hufbauer
a
senior
fellow

trade
expert
at
the
peterson
institut
for
intern
econom
in
washington
said
he
expect
that
there
would
be
littl
to
stop
further
escal
of
the
tariff
war
as
both
side
dig
into
entrench
posit
my
expect
is
that
tariff
on
billion
of
import
from
china
will
be
in
effect
about
a
month
prior
to
the
novemb
elect
that
s
soon
enough
to
be
use
by
trump
as
a
ralli
argument
but
late
enough
so
that
advers
effect
will
not
occur
befor
januari
of
cours
china
will
retali
probabl
dollar
for
dollar
hufbauer
said
china
howev
would
run
out
of
import
to
levi
as
it
bought
onli
billion
worth
