is
actual
the

they
have
the
most
advanc
refin

in

and
will
take
advantag
of
import
more

they
will
export

he
did
not

said
glencor

head
of

alex
beard
echo
the
remark
as
scrubber
unit
to
ship
to
clean
out

would
still
allow
ship
to
mop
up
some
fuel
oil
distil
will
clearli
play
a
veri
larg
role
in

but
what
is
becom
clear
is
that
the

so
it
