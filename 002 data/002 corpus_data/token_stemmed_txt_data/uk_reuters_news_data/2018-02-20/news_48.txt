these

t
make
it
explicit
that
china
is
the
main
driver
behind
the

coal

given
that
the

more
from

the

is
chines

thi

a

it

trade

someth
it

done

for
coal
export
to
be
competit
in

and
also
in
europ
a
thermal
coal
price
of
at
least
a

is
requir
given
the
cost
of
mine
inland
transport
and
ship
in
the

state
chines
import

ha
ensur
that
thermal

price
have
remain
in
the
sweet
spot
for
produc
allow
them
to
be
competit
in
europ
against
export
from
colombia
and
south
africa
as
well
as
in

the
rel
high

use
in
ha
also
help
export
of
thi
fuel
especi
in
india
where
they
compet
against
suppli
from
top
export
australia
the
outlook
for
coal
export
is
larg
and
thi
in
turn
is
larg
a
function
of
how
much
china
import
if
china
come
close
in
to
import
the
million
tonn
it
did
in
then
price
are
like
to
hold
up
provid
miner
with
the
opportun
to
maintain
or
possibl
even
grow
their
export
the
current
balanc
of
risk
is
that
china
s
coal
import
will
moder
somewhat
thi
year
as
the
countri
ramp
up
domest
output
and
continu
it
switch
to
fuel
such
as
natur
ga
if
thi
is
the
case
then
price
may
drift
lower
toward
the
level
where
export
start
to
struggl
especi
in
asia
there
is
also
no
current
suggest
that
china
would
retali
against
the
unit
state
by
target
coal
should
trump
accept
the
recommend
of
the
commerc
depart
for
a
slew
of
curb
and
tariff
on
steel
and
aluminium
import
from
a
varieti
of
export
countri
so
far
the
chines
respons
ha
been
limit
to
say
the
trade
review
report
is
baseless
and
that
it
will
take
step
to
protect
it
interest
if
the
final
decis
affect
china
while
a
trade
war
is
unlik
to
be
in
either
the
interest
of
china
or
the
unit
state
put
barrier
on
coal
import
would
be
a
power
signal
from
beij
aim
straight
at
trump

heartland
