ever
want
to
run
your
electr
car
for
free
if
you
re
open
to
a
bit
of
give
and
take
then
stay
plug
in
and
your
wish
might
come
true
at
least
that
s
what
some
european
power
compani
and
japanes
carmak
believ
and
edf
are
alreadi
work
with
nissan
to
develop
servic
that
allow
power
store
in
electr
vehicl
batteri
to
be
sold
back
to
the

and
now
they
re
tri
to
persuad
european

to
follow
suit
with
million
of

expect
on
european

over
the
next
decad
util
firm
see
both
an
opportun
to
sell
driver
more
electr
and
a
risk
that
surg
in
charg
at
peak
time
could
destabilis
stress
power
grid
that
s
whi
is
work
with
nissan
to
develop
servic
includ
softwar
for
aggreg
and
market
charg
data
so
the
german
power
compani
can
predict
peak
and
trough
in
electr
demand
nissan
s
idea
is
that
if
you
charg
your
electr
vehicl
ev
at
time
and
are
prepar
to
sell
power
back
to
the
grid
when
it

in

that
allow

rather
cc

in

the

tudor
said
one
catch
for

that
