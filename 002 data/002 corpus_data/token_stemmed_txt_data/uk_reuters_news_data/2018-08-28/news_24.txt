china
s
refin
increas
their
output
in
juli
to
close
to
million
barrel
per
day
bpd
but
at
the
same
time
export
of
refin
fuel
fell
to
the
lowest
in
four
month
these
fact
may
seem
contradictori
and
while
there
are
sever
issu
than
can
help
explain
the
dynam
perhap
the
most
compel
is
that
china
appear
to
be
becom
more
attun
to
market
forc
for
refin
product
in
asia
as
is
often
the
case
with
china
s
intak
and
process
of
crude
oil
and
it
export
of
refin
product
the
data
is
incomplet
and
in
thi
case
the
main
miss
number
are
movement
in
inventori
inventori
data
wa
last
releas
in
april
so
it
s
hard
to
know
how
much
of
the
refineri
throughput
went
into
storag
tank
as
oppos
to
be
export
or
consum
domest
but
what
is
known
is
that
refineri
run
total
million
bpd
in
juli
a
gain
of
percent
from
the
same
month
in
in
the
first
seven
month
of
the
year
china
s
refineri
process
million
bpd
an
increas
of
percent
over
the
same
period
last
year
howev
export
of
gasolin
fell
to
tonn
in
juli
equival
to
about
bpd
down
from
bpd
in
june
and
bpd
in
may
diesel
export
fell
to
million
tonn
or
about
bpd
down
from
bpd
in
june
and
bpd
in
may
in
addit
to
the
unknown
flow
into
inventori
gasolin
and
diesel
export
may
have
been
affect
by
chines
refin
get
close
to
exhaust
quota
and
cut
back
on
shipment
it
is
also
possibl
that
the
smaller
independ
refineri
export
less
becaus
of
reduc
run
as
they
battl
higher
crude
oil
price
and
increas
govern
scrutini
on
tax
chines
domest
consumpt
may
also
have
risen
especi
in
the
agricultur
sector
given
the
summer
peak
demand
season
all
of
these
factor
can
help
shed
light
on
the
in
china
s
export
of
refin
fuel
but
perhap
the
best
explan
is
the
movement
of
price
around
the
time
when
juli
export
would
have
been
arrang
the
profit
from
make
a
barrel
of
gasolin
in
singapor
from
brent
crude
the
main
region
benchmark
drop
to
it
low
so
far
thi
year
of
a
barrel
on
juli
it
had
been
steadili
declin
sinc
hit
a
peak
of
a
barrel
on
may
mean
that
at
the
time
chines
refin
would
have
been
contempl
sell
gasolin
for
export
the
incent
to
do
so
wa
weaken
it
s
a
similar
stori
for
diesel
with
the
profit
margin
or
crack
for
produc
a
barrel
of
part
per
million
diesel
from
dubai
crude
drop
to
a
low
of
a
barrel
on
june
down
from
on
may
the
move
in
price
suggest
that
chines
refin
may
have
becom
more
price
sensit
and
therefor
less
like
to
export
surplu
refin
fuel
irrespect
of
the
profit
gain
from
do
so
what
is
also
worth
note
is
that
the
crack
for
both
diesel
and
gasolin
later
strengthen
with
diesel
rise
to
a
barrel
on
befor
slip
slightli
to
end
at
on
monday
the
gasolin
crack
jump
percent
from
it
juli
low
to
a
barrel
on
although
it
subsequ
eas
to
on
monday
the
recoveri
in
the
profit
margin
for
refin
fuel
may
have
come
too
late
to
provid
a
signific
boost
to
china
s
export
in
august
but
septemb
should
reveal
whether
china
s
refin
are
inde
becom
more
or
whether
the
other
factor
still
play
a
bigger
role
the
opinion
express
here
are
those
