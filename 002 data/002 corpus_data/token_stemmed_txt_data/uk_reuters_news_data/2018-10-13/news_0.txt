ad
without

what
those
measur
might
be
under

major
foreign
militari
sale
can
be
block
by
congress
an
inform
review
process
let
key
lawmak
use
a
practic
known
as
a
hold
to
stall
deal
if
they
have
concern
such
as
whether
the
weapon
be
suppli
would
be
use
to
kill
civilian
major
defenc
contractor
includ
lockhe
martin
corp
and
raytheon
co
are
among
the
beneficiari
of
washington
s
close
tie
to
riyadh
and
would
be
hurt
by
the
halt
of
major
arm
deal
trump
said
on
saturday
hi
administr
won
a
billion
militari
order
from
saudi
arabia
and
that
the
deal
combin
with
saudi
commit
to
invest
heavili
in
the
unit
state
wa
worth
hundr
of
thousand
of
job
if
they
don
t
buy
it
from
us
they
re
go
to
buy
it
from
russia
or
they
re
go
to
buy
it
from
china
he
said
think
of
that
billion
all
they
re
go
to
do
is
give
it
to
other
countri
and
i
think
that
would
be
veri
it
wa
unclear
what
specif
measur
if
ani
trump
is
consid
against
saudi
arabia
which
is
the
world
s
largest

trump
ha
urg
saudi
arabia
to
boost
oil
output
to
help
make
up
for
the

trump
said
he
would
probabl
speak
to
saudi
arabia
s
king
salman
over
