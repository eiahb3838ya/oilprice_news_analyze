it
s

that
one
of
the
few
voic

the
main
rival
to
iran
in
the
volatil
middl

the
saudi
stand
to
enjoy
a
windfal

crude
oil
price
may
remain

will
also
like
to
be

becaus
of
the

a
cherri
on

of
thi
is
that
custom
who
had
been
turn
away
from
saudi
crude
such
as
the
world
s
top
import
china
may
be
forc
to
buy
more
from
the

thi
would
allow
the
saudi
to
regain
market

sinc
the

between
the

of
the
petroleum
export
countri
opec
and
alli
such
as
russia
to
reduc
output
in
order
to
tighten
global
oil
market
the
main
risk
for
the
saudi
is
that
the
decis
inflam
an
alreadi
tens
situat
in
the
middl
east
result
in
increas
conflict
and
even
the
possibl
of
outright
war
howev
the
saudi
are
probabl
take
a
calcul
risk
that
the
conflict
situat
won
t
worsen
much
and
in
the
meantim
they
stand
to
gain
a
financi
windfal
and
weaken
their
key
rival
at
the
same
time
whether
the
eventu
realiti
align
with
what
the
saudi
hope
for
is
inher
uncertain
but
there
are
some
point
worth
note
firstli
despit
the
usual
flourish
of
belliger
and
flamboy
in
trump
s
announc
not
much
is
like
to
happen
for
sever
month
thi
is
becaus
the
treasuri
depart
ha
indic
that
sanction
won
t
be
reimpos
immedi
rather
that
it
will
take
up
to
day
to
allow
iranian
oil
custom
and
other
compani
involv
in
do
busi
with
tehran
to
make
plan
it
s
also
not
clear
what
sanction
will
be
reimpos
and
in
what
form
with
the
main
risk
be
the
secondari
sanction
that
would
target
compani
that
do
busi
with
other
entiti
involv
with
iran
thi
mean
for
the
moment
it
is
pure
specul
as
to
how
much
iranian
oil
may
be
lost
to
the
market
most
analyst
estim
seem
to
vari
from
around
to
barrel
per
day
bpd
be
at
risk
which
would
be
enough
to
add
to
an
alreadi
exist
tight
in
global
crude
market
but
it
s
also
worth
note
that
even
the
upper
end
of
thi
rang
could
be
replac
rel
easili
by
the
rest
of
opec
and
it
alli
parti
to
the
agreement
to
restrict
product
in
addit
crude
export
from
the
unit
state
also
have
the
capac
to
increas
especi
if
oil
price
remain
high
therebi
incentivis
shale
produc
to
drill
more
well
in
short
the
global
oil
suppli
chain
can
handl
the
loss
of
bpd
of
iranian
crude
although
do
so
may
come
at
the
cost
of
higher
price
it
also
remain
uncertain
as
to
how
buyer
of
iranian
crude
will
respond
to
the
decis
virtual
all
of
them
from
europ
to
asia
vehement
disagre

s
move
china
s
import
from
iran
were
bpd
in
the
first
quarter
up
percent
from
the
same
period
in
and
enough
to
make
iran
the
supplier
although
the
gap
to

is
miniscul
china
import
million

from
saudi
arabia
in
the
first
quarter
down

make
the

the
second
biggest
supplier
behind
russia
india

s
crude
import
brought
in
bpd
of
iranian
crude
in
the
first
quarter
down
percent
from
the
same
period
last
year
the
south
asian
nation
s
import
from
saudi
arabia
were
up
percent
to
about
bpd
but
the
big
mover
wa
import
from
iraq
up
a
massiv
percent
to
million
bpd
while
both
india
and
china
have
scope
to
lower
their
import
from
iran
they
will
like
be
reluct
especi
given
the
ongo
disput
over
price
between
china
s
top
refin
sinopec
and
saudi

the
most
like
outcom
is
that
asian
crude

will
do
onli
the
barest
minimum
to

the
least
like
outcom
is
that
asian
countri
cooper

in
it
renew
conflict
with
iran
while
the
next

are

it
s
like
the
unit

is
go
to

bend
