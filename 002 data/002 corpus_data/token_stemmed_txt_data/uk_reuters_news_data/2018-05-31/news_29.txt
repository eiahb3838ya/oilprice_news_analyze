with

also
higher

than

such
as

australia
is
the

of

to

behind

and
ha
alreadi

lose

so

thi

and
port
data
compil

reuter
suppli
chain
and
commod
forecast
show
a
total
of
million
tonn
of
australian
coal
be
discharg
in
south
korea
in
the
first
five
month
of
thi
year
down
percent
from
the
same
period
in
while
coal
import
from
australia
held
up
well
in
the
first
four
month
they
have
fallen
sharpli
in
may
to
million
tonn
accord
to
the
data
thi
is
a
drop
of
percent
from
may
of

show
that
south

util
are
alreadi
attempt
to
sourc
coal
from
produc
custom
data
for
the
first
four
month
of
show
that
south
korea
import
million
tonn
from
australia
down
from
million
for
the
same
period
in
from
indonesia
import
drop
to
million
tonn
from
million
while
those
from
russia
jump
to
million
from
million
and
south
african
shipment
rose
to
million
from
million
what
thi
suggest
is
that
south
korean
util
are
cut
back
on
import
from
australia
but
aren
t
switch
to
indonesia
rather
prefer
to
buy
more
from
russia
and
south
africa
thi
mean
that
the
util
are
still
seek
higher
energi
coal
but
with
a
lower
sulphur
content
such
as
that
produc
in
russia
and
south
africa
indonesia
s
coal
tend
to
be
low
sulphur
but
also
of
low
calorif
valu
mean
more
ha
to
be
burn
to
produc
the
same
amount
of
energi
the
question
for
the
seaborn
coal
market
is
how
much
impact
will
south
korea
s
switch
to
coal
have
given
that
it
is
the
world
s
import
behind
china
india
and
japan
in
theori
price
for
australian
coal
should
declin
while
those
for
south
african
and
russian
suppli
should
advanc
but
the
realiti
may
be
more
nuanc
than
that
about
million
tonn
of
australia
s
annual
thermal
coal
export
meet
the
new
south
korean
specif
accord
to
consult
wood
mackenzi
that
s
less
than
a
quarter
of
the
countri
s
total
annual
thermal
coal
export
but
is
still
suffici
larg
to
enabl
south
korean
util
to
switch
to
buy
onli
cargo
what
thi
may
mean
in
practic
term
is
that
australian
coal
start
to
enjoy
a
rise
premium
over
fuel
with
a
higher
sulphur
content
even
if
the
calorif
valu
are
the
same
thi
may
benefit
buyer
in
countri
such
as
japan
and
china
who
may
be
abl
to
buy
higher
sulphur
australian
coal
and
would
be
happi
to
take
it
at
a
discount
to
what
they
are
current
pay
chines
util
are
known
to
buy
but
indonesian
coal
for
blend
with
higher
energi
coal
the
price
for
south
african
coal
may
also
move
higher
if
south
korea
start
to
boost
demand
and
there
is
some
evid
in
the
price
that
thi
is
occur
the
price
of
coal
at
south
africa
s
main
export
port
of
richard
bay
as
assess
by
argu
media
end
last
week
at
a
tonn
while
the
price
of
similar
grade
coal
at
australia
s
newcastl
port
wa
at
thi
mean
the
australian
coal
wa
at
a
a
tonn
premium
to
the
south
african
fuel
which
is
down
from
the
at
the
end
of
last
year
there
are
of
cours
other
reason
for
south
african
coal
to
outperform
australian
includ
rise
demand
from
south
asian
countri
such
as
pakistan
howev
russian
coal
in
the
pacif
market
also
seem
to
have
outperform
australian
slightli
in
recent
month
with
the
price
at
the
port
of
vostochni
in
nakhodka
end
last
week
at
below
the
newcastl
equival
narrow
from
the
a
tonn
that
prevail
in
while
the
seaborn
market
is
like
to
adjust
to
the
new
south
korean
rule
by
shift
around
who
buy
what
from
whom
it
s
unlik
that
thi
will
signal
a
dramat
shift
in
price
howev
the
market
should
also
consid
the
question
as
to
whether
south
korea
is
the
harbing
of
more
restrict
on
sulphur
which
would
have
more
seriou
consequ
for
australia
and
for
the
oper
cost
of
asian
