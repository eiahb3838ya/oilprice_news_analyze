been
comfort
with

now
risk
a

call
the
most
like
way
to
resolv
the
differ

between

is
for

produc
to
accept
that
they
may
have
to
partner
more
with
their
custom
while
accept
flexibl
and
smaller
contract
buyer
will
have
to
realis
that
they
no
longer
hold
the
whip
hand
and
will
have
to
start
commit
to
deal
to
boost
suppli
in
their
own
interest
and
financi
such
as
bank
and
develop
agenc
also
have
to
adjust
their
think
as
the
old
world
of
a
few
major
buyer
commit
to
deal
in

to
underpin
a

is
now
gone
instead
the
