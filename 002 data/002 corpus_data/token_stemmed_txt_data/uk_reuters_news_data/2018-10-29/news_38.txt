it
may
be
stretch
the
bow
too
far
to
blame
donald
trump
for
the
collaps
in
the
profit
asian
refin
get
for
make
gasolin
or
inde
for
the
surg
in
diesel
profit
but
the
polici
of
the
presid
are
certainli
play
a
role
the
profit
margin
on
produc
gasolin
at
a
typic
singapor
refineri
drop
to
per
barrel
of
brent
crude
on
the
lowest
in

accord
to
refinitiv
data
at
the
same
time
the
profit
or
crack
for
make
a
barrel
of
gasoil
with
part
per
million
of
sulphur
the
base
for
diesel
and
jet
fuel
reach
abov
the
price
of
a
barrel
of
dubai
crude
on
the

sinc
februari
thi
mean
that
asian
refin
are
make
larg
profit
from
produc
diesel
and
jet
fuel
but
bare
scrape
by
on
gasolin
howev
the
strong
profit
for
the
fuel
mean
the
refin
are
still
incentivis
to
maximis
their
crude
throughput
that
mean
they
will
continu
to
produc
larg
volum
of
gasolin
even
though
it
s
hardli
worth
their
while
to
do
so
how
doe
trump
fit
into
thi
pictur
the
main
influenc
are
the
unintend
of
hi
administr
s
ongo
trade
war
with
china
and
the
renew
sanction
against
iran
s
crude
oil
export
the
escal
trade
disput
with
china
ha
led
the
author
in
beij
to
onc
again
open
the
infrastructur
spend
tap
in
a
bid
to
stave
off
a
slowdown
in
their
economi
caus
by
the
imposit
of
tariff
on
import
from
china
thi
ha
had
the
impact
of
increas
domest
diesel
demand
which
ha
led
to
a
reduct
on
chines
export
of
the
transport
fuel
china
s
export
of
diesel
in
septemb
drop
to
a
low
of
million
tonn
or
about
barrel
per
day
bpd
accord
to
custom
data
releas
on
in
the
first
eight
month
of
the
year
china
s
diesel
export
had
averag
bpd
and
in
may
they
reach
bpd
the
highest
month
so
far
in
the
surg
in
china
s
diesel
export
in
may
also
coincid
with
the
weakest
profit
margin
for
asian
refin
produc
the
fuel
with
the
crack
drop
from
to
late
june
when
it
hit
a
low
for
of
a
barrel
on
june
lower
diesel
export
from
china
are
like
to
have
help
push
the
profit
margin
to
it
recent
high
but
it
s
also
worth
note
that
asian
refin
are
find
it
harder
to
sourc
barrel
of
heavi
sour
crude
grade
these
typic
yield
more
middl
distil
such
as
diesel
and
jet
fuel
and
fewer
light
distil
like
gasolin
and
naphtha
the
trump
administr
s
renew
sanction
on
iran
s
crude
export
come
into
effect
on
but
major
buyer
in
asia
such
as
india
have
alreadi
cut
back
on
purchas
from
the
islam
republ
while
china
ha
yet
to
curtail
it
buy
from
iran
indic
are
that
it
will
do
so
from
next
month
it
s
also
like
that
much
of
the
iranian
crude
head
to
china
will
be
place
in
bond
storag
tank
mean
it
won
t
clear
custom
and
is
therefor
unavail
to
chines
refin
overal
the
impact
ha
been
to
reduc
the
amount
of
heavi
crude
avail
to
asian
refin
mani
of
which
oper
complex
plant
capabl
of
maximis
diesel
and
jet
fuel
output
from
thi
type
of
crude
the
reduct
in
cargo
head
to
asia
from
venezuela
anoth
heavi
crude
produc
ha
exacerb
the
situat
some
refin
have
been
turn
to
lighter
crude
from
russia
the
unit
state
and
west
africa
to
replac
heavi
crude
which
have
also
becom
more
expens
thi
ha
increas
the
amount
of
gasolin
avail
in
asia
contribut
to
a
reduct
in
the
profit
margin
for
make
the
fuel
predomin
use
by
light
vehicl
the
gasolin
glut
may
becom
wors
in
the
come
week
as
china
ha
issu
new
fuel
export
quota
these
will
like
increas
the
amount
of
fuel
be
export
there
is
a
further
interest
dynam
at
play
at
the
retail
level
in
sever
countri
in
the
region
gasolin
price
haven
t
drop
much
at
all
for
consum
in
india
and
china
gasolin
price
are
higher
than
those
for
diesel
while
in
australia
gasolin
is
onli
slightli
cheaper
while
chines
retail
price
may
well
be
describ
as
manag
accord
to
movement
in
the
crude
price
those
in
india
and
australia
are
larg
set
by
market
forc
if
there
is
a
glut
of
gasolin
in
the
region
it
would
be
logic
to
expect
refin
to
tri
and
clear
it
by
lower
price
in
order
to
stimul

but
thi
hasn
t
happen
so
far
