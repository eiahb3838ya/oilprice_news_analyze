chang
in

recycl
in

say
they
are
plan
to
scale
up
capac
but
that
to
make
it
worthwhil
there
need
to
be
more
buyer
for
recycl
plastic
closer
to
home
in
the
meantim
they
have
found
market
in
other
part
of

for
just
over
half
the
wast
that
use
to
go
to

and
say
much
of

rest
is
be

rais
the
risk
of

effort
which
vari
wide

if

import

we
can
not

we
have
no
more
buyer
said

the
right
answer
is
for
author
to
chang
the
paradigm
and
boost
the
incorpor
of
secondari
divis
within
the

and
warn
from
compani
that
incorpor
recycl

will
lower
the
qualiti
of

increas
