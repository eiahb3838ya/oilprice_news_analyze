column-trump takes the 2019 outlook for commodities hostage: russell

australia
reuter
forecast
the
outlook
for
commod
while
popular
among
analyst
is
a
bit
of
a
mug
s
game
at
the
best
of
time
but
the
view
for
is
made
even
more
complic
by
one
volatil
factor
donald
trump
while
there
are
other
driver
of
commod
price
next
year
the
mercuri
presid
loom
larg
over
the
sector
and
the
action
of
hi
administr
will
either
amplifi
or
partial
nullifi
the
establish
trend
befor
tri
to
deciph
trump
s
like
action
it
s
worth
look
at
the
trend
like
to
move
commod
market
in
chief
among
these
is
increas
concern
about
slower
global
econom
growth
with
particular
worri
over
china
the
world
s
economi
and
the
biggest
import
of
commod
there
are
roughli
two
school
of
thought
on
china
the
first
be
that
the
countri
will
have
to
endur
lower
growth
and
tighter
credit
condit
as
it
struggl
to
overcom
tariff
on
it
export
and
slower
growth
in
other
trade
partner
the
second
is
that
onc
again
beij
will
success
manag
to
open
the
spend
tap
and
the
subsequ
raft
of
infrastructur
and
construct
project
will
keep
commod
demand
healthi
and
econom
growth
abov
the
percent
level
the
second
scenario
would
be
support
for
import
and
price
for
bulk
commod
such
as
iron
ore
and
coal
and
for
industri
metal
most
notabl
copper
howev
it
s
also
worth
note
that
much
of
what
beij
is
like
to
do
is
depend
on
how
it
trade
disput
with
the
unit
state
unfold
trump
and
hi
chines
counterpart
xi
jinp
appear
to
reach
some
sort
of
detent
at
the
recent
meet
in
argentina
but
it
s
still
an
open
question
as
to
whether
thi
can
morph
into
an
agreement
accept
to
both
side
the
pattern
of
the
disput
so
far
ha
been
dictat
by
trump
who
ha
altern
between
ramp
up
rhetor
and
calm
it
down
which
doe
littl
more
than
creat
opportun
for
volatil
trader
the
real
question
to
be
answer
is
whether
both
china
and
the
unit
state
are
prepar
to
weather
the
pain
of
an
extend
trade
disput
it
s
like
to
be
the
case
that
the
countri
upon
which
the
most
tariff
are
impos
in
thi
case
china
will
feel
the
econom
cost
first
but
the
unit
state
will
also
eventu
feel
the
fallout
through
higher
cost
of
good
rise
inflat
lower
consum
spend
and
a
loss
of
competit
in
industri
no
longer
expos
to
intern
rival
how
these
dynam
play
out
larg
depend
on
trump
s
action
the
leader
may
come
under
increas
pressur
from
within
hi
republican
parti
to
reach
an
accommod
with
china
if
the
economi
start
to
slow
and
the
equiti
market
continu
their
recent
downward
trend
trump
ha
stake
much
of
hi
presid
s
success
on
deliv
a
strong
economi
with
high
return
for
investor
and
if
thi
is
challeng
it
may
forc
him
to
seek
way
to
maintain
econom
momentum
howev
trump
is
also
like
to
be
distract
by
hi
mount
legal
difficulti
and
by
the
takeov
of
the
hous
of
repres
by
the
democrat
parti
the
threat
of
legal
action
and
further
investig
into
hi
affair
as
well
as
hi
friendli
toward
saudi
arabia
and
russia
also
are
a
major
factor
like
to
influenc
crude
oil
the
trump
administr
effect
kick
the
can
on
it
of
sanction
against
iran
over
it
nuclear
programm
down
the
road
until
april
when
the
import
waiver
grant
to
tehran
s
biggest
custom
are
set
to
expir
thi
is
like
to
ignit
debat
over
whether
the
crude
oil
market
will
tighten
if
trump
doe
end
the
waiver
allow
iran
to
export
or
whether
shale
output
will
be
enough
to
keep
the
market
in
surplu
the
interplay
between
trump
embattl
saudi
crown
princ
moham
bin
salman
and
russian
strong
man
vladimir
putin
will
also
be
key
for
the
action
taken
by
the
world
s
three
largest
oil
produc
the
troubl
for
analyst
is
that
there
is
no
way
to
be
certain
how
all
the
factor
around
trump
will
develop
hi
legal
woe
may
amount
to
littl
or
they
may
lead
to
hi
impeach
and
remov
from
offic
trump
may
reach
a
deal
with
china
that
end
the
tariff
war
or
he
may
not
and
it
could
escal
he
may
realli
crack
down
on
iran
s
oil
export
or
he
may
not
in
some
way
commod

have
becom
unwit
hostag
to

man
like
