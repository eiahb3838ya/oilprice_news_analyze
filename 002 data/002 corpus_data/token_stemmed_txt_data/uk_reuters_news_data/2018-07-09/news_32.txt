brian

said
on

we
are
not
look
to

on
the
of

becaus
we
believ
pressur
is
critic
to
achiev
our

secur
but
if
the

succe
in
reduc
iran
s
crude
export
close
to
zero
from

in
line
with
it
state
polici
saudi
arabia
would
have
to
rais
it
product
to
unpreced
level
to
cover
the
loss
and
it
would
leav
the
global
market
tighter
than
at
ani
time
sinc
the
oil
shock
of
and
with
result
upward
pressur
on

the
administr
ha
not
been
clear
about
whether
sanction
will
appli
just
to
crude
or
will
includ
condens
brief
with
an
iran
diplomaci
updat
state

but
assum
sanction
appli
onli
to

the
global
market
would
still
need
to
replac
more
than
million
barrel
per
day
bpd
of
iranian
export
from
the
start
of

accord
to
the

from

export
between

between

the
question
is
where
will
the

come
from
the

other

market
analyst
put
the
spare
capac
figur
for
opec
and
member
significantli
lower
than
the
iea
which
impli
the
market
is
even
tighter
but
use
the
iea
s
figur
it
is
clear
saudi
arabia
would
have
to
replac
most
of
the
iranian
barrel
lost
as
a
result
of
sanction
the
kingdom
would
need
to
increas
product
and
export
by
at
least
million
bpd
to
cover
the
total
loss
of
iranian
barrel
the
requir
increas
would
be
even
higher
if
other
opec
and
countri
struggl
to
rais
their
output
or
more
product
is
lost
as
a
result
of
problem
in
venezuela
and
libya
in
theori
there
is
suffici
spare
capac
in
saudi
arabia
and
other
countri
but
it
would
leav
the
global
market
with
less
than
million
bpd
of
capac
left
to
meet
all
other
conting
in
practic
some
analyst
think
the
market
could
be
much
tighter
with
sanction
essenti
use
up
all
the
spare
capac
worldwid
the
iea
estim
saudi
arabia
could
rais
product
to
just
over
million
bpd
and
sustain
it
at
that
level
for
an
extend
period
saudi
arabia
ha
alreadi
use
some
of
it
spare
capac
to
increas
product
by
bpd
from
million
bpd
in

to
million

in

the

but
accord
to
the

the

ha
not

on

or
million

in

saudi
arabia
ha
report
roughli
similar

number
to

in

it
is
possibl
the
kingdom
could
lift

by

million
bpd
beyond
anyth
it
ha
ever

befor
but
at
the
moment
there
is
no
way
of
know
for
certain
some
observ
question
whether
such
high
rate
of
product
could
be
implement
quickli
and
sustain
for
ani
length
of
time
maximum

would
requir
open
the

bring

boost

thi
way
might
risk
a
declin
in

pressur
that
could
result
in

some

in
which
case
it
is
not
strictli
speak
spare

at

and
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
pipelin
process
plant
and
export
termin
have
enough
capac
to
handl
million
bpd
becaus
such
high
flow
rate
have
never
been
test
saudi
arabia
could
boost
volum
suppli
to
the
market
by
releas
some
of
it
domest
crude

would

sinc
their

of

onto

if
saudi

need
to

iranian
barrel
most
of
the

will
have
to
come
from
more
pump
rather

releas
and
it
would
requir
produc
more

than
saudi

ha

befor
stringent
sanction
on

will
take
both
saudi

and
the
oil

into
