it

also
lower

in

possibl
that
there

last

a

suggest
that
the

had
an
immedi
and
profound
impact
it
s
believ
the

the
step
to

over

thi
grade

is
gener
prefer
by

becaus
of
it

while
those

down
by
a

from

it
would
be
logic
to
expect

if

that

the

australian
thermal

struggl

from
the

s
other
major
export
indonesia
and
south

but
the
recent

declin

may
make

well
abov
the

some
of
the
differ
will
be
eaten
up
by
the
longer
sea
journey
from
australia
s
east
coast
to
india
but
the
likelihood
is
that
indian
buyer
may
well
be
open
to
pick

australian

that
becom

becaus
of

howev
coal

interest
given
the

is
highli

sensit
and
cut
back
on
import
when
price
are
strong
as
they
have
been
in

and
port
data
show
that
india
import
million
tonn
of
all

in
the
first
quarter
a
monthli
rate
of

tonn
thi
is
below
the

that
while

it
