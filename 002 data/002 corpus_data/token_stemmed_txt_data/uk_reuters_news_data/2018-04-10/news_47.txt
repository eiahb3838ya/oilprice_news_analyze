the

is
in

where
price
for

are
higher
than
those
for

thi
suggest
to
the
market
that
aramco
would
lower
their
osp
as
the
compani
usual
set
it

crude
aramco
doesn
t
disclos
reason
for
chang
in

price
leav
the
market
somewhat
nonpluss
at
the
action
the
most
plausibl
explan
for
the
deviat
from
previou
practic
is
that
aramco
is
do
it
best
to
keep
oil
price
high
ahead
of
it
plan
initi
public
offer
ipo
the
list
which
is
slate
for
later
thi
year
but
is
probabl
more
like
in
need
a
strong
oil
price
to
be
success
with
a
figur
abov
a
barrel
seen
as
a
minimum
brent
crude
is
current
around
a

mean
the
saudi
have
to
continu
to
do
everyth
possibl
to
keep
the
price
bias
higher
up
to
now
the
main
vehicl
for
boost
price
ha
been
the
deal
to
cut

struck
by
the

countri
opec

russia
the
surpris
increas
in
the

for
it
major
custom
in

may
be
anoth
tactic
aim
at
keep
oil
price
strong
but
as
the
sinopec
reaction
show
aramco
may
end
up
with
the
worst
of
possibl
outcom
it
s
like
to
continu
to
surrend
market
share
to

in
china
and
if
sinopec
ha
no

obtain
altern

it
undermin

narr
that

are
tight
and
price
should
rise
further
saudi
arabia
use
to
be
china
s
largest
supplier
of

but
ha
lost
that
spot
to
russia
in
the

chines

rose

these
show

down

those
from

rose

if
angola
continu
to

it
may

overtak
saudi

to

thi

a
possibl
that
