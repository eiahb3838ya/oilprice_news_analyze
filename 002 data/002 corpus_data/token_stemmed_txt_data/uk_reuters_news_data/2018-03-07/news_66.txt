opec

polici
under
the
de
facto
leadership
of
saudi
arabia
ha
altern
between
support

and
defend
market
share
in
an
ideal
world
opec
would
like
to
protect
both
but
in
practic
the
two
object
are
in

with

anoth

earli
opec
focus

despit
lose

start

last
through

the

switch
to
focu
on

allow

sinc
decemb
opec
and
it
s
alli
have
revert
to

defenc
accept
a
reduct
in
their
market
share
again
opec
polici
is
cyclic
so
at
some
point
the
focu
will
revert
to
market
share
when
the
loss
of
custom
becom
too
pain
but
there
are
sever
reason
to
think
the
switch
might
be
delay
thi
time
around
opec
ha
alway
been
slow
to
react
to
chang
market
condit
after
previou

the
organis
allow
the
market
to
tighten
too
much
rather
than
risk
not
tighten
it
enough
by
allow

to
rise
too
far
for
too
long
opec

howev
the

is
still

for
the

includ
saudi

higher

more

there
is

maximis
the

later
thi

whether
