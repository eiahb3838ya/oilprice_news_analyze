polici
under
the
de

of

ha
altern

in
an

opec
would
like
to
protect
both
but
in

the

start

have

defenc
accept
a

in

again
opec

is
cyclic
so
at
some
point
the
focu
will
revert
to
market
share
when
the
loss
of
custom
becom
too
pain
but
there
are
sever
reason
to
think
the
switch
might
be
delay
thi
time
around
opec

alway
been
slow
to

market
condit
after

the

allow
the

to
tighten
too
much
rather
than
risk
not

it
enough
by
allow

too
far
for

opec

howev
