the

s
view
is
that

it
ha
still
lift
it

forecast
to
factor
in

uncertainti
the
ironi
here
is
that
china
is
alreadi
a
huge
export
not
of
primari
aluminium
but
rather
of
aluminium
in
the
form
of

inde
such
ha
been
the
flood
of

out
of
the
countri
that
up

now
the
big
issu
for

ha
been
how
to
stop
china
export
so
much
not
how
to
stimul
it
to

more
the
unit

ha
led
the
polit
push
back
against

of

thi
is
the
dilemma
for

the
