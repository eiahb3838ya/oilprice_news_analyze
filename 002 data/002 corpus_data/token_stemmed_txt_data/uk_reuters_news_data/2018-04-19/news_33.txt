to

but
ani

consid
thi
will
be
awar
of
the
furiou
reaction
it
would
gener
from

activist
the
other
issu
for
australia
is
that
domest
natur
ga
price
have
risen
sharpli
and
are
now
trade
more
in
line
with
asian
spot
lng
price
the
price
of
natur
ga
at
the
wallumbilla
hub
in
queensland
as
assess
by
argu
media
wa
per
million
british
thermal
unit
last
week
while
spot
asian
lng
wa
onc
the
cost
of
the
lng
is
net
back
to
the
hub
the
two
price
are
more
or
less
in
line
mean
australia
s
domest
custom
are
pay
for
their
natur
ga
at
valu
link
to
intern
price
thi
is
a
shift
from
what
happen
prior
to
the
three
lng
plant
be
built
in
queensland
when
domest
natur
ga
wa
cheaper
and
gener
sold
in
contract
ad
natur
ga
from
the
territori
to
australia
s
suppli
mix
may
help
lower
price
for
both
feedstock
for
the
lng
plant
and
domest
custom
but
the
point
is
that
thi
extra
product
is
still
sever
year
away
in
the
meantim
pressur
is
go
to
mount
on
domest
natur
ga
supplier
and
consum
lead
to
polit
fallout
and
seemingli
odd
solut
such
as
bring
a
float
ship
to
melbourn
and
import
lng
it
seem
ludicr
that
australia
which
will
overtak
qatar
as
the
world
s
top
export
of
lng
onc
the
last
of
eight
new
project
come
onlin
later
thi
year
will
turn
to
import
the
fuel
in
order
to
meet
domest
demand
it
seem
logic
to
develop
onshor
natur
ga
resourc
rather
than
import
lng
but
thi
ignor
the
increas
influenc
of
environment
activist
who
are
commit
to
end
all
fossil

product
in
favour
of
renew

while
some

ignor
the
scientif

support
frack
other
simpli
shift
to
say
that

product
contribut

chang
and
should
be
ban
for
thi
reason
ani
compani
engag
in
frack
in

can
expect
to
be

by

which
may
deter
some

the
