not

larg
an
expens
farc
the
upshot
is
that
australia
s
energi
polici
ha
been
a
mess
for
the
last
year
at
a
time
when
retail
electr
price
have
more
than
doubl
and
the
countri
ha
experienc
widescal
blackout
in
the
wake
of
the
closur
of
sever
old
power
plant
with
the
neg
all
but
dead
and
buri
it
seem
that
a
comprehens
energi
polici
will
not
be
deliv
ani
time
soon
under
australia
s
feder
system
thi
mean
the
six
state
and
two
territori
govern
will
larg
be
respons
for
their
own
energi
polici
howev
there
are
a
few
thing
that
are
probabl
clear
for
the
futur
of
energi
polici
the
first
is
that
it
highli
unlik
a
new
power
plant
will
ever
be
built
in
australia
despit
the
countri
be
the
world
s
largest
export
of
the
pollut
fuel
and
it
role
in
provid
more
than
percent
of
current
power
gener
no
major
util
ha
ani
interest
in
invest
billion
of
dollar
into
a
coal
plant
especi
given
polici
uncertainti
and
the
certainti
of
public
opposit
and
protest
to
such
a
move
thi
leav
state
govern
as
the
onli
player
like
to
build
gener
and
while
it
is
possibl
they
may
seek
to
extend
the
life
of
some
exist
plant
they
too
would
be
wari
of
invest
in
a
fuel
that
take
the
blame
for
much
of
the
current
concern
over
climat
chang
natur
ga
also
present
problem
given
the
difficulti
in
get
the
fuel
from
where
it
is
produc
mainli
northern
and
central
australia
to
where
it
is
need
mainli
the
southeast
the
last
of
eight
project
is
due
to
start
thi
year
which
will
make
australia
the
world
s
largest
export
of
the
fuel
howev
the
rapid
scale
up
of
lng
export
ha
also
meant
that
domest
ga
price
have
risen
to
reflect
intern
lng
price
and
local
consum
are
struggl
to
secur
suppli
under
contract
thi
ha
rais
the
possibl
of
lng
import
to
citi
like
melbourn
australia
s
and
home
to
much
of
the
countri
s
manufactur
base
what
initi
seem
like
a
fix
may
end
up
be
a
structur
featur
of
the
lng
market
in
which
australia
ship
lng
to
asia
but
buy
from
other
countri
to
meet
it
domest
need
the
other
thing
that
appear
virtual
certain
is
that
the
main
invest
in
electr
gener
in
australia
is
go
to
be
in
the
form
of
renew
both
and
small
rooftop
system
solar
and
wind
farm
with
batteri
backup
are
alreadi
in
exist
in
south
australia
state
and
sever
more
are
plan
pump
hydropow
use
wind
and
solar
to
pump
water
from
a
lower
reservoir
back
to
a
higher
one
to
be
use
to
gener
power
in
period
of
higher
demand
is
also
like
with
extens
to
exist
project
in
tasmania
state
and
the
snowi
mountain
that
straddl
victoria
and
new
south
wale
state
the
seemingli
retail
power
bill
are
also
drive
consum
to
rooftop
solar
with
batteri
storag
which
could
result
in
lower
demand
from
the
grid
but
also
could
serv
as
a
for
the
grid
assum
consum
are
encourag
to
make
their
excess
power
and
batteri
storag
avail
the
ultim
ironi
is
that
australia
is
on
the
verg
of
lose
a
fourth
prime
minist
in
a

partli
becaus
of
