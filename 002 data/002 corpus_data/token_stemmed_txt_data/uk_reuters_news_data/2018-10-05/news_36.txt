world
more
than
major
citi
have
pledg
to
end
their
relianc
on
fossil
fuel
and
stop
pump
out
emiss
by
but
copenhagen
a
citi
of
wind
turbin
bicycl
and
reliabl
public
transport
think
it
can
go
even
further
it
intend
to
accomplish
that
shift
in
just
seven
year
it
will
requir
a
complet
reimagin
of
how
the
danish
capit
is
power
and
design
and
a
lot
of
cyclist
offici
admit
whi
are
we
go
for
that
peopl
might
say
what
we
do
in
copenhagen
doesn
t
realli
matter
on
the
global
stage
at
all
we
are
tini
said
jørgen
abildgaard
director
of
the
citi
s
climat
programm
but
with
citi
and
countri
around
the
world
still
search
for
way
to
turn
the
pari
agreement
on
climat
chang
into
a
realiti
it
s
import
to
show
that
it
s
possibl
to
make
thi
transit
he
told
the
thomson
reuter
foundat
scandinavian
citi
have
long
been
seen
as
green
leader
and
copenhagen
is
no
except
while
other
citi
have
park
garag
for

copenhagen
ha
them
for
bicycl
virtual
all
it
resid
own
a
bicycl
and
the
citi
ha
kilometr
of
dedic
cycl
lane
the
municip
also
is
mostli
power
by
clean
energi
and
it
ha
it
own
renew
energi
compani
and
wind
turbin
run
it
own
energi
system
is
one
of
the
reason
copenhagen
is
alreadi
well
on
track
to
be
carbon
neutral
mean
it
will
produc
no
more
carbon
emiss
than
it
can
offset
elsewher
by
the
citi
s
concert
effort
to
go
green
put
it
firmli
ahead
of
the
schedul
set
by
almost
nation
in
pari
to

phase
out
greenhous
gase
between
and
lead
climat
scientist
will
warn
next

that
global
carbon
emiss
from

use
will
have
to
plung
by
up
to
seven
percent
a
year
to
meet
pari
toughest
goal
unless
technolog

to
a

obtain
by

copenhagen
s
offici
are
confid
the
citi
can
larg
achiev
it
ambiti
goal
we
want
to
be
percent
carbon
neutral
by
but
if
we
are
percent
or
around
that
it
s
still
a
big
success
said
abildgaard
who
ha
overseen
the
citi
s
effort
toward
carbon
neutral
ever
sinc
it
made
it
pledg
in
when
it
host
climat

in
copenhagen
produc
about
million
tonn
of
gase
down
percent
from
accord
to
citi
figur
that
s
about
tonn
of
emiss
per

one
of
the
lowest
rate
for
a
european
citi
the
citi
said
the
reduct
in
emiss
wa
larg
due
to
a
switch
to
wind
energi
under
hofor
the
citi
s
own
util
compani
we
are
some
of
the
muscl
that
the
citi
ha
to
be
abl
to
use
to
reach
it
goal
said
jörgen
edström
head
of
strategi
and
busi
develop
at
hofor
one
of
mani
energi
compani
in
the
citi
the
citi
want
to
build
windmil
to
compens
for
it
electr
consumpt
so
we
built
windmil
they
have
a
compani
to
do
the
thing
they
want
to
do
he
said
hofor
ha
invest
billion
of
euro
to
build
wind
turbin
by
to
power
most
of
the
citi
and
will
soon
replac
it
power
plant
with

that
burn

the

say
around
the

citi
consum
more
than
of

and
account
for
about

carbon
dioxid
emiss
accord
to
the
unit
nation
that
mean
find
way
for
citi
to
becom
carbon

will
be
key
to
meet
the
pari

to
keep
the
rise
in

temperatur
to
well
below

celsiu
abov
level
citi
are
where
the

are
the
largest
so
if

can
solv
the
problem
then
that
s
part
of
the
way
to
a
more

edström

where

that

edström
