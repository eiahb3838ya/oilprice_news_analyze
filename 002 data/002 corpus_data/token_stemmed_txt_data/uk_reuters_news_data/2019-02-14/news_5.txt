he
indic
in

on
that
big

would
not
be

last
spring
to
increas
purchas
of
good
choos
instead
to
proceed
with

the
two
side
could
report
some
progress
toward
a
deal
and
may
extend
the
march
deadlin
to
keep
negoti
as
often
happen
dure
talk
last
year
to
replac
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
or
nafta
a
stalem
on
core
structur

would
be
view
as
a
neg
sign
and
investor
would
brace
for
higher

trade
negoti
often
go
down
to

a
final
outcom
is
not
