the
risk
of
a
chaotic

the

to

say
robert
herman
refin
execut
at
phillip
some
refin
have
invest
in
cut
sulfur
in
their
output
but
fit
hydrocrack
or
coker
unit
so
that
a
refineri
produc
more
distil
with
lower

content
while

can
cost

analyst
say
small

unabl
to

the
upgrad
may
find

churn
out

without

a
kbc
consult

show
percent

european
plant
which
tend
to
be
less
complex
than
those
in

produc
more

and
may
face
the
biggest
challeng
morgan
stanley
say
refineri
of
spain

repsol
turkey
s
tupra
india
s
relianc
and
independ
valero
are
among
the
best
prepar
becaus
they
alreadi
produc
high
middl
distil
and
low
fuel
oil
the
simplest
way
for
refineri
to
produc
fuel
with
less
sulfur
is
to
buy
and
process
crude
that
contain
less
sulfur
a
shift
that
could
chang
demand
for
differ
oil
grade
and
lead
to
greater

produc
about

there
will
be
a

war
for

said
stephen
georg
chief

with

advanc

thi
could
hike
the

includ

the

sour
crude
with

such

valu
he
said
energi
firm

may
face
a
squeez
on
