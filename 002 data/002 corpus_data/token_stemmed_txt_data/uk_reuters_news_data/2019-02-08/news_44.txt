singapor
is
develop
one
of
the
world
s
largest
offshor
float
solar
system
in
the
strait
of
johor
to
the
north
of
the
island
in
countri
like
singapor
the
widespread
use
of
pv

is
hinder
by
space
constraint
and
limit

said
frank
phuan
chief
execut
offic
of
sunseap
group
which
is
build
the
system
the
platform
ha
to
be
more
robust
than
system
in
reservoir
or
lake
to
withstand
tougher
condit
on
the
open
sea
and
to
overcom
barnacl
that
may
grow
on
it
he
said
it
wa
also
difficult
to
find
a
spot
in
the
sea
that
wa
not
frequent
by
ship
vessel
he
said
despit
these
challeng
float
solar
system
are
grow
quickli
in

alongsid
those
on
the
ground
and
on
roof
accord
to
the
solar
energi
research
institut
of
singapor
seri
while
float
panel
are
more
expens
to
instal
they
are
up
to
percent
more
effici
becaus
the
water
s
cool
effect
help
reduc
thermal
loss
and
extend
their
life
accord
to
seri
the
panel
also
reduc
evapor
from
water
bodi
when

are
warm

for

the
greater
effici
offset
the
higher
cost
of
instal
said
celin
paton
a
senior

analyst
at
seri
technolog
advanc
should
soon
bring
them
on
par
with
ground
system
in
term
of
cost
she
told
the
thomson
reuter
foundat
southeast
asia
is
particularli
well
suit
for
float
panel
becaus
of
the
scarciti
of
land
and
becaus
they
can
be
easili
instal
in
the

where
they
can

she
said
china
current
account
for
most
of
the
more

gigawatt
of
float
solar
capac
now
instal
accord
to
the
world
bank
india
recent
announc
a
plan
to
develop
gw
of
float
solar
capac
the
technolog
s
potenti
is
about
gw
or
about
as
much
gener
capac
as
all
the
solar
photovolta
panel
instal
in
the
world
through
the
world
bank
said
there
are
concern
that
the
panel
could
block
sunlight
affect
marin
life
and
ecosystem
and
that
the
electr
system
might
not
withstand
the
onslaught
of
water
but
backer
say
the
technolog
is
proven
and
that
the
panel
cover
too
small
a
surfac
area
to
creat
major
problem
the
first
float
pv
system
wa
instal
as
recent
as
so
there
are
still
some
unknown
said

but
it
s
not
a
contest
with
