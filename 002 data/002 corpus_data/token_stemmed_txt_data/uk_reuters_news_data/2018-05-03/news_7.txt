depart
their
american
interlocutor
sever
of

said
they
were
sceptic
the

and
all
said
the

damag
limit
scenario
if
it
fail
we
have
a
week
to
continu
talk
to
the
american
to
see
if
we
can
find
an
agreement
on
the
deal
said
a
senior
european
diplomat
but
i
don
t
think
there
is
ani
reason
to
be
overli
the
polit
agreement
which
is
a
culmin
of
transatlant
diplomaci
doe
not
includ
iran
or
russia
and
china
the
other
parti
to
the

it
seek
to
spell
out
to

that
europ
will
seek
to
contain

and
sunset
claus
under
which
some
of
it
term
expir
while
the
european
and
the
american
have
narrow
their
differ
they
are
struggl
to
agre
on
how
to
handl
a
desir
to
extend
some
of
the
limit
on
iran
s
nuclear
programm
without
reopen
the
juli
accord
we
re
tri
to
find
the
right
formula
that
respond
to
the
expect
of
the
american
but
at
the
same
time
do
not
go
against
the
deal
said
a
second
senior
european
diplomat
there
is
a
chanc
of
get
an
agreement
but
even
if
we
have
we
one
i
m
not
convinc
that
it
will
be
enough
to
stop
the
withdraw
the
diplomat
said
in
their
packag
for
trump
the
european
are
also
grappl
with
a
desir
to
make
explicit
that
iran
must
give
intern
inspector
access
to
militari
site
the
european
say
thi
is
alreadi
implicit
in
the
origin
deal
there
s
a
view
that
the
inspect
provis
aren
t
strong
enough
which
is
not
a
view
that
is
share
by
the
european

franc

emmanuel

that
irrespect
of

there
should
be
a
wider

a
grand
bargain
that
would
incorpor
the

and
the

it
is

these
are
good
