china
s
record
import
of
crude
oil
in
octob
are
without
a
doubt
a
bullish
outcom
but
within
the
broader
pattern
of
grow
demand
there
were
some
temporari
factor
lift
purchas
china
import
million
tonn
of
crude
in
octob
equival
to
million
barrel
per
day
bpd
a
figur
that
beat
the
previou
record
of

from
april
import
jump
a
massiv
percent
from
the
same
month
a
year
earlier
and
also
by
percent
from
septemb
accord
to
custom
data
it
s
probabl
worth
tri
to
split
the
underli
trend
in
china
s
oil
import
from
the
factor
that
can
caus
outcom
such
as
octob
s
record
the

still
one
of

it

also

in
the

quarter
of

compar

a

china
is
also
still
some
way
from

disclos
how

it
is
direct

although
variou
energi
analyst
believ
it
is
in
the
region
of
bpd
against
thi
backdrop
of
solid
underli
demand
growth
octob
ad
a
coupl
of
factor
that
are
unlik
to
be
perman
the
first
is
that
smaller
independ
refin
were
activ
in
the
month
buy
almost
million
bpd
which
is
a
record
high
accord
to
data
from
refinitiv
oil
research
and
forecast
the
independ
were
like
buy
crude
to
use
up
their
import
quota
befor
they
expir
rais
the
possibl
that
demand
from
thi
sector
will
moder
a
touch
in
come
month
there
also
seem
to
be
a
bit
of
rush
to
buy
iranian
crude
befor
the
resumpt
of
sanction
against
the
islam
republ
s
export
import
from
iran
were
bpd
in
octob
accord
to
refinitiv
data
which
wa
percent
higher
than
septemb
s
bpd
the
abov
number
come
with
a
caveat
insofar
as
it
s
becom
harder
to
track
iranian
export
as
the
countri
s
tanker
have
start
disabl
their
system
it
may
have
been
the
case
that
chines
import
were
stock
up
on
iranian
crude
ahead
of
the
renew
sanction
thi
rais
the
possibl
that
china
may
wind
back
purchas
in
come
month
especi
sinc
the
administr
of
presid
donald
trump
decid
to
grant
waiver
to
eight
buyer
of
iranian
crude
includ
top
purchas
china
and
india
for
a
period
of
six
month
it
s
also
worth
note
that
china
s
export
of
refin
product
were
onli
slightli
weaker
in
octob
than
in
septemb
with
million
tonn
be
ship
down
from
million
thi
equat
to
about
million
bpd
of
product
export
with
chines
refin
like
to
be
keen
to
sell
into
the
strong
region
market
for
middl
distil
such
as
diesel
and
jet
fuel
where
the
profit
margin
are
at
or
close
to
high
china
s
product
export
are
up
percent
in
the
first
month
of
the
year
compar
to
the
same
period
last
year
overal
the
pictur
that
emerg
is
that
china
s
appetit
for
import
crude
oil
remain
strong
and
grow
and
octob
s
record
while
boost
by
temporari
factor
is
unlik
to
last
for
too
long
given
the
robust
fundament
the
opinion
express
here
are
those
