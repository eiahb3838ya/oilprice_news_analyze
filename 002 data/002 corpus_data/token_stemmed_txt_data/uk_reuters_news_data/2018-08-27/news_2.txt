one
of

is
that
export
of
crude
oil
to
the
world
s
biggest
import
are
now
view
through
the
prism
of
polit
howev
thi
ignor
that
buyer
and
seller
of
crude
are
gener
more
motiv
by
profit
margin
and
get
the
right
grade
of
oil
to
maximis
the
product
of
their
plant
while
it
s
true
they
can
t
disregard
polit
and
thi
is
especi
the
case
for
the
chines
major
it
s
worth
look
at
the

as
well
crude

appear
set

the

s
import
of

ha
coincid
with

that

list
of

to
be
hit
with

that
hasn
t
happen
yet
although
it
would
have

understand
for

to
be
wari
of

in

howev
the

close

that
chines

could
buy

the
