also
said
it
appear
the

as
they
are

at

in

earlier
thi

it
may
well
be
the
first
sign
of
a
major
thaw
between
the
two
administr
and
it
may
even
herald
the
start
of
posit
move
toward
some
kind
of
settlement
that
would
see
no
more
tariff
be
impos
and
perhap
even
the
remov
of
the
one
alreadi
implement
but
it
s
also
worth
put
thing
in
context
china
use
to
be
the
biggest
buyer
of

take
about
percent
of
export
in
worth
an
estim

howev
sinc
beij
slap
a

on

import
from
the

the

ha
fallen
away
with

of
the

down
from

last

what
thi
show
is
that
china
would
have
to
dramat
boost
it
buy
from
the
unit
state
to
return
to
former
level
which
make
the
recent
purchas
a
spit
in
the
bucket
it
s
also
like
that
china
find
it
conveni
to
go
back
to
the
market
at
the
present
time
given
the
crop
is
readi
for

while
that
from

thi
mean
there
is
a

element
to

and
the
chines

may
have
had
littl
choic

to
resum

they
have
done
so
in
a
way
that

what
would
be
