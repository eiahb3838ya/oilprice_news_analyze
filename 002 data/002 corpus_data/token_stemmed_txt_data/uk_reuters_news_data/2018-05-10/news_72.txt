they
expect
thi
happi

it
wa
a
challeng

pessimist
about
the

at

thi
wa
in
stark
contrast
to
the

confer
in

where
the
mood

in
the
two
biggest
import
china
and
india
certainli
it
would
seem
that
the

ha
some
reason
to
be
optimist
with
chines
import
up
percent
in
the
first
four
month
of
the

and
hope
that

up
from

and
percent
higher
than
the

for
of
in
may
of
that
year
the
main
driver
of
coal
s
improv
perform
is
chines

with

report
buy
interest
from
china
for
a
varieti
of
coal
grade
from

coal
from

the
bullish
chines

may
have
taken
a
slight
hit
in
the
april
number
with
custom

show
coal
import
drop
to

a
gain
of

over

record
in
the

period
last

although
both

have
shown
onli

so

thi

thi
is
stoke
optim
in

especi
when
ad
to
addit
emerg
demand
from
other
asian
countri
such

but
while
there
may
be

to
be

on

the
trend
doe

it

toward

over

in

the
main
constraint
on

is

the

also
tend

the
idea
that

may
halt

or
forc
cutback
in

consumpt
seem
alien
to

in

despit
evid
that
thi
is
exactli
what
is
happen
in

and
ha
alreadi

how
they
were
go
to
have

clear
in

look
to
boost
the

it
s
almost
inevit
that
similar
pressur
will
emerg
in
india
and
ani
other
countri
that
decid
to
make
coal
it
main
sourc
of
power
while
the
coal

enjoy
someth
