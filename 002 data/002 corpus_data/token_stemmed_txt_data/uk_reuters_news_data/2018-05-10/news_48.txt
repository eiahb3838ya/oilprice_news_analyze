iraq
is

the

worri
they

said
one
senior
western
envoy
if
there
is
a
war
between
iran

the

part
of

and
iran
had
found
a

which
at
one
point
held
about
a
third
of
iraq
mainli
in

it

decis
hasti
and
rash
and
said
washington

in

which
would
bring
noth
but

and
the
desol
of

in
the
scenario
diplomat
in
the
region
said
iran
would
target
interest
in
iraq
as
their
militia
did
in
by
fire
rocket
into
the
embassi
in
baghdad
but
iran
might
prefer
to
steer
clear
of
iraq
and
use
syria
instead
iraq
s
shi
ite
leader
nonetheless
face
a
dilemma
about
how
to
balanc
polici
between
the
unit
state
and
iran
some
iraqi
leader
among
them
abadi
say
they
want
to
steer
clear
of
rivalri
they
would
want
to
follow
the
model
of
polici
friend
of
all
said
anoth
western
diplomat
other
includ
amiri
believ
that
iraq
s
singl
most
import
relationship
is
with
iran
and
that
they
have
to
reinforc
that
relationship
also
import
to
iraq
is
build
bridg
with
the
minor
sunni
commun
although
some
politician
are
wari
of
abadi
s
tent
rapproch
with
sunni
saudi
arabia
nurtur
after
decad
of
estrang
their
greatest
nightmar
is
to
wake
up
and
have
the
sunni
or
arab
undermin
their
ascend
and
domin
in
the
system
as
happen
with
daesh
said
the
second
western
diplomat
refer
to
islam
state
s
advanc
in
they
are
remind
that
iran
will
be
their
ultim
resort
when

do
not
want
to
be
domin
by
iran
but
trump
s
move
thi
week
against
tehran
may
make
that
harder
after
trump
s

the
question
is
how
do
you
implement
a
balanc
polici
when
iran
will
use
iraq

what
will
they
do
said
the
