the
uae
is
no
except
he

nor
for
that

is
the

the

is
a
major

commod
it
point
out
and
the
consequ
of
climat
chang
includ
hotter
weather
could
affect
those
facil
ani
result
food
price
spike
would
hurt
the
poorest
the
most
and
that
could
drive
a
need
for

subsidi
there
are
other
factor
too
not

water
the
uae
s
agricultur
sector
account
for
just

the
report
note
yet
use
about

vastli
disproportion
to

contribut
said

a

given
that

and
given
that
regular
farmer
benefit
from

al
jundi
of
badia
farm
said
end
such
break
would
make
vertic
farm
a
cheaper
solut
the
money
spent
on

vertic
farm
is
rel
much
lower
than
of
the

said
al

it
is
work
with
the

on
a
shift
to
renew
energi
the
impact
one
vertic
farm
can
have
though
is
limit
and
will
be
felt
onli
on
the
margin
it
will
not
chang
the

relianc
on

for
