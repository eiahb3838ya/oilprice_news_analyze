china
s
new
crude
futur
contract
face
a
mountain
of
obstacl
to
overcom
if
it
is
to
establish
itself
as
a
viabl
benchmark
for
trade
with
the
world
s
largest
oil
import
the
shanghai
intern
energi
exchang
ine
which
is
part
of
the
shanghai
futur
exchang
said
on
it
would
launch
the
contract
on
march
in
theori
thi
will
give
china
a
power
tool
to
shake
up
global
crude
trade
by
offer
price
and
hedg
in
the
heart
of
the
world
s
biggest
market
for
import
crude
the
realiti
is
like
to
be
somewhat
differ
with
potenti
market
particip
like
to
be
cautiou
until
they
see
how
the
variou
dynam
play
out
some
of
the
issu
that
will
need
to
be
address
are
how
liquid
will
the
contract
be
given
the
limit
number
of
potenti
buyer
for
physic
deliveri
at
the
bond
storag
in
china
how
much
govern
intervent
is
like
given
beij
s
penchant
for
adjust
rule
and
regul
to
influenc
price
if
the
market
move
in
a
direct
deem
undesir
will
trader
be
happi
to
work
in
a
contract
with
the
associ
currenc
risk
and
convert
issu
will
trade
in
the
new
contract
be
domin
by
the
chines
major
to
the
exclus
of
opportun
for
other
given
the
contract
is
deliver
in
china
how
will
the
inclus
of
freight
cost
affect
trade
but
perhap
the
biggest
challeng
face
the
ine
contract
is
the
fact
that
it
is
effect
base
in
a
demand
centr
rather
than
a
product
centr
as
are
the
other
major
oil
futur
the
three
main
exist
benchmark
brent
west
texa
intermedi
and
the
dubai
mercantil
exchang
s
dme
oman
are
base
in
product
centr
and
the
deliveri
point
are
close
to
where
the
oil
is
actual
pump
it
s
actual
difficult
to
find
futur
in
the
commod
world
that
are
base
in
a
demand
centr
with
most
success
contract
be
set
up
near
point
of
suppli
a
system
that
ha
allow
produc
trader
and
consum
to
hedg
risk
and
discov
price
the
ine
contract
will
be
pioneer
a
differ
type
of
futur
with
the
specif
show
that
each
contract
will
be
for
a
volum
of
barrel
and
the
deliver
crude
be
a
mix
of
tradabl
middl
eastern
grade
as
well
as
shengli
a
domest
crude
the
ine
ha
approv
six
bond
storag
site
at
eight
locat
in
china
with
a
total
usabl
capac
of
million
barrel
it
appear
that
the
contract
ha
been
and
there
is
littl
to
fault
from
a
technic
perspect
but
thi
alon
is
unlik
to
be
enough
to
guarante
success
the
per
lot
and
the
minimum
transact
margin
of
percent
of
contract
valu
are
probabl
larg
enough
to
deter
day
trader
and
specul
howev
thi
is
a
sword
as
it
will
limit
liquid
and
volatil
two
thing
that
can
be
attract
to
trader
some
of
china
s
most
success
commod
futur
contract
such
as
iron
ore
on
the
dalian
commod
exchang
are
domin
by
day
trader
with
the
volum
they
bring
help
establish
the
deriv
as
import
region
price
indic
overcom
the
trust
deficit
between
foreign
market
particip
and
the
chines
author
also
loom
larg
and
it
s
like
that
mani
potenti
player
will
be
keen
for
the
ine
to
establish
a
track
record
befor
they
becom
involv
anoth
risk
for
the
new
contract
is
that
the
chines
author
want
it
to
succeed
so
much
that
they
effect
forc
major
and
even
smaller
independ
chines
refin
to
use
the
ine
thi
could
well
boost
volum
and
give
the
contract
the
semblanc
of
success
but
it
would
be
artifici
and
thu
probabl
not
as
effect
as
it
could
be
as
a
hedg
tool
there
is
littl
doubt
that
china
is
seek
to
play
a
bigger
role
in
global
crude
trade
a
reason
ambit
given
it
ha
overtaken
the
unit
state
as
the
world
s
biggest
buyer
howev
establish
a
new
price
benchmark
is
extrem
difficult
as
the
dme
can
tell
you
from
their
experi
in
tri
to
build
the
oman
futur
as
the
main
middl
east
marker
despit
it
be
a
contract
with
arguabl
better
technic
specif
than
both
brent
and
wti
the
ine
deserv
a
shot
at
success
and
ultim
it
make
far
more
sens
to
have
a
price
benchmark
for
asia
base
in
the
region
s
top
consum
rather
than
use
contract
that
reflect
a
