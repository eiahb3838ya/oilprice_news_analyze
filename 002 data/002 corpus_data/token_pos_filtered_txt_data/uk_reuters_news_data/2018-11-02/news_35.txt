south
african
researchers
say
they
have
made
bricks
using
human
urine
natural
process
involving
colonies
bacteria
which
one
day
help
reduce
global
warming
emissions
finding
productive
use
ultimate
waste
product
grey
bricks
are
produced
lab
eight
days
using
urine
calcium
sand
bacteria
fertilizers
are
also
produced
processes
bricks
do
not
smell
bricks
are
made
using
urea
chemical
found
naturally
urine
also
synthesized
world
make
fertilizer
process
growing
bricks
urea
has
been
tested
united
states
synthetic
solutions
new
brick
uses
real
human
urine
first
time
researchers
said
we
literally
pee
away
day
flush
it
sewer
networks
said
dyllon
randall
senior
lecturer
university
cape
town
s
civil
engineering
department
is
part
team
that
developed
brick
why
not
recover
instead
make
multiple
products
are
created
process
called
microbial
induced
carbonate
precipitation
which
is
similar
process
that
naturally
produces
coral
reefs
loose
sand
is
colonized
bacteria
that
produce
enzyme
urease
enzyme
breaks
urea
urine
producing
rocky
substance
calcium
carbonate
complex
chemical
reaction
brick
column
shape
be
made
bricks
are
formed
room
temperature
cutting
harmful
carbon
dioxide
emitted
when
making
regular
bricks
that
are
one
obstacle
preventing
mass
production
bricks
use
huge
amounts
pee
make
single
brick
requires
liters
urine
couple
weeks
wee
typical
adult
so
i
get
it
boys
bathroom
laboratory
i
put
little
sign
up
university
boys
contribute
research
said
suzanne
lambert
proved
concept
research
making
first
brick
i
definitely
see
commercialization
next
decade
two
is
still
lot
lab
work
be
done
