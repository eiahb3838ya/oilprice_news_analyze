agreement
saudi

was
regularly
exporting

bpd
it
s
also
worth
noting
only
two
months
january

did

shows
is

it
s
interesting
note
saudis
have
been
somewhat
vague
when
it
comes
saying
exactly
how
much
more
they
produce

it
becomes
more
important

us
back
burning
question

how
much

is
certainly
risk
relying
