are
three
basic
ways
physical
volume
nuclear
waste
be
reduced
which
are
costly
least
one
techniques
poses
security
threat
they
said
first
called
consolidation
reduces
volume
nuclear
waste
taking
apart
spent
fuel
assemblies
crunching
waste
down
two
times
smaller
original
volume
approach
that
is
considered
costly
which
doesn
t
add
much
security
risk
second
technique
involves
heating
radioactive
pellets
spent
fuel
assemblies
process
which
gives
gases
that
be
contained
results
waste
product
that
has
more
environmental
health
risks
third
approach
called
pyroprocessing
