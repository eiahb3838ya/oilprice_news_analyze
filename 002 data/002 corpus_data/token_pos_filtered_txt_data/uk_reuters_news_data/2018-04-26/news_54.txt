ways
decline
coking

imports
isn

surprising
given

fact
march
s
production
million

was
most
september
according
data
national

is
likely
explanation
is
steel

was
curbed
north

acute

good

higher
steel
output
first
quarter
doesn
t
fit
well
lower
imports
coking
coal
are
factors
that
help
explain
issues
first
is
steel
mills
have
been
using
higher
quality
iron
therefore
requiring
less
coking
coal
produce
same
amount
raw
material
certainly
recent
months
have
seen
widening
premiums
iron
ore
traders
have
reported
mills
have
been
preferring

probably
isn
t
enough
itself
explain
lower
coking
coal
imports
it
s
doubtful
domestic
production
has
been
making
shortfall
china
s
total
coal
production
including
thermal
coking
grades
fell
lowest
five
months
march
totalling

was
up

suggesting
anything
was
only
modest
increase
domestic
