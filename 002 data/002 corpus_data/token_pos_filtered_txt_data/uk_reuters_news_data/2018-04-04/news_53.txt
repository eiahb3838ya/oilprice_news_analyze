it
s
somewhat
unrealistic
expect
it
already
be
major
factor
driving
bri
investment
it

it
also

that
virtually

exception

bri
helps
make
it
look
bri
is
something
significant
rather
collection
unrelated
projects
being
undertaken
separate
companies
little
coordination
however
just
bri
seems
somewhat
haphazard
right
now
doesn
t
mean
it
remain
way
it
be
great
project
century
it
be
nothing
you
have
be
involved
matter
is
how
one
investor
put

commodity
producers
takeaway
is
chinese
are
increasingly
interested
developing
resources
they
believe
meet
domestic
needs
bri
include
battery
metals
such
cobalt
lithium
nickel
also

bri
is
indeed

beijing
