opec
s
production
policy
leadership
saudi

has
alternated
supporting
prices
defending

opec
like

again
opec
policy
is
cyclical
so
point
focus
revert
market
share
when
loss
customers
becomes
too
painful
are
several
reasons
think
switch
be
delayed
time
opec
has
always
been
slow
react
changing
market
conditions
previous
price
slumps
organisation
allowed
market
tighten
too
much
rather
risk
not
tightening
it
enough
allowing
prices
rise
too
far
too
long
opec
has
normally
created
conditions
next
downturn
moment
however
current
strategy
is
still
paying
dividends
organisation
s
members
including
saudi
arabia
higher
prices
are
more
offsetting
loss
sales
volumes
so
is
pressure
switch
course
more
importantly
kingdom
seems
want
high
rising
oil

provide

allow

much
