when

customers
becomes

painful
are
several
reasons

opec

been
slow

allowed

risk
not
tightening
it
enough
allowing

too

opec
has

created

moment
however
current
strategy
is
still
paying
dividends
organisation
s
members
including
saudi
arabia
higher
prices
are
more
offsetting
loss
sales
volumes
so
is
pressure
switch
course
more
