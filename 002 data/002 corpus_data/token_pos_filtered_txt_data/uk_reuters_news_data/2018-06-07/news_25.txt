firstly
it

coming
i
think
we
have
optimal
make

beautiful
sport
here
is
massive
it
s
millions
we
rely
fact
soccer
team
score
big
win
so
speak
show
best
is
method
which
restrain
russia
notorious
sanctions
endless
accusations
lay
groundwork
introducing
restraining
it
is
russia
is
seen
threat
russia
is
seen
becoming
competitor
i
believe
approach
is
mistaken
instead
restraining
it
be
better
establish
constructive
cooperation
then
overall
effect
global
economy
be
it
is
clear
us
we
have
defend
interests
do
so
consistently
not
boorishly
rudely
sphere
economy
defence
we
have
done
so
we
continue
do
so
we
always
look
compromises
we
aspire
towards
compromises
pressure
end
when
partners
be
persuaded
methods
they
are
using
are
ineffective
counterproductive
harmful
understanding
third
world
war
be
end
civilisation
restrain
us
taking
extreme
steps
international
arena
that
are
highly
dangerous
modern
threat
mutual
destruction
has
always
restrained
participants
international
arena
prevented
leading
military
powers
making
hasty
moves
compelled
participants
respect
other
withdrawal
treaties
missiles
is
attempt
put
end
strategic
parity
we
respond
we
believe
unilateral
introduction
kinds
sanctions
does
not
resolve
problems
it
only
worsens
when
it
comes
position
compatriots
countries
baltic
we
are
constantly
talking
bringing
it
attention
governments
baltic
states
including
measures
we
take
protect

be
such
they
do
not
actually
worsen
is
important

visiting
just
now
representatives
many
other
european
countries
let
alone
asia
they
don
t
just
say
privately
now
they
are
talking
it
appears
partners
thought
never
affect
them
counterproductive
politics
restrictions
sanctions
now
we
are
seeing
is
introduction
example
restrictive
tariffs
steel
aluminium
not

same
time
i
also
worked
security
services

easiest
ban
harder
find
civilised
solutions
therefore
i
m
going
urge
colleagues
take
route
route
security
law
enforcement
agencies
using
modern
methods
combat
offences
including
terrorism
restricting
freedoms
including
we
need
take
many
steps
forward
including
quality
satellites
quality
equipment
we
return
maintain

s
lot
competition
overall
general
we
have
big
very
ambitious

largely
done
mutko
i
understand

s
just
impossible
send

has
lot
potential
let
him
recently
one
germany
s
famous
popular
publications
wrote

pushing
europe
towards
putin
we
take
together
earlier
