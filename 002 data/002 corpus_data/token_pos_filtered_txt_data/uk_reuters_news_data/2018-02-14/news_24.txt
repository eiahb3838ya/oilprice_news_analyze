sense

critical

is
how
when

is

point
opec

only

is
when
opec

probably
adjust

point
include

aim
defending

triggering
steep

challenge
is
get

is
absorbing
growing
consumption
experience
suggests
opec
leave
adjustment
too
late
tighten

too

send

then
increase

moment
when

opec
allowed

that
