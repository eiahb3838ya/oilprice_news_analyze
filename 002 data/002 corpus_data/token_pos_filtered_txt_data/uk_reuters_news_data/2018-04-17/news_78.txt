however
growth
rate
first

meaning
china
s
imports
crude

are
still
increasing
they
aren

doing

last

imports
unwrought
copper
increasing

picture
that
emerges
china

trade
data
is
somewhat
similar

is
little
suggest
china

is
slowing
faster
expected
data
show
commodity
imports
are
still
relatively
robust
even
pace
growth
is
slowing
it
s
likely
healthy

is
best
outcome
china
