controversy
gates
said
were
understandable
concerns
safety

that
need
be

research

he
countered
malaria
itself
is
quite
controversial
it
kills
kids

we

them
getting

is
worth

told

almost

global
efforts
beat

had
been

ending

good
take

next

he
said
he
thought
it
unlikely

he
said
it
evolve
back
evolutionary
pressures
always
push
dramatically
reducing
mosquito
populations
such
technologies
however
give

he
said

also
said
