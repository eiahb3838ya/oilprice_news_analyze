means
asian

are
making

producing

barely
scraping
gasoline
however
strong
profits
fuels
mean
refiners
are
still
incentivised
maximise
crude
throughput
that
means
they
continue
produce
large
volumes
gasoline
even
it
s
hardly
worth
do
so
how
does
trump
fit

main

are

dropping

when

lower
diesel

it
s
also
worth

asian

are
finding
it

indications
are
it
