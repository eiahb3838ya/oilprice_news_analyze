facts
seem
contradictory
are
several
issues
help
explain

perhaps
most
compelling
is
china
appears
be
becoming
more
attuned

refined

asia
is
often

china
s

exports
refined
products
data
is
incomplete
case
main
missing
numbers
are
movements
inventories
inventory
data
was
last
released

it
s
hard
know
how
much

gasoline

exports
have
been

chinese
refiners
getting
close
exhausting

cutting

it
is
also
possible
smaller
independent
refineries
exported
less
reduced
runs
they
battle
higher
crude

increased
government
scrutiny
taxes
chinese
domestic
consumption
also
have
risen
especially
agricultural
sector
given
summer
peak

season
factors
help
shed
light
china
s
exports
refined

perhaps
best
explanation
is
movement
prices
time
when
july
exports
have
been
arranged
profit

crude
main
regional
benchmark
dropped

july
it
had
been
steadily
declining
hitting
peak

meaning
time
chinese
refiners
have
been
contemplating
selling

incentive
do
so
was

moves
pricing
suggest
chinese
refiners
have
become
more
price
sensitive
therefore
less
likely

fuels
irrespective
profit
gained
doing
so
is
also
worth
noting
is

are
indeed
becoming
more
other
factors
still
play
bigger
role
