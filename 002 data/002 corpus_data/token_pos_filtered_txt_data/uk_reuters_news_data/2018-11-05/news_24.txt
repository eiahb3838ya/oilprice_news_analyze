then
it
go

very

floating

coastal

are
fast
gaining
popularity
particularly

experts

now

china

get
biggest
problems
facing
traditional

pakistan

talking
using
floating

karachi

he

china
currently
has
most
gigawatts

installed
according

is

bigger

knight

backers
say
environmental

india
s
mishra
now
attention
has
be
more
challenging
is
keeping

colonising

corrosively
salty
coastal
installations
which
account
relatively
small

so
far
noted

he
said
he
expects
technology
draw
more
investment
when
durability
reliability
has
been
proven
real
world
installations
currently
floating
solar
arrays
cost
percent
more

knight
said
cost
is
often
offset
other
lower
costs
many
places
one
has
pay

people
preparing

building
roads
he
said
floating
solar
you
avoid
quite
bit
solar
panels
used
water
which
cools
them
also
produce
percent
more
electricity
he
said
mishra
said
view
india
has
sufficient
land
traditional
solar
installations
much
it
is
remote
areas
inhospitable
agriculture
including
deserts
putting
solar
panels
water
comparison
cuts
transmission
costs
moving
power
generation
closer
people
need
energy
he
said
he
said
india
already
makes
solar
panels
it
needs
is
now
setting
manufacturing
floats
anchors
needed
floating
solar
systems
when
capacity
is
place
then
cost
automatically
come
