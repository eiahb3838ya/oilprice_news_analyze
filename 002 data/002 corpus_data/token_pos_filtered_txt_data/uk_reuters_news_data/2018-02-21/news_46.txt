decimated

rome

britain
germany

experienced
severe
flooding
recent

paris
was
forced

last

is

drought
now
threatening
water
supplies
cape
town
is
stark
example
how
cities
need
adapt
long
drought
flood
hits
once
drought
kicks
water
starts
run

it

dawson
said
heatwaves
floods
pose
similar
problems
so
you
have
really
start
thinking
longterm
terms
preparing
adapting
cities
sort
climate
event
he
told
thomson
reuters
foundation
cities
build
large
infrastructure
such
reservoirs
flood
barriers
make
smaller
incremental
changes
repeatedly
he
said
buildings
also
be
designed
be
naturally
cooler
use
less
water
be
more
resilient
flooding
people
too
change
behaviour
use
less
water
he
said
combination
things
is
probably
best
way
adapt
dawson
said
city
reduce
need
water
exposure
climate
risks
cutting
number
people
living
flood
plains
example
then
overall
vulnerability
goes
down
he
said
we
make
buildings
more
resilient
floods
heat
more
effective
using
water
resources
then
we
create
more
headroom
adaptation
more
extreme
events
