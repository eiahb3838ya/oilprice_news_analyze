churchill
suggested
start
producing

animals
well
starters
raising
farm
animals
takes
vast
resources
put

estimated
clean

fewer

conventional
beef
production
such
early
studies
are
admittedly
imprecise
technologies
that
make
clean
meat
commercially
viable
are
still
development
most
analysts
believe
even
production
meat
is
likely
be
far
more
traditional
livestock
production
churchill
s
vision
synthetic
meat
isn
t
yet

it
s
likely

years

not

meats
are
already

ourselves
factory
farming

worry
that
churchill
s
vision
meat
animals
is
unnatural
find
it
helpful
recall
just
how
unsustainable
inhumane
unnatural
contemporary
meat
production
has
become
clean
meat
probably
won
t
be
competing

share
meat
animals
rather
clean
meat
enthusiasts
seek
displace
farm
animals
providing
vast
majority
meat
we
eat
today
animals
that
languish
own
feces
never
set
foot
outdoors
are
forced
consume
large
quantities
antibiotics
other
drugs
we
pause
contemplate
harsh
reality
promise
clean
meat
seems
obvious
churchill
had
lot

when
he
became
prime
minister
yet
predictions
contents

have
even
greater
relevance
today
we
search
ways
reduce
harm
we
re
doing

we
have
clean

soon
prove

part
