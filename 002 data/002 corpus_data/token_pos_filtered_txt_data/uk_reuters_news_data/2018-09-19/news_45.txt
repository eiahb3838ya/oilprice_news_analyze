when
owners
norwegian
oil
firm
aker
bp
decided
digitize
assets
operations
they
searched
high
low
right
software
company
they
failed
find
suitable
one
so
instead
they
set
own
cognite
create
digital

cognite
says
software
help
reduce
maintenance
costs
extend
lifespan
equipment
avoid

digitizing
industrial

also
mean
fewer

need
be
offshore
less

now
things
are
happening
so
quickly
it
seem
counterintuitive
share
technological
expertise
rivals
learning
usage
companies
industries
software
be
improved
even
oilfield
specific
data
is
exchanged
improvements
then
be
rolled
clients
including
aker
bp
provide
algorithm
software
be
able
map
connect
sensors
right
equipment
that
s
big
challenge
oil
companies
also
other

have

we
work
create
