it
was
very
much
advertised
lot
people
were
it
became
clear
today
that
is
not
case
he
s
very
focused
oil

regime
are
other
sanctions
that
go
effect
well
i
think
he
spelled
remarks
as
well
he
indicated
speech
that
countries
that
do

iran
also
be
subject

china
dealing
different

market
direction

was
going
you
have
seem
modest
flight
quality
it
hasn
t
been
major
i
think
right
now
s
still
quite
bit
uncertainty
future
deal
even
now
has
made
intentions
clear
we
do
know
european
union
has
said
they
continue
uphold
accord
regardless
decision
we
need
know
how
iran
respond
s
still
plenty
air
you
argue
president
trump
being
open
negotiation
better
deal
also
hanging
risk
sanctions
iran
agreement
still
be
reached
risky
scenario
be

toronto
energy

trump
announced
everything
one
possibly
have
wanted
him
say
term
he
used
was
highest
level
sanctions
we
re
obviously
looking
detail
it
gives
one
confidence
be
reduction
physical
movement
barrels
also
puts
stake
growth
ambitions
iran
grow
production
capacity
today
s
announcement
gives
energy
bulls
that
much
more
confidence
bull
market
oil
has
even
greater
longevity
it
i
think
we
re
going
next

wti
we
see
inventories
reaching

is
really
telegraphed
policy
position
i
don

think
market
is
surprised
economic

be
minimal
really
is
political
story
it
s
not
markets
economic
investors
are
also
reacting
trump
s
tone
he
s
not
closed
door
shunned
them
he
wants
new
deal
door
is
open
try
again
which
is
probably
less
harsh
he
have
michael

was
so
much
leaked
there
media
it
doesn
t
seem
be
much
surprise
market
initial
reaction
was
defense
names
popped
rallied
oil
had
rallied
they
re
giving
back
now
as
well
we
haven
t
moved

i
think
people
are
sorting
actually
happen
is
there
actually
oil
that
s
going
leave
market
it
doesn
t
appear
so
you
take
look
s
going
now
iran
ships
million
barrels
day
asia
oil
is
unlikely
get
changed
buyers
which
are
mainly
china
india
korea
are
unlikely
adjust
plans
piece
that
come
play
is
goes
europe
barrels
day
goes
europe
it
depends
level
europe
is
cooperating
trump
one
important
thing
oil
iran
is
very
different
oil
venezuela
one
issues
venezuela
has
is
oil
is
very
heavy
sour
so
not
many
refiners
world
actually
process
it
example
stops
importing
oil
venezuela
it
s
little
more
difficult
find
home
it
whereas
oil
iran
is
medium
quality
so
there
s
lot
more
places
it
you
look
back
last
time
sanctions
came
effect
asian
buyers
did
not
cut
back
purchases
so
now
s
something
that
is
unlikely
occur
s
definitely
lot
little
ins
outs
that
try
steer
things
direction
terms
cargoes
be
insured
s
lot
pieces
puzzle
i
not
sure
when
exactly
is
going
be
put
it
doesn
t
seem
s
going
be

big
risk
is
crude
spike
which
trump
doesn

want
ahead
midterms
does
trump
really
want
political

point
view
so
does
he
bark
then
walk
it
back
oil
prices
go
too
high
secondary
impact
is
it
