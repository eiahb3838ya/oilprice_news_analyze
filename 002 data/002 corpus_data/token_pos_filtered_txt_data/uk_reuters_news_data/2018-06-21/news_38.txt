good
target
organization

week
are
highlights
falih
s
speech
opec
seminar
strikes
me
most
is
great
alignment
very
strong
alignment
interests
producers
consumers
many
people
underestimate
how
much
alignment
interests
is
producers
consumers
we
ve
seen
investments
start
flowing
back
certainly
it
s
flowing
back
united
states
oil
shale
we
still
want
more
investment
concern
is
really
be
able
look
forward
terms
five
years
future
see
enough
projects
coming
back
we
want
prevent
shortage
squeeze
we
saw

opec
secretariat
share
us
today
joint
ministerial
monitoring
committee
report
i
ve
looked
report
flying
i
think
it
shows
be
deficit
second
half
year
million
barrels
assuming
main
production
continues
that
continue
drive
inventories
we
think
be
probably
too
short
supply
situation
we
not
allow
it
happen
so
level
supply
release
we
have
come
end
day
first
foremost
responsibility
is
consumers
how
much
do
we
distribute
countries
how
much
it
actually
is
delivered
i
think
is
debate
next
couple
one
thing
you
be
assured
is
we
be
responsible
we
release
supplies
make
sure
shortage
coming
close
even
million
cut
is
called
fundamentals
how
achieve
it
is
tricky
question
not
country
respond
allocation
higher
production
reallocating
output
other
countries
saudi
arabia
be
technical
solution
it
not
be
politically
acceptable
i
speak
saudi
arabia
we
do
have
couple
million
barrels
spare
capacity
how
much
oil
do
we
need
it
s
not
going
be
anything
close
level
volumes
million
probably
given
fact
we
see
demand
second
half
rise
significantly
first
half
i
think
million
sounds
me
be
good
target
work
mid
long
term
we
are
concerned
global
trade
global
economic
growth
obviously
when
major
economies
clash
it
s
difficult
me
see
we
re
going
see
significant
drop
demand
next
months
