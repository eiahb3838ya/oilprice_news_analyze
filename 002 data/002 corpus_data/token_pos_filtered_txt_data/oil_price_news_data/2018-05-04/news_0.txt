only
he
s
got
right

trade
making
speculative
trade
hedge

continues
be
almost
uniformly
long
fact
that
used

me
much
more

appear
more
often
more

mentioned
refiners
choice

use
last
several
months
when
it
seemed
s
were
lagging
so
using
refiners
holding
zone
capital
was
useful
way
keep
capital
active
hardly
took
advantage
amazing
move
that
refiners
have
continued
have
last
two
years
i
have
argued
refiners
other
times
have
abandoned
them
last
months
have
missed
massive
move
bad
i
had
seen
advantages

while
refiners
have
done
tremendous
job
leveraging
