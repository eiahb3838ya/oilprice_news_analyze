canadian heavy crude producers find new ways to ship oil

they
are

kevin

reported
earlier
week
that
meg

was
working
commercializing
proprietary

pipeline
technology
described
orland
involves
process
that
entails
removing

heavier
portions
bitumen
then
removing

known
meg
is
not
alone
push
cenovus
energy
husky
energy
are
also
testing
own
methods
reducing
diluent
demand
they
have
good
reason
diluents
are
typically
light
crude
fractions
light
fractions
are
expensive
s
just

are

pipeline

is

canadian

accidentally
discovered

that
