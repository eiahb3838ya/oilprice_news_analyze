the u.s. oil production “mirage”

past
spring
have
been
july
eia
released
monthly
data
oil
production
which
revealed
decline
output
bpd
compared
month
earlier
dip
is
surprise
given
widespread
assumption
shale
production
was
continuing
grow
blistering
be
sure
big
reason
decline
overall

rose
disappointing
figure
that

came

most

million

is

lower
eia
itself
thought
time
here
are
weekly
estimates
oil

put
back

april
weekly
estimates
tend
be
less
accurate
retrospective
monthly
numbers
that
is
not
new
dynamic
estimating
weekly
basis
inherently
involves
lot
guesswork
is
not
knock
discrepancy
is
rather
striking
not
only
did
eia
estimate
that
production
april
was
much
higher
it
actually
was
agency
also
thought
production
was
rising
weekly
estimates
were
be
believed
time
production
have
climbed
early
april
end
increase
bpd
roughly
only
was
production
lower
it
didn
t
actually
increase
eia
s
more
accurate
monthly
figures
show
slight
decline
output
falling
april
just
weekly
data
had
shown
strong
output
rise
march
revised
data
shows
rise
was
mirage
output
actually
fell

july
high
judging
monthly

april
perhaps
agency
is
also
overstating
july
figures
which
raises
possibility
production
is
not
nearly
as
high
we
currently
coming
months
monthly
production
figures
continue
show
output
undershooting

that

most

tighter
