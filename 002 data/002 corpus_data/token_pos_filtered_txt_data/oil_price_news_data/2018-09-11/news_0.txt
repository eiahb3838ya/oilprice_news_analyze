can oil demand really peak within 5 years?

according

timing
peak
is
actually
pretty
important
even
complete

is

off

peak
occurs
early
transition
carbon
tracker
argues
looking
past
technology
transitions
peak
demand
tends
occur
when
upstart
technologies
capture
only
percent
importantly
period
peak
is
when
incumbents
start
suffer
disruption
incumbents
are

misses
importance
hitting
peak
real
pain
fossil
fuel
industry
comes
much
sooner
once
peak
is
hit
troubles
start
accelerate
demand
starts
fall
so
fossil
fuel
companies
face
lower
prices
products
lower
valuations
ultimately
stranded
assets
we
then
expect
major
reallocation
capital
bankruptcy
companies
that
are
unprepared
sector

prepared

take

that

not
carbon
tracker
are
not
going

complete

fossil

they
start

capital
shun

investments
that

occurs
much
sooner
arguably
coal

is
