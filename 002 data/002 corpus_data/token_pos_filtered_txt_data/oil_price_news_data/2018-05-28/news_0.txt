discounts
magnitude
are
pretty
rare
particularly
began
exporting
crude
oil
several
years
ago
is
aspect
price
differentials
wti
falls
significantly
lower
brent
then
american
crude
oil
becomes

foreign
buyers
refiners

many
cargoes
possible
removing

while

time
loosening

result
is
is
pressure
two
benchmarks
converge
once
saw
play
last
year
devastation
hurricane
harvey
which
decimated
refining
capacity
led
buildup
crude
oil
supplies
discount
which
jumped
just
few
dollars
barrel
widened
as
high

only
briefly
exports

discount
has

once

situation
be
bit
different
time
discount
isn
t
merely
manifestation
surging
shale
production
time
when
opec
is
keeping
rest
market
tight
is
certainly
major
factor
adding
forces
is
pipeline
bottleneck
permian
which
is
leading
higher
volume
supply
trapped
west
permian
basin
alone
has
already
added
bpd
fresh
supply
so
far
year
drilling
frenzy
is
running
hard
midstream
wall
total
production
hit
as
high
million
barrels
day
june
according
eia
adding
bpd
however
problem
is
region
only
has
pipeline
rail
local
refining
capacity
combined
according
genscape
related
opec
has
global
inflation
means
permian
pipeline
system
is
essentially
maxed
is
now
rush
demand
trucking
oil
west
texas
gulf

bizarre
side
effect
bottlenecks
that
have
cropped
moving
oil
truck
is
costly
so
permian
drillers
that
have
not
already
secured

are
being
