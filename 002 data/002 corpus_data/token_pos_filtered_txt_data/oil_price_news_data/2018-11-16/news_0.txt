declined
supply
particularly
is
said
i
am
very
skeptical
saudi
s
maintain

production
it
s
only
about
highest
production
last
decade
they
only
maintained
level
output
few
months
cutting
i
believe

he
believes

spreads
compress
towards

which
is
better
benchmark
global
oil
thing
is
certain
oil
prices
are
sale
relative
where
they
were

it
appears
unlikely
me
continued
