president

said
tweet
saturday
saudi
arabia
agreed
boost
oil
production
million
barrels
day
claim
that
surely
came
news
spoke
king
salman
saudi
arabia
explained
him
turmoil
disfunction
iran
venezuela
i
am
asking
saudi
arabia
increase
oil
production
maybe
barrels
make
difference
prices
high
he
has
agreed
tightening
oil
market
has
pushed
prices
which
is
always
concern
politicians
wary
catching
heat
decision
june
hike
production
looks
increasingly
inadequate
dealing
growing
number
supply
outages
world
it
s
surprise
that
trump
wants
more
saudi
oil
market
he
likely
misunderstood
saudis
told
arabia
was
producing
recent
reports
suggest
they
add
as
much
bpd
july
massive
increase
such
short
period
it
s
far
cry
that
trump
thinks
saudi
arabia
add
translate
overall
production
which
is
probably
unrealistic
few
are
technical
questions
how
far
how
fast
saudi
arabia
push
oil
fields
they
ramp
probably
is
not
lot
historical
evidence
go
also
they
probably
t
do
it
immediately
it
take
time
perhaps
more
second
more
important
reason
why
saudi
arabia
won
t
comply
trump
s
wishes
add
market
is
they
don
t
want
ramping
much
leave
oil
market
dangerously
low
spare
capacity
cutting
it
less
point
supply
disruption
send
oil
prices
skyrocketing
indeed
it
wouldn
t
even
take
tangible
disruption
mere
possibility
outage
lead
significant
volatility
related
oil
exports
overtake
opec
s
number
course
saudi
arabia
is
aware
which
is
why
it
is
extremely
hard
imagine
them
adding
is
why
white
house
walked
back
president
trump
s
comments
when
they
published
details
trump
s
conversation
king
salman
response
president
s
assessment
deficit
oil
market
king
salman
affirmed
kingdom
maintains
two
million
barrel
day
spare
capacity
which
it
prudently
use
when
necessary
ensure
market
balance
stability
statement
white
house
supply
is
very
different
thing
prudently
using
spare
capacity
ensure
market
nevertheless
trump
is
probably
right
oil
market
needs
more
supply
opec
struggle
meet
emerging
supply
gap
which
seems
grow
worse
passing
day
venezuela
has
lost
close
past
two
years
lose
bpd
next
year
outage
canada
is
expected
send
little
bpd
offline
month
july
trump
himself
be
responsible
disrupting
around
more
iranian
do
forget
one
negative
iran
deal
is
you
lose
lot
oil
they
got
make
it
is
big
enemy
iran
you
think
it
iran
is

they
are
going
have

clearly
didn

saudi

losing

market
riyadh
does
not

however
means

likely
saudis
opt
