also
something

is
surprise
venezuela
has
fallen
short
shipments
it
has
promised
figures
are
staggering
april
venezuela
only
shipped
million
barrels

oil
fuels
bpd
it
had
contracted
according

that
means
customers
are
missing

putting
chill
pdvsa
has
critical
structural
problem
that
not
be
fixed
few
weeks
even
few
months
core
problem
is
venezuela
crude
production
has
dropped
far
volumes
we
are
contracted
deliver
company
executive
told
we
simply
are
producing
enough
crude
we
do
have
cash
flow
compensate
purchasing
crude
third
parties
meet
supply
commitments
greatest
operational
concern
right
now
is
production
continues
fall
export
supply
volumes
also
continue
decline
as
result
force
majeure
shipments
seems
unavoidable
is
customers
simply
take
haircut
accept
lower
volumes
pdvsa
source
told
argus
media
that
companies
that
don
t
lower

see
