not
much
kuwait
s
chart
looks
strange
eye
i
believe
kuwait
is
one
two
possibly
three
opec
countries
that
increase
production
somewhat
others
are
saudi
arabia
possibly
united
arab
emirates
libya
is
struggling
peace
ever
breaks
libya
they
increase
production
somewhat
peace
doesn
t
seem
be
horizon
libya
nigerian
crude
oil
production
has
general
downward

how
much
trend
is
due
political

won
t
say

saudi
crude
oil

months
now
saudi
is
only
opec
nation
that
increase
production
considerable
amount
they
possibly
increase
production
one
quarter
one
half
million
barrels
day
likely
lot
closer
one
quarter
million
possibly
uae
is
one
other
two
opec
nations
that
just
be
able
increase
production
somewhat
i
have
more
doubts
uae
i
