begin
cutting
crude
oil
production
again
december
hardly
anyone
cartel
thought
effect
news
prices
be
as
lackluster
it
turned
be
it
took
time
fact
sink
time
too
many
traders
were
worried
future
oil
demand
were
reluctant
speculate
oil
now
opec
is
facing
tough
year
perhaps
even
tougher
it
just
need
reduce
production
even
more
make
it
well

prior
opec
meeting
early
december
opec
didn
t
really
cut
more
million
barrels
day
they
did
just
first
half
not
full
year
we
gravitate
scenario
which
is
brent

bank
s
head
oil
gas
told
cnbc
we
expect
oil
markets
remain
volatile
part
driven
flexible
north
american
shale
production
that
ramp
up
down
quickly
response
changes
investment
levels
conocophillips
ceo
ryan
lance
told
bloomberg
also
american
shale
production
is
course
challenge
opec
s
plans
two
years
it
was
easier
nobody
was
sure
exactly
how
flexible
shale
oil
production
be
so
opec
cuts
worked
helped
brighter
global
economic
outlook
now
things
are
different
shale
production
is
growing
slump
prices
change
prices
fall
further
stay
current
levels
longer
is
far
certain
last
week
december
prices
have
been
decline
three
months
drillers
continued
adding
rigs
related
new
oil
it
wasn
t
just
production
rose
last
year
russia
s
hit
new
record
million
bpd
which
made
it
producer
united
states
saudi
arabia
also
pumped
record
level
million
bpd
months
that
followed
june
decision
reverse
cuts
rein
prices
is
context
which
agreed
new
cuts
which
were
bpd
lower
ones
agreed
wonder
skepticism
is
analysts
believe
once

darling
just
turn
be
right
yesterday
news
saudi
arabia
had
reduced
crude
oil
exports
million
barrels
daily
pushed
prices
only
briefly
brent
west
texas
intermediate
faltered
slid
down
six
months
be
enough
reduce
combined
output
opec
partners
agreed
million
bpd
production
continues
grow
current
rate
it
likely
offset
cut
completely
true
amount
crude
that
is
added
leaves
global
markets
is
not
only
factor
that
counts
type
crude
is
also
important
oil
is
overwhelmingly
light
crude
is
also
global
demand
heavier
grades
middle
east
russia
produce
yet
grades
are
rarely
top
concern
traders
when
they
hear
words
oversupply
volatility
conoco
s
ryan

said
is
clearly
here
stay
likely
intensify
coming
months
just
be
forced
extend
cuts
it
agreed
december
