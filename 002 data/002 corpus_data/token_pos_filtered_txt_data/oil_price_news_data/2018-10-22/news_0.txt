they
see

has
always
been
mission
opec
objective
establishing
permanent
body
raises
question
is
supposed
happen
opec
suggests
that
work
closely
it
seems
confusing
opec
members
are
contains
bunch
additional
countries
how
two
bodies
interact
degree
they
overlap
much
remains
one
certainty
is
is
somewhat
changing
guard
opec
giving
way
governing
structure
dominated
just
two
countries
saudi
arabia
seems
keen
forgoing
struggle
working
more
dozen
countries
build
consensus
preferring
sorts
i
think
russia
have
take
leadership
said
when
asked
be
driving
force
establishing
formalized
secretariat
russia
is
heavy
weight
terms
production
terms
political
influence
so
russia
s
leadership
is
indisputable
s
why
i
expect
russia
play
key
related
biggest
winners
mediterranean
energy
warthe
rest
opec
matter
no
longer
carries
weight
they
once
did
several
opec
members
suffer
instability
volatile
production
levels
are
presiding
declining
output
aside
kuwait
uae
one
else
has
ability
add
subtract
supply
market
based
strategic
political
calculations
just
other
member
is
trying
produce
as
much
even
alluded

still
nominally
adhere
one
country
one
voice
philosophy
he
also
seemed
suggest
group
s
two
largest
producers
really
be
charge
yes
we
ultimately
want
everybody
be
board
experience
is
countries
russia
saudi
arabia
bigger
scale
bigger
impact
ultimately
carry
more
weight
said
people
know
we
agree
cut
five
percent
we
did
volumes
are
when
we
sit
table
voice
carries
more
he
even
suggested
formal
voting
not
really
be
focus
convincing
other
saudi
arabia
russia
set
agenda
rest
follow
does
have

next
few
months
even
many
oil

global
economic
slowdown
more
generally
slow

he
also
was
concerned
