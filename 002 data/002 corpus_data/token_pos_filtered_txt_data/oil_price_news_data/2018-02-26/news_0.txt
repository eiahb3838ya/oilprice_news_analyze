shale drillers are supersizing fracking

shale
drillers
have
squeezed
more
oil
given
well
past
few
years
becoming
more
efficient
drilling
operations
industry
is
still
scaling
shale
executives
are
now
throwing
buzzwords
such
cube
development
supersizing
referring
massive
footprint
today
s
past
shale
companies
figured
way
cut
costs
expanding
production
drilling
more
wells
single
wellpad
essence
that
lowered
average
cost
shale
well
allowing
drillers
do
more
less
other
techniques
were
also
scaled
such
using
more
frac
sand
more
water
drilling
longer
laterals
that
allowed
shale
firms
survive
downturn
it
has
also
led
surging
production
that
is
breaking
new
records
passing
process
continues
shale
companies
are
using
same
logic
today
continue
scale
instance
bloomberg
reports
encana
is
pursuing
drilling
approach
called
cube
development
which
company
drills
wells
single

multiple

permian

targeting
individual
shale
term
refers
notion
driller
is
accessing
entire
cube
surface
rather
just
hydrocarbon
resources
immediately
individual

told
bloomberg
now
it
s
entering

more
more
shale
companies
are
following
approach
supersizing
individual

pull

related
why

shrinking
flip
side
is
question
economics
such
massive
project
which
encana
has
likened
military
occupation
encana
project
likely
cost
million
jpmorgan
analyst
gabriel
daoud
said
according
bloomberg

such
upgrading
gathering
lines
using
more
labor
additional
equipment
call
question
supersizing
really
achieves
benefits
economies

encana
says
approach
produce
more

costs
have
declined

concern
too
many

impact

according
similar
phenomenon
is
playing
shale

arena
well
according

shale
are
supersizing

eqt
largest
gas
producer
country
is
drilling
as
many

extending

eqt
encana
is
also
trying
hit
multiple

shale
companies
are
taking
encana
s
approach
supersized
well
pads
drilling
wells
incremental
fashion
idea
is
company
drill
half
dozen
shale
wells
wait
market
catch
then
return
same
supersized
wellpad
drill
more
wells
meantime
much
upfront
cost
wellpad
has
already
been
spent
additional
wells
are
comparatively
cheap
pull
is
not
yet
percent
clear
trend
supersizing
be
successful
dozens
wells
wellpad
is
preferable
smaller
number
supesizing
proves
be
much
more
efficient
then
upshot
be
shift
more
consolidation
industry
shale
companies
struggle

competitors
