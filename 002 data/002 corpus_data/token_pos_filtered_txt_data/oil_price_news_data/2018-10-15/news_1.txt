it
s
worth
noting
why
exports
are
growing
it
s
not
just
shale
boom
it
s
also
not
only
lifting
oil
export
ban
important
reason

it
is
large
undertaking
still
chevron
is
doing
it
druzin
points
it
be
exception
most
exporting
crude
they
t
absorb
refineries
is
preferred
option
means
exports
are
set
rise
whatever
happens
right
wrong
course
is
such
thing
clearest
sign
yet
oil
is
not
yet
ready
take
is
china
s

india
hence
korea
