is this lithium battery breakthrough too good to be true?

it

month
new

battery
project
didn

make
headlines

month
s
indisputable
winner
is
battery
that
replaces
cobalt
iron
least
according
people
came
up
potential

invention
are
huge
cobalt
is
enjoying
very
strong
rally
demand
is
estimated
skyrocket

christopher
wolverton
professor
materials
science
engineering
northwestern
university
had
two
problems
solve
make
battery
work
first
replace
cobalt
iron
second
trick
oxygen
taking
part
reaction
that
moves
lithium
ions

cathode
back
again
battery
is
charged
second
challenge
was
bigger
one
widespread
opinion
science
circles
is
using
oxygen
reaction
taking
place
rechargeable
battery
makes

see

surprisingly
it

iron
battery
uses

instead
just
one
like

do
now
it
