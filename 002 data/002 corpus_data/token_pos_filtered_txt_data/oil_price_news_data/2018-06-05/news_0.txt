has
been
very
explicit

issues
that
irk
saudi
government
trump
is
also
much
more
aggressive

something
that
goes
down

saudi
saudi

past
biggest
difference
arguably
comes
oil
market
itself
decade
ago
when
president
bush
asked
help
saudi
arabia
saw
little
downside
snubbing
him
was
hopelessly
addicted
oil
had
way
avoid
paying
high
prices
addiction
has
changed
only
marginally
intervening
years
difference
then
now
is
saudi
arabia
has
worry
losing

shale
saudi
shale
narrative
is
bit
overblown
media
fact
matter
is
opec
runs
risk
sparking
too
much
supply
it
lets
prices
rise
too
far
years
past
oil
stimulate
new
investment
projects
take
years
come
online
short
lead
times
shale
however
have
sped
price
cycles
risk
is
high
prices
lead
wave
new
supply
which
crash
prices
again
short
order
indeed
shale
has
already
grown
rapidly
past
few
short
saudi
arabia
looks
ready
increase
production
it
has
variety
reasons
why
it
agree
do
so
it
isn
t
just
riyadh
is
complying
specific
demand
