just
case
you
didn
t
notice
stocks
lost
ground
yesterday
reason
du
jour
was
surge
interest
rates
yield
benchmark
climbed
percent
highest
level
years
jump
extended
curve
year
also
hitting
highest
level
put
pressure
stocks
traders
weighed
potential
slowing
effects
higher
rates
economy
fact
higher
yields
make
bonds
relatively
more
attractive
potentially
diverting

question
here
is

people
are
attracted
investing
energy
sector
several
reasons
recently
one
main
them
is
lack
correlation
stocks
sector
broader
market
energy
stocks
respond
more
moves
price
oil
they
do
anything
else
so
don
t
necessarily
follow
herd
order
assess
potential
impact
stocks
higher
yields
then
we
first
look
it
mean
oil
seem
be
several
reasons
rates
jumped
yesterday
most
obvious
is
fed
is
hiking
rates
has
been
case
while
plan
continue
path
hardly
be
called
secret
more
likely
was
move
front
today
s
jobs
report
which
was
expected
show
higher
average
wages
something
that
is
often
indicator
future
inflation
belief
is
prompt
fed
increase
magnitude
pace
rate
hikes
market
is
discounting
possibility
once
again
relevant
question
here
is
how
affect
energy
stocks
related
why
saudis
t
keep
lid
oil
pricesif
inflation
is
root
concerns
then
far
being
negative
sector
events
last
couple
days
be
positive
least
relatively
short
term
inflation
means
rising
prices
price
oil
go
along
everything
else
i
said
earlier
price
oil
is
one
main
drivers
energy
stocks
so
moves
higher
stocks
follow
we
are
already
seeing
high
prices
supply
constraints
so
jump
result
windfall
oil
rate
hikes
have
been
seen
bad
energy
stocks
because
much
value
least
case
big
multinationals
has
been
derived
dividend
payments
however
following
collapse
oil
prices
couple
years
ago
dividends
have
been
cut
many
cases
making
them
less
factor
energy
investors
so
higher
rates
push
price
investments
such
mlps
lower
they
probably
have
muted
effect
other
oil
stocks
terms
relative
yield
however
picture
becomes
little
less
rosy
we
look
little
further
future
rate
hikes
are
necessary
counter
inflationary
pressure
they
are
not
risk
higher
interest
rates
discourage
borrowing
investment
slowing
economy
they
are
overdone
even
small
amount
that
choke
energy
demand
growth
market
is
currently
pricing
forcing
oil
therefore
energy
stocks
answer
original
question
energy
investors
be
concerned
rising
bond
yields
is
therefore
yes
short
term
inflation
move
is
anticipating
be
positive
long
term
slower
growth
have
negative
effect
circumstances
stocks
fall
response
higher
rates
buying
energy
stocks
makes
sense
least
now
investors
stay
