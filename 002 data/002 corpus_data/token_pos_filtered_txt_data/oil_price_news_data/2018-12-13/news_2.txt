no, the u.s. is not a net exporter of crude oil

last
week
bloomberg
created
quite
stir
story
just
became
net
oil
exporter
first
time
years
i
have
seen
number
stories
that
praised
significance
development
others
laughed
it
misleading
is
truth
viewpoints
yes
headline
is
somewhat
misleading
requires
context
there
continues
be
trend
direction
energy
independence
so
today
i
want
break
numbers
readers
understand
truth
petroleum
production
consumption
crude
production
has
surgedthe
bloomberg
story
is
based
data
energy
information
administration
eia
week
eia
publishes
detailed
statistics
oil
production
consumption
exports
inventories
report
called
weekly
petroleum
status
report
so
let
s
go
straight
week
ending
eia
reported
produced
million
barrels
day
bpd
crude
oil
that
represents
million
bpd
increase
number
number
is
generally
accepted
even
believe
bloomberg
headline
was
down
report
category
products
supplied
is
listed
million
bpd
is
approximate
crude
oil
consumption
week
thus
skeptics
story
suggested
bottom
line
is
is
burning
more
million
bpd
producing
less
million
bpd
thus
conclusion
was
isn
t
close
being
energy
supplybut
is
important
context
numbers
first
million
bpd
is
fairly
accurate
representation
consumption
is
large
production
number
that
isn
t

less

numbers
don
t
account
exports
particular
week
imported
million
bpd

thus
net

were

product
exports
are
different
story

bpd
finished

exporting
million
bpd

ngls
net

so
indeed
when
you
consider

week

was

million
bpd
crude

perspective
average
previous
four

remarkable
achievement
false

is
first

category
weekly

became

number
eia

is
far
cry
when

as

i
tell
bloomberg
