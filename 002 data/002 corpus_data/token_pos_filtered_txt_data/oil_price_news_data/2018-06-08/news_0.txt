infamous
meeting
that
fell
apart
sharp
differences
opinion
saudi
arabia
wanting
increase
production
ease
oil
prices
following
conflagration
parts
north
africa
middle
east
arab
spring
saudis
were
shot
down
much
rest
group
which
opposed
lifting
output
former
saudi
oil
minister
ali
said
it
was
one
worst
meetings
we
have
ever
not
exactly
same
differences
back
then
echo
today
saudi
arabia
wary
hurting
global
economic
growth
also
cautious
not
incentivizing
too
much
supply
wants
add
barrels
back
about
opec
member
gulf
is
unable
increase
production
anyway
it
is
little
surprise
they
are
opposed
higher
production
s
output
is
falling
fast
angola
is
also
losing
production
libya
nigeria
seemed
have
hit
temporary
ceiling
security
issues
always
looming
supply
risk
also
they
don
t
have
official
limits
output
part
opec
deal
is
little
upside
them
supporting
production
increases
other
obviously
is
facing
production
outages
sanctions
it
likely
t
increase
output
even
it
wanted
officials
iraq
algeria
made
negative
comments
past
week
possibility
higher
camp
mexico
s
production
is
falling
anyway
it
has
little
ability
respond
change
only
beneficiaries
higher

violentbut
saudi
arabia
russia
probably
t
simply
allot
themselves
more
production
allowances
risking
revolt
rest
group
they
likely
need
allocate
more
production
everyone
even
act
deciding
formula
also
be
highly
contentious
still
it
be
somewhat
formality
most
members
they
t
increase
production
are
few
possibilities
upcoming
meeting
first
saudi
arabia
russia
convince
group
agree
increase
output
everyone
nominally
is
allowed
increase
output
bit
two
top
producers
make
lion
s
share
increase
that
require
sacrifice
much
group
won
t
be
able
increase
production
have
stomach
lower
oil
possibility
is
breakdown
negotiations
saudi
arabia
russia
go
own
way
increasing
output
talks
