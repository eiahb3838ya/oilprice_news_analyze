we
have
saudis
very
least
need
look
they
are
helping
president
trump
towards
stable
gas
prices
saudis
were
virulently
opposed
iranian
nuclear
deal
president
did
deliver
promise
abandon
it
reinstate
sanctions
however
is
big
caveat
saudis
still
make
ipo
saudi
aramco
hugely
successful
young

muhammad
bin
salman
is
survive
they
ll
need
even
higher

optimally
do
i
think
happen
tightrope
saudis
need
walk
is
key
here
delivering
impression
keeping
oil

it
one
expect
oil
prices
remain
moderated
meeting
date
june
oil
stocks
remain
moderately
priced
well
it
is
possible
many
perceive
pressures
russia
be
too
much
saudis
predict

be
disaster
therefore
sending
oil
stocks
significantly
lower
immediately
prior

bottlenecks
permian
shale
play
finally
cap
oil
increases
there
continued
compliance
assured
crafty
saudi

remains
same
strategy
we
