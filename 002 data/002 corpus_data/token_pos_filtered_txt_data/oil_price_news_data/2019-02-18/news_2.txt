does saudi arabia really have as much oil as analysts think?

officially
venezuela
has
world
s
largest
crude
oil
reserves
billion
barrels
proved
reserves
lot
oil
is
crude
oil
not
be
economical
produce
prevailing
prices
thus
portion
venezuela
s
barrels
reality
no
longer
be
proved
reserves
that
venezuela
s
proved
reserves
jumped
billion
barrels
billion
barrels
main
reason
wasn
t
bunch
new
oil
discoveries
it
was
fact
oil
prices
had
reached
triple
digits
making
venezuela
s
extra
heavy
oil
economical
produce
other
words
resources
oil
ground
were
moved
proved
reserves
oil
that
is
economical
produce
arabia
other
hand
reported
billion
barrels
proved
reserves
billion
barrels
saudi
arabia
s
barrels
were
deemed
be
economical
produce
even
oil
prices
spiked
reason
i
consider
saudi
arabia
s
proved
reserves
percent
global
total
be
most
significance
global
oil
doubts
amount
saudi
arabia
s
reserves
have
persisted
years
saudi
arabia
stopped
allowing
oil
gas
data
be
scrutinized
prior
outsiders
had
access
information
reserves
when
accessibility
was
shut
saudi
proved
oil
reserves
were
estimated
be
billion
saudi
raised
estimate
proved
reserves
billion
barrels
many
pundits
have
suggested
upward
revision
was
based
internal
opec
politics
reserves
were
no
longer
subject
outside
audit
was
great
deal
skepticism
official
numbers
saudis
skepticism
deepened
when
one
considered
saudi
s
reserves
were
billion
barrels
today
nearly
years
later
they
are
reportedly
billion
barrels
meanwhile
saudi
arabia
produced
billion
barrels
how
then
reserves
be
essentially
unchanged
related
is
right
dismiss
nuclear
energy
preparation
potential
ipo
saudi
s
national
oil
company
saudi
aramco
commissioned
outside
audit
proved
reserves
external
audit
found
saudi
s
proved
oil
reserves
be
least
billion
doubts
persist
example
oil
economist
mamdouh
salameh
is
visiting
professor
energy
economics
escp
europe
business
school
london
recently
wrote
calculation
saudi
reserves
based
saudi
production
discovery
oil
till
now
which
we
have
figures
deduction
annual
depletion
rate
saudi
aging
fields
averaging
percent
same
period
gives
figure
bb
remaining
reserves
figures
are
more
less
line
other
i
once
did
similar
calculation
i
started
assumption
estimate
billion
barrels
was
correct
then
i
just
subtracted
saudi
production
then
i
calculated
total
production
billion
barrels
leaving
billion
barrels
i
then
did
sanity
check
that
threw
calculation
doubt
i
did
same
calculation
proved
reserves
same
time
proved
crude
oil
reserves
were
reported
be
billion
barrels
shale
oil
boom
was
underway
proved
reserves
had
only
fallen
billion
barrels
total
production
was
billion
we
extend
calculation
end
proved
reserves
have
actually
jumped
billion
barrels
bp
statistical
review
have
been
billion
barrels
production
reiterate
proved
crude
oil
reserves
stood
billion
barrels
then
produced
billion
barrels
oil
yet
proved
reserves
grew
billion
barrels
related
ukraine
gain
energy
independence
how
did
happen
were
new
discoveries
technological
improvements
that
allowed
more
barrels
be
extracted
existing
fields
higher
prices
made
additional
resources
economical
think
it
s
reasonable
assume
saudi
arabia
also
found
additional
barrels
they
also
have
access
same
kinds
technology
that
improved
recovery
fields
therefore
i
do
not
believe
it
s
legitimate
exercise
consider
depletion
historical
reserves
number
estimate
current
reserves
such
exercise
have
suggested
oil
production
have
fallen
zero
i
don
t
find
reasonable
basis
concluding
saudi
arabia
s
reserves
are
much
lower
official
numbers
published
reserves
are
consistent
independent
audit
they
are
consistent
experience
reserves
growth
significant
oil
you
think
results
are
atypical
you
repeat
exercise
world
s
major
oil
producers
find
same
thing
starting
proved
reserves
subtracting
subsequent
production
not
accurately
predict
reserves
point
future
many
cases
cumulative
production
was
greater
proved
reserves
i
have
thus
far
found
no
good
reason
doubt
