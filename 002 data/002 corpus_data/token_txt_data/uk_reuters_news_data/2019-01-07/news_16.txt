president
jim
yong
kim
unexpectedly
resigned
on
monday
more
than
three
years
before
his
term
ends
in
amid
differences
with
the
trump
administration
over
climate
change
and
the
need
for
more
development
resources
kim
nominated
by
former
president
barack
obama
for
two
terms
had
pushed
financing
for
green
energy
projects
and
largely
dropped
support
for
coal
power
investments
but
had
avoided
public
clashes
with
the
trump
administration
which
has
made
reviving
the
coal
sector
a
priority
kim
told
world
bank
employees
in
an
email
that
he
was
leaving
the
world
s
largest
lender
and
donor
to
poor
and
countries
on
to
join
a
firm
focused
on
infrastructure
investments
in
the
developing
world
the
opportunity
to
join
the
private
sector
was
unexpected
but
i
ve
concluded
that
this
is
the
path
through
which
i
will
be
able
to
make
the
largest
impact
on
major
global
issues
like
climate
change
and
the
infrastructure
deficit
in
emerging
markets
kim
said
kim
said
details
about
his
new
job
would
be
released
at
a
later
date
the
physician
and
former
dartmouth
college
president
said
he
would
also
rejoin
the
board
of
partners
in
health
a
health
advocacy
group
he
years
ago
kristalina
georgieva
who
in
became
the
world
bank
s
chief
executive
officer
will
assume
the
role
of
interim
president
when
kim
departs
the
bank
said
georgieva
a
bulgarian
national
had
previously
held
senior
european
union
posts
after
serving
years
at
the
world
bank
starting
as
an
environmental
economist
in
two
people
familiar
with
kim
s
shock
announcement
to
the
world
bank
executive
board
said
he
was
leaving
of
his
own
accord
and
was
not
pushed
out
by
the
trump
administration
president
donald
trump
however
will
wield
strong
influence
in
choosing
kim
s
successor
as
the
united
states
holds
a
controlling
share
of
the
world
bank
s
voting
rights
the
bank
president
has
traditionally
been
an
american
chosen
by
the
administration
but
some
of
the
multilateral
lender
s
member
countries
could
mount
a
new
challenge
with
alternative
candidates
kim
faced
challengers
from
nigeria
and
colombia
when
he
was
first
nominated
in
a
spokeswoman
for
the
treasury
which
oversees
the
voting
interest
in
the
world
bank
said
we
appreciate
kim
s
service
to
the
world
bank
adding
that
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
looks
forward
to
working
with
his
fellow
governors
in
selecting
a
new
david
malpass
the
treasury
s
undersecretary
for
international
affairs
has
questioned
the
need
for
additional
resources
for
the
world
bank
and
other
international
financial
institutions
arguing
instead
that
the
lenders
should
focus
more
of
their
resources
on
poorer
countries
and
lend
less
to
countries
such
as
china
nonetheless
the
treasury
backed
a
billion
capital
increase
for
the
world
bank
last
year
which
imposed
some
lending
and
management
reforms
including
some
caps
to
the
rate
of
salary
increases
