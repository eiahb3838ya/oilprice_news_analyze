gabon
foiled
an
attempted
military
coup
on
monday
killing
two
suspected
plotters
and
capturing
seven
others
just
hours
after
they
took
over
state
radio
in
a
bid
to
end
years
of
rule
by
president
ali
bongo
s
family
government
spokesman
mapangou
announced
the
deaths
and
arrests
after
soldiers
briefly
seized
the
radio
station
and
broadcast
a
message
saying
bongo
was
no
longer
fit
for
office
after
suffering
a
stroke
in
saudi
arabia
in
october
the
quick
failure
of
monday
s
coup
and
the
lack
of
widespread
support
suggest
further
efforts
to
overthrow
bongo
are
unlikely
analysts
said
but
the
attempt
alone
shows
a
growing
frustration
with
a
government
weakened
by
the
president
s
secretive
medical
leave

in
one
of
his
first
television
appearances
since
the
stroke
bongo
slurred
his
speech

he
appeared
unable

move
his
right
arm
it
is
unclear
if
he
is
able
to
walk
