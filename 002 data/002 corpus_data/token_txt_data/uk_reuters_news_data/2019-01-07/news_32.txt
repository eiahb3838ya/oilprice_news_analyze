london
reuters
british
carmaker
aston
martin
has
triggered
contingency
plans
to
cope
with
a
potentially
disorderly
brexit
including
hiring
a
new
supply
chain
chief
and
preparing
to
fly
in
components
as
well
as
use
ports
other
than
dover
britain
the
world
s
fifth
largest
economy
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
in
just
over
days
but
a
negotiated
withdrawal
agreement
looks
set
to
be
voted
down
by
mps
next
week
making
a
no
deal
exit
and
disruption
to
trade
more
likely
britain
s
car
industry
which
employs
over
people
and
is
one
of
the
country
s
rare
manufacturing
success
stories
has
warned
that
leaving
the
world
s
biggest
trading
bloc
without
a
deal
would
add
costs
and
could
halt
output
due
to
aston
martin
chief
executive
andy
palmer
said
the
luxury
automaker
which
outlined
its
contingency
plans
in
october
had
no
choice
but
to
authorise
them
at
a
board
meeting
in
december
i
don
t
think
we
ve
been
in
a
position
in
the
last
two
years
where
we
ve
been
further
apart
from
understanding
where
we
re
going
to
end
up
palmer
told
reuters
declining
to
put
a
figure
on
the
accumulating
cost
of
the
plans
we
programme
a
car
to
align
and
order
all
the
parts
for
those
cars
twelve
weeks
in
advance
you
don
t
need
to
do
the
maths
to
know
that
therefore
takes
us
across
the
brexit
we
have
to
prepare
for
the
worst
case

joins
a
growing
list
of
companies
readying
for
a
no

brexit
data
last
week
showed
manufacturers
ramping
up
stocks
in
preparation
for
potential
border
delays
aston
is
signing
deals
with
supplier
dhl
to
allow
for
the
use
of
ports
other
than
dover
britain
s
busiest
and
so
most
likely
to
be
disrupted
by
any
customs
delays
and
has
authorised
its
supply
chain
team
to
make
air
freight
bookings
the
government
has
said
it
will
prioritise
the
movement
of
key
supplies
such
as
medicines
if
the
flow
of
goods
is
hit
after
brexit
so
it
is
unclear
what
would
happen
to
other
items
we
don
t
have
any
assurances
said
palmer
one
assumes
if
you
re
putting
parts
onto
a
standard
chartered
plane
no
one
s
going
to
kick
you
aston
martin
which
built
more
than
models
last
year
at
its
central
english
plant
in
gaydon
its
only
factory
is
also
holding
a
stock
of
cars
in
germany
it
s
an
inventory
to
some
extent
that
we
put
in
place
during
the
course
of
and
depending
on
what
happens
in
the
next
few
weeks
may
or
may
not
increase
palmer
said
carmakers
fear
their
production
will
grind
to
a
halt
if
there
are
delays
imposed
after
brexit
but
different
manufacturers
face
different
challenges
volkswagen
group
britain
s
favourite
carmaker
accounting
for
over
percent
of
sales
builds
only
bentleys
in
the
country
while
ford
counts
britain
as
its
market
but
makes
no
cars
there
meantime
nissan
which
builds
around
half
a
million
cars
at
its
northern
english
sunderland
plant
and
toyota
export
the
overwhelming
majority
of
their
vehicles
to
the
rest
of
the
eu
while
brands
are
most
worried
about
potential
trade
tariffs
smaller
players
such
as
aston
and
mclaren
believe
their
affluent
customers
could
absorb
extra
costs
and
are
more
concerned
about
customs
checks
and
delays
aston
has
hired
john
griffiths
who
has
worked
for
nissan
and
aerospace
firm
as
interim
vice
president
for
supply
chain
in
a
role
palmer
said
there
was
a
nagging
need
for
which
has
been
confirmed
with
palmer
criticised
politicians
on
both
sides
of
the
channel
both
the
european
and
the
uk
politicians
are
not
discharging
the
duty
for
which
they
are
put
in
place
which
is
basically
to
plan
and
bring
certainty
to
allow
the
country
to
thrive
he
said
as
carmakers
prepare
for
multiple
brexit
eventualities
they
are
also
dealing
with
stricter
emissions
rules
and
a
slowdown
in
the
world
s
economy
china
which
has
hit
a
variety
of
firms
including
apple
while
some
automakers
have
reported
falling
demand
aston
which
has
seen
its
share
price
fall
by
more
than
a
third
since
it
listed
in
october
said
it
had
a
record
there
has
not
been
any
downflow
since
those
numbers
so
in
fact
broadly
speaking
the
opposite
as
we
launched
sports
cars
dbs
and
vantage
into
china
