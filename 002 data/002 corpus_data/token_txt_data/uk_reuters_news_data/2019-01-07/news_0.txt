update 1-venezuela's pdvsa in oil deal with firm part-owned by florida republican
caracas
reuters
venezuelan
state
oil
firm
pdvsa
has
signed
a
deal
with
energy
firm
erepla
partly
owned
by
a
prominent
florida
republican
to
help
increase
the
country
s
plummeting
crude
oil
output
the
company
said
erepla
services
llc
with
an
undisclosed
stake
held
by
republican
harry
sargeant
iii
and
which
delaware
state
records
show
was
only
registered
in
november
said
it
plans
to
invest
up
to
million
to
increase
production
at
three
venezuelan
oil
fields
in
exchange
for
a
portion
of
the
crude
produced
sargeant
and
petróleos
de
venezuela
known
as
pdvsa
have
clashed
in
the
past
between
and
pdvsa
was
awarded
million
after
a
company
partly
owned
by
sargeant
was
accused
of
not
paying
for
several
crude
shipments
in
and
court
records
show
the
new
arrangement
faces
significant
hurdles
including
obtaining
an
exemption
from
trump
administration
sanctions
that
block
companies
from
providing
financing
to
the
government
of
president
nicolas
maduro
or
venezuelan
state
firms
it
is
a
further
sign
that
venezuela
is
tapping
inexperienced
firms
to
stem
massive
declines
in
crude
output
as
more
established
oil
companies
steer
clear
of
the
troubled
country
due
to
concerns
about
sanctions
and
overall
dysfunction
erepla
said
the
agreement
will
revitalize
oil
production
at
the
tia
juana
lago
and
rosa
mediano
fields
in
the
western
lake
maracaibo
region
and
in
the
ayacucho
bloc
in
the
eastern
orinoco
belt
the
company
added
that
the
deal
gives
it
enhanced
managerial
participation
in
the
projects
and
will
be
responsible
for
procurement
a
key
difference
from
joint
ventures
between
pdvsa
and
oil
majors
like
chevron
corp
where
pdvsa
has
full
operational
control
erepla
said
it
would
be
responsible
for
the
entirety
of
the
a
spokesman
declined
to
elaborate
on
how
it
would
raise
the
funds
neither
pdvsa
nor
the
oil
ministry
responded
to
requests
for
comment
the
erepla
spokesman
said
sargeant
who
has
served
as
finance
chairman
of
the
florida
republican
party
and
runs
asphalt
trading
and
shipping
firm
global
oil
management
group
owns
a
stake
in
erepla
but
declined
to
reveal
the
percentage
the
deal
is
the
first
new
partnership
between
pdvsa
and
a
private
company
since
oil
minister
manuel
quevedo
in
august
announced
a
set
of
joint
service
agreements
with
companies
that
did
not
appear
to
have
experience
operating
oilfields
and
pdvsa
those
contracts
were
similar
to
ones
rolled
back
under
late
socialist
leader
hugo
chavez
who
expanded
the
state
s
role
in
the
opec
country
s
energy
industry
output
has
continued
to
stagnate
since
the
deals
were
signed
dropping
to
million
barrels
per
day
in
november
from
more
than
million
at
the
end
of
last
year
according
to
opec
figures
in
a
sign
of
the
company
s
struggles
under
military
rule
washington
has
levied
several
rounds
of
sanctions
on
venezuela
that
block
citizens
from
providing
financing
to
maduro
s
government
without
placing
explicit
restrictions
on
commerce
or
investment
but
because
pdvsa
is
perennially
agreements
to
boost
production
usually
involve
partner
companies
putting
up
significant
amounts
of
upfront
funding
that
could
run
afoul
of
sanctions
erepla
said
it
had
applied
to
the
treasury
department
s
office
of
foreign
assets
control
which
implements
sanctions
for
a
specific
license
affirming
the
the
treasury
department
generally
does
not
comment
on
individual
license
applications
or
the
timeline
for
reviewing
them
a
treasury
spokesperson
said
the
erepla
spokesman
said
the
firm
s
ownership
includes
serious
and
significant
oilfield
production
capabilities
as
well
as
heavy
oil
refining
erepla
said
its
minority
owner
is
an
international
oil
company
that
produces
over
barrels
per
day
in
a
terrain
similar
to
the
venezuelan
fields
but
the
spokesman
declined
to
name
the
owner
sargeant
maintained
business
ties
to
pdvsa
in
the
early
through
a
company
that
he
partly
owned
called
trigeant
whose
corpus
christi
refinery
processed
venezuelan
crude
into
asphalt
according
to
court
records
pdvsa
won
arbitration
claims
against
trigeant
in
and
totaling
million
for
unpaid
crude
cargoes
and
received
a
million
payment
according
to
court
records
before
having
paid
the
full
amount
trigeant
sold
the
refinery
to
a
third
party
pdvsa
won
a
court
order
blocking
the
sale
arguing
that
it
was
a
fraudulent
transfer
meant
to
prevent
it
from
collecting
on
the
arbitration
judgment
because
sargeant
had
a
controlling
stake
in
the
buyer
trigeant
later
declared
bankruptcy
and
an
attorney
for
sargeant
said
he
ultimately
made
pdvsa
ultimately
harry
iii
resolved
pdvsa
s
claims
to
their
satisfaction
chris

lardner
said
by
phone
maduro
who
has
deepened
venezuela
s
relationships
with
adversaries
like
russia
and
china
often
accuses
the
united
states
of
plotting
to
overthrow
him
and
steal
the
opec
nation
s
oil
wealth
the
deal
has
been
criticized
by
hardline
chavez
supporters
who
say
it
cedes
too
much
control
to
a
foreign
company
this
is
the
worst
giveaway
in
the
history
of
our
country
s
oil
industry
former
oil
minister
rafael
ramirez
wrote
in
a
blog
post
on
sunday
maduro
and
quevedo
will
have
to
be
held
to
account
for
giving
away
assets
belonging
to
all
venezuelans

ceding
