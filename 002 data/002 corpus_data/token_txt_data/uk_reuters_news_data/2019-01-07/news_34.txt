is
expected
to
grow
for
a
second

and
an
industry
lobby
group
said
on
monday
western
europe
s
largest
oil
producer
has
seen
a
recovery
in
oil
industry
activity
thanks
to
higher
crude
prices
after
a
slump

is
estimated
to
rise
by

billion

billion
the
norwegian
oil
and
gas
association
nog
said
it
previously
expected
investment
of
billion
crowns
it
is
good
news
that
activity
is
so
high
on
the
norwegian
continental
shelf
we
believe
this
is
because
of
the
significant
restructuring
the
industry
has
done
in
recent
years
which
has
increased
competitiveness
the
lobby
said
in
a
statement
but
it
said
investment
would
start
to
fall
after
to
billion
crowns
in
billion
crowns
in
billions
crowns
in
and
billion
crowns
in
the
group
said
its
forecast
for
investment
was
based
on
a
survey
of
companies
that
was
completed
before
october
when
oil
was
trading
at
above
a
barrel
since
then
prices
had
dropped
and
were
trading
at
a
barrel
on
monday
nog
head
karl
eirik
said
the
price
fall
was
not
expected
to
have
a
major
impact
we
think
the
projects
are
quite
robust
because
the
companies
have
been
focused
to
make
them
economic
at
even
lower
oil
prices
he
said
norway
s
equinor
said
its
new
projects
had
an
average
price
of
a
barrel
while
aker
bp
said
it
would
not
invest
in
projects
with
price
higher
than
a
barrel
i
m
very
concerned
about
the
need
to
focus
on
the
costs
said
nog
said
exploration
spending
was
expected
to
rise
to
billion
crowns
in
from
billion

although
the
number
of
wells
being
drilled
was
not
expected
to
change
from
