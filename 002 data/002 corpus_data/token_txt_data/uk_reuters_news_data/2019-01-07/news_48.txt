air
pollution
in
china
s
province
of
henan
worsened
in
december
even
as
other
regions
improved
official
data
showed
with
its
cities
hit
by
unfavorable
weather
and
a
struggle
to
find
cleaner
sources
of
economic
growth
china
is
restricting
industrial
output
traffic
and
coal
consumption
in
the
north
for
a
second
year
in
a
bid
to
cut
pollution
during
the
winter
heating
period
when
thousands
of
mainly
boilers
are
switched
on
but
nine
cities
in
henan
home
to
around
million
people
still
recorded
a
rise
in
small
emissions
known
as
to
an
average
of
micrograms
per
cubic
meter
in
the
last
month
of
up
percent
from
a
year
earlier
emissions
in
the
cities
which
include
several
big
steel
aluminum
and
coal
producing
districts
had
already
soared
by
percent
from
a
year
earlier
in
november
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of
official
data
as
many
as
cities
throughout
the
north
and
east
have
drawn
up
plans
to
control
smog
this
winter
with
many
committed
to
cutting
emissions
by
percent
from
last
year
for
these
cities
average
levels
fell
percent
in
december
from
a
year
earlier
to
micrograms
per
cubic
meter
according
to
reuters
calculations
although
still
nearly
double
china
s
national
standard
of
micrograms
but
the
local
increases
in
henan
and
elsewhere
show
how
much
cities
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
weather
with
conditions
such
as
high
humidity
and
low
wind
exacerbating
smog
my
analysis
indicates
that
the
rises
in
henan
are
accounted
for
by
the
weather
said
lauri
myllyvirta
energy
analyst
with
greenpeace
henan
s
smog
concentrations
have
worsened
since
the
end
of
last
year
with
the
local
government
saying
on
saturday
that
provincial
cities
have
issued
red
alerts
for
the
coming
week
some
cities
in
the
major
pollution
control
zone
around
china
s
capital
beijing
are
also
struggling
to
meet
winter
air
quality
targets
with
average
in
the
last
two
months
of
up
percent
compared
with
a
year
earlier
the
zone
includes
the
country
s
top
steel
producing
province
of
hebei
where
average
emissions
rose
percent
in
the
last
two
months
of
hebei
has
promised
to
cut
by
percent
this
year
compared
to
the
official
hebei
daily
reported
on
monday
citing
the
local
environmental
bureau
it
vowed
to
cut
another
million
tonnes
of
steel
smelting
capacity
and
million
tonnes
of
coal
production
after
shutting
million
tonnes
and
million
tonnes
respectively
in
the
province
said
last
week
it
had
cut
by
percent
to
an
average
of
micrograms
over
the
whole
of
beating
its
target
