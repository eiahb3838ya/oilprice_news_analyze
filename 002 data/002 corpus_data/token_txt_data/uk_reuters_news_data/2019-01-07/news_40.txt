a

in
the
united

decisive
action
from
the
chinese
central
bank
and
dovish
messages
from
federal
reserve
chief
jerome
powell
combined
to
push
world
stocks
further
off
recent
lows
on
monday
the
resumption
of
talks
between
the
united
states
and
china
on
tariffs
also
helped
bring
back
some
optimism
to
a
market
battered
in
recent
weeks
by
trade
tensions
and
a
weakening
global
growth
outlook
european
shares
held
on
to
friday
s
strong
gains
after
a
stellar
opening
for
asian
bourses
pushing
msci
s
world
equity
index
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
to
its
highest
level
in
weeks
it
is
now
percent
higher
than
its
december
trough
it
is
a
reminder
that
central
banks
still
have
some
firepower
to
deal
with
lower
growth
prospects
and
perhaps
what
we
are
also
getting
some
return
of
liquidity
as
investors
return
from
the
holidays
and
the
ability
to
think
things
through
said
investec
economist
philip
shaw
he
warned
however
that
there
is
continued
uncertainty
about
global
growth
trade
talks
between
the
united
states
and
china
and
monetary
policy
there
are
a
number
of
questions
that
remain
unanswered
shaw
said
on
friday
payrolls
data
showed
the
world
s
largest
economy
added
net
new
jobs
in
december
while
wages
rose
at
a
brisk
annual
pace
of
percent
both
way
above
expectations
this
along
with

cut
in

s

ratios
and
comments
from
fed
chair
jerome
powell
that
the
central
bank
would
be
flexible
in
its
approach
in
has
been
the
main
driver
for
the
recovery
the
boost
to
stock
markets
saw
them
recapture
all
the
year
s
losses
and
push
into
positive
territory
for
so
far
with
wall
st
s
main
indices
closing
up
more
than
percent
by
the
close
on
friday
after
gains
of
more
than
percent
in
shanghai
and
hk
on
friday
before
the
jobs
data
and
powell
s
comments
both
markets
added
almost

more

monday
japan

friday
s
plunge
to
gain

european
stocks
were
more
or
less
flat
across
the
board
though
mining
stocks
surged
percent
after
the
reserve
requirement
ratio
cut
from
china
boosted
metals
prices
especially
steel
and
iron
ore
this
renewed
optimism
saw
treasury
yields
rise
off
recent
lows
and
yields
move
back
above
the
federal
funds
rate
to
percent
that
is
nearly
bps
below
the
november
peak
however
suggesting
there
is
still
plenty
of
nervousness
around
growth
prospects
for
the
economy
clearly
markets
are
now
pricing
in
the
risk
of
a
cut
in
said
shaw
of
investec
that
s
a
big
shift
given
until
relatively
recently
when
we
ve
been
focusing
on
rate
some
of
the
stocks
recovery
may
be
attributed
to
investors
buying
stocks
once
again
in
the
belief
that
the
market
had
bottomed
out
or
had
overshot
in
pricing
in
global
risks
in
any
case
friday
was
a
strong
session
for

with
the

recording
gains
of

while

as
we
expect
global
