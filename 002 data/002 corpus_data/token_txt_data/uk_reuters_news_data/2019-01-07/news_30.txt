greece
has
given
investors
another
week
to
to
submit
binding
bids
for
three
power
plants
and
a
licence
to
build
another
one
a
senior
energy
ministry
official
told
reuters
on
monday
public
power
ppc
is
selling
the
plants
in
northern
greece
and
on
the
southern
peloponnese
under
the
terms
of
athens
latest
international
bailout
after
an
eu
court
ruled
that
ppc
had
abused
its
dominant
position
in
the
coal
market
the
bid
deadline
has
been
repeatedly
pushed
back
since
the
tender
was
launched
last
year
for
different
reasons
ppc
has
shortlisted
six
investors
but
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
who
declined
to
be
named
said
only
three
may
submit
binding
bids
ppc
which
is
percent
and
the
energy
ministry
are
handling
the
divestment
and
the
eu
commission
is
overseeing
the
process
the
deadline
was
pushed
back
because
ppc
wants
to
first
conclude
a
voluntary
redundancy
scheme
it
has
offered
to
its
workers
the
official
said
declining
to
be
named
investors
will
then
have
a
clearer
picture
of
the
plants
workforce
the
official
added
ppc
employs
about
people
at
the
plants
and
aims
for
about
to
sign
up
to
the
voluntary
redundancy
scheme
or
opt
to
move
to
other
subsidiaries
within
the
group
by
later
this
week
according
to
another
source
close
to
the
process
ppc
declined
to
comment
on
the
issue
ppc
s
chairman
has
called
for
the
bid
deadline
to
be
extended
to
february
saying
this
was
needed
to
ensure
bidders
had
all
the
necessary
information
to
make
their
offers
including
a
european
commision
decision
on
whether
the
plants
would
be
financially
rewarded
for
making
capacity
available
however
the
energy
ministry
has
pushed
for
the
process
to
be
wrapped
up
earlier
the
six
