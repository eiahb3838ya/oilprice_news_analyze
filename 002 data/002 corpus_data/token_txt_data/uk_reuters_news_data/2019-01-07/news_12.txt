reuters
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
predicted
on
monday
that
beijing
and
washington
could
reach
a
trade
deal
that
we
can
live
with
as
dozens
of
officials
from
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
resumed
talks
in
a
bid
to
end
their
trade
dispute
ross
told
cnbc
the
immediate
trade
issues
would
be
easiest
to
tackle
while
enforcement
issues
and
structural
reforms
such
as
intellectual
property
rights
and
market
access
would
be
more
challenging
to
resolve
i
think
there
s
a
very
good
chance
that
we
will
get
a
reasonable
settlement
that
china
can
live
with
that
we
can
live
with
and
that
addresses
all
of
the
key
issues
ross
said
in
an
interview
with
cnbc
china
s
foreign
ministry
said
beijing
had
the
good
faith
to
work
with
the
united
states
to
resolve
trade
frictions
as
chinese
officials
met
their
counterparts
in
beijing
for
the
first
talks
since
president
donald
trump
and
chinese
president
xi
jinping
agreed
in
december
to
a
truce
in
a
trade
war
that
has
roiled
global
markets
after
the
first
day
of
talks
wrapped
up
chinese
importers
made
their
third
large
purchase
of
soybeans
in
the
past
month
traders
said
but
china
has
bought
only
around
million
tonnes
since
purchases
resumed
in
december
less
than
percent
of
the
beans
it
bought
a
year
earlier
trump
said
on
sunday
that
trade
talks
with
china
were
going
very
well
and
that
weakness
in
the
chinese
economy
gave
beijing
a
reason
to
work
towards
a
deal
ross
told
cnbc
the
talks
were
being
held
with
staff
and
would
help
determine
how
the
administration
moves
forward
the
two
sides
agreed
to
hold
positive
and
constructive
dialogue
to
resolve
economic
and
trade
disputes
in
accordance
with
the
consensus
reached
by
their
respective
leaders
foreign
ministry
spokesman
lu
kang
told
a
regular
news
briefing
from
the
beginning
we
have
believed
that
trade
friction
is
not
a
positive
situation
for
either
country
or
the
world
economy
china
has
the
good
faith
on
the
basis
of
mutual
respect
and
equality
to
resolve
the
bilateral
trade
trump
imposed
import
tariffs
on
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
of
chinese
goods
last
year
and
has
threatened
more
to
pressure
beijing
to
change
its
practices
on
issues
ranging
from
industrial
subsidies
to
intellectual
property
to
hacking
china
has
retaliated
with
tariffs
of
its
own
as
for
whether
the
chinese
economy
is
good
or
not
i
have
already
explained
this
china
s
development
has
ample
tenacity
and
huge
potential
lu
said
we
have
firm
confidence
in
the
strong
fundamentals
of
the
chinese
lu
also
said
vice
president
wang
qishan
would
attend
the
annual
world
economic
forum
in
davos
switzerland
in
late
january
but
added
that
he
had
not
yet
heard
of
any
arrangements
for
a
meeting
with
trump
there
few
details
emerged
of
the
trade
talks
which
were
scheduled
to
run
through
tuesday
although
the
talks
were
held
at
a
vice
ministerial
level
chinese
vice
premier
liu
he
who
has
led
trade
negotiations
with
the
united
states
and
is
a
top
economic
adviser
to

made
an
unexpected
appearance
at
the
meetings
on
monday
according
to
a
person
familiar
with
the
discussions
leaked

posted
on
the

applauding
liu

appearance
including
the

deputy

gerrish
another

a
wider

of
dozens
of
officials
from
each
country
seated
at
three
long
tables
facing
each
other
and
around
the
room
s
borders
significantly
more
people
than
those
attending
previous
rounds
of
trade
talks
a
source
familiar
with
the
talks
said
this
could
indicate
that
more
detailed
discussions
were
likely
taking
place
the
delegation
includes
under
secretaries
from
the
departments
of
agriculture
commerce
energy
and
treasury
as
well
as
senior
officials
from
the
white
house
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
told
cnbc
that
the
united
states
and
china
are
making
progress
on
trade
i
hope
too
that
we
ll
make
progress
on
all
of
the
other
places
whether
china
s
not
behaving
in
the
way
that
we
wish
it
would
whether
that
s
their
cyber
activity
that
has
had
a
real
impact
whether
that
s
the
theft
of
intellectual
property
which
has
hurt
american
businesses
tu
xinquan
a
chinese
trade
expert
at
beijing
s
university
of
international
business
and
economics
told
reuters
before
talks
began
that
the
meetings
would
likely
focus
on
technical
issues
and
leave
major
disagreements
to
more
senior
officials
data
last
week
showed
manufacturing
has
slowed
in
both
china
and
the
united
states
though
the
labour
department
on
friday
reported
a
surge
in
new
jobs
in
december
along
with
higher
wages
officials
have
given
scant
details
on
concessions
that
china
might
be
willing
to
make
to
meet
demands
some
of
which
would
require
structural
reforms
unpalatable
for
chinese
leaders
even
if
a
trade
agreement
is
reached
soon
analysts
say
it
would
be
no
panacea
for
china
s
economy
which
is
expected
to
continue
decelerating
in
coming
months
