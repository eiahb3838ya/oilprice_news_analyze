india
will
allow
explorers
to
rope
in
the
private
sector
to
raise
production
from
old
fields
as
the
world
s
third
biggest
oil
importer
strives
to
better
exploit
its
hydrocarbon
resources
and
cut
dependence
on
foreign
oil
india
is
the
world
s
oil
consumer
and
buys
about
percent
of
its
supplies
from
abroad
prime
minister
narendra
modi
has
set
a
target
to
cut
india
s
dependence
on
foreign
oil
to
percent
by
india
is
looking
at
raising
production
from
nomination
blocks
or
fields
handed
to
oil
and
natural
gas
corp
ongc
and
oil
india
ltd
after
independence
oil
minister
dharmendra
pradhan
said
on
monday
the
fields
are
both
onshore
and
offshore
the
boards
of
ongc
and
oil
india
will
be
allowed
to
issue
production
enhancement
contracts
and
bring
in
private
players
to
drill
some
nomination
fields
pradhan
said
he
said
the
current
fiscal
model
was
not
supportive
of
raising
output
from
nomination
fields
revenue
was
the
priority
at
one
point
of
time
but
now
the
government
is
of
the
view
that
the
priority
is
to
raise
production
pradhan
told
reporters
at
a
function
to
launch
the
country
s
second
licensing
round
under
new
rules
india
has
offered
blocks
under
the
latest
auction
and
will
offer
another
fields
including
five
coal
bed
methane
blocks
in
the
next
round
later
this
month
it
hopes
to
launch
two
more
rounds
by
december
pradhan
also
said
india
would
offer
higher
incentives
for
production
from
old
blocks
in
frontier
or
difficult
areas
so
far
the
key
criteria
for
winning
a
block
has
been
the
higher
revenue
offered
to
the
government
from
the
oil
and
gas
production
but
the
policy
has
not
helped
oil
and
gas
output
which
has
been
stagnant
for
years
after
the
discovery
of
the
bombay
high
oil
fields
in
and
bassein
gas
fields
in
ongc
has
not
been
able
to
bring
any
new
major
fields
into
production
in
the
last
four
decades
india
has
also
failed
to
draw
interest
from
global
oil
majors
in
licensing
rounds
since
even
though
the
fiscal
terms
were
eased
however
royal
dutch
shell
and
bp
later
bought
stakes
from
firms
that
had
won
drilling
rights
