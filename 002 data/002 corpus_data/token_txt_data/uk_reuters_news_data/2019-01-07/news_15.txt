that
the
country
s
offensive
against
fuel
theft
was
yielding
good
results
and
would
continue
though
it
has
provoked
fuel
shortages
and
long
lines
of
angry
motorists
as
part
of
the
campaign
to
combat
chronic
theft
of
gasoline
state
oil

pemex
is
changing
its
distribution
triggering
shortages
in
at
least
six
states

at
a
news
conference
that
the
government
had
not
established
a
date

was
not

have
enough
gasoline

showed
long
lines
of
drivers
waiting
to
fill
up
in
central
states
as
well
as
jalisco

and
tamaulipas
in
the
north
years
of
massive
theft
of
fuel
by
criminal
groups
and
others
mostly
by
tapping
pipelines
has
led
to
steep
losses
for
the
government
and
pemex
the
government
led
by
lopez
obrador
has
already
ordered
the
armed
forces
to
intervene
in
pemex
s
facilities
including
one
refinery
the
supply
will
normalize
and
at
the
same
time
we
are
going
to
guarantee
that

is
not
stolen

we
have
seen
a
reduction
in
