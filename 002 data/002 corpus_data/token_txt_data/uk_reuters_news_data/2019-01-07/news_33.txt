its

dramatic
climatic
events
like
the
warm

dry
summer
in
large
parts
of
europe
or
the
increasing

around
the
arctic
regions
are
alarming
signs

she
told

the
last
four
years
have
seen
the
highest
average
temperatures
since
records
began
in
the
century
was
the
hottest
boosted
by
an
el
nino
event
that
warmed
the
surface
of
the
pacific
ocean
ahead
of
and
then
the
copernicus
report
said
that
concentrations
of
carbon
dioxide
in
the
atmosphere
rose
to
a
new
record
of
parts
per
million
ppm
in
from
in
stoked
largely
by
human
burning
of
fossil
fuels
and
the
average
global
temperature
in
the
past
five
years
was
above
times
it
said
according
to
a
climate
report
last
year
temperatures
will
rise
above
times
by
on
current
trends
bringing
the
prospect
of
even
more
extreme
weather
that
report
said
governments
would
have
to
make
unprecedented
cuts
in
greenhouse
gases
to
keep
temperatures
below
the
rise
which
is
the
toughest
goal
set
in
the
paris
agreement
almost
nations
agreed
a
rule
book
to
govern
the
paris
accord
in
talks
in
poland
last
month
even
though
critics
said
it
was
insufficient
to
prevent
dangerous
climate
change
the
paris
accord
seeks
to
end
the
fossil
fuel
era
this
century
by
shifting
to
cleaner
energies
such
as
wind
and
solar
power
president
donald
trump
plans
to
pull
out
and
instead
promote
the
fossil

industry
the
copernicus
report
confirms
projections
by
the
s
world
meteorological
organization
wmo
in
november
that
would
be
fourth
warmest
the
wmo
will
issue
its
