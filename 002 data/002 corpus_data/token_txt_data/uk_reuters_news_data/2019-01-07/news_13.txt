egypt
s
foreign
currency
reserves
fell
to
billion
in
december
from
billion
in
november
the
central
bank
said
on
monday
the
first
drop
since
a
currency
devaluation
the
last
time
egypt
s
foreign
currency
reserves
fell
was
in
october
the
month
before
it
signed
a
billion
deal
with
the
international
monetary
fund
that
included
a
currency
float
that
deal
was
part
of
an
effort
to
attract
foreign
investors
who
fled
during
egypt
s
uprising
the
central
bank
did
not
give
reasons
for
the
drop
it
was
a
surprise

brokerage
head
of
research
allen
sandeep
said
of
the
development
adding
he
was
unsure
of
the
reasons
egypt
expects
to
receive
the
fifth
instalment
of
its
imf
loan
worth
billion
in
january
that
tranche
will
offset
december
s
drop
sandeep
forecast
in
january
i
would
think
it
would
go
back
to
the
billion
mark
he
said
the
fifth
tranche
had
been
expected
in
december
and
the
delay
has
likely
contributed
to
the
drop
in
reserves
said
alia
mamdouh
director
of
macro
and
strategy
at
beltone
financial
i
don
t
think
it
s
alarming
because
we
are
expecting
the
tranche
to
be
disbursed
in
january
and
billion
euro
bonds
are
expected
to
be
issued
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
she
said
the
central
bank
also
had
outstanding
liabilities
of
billion
in
december
that
would
have
contributed
to
the
decrease
in
foreign
reserves
said
mamdouh
egypt
has
been
pursuing
tough
economic
reforms
as
part
of
the
imf
programme
in
addition
to
the
currency
devaluation
reforms
have
included
new
taxes
and
deep
cuts
to
energy
subsidies
straining
the
budget
of
tens
of
millions
