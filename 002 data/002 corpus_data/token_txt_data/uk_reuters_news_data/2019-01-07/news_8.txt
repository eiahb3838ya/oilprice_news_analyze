crude
oil
is
starting
to
trickle
back
to
china
with
three
cargoes
slated
to
arrive
next
month
but
volumes
are
still
a
long
way
off
levels
prior
to
the
outbreak
of
trade
hostilities
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
data
compiled
by
refinitiv
shows
three
tankers
carrying
million
barrels
are
en
route
from
the
united
states
to
china
and
will
arrive
in
february
this
is
up
from
zero
cargoes
slated
to
arrive
in
january
a
mere
one
in
december
and
zero
in
both
november
and
october
prior
to
the
tariffs
being
imposed
from
the
middle
of
last
year
crude
oil
was
a
success
story
in
the
trade
relationship
as
beijing
bought
increasing
volumes
of
booming
shale
oil
production
in
the
first
nine
months
of
this
year
china
imported
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
from
the
united
states
representing
about
percent
of
its
total
crude
imports
china
s
imports
of
crude
reached
a
record
high
of
about
bpd
in
june
according
to
the
refinitiv
data
it
s
worth
noting
that
china
hasn
t
imposed
any
tariff
on
crude
imports
unlike
coal
and
liquefied
natural
gas
which
were
included
in
beijing
s
retaliatory
measures
what
seems
clear
is
that
chinese
refiners
decided
to
hold
back
on
buying
crude
either
because
they
were
nudged
in
that
direction
by
the
government
or
because
they
were
concerned
that
a
tariff
would
be
imposed
using
crude
oil
for
politics
is
certainly
nothing
new
so
the
resumption
of
trade
between
china
and
the
united
states
may
well
depend
on
the
status
of
talks
between
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
and
its
counterpart
in
beijing
however
if
the
crude
trade
was
strictly
about
economics
it
s
likely
that
crude
prices
will
have
to
fall
some
more
especially
relative
to
competing
grades
of
west
african
crude
the
bulk
of
the
crude
going
to
asia
is
light
and
sweet
and
therefore
competes
with
grades
like
nigeria
s
bonny
light
and
angola
s
girassol
while
west
texas
intermediate
wti
futures
have
dropped
sharply
since
their
peak
in
early
october
the
price
of
physical
wti
delivered
in
houston
as
assessed
by
argus
media
hasn
t
fallen
by
as
much
wti
houston
was
at
a
barrel
on
while
wti
futures
were
at
a
discount
of
a
barrel
six
months
ago
wti
houston
was
at
a
barrel
and
the
futures
were
showing
that
since
then
the
investor
market
has
become
more
bearish
on
crude
prices
than
the
physical
market
comparing
wti
houston
to
girassol
shows
that
the
angolan
grade
traded
at
a
small
premium
on
closing
at
a
barrel
to
wti
houston
s
the
small
price
advantage
for
the
physical
wti
is
not
enough
to
overcome
the
higher
cost
of
a
longer
voyage
to
asia
meaning
that
crude
is
currently
uncompetitive
this
suggests
that
exporters
will
have
to
be
prepared
to
offer
deeper
discounts
if
they
wish
to
displace
west
african
barrels
from
the
asian
markets
a
further
complicating
factor
is
the
new
output
cuts
announced
by
opec
and
its
allies
chiefly
russia
it
s
likely
that
much
of
the
oil
affected
by
the
production
restrictions
will
be
medium
to
heavy
grades
given
that
the
bulk
of
the
cutting
will
be
done
by
saudi
arabia
and
russia
this
is
likely
to
tighten
the
market
for
heavier
grades
which
are
not
readily
replaced
by
light
crudes
such
as
wti
even
if
there
are
plentiful
supplies
of
the
light
crudes
this
means
that
even
if
the
united
states
is
increasing
its
output
there
may
not
be
enough
demand
for
light
crudes
to
soak
up
the
extra
supply
