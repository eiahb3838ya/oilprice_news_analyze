itself
up
for

according
to
a
person
close
to
the
elliott
camp
the
letter
said
qep
remained
undervalued
despite
its
efforts
to
focus
on
the
permian
basin
the
largest
oil
field
where
its
operations
are
more
lucrative
than
in
other
regions
where
it
is
selling
properties
after
the

billionaire
activist
investor
paul
singer
s
elliott
shares
of
the
qep
jumped
percent
to
on

stake
in

qep
in
a
statement
acknowledged
receiving
the
proposal
and
said
it
would
carefully

in
light
of

interests
and
the
current
market
qep
s
shares
traded
above
as
recently
as
july
when
benchmark
crude
oil
traded
above
since
then
crude
has
since
fallen
more
than
percent
and
last
traded

elliott
would
run
qep
as
an
independent
private
company
if
the
deal
goes
through
according
to
the
source
close
to
the
hedge
fund
elliott
believes
the
company
s
permian
acreage
could
attract
competing
bids
according
to
the
person
qep
s
acres
in
the
permian
are
contiguous
making
it
easier
to
drill
horizontal
wells
that
extend
up
to
two
miles
neighboring
operators
include
exxon
mobil
corp
encana
corp
and
diamondback
energy
inc
all
three
companies
could
make
a
case
that
the
qep
assets
would
fold
in
to
their
permian
operations
said
jeoffrey
lambujon
a
equity
researcher
at
tudor
pickering
holt
and
oil
has
plunged
since
october
as
investors
worried
about
oversupply
and
fears
of
an
economic
slowdown
if
crude
prices
remain
weak
it
would
be
harder
for
qep
to
get
a
competing
bid

williams
capital
group
analyst

sorbara
prices
rebounded
percent
on
monday
on
opec
production
cuts
and
steadying
equities
markets
while
its
bid
offers
a
healthy
exit
opportunity
for
current
investors
elliott
s
letter
to
the
board
is
clearly
a
preliminary
step
in
the
negotiation
process

qep

not

continues
to
trade
well
below
its

elliott
wrote
in
a
letter
addressed
to
the
board
last
year
qep
decided
to
sell
its
williston
oil
asset
in
north
dakota
montana
and
the
canadian
province
of
saskatchewan
as
well
as
the
haynesville
gas
asset
in
texas
and
louisiana
it
wanted
to
focus
solely
on
the
permian
basin
the
oilfield
that
has
been
at
the
heart
of
the
shale
boom
the
elliott
offer
is
conditional
on
closing
the
haynesville
asset
sale
but
not
on
the
closure
of
the
williston
asset
sale
