the
trump
administration
s
top
two
negotiators
in
trade
talks
with
china
will
meet
on
friday
with
chinese
president
xi
jinping
but
there
has
been
no
decision
to
extend
a
march
deadline
for
a
deal
white
house
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
said
on
thursday
the
vibe
in
beijing
is
good
kudlow
told
fox
news
channel
of
the
talks
that
are
set
to
conclude
on
friday
in
beijing
but
kudlow
s
upbeat
assessment
contrasted
with
reports
from
two
people
familiar
with
the
talks
who
said
progress
has
been
difficult
on
the
thorniest
issues
involving
demands
that
china
make
sweeping
changes
to
curb
forced
technology
transfers
and
to
enforce
intellectual
property
rights
sources
briefed
on
the
talks
also
told
reuters
that
china
had
pledged
to
make
its
industrial
subsidy
programs
compliant
with
world
trade
organization
rules
and
end
those
that
distort
markets
but
had
offered
no
details
on
how
it
intends
to
achieve
that
goal
the
offer
has
been
met
with
skepticism
from
negotiators
in
part
because
china
has
long
refused
to
disclose
its
subsidies
negotiators
from
the
two
sides
are
pushing
to
a
tariff
war
that
has
dimmed
global
growth
forecasts
roiled
financial
markets
and
disrupted
manufacturing
supply
chains
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
imports
from
china
are
scheduled
to
rise
to
percent
from
percent
if
the
two
sides
do
not
reach
a
deal
by
march
increasing
pressure
and
costs
in
sectors
from
consumer
electronics
to
agriculture
although
president
donald
trump
said
earlier
this
week
that
an
extension
of
the
deadline
was
possible
if
a
real
deal
was
close
kudlow
director
of
the
national
economic
council
said
the
white
house
had
made
no
such
decision
the
talks
scheduled
to
run
through
friday
follow
three
days
of
meetings
to
work
out
technical
details
including
a
mechanism
for
enforcing
any
trade
agreement
china
proposed
in
the
talks
this
week
to
increase
purchases
of
semiconductors
to
billion
over
six
years
as
part
of
a
deal
to
ease
american
tariffs
a
person
briefed
on
the
talks
told
reuters
but
the
semiconductor
proposal
first
reported
by
the
wall
street
journal
was
part
of
a
recycled
package
of
goods
purchase
offers
that
beijing
first
presented
in
the
spring
of
the

china
has
also
offered
to
sharply
increase
