strasbourg
reuters
the
european
commission
added
saudi
arabia
panama
and
four
territories
to
a
blacklist
of
nations
it
considers
a
threat
because
of
lax
controls
on
terrorism
financing
and
money
laundering
the
eu
executive
said
on
wednesday
the
move
is
part
of
a
crackdown
on
money
laundering
after
several
scandals
at
eu
banks
but
it
has
been
criticised
by
several
eu
countries
including
britain
that
are
worried
about
their
economic
relations
with
the
listed
states
notably
saudi
arabia
the
united
states
has
also
disapproved
the
saudi
government
said
it
regretted
the
decision
in
a
statement
published
by
the
saudi
press
agency
adding
saudi
arabia
s
commitment
to
combating
money
laundering
and
the
financing
of
terrorism
is
a
strategic
priority
panama
said
it
should
be
removed
from
the
list
because
it
recently
adopted
stronger
rules
against
money
laundering
despite
pressure
to
exclude
riyadh
from
the
list
the
commission
decided
to
list
the
kingdom
confirming
a
reuters
report
in
january
apart
from
reputational
damage
inclusion
on
the
list
complicates
financial
relations
with
the
eu
the
bloc
s
banks
will
have
to
carry
out
additional
checks
on
payments
involving
entities
from
listed
jurisdictions
the
list
now
includes
jurisdictions
up
from
the
commission
said
it
added
jurisdictions
with
strategic
deficiencies
in
their
laundering
and
countering
terrorist
financing
regimes
other
newcomers
to
the
list
are
libya
botswana
ghana
samoa
the
bahamas
and
the
four
united
states
territories
of
american
samoa
virgin
islands
puerto
rico
and
guam
the
treasury
said
the
listing
process
was
flawed
and
rejected
the
inclusion
of
the
four
territories
on
the
list
the
other
listed
states
are
afghanistan
north
korea
ethiopia
iran
iraq
pakistan
sri
lanka
syria
trinidad
and
tobago
tunisia
and
yemen
bosnia
guyana
laos
uganda
and
vanuatu
were
removed
the
eu
member
states
now
have
one
month
which
can
be
extended
to
two
to
endorse
the
list
they
could
reject
it
by
qualified
majority
eu
justice
commissioner
vera
jourova
who
proposed
the
list
told
a
news
conference
that
she
was
confident
states
would
not
block
it
she
said
it
was
urgent
to
act
because
risks
spread
like
wildfire
in
the
banking
sector
but
concerns
remain
britain
which
plans
to
leave
the
eu
on
march
said
on
wednesday
the
list
could
confuse
businesses
because
it
diverges
from
a
smaller
listing
compiled
by
its
financial
action
task
force
fatf
which
is
the
global
for
laundering
the
fatf
list
includes
jurisdictions
all
on
the
eu
blacklist
but
excludes
saudi
arabia
panama
and
territories
the
fatf
will
update
its
list
next
week
london

led
a
pushback
against
the
