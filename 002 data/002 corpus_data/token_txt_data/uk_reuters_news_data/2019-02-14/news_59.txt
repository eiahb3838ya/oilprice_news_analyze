suffered
a
fifth
consecutive

driving
the
rand
sharply
down
as
power
utility
eskom
struggles
with
coal
shortages
and
breakdowns
at
some
of
its
plants
the
firm
which
supplies
more
than
percent
of
the
power
in
africa
s
most
industrialised
economy
started
cutting
power
from
the
national
grid
on

and
intensified

on
monday
after
six
of
its
generating
units
unexpectedly
went
offline
on
wednesday
the
government
said
eskom
was
technically
insolvent
and
needed
an
urgent
bailout
to
help
it
manage
its
more
than
billion
of
debt
as
it
battles
to
keep
its
plants
running
due
to
a
shortage
of
capacity
eskom
will
implement
stage
rotational
from
gmt
today
and
is
likely
to
continue
until
eskom
said
in
a
statement
on
thursday
this
means
up
to
megawatts
of
electricity
will
be
cut
from
the
national
power
grid
on
monday
the
firm
slashed
megawatts
from
the
national
grid
the
largest
cut
since
locally
referred
to
as
the
power
cuts
are
an
emergency
measure
to
prevent
the
power
system
from
a
total
collapse
eskom
says
the
power
crisis
has
spooked
investors
just
days
before
a
national
budget
prompting

the
rand
and
government
bonds
the
rand
which
has
tumbled
percent
in
three
days
weakened
past
per
dollar
earlier
on
thursday
the
eskom
crisis
is
a
potential
threat
to
the
country
s
credit
rating
which
is
hanging
by
a
thread
with
moody
