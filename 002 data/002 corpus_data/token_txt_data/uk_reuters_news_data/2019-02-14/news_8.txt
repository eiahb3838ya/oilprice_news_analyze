frontera
energy
corp
is
reconsidering
pursuing
new
investments
in
peru
due
to
government
delays
in
fixing
a
key
pipeline
the
company
s
chief
executive
said
on
thursday
richard
herbert
added
that
frontera
might
withdraw
from
its
main
oilfield
in
the
country
if
the
pipeline
run
by
petroperu
remains
inoperative
for
several
more
months
the
old
pipeline
is
needed
to
transport
crude
from
oilfields
in
the
peruvian
amazon
including
frontera
s
block
to
the
pacific
coast
but
it
has
been
offline
since
late
november
when
petroperu
said
it
was
severed
by
members
of
an
indigenous
community
in
a
dispute
related
to
local
elections
frontera
has
lost
million
because
of
the
problem
and
is
now
producing
almost
nothing
from
block
herbert
said
petroperu
declined
to
comment
it
has
previously
said
that
the
native
community
of
mayuriaga
has
blocked
its
workers
from
fixing
the
pipeline
community
representatives
could
not
immediately
be
reached
if
we
have
to
wait
months
and
months
we
might
reach
the
point
where
we
can
t
tolerate
more
losses
herbert
told
a
news
conference
in
lima
it
s
getting
harder
and
harder
for
me
to
persuade
frontera
s
board
of
directors
to
consider
future
investments
in
the
country
when
we
have
so
many
problems
and
other
countries
are
becoming
more
attractive
herbert
said
herbert
said
frontera
plans
to
submit
a
bid
on
an
oil
block
in
ecuador
next
month
and
is
looking
at
potential
new
investments
in
colombia
peru
s
deputy
minister
of
territorial
governance
raul
molina
who
has
led
the
government
s
efforts
to
end
the
conflict
said
his
team
is
close
to
a
deal
with
local
leaders
to
open
passage
for
petroperu
to
repair
the
pipeline
we
are
absolutely
committed
to
finding
a
solution
molina
said
by
phone
he
added
that
talks
have
taken
so
long
because
the
community
has
a
long
list
of
demands
to
discuss
and
the
government
does
not
want
to
unleash
a
violent
conflict
by
breaking
the
blockade
by
force
peru
is
a
relatively
small
oil
player
in
latin
america
frontera
started
operating
peru
s
largest
oil
block
in
the
amazonian
region
of
loreto
under
a
service
contract
in
the
contract
has
been
repeatedly
extended
to
compensate
for
periods
in
which
frontera
was
unable
to
operate
due
to
problems
with
the
pipeline
and
is
now
set
to
expire
in
september
frontera
which
also
operates
a
small
offshore
oil
block
in
peru
previously
said
it
was
interested
in
a
contract
for
block
