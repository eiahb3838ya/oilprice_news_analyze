the

analysts
said
in
a
note
some
of
today
s
recovery
in
the
oil
also
appeared
to
be
related
to
some
weakening
in
the
dollar

early
strong
gains
jim
ritterbusch

associates
said
the
dollar
dropped
to
session
lows
on
thursday
morning
following
the
retail
sales
report
oil
prices
also
drew
support
from
a
surprise
increase
in
china
s
exports
in
january
and
a
sharp
rise
in
imports
of
crude
oil
before
the
lunar
new
year
holidays
in
february
however
in
physical
markets
the
steep
rise
in
availability
of
shale
oil
is
leading
to
a
build
in
domestic
inventories
of
crude
and
in
refined
products
government
data
on
wednesday
showed
crude
stocks
last

rose
to
their
highest
since
november
as
refiners
cut
runs
to
the
lowest
since
october
