iran
russia
and
kazakhstan
are
making
progress
on
organising
finance
for
a
wheat
deal
that
could
double
or
triple
supplies
to
iran
the
secretary
general
of
iran
s
federation
of
food
industry
associations
said
talks
started
a
year
ago
but
stalled
due
to
a
lack
of
financing
the
deal
involves
russia
and
kazakhstan
supplying
wheat
to
iranian
millers
who
in
turn
would
supply
flour
to
iraq
a
market
dominated
by
turkey
and
other
countries
on
tuesday
russia
kazakhstan
and
iran
signed
a
memorandum
outlining
cooperation
in
wheat
trading
it
was
part
of
wider
negotiations
on
setting
up
a
free
trade
zone
between
iran
russia
kazakhstan
and
other
neighbours
in
the
new
agreement
of
the
three
sides
it
is
mentioned
that
the
buyer
can
use
a
credit
line
opened
by
a
bank
so
funding
that
was
a
main
concern
last
year
will
be
settled
kaveh
zargaran
told
reuters
he
did
not
specify
the
banks
that
can
open
such
credit
lines
in
this
case
we
will
notice
wheat
transit
and
swaps
will
be
increasing
from
russia
and
kazakhstan
he
added
iran
was
one
of
the
largest
markets
for
russian
wheat
until
it
slashed
purchases
in
due
to
tehran
s
drive
however
iranian
private
millers
who
are
not
allowed
to
use
domestic
wheat
for
flour
exports
still
need
imported
wheat
iran
can
export
flour
produced
from
russian
wheat
to
neighbouring
iraq
and
afghanistan
zargaran
said
in
this
regard
wheat
imports
will
double

in
the
previous
marketing
