oil
traders
no
longer
expect
the
market
to
be
this
year
amid
optimism
a
trade
war
will
be
averted
and
oil
production
growth
will
slow
thanks
to
opec
cuts
and
sanctions
on
venezuela
brent
futures
prices
have
jumped
to
almost
per

up
from
just
in
late
december

the
highest
for
nearly
three
months
chartbook
brent
s
calendar
spread
has
swung
into
a
backwardation
of
almost
cents
per
barrel
from
a
contango
of
more
than
late
last
year
the
strongest
for
almost
four
months
crude
prices
and
spreads
are
being
propelled
higher
by
an
almost
perfect
storm
of
increasing
economic
optimism
or
at
least
reducing
pessimism
opec
cuts
and
unplanned
supply
disruptions
in
recent
days
senior
policymakers
from
both
the
united
states
and
china
have
signalled
trade
negotiations
are
making
good
progress
as
fear
of
recession
makes
both
sides
more
eager
for
a
deal
more
importantly
the
president
has
indicated
the
deadline
for
the
next
round
of
tariff
increases
could
be
extended
based
on
recent
progress
even
if
not
all
issues
have
been
resolved
by
march
oil
consumption
growth
is
likely
to
slow
this
year
from
the
very
rapid
rates
reported
between
and
but
if
tariff
increases
can
be
avoided
oil
use
should
continue
increasing
at
a
moderate
pace
meanwhile
saudi
arabia
and
its
closest
allies
in
opec
have
also
acted
early
and
aggressively
to
reduce
production
which
should
help
eliminate
the
incipient
surplus
in
the
market
saudi
arabia
s
oil
minister
has
said
the
kingdom
s
production
will
fall
to
just
million
barrels
per
day
in
march
from
million
in
november
saudi
arabia
goes
on
hunt
for
global
oil
and
gas
financial
times
saudi
arabia
s
willingness
to
act
as
swing
producer
has
more
than
offset
the
limited
cuts
made
by
other
members
of
the
organisation
and
its
allies
led
by
russia
the
kingdom
has
demonstrated
its
commitment
to
eliminating
the
market
surplus
and
pushing
prices
higher
even
if
it
means
tolerating
poor
compliance
by
other
members
of
the
group
at
the
same
time
iran
s
exports
remain
crimped
by
sanctions
imposed
in
november
with
the
expectation
they
will
be
lowered
further
from
may
when
sanctions
waivers
are
likely
to
become
less
generous
and
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
oil
company
pdvsa
have
reduced
the
country
s
crude
exports
and
tightened
the
global
oil
market
even
further
policymakers
probably
expected
the
venezuela
sanctions
would
have
little
impact
on
global
production
since
they
were
expected
to
result
in
the
rapid
removal
of
president
nicolas
maduro
but
with
the
maduro
administration
digging
in
for
a
long
confrontation
traders
have
been
forced
to
reappraise
the
possibility
of
a
long
disruption
of
exports
that
could
last
weeks
or
even
months
production
and
consumption
risks
concentrated
on
the
downside
at
the
start
of
the
year
have
therefore
shifted
to
the
upside
in
recent
weeks
hedge
fund
positioning
could
accelerate
the
rise
in
prices
and
shift
to
backwardation
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
held
an
overall
bullish
position
in
brent
futures
and
options
equivalent
to
just
million
barrels
at
the
start
of
february
down
from
almost
million
at
the
end
of
september
portfolio
managers
overall
bullish
position
has
already
risen
by
nearly
million
barrels
over
the
last
nine
weeks
but
remains
close
to
the
lowest
level
for
the
last
three
years
funds
hold
just
long
bullish
contracts
for
every
short
bullish
one
down
from
a
ratio
of
almost
just
over
four
months
ago
so
there
is
scope
for
more
fund
buying
production
and
consumption
fundamentals
as
well
as
hedge
fund
positioning
all
suggest
the
balance
of
risks
in
oil
has
shifted
to
the
upside
but
only
if
trade
talks
are
successful
or
extended
and
recession
is
avoided
