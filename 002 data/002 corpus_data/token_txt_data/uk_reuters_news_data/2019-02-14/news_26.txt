the
steepest
decline

erased
broad
gains
in
world
stock
markets
on
thursday
and
pushed
investors
into
the
safety
of

the
drop
in
retail
spending
in
the
world
s
largest
economy
heightened
investor
fears
of
a
global
slowdown
any
optimism
was
further
dimmed
by
data
released
on
thursday
showing
an
unexpected
increase
in
the
number
of
americans
filing
claims
for
unemployment
benefits
last
week
that
pushed
the
moving
average
of
claims
to
a
high
an
indication
that
job
growth
was
flattening
the
numbers
were
a
bit
of
a
surprise
on
the
downside
and
that
is
critical
because
this
is
for
december

it
suggests
that
people

the
euro
fell
near
a
low
as
data
showed
germany
s
economy
stalled
in
the
fourth
quarter
with
fallout
from
global
trade
disputes
and
brexit
threatening
to
derail
a
expansion
in
europe
s
economic
powerhouse
that
left
the
dollar
near
its
highest
since

price
to
yield
percent
from

late
on
wednesday
russian
stocks
and
bonds
were
also
dumped
as
a
rare
bipartisan
move
from
lawmakers
proposed
stiff
new
sanctions
on
russian
government
debt
as
well
as
some
banks
and
oil
and
gas
firms
on
china
president
donald

said
on
wednesday
trade
talks
were
going
along
very
well

for
higher
tariffs
on
chinese

by

it
would
cut
crude
exports
and
deliver
an
even
deeper

to
healthy

we
see
the

tightening
further
over
the
coming
months

such
we
continue
to
expect
