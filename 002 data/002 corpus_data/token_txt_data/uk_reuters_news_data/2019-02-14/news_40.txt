president
cyril
ramaphosa
said
on
thursday
that
his
government
s
plan
to
split
struggling
state
power
firm
eskom
into
three
entities
would
reduce
risks
to
the
economy
by
enabling
better
regulatory
oversight
and
increasing
competition
restructuring
will
reduce
the
risk
of
a
massive
eskom
that
at
times
has
been
termed
too
big
to
fail
placing
government
in
a
position
where
all
our
eggs
are
in
one
basket

it
is
not
a
path
to
privatisation
he
added
promising
that
a
financial
support
package
for
eskom
would
be
accompanied
by
a
turnaround
plan

would
hold
consultations
with
