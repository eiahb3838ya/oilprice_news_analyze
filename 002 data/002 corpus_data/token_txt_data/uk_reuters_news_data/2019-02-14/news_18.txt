update 3-eskom split to minimise risks to south africa, ramaphosa says
town
reuters
south
african
president
cyril
ramaphosa
said
his
plan
to
divide
struggling
state
power
firm
eskom
into
three
units
would
minimize
risks
to
the
economy
as
a
fifth
day
of
power
cuts
hurt
businesses
and
drove
the
rand
to
a
low
on
thursday
eskom
which
supplies
more
than
percent
of
the
power
in
africa
s
most
industrialized
economy
is
technically
insolvent
the
government
said
on
wednesday
warning
that
an
urgent
bailout
was
needed
to
help
it
manage
its
billion
debt
restructuring
will
reduce
the
risk
of
a
massive
eskom
that
at
times
has
been
termed
too
big
to
fail
placing
government
in
a
position
where
all
our
eggs
are
in
one
basket
ramaphosa
said
in
a
speech
to
parliament
it
is
not
a
path
to
privatization
he
added
promising
that
a
financial
support
package
for
eskom
would
be
accompanied
by
a
turnaround
plan
and
that
officials
would
consult
with
trade
unions
which
have
expressed
anger
at
the
proposed
split
last
week
ramaphosa
who
faces
a
parliamentary
election
in
may
pledged
to
separate
eskom
into
units
for
generation
transmission
and
distribution
to
increase
efficiency
and
prop
up
the
country
s
most
important
state
company
the
former
union
leader
is
under
pressure
to
revive
an
economy
that
stagnated
under
his
predecessor
jacob
zuma
and
the
eskom
crisis
will
test
his
negotiating
skills
with
his
eskom
cut
megawatts
mw
of
electricity
from
the
grid
from
gmt
on
thursday
likely
until
gmt
that
is
an
improvement
from
monday
when
it
slashed
mw
from
the
grid
in
its
largest
cut
since
because
of
unplanned
breakdowns
of
some
generating
units
maintenance
and
diesel
shortages
a
senior
eskom
official
andrew
etzinger
said
on
thursday
that
eskom
s
plant
performance
and
diesel
supplies
had
improved
substantially
and
that
its
coal
stockpiles
were
approaching
their
highest
in
around
six
months
that
bodes
well
for
next
week
by
which
time
eskom
hopes
to
have
ended
the
power
cuts
which
are
an
emergency
measure
to
prevent
the
electricity
system
from
a
total
collapse
around
a
third
of
eskom
s
mw
capacity
is
still
offline
the
outages
the
worst
in
several
years
have
spooked
investors
days
before
a
budget
speech
by
the
finance
minister
and
have
prompted
a
sharp
slide
in
the
rand
and
government
bonds
the
rand
fell
more
than
percent
versus
the
dollar
to
its
weakest
in
six
weeks
on
thursday
and
is
now
down
more
than
percent
this
week
the
cuts
have
left
ordinary
south
africans
struggling
to
feed
their
families
and
caused
traffic
gridlock
in
major
cities
as
traffic
lights
stop
working
if
the
power
goes
off
for
more
than
six
hours
and
we
have
to
run
the
generators
for
that
long
it
s
going
to
be
very
expensive
we
re
not
going
to
be
able
to
afford
the
diesel
said
arno
steenkamp
a
manager
at
a
johannesburg
restaurant
if
we
can
t
make
coffee
and
food
it
s
going
to
hit
our
sales
and
we
might
have
to
close
he
added
firms
in
the
mining
sector
the
backbone
of
the
country
s
economy
are
looking
at
alternatives
to
reduce
their
dependence
on
eskom
and
monitoring
the
situation
closely
eskom
s
woes
which
reflect
the
failure
of
successive
governments
to
take
on
labor
unions
and
tackle
eskom
s
monopolistic
structure

a
potential
threat

the

is
also
the
risk
that

go
on

the

mineworkers
num
the
biggest
union
at
eskom
on
thursday
warned
ramaphosa
s
african

congress
anc
not

hold
talks
with

minister
pravin
gordhan
on
monday
to
express
their
disagreement
with
the
plan
to
split
eskom
which
the
union
fears
will
lead
to
massive
job
losses
further
down
the
line
ramaphosa
said
in

that
at
eskom
would
not
necessarily
entail
job
cuts
