brazil mills likely to delay cane harvest due to weather, ethanol stocks

mills
in
brazil
s
are
likely
to
start
harvesting
the
new
sugar
cane
crop
later
than
usual
to
allow
cane
fields
to
take
advantage
of
late
rains
while
holding
excess
ethanol
stocks
after
last
year
analysts
and
millers
said
brazil
s
cane
crop
in
the
main
region
officially
starts
in
april
but
mills
normally
enter
fields
in
march
particularly
to
profit
from
better
ethanol
prices
at
the
end
of
the
period
ethanol
stocks
in
the
region
are
still
at
a
high
however
because
of
the
mills
strategy
last
year
to
favor
the
biofuel
over
sugar
ethanol
prices
did
not
rise
in
the
period
as
they
historically
do
further
reducing
the
incentive
for
early
harvesting
brazil
s
sao
martinho
one
of
the
largest
companies
in
the
sector
said
around
percent
of
its
annual
ethanol
output
remains
to
be
sold
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
crop
year
which
runs
from
january
to
march
our
expectation
was
for
higher
ethanol
prices
in
december
january
and
february
which
didn
t
happen
said
felipe
vicchiato
the
company
s
chief
financial
officer
brazil
is
the
world
s
largest
producer
and
exporter
of
sugar
and
the
largest
producer
of
ethanol
though
it
is
second
overall
after
the
united
states
which
makes
its
ethanol

fcstone
also
said
brazil
s
ethanol
stocks
remain
high
if
mills
face
difficulties
to
reduce
those
stocks
they
could
opt
to
produce
more
sugar
than
ethanol
in
the
beginning
of
the
new
crop
or
they
could
choose
to
delay
the
start
of
harvesting
he
said
some
companies
such
as
louis
biosev
want
to
give
cane
fields
time
to
benefit
from
recent
rains
especially
since
precipitation
was
below
average
in
december
and
january
we
are
having
good
rains
now
and
there
is
more
expected
for
the
rest
of
the
month
our
plan
is
to
not
start
crushing
in
march
only
in
april
biosev
s
chief
executive
juan
josé
blanchard
told
reuters
if
rains
continue
into
march
overall
volumes
for
the
new
cane
crop
could
improve
even
if
mills
delay
processing
some
analysts
think
the
sugar
market
is
already
reacting
to
a
possible
delay
in
the
new
crop
the
spread
in
new
york
appreciated
almost
in
the
last
two
weeks
what
causes
such
a
movement
is
the
perception
of
a
delay
in
the
availability
of
sugar
in
the
beginning
of
the
crop
