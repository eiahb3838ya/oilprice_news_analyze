warsaw
reuters
vice
president
mike
pence
accused
washington
s
european
allies
on
thursday
of
trying
to
break
sanctions
against
tehran
and
called
on
them
to
withdraw
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
sadly
some
of
our
leading
european
partners
have
not
been
nearly
as
cooperative
in
fact
they
have
led
the
effort
to
create
mechanisms
to
break
up
our
sanctions
pence
said
during
a
conference
on
the
middle
east
organised
by
the
united
states
in
warsaw
pence
said
a
scheme
set
up
by
the
eu
to
facilitate
trade
with
iran
was
an
effort
to
break
american
sanctions
against
iran
s
murderous
revolutionary
regime
it
is
an
step
that
will
only
strengthen
iran
weaken
the
eu
and
create
still
more
distance
between
europe
and
the
united
states
he
said
the
warsaw
meeting
was
attended
by
more
than
nations
but
major
european
powers
such
as
germany
and
france
part
to
the
nuclear
accord
refused
to
send
their
top
diplomats
