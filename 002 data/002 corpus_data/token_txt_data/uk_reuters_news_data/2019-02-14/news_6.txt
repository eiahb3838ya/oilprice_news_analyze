close
two
aging
power
plants

supplied
by
a
company
led
by
a
major
supporter
of
president
donald
trump
who
had
urged
the
utility
to
keep
it
open
it
is
not
about
coal
this
decision
is
about
economics
said
president
and
chief
executive
bill
johnson
who
is
retiring
from
the
tva
it
s
about
keeping
rates
as
low
as
ahead
of
the
vote
johnson
had
said
the
plants
which
operated
only
sporadically
in
recent
years
had
become
too
expensive
to
operate
and
that
closing
them
would
save
customers
million
the
board
voted
to
approve
the
closures
the
members
who
voted
to
keep
them
open
were
both
appointed
by
trump
the
bull

coal
plant
in
tennessee
will
close
by
december
and
the
paradise
plant
in
kentucky
will
be
shut
by
december
both
are
about
years
old
johnson
told
reuters
in
december
that
tva
will
keep
cutting
carbon
emissions
in
future
years
after
replacing
much
of
its
fleet
with
plants
run
on
natural
gas
nuclear
and
renewables
paradise
which
entered
service
in
was
mostly
supplied
with
coal
last
year
by
murray
energy
chaired
by
robert
murray
a
donor
to
trump
s
presidential
campaign
in
and
a
frequent
attendee
at
events
held
by
the
administration
early
in
the
trump
presidency
murray
had
presented
the
administration
with
a
wish
list
of
environmental
regulations
he
wanted
slashed
trump
whose
base
is
partly
made
up
of
voters
in
coal
country
has
prioritized
rolling
back
environmental
regulations
and
opening
up
lands
to
mining
and
drilling
the
president
had
urged
the
tva
in
a
message
on
twitter
on
monday
to
consider
the
role
of
coal
in
the
electric
grid
before
voting
his
administration
s
efforts
to
save
coal
plants
with
proposals
to
subsidize
them
have
not
been
successful
more
coal
plants
were
shut
in
trump
s
first
two
years
than
were
retired
in
the
entire
first
term
of
former
president
barack
obama
the
white
house
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
in
total
more
than
mw
of
generation
were
shut
in
versus
mw
in
according
to
data
from
reuters
and
the
energy
information
administration
eia
on
tuesday
the
eia
said
it
expected
coal
s
contribution
to
the
power
mix
to
keep
falling
in
coming
years
this
year
it
should
average
percent
of
generation
down
from
percent
in
and
is
set
to
fall
to
percent
by
by
contrast
natural
power
plants
will
account
for
percent
and
percent
of
that
generation
respectively
in
and
up
from
percent
last
year
agencies
moody
s
investors
service
and
s
p
global
both
said
the
closure
of
the
kentucky
plant
was
a
modest
credit
risk
for
murray
energy
at
most
you
can
surmise
that
the
coal
produced
for
paradise
is
not
a
huge
amount
of
their
production
said
benjamin
nelson
senior
credit
officer
at
moody
s
nevertheless
the
decline
of
the
coal
industry
has
led
both
agencies
to
incorporate
the
closure
of
plants
into
their
credit
ratings
for
murray
energy
which
currently
stand
at
by
moody
s
and
by
s
p
a
distressed
debt
exchange
worth
billion
between
the
company
and
its
bondholders
in
june
was
labeled
by
moody
s
as
a
limited
default
and
called
tantamount
to
default
by
s
p
a
deal
later
in
the
summer
to
refinance
some
of
the
company
s
debt
which
now
stands
at
million
of
bonds
outstanding
has
helped
improve
the
company
s
outlook
murray
said
he
was
extremely
disappointed
in
the
tva
decision
as
his
company
has
employees
near
the
plant
who
face
an
uncertain
future
