sunpower seeking partner for its solar panel making business
reuters
sunpower
corp
is
seeking
a
strategic
partner
for
its
solar
panel
manufacturing
business
an
arrangement
that
could
allow
it
to
expand
the
factory
it
acquired
last
year
chief
executive
tom
werner
said
on
wednesday
a
partnership
could
involve
the
sale
of
a
minority
stake
in
the
manufacturing
business
or
a
customer
investment
that
would
allow
preferential
access
to
its
products
among
other
options
werner
said
the
investment
would
allow
sunpower
to
accelerate
deployment
of
its
solar
technology
and
could
allow
it
to
do
more
at
the
hillsboro
oregon
factory
that
it
acquired
last
year
as
it
sought
to
stem
the
impact
of
trump
administration
tariffs
on
panels
sunpower
makes
most
of
its
products
overseas
but
bought
the
oregon
factory
last
year
at
the
same
time
it
was
seeking
an
exemption
from
the
percent
tariffs
which
it
was
ultimately
granted
we
are
out
fundraising
looking
for
strategic
partners
and
depending
on
the
degree
of
success
of
that
hillsboro
could
stay
the
same
or
expand
faster
werner
said
in
an
interview
sunpower
which
is
based
in
san
jose
california
but
is
majority
owned
by
france
s
total
has
about
employees
at
the
facility
in
oregon
the
company
s
panels
are
among
the
most
efficient
in
the
industry
at
transforming
sunlight
into
electricity
but
prices
on
solar
modules
are
falling
rapidly
and
manufacturers
must
keep
investing
in
their
technology
to
stay
competitive
this
is
particularly
true
for
companies
producing
panels
in
the
united
states
where
costs
are
higher
we
have
to
keep
investing
and
keep
pushing
the
technology
werner
said
things
are
changing
rapidly
in
solar
and
we
know
that
rapidly
means
more
aggressive
pricing
and
incremental
efficiency
other
solar
panel
producers
including
jinkosolar
lg
and
hanwha
q
cells
have
made
similar
investments
in
factories
that
will
ramp
up
this
year
sunpower
has
restructured
its
business
over
the
last
two
years
to
reduce
debt
and
cut
costs
its
two
key
segments
north
american
residential
and
commercial
solar
and
panel
manufacturing
and
overseas
installation
activities
now
operate
largely
independently
the
company
said
on
wednesday
that
its
financial
performance
would
improve
throughout
due
to
record
commercial
bookings
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
last
year
the
company
will
also
benefit
this
year
from
its
exemption
from
the
tariffs
