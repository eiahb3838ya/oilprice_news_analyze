explainer-what's at stake in u.s.-china trade talks
washington
reuters
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
and
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
are
in
beijing
this
week
as
chinese
and
american
negotiators
try
to
hammer
out
a
trade
deal
to
ease
a
trade
war
and
avert
an
increase
in
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
scheduled
for
march
the
governments
of
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
have
been
locked
in
a
tariff
battle
for
months
as
washington
presses
beijing
to
address
concerns
over
chinese
practices
and
policies
around
industrial
subsidies
market
access
and
intellectual
property
rights
protections
here
is
a
look
at
the
key
issues
in
the
talks
and
their
implications
after
years
of
steadily
rising
trade
deficits
with
china
and
complaints
that
beijing
has
systematically
obtained
american
intellectual
property
and
trade
secrets
through
coercion
and
outright
theft
the
trump
administration
last
year
demanded
fundamental
changes
to
china
s
economic
model
to
allow
companies
to
compete
on
a
more
level
playing
field
these
include
an
end
to
policies
that
washington
claims
effectively
force
companies
to
transfer
their
technologies
to
chinese
partners
and
full
protection
for
american
intellectual
property
rights
at
the
most
basic
level
a
dominant
position
in
future
industries
according
to
the
trade
representative
s
office
china
is
determined
to
upgrade
its
industrial
base
in
strategic
sectors
by
including
aerospace
robotics
semiconductors
artificial
intelligence
and
vehicles
officials
say
they
do
not
have
a
problem
with
china
moving
up
the
technology
ladder
but
they
do
not
want
it
to
happen
with
stolen
or
unfairly
obtained
american
they
argue
that
china
s
massive
support
for
enterprises
is
leading
to
overproduction
making
it
hard
for
companies
to
compete
on
a
basis
chinese
officials
generally
view
the
actions
as
a
broad
effort
to
thwart
the
asian
country
s
inevitable
rise
to
a
dominant
position
in
the
global
economy
they
deny
that
china
requires
or
coerces
technology
transfers
saying
that
any
such
actions
are
commercial
transactions
between
american
and
chinese
firms
at
the
same
time
china
is
looking
to
make
a
deal
with
president
donald
trump
to
ease
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
and
to
directly
reduce
the
trade
imbalance
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
through
increased
purchases
of
goods
including
soybeans
and
energy
beijing
has
also
taken
some
steps
to
open
up
to
more
imports
including
lowering
tariffs
on
imported
cars
and
allowing
foreign
companies
in
some
sectors
to
own
a
majority
of
their
operations
in
china
trump
has
imposed
punitive
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
imported
goods
from
china
so
far
a
percent
duty
on
billion
worth
of
machinery
semiconductors
and
other
products
and
percent
tariffs
on
a
broader
billion
range
of
goods
that
includes
many
chemicals
building
materials
furniture
and
some
consumer
electronics
thus
far
trump
has
spared
many
consumer
goods
including
cellphones
computers
clothing
and
footwear
from
tariffs
but
if
no
deal
is
reached
by
march
the
united
states
is
scheduled
to
raise
tariffs
on
the
billion
in
goods
from
china
to
percent
from
percent
trump
said
on
wednesday
that
a
delay
was
possible
yes
china
has
imposed
tariffs
of
percent
on
billion
worth
of
goods
including
soybeans
beef
pork
seafood
whiskey
ethanol
and
motor
vehicles
beijing
also
has
imposed
tariffs
of
percent
to
percent
on
another
billion
worth
of
goods
including
liquefied
natural
gas
chemicals
frozen
vegetables
and
food
ingredients
so
far
beijing
has
spared
imports
of
commercial
aircraft
largely
made
by
boeing
co
since
trump
and
chinese
president
xi
jinping
agreed
in
december
to
pursue
the
current
round
of
talks
china
has
also
suspended
tariffs
on
autos
and
has
resumed
some
purchases
of
soybeans
china
has
pledged
to
make
its
industrial
subsidy
programs
compliant
with
world
trade
organization
rules
and
nondistortive
to
markets
but
has
offered
no
details
on
how
it
will
achieve
this
sources
told
reuters
it
s
unclear
if
that
will
be
enough
to
satisfy
negotiators
but
that
indicates
china
may
be
willing
to
address
those
american
concerns
the
two
sides
seemed
far
apart
on
industrial
subsidies
and
forced
technology
transfer
when
they
met
in
late
january
though
they
indicated
some
progress
had
been
made
around
intellectual
property
rights
issues
a
key
demand
is
creating
a
mechanism
for
regular
reviews
of
china
s
progress
on
following
through
on
any
reform
pledges
that
it
makes
a
plan
that
would
maintain
a
perpetual
threat
of
tariffs
china
has
also
offered
to
make
purchases
of
over
trillion
worth
of
goods
over
the
next
six
years
including
of
agricultural
and
energy
products
as
well
as
industrial
goods
will
officials
accept
a
deal
based
mainly
on
purchases
trump
has
been
optimistic
about
a
deal
saying
on
wednesday
that
the
talks
were
going
very
well
but
he
indicated
in
his
state
of
the
union
address
on
that
big
spending
by
china
on
american
goods
would
not
be
enough
for
a
deal
any
new
trade
deal
with
china
must
include
real
structural
change
to
end
unfair
trade
practices
reduce
our
chronic
trade
deficit
and
protect
american
jobs
he
said
in
the
address
the
president
s
advisers
say
he
will
not
soften
his
demands
that
china
make
structural
reforms
on
intellectual
property
and
related
issues
the
united
states
rebuffed
some
initial
offers
by
china
last
spring
to
increase
purchases
of
goods
choosing
instead
to
proceed
with
tariffs
the
two
sides
could
report
some
progress
toward
a
deal
and
may
extend
the
march
deadline
to
keep
negotiating
as
often
happened
during
talks
last
year
to
replace
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
or
nafta
a
stalemate
on
core
structural
issues
would
be
viewed
as
a
negative
sign
and
investors
would
brace
for
higher
tariffs
trade
negotiations
often
go
down
to
the
wire
so
a
final
outcome
is
not
likely
before
the
end
of
february
and
any
agreement
will
need
the
approval
of
trump
and
xi
the
two
presidents
have
no
meeting
planned
before
the
march
deadline
