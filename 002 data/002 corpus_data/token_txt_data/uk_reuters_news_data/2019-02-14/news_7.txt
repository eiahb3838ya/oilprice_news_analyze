wrapup 2-venezuela's maduro ramps up legal fight against guaido's challenge
reuters
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
s
government
stepped
up
a
legal
battle
against
efforts
to
oust
him
on
thursday
while
the
opposition
said
the
international
community
had
pledged
more
than
million
in
humanitarian
aid
for
the
country
venezuela
s
opposition
which
argues
maduro
s
presidency
is
illegitimate
because
he
won
in
a
sham
vote
is
trying
to
wrest
control
of
the
opec
nation
s
oil
sector
from
him
and
deliver
aid
to
a
population
suffering
food
and
medicine
shortages
maduro
says
this
is
part
of
a
strategy
to
carry
out
a
coup
and
has
vowed
to
remain
in
office
despite
around
nations
recognising
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
as
president
maduro
retains
the
backing
of
key
allies
russia
and
china
as
well
as
control
of
venezuelan
state
institutions
including
the
military
venezuela
s
chief
state
prosecutor
tarek
saab
said
on
thursday
his
office
had
opened
an
investigation
into
new
directors
at
oil
firm
pdvsa
and
its
refiner
citgo
venezuela
s
most
valuable
foreign
asset
the
supreme
court
then
ruled
that
the
proposed
board
members
were
prohibited
from
leaving
the
country
at
least
some
of
the
people
are
believed
to
already
be
outside
venezuela
saab
said
guaido
had
grotesquely
made
appointments
in
order
to
please
foreign
interests
and
destabilise
the
country
the
only
directors
legitimately
appointed
to
the
boards
of
pdvsa
and
its
subsidiaries
are
those
who
have
been
appointed
by
the
executive
saab
said
according
to
his
office
s
twitter
account
as
head
of
the
national
assembly
guaido
invoked
constitutional
provisions
last
month
to
assume
the
interim
presidency
the
transitional
government
should
include
members
of
the
ruling
chavismo
movement
and
military
leadership
in
an
effort
to
guarantee
stability
for
new
elections
a
top
opposition
lawmaker
said
that
interim
government
would
have
months
to
hold
fresh
presidential
elections
from
the
date
maduro
officially
steps
down
as
president
stalin
gonzalez
the
second
vice
president
of
the
congress
told
reuters
we
need
to
give
space
to
sectors
of
chavismo
that
are
not
maduro
because
we
need
political
stability
gonzalez
said
in
an
interview
the
opposition
made
up
of
a
coalition
of
parties
plans
to
hold
primaries
in
order
to
put
forward
a
sole
candidate
for
the
presidential
elections
he
added
chavismo
is
the
movement
founded
by
former
president
hugo
chavez
who
maduro
succeeded
following
chavez
death
in
from
cancer
guaido
s
representative
carlos
vecchio
spoke
to
an
aid
conference
on
thursday
hosted
at
the
organization
of
american
states
oas
headquarters
in
washington
to
urge
the
international
community
to
help
get
assistance
into
venezuela
vecchio
and
his
aides
estimated
they
had
received
pledges
of
more
than
million
in
humanitarian
assistance
from
the
united
states
and
others
including
previous
commitments
as
well
as
new
ones
made
at
the
conference
we
must
open
thousands
of
windows
to
bring
humanitarian
aid
to
venezuela
vecchio
told
the
conference
which
was
attended
by
diplomats
and
representatives
from
dozens
of
countries
elliott
abrams
washington
s
special
representative
on
venezuela
said
the
united
states
was
looking
for
ways
to
send
in
aid
as
he
reiterated
support
for
guaido
i
can
assure
you
that
there
will
be
more
assistance
coming
in
the
future
abrams
said
without
giving
specifics
guaido
has
said
humanitarian
aid
will
enter
the
country
on
setting
the
stage
for
a
showdown
with
maduro
who
has
said
it
is
not
needed
and
should
not
be
let
in
guaido
s
declaration
was
absolutely
absurd
as
he
had
control
of
nothing
venezuelan
foreign
minister
jorge
arreaza
said
on
thursday
in
venezuela
there
s
only
one
government
the
government
of
president
maduro
so
no
one
can
give
deadlines
especially
this
man
arreaza
told
reporters
at
the
united
nations
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
has
said
it
wants
a
peaceful
resolution
to
the
crisis
but
has
refused
to
rule
out
military
intervention
cuba
accused
the
united
states
on
thursday
of
moving
special
forces
closer
to
venezuela
as
part
of

military
aircraft

the
united

had
flown
to
strategically
located
caribbean
islands
last
week

said
it
s
a
new
lie
