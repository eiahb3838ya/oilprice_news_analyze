adequate
power
she
said
kengen
has
shifted
its
strategy
in
recent
years
to
focus
on
renewable
energy
in
order
to
reduce
the
risk
posed
by
its
hydro
generation
dams

are
normally
susceptible
to
a
drop
in
production
when
the
rains
fail

paid

drought
associated
with
the
costs
of
building

geothermal

installing
additional
capacity
in

said
shareholders
might
secure
additional
dividends
in
the
future
the
outlook
is
positive
because
we
have
projects
that
we
are
implementing
that
will
increase
our
business

hope
that
the
