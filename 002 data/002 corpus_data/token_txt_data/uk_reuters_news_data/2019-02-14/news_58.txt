struggling
power
firm
eskom
subjected
south
africa
to
the
worst
power
cuts
in
several
years
this
week
after
a
decade
of
missteps
when
electricity
sales
stagnated
and
costs
soared
the
outages
expose
the
risks
to
africa
s
most
industrialised
economy
from
eskom
s
virtual
monopoly
and
the
failure
of
successive
governments
to
take
on
labour
unions
and
leftists
in
the
ruling
african
national
congress
anc
who
oppose
change
president
cyril
ramaphosa
appointed
a
new
board
at
eskom
in
and
plans
to
split
the
utility
which
expects
to
lose
about
billion
rand
billion
this
year
and
next
it
doesn
t
even
earn
enough
to
service
its
mountain
of
debt
analysts
say
bolder
steps
not
just
a
break
up
are
needed
to
rescue
a
firm
that
supplies
percent
of
the
nation
s
power
but
south
african
officials
have
ruled
out
selling
eskom
and
more
borrowing
will
only
bury
the
company
deeper
in
debt
which
leaves
it
up
to
the
government
to
step
in
with
a
bailout
below
are
the
challenges
eskom
faces
and
possible
solutions
eskom
s
power
station
performance
has
deteriorated
steeply
in
part
because
of
delays
to
critical
maintenance
work
this
week
around
a
third
of
eskom
s
megawatt
mw
installed
capacity
was
out
of
service
because
of
problems
diesel
shortages
and
planned
maintenance
eskom
has
a
plan
to
improve
performance
such
as
overhauling
units
that
have
been
shut
down
for
long
periods
and
fixing
design
flaws
at
two
major
power
projects
medupi
and
kusile
the
aim
is
to
lift
the
energy
availability
factor
or
the
level
at
which
capacity
can
be
used
to
percent
by
late
from
below
percent
now
but
neglect
means
there
are
no
quick
fixes
it
will
take
years
to
sort
out
the
problems
that
have
built
up
said
chris
yelland
a
energy
analyst
more
than
percent
of
eskom
s
power
is
produced
from
coal
dug
from
south
african
mines
but
spending
on
primary
energy
mostly
coal
has
more
than
quadrupled
in
the
past
decade
reaching
billion
rand
in
the
year
to
march
it
has
also
faced
supply
shortages
eskom
s
coal
procurement
needs
to
be
sorted
out
with
people
brought
in
who
understand
mines
and
the
quality
of
coal
is
still
a
big
problem
said
xavier
prevost
a
senior
analyst
at
xmp
consulting
eskom
s
new
management
acknowledges
its
finances
have
been
hurt
by
fraud
and
corruption
and
says
it
has
investigated
hundreds
of
instances
of
alleged
wrongdoing
eskom
s
supply
problems
were
compounded
by
its
decision
to
reduce
investment
in
mines
where
it
contributes
to
costs
and
receives
a
guaranteed
volume
and
quality
of
coal
eskom
s
new
management
has
reversed
that
policy
pledging
to
invest
up
to
billion
rand
in
mines
in
the
next
five
years
it
has
also
signed
more
than
coal
supply
contracts
eskom
employs
people
after
hiring
about
additional
employees
in
the
past
decade
a
world
bank
research
report
published
in
said
of
employees
weren
t
needed
cutting
jobs
will
be
politically
difficult
for
ramaphosa
before
this
year
s
election
when
he
will
have
to
rely
on
unions
allied
to
the
anc
if
he
wants
to
a
decisive
mandate
but
analysts
say
it
is
a
case
of
when
not
if
jobs
will
go
eskom
has
trimmed
its
executive
management
from
people
to
nine
by
combining
roles
eskom
executives
have
also
told
investors
they
hope
to
gradually
reduce
staff
numbers
by
a
third
one
investor
has
told
reuters
eskom
s
debt
pile
which
stood
at
billion
rand
at
the
end
of
september
is
perhaps
its
greatest
challenge
eskom
has
been
assigned
a
credit
rating
from
s
p
global
of
deep
into
junk
territory
the
debt
was
largely
racked
up
to
build
medupi
and
kusile
two
of
the
largest
power
stations
in
the
world
which
have
suffered
massive
cost
overruns
analysts
say
eskom
needs
a
bailout
a
tough
call
for
the
government
when
its
sovereign
credit
ratings
are
under
pressure
last
year
eskom
chairman
jabu
mabuza
urged
the
government
to
take
on
billion
rand
of
the
utility
s
debt
ramaphosa
was
initially
cool
on
the
idea
but
has
since
said
the
government
would
unveil
measures
to
support
eskom
s
balance
sheet
in
a
budget
speech
on
nedbank
cib
analysts
estimate
a
bailout
of
billion
rand
would
be
required
to
cover
eskom
s
liquidity
shortfall
while
billion
rand
would
put
it
on
a
more
sustainable
path
eskom
has
eroded
its
capital
base
by
selling
power
for
many
years
below
production
costs
that
remains
the
case
even
though
average
power
prices
have
risen
about
fourfold
since
the
world
bank
s
report
found
south
africa
had
some
of
the
lowest
electricity
tariffs
on
the
continent
eskom
has
applied
to
energy
regulator
nersa
for
tariff
increases
of
percent
in
percent
in
and
percent
in
but
nersa
tends
to
grant
much
smaller
increases
than
eskom
demands
nersa
will
respond
to
the
latest
requests
by
ramaphosa
wants
to
split
eskom
into
entities
responsible
for
generation
transmission
and
distribution
although
they
would
still
operate
under
the
same
eskom
holding
company
analysts
say
that
doesn
t
go
far
enough
separating
within
eskom
means
the
incentive
issues
and
monopoly
mindset
will
remain
and
any
upside
from
internal
capital
allocation
being
more
transparent
within
entities
may
be
limited
said
peter
attard
montalto
head
of
capital
markets
research
at
intellidex
one
option
would
be
to
remove
the
holding
structure
and
make
the
public
enterprises
ministry
the
shareholder
of
all
three
making
each
unit
function
more
independently
another
would
be
to
break
up
the
generation
business
into
several
smaller
companies
owning
a
mix
of
old
and
new
power
stations
which
would
compete
with
independent
power
producers
to
supply
the
cheapest
electricity
to
the
grid
eskom
is
responsible
for
distribution
in
some
areas
of
south
africa
while
municipal
distributors
are
responsible
in
others
and
all
of
them
face
problems
collecting
payments
eskom
is
owed
more
than
billion
rand
by
municipalities
and
customers
in
the
sprawling
soweto
township
on
the
outskirts
of
johannesburg
a
debt
which
continues
to
grow
municipalities
are
dragging
eskom
down
analyst
yelland
said
the
distribution
sector
needs
to
be
rationalised
into
a
much
smaller
set
of
efficient
viable
rand
