capacity
which
will
put
the
tiny
state
on
a
par
with
top
energy
exporters
in
an
apparent
show
of
strength
amid
a
protracted
political
row
with
gulf
neighbours
qatar
is
one
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
smallest
producers
but
is
also
one
of
the
most
influential
players
in
the
global
lng
market
due
to
its
massive
output
capacity
and
gas
reserves
qatar
petroleum
qp
the
world
s
top
supplier
of
lng
said
it
was
adding
a
fourth
lng
production
line
to
raise
its
output
capacity
from
the
north
field
to
million
tonnes
a
year
this
is
an
increase
of
around
percent
from
its
current
production
capacity
of
million
tonnes
a
year
based
on
the
good
results
obtained
through
recent
additional
appraisal
and
testing
we
have
decided
to
add
a
fourth

said
in
a
statement
this
will

a

per
day
while
saudi
arabia
the
world
s
top
oil
exporter
produces
about
million
bpd
of
crude
the
timeframe
for
completion
to
reach
the
new
capacity
is
expected
by
the
end
of
or
early
according
to
a
source
familiar
with
the
project
execution
additional
gas
volumes
available
for

will
mean
more
revenue
for
the
state
budget
and
more
cash
for
qatar

the
country

sovereign
wealth
fund
to
invest
abroad
the
source
said
the
budget
surplus
will
increase
significantly
reaching
almost
billion
qatari
riyals
in
this
would
more
than
cover
the
estimated
external
debt
the
source
said
for
qatar
which
is
locked
in
a
dispute
with
four
arab
states
broadening
its
investments
outside
the
middle
east
would
cement
its
position
as
the
world
s
largest
lng
supplier
and
help
it
to
weather
the
boycott
with
its
neighbors
in
june
last
year
saudi
arabia
the
united
arab
emirates
bahrain
and
egypt
cut
diplomatic
economic
and
transport
ties
with
qatar
accusing
it
of
backing
terrorism
a
charge
which
doha
denies
last
year
qp
said
it
was
planning
to
develop
additional
gas
from
the
north

and
build
three
new

hinting
at
a

with

for
the
new

a
decision
on
the
foreign
partners
by
the
end
of
qp

ceo
had
said
in
april
last
year
qatar
lifted
a
ban
on
the
development
of
the
north
field
the
world
s
biggest
natural
gas
field
which
it
shares
with
iran
last
year
and
announced
a

project
to
develop
its
southern
section
increasing
output
in
five
to
seven
years
the
decision
to
boost
its
lng

capacity
came
after
qatar
was
in

to
supply

to
saudi
arabia
and
increase

qp

ceo
told

in
addition
to
approximately

in
the
statement
since
qatar
announced
its
initial
plan
the

environment
has
improved
forecasts
of

have
grown
stronger
particularly
in
