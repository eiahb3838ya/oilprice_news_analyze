reuters
president
donald
trump
said
on
wednesday
he
wanted
a
solution
to
resolve
the
conflict
the
clearest
expression
yet
of
his
administration
s
support
for
such
an
outcome
the
trump
administration
has
said
in
the
past
it
would
support
a
solution
if
both
sides
agreed
to
it
trump
also
said
in
a
meeting
with
israeli
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
he
wanted
to
unveil
a
peace
plan
in
the
next
two
to
three
months
i
like
a
solution
that
s
what
i
think
works
best
that
s
my
feeling
trump
said
netanyahu
has
said
any
future
palestinian
state
must
be
demilitarized
and
must
recognise
israel
as
the
state
of
the
jewish
people
conditions
that
palestinians
say
show
he
is
not
sincere
about
peacemaking
the
united
states
arab
allies
are
strong
proponents
of
a
solution
trump
said
at
a
news
conference
in
new
york
later
on
wednesday
he
would
be
open
to
a
solution
if
that
was
the
preference
of
the
parties
themselves
a
position
he
had
previously
stated
if
the
israelis
and
the
palestinians
want
one
state
that
s
ok
with
me
if
they
want
two
states
that
s
ok
with
me
he
said
i
m
happy
if
they
re
doubts
have
mounted
over
whether
trump
s
administration
can
secure
what
he
has
called
the
ultimate
deal
since
december
when
the
president
recognised
jerusalem
as
israel
s
capital
and
then
moved
the
embassy
there
trump
said
it
is
a
dream
of
mine
to
secure
an
agreement
before
the
end
of
his
term
in
office
in
early
i
don
t
want
to
do
it
in
my
second
term
we
ll
do
other
things
in
my
second
term
he
said
i
think
a
lot
of
progress
has
been
netanyahu
said
after
meeting
trump
he
was
not
surprised
at
the
president
s
preference
for
a
solution
for
peace
with
the
palestinians
israeli
media
reports
said
jerusalem
is
one
of
the
major
issues
in
the
conflict
both
sides
claim
it
as
their
capital
trump
s
move
outraged
the
palestinians
who
have
since
boycotted
washington
s
peace
efforts
led
by
trump
s
and
adviser
jared
kushner
the
palestinians
want
to
establish
a
state
in
the
west
bank
and
the
gaza
strip
and
east
jerusalem
israel
captured
those
territories
in
the
middle
east
war
and
annexed
east
jerusalem
in
a
move
not
recognised
internationally
it
regards
all
of
the
city
as
its
eternal
and
indivisible
capital
palestinian
foreign
minister
riyad
said
trump
s
broad
commitment
to
a
solution
was
not
enough
he
has
to
spell
it
clearly
the
two
states
based
on
borders
that
east
jerusalem
is
an
occupied
territory
these
issues
are
very
important
for
us
in
order
us
to
really
move
forward
maliki
said
in
new
york
after
meeting
representatives
of
dozens
of
countries
on
the
sidelines
of
the
annual
gathering
of
world
leaders
officials
did
not
attend
that
meeting
asked
if
he
would
engage
with
the
united
states
when
it
released
its
peace
plan
maliki
said
not
at
as
long
as
he
is
sticking
to
his
decisions
about
jerusalem
about
settlements
and
about
moving
the
embassy
there
is
no
way
he
said
trump
asked
what
israel
might
have
to
give
up
in
return
for
the
embassy
s
move
to
jerusalem
replied
i
took
probably
the
biggest
chip
off
the
table
and
so
obviously
we
have
to
make
a
fair
deal
we
have
to
do
something
deals
have
to
be
good
for
both
parties
israel
got

first
chip
