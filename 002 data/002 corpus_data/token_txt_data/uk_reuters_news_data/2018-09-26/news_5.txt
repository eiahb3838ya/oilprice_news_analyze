nuclear
power
generators
urged
the
federal
government
against
taking
action
in
a
dispute
over
imported
uranium
arguing
tariffs
or
quotas
would
increase
costs
for
the
struggling
industry
and
possibly
cause
some
reactors
to
shut
according
to
a
statement
emailed
on
wednesday
the
department
of
commerce
launched
a
section
investigation
into
uranium
imports
in
july
following
complaints
by
two
uranium
mining
companies
inc
and
energy
fuels
inc
that
subsidized
foreign
competitors
have
caused
them
to
cut
capacity
and
lay
off
workers
the
move
is
a
sword
for
president
donald
trump
while
it
helps
domestic
uranium
producers
by
targeting
importers
it
undercuts
the
administration
s
efforts
to
give
a
boost
to
nuclear
power
operators
who
would
see
their
fuel
costs
increase
imposing
additional
regulatory
burdens
on
the
already
struggling
nuclear
energy
industry
will
put
good
paying
domestic
jobs
and
careers
at
risk
and
is
inconsistent
with
president
trump
s
and
the
department
of
energy
s
policy

the

find
a
way

prevent
additional
coal
and
nuclear
plants
from
shutting
which
the
administration
see
as
vital
for
national
energy
security

they
struggle
to
compete
with
cheaper
