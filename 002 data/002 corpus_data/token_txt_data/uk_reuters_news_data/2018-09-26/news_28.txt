an
estimated
people
have
been
killed
in
south
sudan
s
civil
war
and
when
factors
such
as
population
displacement
disruption
to
health
facilities
and
lack
of
food
are
included
the
death
toll
is
at
least
an
independent
study
said
fighting
broke
out
in
december
after
a
political
disagreement
between
president
salva
kiir
and
the
former
vice
president
he
had
sacked
riek
machar
a
official
said
in
that
people
had
been
killed
and
nearly
a
quarter
of
the
population
of
million
uprooted
by
the
fighting
which
has
often
been
along
ethnic
lines
about
south
sudanese
have
died
as
a
result
of
the
civil
war
the
true
number
may
be
considerably
higher
said
the
study
by
researchers
at
london
school
of
hygiene
and
tropical
medicine
released
on
tuesday
while
it
is
plausible
that
some
insecurity
would
have
persisted
in
south
sudan
even
without
the
civil
war
we
are
confident
that
a
large
majority
of
the
violent
deaths
were
attributable
to
the
war
itself
it
said
researchers
used
to
focus
on
those
killed
in
fighting
in
estimates
of
the
violence
of
a
conflict
but
increasingly
they
also
look
at
how
war
has
impacted
overall
death
rates
by
increasing
factors
such
as
hunger
and
infant
mortality
the
study
which
covered
the
period
between
december
to
april
this
year
showed
that
most
of
the
deaths
occurred
in
jonglei
unity
and
the
equatorias
states
the
rate
of
deaths
from
the
violence
peaked

kiir
signed
a
peace
agreement
with
machar
and
other
rebel
factions
in
the
ethiopian
capital
this
month
a
previous
peace
deal
signed
in
fell
apart
a
year
later
after
clashes
broke
out
between
government
forces
and
rebels
in
a
sign
of
how
fragile
the
situation
is
