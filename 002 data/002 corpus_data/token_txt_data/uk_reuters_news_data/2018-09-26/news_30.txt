over
the
final
targets
for

explaining
the
decision
a

said
holding
out
for
more
ambitious

could
result
in
an
impasse
delaying
the
crucial
climate
legislation
that
would
be
the
worst
scenario
for
the
environment
the
spokesman
told
a
news
conference
that
is
why
we
have
decided
not
to
block
the

s
proposal
as
the
basis

eu
s
executive
branch
said
that
while
its
proposed
target
of
a
percent
reduction
would
cut
pollution
from
transport
by
percent
a
stricter
target
of
percent
would
only
take
the
fall
to
percent
eu
data
also
showed
that
higher
targets
for
zero
and
low
emission
vehicles
would
cost
more
