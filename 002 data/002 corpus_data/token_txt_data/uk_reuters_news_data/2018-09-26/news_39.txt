a
chinese
equity
bounce
set
a
modestly
positive
tone
for
world
stocks
on
wednesday
as
bets
that
beijing
would
expand
stimulus
to
support
its
economy
helped
offset
some
of
the
worries
about
global
trade
tensions
and
oil
world
stocks
hung
not
far
off
highs
but
sentiment
remains
in
check
as
benchmark
bond
yields
stand
close
to
peaks
and
investors
weigh
how
much
more
policy
tightening
is
in
store
from
the
federal
reserve
shares
closed
almost
one
percent
higher
at
highs
after
global
index
provider
msci
said
it
could
quadruple
china
s
weighting
in
global
benchmarks
that
lent
fresh
impetus
to
a
market
already
buoyed
by
expectations
of
impending
state
stimulus
to
offset
the
impact
of
tariffs
beijing
is
not
expected
to
follow
federal
reserve
in
raising
interest
rates
this
week
the
chinese
over
the
summer
increased
monetary
stimulus
for
the
system
and
may
do
more
though
their
ability
going
forward
is
going
to
be
limited
said
francois
savary
chief
investment
officer
at
wealth
manager
prime
partners
savary
said
markets
had
also
been
heartened
by
the
decision
to
impose
tariffs
on
china
at
a
lower
percent
rate
that
the
percent
originally
threatened
recent
data
point
to
strong
economic
momentum
despite
concerns
about
the
trade
wars
president
donald
trump
is
waging
you
have
economic
numbers
that
are
satisfactory
so
people
feel
for
the
time
being
at
least
the
impact
on
economic
activity
from
the
trade
war
may
not
be
very
substantial
he
added
those
factors
helped
msci
s
index
of
shares
outside
japan
rise
percent
while
a

index
opened
flat
japan
s
nikkei
touched
its
highest
since
while
futures
signalled
a
firmer
opening
on
wall
street
world
shares
stayed
near
flat
following
a
weaker
close
in
new
york
as
investors
kept
a
close
watch
on
bond
yields
in
the
united
states
and
germany
borrowing
costs
in
both
countries
have
inched
to
highs
with
the
first
interest
rate
rise
by
the
european
central
bank
now
expected
in
september
two
months
earlier
than
had
been
priced
recently
treasury
yields
rose
to
as
high
as
percent
on
tuesday
near
their
peak
of
percent
hit
on
may
fed
funds
rates
futures
implied
traders
are
fully
pricing
in
a
rate
hike
on
wednesday
plus
an
percent
chance
of
another
rise
in
december
that
expectation
was
cemented
after
data
showing
consumer
confidence
hit
an
high
the
focus
will
be
on
whether
the
fed
will
indicate
its
tightening
is
coming
to
an
end
the
fed
may
not
do
so
today
but
i
expect
markets
will
soon
start
looking
to
that
scenario
said
akira
takei
bond
fund
manager
at
asset
management
one
the
fed
s
past
policy
statements
have
shown
that
policy
makers
see
percent
about
basis
points
above
the
current
levels
as
an
appropriate
level
in
the
longer
run
that
means
the
fed
could
hit
that
level
by
the
end
of
next
year
if
as
expected
it
hikes
on
wednesday
again
in
december
and
then
twice
more
in
takei
noted
signs
that
higher
rates
are
already
starting
to
hurt
the
economy
for
instance
through
rising
consumer
loan
delinquencies
he
added
the
dollar
s
softness
could
be
an
early
sign
of
growing
focus
over
an
end
to
the
tightening
cycle
the
dollar
was
flat
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
around
just
off
lows
hit
last
week
the
euro
traded
at
not

while
the

in
many
emerging

currencies
such
as
the
turkish
lira
and
the
south
african
rand
also
kept
some
distance
from
lows
hit
last
month
and
an
index
of
emerging
market
currencies
was
flat
having
risen
more
than
percent
in
the
past
week
emerging
stocks
rose
percent
oil
prices
were
supported
on
concerns
of
tight
supply
on
sanctions

they
eased

complained
