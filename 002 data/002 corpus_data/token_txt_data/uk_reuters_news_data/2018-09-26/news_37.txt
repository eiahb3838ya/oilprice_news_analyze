insight-in mexico's shale patch, cartel violence scares off drillers
reynosa
mexico
reuters
the
oil
and
gas
fracking
boom
has
lured
scores
of
drillers
to
the
eagle
ford
region
of
south
texas
the
second
largest
oil
patch
as
new
production
technology
opened
access
to
billions
more
barrels
the
play
extends
across
the
mexican
border
where
its
name
changes
to
the
burgos
basin
an
equally
fertile
shale
region
where
the
oil
and
gas
sit
mostly
idle
underground
in
a
region
terrorized
by
criminal
gangs
the
violence
here
threatens
to
derail
the
country
s
auction
of
exploration
and
production
rights
to
its
shale
fields
in
february
one
that
could
prove
pivotal
to
its
hopes
for
reversing
a
national
decline
in
crude
and
natural
gas
output
to
lows
despite
an
push
that
has
aimed
to
lure
investments
from
foreign
oil
firms
since
only
mexico
s
oil
firm
pemex
has
tried
fracking
the
country
s
shale
reserves
and
only
experimentally
even
as
fields
that
are
accessible
with
traditional
drilling
methods
are
drying
up
the
nine
shale
oil
and
gas
blocks
up
for
auction
are
all
within
burgos
in
the
northern
state
of
tamaulipas
where
the
gulf
and
zeta
cartels
have
waged
a
war
for
control
of
drug
and
routes
since
as
security
unravelled
at
least
two
pemex
workers
were
killed
and
were
kidnapped
as
gangs
demanded
protection
money
from
oil
firms
and
blocked
work
crews
from
accessing
wells
and
pipelines
a
manager
with
weatherford
international
ltd
the
oilfield
services
firm
was
also
murdered
in
april
a
pemex
security
worker
guarding
installations
against
fuel
thieves
was
killed
and
another
was
shot
in
an
ambush
in
the
tamaulipas
city
of
matamoros
after
gunmen
fired
some
rounds
into
a
vehicle
the
burgos
basin
contains
about
two
thirds
of
the
country
s
technically
recoverable
shale
reserves
estimated
at
trillion
cubic
feet
tcf
of
gas
and
billion
barrels
of
oil
and
condensate
compared
to
the
tcf
of
gas
and
billion
barrels
of
oil
and
condensate
in
the
united
states
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
companies
that
are
already
fracking
across
the
border
in
texas
would
likely
expand
into
mexico
if
the
government
could
address
the
violence
oil
executives
said
mexican
government
officials
often
field
questions
about
security
in
gatherings
where
they
promoted
the
nation
s
drilling
opportunities
to
oil
firms
in
every
meeting
i
was
able
to
attend
there
were
questions
about
security
said
jorge
rios
vice
president
of
operations
for
latin
america
with
precision
drilling
a
canadian
company
that
operates
in
the
eagle
ford
and
has
drilled
in
mexico
in
the
past
the
response
was
not
mexico
s
energy
and
interior
ministries
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
pemex
declined
to
comment
repsol
a
spanish
oil
major
left
the
burgos
basin
in
as
the
violence
escalated
ending
operations
it
began
in
as
the
first
foreign
firm
to
drill
in
mexico
since
it
nationalized
the
industry
in
the
company
which
has
shale
operations
in
eagle
ford
would
require
very
big
changes
before
it
considered
returning
to
the
burgos
a
repsol
executive
told
reuters
on
condition
of
anonymity
in
the
situation
was
difficult
to
manage
the
executive
said
now
it
s
repsol
declined
to
comment
through
its
mexican
public
relations
agency
on
the
executive
s
version
of
events
mexico
s
natural
gas
output
fell
for
third
year
in
a
row
to
million
cubic
feet
per
day
last
year
increasing
the
need
of
imported
gas
almost
entirely
from
the
united
states
to
percent
of
the
nation
s
consumption
the
growing
dependence
on
foreign
gas
prompted
the
government
to
hold
a
conference
for
energy
companies
in
the
city
of
reynosa
in
tamaulipas
to
promote
the
upcoming
shale
auction
the
parque
cultural
reynosa
conference
centre
was
guarded
by
soldiers
and
police
armed
with
automatic
weapons
but
inside
the
conference
in
february
panelists
carefully
avoided
any
mention
of
murders
or
kidnappings
one
panelist
told
reuters
he
had
specifically
been
asked
by
tamaulipas
state
officials
to
avoid
mentioning
violence
the
government
was
in
promotional
mode
they
weren
t
going
to
talk
about
the
bad
things
said
another
conference
participant
tamaulipas
state
energy
commission
and
local
officials
which
helped
organise
the
conference
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
security
problems
were
nonetheless
for
attendees
who
were
greeted
by
the
news
of
crackling
shootouts
in
the
border
city
delegates
stayed
at
a
heavily
fortified
hotel
and
waited
for
rides
to
the
conference
in
armoured
vehicles
guarded
by
soldiers
in
the
days
leading
up
to
the
conference
about
a
dozen
bodies
were
left
in
the
streets
as
cartel
linked
to
the
gulf
and
zeta
cartels
mounted
roadblocks
and
battled
security
forces
two
weeks
before
in
the
nearby
city
of
nuevo
laredo
a
gun
battle
broke
out
within
meters
of
where
the
mayor
was
giving
a
speech
another
conference
participant
a
businessman
said
the
mexican
government
had
taken
a
approach
to
the
violence
one
he
compared
unfavourably
to
colombia
where
senior
security
officials
showed
up
at
energy
conferences
a
few
years
ago
to
reassure
investors
of
progress
in
fighting
armed
rebels
if
mexico
had
a
solution
he
said
they
would
have
talked
about
in
repsol
was
awarded
a
service
contract
by
pemex
in
the
burgos
basin
to
develop
several
conventional
natural
gas
fields
along
the
area
for
years
repsol
increased
production
at
the
region
after
an
initial
investment
of
million
but
returned
the
installation
to
the
firm
in
early
when
repsol
started
the
reynosa
region
was
relatively
calm
but
within
a
couple
of
years
it
plunged
into
chaos
after
president
felipe
calderon
went
on
the
offensive
against
drug
cartels
the
repsol
executive
said
oil
firms
had
to
guard
against
kidnappings
extortion
and
having
workers
caught
in
crossfires
between
rival
gangs
along
with
is
now
mexico
s
organised
crime
fuel
theft
the
firm
invested
in
private
security
the
executive
said
but
it
wasn
t
enough
that
s
what
made
us
leave
the
executive
said
a
senior
pemex
executive
compared
the
current
situation
in
tamaulipas
to
iraq
and
colombia
during
their
years
of
conflict
saying
oil
companies
could
operate
with
appropriate
safety
measures
you
can
work
perhaps
not
as
efficiently
as
we
would
like
but
you
don
t
lose
money
either
the
executive
said
other
companies
including
newpek
a
unit
of
mexico
s
alfa
and
a
consortium
of
mexico
s
jaguar
exploración
y
producción
with
a
unit
of
canada
s
sun
god
resources
came
to
drill
in
tamaulipas
state
after
the
government
oil
reforms
by
the
time
they
arrived
strict
protocols
had
been
introduced
by
operators
and
service
firms
in
the
area
keeping
employees
inside
between
and
and
coordinating
with
the
military
before
moving
into
the
field
to
avoid
dangerous
misunderstandings
cars
are
clearly
marked
with
company
logos
and
employees
avoid
wearing
clothes
that
the
criminals
could
mistake
for
security
forces
two
oil
workers
told
reuters
they
practice
defensive
driving
move
in
convoys
and
are
told
to
respond
honestly
if
interrogated
by
the
cartel
women
are
generally
not
permitted
to
work
beyond
the
major
urban
areas
i
was
not
allowed
to
go
into
the
field
because
there
is
a
high
risk
i
could
be
raped
one
female
worker
said
liberty
oilfield
services
whose
operations
include
the
eagle
ford
has
not
considered
operating
in
mexico
in
part
because
of
safety
concerns
the
safety
of
our
workers
in
mexico
would
be
a
massive
concern
said
liberty
chief
executive
officer
chris
wright
we
d
take
some
of
our
own
actions
for
security
and
guards
but
maybe
that
