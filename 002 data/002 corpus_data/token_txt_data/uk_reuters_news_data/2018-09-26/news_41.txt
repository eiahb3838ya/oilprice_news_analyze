update 1-nissan blames latest improper tests on 'low awareness' of rules
tokyo
reuters
nissan
motor
co
said
on
wednesday
an
extremely
low
awareness
of
the
seriousness
of
inspection
standards
and
rules
had
led
to
improper
measuring
of
exhaust
emissions
and
fuel
economy
in
vehicle
models
made
in
japan
nissan
said
in
july
that
sample
testing
for
emissions
and
fuel
economy
in
final
vehicle
inspections
at
most
of
its
factories
in
japan
did
not
meet
domestic
standards
the
second
case
in
less
than
a
year
where
misconduct
was
found
in
its
inspection
process
the
nissan
case
is
the
latest
incident
of
data
tampering
which
has
tarnished
japan
s
manufacturing
industry
and
its
reputation
for
efficient
production
nissan
japan
s
second
largest
automaker
said
the
breach
of
inspection
standards
was
similar
to
a
case
last
year
when
the
firm
admitted
that
for
decades
uncertified
inspectors
had
signed
off
on
final
checks
for
cars
sold
in
japan
as
a
company
executives
managers
to
plant
supervisors
nissan
had
extremely
low
awareness
of
the
gravity
of
violating
final
vehicle
inspection
standards
and
rules
nissan
said
in
a
statement
it
blamed
the
misconduct
on
a
shortage
of
final
inspectors
and
a
lack
of
oversight
by
plant
managers
the
automaker
said
adding
it
also
needed
to
do
more
training
nissan
said
there
were
improper
inspections
during
sample
testing
of
vehicles
more
than
the
units
the
company
had
initially
reported
in
july
other
tests
for
horn
volume
external
vehicle
noise
and
the
aim
of
headlights
were
also
conducted
improperly
nissan
said
the
testing
was
for
vehicles
destined
for
the
japanese
market
and
did
not
affect
units
exported
overseas
the
automaker
has
said
nissan
said
its
sample
tests
would
now
be
overseen
by
supervisors
and
managers
it
also
planned
to
boost
the
number
of
inspectors
and
revamp
the
computer
software
used
to
measure
vehicle
emissions
separately
suzuki
motor
corp
said
on
wednesday
it
found
that
vehicles
had
been
improperly
tested
for
emissions
and
fuel
economy
slightly
higher
than
what
the
company
reported
to
the
government
in
august
last
month
suzuki
motor
mazda
motor
corp
and
yamaha
motor
co
apologised
for
improper
testing
but
said
they
did
not
find
significant
problems
with
the
actual
emissions
and
fuel
economy
of
their
vehicles
to
be
sold
in
japan
and
did
not
plan
any
recalls
