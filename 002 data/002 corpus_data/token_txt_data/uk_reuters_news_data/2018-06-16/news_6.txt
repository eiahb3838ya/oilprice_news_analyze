the
united
states
split
from
other
group
of
member
countries
on
friday
over
the
future
of
the
coal
industry
and
the
paris
climate
accord
though
all
of
them
agreed
to
transition
to
cleaner
fuels
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
speaking
at
a
press
conference
at
the
close
of
the
meeting
of
energy
ministers
in
bariloche
argentina
germany
s
director
of
energy
policy
thorsten
herdan
said
member
countries
have
to
get
out
of
coal
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
fight
climate
change
while
herdan
said
phasing
out
coal
was
discussed
at
the
meeting
there
was
no
reference
to
winding
down
coal
production
in
a
joint
statement
issued
by
the
ministers
which
encouraged
increased
investment
and
financing
in
renewable
energy
but
acknowledged
that
fossil
fuels
still
play
a
major
the
talks
come
as
the
united
states
is
evaluating
a
plan
to
prevent
struggling
coal
and
nuclear
power
plants
from
shuttering
environmentalists
and
oil
gas
solar
and
wind
energy
industry
groups
have
criticized
the
move
which
the
trump
administration
says
is
crucial
for
natural
security
it
s
not
possible
to
put
in
the
communique
that
at
a
certain
point
of
time
every
country
has
to
step
out
of
coal
due
to
the
different
requirements
every
country
has
herdan
said
we
are
not
a
club
which
what
the
others
have
to
the
meeting
marked
the
latest
disagreement
between
the
united
states
and
other
major
countries
on
climate
policy
since
president
donald
trump
last
year
pulled
the
country
out
of
the
paris
deal
reversing
a
key
commitment
by
former
president
barack
obama
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
the
united
states
the
ministers
alluded
to
that
decision
in
the
statement
noting
that
energy
transitions
were
important
to
reduce
emissions
and
for
those
countries
that
are
determined
to
implement
the
paris
that
was
one
of
the
sentences
we
a
long
time
for
herdan
said
noting
that
despite
the
withdrawal
by
the
united
states
from
the
paris
climate
agreement
other
countries
wanted
to
express
their
commitment
perhaps
we
have
to
admit
that
the
language
may
be
not
as
clear
as
everybody
would
like
to
have
it
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
that
was
the
compromise
for
us
to
go
speaking
to
reporters
earlier
on
friday
in
bariloche
energy
secretary
rick
perry
said
clean
coal
and
nuclear
energy
were
very
positive
for
the
environment
while
noting
that
carbon
capture
technology
would
help
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
