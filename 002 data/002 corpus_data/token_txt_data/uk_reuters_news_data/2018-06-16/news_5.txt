china
responded
forcefully
in
state
media
on
saturday
after
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
said
it
would
impose
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
imports
but
some
commentary
left
room
for
further
negotiations
late
on
friday
china
said
it
would
impose
additional
percent
tariffs
on
goods
worth
billion
in
response
to
the
imposition
of
tariffs
the
wise
man
builds
bridges
the
fool
builds
walls
the
official
xinhua
news
agency
said
in
an
editorial
echoing
official
comments
that
china
would
defend
its
interests
in
a
trade
war
following
the
path
of
expanding
and
opening
up
is
china
s
best
response
to
the
trade
dispute
between
china
and
the
united
states
and
is
also
the
responsibility
that
major
countries
should
have
to
the
world
it
added
an
editorial
in
the
ruling
communist
party
s
official
people
s
daily
condemned
what
it
called
the
trump
administration
s
obsession
with
playing
the
disgraceful
role
of
global
economic
disruptor
it
added
there
is
no
winner
in
a
trade
war
and
the
instigation
of
a
trade
war
is
extremely
destructive
to
global
trade
economic
globalisation
multilateral
trade
systems
and
global
production
supply
chains
the
whole
world
will
be
picking
up
the
bill
for
the
mistaken
acts
of
the
global
times
a
tabloid
run
by
the
people
s
daily
called
the
move
an
irresponsible
act
on
behalf
of
the
white
house
to
disrupt
international
trade
just
to
appeal
to
american
voters
who
are
convinced
their
president
is
fighting
for
in
an
editorial
the
official
china
daily
said
the
measure
was
a
stark
violation
of
the
core
spirit
of
recent
trade
talks
between
china
and
the
united
states
and
is
set
to
backfire
if
washington
doesn
t
back
off
from
its
dangerous
while
calling
trump
s
administration
inconsistent
and
precarious
it
expressed
hope
a
trade
war
might
yet
be
averted
given
the
frequent
of
the
donald
trump
administration
it
is
still
too
early
to
conclude
that
a
trade
war
will
start
the
editorial
said
adding
that
china
s
stance
had
been
consistent
china
welcomes
dialogue
and
is
not
afraid
of
trade
war
the
reaction
to
the
tariffs
was
muted
on
chinese
social
media
where
it
failed
to
break
into
the
top
trending
topics
on
the
weibo
platform
