each
of
the
parties
to
yemen
s
messy
civil
war
has
its
own
agenda
making
the
conflict
harder
to
resolve
this
factbox
looks
at
some
of
these
groups
and
what
they
want
in
the
late
the
houthi
family
in
far
north
yemen
set
up
a
religious
revival
movement
for
the
zaydi
sect
of
shi
ite
islam
which
had
once
ruled
yemen
but
whose
northern
heartland
had
been
marginalised
as
friction
with
the
government
grew
they
fought
a
series
of
guerrilla
wars
with
the
national
army
and
a
brief
border
conflict
with
saudi
arabia
they
built
ties
with
iran
but
it
is
not
clear
how
deep
that
relationship
goes
since
seizing
the
capital
sanaa
in
the
houthis
have
relied
on
parts
of
the
existing
bureaucracy
to
govern
and
their
strategy
is
unclear
ali
abdullah
saleh
took
power
in
north
yemen
in
and
after
unification
with
the
south
in
he
stayed
on
as
president
he
joined
with
tribal
power
brokers
to
dominate
the
country
placing
his
clansmen
in
key
positions
in
the
army
and
economy
prompting
accusations
of
massive
corruption
when
former
allies
deserted
him
during
the
arab
spring
forcing
him
from
power
saleh
disrupted
the
political
transition
and
joined
with
his
erstwhile
foes
the
houthis
helping
them
seize
sanaa
despite
their
differences
they
ruled
much
of
yemen
together
until
last
year
then
saleh
saw
a
chance
to
regain
power
for
his
family
by
turning
on
the
houthis
but
was
killed
trying
to
flee
when
saleh
switched
sides
so
did
some
commanders
and
troops
loyal
to
him
they
are
now
fighting
against
their
former
houthi
allies
under
the
late
president
s
son
ahmed
an
army
general
with
ties
to
the
uae
a
general
in
south
yemen
before
unification
hadi
sided
with
saleh
during
the
brief
civil
war
after
defeating
the
separatists
saleh
made
hadi
vice
president
when
saleh
was
forced
from
power
hadi
was
elected
to
a
term
in
to
oversee
a
transition
to
democracy
with
a
new
constitution
and
new
elections
scheduled
for
but
his
government
was
constantly
undermined
by
saleh
faced
a
renewed
southern
separatist
movement
houthi
rebellion
and
many
bombing
attacks
by
al
qaeda
the
houthis
rejected
the
new
constitution
and
elections
were
shelved
after
the
houthis
took
sanaa
hadi
fled
and
then
went
into
exile
in
saudi
arabia
he
lacks
any
power
base
of
his
own
and
is
widely
seen
as
weak
but
the
arab
coalition
s
military
intervention
is
based
on
upholding
the
legitimacy
of
his
internationally
recognised
government
and
the
political
transition
vested
in
it
after
independence
from
britain
south
yemen
became
the
only
communist
country
in
the
middle
east
but
it
suffered
constant
infighting
weakened
by
that
and
the
collapse
of
the
soviet
union
it
unified
with
saleh
s
north
yemen
in
as
it
became
clear
most
power
was
in
northern
hands
the
old
southern
leadership
tried
to
secede
in
but
was
swiftly
beaten
by
saleh
s
army
which
sacked
aden
many
southerners
have
complained
of
increasing
economic
and
political
marginalisation
the
southern
separatist
movement
has
remained
internally
divided
but
it
is
a
powerful
force
across
the
old
south
yemen
and
has
provided
many
of
the
fighters
against
the
houthis
set
up
by
members
of
the
global
jihadist
group
who
had
escaped
prison
in
yemen
and
their
comrades
who
fled
saudi
arabia
last
decade
al
qaeda
in
the
arabian
peninsula
became
one
of
its
most
powerful
branches
it
took
advantage
of
arab
spring
chaos
to
create
mini
states
in
remote
eastern
regions
and
launched
numerous
bloody
attacks
that
undermined
hadi
s
transitional
government
during
the
civil
war
it
has
carried
out
attacks
against
both
sides
any
prolonged
chaos
in
yemen
will
give
it
more
room
to
consolidate
and
plot
attacks
abroad
saudi
arabia
regards
the
houthis
as
a
proxy
for
iran
its
greatest
regional
rival
and
it
wants
to
stop
tehran
gaining
sway
in
its
neighbour
its
other
war
aims
are
to
end
houthi
missile
strikes
and
shelling
to
the
transition
process
it
backed
in
and
to
prevent
chaos
in
yemen
that
would
let
aqap
plot
attacks
on
the
kingdom
saudi
arabia
s
air
force
has
been
particularly
involved
in
yemen
but
the
kingdom
has
also
provided
a
for
hadi
and
assisted
the
ground
fighting
in
northern
yemen
the
uae
which
also
backed
the
transition
plan
is
the
other
main
participant
in
the
coalition
it
wants
to
prevent
islamist
militancy
growing
in
yemen
and
regards
the
country
s
ports
as
strategically
important
it
has
focused
on
the
war
in
southern
yemen
and
the
red
sea
coast
the
other
countries
in
the
coalition
have
been
less
closely
involved
though
sudan
has
put
some
troops
on
the
ground
iran
champions
the
houthis
as
part
of
its
regional
axis
of
resistance
and
the
movement
has
adopted
elements
of
tehran
s
revolutionary
ideology
but
while
saudi
arabia
and
its
allies
accuse
iran
of
arming
and
training
the
houthis
the
extent
of
the
relationship
is
disputed
and
tehran
has
denied
funnelling
weapons
into
yemen
