their
families
and
the
larger

an

vulnerable
areas
received
percent
of
the

less
than
the
majority
required
to
pass
the
washington
state
measure
which
garnered
percent
of
the
vote
would
have
imposed
a
fee
on
carbon
emissions
mostly
at
the
expense
of
the
state
s
oil
refiners
groups
defending
the
oil
industry
spent
a
combined
million
to
defeat
the
two

with
much
of
the

supported
by
microsoft
bill
gates
and
an
alliance
of
environmental
groups
in
arizona
voters
defeated
a
proposal
backed
by
billionaire

thomas
steyer
that
would
have
required
electricity
providers

use
renewable

for
half
of

co
the
state
s

on
wednesday
with
anadarko

noble

inc
up
percent
we
think
the
wide
margin
of
victory
matters
and
that
it
will
serve
as
a
deterrent
to
those
who
might
otherwise
decide
to
fund
another
round
of
opposition
to
the
industry
in
the
next

we
