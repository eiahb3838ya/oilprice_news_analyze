column-russia and saudi arabia's oil-market management challenge: kemp
london
reuters
russia
and
saudi
arabia
have
started
to
discuss
cutting
production
next
year
following
steep
falls
in
oil
prices
in
the
last
month
according
to
a
report
by
russia
s
tass
news
agency
the
report
has
not
been
confirmed
but
has
arrested
the
rapid
decline
in
prices
at
least
temporarily
and
should
not
come
as
a
surprise
given
the
altered
dynamics
in
the
oil
market
the
oil
market
is
best
thought
of
as
a
complex
adaptive
system
characterised
by
long
lags
and
positive
feedback
mechanisms
which
exaggerate
the
impact
of
even
small
changes
in
production
and
consumption
opec
led
by
saudi
arabia
and
its
allies
led
by
russia
have
stated
that
their
objective
is
to
keep
the
market
as
close
as
possible
to
balance
and
minimise
damaging
price
swings
but
in
the
history
of
the
oil
market
production
and
consumption
have
rarely
been
balanced
except
accidentally
and
not
usually
for
very
long
the
market
s
natural
state
is
one
of
imbalance
with
deep
and
prolonged
cycles
in
spot
prices
and
inventories
as
it
alternatives
between
periods
of
and
in
this
context
the
best
market
management
strategy
for
involves
timely
frequent
and
small
adjustments
in
production
in
response
to
changing
estimates
of
production
and
consumption
prompt
action
in
response
to
incoming
information
about
potential
future
market
imbalances
may
be
able
to
forestall
the
need
for
much
larger
adjustments
later
has
been
considerably
simplified
because
russia
and
saudi
arabia
are
the
only
two
members
of
that
need
to
reach
agreement
with
united
arab
emirates
and
kuwait
playing
a
supporting
role
other
members
of
have
no
spare
production
capacity
and
are
not
needed
to
show
much
production
flexibility
to
keep
the
market
close
to
balance
russia
and
saudi
arabia
have
already
made
several
adjustments
to
their
production
plans
this
year
in
response
to
a
changing
production
and
consumption
outlook
members
started
the
year
insisting
they
would
not
increase
production
because
of
a
lingering
overhang
of
stocks
above
the
average
by
june
russia
and
saudi
arabia
had
begun
raising
output
as
rapid
consumption
growth
and
the
loss
of
production
from
venezuela
drew
down
stocks
faster
than
expected
and
pushed
prices
higher
in
august
and
september
russia
and
saudi
arabia
came
under
renewed
pressure
to
raise
output
further
as
oil
traders
became
concerned
about
the
loss
of
exports
from
iran
due
to
sanctions
and
prices
surged
since
then
signs
of
a
renewed
surge
in
shale
production
concerns
about
consumption
growth
and
sanctions
waivers
for
iran
s
exports
have
sent
prices
sharply
lower
and
prompted
yet
another
rethink
the
biggest
sources
of
uncertainty
for
russia
and
saudi
arabia
stem
from
a
the
state
of
the
global
economy
and
oil
consumption
and
b
the
output
from
shale
fields
in
recent
weeks
economists
and
investors
have
become
increasingly
pessimistic
about
the
outlook
for
global
growth
and
by
extension
oil
consumption
in
resulting
in
sharp
falls
in
equity
and
oil
prices
while
oil
consumption
threatens
to
disappoint
on
the
downside
production
from
shale
fields
is
surprising
on
the
upside
reinforcing
the
challenge
for
shale
production
has
risen
much
faster
this
year
than
expected
with
output
in
august
up

into
if
russia
and
saudi

want
to
avoid

they
