plans

by
output
could
reach
million

grow
novak

suek
was
ready
to
float
its
shares
before
it
put
its
plans
on
hold
due
to
market
conditions
in
since
then
the
stream
of
international
russian
ipos
has
largely
dried
up
due
to
western
sanctions
but
suek
is
still
keen
to
become
a
listed
company
both
public
debt
and
public
equity
markets
would
be
interesting
for
us
landia
said
there
is
no
specific
plan
in
place
landia
said
except
to
be
prepared
to
make
such
a
move
when
the
time
is
right
media
reports
in
said
the
company
planned
to
list
its
shares
in
london
and
that
a
flotation
at
that
time
could
have
valued
the
company
at
close
to
billion
in
august
suek
merged
with
melnichenko
s
firm
sgk
to
increase
operational
and
financial
effectiveness
that
s
our
plan
be
prepared
because
the
market
is
quite
volatile
if
there
will
be
an
attractive
opportunity
we
will
be
seriously
looking
at
