two
crude
producers
are
looking
to
double
down
on
their
oil
sands
investments
betting
that
new
pipelines
and
technology
can
improve
profitability
and
reduce
environmental
damage
the
moves
by
imperial
oil
ltd
and
teck
resources
ltd
run
counter
to
an
exodus
of
foreign
companies
from
the
oil
sands
last
year
imperial
majority
owned
by
exxon
mobil
corp
said
late
on
tuesday
it
would
build
its
c
aspen
project
construction
starts
before
with
first
oil
expected
in
teck
has
not
yet
made
a
final
investment
decision
on
its
c
frontier
project
which
is
undergoing
regulatory
hearings
both
are
advancing
as
pipeline
congestion
resulted
in
record
discounts
on
canadian
oil
last
month
imperial
and
teck
bet
it
will
abate
in
the
next
few
years
enbridge
inc
is
expanding
its
line
pipeline
to
handle
more
canadian
crude
and
producers
hope
the
trans
mountain
and
transcanada
corp
keystone
xl
pipeline
expansions
go
forward
despite
opposition
a
stream
of
foreign
companies
such
as
conocophillips
divested
oil
sand
assets
last
year
steep
price
discounts
prompted
canadian
natural
resources
and
several
others
to
announce
up
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
total
production
cuts
last
week
but
imperial
said
aspen
will
use
solvents
and
steam
to
unlock
bpd
applying
new
technology
to
reduce
emissions
and
water
use
while
making
extraction
more
economical
we
try
not
to
get
too
excited
when
times
are
good
and
try
not
to
get
too
depressed
when
times
are
bad
chief
executive
officer
rich
kruger
said
at
imperial
s
investor
day
in
toronto
on
wednesday
when
s
the
best
time
to
build
things
when
no
one
else
is
building
because
you
get
the
highest
quality
trades
and
both
projects
face
doubts
that
they
will
pay
off
the
challenge
with
both
is
oil
sands
projects
are
typified
by
high
capital
said
ihs
markit
kevin
birn
and
you
have
to
wait
years
before
you
generate
any
teck
began
regulatory
hearings
in
september
for
frontier
an
mine
that
would
produce
bpd
in
its
first
phase
starting
in
the
company
said
on
monday
frontier
would
be
economical
at
a
range
of
oil
prices
and
rank
among
the
oil
sands
operations
due
to
new
technology
while
we
know
that
use
of
alternative
energy
will
increase
we
also
know
that
oil
will
remain
an
important
part
of
the
world
energy
mix
teck
spokesman
chris
stannell
said
the
outlook
for
the
global
oil
market
is
favourable
for
a
project
such
as
unlike
proposed
pipelines
aspen
and
frontier
have
the
support
of
aboriginal
peoples
living
nearby
mikisew
cree
first
nation
conditionally
supports
frontier
and
hopes
to
buy
a
stake
said
melody
lepine
the
band
s
director
that
support
should
reassure
shareholders
lepine
said
teck
and
imperial
can
go
back
to
their
investors
and
say
look
we
have
these
agreements
with
indigenous
mikisew
and
another
band
invested
last
year
in
a
suncor
energy
storage
facility
some
teck
investors
remain
skeptical
that
the
coal
miner
should
be
in
the
oil
business
said
clarksons
analyst
jeremy
sussman
teck
owns
part
of
a
suncor
oil
sands
mine
do
you
double
down
do
you
divest
it
s
an
open
question
he
said
the
odds
appear
longer
for
teck
s
frontier
to
succeed
than
imperial
s
aspen
said
manash
goswami
senior
at
first
asset
etfs
which
owns
imperial
shares
the
teck
frontier
project
doesn
t
make
any
sense
goswami
maintained
it
s
hard
to
see
unless
oil
prices
go
materially
higher
another
mining
project
getting
but
a
industry
opponent
now
sees
a
future
for
crude
chief
allan
adam
of
athabasca
chipewyan
first
nation
recently
backed
frontier
he
reasoned
that
oil
is
not
going
away
and
he
can
better
protect
community
interests
from
the
inside
if
people
are
saying
the
oil
sands
are
going
to
die
off
i
imagine
they
re
going
to
park
their
vehicles
and
start
walking
i
don
t
think
that
s
going
to
happen
anytime
