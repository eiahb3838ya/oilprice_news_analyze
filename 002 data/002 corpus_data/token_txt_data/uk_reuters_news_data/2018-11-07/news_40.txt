world
stocks
rose
on
wednesday
with
wall
street
surging
after
the
midterm
election
a
day
earlier
divided
control
of
congress
but
the
outcome
which
casts
doubt
on
further
tax
cuts
hit
the
dollar
and
sent
treasury
yields
lower
the
democrats
looked
headed
for
a
gain
of
more
than
seats
in
the
house
of
representatives
well
beyond
the
they
needed
to
claim
their
first
majority
in
eight
years
with
president
donald
trump
s
republican
party
holding
on
to
its
senate
majority
the
results
from
tuesday
s
election
were
in
line
with
expectations
while
gridlock
in
washington
could
hamper
trump
s
political
and
economic
agenda
few
expect
a
reversal
of
tax
cuts
and
financial
deregulation
measures
that
have
already
been
enacted
that
view

the

added

to
the
good
news
in
a
way
for
markets
is
that
there
was
an
uncertainty
that
s
now
been
removed
we
know
where
we
stand
for
the
next
two
years

investors
will
focus
back
on
the

still
a
split
congress
could
hamper
trump
s
push
for
a
further
round
of
tax
cuts
and
deregulation
measures
that
have
turbocharged
the
economy
stock
markets
and
the
dollar
after
volatile
asian
trade
where
stocks
and
the

swung
on
the

fluctuating
prospects
the

basis
points
the
fed
is
expected
to
signal
this
week
that
an
interest
rate
rise
remains
on
the
agenda
for
december
certainly
it
is
now
unlikely
we
will
see
additional
fiscal
stimulus
in
the
that
s
a
profound
change
but
there
will
be
no
repeal
of
what
s
already
in
place
miller
said
that
view
pushed
the
dollar
lower
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
index
fell
percent
with
the
euro
up
percent
to
treasury
bond
yields
at
one
point
fell
to
a
low
of
percent
as
it
became
clear
that
more
fiscal
stimulus
was
unlikely
an
initial
rise
to
percent
came
after
early
reports
of
a
performance
by
the
republicans
but
that
move
soon
fizzled
as
results
trickled
in
democrats
winning
the
house
is
likely
to
mean
slightly
less
fiscal
stimulus
going
forward
the
bond
market
may
take
that
well
because
the
federal
reserve
will
have
less
work
to
do
