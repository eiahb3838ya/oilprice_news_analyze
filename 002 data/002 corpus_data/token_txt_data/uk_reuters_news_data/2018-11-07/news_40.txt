italian
refiner
saras
is
constructing
a
terminal
at
its
sardinia
plant
and
will
market
a
new
cleaner
marine
fuel
ahead
of
a
major
regulatory
change
in
its
chief
executive
told
reuters
from
january
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
will
ban
ships
from
using
fuels
with
a
sulphur
content
above
percent
compared
with
percent
now
in
one
of
the
biggest
changes
in
the
oil
market
in
decades
refineries
around
the
world
have
been
gearing
up
for
the
switch
by
reducing
output
of
fuel
and
upgrading
plants
to
maximise
production
of
the
cleaner
more
expensive
fuel
which
is
similar
to
diesel
saras
is
investing
in
infrastructure
that
will
allow
ships
to
dock
outside
its
sarroch
refinery
in
sardinia
to
directly
load
marine
fuel
oil
ulsfo
in
what
is
known
as
bunkering
ceo
dario
scaffardi
said
today
bunkering
is
based
mainly
on
blending
in
the
mediterranean
you
have
malta
where
people
bring
different
fuels
and
blend
it
with
the
new
specs
this
blending
will
be
very
difficult
to
achieve
for
technical
reasons
so
people
like
us
who
will
be
able
to
produce
directly
the
new
fuel
will
have
the
competitive
advantage
scaffardi
said
with
a
small
investment
we
will
have
bunkering
infrastructure
and
a
lightering
vessel
and
start
selling
locally
fuels
to
expand
the
the
company
did
not
disclose
the
size
of
the
investment
saras
one
of
europe
s
most
modern
refineries
which
also
has
a
trading
desk
in
geneva
is
developing
its
own
ulsfo
that
the
company
will
start
marketing
directly
to
shippers
the
plant
will
initially
produce
to
tonnes
of
ulsfo
per
year
he
said
this
is
a
new
line
of
business
and
we
should
be
able
to
adapt
to
various
