president
donald

on
wednesday
praised
interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
who
has
come
under
scrutiny
for
his
use
of
a
security
detail
chartered
flights
and
a
real
estate
deal
but
seemed
to
leave
open
the
possibility
of
replacing
him
we
re
looking
at
that
and
i
do
want
to
study
whatever
is
being
said
i
think
he
s
doing
an
excellent
job
but
we
will
take
a
look
at
that
in
a
very
strong
and
we
ll
probably
have
an
idea
about
that
in
about
a
week
trump
told
reporters
last
month
the
interior
department
s
acting
inspector
general
referred
a
probe
into
zinke
s
conduct
to
the
department
of
justice
increasing
the
chances
of
a
criminal
investigation
the
investigation
is
expected
to
involve
a
montana
real
estate
deal
involving
a
foundation
set
up
by
zinke
and
a
development
group
backed
by
david
lesar
the
chairman
of
oil
service
company
halliburton
a
lesar
spokeswoman
has
said
that
his
personal
investment
had
nothing
to
do
with
halliburton
and
that
the
company
was
confident
it
would
not
influence
the
interior
department
the
inspector
general
s
office
at
interior
has
also
probed
zinke
over
several
ethics
allegations

watchdog
agency
said
last
month
that
zinke
s
sending
of
a
security
detail
to
turkey
and
greece
to
protect
him
and
his
wife
cost
taxpayers
over
zinke
has
said
he
did
not
ask
the
security
detail
to
travel
with
him
probes
into
zinke
s
behavior
follow
ethics
investigations
into
several
trump
administration
officials

the
head
of
the
environmental
