cut
its

blaming
an

million
hit
from
higher

however
the
carrier
which
mainly
serves
passengers
in

eastern
europe
said
it
was
better
placed
to
cope
with
rising
fuel
prices
than
many
rivals
it
pointed
to
its
cost
model
and
expansion
plans
based
on
the
arrival
of
new

i

the

is
necessarily
a
structurally
bad
thing

larger
airlines
have
also
suffered
ryanair
cut
its
profit
forecast
in

while
easyjet
has
said
the
outlook
for
revenues
per
seat
for
the
six
months
to
march
is
negative
in
the
short
term
wizz
said
it
would
mitigate
higher
fuel
prices
by
reining
in
costs
and
reducing
capacity
growth
to
percent
from
a
previously
planned
percent
helping
to
boost
ticket
prices
while
the
in
the
guidance
is
disappointing

is
in

the
strong

momentum
is

and

was
a
buying
opportunity
wizz

could
double

worth
wading
into
a
adverse
