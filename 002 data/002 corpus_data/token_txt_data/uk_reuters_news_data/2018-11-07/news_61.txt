japan approves extension for reactor similar to fukushima units that melted down
tokyo
nov
reuters
japan
s
nuclear
regulator
approved
an
extension
of
operations
for
a
reactor
near
tokyo
that
has
the
same
basic
design
as
those
that
melted
down
in
the
fukushima
crisis
nearly
eight
years
ago
a
move
that
is
likely
to
be
controversial
the
reactor
tokai
daini
is
the
first
boiling
water
reactor
bwr
to
be
approved
for
a
lifetime
extension
of
years
the
approval
will
be
a
boost
for
operator
japan
atomic
power
co
which
is
owned
by
the
country
s
main
utilities
and
is
bleeding
cash
because
of
the
shutdown
of
its
two
nuclear
power
units
japan
s
nuclear
regulation
authority
approved
the
extension
at
a
meeting
of
its
commissioners
on
wednesday
it
said
japan
atomic
must
complete
safety
upgrades
and
a
company
spokesman
told
reuters
the
nuclear
operator
will
build
a
tsunami
protection
wall
to
fortify
tokai
daini
a
restart
of
the
plant
is
not
expected
till
the
japan
atomic
will
also
need
the
approval
of
local
and
prefectural
authorities
before
it
can
resume
operations
tokai
daini
was
operating
when
a
massive
earthquake
struck
off
the
northeast
coast
of
japan
on
march
creating
a
tsunami
that
swamped
tokyo
electric
power
s
fukushima
daichi
plant
to
the
north
causing
explosions
and
meltdowns
at
three
reactors
the
tokai
daini
plant
sustained
damage
but
shut
down
automatically
according
to
japan
atomic
while
the
extension
will
be
a
further
boost
for
japan
s
resurgent
nuclear
industry
the
sector
will
still
miss
a
government
target
of
providing
at
least
a
fifth
of
the
country
s
electricity
by
an
analysis
by
reuters
showed
last
week
nuclear
power
remains
an
unpopular
energy
option
in
japan
and
the
country
will
reboot
only
a
fraction
of
the
reactors
it
had
before
the
disaster
six
reactors
at
fukushima
daiichi
are
being
dismantled
in
a
exercise
that
is
fraught
with
technological
challenges
and
hampered
by
radioactive
waste
operators
have
also
decided
to
decommission
a
further
units
across
the
country
since
fukushima
nine
reactors
have
restarted
all
of
them
pressurized
water
reactors
located
far
from
tokyo
while
the
stigma
of
fukushima
still
hangs
over
use
of
the
older
bwr
technology
