wall
street
looked
set
for
a
surge
on
wednesday
and
global
stocks
rose
after
sharp
election
gains
for
the
opposition
democrats
but
the
outcome
which
casts
doubt
on
further
tax
cuts
hit
the
dollar
and
sent
treasury
yields
lower
the
democrats
looked
headed
for
a
gain
of
more
than
seats
well
beyond
the
they
needed
to
claim
their
first
majority
in
the
house
in
eight
years
with
president
donald
trump
s
republican
party
holding
onto
its
senate
majority
the
results
from
tuesday
s
elections
were
in
line
with
expectations
while
gridlock
in
washington
could
hamper
trump
s
political
and
economic
agenda
few
expect
a
reversal
of
tax
cutting
and
financial
deregulation
measures
that
have
already
been
enacted
that
view
put
all
three
new
york
equity
indices
on
track
for
a
strong
opening
with
s
and
nasdaq
futures
up
percent
and
percent
respectively
while
the
dow
jones
was
set
to
open
up
percent
by
gmt
the
good
news
in
a
way
for
markets
is
that
there
was
an
uncertainty
that
s
now
been
removed
we
know
where
we
stand
for
the
next
two
years
and
investors
will
focus
back
on
the
fundamentals
which
are
company
earnings
growth
and
the
economy

volatile

trade

stocks
and

fluctuating
prospects
a

benchmark

sylvain
goyon
head
of
equity
strategy
at
the
oddo
brokerage
in
paris
said
many
investors
had
been
on
the
sidelines
before
the
election
due
to
what
he
called
an
uncertainty
premium
now
it
s
behind
us
there
s
a
good
reason
for
them
to
get
back
to
the
market
he
said
most
analysts
agree
the
newly
empowered
house
democrats
will
have
the
ability
to
investigate
trump
s
tax
returns
possible
business
conflicts
of
interest
and
allegations
involving
his
campaign
s
links
to
russia
moreover
a
split
congress
will
be
able
to
hamper
trump
s
push
for
a
further
round
of
tax
cuts
and
deregulation
measures
that
have
the
economy
stock
markets
and
the
dollar
the
fed
is
expected
to
signal
this
week
that
an
interest
rate
rise
remains
on
the
agenda
for
december
certainly
it
is
now
unlikely
we
will
see
additional
fiscal
stimulus
in
the
that
s
a
profound
change
but
there
will
be
no
repeal
of
what
s
already
in
place
miller
said
that
view
pushed
the
dollar
percent
lower
against
a
basket
of
currencies
while
treasury
bond
yields
fell
to
a
low
of
percent
as
it
became
clear
that
more
fiscal
stimulus
was
unlikely
an
initial
rise
to
percent
came
after
early
reports
of
a
performance
by
the
republicans
but
that
move
soon
fizzled
as
results
trickled
in
bond
markets
may
remain
under
pressure
from
this
week
s
record
volumes
of
government
debt
supply
and
the
yawning
federal
deficit
many
also
reckon
more
spending
increases
are
still
possible
even
with
a
split
government
i
expect
more
fiscal
stimulus
ahead
there
is
some
possibility
for
compromise
on
infrastructure
spending
as
well
said
steve
friedman
a
senior
economist
at
bnp
paribas
asset
management
attention
will
also
focus
on
trump
s
hard
line
on
trade
tariffs
which
he
can
impose
without
congressional
approval
that
keeps
alive
worries
about
a
trade
war
between
china
and
the
united
states
chinese
shares
closed
percent
lower
while
hong
kong
markets
ended
just
above
flat
we
would
argue
that
if
trump
can
do
less
on
the
domestic
front
he
is
more
likely
to
focus
on
external
matters
such
as
trade
which
will
impact
risk
sentiment
said
patrick
o
donnell
investment
manager
at
aberdeen
asset
management
in
london
the
dollar
s
weakness
boosted
other
currencies
against
the
yen
the
greenback
eased
percent
to
reversing
earlier
gains
to
a
high
of
yen
the
euro
rose
percent
to
a
high
while
the
british
pound
gained
percent
to
rising
for
a
third
straight
day
after
a
bbc
report
that
britain
was
preparing
for
a
brexit
deal
by
oil
prices
were
soft
after
a

fall
the
