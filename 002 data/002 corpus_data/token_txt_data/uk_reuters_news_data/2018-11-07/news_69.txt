wall
street
stock
futures
and
asian
shares
dropped
on
wednesday
as
early
results
of
the
midterm
elections
started
to
trickle
in
with
investors
bracing
for
the
republicans
to
lose
their
grip
on
congress
s
futures
dropped
percent
as
democrats
are
seen
as
likely
to
pick
up
a
few
seats
on
the
east
coast
in
the
congressional
elections
which
is
billed
as
a
referendum
on
president
donald
trump
s
polarising
style

policies
the

also

normally
lower

democrats
are
favoured
by
election
forecasters
to
pick
up
the
seats
they
need
to
gain
a
majority
in
the
house
but
have
slimmer
chances
of
gaining
control
of
the
senate
opinion
polls
show
we
like
many
other
market
players
expect
democrats
to
take
the
house
and
to
have
a
split
congress
that
should
mean
trump
won
t
be
able
to
push
for
further
tax
cuts
and
could
lead

a
mood
in

said
masahiro
ichikawa
senior
strategist
at
sumitomo
mitsui
asset
management
but
that
is
probably
already
factored
in

i
would
think
any
additional
selling
in
stocks
would
be
limited

said
many
investors
also
expect
trump
to
continue
to
take
a
hard
line
on

which
he
can
impose
without
congressional
approval

trump
s
massive
tax
cut
enacted
in
december
and
a

reached
