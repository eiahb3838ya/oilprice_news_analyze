divided

but
the
vote
s
outcome
which
cast
doubt
on
further
tax
cuts
hit
the
dollar
and
sent
treasury
yields
lower
while
gridlock
in
washington
could
hamper
president
donald
trump
s
political
and
economic
agenda
few
expect
a
reversal
of
tax
cuts
and
financial
deregulation

their
first
majority
in
eight
years
with
trump
s
republican
party
holding

to
its
senate
majority
the
results
from
tuesday
s
election
were
in
line
with
expectations
the
good
news
in
a
way
for
markets
is
that
there
was
an
uncertainty
that
s
now
been
removed
we
know
where
we
stand
for
the
next
two
years

its

that

the

trying
to
figure
out
the
impact
of
the
election
on

spending

in
the

democrats
winning
the

is
likely
to
mean
slightly
less
fiscal
stimulus
going
forward
the
bond
market
may
take
that
well
because
