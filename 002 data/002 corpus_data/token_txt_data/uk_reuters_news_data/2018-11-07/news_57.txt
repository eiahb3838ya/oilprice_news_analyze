wall
street
stock
futures
and
asian
shares
held
earlier
gains
on
wednesday
after
democrats
won
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
boosting
the
party
s
ability
to
block
president
donald
trump
s
political
and
economic
agenda
the
democrats
house
win
creates
a
clear
hurdle
for
republicans
to
easily
pass
legislation
through
both
chambers
of
congress
clouding
the
outlook
for
some
of
trump
s
key
economic
proposals
in
asian
trade
major
broadcasters
projected
the
democrats
would
wrest
house
control
while
the
republicans
were
seen
retaining
the
senate
while
both
outcomes
were
broadly
in
line
with
market
expectations
a
reason
markets
did
not
sell
off
the
prospect
of
political
gridlock
creates
some
uncertainty
for
investors
the
dollar
weakened
against
most
of
its
major
counterparts
in
equities
markets
s
futures
rose
percent
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
rose
percent
and
japan
s
nikkei
gained
percent
it
has
clearly
become
difficult
for
republicans
to
pass
additional
tax
cuts
or
amendments
to
regulations
on
financial
institutions
for
instance
said
tomoaki
shishido
fixed
income
analyst
at
nomura
securities
investor
sentiment
had
been
volatile
in
asian
trade
with
stocks
and
the
dollar
swinging
on
the
republicans
fluctuating
prospects
of
retaining
the
house
while
a
split
congress
would
put
a
brake
on
trump
s
agenda
such
as
tax
cuts
or
deregulation
some
investors
think
the
democrats
may
agree
to
more
spending
there
are
still
areas
with
compromise
for
spending
so
even
with
a
split
government
i
expect
more
fiscal
stimulus
ahead
there
is
some
possibility
for
compromise
on
infrastructure
spending
as
well
said
steve
friedman
new
senior
economist
at
bnp
paribas
asset
management
if
there
is
additional
fiscal
stimulus
it
suggests
that
fiscal
policy
is
more
of
a
tailwind
for
growth
and
it
should
all
things
equal
be
supportive
for
on
the
other
hand
many
investors
also
expect
trump
to
continue
to
take
a
hard
line
on
tariffs
which
he
can
impose
without
congressional
approval
that
keeps
alive
worries
about
a
trade
war
between
china
and
the
united
states
trump
s
massive
tax
cut
enacted
in
december
and
a
spending
agreement
reached
in
february
have
helped
lift
the
economy
but
they
have
also
widened
federal
budget
deficit
as
a
result
treasury
