in
the
end
president
donald
trump
kicked
the
iran
crude
oil
sanctions
can
six
months
down
the
road
raising
questions
as
to
how
the
various
players
in
the
dispute
will
use
the
time
the
government
granted
waivers
to
eight
buyers
of
iranian
crude
exempting
them
from
the
sanctions
that
came
into
effect
this
week
that
are
aimed
at
reducing
exports
from
the
islamic
republic
to
zero
the
waivers
will
allow
the
eight
countries
which
include
top
buyers
china
and
india
to
keep
buying
crude
for
another
days
a
move
aimed
at
reducing
the
shock
of
a
sudden
loss
of
all
iranian
exports
there
are
a
number
of
ways
of
looking
at
the
decision
to
grant
waivers
to
countries
which
together
account
for
some
percent
of
iran
s
total
oil
exports
the
first
would
be
that
trump
and
his
administration
effectively
blinked
first
in
their
dispute
with
iran
over
its
nuclear
and
missile
programmes
it
could
also
be
argued
that
it
was
a
rare
example
of
realpolitik
from
the
trump
administration
with
the
tacit
recognition
that
cutting
iran
s
exports
to
zero
in
one
fell
swoop
would
boost
crude
prices
hurting
not
only
consumers
but
also
the
rest
of
the
world
trump
was
keen
to
talk
up
his
administration
s
capability
of
completely
isolating
iran
but
perhaps
with
an
eye
on
the
elections
on
tuesday
he
made
it
clear
that
keeping
crude
prices
low
was
also
a
priority
i
could
get
the
iran
oil
down
to
zero
immediately
but
it
would
cause
a
shock
to
the
market
i
don
t
want
to
lift
oil
prices
trump
told
reporters
on
before
flying
to
a
campaign
event
the
decision
to
grant
the
waivers
has
already
calmed
oil
markets
which
hadn
t
really
anticipated
tehran
s
exports
dropping
to
zero
but
may
have
also
been
uncertain
as
to
how
much
crude
would
actually
be
lost
brent
crude
closed
at
a
barrel
on
tuesday
down
percent
from
the
close
on
and
down
percent
from
the
high
of
reached
on
and
port
data
suggests
that
iran
has
already
suffered
a
fairly
steep
drop
in
exports
prior
to
the
of
sanctions
from
some
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
exports
in
iran
s
exports
dropped
to
around
million
bpd
in
recent
months
according
to
refinitiv
data
a
further
drop
is
on
the
cards
for
november
with
the
caveat
that
tracking
iran
s
exports
has
become
more
difficult
given
that
tankers
are
turning
off
their
systems
with
the
granting
of
the
waivers
it
s
likely
that
iran
will
be
able
to
keep
its
exports
at
least
around
million
bpd
and
possibly
even
as
high
as
the
million
bpd
of
recent
months
for
the
iranians
the
waivers
provides
them
with
a
financial
lifeline
and
time
to
try
and
lobby
support
from
other
countries
against
washington
s
sanctions
for
major
buyers
like
china
which
imported
about
bpd
of
iranian
crude
in
the
first
months
of
the
year
the
waivers
allow
it
to
maintain
diversity
of
supply
as
well
as
keeping
prices
lower
with
iranian
barrels
still
in
the
market
the
pressure
on
other
major
exporters
like
saudi
arabia
and
russia
to
ensure
a
market
or
risk
trump
s
displeasure
is
reduced
but
they
may
not
be
happy
if
crude
prices
continue
to
weaken
the
big
question
is
how
does
the
trump
administration
use
the
window
it
has
granted
to
iran
will
there
be
any
genuine
attempts
to
find
common
ground
with
tehran
on
deal
reached
together
with
other
western
powers
to
limit
iran
s
nuclear
programme
or
will
the
united
states
use
to
time
to
ensure
that
it
can
enforce
the
sanctions
when
the
days
expires
while
not
causing
oil
prices
to
spike
it
seems
unlikely
that
washington
and
tehran
could
agree
to
the
nuclear
deal
in
such
a
short
time
period
even
if
only
relatively
minor
changes
were
made
similar
to
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
recently
concluded
by
the
trump
administration
and
canada
and
mexico
in
the
meantime
the
oil
market
can
probably
cross
iran
off
its
list
of
worries
but
pencil
it
back
for
sometime
around
april
next
year
