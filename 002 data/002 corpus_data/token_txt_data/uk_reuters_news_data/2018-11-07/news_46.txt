washington state carbon tax poised to fail after big oil campaign
reuters
washington
state
was
heading
toward
rejecting
a
ballot
initiative
to
create
the
first
carbon
tax
in
the
united
states
a
tally
of
about
percent
of
votes
showed
early
on
wednesday
after
an
oil
industry
campaign
argued
it
would
hurt
the
economy
the
carbon
emissions
fee
and
revenue
allocation
initiative
known
as
initiative
would
have
imposed
a
fee
on
each
metric
ton
of
carbon
emissions
rising
a
year
until
the
state
s
emissions
target
is
met
with
more
than
two
million
votes
counted
by
early
wednesday
the
no
votes
were
leading
with
percent
the
seattle
times
and
other
local
media
outlets
reported
that
the
measure
had
failed
although
a
spokesman
for
the
yes
on
campaign
said
it
was
not
ready
to
concede
given
some
ballots
remained
to
be
counted
the
carbon
fee
aimed
to
generate
billion
over
five
years
for
clean
energy
and
air
programs
according
to
a
state
analysis
the
oil
industry
was
expected
to
feel
most
pain
because
transport
contributes
percent
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
washington
state
a
state
report
said
the
western
states
petroleum
association
raised
million
from
oil
companies
and
business
groups
to
oppose
the
measure
the
most
spent
in
the
state
to
defeat
a
ballot
initiative
according
to
state
campaign
finance
data
that
fueled
months
of
television
and
digital
ads
along
with
flyers
and
mailers
in
the
state
that
argued
the
fee
would
drive
up
energy
costs
for
consumers
small
businesses
and
farms
top
donors
to
the
no
on
campaign
included
bp
america
phillips
and
marathon
oil
corp
unit
andeavor
all
three
own
refineries
in
the
state
big
oil
raised
double
the
million
spent
on
supporting
the
initiative
by
an
alliance
of
green
groups
and
billionaire
activists
including
bill
gates
and
michael
bloomberg
the
battle
reflected
the
stakes
of
climate
regulation
the
oil
industry
worries
new
curbs
on
carbon
emissions
will
hobble
business
while
environmentalists
worry
that
a
failure
to
act
soon
to
halt
global
warming
will
have
devastating
consequences
for
the
planet
washington
is
the
nation
s
fifth
biggest
state
with
five
refineries
those
facilities
last
year
produced
about
million
metric
tons
of
carbon
dioxide
according
to
the
environmental
protection
agency
an
amount
that
would
yield
the
state
over
million
in
revenue
from
the
tax
