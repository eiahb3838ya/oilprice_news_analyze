wall
street
stock
futures
and
asian
shares
erased
most
of
their
earlier
gains
in
choppy
trade
on
wednesday
as
results
from
the
midterm
elections
showed
republicans
close
to
losing
their
grip
on
congress
s
futures
were
last
up
percent
paring
most
of
their
percent
gain
earlier
as
the
latest
results
improved
the
odds
of
opposition
democrats
taking
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
congressional
elections
is
billed
as
a
referendum
on
president
donald
trump
s
polarising
style
and
america
first
policies
investor
sentiment
has
been
volatile
in
asian
trade
with
stocks
and
the
dollar
swinging
on
the
republicans
fluctuating
prospects
of
retaining
the
house
by
late
morning
broadcasters
were
projecting
the
democrats
to
have
wrested
control
of
the
house
asian
shares
retained
most
of
their
gains
but
were
off
their
highs
with
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
up
percent
while
japan
s
nikkei
rose
percent
leading
into
the
election
investors
had
expected
the
democrats
to
gain
a
majority
in
the
house
and
as
a
result
remained
sceptical
about
trump
s
proposal
late
last
month
on
tax
cuts
for
households
market
participants
had
previously
said
a
surprise
house
win
by
the
republicans
could
boost
the
chances
of
further
tax
cuts
and
policies
while
a
democrats
victory
was
likely
to
have
already
been
priced
in
in
the
senate
race
the
republicans
held
an
upper
hand
unseating
a
democratic
incumbent
in
indiana
which
democrats
badly
needed
to
win
that
chamber
the
house
results
so
far
are
showing
a
better
than
expected
performance
for
the
republicans
even
if
they
don
t
keep
the
house
said
steven
englander
global
head
of
fx
research
at
standard
chartered
bank
in
new
york
so
it
doesn
t
look
like
a
big
blue
wave
and
republicans
might
do
a
bit
better
than
expected
in
the
senate
and
the
market
is
therefore
reacting
with
a
stronger
dollar
higher
yields
and
higher
equities
he
said
on
the
other
hand
many
investors
also
expect
trump
to
continue
to
take
a
hard
line
on
tariffs
which
he
can
impose
without
congressional
approval
that
keeps
alive
worries
about
a
trade

between
china
and
the
united

trump
s
massive
tax
cut
enacted
in
december
and
a
spending
agreement
reached
in
february
have
helped
lift
the
economy
but
they
have
also
widened

a
