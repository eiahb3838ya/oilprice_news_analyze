imperial
oil
ltd
said
on
tuesday
that
it
would
go
ahead
with
the
construction
of
its
c
billion
billion
aspen
project
in
northern
alberta
the
first
new
oil
sand
development
to
be
greenlighted
since
the
calgary
company
which
is
majority
owned
by
exxon
mobil
said
it
would
start
construction
on
the
project
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
with
first
output
expected
in
the
aspen
project
will
use
new
recovery
technology
to
lower
emissions
and
water
use
and
improve
project
economics
the
company
said
alberta
s
oil
sands
have
been
criticized
for
being
more
carbon
intensive
than
other
global
crude
operations
we
do
not
take
investment
decisions
lightly
particularly
in
these
challenging
times
said
imperial
chief
executive
rich
kruger
in
a
statement
this
is
the
right
technology
at
the
right
time
to
make
a
competitive
imperial
said
there
is
potential
to
further
expand
aspen
to
barrels
per
day
depending
on
project
performance
and
overall
business
and
market
conditions
the
discount
on
western
canadian
crudes
has
hit
record
levels
this
year
as
rising
output
from
alberta
s
oil
sands
has
run
up
against
pipelines
leading
to
higher
volumes
stuck
in
storage
while
crude
by
rail
volumes
are
rising
hitting
a
record
near
barrels
per
day
in
august
they
are
not
yet
at
levels
needed
to
clear
the
glut
the
situation
has
prompted
a
number
of
major
canadian
producers
to
say
they
will
not
go
ahead
with
any
new
projects
or
expansions
until
more
pipeline
capacity
is
in
place
but
the
situation
is
improving
enbridge
inc
said
last
week
it
expects
its
line
project
to
be
in
service
in
late
while
transcanada
corp
said
it
is
working
to
start
construction
on
its
keystone
xl
pipeline
next
year
the
last
major
oil
sand
project
to
be
approved
in
alberta
was
the
suncor
energy
fort
hills
project
in
which
is
now
ramping
up
to
full
output
