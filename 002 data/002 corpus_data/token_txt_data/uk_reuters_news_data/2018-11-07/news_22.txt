norway
s
trillion
wealth
fund
the
world
s
largest
will
not
yet
blacklist
firms
for
producing
too
much
greenhouse
gases
as
mandated
by
parliament
because
further
clarification
is
needed
the
board
of
the
norwegian
central
bank
said
on
wednesday
the
fund
is
forbidden
by
parliament
from
investing
in
firms
that
produce
nuclear
weapons
or
landmines
or
are
involved
in
the
production
of
tobacco
among
other
criteria
carbon
emissions
became
a
criteria
for
exclusion
from
the
fund
in
and
last
year
the
council
on
ethics
the
fund
s
ethics
watchdog
recommended
a
small
handful
of
firms
be
excluded
for
producing
too
much
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
either
the
oil
cement
and
steel
sectors
since
then
recommendations
have
been
under
review
by
the
board
of
the
central
bank
which
oversees
the
fund
but
a
decision
has
been
delayed
several
times
on
wednesday
the
board
said
it
had
discussed
the
recommendations
from
the
ethics
watchdog
at
a
meeting
on
the
board
did
not
decide
on
any
exclusions
of
individual
companies
at
this
meeting
governor
oeystein
olsen
and
deputy
governor
egil
matsen
said
in
a
letter
to
the
finance
ministry
dated
and
published
wednesday
among
the
reasons
it
cited
was
that
more
work
was
needed
to
assess
the
ground
for
exclusion
compared
with
other
criteria
in
the
ethics
guidelines
the
climate
criterion
does
not
provide
a
very
precise
definition
of
what
conduct
should
constitute
grounds
for
a
decision
to
exclude
said
the
letter
norges
bank
would
ask
the
ministry
of
finance
to
help
clarify
whether
the
primary
basis
for
assessment
against
the
climate
criterion
is
intended
to
be
companies
matsen
told
reuters
in
june
that
the
main
difficulty
in
discussions
had
been
to
define
and
limit
this
new
type
of
criteria
based
on
the
companies
conduct
or
behaviour
rather
than
their
products
