voters
in
colorado
arizona
and
washington
states
rejected
ballot
initiatives
that
sought
to
curb
fossil
fuels
use
by
restricting
drilling
putting
a
fee
on
carbon
emissions
and
mandating
wider
use
of
renewable
energy
the
results
were
a
setback
for
green
activists
but
a
win
for
the
energy
industry
and
the
trump
administration
which
has
sought
to
unfetter
oil
gas
and
coal
production
by
rolling
back
environmental
protections
the
outcomes
showed
voters
reject
policies
that
would
make
energy
more
expensive
said
thomas
pyle
president
of

advocacy
group
american

alliance
while
polls
had
indicated
rising
concerns
among
americans
over
carbon
emissions
and

quality
the
measures
on
the

in
the

to
rein
in
fossil

were
soundly
rejected
on

on
tuesday
in
colorado
an
initiative
to
limit
new
drilling
near
populated
or
vulnerable
areas
which
would
have
heavily
curtailed
the
industry
received
percent
of
the
vote
less
than
the
majority
required
to
pass
the
washington
state
measure
meanwhile
which
would
have
imposed
the
nation
s
first
fee
on
carbon

mostly
at
the
expense
of
the
state
s
oil
refiners
garnered
only
percent
of
the
vote
groups
defending
the
oil
industry
spent
a
combined
million
to
defeat
the
colorado
and
washington
measures
with
much
of
the
contributions
coming
from
large
energy
companies
including
bp

and
marathon
oil
corp
unit
andeavor
environmental
groups
blamed
the
defeat
of
the

voters
said
at
an
event
on
wednesday
to
discuss
the
election
washington
state
s
measure
was
supported
by
millions
of
dollars
in
contributions
from
microsoft

other
billionaires
and
environmental
groups
ted
halstead
head
of
the
climate
leadership
council
an
group
proposing
a
nationwide
carbon
tax
said
the
defeat
of
the
washington
state
carbon
fee
highlights
the
need
for
a
popular
and
politically
viable
approach
to
carbon
pricing
at
the
federal
a
tax
or
fee

intended
to
reduce

emissions
in
arizona
voters
defeated
a
proposal
backed
by
billionaire
activist
thomas
steyer
that
would
have
required
electricity
providers
to
use
renewable
energy
for
half
of
their
needs
by
up
from
the
current
percent
the
measure
was
opposed
by
arizona
public
service
co
the
state
s
largest
utility
which
argued
it
would
be
forced
to
shut
coal
and
nuclear
plants
and
pass
along
those
costs
to
customers
a
similar
measure
backed
by
steyer
in
nevada
passed
on
wednesday
steyer
said
the
failure
in
arizona
was
due
to
the
way
the
measure
was
described
on
the
ballot
implying
the
change
could
drive
up
costs
for
consumers
and
which
had
been
written
by
the
state
s
republican
attorney
general
what
we
saw
in
terms
of
the
ballot
initiatives
is
that
americans
in
purple
states
support
clean
energy
overwhelmingly
as
long
as
you
are
allowed
to
talk
honestly
about
it
steyer
said
referring
to
states
where
the
democratic
and
republican
parties
have
similar
levels
of
support
shares
in
oil
producers
operating
in
colorado
rallied
on
wednesday
after
the
state
s
proposed
drilling
restrictions
failed
anadarko
petroleum
corp
gained
percent
and
noble
energy
inc
jumped
percent
we
think
the
wide
margin
of
victory
matters
and
that
it
will
serve
as
a
deterrent
to
those
who
might
otherwise
decide
to
fund
another
round
of
opposition
to
the
industry
in
the
next

advisors
wrote
in
a
wednesday
note
about
the
colorado
measure
colorado
s
proposal
would
have
required
new
oil
wells
to
be
at
least
feet
m
five
times
the
current
minimum
separation
from
occupied
or
sensitive
areas
effectively
placing
much
of
the
state
to
new
drilling
we
are
going
to
keep
fighting

group
colorado
rising
which
backed
the
measure
said
on
wednesday
but
opponents
including
colorado
municipal
officials
warned
that
the
measure
would
have
cost
the
state
s
economy
billions
of
dollars
and
would
have
reduced
funding
for
roads
schools
