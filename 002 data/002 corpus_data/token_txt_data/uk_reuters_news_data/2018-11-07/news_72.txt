wall
street
stock
futures
ticked
down
slightly
while
asian
shares
held
very
tight
ranges
early
wednesday
as
investors
awaited
the
results
of
midterm
elections
which
could
see
republicans
lose
their
grip
on
congress
s
futures
dipped
percent
as
the
first
polls
closes
in
parts
of
the
country
in
the
congressional
elections
seen
as
a
referendum

turnout

normally
lower
when
the
presidency
is
not
at

be
the
highest
for
a
midterm
election
in
years
the
opposition
democrats
are
favoured
by
election
forecasters
to
pick
up
the
seats
they
need
to
gain
a
majority
in
the
house
but
have
slimmer
chances
of
gaining
control
of
the
senate
opinion
polls
show
we
like
many
other
market
players
expect
democrats
to
take
the
house
and
to
have
a
split
congress
that
should
mean
trump
won
t
be
able
to
push
for
further
tax
cuts
and
could
lead
to
a
mood
in
markets
said
masahiro
ichikawa
senior
strategist
at
sumitomo
mitsui
asset
management
but
that
is
probably
already
factored
in
so
i
would
think
any
additional
selling
in
stocks
would
be
limited
he
said
many
investors
also
expect
trump
to
continue
to
take
a
hard
line
on
tariffs
which
he
can
impose
without
congressional
approval
that
keeps
alive

about
a
trade

between
china
and
the
united

trump
s
massive
tax
cut
enacted
in
december
and
a
spending
agreement
reached
in
february

helped
lift
the

they
