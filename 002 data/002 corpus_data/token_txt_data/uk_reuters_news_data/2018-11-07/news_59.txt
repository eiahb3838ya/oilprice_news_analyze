feet
m
of
separation

new
drilling
activities
and
occupied
or
vulnerable
areas
it
garnered
about
percent

three

local
tax
revenues
by

was
up
percent

according
to
the

government
figures
this

was
an
extreme
proposal

devastating
impacts
across
the
state
on
jobs
education
and
numerous
other
programs
said
chip

a

and
reduce

was
another
setback
for

in
failed
to
get
a
similar
initiative
placed
on
the
ballot
colorado
rising
an
group
that
helped
get
the
measure
on
the
ballot
was
vastly
outspent
but
campaigned

text
messages
to
sway
voters
the
outcome
does
not
change
the
fact
fracking
operations
are
dangerous
and
should
not
be
happening
so
close
to
colorado
homes
schools
and
drinking
water
said
colorado
rising

will
not
stop
until
our
colorado
neighborhoods
are
safe
from
this
dangerous
industrial
ahead

energy

warned
passage
ultimately
could
lead
them
to
reduce
drilling
in
the
state
although
several
said
they
expected
no
immediate
impact
