washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
said
on
wednesday
he
expects
to
meet
again
with
north
korea
s
leader
kim
jong
un
early
next
year
and
that
a
meeting
between
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
and
north
korean
officials
supposed
to
have
taken
place
this
week
would
be
rescheduled
pompeo
had
been
due
to
hold
talks
in
new
york
on
thursday
with
senior
north
korean
official
kim
yong
chol
aimed
at
paving
the
way
for
a
second
summit
between
trump
and
kim
jong
un
and
at
making
progress
on
denuclearization
the
state
department
said
early
on
wednesday
that
the
meeting
had
been
postponed
but
gave
no
reason
raising
concerns
that
talks
aimed
at
persuading
north
korea
to
give
up
its
nuclear
arms
could
break
down
the
state
department
said
the
talks
would
be
rescheduled
when
our
respective
schedules
trump
told
a
white
house
news
conference
the
change
was
because
of
trips
that
are
being
made
but
did
not
elaborate
on
we
are
going
to
make
it
another
day
he
said
but
we
re
very
happy
with
how
it
s
going
with
north
korea
we
think
it
s
going
fine
we
re
in
no
trump
said
he
still
expected
to
hold
a
second
summit
with
kim
some
time
next
year
i
would
say
sometime
early
next
year
he
said
kim
pledged
to
work
towards
denuclearization
at
an
unprecedented
first
meeting
with
trump
in
singapore
but
negotiations
have
made
little
headway
since
with
north
korea
falling
short
of
demands
for
irreversible
moves
to
abandon
a
weapons
program
that
potentially
threatens
the
united
states
pyongyang
has
complained
that
washington
has
not
made
concessions
in
return
for
the
moves
it
has
taken
and
last
friday
warned
it
could
resume
development
of
its
nuclear
program
if
the
united
states
did
not
drop
its
sanctions
campaign
the
trump
administration
has
said
that
sanctions
will
not
be
lifted
until
north
korea
gives
up
its
weapons
the
sanctions
are
on
i
d
love
to
take
the
sanctions
off
but
they
north
korea
have
to
be
responsive
too
trump
said
on
wednesday
the
state
department
said
conversations
continue
to
take
place
with
north
korea
and
added
the
united
states
remains
focused
on
fulfilling
the
commitments
agreed
to
by
president
trump
and
chairman
kim
at
the
singapore
summit
in
south
korea
which
has
worked
to
encourage
korea
dialogue
sought
to
play
down
the
talks
delay
south
korean
foreign
minister
kang
said
on
thursday
the
north
had
suggested
a
postponement
the
north
side
said
both
of
our
schedules
are
busy
so
let
s
postpone
kang
said
according
what
she
was
told
by
the
united
states
presidential
spokesman
kim
said
seoul
did
not
believe
it
would
mean
that
the
second
summit
would
not
take
place
and
a
senior
south
korean
foreign
ministry
official
said
that
while
the
rescheduling
was
regrettable
there
was
no
need
to
overthink
the
postponement
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
it
as
a
part
of
the
process
of
reaching
complete
denuclearization
and
setting
up
a
peace
regime
the
unnamed
official
told
reporters
trump
spoke
after
his
republican
party
lost
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
on
tuesday
after
the
democrats
rode
a
wave
of
dissatisfaction
with
his
presidency
in
elections
some
analysts
believe
this
weakened
state
could
impact
trump
s
foreign
policy
and
test
his
north
korean
diplomatic
gambit
while
republicans
maintained
control
of
the
senate
the
democrats
now
have
the
opportunity
to
block
trump
s
agenda
and
open
his
administration
to
intense
scrutiny
democrats
have
said
they
are
determined
to
obtain
more
information
about
meetings
between
trump
and
pompeo
and
kim
worried
that
trump
is
so
eager
to
make
a
great
deal
that
he
will
give
kim
too
much
with
little
in
return
north
korea
has
for
years
pursued
nuclear
and
missile
programs
in
defiance
of
security
council
resolutions
but
the
bellicose
rhetoric
from
both
pyongyang
and
trump
that
raised
fears
of
war
has
eased
this
year
