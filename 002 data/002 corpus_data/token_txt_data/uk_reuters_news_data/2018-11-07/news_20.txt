billions
of
dollars
in
fines
owed
by
south
african
companies
mtn
and
standard
bank
to
nigerian
regulators
could
increase
the
risk
to
south
africa
s
financial
system
the
central
bank
said
on
wednesday
the
nigerian
central
bank
in
august
accused
telecoms
firm
mtn
and
its
lender
stanbic
a
standard
bank
subsidiary
of
illegally
sending
billion
abroad
the
nigerian
government
has
also
demanded
billion
in
related
taxes
from
mtn
the
south
african
mobile
operator
makes
about
a
third
of
its
annual
core
profit
in
the
west
african
country
the
south
african
reserve
bank
sarb
said
in
its
review
of
financial
stability
that
the
repatriation
claim
and
the
billion
underpayment
in
tax
amounted
to
approximately
percent
of
mtn
s
market
capitalisation
any
potential
impact
on
the
south
african
financial
system
arising
from
this
event
will
depend
on
the
eventual
resolution
of
the
matters
raised
and
mtn
group
s
ability
to
continue
meeting
its
debt
obligations
the
bank
said
a
potential
scenario
would
be
for
the
mtn
group
to
disinvest
from
nigeria
the
central
bank
added
in
october
a
nigerian
judge
set
a
hearing
for
the
dispute
for
some
analysts
have
cited
the
concentrated
foreign
currency
funding
risk
posed
by
mtn
and
a
clutch
of
other
johannesburg
stock
firms
as
a
threat
to
the
currency
and
the
central
bank
s
foreign
exchange
reserves
the
central
bank
said
that
if
there
were
a
spillover
from
the
market
turmoil
linked
to
external
debt
and
the
foreign
currency
funding
crunch
that
hit
turkey
and
argentina
earlier
this
year
south
africa
could
suffer
sharp
capital
outflows
and
exchange
rate
depreciation
the
rand
is
already
down
around
percent
against
the
dollar
this
year
while
portfolio
flows
slumped
dramatically
in
the
first
half
as
a
local
recession
exacerbated
the
global
flight
from
emerging
markets
