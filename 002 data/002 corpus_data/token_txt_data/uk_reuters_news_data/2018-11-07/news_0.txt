earlier
this
year
it
granted
temporary
exemptions
to
eight
countries
allowing
them
to
continue
importing
iranian
oil
although
it
said
the
ultimate
goal
is
to
completely
halt
exports
from
iran
hook
declined
to
give
details
of
the
confidential
bilateral
deals
with
the
countries
which
include
china
india
south
korea
taiwan
japan
greece
italy
and
turkey
the
deputy
head
of
iran
s
elite
revolutionary
guards
brigadier
general
hossein
salami
said
on
wednesday
that
his
country
can
flourish
under
sanctions
and
would
defeat
the
united
states
in
the
economic
war
we
have
been
very
careful
about
applying
maximum
economic
pressure
on
iran
without
lifting
the
price
of
oil
and
we
have
done
that
successfully
hook
told
reporters
we
are
going
to
be
continuing
our
path
to
zero
hook
said
we
do
want
to
achieve
maximum
pressure
without
harming
friends
or
allies
and
we
don
t
want
to
lift
the
price
of
oil
we
have
calibrated
this
very
iran
s
exports
peaked
at
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
april
including
bpd
of
condensate
a
lighter
form
of
oil
overall
exports
have
since
fallen
to
million
bpd
according
to
energy
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
which
estimates
volumes
dropping
to
million
bpd
oil
prices
in
october
rallied
above
per
barrel
on
fears
of
a
steep
decline
in
iranian
exports
and
have
fallen
since
then
on
wednesday
oil
slipped
after
crude
output
hit
another
record
and
domestic
inventories
rose
more
than
expected
asked
if
the
administration
had
a
target
in
reducing
iranian
oil
exports
in
the
next
six
months
hook
said
i
can
t
tell
you
what
our
target
is
we
do
have
a
he
added
that
the
ultimate
aim
was
to
halt
iranian
exports
entirely
he
said
the
united
states
expected
increased
global
oil
supply
in
surpassing
demand
which
would
better
position
washington
to
ask
iranian
oil
importers
to
reduce
purchases
to
zero
washington
s
maximum
pressure
strategy
would
also
apply
to
the
escrow
accounts
holding
iranian
oil
revenues
hook
said
adding
that
the
treasury
department
would
ensure
that
the
accounts
are
never
used
for
illicit
goods
we
will
police
these
very
aggressively
he
added
hook
raised
the
possibility
that
countries
and
port
operators
could
face
penalties
for
facilitating
iran
s
illicit
activities
if
they
allowed
iranian
ships
access
to
international
waterways
and
port
facilities
iran
regularly
shipped
millions
of
barrels
of
crude
to
syria
in
support
of
syrian
president
bashar
he
said
hook
said
iranian
vessels
would
lose
access
to
international
insurance
markets
under
sanctions
from
the
suez
canal
to
the
strait
of
malacca
and
all
in
between
iranian
tankers
are
a
floating
liability
hook
said
iranian
tankers
are
a
risk
to
the
ports
that
permit
them
to
dock
the
canals
that
allow
them
to
transit
and
the
boat
that
cross
their
path
this
exposes
the
entire
maritime
shipping
network
to
immense
