japan
s
nuclear
regulator
has
approved
an
operations
extension
for
a
reactor
near
tokyo
that
was
damaged
in
the
same
earthquake
and
tsunami
that
sparked
the
fukushima
disaster
nearly
eight
years
ago
a
move
likely
to
be
controversial
the
reactor
tokai
daini
also
has
the
same
basic
design
as
those
that
melted
down
in
the
fukushima
crisis
and
will
be
the
first
boiling
water
reactor
bwr
to
be
approved
for
a
lifetime
extension
of
years
the
approval
will
be
a
boost
for
operator
japan
atomic
power
co
japco
which
is
owned
by
the
country
s
main
utilities
and
is
bleeding
cash
because
of
the
shutdown
of
its
two
nuclear
power
units
japan
s
nuclear
regulation
authority
gave
the
green
light
to
the
extension
on
wednesday
the
regulator
said
tokai
daini
is
km
miles
northeast
of
central
tokyo
the
closest
reactor
to
the
capital
and
has
nearly
a
million
people
living
within
a
kilometre
radius
it
s
impossible
to
evacuate
these
people
all
at
once
and
no
matter
how
much
time
is
spent
on
them
it
won
t
be
possible
to
set
up
escape
plans
said
toru
umino
mayor
of
nearby
naka
city
on
to
a
group
of
citizens
opposed
to
nuclear
power
according
to
a
video
posted
on
local
media
umino
has
been
one
of
the
few
public
officials
to
come
out
in
opposition
to
the
tokai
daini
extension
a
call
to
mayoral
staff
on
wednesday
went
unanswered
after
office
hours
naka
is
one
of
five
municipalities
near
tokai
village
where
the
reactor
is
located
that
have
an
agreement
with
japco
to
be
consulted
on
any
restart
although
they
don
t
have
veto
rights
tokai
also
has
atomic
research
and
other
facilities
and
was
the
site
of
a
nuclear
crisis
in
when
workers
at
a
processing
plant
not
connected
to
tokai
daini
attempted
to
mix
uranium
in
a
bucket
two
workers
died
and
people
were
told
to
stay
indoors
for
up
to
hours
after
radiation
escape
into
surrounding
areas
at
the
time
it
was
the
world
s
worst
nuclear
incident
since
chernobyl
in
based
on
an
international
rating
scale
local
opposition
to
the
extension
of
the
tokai
plant
has
been
strong
according
to
japanese
media
although
residents
often
will
not
give
their
views
it
s
very
difficult
to
express
one
s
opinions
around
here
said
alison
watts
an
australian
who
works
as
a
translator
and
has
lived
in
tokai
for
years
watts
said
she
was
opposed
to
the
restart
because
the
design
of
the
reactors
is
similar
to
those
at
fukushima
and
because
of
the
threat
of
more
big
earthquakes
a
company
spokesman
told
reuters
the
nuclear
operator
will
build
a
tsunami
protection
wall
to
fortify
tokai
daini
japan
atomic
must
also
complete
safety
upgrades
with
a
restart
of
the
plant
is
not
expected
till
the
japan
atomic
will
need
the
approval
of
tokai
and
prefectural
authorities
as
well
before
it
can
resume
operations
tokai
daini
was
operating
when
a
massive
earthquake
struck
off
the
northeast
coast
of
japan
on
march
creating
a
tsunami
that
swamped
tokyo
electric
power
s
fukushima
daichi
station
kilometres
to
the
north
causing
explosions
and
meltdowns
at
three
reactors
the
tokai
daini
plant
shut
down
automatically
but
sustained
damage
according
to
japan
atomic
while
the
extension
will
be
a
further
boost
for
japan
s
resurgent
nuclear
industry
the
sector
will
still
miss
a
government
target
of
providing
at
least
a
fifth
of
the
country
s
electricity
by
an
analysis
by
reuters
showed
last
week
nine
reactors
have
restarted
all
of
them
pressurized
water
reactors
located
far
from
tokyo
while
the
stigma
of
fukushima
still
hangs
over
use
of
the
older
bwr
technology
