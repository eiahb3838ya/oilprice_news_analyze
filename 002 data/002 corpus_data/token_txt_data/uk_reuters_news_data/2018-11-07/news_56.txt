wall
street
stock
futures
and
asian
shares
lost
steam
on
wednesday
after
democrats
won
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
boosting
the
party
s
ability
to
block
president
donald
trump
s
political
and
economic
agenda
but
european
stocks
were
expected
to
rise
with
looking
at
gains
of
up

the
democrats
house
win
creates
a
hurdle
for
republicans
to
easily
pass
legislation
through
both
chambers
of
congress
clouding
the
outlook
for
some
of
trump
s
key
economic
proposals
major
broadcasters
projected
the
democrats
were
headed
to
a
gain
of
more
than
seats
well
beyond
the
they
needed
to
claim
their
first
majority
in
the
house
in
eight
years
while
the
republicans
were
seen
gaining
a
few
more
seats
in
the
senate
while
both
outcomes
were
broadly
in
line
with
market
expectations
a
reason
markets
did
not
sell
off
the
prospect
of
political
gridlock
creates
some
uncertainty
for
investors
the
dollar
weakened
against
most
of
its
major
counterparts
in
the
short
term
a
republican
loss
in
the
house
should
amplify
risk
market
volatility
detract
from
positive
sentiment
and
be
positive
for
rates
said
ed

rates
and
currency
analyst

columbia
threadneedle
investments

minneapolis
in
the
united
states
long
dollar
and
short
treasury
futures
positioning
is
relatively
stretched
going
into
tonight
and
could
exaggerate
short
term
moves
in
these
prices
he
added
in
addition
the
newly
empowered
house
democrats
will
have
the
ability
to
investigate
trump
s
tax
returns
possible
business
conflicts
of
interest
and
allegations
involving
his
campaign

msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
were
up
a
similar
amount
but
they
were
far
off
highs
hit
earlier
japan
s
nikkei
ended
down
percent
giving
up
morning
gains
it
has
clearly
become
difficult
for
republicans
to
pass
additional
tax
cuts
or
amendments
to
regulations
on
financial
institutions
for
instance
said
tomoaki
shishido
fixed
income
analyst
at
nomura
securities
market
sentiment
had
been
volatile
in
asian
trade
with
stocks
and
the
dollar
swinging
on
the
republicans
fluctuating
prospects
of
retaining
the
house
while
a
split
congress
would
put
a
brake
on
trump
s
agenda
such
as
tax
cuts
or
deregulation
some
investors
think
the
democrats
may
agree
to
more
spending
there
are
still
areas
with
compromise
for
spending
so
even
with
a
split
government
i
expect
more
fiscal
stimulus
ahead
there
is
some
possibility
for
compromise
on
infrastructure
spending
as
well
said
steve
friedman
new
senior
economist
at
bnp
paribas
asset
management
if
there
is
additional
fiscal
stimulus
it
suggests
that
fiscal
policy
is
more
of
a
tailwind
for
growth
and
it
should
all
things
equal
be
supportive
for
on
the
other
hand
many
investors
expect
trump
to
continue
to
take
a
hard
line
on
tariffs
which
he
can
impose
without
congressional
approval
and
foreign
policy
that
keeps
alive
worries
about
a
trade
war
between
china
and
the
united
states
trump
s
massive
tax
cut
enacted
in
december
and
a
spending
agreement
reached
in
congress
in
february
have
helped
lift
the
economy
but
they
have
also
widened
the
federal
budget
deficit
as
a
result

been
growing
