canada
s
government
got
just
hours
notice
that
it
would
be
thrust
into
a
political
and
economic
crisis
by
an
ultimatum
from
a
pipeline
operator
government
sources
said
leaving
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
scrambling
for
options
in
a
dispute
that
could
damage
his
chances
the
kinder
morgan
canada
pipeline
issue
has
pitted
ottawa
against
the
pacific
province
of
british
columbia
and
could
turn
into
a
constitutional
crisis
derail
trudeau
s
energy
strategy
and
dent
business
confidence
trudeau
broke
off
a
foreign
trip
to
hold
an
emergency
meeting
on
sunday
with
the
premiers
of
two
provinces
locked
in
a
standoff
over
the
pipeline
after
the
company
set
a
may
deadline
to
resolve
the
impasse
or
it
would
walk
away
federal
officials
had
been
talking
to
the
company
since
february
when
british
columbia
s
coalition
which
includes
the
green
party
made
clear
it
would
delay
the
planned
expansion
of
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
from
alberta
s
oil
sands
to
the
coast
but
the
government
had
no
idea
that
kinder
morgan
canada
was
about
to
drop
a
bombshell
kinder
morgan
s
announcement
on
sunday
was
unexpected
said
a
senior
government
official
who
declined
to
be
identified
given
the
sensitivity
of
the
situation
we
had
hours
the
move
by
kinder
morgan
canada
which
was
spun
off
by
its
parent
last
year
puts
pressure
on
trudeau
to
solve
the
problem
without
alienating
voters
in
british
columbia
or
presiding
over
an
investment
failure
ahead
of
elections
a
second
federal
government
source
said
the
prime
minister
and
senior
cabinet
members
had
worked
behind
the
scenes
for
weeks
pressing
british
columbia
to
change
its
position
if
we
re
talking
of
things
going
awry
british
columbia
knew
this
was
federal
jurisdiction
said
the
source
the
operator
wants
to
almost
triple
the
capacity
of
the
existing
pipeline
ottawa
which
approved
the
project
in
insists
it
has
jurisdiction
british
columbia
s
government
elected
in
disagrees
citing
the
risk
of
a
spill
i
do
believe
we
have
a
mandate
to
defend
the
coast
provincial
premier
john
horgan
told
reporters
on
friday
trudeau
won
power
in
partly
thanks
to
extra
seats
his
liberals
won
in
british
columbia
as
well
as
increased
support
from
environmentalists
cracking
down
too
hard
would
cost
him
support
in
both
camps
leaving
him
with
a
weak
minority
government
in
the
october
elections
tensions
over
the
pipeline
meant
liberals
in
british
columbia
were
already
nervous
about
softening
support
before
kinder
morgan
canada
s
ultimatum
said
a
liberal
party
official
the
liberals
also
have
to
pick
up
seats
in
the
province
of
quebec
which
has
a
strong
green
tradition
it
wouldn
t
really
take
a
lot
to
tip
the
government
into
minority
territory
said
pollster
nik
nanos
of
nanos
research
if
you
re
looking
at
hard
political
calculus
the
prime
minister
realistically
has
to
tilt
in
favor
of
the
environment
because
if
he
doesn
t
that
will
kill
him
in
during
sunday
s
meeting
trudeau
will
lay
out
the
various
financial
regulatory
and
legal
options
said
the
second
government
source
it
s
not
a
matter
of
getting
angry
or
being
mean
or
nice
about
it
he
will
lay
out
the
facts
said
the
source
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
the
federal
and
alberta
governments
both
say
they
could
take
a
stake
in
the
pipeline
to
keep
the
project
alive
with
alberta
s
premier
saying
her
province
could
even
buy
it
outright
kinder
morgan
canada
has
said
it
was
open
to
discussions
but
did
not
elaborate
the
first
government
source
there
was
a
huge
gray
zone
of
possible
government
help
citing
the
past
bailout
of
the
auto
industry
in
federal
loan
guarantees
for
a
project
and
ottawa
s
investment
in
an
offshore
energy
project
bank
deputy
chairman
frank
mckenna
a
member
of
alberta
s
pipeline
advisory
taskforce
said
he
raised
the
issue
with
trudeau
in
a
recent
call
and
that
ottawa
has
to
provide
deal
certainty
a
backstop
that
could
be
something
in
the
nature
of
an
indemnity
agreement
or
a
guarantee
against
potential
losses
that
would
come
from
political
instability
and
not
based
on
normal
construction
risk
said
mckenna
a
former
premier

new
brunswick

kinder
morgan
canada
s
biggest
lender
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
pipeline
can
t
be
allowed
to
fail
it
would
be
a
huge
blow
to
the
leadership
of
the
