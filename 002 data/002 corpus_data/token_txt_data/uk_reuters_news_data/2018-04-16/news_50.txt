tokyo
reuters
japanese
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
could
find
his
close
ties
with
donald
trump
sorely
tested
at
a
summit
this
week
in
which
tokyo
fears
the
leader
will
to
try
to
link
vital
security
matters
with
touchy
trade
topics
it
is
a
fraught
time
for
both
sides
and
comes
as
trump
prepares
to
meet
with
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
whose
government
has
been
openly
antagonistic
toward
japan
abe
is
struggling
with
declining
popularity
because
of
suspected
cronyism
scandals
trump
whose
white
house
is
grappling
with
scandals
and
investigations
of
its
own
may
be
hunting
for
a
political
win
ahead
of
november
midterm
congressional
elections
japan
wants
trump
to
avoid
a
deal
in
which
pyongyang
gives
up
ballistic
missiles
that
can
hit
the
mainland
but
keeps
missiles
that
threaten
japan
abe
also
wants
trump
to
bring
up
japanese
citizens
kidnapped
by
pyongyang
long
ago
at
the
summit
with
trump
on
tuesday
and
wednesday
tokyo
is
equally
eager
to
avoid
being
pushed
into
talks
on
a
free
trade
agreement
aimed
not
only
at
market
access
but
at
monetary
and
currency
policies
if
abe
brings
up
abductions
and
short
and
missiles
it
s
obvious
that
trump
will
say
ok
do
something
on
the
economic
side
said
a
japanese
ruling
party
lawmaker
in
ties
who
declined
to
be
identified
because
the
topic
and
timing
are
sensitive
trump
s
ability
to
give
allies
policy
whiplash
was
on
display
last
week
when
he
said
he
d
asked
aides
to
talks
on
the
multinational
trans
pacific
partnership
tpp
that
he
abandoned
last
year
afterward
he
tweeted
that
the
united
states
would
only
rejoin
if
offered
substantially
better
terms
and
urged
a
bilateral
deal
with
japan
which
has
hit
us
hard
on
trade
for
years
eleven
remaining
members
led
by
japan
signed
a
agreement
in
march
tokyo
has
long
hoped
washington
would
return
to
tpp
but
is
opposed
to
any
major
makeover
of
the
pact
to
help
that
happen
what
trump
wants
most
is
a
success
story
and
that
means
bringing
japan
into
bilateral
economic
talks
the
lawmaker
said
trump
s
decision
to
include
japan
as
a
target
for
tariffs
on
its
steel
exports
while
exempting
several
other
countries
was
widely
seen
as
pressure
on
japan
to
agree
to
a
deal
japan
will
propose
a
new
framework
to
discuss
trade
issues
with
washington
as
a
way
to
coax
it
back
to
tpp
the
nikkei
business
daily
said
on
saturday
ongoing
talks
led
by
vice
president
mike
pence
and
japanese
deputy
prime
minister
taro
aso
have
produced
few
results
but
such
a
proposal
would
face
headwinds
if
trump
insists
on
renegotiating
the
tpp
or
tries
to
push
tokyo
into
a
pact
tpp
achieved
the
impossible
if
they
want
to
rebalance
or
change
it
is
very
delicate
and
i
don
t
see
a
realistic
possibility
of
going
further
in
any
way
said
a
japanese
government
source
who
also
declined
to
be
identified
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
topic
abe
who
was
the
first
foreign
leader
to
meet
trump
after
his
election
and
has
since
held
two
summits
both
of
which
included
chummy
rounds
of
golf
sought
this
week
s
meeting
after
trump
stunned
tokyo
with
his
willingness
meet
kim
jong
un
a
senior
administration
official
told
reporters
in
washington
that
the
two
countries
were
cooperating
from
the
top
down
we
manage
frictions
as
they
come
and
i
think
overall
the
relationship
has
never
been
better
the
official
said
japanese
officials
fear
the
midterm
elections
this
year
and
other
domestic
headaches
are
making
trump
especially
keen
for
success
both
in
talks
with
north
korea
and
on
the
economic
front
where
he
has
threatened
a
trade
war
with
china
and
pressed
south
korea
into
revising
a
bilateral
deal
the
midterm
elections
are
foremost
in
trump
s
mind
katsuyuki
kawai
a
special
ruling
liberal
democratic
party
ldp
adviser
for
foreign
affairs
to
abe
told
reuters
this
is
precisely
the
time
when
allies
must
join
together
on
security
matters
to
face
north
korea
kawai
added
abe
may
find
the
talks
complicated
by
his
efforts
to
improve
ties
with
russia
and
china
while
being
likely
to
join
trump
in
criticising
some
of
beijing
s
trade
practices
abe
is
expected
to
meet
russian
president
vladimir
putin
in
may
to
seek
progress
in
a
territorial
dispute
on
saturday
abe
expressed
support
for
the
resolve
of
the
united
states
britain
and
france
to
halt
chemical
weapons
use
but
only
understanding
for
their
attacks
on
syria
which
putin
has
denounced
given
trump
s
propensity
for
diplomatic
experts
advised
abe
to
steer
clear
of
details
at
the
summit
we
don
t
want
to
turn
the
whole
thing
into
bargaining
between
the
united
states
and
japan
