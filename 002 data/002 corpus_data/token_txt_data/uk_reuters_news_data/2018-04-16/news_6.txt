vancouver
april
reuters
alberta
officials
will
introduce
legislation
on
monday
expected
to
give
the
provincial
government
power
to
cut
oil
shipments
to
neighboring
british
columbia
in
an
escalation
of
a
row
over
the
stalled
expansion
of
a
kinder
morgan
canada
pipeline
which
the
pacific
province
opposes
the
trans
mountain
expansion
issue
has
pitted
ottawa
against
british
columbia
it
could
turn
into
a
constitutional
crisis
derail
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
s
energy
strategy
and
dent
business
confidence
alberta
s
legislation
slated
for
monday
afternoon
could
make
gasoline
more
expensive
in
british
columbia
and
comes
a
day
after
an
emergency
summit
to
unlock
the
stalemate
failed
on
sunday
trudeau
pledged
financial
aid
to
the
c
billion
billion
project
reiterating
ottawa
has
jurisdiction
over
it
and
it
will
be
built
but
shortly
after
the
summit
ended
premier
john
horgan
tweeted
i
will
continue
to
fight
to
defend
jobs
our
economy
and
environment
now
and
for
future
horgan
campaigned
on
a
pledge
to
block
the
expansion
which
would
nearly
triple
capacity
on
the
existing
pipeline
from
alberta
to
s
coast
trudeau
said
his
government
would
draft
legislation
which
is
unlikely
to
come
for
several
weeks
to
reaffirm
federal
jurisdiction
over
the
issue
the
legislation
and
financial
aid
have
the
same
aim
of
making
sure
that
one
that
this
pipeline
will
be
built
and
two
that
all
of
the
investors
involved
know
that
we
take
this
seriously
and
they
can
be
confident
it
will
go

we
continue
to
regard
the
calculus
as
fraught

believe
the
failure

challenges
make
the

analysts
said
in
a
research
note
on
monday
oil
producers
and
the
alberta
government
are
desperate
for
the
pipeline
to
go
ahead
as
rising
production
has
outstripped
existing
pipeline
capacity
leading
to
a
widening
of
the
normal
differential
between
western
canadian
oil
prices
and
the
benchmark
canadian
dollars
