the

running

the

told

the
final
results
of
demand
for
buying
capacities
in
the

will
be

on

lng
hrvatska
is
preparing
to

croatia
hopes
will
start
operations
in

the

the

european
union
efforts
to

imports
most

for
countries
in

million
the
jutarnji
list
daily
reported
over
the

sources
familiar
to
the
process
that
demand
reached
only
four
percent
of
overall
capacity
in
the
first
round
of
the
tender
given
the
confidentiality
of
the
procedure
we
can
not
comment
on
the
first
round
results
but
with
a
knowledge
of
how
the
gas
traders
operate
we
can
expect
their
active
involvement
in
the
following
rounds
as
the
first
round
usually
revolves
around
testing
the
market
and
competition
