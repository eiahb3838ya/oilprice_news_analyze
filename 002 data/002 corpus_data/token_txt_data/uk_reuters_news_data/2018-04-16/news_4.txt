new

reuters
oil
prices
dropped
on
monday
as
investor
concern
waned
about
escalating
tensions
in
the
middle
east
following
air
strikes
on
syria
over
the
weekend
the
united
states
france
and
britain
launched
missiles
on
saturday
targeting
what
they
said
were
three
chemical
weapons
facilities
in
syria
in
retaliation
for
a
suspected
poison
gas
attack
on
april
oil
prices
had
risen
nearly
percent
in
the
to
the
strikes
as
investors
bulked
up
on
assets
such
as
gold
or
treasuries
that
can
shield
against
geopolitical
risks
some
of
the
ease
in
syria
is
the
headline
that
is
bringing
it
down
said
phil
streible
senior
market
strategist
at
rjo
futures
in
chicago
because
the
attacks
were
more
surgical
than
anticipated
in
more
extreme
scenarios
the
market
has
shrugged
off
bullish
factors
he
said
it
has
got
everything
to
possibly
boost

oil
futures
settled
down
at
while
crude
futures
were
down
at
a
barrel
as
far
as
developments
in
syria
are
concerned
the
market
has
had
a
sigh
of
relief
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
escalation
either
diplomatically
or
on
the
ground
following
the
intervention
by
the
france
and
the
uk
said
bnp
paribas
global
head
of
commodity
market
strategy
harry
tchilinguirian
as
a
macro
if
you
want
to
hedge
your
portfolio
against
geopolitical
risk
your
prime
candidate
is
oil
especially
if
that
risk
is
in
the
middle
although
syria
itself
is
not
a
significant
oil
producer
the
wider
middle
east
is
the
world
s
most
important
crude
exporter
and
tension
in
the
region
tends
to
put
oil
markets
on
edge
investors
continued
to
worry
about
the
impact
of
a
wider
conflict
in
the
middle
east
anz
bank
said
fund
managers
hold
more
brent
futures
and
options
than
at
any
time
since
records
began
in
according
to
data
from
the
intercontinental
exchange
investors
have
added
to
their
bullish
positions
in
brent
which
now
equal
nearly
million
barrels
of
oil
in
nine
out
of
the
last
months
the
next
event
on
investors
radar
is
potential
withdrawal
from
a
deal
on
iran
s
nuclear
restrictions
signed
in
president
donald
trump
has
threatened
to
withdraw
the
united
states
from
the
pact
barring
action
from
congress
and
europe
even
the
imposition
of
unilateral
sanctions
by
the
government
could
hamper
exports
of
oil
from
iran
one
of
the
world
s
largest
producers
oil
is
still
holding
relatively
well
and
the
iranian
deadline
is
going
to
be
a
bit
of
a
subject
for
the
next
four
weeks
