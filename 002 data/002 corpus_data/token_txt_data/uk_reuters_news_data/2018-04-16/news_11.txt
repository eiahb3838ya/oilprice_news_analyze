venezuela
s
oil
refineries
worked
at
percent
of
their
combined
capacity
in
the
first
quarter
well
below
levels
according
to
an
internal
document
from
firm
pdvsa
viewed
by
reuters
pdvsa
s
refining
operations
have
been
degraded
in
recent
years
due
to
lack
of
cash
for
spare
parts
and
maintenance
and
insufficient
light
oil
for
the
facilities
staff
departures
which
have
particularly
affected
the
firm
s
refineries
have
become
the
most
recent
obstacle
to
sustaining
output
levels
the
company
s
amuay
cardon
isla
puerto
la
cruz
and
el
palito
refineries
processed
bpd
of
crude
in
the
first
quarter
down
sharply
from
a
bpd
average
in
all
of
the
document
said
the
very
low
processing
rate
worse
than
in
mexico
where
growing
fuel
imports
have
displaced
domestic
production
has
led
to
a
lack
of
refined
products
to
fulfill
the
country
s
export
commitments
according
to
the
report
in
may
pdvsa
will
face
a
deficit
of
bpd
mainly
diesel
and
jet
for
export
contracts
even
though
venezuela
s
fuel
consumption
this
year
has
remained
well
below
the
peak
of
bpd
registered
a
decade
ago
declining
domestic
demand
should
have
left
a
surplus
for
shipping
abroad
instead
the
deficit
continues
to
cause
delays
in
exports
with
customers
receiving
only
a
portion
of
the
cargoes
promised
the
lack
of
spare
parts
and
feedstock
to
operate
the
refineries
properly
is
pdvsa
s
most
recurrent
problem
but
a
lack
of
crude
has
become
another
big
issue
forcing
the
firm
to
boost
oil
imports
according
to
the
document
pdvsa
did
not
respond
a
request
for
comment
pdvsa
lowered
its
expectation
for
refining
in
may
compared
with
april
to
bpd
percent
of
capacity
due
to
maintenance
projects
the
firm
was
hoping
to
restart
one
of
the
amuay
refinery
s
five
atmospheric
distillation
units
in
april
but
has
postponed
it
without
setting
a
new
deadline
at
cardon
a
vacuum
distillation
unit
is
out
of
service
while
the
reformer
and
a
diesel
hydrotreater
are
working
with
limitations
at
the
isla
refinery
in
curacao
the
restart
of
several
units
under
maintenance
since
february
and
april
was
delayed
to
may
including
two
crude
units
an
alkylation
unit
a
catalytic
cracker
and
two
hydrotreaters
the
document
showed
at
el
palito
and
puerto
la
cruz
an
acute
lack
of
medium
crude
has
forced
a
halt
to
key
units
