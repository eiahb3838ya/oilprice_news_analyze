a

municipal

voted
in
october
to
privatise
eneco
while
ceo
jeroen
de
haas
and
works
council
chairman
willem
hofman
had
lobbied
against
it
and
pressed
for
conditions
including
preservation
of
its
profile
as
a
business
the
company
said
on
monday
that
de
haas
ceo
since
will
leave
on
eneco
said
its
supervisory
board
reached
the
decision
in
close
consultation
with
de
haas
but
declined
to
clarify
the
reasons
for
his
departure
hours
later
the

it
will
ask

read
a
statement
from
the
company
s
supervisory
board
saying
that
it
is
preparing
for
the
works
council
s
actions
after
months
of
feuding
shareholders
and
eneco
s
boards
had
agreed
in
february
that
the
company
would
be
sold
paving
the
way
for

the
coming
months
details

process
have
not

told

that
the

was
seeking
a
trade
sale

still
fears
a
sale
to
a
party
that
would
harm
its
sustainable
profile
basically
it
comes
down

to
be
bought
by
a
company

eneco
estimated
to
be
worth
about
billion
euros

heavily
invested
