government
watchdogs
rapped
two
members
of
president
donald
trump
s
cabinet
on
monday
over
their
spending
last
year
adding
pressure
on
an
administration
already
roiled
by
ethics
complaints
the
government
accountability
office
gao
said
the
environmental
protection
agency
violated
the
law
when
it
approved
a
soundproof
phone
booth
last
year
for
administrator
scott
pruitt
without
seeking
approval
from
lawmakers
and
the
department
of
interior
s
office
of
inspector
general
said
interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
took
an
unnecessary
charter
flight
in
june
after
a
speech
he
made
there
to
a
professional
hockey
team
that
cost
taxpayers
more
than
the
new
reports
come
as
the
white
house
seeks
to
shake
off
persistent
criticism
by
lawmakers
of
ethical
lapses
and
wasteful
spending
by
trump
s
senior
officials
something
that
has
helped
fuel
a
high
rate
of
turnover
health
secretary
tom
price
was
forced
out
and
replaced
last
year
after
reports
emerged
of
lavish
spending
on
flights
pruitt
and
zinke
are
viewed
as
among
trump
s
most
productive
cabinet
officials
and
key
to
the
president
s
policy
of
expanding
energy
production
and
exports
by
slashing
environmental
regulations
and
opening
federal
lands
to
drilling
and
mining
trump
has
rebuffed
recent
calls
by
both
democratic
and
republican
lawmakers
to
fire
pruitt
saying
he
is
doing
a
fantastic
job
and
is
in
coal
and
energy
the
government
accountability
office
said
the
epa
violated
the
financial
services
and
general
government
appropriations
act
with
pruitt
s
privacy
booth
the
law
prohibits
an
agency
from
obligating
more
than
in
federal
funds
to
furnish
redecorate
or
make
improvements
in
the
office
of
a
presidential
appointee
without
first
notifying
appropriations
committees
in
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
liz
bowman
an
epa
spokeswoman
said
the
agency
was
addressing
gao
s
concern
with
regard
to
congressional
notification
about
this
expense
and
will
be
sending
congress
the
necessary
information
this
the
booth
which
pruitt
had
told
lawmakers
in
a
hearing
was
needed
to
conduct
agency
business
was
built
in
a
former
storage
closet
in
the
administrator
s
office
the
gao
had
been
asked
to
investigate
the
matter
by
democratic
lawmakers
senator
john
barrasso
a
republican
and
the
head
of
the
senate
environment
committee
said
in
a
statement
after
the
gao
s
decision
that
pruitt
s
agency
must
give
a
full
public
accounting
of
the
spending
the
white
house
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
also
on
monday
the
epa
s
office
of
inspector
general
released
documents
showing
epa
s
chief
of
staff
ryan
jackson
had
signed
off
on
pay
raises
for
three
of
pruitt
s
staff
including
a
raise
of
to
above
for
his
scheduling
director
millan
hupp
pruitt
had
originally
recommended
the
raises
but
was
denied
by
the
white
house
jackson
approved
them
using
the
authority
granted
under
an
obscure
provision
in
a
clean
water
law
the
documents
said
pruitt
told
fox
news
this
month
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
raises
epa
spokesman
jahan
wilcox
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
the
interior
department
s
watchdog
said
in
its
report
monday
that
secretary
zinke
chartered
a
plane
for
from
las
vegas
to
kalispell
montana
in
june
that
could
have
been
the
flight
was
linked
to
a
controversial
visit
zinke
made
to
a
national
hockey
league
team
owned
by
a
campaign
donor
we
determined
that
zinke
s
use
of
chartered
flights
in
fiscal
year
fy
generally
followed
relevant
law
policy
rules
and
regulations
the
report
said
we
found
however
that
a
chartered
flight
he
took
in
june
after
speaking
at
the
developmental
camp
for
the
golden
knights
a
professional
hockey
team
based
in
las
vegas
nevada
could
have
been
avoided
it
added
the
report
said
the
visit
appeared
unrelated
to
zinke
s
work
as
interior
chief
pointing
out
that
a
video
recording
of
the
speech
showed
he
never
mentioned
his
role
at
the
department
and
focused
mainly
on
his
experience
as
a
navy
seal
the
hockey
team
is
owned
by
bill
foley
a
donor
to
zinke
s
past
congressional
campaigns
heather
swift
an
interior
department
spokeswoman
said
the
report
said
exactly
what
was
known
all
along
that
the
chartered
aircraft
followed
relevant
law
and
regulations
she
did
not
comment
on
the
watchdog
s
finding
that
the
las
vegas
flight
could
have
been
avoided
zinke
has
also
defended
his
use
of
noncommercial
aircraft
as
necessary
for
reaching
the
remote
parts
of
the
country
that
his
department
oversees
and
said
past
interior
secretaries
have
also
relied
on
them
zinke
has
also
taken
heat
for
other
types
of
spending
including
the
repair
of
doors
in
his
office
that
cost
thousands
of
dollars
