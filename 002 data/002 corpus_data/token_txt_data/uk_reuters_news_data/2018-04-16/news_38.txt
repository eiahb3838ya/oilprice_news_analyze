rose
on

that

would
not
mark
the

western
involvement
in
the

european

were
broadly
flat
however
adding
to
a
mixed
picture
in
asian
stock
markets
and
suggesting
that
a
degree
of
caution
prevails

unwound

late
on
friday
there
is
some
relief
that
a
direct
confrontation
between
the

russia
over
syria
has
been
avoided
said
dz

saturday

marked
the
biggest
intervention
by
western
countries
against
syrian
president
bashar
and
his
ally
russia
which
is
facing
further
economic
sanctions
over
its
role
in

the

britain

said
the

syria

across
the

that
was
partly
as
attention
turned
to
what
is
expected
to
be
a
robust
corporate

which
begins
in
