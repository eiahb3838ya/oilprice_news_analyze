will

on
an

the

has
forecast
accurately
only
once
in

over
the

even
after

an

band

rains
usually
lash

trigger
planting

the

in

reach
central
india
s
soybean
areas
by
the
third
week
of
june
and
western
areas
by
the
first
week
of
july
good
rains
would
help
boost
soybean
output
which
in
turn
could
cut
expensive
vegetable
oil
imports
by
india
the
world
s
biggest
importer
of
edible
oils
which
is
the
import
item
after
crude
oil
and
gold
currently
india
is
struggling
with
huge
amounts
of
sugar
and
good
rains
could
further
bump
up
the
supply
of
the
sweetener
a
good
monsoon
will
help
bring
down
edible
oil
imports
but
it
could
also
create
a
problem
of
plenty
in
pulses
and
sugar
said
a
dealer
with
a
global
trading
firm
average
monsoon
rainfall
will
help
india
retain
its
position
as
the

top
rice
exporter
