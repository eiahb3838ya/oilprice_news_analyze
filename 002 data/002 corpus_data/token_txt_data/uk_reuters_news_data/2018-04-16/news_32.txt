india
s
monsoon
rains
are
likely
to
be
percent
of
their
average
in
its
meteorological
department
said
on
monday
reassuring
farmers
ahead
of
summer
planting
in
a
country
where
only
half
of
the
farmland
is
irrigated
what
are
the
categories
of
monsoon
a
normal
or
average
monsoon
means
rainfall
between
percent
and
percent
of
a
average
of
cm
inches
in
total
during
the
monsoon
season
from
june
according
to
the
india
meteorological
department
s
imd
classification
rainfall
below
percent
of
the
average
would
be
classified
as
a
drought
during
prime
minister
narendra
modi
first
two
years
in
office
in
and
there
were
consecutive
droughts
that
led
to
some
criticism
here
due
to
the
government
handling
of
the
issue
rainfall
above
percent
of
the
average
would
mean
an
excessive
monsoon
which
would
not
be
as
damaging
as
a
drought
but
could
be
potentially
harmful
for
the
yields
of
certain
crops
the
monsoon
season
starts
with
rains
on
the
southern
kerala
coast
around
june
covering
the
whole
country
by
the
middle
of
july
why
is
the
monsoon
important
the
monsoon
delivers
about
percent
of
india
s
annual
rainfall
and
determines
the
yield
of
key
crops
such
as
rice
wheat
sugarcane
and
oilseeds
such
as
soybeans
the
farm
sector
accounts
for
about
percent
of
india
s
trillion
economy
but
employs
more
than
half
of
the
country
s
billion
people
if
monsoon
rains
lift
farm
output
it
can
boost
demand
for
consumer
goods
as
it
raises
incomes
of
rural
people
a
stronger
economic
outlook
would
lift
equities
mainly
for
companies
selling
products
in
rural
areas
including
consumer
goods
automobiles
fertilisers
and
pesticides
india
is
in
crops
such
as
rice
and
wheat
but
a
drought
would
require
the
country
to
import
foodstuffs
in
india
imported
sugar
after
poor
rains
sending
global
prices
to
record
highs
and
pushing
up
local
inflation
monsoon
rains
replenish
reservoirs
and
groundwater
allowing
better
irrigation
and
more
hydropower
output
higher
rainfall
can
trim
demand
for
subsidised
diesel
which
is
used
to
pump
water
from
wells
for
irrigation
how
does
the
monsoon
affect
inflation
and
central
bank
policy
food
accounts
for
percent
of
india
s
consumer
price
index
which
the
central
bank
closely
monitors
while
deciding
on
monetary
policy
a
bumper
farm
output
would
keep
food
prices
under
control
during
past
droughts
the
government
supported
farmers
by
giving
out
incentives
straining
the
fiscal
deficit
a
good
monsoon
will
limit
government
spending
on
such
measures
how
reliable
is
the
monsoon
forecast
the
imd
issues
its
first
forecast
typically
more
than
a
month
ahead
of
the
monsoon
s
onset
on
average
its
forecast
has
been
accurate
only
once
every
five
years
over
the
past
two
decades
even
after
taking
into
account
an
error
band
of
plus
or
minus
percentage
points
the
imd
s
forecast
for
the
monsoon
was
its
most
accurate
since
last
year
there
was
a
difference
of
only
percentage
point
between
the
forecast
and
the
actual
rainfall
even
during
normal
monsoon
years
some
parts
of
india
face
drought
while
some
others
suffer
from
floods
the
imd
will
come
out
with
a
second
forecast
for
the
monsoon
rains
in
june
why
is
the
monsoon
important
for
prime
minister
modi
ahead
of
the
elections
modi
who
has
promised
to
double
farmers
income
over
five
years
remains
popular
nearly
four
years
into
his
term
farmer
unrest
however
has
flared
in
some
states
ruled
by
his
party
catching
regional
leaders
a
normal
monsoon
could
lead
to
higher
output
of
crops
helping
state
leaders
placate
farmers
