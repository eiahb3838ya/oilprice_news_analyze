canada
s
alberta
province
on
monday
edged
closer
to
cutting
off
fuel
shipments
to
neighboring
british
columbia
in
an
escalation
of
a
row
over
the
stalled
c
billion
billion
expansion
of
the
kinder

canada
trans
mountain
pipeline
the
project
has
pitted
ottawa
and
alberta
against
british
columbia
and
could
turn
into
a
constitutional
crisis
derail

kinder
morgan
said
earlier
this
month
it
was
halting
most
work
on
the
trans
mountain
expansion
project
which
was
approved
by
canada
in
but
has
been
beset
by
legal
tussles
the
expansion
of
the
pipeline
which
extends
from
alberta
to
the
coast
is
desperately
needed
by
alberta
which
wants
to
export
more
of
the
crude
it
produces
but
it
is
vehemently
opposed
by
which
has
pledged
new
environmental
rules
and
a
legal
challenge
putting
construction
at
risk
seeking
to
put
pressure
on
its
neighbor
alberta
introduced
legislation
on
monday
that
gives
it
the
power
to
control
what
products
flow
through
export
pipelines
allowing
it
to
prioritize
more
valuable
crude
oil
shipments
over
refined
fuels
like
gasoline
that
could
hurt
which
uses
alberta
s
refined
fuel
trans
mountain
is
the
only
pipeline
in
north
america
that
carries
both
crude
and
refined
fuel
products
we
did
not
start
this
fight
but
let
there
be
no
doubt
we
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
build
this
pipeline
alberta
premier
rachel
notley
told
reporters
environment
minister
george
heyman
said
in
response
that
his
government
was
prepared
to
defend
british
columbians
interests
with
every
legal
means
on
sunday
trudeau
pledged
financial
aid
and
said
his
government
would
draft
legislation
to
reaffirm
federal
jurisdiction
over
the
issue
those
measures
have
the
aim
of
making
sure
that
one
that
this
pipeline
will
be
built
and
two
that
all
of
the
investors
involved
know
that
we
take
this
seriously
and
they
can
be
confident
it
will
go
through

canada
s
shares

the

under
the
new
legislation
alberta
can
ask
companies
exporting
energy
products
to
seek
a
license
allowing
the
government
to
impose
restrictions
on
transport
by
pipeline
rail
and
truck
the
province
will
only
enforce
the
new
rules
if
deemed
necessary
and
any
move
may
be
tied
to
the
outcome
of
a
planned
may
decision
by
kinder
morgan
on
whether
construction
will
go
ahead
notley
said
aboriginal
and
municipal
leaders
held
a
news
conference
in
the
port
city
of
vancouver
to

their
opposition
to

they
say
poses
a
grave
environmental
