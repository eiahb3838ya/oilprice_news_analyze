royal
dutch
shell
defended
its
ambition
to
cut
carbon
emissions
on
monday
urging
investors
to
oppose
a
shareholder
resolution
arguing
that
the
oil
and
gas
giant
is
not
doing
enough
to
meet
international
targets
to
tackle
climate
change
the
company
like
many
of
its
peers
has
faced
growing
investor
pressure
to
address
the
need
to
reduce
fossil
fuel
burning
forcing
it
to
seek
a
delicate
balance
with
a
need
to
secure
growing
returns
from
its
traditional
business
last
november
shell
outlined
plans
to
halve
carbon
emissions
from
its
operations
and
sales
of
its
fuels
by
responding
to
investor
pressure
with
what
is
seen
as
one
of
the
most
ambitious
goals
in
the
sector

a

a
climate
activist
shareholder
group
put
forward
a
resolution
that
will
be
voted
on
at
shell
s
annual
general
meeting
next
month
urging
it
to
set
more
aggressive
targets
aligned
with
the
paris
climate
agreement
goal
of
limiting
global
warming
to
well
below
degrees
celsius
i
don
t
think
a
percent
reduction
of
emissions
footprint
in
meets
the
paris
climate
agreement
mark
van
baal
founder
of
follow
this
told
reuters
shell
uses
these
ambitions
to
do
business
as
usual
in
the
next
the
company
should
stop
exploring
for
new
oil
and
gas
resources
and
shift
to
renewable
energy
van
baal
said
last
year
s
resolution
by
follow
this
on
the
topic
won
the
support
of
percent
of
shareholders
but
the
debate
around
shell
s
climate
strategy
has
become
central
in
recent
years
shell
s
management
urged
shareholders
to
vote
against
the
resolution
at
the
agm
which
will
be
held
in
the
hague
on
may
we
share
the
objective
of
follow
this
for
shell
to
show
leadership
in
the
energy
transition
but
at
the
same
time
we
consider
the
resolution
unnecessary
given
that
we
have
already
outlined
an
approach
that
is
much
and
much
more
progressive
shell
chief
executive
officer
ben
van
beurden
told
reporters
in
a
phone
briefing
shell
will
have
to
initially
catch
up
with
society
s
carbon
reduction
goals
because
shell
s
current
emissions
are
higher
than
other
businesses
but
by
it
plans
to
be
in
line
with
the
global
targets
we
ll
be
aligned
with
society
s
progress
but
we
will
not
be
tied
to
an
approach
that
potentially
moves
too
quickly
or
too
slowly
to
this
transition
van
beurden
said
van
beurden
admitted
that
the
transition
could
have
a
very
significant
impact
on
shell
s
business
in
the
long
run
shell
plans
to
reduce
its
emissions
by
increasing
the
share
of
gas
and
biofuels
production
investing
in
renewable
energy
such
as
solar
and
offshore
wind
as
well
as
in
technologies
to
capture
carbon
and
van
beurden
said
shell
plans
to
invest
between
billion
per
year
on
its
energy
business
by
the
end
of
the
decade
less
than
a
tenth
of
its
planned
annual
spending
but
significantly
higher
than
its
rivals
