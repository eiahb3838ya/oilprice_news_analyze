saudi
arabia
hopes
opec
and
its
allies
will
be
able
to
relax
production
curbs
next
year
and
create
a
permanent
framework
to
stabilise
oil
markets
after
the
current
supply
cut
deal
ends
this
year
its
oil
minister
said
on
saturday
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
is
reducing
output
by
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
as
part
of
a
deal
with
russia
and
other
producers
the
pact
aimed
at
propping
oil
prices
began
in
january
and
will
run
until
the
end
of
saudi
arabian
oil
minister
khalid
said
opec
and
its
allies
were
committed
to
bringing
balance
and
stability
to
the
market
and
that
he
hoped
it
would
be
possible
to
ease
output
curbs
next
year
a
study
is
taking
place
and
once
we
know
exactly
what
balancing
the
market
will
entail
we
will
announce
what
is
the
next
step
the
next
step
may
be
easing
of
the
production
constraints
he
told
reporters
in
new
delhi
my
estimation
is
that
it
will
happen
sometime
in
but
we
don
t
know
when
and
we
don
t
know
how
falih
said
opec
was
determined
to
translate
the
success
of
the
deal
to
curb
supply
into
a
permanent
framework
with
other
major
producers
what
we
want
is
an
evergreen
framework
that
brings
producers
from
opec
and
countries
together
in
a
market
monitoring
fashion
that
allows
us
to
take
quick
decisions
he
said
i
think
everybody
has
learnt
producers
as
well
as
consumers
that
a
market
without
a
steering
wheel
is
very
destructive
very
damaging
to
the
interests
of
all
he
said
falih
said
compliance
with
the
output
cuts
in
january
was
oil
prices
have
doubled
from
their
lows
in
after
the
cuts
falih
said
the
market
had
absorbed
rising
shale
oil
production
as
output
from
countries
such
as
venezuela
and
mexico
had
declined
oil
inventories
fell
last
week
saudi
arabia
the
world
s
biggest
oil
exporter
in
march
cut
production
and
exported
less
than
million
bpd
due
to
seasonally
soft
demand
falih
said
that
in
saudi
arabia
s
oil
production
was
well
below
the
production
cap
with
exports
averaging
below
million
bpd
state
oil
company
saudi
aramco
has
signed
a
preliminary
deal
to
invest
in
india
s
planned
million
bpd
west
coast
refinery
falih
said
aramco
was
also
looking
at
buying
stakes
in
existing
major
refiners
and
expansion
projects
in
india
he
did
not
specify
the
size
of
stake
aramco
will
take
in
the
west
coast
refinery
but
added
the
more
the
india
aims
to
expand
its
refining
capacity
by
percent
to
about
million
bpd
by
falih
said
saudi
arabia
would
also
sign
oil
supply
deals
as
part
of
the
agreement
to
buy
stakes
in
indian
refineries
a
strategy
the
kingdom
has
adopted
to
expand
its
market
share
in
asia
and
fend
off
rivals
last
year
saudi
arabia
pledged
billions
of
dollars
of
investments
in
projects
in
indonesia
and
malaysia
to
secure
oil
supply
