reuters
germany
s
government
which
has
steadfastly
opposed
barring
diesel
cars
from
cities
is
working
on
changes
to
allow
driving
bans
on
certain
routes
on
an
emergency
basis
documents

showed
junior
transport
minister
norbert
barthle
a
conservative
disclosed
the
shift
in
a
reply
to
a
parliamentary
question
by
the
greens
party
first
reported
by
the
rheinische
post
the
plans
come
days
before
a
german
court
rules
on
whether
cities
can
implement
bans
which
carmakers
say
could
cut
the
resale
value
of
up
to
million
vehicles
in
europe
s
largest
car
market
forcing
manufacturers
to
pay
for
modifications
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
government
is
under
pressure
to
help
cities
whose
emissions
violate
european
union
standards
and
is
keen
to
find
ways
to
avoid
broad
bans
a
new
legal
basis
is
to
be
established
that
would
allow
driving
bans
or
restrictions
on
certain
limited
routes
to
protect
human
health
against
particulates
or
emissions

oxide
barthle
said
in
the
reply
that
would
make
possible
for
the
first
time
emergency
measures
to
protect
against
particulates
he
said
the
new
rules
could
be
finalised
by
the
end
of
the
year
merkel
has
stressed
the
need
to
find
solutions
quickly
for
the
affected
cities
and
said
she
wants
to
avoid
driving
bans
which
could
anger
drivers
by
focusing
on
switching
fleets
of
taxis
and
buses
to
electric
propulsion
germany
is
also
considering
plans
to
make
public
transport
free
in
cities
suffering
from
poor
air
quality
germany
s
highest
federal
administrative
court
is
due
to
rule
on
tuesday
on
an
appeal
brought
by
german
states
against
bans
imposed
by
local
courts
in
stuttgart
and
duesseldorf
over
bad
air
quality
there
has
been
a
global
backlash
against
cars
since
volkswagen
admitted
in
to
cheating
exhaust
tests
meant
to
limit
emissions
of
particulate
matter
and
nitrogen
oxide
nox
which
cause
respiratory
disease
while
other
countries
are
also
considering
restrictions
on
diesel
cars
bans
in
germany
would
be
a
big
blow
to
the
car
industry
and
an
embarrassment
for
merkel
s
government
which
has
long
backed
the
industry
which
employs
people
german
carmakers
have
invested
heavily
in
diesel
to
help
cut
carbon
dioxide
emissions
and
meet
climate
change
goals
but
the
vw
scandal
has
forced
manufacturers
to
increase
efforts
on
electric
cars
and
invest
in
making
diesel
engines
cleaner
oliver
luksic
transport
expert
for
germany
s
free
democrats
fdp
said
the
plans
were
a
disappropriation
for
millions
of
drivers
and
a
confession
from
the
government
that
they
had
failed
to
tackle
the
diesel
scandal
many
people
have
bought
diesel
cars
in
good
faith
now
their
vehicles
will
lose
value
and
won
t
be
used
in
many
big
cities
there
is
no
way
to
avoid
modifications
of
diesel
cars
at
the
expense
of
carmakers
