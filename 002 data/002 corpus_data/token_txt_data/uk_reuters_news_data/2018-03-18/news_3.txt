such

he
called
the

all

did
nothing
he
said
in
response
to
a
question
about
the
legal
move
those
who
are
putting

like
this
need
to
be
careful
that
doesn
t
become
encouraging
singaporean
prime
minister
lee
hsien
loong
said
it
was
a
complex
situation
which
asean
leaders
would
continue
to
discuss
frankly
it
s
an
issue
which
is
also
in
the
public
attention
and
it
s
one
of
those
where
intense
public
attention
sometimes
makes
it
more
difficult
to
solve

added
