canadian
authorities
late
on
wednesday
said
they
had
arrested
meng
also
the
daughter
of
huawei
s
founder
on
the
same
day
that
president
donald
trump
and
chinese
leader
xi
jinping
met
at
the
summit
in
argentina
the
world
s
two
economic
superpowers
had
agreed
on
a
trade
truce
period
to
hammer
out
a
more
permanent
agreement
which
sent
global
stock
markets
soaring
on
monday
equities
reversed
course
the
next
day
as
uncertainty
grew
that
the
and
china
could
in
fact
find
common
ground
in
general
we
all
have
the
same
questions
we
did
on
tuesday
said
art
hogan
chief
market
strategist
at
riley
fbr
in
new
york
the
news
on
huawei
throws
another
level
of
uncertainty
on
our
ability
to
actually
come
to
some
agreement
with
china
s
foreign
ministry
said
neither
canada
nor
the
united
states
had
clarified
the
reason
for
the
arrest
but
a
source
earlier
told
reuters
it
was
related
to
violations
of
sanctions
earlier
this
week
yields
rose
above
medium
yields
for
the
first
time
since
early
which
fanned
fears
about
a
recession
in
the
coming
months
and
also
sent
wall
street
shares
sliding
treasury
yields
tumbled
on
thursday
with
yields
hitting
lows
as
worries
about
trade
and
brexit
spurred
bids
additionally
traders
scaled
back
expectations
on
the
number
of
rate
hikes
the
federal
reserve
would
implement
amid
weakening
economic
data
and
market
volatility
jobs
data
is
due
on
friday
if
the
figures
show
any
serious
weakness
markets
are
likely
to
react
said
shuji
shirota
hsbc
s
head
of
macro
economic
strategy
the
dollar
weakened
against
major
peers
as
treasury
yields
slipped
and
traders
scaled
back
rate
hike
expectations
the
euro
was
percent
higher
against
the
dollar
at
also
pulling
down
equity
markets
were
oil
prices
oil
fell
more
than
percent
in
choppy
trading
after
opec
ended
a
key
meeting
having
made
no
decision
on
crude
output
as
it
prepared
to
debate
the
matter
with
other
exporters
the
next
day
an
opec
delegate
said
the
organisation
had
agreed
a
tentative
deal
to
cut
oil
output
but
had
not
yet
come
up
with
a
final
figure
crude
sank
percent
to
per
barrel
and
brent
was
last
at
down
percent
on
the
day
the
two
have
lost
percent
in
value
this
quarter
alone
but
this
week
s
opec
meeting
could
bring
more
surprises
the
real
impact
of
the
meeting
will
be
evident
on
friday
following
the
release
of
the
joint
declaration
