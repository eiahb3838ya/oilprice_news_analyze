nicole
barthelemy
the
quiet
gracious
owner
of
one
of
paris
s
premier
cheese
shops
on
the
rue
de
grenelle
told
me
this
week
with
real
panic
in
her
eyes
i
have
never
in
years
been
so
afraid
as
i
am
and
with
good
reason
only
a
few
blocks
away
on
the
rue
de
solferino
around
the
corner
from
the
musée
d
orsay
in
the
building
where
i
ve
lived
off
and
on
since
two
barricades
were
built
on
this
quiet
residential
street
one
was
set
ablaze
last
saturday
and
burned
for
hours
but
while
madame
barthelemy
and
i
may
need
to
dodge
scattered
clouds
of
tear
gas
launched
by
france
s
redoubtable
gendarmerie
president
emmanuel
macron
is
fighting
for
his
political
life
at
least
for
the
moment
his
vision
for
his
country
and
for
europe
seems
increasingly
disconnected
from
the
people
who
elected
him
tens
of
thousands
have
taken
the
streets
to
demonstrate
their
displeasure
and
that
s
what
is
stoking
fear
among
barthelemy
and
millions
more
it
s
not
hard
to
find
reasons
for
this
sudden
unraveling
of
the
grand
ambitions
of
the
youngest
french
leader
since
napoleon
macron
s
visions
for
this
future
appear
increasingly
disconnected
from
anything
france
even
europe
has
known
or
at
least
for
the
moment
even
wants
we
must
do
away
with
this
little
political
world
which
functions
only
for
itself
laurent
tinois
told
the
french
daily
le
monde
a
public
works
department
laborer
in
northern
france
he
is
a
local
leader
of
the
movement
known
as
the
for
their
yellow
vests
which
all
french
motorists
must
keep
in
their
cars
for
emergencies
the
and
the
hooligans
or
casseurs
breakers
who
have
ridden
along
like
pilot
fish
have
been
at
the
center
of
weeks
of
unrest
tinois
s
views
echo
those
of
hundreds
of
thousands
who
have
demonstrated
and
rioted
across
the
nation
the
revolution
of
the
yellow
vests
has
become
more
of
a
political
movement
for
utter
social
change
than
an
economic
issue
of
taxation
which
was
the
spark
that
set
off
this
firestorm
of
protest
so
on
tuesday
when
prime
minister
édouard
philippe
went
on
national
television
to
announce
a
suspension
of
a
gas
tax
increase
the
outrage
over
the
sop
of
halfway
measures
was
palpable
tinois
voted
in
the
last
election
for
macron
s
opponent
mélenchon
other
protesters
admitted
to
voting
for
a
range
of
macron
opponents
from
mélenchon
on
the
left
to
leader
marine
le
pen
all
have
taken
advantage
of
this
movement
to
press
their
disparate
desires
new
parliamentary
elections
even
macron
s
resignation
much
of
this
political
action
seems
designed
to
last
year
s
vote
that
swept
macron
and
his
new
political
party
into
office
with
a
landslide
and
what
appeared
to
be
an
unchallengeable
mandate
though
as
is
now
becoming
apparent
this
was
hardly
so
thousands
stayed
away
from
the
polls
because
they
saw
little
they
really
liked
and
now
they
seem
to
be
venting
their
anger
in
the
streets
as
someone
who
has
observed
how
french
presidents
back
to
charles
de
gaulle
dealt
with
the
protests
that
erupted
from
even
the
narrowest
change
in
direction
i
feel
macron
had
little
real
understanding
of
the
nation
he
was
seeking
to
transform
france
is
effectively
a
giant
ocean
liner
lumbering
straight
ahead
but
macron
arrived
in
the
pilot
house
and
immediately
tried
to
make
a
sudden
turn
in
direction
the
move
to
the
barricades
to
protest
taxes
and
inequalities
should
have
been
entirely
predictable
to
anyone
familiar
with
the
nation
s
history
while
barricades
date
to
the
century
in
france
the
french
revolution
in
was
the
first
time
such
a
show
of
resistance
led
to
the
beheading
of
a
french
king
louis
xvi
and
his
wife
marie
antoinette
the
barricades
went
up
again
in
times
of
turmoil
like
the
revolution
and
in
they
began
in
the
latin
quarter
with
a
student
rebellion
that
spread
quickly
to
workers
and
farmers
alike
before
de
gaulle
restored
order
by
threatening
to
resign
back
then
not
an
insignificant
threat
this
time
the
revolution
threatens
to
spread
again
in
the
wake
of
vast
rioting
and
pillaging
along
the
thousands
of
students
have
gone
out
on
strike
across
the
country
at
times
battling
police
as
they
protest
the
curriculum
changes
that
are
part
of
macron
s
education
reforms
in
front
of
the
national
assembly
in
paris
just
minutes
from
my
apartment
scores
of
ambulances
have
blocked
traffic
for
hours
sirens
blaring
hundreds
of
drivers
protesting
rules
that
discriminate
against
small
individual
ambulance
companies
in
favor
of
a
few
behemoths
faced
with
an
inchoate
and
leaderless
though
powerful
movement
and
having
moved
too
quickly
with
his
reforms
macron
s
easy
fix
of
suspending
the
gas
tax
increase
first
for
six
months
then
for
all
of
may
be
insufficient
he
s
also
dug
in
his
heels
on
upholding
his
repeal
of
the
surtax
on
the
wealthy
that
socialist
president
francois
mitterrand
initiated
three
decades
ago
we
will
never
unravel
anything
we
ve
done
over
the
past
months
macron
declared
to
a
session
of
his
cabinet
wednesday
evening
macron
s
reversal
of
this
tax
led
many
to
brand
him
president
of
the
of
course
macron
has
had
reasons
intellectually
quite
brilliant
for
each
of
his
fiscal
moves
the
gas
tax
was
designed
to
pay
for
a
france
ending
the
wealth
tax
was
designed
to
lure
british
bankers
driven
from
london
by
brexit
but
none
of
this
is
immediately
apparent
to
french
provincial
workers
many
of
whom
squeak
by
on
the
minimum
wage
of
around
euro
a
month
to
feed
their
families
and
buy
gas
to
get
to
work
in
a
countryside
with
little
public
transport
there
really
are
two
frances
rich
and
poor
but
especially
urban
and
rural
now
both
seem
to
be
united
in
their
revolt
and
fear
for
their
future
with
no
one
organized
to
negotiate
on
the
other
side
the
government
has
found
no
solution
beyond
putting
more
military
force
on
the
streets
for
what
promises
to
be
another
saturday
of
chaos
and
violence
but
france
s
president
faces
a
crisis
different
from
any
other
western
leader
macron
s
is
a
vast
peasant
uprising
that
requires
a
whole
new
set
of
nuanced
political
tools
if
he
is
to
neutralize
this
unrest
before
it
lurches
utterly
out
of
control
