texas and new mexico shale basins hold 49 years worth of oil -usgs

the
largest
oil
field
in
the
united
states
holds
as
much
as
years
worth
of
oil
at
current
production
rates
according
to
data
from
a
report
released
on
thursday
by
the
geological
survey
usgs
in
its
first
assessment
of
the
delaware
portion
of
the
permian
shale
field
that
spans
west
texas
and
new
mexico
the
usgs
which
is
part
of
the
department
of
the
interior
said
it
contains
about
billion
barrels
of
oil
and
trillion
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas
the
government
estimates
include
all
underground
shale
oil
and
gas
that
is
technically
recoverable
but
may
not
be
economic
to
extract
at
current
prices
the
estimate
is
twice
the
size
of
the
country
s
next
largest
shale
reserve
the
midland
basin
another
portion
of
the
permian
in
that
was
found
by
the
usgs
to
have
about
billion
barrels
of
oil
and
trillion
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas
survey
results
demonstrate
the
impact
that
improved
technologies
such
as
hydraulic
fracturing
and
directional
drilling
have
had
on
increasing
the
estimates
said
walter
guidroz
an
official
in
the
usgs
energy
resources
program
hydraulic
fracturing
forces
water
and
sand
underground
at
high
pressure
to
free
oil
and
gas
trapped
in
shale
rock
the
permian
basin
which
includes
both
shale
regions
is
expected
to
pump
million
barrels
of
crude
oil
per
day
this
month
up
percent
from
a
year
ago
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
the
delaware
and
midland
basins
combined
would
take
years
to
produce
if
all
the
oil
was
profitable
to
recovery

to
the
