stock
futures
tumbled
on
thursday
and
asian
markets
looked
set
to
follow
after
canadian
authorities
arrested
a
top
executive
of
chinese
tech
giant
huawei
technologies
fanning
fears
of
further
tensions
between
china
and
the
united
states
s
futures
fell
almost
percent
at
one
point
in
thin
asian
morning
trade
and
were
last
were
down
percent
the
canadian
justice
department
said
meng
wanzhou
deputy
chair
of
huawei
was
arrested
early
this
month
and
that
she
was
sought
for
extradition
by
the
united
states
the
arrest
heightened
the
sense
of
a
major
collision
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economic
powers
not
just
over
tariffs
but
also
over
technological
hegemony
it
also
came
as
an
inversion
in
the
yield
curve
has
stoked
global
investor
worries
of
a
possible
recession
australian
shares
were
down
percent
but
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
were
little
changed
ahead

opening
of
most
other
markets
in
the
region

pointed
to
a
fall
of
percent
in
japan
s
nikkei
currencies
were
steadier
with
major
currencies
little
changed
so
far
the
euro
traded
flat
at
while
the
dollar
dipped
percent
against
the
yen
to
the
yuan
is
also
unmoved
at
in
the
offshore
trade
treasuries
futures
were
also
almost
flat
the
benchmark
treasury
yield
fell
to
its
lowest
point
since
on
tuesday
while
the
yield
dropped
below
the
yield
causing
a
inversion
in
the
yield
curve
because
an
inverted
curve
has
often
tended
to
precede
a
recession
investors
were
spooked
by
that
markets
were
closed
on
wednesday
to
mark
the
death
of
former
president
george
bush
