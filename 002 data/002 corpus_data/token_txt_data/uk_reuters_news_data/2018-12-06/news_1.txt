shut
old

have
reduced
carbon

simply
by
doing
what

the
most
efficient
and
effective
way
to
serve
our
customers
johnson
said
noting
the
low
cost
of
gas
in
recent
years
has
made

more
economic
for

new
power
plant
than
refurbish
a
old
coal
unit
over
johnson
s
tenure
tva
s
generating

people
in
the
region
