off
the
famed
champs
elysees
boulevard
and
defaced
the
arc
de
triomphe
with
graffiti
directed
at
president
emmanuel
macron
seeking
to
regain
the
initiative
after
weeks
of
civil
unrest
the
government
appeared
ready
to
offer
concessions
philippe
told
the
senate
he
was
open
to
new
measures
to
help
the
workers
while
finance
minister
bruno
le
maire
said
he

that
he
wanted

i
am
ready

all
measures
that
will
help
raise
the
pay
of
those
on
the
minimum
wage
without
doing
excessive

the
rush
of

soothe
public
anger
began
with
philippe
s
on
fuel
tax
hikes
the
first
major
of
macron
s
presidency
yet
five
days
after
the
worst
rioting
central
paris
has
seen
since
all
signs
are
that
the
government
has
failed
to
quell
the
revolt
a
repeat
of
last
saturday
s
violence
in
paris
s
city
centre
would
deal
a
blow
to
the
economy
and
raise
doubts
over
the
government
s
survival
philippe
said
the
state
would
do
all
it

officials
in
areas
around
the
capital
were
also
asked
to
remove
anything
in
the
streets
that
could
be
used
as
projectiles
we
are
facing
people
who
are
not
here
to
protest
but
to
smash
and
we
want
to
have
the
means
to
not
give
them
a
free
rein
philippe
told
television
s
evening
news
programme
as
well
as
increased
police
numbers
twelve
armoured
vehicles
belonging
to
the
gendarmerie
would
be
used
the
first
time
in
a
french
city
since
when
riots
broke
out
in
the
capital
s
suburbs
there
is
concern
about
anarchist
and
groups
like
the
black
bloc
which
have
piggybacked
off
the
yellow
vest
movement
the
government
is
also
considering
using
troops
currently
deployed
on
patrols
to
protect
public
buildings
other
towns
across
the
country
including
bordeaux
ordered
measures

may
opt
to

rather
than
face

security
in
paris
on
facebook
and
across
social
media
protesters
called
for
act
iv
france
is
fed
up
we
will
be
there
in
bigger
numbers

for
french

on
read
one
group
s
banner
the
protests
named
after
the
fluorescent
safety
jackets
french
motorists
have
to
keep
in
their
cars
erupted
in
november
over
the
squeeze
on
household
budgets
caused
by
fuel
taxes
demonstrations
swiftly
grew
into
a
broad
rebellion
against
macron
with
no
formal
leader
their
demands
are
diverse
and
include
lower
taxes
higher
salaries
cheaper
energy
costs
better
retirement
provisions
and
even
macron
s
resignation
reversing
course
on
next
year
s
hikes
have
left
a
gaping
billion
euro
hole
in
the
government
s
budget
which
it
is
now
searching
for
ways
to
plug
citing
unnamed
sources
les
echos
business
daily
said
the
government
was
considering
delaying
corporate
tax
easing
planned
next
year
or
putting
off
an
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
the
unrest
has
exposed
the
resentment
among
dwellers
that
macron
whose
popularity
is
now
at
about
percent
is
with
the
middle
class
and
workers
they
see
the
former
investment
banker
as
closer
to
big
business
trouble
is
also
brewing
elsewhere
for
macron
teenage
students
on
thursday
blocked
access
to
more
than
high
schools
across
the
country
and
clashed
