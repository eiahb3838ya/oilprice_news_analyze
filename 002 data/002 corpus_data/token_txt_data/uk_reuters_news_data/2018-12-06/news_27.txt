no leader, lots of anger: can france's "yellow vests" become a political force?
yellow
vest
movement
caught
macron
off
guard
president
gave
in
to
its
demand
to
scrap
fuel
tax
rise
movement
unites
people
with
various
backgrounds
and
views
some
members
look
ahead
to
european
parliament
elections
by
michel

paris
dec
reuters
it
began
as
a
facebook
campaign
against
french
fuel
tax
increases
but
in
a
few
weeks
it
has
spiralled
into
a
movement
powerful
enough
to
force
emmanuel
macron
into
the
biggest
of
his
presidency
yet
the
movement
named
for
the
fluorescent
jackets
carried
by
french
motorists
remains
an
amorphous
group
with
a
rapidly
shifting
agenda
it
has
no
leader
it
named
eight
spokespeople
some
of
whom
disagreed
with
each
other
and
one
of
whom
was
promptly
sacked
members
are
broadly
opposed
to
authority
one
of
its
originators
a
accordionist
from
brittany
called
jacline
mouraud
who
also
works
in
hypnotherapy
and
makes
youtube
videos
received
death
threats
after
suggesting
the
movement
should
talk
to
the
government
anyone
who
has
a
gilet
jaune
and
most
people
in
france
suddenly
seem
to
can
put
it
on
and
become
part
of
the
movement
meaning
it
brings
together
people
of
hugely
different
ages
social
classes
occupations
and
views
this
is
its
strength
but
also
its
weakness
the
government
does
not
know
who
to
engage
with
even
though
the
movement
has
drawn
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
onto
the
streets
closing
roads
and
fuel
depots
and
spurring
riots
and
violence
in
the
capital
paris
on
successive
weekends
since
macron
gave
in
to
the
movement
s
main
demand
on
wednesday
by
scrapping
a
increase
set
for
january
the
yellow
vests
have
also
been
trying
to
agree
on
other
issues
to
fight
for
from
boosting
household
incomes
to
reinstating
a
wealth
tax
or
ousting
macron
he
betrayed
us
he
was
elected
promising
to
blow
out
political
parties
no
left
no
right
to
reconnect
political
power
with
the
people
christophe
chalen√ßon
a
blacksmith
from
provence
in
southern
france
who
has
become
one
of
the
more
recognisable
faces
of
the
movement
told
reuters
he
s
done
the
opposite
we
re
only
the
mirror
of
what
he
had
proposed
what
he
sold
to
us
we
need
a
new
representative
body
said
chalencon
who
has
been
criticised
for
postings
on
social
media
that
some
have
seen
as
in
an
age
of
a
populist
backlash
against
globalisation
in
the
western
world
the
yellow
vest
movement
shares
many
features
with
other
populist
forces
such
as
the
occupy
movement
in
the
united
states
and
italy
s
which
now
governs
an
opinion
poll
published
by
the
elabe
institute
on
wednesday
showed
that
in
the
presidential
election
in
may
many
in
the
movement
voted
for
candidates
on
the
or
although
many
also
didn
t
vote
they
mostly
have
a
diploma
or
a
lower
level
of
education
and
live
in
tight
financial
circumstances
often
in
rural
or
areas
where
depending
on
a
car
to
get
to
work
or
go
to
the
shops
is
essential
and
increasingly
costly
there
is
a
high
level
of
solidarity
among
volunteers
who
mount
roadblocks
share
food
and
post
pictures
together
online
polls
show
they
still
have
the
backing
of
about
percent
of
the
population
despite
the
violence
in
paris
which
the
government
blamed
on
extremist
groups
some
government
officials
play
down
the
prospects
of
such
a
diverse
movement
uniting
as
a
political
force
for
the
time
being
no
they
re
having
trouble
just
structuring
themselves
a
government
source
said
but
with
elections
to
the
european
parliament
coming
up
next
may
others
warn
against
complacency
especially
as
macron
was
taken
off
guard
by
the
protest
some
members
of
macron
s
team
say
privately
they
did
not
expect
the
planned
rise
in
fuel
prices
to
be
more
politically
explosive
than
other
reforms
macron
himself
rose
to
power
barely
a
year
after
creating
his
own
movement
en
marche
in
on
a
promise
to
be
neither
of
the
left
nor
the
right
and
to
introduce
a
new
style
of
politics
his
campaign
book
was
called
revolution
the
yellow
vests
do
not
have
the
same
education
or
work
background
as
macron
he
had
experience
in
government
as
a
former
economy
minister
yet
ironically
they
are
using
some
of
the
same
techniques
as
he
used
on
social
media
and
echoing
some
of
the
rhetoric
the
yellow
vests
are
a
political
movement
we
need
to
stop
feeling
sorry
for
them
bruno
bonnell
a
lawmaker
in
en
marche
on
the
move
and
an
early
follower
of
macron
said
in
three
weeks
it
s
transformed
itself
into
the
fiery
core
of
a
strong
populist
movement
he
said
it
reminds
me
of
the
start
of
en
marche
they
re
our
future
macron
enjoyed
high
ratings
at
the
start
of
his
presidency
and
managed
to
ram
through
changes
to
france
s
labour
code
but
his
brash
style
alienated
some
voters
and
changes
to
a
tax
to
reduce
the
burden
on
the
wealthy
earned
him
the
label
president
of
the
rich
his
ratings
now
hover
in
the
and
he
is
battling
to
keep
his
reform
agenda
on
track
his
biggest
threat
now
is
from
a
popular
national
uprising
that
while
not
associated
with
a
political
party
has
elements
that
sympathize
with
the
and
and
want
a
radical
the
sort
of
new
politics
president
donald
trump
and
his
former
strategist
steve
bannon
advocate
we
can
already
see
they
yellow
vests
have
huge
appeal
but
this
is
because
they
are
apolitical
and
can
genuinely
say
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
political
parties
said
charles
lichfield
europe
analyst
at
eurasia
group
risk
consultancy
for
the
gilets
jaunes
to
become
a
political
force
they
need
to
accept
the
notion
of
leadership
and
get
over
the
fact
that
their
chosen
leaders
will
need
to
balance
between
various
contradictory
france
a
nation
built
on
revolution
is
not
new
to
populist
uprisings
in
the
a
shopkeeper
called
pierre
poujade
spurred
protests
which
eventually
secured
seats
in
the
french
parliament
in
the
election
although
poujadism
as
it
became
known
eventually
faded
from
view
when
charles
de
gaulle
returned
to
power
it
left
a
lasting
legacy
the

of
its
deputies

of

national
front
one
of
the
yellow

andre
lannee
has
launched
facebook
pages
for
protesters
to
elect
two
representatives
per
region
another
bernaba
has
said
he
is
working
on
a
list
of
candidates
for
the
european
parliament
elections
in
which
french
voters
traditionally
back
more
populist
parties
asked
to
assess
the
yellow
vests
chances
of
contesting
the
european
parliament
elections
which
are
based
on
a
system
of
proportional
representation
lichfield
said
they
would
first
have
to
organise
quickly
and
find
a
charismatic
leader
they
will
understand
that
a
proportional
ballot
gives
them
their
best
chance
of
making
a
splash
