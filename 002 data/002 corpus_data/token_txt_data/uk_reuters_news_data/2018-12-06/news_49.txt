u.s. epa to roll back carbon rule on new coal plants
washington
dec
reuters
the
trump
administration
is
expected
on
thursday
to
roll
back
an
rule
that
requires
new
coal
plants
to
capture
their
carbon
emissions
a
move
that
could
crack
open
the
door
in
coming
years
for
new
plants
fired
by
the
fossil
fuel
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
will
make
an
energy
policy
announcement
at
est
gmt
on
thursday
andrew
wheeler
epa
s
acting
administrator
will
speak
alongside
harry
alford
president
of
the
national
black
chamber
of
commerce
a
opponent
of
former
president
barack
obama
s
limits
on
carbon
emissions
the
epa
is
expected
to
propose
allowing
new
coal
plants
to
emit
up
to
pounds
kg
of
carbon
dioxide
per
of
electricity
according
to
a
new
york
times
report
citing
unnamed
sources
the
trump
proposal
which
is
sure
to
be
challenged
by
lawsuits
from
environmental
groups
would
replace
an
standard
allowing
only
pounds
of
carbon
per
that
obama
rule
would
have
forced
new
plants
to
install
carbon
capture
equipment
that
is
not
yet
commercially
available
no
company
has
plans
to
build
a
new
coal
plant
due
to
competition
from
plentiful
and
natural
gas
that
could
change
as
president
donald
trump
rolls
back
rules
meant
to
curb
emissions
linked
to
global
warming
i
m
not
giving
up
on
building
a
new
generation
of
power
plants
in
this
country
said
myron
ebell
who
led
trump
s
epa
transition
team
last
year
ebell
said
trump
s
policies
could
allow
new
coal
plants
to
be
build
in
the
next
five
or
years
the
administration
says
coal
plants
can
be
made
to
burn
coal
far
more
efficiently
but
high
costs
have
made
them
uneconomic
the
regulatory
roll
back
comes
ahead
of
the
annual
climate
talks
in
poland
next
week
where
white
house
officials
plan
a
panel
on
coal
technology
it
was
unclear
whether
the
proposal
can
withstand
lawsuits
jay
duffy
a
legal
associate
at
clean
air
task
force
said
the
weaker
carbon
emissions
level
would
not
satisfy
federal
clean
air
law
requirements
for
the
best
available
emissions
technology
while
the
carbon
capture
equipment
the
obama
rule
would
have
required
is
technologically
feasible
it
is
expensive
but
duffy
said
obama
s
rule
would
drive
down
costs
if
trump
is
really
interested
in
supporting
coal
miners
what
he
should
be
looking
at
is
supporting
and
advancing
carbon
capture
said
duffy
that
s
the
only
way
coal
survives
in
a
future
where
rules
on
carbon
constraints
are
likely
he
