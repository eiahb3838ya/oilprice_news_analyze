nordea
bank
aims
to
increase
shipping
finance
activities
to
the
growing
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
industry
executives
at
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
shipping
financiers
said
china
s
crackdown
on
pollution
and
its
growing
demand
for
more
environmentally
friendly
sources
of
power
such
as
lng
are
boosting
demand
for
ships
to
transport
the
fuel
we
would
like
to
expand
the
portfolio
and
there
are
certain
segments
that
we
would
like
to
expand
in
one
of
them
is
on
the
lng
side

nordea
s
head
of
shipping
for
the
nordic
region
told
reuters
we
see
there
is
an
underlying
strong
demand
over
time
and
we
see
that
going
forward
as
well
he
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
nordic
bank
s
investor
event
in
london
this
week
lng
shipping
officials
at
the
event
expected
strong
markets
for
the
next
two
years
but
they
said
that
with
to
lng
ships
on
order
a
further
build
up
of
vessels
through
new
ordering
could
undermine
business
prospects
nordea
s
shipping
and
offshore
portfolio
stands
at
billion
euros
billion
with
lng
lending
accounting
for
about
percent
which
includes
the
financing
of
specialist
floating
storage
and
regassification
vessels
nordea
officials
said
bech
nordea
s
head
of
international
shipping
and
offshore
said
the
bank
also
wanted
to
boost
lending
to
the
dry
bulk
and
tanker
industries
we
expect
that
and
will
be
decent
years
in
dry
bulk
and
potentially
a
surprise
on
the
upside
as
we
have
seen
now
on
tankers
he
told
reuters
slowing
orders
for
dry
bulk
vessels
and
tankers
have
helped
boost
prospects
after
years
of
tough
conditions
german
banks
were
once
the
top
global
shipping
financiers
but
they
have
been
exiting
the
market
or
are
trying
to
sell
billions
of
euros
in
loans
much
of
them
bech
said
nordea
did
not
want
to
buy
portfolios
from
other
banks
