it
s
not
shaping
up
as
a
merry
christmas
for
coal
exporters
to
asia
as
the
region
s
top
buyers
china
and
india
pull
back
from
the
recent
trend
of
strong
imports
the
chinese
authorities
appear
to
be
making
good
on
a
commitment
to
try
and
limit
the
country
s
imports
of
the
polluting
fuel
to
levels
the
same
as
the
restrictions
have
led
to
a
sharp
drop
in
the
daily
import
of
coal
so
far
in
december
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
refinitiv
seaborne
imports
in
the
first
five
days
of
the
month
stood
at
million
tonnes
or
a
daily
rate
of
just
tonnes
this
compares
to
total
seaborne
imports
of
million
tonnes
in
the
first
months
of
a
daily
rate
of
about
tonnes
the
authorities
in
beijing
have
told
coal
traders
and
utilities
they
want
imports
for
the
whole
year
to
be
similar
to
the
million
tonnes
in
this
is
likely
going
to
be
a
challenge
since
customs
data
showed
imports
for
the
first
months
of
the
year
were
million
tonnes
up
percent
from
the
same
period
in
with
data
pointing
to
november
seaborne
imports
of
about
million
tonnes
this
would
in
theory
leave
only
about
million
tonnes
available
for
december
at
the
rate
of
imports
for
the
first
five
days
of
december
this
may
just
be
possible
as
it
suggests
about
million
tonnes
for
the
month
as
a
whole
however
the
data
doesn
t
cover
overland
imports
mainly
from
neighbouring
mongolia
meaning
it
s
likely
that
imports
will
probably
exceed
those
of
but
the
sharp
reduction
in
imports
so
far
in
december
shows
beijing
s
message
to
the
industry
is
being
heeded
india
the
coal
importer
behind
china
also
appears
to
be
cutting
back
in
december
with
a
mere
tonnes
discharged
in
the
first
five
days
a
paltry
daily
rate
of
tonnes
the
daily
rate
of
imports
for
the
first
months
of
the
year
was
tonnes
according
to
the
refinitiv
data
the
lower
imports
so
far
in
december
are
at
odds
with
recent
developments
in
india
as
utilities
and
steel
makers
have
resorted
to
buying
more
from
overseas
to
overcome
domestic
transport
bottlenecks
it
s
possible
that
india
s
december
imports
will
be
boosted
by
arrivals
from
indonesia
given
that
it
takes
about
two
weeks
to
sail
from
the
region
of
kalimantan
to
india
s
west
coast
indeed
the
data
shows
million
tonnes
of
coal
is
likely
to
be
imported
by
india
in
december
a
figure
certain
to
increase
as
more
cargoes
from
indonesia
are
fixed
however
even
if
the
number
does
rise
in
coming
days
it
s
likely
december
will
be
below
the
million
tonnes
imported
in
november
and
the
million
in
october
the
weaker
imports
by
both
china
and
india
are
being
reflected
in
coal
prices
in
australia
and
indonesia

if
there

for

it

that

for
