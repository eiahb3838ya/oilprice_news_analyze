global
stock
markets
slumped
for
a
third
day
running
on
thursday
as
the
arrest
of
a
top
executive
of
chinese
tech
giant
huawei
in
canada
for
extradition
to
the
united
states
fed
fears
of
fresh
tensions
between
the
two
economic
superpowers
the
arrest
of
huawei
s
chief
financial
officer
meng
wanzhouof
who
is
also
the
daughter
of
the
firm
s
founder
triggered
renewed
fireworks
coming
just
as
washington
and
beijing
prepare
for
crucial
trade
negotiations
asian
markets
took
a
beating
huawei
is
not
listed
but
china
s
telecom
equipment
maker
zte
corp
sank
percent
in
hong
kong
while
most
of
the
nearby
national
bourses
lost
at
least
percent
europe
slumped
too
in
early
trading
as
percent
falls
for
the
tech
sector
miners
and
also
carmakers
kicked
london
frankfurt
and
paris
to
lows
we
had
this
very
ugly
new
turn
and
just
the
degree
to
which
the
market
has
reacted
just
suggests
to
me
that
they
are
vulnerable
right
now
said
saxo
bank
s
head
of
fx
strategy
john
hardy
it
think
we
should
all
be
very
careful
it
is
not
looking
good
especially
if
the
s
p
goes
to
new
hardy
said
that
president
donald
trump
may
try
to
send
some
reassuring
tweets
later
for
the
time
being
though
s
p
futures
were
down
almost
percent
the
losses
might
have
been
even
steeper
had
cme
group
s
chicago
mercantile
exchange
not
implemented
a
series
of
trading
halts
in
asia
that
had
limited
the
initial
drop
japan
s
nikkei
shed
percent
closing
at
its
lowest
level
since
with
related
shares
leading
the
losses
huawei
is
one
of
the
world
s
largest
makers
of
smartphones
and
telecommunications
network
equipment
msci
s
index
lost
percent
too
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
dropped
percent
while
chinese
bluechips
lost
percent
to
take
their
slump
to
percent
saxo
bank
s
hardy
highlighted
that
the
australian
dollar
which
is
highly
sensitive
to
trade
tensions
due
to
huge
aussie
metals
sales
to
china
had
failed
to
lift
after
some
reassuring
comments
from
beijing
on
the
trade
discussions
it
shed
percent
against
the
dollar
to
the
greenback
itself
fell
as
much
percent
against
the
yen
to
yen
as
it
suffered
slightly
too
the
yuan
eased
percent
to
per
dollar
in
offshore
trade
the
euro
barely
budged
at
and
the
canadian
dollar
languished
near
the
low
it
had
hit
the
previous
day
after
cautious
noises
from
the
bank
of
canada
on
the
huawei
drama
canadian
authorities
had
said
they
had
arrested
the
firm
s
cfo
in
vancouver
china
s
foreign
ministry
said
neither
canada
and
the
united
states
had
clarified
their
reason
for
the
move
but
a
source
had
earlier
told
reuters
it
was
related
to
violations
of
sanctions
on
iran
the
arrest
heightened
the
sense
of
a
major
collision
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economic
powers
not
just
over
tariffs
but
also
over
technological
hegemony
britain
s
bt
group
said
it
was
removing
huawei
s
equipment
from
the
core
of
its
existing
and
mobile
operations
australia
and
new
zealand
have
also
rejected
huawei
s
products
the
has
been
telling
its
allies
not
to
use
huawei
products
for
security
reasons
and
is
likely
to
continue
to
put
pressure
on
its
allies
said
norihiro
fujito
chief
investment
strategist
at
mitsubishi
ufj
morgan
stanley
securities
so
while
there
was
a
brief
moment
of
optimism
after
the
weekend
talks
but
the
reality
is
it
won
t
be
that
easy
he
said
traders
were
also
waiting
to
hear
from
vienna
about
what
kind
of
cuts
opec
and
other
oil
producers
like
russia
could
make
to
their
output
consensus
among
analysts
is
for
somewhere
between
million
barrels
per
day
and
brent
dived
back
below
a
barrel
as
saudi
arabia
s
energy
minister
said
going
into
the
day
long
meeting
that
million
would
be
enough
yields
on
german
government
bonds
held
near
lows
in
risk
off
environment
while
those
on
benchmark
treasuries
were
near
a
low
at
percent
adding
to
worries
about
recession
risks
the
treasury
yield
curve
remained
inverted
between
and
zones
with
notes
yielding
percent
below
percent
on

jobs
data
is
due
on
friday
if
the
figures
show
any
sign
of
serious

react
