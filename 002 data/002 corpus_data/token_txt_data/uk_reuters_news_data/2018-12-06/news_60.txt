the
french
government
is
considering
lowering
taxes
on
electricity
in
order
to
stabilise
household
power
bills
two
sources
familiar
with
the
situation
told
reuters
on
thursday
the
government
had
said
this
week
that
it
would
prevent
utility
edf
s
regulated
power
prices
from
rising
this
winter
but
the
firm
s
competitors
immediately
said
they
would
challenge
that
decision
in
court
earlier
government
attempts
at
freezing
prices
have
been
overruled
household
power
prices
are
set
by
independent
energy
regulator
cre
in
a
complex
formula
that
includes
the
price
of
power
generation
transport
and
distribution
a
third
part
of
the
retail
price
is
made
up
of
taxes
what
is
being
discussed
is
that
the
share
of
taxes
in
the
power
price
could
be
reduced
in
order
to
compensate
for
an
increase
in
the
generation
cost
which
on
balance
would
keep
prices
stable
