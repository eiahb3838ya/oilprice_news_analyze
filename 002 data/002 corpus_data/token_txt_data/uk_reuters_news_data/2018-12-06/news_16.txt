analysis-oil's sharp price drop fuels questions for stock market
new
york
reuters
stock
investors
are
wary
that
a
percent
slump
in
oil
prices
will
pressure
corporate
profits
while
also
presenting
a
sign
of
weakness
in
global
growth
at
a
time
they
are
already
weighing
when
the
long
economic
expansion
will
end
oil
prices
fell
further
on
thursday
as
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
met
in
vienna
opec
and
allied
exporting
countries
ended
the
meeting
without
announcing
a
decision
to
cut
crude
output
and
prepared
to
debate
the
matter
the
next
day
oil
drop
holds
economic
benefits
including
lower
costs
for
some
companies
and
cheaper
fuel
prices
for
consumers
but
investors
were
already
bracing
for
a
significant
drop
in
profit
growth
next
year
and
the
oil
price
slump
is
poised
to
bite
into
profits
for
energy
producers
and
related
companies
that
are
part
of
wall
street
benchmark
s
p
stock
index
opec
and
allied
producers
used
output
cuts
to
curb
an
oil
glut
that
sent
prices
from
late
into
a
prolonged
slump
bringing
prices
to
below
a
barrel
at
the
start
of
but
supplies
are
growing
again
and
the
trade
war
and
other
factors
have
investors
worried
that
slowing
economic
growth
could
erase
demand
and
send
prices
still
lower
what
started
the
on
oil
was
a
supply
issue
said
alicia
levine
chief
market
strategist
at
bny
mellon
investment
management
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
what
we
are
getting
is
fears
of
slowing
demand
and
fears
of
slowing
demand
are
directly
related
to
fears
of
global
growth
crude
oil
prices
have
fallen
percent
or
more
times
since
according
to
ed
clissold
chief
strategist
at
ned
davis
research
of
the
prior
occurrences
the
oil
drop
overlapped
eight
times
with
what
ned
davis
research
defines
as
a
cyclical
bear
market
a
percent
drop
in
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
after
calendar
days
or
a
percent
decline
after
calendar
days
however
finds
clissold
in
only
three
of
those
cases
did
the
oil
decline
overlap
with
a
economic
recession
futures
contracts
for
crude
known
as
west
texas
intermediate
wti
topped
a
barrel
in
early
october
the
commodity
slid
to
as
low
as
last
week
and
was
trading
just
above
on
thursday
brent
the
global
crude
benchmark
has
notched
a
similar
percentage
drop
somewhere
in
the
level
it
s
probably
a
good
level
for
the
market
because
producers
are
making
enough
money
and
it
s
also
helping
the
consumer
said
keith
lerner
chief
market
strategist
at
suntrust
advisory
services
in
atlanta
but
if
you
see
an
abrupt
move
down
the
bigger
concern
is
what
is
that
signalling
about
the
global
oil
decline
has
coincided
with
increased
turbulence
in
the
stock
market
the
benchmark
s
p
late
last
month
confirmed
a
correction
a
decline
of
more
than
percent
from
its
high
still
investor
optimism
about
a
less
aggressive
path
of
hikes
prompted
a
modest
market
rebound
both
oil
and
equities
markets
have
been
focused
on
international
trade
china
s
economic
health
and
the
global
economy
said
david
katz
chief
investment
officer
at
matrix
asset
advisors
in
new
york
for
the
near
term
the
two
are
very
closely
correlated
katz
said
since
oil
s
october
peak
the
s
p
energy
sector
has
dropped
about
percent
twice
the
drop
for
the
overall
s
p
analysts
have
been
lowering
earnings
estimates
for
the
sector
with
s
p
energy
companies
now
expected
to
increase
earnings
by
percent
in
down
from
an
expectation
of
percent
on
oct
according
to
ibes
data
from
refinitiv
many
investors
see
positives
in
the
oil
drop
including
a
potential
stimulus
for
consumer
spending
through
lower
gasoline
prices
lower
fuel
prices
could
help
check
inflation
allowing
the
federal
reserve
to
slow
its
program
of
interest
rate
hikes
but
david
bianco
americas
chief
investment
officer
for
dws
estimates
that
every
per
barrel
decline
in
oil
prices
shaves
to
per
share
from
s
p
earnings
the
s
p
is
expected
to
earn
per
share
this
year
according
to
ibes
data
from
refinitiv
that
earnings
impact
includes
not
just
energy
companies
but
also
industrial
manufacturers
that
service
the
energy
sector
it
also
accounts
for
any
earnings
boost
for
companies
like
airlines
and
consumer
companies
that
benefit
from
lower
fuel
prices
the
s
p
is
much
more
of
a
commodity
producer
than
a
commodity
user
bianco
said
higher
commodity
prices
bring
higher
profits
and
lower
commodity
prices
bring
lower
profits
this
is
one
of
the
most
reliable
relationships
when
it
comes
to
corporate
profitability
of
them
