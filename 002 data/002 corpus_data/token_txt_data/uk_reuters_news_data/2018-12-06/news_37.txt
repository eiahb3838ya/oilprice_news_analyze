dubai
reuters
the
united
arab
emirates
said
on
thursday
the
gulf
cooperation
council
remained
valid
despite
a
bitter
row
with
qatar
that
has
fractured
the
bloc
ahead
of
an
annual
summit
next
week
saudi
arabia
the
uae
bahrain
and
member
egypt
have
imposed
a
diplomatic
and
economic
boycott
on
qatar
since
june
over
allegations
doha
supports
terrorism
qatar
denies
the
charges
and
says
the
boycott
aims
to
curtail
its
sovereignty
the
main
success
of
the
council
is
in
its
economic
aspects
and
the
creation
of
a
gulf
common
market
uae
minister
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
anwar
gargash
tweeted
the
political
crisis
will
end
when
the
cause
behind
it
ends
and
that
is
qatar
s
support
of
extremism
and
its
interference
in
the
stability
of
the
the
dispute
has
undermined
the
regional
role
of
the
gcc
set
up
in
as
a
bulwark
against
larger
neighbors
iran
and
iraq
last
week
qatar
abruptly
announced
it
was
quitting
opec
after
years
to
focus
on
gas
in
an
apparent
swipe
at
the
bloc
s
de
facto
leader
saudi
arabia
the
move
has
deepened
the
sense
among
diplomats
and
analysts
that
any
prospect
for
a
resolution
to
the
dispute
was
unlikely
to
come
at
the
gcc
summit
in
riyadh
saudi
arabia
s
king
has
invited
qatar
s
emir
to
attend
the
gathering
of
heads
of
state
but
doha
has
not
yet
said
what
level
of
representation
it
would
send
bahrain
s
foreign
minister
said
in
remarks
published
on
thursday
that
the
level
of
qatari
representation
at
the
summit
was
irrelevant
it
is
the
same
whether
they
attend
or
not
foreign
minister
khalid
bin
ahmed
al
khalifa
told
the
pan
arab
daily
asharq
the
crisis
with
qatar
has
reached
unprecedented
levels
and
i
don
t
know
how
they
will
come
back
from
that
as
qatar
has
joined
itself
with
the
region
s
enemies
such
as
iran
and
distanced
itself
from
the
qatar
s
ruler
last
month
said
the
dispute
exposed
the
failure
of
the
gcc
and
harmed
regional
security
by
weakening
the
block
which
groups
bahrain
kuwait
oman
qatar
saudi
arabia
and
the
uae
at
last
year
s
summit
held
in
kuwait
saudi
