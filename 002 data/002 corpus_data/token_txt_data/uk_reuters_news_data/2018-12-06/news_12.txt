the

s
two
economic

soaring
on

the

something

pricing
in
said
art
hogan
chief

strategist
at
riley
fbr
in
new
york
earlier
this
week
yields
rose
above
yields
for
the
first
time
since

fears
about
a
recession
in
the
coming
months
and
also
sent
wall
street
shares
sliding
treasury
yields
pared
some
of
the
decline
as
wall
street
trimmed
losses
after
flailing
early
in
the
day
with
yields
hitting
lows
as
worries
about
trade
and
brexit
spurred
bids
additionally
traders
scaled
back
expectations
on
the
number
of
rate
hikes
the
federal
reserve
would
implement
amid
weakening
economic
data
and
market
volatility
jobs
data
is
due
on
friday
if
the

show
any
serious
weakness

to
react

shirota
hsbc

head
of

expectations
the

was
percent
higher
against
the
dollar
at
gold
prices
which
move
inversely
with
the
dollar
held
near
a
peak
as
the
greenback
and
equities
slipped
oil
prices
fell
about
percent
in
choppy
trading
after
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
ended
a
meeting
without
making
a
decision
on
crude
output
opec
met
in
vienna
