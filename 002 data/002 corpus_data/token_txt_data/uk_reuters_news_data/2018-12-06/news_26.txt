johannesburg
reuters
south
africa
s
government
is
discussing
restructuring
the
debt
of
utility
eskom
but
will
only
give
details
of
what
it
plans
to
do
next
year
public
enterprises
minister
pravin
gordhan
said
on
thursday
in
comments
which
sent
eskom
s
bonds
tumbling
the
power
firm
said
this
week
that
it
wanted
the
government
to
take
on
billion
rand
billion
of
its
debts
about
a
quarter
of
its
total
borrowings
of
billion
rand
it
is
also
eyeing
a
steep
hike
in
tariffs
in
from
the
energy
regulator
that
brings
me
to
the
last
question
about
debt
restructuring
that
s
an
issue
that
is
being
discussed
in
government
and
some
time
in
the
new
year
government
as
a
whole
will
give
you
some
idea
of
where
we
are
going
gordhan
told
a
news
conference
it
s
work
in
progress
we
re
dealing
with
billion
rand
of
debt
and
its
not
something
you
can
deal
with
there
is
no
possibility
of
haircuts
gordhan
added
declining
to
elaborate
on
which
eskom
debt
instruments
could
be
restructured
or
the
maturities
of
those
instruments
eskom
s
bonds
fell
sharply
in
response
to
the
talk
of
restructuring
with
its
bond
sliding
as
much
as
cents
to
an
low
the
rand
also
slipped
adding
to
earlier
losses
to
fall
percent
to
session
low
of
per
dollar
the
idea
of
moving
eskom
s
debt
on
to
government
s
balance
sheet
has
unnerved
investors
as
it
puts
even
more
pressure
on
south
africa
s
sovereign
credit
ratings
already
rated
in
grade
by
two
of
the
top
three
agencies
eskom
poses
a
huge
risk
to
the
economy
and
the
credit
rating
said
independent
energy
analyst
mike
levington
moving
billion
rand
of
the
debt
isn
t
going
to
solve
its
systemic
problems
it
s
ability
to
raise
capital
is
fast
diminishing
levington
said
africa
s
most
industrialized
economy
has
experienced
a
week
of
nationwide
power
outages
which
eskom
has
blamed
on
low
coal
supplies
as
well
as
maintenance
of
its
ageing
fleet
of
power
stations
that
has
taken
the
shine
off
data
showing
the
economy
had
emerged
from
recession
president
cyril
ramaphosa
is
at
pains
to
economic
growth
by
luring
foreign
investment
ahead
of
national
elections
expected
in
may
next
year
but
the
south
african
economy
is
set
to
grow
well
below
percent
in
growth
could
be
dragged
lower
next
year
if
power
outages
persist
