finance
minister
arun
jaitley
said
the
government
did
not
disclose
the
price
of
the
percent
stake
but
based
on
rec
s
closing
share
price
on
thursday
it
would
be
worth
around
billion
rupees
billion
the
sale
may
allow
the
government
to
say
that
it
is
getting
closer
to
meeting
its
target
of
raising
billion
rupees
through
the
sale
of
government
stakes
in
various
entities
in
the
year
ending

have

jaitley
told
a
news
conference
adding
that
a
ministerial
panel
will
work
out
the
pricing
and
other
aspects
of
the

jaitley
had
previously
announced
that
the
government
would
support
mergers
and
acquisitions
in
cases
where
companies
operated
in
the
same
area
before
the
announcement
which
followed
a
cabinet
meeting
the
government
had
raised
billion
rupees
from
the
sale
of
government
stakes
during
the
current
fiscal
year
according
to
an
official
website
if
it
falls
short
of
the
target
the
government
could
struggle
to
meet
its
goal
of
bringing
the
fiscal
deficit
down
to
percent
of
gdp
in
this
fiscal
year
however
because
the
sale
involves
two
entities
critics
of
the
government
s
privatisation
programme
say
that
any
gains
the
administration
of
prime
minister
narendara
modi
seeks
to
book
are
not
credible
as
the
money
would
merely
have
gone
from
one
pocket
to
another
the
acquisition
is
driven
by
the
government
s
intent
to
meet
its
disinvest
target
instead
of
a
sovereign
money
it
is
a
money
it
is
just
creating
a
book
entry
said
stock
market
expert
ajay
bagga
the
government
owns
percent
of
pfc
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
the
government
has
sold
a
asset
to
another
government
entity
and
sought
to
count
the
proceeds
towards
its
target
in
the
previous
fiscal
year
the
government
sold
its
percent
stake
in
hindustan
petroleum
corp
to
explorer
oil
and
natural
gas
india
s
fiscal
deficit
was
percent
of
the
target
indicating
that
the
government
which
faces
a
general
election
by
may
next
year
must
boost
its
tax
and
revenue
to
fund
various
welfare
