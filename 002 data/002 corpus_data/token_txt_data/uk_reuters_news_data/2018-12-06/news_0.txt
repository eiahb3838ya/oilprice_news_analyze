reuters
the
united
states
may
soon
get
funding
for
a
new
heavy
icebreaker
ship
the
head
of
the
coast
guard
said
on
thursday
as
global
warming
spurs
the
race
to
stake
out
the
arctic
which
is
rich
in
oil
gas
and
minerals
the
united
states
has
two
operational
icebreakers
a
heavy
one
the
polar
star
which
is
more
than
years
old
and
has
outlived
its
life
expectancy
by
a
dozen
years
and
a
medium
one
the
healy
cutter
by
comparison
russia
has
about
to
icebreakers
vessels
that
can
rescue
other
ships
supply
bases
and
reach
oil
spills
in
harsh
polar
conditions
i
m
guardedly
optimistic
funding
for
that
first
polar
security
cutter
is
going
to
be
there
commandant
karl
schultz
said
at
a
national
press
club
event
icebreakers
support
scientific
missions
and
operate
in
the
arctic
and
antarctic
which
hold
vast
natural
gas
oil
mineral
fish
and
fresh
water
resources
schultz
said
while
washington
participates
in
several
forums
on
arctic
security
and
cooperation
such
as
the
arctic
council
it
also
needs
to
ensure
it
has
the
necessary
equipment
he
said
china
early
this
year
declared
itself
a
near
arctic
state
outlined
how
it
believed
the
region
should
be
developed
and
is
expanding
its
icebreaker
fleet
diplomacy
and
cooperation
are
really
hollow
or
shallow
without
presence
schultz
said
adding
that
the
country
needs
a
minimum
of
six
icebreakers
which
can
cost
about
billion
each
and
take
up
to
years
to
build
if
we
re
not
present
if
we
don
t
own
the
environment
today
guess
who
owns
it
tomorrow
our
while
president
donald
trump
s
administration
has
budgeted
million
for
an
icebreaker
it
is
not
certain
whether
the
funding
will
survive
in
congress
which
is
also
looking
for
ways
to
fund
the
border
wall
with
mexico
among
other
items
the
coast
guard
is
part
of
homeland
security
one
of
several
departments
that
have
not
been
funded
for
the
budget
congress
is
expected
to
consider
a
billion
bill
before
stopgap
funding
expires
on
to
fund
the
agencies
through
the
fiscal
year
that
ends
next
