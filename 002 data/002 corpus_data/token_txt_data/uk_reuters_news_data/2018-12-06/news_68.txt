arrested
huawei
s
global
chief
financial
officer
in
vancouver
where
she
is
facing
extradition
to
the

states
the
arrest
is
related
to
violations
of
sanctions
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
said
though
officials
have
so
far
stayed
mum
on
her
allegations
the
arrest
heightened
the
sense
of
a
major
collision
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economic
powers
not
just
over
tariffs
but
also
over
technological
hegemony

from

core
of
its

australia

also
rejected

the
has
been
telling
its
allies
not
to
use
huawei
products
for
security
reasons
and
is
likely
to
continue
to
put
pressure
on
its
allies
said
norihiro
fujito
chief

strategist
at

morgan
stanley
securities
so
while
there
was
a
brief
moment
of
optimism
after
the
weekend
talks
but
the
reality
is
it
won
t
be
that
easy
he
said

of
china
s
telecom
equipment
maker
zte
corp
sank
percent
in
hong
kong
and

in
shenzhen
zte

markets
had
initially
brightened
this
week
after
and
chinese
leaders
agreed
a
temporary
trade
truce
at
a
meeting
on
saturday
but
the
mood
quickly
soured
on
scepticism
that
the
two
sides
can
reach
a
substantive
deal
on
a
host
of
hugely
divisive
issues

tight

closed
on
wednesday
to
mark
the
death
of
former

george
bush
adding
to
worries
about
recession
risks
the
yield
curve
remained
inverted
between
and
zones
with
notes
yielding
percent
below
percent
on
notes
if
the
upcoming
jobs
data
on
friday
shows
some
weakness
markets
will
face
a
major
challenge
said
shuji
shirota
head
of
macro
economic
strategy
at
hsbc
the
yield
inversion
is
a
symptom
of
a
weak
economy
said
bryan
whalen
group
managing
director
of
tcw
in
los
angeles
noting
the
economy
has
not
been
able
to
achieve
sustainable
economic
growth
of
more
than
percent
in
recent
years
if
the
couldn
t
break
the
percent
growth
environment
with
interest
rates
and
a
rapidly
expanding
balance
sheet
early
in
the
economic
cycle
why
would
you
ever
think
we
could
do
it
when
interest
rates
are
rising
and
balance
sheet
is
shrinking
and
we
are
basically
years
into
an
aging
economic
cycle
he
said
it
s
hard
to
envision
a
scenario
where
growth
doesn
t
dip
down
if
not
kind

going

a
oil
prices
fell
ahead
of
a
meeting
by
producer
group
opec
that
is
expected
to
result
in
a
supply
cut
aimed
at
draining
a
glut
that
has
pulled
down
crude
prices
by
percent
since
october
a
monitoring
committee
of
opec
and
its
allies
including
russia
agreed
on
the
need
to
cut
oil
output
in
two
sources
familiar
with
the
discussions
said
still
lack
of
details
could
suggest
such
an
agreement
could
be
elusive
