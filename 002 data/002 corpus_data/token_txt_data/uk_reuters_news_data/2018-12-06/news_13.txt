update 4-in major shift, u.s. now exports more oil than it ships in
reuters
the
united
states
last
week
exported
more
crude
oil
and
fuel
than
it
imported
for
the
first
time
on
record
according
to
data
released
on
thursday
the
same
day
opec
ended
a
meeting
without
a
decision
to
curb
global
output
to
balance
out
the
historic
surge
in
supply
when
adding
in
all
imports
and
exports
of
crude
and
refined
products
the
exported
a
net
barrels
per
day
for
the
week
through
the
first
time
that
has
happened
according
to
energy
department
figures
dating
to
that
was
on
the
back
of
a
jump
in
crude
exports
to
a
weekly
record
of
more
than
million
bpd
so
when
does
the
send
a
delegate
to
opec
meetings
said
kyle
cooper
consultant
at
ion
energy
in
houston
it
s
really
quite
amazing
i
do
think
that
will
occur
more
and
more
often
in
coming
the
united
states
historically
has
been
a
heavy
importer
of
crude
oil
in
part
due
to
a
ban
on
crude
exports
that
was
lifted
in
late
by
barack
obama
petroleum
exports
until
recently
were
dominated
by
products
like
gasoline
and
diesel
but
that
has
changed
since
the
shale
revolution
that
has
sped
up
drilling
and
extraction
of
oil
helping
boost
overall
production
to
a
record
million
bpd
the
data
comes
on
the
same
day
that
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
adjourned
a
meeting
without
announcing
a
agreement
as
it
grapples
with
sinking
prices
due
in
part
to
the
surge
in
output
that
has
upended
the
global
supply
equation
crude
inventories
fell
million
barrels
last
week
the
first
drawdown
since
september
as
net
crude
imports
hit
a
record
low
of
million
bpd
the
energy
information
administration
said
on
thursday
graphic
turns
into
net
exporter
of
oil
crude
prices
have
sagged
almost
a
third
since
hitting
a
high
near
a
barrel
in
october
that
was
in
part
due
to
concerns
about
oversupply
coming
to
the
fore
again
as
production
rose
in
tandem
with
increased
output
from
saudi
arabia
and
russia
the
three
countries
are
the
world
s
largest
producers
of
oil
that
has
created
a
dilemma
for
opec
which
wants
to
maintain
higher
prices
but
avoid
ceding
more
market
share
to
shale
producers
on
thursday
opec
adjourned
its
meeting
in
vienna
aiming
to
reach
an
agreement
with
russia
on
friday
it
seems
eia
has
a
habit
of
sending
bad
news
to
opec
during
its
vienna
meetings
in
the
past
it
has
been
surging
production
numbers
but
this
time
was
truly
remarkable
and
historic
showing
data
for
net
crude
imports
as
bpd
said
joe
mcmonigle
analyst
at
hedgeye
in
washington
crude
production
is
expected
to
average
more
than
million
bpd
in
according
to
the
eia
an
increase
of
more
than
million
bpd
in
shale
production
surged
in
the
early
part
of
the
decade
as
companies
started
to
use
hydraulic
fracturing
or
fracking
to
extract
oil
in
basins
in
texas
north
dakota
and
other
states
output
rose
to
million
bpd
in
just
shy
of
the
nation
s
high
set
in
but
fell
off
when
opec
flooded
the
world
markets
with
supply
to
try
to
hinder
the
shale
industry
but
opec
was
forced
to
curb
output
in
as
nations
faced
budget
shortfalls
and
as
prices
recovered
shale
s
output
accelerated
every
single
month
every
single
year
we
re
going
to
become
more
of
a
global
pie
and
that
s
a
part
of
the
pie
you
can
t
control
it
s
completely
different
than
the
opec
piece
said
bernadette
johnson
vice
president
in
market
intelligence
at
drillinginfo
in
denver
for
the
week
the
united
states
also
posted
net
exports
of
million
bpd
of
products
like
gasoline
and
diesel
the
weekly
figures
are
subject
to
wide
fluctuations
however
so
the
sudden
shift
may
be
a
temporary
occurrence
andrew
lipow
president
of
lipow
oil
associates
in
houston
said
he
was
not
surprised
this
happened
in
the
winter
a
seasonally
slow
period
for
domestic
gasoline
demand
oil
prices
ended
thursday
lower
due
to
concern
that
planned
opec
production
cuts
will
be
smaller
than
originally
anticipated
crude
futures
lost
percent
on
the
day
while
brent
crude
dropped
by
percent
