wrapup 1-trump targets pair of obama-era green rules to boost oil, coal
washington
reuters
the
trump
administration
took
aim
at
two
environmental
policies
on
thursday
to
boost
the
oil
and
coal
industries
proposing
to
open
up
a
bird
s
wildlife
habitat
to
drilling
and
mining
and
remove
hurdles
to
new
power
plant
construction
the
moves
part
of
a
broader
agenda
by
president
donald
trump
to
revive
the
ailing
coal
industry
and
ramp
up
domestic
energy
production
come
amid
increasingly
urgent
warnings
from
within
his
own
government
about
climate
change
and
as
world
leaders
gather
at
a
united
nations
conference
to
combat
planetary
warming
announced
separately
by
trump
appointees
who
were
both
former
energy
lobbyists
the
proposals
cheered
the
coal
and
oil
industries
but
triggered
an
uproar
from
environmental
groups
who
raised
the
prospect
of
legal
challenges
trump
and
his
deputies
are
delivering
on
the
wish
list
of
the
coal
and
oil
industries
but
they
are
up
against
the
public
and
market
demand
for
clean
energy
said
mary
anne
hitt
senior
director
of
sierra
club
s
beyond
coal
campaign
the
interior
department
proposed
easing
protections
for
a
bird
the
greater
to
boost
oil
drilling
and
mining
across
western
states
potentially
opening
up
hundreds
of
thousands
of
acres
of
grouse
habitat
in
states
like
colorado
and
utah
to
oil
and
gas
leasing
announced
by
interior
department
deputy
secretary
david
bernhardt
a
colorado
native
and
a
former
energy
lobbyist
the
proposal
would
allow
for
changes
to
habitat
boundary
maps
of
the
prairie
fowl
considered
by
conservationists
to
be
a
key
indicator
species
for
america
s
dwindling
sagebrush
ecosystem
the
obama
administration
had
launched
the
plan
to
protect
the
in
september
as
an
alternative
to
listing
the
bird
under
the
endangered
species
act
a
move
that
would
potentially
have
entailed
even
tougher
habitat
protections
the
oil
and
mining
industries
however
have
said
the
limits
to
development
are
overreaching
also
on
thursday
the
environmental
protection
agency
proposed
rolling
back
an
rule
requiring
new
coal
plants
to
slash
carbon
emissions
a
move
that
could
crack
open
the
door
in
coming
years
for
new
plants
fired
by
the
fossil
fuel
rejecting
criticism
that
the
move
would
potentially
increase
carbon
emissions
acting
epa
administrator
andrew
wheeler
a
former
coal
lobbyist
argued
that
the
move
would
encourage
cleaner
coal
investments
in
the
united
states
which
would
then
be
exported
worldwide
and
help
reduce
global
emissions
it
is
unclear
if
the
move
will
spur
any
new
construction
of
coal
plants
in
the
united
states
however
as
many
utilities
turn
to
cheaper
natural
gas
and
renewables
like
solar
and
wind
energy
the
government
lists
only
two
major
power
plants
scheduled
to
come
online
over
the
next
five
years
with
more
than
scheduled
to
retire
over
the
same
period
since
taking
office
in
january
trump
has
made
a
habit
of
rolling
back
environmental
and
climate
protections
to
maximize
production
of
domestic
fossil
fuels
including
crude
oil
oil
production
is
already
the
highest
in
the
world
above
saudi
arabia
and
russia
after
a
boom
that
was
triggered
more
than
a
decade
ago
by
improved
drilling
technology
trump
s
agenda
to
encourage
more
fossil
fuels
use
clashes
with
a
congressionally
mandated
government
report
that
came
out
last
month
saying
climate
change
is
driven
mainly
by
human
activity
and
will
cost
the
economy
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
by
the
end
of
the
century
the
white
house
has
discounted
the
report
saying
it
fails
to
account
for
potential
advances
in
technology
that
could
make
burning
fossil
fuels
cleaner
in
the
future
