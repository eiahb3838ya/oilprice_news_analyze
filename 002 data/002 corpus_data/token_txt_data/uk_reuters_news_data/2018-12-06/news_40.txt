arrested
huawei
s
global
chief
financial
officer
in
vancouver
where
she
is
facing
extradition
to
the

states
the

is
related
to
violations
of
sanctions
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
said
though
officials
have
so
far
stayed
mum
on
her
allegations
the
arrest
heightened
the
sense
of
a
major
collision
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economic
powers
not
just
over
tariffs
but
also
over

hegemony

so
while
there
was
a
brief
moment
of
optimism
after
the

the
reality
is
it
won
t
be
that
easy
he
said

chinasoft
markets
had
initially
brightened
after
and
chinese
leaders
agreed
a
temporary
trade
truce
at
a
meeting
on
saturday
but
the
mood
has
quickly
soured
on
scepticism
that
the
two
sides
can
reach
a
substantive
deal
on
a

of
hugely

worries
about
a

shuji
shirota
head
of

economic
strategy
at
hsbc
if
the
upcoming

data
on
friday
shows
some
weakness
markets
will
face
a
major

he
added
the
inversion
is
a
symptom
of
a
weak
economy
said
bryan
whalen
group
managing
director
of
tcw
in
los
angeles
noting
the
economy
has
not
been
able
to
achieve
sustainable
economic
growth
of
more
than
two
percent
in
recent
years
if
the

t
break
the
two
percent

environment
with
interest
rates
and
a
rapidly
expanding
balance
sheet
early
in
the
economic
cycle
why
would
you
ever
think
we
could
do
it
when
interest
rates
are
rising
and
balance
sheet
is
shrinking
and
we
are
basically
years
into
an
aging
economic
cycle
he
said
it
s
hard
to
envision
a
scenario
where
growth
doesn
t
dip

aimed
at
draining

has
pulled
down
crude

of

and
its

including

agreed
on
the
need
to
