update 2-u.s. senators grapple with ways to punish saudis over khashoggi death
washington
reuters
senators
bent
on
punishing
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
for
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
said
on
thursday
they
want
to
vote
next
week
to
penalize
riyadh
but
struggled
to
agree
on
how
best
to
do
so
despite
president
donald
trump
s
desire
to
maintain
close
ties
to
saudi
arabia
several
of
his
fellow
republicans
have
joined
democrats
in
blaming
the
crown
prince
for
khashoggi
s
death
and
backing
legislation
to
respond
by
ending
support
for
the
war
effort
in
yemen
imposing
new
sanctions
and
stopping
weapons
sales
but
others
strongly
oppose
linking
the
yemen
conflict
with
the
killing
of
the
journalist
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
fracture
that
relationship
with
the
saudis
it
s
not
based
on
friendship
as
much
as
it
s
based
on
common
interests
combating
extremism
in
the
middle
east
and
countering
the
iranian
threat
said
senator
john
cornyn
the
chamber
s
no
republican
five
republican
and
democratic
senators
met
behind
closed
doors
on
thursday
morning
to
discuss
how
to
move
ahead
saying
afterward
they
had
not
yet
come
up
with
a
compromise
that
could
win
enough
bipartisan
support
to
pass
the
senate
the
lack
of
agreement
contrasted
with
some
senators
harsh
words
on
tuesday
against
the
crown
prince
the
de
facto
ruler
of
the
kingdom
who
has
denied
knowledge
of
the
operation
that
killed
khashoggi
on
in
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
a
briefing
by
central
intelligence
agency
director
gina
haspel
for
senators
on
tuesday
hardened
their
resolve
to
act
against
the
prince
known
as
mbs
who
has
the
support
of
trump
there
are
three
different
measures
making
their
way
through
the
senate
a
war
powers
resolution
ending
any
involvement
in
the
yemen
conflict
legislation
imposing
a
broad
clampdown
on
saudi
arabia
including
ending
arms
sales
and
levying
new
sanctions
and
a
nonbinding
resolution
targeting
the
crown
prince
the
senate
is
expected
to
vote
on
the
war
powers
resolution
next
week
but
lawmakers
have
not
yet
agreed
on
how
or
whether
it
should
be
amended
some
have
questioned
whether
the
resolution
is
even
legal
and
others
said
they
want
a
response
to
khashoggi
s
death
but
agree
with
the
trump
administration
that
washington
should
continue
to
back
the
saudis
as
an
essential
counterweight
to
iran
saudi
arabia
is
leading
a
campaign
in
yemen
against
the
houthis
shi
ite
muslim
fighters
that
yemen
s
neighbours
view
as
agents
of
iran
the
war
has
killed
more
than
people
and
created
the
world
s
most
urgent
humanitarian
crisis
fourteen
republicans
who
hold
a
slim
majority
in
the
senate
and
rarely
break
from
the
president
have
already
defied
trump
and
voted
with
democrats
in
favour
of
moving
ahead
with
the
war
powers
resolution
but
to
become
law
the
resolution
would
not
just
have
to
pass
the
senate
this
month
but
also
must
pass
the
house
of
representatives
and
be
signed
by
trump
neither
of
which
is
expected
this
year
however
backers
said
senate
passage
alone
would
still
be
an
important
step
a
vote
on
the
resolution
is
a
very
tough
message
to
saudi
arabia
that
the
relationship
is
changing
and
you
can
interpret
that
as
a
message
on
the
yemen
war
but
you
can
also
interpret
that
as
a
message
on
khashoggi
democratic
senator
chris
murphy
a
told
reporters
it
was
not
immediately
clear
whether
the
broader
legislation
would
come
up
for
a
senate
vote
before
lawmakers
go
home
for
the
year
and
a
new
congress
is
seated
in
january
or
whether
some
provisions
might
be
added
to
the
war
powers
measure
republican
senator
bob
corker
chairman
of
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
who
is
retiring
this
month
said
he
hoped
to
hold
a
hearing
early
next
week
on
the
broader
legislation
senator
lindsey
graham
one
of
the
most
vocal
critics
of
saudi
arabia
who
is
close
to
trump
introduced
the
senate
resolution
with
two
other
republicans
and
three
democrats
that
measure
is
intended
to
hold
the
saudi
crown
prince
accountable
for
contributing
to
the
humanitarian
crisis
in
yemen
a
blockade
of
qatar
the
jailing
of
dissidents
and
khashoggi
s
death
but
it
imposes
no
penalties
on
riyadh
graham
said
he
supported
the
idea
of
stopping
aid
for
the
war
in
yemen
but
thought
the
war
powers
resolution
was
not
constitutional
many
lawmakers
have
been
calling
for
months
for
an
end
to
refueling
of
saudi
jets
that
bomb
yemen
often
killing
civilians
but
the
murder
of
khashoggi
a
resident
and
washington
post
columnist
added
to
frustration
with
the
kingdom
and
prompted
even
stronger
demands
for
a
shift
in
relations
