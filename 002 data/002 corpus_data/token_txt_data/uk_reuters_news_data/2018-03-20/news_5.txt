on
tuesday
auctioned
off
more
than
acres
hectares
in
southeastern
utah
for
oil
and
gas
development
a
sign
of
strong
industry
demand
in
a
region
conservationists
have
vowed
to
protect
the
utah
lease
sale
included
terrain
near
the
former
boundaries
of
the
bears
ears
national
monument
whose

scaled
back
by
the
trump
administration
last
year
as
well
as
the
hovenweep
and
canyons
of
the
ancients
monuments
according
to

showed
that
all

received
winning
bids
which
averaged
per
acre
and
ranged
between
and
per
acre
total
proceeds
from
the
auction
were
million
according
to
the
blm
this
means
drilling
in
these
parcels
poses
a
more
serious
and
immediate
threat
to
the
landscape
and
archaeological
resources
aaron
weiss
media
director
for
the
center
for
western
priorities
said
about

inc
according
to
the
data
the
auction
comes
as
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
seeks
to
boost
domestic
energy
production
by
expanding
federal
leasing
and
rolling
back
land
protections
local
officials
have
been
eager
to
open
up
the
areas
administered
by
the
blm
saying
resource
extraction
is
one
of
few
economic
opportunities
for
rural
san
juan
county
one
of
utah
s
poorest
areas
oil
and
gas
operations
are
an
important
contributor
to
a
diversified
county
economy
and
the
county
supports
leasing
as
a
necessary
step
toward
realizing
economic
benefits
county
planner
nick
sanberg
said
in
comments
to
the
blm
but
conservation
groups
fumed
threatening
lawsuits
we
won
t
sit
idly
by
while
president
trump
and
interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
auction
off
america
s
cultural
and
public
lands
heritage
to
the
oil
and
gas
industry
said
stephen
bloch
legal
director
with
the
southern
utah
wilderness
alliance
the
alliance
argued
that
the
blm
did
not
adequately
study
potential
impacts
on
wilderness
and
cultural
sites
southeastern
utah
s
dramatic
landscapes
are
rich
in
native
american
artifacts
historical
sites
and
dinosaur
fossils
a
near
bears
ears
received
a
winning
bid
of
per
acre
while
parcels
near
the
nearby
hovenweep
monument
sold
at
an
average
of
per
acre
a
bid
of
per
acre
won
a
parcel
next
to
canyons
of
the
ancients
national
monument
the
results
were
more
competitive
than
those
of
a
lease
sale
last
week
in
which
a
parcel
near
the
upper
missouri
river
breaks
national
monument
sold
for
the
minimum
per
acre
zinke
this
month
deferred
or
scaled
back
two
other
lease
sales
near
archaeological
and
tourist
sites
in
new
mexico
and
his
home
state
of
montana
amid
local
outcry
and
opposition
from
state
lawmakers
the
blm
was
not
immediately
available
for
comment
but
said
it
would
post
results
of
the
sale
including
names
of
winning
bidders
by
wednesday
morning
other
recent
lease
sales
have
yielded
relatively
low
bids
a
reflection
of
soft
demand
for
federal
property
as
the
oil
and
gas
industry
taps
vast
reserves
on
private
lands
