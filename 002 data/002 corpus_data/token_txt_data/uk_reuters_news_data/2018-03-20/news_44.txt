reuters
glencore
is
buying
rio
tinto
s
hail
creek
coal
mine
and
the
valeria
coal
project
in
australia
for
billion
tightening
the
swiss
trading
and
mining
giant
s
grip
on
coal
as
its
rivals
exit
the
industry
the
acquisition
announced
by
both
companies
on
tuesday
follows
glencore
s
purchase
of
half
of
rio
tinto
s
hunter
valley
coal
operations
also
in
australia
for
billion
last
year
in
a
deal
with
china
s
yancoal
australia
glencore
is
already
the
world
s
biggest
exporter
of
thermal
coal
used
for
power
stations
and
hail
creek
will
give
it
a
bigger
stake
in
metallurgical
coal
used
for
steelmaking
you
ve
got
one
of
the
few
big
companies
in
glencore
that
is
both
willing
and
able
and
clearly
likes
coal
strategically
and
has
been
acquiring
these
assets
said
paul
gait
an
analyst
at
bernstein
in
london
the
sale
consists
of
rio
s
percent
interest
in
the
hail
creek
operating
mine
and
its
percent
interest
in
the
valeria
project
the
company
said
in
a
statement
rio
tinto
made
a
strategic
decision
in
to
exit
coal
and
focus
on
growth
in
iron
ore
copper
and
its
aluminum
division
on
tuesday
it
said
it
was
still
looking
to
sell
its
remaining
australian
coal
assets
the
kestrel
coking
coal
mine
and
the
winchester
south
development
project
investors
had
expected
the
two
mines
and
projects
to
be
sold
as
a
package
the
best
option
to
extract
value
for
our
shareholders
is
to
go
in
a
piecemeal
approach
rio
chief
executive
jacques
told
reporters
after
a
business
event
in
melbourne
analysts
said
the
price
for
hail
creek
and
valeria
looked
good
for
rio
tinto
while
not
too
expensive
for
glencore
given
we
all
expected
a
billion
to
billion
number
for
hail
creek
plus
kestrel
and
the
other
stuff
it
s
a
pretty
big
number
said
shaw
and
partners
analyst
peter
o
connor
in
sydney
rio
s
shares
rose
percent
while
glencore
s
were
flat
gait
said
that
he
was
bullish
on
metallurgical
coal
prices
now
above
a
ton
which
would
help
justify
the
price
glencore
agreed
to
pay
glencore
clearly
have
synergies
in
terms
of
both
the
operating
and
physically
the
marketing
of
these
assets
and
when
i
look
at
the
price
that
they
ve
acquired
these
things
for
it
doesn
t
seem
to
me
to
be
exorbitant
he
said
rio
tinto
said
it
planned
to
use
the
sale
proceeds
for
general
corporate
purposes
however
jacques
did
not
rule
out
returning
the
cash
to
shareholders
in
future
you
shouldn
t
draw
any
conclusions
the
next
time
we
review
it
will
be
in
august
he
told
reporters
referring
to
the
company
s
next
moves
on
capital
management
ubs
has
forecast
that
the
sale
of
hail
creek
and
kestrel
could
help
rio

back
more
than
billion
to
shareholders
over
the
next
months
the
hail
creek
deal
is
subject
to
regulatory
approvals

which
all
have
