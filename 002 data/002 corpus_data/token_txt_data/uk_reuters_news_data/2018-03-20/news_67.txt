president
donald
trump
on
monday
signed
an
executive
order
barring
any
financial
transactions
involving

s
new

as
officials
warned
that
it
was
a
scam
by
president
nicolas
maduro
s
government
to
further
undermine
democracy
in
the
opec
country
the
petro
is
a
desperate
effort
by
a
corrupt
regime
to
defraud
international
investors
a
senior
administration
official
told
reporters
strongly
warning
that
any
transactions
in
the
petro
digital
currency
would
violate
sanctions
investing
in
the
petro
should
be
viewed
as
directly
supporting
this
dictatorship
and
its
attempts
to
undermine
the
democratic
order
in
venezuela
the
official
added
trump
s
order
bars
all

united
states
person
or
within
the
united
states
any
digital
currency
digital
coin
or
digital

issued
by
venezuela
s
government
since
the
white
house
said
in
a
statement
maduro
is
hoping
will
help
venezuela
skirt
financial
sanctions
as
it
struggles
under
hyperinflation
and
a
collapsing
socialist
economy
venezuela
rejected
the
sanctions
which
it
says
are
illegal
under
international
law
these
unilateral
sanctions
constitute
a
new
imperial
aggression
aimed
at
intensifying
the
attack
on
our
people
the
government
said
in
a
statement
the
order
comes
as
the
trump
administration
is
actively
exploring
options
to
sanction
venezuela

preparing
a
new

gold
that
will
be
backed
by
precious
metals
any
transactions
of
the
venezuelan
petro
conducted
before
monday
s
order
would
be
considered
on
a
basis
a
second
administration
official
said
we
would
base
our
licensing
determinations
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
those
particular
applications
the
second
official
added
the
united
states
is
considered
a
crucial
source
of
capital
for
securities
and
tokens
because
of
the
size
of
its
economy
and
because
many
global
financial
operations
at
some
point
pass
through
financial
institutions
in
addition
the
treasury
announced
sanctions
against
four
venezuelan
government
officials
for
corruption
and
economic
mismanagement
the
senior
administration
official
said
the
sanctions
against
the
four
officials
were
not
directly
linked
to
the
