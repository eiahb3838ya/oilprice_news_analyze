volkswagen
is
looking
at
ways
to
boost
production
at
skoda
including
building
a
new
factory
outside
the
brand
s
czech
home
to
help
it
keep
up
with
booming
demand
company
sources
said
best
known
for
its
cars
skoda
moved
last
year
into
the
market
for
vehicles
suvs
with
the
new
kodiaq
and
karoq
models
and
plans
to
launch
another
models
by
but
attempts
to
increase
capacity
at
its
main
czech
plant
in
mlada
boleslav
where
it
builds
more
than
half
a
million
cars
a
year
are
in
limbo
because
the
kovo
union
opposes

volkswagen
vw
group
sources
said
skoda
has
offered
to
create
jobs
in
the
czech
republic
if
labor
leaders
agree
to
additional
shifts
at
the
two
automaking
plants
a
move
management
says
could
boost
output
at
mlada
boleslav
alone
by
cars
a
year
additional
capacity
is
absolutely
essential
to
be
able
to
meet
continually
growing
demand
skoda
said
in
an
emailed
statement
the
company
has
been
producing
at
full
capacity
for
some
once
the
butt
of
jokes
in
the
west
skoda
has
blossomed
under
nearly
years
of
vw
ownership
to
become
one
of
its
profit
drivers
even
beating
luxury
brand
audi
s
and
bmw
s
operating
margins
last
year
thanks
to
its
cheap
labor
and
to
vw
s
modular
production
platforms
growing
demand
in
europe
and
china
has
helped
skoda
s
sales
to
jump
nearly
a
third
over
the
past
five
years
to
a
record
million
cars
in
sources
said
skoda
could
miss
out
on
about
car
sales
by
if
capacity
is
left
unchanged
production
of
skoda
models
has
been
expanded
in
recent
years
in
markets
including
china
india
and
russia
vw
and
skoda
are
aiming
to
find
solutions
by
the
summer
the
sources
said
to
help
the
brand
with
its
goal
to
expand
foreign
sales
to
countries
from
about
by
deliberations
include
searching
for
capacity
within
the
vw
group
as
well
as
investing
in
a
new
facility
outside
the
czech
republic
where
production
could
be
shared
with
other
vw
brands
the
sources
said
of
course
we
are
always
pleased
if
brands
like
skoda
develop
very
positively
but
that
also
affects
other
brands
where
we
have
bottlenecks
vw
group
chief
executive
matthias
mueller
told
reuters
tv
last
week
when
asked
how
he
wanted
to
solve
capacity
constraints
at
skoda
our
platform
strategy
thankfully
gives
us
a
chance
to
also
react
at
short
notice
meaning
within
a
few
weeks
or
months
he
said
referring
to
the
group
s
strategy
of
maximizing
the
number
of
parts
used
in
common
across
brand
and
model
lines
last
year
labor
leaders
at
the
group
s
vw
brand
pushed
for
some
skoda
production
to
be
shifted
from
the
czech
republic
to
help
offset
declining
output
at
german
sites
fuelling
concerns
among
some
czech
workers
and
politicians
it
remains
unclear
where
skoda
models
could
be
built
the
vw
brand
s
main
wolfsburg
plant
in
germany
is
grappling
with
falling
demand
for
its
golf
hatchback
but
utilization
has
improved
at
a
fellow
german
plant
in
emden
which
has
been
awarded
production
of
another
model
and
so
sees
no
room
to
build
skodas
before
a
vw
source
said
audi
says
capacity
is
tight
at
its
main
ingolstadt
plant
in
germany
where
some
models
are
based
on
the
mqb
platform
shared
by
skoda
vw
s
spanish
brand
seat
is
also
operating
near
full
capacity
at
martorell
after
the
new
arona
suv
was
added
to
assembly
lines
and
the
brand
has
swapped
production
of
the
audi
for
the
audi
to
ease
workload
at
the
factory
but
in
the
wake
of
the
group
s
costly
diesel
emissions
scandal
it
is
likely
to
want
to
tap
any
capacity
across
the
business
ahead
of
building
a
new
factory
vw
finance
chief
frank
witter
last
week
reaffirmed
the
group
s
goal
to
cut
both
capital
spending
and
r
d
costs
to
percent
of
sales
by
from
percent
and
percent
respectively
i
have
said
all
along
that
and
will
be
a
dog
fight
and
i
haven
t
changed
my
view
witter
also
skoda
s
chairman
said
on
an
earnings
call
at
skoda
management
are
determined
not
to
lose
momentum
we
are
intensively
pushing
forward
skoda
ceo
bernhard
maier
said
at
the
geneva
auto
show
this
month
we
are
motivated
from
head
to
toe
to
continue
