the
price
of
carbon
credits
must
rise
drastically
if
they
are
to
help
protect
southeast
asia
s
tropical
forests
against
rubber
plantation
expansion
according
to
researchers
individuals
companies
and
countries
purchase
carbon
credits
to
offset
their
greenhouse
gas
emissions
putting
a
cost
on
carbon
emissions
provides
an
incentive
to
do
business
more
sustainably
and
a
disincentive
to
engage
in
environmentally
damaging
activities
like
clearing
forests
but
researchers
found
that
credits
bought
and
sold
on
international
markets
would
need
to
rise
from
per
tonne
of
carbon
dioxide
to
per
tonne
if
they
are
to
safeguard
southeast
asian
forests
from
rubber
at
current
prices
carbon
credits
can
not
compete
with
the
profits
to
be
made
from
felling
forests
and
developing
rubber
plantations
according
to
the
report
published
this
month
in
the
journal
nature
communications
we
looked
at
rubber
as
an
economic
driver
of
deforestation
said
eleanor
the
lead
researcher
who
was
at
britain
s
university
of
east
anglia
when
she
worked
on
the
study
what
kind
of
profits
can
you
make
from
rubber
plantations
and
what
kind
incentive
to
preserve
forests
do
you
need
to
provide
through
carbon
finance
such
a
large
study
has
not
been
done
before
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
most
forest
conservation
efforts
in
the
region
tend
to
focus
on
palm
oil
expansion
and
the
growth
of
rubber
plantations
has
received
little
attention
said
rubber
demand
rose
over
the
last
years
as
emerging
markets
like
china
and
india
became
wealthier
and
more
people
were
able
to
buy
cars
and
motorcycles
rubber
plantations
cover
about
million
hectares
around
the
world
of
which
are
in
southeast
asia
while
annual
expansion
rates
roughly
doubled
between
said
converting
forests
to
rubber
plantations
results
in
net
carbon
emissions
as
the
carbon
stored
in
the
trees
is
released
into
the
atmosphere
but
that
is
not
widely
recognised
in
the
industry
the
researchers
said
rubber
is
from
trees
and
so
it
looks
like
you
ve
replaced
one
kind
of
forest
with
another
said
tom
evans
an
conservation
director
at
the
wildlife
conservation
society
which
was
involved
in
the
report
but
really
you
ve
replaced
a
high
carbon
system
that
provides
a
lot
of
other
ecosystems
services
with
a
much
lower
carbon
pledges
made
by
governments
and
large
tyre
companies
as
well
as
the
enforcement
of
forest
protection
laws
are
crucial
to
curb
rubber
expansion
the
report
said
besides
higher
carbon
credit
prices
it
also
recommended
further
development
of
synthetic
alternatives
to
natural
rubber
and
improvements
in
recycling
of
natural
rubber
the
researchers
focused
on
forests
in
cambodia
but
those
in
china
laos
myanmar
and
vietnam
are
also
under
threat
from
rubber
