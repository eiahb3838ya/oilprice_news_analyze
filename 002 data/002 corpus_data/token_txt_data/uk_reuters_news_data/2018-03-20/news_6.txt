new

reuters
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
signaled
on
tuesday
that
the
trump
administration
was
backing
off
efforts
to
make
major
changes
to
the
nation
s
biofuels
program
and
may
leave
it
to
lawmakers
to
settle
the
divisive
issue
instead
the
white
house
spent
the
last
few
weeks
trying
to
negotiate
a
heated
dispute
between
the
corn
and
oil
industries
key
constituencies
for
president
donald
trump
over
the
future
of
the
renewable
fuel
program
a
regulation
that
requires
refiners
to
blend
increasing
volumes
of
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
fuel
the
rfs
has
created
a
lucrative
market
for
midwest
corn
farmers
but
refiners
who
must
prove
compliance
by
earning
or
purchasing
blending
credits
say
it
is
too
costly
perdue
said
he
and
environmental
protection
agency
chief
scott
pruitt
sent
the
white
house
a
list
of
options
but
it
was
unclear
if
trump
would
ultimately
implement
changes
to
the
rfs
on
the
executive
level
as
has
been
widely
expected
or
whether
it
would
instead
leave
reforms
to
congress
the
white
house
is
trying
to
determine
whether
they
need
to
make
a
call
on
a
decision
or
allow
congress
to
do
it
perdue
said
perdue
s
comments
marked
the
first
time
the
administration
has
signaled
a
willingness
to
let
lawmakers
take
control
said
stephen
brown
a
lobbyist
for
refinery
andeavor
which
has
supported
the
legislative
pathway
a
handful
of
merchant
refiners
have
continued
to
agitate
for
any
relief
even
regulatory
that
could
prove
to
be
fleeting
brown
said
they
are
so
removed
from
where
the
rest
of
the
refining
sector
as
to
be
considered
essentially
irrelevant
at
this
perdue
did
say
the
trump
administration
can
make
the
nation
s
biofuel
laws
more
affordable
for
oil
refiners
without
putting
a
cap
on
prices
for
the
tradable
credits
at
the
center
of
the
program
we
re
hoping
that
we
can
resolve
it
where
we
will
not
see
rins
capped
perdue
said
referring
to
the
name
of
the
credits
he
said
he
instead
favored
expanding
high
ethanol
blend
gasoline
sales
year
round
something
he
said
would
increase
the
rin
availability
guiding
rin
prices
perdue
made
the
comments
during
a
speech
at
the
national
press
club
in
washington
a
video
of
the
speech
was
provided
to
reuters
reports
that
the
trump
administration
was
backing
off
its
plans
to
enforce
changes
to
the
program
caused
ethanol
credit
prices
to
rise
by
cents
coming
off
a
low
of
cents
earlier
in
the
day
traders
said
the
prices
have
plummeted
by
percent
in
recent
weeks
amid
political
uncertainty
in
washington
the
efforts
by
the
white
house
have
drawn
sharp
criticism
from
ethanol
producers
and
lawmakers
who
say
trump
pledged
to
preserve
the
rfs
on
the
campaign
trail
the
republican
president
has
expressed
support
in
the
past
for
capping
rin
prices
in
exchange
for
allowing
sales
of
higher
ethanol
blends
of
gasoline
all
year
round
the
fueling
american
jobs
coalition
a
group
of
merchant
refiners
said
it
remained
optimistic
that
trump
would
eventually
reach
a
compromise
that
contained
credit
costs
those
who
make
money
off
of
rins
a
windfall
never
intended
when
the
program
was
established
obviously
see
it
differently
but
haven
t
exactly
been
in
the
relevant
meetings

coalition
