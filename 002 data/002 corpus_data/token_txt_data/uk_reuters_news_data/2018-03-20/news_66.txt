of
the

seven
weeks
by
a

of

according

the

has
come
from

the

there
are
no

slightly
more
cautious
about
the
prospect
of
a

increase
in
oil
prices
following
the
strong
rally
between
june
and
january
but
few
are
willing
to
bet
prices

drop
back
much
the
fund
community
still
expects
oil
prices
to
rise
further
but
it
has
inevitably
and
logically
become
slightly
less
bullish

prices
have
risen
by

there
has

more
