and
two
former
top
executives
to
have
civil
fraud
charges
over
a
failed
african
coal
project
dismissed
the
filing
is
the
latest
salvo
in
the
sec
s
lawsuit
accusing
the
defendants
of
waiting
too
long
to
write
down
the
coal
assets
enabling
the
big
mining
company
to
raise
about
billion
from
investors
defendants
violated
multiple
provisions
of
the
federal
securities
laws
by
engaging
in
a
prolonged
fraudulent
course
of
conduct
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
said
in
a
filing
with
the
district
court
in
manhattan
accordingly
the

tom
albanese
and
former
chief
financial

an
emailed
comment
a
rio
tinto
spokesman
said
rio
tinto
believes
that
the
sec
case
is
unwarranted
and
that
when
all
the
facts
are
considered
by
the
court
or
if
necessary
by
a
jury
the
sec
s
claims
will
be
rio
tinto
had
acquired
the
coal
assets
in
a
takeover
of
riversdale
mining
and
later
renamed
rio
tinto
coal
mozambique
for
about
billion
it
wrote
off
most
of
the
assets
in
january
and
sold
them
in
late
for
just
million
on
march
the
defendants
said
the
sec
was
plainly
wrong
to
say
they
should
have
taken
a
big
writedown
no
later
than
months
after
the
purchase
they
said
rising
prices
for
scarce
coking
coal
offset
lower
barging
and
rail
capacity
and
might
have
even
boosted
the
assets
value
at
that
time
the
sec
said
that
the
defendants
were
wrong
to
argue
that
it
was
too
soon
to
book
an
impairment
on
rio
tinto
coal
mozambique
rtcm
rio
tinto
was
required
to
assess
impairment
at
every
reporting
period
it
said
the
defendants
have
until
march
to
respond
court
records
show
the
case
is
being
overseen
by
district
judge
analisa
torres
in
manhattan
on
march
the
australian
securities
and
investments
commission
brought
its
own
civil
court
