middle
east
in
an
iranian
new

message
khamenei
did
not
specify

he
appeared

be
mainly
referring

the
islamic
state
militant
group
which
iranian
forces
have
confronted
in
syria
and
iraq
as
well
as

has
also
been
locked
in
a
regional
power

which
has
extended
to
the
war
in
yemen
and
to
lebanon
last
year
the
islamic
republic
defused
regional
threats
one
of
their
aims
was
to
harm
the
islamic
republic
khamenei
said
in
a
broadcast
on
state
television
these
threats
did
not
damage
our
country
but
turned
into
in
november
tehran
declared
the
end
of
islamic
state
and
hailed
the
iranian
soldiers
killed
fighting
against
it
in
syria
and
iraq
iran
has
provided
critical
military
support
to
syrian
president
bashar
helping
his
army
regain
swathes
of
land
from
rebels
and
militants
in
recent
months
our
humble
soldiers
and
tireless
diplomats
were
able
to
stand
with
the
people
of
iraq
syria
and
lebanon
to
establish
stability
and
increase
security
for
the
region
president
hassan
rouhani
said
in
his
new
year
message
president
donald
trump
who
sees
iran
as
a
threat
to
stability
in
the
middle
east
has
pledged
to
work
with
gulf
arab
states
and
israel
to
curb
what
they
say
are
tehran
s
attempts
to
extend
its
influence
in
the
region
trump
sent
greetings
on
monday
to
iranians
celebrating
the
new
year
s
holiday
known
as
nowruz
but
used
the
message
to
attack
iran
s
government
particularly
its
powerful
islamic
revolutionary
guard
corps
trump
has
threatened
to
pull
the
united
states
out
of
the
agreement
between
world
powers
and
tehran
which
limited
iran
s
nuclear
programmes
in
return
for
a
lifting
of
sanctions
trump
said
in
his
nowruz
message
that
tehran
had
spent
more
than
billion
to
prop
up
syria
s
government
and
support
militants
in
syria
iraq
and
yemen
many
iranians
however
resent
the
foreign
interventions
and
want
their
leaders
to
create
more
jobs
at
home
where
youth
unemployment
stood
at
per
cent
this
year
protests
swept
the
country
in
december
with
young
demonstrators
asking
for
jobs
and
calling
for
more
freedom
the
unrest
resulted
in
deaths
and
nearly
people
reportedly
were
arrested
khamenei
said
on
tuesday
the
protests
were
the
enemies
plot
against
iran
and
were
promptly
defused
rouhani
who
is
under
pressure
for
his
economic
record
took
a
softer
stance
against
protesters
the
people
said
that
criticising
and
protesting
is
the
right
of
the
people
but
the
wise
people
of
iran
will
not
accept
lawlessness
will
not
accept
violence

his
new
year
