on
tuesday
ahead
of
a

reassessed
their

tech
stocks
underperformed

as
the

fell
percent
taking
its
cue
from
monday
s
falls
for
peers
on
the
back
of
fears
of

have
improperly

weighed
on

around

there
certainly
are
some
stocks
where
valuations
look
somewhat
stretched
so
we
re
focusing
our
exposure
within
the
technology
sector
on
the
cheaper
end
of
the
market
mike

global

strategist
at

said
we
re
a
bit
more
cautious
on
the

reached

on

chairman
jerome
powell
s
first

meeting
starting
later
in
the

and
amid
concerns
that

impose
additional
protectionist
trade
measures
investors
lightened
their
positions
ahead
of
the
fed
s
policy
meeting
the
markets
are
completely
split
on
whether
the
fed
will
project
three
rate
hikes
this
year
or
four
said
hiroaki

at

in
addition
worries
about
the
potential
for
a

cast
a
shadow
after

imposed

on

the

administration
is
also
expected
to

up
to

on
monday
urging
trump
not
to
impose
massive
tariffs
on
goods
imported

were
muted
yields
rose
ahead
of
an
expected
rate
hike
from
the
federal
reserve
after
its
policy
meeting
starting
on
tuesday
the
yield
on
treasuries
was
little
changed
at
percent
basis
points
below
the
high
of
percent
touched
a
month
ago
but
the
yield
on
notes
hit
a
high
of
percent
on
monday
as
the
fed
appears
set
to
bump
up
its
policy
interest
rates
to
percent
from
the
current
percent
still
with
a

gained
from
the
prospect
of

the

moderated

bouncing
on
monday
following
a

that
european
central
bank
officials
were
shifting
their
debate
from
bond
purchases
to
the
expected
path
of
interest
rates
the
yen
was
little
changed
at
per
dollar
with

wary
of
any
new
developments
in
a
cronyism
scandal
that
has
eroded
support
for

edged
slightly
higher

remained
wary
of

between
