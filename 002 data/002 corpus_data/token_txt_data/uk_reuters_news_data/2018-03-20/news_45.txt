giant
trafigura
has
moved
its
commodities
hedging
operations
to
the
united
states
and
asia
and
away
from
europe
to
avoid
being
subject
to
new
tighter
mifid
ii
market
regulations
we
moved
our
hedging
business
away
from
europe
into
the
and
singapore
and
other
locations
chief
financial
officer
christophe
salmon
told
reporters
trafigura
was
one
of
the
main
critics
of
europe
s
mifid
ii
regulations
saying
it
would
drive
business
away
from
the
continent
as
it
was
introducing
unnecessary
complications
to
operations
mifid
ii
introduced
position
limits
on
contracts
such
as
brent
oil
or
refined
products
but
many
traders
have
long
argued
that
they
hold
large
positions
in
paper
markets
to
hedge
risks
in
the
physical
market
rather
than
for
purely
speculative
purposes
trafigura
trades
around
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
oil
and
refined
products
roughly
on
par
with
rival
glencore
but

you
don
t
want
to
diversify
for
the
sake
of
it
you
have
to
be
in
the
top
in
any
commodity
you
trade
it
is
extremely
important
to
maintain
scale
chief
executive
jeremy
weir
told
the
same
briefing
weir
said
trafigura
has
been
actively
aggregating
volumes
from
independent
producers
for
exports
to
capitalise
on
its
infrastructure
amid
a
boom
in
shale
oil
he
said
trafigura
has
been
the
largest
crude
and
condensate
exporter
over
the
past
year

said
the
company
was
bullish
on

the
due
to
a
shortage

new
projects
peak
demand
is
a
long
long
way
away
in
the
future
shale
oil
is
not
a
panacea
for
global
oil
production
weir
said
luckock
said
oil
basin
of
permian
can
not
be
the
only
solution
to
world
oil
supply
while
demand
is
growing
by
million
bpd
in
the
oil
industry
it
should
be
a
marathon
but
people
are
running
it
at
a
sprint
pace
they
are
doing
an
amazing
job
but
growth
is
tiring
