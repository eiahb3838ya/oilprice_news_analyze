hampered
industrial
machinery
designed
to
optimize
output
when
conditions
are
most
frigid
production

sheldon
fisher
told
state

are
largely
to
blame
for

has
been
warmer
in
this
winter
fisher
told
the
state
senate
s
finance
committee
we

do
better
when
the
winter
is
colder
the
equipment
operates
better
and
they
re
able
to
accomplish
more
with
colder
declines
in
production
were
most
pronounced
at
the
giant
prudhoe
bay
field
which
is
particularly
sensitive
to
temperature
changes
dan
stickel
chief
economist
for
the
state
s
department
of

told
the

temperatures
were
degrees
warmer
than
the

cold
conditions
have
long
been
better
for
north
slope
production
said
cathy
foerster
a

oil

conservation
commission
the
facilities
up
there
are
designed
to
operate
at
their
maximum
when
it
s
cold
she
said
noting
that
production
is
highest
in
the
coldest
months
and
lowest
in
summer
among
the
facilities
are
those
handling
natural
gas
which
is
cycled
through
the
fields
to
enhance

recovery
she
said
north
slope
oil
production
is
expected
to
recover
somewhat
in

months
bringing

to
barrels
per
day
according
to
the
state
officials
forecast
which

produced
semiannually
production
in
the
coming
fiscal
year
is
expected
to
average
barrels
per

then
decline
gradually
to
barrels
per

by
fiscal
the
gradual
nature
of
the
decline
is
an
improvement
from
past
years
when
north

output
fell
much
more
sharply
fisher
told
lawmakers
north
slope
production
peaked
in
at
over
million
barrels
per
day
the
decline
has
been
at
the
heart
of
a
fiscal
problem
for
the
state
government
which
faces
a
budget
deficit
of
over
billion
this
year
