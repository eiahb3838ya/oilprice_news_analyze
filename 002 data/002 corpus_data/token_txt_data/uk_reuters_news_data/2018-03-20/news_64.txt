the
international
energy
agency
said
last
week
that
venezuela
where
an
economic
crisis
has
cut
oil
production
by
almost
half
since
early
to
well
below
million
bpd
was
clearly
vulnerable
to
an
accelerated
decline
and
that
such
a
disruption
could
tip
global
markets
into

falls
on
global
share
markets
helped
cap
gains
markets
are
under
pressure
from
concerns
over
a
possible
trade
war
between
the
united
states
and
other
major
economies
as
well
as
from
fears
of
stiffer

also
looming
over

has
been
surging
crude
oil
production
which
has
risen
by
more
than
a
fifth
since
to
million
barrels
per

bpd
pushing
it
past
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
only
russia
produces
more
at
around
million
bpd
although
output
is
expected
to
overtake
russia
s
later
this
year
as
well
soaring
output
as
well
as
rising
output
in
canada
and
brazil
is
undermining
efforts
by
the
middle
east
dominated
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
to
curb
supplies
and
bolster
prices
many
analysts
expect
global
oil
markets
to
flip
from
slight
undersupply
in
and
early
this
year
into
oversupply
