german
prosecutors
said
on
tuesday
they
had
searched
volkswagen
s
headquarters
as

a
new
investigation
into
whether
the
carmaker
had
overstated
the
fuel
efficiency
of
more
vehicles
than
previously
disclosed
the
news
is
the
latest
setback
in
the
german
company
s
efforts

move
on
from
a
scandal

it
admitted
to
cheating
emissions

checking
a

issued
by
vw
on
about
three
months
after
its
dieselgate
scandal
broke
in
the
united
states
over
suspicions
its
contents
were
incorrect
in
that
statement
vw
said
its
own
investigations
found
it
had
understated
fuel
consumption
and
hence
carbon
dioxide
emissions
on
no
more
than
vehicles
that
was
much
lower
than
its
preliminary
estimate
of
around
diesel
and
gasoline
vehicles
produced
five
weeks
earlier
which
caused
vw
to
warn
it
could
face
a
billion
euro
billion
hit
to
profits
from
the
disclosure
vw
also
said
in
its

unlawful
