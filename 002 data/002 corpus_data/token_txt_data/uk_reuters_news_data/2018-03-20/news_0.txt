trump
and
the
crown
prince
praised
the
strength
of
ties
which
had
grown
strained
under
the
obama
administration
in
part
over
differing
views
towards
riyadh
s
regional
rival
iran
not
so
with
trump
who
has
taken
a
hardline
view
against
iran
similar
to
that
of
the
saudi
crown
prince
who
has
compared
iran
s
supreme
leader
to
adolf
hitler
the
talks
were

trump
s
treatment
highlighted
his
administration
s
strong
backing
of
the
crown
prince
who
carried
out
an
purge
that
consolidated
his
power
and
whose
aggressive
foreign
policy
has
caused
unease
among
some
western
allies
at
the
same
time
the
kingdom
has
seen
a
cautious
new
climate
of
social
freedoms
with
the
rise
of
the
crown
prince
after
decades
of
elderly
rulers
trump
and

of
saudi
purchases
of
military
hardware
ranging
from
ships
to
missile
defence
to
planes
and
fighting
vehicles
saudi
arabia
is
a
very
wealthy
nation
and
they
re
going
to
give
the
united
states
some
of
that
wealth
hopefully
in

and
civilian
casualties
the

is
fighting
to
counter
the
influence
of
iran
an
ally
of
the
houthi

from
tehran
and
says
it
is
fighting
a
revolution
against
corrupt
politicians
and
gulf
powers
in
thrall
to
the
west
a
senior
trump
administration
official
said
the
two
leaders
talked
about
the
humanitarian
situation
in
yemen
and
that
civilian
casualties
did
not
come
up
in
a
major
way
given
that
washington
had
been
working
with
the
saudis
to
minimize
them
they
also
discussed

cooperation
riyadh
has
been
stepping
up
plans

nuclear
energy
capability
as
part
of
a
plan
to
reduce
its

discussed
with
members
countering
the

posed
by

and
the
houthi
militias
as
well
as
saudi
efforts
to
address
and
alleviate

capped
his
rapid
rise
to
power
last

cousin
prince
mohammed
bin

who
had
close
relationships
with

special
man
he
said

for
seeking
to
ease
saudi
arabia

reliance
on
oil
tackle
chronic
corruption

and
secrecy
of

november
unnerved
some
in
the
west
the
crown
prince
in
a
rare
foray
into
speaking
english
said
on
tuesday
the
saudi
pledge
for
billion
in
investments
would
end
up
at
billion
when
fully
implemented
he
said
a
window
for
implementing
the
deal
was
under
way
a
key
focus
of
his
visit
will
be
any
information
on
a
potentially
lucrative
listing
of
up
to
percent
of
saudi
oil
firm
aramco
the
new
york
stock
exchange
is
among
the
possible
venues
for
the
listing

deal
a
flawed
agreement
and
trump
has
made
clear
he
plans
to
exit
the
agreement
unless
changes
are
made
to
it
but
iran
has
not
been
treating
that
part
of
the
world
or
the
world
itself
appropriately
he
said
the
deal
is
coming
up
in
one
month
and
we
ll
see
what
the
prince
was
also

efforts
