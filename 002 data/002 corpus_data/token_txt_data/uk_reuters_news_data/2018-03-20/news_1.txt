use
percent
renewable
energy
it
said
on
tuesday
part
of
a
growing
nationwide
trend
of
schools
going
green
the
move
by
the
university
of
hawaii
campus
on
maui
island
is
and
makes
economic
sense
given
the
cost
of
fuel
on
the
remote
pacific
archipelago
of
islands
and
atolls
said
michael
unebasmi

such
as
hampshire

massachusetts
and
the
university
of

main
durham

the
decision
puts
maui
college
at
the
leading
edge
unebasmi
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
we
thought
by
doing
this
it
would
be
a
great
example
he
said
the
network
of
solar
panels
will
fuel
the
needs
of
the
hectares
grounds
by
he
said
with
a
reliance
on
fossil
fuels
hawaii
has
particularly
high
energy
prices
of
more
than
twice
the
national
average
according
to
energy
information
administration
data
the
push
by
schools
moving
away
from
polluting
sources
of
electricity
has
picked
up
pace
said
bronte
payne
at
the
environment
america
about
half
a
dozen
colleges
and
universities
have
announced
commitments
over
the
last
two
years
to
use
renewable
energy
sources
rather
than
fossil
fuel
she
told
the
foundation
largest
among
them
are
boston
university
colorado
state
university
and
cornell
university
she
said
more
than
other
colleges
and
universities
are
aiming
for
carbon
neutrality
offsetting
the
use
of
fossil
fuel
with
renewable
energy
or
carbon
credits
from
producers
of
greenhouse
gases
they
will
set
an
example
for
communities
across
the
country
she
said
cornell
in
western
new
york
state
aims
to
replace
its
natural

sustainability
office
the
main
campus
in
ithaca
with
some
students
stretches
across
acres
hectares
we
re
at
the
scale
of
a
small
city
so
it
s
a
good
place
for
us
not
only
to
discover
solutions
that
might
work
but
also
try
them
on
our
own
campus
