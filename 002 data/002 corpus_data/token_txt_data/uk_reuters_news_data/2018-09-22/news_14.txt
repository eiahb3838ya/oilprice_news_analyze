berlin
reuters
the
german
environment
agency
uba
said
on
saturday
it
was
doubtful
about
the
environmental
benefits
of
introducing
incentives
for
drivers
of
older
diesel
vehicles
to
trade
them
in
for
newer
models
chancellor
angela
merkel
is
due
to
hold
a
meeting
on
sunday
to
discuss
whether
to
require
the
car
industry
to
carry
out
costly
hardware
upgrades
for
older
diesel
vehicles
to
reduce
pollution
government
sources
said
on
friday
transport
minister
andreas
scheuer
a
member
of
merkel
s
bavarian
csu
allies
favours
incentives
to
exchange
older
vehicles
for
newer
ones
to
reduce
overall
pollution
caused
by
the
fleet
of
cars
on
the
road
and
to
avoid
driving
bans
but
frankfurter
allgemeine
newspaper
cited
an
internal
paper
from
uba
as
saying
that
in
the
best
case
scenario
such
an
exchange
premium
would
only
reduce
nitrogen
oxide
pollution
by
micrograms
per
cubic
meter
that
would
be
a
very
small
amount
compared
with
the
overall
pollution
which
is
at
between
and
micrograms
in
cities
like
stuttgart
or
munich
the
newspaper
cited
uba
as
saying
a
spokesman
for
uba
which
is
germany
s
main
environmental
protection
agency
confirmed
that
the
newspaper
report
was
accurate
it
would
be
better
to
make
retrofits
mandatory
he
said
meaning
carmakers
would
build
in
selective
catalytic
reduction
scr
systems
he
added
that
this
was
the
only
way
to
avoid
driving
bans
older
diesel
vehicles
such
as
those
of
the
standard
sometimes
have
lower
emissions
than
the
more
modern
standard
diesel
vehicles
scheuer
has
not
ruled
out
the
possibility
of
a
retrofit
with
catalysts
which
is
favoured
by
the
environment
ministry
run
by
the
social
democrats
but
he
considers
that
solution
to
be
more
complicated
technically
and
more
expensive
merkel
has
tasked
scheuer
with
finding
a
solution
to
make
older
diesel
cars
cleaner
and
to
avoid
bans
on
diesel
cars
the
car
industry
has
lobbied
against
equipping
old
diesel
models
with
extra
emissions
control
technology
because
that
could
cost
billions
of
euros
