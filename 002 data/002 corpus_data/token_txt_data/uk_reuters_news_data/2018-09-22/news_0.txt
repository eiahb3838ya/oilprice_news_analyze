update 3-opec and allies struggle to pump more oil as iran supply falls
algiers
reuters
opec
and
its
allies
reduced
oil
output
in
august
as
a
drop
in
iranian
supply
due
to
sanctions
derailed
their
attempts
to
raise
production
to
agreed
levels
delegates
said
on
saturday
as
the
energy
producers
prepared
to
hold
talks
in
algiers
the
development
further
raises
pressure
on
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
to
boost
supply
amid
calls
from
president
donald
trump
to
lower
oil
prices
on
friday
a
source
familiar
with
the
discussions
told
reuters
opec
and
its
allies
led
by
russia
were
considering
the
possibility
of
raising
crude
supplies
by
a
further
barrels
per
day
bpd
as
sanctions
on
opec
s
producer
iran
bite
into
tehran
s
exports
if
an
increase
in
production
is
proposed
there
will
be
plenty
of
market
that
it
reduces
even
further
the
available
spare
capacity
olivier
jakob
from
consultancy
petromatrix
said
saudi
arabia
has
made
the
mistake
of
trying
to
compensate
for
the
loss
of
iranian
supplies
with
replacement
but
the
oil
market
is
looking
for
greater
supply
security
than
that
as
a
result
the
strength
of
oil
prices
is
now
putting
oil
demand
growth
at
risk
he
added
an
opec
and
monitoring
committee
gathering
in
the
algerian
capital
this
weekend
found
that
oil
producers
compliance
with
a
agreement
reached
percent
in
august
two
committee
delegates
said
this
compares
with
a
compliance
level
of
percent
for
july
indicating
that
the
group
went
beyond
its
agreed
cut
oman
s
oil
minister
mohammed
bin
hamad
told
reporters
on
saturday
that
opec
and
producers
overachieved
on
pledged
output
cuts
by
bpd
in
august
putting
the
reduction
at
around
million
bpd
seeking
to
reverse
a
downturn
in
oil
prices
that
began
in
opec
russia
and
other
allies
decided
in
late
to
reduce
supply
by
some
million
bpd
in
june
this
year
however
after
months
of
cutting
by
more
than
their
pact
had
called
for
amid
involuntary
reductions
from
venezuela
and
other
producers
they
agreed
to
boost
output
by
returning
to
percent
compliance
that
equates
to
an
increase
of
about
million
bpd
but
the
latest
figures
show
they
are
some
way
from
achieving
that
target
oil
reached
a
barrel
this
month
prompting
trump
to
demand
again
that
opec
bring
down
prices
we
protect
the
countries
of
the
middle
east
they
would
not
be
safe
for
very
long
without
us
and
yet
they
continue
to
push
for
higher
and
higher
oil
prices
we
will
remember
the
opec
monopoly
must
get
prices
down
now
he
wrote
on
twitter
higher
gasoline
prices
for
consumers
could
create
a
political
headache
for
trump
before
november
congressional
elections
opec
sources
said
any
official
action
to
raise
output
would
require
opec
to
hold
what
it
calls
an
extraordinary
meeting
a
proposal
that
is
not
on
the
table
yet
but
the
joint
opec
and
ministerial
committee
known
as
the
jmmc
which
meets
on
sunday
can
still
recommend
a
further
increase
in
output
if
needed
