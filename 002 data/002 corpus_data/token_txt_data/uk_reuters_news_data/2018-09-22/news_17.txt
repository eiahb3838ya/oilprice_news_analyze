s
national
oil
corporation
noc
said
on
saturday
its

the
arabian
gulf
oil
company
agoco
had
restored

at
barrels
of
oil
per
day
bpd
at
an
abandoned

in
the

after
years
of
inactivity

resumed
at
the
well
using
the
latest
drilling
techniques
developed
by

services
company
schlumberger
the
noc
said
in
a
statement
the
north
african
country
was
producing
more
than
million
bpd
before
a
uprising
that
toppled
muammar
gaddafi
and
led
to
political
fragmentation
and
armed
conflict
messla
s
output
was
around
bpd
since
libya
has
been
divided
between
rival
governments
and
military
factions
based
in
the
east
and
west
of
the
country
causing
political
deadlock
and
an
economic
crisis
however
the
noc
has
continued
to
function
relatively
normally
across
libya
which
relies
on
oil
exports
for
most
of
its
income
output
has
been
hit
by
attacks
on
oil
facilities
and
blockades
though
last
year
it
partially
recovered
to
around
one
million
barrels
per
day
earlier
this
month
the
noc
suffered
a
shooting
attack
on
its
tripoli
headquarters
claimed
by
islamic
state
militants
that
killed
two
people
and
wounded
but
it
continued
to
manage
its
operations
as
normal
it
said
along
with
the
central
bank
the
noc
is
one
of
the
only
state
enterprises
still
functioning
well
despite
the
conflict
