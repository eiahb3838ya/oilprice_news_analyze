its
total
installed
nuclear
capacity
to
gigawatts
gw
by
the
end
of
up
from
gw
at
the
end
of
june
this
year
but
it
also
has
ambitions
to
dominate
the
global
market
and
has
created
a
unified
reactor
brand
known
as
the
hualong
one
to
sell
overseas
china
has
already
signed
a
series
of
preliminary
agreements
with
countries
like

it
calls
for
the
establishment
of
a

members
of
the

are
invited
to
submit
their
opinions

before
china
was
once
regarded
as
one
of
the
bright
spots
for
the
global
nuclear
sector
but
its
ambitious
domestic
reactor
building
program
has
slowed
considerably
with
no
new
projects
approved
since
in
a
bid
to
guarantee
safety
in
the
wake
of
japan
s
fukushima
disaster
in
china
promised
to
deploy
only
new
and
safer
reactor
technology
including
westinghouse
s
and
the
epr
designed
by
france
s
areva
but
the
untested
models
have
been
repeatedly
delayed
amid
design
flaws
and
huge
cost
overruns
and
beijing
is
now
expected
to
struggle
to
meet
its
gw
target
