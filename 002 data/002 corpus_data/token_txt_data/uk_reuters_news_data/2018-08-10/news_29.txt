iea says calm in oil markets could be short-lived
moscow
reuters
oil
markets
have
entered
a
brief
period
of
calm
but
a
storm
might
be
looming
later
this
year
when
new
sanctions
are
poised
to
slash
supplies
of
iranian
oil
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
friday
the
recent
cooling
down
of
the
market
with
supply
tensions
easing
currently
lower
prices
and
lower
demand
growth
might
not
last
the
iea
which
oversees
the
energy
policies
of
industrialized
nations
said
in
a
monthly
report
oil
prices
have
rallied
close
to
per
barrel
their
highest
since
on
concerns
about
supply
shortages
but
cooled
in
recent
weeks
as
libya
regained
some
lost
production
and
washington
signaled
it
could
give
asian
buyers
of
iranian
oil
some
exemptions
from
sanctions
for
next
year
however
the
united
states
said
it
was
still
seeking
to
force
iran
s
oil
customers
to
stop
purchases
completely
in
the
long
run
iran
is
opec
s
producer
with
output
at
around
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
or
percent
of
global
supply
as
oil
sanctions
against
iran
take
effect
perhaps
in
combination
with
production
problems
elsewhere
maintaining
global
supply
might
be
very
challenging
and
would
come
at
the
expense
of
maintaining
an
adequate
spare
capacity
cushion
the
iea
said
saudi
arabia
iran
s
and
a
close
ally
of
washington
has
pledged
intervention
to
prevent
any
supply
shortage
saudi
arabia
is
producing
around
million
bpd
and
could
in
theory
raise
output
to
above
million
bpd
but
such
a
move
would
leave
the
world
with
virtually
no
spare
capacity
to
cushion
against
possible
supply
disruptions
in
producer
countries
like
libya
venezuela
or
nigeria
thus
the
market
outlook
could
be
far
less
calm
at
that
point
than
it
is
today
the
iea
said
besides
supply
fears
oil
prices
are
being
supported
by
healthy
demand
growth
that
has
repeatedly
surprised
on
the
upside
in
recent
years
despite
a
recovery
in
prices
the
iea
kept
its
oil
demand
growth
forecast
unchanged
at
million
bpd
but
raised
its
forecast
by
around
bpd
to
million
bpd
another
factor
to
consider
is
that
trade
tensions
might
escalate
and
lead
to
slower
economic
growth
and
in
turn
lower
oil
demand
the
iea
said
referring
to
a
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
