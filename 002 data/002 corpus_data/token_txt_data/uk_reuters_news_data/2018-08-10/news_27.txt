a
huge
oil
refinery
being
built
in
nigeria
by
africa
s
richest
man
is
unlikely
to
start
production
until
two
years
later
than
the

date

knowledge
of
the
matter
said
the

refinery
near
lagos
set
to
be
africa
s
biggest
is
expected
to
boost
nigeria
s
growth
and
turn
the
country
from
an
importer
of
refined
products
into
an
exporter
transforming
global
trade
patterns
billionaire
aliko
dangote
who
built
his
fortune
on
cement
told
reuters
last
month
he
hoped
to
finish
building
the
refinery
in
and
to
start
production
in
early
however
the
sources
who
have
been
on
the
site
many
times
said
they
do
not
expect
gasoline
or
diesel
output
before
early
and
even
then
many
units
at
the
refinery
and
accompanying
petrochemical
plant
would
not
be
complete

devakumar
edwin
who
oversees
the
project
described
the
suggestion
that
the
refinery
is
unlikely
to
start
production
until
as
the
product
of
someone

wild
imagination

has
been

percent
of

we
started
civil
works
in
july
last
year
and
we
have
scheduled
years
for
mechanical
completion

said
referring
to
the
point
where
a
plant
is
ready
to
be
handed
over
for
commissioning
dangote
who
expects
the
project
to
cost
billion
said
in
july
he
has
raised
more
than
billion
i
ve
never
seen
a
refinery
of
that
scale
built
in
two
years
it
s
highly
improbable
due
to
the
sequence
of
events
that
need
to
happen
it
can
not
be
safely
a
source
advising
the
nigerian
government
said
the
sources
said
a
refinery
on
such
a
scale
would
likely
need
five
years
to
complete
and
the
piling
underpinning
the
plant
had
only
started
in
the
second
half
of
last
year
and
would
take
some
more
months
to
complete
extra
piling
was
needed
to
support
the
plant
s
units
in
the
swampy
area
causing
an
unforeseen
delay
the
sources
said
analysts
also
anticipate
delays
owing
to
the
scale
of
the
project
in
an
area
with
limited
infrastructure
in
our
forecast
we
are
putting
late
at
the
earliest
for
some
gasoline
production
but
it
may
slip

energy
fuel
shortages
are
common
in
nigeria
despite
the
country
of
million
people
being
africa
s
biggest
oil
producer
the
existing
bpd
refining
system
operates
well
below
capacity
due
to
corruption
and
lack
of
investment
leaving
the
state

firm
to
import
the
bulk
of
its
gasoline
and
gasoil
needs
paid
for
with
cargoes
of
crude
oil
edwin
told
reuters
last
month
that
more
than
half
the
plant
s
output
could
be
exported
after
covering
domestic
needs
the
plant
will
be
the
world
s
largest
refinery
meaning
it
will
have
only
one
crude
distillation
unit
cdu
the
government
adviser
said
the
cdu
would
not
be
ready
for
commissioning
until
the
third
or
fourth
quarter
of
at
the
earliest
and
that
process
would
take
about
six
months
major
pieces
of
equipment
have
yet
to
arrive
or
are
still
being
constructed
overseas
a
lack
of
infrastructure
to
transport
and
install
oversized
equipment
and
risks
from
rainy
season
storms
could
add
unforeseen
delays
the
government
adviser
said
the
refinery
project
was
first
announced
in
as
a
smaller
plant
to
be
finished
in
a
site
move
to
lekki
in
lagos
state
and
a
currency
crisis
caused
initial
delays
the
first
producing
unit
of
the
fertilizer
plant
at
the
same
site
is
complete
but
the
pipeline
that
was
supposed
to
bring
its
key
input
natural
gas
is
not
finished
meaning
that
the
start
would
also
be
missed
