i

on

escalating
trade
disputes
between
the
china
and
other
countries
have
dimmed
the
outlook
for
economic
growth
and
boosted
the
dollar
making

despite
these
worries
prices
got
a
boost
from
sanctions
against
iran
which
from
november
will
affect
oil
exports
from
that
country
although
the
european
union
china
and
india
oppose
the
sanctions
against
iran
many
are
expected
to
bow
to
pressure
analysts
expect
iranian
crude
exports
to
fall
by
between
and
million
barrels
per
day
with

and
india
already
dialing

the

will
depend
on
whether

of

receive
waivers

would
allow
some

the
international
energy
agency
said
on

investors
are
wary

dispute
between

china
said
it
would
impose
additional

oil
was
removed
from
