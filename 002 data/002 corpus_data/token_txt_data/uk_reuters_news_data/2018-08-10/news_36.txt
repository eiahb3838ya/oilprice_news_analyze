never
considered
that
golden
fields
of
sorghum
or
indeed
any
crop
might
one
day
flourish
on
the
outskirts
of
his
village
in
turkana
county
from
the
time
i
was
a
small
herdsboy
in
this
community
i
never
imagined
the
possibility
of
farming
in
this
area
given
the
tough
climate
and
our
nomadic
lifestyle
said
pedo
the
fields
that
have
sprung
up
in
this
vast
and
arid
scrubland
in
kenya
s
northwest
are
in
part
due
to
the
hard
work
of
refugees
who
have
come
here
from
neighbouring
south
sudan
ethiopia
and
uganda
in
recent
decades
turkana
is
kenya
s
county
and
its
poorest
yet
in
it
donated
hectares
acres
of
land
for
the
refugee
settlement
of
about
people
near
pedo
s
village
of
kalobeyei
the
idea
was
to
develop
an
agricultural
project
that
would
help
bring
together
the
new
arrivals
and
locals
residents
and
refugees
alike
say
it
has
worked
well
apart
from
seeing
our
people
marry
some
of
the
refugees
they
also
guide
us
a
lot
when
it
comes
to
farming
because
some
of
them
came
from
communities
that
depended
on
agriculture
said
nomadic
pastoralist
jeremiah
kazimoto
namuzungu
berta
a
refugee
from
the
democratic
republic
of
congo
said
it
was
liberating
for
refugees
to
grow
their
own
food
and
earn
an
income
instead
of
relying
on
aid
with
this
arrangement
we
now
have
the
freedom
to
choose
what
to
eat
because
we
can
either
grow
it
or
buy
from
the
community
said
berta
the
project
began
as
kitchen
gardens
in
but
today
it
includes
hectares
of
sorghum
a
cereal
with
large
fields
subdivided
between
refugees
and
the
local
community
which
both
harvest
and
earn
money
from
the
crop
when
the
sorghum
ripens
the
farmers
sell
it
to
aid
agencies
which
grind
it
and
use
it
to
feed
the
refugees
i
harvested
seven
bags
of
sorghum
from
my
piece
of
land
and
i
sold
four
of
them
to
the
red
cross
at
a
premium
price
of
kenyan
shillings
for
a
bag
said
jackson
akure
sokona
a
resident
from
nearby
kolioro
village
the
kitchen
gardens
and
the
more
recent
sorghum
crop
were
part
of
a
million
euro
million
development
project
for
the
area
funded
by
the
european
union
emergency
trust
fund
for
africa
and
implemented
by
the
local
authorities
and
the
united
nation
s
food
and
agriculture
organization
fao
the
project
which
ends
in
aims
to
provide
refugees
with
sustainable
livelihoods
through
agriculture
while
helping
them
integrate
with
their
host
community
it
is
the
first
of
its
kind
in
kenya
officials
said
due
to
prolonged
political
instability
in
some
neighbouring
countries
refugees
are
almost
permanent
here
so
it
makes
sense
to
allow
them
to
generate
an
income
alongside
the
host
community
said
gabriel
rugalema
from
the
fao
in
kenya
when
you
allow
them
to
mingle
and
work
together
they
get
used
to
each
other
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
kenya
continues
to
experience
an
influx
of
refugees
the
fao
said
which
reinforces
the
need
to
help
them
become
economically
and
less
dependent
on
aid
local
authorities
say
they
also
hope
to
avoid
complications
encountered
in
at
kakuma
camp
some
kilometres
away
where
the
host
community
felt
they
did
not
benefit
from
the
refugees
presence
the
goal
at
kalobeyei
is
for
the
local
community
of
about
people
to
take
over
the
refugees
farms
if
and
when
they
go
home
allowing
the
area
to
remain
productive
food
security
is
one
of
our
priorities
and
if
the
refugees
can
work
alongside
our
communities
to
produce
food
locally
then
we
must
support
such
an
initiative
turkana
deputy
governor
peter
emuria
lotethiro
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
turkana
s
low
rainfall
makes
farming
here
challenging
the
area
is
sorely
in
need
of
rainwater
harvesting
techniques
such
as
sand
dams
and
underground
water
tanks
in
addition
its
soils
and
water
are
saline
and
struggle
to
support
agriculture
which
is
why
most
local
people
keep
livestock
mainly
sheep
and
goats
but
technologies
like
farming
and
irrigation
have
enabled
them
to
use
stored
rainwater
to
cultivate
crops
we
are
using
proven
rainwater
harvesting
techniques
to
capitalise
on
perennial
floods
in
this
area
whenever
it
rains
said
zippy
mbati
a
programme
officer
at
the
world
food
programme
community
members
who
take
part
in
the
farming
project
are
trained
to
plant
sorghum
using
a
method
in
which
a
sand
barrier
is
built
in
front
of
the
growing
area
capturing
rainwater
and
releasing
it
slowly
the
fao
said
work
is
underway
to
expand
the
area
under
cultivation
the
turkana
government
and
the
fao
are
due
to
set
up
an
irrigation
system
on
a
piece
of
land
set
aside
for
farming
in
kalobeyei
said
fao
field
officer
michael
ngututo
this
will
give
people
enough
land
to
produce
about
metric
tonnes
of
food
worth
million
kenyan
shillings
ngututo
said
meantime
refugees
who
have
made
this
arid
part
of
kenya
home
said
they
were
glad
of
the
difference
the
project
has
made
to
their
lives
as
a
refugee
it
is
very
exciting
that
i
am
able
to
grow
and
feed
my
children
on
fresh
vegetables
said
hellen
chebachoge
who
was
relocated
here
from
dadaab
refugee
camp
in
northeast
kenya
earlier
this
year
i
came
from
a
farming
community
in
uganda
and
so
having
a
kitchen
garden
makes
me
