energy execs lament trump tariffs as costs rise on pipeline projects
houston
reuters
president
donald
trump
s
proposal
to
double
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminum
from
turkey
could
push
up
costs
even
further
for
domestic
oil
and
gas
pipeline
projects
as
energy
executives
said
they
were
already
struggling
from
earlier
tariff
rises
there
are
more
than
a
dozen
energy
pipelines
on
the
drawing
board
some
of
which
are
still
seeking
financing
the
projects
would
pave
the
way
for
greater
oil
and
gas
exports
and
relieve
a
bottleneck
in
west
texas
shale
fields
that
is
starting
to
pinch
output
in
the
region
turkey
delivers
just
percent
of
steel
mill
imports
valued
about
billion
last
year
according
to
the
department
of
commerce
but
doubling
tariffs
on
a
supplier
could
force
buyers
to
turn
to
other
steel
makers
and
in
turn
lift
steel
prices
that
have
already
ballooned
in
recent
months
on
friday
trump
authorized
a
doubling
of
tariffs
on
turkish
steel
and
aluminum
imports
to
percent
and
percent
respectively
ratcheting
up
a
diplomatic
dispute
with
the
country
the
trump
administration
s
original
move
in
march
to
raise
tariffs
on
most
steel
and
aluminum
imports
was
proposed
to
safeguard
jobs
against
overseas
rivals
that
had
already
added
million
to
the
cost
of
a
plains
all
american
crude
oil
pipeline
that
will
use
steel
supplied
by
a
greek
company
plains
executives
said
we
are
moving
forward
with
the
project
but
believe
that
imposing
a
tax
on
orders
is
unjust
especially
considering
the
specific
materials
we
purchased
abroad
were
not
readily
available
in
the
willie
chiang
plains
chief
operating
officer
said
on
tuesday
the
trade
actions
threaten
important
energy
infrastructure
projects
said
catherine
landry
a
vice

at

group
interstate
natural

companies
were
being
unfairly
punished
for
participating
in

the
second
largest
north
american
pipeline
operator
had
already
ordered
nearly
half
of
the
specialized
pipe
needed
for
its
gulf
coast
express
project
from
turkish
steel
maker
borusan
mannesmann
before
the
original
tariff
went
into
effect
spokeswoman
sara
hughes
said
the

on
friday
declined
to
comment
on
the
impact
on
the
project
of
the
doubling
of
the
tariff
the
billion
gulf
coast
express
is
a
natural

being
constructed

texas
to

kinder
morgan
had
applied
to
the
commerce
department
for
an
exemption
to
the
original
percent
tariff
but
had
not
yet
received
a
decision
the
spokeswoman
added
alan
madison
a
spokesman
for
borusan
mannesmann
s
subsidiary
said
the
company
and
its
turkish
parent
were
still
studying
trump
s
new
proposal
and
declined
to
comment
further
the
turkish
currency
fell
more
than
percent
on
friday
increasing
its
costs
to
import
raw
materials
but
making
exports
relatively
cheaper
the
turks
can
export
to
many
other
countries
but
with
a
weak
lira
their
products
become
cheaper
to
buy
the
cheap
lira
actually
can
help
increase
their
export
volume
