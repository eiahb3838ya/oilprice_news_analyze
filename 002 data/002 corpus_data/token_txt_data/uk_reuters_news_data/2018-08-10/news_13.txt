update 1-russia loses bulk of wto challenge to eu gas pipeline rules
geneva
reuters
russia
largely
failed
in
its
bid
to
overturn
the
european
union
s
gas
market
rules
in
a
world
trade
organization
ruling
published
on
friday
russia
launched
the
dispute
in
claiming
that
the
eu
s
third
energy
package
and
the
eu
s
energy
policy
overall
unfairly
restricted
and
discriminated
against
russia
s
gas
export
monopoly
gazprom
russia
argued
that
the
eu
broke
wto
rules
by
requiring
the
unbundling
of
gas
transmission
assets
and
production
and
supply
assets
which
effectively
stopped
gazprom
long
the
major
supplier
of
gas
to
europe
from
owning
the
pipelines
through
which
it
sent
gas
to
the
european
market
russia
said
the
eu
had
unfairly
discriminated
in
favour
of
liquefied
natural
gas
and
upstream
pipeline
operators
by
exempting
them
from
those
unbundling
requirements
the
panel
of
three
wto
adjudicators
ruled
against
russia
on
those
points
however
they
upheld
russia
s
complaint
about
an
unbundling
exemption
for
germany
s
opal
pipeline
granted
on
condition
that
gazprom
supplied
no
more
than
percent
of
the
gas
in
the
pipeline
the
percent
cap
could
only
be
exceeded
if
billion
cubic
metres
of
gas
was
released
annually
at
a
fixed
price
to
competing
suppliers
on
the
czech
market
the
wto
panel
also
agreed
that
croatia
hungary
and
lithuania
had
discriminated
against
russia
by
requiring
a
security
of
energy
supply
assessment
for
foreign
but
not
domestic
pipeline
operators
the
european
commission
called
the
ruling
an
important
positive
outcome
that
secured
the
core
elements
of
the
third
energy
package
a
reform
that
sought
to
integrate
the
eu
s
energy
market
while
increasing
competition
the
commission
will
now
analyse
the
ruling
in
detail
in
particular
as
regards
a
limited
number
of
issues
on
which
the
of
eu
energy
policy
has
still
not
been
recognised
it
said
in
a
statement
russia
s
economy
ministry
said
the
parts
of
the
ruling
that
went
in
its
favour
would
help
to
improve
access
for
russian
gas
on
the
european
market
and
to
level
the
playing
field
for
pipeline
service
providers
this
is
a
positive
precedent
that
makes
it
possible
to
change
the
norms
that
created
obstacles
for
russian
suppliers
in
the
eu
market
both
in
eu
legislation
and
in
the
legislation
of
its
individual
member
countries
it
said
in
a
statement
gazprom
said
it
had
always
said
that
european
energy
policy
should
take
gas
suppliers
interests
into
account
and
therefore
it
was
satisfied
with
the
points
where
russia
had
won
either
side
can
appeal
within
days
