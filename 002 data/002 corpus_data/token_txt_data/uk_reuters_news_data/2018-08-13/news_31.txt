algiers
reuters
the
head
of
algerian
state
oil
firm
sonatrach
has
assembled
a
new
leadership
team
a
senior
company
source
said
aiming
to
reverse
a
flow
of
talent
from
an
unwieldy
state
enterprise
that
keeps
the
country
afloat
president
abdelaziz
bouteflika
put
abdelmoumen
ould
kaddour
in
charge
of
overhauling
sonatrach
in
march
after
years
of
ceos
fraud
scandals
and
red
tape
had
put
foreign
investors
off
the
north
african
opec
producer
the
oil
giant
is
an
important
source
of
energy
for
european
states
trying
to
reduce
their
dependence
on
russia
and
it
funds
a
major
part
of
the
budget
in
a
country
where
economic
security
helps
prevent
social
turbulence
jobs
at
sonatrach
are
plentiful
and
but
on
a
global
scale
pay
is
low
and
depends
on
time
served
we
have
lost
thousands
of
experienced
and
talented
people
mainly
because
we
can
t
give
them
a
salary
they
get
now
in
the
gulf
and
other
countries
kaddour
said
in
an
interview
in
his
office
in
algiers
the
ceo
who
came
with
his
own
team
to
help
win
back
the
trust
of
oil
majors
has
now
chosen
eight
vice
presidents
from
within
the
firm
the
sonatrach
source
said
declining
to
be
named
because
the
appointments
have
not
been
made
public
the
source
said
they
included
experienced
managers
such
as
salah
mekmouche
for
exploration
and
arbi
bey
slimane
for
pipe
transportation
and
what
he
said
were
rising
stars
farid
ghazali
for
strategy
and
ahmed
mazighi
on
commercial
affairs
the
appointments
still
need
to
be
validated
by
a
presidential
decree
but
the
top
managers
have
already
started
the
source
said
sonatrach
and
kaddour
were
not
immediately
available
to
comment
on
the
appointments
kaddour
aims
to
make
the
firm
one
of
the
top
five
state
oil
companies
by
in
algeria
was
ranked
in
a
energy
information
administration
list
by
output
empowering
kaddour
to
make
changes
is
part
of
efforts
by
bouteflika
an
former
independence
fighter
in
office
since
to
overcome
a
slump
in
oil
and
gas
exports
by
easing
the
grip
of
generals
on
economic
matters
annual
energy
revenues
have
halved
since
bouteflika
who
has
not
spoken
in
public
since
suffering
a
stroke
in
dismissed
four
senior
generals
in
june
including
police
chief
abdelghani
hamel
a
display
of
power
over
security
services
before
elections
next
year
it
is
part
of
a
trend
some
outsiders
have
noticed
when
you
speak
to
a
banker
or
to
an
economic
operator
now
you
can
be
sure
that
they
no
longer
have
someone
telling
them
what
to
do
as
used
to
be
the
case
when
the
old
guard
was
in
charge
a
western
diplomat
said
sonatrach
holds
the
third
biggest
shale
reserves
in
the
world
and
has
been
talking
to
exxon
mobil
and
other
firms
about
exploration
to
shore
up
energy
export
revenues
which
make
up
percent
of
total
exports
but
such
exploration
requires
specialist
skills
and
engineers
drillers
reservoir
specialists
and
others
have
left
since
said
a
manager
at
sonatrach
a
sprawling
conglomerate
with
around
workers
in
its
oil
and
gas
division
they
have
been
encouraged
by
generous
bonuses
offered
to
state
workers
who
resign
to
ease
the
burden
on
the
budget
hundreds
are
already
working
in
the
gulf
including
zahir
shikh
a
senior
reservoir
engineer
based
there
and
several
sources
said
the
exodus
had
accelerated
this
year
as
rising
crude
prices
encouraged
firms
there
and
elsewhere
to
hire
more
friends
and
colleagues
at
sonatrach
call
me
on
a
daily
basis
seeking
a
position
in
the
gulf
shikh
said
by
telephone
monthly
salaries
here
are
between
to
while
sonatrach
s
ceo
salary
is
no
more
than
kaddour
who
spent
much
of
his
career
in
the
as
well
as
energy
firms
in
the
gulf
and
africa
plans
education
and
training
via
a
sonatrach
management
academy
and
will
bring
back
retired
workers
to
coach
new
recruits
he
is
also
seeking
to
introduce
special
rewards
to
retain
bright
people
working
around
a
rigid
salary
structure
which
pays
a
bureaucrat
like
a
drilling
engineer
kaddour
fears
any
outright
wage
increase
for
engineers
might
trigger
wider
protests
after
doctors
and
teachers
went
on
strike
for
months
this
year
demanding
pay
rises
to
match
inflation
a
former
energy
minister
said
sonatrach
should
expand
its
overseas
activities
to
retain
high
performers
under
the
pay
system
such
foreign
jobs
are
paid
better
than
local
hires
sonatrach
is
present
in
its
southern
neighbour
niger
and
officials
have
said
it
is
talking
to
iraq
and
libya
about
exploration
and
development
contracts
kaddour
s
success
could
hang
on
whether
potential
recruits
think
he
can
last
in
his
post
in
a
country
where
regular
reshuffles
signal
shifts
in
a
secretive
elite
made
up
of
the
ruling
party
military
intelligence
and
tycoons
sonatrach
has
had
ten
ceos
in
the
past
ten
years
kaddour
himself
served
a
jail
term
before
he
got
the
top
job
bouteflika
is
expected
to
run
for
a
fifth
presidential
term
next
year
but
there
are
questions
over
his
health
his
last
appearance
in
april
was
the
first
in
some
time
although
allies
say
his
mind
is
sharp
and
he
remains
in
charge
