the

pared
some
of
its
losses
against
the

the
central
bank
said
it
had
lowered
reserve
requirement
ratios
for
banks
as
well
as
pledged
to
provide
whatever
liquidity
banks
needed
and
to
take
all
necessary
measures
to
maintain
financial
stability

s
a
textbook
crisis
for
many
years
everybody
said
turkey
was
a
weak
country
due
to
its
large
external
debt
and
current
account
deficit
said

strategist
at

there
is
nothing
surprising
other
than
that
the
central
bank
is
not
really
reacting
