on

while

much
of
the
early
action
was
in
currencies
with
the
euro
gapping
lower
as
the
turkish
lira
took
another
slide
to
lows
around
at
one
stage
it
was
last
at
having
found
just
a
sliver
of
support
when
turkish
finance
minister
berat
albayrak
said
the
country
had
drafted
an
action
plan
to
ease
investor
concerns
and
the
banking
watchdog
said
it
limited
swap
transactions
the
currency
tumbled
more
than
percent
this
year
on
worries
over
turkish
president
tayyip
erdogan
s
increasing
control
over
the
economy
and
deteriorating
relations
with
the
united
states
the
plunge
in
the
lira
which
began
in
may
now
looks
certain
to
push
the
turkish
economy
into
recession
and
it
may
well
trigger
a
banking
crisis
said
andrew
kenningham
chief
global
economist
at
capital
economics
this
would
be
another
blow
for
ems
as
an
asset
class
but
the
wider
economic
spillovers
should
be
fairly
modest
even
for
the
euro
zone
he
added
kenningham
noted
turkey
s
annual
gross
domestic
product
of
around
billion
was
just
percent
of
the
global
economy
and
slightly
smaller
than
the
netherlands
the
turkish
equity
market
was
less
than
percent
of
the
size
of
the
uk
market
and
only
percent
was
held
by
he
added
nonetheless
turkey
s
troubles
are
a
further
headwind
for
the
euro
and
are
not
good
news
for
em
assets
indeed
the
single
currency
sank
to
a
trough
against
the
swiss
franc
in
early
trade
around
francs
while
hitting
a
low
on
the
yen
around
against
the
dollar
the
euro
touched
its
lowest
since
july
at
it
was
last
at
and
still
a
long
way
from
last

s
top

the

against
the
safe

but
was
a
shade
firmer
against
a
basket
of
currencies
at
the
argentine
peso
and
south
african
rand
were
also
caught
in
the
crossfire
contagion
risks
centre
on
spanish
italian
and
french
banks
exposed
to
turkish
foreign
currency
debt
as
well
as
argentina
and
south
africa
warned
analysts
at
anz
turkey
s
massive
pile
of
corporate
debt
denominated
in
foreign
currencies
but
a
rapidly
sliding
currency
and
inflation
that
s
threatening
to
go
exponential
is
a
toxic
in

markets

found
