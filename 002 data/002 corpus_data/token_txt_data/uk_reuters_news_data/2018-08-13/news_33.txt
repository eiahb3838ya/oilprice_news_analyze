update 2-australia's apa backs $9.5 bln bid from hong kong's cki as regulatory jitters cap shares
reuters
the
board
of
australia
s
apa
group
has
recommended
shareholders
vote
for
a
a
billion
billion
takeover
offer
from
a
consortium
led
by
hong
kong
s
ck
infrastructure
holdings
ltd
cki
at
a
meeting
in
late
november
while
analysts
expect
shareholders
to
approve
the
deal
apa
s
stock
was
broadly
flat
after
the
announcement
trading
around
percent
below
the
a
offer
price
on
concern
the
regulators
may
block
the
deal
due
to
rising
gas
prices
cki
is
satisfied
with
its
prospects
of
obtaining
clearance
and
we
are
comfortable
with
the
prospects
of
gaining
approvals
based
on
the
information
available
to
us
apa
chairman
michael
fraser
told
reporters
on
a
conference
call
on
monday
the
deal
would
make
cki
part
of
an
empire
founded
by
hong
kong
tycoon
li
the
biggest
gas
pipeline
player
on
australia
s
east
coast
giving
it
more
pricing
power
in
a
market
where
gas
prices
are
so
high
the
issue
has
become
political
gas
prices
have
soared
since
the
opening
of
three
liquefied
natural
gas
export
plants
on
the
east
coast
sucking
gas
out
of
the
domestic
market
a
consequent
rise
in
utility
bills
has
become
a
sore
point
for
voters
leaving
the
government
trying
to
win
approval
for
an
energy
policy
aimed
at
bringing
prices
down
cki
in
a
separate
statement
on
monday
said
it
is
seeking
approval
from
the
australian
competition
and
consumer
commission
accc
as
well
as
the
foreign
investment
review
board
which
is
being
advised
by
the
critical
infrastructure
centre
cki
is
strongly
supportive
of
the
australian
government
s
energy
policy
objectives
particularly
as
they
relate
to
the
availability
reliability
and
affordability
of
energy
for
australian
businesses
and
consumers
said
cki
deputy
managing
director
andy
hunter
the
recommendation
comes
after
cki
conducted
nearly
two
months
of
due
diligence
without
changing
its
offer
made
in
june
that
was
percent
above
apa
s
share
price
on
the
eve
of
the
offer
and
led
apa
to
open
its
books
to
the
consortium
which
includes
ck
asset
holdings
ltd
and
power
assets
holdings
ltd
we
think
the
offer
s
broadly
fair
but
we
re
waiting
for
the
accc
and
critical
infrastructure
review
said
nick
langley
executive
of
rare
infrastructure
apa
s
shareholder
last
year
cki
received
approval
for
a
a
billion
takeover
of
pipeline
owner
duet
group
to
minimise
competition
concern
for
the
apa
deal
it
has
offered
to
divest
all
of
apa
s
pipeline
assets
in
western
australia
where
it
has
owned
the
gas
pipeline
since
the
duet
takeover
the
competition
watchdog
began
reviewing
the
deal
in
june
and
aims
to
announce
a
decision
or
concerns
on
these
bids
are
expensive
so
you
wouldn
t
be
frivolous
with
your
capital
unless
you
were
reasonably
confident
of
finding
a
way
through
langley
said
having
said
that
apa
is
trading
a
long
way
below
the
terms
of
the
deal
so
the
market
obviously
has
a
different
