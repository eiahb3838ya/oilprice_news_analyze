were
knocked

in

with
the

already
dented
by

pared
some
of

said
it
had
lowered

ratios
for

it
also
said
it
would
provide
whatever
liquidity
banks
needed
and
take
all
necessary

to
maintain

however
the

was
still
down
more
than
percent

slid
to
an

while
the

rupiah
hit
its

in
almost
three
years
prompting

from
the
country
s
central

the
wave
of
selling
was
triggered
on
friday
when
president
donald
trump
announced
tougher
sanctions
on
turkish
steel
and
aluminium
exports
causing

russian

also
felt
the
heat
last
week
after
surprise
sanctions
by
washington
it
is
premature
to
conclude
how
long
and
how
much
the
impact
will
expand
said
kim
economist
at

securities
i
expect
emerging
countries
which
have
a
thorny
relationship
with
trump
administration
could
be
the
first
ones
to
suffer
from
capital

will
cause
some

index
was
near

the
japanese
yen
climbed
for
a
second
straight
day
to
a
month
top
however
the
is
not

to
emerging

the

stumbled
to
more
than

had
fallen

index
was
down

some
analysts
expect
asia
to
ride
out
the
storm
thanks
to
ample
foreign
exchange
reserves
and
prudent
fiscal
and
monetary
policies
while
others
see
the
current
turmoil
as
an
opportunity
to
pick
up
cheap
assets
asia
should
not
see

contagion
effect
fundamentally
due
to
the
ongoing
crisis
in
turkey
