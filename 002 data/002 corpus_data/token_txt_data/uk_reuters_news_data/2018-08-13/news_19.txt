jdd
weekly
that
the
government
also
plans
to
increase
taxes
on

and
reduce
tax
on
recycling
activities
this
would
be
a
boost
for
french
recycling
firms
such
as
veolia
and
suez
which
have
called
for
such
measures
poirson
said
that
in
order
to
channel
more
plastic
waste
towards
recycling
france
will
introduce
a
system
worth
up
to
percent
of
the
price
of
a
product
in
order
to
encourage
consumers
to
recycle
tomorrow
when
there
is
a
choice
between
two
bottles
one
made
with
recycled
plastic
the
other
not

cheaper
she
said
she
gave
no
timeline
but
said
that
in

present
additional
and

socialist
french
government
in
banned
plastic
straws

of
president
emmanuel
macron
has
rejected
proposals
to
introduce
a
deposit
on
plastic
bottles
as
some
european
countries
have
done
asked
whether
it
was
sufficient
to
count
on
the
goodwill
of
industry
to
reach
macron
s
target
of
percent
plastic
recycling
by
poirson
said
that
imposing
new
regulation
too
quickly
would
lead
to
defensive
reactions
if
in
two
years
there
is
no
progress
we
will
introduce
regulation
she
said
france
recycles
just
percent
of
its
plastic
packaging
waste
the
recycling
rate
in
europe
it
compares
to
about
percent
in
germany
and
the
netherlands

statistics
portal

plastic
tableware
his

would
stop
selling
these

from
the
end
of
the

said
they
would
be
replaced
by
reusable
products
or
by
disposable
cups
and
plates
made
from
more
environmentally
friendly
materials
such
as
cardboard
or
bamboo

also
trialing
a
plastic
and
glass
bottle
deposit
system
in

its
stores
in
