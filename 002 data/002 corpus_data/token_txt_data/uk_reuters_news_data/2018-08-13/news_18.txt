thomson

foundation
for
four
generations
portz
family
life
has
focused
around
a
quaint
farmhouse
and
the
fertile
fields
beyond
ready
for
early
harvest
after
this
summer
s
high
heat
soon
the
family
will
pull
its
last
potato
and
final
spike
of
grain
from
the
rich
immerath
soil
big
coal
is
coming
to
replace
their
agrarian
way
of
life
the
portz
matriarch
puts
on
a
brave
face
as
she
folds
laundry
in
her
yard
the
ground
strewn
with
toys
it
s
always
jolly
here
christiane
portz
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
interrupted
by
a
chatter
of
grandchildren
who
make
noisily
for
the
stable
the
singsong
voices
the
spill
of
toys
everything
will
go
when
the
home
is
bulldozed
and
replaced
with
a
vast
coal
mine
immerath
once
a
small
village
of
in
germany
s
western
frontier
host
to
both
farms
and
industry
has
fallen
quiet
the
portz
family
is
one
of
the
last
households
still
in
situ
they
live
among
piles
of
rubble
after
neighbouring
families
were
resettled
k
west
at
new
immerath
roughly
billion
tons
of
lignite
a
soft
coal
were
discovered
long
ago
under
the
village
and
its
surrounding
land
in
germany
s
north
rhine
westphalia
state
few
locals
took
the
threat
seriously
so
life
continued
until
development
of
the
mine
became
reality
and
villages
were
lined
up
for
destruction
immerath
is
one
of
the
last
to
make
way
for
the
expansion
of
garzweiler
opencast
mine
which
is
run
by
giant
german
energy
provider
rwe
supplying
one
third
of
germany
s
overall
power
once
garzweiler
is
finished
villages
will
have
gone
under
the
scheme
some
people
will
be
forced
to
move
compensated
with
either
a
new
house
or
cash
rwe
says
almost
half
of
locals
just
take
the
money
our
expectation
is
that
garzweiler
will
be
open
until
the
middle
of
the
century
rwe
press
officer
guido
steffen
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
germany
is
making
radical
changes
but
even
in
the
long
run
in
order
to
provide
energy
we
can
t
forgo
conventional
power
once
finished
the
company
website
says
the
mine
will
cover
an
operating
surface
of
about
sq
km
the
size
of
the
approved
mining
field
is
sq
km
it
says
the
plan
to
expand
was
no
shock
for
locals
it
was
back
in
the
when
nearby
villages
first
made
way
for
coal
extraction
despite
loud
community
protests
and
protesters
say
the
march
of
commerce
over
community
continues
nationwide
germany
s
environmental
agency
says
the
federal
mining
act
prioritises
the
extraction
of
raw
materials
over
the
interests
of
the
common
good
since
hundreds
of
villages
yielded
to
a
growing
need
for
energy
with
percent
of
germany
s
power
coming
from
coal
rwe
europe
s
top
emitter
of
carbon
dioxide
admits
lignite
is
cheap
to
produce
but
harmful
for
the
environment
we
aim
to
halve
emissions
by
percent
by
rwe
s
steffen
said
what
s
left
of
immerath
and
other
nearby
villages
is
eerie
streets
and
abandoned
houses
the
noise
of
the
bulldozers
is
omnipresent
as
they
rumble
through
the
ghost
towns
immerath
s
village
church
lovingly
dubbed
the
cathedral
by
locals
who
financed
its
construction
years
ago
was
demolished
in
january
in
new
immerath
a
simple
modern
church
has
usurped
the
imposing
towered
cathedral
the
portz
family
is
due
to
leave
in
september
it
is
what
it
is
said
portz
who
is
in
her
and
helps
run
the
farm
we
ve
known
the
day
would
arrive
and
we
all
need
portz
insists
she
is
positive
about
her
new
home
too
the
old
farmhouse
will
be
swallowed
by
the
mine
and
the
family
will
move
to
three
modern
houses
k
away
her
husband
who
grew
up
on
the
family
farm
and
has
watched
two
more
generations
do
the
same
does
not
take
change
lightly
it
s
a
nightmare
i
think
about
it
constantly
said
her
husband
who
did
not
want
to
give
his
first
name
aside
from
the
human
cost
to
families
like
his
campaigners
count
the
wider
environmental
fallout
it
is
absolutely
unacceptable
that
coal
companies
like
rwe
still
want
to
destroy
homes
and
nature
for
dirty
lignite
it
is
inefficient
and
not
able
to
be
a
flexible
partner
for
clean
renewables
like
wind
and
solar
power
said
campaigner
anike
peters
of
greenpeace
along
with
local
residents
greenpeace
and
other
groups
have
protested
against
the
forced
resettlement
and
say
they
plan
to
step
up
the
demonstrations
local
resistance
against
lignite
is
stronger
than
ever
we
want
the
coal
to
stay
in
the
ground
said
johanna
winter
of
klimacamp
an
initiative
organised
to
protect
the
environment
more
protests
are
planned
this
month
against
what
maja
rothe
also
of
klimacamp
calls
a
clear
example
of
the
rules
of
capitalism
putting
boundaries
to
about
km
from
immerath
sits
berverath
a
small
farming
village
squeezed
between
green
fields
and
apple
trees
it
is
due
to
be
destroyed
in
and
local
agronomist
elionore
kreins
is
fighting
hard
for
her
farm
s
survival
during
a
first
meeting
with
rwe
a
representative
told
us
that
our
emotions
are
out
of
immediately
after
we
decided
to
get
legal
help
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
from
a
wooden
bench
at
her
farm
costs
are
steep
up
to
euros
an
hour
and
the
family
has
not
yet
sold
its
land
once
sold
rwe
finances
the
resettlement
we
are
expropriated
and
our
lifestyle
will
have
to
change
keeping
animals
in
town
is
allowed
in
berverath
but
it
won
t
be
possible
in
new
berverath
so
farmers
have
to
rethink
she
said
both
her
children
and
parents
live
on
the
farm
and
kreins
takes
care
of
her
elderly
mother
the
rules
mean
her
animals
can
not
figure
in
her
new
life
it
s
true
steffen
admitted
the
new
villages
have
to
abide
by
new
building
regulations
the
old
villages
will
look
like
modern
suburbs
with
detached
houses
and
small
lignite
extraction
is
due
to
start
in
the
village
by
and
will
continue
until
about
once
finished
the
area
will
be
flooded
with
rhine
water
and
turned
into
a
lake
the
destruction
of
villages
like
berverath
must
be
completely
avoided
said
greenpeace
s
peters
germany
must
phase
out
coal
until
at
the
back
in
immerath
a
small
house
still
stands
at
the
village
entrance
a
sign
above
the
door
reads
heimat
roughly
translated
as
but
this
very
german
concept
also
carries
a
sense
of
a
feeling
of
belonging
and
roots
empty
and
lifeless
the
house
now
sits
with
its
blinds
down
and
its
driveway
overgrown
waiting
for
the
bulldozer
to
call
euros
