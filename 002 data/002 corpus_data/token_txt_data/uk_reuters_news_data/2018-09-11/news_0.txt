l
eading
philanthropists
pledged
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
rescue
shrinking
tropical
forests
that
suck
carbon
dioxide
from
the
atmosphere
on
the
eve
of
a
global
climate
change
summit
in
san
francisco
nine
foundations
announced
the
million
commitment
to
be
delivered
over
the
next
four
years
a
day
ahead
of
the
global
climate
action
summit
which
is
expected
to
draw
about
delegates
from
city
and
regional
governments
while
the
world
heats
up
many
of
our
governments
have
been
slow
slow
to
act
and
so
we
in
philanthropy
must
step
up
darren
walker
president
of
the
ford
foundation
told
journalists
at
an
event
announcing
the
pledge
the
commitment
roughly
doubles
the
funds
the
groups
currently
dedicate
to
forest
protection
said
david
kaimowitz
a
director
at
the
ford
foundation
one
of
the
donors
charlotte
streck
director
of
think
tank
climate
focus
said
the
size
of
the
commitment
makes
the
groups
major
players
in
supporting
programs
norway
has
led
donor
efforts
by
pledging
up
to
million
a
year
to
help
tropical
nations
protect
their
forests
streck
said
but
the
new
money
committed
by
foundations
could
prove
more
flexible
and
nimble
than
money
from
governments
she
said
the
money
that
has
been
pledged
by
the
governments
like
norway
and
germany
the
uk
sits
mostly
in
trust
funds
with
the
world
bank
and
the
and
it
doesn
t
get
out
so
quickly
she
said
often
there
is
missing
here
or
missing
here
just
to
do
one
thing
or
develop
one
study
or
work
with
one
person
or
have
one
consultation
and
that
the
foundations
can
do
streck
said
other
groups
that
are
part
of
the
new
initiative
include
the
macarthur
foundation
and
the
rockefeller
foundation
funds
will
mostly
assist
indigenous
people
who
are
forest
dwellers
including
by
helping
them
secure
titles
to
land
they
live
on
so
it
can
not
be
sold
to
private
companies
without
their
agreement
said
walker
companies
come
to
our
village
our
forests
and
say
you
have
to
leave
because
i
have
the
license
from
the
government
said
rukka
sombolinggi
who
heads
the
indigenous
people
s
alliance
of
the
archipelago
aman
the
world
loses
the
equivalent
of
soccer
fields
worth
of
forest
every
minute
organizers
said
yet
forests
absorb
a
third
of
the
annual
greenhouse
gas
emissions
produced
and
those
emissions
need
to
be
slashed
substantially
more
to
meet
the
goals
set
in
the
paris
agreement
the
paris
climate
agreement
adopted
by
almost
nations
in
set
a
goal
of
limiting
warming
to
well
below
a
rise
of
degrees
celsius
above
times
while
pursuing
efforts
for
the
tougher
goal
of
degrees
the
global
climate
action
summit
was
organized
by
californian
authorities
and
the
united
nations
to
support
the
leadership
of
mayors
governors
and
other
authorities
in
curbing
climate
