trump's epa proposes weaker methane rules for oil and gas wells
reuters
the
trump
administration
on
tuesday
proposed
weakening
requirements
for
testing
and
repairing
methane
leaks
in
drilling
operations
among
other
measures
in
a
step
toward
rolling
back
an
policy
to
combat
climate
change
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
said
the
changes
will
save
the
industry
million
a
year
in
regulatory
costs
between
and
while
increasing
methane
emissions
methane
the
primary
component
of
natural
gas
leaks
from
oil
and
gas
wells
during
drilling
it
accounts
for
percent
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
has
more
than
times
the
potential
of
carbon
dioxide
in
the
first
years
after
it
escapes
into
the
atmosphere
the
oil
and
gas
sector
is
the
largest
single
source
of
methane
emissions
according
to
epa
data
the
proposal
is
the
latest
move
by
the
trump
administration
to
roll
back
environmental
rules
put
in
place
by
former
president
barack
obama
last
month
the
administration
proposed
rolling
back
tougher
fuel
efficiency
standards
for
vehicles
and
moved
to
replace
a
policy
to
limit
emissions
from
power
plants
with
one
that
would
allow
states
to
write
their
own
standards
last
year
it
delayed
implementing
the
rule
limiting
methane
gas
emissions
from
oil
and
gas
operations
on
federal
and
tribal
lands
under
the
new
proposal
methane
gas
emissions
will
increase
by
a
total
short
tons
between
and
compared
with
the
epa
s
baseline
estimate
obama
s
updates
to
the
epa
s
new
source
performance
standards
envisioned
preventing
emissions
of
short
tons
of
methane
in
rising
to
preventing
short
tons
of
methane
emissions
in
it
s
unfortunate
that
the
trump
administration
is
once
again
ignoring
facts
and
common
sense
only
to
put
the
interests
of
the
nation
s
oil
and
gas
companies
ahead
of
the
health
and
welfare
of
all
americans

proposal
is
subject
to

comments
for
days
including
a
public
hearing
to
be
held
