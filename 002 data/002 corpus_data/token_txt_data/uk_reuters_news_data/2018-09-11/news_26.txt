local
authorities
will
carve
out
a
larger
role
in
fighting
rising
temperatures
globally
as
national
governments
have
been
slow
to
take
action
said
organizers
of
a
climate
change
summit
beginning
on
wednesday
in
san
francisco
about
delegates
from
city
and
regional
governments
as
well
as
industries
and
research
institutions
will
attend
the
global
climate
action
summit
which
was
put
together
by
californian
authorities
and
the
united
nations
the
gathering
will
deepen
the
leadership
of
authorities
in
curbing
climate
change
a
battle
that
almost
nations
have
also
joined
under
the
paris
climate
accord
according
to
organizers
we
re
moving
into
a
new
wave
a
new
phase
of
stepped
up
climate
action
said
summit
spokesman
nick
nuttall
adding
that
the
event
is
expected
to
yield
joint
pledges
to
limit
temperature
increases
the
gathering
reflects
a
desire
to
bypass
the
slow
progress
of
national
governments
in
implementing
paris
agreement
goals
said
michael
burger
executive
director
of
the
sabin
center
for
climate
change
law
at
new
york
s
columbia
university
the
paris
pact
aims
to
limit
the
rise
in
global
temperatures
to
well
below
degrees
celsius
fahrenheit
and
ideally
to
degrees
celsius
with
a
sweeping
goal
of
ending
the
fossil
fuel
era
this
century
the
agreement
is
due
to
come
into
force
in
but
negotiations
over
how
to
roll
out
the
treaty
have
exposed
disagreements
about
funding
for
developing
countries
this
week
s
summit
in
california
is
heavy
with
symbolism
as
the
united
states
is
the
only
country
to
announce
its
intention
to
withdraw
from
the
paris
pact
following
a
decision
by
president
donald
trump
last
year
it
can
be
and
should
be
seen
as
a
response
to
the
abdication
of
leadership
by
the
federal
government
which
has
really
created
a
vacuum
for
leadership
burger
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
gathering
follows
a
summer
marked
by
mounting
signs
of
a
rapidly
warming
atmosphere
record
heatwaves
and
wildfires
this
summer
have
been
linked
to
temperatures
worldwide
local
government
administrators
are
expected
to
announce
initiatives
about
electric
vehicles
and
forest
conservation
while
companies
will
likely
pledge
to
roll
back
greenhouse
gas
emissions
nuttall
said
national
governments
from
more
than
a
dozen
countries
including
china
and
britain
are
also
sending
representatives
china
s
presence
is
to
be
particularly
heavy
and
it
will
have
its
own
pavilion
on
the
sidelines
of
the
gathering
china
is
the
world
s
largest
emitter
of
greenhouse
gasses
followed
by
the
united
states
according
to
the
world
resources
institute
a
washington
research
organization
chinese
officials
saw
the
meeting
as
a
way
to
make
real
progress
outside
of
political
circles
in
washington
said
daniel
sperling
a
professor
of
environmental
sciences
at
the
university
of
california
davis
they
like
very
much
working
with
us
in
california
because
it
s
below
the
radar
it
s
not
white
house
politics
said
sperling
who
is
also
a
member
of
the
california
air
resources
board
the
state
s
clean
air
regulator
california
s
governor
jerry
brown
defied
the
government
s
retreat
from
the
paris
pact
by
branding
it
insane
and
immediately
flying
to
china
to
foster
greater
cooperation
on
clean
energy
the
gathering
brown
said
in
a
phone
interview
was
not
designed
to
sway
trump
s
opinion
on
climate
change
but
he
said
he
hoped
it
would
awaken
other
members
of
the
republican
party
to
the
existential
threat
of
global
warming
and
to
its
economic
potential
ahead
of
a
general
election
to
be
held
in
november
we
are
late
and
we
have
to
accelerate
our
efforts
to
reduce
emissions
he
said
policies
encouraging
bus
transportation
green
buildings
and
clean
energy
could
generate
million
jobs
in
cities
globally
by
offsetting
job
losses
in
the
energy
industry
according
to
a
report
this
week
by
a
