near
highs
on

the
mood
in
europe
even
though
the
ongoing
trade
dispute
between
washington
and
beijing
kept
world
stocks
trading
just
off
lows
italy
was
the
other
bright
spot
in
europe
as
receding
concerns
over
public
finances
helped
bonds
extend
their
rally
while
a
slight
dollar
retreat
helped
emerging
market
currencies
claw
back
some
recent
losses
msci
s
index
of
global
equities
was
flat
on
the
day
though
asian
bourses
were
in
the
red
for
the
ninth
straight
day
as
markets
awaited

from

donald
trump
after

has
signalled
his
desire

push
ahead
on
the
brexit
negotiations
less
than
seven
months
before
the
united
kingdom
is
slated
to
leave
the
european
union
on
march
the
barnier
headlines
mean
there
s
a
lower
hurdle
for
getting
a
seperation
deal
done
by
the
end
of
the
year
when
the
discussion
about
the

relationship
can
begin
said
cmc
markets
analyst
michael
hewson
also
the
fact
that
trump
still
hasn
t
announced
the
tariffs
yet
as
expected
has
prompted
a
bit
of
cautious
optimism
but
it
s
not
a
problem
that

going
to
go
away

added

italian
politicians
signalled
that
an
upcoming

likely
fall
