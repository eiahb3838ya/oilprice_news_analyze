oil
exports
to
japan
and
south

will
rise

this

as
asian
refiners
take
advantage
of

steep
discounts
american
sellers
are
offering
after
losing
chinese
customers
amid
the

the

source
said
south
korean
and
japanese
refiners
have
been
taking
advantage
of
steep
discounts
of
up
to
per
barrel
between
the
crude
benchmark
west

intermediate
wti
that
american
producers
base
their
crude
sales
on
and
the
international
brent
crude
benchmark
they
south
koreans
and
japanese
refiners
need
to
find
replacements
for
their
drop
in
iran
imports
and
a
fair
amount
of
that
is
coming
from
the
states
the
steep
discount
of
wti
to
brent
is
hard
to
resist
said
a
ship
broker
the
sources
declined
to
be
named
as
they
were
not
allowed
to
talk
about
commercial
operations
in
public
our
crude
oil
purchase
is
purely
because
of
its
price
advantage

said
his

had
not
received
government
orders
to
halt
iranian
oil
imports
he
would
not
comment
on
commercial
operations
beyond
saying
we
will
determine
optimum
crude
in
our
own
procurement
japan
and
south
korea
were
among
the
first
major
iranian
clients
to
bow
to
pressure
and
cut
orders
from
iran
the
producer
among
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
with
south
korea
importing
its
last
cargoes
in
july
the
trade
data
showed
india
typically
the
buyer
of
iranian
oil
after
china
has
also
dialed
back
iranian
orders
while
importing
more
from
the
united
states
the
data
showed
iran
crude
exports
to
asia
with
middle
east
crude
markets
tightening
because
of
the
start
of
sanctions
against
iran
in
november
many
asian
refiners
have
been
seeking
to
make
up
the
shortfall
with
american
supply
greg
mckenna
chief
market
strategist
at
futures
brokerage
axitrader
said
there
has
been
a
divergence
between
brent
and
prices
including
benchmark
wti
are
under
pressure
amid
rising
production
and
a
decline
in
chinese
buying
interest
because
of
the
trade
dispute
which
is
forcing
sellers
to
find
new
buyers
for
their
crude
meanwhile
the
brent
benchmark
is
supported
by
several
supply
disruptions
including
the
iranian
sanctions
tumbling
exports
from
venezuela
and
lingering
concerns
about
libyan
production
amid
clashes
between
internal
groups
there
are
still
plenty
of
battles
and
other
influences
to
disrupt
brent
supply
which
has
kept
traders
interested
mckenna
said
referring
to
concerns
about
supplies
that
tend
to
be
priced
off
brent
including
from
libya
west
africa
and
the
middle
east
whether
this
price
divergence
will
last
is
not
clear
there
are
signs
that
saudi
arabia
and
russia
will
increase
output
to
take
up
iranian
market
share
which
should
ease
brent
prices
meanwhile
prices
could
rise
because
the
surge
in
demand
may
exacerbate
logistical
bottlenecks
since
the
current
domestic
pipeline
port
and
storage
infrastructure
is
not
geared
to
handle
exports
on
this
scale
this
congestion
is
already
causing
offers
to
rise
for
supply
for
loading
towards
the
end
of
the
year
although
no
fixed
deals
have
been
reported
