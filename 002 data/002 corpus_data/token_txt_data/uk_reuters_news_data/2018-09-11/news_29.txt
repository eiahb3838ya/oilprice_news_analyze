world
stocks
slipped
back
towards

on
tuesday
on
ongoing
concerns
over
the
trade
dispute
between
washington
and
beijing
while
the
pound
hovered
near
a
high
on
hopes
of
a
deal
over
brexit
msci
s
index
of
global
equities
inched
lower
on
the
day
after
european
shares
joined
asian
bourses
in
the
red
as
markets
awaited
action
from
president
donald
trump
after
the
expiry
of
a
deadline
for
public
comment
on
additional

european

hopes
around
a
new
brexit
deal
kept
the
british
pound
near
highs
however
helping
lighten
the
mood
a
touch
in
europe
the
currency
which
rose
percent
on
monday
after
the
european
union
s
chief
negotiator
michel
barnier
said
a
brexit
deal
was
possible
within
weeks
hit
a
new
high
of
it
slightly
slipped
off
those
levels
as
the
trade
worries
returned
to
lift
the
dollar
off
the
day
s
lows
however
it
was
the
second
time
in
less
than
a
week
that
barnier
signalled
his
desire
to
push
ahead
on
brexit
negotiations
less
than
seven
months
before
the
united
kingdom
is
slated
to
leave
the
european
union
on
march
his
comments
have
eased
some
of
the
anxiety
that
britain
would
exit
from
the
eu
without
any
formal
trading
arrangement
the
barnier
headlines
mean
there
s
a
lower
hurdle
for
getting
a
separation
deal
done
by
the
end
of
the
year
when
the
discussion
about
the
future
relationship
can
begin
said
cmc
markets
analyst
michael
hewson
also
the
fact
that
trump
still
hasn
t
announced
the
tariffs
yet
as
expected
has
prompted
a
bit
of
cautious
optimism
but
it
s
not
a
problem
that
s
going
to
go
away

likely
fall
