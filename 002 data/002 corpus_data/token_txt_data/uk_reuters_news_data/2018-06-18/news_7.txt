five
shale

to
withdraw
from
a
scheduled
speaking
slot
at
the
opec
meeting
in
vienna
his
withdrawal
comes
days
after
a
trade
skirmish
between
china
and
the
united
states
intensified
with
china
imposing
billion
in
tariffs
on
crude
oil
and
other

measure
on
washington
s
tariffs
of
chinese
products
continental
the
largest
oil
producer
in
north
dakota
s
bakken
shale
formation
has
been
a
key
supplier
of
crude
oil
to
china
shipping
more
than
million
barrels
to
the
country
since
a
crude
export
ban
was
lifted
in
it
was
unclear
how
china
will
replace
that
source
of
crude
but
several
opec
countries
produce
crude
grades
similar
to
continental
s
bakken
wells
continental
spokeswoman
kristin
thomas
confirmed
hamm
s
withdrawal
saying
the
event
did
not
fit
with
his
schedule
the
company

not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for
further
comment
on
the
china
tariffs
hamm
who
was
an
informal
campaign
adviser
to
president
donald
trump
in
and
was
considered
for
a
cabinet
post
had
been
listed
since
at
least
march
on
the
opec
international
seminar
website
as
a
speaker
here
his
attendance
had
been
widely
anticipated
as
he
had
derided
opec
as
a
toothless
tiger
in
trump
also
chided
opec
last
week
blaming
the
group
for
rising
oil
prices
and
saying
its
members
were
at
it
yet
hamm
has
appeared
in
recent
months
to
be
trying
to
reach
a
more
conciliatory
tone
with
opec
producers
last
month
he
attended
a
board
meeting
of
saudi
aramco
the
oil
producer
controlled
by
opec
s
largest
member
saudi
arabia
he
has
also
begun
asking
fellow
shale
producers
to
focus
more
on
profitability
and
less
on
profligate
production
hamm
s
withdrawal
leaves
only
two
shale

and
conocophillips
ryan
lance
also
withdrew
from
the
opec
event
lance
himself
pulled
out
because
of
concerns
his
participation
would
seem
as
if
he
were
the
designate
representative
at
such
a
forum
according
to
a
source
familiar
with
the
company
s
thinking
