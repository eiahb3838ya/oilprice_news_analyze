unite
a
divided
country
behind
his
plans
to
toughen
a

accord
with
marxist
rebels
and
rekindle

growth
but
he
will
face
major
challenges
when
he
takes

in
august
the
former
senator
comfortably
won
sunday
s
election
with
percent
of
votes
against
leftist
rival
gustavo
petro
who
garnered
percent
with
his
pledge
to
shake
up
colombia
s
economic
model
and
tackle
inequality
both
the
colombian
peso
and
local
treasury
bonds
fell
on
monday
due
to
external
factors
analysts
said
though
in
the
medium
term
investment
flows
are
expected
to
increase
based
on
support
for
duque
s
policies
the
peso
was
down
percent
to
per
dollar
while
the
yield
on
local
treasury
bonds
known
as
tes
coming
due
in
july
rose
to
percent
from
percent
on
friday
it
was
the
first
presidential
election
since
a
peace
agreement
with
the
revolutionary
armed
forces
of
colombia
farc
which
ended
its
part
in
a
conflict
that
has
killed
more
than
people
and
displaced
millions
duque
pledged
in
his
victory
speech
to
unite
the
polarized
andean
country
and
tackle
corruption
improve
security
and
increase
educational
opportunities
peace
is
something
all
colombians
yearn
for
and
peace
means
that
we
turn
the
page
on
the
fissures
that
have
divided
us
duque
told
cheering
crowds
at
his
celebration
party
on
sunday
night
in
bogota
as
confetti
rained
down
duque
a
protégé
of
former
president
alvaro
uribe
first
grabbed
attention
railing
from
congress
against
the
peace
deal
which
he
believes
is
too
easy
on
former
rebel
leaders
striking
a
conciliatory
tone
on
sunday
he
promised
to
guarantee
justice
for
victims
and
the
reintegration
of
rebels
into
colombian
society
his
aim
of
revamping
the
agreement
to
impose
tougher
punishment
on
farc
leaders
for
war
crimes
will
face
considerable
opposition
from
the
constitutional
court
and
congress
where
most
parties
favour
implementing
the
existing
accord
the
farc
has
invited
duque
to
discuss
the
accord
he
is
going
to
have
a
harder
time
passing
reforms
to
the
peace
agreement
than
he
would
have
his
supporters
believe
said
sergio
guzman
colombia
lead
analyst
for
consultancy
control
risks
singling
out
the
constitutional
court
which
has
already
ruled
that
the
deal
can
not
be
changed
the
court
is
responsible
for
deciding
whether
laws
passed
by
congress
are
in
line
with
the
constitution
duque
needs
to
include
politicians
from
centrist
parties
in
his
cabinet
if
he
wants
to
unite
the
country
guzman
said
he
is
likely
to
reveal
the
names
of
some
ministers
this
week
duque
will
face
no
shortage
of
security
challenges
crime
gangs
allied
with
mexican
drug
traffickers
the
national
liberation
army
eln
the
remaining
rebel
group
as
well
as
farc
dissidents
who
have
refused
to
demobilize
have
moved
into
territory
left
behind
by
the
farc
only
million
people
just
over
half
of
eligible
voters
participated
in
the
election
suggesting
some
centrists
did
not
like
either
choice
duque
has
promised
to
bolster
colombia
s
billion
economy
with
tax
cuts
and
support
for
extractive
industries
such
as
oil
and
coal
the
country
s
top
exports
the
government
expects
the
economy
to
grow
percent
this
year
with
the
election
of
ivan
duque
the
business
sector
made
up
of
both
local
and
foreign
investment
will
see
fiscal
reforms
that
will
seek
a
reduction
of
the
tax
burden
for
businesses
and
the
simplification
of
administrative
processes
said
ciro
meza
of
law
firm
baker
mckenzie
some
economists
are
concerned
that
duque
s
proposed
tax
cuts
may
worsen
the
budget
deficit
and
force
him
to
push
through
unpopular
reforms
including
a
pension
overhaul
to
preserve
colombia
s
credit
rating
ratings
agency
fitch
said
on
monday
that
duque
s
victory
signals
a
continuation
of
economic
policies
but
added
that
a
fiscal
consolidation
and
encouraging
growth
are
his
government
s
key
challenges
while
oil
has
been
the
main
driver
for
peso
movements
the
election
has
added
to
the
currency
s
volatility
according
to
kenneth
lam
a
new
latin
america
foreign
exchange
strategist
at
citigroup
now
that
we
got
the
electoral
outcome
we
expected
oil
reverts
to
be
the
main
driver
for
the
peso
which
has
been
outperforming
other
latin
american
currencies
he
said
alberto
carrasquilla
who
served
as
finance
minister
during
uribe
s
first
term
and
was
duque
s
economic
adviser
during
the
campaign
could
reprise
the
finance
minister
role
capital
economics
said
in
a
note
and
would
be
a
safe
pair
of
duque
has
said
he
will
curb
eln
attacks
on
pipelines
and
invest
in
oil
company
ecopetrol
s
refineries
to
allow
exports
of
more
crude
derivatives
although
petro
a
former
rebel
won
a
majority
in
only
eight
provinces
and
the
capital
bogota
the
fact
that
a
leftist
received
million
votes
versus
million
for
duque
is
historic
in
traditionally
conservative
colombia
the
fractured
left
has
failed
for
decades
to
come
close
to
winning
colombia
s
presidency
overshadowed
by
contenders
who
promised
security
yet
the
farc
deal
has
shifted
priorities
for
many
of
colombia
s
more
than
million
people
voters
are
interested
in
tackling
inequality
corruption
and
inadequate
social
services
which
could
create
opportunities
for
the
left
if
duque
is
not
able
to
get
moving
on
his
promises
and
see
concrete
results
and
if
he
doesn
t
look
for
reconciliation
the
left
could
win
in
