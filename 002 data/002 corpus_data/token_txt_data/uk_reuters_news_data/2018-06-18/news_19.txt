colombia
s
ivan
duque
has
promised
to
unite
a
divided
country
behind
his
plans
to
toughen
a
peace
accord
with
marxist
rebels
and
to
rekindle
economic
growth
but
he
will
face
major
challenges
when
he
takes
office
in
august
the
former
senator
comfortably
won
sunday
s
election
with
percent
of
votes
against
his
leftist
rival
gustavo
petro
who
garnered
percent
with
his
pledge
to
shake
up
colombia
s
economic
model
and
tackle
inequality
market
reaction
to
duque
s
victory
is
expected
to
be
muted
because
he
held
a
strong
poll
lead
going
into
the
election
and
investors
are
largely
supportive
of
his
economic
policies
it
was
the
first
presidential
election
since
a
peace
deal
with
the
revolutionary
armed
forces
of
colombia
farc
which
ended
its
part
in
a
conflict
that
has
killed
more
than
people
and
displaced
millions
duque
pledged
in
his
victory
speech
to
unite
the
polarized
andean
country
and
tackle
corruption
to
improve
security
and
increase
educational
opportunities
peace
is
something
all
colombians
yearn
for
and
peace
means
that
we
turn
the
page
on
the
fissures
that
have
divided
us
duque
told
cheering
crowds
at
his
celebration
party
in
bogota
as
confetti
rained
down
duque
a
protégé
of
former
president
alvaro
uribe
won
fame
railing
from
congress
against
the
peace
deal
which
he
believes
is
too
easy
on
former
rebel
leaders
striking
a
conciliatory
tone
on
sunday
he
promised
to
press
ahead
with
implementing
the
disarmament
and
reinserting
ordinary
rebels
into
colombian
society
his
aim
of
revamping
the
agreement
to
impose
tougher
punishments
for
war
crimes
on
farc
leaders
will
face
considerable
opposition
from
the
constitutional
court
and
congress
where
most
parties
favor
implementing
the
existing
accord
he
is
going
to
have
a
harder
time
passing
reforms
to
the
peace
agreement
than
he
would
have
his
supporters
believe
said
sergio
guzman
control
risks
lead
analyst
for
colombia
singling
out
the
constitutional
court
which
has
already
ruled
that
the
deal
can
not
be
changed
duque
needs
to
include
politicians
from
centrist
parties
in
his
cabinet
if
he
wants
to
unite
the
country
guzman
said
he
is
likely
to
reveal
the
names
of
some
ministers
this
week
only
million
people
just
over
half
of
eligible
voters
participated
in
the
election
suggesting
some
centrists
preferred
not
to
vote
for
either
choice
duque
has
promised
to
bolster
colombia
s
billion
economy
via
tax
cuts
and
support
for
extractive
industries
such
as
oil
and
coal
the
country
s
top
exports
the
government
expects
the
economy
to
grow
percent
this
year
from
an
economic
point
of
view
duque
s
victory
is
reassuring
said
carlos
sepulveda
the
dean
of
economy
at
rosario
university
it
creates
a
positive
panorama
for
the
colombian
economy
although
there
will
be
a
lot
of
challenges
in
the
months
some
economists
have
raised
concern
that
duque
s
proposed
tax
cuts
may
worsen
the
budget
deficit
and
force
him
to
push
through
unpopular
reforms
including
a
pension
overhaul
to
preserve
colombia
s
credit
rating
duque
has
said
he
will
curb
attacks
by
remaining
leftist
rebels
on
pipelines
and
invest
in
oil
company
ecopetrol
s
refineries
to
allow
exports
of
more
derivatives
although
petro
a
former
rebel
won
a
majority
in
only
eight
provinces
and
the
capital
bogota
the
fact
a
leftist
got
million
votes
versus
million
for
duque
is
historic
in
traditionally
conservative
colombia
the
fractured
left
has
failed
for
decades
to
come
close
to
winning
colombia
s
presidency
overshadowed
by
contenders
who
promised
security
yet
the
farc
deal
has
shifted
priorities
for
many
of
colombia
s
nearly
million
people
voter
interest
in
tackling
inequality
corruption
and
inadequate
social
services
looks
set
to
create
opportunities
for
the
left
if
duque
is
not
able
to
get
moving
on
his
promises
and
to
see
concrete
results
and
if
he
doesn
t
look
for
reconciliation
the
left
could
win
in
