should
be
brought
forward
by
years
to
in
the
latest
push
to
improve

quality
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
conservative
government
said
last
year
it
would
ban
the
sale
of
new
petrol
and
diesel
cars
from
although
it
is
unclear
whether
that
includes
hybrid
vehicles
which
have
both
an
electric
and
combustion
engine
the
government
is
due
to
detail
the
proposals
in
a
road
to
zero
plan
shortly
but
on
monday
khan
joined
mayors
and
city
leaders
from
manchester
liverpool
oxford
sheffield
and
bristol
to
call
for
the
measures
to
be
implemented
quicker
banning
the
sale

new
petrol
and
diesel
vehicles
by
providing
support
to
deliver
clean

cities

introducing
a

renewal
scheme
will
dramatically
improve
our
air
quality
and
our
health
said
khan
who
is
from
the
opposition
labour
party
cities
and
nations
around

are
introducing
restrictions

bans
on
the
use
of

carmakers
have
argued
that
cleaner
diesel
models
play
a
part
in
bringing
down
overall
carbon
dioxide
emissions
but
demand
for
the
segment
has
nosedived
in
much
of
europe
for
over
a
year
as
many
authorities
plan
clampdowns
and
tax
hikes
