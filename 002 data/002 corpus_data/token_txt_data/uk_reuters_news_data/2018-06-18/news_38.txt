exxonmobil
corp
southeastern
australia
s
biggest
gas
supplier
is
considering
importing
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
to
help
plug
a
looming
gas
shortage
from
and
protect
its
market
share
the
move
would
compete
with
plans
by
both
australia
s
energy
retailer
agl
energy
to
start
importing
lng
by
and
a
consortium
involving
japan
s
jera
to
start
imports
from
exxonmobil
is
also
stepping
up
exploration
off
the
coast
of
victoria
and
considering
developing
a
gas
field
called
west
barracouta
close
to
an
existing
field
it
said
in
an
emailed
statement
on
monday
combined
with
the
existing
gippsland
resource
and
infrastructure
an
lng
import
facility
could
ensure
exxonmobil
can
continue
to
meet
our
customers
needs
the
company
said
the
facility
could
open
by
it
said
australia
s
energy
market
operator
warned
in
march
that
victoria
the
country
s
biggest
gas
consuming
state
could
face
shortages
from
due
to
a
rapid
drop
in
supply
from
the
the
gippsland
basin
joint
venture
owned
by
exxonmobil
and
bhp
billiton
output
from
the
gippsland
basin
the
state
s
mainstay
supplier
over
the
past
years
is
expected
to
fall
to
just
half
of
levels
by
it
said
even
though
australia
is
set
to
challenge
qatar
as
the
world
s
top
lng
exporter
local
gas
supplies
are
under
threat
due
to
field
declines
and
export
contracts
exxonmobil
could
use
a
lot
of
its
existing
infrastructure
at
longford
in
victoria
for
an
lng
import
facility
the
company
declined
to
comment
on
an
estimate
by
macquarie
analysts
cited
in
the
australian
newspaper
that
it
could
build
import
facilities
for
around
a
million
million
less
than
half
the
estimated
cost
of
the
two
rival
lng
import
plans
agl
is
working
toward
a
final
investment
decision
for
its
import
plans
by
june
if
we
saw
some
new
supply
come
to
market
that
fundamentally
changed
that
market
dynamic
we
would
revisit
the
business
case
but
we
haven
t
seen
that
to
date
agl
general
manager
phaedra
deckart
told
reuters
in
an
interview
last
week
she
said
rising
lng
prices
would
not
deter
the
company
from
going
ahead
with
the
plan
it
s
not
about
what
price
can
we
bring
lng
into
the
market
it
s
about
meeting
the
needs
of
our
million
gas
customers
and
the
large
industrial
customers
that
have
executed
tentative
agreements
with
us
and
are
looking
for
a
new
source
of
supply
to
meet
that
shortfall
beyond
australian
dollars
