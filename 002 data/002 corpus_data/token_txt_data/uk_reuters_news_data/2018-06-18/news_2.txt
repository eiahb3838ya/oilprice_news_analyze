global
stocks
were
lower
on
monday
as
investors
eyed
an
escalating
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
while
oil
prices
rose
on
bets
that
an
opec

retaliate
immediately
by
suspending

trade
agreements
with
trump
s
administration
and
slapping

on
american
exports
including
crude

the
biggest
thing
hanging
over

is
trade

between

china
said
chris
zaccarelli

officer
at

but
if
people
thought
this
was
really
going
to
be
a
trade
war
stocks
would
be
down
a

more
the
fact
they

opec

russia
have
been
restricting

since
the
start
of
bob
yawger
director

at

said
indications
from

other

producers
on
the
scale
of
potential
production
increases
would
drive
the
market
this

the
immediate
fallout
from
the
trade
dispute
was
limited
in
currencies
although
the
escalation
seemed
to
encourage
some
risk
aversion
as
the
japanese

recovered

while
the

was
up

to
it
s
tough
to
say
whether
it
will
spiral
further

it

our
base
case
is
that
there

be
