with
tariffs
on

to
immediately

fears

trump
on
friday
announced
hefty
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
imports
laying
out
a
list
of
more
than
strategically
important
imports
from
china
that
would
be
subject
to
a
percent
tariff
starting
on
july
including
cars
china
said
it
would
respond
with
tariffs
of
the
same
scale
and
strength
and
that
any
previous
trade
deals
with
trump
were
the
official
xinhua
news
agency
said
china
would
impose
percent
tariffs
on
products
ranging
from
soybeans
and
autos
to
seafood
china
s

list
was
increased
more
than
from
a
version
released
in
april
but
the
value
was
kept
at
billion
as
some
items
such
as
commercial
aircraft
were
deleted
analysts
say
the
direct
impact
of
those
tariffs
may
be
limited
especially
for
the
economy
which
is
in
a
strong
shape
with
the
jobless
rate
at
the
lowest
level
since
with
limited
inflationary
pressure
many
market
watchers
believe
the
move
was
a
negotiating
tactic
to
wring
greater
and
faster
concessions
from
beijing
yet
investors
worry
the
tensions
could
escalate
further
possibly
causing
world
trade
to
slow
down
and
dampening
business
confidence
there
are
trade
frictions
not
only
between
the
and
china
but
also
between
the
and
its
allies
trump
could
put
more
pressure
on
other
countries
like
japan
and
nato
courtiers
said
yoshinori
shigemi
global
market
strategist
at
jpmorgan
asset
management
in
tokyo
so
far
investors
have
been
escaping
to
shares
and
small
cap
shares
after
all
money
is
still
abundant
but
investors
should
be
cautious
he
added
in
the
currency
market
the
dollar
was
supported
for
now
as
the
euro
has
lost
steam
after
the
european
central
bank
had
suggested
on
thursday
it
would
hold
off
raising
interest
rates
through
the
summer
of

of
concerns
about
trade
policies
oil
prices
were
under
pressure
on
fears
of
