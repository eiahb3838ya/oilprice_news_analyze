update 1-saudi arabia, russia seek 1.5 mln bpd opec, non-opec output increase - ecuador
vienna
reuters
russia
and
saudi
arabia
have
put
forward
a
proposal
to
increase
production
by
opec
and
countries
by
million
barrels
per
day
ecuador
s
oil
minister
said
on
monday
carlos
perez
said
on
his
arrival
in
vienna
for
the
meeting
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
that
this
was
the
only
proposal
he
has
seen
being
put
forward
and
that
the
proposed
increase
would
be
from
the
quota
that
the
members
of
the
deal
had
agreed
on
opec
s
second
and
third
largest
producers
iraq
and
iran
have
said
they
would
oppose
steep
output
increases
as
it
would
breach
previous
agreements
to
keep
production
cuts
in
place
until
the
end
of
the
year
both
countries
would
struggle
to
increase
output
significantly
as
iran
is
facing
renewed
sanctions
that
will
impact
its
oil
industry
and
iraq
still
has
production
constraints
by
contrast
saudi
arabia
and
its
gulf
allies
have
capacity
to
raise
output
and
have
said
they
were
keen
to
meet
calls
from
consumers
such
as
the
united
states
and
china
to
cool
down
oil
prices
and
help
meet
global
oil
demand
russia
has
also
said
that
limiting
production
for
too
long
could
encourage
too
much
production
growth
from
the
united
states
which
is
not
part
of
the
agreement
to
curb
output
