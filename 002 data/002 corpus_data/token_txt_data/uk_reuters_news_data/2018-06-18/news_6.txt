london
june
reuters
swedish
power
producer
vattenfall
is
on
course
to
pay
a
dividend
on
annual
profits
for
a
second
year
in
a
row
as
it
benefits
from
higher
european
electricity
prices
its
chief
executive
told
reuters
after
years
of
losses
caused
by
a
financially
disastrous
expansion
out
the
nordic
region
that
led
to
huge
writedowns
and
job
losses
vattenfall
announced
its
first
dividend
in
five
years
in
february
based
on
its
results
meanwhile
an
unusually
cold
winter
pushed
up
power
prices
in
vattenfall
s
markets
creating
a
positive
start
to
we
are
working
towards
increasing
our
profits
we
are
now
entering
a
price
increase
environment
if
nothing
very
particular
happens
i
hope
to
pay
dividend
ceo
magnus
hall
said
vattenfall
aims
to
establish
a
run
of
years
he
said
but
declined
to
give
a
dividend
or
profit
forecast
for
dividend
is
important
if
you
started
to
pay
dividend
i
think
it
is
prudent
to
expect
a
strategy
where
you
don
t
see
one
year
paying
a
dividend
and
the
next
one
not
paying
he
said
in
february
vattenfall
proposed
a
dividend
of
billion
crowns
million
or
percent
of
its
profit
to
its
owner
the
swedish
government
against
a
target
range
of
percent
of
profit
after
tax
in
may
vattenfall
announced
a
deal
with
facebook
to
supply
the
company
s
scandinavian
data
centres
with
power
from
norway
and
sweden
and
said
it
was
aiming
for
more
such
deals
although
power
prices
in
the
two
nordic
countries
have
doubled
this
summer
compared
with
a
year
ago
operating
data
centres
there
was
still
more
attractive
than
elsewhere
in
europe
hall
said
they
data
centre
operators
look
at
sweden
and
norway
as
countries
where
prices
have
been
traditionally
lower
than
in
europe
and
where
they
would
expect
them
to
be
lower
in
the
future
in
comparison
he
said
norway
and
sweden
face
higher
power
costs
this
summer
as
much
of
the
snow
in
their
mountains
evaporated
or
melted
into
the
ground
during
a
heat
wave
from
until
early
june
instead
of
reaching
hydropower
reservoirs
