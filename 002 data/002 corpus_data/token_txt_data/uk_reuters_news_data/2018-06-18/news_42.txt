china
s
imports
of
venezuelan
crude
oil
could
sink
to
their
lowest
in
nearly
eight
years
in
july
as
the
opec
producer
struggles
with
shrinking
output
and
mounting
logistics
issues
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
matter
and
shipping
data
petrochina
expects
june
loadings
from
venezuela
mainly
the
merey
grade
to
be
half
the
normal
rates
according
to
two
oil
officials
briefed
on
the
matter
venezuela
s
state
firm
pdvsa
has
promised
the
lost
volume
would
be
topped
up
in
july
loadings
for
arrival
in
they
said
the
plunge
in
supplies
to
venezuela
s
most
important
customer
creditor
and
political
ally
is
the
latest
indicator
of
tough
times
for
the
country
with
the
world
s
largest
oil
reserves
crude
output
fell
to
the
lowest
annual
average
in
over
three
decades
between
january
and
april
while
claims
on
assets
by
creditors
have
cut
off
pdvsa
s
access
to
export
terminals
the
slide
cuts
both
ways
china
s
growing
thirst
for
oil
amid
economic
growth
is
increasing
its
reliance
on
imports
while
venezuela
s
trouble
exporting
as
its
infrastructure
crumbles
means
it
s
missing
out
on
crude
oil
prices
that
have
risen
to
their
highest
in
years
one
of
the
best
things
about
venezuelan
oil
was
its
stable
volumes
for
all
these
years
and
competitive
prices
said
one
senior
oil
industry
official
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
supply
situation
but
now
they
seem
in
very
bad
shape
not
having
the
money
to
upgrade
port
facilities
no
money
even
to
remove
the
high
water
content
in
crude
the
officials
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
they
weren
t
authorised
to
discuss
the
matter
with
media
only
one
supertanker
the
new

carrying
million
barrels
of
venezuelan
crude
is
set
to
arrive
in
china
s
eastern
province
of

disruptions
in
venezuelan
crude
supplies
to
china
started
in
april
and
from
through
early
june
pdvsa
did
not
load
any
crude
for
petrochina
said
the
senior
oil
official
the
chinese
firm
lifted
an
average
of
around
million
tonnes

year
or
barrels
a

venezuela
remains
the
biggest
and

visible
casualty
of
the
oil
market
share
war
analysts
at
rbc
capital
markets
led
by
helima
croft
said
in
a
note
on
thursday
we
see
almost
no
prospect
of
a
turnaround
in
the
venezuelan
story
this
year
at
least
barring
a
change
in
government
and
even
if
the
country
comes
under
new
management
it
will
still
take
a
considerable
amount
of
time
and
international
assistance
to
right
the
ship
and
restore
pdvsa
has
halted
operations
at
units
that
convert
oil
into
exportable
crude
early
this
month
it
asked
customers
to
transfer
oil
at
sea
to
clear
a
backlog
of
tankers
waiting
to
load
at
its
ports
the
venezuelan
firm
has
notified
petrochina
of
the
new
requirement
and
agreed
also
to
bear
the
additional
cost
according
to
another
industry
executive
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
one
trader
with
an
independent
chinese
refiner
said
he
was
still
receiving
offers
of
venezuelan
oil
for
august
delivery
at
stable
prices
compared
with
a
month
ago
but
added
that
the
supply
outlook
is
murky
there
isn
t
a
lot
of
cheap
heavy
crude
available
so
some
chinese
refineries
might
have
to
change
diet
a
bit
he
said
sengyick
tee
a
consultant
at
sia
energy
said
chinese
independents
have
increased
imports
of
other
heavy
crude
grades
such
as
castilla
from
colombia
and
fuel
oil
as
replacement

supplier
to
china
last

behind

according

it
already
dropped
