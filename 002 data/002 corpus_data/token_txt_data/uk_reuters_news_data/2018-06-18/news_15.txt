china
s
threat
to
impose
tariffs
on
crude
oil
certain
refined
products
and
coal
is
possibly
the
only
sign
of
clear
thinking
in
the
increasingly
muddled
escalating
trade
dispute
with
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
the
tariffs
on
energy
imports
were
mooted
by
the
chinese
on
june
as
part
of
their
response
to
the
announcement
of
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
imports
to
be
clear
the
tariffs
on
crude
oil
and
products
and
coal
are
still
in
the
realm
of
the
possible
and
it
will
likely
take
a
further
deterioration
in
the
relationship
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
to
turn
them
into
a
reality
it
was
also
curious
that
the
list
of
potential
targets
for
customs
included
natural
gas
in
its
gaseous
form
but
not
as
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
china
imports
zero
gaseous
natural
gas
from
the
united
states
but
is
major
buyer
of
its
lng
the
chinese
threat
to
impose
tariffs
on
energy
imports
makes
sense
from
two
perspectives
the
first
is
that
in
economic
terms
it
s
generally
best
to
put
tariffs
on
goods
with
high
elasticity
in
other
words
goods
you
can
substitute
relatively
easily
from
other
suppliers
the
second
is
that
if
the
aim
of
your
tariffs
is
to
inflict
sufficient
pain
on
the
other
country
it
s
best
to
target
them
where
they
can
do
the
most
damage
to
the
economy
or
the
politicians
promoting
the
trade
war
looking
at
the
first
point
it
s
clear
that
china
would
be
able
to
source
crude
oil
refined
products
and
coal
from
other
countries
even
if
it
had
to
pay
slightly
more
the
chinese
have
become
a
major
buyer
of
crude
importing
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
the
first
five
months
of
the
year
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
oil
research
and
forecasts
this
makes
china
the
biggest
net
buyer
of
crude
canada
imports
more
but
also
exports
to
the
and
therefore
an
important
customer
for
the
booming
shale
industry
with
crude
exports
running
at
about
million
bpd
china
s
purchases
represent
about
percent
of
the
total
however
crude
supplies
to
china
account
for
only
about
percent
of
the
country
s
total
daily
imports
what
this
is
likely
to
mean
is
that
china
will
find
it
easier
to
replace
crude
imports
than
producers
will
to
get
new
customers
it
s
not
hard
to
imagine
a
scenario
whereby
china
encourages
saudi
arabia
and
russia
the
world
s
top
oil
exporters
and
partners
in
the
agreement
to
restrict
output
to
pump
more
crude
china
would
then
buy
the
additional
saudi
and
russian
output
using
it
to
replace
cargoes
from
the
united
states
and
even
from
iran
assuming
the
renewed
sanctions
against
the
islamic
republic
force
beijing
to
curtail
imports
turning
to
coal
the
majority
of
china
s
imports
from
the
united
states
are
coking
coal
used
in
steel
making
supply
of
this
type
of
coal
is
more
concentrated
with
australia
dominating
the
seaborne
market
but
absent
a
disruption
in
australia
it
s
likely
china
could
buy
all
it
needs
without
tapping
supplies
although
this
may
result
in
a
shuffling
among
buyers
for
example
japan
may
buy
more
from
the
united
states
and
less
from
australia
looking
at
natural
gas
and
while
lng
remains
off
the
customs
list
for
the
time
being
the
chinese
could
also
probably
replace
what
they
buy
from
the
united
states
from
other
countries
if
needed
in
the
first
five
months
of
the
year
the
united
states
supplied
about
percent
of
china
s
lng
imports
according
to
data
however
china
bought
about
percent
of
all
lng
exports
meaning
that
china
is
more
important
to
lng
producers
than
they
are
to
the
chinese
by
putting
energy
imports
on
the
agenda
for
tariffs
even
if
lng
is
excluded
so
far
the
chinese
have
put
doubt
in
the
minds
of
investors
thinking
of
putting
capital
into
a
new
lng
project
the
second
leg
to
china
s
threat
is
that
any
tariff
on
energy
imports
will
strike
at
the
heart
of
president
trump
s
support
base
coal
miners
count
among
trump
s
most
vocal
backers
but
if
china
does
stop
buying
coking
coal
it
may
force
producers
to
accept
lower
prices
from
other
buyers
in
order
to
move
cargoes
the
oil
and
natural
gas
industries
have
also
been
viewed
as
largely
in
trump
s
corner
and
they
are
concentrated
in
states
won
by
the
former
reality
television
star
in
his
unexpected
triumph
losing
as
big
a
buyer
as
china
may
force
producers
to
accept
lower
prices
or
even
reduce
output
energy
is
also
one
of
the
few
areas
where
the
chinese
have
genuine
scope
to
increase
purchases
from
the
united
states
thereby
making
it
key
to
any
efforts
to
lower
the
trade
surplus
china
has
with
the
united
states
flagging
energy
imports
as
a
possible
target
in
the
current
trade
skirmish
comes
across
as
a
sign
that
beijing
is
entirely
serious
about
engaging
in
a
escalation
with
trump
the
chinese
have
probably
calculated
that
they
can
take
the
pain
from
a
trade
conflict
longer
than
trump
can
or
at
least
longer
than
the
economy
companies
and
workers
will
be
prepared
to
tolerate
