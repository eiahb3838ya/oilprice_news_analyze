prompting

to

fears
of

suggesting

the
possible
global
trade
war
is
looking
to
be
back
on
again
as
the
and
china
announced
tariffs
on
each
other
s
imports
said
nick
twidale
analyst
at
rakuten
securities
australia
this
looks
set
to
be
the
main
theme
that
investors
will
focus
on
with
any
further
escalation
in
tension
adding
to
the
downside
trump
announced
hefty
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
imports
on
friday
laying
out
a
list
of
more
than
strategically
important
imports
from
china
that
would
be
subject
to
a
percent
tariff
starting
on
july
including
cars
china
said
it
would
respond
with
tariffs
of
the
same
scale
and
strength
and
that
any
previous
trade
deals
with
trump
were
the
official
xinhua
news
agency
said
china
would
impose
percent
tariffs
on
products
ranging
from
soybeans
and
autos
to
seafood
china
s
retaliation
list
was
increased
more
than
from
a
version
released
in
april
but
the
value
was
kept
at
billion
as
some
items
such
as
commercial
aircraft
were
deleted
however
many
market
watchers
believe
there
is
still
room
for
compromise
suspecting
trump
s
announcement
was
a
negotiating
tactic
to
wring
faster
concessions
from
beijing
analysts
say
the
direct
impact
of
the
tariffs
may
be
limited
especially
for
the
economy
which
is
in
strong
shape
but
asia
s
other
economies
and
companies
plugged
into
china
s
supply
chains
are
worried
they
will
suffer
collateral
damage
if
world
trade
slows
down
hurting
global
growth
and
dampening
business
confidence
shares
of
japanese
construction
equipment
makers
komatsu
ltd
and
hitachi
construction
machinery
tumbled
percent
and
percent
respectively
both
are
vulnerable
to
any
downturns
in
chinese
and
global
capital
spending
there
are
trade
frictions
not
only
between
the
and
china
but
also
between
the
and
its
allies
trump
could
put
more
pressure
on
other
countries
like
japan
and
nato
courtiers
said
yoshinori
shigemi
global
market
strategist
at
jpmorgan
asset
management
in
tokyo
so
far
investors
have
been
escaping
to
shares
and
small
cap
shares
after
all
money
is
still
abundant
but
investors
should
be
in
the
currency
market
the
dollar
was
supported
for
now
as
the
euro
has
lost
steam
after
the
european
central
bank
had
suggested
on
thursday
it
would
hold
off
raising
interest
rates
through
the
summer
of
next
year
the
euro
traded
at
not
far
from
a
low
of
set
on
friday
the
dollar
eased
to
yen
having
hit
a
high
of

friday
the
japanese
currency
stayed
resilient
following

deadly

that
struck

including
osaka

the
australian
dollar

risk
slipped
to
a
trough
while
its
new
zealand
cousin
fell
to
the
lowest
since
oil
prices
were
under
pressure
on
fears
of
increased
supply
as
two
big
producers
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
indicated
they
were
prepared
to
increase
output
