global
stocks
slid
on
monday
and
oil
prices
slumped
after
president
donald
trump
announced
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
and
beijing
responded
with
similar
measures
in
an
escalating
trade
dispute
fears
the
spat
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
could
intensify
added
to
pressure
on
oil
prices
which
extended
friday
s
big
fall
into
the
start
of

while
the
dollar
retreated
from
near
highs
against
the
yen
trump
announced
tariffs
on
friday
on
billion
of
chinese
imports
including
cars
starting
on
july
china
said
it
would
retaliate
immediately
by
slapping
duties
on
american
export
products
including
crude
oil
and
suspend
all
previous
trade
agreements
with
trump
s
administration
the
exchange
of
blows
between
beijing
and
washington
has
heightened
fears
of
a
broader
and
more
protracted
dispute
sending
asian
shares
to
a
week
low
european

opened
lower
as
investor
angst
about
the
outlook
for
economic
growth
filtered
through
to
european
stocks
the
stoxx
slipped
percent
and
germany
s
dax
was
down
percent
while
france
s
cac
declined
percent
this
all
shows
how
quickly
trade
tensions
could
escalate
between
the
and
china
said
derek
halpenny
european
head
of
global
markets
research
at
mufg
bank
this
may
not
be
the
end
of
the
matter
as
officials
are
looking
at
another
billion
of
chinese
imports
on
which
they
could
impose
tariffs
if
desired
he
said
a
potentially
destabilising
vote
in
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
governing
coalition
partner
over
a

put

crude
futures
fell
to
a
low
of
a
barrel
on
monday
on
worries
about
a
hit
to
global
growth
from
the
trade
dispute
and
after
reports
that
top
suppliers
saudi
arabia
and
russia
would
likely
agree
to
increase
production
at
the
june

meeting
in

light

hit
a
low

edging

by

the

of
the

of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
which
is
de

led
by
saudi
arabia
and
some
allies

been
restricting

the

policy
china
has
hiked
its
list
of
goods
on
which
it
said
it
would
slap
tariffs
from
a
version
released
in
april
but
the
value
was
kept
at
billion
as
some
items
such
as
commercial
aircraft
were
deleted
some
analysts
however
believe
there
is
still
room
for
compromise
suspecting
trump
s
announcement
was
a
negotiating
tactic
to
wring
faster
concessions
from
beijing
analysts
also
say
the
direct
impact
of
the
tariffs
may
be
limited
especially
for
the
economy
which
is
in
decent
shape
the
immediate
fallout
from
the
dispute
was
limited
in
currency
markets
a
mild
reaction
in
the
dollar
suggested
that
the
exchange
of
blows
was
anticipated
in
some
markets
the
dollar
index
versus
a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
crept
up
percent
to
the
index
was
close
to
a
peak
scaled
on
friday
thanks
to
the
dollar
soaring
more
than
percent
last
week
after
the
federal
reserve
gave
a
hawkish
signal
on
interest
rates
while
the
european
central
bank
struck
a
dovish
tone
the
euro
traded
at
not
far
from
a
recent
low
of
after
the
european
central
bank
suggested
it
would
hold
off
raising
interest
rates
through
the
summer
of
next
year
the
australian
dollar
a
liquid
hedge
for
risk
slipped
to
a
trough
while
its
new
zealand
cousin
fell
to
the
lowest
since
asian
economies
and
companies
plugged
into
china
s
supply
chains
are
worried
that
they
will
suffer
collateral
damage
if
world
trade
slows
down
hurting
global
growth
and
dampening
business
confidence
there
are
trade
frictions
not
only
between
the
and
china
but
also
between
the
and
its
allies
trump
could
put
more
pressure
on
other
countries
like
japan
and
nato
courtiers
said
yoshinori

so
far
investors
have
been
escaping
