is
europe
s
economy
merely
encountering
a
soft
spot
or
entering
a
more
lasting
decline
bank
of
england
policymakers
are
likely
to
debate
this
question
in
the
week
ahead
while
data
from
the
euro
zone
will
indicate
whether
european
central
bank
president
mario
draghi
is
right
to
refer
to
current
conditions
simply
as
a
soft
patch
a
cold
snap
from
february
into
march
later
easter
holidays
than
usual
and
strikes
took
their
toll
in
the
first
quarter
but
hard
data
since
have
not
pointed
to
a
clear
rebound
in
announcing
an
end
to
bond
purchases
by
the
end
of
the
year
draghi
said
such
softness
could
last
longer
than
currently
projected
by
ecb
economists
in
some
countries
for
example
it
is
foreseen
that
it
may
extend
into
the
second
quarter
he
said
while
adding
the
underlying
strength
of
the
economy
did
not
appear
changed
albeit
with
greater
uncertainty
such
as
over
global
trade
peter
vanden
houte
chief
euro
zone
economist
at
ing
said
markets
were
very
much
looking
for
news
to
test
the
ecb
s
idea
that
the
economy
would
grow
at
a
satisfactory
pace
in
the
second
quarter
and
possibly
even
accelerate
afterwards
this
is
still
in
doubt
because
you
might
also
have
a
further
deceleration
of
the
economy
that
will
remain
very
much
in
the
mind
of
traders
and
economists
he
said
belgian
central
bank
chief
jan
smets
an
ecb
governing
council
member
said
an
improving
labour
market
with
income
gains
and
accommodating
monetary
policy
were
foundations
for
growth
in
the
coming
years
that
can
not
make
us
blind
that
especially
in
the
global
environment
there
are
prominent
risks
which
may
even
have
increased
one
is
the
protectionist
measures
which
i
regret
he
said
draghi
may
also
return
to
this
issue
at
the
ecb
forum
on
central
banking
in
portugal
he
gives
a
speech
on
tuesday
and
appears
on
a
panel
the
day
after
with
federal
reserve
chairman
jerome
powell
bank
of
japan
governor
haruhiko
kuroda
and
reserve
bank
of
australia
head
philip
lowe
survey
data
on
thursday
and
friday
may
then
provide
some
answers
the
euro
zone
flash
estimate
for
consumer
confidence
on
june
is
forecast
to
decline
for
a
second
consecutive
month
with
the
index
turning
negative
for
the
first
time
since
october
on
friday
ihs
markit
s
composite
flash
purchasing
managers
index
pmi
for
the
euro
zone
seen
as
a
good
guide
to
overall
economic
health
is
seen
unchanged
however
this
would
match
an
low
and
with
the
manufacturing
component
expected
to
fall
for
a
sixth
straight
month
these
are
the
first
figures
that
will
actually
show
what
has
been
the
impact
of
italy
vanden
houte
said
referring
to
italy
s
new
government
of
parties
they
will
also
be
the
first
survey
data
since
president
donald
trump
made
eu
steel
and
aluminium
subject
to
import
tariffs
draghi
said
on
thursday
that
the
impact
in
europe
of
tariffs
was
limited
to
date
but
a
series
of
measures
could
particularly
hit
confidence
with
political
uncertainty
in
germany
too
it
is
only
a
dip
in
oil
prices
after
an
upward
march
of
months
that
has
really
provided
some
comfort
the
organization
of
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
russia
and
other
producers
meet
in
vienna
from
friday
and
could
agree
to
increase
production
from
july
in
britain
the
bank
of
england
boe
is
expected
to
keep
interest
rates
on
hold
but
the
focus
will
be
on
indications
for
its
following
meeting
in
august
when
markets
put
the
chance
of
a
hike
at
about
percent
the
chances
of
a
rate
increase
were
pegged
back
in
the
past
week
by
softer
than
expected
manufacturing
earnings
and
inflation
data
its
announcement
will
come
on
thursday
with
no

conference
though
boe
governor
mark
carney
will
deliver
a
speech
at
the
annual
banker
s
dinner
at
london
s
mansion
house
that
evening
the

has
said
it
wants
to
be
sure
the

has
recovered
from
in
an
unusually
cold
early
before
pushing
ahead
with
only
its
second
rate
hike
since
before
the
global
financial
crisis
in
the
united
states
there
is
little
on
the
economic
front
to
occupy
markets
a
week
after
the
federal
reserve
increased
interest
rates
for
the
second
time
this
year
and
signalled
more
to
come
the
global
trade
war
could
though
ramp
up
a
notch
after
trump
announced
new
tariffs
of
billion
of
chinese
imports
and
beijing
threatened
to
respond
