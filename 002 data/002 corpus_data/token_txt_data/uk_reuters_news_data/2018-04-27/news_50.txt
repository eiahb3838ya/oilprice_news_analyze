china
s
natural
gas
producers
have
been
told
to
sign
annual
supply
contracts
with
major
users
by
the
end
of
this
month
a
senior
planning
official
said
on
friday
as
the
country
seeks
to
avoid
a
repeat
of
this
winter
s
severe
gas
shortages
freezing
weather
and
a
sweeping
campaign
to
switch
millions
of
homes
and
businesses
from
coal
to
natural
gas
to
tackle
smog
led
to
a
supply
crunch
earlier
this
year
supplies
were
cut
to
some
industrial
users
as
authorities
prioritised
households
we
remain
under
big
pressure
to
ensure
sufficient
supplies
this
winter
we
shall
have
more
adequate
preparations

of
the
bureau
of

the

and
reform
commission
ndrc
demand
for
gas
is
expected
to
grow
strongly
this
year
as
beijing
promotes
the
fuel
and
the
economy
improves
zhao
told
a
media
briefing
china
s
gas
demand
grew
by
nearly
percent
in
the
first
quarter
of
to
billion
cubic
meters
from
a
year
earlier
following
a
percent
jump
for
the
full
year
of
zhao
said
the
annual
contracts
should
include
details
of
any
supply
cuts
for
major
users
during
the
peak
winter
heating
season
which
runs
from
to
stipulating
the
duration
of
such
cuts
and
the
volume
to
be
reduced
during
periods
of
emergency
situations
the
additional
cost
of
gas
supply
would
be
borne
by
either
the
buyer
whose
demand
is
above
the
contracted
amount
or
the
supplier
who
provides
less
than
the
contracted
volumes
the
ndrc
said
in
a
separate
statement
released
later
on
friday
china
has
already
pledged
to
build
more
gas
pipelines
and
storage
facilities
to
help
ensure
adequate
gas
supplies
in
the
future
ndrc
officials
said
on
friday
that
gas
suppliers
mainly
companies
like
china
national
petroleum
corp
sinopec
group
and
china
national
offshore
oil
corp
will
be
required
to
have
storage
facilities
able
to
meet
at
least
percent
of
their
contracted
sales
by
local
authorities
will
need
to
have
sufficient
storage
to
cover
three
days
of
consumption
in
their
administrative
regions
and
city
gas
distributors
must
have
storage
equal
to
percent
of
their
annual
supplies
within
the
same
time
frame
for
local
gas
distributors
who
fail
to
meet
the
storage
obligations
or
refuse
to
sign
up
supply
contracts
they
risk
losing
their
business
licenses
the
ndrc
said
pricing
will
also
be
introduced
to
boost
investment
in
the
sector
the
ndrc
officials
said
the
government
is
also
encouraging
the
trading
of
gas
storage
capacity
on
gas
exchanges
in
the
cities
of
shanghai
and
chongqing
the
ndrc
said
in
the
later
statement
in
areas
where
there
is
wide
price
discrepancies
between
and
seasons
a
special
pricing
policy
will
apply
to
retail
users
to
even
out
the
cost
throughout
the
year
the
statement
said
china
operates
gas
storage
facilities
with
a
total
working
volume
of
billion
cubic
metres
equal
to
less
than
percent
of
the
country
s
gas
consumption
this
is
well
below
the
percent
mark
for
top
gas
consumers
such
as
the
united
states
and
russia
industry
analysts
have
said
china
s
regulated
gas
pricing
and
in
key
distribution
infrastructure
are
hurdles
to
future
growth
