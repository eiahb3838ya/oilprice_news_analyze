brent
has
risen
by
around
percent
so
far
this
month
while
wti
was
on
track
for
a
gain
of
nearly
percent
the
gains
came
despite
a
higher
dollar
which
hit
its
strongest
since
against
a
basket

a
stronger
dollar
makes
commodities
more
expensive
for
holders

concerns
about
market
tightness
have
also
been
fuelled
by
the
deteriorating
political
and
economic
situation
in
venezuela
that
has
led
to
a
