that
refining

especially
outside
the
united
states
clipped
improved

strength
in
the
chevron
division
that

both
exxon
and

rising
oil
prices
typically
harm
refiners
by
squeezing
their
margins
on
products
but
they
also
boost
profit
at
divisions
that
produce
crude
the
strategy
worked
for
chevron
during
the
quarter
helping
the
company
top

expectations
at
exxon
weak
refining
results
were
coupled
with

both

reuters
reported
earlier
this

asked

exxon
s
production
swung
to
a
million
profit
from
a
loss
but
exxon
has
continued
to
invest
heavily
in
projects
that
will
not
produce
oil
or
gas
for
years
in
contrast
chevron
is
benefiting
from
past
investments
that
have
boosted
output
especially
in
liquefied
natural
gas
exxon
also
has
struggled
in
the
past
months
to
unwind
some
of
the
biggest
bets
taken
by
former
ceo
rex
tillerson
who
left
to
become
secretary
of
state
in
early
before
being
fired
by
president
donald
trump
last
month
the
exxon
strategy
right
now
is
not
what
the
market
wants
said
mark
stoeckle
portfolio
manager
of
adams
natural
resources
fund
which
holds
exxon
shares
the
market
wants
the
cash
back
they
want
what
exxon
can
t
give
them
today
because
of
the
mismatch
between
investment
and
exxon
and
chevron
told
investors
on
friday
that
it
was
too
soon
to
begin
buying
