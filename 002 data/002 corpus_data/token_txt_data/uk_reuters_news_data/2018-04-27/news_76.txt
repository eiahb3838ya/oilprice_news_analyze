wants

germany
s
angela
merkel
visits
president
donald
trump
on
friday
with
no
illusions
of
matching
his
special
relationship
with
france
s
emmanuel
macron
but
hoping
to
foster
a
broader
dialogue
on
trade
one
of
a
batch
of
tricky
topics
likely
to
be
addressed
the
cautious
merkel
has
failed
to
establish
a
good
personal
rapport
with
the
brash
trump
and
the
mood
music
of
her
working
visit
to
the
white
house
will
almost
certainly
contrast
sharply
with
the
tactile
bromance
between
trump
and
macron
yet
her
trip
may
prove
more
productive
before
heading
home
after
a
state
visit
in
washington
macron
acknowledged
that
despite
his
efforts
to
dissuade
trump
from
pulling
out
of
the
multinational
iran
nuclear
deal
he
remained
likely
to
do
so
the
iran
deal
looming
tariffs
on
european
steel
and
aluminium
products
a
planned
russian
gas
pipeline
running
under
the
baltic
sea
to
germany
and
berlin
s
military
spending
are
issues
that
divide
merkel
and
trump
and
likely
to
come
up
at
their
working
lunch
the
chancellor
is
pleased
about
this
appointment
because
she
is
a
convinced
atlanticist
a
senior
german
official
said
it
is
important
to
cultivate
this
in
washington
a
white
house
official
described
germany
as
one
of
the
united
states
closest
partners
and
a
steadfast
nato
ally
adding
all
of
washington
is
ready
to
work
with
chancellor
merkel
s
new
ahead
of
the
trip
german
officials
said
they
expected
tariffs
on
european
steel
and
aluminium
products
to
kick
in
on
may
when
an
exemption
expires
but
they
said
germany
would
try
to
negotiate
a
broad
package
including
other
industries
i
think
the
chancellor
would
prefer
a
broad
dialogue
with
the
americans
the
government
is
open
to
extending
the
package
to
other
duties
and
trade
barriers
one
official
added
in
washington
a
white
house
official
said
the
united
states
would
press
germany
about
trade
deficits
that
pose
risks
to
global
economic
stability
and
would
like
to
remove
barriers
to
trade
so
that
we
can
level
the
playing
field
we
want
to
work
with
berlin
on
global
unfair
trading
practices
because
those
are
impacting
our
economies
in
equal
measure
he
said
the
white
house
official
said
trump
would
press
merkel
to
increase
germany
s
funding
for
nato
a
subject
he
has
pushed
since
taking
office
we
will
ask
germany
to
step
up
on
the
official
said
adding
that
nato
needed
to
be
strong
and
prepared
to
address
a
host
of
major
foreign
policy
issues
including
syria
iran
china
and
russia
in
berlin
the
german
officials
made
clear
that
merkel
was
not
ready
to
roll
over
when
faced
with
trump
s
criticism
of
germany
s
trade
position
or
the
planned
nord
stream
pipeline
our
analysis
is
that
the
pipeline
does
not
make
us
more
dependent
on
russia
one
of
the
officials
said
eu
countries
are
divided
on
the
merits
of
nord
stream
trump
could
seize
on
this
as
well
as
germany
s
slow
progress
in
moving
closer
to
the
nato
defence
spending
target
on
iran
macron
made
the
running
ahead
of
merkel
s
visit
on
wednesday
he
called
on
the
united
states
not
to
abandon
the
iran
deal
as
western
envoys
said
britain
france
and
germany
were
nearing
agreeing
a
package
they
hope
could
persuade
trump
to
save
the
pact
this
gives
merkel
something
to
work
with
how
harshly
the
whole
thing
will
unfold
might
depend
on
to
what
extent
merkel
can
steer
the
conversation
in
the
direction
of
trade
and
iran
jan
techau
a
director
at
the
german
marshall
fund
of
the
united
states
those
are
the
fields
in
which
her
position
is
stronger
because
the
europeans
are
united
and
macron
has
done
the
prep
