the

and
no

woefully
inadequate

european
union
states
have
submitted
documents
to
the
united
nations
in
recent
weeks
about
the
state
of
global
climate

one
recurrent

that

pace

increase
dramatically

immediately

avoid
dangerous
climate
change

they
are
suffering
ever
more
from
rising
sea
levels
and
storm
surges
whipped
up
by
cyclones
they
say
there
is
too
much
and
too
little
action
if
we
spent
as
much
time
working
on
this
problem
as
we
do
congratulating
ourselves
for
caring
so
deeply
about
it
we
