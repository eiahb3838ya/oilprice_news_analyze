talks
on
friday
to
defuse
a
political
crisis
engulfing
the

armenia
a
close
ally
of
russia
has
been
rocked
by
two
weeks
of
protests
against
the
ruling
elite
which
led
on

to
the
resignation
of
serzh
sarksyan
as
prime
minister
sarksyan
had
previously
been
president
for
a
decade
his
resignation
has
failed
to
halt
the
protesters
who
say
they
consider
the
whole
government
tainted
by
sarksyan
s
drive
to
shift
power
to
the
prime
minister
from
the
president
they
want
pashinyan
installed
as
interim

and
then
for
early
parliamentary
polls
to
take
place
under
a
new
election
law
the
acting
prime
minister
considers
taking
part
in
talks
that
have
no
chance
of
finding
a
solution
to
be
useless
karapetyan
s
press
service
said
in
a
statement
karapetyan
is
an
ally
of
sarksyan
and
a
member
of
his
ruling
republican
party
karapetyan
later
accused
the
opposition
of
monopolising
the
political
process
and
said
only
genuine
dialogue
and
an
acknowledgement
of
mistakes
could
defuse
the
crisis
we
should
understand
which
political
force
or
forces
will
lead
the
country
to
a
better
future
karapetyan
told
independent
television
channel
shant
tv
we
should
support
a
programme
rather
than
just
elect
a
pashinyan
who
has
led
the
daily
street
protests
said
karapetyan
was
repeating
sarksyan
s
mistakes
and
said
the
demonstrations
would
continue
protesters
held
a
rally
on
friday
in
gyumri
armenia
s
second
biggest
city
and
plan
to
hold
another
outside
the
capital
on
saturday
before
resuming
protests
in
yerevan
from
sunday
thousands
of
people
greeted
pashinyan
s
cortege
and
chanted
his
name
along
the
road
from
yerevan
to
gyumri
in
some
villages
he
met
local
residents
who
hugged
and
kissed
the
former
journalist
turned
lawmaker
pashinyan
said
the
opposition
would
probably
boycott
any
snap
parliamentary
election
unless
parliament
made
him
the
interim
prime
minister
we
want
a
guarantee
that
such
an
election
would
be
really
free
really
transparent
and
really
democratic
pashinyan
said
otherwise
this
vote
would
not
have
any
i
m
calling
on
the
citizens
of
armenia
to
go
out
to
the
streets
from
early
morning
on
may
and
to
flood
all
streets
and
squares
including
around
the
national
assembly
parliament
pashinyan
added
parliament
is
due
to
pick
a
new
prime
minister
on
may
although
the
demonstrations
have
been
peaceful
the
upheaval
has
threatened
to
destabilise
armenia
in
a
volatile
region
riven
by
the
country
s
conflict
with
neighbouring
azerbaijan
pashinyan
has
not
questioned
armenia
s
geopolitical
alignment
with
russia
under
sarksyan
and
his
criticism
has
focussed
on
domestic
issues
such
as
corruption
and
poverty
on
friday
the
kremlin
said
it
hoped
the
political
crisis
in
armenia
could
be
resolved
as
promptly
as
possible
and
with
the
consensus
of
all
parties
involved
moscow
has
two
military
bases
in
the
republic
russian
president
vladimir
putin
spoke
on
thursday
to
karapetyan
a
former
executive
of
russian
gas
giant
gazprom
and
made
clear
that
moscow
was
watching
events
closely
and
did
not
want
mob
rule
in
armenia
the
kremlin
said
the
kremlin
statement
appeared
to
suggest
that
putin
wanted
armenia
s
next
prime
minister
to
come
from
the
ruling
party
which
has
been
the
focus
of
popular
anger
saying
he
thought
the
crisis
needed
to
be
addressed
on
the
basis
of
what
he
said
were
legitimate
parliamentary
elections
in
one
political
analyst
said
the
kremlin
had
clearly
endorsed
karapetyan
as
its
preferred
candidate
to
head
the
next
government
it
is
a
direct
challenge
to
the
opposition
and
a
move
to
safeguard
the
position
of
the
embattled
and
deeply
unpopular
ruling
elite
it
is
also
a
flagrant
rejection
of
the
new
political
reality
in
armenia
