analysis-strong asian demand continues to hold up thermal coal markets

asian
thermal
coal
demand
is
defying
its
typical
seasonal
slowdown
as
well
as
the
expanding
use
of
renewables
and
natural
gas
with
prices
holding
not
far
off
a
tonne
despite
the
onset
of
the
usual
lull
at
this

of

benchmark
australian
thermal
coal
prices
are
at
a
tonne
their
highest
seasonal
level
in
five
years
and
per

above
the
average
price
coal
s
strength
is
also
visible
in
the
derivatives
market
where
coal
futures
are
at
around
a
tonne
around
percent
higher
than
in
april
the
firm
prices
are
due
to
robust
use
in
india
japan
south
korea
and
even
china
where
coal
consumption
has
held
up
despite
huge
programmes
to
boost
the
use
of
gas
and
renewable
energy
coal
demand
for
the
coming
two
years
is
expected
to
remain
stable
around
current
levels
although
headlines
in
the
newspapers
may
suggest
that
coal
demand
will
peak
soon
in
reality
demand
will
remain
solid
in
the
coming
years

thermal
coal
remains
the
fuel
for
power
generation
globally
especially
in
asia
which
uses
more
than
percent
of
the
world
s
thermal
coal
up
from
under
percent
in
according
to
bp
s
latest
statistical
review
of
the
world
the
strong
demand
comes
despite
coal
s
image
as
a
dirty
fuel
which
has
left
it
increasingly
shunned
by
many
investors
however
cashing
in
on
strong
demand
have
been
specialist

like

thermal
coal
is
probably
one
of
the
most
hated
asset
classes
globally
but
if
you
look
at
demand
it
s
roughly
flat

is
leading
to
lower

coal
use

to
one
of
the
surprises
over
the
past
year
has
been
china
where
many
analysts
expected
a
decline
in
coal
demand
due
to
its
drive
to
use
more
renewables
and
move
millions
of
households
to
use
natural

for

china
s
plans
to
switch
to
cleaner

has
led
to
a
gradual

consumption

and
demand
for
coal
is
still
firm

many
power
stations
and
industrial
facilities
still
rely
on
the
commodity

utilities

the
lunar
new

prompted
a
percent
jump
in
coal
imports
in
march
from
a
year
earlier
customs
data
showed
however
several
ports
in
china
have
introduced
restrictions
on
coal
imports
as
the
government
tries
to
support
domestic
coal
prices
and
encourage
more
local
production
it
is
unclear
how
long
the
restrictions
will
last
and
whether
they
will
reduce
demand
but
they
are
unlikely
to
affect
australian
or
russian
exports
of
coal
which
are
grades
coal
production
in
china
dropped
sharply
in
due
to
the
new
year
holiday
but
we
expect
output
to
rise
this
year
as
lower
imports
boost
demand
for
domestic
coal

further
interventions
by

side
are
