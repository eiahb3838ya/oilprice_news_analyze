some
of
china
s
top
refineries
will
shut
in
may
and
june
for
maintenance
cutting
nationwide

by
some

dampening

in
the
world
s
largest
crude
importer
after
record
run
levels
in
march
according
to
a
reuters
survey
at
least
six
and
private
refiners
are
planning
a
full
annual
maintenance
shutdown
in
the
second
quarter
for
days
or
more
including
china
s
largest
refiner
sinopec
s
zhenhai
unit
a
reuters
survey
of
plants
showed
a
slowdown
in
china
s
refining
activity
could
result
in
lower
chinese
imports
of
crude
oil
which
in
turn
could
undercut
a
price
rally
that
has
lifted
crude
to
more
than
a
barrel
for
the
first
time
in
over
three
years
analysts
and
traders
say
imports
may
also
be
disrupted
by
a
shutdown
of
major

import
hub
huangdao
part
of
qingdao
port
in
northern
shandong
province
further
crimping
consumption
if
shandong
prepares
to
shut
down
the
huangdao
port
crude
arrivals
could
start
dropping
starting
in

may
said
emma
li
senior
analyst
at
thomson
reuters
oil
research
port
authorities
declined
to
comment
on
what
measures
they
might
take
ahead
the
shanghai
cooperation
organization
summit
in
qingdao
in
june
qingdao
is
a
major
commodities
port
and
beijing
usually
adopts
tighter
pollution
controls
and
curbs

traffic

ensure

to

for

of
china
s

monthly
crude

reuters
calculations
based
on
refinery
rates
from
china
s
statistics
bureau
showed
the
pace
of
outages
due
to
maintenance
is
down
from
million
bpd
in
the
same
period
last
year
reuters
calculations
also
showed
but
the
actual
volume
of
outages
could
grow
as
a
flurry
of
independent
refineries
are
considering
undertaking
maintenance
in
june
and
early
july
to
avoid
the
potential
pollution
curbs
the
early
start
could
prolong
china
s
annual
maintenance
season
independent
refiners
often
known
as
teapots
typically
carry
out
their
routine
repairs
later
in
the
summer
usually
the
maintenance
period
falls
in
july
and
august
but
this
year
we
are
planning
one
in
june
a
crude
purchasing
manager
with
a
refiner
said
the
outages
and
potential
slowdown
in
demand
will
likely
put
brakes
on
china
s
voracious
appetite
for
crude
oil
as
refineries
have
been
churning
out
fuel
at
a
record
pace
to
take
advantage
of
bumper
profit
margins
trade
data
in
thomson
reuters
eikon
shows
china
will
likely
take
in
more
than
million
bpd
of
crude
in
april
its
most
ever
some
of
those
arrivals
are
from
march
due
to
a
backlog
at
qingdao
li
said
and
some
private
refiners
might
have
already
bought
more
to
prepare
for
any
disruption
at
the
port
crude
arrivals
in
may
fell
more
than
percent
from
april
last
year
due
to
chinese
refiners
maintenance
plans
further
denting
forward
crude
demand
is
that
many
of
the
teapot
refiners
including
tianhong
chemical
and
haiyou
will
undertake
maintenance
this
year
shandong
haike
group
will
also
close
for
the
whole
of
june
an
official
at
the
plant
told
reuters
and
another
ten
private
refiners
will
shut
between

june
