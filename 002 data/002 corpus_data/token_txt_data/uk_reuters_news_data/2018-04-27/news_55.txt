india
plans
to
split
gas
utility
gail
by
march
next
year
to
create
two
companies
one
marketing
gas
and
another
operating
pipelines
that
can
be
used
by
consumers
who
buy
direct
from
producers
the
head
of
the
sector
s
regulator
told
reuters
gail
india
ltd
is
the
country
s
biggest
gas
marketing
and
trading
firm
and
owns
most
of
the
nation
s
pipelines
giving
it
a
stranglehold
on
the
market
for
the
fuel
by
splitting
gail
the
regulator
of
india
s
oil
and
gas
sector
hopes
to
increase
the
number
of
gas
consumers
and
attract
the
billions
of
dollars
needed
to
expand
the
pipeline
network
and
build
more
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
terminals
all
this
should
be
done
within
this
fiscal
year
to
march
sarraf
chairman
of
india
s
petroleum
and
natural
gas
board
told
reuters
gail
already
keeps
separate
accounts
for
its
gas
pipeline
and
marketing
businesses
making
it
easier
to
split
them
into
two
entities
before
a
change
of
ownership
he
said
sarraf
did
not
say
which
business
gail
would
retain
india
s
oil
minister
dharmendra
pradhan
in
january
said
the
company
should
focus
on
laying
pipelines
suggesting
it
is
the
marketing
side
that
would
be
hived
off
by
unbundling
gail
and
opening
the
sector
the
government
hopes
to
increase
gas
use
and
meet
its
objective
of
raising
the
share
of
a
cleaner
cheaper
fuel
as
a
part
of
the
energy
mix
to
percent
from
percent
in
the
next
years
many
power
plants
and
small
industries
like
ceramic
glass
and
cement
makers
rely
heavily
on
more
expensive
or
dirtier
fuels
such
as
naphtha
diesel
and
coal
in
future
though
even
small
companies
will
be
able
to
buy
gas
via
pipelines
without
having
to
go
through
gail
only
a
handful
of
companies
including
petronet
lng
ltd
indian
oil
corp
ltd
and
gujarat
state
petroleum
corp
currently
import
and
sell
gas
in
india
the
gas
regulator
hopes
by
july
however
to
draft
norms
for
allowing
to
bid
for
using
lng
terminals
to
import
gas
we
are
planning
to
put
lng
terminals
on
public
access
to
the
extent
of
percent
sarraf
said
the
regulator
was
also
looking
at
how
to
open
access
to
the
pipeline
network
for
smaller
buyers
india
s
gas
demand
is
constrained
by
low
domestic
output
a
small
number
of
lng
terminals
just
four
and
a
pipeline
network
that
does
not
reach
enough
customers
gail
owns
more
than
of
india
s
existing
km
miles
of
pipelines
but
the
government
wants
to
more
than
double
the
network
to
expand
gas
deliveries
while
the
new
pipeline
company
created
by
the
division
of
gail
would
be
expected
to
lead
the
way
the
government
also
wants
other
companies
to
bid
for
rights
to
build
and
operate
pipelines
three
lng
import
facilities
are
also
under
construction
and
there
are
proposals
for
many
more
domestic
gas
production
is
also
expected
to
rise
sarraf
estimated
an
investment
of
nearly
billion
would
be
needed
over
the
next
several
years
for
laying
pipelines
only
the
western
state
of
gujarat
has
an
extensive
city
gas
distribution
network
though
some
other
major
cities
including
new
delhi
and
mumbai
have
been
hooked
up
to
gas
