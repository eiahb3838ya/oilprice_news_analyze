to
innogy
shareholders
for
and
shareholders

until

rwe
and
in
march
unveiled
comprehensive
plans
to
break
up
innogy

divide
its
assets
turning
rwe
into
europe
s
wind
utility
and
into
europe
s
largest
operator

and
power
networks
but
other
investors
are
looking
to
muscle
in
on
the
deal
last
week
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
that
australia
s
macquarie
was
interested
in
buying
some
of
innogy
s
assets
including
the
stake
in
a
czech
gas
networks
unit
it
does
not
already
own
on
friday
czech
investment
group
kkcg
which
has
interests
in
gas
extraction
and
storage
said
it
also
planned
to
make
a
bid
for
innogy
s
czech
assets
which
include
a
gas
distribution
network
storage
facilities
and
gas
and
electricity
trading
kkcg
said
that
needn
t
disrupt
rwe
s
and
s
plans
a
potential
sale
of
innogy
s
czech
activities
is
in
line
with
an
earlier
agreement
on
the
split
of
innogy
that
the
parent
rwe
concluded
last
month
with
its
competitor
kkcg
said
in
a
statement
however
rwe
and
don
t
seem
keen
on
any
side
deals
said
in
its
offer
document
that
rwe
would
offer
to
buy
innogy
s
stake
in
czech
innogy
grid
holding
which
would
then
have
an
option
to
buy
and
s
finance
chief
told
reuters
he
believed
his
firm
would
end
up
owning
the
czech
operations
we
are
very
interested
in
integrating
innogy
in
its
entirety
and
that
includes
the
czech
gas
business
i
am
confident
that
the
czech
gas
business
will
eventually
find
its
way
to
provisions
have
been
made
in
our
contracts
for
this
marc
spieker
told
reuters
innogy
and
declined
to
comment
on
kkcg
s
statement
innogy
s
management
and
supervisory
boards
will
publish
their
recommendations
on
s
offer
within
the
next
two
weeks
they
have
urged
shareholders
not
to
take
any
action
until
then
innogy
s
shares
closed
little
changed
at
euros
the
deal
expected
to
close
in
late
is
seen
resulting
in
as
many
as
job
cuts
as
targets
million
euros
in
synergies
boss
johannes
teyssen
has
said
he
hopes
job
reductions
can
be
done
without
forced
redundancies
