mpla
party
said
on

joao
lourenco
to
become
head
of
the
party
replacing
his
predecessor
as
head
of
state
jose
eduardo
dos
santos
the
move
coincided
with
an
announcement
by
angola
s
billion
sovereign
wealth
fund
that
it
was
sacking
quantum
global
as
its
asset
manager
because
it
was
concerned
about
the
way
its
capital
was
being
invested
both
developments
will
further
cement
the
political
grip
of
lourenco
who
has
taken
action
against
dos
santos
allies
and
removed
family
members
from
key
positions
while
pledging
to
root
out
endemic
corruption
and
clean
up
public
finances
in
africa
s
no
crude
producer
dos
santos
son
jose

has
also
overseen
the
sacking
of
his
daughter
isabel

oil
company
sonangol
lourenco
took
over
as
state
president
in
september
last
year
when
dos
santos
stepped
down
after
almost
four
decades
in
power
but
the
latter
remained
head
of
the
mpla
which
has
ruled
angola
since
it
won
independence
from
portugal
in
the
mpla
s
politburo
the
organ
in
the
former
marxist

in
september
dos
santos
position
as
head
of
the
party
was
widely
regarded
as
an
attempt
to
maintain
control
of
the
state
but
lourenço
has
shown
he
is
in
charge
the
action
against
quantum
global
follows
this
pattern
as
the
new
administration
seeks
to
weed
out
the
influence
of
dos

appointees
in
a
bid
to
woo
