update 4-despite warmth, merkel and trump still differ on trade and nato
washington
reuters
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
and
president
donald
trump
aired
differences
over
trade
and
nato
on
friday
at
a
white
house
meeting
where
they
tried
to
put
on
a
show
of
warmth
and
friendship
despite
tensions
between
the
two
allies
with
trump
poised
to
impose
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
soon
that
will
impact
european
exports
merkel
said
the
decision
is
now
in
trump
s
hands
on
whether
to
grant
exemptions
to
european
union
nations
we
had
an
exchange
of
views
the
decision
lies
with
the
president
merkel
told
a
joint
press
conference
after
trump
complained
about
the
trade
imbalance
particularly
in
regards
to
automobiles
merkel
s
quick
trip
came
the
same
week
as
a
state
visit
by
french
president
emmanuel
macron
who
like
merkel
pressed
trump
on
trade
and
urged
him
to
keep
the
united
states
in
a
nuclear
deal
with
iran
neither
leader
appeared
to
make
significant
progress
convincing
trump
on
either
issue
merkel
said
she
could
see
negotiating
a
bilateral
trade
deal
between
the
eu
and
the
united
states
saying
the
world
trade
organization
has
been
unable
to
deliver
multilateral
agreements
trump
said
he
wanted
a
reciprocal
trade
relationship
with
germany
and
other
european
nations
and
wanted
germany
and
other
nato
allies
to
pay
more
for
their
common
defence
an
issue
he
has
raised
repeatedly
we
need
a
reciprocal
relationship
which
we
don
t
have
we
re
working
on
it
and
we
want
to
make
it
more
fair
and
the
chancellor
wants
to
make
it
more
fair
trump
said
after
their
last
white
house
meeting
drew
attention
when
the
two
leaders
did
not
shake
hands
in
the
oval
office
trump
made
a
point
of
doing
just
that
twice
while
congratulating
the
german
chancellor
on
her
recent
election
win
they
exchanged
kisses
on
the
cheek
when
she
first
arrived
at
the
white
house
we
have
a
really
great
relationship
and
we
actually
have
had
a
great
relationship
right
from
the
beginning
but
some
people
didn
t
understand
that
trump
said
in
the
oval
office
calling
merkel
a
very
extraordinary
merkel
acknowledged
that
it
took
a
while
to
form
a
government
after
heavy
election
losses
to
the
but
she
said
it
was
important
to
her
to
make
her
first
trip
out
of
europe
since
establishing
her
administration
to
washington
the
cautious
merkel
has
not
established
a
particularly
strong
personal
rapport
with
the
brash
trump
and
the
mood
of
her
working
visit
contrasted
sharply
with
the
tactile
bromance
between
trump
and
macron
chemistry
aside
merkel
was
careful
to
praise
trump
s
progress
on
north
korea
while
addressing
some
of
his
concerns
point
by
point
on
defence
spending
which
she
said
berlin
was
increasing
and
german
cars
many
of
which
she
noted
were
produced
in
the
united
states
on
the
iran
nuclear
deal
merkel
said
it
was
a
first
step
that
had
helped
reduce
nuclear
activities
and
better
monitor
them
but
added
we
germans
think
it
s
not
enough
to
really
ensure
iran
takes
on
a
role
founded
in
reliability
so
more
is
macron
made
the
european
position
on
the
iran
nuclear
deal
clear
ahead
of
merkel
s
visit
on
wednesday
he
called
on
the
united
states
not
to
abandon
the
iran
deal
as
western
envoys
said
britain
france
and
germany
were
nearing
agreeing
a
package
they
hope
could
persuade
trump
to
save
the
pact
trump
will
decide
by
may
whether
to
revive
sanctions
on
iran
doing
so
would
be
a
serious
blow
to
the
nuclear
deal
which
many
western
countries
sees
as
essential
for
stopping
tehran
developing
a
nuclear
bomb
