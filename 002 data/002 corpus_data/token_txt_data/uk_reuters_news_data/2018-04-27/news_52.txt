a
lawyer
and
activist
strolled
across
a
manicured
park
on
the
edge
of
the
munzur
river
that
runs
through
tunceli
a
small
city
in
eastern
turkey
on
the
other
side
of
a
fence
is
the
uzuncayir
hydropower
dam
that
was
completed
in
and
flooded
a
site
sacred
to
alevis
the
country
s
largest
religious
minority
yildirim
an
alevi
living
in
the
home
of
his
ancestors
who
revere
nature
has
been
on
a
mission
since
to
stop
the
government
from
building
more
dams
in
the
province
this
park
was
built
to
appease
us
by
the
company
who
built
that
dam
yildirim
said
bitterly
but
now
we
have
to
pray
through
a
yildirum
has
filed
lawsuits
and
won
some
cases
over
the
years
his
latest
battle
is
to
prevent
the
government
seizing
land
for
the
konaktepe
dam
which
would
be
located
inside
a
nearby
nature
reserve
winning
he
said
could
mean
saving
the
alevi
s
cultural
heritage
the
founder
of
modern
turkey
mustafa
kemal
ataturk
saw
dams
as
a
way
forward
for
the
developing
nation
and
many
of
those
now
being
built
were
planned
decades
ago
locals
who
oppose
the
dams
have
become
victims
of
the
country
s
energy
politics
said
ozer
meral
uc
an
ecologist
and
member
of
the
munzur
flows
freely
movement
a
coalition
of
civil
society
groups
in
tunceli
officials
have
publicly
said
hydroelectric
dams
are
needed
to
meet
turkey
s
energy
and
water
needs
and
reduce
its
dependency
on
countries
that
sell
energy
the
state
wants
to
reduce
its
dependence
on
energy
from
foreign
countries
uc
said
but
the
konaktepe
will
flood
people
s
moreoever
water
stored
in
dams
could
prevent
drought
for
several
years
if
needed
the
government
has
said
last
year
water
levels
were
at
their
lowest
in
nearly
half
a
century
making
up
about
percent
of
turkey
s
million
people
alevis
draw
from
shi
a
sufi
and
anatolian
folk
traditions
practicing
distinct
rituals
which
can
put
them
at
odds
with
their
sunni
muslim
counterparts
many
of
whom
accuse
them
of
heresy
the
government
is
trying
to
assimilate
us
into
sunni
islam
there
s
a
project
to
kill
our
culture
and
heritage
said
yildirim
the
government
which
has
held
a
series
of
workshops
for
alevis
to
allow
them
to
voice
their
concerns
in
an
effort
to
reconcile
tense
relations
was
unavailable
for
comment
despite
numerous
emails
and
calls
four
years
ago
yildirim
won
a
lawsuit
at
the
country
s
highest
court
halting
construction
of
the
konaktepe
dam
the
court
ruled
the
dam
was
illegal
as
it
would
cut
through
the
munzur
national
park
an
area
rich
in
biodiversity
where
types
of
flora
and
fauna
thrive
despite
the
ruling
the
government
has
continued
to
push
forward
with
the
project
by
buying
and
seizing
land
yildirim
said
the
ruling
justice
and
development
party
akp
has
ramped
up
building
dams
in
alone
local
media
said
despite
an
international
outcry
from
environmentalists
and
local
people
when
the
government
seizes
land
to
build
infrastructure
deemed
in
the
national
interest
it
is
legally
obliged
to
compensate
landowners
when
they
refuse
to
sell
cases
end
up
in
court
despite
the
court
ruling
four
years
ago
the
resmi
gazete
which
publishes
laws
and
official
announcements
said
in
the
government
would
expropriate
land
in
the
mountains
where
the
konaktepe
dam
was
going
to
be
built
once
completed
the
dam
would
produce
percent
of
the
country
s
energy
worth
million
annually
according
to
a
report
from
the
istanbul
water
tribunal
an
international
body
that
resolves
water
conflicts
some
people
have
already
sold
their
land
many
of
the
people
who
sell
their
land
don
t
understand
the
consequences
yildirim
said
back
in
celal
kara
s
father
sold
his
land
when
one
of
the
first
tunceli
dams
the
mercan
was
being
built
kara
said
he
was
duped
my
father
was
convinced
because
the
government
then
told
us
that
our
village
will
look
like
paris
but
the
trees
were
cut
down
nature
was
destroyed
and
we
lost
our
village
she
said
the
konaktepe
dam
was
one
of
a
number
of
projects
planned
in
in
a
deal
between
turkey
and
the
united
states
department
of
commerce
the
plan
originally
envisioned
the
involvement
of
exim
bank
which
underwrites
risk
for
companies
abroad
though
the
bank
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
by
email
it
was
involved
only
in
the
phase
opaqueness
around
the
project
means
it
is
unclear
which
foreign
or
local
companies
are
involved
or
even
at
what
stage
the
process
is
at
activists
said
sarah
bardeen
a
spokeswoman
for
international
rivers
a
advocacy
group
said
tunceli
locals
were
in
a
difficult
position
governments
need
to
abide
by
their
judiciary
and
turkey
s
judiciary
decisively
halted
the
konaktepe
dam
in
but
the
project
is
rearing
its
ugly
head
again
bardeen
said
if
the
government
won
t
abide
by
the
rules
locals
and
their
allies
will
have
to
target
the
financiers
and
the
construction
companies
that
are
moving
forward
with
an
illegal
project
against
the
wishes
of
the
local
yildirim
and
other
activists
in
the
munzur
flows
freely
movement
said
solar
power
would
prove
much
less
damaging
to
their
sacred
environment
and
could
meet
their
energy
needs
protests
against
projects
fizzled
out
after
the
government
fined
protesters
in
tunceli
and
elsewhere
following
the
attempted
coup
in
when
rogue
elements
in
the
military
tried
to
overthrow
president
recep

been
