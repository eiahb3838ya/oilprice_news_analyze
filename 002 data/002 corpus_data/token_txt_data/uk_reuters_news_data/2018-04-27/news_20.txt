caracas
reuters
a
grace
period
on
chinese
loans
to
venezuela
has
lapsed
according
to
two
venezuelan
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
potentially
depriving
the
opec
nation
of
billions
of
dollars
in
desperately
needed
oil
revenue
this
year
china
eased
the
payment
terms
two
years
ago
on
some
billion
billion
pounds
in
deals
under
which
venezuela
sends
shipments
of
crude
oil
and
fuel
to
pay
off
debt
allowing
venezuela
to
make
payments
the
favorable
conditions
from
beijing
helped
president
nicolas
maduro
s
socialist
government
weather
a
collapse
in
venezuela
s
economy
which
slid
into
hyperinflation
and
a
painful
recession
following
a
downturn
in
oil
prices
but
the
grace
period
has
lapsed
without
a
renewal
in
recent
weeks
according
to
the
sources
who
have
been
briefed
by
chinese
and
venezuelan
officials
that
could
deprive
venezuela
of
some
billion
in
annual
revenue
according
to
a
reuters
estimate
based
on
current
oil
prices
a
crippling
blow
to
a
country
already
struggling
to
import
basic
goods
like
food
and
medicine
the
sources
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
said
that
venezuela
continues
to
press
for
an
extension
but
is
responsible
for
making
the
full
payments
while
the
talks
continue
the
sharply
increased
payments
would
absorb
roughly
an
additional
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
venezuela
s
oil
production
which
has
fallen
to
a
low
this
year
state
oil
company
petroleos
de
venezuela
sa
s
pdvsa
deteriorating
infrastructure
and
cash
flow
have
caused
oil
production
to
plunge
percent
in
a
year
to
million
bpd
in
march
according
to
official
data
reported
to
opec
china
maintains
its
position
of
not
increasing
its
exposure
to
venezuela
and
is
adjusting
conditions
given
that
the
price
of
oil
is
now
per
barrel
above
its
level
when
the
grace
period
was
created
said
one
of
the
sources
neither
venezuela
s
information
ministry
nor
state
oil
company
pdvsa
responded
to
requests
for
comment
china
development
bank
which
has
underwritten
most
of
the
loans
to
venezuela
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
china
s
foreign
ministry
asked
about
the
negotiations
said
that
cooperation
was
proceeding
smoothly
and
the
loan
contracts
were
in
accord
with
international
standards
caracas
could
seek
to
preserve
cash
flow
by
sending
those
barrels
to
other
clients
who
pay
cash
defaulting
on
its
obligations
to
china
in
the
process
and
straining
ties
with
a
crucial
political
ally
and
its
largest
financier
beijing
would
have
little
incentive
to
pursue
an
embarrassing
commercial
dispute
with
a
government
it
supported
for
years
and
may
simply
turn
a
blind
eye
to
a
default
maduro
who
is
up
for
on
may
says
his
country
is
victim
of
an
economic
war
led
by
his
political
adversaries
with
the
help
of
washington
his
critics
say
the
country
s
plight
is
the
result
of
a
dysfunctional
economic
model
china
for
a
decade
courted
the
government
of
hugo
chavez
with
generous
financing
arrangements
as
it
sought
to
secure
oil
supplies
for
its
economy
and
cultivate
an
ally
in
latin
america
it
extended
more
than
billion
in
credit
to
venezuela
over
years
however
beijing
stopped
renewing
loans
three
years
ago
as
venezuela
s
economy
began
spiraling
downward
as
a
result
of
the
crash
of
oil
prices
last
year
venezuela
shipped
some
bpd
of
crude
and
fuel
to
china
through
bilateral
agreements
according
to
a
reuters
review
of
pdvsa
trade
documents
but
only
around
bpd
were
applied
to
debt
service
under
the
grace
period
arrangement
according
to
one
of
the
sources
with
china
paying
the
remainder
in
cash
without
the
grace
period
the
amount
applied
to
debt
service
rises
to
bpd
the
sources
said
venezuela
and
pdvsa
are
in
default
on
nearly
billion
in
international
bonds
because
they
have
failed
to
make
more
than
billion
in
interest
payments
bondholders
have
yet
to
take
legal
action
in
part
because
most
believe
maduro
is
unwilling
to
make
changes
to
revive
the
economy
and
because
sanctions
effectively
block
them
from
buying
any
newly
issued
venezuelan
bonds
making
a
restructuring
practically
impossible
pdvsa
also
has
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
outstanding
bills
to
suppliers
and
partners
italian
energy
company
eni
said
on
friday
that
pdvsa
s
debt
had
risen
to
million
euros
million
from
million
euros
in
february
and
that
payments
were
near
euros
