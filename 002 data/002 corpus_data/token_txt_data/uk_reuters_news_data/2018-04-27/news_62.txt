has
ordered
a
host
of
cities
to
crack

on
heavy
industry
as
part
of
its
war
on
smog
which
has
become
a
social
issue
amid
concerns
about
damage
to
people
s
health
a
sales
manager
at
liguo
zhenbei
steel
co
which
operates
one
of
the
closed
mills
said
local
authorities
had
ordered
all
steel
plants
in
the
city
to
shut
until
they
meet
the
latest
tough
requirements
aimed
at
cleaning
its
notoriously
toxic

dongnan
steel
industrial
co
ltd
one
of
the
city
s
biggest
steel
mills
by
production
capacity
is
temporarily
closed
for
maintenance
an
official
told
reuters
by
phone
the
official
did
not
say
how
long
the
plant
would
be
shut
earlier
this
month
the
city
launched
six
months
of
environmental
inspections
at
industrial
plants
and
construction
sites
as
part
of
its
action
plan
to
clean
its
skies
at
the
beginning
i
thought
my
mill
would
be
exempt
from
the
closure
list
since
our
mill
emits
less
harmful
substances
said
a
deputy
general
manager
at
an
furnace
eaf
in
the
city
he
said
his
family
name
was
wang
but
declined
to
give
his
first
name
he
did
not
want
the
company
he
works
for
to
be
identified
eafs
or
use
scrap
steel
and
emit
far
less
carbon
than
blast
furnaces
which
have
to
go
through
the
polluting
sintering
process
to
make
hot
metal
however
wang
s
mill
last
week
was
also
ordered
to
close
until
it
can
pass
a
test
conducted
by
a
environmental
detection
agency
that
is
unlikely
to
happen
before
the
end
of
may
he
said
xuzhou
is
a
hub
of
million
tonnes
of
steelmaking
capacity
in
the
eastern
province
of
jiangsu
china
s
steel
producing
province
after
hebei
the
city
is
under
particular
pressure
to
deal
with
the
problem
because
its
average
concentration
of
hazardous
breathable
particles
known
as
rose
by
percent
in
missing
the
national
target
for
a
cut
average
levels
for
april
so
far
have
been
micrograms
per
cubic
meter
up
from
the
same
time
last
year
and
almost
double
the

aim
to
drop
to
below
micrograms
