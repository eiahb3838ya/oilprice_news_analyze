update 1-germany approves offshore wind parks able to generate 1,610 mw
frankfurt
reuters
germany
has
granted
approval
for
offshore
wind
parks
capable
of
generating
megawatts
mw
of
power
at
contract
prices
above
the
unexpectedly
low
bids
in
an
auction
a
year
ago
the
total
amount
of
electricity
that
could
be
produced
by
the
parks
approved
on
friday
equates
to
the
power
generated
by
one
large
nuclear
power
station
or
two
big
or
power
plants
offshore
wind
costs
have
fallen
sharply
around
the
north
sea
as
the
industry
develops
with
turbines
of
to
mw
size
due
to
be
delivered
in
the
next
decade
able
to
offer
twice
today
s
performance
proximity
to
existing
construction
and
maintenance
hubs
and
to
onshore
connections
is
also
allowing
more
economies
of
scale
in
the
industry
s
infancy
operators
secured
support
payments
for
years
as
there
was
little
experience
of
installing
turbines
far
out
at
sea
six
projects
were
granted
licenses
for
construction
at
an
average
euro
cents
per
kilowatt
hour
kwh
compared
with
an
average
euro
cents
in
the
first
auction
a
year
ago
the
bundesnetzagentur
network
agency
said
this
auction
wraps
up
two
rounds
for
a
total
mw
of
projects
applied
for
before
after
which
new
projects
became
subject
to
reforms
to
the
offshore
subsidy
scheme
while
the
industry
has
cut
costs
sharply
in
recent
years
last
year
s
results
were
widely
viewed
as
overly
optimistic
bundesnetzagentur
president
jochen
homann
said
on
friday
this
year
s
result
reflected
a
changed
competitive
situation
but
noted
the
range
of
bids
made
by
operators
again
included
some
not
seeking
a
subsidy
without
giving
details
the
range
was
between
zero
and
cents
for
the
six
projects
three
of
which
are
in
the
baltic
sea
and
three
in
the
north
sea
germany
s
innogy
said
it
had
been
awarded
the
rights
to
build
and
operate
the
mw
kaskasi
wind
farm
in
the
north
sea
denmark
s
orsted
formerly
dong
said
it
won
approval
for
two
bids
of
a
joint
mw
in
the
north
sea
the
other
winning
companies
were
iberdrola
s
german
branch
knk
wind
and
baltic
eagle
the
operators
rely
on
expected
wholesale
power
price
revenue
for
the
time
that
the
offshore
wind
capacity
starts
operating
plus
the
auction
price
awarded
to
achieve
profitability
the
winners
get
an
option
to
build
the
wind
parks
between
and
at
the
price
they
were
awarded
or
pay
penalties
they
also
gain
the
right
to
onshore
connections
and
operation
rights
for
years
german
thermal
operators
currently
obtain
cents
a
kwh
in
the
wholesale
market
for
power
delivery
next
year
while
of
electricity
pay
around
due
to
a
high
share
of
taxes
and
fees
last
year
orsted
and
enbw
won
a
total
mw
of
capacity
permits
for
pledging
to
build
mw
of
the
total
at
zero
subsidy
the
next

round
will
be
held
in
