analysis-higher oil prices could be a game changer for asia's trade-gap trio
kong
reuters
asia
s
most
externally
vulnerable
economies
india
indonesia
and
the
philippines
have
just
taken
a
punch
treasury
bond
yields
hit
percent
this
week
a
level
long
touted
as
one
to
watch
for
potential
portfolio
outflows
from
the
region
where
interest
rates
have
barely
shifted
since
the
federal
reserve
began
slowing
hiking
policy
rates
in
late
an
even
bigger
worry
is
that
oil
prices
hit
year
highs
not
only
do
these
countries
run
the
biggest
current
account
deficits
of
asia
s
major
economies
but
they
are
also
among
region
s
most
voracious
oil
importers
if
oil
prices
stay
at
their
current
levels
of
around
a
barrel
projections
for
inflation
growth
budget
and
trade
deficits
could
be
missed
increasing
selling
pressure
on
the
trio
s
currencies
stocks
and
bonds
already
among
asia
s
worst
performers
and
potentially
forcing
their
central
banks
to
raise
interest
rates
sooner
than
they
otherwise
would
higher
rates
could
in
turn
hurt
growth
and
budgets
creating
a
loop
that
further
erodes
confidence
in
local
assets
if
higher
oil
prices
are
sustained
interest
rates
will
be
raised
faster
than
anticipated
said
tilak
doshi
analyst
at
energy
consultancy
muse
stancil
co
in
its
projections
for
growth
and
inflation
indonesia
s
central
bank
said
it
works
on
an
assumption
of
oil
at
a
barrel
the
philippines
said
it
works
with
while
india
according
to
two
finance
ministry
sources
works
with
these
averages
might
still
be
attained
if
oil
prices
drop
back
but
the
recent
has
prompted
many
analysts
to
call
an
end
to
the
oil
market
slump
that
started
in
and
prompted
hints
that
policymakers
assumptions
are
changing
in
february
the
philippines
central
bank
raised
its
inflation
projection
to
percent
from
percent
previously
mainly
due
to
higher
oil
prices
but
expects
this
to
be
a
temporary
breach
of
its
percent
target
at
the
start
of
the
year
it
was
expected
to
raise
interest
rates
once
or
twice
in
now
some
analysts
see
three
hikes
india
and
indonesia
were
the
last
major
central
banks
in
asia
to
cut
rates
last
year
and
were
mostly
expected
to
stay
put
throughout
but
analysts
say
hikes
are
now
on
the
table
indonesia
said
on
tuesday
it
had
been
selling
foreign
currency
in
quite
a
sizeable
amount
to
halt
the
rupiah
s
depreciation
since
last
week
at
an
imf
meeting

washington
on
sunday

of
india
rbi
governor
urjit
patel
flagged
oil
prices
as
a
growing
risk
for
inflation
philippines
three
interest
rate
hikes
are
expected
in
the
next
three
meetings
if
oil
prices
stay
at
these
levels
then
rbi
may
have
to
raise
rates
indonesia
is
the
next
country
to
watch
said
robert
subbaraman
chief
economist
for
asia
at
nomura
the
philippines
current
account
deficit
doubled
to
percent
of
gdp
last
year
indonesia
s
current
account
deficit
is
seen
doubling
in
the
first
quarter
to
percent
of
gdp
the
same
level
that
india
s
was
in
and
things
are
getting
worse
indonesia
s
crude
oil
imports
bill
rose
by
billion
or
percent
on
the
year
in
the
philippines
significantly
scaled
back
oil
imports
in
the
first
quarter
but
still
spent
million
more
than
the
total
india
s
oil
imports
cost
rose
by
billion
or
percent
in
the
same
period
trade
balances
for
india
philippines
indonesia
deteriorate
amid
rising
import
costs
local
assets
are
feeling
the
pressure
the
philippine
peso
indonesian
rupiah
and
indian
rupee
have
lost
around
percent
from
their
early
january
highs
indian
stocks
fell
around
percent
indonesia
percent
and
philippines
percent
bond
yields
are
up
basis
points
bps
in
india
and
more
than
bps
in
indonesia
and
the
philippines
over
the
same
period
by
contrast
in
south
korea
also
a
major
oil
importer
but
one
that
runs
a
trade
surplus
the
won
is
steady
stocks
are
up
and
bond
yields
are
marginally
higher
analysts
see
the
selling
pressure
intensifying
this
week
maybank
revised
its
rupee
forecast
to
per
dollar
around
current
levels
from
previously
and
anz
revised
it
to
from
we
think
the
surge
in
oil
price
is
a
key
game
changer
for
the
rupee
as
the
rise
in
oil
prices
present
a
double
whammy
on
india
one
in
terms
of
current
account
deterioration
and
two
in
terms
of
upside
risks
to
inflation
maybank
analysts
said
to
be
sure
all
three
countries
are
considered
to
have
adequate
foreign
exchange
reserves
and
the
current
account
positions
of
india
and
indonesia
are
better
than
during
the
previous
lengthy
period
of
outflows
from
asia
in
prompted
by
the
fed
s
first
signals
that
its
unconventional
easing
measures
were
about
to
be
rolled
back
current
account
and
fx
reserves
in
india
indonesia
philippines
higher
oil
prices
could
make
those
economies
more
vulnerable
but
are
unlikely
to
cause
panic
nomura
estimates
each
per
barrel
increase
in
oil
prices
could
widen
the
trade
deficit
in
the
philippines
by
percent
of
gdp
and
raise
inflation
by
bps
in
indonesia
it
could
lower
the
trade
balance
by
percent
of
gdp
and
add
bps
to
inflation
in
india
it
could
worsen
the
current
account
balance
by
percent
of
gdp
and
increase
inflation
by
bps
in
a
note
in
february
anz
said
an
average
oil
price
of
a
barrel
could
add
bps
to
inflation
in
each
country
fuel
prices
are
especially
politically
sensitive
in
asia
s
poorer
countries
and
a
further
risk
is
that
higher
costs
could
push
governments
to
raise
subsidies
or
introduce
tighter
regulation
on
prices
which
could
contain
inflation
but
hurt
central
budgets
and
energy
firms
indonesian
president
joko
widodo
and
indian
prime
minister
narendra
modi
are
facing
elections
in
the
coming
year
having
enjoyed
oil
prices
at
historically
low
levels
throughout
their
terms
in
indonesia
state
oil
firm
pertamina
is
shouldering
the
burden
of
subsidies
as
the
government
has
pledged
to
keep
prices
unchanged
for
two
years
india
has
not
taken
any
such
measures
i
would
classify
subsidies
as
a
policy
mistake
because
it
means
reallocating
fiscal
resources
in
an
inefficient
way
