china
s
vast
steel
sector
is
currently
a
study
in
contrasts
with
record
output
despite
ongoing
production
curbs
and
high
prices
even
though
there
is
mounting
concern
about
the
demand
outlook
it
s
becoming
increasingly
difficult
to
reconcile
the
seemingly
contradictory
signals
being
sent
by
china
s
steel
industry
which
accounts
for
about
half
of
the
world
s
total
production
china
produced
million
tonnes
of
crude
steel
in
june
slightly
below
may
s
record
million
tonnes
according
to
official
data
released
last
week
however
june
s
daily
output
was
a
record
million
tonnes
the
third
month
in
a
row
that
daily
production
has
scaled
new
highs
the
sharp
increase
this
year
in
steel
output
has
come
despite
increasing
moves
to
restrict
production
in
order
to
curb
pollution
the
top
city
of
tangshen
ordered
steel
mills
to
shut
sintering
plants
for
five
days
from
july
to
the
latest
in
a
line
of
measures
aimed
at
reducing
air
pollution
what
is
clear
is
that
production
curbs
are
having
no
overall
impact
on
steel
output
steel
mills
outside
the
northeast
region
where
the
bulk
of
the
curbs
have
been
enacted
have
been
able
to
ramp
up
production
resulting
in
a
geographical
shift
of
output
producers
have
also
been
maximising
the
efficiency
of
their
blast
furnaces
by
using
higher
grades
of
iron
ore
allowing
them
to
make
more
steel
without
a
corresponding
increase
in
emissions
the
question
becomes
how
much
longer
can
this
situation
persist
can
steel
output
keep
rising
in
the
face
of
ongoing
pollution
control
measures
which
are
in
place
in
three
major
steel
producing
regions
despite
the
closure
of
older
and
less
efficient
furnaces
and
the
likelihood
this
will
continue
in
the
coming
years
china
still
has
ample
spare
capacity
and
is
able
to
make
more
than
billion
tonnes
of
steel
annually
production
in
the
first
six
months
of
this
year
was
million
tonnes
putting
china
on
target
to
produce
a
record
of
more
than
million
tonnes
in
steel
mills
are
being
encouraged
to
produce
as
much
as
possible
by
strong
margins
and
the
expectation
that
stricter
curbs
will
be
imposed
this
winter
than
those
that
were
enforced
during
the
past
winter
steel
rebar
futures
in
shanghai
rose
above
yuan
a
tonne
during
tuesday
s
trading
the
first
time
they
reached
this
level
since
september
last
year
at
this
price
most
chinese
steel
mills
will
be
making
profits
in
the
region
of
yuan
to
yuan
a
tonne
which
would
be
the
strongest
margins
the
industry
has
enjoyed
in
several
years
with
output
robust
the
question
becomes
what
is
happening
to
all
the
steel
being
produced
it
s
not
being
added
to
visible
inventories
with
stocks
tracked
by
consultancy
shanghai
steelhome
falling
consistently
since
march
dropping
to
million
tonnes
in
the
week
to
july
this
is
down
from
the
recent
peak
of
million
tonnes
in
the
week
to
march
and
inventories
are
currently
at
their
lowest
since
late
january
the
steel
isn
t
being
exported
either
with
shipments
of
products
in
the
first
six
months
dropping
percent
from
the
same
period
in
to
million
tonnes
according
to
customs
data
domestic
demand
has
been
driven
by
construction
and
manufacturing
growth
but
overall
economic
growth
of
percent
as
reported
for
the
second
quarter
isn
t
so
strong
as
to
justify
the
sharp
increase
in
steel
output
in
recent
months
it
s
likely
that
at
some
point
in
the
second
half
steel
output
will
decline
either
as
the
market
becomes
oversupplied
or
as
pollution
restrictions
mount
or
even
a
combination
of
both
the
rising
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
china
may
also
crimp
steel
demand
to
some
extent
but
this
is
still
an
unquantifiable
risk
