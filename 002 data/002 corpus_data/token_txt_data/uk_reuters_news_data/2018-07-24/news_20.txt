turkey
has
told
american
officials
it
opposes
sanctions
on
iran
and
is
not
obliged
to
implement
them
foreign
minister
mevlut
cavusoglu
said
on
tuesday
president
donald
trump
has
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
a
nuclear
pact
with
iran
and
ordered
sanctions
on
tehran
while
a
senior
state
department
official
said
washington
has
told
allies
to
cut
imports
of
iranian
oil
by
november
turkey
has
criticised
trump
s
move
to
withdraw
from
the
nuclear
pact
and
has
publicly
resisted
the
call
to
cut
oil
imports
from
iran
we
do
not
have
to
adhere
to
the
sanctions
imposed
on
a
country
by
another
country
we
don
t
find
the
sanctions
right
either
cavusoglu
told
a
news
conference
in
azerbaijan
we
held
meetings
with
the
united
states
in
ankara
and
told
them
openly
turkey
gets
oil
and
gas
from
azerbaijan
iran
russia
and
iraq
if
i
don
t
buy
from
iran
now
where
am
i
supposed
to
meet
that
need
from
cavusoglu
said
last
week
treasury
and
state
department
officials
met
turkish
counterparts
in
ankara
to
discuss
sanctions
on
iran
ankara
said
authorities
were
working
to
prevent
turkey
being
hurt
by
the
measures
turkey
depends
on
imports
for
almost
all
of
its
energy
needs
in
the
first
four
months
of
this
year
turkey
bought
more
than
million
tonnes
of
crude
oil
from
iran
almost
percent
of
its
total
crude
supplies
according
to
data
from
the
turkish
energy
watchdog
epdk
ties
between
ankara
and
washington
nato
allies
have
been
strained
over
a
host
of
issues
including
several
legal
cases
a
turkish
court
last
week
ruled
to
keep
american
pastor
andrew
brunson
in
jail
in
a
case
that
has
deepened
existing
rifts
and
jeopardised
the
procurement
of
lockheed
martin
jets
by
turkey
the
senate
passed
a
bill
last
month
including
a
measure
that
prohibits
turkey
from
buying
the
jets
because
of
brunson
s
imprisonment
and
turkey
s
purchase
of
russia
s
air
defence
system
which
are
incompatible
with
nato
systems
cavusoglu
however
said
there
were
no
issues
with
the
procurement
of
the
jets
and
the
united
states
could
not
exclude
turkey
from
the
project
the
united
states
needs
to
understand
that
it
is
not
possible
to
get
a
result
from
turkey
through
sanctions
they
will
see
results
if
they
approach
turkey
with
dialogue
and
respect
he
said
we
will
not
bow
down
to
such
pressures
sanctions
or
threats
everyone
will
get
used
to
