update 2-in first for uk, govt clears cuadrilla to frack shale gas site
london

shale
gas
developer
cuadrilla
on
tuesday
became
the
first
operator
in
britain
to
receive
final
consent
from
the
government
to
frack
an
onshore
horizontal
exploration
well
paving
the
way
for
commercial
production
the
government
said
it
had
granted
approval
for
hydraulic
fracturing
to
take
place
at
cuadrilla
s
preston
new
road
site
in
northwest
england
i
have
carefully
considered
cuadrilla
s
application
and
i
am
content
that
hydraulic
fracturing
consent
should
be
granted
in
this
instance
energy

clean

minister
claire
perry
said
in
a
statement
hydraulic
fracturing
consent
was
introduced
in
as
an
additional
step
to
the
government
s
regulatory
and
permitting
regime
and
ensures
all
necessary
environmental
health
and
safety
permits
have
been
obtained
fracking
involves
perforating
wells
and
fracturing
rocks
by
injecting
liquids
sands
and
chemicals
to
suck
in
oil
and
gas
cuadrilla
welcomed
the
government
s
decision
we
now
look
forward
to
submitting
a
fracture
consent
application
to
the
government
for
our
second
exploration
well
and
moving
on
to
fracture
the
shale
rock
and
flow
the
natural
gas
which
we
believe
will
make
a
major
contribution
to
reducing
the
uk
s
gas
imports
and
improving
our
environment
and
economy
cuadrilla
chief
executive
francis
egan
said
in
a
statement
following
fracking
of
the
first
two
horizontal
wells
cuadrilla
will
run
an
initial
flow
test
of
the
gas
produced
from
both
for
about
six
months
the
firm
added
weaning
britain
off
energy
imports
is
one
of
the
driving
forces
behind
government
support
for
fracking
in
may
the
government
announced
plans
to
speed
up
planning
applications
to
support
development
of
the
country
s
shale
gas
industry
some
of
the
proposed
measures
include
approving
planning
applications
at
a
national
rather
than
local
level
the
british
geological
survey
estimates
shale
gas
resources
in
northern
england
alone
could
contain
trillion
cubic
feet
of
gas
percent
of
which
could
meet
the
country
s
demand
for
almost
years
however
it
is
impossible
to
know
exactly
how
much
shale
gas
might
be
underground
and
more
importantly
how
much
can
be
extracted
until
fracking
has
started
in
earnest
environmental
groups
continue
to
be
strongly
opposed
to
fracking
concerned
about
the
potential
seismic
activity
water
contamination
and
other
unknowables
the
scottish
government
has
in
effect
banned
fracking
by
ordering
local
authorities
to
reject
planning
applications
from
companies
seeking
to
do
shale
gas
exploration
after
a
public
consultation
found
overwhelming
opposition
to
it
several
other
european
countries
have
banned
it
other
companies
are
vying
to
start
fracking
onshore
in
britain
third
energy
percent
owned
by
barclays
is
waiting
for
approval
from
the
government
to
begin
test
fracking
at
its
kirby
misperton
site
in
yorkshire
northern
england
