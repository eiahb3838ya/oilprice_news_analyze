portfolio
managers
tend
to
hold
a
majority
of
their
positions
in
contracts
close
to
expiry
because
that
s
where
the
liquidity
is
normally
greatest
just
as
by
the
hedge

spurred
the
rise
in
spot
prices
and

in
the
second

of
and

now
accelerating
the
correction
more
fundamentally
traders
have
reacted
to
pledges
of
increased
output
and
exports
from
saudi

kuwait
the
united
arab
emirates
and
russia
saudi
arabia
and
its
opec
and
allies
have
responded
to
pressure
from
the
united
states
to
counter
rising
prices
by
increasing
their
production
extra
barrels
have
been
loaded
in
june
and

with
more
promised
in

ensuring
increased
availability
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
fears
about
slower
consumption
growth
as
a
result
of
a
strengthening
dollar
and
the
intensifying
trade
conflict
between
the
united
states
and
china
are
also
weighing
on
oil
prices
because
the
oil
market
is
concerns
about
the
strength
of
consumption
growth
later
in
and
are
being
discounted
back
to
lower
oil
prices
in
the
spot
prices
and
calendar
spreads
both
exhibit
cyclical
behaviour
at
all
scales
from
very
seconds
minutes
and
days
to
longer
time
horizons
months
quarters
and
years
in
addition
to
the
principal
cycle
in
the
oil
industry
the
time
series
shows
smaller
epicycles
operating
at
every
scale
the
recent
softening
of
both
spot
prices
and
calendar
spreads
marks
the
turning
of
an
epicycle
underway
since
the
brent
calendar
spread
surged
from
contango
on
june
to
backwardation
on
april
before
easing
down
to
cents
contango
on
july
over
the
same
period

net
long
positions
in
brent
soared
from
million
barrels
at
the
end
of
june
to
peak
at
million
barrels
in
april
and
have
now
been
reduced
to
million
the
recent
softening
in
spot
prices
and
spreads
arguably
marks
the
ending
of
another
epicycle
that
dates
even
further
back
to
the
start
of
the
cyclical
upswing
in
during
the
recoveries
after
the
last
two
oil
market
slumps
dating
from
and
spot
prices
rose
for
and
months
respectively
before
reaching
their
first
major
peak
and
spreads
rose
for
and
months
in
the
current
expansion
spot
prices
have
risen
for
around
months
reaching
their
first
major
peak
in
may
while
spreads
have
widened
for
around
months
peaking
in
april
the
current
expansion
is
already
relatively
mature
by
most
measures
and
has
reabsorbed
most
if
not
all
the
slack
inherited
from
the
slump
rising
prices
have
started
to
force
a
series
of
adjustments
including
a
rapid
increase
in
output
from
shale
firms
and
opec
the
higher
prices
will
likely
cause
a
slowdown
in
consumption
growth
though
this
may
not
be
evident
for
some
months
given
the
longer
delays
in
the
collection
and
publication
of
data
fuel
prices
in
many
emerging
markets
are
hitting
record
levels
passing
previous
peaks
in
and
as
a
result
of
a
stronger
dollar
and
the
reduction
of
subsidies
experience
suggests
the
ending
of
an
epicycle
need
not
mark
the
overall
peak
of
the
oil
market
cycle
but
whether
the
current
softening
in
spot
prices
and
spreads
turns
out
to
be
a
temporary
pause
before
the
market
starts
tightening
again
or
a
cyclical
peak
depends
critically
on
what
happens
with
the
global
economy
there
is
now
almost
no
cyclical
slack
in
the
oil
market
with
stocks
and
spare
capacity
low
if
consumption
growth
remains
brisk
it
will
eventually
drive
spot
prices
and
spreads
higher
again
to
enforce
rebalancing
but
macroeconomic
distortions
and
imbalances
are
starting
to
accumulate
around
the
world
in
a
reprise
of
the
end
of
previous
cycles
business
cycle
expansions
in
the
united
states
and
around
the
rest
of
the
world
are
relatively
mature
economies
are
running
out
of
cyclical
slack
and
inflationary
pressures
are
rising
interest
rates
are
rising
and
the
dollar
is
appreciating
against
almost
all
other
major
currencies
the
united
states
is
still
experiencing
a
strong
cyclical
expansion
but
the
combination
of
tax
cuts
and
rising
interest
rates
is
causing
significant
currency
appreciation
threatening
to
worsen
the
trade
deficit
most
other
advanced
economies
have
shown
signs
of
slowing
growth
during
the
first
half
of
and
international
trade
volumes
have
started
to
grow
more
slowly
emerging
markets
are
threatened
once
again
by
a
combination
of
rising
interest
rates
a
strengthening
dollar
and
escalating
oil
prices
a
cocktail
that
has
proved
dangerous
in
the
past
none
of
these
distortions
is
easy
to
resolve
in
the
past
they
have
often
preceded
a
macroeconomic
slowdown
with
a
resulting
slowdown
in
oil
consumption
growth
if
the
united
states
tries
to
deal
with
its
growing
trade
deficit
by
successfully
pushing
to
weaken
the
dollar
it
is
likely
to
send
nominal
oil
prices
surging
and
reawaken
concerns
about
inflation
if
on
the
other
hand
the
dollar
appreciates
further
the
resulting
increase
in
local
fuel
costs
will
hit
consumers
in
the
other
advanced
economies
and
emerging
markets
hard
putting
downward
pressure
on
crude
prices
