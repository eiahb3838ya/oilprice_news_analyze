african
and
south
asian
nations
could
miss
national
targets
to
curb
greenhouse
gas
emissions
unless
rich
countries
stop
using
them
as
dumping
grounds
for
millions
of
polluting
old
cars
a
study
has
warned
the
report
by
the
centre
for
science
and
environment
cse
said
the
united
states
japan
and
european
union
countries
had
for
years
been
exporting
old
used
cars
or
clunkers
to
nations
such
as
nigeria
and
bangladesh
the
vehicles
which
should
have
been
scrapped
under
domestic
regulations
are
instead
being
used
by
poorer
nations
where
they
are
contributing
to
carbon
emissions
said
cse
a
new
weak
environmental
regulations
in
poorer
economies
and
stronger
emissions
regulations
in
exporting
countries
are
among
the
factors
inciting
this
unregulated
global
trade
in
clunkers
said
anumita
roychowdhury
of
cse
on
monday
if
this
continues
unchecked
without
the
exporting
countries
sharing
the
responsibility
of
addressing
this
problem
the
poorer
countries
will
not
be
able
to
meet
their
clean
air
and
climate
mitigation
goals
she
said
during
a
press
conference
on
facebook
live
there
are
around
two
billion
vehicles
globally
of
which
percent
or
million
are
deemed
unworthy
for
road
use
in
developed
nations
annually
according
to
the
report
many
of
them
end
up
in
countries
such
as
kenya
nigeria
and
ethiopia
ninety
percent
of
nigeria
s
million
cars
are
imported
vehicles
according
to
data
from
the
management
consultancy
firm
deloitte
these
old
and
often
malfunctioning
vehicles
become
energy
guzzlers
and
emit
high
levels
of
gases
said
the
cse
even
though
the
level
of
emissions
in
less
developed
nations
is
lower
than
the
world
average
clunkers
are
a
rapidly
rising
source
of
pollution
added
the
report
if
left
uncontrolled
clunkers
could
jeopardise
climate
goals
set
by
poorer
nations
on
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
as
part
of
an
international
pact
to
slow
down
global
warming
the
cars
are
also
contributing
to
high
levels
of
air
pollution
in
cities
like
dhaka
and
lagos
increasing
the
risk
of
lung
diseases
respiratory
illnesses
and
cancer
it
added
car
manufacturers
should
be
responsible
for
taking
back
the
vehicles
recycling
or
disposing
of
them
while
authorities
in
countries
should
put
in
place
export
regulations
strong
exit
rules
are
needed
to
verify
inspect
certify
and
codify
vehicles
before
export
and
all
vehicles
with
compromised
emissions
and
safety
features
need
to
be
barred
from
export
the
study
said
many
nations
are
taking
steps
to
control
the
sector
from
reducing
their
dependency
on
used
car
imports
by
promoting
their
own
automobile
manufacturing
sector
to
raising
import
duties
on
big
vehicles
but
experts
from
the
united
nations
environment
programme
unep
said
many
countries
still
lacked
a
comprehensive
set
of
policies
to
keep
a
check
on
imported
clunkers
our
observation
is
that
countries
that
lack
policies
and
incentives
to
attract
cleaner
vehicles
are
importing
inefficient
vehicles
that
emit
greenhouse
gases
above
the
global
averages
