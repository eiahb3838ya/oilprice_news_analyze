gasoline
prices
in
north
korea
have
nearly
halved
since
late
march
market
data
analysed
by
reuters
shows
adding
weight
to
suspicions
that
fuel
is
finding
its
way
into
the
isolated
economy
from
china
and
elsewhere
despite
sanctions
the
security
council
passed
a
resolution
in
december
to
ban
nearly
percent
of
refined
petroleum
exports
to
north
korea
over
its
nuclear
and
missile
programmes
but
as
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
has
moved
to
improve
relations
with
the
united
states
china
and
south
korea
concerns
have
grown
that
the
policy
of
maximum
pressure
through
sanctions
and
isolation
is
losing
steam
gasoline
was
sold
by
private
dealers
in
the
capital
pyongyang
at
about
per
kg
as
of
tuesday
down
percent
from
per
kg
on
june
and
percent
from
this
year
s
peak
of
per
kg
on
march
according
to
reuters
analysis
of
data
compiled
by
the
daily
nk
website
diesel
prices
are
at
per
kg
down
about
percent
from
march
the
website
is
run
by
north
korean
defectors
who
collect
prices
via
phone
calls
with
traders
in
the
north
my
assessment
is
that
there
was
a
greater
inflow
of
fuel
supplies
from
abroad
especially
china
since
kim
s
trips
there
said
kang
who
works
at
daily
nk
and
speaks
regularly
to
sources
inside
north
korea
kim
first
visited
china
to
meet
president
xi
jinping
in
march
and
they
held
two
more
summits
in
may
and
june
last
week
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
accused
north
korea
of
illegally
smuggling
petroleum
products
into
the
country
at
a
level
that
far
exceeds
quotas
established
by
the
united
nations
illegal
transfers
are
the
most
prominent
means
by
which
this
is
happening
every
un
member
state
must
step
up
enforcement
he
wrote
on
twitter
without
naming
any
country
north
korea
gets
most
of
its
fuel
from
china
its
biggest
trading
partner
and
some
from
russia
washington
and
seoul
officials
have
said
the
north
imports
some
million
barrels
of
refined
petroleum
products
and
two
million
barrels
of
crude
oil
each
year
last
year
s
resolution
capped
refined
imports
at
barrels
a
year
chinese
foreign
ministry
spokesman
geng
shuang
told
reporters
on
tuesday
china
has
consistently
and
strictly
abided
by
security
council
resolutions
on
north
korea
china
had
only
exported
tonnes
of
refined
oil
products
to
north
korea
in
the
first
six
months
of
this
year
out
of
a
total
of
tonnes
a
year
stipulated
by
the
sanctions
china
had
reported
its
exports
to
the
security
council
s
sanctions
committee
in
a
timely
manner
geng
added
the
relevant
situation
is
totally
open
and
transparent
he
said
without
elaborating
overall
china
s
trade
with
north
korea
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
tumbled
percent
on
the
back
of
the
tightening
sanctions
customs
data
showed
on
monday
north
korean
rice
prices
have
also
been
stable
since
a
spike
last
september
when
the
security
council
imposed
new
sanctions
rice
has
hovered
around
per
kg
throughout
this
year
stable
fuel
and
rice
prices
suggest
no
immediate
signs
of
major
suffering
in
north
korea
despite
south
korea
s
recent
estimates
the
impoverished
state
s
economy
contracted
at
its
sharpest
rate
in
two
decades
last
year
south
korea
s
central
bank
said
north
korea
s
gross
domestic
product
shrank
percent
last
year
marking
the
biggest
decline
since
citing
international
sanctions
and
drought
while
other
defectors
reported
some
suffering
in
remote
rural
regions
kang
said
fuel
demand
has
been
steady
in
north
korea
and
overall
living
conditions
have
improved
in
line
with
a
booming
unofficial
market
economy
the
unofficial
markets
known
as
jangmadang
have
grown
to
account
for
about
percent
of
the
economy
according
to
the
institute
for
korean
integration
of
society
i
ve
seen
signs
the
economy
was
slowly
improving
over
the
past
five
years
and
in
last
year
things
are
still
developing
but
perhaps
not
as
fast
as
before
a
western
consultant
who
makes
regular
trips
to
north
korea
told
reuters
kim
who
vowed
not
to
let
the
people
tighten
their
belt
again
in
his
public
speech
in
announced
in
april
a
shift
in
focus
from
nuclear
programmes
to
the
economy
analysts
say
that
will
be
difficult
while
sanctions
remain
in
place
i
don
t
think
there
is
an
outcry
in
the
markets
now
but
there
could
be
one
towards
the
end
of
this
year
