long drought puts pressure on dutch shipping sector
amsterdam
reuters
the
longest
drought
in
decades
is
drying
out
rivers
in
the
usually
wet
netherlands
hitting
cargo
traffic
and
threatening
a
shortage
of
bulk
supplies
ranging
from
hops
for
beer
brewers
to
cement
for
the
construction
sector
the
summer
of
looks
set
to
overtake
as
the
driest
one
on
record
in
the
netherlands
with
almost
no
rain
for
two
months
and
currently
not
expected
until
well
into
august
an
enduring
heat
wave
is
expected
to
take
temperatures
to
above
degrees
celsius
later
this
week
and
the
dutch
national
weather
institute
issued
a
warning
for
extreme
weather
on
tuesday
urging
people
to
take
precautions
water
in
important
rivers
such
as
the
rhine
and
ijssel
which
depend
on
rain
and
snow
has
fallen
below
critical
levels
severely
limiting
cargo
traffic
as
ships
can
only
be
used
for
a
fraction
of
their
normal
capacity
to
keep
them
afloat
many
large
ships
can
now
only
take
half
to
a
third
of
their
normal
loads
joost
sitskoorn
of
evofenedex
the
dutch
association
for
logistical
companies
told
reuters
a
lot
more
ships
are
needed
to
meet
demand
overcapacity
helped
counter
this
problem
for
a
while
but
the
supply
is
starting
to
dry
this
could
lead
to
shortages
in
a
range
of
goods
with
building
materials
cattle
feed
and
barley
and
hop
for
beer
brewers
first
in
line
sitskoorn
said
roughly
a
third
of
all
goods
transported
in
the
netherlands
move
over
water
with
the
sector
carrying
a
total
load
of
billion
kg
last
year
mostly
to
and
from
elsewhere
in
europe
over
half
of
the
freight
is
in
the
form
of
bulk
goods
such
as
iron
ore
sand
gravel
and
cement
which
are
impossible
to
shift
to
the
road
for
transport
as
it
takes
some
trucks
to
replace
only
one
small
cargo
ship
i
really
fear
for
a
situation
in
which
the
current
low
water
levels
persist
said
pim
van
baaren
director
of
the
van
nieuwpoort
group
a
large
supplier
of
building
materials
in
the
netherlands
we
can
manage
for
now
but
mainly
because
many
builders
are
away
for
the
transport
costs
have
already
risen
by
percent
van
baaren
said
while
the
demand
for
the
limited
amount
of
ships
available
is
rapidly
driving
up
prices
the
long
hot
summer
caused
new
obstacles
on
tuesday
when
amsterdam
closed
two
important
shipping
routes
through
its
canals
as
it
could
not
sufficiently
cool
its
iron
bridges
to
open
them
for
ships
this
caught
several
shippers
off
guard
as
they
were
suddenly
cut
off
from
their
customers
we
had
to
reroute
a
ship
filled
with
cement
for
an
important
customer
from
the
south
of
amsterdam
to
the
north
and
they
had
to
shut
their
factory
in
the
south
as
we
couldn
t
reach
them
