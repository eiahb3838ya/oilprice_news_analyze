colombia could create new system for oil round bidding amid delays
bogota
july
reuters
colombia
is
preparing
changes
to
its
bidding
process
for
oil
areas
in
an
effort
to
increase
investment
and
find
new
reserves
the
head
of
the
oil
regulator
said
after
repeated
cancellations
of
its
latest
oil
round
the
changes
including
contracts
adjusted
to
international
crude
price
fluctuations
and
the
chance
for
companies
to
propose
exploration
on
land
not
yet
on
offer
will
help
attract
spending
and
nearly
double
reserves
to
at
least
years
of
consumption
orlando
velandia
of
the
national
hydrocarbons
agency
anh
said
we
re
looking
to
improve
conditions
for
the
country
to
achieve
competitiveness
and
motivate
companies
to
make
proposals
about
areas
velandia
said
in
an
interview
on
monday
the
anh
in
april
postponed
the
deadline
to
receive
offers
for
onshore
areas
at
its
jacinto
auction
until
the
second
half
of
the
year
it
was
the
sixth
time
the
round
was
delayed
colombia
is
the
third
latin
american
country
hosting
oil
auctions
this
year
after
mexico
and
brazil
its
bidding
round
comes
after
a
pause
when
low
oil
prices
stopped
many
latin
american
countries
from
offering
acreage
colombia
has
been
awarding
blocks
to
the
highest
bidder
every
two
to
three
years
but
bidding
in
the
new
system
will
privilege
the
first
company
that
requests
access
to
additional
areas
velandia
said
likely
improving
the
offers
of
other
bidders
once
we
evaluate
the
areas
and
they
re
added
to
the
map
companies
can
make
offers
in
a
continual
competitive
process
velandia
said
companies
would
no
longer
be
required
to
outline
planned
investments
or
compensate
the
government
if
spending
falls
short
he
added
colombia
could
offer
at
least
onshore
and
offshore
caribbean
blocks
with
the
changes
velandia
said
companies
having
problems
with
social
protests
or
delays
in
environmental
licensing
could
be
offered
alternative
areas
he
said
protests
along
with
pipeline
bombings
are
a
major
headache
ecopetrol
lost
some
million
earlier
this
year
because
of
blockades
the
country
has
billion
barrels
of
reserves
equivalent
to
about
years
of
consumption
colombia
produces
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
half
for
export
the
proposed
changes
must
be
approved
by
the
anh
s
directive
counsel
which
includes
the
ministers
of
energy
and
finance
changes
not
approved
before
will
go
to
the
government
of
ivan
duque
who
has
promised
tax
cuts
investment
in
ecopetrol
s
refineries
and
a
crackdown
on
attacks
by
rebel
groups
