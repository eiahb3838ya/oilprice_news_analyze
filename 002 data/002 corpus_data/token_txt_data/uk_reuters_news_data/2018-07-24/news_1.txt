brazilian

has
chosen
to
enter
exclusive
talks
to
sell
two
shallow

backed

made
the
top
bid
for
the
pampo
and
enchova
clusters
located
in
the
campos
basin
off
the
coast
of
rio
de
janeiro
state
beating
out
trident
energy
a
warburg
firm
the
sources
said
the
deal
could
mark
eig
s
debut
in
the
oil
production
business
in
latin
america
s
top
producer
it
also
makes
strategic
sense
for
the
private

firm
which
earlier
this
year
bought
out
brazilian
logistics
company
prumo
logistica
operator
of
the
nearby
port

will
provide

for

whose
structure
and
value
were
not

world
class
geology
and
dwindling
reserves
mean
the
world
s
top
oil
majors
have
invested
billions
of
dollars
to
take
stakes
in
brazil
s
prolific
deep
water
oilfields
in
recent
months
but
smaller
oil
companies
are
often
better
than
large
ones
at
cutting
costs
and
some
have
honed
expertise
in
squeezing
more
oil
out
of
mature
fields
eig
will
follow
in
the
footsteps

throughout
brazil
but
none

a
sale
of
the
mature

clusters
would
also
make
financial
sense
for

it
seeks
to
