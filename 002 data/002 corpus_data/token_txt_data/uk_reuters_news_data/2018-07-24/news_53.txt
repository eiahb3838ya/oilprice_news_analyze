china's stricter rules on shipping emissions a boon for imo 2020 compliance -woodmac

tighter
rules
on
shipping
emissions
around
china
s
coastlines
from
the
start
of
next
year
is
a
clear
sign
the
world
s
no
economy
will
strive
for
percent
compliance
when
the
global
sulfur
emissions
cap
starts
in
consultants

said
on
tuesday
on
july
china
s
ministry
of
transport
announced
it
would
extend
its
emission
control
areas
ecas
to
include
the
country
s
entire
coastline
from
china
s
ecas
limit
the
sulfur
content
of
fuel
ships
can
burn
while
operating
in
the
ecas
to
percent
china
s
stricter
policies
for
marine
fuel
specifications
will
undoubtedly
play
an
important
part
in
meeting
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
global
sulfur
cap
said
wood
mackenzie
consultant
yujiao
lei
in
a
global
effort
to
combat
air
pollution
from
the
shipping
industry
the
imo
ruled
it
will
cut
the
sulfur
content
of
the
fuel
that
ships
can
burn
to
percent
by
january
from
percent
currently
but
questions
around
how
the
imo
will
implement
the
rules
and
ensure
compliance
have
given
rise
to
uncertainty
since
they
were
announced
in
yet
china
s
role
in
the
world
s
shipping
market
for
commodities
and
containers
as
well
as
the
large
number
of
international
and
domestic
vessels
calling
at
its
ports
the
new
regulations
could
be
significant
said
wood
mackenzie
consultant
yujiao
lei
for
shippers
however
the
impact
of
the
new
ecas
is
expected
to
be
limited
over
the
near
term
china
s
eca
extension
in
will
have
minimal
impact
for
sea
zones
since
a
majority
of
marine
traffic
is
currently
concentrated
in
the
existing
ecas
said
lei
also
china
s
ecas
only
reach
nautical
miles
out
to
sea
and
ships
generally
tend
to
slow
down
as
they
near
the
coast
so
fuel
consumption
in
these
areas
is
minimal
said
lei
there
will
be
more
upside
for
diesel
demand
from
china
s
coastal
areas
later
in
when
the
imo
global
sulfur
cap
takes
effect
said
lei
china
s
eca
extensions
come
amid
government
efforts
to
turn
some
of
its
major
ports
in
to
marine
refueling
or
bunkering
hubs
by
setting
up
zones
in
zhoushan
and
hainan
by
generating
this
demand
the
chinese
government
is
not
only
creating
a
bunkering
industry
but
also
providing
a
solution
for
its
refining
industry
s
diesel
surplus
said
lei
these
ambitions
could
come
at
the
expense
of
singapore
the
world
s
largest
marine
refueling
hub
additional
marine
fuel
demand
in
china
to
meet
imo
regulations
will
also
put
the
country
very
close
to
singapore
in
terms
of
total
marine
fuel
demand
said
lei
we
expect
barrels
per
day
around
million
tonnes
of
bunker
demand
to
shift
from
singapore
to
china
in
for
international
shipping
