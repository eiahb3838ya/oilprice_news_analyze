new biodiesel recipe can cut indonesia's fuel imports -industry minister
jakarta
reuters
indonesia
the
world
s
biggest
palm
oil
producer
is
offering
incentives
to
developers
of
a
new
percent
palm
green
diesel
which
the
net
oil
importer
hopes
can
replace
costly
fuel
imports
within
three
years
the
country
s
industry
minister
said
biodiesel
for
land
transportation
in
indonesia
currently
consists
of
a
percent
bio
component
that
is
mixed
with
petroleum
diesel
that
component
is
expected
to
be
raised
to
percent
in
in
indonesia
the
bio
portion
of
biodiesel
is
made
with
fatty
acid
methyl
esters
fame
from
palm
oil
but
efforts
to
increase
fame
concentrations
in
biodiesel
have
faced
resistance
from
regulators
as
well
as
the
automotive
and
oil
industries
while
biodiesel
can
cut
fuel
costs
and
reduce
emissions
higher
blends
of
fame
require
special
handling
and
equipment
as
the
fuel
has
a
solvent
effect
that
can
corrode
engine
seals
and
gasket
materials
and
it
can
solidify
at
cold
temperatures
but
according
to
industry
minister
airlangga
hartarto
indonesia
has
found
a
new
way
to
produce
biodiesel
that
is
not
based
on
fame
that
can
avoid
these
problems
we
already
have
a
prototype
and
in
three
years
we
will
be
ready
to
produce
it
hartarto
told
reuters
in
an
interview
last
week
green
diesel
made
completely
from
palm
oil
has
the
same
specifications
as
petrol
and
is
compliant
with
the
euro
iv
emissions
standard
said
hartarto
who
chairs
the
country
s
political
party
golkar
a
biorefinery
owned
by
elevance
renewable
sciences
and
wilmar
international
is
currently
producing
green
diesel
in
a
pilot
project
and
has
been
given
a
corporate
tax
discount
to
develop
output
hartarto
said
modifications
to
engines
and
machinery
wouldn
t
be
needed
because
its
specifications
are
the
same
as
biodiesel
he
added
it
s
actually
better
than
conventional
according
to
lila
harsyah
bakhtiar
an
official
at
the
industry
ministry
green
diesel
is
made
using
hydrotreated
vegetable
oil
a
technology
that
is
expensive
to
develop
but
which
could
avoid
disruptions
to
automakers
who
were
angry
over
repeated
changes
to
the
biodiesel
mix
elevance
and
wilmar
did
not
reply
to
requests
for
comments
according
to
its
website
elevance
uses
a
patented
process
at
its
refinery
in
gresik
east
java
to
produce
tonnes
of
modified
triglyceride
unsaturated
methyl
esters
and
olefins
per
year
indonesia
s
biodiesel
program
was
already
reducing
indonesia
s
fuel
import
demand
by
million
per
day
hartarto
said
adding
that
green
diesel
can
help
improve
our
trade
balance
and
strengthen
the
rupiah
while
creating
southeast
asia
s
largest
economy
is
among
the
region
s
most
vulnerable
to
external
factors
due
to
its
sizeable
current
account
deficit
and
its
large
fuel
imports
because
of
that
the
rupiah
has
been
among
the
hardest
hit
this
year
as
investors
have
sold
emerging
market
assets
indonesia
has
been
pushing
increases
in
domestic
palm
oil
consumption
to
cushion
a
possible
slowdown
in
export
demand
the
european
union
last
month
agreed
to
phase
out
the
use
of
palm
oil
in
transport
fuels
from
because
of
deforestation
concerns
indonesia
s
auto
industries
lobby
group
gaikindo
has
previously
said
increasing
biodiesel
blends
can
increase
fuel
consumption
and
may
lead
to
engines
overheating
hartarto
asserted
that
green
diesel
generated
percent
fewer
emissions
than
conventional
fossil
fuels
however
a
study
funded
by
the
european
commission
found
that
among
vegetable
oils
palm
and
soybean
oils
generated
the
highest
indirect
greenhouse
gas
emissions
because
of
deforestation
and
the
drainage
of
peatlands
associated
with
their
cultivation
indonesia
is
expected
to
consume
million
to
million
kilolitres
of
fame
this
year
below
an
earlier
target
of
million
kilolitres
according
to
the
indonesia
estate
crop
fund
the
indonesia
biofuel
producers
association
expects
unblended
biodiesel
exports
to
reach
kilolitres
this
year
