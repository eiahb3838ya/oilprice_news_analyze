filed
the
suit

the
of
oil
from
the
northern
chayvo
oilfield
controlled
by
rosneft

northern
chayvo
field
is
adjacent
to
the
concession
area
controlled
by
the
consortium
it
is
commonplace
in
the
oil
industry
for
extraction
activities
on
one
concession
to
influence
oil
flows
on
a
neighbouring
permit
because
the
oil
lies
in
rock
formations
that
straddle
two
or
more
permits
since
oil
can
be
determined
by
an
examination
most

resolved
