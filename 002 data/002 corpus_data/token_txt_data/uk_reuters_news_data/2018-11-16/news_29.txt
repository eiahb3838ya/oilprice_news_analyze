paradise
reuters
a
search
for
victims
of
a
catastrophic
blaze
that
reduced
a
northern
california
town
to
ashes
intensified
on
thursday
as
authorities
expanded
to
the
number
of
those
reported
missing
in
the
deadliest
and
most
destructive
wildfire
in
state
history
at
least
people
have
been
confirmed
dead
in
the
camp
fire
which
erupted
a
week
ago
in
the
sierra
foothills
miles
km
north
of
san
francisco
and
now
ranks
as
one
of
the
most
lethal
single
wildfires
since
the
turn
of
the
last
century
authorities
attributed
the
high
death
toll
in
part
to
the
staggering
speed
with
which
the
flames
fuelled
by
desiccated
scrub
and
trees
raced
with
little
warning
through
paradise
a
town
of
nearly
homes
and
buildings
including
most
of
the
town
were
incinerated
last
thursday
night
hours
after
the
blaze
erupted
the
california
department
of
forestry
and
fire
protection
cal
fire
has
said
what
was
left
was
a
ghostly
smoky
expanse
of
empty
lots
covered
in
ash
and
strewn
with
twisted
wreckage
and
debris
thousands
of
additional
structures
were
still
threatened
by
the
blaze
and
as
many
as
people
were
under
evacuation
orders
at
the
height
of
the
blaze
an
army
of
firefighters
many
from
distant
states
laboured
to
contain
and
suppress
the
flames
the
revised
official
roster
of
individuals
whose
whereabouts
and
fate
remained
unknown
is
more
than
double
the
listed
earlier
in
the
day
by
the
butte
county
sheriff
s
office
sheriff
kory
honea
said
nearly
people
initially
reported
as
unaccounted
for
had
been
found
alive
he
said
the
list
of
missing
would
keep
fluctuating
with
names
being
added
and
others
removed
either
because
they
turn
up
safe
or
are
identified
among
the
dead
the
higher
confirmed
death
toll
and
rising
number
of
those
unaccounted
for
were
revealed
at
an
evening
news
briefing
by
honea
who
said
the
remains
of
seven
more
camp
fire
victims
had
been
located
since
wednesday
s
tally
of
the
sheriff
has
asked
relatives
of
the
missing
to
submit
dna
samples
to
hasten
identification
of
the
dead
but
he
acknowledged
some
of
those
unaccounted
for
may
never
be
conclusively
found
the
butte
county
disaster
coincided
with
a
flurry
of
smaller
blazes
in
southern
california
including
the
woolsey
fire
which
has
been
linked
with
three
fatalities
and
destroyed
at
least
structures
in
the
mountains
and
foothills
near
the
malibu
coast
west
of
los
angeles
the
latest
blazes
have
capped
a
pair
of
calamitous
wildfire
seasons
in
california
that
scientists
largely
attribute
to
prolonged
drought
they
say
is
symptomatic
of
climate
change
the
cause
of
the
fires
are
under
investigation
but
two
electric
utilities
have
said
they
sustained
equipment
problems
close
to
the
origins
of
the
blazes
around
the
time
they
were
reported
the
white
house
said
on
thursday
that
president
donald
trump
who
has
been
criticized
as
having
politicized
the
fires
by
casting
blame
on
forest
mismanagement
plans
to
visit
the
fire
zones
on
saturday
to
meet
displaced
residents
cal
fire
said
that
percent
of
the
camp
fire
s
perimeter
had
been
contained
up
from
percent
even
as
the
blaze
footprint
grew
acres
to
acres
hectares
containment
of
the
woolsey
fire
grew
to
percent
but
smoke
and
soot
spread
far
and
wide
public
schools
in
sacramento
and
districts
miles
km
to
the
south
and
as
far
away
as
san
francisco
and
oakland
said
friday
s
classes
would
be
cancelled
as
the
camp
fire
worsened
air
quality
those
who
survived
the
flames
but
lost
homes
were
moving
in
temporarily
with
friends
or
relatives
or
bunking
down
in
american
red
cross
shelters
at
a
shelter
set
in
a
church
in
nearby
oroville
a
bulletin
board
was
plastered
with
dozens
of
photos
of
missing
people
along
with
messages
and
phone
numbers
church
officials
posted
lists
of
names
they
received
in
phone
calls
from
people
searching
for
friends
and
family
evacuees
are
asked
to
check
the
boards
to
see
if
their
names
appear
many
others
found
haven
at
an
encampment
that
sprang
up
in
the
parking
lot
outside
a
walmart
store
in
paradise
where
dozens
of
evacuees
pitched
tents
or
slept
in
their
cars
part
of
the
lot
was
roped
off
as
a
distribution
centre
for
clothes
food
and
coffee
portable
toilets
were
also
brought
in
evacuees
milling
in
the
parking
lot
faced
morning
temperatures
that
dropped
to
just
above
freezing
and
many
wore
breathing
masks
for
protection
from
lingering
smoke
nicole
and
eric
montague
along
with
their
daughter
showed
up
for
free
food
but
have
been
living
with
extended
family
in
the
neighbouring
city
of
chico
in
a
apartment
filled
with
people
and
nine
dogs
they
recounted
being
stunned
at
how
swiftly
the
fire
roared
through
paradise
the
first
night
we
didn
t
have
any
time
to
react
eric
said
the
news
didn
t
even
know
the
fire
was
coming
it
just
happened
so
nicole
said
she
fled
once
her
home
s
mailbox
caught
fire
and
neighbours
propane
tanks
began
exploding
facing
walls
of
flames
and
traffic
gridlock
her
evacuation
with
her
daughter
was
so
harrowing
that
she
called
her
husband
to
say
farewell
i
called
him
and
said
honey
i
m
not
going
to
make
it
i
