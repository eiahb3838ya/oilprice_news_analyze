and
bolster
the

duque
who
has
been
in
office
for
days
pledged
during
his
campaign
to
lower
taxes
on
businesses
and
improve
security
for
crude
producers
in
the
country
where
leftist
rebels
regularly
bomb
pipelines
and
community
protests
sometimes
stymie
output
we
re
seeing
progress
we
have
all
the
confidence
in
the
world
in
the
administration
said
occidental
petroleum
chief
executive
vicki
hollub
on
the
sidelines
of
an
oil
and
gas
conference
in
bogota
occidental
operates
the
cano
limon
field
in
eastern
arauca
province
the
cano
limon
pipeline
run
by
state
oil
company
ecopetrol
has
been
offline
for
most
of
the
year
because
of
attacks
by
the
national
liberation
army
eln
rebels
production
and
exports
from
the
field
have
remained
normal
despite
the
bombings
because
ecopetrol
is
able
to
use
the
smaller
bicentenario
pipeline
for
transport
though
the
pipeline
is
currently
shut
it
was
attacked
repeatedly
last
weekend
hollub
who
said
occidental
hopes
to
more
than
double
its
barrels
per
day
net
output
in
the
coming
years
was
optimistic
about
the
security
situation
the
military
is
incredible
oil
companies
may
be
among
those
who
benefit
from
a
proposed
tax
cut
to
corporations
that
is
wending
its
way
through
congress
the
government
wants
to
reduce
duties
on
businesses
to
percent
over
the
next
four
years
down
from
percent
other
private
producers
were
more
cautious
it
s
still
early
but
all
the
signs
are
positive
said
frontera
energy
chief
executive
richard
herbert
what
we
need
now
is
security
in
prospective
less
developed
areas
he
said
adding
that
blocks
won
by
frontera
back
in
in
southern
caqueta
and
putumayo
provinces
have
not
been
developed
because
of
ongoing
security
worries
herbert
said
he
hoped
there
would
be
a
new
bidding
round
in
so
further
oil
areas
could
be
opened
to
exploration
colombia
has
repeatedly
delayed
its
deadline
to
receive
offers
for
onshore
areas
at
its
jacinto
auction
the
round
would
be
the
first
since
frontera
estimates
its
average
production
will
end
at
bpd
some
of
which
comes
from
fields
in
colombia

at
the
close
of
the
conference
mines
and
energy
minister
maria
fernanda
suarez
said
she
was
confident
the
oil
sector
would
continue
to
contribute
to
the
country
s
development
and
its
bid
to
become
