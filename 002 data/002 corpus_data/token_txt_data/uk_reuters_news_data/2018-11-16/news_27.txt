said
in
the
country

moresby
on

that
physical
terms
had
been
agreed
he
said
negotiations
over
how
revenue
would
be
shared
in
the
community
and
provincial

required
more
work
i
d
say
we
are
almost
to

through

about
our
understanding
of
revenue
sharing

in
response
to
questions
from

disagreements
over
rights
and
agreements
have
been
an
almost
constant
feature
of
resource
development
in

a
memorandum
of
understanding
mou
signed
on
friday
is
basically
a
commitment
by
the
government
to
finalise
a
gas
agreement
in
early
which
would
lead
to
the
development
of
papua
lng
run
by
total
the
signing
was
held
on
the
sidelines
of
the
economic
cooperation
forum
where
total
chief
executive
patrick
pouyanne
said
he
hoped
to
make
progress
on
the
agreement
quickly
there
is
still
some
work
to
be
done
but
we
are
ambitious
and
i
d
love
to
come
back
not
in
two
years
but
in
months
or
before
pouyanne
said
papua
lng
will
supply
gas
from
the

for
two

exxon
said
in
an
emailed
comment
that
it
was
pleased
to
see
progress
on
the
papua
lng
talks
oil
search
a
partner
in
both
papua
lng
and
png
lng
said
all
parties
were
aligned
on
the
need
to
ensure
that
new
lng
developments
in
png
remain
competitive
with
other
new
lng
projects
worldwide
the
companies
are
racing
to
start
exporting
from
the
new
trains
by
when
the
lng
market
is
expected
to
need
new
supply
to
meet
rapidly
growing
demand
in
asia
but
analysts
say
that
timeline
might
be
hard
to
meet
as
a
final
investment
decision
may
not
come
until
or
ultimately
the
timeline
for
papua
will
be
dictated
by
exxon
s
patient
and
disciplined
centralised
decision
making
process
and
all
other
parties
will
just
need
to
fall
in
line
with
that
said
credit
suisse
analyst
saul
kavonic
analysts
estimate
the
expansion
will
cost
around
billion
well
below
the
billion
cost
of
the
original
project
which
involved
building
a
wide
range
of
infrastructure
from
scratch
including
a
pipeline
through
the
nation
s
rugged
highlands
down
to
the
coast
the
government
is
aiming
to
strike
better
fiscal
terms
for
the
country
than
it
did
with
exxon
mobil
s
png
lng
project
in
when
it
was
looking
secure
the
biggest
foreign
investment
in
the
country
amid
the
global
financial
crisis
