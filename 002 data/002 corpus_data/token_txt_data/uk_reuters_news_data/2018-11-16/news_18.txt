update 7-regulator 'stunned and terrified' after causing pg&e stock surge
reuters
the
chief
of
california
s
top
utilities
regulator
said
on
friday
he
was
shocked
to
learn
that
reassurances
he
made
to
investors
about
pg
e
caused
the
embattled
power
utility
s
stock
to
surge
over
percent
in
a
matter
of
minutes
pg
e
s
stock
had
slumped
over
percent
since
the
state
s
wildfire
broke
out
last
week
on
fears
that
without
help
from
california
s
government
the
utility
could
go
bankrupt
should
it
eventually
be
found
responsible
the
fire
destroyed
the
town
of
paradise
and
has
killed
at
least
people
california
public
utilities
commission
president
michael
picker
told
reuters
on
friday
that
utilities
must
be
able
to
borrow
money
cheaply
in
order
to
properly
serve
ratepayers
that
echoed
comments
he
made
on
an
investor
conference
call
organized
by
bank
of
america
on
thursday
when
he
said
he
could
not
imagine
allowing
the
state
s
largest
utility
to
go
into
bankruptcy
picker
was
surprised
hours
later
on
thursday
to
learn
that
pg
e
s
stock
had
surged
over
percent
in
extended
trading
in
reaction
to
his
comments
i
was
stunned
and
terrified
picker
said
i
left
the
call
yesterday
and
i
went
back
to
a
workshop
i
was
in
so
i
didn
t
find
out
about
it
until
several
hours
picker
s
remarks
to
a
private
group
were
unusual
in
part
because
public
companies
and
their
executives
must
follow
federal
rules
aimed
at
avoiding
selective
disclosure
of
material
news
but
a
government
official
or
other
outside
parties
sharing
an
outlook
on
a
public
company
does
not
face
the
same
obligations
experts
say
pg
e
shares
on
friday
closed
up
percent
at
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
the
stock
is
still
down
about
percent
from
before
the
fire
started
erasing
nearly
billion
in
market
capitalization
the
cause
of
the
camp
fire
that
destroyed
the
town
of
paradise
remains
under
investigation
with
pg
e
potentially
facing
mounting
costs
from
wildfires
the
regulator
would
also
consider
potential
options
to
restructure
the
company
including
separating
its
electricity
and
gas
units
picker
told
reuters
keeping
wall
street
interested
in
investing
in
pg
e
and
other
california
utilities
is
key
to
reducing
the
state
s
carbon
emissions
and
making
the
power
system
more
efficient
he
said
i
don
t
think
we
people
but
we
want
to
make
sure
that
we
can
continue
to
keep
the
lights
on
and
be
cleaner
and
cleaner
and
ideally
more
graphic

regulator
comments
california
state
senator
bill
dodd
told
reuters
it
was
too
soon
to
speculate
about
future
legislation
that
might
provide
relief
to
pg
e
in
case
it
is
found
liable
for
the
camp
fire
dodd
sponsored
legislation
passed
this
year
that
lets
utilities
pass
some
of
the
costs
related
to
liability
from
wildfires
on
to
ratepayers
but
the
bill
did
not
specifically
provide
for
graphic
fire
fear
citigroup
on
friday
upgraded
pg
e
s
stock
to
buy
from
given
the
reaction
in
the
stock
market
we
think
there
was
an
appropriate
level
of
urgency
that
something
needed
to
be
done
citigroup
analysts
wrote
referring
to
the
regulator
s
statement
the
price
for
pg
e
s
more
than
billion
of
bonds
also
rose
the
price
of
the
march
bond
was
up
about
points
in
afternoon
trading
after
earlier
trading
as
much
as
points
higher
pg
e
s
debt
was
pressured
earlier
this
week
after
the
utility
borrowed
billion
under
its
credit
lines
and
warned
it
could
face
liabilities
in
excess
of
its
insurance
coverage
should
its
equipment
be
found
to
have
caused
the
fire
the
gains
in
bond
prices
came
even
after
both
moody
s
investors
service
and
standard
poor
s
cut
their
credit
ratings
on
pg
e
late
thursday
to
just
one
notch
above
junk
bond
territory
and
said
the
outlook
remained
negative
fitch
ratings
on
friday
also
downgraded
the
utility
s
issuer
default
ratings
with
the
collapse
in
its
bond
prices
this
week
most
of
pg
e
s
bonds
were
trading
as
though
they
were
already
securities
although
friday
s
recovery
brought
many
of
them
back
in
line
with
comparably
corporate
bonds
pg
e
has
about
million
of
floating
rate
notes
maturing
in
two
weeks
and
does
not
face
another
maturing
security
until
october
that
october
million
bond
with
a
percent
coupon
yielded
more
than
percent
at
one
point
in
trading
on
thursday
the
first
of
pg
e
s
securities
to
have
breached
that
threshold
on
friday
the
october
note
was
up
more
than
points
to
cents
on
the
dollar
with
the
yield
dropping
to
percent
shares
of
edison
international
whose
southern
california
edison
subsidiary
provides
power
in
southern
california
jumped
percent
while
investors
view
it
as
at
less
risk
than
pg
e
to
massive
liabilities
from
wildfires
its
stock
has
been
volatile
over
the
past
week
as
a
second
fire
burned
in
that
region
the
woolsey
fire
in
southern
california
also
remains
under
investigation
the
volatility
in
pg
e
shares
has
drawn
a
rush
of
trading
in
options
traders
are
betting
the
stock
will
remain
prone
to
wild
gyrations

the
near
term
