crude
oil
futures
were
up
cents
at
a

prices
were
mainly
supported
by
expectations
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
would
start
withholding
supply
soon
fearing
a
renewed
rout
such
as
in
when
prices
crashed
under
the
weight
of
oversupply
however
morgan
stanley
warned
a
cut
by
the
middle
east
dominated
producer
cartel
may
not
have
the
desired
effect
the
main
oil
price
benchmarks
brent
and
wti
are
both
crudes
and
reflect
this
glut
the
bank
said
opec
production
cuts
are
usually
implemented
by
removing
medium
and
heavier
barrels
from
the
market
but
that
does
not
address
the
oversupply
of
due
to
the
structural
oversupply
that
has
emerged
in
the
market
from
record
production
by
many
countries
morgan
stanley
said
that
opec
cuts
are
inherently
temporary
because
all
they
can
do
is
shift
production
from
one
period
to
another
while
opec
considers
withholding
supply
crude

reached
another
record
last

at

surged

almost
a
quarter

the

crude

soared

in
the

to
to

the
highest
level
since
early
december
this
surge
contributed
to
oil
prices
falling
by
around
a
quarter
since
early
october
taking
many
by
surprise
oil
bulls
us
included
have
capitulated

no

see

said
those

who
are
able
to
adopt
a
contrarian
stance
and
stomach
the
volatility
are
being
presented
with
an
excellent
investment
opportunity
to
buy
into

after
the

agreed
saying
we
believe

is
oversold

likely
bounce
