dutch government appeals order to speed up climate change battle
amsterdam
reuters
the
dutch
government
on
friday
said
it
would
ask
the
country
s
highest
court
to
overturn
a
ruling
ordering
it
to
speed
up
reductions
in
greenhouse
gas
emissions
last
month
an
appeals
court
upheld
a
ruling
ordering
the
government
to
ensure
are
at
least
percent
below
levels
by
the
end
of
saying
the
government
had
not
done
enough
to
prevent
the
dangers
of
climate
change
the
government
said
it
would
adhere
to
the
ruling
but
questioned
whether
the
court
was
allowed
to
rule
on
its
policies
this
can
have
large
consequences
for
future
governments
and
their
room
for
making
policies
on
climate
or
any
other
subject
economy
minister
eric
wiebes
said
in
a
statement
last
year
emissions
were
only
percent
lower
than
levels
in
the
netherlands
which
is
among
the
most
pollutant
countries
in
the
europe
union
despite
its
limited
achievements
in
recent
years
the
government
expects
current
plans
to
reduce
emissions
to
percent
below
the
figure
by
the
deadline
however
uncertainty
around
the
goals
coupled
with
the
court
ruling
could
force
the
government
to
take
drastic
measures
to
reach
them
including
the
immediate
shutdown
of
one
or
more
power
plants
experts
have
said
in
may
the
netherlands
said
it
would
ban
the
use
of
coal
in
electricity
generation
in
the
coming
decade
shutting
down
two
of
its
five
plants
