perceived
as
safer

across
a
range
of
asset
classes
and
rapid
deleveraging
like
that
seen

they

the

market
has
been
such
that
cash
has
outperformed
stocks
and
bonds
this
year
for
the
first
time
since
the
strategists
said
noting
that
despite
this
billion
has
flowed
into
equities
billion
into
money
market
funds
and
billion
into
bonds
this
week
saw
modest

the
strategists
wrote
and
the

which
they
see
climbing
further
into
the
end
of
this
year
and
first
quarter
of
before
falling
in
terms
of
regional

investors
pulled
billion
from
european
equity
funds
which
have
seen

for
of
the
past
weeks
equities
the
world
leaders
in
terms
of
performance
and
valuations
saw
billion
of
inflows
a
nascent
appetite
for
emerging
market
stocks
was
visible
with
billion
going
into
the
region
its
fifth
straight
week
of

graphic
growth
stocks
begin
to
capitulate
nov
apple
which
baml
strategists
labeled
the
king
of
buybacks
has
cracked
they
said
as
the
stock
fell
to
below
its
moving
average
a
level
seen
as
important
for
sentiment
apple
shares
are
on
course
for
their
worst
month
since
april
and
have
suffered
seven
consecutive
weeks
of
losses
as
the
iphone
maker
s
weak
results
and
stress
in
the
semiconductor
space
dented
the
stock
its
recent
decline
signals
share
buybacks
which
have
been
a
key
driver
of
the
rapid
rise
of
stocks
are
no
longer
sufficient
to
fuel
the
market
this
year
has
seen
a
record
billion
of
buybacks
so
far
yet
the
s
p
buyback
index
which
tracks
the
performance
of
the
stocks
in
the
index
with
the
highest
buyback
ratios
is
up
just
percent
and
down
percent
this
quarter
the
recent
decline
of
tech
stocks
like
apple
which
had
led
the
market
higher
is
one
symptom
of
a
building
rotation
from
growth
stocks
into
value
stocks
further
evidenced
this
week
with
billion
flowing
into
funds
and
billion
leaking
out
of
funds
defensive
steady
revenue
and
high
dividend
yielding
sectors
like
healthcare
and
utilities
also
led
the
way
in
terms
of

into
healthcare
funds
and
