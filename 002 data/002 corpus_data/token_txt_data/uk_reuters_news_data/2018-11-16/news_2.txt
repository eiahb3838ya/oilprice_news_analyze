opec
is
likely
to
be
spurred
to
action
as
production
continues
to
climb
he
said
still
the
day
s
gains
were
likely
to
be
limited
as
traders
were
cautious
going
into
the
weekend
he
said
it
would
take
a
brave
soul
to
go
home
really
long
this
weekend
considering
the
slaughter
we
ve
had
in
the
past
eight
opec
ministers
meet
on
in
vienna
to
decide
on
production
policy
for
the
next
six
months

another
record
last

said
in
its
closely
followed
report
the
rig
count
is
seen
as
an
indicator
of
future
production
growth
the
united
states
imposed
sanctions
on
iranian
oil
exports
this
month
and
iranian
crude
exports
have
fallen
sharply
in
recent
months
although
washington
cushioned
the
blow
by
granting
some
temporary
exemptions
other
oil
producers
have
more
than
compensated
for
the
lost
iranian
oil
and
most
analysts
now
see
a
significant
supply
surplus
with
inventories
building
putting
pressure
on
prices
fearing
a
repeat
of
the
price
rout
opec
is
widely
expected
to
start
trimming
output
soon
this
could
produce
a
swift
price
rebound
some
analysts
say
especially
if
production
falls
further
in
venezuela
and
libya
we
are
likely
from
december
onwards
to
have
at
least
million
barrels
