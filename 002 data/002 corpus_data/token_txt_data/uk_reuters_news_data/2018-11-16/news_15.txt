the
nordic
region
s
most
cruise
fleet
operator
is
refitting
its
ships
to
make
them
less
polluting
and
plans
to
use
a
byproduct
of
rotten
fish
to
help
power
their
new
leaner
engines
norway
s
hurtigruten
best
known
for
the
ships
that
ferry
tourists
along
the
country
s
fjords
and
coastline
and
up
into
the
arctic
is
investing
billion
crowns
million
over
three
years
to
adapt
its
fleet
six
of
its
older
vessels
will
be
retrofitted
to
run
on
a
combination
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
electric
batteries
and
liquefied
bio

we
are
talking
about
an

hurtigruten
ceo
daniel
skjeldam
told
reuters
in
an
interview
our
main
aim
is
to
improve
and
cut
emissions
he
said
hurtigruten
also
the
world
s
biggest
expedition
cruise
operator
to
destinations
including
antarctica
svalbard
and
greenland
is
also
ordering
three
new
ships
that
will
run
on
electricity
with
a
diesel
engine
only
as
the
shipping
sector
is
facing
tougher
international
regulations
including
cuts
in
emissions
by
at
least
percent
by
compared
with
levels
and
a
ban
on
fuels
with
sulphur
content
above
percent
from
against
percent
now
hurtigruten
wants
to
be
carbon
neutral
by
we
definitely
have
to
be
there
in
as
a
company
and
the
cruise
industry
must
definitely
have
to
come
a
long
way
as
well
said
skjeldam
two
of
the
electric
ships
costing
above
million
euros
each
are
already
under
construction
while
hurtigruten
has
a
letter
of
intent
for
a
third
that
will
help
hurtigruten
market
itself
as
a
green
cruise
company
especially
useful
given
the
vulnerable
its
ships
sail
through
the
changes
in
the
arctic
over
the
past
years
are
not
caused
by
carbon
dioxide
emissions
in
the
arctic
but
you
can
see
the
effects
of
the
emissions
elsewhere
in
the
world
first
in
the
arctic
