oslo
reuters
it
could
take
more
than
a
year
to
recover
funds
from
a
trader
whose
default
forced
members
of
the
nasdaq
commodities
exchange
to
plug
a
million
hole
two
market
participants
told
reuters
a
day
after
the
trader
struck
a
deal
with
creditors
the
deal
which
two
sources
said
would
return
at
least
half
of
the
funds
lost
allows
einar
aas
to
avoid
bankruptcy
and
keep
his
home
in
norway
though
he
will
have
to
auction
other
assets
in
norway
and
spain
Î±
lot
of
the
assets
will
take
a
lot
of
time
to
liquidate
the
timespan
could
easily
be
more
than
a
year

chief

of
nordstroem
invest
a
nasdaq
clearing
member
that
trades
power
the
derivative
trader
s
default
was
caused
by
strong
fluctuations
in
regional
power
market
spreads
in
early
september
as
heavy
rain
had
pushed
down
prices
in
the
nordic
region
while
a
spike
in
the
cost
of
carbon
drove
up
german
prices
a
source
at
one
of
nasdaq
s
largest
clearing
members
who
had
direct
knowledge
of
the
deal
s
details
and
did
not
want
to
be
identified
also
said
recovering
the
money
would
take
time
evaluating
the
assets
across
countries
organizing
and
conducting
auctions
reaching
a
conclusion
on
how
to
distribute
the
proceeds
it
will
take
years
not
months
the
source
said
aas
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
reuters
request
for
comment
some
members
contacted
by
reuters
said
they
were
satisfied
with
the
deal
creditors
struck
though
some
were
still
awaiting
answers
on
how
the
default
occurred
we
are
very
happy
with
the
deal
as
it
avoids
bankruptcy
which
was
a
risky
scenario
there
is
still
the
question
of
how
could
this
happen
it
is
not
something
you
forget
investor
relations
manager
maans
holmberg
at
finland
s
fortum
said
at
least
one
firm
was
publicly
unhappy
agder
energi
the
only
firm
that
initially
opposed
the
settlement
according
to
nasdaq
said
it
had
agreed
to
participate
because
not
doing
so
would
only
have
delayed
the
process
it
the
deal
is
unbalanced
steffen
syvertsen
agder
energi
s
director
of
energy
management
and
trading
told
reuters
as
long
as
it
was
not
possible
to
change
the
agreement
but
only
slow
down
the
process
with
increased
costs
we
therefore
decided
to
nasdaq
said
it
did
not
want
to
speculate
on
the
final
outcome
of
the
process
declining
to
estimate
how
much
money
would
be
recovered
