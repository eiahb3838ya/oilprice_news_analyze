the
search
for
victims
of
a
catastrophic
blaze
that
reduced
a
northern
california
town
to
ashes
intensified
on
thursday
as
authorities
posted
an
expanded
list
of
nearly
people
reported
missing
in
the
deadliest
and
most
destructive
wildfire
in
california
history
at
least
people
have
been
confirmed
dead
so
far
in
the
camp
fire
which
erupted
a
week
ago
in
the
sierra
foothills
miles
km
north
of
san
francisco
and
now
ranks
as
one
of
the
most
lethal
single
wildfires
since
the
turn
of
the
last
century
authorities
attributed
the
high
death
toll
in
part
to
the
staggering
speed
with
which
the
flames
fueled
by
desiccated
scrub
raced
through
paradise
a
town
of
residents
nearly
homes
and
other
buildings
including
most
of
the
town
were
incinerated
last
thursday
night
hours
after
the
blaze
erupted
according
to
the
california
department
of
forestry
and
fire
protection
cal
fire
what
was
left
was
a
ghostly
smoky
expanse
of
empty
lots
covered
in
ash
and
strewn
with
twisted
wreckage
and
debris
thousands
of
additional
structures
were
still
threatened
by
the
blaze
and
as
many
as
people
remained
under
evacuation
orders
an
army
of
firefighters
many
from
distant
states
labored
to
contain
and
suppress
the
flames
the
revised
official
roster
of
individuals
whose
whereabouts
and
fate
remained
unknown
is
more
than
double
the
number
of
people
butte
county
sheriff
kory
honea
said
on
wednesday
night
had
been
reported
missing
by
loved
ones
honea
said
the
list
of
missing
would
fluctuate
as
more
names
are
added
and
others
are
removed
either
because
they
turn
up
safe
or
come
to
be
identified
among
the
dead
the
sheriff
has
asked
relatives
of
the
missing
to
submit
dna
samples
to
hasten
identification
of
the
dead
but
he
acknowledged
some
of
those
unaccounted
for
may
never
be
conclusively
found
the
butte
county
disaster
coincided
with
a
flurry
of
smaller
blazes
in
southern
california
most
notably
the
woolsey
fire
which
has
been
linked
with
three
fatalities
and
destroyed
at
least
structures
in
the
mountains
and
foothills
near
the
malibu
coast
west
of
los
angeles
the
latest
blazes
have
capped
a
pair
of
calamitous
wildfire
seasons
in
california
that
scientists
largely
attribute
to
prolonged
drought
they
say
is
symptomatic
of
climate
change
the
white
house
said
on
thursday
that
president
donald
trump
who
has
been
criticized
as
having
politicized
the
fires
by
casting
blame
on
forest
mismanagement
plans
to
visit
the
fire
zones
on
saturday
to
meet
with
displaced
residents
fire
officials
said
the
woolsey
fire
had
little
to
do
with
forest
management
because
it
occurred
mostly
in
dry
brush
chaparral
and
oak
woodlands
and
the
paradise
fire
began
in
an
area
consisting
primarily
of
private
timber
and
scrub
not
managed
by
the
government
cal
fire
said
that
percent
of
the
camp
fire
s
perimeter
had
been
contained
up
from
percent
even
as
the
footprint
of
the
blaze
grew
acres
to
acres
hectares
containment
of
the
woolsey
fire
grew
to
percent
those
who
survived
the
flames
but
lost
their
homes
were
adapting
to
a
refugee
lifestyle
and
many
found
a
haven
at
a
walmart
store
in
paradise
a
section
of
the
store
s
parking
lot
was
roped
off
for
use
as
a
distribution
center
for
clothes
food
and
coffee
while
people
who
fled
their
homes
set
up
dozens
of
tents
in
an
adjacent
field
or
slept
in
their
cars
in
the
parking
lot
portable
toilets
were
brought
in
evacuees
milling
in
the
parking
lot
faced
morning
temperatures
that
dropped
into
the
fahrenheit
and
many
wore
breathing
masks
for
protection
from
lingering
smoke
nicole
and
eric
montague
along
with
their
daughter
went
to
the
walmart
parking
lot
for
free
food
but
have
been
living
with
extended
family
in
nearby
chico
in
a
apartment
filled
with
people
and
nine
dogs
they
recounted
being
stunned
at
how
swiftly
the
fire
roared
through
paradise
we
didn
t
have
any
time
to
react
eric
said
the
news
didn
t
even
know
the
fire
was
coming
it
just
happened
so
nicole
said
she
decided
to
flee
once
her
home
s
mailbox
caught
fire
and
neighbors
propane
tanks
began
exploding
with
approaching
flames
and
immovable
traffic
her
evacuation
with
her
daughter
was
so
harrowing
that
she
called
eric
to
say
they
were
going
to
die
i
called
him
and
said
honey
i
m
not
going
to
make
it
i
love
you
