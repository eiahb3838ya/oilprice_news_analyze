berlin

germany
s
phasing
out
of
power
stations
could
be
delayed
beyond
if
the
deadline
creates
problems
for
the
security
of
electricity
supply
a
senior
legislator
in
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
party
said
the
proposed
last
saturday
by
a
commission
tasked
with
mapping
out
germany
s
transition
to
a
more
environmentally
friendly
economy
drew
criticism
from
some
in
industry
who
fear
the
impact
of
higher
energy
prices
but
in
remarks
that
appeared
aimed
at
the
right
of
a
party
not
always
comfortable
with
merkel
s
centrist
approach
ralph
brinkhaus
chair
of
the
conservative
benches
in
parliament
said
it
was
crucial
not
to
be
dogmatic
in
pursuing
a
goal
that
was
widely
accepted
energy
supply
security
must
be
guaranteed
he
told
welt
am
sonntag
newspaper
if
it
is
endangered
we
should
be
free
to
do
another
round
and
address
that
without
abandoning
the
path
we
ve
chosen
there
s
no
reason
to
be
dogmatic
about
brinkhaus
from
the
christian
democrats
cdu
most
wing
last
year
toppled
a
merkel
ally
in
the
race
for
the
influential
parliamentary
leader
post
precipitating
the
sequence
of
events
that
led
to
merkel
resigning
as
party
leader
and
announcing
that
this
would
be
her
last
term
as
chancellor
that
sparked
a
fight
for
the
soul
of
the
party
whose
members
have
chafed
at
the
centrist
course
that
merkel
plotted
over
the
years
of
her
chancellorship
during
which
time
she
has
often
seemed
closer
to
leftists
and
greens
than
some
in
her
own
party
while
her
ally
annegret
s
narrow
victory
in
the
race
to
succeed
her
as
party
leader
was
seen
as
a
win
for
her
centrist
vision
brinkhaus
s
remarks
are
a
reminder
that
the
party
s
right
has
not
gone
away
as
the
cdu
gears
up
for
a
series
of
tough
european
and
regional
elections
the
coal
commission
unveiled
its
compromise
after
marathon
talks
early
last
saturday
proposing
to
shut
gw
of
coal
capacity
by
and
promised
billion
euros
to
help
regions
affected
by
the
end
of
coal
mining
brinkhaus
also
called
in
the
interview
for
a
rethink
on
government
spending
do
we
have
too
many
regulations
or
even
a
nanny
state
he
asked
an
insa
poll
for
bild
newspaper
on
saturday
showed
that
the
cdu
is
still
by
far
the
most
popular
party
on
percent
but
a
disappointing
election
year
could
yet
the
internal
party
war
