iran
displayed
a
new
cruise
missile
with
a
range
of
km
miles
on
saturday
during
celebrations
marking
the
anniversary
of
the
islamic
revolution
state
television
reported
iran
has
expanded
its
missile
programme
particularly
its
ballistic
missiles
in
defiance
of
opposition
from
the
united
states
and
expressions
of
concern
by
european
countries
tehran
says
the
programme
is
purely
defensive
later
on
saturday
a
senior
revolutionary
guard
commander
suggested
that
pressure
by
european
countries
for
talks
on
curbing
iran
s
ballistic
missiles
development
could
prompt
tehran
to
expand
it
beyond
current
limits
speaking
during
the
unveiling
ceremony
defence
minister
amir
hatami
said
this
cruise
missile
needs
a
very
short
time
for
its
preparedness
and
can
fly
at
a
low
the
missile
named
hoveizeh
is
from
the
soumar
family
of
cruise
missiles
which
iran
added
to
its
arsenal
in
hatami
said
western
experts
say
iran
often
exaggerates
its
weapons
capabilities
although
there
are
concerns
about
its
ballistic
missiles
amirali
hajizadeh
head
of
the
revolutionary
guard
aerospace
division
said
iran
had
overcome
initial
problems
in
producing
jet
engines
for
cruise
missiles
and
could
now
manufacture
a
full
range
of
the
weapons
the
defence
ministry
s
website
carried
an
undated
video
purportedly
showing
the
hoveizeh
being
from
a
mobile
launcher
it
quoted
hatami
as
saying
the
missile
had
successfully
hit
targets
at
a
distance
of
km
since
agreeing
to
a
nuclear
deal
with
world
powers
iran
has
expanded
its
missile
programme
despite
warnings
from
the
united
states
in
january
it
tried
to
launch
a
satellite
into
space
which
it
said
failed
the
launch
followed
a
warning
to
iran
against
undertaking
three
planned
rocket
launches
that
washington
said
would
violate
a
united
nations
security
council
resolution
the
resolution
which
enshrined
iran
s
nuclear
deal
called
upon
tehran
to
refrain
for
up
to
eight
years
from
work
on
ballistic
missiles
designed
to
deliver
nuclear
weapons
iran
says
its
missile
tests
are
not
in
violation
of
the
resolution
and
denies
its
missiles
are
capable
of
carrying
nuclear
warheads
brigadier
general
hossein
salami
deputy
head
of
the
elite
revolutionary
guard
reiterated
iran
s
rejection
of
any
talks
on
its
missile
programme
in
response
to
a
demand
raised
by
france
and
other
european
countries
the
news
agency
fars
reported
france
said
last
month
it
was
ready
to
impose
further
sanctions
on
iran
if
no
progress
was
made
in
talks
about
the
missiles
described
by
tehran
as
defensive
but
seen
in
the
west
as
a
destabilising
factor
in
a
volatile
region
salami
said
iran
s
decision
to
limit
the
range
and
the
number
of
its
ballistic
missiles
was
based
on
its
current
strategy
which
could
change
based
on
circumstances
if
today
the
europeans
or
others
try
to
plot
and
pursue
iran
s
missile
disarmament
then
we
will
be
forced
to
resort
to
a
strategic
leap
fars
cited
salami
as
saying
an
apparent
threat
that
iran
may
seek
to
boost
the
range
or
the
number
of
the
missiles
last
week
iran
dismissed
the
pressure
from
france
for
talks
but
said
it
had
no
plans
to
increase
the
range
of
the
weapons
president
donald
trump
quit
the
iran
nuclear
deal
last
year
and
reimposed
sanctions
on
tehran
that
had
been
lifted
under
the
pact
in
return
for
tehran
curbing
its
nuclear
programme
washington
says
although
iran
has
met
the
terms
the
accord
was
too
generous
failing
to
rein
in
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
or
curb
what
the
united
states
says
is
interference
in
regional
affairs
iran
has
developed
a
large
domestic
arms
industry
in
the
face
of
international
sanctions
and
embargoes
that
have
barred
it
from
importing
most
weapons
