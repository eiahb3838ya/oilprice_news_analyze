black
sea
oil
gas
received
a
construction
permit
from
the
country
s
energy
ministry
on
friday
for
an
offshore
gas
project
but
it
said
new
taxes
could
make
it
hard
to
go
ahead
with
the
development
the
company
controlled
by
private
equity
firm
carlyle
group
lp
discovered
two
wells
holding
an
estimated
billion
cubic
metres
of
gas
in
some
kilometres
offshore
in
the
black
sea
it
hoped
to
start
production
by
pending
a
final
investment
decision
becoming
the
first
in
a
line
of
companies
to
tap
the
european
union
state
s
vast
offshore
resources
but
romania
s
social
democrat
government
approved
a
slew
of
taxes
via
emergency
decree
in
december
without
an
impact
assessment
or
public
debate
including
a
tax
on
turnover
for
energy
firms
and
a
cap
on
gas
prices
that
came
on
top
of
other
new
laws
for
offshore
drilling
stipulating
that
romanian
companies
would
need
to
sell
at
least
half
their
yearly
gas
output
in
the
country
the
impact
of
these
legislative
changes
on
our
investment
plans
are
highly
negative
the
firm
s
chief
executive
mark
beacom
told
reuters
our
ability
to
obtain
a
final
investment
decision
is
adversely
unlike
other
countries
in
the
region
romania
is
largely
independent
in
terms
of
its
energy
needs
it
imports
less
than
percent
of
its
gas
needs
from
russia
with
the
rest
produced
locally
mainly
by
state
producer
romgaz
and
omv
petrom
controlled
by
austria
s
omv
the
price
cap
removes
investor
confidence
that
being
a
romanian
producer
will
not
result
in
being
economically
disadvantaged
versus
investing
in
other
countries
beacom
added
the
sales
restrictions
also
made
it
difficult
for
the
company
to
finance
the
offshore
project
he
said
the
new
taxes
and
price
caps
have
received
widespread
criticism
from
businesses
but
the
government
has
said
it
has
no
plans
to
withdraw
or
amend
the
emergency
decree
in
october
after
the
offshore
law
was
approved
petrom
postponed
an
investment
decision
on
its
black
sea
neptun
block
a
joint
venture
with
major
exxonmobil
last
year
the
national
agency
for
mineral
resources
anrm
said
the
country
could
almost
double
its
natural
gas
production
to
about
billion
cubic
metres
a
year
by
helped
by
new
black
