brussels
reuters
the
european
union
will
end
restrictions
on
the
sale
of
solar
panels
from
china
early
next
week
in
a
move
that
eu
producers
said
would
lead
to
a
flood
of
cheap
imports
the
european
commission
which
coordinates
eu
trade
policy
said
in
a
statement
on
friday
that
the
measures
would
expire
at
midnight
on
monday
confirming
a
reuters
report
on
the
eu
first
imposed
and
measures
for
chinese
solar
panels
wafers
and
cells
in
and
extended
them
by
months
in
march
last
year
signaling
that
they
should
then
end
chinese
manufacturers
have
been
allowed
to
sell
solar
products
in
europe
free
of
duties
if
they
do
so
at
or
above
a
progressively
declining
minimum
price
if
sold
for
less
than
that
price
they
are
subject
to
duties
of
up
to
percent
the
commission
said
it
was
in
the
best
interests
of
the
eu
as
a
whole
for
the
measures
to
lapse
given
the
bloc
s
aim
of
increasing
its
supply
of
renewable
energy
the
measures
had
also
decreased
over
time
allowing
import
prices
to
align
with
world
market
prices
it
said
china
s
commerce
ministry
welcomed
the
end
of
restrictions
describing
the
move
as
a
model
for
successfully
resolving
trade
frictions
through
the
move
will
restore
trade
of
photovoltaics
to
a
normal
market
condition
will
provide
a
more
stable
and
predictable
business
environment
for
cooperation
between
the
two
sides
industries
and
will
truly
realize
mutual
benefit
for
both
sides
the
ministry
said
in
a
statement
on
its
website
solarpower
europe
which
represents
importers
and
installers
described
the
move
as
a
watershed
moment
for
europe
s
solar
industry
and
that
it
removes
the
biggest
barrier
to
growth
of
the
sector
the
european
union
has
faced
a
delicate
balancing
act
between
the
interests
of
eu
manufacturers
and
those
such
as
importers
and
installers
pressing
for
a
reduction
in
the
cost
of
solar
power
generation
it
has
also
been
concerned
about
the
response
from
beijing
given
that
the
two
sides
were
on
the
verge
of
a
trade
war
over
the
issue
in
eu
prosun
the
grouping
of
eu
producers
that
launched
the
initial
complaint
in
and
wanted
a
further
extension
of
measures
had
said
that
european
manufacturers
would
be
devastated
if
the
measures
ended
beijing
s
decision
to
limit
installations
in
china
meant
producers
there
had
some
gigawatts
of
excess
capacity
to
shift
but
with
few
markets
to
sell
into
after
tariffs
imposed
by
the
united
states
and
planned
by
india
the
second
and
markets
behind
china
the
total
eu
market
is
about
gigawatts
some
companies
were
considering
a
legal
challenge
at
the
european
court
of
justice
eu
prosun
said
adding
that
years
of
falling
prices
had
not
resulted
in
growth
of
the
european
market
