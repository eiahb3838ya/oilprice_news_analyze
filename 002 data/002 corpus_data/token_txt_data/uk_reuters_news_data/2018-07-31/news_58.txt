july
reuters
bond
prices
gained
on
tuesday
while
the
dollar
pared
early
losses
on
the
yen
amid
guarded
reaction
to
what
was
seen
as
only
minor
tweaks
to
the
bank
of
japan
s
boj
ultra
easy
monetary
policy
following
its
board
meeting
the
boj
pledged
to
keep
interest
rates
very
low
for
the
time
being
it
also
took
measures
to
make
its
massive
stimulus
programme
more
flexible
reflecting
its
forecast
that
it
would
take
time
for
inflation
to
hit
its
percent
target
the
announcement
provided
some
comfort
to
bond
investors
as
the
policy
tweaks
didn
t
appear
to
show
any
inclination
from
the
boj
to
make
a
radical
shift
from
its
accommodative
stance
in
response
yields
on
japanese
government
bonds
jgbs
fell
basis
points
to
pull
away
from
a
year
high
of
percent
while
those
on
bonds
slid
nearly
basis
points
the
move
in
jgbs
pushed
treasury
yields
lower
too
however
the
reaction
in
currencies
was
muted
as
some
market
participants
awaited
further
clarity
the
dollar
pared
losses
against
the
yen
and
was
last
flat
at
the
dollar
index
which
measures
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
was
barely
changed
at
the
market
is
definitely
cautious
at
this
point
hopefully
we
ll
get
some
more
clarity
when
kuroda
speaks
later
today
said
rodrigo
catril
senior
forex
analyst
at
national
australia
bank
boj
governor
haruhiko
kuroda
will
hold
a
news
conference
at
gmt
to
explain
the
policy
decision
at
this
point
it
s
very
unclear
what
the
boj
means
by
allowing
rates
to
go
up
and
down
that
is
as
vague
as
it
can
be
catril
added
the
proof
will
be
in
how
they
react
in
the
open
market
operations
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
they
allow
jgb
rates
to
increase
that
will
set
a
tone
for
the
elsewhere
asian
share
markets
pared
some
of
their
early
losses
as
easy
monetary
policy
is
seen
as
positive
for
risk
assets
although
a
global
rout
in
technology
shares
put
a
lid
on
gains
japan
s
nikkei
was
last
down
percent
after
falling
more
than
percent
earlier
in
the
day
south
korea
s
kospi
index
dipped
percent
despite
solid
results
from
samsung
electronics
which
posted
a
percent
rise
in
profit
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
was
also
down
percent
while
australian
shares
were
mostly
overnight
in
wall
street
the
dow
and
the
s
p
each
lost
percent
and
the
nasdaq
skidded
percent
largely
led
by
losses
in
tech
stocks
the
technology
index
crumbled
percent
as
disappointing
results
from
facebook
twitter
and
netflix
spurred
concerns
about
future
growth
for
a
sector
that
has
led
equities
to
record
highs
investors
will
next
turn
their
attention
to
other
central
bank
decisions
this
week
the
federal
reserve
concludes
its
policy
meeting
on
wednesday
and
the

of
england
is

also
due
from
china
on
wednesday
the
british
pound
held
at
drifting
away
from
a
more
than
trough

after
a
sharp
rally
overnight
while
