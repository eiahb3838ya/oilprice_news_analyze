a

showed
that

are
likely
to
hold
fairly
steady
this

next
as

to
offset

disruptions
opec

iran
the

s
no

looming
sanctions
have
already
started

iran
said
president

was
mistaken
to
expect
saudi

other
oil
producers
to
compensate
for
supply
losses
caused
by
sanctions

largely
overlooked

defuse
the

end
to
the
ongoing
