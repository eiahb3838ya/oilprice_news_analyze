reuters
a
steep
global
decline
in
the
price
of
solar
modules
in
recent
weeks
is
nearly
offsetting
the
effect
of
the
trump
administration
s
percent
tariff
on
imported
panels
the
chief
executive
of
a
major
solar
company
said
on
monday
while
the
price
drop
is
trimming
the
profit
margins
of
manufacturers
it
is
welcome
news
for
purchasers
of
solar
systems
who
had
been
facing
higher
prices
since
the
tariffs
went
into
effect
in
february
if
you
are
building
a
large
power
plant
your
pricing
has
certainly
come
back
at
least
halfway
to
what
it
was
if
not
all
the
way
tom
werner
the
ceo
of
sunpower
corp
said
in
an
interview
following
the
company
s
financial
results
announcement
it
s
muting
the
impact
of
solar
module
prices
are
down
about
percent
globally
since
china
announced
changes
to
its
incentives
for
solar
power
on
june
that
have
led
to
an
oversupply
of
panels
that
had
been
intended
for
installation
in
china
the
world
s
largest
solar
market
sunpower
is
both
a
manufacturer
of
solar
panels
and
an
installer
of
solar
power
systems
the
san
jose
company
makes
its
products
primarily
in
the
philippines
and
mexico
and
is
seeking
an
exclusion
from
the
tariffs
sunpower
makes
panels
and
werner
told
analysts
on
a
conference
call
that
the
company
was
responding
to
the
price
declines
and
would
not
allow
its
premium
to
expand
the
company
is
in
the
process
of
buying
rival
solarworld
americas
expanding
its
domestic
manufacturing
in
oregon
to
stem
the
impact
of
the
tariffs
the
price
decline
makes
domestic
manufacturing
that
much
more
challenging
werner

sunpower
was
committed
to
closing
its
deal
to
acquire
solarworld

to
compete
he
said
sunpower
expects
to
spend
million
on
tariffs

second
half
of
this
year
an
amount
the
company
would
prefer
to
invest
in
its
technology
and
scaling
up
its
manufacturing
werner
said
on
a
conference
call
with
analysts
sunpower
reported
a
loss
and
revenue
that
topped
estimates
due
to
strength
in
its
rooftop
solar
business
and
cost
controls
the
company
also
said
it
would
begin
manufacturing
its
technology
later
this
year
