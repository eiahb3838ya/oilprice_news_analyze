adopting
some
of
the
most
stringent
measures
needed
to
curb
climate
change
across
all
industries
could
cause
hunger
levels
to
rise
by
three
times
as
much
as
global
warming
itself
according
to
a
study
released
on
tuesday
including
agriculture
in
schemes
such
as
a
global
carbon
tax
could
put
million
more
people
at
risk
of
hunger
by
by
pushing
up
the
price
of
food
said
the
researchers
whose
paper
was
published
in
nature
climate
change
that
compares
with
an
estimated
million
from
climate
change
alone
they
said
globally
million
people
are
already
going
hungry
according
to
the
united
nations
food
and
agriculture
organization
fao
it
will
become
difficult
for
the
poor
and
vulnerable
people
to
buy
enough
food
said
tomoko
hasegawa
one
of
the
lead
researchers
of
the
paper
which
recommends
countries
instead
adopt
specific
policies
for
agriculture
some
people
may
also
shift
from
products
to
less
nutritious
agriculture
forestry
and
other
land
uses
together
account
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
the
world
s
greenhouse
gas
emissions
according
the
fao
but
introducing
carbon
taxes
expanding
biofuel
plantations
and
planting
trees
all
measures
that
would
help
countries
meet
their
commitments
under
the
paris
climate
agreement
would
increase
the
cost
of
food
production
the
paper
said
by
stringent
climate
mitigation
policy
if
implemented
evenly
across
all
sectors
and
regions
would
have
a
greater
negative
impact
on
global
hunger
and
food
consumption
than
the
direct
impacts
of
climate
change
it
said
the
negative
impacts
would
be
most
prevalent
in
vulnerable
regions
such
as
africa
and
south
asia
where
food
security
problems
are
already
the
findings
underscore
the
challenges
of
cutting
emissions
produced
through
agriculture
which
experts
say
is
essential
to
cap
the
rise
in
global
temperatures
at
a
manageable
level
as
agreed
under
the
paris
deal
hasegawa
a
scientist
with
japan
s
national
institute
for
environmental
studies
said
the
researchers
were
not
trying
to
downplay
the
need
for
mitigation
but
rather
wanted
policymakers
to
be
flexible
in
designing
policies
alternatives
to
carbon
taxes
levies
on
emissions
include
transferring
technologies
that
improve
crop
yields
from
developed
nations
to
help
vulnerable
countries
farm
more
efficiently
she
said
taxing
red
meat
and
dairy
products
and
making
farming
livestock
in
developing
countries
more
efficient
could
also
cut
both
emissions
and
improve
nutrition
the
paper
said
scientists
around
the
world
are
already
working
on
making
livestock
less
gassy
to
fight
global
warming
france
britain
japan
and
parts
of
canada
have
introduced
carbon
taxes
while
large
agricultural
producers
including
the
united
states
and
brazil
have
initiated
policies
to
support
biofuels
