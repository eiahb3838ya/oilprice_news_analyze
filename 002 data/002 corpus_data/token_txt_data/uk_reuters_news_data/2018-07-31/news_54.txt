oil
prices
are
likely
to
hold
fairly
steady
this
year
and
next
as
increased
output
from
opec
and
the
meets
growing
demand
led
by
asia
and
helps
to
offset
supply
disruptions
from
iran
and
elsewhere
a
reuters
poll
showed
on
tuesday
a
survey
of
economists
and
analysts
forecast
brent
crude
to
average
a
barrel
in
cents
higher
than
the
projected
in
the
previous
month
s
poll
and
above
the
average
so
far
this
year
crude
futures
were
seen
averaging
a
barrel
in
compared
with
forecast
last
month
and
an
average
of
until
now
this
is
the
consecutive
month
in
which
analysts
have
raised
their
oil
price
forecasts
we
expect
prices
will
largely
remain
in
the
second
half
of
and
on
the
one
hand
robust
shale
production
and
market
concerns
over
the
brewing
trade
war
will
help
keep
a
lid
on
prices
said
cailin
birch
an
analyst
at
the
economist
intelligence
unit
on
the
other
hand
the
recent
decline
in
global
stocks
will
make
prices
more
sensitive
to
any
geopolitical
risk
which
will
keep
prices
from
falling
significantly
below
current
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
countries
agreed
to
raise
supply
in
a
meeting
last
month
to
meet
rising
global
demand
but
the
group
did
not
specify
a
clear
target
for
the
output
increase
meanwhile
sanctions
on
iran
that
will
come
into
force
later
this
year
will
force
a
decline
in
exports
and
help
support
prices
analysts
said
the
disruption
to
iranian
barrels
will
weigh
on
oil
markets
in
the
second
half
of
and
as
there
are
few
spare
barrels
in
the
market
that
can
offset
a
big
disruption
to
iranian
supplies
said
emirates
nbd
commodities
analyst
edward
bell
the
united
states
pulled
out
of
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
in
early
may
casting
uncertainty
over
global
oil
supplies
and
since
then
it
has
been
preparing
to
work
with
countries
to
help
them
to
cut
iran
oil
imports
analysts
expect
a
drop
of
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
iranian
output
due
to
the
sanctions
but
they
also
said
the
ongoing
global
trade
tensions
could
hurt
demand
a
trade
war
will
slow
down
economic
growth
and
demand
for
oil
but
also
eventually
spill
over
into
other
asset
classes
mostly
equities
that
can
have
an
impact
on
oil
prices
through
a
negative
market
sentiment
jette

management
ltd
said
analysts
continued
to
see
asia
as
the
main
demand
driver
projecting
an
additional
bpd
in
demand
this
year
and
the
next
from
the
region
the
market
is
facing
different
questions
is
global
demand
slowing
due
to
weakening
worldwide
economic
growth
will
production
keep
up
its
incredible
pace
will
output
in
venezuela
keep
plummeting
what
will
sanctions
do
to
iranian
production
and
is
opec
really
willing
to
raise
output
up
to
mbpd
