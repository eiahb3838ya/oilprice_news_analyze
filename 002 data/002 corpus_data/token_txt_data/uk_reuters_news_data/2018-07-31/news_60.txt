the
province
of
liaoning
in
china
s
rustbelt
northeast
has
established
a
parliamentary
committee
to
scrutinize
government
spending
and
control
debt
the
first
province
to
do
so
local
media
reported
the
beijing
news
said
the
new
body
set
up
by
the
standing

of
the
liaoning

push
to
tackle
rising
debt
earlier
this
month
the

said
total

stood
at
around
billion
yuan

the
end

year
billion
yuan
higher
than
the
figure
given
by
the
provincial
government
in
february
the
beijing
news
said
on
monday
according
to
a
notice
issued
by
the
liaoning
people
s
congress
last
week
the
province
s
performance
when
it
comes
to
controlling
expenditure
has
not
been
satisfactory
and
some
old
industrial
regions
have
relied
too
much
on
high
debt
to
drive
growth
it
said
the
new
body
would
bring
spending
budgets
at
all
levels
under
greater
scrutiny
and
control
the
official
china
daily
said
in
an
editorial
on
tuesday
that
the
move
would
set
a
good
example
for
other
regions
when
it
comes
to
tackling
debt
liaoning
province
which
has
long
depended
on
heavy
industries
like
steel
coal
and
machinery
manufacturing
has
sought
to
spend
its
way
out
of
a
economic
decline
investing
huge
amounts
of
public
money
on
new
infrastructure
as
part
of
the
state
s
rejuvenate
the
northeast
program
but
it
continues
to
struggle
to
overcome
slowing
growth
as
well
as
a
rapidly
ageing
population
after
reporting
negative
economic
growth
in
liaoning
began
to
recover
last
year
and
its
gdp
rose
percent
in
the
first
half
of
though
it
still
lagged
the
national
rate
