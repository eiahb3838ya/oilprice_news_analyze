reassurance
by
the
bank
of
japan
that
it
will
keep
its
monetary
policies
in
place
for
an
extended
period
pushed
the
yen
and
global
bond
yields
lower
on
tuesday
though
mounting
concerns
about
the
tech
sector
kept
world
stocks
under
pressure
a
recent
reuters
report
that
the
boj
could
be
debating
scaling
back
its
massive
stimulus
programme
had
sent
japanese
bond
yields
to
year
highs
spilling
into
euro
zone
and
debt
markets
that
helped
push
the
yen
more
than
percent
off
lows
hit
against
the
dollar
in
early
july
but
while
the
boj
announced
some
tweaks
to
its
equity
purchase
programme
and
said
its
stimulus
plan
would
be
more
flexible
the
changes
did
not
show
any
inclination
for
radical
shifts
from
its
accommodative
stance
in
response
yields
on
japanese
government
bonds
fell
basis
points
and
yields
slid
nearly
basis
points
pushing
and
german
yields
down
around
bps
the
boj
is
important
in
the
sense
of
what
they
didn
t
do
said
andrew
milligan
head
of
global
strategy
at
aberdeen
standard
investments
in
edinburgh
it
was
disappointing
for
some
investors
who
thought
they
would
be
more
hawkish
in
their
approach
and
the
market
reaction
with
lower
yen
and
bond
yields
shows
that
view
which
many
people
held
is
euro
zone
yields
later
inched
up
to
trade
around
flat
after
data
showed
inflation
above
forecast
though
this
was
driven
by
higher
energy
costs
separate
data
revealed
the
bloc
s
economic
growth
had
been
slower
than
expected
in
the
second
quarter
of
the
yen
fell
percent
to
trade
around
yen
per
dollar
many
analysts
now
see
it
easing
to
around
especially
if
the
federal
reserve
delivers
a
hawkish
interest
rate
message
when
its
policy
meeting
ends
on
wednesday
the
dollar
was
flat
against
a
basket
of
currencies
but
looks
likely
to
snap
a
streak
of
gains
as
markets
have
more
or
less
priced
in
two
more
fed
rate
hikes
this
year
the
greenback
had
rallied
more
than
percent
in
the
second
quarter
the
boj
s
dovish
pledge
failed
to
offer
a
boost
to
equities
however
markets
have
been
roiled
by
growing
concerns
about
the
global
tech
sector
which
had
seemed
relatively
immune
to
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
europe
and
china
lacklustre
earnings
from
netflix
and
facebook
have
triggered
losses
across
the
tech
sector
with
wall
street
s
tech
index
shedding
percent
in
the
past
three
sessions
that
pushed
world
stocks
to
lows
and
even
japan
s
nikkei
failed
to
hold
on
to
earlier
gains
msci
s
index
of
tech
shares
fell
almost
one
percent
european
tech
followed
suit
losing
percent
and
lagging
broader
equities
that
were
flat
on
the
day
wall
street
was
set
for
a
modestly
firmer
open
futures
signalled
as
investors
await
second
quarter
earnings
from
the
biggest
company
iphone
maker
apple
but
the
tech
retreat
has
overshadowed
an
otherwise
buoyant
earnings
season
with
average
percent
profit
growth
and
percent
of
companies
beating
consensus
estimates
so
far
milligan
attributed
the
setback
to
a
of
share
prices
and
summer
rather
than
a
fundamental
loss
of
confidence
in
the
sector
world
stocks
are
still
set
to
end
july
with
the
best
monthly
returns
since
january
he
noted
the
market
is
saying
you
are
fairly
valued
around
these
prices
so
let
s
wait
for
the
next
big
story
that
will
either
be
on
the
downside
with
trade
tensions
in
autumn
or
it
could
positive
if
chinese
stimulus
turns
out
to
be
greater
than
expected
milligan
added
he
was
referring
to
beijing
s
announcements
offering
more
fiscal
stimulus
to
counter
the
effect
of
trade
tariffs
and
incentives
for
banks
to
lend
to
small
business
markets
now
await
wednesday
s
fed
policy
statement
to
see
if
the
expected
two
rate
hikes
for
the
remainder
of
can
be
cemented
in
in
britain
a
hike
is
now
widely
expected
on
thursday
despite
economic
weakness
linked
to
britain
s
looming
european
union
exit
the
british
pound
has
already
priced
the
move
david
riley
chief
investment
strategist
at
bluebay
asset
management
said
adding
i
think
they
will
do
it
but
it
will
be
one
and
the
pound
firmed
percent
to
around
having
drifted
off
troughs
of
touched
earlier
in
july
