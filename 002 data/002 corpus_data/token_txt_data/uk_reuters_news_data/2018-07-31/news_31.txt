has
lost
its

nuclear
project
in
britain
as
toshiba
looks
at
other
alternatives
the
japanese

said
on
tuesday
the
project
in
moorside
northwest
england
was
expected
to
provide
around
percent
of
britain
s

when
built
but
has
faced
setbacks
after
toshiba
s
nuclear
arm
westinghouse
went
bankrupt
last
year
following
the
westinghouse
bankruptcy
nugen
joint
venture

pulled
out

billion
billion
and
billion
leaving
the
japanese
firm
searching
for
new
investors
kepco
was
chosen
as
preferred
bidder
last
year
but
delays
in
concluding
the
deal
have
led
to
a
review
of
operations
at
nugen
and
of
the
roles
of
its
direct
employees
plus
around
contractors
while
kepco
is
no
longer
the
preferred
bidder
toshiba
said
it
remained
in
the
frame
as
a
possible
buyer
toshiba
continues
to
consider
additional
options
including
the
sale
of
its
shares
in
nugen
to
kepco
and
we
are
carefully
monitoring
the
situation
in
consultation
with
stakeholders
including
the
uk
government
a
spokesperson
for
toshiba
said
in
an
email
to
reuters
south
korea
s
energy
ministry
said
toshiba
notified
it
of
the
withdrawal
of
preferred
bidder
status
on
july
so
it
has
opportunities
for
negotiation
with
other
companies
however
toshiba
said
it
understands
that
an
additional
review
is
needed
for
a
new
business
model
and
will
keep
talking
to
kepco
as
a
first
priority
the
ministry
said
in
a
statement
the
ministry
added
that
it
british
government
officials
and
kepco
met
in
london
and
they
agreed
to
carry
out
a
joint
feasibility
study
on
the
project
once
the
study
is
completed
kepco
will
consult
with
the
south
korean
government
over
the
possibility
of
it
taking
part
in
the
project
the
ministry
said
britain
needs
to
invest
in
new
capacity
to
replace
ageing
coal
and
nuclear
reactors
that
are
due
to
close
in
the
but
large
new
plants
have
struggled
to
get
off
the
ground
due
to
high
costs
and
weak
electricity
prices
