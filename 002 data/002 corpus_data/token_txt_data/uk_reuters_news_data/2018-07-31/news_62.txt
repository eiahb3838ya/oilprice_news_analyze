while
the
yen
edged
higher
ahead
of
the
bank
of
japan
s
rate
review
at
which
it
could
flag
a
shift
away

its
massive
monetary
stimulus
japan

percent

the

crumbled
percent
overnight

disappointing

took
another

is
the

japan
s
central
bank
will
likely
consider
taking
steps
to
make
its
massive
stimulus
programme
more
sustainable
such
as
allowing
greater
swings
in
interest
rates
and
widening
its
selection
according
to
we
would
look
to
fade
the
recent
yen
rally
ahead
of
the
boj
analysts
at
nab
said
looking
further
out
a
boj
that
remains
very
accommodative
for
an
extended
period
will
challenge
our
expectations
for
yen
to
appreciate
amid
its
fundamental
cheap
valuation
and
our
expectations
of
a
softer
