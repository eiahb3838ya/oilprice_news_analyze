jakarta
reuters
indonesia
s
president
called
on
tuesday
for
the
immediate
implementation
of
a
plan
to
widen
the
use
of
biodiesel
that
his
economic
ministers
hope
will
cut
the
country
s
fuel
import
bill
by
billions
of
dollars
and
halt
a
decline
in
the
rupiah
currency
joko
widodo
also
sounded
an
alarm
on
the
foreign
exchange
reserves
of
southeast
asia
s
largest
economy
less
than
a
week
after
he
pleaded
with
exporters
to
bring
home
earnings
they
currently
keep
offshore
to
stem
the
slide
in
the
rupiah
the
country
needs
dollars
now
widodo
said
at
the
opening
of
a
cabinet
meeting
before
reporters
were
ushered
out
i
don
t
want
to
keep
doing
meetings
without
good
concerns
about
tighter
monetary
policy
and
a
global
trade
war
have
put
emerging
market
currencies
under
pressure
indonesia
central
bank
has
spent
about
billion
of
its
foreign
exchange
reserves
in
recent
months
and
hiked
policy
interest
rates
by
basis
points
to
defend
the
rupiah
which
has
lost
about
percent
of
its
value
against
the
dollar
this
year
cabinet
ministers
have
met
at
least
six
times
since
the
start
of
july
to
tackle
concerns
over
trade
and
the
rupiah
said
a
senior
government
official
who
asked
not
to
be
named
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
issue
like
any
other
central
bank
in
the
world
bank
indonesia
can
only
slow
things
down
and
smooth
things
out
but
can
not
stop
underlying
trends
driven
by
fundamentals
the
official
said
one
key
remedy
the
government
sees
as
a
way
to
cut
the
current
account
deficit
which
the
central
bank
estimated
would
widen
by
billion
this
year
is
a
plan
to
substitute
fuel
imports
with
palm
biodiesel
by
making
it
mandatory
for
all
diesel
vehicles
including
locomotive
engines
and
heavy
equipment
the
present
rules
intended
to
boost
consumption
of
biodiesel
apply
only
to
subsidized
diesel
which
some
users
and
vehicles
are
not
allowed
to
buy
indonesia
is
the
world
s
top
producer
of
palm
oil
the
raw
ingredient
for
fatty
acid
methyl
ester
fame
which
can
be
used
to
make
biodiesel
vegetable
oil
prices
are
currently
low
in
relation
to
fossil
fuel
prices
which
have
risen
sharply
so
government
planners
see
sense
in
consuming
more
palm
oil
domestically
to
curb
imports
of
diesel
expanding
the
biodiesel
program
could
save
indonesia
billion
in
import
costs
a
year
the
official
said
industry
minister
airlangga
hartarto
told
reporters
this
week
the
saving
could
be
as
much
as
billion
in
the
short
term
this
would
be
a
faster
solution
compared
to
trying
to
boost
exports
said
josua
pardede
an
economist
at
bank
permata
in
jakarta
replacing
imports
would
be
one
alternative
to
maintain
the
current
account
deficit
at
a
healthy
a
presidential
regulation
on
expanding
had
been
completed
and
it
would
start
no
later
than
next
month
said
chief
economic
minister
darmin
nasution
along
with
low
prices
indonesian
palm
oil
exporters
are
already
facing
pressure
europe
due
to
concerns
over
environmental
damage
related
to
deforestation
so
more
domestic
consumption
will
be
welcome
to
plantation
companies
however
while
biodiesel
can
cut
fuel
costs
and
reduce
emissions
some
varieties
need
special
handling
and
equipment
as
the
fuel
has
a
solvent
effect
corroding
engine
seals
and
gasket
materials
and
it
can
solidify
in
the
cold
indonesia
s
auto
industries
group
gaikindo
has
said
stepping
up
biodiesel
blends
can
increase
fuel
consumption
and
could
cause
engines
to
overheat
kyatmaja
lookman
deputy
chairman
of
the
indonesian
trucking
association
said
fuel
consumption
could
increase
by
percent
the
question
is
when
our
drivers
have
to
spend
more
on
fuel
their
welfare
is
also
declining
he
told
reporters
who
will
be
responsible
for
this
percent
increase
the
transportation
business
margin
is
only
