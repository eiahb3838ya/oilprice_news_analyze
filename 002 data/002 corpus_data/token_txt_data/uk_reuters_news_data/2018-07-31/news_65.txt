china's renewable power waste falls, but warns of challenges
shanghai
july

levels
of
wasted
power
in
china
s
renewable
sector
fell
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
but
securing
grid
access
for
many
new
clean
energy
projects
remains
a
challenge
for
the
industry
an
energy
bureau
official
said
china
s
renewable
energy
capacity
has
soared
thanks
to
generous
subsidies
and
ambitious
targets
but
the
country
does
not
have
enough
transmission
capacity
to
deliver
all
the
new
power
to
customers
a
problem
known
as
curtailment
to
resolve
the
issue
the
government
has
been
trying
to
adjust
the
timing
of
construction
and
has
set
up
an
early
warning
system
forcing
regions
suffering
from
excess
capacity
growth
to
slow
down
the
pace
of
new
approvals
from
this
year
the
situation
has
improved
said
liang
zhipeng
of
the
renewable
energy
office
of
the
national
energy
administration
during
a
media
briefing
on
monday
but
absorbing
renewable
power
remains
a
long
term
china
s
total
renewable
energy
capacity
reached
gigawatts
by
the
end
of
june
up
percent
on
the
year
accounting
for
nearly
of
total
energy
capacity
fuel
power
renewables
and
nuclear
accounted
for
percent
of
china
s
new
installed
energy
capacity
in
the
first
half
up
percentage
points
compared
to
a
year
earlier
wind
curtailment
rates
stood
at
percent
down
percentage
points
on
the
year
while
solar
curtailment
also
fell
percentage
points
to
percent
during
the
first
half
liang
said
new
demand
had
created
more
favourable
conditions
for
the
renewable
sector
but
it
still
faced
big
challenges
over
the
long
term
it
is
very
important
to
establish
an
effective
mechanism
to
absorb
and
utilise
renewable
energy
he
said
amid
overcapacity
fears
china
has
already
taken
action
to
restrict
the
number
of
new
solar
power
generation
projects
this
year
after
record
growth
in
the
state
planning
agency
said
at
the
end
of
june
that
it
would
cap
new
capacity
at
gw
in
compared
to
gw
last
year
