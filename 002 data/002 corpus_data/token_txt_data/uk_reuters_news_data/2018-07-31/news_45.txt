nearly
a
year
after
hurricane
irma
knocked
out
power
across
the
british
virgin
islands
electricity
boss
leroy
abraham
will
be
among
the
last
residents
to
have
their
homes
reconnected
but
abraham
general
manager
of
the
british
overseas
territory
s
electricity
corporation
bviec
has
barely
had
time
to
notice
his
own
domestic
outage
i
was
far
too
exhausted
from
giving
everybody
else
electricity
said
the
gazing
at
his
house
which
was
wrecked
by
the
ferocious
storm
that
tore
across
the
caribbean
archipelago
last
september
abraham
and
other
officials
are
working
to
avoid
a
repeat
of
the
ordeal
one
avenue
they
are
pursuing
is
to
diversify
sources
of
electricity
by
adding
renewables
to
the
energy
mix
the
british
virgin
islands
bvi
were
plunged
into
darkness
for
six
months
when
irma
packing
winds
of
miles
per
hour
kph
uprooted
electricity
poles
and
left
miles
km
of
cable
littering
streets
and
hillsides
like
many
small
islands
the
territory
has
long
relied
on
costly
imported
fossil
fuels
to
generate
electric
power
but
to
better
withstand
future
disasters
it
is
now
moving
toward
solar
and
geothermal
alternatives
like
many
others
in
the
region
from
montserrat
to
lucia
a
series
of
solar
energy
projects
is
due
to
kick
off
soon
said
mark
vanterpool
bvi
minister
for
communications
and
works
it
s
in
our
interest
to
work
very
hard
at
getting
as
much
as
possible
renewable
energy
produced
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
if
there
is
a
silver
lining
to
the
trauma
of
a
blanket
power
outage
amid
a
humanitarian
crisis
it
is
the
growing
urgency
of
bolstering
the
electricity
grid
with
renewable
energy
officials
and
observers
say
before
the
hurricane
there
was
interest
in
green
power
but
people
were
moving
in
different
directions
said
kaitlyn
bunker
of
the
rocky
mountain
institute
a
helping
the
bvi
with
its
renewable
energy
transition
the
experience
of
the
hurricane
has
catalysed
plans
she
added
on
the
main
island
of
tortola
a
privately
funded
solar
project
led
by
local
firm
caribbean
alternative
energy
is
close
to
being
agreed
bviec
s
abraham
said
the
state
utility
meanwhile
aims
to
set
up
a
hybrid
solar
wind
and
energy
storage
system
on
anegada
a
remote
northern
island
once
an
agreement
to
lease
crown
land
is
signed
the
deal
four
years
in
the
pipeline
only
made
headway
after
irma
abraham
noted
plans
are
also
being
developed
to
fit
solar
panels
on
and
school
roofs
on
tortola
and
virgin
gorda
the
bvi
s
island
key
to
the
islands
clean
energy
future
are
new
regulations
now
awaiting
final
approval
allowing
residents
to
be
paid
for
surplus
renewable
power
they
feed
into
the
grid
the
move
should
encourage
home
and
business
owners
to
install
solar
photovoltaic
panels
on
their
properties
and
could
increase
the
islands
resilience
to
disasters
said
abraham
we
can
t
put
all
our
eggs
in
one
basket
he
said
studies
show
that
when
solar
panels
are
and
installed
they
can
withstand
winds

louis
gritzo

global
a
insurer
that
simulates
natural
hazards
to

materials
at
green
vi
a
bvi
that
has
long
advocated
for
a
law
enabling
the
renewable
energy
sector
executive
director
charlotte
mcdevitt
said
the
regulatory
development
was
huge
we
need
options
because
these
storms
are
going
to
come
again
she
said
noting
that
some
islanders
who
had
solar
panels
got
them
working
again
soon
after
irma
three
years
ago
the
law
did
not
permit
residents
to
produce
most
of
their
own
power
including
from
renewables
such
as
solar
in
areas
covered
by
the
utility
said
mcdevitt
now
bviec
has
received
a
proposal
from
its
main
fuel
provider
kitts
and
nevis
delta
petroleum
to
set
up
a
small
solar
project
next
to
its
diesel
storage
facility
said
abraham
although
we
are
a
fossil
fuel
company
we
decided
to
diversify
out
of
our
portfolio
into
solar
said
bevis
sylvester
delta
s
general
manager
for
the
caribbean
despite
the
new
enthusiasm
for
clean
energy
not
all
experts
are
convinced
the
bvi
can
deliver
on
a
promise
made
five
years
ago
that
by
it
would
meet
a
third
of
its
total
energy
needs
of
about
megawatts
with
renewables
we
ve
been
told
for
the
last
decade
that
renewable
energy
would
go
ahead
but
it
has
not
yet
gone
ahead
said
dana
miller
the
owner
of
atec
a
clean
energy
company
david
crane
former
ceo
of
nrg
energy
travelled
to
the
bvi
a
handful
of
times
when
his
firm
bid
on
a
solar
project
there
his
was
one
of
four
companies
that
responded
in
to
a
request
for
proposals
by
bviec
to
install
solar
panels
on
public
land
including
the
main
airport
but
the
project
was
derailed
by
discussions
over
possible
expansion
plans
for
the
airport
whose
revamp
is
still
under
negotiation
said
abraham
the
episode
speaks
to
a
problem
facing
small
islands
the
world
over
said
rolando
head
of
interenergy
holdings
a
power
company
that
has
helped
pioneer
renewables
in
the
caribbean
though
the
cost
of
setting
up
solar
farms
has
plummeted
in
the
last
five
years
from
about
per
kilowatt
to
projects
remain
pricier
at
about
per
kilowatt
when
you
build
small
facilities
you
have
to
mobilise
a
lot
of
infrastructure
for
a
small
amount
of
power
leading
to
a
higher
unit
cost
said
speaking
from
his
temporary
office
in
tortola
pier
park
a
tourist
complex
minister
vanterpool
said
the
government
would
push
ahead
overcoming
obstacles
and
skepticism
we
have
to
go
to
renewable
energy
he
said
we
have
to
get
there
i
do
think
that
a
choice
