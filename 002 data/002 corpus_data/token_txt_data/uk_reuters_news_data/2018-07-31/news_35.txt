fifteen
units
are
down
at
nine
south
african
power
stations
taking
over
megawatts
or
percent
of
eskom
s
output
off
the
national
grid
an
internal
document
seen
by
reuters
showed
on
tuesday
eskom
provides
more
than
percent
of
the
power
for
africa
s
most
industrialised
economy
but
the
utility
has
been
hit
by
labour
unrest
over
wage
talks
as
it
tries
to
reverse
a
decade
of
financial
decline
by
cutting
costs
earlier
it
warned
there
was
a
high
risk
of
electricity
cuts
on
tuesday
because
of
unplanned
outages
power
cuts
during
the
ongoing
winter
are
likely
to
cause
hardship
for
millions
the
document
sent
on
tuesday
to
senior
staff
of
the
struggling
utility
shows
that
four
units
are
down
at
the
arnot
station
contradicting
an
earlier
claim
by
eskom
that
only
one
of
the
six
units
there
was
not
functioning
reasons
cited
for
the
outages
at
the
units
in
total
include
an
ongoing
wildcat
strike
and
low
coal
levels
which
union
sources
say
are
related
to
the
industrial
unrest
along
the
coal
belt
east
of
johannesburg
eleven
of
the
units
went
down
on
monday
and
tuesday
underscoring
the
impact
of
the
protests
the
other
four
went
down
months
ago
or
last
year
for
reasons
unrelated
to
the
protests
only
two
of
the
units
both
at
arnot
are
expected
to
come
back
on
line
on
tuesday
according
to
the
document
nine
are
expected
to
start
generating
power
again
this
week
employees
at
the
arnot
station
on
tuesday
were
prevented
from
showing
up
to
work
by
striking
colleagues
according
to
eskom
and
union
sources
the
threat
of
protests
and
outages
had
appeared
to
recede
after
eskom
offered
to
raise
salaries
by
around
percent
annually
over
the
next
three
years
but
trade
unions
want
bonuses
to
be
paid
before
they
agree
a
wage
deal
eskom
was
forced
to
implement
controlled
electricity
outages
in
after
workers
protested
over
wages
previously
eskom
implemented
such
measures
known
locally
as
load
shedding
in
denting
economic
output
last
week
eskom
said
it
was
considering
cutting
staff
and
selling
assets
after
swinging
to
a
million
loss
which
underlined
the
gravity
of
its
financial
position
south
africa
s
new
president
cyril
ramaphosa
replaced
eskom
s
entire
board
and
top
executives
in
january
in
a
bid
to
revive
a
crucial
state
enterprise
