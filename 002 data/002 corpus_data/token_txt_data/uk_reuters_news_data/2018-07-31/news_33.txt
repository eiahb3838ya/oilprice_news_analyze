an
upbeat
second
half
of
the
year
on
strong
demand
for
locally
sourced
sand
helping
its
shares
recover
after
disappointing
quarterly
results
permian
producers
are
increasingly
using
locally
available
sand
for
fracking
to
save
transport
costs
silica
said
it
signed
four
new
local
sand
delivery
contracts
in
the
second

chief
executive
officer
bryan
shinn
said
on
a
conference
call
that
he
expects
percent
of
all
permian
sand
demand
to
be
met
locally
by
the
trend
towards
longer
laterals
and
more
sand
per
well
is
continuing

will
drive
strong
demand
into
and
shinn
said
the

down
as
much
as

on
results
were
up
percent
at
the
shale
revolution
centered
around

permian
basin
has
driven
oil

producers
to
dig
deeper
for

latest
designs
involve
longer
lateral
wells
that
are
kept
open
by
the
use
of
proppants
like
sand
shinn
said
he
does
not
see
oil
and
gas
producers
from
the
oklahoma
arkansas
and
mississippi
basins
buying
frac
sand
from
the
regional
and
sand
producers
yet
the
concern
is
real
as
trucking
rates
continue
to
climb
limiting
the
transportability

shinn
said
silica
will
continue
to
double
its

meet
growing
demand
for
