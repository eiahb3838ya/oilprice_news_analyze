senior
iranian
officials
on
tuesday
rejected
president
donald
trump
s
offer
of
talks
without
preconditions
as
worthless
and
a
humiliation
after
he
acted
to
reimpose
sanctions
on
tehran
following
his
withdrawal
from
a
landmark
nuclear
deal
separately
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
said
trump
s
repudiation
of
the
accord
reached
in
was
illegal
and
iran
would
not
easily
yield
to
washington
s
renewed
campaign
to
strangle
iran
s
vital
oil
exports
in
may
trump
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
the
multilateral
deal
concluded
before
he
took
office
denouncing
it
as
in
iran
s
favour
on
monday
he
declared
that
he
would
be
willing
to
meet
rouhani
without
preconditions
to
discuss
how
to
improve
relations
the
head
of
iran
s
strategic
council
on
foreign
relations
said
on
tuesday
tehran
saw
no
worth
in
trump
s
offer
made
only
a
week
after
he
warned
iran
it
risked
dire
consequences
few
had
ever
suffered
in
history
if
it
made
threats
against
washington
based
on
our
bad
experiences
in
negotiations
with
america
and
based
on
officials
violation
of
their
commitments
it
is
natural
that
we
see
no
value
in
his
proposal
kamal
kharrazi
was
quoted
as
saying
by
the
fars
news
agency
trump
should
first
make
up
for
his
withdrawal
from
the
nuclear
deal
and
show
that
he
respects
his
predecessors
commitments
and
international
law
added
kharrazi
a
former
foreign
minister
the
council
was
set
up
by
iranian
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
to
help
formulate
policies
for
the
islamic
republic
trump
s
move
to
force
iran
into
fresh
negotiations
has
for
now
reunited
iranian
hardliners
who
opposed
the
nuclear
deal
and
moderates
like
rouhani
who
championed
it
to
end
the
islamic
republic
s
economically
crippling
with
western
powers
ali
motahari
the
deputy
speaker
of
iran
s
parliament
who
is
seen
as
part
of
iran
s
moderate
camp
said
that
to
negotiate
with
trump
now
would
be
a
humiliation
if
trump
had
not
withdrawn
from
the
nuclear
deal
and
not
imposed
new
sanctions
on
iran
there
would
be
no
problem
with
negotiations
with
america
he
told
state
news
agency
irna
iran
s
interior
minister
chimed
in
that
tehran
did
not
trust
washington
as
a
negotiating
partner
the
united
states
is
not
trustworthy
how
can
we
trust
this
country
when
it
withdraws
unilaterally
from
the
nuclear
deal
abdolreza
rahmani
fazli
was
quoted
as
saying
by
the
fars
news
agency
a
senior
aide
to
rouhani
said
the
only
way
back
to
talks
was
for
washington
to
return
to
the
nuclear
agreement
respecting
the
iranian
nation
s
rights
reducing
hostilities
and
returning
to
the
nuclear
deal
are
steps
that
can
be
taken
to
pave
the
bumpy
road
of
talks
between
iran
and
america
hamid
aboutalebi
tweeted
on
tuesday
under
the
deal
the
fruit
of
rouhani
s
efforts
to
ease
iran
s
international
isolation
to
help
revive
its
economy
iran
curbed
its
shadowy
nuclear
programme
and
won
relief
from
and
western
sanctions
in
return
trump
condemned
the
deal
in
part
because
it
did
not
cover
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
and
involvement
in
middle
east
conflicts
he
reactivated
sanctions
the
most
measures
against
iran
and
warned
countries
to
stop
importing
iranian
oil
from
or
risk
penalties
the
three
major
european
signatories
to
the
deal
have
been
searching
for
ways
to
salvage
it
but
cautioned
tehran
that
they
may
not
be
able
to
persuade
many
major
investors
not
to
bolt
from
business
with
iran
to
avoid
punishment
rouhani
said
during
a
meeting
with
britain
s
ambassador
on
tuesday
that
after
what
he
called
the
illegal
withdrawal
from
the
nuclear
deal
the
ball
is
in
europe
s
court
now
he
added
the
islamic
republic
has
never
sought
tension
in
the
region
and
does
not
want
any
trouble
in
global
waterways
but
it
will
not
easily
give
up
on
its
rights
to
export
rouhani
and
some
senior
military
commanders
have
said
iran
could
disrupt
oil
shipments
from
gulf
states
through
the
strait
of
hormuz
if
washington
tries
to
choke
off
iranian
oil
exports
reiterating
tehran
s
official
stance
iranian
navy
commander
rear
admiral
hossein
khanzadi
was
quoted
as
saying
by
tasnim
news
agency
on
tuesday
that
the
strait
would
remain
open
if
iran
s
national
interests
are
preserved
iran
s
opec
governor
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
told
reuters
on
tuesday
that
trump
was
mistaken
to
expect
saudi
arabia
and
other
oil
producers
to
compensate
for
losses
of
iranian
oil
caused
by
sanctions
it
seems
president
trump
has
been
taken
hostage
by
saudi
arabia
and
a
few
producers
when
they
claimed
they
can
replace
million
barrels
per
day
of
iranian
exports
encouraging
him
to
take
action
against
iran
ardebili
said
now
they
and
russia
sell
more
oil
and
more
expensively
not
even
from
their
incremental
production
but
their
he
said
oil
prices
which
trump
has
been
pressuring
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
to
bring
down
by
raising
output
will
instead
rise
unless
the
united
states
grants
waivers
to
buyers
of
iranian
crude
iran
s
currency
plumbed
new
depths
on
monday
dropping
past
rials
to
the
dollar
but
trump
s
expressed
willingness
to
negotiate
with
tehran
sparked
a
minor
recovery
on
tuesday
to
rials
on
the
unofficial
market
iranian
eshagh
jahangiri
said
the
government
and
the
central
bank
would
unveil
a
new
economic
plan
by
the
end
of
this
week
to
tackle
the
sanctions
and
the
rial
s
fall
videos
on
social
media
showed
hundreds
of
people
rallying
in
isfahan
in
central
iran
in
protest
at
high
prices
caused
in
part
by
the
rial
s
devaluation
under
heightened
pressure
