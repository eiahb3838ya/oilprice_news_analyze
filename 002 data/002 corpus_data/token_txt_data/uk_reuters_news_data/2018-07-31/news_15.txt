congress
apc
last

lawmakers
in

earlier
this

said
it
no
longer
backed
buhari
the
apc
in
a
statement
queried
saraki
alleging
that
he
facilitated
the
defection
of
some
lawmakers
thereby
violating
the
party
s
constitution
the
ruling
party
asked
him
to
respond
within
hours
or
face
sanctions
the
threat
of
sanctions
could
have
led
the
senate
president
to
defect
analysts
say
adding
that
the
loss
of
influential
figures
and
divisions
in
the
party
peels
support
from
buhari
within
powerful
patronage
networks
and
among
voters
ahead
of
the
election
scheduled
for
february
after
extensive
consultations
i
have
decided
to
take
my
leave
of
the
all
progressives
congress
apc
saraki
said
in
a
statement
today
i
start
as
i
return
to
the
party
where
i
began
my
political
journey
the

democratic
party
pdp
the

home
state
of
kwara
in
central
nigeria
the
country
s
ambassador
to
south

ahmed
ibeto
also
defected
to
the
pdp
after
resigning
his
post
the
pdp
said
the
opposition
pdp
said
on
twitter
saraki
had
dumped
the
failed
and
dysfunctional
apc
the
pdp
was
in
power
from
the
start
of
civilian
rule
in
until
buhari
took
office
in
the
apc
coalition
united
to
unseat
buhari
s
predecessor
goodluck
jonathan
in
but
it
is
now
divided
between
buhari
loyalists
and
those
who
say
they
have
been
targeted
by
him
saraki
s
supporters
said
he
had
for
years
been
targeted
by
the
presidency
he
has
been
dogged
by
accusations
of
misconduct
and
investigations
since
taking
the
post
in
with
the
support
of
opposition
lawmakers
but
has
not
been
convicted
saraki
s
defection
was
expected
said
antony
goldman
of
pm
consulting
saying
that
defections
to
the
apc
helped
buhari
to
defeat
jonathan
the
challenge
now
for
the
opposition
will
be
to
overcome
factional
differences
and
personal
ambitions
and
find
at
this
relatively
late
stage
a
credible
candidate
to
challenge
president
buhari
next
february
he
said
nigeria
s
main
opposition
parties
earlier
in
july
agreed
to
form
an
alliance
to
field
a
joint
candidate
to
contest
the
election
buhari
said
in
april
he
would
seek
another
term
and
he
looks
set
to
receive
party
approval

choose
presidential

emerged
since
its
conference
in
june
when
new
party
leaders
were
elected
and
others
saw
their
hopes
of
party
advancement
dashed
all
but
two
of
the
senators
who
left

apc
last
week
joined
the
opposition
