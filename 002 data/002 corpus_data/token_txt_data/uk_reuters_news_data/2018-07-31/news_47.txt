s
top
sovereign
wealth
fund
is
seeking

billion

as
it
seeks
to
boost
its
firepower
to
help
finance
the
kingdom
s
economic
transformation
plans
according
to
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
the
public
investment
fund
pif
issued
a
request
for
proposals
to
banks
several
weeks
ago
about
raising
money
for
a
syndicated
loan
said
two
of
the
sources
with
a
third
adding
the
deal
is
not
expected
to
close
before
september
a
spokesman
for
pif
declined
to
comment
it
would
be
the
first
commercial
loan
for
pif
which
has
been
charged
with
helping
to
deliver
the
vision
reform
plan
announced
by
the
government
in
an
ambitious
economic
programme
designed
to
free
the
kingdom
from
dependence
on
oil
exports
pif
is
also
investing
billions
of
dollars
in
investments
including
contributing
to
a
fund
with
private
equity
firm
blackstone
and
money
to
softbank
s
vision
fund
proceeds
from
the
loan
would
be
used
for
general
corporate
purposes
two
of
the
sources
said
until
recently
the
principal
sources
of
funding
for
pif
were
capital
injections
and
asset
transfers
from
the
government
in
addition
to
earnings
from
existing
investments
but
as
part
of
pif
s
expanded
role
it
is
seeking
to
fund
more
of
its
expansion
through
loans
and
other
debt
instruments
said
a
source
close
to
the
pif
adding
that
the
sovereign
wealth
fund
expected
to
become
one
of
the
most
prominent
users
of
banking
services
in
the
region
and
was
looking
to
form
a
core
group
of
banks
to
offer
some
of
those
services
the
source
said
the
loan
would
be
of
material
size
without
elaborating
with
the
proceeds
used
for
general
investment
activities
by
the
fund
which
set
a
goal
in
of
increasing
its
asset
portfolio
to
trillion
riyals
billion
by
two
of
the
sources
said
the
loan
was
likely
to
be
between
and
billion
with
another
adding
the
amount
was
expected
to
be
a
minimum
of
billion
although
financing
details
have
not
yet
been
confirmed
banks
anticipate
tight
pricing
as
pif
seeks
to
build
relationships
with
lenders
two
of
the
sources
said
pif
will
also
potentially
receive
tens
of
billions
of
