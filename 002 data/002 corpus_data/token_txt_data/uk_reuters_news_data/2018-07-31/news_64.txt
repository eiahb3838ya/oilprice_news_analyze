keystone
xl
crude
oil
pipeline
project
cleared
a
hurdle
on
monday
as
the
trump
administration
said
in

draft
environmental
assessment
that
an
alternative
route
through

xl

and
biological
resources

would
have
only
minor
impacts
on

native
american
graves
the

public
service
commission
approved
the
pipeline
but
not
transcanada

alternative
route
will
cost

millions

route
the
billion
pipeline
that
would
transport
heavy
crude
from
canada
s
oilsands
in
alberta
to
steele
city
nebraska
has
been
fought
by
environmentalists
and
ranchers
for
more
than
a
decade
canadian
oil
producers
who
face
price
discounts
for
their
crude
due

s
state
department
approved
the

an
environmental
impact

from

environmentalists
said
was
outdated
the
sierra
club
an
environmental
group
said
the
state
department
was
attempting
a
short
cut
to
get
the
project
built
and
a
full
review
is
required
that
considers
changes
in
oil
prices
and
market
forces
keystone
is
a
threat
to
our
land
water
wildlife
communities
and
climate
and
we
will
continue
fighting
in
the
courts
and
in
the
streets
to
ensure
that
it
is
never
built
