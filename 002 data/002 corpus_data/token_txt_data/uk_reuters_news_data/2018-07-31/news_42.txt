two
recent
deals
by
the
world
s
two
biggest
mining
companies
both
looked
positive
for
shareholders
but
also
underscore
the
challenges
facing
major
commodity
producers
bhp
billiton
last
week
agreed
to
sell
its
shale
oil
and
gas
assets
for
billion
while
rio
tinto
appears
on
track
to
exit
its
troubled
investment
in
the
giant
grasberg
copper
and
gold
mine
in
indonesia
for
about
billion
both
deals
were
generally
by
investors
largely
because
they
resolve
sores
for
the
mining
giants
and
will
likely
result
in
a
return
of
the
proceeds
to
shareholders
bhp
chief
executive
andrew
mackenzie
has
said
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
the
shale
assets
will
be
returned
to
shareholders
but
hasn
t
yet
given
details
of
how
and
when
rio
tinto
has
been
cautious
over
the
announced
agreement
to
sell
its
indonesian
unit
to
the
miner
pt
inalum
which
would
effectively
mean
selling
its
percent
interest
in
grasberg
which
is
operated
by
inc
however
the
chances
are
good
that
at
least
some
of
the
proceeds
should
the
deal
be
finalised
will
wind
up
in
the
hands
of
shareholders
while
investors
are
usually
pleased
to
get
their
hands
on
a
pile
of
cash
the
fact
that
bhp
intends
to
hand
over
the
cash
and
rio
tinto
may
do
the
same
illustrates
that
there
really
are
very
few
suitable
investment
opportunities
mining
companies
were
heavily
criticised
for
in
the
last
boom
period
which
ended
in
and
was
followed
by
five
years
of
declining
prices
for
most
major
commodities
such
as
iron
ore
and
coal
this
resulted
in
the
companies
turning
their
focus
to
operational
efficiencies
and
boosting
returns
to
shareholders
a
shift
that
is
still
the
current
mantra
most
often
heard
from
top
mining
executives
but
while
this
was
a
necessary
change
in
mindset
it
is
also
a
strategy
that
s
unlikely
to
work
in
the
long
term
bhp
retains
offshore
crude
oil
assets
in
the
united
states
and
its
interest
in
liquefied
natural
gas
in
australia
but
the
sale
of
the
shale
oil
and
gas
assets
mainly
to
bp
plc
is
an
effective
retreat
from
a
business
that
has
transformed
the
global
energy
landscape
exiting
shale
also
came
at
a
substantial
overall
price
for
bhp
given
the
assets
cost
about
billion
when
purchased
in
and
have
been
written
down
in
value
several
times
since
then
handing
the
money
back
to
shareholders
through
boosted
dividends
or
a
share
buyback
will
provide
investors
with
a
sugar
hit
but
do
little
to
enhance
the
value
of
bhp
bhp
s
biggest
division
is
its
western
australia
iron
ore
and
the
company
remains
heavily
exposed
to
the
fortunes
of
the
chinese
steel
sector
the
buyer
of
of
the
world
s
seaborne
iron
ore
supplies
rio
tinto
is
even
more
exposed
to
iron
ore
with
its
operations
in
western
australia
accounting
for
about
percent
of
its
earnings
both
bhp
and
rio
tinto
have
struggled
to
diversify
away
from
iron
ore
and
both
have
made
costly
and
unsuccessful
acquisitions
in
the
past
years
bhp
s
massive
olympic
dam
copper
gold
and
uranium
mine
in
south
australia
has
had
problems
ramping
up
production
while
similar
issues
have
impacted
rio
tinto
s
oyu
tolgoi
copper
mine
in
mongolia
these
assets
are
good
enough
to
be
worth
investing
time
money
and
effort
to
get
them
working
efficiently
but
the
difficulties
both
companies
have
encountered
show
there
are
probably
no
easy
major
projects
left
in
the
world
this
poses
the
question
what
next
for
bhp
rio
tinto
and
other
major
miners
such
as
anglo
american
and
brazil
s
vale
they
run
the
risk
of
being
companies
that
can
return
cash
to
shareholders
in
the
good
times
but
will
lag
when
commodity
prices
go
through
the
inevitable
cyclical
downturns
while
it
would
be
foolish
to
advocate
the
companies
jumping
headlong
into
new
mining
areas
such
as
battery
metals
like
lithium
and
cobalt
it
s
likely
that
eventually
investors
will
demand
more
from
the
top
resource
companies
