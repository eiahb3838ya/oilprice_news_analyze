reuters
courts
in
curacao
and
bonaire
have
partially
lifted
attachments
introduced
by
conocophillips
aiming
to
seize
venezuelan
pdvsa
s
assets
to
satisfy
a
billion
billion
arbitration
ruling
according
to
a
copy
of
the
documents
seen
by
reuters
conoco
has
aggressively
moved
to
take
over
oil
firm
pdvsa
s
inventories
cargoes
and
facilities
following
an
award
by
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
last
month
the
dispute
has
particularly
affected
the
caribbean
where
pdvsa
owns
and
operates
refineries
and
terminals
that
supply
several
islands
both
the
court
in
curacao
and
those
in
bonaire
have
decided
that
the
attachments
must
be
lifted
to
the
extent
that
this
is
necessary
for
the
fuel
electricity
supply
on
both
islands
the
common
court
of
justice
said
in
a
release
the
proceeds
from
the
fuel
sales
to
local
distributor
curoil
must
be
transferred
to
a
specially
designated
account
where
the
money
will
remain
until
it
is
established
who
will
be
entitled
to
it
the
court
added
we
are
pleased
with
the
result
as
this
is
consistent
with
the
proposal
made
by
conocophillips
to
both
islands
local
authorities
curoil
and
the
local
courts
conoco
said
in
a
statement
pdvsa
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
conoco
s
seizure
requests
froze
pdvsa
s
oil
inventories
in
aruba
curacao
bonaire
and
eustatius
as
well
as
two
oil
cargoes
off
aruba
curacao
s
bpd
isla
refinery
is
currently
operating
but
pdvsa
has
not
sent
crude
to
that
facility
since
last
week
so
it
is
expected
to
halt
operations
in
the
near
future
according
to
pdvsa
sources
the
bonaire
and
curacao
judges
also
ruled
that
pdvsa
must
resume
fuel
deliveries
to
curoil
but
it
is
unclear
how
isla
would
continue
producing
pdvsa
will
be
fined
million
for
each
day
it
does
not
comply
with
the
ruling
with
a
maximum
fine
of
million
the
curacao
judge
said
in
a
statement
conoco
s
legal
actions
have
created
worry
across
the
caribbean
and
central
america
as
bpd
of
fuel
were
expected
to
be
shipped
by
pdvsa
from
curacao
in
may
mainly
to
cuba
belize
nicaragua
el
salvador
and
haiti
according
to
pdvsa
s
internal
trade
reports
curacao
prime
minister
eugene
rhuggenaath
last
week
said
the
dispute
is
posing
a
potential
crisis
for
the
island
aruba
is
preparing
a
contingency
plan
to
avoid
a
situation
similar
to
curacao
and
bonaire
where
inventories
were
blocked
according
to
aruba
s
prime
minister
evelyn
the
state
department
earlier
this
week
said
there
is
enough
oil
in
the
global
market
to
make
up
for
potential
fuel
disruptions
due
to
conoco
s
actions
the
department
of
state
remains
in
contact
with
our
partners
in
the
caribbean
to
reduce
the
risk
of
supply
disruptions
