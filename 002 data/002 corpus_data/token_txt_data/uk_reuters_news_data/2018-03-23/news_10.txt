copenhagen
reuters
boeing
lost
a
lawsuit
against
denmark
on
friday
which
related
to
the
danish
government
s
decision
to
buy
lockheed
martin
s
lightning
ii
combat
jets
in
preference
to
boeing
s
super
hornets
boeing
had
taken
denmark
to
court
over
a
lack
of
access
to
documents
used
in
the
government
s
decision
to
buy
the
lockheed
martin
jets
the
court
has
found
that
the
authorities
decisions
on
refusal
of
access
to
the
documents
are
legal
and
valid
copenhagen
s
city
court
said
in
a
summary
of
the
verdict
on
its
website
on
friday
boeing
said
it
was
disappointed
by
the
decision
and
would
now
review
it
and
consider
how
to
proceed
after
denmark
decided
to
buy
of
lockheed
martin
s
new
warplanes
in
boeing
complained
that
the
evaluation
process
for
the
planes
competing
for
the
order
had
been
flawed
and
demanded
access
to
the
documents
in
the
case
boeing
initiated
this
legal
action
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
evaluation
process
in
which
we
believe
the
ministry
made
a
number
of
critical
errors
and
omissions
in
its
evaluation
boeing
said
in
a
statement
on
friday
denmark
s
defence
ministry
had
denied
boeing
access
because
the
company
had
not
specified
which
documents
it
wanted
to
see
and
that
it
would
too
large
a
task
to
find
all
documents
since
preparations
for
the
order
began
