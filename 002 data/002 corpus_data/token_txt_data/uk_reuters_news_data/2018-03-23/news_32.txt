following
pressure
from

three

under
pressure
from

a
source
with
direct
knowledge
of
the

government
ministries
in
vietnam
had
paused
the
project
while
the
politburo
debates
whether
to
suspend
or
indefinitely
terminate
the
contract
the
decision
which
hangs
on
whether
the
fees
incurred
by
contract
cancellation
will
exceed
the
cost
of
resisting
chinese
pressure
is
on
hold
until
the
politburo
meets
the
source
said
that
meeting
has
been
delayed
by
overseas

s
prime
minister
nguyen
xuan
phuc
a
series
of
visits
by
foreign
dignitaries
to
hanoi
and
the

van
khai
on
saturday
the
ministries
are
determined

said
the
source
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
situation
a
source
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
situation
confirmed
that
the
project
which
is
a
joint
venture
with
state
oil
company
petrovietnam
had
been
stopped
following
pressure
from
china
a
source
at
repsol
told
reuters
executives
had
been
discussing
how
to
respond
to
the
pressure
which
had
been
applied
both
directly
by
china
and
indirectly
via
vietnam
a
spokesman
for
repsol
in
madrid
declined
to
comment
petrovietnam
executives
declined
to
comment
the
vietnamese
foreign
ministry
did
not
immediately
respond
to
an
emailed
request
for
comment
asked
at
a
regular
briefing
if
china
had
pressed
either
vietnam
or
repsol
chinese
foreign
ministry
spokeswoman
hua
chunying
said
she
did
not
know
where
such
news
had
come
from
but
did
not
elaborate
we
hope
the
relevant
sides
can
work
together
to
maintain
the
positive
situation
in
the
south
china
sea
she
said
red
emperor
known
in
vietnamese
as
the
ca
rong
do
field
is
part
of
block
in
the
nam
con
son
basin
km
miles
off
the
coast
of
vietnam
s
southern
city
of
vung
tau
the
field
of
moderate
size
by
international
standards
is
seen
as
a
key
asset
to
help
slow
the
decline
of
vietnam
s
stalling
oil
and
gas
production
but
the
block
lies
near
the
line
that
marks
the
vast
area
that
china
claims
in
the
sea
and
overlaps
what
it
says
are
its
own
oil
concessions
located
in
waters
around
metres
ft
deep
it
is
considered
to
be
profitable
from
around
per
barrel
current
brent
crude
oil
prices
are
almost
per
barrel
the
field
s
estimated
potential
recovery
is
around
million
barrels
of
crude
oil
billion
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas
and
million
barrels
of
condensate
a
super
light
form
of
crude
oil
that
is
mostly
a
byproduct
of
gas
production
global
crude
oil
by
comparison
is
at
almost
million
barrels
per
day
global
gas
consumption
is
around
trillion
cubic
metres
per
year
the
move

for
commercial
drilling
