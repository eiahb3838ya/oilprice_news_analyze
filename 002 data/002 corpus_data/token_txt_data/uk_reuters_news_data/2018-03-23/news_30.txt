chinese
buyers
of
soybeans
the
united
states
biggest
agricultural
export
to
the
country
are
quietly
drawing
up
contingency
plans
to
ensure
supplies
of
critical
raw
materials
in
the
event
of
a
trade
war
sources
said
the
moves
are
the
strongest
sign
yet
that
businesses
in
the
world
s
most
populous
country
are
growing
worried
that
critical
commodities
could
get
caught
up
in
escalating
trade
tensions
at
least
two
trading
houses
have
started
buying
more
rapeseed
meal
an
alternative
ingredient
used
to
make
animal
feed
in
case
the
oilseed
is
a
target
of
retaliation
by
beijing
sources
at
the
company
familiar
with
the
strategies
said
it
is
an
obvious
choice
to
seek
other
protein
sources
we
are
buying
more
rapeseed
meal
for
example
said
one
of
the
sources
as
an
extra
layer
of
protection
his
company
has
also
started
to
include
exit
clauses
in
purchase
contracts
with
suppliers
giving
them
the
right
to
cancel
the
order
if
needed
the
second
source
said
their
firm
was
also
purchasing
more
domestic
distillers
dried
grains
ddgs
a
byproduct
of
ethanol
production
used
as
an
animal
feed
ingredient
the
company
is
also
considering
ramping
up
purchases
of
brazilian
soybeans
the
sources
declined
to
be
named
as
they
are
not
authorised
to
speak
to
the
media
and
would
not
disclose
further
details
due
to
the
commercial
sensitivity
of
the
issue
penalties
on
soybeans
would
be
a
powerful
weapon
in
beijing
s
arsenal
because
they
would
especially
hurt
iowa
a
state
that
backed
president
donald
trump
in
the
presidential
elections
ambassador
to
china
terry
branstad
was
previously
a
governor
of
the
farm
state
the
united
states
shipped
more
than
billion
worth
of
soybeans
to
china
last
year
china
buys
two
thirds
of
the
beans
traded
worldwide
mainly
from
brazil
and
the
united
states
china
s
commerce
and
agriculture
ministries
told
a
delegation
of
soy
growers
last
september
that
soybeans
were
being
considered
as
a
target
for
retaliatory
action
in
the
event
of
trade
action
against
beijing
on
thursday
trump
announced
plans
for
tariffs
on
up
to
billion
in
chinese
goods
for
what
he
says
is
misappropriation
of
intellectual
property
moving
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
closer
to
a
trade
war
china
showed
readiness
to
retaliate
by
declaring
plans
to
levy
additional
duties
on
up
to
billion
of
imports
including
fruit
and
wine
in
response
to
import
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
which
were
due
to
go
into
effect
on
friday
jim
sutter
chief
executive
of
the
soybean
export
council
said
it
would
not
be
a
surprise
for
chinese
crushers
and
importers
to
make
emergency
plans
they
re
business
people
and
they
have
to
be
thinking
about
their
alternatives
he
said
sutter
had
not
heard
of
any
specific
contingency
plans
being
developed
however
chinese
buyers
would
likely
find
it
difficult
to
get
by
only
using
alternatives
because
its
industry
relies
so
heavily
on
soybeans
he
said
even
so
worries
that
china
may
cancel
orders
pushed
cash
bids
for
both
soybeans
and
corn
lower
at
grain
elevators
along
midwest
rivers
on
thursday
indicating
decreased
demand
from
export
terminals
at
the
gulf
a
grains
exporter
said
soybeans
dropped
by
about
cents
to
cents
per
bushel
and
corn
was
down
to
cents
per
bushel
the
threat
of
a
trade
war
drove
up
prices
for
soymeal
hurting
feedmakers
and
pig
farmers
on
friday
the
soymeal
futures
prices
on
the
dalian
commodity
exchange
were
up
percent
at
yuan
per
tonne
traders
and
millers
who
crush
soybeans
and
rapeseed
to
make
meal
and
oil
in
china
say
there
are
no
signs
of
panic
in
the
country
s
vast
farming
and
livestock
sector
any
immediate
impact
on
crushers
will
be
cushioned
by
a
brazilian
crop
coming
to
market
we
will
deal
with
it
if
it
happens
said
ji
feng
a
senior
soybean
trader
at
global
commodities
merchant
cargill
in
a
panel
discussion
at
an
oilseeds
conference
on
thursday
still
the
increasingly
heated
rhetoric
between
the
two
countries
has
given
some
industry
insiders
pause
this
week
i
feel
the
trade
war
is
really
happening
before
it
was
just
talk
but
now
it
seems
real
said
a
purchasing
manager
at
a
feed
company
who
is
bracing
for
a
further
spike
in
soymeal
prices
for
me
the
impact
will
be
mainly
on
soymeal
