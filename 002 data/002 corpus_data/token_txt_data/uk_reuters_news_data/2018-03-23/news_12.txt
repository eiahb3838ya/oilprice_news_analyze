human
activities
are
causing
an
alarming
decline
in
the
variety
of
plant
and
animal
life
on
earth
and
jeopardizing
food
clean
water
and
energy
supplies
a
study
of
biodiversity
said
on
friday
climate
change
will
become
a
steadily
bigger
threat
to
biodiversity
by
adding
to
damage
from
pollution
and
forest
clearance
to
make
way
for
agriculture
according
to
more
than
experts
in
a
set
of
reports
approved
by
governments
biodiversity
the
essential
variety
of
on
earth
continues
to
decline
in
every
region
of
the
world
the
authors
wrote
after
talks
in
colombia
this
alarming
trend
endangers
the
quality
of
life
of
people
four
regional
reports
covered
the
americas
asia
and
the
pacific
africa
europe
and
central
asia
all
areas
of
the
planet
except
the
poles
and
the
high
seas
for
the
americas
the
report
estimated
that
the
value
of
nature
to
people
such
as
crops
wood
water
purification
or
tourism
was
at
least
trillion
a
year
equivalent
to
the
region
s
gross
domestic
product
from
alaska
to
argentina
almost
of
those
natural
contributions
were
in
decline
in
the
americas
it
said
robert
watson
chair
of
the
intergovernmental
platform
on
biodiversity
and
ecosystem
services
ipbes
said
biodiversity
was
not
only
about
saving
rare
butterflies
trees
birds
or
rhinos
while
that
was
important
he
told
reuters
a
key
message
was
please
stop
thinking
of
biodiversity
just
as
an
environmental
issue
it
s
way
more
important
than
that
among
other
economic
estimates
the
africa
report
said
the
absorption
of
greenhouse
gases
by
a
hectare
acres
of
forest
in
central
africa
was
worth
a
year
unless
governments
take
strong
action
to
limit
greenhouse
gas
emissions
climate
change
may
be
the
biggest
threat
to
biodiversity
by
watson
said
he
said
delegates
had
not
challenged
findings
about
climate
change
although
president
donald
trump
doubts
mainstream
scientific
opinion
and
plans
to
pull
out
of
the
paris
climate
agreement
for
pollution
eight
of
rivers
around
the
world
with
most
plastic
waste
were
in
asia
on
current
trends
overfishing
meant
there
could
be
no
exploitable
fish
stocks
in
the
region
by
around
the
world
ever
more
animals
and
plants
were
under
threat
from
human
activities
ranging
from
elephants
in
africa
to
rare
mosses
and
snails
in
europe
the
study
said
by
climate
change
could
result
in
the
loss
of
more
than
half
of
african
bird
and
mammal
species
said
emma
archer
of
south
africa
the
of
the
african
assessment
rising
human
populations
in
many
developing
nations
would
require
new
policies
both
to
protect
nature
and
to
meet
goals
of
eradicating
poverty
and
hunger
by
in
europe
and
central
asia
wetlands
have
declined
by
half
since
threatening
many
species
amid
the
gloom
there
were
some
bright
spots
forest
cover
had
risen
by
percent
in
china
and
other
nations
in
northeast
asia
between
and
parks
and
other
protected
areas
were
expanding
in
many
regions
including
the
americas
and
and
populations
of
animals
such
as
the
iberian
lynx
amur
tiger
and
far
eastern
leopard
were
coming
back
from
the
brink
of
extinction
