oil
exports
from
southern
iraq
have
fallen
by
barrels
per
day
bpd
this
month
according
to
shipping
data
and
an
industry
source
suggesting
opec
s
producer
is
heading
for
a
third
month
of
lower
shipments
southern
iraqi
exports
in
the
first
days
of
march
averaged
about
million
bpd
compared
to
million
bpd
in
february
shipping
data
followed
by
reuters
and
independent
tracking
by
an
industry
source
showed
the
fall
suggests
there
is
still
no
sign
of
extra
supplies
reaching
the
market
from
iraq
even
though
oil
prices
rallied
this
year
to
a
barrel
for
the
first
time
since
supported
by
an
agreement
to
cut
output
iraq
says
it
is
committed
to
the
opec
deal
we
are
seeing
lower
volumes
the
source
who
tracks
iraq
s
exports
said
southern
shipments
have
fallen
as
one
of
the
single
point
loadings
used
to
fill
tankers
was
under
maintenance
for
part
of
march
because
of
a
leak
a
shipping
agent
said
also
loadings
have
dropped
at
the
small
port
of
khor
iraq
had
been
boosting
exports
from
its
southern
terminals
which
handle
the
bulk
of
such
trade
to
offset
a
halt
in
shipments
from
its
northern
kirkuk
oilfields
in
october
after
iraqi
forces
seized
control
of
fields
from
kurdish
fighters
northern
exports
have
averaged
bpd
so
far
in
march
compared
with
an
estimated
bpd
in
february
according
to
shipping
data
and
the
industry
source
that
is
far
below
levels
of
more
than
bpd
in
some
months
of
iraqi
oil
officials
say
there
are
no
plans
to
resume
oil
flow
through
the
pipeline
as
no
agreement
has
been
reached
yet
northern
exports
could
rise
if
iraq
goes
ahead
with
a
plan
to
export
kirkuk
oil
by
truck
to
iran
but
this
has
been
delayed
based
on
loadings
so
far
total
exports
in
march
have
averaged
million
bpd
down
from
million
bpd
in
february
million
bpd
in
january
and
million
bpd
in
december
according
to
iraqi
figures
and
loading
data
southern
shipments
reached
a
record
in
december
opec
russia
and
other
producers
are
cutting
output
by
about
million
bpd
until
the
end
of
in
an
effort
to
get
rid
of
a
global
crude
glut
and
support
prices
iraq
complied
less
with
the
supply
deal
than
its
opec
peers
such
as
saudi
arabia
and
kuwait
for
much
of
but
the
drop
in
kirkuk
output
boosted
iraqi
and
overall
compliance
