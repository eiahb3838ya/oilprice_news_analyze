turkmenistan
s
economy
depends
heavily
on
exports
of
natural
gas
and
came
under
stress
after
russia
once
the
biggest
buyer
halted
all
purchases
of
turkmen
gas
in
its
main
customer
now
is
china
and
the
ashgabat
government
is
building
a
new
pipeline
through
afghanistan
to
pakistan
and
china
in
an
attempt
to
open
up
new
export
markets
for
ordinary
turkmens
lower
export
revenues
have
manifested
themselves
in
foreign
currency
shortages
and
foreign
exchange
restrictions
the
black
market
flourished
as
a
result
where
the
turkmen
manat
currency
trades
at
less
than
a
third
of
its
official
value
