angry
venezuelan
oil

demanding

counter
crushing
hyperinflation
and

shortages
clashed
with
security
officials
during
a
rare
protest
in
the
cafeteria
of
state
oil
company
pdvsa
s
headquarters
on
friday
venezuela
is
home
to
the
world
s
largest
crude
reserves
but
its
creaking
economic
model
has
all
but
collapsed
sparking
inflation
and
long
lines
for
everything
from
milk
to
medicines
many
struggling
oil
workers
have
kept
mum
for
fear
of
losing
their
jobs
and
health
insurance
as
president
nicolas
maduro
s
government
takes
an
increasingly
tough
line
on
dissent
but
in
a
rare
display
of
public
anger
dozens
of
oil
workers
blocked
access
to
the
cafeteria
that
caters
to
pdvsa
and
the
adjacent
oil
ministry
during
lunch
hour
on
friday
to
demand
the
payment
of
delayed
benefits
three

close
to
pdvsa

pushing
and

are
heard
yelling
as

huge

towers
above
the

workers
also
shouted
resign
in
an
apparent
reference
to
current
pdvsa
president
and
oil
minister
manuel
quevedo
a
major
general
with
no
oil
experience
tapped
late
last
year
to
replace
his
predecessor
arrested
for
alleged
graft
the
poor
work
environment
comes
as
venezuela
s
oil
production
has
slipped
to
a
near
low
of
around
million
barrels
per
day
due
to
lack
of
investment
rampant
crime
in
isolated
oil
fields
and
a
brain
drain
