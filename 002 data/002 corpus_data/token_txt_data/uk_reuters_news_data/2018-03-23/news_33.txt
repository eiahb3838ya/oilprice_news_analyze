utilities step into blockchain to stay ahead of europe's energy shakeup

european
utilities
plan
to
begin
some
direct
trades
with
one
another
using
blockchain
technology
within
months
hoping
to
stay
ahead
in
a
world
in
which
individuals
may
eventually
sell
green
energy
to
one
another
the
distributed
ledger
technology
that
underpins
the
bitcoin
currency
has
already
been
tested
by
energy
operators
for
wholesale
trading
but
it
will
go
live
with
just
a
few
selected
electricity
and
gas
contracts
to
start
with
the
initiative
enerchain
is
a
forerunner
of
more
possible
uses
of
the
technology
by
established
energy
players
and
wider
options
explored
by
a
raft
of
to
harness
its
potential
many
of
them
years
away
from
execution
regulators
are
seeking
to
control
this
strategic
sector
to
avoid
security
issues
digital
infrastructure
is
lagging
and
players
must
agree
to
share
data
and
avoid
privacy
breaches
while
tentative
enerchain
is
a
test
of
the
utilities
ability
to
protect
their
margins
by
dominating
novel
automated
trading
architectures
matching
energy
producers
with
each
other
and
also
with
users
apart
from
staving
off
competition
from
more
agile
digital
companies
it
could
help
speed
a
sector
shift
in
germany
from
fossil
fuels
to
renewables
bypassing
nuclear
highlighted
in
a
reorganisation
of
and
rwe
this
month
german
it
company
ponton
has
worked
with
power
and
gas
traders
to
build
the
platform
since
managing
director
michael
merz
told
reuters
its
members
will
choose
contracts
to
go
live
with
as
soon
as
they
set
up
a
legal
entity
to
pool
budgets
probably
in
the
second
or
third
quarter
of
his
first
detailed
comments
on
the
timeline
to
mainstream
media
the
companies
which
include
prominent
names
such
as
italy
s
enel
germany
s
and
sweden
s
vattenfall
were
driven
by
the
need
to
lower
transaction
costs
in
an
era
of
growing
competition
and
energy
supplies
he
said
publishing
orders
and
transactions
via
blockchain
can
replace
trading
via
brokers
merz
said
we
have
developed
an
order
execution
process
that
works
just
like
a
typical
otc
market
front
alongside
brokers
potential
losers
from
the
enerchain
proposition
include
exchanges
such
as
ice
or
eex
but
both
are
joining
the
blockchain
party
ice
in
january
launched
a
cryptocurrency
data
feed
in
january
and
both
it
and
eex
are
discussing
applications
with
customers
and
tech
firms
we
see
this
new
technology
as
a
real
opportunity
to
further
improve
our
business

said
during
the
of

trade
fair
last
month
instead
of
administering
duplicate
databases
blockchain
comprises
one
record
maintained
by
a
network
of
participants
rather
than
a
centralised
entity
accessible
and
unchangeable

not
monopolise

leykam
said
while
enerchain
was
still
in
test
phase
we
are
confident
that
we
will
see
live
trades
this
year
when
all
necessary
technical
and
regulatory
prerequisites
are
germany
s
regulator
the
bundesnetzagentur
said
it
keeps
a
tight
watch
over
networks
and
retail
markets
where
suppliers
are
licensed
and
monitored
regardless
of
the
technology
they
use
matthias

bird
said
this
creates
high
entrance
hurdles
which
software
developers
should
build
into
their
processes
from
the
start
i
have
to
clarify
in
practice
that
i
can
only
sell
energy
when
i
ve
got
some
and
what
happens
at
other
times
he
said
two
or
more
suppliers
must
club
together
and
someone

also
part
of
the
enerchain
initiative
has
been
testing
blockchain
for
settling
gas
trades
via
the
platform
of
canadian
btl
with
the
likes
of
eni
and
bp
since
vattenfall
also
participates
in
that
test
consortium
called
btl
one
office
which
is
more
focused
on
trade
settlements
and
is
also
close
to
revealing
further
progress
energy
shipments
often
involve
lengthy
chains
of
documents
and
multiple
acknowledgement
receipts
even
electronic
platforms
with
central
clearing
functions
can
be
slow
and
expensive
while
blockchain
can
not
yet
take
on
billions
of
dollars
of
transactions
in
equities
or
currency
markets
handling
thousands
of
deals
per

energy
trades
are
not
overly
complex

financial

rules
with
high

requirements
did
not
apply
to
enerchain
as
it
is
defined
as
a
communication
channel
for

exchanges
if
successful
it
could
in

allow
the

to
pool

professional

as

christoph

enerchain
looked
well
placed
to
avoid
the
lack
of
trust
issues
that
have
caused
other
attempts
to
use

to
founder
this
is
a
nicely
focused
and
well
functioning
use
case
and
legal
questions
are
easily
resolved
he
said
new
infrastructure
is
needed
and
new
regulation
and
industry
standards
must
be
embedded
before
blockchain
can
transform
existing
mass
market
processes
experts
say
a
public
blockchain
may
involve
everyone
seeing

it
can

be
