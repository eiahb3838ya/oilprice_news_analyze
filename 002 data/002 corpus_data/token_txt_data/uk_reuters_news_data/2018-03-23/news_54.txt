mexico
s
president
on
thursday
defended
his
decision
to
open
the
energy
sector
against
attacks
from
the
man
currently
favourite
to
succeed
him
saying
a
rollback
of
the
measure
could
cost
the
country
billions
of
dollars
in
lost
investment
the
legislative
overhaul
that
ended
state
oil
firm
pemex
s
monopoly
was
the
centrepiece
of
president
enrique
pena
nieto
s
economic
agenda
and
leftist
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
who
is
leading
polls
for
the
july
presidential
election
has
threatened
to
unpick
it
speaking
in
the
state
of
veracruz
pena
nieto
said
those
calling
to
walk
back
the
reform
risked
condemning
mexico
to
an
obsolete
economic
model
without
naming
lopez
obrador
to
cancel
the
energy
reform
is
practically
to
make
disappear
the
investments
that
today
require
certainty
pena
nieto
said
at
the
inauguration
of
a
technology
centre
we
want
the
private
sector
to
invest
for
it
to
generate
returns
for
mexico
and
its
people
he
added
pena
nieto
said
over
jobs
and
billion
billion
worth
of
investment
ultimately
depended
on
the
energy
reform
s
success
he
is
barred
by
law
from
seeking
lopez
obrador
has
pledged
to
review
the
oil
and
gas
contracts
awarded
under
pena
nieto
s
government
if
elected
and
on
wednesday
evening
said
his
administration
would
consider
unwinding
the
energy
reform
legislatively
pena
nieto
s
reform
changed
the
constitution
to
grant
private
operators
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
production
rights
in
a
bid
to
reverse
years
of
declining
crude
output
however
the
reform
coincided
with
a
sharp
decline
in
oil
prices
and
the
government
has
said
it
will
take
time
for
the
of
the
energy
sector
to
bear
fruit
pledging
to
reduce
mexico
s
dependence
on
policies
sent
from
abroad
lopez
obrador
has
attacked
pena
nieto
s
economic
agenda
on
the
grounds
that
corruption
is
widespread
corruption
scandals
lacklustre
growth
and
rising
violence
have
battered
the
government
s
reputation
later
on
thursday
energy
minister
pedro
joaquin
coldwell
told
local
radio
that
to
undo
the
energy
reform
would
be
extremely
harmful
and
would
make
mexico
more
dependent
on
natural
gas
imports
and
deny
it
major
tax
revenues
joaquin
coldwell
noted
the
only
body
authorized
to
revoke
oil
and
gas
contracts
provided
serious
violations
are
shown
to
have
occurred
is
the
industry
regulator
the
national
hydrocarbons
commission
not
the
president
