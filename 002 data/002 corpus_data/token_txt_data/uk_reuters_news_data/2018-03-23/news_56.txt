update 1-boeing will not appeal trade case against bombardier - spokesman
montreal
reuters
boeing
co
will
not
appeal
against
the
trade
commission
ruling
that
allows
canada
s
bombardier
inc
to
sell
its
newest
jets
to
airlines
without
heavy
duties
a
boeing
spokesman
said
on
thursday
the
decision
by
boeing
puts
the
trade
challenge
to
rest
a
canadian
government
official
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
said
boeing
s
decision
was
good
news
the
international
trade
commission
itc
unanimously
voted
in
january
to
reject
boeing
s
complaint
and
discarded
a
commerce
department
recommendation
to
slap
a
near
percent
duty
on
sales
of
the
bombardier
cseries
jets
for
five
years
the
itc
had
widely
been
expected
to
side
with
boeing
the
world
s
largest
maker
of
jetliners
which
accused
bombardier
of
dumping
the
planes
or
selling
them
below
cost
in
the
market
however
the
itc
said
it
rejected
placing
duties
on
bombardier
jets
partly
because
boeing
had
lost
no
sales
or
revenue
when
delta
air
lines
inc
ordered
the
aircraft
in
from
the
canadian
planemaker
the
itc
ruled
the
cseries
jets
ordered
by
delta
and
boeing
s
smallest
max
plane
do
not
compete
the
smaller
end
of
the
jet
market
is
an
increasing
focus
for
the
major
manufacturers
airbus
se
has
agreed
to
take
a
majority
stake
in
the
cseries
in
a
deal
expected
to
close
later
this
year
while
boeing
is
in
talks
with
bombardier
s
brazilian
rival
embraer
sa
the
boeing
spokesman
declined
to
elaborate
on
the
decision
not
to
appeal
it
was
not
yet
clear
how
boeing
s
decision
will
impact
the
planemaker
s
relationship
with
the
canadian
government
which
is
holding
a
competition
for
fighter
jets
worth
between
c
billion
and
billion
