asia
s
oil
and
gas
producers
are
starting
to
revive
projects
aimed
at
deflating
years
of
ballooning
energy
imports
after
new
investment
dried
up
following
the
industry
crisis
spending
has
so
far
been
driven
mainly
by
state
oil
companies
such
as
india
s
ongc
thailand
s
pttep
and
petrovietnam
which
need
to
produce
more
oil
and

to
ensure
their
countries

security

said
this

event
in
kuala

malaysia
asia
is
by
far
the
biggest
consumer
of
oil
yet
its
output
is
falling
faster
than
in
any
other
region
that
mismatch
more
than
doubled
asia
s
oil
import
bill
to
around

billion
pounds

with

oilfield
service
providers
say
there
is
renewed
appetite
for
producers
to
spend
and
importers
to
cut
import
bills
by
investing
in

asia
is
a
net
importer
of

i
think
there
s
a
strong
desire
from
southeast
asian
organizations
to
change
that
trend
we
ll
see
a
lot
more
potential
developments
here
to
try
to
balance
that
equation

said
the
main
factors
deterring
investment
in
asia
were
tough
fiscal
regimes
cumbersome
bureaucracies
and
maturing
fields
with
limited
future
reserves
it
s
a
reality
check
for
governments
in
asia
to
look
at
how
much
investment
they
are
getting
and
how
they
need
to
improve
their
fiscal
terms
to
attract
more
investment

said
the
easy
oil
is
gone
what
is
left
is
deepwater
high
pressure
and
high
temperature
making
extraction
more
costly
but
given
competition
from
cheap
producers

from

said
there
was
pressure
to
keep
costs
low
while
oil
prices
are
showing
signs
of
recovery
the
sustainability
of
these
prices
remains
to
be
seen
if
we
don
t
keep
these
escalating
costs
in
check
the
industry
runs
the
risk
of
negating
the
value
