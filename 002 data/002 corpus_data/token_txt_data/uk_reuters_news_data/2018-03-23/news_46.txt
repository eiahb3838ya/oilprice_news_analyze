to
the
matter
the
fate
of
the
deal
one
of
the
largest
chinese
investments
in
russia
has
become
a
litmus
test
of
how
far
president
xi
jinping
s
government
is
prepared
to
go
with
a
crackdown
on
financially
risky
activities
among
conglomerates
the
acquisition
of

it
ceased
all

told
reuters
the

declined
to
say
how
much
had
been
paid
one
said
the
fact
some
money
has
changed

would
make
it
more
difficult
for
any
party
to
back
out
of
the
deal
cefc
founder
and
chairman
ye
was
put
under
investigation
by
chinese
authorities

to
comment
while
cefc
did
not
respond
to
a
reuters
request
for
comment
another
of
the
sources
said
it
was
difficult
to
predict
how
the
deal
would
unfold
one
thing
is
clear
though
the
kremlin
wants
china
to
own
a
stake
in
rosneft

china
has
long
said
it
wants
to
boost

immediately
respond
to

the
investigation
into
ye
who
founded
cefc
in
followed
mounting
concerns
among
chinese
authorities
about
the
finances
and
opaque
ownership
of
the
private
firm
which
has
grown
from
a
niche
fuel
trader
into
an
oil
and
finance
conglomerate
with
assets
across
the

an
