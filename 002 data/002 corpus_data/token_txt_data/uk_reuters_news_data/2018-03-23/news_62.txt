reuters
amnesty
international
on
friday
denounced
western
arms
sales
to
saudi
arabia
and
its
allies
in
a
coalition
battling
the
houthis
in
yemen
saying
such
traffic
made
a
mockery
of
a
global
arms
trade
treaty
the
rights
group
accused
both
the
coalition
forces
and
the
houthis
of
committing
potential
war
crimes
in
the
conflict
more
than
people
have
been
killed
in
yemen
since
march
when
saudi
arabia
and
other
sunni
muslim
arab
states
launched
a
military
campaign
against
the
houthis
a
group
of
shi
ite
fighters
who
had
seized
the
capital
and
forced
president
abd
rabbu
mansour
to
flee
there
is
extensive
evidence
that
irresponsible
arms
flows
to
the
saudi
coalition
have
resulted
in
enormous
harm
to
yemeni
civilians
lynn
maalouf
director
of
research
for
the
middle
east
at
amnesty
international
said
in
a
statement
but
this
has
not
deterred
the
usa
the
uk
and
other
states
including
france
spain
and
italy
from
continuing
transfers
of
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
such
arms
as
well
as
devastating
civilian
lives
this
makes
a
mockery
of
the
global
arms
trade
the
organisation
said
it
had
documented
coalition
air
strikes
since
that
appeared
to
have
violated
international
law
adding
that
some
may
amount
to
war
crimes
the
documented
attacks
had
killed
civilians
including
at
least
children
and
wounded
others
according
to
amnesty
it
said
the
houthis
and
their
allies
had
conducted
arbitrary
arrests
and
detentions
of
opponents
and
that
scores
of
men
and
women
had
been
subjected
to
enforced
disappearances
and
harsh
sentences
following
unfair
trails
saudi
arabia
and
its
allies
have
repeatedly
denied
allegations
of
war
crimes
and
say
their
campaign
is
directed
against
houthi
fighters
and
not
civilians
the
houthi
movement
has
also
denied
accusations
of
war
crimes
amnesty
said
that
as
the
conflict
enters
its
fourth
year
it
shows
no
real
signs
of
abating
and
that
all
sides
were
impeding
the
delivery
of
humanitarian
aid
to
at
least
million
people
in
need
of
assistance
and
more
than
one
million
suffering
from
suspected
cases
of
cholera
the
rights
group
said
that
despite
the
loosening
of
a
blockade
on
yemeni
ports
imposed
by
the
coalition
it
continues
to
impose
restrictions
on
aid
and
commercial
imports
of
essential
goods
two
rights
groups
in
france
said
on
friday
they
would
take
legal
action
against
the
french
government
unless
it
halts
sales
of
weapons
to
saudi
arabia
and
its
ally
the
