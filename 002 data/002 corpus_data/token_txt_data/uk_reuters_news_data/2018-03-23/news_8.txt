open

lenin

the
presidential
palace

launched
a
new
bidding
round
this

for
foreign

to
develop

and

opec
hopes
to
attract
some
million
in
investment
to
boost
production
that
the
government
says
is
vital
to
improve
its
sluggish
economy
but
women
from
amazon
indigenous
groups
say
oil
exploration
damages
their
livelihoods
the
environment
and
water
sources
on
ancestral
lands
and
comes
amid
growing
deforestation
in
unspoiled
areas
of
the
biodiverse
region
we
don
t
want
more
oil
and
mining
companies
alicia
cahuiya
of
the
waorani
group
told
the
president
at
the
meeting
oil
has
not
brought
development
for
the
waorani
it
has
only
left
us
with
oil
spills
and
the
women
also
told
the
president
who
was
flanked
by
several
ministers
that
the
government
was
failing
to
consult
properly
with
indigenous
communities
about
planned
oil
and
mining
projects
on
their
lands
a
right
they
are
entitled
to
under
law
the
oil
and
mining
issue
does
not
stop
worrying
me
because
there
is
a
future
to
take
care
of
moreno
said
at
the
meeting
which
was
streamed
live
on
facebook
what
you
are
completely
right
about
is
the
importance
of
dialogue
consensus
dialogue
decisions
about
any
decisions
of
my
government
with
respect
to
oil
and
mining
the
women
presented
the
president
with
a
list
of
demands
they
call
the
mandate
of
amazonian
women
which
includes
stopping
oil
mining
and
logging
projects
and
conducting
official
investigations
into
attacks
against
indigenous
leaders
i
hope
the
president
will
take
this
mandate
seriously
