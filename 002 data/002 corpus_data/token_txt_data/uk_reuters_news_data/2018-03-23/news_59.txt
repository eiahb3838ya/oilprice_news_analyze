british
prime
minister

may
urged
eu
leaders
to
seize
on
a
new
dynamic
in
brexit
talks
and
solve
differences
over
a
future
border
with
ireland
to
agree
a
deal
on
their
future
partnership
leaders
of
the
european
union
are
expected
to
sign
off
on
friday
on
an
offer
of
a
transition
period
and
set
out
their
terms
for
forthcoming
talks
on
trade
at
the
end
of
a
thursday
night
summit
dinner
may
took
to
the
floor
to
call
on
them
not
to
squander
that
opportunity
to
reach
an
overall
deal
by
securing
agreement
on
a
transition
period
to
allow
businesses
to
prepare
after
britain
leaves
the
bloc
in
march
next
year
may
now
faces
possibly
the
hardest
part
of
a
negotiation
that
has
already
shaken
her
grip
on
power
we
have
the
chance
now
to
create
a
new
dynamic
in
the
talks
to
work
together
to
explore
workable
solutions
in
northern
ireland
in
our
future
security
cooperation
and
in
order
to
ensure
the
future
prosperity
of
all
our
people
she
told
the
leaders
at
the
end
of
a
dinner
of
scallops
and
lamb
this
is
an
opportunity
it
is
our
duty
to
take
and
to
enter
into
with
energy
and
ambition
she
added
according
to
a
senior
british
official
may
hopes
the
expected
agreement
by
eu
leaders
on
friday
will
mark
the
start
of
the
end
of
punishing
talks
during
which
she
has
been
criticised
by
some
in
her
own
party
for
giving
too
much
away
to
brussels
and
failing
to
take
a
tough
enough
stance
some
critics
said
the
tone
had
been
set
for
those
talks
when
the
lights
went
out
at
a
meeting
she
had
called
with
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
and
french
president
emmanuel
macron
to
discuss
an
attack
on
a
former
moscow
spy
in
the
english
city
of
salisbury
which
britain
has
blamed
on
russia
may
under
pressure
from
brexit
supporters
in
her
conservative
party
for
settling
for
a
standstill
transition
with
the
eu
when
almost
nothing
changes
has
long
wanted
to
discuss
future
ties
with
the
bloc
a
conversation
her
government
believes
can
settle
some
of
the
thorniest
issues
one
such
problem
is
the
border
between
northern
ireland
and
eu
member
ireland
which
has
been
all
but
invisible
since
a
peace
agreement
was
signed
to
end
decades
of
sectarian
conflict
in
the
north
both
london
and
brussels
agree
there
should
be
no
hard
border
but
they
differ
over
how
that
can
be
achieved
may
has
suggested
a
customs
partnership
or
a
streamlined
arrangement
where
jointly
implemented
measures
and
the
use
of
technology
minimise
friction
eu
officials
reply
by
saying
the
easiest
way
to
secure
that
would
be
to
stay
in
its
customs
union
something
the
british
leader
has
ruled
out
the
standoff
has
left
a
backstop
agreement
that
could
see
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
staying
in
the
eu
s
customs
union
still
in
the
transition
text
although
subject
to
negotiators
finding
an
operational
compromise
that
for
some
brexit
campaigners
is
a
major
concern
but
a
senior
british
official
voiced
confidence
the
difficulties
over
the
border
could
be
resolved
now
that
the
two
sides
were
talking
about
the
future
once
we
move
on
to
this
stage
of
being
able
to
talk
about
the
future
relationship
that
is
where
we
believe
the
solution
to
the
irish
border
will
be
found
he
told
reporters
it
will
be
a
solution
in
terms
of
our
entire
relationship

the
