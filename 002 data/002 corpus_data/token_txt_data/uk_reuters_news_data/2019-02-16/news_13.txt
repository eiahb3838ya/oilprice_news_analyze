mexico
will
inject
billion
into
ailing
state
oil
company
pemex
officials
said
on
friday
promising
to
strengthen
its
finances
and
prevent
a
further
credit
downgrade
although
investors
saw
the
plan
as
only
a
fix
falling
oil
output
corruption
and
high
labor
costs
have
contributed
to
the
decline
of
the
company
that
was
once
a
symbol
of
national
pride
it
now
holds
roughly
billion
in
financial
debt
the
highest
of
any
national
oil
company
in
latin

fitch
and
moody
s

notch
above

fitch
said
on
friday
that
the
plan
which
includes
additional
tax
cuts
more
government
spending
on
the
company
and
debt
refinancing
would
likely
not
be
enough
to
prevent
continued
deterioration
in
pemex
s
credit
quality
the
agency
cited
an
ongoing
significant
level
of
underinvestment
for
pemex
pemex
will
receive
billion
in
pension
liability
monetization
as
part
of
the
new
plan
and
finances
will
be
helped
by
a
corruption
clampdown
officials
said
in
a
presentation
that
was
short
on
details
they
vowed
the
mexican
government
will
not
take
on
new
debt
in
pemex
must
make
more
than
billion
in
debt
payments
over
the
next
three
years
investors
said
they
had
expected
stronger
measures
and
while
encouraged
by
government
vows
of
support
they
said
the
plan
offered
only
relief
the
measures
are
not
a
long
term
fix
and
won
t
be
enough
to
stabilize
oil
output
said
edward
glossop
latin
america
economist
at
capital
economics
if
oil
prices
and
output
decline
further
he
estimated
yields
on
pemex
bonds
could
rise
by
around
percent
this
year
the
price
fell
after
the
announcement
for
pemex
s
most
heavily
traded
bond
on
friday
maturing
in
as
its
yield
rose
basis
points
according
to
marketaxess
data
the
price
on
a
pemex
bond
maturing
in
also
dropped
with
its
yield
up
basis
points
reflecting
bondholder
skepticism
of
the
plan
what
s
more
the
measures
will
do
little
to
shore
up
pemex
s
standing
with
the
ratings
agencies
said
julie
murphy
a
latin
america
analyst
at
jp
morgan
we
are
extremely
disappointed
with
the
measures
she
said
the
mexican
peso
weakened
by
more
than
half
a
percent
against
the
dollar
after
the
announcement
before
recovering
later
on
friday
over
time
pemex
taxes
will
go
down
and
the
capital
injection
will
allow
debt
refinancing
over
the
year
finance
minister
carlos
urzua
told
a
press
conference
if
pemex
requires
more
help
the
government
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
keep
pemex
s
finances
healthy
he
added
fitch
downgraded
debt
issued
by
pemex
by
two
steps
last
month
making
it
the
second
agency
after
moody
s
to
put
the
company
just
barely
within
its
investment
grade
category
the
move
stoked
fears
that
further
credit
downgrades
could
significantly
raise
pemex
s
financing
costs
and
result
in
dire
fiscal
consequences
for
the
government
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
who
took
office
in
december
and
ran
on
a
promise
of
strengthening
pemex
did
not
fully
detail
in
his
comments
at
the
news
conference
how
the
government
would
finance
the
company
s
lower
tax
bill
and
capital
injection
he
said
efforts
since
late
december
to
battle
rampant
fuel
theft
would
result
in
savings
of
about
billion
however
while
a
plan
to
increase
production
will
generate
more
resources
it
s
injecting
resources
it
s
lowering
the
tax
obligation
lopez
obrador
said
but
above
all
it
s
cleaning
out
corruption
from
investors
had
expected
a
stronger
response
said
luis
gonzali
a
portfolio
manager
at
franklin
templeton
investments
even
so
he
praised
the
administration
s
unconditional
support
to
double
down
on
relief
measures
if
necessary
wilbur
matthews
founder
of
vaquero
global
investment
also
saw
the
announcement
as
positive
it
is
a
good
sign
that
the
lopez
obrador
administration
recognizes
that
pemex
needs
to
change
profoundly
he
said
the
company
is
in
talks
with
lenders
to
potentially
raise
up
to
billion
this
year
