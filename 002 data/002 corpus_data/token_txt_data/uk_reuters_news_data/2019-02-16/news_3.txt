for
electric
company
cars
he
told
a
newspaper
on
saturday
the
government
s
latest
attempt
to
boost
demand
for
clean
vehicles
germany
is
trying
to
increase
electric
car
sales
in
the
wake
of
a
diesel
emissions
cheating
scandal
that
has
engulfed
its
auto
industry
in
the
last
three
years
half
of
all
cars
sold
in
germany
are
company
cars
scholz
told
the
frankfurter
allgemeine
sonntagszeitung
so
i
have
decided
that
we
will
not
end
tax
support
for
electric
cars
and
hybrid
company
cars
in
but
extend
them
maybe
over
the
whole
decade
he
said
adding
that
would
help
improve
air
quality
and
meet
climate
goals
he
added
however
that
the
rules
for
hybrids
would
be
tightened
so
that
only
cars
that
can
travel
on
electric
power
further
than
they
do
today
would
be
eligible
since
january
drivers
of
electric
company
cars
which
they
also
use
for
private
journeys
pay
less
tax
than
they
would
for
a
vehicle
with
a
combustion
engine
government
subsidy
schemes
have
helped
boost
sales
but
even
with
rising
demand
electric
cars
made
up
only
percent
of
new
car
registrations
last
year
according
to
the
kba
motor
vehicle
authority
the
government
has
acknowledged
it
will
miss
its
target
of
having
million
electric
vehicles
on
the
road

two
years
