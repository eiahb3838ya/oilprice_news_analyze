munich
reuters
vice
president
mike
pence
rebuked
european
powers
over
iran
and
venezuela
on
saturday
in
a
renewed
attack
on
washington
s
traditional
allies
rejecting
a
call
by
germany
s
chancellor
to
include
russia
in
global
cooperation
efforts
in
speeches
and
in
private
talks
at
the
munich
security
conference
pence
and
chancellor
angela
merkel
laid
out
competing
visions
for
how
the
west
should
address
world
crises
america
is
stronger
than
ever
before
and
america
is
leading
on
the
world
stage
once
again
pence
told
european
and
asian
officials
in
munich
listing
what
he
described
as
foreign
policy
successes
from
afghanistan
to
north
korea
and
urging
support
from
american
allies
america
first
does
not
mean
america
alone
he
said
hailing
the
results
of
donald
trump
s
presidency
as
remarkable
and
extraordinary
and
calling
on
the
eu
to
follow
washington
in
quitting
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
recognising
the
head
of
venezuela
s
congress
juan
guaido
as
the
country
s
president
addressing
an
audience
that
included
trump
s
daughter
ivanka
pence
s
speech
was
the
latest
attempt
by
a
trump
administration
official
to
put
the
president
s
america
first
agenda
into
a
coherent
policy
plan
european
leaders
are
troubled
by
trump
s
rhetoric
which
they
say
is
erratic
and
disruptive
citing
his
decision
to
pull
out
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
as
undermining
an
arms
control
agreement
that
prevented
tehran
from
developing
a
nuclear
bomb
but
pence
who
last
week
accused
britain
germany
and
france
of
undermining
sanctions
on
iran
repeated
his
demand
for
european
powers
to
withdraw
from
the
deal
the
time
has
come
for
our
european
partners
to
withdraw
from
the
disastrous
iran
nuclear
deal
he
said
and
later
pressed
merkel
over
the
issue
in
bilateral
talks
he
also
reiterated
to
her
washington
s
opposition
to
the
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
under
construction
between
russia
and
germany
under
the
baltic
sea
we
can
not
strengthen
the
west
by
becoming
dependent
on
the
east
pence
said
merkel
who
made
a
robust
defence
of
germany
s
foreign
trade
relations
and
ties
with
russia
during
her
speech
said
later
it
was
unreasonable
to
assume
that
russia
would
be
an
unreliable
energy
supplier
speaking
before
pence
merkel
questioned
whether
the
decision
to
leave
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
withdrawal
from
syria
was
the
best
way
to
tackle
tehran
in
the
region
during
a
session
she
added
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
exclude
russia
politically
but
pence
said
washington
was
holding
russia
accountable
for
its
seizure
of
ukraine
and
what
the
west
says
are
efforts
to
destabilise
it
through
cyber
attacks
disinformation
and
covert
operations
geostrategically
europe
can
t
have
an
interest
in
cutting
off
all
relations
with
russia
merkel
said
pence
who
used
his
trip
to
europe
to
push
trump
s
policy
of
favouring
sovereign
states
as
opposed
to
alliances
and
blocs
took
aim
at
the
eu
over
venezuela
s
political
crisis
today
we
call
on
the
european
union
to
step
forward
for
freedom
and
recognise
juan
guaido
as
the
only
legitimate
president
of
venezuela
he
said
calling
president
nicolas
maduro
a
dictator
who
must
step
down
in
his
roving
address
pence
also
stepped
up
pressure
on
chinese
telecoms
gear
companies
such
as
huawei
technologies
co
urging
allies
to
avoid
the
firms
and
saying
chinese
law
requires
them
to
give
beijing
access
to
networks
and
data
china
s
top
diplomat
yang
jiechi
rejected
pence
s
comments
chinese
law
doesn
t
require
companies
to
install
back
doors
to
collect
intelligence
yang
told
the
conference
yang
one
of
the
architects
of
chinese
foreign
policy
echoed
merkel
s
vision
saying
the
world
should
pull
together
to
address
global
challenges
while
former
vice
president
joe
biden
got
a
