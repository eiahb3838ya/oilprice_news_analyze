thousands
of

narrow
shafts
on
bamboo
ladders

mine

the
state
banned
such
unregulated
mining
in

it
still
goes

places

too
thought
there
was
little
chance

were
trapped
in
the
accident
it
was
not
clear
why
his
figure
differed

the
government
account

sayeb

said
he
has
survived

he
was
not
deep
inside
the
very
narrow
mine
shaft
when
disaster
struck
the
people
who
were
digging
coal
went
deep
inside
and
like
me
and
the
other
four

about
eight
to
feet
inside
