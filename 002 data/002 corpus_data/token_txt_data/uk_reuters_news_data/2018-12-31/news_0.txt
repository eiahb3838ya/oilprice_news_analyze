new
york
reuters
equities
around
the
world
rose
on
monday
as
possible
progress
in
resolving
the
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
engendered
some
investor
optimism
in
what
has
been
a
punishing
end
of
year
for
markets
the
benchmark
s
p
stock
index
advanced
in
light
trading
volume
after
president
donald
trump
said
he
held
a
very
good
call
with
china
s
president
xi
jinping
on
saturday
to
discuss
trade
and
said
big
progress
was
being
made
chinese
state
media
were
more
reserved
saying
xi
hoped
the
negotiating
teams
could
meet
each
other
halfway
and
reach
an
agreement
that
was
mutually
beneficial
the
rise
in
equities
mirrored
that
in
asian
and
european
markets
which
were
also
buoyed
by
trade
optimism
despite
monday
s
advance
equities
ended
the
year
largely
in
the
red
victims
of
investor
anxiety
over
trade
tensions
and
slowing
economic
growth
asian
and
european
shares
had
been
sluggish
for
much
of
the
year
and
in
recent
months
stocks
followed
suit
if
the
european
economy
continues
to
decelerate
and
the
chinese
economy
decelerates
because
of
tariffs
there
is
definitely
going
to
be
spillover
to
the
united
states
said
shannon
saccocia
chief
investment
officer
at

private
the

p
dropped
more
than
percent
in
december
its
largest
decline
since
the
great
depression
for
the
year
the

slid
more
than
percent
its
biggest
drop
since
the
financial
crisis
shares
outside
japan
ended
down
percent
for
the
year
while
the
stoxx
was
more
than
percent
lower
msci
s
gauge
of
stocks
around
the
globe
fell
percent
in
a
further
blow
to
the
chinese
economy
could
spur
a
quicker
resolution
to
the
trade
dispute
and
thus
boost
global
equities
saccocia
said
survey

on

showed
chinese
manufacturing
activity
contracting

the
first
time

the

in
treasury
yields
reflects
expectations
of
a
slowdown
if
not
a
pause
altogether
in
the
federal

s
progression
of

the
precipitous
drop
in

undermined
