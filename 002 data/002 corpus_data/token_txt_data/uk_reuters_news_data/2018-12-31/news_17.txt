oil
prices
edged
higher
on
the
last
trading
day
of
the
year
on
monday
taking
a
cue
from
firmer
stock
markets
but
remain
on
track
for
the
first
yearly
decline
in
three
years
amid
concerns
of
a
supply
glut
hints
of
progress
on
a
possible
trade
deal
helped
bolster
sentiment
which
has
been
battered
by
concerns
over
a
weaker
global
economic
outlook

this

crude
prices
have
been
closely
tracking
equity
markets
during
volatile
trading
for
both
asset
classes
last
week
investors
are
looking
for
bargains
in
an
illiquid
market
today
if
trump
gets
over
trade
issues
with
china
expect
economic
demand
to
surge
said
jonathan
barratt
chief
investment
officer
at
probis
securities
in
sydney
also
drivers
on
iran
with
waivers
ending
in
may
are
still
not
been
put
to
bed
hence
it
could
get
ugly
at
any
time
and
i
expect
this
is
a
diversion
for
trump
when
needed
barratt
added
president
donald
trump
said
he
had
a
long
and
very
good
call
with
chinese
president
xi
jinping
and
that
a
possible
trade
deal
between
the
united
states
and
china
was
progressing
well
meanwhile
imports
of
iranian
crude
oil
by
major
buyers
in
asia
hit
their
lowest
in
more
than
five
years
in
november
as
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
exports
took
effect
last
month
asia
s
imports
from
iran
are
set
to
rise
again
in
december
after
the
granted
temporary
waivers
to
some
countries
but
is
not
known
how
much
iran
will
be
able
to
export
once
the
waivers
expire
around
the
start
of
may
investors
will
require
substantive
indications
from
global
economic
fundamentals
and
oil
inventories
to
move
in
positively
on
oil
prices
in
said
benjamin
lu
jiaxuan
commodities
analyst
at
brokerage
firm
phillip
futures
we
postulate
for
a
gentle
recovery
for
oil
prices
into
the
first
quarter
of
though
marked
volatility
can
snap
oil
prices
south
in
lieu
of
market
uncertainties
and
key
events
such
as
brexit
trade
truce
deal
monetary
policy
the
current
downward
pressure
on
oil
prices
should
likely
taper
off
from
january
when
supply
cuts
commence
analysts
said
earlier
this
month
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
its
allies
including
russia
agreed
to
curb
output
by
million
bpd
starting
in
january
in
a
bid
to
clear
a
supply
overhang
and
prop
up
prices
