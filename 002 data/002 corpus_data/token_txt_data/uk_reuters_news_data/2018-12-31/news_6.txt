equities
around
the
world
rose
on
monday
with
wall
street
edging
up
in
choppy
trading
as
hints
of
progress
in
the
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
provided
a
rare
glimmer
of
optimism
in
what
has
been
a
punishing
end
of
year
for
markets
the
benchmark
s
p
stock
index
advanced
after
president
donald
trump
said
he
held
a
very
good
call
with
china
s
president
xi
jinping
on
saturday
to
discuss
trade
and
claimed
big
progress
was
being
made
chinese
state
media
were
more
reserved
saying
xi
hoped
the
negotiating
teams
could
meet
each
other
halfway
and
reach
an
agreement
that
was
mutually
beneficial
monday
s
upward
move
however
sheds
little
insight
into
the
state
of
markets
going
into
said
robert
phipps
director
at
per
stirling
capital
management
in
austin
texas
there
s
a
little
bit
of
a
positive
bounce
this
morning
on
seasonal
factors
and
the
fact
that
trump
tweeted
there
was
great
progress
being
made
on
the
china
negotiations
phipps
said
but
the
biggest
thing
going
on
is
very
large
reallocations
out
of
debt
and
into
equities
in
pension
plans
i
don
t
think
this
is
a
market
call
at
still
the
rise
in
equities
mirrored
that
in
asian
