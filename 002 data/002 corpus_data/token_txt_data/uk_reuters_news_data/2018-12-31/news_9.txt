hints

and
wall
street
futures
were
up
percent
as
traders
tried
to
overcome
the
worst
year
for
equities
since
the
financial
crisis
sentiment
had
improved
when
president
donald
trump
tweeted
that
he
held
a
very
good
call
with
china
s
president
xi
jinping
on
saturday
to
discuss
trade
and
claimed
big
progress
was
being
made
the
wall
street
journal
reported
the
white
house
was
pressing
china
for
more
details
of
how
it
might
increase
exports
and
loosen
regulations
that
stifle
companies
there
chinese
state
media
were
more
reserved
saying
xi
hoped
the
negotiating
teams
could
meet
each
other
and
reach
an
agreement
that
was
mutually
beneficial
economic
data
out

unhelpfully
mixed

msci
s

index

managed
a

gain
but
it
was
still
down
percent
for
the
year
a
of
top
chinese
companies
lost
more
than
a
quarter
of
its
value
the
story
was
much
the
same
across
the
globe
with
most
major
stock
indices
deep
in
the

paris
made
a

but

again
they
are
down

ahead

the

off
almost

its
worst
month
since
february
down
percent
for
the
quarter
and
percent
for
the
year
simply
looking
at
the
markets
would
suggest
that
the
global
economy
is
headed
into
recession
said
robert
michele
chief
investment
officer
and
head
of
fixed
income
at
morgan
asset
management
however
while
we
agree
the
global
economy
is
in
a
growth
slowdown
we
don
t
see
an
impending
recession
he
said
in
part
because
the
federal
reserve
could
provide
a
policy
cushion
already
commentary
out
of
the
fed
suggests
that
it
is
nearing
the
end
of
a
journey
to
normalise
policy
argued
michele
indeed
fed
fund
futures
have
now
largely
priced
out
any
rate
increase
for
next
year
and
now
imply
a
cut
by
the
treasury
market
clearly
thinks
the
fed
is
done
yields
on
debt
have
fallen
to
just
percent
from
a
peak
of
percent
in
november
the
trillion
market
is
heading
for
its
biggest
monthly
rally
in
years
according
to
an
index
compiled
by
bloomberg
and
barclays
european
bond
markets
were
closed
on
monday
but
the
drop
in
yields
has
undermined
the
dollar
in
recent
weeks
against
a
basket
of
currencies
it
was
on
track
to
end
december
with
a
loss
of
percent
but
remained
up
on
the
year
the
dollar
has
also
had
a
tough
month
against
the
yen
it
lost
percent
this
month
and
was
last
trading
at
just
under
however
was
mostly
stable
for
the
pair
trading
all
year
in
a
range
of
to
the
euro
was
on
track
to
end
the
month
higher
at
but
nursing
losses
of
almost
percent
over
the
year
sterling
made
a
last
push
to
but
brexit
woes
have
cost
it
more
than
percent
that
was
trivial
compared
with
the
drop
in
oil
prices
crude
is
down
almost
percent
since
its
peak
in
october
it
was
last
up
cents
at
a
barrel
but
down
percent
for
the
year
crude
futures
nudged
up
cents
to
gold
rallied
almost
percent
in
the
past
month
to
stand
at
an
ounce
copper
aluminium
zinc
and
nickel
however
were
all
down
to
percent
this
year
the
industrial
metals
are
sensitive
to
china
s
economy
which
consumes
almost
half
the
global
supply
the
supply
side
is
tight
but
my
fear
is
that
with
demand
weakening
it
will
offset
all
these
supply
concerns
so
we
could
see
inventories
begin
to
pick
up
