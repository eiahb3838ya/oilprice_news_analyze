across

the
worst
performer
of
the
year
was
the
index
of
chinese
blue
chips
which
lost
a
quarter
of
its

the
only
major
market
in

for

was
india
where
the
bse
was
ahead
by
almost
percent
the
story
was
much
the
same
across
the
globe
with
the
vast
majority
of
the
major

indices
in
the

the
s
p
is
off
almost
percent

its

since

that
left
it
down

and
percent
for
the

simply
looking
at
the
markets
would
suggest
that
the
global
economy
is
headed
into
recession
said
robert
michele
chief
investment
officer
and
head
of
fixed
income
at
morgan
asset
management
however
while
we
agree
the
global
economy
is
in
a
growth
slowdown
we
don
t
see
an
impending
recession
he
added
in
part
because
the
federal
reserve
could
provide
a
policy
cushion
already
commentary
out
of
the
fed
suggests
that
it
is
nearing
the
end
of
a
journey
to
normalise
policy
argued
michele
indeed
fed
fund
futures
have
largely
priced
out
any
hike
for
next
year
and
now
imply
a
quarter
point
cut
by
the
treasury
market
clearly
thinks
the
fed
is
done
on
hikes
with
yields
on
paper
having
fallen
to
just
percent
from
a
peak
of
percent
in
november
the
trillion
market
is
heading
for
its
biggest
monthly
rally
in
years
according
to
an
index
compiled
by
bloomberg
and
barclays
the
precipitous
drop
in
yields
has
undermined
the
dollar
in
recent
weeks
against
a
basket
of
currencies
it
was
on
track
to
end
december
with
a
loss
of
percent
but

still
up
on
the
year
as
a
whole
it
has
also
had
a
tough
month
against
the
yen
with
a

this
month
and

was
a
pretty
stable

it

all
of
it

range
of

the
euro
is
on
track
to
end
the
month
on
a
weaker
note
at
nursing
losses
of
almost
percent
over
the
year
to
date
that
was
trivial
compared
with
the
hit

taken
