reuters
india
s
finance
ministry
has
exempted
rupee
payments
made
to
the
national
iranian
oil
co
nioc
for
crude
oil
imports
from
a
steep
withholding
tax
according
to
a
government
order
reviewed
by
reuters
the
exemption
put
in
place
december
but
backdated
to
november
will
allow
indian
refiners
to
settle
about
billion
of
outstanding
payments
to
nioc
those
have
been
building
up
since
tehran
was
put
under
stringent
sanctions
in
early
november
the
two
countries
on
signed
a
bilateral
agreement
to
settle
oil
trades
through
an
indian
bank
uco
bank
in
the
indian
currency
which
is
not
freely
traded
on
international
markets
however
the
income
of
a
foreign
company
that
is
deposited
in
an
indian
bank
account
is
subject
to
a
withholding
tax
of
percent
plus
other
levies
leading
to
a
total
take
by
the
authorities
of
percent
that
made
the
agreement
unworkable
for
iran
and
led
to
the
freeze
in
payments
by
the
refiners
until
the
exemption
could
be
introduced
iran
will
be
able
to
use
the
rupee
funds
for
a
range
of
expenses
including
imports
from
india
the
cost
of
its
missions
in
the
country
direct
investment
in
indian
projects
and
its
financing
of
iranian
students
in
india
according
to
another
government
document
reviewed
by
reuters
it
can
also
invest
the
funds
in
indian
government
debt
securities
in
the
previous
round
of
sanctions
iran
was
allowed
to
use
funds
for
imports
from
india
but
this
time
we
have
expanded
the
scope
for
use
of
funds
to
benefit
both
nations
said
an
indian
government
official
who
declined
to
be
named
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
issue
the
move
may
help
india
fix
its
trade
balance
which
is
currently
tilted
in
favour
of
iran
the
tax
exemption
order
though
only
refers
to
crude
oil
that
means
it
does
not
apply
to
imports
of
other
commodities
such
as
fertiliser
liquefied
petroleum
gas
and
wax
