oil

edged

cuts

although
surging

over

analysts
warn

amid

cuts
led

because

some
said
that

risks
lately
as

are
currently
focused

bank
morgan
said
in
a
weekly
note
should
talks
to
end
trade
disputes
between
the
two
nations
have
a
positive
outcome
the
bank
said
oil
markets
would
switch
attention
from
macro
concerns
impacting
future
demand
growth
to
physical
tightness
and
geopolitical
risks
impacting
immediate
supply
but
surging
supply
and
a
potential
economic
slowdown
this
year
could
cap
oil
markets
the
worries
of
oversupply
stemming
from
the
will
likely
remain
a
dominant
theme
as
we
approach
the
warmer

morgan
stanley
said
the
surge
in
crude
oil
production
which
tends
to
be
light
in
quality
and
which
rose
by
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
last
year
to
a
record
million
bpd
had
resulted
in
overproduction
of
gasoline
light
crudes
naturally
yield
more
gasoline
and
together
with
relatively
modest
this
has
driven
gasoline
stocks
sharply
higher
and
crack
spreads
sharply
lower
in
recent
months
morgan
stanley
said
refining
profits
for
gasoline
have
plunged
since
going
negative
in
asia
and
europe
amid
tepid
demand
growth
and
a
surge
in
supply
as
a
result
morgan
stanley
said
low
refining
margins
and
weaker
economic
data
means
oil
prices
can
rally
only
so
much
and
we
continue
to
see
modest
upside
