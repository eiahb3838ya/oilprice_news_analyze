rpt-exclusive-u.s. epa may issue e15 gasoline plan without biofuel credit trade limits -sources
washington
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
is
considering
releasing
its
draft
proposal
to
expand
sales
of
higher
ethanol
blends
of
gasoline
without
including
simultaneous
measures
it
promised
the
oil
industry
to
curb
biofuel
credit
speculation
according
to
three
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
the
move
would
help
the
agency
lift
a
summertime
ban
on
sales
of
gasoline
in
time
for
the
driving
season
but
is
likely
to
anger
oil
refiners
that
had
been
asking
the
trump
administration
for
biofuel
credit
market
reforms
to
reduce
their
costs
if
epa
passed
on
introducing
biofuel
credit
trading
limits
it
would
leave
the
door
open
to
potential
speculative
price
surges
that
could
cost
refiners
like
valero
energy
corp
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
president
donald
trump
announced
in
october
he
was
directing
the
epa
to
allow
sales
of
in
a
win
for
the
powerful
corn
industry
which
supplies
ethanol
gasoline
contains
percent
ethanol
versus
the
percent
found
in
most
gasoline
the
ban
had
been
imposed
over
concerns
that
contributes
to
smog
in
hot
weather
president
trump
charged
epa
with
issuing
a
new
rule
on
rvp
and
rin
market
reform
and
doing
that
in
a
timely
manner
remains
our
goal
epa
spokesman
michael
abboud
said
in
email
comment
the
epa
had
initially
planned
to
combine
credit
trading
limits
into
the
rule
as
a
concession
to
the
oil
industry
which
says
speculation
increases
the
price
of
biofuel
credits
it
must
purchase
to
comply
with
federal
law
under
the
renewable
fuels
standard
oil
refiners
have
to
blend
increasing
volumes
of
biofuels
into
the
nation
s
gasoline
and
diesel
each
year
or
purchase
credits
called
renewable
identification
numbers
from
those
who
do
the
combined
draft
proposal
was
scheduled
for
release
this
month
and
was
meant
to
be
finalized
and
implemented
by
june
the
epa
has
been
seriously
looking
at
dropping
the
rin
reform
to
speed
up
the
process
on
one
industry
source
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
one
other
source
said
that
the
epa
had
already
decided
to
delay
the
credit
trading
limits
they
separated
the
rin
reform
to
ensure
that
the
rule
would
get
done
in
a
timely
manner
the
source
said
the
sources
asked
not
to
be
named
discussing
the
matter
the
agency
is
still
working
to
release
its
draft
rule
for
by
the
end
of
the
month
possibly
within
days
and
is
planning
to
expedite
the
process
to
finish
it
by
june
when
seasonal
driving
demand
picks
up
the
recent
partial
government
shutdown
in
the
united
states
had
raised
concerns
the
effort
might
not
be
completed
on
time
because

workers
were
furloughed

a
senior
epa
official
