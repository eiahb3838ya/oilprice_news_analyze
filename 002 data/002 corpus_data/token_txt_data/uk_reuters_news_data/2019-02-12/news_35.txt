world
shares
and
bond
yields
rode
a
renewed
surge
in
risk
appetite
on
tuesday
as
investors
turned
optimistic
about
trade
talks
and
cheered
washington
s
deal
to
avoid
another
government
shutdown
tokyo
s
nikkei
set
the
tone
with
its
best
day
of
the
year
so
far
and
as
europe
s
traders
hauled
the
stoxx
back
towards
highs
set
last
week
it
was
little
surprise
to
see
wall
street
futures
pointing
higher
germany
s
dax
jumped
as
much
as
percent
and
paris
and
milan
were
both
up
percent
though
london
s
ftse
lagged
amid
uk
plc
s
ongoing
brexit
uncertainty
the
other
big
focus
was
the
dollar
which
hovered
at
a
high
having
just
scored
its
longest
winning
streak
eight
days
straight
in
two
years
we
have
had
two
bits
of
relatively
good
news
overnight
optimism
about
the
shutdown
not
resuming
and
optimism
about
a
trade
deal
said
societe
generale
strategist
kit
juckes
equities
are
higher
bond
yields
are
a
little
bit
higher
yen
and
swiss
franc
weakest
of
the
major
currencies
so
it
s
sort
of
rules
ok
another
currency
the
australian
dollar
also
gained
and
as
well
as
the
japanese
yen
and
swiss
franc
treasuries
and
german
bunds
which
are
also
traditional
also
sold
off
juckes
said
he
reckoned
there
was
now
a
percent
chance
that
a
ratcheting
up
of
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
will
now
be
avoided
and
a
percent
chance
that
another
government
shutdown
will
be
averted
those
odds
got
a
boost
after
lawmakers
reached
a
tentative
deal
on
border
security
funding
though
aides
did
caution
that
it
did
not
contain
the
billion
president
donald
trump
wants
to
build
a
wall
on
the
mexican
border
and
chinese
officials
had
also
expressed
hopes
that
the
new
round
of
talks
which
began
in
beijing
on
monday
would
bring
them
closer
to
easing
their
near
trade
war
beijing
and
washington
are
trying
to
hammer
out
a
deal
before
a
march
deadline
without
which
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
are
scheduled
to
increase
to
percent
from
percent
there
will
be
no
winner
in
a
trade
war
so
at
some
point
they
will
likely
strike
a
deal

the
dramatic
turn
this
year
bank
of
america
said
emerging
markets
which
in
suffered
one
of
their
worst
years
on
record
were
now
the
most
crowded
trade
among
its
clients

p
futures
meanwhile
were
up
after
a
mixed
monday
with
industrial
bellwethers
boeing
and
caterpillar
and
some
major
chipmakers
all
up
in
moves
most
of
asia
had
nudged
higher
overnight
but
it
was
japan
s
nikkei
that
caught
the
eye
as
its
scored
its
best
day
of
the
year
so
far
with
a
percent
surge
having
started
the
day
at
a
low
with
the
yen
backtracking
shares
of
exporters
such
as
automakers
and
machinery

the
charge

noted
it
was
also
years
since
japan
cut
interest
rates
to
zero
something
now
standard
in
large
parts
of
europe
the
yen
s
weakness
came
as
the
dollar
consolidated
its
longest
unbroken
rally
in
two
years
against
a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
the
dollar
popped
up
to
a
high
of
yen
in
contrast
the
euro
dropped
to
as
low
as
its
weakest
in
months
and
last
traded
at

one
of
the
ecb
s
arch
hawks
was
suddenly
sounding
cautious
about
the
central
bank
ending
almost
a
decade
of
heavy
euro
zone
stimulus
at
this
moment
a
attitude
is
probably
the
optimal
attitude

said
in
an
interview
with
the
financial
times
although
the
federal
reserve

turn
dented
the

earlier
this
month
analysts
also
note
the
currency
still
has
the
highest
yield
among
major
fx
peers
and
that
the

continues
to
shrink
its

sheet
it
has
been
particular
strong
as
of
late
again

of
the
decoupling
