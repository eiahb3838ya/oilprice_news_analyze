that

on
a
green
new
deal
introduced
by
democrats
that
aims
to
slash
carbon
dioxide
emissions
to
negligible
levels
in
a
decade
i
ve
noted
with
great
interest
the
green
new
deal
and
we
re
going
to
be
voting
on
that
in
the
senate
give
everybody
an
opportunity
to
go
on
record
and
see
how
they
feel
about
the
green
new
deal
mcconnell
said
the
document
introduced
last
week
marked
the
first
formal
attempt
by
lawmakers
to
define
legislation
to
create
big
investments
in
clean
energy
infrastructure
and
social
programs
the
goal
is
to
transition
the
economy
away
from
burning
fossil
fuels
and
emitting
greenhouse
gasses
blamed
for
climate
change
rising
sea
levels
and
severe
storms
the
initiative
was
unveiled
by
democratic
representative
alexandria
a
rising
political
star
and
senator
edward
markey
the
initiative
has
the
backing
of
almost
all
the
democrats
declared
as
candidates
seeking
for
the
party
s
nomination
in
the
presidential
election
markey
said
mcconnell
s
call
for
a
vote
before
hearings
and
a
national
debate
on
the
green
new
deal
was
an
attempt
to
sabotage
the
plan
they
republicans
have
offered
no
plan
to
address
this
economic
and
national
security
threat
and
want
to
sabotage
any
effort
that
makes
big
oil
and
corporate
polluters
pay
he
said
in
a
statement
republicans
have
used
the
green
new
deal
to
try
to
sow
discord
within
the
democratic
party
painting
their
political
rivals
as
shifting
to
the
left
and
embracing
extreme
policies
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
had
called
the
green
new
deal
a
green
dream
and
some
democrats
in
fossil
or
rural
districts
have
stayed
quiet
on
their
position
republican
senator
john
barrasso
chair
of
the
senate
environment
committee
said
democrats
were
proposing
a
plan
that
raises
taxes
that
overthrows
really
a
productive
energy
market
that
we
have
right
now
in
this
country
raises
energy
costs
forces
people
out
of
work
who
are
working
in
the
energy
barrasso
represents
the
state
of
wyoming
the
plan
outlines
some
of
the
most
aggressive
climate
goals
ever
put
forward
by
democratic
lawmakers
and
clashes
dramatically
with
the
trump
administration
s
efforts
to
advance
domestic
oil
gas
and
coal
production
by
rolling
back
environmental
protections
some
democrats
hit
back
at
the
republican
attempt
to
call
for
a
vote
on
the
resolution
before
hearings
and
debates
take
place
calling
it
a
cynical
move
instead
of
trying
to
cause
mischief
the
republican
party
should
put
forward
its
own
serious
proposal
to
address
climatechange
democratic
senator
sheldon
whitehouse
wrote
on
twitter
on
tuesday
president
donald
trump
s
administration
opposes
action
on
climate
change
and
favors
boosting
production
of
oil
gas
and
coal
on
monday
trump
poked
fun
at
the
green
new
deal
at
his
campaign
rally
in
el
paso
texas
making
exaggerated
claims
that
the
policy
would
force
people
to
give
up
air
travel
and
owning
cows
a
source
of
methane
emissions
i
really
don
t
like
their
policy
of
taking
away
your
car
of
taking
away
your
airplane
rights
of
let
s
hop
a
train
to
california
of
you
re
not
allowed
to
own
cows
anymore
trump
said
at
the
rally
the
name
green
new
deal
references
the
new
deal
of
the
that
president
franklin
roosevelt
implemented
to
aid
americans
suffering
in
the
great
depression
by
embarking
on
huge
infrastructure
projects
