at
mtwapa
near

the

awareness
of
the
threat
plastics
pose
to
the
oceans
said
chief
and
captain
ali
skanda
beaches
and
marine
ecosystems
have
been
badly
affected
by
plastics
skanda
said
adding
it
was
time
to
change
local
people
s
mindset
on
how
they
handle
and
dispose
of
waste
that
s
why
we
started
this
voyage
to
reach
out
to
communities
in
east
africa
and
also
globally
he
said
the
boat
s
voyage
took
it
km
miles
south
from
lamu
island
in
kenya
to
zanzibar
in
neighbouring
tanzania
over
two
weeks
starting
on
along
the
way
the
boat
made
six
stops
with
its
crew
joining
local
people
schools
and
officials
for
beach
and
events
highlighting
the
effect
of
plastic
pollution
on
the
seas
the
motivation
for
and
fisherman
hassan
mohammed
was
seeing
how
much
has
changed
in
recent
decades
until
years
ago
the
shore
at
mtwapa
was
free
of
pollution
he
said
but
tourism
has
meant
increased
use
of
plastic
carrier
bags
and
bottles
which
has
harmed
the
ocean
when
i
started
fishing
the
only
people
around
were
fishermen
and
fisherwomen
and
we
used
woven
baskets
and
no
plastics
he
said
nowadays
many
people
have
started
local
businesses
like
hotels
along
the
shores
and
contributed
to
a
huge
mess
as
you
can
see
the
place
is
littered
with
plastic
bottles
he
added
the
flipflopi
built
from
tonnes
of
plastic
waste
was
first
launched
late
last
year
ben
morison
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
he
began
working
on
the
project
in
to
transmit
the
message
about
the
impact
that
plastic
is
having
on
marine
ecosystems
how
this
affects
us
and
most
important
of
all
what
we
can
do
about
it
researchers
estimate
the
world
has
produced
more
than
billion
tonnes
of
plastic
since
the
early
according
to
un
environment
of
all
plastic
waste
just
percent
has
been
recycled
its
website
says
about
percent
was
incinerated
while
the
rest
ended
up
in
dumps
landfill
or
loose
in
the
environment
in
partnership
with
the
seas
campaign
the
mombasa
county
government
committed
to
help
keep
plastic
waste
off
its
beaches
by
closing
its
biggest
dump
kibarani
and
turning
it
into
a
natural
space
by
planting
trees
un
environment
has
been
working
with
the
local
government
to
clean
up
and
rehabilitate
the
kibarani
dump
which
has
emptied
waste
into
the

for
years
according
to
mombasa
county
governor

the

s
importance
as
a
tourism
destination
meant
there
was
a
need
for
proper
waste
management
he
said
we
have
serious
historical
damages
to
our
environment
that
we
need
to
deal
with
the
amount
of
plastics
waste
that
was
here
was
unbelievable
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
we
decided
to
change
this
but
kibarani
is
just
a
fraction
he
said
adding
mombasa
needs
million
each
financial
year
to
efficiently
manage
its
waste
still
we
are
happy
we
are
on
the
right
track

faces
a
significant
funding
gap
of
up
to

in
tackling
