timi
soleye
returned
home
to
nigeria
from
the
united
states
to
set
up
a
gas
logistics
business
six
years
ago
encouraged
by
predictions
of
growth
and
an
expanding
middle
class
three
years
later
nigeria
plunged
into
its
first
recession
in
a
generation
following
a
sharp
fall
in
the
price
of
oil
which
accounts
for
percent
of
its
foreign
exchange
earnings
infrastructure
projects
on
which
soleye
s
business
relied
were
shelved
he
kept
afloat
by
doing
consultancy
work
but
others
weren
t
so
lucky
i
know
lots
of
people
whose
companies
shut
and
laid
people
off
said
soleye
a
harvard
graduate
and
president
of
cryo
gas
and
power
soleye
didn
t
bother
to
vote
in
but
this
year
he
says
he
has
a
reason
to
do
so
he
doesn
t
want
president
muhammadu
buhari
to
win
a
second
term
on
enough
is
enough
he
said
buhari
s
critics
accuse
him
of
failing
on
a
number
of
issues
including
promises
to
tackle
corruption
and
defeat
an
islamist
insurgency
that
has
killed
thousands
since
he
took
the
helm
of
africa
s
most
populous
nation
but
his
handling
of
the
economy
could
cost
buhari
more
votes
than
any
other
issue
although
nigeria
returned
to
growth
in
the
economy
expanded
by
percent
in
compared
with
percent
when
soleye
returned
to
nigeria
in
inflation
has
been
in
double
digits
for
the
last
three
years
rising
to
a
high
of
percent
in
december
and
nearly
a
quarter
of
the
workforce
percent
is
unemployed
up
from
percent
a
year
earlier
people
are
still
worse
off
after
four
years
in
power
said
charles
robertson
chief
economist
at
renaissance
capital
it
s
not
all
buhari
s
fault
it
s
mainly
to
do
with
oil
but
nonetheless
it
s
made
it
difficult
for
people
to
be
positive
about
the
for
clement
nweke
who
sells
electrical
appliances
in
a
lagos
street
market
the
last
few
years
have
been
hard
inflation
and
a
weaker
currency
mean
naira
will
only
buy
one
of
his
air
conditioning
units
compared
with
three
back
in
the
purchasing
power
from
the
public
is
lower
he
said
it
affects
my
own
business
because
i
don
t
push
out
the
many
units
i
used
buhari
s
main
rival
businessman
and
former
vice
president
atiku
abubakar
has
zeroed
in
on
the
issue
get
nigeria
working
again
is
his
campaign
slogan
he
has
vowed
to
double
the
size
of
the
economy
to
billion
by
mainly
by
giving
a
larger
role
to
the
private
sector
buhari
argues
that
the
way
to
bigger
growth
is
through
infrastructure
development
touting
railway
and
road
construction
but
many
business
leaders
doubt
he
can
fix
the
economy
saying
their
companies
have
been
hurt
by
government
efforts
to
help
the
poor
in
their
quest
for
what
they
call
affordability
they
have
essentially
price
regulated
a
huge
bevy
of
things
and
they
do
not
see
that
ironically
it
makes
things
more
expensive
said
soleye
he
said
a
decision
to
fix
energy
tariffs
for
three
years
meant
that
while
customers
were
getting
cheap
electricity
crippling
debts
were
piling
up
in
nigeria
s
power
sector
those
debts
have
held
up
construction
of
new
plants
for
which
soleye
s
company
would
have
provided
gas
storage
and
pipelines
another
example
is
the
government
s
decision
to
ban
rice
imports
through
its
land
borders
in
instead
the
government
subsidised
tractors
mills
and
fertiliser
and
arranged
cheaper
loans
to
boost
domestic
rice
production
but
farmers
struggled
to
meet
demand
hampered
by
poor
roads
to
bring
their
harvest
to
market
and
inadequate
power
for
storage
facilities
prices
soared
the
only
people
who
did
well
were
smugglers
said
rotimi
williams
who
owns
a
rice
farm
in
the
central
state
of
nasarawa
the
cost
of
production
of
local
rice
has
increased
which
means
that
people
are
going
for
cheaper
imported
rice
he
said
he
blames
protectionist
policies
for
nigeria
s
galloping
inflation
the
government
says
it
is
trying
to
wean
the
economy
off
its
reliance
on
oil
sales
by
encouraging
domestic
production
of
everything
from
wheat
to
cars
some
local
businesses
have
profited
etop
ikpe
ceo
of
an
online
marketplace
for
used
vehicles
said
a
decision
to
increase
a
tariff
on
imported
vehicles
from
to
percent
in
provided
an
opportunity
people
couldn
t
afford
brand
new
cars
or
imported
used
cars
he
said
but
as
with
rice
the
nigerian
ports
authority
reported
a
surge
in
car
smuggling
from
neighbouring
benin
and
local
assembly
did
not
pick
up
buhari
s
supporters
point
out
that
nigeria
rose
places
to
in
the
world
bank
s
ease
of
doing
business
ranking
in
largely
due
to
government
efforts
to
cut
red
tape
including
issuing
visas
on
arrival
and
establishing
a
centralized
electronic
system
to
pay
federal
taxes
one
good
term
deserves
another
says
an
electronic
billboard
for
buhari
in
the
lagos
business
district
of
victoria
island
how
voters
respond
may
depend
on
whether
they
believe
they
will
be
better
off
with
atiku
who
as
vice
president
from
to
oversaw
the
liberalisation
of
nigeria
s
telecommunications
industry
foreign
investors
have
welcomed
his
pledges
to
float
the
naira
overhaul
the
central
bank
privatise
the
state
oil
company
and
create
a
billion
fund
to
support
private
sector
infrastructure
investment
the
central
bank
with
buhari
s
backing
imposed
currency
restrictions
in
to
defend
the
naira
rejecting
bankers
advice
to
float
the
currency
as
some
other
oil
exporters
had
done
the
following
year
the
naira
lost
a
third
of
its
value
and
many
investors
fled
capital
imports
into
nigeria
which
stood
at
billion
in
fell
to
billion
in
before
rising
to
billion
as
the
country
emerged
from
recession
in
if
we
want
to
see
the
unemployment
rates
coming
down
and
certain
initiatives
that
will
boost
growth
primarily
it
will
be
private
sector
driven
