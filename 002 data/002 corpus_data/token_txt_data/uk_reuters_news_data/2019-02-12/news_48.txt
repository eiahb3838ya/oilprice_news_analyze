minister
peter
altmaier
said
on
tuesday
he
was
optimistic
that
germany
would
build
two
terminals
in
the
foreseeable
future
to
import
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
as
germany
phases
out
nuclear
power
and
coal
it
is
increasingly
turning
to
gas
to
compliment
renewable
energy
sources
it
is
under
pressure
especially
from
the
united
states
to
cut
its
dependence
on
russian
gas
and
buy
in
lng
altmaier
told
a
meeting
with
german
and
energy
officials
and
industry
lobbyists
that
germany
was
weighing
up
the
extent
of
state
subsidies
and
regulations
before
private
investors
build
the
terminals
needed
for
lng
imports
of
three
sites
under
consideration
brunsbuettel
stade
and
wilhelmshaven
altmaier
was
confident
terminals
would
be
built
at
two
in
the
foreseeable
future
all
three
projects
are
being
carefully
considered
and
examined
he
said
i
am
quite
optimistic
that
at
least
two
of
the
terminals
will
be
realised
within
a
very
foreseeable
period
of
altmaier
made
clear
that
the
question
of
lng
was
a
separate
issue
to
nord
stream
pipeline
backed
by
germany
which
will
bring
russian
gas
to
europe
under
the
baltic
sea
bypassing
ukrainian
pipelines
ukraine
is
concerned
that
the
km
mile
pipeline
will
lead
to
a
dramatic
loss
in
transport
revenues
but
germany
is
trying
to
reassure
kiev
that
gas
will
still
be
transported
from
russia
through
ukraine
s
existing
pipeline
the
intention
is
to
come
as
soon
as
possible
to
a
new
agreement
between
russia
and
ukraine
