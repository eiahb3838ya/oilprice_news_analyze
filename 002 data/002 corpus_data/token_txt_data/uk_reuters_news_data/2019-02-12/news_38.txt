gold
is
in
talks
to
build
a
megawatt
solar
power
plant
in
the
free
state
province
to
supply
power
to
some
of
its
operations
to
try
to
reduce
power
costs
and
dependence
on
struggling
utility
eskom
eskom
which
produces
over
percent
of
south
africa
s
electricity
is
saddled
with
more
than
billion
in
debt
and
has
had
to
impose
some
of
the
country
s
worst
power
cuts
in
years
over
the
past
few
days
eskom
s
troubles
are
a
big
headache
for
heavy
energy
users
in
south
africa
particularly
gold
mining
companies
our
eskom
bill
is
massive
to
replace
eskom
would
be
a
fallacy
we
won
t
be
able
to
do
that
we
can
however
where
we
have
long
term
projects
we
can
start
building
solar
plants

harmony
said
it
was
in
talks
with
the
state
energy
regulator
over
a
licence
to
build
a
solar
power
plant
in
welkom
in
the
free
state
province
we
have
gone
through
the
procurement
process
and
we
have
now
managed
to
bed
down
a
developer
and
an
investor
in
a
megawatt
facility
in
welkom
which
will
relieve
some
of
our
dependence
on
eskom

said
the
company

uses
around
megawatts

plans
to
use
the
solar
plant
to
help
to
supply
its
longer
life
assets
including
its
tshepong
operations
in
the
free
state
harmony
said
it
had
also
taken
action
to
reduce
consumption
during
peak
periods
and
improved
efficiency
of
pumping
operations
eskom
said
last
week
it
was
requesting
steeper
electricity
tariff
increases
from
the
energy
regulator
of
percent
in
percent
in
and
percent
in
the
utility
also
implemented
a
third
day
of
planned
power
cuts
on
tuesday
because
of
a
shortage
of
generating
capacity
that
will
change
that
will
change
life
of
mines
that
will
have
an
impact
on
jobs
if
eskom
continues
with
the
very
high
increases
harmony
ceo
steenkamp
said
harmony
also
reported
a
percent
drop
in
profit
on
tuesday
on
the
back
of
higher
costs
and
depreciation
and
a
weaker
rand
even
though
gold
production
rose
percent
to
ounces
by
gmt
shares
in
harmony
were
up
percent
to
rand
on
the
back
of
a
robust
operational
performance
they
had
a
number
of
acquisitions
which
they
had
done
in
the
previous
financial
year
that
had
one
off
items
which
impacted
their
profitability
but
from
an
operational
point
of
view
the
business
has
done
considerably
well
