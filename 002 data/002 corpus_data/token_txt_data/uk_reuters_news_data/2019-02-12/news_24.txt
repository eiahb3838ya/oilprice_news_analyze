a
railway
link
would
be
a
waste
of
public
money
and
have
a
strongly
negative
financial
impact
italy
s
transport
ministry
said
on
tuesday
in
a
report
that
will
heighten
tensions
within
the
coalition
work
has
already
started
on
a
tunnel
that
cuts
through
the
alps
and
is
forecast
to
cost
billion
euros
billion
with
france
and
the
european
union
joining
with
italy
to
foot
the
bill
the
whole
rail
link
which
is
backed
by
the
ruling
league
party
but
fiercely
opposed
by
its
government
partner
the
movement
has
a
price
tag
of
more
than
billion
euros
italy
s
transport
ministry
says
the
analysis
estimated
that
the
cost
of
building
the
tav
route
and
its
projected
economic
return
produced
a
negative
balance
of
between
billion
euros
billion
as
everyone
can
now
see
for
themselves
the
numbers
of
this
economic
and
transport
analysis
are
extremely
negative
said
transport
minister
danilo
toninelli
a
politician
who
commissioned
the
contested
report
it
is
now
up
to
the
government
to
make
a
the
league
says
the
line
connecting
the
french
city
of
lyon
with
turin
is
vital
to
italy
s
economy
it
made
no
immediate
comment
on
tuesday
has
repeatedly
said
it
will
never
sanction
the
project
while
it
remains
in
power
league
leader
matteo
salvini
has
suggested
a
referendum
to
decide
the
matter
a
separate
analysis
published
by
italy
s
transport
ministry
predicted
that
it
could
cost
up
to
billion
euros
billion
pounds
to
halt
work
at
this
stage
through
possible
contract
penalties
france
agreed
last
december
to
freeze
new
contracts
on
the
tunnel
boring
operation
until
the
italian
government
which
took
office
last
june
had
completed
the
analysis
relations
between
paris
and
rome
have
since
deteriorated
and
president
emmanuel
macron
last
week
recalled
france
s
ambassador
to
rome
following
a
war
of
words
with
both
the
league
and
which
have
accused
paris
of
undermining
italy
s
economic
foreign
and
migrant
policies
france
and
italy
are
respectively
each
others
second
biggest
trading
partners
and
business
leaders
on
both
sides
of
the
alps
say
the
tav
will
facilitate
commerce
rome
is
also
at
loggerheads
with
the
european
commission
over
its
plans
for
an
expansive
budget
however
toninelli
said
these
disputes
had
no
bearing
over
the
tav
analysis
i
want
to
stress
that
the
negative
evaluation
of
the
link
that
emerges
from
this
analysis
is
not
against
the
eu
or
against
france
