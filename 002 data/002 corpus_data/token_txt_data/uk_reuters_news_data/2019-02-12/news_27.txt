south
african
power
utility
eskom
implemented
major
electricity
cuts
for
a
third
straight
day
on
tuesday
as
a
shortage
of
generating
capacity
exposed
the
frailty
of
the
struggling
firm
despite
government
promises
to
revive
it
president
cyril
ramaphosa
is
trying
to
reform
eskom
which
supplies
more
than
percent
of
the
power
in
africa
s
most
industrialised
economy
but
is
drowning
in
more
than
billion
of
debt
to
lift
the
economy
before
an
election
in
may
the
utility
said
it
would
cut
megawatts
mw
of
power
from
the
national
grid
from
gmt
on
tuesday
likely
until
gmt
a
day
after
cutting
mw
in
the
worst
power
cuts
seen
in
several
years
around
a
third
of
eskom
s
mw
capacity
is
offline
public
enterprises
minister
pravin
gordhan
told
parliament
on
tuesday
that
south
africa
had
asked
italian
energy
firm
enel
for
technical
assistance
to
end
the
power
cuts
enel
will
be
sending
two
to
three
coal
power
station
engineers
to
south
africa
shortly
gordhan
said
these
outages
have
a
massive
impact
on
the
economy
from
mining
big
industries
manufacturing
to
small
businesses
like
coffee
shops
he
said
a
senior
generation
official
andrew
etzinger
told
reuters
that
around
mw
was
offline
because
of
problems
while
approximately
mw
was
out
of
service
because
of
planned
maintenance
a
further
mw
was
unavailable
because
of
a
shortage
of
diesel
oil
company
petrosa
said
it
was
in
talks
with
eskom
over
emergency
diesel
supplies
the
power
crisis
prompted
an
urgent
meeting
of
eskom
s
board
of
directors
and
executives
with
gordhan
on
monday
when
it
also
pummelled
the
rand
currency
on
tuesday
the
rand
was
little
changed
against
the
dollar
etzinger
said
eskom
was
aiming
to
end
the
power
cuts
by
the
end
of
the
week
by
bringing
some
generating
units
back
online
the
cuts
are
prompting
frustration
among
ordinary
south
africans
and
shop
workers
many
of
whom
do
not
have
access
to
backup
power
sources
like
diesel
generators
we
re
struggling
said
eunice
mashaba
a
manager
of
a
textile
shop
north
of
johannesburg
yesterday
the
power
went
off
at
half
past
four
so
we
had
to
close
the
shop
early
today
we
came
in
and
there
was
no
power
most
of
my
customers
don
t
carry
cash
they
have
to
swipe
and
the
card
machine
doesn
t
some
firms
in
the
mining
sector
the
backbone
of
the
country
s
economy
are
looking
at
alternatives
to
reduce
their
dependence
on
eskom
miner
harmony
gold
said
on
tuesday
that
it
was
in
talks
to
build
a
mw
solar
plant
to
supply
power
to
some
of
its
assets
in
an
effort
to
cut
its
electricity
costs
and
dependence
on
eskom
our
eskom
bill
is
massive
to
replace
eskom
would
be
a
fallacy
we
won
t
be
able
to
do
that
however
where
we
have
projects
we
can
start
building
solar
plants
harmony
chief
executive
peter
steenkamp
said
at
a
presentation
of
the
company
s
results
ramaphosa
who
announced
a
plan
last
week
to
split
eskom
into
three
separate
entities
in
an
effort
to
make
it
more
efficient
has
said
the
latest
power
cuts
are
most
worrying
the
president
s
plan
to
split
eskom
faces
opposition
from
powerful
labour
unions
and
from
within
his
ruling
african
national
congress
party
while
some
analysts
have
said
a
bolder
approach
is
needed
to
address
the
financial
rot
at
the
utility
etzinger
said
eskom
was
for
now
treating
unplanned
outages
at
some
of
its
power
stations
as
technical
breakdowns
despite
speculation
from
analysts
that
disgruntled
union
members
could
have
sabotaged
some
units
there
s
no
reason
to
believe
it
s
sabotage
