rose

official

making
it
increasingly
unlikely
they
will
meet
their
winter

average

of
small

known
as
in

major

climbed

from
a

according
to

analysis
of
official
pollution
data
china
has
vowed
not
to
ease
up
when
it
comes
to
fighting
pollution
even
amid
an
economic
slump
but
rising
emissions
of
smog
last
month
suggests
that
some
provinces
could
struggle
to
balance
that
goal
with
an
upturn
in
industrial
production
the
reasons
for
the
increases
in
levels
are
not
hard
to
identify
said
lauri
myllyvirta
energy
analyst
with
environmental
group
greenpeace
who
noted
that
steel
thermal
power
and
cement
production
surged
throughout
the
region
in
the
final
quarter
of
the
outsourcing
of
industrial
output
that
took
place
last
winter
in
order
for
beijing
to
hit
its
air
quality
targets
was
reversed
this
winter
driving
air
pollution
levels
up
in
the
region
while
the
rest
of
the
country
has
seen
the
worst
performer
over
the
month
was
the
coal
city
of
linfen
in
shanxi
province
which
saw
average
levels
of
micrograms
up
percent
from
a
year
earlier
shijiazhuang
the
provincial
capital
of
hebei
china
s
biggest
steelmaking
region
also
saw
emissions
rise
percent
to
micrograms
china
s
official
air
quality
standard
is
micrograms
while
the
world
health
organization
recommends
an
annual
average
of
no
more
than
over
the
three
months
beginning
in
november
when
heating
systems
are
switched
on
throughout
the
north
average
in
the
cities
reached
micrograms
up
percent
on
the
year
anyang
a
coal
and
steel
producing
city
in
henan
province
was
the
worst
performer
over
that
period
with
average
concentrations
at
micrograms
up
percent
henan
has
blamed
its
poor
performance
this
winter
on
unfavourable
weather
conditions
china
s
environment
ministry
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
however
senior
official
liu
bingjiang
told
reporters
last
month
that
local
governments
would
be
held
fully
accountable
for
any
failures
regardless
of
the
weather
most
of
the
cities
are
aiming
to
cut
pollution
by
percent
compared
to
months
earlier
far
lower
than
last
year
s
target
of
around
percent
the
compliance
period
also
began
a
month
earlier
in
october
when
pollution
is
normally
much
lower
however
they
are
still
struggling
to
meet
targets
with
four
months
of
the
period
passed
and
two
to
go
it
would
take
a
very
steep
reduction
in
to
get
to
the
reduction
target
