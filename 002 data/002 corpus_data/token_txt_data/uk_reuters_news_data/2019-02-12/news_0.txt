u.s. senate proposal would block saudi path to atomic weapon in nuclear deal
washington
reuters
senators
from
both
parties
introduced
a
resolution
on
tuesday
requiring
that
any
deal
to
share
nuclear
power
technology
with
saudi
arabia
block
the
kingdom
from
making
a
nuclear
weapon
under
the
measure
any
civilian
nuclear
cooperation
agreement
or
agreement
with
saudi
arabia
would
prevent
enrichment
of
uranium
or
reprocessing
of
plutonium
made
in
reactors
two
routes
to
making
nuclear
weapons
it
is
unclear
whether
a
majority
of
the
senate
would
support
the
resolution
of
democrats
jeff
merkley
and
ed
markey
and
republican
rand
paul
the
resolution
is
also
on
the
government
but
with
significant
support
it
would
signal
concern
in
congress
over
bombing
campaigns
in
yemen
and
over
the
killing
of
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
in
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
in
october
energy
secretary
rick
perry
has
been
holding
quiet
talks
with
officials
from
saudi
arabia
on
sharing
nuclear
technology
president
donald
trump
hosted
nuclear
power
executives
on
tuesday
for
talks
on
keeping
the
industry
competitive
on
exports
with
france
china
and
russia
the
trump
administration
is
trying
to
advance
nuclear
energy
technology
domestically
and
abroad
as
the
industry
suffers
from
plentiful
supplies
of
cheap
natural
gas
and
high
safety
costs
at
home
a
resolution
could
pressure
the
administration
to
push
for
a
deal
with
tougher
standards
if
saudi
arabia
is
going
to
get
its
hands
on
nuclear
technology
it
s
absolutely
critical
that
we
hold
it
to
the
gold
standard
for
merkley
said
in
a
release
the
last
thing
america
should
do
is
inadvertently
help
develop
nuclear
weapons
for
a
bad
actor
on
the
world
riyadh
has
said
it
wants
to
be
in
producing
nuclear
fuel
and
that
it
is
not
interested
in
diverting
nuclear
technology
to
military
use
but
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
told
cbs
last
year
the
kingdom
will
develop
nuclear
weapons
if
iran
does
in
previous
talks
saudi
arabia
has
refused
to
sign
an
agreement
with
washington
that
would
deprive
it
of
enriching
uranium
the
saudi
embassy
in
washington
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
last
year
saudi
arabia
put
the
united
states
on
a
shortlist
with
south
korea
s
utility
kepco
along
with
france
china
and
russia
to
bid
for
a
nuclear
power
project
the
winner
will
likely
be
selected
in
reactor
builder
westinghouse
owned
by
brookfield
asset
management
inc
would
likely
sell
nuclear
technology
to
saudi
arabia
in
any
deal

trump
was
supportive
in
tuesday
s
meeting
with
the
executives
but
wanted
them
to
clarify
their
expectations
