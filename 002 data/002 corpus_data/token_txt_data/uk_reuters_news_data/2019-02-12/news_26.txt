a
rebel
coalition
deby
has
faced
several
rebellions
since
seizing
power
in
in
a
military
coup
international
observers
have
questioned
the
fairness

last

deby
oversaw

the

a

djamena
this
intervention
was
totally
in
line
with
international
law
le
drian
said
the
incursion
which
chadian
troops
tried
to
halt
underscores
how
deby
s
fight
against
islamist
militants
in
the
region
has
stretched
his
military
the
military
effort
has
diverted
finances
away
from
public
services
and
the
economy
fuelling
popular
discontent
in
one
of
the
world
s
poorest
nations
