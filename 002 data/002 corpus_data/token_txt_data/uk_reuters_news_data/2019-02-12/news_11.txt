owner
of
the
largest
and
oldest
refinery
on
the
east
coast
is
facing
another
financial
crisis
just
months
after
emerging
from
a
controversial
bankruptcy
according
to
two
sources
and
a
reuters
review
of
court
filings
pes
which
exited
bankruptcy
in
august
saw
its
cash
balance
fall
to
million
at
the
end
of
down
from
million
just
three
months
earlier
a
million
decline
according
to
a
financial
report
filed
late
last
month
the
company
entered
bankruptcy
roughly
a
year
ago
with
million
cash
on
hand
court
documents
show
refineries
based
on
the
east
coast
suffer
from
difficult
economics
due
to
the
cost
of
shipping
crude
oil
from
west
texas
or
canada
but
pes
has
had
other
problems
at
the
plant
in
south
philadelphia
including
weak
gasoline
margins
and
high
debt
costs
the
company
filed
for
bankruptcy
in
january
blaming
its
woes
largely
on
the
costs
of
complying
with
the
renewable
fuel
standard
a
law
that
requires
refiners
to
either
blend
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
fuel
or
purchase
credits
called
rins
from
competitors
who
do
pes
does
not
have
those
blending
capabilities
so
it
has
to
pay
for
credits
but
a
reuters
analysis
showed
other
factors
played
a
role
in
the
bankruptcy
including
the
withdrawal
of
more
than
million
in
payments
from
the
company
by
its
investor
owners
after
filing
for
bankruptcy
the
company
was
given
a
waiver
for
half
of
its
million
in
liabilities
related
to
biofuels
credits
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
poor
gasoline
margins
have
hurt
the
company
s
bottom
line
as
well
pes
s
weak
cash
position
forced
the
refiner
to
significantly
scale
back
a
planned
million
maintenance
project
that
began
in
january
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with
the
plant
s
operations
refiners
perform
maintenance
to
keep
units
operating
reliably
and
safely
protecting
themselves
from
costly
unplanned
outages
i
am
not
surprised
that
they
are
economically
struggling
once
again
but
i
didn
t
expect
it
to
happen
so
soon

simeone
a
director
at
the
kleinman
center
for

policy
said
in
the
last
three
months
of
while
pes
saw
its
cash
balance
fall
by
million
the
compliance
credits
were
trading
at
lows

having
financial
difficulties

pretty

against
their

claims
that
the

is
the
primary
claim
in
filing
bankruptcy
said
simeone
who
authored
a
report
last
year
that
predicted
the
refinery
would
close
by
due
to
poor
economics

in
