state
mike
pompeo
cautioned
allies
on
monday
against
deploying
equipment
from
chinese
telecoms
giant
huawei
on
their
soil
saying
it
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
washington
to
partner
alongside
them
the
united
states
and
its
western
allies
believe
huawei
technologies
apparatus
could
be
used
for

and
see
its
expansion
into
central
europe
as
a
way
to
gain
a
foothold
in
the
eu
market
washington

concerned
in

about
the
expansion
of
huawei
the
world
s
biggest
maker
of
telecoms
equipment
in
hungary
and
poland

the
opportunities
and
the
risks
of
using
that
equipment
pompeo
told

hungary
is
the
first
stop
in
a
trip
by
pompeo
to
central
europe
that
also
includes
slovakia
and
poland
and
is
part
of
what
administration
officials
say
is
an
effort
to
make
up
for
a
lack
of
engagement
in
the
region
that
opened
the
door
to
more
chinese
and
russian
influence
huawei
denies
engaging
in
intelligence
work
for
any
government
it
says
its
technologies
serve
percent
of
hungarians
and
that
it
cooperates
with
most
telecoms
providers
in
hungary
including
enterprises
we
have
seen
this
all
around
the
world
it
also
makes
it
more
difficult
for
america
to
be
present
pompeo
told
reporters
during
a
stop
at
the
embassy
referring
to
huawei
equipment
if
that
equipment
is
where
we
have
important
american
systems
it
makes
it
more
difficult
for
us
to
partner
alongside
pompeo
announced
plans
for
a
defence
cooperation
agreement
with
hungary
one
of
the
european
governments
that
is
most
enthusiastic
about
chinese
investment
but
he
said
he
had
discussed
the
dangers
of
allowing
china
to
gain
a
bridgehead
in
hungary
in
talks
with
foreign
minister
peter
szijjarto
budapest
s
nationalist
government
like
poland
s
largely
isolated
politically
in
the
european
union
hopes
to
buy
air
defence
capabilities
from
the
united
states
in
poland
where
pompeo
is
travelling
on
tuesday
the
government
is
considering
banning
huawei
from
participating
in
the
development
of
capabilities
after
arresting
a
chinese
employee
of
huawei
and
a
former
polish
security
official
on
spying
allegations
last
month
both
men
have
denied
wrongdoing
it
is
also
lobbying
washington
for
an
increased
military
presence
on
its
soil
slovakia
which
pompeo
visits
before
poland
is
looking
to
buy
fighter
jets
pompeo
s
tour
includes
a
conference
on
the
middle
east
hosted
by
poland
where
washington
hopes
to
build
a
coalition
against
iran
he
is
also
expected
to
voice
concerns
about
energy
ties
with
moscow
and
urge
hungary
not
to
support
the
turkstream
pipeline
part
of
the
kremlin
s
plans
to
bypass
ukraine
the
main
transit
route
for
russian
gas
to
europe
hungary
gets
most
of
its
gas
from
russia
and
its
main
domestic
source
of
electricity
is
the
paks
nuclear
power
plant
where
russia
s
rosatom
is
involved
in
a
billion
expansion
hungary
s
szijjarto
brushed
off
concerns
over
russia
and
china
saying
budapest
was
fulfilling
its
obligations
to
western
allies
as
a
member
of
the
nato
military
alliance
when
it
comes
to
cooperation
with
russia
or
cooperation
with
the
people
s
republic
of
china
that
does
not
harm
us
being
reliable
as
a
nato
ally
he
told
a
joint
news
conference
with
his
counterpart
chinese
foreign
ministry
spokeswoman
hua
chunying
told
reporters
in
beijing
on
tuesday
that
china
appreciated
szijjarto
s
independent
fair
and
objective
comments
and
that
ties
would
not
be
damaged
or
interfered
with
by
other
countries
the
united
states
actions
to
suppress
chinese
companies
legitimate
development
interests
were
extremely
unfair
and
immoral
and
were
unbecoming
of
a
great
power
hua
said
pompeo
also
discussed
concerns
over
the
rule
of
law
in
hungary
where
prime
minister
viktor
orban
is
pressuring
courts
media
and
groups
earlier
in
the
day
pompeo
met
with
civil
society
leaders
at
the
embassy
and
said
he
would
discuss
their
treatment
directly
with
orban
so
many
of
the
concerns
that
are
voiced
are
things
that
have
happened
in
the
absence
of
america
being
engaged
he
told
reporters
szijjarto
drew
parallels
between
the
trump
administration
and
orban
government
on
curbing
immigration
protecting
christians
around
the
world
and
support
for
israel
hungary
s
government
and
president
donald
trump
s
administration
represent
an
identical
or
very
similar
approaches
in
both
general
political
and
numerous
international
political
issues
