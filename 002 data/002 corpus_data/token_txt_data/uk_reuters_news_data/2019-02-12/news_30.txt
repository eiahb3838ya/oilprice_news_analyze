update 2-opec cuts oil supply steeply but sees growing 2019 headwinds
london
reuters
opec
said
on
tuesday
it
had
cut
oil
production
steeply
under
a
global
supply
deal
although
it
flagged
headwinds
confronting
its
efforts
to
prevent
a
glut
this
year
including
weaker
demand
and
higher
rival
output
in
a
monthly
report
opec
said
its
oil
output
fell
almost
barrels
per
day
in
january
to
million
bpd
that
is
still
slightly
more
than
the
demand
opec
expects
for
its
crude
on
average
in
worried
by
a
drop
in
oil
prices
and
rising
supplies
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
allies
including
russia
agreed
in
december
to
make
supply
cuts
under
the
deal
opec
is
lowering
output
by
bpd
from
in
the
report
opec
cut
its
forecast
for
world
economic
growth
by
percentage
point
to
percent
and
highlighted
a
range
of
headwinds
such
as
a
slowdown
in
global
trade
some
recent
positive
developments
could
support
the
global
economy
at
its
current
level
including
the
recovery
in
oil
prices
possible
progress
in
trade
negotiations
and
monetary
tightening
by
the
federal
reserve
opec
said
in
the
report
nevertheless
this
would
not
lift
the
global
economy
beyond
the
growth
oil
extended
a
rally
on
tuesday
above
a
barrel
crude
has
risen
from
less
than
in
december
supported
by
the
saudi
opec
cuts
and
involuntary
declines
despite
concerns
about
slowing
demand
the
supply
cut
was
a
policy
after
the
producer
alliance
known
as
agreed
in
june
to
boost
supply
amid
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
lower
prices
and
cover
an
expected
shortfall
in
iranian
exports
opec
changed
course
after
prices
slid
from
a
barrel
in
october
making
the
producers
wary
of
a
new
glut
an
cut
from
january
had
got
rid
of
an
earlier
surplus
in
a
sign
of
excess
supply
opec
s
report
said
oil
inventories
in
developed
economies
were
above
the
average
in
december
the
biggest
drop
in
opec
supply
last
month
came
from
saudi
arabia
and
amounted
to
bpd
the
report
showed
with
the
supply
cut
delivered
in
january
the
opec
members
expected
to
cut
supply
under
the
deal
achieved
percent
compliance
according
to
a
reuters
calculation
a
high
rate
by
opec
s
past
standards
this
could
rise
in
coming
months
as
saudi
arabia
voluntarily
lowers
supply
by
more
than
it
agreed
saudi
arabia
plans
to
pump
around
million
bpd
in
march
more
than
bpd
below
its
target
under
the
deal
its
energy
minister
told
the
financial
times
and
further
declines
in
iran
libya
and
venezuela
exempt
from
the
supply
pact
could
give
a
tailwind
opec
said
in
the
report
that
demand
for
its
crude
would
decline
to
million
bpd
a
drop
of
bpd
from
its
last
report
as
rivals
such
as
the
united
states
boost
output
and
the
slowing
economy
limits
demand
this
implies
that
the
global
market
would
see
a
slight
surplus
of
about
bpd
in
should
opec
keep
pumping
at
january
s
rate
although
other
things
being
equal
the
saudi
plan
to
reduce
supply
further
will
offset
this
opec
forecast
global
oil
demand
would
grow
by
million
bpd
in
down
bpd
from
last
month
producers
will
boost
output
by
million
bpd
more
than
expected
previously
