world
shares
and
bond
yields
rode
a
renewed
surge
in
risk
appetite
on
tuesday
as
investors
were
optimistic
about
trade
talks
and
cheered
washington
s
deal
to
avoid
another
government
shutdown
tokyo
s
nikkei
set
the
tone
with
its
best
day
of
the
year
so
far
and
europe
wasted
little
time
in
trying
to
lift
the
stoxx
back
to
the
high
it
set
last
week
germany
s
dax
jumped
more
than
percent
after
rising
percent
on
monday
and
paris
and
milan
were
up
percent
while
london
s
ftse
approached
a
peak
despite
ongoing
brexit
uncertainty
the
dollar
hovered
at
a
high
and
the
australian
dollar
also
gained
the
yen
and
swiss
franc
dipped
while
treasury
and
german
bund
yields
edged
up
as
investors
jettisoned
safe
havens
we
have
had
two
bits
of
relatively
good
news
overnight
optimism
about
the
shutdown
not
resuming
and
optimism
about
a
trade
deal
said
societe
generale
strategist
kit
juckes
equities
are
higher
bond
yields
are
a
little
bit
higher
yen
and
swiss
franc
weakest
overnight
of
the
major
currencies
so
it
s
sort
of
rules
ok
juckes
said
he
reckoned
there
was
now
a
percent
chance
that
a
ratcheting
up
of
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
at
the
start
of
march
will
be
avoided
and
a
percent
chance
that
another
government
shutdown
will
be
dodged
those
odds
got
a
boost
on
monday
after
lawmakers
reached
a
tentative
deal
on
border
security
funding
though
aides
cautioned
that
it
did
not
contain
the
billion
president
donald
trump
wants
to
build
a
wall
on
the
mexican
border
s
p
futures
were
up
nearly
percent
pointing
to
a
solid
start
on
wall
street
later
after
a
choppy
day
on
monday
and
chinese
officials
expressed
hopes
the
new
round
of
talks
which
began
in
beijing
on
monday
would
bring
them
closer
to
easing
their
trade
war
beijing
and
washington
are
trying
to
hammer
out
a
deal
before
a
march
deadline
without
which
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
are
scheduled
to
increase
to
percent
from
percent
there
will
be
no
winner
in
a
trade
war
so
at
some
point
they
will
likely
strike
a
deal

firm
having
gained
for
eight
straight
sessions
against
a
basket
of
six
major

until
monday
its
longest
rally
in
two
years
although
the
federal
reserve
s
dovish
turn
dented
the
dollar
earlier
this
month
some
analysts
noted
the
currency
still
has
the
highest

among
major
peers
and
that

to
shrink

the
