beijing

chinese
buyers
of
ethanol
will
have
to
cut
their
imports
because
of
new
higher
tariffs
but
they
will
have
to
return
to
the
overseas
market
to
meet
the
government
s
targets
for
using
the
fuel
industry
participants
and
analysts
said
on
monday
china
said
late
on
sunday
it
will
slap
an
extra
percent
tariff
on
ethanol
imports
from
the
united
states
as
part
of
its
response
to
duties
on
aluminium
and
steel
imports
the
previous
duty
was
percent
the
tariffs
effective
monday
will
neutralize
the
cost
savings
from
importing
cheaper
ethanol
versus
domestic
supply
said
three
sources
that
participate
in
the
market
ethanol
is
an
alcohol
that
is
typically
produced
from
corn
or
sugar
and
often
mixed
with
gasoline
to
reduce
air
pollution
from
vehicle
emissions
the
price
difference
is
gone
we
will
suspend
imports
for
now
said
a
manager
at
a
private
oil
refinery
adding
that
he
was
considering
turning
to
domestic
suppliers
for
ethanol
to
blend
into
gasoline
that
is
good
news
for
domestic
producers
who
are
already
ramping
up
output
on
cheaper
corn
and
government
subsidies
we
have
so
much
corn
we
will
do
absolutely
fine
if
we
don
t
import
ethanol
said
a
manager
at
a
major
ethanol
producer
in
china
but
analysts
said
china
will
likely
have
to
resume
imports
soon
with
domestic
production
unlikely
to
meet
the
demand
for
ethanol
needed
to
meet
the
government
target
of
having
all
gasoline
nationwide
blended
with
percent
ethanol
by
demand
for
fuel
ethanol
will
potentially
explode
in
and
and
we
won
t
have
enough
domestic
supplies
by
then
we
might
have
to
turn
to
overseas
said
michael
mao
an
analyst
with
zhuochuang
a
commodities
consultancy
based
in
the
chinese
province
of
shandong
china
said
last
year
the
new
ethanol
mandate
would
boost
industrial
demand
for
corn
and
help
clean
up
its
choking
smog
it
would
mean
consumption
of
around
million
tonnes
of
ethanol
annually
made
from
million
tonnes
of
corn
according
to
reuters
calculations
china
s
current
ethanol
production
is
around
million
tonnes
a
year
it
is
not
clear
where
future
imports
will
come
from
a
percent
duty
on
ethanol
imports
previously
levied
since
january
had
already
slowed
a
trade
to
a
trickle
imports
had
recently
picked
up
after
prices
fell
enough
to
be
attractive
even
with
the
high
duties
but
the
new
tariffs
will
close
the
arbitrage
again
pushing
up
the
price
of
ethanol
to
around
yuan
per
tonne
after
taxes
on
par
with
domestic
prices
the
market
sources
said
prices
in
brazil
the
world
s
top
ethanol
producer
are
currently
too
high
for
exports
to
china
said
the
refinery
manager
but
they
could
be
an
option
in
future
