prices
of
renewable
fuel
credits
slumped
percent
in
the
first
three
months
of
their
biggest
quarterly
loss
in
a
year
on
uncertainty
over
the
future
of
biofuels
policy
this
has
been
the
second
straight
year
of
uncertainty
for
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
a
law
requiring
fuel
producers
to
blend
increasing
volumes
of
renewable
fuels
like
ethanol
with
counterparts
those
who
can
not
blend
these
fuels
are
required
to
purchase
credits
known
as
renewable
identification
numbers
rins
those
credits
once
cost
just
a
few
cents
but
the
price
has
risen
with
more
ambitious
requirements
for
biofuels
use
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
the
rfs
program
also
aimed
at
reducing
dependence
on
foreign
oil
and
boosting
rural
economies
has
expanded
the
market
for
fuels
but
independent
refiners
have
complained
as
the
price
of
the
credits
at
times
has
exceeded
each
philadelphia

solutions
declared
bankruptcy
this
year
citing
the
costs
though
reuters
also
reported
on
other
factors
president
donald
trump
held
several
meetings
at
the
white
house
trying
to
bridge
a
gap
between
big
oil
and
big
corn
sources
now
say
however
that
he
has
decided
to
leave
reform
to
congress
since
last
summer
it
s
been
one
big
raging
political
battle
in
about
changing
the
implementation
of
the
renewable
fuel
standard
said
scott
irwin
agricultural
economist
at
the
university
of
illinois
uncertainty
surrounding
the
program
along
with
the
pes
bankruptcy
pressured
prices
of
the
renewable
fuel
credits
they
fell
to
a
low
of
cents
apiece
in
according
to
data
from
the
oil
price
information
service
opis
from
a
high
of
cents
the
credits
closed
the
quarter
at
cents
senator
ted
cruz
a
texas
republican
has
suggested
a
cap
on
such
credits
while
biofuel
advocates
say
the
price
will
naturally
fall
as
consumption
increases
any
change
will
be
difficult
to
push
through
as
the
midterm
elections
approach
lawmakers
in
farm
states
and
those
from
states
with
large
energy
sectors
will
face
pressure
from
their
powerful
constituencies
irwin
said
prices
for
renewable
fuel
credits
may
rebound
in
the
short
term
then
drift
downward
in
one
to
three
years
refiners
are
not
convinced
the
law
is
working
in
no
other
market
that
i
know
of
do
you
see
such
wild
swings
such
volatility
said
brendan
williams
vice
president
of
pbf
energy
which
has
pushed
for
reform
or
repeal
of
the
program
we
re
hopeful
that
right
now
we
have
more
substantive
dialogue
at
a
higher
level
than
any
time
