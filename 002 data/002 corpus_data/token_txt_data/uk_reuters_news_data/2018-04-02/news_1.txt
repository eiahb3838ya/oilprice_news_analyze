update 4-u.s. epa to relax fuel efficiency standards for autos
washington
reuters
the
trump
administration
on
monday
rejected
an
plan
to
make
automobiles
more
fuel
efficient
opening
up
a
long
process
to
weaken
current
standards
and
putting
california
and
the
federal
government
on
a
collision
course
over
vehicle
emissions
scott
pruitt
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
said
in
a
statement
that
the
standards
on
model
year
to
vehicles
were
not
appropriate
and
should
be
revised
the
obama
administration
set
the
average
fuel
efficiency
standards
too
high
and
made
assumptions
about
the
standards
that
didn
t
comport
with
reality
pruitt
said
he
did
not
offer
specifics
on
revising
them
the
standards
called
for
roughly
doubling
by
the
average
fuel
efficiency
of
new
vehicles
sold
in
the
united
states
to
about
miles
km
per
gallon
proponents
said
they
could
help
spur
innovation
in
clean
technologies
california
has
long
been
allowed
by
an
epa
waiver
to
impose
stricter
standards
than
washington
does
on
vehicle
emissions
of
some
pollutants
and
other
states
including
new
york
pennsylvania
and
massachusetts
follow
california
s
lead
on
cleaner
cars
that
has
set
up
a
battle
on
vehicle
efficiency
between
california
the
most
populous
state
and
a
massive
car
market
and
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
pruitt
is
a
big
proponent
of
states
rights
to
regulate
themselves
but
opposes
california
s
push
for
greener
cars
california
s
waiver
to
impose
its
own
efficiency
standards
is
being
the
epa
said
it
is
in
america
s
best
interest
to
have
a
national
standard
pruitt
said
in
the
release
california
governor
jerry
brown
blasted
the
epa
s
action
this
cynical
and
meretricious
abuse
of
power
will
poison
our
air
and
jeopardize
the
health
of
all
americans
brown
said
mary
nichols
the
head
of
the
california
air
resources
board
said
her
state
will
vigorously
defend
the
existing
clean
vehicle
auto
industry
executives
have
not
publicly
sought
specific
reductions
in
the
requirements
negotiated
with
the
obama
administration
in
as
part
of
a
bailout
deal
but
they
have
urged
pruitt
and
trump
to
revise
the
obama
standards
so
it
becomes
easier
and
less
costly
to
meet
complex
targets
which
vary
depending
on
the
size
of
vehicles
and
whether
they
are
classified
as
cars
or
trucks
automakers
also
want
to
avoid
a
patchwork
of
rules
that
would
add
costs
to
engine
manufacturing
the
best
way
to
achieve
our
collective
goals
is
under
a
single
national
program
that
provides
an
aggressive
but
achievable
pathway
a
variety
of
compliance
tools
and
factors
in
the
role
of
customers
said
john
bozzella
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
association
of
global
automakers
gloria
bergquist
a
spokeswoman
for
the
alliance
of
automobile
manufacturers
said
pruitt
made
the
right
decision
and
that
the
administration
was
working
on
a
way
to
both
increase
fuel
economy
and
keep
new
vehicles
affordable
to
more
changes
to
the
standards
could
affect
car
manufacturers
including
ford
motor
co
general
motors
co
and
tesla
inc
auto
suppliers
were
cautiously
optimistic
about
the
creation
of
a
national
fuel
efficiency
plan
steve
handschuh
head
of
the
motor
and
equipment
manufacturers
association
said
while
his
group
supports
adjustments
and
flexibilities
we
do
not
support
significant
changes
to
the
environmentalists
decried
pruitt
s
decision
saying
stricter
standards
would
slash
emissions
of
the
greenhouse
gas
carbon
dioxide
proponents
of
the
corporate
average
fuel
economy
standards
or
cafe
say
they
have
led
to
big
gains
in
auto
technology
and
that
relaxing
them
could
eventually
hurt
sales
of
cars
in
european
and
asian
countries
that
are
moving
toward
mandates
for
electric
cars
it
would
take
america
backward
by
jeopardizing
successful
safeguards
that
are
working
to
clean
our
air
save
drivers
money
at
the
pump
and
drive
technological
innovation
that
creates
jobs
