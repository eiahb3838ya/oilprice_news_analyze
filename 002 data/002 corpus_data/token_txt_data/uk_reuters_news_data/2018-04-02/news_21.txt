analysis-latin american nations compete for capital in surge of oil auctions
houston
reuters
for
decades
many
latin
america
s
nations
have
often
shunned
investment
from
foreign
firms
instead
keeping
their
vast
reserves
under
the
tight
control
of
governments
and
oil
companies
they
aimed
to
protect
profits
to
feed
public
budgets
but
in
practice
have
seen
some
major
breakdowns
as
with
the
corruption
scandals
and
heavy
debts
at
brazil
s
petroleo
brasileiro
sa
or
the
inability
of
mexico
s
pemex
to
conjure
the
cash
and
expertise
to
tap
its
vast
deepwater
reserves
now
an
unprecedented
wave
of
energy
reforms
is
gaining
traction
across
the
region
setting
up
a
fierce
competition
to
attract
billions
of
dollars
in
investment
from
the
likes
of
exxon
mobil
bp
and
royal
dutch
shell
seven
governments
this
year
will
combine
to
hold
at
least
oil
and
gas
auctions
offering
a
record
blocks
of
onshore
or
offshore
acreage
according
to
interviews
with
officials
and
a
tally
of
announced
auctions
on
thursday
brazil
s
latest
auction
collected
billion
in
pledges
awarding
of
regions
on
offer
in
countries
in
the
region
will
host
the
most
licensing
rounds
in
history
said
pablo
medina
vice
president
of
energy
consultancy
welligence
for
a
graphic
on
latin
american
oil
auctions
see
the
race
for
private
investment
reflects
an
acknowledgment
by
many
countries
that
they
have
neither
the
cash
nor
the
technology
to
fully
explore
and
develop
their
reserves
the
embrace
of
foreign
capital
in
argentina
brazil
and
ecuador
also
follows
the
rise
of
centrist
or
governments
it
also
signals
a
willingness
by
governments
to
settle
for
a
smaller
cut
of
the
profits
which
could
be
slimmed
further
by
the
competition
to
attract
investment
as
governments
offer
tax
incentives
reduced
royalties
and
other
inducements
the
glaring
exception
is
venezuela
where
pdvsa
remains
under
the
firm
control
of
a
leftist
government
in
the
throes
of
an
economic
and
political
meltdown
elsewhere
emerging
reforms
are
giving
oil
majors
and
independent
producers
their
pick
of
some
of
the
region
s
richest
resources
after
being
shut
out
of
these
markets
or
waiting
years
for
the
right
moment
to
invest
but
they
also
face
a
risk
that
governments
could
shift
back
to
resource
nationalization
or
lose
the
political
will
to
fully
establish
market
reforms
an
oil
price
drop
could
also
undermine
profits
from
such
expensive
projects
we
love
this
continent
we
know
it
well
and
now
need
to
make
sure
we
will
spend
the
money
wisely
said
michel
hourcard
senior
vice
president
of
development
exploration
and
production
at
france
s
total
during
an
industry
conference
in
houston
last
month
the
regulatory
changes
in
latin
america
include
tax
breaks
reduced
royalties
longer
contracts
relaxed
qualification
terms
and
flexible
exploration
mandates
that
allow
companies
to
back
out
of
investments
more
easily
than
in
the
past
brazil
and
colombia
also
plan
to
set
up
permanent
offers
of
areas
for
exploration
and
production
similar
to
those
offered
by
the
united
states
rather
than
making
them
available
only
in
occasional
auctions
ecuador
is
offering
agreements
that
are
potentially
more
lucrative
for
oil
firms
than
contracts
that
prevented
companies
from
benefiting
from
oil
price
gains
countries
have
to
present
terms
attractive
enough
to
draw
bidders
back
to
the
region
said
julie
wilson
research
director
of
global
exploration
at
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
strong
participation
by
oil
majors
in
recent
auctions
of
exploration
and
production
rights
in
mexico
and
brazil
have
heralded
a
new
era
by
attracting
about
billion
in
investment
pledges
brazil
started
its
effort
to
lure
outside
capital
two
decades
ago
but
it
fell
flat
after
initially
enticing
more
than
companies
said
decio
oddone
head
of
brazil
s
oil
regulator
the
effort
was
stymied
by
too
few
areas
offered
for
auction
the
low
quality
of
some
projects
and
the
dominant
role
of
petrobras
many
of
those
companies
did
not
have
the
expected
success
oddone
said
now
brazil
is
relaxing
bidding
rules
to
encourage
local
firms
and
foreign
explorers
to
participate
joining
majors
already
established
in
its
vast
region
in
mexico
political
risks
hampered
its
most
recent
auction
in
march
where
bidding
was
dominated
by
pemex
the
in
a
presidential
election
set
for
july
has
promised
to
scrutinize
the
nation
s
energy
reforms
but
some
industry
leaders
believe
the
country
will
stay
on
the
path
of
opening
everything
from
exploration
to
refining
and
gasoline
retailing
there
is
a
very
clear
strategy
said
jeremy
weir
chief
executive
of
trading
firm
trafigura
broad
participation
by
european
and
asian
firms
in
several
auctions
is
another
a
sign
a
mexican
revival
is
underway
added
fatih
birol
president
of
the
international
energy
agency
a
group
representing
most
of
the
world
s
top
oil
consuming
nations
some
of
mexico
s
and
brazil
s
efforts
are
being
copied
argentina
is
allowing
oil
companies
to
recommend
specific
areas
for
they
would
like
to
see
auctioned
as
mexico
did
in
past
rounds
colombia
will
open
a
permanent
offer
of
areas
as
brazil
plans
to
do
and
mexico
plans
to
replicate
brazil
s
auction
calendar
giving
firms
more
time
to
plan
capital
spending
before
bidding
rounds
some
countries
are
keenly
aware
of
the
need
to
adjust
its
policies
to
compete
with
other
nations
according
to
juan
carlos
zepeda
head
of
the
nation
s
energy
regulator
national
hydrocarbons
commission
cnh
we
are
flexible
enough
to
accommodate
any
of
our
neighbors
creativity
he
said
higher
risk
higher
reward
compared
with
brazil
and
mexico
argentina
and
uruguay
this
year
hope
to
catch
investors
with
offers
that
hold
greater
exploration
risk
but
potentially
higher
rewards
argentina
officials
believe
brazil
s
formation
could
extend
to
areas
off
its
atlantic
coast
and
in
july
will
release
terms
of
its
first
offshore
auction
that
is
a
big
change
in
a
nation
that
just
six
year
ago
expropriated
spanish
oil
firm
repsol
s
stake
in
ypf
unlike
the
rounds
for
argentina
s
vast
vaca
muerta
shale
formation
which
were
led
locally
by
provincial
governments
the
nation
s
central
government
will
run
this
year
s
auctions
standardizing
rules
and
offering
better
terms
uruguay
which
holds
a
third
offshore
auction
in
april
is
putting
up
blocks
for
exploration
and
production
after
relaxing
the
qualification
terms
and
reducing
the
scope
of
its
mandatory
exploration
programs
smaller
latin
american
countries
including
guyana
suriname
and
paraguay
are
in
talks
with
oil
companies
to
offer
rights
to
oilfields
or
to
find
partners
for
their
oil
firms
similar
energy
market
openings
have
blossomed
in
the
past
only
to
fade
as
governments
reverted
to
resource
nationalization
or
imposed
limits
to
foreign
investment
latin
america
has
in
prior
decades
between
opening
to
private
investment
and
returning
to
oil
nationalism
it
s
part
of
the
cycle
the
countries
tend
to
ask
oil
companies
for
as
much
as
they
can
said
horacio
cuenca
wood
mackenzie
s
director
of
upstream
research
for
latin
america
they
only
lower
costs
and
royalties
when
available
capital
starts
drying
