the

is
part
of
erdogan
s
vision
marking
years
since
the
founding
of
modern
turkey
and
is
intended
to
reduce
turkey
s
dependence
on

however
since

was
awarded
the
contract
in
the
project
has
been
beset
by
delays
last
month

with
the
matter
said
akkuyu
was
likely
to
miss
its
target
date
but
rosatom
which
is
looking
for
local
partners
to
take
a
percent
stake

committed
to
the
timetable

cited
the
head
of
rosatom
saying
that
the
sale
of
the
percent
stake
was
likely
to
be
postponed
from
this
year
until
turkish
companies
have
been
put
off
by
the
size
of
the
financing
required
as
well
as
by
concerns
they
will
not
receive
a
sufficient
share
of
the
lucrative
construction
side
of
the
deal
two
industry
sources
have
said
putin
will
make
a
