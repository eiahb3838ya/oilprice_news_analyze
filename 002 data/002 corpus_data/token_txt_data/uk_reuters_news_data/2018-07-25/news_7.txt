qatar to build sugar refinery to avoid boycott disruptions - sources
reuters
qatar
is
building
a
sugar
refinery
in
a
bid
to
avoid
supply
disruptions
after
neighboring
gulf
arab
states
severed
economic
and
political
ties
with
doha
more
than
a
year
ago
sources
say
in
normal
trading
conditions
building
a
refinery
in
qatar
would
make
little
commercial
sense
because
of
depressed
sugar
prices
surplus
world
stocks
and
the
presence
of
regional
refineries
that
could
provide
supplies
the
sources
said
but
they
said
qatar
with
its
huge
financial
resources
generated
from
gas
exports
and
as
host
of
the
world
cup
wanted
to
avoid
any
shortfall
for
the
desert
nation
that
depends
heavily
on
imports
to
feed
its
million
population
saudi
arabia
the
united
arab
emirates
bahrain
and
egypt
severed
ties
with
qatar
in
june
accusing
it
of
fomenting
regional
unrest
supporting
terrorism
and
getting
too
close
to
iran
doha
denies
all
the
accusations
this
will
strengthen
our
independence
and
by
god
s
will
help
break
restrictions
imposed
on
our
economy
now
more
than
ever
we
must
be
able
to
support
ourselves
a
senior
economy
ministry
official
told
reuters
he
said
the
refinery
would
be
near
hamad
port
km
miles
south
of
doha
and
would
start
up
by
the
end
of
or
early
the
official
declined
to
provide
further
details
two
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
initiative
said
the
new
refinery
would
have
capacity
to
produce
tonnes
of
sugar
a
year
exceeding
annual
consumption
estimated
at
tonnes
the
sources
did
not
give
a
value
for
the
project
a
presentation
by
the
transport
and
communications
ministry
showed
the
planned
plant
would
refine
tonnes
of
sugar
a
day
saying
operations
were
expected
to
start
by
qatar
previously
relied
on
imports
of
white
sugar
from
the
uae
and
saudi
arabia
once
the
boycott
started
qatar
turned
to
supplies
from
india
and
other
producers
food
prices
rose
after
the
boycott
with
saudi
arabia
cutting
off
imports
by
closing
qatar
s
only
land
border
a
middle
east
based
trade
source
said
the
project
did
not
make
economic
sense
based
on
the
investment
needed
to
adapt
hamad
port
and
the
cost
of
packaging
which
would
need
to
be
imported
another
regional
trade
source
said
the
refinery
was
likely
to
bring
in
raw
sugar
from
brazil
to
be
refined
into
white
sugar
this
has
to
be
viewed
as
a
strategic
project
for
qatar
