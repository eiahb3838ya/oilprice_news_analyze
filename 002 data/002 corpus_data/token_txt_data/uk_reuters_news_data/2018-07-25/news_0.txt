from
a
mile
away
the
roof
of
mihingoni
primary
school
glitters
in
kenya
s
midday
sun
the
effect
though
comes
not
from
the
roof
but
from
what
is
on
it
a
sparkling
array
of
solar
panels
mihingoni
is
one
of
eight
mostly
primary
schools
in
the
southeastern
coastal
county
of
kilifi
that
have
been
fitted
with
a
solar
array
the
key
task
of
the
panels
is
to
power
tablet
computers
that
pupils
use
under
the
government
s
strategy
to
integrate
into
primary
education
last
year
more
than
million
of
the
devices
were
distributed
to
primary
school
students
across
the
country
among
them
mihingoni
s
pupils
but
tablets
require
electricity
which
many
rural
schools
lack
mihingoni
primary
is
connected
to
the
national
grid
but
power
is
expensive
and
only
its
computer
room
has
electricity
limiting
charging
of
the
devices
but
since
the
solar
panels
were
fitted
in
january
pupils
can
have
access
to
their
tablets
any
time
and
the
cost
of
power
has
considerably
gone
down
said
kuchanja
karisa
headmaster
of
the
school
about
kilometres
miles
north
of
the
coastal
city
of
mombasa
in
his
impoverished
area
he
said
access
to
electricity
boosts
access
to
education
not
least
because
the
cost
of
power
is
factored
into
school
fees
poverty
levels
in
this
area
are
high
and
any
slight
increase
or
decrease
in
school
fees
affects
school
attendance
he
said
the
panels
are
part
of
a
project
run
by
two
organisations
to
provide
solar
power
to
primary
schools
and
clinics
in
remote
communities
the
ovo
foundation
the
charitable
arm
of
a
energy
firm
provides
funding
while
energy
impact
a
charity
that
works
on
accelerating
access
to
energy
does
the
installation
the
need
is
great
thousands
of
kenyan
schools
lack
access
to
the
national
power
grid
figures
from
the
education
ministry
show
the
country
had
primary
schools
as
of
of
which
nearly
were
state
schools
as
of
last
december
about
primary
schools
were
connected
to
the
grid
according
to
simon
gicharu
who
chairs
the
government
s
rural
electrification
program
a
lack
of
power
at
unconnected
schools
however
makes
it
difficult
for
students
to
take
full
advantage
of
tablets
provided
under
the
programme
karisa
said
at
mihingoni
for
example
pupils
unable
to
access
the
computer
lab
to
charge
their
tablets
which
have
an
battery
life
ended
up
using
them
less
the
headmaster
said
at
the
school
students
previously
paid
kenyan
shillings
a
year
for
electricity
but
today
with
the
solar
panels
there
is
a
much
lower
fee
shillings
which
goes
to
pay
for
more
grid
power
in
the
rainy
season
when
the
solar
panels
work
less
effectively
cutting
costs
has
seen
a
sharp
increase
in
the
number
of
students
who
have
since
joined
the
school
karisa
said
in
the
school
had
about
pupils
in
each
class
he
said
now
it
has
with
the
lower
cost
encouraging
more
parents
to
send
their
children
to
school
annual
fees
at
the
school
are
about
shillings
per
primary
school
student
apart
from
the
energy
supplement
every
coin
counts
for
area
locals
karisa
said
fifty
kilometres
north
is
migodomani
primary
school
which
also
had
solar
panels
installed
in
january
headmaster
ngala
kahindi
luwali
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
that
until
the
panels
were
available
his
pupils
had
been
unable
to
use
tablets
at
all
with
the
solar
panels
we
have
been
able
to
catch
up
with
other
schools
in
urban
areas
that
have
already
incorporated
he
said
pupils
are
enthusiastic
with
since
it
s
a
new
method
of
the
panels
power
not
only
the
tablets
but
projectors
and
a
television
none
of
which
the
school
previously
had
been
able
to
use
the
array
also
provides
lighting
to
the
school
s
boarding
facilities
where
students
once
relied
on
costly
and
polluting
paraffin
lanterns
gaby
sethi
who
heads
the
ovo
foundation
said
she
believes
providing
access
to
clean
electricity
in
parts
of
the
world
without
power
can
help
people
get
ahead
we
think
we
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
people
and
children
s
lives
if
we
re
electrifying
schools
and
health
clinics
she
said
under
the
project
the
panels
and
installation
are
free
with
the
schools
paying
for
ongoing
maintenance
costs
karisa
said
gabriel
katana
the
county
s
head
of
education
and
information
and
communications
technology
said
the
local
government
wants
to
see
solar
panels
installed
to
power
hospitals
and
other
social
amenities
too
in
the
future
we
will
purchase
solar
pumps
to
use
in
irrigating
food
to
be
grown
in
the
schools
to
feed
the
pupils
he
said
the
ambition
is
to
use
solar
power
for
all
of
the
county
s
primary
school
needs
not
just
powering
information
technology
he
said
relying
on
solar
panels
has
some
drawbacks
however
including
that
they
can
be
less
effective
in
rainy
and
cold
seasons
said
mihingoni
primary
school
s
karisa
at
those
times
the
school
has
to
revert
back
to
using
kerosene
for
lighting
and
grid
power
for
electricity
he
said
daniel
kuria
who
manages
energy
impact
s
solar
programme
in
kenya
agreed
there
is
a
need
for
a
solar
array
that
generates
sufficient
power
in
the
rainy
season
mihingoni
primary
will
get
an
improved
battery
system
to
store
solar
power
and
help
bridge
the
gap
he
said
for
now
the
solar
panels
and
lower
school
fees
as
a
result
are
helping
keep
students
in
school
karisa
said
parents
can
use
the
flimsiest
of
excuses
to
keep
their
children
home
so
it
important
to
have
cheap
reliable
energy
like
solar
that
will
not
expense
the
parents
