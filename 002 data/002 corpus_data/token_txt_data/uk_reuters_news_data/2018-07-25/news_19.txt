china
national
petroleum
corp
cnpc
said
on
wednesday
it
will
spend
more
than
billion
yuan
billion
by
to
boost
oil
and
gas
production
in
the
western
region
of
xinjiang
aiming
to
offset
falling
output
from
ageing
fields
in
northeast
china
the
increased
spending
will
push
output
in
the
xinjiang
autonomous
region
to
more
than
million
tonnes
of
oil
equivalent
between
and
cnpc
said
the
investment
is
equivalent
to
the
total
expenditure
by
cnpc
s
listed
unit
petrochina
china
s
top
oil
and
gas
producer
for
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
production
in
cnpc
s
xinjiang
operations
churned
out
million
tonnes
of
crude
oil
last
year
while
the
company
produced
billion
cubic
metres
of
gas
equivalent
to
million
tonnes
of
gas
from
the
tarim
in
the
region
one
of
china
s
largest
gas
basins
according
to
petrochina
s
annual
report
based
on
these
figures
the
new
investment
would
boost
output
from
the
region
by
at
least
percent
by
the
spending
spree
underscores
the
need
to
replace
output
from
the
daqing
oilfield
in
the
northeastern
province
of
heilongjiang
as
well
as
a
push
to
increase
the
country
s
natural
gas
output
to
meet
growing
demand
for
the
fuel
as
part
of
beijing
s
shift
away
from
coal
beijing
also
wants
to
increase
development
in
the
unruly
xinjiang
region
which
borders
central
asia
where
hundreds
have
died
in
ethnic
unrest
in
recent
years
i
think
that
the
primary
factor
is
to
support
the
central
government
policy
to
invest
more
and
support
economic
development
in
the
west
said
liutong
zhang
director
at
hong
waterrock
energy
economics
a
portion
of
the
money
would
be
spent
on
the
logistics
storage
tanks
and
also
downstream
gas
infrastructure
for
the
southern
part
of
xinjiang
to
use
natural
gas
for
environmental
the
boost
is
unlikely
to
affect
import
demand
from
the
world
s
top
crude
importer
because
new
output
will
replace
lost
capacity
elsewhere
still
it
reflects
the
company
s
growing
confidence
after
a
surge
this
year
in
the
price
of
crude
oil
state
oil
majors
have
also
grabbed
a
bigger
share
of
the
lucrative
fuel
export
market
as
smaller
independent
refiners
struggle
with
tough
new
taxes
and
an
environmental
crackdown
sinopec
is
expected
to
