update 2-edf's flamanville reactor start again delayed to 2020
paris
reuters
problems
with
weldings
have
forced
french
utility
edf
to
delay
the
date
for
its
troubled
flamanville
nuclear
reactor
to
the
second
quarter
of
and
pushed
its
cost
estimate
up
to
three
times
the
original
budget
when
construction
started
in
the
target
launch
date
was
but
the
project
has
suffered
a
string
of
serious
technical
problems
including
the
discovery
of
weak
spots
in
its
reactor
vessel
cover
and
has
been
delayed
several
times
the
cost
estimate
is
now
up
by
another
million
euros
to
billion
euros
billion
edf
said
in
a
statement
it
said
that
loading
of
the
nuclear
fuel
last
set
for
the
fourth
quarter
of
was
now
scheduled
for
the
fourth
quarter
of
on
a
call
with
reporters
flamanville
project
director
laurent
thieffry
said
that
repairs
to
the
weldings
would
start
at
the
end
of
this
month
and
continue
till
summer
he
added
that
the
reactor
would
be
connected
to
the
grid
in
the
first
quarter
of
and
its
commercial
start
at
full
power
was
now
scheduled
for
the
second
quarter
of
the
new
planning
for
the
epr
reactor
in
flamanville
is
totally
realistic
edf
head
of
new
nuclear
projects
xavier
ursat
said
but
he
added
that
the
startup
schedule
would
depend
on
the
of
nuclear
regulator
asn
edf
said
the
million
euro
extra
cost
consisted
of
to
million
euros
in
cost
directly
related
to
the
welding
repairs
with
the
rest
due
to
the
impact
of
the
delay
on
the
entire
project
edf
shares
were
down
percent
in
early
trading
on
a
virtually
flat
french
bourse
the
utility
said
a
total
of
weldings
on
the
reactor
s
secondary
circuit
would
have
to
be
redone
while
for
another
it
is
confident
that
it
can
convince
regulator
asn
that
they
are
fit
for
service
another
weldings
were
in
line
with
specifications
and
needed
no
repairs
it
said
the
secondary
circuit
consists
of
meters
of
cm
diameter
piping
that
conducts
steam
from
the
reactor
s
four
steam
generators
to
the
plant
s
turbine
and
pumps
condensed
water
back
to
the
steam
generators
four
to
five
centimeters
thick
the
pipes
require
welding
that
needs
to
go
around
each
pipe
times
and
takes
eight
weeks
per
welding
edf
said
the
million
euro
extra
cost
consisted
of
to
million
euros
directly
related
to
the
welding
repairs
with
the
rest
due
to
the
impact
of
the
delay
on
the
entire
project
edf
said
it
would
closely
supervise
and
control
the
welding
work
on
the
reactor
itself
a
parliament
report
about
nuclear
security
released
this
month
said
that
excessive
reliance
on
outsourcing
was
causing
safety
issues
in
edf
s
reactors
france
relies
on
nuclear
energy
for
percent
of
its
electricity
the
epr
reactor
is
the
first
new
reactor
to
be
built
on
its
soil
in
decades
the
french
government
wants
to
reduce
the
country
s
reliance
on
nuclear
to
percent
and
will
decide
later
this
year
by
when
this
target
should
be
reached
