laos
one
of
the
world
s
few
remaining
communist
states
and
one
of
asia
s
poorest
countries
has
ambitions
to
become
the
battery
of
asia
through
the
construction
of
multiple
dams
its
government
depends
almost
entirely
on
outside
developers
to
build
the
dams
under
commercial
concessions
that
involve
the
export
of
electricity
to
more
developed
neighbors
including
thailand
rights
groups
have
repeatedly
warned
against
the
human
and
environmental
cost
of
the
dam
drive
including
damage
to
the
already
fragile
ecosystem
of
the
region
s
rivers
attapeu
is
a
largely
agricultural
province
that
borders
vietnam
to
the
east
and
cambodia
to
the
south
the
dam
that
collapsed
was
part
of
the
billion
power
project
which
involves
laotian
thai
and
south
korean
firms
known
as
saddle
dam
d
it
was
part
of
a
network
of
two
main
dams
and
five
subsidiary
dams
the
project
s
main
partner
south
korea
s
sk
engineering
construction
said
part
of
a
small
supply
dam
was
washed
away
and
the
company
was
cooperating
with
the
laos
government
to
help
rescue
villagers
the
firm
blamed
the
collapse
on
heavy
rain
laos
and
its
neighbors
are
in
the
middle
of
the
monsoon
season
that
brings
tropical
storms
and
heavy
rain
lao
state

also
posted
images
of
flash
flooding
with
buildings
and
roads
under

further
north
in
khammouane
province
an
official
at
sk
engineering
construction
said
fractures
were
discovered
on
the
dam
on
sunday
and
the
company
ordered
the
evacuation
of
villages
as
soon
the
danger
became
clear

laos
expert
baird
said
the
collapse
of
the
subsidiary
dam
was
unlikely
to
affect
others
in
the
project
the
water
s
all
out
of
the
reservoir
now
and
the
water
levels
are
already
going
down
but
i
don
t
think
they
ll
be
able
to
fix
it
until
the
dry

said
hydropower
dams
