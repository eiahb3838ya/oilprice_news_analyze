joanna
edghill
spins
around
the
car
park
before
plugging
the
vehicle
into
a
charging
point
beneath
rows
of
solar
panels
converting
caribbean
rays
into
power
for
the
grid
in
the
five
years
since
she
and
her
husband
started
their
company
megapower
it
has
sold
electric
vehicles
and
set
up
charging
stations
plus
a
handful
of
solar
on
the
km
island
of
barbados
they
are
now
expanding
elsewhere
in
the
caribbean
the
main
factor
with
islands
is
we
don
t
have
range
anxiety
i
can
develop
and
roll
out
a
charging
network
in
barbados
where
customers
are
never
more
than
a
few
kilometres
from
a
charging
point
said
edghill
who
previously
worked
in
international
development
we
have
at
least
days
of
pure
sunlight
every
year
so
why
not
take
advantage
of
the
resources
that
we
do
have
here
burdened
by
a
costly
dependence
on
imported
fuel
for
energy
barbados
and
many
other
caribbean
islands
are
considering
boosting
the
number
of
electric
vehicles
on
their
roads
but
they
face
barriers
including
high
initial
costs
stiff
import
duties
on
electric
vehicles
and
a
lack
of
regulatory
support
say
people
working
in
the
sector
globally
the
number
of
electric
vehicles
topped
million
in
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
iea
which
predicts
there
will
be
million
in
use
by
that
figure
could
go
as
high
as
million
if
action
to
meet
global
climate
targets
and
other
sustainability
goals
becomes
more
ambitious
says
the
iea
more
research
policies
and
incentives
are
needed
to
drive
further
uptake
it
notes
in
barbados
the
island
s
electricity
utility
government
departments
and
private
firms
are
among
the
customers
buying
the
electric
cars
and
delivery
vans
megapower
imports
from
britain
said
edghill
it
has
also
built
solar
which
power
charging
points
for
the
barbados
arm
of
courier
giant
dhl
and
the
government
of
vincent
and
the
grenadines
megapower
s
other
solar
panels
feed
into
the
grid
offsetting
the
equivalent
of
the
power
used
by
electric
cars
the
caribbean
is
ripe
for
the
electrification
of
transportation
said
curtis
boodoo
assistant
professor
at
the
university
of
trinidad
and
tobago
who
also
works
on
electric
vehicles
with
the
caricom
regional
group
of
countries
if
you
invest
in
electric
vehicles
you
are
able
to
use
your
existing
electrical
infrastructure
and
save
the
costs
of
the
transportation
fuel
that
you
have
to
pumping
fuel
into
electricity
generation
is
two
to
three
times
more
efficient
than
putting
it
directly
into
car
engines
he
said
meaning
more
electric
vehicles
on
the
roads
could
help
shave
the
region
s
hefty
bills
for
many
caribbean
countries
over
half
the
amount
of
fuel
they
import
is
used
for
transport
barbados
spent
million
last
year
on
fuel
imports
government
data
shows
crippled
with
public
debt
and
dogged
by
rising
oil
prices
the
island
s
new
government
wants
to
make
its
bus
network
electric
and
eventually
switch
all
government
transport
too
boodoo
said
increased
state
investment
in
electric
buses
would
help
upgrade
transport
systems
while
cutting
emissions
and
paving
the
way
for
consumers
to
follow
vehicles
could
also
on
a
push
to
inject
more
power
into
the
grid
from
renewables
like
solar
wind
and
hydro
said
devon
gardner
caricom
s
energy
programme
manager
costs
are
high
however
and
on
some
islands
import
duties
for
electric
vehicles
are
higher
than
on
cars
trinidad
and
tobago
has
scrapped
taxes
and
import
duties
for
most
electric
cars
but
taxes
elsewhere
can
add
up
to
percent
depending
on
the
model
high
purchase
prices
mean
vehicles
remain
unaffordable
for
most
caribbean
drivers
a
nissan
leaf
electric
car
for
example
costs
about
in
barbados
compared
with
in
britain
heavily
indebted
caribbean
countries
are
torn
between
collecting
revenue
from
car
imports
and
supporting
the
of
private
electric
vehicles
said
gardner
the
caribbean
doesn
t
have
the
luxury
of
using
some
of
the
levers
of
incentives
that
were
used
by
the
richer
more
developed
countries
he
said
nonetheless
power
utilities
in
the
bahamas
turks
and
caicos
and
lucia
are
starting
to
install
charging
networks
which
could
help
the
sector
expand
said
megapower
s
edghill
privately
owned
utilities
want
people
buying
electricity
so
every
person
that
is
plugging
in
is
a
person
not
buying
gas
or
diesel
but
buying
their
product
she
said
battery
john
felder
who
founded
cayman
automotive
plans
to
open
an
office
soon
in
havana
and
anticipates
a
healthy
market
in
cuba
for
electric
bikes
and
scooters
which
start
at
low
import
duties
on
electric
vehicles
in
cuba
make
them
cheaper
to
buy
said
felder
he
has
sold
about
electric
cars
in
the
cayman
islands
which
has
cut
import
duties
and
installed
charging
stations
he
wants
to
convert
to
solar
the
is
very
fragile
there
are
no
freeways
where
you
can
go
miles
per
hour
for
hundreds
of
miles
he
said
electric
vehicles
are
perfect
for
the
while
battery
technology
is
making
electric
cars
more
attractive
globally
on
caribbean
islands
emerging
technology
could
use
power
stored
in
batteries
to
keep
the
lights
on
if
disaster
strikes
power
stored
in
one
electric
bus
could
provide
energy
for
up
to
homes
for
a
day
or
power
shelters
and
community
centres
if
overhead
electricity
cables
are
knocked
out
said
boodoo
driving
down
prices
might
be
key
to
an
electric
car
revolution
but
some
bet
islands
will
gradually
wake
up
to
the
benefits
vehicles
can
bring
by
improving
public
transport
and
taming
expensive
diesel
habits
i
like
to
say
that
within
five
years
percent
of
the
barbados
population
will
be
driving
electric
vehicles
i
think
that
realistic
