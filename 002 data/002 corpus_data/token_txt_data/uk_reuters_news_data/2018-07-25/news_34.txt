update 2-u.s. epa to keep pursuing biofuel changes under new leadership -wheeler
washington
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
s
acting
administrator
said
on
tuesday
he
would
follow
up
the
work
of
his
predecessor
to
overhaul
the
nation
s
biofuel
policy
including
pursuing
changes
strongly
opposed
by
the
powerful
corn
lobby
like
counting
ethanol
exports
toward
annual
biofuels
quotas
the
biofuel
industry
had
been
hoping
that
andrew
wheeler
would
drop
some
of
former
administrator
scott
pruitt
s
overhaul
efforts
which
were
aimed
at
helping
the
oil
industry
and
instead
prioritize
the
interests
of
farmers
in
the
heartland
to
expand
domestic
markets
for
fuel
wheeler
said
the
agency
was
open
to
changes
sought
by
the
biofuel
industry
but
only
if
it
made
concessions
too
when
everyone
is
complaining
about
the
program
we
need
to
look
at
ways
to
change
the
program
he
said
the
comments
at
a
briefing
with
reporters
were
among
the
first
by
wheeler
on
such
policy
issues
since
pruitt
resigned
as
epa
administrator
earlier
this
month
in
the
face
of
ethics
controversies
efforts
to
bring
the
rival
corn
and
oil
groups
together
around
an
overhaul
to
the
renewable
fuel
standard
failed
under
pruitt
but
wheeler
said
his
decades
of
experience
in
washington
could
make
a
difference
the
rfs
requires
refiners
to
blend
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
fuel
supply
each
year
or
purchase
blending
credits
from
those
that
do
the
policy
has
helped
farmers
by
creating
a
market
for
ethanol
but
has
rankled
some
refining
companies
that
say
it
costs
them
a
fortune
wheeler
also
said
the
agency
wanted
a
solution
to
the
nation
s
vehicle
emissions
standards
as
the
epa
opens
the
door
to
weakening
efficiency
targets
over
the
objections
of
california
president
donald
trump
s
administration
is
expected
as
early
as
thursday
to
propose
revoking
california
s
power
to
set
state
vehicle
emissions
rules
setting
up
what
is
likely
to
be
a
protracted
legal
battle
between
the
state
and
washington
we
don
t
want
to
see
two
different
standards
for
the
country
wheeler
said
wheeler
said
he
met
last
week
with
mary
nichols
the
head
of
california
air
resource
board
and
shared
the
administration
s
opinion
standards
set
under
former
president
barack
obama
called
for
roughly
doubling
by
the
average
fuel
efficiency
of
new
vehicles
sold
in
the
united
states
to
about
miles
km
per
gallon
something
the
trump
administration
has
called
too
onerous
for
the
auto
industry
but
which
proponents
said
could
help
spur
innovation
in
clean
technologies
on
biofuels
wheeler
said
the
agency
would
keep
pursuing
changes
to
the
renewable
fuel
standard
that
pruitt
sought
including
counting
ethanol
exports
toward
the
nation
s
annual
biofuels
blending
quotas
such
a
move
would
reduce
costs
for
the
refining
industry
by
effectively
lowering
the
domestic
biofuel
blending
quota
and
anger
the
corn
lobby
by
undermining
demand
he
added
that
the
agency
could
also
look
at
changes
that
would
help
the
biofuel
industry
like
expanding
the
sale
of
gasoline
blends
and
by
requiring
some
refiners
to
blend
more
ethanol
to
compensate
for
volumes
lost
under
an
epa
waiver
program
for
small
refiners
reallocating
the
volumes
would
be
a
concession
to
the
corn
industry
which
has
said
the
waiver
program
undermines
demand
for
ethanol
but
wheeler
said
any
of
those
changes
would
need
to
come
as
a
package
deal
and
would
not
be
adopted
piecemeal
under
the
rfs
refineries
up
to
barrels
per
day
can
seek
exemptions
from
the
law
each
year
if
they
can
prove
compliance
would
cause
them
financial
hardship
the
epa
issued
data
this
month
that
said
it
granted
such
waivers
for
the
years
and
representing
some
billion
gallons
of
biofuels
significantly
higher
than
under
obama
the
surge
in
waivers
has
caused
the
cost
of
compliance
credits
to
plummet
saving
refiners
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
wheeler
said
the
lower
credit
costs
should
lead
to
fewer
exemptions
in
the
future
if
credits
cause
a
hardship
it
would
only
make
sense
the
lower
credit
costs
reduce
the
hardship
