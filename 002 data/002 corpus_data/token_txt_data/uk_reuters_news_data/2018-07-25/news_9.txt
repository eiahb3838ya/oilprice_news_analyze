solar
panels
and
smart
batteries
could
help
cut
electricity
bills
by
almost
half
for
people
on
the
isles
of
scilly
a
british
energy
storage
provider
said
as
it
launched
a
renewable
energy
programme
on
the
group
of
cornish
islands
the
smart
energy
islands
project
aims
to
slash
emissions
improve
the
power
supply
and
lower
costs
for
residents
of
five
inhabited
islands
km
miles
off
england
s
southwest
coast
energy
firm
moixa
said
the
isles
of
scilly
aim
to
generate
percent
of
their
energy
from
renewable
sources
and
make
percent
of
vehicles
driven
there
electric
or
by
a
undersea
cable
is
now
the
only
connection
between
the
isles
of
scilly
and
the
uk
s
national
grid
last
year
islanders
had
to
rely
on
diesel
generators
for
almost
two
weeks
after
the
cable
was
damaged
by
a
fishing
boat
the
isles
dependence
on
imported
fuel
has
left
many
families
with
unreliable
heating
systems
and
expensive
bills
electricity
costs
per
household
are
about
percent
higher
than
in
cornwall
according
to
moixa
of
the
islands
residents
about
percent
can
not
afford
to
heat
their
homes
compared
to
roughly
percent
across
england
a
government
report
said
this
year
the
project
costing
million
pounds
million
and
partly
financed
by
the
european
regional
development
fund
will
install
solar
panels
on
more
than
council
houses
as
well
as
smart
water
heaters
and
smart
batteries
in
homes
and
businesses
the
islands
will
cut
carbon
emissions
by
nearly
tonnes
per
year
once
the
solar
panels
are
operating
according
to
moixa
the
combined
technologies
due
to
be
installed
by
this
autumn
will
provide
islanders
with
a
reliable
electricity
supply
and
could
reduce
their
bills
by
as
much
as
percent
said
chris
wright
moixa
s
chief
technology
officer
the
smart
batteries
put
in
by
the
company
will
store
surplus
power
and
release
it
when
demand
peaks
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
system
delivers
flexibility
and
manages
the
load
on
the
grid
he
said
the
project
led
by
hitachi
europe
ltd
offers
a
blueprint
for
other
small
islands
and
cities
across
europe
wright
noted
the
isles
of
scilly
are
a
small
community
but
can
be
seen
as
a
prototype
city
he
said
the
project
is
a
precursor
for
what
energy
systems
might
look
like
in
a
few
years
time
