the

told
reuters
by

the
southeast
asian
country
one
of
the
world
s
few
remaining
communist
states
has
an
ambitious
scheme
in
order
to
become
the
battery
of
asia
its
government
depends
almost
entirely
on
outside
developers
to
build
its
planned
portfolio
of
dams
under
commercial
concessions
that
agree
to
export
electricity
to
its
more
developed
neighbours
including
thailand
environment
rights
groups
have
repeatedly
warned
about
the
human
and
environmental
cost
of
the
rapid
pace
of
dam
construction
including
damage
to
the
ecosystem
of
the
region
s
rivers
attapeu
is
a
largely
agricultural
province
that
borders
vietnam
to
the
east
and
cambodia
to
the
south
the
dam
that
collapsed
is
part
of
the
hydroelectric
power
project
which
involves
laotian
thai
and
south
korean
firms
the
subsidiary
dam
known
as
saddle
dam
d
was
part
of
a
network
of
two
main
dams
and
five
subsidiary
dams
south
korea

sk
engineering
construction
said
part
of
a
small
supply
dam
was
washed
away
and
the
company
was
cooperating
with
the
laos
government
to
help
rescue
villagers
near
the
site
an
official
at
the
firm
said
fractures
were
first
discovered
on
the
dam
on
sunday
and
that
the
company
had
ordered
the
evacuation
of
villages
as
soon
as
it
became
clear
the
dam
could
collapse
brian
eyler
director
of
the
stimson
center
s
southeast
asia
programme
said
a
breach
of
a
saddle
dam
could
be
worse
in
terms
of
devastation
than
that
of
a
main
dam
with
a
saddle
dam
breaking
it
s
flushing
water
into
an
area
that
s
not
used
to
having
water
inside
it
and
it
will
continue
to
breach
until
the
water
can
be
diverted
again
which
is
one
option
or
until
the
reservoir
is
drawn
down
to
a
level
below
the
breach
eyler
told
reuters
this
is
yet
another
major
shock
to
laos
plan
to
become
the
battery
of
southeast
asia
he
said
tholakhong
a
lao
language
news
site
said
on
tuesday
water
levels
at
the
gauge
in
one
of
the
affected
villages
showed
