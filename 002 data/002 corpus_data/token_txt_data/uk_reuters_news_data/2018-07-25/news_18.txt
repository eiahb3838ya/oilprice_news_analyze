update 1-tullow to use cash pile to invest, reduce debt, not dividends
london
reuters
tullow
oil
will
use
free
cashflow
of
million
million
pounds
to
pay
down
debt
and
invest
rather
than
pay
an
interim
dividend
it
said
on
wednesday
after
having
raised
the
possibility
of
a
return
to
payouts
tullow
returned
to
profit
last
year
after
three
years
in
the
red
and
chief
financial
officer
les
wood
in
april
indicated
that
the
company
could
start
to
pay
dividends
again
the
board
considered
carefully
whether
to
pay
an
interim
dividend
but
concluded
that
for
the
moment
free
cash
flow
is
best
used
to
continue
to
pay
down
debt
and
to
invest
in
assets
tullow
said
in
a
statement
wood
said
on
wednesday
the
company
did
not
need
to
reach
its
general
net
debt
target
of
billion
in
order
to
reinstate
payouts
adding
both
dividends
and
share
buybacks
had
their
merits
tullow
s
net
debt
of
billion
was
slightly
below
expectations
for
the
first
half
the
company
had
said
it
expected
free
cashflow
to
come
in
at
around
million
for
the
first
six
months
of
the
year
on
wednesday
it
said
it
could
potentially
generate
around
million
in
free
cashflow
for
the
full
year
but
this
could
be
impacted
by
litigation
costs
a
london
judge
ordered
tullow
this
month
to
pay
seadrill
around
million
saying
tullow
was
wrong
to
end
a
contract
between
the
companies
on
the
grounds
of
force
majeure
over
a
maritime
border
dispute
in
west
africa
tullow
had
originally
said
its
partners
would
pay
in
keeping
with
their
stakes
in
the
project
but
kosmos
which
owns
around
percent
successfully
challenged
this
the
focus
of
the
tullow
investment
case
should
now
be
on
moving
developments
forward
to
convert
resources
into
reserves
and
more
frequent
exploration
activity
barclays
said
in
a
note
shareholder
returns
can
also
play
a
role
emphasizing
that
a
measured
in
activity
does
not
equate
to
a
loss
of
capital
tullow
plans
to
drill
an
exploration
well
in
namibia
in
september
and
expand
drilling
in
ghana
into
next
year
it
aims
for
final
investment
decisions
on
uganda
towards
the
end
of
this
year
and
kenya
in
late
which
would
open
up
those
countries
oil
industries
for
exports
in
kenya
however
tullow
has
stopped
a
pilot
scheme
producing
oil
and
trucking
around
barrels
a
day
to
the
coast
due
to
security
issues
around
cattle
rustling
and
banditry
chief
executive
paul
mcdade
said
he
said
he
did
not
expect
this
to
change
the
overall
timeframe
for
the
project
