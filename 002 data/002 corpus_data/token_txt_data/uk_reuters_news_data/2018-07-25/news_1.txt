a
stocks
rally
was
threatening
to
stall
on
wednesday
as
markets
waited
for
a
meeting
between
president
donald
trump
and
european
commission
chief
jean
to
see
where
the
global
trade
war
was
heading
next
a
flurry
of
disappointing
earnings
including
from
boeing
and
general
motors
was
set
to
tug
wall
street
off
a
high
too
as
profit
taking
on
tech
stocks
and
miners
sapped
focus
had
also
returned
to
what
may
happen
with
tariffs
after
eu
trade
commissioner
cecilia
malmstrom
told
a
swedish
newspaper
on
wednesday
that
the
bloc
was
preparing
billion
of
levies
on
goods
if
washington
imposes
them
on
imported
cars
a
monthly
survey
of
german
business
confidence
also
showed
some
impact
from
the
row
although
there
was
no
major
plunge
and
with
china
s
yuan
having
held
up
overnight
too
traders
in
most
markets
seemed
content
to
keep
their
positions
steady
we
have
seen
a
lot
of
complacency
over
this
entire
trade
war
so
the
question
is
unless
we
see
a
very
negative
outcome
from
the
meeting
are
we
going
to
see
a
marked
reaction
rabobank
strategist
bas
van
geffen
said
it
is
an
odd
one
where
two
key
trade
partners
but
also
two
key
allies
are
now
fighting
each
with
another
blizzard
of
multinational
corporate
earnings
a
european
central
bank
meeting
and
gdp
figures
still
to
come
this
week
there
was
plenty
of
scope
for
volatility
car
giant
general
motors
fell
percent
in
trading
after
the
automaker
cut
its
earnings
forecast
citing
rising
steel
and
aluminum
costs
due
to
tariffs
air
conditioner
maker
said
tariffs
would
hurt
its
margins
while
indian
polaris
industries
said
it
would
have
to
absorb
additional
tariff
and
related
commodity
cost
increases
too
the
dollar
index
which
measures
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
six
other
major
currencies
was
just
off
a
low
at
and
fractionally
lower
at
against
the
euro
and
yen
the
yield
on
the
treasury
note
which
tends
to
act
as
the
benchmark
for
global
borrowing
costs
eased
to
percent
as
well
after
climbing
to
a
peak
of
percent
overnight
bond
yields
have
been
pushed
up
this
week
on
speculation
the
bank
of
japan
is
edging
closer
to
unwinding
its
aggressive
stimulus
programme
but
with
thursday
s
ecb
meeting
looming
most
bond
yields
in
the
euro
area
also
edged
down
on
wednesday
britain
s
pound
nudged
up
to
after
uk
prime
minister
theresa
may
had
said
on
tuesday
that
she
would
now
lead
negotiations
on
the
country
s
departure
from
the
european
union
turkey
s
lira
also
clawed
higher
having
sunk
more
than
percent
on
tuesday
after
its
central
bank
shied
away
from
raising
rates
in
what
was
seen
as
another
hit
to
its
shredded
credibility
state
street
global
advisors
currency
portfolio
manager
aaron
hurd
said
the
worry
is
that
president
tayyip
erdogan
s
government
will
put
pressure
on
the
central
bank
to
keep
rates
down
fuelling
what
is
already
inflation
the
new
finance
minister
and
the
new
cabinet
in
total
is
an
unknown
quantity
and
we
have
to
wait
and
see
and
learn
how
to
interpret
their
behaviours
hurd
said
that
means
an
even
higher
risk
premium
priced
into
the
the
decline
in
china
s
yuan
paused
for
the
time
being
also
the
currency
was
a
shade
firmer
at
per
dollar
having
hit
a
low
of
this
week
on
signs
that
beijing
is
grabbing
for
the
stimulus
levers

though

msci

those
moves
came
after
wall

s

closed
at
its
highest
level
since
the
start
of
february
as
