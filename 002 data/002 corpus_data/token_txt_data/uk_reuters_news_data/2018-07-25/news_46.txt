new u.s. russia sanctions push slows in congress before recess
washington
reuters
republicans
who
control
the
congress
are
hesitating
to
advance
tough
new
russia
sanctions
legislation
as
fears
of
damage
to
american
companies
slow
efforts
to
quickly
send
moscow
a
message
against
meddling
in
the
next
election
unlike
a
year
ago
when
congress
worked
with
lightning
speed
on
a
sanctions
law
targeting
russia
north
korea
and
iran
some
lawmakers
said
on
tuesday
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
were
carefully
weighing
their
response
to
growing
fears
that
moscow
is
plotting
to
interfere
in
november
s
congressional
elections
republicans
and
democrats
were
united
in
their
repudiation
last
week
of
president
donald
trump
s
failure
to
publicly
condemn
russian
president
vladimir
putin
for
interfering
in
the
presidential
election
despite
findings
by
intelligence
russia
has
denied
such
meddling
occurred
with
a
summer
recess
set
to
begin
in
the
house
on
friday
and
the
senate
taking
an
early
august
recess
backers
of
legislation
to
impose
harsh
new
sanctions
on
russia
feared
the
effort
could
be
losing
steam
a
bipartisan
group
of
senators
led
by
republican
senator
marco
rubio
and
democratic
senator
chris
van
hollen
is
pushing
deter
act
legislation
putting
putin
on
notice
that
his
country
would
be
slammed
with
a
torrent
of
sanctions
if
russia
interfered
in
any
future
american
election
it
had
the
backing
of
several
senior
lawmakers
although
it
was
unclear
how
quickly
it
could
move
through
committees
that
proposal
is
one
that
i
think
is
generating
a
good
amount
of
interest
and
i
think
it
s
a
pretty
solid
approach
really
said
no
senate
republican
john
thune
but
leading
congressional
republicans
and
energy
firms
concerned
about
losing
business
with
russia
have
been
seeking
to
put
on
the
brakes
congressional
sources
said
last
week
that
oil
and
gas
firms
were
lobbying
against
the
tighter
sanctions
that
could
affect
their
investments
in
russia
we
don
t
want
to
rush
in
with
our
hair
on
fire
senate
foreign
relations
committee
chairman
bob
corker
told
reporters
on
tuesday
adding
that
a
new
sanctions
bill
had
to
be
done
in
a
thoughtful
senate
democratic
leader
chuck
schumer
declared
on
monday
that
new
russia
sanctions
legislation
was
stuck
in
the
mud
as
he
accused
republicans
of
being
unwilling
maybe
afraid
to
push
back
against
trump
despite
a
possible
loss
of
momentum
on
sanctions
republican
leadership
had
tough
words
for
putin
on
tuesday
house
speaker
paul
ryan
and
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
both
republicans
separately
proclaimed
that
putin
would
not
be
welcome
in
the
capitol
if
he
accepted
trump
s
invitation
to
visit
washington
this
autumn
last
week
ryan
called
russia
s
government
menacing
as
he
urged
a
new
round
of
sanctions
but
so
far
the
only
firm
action
by
congress
since
helsinki
is
a
move
to
loosen
not
tighten
the
noose
on
russia
the
trump
administration
has
convinced
a
group
of
lawmakers
to
ease
a
sanctions
regime
aimed
at
moscow
that
has
made
it
difficult
for
allies
such
as
india
indonesia
and
vietnam
to
purchase
weapons
from
russia
the
legislation
deep
inside
a
massive
bill
authorizing
military
programs
still
has
to
be
approved
by
the
full
house
and
senate
but
democratic
senator
chris
coons
predicted
that
the
deter
bill
would
garner
overwhelming
support
if
brought
to
the
senate
floor
the
sanctions
law
last
year
passed
whatever
the
president
s
concerns
are
i
think
he
would
ultimately
sign
it
he
can
do
math
