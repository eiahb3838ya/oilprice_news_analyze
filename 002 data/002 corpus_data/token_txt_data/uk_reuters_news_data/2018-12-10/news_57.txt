graphic-take five: uk may-day and us curveballs: world markets themes for the week ahead
reuters
following
are
five
big
themes
likely
to
dominate
thinking
of
investors
and
traders
in
the
coming
week
and
the
reuters
stories
related
to
them
with
major
parts
of
the
economy
visibly
slowing
the
treasury
market
has
reacted
in
a
striking
manner
the
yield
is
close
to
falling
below
the
yield
which
would
mark
the
curve
inversion
that
has
preceded
every
recession
in
the
last
years
signs
of
slowdown
have
persuaded
markets
to
bet
the
fed
will
slow
the
pace
of
rate
increases
next
year
but
wait
inflation
is
running
at
a
high
annual
wage
growth
a
year
high
and
unemployment
at
a
year
low
so
november
inflation
due
on
will
play
into
how
fed
chair
jerome
powell
frames
the
path
of
future
tightening
so
it
remains
to
be
seen
where
the
curve
goes
from
here
there
are
reasons
to
believe
it
can
steepen
and
reasons
to
believe
it
will
invert
depending
on
how
the
incoming
data
looks
stagflation
anyone
the
fed
s
view
on
where
neutral
is
and
what
its
policy
response
should
be
in
the
coming
months
is
far
from
clear

buckle
up
for
another
wild
week
of
brexit
on
sterling
and
other
markets
britain
s
parliament
is
at
the
time
of
writing
at
least
set
to
vote
on
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
brexit
transition
deal
on
tuesday
but
the
chances
of
it
being
approved
don
t
look
good
what
happens
then
is
well
that
s
the
thing
there
are
multiple
possibilities
all
with
very
different
implications
a
really
heavy
defeat
would
make
it
difficult
for
may
to
carry
on
she
has
staggered
through
the
last
couple
of
years
taking
direct
hits
from
all
angles
but
this
could
finally
bring
her
down
could
that
then
lead
to
a
hard
brexiteer
taking
the
reins
and
ripping
up
the
deal
perhaps
and
sterling
won
t
like
that
one
bit
but
it
s
equally
possible
that
whoever
takes
over
would
press
pause
on
the
whole
process
by
withdrawing
the
article
notice
that
could
even
raise
the
chances
of
a
second
public
brexit
vote
and
that
could
send
sterling
soaring

thursday
marks
the
end
of
an
era
for
the
ecb
which
is
set
to
formally
announce
the
end
of
its
long
monetary
stimulus
scheme
for
markets
that
s
a
done
deal
what
matters
now
is
what
the
ecb
does
in
the
face
of
a
weakening
economy
global
trade
tensions
brexit
and
italy
policymakers
have
already
been
floating
ideas
to
support
the
economy
when
qe
ends
one
suggestion
is
for
loans
to
banks
what
investors
appear
more
certain
about
is
that
the
ecb
will
struggle
to
bring
interest
rates
back
up
to
zero
percent
especially
if
a
slowdown
encourages
the
fed
to
pause
its
cycle
money
market
pricing
suggests
investors
expect
roughly
a
pct
chance
of
a
ecb
rate
hike
in
but
that
s
down
from
percent

a
few
weeks

so
much
for
the
trade
truce
if
financial
markets
are
any
guide
the
detente
between
washington
and
beijing
struck
over
a
steak
dinner
at
the
in
buenos
aires
barely
lasted
hours
fears
of
global
trade
war
and
economic
slowdown
are
again
driving
investor
sentiment
on
oil
markets
that
signals
that
a
percent
price
slump
since
october
has
little
hope
of
reversing
oil
has
also
had
to
contend
with
opec
whose
initial
failure
to
agree
an
output
cut
accelerated
the
price
slump
agreement
over
a
million
cuts
together
with
some
producers
has
provided
a
bit
of
respite
but
brent
still
remains
just
over
commodities
overall
are
in
some
trouble
copper
is
near
lows
having
lost
around
percent
so
far
in
while
most
base
metals
are
down
a
similar
amount
and
the
australian
dollar
a
good
proxy
for
commodities
chinese
demand
and
world
trade
was
the
major
currency
in
the
world
all
week
without
good
news
on
the
trade
front
respite
is
unlikely
the
trade
deficit
hit
a
high
in
october
and
its
politically
sensitive
deficit
with
china
surged
to
a
record
billion
so
lets
see
how
china
hawks
in
the
trump
administration
react
to
data
showing
beijing
s
imports
from
the
united
states
shrank
percent
from
a
year
earlier
following
a
percent
annual
decline
in
october
it
appears
so
far
that
china
may
not
be
carrying
out
promises
to
import
more
from
america
and
that
could
provide
more
grist
for
the
mill
for
officials
pushing
for
more
reasons
to
punish
china
and
for
investors
skeptical
of
the
trade
ceasefire
the
prospect
of
a
chinese
growth
slowdown
is
keeping
investors
edgy
so
while
trade
contributes
far
less
to
the
country
s
gdp
than
it
used
to
there
are
other
data
points
coming
up
too
credit
growth
and
retail
sales
among
others
which
should
show
how
badly
the
economy
is
hurting
from
the
trade
war
