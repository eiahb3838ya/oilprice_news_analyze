reuters
south
korean
prosecutors
have
charged
four
people
with
illegally
importing
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
north
korean
coal
in
violation
of
international
sanctions
by
trying
to
disguise
it
as
imports
from
russia
a
prosecutors
office
said
on
monday
south
korea
s
customs
agency
found
in
august
that
some
firms
had
imported
coal
from
north
korea
in
violation
of
resolutions
aimed
at
choking
off
funding
for
its
nuclear
and
ballistic
missile
programmes
the
unidentified
defendants
were
charged
on
friday
with
bringing
in
north
korean
coal
and
other
material
by
laundering
the
origin
through
fake
certificates
of
origin
from
russian
ports
after
the
old
route
for
north
korean
coal
through
china
was
blocked
due
to
sanctions
the
daegu
district
public
prosecutors
office
said
in
a
statement
it
appears
that
the
defendants
wanted
profit
from
arbitrage
using
the
fact
that
the
prices
of
north
korean
coal
and
other
materials
are
low
due
to
their
difficulty
to
be
traded
internationally
the
office
said
one
of
the
four
a
woman
was
arrested
for
bringing
in
some
tonnes
of
coal
and
tonnes
of
pig
iron
from
north
korea
worth
about
billion
won
million
and
billion
won
respectively
between
the
office
said
south
korea
s
exchange
and
cooperation
act
prohibits
the
import
of
north
korean
products
without
special
approval
from
the
minister
of
unification
the
woman
was
also
charged
with
violating
customs
law
by
bringing
in
some
tonnes
of
coal
briquettes
from
north
korea
worth
about
million
won
by
falsifying
customs
records
to
say
they
were
semi
coke
the
office
said
the
other
three
people
who
are
indicted
without
arrest
were
found
to
have
brought
in
or
abetted
the
import
of
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
north
korean
coal
pig
iron
and
or
coal
briquettes
during
that
time
the
office
said
the
security
council
banned
north
korea
s
sale
of
coal
iron
iron
ore
lead
lead
ore
and
seafood
in
august
last
year
in
a
bid
to
cut
by
a
third
its
billion
annual
export
income
it
also
capped
north
korea
s
import
of
crude
oil
and
refined
petroleum
products
in
september
the
united
states
has
led
the
sanctions
campaign
to
press
north
korea
to
give
up
its
nuclear
and
missile
programmes
but
there
have
been
signs
that
the
campaign
for
maximum
pressure
has
lost
steam
since
north
korea
sought
to
improve
relations
with
south
korea
china
and
the
united
states
president
donald
trump
met
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
for
an
unprecedented
summit
in
singapore
in
june
to
discuss
north
korea
s
denuclearisation
and
the
easing
sanctions
trump
said
this
month
he
expected
to
met
kim
again
in
january
or
february
won
