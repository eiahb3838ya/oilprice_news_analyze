the
key
concept
in
the
wake
of
the
decision
to
reduce
crude
oil
output
by
opec
and
its
allies
is
balance
it
s
something
everybody
in
the
market
says
they
want
but
they
all
have
different
ideas
of
what
it
means
and
how
to
get
there
boiled
down
to
the
basics
both
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
the
other
producers
most
notably
russia
are
trying
to
do
with
the
move
to
cut
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
is
achieve
their
vision
of
a
balanced
market
while
what
this
means
is
not
exactly
spelled
out
in
unambiguous
terms
it
s
assumed
to
mean
that
they
want
an
oil
price
they
believe
to
be
fair
and
one
that
will
allow
them
to
meet
their
fiscal
obligations
as
well
as
ensuring
sufficient
incentive
for
capital
spending
to
maintain
future
output
what
this
means
for
the
price
of
crude
oil
is
less
than
certain
although
it
s
likely
that
opec
and
its
allies
will
take
the
view
that
the
a
barrel
that
brent
crude
closed
at
the
day
before
the
output
deal
was
reached
is
too
low
but
it
s
also
apparent
that
in
the
current
climate
an
oil
price
above
a
barrel
will
result
in
fairly
rapid
demand
destruction
and
rising
output
from
producers
outside
the
opec
orbit
brent
reached
a
high
of
a
barrel
on
but
a
mere
eight
weeks
later
it
had
shed
almost
percent
of
its
value
hitting
a
trough
of
on
the
lowest
level
in
a
year
it
s
that
rapid
plunge
that
led
opec
and
its
allies
to
conclude
that
the
market
was
no
longer
in
balance
and
that
output
needed
to
be
cut
to
return
to
the
desired
but
elusive
state
the
market
will
now
get
to
deliver
its
verdict
on
whether
opec
has
once
again
baked
a
magic
pudding
that
will
allow
crude
prices
to
rise
but
not
so
high
that
demand
is
threatened
the
initial
price
action
after
the
announcement
of
the
deal
was
mildly
positive
for
opec
with
brent
jumping
as
much
as
to
a
barrel
during
trade
on
but
eventually
it
closed
at
up
percent
from
the
previous
day
the
nirvana
of
balance
also
means
that
opec
and
in
particular
its
largest
producer
and
de
facto
leader
saudi
arabia
have
to
walk
a
series
of
political
tightropes
the
obvious
one
is
also
the
most
public
president
donald
trump
who
is
often
criticised
for
changing
his
mind
on
issues
but
has
been
remarkably
consistent
on
one
front
namely
his
desire
for
lower
oil
prices
it
s
perhaps
no
surprise
that
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
singled
out
energy
companies
as
winners
from
the
opec
and
allies
deal
telling
reporters
at
the
meeting
in
vienna
on
that
they
were
breathing
a
sigh
of
relief
this
was
perhaps
a
attempt
to
stave
off
a
blast
from
trump
on
his
favoured
social
media
platform
twitter
by
reminding
him
that
the
powerful
energy
lobby
is
no
friend
of
his
push
for
ever
lower
oil
prices
the
saudis
also
have
to
manage
their
relationship
with
the
united
states
carefully
in
the
wake
of
the
murder
of
saudi
dissident
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
the
kingdom
s
consulate
in
october
trump
has
said
he
is
not
convinced
the
saudi
crown
prince
ordered
the
murder
even
as
leaders
of
his
own
republican
party
make
noises
about
imposing
stiff
sanctions
on
saudi
arabia
for
the
killing
a
further
complicating
factor
is
iran
which
is
exempt
from
the
new
deal
and
in
theory
living
on
borrowed
time
given
the
waivers
on
its
oil
exports
are
due
to
expire
on
april
given
the
plethora
of
competing
factors
and
influences
it
would
seem
balance
will
be
a
difficult
if
not
impossible
task
in
the
crude
oil
market
but
how
will
the
success
of
this
latest
production
cut
be
measured
if
crude
remains
in
a
range
between
and
a
barrel
in
the
run
up
to
the
expiry
of
the
iran
export
waivers
then
it
might
be
fair
to
argue
that
opec
and
its
allies
will
have
achieved
what
they
wanted
a
floor
and
a
ceiling
that
everybody
can
live
with
the
opinions
expressed
here
are
