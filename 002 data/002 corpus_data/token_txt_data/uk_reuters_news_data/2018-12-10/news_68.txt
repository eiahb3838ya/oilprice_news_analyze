petronet
lng
is
looking
to
sign
a
deal
in
a
year
s
time
to
buy
at
least
million
tonnes
of
natural
gas
annually
for
a
period
of
up
to
years
as
it
pushes
to
diversify
its
supply
sources
beyond
the
middle
east
as
part
of
any
deal
the
firm
could
potentially
take
a
stake
in
a
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
project
said
petronet
s
managing
director
prabhat
singh
the
market
is
open
compared
to
other
markets
where
the
state
is
often
the
controller
of
minerals
singh
told
reuters
late
last
week
the
offers
lots
of
opportunities
and
we
would
like
to
explore
that
properly
and
make
a
venture
there
he
said
petronet
currently
runs
a
million
tonnes
per
annum
mtpa
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
regasification
site
at
dahej
in
the
western
state
of
gujarat
and
a
mtpa
plant
at
kochi
in
southern
india
it
has
deals
to
buy
mtpa
of
lng
with
mtpa
of
that
coming
from
qatar
s
rasgas
singh
said
petronet
was
in
talks
with
various
companies
including
tellurian
inc
about
a
potential
deal
singh
had
said
in
november
that
petronet
and
ongc
videsh
were
jointly
in
talks
to
buy
a
stake
in
tellurian
s
proposed
driftwood
project
in
louisiana
if
the
pricing
is
right
then
india
has
appetite
for
huge
volumes
he
said
last
week
natural
gas
accounts
for
about
percent
of
india
s
overall
energy
needs
far
lower
than
the
global
average
the
government
wants
to
lift
that
to
percent
in
the
next
few
years
the
market
is
so
developed
that
niche
service
providers
are
available
on
a
shoestring
budget
which
means
less
overheads
singh
said
a
glut
of
natural
gas
in
the
united
states
in
the
wake
of
the
rapid
development
of
shale
fields
there
has
kept
benchmark
prices
for
lng
at
almost
half
asian
levels
meanwhile
singh
said
petronet
was
also
in
talks
to
invest
in
exploration
and
lng
projects
in
qatar
as
well
as
continuing
to
scout
for
opportunities
in
bangladesh
and
sri
lanka
australia
overtook
qatar
as
the
world
s
largest
exporter
of
lng
for
the
first
time

november
