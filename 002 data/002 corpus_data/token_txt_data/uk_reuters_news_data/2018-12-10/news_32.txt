the

make
further
cuts

bolster

macron
addresses
the
nation
on
monday
evening
the
president
has
drawn
criticism
for
his
silence
in
public
over
the
violence
in
paris
opponents
accuse
him
of
turning
the
elysee
palace
into
a
bunker
ministers
hope
he
will
placate
the
yellow
vests
whose
revolt
poses
the
most
formidable
challenge
to
his
administration
to
date
our
country
is
deeply
divided
between
those
who
see
that
globalisation
has
benefited
them
and
others
who
can
t
make
ends
meet
who
say
globalisation
is
not
an
opportunity
but
a
threat
le
maire
told
rtl
it
is
the
president
s
role
to
unify
the
the
protests
were
born
out
of
a
backlash
against
the
squeeze
on
the
household
budgets
of
middle
class
and
workers
but
the
movement
has
developed
into
a
broader
rebellion
the
former
investment
banker
is
under
pressure
to
respond
to
the
demands
of
yellow
vests
for
a
higher
minimum
wage
lower
taxes
and
better
retirement
provisions
though
more
concessions
will
leave
france
in
danger
of
breaching
eu
deficit
rules
the
big
picture
is
that
the
budget
deficit
will
worsen
and
political
problems
will
make
cuts
to
spending
hard
said
rabobank
rates
strategist
lyn
the
government
s
latest
estimates
are
for
a
budget
deficit
of
percent
in
just
below
the
eu
s
percent
cap
a
target
macron
has
cast
as
critical
to
meet
to
cement
his
reformist
credentials
le
maire
reiterated
his
desire
to
accelerate
tax
cuts
but
suggested
he
was
not
in
favour
of
reinstating
a
tax
on
wealth
known
as
the
isf
that
macron
narrowed
when
he
came
into
office
and
which
earned
him
the
tag
president
of
the
rich
does
the
isf
help
reduce
poverty
reduce
our
debts
reduce
public
spending
