russia gas pipeline to boost grip on ukraine, europe -u.s. diplomat
washington
reuters
russia
is
seeking
to
boost
its
power
in
europe
and
grip
over
ukraine
with
the
proposed
nord
stream
natural
gas
pipeline
the
top
energy
diplomat
said
on
monday
in
a
of
washington
s
rhetoric
against
the
pipeline
through
nord
stream
russia
seeks
to
increase
its
leverage
of
the
west
while
severing
ukraine
from
europe
francis
fannon
the
assistant
secretary
for
energy
resources
at
the
state
department
told
reporters
in
a
teleconference
the
pipeline
has
been
opposed
both
by
president
donald
trump
a
republican
and
his
democratic
predecessor
barack
obama
as
a
political
tool
for
russia
to
consolidate
power
over
europe
much
of
the
gas
that
europe
currently
gets
from
russia
via
pipeline
goes
through
ukraine
which
collects
billions
of
dollars
in
transit
charges
making
up
to
percent
of
its
gross
domestic
product
if
nord
stream
which
aims
to
bring
russian
gas
to
western
europe
via
the
baltic
sea
and
turkstream
a
pipeline
to
bring
gas
from
russia
to
turkey
are
completed
it
would
mean
transit
revenues
would
evaporate
it
s
kind
of
just
what
s
left
over
that
would
be
transited
potentially
transited
through
ukraine
fannon
said
even
then
that
s
only
based
on
whether
we
can
trust
russia
president
vladimir
putin
i
don
t
think
the
record
should
indicate
anyone
putin
has
said
that
nord
stream
a
consortium
of
russia
s
gazprom
and
five
european
companies
is
purely
economic
and
not
directed
against
other
countries
russian
gas
could
continue
to
go
through
ukraine
if
the
pipeline
is
completed
putin
has
said
but
russia
has
stopped
shipments
of
gas
to
ukraine
in
winter
in
recent
years
over
a
series
of
pricing
disputes
critics
of
nord
stream
say
it
could
increase
russia
s
ability
to
manipulate
european
energy
markets
in
an
increase
in
tensions
russia
last
month
seized
three
ukrainian
naval
ships
off
the
coast
of
crimea
in
the
sea
of
azov
after
opening
fire
on
them
germany
s
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
said
this
month
that
berlin
will
not
withdraw
its
political
support
for
nord
stream
and
that
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
had
secured
a
pledge
from
putin
in
august
allowing
gas
shipments
across
ukraine
s
territory
fannon
made
his
comments
after
travelling
to
eastern
europe
to
discuss
projects
that
could
offer
europe
a
more
diverse
natural
gas
supply
those
included
a
floating
liquefied
natural
gas
terminal
on
the
adriatic
island
of
krk
that
could
one
day
receive
gas
imports
from
the
united
states
which
is
increasing
its
exports
of
the
fuel
or
the
eastern
mediterranean
fannon
said
he
expected
russia
s
aggression
in
the
sea
of
azov
to
boost
support
for
several
bills
in
the
congress
that
include
new
sanctions
on
russia
s
energy
sector
though
he
refrained
from
commenting
on
any
particular
legislation
