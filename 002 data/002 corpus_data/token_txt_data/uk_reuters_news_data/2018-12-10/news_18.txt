building
new
nuclear
reactors
in
france
would
not
be
economical
state
environment
agency
ademe
said
in
a
study
on
monday
contradicting
the
government
s
energy
strategy
as
well
as
utility
edf
s
investment
plans
in
a
speech
last
month
president
emmanuel
macron
said
nuclear
energy
would
remain
a
promising
technology
for
producing
energy
and
that
edf
s
epr
reactor
model
should
be
part
of
future
energy
options
macron
has
also
asked
edf
to
draw
up
a
plan
for
building
new
reactors
with
a
view
to
making
a
decision
about
nuclear
in
two
epr
reactors
under
construction
in
france
and
finland
are
years
behind
schedule
and
billions
of
euros
over
budget
the
development
of
an
nuclear
industry
would
not
be
competitive
ademe
said
adding
that
new
nuclear
plants
would
be
structurally
building
a
single
epr
in
would
require
to
billion
euros
of
subsidies
while
building
a
fleet
of
with
a
total
capacity
of
by
would
cost
the
state
billion
euros
despite
economies
of
scale
that
could
bring
down
the
epr
costs
to
euros
per
mwh
ademe
said
renewables
costs
could
fall
to
between
and
depending
on
the
technology
by
but
extending
the
existing
fleet
too
long
while
also
building
new
eprs
would
lead
to
overcapacity
compromising
returns
on
all
generation
assets
including
renewables
edf
which
generates
about
percent
of
french
electricity
with
nuclear
reactors
declined
to
comment
the
ademe
report
which
studied
energy
mix
scenarios
for
said
renewables
could
account
for
percent
of
power
generation
by
and
more
than
percent
by
except
if
the
government
pushes
through
the
epr
option
anyway
the
gradual
increase
of
renewables
capacity
could
reduce
the
electricity
cost
for
consumers
including
generation
grids
and
storage
to
about
euros
per
mwh
compared
to
nearly
euros
today
ademe
said
ademe
director
arnaud
leroy
appointed
in
february
helped
write
the
energy
chapter
of
macron
s
election
programme
and
was
a
spokesman
for
his
campaign
but
the
agency
is
independent
and
earlier
studies
have
also
contradicted
government
energy
policy
in
a
ademe
study
suggesting
that
france
could
switch
to
percent
renewable
energy
by
at
a
cost
similar
to
sticking
