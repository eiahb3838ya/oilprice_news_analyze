snowballed
on
monday
with

emerged
that
the

on

economic
growth
data
from
the
world
s
biggest
economies
the
united
states
china
japan
and
germany
have
all
disappointed

in
recent
days
and
doubts
are
growing
that
washington
and
beijing
will
reach
agreement
before
a
trade
ceasefire
expires
markets
are
also
on

after

that
the
british

has
spent
four
weeks
in
the

fuelled
by
hopes
of

war

the

slipped

while
a

by

last
week
s
arrest
of
the
chief
financial
officer
of
chinese
smartphone
maker
huawei
for
extradition
to
the
united

was
seen
as
putting
up
another
hurdle
to
the
resolution
of
a
trade
war
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
said
sunday
there
was
a
hard
deadline
to
the
trade
ceasefire
and
without
a
successful
end
to
talks
by
march
washington
would
impose
new
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
the
trade
theme
will
preoccupy
the
markets
through
the

period
between
the
united
states
and
china
waiting
for
any
signs
of
concession
between
the
parties

expectations
beijing
will
roll
out
more
stimulus
to
prevent
the
economy
cooling
too
fast
however
the
yuan
sagged
to
a
low
after
the
weak
data
the
data
would
suggest
china
woes
go
well
beyond
tariffs
given
that
china
trade
surplus
to
the
was
at
a
record
level
one
can
only
imagine
the
impact
on
china
terms
of
trade
if
the
follows
through
with
a
percent
tariff
innes
of
oanda
said
japan
posted
the
worst
