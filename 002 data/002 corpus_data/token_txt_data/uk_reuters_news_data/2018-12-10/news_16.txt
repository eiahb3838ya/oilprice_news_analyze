the
ground
the
united
states
has
an
abundance
of
natural
resources
and
is
not
going
to
keep
them
in

ground
we

share
them
with
the
world
and
strive
to
do
that
in
the
most
efficient
and
cleanest
way
possible
griffith
told
journalists
later
on
saturday
parties
failed
to
reach
an
agreement
on
whether
to
note
or
welcome
the
ipcc
report
published
in
october
the
united
states
saudi
arabia
russia
and
kuwait
were
against
welcoming
the
findings
of
the
report
and
reference
to
the
ipcc
report
was
removed
saudi
arabia
issued
a
statement
saying
it
recognised
the
efforts
of
the
united
nations
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
in
producing
scientific
reports
the
latest
of
which
was
published
in
october
assessing
the
feasibility
and
importance
of
limiting
warming
to
degrees
celsius
however
it
said
there
were
gaps
and
uncertainties
in
the
report
which
still
needed
further
research
the
kingdom
of
saudi
arabia
is
hopeful
that
the
ipcc
assessment
report
will
address
these
gaps
and
challenges
and
that
a
consensus
to
welcome
it
among
all
parties
can
be
reached
it
said
in
a
statement
ministers
from
around
countries
started
to
arrive
at
the
conference
and
faced
the
task
of
breaking
deadlocks
and
divisions
to
achieve
the
political
compromises
needed
by
the
end
of
the
week
a
new
draft
text
of
the
rules
of
the
agreement
must
be
ready
by
tomorrow
for
ministers
to
work
on
the
polish
presidency
said
let
me
be
very
clear
a
lot
of
work
remains
to
be
done
we
are
clearly
not
yet
there
and
ministerial
discussions
take
over
this
week
said
miguel
arias
canete
european
commissioner
for
energy
and
climate
campaigners
in
katowice
said
another
weekend
of
the
violent
yellow
vests
protests
in
france
showed
why
a
just
transition
is
needed
when
shaping
energy
transition
policy
when
you
look
at
the
demands
from
the
protests
in
france
it
is
not
pitting
climate
policy
against
economic
and
social
policy
it
is
saying
that
we
need
to
respond
to
the
anxieties
people
are
feeling
the
fear
people
are
feeling
said
camilla
born
senior
policy
advisor
at
a
organisation
french
president
emmanuel
macron
will
address
the
country
on
monday
as
he
seeks
to
placate
yellow
vest
protesters
who
