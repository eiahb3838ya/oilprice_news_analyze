governments
should
not
use
the
violent
protests
in
france
that
were
sparked
by
a
carbon
tax
increase
as
an
excuse
to
stem
policies
to
curb
global
warming
french
officials
said
on
monday
french
secretary
of
state
for
ecology
brune
poirson
and
laurent
fabius
who
presided
over
the
paris
climate
agreement
said
countries
must
keep
up
the
momentum
of
that
deal
which
aims
to
limit
temperature
rise
to
between
degrees
to
degrees
celsius
by
it
would
be
a
error
to
think
that
because
there
are
problems
in
france
we
should
abandon
ecological
transition
fabius
told
reporters
on
the
sidelines
of
the
climate
conference
in
poland
the
former
foreign
minister
whose
handling
of
the
paris
negotiations
earned
him
worldwide
praise
said
countries
could
not
afford
to
curb
climate
policies
because
the
consequences
would
be
even
more
devastating
we
must
move
towards
that
transition
but
the
transition
must
be
just
he
said
adding
that
policymakers
must
ensure
that
funds
earmarked
for
green
policies
are
used
for
that
purpose
which
was
not
the
case
in
france
speaking
in
a
separate
briefing
ecology
minister
poirson
said
one
of
the
key
messages
from
the
protests
was
that
green
taxes
had
to
target
industries
and
not
just
citizens
and
governments
needed
to
communicate
their
aims
more
clearly
to
the
public
she
said
the
french
government
was
exploring
ways
to
revamp
fiscal
policies
to
achieve
environmental
aims
that
means
embracing
green
budgeting
it
is
really
difficult
because
it
means
radically
changing
they
way
our
institutions
the
way
our
bureaucracy
work
but
i
don
t
see
how
we
could
do
it
differently
poirson
said
the
yellow
vests
protests
in
france
prompted
president
donald
trump
to
call
for
the
end
of
what
he
said
was
a
ridiculous
and
extremely
expensive
paris
trump
has
already
pulled
out
of
the
deal
