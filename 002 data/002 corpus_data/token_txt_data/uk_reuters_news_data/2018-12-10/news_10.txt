libya
s
national
oil
company
noc
said
on
monday
it
has
declared
force
majeure
on
exports
from
the
el
sharara
oilfield
after
the
facility
was
seized
by
local
militia
noc
said
in
a
statement
the
shutdown
of
its
biggest
oilfield
would
result
in
a
production
loss
of
barrels
per
day
bpd
at
the
site
and
an
additional
loss
of
bpd
at
the
el
feel
oilfield
production
at
the
zawiya
refinery
was
also
at
risk
due
to
its
dependence
on
crude
oil
supply
from
sharara
the
company
said
noc
demands
that
the
group
leave
the
oilfield
immediately
without
the
statement
said
it
said
it
was
reviewing
evacuation
plans
but
did
not
say
whether
staff
had
actually
left
the
site
a
spokesman
for
noc
could
not
be
immediately
reached
for
comment
noc
said
in
a
statement
on
sunday
that
armed
militia
had
stormed
onto
the
premises
on
saturday
after
some
guards
and
locals
claiming
to
be
attached
to
the
guard
force
had
opened
the
gates
members
of
the
group
then
drove
around
in
jeeps
filming
themselves
in
videos
they
sent
to
journalists
sources
told
reuters
that
local
tribesmen
were
also
in
the
group
they
stayed
overnight
in
the
vast
partly
unsecured
area
making
good
on
a
threat
first
issued
in
october
to
stop
production
if
authorities
did
not
provide
more
development
funds
for
their
impoverished
region
noc
blamed
a
militia
which
it
said
was
claiming
to
be
attached
to
the
state
security
force
assigned
to
guard
el
sharara
in
libya
armed
men
often
friends
or
relatives
of
existing
guards
have
regularly
blocked
oilfields
to
get
added
to
the
state
payroll
noc
will
not
take
part
in
negotiations
with
the
militia
or
is
willing
to
compromise
following
their
decision
to
revert
to
violence
insulting
language
and
theft
the
company
said
in
its
statement
libya
is
divided
and
run
by
two
weak
governments
and
armed
groups
tribesmen
and
normal
libyans
tend
to
vent
their
anger
about
high
inflation
and
a
lack
of
infrastructure
on
the
noc
which
they
see
as
a
cash
cow
booking
billions
of
dollars
in
annual
oil
and
gas
revenues
before
the
force
majeure
libya
had
been
producing
up
to
million
barrels
of
oil
a
day
its
highest
level
since
when
a
wave
of
oilfield
blockages
started
part
of
turmoil
since
muammar
gaddafi
was
toppled
in
oilfield
blockades
like
the
current
one
tend
to
be
solved
by
authorities
quickly
giving
more
money
to
guards
or
locals
living
close
by
to
ensure
they
leave
the
site
this
blockade
might
be
more
complicated
to
resolve
because
the
group
that
seized
the
facility
included
tribesmen
who
have
said
they
want
development
funds
to
improve
hospitals
and
other
state
services
which
might
take
time
to
realise
