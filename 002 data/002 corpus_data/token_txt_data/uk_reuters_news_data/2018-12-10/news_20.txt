reuters
hess
corp
and
conocophillips
expect
to
produce
more
oil
in
than
last
year
without
altering
their
exploration
budget
in
a
big
way
the
two
oil
and
gas
producers
said
on
monday
conoco
will
spend
more
on
alaska
and
canada
than
before
in
the
next
year
while
keeping
expenses
in
continental
united
states
which
includes
the
costly
and
crowded
permian
basin
largely
unchanged
pipelines
in
the
basin
are
running
at
full
capacity
while
unprecedented
drilling
has
resulted
in
labor
shortage
conoco
said
it
will
spend
billion
on
alaska
from
its
total
capital
expenditure
of
billion
in
partly
a
result
of
a
recently
sanctioned
oil
project
there
in
the
company
expects
to
spend
less
than
billion
in
the
region
meanwhile
hess
said
the
lion
s
share
of
its
billion
capital
expenditure
in
will
be
used
for
exploration
in
guyana
and
in
the
bakken
shale
region
of
eastern
montana
and
western
north
dakota
the
company
s
spending
in
guyana
largely
focuses
on
production
from
its
offshore
discoveries
in
partnership
with
exxon
mobil
that
now
total
more
than
billion
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
the
raised
production
forecasts
come
as
global
oil
markets
struggle
with
oversupply
resulting
in
producer
group
opec
and
other
key
exporters
agreeing
to
cut
their
crude
output
from
january
production
however
is
expected
to
rise
to
a
record
high
of
million
bpd
in
and
million
bpd
in
for
hess
production
is
expected
to
range
between
and
excluding
libya
up
from
the
it
expects
in
while
conocophillips
was
aiming
to
produce
percent
more
oil
and
gas
next
year
as
we
focus
spending
on
our
high
return
investment
opportunities
we
will
continue
to
reduce
our
unit
costs
to
drive
margin
expansion
and
improve
profitability

john
hess
said
in
a
statement
last
week
oil
major
chevron
corp
increased
its
spending
budget
for
the
first
time
in
four
years
the
company
said
it
plans
to
spend
more
on
shale
production
next
year
as
well
as
in
refining
and
chemicals
