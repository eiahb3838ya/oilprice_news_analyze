the

weighed
down
by

stemming
from

global
equities
have
fallen
by
nearly
percent
so
far
this
year
battered
by
concern
about
slowing
corporate

and
the
threat
to
the
broader
economy

in
the

three
largest

has
made
a
number
of
analysts
wary
about
the
prospect
of
demand
being
sufficient
to
mop
up
extra
oil
as
usual
prices
are
not
a
target
of

but
our
takeaway
is
that
current
price
levels
largely
meet
the
interests
of
