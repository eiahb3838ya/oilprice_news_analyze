in
a
cold
sparsely
lit
room
sitting
close
to
the
heater
ainura
ibraimjanova
taps
at
her
computer
in
this
rural
district
in
southern
kyrgyzstan
she
is
the
only
lawyer
providing
free
legal
aid
just
back
from
court
in
the
alai
district
ibraimjanova
is
attending
to
a
stream
of
clients
in
thick
coats
and
clutching
documents
they
are
in
need
of
help
with
alimony
divorce
or
family
land
disputes
the
laws
have
changed
considerably
since
kyrgyzstan
gained
its
independence
because
there
was
a
real
gap
in
legal
frameworks
and
customs
with
many
people
breaching
laws
in
favour
of
customs
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
land
a
scarce
and
resource
in
this
former
communist
country
is
of
huge
social
value
she
said
with
disputes
over
it
particularly
affecting
women
having
or
not
having
a
piece
of
land
decides
who
you
are
it
s
a
very
important
matter
especially
in
a
rural
area
said
ibraimjanova
at
independence
in
when
state
property
was
privatised
every
citizen
was
given
an
equal
plot
of
land
but
it
was
often
registered
under
the
name
of
the
male
household
head
that
meant
women
often
missed
out
on
claiming
land
rights
especially
if
they
got
married
or
divorced
ibraimjanova
said
according
to
kyrgyz
tradition
people
treat
men
and
women
in
different
ways
if
a
girl
grows
up
and
chooses
to
take
her
share
of
land
with
her
and
separate
from
her
big
family
this
really
looks
strange
in
accordance
with
local
tradition
and
the
family
is
usually
opposed
to
it
she
said
although
courts
often
rule
in
favour
of
women
and
in
accordance
with
the
law
executing
such
judgments
can
be
arduous
and
take
years
ibraimjanova
said
there
are
still
many
women
who
need
to
be
supported
and
whose
rights
needs
to
be
better
yet
change
is
coming
even
to
remote
regions
like
alai
in
part
thanks
to
the
bus
of
solidarity
the
small
van
bounds
along
rural
roads
to
bring
lawyers
notaries
and
social
workers
to
remote
parts
of
the
country
to
resolve
villagers
legal
quandaries
for
free
it
is
supported
by
the
justice
ministry
and
the
development
programme
undp
on
this
day
it
is
headed
for
the
craggy
village
of
in
southern
kyrgyzstan
among
those
waiting
in
the
rain
for
the
bus
to
arrive
was
zoora
jumabaeva
i
learned
by
chance
that
the
bus
was
coming
today
jumabaeva
a
user
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
she
hoped
the
lawyers
could
resolve
her
complaint
with
the
local
bazaar
after
the
new
owner
raised
rents
and
forcibly
removed
her
stall
which
sells
medicine
for
livestock
to
a
location
outside
the
market
had
the
bus
not
come
jumabaeva
would
have
had
to
make
an
arduous
journey
on
poor
roads
to
the
nearest
town
osh
to
seek
legal
services
in
previous
years
she
would
use
informal
mechanisms
such
as
a
council
of
elders
to
solve
her
disputes
but
she
said
the
fact
that
their
decisions
were
not
legally
binding
was
frustrating
and
so
bearing
the
rain
and
cold
jumabaeva
huddled
at
a
small
desk
inside
a
billowing
blue
tent
to
explain
her
dilemma
i
m
losing
my
regular
income
and
my
family
is
suffering
i
came
here
today
to
get
some
more
legal
advice
on
protecting
my
interests
she
told
a
lawyer
there
are
many
other
women
and
young
families
at
the
market
who
suffer
more
than
me
from
being
evicted
as
this
was
their
only
income
source
so
i
m
trying
to
act
on
their
behalf
to
solve
a
common
the
lawyer
jazgul
kolmatova
who
practises
in
osh
is
no
stranger
to
the
bus
of
solidarity
having
made
several
journeys
jumabaeva
s
paperwork
she
said
was
scant
she
came
to
us
with
quite
a
difficult
and
complex
problem
but
her
case
is
a
fairly
common
one
kolmatova
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
as
she
took
down
notes
boarding
the
bus
provides
a
chance
to
resolve
knotty
legal
issues
that
have
often
been
building
for
years
she
said
i
joined
the
bus
of
solidarity
because
i
know
that
the
rural
population
and
especially
women
are
very
poorly
educated
in
legal
issues
and
i
want
to
make
my
contribution
to
changing
this
situation
she
said
since
the
bus
began
running
in
it
has
visited
about
villages
and
carried
out
more
than
consultations
according
to
undp
but
meetings
are
often
brief
and
complex
cases
require

a
luminous
orange

gulzina
ashimzhanova
said
she
met
ibraimjanova
when
the
bus
of
solidarity
came
to
her
village
earlier
this
year
ashimzhanova
and
her
five
children
were
made
homeless
when
she
left
her
alcoholic
husband
who
she
said
was
violent
ashimzhanova
wanted
to
divorce
him
and
secure
her
share
of
the
property
when
we
went
to
the
village
we
saw
the
bus
and
met
ainura
ibraimjanova
she
told
us
about
this
free
legal
assistance
she
explained
everything
she
said
we
were
consulted
from
there
then
she
said
to
bring
the
documents
and
she
could
help
me
she
said
we
could
divide
the
house
and
get
alimony
via
the
ashimzhanova
who
has
been
clinically
depressed
tried
to
get
her
share
of
a
house
square
metres
of
land
and
an
apple
orchard
all
registered
in
her
husband
s
name
i
need
to
get
a
house
for
my
children
ashimzhanova
said
i
don
t
want
my
rights
to
be
for
ibraimjanova
the
case
though
legally
carries
a
heavy
social
stigma
because
ashimzhanova
left
her
husband
and
wants
an
equal
share
of
their
common
property
gulzina
ashimzhanova
from
my
point
of
view
is
very
brave
to
act
like
this
and
i
m
sure
her
example
can
inspire
many
others
ibraimjanova
said
i
told
her
if
she
does
fight
for
her
rights
that
could
set
a
good
example
for
other
women
in
kyrgyzstan
too
there
could
be
many
others
who
are
also
shy
and
this
step
of
hers
could
give
them
a
push
