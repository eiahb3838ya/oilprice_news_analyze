griffith
said
it
was
important
to
be
pragmatic
in
dealing
with
climate
change
in
a
world
still
heavily
reliant
on
fossil

alarmism
should
not
silence
realism
this
administration
does
not
see
the
benefit
of
being

an
agreement
which
impedes
economic
growth
and

it
would
hurt
the
economy
and
that
the
science
of
climate
change
is
not
clear

new
technologies
which
will
be
emitting
the

emissions
however
the
energy
information
administration
has
forecast
that
coal
demand
will
fall
this
year

its

industry
moves
further
towards
natural
