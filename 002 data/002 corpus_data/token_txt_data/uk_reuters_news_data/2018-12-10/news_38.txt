taxing
the
extraction
of
fossil
fuels
could
help
pay
for
the
growing
costs
of
damage
from
harsher
storms
wildfires
floods
and
rising
seas
while
providing
a
stronger
incentive
to
wean
the
world
off
energy
green
groups
said
on
monday
a
climate
damages
tax
levied
on
oil
gas
and
coal
companies
could
raise
billion
a
year
by
to
bail
out
communities
bearing
the
brunt
of
global
warming
said
a
proposal
supported
by
wwf
practical
action
and
others
the
tax
would
lay
the
cost
of
rising
disaster
losses
directly
on
the
industries
most
responsible
for
them
they
said
in
a
report
released
at
climate
negotiations
in
poland
besides
assisting
those
in
need
overseas
a
large
share
of
income
from
the
tax
could
help
poorer
groups
at
home
take
up
green
jobs
energy
and
transport
backers
said
spending
on
social
justice
measures
is
seen
as
crucial
to
avoiding
the
kind
of
protests
france
has
seen
in
recent
weeks
over
rising
living
costs
sparked
partly
by
hikes
in
fuel
taxes
the
injustice
of
climate
change
is
that
the
impacts
are
felt
first
and
hardest
by
those
with
the
least
responsibility
for
its
causes
ralph
regenvanu
vanuatu
s
foreign
affairs
minister
said
in
a
statement
his
pacific
island
nation
lost
percent
of
its
gdp
about
million
during
cyclone
pam
in
and
has
struggled
to
recover
financially
he
noted
new
sources
of
finance
are
needed
to
help
address
this
he
said
adding
there
was
strong
justification
to
tax
the
fossil
fuel
industry
to
pay
for
the
climate
damage
it
is
causing
from
the
proposed
tax
would
levy
on
each
tonne
of
emissions
expected
to
be
produced
by
oil
coal
and
gas
deposits
that
are
extracted
from
the
ground
the
money
would
flow
through
existing
national
systems
for
royalty
payments
where
fossil
fuel
companies
operate
with
a
share
going
to
the
international
green
climate
fund
or
similar
bodies
to
help
pay
for
losses
around
the
world
the
report
said
part
of
the
levy
would
stay
in
nations
with
fossil
fuel
industries
to
help
their
workers
find
new
jobs
and
pay
for
cleaner
infrastructure
for
communities
it
said
poorer
fossil
states
such
as
indonesia
and
nigeria
would
keep
all
the
funds
raised
with
nations
such
as
china
and
colombia
retaining
a
larger
share
of
income
than
richer
countries
the
tax
would
rise
by
a
year
until
rising
to
a
annual
increase
after
that
through
when
fossil
fuels
must
be
largely
phased
out
of
global
energy
systems
to
meet
government
commitments
made
under
the
paris
climate
accord
the
world
must
wean
itself
off
fossil
fuels
if
we
are
to
protect
the
planet
and
we
must
do
so
quickly
manuel
wwf
s
climate
and

head
and
former
peruvian
environment
minister
said
in
a
statement
supporting
the
tax
richards
one
of
the
report
s
authors
said
the
tax
was
a
practical
way
to
address
the
injustice
at
the
heart
of
climate
change
the
fossil
fuel
industry
makes
hundreds
of
billions
in
profits
while
the
true
costs
of
their
products
are
paid
by
the
rest
of
society
she
added
there
are
precedents
for
such
taxes
on
tobacco
oil
spills
and
the
nuclear
industry
she
noted
and
as
losses
mount
from
wilder
weather
a
fossil
fuel
levy
could
become
more
politically
palatable
she
added
storm
damage
in
the
united
states
and
the
caribbean
alone
last
year
amounted
to
more
than
billion
representing
nearly
of
global
losses
caused
by
natural
disasters
in
the
