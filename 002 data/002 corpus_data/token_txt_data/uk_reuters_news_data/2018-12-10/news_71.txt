data
early

showed
the

contracted
the

in

in

as

cut
capital

amid
uncertainty
over

trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
said
on
sunday
clarifying
there
is
a
hard
deadline
after
a
week
of
seeming
confusion
among
president
donald
trump
and
his
advisers
markets
were
already
reeling
on
news
that
canadian
officials
had
arrested
the
chief
financial
officer
of
chinese
smartphone
maker
huawei
for
extradition
to
the
united
states
the
arrest
was
seen
as
an
added
threat
to
the
resolution
of
a
trade
war
between
the
world
s
top
two
economies
wall
street
s
main
indexes
fell
more
than
percent
on
friday
in
a
broad
posting
their
largest
weekly
percentage
drops
since
march
the
biggest
concerns
for
equity
markets
currently
is
the
trade
conflict
and
the
huawei
incident
said
soichiro
monji
senior
economist
at
daiwa
sb
investments
in
tokyo
the
trade
theme
will
preoccupy
the
markets
through
the
truce
period
between
the
united
states
and
china
waiting
for
any
signs
of
concession
between
the
trump
and
chinese
president
xi
jinping
early
this
month
agreed
to
a
temporary
truce
that
delayed
a
planned
tariff
hike
while
the
two
sides
negotiate
while
officials
say
the
huawei
arrest
was
a
legal
matter
and
not
linked
to
the
trade
dispute
the
move
is
expected
to
complicate
trade
talks
even
though
president
trump
said
the
incident
will
not
derail
the
talks
the
markets
should
not
underestimate
the
nationalism
hype
which
may
create
the
hurdle
for
china
to
make
concessions
wrote
strategists
at
ocbc
bank
the
dollar
was
on
the
backfoot

underscoring
faltering
global
