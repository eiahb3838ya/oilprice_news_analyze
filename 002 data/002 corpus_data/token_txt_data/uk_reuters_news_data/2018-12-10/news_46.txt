london
dec
reuters
a
small
british
energy
supplier
one
select
has
ceased
to
trade
regulator
ofgem
said
on
monday
promising
to
find
a
new
supplier
soon
for
its
customers
this
is
the
third
small
energy
supplier
to
have
ceased
trading
in
as
many
weeks
and
ofgem
said
last
month
it
would
introduce
financial
and
customer
service
tests
for
new
entrants
to
beef
up
their
robustness
we
have
seen
a
number
of
supplier
failures
this
year
and
our
safety
net
procedures
are
working
as
they
should
to
protect
customers
ofgem
said
in
a
statement
a
push
to
increase
competitiveness
in
britain
s
energy
market
has
reduced
the
market
share
of
the
six
largest
companies
to
percent
from
over
percent
in
recent
years
with
smaller
independent
companies
in
operation
however
their
rapid
rise
has
led
to
questions
over
their
viability
as
with
less
capital
available
to
make
hedges
some
may
have
been
vulnerable
to
soaring
wholesale
commodity
price
rises
and
renewable
subsidy
charges
