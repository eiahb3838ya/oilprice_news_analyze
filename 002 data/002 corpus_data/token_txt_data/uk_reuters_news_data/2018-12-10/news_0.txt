update 7-to quell unrest, france's macron speeds up tax cuts but vows no u-turn
paris
reuters
france
s
president
emmanuel
macron
on
monday
announced
wage
rises
for
the
poorest
workers
and
tax
cuts
for
pensioners
in
further
concessions
meant
to
defuse
weeks
of
often
violent
protests
that
have
challenged
his
authority
in
his
first
national
address
following
france
s
worst
unrest
for
years
macron
sought
to
restore
calm
and
struck
a
humble
tone
after
accusations
his
governing
style
and
economic
policies
were
fracturing
the
country
but
he
refused
to
reinstate
a
wealth
tax
and
to
back
down
on
his
reform
agenda
which
he
said
would
proceed
in
with
overhauls
of
pensions
unemployment
benefits
and
public
expenditures
we
will
respond
to
the
economic
and
social
urgency
with
strong
measures
by
cutting
taxes
more
rapidly
by
keeping
our
spending
under
control
but
not
with
macron
said
in
the
tv
address
from
the
elysee
palace
his
response
came
hours
after
protesters
fought
street
battles
with
riot
police
torching
cars
and
looting
shops
the
fourth
weekend
of
protests
for
the
yellow
vest
movement
which
started
as
a
revolt
against
high
fuel
costs
in
measures
that
are
likely
to
cost
billions
to
state
coffers
macron
said
people
on
the
minimum
wage
would
see
their
salaries
rise
by
euros
a
month
in
without
extra
costs
to
employers
his
labor
minister
said
this
would
be
achieved
by
government
topping
up
small
salaries
pensioners
earning
less
than
euros
per
month
will
see
this
year
s
increase
in
social
security
taxes
scrapped
macron
said
going
back
on
a
measure
that
had
particularly
hurt
his
popularity
with
older
voters
the
effort
we
asked
for
was
too
big
and
was
not
asked
whether
the
budget
deficit
would
be
kept
below
the
eu
limit
of
percent
an
elysee
official
said
france
had
some
wiggle
room
on
spending
if
a
tax
rebate
which
inflates
its
deficit
by
billion
euros
in
was
not
taken
into
account
olivier
dussopt
junior
minister
for
public
accounts
said
on
bfm
tv
the
measures
would
cost
billion
euros
billion
macron
faced
a
delicate
task
he
needed
to
persuade
the
middle
class
and
workers
that
he
heard
their
anger
over
a
squeeze
on
household
spending
without
being
exposed
to
charges
of
caving
in
to
street
politics
the
old
former
investment
banker
was
also
under
pressure
to
make
amends
about
cutting
remarks
he
has
made
about
the
costs
of
welfare
that
critics
say
made
him
look
aloof
and
arrogant
no
doubt
over
the
past
year
and
a
half
we
have
not
provided
answers
that
were
strong
and
quick
enough
i
take
my
share
of
responsibility
he
said
i
may
have
given
the
impression
that
i
did
not
care
about
that
that
i
had
other
priorities
i
also
know
that
i
have
hurt
some
of
you
with
my
political
opponents
who
have
largely
failed
so
far
to
tap
into
the
discontent
from
the
leaderless
yellow
vest
criticized
macron
s
response
as
insufficient
emmanuel
macron
thought
he
could
hand
out
some
cash
to
calm
the
citizen
s
insurrection
that
has
erupted
said
melenchon
leader
of
the
la
france
insoumise
i
believe
that
act
v
of
the
protests
will
play
out
on
saturday
he
said
referring
to
a
new
round
of
protests
planned
this
weekend
one
of
the
faces
of
the
yellow
vest
movement
appeared
unconvinced
as
well
in
terms
of
substance
these
are
half
measures
we
can
feel
that
macron
has
got
a
lot
more
to
give
