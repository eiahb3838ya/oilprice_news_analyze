with

following
asian

lower
as
fresh
signs
emerged
of
slowing

worldwide
and

grew
that

msci
s
index
has
spent
four
weeks
in
the
red
despite
intermittent
rallies
fuelled
by
hopes
of
trade
war
detente
the
pessimism
has
been
exacerbated
by
data
showing
the
world
s
largest
economies
the
united
states
china
japan
and
germany
are
all
headed
for
slower
growth
that
pushed
the
index
percent
lower
while
a
index
fell
almost
one
percent
by

and
equity
futures
were
down
percent
suggesting
more

s
arrest
of
the
chief
financial
officer
of
chinese
smartphone
maker
huawei
for
extradition
to
the
united
states
was
seen
putting
up
another
hurdle
to
the
resolution
of
a
trade
war
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
said
sunday
there
was
a
hard
deadline
to
the
trade
ceasefire
and
without
a
successful
end
to
talks
by
march
washington
would
impose
new
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
the
trade
theme
will
preoccupy
the
markets
through
the
truce
period
between
the
united
states
and
china
waiting
for
any
signs
of
concession
between
the
parties

reinforcing
expectations
beijing
will
roll
out
more
stimulus
to
prevent
the
economy
cooling
too
fast
however
the
yuan
sagged
to
a
low
after
the
weak
data
the
data
would
suggest
china
woes
go
well
beyond
tariffs
given
that
china
trade
surplus
to
the
was
at
a
record
level
one
can
only
imagine
the
impact
on
china
terms
of

innes
of
oanda
said
japan
posted
the
worst

spooked
last
week
by
industrial
output
numbers
in
germany
and
jobs
data
showing
employers
hired
fewer
workers
than
expected
in
november
the
slowdown

also
have
pummelled
oil

have
slumped
around
percent

october

weakened
the

while
that
raises
fears
of
a
chaotic

those

encouraged
by
a
