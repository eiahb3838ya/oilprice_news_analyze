reuters
the
south
african
government
needs
to
bite
the
bullet
and
bail
out
struggling
power
firm
eskom
which
has
asked
for
billion
rand
billion
pounds
in
government
support
the
chief
executive
of
rothschild
co
in
south
africa
told
reuters
rothschild
advised
eskom
in
when
it
last
received
a
major
cash
injection
from
government
at
the
time
eskom
sought
billion
rand
but
was
granted
a
billion
rand
loan
which
was
later
converted
into
equity
eskom
has
implemented
controlled
power
cuts
for
much
of
the
past
week
which
could
erode
support
for
the
ruling
african
national
congress
at
next
year
s
national
election
opinion
is
divided
on
whether
eskom
which
provides
more
than
percent
of
south
africa
s
power
but
was
embroiled
in
corruption
scandals
under
its
previous
management
should
be
bailed
out
again
rothschild
s
martin
kingston
said
in
an
interview
that
recapitalising
eskom
could
cost
the
country
its
last
investment
grade
credit
rating
but
that
there
was
no
other
obvious
solution
if
eskom
was
to
survive
the
government
knows
that
putting
money
into
eskom
is
going
to
exacerbate
a
downgrade
scenario
but
i
think
it
is
going
to
have
to
bite
that
bullet
kingston
said
the
level
of
debt
on
eskom
s
balance
sheet
is
completely
eskom
s
debt
has
ballooned
from
around
billion
rand
to
more
than
billion
rand
over
the
past
decade
while
electricity
sales
have
fallen
eskom
executives
told
investors
on
a
roadshow
last
week
they
wanted
the
state
to
take
on
billion
rand
of
the
company
s
debt
but
finance
minister
tito
mboweni
is
yet
to
approve
the
proposal
and
has
said
the
state
can
not
afford
to
continue
pouring
money
into
state
firms
president
cyril
ramaphosa
has
made
reforming
eskom
a
priority
since
taking
office
in
february
but
the
scale
of
its
financial
difficulties
has
made
progress
slow
kingston
said
the
government
had
kicked
the
can
down
the
road
by
not
providing
eskom
with
more
funds
in
and
that
restructuring
the
utility
could
take
three
to
five
years
