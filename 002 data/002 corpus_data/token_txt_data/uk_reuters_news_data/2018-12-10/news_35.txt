aid
agencies
could
save
more
than
million
by
choosing
clean
energy
over
fossil
fuels
in
war
zones
and
disaster
areas
global
chatham
house
said
in
a
report
on
monday
humanitarian
agencies
spent
about
five
percent
of
their
funds
or
an
estimated
billion
on
diesel
last
year
and
could
save
million
each
year
by
using
cleaner
energy
sources
such
as
solar
power
it
said
humanitarians
are
operating
in
tough
environments
where
saving
lives
come
first
said
owen
grafham
from
the
moving
energy
initiative
mei
a
partnership
managed
by
chatham
house
energy
is
not
given
much
thought
diesel
is
the
fuel
because
it
s
what
agencies
are
used
to
and
it
s
he
said
in
a
statement
fossil
fuels
can
be
used
as
a
weapon
hijacked
by
militants
or
sold
on
the
black
market
and
sometimes
have
to
be
flown
vast
distances
to
reach
relief
camps
that
creates
costs
that
humanitarian
groups
can
ill
afford
with
wars
persecution
and
other
violence
having
uprooted
a
record
million
people
last
year
according
to
the
refugee
agency
aid
agencies
said
curbing
emissions
was
key
to
preventing
related
disasters
renewable
energy
is
key
to
reducing
emissions
under
a
global
climate
deal
after
governments
in
pledged
to
hold
temperature
rise
to
well
below
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
above
times
and
ideally
to
degrees
the
burning
of
dirty
fuels
increasingly
impacts
poor
people
particularly
women
and
girls
who
are
in
the
midst
of
humanitarian
crises

advocacy
arm
said
in
email
while
the
technology
has
not
advanced
far
enough
to
make
a
full
swap
viable
some
solar
projects
are
already
under
way
in
the
field
and
aid
workers
expect
many
more
to
follow
engineer
eriksson
from
the

msf
sweden
innovation
unit
said
the
group
was
making
substantial
effort
to
use
renewable
energy
however
it
is
not
certain
that
such
a
transformation
will
save
us
money
given
the
current
initial
costs
for
renewable
energy
infrastructure
our
operations
are
and
therefore
implicitly
short
term
he
said
the
investment
for
renewable
energy
solutions
is
always
higher
than
for
diesel
generator
solutions
and
so
the
savings
only
come
over
a
number
of
years
eriksson
said
from
haiti
where
he
is
testing
aid
groups
say
operations
also
relied
on
diesel
generators
since
many
local
workers
or
volunteers
already
knew
how
to
use
them
whereas
solar
energy
would
be
costly
and
require
specialised
knowledge
an
october
report
by
the
united
nations
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
said
renewable
energy
would
need
to
supply
percent
of
electricity
by
to
stay
within
a
limit
compared
with
about
percent
now
more
than
countries
are
meeting
in
poland
through
to
hammer
out
rules
that
will
enable
the
paris
accord
to
be
put
into
practice
from
