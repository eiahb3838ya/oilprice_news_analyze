more
city

if
the
world
is
to
avoid
catastrophic
climate
change
scientists
said
at
talks
on
monday
governments
at
the
climate
negotiations
in
poland
are
at
loggerheads
over
how
to
respond
to
a
scientific
report
that
says
temperatures
could
rise
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
from
times
as
early
as
but
city
representatives
said
they
had
moved
beyond
that
battle
and
were
now
taking
action
two
networks
representing
thousands
of
cities
said
in
a
statement
that
the
scientific
findings
were
unequivocal
and
cities
were
key
to
developing
a
future
a
tough
challenge
requiring
rapid
shifts
in
the
paris
agreement
governments
agreed
to
keep
global
warming
to
well
below
degrees
celsius
and
to
strive
for
a
degree
limit
a
new
guide
penned
by
authors
of
the
report
issued
in
october
by
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
translates
its
findings
into
specific
information
that
can
be
used
by
city
planners
the
authors
spanning
the
globe
from
the
united
states
to
india
said
they
had
produced
the
accessible
guide
for
cities
because
without
them
there
will
be
no
limiting
global
warming

in
urban
areas

expected
to
comprise

the
world
population
by
and
will
generate
a
growing
share
of
emissions
the
report
said
they
are
already
responsible
for
an
estimated
percent
of
emissions
according
to
un
environment
ipcc
author
seth
schultz
said
the
team
had
produced
the
guide
voluntarily
because
of
the
importance
and
significance
of
cities
in
ensuring
a
future
the
document
was
backed
by
a
group
of
cities
tackling
climate
change
and
the
global
covenant
of
mayors
for
climate
and
energy
an
alliance
of
cities
and
local
governments
urban
policymakers
must
seize
the
opportunity
said
the
guide
the
tools
are
at
risks
such
as
falling
yields
health
problems
and
slower
economic
growth
are
projected
to
be
far
worse
if
warming
tops
the
ipcc
report
said
the
cities
guide
said
limiting
global
warming
to
would
turn
in
part
on
the
feasibility
of
urban
actions
and
policies
buildings
along
city
streets
will
need
in
to
produce
about
percent
fewer
emissions
than
in
to
meet
the
goal
cities
could
also
become
sites
for
deploying
emerging
technologies
that
suck
carbon
out
of
the
atmosphere
to
limit
warming
the
guide
noted
cities
are
ready
to
lead

mayor

the
ipcc
plans
to

a
