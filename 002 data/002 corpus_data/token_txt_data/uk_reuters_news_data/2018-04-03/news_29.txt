update 1-u.s. locks in anti-dumping duties on biodiesel from argentina, indonesia
washington
reuters
the
international
trade
commission
said
on
tuesday
that
the
dumping
of
biodiesel
imports
from
argentina
and
indonesia
harms
american
producers
a
move
that
locks
in
place
duties
on
the
imports
the
commission
s
final
phase
determination
followed
a
commerce
department
move
in
february
to
add
duties
of
percent
to
percent
to
already
steep
duties
on
imported
biodiesel
from
argentina
and
indonesia
the
independent
panel
had
already
found
in
the
subsidy
cases
that
the
imports
caused
such
injuries
the
latest
duties
make
it
virtually
certain
that
biodiesel
from
argentina
and
indonesia
will
not
be
sold
in
the
market
with
combined
rates
of
up
to
percent
on
the
argentine
fuel
and
up
to
percent
on
indonesian
variety
the
trade
case
was
filed
by
the
national
biodiesel
board
and
member
companies
that
alleged
a
flood
of
subsidized
imports
sold
below
fair
market
value
was
preventing
producers
from
earning
an
adequate
return
the
vote
marked
the
last
procedural
hurdle
before
final
antidumping
orders
can
be
issued
this
month
the
board
said
in
a
statement
this
vote
today
finalizes
the
case
to
address
the
harm
that
unfair
trade
practices
have
had
on
the
biodiesel
industry
said
donnell
rehagen
the
board
s
chief
executive
officer
foreign
producers
dumping
product
into
american
markets
below
cost
has
undermined
the
jobs
and
environmental
benefits
that
biodiesel
brings
