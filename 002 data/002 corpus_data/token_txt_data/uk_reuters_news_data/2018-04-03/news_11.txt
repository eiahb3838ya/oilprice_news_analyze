rosatom
which

the
timetable
the

cited
the
head
of
rosatom
saying
the
sale
of
the
percent
stake
was
likely
to
be
postponed
from
this
year
until
turkish
companies
have
been
put
off
by
the
size
of
the
financing
required
as
well
as
by
concerns
they
will
not

sufficient
share
of
the
lucrative

turkey
signed
an
agreement
to
buy
the
system
in
late
december
in
a
move
which
raised
concern
in
the
west
because
it
can
not
be
integrated

military
