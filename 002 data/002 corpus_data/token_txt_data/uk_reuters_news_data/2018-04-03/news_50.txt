in
a

on

against
the
polish
environment
ministry
seeking
an
extension
to
the
company
s
exclusive
rights
to
a
mining

in
the

prairie
mining
secured
in
the
exclusive
right
to
apply
for
a
mining
concession
for
the
jan
karski
mine
in
southeast
poland
and
had
until
april
to
file
its
application
the
company
said
in
a
statement
on
tuesday
that
it
had
not
been
able
to
apply
for
the
concession
because
it
first
needs
to
obtain
an
environmental
permit
from
local
authorities
which
it
said
has
been
delayed
as
a
result
it
said
it
asked
the
ministry
in
december
to
sign
a
mining
usufruct
agreement
on
the
project
which
precludes
any
other
parties
being
granted
any
licence
over
all
or
part
of
the
jan
karski
concessions
the
ministry
was
required
by
law
to
have
responded
to
the
request
within
three
months
but
had
failed
to
do
so
prairie
said
in
a
statement
accordingly
the
company
has
now
commenced
legal
proceedings
against
the
ministry
of
environment
through
the
polish
courts
in
order
to
protect
the
company
s
security
of
tenure
over
the
jan
karski
concessions
the
company
said
prairie
s
share
price
had
previously
been
buoyed
by
plans
for
the
development
the
company
said
in
october
that
upfront
capital
costs
for
development
of
the
mine
totalled
million
and
that
it
was
in
advanced
talks
with
chinese
lenders
who
could
finance
percent
of
it
since
winning
the
general
election
in
the
conservative
law
and
justice
party
pis
has
introduced
many
regulatory
changes
prompting
some
investors
to
take
legal
action
against
the
government
prairie
in
its
lawsuit
demanded
that
the
mining
usufruct
agreement
be
signed
so
that
it
can
still
have
the
exclusive
right
to
apply
for
the
mining
concession
it
said
a
polish
civil
court
could
enforce
the
agreement
in
place
of
the
ministry
a
spokesman
for
the
environment
ministry
was
not
immediately
available
