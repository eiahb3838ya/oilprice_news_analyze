more
than

per

bpd
in

a
similar
volume
to
ecuador

guyana
plans
to
recruit
a

to
suggest
ways
of
valuing
and
negotiating
its
remaining
offshore

guyana
s
minister
of
natural
resources
raphael
trotman
told
reuters
in
an
interview
in
the
nation
s
capital
the
cabinet
has
made
a
decision
that
any
future
allocations
will
be
made
based
on
advice
from
a
firm
of
international
repute
that
has
advised
governments
on
this
kind
of
thing
before
and
that
is
how
we
intend
to
proceed
trotman
said
guyana
s
government
has
a
list
of
qualified
candidates
for
the
advisory
position
which
he
did
not
identify
no
oil
auctions
are
yet
planned
trotman
said
the
country
is
receiving
interest
from
major
oil
firms
including
france
s
total
spain
s
repsol
chevron
corp
and
italy
s
eni
trotman
said
the
same
majors
independents
and
national
oil
companies
also
are
active
in
auctions
in
brazil
and
mexico
and
studying
other
opportunities
in
latin
america
which
is
rushing
this
year
to
install
energy
reforms
to
attract
more
foreign
investment
among
the
blocks
that
guyana
could
make
available
is
a
deepwater
area
near
the
exxon
group
s
stabroek
located
miles
km
off
guyana
s
coast
as
well
as
several
blocks
the
exxon
consortium
which
paid
million
as
a
signing
bonus
for
its
guyana
blocks
expects
production
from
its
flagship
well
to
reach
bpd
by
the
group
has
made
seven
discoveries
off
the
coast
of
guyana
the
most
recent
in
february
from
the
exploration
well
at
the
stabroek
block
in
the
companies
signed
a
new
agreement
with
guyana
for
a
license
to
develop
its
blocks
the
deal
included
two
possible
extensions
the
parties
also
agreed
to
a
percent
royalty
and
profits
when
production
costs
are
recovered
under
guyana
s
petroleum
act
a
licensee
may
apply
for
no
more
than
blocks
but
the
minister
has
the
power
to
grant
more
than
that
which
is
what
trotman
said
he
did
with
the
exxon
consortium
we
sought
to
give
exxon
an
area
of
land
that
touched
the
two
boundary
lines
of
the
nation
and
that
was
strategic
he
said
guyana
has
sought
help
from
the
united
nations
and
the
international
court
of
justice
on
claims
by
neighboring
venezuela
to
its
land
and
offshore
acreage
