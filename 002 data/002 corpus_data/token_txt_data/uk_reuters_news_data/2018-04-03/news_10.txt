there

today
said
john

analyst
at

the
gains
were
in
part
the
result
of
a
technical
rebound
from
monday

losses
as
well
as
a
recovery
in

crude
inventories
widely
viewed
as
a
litmus
test
of
the
broader
trend
in
global
inventories
are
expected
to
have
risen
for
the
second
straight
week
according
to
a
reuters
poll
on
tuesday
analysts
anticipated
a
barrel
crude
stock
build
in
the
week
to
march
the
american
petroleum
institute
releases
its
weekly
inventory
data
later
on
tuesday
and
the
government
releases
its
figures
on
wednesday
there
is
also
an
element
of
seasonality
at
play
said
walter
zimmerman
chief
technical
analyst
at
yesterday
was
a
little
more
dramatic
than
might
typically
be
the
case
but
it
s
entirely
in
keeping
with
seasonal
peaking
risk
that
the
month
of
april
brings
to
crude
oil
he
said
also
weighing
on
the
market
is
speculative
length
after
money
managers
last
week
raised
their
bullish
bets
on
crude
with
excessive
hedge
fund
positions
still
looming
over
the
market
should
weigh
on
oil
prices
over
the

julius

norbert
ruecker
said
prices
for
physical
barrels
of
oil
in
the
north
sea
are
around
their
lowest
since
last
june
as
extensive
refinery
maintenance
across
the
region
eats
into
demand
