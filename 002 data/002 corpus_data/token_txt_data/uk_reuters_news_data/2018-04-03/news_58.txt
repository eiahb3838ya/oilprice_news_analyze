azmel
a
director
at
tesco
malaysia
said
percent
of
customers
have
their
own
carrier
bags
but
leave
them
in
the
car
rather
than
bringing
them
into
the
store
that
s
why
we
thought
of
the
idea
of
the
unforgettable
bag
it
s
a
bit
of
a
push
for
them
she
told
the

globally
according
to
industry
estimates
with
fewer

percent
recycled

world
s
oceans
or
dumped
in
landfill
more
than
million
tonnes
of
plastics
enter
the
ocean
each
year
and
marine
experts
fear
there
could
be
more
plastic
than
fish
in
the
ocean
by
measured
by
weight
plastic
degrades
over
time
into
tiny
particles
which
are
ingested
by
marine
life
harming
the
food
chain
and
environment
in
an
attempt
to
cut
down
on
waste
and
plastic
many
supermarkets
around
the
world
charge
customers

promote
reusable

countries
have
banned
partly
banned
or
taxed
plastic
bags
including
parts
of
malaysia
and
india
china
france
rwanda
italy
and

the
unforgettable

is
made
from
a
recyclable
plastic
that
is
more
durable
than
conventional
plastic
bags

the
risks
plastic

the

trial
the
first
of
its
kind
by
a
major
hypermarket
in
malaysia
limits
the
bag
discounts
to
two
per
transaction
the
scheme
will
be
extended
to
all
tesco
s
stores
in
malaysia
from
june
if
a
success
the
retailer
hopes
it
will
be
adopted
by
other
tesco
stores
across
asia
the
barcoded
bags
are
a
starting
point
towards
phasing
out
all
plastic
bags
from
tesco
shops
in
malaysia
said
azmel
every
malaysian
on
average
throws
away
plastic
bags

according
to
the
malaysian
plastics
manufacturers
association
von
hernandez
global
coordinator
of
the
break
free
from
plastic
movement
in
manila
welcomed
the
tesco
initiative
but
said
governments
and
business
in
asia
needed
to
do
more
we
ve
seen
governments
whether
at
city
or
national
level
take
action
to
restrict
the
use
of
plastics
said
hernandez
that
has
to
be
matched
by
the
corporate
there
is
increasing
momentum
for
similar
restrictions
in
many
parts
of
the
world
because
this
crisis
