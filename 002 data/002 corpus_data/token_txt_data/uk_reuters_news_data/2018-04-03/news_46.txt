for
the
first
time
in
at
least
four
decades
portugal
s
monthly
renewable
energy
production
in
march
exceeded
power
demand
on
the
mainland
an
industry
report
said
on
tuesday
adding
that
it
expected
this
to
become
a
trend
renewable
energy
accounted
for
percent
of
mainland
electricity
consumption
last
month
the
report
by
the
portuguese
renewable
energy
association
and
the
sustainable
earth
system
association
said
citing
data
from
power
grid
operator
ren
while
fossil
fuel
plants
still
worked
for
short
periods
to
complement
the
electricity
supply
those
were
fully
compensated
by
other
periods
of
greater
renewable
production
last
month
s
achievement
is
an
example
of
what
will
happen
more
frequently
in
the
near
future
it
is
expected
that
by
the
production
of
renewable
electricity
will
be
able
to
guarantee
in
a
way
the
total
annual
electricity
consumption
of
mainland
portugal
the
report
said
these
data
besides
indicating
a
historical
milestone
in
the
portuguese
electricity
sector
demonstrate
that
renewable
energy
can
be
relied
upon
as
a
secure
and
viable
source
with
which
to
completely
meet
the
country
s
electricity
separately
on
tuesday
the
government
suspended
subsidies
for
guaranteed
power
supplies
paid
to
producers
worth
about
million
euros
a
year
most
of
which
goes
to
fossil
fuel
plants
left
in
mode
hydroelectric
dams
in
march
accounted
for
percent
of
monthly
consumption
followed
by
wind
power
at
percent
portugal
with
its
long
atlantic
coast
line
was
one
of
the
early
pioneers
in
the
mass
use
of
wind
power
march
saw
four
times
the
monthly
average
rainfall
ending
a
long
period
of
severe
drought
in
the
country
according
to
the
portuguese
sea
and
atmosphere
institute
the
downpour
refilled
most
of
the
dammed
reservoirs
to
levels
of
over
percent
the
renewable
generation
reduced
portugal
s
carbon
dioxide
emissions
by
million
tons
and
helped
the
country
s
export
balance
the
average
daily
wholesale
market
price
fell
to
euros
per
mwh
from
euros
a
year
earlier
when
renewables
were
able
to
meet
only
percent
of
the
electricity
demand
amid
the
drought
portugal
s
electricity
prices
are
among
the
highest
in
