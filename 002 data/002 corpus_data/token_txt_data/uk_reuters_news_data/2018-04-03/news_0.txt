donald
trump
has
just
held
his
first
baltic
summit
with
the
leaders
of
latvia
lithuania
and
estonia
at
the
media
briefing
after
tuesday
s
meeting
the
president
america
s
commitment
to
their
deep
and
lasting
friendship
and
praised
his
baltic
counterparts
for
doing
terrific
with
tensions
rising
between
moscow
and
nato
these
three
countries
are
indeed
important
allies
and
the
administration
would
do
well
to
learn
from
their
expertise
on
the
frontline
of
russia
s
energy
cyber
and
propaganda
war
the
summit
which
took
place
against
a
backdrop
of
diplomatic
expulsions
after
britain
blamed
moscow
for
poisoning
a
former
russian
spy
in
the
uk
and
just
days
after
russia
its
new
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
sarmat
was
of
enormous
strategic
significance
when
president
barack
obama
met
with
the
leaders
of
the
three
baltic
nations
in
washington
in
he
called
them
the
united
states
most
reliable
allies
in
more
recently
vice
president
mike
pence
reaffirmed
washington
s
commitment
to
the
baltic
states
during
his
visit
to
the
estonian
capital
of
tallinn
in
saying
that
the
united
states
stands
firmly
behind
nato
s
article
pledge
of
mutual
defense
of
alliance
members
an
attack
on
one
of
us
is
an
attack
on
us
the
baltic
leaders
received
the
same
message
from
trump
who
praised
their
commitment
to
in
the
costs
of
nato
the
president
should
now
craft
a
careful
policy
to
show
washington
s
support
for
the
needs
of
the
nations
run
by
lithuania
s
dalia
grybauskaite
estonia
s
kersti
kaljulaid
and
latvia
s
raimonds
vejonis
the
baltic
states
are
not
simply
recipients
of
nato
s
protection
they
are
also
active
supporters
of
foreign
policy
since
joining
the
alliance
in
the
baltic
countries
have
participated
in
a
number
of
nato
missions
they
have
deployed
their
troops
to
afghanistan
as
part
of
operations
and
sent
soldiers
to
iraq
to
fight
islamic
state
in
addition
they
are
hosting
nato
battalions
in
their
countries
as
part
of
a
broader
bid
to
deter
russian
aggression
washington
which
already
has
sent
troops
to
norway
and
poland
should
consider
rotating
american
troops
through
the
baltic
republics
in
the
coming
years
as
well
all
three
baltic
states
have
gradually
increased
their
share
of
gdp
on
defense
since
estonia
was
one
of
only
five
nato
allies
that
met
the
benchmark
of
percent
spending
in
lithuania
and
latvia
reached
the
target
this
year
lithuania
also
reintroduced
conscription
in
while
estonia
has
had
the
draft
since
the
following
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
and
since
boosting
their
defense
budgets
they
will
spend
a
total
of
around
billion
on
defense
by
the
baltic
republics
have
also
been
purchasing
american
military
equipment
such
as
javelin
missiles
while
trump
has
been
vocal
about
expecting
nato
countries
to
boost
their
defense
spending
the
administration
should
help
the
baltic
countries
outline
their
broader
defense
priorities
once
they
ve
achieved
this
objective
in
addition
washington
should
broaden
its
cooperation
with
the
three
key
nato
centers
of
excellence
based
in
the
baltic
states
these
institutions
which
include
the
energy
security
centre
in
vilnius
lithuania
the
cooperative
cyber
defence
centre
in
tallinn
estonia
and
the
strategic
communications
centre
in
riga
latvia
are
intended
to
train
and
educate
specialists
from
nato
member
and
partner
countries
while
all
three
are
already
contributing
to
nato
operations
the
united
states
should
increase
the
involvement
of
experts
in
these
hubs
looking
further
east
washington
should
turn
to
its
baltic
allies
for
advice
on
plans
to
provide
support
for
the
nascent
democracies
in
the
east
the
baltic
states
and
poland
have
particularly
close
relations
with
countries
like
georgia
moldova
and
ukraine
in
the
european
union
s
eastern
partnership
eap
the
leaders
who
met
with
trump
in
washington
this
week
are
among
the
best
placed
and
informed
to
take
the
lead
in
shaping
eu
policy
on
this
initiative
the
trump
administration
should
also
take
guidance
from
the
baltic
leaders
on
the
best
way
to
optimize
programs
like
the
washington
s
emerging
donors
challenge
fund
which
allows
usaid
to
partner
with
donor
countries
on
a
range
of
development
and
programs
the
baltic
states
are
not
only
allies
in
the
defense
sector
in
lithuania
began
importing
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
from
the
united
states
along
with
poland
s
lng
terminal
expansion
and
polish
and
lithuanian
purchases
of
american
lng
this
signals
a
powerful
challenge
to
russia
s
dominance
in
europe
s
gas
markets
while
the
globalization
of
natural
gas
markets
is
boosting
diversification
options
for
states
the
arrival
of
american
gas
to
this
region
is
strategically
important
the
first
meeting
between
trump
and
his
baltic
counterparts
was
more
than
a
symbolic
encounter
with
the
rise
of
russian
aggression
it
was
important
to
reaffirm
the
united
states
support
for
its
friends
on
europe
s
frontlines
but
it
was
also
an
opportunity
for
the
trump
administration
to
build
deeper
relationships
that
move
beyond
rhetoric
with
allies
