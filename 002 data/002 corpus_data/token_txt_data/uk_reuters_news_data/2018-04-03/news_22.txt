exclusive-gazprom set to gain eu antitrust approval with concessions -sources
brussels
reuters
the
european
union
and
gazprom
are
poised
to
settle
a
antitrust
case
after
the
russian
gas
company
agreed
to
price
reforms
and
to
allow
rivals
to
gain
a
foothold
in
eastern
europe
people
familiar
with
the
matter
said
a
decision
by
the
european
commission
could
come
as
early
as
this
month
although
the
timing
could
still
slip
the
people
said
a
settlement
would
allow
gazprom
to
avoid
a
possible
fine
of
as
much
as
percent
of
its
global
turnover
the
case
underlines
the
rocky
relationship
between
europe
and
russia
which
have
clashed
over
ukraine
syria
and
most
recently
a
nerve
attack
against
a
former
russian
spy
living
in
england
that
resulted
in
expulsions
of
diplomats
on
both
sides
last
year
gazprom
which
supplies
a
third
of
the
eu
s
gas
offered
to
link
prices
to
benchmarks
such
as
western
european
gas
market
hubs
and
border
prices
in
france
germany
and
italy
and
allow
price
reviews
every
two
years
this
aimed
to
address
complaints
of
excessive
pricing
in
bulgaria
estonia
latvia
lithuania
and
poland
german
prices
due
to
gazprom
s
policy
of
locking
clients
into
contracts
the
company
also
pledged
to
scrap
all
contractual
restrictions
which
bar
clients
from
reselling
its
gas
and
let
the
bulgarian
transmission
network
operator
take
charge
of
the
balkan
country
s
gas
flows
to
greece
gazprom
will
drop
its
million
claim
for
damages
from
bulgarian
partner
beh
following
the
cancellation
of
the
south
stream
gas
pipeline
project
that
would
have
shipped
russian
gas
under
the
black
sea
via
bulgaria
to
central
europe
gazprom
has
tweaked
its
original
proposal
on
concessions
after
negative
feedback
from
eu
countries
and
customers
but
the
main
elements
remain
unchanged
according
to
a
recent
draft
seen
by
reuters
revisions
have
been
mainly
technical
such
as
lower
service
fees
charged
by
gazprom
which
could
result
in
its
clients
saving
millions
of
euros
the
concessions
are
expected
to
apply
for
eight
years
and
be
monitored
by
a
trustee
both
the
commission
and
gazprom
declined
to
comment
the
eu
competition
enforcer
has
rejected
a
complaint
by
polish
oil
and
gas
company
pgnig
which
wants
gazprom
to
sell
its
controlling
stake
in
companies
that
own
key
gas
infrastructure
in
the
eu
including
the
gas
pipeline
two
other
sources
said
the
eu
had
previously
said
this
was
not
covered
by
the
bloc
s
antitrust
rules
because
it
was
a
bilateral
deal
between
the
polish
and
russian
governments
gazprom
found
itself
in
the
eu
antitrust
crosshairs
in
after
regulators
raided
about
offices
of
its
customers
in
eastern
and
central
europe
seizing
more
than
documents
at
issue
was
whether
gazprom
had
imposed
unfair
prices
by
linking
gas
price
to
oil
prices
divided
up
gas
markets
by
hindering
the
free
flow
of
gas
across
eu
countries
and
prevented
the
diversification
of
the
supply
of
gas
