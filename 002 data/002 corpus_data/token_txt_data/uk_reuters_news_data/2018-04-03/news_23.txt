europe's digital clocks back to speed after grid operators fix lag
sarajevo

tardy
europeans
have
one
less
excuse
for
being
late
after
europe
s
power
network
operators
fixed
a
lag
of
nearly
six
minutes
in
digital
clocks
that
was
caused
by
a
power
grid
dispute
between
kosovo
and
serbia
digital
clocks
that
use
the
mains
frequency
in
an
electric
power
grid
to
keep
time
like
those
on
microwaves
and
clock
radios
began
falling
behind
earlier
this
year
when
the
frequency
in
europe
s
transmission
network
dropped
this
was
caused
by
a
power
shortage
lasting
from
to
march
after
kosovo
began
to
use
more
power
than
it
produced
and
serbia
which
is
in
charge
of
balancing
kosovo
s
grid
failed
to
fill
the
gap
the
european
network
of
transmission
system
operators
for
electricity
said
on
tuesday
that
of
its
members
had
carried
out
a
compensation
scheme
to
return
the
mains
frequency
across
europe
to
its
standard
of
hertz
hz
from
hz
said
that
to
do
so
the
grid
operators
had
put
more
energy
into
the
system
maintaining
an
average
electric
frequency
at
hz
during
march
one
of
the
effects
is
notably
that
the
digital
clocks
geared
by
electric
frequency
are
now
back
on
time
it
said
in
a
statement
serbia
and
kosovo
maintain
conflicting
claims
of
ownership
of
kosovo
s
power
grid
both
power
grids
are
synchronised
with
others
in
europe
said
it
would
continue
to
support
all
parties
in
finding
a
long
lasting
solution
to
energy
dispute
between
serbia
and
kosovo
kosovo
seceded
from
serbia
in
belgrade
which
still
refuses
to
recognise
kosovo
committed
to
normalise
ties
with
pristina
key
to
its
progress
towards
european
union
membership
but
little
progress
has
been
made
as
part
of
the
deal
both
countries
in
signed
an
agreement
on
operating
their
grids
but
it
has
never
been
enacted
as
they
maintain
conflicting
claims
about
ownership
of
the
power
grid
in
kosovo
serbs
in
the
north
of
kosovo
who
do
not
recognise
its
institutions
refuse
to
pay
their
electricity
bills
and
kosovo
s
grid
operator
kostt
says
that
the
serbian
counterpart
ems
obstructs
kostt
s
efforts
to
become
a
member
