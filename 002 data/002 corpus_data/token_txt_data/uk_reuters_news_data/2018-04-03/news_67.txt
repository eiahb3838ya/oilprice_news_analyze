sent
santos
shares
soaring
but
even
if

this

round
a

be
fraught
with
political
and
regulatory

lingering

that
come

definitely
in

said
the
plan
for
santos
was
one
of
growth
in
australia
papua
new

and
beyond
we
are
prepared
to
move
expeditiously
through
the
due
diligence
phase
to
immediately
begin
the
government
review
and
approval
process
cook
said
in
a
phone
interview
but
given
the
highly
politicized
nature
of
the
australian
domestic
gas
landscape
and
santos
key
role
there
analysts
and
investors
see
government
approval
as
a
key
risk
to
any
deal
a
takeover
would
be
subject
to
government
approvals
and
will
be
scrutinized
by
australia
s
foreign
investment
review
board
firb
which
provides
recommendations
to
the
government
cook
said
harbour
was
preparing
its
firb
application
santos
more
sensitive
assets
include
its
interest
in
the
gladstone

queensland
and
the
strategically
important
cooper
basin
in
the
country
s
east
where
significant
onshore
oil
and
gas
deposits

located
any
buyer
of
santos
would
need
to
be
prepared
for
ongoing
engagement
with
government
and
public
scrutiny
for
many
years
going
forward
said
saul
kavonic

wood
mackenzie
still
for
a
new
lng
player
santos
represents
an
attractive
target
given
its
portfolio
of
lng
assets
and
growth
options
according
to
analysts
the
santos
board
considers
that
based
on
the
indicative
offer
price
of
a
per
share
it
is
in
the
interests
of
shareholders
to
engage
further
with
harbour

reduction
and
have
led
it
back
to

as
a
result
santos
is
seen
to
be
able
to
produce
profitably
at
average
oil
costs
of
just
over
per
barrel
versus
actual
costs
of
around
a
barrel
the
company

focus
on

which
is
seen
to
be
a
bigger
growth
markets
in
coming
years
than
oil
is
also
seen
as
attractive
for
investors
harbour
plans
to
fund
the
takeover
