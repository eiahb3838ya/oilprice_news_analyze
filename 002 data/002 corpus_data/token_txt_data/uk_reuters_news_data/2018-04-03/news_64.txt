pressure
from

vietnam
and
china
have
been
embroiled
in
maritime

in
parts
of
the
busy
waterway
where
china
claims
percent
of
the
potentially
maritime
territory
which
vietnam
calls
the
east
sea
the
east
sea
is
forecast
to
continue
to
have
uncertainty
this
year
affecting
the
company
s
efforts
to
attract
foreign
investors
to
invest
in
its
open
offshore
fields
petrovietnam
said
on
its
website
petrovietnam
has
rarely
openly
admitted
that
the
tension
has
had
an
adverse
impact
on
its
offshore
exploration
and
production
fields
especially
those
located
near
the
line
that
marks
the
vast
area

the
south
china
sea
through
talks

for
the
healthy
and
sustainable
development
of
bilateral
relations
wang
said
in
its
statement
petrovietnam
said
the
dispute
with
china
would
add
to
its
struggle
to
maintain
crude
oil
output
amid
already
declining
production
from
vietnam
s
key
fields
last
month
it
ordered
spanish
energy
firm
repsol
to
suspend
its
red
emperor
project
off
vietnam

southeastern
coast
following
pressure
from
china
sources
told
reuters
the
billion
red
emperor
field
is
of
moderate
size
by
international
standards
but
was
seen
as
a
key
asset
to
help
slow
the
decline
of
vietnam
s
stalling
oil
and
gas
production
but
the
block
lies
near
china
s
line
and
overlaps
what
it
says
are
its
own
oil
concessions
vietnam
s
crude
oil
output
this
year
is
expected
to
fall
percent
from
last
year
to
million
metric
tonnes
or
barrels

day
