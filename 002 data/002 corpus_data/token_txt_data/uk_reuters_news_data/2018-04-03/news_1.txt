renewables
and
four
other
companies
have
joined
with
a
northern
california
power
provider
to
develop
the
first
offshore
wind
farm
to
boast
advanced
floating
turbines
the
group
said
in
a
statement
on
tuesday
the
redwood
coast
energy
authority
rcea
a
local
government
authority
that
provides
electricity
to
most
of
california
s
humboldt
county
solicited
bids
for
an
offshore
wind
project
earlier
this
year
because
it
is
seeking
to
generate
more
of
its
power
needs
locally
the
group
plans
to
submit
an
unsolicited
lease
application
to
the
federal
bureau
of
ocean
energy
management
in
may
or
june
of
this
year
said
lori
biondini
director
of
business
development
for
rcea
in
the
meantime
it
is
speaking
to
fishing
industry
and
department
of
defense
representatives
about
suitable
locations
for
the
wind
farm
the
wind
power
will
help
balance
out
the
large
amounts
of
solar
energy
consumed
in
rcea
s
territory
biondini
said
currently
rcea
sources
solar
from
southern
california
and
wind
energy
from
oregon
and
washington
humboldt
county
has
the
best
wind
resources
off
the
coast
of
california
the
group
said
in
a
statement
but
the
deep
water
along
its
coast
has
prevented
development
of
standard
fixed
offshore
wind
turbines
floating
wind
turbines
are
costly
and
have
not
been
deployed
widely
a
small
megawatt
floating
wind
farm
began
operating
off
the
coast
of
scotland
last
year
the
humboldt
county
project
is
expected
to
be
between
and

the
group
