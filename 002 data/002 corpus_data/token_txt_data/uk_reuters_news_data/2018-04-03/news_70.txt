asian
investors
have
looked
at
the
noise
recently

said
well
there
is
nothing
really
new
in

this

asian

were
mostly
in
the

technology

were
hit
hard
on
monday
after
president
donald
trump
attacked
over
the
pricing
of
its
deliveries
through
the
united
states
postal
service
and
promised
unspecified
changes
the
selling
added
to
what
has
been
a
rough
patch
for
technology
shares
this
year
facebook
apple
and
some
of
their
peers
had
a
woeful
last
quarter
as
investors
reassessed
high
stock
valuations
in
light
of
a
cocktail
of
negative
factors
so
called
fang
stocks
facebook
amazon
netflix
and
google
have
been
largely
responsible
for
a
bull
run
in
world
shares
although
the
threat
of
government
regulation
has
raised
worries
about
their
outlook
investors
were
also
on
the
backfoot
as
china
imposed
extra
tariffs
on
products
deepening
a
dispute
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
and
stoking
concerns
about
the
impact
on
global
growth
china
s
tariffs
hurt
the
dollar
although
it
saw
some
buying
during
early
asian
trading
on
tuesday
to
last
trade
at
yen
from
a
peak
of
the
dollar
index
was
still
a
shade
softer
against
a
basket
of
currencies
oil
prices
ticked
higher
after
falling
more
than
percent
on
monday
although
rising
russian
output
and
the
escalating
trade
dispute
still
weighed
