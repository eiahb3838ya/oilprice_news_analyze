world
markets
battled
to
regain
their
poise
on
tuesday
after
another
round
of
tech
and

worries
had
clobbered

tumbled

europe
s
main
markets
in
london
paris
and
frankfurt
were
all
down
more
than
percent
after
being
closed
on
monday
when
the
pace
of
selling
had
pushed
markets
below
pivotal
technical
levels
tech
stocks
remained
the
pressure
point
dropping
more
than
percent
after
more
criticism
of
amazon
by
president
donald
trump
and
as
reports
that
apple
intended
to
make
more
of
its
own

like

some
signs
of
stability
were
emerging
though
wall
street
futures
pointed
higher
the
dollar
steadied
against
the
yen
after
three
days
of
decline
and
gold
and
government
bonds
were
in
reverse
there
is
actually
very
little
contagion
from
all
the
equity
market
moves
that
are
grabbing
all
the
headlines

asia
s
shares
had
stumbled
overnight
too
although
less
than
wall
street
where
the
s
p
closed
below
its
moving
average
for
the
first
time
since
britain
s
vote
to
leave
the
european
union
as
well
as
the
tech
problems
investors
were
also
wary
after
china
imposed
extra
tariffs
on
products
deepening
a
dispute
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
and
stoking
concerns
about
the
impact
on
global
growth
japan
s
nikkei
ended
down
percent
after
falling
as
much
as

treasuries
german

and

gilts
all
saw
a
bit
of
selling
with
yields
on
notes
off
to
lows
the
big
question
is
how
far
the
current
tremor
in
the
equity
market
will
affect
bonds
given
it
is
driven
by
a
single
company
even
if
it
is
a
tech
giant
having
a
huge

fallen
more

after
news
of
rising

and
the
