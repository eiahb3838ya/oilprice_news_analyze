this
spring
the
questions
came
from
new
york
state
comptroller
thomas
dinapoli
who
last
year
led
a
campaign
that
convinced
a
majority
of
exxon
shareholders
to
call
on
the
company
to
detail
risks
it
could
face
from
rising
global
temperatures
exxon
produced
a
report
in
february
outlining
how
global
oil
demand
could
drop
sharply
by
but
critics
said
the
report
fell
short
on
areas
like
how

tried
to
placate

such
as
how

compare
to
national
policy
goals
or
if
exxon
considers
emissions
standards
in
projections
for
fuel
demand
in
the
letter
doherty
wrote
that
his
office
needs
answers
for
a
full
understanding
of
exxon
mobil
s
planning
and
preparation
to
operate
in
a
carbon
constrained
economy
and
in

said
on
tuesday
it
asked
other
companies
including
