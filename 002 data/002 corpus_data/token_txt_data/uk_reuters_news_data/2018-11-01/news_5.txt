triggered

at
tokyo
electric

s
fukushima
daiichi
plant
the
battered
industry
is
making
a
quiet
and
somewhat
unexpected
return
in
japan
ikata
is
a
poster
child
for
that
recovery
in
september
a
court
reversed
a
decision
that
had
idled
shikoku
electric
s
sole
nuclear
reactor
for
about
a
year
paving
the
way
for
the
operator
to
the
facility
last
week
regional
utilities
like
shikoku
electric
have
aggressively
fought
a
string
of
lawsuits
since
hiring
veteran
lawyers
to
beef
up
their
legal
teams
at
the
same
time
they
wooed
towns
where
nuclear
plants
are
based
visiting
with
residents
door
to
door
while
the
government
kept
up
a
stream
of
generous
subsidies
for
local
projects
thanks
in
large
part
to
this
strategy
japan
is
on
track
to
have
nine
reactors
running
in
the
near
future
that
is
a
far
cry
from
the
running
before
all
of
which
were
idled
after
the
fukushima
disaster
but
more
than
analysts
and
experts
expected
considering
it
seemed
at
the
time
like
the
end
of
the
road
for
the
country
s
nuclear
industry
a
reuters
analysis
calculates
that
as
few
as
six
more
reactors
are
likely
to
restart
within
the
next
five
years
eight
will
mostly
likely
be
mothballed
and
that
the
prospects
for
two
dozen
others
is
uncertain
despite
that
cloudy
outlook
nuclear
power
recently
overtook
renewables
like
wind
and
solar
in
japan
s
energy
mix
for
the
first
time
since
fukushima
japan
embraced
nuclear
power
after
world
war
ii
spurred
by
the
promise
of
clean
energy
and
independence
from
foreign
suppliers
but
the
botched
fukushima
disaster
response
sowed
public
distrust
in
the
industry
and
the
government
given
that
scepticism
some
see
a
recent
run
of
court
victories
by
utilities
as
the
resurgence
of
an
alliance
of
industry
government
and
host
communities
that
for
decades
promoted
the
construction
of
nuclear
facilities
if
our
losing
streak
continues
we
could
see
to
reactors
come
back
online
says
hiroyuki
kawai
a
prominent
lawyer
who
represented
citizens
in
a
suit
against
shikoku
electric
since
hundreds
of
citizens
represented
by
volunteer
lawyers
like
kawai
have
filed
nearly
lawsuits
against
the
japanese
government
and
utilities
in
district
and
appellate
courts
in
ikata
shikoku
electric
spent
months
gaining
approval
for
a
restart
from
the
tougher
regulator
rebooting
one
of
its
plant
s
three
reactors
in
but
in
december
an
appellate
court
issued
a
temporary
injunction
keeping
the
reactor
already
idled
for
routine
maintenance
shut
down
for
nine
more
months
in
response
the
company
pulled
more
staff
into
its
legal
department
and
drafted
its
head
of
nuclear
power
to
supervise
the
team
the
utility
also
recruited
outside
lawyers
who
had
handled
cases
for
other
operators
there
are
only
a
handful
of
lawyers
knowledgeable
about
nuclear
litigation
so
they
re
popular
and
sought
after
said
kenji
sagawa
the
deputy
general
manager
of
the
company
s
tokyo
office
yoshiaki
yamanouchi
began
his
career
in
nuclear
litigation
in
when
he
represented
shikoku
electric
in
a
landmark
suit
brought
by
ikata
residents
seeking
to
stop
the
plant
from
opening
he
still
represents
the
utility
and
works
with
other
companies
advising
younger
lawyers
fighting
similar
cases
which
he
calls
superficial
in
district
courts
utilities
in
particular
shikoku
have
gotten
much
smarter
about
fighting
for
the
plants
they
know
they
can
reopen
and
mothballing
others
that
would
cost
too
much
time
and
money
yamanouchi
said
the
utility
is
decommissioning
two
of
the
three
reactors
at
ikata
shikoku
electric
would
not
disclose
how
much
it
has
spent
fighting
legal
challenges
but
said
it
was
a
fraction
of
the
cost
of
idling
a
plant
every
month
a
nuclear
reactor
sits
inoperative
the
utility
spends
billion
yen
million
for
additional
fuel
at
its
conventional
power
plants
shikoku
has
also
spent
billion
yen
on
safety
upgrades
to
meet
stricter
rules
set
by
the
nuclear
regulation
authority
activists
have
seen
some
victories
western
japan
s
kansai
electric
power
co
inc
has
had
its
reactors
slapped
with
temporary
injunction
orders
multiple
times
over
the
years
all
of
these
decisions
were
later
overturned
by
higher
courts
before
fukushima
these
utilities
won
by
default
now
they
have
to
work
harder
said
yuichi
kaido
a
lawyer
who
has
spent
three
decades
duelling
yamanouchi
in
court
shikoku
electric
still
faces
several
lawsuits
and
injunction
requests
a
hiroshima
court
rejected
a
request
from
residents
to
extend
the
suspension
of
the
ikata
reactor
on
a
day
before
the
operator
restarted
it
the
quiet
revival
of
japan
s
nuclear
industry
is
most
tangible
in
rural
areas
like
ikata
which
are
home
to
the
bulk
of
the
country
s
nuclear
plants
ikata
is
best
known
for
its
mikan
mandarin
oranges
harvested
on
terrace
farms
on
the
sides
of
steep
hills
overlooking
the
seto
inland
sea
and
uwa
sea
the
town
with
residents
relies
on
nuclear
power
for
a
third
of
its
annual
revenue
since
ikata
has
received
more
than
billion
yen
million
in
such
payments
these
funds
literally
built
the
town
ikata
s
roads
schools
hospitals
fire
stations
and
even
five
traditional
taiko
drums
for
festivals
were
all
paid
for
with
subsidies
my
biggest
struggle
now
is
finding
one
or
two
more
pillars
for
this
town
other
than
nuclear
power
said
ikata
mayor
kiyohiko
takakado
the
town
and
utility
s
mutual
dependence
stretch
back
decades
kiyokichi
nakamoto
was
a
city
councilman
in
ikata
when
he
successfully
wooed
the
utility
to
his
hometown
on
the
walls
of
the
dim
parlour
of
his
home
are
framed
commendations
from
two
prime
ministers
thanking
him
for
his
contributions
to
japan
s
energy
policy
we
were
a
poor
village
with
only
farming
and
fishing
the
old
said
had
the
town
failed
to
attract
the
plant
ikata
would
have
gone
broke
nakamoto
said
in
the
wake
of
the
fukushima
disaster
shikoku
electric
campaigned
to
reassure
residents
of
their
plant
s
safety
employees
wearing
the
company
s
blue
uniforms
went
from
house
to
house
to
explain
how
their
plant
was
different
from
fukushima
daiichi
and
therefore
safe
if
something
like
fukushima
happened
here
our
reputation
would
be
destroyed
in
an
instant
said
orange
farmer
shigeto
suka
as
he
checked
the
mikan
on
branches
he
and
other
farmers
in
yawatahama
a
neighbouring
town
kilometres
miles
from
the
plant
worry
that
even
a
hint
of
contamination
would
devastate
their
brand
after
the
nuclear
disaster
fukushima
s
farmers
and
fishermen
were
unable
to
sell
their
produce
because
of
fears
over
contaminated
food
dozens
of
countries
still
have
restrictions
on
fukushima
produce
for
others
in
the
area
the
ikata
plant
feels
like
an
inextricable
part
of
life
hiroshi
omori
spent
most
days
over
the
summer
at
shikoku
electric
s
visitors
house
overlooking
the
ikata
plant
his
three
young
children
take
free
art
classes
there
while
omori
and
other
parents
wait
in
rooms
sipping
water
and
tea
but
ikata
is
projected
to
shrink
to
residents
over
the
next
years
and
takakado
recently
said
he
found
it
hard
to
imagine
an
industry
that
could
replace
nuclear
power
this
year
he
joined
dozens
of
other
mayors
across
japan
to
voice
their
support
for
the
industry
and
ask
the
government
to
clarify
its
position
on
building
new
plants
or
replacing
old
ones
i
m
just
trying
to
prevent
the
town
from
losing
even
more
people
