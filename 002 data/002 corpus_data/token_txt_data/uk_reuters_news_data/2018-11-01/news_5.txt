reuters summit-shell canada sees cost advantage in lng canada expansion
calgary

reuters
an
expansion
of
lng
canada
has
a
cost
advantage
over
its
rivals
in
the
race
to
build
more
liquefied
natural
gas
export
capacity
but
a
decision
on
phase
two
is
likely
still
a
few
years
away
shell
canada
s
president
said
on
thursday
the
first
phase
of
the
c
billion
billion
royal
dutch
shell
project
was
given
the
last
month
firing
up
a
race
among
companies
eager
to
be
the
next
to
tap
into
booming
asian
demand
for
the
gas
that
is
supercooled
into
liquid
form
for
export
by
tanker
what
s
in
our
favor
now
is
expansions
are
typically
lower
capital
cost
michael
crothers
shell
canada
president
told
the
reuters
global
commodities
summit
i
think
that
opens
up
an
even
more
competitive
opportunity
for
us
and
the
that
expansion
cost
saving
adds
onto
the
project
s
other
advantages
including
a
relatively
short
shipping
distance
to
key
asian
markets
and
cheap
feed
gas
the
question
of
when
the
second
phase
which
would
double
output
at
the
million
tonne
per
annum
mtpa
plant
to
mtpa
will
be
approved
remains
unclear
crothers
said
i
m
sure
shell
leadership
would
like
to
see
demonstrated
performance
before
we
start
to
consider
this
too
closely
so
that
s
still
probably
a
few
years
away
he
said
he
added
an
lng
canada
expansion
would
have
to
compete
with
global
rivals
including
options
in
the
africa
and
middle
east
and
would
depend
on
the
market
for
the
fuel
though
all
signs
point
to
sustained
asian
demand
lng
demand
has
risen
sharply
in
recent
years
led
by
china
gobbling
up
an
anticipated
surplus
and
fanning
fears
of
a
shortage
by
decade
this
has
projects
around
the
world
scrambling
to
secure
the
deals
they
need
to
finance
dollar
builds
lng
canada
is
a
joint
venture
between
shell
malaysia
s
petronas
petrochina
co
ltd
mitsubishi
corp
and
korea
gas
corp
one
of
the
key
benefits
for
lng
projects
is
access
to
cheap
gas
crothers
said
noting
that
western
canadian
gas
prices
are
roughly
less
than
the
henry
hub
benchmark
and
are
not
expected
to
rise
anytime
soon
gas
prices
are
so
low
that
shell
has
stopped
drilling
new
wells
at
its
massive
groundbirch
field
in
northern
british
columbia
and
will
only
resume
in
to
ready
for
lng
canada
shipments
crothers
also
sees
a
advantage
domestically
on
labor
costs
noting
that
a
construction
slowdown
in
alberta
s
oil
sands
is
allowing
lng
canada
good
access
to
skilled
workers
shell
pulled
back
from
the
oil
sands
last
year
and
has
focused
on
the
duvernay
and
montney
shale
formations
which
produce
mainly
light
oils
and
natural
gas
the
market
for
that
light
oil
known
as
condensate
is
booming
as
oil
sand
producers
use
it
as
a
diluent
to
run
their
heavy
crude
through
pipelines
the
risk
is
that
heavy
oil
producers
could
cut
output
in
response
to
low
prices
if
oil
sands
plays
decline
or
people
shut
in
production
then
the
demand
for
local
condensate
could
drop
and
that
will
impact
the
price
said
crothers
for
now
shell
s
alberta
light
tight
oil
assets
remain
one
of
the
top
areas
of
unconventional
spending
for
the
company
but
crothers
noted
that
an
unfavorable
tax
situation
is
hurting
its
competiveness
globally
the
performance
of
wells
continues
to
look
very
encouraging
costs
continue
to
come
down
he
said
it
would
be
helpful
if
there
was
a
better
competitive
story
canada
when
it
comes
to
the
crothers
also
said
shell
canada
is
open
to
acquisitions
in
key
shale
regions
but
declined
to
comment
on
any
specific
opportunities
