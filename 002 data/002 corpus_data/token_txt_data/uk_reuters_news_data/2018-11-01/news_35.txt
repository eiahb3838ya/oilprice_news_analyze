eex
group
board
member

ore
and
fuel
oil
to
get
a
foothold
in
asia
which
is
by
far
the
world
s
biggest
and
fastest
growing
commodity
and
energy
market
last
year
eex
bought
power
and
natural
gas
bourse
nodal
exchange
the
acquisition
of
cltx
was
the
first
step
then
last
year
nodal
was
the
next
step
laege
told
the
reuters
global
commodities
summit
series
of
interviews
that
takes
place
this
week
eex
group
will
also
operate
cleartech
out
of
singapore
as
a
platform
handling
support
for
commodities
traded
outside
exchanges
known
as
otc
markets
eex
asia
will
initially
focus
on
expanding
its
freight
offerings
it
s
the
freight
market
we
find
most
interesting
especially
in
asia
it
s
a
key
facilitator
for
global
trade
and
there
s
a
huge
overlap
of
asian
and
european
freight
clients
he
said
speaking
to
reuters
while
attending
the
singapore
international
energy
week
siew
the
next
step
will
be
iron
growing
its
business
will
put
eex
asia
in
competition
with
the
dominant
bourse
in
this
field
the
baltic
exchange
which
was
bought
by
singapore
exchange
sgx
in
in
some
of
our
offerings
we
will
be
competing
with
sgx
s
offerings
for
sure
said
laege
in
europe
eex
started
off
as
an
electricity
exchange
before
branching
out
into
the
main
fossil
fuels
that
fire
power
stations
thermal
coal
and
natural
gas
while
it
has
established
some
links
in
asia
including
early
product
design
projects
with
the
japan
electric
power
exchange
jepx
laege
said
electricity
was
not
a
priority
for
eex
asia
at
this
stage
as
an
exchange
you
can
not
a
market
there
needs
to
be
a
threshold
market
size
and
liquidity
first
and
in
asia
s
power
and
gas
markets
we
re
not
quite
there
this
was
also
the
case
for
the
booming
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
market
while
it
is
true
that
lng
demand
is
growing
you
have
a
lack
of
standardized
delivery
contracts
laege
said
with
higher
standardization
a
prerequisite
for
an
lng
exchange
product
despite
some
attempts
to
chance
the
status
quo
it
will
have
to
be
seen
whether
you
ll
ever
have
such
standardization
in
asian
lng
as
you
have
in
and
european
natural
gas
markets
