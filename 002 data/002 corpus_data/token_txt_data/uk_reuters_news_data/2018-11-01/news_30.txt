a
protracted
drought

have
lowered

the
current

flow
at
the

is
about
to
beat
record
lows
recorded
in
to
the
worst
ever
since
the
opening

in
eps
said
the
main
reasons
are
poor
water
levels
on
all
watercourses
not
only
in
serbia
but
elsewhere
throughout
the
region
it
said
an
electricity
trader
told
reuters
that
hydropower
output
in
serbia
fell
by
around
percent
and
the
trend
was
similar
in
neighboring
bosnia

croatian
power
exchanges
have
risen
more
than
percent

power
utilities
across

and
especially
in

eps
said
its
total
daily
output
including

was
around

kwh
and
that
it
was
supplementing
it
with
daily
purchases
of
million
kwh
from
other
sources
demand
from

also
drove
power
prices
higher

another

despite
forecasts
for

the
water
levels
at
the

would
not
rebound
as
fast

the
croatian
service
said
as
a
result
the
power
prices
are
forecast
to
remain
at
similar
levels
in

probably
the

the

warned
low

will
become
worse
