magellan
midstream
partners
lp
on
thursday
became
the
latest
company
to
join
a
crowded
group
looking
to
build
an
oil
export
terminal
on
the
gulf
coast
designed
to
load
supertankers
oil
exports
are
expanding
rapidly
but
volumes
are
constrained
because
the
country
s
shores
have
limited
capability
to
load
giant
vessels
that
can
carry
about
million
barrels
of
crude
oil
numerous
companies
including
private
equity
firm
carlyle
group
and
commodities
merchant
trafigura
and
other
pipeline
operators
have
already
announced
proposals
in
what
is
quickly
becoming
a
crowded
field
of
those
looking
to
finance
and
break
ground
on
a
project
currently
the
united
states
unlike
top
exporters
such
as
saudi
arabia
has
limited
capacity
to
fully
load
very
large
crude
carriers
or
vlccs
forcing
companies
to
do
transfers
in
deep
waters
which
is
costly
and
inefficient
magellan
said
it
is
considering
a
potential
export
terminal
on
harbor
island
in
corpus
christi
texas
capable
of
loading
vlccs
earlier
this
week
carlyle
said
it
was
looking
to
build
in
partnership
with
the
port
of
corpus
christi
which
would
need
substantial
dredging
to
deepen
its
waterways
other
texas
and
louisiana
projects
have
been
proposed
by
companies
including
trafigura
ag
and
pipeline
operators
enterprise
products
partners
lp
and
tallgrass
energy
lp
to
be
sure
magellan
warned
that
it
would
take
considerable
time
before
a
final
decision
on
the
project
is
made
it
s
very
competitive
we
ve
got
significant
interest
to
date
but
we
ll
see
how
it
plays
out
said
chief
executive
michael
mears
crude
production
hit
a
record
million
bpd
in
august
and
exports
surged
to
as
much
as
million
bpd
in
june
magellan
also
said
the
total
cost
of
its
proposed
crude
oil
pipeline
from
the
permian
basin
in
west
texas
to
the
gulf
coast
is
expected
to
be
about
billion
with
magellan
s
share
being
about
million
permian
production
has
outpaced
pipeline
capacity
prompting
several
new
lines
to
be
announced
separately
magellan
said
volumes
on
the
bridgetex
pipeline
which
moves
crude
from
midland
and
colorado
city
texas
to
east
houston
averaged
over
bpd
during
the
third
quarter
compared
with
about
bpd
a
year
earlier
