u.s. iran policy depends not just on sanctions but on flexibility
washington
reuters
as
president
donald
trump
resumes
sanctions
on
iran
the
success
of
his
push
to
curb
its
nuclear
missile
and
regional
activities
may
hinge
on
how
flexible
he
is
willing
to
be
on
his
extensive
demands
to
coax
tehran
into
talks
washington
will
reintroduce
sanctions
on
monday
targeting
iran
s
most
important
industry
oil
and
officials
have
indicated
a
measure
of
flexibility
is
needed
to
ensure
global
markets
are
well
supplied
to
keep
prices
from
surging
in
abandoning
the
international
iran
nuclear
deal
trump
and
his
top
aides
have
touted
the
of
economic
penalties
on
iran
as
part
of
a
maximum
pressure
campaign
to
force
a
change
in
a
wide
range
of
iranian
behaviour
what
trump
wants
from
tehran
though
is
seen
by
former
officials
as
a
maximalist
position
that
includes
ending
uranium
enrichment
giving
inspectors
access
to
all
sites
across
iran
and
ceasing
support
for
hezbollah
in
lebanon
houthis
in
yemen
and
the
hamas
palestinian
militant
group
on
may
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
listed
demands
that
also
covered
iran
ending
development
of
missiles
withdrawing
forces
under
its
command
in
syria
and
ceasing
threatening
acts
toward
its
neighbours
they
are
maximalist
demands
and
no
iranian
government
would
be
willing
or
able
to
accept
them
said
robert
einhorn
a
former
official
now
at
the
brookings
institution
trump
wants
iran
s
government
to
capitulate
or
collapse
einhorn
said
they
are
not
going
to
knuckle
under
he
said
but
if
the
administration
began
to
signal
some
flexibility
it
s
possible
the
iranian
regime
would
agree
to
enter
into
such
flexibility
could
include
signalling
that
iran
might
limit
but
not
eliminate
uranium
enrichment
and
that
it
might
allow
for
greater
inspections
than
in
the
deal
if
not
the
inspections
washington
wants
the
sanctions
resuming
on
monday
include
those
aimed
to
force
iran
s
oil
customers
such
as
china
india
and
turkey
to
cut
their
oil
purchases
ideally
to
zero
though
the
white
house
appears
to
recognise
that
is
unrealistic
we
want
to
achieve
maximum
pressure
but
we
don
t
want
to
harm
friends
and
allies
either
white
house
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
said
on
wednesday
in
a
hint
washington
may
grant
exceptions
to
these
sanctions
for
countries
that
significantly
reduce
their
purchases
from
iran
another
penalty
would
be
to
blacklist
roughly
two
dozen
previously
sanctioned
iranian
banks
which
may
get
the
swift
financial
messaging
system
to
disconnect
them
further
inhibiting
iran
s
trade
with
the
world
when
he
abandoned
the
iran
nuclear
deal
trump
promised
to
impose
the
highest
level
of
economic
sanction
on
iran
saying
this
would
make
them
want
a
new
pact
when
they
do
i
am
ready
willing
and
able
he
said
a
central
impediment
to
any
negotiation
is
the
lack
of
trust
given
trump
s
abrogation
of
the
agreement
and
the
iranian
belief
that
his
real
aim
despite
denials
is
to
bring
down
its
government
richard
nephew
a
former
official
now
at
columbia
university
summed
up
tehran
s
stance
on
talks
as
why
bother
iran
was
more
likely
to
try
to
evade
and
resist
sanctions
taking
a
position
of
if
we
are
going
to
go
down
at
least
we
won
t
go
down
on
our
knees
we
re
going
to
die
standing
up
nephew
said
iran
may
try
to
survive
the
shrinking
oil
revenues
for
two
years
to
see
if
trump
is
and
then
decide
on
talks
they
will
be
averse
to
doing
so
from
a
position
of
abject
weakness
said
jon
alterman
a
former
official
now
at
the
center
for
strategic
and
international
studies
before
talking
iran
would
likely
increase
support
for
regional
proxies
or
conduct
missile
tests
to
create
chips
it
could
concede
in
a
negotiation
if
i
had
to
bet
all
these
things
will
happen
the
will
tighten
the
screws
the
iranians
will
do
more
things
that
are
worrying
to
the
trump
administration
and
the
two
sides
will
talk
