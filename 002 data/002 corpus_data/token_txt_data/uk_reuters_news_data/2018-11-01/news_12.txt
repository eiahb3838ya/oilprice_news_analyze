reuters summit-mercuria says oil near $70 is litmus test for producer strategy
london
reuters
the
world
s
largest
oil
producers
could
reverse
their
strategy
of
raising
output
and
revert
to
reduction
mode
if
the
price
of
crude
holds
near
a
barrel
into
next
year
mercuria
chief
executive
marco
dunand
said
on
thursday
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
together
with
russia
oman
and
others
embarked
on
a
strategy
in
of
cutting
output
to
drain
a
vast
overhang
of
global
oil
inventories
and
prop
up
the
price
if
we
start
moving
into
the
low
on
brent
i
think
some
of
those
producers
will
start
asking
themselves
whether
they
haven
t
overreacted
to
the
earlier
price
rally
and
start
considering
balances
dunand
told
the
reuters
global
commodities
summit
they
ve
spent
the
past
three
years
bringing
inventories
down
to
more
historical
levels
is
there
going
to
be
enough
cohesion
among
them
to
curtail
production
again
the
producers
plan
worked
to
the
extent
that
the
price
of
a
barrel
of
oil
rose
to
a
peak
around
a
barrel
in
early
october
from
less
than
in
while
global
inventories
fell
to
opec
s
target
with
the
impending
loss
of
anything
up
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
iranian
crude
exports
because
of
sanctions
opec
led
by
saudi
arabia
has
pledged
to
raise
output
to
prevent
the
gap
between
supply
and
demand
from
becoming
too
tight
sanctions
come
into
force
from
the
price
has
slipped
to
around
in
recent
weeks
thanks
largely
to
concerns
over
the
impact
to
demand
growth
from
an
escalating
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
while
inventories
worldwide
have
begun
to
swell
again
mercuria
trades
more
than
million
bpd
of
oil
and
together
with
rivals
vitol
trafigura
and
gunvor
ships
billions
of
tonnes
of
commodities
between
the
world
s
producers
and
consumers
because
of
trade
tensions
and
a
number
of
other
factors
such
as
a
bit
of
exuberance
on
other
fronts
there
is
plenty
of
risk
that
demand
growth
will
not
be
a
strong
as
originally
anticipated
dunand
said
if
you
put
it
all
together
the
chances
are
that
we
are
going
to
be
building
