new
york
reuters
oil
fell
nearly
percent
on
thursday
with
crude
futures
hitting
lows
not
seen
since
april
due
to
growing
concerns
that
global
demand
is
weakening
at
a
time
when
output
from
the
world
s
major
oil
producers
is
surging
record
production
from
the
united
states
and
russia
along
with
a
big
move
upward
in
output
from
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
has
culminated
in
a
move
to
the
exits
by
speculators
oil
has
also
been
under
pressure
on
growing
concern
over
a
possible
slowdown
in
global
growth
as
the
trade
dispute
remains
unresolved
and
is
starting
to
hit
emerging
market
economies
in
particular
crude
prices
are
percent
below
highs
reached
in
early
october
analysts
said
they
anticipate
more
selling
in
coming
days
noting
that
oil
was
unable
to
capitalize
on
weakness
in
the
dollar
on
thursday
nor
did
it
benefit
from
a
rebound
in
equity
markets
the
sellers
seem
to
be
in
charge

brent
crude
futures
settled
down
or
percent
at
a
barrel
while
crude
lost
or
percent
at
its
lowest
close
since
april
the
declines
accelerated
on
thursday
after
futures
broke
through
which
had
served
as
a
buying
level
throughout
the
spring
and
summer
more
than
million
contracts
changed
hands
exceeding
the
moving
average
of
million
contracts
a
day
as
we
drop
down
we
see
additional
liquidation
from
speculators
and
that
keeps
things
heading
south
said
jim
ritterbusch
president
of
ritterbusch
associates
both
benchmarks
posted
their
biggest
monthly
percentage
decline
since
july
in
october
with
brent
down
percent
for
the
month
and
crude
losing
nearly
percent
on
wednesday
the
energy
department
said
overall
crude
output
hit
a
record
million
barrels
per
day
in
august
and
it
is
expected
to
keep
growing
russia
is
producing
million
bpd
and
a
reuters
survey
of
opec
production
showed
that
group
pumping
out
more
oil
daily
since
the
flood
of
oil
is
overwhelming
any
lingering
worries
that
the
market
would
be
unable
to
offset
further
expected
declines
in
exports
out
of
iran
when
renewed
sanctions
take
effect
next
week
the
increase
in
opec
production
has
really
started
to
tamp
down
concerns
surrounding
the
loss
of
iranian
barrels

mcgillian
said
china
s
manufacturing
sector
in
october
expanded
at
its
weakest
pace
in
over
two
years
hurt
by
slowing
domestic
and
external
demand
in
a
sign
of
deepening
cracks
in
the
economy
from
the
trade
war
with
the
united
states
oil
investors
are
now
betting
on
the
potential
of
a
global
slowdown
