asian
stocks
rose
on

as
bruised
investor
sentiment
got
some
relief
from
another
robust
wall
street
session
thanks
to
upbeat
corporate
earnings
while
the
dollar
hovered
near
a
high
on
further

msci
s

index
of
shares
outside
japan
rose
percent
adding
to
modest
gains
the
previous
day
though
this
came
after
a
brutal
october
month
the
index
had
fallen
percent
in
october
it
worst
monthly
performance
since
august
as
factors
ranging
from
trade
tensions
to
worries
about
global
economic
growth
higher
interest
rates
and
company
earnings
spurred
volatility
in
global
markets
there
were
tentative
signs
of
the
gloom
slowly
beginning
to
lift
led
by
a
rebound
in
shares
wall
street
rose
for
a
second
day
on
wednesday
as
strong
company
results
and
bargain
hunting
of
technology
and
internet
favourites
lifted
spirits
the
improved
mood
filtered
down
to
asia
with
australian
stocks
up
percent
and
south
korea
s
kospi
putting
on
percent
japan
s
nikkei
slipped
percent
following
two
days
of
big
gains
what
we
are
seeing
is
the
equity
markets
trying
to
rebound
after
bottoming
out
corporate
earnings
in
the
and
japanese
markets
have
been
relatively
strong
on
the
whole
which
means
there
are
plenty
of
bargain
hunting
opportunities
said
soichiro
monji
senior
economist
at
daiwa
sb
investments
in
tokyo
the
ongoing
rebound
has
further
room
to
go
the
trade
conflict
will
continue
popping
up
as
a
market
factor
going
forward
but
the
worst
fears
appear
to
have
subsided
for
now
at
least
through
the
midterm
the
dollar
index
against
a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
hovered
near
a
high
of
scaled
overnight
after
the
adp
national
employment
report
showed
that
private
sector
payrolls
increased
by
the
most
in
eight
months
in
october
the
greenback
has
enjoyed
a
boost
from
robust
economic
reports
including
data
last
week
which
showed
the
economy
slowed
less
than
expected
in
the
third
quarter
the
euro
on
the
other
hand
has
been
weighed
by
economic
news
from
the
euro
zone
region
the
single
currency
stood
at
after
retreating
to
on
wednesday
its
lowest
since
the
pound
rose
percent
to
after
the
times
reported
that
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
had
sealed
a
deal
with
brussels
that
would
give
british
financial
serves
companies
continued
access
to
european
markets
after
brexit
the
bounce
lifted
the
pound
further
away
from
a
low
struck
on
tuesday
in
commodities
crude

down

at

the
benchmark
remained
on
the
back
foot
after
falling
more
than
from
a
peak
reached
early
in

as
the
