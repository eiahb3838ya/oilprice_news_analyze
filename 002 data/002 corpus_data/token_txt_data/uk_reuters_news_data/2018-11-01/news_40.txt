of

rose
percent
adding

the

though
this
came
after
a
brutal
october
month
the
index
had
fallen
percent
in
october
its
worst
monthly
performance
since
august
as
factors
ranging
from
trade
tensions
to
worries
about
global
economic
growth
higher
interest
rates
and
company
earnings
spurred
volatility
in
global

slowly
beginning

lift
led
by
a
rebound
in
shares
wall
street
rose
for
a
second
day
on
wednesday
as
strong
company

filtered
down

percent
japan
s

bucked
the
trend
and

percent
following
two
days
of
big

what
we
are
seeing
is
the
equity
markets
trying
to
rebound
after
bottoming
out
corporate
earnings
in
the
and
japanese
markets
have
been
relatively
strong
on
the
whole
which
means
there
are
plenty
of
bargain
hunting
opportunities
said
soichiro
monji
senior
economist
at
daiwa
sb
investments
in
tokyo
the
ongoing
rebound
has
further
room
to
go
the
trade
conflict
will
continue
popping
up
as
a
market
factor
going
forward
but
the
worst
fears
appear
to
have
subsided
for
now
at
least
through
the
midterm
the
pound
surged
percent
to
after
the
times
reported
that
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
had
sealed
a
deal
with
brussels
that
would
give
british
financial
services
companies
continued
access
to
european
markets
after
brexit
the
bounce
lifted
the
pound
dented
recently
on
worries
over
whether
britain
could
secure
an
orderly
exit
from
the
european
union
further
away
from
a
low
struck
on
tuesday
sterling
s
rally
nudged
the
dollar
off
its
recent
peak
an
index
which
measures
the
currency
s
strength
against
a
basket
of
six
major

was
down
percent
at
the
dollar
index
had
spiked
to
a
high
of
overnight
on
a
adp
national
employment
report
which
showed
that
private
sector
payrolls
increased
by
the
most
in
eight
months
in
october
the
greenback
has
recently
enjoyed
a
boost
from
robust
economic
reports
including
data
last
week
which
showed
the
economy
slowed
less
than
expected
in
the
third
quarter
for
now
we
think
that
the
strength
of
the
economy
and
still
stimulatory
financial
conditions
will
see
the
fed
continue
its
tightening
path
despite
growing
external
vulnerabilities
wrote
economists
at
anz
in
this
context
it
s
possible
that
higher
yields
in
combination
with
slowing
emerging
market
growth
may
continue
to
weigh
on
emerging
markets
the
fed
is
not
about
to
come
to
the
rescue

financial
markets

a

retreating
to

wednesday
its
lowest

the

been
weighed
by

the

strong

the
concerns

china
s
yuan
strengthened
a
touch
to

in

after
a
firmer

by
the
central
bank

it
was
still
not

off
a

the
previous

the

china
on
wednesday
said
it
will
issue
