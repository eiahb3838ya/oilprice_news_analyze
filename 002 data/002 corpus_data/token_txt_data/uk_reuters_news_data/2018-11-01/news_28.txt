column-u.s. oil output surges but growth likely to moderate in 2019: john kemp

crude
oil
production
is
rising
at
the
fastest
rate
on
record
as
the
increase
in
prices
over
the
last
year
boosts
drilling
and
completion
activity
and
energy
firms
employ
more
horsepower
to
fracture

crude
output
has
increased
by
more
than
million
barrels

nearly
percent

oil
production
is
now
rising
faster
than
at
the
height
of
the
last
drilling
and
fracking
boom
before
prices
slumped
in
the
second
half
of
most
of
the
increase
is
coming
from
onshore
shale
fields
where
output
has
risen
by
more
than
million
bpd
over
the
last
year
with
a
smaller
contribution
from
the
gulf

is
up
bpd
in
the
first
nine

of

the

report

increasing
output
has
helped
alleviate
earlier
concerns
about
a
possible
crude
shortage
following
the
of
sanctions
on
iran
with
effect
from
surging
domestic
output
coupled
with
increased
production
from
russia
saudi
arabia
and
a
number
of
other
opec
countries
has
pushed
oil
prices
lower
and
driven
the
futures
markets
back
towards
contango
spot
prices
and
calendar
spreads
for
wti
have
weakened
rapidly
since
july
much
further
and
faster
than
for
brent
in
response
to
the
improved
availability
of
crude
in
the
midcontinent
of
the
united
states
wti
calendar
spreads
are
trading
around
cents
contango
compared
with
a
backwardation
of
more
than
per
barrel
in
july
as
traders
become
more
confident
about
availability
but
the
accompanying
increase
in
domestic
inventories
and
crude
exports
has
ensured
weakness
in
inland
wti
has
begun
to
bleed
into
the
seaborne
crude
market
and
started
to
pull
down
brent
prices
too
experience
suggests
there
is
an
average
delay
of
around
months
between
a
change
in
futures
prices
and
the
number
of
rigs
drilling
for
oil
completions
take
an
extra
six
months
or
so
giving
a
total
lag
from
futures
price
changes
to
production
of
roughly
months
the
surge
in
production
reported
in
the
first
eight
months
of
the
year
is
therefore
the
lagged
effect
of
the
sharp
rise
in
oil
prices
during
the
second
half
of
and
early
but
benchmark
futures
prices
have
levelled
off
since
april
and
wellhead
prices
have
softened
significantly
as
a
result
of
insufficient
pipeline
takeaway
capacity
in
west
texas
the
number
of
rigs
drilling
for
oil
was
basically
flat
between
the
end
of
may
and
the
end
of
september
which
is
likely
to
lead
to
a
slowdown
in
production
growth
by
the
second
and
third
quarters
of
the
energy
information
administration
forecasts
average
crude
and
condensates
production
will
rise
by
just
over
million
in
after
increasing
by
almost
million
in
production
in
the
lower
states
excluding
federal
waters
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
most
of
it
from
shale
plays
is
predicted
to
rise
by
next
year
down
from
million
in
provided
they
are
sustained
lower
prices
should
help
bring
an
unsustainable
production
boom
back
under
control
and
keep
domestic
and
international
markets
closer
to
balance
