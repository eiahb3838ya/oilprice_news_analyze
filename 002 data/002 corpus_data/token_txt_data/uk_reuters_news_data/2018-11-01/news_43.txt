ongc
videsh
ltd
for
overdue

from
a
joint

according

the

s
oil
and
natural

corp
to
repatriate
about
million
in
dividends
due
from

in
venezuela
but
pdvsa
had
not
transferred
any
money
to
ongc
videsh
in
over
a
year
the
sources
said
due
to
venezuela
s
economic
meltdown
and
sanctions
that
complicate
payments
through
banks
that
had
made
it
difficult
to
pay
in
cash
that
changed
when
some
barrels
of
venezuelan
crude
left
venezuela
s
main
oil
port
of
jose
earlier
in

pdvsa
which

international
court
actions
over

debts
recently
has
begun
paying
some
creditors
mostly
in
oil
to
avoid
further
asset
seizures
the

is
also
seeking
to
stimulate
investment
in
venezuela
s
unraveling
oil
industry
where
annual
production
is
at
its
lowest
in
almost
seven
decades
by
trying

meet
some
of
its
obligations
to
foreign
partners
the

ongc
was
arranged
through
india
s
reliance
industries

on

almost
all
its
export

the
combination
of
falling

and

sanctions

hyperinflation
have
pushed
the

april
ongc
