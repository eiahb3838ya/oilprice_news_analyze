though
this

after
a
brutal
october
month
the

had
fallen
percent

it

soichiro

senior

at

sb
investments
in
tokyo
the
ongoing
rebound
has
further
room
to
go
the
trade
conflict
will
continue
popping
up
as
a
market
factor
going
forward
but
the
worst
fears
appear
to
have
subsided
for
now
at
least
through
the
midterm
the
pound
surged
percent
to
after
the
times
reported
that
british

a

give
british

down
percent
at
the

spiked
to
a
high
of

on
a
adp
national
employment
report
which
showed
that
private
sector
payrolls
increased
by
the
most
in
eight
months
in
october
the
greenback
has
recently
enjoyed
a
boost
from
robust
economic
reports
including
data
last
week
which
showed
the
economy
slowed
less
than
expected
in
the
third
quarter
the

still
not

off
a

the
previous
day
on

china
on
wednesday
said
it
will
issue
