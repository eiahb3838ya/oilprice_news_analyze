lopez
obrador
will
have
a
better
chance
of
slashing
poverty
and

if
he
weaves
a
strong
green
thread
through
his
policies
analysts
say
but
despite
high
hopes
the

will
be
a
top
priority
for
his
government
some

plans
to
boost

by
revitalising
mexico
s

industry
sit
uncomfortably
with
pledges
on

and
biodiversity
if
they
achieve
everything
they
say
in
six
years
mexico
will
be
in
a
very
strong
position
regarding

mexico
director
for

group
greenpeace
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
it
s
the

city
known
by
his

violence
and
inequality
in
a
bid
to
transform
the
latin
american
country
where
over
percent
live
in
poverty
outlining
its
environmental
strategy
before
the
poll
his
party
said
it
would
prioritise
communities
as
it
seeks
to
improve
water
quality
and
access
while
strengthening
climate
change
action
and
promoting
sustainable
cities
and
biodiversity
however
experts
say
steps
to
slash
carbon
emissions
reduce
deadly
air
pollution
and
push
greener
public
transport
are
at
odds
with
the
new
president
s
intention
to
reinvigorate
the
petroleum
industry
seeking
to
curb
massive
fossil
fuel
imports
from
the
united
states
lopez
obrador
wants
to
prioritise
domestic
crude
oil
production
which
has
fallen
since
while

one
or
two
refineries

a
think
tank
said
mexico
had
high
potential
for
cleaner
energy
sources
that
can
help
a
lot
in
achieving
the
main
goal
which
is
energy
with
many
other
benefits
he
said
mexico
has
a
target
of
producing
percent
of
electricity
from
clean
sources
by
compared
to
just
over
a
fifth
today
fighting
poverty
and
climate
change
are
closely
linked

mexico
s
ministry
of
environment
and
natural
resources
has
seen
its
budget
cut
by
a
third
since
the
current
president
enrique
pena
nieto
came
to
power
morena
wants
to
rewrite
a
law
it
says
prioritises
water
concessions
for
industry
over
households
in
mexico
where
water
access
is
deemed
a
human
right
more
than
percent
of
homes
lack
a
regular
water
supply
and
percent
of
surface
water
is
contaminated
environmentalists
said
more
money
was
needed
to
enforce
laws
to
stop
industrial
pollution
and
protect
watersheds
restoring
damaged
ecosystems
like
forests
which
are
largely
owned
by
rural
and
indigenous
communities
could
also
improve
water
access
and
quality
while
creating
local
jobs
they
added
the
new
government
s
plan
for
a
national
climate
change
policy
that
promotes
renewable
energy
sources
including
solar
wind
and
mini
plants
could
turn
on
the
lights
and
bring
opportunities
for
poor
communities
experts
said
large
investors
are
increasingly
looking
to
holdings
and
are
less
interested
in
petroleum

they

and
waste
management
said
aguilar
whose
exchange
expects
to

she
urged
the
new
government
to
make
environmental
disclosure
mandatory
for
businesses
to
help
investors
choose
well
and
ensure
pension
funds
put
a
minimum
into
green
assets
rolling

mexico
s
national
biodiversity
strategy
will
be
essential
to
strengthen
its
ecosystems
by
said
the
national
commission

conabio

more
sustainable

upgrade

also
on
its
list
are
reducing
marine

coastal
damage
exacerbated
by
poorly
planned
development
while
stopping

mexico

forests
the

says

lopez
obrador
has
said
he
will
not
undertake
projects
without
first
considering
their
environmental
and
community
impacts
and
green
groups
will
be
watching
closely
we
believe
this
new
administration
has
a
great
opportunity
to
reconcile
society
with
