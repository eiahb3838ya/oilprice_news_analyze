an
industry
report
suggesting

stockpiles

soon
decline
again
after
a
surprise
rise
in
the
latest
week
traders
said
prices
rallied
early
when
industry
information
provider
genscape
reported
that
crude
inventories
at
the
cushing
oklahoma
delivery
hub
for
crude
dropped

when
the

reported
that
in
the
prior
week
total
inventories
rose
million
barrels
while
supplies
at
cushing
fell
million
barrels
there
s
an
expectation
that
the
build
from
this
week
will
be
gone
next

crude
rose

before
the

sparked
a
rally
futures
fell
early
on
concerns
about
oversupply
saudi
arabia
russia
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
have
increased
production
to
help
to
compensate
for
an
anticipated
shortfall
in
iranian
crude
supplies
once
sanctions
take
effect
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
partners
including
russia
had
cut
output
to
rebalance
supply
and
demand
oil
is
holding
up
reasonably
well
a
lot
of
this
is
the
risk
premium
priced
in
for
iran
and
when
do
we
start
seeing
an
impact
on
supply
there
ing
commodities
strategist
warren
patterson
said
at
the
moment
there
is
a
mismatch
in
timing
where
there
is
increasing
opec
supply
and
yet
we
re
not
seeing
a
significant
reduction
in
iranian
supply
patterson
said
officials
told
reuters
on
wednesday
that
they
believe
iran
is
preparing
to
carry
out
a
major
exercise
in
the
gulf
apparently
moving
up
the
timing
due
to
heightened
tensions
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
pull
out
of
an
international
nuclear
deal
and
reimpose
sanctions
on
iran
has
angered
tehran
there
are
a
lot
of
escalation
points
that
could
occur
very
quickly
and
that
worries
me
jonathan
barratt
chief
investment
officer
at
ayers
alliance
in
sydney
said
worries
about
the
possible
loss
of
iranian
supply
are
being
somewhat
offset
by
concerns
that
global
trade
tensions
could
slow
economic
growth
and
crimp
energy
demand
trump
has
turned
up
pressure
on
china
for
trade
concessions
by
proposing
a
higher
percent
tariff
on
billion
of
chinese
imports
china
has
said
it
will
retaliate
it
is
almost
certain
that
china
will
impose
additional
duties
on
oil
and
refined
products
imported
from
the
if
the
trump
administration
implements
additional
tariffs
on
the
next
tranche
of
chinese
goods
this
could
severely
dent
the
competitiveness
of
oil
and
derivatives
in
the
chinese
market
