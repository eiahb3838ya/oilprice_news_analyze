insight-run your dishwasher when the sun shines: dynamic power pricing grows
paris
reuters
one
day
the
weather
could
drive
your
domestic
schedule
your
dishwasher
springs
to
life
at
the
windiest
time
of
day
the
washing
machine
starts
spinning
when
the
sun
beats
down
in
such
scenarios
algorithms
in
smart
appliances
automatically
respond
to
price
drops
on
wholesale
spot
markets
caused
by
higher
supplies
of
wind
and
solar
power
saving
households
money
and
balancing
the
electricity
market
this
may
be
many
years
away
but
it
is
the
future
envisioned
by
the
european
union
which
wants
to
make
the
electricity
system
more
efficient
as
the
continent
switches
from
predictable
power
generation
to
intermittent
renewables
most
utilities
have
long
offered
cheaper
tariffs
but
new
eu
rules
expected
in
will
require
them
to
provide
more
flexible
options
that
encourage
customers
to
use
power
during
sunny
or
windy
periods
at
varied
times
of
day
or
when
businesses
are
shut
at
weekends
these
kind
of
flexible
dynamic
pricing
contracts
are
already
widely
offered
in
spain
and
scandinavia
but
utilities
in
some
of
the
biggest
european
markets
like
britain
and
france
are
now
beginning
to
follow
suit
in
a
shift
that
analysts
say
could
disrupt
the
continent
s
electricity
retailing
industry
the
nascent
drive
is
enabled
by
the
mass
rollout
of
smart
meters
which
can
precisely
record
energy
usage
patterns
from
now
on
consumers
in
europe
will
be
able
to
seize
more
spot
market
opportunities
as
the
rise
of
renewable
power
and
the
availability
of
smart
meters
and
appliances
boost
dynamic
pricing

newer
smaller
players
are
offering
the
most
experimental
tariffs
selling
power
in
hourly
or
even
slots
tied
to
wholesale
spot
prices
the
big
traditional
utilities
like
edf
and
centrica
are
responding
more
gradually
by
offering
variable
options
borchardt
director
internal
energy
market
at
the
european
commission
the
eu
s
executive
says
variable
pricing
could
cut
power
bills
for
a
household
by
up
to
euros
a
year
it
is
early
days
in
europe
and
in
other
developed
power
markets
such
as
the
united
states
and
australia
utilities
largely
sell
at
fixed
prices
regardless
of
wholesale
swings
or
time
of
usage
and
dynamic
pricing
accounts
for
a
fraction
of
the
market
but
it
is
growing
the
number
of
customers
on
dynamic
pricing
rates
globally
is
expected
to
rise
from
million
in
to
million
by
of
which
million
will
be
in
europe
according
to
navigant
research
analyst
brett
feldman
experts
say
automation
will
be
crucial
for
the
proportion
of
households
with
smart
appliances
is
expected
to
rise
to
about
percent
globally
by
from
percent
now
according
to

statista
convenience
is
key
ollagnier
said
users
want
to
be
able
to
set
and
forget
smart
rules
for
their
the
commission
agrees
to
enable
consumers
to
benefit
financially
from
those
new
opportunities
they
must
have
access
to
smart
systems
as
well
as
electricity
supply
contracts
with
dynamic
prices
it
said
in
a
policy
document
an
anticipated
surge
in
electric
vehicle
usage
will
also
bolster
uptake
of
flexible
pricing
tariffs
analysts
say
british
startup
octopus
energy
in
march
launched
an
agile
tariff
which
sells
power
in
slots
tied
to
wholesale
spot
prices
it
also
sends
sms
alerts
when
prices
turn
negative
and
customers
get
paid
for
taking
excess
power
off
the
grid
which
happens
a
few
times
a
year
on
sunny
and
windy
days
the
company
whose
uk
market
share
is
about
percent
has
limited
the
experimental
tariff
to
of
its
more
than
residential
customers
we
hit
that
limit
quickly
and
are
now
assessing
the
impact
before
expanding
further
which
we
expect
to
do
next
year
ceo
greg
jackson
said
octopus
told
reuters
it
was
working
with
electronics
companies
including
samsung
to
allow
its
software
to
communicate
with
smart
household
appliances
so
that
they
can
switch
on
automatically
at
the
cheapest
time
the
company
said
a
family
on
its
agile
tariff
could
have
saved
pounds
over
the
last
months
compared
with
average
british
prices
green
energy
uk
another
small
player
is
offering
contracts
with
varying
rates
for
residential
customers
ranging
on
weekdays
from
pence
per
kilowatt
hour
to
pence
in
france
engie
which
has
million
customers
has
also
started
offering
flexible
pricing
deals
including
percent
weekend
discounts
and
for
electric
vehicle
owners
a
percent
discount
for
nighttime
charging
engie
s
retail
chief
augustin
honorat
declined
to
detail
how
many
customers
have
flexible
tariffs
it
is
a
success
as
the
offers
are
among
our
he
said
the
flexible
contracts
offered
by
new
players
are
prompting
traditional
utilities
to
offer
their
own
options
analysts
say
french
market
leader
edf
for
example
has
launched
offers
with
to
percent
tariff
discounts
for
weekend
use
and
a
tariff
that
offers
varying
rates
for
each
period
of
the
day
edf
marketing
director
gregory
trannoy
said
the
new
offers
were
growing
quickly
but
declined
to
give
numbers
oliver
wyman
consultant
keric
morris
said
dynamic
pricing
was
a
big
operational
challenge
for
traditional
utilities
it
is
much
more
difficult
for
an
incumbent
with
all
its
legacy
systems
than
for
a
nimble
he
said
the
european
commission
s
clean
energy
package
aims
to
force
all
utilities
to
offer
customers
smart
meters
and
a
dynamic
price
contract
linked
to
spot
market
prices
the
rules
are
being
negotiated
with
the
eu
parliament
and
member
states
this
year
with
a
target
for
implementation
from
that
may
be
overly
ambitious
several
eu
states
do
not
yet
have
the
smart
meters
required
for
flexible
pricing
notably
major
power
market
germany
the
case
of
spain
gives
an
idea
of
the
potential
of
dynamic
pricing
as
well
as
the
possible
obstacles
spain
decreed
in
that
utilities
had
to
offer
dynamic
pricing
contracts
as
the
default
regulated
offer
all
spanish
utilities
now
offer
contracts
linked
to
hourly
spot
prices
on
the
omie
exchange
and
with
utilities
margins
set
by
regulation
the
european
commission
estimates
that
in
spain
where
million
smart
meters
were
installed
end
about
percent
of
power
users
have
some
form
dynamic
pricing
however
pedro
gonzalez
head
of
regulation
at
spanish
utilities
association
unesa
told
reuters
that
this
is
down
from
about
percent
four
year
ago
despite
the
fact
that
power
is
slightly
cheaper
on
dynamic
contracts
their
number
has
fallen
as
customers
switch
to
contracts
because
they
want
the
peace
of
mind
of
not
being
exposed
to
fluctuating
wholesale
prices
surprisingly
despite
the
fact
that
average
dynamic
prices
should
be
lower
many
people
want
to
avoid
risk
and
prefer
to
pay
a
fixed
amount
per
month
gonzalez
said
he
said
the
number
of
people
on
dynamic
pricing
contracts
has
been
stable
over
the
past
year
and
that
in
recent
months
utilities
have
started
offering
intermediate
options
such
as
varying
rates
for
different
blocks
of
the
day
in
the
nordics
many
utilities
offer
dynamic
pricing
though
uptake
ranges
from
about
percent
in
the
tiny
but
highly
digital
baltic
country
estonia
to
percent
in
finland
and
a
few
percent
in
sweden
and
norway
according
to
eu
data
industry
specialists
say
much
will
depend
on
to
what
extent
the
european
commission
s
proposal
on
dynamic
pricing
is
accepted
but
all
agree
the
higher
the
share
of
renewables
in
total
generation
the
bigger
the
pressure
will
become
to
make
demand
more
flexible
octopus
energy
s
jackson
said
mass
rollout
of
smart
meters
could
ultimately
lead
to
a
sophisticated
form
of
congestion
pricing
with
supply
and
demand
increasingly
driving
prices
on
trains
and
airlines
the
first
seats
are
very
cheap
the
last
ones
very
expensive
he
said
the
electricity
market
will
end
up
like
