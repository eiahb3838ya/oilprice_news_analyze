the
phoney
war
stage
of
president
donald
trump
s
trade
dispute
with
china
may
be
ending
with
economic
indicators
and
commodity
flows
and
prices
starting
to
show
real
world
effects
the
latest
signal
that
china
s
economy
may
be
feeling
some
pain
associated
with
trump
s
tariffs
on
about
billion
in
chinese
goods
was
the
softening
of
the
purchasing
managers
index
pmi
in
july
while
the
overall
drop
to
in
july
from
june
s
was
small
of
bigger
concern
was
the
slump
in
the
subindex
for
new
export
orders
which
dropped
to
a
fourth
consecutive
monthly
decline
the
drop
in
the
pmi
a
key
indicator
of
manufacturing
health
in
the
world
s
economy
came
as
trump
s
administration
proposed
a
percent
tariff
on
another
billion
in
chinese
goods
up
from
an
earlier
percent
plan
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
said
in
a
statement
on
wednesday
that
trump
directed
the
increase
from
the
previously
proposed
duty
because
china
has
refused
to
meet
demands
and
imposed
retaliatory
tariffs
on
goods
while
a
poor
pmi
for
one
month
doesn
t
necessarily
signal
a
new
trend
it
does
highlight
the
risk
that
the
trade
dispute
is
starting
to
hit
economic
growth
the
so
called
phoney
war
was
an
period
of
limited
engagements
and
conflict
at
the
start
of
world
war
ii
lasting
from
britain
declaring
war
on
germany
over
its
invasion
of
poland
to
the
nazis
invading
france
and
the
low
countries
while
a
trade
dispute
is
obviously
not
comparable
to
a
shooting
war
the
current
imbroglio
may
follow
a
similar
pattern
of
months
of
mainly
rhetoric
and
skirmishes
before
an
eruption
into
a
serious
economic
event
as
early
indicators
of
global
economic
health
and
trade
flows
movements
in
commodity
prices
and
volumes
can
be
instructive
the
temptation
is
always
to
look
first
at
copper
given
its
correlation
with
both
manufacturing
and
construction
london
metal
exchange
copper
futures
have
been
trending
lower
since
reaching
their
peak
for
this
year
so
far
in
early
june
closing
at
a
tonne
on
wednesday
this
is
down
almost
percent
from
the
june
peak
a
period
that
coincides
with
the
ramping
up
of
tariffs
by
the
united
states
coupled
with
increasingly
bellicose
rhetoric
china
s
appetite
for
imported
copper
has
yet
to
falter
however
with
imports
of
unwrought
copper
up
percent
from
a
year
ago
according
to
chinese
customs
data
in
fact
the
rate
of
growth
in
the
first
half
well
exceeded
the
percent
increase
in
imports
of
copper
in
the
first
half
of
showing
that
not
only
is
china
importing
more
of
the
industrial
metal
it
s
doing
so
at
a
faster
pace
the
strong
copper
imports
may
seem
contradictory
to
the
weak
prices
although
it
s
likely
that
the
market
has
been
dropping
mainly
on
sentiment
rather
than
on
supply
and
demand
other
commodities
also
paint
a
mixed
picture
with
china
s
iron
ore
imports
dropping
percent
in
the
first
six
months
of
from
the
same
period
last
year
iron
ore
prices
have
also
been
dropping
with
benchmark
percent
fines
as
assessed
by
argus
media
ending
at
a
tonne
on
wednesday
down
almost
percent
from
their
peak
this
year
of
in
late
february
the
steel
sector
appears
robust
though
with
prices
rising
and
solid
gains
in
china
s
steel
pmi
to
a
high
of
in
july
well
above
the
level
that
demarcates
expansion
from
contraction
fundamental
reasons
can
be
found
for
both
the
weakness
in
iron
ore
which
is
well
supplied
and
the
strength
in
steel
which
is
still
seeing
strong
demand
and
output
restrictions
coal
is
another
commodity
that
appears
to
have
been
unaffected
by
trade
war
concerns
with
both
chinese
import
demand
and
prices
rising
strongly
china
imported
almost
percent
more
of
the
polluting
fuel
in
the
first
half
of
while
the
benchmark
thermal
coal
price
at
australia
s
newcastle
port
rose
to
a
tonne
on
wednesday
the
highest
in
years
china
s
coal
demand
for
power
generation
has
been
rising
and
domestic
output
gains
haven
t
been
able
to
keep
pace
meaning
a
draw
on
the
seaborne
market
which
is
already
supply
constrained
with
major
exporters
australia
and
indonesia
unable
to
boost
output
there
are
commodities
that
have
been
affected
by
the
trade
dispute
but
not
to
the
extent
of
influencing
global
pricing
at
least
so
far
china
appears
to
have
stripped
back
its
imports
of
crude
oil
to
near
zero
for
september
having
taken
about
barrels
per
day
in
the
first
six
months
of
the
year
according
to
data
it
s
the
same
story
for
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
with
only
one
cargo
booked
for
arrival
in
august
and
it
departed
the
gulf
of
mexico
on
july
before
much
of
the
current
escalation
in
the
trade
dispute
the
odd
thing
is
that
crude
oil
and
lng
aren
t
subject
to
any
formal
trade
tariffs
and
they
appear
most
affected
while
steel
which
is
the
target
of
tariffs
is
performing
strongly
logic
suggests
that
if
the
trade
dispute
does
continue
to
drag
on
china
s
economic
performance
eventually
steel
will
join
copper
in
trending
lower
thus
keeping
an
eye
on
china
s
imports
of
major
commodities
in
coming
months
will
be
key
to
working
out
just
how
quickly
the
trade
dispute
is
filtering
through
to
the
real
economy
and
determining
if
the
phoney
trade
war
has
become
a
real
one
