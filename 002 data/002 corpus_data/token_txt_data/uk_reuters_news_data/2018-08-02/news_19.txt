is
on
a
drive

it
tries
to
emerge
from
a
financial
crisis

has
been
grappling
with
labour
unrest
for
weeks
after
it
initially
refused
to
raise
salaries

caved
in
to
union
demands
for
higher
pay
after
protesting

forced
some

its
generating
units
to
be
switched
off
leading
to
power
outages
in
africa
s
most
industrialised
economy

accepted
a
salary
increase
of
percent
this
year
and
percent
next
year

the
year
after

which
represents
mostly
skilled

said
in
a
statement
for
all
our
members
across
south
africa
the
right
thing
to
do
now
would
be
to
help
prevent
the
economy
from
being
hampered
by
an
unreliable
power
supply
