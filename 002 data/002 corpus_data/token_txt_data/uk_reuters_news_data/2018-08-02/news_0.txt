update 6-u.s. states vow to fight trump rollback on auto emissions
reuters
california
and
other
states
promised
on
thursday
to
fight
a
trump
administration
proposal
to
weaken
fuel
efficiency
standards
for
cars
and
trucks
and
force
states
into
line
arguing
the
united
states
has
an
obligation
to
protect
the
environment
for
future
generations
the
administration
billed
the
proposed
rollback
from
fuel
efficiency
standards
as
a
way
to
help
car
companies
and
lower
vehicle
prices
for
consumers
but
critics
said
the
plan
would
accelerate
climate
change
and
increase
fuel
prices
by
seeking
to
strip
california
of
its
authority
to
set
its
own
strict
vehicle
emissions
standards
the
proposal
also
opens
new
questions
about
the
limits
of
federal
powers
over
states
the
states
and
washington
announced
they
would
sue
to
halt
the
proposed
rollback
touching
off
what
will
likely
be
a
heated
legal
showdown
possibly
making
it
to
the
supreme
court
it
could
also
become
a
polarizing
issue
in
elections
in
november
the
trump
administration
has
launched
a
brazen
attack
no
matter
how
it
is
cloaked
on
our
nation
s
clean
car
standards
said
california
s
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
california
will
use
every
legal
tool
at
its
disposal
to
defend
strict
standards
he
said
in
a
statement
many
states
have
adopted
california
s
emission
rules
and
together
they
make
up
about
one
third
of
the
auto
market
making
the
stakes
for
the
autos
industry
enormous
the
administration
said
the
proposed
rollback
would
mean
billions
of
dollars
in
regulatory
savings
for
car
manufacturers
but
the
industry
is
pushing
for
a
negotiated
settlement
between
states
and
the
administration
to
lift
uncertainty
over
the
kinds
of
cars
and
trucks
it
will
need
to
produce
for
the
american
market
in
the
coming
years
the
proposal
to
roll
back
efforts
is
in
line
with
president
donald
trump
s
decision
last
year
to
abandon
the
paris
agreement
under
which
countries
agreed
to
take
steps
to
mitigate
global
warming
it
also
dovetails
with
the
republican
president
s
broader
effort
to
unwind
green
regulation
much
of
it
enacted
by
democratic
former
president
barack
obama
s
administration
the
proposal
from
the
transportation
department
and
environmental
protection
agency
would
freeze
fuel
efficiency
standards
at
levels
through
and
require
dramatically
fewer
electric
vehicles
as
more
people
continue
to
drive
vehicles
the
administration
said
the
freeze
would
boost
oil
consumption
by
about
barrels
of
oil
a
day
by
the
and
argued
it
would
prevent
up
to
traffic
fatalities
per
year
by
reducing
the
price
of
new
vehicles
and
so
prompting
people
to
buy
newer
safer
vehicles
more
quickly
unless
the
obama
administration
s
punishing
standards
are
changed
consumer
choice
will
be
limited
and
the
cost
of
vehicles
will
skyrocket
said
republican
senator
john
barrasso
americans
shouldn
t
be
denied
the
ability
to
purchase
a
car
or
truck
that
meets
their
environmental
groups
criticized
the
assertion
about
reducing
crash
deaths
and
said
the
proposal
would
drive
up
gasoline
prices
increase
smog
and
reverse
one
of
the
most
significant
steps
washington
has
taken
to
curb
greenhouse
gas
emissions
the
clean
car
standards
are
already
saving
our
families
billions
at
the
pump
supporting
nearly
american
jobs
and
cleaning
up
dangerous
tailpipe
pollution
said
rhea
suh
president
of
the
natural
resources
defense
council
we
need
to
speed
up
that
progress
not
slide
the
administration
must
gather
feedback
on
the
proposal
before
it
is
finalized
a
process
that
could
take
months
and
that
could
be
further
delayed
by
lawsuits
the
transportation
department
says
the
proposal
would
shrink
regulatory
costs
for
automakers
by
billion
through
reducing
by
more
than
billion
what
general
motors
co
ford
motor
co
and
fiat
chrysler
automobiles
nv
each
would
have
been
expected
to
spend
to
comply
with
the
rules
toyota
motor
corp
would
save
billion
and
volkswagen
ag
billion
general
motors
said
in
a
statement
that
it
wants
to
work
with
all
parties
to
achieve
one
national
program
adding
it
was
committed
to
continually
improving
fuel
economy
and
our
commitment
to
an
the
administration
also
contends
that
hiking
oil
consumption
by
to
percent
over
forecast
levels
would
have
a
minimal
impact
on
the
environment
boosting
global
average
temperature
by
just
of
a
degree
celsius
by
trump
s
decision
to
challenge
california
s
authority
to
regulate
vehicle
emissions
upends
decades
of
federal
policy
that
allowed
the
most
populous
and
richest
state
to
combat
air
pollution
that
particularly
afflicts
los
angeles
the
trump
administration
proposal
said
california
s
zero
emission
vehicle
rules
adopted
by
nine
other
states
are
technologically
california
will
fight
this
stupidity
in
every
conceivable
way
possible
governor
edmund
jerry
brown
a
democrat
said
in
a
statement
democrats
hope
to
make
any
rollback
of
the
emissions
rules
a
key
part
of
november
s
midterm
elections
when
they
will
try
to
regain
control
of
one
or
both
chambers
of
congress
republicans
in
states
with
links
to
the
auto
industry
may
counter
that
the
administration
is
working
to
ensure
automakers
can
make
more
profitable
larger
vehicles
including
pickups
and
suvs
some
middle
ground
might
be
possible
acting
epa
chief
andrew
wheeler
said
on
wednesday
he
would
welcome
a
deal
between
the
industry
and
states
bill
wehrum
an
assistant
epa

told
reporters
on
thursday
that
many
things
had
changed
including
a
drop
in
fuel
prices
since
the
efficiency
rules
were
last
set
six
years
ago
he
said
gas
prices
are
at
historically
low
levels
and
that
changes
driving
habits
that
changes
the
kind
of
cars
and
trucks
that
people
want
to
federal
and
california
officials
would
soon
meet
about
the
proposal
wehrum
said
adding
all
of
us
want
one
national
program
we
are
going
to
try
to
work
it
becerra
