a
vessel
that
arrived
in
bangladesh
in
april
to
offload
its
maiden
cargo
of
liquefied
natural
gas
and
moor
permanently
as
an
import
terminal
should
begin
operations
within
a
week
after
bad
weather
hampered
its
an
official
said
on
thursday
the
floating
storage
and
regasification
unit
fsru
will
allow
bangladesh
to
import
lng
for
the
first
time
as
its
domestic
gas
production
falls
and
will
boost
several
power
projects
in
a
nation
where
percent
go
without
electricity
since
its
arrival
at
moheshkhali
near
cox
s
bazar
in
southeast
bangladesh
bad
weather
has
hampered
the
fsru
s
efforts
to
dock
properly
connect
to
the
import
infrastructure
and
offload
its
first
cargo
of
qatari
lng
officials
have
said
the
delay
was
basically
the
rough
sea
it
the
project
will
succeed
very
soon
hopefully
within
a
week
a
director
at
energy
firm
petrobangla
s
lng
division
said
the
excellence
fsru
is
operated
by
privately
owned
company
excelerate
which
launched
the
first
fsru
in
the
world
in
and
still
dominates
the
industry
alongside
golar
lng
hoegh
and
bw
group
s
lng
arm
two
senior
petrobangla
officials
said
the
firm
would
contest
excelerate
s
declaration
of
force
majeure
on
the
project
due
to
the
delays
declaring
force
majeure
absolves
a
company
from
responsibility
for
delays
to
fulfilling
contracts
due
to
circumstances
beyond
its
control
they
have
claimed
force
majeure
for
bad
weather
but
we
haven
t
accepted
it
one
of
the
officials
said
petrobangla
doesn
t
have
any
obligation
to
pay
any
money
before
the
gas
flow
starts
excelerate
will
pay
demurrage
as
per
that
official
said
technical
experts
from
international
finance
corp
an
arm
of
the
world
bank
which
lent
to
the
million
project
were
on
site
monitoring
progress
the
country
of
million
people
relies
on
its
gas
resources
for
percent
of
its
energy
production
but
as
demand
has
risen
its
falling
supply
has
struggled
to
keep
up
prompting
it
to
consider
a
host
of
lng
projects
aside
from
the
moheshkhali
project
several
others
are
being
considered
usually
combining
lng
imports
with
onshore
power
plants
that
would
use
the
regasified
fuel
as
feedstock
or
with
fertiliser
complexes
that
are
heavily
most
recently
two
projects
costing
a
combined
billion
were
announced
involving
firm
general
electric
energy
trading
houses
gunvor
vitol
and
trafigura
have
also
chased
projects
in
bangladesh
is
seen
as
an
ideal
lng
importer
because
it
has
the
legacy
of
using
gas
and
therefore
much
of
the
onshore
infrastructure
already
unlike
some
other
countries
that
have
struggled
to
get
lng
projects
off
the
ground
nasrul
hamid
state
minister
for
power
energy
and
mineral
resources
said
the
moheshkhali
project
would
help
bangladesh
import
million
cubic
metres
of
gas
a
day
by
we
have
a
robust
internal
gas
supply
system
which
has
historically
transmitted
our
local
gas
this
grid
will
carry
the
lng
internally
this
is
an
advantage
for
us
