australia
s
trade
surplus
blew
past
expectations
in
june
as
exports
to
china
boomed
to
their
second
highest
on
record
a
sign
the
country
was
weathering
the
early
stages
of
tariff
hostilities
a
report
on
thursday
from
the
australian
bureau
of
statistics
showed
australia
s
trade
surplus
swelled
by
percent
to
a
billion
billion
double
the
market
forecast
and
the
largest
since
may
last
year
exports
climbed
percent
on
a
in
a
broad
range
of
goods
from
iron
ore
and
gold
to
farm
and
manufactured
items
the
data
showed
imports
fell
percent
as
a
pullback
in
petrol
outweighed
strength
in
transport
and
telecoms
equipment
the
windfall
owed
much
to
china
which
has
been
hoovering
up
australia
s
iron
ore
and
coal
output
even
as
trade
tensions
with
the
united
states
have
escalated
analysts
noted
that
much
of
australia
s
exports
to
china
are
primary
products
used
in
the
asian
nation
s
domestic
economy
rather
than
for
there
has
also
been
no
sign
of
a
slowdown
in
the
rapid
growth
of
chinese
tourism
or
the
flow
of
students
from
the
country
indeed
exports
of
goods
to
china
hit
the
second
strongest
on
record
in
june
at
a
billion
an
increase
of
almost
percent
from
the
same
month
last
year

have
few
concerns

alone
at

came

seasonally
adjusted

billion
down
modestly
from
the
first
quarter
when
a
rebound
in
resource
shipments
flattered
the
accounts
much
of
that
pullback
looked
to
be
due
to
changes
in
prices
rather
than
volumes
and
thus
not
a
drag
on
gross
domestic
growth

net
exports
are
likely
to
be
slightly
positive
in
adding
in
the
order
of
percentage
points
to
activity
he
estimated
analysts
had
thought
trade
exports
minus
imports
would
subtract
from
gdp
in
the
second
quarter
given
it
had
added
a
sizable

the
quarter
