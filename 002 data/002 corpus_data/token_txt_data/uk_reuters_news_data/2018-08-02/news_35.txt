analysis-u.s. utilities balk at expanded carbon-capture subsidy
richmond
texas
reuters
few
energy
policies
can
bring
together
coal
miners
oil
drillers
environmentalists
republicans
and
democrats
but
tax
credits
for
capturing
and
storing
carbon
dioxide
emissions
have
appeased
all
these
camps
and
congress
this
year
tripled
the
subsidy
s
value
with
broad
bipartisan
support
if
only
they
could
convince
utilities
the
biggest
industrial
polluters
to
get
on
board
a
reuters
survey
of
the
top
power
companies
showed
eight
have
no
plans
to
purchase
and
install
carbon
capture
and
storage
ccs
equipment
citing
high
costs
and
uncertain
demand
while
the
other
two
declined
to
comment
another
three
utilities
that
are
to
adopt
the
technology
because
of
their
proximity
to
existing
carbon
pipelines
and
coal
reserves
also
said
they
have
no
plans
to
tap
the
newly
enriched
subsidy
the
technology
employs
sophisticated
equipment
to
pull
carbon
dioxide
from
industrial
plants
and
then
inject
it
underground
so
it
never
pollutes
the
atmosphere
that
could
help
fight
climate
change
while
giving
coal
and
natural
gas
plants
a
new
commodity
they
can
sell
to
oil
drillers
when
carbon
dioxide
is
injected
into
ageing
oil
fields
it
helps
drillers
increase
pressure
and
push
more
oil
to
the
surface
the
potential
of
ccs
is
on
display
in
texas
where
the
utility
nrg
and
joint
venture
partner
jx
nippon
a
japanese
energy
firm
built
a
billion
operation
called
petra
nova
at
the
state
s
largest
power
plant
in
the
months
since
nrg
installed
the
shiny
steel
pipes
and
towers
the
project
has
kept
nearly
million
tons
of
gas
from
the
atmosphere
and
multiplied
oil
output
at
the
nearby
west
ranch
oil
field
by
petra
nova
had
key
financial
advantages
that
are
difficult
for
other
utilities
to
duplicate
the
japanese
government
provided
a
million
million
loan
to
the
project
in
hopes
of
finding
better
ways
to
use
coal
as
an
alternative
to
nuclear
energy
after
the
fukushima
nuclear
disaster
in
the
effort
also
won
a
million
grant
in
from
the
department
of
energy
s
clean
coal
power
initiative
which
supports
innovations
that
produce
clean
reliable
and
affordable
electricity
from
coal
david
knox
an
nrg
spokesman
said
operating
petra
nova
is
showing
the
firm
ways
to
cut
costs
for
the
next
generation
of
the
technology
such
as
using
smaller
towers
with
less
steel
we
feel
you
can
build
a
second
one
for
maybe
up
to
percent
cheaper
knox
said
although
his
company
is
focussed
on
perfecting
petra
nova
rather
than
building
a
new
ccs
operation
other
utilities
that
do
not
have
access
to
the
same
government
and
private
funding
worry
that
investments
on
ccs
would
not
pay
off
even
with
tax
credits
now
worth
per
tonne
of
carbon
dioxide
captured
and
reused
compared
to
previously
any
new
industrial
facility
that
injects
carbon
dioxide
into
an
oil
field
before
is
eligible
for
the
expanded
tax
credit
but
the
programme
s
success
relies
heavily
on
power
plants
which
produce
nearly
percent
of
carbon
emissions
although
increased
credits
for
ccs
are
positive
the
amount
still
does
not
address
the
significant
capital
and
operating
costs
said
melissa
mchenry
a
spokeswoman
for
american
electric
power
in
a
comment
typical
of
responses
from
other
utilities
duke
energy
southern
dominion
exelon
xcel
pg
e
and
edison
international
also
said
they
had
no
such
plans
while
nextera
energy
inc
and
pseg
did
not
comment
three
small
utilities
that
industry
watchers
say
are
among
the
to
adopt
ccs
technology
rocky
mountain
power
black
hills
and
og
e
also
told
reuters
they
had
no
plans
to
do
so
carbon
capture
is
definitely
interesting
it
just
hasn
t
made
economic
sense
just
yet
said
spencer
hall
a
spokesman
for
rocky
mountain
power
utilities
say
that
it
is
unclear
when
or
if
revenues
from
ccs
would
cover
the
required
investment
another
concern
is
that
president
donald
trump
s
successor
could
reverse
efforts
to
support
the
coal
industry
accelerating
plant
closures
and
making
ccs
investments
pointless
the
hesitancy
of
utilities
represents
a
setback
for
the
coal
industry
which
had
hoped
carbon
capture
would
help
extend
the
lives
of
power
plants
it
also
means
that
oil
companies
that
want
access
to
greater
supplies
of
carbon
dioxide
may
need
to
look
beyond
coal
and
gas
plants
texas
drillers
have
been
revitalising
ageing
fields
for
years
using
carbon
dioxide
from
naturally
occurring
deposits
and
from
natural
gas
processing
but
those
supplies
are
not
enough
to
sustain
the
industry
s
ambitions
occidental
petroleum
corp
the
top
user
of
the
technique
in
the
permian
basin
wants
to
expand
its
use
of
carbon
injection
from
traditional
oil
fields
to
shale
wells
said
jody
elliott
the
president
of
occidental
s
american
operations
the
company
believes
the
technique
could
boost
oil
output
in
the
largest
oil
field
by
barrels
per
day
from
million
now
the
permian
has
a
large
inventory
of
future
projects
which
could
be
developed
over
the
next
years
elliott
said
but
that
would
require
carbon
captured
from
power
stations
and
plants
that
make
ethanol
fertiliser
and
cement
along
with
billions
of
dollars
in
new
pipelines
to
take
carbon
to
the
fields
julio
friedmann
who
worked
in
the
energy
department
under
president
barack
obama
and
earlier
as
a
scientist
for
exxon
mobil
said
he
sees
interest
from
ethanol
plants
and
other
industrial
facilities
to
add
carbon
capture
to
plants
but
urged
utilities
to
join
them
i
don
t
know
what
they
imagine
they
are
looking
for
he
said
but
if
they
are
just
waiting
for
better
policy
treatment
they
may
be
