shanghai
international
energy
exchange
ine
is
considering
appointing
market
makers
to
boost
trading
volumes
in
its
nascent
crude
oil
futures
amid
growing
concerns
about
liquidity
as
the
first
contract
heads
for
expiry
later
this
month
responding
to
a
report
by
reuters
earlier
on
thursday
the
ine
part
of
the
shanghai
futures
exchange
shfe
said
in
an
email
that
it
was
studying
introducing
a
scheme
following
requests
from
some
investors
the
exchange
has
approached
at
least
two
major
brokers
in
recent
weeks
about
finding
investors
to
help
drum
up
business
in
the
forward
months
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
those
investors
would
be
similar
to
market
makers
who
are
often
deployed
by
international
exchanges
such
as
cme
group
inc
and
intercontinental
exchange
to
fuel
activity
in
new
contracts
in
recent
days
some
market
investors
have
asked
the
exchange
to
follow
practices
from
other
international
exchanges
and
introduce
the
market
making
scheme
to
further
provide
liquidity
for
forward
month
contracts
the
ine
said
we
are
seriously
considering
the
request
and
demands
from
investors
and
are
currently
studying
and
seeking
advice
from
investors
for
a
plan
the
exchange
said
the
potential
candidates
for
the
role
would
be
institutional
investors
such
as
wealth
managers
and
hedge
funds
the
sources
said
the
sources
declined
to
be
identified
as
they
are
not
authorised
to
speak
to
the
media
the
move
comes
amid
worries
among
investors
and
brokers
that
liquidity
in
the
market
is
concentrated
in
the
september
contract
which
expires
at
the
end
of
this
month
september
s
expiry
is
seen
as
a
big
test
of
china
s
first
oil
contract
which
was
launched
four
months
ago
aimed
at
gaining
greater
clout
in
global
crude
pricing
more
investors
will
roll
their
september
contracts
into
december
in
the
coming
weeks
right
now
liquidity
in
december
is
not
high
enough
to
attract
big
investors
said
wang
xiao
head
of
crude
oil
research
with
guotai
junan
futures
oil
majors
have
helped
provide
liquidity
but
getting
a
commitment
from
other
investors
to
do
so
would
enhance
efforts
to
increase
interest
in
the
market
monthly
exchange
data
shows
that
turnover
in
the
contract
has
surged
since
its
launch
in
july
it
accounted
for
percent
of
global
turnover
in
oil
futures
taking
third
place
behind
london
s
brent
and
west
texas
intermediate
wti
with
arab
oil
heavyweight
dubai
in
fourth
but
most
of
the
daily
turnover
and
open
interest
a
measure
of
liquidity
is
concentrated
in
the
september
contract
which
expires
at
the
end
of
this
month
the
december
contract
has
a
cluster
of
activity
but
the
is
steep
chinese
commodity
futures
investors
do
not
typically
trade
steadily
over
the
months
but
instead
pick
specific
months
in
which
they
deal
that
complicates
efforts
to
trade
spreads
between
brent
wti
and
shanghai
the
monthly
gap
between
shanghai
contracts
and
global
oil
futures
created
difficulties
for
arbitrage
said
wang
having
more
liquidity
spread
out
across
forward
months
is
considered
important
for
luring
international
hedge
funds
and
other
financial
players
who
like
to
trade
month
by
month
open
interest
across
the
first
five
months
of
the
brent
and
wti
contracts
and
is
relatively
evenly
spread
out
ine
slashed
fees
for
the
october
and
november
contracts
last
month
and
on
tuesday
cut
them
for
the
january
and
february
months
which
was
seen
as
an
effort
to
make
liquidity
spread
out
more
evenly
across
forward
months
and
to
engage
in
industrial
traders
such
as
refiners
who
tend
to
trade
month
by
month
the
ine
said
combined
open
interest
in
those
four
contracts
was
just
lots
on
thursday
equivalent
to
just
under
barrels
of
oil
and
tiny
in
comparison
to
september
which
has
almost
lots
of
open
interest
