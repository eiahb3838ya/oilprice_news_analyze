the
green
climate
fund
set
up
to
channel
billions
of
dollars
to
help
developing
nations
tackle
climate
change
must
operate
more
efficiently
with
greater
political
attention
needed
to
make
that
happen
the
united
nations
climate
chief
said
on
thursday
the
fund
s
july
board
meeting
at
its
south
korean
base
which
ended
in
disarray
after
its
executive
director
resigned
and
the
board
failed
to
reach
key
decisions
was
a
cause
of
concern
patricia
espinosa
said
in
an
interview
we
need
to
overcome
the
obstacles
that
did
not
allow
the
board
to
deliver
on
the
very
important
work
it
had
to
conclude
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
fund
is
independent
although
it
was
established
by
the
climate
talks
as
a
key
vehicle
for
climate
finance
espinosa
said
she
did
not
have
a
specific
formula
or
suggestions
for
its
reform
what
i
think
is
indispensable
is
to
get
a
higher
level
of
attention
a
political
level
of
attention
to
make
this
institution
work
she
said
urging
finance
ministries
to
get
involved
in
the
discussions
the
green
climate
fund
gcf
has
been
beset
by
arguments
between
rich
and
poor
nations
about
how
and
where
to
invest
the
billion
it
was
promised
by
wealthy
governments
in
tensions
have
also
risen
since
president
donald
trump
who
plans
to
pull
the
united
states
out
of
the
paris
climate
accord
indicated
he
would
not
deliver
a
remaining
billion
of
billion
promised
to
the
gcf
by
his
predecessor
the
fund
s
deputy
executive
director
javier
manzanares
said
on
wednesday
the
last
board
meeting
had
been
somewhat
of
a
setback
but
gcf
still
has
a
huge
role
to
play
and
we
are
already
delivering
he
told
pacific
government
officials
in
micronesia
so
far
the
gcf
has
committed
billion
to
projects
from
boosting
energy
efficiency
in
brazilian
cities
to
helping
maldives
islanders
manage
water
shortages
in
a
warmer
world
observers
have
suggested
reducing
the
number
of
gcf
board
members
now
and
devolving
to
its
secretariat
decisions
on
which
projects
should
be
funded
ben
bartle
a
senior
climate
finance
expert
with
consultancy
e
said
the
fund
was
at
a
critical
juncture
where
it
needed
to
streamline
its
processes
become
more
transparent
and
disburse
money
for
projects
faster
espinosa
who
heads
the
climate
change
secretariat
said
the
fund
which
began
making
investment
decisions
only
in
was
still
very
young
it
is
also
grappling
with
an
innovative
model
that
gives
developed
and
developing
countries
an
equal
say
she
added
but
she
expressed
high
hopes
it
would
get
back
to
work
as
soon
as
possible
at
its
next
meeting
in
october
the
board
should
review
the
pipeline
of
projects
it
did
not
consider
in
july
she
added
and
define
a
process
to
start
replenishing
its
coffers
another
area
of
controversy
should
the
fund
not
advance
on
those
issues
before
the
next
annual
climate
conference
in
december
where
countries
are
due
to
agree
guidelines
to
implement
the
paris
agreement
it
will
impact
on
the
general
atmosphere
she
said
assuring
developing
states
they
will
get
the
climate
change
funding
they
need
to
reduce
emissions
and
adapt
to
more
extreme
weather
and
rising
seas
in
line
with
their
national
plans
is
a
very
central
element
of
the
paris
pact
said
espinosa
rich
governments
have
promised
to
mobilise
billion
per
year
in
climate
finance
for
vulnerable
countries
by
but
have
not
set
out
a
clear
pathway
to
reach
that
goal
climate
financing
from
the
world
s
six
largest
multilateral
development
banks
a
major
source
of
funding
rose
to
billion
in
up
percent
on
they
said
in
june
the
same
projects
attracted
an
additional
billion
from
other
sources
of
financing
last
year
they
noted
espinosa
said
the
negative
messages
from
the
trump
administration
on
the
climate
change
process
and
its
unwillingness
to
contribute
money
were
an
element
that
is
not
sending
the
signals
to
build
up
the
trust
that
we
need
but
other
countries
had
stayed
committed
to
the
global
accord
because
it
was
in
their
own
interests
she
said
it
a
question
of
how
valuable
is
this
agreement
for
the
future
of
humanity
