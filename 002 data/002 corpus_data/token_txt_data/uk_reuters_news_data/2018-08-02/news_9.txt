rome
reuters
italian
prime
minister
giuseppe
conte
on
thursday
met
the
mayor
at
the
centre
of
a
dispute
threatening
to
delay
work
on
the
billion
euro
billion
pounds
trans
adriatic
pipeline
but
made
no
commitment
about
changing
the
project
conte
said
he
met
marco
poti
mayor
of
melendugno
a
seaside
resort
on
italy
s
heel
where
the
tap
pipeline
will
land
together
with
a
team
of
legal
and
technical
experts
to
discuss
what
he
called
critical
aspects
of
the
pipeline
i
assured
them
the
government
will
conduct
an
assessment
of
the
whole
dossier
conte
said
after
the
meeting
adding
however
that
legal
commitments
had
already
been
made
by
the
previous
administration
conte
also
clarified
to
poti
that
diversifying
italy
s
energy
supplies
remains
a
strategic
goal
a
government
source
said
grassroots
opposition
to
the
project
has
revolved
mainly
around
alleged
environment
risks
and
the
fear
the
pipeline
could
discourage
tourism
the
mayor
who
has
argued
that
the
area
he
represents
is
totally
unsuitable
as
the
landing
point
of
the
pipeline
said
conte
had
told
him
the
project
could
be
scrapped
if
the
government
finds
any
procedural
irregularities
he
said
he
was
pleased
to
note
a
different
political
climate
compared
with
the
previous
government
tap
the
last
leg
of
the
billion
southern
gas
corridor
that
will
bring
azeri
gas
to
italy
is
due
to
start
pumping
gas
in
but
the
local
opposition
has
raised
concern
that
work
at
the
italian
end
may
not
be
completed
in
time
the
pipeline
is
viewed
as
strategic
by
the
european
union
as
it
moves
to
wean
itself
off
its
dependency
on
russian
gas
in
july
italian
president
sergio
mattarella
confirmed
italy
was
committed
to
tap
at
a
meeting
with
president
donald
trump
on
monday
conte
said
he
was
aware
of
the
strategic
nature
of
the
pipeline
and
would
visit
the
local
community
and
mayor
to
seek
a
solution
the
trump
administration
is
keen
to
see
the
pipeline
completed
on
