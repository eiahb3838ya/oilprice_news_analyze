extreme

said
one

declining

he
was
not

to

about
commercial

coal
has
reacted
stronger
than
natural
gas
because
more
spare
coal
capacity
has
been
activated
he
said
temperatures
in
key
regions
of
north
asia
and
europe
hit
records
in

the
heat
that

the

japanese
utilities
have
cranked
up
old
power
stations
to
cope
with
the
spike
in
power
demand
which
has
also
sent
the
country
s
wholesale

prices
to
record
highs
extreme
heat
has
also
gripped
large
parts
of
europe
with
temperatures
in
spain
and
portugal
exceeding
degrees
celsius
and
even
scandinavia
seeing
temperatures
of
more
than

the
hot
weather
has
also
pushed
up
river
temperatures
across
the
region
forcing
several
nuclear
power
stations
that
use
the

european

germany

are
not
major
buyers
of
australian
coal
but
their
increased
demand
is
still
being
felt
as
a
ripple
effect
amid
a
globally
tighter
coal
market
traders
said
overall
thermal
coal
prices
have
this
year
outperformed
other
fossil
fuels
like
crude
oil
and
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
as
the
strong
demand
comes
amid
stagnant
output

availability
in
oil

has
been
rising

boom
virtually
uninterrupted
since

some
in
the
industry
are
asking
how
long
the
rally
can
continue
traders
said
falling
domestic
coal
prices
in
china
already
pointed
to
lower
buying
interest
from
the
world
s
biggest
coal
consumer
as
we
get
into
the
shoulder
season
we
should
see
some
of
the
summer
demand
wane
as
cooler

prevail

added
the

has
fallen
about

since
