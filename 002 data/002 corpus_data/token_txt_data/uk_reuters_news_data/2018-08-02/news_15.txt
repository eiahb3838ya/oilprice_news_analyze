fmc
corp
which
is
spinning
off
its
lithium
division
as
a
publicly
traded
company
later
this
year
said
on
thursday
that
prices
for
the
light
metal
continue
to
rise
on
strong
demand
from
electric
vehicle
battery
makers
there
are
growing
worries
about
oversupply
in
the
lithium
sector
with
several
new
production
facilities
under
construction
around
the
globe
fmc
on
wednesday
posted
a
profit
helped
in
part
by
a
percent
increase
in
sales
of
lithium
hydroxide
and
carbonate
the
two
most
common
derivations
of
lithium
used
by
battery
suppliers
for
tesla
inc
and
others
we
are
seeing
sequential
pricing
as
well
as
very
strong
pricing
fmc
chief
executive
pierre
brondeau
said
on
a
conference
call
with
investors
spot
market
prices
in
china
for
lithium
have
plunged
this
year
due
in
part
to
the
oversupply
concerns
though
the
chinese
spot
market
is
relatively
small
fmc
like
competitor
albemarle
corp
has
annual
contracts
with
customers
that
it
renegotiates
annually
the
company
is
able
to
charge
more
under
those
contracts
as
demand
rises
for
the
metal
a
critical
battery
component
brondeau
said
fmc
which
also
produces
agricultural
chemicals
plans
to
spin
off
its
lithium
division
in
an
initial
public
offering
in
october
under
the
livent
corp
name
for
fmc
expects
lithium
sales
of
million
to
million
in
what
would
be
at
least
a
percent
increase
from
last
year
though
executives
noted
that
not
all
of
that
is
spread
out
equally
among
all
quarters
fmc
s
main
lithium
production
facility
is
in
argentina
where
the
country
s
peso
currency
has
been
dropping
in
value
to
the
dollar
this
year
due
in
part
to
weakness
in
emerging
markets
and
uncertainty
about
the
local
economy
that
devaluation
actually
boosted
exports
from
the
lithium
division
in
the
second
quarter
brondeau
said
shares
of
fmc
fell
percent
to
on
thursday
as
markets
were
mixed
