white house to propose weaker auto emissions rules, overriding california
aug
reuters
the
trump
administration
on
thursday
will
move
to
revoke
california
s
authority
to
set
its
own
strict
tailpipe
emissions
rules
and
mandate
the
sale
of
electric
vehicles
as
it
proposes
weakening
federal
fuel
efficiency
standards
the
proposal
to
roll
back
efforts
to
be
released
early
on
thursday
according
to
one
administration
official
is
in
line
with
president
donald
trump
s
decision
last
year
to
abandon
the
paris
deal
aimed
at
slowing
climate
change
it
will
escalate
the
administration
s
legal
battle
with
california
and
about
a
dozen
other
states
that
have
adopted
california
s
emission
rules
and
account
for
about
a
third
of
the
auto
market
seventeen
states
including
california
and
the
district
of
columbia
filed
a
lawsuit
in
may
challenging
the
environmental
protection
agency
s
decision
a
month
earlier
to
declare
vehicle
emission
rules
in
place
through
not
in
march
california
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
said
he
would
use
every
legal
tool
to
protect
the
current
standards
trump
promised
midwestern
auto
workers
last
year
that
he
would
tear
up
vehicle
rules
touted
by
the
administration
of
former
president
barack
obama
as
among
its
biggest
climate
actions
democrats
hope
to
make
any
rollback
a
key
part
of
the
congressional
elections
republicans
in
states
with
links
to
the
auto
industry
may
contend
the
administration
is
working
to
ensure
automakers
can
make
more
profitable
larger
vehicles
including
pickups
and
suvs
without
excess
regulation
and
state
interference
some
middle
ground
on
the
issue
might
be
possible
with
acting
epa
chief
andrew
wheeler
saying
wednesday
he
would
welcome
a
deal
between
the
industry
and
states
like
california
on
vehicle
fuel
economy
once
they
consider
the
trump
administration
s
proposal
the
rollback
in
emissions
standards
is
problematic
for
automakers
the
administration
has
said
it
will
deliver
regulatory
relief
potentially
worth
billions
by
reducing
the
need
for
costly
technologies
required
to
achieve
greater
fuel
efficiency
but
it
does
so
in
a
way
that
could
create
more
uncertainty
for
an
industry
already
struggling
with
rising
tariff
risks
and
a
murky
sales
outlook
automakers
have
long
pressed
for
one
set
of
rules
for
emissions
and
greenhouse
gases
saying
a
national
regulatory
framework
to
improve
fuel
economy
reduces
complexity
and
costs
for
the
industry
the
preferred
option
in
the
administration
s
proposal
to
be
issued
by
the
epa
and
the
department
of
transportation
would
freeze
the
obama
fuel
efficiency
targets
at
levels
requiring
no
further
improvement
that
means
the
fleets
of
cars
and
light
trucks
sold
by
automakers
in
the
united
states
could
average
about
miles
km
per
gallon
instead
of
the
mpg
projected
for
under
the
obama
rules
fuel
consumption
would
increase
by
about
barrels
daily
as
a
result
a
person
briefed
on
the
matter
said
adding
that
such
an
increase
would
have
only
a
negligible
impact
on
the
global
climate
the
administration
has
characterized
its
proposal
to
freeze
fuel
efficiency
and
emissions
targets
as
a
step
that
would
save
up
to
lives
per
year
by
reducing
the
cost
of
new
vehicles
and
encouraging
people
to
buy
safer
new
cars
sooner
environmental
groups
have
criticized
that
analysis
and
said
the
proposal
would
drive
up
gasoline
prices
and
reverse
one
of
the
most
significant
steps
washington
has
taken
to
curb
climate
changing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
it
would
also
put
more
lives
at
risk
due
to
emissions
environmental
advocates
say
trump
s
decision
to
challenge
california
s
authority
to
regulate
vehicle
emissions
upends
decades
of
federal
policy
undertaken
to
allow
the
largest
state
to
combat
air
pollution
that
particularly
afflicts
los
angeles
eliminating
california
s
electric
vehicle
mandate
could
hurt
automakers
like
tesla
inc
and
general
motors
co
which
are
already
investing
billions
in
evs
relying
on
the
state
s
regulatory
authority
california
governor
jerry
brown
a
democrat
set
a
target
in
january
of
putting
million
vehicles
on
the
roads
in
california
by
up
from
a
prior
goal
of
million
