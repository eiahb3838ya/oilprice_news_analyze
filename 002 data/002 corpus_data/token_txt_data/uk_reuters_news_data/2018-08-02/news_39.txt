s
senior
crude
oil
executive
in
china
geng
tao
said
on
thursday
he
has
left
the
swiss
commodities
trading
house
the
latest
sign
that
business
in
the
world
s
largest
crude
importer
is
getting
more
challenging
in
a

he
said
he
departed
the
company
a
few
days
ago
he
did
not
give
a
reason
for

his

the
appointments

as
of
oil
for
trafigura
last
month
in
april
the
company
named

li
yuting
another
senior
oil
marketer
at
trafigura
left
the
firm
last
year
said
a
trading
executive
briefed
on
the
matter
global
oil
suppliers
are
facing
a
more
competitive
business
environment
in
china
this
year
as
demand
has
slowed
from
independent
refineries
due
to
tighter
government
tax
rules
and
as
oil
prices
have
risen
to
highs
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
trafigura
s
profits
sank
percent
due
in
part
to
the
market
shift
from
a
contango
where
forward
prices
of
a
commodity
are
higher
than
prompt
prices
to
backwardation
which
discourages
storing
oil
for
sale
