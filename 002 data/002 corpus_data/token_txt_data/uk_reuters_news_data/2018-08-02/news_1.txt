the
trump
administration
on
thursday
took
a
giant
step
backward
on
transportation
innovation
by
issuing
a
proposal
to
freeze
federal
rules
requiring
automakers
to
design
more
efficient
cars
in
april
protection
agency
chief
scott
pruitt
called
the
current
standards
too
high
and
said
they
did
not
comport
with
but
globally
these
standards
have
helped
american
automakers
to
remain
competitive
as
other
countries
particularly
china
embrace
the
transition
to
a
economy
by
reversing
course
on
regulations
the
united
states
is
encouraging
automakers
to
build
outdated
vehicles
in
a
market
ceding
market
leadership
to
china
in
the
process
current
federal
vehicle
standards
require
automakers
to
produce
passenger
vehicles
that
meet
specific
and
standards
the
administration
s
proposal
lays
out
eight
possible
scenarios
for
scaling
back
the
standards
with
the
preferred
option
being
to
freeze
them
at
levels
through
whether
from
a
market
safety
or
environmental
perspective
this
is
misguided
historically
federal
regulation
of
the
auto
industry
has
led
to
better
vehicles
just
look
at
seat
belts
safety
brakes
and
glass
standards
for
windshields
all
of
which
led
to
the
development
of
safer
cars
that
have
become
the
global
standard
over
the
past
half
century
looking
forward
it
s
clear
that
or
vehicles
will
dominate
our
global
transportation
future
the
vehicle
emission
rules
provide
incentives
for
automakers
to
produce
and
sell
vehicles
and
electric
vehicles
in
particular
as
these
are
both
cleaner
and
more
efficient
than
cars
and
trucks
companies
can
manufacture
these
vehicles
but
can
also
meet
the
standards
by
purchasing
credits
from
other
auto
companies
that
have
more
mature
ev
or
vehicle
lines
the
rules
are
flexible
but
they
re
also
critical
to
maintaining
leadership
on
ev
manufacturing
according
to
the
environmental
and
energy
study
institute
eesi
policy
support
is
playing
a
major
role
in
developing
and
deploying
evs
in
both
the
united
states
and
china
which
is
why
the
two
countries
lead
the
world
in
ev
registrations
today
rolling
back
federal
rules
will
relieve
pressure
for
manufacturers
to
invest
in
electric
vehicles
and
could
have
significant
impacts
for
the
united
states
last
year
global
ev
sales
surpassed
the

first

prices
dropped
percent
from

a
trend
that
will
only
accelerate
as
global
demand
for
evs
rises
china
recently
joined
the
uk
france
norway
and
india
in
pledging
to
phase
out
the
use
of
vehicles
in
the
coming

even
exxon

surging

the
most
aggressive
market
outlook
shows
evs
making
up
over
percent
of
the
entire

fleet
by
automakers
are
reading
the
tea

they
ve
announced
billion

investments
to
get
million
more
electric
vehicles
on
the
world
s
roads
by
around
the
united
states
is
making
a
strong
showing
on
evs
but
china
leads
the
pack
in
half
of
global

production
took

in
china
where
demand
for

is
expected
to
triple
by
the
government

offering
generous
incentives
to
scale
up
ev

and

more
important
china
has
offered
generous
terms
to
international
automakers
looking
to
establish
themselves
in
the
country
it
s
working
american
companies
like
ford
and
general
motors
have
announced
hefty
investments
in
china
s
ev
market
and
ford
s
chairman
is
on
the
record
as
saying
that
china
will
lead
the
world
in
ev
the
united
states
accounted
for
percent
of
global
production
of
electric
vehicles
in
putting
it
in
second
place
behind
china
while
domestic
policies
are
spurring
significant
growth
in
the
ev
market
there
is
also
increasing
consumer
demand
recent
data
from
aaa
shows
that
one
in
five
drivers
will
likely
go
electric
when
buying
their
next
car
and
drivers
are
becoming
less
concerned
about
running
out
of
battery
charge
while
driving
evs
ford
gm
and
toyota
are
all
adapting
their
production
accordingly
indicative
of
the
larger
global
shift
toward
evs
but
of
the
top
electric
vehicle
manufacturers
nine
have
headquarters
in
china
while
only
three
are
based
in
the
united
states
china
accounts
for
percent
of
global
investment
in
evs
and
projections
show
that
the
country
will
lead
the
market
through
china
s
potential
dominance
in
the
changing
auto
sector
matters
auto
manufacturing
constitutes
about
three
percent
of
gdp
and
accounts
for
the
most
jobs
of
any
manufacturing
sector
losing
these
jobs
and
this
market
share
to
another
country
is
no
laughing
matter
especially
in
the
midwest
and
southeast
states
in
michigan
ohio

more

freezing

efficiency
standards
at
this
critical
juncture
when
momentum
is
picking
up
and
billions
of
dollars
in

are
following
suit
would
cede
the
growing
ev
market
to
china
and
create
unnecessary
regulatory
uncertainty
for
automakers
in
the
united

the
trump
administration
should
preserve
the
current
standards
or
risk
encouraging
american
automakers
to
build
the
cars
of

in
an
increasingly

future
