minimal
spokeswoman
sara
hughes
said
in
an
email
the
company
believes
the
problem
started
with
a
nearby
pipeline
there
was
a
pipeline
involved
that
also
experienced
a
failure
and
preliminary
indications
are
that
the
line
failure
occurred
before
the
epng
line
failure
hughes
said
the
outage
on
the
epng
line
will
affect
less
than
million
cubic
feet
per

gas
prices

hub

increased
by
cents
or
about
percent
at
midday
on

to
per
million
british
thermal
units
tyler
jubert
an
energy
analyst
at
s
p
global
platts
said
the
relatively
small
volumes
affected
should
have
little
influence
on
hub
prices
some
of
thursday
s
gain
could
be
attributed
to
strong
demand
in
the
west
where
temperatures
are
hotter
than
normal
