turkmenistan
is
voting
in
a
parliamentary
election
on
sunday
with
a
choice
of
three
parties
and
some
independents
but
all
the
candidates
are
ultimately
loyal
to
president
kurbanguly
berdymukhamedov
leader
of
the
nation
one
of
the
candidates
is
the
president
s
son
serdar
berdymukhamedov
regarded
by
observers
as
a
potential
successor
to
the
leader
who
is
referred
to
by
local
people
as
arkadag
or
protector
although
the
vote
takes
place
against
the
backdrop
of
foreign
currency
shortages
brought
on
by
a
drop
in
gas
exports
there
are
no
opposition
parties
in
the
former
soviet
republic
of
six
million
polling
stations
greeted
voters
with
national
music
and
dance
shows
and
snacks
the
election
is
a
real
holiday
for
us
which
will
bring
peace
prosperity
and
stability
said
maskat
muratdyrdyev
head
of
a
provincial
polling
station
not
far
from
ashgabat
official
data
shows
almost
a
quarter
of
registered
voters
had
cast
their
ballots
by
gmt
within
the
first
two
hours
of
voting
not
everyone
was
enthusiastic
though
i
have
three
kids
to
feed
gasoline
prices
have
gone
up
and
everything
has
become
more
expensive
said
taxi
driver
mergen
who
said
he
would
not
vote
i
think
they
will
deal
with
the
election
without
there
are
candidates
contesting
seats
in
the
legislature
whose
main
job
is
to
bills
drafted
by
the
cabinet
another
legislative
body
in
the
predominantly
muslim
nation
is
the
halk
maslahaty
or
people
s
council
chaired
by
the
president
which
has
more
powers
than
parliament
and
consists
of
deputies
elected
by
local
councils
however
the
position
of
parliament
speaker
is
important
because
holders
of
the
office
become
acting
president
if
the
head
of
state
is
unable
to
carry
out
his
work
some
observers
have
tipped
serdar
berdymukhamedov
to
eventually
become
speaker
and
the
designated
successor
to
his
father
who
has
run
the
country
since
and
is
the
centre
of
an
extravagant
personality
cult
a
golden
statue
of
the
president

a
horse
stands
in
the
centre
of
ashgabat
in
a
symbolic
move
serdar
berdymukhamedov
who
had
worked
as
a
diplomat
before
becoming
an
mp
in
attended
a
summit
of
central
asian
leaders
in
kazakhstan
this
month
that
his
father
skipped
turkmenistan
s
economy
depends
heavily
on
exports
of
natural
gas
and
russia
was
its
main
customer
for
decades
thanks
to
pipelines
but
moscow
halted
purchases
of
turkmen
gas
in
leaving
as
the
main
buyer
china
which
has
built
its
own
pipeline
from
scratch
the
ashgabat
government
is
building
a
new
pipeline
through
neighbouring
afghanistan
to
pakistan
and
china
in
an
attempt
to
open
up
additional
export
markets
