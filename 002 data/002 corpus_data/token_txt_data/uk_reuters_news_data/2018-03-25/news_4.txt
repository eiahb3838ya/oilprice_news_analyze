respond
to
investor
calls
for
improved
shareholder
returns
investors
in
shale
have
seen
thin
returns
despite
booming
production
as
shale
firms
have
used
profits
to
invest
in
raising
output
more
rather
than
returning
cash
to
shareholders
seven
independent
shale
producers
including
anadarko
petroleum
corp
and
conocophillips
have
boosted

a

oil
prices
plunged

are
using
a
large
megaphone
as
they
talk

twelve
of
the

and
other
projects
parsley
energy

and
continental
resources
inc
are
among
the
largest
of
that
group
focusing
on
driving
growth
in
the
and
shale

respectively
that
may
change
as
more
