re
two
extremes
that
could
destroy
the

let
s
put
it
behind
us
and
start
a
lot
is
at

too
for

cutting
business
taxes
bolstering
the
oil

petro
a
member
of
the
now
defunct
insurgent
group
wants
a
new
economic
model
that
ditches
reliance
on
extractive
industries
for
renewable
energy
and
a
land
reform
that
promotes
an
increase
in
productive
use
his
policies
have
prompted
rivals
to
compare
him
to
venezuela
s
former
socialist
president
hugo
chavez
the
markets
and
the
productive
sector
see
duque
as
someone
who
guarantees
the
continuity
of
the
current
economic
model
while
they
see
petro
as
someone
who
would
break
it
down
said
carlos
sepulveda
dean
of
economics
at
rosario
university
oil
company
ecopetrol
sa
is
responsible
for
almost
percent
of
colombia
s
oil
production
of
around
barrels
per
day
and
operates
export
pipeline
infrastructure
petro
would
shift
its
emphasis
toward
wind
and
solar
power
i
really
don
t
like
either
of
them
but
as
i
have
to
choose
it
has
to
be
duque
said
carlos
mora
a
lawyer
with
petro
i
really
think
we
ll
end
up
like
some
candidates
from
the
first
round
have
asked
colombians
to
cast
blank
ballots
a
means
for
voters
to
demonstrate
dissatisfaction
with
the
choice
of
candidates
sergio
fajardo
nudged
into
third
place
by
petro
last
month
said
on
friday
neither
petro
nor
duque
represent
a
good
option
the
blank
vote
will
be
higher
than
usual
because
the
two
candidates
are
from
the
most
extreme
positions
on
right
and
left
leaving
the
moderate
centrist
electorate
with
no
obvious
option
