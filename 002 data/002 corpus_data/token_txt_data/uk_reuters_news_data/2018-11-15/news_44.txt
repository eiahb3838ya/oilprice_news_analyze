france
has
enough
power
supply
for
the
winter
but
needs
to
be
vigilant
if
there
is
a
cold
spell
from
through
to
the
end
of
february
when
supply
is
expected
to
be
tight
due
to
nuclear
outages
grid
operator
rte
said
on
thursday
rte
said
in
its
winter
and
outlook
that
up
to
electricity
demand
and
supply
is
expected
to
be
balanced
but
without
any
margin
due
to
the
expected
shutdown
of
some
thermal
power
generation
units
rte
s
director
of
operations
roubin
said
analysis
showed
that
under
normal
weather
conditions
demand
was
expected
to
remain
stable
with
peak
demand
seen
at
around
gigawatts
gw
the
same
level
as
last
winter
roubin
speaking
at
a
news
conference
said
french
nuclear
power
supply
which
accounts
for
over
percent
of
its
electricity
needs
was
expected
to
increase
this
winter
compared
with
last
year
due
to
fewer
outages
while
hydro
power
supply
was
also
expected
to
be
stable
but
between
and
the
end
of
february
supply
could
be
tight
if
there
is
a
prolonged
cold
spell
because
edf
has
planned
maintenance
outages
at
five
nuclear
reactors
two
reactors
could
be
halted
for
several
weeks
this
situation
could
lead
to
after
market
measures
including
calls
to
industrial
users
and
consumers
to
curb
consumption
increased
imports
from
neighbours
and
lowering
voltage
on
the
network
after
winter
france
will
have
enough
supply
to
potentially
allow
it
to
gradually
shut
down
five
coal
power
units
in
cordemais
havre
gardanne
and
and
also
the
fessenheim
nuclear
power
plant
under
certain
conditions
