washington
reuters
the
trump
administration
plans
to
set
up
a
promoting
fossil
fuels
at
the
annual
climate
talks
next
month
repeating
a
strategy
that
infuriated
activists
during
last
year
s
talks
according
to
three
people
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
as
with
the
gathering
in
bonn
germany
the
administration
plans
to
highlight
the
benefits
of
technologies
that
more
efficiently
burn
fuels
including
coal
the
sources
said
this
year
s
talks
in
katowice
poland
located
in
a
mining
region
that
is
among
the
most
polluted
in
europe
are
intended
to
hammer
out
a
rule
book
to
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
which
set
a
sweeping
goal
of
ending
the
era
this
century
by
spurring
a
transition
to
cleaner
energy
sources
such
as
solar
and
wind
power
even
as
the
trump
administration
aims
to
promote
energy
strategies
that
could
detract
from
those
international
goals
it
also
plans
to
let
state
department
officials
continue
negotiating
the
climate
accord
a
recognition
that
the
next
president
may
drop
the
nation
s
opposition
to
the
pact
the
white
house
seems
to
have
taken
the
view
that
it
s
important
to
let
technocrats
complete
the
work
of
the
rule
book
it
s
in
the
national
interest
to
be
at
the
table
and
see
an
outcome
that
emphasizes
transparency
holds
countries
accountable
said
one
of
the
sources
who
is
familiar
with
state
department
plans
the
white
house
and
the
state
department
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
the
united
states
the
world
s
top
oil
and
gas
producer
is
the
only
country
to
have
announced
its
intention
to
formally
withdraw
from
the
paris
accord
the
administration
s
resistance
has
come
against
a
backdrop
of
increasingly
urgent
warnings
from
scientists
about
the
threats
posed
by
greenhouse
gas
emissions
from
fossil
fuels
the
panel
will
come
less
than
two
months
after
the
s
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
warned
in
a
report
that
the
world
s
use
of
coal
for
generating
power
will
need
to
be
nearly
eliminated
by
to
between
and
percent
of
the
global
mix
from
around
percent
now
to
help
prevent
deadly
droughts
storms
and
floods
brought
on
by
climate
change
quite
frankly
the
is
the
only
party
to
the
convention
that
appears
to
be
willing
to
push
a
rational
discussion
on
the
role
of
cleaner
more
efficient
fossil
fuels
and
the
role
of
civilian
nuclear
energy
said
one
of
the
sources
who
is
involved
in
the
planning
of
the
event
for
katowice
likely
to
be
held
on
the
source
who
did
not
want
to
be
named
due
to
the
sensitive
nature
of
the
issue
said
the
event
will
be
dominated
by
proponents
of
coal
and
natural
gas
and
likely
advanced
nuclear
power
too
the
panel
will
also
likely
feature
a
energy
department
representative
at
this
point
plans
do
not
include
a
renewable
power
industry
representative
the
source
said
the
event
is
expected
to
be
led
by
wells
griffith
trump
s
international
energy
and
climate
adviser
the
sources
added
griffith
s
main
energy
policy
experience
involves
a
year
at
a
political
job
at
the
department
of
energy
and
helping
to
set
up
a
deal
last
year
to
supply
ukraine
with
coal
after
the
country
lost
control
of
mines
to
separatists
approach
trump
last
year
announced
his
intent
to
leave
the
paris
agreement
calling
it
harmful
to
the
economy
and
casting
doubt
on
the
climate
science
underpinning
the
accord
as
per
rules
trump
s
administration
will
not
be
able
to
leave
the
pact
until
a
day
after
the
presidential
election
and
officials
recognize
that
finishing
the
rule
book
and
making
sure
developing
countries
such
as
china
are
held
to
verifiable
emissions
cuts
are
in
the
national
interest
last
year
the
fossil
fuels
event
set
up
by
the
white
house
drew
widespread
protest
and
condemnation
from
climate
activists
former
new
york
mayor
michael
bloomberg
wrote
on
twitter
that
promoting
coal
at
a
climate
summit
is
like
promoting
tobacco
at
a
cancer
at
the
same
time
career
officials
from
the
state
department
and
other
agencies
continued
their
work
on
the
paris
pact
s
rule
book
envoys
to
the
bonn
talks
were
viewed
by
their
counterparts
as
constructive
and
helpful
feeding
hopes
that
the
united
states
could
eventually
be
drawn
back
into
the
accord
a
possibility
that
trump
has
held
open
but
much
has
changed
since
last
year
several
trump
administration
officials
who
supported
keeping
the
united
states
in
the
paris
pact
although
under
different
terms
have
left
the
administration
they
include
top
economic
adviser
gary
cohn
national
security
adviser
mcmaster
and
climate
and
energy
adviser
george
david
banks
now
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
and
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
are
opponents
of
the
paris
agreement
and
banks
has
been
replaced
by
griffith
director
mike
pompeo
a
vocal
critic
of
efforts
to
combat
global
warming
by
past
administrations
has
become
secretary
of
state
replacing
former
exxon
mobil
ceo
rex
tillerson
who
supported
participation
in
the
paris
agreement
that
places
trump
s
team
more
squarely
behind
his
energy
dominance
agenda
of
boosting
fossil
fuel
output
and
exports
in
part
by
promoting
technology
for
fossil
fuels
to
other
nations
the
energy
department
has
touted
technologies
including
small
scale
modular
coal
plants
that
could
burn
the
fuel
more
efficiently
and
step
in
when
clouds
and
calm
weather
limit
solar
and
wind
power
environmentalists
should
not
get
excited
that
any
state
department
cooperation
in
poland
signals
the
trump
administration
is
eyeing
a
return
to
the
paris
agreement
one
of
the
sources
said
it
s
making
sure
interests
are
paramount
nothing
more
