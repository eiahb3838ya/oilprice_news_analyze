working

an
abandoned
houseboat
renovated
as
an
office
or
living
in
a
portable
home
made
from
a
shipping
container
these
are
just
a
few
ways
residents
of
the
dutch
capital
amsterdam
can
play
their
part
to
save
the
planet
three
years
ago
the
city
launched
a
quest
to
become
a
circular
economy
reusing
products
and
materials
and
minimising
waste
by
it
now
has
related
projects
underway
according
to
eveline
jonkhoff
a
strategic
advisor
on
the
initiative
the
push
is
part
of
a
wider
effort
by
amsterdam
to
help
meet
the
goals
of
the
paris
agreement
to
curb
climate
change
she
told
a
conference
on
smart
cities
in
barcelona
this
week
other
climate
targets
for
amsterdam
focus
on
ending
the
use
of
natural
gas
by
and
putting
in
place
a
clean
public
transport
system
that
does
not
contribute
to
emissions
by
but
key
to
the
success
of
the
city
s
push
toward
carbon
neutrality
is
enabling
everyone
to
participate
jonkhoff
emphasised
all
these
changes
require
very
high
investments
and
we
need
to
make
sure
this
transition
is
affordable
for
everyone
she
said
financial
instruments
will
be
needed
to
help
residents
buy
solar
panels
and
electric
cars
so
they
are
not
just
for
the
happy
few
she
added
how
to
make
often
measures
to
limit
global
warming
available
and
appealing
to
much
of
the
public
including
the
elderly
and
the
poor
who
are
often
left
out
despite
being
most
vulnerable
to
climate
stresses
has
been
a
key
focus
of
the
barcelona
conference
this
week
in
oslo
city
authorities
are
introducing
a
new
congestion
charge
in
rush
hours
and
adding
more
than
new
road
toll
stations
in
a
bid
to
deter
polluting
traffic
but
many
people
experience
this
as
a
challenge
if
they
don
t
have
the
money
to
pay
noted
daniel
rees
political
advisor
to
the
norwegian
capital
s
deputy
mayor
shifting
to
cleaner
modes
of
getting
around
will
require
sufficient
public
transport
safe
bicycle
lanes
and
a
network
of
charging
points
for
electric
vehicles
he
said
and
if
cities
start
using
autonomous
buses
in
the
future
alternative
jobs
will
need
to
be
found
for
drivers
he
added
barcelona
mayor
ada
colau
meanwhile
highlighted
climate
justice
as
one
of
four
pillars
of
the
catalan
city
s
climate
plan
adopted
earlier
this
year
the
city
aims
to
boost
support
for
the
tenth
of
residents
who
struggle
to
pay
for
energy
and
to
improve
housing
to
save
on
energy
costs
and
reduce
health
risks
from
extreme
weather
barcelona
which
faces
more
intense
heatwaves
rain
storms
and
droughts
is
also
doubling
its
bicycle
lanes
adding
square
metres
of
greenery
per
person
by
planting
trees
and
creating
public
gardens
and
pedestrianising
some
city
blocks
among
other
measures
teresa
ribera
spain
s
minister
for
ecological
transition
told
the
conference
urban
policies
on
climate
change
can
improve
citizens
lives
in
the
form
of
cleaner
air
buildings
energy
savings
and
more
parks
greener
and
healthier
cities
are
also
safer
cities
and
more
attractive
places
to
live
she
said
but
spain
s
government
which
came
into
power
in
june
is
also
aware
that
not
everyone
will
win
if
it
steps
up
action
to
decarbonise
its
economy
as
it
is
promising
last
month
in
a
push
to
close
most
of
spain
s
coal
mines
by
the
end
of
this
year
madrid
made
a
deal
with
unions
to
invest
million
euros
million
over
the
next
five
years
in
affected
provinces
mainly
in
the
northwest
the
money
will
support
environmental
restoration
early
retirement
and
training
for
miners
to
take
up
green
energy
jobs
it
would
be
spent
under
a
proposed
system
of
just
transition
contracts
between
the
central
government
and
local
authorities
that
would
bring
in
businesses
universities
and
others
in
barcelona
ribera
told
journalists
that
modern
society
must
pay
attention
to
those
groups
who
feel
menaced
by
the
transformation
to
a
economy
and
should
offer
solidarity
we
need
to
help
those
regions
see
a
positive
constructive
future
she
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
conference
in
december
the
european
union
launched
a
platform
to
support
regions
in
countries
that
employ
people
in
coal
mining
to
shift
the
focus
of
their
economies
away
from
producing
the
dirty
fuel
and
towards
clean
energy
the
just
transition
concerns
us
all
said
elena
visnar
malinovska
head
of
adaptation
in
the
european
commission
s
climate
action
division
countries
and
cities
have
to
start
designing
climate
policies
that
minimise
the
economic
and
social
disruptive
impacts
and
really
maximise
the
benefits
