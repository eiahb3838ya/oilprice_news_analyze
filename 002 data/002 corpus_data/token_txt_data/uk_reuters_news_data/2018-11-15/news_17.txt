ukrainian
prime
minister
volodymyr
groysman
expects
to
get
new
loans
from
the
international
monetary
fund
as
early
as
december
once
parliament
passes
a
budget
of
stability
that
refrains
from
making
populist
moves
he
said
on
thursday
securing
imf
assistance
will
also
unlock
loans
from
the
world
bank
and
the
european
union
while
groysman
also
said
ukraine
was
in
negotiation
with
washington
for
a
new
loan
guarantee
for
sovereign
debt
groysman
negotiated
a
new
deal
with
the
imf
last
month
aimed
at
keeping
finances
on
an
even
keel
during
a
choppy
election
period
next
year
the
new
loans
are
contingent
on
him
steering
an
budget
through
parliament
this
budget
is
a
budget
of
stability
and
continuation
of
reforms
groysman
said
in
an
interview
with
reuters
this
is
fully
consistent
with
our
imf
yes
we
are
counting
on
a
tranche
in
december
he
added
when
asked
about
when
imf
loans
were
expected
though
he
did
not
elaborate
on
the
possible
size
of
the
loan
ukraine
s
government
approved
a
draft
budget
in
september
but
it
will
typically
undergo
a
slew
of
amendments
before
parliament
finally
approves
it
groysman
said
a
proposal
to
change
how
companies
are
taxed
on
withdrawn
capital
rather
than
profits
had
been
dropped
from
the
budget
because
of
the
imf
s
concerns
he
also
said
he
would
not
bow
to
opposition
parties
demands
to
reverse
a
recent
increase
in
household
gas
tariffs
a
step
which
his
government
reluctantly
took
in
order
to
qualify
for
more
imf
assistance
populism
led
to
the
weakness
of
ukraine
he
said
this
should
not
be
the
imf
and
kiev
s
foreign
allies
came
to
ukraine
s
rescue
after
it
plunged
into
turmoil
following
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
in
and
support
for
separatist
rebels
occupying
the
eastern
industrial
donbass
region
the
united
states
has
also
sold
coal
to
plug
a
domestic
shortage
caused
by
rebels
taking
control
of
mines
in
the
east
energy
secretary
rick
perry
visited
ukraine
this
week
in
response
to
a
question
on
whether
ukraine
would
continue
to
buy
coal
from
the
united
states
and
potentially
also
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
groysman
said
liquefied
gas
is
very
interesting
for
ukraine
we
talked
about
the
whole
spectrum
of
our
cooperation
in
the
energy
sector
he
said
adding
as
for
coal
we
will
buy
it
from
our
international
partners
until
we
cover
the
domestic
washington
has
also
previously
issued
loan
guarantees
for
ukrainian
debt
groysman
said
another
such
guarantee
