russia
wants
to
stay
out
of
any
cuts
being
touted
by
some
of
its
partners
in
an
supply
pact
two
russian
sources
told
reuters
worried
by
a
drop
in
oil
prices
due
to
slowing
demand
and
record
supply
from
saudi
arabia
russia
and
the
united
states
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
is
talking
about
a
policy
just
months
after
increasing
production
russian
president
vladimir
putin
on
thursday
avoided
giving
a
direct
answer
on
whether
production
should
be
limited
but
said
he
had
discussed
the
situation
in
global
oil
markets
with
president
donald
trump
we
need
to
be
very
accurate
here
each
word
matters
putin
told
reporters
in
singapore
but
the
fact
that
the
cooperation
with
opec
is
needed
is
obvious
and
we
will
this
week
trump
said
he
hoped
saudi
arabia
and
the
rest
of
opec
would
not
cut
production
putin
said
an
oil
price
of
around
per
barrel
suited
russia
a
steep
slide
in
prices
has
surprised
many
oil
market
participants
brent
crude
has
fallen
from
a
high
of
a
barrel
in
early
october
to
as
of
thursday
just
weeks
ago
some
trading
firms
were
talking
of
oil
i
think
oil
production
should
not
be
lowered
yes
we
have
done
this
in
the
past
but
this
was
not
the
right
systematic
approach
a
senior
russian
government
source
said
oil
production
in
russia
has
been
on
the
rise
in
recent
years
by
around
barrels
per
day
each
year
and
it
will
continue
to
do
so
in
earlier
this
week
three
sources
familiar
with
the
issue
said
opec
and
its
partners
were
discussing
a
proposal
to
cut
oil
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
although
russia
may
not
be
on
board
for
such
a
large
reduction
another
source
familiar
with
russian
thinking
said
moscow
may
support
smaller
cuts
most
likely
by
other
producers
we
think
million
bpd
cuts
is
more
realistic
not
million
bpd
but
who
is
going
to
do
this
is
another
question
the
source
said
putin
said
last
month
that
russia
was
able
to
add
another
bpd
to
its
production
russia
pumped
million
bpd
in
october
a
high
october
s
level
was
proposed
by
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
as
the
reference
point
for
any
cut
russia
s
october
level
was
around
bpd
more
than
the
million
bpd
it
had
initially
been
bound
to
produce
under
the
supply
pact
agreed
with
opec
and
other
allies
a
small
reduction
from
the
october
level
would
be
a
for
moscow
the
second
source
said
alternatively
russia
may
propose
not
to
increase
output
further
instead
of
a
cut
the
source
said
opec
and
a
group
of
nations
dominated
by
russia
have
been
cooperating
to
limit
oil
supply
since
the
start
of
they
partially
unwound
their
reduction
in
june
after
pressure
from
trump
who
wanted
lower
oil
prices
the
producers
known
informally
as
will
convene
in
the
first
week
of
december
in
vienna
to
decide
further
steps
another
indication
of
the
likelihood
of
any
russian
output
cut
can
be
gleaned
from
the
head
of
energy
giant
rosneft
putin
ally
igor
sechin
he
eschewed
a
direct
response
on
wednesday
on
whether
curbs
were
needed
saying
oil
prices
were
adjusting
after
being
hit
by
initial
uncertainty
about
production
in
iran
which
later
benefited
from
export
waivers
from
sanctions
it
the
oil
price
is
already
growing
he
said
as
brent
rebounded
from
a
steep
the
previous
day
i
believe
that
this
uncertainty
which
affected
the
oil
price
was
largely
due
to
iran
now
everything
is
being
rosneft
which
accounts
for
percent
of
russian
oil
production
plans
to
raise
its
liquid
hydrocarbon
output
further
next
year
to
million
tonnes
or
million
bpd
from
million
bpd
in
the
third
quarter
another
large
russian
oil
producer
gazprom
neft
is
ready
to
lift
output
by
a
further
bpd
this
year
and
by
bpd
next
year
the
head
of
lukoil
vagit
alekperov
voiced
opposition
this
week
to
any
cut
surging
production
is
a
headache
for
the
country
s
crude
output
is
expected
to
average
million
bpd
in
passing
million
bpd
sooner
than
expected
on
surging
shale
supply
the
energy
information
administration
said
this
month
oil
production
will
soon
plateau
it
can
t
grow
indefinitely
the
russian
government
source
said
in
the
previous
round
of
global
production
cuts
russian
oil
companies
first
opposed
the
move
but
then
relented
under
orders
from
putin
the
russian
energy
ministry
did
not
immediately
reply
to
a
reuters
