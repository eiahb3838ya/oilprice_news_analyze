a
shaggy
male
australian
shepherd
named
ic
darted
nervously
through
the
charred
remnants
of
a
house
in
paradise
california
sniffing
for
victims
of
the
deadliest
blaze
in
the
state
s
history
he
s
getting
an
overload
of
scent
said
his
handler
trish
moutard
a
volunteer
with
carda
the
california
animal
rescue
dog
society
while
searching
properties
on
forest
glen
road
in
paradise
it
s
a
new
experience
for
ic
was
among
several
cadaver
dogs
brought
in
to
look
for
victims
of
the
camp
fire
which
has
so
far
killed
people
and
burned
acres
hectares
fire
fighters
have
said
it
was
only
percent
contained
authorities
said
they
have
not
accounted
for
nearly
people
on
wednesday
a
national
guard
contingent
was
sent
to
paradise
a
town
of
about
in
the
sierra
foothills
that
has
been
largely
reduced
to
ashes
to
seek
and
identify
human
remains
they
will
join
the
cadaver
dogs
recovery
teams
and
forensic
anthropologists
searching
the
ghostly
landscape
ic
appeared
agitated
as
he
was
instructed
to
sniff
inside
a
car
and
a
pile
of
rubble
from
the
destroyed
house
a
brick
chimney
and
burned
trees
the
only
things
standing
on
the
property
moutard
said
that
she
and
ic
had
previously
only
worked
house
fires
and
the
dog
was
overwhelmed
by
the
size
of
the
search
area
and
multitude
of
scents
from
what
was
left
of
house
after
house
she
said
her
method
was
to
look
for
places
where
people
may
be
trapped
by
fire
such
as
front
and
back
doorways
or
where
they
might
take
shelter
such
as
a
bathtub
i
generally
try
to
look
at
what
s
going
to
be
the
catch
point
for
someone
in
a
home
she
said
she
stays
alert
for
obvious
body
parts
that
would
survive
fire
skulls
often
but
also
looks
for
imprints
of
bodies
a
discolored
area
in
the
shape
of
a
human
that
may
be
the
most
obvious
remnant
in
a
fire
like
this
it
may
just
simply
appear
as
an
outline
she
said
what
may
be
left
is
just
literally
the
outline
of
a
a
team
karen
and
larry
atkinson
worked
their
way
through
devastated
properties
near
eden
roc
drive
in
paradise
with
their
dog
echo
an
english
lab
echo
dashed
ahead
nose
to
the
ground
and
then
returned
to
karen
who
would
point
the
dog
toward
the
next
place
to
be
searched
she
periodically
shook
talcum
powder
from
a
bottle
to
test
the
direction
of
the
wind
and
make
sure
the
dog
searched
the
downwind
side
of
each
location
so
it
would
be
easier
to
pick
up
scents
as
they
searched
the
atkinsons
stayed
alert
for
hazards
downed
power
lines
holes
left
by
burned
roots
and
dangling
tree
branches
which
they
called
widow
larry
atkinson
said
the
search
was
painstaking
because
echo
was
working
through
many
scents
to
single
out
human
remains
there
s
a
lot
of
scent
everywhere
and
it
s
hard
to
nail
down
