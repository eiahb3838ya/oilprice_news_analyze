reuters
tesla
inc
has
cut
prices
on
its
residential
solar
systems
by
as
much
as
percent
in
a
bid
to
lift
lagging
sales
after
the
company
streamlined
its
sales
and
marketing
organization
a
company
official
told
reuters
on
thursday
effective
on
thursday
price
quotes
for
potential
solar
customers
will
be
between
and
lower
representing
savings
of
about
to
percent
according
to
sanjay
shah
the
company
s
senior
vice
president
of
energy
operations
tesla
said
the
to
in
savings
was
an
average
and
that
the
actual
amount
could
be
lower
or
higher
depending
on
the
size
of
the
rooftop
system
and
where
a
home
is
located
since
tesla
s
acquisition
two
years
ago
of
solarcity
which
at
the
time
was
the
largest
residential
solar
company
the
company
has
sharply
cut
the
vast
sales
organization
that
underpinned
its
rapid
growth
last
year
tesla
stopped
selling
solar
and
earlier
this
year
it
ended
a
deal
to
sell
solar
at
home
depot
inc
stores
a
relationship
that
some
analysts
estimated
brought
in
roughly
half
of
tesla
s
solar
sales
but
added
up
to
to
the
cost
of
a
residential
system
that
has
come
alongside
a
big
drop
in
installations
tesla
deployed
just
megawatts
of
solar
in
the
third
quarter
down
from
solarcity
s
more
than
mw
a
quarter
in
early
shah
said
that
with
lower
prices
customers
will
seek
out
tesla
at
its
stores
and
online
every
customer
wants
a
greater
value
in
terms
of
price
he
said
when
you
do
that
the
customer
comes
to
you
rather
than
you
going
to
the
he
said
the
price
cuts
should
make
tesla
highly
competitive
and
added
that
the
company
ultimately
wants
to
be
the
solar
provider
in
the
united
states
solar
energy
systems
from
large
installers
on
average
are
about
percent
more
expensive
than
those
sold
by
smaller
companies
according
to
a
report
by
the
national
renewable
energy
laboratory
a
government
research
lab
shah
said
tesla
s
premium
solar
products
are
more
efficient
than
most
other
panels
and
should
not
be
compared
with
standard
systems
on
price
the
price
cuts
are
made
possible
in
part
by
the
savings
tesla
has
produced
from
streamlining
its
sales
operations
by
selling
directly
through
its
website
and
roughly
retail
stores
tesla
has
been
able
to
cut
sales
and
marketing
costs
in
half
shah
said
shah
joined
the
company
six
months
ago
from
inc
and
has
focused
on
making
its
solar
supply
chain
more
efficient
reducing
sales
and
marketing
costs
and
bringing
down
the
time
it
takes
for
rooftop
systems
to
be
installed
he
said
tesla
shares
closed
percent
higher
at
on
the
nasdaq
on
thursday
