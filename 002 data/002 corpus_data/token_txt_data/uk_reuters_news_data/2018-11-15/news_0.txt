the
british
pound
lay
battered
in
asia
on
friday
after
a
bout
of
political
turmoil
fanned
fears
the
country
could
crash
out
of
the
european
union
without
a
divorce
deal
asian
share
markets
looked
set
to
fare
better
as
hopes
for
a
thaw
in
trade
relations
gave
wall
street
a
fillip
though
there
were
duelling
reports
on
the
prospects
for
an

sterling
stole
the
limelight
after
a
rash
of
resignations
rocked
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
government
and
threw
into
doubt
her
brexit
agreement
just
hours
after
it
was
unveiled
fears
that
may
s
deal
could
collapse
sent
british
markets
into
gyrations
not
seen
since
the
june
referendum
on
eu
membership
the
pound
suffered
its
worst
loss
against
the

since

listed
just
some
of

s
woes
if

when
a
vote
on
the
withdrawal
agreement
occurs
is
uncertain
whether
the
withdrawal
bill
is
passed
by
both
houses
of
parliament
is
whether
the
prime
minister
resigns
or
is
challenged
for
the
leadership
is
uncertain
and
whether
there
is
a
second
referendum
an
election
is
all
of
which
helped
british
bonds
rally
sharply
as
investors
wagered
the
political
chaos
and
risk
of
a
hard
brexit
would
deter
the
bank
of
england
from
tightening
anytime
soon
