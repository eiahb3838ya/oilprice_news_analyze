national
guard
troops
joined
the
grim
search
on
wednesday
for
more
victims
in
the
ruins
of
an
incinerated
northern
california
town
while
the
death
toll
climbed
to
in
the
most
deadly
and
destructive
wildfire
in
the
state
s
history
the
latest
fatality
count
was
announced
as
authorities
released
a
revised
list
of
people
reported
missing
by
loved
ones
after
flames
largely
obliterated
the
sierra
foothills
town
of
paradise
about
miles
km
north
of
san
francisco
last
thursday
the
majority
on
the
list
were
over
the
age
of
nearly
people
were
initially
reported
as
missing
in
the
killer
blaze
dubbed
the
camp
fire
most
of
those
who
remain
unaccounted
for
are
from
paradise
once
home
to
people
more
than
homes
and
other
buildings
burned
to
the
ground
in
and
around
paradise
and
an
estimated
people
remained
under
evacuation
orders
in
the
area
adding
to
the
misery
of
some
survivors
was
an
outbreak
of
norovirus
a
highly
contagious
gastrointestinal
illness
at
a
shelter
housing
about
evacuees
in
the
nearby
city
of
chico
public
health
agency
spokeswoman
lisa
almaguer
said
at
least
people
may
have
caught
the
virus
the
footprint
of
the
fire
grew
to
acres
hectares
as
of
wednesday
even
as
diminished
winds
and
rising
humidity
helped
firefighters
shore
up
containment
lines
around
more
than
a
third
of
the
perimeter
still
the
ghostly
expanse
of
empty
lots
covered
in
ash
and
strewn
with
twisted
wreckage
and
debris
made
a
strong
impression
on
governor
jerry
brown
interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
and
other
officials
who
toured
the
devastation
on
wednesday
this
is
one
of
the
worst
disasters
i
ve
seen
in
my
career
hands
down
brock
long
head
of
the
federal
emergency
management
agency
told
reporters
in
chico
it
looks
like
a
war
zone
it
is
a
war
zone
brown
said
after
visiting
some
of
california
s
earlier
wildfire
zones
in
august
zinke
blamed
gross
mismanagement
of
forests
because
of
timber
harvest
restrictions
that
he
said
were
supported
by
environmental
terrorist
but
pressed
by
reporters
on
wednesday
zinke
demurred
now
is
really
not
the
time
to
point
fingers
he
said
it
is
a
time
for
america
to
stand
the
blaze
fueled
by
thick
scrub
has
capped
two
catastrophic
wildfire
seasons
in
california
that
scientists
largely
attribute
to
prolonged
drought
they
say
is
symptomatic
of
climate
change
lawyers
for
some
of
the
victims
claimed
in
a
lawsuit
filed
on
wednesday
that
lax
equipment
maintenance
by
an
electric
utility
was
the
proximate
cause
of
the
fire
which
officially
remains
under
investigation
the
butte
county
disaster
coincided
with
a
flurry
of
blazes
in
southern
california
most
notably
the
woolsey
fire
which
has
killed
at
least
two
people
destroyed
more
than
structures
and
displaced
about
people
in
the
mountains
and
foothills
near
the
malibu
coast
west
of
los
angeles
on
wednesday
the
los
angeles
county
sheriff
s
department
said
the
body
of
a
possible
third
victim
was
found
there
in
a
dwelling
cal
fire
officials
said
that
blaze
was
percent
contained
as
of
wednesday
night
in
butte
county
the
search
for
more
human
remains
kicked
into
high
gear
as
a
national
guard
contingent
of
military
police
officers
joined
dozens
of
workers
and
at
least
cadaver
dogs
sheriff
kory
honea
said
the
remains
of
eight
more
fire
victims
were
found
on
wednesday
raising
the
official
number
of
fatalities
to
far
exceeding
the
previous
record
from
a
single
wildfire
in
california
history
people
killed
by
the
griffith
park
fire
in
los
angeles
in
the
camp
fire
also
stands
as
one
of
the
deadliest
wildfires
since
the
turn
of
the
last
century
more
than
people
perished
in
the
big
burn
firestorm
that
swept
the
northern
rockies
in
august
of
butte
county
sheriff
s
spokeswoman
megan
mcmann
said
the
list
of
missing
would
fluctuate
from
day
to
day
as
more
names
are
added
and
others
are
removed
either
because
they
turn
up
safe
or
end
up
identified
among
the
dead
sheriff
honea
invited
relatives
of
the
missing
to
provide
dna
samples
to
compare
against
samples
taken
from
newly
recovered
remains
in
hopes
of
speeding
up
identification
of
the
dead
but
he
acknowledged
it
was
possible
some
of
the
missing
might
never
be
found
authorities
attributed
the
magnitude
of
casualties
to
the
staggering
speed
with
which
the
fire
struck
paradise
flames
roared
through
town
so
swiftly
that
residents
were
forced
to
flee
for
their
lives
some
victims
were
found
in
or
around
the
wreckage
of
their
vehicles
