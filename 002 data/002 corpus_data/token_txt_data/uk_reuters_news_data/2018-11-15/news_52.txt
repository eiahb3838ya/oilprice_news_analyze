on
saturday
nearly
two
decades
after
securing
the
initial
rights
total
s
ceo
patrick
pouyanné
was
in
luanda
to
snip
the
ribbon
on
a
billion
oil
project
it
s
not
clear
when
he
or
his
peers
will
be
cracking
open
the
bubbly
in
angola
again
without
another
like
total
s
kaombo
on
the
horizon
and
fields
getting
old
africa
s
crude
producer
is
facing
a
steep
decline
unless
it
can
revive
exploration
in
what
was
once
one
of
the
world
s
most
exciting
offshore
prospects
sonangol
the
state
oil
company
is
negotiating
contracts
for
new
blocks
with
oil
majors
and
angola
plans
to
hold
an
auction
next
year
the
first
tender
for
exploration
rights
since
it
s
a
race
against
time
for
a
country
where
oil
accounts
for
percent
of
exports
and
around
percent
of
government
revenues
luck
will
also
play
a
part
as
it
always
does
in
exploration
where
finding
oil
can
never
be
guaranteed
but
without
new
projects
output
could
fall
to
million
barrels
per
day
by
according
to
the
oil
ministry
that
is
down
from
million
today
and
nearly
half
of
what
angola
was
producing
a
decade
ago
the
country
risks
having
its
opec
quota
cut
and
is
struggling
to
ensure
the
feed
for
its
billion
liquid
natural
gas
plant
president
joão
lourenço
won
an
august
election
promising
an
economic
miracle
in
angola
which
despite
its
oil
wealth
struggles
to
provide
basic
services
to
a
mostly
impoverished
population
that
is
growing
at
percent
a
year
but
falling
oil
production
means
a
third
consecutive
contraction
is
expected
in
even
while
annual
inflation
runs
at
percent
to
turn
things
around
angola
has
asked
international
oil
companies
to
the
table
offering
better
fiscal
terms
and
more
collaboration
with
the
time
from
exploration
to
first
oil
on
new
areas
anything
from
five
to
years
angola
is
also
offering
tax
breaks
to
encourage
companies
to
link
existing
marginal
discoveries
to
operating
production
platforms
there
are
signs
the
measures
are
working
though
some
oil
experts
wonder
at
what
cost
for
the
southwest
african
country
the
level
of
exploration
activity
in
angola
is
beginning
to
change
sonangol
s
chairman
carlos
saturnino
said
at
saturday
s
inauguration
he
expects
between
five
and
new
concessions
to
be
signed
next
year
exxon
he
said
has
shown
interest
in
some
blocks
in
southern

unexplored
namib
basin
while
advanced
discussions
are
being
held
with
bp
equinor
and
eni
for
the
rights
to
the

plans
to
drill
its
first
exploration
well
in
four
years
beneath
metres
of
water
on

it
will
be
one
of
the
world
s
deepest
we
hope
it
will
be
a
for
the
in
angola
said
andré
goffart
senior
for
development
we
are
seeing
a
new
wave
of
exploration
in
these
signs
of
fresh
exploration
come
after
a
period
of
due
to
a
lack
of
drilling
success
a
slump
in
oil
prices
and
a
deteriorating
relationship
between
sonangol
and
the
oil
majors
angola
s
offshore
reserves
are
expensive
to
explore
and
develop
making
it
a
hard
sell
for
shareholders
when
oil
is
at
the
number
of
rigs
operating
off
angola
s
shores
dropped
from
in
early
to
just
two
in
according
to
oil
services
company
baker
hughes
the
steep
drop
in
prices
from
came
just
as
companies
were
smarting
from
the
failure
to
discover
oil
reservoirs
beneath
a
layer
of
salt
on
the
african
side
of
the
atlantic
the
search
for
the
angolan
resulted
in
some
of
the
most
expensive
dry
wells
ever
drilled
and
sapped
exploration
appetite
critics
say
the
situation
was
exacerbated
by
isabel
dos
santos
the
former
president
s
daughter
and
previous
chair
of
sonangol
under
whose
leadership
new
projects
ground
to
a
halt
dos
santos
denies
allegations
of
mismanagement
saying
she
helped
turn
around
an
almost
bankrupt
company
there
are
few
places
in
the
world
right
now
where
the
oil
majors
are
in
as
good
a
negotiating
position
as
here
said
one
international
oil
executive
in
luanda
on
condition
of
anonymity
some
local
experts
fear
the
deals
angola
is
striking
are
too
beneficial
for
the
companies
although
details
remain
private
if
angola
gives
away
too
much
it
could
create
problems
further
down
the
line
said
josé
oliveira
an
oil
specialist
at
the
catholic
university
in
luanda
but
the
country
has
little
choice
given
its
imminent
production
decline
and
a
lack
of
money
or
expertise
to
lead
the
drilling
campaigns
itself
asked
if
he
will
be
back
in
the
next
few
years
to
launch
another
giant
project
like
kaombo
total

we
