sterling
tumbled
and
the
rest
of
europe
s
share
markets
groaned
on
thursday
after
a
brexit
agreement
was
thrown
into
chaos
as
britain
s
chief
negotiator
for
the
deal
quit
just
hours
after
it
had
been
unveiled
up
until
that
point
markets
had
looked
relatively
calm
asia
had
cheered
news
that
china
and
the
united
states
were
back
in
contact
about
their
trade
dispute
and
oil
was
inching
up
again
having
halted
a
record
losing
streak
but
then
came
the
hammer
blow
with
brexit
minister
dominic
raab
quitting
in
protest
at
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
deal
for
leaving
the
european
union
no
democratic
nation
has
ever
signed
up
to
be
bound
by
such
an
extensive
regime
imposed
externally
without
any
democratic
control
over
the
laws
to
be
applied
nor
the
ability
to
decide
to
exit
the
arrangement

the
rest
of
europe
sank
swiftly
into
the
red
the
reaction
is
sterling
shows
that
the
chance
of
no
brexit
deal
has
spiked
said
tim

head

at
state
street
global
markets
it
also
introduces
thoughts
of
a
leadership
challenge
for
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
which
seems
likely
the
turmoil
also
boosted
demand
for
german
government
bonds
yields
on
what
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
safest
assets
in
the
world
fell
over
three
basis
points
to
percent
its
lowest
in
over
two
weeks
uk
government
bonds
saw
a
rush
of
demand
too
with
the
reflex
dive
for
cover
and
the
sight
of
state
owned
bank
rbs
stocks
down
almost
percent
drove
the
biggest
fall
in
yields
since
just
after
the
june
brexit
vote
eu
leaders
had
said
they
would
meet
on
to
endorse
the
divorce
deal
but
may
now
faces
the
much
more
perilous
struggle
of
getting
parliament
to
approve
what
was
agreed

investors
were
also
starting
to
look
ahead
to

where

were
pointing

ahead
of
