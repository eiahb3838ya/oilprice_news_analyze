washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
s
nominee
to
join
a
key
panel
of
independent
energy
regulators
who
helped
roll
out
a
department
of
energy
doe
directive
to
bail
out
aging
coal
and
nuclear
plants
told
senators
on
thursday
he
did
not
know
if
he
would
recuse
himself
if
the
issue
reappears
before
the
commission
last
month
trump
nominated
bernard
mcnamee
currently
a
lawyer
at
the
doe
to
a
vacant
seat
on
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
ferc
which
is
meant
to
be
a
politically
independent
office
when
he
was
the
doe
s
deputy
general
counsel
last
year
mcnamee
helped
to
role
out
a
directive
from
energy
secretary
rick
perry
to
subsidize
aging
coal
and
nuclear
plants
for
attributes
including
making
the
power
grid
resilient
the
plan
was
bashed
by
a
mix
of
natural
gas
renewable
power
and
consumer
advocates
ferc
ultimately
rejected
the
plan
mcnamee
a
republican
this
year
wrote
an
editorial
on
the
virtues
of
fossil
fuels
like
coal
gas
and
oil
the
piece
said
renewable
energy
like
wind
and
solar
power
was
important
but
questioned
whether
they
could
replace
other
energy
resources
critics
say
mcnamee
s
participation
in
perry
s
directive
and
his
editorial
make
him
biased
toward
fossil
fuels
a
claim
he
rejected
asked
at
a
senate
hearing
on
his
nomination
whether
he
would
recuse
himself
if
he
is
confirmed
and
if
the
resilience
issue
comes
up
again
at
ferc
mcnamee
said
he
was
not
sure
i
don
t
know
if
anything
is
going
to
be
proposed
so
i
can
t
say
what
i
would
or
would
not
do
mcnamee
said
i
commit
i
will
talk
with
ethics
counsel
to
find
out
if
i
need
to
recuse
mcnamee
said
his
decisions
will
be
based
on
the
law
and
the
facts
not
markets
are
the
best
way
to
allocate
resources
and
set
prices
and
i
am
committed
to
continuing
ferc
s
independence
he
added
senator
angus
king
an
independent
from
maine
said
law
dictates
that
mcnamee
should
disqualify
himself
on
the
issue
because
he
had
participated
in
government
counsel
on
it
with
the
doe
king
told
mcnamee
he
was
surprised
and
disappointed
that
you
feel
that
you
have
to
consult
with
counsel
on
something
that
s
so
senator
lisa
murkowski
of
alaska
a
republican
and
chair
of
the
senate
energy
committee
told
mcnamee
that
if
he
is
confirmed
she
expected
him
to
make
sure
ferc
was
not
tipping
the
scales
for
any
energy
source

on
a
political
