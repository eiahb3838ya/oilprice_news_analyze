and

shipped

from

and

but
the
firm
which
supplies
percent
of
china
s
gas
has
suffered
losses
in
its
import
business
as
the
global
prices
it
pays
are
often
above
state
regulated
domestic

in
the
first
nine
months
of
petrochina
booked

during
the
first
six
months
of
reported
net
profit
of
billion
yuan
up
percent
from
the
same
period
a
year
earlier
according
to
its
financial
report
this
shall
boost
petrochina
s
lagging
gas
retail
business
and
cut
heavy
losses
at
the
wholesale
department
said
one
of
the
three
executives
on
kunlun
released
a
statement
to
the
hong
kong
stock
exchange
discussing
natural
gas
business
development
strategies
that
states
petrochina
s
wholesale
and
retail
sales
businesses
will
be
operated
independently
the
statement
adds
that
as
of
the
date
of
the
announcement
kunlun
has
no
intention
to
transfer
any
petrochina
assets
in
connection
with
the
strategy
kunlun
did
not
immediately
respond
to
an
email
requesting
comment
on
the
restructuring
sent
after
business
hours
still
the
restructuring
worries
smaller
independent
firms
such
as
china
resources
gas
group
china
gas
holdings
and
enn
energy
holdings
that
are
fearful
the
move
could
squeeze
supplies
in
a
fast
growing
market
and
create
a
monopoly
wholesaler
it
will
dramatically
alter
the
market
structure
as
petrochina
will
no
doubt
prioritize
kunlun
as
its
top
customer
at
the
expense
of
other
buyers
said
another
of
the
executives
who
is
with
an
independent
gas
distributor
the
move
is
petrochina
s
response
to
a
government
plan
to
create
a
national
gas
pipeline
company
by
consolidating
the
country
s
trunk
pipeline
assets
of
which
petrochina
controls
nearly
percent
the
integration
means
kunlun
will
receive
support
from
the
supply
side
and
vice
versa
the
sales
group
will
have
a
deeper
penetration
into
the
retail
including
city
gas
distribution
gas
refilling
stations
said
the
third
source
nearly
provincial
wholesale
operations
of
the
gas
sales
company
will
be
merged
with
the
similar
number
of
provincial
outlets
under
kunlun
