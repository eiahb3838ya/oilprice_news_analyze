australia
has
readied
its
stretched
power
grid
to
cope
with
a
summer
with
extra
electricity
supply
lined
up
for
the
system
in
case
of
disruptions
the
energy
market
operator
said
in
a
statement
on
friday
this
is
the
second
year
the
australian
energy
market
operator
aemo
has
taken
extra
steps
to
prepare
for
summer
by
beefing
up
power
reserves
to
offset
intermittent
wind
and
solar
generators
and
outages
at
ageing
plants
blackouts
hit
the
country
s
southeastern
states
in
and
the
worst
of
which
hit
the
entire
state
of
south
australia
and
shut
top
global
miner
bhp
s
olympic
dam
copper
mine
for
two
weeks
costing
it
million
the
bureau
of
meteorology
is
forecasting
a
hotter
and
drier
summer
which
coupled
with
other
risks
we
have
identified
suggests
we
have
a
challenging
summer
awaiting
us
aemo
chief
executive
audrey
zibelman
said
australian
power
demand
typically
soars
in
the
southern
hemisphere
summer
as
households
and
businesses
crank
up
air
conditioning
at
the
same
time
generation
transmission
and
distribution
networks
can
be
hit
by
bushfires
and
storms
australia
s
bureau
of
meteorology
said
in
a
seasonal
forecast
on
thursday
that
the
summer
will
be
hotter
than
normal
days
and
nights
are
likely
for
almost
all
of
australia
for
december
to
february
it
said
aemo
said
in
august
the
states
of
victoria
and
south
australia
were
most
at
risk
for
outages
this
summer
with
some
threat
in
the
most
populous
state
of
new
south
wales
where
drought
has
depleted
hydropower
dams
to
help
prevent
blackouts
the
operator
has
secured
megawatts
mw
of
reserve
power
in
part
by
making
agreements
with
some
energy
users
to
curb
use
when
supplies
are
tight
aemo
is
confident
the
plans
we
have
made
have
appropriately
equipped
us
to
tackle
any
unforeseen
events
the
upcoming
summer
might
bring
zibelman
said
in
the
statement
last
summer
lining
up
and
activating
reserve
supplies
cost
the
market
operator
a
million
million
which
it
then
passed
on
in
fees
to
customers
in
south
australia
and
victoria
costs
for
the
reserves
are
expected
to
fall
this
year
aemo
said
partly
because
it
has
not
had
to
line
up
as
much
supply
as
last
year
as
mw
of
new
generation
capacity
has
come
onto
the
market
over
the
past
year
australia
s
drought
is
not
expected
to
impact
power
generation
this
summer
