seeking

strike
back
at

arabia
over
the
death
of
a
saudi
journalist
at
a

in
turkey
and
for
its
role
in
yemen
s
devastating
civil
war

suspend

prohibit
refueling
of
saudi
coalition
aircraft
for
riyadh
s
campaign

access
in
yemen
and
anyone
supporting
the
houthis
in
yemen
sponsored
by
three
republican
and
three
democratic
senators
the
legislation
reflects
continued
dissatisfaction
in
the
congress
over
the
yemen
war
which
has
killed
more
than
people
and
created
the
world
s
most
urgent
humanitarian
crisis
that
frustration
was
exacerbated
by
the
killing
in
october
at
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
a
resident
who
wrote
for
the
washington
post
senator
bob
menendez
the
top
democrat
on
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
said
sanctions
on
saudis
announced
earlier
on
thursday
by
president
donald
trump
s
administration
were
not
enough
to
ensure
a
credible
investigation
of
khashoggi
s
death
and
an
end
to
hostilities
in
yemen
we
are
putting
teeth
behind
these
demands
with
regular
oversight
sanctions
and
suspension
of
weapons
sales
and
refueling
support
he
said
in
a
statement
this
legislation
is
an
important
way
to
hold
saudi
arabia
accountable
for
various
acts
in
yemen
as
well
as
the
death
of
jamal
khashoggi
