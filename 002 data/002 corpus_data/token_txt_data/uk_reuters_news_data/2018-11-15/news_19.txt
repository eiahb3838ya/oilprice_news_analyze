the

weekly

and
the

released
more

from
its

the
data
showed
a
good
chunk
of

coast
as

activity
dropped

referring
to
the
region
s
build
common
themes
are
threaded
through
this
report
as
in
recent
weeks
another
spr
release
and
another
increase
to
domestic
the
department
of
energy
had
offered
about
million
barrels
of
oil
for
sale
from
the
nation
s
strategic
petroleum
reserve
spr
to
be
delivered
between
through

those
barrels
have
now
been
arriving
in
the
market
traders

inventories
in
the

dropped
by
about
million
barrels
last
week
to
the
lowest
level
since
according
to
eia
data
oil
prices
however
held
gains
after
the
bearish
build
in
crude
as
the
market
focused
instead
on
the
decline
in
fuel
stockpiles
obviously
the
headline
crude
build
was
shocking
but
the
market
is
not
falling
apart
in
part
due
to
the
fact
that
we
saw
big
drops
in
gasoline
supplies
and
distillate
fuels
the
products
are
definitely
supporting
us
right
now
