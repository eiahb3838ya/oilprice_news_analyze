the
oil
market
is
scrambling
to
adjust
to
a
deep
selloff
over
the
last
several
weeks
with
forward
prices
signaling
a
supply
glut
which
could
upend
plans
for
producers
and
traders
through
crude
futures
plunged
percent
on
tuesday
to
settle
at
their
lowest
level
this
year
down
from
a
high
only
a
month
ago
tuesday
marked
a
straight
session
of
declines
which
is
the
longest
losing
streak
on
record
shaking
a
market
that
was
bracing
for
supply
shortfalls
just
a
month
ago
we
were
definitely
in
the
bullish
narrative
for
the
past
three
months
and
now
we
re
seeing
that
narrative
shift
said
michael
cohen
head
of
energy
markets
research
at
barclays
if
the
narrative
gets
unwound
or
undermined
so
too
does
the
positioning
by
the
in
the
biggest
sign
of
the
shift
an
increasing
number
of
futures
contracts
are
trading
at
a
premium
to
current
prices
that
is
a
signal
that
the
market
expects
supply
to
outpace
demand
next
year
and
into
that
trend
could
inhibit
producers
from
drilling
and
deal
a
blow
to
shale
companies
which
have
raked
in
profits
as
production
surged
to
a
weekly
record
of
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
early
november
already
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
is
considering
a
production
cut
to
boost
prices
adding
to
concerns
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
wednesday
that
supply
will
outpace
demand
in
i
think
there
s
a
genuine
shift
one
trader
at
a
top
commodities
merchant
said
everyone
is
talking
about
global
oil
builds
in
many
traders
saw
oil
on
the
horizon
just
a
month
ago
but
oil
is
now
closer
to
a
barrel
production
is
expected
to
surpass
the
million
bpd
milestone
by
according
to
energy
information
administration
forecasts
as
prices
fall
and
market
structure
weakens
shale
producers
may
pare
their
drilling
plans
for

research
director
for
lower

mackenzie
i
think
instead
of
a
big
into
next
year
we
get
flatter
activity
than
what
we
might
have
seen
otherwise
he
said
still
any
changes
would
take
time
to
alter
the
trajectory
of
production
especially
as
the
largest
oil
companies
including
exxon
mobil
corp
and
chevron
corp
are
increasing
activity
in
shale
plays
the
weakening
in
contracts
pushes
the
market
s
structure
or
curve
more
firmly
into
contango
where
forward
prices
are
higher
than
spot
prices
contango
is
a
symptom
of
an
oversupplied
oil
market
or
rising
levels
of
inventories
it
makes
it
more
profitable
for
crude
traders
to
store
large
volumes
of
oil
for
later
rather
than
sell
for
immediate
use
the
spread
between
crude
futures
expiring
in
december
and
december
a
popular
trade
in
oil
markets
flipped
from
a
premium
to
a
discount
of
about
cents
on
tuesday
it
is
the
first
time
the
spread
traded
in
negative
territory
since
october
crude
for
delivery
in
december
plunged
to
trade
as
much
as
a
barrel
below
futures
for
delivery
in
june
last
week
the
widest
spread
on
record
the
december
contract
dropped
to
trade
as
much
as
per
barrel
below
the
december
contract
last
week
the
widest
since
early
a
change
in
the
market
structure
has
ramifications
for
investors
as
well
when
contracts
trade
below
the
spot
price
funds
and
other
investors
benefit
from
what
is
known
as
positive
roll
in
that
situation
funds
holding
a
contract
shift
into
the
next
month
s
contract
before
it
expires
profiting
from
buying
the
cheaper
futures
but
with
those
contracts
now
more
expensive
rolling
the
long
positions
forward
is
less
lucrative
and
is
one
reason
why
traders
have
pulled
back
on
bullish
bets
