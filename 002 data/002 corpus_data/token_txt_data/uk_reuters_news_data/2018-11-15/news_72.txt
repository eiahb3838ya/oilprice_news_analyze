london
reuters
premier
oil
said
on
thursday
it
expected
production
to
come
in
at
the
low
end
of
a
previously
announced
to
barrels
per
day
range
the
company
which
has
been
focussing
on
cutting
debts
also
said
its
debt
pile
would
shrink
to
billion
by
the
premier
s
debt
reduction
this
year
was
broadly
in
line
with
its
target
of
million
and
chief
executive
tony
durrant
told
reuters
he
saw
net
debt
reduction
next
year
in
that
range
as
well
when
asked
when
premier
might
reinstate
dividends
durrant
said
net
debt
below
billion
would
feel
comfortable
but
that
payouts
would
have
to
be
weighed
against
investment
in
growth
in
mexico
the
falkland
islands
and
indonesia
the
company
has
not
paid
dividends
since
premier
is
starting
drilling
later
this
month
to
appraise
its
resources
in
mexico
s
huge
zama
field
and
expects
results
on
the
extent
and
depth
of
the
reservoir
as
well
as
flow
test
data
in
around
a
hundred
days
durrant
said
premier
remains
our
preferred
brent
oil
price
play
providing
leverage
to
strong
oil
prices
through
debt
reduction
and
accelerated

in

premier
has
hedged
around
percent
of
its
output
at
a
price
of
per
barrel
for
the
first
half
of
next
year
and
per

for
the
second
half
it
said
on
the
production
outlook
bmo
analysts
said
the
headline
is
a
reduction
to
production
guidance
as
premier
is
likely
to
be
more
impacted
by
a
volatile
commodity
backdrop
although
at
our
brent
forecast
of
the
shares
look
good
premier

shares
were
