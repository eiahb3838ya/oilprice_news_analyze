u.s. shale surge boosts industry finances, puts deals in spotlight
reuters
if
opec
thought
the
percent
drop
in
oil
prices
since
october
might
rein
in
shale
production
like
the
last
sharp
drop
did
four
years
ago
it
might
have
to
think
again
shale
firms
are
more
profitable
than
ever
after
a
strong
third
quarter
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of
results
for
independent
producers
these
companies
are
producing
more
efficiently
generating
more
cash
flow
and
consolidating
in
a
wave
of
mergers
the
data
show
results
at
independent
shale
explorers
show
nearly
a
third
generated
more
cash
from
operations
than
they
spent
on
drilling
and
shareholder
payouts
a
group
including
devon
energy
eog
resources
and
continental
resources
a
year
ago
there
were
just
three
companies
on
that
list
the
group
s
cash
flow
deficit
has
narrowed
to
million
as
benchmark
crude
hit
a
barrel
and
production
soared
the
group
overspent
by
three
times
as
much
as
recently
as
june
and
was
billion
in
the
hole
a
year
ago
according
to
reuters
analysis
of
morningstar
data
provided
by
the
institute
for
energy
economics
and
financial
analysis
the
change
is
evidence
shale
firms
have
moved
to
harvest
mode
after
shareholders
pressured
them
to
rein
in
spending
and
increase
payouts

the
industry
is
starting
to
do
opec
s
worry
while
shale
producers
have
fortified
their
finances
opec
and
allied
producing
countries
this
week
began
discussing
an
output
cut
of
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
stem
the
sharp
slide
in
crude
prices
crude
was
trading
at
a
barrel
on
thursday
down
from
its
october
high
opec
last
sought
to
drive
out
shale
producers
by
flooding
the
market
with
oil
in
that
production
lasted
nearly
two
years
sending
crude
to
below
a
barrel
but
while
it
bloodied
shale
it
led
the
industry
to
become
among
the
globe
s
oil
producers
now
any
opec
output
cuts
that
lift
global
prices
should
benefit
shale
producers
they
have
become
so
lean
they
can
profit
on
each
new
barrel
of
oil
pumped
from
west
texas
shale
fields
at
a
barrel
and
from
north
dakota
s
bakken
field
at
a
barrel
according
to
rs
energy
group
rather
than
slowing
shale
production
the
latest
price
drop
could
hasten
industry
consolidation
as
bigger
producers
snap
up
weaker
rivals
the
small
guys
are
going
to
go
away
through
mergers

john
groton
