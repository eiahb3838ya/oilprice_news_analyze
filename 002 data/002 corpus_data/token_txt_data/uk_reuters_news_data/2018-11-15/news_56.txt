column-natural gas looks like the iea's big winner, but threats abound: russell

there
was
something
for
everyone
in
the
international
energy
agency
s
iea
s
latest
world
energy
outlook
but
supporters
of
coal
renewables
and
oil
and
gas
are
all
likely
to
take
away
the
wrong
messages
the
comprehensive
report
released
on
outlined
an
energy
future
where
natural
gas
overtakes
coal
by
to
become
the
world
s
energy
source
there
was
positive
news
for
renewables
as
well
with
the
agency
forecasting
that
the
sector
would
overtake
coal
in
power
generation
by
with
a
share
of
just
over
percent
even
if
this
sounded
like
bad
news
for
coal
the
iea
still
believed
that
use
of
the
fuel
will
remain
largely
flat
over
the
forecast
period
as
gains
in
asia
are
offset
by
declines
in
europe
and
north
america
if
this
forecast
is
correct
it
means
countries
focused
on
asia
such
as
australia
indonesia
and
south
africa
can
look
forward
to
years
of
solid
demand
there
were
two
caveats
in
the
report
however
that
show
the
reality
of
the
next
two
decades
of
global
energy
consumption
could
potentially
be
quite
different
from
the
forecasts
the
first
was
that
carbon
emissions
continue
to
grow
under
the
iea
s
main
scenario
on
a
slow
upward
trend
to
which
will
be
a
trajectory
far
out
of
step
with
what
scientific
knowledge
says
will
be
required
to
tackle
climate
following
on
from
that
thought
was
an
acknowledgement
that
government
policies
across
the
world
will
drive
the
future
of
energy
production
and
consumption
government
policies
and
preferences
will
play
a
crucial
role
in
shaping
where
we
go
from
here
the
iea
said
it
s
here
that
the
tide
would
appear
to
be
shifting
in
favour
of
stronger
action
to
mitigate
climate
change
especially
in
countries
such
as
china
and
india
where
energy
demand
is
expected
to
grow
strongly
the
world
s
two
most
populous
nations
both
battle
air
pollution
largely
blamed
on
burning
coal
for
both
power
and
industry
as
well
as
rising
vehicle
emissions
as
the
emerging
middle
class
buys
more
cars
china
already
has
stringent
policies
in
place
to
lower
air
pollution
over
winter
such
as
closing
down
steelmaking
and
aluminium
plants
and
switching
residential
heating
to
natural
gas
from
coal
india
is
probably
not
too
far
behind
given
that
its
capital
new
delhi
is
now
more
polluted
than
beijing
while
there
are
governments
and
leaders
that
deny
climate
change
such
as
president
donald
trump
and
australian
prime
minister
scott
morrison
they
are
becoming
exceptions
rather
than
the
rule
the
risks
to
the
iea
scenario
appear
to
be
stacked
in
favour
of
a
adoption
of
renewable
energy
mainly
at
the
expense
of
coal
and
natural
gas
in
power
generation
and
of
crude
oil
for
transportation
the
trend
of
the
past
decade
has
been
coal
losing
favour
as
renewables
and
natural
gas
expand
their
market
share
the
natural
gas
industry
has
been
quite
happy
to
target
coal
bolstered
by
the
fact
it
is
less
polluting
and
increasingly
available
especially
after
the
shale
gas
boom
in
the
united
states
and
the
subsequent
massive
investment
in
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
there
and
in
places
like
australia
the
risk
to
the
gas
industry
is
that
in
its
glee
to
kill
off
coal
it
isn
t
seeing
renewables
in
the
rearview
mirror
the
september
gastech
event
in
barcelona
was
a
case
in
point
this
was
the
gas
industry
s
largest
annual
gathering
and
featured
dozens
of
speakers
from
the
major
players
the
standout
theme
of
the
conference
was
the
absolute
confidence
the
natural
gas
and
lng
industries
have
in
their
future
and
that
they
are
not
just
a
transition
fuel
between
coal
and
renewables
but
are
a
permanent
part
of
the
energy
landscape
the
report
on
the
event
and
its
various
sessions
mentioned
the
word
renewables
only
three
times
solar
and
wind
didn
t
appear
in
the
document
at
all
climate
change
was
mentioned
just
once
and
only
in
relation
to
limiting
emissions
from
methane
leakage
the
report
gives
the
impression
that
the
natural
gas
industry
is
largely
ignoring
the
threat
posed
to
its
growth
by
renewables
just
as
coal
once
ignored
the
threat
posed
by
natural
gas
renewables
and
environmental
activists
one
of
the
common
notions
in
the
natural
gas
industry
is
that
the
fuel
is
a
great
fit
with
the
more
intermittent
renewables
such
as
wind
and
solar
but
there
seems
to
be
little
effort
on
the
industry
s
part
to
seriously
partner
with
the
renewables
sector
to
ensure
that
together
they
dominate
the
future
of
electricity
generation
the
main
risk
from
the
iea
report
is
that
all
energy
players
see
in
it
what
they
want
to
see
rather
than
viewing
it
as
only
one
possible
future

of
many
the
opinions
expressed
