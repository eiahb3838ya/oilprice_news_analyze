abu
dhabi
reuters
when
president
donald
trump
asked
saudi
arabia
this
summer
to
raise
oil
production
to
compensate
for
lower
crude
exports
from
iran
riyadh
swiftly
told
washington
it
would
do
so
but
saudi
arabia
did
not
receive
advance
warning
when
trump
made
a
by
offering
generous
waivers
that
are
keeping
more
iranian
crude
in
the
market
instead
of
driving
exports
from
riyadh
s
down
to
zero
opec
and
industry
sources
by
the
move
that
has
raised
worries
about
over
supply
saudi
arabia
is
now
considering
cutting
output
with
opec
and
its
allies
by
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
or
percent
of
global
supply
sources
told
reuters
this
week
the
saudis
are
very
angry
at
trump
they
don
t
trust
him
any
more
and
feel
very
strongly
about
a
cut
they
had
no
about
the
waivers
said
one
senior
source
briefed
on
saudi
energy
policies
washington
has
said
the
waivers
are
a
temporary
concession
to
allies
that
imported
iranian
crude
and
might
have
struggled
to
find
other
supplies
quickly
when
sanctions
were
imposed
on
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
on
that
cutting
iranian
exports
to
zero
immediately
would
have
shocked
the
market
i
don
t
want
to
lift
oil
prices
he
said
a
source
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
the
saudis
were
going
to
be
angry
either
way
with
the
waivers
or
even
after
the
a
state
department
official
said
we
don
t
discuss
diplomatic
the
shift
toward
offering
waivers
adds
to
tension
between
the
united
states
and
saudi
arabia
as
washington
pushes
for
riyadh
to
shed
full
light
on
the
murder
of
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
in
the
saudi
consulate
in
turkey
the
saudis
feel
they
were
completely
snookered
by
trump
they
did
everything
to
raise
supplies
assuming
washington
would
push
for
very
harsh
iranian
sanctions
and
they
didn
t
get
any
heads
up
from
the
that
iran
will
get
softer
sanctions
said
a
second
source
briefed
on
saudi
oil
thinking
saudi
energy
ministry
did
not
respond
to
a
reuters
request
for
comment
since
the
summer
riyadh
has
led
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
russia
and
other
producers
to
hike
supplies
by
over
million
bpd
to
keep
a
lid
on
prices
as
sanctions
were
imposed
brent
oil
had
surged
above
a
barrel
in
october
on
tight
supply
worries
but
prices
have
since
slid
to
on
concerns
about
oversupply
trump
had
wanted
lower
oil
prices
before
the
midterm
elections
earlier
this
month
washington
gave
waivers
in
november
to
eight
buyers
to
purchase
iranian
oil
for
days
this
was
more
waivers
than
were
initially
expected
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
a
key
trump
administration
ally
wants
prices
at
or
more
for
his
economic
reforms
sources
familiar
with
saudi
thinking
say
the
waivers
were
totally
unexpected
especially
after
calls
to
raise
output
a
few
people
are
upset
said
a
senior
gulf
oil
source
familiar
with
the
discussions
among
opec
and
its
allies
on
output
policy
while
the
united
states
set
a
time
limit
for
the
waivers
it
did
not
tell
the
eight
recipients
how
much
oil
they
could
buy
and
has
not
eased
payment
restrictions
complicating
purchases
iran
s
oil
exports
are
expected
to
drop
sharply
to
about
million
bpd
in
november
from
a
peak
of
million
bpd
earlier
this
year
although
output
is
expected
to
recover
from
december
thanks
to
waivers
it
is
still
not
clear
by
how
much
riyadh
s
concern
is
to
avoid
the
kind
of
oversupply
in
the
market
that
led
to
a
price
collapse
in
to
below
but
the
lack
of
clarity
about
the
level
of
iran
s
supplies
makes
it
tough
for
saudi
arabia
to
work
out
appropriate
production
levels
especially
after
russia
raised
output
steeply
in
recent
months
and
has
said
it
wanted
to
produce
more
in
saudi
arabia
would
need
to
convince
russia
to
join
in
any
move
for
new
supply
cuts
first
the
saudis
let
oil
prices
rise
to
per
barrel
and
then
flooded
the
market
can
they
now
cut
back
enough
going
into
a
seasonally
weak
time
of
the
year
without
russia
it
won
t
be
credible
said
gary
ross
ceo
of
black
gold
investors
saudi
arabia
must
also
contend
with
rising
production
that
has
hit
record
levels
above
million
bpd
and
is
set
to
climb
further
next
year
exports
could
surge
from
the
second
part
of
when
new
pipeline
infrastructure
opens
rapidan
energy
group
said
it
saw
a
supply
glut
now
lasting
much
more
than
just
a
few
months
in
now
that
the
market
has
correctly
priced
iran
sanctions
and
much
bigger
inventory
builds
next
year
we
wish
to
emphasize
that
opec
plus
officials
face
more
than
a
supply
tsunami
in
rapidan
