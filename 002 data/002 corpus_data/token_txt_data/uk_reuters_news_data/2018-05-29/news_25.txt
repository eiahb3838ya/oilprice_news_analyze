finance
and
trade
sources
say
iran
faces
increasing
difficulties
accessing
capital
transactions
had
already
been
constrained
as
many
large
foreign
banks
remained
wary
of
trade
even
under
the
nuclear
deal
the
exodus
by
the
limited
number
of
foreign
banks
willing
to
process
transactions
with
iran
is
a
big
blow
especially
on
the
trade
finance
side
one
finance
source
said
the
nuclear
agreement
worked
out
by
the
united
states
five
other
world
powers
and
iran
lifted
sanctions
on
tehran
in
exchange
for
limits
to
its
nuclear
programme
tehran
is
pressuring
europe
to
come
up
with
a
package
of
economic
measures
by
may
after
major
powers
agreed
on
friday
to
move
quickly
to
offset
washington
s
withdrawal
from
the
deal
those
measures
include
banning
firms
from
complying
with
the
reimposed
sanctions
urging
governments
to
make
transfers
to
iran
s
central
bank
to
avoid
fines
and
creating
alternative
financing
channels
but
analysts
say
there
are
big
challenges
to
keeping
the
nuclear
deal
alive
the
sanctions
will
make
iran
s
business
environment
more
difficult
to
operate
in
bmi
research
said
in
a
note
last
week
firms
that
have
exposure
to
the
market
are
therefore
unlikely
to
want
to
maintain
or
expand
their
iranian
presence
for
fear
of
sanction
related
penalties

backlash
