petroleo
brasileiro
sa
and
brazil
s
government
are
very
close
to
resolving
a
dispute
over
an
offshore
area
a
deputy
minister
said
dismissing
concerns
a
fuel
pricing
crisis
had
emerged
as
an
obstacle
in
talks
on
sunday
brazilian
president
michel
temer
offered
new
fuel
subsidies
to
soften
the
blow
from
a
in
diesel
prices
that
has
sparked
a
nationwide
truckers
protest
paralyzing
the
country
s
economy
his
government
also
promised
to
compensate
petrobras
for
losses
it
may
incur
by
abandoning
a
pricing
policy
the
offers
of
the
subsidies
fanned
fears
among
investors
that
the
turmoil
could
delay
petrobras
bid
to
conclude
a
longstanding
compensation
dispute
with
the
government
over
the
area
dimming
hopes
for
a
windfall
for
the
world
s
most
indebted
oil
company
despite
overlapping
with
the
truckers
strike
talks
were
not
suspended
deputy
mining
and
energy
minister
marcio
felix
told
reuters
late
on
monday
there
are
just
a
few
sticking
points
they
are
very
earlier
this
month
a
brazilian
paper
reported
that
petrobras
was
likely
to
get
the
rights
to
produce
an
additional
billion
to
billion
barrels
of
oil
to
settle
the
dispute
resolving
the
dispute
would
let
the
government
which
is
expected
to
be
ousted
in
elections
in
october
raise
extra
revenue
to
close
a
huge
budget
gap
by
auctioning
off
the
rights
to
billions
of
barrels
of
oil
following
a
resolution
of
the
dispute
felix
said
such
an
auction
could
still
be
possible
in
november
before
the
current
government
turns
over
power
to
a
new
president
in
january
he
emphasized
that
the
goal
was
shared
by
petrobras
ceo
pedro
parente
who
has
been
rumored
to
be
considering
resigning
from
the
company
he
is
credited
with
turning
around
after
a
massive
corruption
scandal
and
years
of
mismanagement
rights
would
be
a
crowning
achievement
for
him
after
two
years
in
management
felix
said
adding
that
it
would
not
be
good
for
him
to
leave
the
dispute
has
its
roots
in
a
deal
under
which
brazil
s
government
granted
petrobras
rights
to
extract
billion
barrels
of
oil
and
gas
from
under
a
thick
layer
of
salt
beneath
the
ocean
floor
for
a
price
based
on
oil
prices
then
however
the
contract
stipulated
that
costs
among
other
things
would
be
reviewed
after
the
area
was
declared
commercially
viable
in
that
has
led
to
years
of
sparring
as
oil
prices
have
fluctuated
oil
executives
say
a
bid
round
for
the
remaining
areas
would
draw
enormous
bids
thanks
to
top
notch
geology
and
lack
of
risk
