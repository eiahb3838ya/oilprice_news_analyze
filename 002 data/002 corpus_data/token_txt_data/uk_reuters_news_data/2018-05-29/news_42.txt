how the world's biggest private equity oil and gas industry bid collapsed
melbourne
reuters
blame
it
on
trump
iran
or
venezuela
rising
oil
prices
combined
with
a
heavy
debt
load
killed
the
world
s
biggest
private
equity
oil
and
gas
industry
deal
last
week
harbour
energy
left
australia
after
a
year
of
chasing
gas
producer
santos
ltd
missing
out
on
santos
stakes
in
three
liquefied
natural
gas
projects
in
australia
and
papua
new
guinea
as
it
sought
to
become
a
major
lng
player
the
firm
backed
by
eig
global
energy
partners
was
forced
to
bid
against
itself
five
times
including
twice
over
one
weekend
until
it
made
a
final
offer
of
billion
up
more
than
percent
from
its
first
approach
last
august
the
grievance
runs
deep
and
it
s
heartfelt
said
a
person
in
the
harbour
camp
harbour
chief
executive
linda
cook
a
former
senior
executive
at
royal
dutch
shell
was
on
a
plane
last
tuesday
when
she
heard
santos
had
rejected
its
sixth
offer
worth
about
a
a
share
she
declined
to
comment
for
this
story
harbour
s
disappointed
chairman
blair
thomas
was
already
back
in
washington
dc
and
didn
t
mince
words
there
was
insufficient
engagement
with
santos
on
valuation
no
meaningful
attempt
by
santos
to
discuss
a
realistic
price
which
could
supported
by
any
reasonable
set
of
technical
and
commercial
assumptions
and
an
unwillingness
by
their
board
to
explore
means
of
closing
the
gap
between
the
offer
and
their
expectations
he
said
in
a
statement
thomas
believed
by
the
end
of
a
weekend
of
back
and
forth
between
advisers
on
both
sides
that
he
had
a
deal
with
santos
chairman
keith
spence
a
person
in
the
harbour
camp
said
harbour
s
team
were
parked
in
sydney
where
harbour
s
backer
eig
has
an
office
and
advisers
at
jpmorgan
morgan
stanley
and
highbury
are
based
according
to
people
involved
a
couple
of
hundred
people
were
involved
in
analysing
data
and
conducting
due
diligence
they
said
cook
and
thomas
met
kevin
gallagher
and
keith
spence
their
counterparts
at
santos
on
may
they
felt
encouraged
the
board
would
facilitate
an
offer
going
to
shareholders
people
in
the
harbour
camp
said
people
on
both
sides
said
talks
were
cordial
the
whole
time
but
the
santos
board
was
firm
on
value
and
harbour
failed
to
offer
enough
of
a
premium
as
oil
prices
marched
higher
crude
prices
climbed
from
around
a
barrel
when
harbour
made
its
first
approach
in
august
to
last
week
their
highest
since
late
as
president
donald
trump
imposed
sanctions
on
venezuela
and
pulled
out
of
a
nuclear
arms
control
deal
with
iran
both
key
oil
producers
what
hurt
harbour
was
the
billion
in
debt
they
had
lined
up
from
jpmorgan
and
morgan
stanley
which
required
oil
price
hedging
against
percent
of
santos
lng
sales
making
the
deal
complex
santos
investors
and
bankers
said
the
problem
is
when
you
get
deals
there
are
a
lot
of
terms
and
conditions
you
have
to
meet
and
it
makes
it
inflexible
said
a
veteran
australian
investment
banker
not
involved
in
the
bid
santos
balked
when
harbour
tried
to
force
the
company
to
lock
in
the
hedges
in
order
to
cut
costs
for
the
banks
and
allow
harbour
to
raise
its
offer
santos
said
it
was
resilient
to
the
oil
price
fall
as
it
has
slashed
costs
to
be
cash
flow
breakeven
at
a
barrel
the
value
of
the
harbour
bid
was
simply
not
compelling
enough
compared
with
santos
own
growth
plan
the
risks
associated
with
the
hedging
and
the
reliance
on
santos
balance
sheet
to
help
fund
the
deal
a
santos
spokeswoman
said
not
only
was
harbour
jilted
at
the
altar
but
the
biggest
shareholders
in
santos
chinese
gas
distributor
enn
ecological
and
private
equity
firm
hony
capital
missed
out
on
more
than
doubling
their
combined
stake
to
up
to
percent
in
a
privatised
santos
sources
said
enn
and
hony
were
as
furious
as
harbour
they
re
deeply
disappointed
and
angry
and
frustrated
a
person
close
to
enn
said
they
feel
that
the
outcome
didn
t
reflect
some
of
the
conversations
with
senior
santos
however
in
a
statement
to
the
shanghai
stock
exchange
last
week
enn
which
has
a
director
on
the
board
of
santos
said
the
company
s
future
cooperation
with
santos
is
not
a
santos
spokeswoman
said
enn
is
part
of
a
united
santos
board
and
the
company
s
strategic
relationship
with
enn
and
hony
remains
in
place
hony
said
it
will
closely
follow
the
further
development
swiss
energy
and
commodities
trader
mercuria
which
was
set
to
contribute
percent
of
the
bid
was
thwarted
in
its
ambition
to
use
santos
to
get
into
lng
trading
where
its
rivals
glencore
gunvor
trafigura
and
vitol
are
already
active
a
lot
of
time
and
money
went
into
this
so
it
is
annoying
said
a
person
familiar
with
mercuria
s
thinking
mecuria
declined
to
comment
harbour
s
first
approach
last
august
was
swiftly
rejected
by
the
board
under
peter
coates
who
had
also
rebuffed
a
billion
takeover
offer
two
years
earlier
when
santos
was
wallowing
in
debt
as
oil
prices
collapsed
the
august
approach
was
only
disclosed
by
santos
in
november
after
a
newspaper
outed
harbour
it
took
harbour
until
march
to
line
up
funding
from
jpmorgan
and
morgan
stanley
and
equity
from
mercuria
enn
and
hony
in
order
to
make
another
approach
top
shareholder
argo
investments
said
the
deal
was
too
complex
and
would
have
involved
santos
taking
on
too
much
risk
when
there
was
a
lot
of
uncertainty
around
whether
it
would
be
approved
shareholders
have
faith
in
ceo
gallagher
who
slashed
costs
and
cut
debt
faster
than
expected
over
the
past
two
years
it
s
fair
to
say
that
he
s
done
a
pretty
good
job
said
argo
investments
managing
director
jason
beddow
the
proof
will
be
in
the
pudding
as
to
how
santos
looks
in
a
year
or
two
s
time
which
is
somewhat
dependent
on
the
