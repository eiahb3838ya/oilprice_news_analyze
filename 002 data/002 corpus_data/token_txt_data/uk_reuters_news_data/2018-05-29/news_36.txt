lebanon
s
search
for

by
a
consortium
of
france

total
italy
s
eni
and
russia
s
novatek
energy
and

minister
cesar
abi
khalil
also
said
in
a
televised

that
lebanon
hoped
to
launch

lebanon
signed
its
first
offshore
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
production
agreements
with
the
consortium
for
offshore
blocks
and
part
of
block
contains
waters
disputed
with
neighbouring
israel
but
the
consortium
has
said
it
has
no
plans
to
drill
in
the
disputed
area
khalil
said
authorities
gave
the
go
ahead
on
monday
for
exploration
of
the
two
blocks
to
begin
the
exploration
period
can
last
up
to
three
years
and
the
first
well
is
expected
to
be
drilled
in
providing
all
government
departments
grant
necessary
licences
and
permissions
on
time
and
without
delay
the
minister
said
khalil
has
served
as
energy
minister
since
december
but
is
now
a
caretaker
minister
because
prime
saad
has
not
yet
formed
a
government
after
parliamentary
elections
on
may
the
minister
said
drilling
would
determine
whether
lebanon
had
commercial
reserves
and
their
scale
lebanon
is
on
the
levant
basin
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
where
a
number
of
big
gas
fields
have
been
discovered
since
in
cypriot
israeli
and
egyptian
waters
khalil
did
not
say
how
many
or
which
of
the
country
s
offshore
blocks
would
be
included
in
a
second
licensing
round
khalil
who
in
april
asked
the
lebanese
petroleum
administration
lpa
to
prepare
for
a
second
licensing
round
said
authorities
were
considering
modifying
existing
qualification
criteria
for
firms
interested
in
the
next
round
lebanon
tried
to
launch
its
first
offshore
exploration
in
but
domestic
political
problems
delayed
it
until
khalil
previously
said
the
delay
during
which
time
global
energy
prices
plummeted
undermined
interest
in
the
first
licensing
round
in
the
end
was
the
only
consortium
to
submit
an
offer
out
of
companies
which
had
qualified
since
to
bid
he
said
on
tuesday
he
hoped
market
conditions
in
would
be
better
and
that
companies
positive
experience
with
the
first
round
would
lead
to
wider
participation
in
a
second
