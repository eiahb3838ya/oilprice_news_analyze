canada
s
biggest
public
pension
funds
could
be
buyers
of
kinder
morgan
canada
ltd
s
trans
mountain
pipeline
but
are
unlikely
to
invest
until
the
c
billion
billion
project
has
been
built
several
pension
fund
sources
said
on
tuesday
the
canadian
government
said
on
tuesday
it
will
buy
the
trans
mountain
assets
for
c
billion
hoping
to
salvage
a
project
that
faces
formidable
political
and
environmental
opposition
the
pipeline
is
intended
to
move
canadian
crude
to
ports
in
the
vancouver
area
for
shipment
to
foreign
markets
although
the
federal
government
has
taken
stakes
in
other
struggling
energy
projects
tuesday
s
announcement
marked
the
first
time
it
is
being
an
entire
pipeline
and
ottawa
said
it
does
not
want
to
hold
the
asset
for
the
long
term
frank
mckenna
bank
s
deputy
chairman
and
a
former
new
brunswick
premier
said
he
expected
pension
funds
and
private
equity
players
to
be
interested
in
the
asset
as
well
as
other
pipeline
or
infrastructure
players
i
think
there
will
be
a
lot
of
private
sector
interest
in
this
project
once
the
political
risk
is
taken
out
of
it
these
are
very
desirable
assets
they
pay
good
economic
rents
and
they
re
assets

investment
board
canada
s
biggest
public
pension
plan
said
on
tuesday
it
was
not
actively
assessing
an
investment
in
the
extension
the
canadian
government
could
bring
in
partners
to
help
finance
the
expansion
according
to
pension
fund
sources
however
it
is
unlikely
to
do
so
through
its
infrastructure
bank
set
up
last
year
to
facilitate
partnerships
but
not
yet
operational
they
said
canadian
pension
funds
have
a
preference
for
buying
assets
that
are
already
built
rather
than
those
with
construction
risks
and
the
reputational
risk
associated
with
the
project
could
also
be
a
turnoff
with
that
in
mind
pension
fund
sources
said
the
federal
government
may
have
to
hold
the
asset
for
a
number
of
years
to
eventually
attract
the
best
price
and
give
it
the
best
chance
to
recover
money
for
taxpayers
or
even
make
a
profit
