a
worsening
political
crisis
in
italy
provoked
a
second
day
of
selling
on
european
markets
with
the
euro
cut
to
an
low
stocks
punished
and
borrowing
costs
surging
for
the
government
in
rome
investors
fear
that
repeat
elections
which
now
seem
inevitable
in
the
euro
zone
s
economy
may
become
a
de
facto
referendum
on
italian
membership
of
the
currency
bloc
and
the
country
s
role
in
the
european
union
italian
bond
yields
a
sensitive
gauge
of
political
risk
soared
as
much
as
basis
points
to
their
highest
since
late
in
their
biggest
move
in
years
the
euro
dropped
towards
for
the
first
time
in
close
to
a
year
down
percent
on
the
day
against
the
swiss
franc
it
fell
to
francs
stocks
in
milan
slid
percent
on
the
main
index
after
a
percent
fall
on
monday
bank
shares
slumped
another
percent
after
losing
percent
in
the
previous
session
bruised
by
the
in
government
bonds
a
core
part
of
bank
portfolios
it
is
just
a
slide
and
as
the
slide
continues
you
ask
where
is
the
end
said
saxo
bank
s
head
of
fx
strategy
john
hardy
global
contagion
is
a
risk
he
said
with
the
benchmark
s
p
stocks
index
also
close
to
breaching
some
key
support
levels
hardy
recalled
a
promise
made
in
by
european
central
bank
president
mario
draghi
to
keep
the
euro
intact
if
this
continues
for
another
couple
of
sessions
i
think
you
will
have
to
see
some
official
european
response
a
whatever
it
takes
kind
of
moment
he
said
adding
to
the
uncertainty
spanish
prime
minister
mariano
rajoy
will
face
a
vote
of
confidence
in
his
leadership
on
friday
spain
s
spread
with
germany
also
went
to
its
widest
in
months
at
bps
madrid
s
ibex
bourse
was
down
almost
percent
asia
flinched
too
japan
s
nikkei
slipped
percent
and
chinese
and
hong
kong
shares
ended
to
percent
in
the
red
markets
pointed
to
losses
later
with
the
s
futures
for
the
down
percent
the
dollar
was
up
against
almost
all
major
currencies
except
the
japanese
yen
the
currency
is
heading
for
its
best
month
in
a
year
and
a
half
a
move
that
is
hurting
many
emerging
market
countries
that
borrow
in
dollars
em
stocks
hit
a
low
while
south
africa
s
rand
led
the
currency
retreat
as
it
dropped
percent
the
biggest
contributor
is
fear
of
a
euro
zone
crisis
and
the
spillover
from
that
into
demand
for
currencies
said
koon
chow
an
fx
strategist
at
ubp
away
from
europe
the
focus
was
on
the

and
the
white
house
said
a
team
was
travelling
to
the
city
to
meet
the
north
koreans
the
reports
indicate
that
planning
for
the
summit
initially
scheduled
for
june
is
moving
ahead
even
though
president
donald
trump
called
it
off
last
week
a
day
later
trump
said
he
had
reconsidered
and
officials
from
both
countries
were
meeting
to
work
out
details
in
another
sign
that
investors
were
flocking
to
safer
bets
though
the
euro
hit
a
low
versus
the
yen
with
a
percent
drop
to
yen
its
biggest
slide
in
four
months
elsewhere
in

the
