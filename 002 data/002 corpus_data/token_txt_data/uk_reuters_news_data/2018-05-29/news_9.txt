investors
fear
that

soon
as

what

global
economic
recovery

now
a
waning

italy
seems
likely

prime
carlo

failed
to
secure
any
support
from
major
political
parties
for
even
a

sources
told
reuters
on
tuesday
italy
has
searched
for
a
new
government
since
inconclusive
elections
in
march
and
investors
fear
voters
will
choose
a
party
hoping
to
break
with
the
continent
s
austere
fiscal
policy
approach
and
even
the
multinational
