the

amid

tariffs
on

from
another

a
source
at
a
trading
house
said
on

the
producers
claimed
firmer
spot
premiums
and
tighter
supplies
due
to
sanction
on
rusal
as
the
reasons

spot
premiums
in
the
united
states
have
more
than
doubled
so
far
this
year
underpinned
by
a
percent
tariff
on
aluminium
imports
to
counter
what
president
donald
trump
has
described
as
unfair
international
competition
the
united

move
in
april
to
impose
sanctions
on
rusal
preventing
customers
with
exposure
from
continuing
to
buy
metal
from
the
company
fanned
further
supply
worries
and
drove
up
benchmark
london
prices
to
their
highest
in
almost
seven
years
but
rusal
resumed
shipping
aluminium
to
some
customers
earlier
this
month
following
an
extension
of
the
deadline
for
companies
to
wind
down
contracts
under
the
sanctions

last
week

about

said
they
expect
more
difficult
negotiations
than
usual
between
japanese
buyers
and
producers
the
latest
quarterly
pricing
negotiations
began
this
week
between
japanese
buyers
and

including

corp
and
are
expected
to
continue
