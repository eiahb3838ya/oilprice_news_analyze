update 2-sandridge fights back against icahn over board control
reuters
sandridge
energy
inc
warned
shareholders
on
tuesday
they
would
be
handing
control
of
the
company
too
cheaply
to
activist
investor
carl
icahn
if
they
elect
his
new
nominees
to
the
board
at
an
annual
meeting
next
month
icahn
earlier
in
may
added
two
more
nominees
to
his
slate
demanding
yet
more
influence
after
the
company
expanded
its
board
to
seven
directors
from
five
to
accommodate
the
activist
investor
s
demands
in
a
letter
to
shareholders
sandridge
chief
executive
officer
william
griffin
said
the
billionaire
investor
who
has
said
he
could
make
an
offer
for
the
company
was
not
competing
fairly
with
other
potential
counterparties
an
board
would
likely
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
participation
of
potential
counterparties
because
such
a
process
would
be
rigged
in
favor
of
icahn
griffin
said
icahn
has
made
a
career
out
of
shaking
up
company
management
and
as
the
biggest
shareholder
in
sandridge
with
a
percent
stake
he
has
already
forced
the
resignation
of
both
its
chief
executive
and
chief
financial
officers
sandridge
s
shares
however
have
fallen
more
than
percent
since
icahn
disclosed
his
stake
on
and
the
jury
is
still
out
on
how
new
management
or
sales
of
company
assets
would
deliver
more
value
to
shareholders
a
slump
in
oil
prices
and
its
exposure
to
costly
production
in
the
mississippi
lime
forced
the
oklahoma
oil
producer
briefly
into
bankruptcy
proceedings
in
oil
prices
have
since
recovered
to
a
barrel
for
the
first
time
since
and
shale
producers
in
the
united
states
have
benefited
from
cheaper
drilling
methods
and
ever
increasing
global
demand
the
question
is
whether
sandridge
now
has
a
better
spread
of
drilling
sites
to
take
advantage
of
the
rise
david
beard
analyst
at
coker
palmer
institutional
said
while
investors
often
penalize
the
valuations
of
companies
with
current
declining
production
icahn
is
betting
on
sandridge
s
undrilled
locations
in
the
hope
that
those
will
bring
the
production
levels
up
sd
operates
in
a
relatively
higher
cost
mississippi
lime
basin
thus
the
downturn
hurt
them
particularly
hard
having
to
drop
almost
all
their
rigs
this
placed
downward
pressure
on
production
beard
said
but
should
production
grow
and
undrilled
locations
become
valuable
we
can
see
net
asset
values
approach
icahn
initially
persuaded
sandridge
s
leadership
to
back
out
of
a
million
deal
with
rival
bonanza
creek
energy
inc
but
he
has
now
spent
months
laying
into
its
management
in
april
the
billionaire
nominated
jonathan
frates
and
nicholas
graziano
both
of
whom
work
for
icahn
companies
to
sandridge
s
board
the
other
three
nominees
are
john
lipinski
and
bob
alexander
who
have
worked
with
refining
company
cvr
energy
inc
and
randolph
read
who
has
worked
with
investment
fund
nevada
strategic
credit
investment
ahead
of
the
june
shareholders
meeting
griffin
said
icahn
s
continuous
additions
to
the
board
would
end
the
impartial
process
drive
away
competition
and
position
icahn
to
consolidate
control
as
cheaply
as
possible
icahn
s
involvement
and
pressuring
of
newell
brands
inc
to
appoint
four
of
his
nominees
to
its
board
ran
parallel
to
the
company
s
shares
recovering
some
of
last
year
s
almost
percent
loss
they
have
since
retreated
to
back
to
near
record
lows
icahn
s
move
with
fellow
shareholder
darwin
deason
to
prevent
xerox
corp
merging
with
fujifilm
holdings
have
seen
shares
in
the
photocopying
icon
fall
around
percent
from
a
high
hit
when
the
deal
was
announced
in
january
icahn
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
