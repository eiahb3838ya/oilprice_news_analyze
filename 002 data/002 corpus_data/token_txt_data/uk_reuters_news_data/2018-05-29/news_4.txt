analysis-pipeline move a risk for canada's trudeau, but inaction worse
ottawa

canada
s
decision
on
tuesday
to
buy
a
troubled
oil
pipeline
is
a
big
risk
that
could
cost
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
important
voter
support
in
a
major
province
but
insiders
say
failure
to
act
decisively
to
boost
energy
exports
might
hurt
his
chances
to
win
in
trudeau
s
liberal
government
said
it
will
buy
kinder
morgan
canada
ltd
s
trans
mountain
pipeline
for
c
billion
billion
in
hopes
of
saving
a
project
that
faces
major
political
and
environmental
opposition
i
think
this
could
end
up
being
the
biggest
gamble
of
his
mandate
said
pollster
nik
nanos
noting
trudeau
came
to
power
in
late
promising
to
do
more
for
the
environment
this
is
a
very
risky
political
move
in
terms
of
the
prime
minister
s
personal
brand
and
the
brand
of
the
liberal
party
but
weighed
against
the
needs
of
the
economy
the
liberals
probably
see
this
as
a
necessary
liberal
insiders
hope
the
move
will
help
dispel
criticism
that
trudeau
dithers
on
big
issues
ditching
some
campaign
promises
and
consulting
endlessly
on
others
with
little
actual
achievement
after
three
years
in
office
party
operatives
dispute
that
trudeau
has
frittered
away
his
time
in
power
but
they
concede
the
accusations
of
inaction
are
taking
a
toll
the
main
opposition
conservative
party
is
becoming
more
competitive
in
polls
and
even
took
the
lead
in
one
nanos
research
survey
released
on
tuesday
which
showed
conservatives
at
percent
public
support
and
the
liberals
at
percent
it
is
better
in
this
case
to
take
action
even
if
it
turns
out
to
be
the
wrong
choice
than
do
nothing
said
a
liberal
source
who
requested
anonymity
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
situation
trans
mountain
runs
from
the
alberta
oil
sands
to
the
pacific
province
of
british
columbia
and
a
planned
expansion
is
a
centrepiece
of
trudeau
s
energy
policy
and
key
to
helping
meet
carbon
emission
agreements
opposition
is
fierce
in
british
columbia
where
the
liberals
won
an
unexpectedly
large
number
of
seats
in
yet
trudeau
says
the
expansion
must
go
ahead
so
exporters
can
ship
oil
to
global
markets
senior
liberals
play
down
the
chances
of
a
political
massacre
in
the
election
noting
recent
polls
show
a
slim
majority
of
people
in
british
columbia
back
the
pipeline
the
pipeline
s
biggest
supporters
are
in
western
provinces
like
alberta
where
liberals
traditionally
do
poorly
the
government
has
staked
so
much
on
this
that
if
they
don
t
come
out
with
a
deal
of
some
sort
that
will
be
highly
problematic
for
them
politically
said
monica
gattinger
director
of
the
institute
for
science
society
and
policy
at
the
university
of
ottawa
the
liberals
who
promise
to
balance
the
needs
of
the
natural
resources
industry
with
the
environment
blocked
one
proposed
pipeline
to
the
pacific
coast
in
the
proponents
behind
a
similar
line
to
the
atlantic
pulled
out
in
after
the
national
energy
regulator
imposed
more
conditions
