president
donald
trump
is
giving
japanese
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
a
decidedly
tough
time
on
trade
trump
has
also
withdrawn
from
a
multilateral
partnership
tpp
promoted
by
abe
as
a
counterweight
to
china
abandoned
a
climate
change
accord
backed
by
tokyo
and
is
pursuing
talks
with
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
notwithstanding
abe
s
warnings
about
past
mistakes
since
trump
was
elected
the
two
leaders
have
met
nine
times
shared
burgers
played
golf
three
times
and
spoken
nearly
times
by
phone
in
their
latest
telephone
chat
overnight
abe
and
trump
agreed
to
meet
again
before
a
korea
summit
that
could
take
place
next
month
i
think
he
has
penetrated
trump
s
mind
to
a
certain
degree
but
that
is
different
from
his
pet
agenda
on
trade
said
keio
university
professor
toshihiro
nakayama
prime
minister
abe
and
his
team
expected
a
bit
more
because
of
the
personal
chemistry
that
was
a
bit
of
wishful
thinking
look
at
macron
nakayama
added
like
abe
french
president
emmanuel
macron
has
developed
a
strong
personal
relationship
with
trump
yet
has
clashed
with
him
over
issues
including
iran
climate
change
and
trade
trump
s
administration
decided
last
week
to
begin
a
national
security
investigation
into
auto
imports
that
could
lead
to
new
tariffs
similar
to
those
already
imposed
on
imported
steel
and
aluminum
motor
vehicles
make
up
about
percent
of
japanese
exports
to
the
united
states
the
auto
probe
follows
an
april
agreement
by
trump
and
abe
to
set
up
a
new
framework
to
discuss
free
fair
and
reciprocal
trade
that
will
be
led
by
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
and
japanese
economy
minister
toshimitsu
motegi
trump
has
made
clear
he
prefers
a
bilateral
deal
to
cut
a
trade
deficit
with
japan
that
hit
billion
yen
billion
last
month
however
abe
s
administration
insists
multilateral
pacts
are
still
the
best
bet
ffr
is
not
a
negotiation
or
scoping
exercise
for
a
bilateral
fta
free
trade
agreement
a
japanese
official
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
told
reuters
we
see
it
in
a
broader
behind
japan
s
resistance
to
a
bilateral
fta
is
in
part
the
fear
of
pressure
to
open
up
its
agriculture
sector
the
farm
lobby
is
an
important
base
for
abe
s
ruling
party
for
now
japan
is
working
from
a
familiar
playbook
with
a
strategy
combining
highlighting
past
and
planned
purchases
of
goods
and
investments
possible
moves
sanctioned
by
the
world
trade
organization
wto
and
expanding
a
web
of
trade
pacts
that
tokyo
hopes
will
eventually
lure
washington
back
to
the
multilateral
order
japan
has
notified
the
wto
it
reserves
the
right
to
take
against
the
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminum
totaling
million
the
amount
of
added
duties
the
tariffs
would
impose
on
its
exports
of
those
products
we
have
the
right
but
not
the
obligation
to
do
it
the
japanese
official
said
adding
any
steps
against
future
tariffs
on
japanese
car
exports
would
also
be
as
they
ve
done
since
trump
was
elected
japanese
officials
are
highlighting
how
much
japanese
carmakers
and
other
firms
contribute
to
the
economy
as
of
japan
says
its
companies
have
invested
a
cumulative
billion
in
the
united
state
creating
more
than
jobs
a
rise
in
energy
imports
is
also
expected
to
help
trim
the
bilateral
trade
imbalance
japan
received
its
first
shipment
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
last
week
from
dominion
energy
inc
s
newly
completed
cove
point
maryland
export
plant
the
beginning
of
a
jump
in
imports
from
the
united
states
the
balance
will
tilt
toward
the
united
states
whether
it
is
big
enough
is
open
to
question
but
at
least
things
will
be
happening
in
the
eyes
of
the
president
the
japanese
official
said
japanese
officials
deny
they
are
on
trade
negotiations
but
some
experts
said
playing
for
time
could
be
useful
it
s
not
japan
that
needs
a
bilateral
fta
it
s
the
united
states
said
former
japanese
trade
negotiator
yorizumi
watanabe
japan
can
take
the
approach
of
that
tactic
however
risks
backfiring
the
president
is
as
you
know
a
man
of
action
and
expects
us
to
get
results
quickly
