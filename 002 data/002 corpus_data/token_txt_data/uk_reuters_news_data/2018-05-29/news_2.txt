reuters
canada
will
buy
kinder

ltd
s
trans
mountain
pipeline
for
c
billion
billion
the
government
said
on
tuesday
hoping
to
save
a
project
that
faces
formidable
political
and
environmental
opposition
finance
minister
bill
morneau
said
purchasing
the
pipeline
was
the
only
way
to
ensure
that
a
planned
expansion
could
proceed
the
pipeline
running
from
the
oil
sands
of
alberta
to
a
port
in
the
pacific
province
of
british
columbia
would
allow
canadian
crude
to
gain
greater
access
to
foreign
markets
and
higher
prices
kinder
morgan
canada
gave
ottawa
until
may
to
come
up
with
reassurances
it
could
press
ahead
with
plans
to
more
than
double
the
capacity
of
the
existing
pipeline
amid
efforts
by
british
columbia
to
block
construction
the
company
also
faced
opposition
from
environmentalists
and
aboriginal
groups
who
worried
about
the
pipeline
spilling
its
heavy
oil
when
we
are
faced
with
an
exceptional
situation
that
puts
jobs
at
risk
that
puts
our
international
reputation
on
the
line
our
government
is
prepared
to
take
action
morneau
told
reporters
he
said
the
pipeline
purchase
provided
the
federal
jurisdiction
needed
to
overcome
british
columbia
s
opposition
but
gave
no
details
of
how
this
would
work
the
federal
government
can
in
theory
step
in
and
disallow
any
provincial
laws
that
british
columbia
might
use
to
block
the
pipeline
but
this
provision
in
the
canadian
constitution
has
not
been
used
since
the
ottawa
could
also
deploy
the
police
and
troops
to
maintain
a
barrier
between
protesters
and
construction
workers
although
ottawa
has
taken
stakes
in
struggling
energy
projects
tuesday
s
announcement
marked
the
first
time
ottawa
has
bought
an
entire
pipeline
it
does
not
intend
to
own
the
project
for
long
there
is
a
very
strong
business
case
for
this
pipeline
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
told
bloomberg
television
saying
the
government
takeover
meant
a
lot
of
the
legal
barriers
and
a
lot
of
the
challenge
points
actually
disappear
kinder
morgan
canada
shares
initially
jumped
as
much
as
percent
before
ending
down
percent
while
the
broader
canada
share
index
fell
percent
the
move
drew
immediate
criticism
from
both
sides
of
the
political
spectrum
and
could
hurt
trudeau
s
popularity
in
the
key
british
columbia
battleground
in
a
federal
election
the
decision
represents
a
massive
unnecessary
financial
burden
on
canadian
taxpayers
canadian
taxpayers
federation
federal
director
aaron
wudrick
said
the
government
will
also
offer
federal
loan
guarantees
to
ensure
construction
of
the
expansion
continues
through
the
season
as
part
of
the
deal
with
the
company
a
unit
of
kinder
morgan
inc
morneau
sidestepped
questions
about
how
ottawa
will
deal
with
opposition
from
environmentalists
and
aboriginal
groups
who
cite
the
risk
of
a
catastrophic
spill
it
s
a
mess
out
there
said
a
calgary
industry
source
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
given
it
will
be
stuck
in
court
for
a
while
i
don
t
think
we
will
see
this
pipe
built
anytime
morneau
said
more
spending
would
be
needed
to
complete
the
expansion
but
gave
no
precise
financial
details
and
stressed
he
felt
the
project
should
be
returned
to
the
private
sector
canada
s
oil
sector
has
been
stung
in
the
past
year
as
foreign
energy
companies
retreated
amid
concerns
about
the
environmental
toll
high
production
costs
and
a
risky
regulatory
regime
we
have
agreed
to
a
fair
price
for
our
shareholders
said
steve
kean
chief
executive
officer
of
kinder
morgan
canada
and
kinder
morgan
kean
did
not
say
why
he
decided
to
sell
rather
than
absorb
the
risk
of
further
delays
kinder
morgan
canada
will
continue
to
own
the
remaining
assets
including
crude
storage
rail
terminals
and
a
condensate
pipeline
and
look
to
expand
i
think
the
transaction
is
a
it
s
actually
better
for
kinder
morgan
than
it
is
for
canada
they
are
getting
a
very
good
value
said
paul
bloom
at
bloom
investment
counsel
inc
which
owns
about
shares
in
kinder
morgan
canada
the
fact
the
federal
government
needed
to
buy
trans
mountain
to
ensure
the
project
goes
ahead
does
not
bode
well
for
the
industry
said
chris
bloomer
ceo
of
the
canadian
energy
pipeline
association
trans
mountain
stirred
an
unusual
public
fight
between
neighboring
provinces
alberta
threatened
to
halt
crude
and
fuel
shipments
to
british
columbia
where
consumers
already
pay
high
gasoline
prices
and
briefly
halted
imports
of
the
coastal
province
s
wines
alberta
will
contribute
up
to
c
billion
toward
unforeseen
costs
payable
once
the
project
is
complete
premier
rachel
notley
said
the
contribution
will
convert
into
equity
in
the
pipeline
british
columbia
premier
john
horgan
said
the
province
would
push
ahead
with
a
court
case
to
establish
its
right
to
restrict
increased
shipments
of
crude
oil
to
its
coastal
waters
