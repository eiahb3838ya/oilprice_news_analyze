tapping the lithium rush, canadian miner stakes claims in utah
washington
march
reuters
a
small
canadian
mining
company
has
staked
claim
to
mineral
rights
on
over
a
hundred
thousand
acres
of
federal
land
in
utah
since
last
year
hoping
to
tap
lithium
deposits
from
spent
oil
wells
to
feed
america
s
battery
industry
the
play
by
mgx
minerals
is
part
of
a
global
scramble
for
the
metal
used
in
smart
phones
electric
vehicles
and
storage
for
power
generated
by
wind
and
solar
installations
mgx
minerals
shares
have
surged
percent
this
year
to
c
still
analysts
were
divided
over
prospects
of
the
move
the
company
said
it
was
encouraged
by
president
donald
trump
s
administration
s
move
this
year
to
encourage
more
production
of
lithium
and
other
metals
on
a
list
of
critical
minerals
it
says
are
important
for
national
security
officials
understand
that
the
needs
a
supply
of
lithium
and
is
cognizant
of
global
competition
said
mgx
ceo
jared
lazerson
in
an
interview
he
called
utah
one
of
the
best
places
to
start
for
lithium
for
north
the
united
states
currently
has
only
one
active
lithium
operation
owned
by
albemarle
corp
in
nevada
and
imports
more
than
half
the
lithium
it
consumes
other
companies
including
westwater
resources
us
lithium
corp
and
pure
energy
are
also
trying
to
develop
new
lithium
projects
in
the
united
states
to
feed
rising
demand
mgx
is
focusing
its
mineral
rights
claims
on
southeastern
utah
s
paradox
basin
a
productive
oil
and
gas
drilling
area
the
company
plans
to
extract
lithium
from
drilling
wastewater
using
a
proprietary
filtration
system
it
has
piloted
in
western
canada
s
oil
patch
much
of
the
world
s
lithium
is
filtered
from
underground
brines
though
relatively
little
is
extracted
from
petroleum
wastewater
the
volumes
of
which
have
been
increasing
in
the
united
states
due
to
a
production
boom
in
this
fundamental
shift
we
are
in
between
fossil
fuels
and
renewable
energy
we
get
these
hybrid
models
lazerson
said
referring
to
his
company
s
technology
analysts
have
given
the
venture
mixed
reviews
think
about
drilling
a
hole
meters
long
through
rock
to
hit
brine
in
utah
and
coming
up
with
negligible
lithium
said
jon
hykawy
a
battery
minerals
analyst
at
stormcrow
capital
wildcatting
for
water
is
probably
not
a
great
business
stephan
bogner
an
analyst
for
rockstone
research
was
more
optimistic
if
mgx
can
prove
commercial
a
big
rethinking
may
begin
in
the
united
states
as
to
where
capital
should
be
deployed
he
said
it
would
be
a
despite
burgeoning
demand
for
lithium
from
battery
producers
around
the
world
some
analysts
believe
the
market
for
the
metal
is
headed
for
a
glut
on
monday
morgan
stanley
sent
lithium
stocks
tumbling
when
it
forecast
a
surplus
in
that
would
drive
prices
down
to
half
their
current
level
some
industry
officials
took
issue
with
the
outlook
lazerson
said
he
has
been
told
by
companies
to
get
them
anything
that
has
any
lithium
in
he
did
not
disclose
details
lazerson
said
wastewater
brines
available
in
southeastern
utah
are
relatively
rich
in
lithium
for
north
america
with
content
as
high
as
parts
per
million
the
company
hired
utah
land
acquisition
company
plateau
ventures
to
stake
out
claims
in
the
area
and
it
hopes
to
start
commercial
production
of
lithium
from
the
holdings
within
months
you
have
tesla
and
gm
bringing
electric
vehicles
on
line
with
no
significant
new
source
of
lithium
everyone
is
struggling
for
feedstock
right
now
he
said
he
said
he
could
not
disclose
the
companies
with
which
mcx
is
in
supply
talks
an
official
for
electric
car
maker
tesla
inc
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
gm
spokesman
tony
cervone
said
the
company
would
not
publicly
comment
on
specific
sourcing
of
commodities
the
geological
survey
said
in
a
report
last
month
that
global
lithium
consumption
rose
more
than
percent
in
to
tons
driven
by
surging
electric
vehicle
production
in
china
and
elsewhere
with
prices
rising
worldwide
in
the
united
states
prices
rose
more
than
percent
to
a
metric
ton
lithium
supply
security
has
become
a
top
priority
for
technology
companies
in
the
united
states
and
asia
the
report
noted
chile
and
australia
are
currently
the
world
s
top
lithium
producers
accounting
for
more
than
half
of
global
output
mgx
s
most
advanced
projects
are
in
alberta
where
it
holds
over
a
million
acres
of
mineral
rights
in
january
the
company
concentrated
lithium
from
heavy
oil
waste
water
in
the
province
using
its
rapid
filtration
process
with
results
confirmed
by
the
saskatchewan
research
council
lazerson
said
the
company
s
pilot
plant
in
calgary
is
on
