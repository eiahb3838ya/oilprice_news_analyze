diesel vehicle refits costly and could affect performance, vw says
berlin
reuters
volkswagen
is
not
against
upgrading
the
exhaust
systems
of
older
diesel
cars
to
make
them
cleaner
but
could
not
afford
to
pay
for
such
a
huge
undertaking
itself
and
is
concerned
it
might
impair
vehicle
performance
its
ceo
said
after
germany
s
top
administrative
court
on
tuesday
allowed
local
authorities
to
bar
heavily
polluting
diesel
cars
in
major
cities
the
federal
government
is
scrambling
to
find
ways
to
avert
driving
bans
that
would
hurt
consumers
and
automakers
environmental
and
motorist
lobbies
are
raising
the
pressure
on
volkswagen
vw
and
its
peers
to
modify
the
exhaust
systems
of
older
diesels
which
they
say
are
a
major
source
of
toxic
nitrogen
oxide
emissions
that
can
cause
respiratory
disease
i
don
t
want
to
say
now
that
i
m
ruling
it
out
vw
chief
executive
matthias
mueller
said
on
friday
at
an
auto
industry
event
but
he
voiced
misgivings
hardware
changes
would
cost
between
and
euros
per
car
and
the
development
as
well
as
testing
of
new
exhaust
cleaning
systems
would
take
years
mueller
said
also
retrofitted
vehicles
might
consume
more
fuel
and
emit
more
carbon
dioxide
which
would
affect
the
level
of
car
tax
he
added
of
the
million
diesel
cars
on
germany
s
roads
only
million
are
equipped
with
the
latest
emissions
technology
research
firm
evercore
isi
has
estimated
that
upgrading
the
exhaust
cleaning
of
the
million
vehicles
could
cost
up
to
billion
euros
billion
i
would
compare
hardware
changes
on
a
vehicle
to
an
surgery
mueller
said
there
is
no
way
that
vw
could
shoulder
major
costs
for
such
modifications
as
it
is
stretched
by
the
costs
and
fines
related
to
its
dieselgate
emissions
scandal
he
said
we
had
to
pay
about
billion
in
america
we
can
not
again
pay
billion
for
hardware
refits
mueller
said
that
