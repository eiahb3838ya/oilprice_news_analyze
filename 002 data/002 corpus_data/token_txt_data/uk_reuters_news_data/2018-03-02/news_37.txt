the
spectre
of
a
global
trade
war
sent
world
stocks
tumbling
towards
a
percent
weekly
loss
on
friday
and
left
bruised
investors
reaching
for
the
traditional
antidotes
government
bonds
gold
and
the
japanese
yen
the
falls
came
after
president
donald
trump
said
the
united
states
would
impose
tariffs
of
percent
on
imported
steel
and
percent
on
aluminium
sparking
concerns
of
retaliatory
moves
from
major
trade
partners
china
europe
and
neighbouring
canada
europe
s
stoxx
index
fell
over
percent
led
by
a
near
percent
slump
from
world
s
biggest
steelmaker
arcelormittal
sa
and
percent
drops
from
the
region
s
carmakers
worried
that
they
might

wall

also
pointing

would

a
fourth

trump
s
first
friday
tweet
said
which
only
acted
to
inflame
the
markets
nerves
the
dollar
and
treasury
yields
both
fell
as
they
appeared
to
push
aside
considerations
of
inflation
a
major
theme
that
spooked
financial
markets
over
the
last
month
treasuries
yields
dipped
to
percent
hitting
its
lowest
level
in
three
weeks
and
further
extending
the
distance
from
its
peak
of
percent
touched
on
feb
the
dollar
fell
across
the
board
including
to
more
than
one
year
low
against
the
yen
at
it
is
a
real
worry
because
europe
is
a
open
global
economy
so
it
isn
t
just
about
versus
china
said
ian
ormiston
a
european
equity
fund
manager
at
old
mutual
global
investors
about
trump
s
moves
and
we
will
see
retaliation
there
are
no
two
ways
about
europe
s
market
moves
compounded
what
was
already
a
fragile
mood
ahead
of
a
crunch
few
days
of
politics
britain
s
prime
minister
theresa
may
will
flesh
out
her
brexit
plans
later
while
germany
will
find
out
if
it
finally
has
a
coalition
government
on
sunday
with
italy
also
holding
elections
that
day
combined
with
the
simmering
trade
war
nerves
it
was
unsurprising
then
that
demand
was
on
the
rise
german
bunds
europe
s
credit
market
benchmark
saw
their
yields
fall
to
a
low
of
percent
as
italy
s
btp
yields
dropped
to
a
low
of
percent
i
am
surprised
how
little
risk
the
market
is
pricing
from
this
said
the
chief
investment
officer
of
pictet
wealth
management
cesar
perez
ruiz
referring
to
the
italian
elections
the
trade
nerves
had
dominated
asian
market
moves
japan
s
nikkei
tumbled
percent
to
end
the
week
down
while
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
excluding
japan
dropped
percent
to
take
its
losses
for
the
week
to

steelmakers
were
hit
the
hardest
there
too
with
south
korea
s
posco
down
percent
and
japan
s
nippon
steel
off
percent
toyota
motor
shares
skidded
percent
too
after
the
automaker
had
said
the
planned
tariffs
would
substantially
raise
the
production
costs
and
therefore
prices
of
cars
and
trucks
sold
in
america
on
thursday
on
wall
street
the
s
p
had
lost
points
or
percent
to
coming
a
day
after
a
another
heavy
sell
on
worries
the
federal
reserve
might
increase
it
interest
rates
more
than
expected
this
year
the
anxiety
over
trade
tariff
moves
was
underscored
by
canada
s
quick
response
with
officials
in
ottawa
saying
they
will
retaliate
china
and
the
eu
both
followed
saying
that
they
will
safeguard
their
interests
the
measures
that
we
are
prepared
to
take
will
prove
that
we
will
on
the
basis
of
the
rules
not
hesitate
to
protect
our
industry
a
european
commission
spokesman
said
the
concerns
also
eclipsed
upbeat
economic
data
including
a
high
in
manufacturing
figures
and
a
low
in
the
number
of
americans
filing
for
unemployment

dogged
by
suspicions
that
the
trump
administration
prefers
a
weaker

to
help
narrow
the

yawning
trade
deficit
worries
that
trump
s
big
tax
cuts
and
spending
plans
will
ramp
up
fiscal
deficits
to
the
extent
that
they
undermine
confidence
in

also
hurt
the
greenback

it

been
