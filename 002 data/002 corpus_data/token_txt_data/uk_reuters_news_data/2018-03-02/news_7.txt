new

reuters
more
than
three
years
after
the
collapse
in
oil
prices
states
such
as
alaska
oklahoma
and
louisiana
continue
to
struggle
with
budget
shortfalls
and
fiscal
is
no
different
as
lawmakers
seek
permanent
revenue
solutions
states
that
benefited
from
the
energy
boom
were
left
reeling
when
prices
collapsed
in
leading
to
a
continuous
scramble
to
make
up
for
lost
revenue
alaska
which
depended
heavily
on
revenues
from
oil
activity
dealt
with
the
sudden
fiscal
pressures
by
tapping
into
reserve
funds
and
cutting
spending
some
say
the
fiscal
uncertainty
surrounding
the
state
has
impacted
private
sector
investment
the
state
s
proposed
capital
budget
for
fiscal
is
million
down
from
nearly
billion
in
fiscal
a
drop
of
more
than
percent
it
still
faces
a
budget
deficit
of
billion
for
next
year
less
state
funding
doesn
t
instill
a
lot
of
confidence
in
private
investors
said
john
mackinnon
the
executive
director
of
the
associated
general
contractors
of
alaska
as
a
result
employees
in
the
state
s
construction
industry
are
working
fewer
hours
mackinnon
said
noting
that
carpenters
hours
were
down
by
percent
in
versus
the
amount
of
money
invested
by
public
and
private
sources
in
construction
projects
in
alaska
has
decreased
from
billion
in
to
a
projected
billion
in
according
to
data
from
the
institute
of
social
and
economic
research
iser
at
the
university
of
alaska
anchorage
and
the
number
of
alaskans
employed
in
the
construction
business
statewide
excluding
public
and
workers
has
also
decreased
from
an
average
of
workers
in
to
a
projected
average
of
in
the
data
said
alaska
has
also
not
authorized
any
new
general
obligation
bond
issuance
since
when
voters
approved
of
million
of
debt
according
to
the
state
s
office
of
management
and
budget
omb
as
of
june
million
of
that
debt
was
unissued
the
office
said
the
fiscal
situation
is
such
that
taking
on
additional
liabilities
is
not
a
smart
thing
to
do
at
the
moment
said
scott
goldsmith
professor
emeritus
of
economics
at
iser
barring
any
legislative
actions
the
state
s
constitutional
budget
reserve
its
primary
reserve
account
could
be
empty
by
april
said
pat
pitney
the
omb
s
director
pitney
said
she
also
feels
that
private
investment
has
been
pulling
back
from
the
state
we
have
businessmen
saying
i
m
not
investing
in
alaska
because
there
s
uncertainty
and
i
m
putting
my
money
somewhere
else
or
i
m
going
to
wait
she
said
in
louisiana
and
oklahoma
legislators
also
face
budget
deficits
for
the
next
fiscal
year
having
attempted
to
fill
past
shortfalls
with
temporary
tax
increases
and
fixes
respectively
louisiana
faces
a
fiscal
cliff
totaling
roughly
billion
because
of
a
sunset
on
temporary
tax
increases
adopted
in
fiscal
and
fiscal
and
set
to
expire
in
the
decline
in
the
oil
industry
in
part
drove
the
tax
increases
said
manfred
dix
an
economist
with
the
state
s
office
of
planning
and
budget
we
can
not
depend
on
crude
oil
dramatically
increasing
again
dix
said
oklahoma
s
challenges
stem
from
a
combination
of
low
oil
prices
and
extensive
actions
from
the
legislature
said
marcy
block
an
analyst
at
fitch
ratings
the
state
faces
a
deficit
of
about
million
oklahoma
governor
mary
fallin
has
criticized
the
legislature
in
the
past
for
failing
to
find
solutions
to
recurring
deficits
while
oil
prices
have
ticked
up
in
the
last
half
year
analysts
and
government
employees
reached
by
reuters
do
not
expect
a
return
to
their
levels
anytime
soon
if
at
all
crude

far
below
the

states
in
should
experience
positive
economic
growth
however
fitch

on
that
while
oil
prices
and
production
have
edged
higher
states
seem
to
be
tempering
their
revenue
and
price
forecasts
we
are
going
to
be
low
for
a
while
and
they
states
need
to
align
their
budgets
to
that
