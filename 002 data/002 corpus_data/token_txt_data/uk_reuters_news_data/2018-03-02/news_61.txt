said

and
neighbouring
canada
in
a

to
the

trade
is
just
about
the
only
thing
economists
are
agreed
on
more
is
msci

of

outside

led
by
a

toyota

coming
a
day
after
investors
sold
off
heavily
on
worries
the
federal

might
increase
rates
more
than
expected
this
year
trump
s
latest
trade
salvo
comes
after
washington
slapped
steep
tariffs
on
imports
of
solar
panels
and
washing
machines
in
january
prompting
china
to
launch
an
and
investigation
into
imports
of
sorghum
from
the
united
states
the
anxiety
over
moves
was
underscored
by
canada
s
quick
response
with
officials
in
ottawa
saying
they
will
retaliate
against
any
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
products
with
markets
fretting
about
the
pace
of
rate
hikes
this
year
the
worry
is
that
escalating
trade
protectionism
would
dent
world
growth
and
corporate
earning
key
drivers
of
a
rally
in
equities
last
year
the
concerns
of
a
harmful
trade
war
eclipsed
the
upbeat
economic
data
published
on
thursday
including
a
rise
in
the
manufacturing
index
to

even
if
you

if
someone

you
have

economic
activities

daisuke

chief

at

i
would
expect
markets
entered
another
period
of
correction
he
added
treasury
yields
fell
as
the
risk
of
a
trade
war
appeared
to
push
aside
considerations
of
inflation
a
major
theme
that
spooked
global
financial
markets
earlier
this
year
the
treasuries
yield
fell
to

hitting
its
lowest
level
in
three
weeks
and
further

trump
has
been
repeatedly
boasting
about
rise
in
share
prices
if
this
is
going
to
lead
to
a
sustained
