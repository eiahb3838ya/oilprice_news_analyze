update 2-gazprom seeks to halt ukraine gas contracts as dispute escalates
reuters
russia
s
gazprom
said
on
friday
it
would
terminate
its
gas
contracts
with
ukraine
after
it
lost
a
court
case
escalating
a
dispute
which
has
left
ukraine
struggling
to
stay
warm
and
which
the
eu
said
could
threaten
gas
flows
to
europe
a
stockholm
arbitration
court
ordered
gazprom
this
week
to
pay
more
than
billion
to
ukrainian
energy
firm
naftogaz
a
ruling
meant
to
conclude
a
long
legal
battle
that
has
run
alongside
ukraine
s
broader
political
with
russia
but
after
the
court
decision
gazprom
did
not
restart
gas
supplies
to
ukraine
as
expected
on
thursday
forcing
kiev
to
take
emergency
measures
to
make
up
for
the
shortfall
and
warn
that
transit
flows
to
europe
were
at
risk
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
supplies
from
russia
kiev
has
suspended
lessons
at
schools
universities
and
kindergartens
until
next
week
switched
power
stations
from
gas
to
fuel
oil
and
bought
extra
gas
from
poland
ukrainian
president
petro
poroshenko
said
gazprom
had
no
right
to
suspend
its
contracts
and
he
expected
them
to
remain
in
force
the
moves
showed
that
the
russian
gas
giant
was
not
a
reliable
supplier
he
said
the
threat
of
a
supply
cut
to
europe
comes
as
the
continent
has
been
hit
by
a
cold
spell
driving
up
demand
in
a
statement
gazprom
ceo
alexei
miller
said
the
court
s
ruling
meant
the
company
s
gas
deals
with
ukraine
would
no
longer
be
commercially
viable
so
it
had
no
choice
but
to
ask
the
court
to
terminate
them
gazprom
had
to
immediately
start
the
procedure
of
the
termination
of
the
contracts
with
naftogaz
on
gas
supplies
and
transit
at
the
stockholm
arbitration
court
miller
said
naftogaz
declined
immediate
comment
on
the
decision
on
twitter
ukrainian
foreign
minister
pavlo
klimkin
said
yesterday
i
called
gazprom
con
artists
but
today
they
are
behaving
like
poker
players
and
trying
to
raise
the
stakes
only
it
s
not
clear
what
they
re
playing
or
with
the
row
represents
a
new
chapter
in
a
disagreement
that
prompted
russia
to
suspend
gas
exports
to
europe
notably
in
the
winters
of
and
european
union
commission
vice
president
maros
sefcovic
said
brussels
was
concerned
not
only
about
the
supply
of
gas
to
ukraine
but
also
about
the
transit
of
gas
to
the
bloc
the
commission
stands
ready
to
steer
a
trilateral
process
which
in
the
past
has
already
proven
to
be
effective
in
situations
of
disagreement
sefcovic
said
in
a
statement
ukraine
is
the
main
route
for
the
russian
gas
to
europe
where
gazprom
accounts
for
around
percent
of
the
market
ukraine
and
russia
have
had
a
complex
dispute
over
gas
prices
for
years
which
blew
up
when
the
two
countries
became
enemies
after
a
leader
of
ukraine
was
toppled
in
moscow
responded
that
year
by
seizing
ukraine
s
crimea
peninsula
and
backing
separatists
in
eastern
ukraine
where
fighting
has
killed
people
in
one
of
its
rulings
the
stockholm
court
ordered
naftogaz
to
buy
billion
cubic
meters
of
gas
from
gazprom
a
year
from
the
march
deliveries
would
have
been
the
first
time
ukraine
bought
gas
directly
from
russia
since
november
when
it
started
buying
gas
from
europe
via
reverse
flows
to
try
to
cut
its
energy
dependency
on
moscow
last
year
gazprom
supplied
a
record
high
billion
cubic
meters
of
gas
to
europe
excluding
former
soviet
states
and
turkey
transit
of
russian
gas
jumped
by
almost
percent
to
bcm
via
ukraine
a
gazprom
spokesman
did
not
respond
to
a
request
to
comment
on
possible
risks
to
the
