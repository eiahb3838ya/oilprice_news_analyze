brasilia
march
reuters
brazilian
aluminum
producers
are
concerned
that
president
donald
trump
is
launching
into
a
trade
war
with
china
that
will
ricochet
on
the
world
market
and
depress
prices
if
chinese
exporters
have
to
find
other
buyers
brazil
is
not
a
big
exporter
of
aluminum
products
to
the
united
states
but
a
tariff
war
between
the
world
s
largest
importer
and
china
its
biggest
exporter
will
inevitably
bring
volatility
to
a
market
where
prices
were
recovering
said
milton
rego
president
of
the
brazilian
aluminum
association
brazil
has
to
watch
out
this
is
a
fight
between
elephants
in
a
small
room
and
at
the
first
move
someone
else
is
going
to
get
thrown
out
of
the
window
rego
said
by
telephone
trump
announced
on
thursday
he
would
impose
hefty
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminum
imports
to
protect
producers
risking
retaliation
from
major
trade
partners
like
china
and
europe
rego
expects
the
cost
of
aluminum
will
rise
in
the
united
states
where
premiums
over
lme
prices
are
already
climbing
while
world
prices
will
drop
when
chinese
aluminum
plate
sheet
and
foil
look
for
alterative
markets
that
is
bad
news
for
brazil
s
shrinking
aluminum
industry
which
has
lost
half
its
capacity
in
recent
years
due
to
plant
closures
caused
by
high
electricity
costs
rego
said
brazil
is
the
source
of
steel
imports
into
the
united
states
after
canada
accounting
for
percent
of
volume
in
and
its
steel
industry
risks
significant
damage
from
tariffs
the
brazilian
government
expressed
enormous
concern
about
the
proposed
tariffs
and
said
brazil
may
take
multilateral
or
bilateral
action
to
protect
its
interests
