which
has
been
shut
since
a
powerful
earthquake
on
monday
an
industry
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
on
friday
at
least
people
were
killed
by
the
magnitude
quake
and
prime

has
declared
a

exxon
shut
its
billion
lng
facility
the
country
s
biggest
export
earner
amid
fears
of
damage
to
gas
field
infrastructure
and
the
pipeline
that
carries
gas
to
the
coast
exxon
declined
to
comment
on
friday
on
whether
it
had
invoked
force
majeure
a
company
spokeswoman
reiterated
that
the
company
was
focusing
on
assessing
damage
from
the
earthquake
a
process
that
is
expected
to
take
time
particularly
given
the
damage
to
roads
and
other
we
are
continuing
to
work
with
our
customers
to
minimize
the
impact
on

exxon
had
earlier
told
buyers
that
the

s
two

would
be
shut
for
at

seven
days
the
png
lng
project
has
been
producing
at
around
percent
above
its
rated
capacity
of
million
tonnes
a
year
asian
lng
market
sources
say
there
are
concerns
about
a
possible
extended
shutdown
which
could
affect
not
only
the
project
s
four
main
buyers
but
also
other
buyers
in
asia
it
is
difficult
to
assess
the
duration
of
production
outages
but
in
our
view
given
the
location
and
magnitude
of
the
earthquake
as
well
as
the
scale
of
the
aftershocks
we
anticipate
at
least
a
month
s
downtime
is
likely
ubs
analysts
said
in
a
note
this
week
uncertainty
around
production
from
png
has
drained
liquidity
from
asia

spot

markets
with
buyers
and
sellers
taking
a
approach
before
committing
to
trade

source
said
this
is
reflected
in
the
wide
spread
on
the
contract
for
april
he
added
the

project
is
considered
one
of
the
