gauging

the

the

had
seen

said
two

with
knowledge
of
the
matter
while
the
winter
in
north
asia
is
showing
signs
of
tapering
off
most
of
europe
has
been
caught
by
a
wave
of
extreme
cold
late
in
the
season
which
pushed
up
british
spot
natural
gas
prices
to
record
highs
of
pence
per

on

the
equivalent
of

mmbtu
and
up
percent
from
the
last
close
in
february
and
up
percent
since
the
end
of
december
the
spike
was
a
result
of
extreme
cold
across
western
europe
caused
by
unusual
siberian
winds
which
the
media
has
dubbed
the
beast
from
the

and
which
caused
a
surge
in
