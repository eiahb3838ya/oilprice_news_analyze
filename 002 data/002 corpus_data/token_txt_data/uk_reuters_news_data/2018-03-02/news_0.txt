mplementing
the
paris
climate
agreement
by
investing
trillions
of
dollars
to
slow
greenhouse
gas
emissions
would
be
far
cheaper
than
paying
the
costs
of
people
sickened
by
polluted
air
scientists
said
on
friday
governments
worldwide
could
save
trillion
in
health
care
by
investing
less
than
half
that
amount
in
green
projects
by
researchers
said
in
a
study
published
in
the
lancet
planetary
health
an
online
academic
journal
such
an
investment
would
result
in
million
fewer
premature
deaths
related
to
air
pollution
said
the
study

jon
sampedro
a
researcher
at
spain
s
basque
centre
for
climate
change
the
paris
agreement
reached
in
by
nearly
countries
committed
to
curbing
greenhouse
emissions
enough
to
keep
the
global
hike
in
temperatures
well
below
degrees
celsius
fahrenheit
above
times
while
pursuing
efforts
for
a
far
tougher
c
ceiling
a
united
nations
draft
report
earlier
this
year
projected
that
unless
governments
take
unprecedented
measures
the
global
temperature
rise
is
on
track
to
exceed
the
accord
s
tougher
target
authors
of
the
study
said
their
calculations
of
steep
savings
could
convince
to
adopt
more
aggressive
policies
to
curb
human
emissions
of
greenhouse
gasses
that
include
carbon
dioxide
from
burning
fossil
fuels
we
hope
that
might
help
policymakers
move
towards
adopting
more
ambitious
climate
policies
and
measures
to
reduce
air
pollution

a
professor
at
the
basque
centre
in
a
statement
the
team
of
researchers
from
spain
the
united
states
and
italy
ran
computer
models
that
combined
future
estimates
of
emissions
air
deaths
and
healthcare
benefits
for
the
entire
world
achieving
the
highest
levels
of
savings
would
require
china
and
india
making
the
largest
joint
investment
some
trillion
to
tackle
climate
change
the
study
said
the
two
countries
would
then
save
most
by
having
healthier
populations
it
said
together
china
and
india
account
for
about
a
third
of
global
emissions

the
paris
agreement
allowed
nations
to
set
their
own
targets
to
slow
climate
change
with
no

for
president
donald
trump
announced
last
year
he
was
pulling
the
united
states
the
world
s
second
biggest
emitter
of

out
of

china
is
the
biggest

isolates
the

as
the
