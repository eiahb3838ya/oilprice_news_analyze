threatening
to
disrupt
the
inauguration
of
a
mega
dam
that
has
uprooted
them
from
their
traditional
lands
campaigners
said
on
friday
resistance
to
the
dam
is
seen
as
part
of
a
growing
movement
across
the
country
against
large
infrastructure
projects
which
activists
say
do
not
benefit
the
very
people
forced
to
give
up
their
land
officials
said
the
mapithel
dam
in
manipur
state
is
due
to
be
opened
on
march
nearly
years
since
construction
began
and
that
it
will
vastly
increase
access
to
drinking
water
irrigation
and
electricity
but
those
benefits
won
t
even
go
to
the
affected
communities
who
sacrificed
their
land
river
forest
and
resources
said
activist
jajo
themson
more
protests
are
planned
he
said
adding
that
previous
demonstrations
were
put
down
with
violence
in
a
state
where
armed
forces
have
special
privileges
to
tackle
a
insurgency
pritam
singh
chief
engineer
of
manipur
s
irrigation
and
flood
control
department
denied
the
use
of
force
against
lawful
protests
all
necessary
permissions
for
the
dam
were
obtained
and
adequate
compensation
was
given
to
those
affected
said
singh
some
people
did
not
take
the
compensation
but
that
is
a
different
matter
rehabilitation
of
five
of
the
six
affected
villages
has
been
completed
he
told
the

almost

selling
sandstone
that
used
to
be
washed
downstream
according
to
yumnam
the
dam
has
an
annual
irrigation
potential
of
about
hectares

the
state
capital
imphal
and
surrounding
areas
by
more
than
million
litres
a
day
according
to
a
government
audit
the
project
will
generate
megawatts
for
rural
electrification
yumnam
said
authorities
did
not
assess
the
dam
s
impact
on
the
environment
and
residents
who
he
said
were
not
consulted
we
should
not
proceed
with
this
until
we
can
be
sure
of
its
impact
