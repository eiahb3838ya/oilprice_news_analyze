ukraine
has
switched
power
plants
to
fuel
oil
from
gas
in
an
effort
to
make
up
for
an
emergency
shortage
after
russian
company
gazprom
declined
to
resume
gas
supplies
to
the
country
energy
minister
ihor
nasalyk
said
on
friday
the
shortfall
comes
at
a
time
of
peak
demand
after
a
cold
snap
blanketed
most
of
ukraine
with
heavy
snow
and
pushed
temperatures
well
below
freezing
nasalyk
told
parliament
the
lack
of
russian
supplies
had
created
a
deficit
of
up
to
million
cubic
meters
mcm
of
gas
per
day
thermal
power
plants
switching
to
fuel
oil
could
save
around
million
mcm
a
day
he
said
the
energy
ministry
also
asked
local
authorities
to
suspend
lessons
at
schools
universities
and
kindergartens
until
march
the
gas
shortage
equates
to
one
tenth
of
ukraine
s
daily
consumption
of
around
mcm
on
thursday
gazprom
said
it
had
returned
a
prepayment
to
ukraine
and
would
not
restart
gas
supplies
as
an
additional
agreement
to
the
existing
arrangements
had
not
yet
been
reached
ukraine
said
it
would
seek
compensation
the
row
represents
a
new
front
in
a
legal
battle
a
of
broader
political
tension
following
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
in
and
support
for
separatists
in
eastern
ukraine

follows
wednesday
s
international
arbitration
court
order

to
pay
billion
to
ukraine

naftogaz
after
weighing

claims
and
related
