washington
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
on
thursday
proposed
changes
to
rules
regulating
coal
ash
waste
from
power
plants
that
it
said
would
give
states
more
flexibility
over
its
disposal
and
save
electric
utilities
up
to
million
a
year
in
compliance
costs
the
proposal
includes
more
than
a
dozen
changes
to
an
rule
that
established
minimum
national
standards
for
the
disposal
of
coal
ash
a
byproduct
of
power
plants
that
contains
toxic
materials
such
as
arsenic

embodies
epa
s
commitment
to
our

providing
them
with
the
ability
to
incorporate
flexibilities
into
their
coal
ash
permit
programs
based
on
the
needs
of
their
states
epa
administrator
scott
pruitt
said
in
a
statement
in
september
the
epa
said
it
would
reconsider
the
rule
after
utility
industry
groups
petitioned
for
changes
environmental
groups
warned
in
september
that
if
the
epa
rolled
back
the
safeguards
it
would
put
the
public
at
risk
because
coal
ash
pits
are
located
near
waterways
and
groundwater
the
agency
said
it
would
be
accepting
public
comment
on
the
proposal
