reuters
president
donald
trump
urged
representatives
from
the
rival
oil
and
corn
industries
on
thursday
to
break
a
deadlock
in
talks
over
the
future
of
the
nation
s
biofuels
policy
by
accepting
a
deal
involving
reforms
sought
by
both
sides
trump
has
arranged
a
series
of
talks
between
big
corn
and
big
oil
since
late
last
year
amid
rising
concern
in
the
white
house
over
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
a
law
requiring
refiners
to
mix
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
into
their
fuel
the
policy
was
intended
to
help
farmers
and
reduce
petroleum
imports
but
has
increasingly
divided
farmers
and
energy
companies
two
of
trump
s
most
important
constituencies
refining
company
philadelphia
energy
solutions
llc
in
the
key
electoral
state
of
pennsylvania
in
january
blamed
the
rfs
for
its
bankruptcy
a
source
who
attended
thursday
s
meeting
at
the
white
house
said
trump
told
the
gathering
of
lawmakers
and
corporate
executives
that
he
supports
a
proposal
from
the
refining
industry
to
cap
the
price
of
biofuels
blending
credits
that
refiners
must
acquire
to
comply
with
the
rfs
prices
for
the
blending
credits
which
refiners
must
either
earn
or
purchase
have
surged
in
recent
years
upsetting
companies
that
in
some
cases
are
spending
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
on
them
the
source
who
asked
not
to
be
named
because
he
is
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
on
the
discussion
said
trump
also
expressed
support
for
expanding
sales
of
gasoline
a
tweak
by
ethanol
producers
the
environmental
protection
agency
bans
the
use
of
gasoline
containing
percent
ethanol
during
the
summer
months
a
move
intended
to
reduce
ozone
emissions
and
smog
during
the
peak
driving
season
the
two
ideas
combined
represented
a
solution
for
the
oil
and
corn
industries
that
could
help
them
break
their
deadlock
trump
told
the
meeting
according
to
the
source
biofuel
interests
in
the
meeting
tried
to
persuade
trump
to
approve
the
waiver
and
see
if
that
drives
down
credit
prices
but
trump
rejected
the
request
saying
the
industry
needed
immediate
changes
trump
told
the
parties
that
he
wanted
credit
caps
and
greater
use
of
blended
gasoline
and
to
come
back
in
a
week
the
source
said
he
then
abruptly
ended
the
meeting
stood
and
began
to
exit
the
room
the
source
said
republican
senator
joni
ernst
of
iowa
asked
for
more
time
to
study
the
impact
of
the
price
cap
the
source
said
take
the
deal
joni
trump
said
as
he
walked
out
of
the
room
according
to
the
source
ernst
disagreed
with
the
source
s
description
it
s
not
accurate
that
exchange
didn
t
take
place
an
ernst
spokeswoman
said
via
email
on
friday
morning
the
white
house
said
after
the
meeting
that
talks
on
the
issue
would
continue
today
s
meeting
is
a
part
of
the
ongoing
effort
to
best
understand
the
many
differing
views
on
this
issue
and
the
president
looks
forward
to
continuing
this
discussion
it
said
in
a
statement
republican
senator
charles
grassley
of
corn
state
iowa
who
attended
the
meeting
said
the
talks
did
not
yield
any
final
decisions
but
that
an
emerging
solution
could
include
allowing
sales
of
percent
ethanol
fuel
he
added
that
he
opposes
a
credit
price
cap
saying
such
a
move
could
put
thousands
of
jobs
in
rural
america
at
risk
no
specific
price
cap
level
was
discussed
at
thursday
s
meeting
according
to
the
source
but
republican
senator
ted
cruz
of
texas
who
has
been
driving
efforts
to
tweak
the
rfs
on
behalf
of
refiners
and
who
attended
the
meeting
has
proposed
limiting
credit
prices
to
cents
each
a
fraction
of
their
current
value
prices
for
the
credits
called
rins
dropped
cents
to
cents
each
after
the
meeting
according
to
traders
cruz
said
in
a
statement
with
republican
senator
pat
toomey
of
pennsylvania
that
he
was
encouraged
that
president
trump
recognises
the
importance
of
providing
relief
from
crushing
rins
costs
and
expanding
the
potential
market
for
the
biofuels
industry
had
mixed
reaction
to
the
meeting
generally
supporting
the
idea
of
sales
of
blend
gasoline
but
worried
by
the
proposed
price
cap
for
credits
which
some
in
the
industry
worry
would
curtail
investment
in
new
blending
facilities
the
president
very
clearly
understands
that
the
path
forward
is
to
allow
sales
of
promote
growth
and
put
more
rins
on
the
market

nothing
new
was
discussed
in
this
meeting
removing
accountability
from

companies
would
deprive
millions
of
americans
the
freedom
to
choose
less
expensive
homegrown
biofuels
and
imperil
countless
