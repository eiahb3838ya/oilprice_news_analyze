expired
at
this

we
don
t

ganga
junior
said
angola
is
one
of
the
world
s
top
diamond
producers
but
much
of
the
territory
remains
due
to
years
of
civil
war
and
a
closed
difficult
business
environment
since
fighting
ended
in
lourenço
took
power
in
september
and
says
he
wants
to
shed
angola
s
image
as
an
opaque
oil
economy
with
rampant
corruption
he
wants
to
attract
international
investors
and
has
made
changes
to
wrest
power
from
dos
santos
pushing
out
some
of
his
key
allies
russia
s
alrosa

the
only
major
diamond
company
currently
producing
in
angola
via
its
stake
in
the
catoca
mine
one
of
the
world
s
largest
we
are
ready
to
start
from
zero
to
negotiate
in
the
best
conditions
the
best
possibilities
for
the
good
of
endiama
our
country
and
