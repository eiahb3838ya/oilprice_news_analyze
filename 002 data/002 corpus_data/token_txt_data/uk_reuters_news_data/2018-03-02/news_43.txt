canada
s
first
nations
are
boosting
investments
and
leveraging
their
clout
with
regulators
to
gain
stakes
in
oil
and
gas
projects
as
they
seek
greater
returns
on
energy
produced
or
transported
across
their
territory
aboriginal
groups
in
canada
have
traditionally
played
a
more
passive
role
in
the
energy
industry
collecting
royalties
from
oil
and
gas
output
that
model
is
changing
as
some
indigenous
groups
buy
oil
wells
and
negotiate
ownership
stakes
in
proposed
pipelines
and
storage
projects
it
s
assets
that
create
cash
flow
said
joe
dion
chief
executive
of
first
frog
lake
energy
resources
corp
which
produces
barrels
of
oil
per
day
we
get
a
piece
of
the
first
nations
also
called
bands
play
a
pivotal
role
in
canada
s
oil
industry
because
governments
and
companies
have
a
legal
duty
to
consult
and
accommodate
them
before
proceeding
with
resource
projects
affecting
their
territories
the
law
gives
bands
pretty
close
to
an
effective
veto
said
university
of
saskatchewan
professor
ken
coates
some
aboriginal
groups
have
used
that
leverage
to
stop
or
delay
oil
projects
as
when
enbridge
inc
s
proposed
northern
gateway
pipeline
was
rejected
by
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
in
after
bands
raised
environmental
concerns
other
indigenous
groups
however
are
increasingly
using
the
same
power
to
negotiate
ownership
stakes
in
projects
a
bigger
financial
role
for
first
nations
in
the
sector
could
help
unlock
oil
and
gas
reserves
in
canada
the
world
s
fifth
largest
producer
that
might
otherwise
stay
in
the
ground
because
of
objections
from
environmental
or
aboriginal
rights
groups
their
experience
parallels
that
of
native
american
tribes
who
are
also
deeply
split
on
whether
and
how
to
develop
the
vast
resources
on
tribal
lands
indigenous
canadians
make
up
about
percent
of
the
nation
s
population
and
face
higher
levels
of
poverty
and
violence
giving
bands
a
powerful
incentive
to
maximize
energy
revenues
to
raise
living
standards
it
s
so
polarized
said
stephen
buffalo
chief
executive
of
the
advocacy
group
indian
resource
council
some
want
to
see
the
benefit
others
think
it
s
going
to
kill
the
frog
lake
a
firm
owned
by
alberta
s
frog
lake
first
nation
is
looking
to
buy
more
properties
outside
of
its
territory
along
with
stakes
in
tank
farms
and
pipelines
said
dion
who
is
a
member
of
the
neighboring
kehewin
cree
nation
dion
said
aboriginal
groups
have
traditionally
settled
for
the
smaller
stuff
royalties
from
outside
energy
firms
the
piece
is
here
now
dion
said
that
is
where
we
have
to
aboriginal
groups
have
a
legal
say
in
projects
on
their
lands
which
are
held
in
trust
by
the
canadian
government
for
band
members
and
also
those
that
might
impact
them
indirectly
first
nations
support
gives
energy
firms
better
odds
of
overcoming
any
concerns
from
other
aboriginal
groups
ottawa
on
unveiled
draft
legislation
for
resource
projects
that
places
greater
emphasis
on
considering
their
impact
on
aboriginal
communities
under
the
rules
for
assessing
major
projects
to
take

next
year
such
concerns
will
be
heard
by
the

the

by
a
first

allowing
them
to
buy
a

stake
in
a
suncor
energy
storage
facility
the
deal
was
oversubscribed
saar
said
we
think
there
would
be
appetite
for
further
similar
some
investors
find
aboriginals
involvement
in
energy
projects
appealing
given
that
their
support
is
often
critical
for
regulatory
approvals
saar
said
others
however
worry
about
being
tied
to
first
nations
finances
because
of
historic
mismanagement
by
some
bands
investors
and
lenders
are
displaying
greater
acceptance
of

as
players

is
raising

for
a
c
billion
billion
oil
pipeline
proposed
to
run
from
alberta
to
the
northern
british
columbia
coast
the
project
has
modest
financial
backing
from
one
of
canada
s
richest
families
the
aquilini
group
and
support
from
first
nations
to
use
their
land
in
exchange
for
allowing
that
access
the
bands
will
own
at
least
percent
of
the
pipeline
and
a
corresponding
share
of
the
profits
if
built
eagle

would
be
a
crucial
second
outlet
to
the
pacific
ocean
for
crude
from
the
oil
sands
which
currently
sells
at
a
steep
discount
because
of
transportation
constraints
eagle

proposed
oil
pipeline
has
strong
interest
from
energy
companies
and
investors
said
eagle
spirit
president
and
chairman
calvin
helin
who
is
aboriginal
the
firm
s
main
roadblock
is
a
proposed
government
moratorium
against
oil
tankers
along
the
ecologically
sensitive
northern
coast
two
other
private
investor
groups
and
with
the
political
support
of
some
first
nations
are
proposing
to
build
railways
running
from
alberta
s
oil
sands
to
alaska
avoiding
the
coastline
of
british
columbia
because
of
the
pipeline
opposition
there
matt
vickers
head
of
declined
to
detail
the
investors
financial
arrangements
with
the
bands
new
railways
could
provide
an
alternative
to
kinder
morgan
canada
s
trans
mountain
pipeline
expansion
from
alberta
to
british
columbia
which
has
been
delayed
by
one
year
due
to
the
environmental
concerns
of
the
government
some
aboriginals
and
municipalities
when
chief
isaac
became
leader
of
alberta
s
woodland
cree
nation
in
he
was
struck
by
the
contrast
between
his
band
s
precarious
finances
and
the
hydrocarbon
wealth
surrounding
its
territory
three
years
later
signed
an
agreement
allowing
baytex
energy
corp
to
drill
in
exchange
for
modest
royalties
and
jobs
now
the
woodland
cree
are
granting
permission
for
eagle
spirit
pipeline
to
use
its
land
in
exchange
for
an
undisclosed
ownership
stake
such
opportunities
have
won
over
some
groups
trying
to
balance
economic
prosperity
with
environmental
protection
there
s
been
a
real
awakening
said
who
is
looking
for
further
investment
in
oil
and
gas
assets
everything
in
our
world
is
touched
by
oil
and
gas
whether
we
like
it
or
canadian
dollars
