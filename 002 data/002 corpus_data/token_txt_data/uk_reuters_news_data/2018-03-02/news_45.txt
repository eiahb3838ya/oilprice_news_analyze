focus-how shell hid a whale before placing mexican oil bet

the
gasps
in
the
audience
were
clearly
audible
at
the
auction
of
mexico
s
oil
blocks
a
month
ago
as
royal
dutch
shell
s
hefty
bids
were
announced
one
by
one
the
size
of
shell
s
cash
payments
million
out
of
the
total
of
million
that
mexico
earned
in
the
sale
far
outstripped
its
competitors
offers
guaranteeing
that
the
company
swept
up
nine
of
the
offshore
blocks
the
major
knew
something
no
one
else
did
six
months
earlier
its
drilling
rig
had
struck
a
giant
oil
reservoir
the
whale
well
in
the
side
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
just
across
the
border
from
many
of
the
mexican
blocks
which
share
a
similar
geology
calculating
that
this
significantly
increased
the
chances
of
the
mexican

also
containing

of
the

told

the

us
significant
the
geological
intelligence
gleaned
from
the
whale
discovery
explains
why
shell
bid
so
aggressively
for
the
mexican
blocks
something
that
had
confounded
industry
experts
it
could
also
offer
insight
into
the
rationale
underpinning
its
bet
that
latin
america
particularly
mexico
and
brazil
will
be
a
major
source
of
new
reserves
as
its
current
resources
dwindle
shell
or
any
other
explorer
is
not
legally
obliged
to
publicly
disclose
a
discovery
the
fact
that
its
first
major
exploration
success
in
over
years
came
adjacent
to
blocks
coming
up
for
auction
was
a
matter
of
good
fortune
while
the
timing
of
the
announcement
was
canny
shell
has
not
yet
released
any
estimates
for
the
whale
s
recoverable
resources
but
two
industry
sources
close
to
the
exploration
project
put
the
figure
at
up
to
million
barrels
of
oil
that
equates
to
about
half
of
shell
s
oil
production
and
would
make
the
reservoir
one
of
the
biggest
discoveries
of
the
past
decade
in
the
industry
shell
declined
to
comment
on
the
potential
size
of
the
reserves
fossil
fuels
like
oil
are
formed
over
millions
of
years
in
specific
rock
formations
which
geologists
and
explorers
try
to
identify
via
seismic
studies
and
drilling
to
predict
where
resources
might
be
found
but
even
though
a
similar
geology
might
increase
the
chances
of
similar
exploration
success
there
are
no
guarantees
and
luck
is
always
a
big
factor
so
there
is
no
certainty
that
the
mexican
blocks
will
yield
commercial
volumes
of
oil

shell
acquired
large
amounts
of
specialized
seismic
data
before
the
auction
about
whale
and
the
mexican
blocks
to
try
to
gain
a
better
sense
of
the
geological
formations
and
potential
oil
reserves
under
the
seabed
according
to
a
source
at
an
oil
services
company
that
provides
such
information
even
for
us
it
was
surprising
the
way
shell
bid
during
mexico
s
deepwater
auction
they
really
wanted
the
blocks
close
to
the
border
which
indicates
there
must
be
a
link
between
the
formation
in
the
and
in
mexico
the
source
added
shell
needs
to
replenish
its
oil
and
gas
reserves
to
maintain
its
production
into
the
aside
from
the
billion
acquisition
of
bg
group
in
which
boosted
its
reserves
the
company
has
had
limited
success
in
recent
years
last
year
it
was
able
to
replace
only
percent
of
its
production
while
on
a
average
the
figure
was
percent
the
company
disclosed
in
its
results
the
decline
in
reserves
means
that
at
the
end
of
shell
had
enough
reserves
to
sustain
its
production
for
years
compared
with
around
years
in
ceo
ben
van
beurden
while
insisting
he
was
not
obsessed
with
the
scale
of
his
company
s
reserves
said
shell
was
starting
to
work
on
restocking
its
resources
we
have
a
deepwater
program
that
looks
pretty
good
all
the
way
into
the
next
decade
but
if
you
look
at
the
second
half
of
the
next
decade
you
will
need
new
elements
in
the
development
funnel
to
sustain
the
generation
he
told
reporters
after
the
annual
results
announcement
last
month
shell
has
now
given
itself
seven
years
to
replenish
its
exploration
program
in
order
to
sustain
its
deepwater
production
growth
well
into
the
he
added
the
company
like
many
of
its
peers
was
forced
to
dramatically
slash
spending
in
recent
years
because
of
weak
oil
prices
with
its
exploration
budgets
hit
particularly
hard
now
that
prices
have
recovered
to
a
near
high
of
around
a
barrel
firms
feel
more
confident
to
once
again
invest
in
expensive
offshore
developments
shell
owns
a
percent
stake
in
the
whale
discovery
with
the
remaining
percent
held
by
chevron
which
is
mainly
the
reservoir
is
located
in
the
perdido
area
which
has
become
a
heartland
of
shell
s
deepwater
activities
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
companies
such
as
shell
that
are
eyeing
mexico
s
offshore
are
hoping
to
use
the
vast
infrastructure
of
pipelines
and
rigs
on
the
side
to
reduce
development
