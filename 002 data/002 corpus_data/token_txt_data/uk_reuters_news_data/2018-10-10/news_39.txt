world
stocks
inched
off
lows
on
wednesday
as
borrowing
costs
held
below
peaks
though
market
gains
were
checked
by
fears
for
global
economic
growth
and
the
possibility
of
an
clash
over
budget
spending
the
effects
of
the
global
bond
selloff
that
took
bond
yields
to
highs
this
week
were
exacerbated
by
economic
growth
concerns
stemming
from
trade
conflicts
and
oil
with
the
international
monetary
fund
cutting
its
world
gdp
forecasts
for
the
first
time
in
two
years
the
imf
s
estimates
for
the
united
states
and
china
were
both
reduced
with
the
fund
predicting
the
countries
would
feel
the
brunt
of
their
trade
war
next
year
it
also
slashed
its
expectations
for
emerging
markets
for
msci
s
world
equity
index
rose
percent
after
four
days
in

however
while
japan
s
nikkei
and
msci

index
outside
japan
rose

european
shares
slipped

undermined
by
more
bellicose
rhetoric
from
italian
politicians
stocks
traded

higher
however
rising
off
lows
hit
earlier
in
the
week
wall
street
was
set
to
open
flat
to
weaker
futures
showed
there
are
also
concerns
over
china
where
the
yuan
slipped
against
the
dollar
for
the
fifth
session
out
of
the
past
six
to
approach
lows
hit
in
august
the
focus
is
on
next
week
s
report
on
currencies
amid
treasury
officials
comments
that
recent
yuan
depreciation
has
raised
concerns
in
washington
however
some
relief
came
from
treasuries
where
borrowing
costs
kept
well
below
a
peak
of
percent
we
are
at
some
sort
of
critical
moment
a
crossroads
for
bond
and
equity
markets
marie
owens
thomsen
global
head
of
economic
research
at
indosuez
wealth
management
said
noting
that
while
yields
at
percent
unequivocally
favoured
equity
investment
this
was
not
so
above
percent
this
january
we
took
out
the
percent
yield
handle
and
now
we
are
wondering
if
we
are
permanently
taking
out
the
percent
handle
as
well
that
makes
the
climate
for
equities
much
more
challenging
owens
thomsen
added
she
cautioned
though
that
signs
of
deceleration
in
world
growth
and
imf
forecast
cuts
could
curb
the
relentless
rise
in
yields
which
was
partly
fuelled
by
buoyant
economic
data
the
treasury
selloff
may
have
been
curbed
also
after
president
donald
trump
complained
said
the
federal
reserve
was
going
too
fast
in
raising
rates
but
they
rose
basis
points
to
percent
on
wednesday
also
getting
some
traction
from
europe
where
german
yields
inched
up
amid
fresh
concerns
in
italy
italian
bond
yields
pulled
off
highs
on
tuesday
after
economy
minister
giovanni
tria
pledged
action
to
restore
calm
should
market
turbulence
escalate
into
financial
crisis
yields
slipped
further
after
tria
said
he
expected
collaboration
with
the
eu
on
the
budget
issue
but
markets
pressure
has
not
dissuaded
the
government
from
a
budget
deficit
ministers
comments
appear
to
indicate
they
are
prepared
to
defy
european
union
critics
the
developments
have
raised
risks
of
a
credit
ratings
downgrade
for
the
country
with
a
effect
for
italian
banks
which
are
big
holders
of
government
bonds
however
the
banks
shares
received
a
boost
after
an
eu
official
told
reuters
regulators
were
intensely
monitoring
italian
banks
liquidity
levels
but
there
was
no
cause
for
alarm
i
am
not
saying
italy
is
managing
the
situation
in
an
ideal
fashion
but
at
the
current
junction
i
don
t
think
they
are
anywhere
near
a
position
where
they
can
provoke
another
crisis
in
europe
owens
thomsen
said
politics
were
also
in
focus
in
britain
where
reports
of
progress
between
the
uk
and
the
eu
in
negotiating
a
brexit
deal
pushed
the
pound
to
highs
against
the
dollar
analysts
at
eurizon
slj
capital
said
parliamentary
approval
looked
likely
for
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
brexit
deal
the
times
newspaper
reported
opposition
labour
mps
would
back
the
agreement
already
significantly
undervalued
sterling
has
upside
risks
especially
against
the
euro
eurizon
slj
told
clients
arguing
that
was
fair
value
for
the
currency
the
dollar
was
flat
against
a
basket
of
currencies
easing
from
peaks
after
treasury
yields
retreated
that
allowed
emerging
currencies
hard
hit
in
recent
days
to
make
tentative
gains
the
imf
growth
forecast
cuts
weighed
on
oil
prices
pulling
them
off
highs
above
though
the
market
was
somewhat
supported
by
hurricane
michael
which
has
shut
nearly
