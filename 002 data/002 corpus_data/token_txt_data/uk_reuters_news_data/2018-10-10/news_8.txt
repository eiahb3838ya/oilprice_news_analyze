cash-strapped venezuela sets new wages for oil workers as protests simmer
caracas
reuters
venezuela
on
wednesday
increased
wages
for
workers
at
state
energy
company
pdvsa
after
employees
staged
small
protests
to
decry
meager
salaries
amid
the
opec
nation
s
economic
meltdown
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
in
august
unexpectedly
ordered
a
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
to
compensate
for
around
percent
annual
inflation
and
a
percent
devaluation
of
the
bolivar
currency
but
workers
at
pdvsa
said
their
wages
had
not
been
bumped
up
accordingly
and
that
the
company
had
instead
been
paying
bonuses
delcy
rodriguez
flanked
by
union
leaders
on
wednesday
announced
new
wages
but
did
not
provide
specific
figures
instead
praising
pdvsa
s
attitude
in
the
face
of
sanctions
to
the
pdvsa
workers
our
gratitude
because
they
have
been
a
fundamental
pillar
in
the
defense
of
the
oil
industry
against
attacks
from
imperialist
centers
of
power
said
rodriguez
a
key
maduro
ally
a
pdvsa
worker
and
two
former
employees
said
the
new
wages
remained
inadequate
and
would
not
halt
a
brain
drain
that
has
the
company
desperate
for
engineers
and
chemists
just
as
its
production
sinks
to
its
lowest
in
decades
according
to
an
unofficial
summary
of
the
new
salaries
circulated
by
pdvsa
workers
the
lowest
monthly
salary
is
now
bolivars
the
official
minimum
wage
or
just
a
month
the
highest
salary
for
executives
was
put
at
bolivars
a
whisker
above
a
month
pdvsa
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
information
about
the
salaries
thousands
of
oil
workers
are
fleeing
the
firm
under
the
watch
of
its
new
military
management
which
has
quickly
alienated
the
firm
s
embattled
upper
echelon
and
its
sources
have
told
reuters
those
who
remain
are
increasingly
unmotivated
irate
over
low
wages
and
fearful
of
work
accidents
as
pdvsa
s
installations
deteriorate
due
to
years
of
underinvestment
and
mismanagement
there
is
a
lot
of
anger
and
at
the
same
time
motivation
because
workers
have
woken
up
and
are
not
putting
up
with
this
anymore
one
refinery
worker
said
this
week
still
fears
of
dismissal
and
heavy
military
presence
at
pdvsa
have
kept
protests
in
check
in
venezuela
home
to
the
world
s
biggest
crude
reserves
