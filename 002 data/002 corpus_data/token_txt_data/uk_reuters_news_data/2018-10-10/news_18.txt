said
as
they
raised
the

for
the
number
injured
to
nine
firefighters
put
down
the
blaze
at
the

s
oil
and

shortly
after

and

jovicic
on
wednesday
of
the

jovicic
said
the
refinery
has
continued
to
operate
since
the
explosion
adding
that
an
investigation
which
was
still
underway
should
establish
the
cause
of
the
explosion
the
brod
refinery
which
processes
million
tonnes
of
crude
a
year
is
majority
owned
by
russia
s
neftegazinkor
a
unit
of
oil
company
zarubezhneft
auditors
have
previously
warned
that
it
may
face
liquidity
problems
after
it
piled
up
losses
and
its
liabilities
exceeded
assets
the
company
however
has
dismissed
those
claims
residents
of
nearby
slavonski
brod
just
across
the
border
in
croatia
have
complained
about
rising
pollution
levels
from
the
refinery
for
years
and
bosnian
and
croatian
authorities
have
been
working
to
combat
this
issue
air
quality
measures
showed
no
major
spike
in
pollution
levels
on
wednesday
jovicic
said
officials
from
croatia
and
russia
including
the
head
of
zarubezhneft
met
on
wednesday
in
slavonski
brod
to
talk
about
providing
gas
from
croatia
to
the
brod
refinery
in
an
effort
to
reduce
air
pollution
i
believe
that
by
the
end
of
we
could
have
the
brod
refinery
operating
on
gas
supply
from
croatia
at
the
moment
we
re
working
on
defining
commercial
terms
of
the
arrangement
