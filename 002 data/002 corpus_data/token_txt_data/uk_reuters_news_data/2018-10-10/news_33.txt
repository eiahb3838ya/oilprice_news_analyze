seattle
s
status
as
the
north
american
crane
capital
is
in
full
view
cranes
are
currently
reshaping
the
seattle
skyline
a
building
boom
that
reflects
this
city
s
phenomenal
growth
spurt
in
census
data
released
this
year
seattle
was
ranked
the
fastest
growing
big
city
over
the
last
decade
with
new
residents
pouring
in
to
take
jobs
at
companies
such
as
but
that
growth
is
a
worry
as
the
emerald
city
nicknamed
for
its
evergreen
trees
and
environmentalist
politics
strives
to
become
carbon
neutral
by
meaning
it
will
produce
no
more
emissions
than
it
can
offset
by
measures
such
as
planting
trees
a
building
boom
unlike
any
seen
since
the
late
century
yukon
gold
rush
is
making
an
already
challenging
goal
harder
experts
say
seattle
s
greenhouse
gas
emissions
have
fallen
percent
since
according
to
data
the
most
recently
available
from
the
city
s
office
of
sustainability
and
the
environment
over
the
same
period
the
city
s
population
grew
percent
we
have
decoupled
growth
from
emissions
the
city
s
chief
climate
official
jessica
finn
coven
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
but
nonetheless
we
re
not
on
track
to
meet
our
ambitious
goals
she
said
as
old
structures
fall
and
new
ones
are
built
heating
and
lighting
them
account
for
a
third
of
the
city
s
emissions
finn
coven
said
figuring
out
how
to
slash
emissions
further
without
either
scaring
off
economic
development
or
hampering
the
pace
of
housing
construction
is
a
challenge
she
admits
but
it
s
not
rocket
science
she
said
we
have
to
stop
heating
our
buildings
with
fossil
companies
leasing
office
space
in
the
bullitt
center
a
modern
edifice
eight
blocks
from
downtown
are
doing
their
part
to
help
seattle
become
carbon
neutral
the
bullitt
center
is
the
world
s
largest
living
building
one
that
produces
more
energy
than
it
consumes
thanks
to
an
design
that
exceeds
the
highest
standards
set
by
leed
a
green
building
ratings
system
windows
allow
ample
natural
light
during
working
hours
windows
open
and
close
automatically
to
adjust
the
temperature
and
an
heat
pump
takes
advantage
of
stable
temperatures
below
ground
to
heat
the
building
in
the
winter
and
cool
it
in
the
summer
a
cantilevered
roof
carpeted
in
photovoltaic
panels
captures
enough
solar
energy
in
this
cloudiest
of
major
cities
to
power
the
needs
of
an
engineering
firm
a
tech
company
satellite
office
and
a
home
contractor
among
others
occupants
of
the
building
say
it
s
comfortable
as
well
as
efficient
i
love
that
there
s
so
much
daylight
said
amanda
falkenhagen
a
lighting
designer
with
rushing
an
engineering
and
sustainability
consulting
firm
with
an
office
in
the
center
i
was
recently
in
a
traditional
office
building
and
it
made
me
realize
all
the
things
in
this
building
i
take
for
granted
the
lightness
airiness
connectedness
to
the
outside
she
said
denis
hayes
president
of
the
bullitt
foundation
an
environmental
philanthropy
serving
the
pacific
northwest
noted
that
often
in
the
center
there
are
no
lights
on
but
nobody
complains
the
foundation
invested
more
than
million
a
third
of
its
million
endowment
in
to
erect
the
bullitt
center
hoping
to
pave
the
way
for
other
similar
buildings
it
suddenly
takes
something
that
developers
thought
was
impossible
and
shows
that
it
s
in
fact
practical
hayes
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
the
center
s
airy
conference
room
the
problem
is
the
bullitt
center
still
remains
one
of
a
kind
despite
hayes
saying
that
if
it
was
still
the
biggest
living
building
in
the
world
five
years
after
being
commissioned
i
would
consider
our
efforts
a
failure
seattle
hopes
to
change
that
through
incentives
the
bullitt
center
for
instance
benefitted
from
a
pilot
initiative
that
waived
some
zoning
requirements
on
height
and
roof
design
in
order
to
accommodate
its
makeup
in
april
mayor
jenny
durkan
reauthorized
that
programme
and
launched
a
new
pilot
that
will
allow
up
to
buildings
to
be
built
higher
than
existing
rules
permit
if
they
meet
certain
energy
efficiency
standards
she
also
directed
the
utility
company
whose
electricity
comes
almost
entirely
from
hydropower
to
feed
excess
energy
created
by
buildings
such
as
the
bullitt
center
back
into
the
power
grid
and
pay
the
building
owners
for
creating
it
the
directive
which
allows
up
to
buildings
to
feed
power
into
seattle
s
electrical
grid
aims
to
provide
a
financial
incentive
for
building
owners
to
make
hefty
investments
in
energy
efficiency
seattle
also
has
put
in
place
one
of
the
united
states
strictest
codes
for
energy
efficiency
in
commercial
buildings
it
requires
most
new
buildings
to
achieve
an
energy
use
index
eui
rating
in
the
according
to
susan
wickwire
who
directs
the
seattle
district
an
initiative
to
encourage
real
estate
developers
and
building
managers
to
meet
tough
standards
the
average
seattle
building
has
a
rating
between
and
hayes
said
while
the
bullitt
center
s
is
wickwire
s
group
tracks
the
energy
performance
of
buildings
out
of
in
an
square
km
area
of
the
city
that
includes
downtown
seattle
she
thinks
the
incentive
programme
is
a
good
one
and
believes
real
estate
developers
and
property
managers
are
getting
on
board
with
greater
energy
efficency
there
is
a
shift
in
the
dna
of
the
city
to
move
away
from
fossil
fuels
to
greener
electricity
and
that
s
only
going
to
get
tighter
wickwire
said
but
the
overall
energy
efficiency
of
her
district
is
dragged
down
by
inefficient
buildings
constructed
in
the
and
she
said
owners
of
those
buildings
are
hesitant
to
pursue
retrofits
she
said
because
they
would
also
trigger
demands
for
other
upgrades
such
as
improved
access
for
the
disabled
and
better
ability
to
withstand
earthquakes
overcoming
that
problem
may
require
further
tweaks
to
city
government
policy
to
keep
seattle
on
target
with
its
climate
change
goals
those
goals
are
ones
activists
such
as
hayes
see
as
key
to
helping
set
similar
standards
nationwide
if
you
ca
do
it
in
seattle
i
do
know
how
you
can
do
it
in
cleveland
