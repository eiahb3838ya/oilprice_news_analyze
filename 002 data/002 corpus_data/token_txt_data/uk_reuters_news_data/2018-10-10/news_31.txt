norway
s
norsk
hydro
is
focused
on
a
return
to
full
output
at
its
alunorte
alumina
refinery
in
brazil
and
is
not
contemplating
layoffs
there
ceo
svein
richard
brandtzaeg
told
reuters
on
wednesday
hydro
had
said
last
week
it
would
close
down
the
world
s
largest
alumina
refinery
and
lay
off
workers
as
attempts
to
resolve
an
environmental
dispute
with
brazilian
authorities
faltered
this
week
it
announced
it
has
been
granted
permits
from
the
authorities
to
restart
operations
at
half
capacity
the
way
we
are
operating
now
requires
more
staffing
as
long
as
we
have
a
positive
dialogue
with
the
authorities
we
will
keep
the
staffing
we
believe
the
embargo
will
be
lifted
and
then
we
need
all
our
people
brandtzaeg
told
reuters
in
a
telephone
interview
hydro
was
ordered
by
brazilian
regulators
in
february
to
slash
output
by
half
at
the
refinery
after
the
company
admitted
making
unlicensed
emissions
of
untreated
water
during
severe
rains
it
s
difficult
to
give
exact
timeline
for
a
full
restart
but
we
are
now
in
the
process
of
implementing
measures
we
agreed
on
with
authorities
in
september
he
said
the
plant
has
an
annual
capacity
of
million
tonnes
of
alumina
or
percent
of
capacity
outside
china
alunorte
transforms
bauxite
into
alumina
which
is
turned
into
aluminium
at
huge
smelters
alumina
and
aluminium
prices
have
been
pushed
up
by
hydro
s
production
cut
at
alunorte
brandtzaeg
acknowledged
it
was
unfortunate
that
hydro
one
week
announced
plans
for
closure
and
the
next
week
plans
to
recover
output
we
want
stable
and
predictable
operations
but
in
this
case
it
was
not
possible
he
said
overall
demand
in
the
market
was
quite
good
driven
by
auto
industry
and
global
gdp
growth
brandtzaeg
said
repeating
hydro
s
forecast
for
an
aluminium
market
deficit
of
million
tonnes
this
year
there
s
still
a
lot
of
aluminium
in
storage
but
its
gradually
reducing
the
supply
deficit
is
covered
by
reserve
capacity
in
china
but
even
with
china
we
have
a
deficit
of
million
tonnes
globally
brandtzaeg
said
he
said
the
trade
war
between
china
and
so
far
had
little
impact
it
seems
consumers
have
to
pay
for
this
margins
for
exporters
seems
to
be
the
same
despite
a
tariff
increase
on
chinese
aluminium
