victory
to
the

s
farm

and
angering
oil

ahead
of

elections
trump
announced
the

long
trump
told
a
cheering
crowd
of
supporters
at
a
rally
in
council
bluffs
iowa
the
announcement
capped
a
effort
by
the
white
house
to
thread
the
needle
between
rival
corn
and
oil
industry
interests
by
boosting
ethanol
demand
while
also
cutting
costs
for
refiners
in
the
end
trump
is
moving
ahead
without
the
support
of
the
oil
refining
industry
which
wanted
more
in
return
for
agreeing
to
lift
the
summer
ban
the
move
is
also
aimed
at
helping
the
political
fortunes
of
republican
candidates
in
the
midwest
saddled
with
a
tough
farm
economy
and
the
imposition
of
import
tariffs
by
trump
and
china
polls
show
close
election
races
in
iowa
for
the
governor
s
seat
and
two
congressional
seats
trump
told
the
rally
that
democrats
would
end
ethanol
if
given
the
chance
you
d
better
get
out
there
and
vote
for
republicans
he
said
nancy
pelosi
the
top
democrat
in
the
house
of
representatives
said
in
a
statement
democrats
remain
vigilant
to
ensure
that
this
new
measure
will
create
real
benefits
for
america
s
iowa
is
the
nation
s
biggest
producer
of
corn
and
farmers
there
have
been
frustrated
with
falling
corn
and
soybean
prices
hurt
by
the
trade
war
between
the
united
states
and
china
it
s
about
time
said
warren
bachman
a
corn
and
soybean
farmer
in
iowa
with
all
the
trade
wars
tariffs
and
low
crop
prices
it
seems
like
we
are
taking
it
in
the
shorts
and
bearing
all
the
since
ethanol
is
cheaper
than
gasoline
the
administration
hopes
to
lower
pump
prices
which
currently
average
a
gallon
more
than
cents
higher
than
this
time
a
year
ago
according
to
the
american
automobile
association
the
environmental
protection
agency
prohibits
summer
sales
of
in
certain
areas
because
of
smog
concerns
for
the
ban
to
be
removed
it
must
draft
and
finalize
a
rule
in
the
spring
i
feel
certain
this
rule
can
be
accomplished
before
the
driving
season
next
year
secretary
of
agriculture
sonny
perdue
told
reuters
in
an
interview
biofuel
advocates
hope
the
lifting
of
the
ban
will
boost
ethanol
sales
geoff
cooper
chief
executive
of
the
renewable
fuels
association
trade
group
said
allowing
sales
could
double
sales
of
the
blend
from
roughly
million
gallons
currently
it
depends
on
how
quickly
new
pumps
would
be
added
the
greatest
impact
will
be
cooper
said
he
said
the
move
was
a
great
first
step
but
noted
it
faced
significant
political
and
legal
opposition
we
are
happy
but
we
know
there
s
still
a
long
road
ahead
cooper
said
the
rule
would
be
coupled
with
restrictions
on
the
biofuel
credit
trading
industry
sought
by
merchant
refiners
like
valero
energy
corp
and
pbf
energy
those
rules
will
seek
to
stop
parties
from
hoarding
the
credits
and
driving
up
the
cost
of
complying
with
biofuels
blending
laws
refiners
are
required
to
blend
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
fuel
pool
annually
or
buy
credits
from
competitors
who
do
refining
companies
that
buy
the
credits
have
complained
about
volatile
prices
the
epa
will
consider
forcing
blenders
retailers
and
trading
houses
to
sell
credits
more
quickly
to
reduce
market
volatility
a
white
house
official
said
but
that
is
not
enough
for
the
refiners
the
american
petroleum
institute
the
largest
oil
trade
association
opposes
lifting
the
ban
saying
gasoline
ruins
older
cars
and
potentially
voids
warranties
the
only
certainty
from
today
s
actions
is
a
lawsuit
chet
thompson
head
of
american
fuel
and
petrochemical
manufacturers
said
on
tuesday
he
said
the
industry
would
challenge
the
finalized
rule
in
court
saying
the
epa
had
acknowledged
it
lacks
the
authority
to
change
this
rule
last
year
biofuel
credit
prices
rose
to
nearly
each
near
a
high
as
merchant
refiners
warned
that
plants
may
be
forced
to
close
without
federal
action
prices
dropped
after
the
epa
expanded
its
use
of
waivers
freeing
small
refiners
from
their
obligations
the
credits
were
trading
at
roughly
cents
each
on
tuesday
