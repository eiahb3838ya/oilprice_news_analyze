el

conditions
are
developing
across
the
pacific
ocean
with
meteorologists
now
putting
the
probability
of
a
full
event
developing
by
the
end
of
the
year
at
almost
percent
sea
surface
temperatures
are
warming
across
much
of
the
equatorial
pacific
and
trade
winds
are
slackening
both
common
precursors
of
an
el
niño
episode
the
principal
impacts
of
el
niño
and
its
opposite
weather
pattern
la
niña
are
felt
in
southeast
asia
australia
and
south
america
where
it
can
have
a
major
effect
on
temperatures
and
rainfall
with
a
big
effect
on
agriculture
the
impacts
on
north
america
are
more
complicated
and
variable
but
it
has
an
effect
on
both
total
heating
demand
and
its
regional
distribution
in
the
winter
months
el

conditions
alter
the
position
of
the
polar
jet
stream
typically
bringing
warmer
temperatures
to
canada
and
the
northern
united
states
during
the
northern
hemisphere
winter
from
december
to
february
but
el
niño
also
results
in
a
stronger
and
more
persistent
pacific
jet
stream
into
the
southwestern
united
states
bringing
more
rain
snow
storms
and
cooler
temperatures
to
california
and
other
southern
states
as
the
ocean
warms
government
forecasters
in
the
united
states
and
australia
estimate
there
is
now
triple
the
normal
chance
of
el
niño
occurring
this
winter
though
it
is
likely
to
be
a
relatively
weak
episode
el
niño
is
one
aspect
of
the
enormous
circulations
that
transport
heat
across
the
equatorial
pacific
a
set
of
complex
interactions
known
formally
as
the
el
oscillation
enso
in
the
oceanic
circulation
cool
water
wells
up
from
the
deep
sea
off
the
coast
of
peru
and
is
transported
west
across
the
pacific
on
the
equatorial
current
towards
the
maritime
continent
of
southeast
asia
the
water
is
gradually
warmed
by
the
wind
and
sun
ultimately
forming
a
pool
of
very
warm
water
off
the
coast
of
indonesia
there
is
a
return
flow
of
warm
water
east
to
south
america
on
the
equatorial
counter
currents
and
in
a
deep
current
below
the
surface
of
the
ocean
closing
the
loop
at
the
same
time
warm
water
around
the
maritime
continent
causes
tremendous
evaporation
and
a
column
of
warm
moist
air
to
rise
high
into
the
atmosphere
which
then
flows
east
across
the
pacific
the
air
cools
and
dries
eventually
sinking
off
the
coast
of
south
america
before
returning
towards
asia
in
a
steady
westward
flow
near
the
surface
known
to
mariners
as
the
trade
winds
the
oceanic
and
atmospheric
circulations
tend
to
reinforce
one
another
with
the
trade
winds
driving
the
equatorial
currents
and
sea
surface
temperature
differentials
reinforcing
the
rising
and
falling
air
columns
but
the
strength
of
the
circulations
and
the
degree
of
coupling
between
them
varies
at
seasonal
annual
and
time
scales
el
nino
la
nina
and
the
southern
oscillation
philander
el
niño
occurs
when
both
circulations
are
weak
trade
winds
are
slack
less
cold
water
is
welling
up
off
the
coast
of
peru
and
less
cold
water
is
being
carried
west
into
the
central
pacific
la
niña
the
opposite
of
el
niño
occurs
when
circulations
are
at
their
strongest
with
strong
trade
winds
more
upwelling
and
more
cold
water
carried
further
into
the
central
ocean
the
entire
system
cycles
irregularly
between
weak
warm
el
niño
and
strong
cool
la
niña
phases
but
the
frequency
and
strength
of
the
phases
is
highly
variable
as
a
rule
however
el
niño
and
la
niña
effects
tend
to
be
weakest
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
year
strengthening
in
the
second
and
third
quarters
and
peaking
in
the
fourth
forecasts
therefore
tend
to
be
relatively
uncertain
and
subject
to
large
errors
early
in
the
year
but
become
more
accurate
towards
the
end
of
the
third
quarter
and
early
in
the
fourth
for
most
of
this
year
sea
surface
temperatures
in
the
pacific
have
been
warming
but
remained
close
to
their
seasonal
average
sending
a
relatively
ambiguous
signal
in
recent
weeks
however
sea
surface
temperatures
in
the
central
ocean
have
become
much
warmer
than
average
for
the
time
of
year
sending
a
clearer
sign
that
el
niño
might
be
developing
the
trade
winds
across
the
equatorial
pacific
have
also
been
weakening
which
should
promote
further
sea
surface
warming
in
the
weeks
ahead
and
intensify
the
formation
of
el

conditions
australia
s
bureau
of
meteorology
upgraded
its
previous
el
niño
watch
to
an
el
niño
alert
on
warning
that
el
niño
was
now
three
times
more
likely
than
normal
to
occur
before
the
end
of
the

the

part
of

national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
estimates
there
is
an
almost
percent
chance
of
el
niño
conditions
prevailing
between
december
and
february
el
niño
s
impact
is
felt
most
strongly
around
the
pacific
and
indian
oceans
and
becomes
fainter
further
away
where
the
effects
are
more
likely
to
be
masked
by
other
oceanic
and
atmospheric
developments
the
weather
impacts
also
depend
critically
on
the
strength
of
the

strong

very
strong

episodes
where
sea
surface
temperatures
are
degrees
or

centigrade
above
the

will
produce

and
readily
observable
impact
on
the

a

sea

just
degrees
centigrade
above
the
seasonal

much
less
impact
on

patterns
and
can
easily
be
masked
by
other
developments
the
strength
of
el

is
harder
to
forecast
accurately
but
episodes
that
develop
relatively
late
in
the
year
such
as
this
one
tend
to
be
weaker
than
those
which
start
to
develop
earlier
the
government
is
currently
forecasting
central
pacific
surface
temperatures
will
be
degrees
warmer
than
average
between
december
and
february
which
would
produce
