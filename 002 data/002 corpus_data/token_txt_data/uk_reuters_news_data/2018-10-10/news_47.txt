maersk
oil
trading
has
leased
oil
storage
space
in
singapore
signalling
a
push
by
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
ship
fuel
buyers
into
the
asian
bunkering
hub
ahead
of
changes
to
global
fuel
standards
from
trade
sources
said
maersk
oil
has
taken
storage
at
the
tankstore
oil
terminal
in
singapore
a
spokesman
for
parent
told
reuters
without
giving
further
details
the
firm
has
leased
cubic
meters
of
space
for
fuel
oil
for
six
months
said
three
trade
sources
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
matter
the
sources
declined
to
be
identified
as
they
are
not
authorised
to
speak
to
the
media
maersk
oil
is
a
major
ship
fuel
supplier
globally
but
has
not
had
its
own
storage
tanks
in
singapore
for
the
supply
of
marine
fuels
to
its
customers
which
include
the
world
s
biggest
container
line
the
move
comes
ahead
of
the
introduction
of
new
rules
on
marine
fuels
that
will
limit
the
sulphur
content
to
percent
from
percent
currently
to
curb
pollution
maersk
announced
in
august
a
deal
with
royal
vopak
an
independent
tank
storage
operator
to
launch
a
percent
sulphur
fuel
bunkering
facility
in
rotterdam
the
joint
initiative
will
meet
about
percent
of
maersk
s
global
demand
for
imo
compliant
fuels
and
we
are
looking
into
more
bunkering
facilities
like
this
lindegaard
head
of
maersk
oil
trading
told
reuters
last
month
the
singapore
storage
lease
comes
at
a
time
of
a
steeply
backwardated
market
structure
which
has
led
several
suppliers
not
to
renew
their
fuel
oil
storage
contracts
in
singapore
this
year
the
sources
said
storing
oil
products
is
difficult
in
a
backwardated
market
since
prompt
prices
are
higher
than
forward
prices
making
it
difficult
for
traders
to
recover
the
costs
of
storage
the
singapore
strait
is
one
of
the
world
s
busiest
shipping
superhighways
allowing
singapore
to
position
itself
as
the
world
s
largest
bunkering
hub
with
more
than
ships
calling
at
the
for
refuelling
each
year
