stamps
on
a
plastic
bottle
as
if
squashing
a
cockroach
then
using
the
heel
of
his
other
foot
flicks
the
bottle
cap
through
the
air
with
a
pop
he
is
not
showing
off
the
latest
street
dance
craze
in
douala
cameroon
s
commercial
capital
but
taking
part
in
one
of
the
country
s
biggest
plastic
recycling
schemes
striving
to
turn
waste
into
something
useful
while
cleaning
up
the
environment
behind
djabea
about
teenagers
gather
plastic
bottles
clogging
up
drainage
canals
and
gutters
while
others
go
door
to
door
asking
residents
for
their
plastic
rubbish
it
is
all
loaded
into
giant
tarpaulin
sacks
that
are
weighed
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
then
sent
to
be
remade
into
shoes
chairs
and
floor
tiles
among
other
products
the
initiative
led
by
brainchild
of
environmental
engineer
alain
rodrigue
ngonde
elong
operates
in
yaounde
too
collecting
to
tonnes
of
plastic
waste
per
year
roughly
the
weight
of
african
forest
elephants
elong
came
up
with
the
idea
as
a
student
in
douala
you
just
saw
the
rubbish
the
plastic
everywhere
you
looked
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
describing
open
drainage
channels
lining
the
streets
blocked
by
plastic
bottles
in
the
rainy
season
the
channels
overflowed
and
attracted
mosquitoes
which
bred
and
in
turn
increased
rates
of
malaria
and
dengue
fever
among
local
inhabitants
elong
said
no
one
had
a
solution
for
it
he
added
today
elong
s
team
works
on
the
problem
by
organising
a
rubbish
collection
campaign
every
quarter
employing
everyone
from
teenagers
eager
for
work
experience
to
street
children
needing
fast
cash
the
youngsters
earn
on
average
cfa
francs
per
month
though
their
income
varies
according
to
how
much
they
collect
and
the
amount
is
paid
by
the
city
council
in
recent
years
young
activists
and
entrepreneurs
across
west
and
central
africa
have
launched
a
host
of
creative
solutions
to
tackle
the
problem
of
discarded
plastic
in
cameroon
s
coastal
town
of
kribi
engineer
ismael
essome
builds
boats
from
plastic
bottles
for
fishing
and
in
lagos
nigeria
wecyclers
runs
a
trash
collection
and
recycling
business
providing
revenue
for
slum
residents
who
gather
rubbish
by
bicycle
and
are
paid
for
the
service
further
afield
in
south
africa
the
rethaka
foundation
transforms
waste
plastic
into
school
bags
fitted
with
a
portable
light
to
help
children
from
disadvantaged
backgrounds
do
their
homework
after
dark
meanwhile
in
towns
and
villages
across
africa
street
vendors
collect
plastic
bottles
and
refill
them
with
goods
to
sell
from
peanuts
and
oil
to
fresh
juice
and
even
petrol
yet
despite
growing
efforts
across
africa
to
reuse
plastic
much
of
the
waste
continues
to
blight
local
environments
as
litter
is
burned
or
buried
in
the
ground
around
the
world
researchers
estimate
that
about
million
tonnes
of
plastic
waste
leak
from
land
into
the
sea
each
year
in
cameroon
essome
s
plastic
boats
have
won
international
awards
and
recognition
making
waves
as
far
away
as
madrid
where
his
team
was
asked
to
construct
an
but
they
have
received
no
funding
from
governments
or
charities
that
would
allow
them
to
expand
their
venture
because
we
are
young
and
working
in
a
new
field
in
cameroon
it
s
a
big
challenge
said
essome
who
is
set
to
represent
his
country
at
the
one
young
world
summit
for
young
global
leaders
in
the
hague
this
month
founder
elong
said
obtaining
government
funding
was
a
slow
process
but
the
group
had
succeeded
in
securing
subsidies
from
several
local
authorities
as
well
as
income
from
businesses
that
buy
the
waste
to
make
plastic
products
yet
his
outfit
still
lacks
the
resources
to
collect
plastic
on
a
daily
basis
which
would
boost
results
elong
added
enterprises
like
his
also
have
a
mountain
to
climb
as
the
amount
of
plastic
waste
is
increasing
in
africa
was
estimated
to
have
million
metric
tonnes
of
mismanaged
plastic
waste
a
figure
that
could
rise
to
million
tonnes
in
if
nothing
is
done
scientists
warned
in
a
study
published
this
month
coupled
with
unprecedented
population
growth
ballooning
waste
is
likely
to
pose
major
problems
even
as
local
recycling
initiatives
multiply
environmental
activists
say
osric
tening
forton
an
environmental
risk
expert
with
the
african
development
bank
said
better
regulation
and
stronger
enforcement
of
existing
laws
are
needed
for
recycling
to
flourish
the
problem
is
not
exclusive
to
africa
the
organisation
for
economic
and
development
said
in
may
that
plastic
recycling
around
the
world
is
failing
to
reach
its
full
potential
it
called
for
the
introduction
of
higher
taxes
on
the
manufacture
and
use
of
new
plastics
and
more
mechanisms
to
make
consumers
pay
for
plastic
bags
cutlery
and
straws
another
major
challenge
is
changing
individual
behaviour
said
elong
some
people
tell
me
i
haven
t
eaten
for
two
days
why
should
i
care
about
recycling
plastics
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
response
he
explains
recycling
can
help
them
earn
money
to
improve
their
lives
while
also
benefiting
the
environment
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
need
to
make
people
understand
that
recycling
is
also
profitable
