governments must change tack to contain global warming, says big oil
london
reuters
governments
not
energy
firms
need
to
take
the
lead
in
achieve
targets
to
contain
global
warming
with
policies
that
will
change
fuel
and
other
energy
consumption
habits
oil
and
gas
companies
said
a
panel
called
this
week
for
unprecedented
changes
in
how
the
world
consumes
energy
and
a
dramatic
rise
in
the
use
of
renewable
power
to
contain
global
warming
at
lower
levels
and
protect
the
planet
from
heatwaves
floods
and
rising
sea
levels
clearly
it
s
a
call
to
action
bp
chief
executive
dudley
told
an
oil
money
conference
in
london
this
week
not
only
oil
and
gas
companies
but
you
need
that
in
agriculture
you
need
that
in
steel
production
you
need
that
in
the
use
of
people
pushing
the
button
on
the
wall
to
get
electricity
he
said
several
oil
and
gas
firms
are
among
those
taking
steps
to
contain
emissions
of
some
greenhouse
gases
royal
dutch
shell
bp
and
exxon
mobil
have
all
set
targets
to
reduce
methane
emissions
let
s
stop
quibbling
in
society
about
whose
fault
it
is
and
who
should
do
more
shell
chief
executive
ben
van
beurden
said
to
contain
the
rise
in
global
temperatures
at
degrees
celsius
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipc
said
manmade
global
net
carbon
dioxide
emissions
would
need
to
fall
by
about
percent
by
from
levels
it
said
emissions
should
be
net
zero
by
van
beurden
said
that
while
such
a
target
could
be
met
it
would
not
be
commercially
viable
under
today
s
regulations
and
policies
and
market
designs
so
things
would
have
to
bp
s
dudley
said
more
industry
collaboration
would
help
saying
cooperation
between
the
energy
industry
and
carmakers
was
helping
achieve
greater
fuel
efficiency
and
reducing
emissions
we
can
do
this
even
faster
and
more
efficiently
i
think
with
clearer
smarter
policy
signals
from
governments
he
said
governments
have
been
introducing
steps
to
reduce
emissions
including
promoting
the
use
of
electric
cars
phasing
out
sales
of
more
polluting
diesel
vehicles
and
encouraging
use
of
renewable
sources
of
energy
emissions
have
fallen
to
levels
last
seen
years
ago
as
it
uses
more
gas
which
produces
lower
emissions
than
other
fossil
fuels
such
as
oil
and
coal
britain
s
carbon
pricing
policy
has
cut
its
emissions
to
the
lowest
in
over
a
century
but
demand
for
oil
continues
to
climb
the
international
energy
agency
iea
estimates
global
oil
demand
will
hit
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
for
the
first
time
this
year
without
a
major
shift
in
policies
the
iea
expects
world
oil
demand
to
rise
for
at
least
the
next
years
heading
for
million
bpd
around
the
era
of
oil
is
far
in
fact
very
far
from
over
chief
executive
of
abu
dhabi
oil
company
adnoc
sultan
said
there
is
healthier
demand
for
our
product
which
is
undeniably
good
news
for
our
qatar
petroleum
ceo
saad
al
kaabi
said
it
was
too
much
to
expect
a
dramatic
reduction
in
the
use
of
oil
and
gas
given
demand
vehicle
fuel
and
petrochemicals
oil
is
not
going
to
completely
go
away
but
it
is
going
to
reduce
he
said
unless
you
give
me
a
solution
that
s
different
than
just
renewables
or
say
you
want
to
do
away
with
nuclear
power
also
and
so
on
unless
there
is
another
way
of
getting
there
it
s
difficult
to
comprehend
how
we
ll
achieve
it
