on
a
return

and
is
not
contemplating

there
ceo
svein
richard

told
reuters
on
wednesday
hydro
had
said
last
week
it
would
close
down
the
world
s
largest
alumina
refinery
and
lay
off
workers
as
attempts
to
resolve
an
environmental
dispute
with
brazilian
authorities
faltered
on
tuesday
it
announced
it
has
been
granted
permits
from
the
authorities
to
restart
operations
at
half
capacity
the
way
we
are
operating
now
requires
more
staffing
as
long
as
we
have
a
positive
dialogue
with
the
authorities
we
will
keep
the
staffing
we
believe
the
embargo
will
be
lifted
and
then
we
need
all
our
people
brandtzaeg
told
reuters
in
a
telephone
interview
it
s
difficult
to
give
exact
timeline
for
a
full
restart
but
we
are
now
in
the
process
of
implementing
measures
we
agreed
on
with
authorities
in
september
he
said
the
plant
has
an
annual
capacity
of
million
tonnes
of
alumina
or
percent
of
capacity
outside
china
alunorte
transforms
bauxite
into
alumina
which
is
turned
into
aluminium
at
huge
smelters
hydro
was
ordered
by
brazilian
regulators
in
february
to
slash
output
by
half
at
the
refinery
after
the
company
admitted
making
unlicensed
emissions
of
untreated
water
during
severe
rains
