traders say u.s. to be big winner of new imo shipping rules
london
reuters
the
united
states
is
set
to
be
the
big
winner
from
new
marine
fuel
rules
trading
house
gunvor
group
predicted
on
wednesday
while
rival
merchants
said
the
world
would
not
face
a
shortage
of
distillates
as
a
result
of
new
rules
to
cut
pollution
the
un
s
international
maritime
organisation
imo
has
set
new
rules
that
will
ban
ships
from
using
fuels
with
a
sulphur
content
above
percent
from
compared
with
percent
now
unless
they
are
equipped
with
scrubbers
to
clean
up
sulfur
emissions
the
industry
has
been
expecting
a
sharp
rise
in
demand
for
cleaner
distillates
mainly
diesel
at
the
expense
of
fuel
oil
that
would
become
largely
redundant
gunvor
group
chief
executive
torbjorn
tornqvist
said
at
the
oil
money
conference
in
london
that
the
switch
would
certainly
create
some
chaos
at
first
as
storage
and
logistics
must
deal
with
a
cocktail
of
fuel
blends
and
that
the
united
states
would
be
the
major
overall
winner
crude
differentials
will
reflect
the
strong
differentials
between
distillates
diesel
and
fuel
oil
we
will
see
the
price
of
heavy
crude
fall
and
light
sweet
rise
tornqvist
said
heavy
sour
crudes
yield
much
more
fuel
oil
than
light
sweet
oil
that
have
a
maximum
sulfur
content
of
percent
unless
a
refinery
has
advanced
equipment
the
big
winner
in
the
imo
is
actually
the
united
states
they
have
the
most
advanced
refining
system
in
the
world
and
will
take
advantage
of
importing
more
heavy
crude
oil
and
they
will
export
light
crude
oil
that
will
get
a
bigger
premium
he
said
vitol
chairman
ian
taylor
said
he
did
not
expect
a
major
glut
of
high
sulfur
fuel
oil
as
refiners
were
adding
units
so
many
units
have
been
prepared
to
reduce
it
and
there
s
so
little
high
sulfur
fuel
left
already
taylor
said
glencore
s
head
of
oil
alex
beard
echoed
the
remarks
as
scrubbers
units
to
ship
to
clean
out
pollutants
would
still
allow
ships
to
mop
up
some
fuel
oil
distillates
will
clearly
play
a
very
large
role
in
shipping
but
what
is
becoming
clear
is
that
the
world
can
cope
so
it
won
t
be
the
crisis
that
people
were
thinking
a
year
or
two
ago
he
said
our
estimate
is
that
by
january
something
like
percent
of
the
world
s
high
sulfur
fuel
demand
today
will
be
from
ships
that
have
scrubbers
and
that
will
grow
