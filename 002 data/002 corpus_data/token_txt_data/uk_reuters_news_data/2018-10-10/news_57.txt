plans
by
australia
s
agl
energy
to
start
importing
liquefied
natural
gas
from
will
be
delayed
after
the
state
of
victoria
called
for
the
company
and
its
pipeline
partner
to
submit
a
full
environmental
assessment
of
their
project
the
review
process
typically
takes
nine
to
months
which
means
agl
will
not
be
able
to
reach
a
final
investment
decision
on
the
a
million
million
jetty
project
by
june
as
it
had
hoped
agl
had
been
on
track
to
be
the
first
of
four
proposed
lng
import
projects
looking
to
fill
an
expected
gas
supply
shortfall
in
southeastern
australia
from
agl
declined
to
comment
on
wednesday
on
how
the
environmental
review
would
affect
the
project
s
timing
but
said
it
was
committed
to
working
with
the
community
and
following
all
state
and
regulatory
assessment
requirements
crib
point
will
be
a
safe
and
environmentally
responsible
project
making
gas
supply
for
victorians
more
secure
whilst
critically
bringing
much
needed
competition
to
place
downward
pressure
on
gas
prices
agl
general
manager
phaedra
deckart
who
is
leading
the
project
said
in
an
emailed
statement
the
state
s
move
follows
protests
in
the
community
around
the
western
port
location
where
agl
plans
to
build
a
jetty
to
park
a
ship
that
would
regasify
imported
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
and
hook
it
up
to
a
new
gas
pipeline
to
be
built
by
apa
group
while
this
project
has
great
potential
it
s
critical
we
assess
its
impacts
thoroughly
to
protect
the
community
and
the
environment
state
planning
minister
richard
wynne
said
in
a
statement
on
tuesday
the
state
s
labor
government
heading
to
an
election
in
november
has
yet
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
review
but
it
would
include
looking
at
the
impact
of
agl
s
floating
storage
and
regasification
unit
fsru
on
the
internationally
recognised
wetlands
area
around
the
proposed
jetty
we
re
encouraged
the
state
is
using
this
process
it
means
there
s
going
to
be
proper
scrutiny
of
the
project
said
nicholas
aberle
who
has
been
leading
a
campaign
against
the
project
for
green
group
environment
victoria
the
group
is
concerned
about
the
impact
on
sea
life
from
chlorinated
water
that
would
be
dumped
from
the
fsru
and
argues
that
australia
the
world
s
lng
exporter
should
not
need
to
import
gas
we
could
have
a
gas
reservation
policy
we
could
get
smarter
about
cutting
our
energy
waste
so
why
are
we
even
entertaining
the
idea
of
damaging
an
internationally
recognised
wetlands
