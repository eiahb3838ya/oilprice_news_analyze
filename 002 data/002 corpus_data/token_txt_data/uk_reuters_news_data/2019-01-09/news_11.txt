saudi
arabia
announced
a
slight
rise
in
its
crude
oil
reserves
on
wednesday
after
they
were
independently
audited
providing
more
detail
about
the
size
of
deposits
shrouded
in
secrecy
for
decades
saudi
arabia
s
reserves
of
easily
recoverable
oil
have
long
been
the
world
s
largest
but
few
details
were
public
the
external
audit
was
started
as
part
of
preparations
for
the
initial
public
offering
of
state
oil
company
saudi
aramco
the
saudi
energy
ministry
said
in
a
statement
carried
by
state
news
agency
spa
that
saudi
arabia
s
proven
oil
and
gas
reserves
stood
at
around
billion
barrels
of
oil
and
trillion
standard
cubic
feet
of
gas
as
of
the
end
of
the
results
point
out
that
the
kingdom
s
reserves
of
oil
and
gas
are
bigger
than
what
we
have
been
announcing
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
told
a
news
conference
in
riyadh
the
audit
will
dispel
scepticism
in
the
oil
industry
about
the
size
of
saudi
reserves
and
provide
assurance
for
potential
investors
in
aramco
investors
should
the
initial
public
offering
which
has
been
delayed
eventually
go
ahead
falih
s
news
conference
took
place
hours
later
than
initially
scheduled
and
spa
corrected
its
initial
announcement
of
the
reserves
figures
the
figure
for
crude
reserves
is
larger
than
the
total
billion
barrels
aramco
reported
in
its
annual
review
this
certification
underscores
why
every
barrel
we
produce
is
the
most
profitable
in
the
world
and
why
we
believe
saudi
aramco
is
the
world
s
most
valuable
company
falih
said
in
the
statement
aramco
s
cost
of
production
is
a
mere
a
barrel
he
said
giving
a
rare
insight
into
a
key
metric
not
usually
disclosed
industry
experts
say
it
can
cost
between
to
to
produce
a

oil
saudi
arabia
confirmed
for
the
first
time
that
consultants
degolyer
and
macnaughton
carried
out
the
audit
the

evaluated
major
oil
reservoirs
operated
by
aramco
out
of
in
its
portfolio
in
degolyer
s
view
these
contained
billion
barrels
of
proved
oil
reserves
compared
to
billion
as
estimated
internally
by
aramco
for
almost
years
despite
rising
production
large
swings
in
oil
prices
and
improved
technology
riyadh
had
annually
reported
the
same
number
for
reserves
at
around
billion
barrels
according
to
a
statistical
review
by
bp
plans
for
the
aramco
ipo
were
shelved
last
year
for
the
forseeable
future
