reported
on

that

is
increasingly
eager
to
strike
a

soon
in
an
effort
to
perk
up

when
federal

chairman
jerome
powell
said
he
was
aware
of
risks
to
the
economy
and
would
be
patient
and
flexible
in
policy
decisions
this
year
markets
are
scaling

of

extreme
nervousness

powell
effectively
did
some
easing
with
his
words

traders
are
looking
to
trump
s
televised
address
at

wednesday
where
he
is
expected
to
make
his
case
that
a
border
wall
is
urgently
needed
despite
opposition
from
democrats
that
suggests
the
dispute
on
the
issue
which
has
sparked
a
government
shutdown
since
late
december
is
nowhere
near
a
resolution
trump
has
considered
declaring
the
border
situation
a
national
emergency
which
could
enable
him
to
bypass
congress
mandate
to
approve
federal
spending
and
to
build
the
wall
without
its
approval
such
a
step
however
would
likely
face
an
immediate
legal
challenge
and
could
lead
to
further
polarisation
in
the
political
environment
