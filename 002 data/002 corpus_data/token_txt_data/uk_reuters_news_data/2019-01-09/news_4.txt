the

china
in
fell
by
around
percent
from
the
prior
year
as
the
trade
war
between
beijing
and
washington
heated
up
in
recent
weeks
however
that
dispute
has
cooled
somewhat
with
talks
in
china
this
week
between
chinese
and
trade
teams
raising
hopes
additional
tariffs
can
be
avoided
as
the
trade
war
escalated
during
the
last
six
months
of
only
six
lng
vessels
went
from
the
united
states
to
china

during
the
same
period

tariffs
on
lng
in
september
that
happened
even
though
chinese
lng
purchases
last
year
reached
highs
and
the
united
states
sold
record
amounts
of
the
fuel
china
the
fastest
growing
consumer
of
the
fuel
became
the
world
s
second
biggest
lng
buyer
in
as
the
government
weans
the
country
off
dirty
coal
to
reduce
pollution
the
united
states
meanwhile
is
on
track
to
become
the
world
s
third
biggest
lng
exporter
by
capacity

in
mostly
during
the
first
half
of
the
year

companies
proposing
new
lng
export
terminals
expressed
optimism
a
new
trade
agreement
could
help
advance
their
projects
the
lng
export
industry
has
been
particularly
vulnerable
to
the
trade
war
mike
sommers
head
of
the
american
petroleum
institute
industry
group
said
on
tuesday
adding
that
he
hopes
negotiators
will
soon
resolve
the
dispute
china
imported
about
million
of
lng
from
the
united
states
in
about
percent
of
the
lng
the
shipped
that
year
making
it
the
third
biggest
buyer
of
the
fuel
from
the
united
states
prior
to
the
slowdown
china
was
on
track
to
import
billion
cubic
feet
bcf
of
lng
in
up
from
bcf
in
and
bcf
in
it
imported
no
lng
from
the
united
states
in
one
billion
cubic
feet
of
gas
is
enough
to
fuel
about
million
homes
for
a
day
china
likely
bought
less
than
bcf
of
lng
in
to
be
sure
some
of
the
handful
of
vessels
that
left
the
united
states
in
december
are
still
sailing
across
the
pacific
and
could
stop
in
china
in
addition
to
the
trade
war
lng
analysts
noted
the
slowdown
in
vessels
going
to
china
last
year
was
also
due
to
milder
winter
weather
and
an
increase
in
exports
from
australia
and
other
lng
exporting
countries
closer
to
china
