china
three
gorges
corp
ctgc
operator
of
the
world
s
largest
hydropower
plant
is
turning
to
projects
offshore
a
senior
official
said
as
domestic
costs
soar
and
space
runs
out
on
the
country
s
crowded
rivers
we
don
t
have
any
plans
to
build
more
hydropower
projects
in
china
but
will
develop
more
projects
overseas
said
sun
zhiyu
the
company
s
on
the
sidelines
of
a
meeting
on
tuesday
we
already
have
business
in
more
than
countries
and
will
focus
mostly
on
south
asia
southeast
asia
africa
and
latin
america
he
added
the
gw
three
gorges
project
on
the
yangtze
river
was
completed
in
after
a
boom
throughout
china
its
turbines
generate
billion
of
electricity
per
year
ctgc
parent
of
listed
china
yangtze
power
corp
has
since
completed
other
giant
dams
on
the
yangtze
upstream
and
its
total
hydropower
generation
capacity
including
projects
under
construction
stands
at
nearly
gw
more
than
the
total
power
capacity
of
australia
china
s
total
hydropower
capacity
hit
gw
last
year
accounting
for
a
fifth
of
total
generation
but
its
reliance
on
large
and
disruptive
dam
projects
has
been
controversial
advocacy
groups
claim
capacity
could
safely
be
doubled
but
the
government
has
slowed
down
hydro
approvals
amid
concerns
about
its
devastating
impact
on
communities
and
ecosystems
while
hydropower
produces
no
emissions
during
generation
opponents
say
it
contributes
to
global
warming
by
submerging
forest
and
plant
life
under
water
giant
dams
and
reservoirs
also
cause
biodiversity
loss
and
put
regions
like
sichuan
under
greater
seismic
pressure
worried
about
potential
unrest
china
has
sought
to
improve
the
way
hydropower
migrants
are
compensated
payments
to
displaced
residents
now
account
for
half
of
a
project
s
total
costs
and
tougher
rules
are
set
to
be
implemented
next
year
china
has
also
cracked
down
on
small
hydropower
said
to
have
caused
untold
damage
to
aquatic
ecosystems
throughout
the
country
however
industry
advocates
said
at
an
industry
meeting
in
beijing
on
tuesday
that
hydropower
must
still
play
a
vital
role
in
china
s
clean
energy
goals
wang

center
a
cabinet
think
tank
said
new
rules
had
raised
costs
and
eroded
investment
incentives
and
transmission
capacity
was
also
insufficient
fake
environment
protection
ideas
and
ignorant
ecological
views
are
flooding
society
and
demonising
hydroelectric
projects
which
will
mislead
national
policies
national
security
and
ecological
protection
