the
dutch
high
court
said
on
wednesday
it
would
consider
demands
on
seeking
an
immediate
end
to
gas
production
from
the
groningen
field
after
the
government
said
it
would
cut
output
gradually
the
government
has
capped
groningen
production
at
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
in
the
year
starting
october
and
said
it
would
reduce
output
to
zero
in
the
coming
decade
the
high
court
said
it
had
received
objections
to
the
plan
ranging
from
civilians
to
local
and
regional
authorities
expressing
concerns
about
seismic
risks
caused
by
drilling
and
demanding
that
production
is
stopped
at
once
two
of
the
objections
would
be
heard
this
month
and
the
rest
were
expected
to
be
dealt
with
in
april
the
court
said
adding
that
it
would
take
several
weeks
to
reach
a
verdict
after
the
hearing
the
petitioners
in
the
january
hearing
have
demanded
an
immediate
production
halt
at
least
until
the
court
has
made
a
final
decision
on
the
production
plan
analysts
say
the
court
was
unlikely
to
grant
an
immediate
halt
in
output
because
the
netherlands
still
depends
on
groningen
gas
for
a
significant
part
of
its
energy
supply
years
of
gas
extraction
have
led
to
a
string
of
minor
earthquakes
in
the
groningen
region
damaging
thousands
of
houses
and
buildings
in
the
northern
dutch
province
the
government
said
last
year
that
production
would
end
completely
by
after
already
being
cut
by
more
than
percent
since
its
peak
