u.s. oil exports to asia set to rise in q2 as freight costs fall

reuters
crude
oil
exports
to
asia
are
set
to
rise
in
the
second
quarter
as
sellers
cut
prices
following
sharp
drops
in
freight
rates
and
expected
weaker
demand
in
the
united
states
trading
and
shipping
sources
said
offers
for
crude
arriving
in
asia
in
the
of
march
or
april
are
about
cents
a
barrel
lower
than
a
month
earlier
they
said
making
it
more
competitive
against
oil
from
the
middle
east
crude
grades
popular
with
asian
buyers
include
light
oils
such
as
west
texas
intermediate
wti
midland
and
eagle
ford
as
well
as
mars
and
southern
green
canyon
among
heavier
grades
the
united
states
has
boosted
crude
sales
to
asia
helped
by
a
steep
discount
for
oil
to
the
global
benchmark
brent
there
is
the
potential
for
crude
exports
to
asia
to
be
higher
if
the
spread
remains
in
the
range
it
has
in
recent
months
and
with
the
lower
freight
rates

there
are
a
few
variables
though
with
the
ongoing
trade
war
and
the
potential
for
the
waivers
for
iranian
crude
exports
to
asian
countries
to
not
be
a
decision
not
to
extend
waivers
allowing
some
asian
countries
to
import
iranian
oil
despite
sanctions
would
boost
demand
from
south
korea
taiwan
japan
china
and
india
the
rate
for
chartering
a
very
large
crude
carrier
to
ship
million
barrels
of
oil
from
the
louisiana

fallen

enquiries
for

and
vitol
while

said
one
source
more
crude
could
also
be
freed
up
for
exports
as

prepare
to
shut

from

crude
has
become
cheaper
than
oman
on

they
said
the
price
cuts
have
also
depressed
spot
prices
for

such
as
murban

oman
the

said
while
demand
from
big

south

to
remain
