andrade
was
charged
in
brazil
for
acting
as
a
middleman
between
top
executives
at
vitol
allegedly
funneling
bribes
to
petrobras
officials
in
exchange
for
sweetheart
deals
from
the
firm
officials
allege
that
he
also
carried
out
the
same
services
for
glencore
and
other
big
oil
trading
firms
to
win
sweetheart
contracts
with
petrobras
two
former
executives
of
trafigura
were
charged
in
the
same
scheme
on
the
cases
are
the
latest
part
of
brazil
s
car
wash
investigation
launched
in
to
investigate
contracting
graft
at
petrobras
the
probe
and
resulting
trials
have
toppled
scores
of
powerful
business
and
political
figures
including
construction
industry
moguls
and
former
presidents
of
brazil
and
peru
brazilian
prosecutors
have
said
they
will
pressure
the
middlemen
charged
and
arrested
to
turn
state
s
witness
and
testify
against
powerful
executives
at
the
oil
trading
firms
the
same
method
they
have
used
for
years
to
take
down
top
targets
prosecutors
alleged
in
their
charges
against
andrade
that
vitol
s
head
of
operations
mike
loya
and
its
latin
american
and
caribbean
boss
antonio
maarraoui
had
full
knowledge
of
the
scheme
neither
loya
nor
maarraoui
has
been
charged
neither
of
the
executives
has
replied
to
repeated
requests
for
comment
prosecutors
said
at
least
million
in
bribes
were
involved
in
the
cases
involving
the
oil
traders
and
have
called
their
discoveries
so
far
the
tip
of
the
a
vitol
spokeswoman
declined
to
comment
on
tuesday
but
said
the
company
would
always
cooperate
with
investigators
a
glencore
spokesman
said
the
firm
took
ethics
and
compliance
seriously
but
could
not
comment
further
he
added
that
glencore
would
cooperate
with
brazilian
authorities
the
stakes
are
high
for
both
trading
firms
brazilian
prosecutors
allege
some
of
the
crimes
were
carried
out
by
petrobras
traders
based
in
houston
and
that
some
illicit
funds
moved
through
the
and
european
banking
systems
raising
the
chance
that
jurisdiction
for
investigating
the
case
could
widen
brazilian
and
prosecutors
have
worked
closely
in
the
past
on
car
wash
cases
the
probe
has
already
frozen
current
business
for
the
trading
firms
in
brazil
an
increasingly
important
global
oil
producer
but
not
yet
a
major
source
of
revenue
for
the
firms
trafigura
said
its
turnover
in
brazil
last
year
was
million
a
fraction
of
its
overall
revenue
of
billion
in
glencore
and
vitol
would
not
provide
revenue
details
but
said
brazil
was
a
minor
market
vitol
has
a
deal
pending
to
purchase
a
stake
in
petrobras
prized
nigerian
oilfields
petrobras
has
said
there
are
no
indications
of
wrongdoing
in
that
deal
but
it
would
be
up
to
brazilian
regulators
to
make
the
final
determination
