china
s
maritime
authority
has
banned
the
discharge
of
wash
water
used
in
ships
to
strip
hazardous
sulfur
emissions
from
engine
exhaust
gases
from
in
an
effort
to
curb
pollution
of
its
coastal
seas
the
ban
on
discharges
from
scrubbers
affects
all
rivers
and
ports
along
china
s
coastline
and
includes
the
bohai
sea
according
to
an
official
from
the
china
s
maritime
safety
administration
msa
the
measure
mirrors
a
similar
move
made
in
singapore
ahead
of
international
maritime
organization
imo
rules
that
will
ban
ships
from
using
marine
fuels
with
a
sulfur
content
of
more
than
percent
from
unless
they
are
equipped
with
exhaust
scrubbers
to
clean
up
sulfur
emissions
we
adopted
the
ban
in
designated
regions
mainly
out
of
consideration
to
protect
the
environment
and
prevent
sulfur
content
pollution
in
more
acidic
waters
said
the
official
the
ban
however
will
not
be
extended
to
all
of
china
s
territorial
waters
because
of
the
increased
costs
for
the
shipping
industry
said
the
official
china
imposed
tighter
rules
from
the
start
of
on
sulfur
and
nitrogen
oxide
emissions
from
vessels
in
coastal
areas
hainan
waters
and
inland
yangtze
and
xijiang
river
areas
according
to
the
ministry
of
transport
the
wash
water
ban
also
took
effect
on
the
first
day
of
msa
said
ship
operators
are
also
not
allowed
to
discharge
any
residue
from
wash
water
or
burn
it
on
the
ships
it
said
the
bans
will
limit
the
use
of
scrubbers
and
therefore
fuel
oil
in
china
suggesting
a
strong
uptick
in
diesel
demand

aspects
in
an
email
alert
to
clients
on
tuesday
to
comply
with
the
ban
on
wash
water
discharge
in
designated
waters
shippers
will
have
to
switch
to
a
scrubber
system
or
to
bunker
fuels
such
as
gasoil
or
diesel
and
fuel
oil
scrubbers
use
seawater
to
capture
sulfur
from
engine
exhausts
before
discharging
this
wash
water
back
into
the
ocean
after
treatment
in
systems
scrubbing
is
performed
using
water
treated
with
additives
recycling
the
liquid
internally
hybrid
scrubbers
are
a
combination
of
both
china
s
effective
ban
on
scrubbers
is
similar
to
action
singapore
took
in
november
to
outlaw
the
discharge
of
wash
water
in
port
waters
there
from
singapore
is
the
world
s
biggest
hub
for
ship
refueling
or
bunkering
some
chinese
port
cities
are
also
increasingly
targeting
the
dollar
bunkering
industry
taking
steps
to
show
that
they
will
be
ready
to
meet
the
new
imo
fuel
standards
