founded
in
carbon
engineering
developed
technology
that
captures
carbon

directly
from
the

and
converts
it
into
fuels
for
transport
and
for
use
in
enhanced
oil
recovery
the
firm
has
been
removing
from
the
atmosphere
since
at
a
pilot
plant
in
british
columbia
and
converting
it
into
fuel
since
carbon
engineering
expects
to
reach
its
financing
target
of
million
by
the

on
track
to

with
an
increasing
focus
worldwide
on
the
need
for
aggressive
emissions
reductions
ce
s
technology
can
play
a
major

energy
industry
leaders
like
occidental
and
chevron
will
greatly
accelerate
commercialization
of
ce

added
extracting
vast
amounts
of
carbon

from
the

could
help
to
limit
global
warming
blamed
for
causing
more
heatwaves
wildfires
floods
and
rising
sea
levels
the
costs
of
such
technologies
are
high
however
and
a
huge
number

would
be
needed
to
make
a
dent
in
manmade
emissions
