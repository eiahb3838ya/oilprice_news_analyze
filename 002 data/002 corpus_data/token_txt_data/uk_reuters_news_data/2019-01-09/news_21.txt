iran
will
continue
with
its
aerospace
programme
despite
warnings
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
said
on
wednesday
adding
there
was
no
international
law
prohibiting
such
a
programme
zarif
who
is
in
new
delhi
on
a
bilateral
visit
also
told
reuters
that
leaving
a
nuclear
deal
agreed
with
world
powers
is
an
option
available
with
tehran
but
is
not
the
only
option
on
the
table
the
united
states
earlier
this
month
issued
a
warning
to
iran
against
pursuing
three
planned
space
rocket
launches
that
it
said
would
violate
a
security
council
resolution
because
they
use
ballistic
missile
technology
under
the
security
council
resolution
which
enshrined
the
nuclear
deal
in
iran
is
called
upon
to
refrain
from
work
on
ballistic
missiles
designed
to
deliver
nuclear
weapons
for
up
to
eight
years
iran
has
ruled
out
negotiations
with
washington
over
its
military
capabilities
particularly
the
missile
programme
run
by
the
revolutionary
guards
it
says
the
programme
is
purely
defensive
and
denies
missiles
are
capable
of
being
tipped
with
nuclear
warheads
president
donald
trump
pulled
out
of
an
international
agreement
on
iran
s
nuclear
programme
in
may
and
reimposed
sanctions
on
tehran
he
said
the
deal
was
flawed
because
it
did
not
include
curbs
on
iran
s
development
of
ballistic
missiles
or
its
support
for
proxies
in
syria
yemen
lebanon
and
iraq
