u.s. house democrats to test republicans on trumpâ€™s wall demand
washington
jan
reuters
as
a
partial
government
shutdown
neared
the
mark
democrats
on
wednesday
were
set
to
test
republicans
resolve
in
backing
president
donald
trump
s
drive
to
build
a
wall
on
the
border
with
mexico
which
has
sparked
an
impasse
over
agency
funding
house
of
representatives
speaker
nancy
pelosi
and
her
fellow
democrats
who
took
control
of
the
chamber
last
week
plan
to
advance
a
bill
to
immediately
reopen
the
treasury
department
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
several
other
agencies
that
have
been
in
partial
shutdown
mode
since
democrats
are
eager
to
force
republicans
to
choose
between
funding
the
treasury
s
internal
revenue
service
at
a
time
when
it
should
be
gearing
up
to
issue
tax
refunds
to
millions
of
americans
and
voting
to
keep
it
partially
shuttered
in
a
countermove
the
trump
administration
said
on
tuesday
that
even
without
a
new
shot
of
funding
the
irs
would
somehow
make
sure
those
refund
checks
get
sent
but
it
was
the
republican
president
s
insistence
on
a
massive
barrier
on
the
border
that
dominated
the
washington
debate
and
sparked
a
political
blame
game
in
a
nationally
televised
address
on
tuesday
night
trump
asked
how
much
more
american
blood
must
be
shed
before
congress
does
its
job
referring
to
murders
he
said
were
committed
by
illegal
immigrants
senate
democratic
leader
chuck
schumer
responding
to
trump
said
he
and
the
president
both
wanted
stronger
border
security
but
disagreed
over
the
most
effective
approach
most
presidents
have
used
white
house
oval
office
addresses
for
noble
purposes
this
president
just
used
the
backdrop
of
the
oval
office
to
manufacture
a
crisis
stoke
fear
and
divert
attention
from
the
turmoil
in
his
administration
schumer
said
later
this
week
pelosi
will
force
votes
that
one
by
one
provide
the
money
to
operate
departments
ranging
from
homeland
security
and
justice
to
state
agriculture
commerce
and
labor
by
using
a
democratic
majority
to
ram
those
bills
through
the
house
pelosi
is
hoping
enough
senate
republicans
back
her
up
and
abandon
trump
s
wall
gambit
the
political
maneuvering
comes
amid
a
rising
public
backlash
over
the
suspension
of
some
government
activities
that
has
resulted
in
the
layoffs
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
federal
workers
other
essential
employees
are
being
required
to
report
to
work
but
without
pay
for
the
time
being
with
tempers
running
high
over
trump
s
demand
for
billion
just
for
this
year
to
fund
wall
construction
there
are
doubts
pelosi
s
plan
will
succeed
in
forcing
the
senate
to
act
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
a
republican
has
not
budged
from
his
hard
line
of
refusing
to
bring
up
any
government
funding
bill
that
does
not
have
trump
s
backing
the
funding
fight
stems
from
congress
inability
to
complete
work
by
a
deadline
on
funding
all
government
agencies
it
did
manage
however
to
appropriate
money
for
about
percent
of
the
government
by
that
deadline
mainly
military
and
programs
as
house
democrats
plow
ahead
trump
and
vice
president
mike
pence
will
go
to
capitol
hill
on
wednesday
to
attend
a
weekly
closed
lunch
meeting
of
senate
republicans
they
are
expected
to
urge
them
to
hold
firm
on
his
wall
demands
even
as
some
are
publicly
warning
their
patience
is
wearing
thin
later
in
the
day
trump
is
scheduled
to
host
bipartisan
congressional
leaders
to
see
if
they
can
break
the
deadlock
on
thursday
trump
travels
to
the
border
to
highlight
an
immigration
crisis
that
his
base
of
conservative
supporters
wants
him
to
address
but
so
far
there
have
been
few
signs
that
either
trump
or
his
democratic
opponents
in
congress
are
moving
toward
a
deal
