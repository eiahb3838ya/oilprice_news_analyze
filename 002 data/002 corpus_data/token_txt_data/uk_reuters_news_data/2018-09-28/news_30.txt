forced
members

clearing
operation
to
help
fill
the
gap
including
banks
which
process
trades
for
customers
the
default
brought
a
new
situation
it
is
natural
the
costs
for
the
clients
will
have
to
be
adjusted
said
one
of
the
sources
who
is
the
head
of
clearing
operations
at
a
european

our
cost
has
to
be
covered
and
fees
will
rise
depending
on
each
customer
s
individual
this

said
the
bank
would
raise
fees
for
customers
within
days
or
weeks

soon
raise

a
small

sources
spoke
on
condition

they
were
considering
raising
their
fees
we
will
have
a
discussion
with
the
members
clearing
through
us
and
nasdaq
one
possible
outcome
after
assessing
the
risk
could
be
raising
the
cost
of
clearing
fees
said
seb
spokesman
frank
hojem
seb
will
take
into
account
risks
of
credit
losses
as
well
as
regular
running
costs
in
pricing
its
clearing
services
hojem
said
we
are
considering
our
options
there
are
several
options
on
the
table
we
will
communicate
our
decision
when
we
are
ready
abn
amro
spokesman

citigroup

goldman
sachs
and
societe
generale
declined
to
comment
some
power

they
would
now
consider
using

help
protect
against
risk

head
of

optimization
at
germany
energy
firm
said
we
already
clear
through
a
bank
we
were
not
directly
impacted
on
that
the
default
but
you
can
anticipate
that
there
will
be
indirect
consequences
for
us
further
down
the
she
said
an
increase
in
banks
clearing
fees
was
not
surprising
obviously
we
would
have
to
look
at
increased
bank
fees
could
trigger
chain
reactions
and
change
the
market
said
tor
mosegaard
head
of
power
markets
for
danske
commodities
which
has
already
started
to
reduce
its
position
on
the
nordic
power
exchange
if
our
bank
raised
fees
substantially
we
will
consider
closing
our
links
to
that
bank
i
will
negotiate
with
other
banks
