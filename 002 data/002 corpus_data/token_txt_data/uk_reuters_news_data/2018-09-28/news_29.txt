berlin
reuters
the
german
government
is
on
track
to
find
a
solution
for
tackling
pollution
from
diesel
vehicles
but
there
is
no
agreement
yet
a
government
source
said
after
chancellor
angela
merkel
chaired
a
meeting
on
friday
in
berlin
final
details
of
a
deal
that
seeks
to
avert
bans
on
older
vehicles
from
city
streets
should
be
hammered
out
when
leaders
of
merkel
s
coalition
of
conservatives
and
social
democrats
meet
on
monday
we
re
on
a
good
track
the
source
told
reuters
there
are
only
details
that
need
to
be
cleared
merkel
has
set
an
deadline
to
find
a
way
to
tackle
pollution
from
diesel
vehicles
and
avert
more
driving
bans
in
cities
that
are
being
forced
by
courts
to
take
action
to
improve
air
quality
yet
her
government
has
been
split
on
how
best
to
tackle
the
problem
with
transport
minister
andreas
scheuer
siding
with
carmakers
in
calling
for
incentives
to
encourage
owners
of
older
models
to
trade
them
in
for
newer
cleaner
ones
environment
minister
svenja
schulze
has
meanwhile
called
for
hardware
retrofits
on
older
models
an
option
that
the
industry
says
is
only
feasible
in
some
cases
but
which
would
hit
fuel
consumption
and
performance
in
others
we
significantly
narrowed
our
differences
at
today
s
meeting
said
deputy
environment
minister
florian
pronold
standing
by
his
ministry
s
call
for
retrofits
and
saying
they
should
be
paid
for
by
manufacturers
volkswagen
daimler
and
bmw
could
offer
owners
of
older
vehicles
that
meet
the
euro
emissions
standard
as
well
as
owners
of
some
euro
standard
models
to
trade
in
their
cars
for
new
ones
sources
said
before
the
meeting
scheuer
also
speaking
before
the
talks
told
broadcaster
that
he
would
propose
such
incentives
saying
the
most
effective
way
to
reduce
air
pollution
was
to
renew
the
fleet
of
cars
plying
germany
s
city
streets
any
solution
is
likely
to
cost
several
billion
euros
scheuer
said
this
week
that
car
owners
and
taxpayers
should
not
foot
the
bill
in
separate
comments
on
friday
he
said
he
supported
hardware
upgrades
for
around
commercial
vehicles
telling
the
redaktionsnetzwerk
deutschland
newspaper
group
they
could
be
funded
from
an
existing
program
earlier
on
friday
the
faz
newspaper
reported
that
carmakers
may
offer
owners
of
vehicles
affected
by
driving
bans
vouchers
for
hardware
upgrades
by
suppliers
such
as
baumot
or
hjs
without
citing
sources
faz
said
the
scheme
would
apply
to
some
euro
diesel
vehicles
and
would
cover
percent
of
the
cost
of
upgrades
up
to
a
maximum
level
of
euros
per
vehicle
older
vehicles
meeting
the
euro
standard
would
not
be
covered
but
their
owners
would
be
offered
incentives
to
swap
their
vehicles
for
new
ones
it
said
daimler
volkswagen
and
bmw
