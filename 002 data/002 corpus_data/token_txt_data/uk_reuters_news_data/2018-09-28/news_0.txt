reuters
california
regulators
on
friday
voted
to
require
that
automakers
stick
with
federal
vehicle
emissions
standards
for
cars
sold
in
the
state
regardless
of
trump
administration
efforts
to
weaken
the
standards
the
move
was
the
latest
in
running
political
clashes
between
the
most
populous
state
and
president
donald
trump
s
administration
over
issues
running
from
climate
change
to
immigration
the
california
air
resources
board
the
state
s
air
quality
regulator
affirmed
a
provision
in
its
greenhouse
gas
vehicle
regulation
that
establishes
that
only
cars
meeting
current
federal
standards
for
model
years
through
comply
with
the
state
s
standards
and
can
be
sold
there
the
vote
took
place
at
the
board
s
monthly
meeting
in
sacramento
the
trump
administration
proposed
last
month
to
freeze
federal
fuel
efficiency
requirements
at
levels
through
in
that
proposal
the
administration
said
stricter
emissions
standards
make
vehicles
more
expensive
and
less
safe
california
s
position
is
nationally
significant
because
the
state
is
the
largest
auto
market
and
boasts
the
nation
s
most
aggressive
policies
to
address
climate
change
also
a
dozen
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
have
adopted
california
s
emissions
rules
accounting
for
more
than
a
third
of
all
vehicle
sales
california
has
long
been
allowed
under
a
environmental
protection
agency
waiver
to
set
its
own
stricter
vehicle
emissions
rules
to
fight
heavy
smog
in
los
angeles
and
other
urban
areas
the
trump
administration
has
proposed
revoking
that
authority
something
that
could
cast
doubt
on
the
state
s
powers
to
sidestep
federal
standards
in
a
statement
carb
chair
mary
nichols
said
the
state
would
continue
to
work
to
keep
a
single
national
program
but
that
the
vote
ensures
that
california
and
other
states
will
not
fall
victim
to
the
trump
administration
s
rollback
of
vehicle
standards
should
its
proposal
be
automakers
have
urged
california
and
the
administration
to
reach
agreement
rather
than
face
years
of
uncertainty
automakers
want
looser
emissions
standards
because
consumers
now
favor
bigger
cars
that
use
more
fuel
