stadler
the

chief
executive

a
person
familiar
with

german
daily
handelsblatt
reported
earlier

board
had
held
off
because
of
an
imminent
decision
by
the
german
government
on
how
to
tackle
pollution
from
diesel
vehicles
given
that
germany
s
auto
industry
has
rejected
a
proposal
to
lower
the
emissions
of
older
diesel
vehicles
with
hardware
retrofits
as
too
costly
it
would
be
poor
timing
to
spend
millions
of
euros
to
buy
stadler
out
of
his
contract
which
was
extended
by
five
years
last
year
the
report
said
stadler
was
forced
to
step
down
temporarily
after
he
was
taken
into
custody
in

suspicion
of
interfering
with
an
emissions
investigation
