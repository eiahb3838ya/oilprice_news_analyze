french
gas

group
engie
said
on
friday
that
maintenance
work
at
its
belgian
nuclear
reactor
tihange
would
end
earlier
than
planned
which
could
ease
concerns
over
tight
electricity
supply
belgium
is
facing
an
unprecedented
power
supply
deficit
ahead
of
winter
with
only
one
of
seven
nuclear
reactors
operated
by
engie
s
belgian
unit
electrabel
scheduled
to
have
been
operational

elia
warned
on
wednesday
that
belgium
was
facing
a
tough
supply
situation
due
to
the
outage
of
the
reactors
which
accounts
for
percent
of
its
installed
capacity
with
just
a
few
weeks
to
go
before
winter
starts
belgium
is
facing
the
unexpected
unavailability
of
multiple
nuclear
power
stations
a
situation
that
is
severely
testing
the
balance
between
generation
and
consumption
elia
said
in
a
statement
without
an
additional
megawatts
mw
to
mw
of
capacity
elia
said
it
can
not
always
guarantee
security
of
supply
without
a
power
rationing
or
load
shedding
plan
elia
said
it
was
talking
to
the
belgian
government
and
power
operators
but
security
of
supply
was
not
guaranteed
for
november
the
most
critical
month
and
it
did
not
see
solutions
that
could
fully
resolve
the
supply
issue
which
is
why
even
if
the
belgian
and
international
markets
provide
us
with
all
available
capacity
we
can
not
yet
rule
out
the
need
to
activate
the
plan
elia
said
fears
over
tight
supply
during
the
winter
months
when
demand
for
heating
rises
has
push
belgian
power
contracts
new
highs
engie
said
tihange
will
now
be
shut
for
maintenance
from
until
instead
of
until
electrabel
operates
two
more
reactors
at
tihange
and
four
at
doel
producing
about
half
the
country
s
electricity
following
the
discovery
of
problems
with
the
concrete
in
some
of
the
plants
outages
were
prolonged
at
its
tihange
and
reactors
engie
has
faced
criticism
over
its
management
of
belgium
s
ageing
nuclear
plants
with
belgian
public
broadcaster
rtbf
running
comments
from
an
industry
source
accusing
it
of
allowing
degradation
at
its
facilities
engie
dismissed
the
report
on
friday
saying
nuclear
safety
is
an
absolute
priority
and
that
electrabel
invests
million
euros
million
a
year
in
maintenance
work
the
utility
last
week
said
the
extended
outages
at
belgian
plants
would
push
its
net
recurring
income
to
the
low
end
of
its
billion
euros
