vietnam
s
economy
is
estimated
to
have
grown
percent
over
this
year
the
fastest
growth
since
buoyed
by
upbeat
production
in
manufacturing
and
agricultural
sectors
the
general
statistics
office
gso
said
on
friday
the
southeast
asian
nation
recorded
strong
growth
in
agriculture
and
moderate
expansion
in
manufacturing
and
services
in
the
period
while
processing
and
manufacturing
industries
continued
to
be
the
main
growth
driver
for
the
economy
gso
said
the
growth
rate
was
percent
accelerating
from
the
growth
of
percent
but
lower
than
the
growth
rate
of
percent
gso
said
growth
in
the
first
nine
months
showed
many
positive
results
but
there
are
still
many
challenges
especially
in
the
background
of
the
trade
war
gso
general
director
nguyen
bich
lam
told
a
news
conference
on
friday
the
vietnamese
economy
s
openness
index
is
increasing
very
quickly
with
the
index
in
the
first
nine
months
of
hitting
percent
compared
with
percent
in
and
percent
in
lam
added
the
asian
development
bank
on
wednesday
lowered
vietnam
s
economic
growth
forecast
for
vietnam
to
percent
from
percent
projected
previously
partly
due
to
an
ongoing
trade
friction
between
the
united
states
and
china
the
escalating
trade
friction
between
the
united
states
and
china
poses
a
threat
to
vietnam
due
to
effects
for
countries
such
as
vietnam
which
export
intermediate
goods
to
china
while
weaker
global
demand
will
also
act
as
a
drag
on
growth
prospects
research

capital
economics
said
in
a
report
on
friday
projecting
vietnam
s
growth
rate
to
slow
down
from
percent
this
year
to
percent
in
and
however
lam
said
the
trade
spat
has
not
yet
affected
vietnam
s
exports
to
the
united
states
vietnam
could
seek
opportunities
to
boost
exports
and
welcome
foreign
investments
while
maintaining
risks
such
as
transhipment
to
avoid
tax
similar
tariffs
imposed
on
vietnam
and
global
trade
contraction
he
added
trade
surplus
in
the
first
nine
months
reached
billion
with
exports
rising
percent
from
the
same
period
last
year
to
billion
while
imports
rose
only
percent
to
billion
gso
data
showed
while
we
think
the
economy
will
continue
to
expand
at
a
decent
pace
over
the
coming
years
the
rate
of
growth
will
probably
slow
down

prime
minister

said
on
thursday
the
country

economic
growth
this

the
strongest
pace
