german
carmakers
may
offer
owners
of
vehicles
affected
by
driving
bans
vouchers
for
hardware
upgrades
by
suppliers
such
as
baumot
or
hjs
german
daily
frankfurter
allgemeine
zeitung
faz
reported
on
friday
without
citing
sources
that
would
be
a
compromise
between
some
german
politicians
who
want
bmw
daimler
and
volkswagen
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
making
older
diesel
vehicles
cleaner
and
the
carmakers
who
say
hardware
retrofits
would
be
much
too
expensive
the
report
by
faz
comes
ahead
of
a
diesel
summit
at
the
german
chancellery
on
friday
in
which
the
government
will
try
to
agree
by
an
deadline
a
way
to
tackle
pollution
from
diesel
vehicles
without
resorting
to
further
driving
bans
any
solution
is
likely
to
cost
several
billion
euros
and
transport
minister
andreas
scheuer
said
this
week
his
plan
would
not
require
taxpayer
funds
or
money
from
the
car
owners
putting
the
onus
on
carmakers
instead
a
coalition
committee
is
to
meet
on
monday
to
sign
off
on
any
decisions
faz
said
the
voucher
scheme
would
apply
to
some
diesel
vehicles
meeting
the
euro
emissions
standard
and
would
cover
percent
of
the
cost
of
upgrades
up
to
a
maximum
level
of
euros
per
vehicle
faz
said
older
vehicles
meeting
the
euro
standard
would
not
be
covered
but
their
owners
would
be
offered
incentives
to
swap
their
vehicles
for
new
ones
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
on
thursday
that
volkswagen
was
prepared
to
support
hardware
retrofits
reversing
its
position
and
bowing
to
pressure
that
has
mounted
in
the
three
years
since
it
admitted
to
cheating
