china's sinopec halves iran oil loadings under u.s. pressure -sources
reuters
china
s
sinopec
corp
is
halving
loadings
of
crude
oil
from
iran
this
month
as
the
state
refiner
comes
under
intense
pressure
from
washington
to
comply
with
a
ban
on
iranian
oil
from
november
said
people
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
the
sources
did
not
specify
volumes
but
based
on
the
prevailing
supply
contract
between
the
top
chinese
refiner
and
the
national
iranian
oil
company
nioc
its
loadings
would
be
reduced
to
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
this
would
be
percent
of
china
s
average
daily
imports
from
iran
in
dealing
a
blow
to
tehran
which
has
counted
its
top
oil
client
to
maintain
imports
while
european
and
other
asian
buyers
wind
down
purchases
to
avoid
sanctions
the
cut
marks
sinopec
s
deepest
reduction
in
years
as
the
hong
kong
and
new
state
oil
company
faces
direct
pressure
from
a
administration
determined
to
choke
off
the
flow
of
petrodollars
to
the
islamic
republic
graphic
asia
iranian
crude
oil
imports
the
move
comes
after
senior
officials
visited
the
refiner
in
beijing
last
month
demanding
steep
cutbacks
in
iranian
oil
purchases
said
one
of
the
sources
this
round
is
completely
different
from
last
time
then
it
was
more
of
a
consultative
tone
but
this
time
it
s
almost
like
an
ultimatum
said
the
source
the
sources
declined
to
be
identified
due
to
the
sensitive
nature
of
the
matter
sinopec
declined
to
comment
nioc
did
not
respond
a
reuters
email
seeking
comment
further
complicating
the
matter
iran
is
having
difficulty
securing
insurance
for
its
oil
vessels
said
shipping
and
insurance
sources
as
most
european
and
firms
are
winding
down
their
iranian
business
chinese
buyers
including
sinopec
and
trader
zhuhai
zhenrong
corp
have
since
july
shifted
their
cargoes
to
vessels
owned
by
national
iranian
tanker
co
nitc
to
keep
supplies
flowing
amid
the
reinstatement
of
economic
sanctions
by
the
united
states
during
the
last
round
of
united
nations
sanctions
around
officials
from
washington
asked
chinese
firms
to
curb
investments
in
iranian
oil
and
gas
fields
but
stopped
short
of
demanding
a
full
stop
to
oil
shipments
it
s
not
clear
if
zhuhai
zhenrong
has
also
reduced
loadings
this
month
the
state
trader
is
contracted
to
lift
some
bpd
from
iran
mainly
to
feed
sinopec
refineries
it
s
also
not
clear
if
sinopec
and
petrochina
are
cutting
loadings
from
their
upstream
investment
in
key
iranian
oilfields
that
total
between
to
bpd
these
loadings
are
separate
from
their
annual
supply
contracts
beijing
has
repeatedly
defended
its
energy
trade
with
tehran
worth
about
billion
a
month
as
transparent
and
lawful
some
of
the
top
oil
refineries
that
come
under
sinopec
are
configured
to
process
