reuters
the
largest
oil
trade
association
urged
president
donald
trump
on
friday
to
halt
any
plans
to
lift
a
ban
on
summer
sales
of
higher
ethanol
blends
of
gasoline
and
impose
tighter
trading
restrictions
on
biofuel
credits
saying
such
a
move
would
be
unfair
to
consumers
the
opposition
by
the
american
petroleum
institute
api
means
trump
would
need
to
disappoint
a
key
energy
constituency
in
order
to
move
forward
with
the
plan
to
help
midwestern
farmers
by
expanding
sales
of
ethanol
ahead
of
november
s
congressional
elections
trump
has
repeatedly
said
he
wants
a
solution
to
the
nation
s
controversial
biofuels
policy
which
has
support
from
both
the
rival
corn
and
oil
industries
this
deal
does
nothing
to
fix
the
program
it
makes
things
worse
api
director
frank
macchiarola
said
on
friday
it
is
giving
away
the
store
to
the
ethanol
lobby
and
giving
the
consumers
the
the
api
which
is
concerned
that
expanding
ethanol
sales
would
cut
into
its
market
share
believes
as
many
as
percent
of
cars
are
incompatible
with
gasoline
and
risk
losing
their
warranty
if
it
is
put
into
the
gas
tank
macchiarola
said
the
renewable
fuel
association
disputes
the
api
figure
saying
in
a
tweet
that
percent
of
cars
in
the
united
states
can
safely
use
as
part
of
the
deal
the
white
house
is
considering
imposing
restrictions
on
trading
of
biofuel
credits
in
an
effort
to
discourage
speculation
and
reduce
costs
for
oil
refiners
to
comply
with
biofuels
policy
reuters
reported
the
renewable
fuel
standard
requires
refiners
to
blend
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
fuel
pool
each
year
or
buy
credits
from
competitors
who
do
refining
companies
that
must
buy
the
credits
have
complained
about
volatile
prices
in
recent
years
the
trade
restrictions
would
include
capping
the
number
of
credits
a
dealer
can
hold
at
percent
of
their
company
s
annual
compliance
obligation
and
potentially
also
restricting
certain
parties
from
holding
the
credits
for
more
than
days
macchiarola
said
such
restrictions
would
hurt
liquidity
in
the
rin
market
and
do
more
harm
than
good
biofuel
credit
prices
were
near
highs
last
year
but
have
dropped
sharply
to
their
lowest
since
due
mainly
to
the
epa
s
expanded
use
of
waivers
freeing
small
refiners
from
their
obligations
