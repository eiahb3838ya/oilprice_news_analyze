reuters
royal
dutch
shell
plc
and
chevron
corp
on
friday
led
big
bets
by
oil
majors
seeking
to
clinch
key
stakes
in
brazil
s
coveted
offshore
oil
play
shrugging
off
concerns
over
presidential
elections
that
have
cast
a
pall
of
uncertainty
over
the
industry
shell
and
chevron
pledged
to
the
government
a
high
percent
of
the
oil
it
will
produce
after
costs
to
clinch
the
choice
saturno
block
while
exxon
mobil
corp
and
qatar
petroleum
international
landed
the
tita
area
with
a
percent
offer
with
both
groups
locking
in
key
real
estate
in
the
prized
santos
basin
by
placing
all
four
blocks
brazil
s
government
raked
in
billion
reais
billion
days
ahead
of
the
most
uncertain
presidential
vote
in
a
generation
as
oil
companies
scrambled
to
take
advantage
of
what
could
be
the
last
oil
auction
in
years
leftist
candidates
have
proposed
slowing
down
oil
auctions
revising
legislation
or
even
clawing
back
areas
already
awarded
meanwhile
presidential
jair
bolsonaro
has
floated
the
idea
of
privatizing
state
oil
firm
petrobras
and
has
said
he
would
champion
a
approach
we
take
a
long
term
view
on
these
things
said
felipe
arbelaez
chief
for
latin
america
of
bp
plc
which
took
the
santos
basin
s
pau
brasil
block
in
a
consortium
with
colombia
s
ecopetrol
and
china
s
cnooc
ltd
ultimately
we
think
brazil
has
a
long
track
record
of
respect
of
law
respect
of
contracts
so
we
re
not
very
concerned
about
the
elections
arbelaez
said
lured
by
geology
shrinking
reserves
and
rising
oil
prices
companies
have
already
dropped
billions
of
dollars
in
brazil
latin
america
s
top
oil
producer
to
lock
in
stakes
in
its
layer
where
billions
of
barrels
of
oil
are
trapped
under
a
thick
layer
of
salt
offshore
oil
majors
interest
has
been
boosted
by
policies
under
president
michel
temer
including
loosening
rules
favoring
local
suppliers
tax
sweeteners
and
the
removal
of
a
requirement
that
petrobras
be
sole
operator
in
blocks
but
a
win
by
a
leftist
candidate
could
walk
back
many
of
the
policies
fernando
haddad
a
leftist
academic
who
has
climbed
into
the
no
spot
has
vowed
to
recover
the
to
serve
brazilians
instead
of
foreign
oil
companies
he
also
pledged
to
restore
stricter
requirements
for
using
local
suppliers
ciro
gomes
a
leftist
former
state
governor
in
third
place
has
threatened
to
freeze
auctions
and
expropriate
blocks
already
handed
out
oil
prices
rose
more
than
percent
on
friday
with
brent
climbing
to
a
fresh
high
as
sanctions
on
tehran
squeezed
iranian
crude
exports
tightening
supply
but
oil
majors
discounted
the
role
of
the
price
rise
in
betting
plans
in
brazil
our
decisions
are
not
made
based
on
the
day
s
change
or
price
per
barrel
said
andre
araujo
shell
s
country
chief
in
brazil
they
are
investments
for
years
we
do
not
make
decisions
based
on
volatile
issues
he
added
under
rules
set
up
for
brazil
s
oil
play
consortia
vie
for
blocks
by
offering
the
most
oil
to
the
brazilian
government
and
agree
to
pay
a
fixed
signing
bonus
petrobras
was
the
sole
bidder
and
winner
the
southwest

tartaruga
verde
block
in
the
