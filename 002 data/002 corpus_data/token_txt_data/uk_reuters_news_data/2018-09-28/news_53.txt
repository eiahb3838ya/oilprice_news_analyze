focus-e.on targets innovations for smart energy future
frankfurt
reuters
germany
s
biggest
power
supplier
wants
smart
homes
to
be
smart
business
in
a
world
of
decentralized
energy
markets
that
s
why
it
teamed
up
this
week
with
tech
giant
microsoft
to
produce
a
digital
dashboard
of
all
the
electrical
devices
in
a
home
from
heating
systems
to
solar
panels
to
battery
storage
systems
to
electric
cars
set
to
go
on
sale
next
year
s
home
energy
management
system
will
be
one
of
a
range
of
products
on
offer
from
big
german
utility
companies
desperate
to
increase
profits
from
their
networks
of
millions
of
electricity
and
gas
customers
faced
with
the
prospect
of
flat
earnings
from
just
selling
power
german
utilities
are
offering
products
from
smoke
alarms
electronic
door
locks
ev
charging
kits
broadband
and
even
the
amazon
prime
delivery
service
to
generate
higher
returns
they
re
also
trying
to
get
as
many
new
customers
as
possible
on
board
now
to
build
brand
loyalty
for
when
complex
smart
homes
become
the
norm
rather
than
the
exception
and
need
technology
to
run
efficiently
since
announced
plans
in
march
to
merge
with
rival
innogy
it
has
stepped
up
a
race
with
vattenfall
enbw
and
smaller
utilities
to
persuade
german
customers
to
switch
providers
offering
signing
bonuses
such
as
ipads
washing
machines
or
hundreds
of
euros
in
cash
the
value
of
customers
today
is
different
from
three
to
four
years
ago
because
customers
have
become
more
active
said
victoria
ossadnik
chief
executive
of
s
retail
division
energie
deutschland
a
study
by
consultants
mckinsey
company
showed
that
earnings
before
interest
and
taxes
ebit
from
downstream
power
activities
in
the
european
union
will
grow
by
a
third
to
billion
euros
in
the
years
to
but
none
of
the
increase
will
come
from
classic
power
supply
said
mckinsey
tiziano
bruno
one
of
the
authors
of
the
study
here
published
in
may
bruno
said
the
increase
will
come
from
a
billion
euro
billion
rise
in
the
value
of
energy
efficiency
services
to
billion
and
that
s
why
utility
companies
are
set
on
customers
now
and
coming
up
with
new
products
investors
welcome
the
shift
after
years
of
underperformance
by
utilities
when
low
wholesale
power
prices
led
to
operational
losses
and
plants
were
driven
out
of
the
market
by
renewable
energy
in
germany
s
drive
towards
energy
german
utilities
have
woken
up
and
are
working
hard
to
ensure
the
customer
side
does
not
slip
through
their
fingers
said
thomas
deser
a
fund
manager
at
union
investment
which
holds
percent
of
shares
if
they
manage
to
combine
software
hardware
and
services
there
is
a
great
chance
they
ll
keep
working
with
the
already
has
million
private
residential
accounts
in
germany
besides
companies
municipalities
and
cities
and
its
drive
for
new
clients
helped
it
add
in
the
first
six
months
of
once
it
combines
forces
with
innogy
next
year
it
will
command
a
customer
base
of
million
retail
clients
across
europe
in
countries
such
as
the
united
kingdom
the
netherlands
sweden
italy
czech
republic
hungary
slovakia
and
romania
engaged
in
a
similar
offensive
vattenfall
which
has
million
german
household
power
accounts
has
added
power
and
gas
customers
so
far
this
year
german
chief
tuomo
hatakka
told
reuters
this
month
enbw
has
million
household
customers
in
germany
one
of
the
challenges
for
big
utility
companies
is
to
ensure
they
can
hang
onto
new
customers
to
make
the
cost
of
acquiring
them
worthwhile
and
to
develop
brand
loyalty
for
the
future
germany
bundesnetzagentur
here
the
regulator
for
several
sectors
including
electricity
and
gas
said
million
people
switched
power
accounts
in
while
million
negotiated
improved
terms
with
their
existing
supplier
ralf
kurtz
a
partner
at
pricewaterhousecoopers
estimates
that
power
companies
will
need
to
keep
new
clients
for
at
least
two
years
for
the
exercise
to
become
viable
the
utilities
then
need
to
ensure
they
are
the
ones
offering
products
that
will
let
people
manage
their
energy
supplies
in
an
efficient
way
rather
than
allowing
disruptors
with
experience
of
consumer
data
and
digital
market
places
to
steal
the
show
announcing
its
deal
with
microsoft
to
create
a
digital
dashboard
of
electrical
devices
said
the
market
for
home
management
systems
in
europe
was
a
year
but
this
could
rise
to
at
least
within
three
years
digitisation
internet
of
things
and
artificial
intelligence
provide
us
with
new
opportunities
to
offer
customers
increased
efficiency
and
convenience
said
board
member
karsten
wildberger
development
bank
kfw
said
in
a
study
last
month
that
while
only
percent
of
german
households
use
smart
energy
devices
to
optimize
electricity
and
heat
consumption
percent
can
imagine
using
them
digital
smart
meters
which
monitor
consumption
and
feed
data
back
to
power
suppliers
have
yet
to
take
off
in
germany
unlike
other
eu
countries
such
as
italy
and
the
united
kingdom
the
expected
demand
in
germany
for
more
smart
energy
devices
is
why
the
big
power
companies
are
scouring
the
market
to
snap
up
promising
startups
to
ensure
they
stay
in
the
driving
seat
an
organization
that
has
to
involve
itself
with
its
daily
business
is
unlikely
to
simply
be
able
to
produce
disruptive
innovation
said
uli
huener
head
of
innovation
at
enbw
it
has
adopted
a
strategy
it
lets
employees
develop
ideas
in
an
internal
incubator
it
has
put
million
euros
into
the
enbw
new
ventures
fund
to
buy
minority
stakes
in
startups
and
it
also
has
set
up
an
internal
company
builder
to
help
get
innovative
ideas
up
and
running
a
division
of
called
agile
said
on
wednesday
it
had
chosen
six
european
startups
with
energy
related
products
for
a
sponsorship
program
with
a
view
to
starting
pilot
schemes
that
could
lead
to
commercial
products
already
cooperates
with
companies
such
as
tado
and
nuki
offering
smart
products
like
thermostats
and
electronic
door
locks
and
last
month
it
also
joined
enbw
and
berlin
investment
bank
ibb
here
in
a
financing
round
for
startup
lumenaza
the
german
software
company
has
developed
a
system
it
calls
that
monitors
renewable
power
production
manages
groups
balancing
supply
and
demand
links
renewable
producers
to
customers
and
organizes
billing
creating
digital
marketplaces
for
renewable
energy
suppliers
from
a
wind
farm
to
a
home
is
seen
as
a
significant
opportunity
in
germany
where
there
are
already
million
private
households
with
solar
panels
the
realization
that
the
energy
future
is
green
fragmented
and
decentralized
has
now
arrived
at
the
highest
management
level
