molten
rock
from
several
fissures
opened
by
kilauea
volcano
crept
toward
clusters
of
homes
and
vacation
rentals
on
the
eastern
tip
of
hawaii
s
big
island
on
wednesday
as
authorities
ushered
residents
from
the
area
as
a
precaution
evacuation
of
the
vacationland
development
and
adjacent
kapoho
community
rebuilt
after
a
destructive
eruption
of
kilauea
in
came
on
the
day
of
what
geologists
rank
as
one
of
the
biggest
upheavals
in
a
century
from
one
of
the
world
s
most
active
volcanoes
the
hawaii
county
civil
defense
agency
issued
the
advisory
as
lava
flows
picked
up
speed
late
on
tuesday
and
early
on
wednesday
and
threatened
to
cut
off
a
key
traffic
route
into
the
seaside
area
on
the
far
eastern
flank
of
the
volcano
residents
in
the
kapoho
area
including
kapoho
beach
lots
and
vacationland
are
advised
to
evacuate
the
agency
said
in
a
morning
bulletin
you
are
at
risk
of
being
isolated
due
to
possible
lava
inundation
of
beach
on
tuesday
a
lava
stream
crossed
a
larger
route
highway
as
it
advanced
toward
kapoho
a

flow
of
molten
rock
was
headed
in
the
direction
of
the
vacationland
hawaii
community
to
the
south
civil
defense
officials
also
cited
the
problem
of
widespread
communication
outages
in
the
area
due
to
downed
power
and
phone
lines
reinforcing
the
decision
to
proceed
with
evacuation
plans
immediately
rather
than
wait
for
a
potential
emergency
residents
of
the
area
part
of
the
island
of
hawaii
s
puna
district
were
urged
to
stay
tuned
to
local
radio
stations
for
further
updates
the
numbers
of
people
and
homes
affected
by
the
evacuation
were
not
immediately
known
they
join
some
residents
displaced
due
to
lava
flows
and
toxic
sulfur
dioxide
gas
emissions
at
the
outset
of
the
eruption
nearly
four
weeks
ago
farther
west
in
and
around
the
leilani
estates
community
kilauea
s
main
crater
at
the
volcano
s
summit
has
continued
to
periodically
belch
ash
high
up
into
the
sky
but
national
weather
service
meteorologist
tom
birchard
told
reporters
during
a
conference
call
that
most
of
the
ash
was
blowing
out
to
sea
on
the
prevailing
trade
winds
then
dissipating
quickly
nevertheless
some
ash
and
fumes
have
been
spouted
high
enough
into
the
atmosphere
to
be
carried
far
over
the
pacific
ocean
with
observers
in
the
marshall
islands
micronesia
and
guam
detecting
traces
of
vog
a
hazy
mix
of
sulfur
dioxide
aerosols
moisture
and
fine
particles
birchard
said
kilauea
rumbled
back
to
life
on
may
as
it
began
extruding
lava
and
toxic
gases
through
a
series
of
cracks
in
the
ground
on
its
eastern
flank
marking
the
latest
phase
of
an
eruption
cycle
that
has
continued
nearly
nonstop
for
years
the
occurrence
of
new
lava
vents
or
fissures
now
numbering
about
two
dozen
have
been
accompanied
by
flurries
of
earthquakes
and
intermittent
eruptions
from
the
summit
crater
more
than
homes
and
other
structures
have
been
consumed
by
lava
flows
