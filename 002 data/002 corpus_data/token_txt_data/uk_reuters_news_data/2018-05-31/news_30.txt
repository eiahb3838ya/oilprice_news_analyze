russia
would
be
able
to
raise
its
oil
output
back
to

within
months
if
there
is
a
decision
to
unwind
the
deal
with
opec
and
other
producers
a
russian
energy
ministry

said
moscow
agreed
to
cut
russian
output
by
barrels
per
day
bpd
from
a
high
of
million
bpd
in
october
as
part
of
a
deal
to
tighten
the
market
and
lift
prices
from
less
than
a
barrel
their
lowest
in
more
than
a
decade
this
global
deal
is
valid
until
the
end
of

is
due
to
be
reviewed
by
the
organization
of
the

countries
in

in
vienna
russia
and
opec
leader
saudi
arabia
have
talked
of
a
gradual
increase
in
output
as
the
goal
of
removing
excessive
oil
stockpiles
has
been
achieved
and
the
market
is
broadly
balanced
after
producers
last
year
began
withholding
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
tighten
the
market
and
prop
up
prices
speaking

potential
in
the

growth
potential
in
russia

by
the
companies
as
part
of
the
opec
agreement
pavel
sorokin
a
russian
deputy
energy
minister
told
reuters
in
an
interview
within
a
few
months
we
surely
will
be
able
to
restore
that
level
if
such
a
decision
is
taken
sorokin
added
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
on
saturday
that
returning
to
the
oil
production
levels
of
october
is
one
of
the
options
for
the
future
of
the
deal
rising
output
in
the
united
states
has
been
a
headache
for
other
oil
producers
as
it
has
been
a
major
contributor
to
the
downward
pressure
on
prices
sorokin
a
former
oil
and
gas
analyst
at
morgan
stanley
said
shale
oil
output
the
key
driver
behind
the
stellar
growth
in
the
country
s
oil
production
will
increase
by
million
bpd
this
year
lower
than
some
estimates
there
is
not
enough
infrastructure
there
are
certain
bottlenecks
with
the
staff
availability
equipment
while
lifting
costs
have
started
to
creep
up
