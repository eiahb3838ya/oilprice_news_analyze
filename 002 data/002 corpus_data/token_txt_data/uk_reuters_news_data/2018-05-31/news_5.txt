update 7-u.s. crude tumbles, widening brent's premium to 3-year high
new

reuters
oil
fell
nearly
percent
on
thursday
despite
a
decline
in
crude
inventories
while
global
benchmark
brent
was
little
changed
pushing
the
spread
between
the
two
to
its
widest
in
more
than
three
years
crude
stockpiles
fell
million
barrels
last
week
the
energy
information
administration
said
exceeding
expectations
for
a
decline
of
barrels
gasoline
and
diesel
stocks
rose
but
the
crude
drawdown
was
a
salve
for
recent
losses
in
futures
brent
crude
losses
were
more
limited
as
the
prospect
that
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
will
bring
its
deal
to
a
close
by
the
end
of
the
year
has
had
a
greater
effect
on
the
benchmark
due
to
ongoing
worries
about
infrastructure
constraints
the
market
is
concerned
that
in
the
longer
term
increases
in
oil
production
combined
with
refining
problems
and
limited
outbound
pipeline
capacity
said
andrew
lipow
president
of
lipow
oil
associates
in
houston
crude
production
has
been
rising
to
record
high
levels
since
late
last
year
in
march
it
jumped
bpd
to
million
bpd
a
new
monthly
record
the
eia
said
on
thursday
brent
crude
futures
for
august
ended
down
cents
to
a
barrel
while
west
texas
intermediate
july
crude
settled
or
percent
lower
at
a
barrel
at
one
point
the
premium
for
brent
over
wti
surpassed
a
barrel
the
largest
spread
since
march
that
spread
has
doubled
in
less
than
a
month
as
a
lack
of
pipeline
capacity
in
the
united
states
has
trapped
a
lot
of
output
inland
the
is
blowing
out
i
think
there
must
be
what
looks
like
some
capitulation
going
on
in
the
spread
between
those
two
contracts
saxo
bank
senior
manager
ole
hansen
said
the
wider
premium
makes
crude
exports
more
competitive
than
those
linked
to
the
brent
price
such
as
north
sea
or
west
african
grades
of
oil
brent
had
hit
a
low
below
a
barrel
on
monday
after
opec
and
its
allies
including
russia
indicated
they
could
adjust
their
deal
to
curb
supplies
and
increase
production
opec
and
producers
have
committed
to
cut
output
by
million
bpd
until
the
end
of
but
are
ready
to
make
gradual
supply
adjustments
to
deal
with
shortages
a
gulf
source
familiar
with
saudi
thinking
told
reuters
late
on
wednesday
that
news
helped
boost
brent
as
it
suggests
a
slightly
less
committal
approach
to
adding
barrels
to
the
market
sources
told
reuters
last
week
that
saudi
arabia
the
effective
leader
of
opec
and
russia
were
discussing
boosting
output
by
about
million
bpd
to
compensate
for
losses
in
supply
from
venezuela
and
to
address
concerns
about
the
impact
of
sanctions
on
iranian
output
the
fact
that
we
saw
the
announcement
last
week
could
have
attracted
some
interest
in
narrowing
the
spread
given
that
we
were
looking
for
some
of
the
geopolitical
risk
in
brent
to
be
removed
but
that
s
been
overtaken
by
the
domestic
widening
in
crude
prices
in
the
hansen
said
prices
for
physical
barrels
of
light
sweet
crude
delivered
at
midland
are
at
their
largest
discount
to
the
benchmark
futures
price
in
almost
four
years
concerns
about
bottlenecks
are
contributing
to
the
decline
in
futures

well
