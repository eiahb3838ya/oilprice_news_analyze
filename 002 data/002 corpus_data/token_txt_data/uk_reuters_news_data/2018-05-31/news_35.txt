poll-oil to hold above $70, demand to counter any opec supply rise
reuters
oil
will
stay
above
a
barrel
this
year
because
strong
demand
and
possible
supply
disruptions
in
iran
and
venezuela
will
put
pressure
on
global
inventories
even
though
opec
and
russia
are
considering
raising
output
a
reuters
poll
showed
on
thursday
a
survey
of
economists
and
analysts
forecast
brent
crude
to
average
per
barrel
in
about
higher
than
forecast
in
last
month
s
poll
and
just
above
the
average
so
far
this
year
oil
fundamentals
have
been
increasingly
positive
for
oil
prices
of
late
geopolitical
events
surrounding
iran
and
venezuela
augur
further
oil
supply
loss
adding
to
that
already
generated
by
opec
and
allied
producer
restraint
said
harry
tchilinguirian
global
head
of
commodity
market
strategy
at
bnp
paribas
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
russia
and
several
other
producers
agreed
to
cut
output
from
january
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
cut
a
global
surplus
this
has
led
to
a
rapid
decline
in
inventories
the
drawdown
along
with
concerns
about
further
supply
disruptions
from
venezuela
and
renewed
sanctions
against
iran
fuelled
a
recent
rally
in
prices
driving
benchmark
brent
above
a
barrel
in
may
to
its
highest
since
november
to
compensate
for
the
drop
in
supply
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
been
in
talks
ahead
of
a
key
opec
meeting
in
vienna
in
june
to
raise
oil
production
by
million
bpd
as
a
result
the
oil
price
has
dropped
by
about
percent
from
this
month
s
peak
any
increase
in
output
from
saudi
arabia
and
russia
will
be
a
bearish
price
signal
especially
when
the
output
is
also
climbing
said
abhishek
kumar
senior
energy
analyst
at
interfax
energy
s
global
gas
analytics
in
london
however
some
analysts
say
higher
output
from
saudi
arabia
and
russia
will
not
fully
compensate
for
losses
from
venezuela
and
iran
and
will
only
keep
prices
capped
in
the
near
term
we
expect
that
the
production
will
be
gradual
a
ramp
up
of
bpd
every
month
until
this
is
probably
not
enough
to
bring
the
market
back
into
surplus

the
survey
forecast
wti
crude
futures
will
average
a
barrel
this
year
around
percent
lower
than
the
forecast
for
brent
cheap
oil
relative
to
international
benchmarks
will
lead
to
rising
demand
for
crude
commerzbank
analyst
carsten
fritsch
said
production
in
united
states
is
forecast
to
hit
a
record
high
in
june
widening
the
premium
of
brent
to
light
crude
to
its
biggest
since
march
at
about
a
barrel
oil
production
has
surged
by
more
than
percent
in
the
past
two
years
to
million
bpd
and
analysts
forecast
it
to
grow
by
about
million
to
million
bpd
this
year
