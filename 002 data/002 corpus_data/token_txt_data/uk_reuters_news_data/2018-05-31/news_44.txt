profits
in
the
airline
industry
are
unlikely
to
reach
the
record
levels
forecast
in
december
due
to
a
jump
in
fuel
costs
the
head
of
the
world
s
leading
air
transport
group
said
on
thursday
international
air
transport
association
iata
chief
executive
alexandre
de
juniac
said
his
organization
will
issue
fresh
forecasts
next
week
and
that
airline
profits
were
still
likely
to
be
robust
the
december
projections
were
based
on
oil
at
per
barrel
juniac
said
brent
crude
is
currently
over
per
barrel
having
risen
roughly
percent
so
far
this
year
we
are
probably
at
the
peak
of
the
profit
cycle
next
year
we
don
t
know
yet
but
probably
less
positive
juniac
said
at
a
media
event
ahead
of
the
organization
s
annual
meeting
starting
on
sunday
airline
operators
such
as
singapore
airlines
ltd
and
malaysia
s
airasia
group
bhd
posted
strong
profits
in
the
latest
quarter
ended
march
amid
a
tourism
boom
in
the
region
in
december
iata
predicted
a
record
billion
net
profit
for
the
airline
industry
in
with
billion
coming
from
and
european
airlines
iata
represents
some
airlines
comprising
percent
of
global
air
traffic
juniac
said
higher
fuel
prices
had
not
yet
been
passed
on
in
fares
and
that
infrastructure
and
labor
costs
as
well
as
taxes
were
rising
