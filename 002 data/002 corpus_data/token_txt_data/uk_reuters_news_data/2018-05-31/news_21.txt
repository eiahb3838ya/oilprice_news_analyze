a
year
after
president
donald
trump
vowed
to
pull
the
united
states
out
of
a
global
pact
to
fight
climate
change
experts
lamented
the
move
but
welcomed
efforts
by
cities
and
states
to
fill
the
gap
trump
s
announcement
of
june
last
year
to
ditch
the
deal
agreed
upon
by
nearly
countries
came
over
opposition
by
businesses
and
the
powerful
nation
s
allies
trump
said
leaving
the
deal
signed
by
his
predecessor
barack
obama
would
boost
domestic
energy
production
and
speed
economic
growth
but
it
raised
fears
among
supporters
of
the
agreement
that
other
nations
would
follow
suit
that
was
a
dark
day
said
vicki
arroyo
executive
director
of
georgetown
university
s
climate
center
a
domino
effect
could
have
instead
two
more
countries
syria
and
nicaragua
signed
on
after
trump
s
announcement
but
trump
s
decision
means
some
businesses
now
have
less
incentive
to
move
toward
clean
energy
said
christiana
figueres
the
climate
chief
when
the
paris
agreement
was
signed
that
will
put
them
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
as
global
competitors
shift
away
from
polluting
fossil
fuels
faster
she
said
promoting
the
use
of
coal
over
renewable
energy
sources
is
like
prohibiting
people
from
using
cell
phones
and
asking
them
to
go
back
to
landlines
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
an
interview
on
thursday
that
s
a
pretty
sad
position
to
be
but
growing
public
concerns
about
the
health
risks
of
air
pollution
from
coal
and
other
fossil
fuels
are
also
driving
broader
interest
in
curbing
climate
change
she
said
for
a
long
time
people
tended
to
think
climate
change
was
happening
far
away
to
others
or
would
only
affect
future
generations
she
said
now
more
understand
that
this
is
happening
right
now
and
we
can
do
something
about
it
she
added
the
paris
deal
committed
nations
to
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
keeping
the
global
hike
in
temperatures
well
below
degrees
celsius
above
times
in
december
countries
will
meet
in
poland
to
set
rules
for
the
accord
s
implementation
including
how
to
monitor
emissions
experts
say
momentum
is
compromised
in
the
absence
of
the
united
states
the
world
s
greenhouse
gas
emitter
after
china
we
need
the
back
at
the
table
said
selwin
hart
the
ambassador
of
barbados
at
a
panel
in
washington
organized
by
the
world
resources
institute
wri
andrew
norton
director
of
the
international
institute
for
environment
and
development
said
trump
s
decision
to
stop
further
payments
into
a
major
fund
to
help
poorer
countries
adopt
clean
energy
and
adapt
to
climate
threats
also
threatened
climate
action
around
the
world
without
the
money
and
support
crucial
to
delivering
the
paris
agreement
the
global
effort
to
address
climate
change
may
be
fatally
undermined
he
warned
in
a
statement
nevertheless
a
deluge
of
and
policies
adopted
over
the
last
months
in
the
united
states
from
emissions
reductions
targets
to
a
push
for
electric
cars
is
a
silver
lining
said
experts
on
the
wri
panel
the
planned
departure
from
the
paris
pact
gave
us
a
galvanizing
point
said
angela
navarro
virginia

deputy
secretary

terry
mcauliffe
last
year
ordered
a
push
for
a
system
to
cut
emissions
from
power
plants
citing
the
federal
government
s
retreat
from
the
climate
debate
california
gov
jerry
brown
is
planning
a
global
climate
summit
in
september
states
cities
and
businesses
representing
more
than
half
the
economy
and
population
have
adopted
targets
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
according
to
wri
however
piecemeal
regulation
can
not
match
the
policy
reach
of
the
federal
government
arroyo
said
i
do
think
that
anyone
would
argue
that
we
in
a
better
position
she
said
the
task
definitely
got
harder
