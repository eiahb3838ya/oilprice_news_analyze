norway
s
parliament
should
discuss
next
year
whether
the
country
s
trillion
sovereign
wealth
fund
should
be
able
to
invest
in
unlisted
renewable
projects
such
as
solar
parks
and
wind
farms
parliament
s
finance
committee
said
on
thursday
norwegian
politicians
have
been
debating
whether
the
world
s
largest
sovereign
wealth
fund
should
invest
in
a
new
asset
class
on
top
of
the
stocks
bonds
and
real
estate
it
holds
while
there
had
been
broad
support
to
allow
the
fund
to
invest
in
renewable
infrastructure
the
minority
government
said
in
march
it
was
too
early
to
present
a
bill
to
parliament
on
the
subject
and
did
not
provide
a
precise
timeline
on
thursday
a
united
finance
committee
instructed
the
government
to
present
a
bill
next
year
on
the
topic
so
parliament
could
debate
and
vote
on
the
question
a
key
lawmaker
told
reuters
we
want
to
have
a
better
balance
between
the
fund
s
return
and
risk
said
svein
roald
hansen
the
lawmaker
who
led
the
committee
s
work
on
the
government
s
white
paper
green
groups
welcomed
the
news
as
it
will
likely
be
voted
through
next
year
the
ruling
conservatives
the
opposition
labour
party
and
at
least
five
smaller
parties
are
in
favour
this
is
an
important
contribution
to
achieve
climate
targets
said
baard
vegar
solhjell
head
of
the
wwf
conservation
group
in
norway
the
government
said
in
march
it
was
concerned
about
the
political
risk
of
the
fund
being
stuck
in
a
problematic
investment
it
can
not
get
out
of
as
easily
as
if
it
were
a
listed
company
the
fund
is
managed
by
a
unit
of
the
central
bank
called
norges
bank
investment
management
parliament
decides
the
fund
s
mandate
the
committee
shares
that
view
and
wants
to
progress
carefully
when
it
comes
to
allowing
the
fund
to
invest
in
unlisted
infrastructure
projects
that
are
not
renewables
such
as
bridges
or
roads
other
types
of
unlisted
infrastructure
are
more
complicated
they
can
break
with
the
principles
of
openness
and
transparency
of
the
fund
parliament
s
hansen
said
the
government
has
also
said
that
were
the
fund
to
be
allowed
to
go
into
unlisted
renewables
projects
it
should
be
limited
to
the
fund
s
current
green
investment
mandate
which
amounted
to
billion
norwegian
crowns
billion
at
green
groups
say
this
is
too
low
and
the
finance
committee
said
on
thursday
it
should
be
significantly
higher
without
giving
a
sum
