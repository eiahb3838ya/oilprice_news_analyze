opec
oil
output
fell
to
a
low
in
may
due
to
declining
venezuelan
production
nigerian
outages
and
strong
compliance
with
a
deal
a
reuters
survey
found
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
pumped
million
barrels
per
day
in
may
the
survey
found
down
bpd
from
april
s
revised
figure
the
may
total
is
the
lowest
since
april
according
to
reuters
surveys
opec
is
reducing
output
by
about
million
bpd
as
part
of
a
deal
with
russia
and
other
producers
to
get
rid
of
excess
supply
the
deal
began
in
january
and
in
theory
runs
until
the
end
of
with
the
supply
glut
largely
cleared
and
oil
topping
a
barrel
this
month
for
the
first
time
since
opec
and
russia
are
now
shifting
policy
and
discussing
pumping
more
although
analysts
expect
any
boost
to
be
cautious
opec
s
bias
to
err
on
the
side
of
tightening
remains
intact
said
konstantinos
venetis
senior
economist
at
ts
lombard
easing
the
restrictions
just
means
that
its
line
in
the
sand
moves
slightly
for
now
though
adherence
by
producers
in
the
deal
to
agreed
levels
remains
strong
compliance
slipped
to
percent
of
agreed
cuts
in
may
from
percent
in
april
the
survey
found
meaning
they
are
still
cutting
far
more
than
agreed
the
biggest
decrease
in
supply
came
from
nigeria
due
to
unplanned
outages
royal
dutch
shell
s
nigerian
venture
declared
force
majeure
on
bonny
light
crude
exports
while
loadings
of
another
crude
forcados
are
facing
delays
the
decline
came
from
venezuela
where
the
oil
industry
is
starved
of
funds
because
of
economic
crisis
output
dropped
to
million
bpd
in
may
the
survey
found
a
new
low
production
in
libya
which
remains
unstable
due
to
unrest
edged
lower
because
agoco
an
eastern
libyan
producer
had
to
curb
output
as
unusually
hot
weather
led
to
power
problems
iranian
output
expected
to
decline
as
the
of
sanctions
discourages
companies
from
buying
the
country
s
oil
edged
lower
in
may
but
there
was
no
evidence
yet
of
a
sizeable
drop
sources
in
the
survey
said
opec
s
two
largest
producers
saudi
arabia
and
iraq
both
pumped
slightly
more
in
may
but
not
enough
to
offset
the
declines
elsewhere
saudi
arabia
s
output
edged
up
due
to
more
crude
being
used
in
domestic
power
plants
sources
in
the
survey
said
but
remained
below
the
kingdom
s
opec
target
iraq
the
pumped
more
because
of
an
increase
in
exports
from
the
south
the
outlet
for
most
of
the
country
s
crude
following
a
decline
in
april
output
in
the
country
holding
the
opec
presidency
this
year
the
united
arab
emirates
was
steady
in
may
as
it
continues
to
show
higher
compliance
than
in
sources
close
to
the
matter
said
kuwait
also
maintained
full
compliance
nigeria
and
libya
were
originally
exempt
from
cutting
supply
because
their
output
had
been
curbed
by
conflict
and
unrest
for
both
told
opec
that
output
would
not
exceed
levels
opec
has
an
implied
production
target
for
of
million
bpd
based
on
cutbacks
detailed
in
late
and
taking
into
account
changes
of
membership
since
plus
nigeria
and
libya
s
expectations
of
output
according
to
the
survey
opec
pumped
about
bpd
below
this
implied
target
in
may
not
least
because
of
the
decline
in
venezuela
and
a
similar
involuntary
drop
in
angola
where
the
survey
found
output
was
flat
in
may
