on
thursday
announced
the
start
of
production
at
the
kaikias
field
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
around
one
year
ahead
of
schedule
production
from
the
subsea
deep
water
development
which
will
reach
barrels

equivalent
per

generate
profit

less
than
a
barrel
the
company
said
we
believe
kaikias
is
the
most
competitive
subsea
development
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
a
prime
example
of
the
opportunities
we
re
able
to
advance
with
our
technical
expertise
and
capital
discipline

andy
brown

s
upstream
director
following
the
collapse
in
oil
prices
in
companies
have
sharply
reduced
costs
for
developing
fields
by
slashing
the
cost
of
services
simplifying
engineering
plans
and
increasing
the
use
of
technology
kaikias
is
located
some
miles
kilometres
off
the
coast
of
louisiana
in
the
basin
shell
holds
an
percent
stake
in
the
project
while
japan
s
mitsui
holds
the
remaining
percent
the
field
is
under
around
feet
metres
of
water
and
its
four
wells
are
connected
to
the
ursa
hub
from
where
the
oil
flows
to
the
shore
via
the
mars
pipeline
