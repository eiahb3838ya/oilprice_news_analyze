faced
with
shops
full
of
food
and
other
goods
swathed
in
plastic
families
across
the
world
are
trying
to
reduce
its
use
and
recycle
wherever
possible
to
cut
down
its
impact
on
the
environment
reuters
photographers
met
people
from
athens
to
singapore
trying
to
play
their
part
as
the
war
on
plastics
becomes
a
hot
political
topic
and
governments
work
to
outlaw
items
such
as
drinking
straws
and
cotton
buds
for
the
photo
essay
eight
million
tonnes
of
plastic
bottles
packaging
and
other
waste
are
dumped
into
the
ocean
every
year
killing
marine
life
and
entering
the
human
food
chain

program
said
in
december
the
impact
hit
home
for
eri
sato
when
she
lived
in
canada
and
volunteered
to
clear
up
debris
swept
across
the
ocean
from
japan
where
she
now
lives
in
yokohama
after
the
devastating
earthquake
and
tsunami
there
in
march
it
was
the
first
time
i
realized
how
plastic
waste
pollutes
the
oceans
and
beaches
all
over
the
world
i
think
there
s
no
escaping
the
plastic
waste
she
said
how
to
cut
down
and
eventually
eradicate
it
is
the
question
since
plastic
is
dominating
our
daily
life
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
stop
using
it
but
if
someone
somehow
makes
it
like
a
habit
we
think
we
could
stop
buying
altogether
said
alexandra
patrikiou
in
the
greek
capital
athens
who
works
hard
to
recycle
paper
and
glass
and
buy
recycled
products
her
comments
were
echoed
by
brandy
wilbur
in
wenham
massachusetts
when
shopping
i
do
try
to
buy
products
with
minimal
packaging
but
that
is
challenging
too
everything
is
packaged
the
said
while
governments
and
retailers
started
clamping
down
on
plastic
bags
through
bans
and
small
fees
more
than
a
decade
ago
the
focus
has
now
increasingly
turned
to
eradicating
throwaway
items
such
as
straws
and
food
and
drink
packaging
it
is
really
the
small
plastics
that
stick
around
for
a
long
time
and
leach
into
everything
audrey
gan
said
in
singapore
if
we
are
really
craving
for
a
drink
of
bubble
tea
we
bring
our
own
containers
to
avoid
the
plastic
cup
and
straw
they
come
like
other
families
reuters
spoke
to
the
joshi
family
in
the
indian
city
of
mumbai
has
already
started
taking
measures
such
as
using
bamboo
toothbrushes
unpackaged
shampoo
bars
rather
than
bottles
and
taking
containers
to
restaurants
to
bring
home
any
i
carry
my
own
spoon
fork
and
stainless
steel
straw
to
avoid
single
use
plastic
cutlery
mugdha
tanmay
joshi
said
for
some
it
is
a
personal
battle
overcoming
the
preconceptions
of
others
as
they
try
to
do
their
bit
they
say
are
you
part
of
this
green
movement
they
don
t
understand
it
also
not
using
plastic
bags
for
vegetables
is
considered
disgusting
they
hate
it
but
i
still
do
it
