japan

idemitsu
kosan
does
not
expect
to
close
any
domestic
oil
refineries
as
part
of
its
merger
with
smaller
rival
showa
shell
sekiyu
even
as
local
demand
for
oil
continues
to
fall
that
comes
as
idemitsu
japan
s
oil
refiner
by
sales
battles
to
overcome
entrenched
opposition
to
the
touted
merger
from
its
founding
family
at
a
time
when
the
country
s
refining
market
is
going
through
the
biggest
in
its
history
the
two
refiners
have
struck
a
business
alliance
ahead
of
the
possible
merger
integrating
the
loading
programs
they
use
to
buy
crude
and
working
to
jointly
operate
their
seven
group
refineries
idemitsu
has
already
reduced
refineries
by
half
to
three
and
will
not
close
any
more
ceo
shunichi
kito
told
reuters
in
an
interview
last
month
jxtg
holdings
the
dominant
player
in
a
country
where
a
falling
population
is
using
ever
more
efficient
vehicles
was
formed
last
year
out
of
the
merger
of
jx
and
tonengeneral
it
has
been
considering
closing
at
least
one
of
its
domestic
refineries
seven
refineries
for
idemitsu
and
showa
shell
would
balance
domestic
demand
integration
or
elimination
would
be
unlikely
to
happen
to
us
he
said
kito
said
he
could
not
give
a
timeline
for
the
proposed
merger
with
showa
shell
as
there
has
been
little
progress
in
its
talks
to
win
approval
from
the
founding
family
meanwhile
he
also
said
idemitsu
was
considering
a
minor
upgrade
to
a
secondary
refining
unit
in
response
to
the
international
maritime
organization
s
move
to
ban
use
of
high
sulphur
fuel
he
added
that
the
firm
planned
to
raise
its
overseas
oil
sales
to
roughly
match
domestic
levels
by
pushing
to
compensate
for
a
projected
percent
decline
in
local
gasoline
demand
by
idemitsu
currently
operates
two
filling
stations
in
vietnam
where
it
participates
in
the
nghi
son
oil
refinery
project
and
wants
to
increase
that
to
as
it
mulls
the
best
way
to
expand
in
the
country
kito
said
it
would
also
consider
how
to
enter
the
gas
stand
business
in
nearby
nations
such
as
cambodia
laos
and
myanmar
i
expect
acquisition
capital
participation
or
a
will
be
an
effective
way
rather
than
building
it
from
scratch
