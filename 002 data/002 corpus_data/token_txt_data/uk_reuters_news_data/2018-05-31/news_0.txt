u.s. and brent crude part ways, leaving market flummoxed over oil prices
new
may
reuters
global
oil
markets
have
been
roiled
by
a
surprising
divergence
between
the
world
s
major
benchmarks
brent
crude
and
its
counterpart
which
in
recent
days
have
traded
at
odds
with
one
another
wrongfooting
investors
betting
on
the
exact
opposite
traders
worldwide
have
been
struggling
to
make
sense
of
where
oil
prices
are
headed
juggling
countervailing
signals
from
major
producers
saudi
arabia
and
russia
on
the
path
for
future
opec
supply
against
renewed
sanctions
on
iran
and
venezuela
s
ongoing
economic
crisis
the
market
expected
opec
led
by
saudi
arabia
to
add
to
global
supplies
as
sanctions
reduce
iranian
exports
in
coming
months
but
instead
of
bringing
brent
closer
in
line
with
crude
the
opposite
has
happened
roiling
both
futures
trading
and
key
physical
grades
on
thursday
crude
futures
traded
as
much
as
below
brent
the
deepest
discount
since
early
traders
say
the
tide
of
light
sweet
crude
from
the
united
states
is
threatening
to
swamp
the
global
market
that
whipsawed
traders
in
the
last
several
days
as
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
raised
their
bullish
bets
on
crude
in
the
week
ended
may
while
cutting
long
bets
on
brent
the
opposite
of
what
has
ended
up
happening
the
market
doesn
t
know
where
the
price
of
oil
is
going
to
be
and
probably
doesn
t
know
where
it
should
be
and
so
it
s
open
to
some
major
price
fluctuations
said
richard
hastings
an
independent
analyst
in
charlotte
north
carolina
exports
reached
record
highs
of
over
million
barrels
a
day
this
month
as
cargoes
of
light
sweet
shale
have
muscled
into
refineries
around
the
world
from
china
to
northwest
europe
around
the
atlantic
basin
angolan
and
nigerian
crudes
both
staples
for
chinese
and
indian
refineries
are
now
selling
slowly
undercut
by
grades
traders
said
a
swathe
of
maintenance
at
some
of
asia
s
large
refineries
means
big
buyers
are
not
pushed
to
take
cargoes
of
crude
right
now
and
can
afford
to
be
choosy
when
so
much
is
on
offer
independent
chinese
refineries
known
as
teapots
have
even
started
reselling
cargoes
of
west
african
crude
to
buy
cheaper
brazilian
or
oil
according
to
traders
crude
futures
are
being
pulled
down
in
part
by
the
oil
glut
in
the
permian
shale
basin
which
currently
produces
more
than
million
barrels
a
day
nearly
of
crude
production
which
hit
a
new
record
of
million
bpd
according
to
energy
department
data
released
on
thursday
this
was
inevitable
there
was
way
too
much
production
growth
for
infrastructure
to
handle
said
vikas
dwivedi
global
oil
and
gas
strategist
at
macquarie
in
houston
physical
prices
for
these
trapped
crude
grades
such
as
wti
at
midland
are
now
at
their
weakest
levels
in
years
trading
as
much
as
below
benchmark
futures
that
translates
to
a
to
discount
to
brent
but
coastal
grades
are
trading
at
highs
illustrating
the
demand
globally
for
barrels
coastal
sour
mars
traded
at
its
strongest
differential
in
more
than
three
years
on
thursday
while
prices
for
coastal
benchmark
light
louisiana
sweet
were
at
their
strongest
differential
in
more
than
three
years
on
thursday
lls
traded
on
thursday
at
more
than
futures
making
it
nearly
comparable
to
brent
crude
the
european
market
has
seen
a
sudden
increase
in
the
amount
of
crude
stored
on
ships
often
a
sign
of
an
oversupplied
market
and
that
has
pushed
the
north
sea
grades
that
underpin
the
brent
price
to
lows
another
reason
the
brent
futures
price
should
have
aligned
itself
more
closely
with
crude
