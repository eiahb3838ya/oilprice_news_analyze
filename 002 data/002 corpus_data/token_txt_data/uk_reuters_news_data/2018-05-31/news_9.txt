u.s. withdrawal may halt nuclear nonproliferation work in iran - diplomats
reuters
the
remaining
parties
to
the
iran
nuclear
deal
have
warned
the
united
states
that
its
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
pact
jeopardises
russian
and
chinese
efforts
to
limit
iran
s
ability
to
develop
atomic
weapons
western
diplomats
told
reuters
in
pulling
out
of
the
deal
president
donald
trump
triggered
the
revival
of
sanctions
against
the
atomic
energy
organization
of
iran
aeoi
which
oversees
the
arak
heavy
water
research
reactor
and
the
fordow
fuel
enrichment
plant
under
the
deal
the
arak
reactor
was
to
be
redesigned
to
render
it
unable
to
make
plutonium
under
normal
operation
while
the
fordow
plant
was
to
stop
enriching
uranium
and
be
converted
into
a
nuclear
physics
and
technology
centre
the
restoration
of
sanctions
on
aeoi
would
expose
companies
to
the
risk
of
punishment
by
the
united
states
for
dealing
with
it
including
chinese
china
national
nuclear
and
russia
s
rosatom
which
are
doing
nonproliferation
work
respectively
at
arak
and
fordow
neither
company
responded
to
requests
for
comment
at
a
meeting
in
vienna
last
friday
the
parties
to
the
deal
britain
china
france
germany
russia
and
iran
discussed
the
subject
extensively
with
beijing
and
moscow
stressing
their
concerns
three
european
diplomats
said
one
senior
european
diplomat
called
the
situation
crazy
and
said
the
withdrawal
risked
triggering
a
proliferation
problem
because
its
sanctions
may
halt
work
on
arak
and
fordow
it
may
force
the
interruption
of
the
dismantling
of
iran
s
nuclear
sites
it
s
completely
absurd
the
diplomat
said
iranian
officials
were
not
immediately
available
for
comment
asked
how
washington
planned
to
address
the
concerns
about
aeoi
being
sanctioned
and
how
it
would
serve
interests
not
to
carry
out
the
nonproliferation
work
at
arak
and
fordow
assistant
secretary
of
state
christopher
ford
said
the
was
aware
of
the
other
parties
positions
regarding
aeoi
these
questions
are
all
under
active
consideration
by
the
government
he
said
in
a
statement
relayed
by
a
spokeswoman
our
posture
towards
iran
will
be
geared
towards
obtaining
enduring
nonproliferation
benefits
and
constraining
the
full
range
of
its
malign
the
agreement
between
iran
and
world
powers
lifted
international
sanctions
on
tehran
in
return
iran
agreed
to
restrictions
on
its
nuclear
activities
increasing
the
time
it
would
need
to
produce
an
atom
bomb
if
it
chose
to
do
so
trump
abandoned
the
agreement
on
may
arguing
that
he
wanted
a
bigger
deal
that
not
only
limited
iran
s
atomic
work
but
also
reined
in
its
support
for
proxies
in
syria
iraq
yemen
and
lebanon
and
that
curbed
its
ballistic
missile
program
the
remaining
parties
are
trying
to
keep
the
deal
alive
everyone
is
focused
on
preserving
the
economic
side
of
the
agreement
said
an
eu
diplomat
but
if
the
remaining
parties
fail
on
the
nuclear
side
of
implementation
while
iran
is
trying
to
comply
it
would
really
be
an
the
deal
bars
the
production
of
enriched
uranium
at
fordow
and
says
russia
will
work
with
iran
there
on
producing
stable
isotopes
which
do
not
pose
a
proliferation
risk
on
arak
the
deal
specifies
that
the
new
design
will
aim
to
minimise
the
production
of
plutonium
and
to
prevent
the
production
of
plutonium
in
normal
operation
it
also
specifies
the
fuel
arak
must
use
and
says
its
spent
fuel
for
the
reactor
s
lifetime
must
be
shipped
out
of
iran
sanctions
that
would
prevent
companies
from
dealing
with
aeoi
are
due
to
be
reimposed
no
later
than
the
three
european
diplomats
said
russia
and
china
had
been
especially
vocal
at
the
vienna
meeting
with
one
saying
that
the
two
nations
indicated
they
were
determined
to
carry
out
the
nuclear
projects
but
stressed
their
worries
on
sanctions
two
other
western
officials
also
confirmed
that
the
subject
was
discussed
at
the
meeting
the
which
initially
led
a
working
group
to
redesign
the
arak
reactor
with
china
did
not
attend
the
vienna
talks
beijing
s
envoy
to
the
talks
told
reporters
on
friday
that
the
parties
needed
to
find
a
for
arak
to
move
forward
richard
nephew
a
former
administration
official
under
president
barack
obama
said
it
was
unlikely
the
would
sanction
chinese
or
russian
companies
for
doing
work
with
iran
although
it
was
a
possibility
the
real
problem
is
does
this
stop
these
countries
and
the
companies
from
their
work
to
render
the
arak
and
fordow
facilities
safer
he
said
if
it
causes
them
to
stop
that
work
and
gives
iran
an
excuse
to
restart
fordow
or
to
rebuild
arak
as
a
reactor
then
we
will
have
done
real
damage
to
our
nonproliferation
