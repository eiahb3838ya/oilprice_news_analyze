update 2-hamburg to maintain diesel ban until berlin enforces retrofits
reuters
hamburg
will
uphold
a
ban
on
older
diesel
cars
until
air
quality
improves
or
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
government
enforces
retrofits
of
technology
a
senior
local
official
said
on
thursday
the
ban
only
affects
meters
of
hamburg
s
and
km
of
stresemann
street
but
is
significant
because
it
is
the
first
such
move
in
germany
and
because
it
could
raise
pressure
on
car
makers
to
undertake
costly
retrofits
jens
kerstan
senator
for
the
environment
in
hamburg
germany
s
city
with
a
population
of
some
million
said
the
bans
affecting
diesel
models
that
fail
to
meet
the
latest
emissions
standards
will
be
maintained
until
the
government
gets
automakers
to
install
new
systems
in
diesel
cars
it
s
our
goal
and
our
responsibility
to
protect
the
citizens
against
harmful
exhaust
gases
kerstan
a
member
of
the
green
party
said
at
a
press
briefing
of
hamburg
s
kilometer
road
network
only
kilometers
are
affected
by
the
ban
kerstan
said
such
measures
could
be
proliferating
in
germany
where
the
country
s
top
administrative
court
ruled
in
february
that
stuttgart
home
to
daimler
and
porsche
and
duesseldorf
should
consider
such
a
ban
merkel
s
social
democrat
coalition
partners
have
repeatedly
called
for
hardware
fixes
as
a
means
to
help
tackle
diesel
pollution
but
transport
minister
andreas
scheuer
of
the
christian
social
union
sister
party
of
merkel
s
christian
democrats
opposes
such
action
there
are
legal
financial
and
technical
reservations
against
hardware
retrofits
that
must
not
be
overlooked
scheuer
told
the
rnd
group
of
newspapers
adding
that
prospects
for
hardware
fixes
would
cause
panic
among
car
owners
the
german
association
of
the
automotive
industry
vda
said
hardware
retrofits
were
complicated
and
needed
years
of
development
suggesting
software
solutions
made
more
sense
manufacturers
are
equipping
millions
of
diesel
cars
with
new
engine
software
this
will
reduce
nitrogen
oxide
emissions
to
percent
on
average
a
vda
spokesman
said
an
expert
report
reviewed
by
scheuer
s
department
earlier
this
month
concluded
that
the
federal
government
can
not
force
automakers
to
carry
out
component
changes
on
diesel
cars
unless
excessive
pollution
is
caused
by
deliberate
fraud
the
study
backed
the
berlin
government
s
current
stance
of
relying
on
carmakers
voluntary
upgrades
of
software
to
bring
exhaust
levels
into
line
with
eu
limits
environmentalists
called
the
hamburg
restrictions
a
small
but
important
step
in
the
right
direction
noting
that
cities
would
no
longer
have
legal
excuses
to
shun
bans
to
reach
targets
but
some
environmental
groups
said
the
restrictions
would
shift
toxic
nitrogen
oxide
nox
emissions
to
adjacent
streets
as
drivers
of
older
diesel
cars
find
other
routes
while
policing
the
bans
will
be
hard
if
the
cars
are
not
labeled
in
some
way
hamburg
environmental
authorities
acknowledge
that
there
are
similarly
high
levels
of
pollution
elsewhere
in
the
city
but
there
are
no
measuring
stations
there
juergen
resch
director
of
environmental
group
duh
told
deutschlandfunk
on
thursday
adding
the
bans
reflected
political
posturing
while
some
road
users
including
residents
trash
collectors
and
cab
drivers
are
exempt
from
the
restrictions
some
business
groups
voiced
concern
about
the
implications
driving
bans
are
a
declaration
of
bankruptcy
of
the
transportation
policy
and
a
dangerously
wrong
path
with
great
risks
for
vital
inner
cities
and
retail
josef
sanktjohanser
head
of
the
association
of
german
retailers
representing
about
companies
said
germany
and
five
other
european
states
face
possible
fines
for
violating
air
quality
standards
after
the
european
commission
said
this
month
it
would
take
them
to
the
region
s
highest
court
over
the
matter
