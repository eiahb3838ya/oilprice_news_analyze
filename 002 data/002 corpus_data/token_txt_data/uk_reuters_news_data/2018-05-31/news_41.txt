gain
access
to
the
nation
s
teapot
refining
market
executives
told
reuters
the
push
by
exxon
the
world
s
biggest
oil
and
gas
company
by
market
value
to
court
the
independent
refiners
known
as
teapots
illustrates
the
clout
they
are
exerting
on
the
global
oil
market
since
winning
crude
import
licenses
from
the
government
in
the
refiners

big
foreign
crude

oil
trade
show
in

evening
exxon
s
team
wined
and
dined
prospective
customers
and
traders
at
a
dinner
attended
by
around
guests
according
to
multiple
people
who
attended
goodie
bags
at
the
party
contained
flasks
for
travel
use
they
said
the
marketing
blitz
is
a
departure
from
exxon
s
traditional
methods
of
peddling
their
crude
such
as
meetings
i
have
never
seen
exxonmobil
ever
do
this
kind
of
thing
in
my
whole
career
said
lau
kay
hoe
a
delegate
who
retired
recently
after
more
than
three
decades
working
in
shipping
and
trading
at
the
company
exxon
produces
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
from
europe
africa
the
middle
east
and
the
americas
that
mainly
supplies
its
own
refining
system
the
company
push
occurs
amid
a
looming
trade
war
between
the
united
states
and
china
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
the
two
sides
agreed
in
talks
earlier
this
month
that
energy
sales
were
crucial
to
offsetting
the
billion
trade
deficit
the
has
with
china
its
top
trading
partner
martenak
who
flew
in
from
houston
for
the
event
said
the
firm
was
drawn
by
the
growing
importance
of
china
s
independent
refiners
in
the
regional
market
rather
than
politics
this
was
the
first
publicity
push
by
the
oil
sales
and
supply
team
in
the
eight
years
since
he
took
over
the
reins
as
the
global
marketing
chief
he
said
we
probably
are
not
as
fast
as
some
of
the
traders
we
want
to
make
it
up
quickly
so
we
can
become
a
major
supplier
in
the
region
he
told
a
seminar
on
tuesday
martenak
s
team
has
also
met
with
potential
teapot
clients
in
private
meetings
this
week
but
their
main
purpose
was
to
act
as
exxon
s
ambassador
rather
than
cutting
deals
he
told
reuters
at
its
booth
new
rules
from
the
international
maritime
organization
requiring
ships
to
use
fuel
starting
in
will
also
likely
boost
china
s
need
for
sweet
or
crude
he
said
exxon
s
charm
offensive
is
starting
in
dongying
an
oil
town
built
in
the
on
china
s
oilfield
the
city
is
now
the
country
s
biggest
refining
center
with
more
refineries
and
total
annual
refining
capacity
of
million
tonnes
or
about
million
bpd
china
has
nearly
independent
refiners
and
since
winning
their
import
quotas
three
years
ago
they
now
buy
of
china
s
crude
oil
imports
of
million
bpd
most
of
china
s
teapots
are
in
shandong
sucking
in
crude
from
west
africa
russia
oman
and
brazil
exxon
s
late
arrival
means
they
face
competition
from
global
peers
such
as
bp
and
royal
dutch
shell
additionally
global
traders
vitol
trafigura
and
mercuria
were
among
the
early
movers
to
the
teapot
market
their
traders
make
monthly
visits
to
shandong
which
often
involve
entertaining
over
drinks
before
discussing
deals
bp
s
china
marketing
team
in
beijing
and
shanghai
is
the
largest
among
the
international
oil
majors
followed
by
shell
exxonmobil
like
chevron
are
late
comers
in
the
shandong
market
said
an
independent
refining
executive
at
a
plant
in
dongying
they
are
very
strong
in
global
supply
sources
but
compared
to
traders
like
mercuria
trafigura
and
vitol
their
knowledge
of
the
local
market
is
not
as
