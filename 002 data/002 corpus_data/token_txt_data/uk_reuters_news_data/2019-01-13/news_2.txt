halt

on
the
billion
gas
pipeline
the
pipeline
which
would
carry
gas
straight
to
germany
under
the
baltic
sea

also
been
criticized

quarters
because
it
would
deprive

of
lucrative
gas
transit
fees
potentially
making
kiev
more

the

within

government
one
german
diplomat
said
the

practice

address
the

in

talks
with

foreign
policy
spokesman
for
merkel
s
conservatives
in
parliament
was
scathing
in
his
criticism
of
the
move
that
the
ambassador
is
now
turning
to
german
companies
with
direct
threats
is
a
new
and
unacceptable
tightening
of
the
tone
in
the
transatlantic
relationship
hardt
said
if
the
president
thinks
he
has
to
publicly
show
he
is
getting
tough
on
russia
in
view
of
the
many
question
marks
regarding
his
relationship
with
moscow
he
should
not
thereby
impair
the
relationship
with
his
most
important
there
was
no
comment
on
sunday
from
the
german
companies
involved
in
the
project
a
uniper
spokesman
declined
to
comment
and
wintershall
did
respond
immediately
to
a
request
for
comment
germany
and
russia
have
been
at
odds
since
moscow
annexed
crimea
from
ukraine
in
however
both
have
a
common
interest
in
the
nord
stream
project
which
is
expected
to
double
capacity
of
the
existing
nord
stream
route
german
newspaper
bild
am
sonntag
which
was
first
to
report
news
of
the
letter
said
that
grenell
was
trying
to
blackmail
german
companies
drawing
a
sharp
denial
from
the
embassy
the
only
thing
that
could
be
considered
blackmail
in
this
situation
would
be
the
kremlin
having
leverage
over
future
gas
supplies
the
embassy
spokesman
said
the
letter
was
coordinated
in
washington
by
several
government
agencies
and
is
not
meant
to
be
a
threat
but
a
clear
message
of
policy
the
spokesman
added
german
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
on
thursday
said
that
any
sanctions
against
nord
stream
would
be
the
wrong
way
to
solve
the
dispute
and
that
questions
of
european
energy
policy
had
to
be
decided
in
europe
not
in
the
united
states
