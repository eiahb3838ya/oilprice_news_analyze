a
drastic
percent
overnight
rise
in
zimbabwe
s
fuel
prices
failed
on
sunday
to
ease
a
nationwide
petrol
and
diesel
shortage
caused
by
a
lack
of
hard
currency
most
service
stations
still
had
no
fuel
to
sell
to
motorists
who
have
been
sleeping
in
their
vehicles
to
queue
some
said
they
were
awaiting
an
official
notice
from
the
regulatory
authority
zera
deputy
information
minister
energy
mutodi
tweeted
that
commodity
price
volatility
will
be
temporary
before
goods
prices
normalise
the
acute
shortage
of
dollars
has
made
it
hard
for
president
emmerson
mnangagwa
s
government
to
import
not
only
fuel
but
also
drugs
and
other
goods
mnangagwa
himself
was
on
sunday
setting
off
on
a
tour
that
starts
in
russia
and
ends
at
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
switzerland
zimbabwe
abandoned
its
own
currency
in
after
it
was
wrecked
by
hyperinflation
and
adopted
the
greenback
and
other
hard
currencies
such
as
sterling
and
the
south
african
rand
but
now
there
is
not
enough
hard
currency
to
back
up
more
than
billion
in
electronic
funds
trapped
in
local
bank
accounts
prompting
demands
from
businesses
and
civil
servants
for
cash
that
can
be
deposited
and
used
to
make
payments
mnangagwa
has
said
his
government
will
not
let
businesses
raise
prices
but
they
have
been
doing
so
anyway
arguing
that
they
have
no
choice
but
to
buy
dollars
at
a
premium
on
the
black
market
inflation
is
already
at
a
high
of
percent
and
in
the
past
two
weeks
public
transport
firms
have
tripled
fares
citing
a
shortage
of
fuel
which
some
have
been
buying
on
the
black
market
an
assistant
at
a
service
station
owned
by
zuva
petroleum
said
we
have
not
received
any
supplies
since
thursday
evening
but
we
are
hoping
we
will
get
a
delivery
before
end
of
the
a
zera
spokesman
said
all
fuel
companies
had
been
notified
of
the
new
prices
the
zimbabwe
congress
of
trade
unions
zctu
said
it
planned
a
national
strike
from
monday
in
protest
at
the
insensitive
and
provocative
fuel
price
increase
although
such
calls
have
in
the
past
not
been
widely
followed
teachers
who
are
not
represented
by
zctu
are
planning
a
nationwide
strike
from
and
civil
servants
have
threatened
to
join
them
