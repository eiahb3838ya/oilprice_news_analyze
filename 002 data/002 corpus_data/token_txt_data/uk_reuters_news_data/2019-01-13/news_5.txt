germany
has
warned
companies
involved
in
the
construction
of
the
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
that
they
could
face
sanctions
if
they
stick
to
the
project
a
senior
official
said
on
sunday
president
donald
trump
has
accused
germany
of
being
a
captive
of
moscow
due
to
its
reliance
on
russian
energy
and
urged
it
to
halt
work
on
the
billion
gas
pipeline
the
pipeline
which
would
carry
gas
straight
to
germany
under
the
baltic
sea
is
driving
a
wedge
between
germany
and
its
allies
as
it
would
deprive
ukraine
of
the
lucrative
gas
transit
fees
it
currently
enjoys
ambassador
richard
grenell
addressed
the
issue
in
a
letter
sent
to
several
companies
the
embassy
said
the
letter
reminds
that
any
company
operating
in
the
russian
energy
export
pipeline
sector
is
in
danger
under
caatsa
of
sanctions
the
spokesman
said
adding
that
other
european
states
also
opposed
the
planned
pipeline
germany
and
other
european
allies
accuse
washington
of
using
its
countering
america
s
adversaries
through
sanctions
act
caatsa
to
meddle
in
other
counties
foreign
and
energy
policies
due
to
its
extraterritorial
effect
there
was
no
immediate
reaction
to
grenell
s
remarks
from
the
german
government
and
firms
participating
in
nord
stream
germany
and
russia
have
been
at
odds
since
moscow
annexed
crimea
from
ukraine
in
but
they
have
a
common
interest
in
the
nord
stream
project
which
is
expected
to
double
the
capacity
of
the
existing
nord
stream
route
german
newpaper
bild
am
sonntag
which
was
first
to
report
on
the
letter
said
that
grenell
was
trying
to
blackmail
german
companies
with
the
letter
the
embassy
denied
the
accusation
the
only
thing
that
could
be
considered
blackmail
in
this
situation
would
be
the
kremlin
having
leverage
over
future
gas
supplies
the
embassy
spokesman
said
the
letter
was
coordinated
in
washington
by
several
government
agencies
and
is
not
meant
to
be
a
threat
but
a
clear
message
of
policy
the
spokesman
added
russian
gas
giant
gazprom
is
implementing
the
project
jointly
with
its
western
partners

german
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
said
on
thursday
that
any
sanctions
against
nord
stream
would
be
the
wrong
way
to
solve
the
dispute
and
that
questions
of
european
energy
policy
had
to
be
decided
in
europe
not
in
the
united
states
