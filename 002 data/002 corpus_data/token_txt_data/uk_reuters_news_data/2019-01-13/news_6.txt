uncertain
path
with
a
vote
for
a

for
its
exit
from

all

ahead
of

of
more
immediate
concern
was
trade

china
later
in

with
recent
signs
asia
s
largest
economy

losing
momentum
and
the
government
planning
to
lower
its
economic
growth
target
the
tariff
war
has
already
disrupted
trade
flows

billions

dollars
worth
of

and
roiled
global
markets
while
the
two
countries
have
been
talks

few
details
have
been
provided
of
any
progress
made
it
s
a
relatively
quiet

of

data
releases
with
probably
the
chinese

balance
the
only

elsewhere
the

slipped
again
as
it
hit
key
technical
levels
following
