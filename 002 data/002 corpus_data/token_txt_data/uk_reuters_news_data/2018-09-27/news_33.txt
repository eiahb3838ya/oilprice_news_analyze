the
eu
energy
watchdog
urged
a
bosnian
regional
parliament
on
thursday
not
to
approve
a
government
guarantee
for
a
china
exim
bank
loan
that
is
designed
to
help
power
utility
epbih
add
a
new
unit
at
its
tuzla
power
plant
the
guarantee
covers
percent
of
the
total
value
of
the
contract
signed
last
november
for
the
largest
investment
in
bosnia
s
postwar
energy
infrastructure
epbih
s
shareholders
gave
it
the
this
month
but
it
must
still
be
approved
by
the
parliament
of
the
autonomous
federation
the
energy
community
an
international
body
established
by
the
eu
and
eight
aspiring
member
states
to
extend
the
bloc
s
energy
policy
to
members
said
the
guarantee
may
constitute
illegal
state
aid
and
that
the
vote
should
be
put
on
hold
until
the
case
has
been
properly
investigated
such
approval
could
lead
to
lengthy
and
costly
recovery
procedures
besides
the
energy
community
secretariat
may
have
to
open
infringement
procedures
against
bosnia
and
herzegovina
its
head
janez
kopac
said
in
a
letter
to
lawmakers
made
available
to
reuters
the
move
follows
a
complaint
from
environmentalist
groups
opposed
to
the
project
they
accused
the
government
of
the
federation
of
trying
to
rush
the
deal
through
the
parliament
before
national
and
regional
elections
in
bosnia
on
they
argued
that
under
the
energy
community
treaty
bosnia
must
follow
eu
rules
on
subsidies
in
the
energy
sector
among
other
things
in
most
cases
state
guarantees
may
only
cover
a
maximum
percent
of
the
total
loan
amount
they
said
in
the
complaint
the
balkans
are
increasingly
turning
to
china
for
funding
as
the
european
union
the
world
bank
and
other
institutions
cut
back
on
financing
projects
china
gezhouba
group
and
guandong
electric
power
were
picked
to
build
the
megawatt
mw
unit
in
the
city
of
tuzla
at
a
cost
of
billion
bosnian
marka
billion
to
replace
three
outdated
units
at
the
mw
plant
chinese
firms
are
implementing
a
series
of
projects
in
the
balkans
mainly
in
the
energy
sector
and
worth
around
billion
euros
in
bosnia
alone
environmentalists
object
to
the
coal
projects
planned
with
china
saying
they
do
not
meet
eu
rules
and
could
add
to
already
high
levels
of
air
pollution
while
also
exposing
bosnia
to
costly
plant
upgrades
once
it
