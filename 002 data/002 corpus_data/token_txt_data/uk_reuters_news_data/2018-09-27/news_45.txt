rpt-column-third time lucky for ecb on rates as oil eyes $100: mcgeever

the
european
central
bank
s
interest
rate
hikes
of
and
were
perhaps
the
biggest
policy
errors
in
recent
central
banking
history
with
oil
coming
into
view
again
the
last
thing
the
ecb
wants
is
a
repeat
twice
bitten
thrice
shy
the
price
of
brent
crude
oil
this
week
hit
a
barrel
the
highest
in
almost
four
years
it
s
up
percent
over
the
past
year
an
inflationary
red
flag
the
ecb
would
normally
find
difficult
to
ignore
also
this
week
ecb
president
mario
draghi
told
the
european
parliament
that
an
acceleration
in
underlying
inflation
in
the
euro
zone
was
relatively
vigorous
and
expressed
confidence
that
a
in
wage
growth
would
continue
add
all
that
together
you
might
think
the
ecb
would
quite
readily
backtrack
on
its
pledge
to
keep
interest
rates
at
historically
levels
through
the
summer
of
next
year
and
deliver
an
rate
hike
or
two
earlier
not
this
time
if
anything
an
oil
price
shock
of
crude
breaking
above
a
barrel
could
tempt
the
current
incumbents
in
frankfurt
s
eurotower
to
ease
policy
or
at
the
very
least
go
looser
for
longer
rather
than
tighten
firstly
the
current
spike
in
oil
is
more
a
function
of
supply
constraints
than
surging
demand
sanctions
on
opec
members
venezuela
and
iran
have
hit
production
there
while
spare
capacity
from
opec
and
its
allies
remains
historically
low
according
to
nomura
the
world
economy
led
by
the
united
states
is
growing
at
a
robust
and
steady
clip
but
the
balance
of
risks
to
growth
from
trade
wars
to
rising
interest
rates
is
tilted
to
the
downside
slowing
economic
growth
will
cap
oil
demand
secondly
oil
prices
notoriously
overshoot
accelerating
in
the
to
cyclical
peaks
and
troughs
this
means
they
rise
far
higher
and
fall
much
further
than
commentators
thought
possible
just
a
few
months
earlier
thirdly
signs
of
oil
remaining
high
say
above
for
an
extended
period
could
squeeze
corporate
profits
and
potentially
force
companies
to
lay
off
workers
rising
unemployment
in
what
is
already
a
fractious
and
dangerous
political
environment
would
surely
be
viewed
with
alarm
in
frankfurt
in
short
there
s
a
case
to
be
made
that
this
would
be
bad
inflation
not
good
inflation
certainly
not
the
time
for
a
of
or
the
ecb
raised
rates
in
july
as
oil
hit
a
record
high
having
doubled
over
the
previous
year
this
was
right
in
the
midst
of
the
global
credit
crunch
bear
stearns
had
been
rescued
only
a
few
months
before
and
lehman
brothers
would
collapse
a
few
weeks
later
in
oil
was
again
above
and
the
ecb
raised
rates
not
once
but
twice
just
as
the
euro
zone
debt
crisis
was
bubbling
up
greece
and
ireland
had
already
received
bailout
packages
and
bond
yields
in
spain
and
italy
were
ballooning
to
levels
that
would
eventually
prompt
draghi
s
whatever
it
takes
intervention
a
year
later
policymakers
will
be
more
cautious
this
time
around
not
least
because
inflation
although
at
target
is
lower
than
it
was
then
headline
inflation
is
running
at
percent
whereas
it
nudged
percent
in
and
percent
in
the
ecb
expects
its
trillion
euro
trillion
bond
purchase
scheme
to
end
at
the
close
of
this
year
and
keep
rates
low
through
the
summer
of
next
the
guidance
on
rates
is
vague
enough
to
give
the
ecb
a
lot
of
leeway
it
could
raise
rates
in
september
next
year
or
december
or
not
at
all
and
still
justifiably
have
kept
its
pledge
further
reading
vigorous
inflation
recovery
still
needs
low
rates
ecb

not
planning
to
speed
up
normalisation
