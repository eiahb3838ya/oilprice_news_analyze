oil
gas
convention

we
are
principally
in
the
exploration
phase
so
my
big
task
now
is
to
drill
some
wells
so
that
we
can
start

exxon
has
plowed
big
money
into
brazil
to
replenish
its
dwindling
reserves
starting
with
an
oil
auction
in
september
of
last
year
before
that
it
was
among
the
few
oil
majors
without
an
exploration
presence
in
brazil
s
where
billions
of
barrels
of
oil
are
trapped
under
a
thick
layer
of
salt
beneath
the
ocean
floor
the
american
oil
major
is
expected
to
bet
big
on
friday
in
an
oil
auction
that
could
be
its
last
crack
at
brazil
s
coveted
offshore
oil
for
another
four
years
as
a
election
spurs
fears
about
barriers
to
foreign
investment
