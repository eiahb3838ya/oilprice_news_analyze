reuters
nuclear
power
generators
urged
the
federal
government
against
taking
action
in
a
dispute
over
imported
uranium
arguing
tariffs
or
quotas
would
increase
costs
for
the
struggling
industry
and
possibly
cause
some
reactors
to
shut
according
to
a
statement
emailed
on
wednesday
the
department
of
commerce
doc
launched
a
section
investigation
into
uranium
imports
in
july
following
complaints
by
two
uranium
mining
companies
inc
and
energy
fuels
inc
that
subsidized
foreign
competitors
have
caused
them
to
cut
capacity
and
lay
off
workers
the
move
is
a
sword
for
president
donald
trump
while
it
helps
domestic
uranium
producers
by
targeting
importers
it
undercuts
the
administration
s
efforts
to
give
a
boost
to
nuclear
power
operators
who
would
see
their
fuel
costs
increase
imposing
additional
regulatory
burdens
on
the
already
struggling
nuclear
energy
industry
will
put
good
paying
domestic
jobs
and
careers
at
risk
and
is
inconsistent
with
president
trump
s
and
the
department
of
energy
s
policy
pronouncements
david
tamasi
spokesperson
for
nuclear
group
called
the
ad

group
ahug
said
in
a
statement
the
white
house
has
been
trying
to
find
a
way
to
prevent
additional
coal
and
nuclear
plants
from
shutting
which
the
administration
sees
as
vital
for
national
energy
security
as
they
struggle
to
compete
with
cheaper
alternatives
like
natural
gas
and
renewable

along
with
commercial
nuclear
reactors
that
produce

consumed

the
nuclear
industry
said
a
diverse
uranium
supply
is
essential
to
keep
that
power
flowing
in
about
percent
of
the
uranium

according
to

if
the

does
not
survive
we
will
essentially
hand
over

unfriendly
