update 1-saudi arabia in short-term oil fix, fears extra u.s. supply next year
dubai
reuters
saudi
arabia
will
quietly
add
extra
oil
to
the
market
over
the
next
couple
of
months
to
offset
a
drop
in
iranian
production
but
is
worried
it
might
need
to
limit
output
next
year
to
balance
global
supply
and
demand
as
the
united
states
pumps
more
crude
the
kingdom
opec
s
top
producer
came
under
renewed
pressure
last
week
from
president
donald
trump
to
cool
oil
prices
ahead
of
a
meeting
in
algiers
between
a
number
of
opec
ministers
and
allies
including
russia
two
sources
familiar
with
opec
policy
said
saudi
arabia
and
other
producers
discussed
a
possible
production
increase
of
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
among
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
allies
but
riyadh
decided
against
pressing
for
an
official
increase
now
as
it
realized
it
would
not
secure
agreement
from
all
producers
present
at
the
talks
some
of
which
lack
spare
production
capacity
and
would
be
unable
to
boost
output
quickly
such
a
move
would
have
unsettled
relations
among
producers
the
sources
said
with
the
saudis
keen
to
maintain
unity
among
the
alliance
in
case
riyadh
wants
to
change
course
in
future
and
seek
their
collaboration
on
an
output
cut
there
are
only
two
months
left
until
the
end
of
the
year
so
why
create
tensions
now
between
saudi
arabia
iran
and
russia
one
source
familiar
with
the
algiers
discussions
said
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
on
sunday
he
was
concerned
that
oil
production
gains
mainly
from
the
united
states
could
outstrip
a
projected
increase
in
oil
demand
and
result
in
an
inventory
overhang
globally
there
are
more
demand
threats
next
year
compared
to
supply
threats
said
the
second
source
who
also
has
knowledge
of
the
talks
oil
prices
rose
to
their
highest
since
above
per
barrel
this
week
on
fears
that
a
steep
decline
in
iranian
oil
exports
because
of
new
sanctions
will
deepen
an
oil
deficit
along
with
production
declines
in
venezuela
however
opec
s
latest
report
released
at
the
weekend
forecast
that
its
rivals
led
by
the
united
states
would
increase
output
by
million
bpd
in
while
global
oil
demand
should
grow
by
just
million
bpd
that
saudi
thinking
goes
could
create
a
large
surplus
of
crude
next
year
especially
if
a
stronger
dollar
and
weaker
emerging
market
economies
reduce
global
demand
for
oil
the
big
unknown
however
is
to
what
extent
iran
will
be
forced
to
reduce
output
next
year
as
customers
in
europe
and
asia
walk
away
from
its
oil
in
reaction
to
sanctions
opec
s
own
reports
show
iranian
supply
has
already
fallen
by
around
bpd
in
recent
weeks
although
iran
insists
it
has
remained
steady
at
some
million
bpd
sources
familiar
with
saudi
production
plans
said
the
kingdom
would
raise
output
by
some
bpd
in
september
and
october
on
top
of
the
million
bpd
it
produced
in
august
to
meet
additional
client
demand
mainly
in
asia
state
firm
saudi
aramco
plans
to
add
new
crude
output
capacity
of
some
bpd
in
the
fourth
quarter
from
the
khurais
and
manifa
oilfields
allowing
it
more
flexibility
to
raise
production
if
needed
a
source
told
reuters
on
thursday
saudi
arabia
the
world
s
largest
oil
exporter
is
the
only
major
producer
with
enough
spare
capacity
to
raise
output
quickly
balancing
supply
and
demand
the
kingdom
effectively
acts
as
the
oil
market
s
central
banker
its
thinking
and
action
on
supply
closely
watched
by
traders
at
the
moment
riyadh
is
gathering
data
and
has
not
decided
on
its
exact
course
of
action
for
next
year
if
iranian
supply
turns
out
tighter
than
anticipated
and
prices
rise
further
a
formal
production
increase
from
opec
and
allies
next
year
may
still
be
possible
and
will
be
discussed
at
a
meeting
on
the
two
sources
said
the
exact
additional
volumes
and
the
timeline
for
any
increase
would
depend
on
producers
compliance
with
their
current
output
agreement
in
coming
months
and
the
market
outlook
for
one
of
the
sources
said
the
reality
is
that
no
one
outside
saudi
arabia
can
raise
output
in
the
next
few
weeks
but
many
can
do
that
in
months
or
so
