austrian
fibers
producer
lenzing
will
focus
on
setting
up
a
new
production
facility
in
thailand
after
halting
its
planned
expansion
due
in
part
to
rising
trade
tensions
its
chief
executive
said
on
thursday
the
firm
which
makes
cellulose
fibers
used
in
textiles
said
late
wednesday
it
was
mothballing
a
million
project
in
alabama
partly
due
to
rising
tariffs
between
the
united
states
and
china
where
much
of
the
project
s
production
was
destined
stefan
doboczky
told
reuters
on
thursday
that
a
final
investment
decision
on
a
new
facility
in
thailand
would
be
made
in
a
few
months
thai
production
volumes
would
be
around
tons
per
year
roughly
the
same
as
initially
planned
for
the
new
plant
he
added
lenzing
is
expanding
internationally
and
announced
in
summer
last
year
that
it
planned
to
enter
the
thai
market
it
is
one
of
the
few
countries
that
have
free
trade
agreements
in
the
asean
association
of
southeast
asian
nations
region
as
well
as
with
china
and
india
doboczky
said
when
asked
why
the
new
focus
on
thailand
to
be
able
to
supply
customers
worldwide
is
extremely
important
in
our
chinese
textile
exports
to
the
united
states
now
face
a
percent
tariff
and
doboczky
said
it
was
possible
those
tariffs
might
increase
and
that
china
would
respond
with
our
assessment
is
that
products
such
as
our
lyocell
fiber
may
be
lyocell
a
fiber
produced
from
wood
is
one
of
the
group
s
lenzing
shares
closed
down
around
percent
on
thursday
doboczky
said
the
company
would
wait
until
there
was
clarity
regarding
tariffs
before
deciding
when
to
restart
the
project
he
also
wants
to
see
signs
that
the
local
jobs
market
is
easing
as
a
big
rise
in
labor
costs
was
another
reason
for
stopping
construction
at
the
alabama
site
it
is
our
clear
target
to
continue
building
the
site
and
to
push
the
start
button
again
at
the
right
the
ceo
said
he
did
not
expect
substantial
impairments
due
to
the
construction
halt
and
earnings
would
not
suffer
we
now
have
neither
a
profit
warning
for
neither
a
change
in
our
earnings
nor
do
we
face
a
he
said
lenzing
expects
earnings
to
be
lower
than
in
the
last
two
years
partly
due
to
increased
commodity
prices
and
strong
competition
on
the
fibers
market
