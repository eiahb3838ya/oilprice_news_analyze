gasoline
prices
are
sitting
at
seasonal
highs
headed
into
the
november
midterm
elections
even
as
president
donald
trump
has
called
repeatedly
for
opec
to
push
prices
lower
while
gasoline
prices
typically
drop
following
peak
summer
demand
season
they
have
not
fallen
as
fast
as
expected
said
jeanette
casselano
spokeswoman
for
the
american
automobile
association
the
national
price
average
was
at
a
gallon
as
of
wednesday
its
highest
seasonally
since
according
to
aaa
for
monthly
retail
gasoline
prices
see
fuel
prices
have
risen
due
to
a
surge
in
crude
oil
prices
crude
futures
have
gained
in
part
because
of
sanctions
affecting
iran
s
petroleum
sector
which
have
already
cut
into
that
nation
s
exports
according
to
market
participants
that
has
forced
others
including
saudi
arabia
and
russia
to
make
up
the
difference
the
price
of
global
benchmark
brent
hit
a
high
of
a
barrel
this
week
while
crude
hit
the
highest
since
july
the
sanctions
are
expected
to
take
supply
off
the
market
when
they
go
into
effect
in
november
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
ended
a
meeting
on
sunday
with
no
formal
recommendation
to
boost
output
increased
pressure
on
global
supply
could
cause
gasoline
prices
to
remain
at
current
levels
or
even
rise
this
fall
which
would
be
unusual
said
patrick
dehaan
head
of
petroleum
analysis
at
tracking
firm
gasbuddy
that
could
have
an
effect
on
voter
psyche
with
the
midterm
congressional
elections
approaching
the
absence
of
a
decline
at
the
pump
in
the
fall
could
be
notable
as
voters
head
to
the
polls
dehaan
said
yet
prices
might
not
be
high
enough
to
sway
voter
sentiment
consumers
do
not
usually
make
lifestyle
changes
until
prices
rise
to
a
gallon
or
more
casselano
said
wholesale
prices
have
risen
in
the
midwest
as
the
region
s
refineries
undergo
maintenance
dehaan
said
in
the
physical
market
gasoline
cash
differentials
in
group
three
a
region
that
encompasses
several
midwestern
states
rose
to
a
near
high
last
week
traders
said
for
group
three
cash
differentials
see
gasoline
inventories
are
at
seasonal
record
highs
which
could
help
temper
price
increases
said
bob
yawger
director
of
energy
futures
at
mizuho
for
gasoline
inventories
see
the
wide
discount
of
crude
to
brent
has
incentivized
refiners
to
make
gasoline
with
cheaper
crude
and
put
it
into
storage
for
later
sale
yawger
said

the
spread
