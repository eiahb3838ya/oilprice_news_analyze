update 2-eu won't impose immediate tariffs on cheap argentine biodiesel
paris
reuters
the
european
commission
has
decided
not
to
impose
provisional
import
tariffs
on
a
flood
of
argentine
biodiesel
until
it
gathers
more
information
although
it
considers
the
fuel
to
be
subsidised
and
a
potential
threat
to
local
producers
the
decision
detailed
in
a
document
seen
by
reuters
comes
as
a
major
blow
for
european
producers
of
fuels
made
from
vegetable
and
recycled
oil
they
have
been
hit
hard
since
the
eu
scrapped
duties
last
year
in
response
to
a
ruling
by
the
world
trade
organisation
the
commission
had
been
expected
to
reinstate
provisional
duties
this
month
or
in
october
and
argentine
sales
to
the
eu
had
stalled
in
anticipation
the
commission
s
preliminary
conclusions
are
that
the
argentinian
imports
of
the
product
concerned
into
the
union
are
subsidised
and
that
there
appears
to
be
a
threat
of
material
injury
to
the
union
industry
the
commission
said
in
the
document
however
the
commission
finds
it
necessary
to
collect
further
information
on
developments
after
the
investigation
period
which
could
further
confirm
the
commission
s
preliminary
findings
in
this
investigation
as
well
as
shed
more
light
on
the
union
interest
it
said
in
view
of
its
findings
the
commission
will
continue
the
investigation
without
the
imposition
of
provisional
the
commission
said
argentina
provided
support
to
its
industry
through
a
set
of
measures
including
export
duties
on
soybeans
a
biodiesel
feedstock
that
depressed
prices
to
an
artificially
low
level
to
the
advantage
of
the
downstream
biodiesel
industry
the
eu
s
removal
of
duties
on
biodiesel
from
argentina
and
indonesia
last
september
and
subsequent
surge
in
imports
has
forced
european
producers
to
cut
production
french
biodiesel
maker
saipol
the
eu
s
largest
producer
and
part
of
oilseed
group
avril
implemented
a
plan
to
reduce
production
in
march
blaming
huge
argentine
biodiesel
imports
for
exacerbating
poor
market
conditions
other
major
producers
such
as
bunge
and
archer
daniels
midland
co
announced
they
would
cut
output
or
close
plants
in
the
eu
according
to
argentina
s
official
statistics
agency
indec
the
country
has
exported
a
total
of
million
tonnes
of
biodiesel
in
as
of
of
which
more
than
tonnes
headed
to
the
eu
following
the
wto
ruling
the
european
biodiesel
board
ebb
launched
a
fresh
challenge
and
asked
the
eu
for
an
investigation
into
the
alleged
subsidies
which
was
formally
opened
in
january
the
final
decision
is
due
in
february
we
re
very
confident
that
this
subsidy
investigation
will
finish
in
the
same
way
without
any
kind
of
duty
for
argentina
which
we
believe
in
no
way
should
be
applied
