british
car
production
fell
by
an
annual
percent
in
august
the
third
consecutive
drop
in
a
row
due
to
model
changeovers
and
preparations
for
new
tougher
emissions
rules
a
car
industry
body
said
on
thursday
output
stood
at
units
last
month
driven
down
by
a
nearly
percent
drop
in
production
for
domestic
buyers
compared
with
a
percent
fall
in
exports
according
to
the
society
of
motor
manufacturers
and
traders
the
quieter
summer
months
are
often
subject
to
fluctuations
due
to
the
variable
timing
and
duration
of
annual
maintenance
and
shutdowns
said
chief
executive
mike
hawes
this
instability
was
exacerbated
in
august
with
the
industry
racing
to
recertify
entire
model
ranges
to
meet
tougher
testing
standards
in
force
on
september
the
tougher
new
worldwide
harmonised
light
vehicle
test
procedure
wltp
became
mandatory
from
the
start
of
september
forcing
certain
carmakers
to
halt
deliveries
and
change
plans
regarding
some
models
that
had
yet
to
have
for
emissions
the
car
industry
is
also
concerned
that
any
loss
of
free
and
unfettered
trade
after
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
next
year
could
hit
sales
and
output
especially
if
politicians
fail
to
strike
an
agreement
with
exports
the
majority
to
the
eu
continuing
to
drive
demand
it
underscores
the
importance
of
a
brexit
agreement
to
safeguard
this
trade
for
our
sector
no
deal
is
not
an
option
