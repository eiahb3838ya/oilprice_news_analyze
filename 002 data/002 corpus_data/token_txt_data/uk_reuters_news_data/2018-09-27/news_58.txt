u.s. stresses safety in talks on nuclear power with saudi arabia -perry
washington
reuters
the
united
states
is
close
to
working
with
saudi
arabia
on
building
nuclear
power
reactors
but
talks
on
tough
standards
with
the
kingdom
remain
a
challenge
energy
secretary
rick
perry
said
on
wednesday
perry
has
held
talks
with
several
saudi
leaders
this
year
including
king
salman
and
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
on
the
kingdom
s
ambition
of
initially
building
two
nuclear
power
stations
saudi
arabia
wants
to
ultimately
construct
reactors
in
coming
decades
at
a
cost
of
about
billion
billion
pounds
discussions
had
been
held
up
on
saudi
arabia
s
desire
to
relax
nonproliferation
standards
and
potentially
allow
the
country
to
enrich
uranium
and
reprocess
plutonium
technologies
that
advocates
worry
could
one
day
be
covertly
altered
to
produce
fissile
material
for
nuclear
weapons
perry
said
progress
on
standards
had
been
made
but
that
talks
were
not
going
as
quickly
as
either
side
would
have
hoped
perry
has
shared
with
saudi
leaders
that
being
perceived
as
very
very
strong
on
was
a
most
important
message
globally
he
told
reporters
at
the
energy
department
headquarters
perry
said
part
of
the
talks
centre
on
making
sure
any
nuclear
inspections
would
not
be
intrusive
for
sensitive
areas
in
the
kingdom
in
july
south
korea
said
its
utility
kepco
along
with
the
united
states
france
china
and
russia
had
been
shortlisted
to
bid
for
a
nuclear
power
project
in
saudi
arabia
and
that
the
winner
would
likely
be
selected
in
washington
hopes
saudi
arabia
will
buy
nuclear
power
technology
from
companies
including
westinghouse
which
recently
emerged
from
chapter
bankruptcy
and
abandoned
plans
to
build
two
advanced
reactors
in
the
united
states
if
saudi
arabia
signs
a
deal
that
relaxes
the
safeguards
the
united
arab
emirates
could
be
free
to
break
a
deal
it
signed
with
washington
years
ago
and
enrich
uranium
the
uae
deal
contained
the
gold
standard
in
such
nuclear
agreements
because
it
contained
safeguards
against
enriching
and
preprocessing
westinghouse
said
it
would
defer
to
the
customer
saudi
arabia
for
comment
the
saudi
embassy
in
washington
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
