coal

continues
to
fall

from

in
marginally
below

the
lowest

power
producers
generated
almost
percent
less
electricity
from
coal
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
even
as
total

rose
almost
percent

down

gigawatts

coal
consumption
is
unlikely

will
probably
continue
to
decline
in
the
next
few
years
most
power
plants
still
in

were
commissioned
in
the
and
when
surging
oil
prices
caused
a
shift
from

generation
most
are
now
years
old
and
as
a
result
of
corrosion
and
fatigue
require
expensive
replacements
of
steam
generators
and
other
large
pieces
of
equipment
ageing
power
plants
also
suffer
from
rising
operation
and
maintenance
costs
increased
outages
reduced
reliability
and
reduced
thermal
efficiency
retrofitting
them
to
comply
with
tougher
pollution
controls
adds
to
the
financial
burden
of
keeping
them
in

though
in
many
cases
is
not
the
major
reason
why
they
struggle
to
compete
by
contrast
units
are
faster
and
cheaper
to
build
cause
less
pollution
and
can
start
up
and
ramp
down
quickly
so
they
are
more
flexible
and
better
suited
to
following
daily
changes
in
power
consumption
technology
and
economics
rather
than
government
regulations
are
driving
the
shift
away
from
coal
and
towards
generation
power
plants
have
been
losing
market
share
for
years
with
their
share
of
total
generation
falling
from
a
peak

percent

until
overall
growth
in
electricity
consumption
enabled

generation
to
increase
in
absolute
terms
even
as
coal
went
into
relative
decline
since
then
however
power
demand
has
flattened
while
generation
has
continued
to

ensuring
that
electricity
generation
has
been
steadily
declining
in
absolute
as
well
as
relative

the
shale
revolution
has
entrenched
the
shift
from
coal
to
gas
by
making
gas
supplies
plentiful
and
keeping
prices
low
and
relatively
stable
coal
s
major
advantage
over
gas
was
traditionally
its
lower
price
and
volatility
but
the
fall
in
gas
prices
and
increasing
efficiency
of
power
plants
has
removed
even
this
benefit
low
gas
prices
now
hit
the
number
of
hours
that
units
run
and
ultimately
the
number
of
coal
units
that
remain
in
service
as
they
become
increasingly
old
as
the
remaining
capacity
of
power
plants
falls
coal
consumption
will
continue
to

medium
term

the
federal
government
steps
in
to
ensure
power

run
