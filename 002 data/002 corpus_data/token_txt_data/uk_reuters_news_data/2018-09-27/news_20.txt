oil
edged
higher
on
thursday
driven
by
the
prospect
of
a
shortfall
in
global
supply
once
sanctions
against
major
crude
exporter
iran
come
into
force
in
five
weeks
president
donald
trump
this
week
demanded
that
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
raise
production
to
prevent
further
price
rises
ahead
of
midterm
elections
in
november
for
congress
members
the
market
continues
to
move
higher
on
fears
that
the
loss
of
iranian
exports
is
not
going
to
be
made
up
said
gene

connecticut
analysts
said
that
opec
and
russia
appear
unlikely
to
immediately
boost
production
as
trump
has
demanded

secretary
rick
perry
has
ruled
out
using
strategic
crude

to
lower

futures
settled
up

at

on
paper
you
could
argue
that
the
technical
and
fundamental
perspective
points
to
higher
prices
so
i
think
that
will
carry
on
into
next
week
and
further
out

senior
manager
ole
hansen
said

hansen
said
he
was
struggling
to
see
the
price
reaching
a
barrel
already
at
we
are
seeing
local
oil
prices
pretty
close
to
where
we
peaked
a
few
years
ago
the
race
to
protect
consumers
from
further
price
rises
from
here
could
potentially
impact
demand
growth
sooner
than
would
otherwise
have
been
expected

said
in
a
note
to
clients
that
market
risks
are
heavily
skewed
to
the
upside
and
whilst
we
are
not
explicitly
forecasting
brent
to
rise
to
per
barrel
we
see
material
risks
of
this

widely
on
how
much
iranian

could
remove
from
the

consumption
saudi
arabia
will
quietly
add
extra
oil
to
the
market
in
coming
months
to
offset
a
drop
in
iranian
production
but
is
worried
it
might
need
to
limit
output
next

the
