asian
shares
held
firm
on
thursday
outperforming
sagging
wall
street
shares
and
bond
yields
fell
after
the
federal
reserve
raised
interest
rates
as
expected
sticking
to
its
script
of
gradual
policy
tightening
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside

rose
percent
with
south
korea
s
kospi
hitting
highs
japan
s
nikkei
briefly
touched
an
high
as
automakers
rose
after
the
united
states
indicated
it
would
not
impose
further
tariffs
on
japanese
automotive
products
for
now
though
it
was
down
percent
at
midday
in
choppy
trade
on
the
whole
asia
fared
batter
than
wall
street
where
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
fell
percent
and
the
s
p
lost
percent
the
nasdaq
composite
dropped
percent
the
treasuries
yield
fell
more
than
basis
points
to
percent
as
market
participants
had
been
braced
for
a
more
hawkish
stance
the
fall
in
treasury
yields
was
good
news
for
asia
and
other
emerging
markets
which
had
been
pressured
by
concerns
that
higher
yields
would
encourage
investors
to
move
funds
out
of
emerging
markets
to
the
united
states
on
top
of
worries
over
the
trade
feud
the
fed
bumped
up
its
policy
target
by
a
quarter
of
a
percentage
point
to
percent
and
indicated
that
it
foresees
another
rate
rise
in
december
three
more
next
year
and
one
in
that
was
little
changed
from
its
june
projections
the
fed
s
projected
hikes
will
put
the
benchmark
overnight
lending
rate
at
percent
by
roughly
half
a
percentage
point
above
the
fed
s
estimated
neutral
rate
of
interest
the
fed
seems
to
have
grown
more
convinced
of
the
need
to
keep
raising
rates
beyond
neutral
levels
i
can
not
see
reasons
to
slow
down
raising
rates
as
long
as
the
jobless
rate
keeps
falling
said
tomoaki
shishido
fixed
income
strategist
at
nomura
securities
the
fed
also
dropped
a
reference
in
its
statement
to
the
word
accommodative
although
chairman
jerome
powell
later
said
policy
was
still
accommodative
he
also
said
the
fed
didn
t
have
any
precise
understanding
of
when
policy
would
be
neutral
some
investors
see
a
limited
need
for
the
fed
to
keep
raising
rates
as
inflation
has
shown
no
sign
of
picking
up
so
far
despite
continued
economic
growth
and
a
tight
labour
market
the
unemployment
rate
stood
near
its
lowest
level
since
three
hikes
next
year
is
absurd
said
bob
baur
chief
global
economist
at
principal
global
investors
in
des
moines
iowa
with
an
additional
rate
hike
likely
in
and
one
in
march
next
year
we
will
reach
what
many
fed
governors
feel
is
a
neutral
rate
level
with
the
low
odds
of
a
spike
in
inflation
it
makes
sense
that
the
fed
would
pause
after
the
march
rate
hike
and
allow
the
markets
to
adjust
to
its
new
policy
he
said
adding
more
uncertainty
to
the
economic
outlook
were
trade
disputes
between
the
trump
administration
and
several
trading
partners
tariffs
and
retaliatory
levies
by
others
could
slow
the
global
economic
growth
but
tariffs
could
also
stoke
inflation
by
raising
the
prices
of
imported
goods
a
boost
to
the
economy
from
trump
s
tax
cuts
looks
set
to
wane
next
year
raising
more
doubts
on
the
view
that
the
economy
could
retain
strength
beyond
next
year
in
the
currency
market
the
dollar
was
mixed
after
the
fed
s
decision
the
dollar
index
against
a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
stood
at
having
gained
percent
on
wednesday
it
hovered
above
friday
s
low
of
the
euro
traded
at
off
high
of
touched
on
monday
the
yen
hit
a
low
of
to
the
dollar
in
a
choppy
trade
after
the
fed
s
policy
announcement
but
it
bounced
back
to
emerging
market
currencies
were
firmer
with
msci
s
emerging
market
currency
index
rising
percent
on
wednesday
and
another
percent
in
asia
on
thursday
these
gains
have
sent
up
the

by
percent
raising
hopes
it
could
post
its
first
monthly
rise
in
six
