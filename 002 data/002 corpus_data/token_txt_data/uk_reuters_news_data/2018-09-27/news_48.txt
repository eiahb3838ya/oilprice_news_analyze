look
into
trading

after

completes
the

a
senior

danske
commodities
one
of
denmark

largest
commodity
traders
agreed
in
july
to
a
takeover
by
norwegian
oil
firm
equinor
pending
regulatory
approval
danske
has
a
trading
model
that
can
be
exported
to
any

where
there
is

for
power
trading
tor
martin
anfinnsen
equinor
s
senior
vice
president
for
marketing
and
trading
told
reuters
this
week
there
is
a
high
probability
that
their
competence
will
also
be
applied
by
us
in
some
of
the
asian
markets
he
said
they
have
just
established
themselves
in
australia
but
there
s
no
reason
it
will
not
go
beyond
australia
anfinnsen
added
but
declined
to
specify
which
markets
the
company
has
in
mind
danske
commodities
operates
in
countries
but
it
has
recently
reduced
its
trading
position
on
nasdaq
s
nordic
power
exchange
after
one
trader
s
default
left
a
million
euro
million
hole
in
nasdaq
s
clearing
house
buffers
the
danske
acquisition
comes
as
equinor
is
ramping
up
investments
in
renewable
energy
especially
offshore
wind
projects
the
company
plans
to
spend
percent
to
percent
of
its
capital
expenditures
on
renewables
diversifying
its
oil
and
gas
portfolio
equinor
will
open
a
new
office
in
tokyo
later
this
week
and
its
first
office
in
india
by
early
next
year
as
it
expands
its
presence
in
asia
we
are
changing
as
a
company
nevertheless
for
the
foreseeable
future
oil
and
gas
will
still
dominate
our
agenda
anfinnsen
said
equinor
sees
a
risk
to
upside
for
oil
prices
as
supply
from
iran
venezuela
nigeria
and
libya
has
tightened
and
the
company
is
quite
bullish
about
economic
growth
next
year
despite
headwinds
from
emerging
economies
and
the
trade
war
its
executives
said
not
many
companies
are
expected
to
be
given
waivers
if
any
around
sanctions
on
iran
there
is
certainly
a
bullish
upward
momentum
said
simon
james
the
company
s
vice
president
crude
and
refining
equinor
has
exported
three
of
its
four
condensate
grades
in
recent
months
to
asia
as
buyers
of
iranian
condensate
sought
replacements
james
said
these
include
snohvit
and
ormen
lange
from
the
north
sea
algerian
condensate
and
eagle
ford
we
wish
we
have
access
to
more
it
looks
tight
right
now
