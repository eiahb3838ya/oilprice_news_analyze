danske

head
of
power
markets
told
reuters
without
giving
a
value
for
its
total
position
depending
on
how
liquidity
on
the
market
evolves
we
may
downsize
it
the
biggest
liquidity
provider
aas
defaulted
and
that
created
a
lot
of
illiquid
products
he
added
we
can
t
leave
a
big
position
in
the
market
we
need
to
close
it
we
need
to
size
down
our
mandate
on
danske
commodities
trades
on
nasdaq
s
nordic
commodities
exchange
to
hedge
against
german
power
prices
which
it
trades
on
nasdaq

rival
exchange
eex
we
use
eex
in
all
our
german
products
if
liquidity
picks
up
in
its
nordic
products
we
will
follow
and
quit
nasdaq
we
will
not
be
the
first
movers
but
we
will
follow
said
mosegaard
nasdaq
declined
to
comment
on
danske
commodities
decision
reuters
contacted
more
than
twenty
companies
a
majority
of
which
said
they
expected
liquidity
to
decrease
further
as
a
result
of
aas
default
and
the
higher
collateral
they
are
now
asked
to
pay
i
know
that
liquidity
is
gone
it
increases
the
risk
in
swings
in
the
market
if
you
want
to
get
out
of
the
market
you
can

the

firm
by
number
of
customers
and
denmark

ewii
which
posted
revenues
of

euros
last
year
said
they
would
soon
decide
whether
to
stop
clearing
power
trades
via
nasdaq
they
will
continue
to
use
nasdaq
to
trade
nordic
power
contracts
but
could
use
banks
instead
of
nasdaq
s
clearing
house
for
that
function
the
clearing
house
which
is
run
by
nasdaq
to
ensure
that

a

at
eidsiva
energi
told
reuters
oliver
wolgast
ewii
s
senior
director
for
renewables
trading

said
the
company
would
decide
within
a
few
weeks
whether
to
leave
nasdaq
s
clearing
house
quitting
as
a
direct
clearing
member
and
going
to
clear
through
banks
is
on
the
table
after
what
happened
he
said
nasdaq
said
it
continued
to
have
an
open
dialogue
with
the
members
of
its
nordic
clearing
house
nasdaq
has
been
supporting
a
general
clearing
model
for
our
commodities
market
for
many
years
and
we
support
any
member
s
decisions
to
change
their
clearing
model
said
a
nasdaq
spokesman
rival
trading
platform
eex
is
the
dominant
exchange
in
european
power
markets
and
stands
to
benefit
other
exchanges
include
cme
and
ice
after
what
happened
with
aas
a
number
of
members
of
nasdaq
asked
for
information
to
join
or
increase
their
position
with
eex
eex
s
nordics
chief
heine
roenningen
said
six
traders
told
reuters
they
were
considering
joining
or
trading
more
on
eex
five
declined
to
be
named
as
the
topic
is
sensitive
three
of
the
six
traders
already
had
an
account
with
eex
and
could
increase
trading
there
while
the
other
three
said
they
may
join
eex
and
move
most
if
not
all
of
their
activity
there
to
reduce
risk
and
restore
trust
after
aas
default
nasdaq
raised
initial
margin
levels
and
said
it
was
considering
lowering
the
maximum
allowed
positions
in
the
nordics
the
estimated
margin
level
on
a
nordic
power
year
contract
was
around
percent
and
is
percent
now
for
german
power
the
margin
levels
were
percent
before
and
percent
after
nasdaq
said
trading
firms
who
already
clear
through
banks
said
they
expected
banks
to
raise
their
fees
as
a
result
of
the
firms
losses
and
the
higher
collateral
they
are
now
asked
to
post
seb
and
abn
amro
which
clear
trades
with
nasdaq
told
reuters
they
were
considering
the
possibility
of
raising
their
fees
among
other
options
we
will
have
a
discussion
with
the
members
clearing
through
us
and
nasdaq
one
possible
outcome
after
assessing
the
risk
could
be
raising
the
cost
of
clearing
fees
