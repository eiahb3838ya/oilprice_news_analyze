europe
s
share
markets
and
the
euro
both
took
a
tumble
on
thursday
as
reports
that
italy
s
budget
was
facing
a
delay
compounded
an
already
groggy
global
mood
after
the
third
interest
rate
rise
of
the
year
italy
s
main
milan
bourse
slumped
as
much
as
percent
with
the
country
s
big
banks
down
even
more
as
the
country
s
borrowing
costs
also
hit
a
high
in
the
government
bond
markets
investors
have
been
anxious
about
italy
s
budget
which
some
fear
could
lead
to
a
blowout
of
the
country
s
deficit
and
put
the
coalition
government
on
a
collision
course
with
the
european
union
rome
confirmed
that
a
cabinet
meeting
over
budget
targets
was
still
planned
for
later
dismissing
an
earlier
report
in
the
corriere
della
sera
newspaper
that
it
could
be
delayed
but
it
couldn
t
soothe
the
markets
especially
after
the
economy
ministry
was
forced
to
deny
its
chief
giovanni
tria
an
academic
who
doesn
t
belong
to
any
one
party
had
threatened
to
resign
it
is
very
fluid
and
it
is
changing
by
the
minute
it
seems
head
of
emea
macro
strategy
at
state
street
tim
graf
said
even
if
things
get
resolved
positively
today
italy
is
not
a
situation
that
is
going
to
go
away
he
added
pointing
to
the
growing
popularity
of
the
country
s
fractious
coalition
government
the
strains
weighed
on
the
rest
of
europe
too
with
the
stoxx
still
in
the
red
despite
an
attempted
rebound
and
the
euro
down
percent
in
the
currency
markets
having
skidded
all
the
way
down
to
that
fall
also
gave
the
dollar
a
boost
after
it
had
only
managed
a
lazy
gain
after
the
federal
reserve
hiked
interest
rates
on
wednesday
by
another
basis
points
to
a
range
of
percent
to
percent
the
dollar
index
which
measures
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
currencies
was
last
up
percent
to
the
index
had
scaled
a
high
in
drawing
demand
as
trade
tensions
buffeted
riskier
emerging
market
currencies
the
index
has
since
fallen
about
percent
though
as
investors
have
become
more
nuanced
in
their
views
fed
ratesetters
still
see
another
rate
hike
in
december
three
more
next
year
and
one
increase
in
wall
street
futures
pointed
to
a
broadly
steady
start
having
largely
expected
the
move
with
traders
also
getting
the
taste
for
apple
again
after
jp
morgan
started
coverage
of
the
iphone
giant
with
an
overweight
buy
rating
the
australian
dollar
seen
as
a
barometer
of
global
investor
risk
appetite
and
chinese
demand
fell
percent
to
its
lowest
since
and
not
far
off
its
year
lows
of
hit
earlier
this
month
overnight
msci
s
index
of
shares
outside
japan
had
ended
lower
there
were
however
pockets
of
resilience
such
as
south
korea
s
kospi
which
hit
highs
as
it
resumed
trade
after
a
public
holiday
japan
s
nikkei
briefly
touched
an
high
too
as
signs
that
the
united
states
may
not
impose
further
tariffs
on
japanese
automotive
products
for
now
lifted
carmakers
though
the
index
eventually
ended
down
percent
with
the
fed
s
steady
message
still
fresh
in
the
mind
treasuries
yields
fell
to
percent
from
tuesday
s
high
of
percent
when
traders
had
been
expecting
a
more
hawkish
signal
for
the
central
bank
fomc
members
did
drop
a
description
of
its
policy
stance
as
accommodative
but
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
then
downplayed
the
significance
of
the
change
at
a
news
conference
saying
rates
were
still
generally
accommodative
falling
treasury
yields
were
good
news
for
emerging
markets
plenty
of
em
currencies
were
firmer
despite
the
dollar
s
broader
gains
against
the
likes
of
the
euro
turkey
s
lira
was
back
up
to
per
dollar
for
the
first
time
in
almost
two
week
despite
data
showing
that
confidence
among
businesses
had
seen
its
biggest
month
on
month
slump
in
a
almost
decade
em
currencies
have
been
pressured
for
months
by
concerns
that
higher
yields
would
encourage
investors
to
move
funds
out
of
those
economies
back
into
the
that

on
top
of
worries
over
the
trade
feud

the
philippino
finance

warned
the
world

be

if
the
current
trade
war
drags

the

its
rates
for
a
fourth
straight
meeting
on
thursday
in
an
effort
to
stem
the
slide
in
its
currency
rising
oil
prices
are
another
major
pressure

for
energy
