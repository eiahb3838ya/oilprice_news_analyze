plans
on
how
they
will
deal
with
complaints
and
provide
appropriate
updates
the
survey
of
around
complainants
carried
out
every
two
years
found
that
satisfaction
has
improved
since
the
last
survey
in
with
a
third
percent
of
domestic
customers
satisfied
with
how
their
complaint
was
dealt
with
an
increase

five

points
from

said
however
it
also
found
that
the
proportion
of
customers
who
are
dissatisfied
percent
remains
higher
than
those
satisfied
with
how
their
complaint
had
been
dealt
with
the
main
reasons
for
dissatisfaction
were
the
length
of
time
taken
to
resolve
an
issue
not
being
kept
up
to
date
with
the
progress
of
the
complaint
and
suppliers
not
providing
complainants
with
a
clear
idea
of
how
long
a
resolution
would
take
although
the
level
of
satisfaction
about
complaint
handling
has
increased
over
the
past
two
years
it
is
still
unacceptably
low
