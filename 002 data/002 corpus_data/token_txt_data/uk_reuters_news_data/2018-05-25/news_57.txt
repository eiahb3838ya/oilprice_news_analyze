chinese, others clamor for crude exports, but u.s. straining capacity
new
york
may
reuters
the
oil
export
infrastructure
is
straining
to
keep
up
as
the
country
s
crude
oil
exports
hit
new
highs
and
china
snaps
up
more
of
it
than
ever
before
crude
production
has
surged
to
a
record
million
barrels
a
day
driven
largely
by
growth
from
the
permian
shale
patch
in
west
texas
which
pumps
more
than
million
bpd
however
the
infrastructure
to
move
it
abroad
is
lagging
even
as
prices
are
well
below
the
brent
benchmark
a
discount
that
sits
just
off
highs
at
per
barrel
crude
exports
peaked
at
million
bpd
two
weeks
ago
but
are
expected
to
keep
rising
no
definitive
data
are
available
on
how
much
crude
the
united
states
can
export
though
analysts
estimate
a
nationwide
capacity
of
million
to
million
bpd
most
terminal
operators
and
companies
do
not
disclose
capacity
and
the
energy
department
does
not
track
it
so
far
export
capacity
is
keeping
pace
but
we
are
walking
a
tightrope
said
bernadette
johnson
vice
president
at
drillinginfo
that
capacity
may
begin
to
be
tested
next
month
as
sinopec
asia
s
largest
refiner
bought
a
record
million
barrels
or
about
bpd
of
crude
to
load
in
june
two
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
on
wednesday
for
the
last
six
months
of
available
data
ending
in
february
the
united
states
only
exported
about
bpd
to
china
analysts
are
concerned
about
how
quickly
the
crude
terminals
at
gulf
coast
ports
many
initially
designed
for
imports
can
shift
to
handling
exports
only
the
louisiana
offshore
oil
port
can
handle
supertanker
exports
but
it
only
started
testing
in
february
the
supertankers
known
as
vlccs
or
very
large
crude
carriers
can
handle
some
million
barrels
of
oil
the
amount
preferred
by
asian
buyers
with
bigger
ports
there
s
only
one
dock
on
the
gulf
coast
that
can
handle
a
vlcc
deepwater
and
that
s
loop
and
the
loop
has
only
started
to
export
said
sandy
fielden
director
of
research
in
commodities
and
energy
at
morningstar
port
of
corpus
christi
in
texas
is
developing
its
harbor
island
port
which
will
accommodate
vlccs
per
year
said
jarl
pedersen
chief
commercial
officer
at
the
port
with
a
targeted
completion
of
late
kpler
a
cargo
tracking
service
on
thursday
estimated
that
up
to
million
bpd
can
be
moved
from
the
top
ports
of
corpus
christi
houston
port
arthur
and
new
orleans
their
estimate
in
october
was
million
bpd
pira
energy
group
put
the
overall
crude
export
capacity
at
million
bpd
while
morningstar
s
estimate
is
million
bpd
at
most
in
addition
to
port
constraints
inadequate
pipeline
space
has
created
a
glut
of
supply
in
west
texas
pushing
the
principle
cash
grade
there
to
a
discount
to
benchmark
crude
futures
this
month
the
biggest
in
years
the
constraint
is
really
the
pipeline
coming
down
from
the
permian
to
corpus
christi
said
pedersen
however
the
ship
channel
still
needs
to
be
deepened
a
million
project
in
development
with
the
army
corps
