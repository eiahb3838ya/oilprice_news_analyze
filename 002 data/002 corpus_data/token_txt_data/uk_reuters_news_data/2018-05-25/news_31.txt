world
shares
steadied
and
the
dollar
resumed
its
rise
on
friday
after
a
wobble
caused
by
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
cancel
a
summit
with
north
korea
though
political
risk
put
italian
markets
on
track
for
heavy
weekly
losses
markets
were
soothed
somewhat
by
the
pyongyang
s
measured
response
to
trump
s
announcement
with
vice
foreign
minister
kim
kye
gwan
expressing
hope
for
a
trump
formula
to
resolve
the
standoff
over
its
nuclear
programme
north

tensions
aside
markets
appetite
for
risk
was
kept
in
check
by
concern
over
italy

opposing
the
incoming

s
plan
to
appoint
a
politically
inexperienced

msci
s
equity
index
was
flat
after
three
days
of
losses
which
put
it
on
track
for
its
second
straight
week
in
the

while
asian
equities
also
eked
out

the
seoul
index
pared
falls
of
almost
one
percent
to
trade
down
percent
and
the
korean
won
also
firmed
percent
to
the

but
despite
thursday
s
wall
street
declines
there
were
no
immediate
signs
of
a
broad

s

index
ending
at
a
low
market
reaction
to
heightened
political
risk
remains
reasonably
muted
if
they
are
not
global
events
affecting
large
swathes
of
countries
in
a
major
way
the
calculation
is
that
the
impact
will
be

global
head
of
economic
research
marie
owens
thomsen
said
she
cited
the
example
of
turkey
and
italy
where
a
stock
and
bond
has
not
spilled
much
into
other
emerging
economies
or
peripheral
euro
zone
states
such
as
spain
or
portugal
european
shares
opened
firmer
but
looked
set
for
their
first
weekly
drop
since
march
pressured
by
the
italy
worries
and
signs
the
euro
bloc
s
economic
recovery
continues
to
run
out
of
steam
italian
stocks
which
saw
record
outflows
in
the
past
week
fell
percent
and
were
set
for
their
third
straight
week
of
losses
european

shares
which
fell
heavily
after
trump
mooted
possible
tariff
increases
on
imported
cars
bounced
after
the
comments
drew
criticism
from
business
groups
and
members
of
his
own
party
however
worry
about
italy
kept
the
euro
under
pressure
it
fell
percent
against
the
dollar
putting
it
on
track
for
the
sixth
straight
week
of
losses
while
the
swiss
franc
traditionally
seen
as
a
is
set
for
a
fourth
consecutive
weekly
gain
against
the
single
currency
also
on
the
upside
the
dollar
rebounded
percent
after
touching
lows
versus
a
basket
of
currencies
on
thursday
however
it
held
under
this
week
s
highs
the
yen
another
currency
deemed
to
be
a
asset
slipped
percent
against
the
dollar
reversing
gains
seen
after
the
summit
cancellation
the
euro
continues
to
be
under
pressure
especially
against
the
franc
as
spreads
are
widening
but
markets
are
taking
a
approach
for
now
societe
generale
strategist
alvin
tan
said
referring
to
the
premium
investors
demand
to
hold
italian
bonds
compared
with
safer
german
bunds
the
spread
on
respective
bonds
widened
on
friday
to
basis
points

having
widened

this
week
german

about
bps

treasuries
where
yields
touched
near
lows
on
thursday
for
europe
another
potential
headache
are
signs
its
growth
recovery
is
running
out
of
steam
some
relief
on
this
front
was
provided
by
germany
s
ifo
business
confidence
index
which
held
steady
this
month
after
falling
for
five
straight
months
however
this
week

indicated

rises
in

would
have
been
a
bigger
problem
than
cancellation
of
the

senior
strategist
yukino
yamada
said
worries
that
investors
could
shift
assets
from
emerging
markets
to
bonds
have
been
a
major
headwind
for
emerging
markets
this
year
among
them
turkey
has
been
the
worst
hit
over
concerns
about
the
central
bank
s
ability
to
tame
inflation
because
of
political
pressure
from
president
tayyip
erdogan
a
enemy
of

of
