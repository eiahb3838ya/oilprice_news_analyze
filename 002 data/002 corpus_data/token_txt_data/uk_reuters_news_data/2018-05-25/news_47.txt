filling
the
fuel
tank
for
vacation
driving
this
summer
will
be
pricier
than
it
has
been
in
nearly
four
years
for
american
motorists
as
gasoline
prices
nationwide
rise
toward
the
expected
average
seasonal
price
of
a
gallon
consumers
could
be
most
likely
to
rethink
their
driving
habits
as
pump
prices
rise
the
american
automobile
association
said
prices
ease
as
the
peak
summer
season
ends
around
september
aaa
said
but
they
could
remain
at
seasonal
highs
not
seen
since
for
consumers
who
have
constrained
budgets
they
won
t
be
able
to
cope
with
the
additional
shock
to
their
household
budget
after
a
certain
point
said
devin
gladden
a
spokesperson
for
aaa
this
could
crimp
total
gasoline
demand
which
has
risen
for
five
straight
years
even
though
the
current
price
level
does
not
approach
when
the
average
gallon
topped
on
the
eve
of
the
long
memorial
day
holiday
weekend
that
kicks
off
summer
driving
season
analysts
do
not
expect
gasoline
demand
to
suffer
much
as
of
yet
the
energy
information
administration
expects
gasoline
consumption
to
be
unchanged
in
from
as
population
and
employment
growth
supports
demand
said
tim
hess
a
product
manager
for
the
eia
s
energy
outlook
global
benchmark
brent
crude
oil
futures
have
surged
nearly
percent
over
the
last
year
as
demand
has
risen
sharply
while
production
has
been
restricted
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
other
major
exporters
this
past
week
brent
topped
a
barrel
for
the
first
time
since
and
the
gasoline
futures
contract
on
the
new
york
mercantile
exchange
hit
its
highest
since
october
whether
that
starts
to
pinch
consumer
spending
depends
on
how
long
prices
remain
elevated
according
to
bank
of
lynch
economists
the
investment
bank
in
a
note
last
week
said
a
sustained
increase
in
oil
to
or
a
barrel
would
have
a
more
pronounced
effect
on
economic
growth
than
a
temporary
spike
as
of
thursday
the
average
gasoline
price
was
a
gallon
nationwide
according
to
aaa
compared
with
a
year
ago
the
average
exceeds
a
gallon
in
states
up
from
just
states
two
weeks
ago
prices
for
gasoline
have
already
affected
some
consumer
spending
habits
retail
sales
increased
marginally
in
april
as
rising
gasoline
prices
cut
into
discretionary
spending
consumers
could
respond
to
higher
prices
by
combining
trips
to
the
grocery
store
or
carpooling
said
matthew
lewis
an
associate
professor
of
economics
at
clemson
university
however
much
of
gasoline
demand
is
inelastic
lewis
said
people
will
cut
back
but
not
that
much
which
means
they
re
still
driving
a
lot
and
they
re
paying
more
to
do
it
lewis
said
adding
that
for
a
percent
gasoline
price
increase
demand
typically
drops
only
about
to
percent
however
people
who
buy
gasoline
for
the
physical
market
have
become
more
cautious
about
demand
a
products
trader
said
cash
prices
for
gulf
coast
gasoline
a
grade
that
often
reflects
the
domestic
market
have
fallen
about
cents
per
gallon
below
the
futures
contract
on
nymex
in
the
past
week
