oil
prices
eased
on
friday
as
russia
hinted
it
may
gradually
increase
output
after
withholding
supplies
since
together
with
producer
cartel
opec
brent
crude
futures
were
at
per
barrel
at
gmt
down
cent
from
their
last
close
but
more
than
percent
below
the
november
high
they
reached
on
may
brent
broke
through
for
the
first
time
in
a
few
years
earlier
in
may
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
futures
were
at
a
barrel
down
cents
from
their
last
settlement
oil
prices
are
now
starting
to
drift
a
little
said
greg
mckenna
chief
market
strategist
at
futures
brokerage
axitrader
adding
that
this
was
due
to
opec
s
and
russia
s
moves
toward
an
increase
in
production
at
the
june
meeting
the
middle
east
dominated
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
as
well
as
a
group
of
producers
led
by
russia
started
withholding
output
in
to
tighten
the
market
and
prop
up
prices
but
russia
in
particular
has
been
floating
a
potential
end
to
the
production
cuts
with
energy
minister
alexander
novak
saying
on
thursday
that
restrictions
on
oil
production
could
be
eased
softly
if
opec
and
countries
see
the
oil
market
balancing
in
june
the
russians
have
always
struck
me
as
production
cut
tourists
keen
to
get
off
the
boat
and
crank
up
production
as
soon
as
inventories
were
stabilised
and
prices
once
again
elevated
that
possibility
is
top
of
the
mind
for
traders
and
as
a
result
oil
prices
are
slipping
