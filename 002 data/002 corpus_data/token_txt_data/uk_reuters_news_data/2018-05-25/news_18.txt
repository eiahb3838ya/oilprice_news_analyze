with
italy

turmoil
oil
prices
on
the
rise
and
north
korea
tensions
back
on
the
burner
the
last
thing
the
global
economy
needs
is
a
big
lurch
towards
a
trade
war
further
clouding
the
outlook
but
that
is
exactly
what
the
trump
administration
faces
if
it
does
not
extend
temporary
exemptions
on
steel
and
aluminium
imports
from
europe
that
expire
on
thursday
the
europeans
have
opportunities
for
last
minute
diplomacy
when
the
organisation
for
economic
cooperation
and
development
holds
its
annual
ministerial
council
in
paris
on
wednesday
for
his
part
french
president
emmanuel
macron
is
to
due
to
make
the
case
for
breathing
new
life
into
the
international
economic
order
in
a
speech
before
the
oecd
on
wednesday
but
there
are
few
signs
of
appetite
for
that
ahead
of
talks
between
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
and
eu
trade
chief
ceclia
malmstrom
on
the
sidelines
of
the
oecd
meeting
the
question
is
how
can
we
accept
a
situation
where
the
americans
manage
their
dialogue
with
a
rival
like
china
the
same
way
as
with
their
allies
without
special
treatment
for
being
a
ally
a
senior
french
diplomat
said
even
before
trump
raised
the
spectre
of
import
tariffs
trade
flows
faced
an
increasing
number
restrictions
as
economies
struggled
to
get
back
on
their
feet
following
the
global
financial
crisis
of
economies
have
put
up
new
trade
restrictions
over
the
last
decade
against
only
liberalisation
measures
during
the
same
period
according
to
an
oecd
tally
oecd
chief
angel
gurria
said
some
governments
were
blaming
globalisation
and
by
extension
the
broader
multilateral
trading
system
rather
than
fixing
bad
policies
that
have
failed
to
address
voters
concerns
about
jobs
going
overseas
globalisation
does
not
have
a
face
globalisation
does
not
have
a
neck
from
which
you
can
hang
it
so
you
use
a
proxy
the
closest
proxy
is
multilateralism
gurria
told
journalists
there
is
little
prospect
for
a
quick
fix
in
the
trade
standoff
between
washington
and
its
allies
after
the
trump
administration
opened
a
new
front
on
wednesday
by
also
threatening
tariffs
on
auto
imports
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
will
likely
take
flak
over
trade
threats
from
his
counterparts
from
other
members
of
the
group
of
seven
economies
when
they
meet
in
the
canadian
rocky
mountains
on
friday
and
saturday
the
prospect
of
a
trade
war
is
particularly
a
concern
in
europe
where
the
economy
is
already
losing
steam
complicating
the
european
central
bank
s
return
to
more
conventional
monetary
policy
as
rising
oil
prices
drive
inflation
higher
in
this
context
the
ecb
now
faces
a
classic
stagflationary
shock
with
higher
inflation
and
slower
growth
oxford
economics
chief
european
economist
james
nixon
said
in
a
research
note
nevertheless
we
continue
to
believe
the
ecb
will
end
quantitative
easing
this
year
in
order
to
avoid
the
risk
of
second
round
effects
at
a
time
when
there
is
clear
evidence
of
increasing
labour
shortages
he
added
preliminary
may
euro
zone
consumer
price
data
due
on
thursday
will
offer
evidence
of
how
close
inflation
has
come
to
the
ecb
s
percent
target
economists
in
a
reuters
poll
predict
on
average
that
it
rebounded
to
a
high
of
percent
from
percent
in
april
among
other
data
on
the
horizon
next
week
are
payrolls
on
friday
