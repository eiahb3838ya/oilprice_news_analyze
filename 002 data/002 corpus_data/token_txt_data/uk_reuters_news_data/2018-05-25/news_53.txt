asian
shares
were
slightly
weaker
on
friday
amid
fragile
market
sentiment
after
president
donald
trump
called
off
a
key
summit
with
north
korea
though
investor
concerns
were
softened
by
expectations
the
two
countries
may
still
continue
dialogue

the

yield
stood
at

falling
further
from
a
high
of
percent
hit
a
week
ago
the
german
bund
yield
hit
a
low
of
percent
having
fallen
more
than
basis
points
so
far
this
week
despite
the
market
s
shift
to
assets
there
are
no
immediate
signs
of
widespread
investor
panic
with
the
wall
street
s
volatility
index
seen
as
gauge
on
investors
fears
ending
at
a
low
on
thursday
analysts
say
that
is
primarily
because
investors
are
becoming
accustomed
to
trump
s
dramatic
negotiation
style
in
which
he
makes
drastic
calls
before
making
compromises
and
are
increasingly
seeing
his
north
korean
counterpart
kim
jong
un
adopt
a
similar
approach
i
suspect
they
couldn
t
agree
on
denuclearisation
but
looking
at
comments
from
the
both
sides
none
of
them
is
ruling
out
holding
a
meeting
in
the
future
so
i
do
not
expect
to
see
an
immediate
escalation
in
military
tension

north
korea

kye
gwan
said
on
friday
pyonyang
is
open
to
resolving
issues
with
the
united
states
in
addition
to
north
korea
the
possibility
of
tariffs
on
foreign
auto
imports
are
stoking
worries
about
trade
war
although
investors
also
see
this
threat
from
washington
as
a
tactic
to
get
better
bilateral
deals
from
major
auto
exporter
nations
in
the
currency
market
traditional
safe
havens
such
as
the
swiss
franc
and
the
yen
were
in
favour
the
dollar
traded
at
yen
down
about
two
percent
from
monday
s
high
of
and
looks
set
to
post
its
first
weekly
loss
in
nine
weeks
the
yen
is
seen
as
a
because
of
japan
s
status
as
the
world
s
largest
net
creditor
nation
against
the
swiss
franc
the
dollar
extended
losses
to
hit
its
lowest
level
since

its

on
wednesday
on
course
to
mark
its
sixth
consecutive
week
of

the
currency
was
dogged
by
worries
about
a
new
coalition
government
in
italy
to
be
formed
by
two
parties
as
well
as
mounting
signs
of
a
slowdown
in
the

bloc
oil
prices
slipped
partly
on
speculation
reduced

from
venezuela
and
iran
could
prompt
organization
of
the

opec
to
wind
down
output
cuts
in
place
since
the
start
of
opec
may
decide
in

to
lift
output
to
make
up
for
reduced
supply
from

was
stung
by
the
