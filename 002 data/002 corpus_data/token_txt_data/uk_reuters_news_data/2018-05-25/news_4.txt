may
reuters
a
brazilian
truckers
association
that
says
it
represents
drivers
called
on
friday
for
drivers
who
have
blockaded
roads
for
five
days
nationwide
to
clear
their
rigs
from
roadways
and
allow
transportation
to
begin
returning
to
normal
abcam
said
in
a
written
statement
that
it
still
encouraged
drivers
to
protest
but
to
do
so
peacefully
and
without
blocking
roads
the
blockades
have
crippled
several
key
sectors
of
latin
america
s
biggest
economy
abcam
said
it
was
lamentable
that
president
michel
temer
had
authorized
brazil
s
military
to
use
force
if
needed
to
clear
roadways
but
that
given
the
threat
it
urged
truckers
to
open
highways
