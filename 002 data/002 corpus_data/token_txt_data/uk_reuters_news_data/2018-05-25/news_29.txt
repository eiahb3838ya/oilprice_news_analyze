for
the
decision
to
abandon

a
senior

said
on

and
tehran
would
decide
within

whether
to

the

iran
agreed
to
curbs
on
its
nuclear
programme
since
president
donald
trump
pulled
the
out
last
month
european
states
have
been
trying
to
find
a
way
to
ensure
iran
still
gets
the
economic
benefits
to
persuade
it
to
stay
in
the
deal
but
that
has
proven
difficult
with
european
companies
frightened
away
by
sanctions
nations
that
remain
in
the
agreement
britain
china
france
germany
and
russia
began
meetings
on
friday
for
the
first
time
since
trump
left
the
pact
but
diplomats
see
limited
scope
for
salvaging
it
their
officials
will
try
to
flesh
out
with
iran
s
deputy
foreign
minister
a
strategy
to
save
the
deal
by
keeping
oil
and
investment
flowing
to
be
honest
with
you
we
are
not
confident
a
senior
iranian
official
told
reporters
on
friday
before
the
talks
eu
leaders
have
united
behind
the
accord
with
brussels
working
on
measures
including
banning
companies
from
complying
with
sanctions
and
urging
governments
to
make
money
transfers
to
iran
s
central
bank
to
avoid
fines
we
expect
the
economic
package
to
be
given
to
us
by
the
end
of
may
the
iranian
official
said
i
m
sorry
to
say
that
we
haven
t
seen
the
plan
b
yet
the
plan
b
has
just
started
to
be
figured
he
said
european
measures
would
need
to
ensure
that
oil
exports
did
not
halt
and
that
iran
would
still
have
access
to
the
swift
international
bank
payments
messaging
system
washington
has
not
only
sanctions
but
started
to
make
them
even
tighter
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
on
monday
threatened
iran
with
the
strongest
sanctions
in
history
if
it
did
not
change
its
behaviour
in
the
middle
east
pompeo
was
like
taking
a
cold
shower
said
a
european
diplomat
we
ll
try
to
cling
to
the
deal
but
we
re
under
no
iran
s
supreme
leader
set
out
conditions
on
wednesday
for
iran
to
stay
in
the
deal
unless
europe
guarantees
iran
s
oil
sales
will
not
be
hurt
tehran
would
resume
enrichment
of
nuclear
material
he
also
rejected
any
new
negotiations
over
iran
s
missile
programme
which
was
not
covered
in
the
nuclear
deal
the
official
said
time
was
running
out
and
that
if
iran
was
not
satisfied
by
european
efforts
iran
would
seek
a
ministerial
meeting
before
making
its
decision
iran
has
struggled
to
benefit
from
the
accord
so
far
partly
because
of
remaining
unilateral
sanctions
that
have
deterred
major
western
investors
from
doing
business
with
tehran
some
western
companies
have
already
quit
iran
or
said
they
may
have
to
leave
because
of
the
new
sanctions
trump
denounced
the
accord
completed
under
his
predecessor
barack
obama
because
it
did
not
cover
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
its
role
in
middle
east
conflicts
or
what
happens
after
the
deal
begins
to
expire
in
french
president
emmanuel
macron
wants
to
complement
the
nuclear
deal
with
negotiations
between
all
sides
over
other
issues
an
idea
cautiously
received
by
russian
president
vladimir
putin
during
talks
in
petersburg
on
thursday
our
position
is
very
clear
make
the
jcpoa
iran
deal
a
successful
story
then
come
to
us
and
ask
for
dialogue
or
discussion
or
negotiation
on
other
subjects
the
iranian
official
said
european
nations
share
concerns
but
they
say
that
torpedoing
the
nuclear
deal
makes
them
far
harder
not
easier
to
address
they
have
said
that
as
long
as
tehran
meets
its
commitments
they
would
remain
in
the
deal
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
which
polices
the
pact
said
on
thursday
that
iran
continued
to
comply
with
its
terms
but
could
be
faster
in
allowing
snap
inspections
