market
sentiment
was
a
little
shaky
on
friday
with
asian
shares
on
the
defensive
after
president
donald
trump
scrapped
a
key
summit
with
north
korea
though
investors
fears
were
calmed
by
pyongyang
s
measured
response
to
the
cancellation
north
korean
vice
foreign
minister
kim
kye
gwan
said
pyongyang
still
hoped
for
a
trump
formula
to
resolve
the
standoff
over
its
nuclear
weapons
programme
noting
that
north
korea
was
open
to
resolving
issues
with
the
united
states
msci

up

the

ended

lower
on
thursday
though
it
clawed
back
a
large
part
of
its
earlier
loss
of
percent
even
before
the
reaction
from
pyongyang
there
were
no
immediate
signs
of
widespread
investor
panic
with
wall
street
s
volatility
index
seen
as
a
gauge
of
investors
fears
ending
at
a
low
on
thursday
analysts
said
that
level
of
calm
reflected
investors
becoming
accustomed
to
trump
s
dramatic
negotiation
style
in
which
he
makes
drastic
calls
before
making
compromises
and
are
increasingly
seeing
his
north
korea
s
kim
jong
un
adopt
a
similar
approach
i
suspect
they
couldn
t
agree
on
denuclearisation
but
looking
at
comments
from
the
both
sides
none
of
them
is
ruling
out
holding
a
meeting
in
the
future
so
i
do
not
expect
to
see
an
immediate
escalation
in
military
tension
said
masahiro
ichikawa
senior
strategist
at
sumitomo
mitsui
asset
management
adding
to
political
jitters
was
trump
s
raising
the
spectre
of
high
tariffs
on
imported
cars
reigniting
fears
of
a
trade
war
although
some
investors
see
this
as
a
trump
tactic
to
get
better
deals
from
big
countries
the
treasuries
yield
dipped
to
as
low
as
percent
on
thursday
as
bond
prices
rose
before
it
ticked
back
to
percent
in
asia
on
friday
it
is
still
off
a
high
of
percent
hit
a
week
ago
for
many
asian
markets
rises
in
bond
yields
would
have
been
a
bigger
problem
than
cancellation
of
the
meeting
between
trump
and
kim
said
yukino
yamada
senior
strategist
at
daiwa
securities
worries
that
investors
could
shift
assets
from
emerging
markets
to
bonds
have
been
a
major
headwind
for
emerging

the
yen
slipped
in
asia
after
hitting
a
high
against
the
dollar
on
thursday
in
a
reflex
reaction
to
trump
s
manouevres
the
dollar
traded
at
yen
up
percent
for
the
day
but
it
was
still
off
monday
s
high
of
yen
and
looks
set
to
post
its
first
weekly
loss
in
nine
weeks
the
yen
is
seen
as
a
safe
haven
because
of
japan
s
status
as
the
world
s
largest
net
creditor
nation
the
dollar
extended
its
losses
against
the
swiss
franc
to
hit

the

on
wednesday
on
course
to
mark
its
sixth
consecutive
declining

the

was
dogged
by
worries
of
a
new
coalition
government
in
italy
to
be
formed
by
two
parties
as
well
as
mounting
signs
of
an
economic
slowdown
in
the
euro
zone
among
emerging
market
currencies
the
turkish
lira
tumbled
again
giving
up
a
large
chunk
of
the
gains
it
made
after
the
central
bank
raised
interest

by
points
on
wednesday
the
lira
has
been
hit
by
concerns
about
the
central
bank
s
ability
to
tame
inflation
particularly
after
president
tayyip
erdogan
a
enemy
of

said
he
expected
to
assert

the

with
the
opec
producer
cartel
since
opec
may
decide
in
june
to
lift
output
to
make
up
for
