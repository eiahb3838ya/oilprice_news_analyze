kim
jong
un
could
still
take
place
a
day
after

cancelled
the

it

at
this
point
investors
are
shrugging
off

political
risk
also
reared
its
head

thomsen
said
she
cited
the
example
of
turkey
and
italy
where
a
stock
and
bond
has
not
spilled
much
into
other
emerging

states
however
worry
about
italy
kept
the
euro
under
pressure
against
the

worries
that
