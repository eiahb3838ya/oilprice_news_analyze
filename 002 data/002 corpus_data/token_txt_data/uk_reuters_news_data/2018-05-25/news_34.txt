indian
prime
minister
narendra
modi
s
decision
to
accept
a
fitness
challenge
from
one
of
the
nation
s
top
cricketers
virat
kohli
has
been
seized
on
by
opposition
politicians
who
say
the
leader
should
be
spending
time
on
other
challenges
such
as
reducing
fuel
prices
and
creating
jobs
the
nation
s
sport
minister
and
an
olympic
medallist
for
shooting
rajyavardhan
rathore
said
modi
was
the
inspiration
for
the
campaign
to
get
indians
to
be
fitter
when
it
was
launched
on
tuesday
under
the
slogan
humfittohindiafit
if
we
are
fit
india
is
challenge
accepted
virat
i
will
be
sharing
my
own
fitnesschallenge
video
soon
tweeted
modi
after
the
batsman
had
issued
his
challenge
to
the
prime
minister
modi
who
is
reputed
to
rise
at
dawn
to
do
yoga
before
starting
work
pushed
for
june
to
be
celebrated
as
the
international
day
of
yoga
soon
after
winning
power
in
lending
his
political
weight
to
an
industry
that
has
grown
up
around
the
ancient
physical
and
spiritual
discipline
the
fitness
challenge
is
partly
a
response
to
india
s
increasing
problem
with
obesity
but
with
a
general
election
due
by
next
may
the
opposition
was
quick
to
politicise
the
matter
opposition
congress
party
leader
rahul
gandhi
also
a
fitness
enthusiast
dared
modi
one
of
most
followed
world
leaders
on
twitter
to
take
on
a
fuel
challenge
reduce
fuel
prices
or
the
congress
will
do
a
nationwide
agitation
and
force
you
to
do
so
gandhi
tweeted
prices
of
diesel
and
petrol
in
india
have
surged
to
a
record
high
stoking
opposition
criticism
of
modi
s
administration
for
causing
hardship
to
ordinary
people
the
rise
is
only
partly
because
global
oil
prices
have
risen
in
recent
weeks
taxes
on
the
fuel
have
also
climbed
in
recent
years
tejashwi
yadav
chief
of
regional
party
rahtriya
janata
dal
challenged
modi
to
provide
more
jobs
for
the
nation
s
youth
relief
to
farmers
and
to
promise
safety
for
minorities
meantime
congress
lawmaker
shashi
tharoor
hurled
a
compassion
challenge
to
the
pm
through
twitter
because
modi
has
been
silent
on
the
shooting
this
week
of
people
in
protests
against
pollution
by
a
copper
smelter
in
thoothukudi
in
southern
tamil
nadu
state
modi
isn
t
the
only
one
facing
sniping
because
of
the
challenge
bollywood
actor
hrithik
roshan
who
filmed
in
selfie
mode
his
commute
from
home
to
office
on
a
bicycle
after
accepting
the
challenge
was
slammed
for
violating
traffic
rules
by
some
twitter
users
