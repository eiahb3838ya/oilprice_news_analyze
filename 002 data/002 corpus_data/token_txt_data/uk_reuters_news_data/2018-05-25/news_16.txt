that
a
further
million
yemenis
could
face
starvation

yemen

worst
humanitarian

said
in
a
statement
read
out
to
a
geneva
briefing
on
friday
for
several
weeks
at
the
end
of
last
year
the
saudi
coalition
imposed
a
blockade
on
yemeni
ports
which
it
said
was
to
prevent
houthis
from
importing
weapons
this
had
a
severe
impact
on
yemen
which
traditionally
imports
percent
of
its
food
under
international
pressure
the
coalition
lifted
the
blockade
but
tightened
ship
inspections

said
commercial
food
and
fuel
imports
remained
well
short
of
averages
if
conditions
do
not
improve
a
further
million
people
will
fall
into
this
category
by
the
end
of
the
year
he
said
yemen
is
one
of
world
s
poorest
countries
and
the
united

says
more
than
million
people
need
humanitarian
assistance
out
of
a
population
of
around
million
confidence
among
commercial
shippers
has
eroded
due
to
delays
including
as
a
result
of
inspections
undertaken
by
the
coalition
after
these
vessels
have
been
cleared
by
unvim
lowcock
said
referring
to
a
verification
system
in
a
bid
to
speed
up
the
delivery
of
aid
to
yemen
the
united
nations
said
last
month
it
was
beefing
up
its
own
inspections
of
ships
i
call
on
the
government
of
yemen
with
the
support
of
the
coalition
to
take
active
steps
to
boost
commercial
imports
of
food
fuel
and
humanitarian
supplies
through
all
yemen
s
ports
lowcock
said
houthi
forces
have
also
increased
restrictions
on
the
work
of
aid
agencies
in
the
northern
areas
they
control
and
it
has
become
more
difficult
to
reach
civilians
along
the
western
coast
and
in
the
city
of
taiz
he
said
lowcock
referring
to
violations
by
houthis

northern
areas

are
being
detained

are
being
delayed

are
being
interfered
with
in
ways
which
contradict

coalition
is
carrying
out
air
strikes
in
yemen
in
support
of
restoring
the
government

forces
have
launched
missiles
into
saudi

the
united

voiced
alarm
on

a
turkish
