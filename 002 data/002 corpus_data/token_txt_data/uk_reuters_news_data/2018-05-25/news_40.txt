a
political
row
over
europe
s
energy
security
is
not
hindering
preparatory
work
for
the
subsea
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
from
russia
to
germany
with
dredging
work
starting
off
the
baltic
coast
last
week
the
new
pipeline
an
initiative
of
russia
s
gazprom
and
five
european
companies
will
double
russia
s
export
capacity
of
billion
cubic
metres
to
germany
however
eastern
european
and
baltic
states
fear
it
will
increase
europe
s
reliance
on
russian
gas
and
undermine
ukraine
s
lucrative
gas
transit
route
the
united
states
also
opposes
it
the
status
of
the
project
is
on
track
and
we
have
fulfilled
all
the
conditions
needed
to
start
laying
the
pipeline
in
the
baltic
in
as
planned
said
spokesman
jens
mueller
adding
the
consortium
had
taken
note
of
the
political
discussions
dredgers
started
preparatory
work
for
a
trench
for
the
two
pipeline
strings
in
the
greifswald
bay
off
germany
s
baltic
coast
last
week
gas
is
due
to
start
flowing
at
the
end
of
the
pipeline
s
construction
schedule
has
not
been
affected
by
the
contention
that
it
could
undermine
europe
s
energy
security
nord

s
technical
director
sergey
serdyukov
told
reporters
in
petersburg
on
friday
he
said
construction
of
the
pipeline
was
set
to
start
in
july
as
planned
chancellor
angela
merkel
had
long
argued
the
project
was
purely
commercial
but
last
month
she
acknowledged
there
were
political
considerations
in
talks
with
russian
president
vladimir
putin
she
made
clear
that
ukraine
must
be
able
to
continue
to
earn
revenue
from
gas
transit
nord
stream
argues
that
there
is
room
for
both
as
european
gas
demand
is
likely
to
rise
more
gas
will
be
needed
all
transport
routes
will
be
needed
