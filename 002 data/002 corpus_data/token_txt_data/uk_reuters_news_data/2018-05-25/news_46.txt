said
on

a
tough
balancing
act
between
scaling
down
business
passing
some
rising
costs
to
consumers
and
government
interventions
through
subsidies
or
excise
duty

taking

which
is
by

the

growth

levels
are
at
risk
in
the
philippines
which
scrapped
fuel
subsidies
and
its
own

seem
to
be
already
passing
part
of

pacific
says
its
oil
price
hedging
strategy
helped
but
it
still
had
to
increase
average
fare
prices
by
percent
in
the
first

after
a

increase
for
the

with

the

meralco
says
if
oil
prices
stay
at
the
cost
of
the

it
buys
from
its

may
rise

this
may
be
passed
on
to
consumers
who
already
pay
the
highest
electricity
prices
in
the
region
within
a
few
months
he
said
in
india
domestic
demand
has
been
weaker
than
in
the
philippines
after
the
implementation
of
a
goods

services
tax
and
the
removal
of
large
banknotes
from
circulation
and
some
companies
are
unable

raise

says
he

economists
say
higher

will
eventually
prompt
companies
to
delay

the

to
materialise

of
prime
minister
narendra

cut
excise
duties

as
businesses
were

the

acknowledged
that
for
every
rupee
cut
from
excise
duties
potential
budget
revenue
losses
could
reach
percent
of
gross
domestic

but
argued
that
otherwise
for
every
increase
in
oil
prices
economic
growth
could
slow

such
