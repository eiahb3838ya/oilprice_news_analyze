vienna
reuters
major
powers
and
iran
agreed
on
friday
to
move
quickly
to
offset
the
pullout
from
its
nuclear
deal
and
washington
s
renewed
sanctions
with
tehran
pressuring
europe
to
come
up
with
a
package
of
economic
measures
by
may
the
agreement
between
iran
and
world
powers
lifted
international
sanctions
on
tehran
in
return
iran
agreed
to
restrictions
on
its
nuclear
activities
increasing
the
time
it
would
need
to
produce
an
atom
bomb
if
it
chose
to
do
so
since
president
donald
trump
withdrew
the
united
states
this
month
calling
the
agreement
deeply
flawed
european
states
have
been
scrambling
to
ensure
iran
gets
enough
economic
benefits
to
persuade
it
to
stay
in
the
deal
but
this
has
proven
difficult
with
many
european
firms
alarmed
at
the
spectre
of
financial
penalties
nations
that
remain
in
the
deal
britain
china
france
germany
and
russia
held
a
formal
meeting
on
friday
without
the
united
states
for
the
first
time
since
trump
s
announcement
but
diplomats
saw
limited
scope
for
salvaging
the
agreement
for
the
time
being
we
are
negotiating
to
see
if
they
can
provide
us
with
a
package
which
can
actually
give
iran
the
benefits
of
and
then
the
next
step
is
to
find
guarantees
for
that
package
iran
s
deputy
foreign
minister
abbas
araqchi
told
reporters
after
the
meeting
the
talks
between
senior
officials
aimed
at
fleshing
out
the
package
of
measures
to
keep
oil
and
investments
flowing
those
measures
include
banning
firms
from
complying
with
the
reimposed
sanctions
urging
governments
to
make
transfers
to
iran
s
central
bank
to
avoid
fines
and
creating
alternative
financing
channels
we
expect
the
economic
package
to
be
given
to
us
by
the
end
of
may
a
senior
iranian
official
said
earlier
adding
that
tehran
was
weeks
away
from
deciding
whether
to
quit
the
pact
european
measures
would
need
to
ensure
that
oil
exports
did
not
halt
and
that
iran
would
still
have
access
to
the
swift
international
bank
payments
messaging
system
he
said
a
senior
eu
official
said
the
participants
had
stressed
on
friday
that
the
package
would
not
be
immediate
we
made
it
very
clear
today
that
there
are
things
that
will
take
more
time
the
official
said
foreign
ministers
of
the
remaining
countries
will
meet
in
the
coming
weeks
washington
has
not
only
reimposed
sanctions
but
started
to
make
them
even
tighter
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
threatened
iran
on
monday
with
the
strongest
sanctions
in
history
if
it
did
not
change
its
behaviour
in
the
middle
east
pompeo
was
like
taking
a
cold
shower
said
a
european
diplomat
we
ll
try
to
cling
to
the
deal
but
we
re
under
no
iranian
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
set
out
conditions
on
wednesday
for
iran
to
stay
in
the
deal
unless
europe
guarantees
iran
s
oil
sales
will
not
suffer
tehran
would
resume
enrichment
activities
that
are
currently
prohibited
the
deal
lets
iran
enrich
but
under
tight
restrictions
we
were
very
clear
we
can
t
give
guarantees
but
we
can
create
the
necessary
conditions
for
the
iranians
to
keep
benefiting
from
the
under
the
jcpoa
the
nuclear
deal
and
to
protect
our
interests
and
continue
to
develop
legitimate
business
with
iran
the
eu
official
said
iran
has
so
far
benefited
less
from
the
accord
than
it
had
initially
hoped
partly
because
of
remaining
sanctions
that
have
deterred
major
western
investors
from
doing
business
with
tehran
some
western
companies
have
already
quit
iran
or
said
they
may
have
to
leave
because
of
the
new
sanctions
trump
denounced
the
accord
completed
under
his
predecessor
barack
obama
because
it
did
not
cover
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
or
its
role
in
middle
east
wars
or
address
the
issue
of
what
happens
after
the
deal
begins
to
expire
in
khamenei
rejected
any
new
negotiations
over
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
or
its
regional
activities
european
nations
share
some
concerns
but
say
that
torpedoing
the
nuclear
deal
makes
it
far
harder
to
address
them
they
have
said
that
as
long
as
tehran
meets
its
commitments
they
will
stick
to
the
deal
the
nuclear
watchdog
which
polices
the
pact
says
iran
continues
to
comply
with
its
additional
