update 2-eu ready to accept deal to exempt duties on argentine biodiesel
brussels
reuters
the
european
commission
is
willing
to
accept
a
deal
with
producers
of
argentine
biodiesel
to
settle
a
trade
dispute
over
imports
of
the
product
into
europe
the
commission
which
oversees
trade
policy
in
the
european
union
said
it
had
communicated
to
interested
parties
last
week
that
it
was
willing
to
accept
undertakings
from
producers
that
they
would
sell
at
a
minimum
price
this
would
exclude
these
producers
from
possible
duties
to
be
imposed
by
the
european
commission
while
restoring
the
level
playing
field
for
european
producers
a
commission
spokesperson
said
by
email
on
monday
those
interested
parties
have
until
friday
to
comment
on
the
proposal
with
eu
countries
due
to
be
consulted
on
the
issue
on
the
deadline
for
definite
duties
which
are
typically
in
place
for
five
years
is
a
lawyer
representing
one
of
the
parties
in
the
case
said
the
commission
had
not
made
clear
what
the
minimum
price
would
be
nor
what
potential
volume
would
be
allowed
in
the
scheme
with
a
minimum
price
would
mirror
that
used
to
allow
chinese
solar
panel
producers
to
export
to
the
bloc
after
a
major
dispute
over
alleged
dumping
that
threatened
to
spiral
into
a
trade
war
for
argentine
biodiesel
the
commission
has
proposed
duties
of
between
and
percent
depending
on
the
companies
a
document
seen
by
reuters
in
december
showed
exporters
include
the
argentine
arms
of
bunge
ltd
cargill
inc
and
louis
dreyfus
corp
as
well
as
molinos
rio
de
la
plata
sa
we
would
be
willing
to
settle
for
a
minimum
value
said
luis
zubizarreta
president
of
the
argentine
chamber
of
biofuels
carbio
there
is
a
good
dialogue
with
the
eu
and
it
seems
like
the
way
to
benefit
everyone
zubizarreta
added
an
argentine
industry
source
with
knowledge
of
the
relationships
told
reuters
that
if
successful
the
agreement
would
be
implemented
from
february
and
last
for
several
the
commission
began
investigating
argentine
as
well
as
indonesian
biodiesel
imports
in
following
a
request
by
eu
producers
of
fuels
made
from
vegetable
and
recycled
oil
the
eu
case
was
based
on
export
duties
both
countries
impose
on
the
raw
material
soybeans
for
argentina
and
palm
oil
for
indonesia
the
eu
view
was
that
this
gave
an
unfair
advantage
to
biodiesel
producers
there
allowing
them
to
sell
at
unfairly
low
prices
it
imposed
duties
in
but
then
had
to
remove
most
in
march
after
successful
challenges
at
the
world
trade
organization
and
the
european
court
of
justice
the
commission
opened
its
current
investigation
a
year
ago
