in

a
administration
official
said
on

deputy
energy
secretary
dan
brouillette
told
reuters
that
the
united
states
is
talking
with
doha
about
supplying
europe
with
lng
as
it
wants
germany
and
other
countries
to
import
qatari
and
gas
rather
than
from
russia
which
now
accounts
for
percent
of
german
gas
imports
the
united
states
has
warned
german
companies
about
possible
sanctions
over
the
nord
stream
pipeline
under
construction
which
will
double
russia
s
export
capacity
to
germany
via
the
baltic
germany
is
europe
s
biggest
energy
consumer
brouillette
speaking
in
doha
said
he
had
discussed
the
issue
with
qatar
s
minister
of
state
for
energy
affairs
saad
who
is
also
chief
executive
of
qatar
petroleum
qp
we
are
talking
to
minister
kaabi
here
about
other
markets
specifically
europe
to
the
extent
that
we
can
talk
to
the
qataris
about
supplying
european
markets
with
natural
gas
he
said
in
an
interview
they
are
very
much
interested
in
that
and
so
are
we
it
s
very
connected
to
deliberations
with
others
we
have
around
nord
stream
he
said
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
would
increase
the
dependency
of
germany
and
europe
on
russian
gas
but
that
germany
had
recently
decided
to
help
fund
lng
import
facilities
that
could
offset
that
dependence
kaabi
told
reuters
last
month
that
qp
is
looking
to
invest
at
least
billion
in
the
united
states
over
the
coming
few
years
and
he
expected
to
make
a
final
decision
on
its
investment
in
the
golden
pass
lng
terminal
in
texas
soon
qp
is
majority
owner
of
the
golden
pass
lng
terminal
with
exxon
mobil
and
conocophillips
holding
smaller
stakes
the
qatari
investments
in
the
golden
pass
and
in
the
export
facilities
are
very
important
to
allow
us
to
get
that
natural
gas
to
europe
brouillette
said
president
donald
trump
in
july
accused
germany
of
being
a
captive
of
russia
due
to
its
energy
reliance
and
urged
it
to
halt
work
on
the
billion
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
germany
rejects
this
charge
and
says
it
is
open
to
diversifying
its
energy
sources
but
that
sales
will
ultimately
be
determined
on
economic
grounds
brouillette
acknowledged
that
lng
would
cost
more
than
piped
gas
but
said
that
lng
supplies
from
qatar
and
other
countries
would
help
diversify
supply
sources
to
europe
it
is
good
for
the
national
security
of
europe
he
said
cheap
gas
comes
at
a
high
price
of
in
september
qatar
said
it
would
invest
billion
euros
billion
to
strengthen
its
ties
with
germany
over
the
next
five
years
including
the
possible
creation
of
a
lng
terminal
brouilette
also
said
that
the
is
talking
with
both
saudi
arabia
and
kuwait
to
encourage
both
gulf
allies
to
resolve
a
lingering
issue
over
resuming
oil
production
at
jointly
operated
oilfields
the
two
opec
countries
halted
output
from
the
jointly
run
oilfields
khafji
and
wafra
in
the
neutral
zone
more
than
three
years
ago
cutting
some
barrels
per
day
or
percent
of
global
oil
supply
we
have
had
some
conversations
with
the
kuwaitis
and
the
saudis
about
this
my
understanding
is
they
made
some
progress
on
the
offshore
fields
he
said
they
were
getting
closer
to
resolving
