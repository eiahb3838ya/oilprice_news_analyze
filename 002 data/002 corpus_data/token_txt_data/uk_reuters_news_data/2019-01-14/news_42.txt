fears
of
a
sharper
slowdown
in

growth

from
china
showed
imports
fell
percent
in

the

very
weak

it

adds
to
the

you
could
argue
that
the
worse
the
numbers

the
more
incentive
it
provides
to
resolve
the
beijing
and
washington
have
been
in
talks
for
months
now
to
try
and
resolve
their
bitter
trade
war
with
no
signs
so
far
of
any
substantial
progress
in
negotiations
it
also
amplifies
the
extent
to
which
they
chinese
policymakers
have
to
provide
stimulus
for
the
domestic
economy
attrill
added
in
the
wake
of
the
trade
dispute
china
s
policymakers
have
already
pledged

infrastructure
projects
and
cuts
in

investor

on
the
government
shutdown
now
in
its
day
and
with
no
resolution
in

further
clouding
the
outlook

faces
a
hugely
uncertain
path
with
a
vote
for
a
deal
for
its
exit
from
the
european
union
due
in
the
parliament
on

all

events
