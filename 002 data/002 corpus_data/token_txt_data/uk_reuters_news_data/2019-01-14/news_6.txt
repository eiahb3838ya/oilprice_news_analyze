analysis-'zero coordination': mexico's war on fuel theft risks economic chaos
mexico
city
reuters
conceived
as
a
bold
plan
to
attack
corruption
a
crackdown
by
mexico
s
new
president
on
rampant
fuel
theft
has
turned
into
a
battle
to
prevent
economic
chaos
after
state
governments
businesses
and
consumers
were
caught
out
by
the
decision
eager
to
purge
a
prominent
stain
on
mexico
s
reputation
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
on
unveiled
a
plan
to
increase
military
protection
of
oil
installations
and
began
cutting
supply
from
pipelines
that
have
been
bled
for
years
by
thieves
so
far
the
result
has
been
more
than
a
week
of
severe
fuel
shortages
shuttered
gas
stations
and
lines
of
motorists
snaking
around
city
blocks
waiting
hours
to
fill
their
tanks
the
leftist
who
took
office
on
will
score
a
major
victory
if
he
can
eradicate
the
parallel
fuel
distribution
network
which
the
government
says
has
been
run
largely
with
the
connivance
of
corrupt
employees
inside
state
oil
firm
pemex
last
year
alone
the
theft
was
worth
billion
according
to
government
figures
but
the
pipeline
shutdowns
which
lopez
obrador
says
were
drawn
up
in
his
early
morning
security
cabinet
meetings
during
december
blindsided
mexicans
when
gas
stations
started
to
run
dry
in
some
of
the
country
s
largest
cities
officials
in
three
affected
states
told
reuters
they
were
not
warned
in
advance
about
the
supply
cuts
there
was
zero
coordination
said
alejandro
guzman
head
of
economic
development
in
the
government
of
jalisco
home
to
the
country
s
city
guadalajara
we
started
to
notice
when
the
gas
stations
began
he
estimated
only
a
quarter
of
gas
stations
in
the
western
half
of
guadalajara
had
fuel
during
the
past
week
still
once
the
shortages
became
apparent
pemex
s
new
management
started
to
work
well
with
the
state
to
try
to
address
the
problem
he
said
the
government
spent
most
of
its
regular
news
conference
on
monday
morning
discussing
the
fuel
plan
pemex
chief
executive
octavio
romero
said
sales
were
recovering
in
affected
areas
we
ll
be
back
to
normal
soon
lopez
obrador
said
government
officials
said
three
senior
pemex
executives
in
charge
of
pipelines
were
under
investigation
over
the
fuel
thefts
and
that
more
than
a
dozen
people
had
had
their
bank
accounts
blocked
none
of
the
suspects
were
named
the
haphazard
of
the
plan
in
which
millions
of
liters
of
fuel
are
delivered
each
day
by
tanker
truck
instead
of
by
pipeline
is
a
new
test
of
investor
confidence
in
lopez
obrador
who
rocked
markets
by
cancelling
a
billion
airport
five
weeks
before
taking
office
a
successful
crackdown
on
theft
would
be
welcome
news
for
pemex
which
as
the
most
indebted
oil
firm
in
latin
america
faces
the
threat
of
a
credit
rating
downgrade
for
now
however
pemex
is
absorbing
the
higher
cost
of
moving
fuel
by
road
if
distribution
problems
persist
industry
groups
say
manufacturing
facilities
like
auto
plants
could
soon
idle
the
central
bank
has
warned
that
fuel
bottlenecks
could
stoke
inflation
and
crimp
growth
in
an
already
slowing
economy
already
a
new
black
market
is
emerging
for
gasoline
resold
at
a
premium
by
people
willing
to
spend
the
time
standing
in
line
usually
bustling
food
markets
in
mexico
city
have
quietened
down
as
shoppers
and
suppliers
stay
home
to
conserve
fuel
facing
reporters
every
weekday
at
lopez
obrador
has
taken
ownership
of
the
theft
crackdown
but
his
officials
have
not
always
agreed
on
how
quickly
the
crunch
will
be
resolved
calling
it
the
first
real
domestic
crisis
of
the
new
administration
andres
rozental
a
former
deputy
foreign
minister
said
the
fuel
controversy
had
added
to
previous
question
marks
about
lopez
obrador
s
style
of
governing
there
s
not
enough
communication
and
not
enough
coherence
in
the
strategy
said
rozental
a
longtime
diplomat
turned
business
consultant
given
the
complexity
and
cost
of
protecting
thousands
of
miles
of
pipeline
some
analysts
believe
lopez
obrador
will
have
to
back
down
before
the
theft
is
fully
under
control
he
says
he
will
only
reopen
the
pipelines
when
they
are
secured
polls
suggest
lopez
obrador
s
base
still
has
his
back
a
survey
of
voters
by
polling
firm
consulta
mitofsky
said
percent
backed
his
plan
while
some
percent
wanted
fuel
supply
returned
to
normal
immediately
lopez
obrador
won
office
with
just
over
percent
of
the
vote
some
of
the
worst
shortages
have
been
in
states
in
one
the
carmaking
hub
of
guanajuato
governor
diego
sinhue
told
local
radio
all
but
of
nearly
gas
stations
in
leon
the
biggest
city
were
closed
at
one
point
once
a
largely
peaceful
region
annual
murders
in
guanajuato
leapt
more
than
between
and
last
year
to
over
spurred
by
turf
wars
between
gangs
battling
over
the
pipelines
that
crisscross
the
central
state
so
the
government
s
decision
to
go
after
the
fuel
thieves
was
welcome
said
jose
arturo
sanchez
head
of
the
leon
chapter
of
mexico
s
cce
business
lobby
but
the
planning
that
left
drivers
stranded
he
said
was
totally
they
didn
t
consider
the
consequences
he
said
in
the
years
i
ve
lived
in
leon
there
s
been
nothing
like
as
with
jalisco
sinhue
said
guanajuato
was
not
warned
by
the
federal
government
the
pipelines
would
be
closed
nor
was
the

queretaro

of
the
