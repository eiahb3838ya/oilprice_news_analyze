world
stock

a
hit
on
monday
after
a
shock
contraction
in
chinese
trade
pointed
to
deepening
cracks
in
the
world
s
economy
and
sparked
fresh
fears
of
a
sharper
slowdown
in
global
growth
latest
data
from
china
showed
imports
fell
percent
in
december
when
analysts
had
predicted
a
percent
rise
while
exports
dropped
percent
confounding
expectations
for
a
percent
gain
the
data
reinforced
fears
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
were
starting
to
hit
china
s
cooling
economy
while
softening
demand
has
been
felt
around
the
world
with
sales
of
goods
ranging
from
iphones
to
automobiles
slowing
prompting
profit
warnings
from
the

fell
around

suffering
some
of
the
biggest
declines
we
believe
trade

next

will
slow
significantly
on
huge
uncertainty
and
high
base
citi
analysts
wrote
in
a
note
predicting
china
s
exports
and
imports
to
fall
percent
and
percent
respectively
this
year
significant
uncertainty
remains
as
to
whether
there
could
be
a
deal
after
march
they
added
the
falls
in
europe
followed
hefty
declines
in
asia
where
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
lost
around
percent
from
friday
s
month
high
its
biggest
percentage
drop
since
chinese
and
hong
kong
shares
suffered
the
worst
hits
futures
showed
no
on
the
horizon
with
nasdaq
futures
pointing
to
a
percent
fall
for
tech
stocks
while
industrials
looked
to
open
percent
softer
the
prospect
of
slowing
global
growth
also
roiled
commodity
markets
with
oil
prices
slipping
percent
and
industrial
metals
copper
and
aluminium
losing
ground
in

london
and
shanghai
meanwhile

their
lowest
level
in

while

the
world
s
two
largest
economies
have
been
in
talks
for
months
now
to
try
and
resolve
their
bitter
trade
war
with
no
signs
so
far
of
any
substantial
progress
in
negotiations
some
analysts
expect
china
s
latest
data
to
provide
impetus
to
beijing
to
resolve
the
trade
dispute
with
washington
though
citi
analysts
said
even
with
the
rising
probability
for
both
sides
to
reach
an
agreement
the
tariff
and
trade
disruption
appears
to
have
already
rippled
through
the
global
economy
the
regional
trade
growth
appears
to
have
slowed
substantially
after
effect
diminished
they
said
in
the
wake
of
the
trade
dispute
china
s
policymakers
have
already
pledged
to
step
up
support
this
year
following
a
raft
of
measures
in
including
fast
tracking
infrastructure
projects
and
cuts
in
banks
reserve
requirements
and
taxes
in
currency
markets
the
yuan
held
broadly
onto
recent
gains
in
both
onshore
and
offshore
trading
the
chinese
currency
had
recorded
its
best
week
in
more
than
a
decade
last
week
however
this
could
change
said
tim
graf
head
of
macro
strategy
emea
at
state
street
the
weakness
in
the
chinese
data
is
calling
into
question
the
recent
strength
of
the
renminbi
said
graf
the
downside
for
yuan
is
limited
and
that
has
implications
for
the
euro
and
the
aussie

as
measured
against
a
basket
of
currencies
nudged

lower
to

however
the
australian
dollar
and
new
zealand
dollar
both
gauges
of
global
risk
appetite
softened
more
than
percent
in
early
trading
the
euro
was
subdued
as
it
hit
key
technical
levels
after
data
from
italy
on
friday
showed
the
euro
zone

economy
was
at

of

the

and
her
chances
of

look
slim

ahead
