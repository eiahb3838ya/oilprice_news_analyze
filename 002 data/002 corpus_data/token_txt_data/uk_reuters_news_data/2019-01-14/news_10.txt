investor
criticism
over
inadequate
management
of
capital
had
largely
kept
gold
companies
focused
on
costs
while
dampening
enthusiasm
for
acquisitions
but
the
need
to
bolster
shrinking
reserves
and
production
and
a
rising
gold
price
are
now
serving
as
catalysts
for
increased
dealmaking

prices
are
up
percent
since
an
august
trough
when
they
had
declined
percent

january
peak

barrick
gold

annual
production
and
will
have
mines

this

is
positive
for

because

leading
gold
producer

accretive
on
