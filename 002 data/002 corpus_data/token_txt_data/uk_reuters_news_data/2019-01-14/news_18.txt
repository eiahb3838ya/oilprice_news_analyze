more
power
plants
were
shut
in
president
donald
trump
s
first
two
years
than
were
retired
in
the
whole
of
barack
obama
s
first
term
despite
the
republican
s
efforts
to
prop
up
the
industry
to
keep
a
campaign
promise
to
states
in
total
more
than
megawatts
mw
of
generation
were
shut
in
versus
mw
in
according
to
data
from
reuters
and
the
energy
information
administration
eia
trump
has
tried
to
roll
back
rules
on
climate
change
and
the
environment
adopted
during
the
obama
administration
to
fulfill
pledges
to
voters
in
states
like
west
virginia
and
wyoming
but
the
second
highest
year
for
coal
shutdowns
was
in
trump
s
second
year
at
around
megawatts
following
a
peak
at
about
megawatts
in
under
obama
one
megawatt
can
power
about
homes
the
number
of
coal
plants
has
continued
to
decline
every
year
since
coal
capacity
peaked
at
just
over
mw
in
and
is
expected
to
keep
falling
as
consumers
demand
power
from
cleaner
and
less
expensive
sources
of
energy
cheap
natural
gas
and
the
rising
use
of
renewable
power
like
solar
and
wind
have
kept
electric
prices
relatively
low
for
years
making
it
uneconomic
for
generators
to
keep
investing
in
older
coal
and
nuclear
plants
generators
said
they
plan
to
shut
around
mw
of
power
and
mw
of
nuclear
in
while
adding
mw
of
wind
mw
of
solar
and
mw
of
gas
according
to
reuters
and
eia
data
the
predictions
come
from
estimates
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
and
energy
information
administration
data
for
a
graphic
on
coal
shutdowns
see
since
taking
office
in
january
the
trump
administration
has
announced
its
intention
to
leave
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
and
is
relaxing
rules
on
emissions
from
power
plants
as
it
seeks
to
boost
domestic
production
of
oil
gas
and
coal
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
the
main
greenhouse
gas
spiked
in
after
falling
for
the
previous
three
years
as
cold
weather
spurred
gas
demand
for
heating
and
the
booming
economy
pushed
planes
and
trucks
to
guzzle
fuel
according
to
a
study
by
rhodium
group
an
independent
research
group
after
falling
to
million
tonnes
in
the
lowest
since
the
eia
projected
carbon
emissions
will
rise
to
million
tonnes
in
there
will
be
a
limit
to
what
increasingly
cheap
renewable
power
and
continuously
cheap
natural
gas
can
deliver
with
respect
to
emissions
reductions
said
john
larsen
a
director
at
rhodium
group
who
leads
the
firm
s
power
sector
research
noting
the
rising
use
of
gas
to
produce
power
as
coal
plants
shut
natural
gas
emits
about
half
the
carbon
as
coal
the
trump
administration
has
also
tried
to
slow
the
retirement
of
coal
and
nuclear
plants
through
a
directive
in
from
energy
secretary
rick
perry
to
subsidize
the
aging
units
because
they
make
the
electric
grid
more
resilient
that
plan
was
bashed
by
advocates
for
gas
renewable
power
and
consumers
and
unanimously
rejected
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
ferc
led
by
former
chairman
kevin
mcintyre
the
plan
could
resurface
now
that
trump
has
a
chance
to
replace
mcintyre
who
