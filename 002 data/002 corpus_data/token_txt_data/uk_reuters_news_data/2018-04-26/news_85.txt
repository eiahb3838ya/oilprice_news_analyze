update 1-engie ceo says no plans for german-style split of businesses
paris
reuters
engie
ceo
isabelle
kocher
said
the
french
utility
has
no
plans
for
a
split
of
its
activities
and
had
considered
buying
independent
power
retailer
direct
energie
but
decided
against
it
german
utilities
and
rwe
last
month
carved
up
rwe
unit
innogy
between
them
to
create
two
specialised
utilities
with
focussed
on
grids
and
retail
and
rwe
on
renewable
power
generation
that
move
has
given
a
boost
to
the
stocks
of
the
two
german
companies
as
investors
often
prefer
simpler
business
models
kocher
said
the
move
was
a
surprise
for
the
utilities
industry
which
will
be
closely
watching
the
german
experiment
she
said
the
restructuring
represented
a
bet
that
a
utility
can
be
a
better
power
producer
without
a
client
portfolio
and
a
better
grid
operator
without
having
privileged
access
to
power
generation
assets
we
have
not
made
that
bet
quite
the
opposite
in
fact
we
are
a
group
which
presents
itself
to
its
clients
as
an
architect
that
can
do
everything
she
said
no
plans
to
engine
units
asked
about
a
possible
of
some
engie
activities
in
order
to
boost
the
value
of
the
engie
group
s
shares
kocher
said
this
was
not
something
the
market
was
asking
for
we
do
not
feel
market
pressure
for
an
operation
of
that
kind
she
told
reporters
she
said
the
pressure
to
sell
off
divisions
is
felt
more
by
companies
which
are
undervalued
by
the
stock
market
which
was
not
the
case
for
engie
we
are
one
of
the
best
valued
companies
in
the
industry
she
said
there
was
a
time
that
we
suffered
a
discount
but
that
is
no
longer
the
case
she
said
thomson
reuters
data
show
that
engie
has
one
of
the
lowest
ratios
in
the
stoxx
european
utilities
index
with
its
market
capitalisation
at
about
percent
of
its
asset
value
following
the
german
restructuring
rwe
trades
at
about
two
times
book
and
at
more
than
four
times
book
kocher
also
said
engie
had
looked
into
buying
independent
direct
energie
but
had
decided
against
it
we
knew
they
were
going
to
sell
at
some
point
but
we
did
not
need
to
buy
an
entry
ticket
into
the
french
power
market
we
are
already
there
she
said
french
oil
major
total
bought
direct
energie
last
week
in
a
deal
that
will
make
it
a
major
challenger
to
market
leader
