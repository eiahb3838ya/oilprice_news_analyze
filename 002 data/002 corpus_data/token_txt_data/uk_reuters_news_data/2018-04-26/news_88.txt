the

snapped
a

thanks
to

while
the

but
the
momentum
fizzed
in

where

the
music
is
still
playing
and
we
are
still
dancing
but
we
are
reducing
risk
said
pau
chief
investment
officer
at
london
capital
the
worry
is
about
an
overheating
leading
to
a

in

higher

the

extended
their

surge
having
risen
around

points
since
the
yield
is
a
whisker
off
the
percent
mark
that
would
be
a
new
high
the
yield
has
risen
for
six
straight
days
the
longest
upward
run
since
september
according
to
reuters
data
that
alongside
the
rise
in
commodity
prices
has
led
companies
such
as
alphabet
to
warn
of
surging
costs
while
heavy
equipment
maker
caterpillar
said
its
buoyant

could
be
the
high

mark
while

investors
fear
such
warnings
from
other
companies
we
have
been
on
a
real
high
with
corporate
profitability
so
people
got
psyched
up
about
those
numbers
getting
even
better
said
peter
lowman
cio
of

manager
investment
quorum
but
with
treasury
yields
rising
people
are
worrying
we
may
be
peaking
on
profits
or
if
gdp
growth
is
peaking
and
we
are
now
in
a
situation
where
markets
are
getting
very
nervous
he
said
noting
the
federal
reserve
appeared
to
be
in
no
mood
to
brake
its
programme
the
european
central
bank
is
expected
to
keep
policy
unchanged
at
its
meeting
ending
on
thursday
and
will
likely
play
down

recent
softness

the
ecb
to
deliver
a

agricole
strategist
orlando
green
said
markets
expected
ecb
president
mario
draghi
to
focus
on
the
softer
recent
data
and
address
concerns
about
euro
strength
and
global
trade
tensions
the
risk
is
that
he
is
less
dovish
than
expected
green
added
that
could
provide
a
lift
to
the
euro
which
has
sold
off
in
recent
days
against
the
dollar
to
approach
its
march
level
of
weakest
since
it
fetched
before
the
ecb
meeting
sweden
s
central
bank
meanwhile
remained
dovish
at
a
policy
meeting
pushing
the
crown
to
the
lowest
versus
the
euro
since
in
contrast
the
dollar
has
powered
higher
in
recent
weeks
to
hit
month
highs
against
a
basket
of
peers
supported
by
rising
debt
yields
against
the
yen
it
traded
this
week
at
its
strongest
