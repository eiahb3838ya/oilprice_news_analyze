berlin
reuters
germany
expects
tariffs
on
european
steel
and
aluminium
products
to
kick
in
on
may
a
senior
government
official
said
before
chancellor
angela
merkel
travels
to
washington
to
meet
president
donald
trump
on
friday
trade
will
be
a
major
topic
for
discussion
at
the
meeting
before
an
exemption
from
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
imports
granted
to
the
european
union
expires
on
may
from
today
s
point
of
view
one
has
to
expect
that
the
tariffs
will
come
on
may
the
official
said
stressing
germany
would
continue
to
negotiate
to
try
to
get
a
broad
package
including
other
industries
the
tariffs
would
hit
germany
s
powerful
auto
sector
especially
hard
i
think
the
chancellor
would
prefer
a
broad
dialogue
with
the
americans
the
government
is
open
to
extending
the
package
to
other
duties
and
trade
barriers
said
the
official
whether
we
succeed
on
that
we
don
t
know
for
that
to
happen
we
would
first
need
the
exemption
to
be
delayed
for
the
long
term
he
said
germany
s
bdi
industry
association
is
banking
on
an
agreement
with
trump
the
threatened
tariffs
are
an
acid
test
for
the
transatlantic
relationship
said
bdi
president
dieter
kempf
adding
one
in
four
jobs
in
europe
s
biggest
economy
depends
on
exports
the
official
argued
that
as
well
as
exporting
vehicles
german
firms
operate
plants
in
the
united
states
which
provide
jobs
and
export
cars
around
the
world
merkel
s
working
trip
follows
a
state
visit
to
washington
by
french
president
emmanuel
macron
cautious
merkel
has
failed
to
establish
as
strong
a
rapport
with
trump
as
she
did
with
barack
obama
and
the
mood
music
of
her
visit
is
likely
to
contrast
sharply
with
that
of
macron
s
bromance
with
the
president
macron
called
on
the
united
states
not
to
abandon
a
multinational
iran
nuclear
deal
as
western
envoys
said
britain
france
and
germany
were
nearing
a
package
that
seeks
to
persuade
trump
to
save
the
pact
trump
has
threatened
to
wreck
the
accord
under
which
iran
agreed
to
curb
its
nuclear
activities
in
return
for
the
lifting
of
economic
sanctions
by
reimposing
penalties
next
month
unless
the
three
european
allies
agree
to
fix
its
flaws
the
premise
of
macron
s
proposal
is
that
the
agreement
remains
in
its
existing
form
and
additional
elements
come
on
top
another
german
government
official
said
in
our
view
this
agreement
should
be
he
said
could
include
issues
such
as
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
and
its
role
in
the
region
trump
may
try
to
seize
on
a
planned
russian
gas
pipeline
running
under
the
baltic
sea
to
germany
as
a
bargaining
chip
the
united
states
sees
the
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
which
would
double
the
existing
pipeline
s
annual
capacity
of
billion
cubic
metres
as
a
threat
to
europe
s
energy
security
despite
increased
tensions
between
the
west
and
moscow
in
the
last
few
weeks
merkel
appears
committed
to
the
project
she
has
however
conceded
that
there
are
political
as
well
as
economic
factors
at
stake
and
has
sought
to
reassure
ukraine
which
is
worried
it
will
lose
gas
transit
revenues
the
german
officials
argued
that
germany
which
gets
percent
of
its
gas
from
russia
was
not
making
itself
more
dependent
on
moscow
and
that
it
was
trying
to
get
foreign
investors
to
help
ukraine
by
investing
in
its
pipeline
our
analysis
is
that
does
not
make
us
more
dependent
on
russia

of
the
two
officials
