britain
s
competition
watchdog
said
the
planned
merger
of
sse
s
retail
power
and
gas
business
in
the
uk
with
npower
owned
by
german
rival
innogy
could
lead
to
higher
prices
for
customers
and
warrants
further
scrutiny
the
watchdog
said
the
merger
would
be
referred
for
a
longer
phase
investigation
unless
the
parties
offer
acceptable
undertakings
to
address
the
competition
concerns
we
know
that
competition
in
the
energy
market
does
not
work
as
well
as
it
might
said
rachel
merelie
senior
director
at
the
competition
and
markets
authority
however
competition
between
energy
companies
gives
them
a
reason
to
keep
prices
down
we
have
found
that
the
proposed
merger
between
sse
retail
and
npower
could
reduce
this
competition
and
so
lead
to
higher
prices
for
some
customers
we
therefore
believe
that
this
merger
warrants
further
