smaller
independent
refiners
with
less
complex
facilities
are
surging
in
the
stock
market
of
late
as
investors
expect
strong
earnings
growth
thanks
to
the
recent
fall
in
price
of
their
primary
cost
light
sweet
crude
oil
coming
out
of
west
texas
over
the
last
years
the
nation
s
biggest
refiners
spent
billions
building
units
capable
of
turning
heavy
sour
crude
into
gasoline
diesel
fuel
and
other
products
but
the
shale
revolution
has
boosted
crude
production
to
a
record
million
barrels
per
day
upending
the
global
oil
market
by
adding
millions
of
barrels
of
very
light
crude
to
the
supply
mix
a
majority
of
that
new
production
is
light
sweet
west
texas
crude
recent
trends
have
turbocharged
this
shift
full
pipelines
in
west
texas
where
light
oil
originates
from
have
depressed
prices
for
midland
texas
crude
to
more
than
lows
on
the
other
hand
opec
production
cuts
and
supply
issues
among
big
producers
of
heavy
crude
like
venezuela
and
mexico
have
raised
the
cost
of
heavy
sour
oil
that
gives
an
advantage
to
some
independent
refiners
equipped
for
lighter
crude
which
is
less
complicated
to
process
investors
have
been
buying
up
independents
with
less
complex
refineries
like
delek
us
holdings
inc
and
hollyfrontier
corp
as
they
could
benefit
from
low
permian
prices
for
several
quarters
to
come
to
have
your
major
feedstock
be
in
such
abundant
supply
is
unequivocally
a
positive
for
refining
said
matthew
blair
a
refinery
analyst
with
tudor
pickering
holt
the
benefits
of
that
are
going
to
be
unevenly
spread
through
the
to
be
sure
shares
of
most
refiners
have
been
rallying
as
refining
margins
recently
hit
a
high
and
gasoline
demand
is
near
record
levels
results
are
likely
to
show
strong
profits
across
the
sector
beginning
with
valero
energy
corp
on
thursday
however
over
the
last
three
months
as
permian
crude
has
slumped
delek
shares
have
soared
returning
more
than
percent
with
hollyfrontier
close
behind
at
percent
besting
all
other
independent
refiners
the
two
are
also
ranked
highest
among
refining
companies
in
the

reuters
earnings
revisions
model
which
looks
at
analyst
revisions
for

and
revenue
and
recommendation
changes
light
grades
are
distinguished
based
on
what
is
known
as
api
gravity
a
measurement
of
density
a
majority
of
shale
crude
output
growth
is
at
the
top
of
the
scale
with
api
gravity
above
degrees
more
complex
refineries
are
configured
to
run
on
grades
of
crude
with
an
api
gravity
of
around
degrees
most
refineries
can
not
simply
take
in
only
lighter
crude
because
it
would
affect
operational
efficiency
in
order
to
process
more
shale
from
here
on
refiners
will
need
access
to
more
heavy
crude
too
morgan
stanley
analysts
said
in
a
note
last
week
about
percent
of
delek
s
crude
slate
is
based
on
permian
crude
according
to
a
march
company
presentation
the
company
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
hollyfrontier
is
less
reliant
on
the
permian
it
accounts
for
percent
of
its
crude
slate
said
craig
biery
director
of
investor
relations
however
its
imports
of
heavy
crude
have
exclusively
been
discounted
canadian
oil
in
the
six
months
through
january
according
to
energy
information
administration
data
the
company
has
existing
pipeline
commitments
for
that
oil
so
it
can
take
full
advantage
of
those
discounts
said
barclays
analyst
paul
cheng
valero
marathon
petroleum
corp
and
andeavor
three
of
the
largest
independent
refiners
have
had
more
downward
earnings
revisions
over
the
last
days
than
other
independent
refiners
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
those
refiners
with
multiple
facilities
on
the
gulf
coast
rely
more
on
imports
from
latin
america
for
the
six
months
through
january
valero
imported
million
to
million
barrels
a
month
and
only
to
percent
is
from
canada
according
to
the
eia
with
the
bulk
from
mexico
venezuela
or
other
latin
american
nations
the
spread
between
international
benchmark
brent
crude
and
crude
a
proxy
for
import
costs
has
surged
to
more
than
a
barrel
the
biggest
premium
seen
all
year
valero
has
only
about
percent
of
its
crude
slate
directly
linked
to
crude
and
its
exposure
to
midland
is
even
smaller
cheng
said

says
sweet
crude
makes
up
an

of

of
