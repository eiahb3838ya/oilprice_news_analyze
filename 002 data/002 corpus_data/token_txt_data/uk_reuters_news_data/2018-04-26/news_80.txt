french
utility
engie
and
german
solar
battery
maker
sonnen
have
teamed
up
to
offer
a
package
of
solar
panels
and
home
power
storage
to
french
households
they
said
on
thursday
sonnen
a
venture
said
the
package
called
my
power
would
be
available
immediately
ricour
head
of
engie
s
french
retail
unit
said
in
paris
the
utility
estimated
there
were
about
three
million
power
customers
in
france
with
detached
houses
that
are
suitable
for
the
solar
and
storage
package
in
the
south
of
france
users
could
cover
nearly
percent
of
their
power
needs
between
may
and
september
with
the
package
he
said
while
in
the
north
customers
would
be
able
to
generate
about
two
thirds
of
their
electricity
needs
sonnen
s
chief
executive
christoph
ostermann
told
reuters
in
germany
that
the
company
hoped
to
replicate
inroads
in
the
german
and
italian
markets
helped
by
france
s
goal
to
reduce
its
reliance
on
nuclear
energy
and
the
dominant
position
of
former
monopoly
edf
engie
has
tested
the
systems
and
is
now
going
into
this
market
ostermann
said
together
we
would
like
to
become
a
dominant
player
in
french
home
solar
batteries
within
two
to
three
ostermann
said
sonnen
could
appeal
to
customers
wanting
to
become
more
autonomous
in
a
power
market
still
more
than
supplied
by
edf
nuclear
production
used
to
guarantee
french
consumers
cheap
power
but
retail
prices
have
increased
by
around
percent
over
the
past
five
years
as
reactors
age
power
needs
grow
and
the
of
renewable
energy
takes
time
worldwide
sonnen
has
sold
batteries
for
storing
solar
power
to
small
generators
with
a
combined
megawatts
of
capacity
mostly
to
rooftop
solar
panel
owners
in
germany
italy
the
united
states
and
australia
the
french
storage
market
is
in
its
infancy
whereas
in
sonnen
s
home
market
there
are
vast
opportunities
to
sell
batteries
for
million
solar
rooftop
systems
sonnen
said
but
france
has
an
edge
in
legislation
to
support
the
of
smart
meters
that
will
enable
data
apps
to
share
energy
flows
and
to
market
related
services
and
with
an
investment
subsidy
for
the
purchase
of
photovoltaic
systems
germany
is
deliberately
lagging
behind
in
the
adoption
of
smart
meters
due
to
doubts
over
and
data
privacy
considerations
