venezuela debt rally may falter despite oil price, election
new

april
reuters
investors
buying
venezuelan
debt
in
recent
weeks
on
hopes
the
may
elections
might
bring
a
new
government
or
that
rising
oil
prices
will
bolster
the
opec
member
s
creditworthiness
may
be
in
for
a
rude
awakening
analysts
and
portfolio
managers
say
venezuelans
are
crossing
by
the
thousands
every
day
into
neighboring
colombia
and
brazil
as
an
escalating
economic
and
social
crisis
has
left
millions
suffering
from
shortages
of
food
and
medicine
but
those
counting
on
a
regime
change
should
be
mindful
of
the
opposition
s
inability
so
far
to
fully
coalesce
around
the
candidacy
of
former
soldier
and
governor
henri
falcon
who
is
running
against
president
nicolas
maduro
and
the
bets
investors
are
making
based
on
crude
oil
prices
trading
at
the
highest
levels
in
more
than
three
years
are
offset
by
venezuela
s
rapidly
declining
oil
output
since
october
of
the
venezuelan
government
and
oil
company
petroleos
de
venezuela
pdvsa
have
both
missed
making
debt
payments
of
billion
through
early
april
according
millstein
co
which
was
recently
hired
as
a
financial
advisor
by
some
of
venezuela
s
creditors
the
country
s
decision
to
selectively
make
debt
payments
has
pushed
some
bond
prices
up
and
left
others
to
languish
for
pdvsa
s
bond
issue
backed
by
assets
of
refiner
citgo
prices
have
held
up
with
the
bid
around
cents
on
the
dollar
and
a
yield
hovering
near
percent
but
the
benchmark
venezuelan
bond
dropped
to
around
cents
on
the
dollar
in
early
january
before
rallying
to
its
current
bid
price
of
cents
the
very
low
bond
prices
tempted
investors
into
the
market
earlier
this
year
said
ray
zucaro
chief
investment
officer
at
rvx
asset
management
in
miami
what
i
think
has
happened
more
recently
he
said
is
that
the
overall
situation
in
venezuela
has
become
so
bad
so
chaotic
that
the
general
sentiment
is
well
we
ve
got
to
be
near
the
end
or
closer
to
the
end
of
the
current
government
than
we
were
before
zucaro
said
he
bought
pdvsa
debt
earlier
this
month
but
declined
to
give
more
details
venezuelans
will
head
to
the
polls
on
may
and
president
nicolas
maduro
is
running
for
reelection
the
opposition
has
called
for
a
boycott
of
the
vote
and
the
electoral
process
was
rejected
by
the
united
nations
human
rights
council
the
main
hope
for
some
investors
and
venezuelans
alike
is
that
the
alternative
candidate
falcon
a
former
member
of
maduro
s
party
can
emerge
as
a
transition
leader
he
currently
leads
maduro
by
percentage
points
in
voter
intention
according
to
pollster
datanalisis
i
don
t
think
there
s
any
real
chance
maduro
s
side
would
win
a
fair
and
free
election
but
the
probability
that
the
election
will
be
fully
free
and
fair
is
very
low
said
paul
mcnamara
london
based
investment
director
in
global
asset
management
firm
gam
s
emerging
markets
team
optimism
regarding
the
potential
for
a
regime
change
is
misplaced
said
kathryn
rooney
vera
head
of
research
and
emerging
market
strategy
at
bulltick
llc
in
miami
there
s
very
little
reason
to
be
optimistic
she
said
adding
that
the
regime
that
is
in
charge
right
now
is
unlikely
to
make
the
economic
reforms
necessary
to
continue
servicing
the
debt
in
a
reasonable
the
election
notwithstanding
some
analysts
see
the
rise
in
bond
prices
as
a
reflection
of
the
steady
increase
in
the
price
of
crude
oil
in
the
past
year
as
venezuela
sits
atop
the
world
s
largest
proven
oil
reserves
the
biggest
reason
for
the
rise
in
venezuela
debt
prices
is
the
oil
price
said
gam
s
mcnamara
adding
the
higher
the
oil
price
is
the
venezuelan
debt
is
effectively
an
option
on
the
very
price
of
front
month
crude
oil
futures
have
more
than
doubled
from
the
lows
near
per
barrel
hitting
a
more
than
high
near
earlier
this
month
venezuelan
oil
production
however
has
shrunk
to
about
million
barrels
per
day
last
january
from
million
in
january
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
opec
data
shows
the
decline
has
continued
through
this
year
price
is
doing
great
but
venezuela
s
production
is
crappy
so
it
s
not
really
helping
them
out
as
much
said
rvx
s
zucaro
they
re
at
a
point
where
they
re
not
able
to
really
truly
benefit
