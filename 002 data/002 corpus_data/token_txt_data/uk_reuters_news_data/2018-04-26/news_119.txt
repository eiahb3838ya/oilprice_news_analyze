discipline
has
become
the
oil
industry
s
favourite
word
as
it
emerges
from
the
deepest
and
longest
downturn
in
a
generation
senior
executives
are
pledging
to
maintain
a
cautious
approach
to
investment
and
spending
despite
the
recovery
in
oil
prices
over
the
last
two
years
business
leaders
and
shareholders
are
still
scarred
by
the
memory
of
project
spiralling
costs
and
frenzied
drilling
during
the
last
boom
and
the
painful
adjustments
during
the
subsequent
slump
corporate
leaders
are
under
pressure
to
focus
on
returning
more
cash
to
investors
rather
than
indulging
in
expensive
and
risky
plans
to
boost
production
the
case
for
a
more
disciplined
approach
has
been
powerfully
argued
by
my
counterpart
liam
denning
at
bloomberg
this
is
big
oil
s
quarter
to
lose
april
this
time
really
will
be
different
according
to
the
industry
with
earnest
promises
to
learn
from
past
mistakes
but
there
are
good
reasons
to
be
sceptical
the
oil
industry
has
been
characterised
by
deep
and
prolonged
cycles
since
the
first
modern
well
was
drilled
in
deep
cycles
are
the
natural
condition
of
the
oil
industry
and
there
is
no
reason
to
think
the
future
will
be
any
different
cyclical
behaviour
is
the
oil
market
s
most
distinctive
characteristic
and
deeply
rooted
in
the
industry
s
structure
rather
than
mistakes
by
its
leaders
price
cycles
stem
from
the
low
of
supply
and
demand
the
prevalence
of
expectations
and
behaviour
and
the
lumpiness
of
new
discoveries
and
investments
they
also
stem
from
the
prevalence
of
positive
and
negative
feedback
mechanisms
which
alternately
amplify
and
dampen
the
initial
impact
of
price
changes
the
oil
market
is
really
multiple
for
crude
fuels
refining
services
engineering
construction
drilling
skilled
labour
steel
raw
materials
etc
each
market
is
subject
to
its
own
feedback
mechanisms
operating
at
different
speeds
and
timescales
with
constantly
changing
supply
and
demand
balancing
the
oil
market
would
mean
balancing
all
these
simultaneously
in
practice
the
are
never
simultaneously
balanced
or
in
a
state
of
equilibrium
except
accidentally
and
never
for
very
long
economist
paul
frankel
s
essentials
of
petroleum
published
in
remains
the
best
explanation
of
the
oil
industry
s
cycle
frankel
noted
the
basic
features
of
the
oil
industry
made
for
continuous
crises
with
hectic
prosperity
followed
all
too
swiftly
by
complete
collapse
frankel
concluded
the
oil
industry
was
not
and
had
an
inherent
tendency
towards
extreme
crisis
as
a
result
he
was
sympathetic
to
the
need
for
leading
interests
and
planners
to
act
as
eveners
and
stabilizers
frankel
urged
a
form
of
managed
competition
in
which
oil
producers
would
recognise
their
common
interests
and
coordinate
their
policies
at
strategic
level
while
remaining
competitors
at
tactical
level
i
m
not
sure
how
this
distinction
would
work
in
practice
frankel
did
not
explain
it
in
detail
and
seems
to
have
been
unsure
himself
at
different
times
frankel
argued
that
the
role
of
adjusters
and
eveners
had
been
played
by
monopolies
such
as
standard
oil
the
major
international
oil
firms
and
governments
sometimes
in
combination
but
this
was
the
least
convincing
part
of
frankel
s
argument
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
monopoly
or
combination
of
interests
has
ever
managed
to
stabilise
the
market
for
long
even
the
long
period
of
apparent
stability
during
the
and
came
to
a
dramatic
end
with
the
oil
shock
of
which
was
rooted
in
the
long
period
of
low
prices
during
the
previous
two
decades
the
price
cycle
can
not
be
tamed
companies
and
countries
have
to
learn
to
ride
with
the
volatility
we
ve
never
been
good
at
predicting
these
price
cycles
neither
when
they
occur
nor
their
duration
we
don
t
spend
a
lot
of
time

how
the

is

to

we
take
no
particular
view
on
it
other
than
to
recognise
that
whatever
it
is
today
it
will
be
different
sometime
in
the
future
and
after
that
it
will
be

in
my
nearly
years
with

i
didn
t
learn
anything
about
my
ability
to
foresee
that
i
learned
a
lot
about
how
you
deal
with
the
major
companies
and
countries
are
always
cautious
in
the
first
stages
of
a
cyclical
expansion
when
memories
of
the
previous
slump
are
still
fresh
in
the
early
stages
of
the
last
boom
between
and
the
major
companies
were
notoriously
conservative
about
investment
worried
the
rise
in
prices
would
not
prove
sustainable
ironically
the
slow
response
of
investment
and
production
accelerated
the
boom
and
pushed
prices
much
higher
than
they
would
have
risen
otherwise
but
the
combination
of
high
and
seemingly
sustainable
prices
eventually
triggered
a
rush
of
investment
not
just
from
the
majors
but
also
the
independent
shale
producers
the
sluggish
response
of
investment
to
changes
in
oil
prices
is
one
of
the
biggest
causes
of
instability
in
the
oil
market
however
it
is
not
clear
the
major
oil
companies
could
or
should
have
behaved
any
differently
if
they
had
adopted
an
even
more
restrictive
approach
to
investment
prices
would
have
risen
higher
providing
an
even
sharper
incentive
for
other
suppliers
to
fill
the
gap
most
likely
shale
producers
the
history
of
the
oil
industry
is
of
attempts
to
restrict
investment
and
production
to
stabilise
prices
in
every
case
price
stabilisation
efforts
have
been
undone
when
rival
sources
of
supply
were
developed
to
fill
the

every

opec
and
the
oil
majors
may
exercise
some
influence
over
oil
prices
in
the
very
short
term
but
in
the
medium
run
they
have
proved
to
be
not
if
the
oil
majors
were
to
attempt
to
be
more
disciplined
this
time

the
resulting
rise
in
prices
would
simply
accelerate
the
development
of
alternative
sources
of

as
well
as

the
majors
would

with

fate

what
about

here

the

are
at

it

easy
for

to
preach
the

as
the

oilfields

if

they

accept

most
