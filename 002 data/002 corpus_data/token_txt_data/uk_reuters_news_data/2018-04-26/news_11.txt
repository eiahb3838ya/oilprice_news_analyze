british
interior
minister
amber
rudd
said
she
had
no
plans
to
resign
after
giving
contradictory
statements
about
meeting
targets
for
deportations
deepening
a
scandal
over
britain
s
treatment
of
caribbean
immigrants
for
nearly
two
weeks
british
ministers
have
been
struggling
to
explain
why
some
descendants
of
the
windrush
generation
invited
to
britain
to
plug
labour
shortfalls
between
and
had
been
labelled
as
illegal
immigrants
the
windrush
scandal
overshadowed
the
commonwealth
summit
last
week
in
london
and
has
raised
questions
about
theresa
may
s
stint
as
interior
minister
before
she
became
prime
minister
in
the
wake
of
the
brexit
referendum
may
apologised
to
the
black
community
on
thursday
in
a
letter
to
the
voice
britain
s
national
newspaper
we
have
let
you
down
and
i
am
deeply
sorry
she
said
but
apologies
alone
are
not
good
enough
we
must
urgently
right
this
historic
rudd
said
at
a
lunch
with
reporters
in
parliament
that
it
had
been
a
difficult
few
weeks
but
she
was
committed
to
the
home
office
she
told
lawmakers
on
wednesday
that
britain
did
not
have
targets
for
the
removal
of
immigrants
but
on
thursday
was
forced
to
clarify
her
words
after
leaked
documents
showed
some
targets
did
exist
i
have
never
agreed
that
there
should
be
specific
removal
targets
and
i
would
never
support
a
policy
that
puts
targets
ahead
of
people
rudd
told
parliament
in
answer
to
an
urgent
request
for
a
statement
from
the
opposition
labour
party
the
immigration
arm
of
the
home
office
has
been
using
local
targets
for
internal
performance
management
rudd
said
these
were
not
published
targets
against
which
performance
was
assessed
but
if
they
were
used
inappropriately
then
this
will
have
to
opposition
lawmakers
called
for
her
to
resign
isn
t
it
time
that
the
home
secretary
considered
her
honour
and
resign
asked
the
labour
party
s
home
affairs
spokeswoman
diane
abbott
rudd
told
reporters
she
did
not
want
immigration
officers
to
be
set
targets
for
the
number
of
people
who
need
to
be
removed
from
britain
and
distanced
herself
from
government
statements
it
wanted
to
create
a
hostile
environment
for
illegal
immigrants
i
have
not
approved
or
seen
or
cleared
any
targets
for
removals
she
said
looking
ahead
i
will
not
be
doing
rudd
who
is
tipped
by
some
as
a
future
prime
minister
also
denied
a
story
in
the
sun
newspaper
on
wednesday
that
she
is
raising
money
for
a
future
leadership
bid
when
may
resigns
i
am
just
thinking
about
staying
in
the
game
she
said
may
s
spokesman
said
the
prime
minister
had
full
confidence
in
rudd
the
spokesman
added
that
the
idea
of
removal
targets
went
back
a
number
of
decades
under
successive
governments
the
home
secretary
is
working
hard
in
order
to
address
the
concerns
that
have
been
raised
in
relation
to
windrush
and
to
ensure
they
are
addressed
and
put
right
the
spokesman
added
may
has
apologised
for
the
windrush
scandal
and
promised
citizenship
to
all
those
affected
but
the
fiasco
has
raised
awkward
questions
about
how
the
pursuit
of
lower
immigration
after
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
sits
alongside
the
desire
to
be
an
global
economy
some
of
the
windrush
migrants
have
been
made
homeless
lost
their
jobs
been
threatened
with
deportation
and
denied
benefits
according
to
the
guardian
newspaper
the
crisis
has
focussed
attention
on
may
who
as
interior
minister
set
out
to
create
a
really
hostile
environment
for
illegal
immigrants
imposing
tough
new
requirements
in
for
people
to
prove
their
legal
status
she
said
in
her
letter
to
the
voice
the
government
would
do
whatever
it
takes
to
end
the
anxieties
faced
by
those
affected
this
country
is
your
home
and
britain
would
not
be
britain
without
you
