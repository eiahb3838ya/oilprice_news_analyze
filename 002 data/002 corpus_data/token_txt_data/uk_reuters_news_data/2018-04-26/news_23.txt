their

during
a
conference
of
city
and
government
officials
in
germany
we
re
seeing
an
incredible
momentum
for
action
in
cities
she
said
noting
that
decisions
such
as
whether
a
local
park
would
be
built
or
electric
buses
installed
often
felt
more
tangible
to
citizens
than
national
reforms
the
paris
climate
agreement
has
been
ratified
by
nations
with
the
goal
of
keeping
the
rise
in

as
she
readied
for
two
weeks
of
crucial
negotiations
to
finalise
preparations
for
december
s
climate

summit
in

cities
are
indispensable
to
tackling
climate
change
as
they
bring
together
different
strands
of
the
economy
and
social
activities
while
many
national
governments
can
not
deliver
reforms
alone
she
said
never
has
our
work
been
more
needed
or
more
urgent
and
made
this
very
clear
it
was
nothing
less
than
a
climate
disaster
for
many
people
she
said
citing
floods
fires
and
droughts
extreme
weather
robbed
millions
in
developed
and
developing
countries
of
their
lives
homes
and
jobs
in
she
said
the
impacts
of
climate
change
are
not
going
to
get
better
they
are
going
to
get
worse
she
cautioned
citing
cities
such
as
alexandria
in
egypt
and
osaka
in
japan
as
particularly
locations
we
can
avoid
the
worst
of
these
impacts
if
we
act
now
she
said
by
ramping
up
actions
to
build
resilience
by
preparing
for
climate
emergencies
and
investing
in
initiatives
to
address
climate
change
