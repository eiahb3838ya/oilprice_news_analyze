on
optimism
over
a

upbeat

that
managed
to
offset
jitters
over
rising
bond
yields
the
spike
to
a
peak
above
percent
in
the
treasury
yield
this
week
a
benchmark
for
global
borrowing
costs
had
weighed
on
stocks
amid
concerns
rising
corporate
borrowing
costs
could
dampen

nonetheless
the
broader
equity
market
reaction
to
the
latest
jump
in
yields
appeared
to
be
more
measured
compared
to
february
when
a
similar
spike
in
rates
sent
stocks
tumbling
the
equity
markets
slid
sharply
in
january
and
march
in
response
to
the
rise
in
treasury
yields
but
the
federal
reserve
signalled
in
march
that
its
rate
hikes
would
be
gradual
said
masahiro
ichikawa
senior

at
sumitomo

asset
management
in

expectations
towards
rate
hikes
being
gradual
are
enabling

note
yield
rose
to
percent
overnight
its
highest
since
january
the
yield
has
climbed
on
expectations
of
a
steady
economic
expansion
accelerating
inflation
and
concerns
about
increasing
debt
supply
higher
yields
have
dragged
up
their
european
counterparts
with
german
bund
reaching
a
high
of
percent
and
its
british
gilt
equivalent
setting
a
peak
of
percent
this
week
the
dollar
has
drawn
support
from
the
surge
in
yields
with
its
index
against
a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
last
steady
at
and
within
reach
of
its
highest
since
scaled
on

the
greenback
has
risen
without
pause
through
much
of
the
past
week
as
concerns
over
a
trade
dispute
receded
allowing
the
market
to
turn
its
attention
back
to
fundamentals
the
euro
fetched
after
sliding
to
a
low
of
immediate
focus
was
on
the
european
central
bank
s
monetary
policy
decision
at
gmt
the
ecb
is
widely
expected
to
keep
policy
unchanged
but
its
comments
will
be
followed
closely
for
further
guidance
on
the
timing
of
its
of
massive
monetary
stimulus
the
dollar
was
little
changed
at
yen
after
going
as
high
as
its
strongest
since
crude
oil
prices
were
up
amid
the
prospect
of
fresh
sanctions
on
iran
and

about

were

higher
at

and

weighed
on
