reuters
oil
prices
gained
on
thursday
as
the
risk
of
renewed
sanctions
on
iran
plunging
venezuelan
output
and
robust
global
demand
shook
off
the
effects
of
a
strong
dollar
global
benchmark
brent
crude
futures
gained
cents

up
cents
to
a
barrel
oil
has
had
a
very
good
week
so
far
given
what
the
dollar
has
done
said
bill
baruch
president
of
blue
line
futures
in
chicago
the
dollar
against
a
basket
of
currencies
hit
its
highest
since
a
stronger
greenback
makes
it
more
expensive
to
buy
commodities
like
oil
the
dollar
has
held
crude
back
from
gaining
further
ground
i
expect
the
market
to
have
a
good
finish
for
the
week
given
the
uncertainty
around
the
iran
deal
baruch
said
a
top
adviser
to
iran
s
supreme
leader
said
tehran
would
not
accept
any
change
to
the
nuclear
deal
as
western
signatories
prepare
a
new
package
in
the
hope
of
persuading
president
donald
trump
to
stick
with
the
accord
this
comes
a
day
after
french
president
emmanuel
macron
said
he
expected
trump
to
pull
out
of
the
agreement
trump
will
decide
by
may
whether
to
restore
the
sanctions
which
would
probably
result
in
a
reduction
of
iranian
oil
exports
brent
has
gained
about
percent
this
month
thanks
to
expectations
that
the
united
states
could
do
so
the
rally
seems
to
be
intact
and
is
looking
for
the
next
spark
to
push
it
higher
that
spark
could
come
from
reinstituting
sanctions
but
not
only
is
there
the
possibility
of
sanctions
on
iran
but
there
s
also
the
possibility
of
venezuelan
and
russian
sanctions
said
gene
mcgillian
manager
of
market
research
at
tradition
energy
in
stamford
connecticut
venezuelan
oil
output
has
already
tumbled
forty
percent
in
two
years
and
the
european
union
said
earlier
this
month
it
could
impose
further
sanctions
on
venezuela
if
it
believes
democracy
is
being
undermined
