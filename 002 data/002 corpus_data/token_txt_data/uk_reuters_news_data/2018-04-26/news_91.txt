april
reuters
world
markets
entered
speculating
that
the
most
synchronised
global
economic
expansion
in
a
decade
was
about
to
overheat
but
growth
has
since
proved
underwhelming
while
missile
strikes
and
threats
of
a
global
trade
war
have
hogged
the
headlines
it
s
an
unexpected
loss
of
economic
momentum
particularly
in
europe
that
has
frightened
investors
who
played
down
political
risks
for
years
and
stayed
firmly
focused
on
brisk
economic
growth
and
rising
corporate
profits
the
recent
surge
in
oil
prices
adding
inflation
to
the
economic
mix
may
also
weigh
further
on
markets
assessing
whether
a
slowdown
is
afoot
or
if
the
first
quarter
was
merely
a
soft
patch
before
the
boom
resumes
for
the
first
time
in
months
markets
no
longer
have
the
protective
shield
of
growth
momentum
said
luca
paolini
chief
strategist
at
pictet
asset
management
who
so
far
considers
the
soft
economic
data
an
air
pocket
there
is
not
enough
evidence
to
say
this
is
the
beginning
of
the
end
yet
if
you
look
at
fundamentals
there
is
deterioration
relative
to
last
year
no
question
about
big
multilateral
forecasters
remain
broadly
optimistic
the
international
monetary
fund
predicts
robust
percent
growth
for
and
next
year
though
it
too
warned
last
week
of
risks
from
trade
tensions
or
the
waning
impact
of
tax
cuts
data
this
week
showed
euro
zone
business
morale
worsened
further
in
april
while
german
authorities
have
cut
growth
forecasts
after
business
confidence
hit
its
lowest
level
in
more
than
a
year
gross
domestic
product
gdp
data
due
on
friday
is
predicted
by
the
latest
reuters
polls
to
show
a
percent
expansion
down
from
a
forecast
in
march
of
percent
growth
adding
to
investors
concerns
are
warnings
from
companies
such
heavy
equipment
maker
caterpillar
which
said
on
tuesday
its
profits
and
sales
were
probably
a
high
watermark
for
the
year
richard
turnill
global
chief
investment
strategist
at
blackrock
told
clients
equities
would
continue
to
do
well
but
he
predicted
lower
returns
and
higher
volatility
than
in
partly
because
there
was
less
room
for
growth
to
top
so
where
besides
europe
s
faltering
purchasing
managers
indexes
pmis
are
concerns
about
growth
evident
perhaps
most
illustrative
are
government
bonds
in
western
countries
where
yield
curves
the
gap
between
and
interest
rates
have
inexorably
narrowed
all
year
a
fairly
reliable
indicator
of
growth
pessimism
some
of
the
curve
flattening
has
reversed
slightly
after
the
oil
price
jump
increased
inflation
worries
and
lifted
yields
but
the
gap
between
and
yields
remains
almost
basis
points
below
the
highs
hit
this
year
i
don
t
think
the
curve
is
telling
us
anything
different
from
other
indicators
pictet
s
paolini
said
it
s
telling
you
that
over
the
next
one
to
two
years
there
is
reason
to
be
shipping
market
bellwether
the
baltic
dry
freight
index
fell
to
lows
this
month
and
while
it
has
rebounded
in
recent
days
it
is
still
percent
off
its
december
highs
copper
another
growth
barometer
has
come
off
highs
hit
late
in
then
there
are
indexes
that
estimate
how
much
pessimism
or
optimism
is
priced
into
markets
based
on
how
often
data
beat
or
miss
forecasts
and
by
how
much
perhaps
the
most
closely
watched
is
citi
s
economic
surprise
index
which
has
slumped
into
the
red
after
hitting
highs
at
the
end
of
and
finally
equities
after
a
record
winning
streak
world
stocks
are
percent
below
highs
even
more
telling
shares
in
defensive
sectors
such
as
telecoms
and
utilities
have
modestly
outperformed
cyclicals
such
as
technology
stocks
since
morgan
stanley
analysts
said
last
week
defensive
stocks
usually
fare
better
during
downturns
while
cyclicals
thrive
in
booms
the
slight
shift
may
indicate
economic
growth
is
likely
peaking
not
accelerating
at
this
point
in
this
cycle
morgan
stanley
told
clients
what
if
markets
are
reading
it
wrong
most
still
believe
that
while
growth
has
stuttered
rather
than
roared
into
a
powerful
expansion
continues
nonetheless
seasonal
adjustments
after
a
long
and
severe
northern
hemisphere
winter
early
easter
holidays
and
china
s
new
year
may
also
be
to
blame
barclays
for
instance
believes
growth
did
lose
steam
in
the
first
quarter
and
has
downgraded
its
forecasts
but
it
sees
residual
seasonality
also
playing
a
role
even
though
the
government
s
bureau
of
economic
analysis
has
adjusted
its
methodology
to
account
for
seasonal
factors
they
still
cause
weak
reported
growth
in
the
first
quarter
each
year
and
buoyant
activity
later
barclays
said
in
europe
too
analysts
have
blamed
weak
data
on
such
as
the
harsh
winter
easter
vacations
and
high
sick
levels
of
sick
leave
due
to
flu
finally
some
such
as
sebastian
raedler
at
deutsche
bank
don
t
see
indicators
market
levels
and
growth
forecasts
as
out
of
kilter
instead
purchasing
manager
indexes
were
from
late
especially
in
the
euro
zone
he
said
pmis
and
gdp
growth
move
very
closely
in
line
with
each
other
but
suddenly
this
gap
opened
up
between
gdp
running
at
percent
and
pmis
implying
percent
growth
raedler
said
according
to
raedler
growth
remains
firm
but
the
rate
of
change
in
growth
looks
less
certain
if
it
s
the
rate
of
change
then
that
matters
then
that
has
just
started
to
roll
over
and
we
have
seen
the
impact
on
stock
and
bond
