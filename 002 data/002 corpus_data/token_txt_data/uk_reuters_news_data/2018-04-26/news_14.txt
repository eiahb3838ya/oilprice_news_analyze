said
ahead
of
bidding
i
say
to
the
companies
that

the

the
date
was
brought
forward
to
april
then
postponed
to
april
to
give

more
time
the
oil
ministry
had
said
a
combination
of
factors
was
behind
the
failure
by

after
a

caused
oil

to
crash
in
reducing
baghdad

helped
iraq
expand

the

regional

iraq
under
a
model
that
