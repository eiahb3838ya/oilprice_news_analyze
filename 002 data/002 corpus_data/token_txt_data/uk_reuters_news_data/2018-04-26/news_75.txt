berlin
reuters
volkswagen
s
operating
profit
fell
on
thursday
but
optimism
over
its
new
chief
executive
the
carmaker
s
financial
health
and
lower
provisions
for
the
diesel
emissions
scandal
lifted
its
shares
two
weeks
after
elevating
brand
chief
herbert
diess
to
group
ceo
as
part
of
the
biggest
management
in
more
than
a
decade
europe
s
biggest
carmaker
is
shifting
the
focus
to
making
its
operating
business
more
efficient
the
volkswagen
group
is
in
a
robust
economic
position
the
quarterly
results
confirm
that
we
are
on
the
right
path
diess
said
after
vw
posted
group
earnings
before
interest
and
taxes
of
billion
euros
billion
pounds
a
fall
of
percent
this
was
below
the
billion
euro
consensus
forecast
in
a
reuters
poll
of
banks
and
brokerages
vw
said
negative
effects
of
million
euros
from
switching
to
the
ifrs
accounting
standard
contributed
to
the
profit
drop
adding
that
underlying
earnings
slightly
exceeded
last
year
s
billion
if
the
changes
were
excluded
the
group
said
it
set
aside
no
more
significant
funds
between
january
and
march
to
cover
fines
compensation
and
vehicle
refits
related
to
its
emissions
scandal
after
it
raised
provisions
by
another
million
euros
in
the
fourth
quarter
to
a
total
of
billion
euros
the
market
is
hoping
for
diess
to
push
further
profitability
gains
and
is
taking
joy
from
the
fact
that
dieselgate
risks
are
abating
said
nordlb
analyst
frank
schwope
who
has
a
buy
recommendation
on
the
stock
in
reference
to
the
diesel
emissions
test
cheating
scandal
which
has
cost
vw
about
billion
in
fines
and
other
costs
net
cash
flow
a
benchmark
for
financial
health
and
a
buffer
against
future
challenges
increased
to
billion
euros
from
minus
billion
a
year
earlier
vw
said
even
excluding
million
euros
in
cost
outflows
for
the
dieselgate
scandal
we
believe
the
market
needs
to
wake
up
to
the
underlying
cash
strength
of
this
company
evercore
isi
analyst
arndt
ellinghorst
said
the
scandal
has
prompted
major
changes
at
the
german
group
which
is
reorganising
its
multiple
car
brands
and
carving
out
truck
operations
while
shouldering
billions
of
investments
in
and
vehicles
but
investors
have
urged
more
progress
in
cutting
r
d
and
material
costs
as
vw
keeps
grappling
with
high
complexity
in
products
and
parts
although
it
has
pledged
to
scale
back
model
variants
platforms
and
drivetrains
quarterly
profitability
at
vw
s
core
namesake
brand
slid
to
percent
from

a
year
ago
on
advance
costs
for
its
offensive
and
eased
to
percent
from
percent
at
luxury
division
audi
amid
spending
to
launch
over
redesigned
and
new
models
this
year
czech
division
skoda
the
biggest
beneficiary
from
vw
s
modular
production
platforms
kept
its
return
on
sales
at
percent
only
lagging
sports
car
brand
porsche
where
investment
in
assembly
brought
down
the
operating
margin
to
percent
from

vw
shares
were
up
percent
to

at

outperforming
germany
benchmark

despite
the
quarterly
profit
drop
and
risks
expected
from
introducing
wltp
lab
tests
related
to
car
emissions
and

consumption
vw
stuck
to
its
guidance
published
in
february
predicting
a
return
on
sales
