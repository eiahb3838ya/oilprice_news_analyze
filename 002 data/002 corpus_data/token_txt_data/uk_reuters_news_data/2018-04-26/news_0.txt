china
has
ordered
local
governments
to
ease
the
burden
on
renewable
power
generators
by
strengthening
guaranteed
purchase
agreements
and
giving
them
priority
access
to
new
grid
capacity
the
national
energy
administration
nea
said
on
thursday
according
to
china
s
renewable
energy
law
grid
companies
are
obliged
to
take
on
all
electricity
generated
by
renewable
sources
but
many
projects
have
still
been
left
with
inadequate
grid
access
a
problem
known
as
curtailment
the
nea
said
it
would
strictly
implement
rules
guaranteeing
renewable
power
purchases
and
would
order
grid
firms
to
promptly
accept
grid
access
applications
from
renewable
projects
for
regions
that
fail
to
make
the
guaranteed
purchases
the
nea
will
take
action
to
slow
the
pace
of
project
construction
the
nea
also
urged
local
authorities
to
reduce
land
costs
for
renewable
energy
providers
and
abolish
arbitrary
charges
and
unreasonable
project
approval
conditions
local
governments
must
also
pay
back
illegally
collected
fees

an
environment
group
is
suing
grid
companies
in
northwest
china
for
failing
to
maximize
purchases
of
renewable
power
it
said
timely
grid
access
to
renewable
projects
was
crucial
but
the
new
measures
did
not
go
far
enough
to
ensure
china
s
clean
energy
resources
were
fully
utilized
setting
a
minimum
number
of
for
renewable
power
is
not
the
same
as
buying
all
of
it
as
stipulated
in
the
renewable
energy
law
said
friends
of
nature
s
he
miao
we
hope
new
rules
will
emerge
to
implement
the
law
more
china
wasted
billion
kilowatt
hours
kwh
of
wind
power
in
as
a
result
of
poor
grid
connectivity
percent
of
total
wind
generation
wasted
solar
amounted
to
billion
kwh
percent
of
total

the
nea
said
this
week
that
wind
curtailment
fell
to
percent
and
solar
to
percent
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
the
government
is
cutting
subsidies
available
to
renewable
energy
providers
after
a
decline
in
costs
over
the
last
decade
but
it
is
looking
for
other
ways
to
encourage
clean
energy
projects
the
nea
said
in
the
notice
that
it
would
encourage
financial
institutions
to
increase
credit
available
to
renewable
energy
developers
and
would
also
encourage
the
issuing
of
green
bonds
authorities
are
also
now
ironing
out
the
details
of
a
mandatory
renewable
energy
quota
system
that
will
compel
grid
firms
and
big
power
consumers
to
acquire
a
minimum
proportion
of
electricity
from
clean
sources
