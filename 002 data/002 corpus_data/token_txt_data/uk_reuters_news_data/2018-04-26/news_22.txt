finnish
utility
fortum
on
thursday
played
down
concerns
that
moscow
might
block
its
planned
purchase
of
a
stake
in
uniper
after
an
article
in
a
russian
government
newspaper
described
fortum
as
a
real
threat
to
russian
security
the
article
here
in
rossiskaya
gazeta
this
month
by
economist
mikhail
delyagin
sparked
worries
in
finland
that
moscow
might
turn
down
fortum
request
for
approval
to
buy
a
percent
stake
in
germany
uniper
uniper
has
some
power
plants
in
russia
and
the
deal
has
to
pass
a
russian
law
that
effectively
prohibits
foreign
states
or
entities
from
gaining
control
over
strategic
national
assets
fortum
ceo
pekka
lundmark
said
on
thursday
however
he
was
confident
of
winning
approval
for
the
deal
we
are
in
good
discussion
regarding
russian
clearances
and
we
expect
to
receive
them
by
he
told
a
news
conference
we
have
not
received
such
messages
or
information
that
we
would
not
be
getting
these
asked
about
the
article
lundmark
said
the
negative
articles
that
we
have
seen
do
not
reflect
the
views
of
the
russian
government
our
view
of
the
business
environment
is
rather
stable
we
are
calm
in
that
fortum
recently
completed
a
billion
euro
billion
investment
program
in
russia
and
last
year
generated
sales
of
billion
euros
in
the
country
the
risks
of
doing
business
in
russia
are
a
familiar
theme
for
the
company
a
few
years
ago
fortum
was
in
talks
with
russia
s
gazprom
over
a
plan
to
restructure
russian
hydro
and
thermal
power
company
fortum
was
supposed
to
get
a
controlling
stake
in
a
planned
hydropower
company
if
it
took
a
stake
in
a
finnish
nuclear
project
here
which
needed
new
investors
fortum
made
that
investment
but
the
hydropower
talks
made
slow
progress
and
last
month
fortum
said
it
had
abandoned
hopes
for
the
gazprom
deal
several
finnish
companies
have
a
long
history
in
doing
business
in
neighboring
russia
some
including
retailers
kesko
and
stockmann
have
recently
pulled
out
of
the
market
