an
unusually
large
quantity
of

is
floating
off

of
west

as
nigeria
boosts
imports
to
avoid
shortages
before
a

nearly
million

the

availability
is
a
politically
charged
issue
in
nigeria
an
opec
crude
exporter
that
has
to
import
gasoline
and
other

products
as
it
lacks

nigerians
expect
the
government
to
provide
plentiful
cheap
fuel
in
recent
years
nigeria
has
faced
regular
shortages
leading
to
queues
at
fuel
pumps
as
private
firms
have
been
deterred
from
importing
due
to
government
price
caps
on
fuel
sales
and
because
of
the
difficulty
sourcing
dollars
when
a
fall
in
global
crude
prices
hit
nigeria
s
hard
currency
revenues
to
fill
the
gap
nnpc
has
accounted
for
more
than
percent
of
imports
in
the
past

election
due
in

trade
sources
said
the
government
was
keeping
up
the
pace
of

to
ensure

being

a
rise
that
had

amid

were
unlikely
