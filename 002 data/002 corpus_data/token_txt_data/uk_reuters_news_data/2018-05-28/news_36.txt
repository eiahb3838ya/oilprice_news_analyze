announced
late

new
measures

reduce

a
bid
to
end
a
protest
that
has
severely
hampered
the
flow
of
food
fuel
and
key
exports
in
latin
america
s
largest
economy
in
a
televised
speech
temer
said
he
was
signing
three
decrees
with
immediate
effect
to
address
the
main
demands
of
truck
drivers
who
mounted
hundreds
of
blockades
on
roads
across
the
country
to
protest
high
diesel
prices
we
gave
everything
they
have
asked
for
said
temer

the
measures
expected
to
cost
brazilian
taxpayers
some
billion
reais
billion
it
was
not
immediately
clear
if
protesting
truckers
would
demobilize
on
monday
after
seven
days
of
protests
shortages
of
basic
goods
around
the
country
had
become
increasingly
critical
hospitals
reported
a
lack
of
medical
supplies
while
many
farm
animals
are
dying
or
being
culled
because
of
a
lack
of
feed
brazil
is
a
global
leader
in
commodities
exports
and
industry
groups
said
they
expected
delays
in
shipments
from
everything
from
soybeans
to
meats
and
sugar
major
cities
such
as
rio
de
janeiro
have
sharply
reduced
public
transportation
while
many
schools
and
universities
said
they
would
not
open
on
monday
with
gas
stations
low
on
fuel
across
most
of
the
country
police
and
military
forces
have
been
escorting
fuel
convoys
to
supply
ambulances
police
vehicles
and
buses
for
public
transportation
in
most
large
cities
in
brazil
one
of
the
presidential
decrees
signed
by

cuts
diesel
prices
by
centavos

or
about
percent
of
its
retail
price
for
a
period
of
days

third
decree
mandates
the
minimum
fare

to
be
paid
to
truckers

measures
were
announced
after
several
meetings
between
government
officials
and
representatives
for
some
trucker
groups
the
fractured
leadership
of
the
trucking
movement
has
made
it
hard
to
gauge
the
acceptance
of
previous
compromises
reached
by
the
government
and
negotiators
from
the
industry
earlier
on
sunday
sao
paulo

marcio

to
reduce
diesel
prices
for

remove
unattended
vehicles

to
some
ports
such
as

were
still
no
