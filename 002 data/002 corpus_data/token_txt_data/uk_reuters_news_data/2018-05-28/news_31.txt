norwegian
oil
and
gas
exploration
will
continue
to
rebound
amid
higher
crude
prices
a
survey
by
the
national
statistics
agency
ssb
showed
on
monday
although
the
overall
pace
of
investment
by
the
industry
was
slower
than
most
analysts
had
expected
while
exploration
for
new
resources
and
in
field
development
plans
is
expected
to
rise
significantly
this
year
and
next
the
investments
at
fields
that
are
already
in
operation
will
decline
according
to
the
closely
watched
quarterly
report
investment
in
exploration
and
concept
studies
a
key
indicator
of
spending
on
anything
from
drilling
rigs
to
seismic
data
was
forecast
to
rise
to
billion
crowns
in
from
billion
in
overall
investment
plans
were
cut
by
some
percent
since
february
and
are
now
seen
amounting
to
billion
norwegian
crowns
billion
an
increase
of
percent
over
while
initial
forecasts
for
also
point
to
spending
oil
firms
are
expected
to
present
more
plans
ahead
which
will
likely
lift
spending
if
the
schedules
for
these
plans
are
realised
the
accumulated
investment
costs
in
from
these
projects
will
increase
the
investments
in
field
development
even
more
compared
to
the
present
estimate

economists
said
the
decline
in
forecasts
was
a
surprise
but
maintained
forecasts
for
a
central
bank
rate
hike
to
come
later
this
year
it
s
a
bit
weaker
than
expected
said
seb
economist
erica
blomgren
while
adding
that
factors
were
partly
to
blame
and
that
upward
revisions
were
likely
to
follow
nordea
markets
also
said
the
main
numbers
were
on
the
weak
side
of
expectations
our
interpretation
is
that
the
underlying
pace
remains
good
however
we
expect
strong
oil
prices
and
a
further
rise
in
investments
