a
nationwide
protest
by
brazilian
truckers
was
slow
to
unwind
on
monday
even
after
the
demonstrations
against
diesel
price
hikes
got
the
government
to
cave
to
their
demands
causing
stocks
and
the
currency
to
slide
brazilian
truckers
association
abcam
which
says
it
represents
at
least
independent
truck
drivers
called
on

stand
down
but
warned
that
unwinding
protests
would
take
time
we
are
working
to
spread
the
word
of
a
deal
to
all
the
drivers
abcam
said
in
a
written
statement
it
is
worth
remembering
that
even
though
we
are
calling
for
an
end
to
the
blockades
not
all
protesters
agree
with
by
monday
night
most
of
the
country
had
not
returned
to
any
semblance
of
normality
the
truckers
protest
left
south
america
s
biggest
city
and
economic
hub
sao
paulo
and
hundreds
of
communities
across
the
country
without
fuel
emptying
normally
gridlocked
roads
hospitals
said
they
were
running
out
of
supplies
schools
cancelled
classes
businesses
told
employees
to
work
from
home
and
virtually
every
part
of
the
powerhouse
agribusiness
sector
said
the
damage
was
massive
if
not
yet
quantifiable
in
a
televised
sunday
night
address
president
michel
temer
said
he
signed
three
decrees
with
immediate
effect
to
address
the
main
demands
of
truck
drivers
adding
that
we
gave
everything
they
asked
one
of
the
decrees
cuts
the
price
of
diesel
at
the
pump
by
percent
for
days
another
ordered
toll
operators
across
the
country
not
to
charge
for
rear
axles
that
are
not
in
use
and
another
mandates
the
minimum
fare
paid
to
truckers
for
freight
finance
minister
eduardo
guardia
said
on
monday
that
the
measures
temer
announced
will
cost
billion
reais
billion
pounds
of
which
billion
will
come
from
cutting
government
expenses
the
benchmark
bovespa
stock
index
dropped
percent
sliding
into
negative
territory
for
the
first
time
this
year
leading
the
losses
was
a
nearly
percent
plunge
by
petroleo
brasileiro
sa
due
to
investor
concerns
about
political
interference
in
the
oil
company
fuel
pricing
policy
brazil
s
currency
also
lost
about
percent
on
monday
against
the
dollar
on
concerns
about
further
pressure
on
the
government
s
gaping
fiscal
deficit
the
market
is
focused
on
the
fiscal
problem
with
the
impact
the
government
s
actions
will
have
on
public
accounts
said
fernando
bergallo
head
of
currency
at
fb
capital
guardia
acknowledged
that
the
truckers
protests
would
have
a
relevant
impact
on
this
year

gross
domestic
product
in
the
central
bank
s
weekly
survey
released
monday
economists
polled
revised
their
economic
growth
forecasts
to
percent
growth
in
down
from
a
median
forecast
of
percent
the
week
before
in
a
sign
of
the
uncertainty
of
how
or
when
the
protest
may
wind
down
one
of
the
leaders
of
independent
truckers
in
rio
de
janeiro
vicente
reis
said
that
drivers
were
not
happy
with
what
temer
offered
we
are
not
satisfied
with
what
was
offered
nor
even
with
who
was
negotiating
reis
said
our
goal
is
no
longer
just
a
cut
in
diesel
prices
we
won
the
support
of
society
and
now
we
want
a
reduction
in
the
costs
