update 4-colombia heads for divisive runoff with peace deal at stake
bogota
reuters
colombia
headed
for
its
most
divisive
presidential
race
in
decades
after
ivan
duque
won
sunday
s
vote
triggering
a
runoff
with
leftist
gustavo
petro
that
could
upset
a
historic
peace
deal
or
see
a
reversal
in
policies
it
is
the
first
time
in
colombia
s
modern
history
that
an
openly
leftist
candidate
has
reached
the
second
round
of
a
presidential
vote
a
prospect
that
has
unnerved
some
investors
in
latin
america
s
fourth
largest
economy
duque
a
former
official
of
the
interamerican
development
bank
was
the
convincing
winner
of
sunday
s
ballot
with
percent
of
votes
ahead
of
petro
an
outspoken
of
bogota
with
percent
broadly
in
line
with
polls
however
duque
s
pledge
to
overhaul
the
peace
deal
with
the
revolutionary
armed
forces
of
colombia
farc
by
scrapping
immunity
for
those
convicted
of
crimes
has
alarmed
many
colombians
weary
after
five
decades
of
conflict
that
killed
more
than
people
and
left
million
others
displaced
though
outgoing
president
juan
manuel
santos
won
the
nobel
peace
prize
for
forging
the
accord
it
has
deeply
divided
the
nation
of
around
million
people
the
deal
was
narrowly
rejected
in
a
referendum
before
congress
finally
approved
a
modified
version
petro
himself
a
former
member
of
the
now
defunct
rebel
group
has
backed
the
peace
agreement
along
with
the
three
other
losing
candidates
meaning
duque
may
need
to
moderate
his
position
to
attract
wavering
voters
in
the
june
second
round
we
don
t
want
to
shatter
the
agreement
we
want
to
make
it
clear
that
a
colombia
of
peace
is
a
colombia
where
peace
meets
justice
duque
said
in
a
victory
speech
on
sunday
to
cheering
supporters
in
which
he
complimented
finisher
sergio
fajardo
and
said
their
social
agendas
had
much
in
common
fajardo
a
mathematician
who
won
percent
of
the
vote
has
declined
to
endorse
either
candidate
for
the
second
round
saying
his
supporters
would
make
up
their
own
minds
it
would
be
disrespectful
to
say
i
am
the
owner
of
the
votes
fajardo
told
blu
radio
on
monday
adding
that
he
would
meet
with
his
team
to
discuss
options
all
recent
polls
have
predicted
that
duque
would
beat
petro
in
a
second
round
and
that
fajardo
was
the
only
candidate
who
could
have
posed
a
risk
to
the
conservative
frontrunner
if
he
had
made
it
through
however
some
political
analysts
in
colombia
said
that
the
votes
of
the
could
be
enough
for
petro
to
at
least
mount
a
serious
challenge
to
duque
provided
he
can
dodge
his
rival
s
accusations
of
radicalism
petro
was
quite
clearly
behind
duque
in
the
vote
so
that
will
reassure
the
markets
said
camilo
perez
head
of
economic
studies
at
banco
de
bogota
but
the
fact
that
fajardo
was
so
close
to
petro
may
generate
nervousness
as
his
approach
is
probably
closer
to
petro
s
and
that
could
send
votes
petro
s
however
petro
s
more
hardline
rhetoric
could
also
put
off
voters

the
winner
of
the
second
round
will
face
an
intimidating
array
of
challenges
from
stubbornly
low
economic
growth
to
threats
to
colombia
s
prized
investment
grade
credit
rating
as
well
as
difficulties
in
implementing
the
peace
accord
some
areas
abandoned
by
the
farc
have
suffered
an
increase
in
fighting
between
criminal
gangs
and
a
remaining
guerrilla
group
the

polls

the

the

conflict
has
shifted
voters
priorities
to
inequality
and
corruption
from
security
issues
opening
the
door
to
the
left
for
the
first
time
however
a
growing
crisis
in
neighbouring
venezuela
which
has
driven
hundreds
of
thousands
of
desperate
people
across
the
border
is
a
thorn
in
petro
s
side
duque
s
camp
allege
he
would
plunge
colombia
into
a
similar
crisis
while
duque
has
pledged
to
cut
taxes
and
support
private
enterprise
petro
has
promised
to
take
power
away
from
the
political
and
social
elites
he
accuses
of
stymieing
development
at
his
election
night
party
in
the
capital
petro
struck
a
moderate
tone
though
as
both
he
and
duque
seek
to
attract
centrist
voters
when
we
talk
about
defeating
poverty
we
re
not
talking
about
impoverishing
the
rich
but
about
enriching
the
poor
said
the
bespectacled
petro
surrounded
by
family
members
in
a
country
where
oil
and
coal
are
the
top
export
earners
petro
s
pledges
to
end
extractive
industries
have
dismayed
business
leaders
and
centrists
our
country
has
never
lived
such
a
polarized
moment
as
this
and
petro
represents
a
huge
danger
