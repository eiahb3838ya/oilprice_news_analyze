at

about
a
fifth
of
its
south
african

what
we
argue
is
that
all

should
be
treated
the

so
that
all
employees
who
contributed
to
the
success
of
the
company
receive
the

sasol
said
it
was
confident
that
the
share
ownership
plan
incorporates
what
we
consider
to
be
the
most
appropriate
and
best
features
of
