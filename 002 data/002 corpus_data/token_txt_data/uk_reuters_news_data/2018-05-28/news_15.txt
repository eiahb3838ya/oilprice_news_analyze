update 1-germany grills daimler boss over extent of vito van emissions fix
reuters
germany
s
transport
ministry
quizzed
daimler
chief
executive
dieter
zetsche
on
monday
over
how
many
vans
and
cars
need
to
be
fixed
after
a
regulator
said
it
had
found
illegal
software
in
one
of
its
models
the
luxury
carmaker
was
summoned
to
a
meeting
to
answer
questions
about
software
devices
found
in
vans
by
germany
s
kba
motor
vehicle
authority
daimler
was
last
week
ordered
by
kba
to
recall
vito
vans
fitted
with
litre
diesel
engines
because
it
said
they
breached
emissions
rules
daimler
has
said
it
will
appeal
against
kba
s
decision
to
classify
the
software
as
illegal
and
contest
its
findings
in
court
if
necessary
although
it
said
it
was
cooperating
fully
german
transport
minister
andreas
scheuer
said
daimler
had
been
given
until
june
to
come
up
with
a
solution
to
the
vito
delivery
van
s
emissions
issues
following
an
exchange
about
highly
complex
technical
questions
at
a
further
meeting
in
days
concrete
results
will
be
on
the
table
scheuer
added
in
a
statement
asked
how
the
meeting
went
zetsche
told
reuters
it
was
a
good
discussion
we
will
see
each
other
again
in
global
carmakers
are
facing
a
regulatory
since
volkswagen
admitted
to
deliberately
cheating
diesel
emissions
tests
in
regulators
are
now
focussing
on
narrowing
the
gap
between
pollution
levels
on
the
road
when
compared
to
exhaust
emissions
measured
during
testing
germany
s
transport
ministry
said
the
vito
had
been
equipped
with
a
software
device
which
manipulated
the
an
emissions
filtering
system
which
relies
on
injecting
a
liquid
to
help
neutralise
nitrogen
oxide
emissions
in
exhaust
fumes
some
models
including
the
vito
use
diesel
engines
supplied
by
daimler
s
partner
renault
french
prosecutors
opened
a
probe
into
renault
in
january
after
the
country
s
consumer
watchdog
dgccrf
found
engine
software
deactivated
functions
daimler
has
previously
said
mercedes
vehicles
being
scrutinised
by
kba
were
fitted
with
a
renault
supplied
engine
which
had
been
used
in
around
vito
tourer
models
in
germany
under
european
rules
carmakers
rather
than
suppliers
are
responsible
for
the
legality
of
road
certification
of
each
model
they
sell
even
if
engines
and
software
were
supplied
by
third
party
daimler
and
robert
bosch
which
supplies
engine
management
systems
are
both
being
investigated
by
criminal
prosecutors
in
stuttgart
asked
whether
french
prosecutors
were
being
briefed
as
part
of
the
mercedes
probe
the
stuttgart
prosecutor
s
office
said
only
that
it
was
in
touch
with
foreign
authorities
renault
declined
to
comment
daimler
said
on
monday
that
no
diesel
engines
supplied
by
renault
were
used
in
vehicles
sold
in
the
united
states
where
the
discovery
of
illegal
software
devices
carries
far
higher
penalties
than
in
europe
european
rules
on
using
software
to
manage
exhaust
emissions
filtering
systems
are
more
lax
than
in
the
united
states
allowing
carmakers
greater
leeway
to
switch
off
exhaust
filtering
systems
if
engine
damage
can
be
reduced
as
a
result
german
newspaper
bild
am
sonntag
without
citing
sources
said
regulators
are
probing
around
vito
vans
and
models
for
possible
software
that
allowed
them
to
emit
excess
pollution
without
detection
european
carmakers
had
invested
heavily
in
diesel
engines
which
produce
less
carbon
dioxide
but
more
of
other
pollutants
blamed
for
causing
respiratory
disease
than
petrol
engines
however
german
cities
are
now
entitled
to
ban
older
diesel
vehicles
from
streets
to
bring
air
pollution
levels
in
line
with
european
union
rules
