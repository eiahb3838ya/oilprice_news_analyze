paulo
reuters
petrobras
shares
plunged
percent
on
monday
after
brazil
s
government
offered
new
fuel
subsidies
and
softened
the
oil
producer
s
pricing
policy
in
a
bid
to
settle
a
truckers
strike
that
has
wreaked
havoc
on
latin
america
s
largest
economy
as
a
result
of
tax
cuts
and
subsidies
announced
by
president
michel
temer
late
on
sunday
domestic
diesel
prices
would
fall
real
per
litre
or
about
percent
of
the
current
price
at
the
pump
and
remain
frozen
for
days
shareholders
in
petr√≥leo
brasileiro
sa
which
earlier
this
month
soared
after
the
company
reported
its
highest
profits
in
five
years
have
been
hammered
as
the
stock
lost
nearly
a
third
of
its
value
in
the
past
week
compounding
the
sense
of
crisis
petrobras
management
sent
a
letter
to
its
workers
urging
them
not
to
follow
through
on
a
strike
planned
for
later
in
the
week
saying
paralysis
and
pressure
for
adjusting
prices
would
hurt
the
company
or
country
as
a
whole
under
the
deal
announced
by
temer
after
the
initial
period
price
freeze
petrobras
will
start
adjusting
diesel
prices
monthly
a
switch
from
its
current
policy
of
daily
price
changes
petrobras
said
in
a
securities
filing
that
the
government
had
agreed
to
compensate
it
for
any
losses
but
investors
were
sceptical
since
may
when
speculation
began
that
the
government
might
need
to
negotiate
with
truckers
over
diesel
prices
petrobras
has
lost
billion
reais
billion
pounds
in
market
value
its
drop
on
monday
led
a
broader
in
brazil
benchmark
bovespa
index
which
slumped
percent
and
is
now
in
negative
territory
for
the
year
the
latest
pricing
announcement
suggests
increasing
risk
that
the
government
will
interfere
in
petrobras
affairs
again
or
force
them
to
subsidise
the
domestic
market
again
said
morningstar
analyst
allen
good
adding
it
was
a
change
in
the
policy
implemented
in
the
last
couple
of
for
years
petrobras
subsidized
domestic
fuel
prices
boosting
its
debt
load
a
policy
current
chief
executive
pedro
parente
whose
days
some
investors
fear
may
be
numbered
has
tried
to
reverse
there
were
rumours
last
week
parente
might
resign
good
said
the
latest
decisions
might
force
his
petrobras
has
denied
the
rumours
saying
parente
has
no
intention
of
quitting
the
subsidy
and
tax
cut
measures
represented
temer
s
latest
concessions
to
the
truckers
whose
strike
has
won
popular
support
even
as
it
has
severely
hampered
the
flow
of
food
fuel
and
key
exports
in
latin
america
s
largest
economy
a
truckers
association
behind
the
nationwide
protest
has
told
drivers
to
get
back
to
work
but
the
government
said
progress
had
been
slow
and
highway
police
said
highway
blockades
by
protesters
remained
in
place
the
moves
also
left
temer
s
government
scrambling
to
win
congressional
approval
for
several
tax
measures
needed
to
avoid
breaking
budget
rules
a
daunting
endeavour
ahead
of
october
s
congressional
and
presidential
elections
brazilian
farm
groups
meanwhile
warned
that
production
and
exports
of
key
commodities
like
coffee
and
soy
would
fall
if
the
truckers
continue
to
block
roads
some
million
chickens
have
starved
to
death
as
a
result
of
the
strike
meat
group
abpa
said
on
sunday
brazil
is
the
world
s
largest
chicken
exporter
as
many
as
poultry
and
pork
processing
plants
have
stopped
production
for
lack
of
feed
and
storage
space
the
association
said
among
other
sectors
brazilian
steelmakers
like
cia
siderurgica
nacional
and
usiminas
may
lose
up
to
percent
of
their
revenue
in
may
due
to
the
strike
analysts
from
xp
investimentos
said
in
a
research
note
shares
in
food
retailers
carrefour
brasil
and
gpa
sa
also
fell
as
analysts
warned
their
supply
chains
would
suffer
