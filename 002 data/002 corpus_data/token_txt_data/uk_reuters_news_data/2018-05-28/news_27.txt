league
parties
abandoned
plans
to

were
a
mixed

points
on
concern
new
elections
would
turn
into
a
debate
on
euro
membership
we
doubt
this
rally
in

has
legs
as
what
this
means
is
that
the
next
election
in
italy
becomes
a
referendum
vote
on

said
his
refusal
to
accept

minister
paolo
savona

pull
italy
out
of
the

forced
the

the

to
abandon
efforts
to

initially
rallied
percent
to
pulling
itself
above

by
percent
against
the
swiss
franc
rebounding
from
near
lows
to

at
but
also
gave
up
much
of
those
gains
italian
bond
yields
had
dropped
basis
points

earlier
as

then
the
populists
are
likely
to
get
a
stronger
share
and
a
more
extreme
