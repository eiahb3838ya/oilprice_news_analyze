knows
how
much
cash
going
green
can
save
four
years
ago
after
signing
up
for
my
green
home
an
effort
by
the
green
building
council
of
south
africa
to
make
buildings
more
energy
efficient
her
family
saw
their
house
in
the
suburb
of
pinelands
retrofitted
with
energy
saving
led
lights
showerheads
and
solar
panels
as
well
as
winter
insulation
as
part
of
the
green
makeover
the
family
also
learned
to
cut
their
energy
use
by
hanging
laundry
out
to
dry
rather
than
using
a
tumble
dryer
switching
off
appliances
that
aren
t
being
used
and
switching
to
washing
laundry
with
cold
water
my
children
were
very
excited
as
we
got
to
do
this
as
a
family
a
consultant
at
the
university
of
cape
town
s
graduate
school
of
business
told
the
thompson
reuters
foundation
better
yet
since
joining
the
programme
her
family
s
energy
costs
have
fallen
by
nearly
percent
she
said
as
south
african
cities
aim
to
battle
the
effects
of
climate
change
from
drought
in
cape
town
to
the
threat
of
rising
seas
and
flooding
in
durban
four
cities
have
banded
together
to
try
to
create
buildings
which
produce
no
contribution
to
climate
change
in
their
use
of
energy
working
in
conjunction
with
the
cities
initiative
a
group
of
major
world
cities
trying
to
cut
emissions
the
plan
is
to
require
new
buildings
in
johannesburg
cape
town
ethekwini
formerly
durban
and
tshwane
formerly
pretoria
to
become
much
more
energy
efficient
to
cut
electricity
bills
and
greenhouse
gas
emissions
tim
pryce
who
runs
energy
and
buildings
programmes
worldwide
said
the
effort
seeks
to
help
south
african
cities
rapidly
scale
up
building
efforts
and
share
what
they
learn
with
other
cities
buildings
make
up
the
largest
single
source
of
emissions
in
cities
globally
with
over
half
of
the
total
emissions
he
said
if
we
are
to
avoid
hugely
damaging
impacts
from
climate
change
impacts
that
will
make
the
current
water
shortage
in
cape
town
look
minor
we
need
to
drive
these
emissions
down
as
rapidly
as
possible
towards
net
zero
carbon
all
around
the
world
by
at
the
latest
pryce
told
thompson
reuters
foundation
future
cities
that
achieve
net
zero
carbon
would
produce
very
few
emissions
with
those
still
produced
offset
by
means
such
as
planting
trees
ensuring
new
buildings
are
highly
efficient
and
run
largely
on
renewable
energy
is
crucial
to
try
to
limit
global
warming
to
relatively
safe
levels
pryce
said
our
target
is
to
work
with
the
four
cities
to
bring
policies
such
as
better
building
codes
or
more
ambitious
planning
requirements
into
effect
by
the
end
of
he
said
building
experts
from
sustainable
energy
africa
an
organisation
that
promotes
equitable
and
low
carbon
clean
energy
development
will
work
with
teams
in
the
target
south
african
cities
to
make
that
happen
he
said
it
is
indeed
a
good
thing
said
thulani
kuzwayo
a
marketer
with
the
green
building
council
south
africa
gbcsa
which
has
certified
over
green
star
buildings
since
to
achieve
the
certification
buildings
must
be
energy
efficient
comfortable
handle
waste
responsibly
and
contain
spaces
that
contribute
to
the
health
and
of
their
users
the
effort
can
shift
paradigms
in
planning
design
construction
and
building
operation
said
kuzwayo
who
is
also
chair
of
world
green
building
council
s
african
regional
network
because
many
buildings
are
made
to
last
up
to
years
building
them
for
efficiency
can
result
in
a
huge
savings
in
emissions
over
time
kuzwayo
said
however
south
africa
is
still
at
the
early
stages
of
adopting
green
building
standards
he
said
the
problems
encountered
include
the
common
perception
that
green
buildings
are
expensive
they
can
be
but
they
don
t
have
to
be
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
perceived
elitism
associated
with
green
buildings
also
can
be
an
issue
as
people
tend
to
view
them
as
expensive
he
said
he
said
changes
in
how
buildings
are
created
must
be
led
by
governments
for
the
desired
scale
and
impact
if
government
leads
in
constructing
and
operating
buildings
it
will
propel
the
adoption
drastically
kuzwayo
said
sometimes
the
worries
each
city
faces
can
help
drive
action
in
cape
town
the
my
green
home
effort
launched
right
after
the
power
utility
eskom
had
problems
to
provide
adequate
electricity
in
the
country
remembers
whose
household
was
chosen
as
one
of
the
programme
s
pioneers
people
were
challenged
to
come
up
with
alternative
ways
to
save
and
use
power
she
said
now
cape
town
has
a
new
worry
water
supplies
in
the
face
of
longer
droughts
linked
to
climate
change
s
family
is
now
adapting
to
that
as
well
through
things
like
reusing
household
wastewater
as
part
of
the
city
s
home
greening
efforts
though
the
initial
focus
was
strongly
focused
on
energy
saving
we
still
do
it
up
to
now
due
to
water
problems
we
also
now
utilise
our
grey
water
at
home
