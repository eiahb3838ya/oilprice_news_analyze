the
slack
period
for
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
in
top
consumer
asia
is
usually
the
shoulder
season
between
winter
and
summer
or
march
to
may
but
this
pattern
hasn
t
really
repeated
this
year
the
spot
price
of
the
fuel
in
asia
has
been
on
a
rising
trend
since
the
beginning
of
april
and
hit
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
at
the
end
of
last
week
it
touched
its
low
for
of
per
mmbtu
in
the
week
ended
march
remained
unchanged
the
next
week
and
then
posted
gains
in
six
of
the
seven
weeks
since
last
year
the
shoulder
season
low
of
per
mmbtu
was
first
reached
in
late
march
and
the
price
drifted
in
a
narrow
band
until
early
july
when
it
started
climbing
from
in
the
week
to
july
in
the
low
was
hit
in
early
april
before
a
mild
rally
for
the
northern
summer
and
then
another
dip
in
the
autumn
shoulder
season
before
strong
gains
in
the
winter
period
what
appears
to
be
different
so
far
this
year
is
that
while
seasonal
price
fluctuations
are
still
evident
the
dip
was
shallower
than
in
previous
years
and
the
rally
from
the
low
looks
sharper
so
far
spot
lng
fell
percent
from
its
peak
of
per
mmbtu
for
the
winter
of
to
the
low
in
late
march
while
in
the
slump
from
winter
peak
to
shoulder
season
low
was
percent
and
it
was
percent
the
prior
year
so
far
lng
has
rallied
percent
from
the
low
in
the
space
of
eight
weeks
in
eight
weeks
after
reaching
the
low
lng
had
gained
just
percent
while
the
increase
was
percent
in
what
the
numbers
show
is
that
while
seasonality
is
still
in
place
the
price
lows
aren
t
as
deep
as
in
previous
years
and
the
rally
from
that
low
appears
to
be
on
track
to
be
steeper
and
higher
the
easy
explanation
for
this
dynamic
is
china
which
has
continued
to
buy
lng
at
a
frantic
pace
this
year
after
the
percent
jump
in
imports
in
to
a
total
of
million
tonnes
making
it
the
world
s
buyer
behind
japan
china
s
lng
imports
rose
percent
to
million
tonnes
in
the
first
four
months
of
this
year
compared
to
the
same
period
a
year
earlier
according
to
customs
data
this
would
put
it
on
target
for
imports
of
more
than
million
tonnes
for
the
full
year
but
this
is
likely
to
be
a
conservative
estimate
given
lng
buying
tend
to
ramp
up
in
the
months
ahead
of
the
peak
winter
demand
period
but
it
s
not
just
china
that
is
sucking
up
more
lng
with
south
korea
making
a
bid
to
reclaim
its
former
place
as
the
world
s
importer
in
the
first
four
months
of
the
year
south
korea
brought
in
million
tonnes
of
lng
up
percent
from
the
same
period
last
year
according
customs
data
even
top
importer
japan
is
buying
modestly
more
lng
with
imports
in
the
first
quarter
up
percent
from
the
same
period
in
a
faster
pace
of
growth
than
the
percent
for
the
whole
of
it
s
not
only
the
top
three
importers
that
are
showing
growth
with
total
global
seaborne
lng
flows
rising
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
supply
chain
and
commodity
forecasts
in
the
first
five
months
of
a
total
of
million
tonnes
of
lng
has
been
discharged
a
figure
that
may
rise
to
closer
to
million
by
the
end
of
this
month
as
more
vessels
are
unloaded
this
would
be
some
million
tonnes
or
almost
percent
more
than
the
million
tonnes
discharged
in
the
first
five
months
of
last
year
the
data
shows
that
while
china
is
the
standout
when
it
comes
to
driving
lng
demand
and
prices
it
s
not
the
only
show

town
