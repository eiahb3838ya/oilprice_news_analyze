hassan
asked
fellow

at
the

to
stand
there
is

minister
svenja
schulze
said
the
importance
of
the
small
print
can
not
be
and
will
enable
countries
actions
to
be
made
transparent
mohamed
adow
of
christian
aid
said
delivering
a
successful
outcome
in
katowice
is
like
solving
a
jigsaw
it
has
three
parts
the
paris
rulebook
finance
for
poor
countries
and
renewed
emissions
reductions
like
an
african
stool
it
doesn
t
work
if
one
of
the
legs
is
missing
he
added
in
a
central
zone
of
the
sprawling
venue
countries
have
pavilions
where
they
showcase
their
efforts
the
polish
pavilion
has
been
described
as
provocative
by
some
environmentalists
because
one
side
has
cages
of
coal
on
the
wall
with
the
slogan
black
to
green
transformation
implying
coal
can
be
used
in
a
way
that
significantly
reduces
its
carbon
emissions
qatar
is
usually
in
the
lavish
gulf
cooperation
council
pavilion
but
has
its
own
smaller
one
this
year
the
country
is
in
a
diplomatic
rift
with
other
members
and
its
leader
boycotted
a
gcc
summit
on
sunday
last
week
qatar
said
it
would
quit
opec
to
focus
on
gas
in
a
swipe
at
saudi
arabia
the
de
facto
leader
of
the
oil
exporting
group
which
is
trying
to
show
unity
in
tackling
an
oil
price
