australian company targets 'under-explored' gas in portugal
lisbon

reuters
a
search
for
hydrocarbons
in
portugal
s
onshore
lusitanian
basin
could
reveal
enough
natural
gas
to
supply
the
whole
country
for
years
according
to
the
boss
of
australis
oil
gas
which
has
exclusive
rights
to
two
concessions
in
the
area
portugal
is
relatively
but
there
is
a
relatively
high
success
rate
chief
executive
ian
lusted
told
reuters
but
to
date
there
have
been
no
sizeable
findings
and
there
is
no
hydrocarbon
production
at
all
in
the
according
to
the
company
which
won
an
exploration
licence
in
a
total
of
onshore
wells
have
been
drilled
in
the
country
so
far
with
the
majority
being
shallow
wells
of
less
than
metres
however
from
the
wells
already
drilled
in
batalha
and
pombal
in
central
portugal
the
two
concessions
owned
by
the
company
there
are
indications
of
two
working
hydrocarbon
systems
we
had
independent
engineers
who
assessed
that
the
recoverable
volume
was
about
years
of
supply
for
the
whole
of
portugal
lusted
said
portugal
s
natural
gas
consumption
was
estimated
at
billion
cubic
meters
billion
cu
ft
in
this
is
potentially
very
beneficial
for
the
country
and
it
ties
up
with
government
policy
lusted
added
the
government
said
early
in
december
it
was
aiming
for
renewable
energy
sources
to
account
for
percent
of
portugal
s
energy
by
rising
to
percent
in
environmentalists
have
expressed
concerns
about
the
natural
gas
project
even
though
it
is
a
cleaner
energy
source
than
oil
and
could
be
used
in
a
transition
period
as
the
country
turns
to
renewables
the
drilling
in
the
two
areas
could
start
in
early
but
it
still
has
to
be
assessed
by
environmental
authorities
environmentalists
also
fear
the
australian
company
could
use
an
extraction
process
known
as
fracking
which
has
been
criticised
in
some
countries
for
disrupting
local
communities
lusted
denied
this
saying
the
company
would
only
be
allowed
to
drill
a
well
and
produce
it
conventionally
in
a
petition
signed
by
more
than
people
local
organisation
asmaa
wrote
that
the
concessions
where
australis
will
drill
include
areas
of
high
population
density
and
many
areas
of
cultural
and
historical
interest
as
well
as
many
nature
reserves
