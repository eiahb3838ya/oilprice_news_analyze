update 1-cuadrilla pauses gas fracking at english site after more tremors
london
reuters
british
shale
gas
company
cuadrilla
has
again
paused
fracking
at
its
preston
new
road
site
in
lancashire
northwest
england
after
tremors
were
detected
the
company
said
this
marks
the
third
time
operations
have
been
halted
at
the
site
following
seismic
activity
under
britain
s
traffic
light
regulation
system
since
they
began
in
october
a
series
of
micro
seismic
events
in
blackpool
have
been
recorded
on
the
british
geological
survey
website
this
morning
following
hydraulic
fracturing
at
our
shale
gas
exploration
site
in
preston
new
road
lancashire
cuadrilla
said
in
a
statement
the
largest
tremor
of
magnitude
took
place
after
fracking
activities
had
already
stopped
it
said
according
to
recent
research
by
the
university
of
liverpool
the
impact
would
be
like
dropping
a
melon
cuadrilla
said
fracking
or
hydraulically
fracturing
involves
extracting
gas
from
rocks
by
breaking
them
up
with
water
and
chemicals
at
high
pressure
it
is
opposed
by
environmentalists
who
say
extracting
more
fossil
fuel
is
at
odds
with
britain
s
commitment
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
however
the
government
is
keen
to
reduce
the
country
s
reliance
on
imports
of
natural
gas
which
is
used
to
heat
around
percent
of
britain
s
homes
the
company
which
is
percent
owned
by
australia
s
aj
lucas
and
percent
owned
by
a
fund
managed
by
riverstone
first
attempted
to
frack
gas
near
the
coastal
town
of
blackpool
in
northwestern
england
in
but
the
practice
led
to
a
magnitude
earth
tremor
it
said
then
that
the
quakes
at
that
site
were
caused
by
an
unusual
combination
of
geological
features
but
they
led
to
an
nationwide
ban
on
fracking
while
further
research
was
carried
out
the
government
has
since
introduced
a
system
that
immediately
suspends
work
if
seismic
activity
of
magnitude
or
above
is
detected
cuadrilla
will
pause
and
continue
to
monitor
micro
seismicity
for
at
least
the
next
hours
well
integrity
has
been
checked
and
verified
it
said
cuadrilla
said
last
month
it
had
extracted
its
first
shale
gas
from
the
site
gas
flows
were
small
but
coming
at
such
an
early
stage
of
the
project
were
evidence
of
the
site
s
potential
