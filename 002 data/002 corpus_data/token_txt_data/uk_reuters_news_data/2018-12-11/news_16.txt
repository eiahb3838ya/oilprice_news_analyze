deforestation
in
brazil
s
tropical
cerrado
savanna
which
makes
up
a
quarter
of
the
country
fell
percent
to
a
record
low
in
compared
with
a
year
earlier
the
ministry
of
environment
said
in
a
statement
on
tuesday
deforestation
in
the
south
american
country
s
savanna
biome
totaled
square
kilometers
square
miles
an
area
larger
than
the
state
of
connecticut
that
s
just
below
square
kilometers
in
the
previous
low
since
records
began
to
be
kept
the
ministry
said
a
biome
is
a
grouping
of
plants
and
animals
that
have
adapted
to
a
specific
environment
this
contrasts
with
the
amazon
rainforest
making
up
percent
of
brazil
which
has
seen
a
percent
spike
in
deforestation
this
year
to
a
high
activists
have
been
concerned
that
deforestation
could
spike
under
policies
proposed
by
jair
bolsonaro
who
assumes
office
and
has
pledged
to
end
the
current
industry
of
fines
for
environmental
violations
like
deforestation
the
figure
for
cerrado
is
based
on
the
change
in
deforestation
between
august
and
july
the
period
used
to
measure
annual
destruction
as
recorded
by
brazilian
space
research
agency
inpe
the
statement
did
not
give
a
reason
for
the
decline
in
deforestation
the
cerrado
s
vegetation
soaks
up
major
amounts
of
carbon
dioxide
making
its
preservation
key
to
curbing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
for
countering
global
warming
while
the
cerrado
is
less
densely
forested
than
the
amazon
rainforest
its
plants
have
deep
roots
that
lock
carbon
into
the
ground
and
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
an
underground
forest
ricardo
salles
brazil
s
future
environment
minister
under
bolsonaro
told
reuters
on
monday
that
bolsonaro
would
not
gut
resources
for
environmental
protection
contrary
to
the
fears
of
environmentalists
money
for
environmental
protection
is
spent
inefficiently
and
mismanaged
he
said
arguing
he
could
produce
better
results
with
the
same
budget
