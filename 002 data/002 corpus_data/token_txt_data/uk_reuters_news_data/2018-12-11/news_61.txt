change
are
in
their
crucial
final
week
in
katowice
capital
of
poland
s
silesian
coal
mining
district
the
aim
is
to
meet
an
deadline
for
agreeing
a
rule
book
on
how
to
enforce
action
to
limit
further
warming
of
the
planet
below
is
a
flavour
of
the
mood
around
the
event
held
in
a
sprawl
of
temporary
passageways
and
meeting
rooms
next
to
the
spodek
a
sports
and
concert
venue
built
on
the

of

ministers
and
heads
of
state
from
around
countries
have
been
arriving
and
will
start
to
give
opening
speeches

their

working
behind
closed
doors
to
have
a
draft
text
on
the
rules
for
implementing
the
paris
agreement
ready
by
gmt
yesterday
france
s
laurent
fabius
who
presided
over
the
paris
agreement
said
he
would
be
surprised
if
there
was
no
deal
struck
on
a
rulebook
by
the
end
of
the
week
but
the
level
of
ambition
was
an
issue
taking
into
context
recent
scientific
reports
we
have
had
the
numbers
are
bad
and
we
are
not
on
track
so
we
have
to
be
more
ambitious
that
is
where
the
negotiations
will
make
or
break
in
the
final
hours
he
told
reporters
the
pacific
island
nation
of
vanuatu
has
called
for
a
new
loss
and
damage
fund
to
ensure
payments
from
rich
industrialised
nations
go
to
those
most
affected
by
climate
disasters
the
idea
of
taxing
the
fossil
fuel
industry
is
an
economically
sensible
approach
and
a
moral
approach
said
vanuatu
s
foreign
minister
ralph
regenvanu
before
the
talks
vanuatu
announced
it
would
explore
taking
legal
action
against
fossil
fuel
companies
and
countries
for
their
role
in
causing
climate
change
loss
and
damage
compensation
has
always
been
a
sticking
point
at
climate
talks
in
a
central
zone
of
the
sprawling
venue
countries
have
pavilions
where
they
showcase
their
efforts
the
polish
pavilion
has
been
described
as
provocative
by
some
environmentalists
because
one
side
has
cages
of
coal
on
the
wall
with
the
slogan
black
to
green
transformation
implying
coal
can
be
used
in
a
way
that
significantly
reduces
its
carbon
emissions
qatar
is
usually
in
the
lavish
gulf
cooperation
council
pavilion
but
has
its
own
smaller
one
this
year
the
country
is
in
a
diplomatic
rift
with
other
members
and
its
leader
boycotted
a
gcc
summit
on
sunday
last
week
qatar
said
it
would
quit
opec
to
focus
on
gas
in
a
swipe
at
saudi
arabia
the
de
facto
leader
of
the
oil
exporting
group
which
is
trying
to
show
unity
in
tackling
an
oil
price
