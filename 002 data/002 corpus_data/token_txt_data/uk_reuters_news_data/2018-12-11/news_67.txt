brazil
s
future
environment
minister
under
jair
bolsonaro
said
on
monday
that
the
country
should
stay
in
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
but
the
world
must
also
respect
its
autonomy
to
set
its
environmental
policies
bolsonaro
said
on
the
campaign
trail
that
he
could
pull
out
of
the
paris
agreement
which
sets
targets
for
countries
to
reduce
the
emissions
of
greenhouse
gases
but
he
has
sent
mixed
signals
on
his
intentions
since
being
elected
saying
that
brazil
could
stay
in
the
agreement
if
certain
conditions
are
met
my
inclination
is
to
say
that
we
shouldn
t
leave
the
agreement
ricardo
salles
who
is
tipped
to
become
minister
after
bolsonaro
assumes
office
said
in
an
interview
but
on
the
other
hand
it
doesn
t
signify
that
we
will
accept
any
and
all
sanctions
restrictions
and
programs
indisputably
all
countries
must
respect
brazilian
autonomy
to
manage
its
territory
and
to
decide
its
environmental
policies
internally
he
said
brazil
has
committed
to
cutting
emissions
percent
by
and
percent
by
under
the
agreement
although
the
country
has
yet
to
fully
lay
out
how
it
will
meet
those
goals
brazil
will
use
common
sense
in
the
details
of
how
it
will
deal
with
the
agreement
and
the
country
thus
far
has
been
very
responsible
in
preserving
a
large
percent
of
its
native
vegetation
salles
said
salles
who
previously
served
as
the
top
environmental
official
for
the
state
of
sao
paulo
said
he
does
believe
climate
change
exists
although
he
could
not
say
for
sure
whether
it
is
or
a
change
that
is
occurring
naturally
brazil
should
leave
that
question
to
academics
and
get
on
with
the
less
charming
business
of
environmental
protection
he
said
including
dealing
with
waste
biodiversity
soil
issues
and
converting
the
car
fleet
to
lower
emission
biofuels
bolsonaro
will
not
cut
the
budget
of
the
ministry
and
environmental
agencies
it
oversees
which
includes
enforcer
ibama
and
conservation
area
administrator
icmbio
salles
said
but
environmental
agencies
are
not
producing
the
results
they
should
be
with
the
resources
they
are
given
and
he
said
he
will
seek
to
correct
this
mismanagement
and
asked
about
whether
brazil
should
reconsider
ibama
s
decision
last
week
to
deny
total
sa
a
permit
to
drill
in
the
sensitive
foz
do
amazonas
basin
near
the
amazon
rainforest
salles
said
they
would
have
to
make
sure
ideology
did
not
enter
into
the
decision
and
that
it
was
solely
based
on
facts
the
country
must
strike
a
balance
in
environmental
licensing
whether
for
farms
or
mines
and
development
as
overly
strict
rules
drive
people
to
illegality
or
lead
producers
to
exit
the
market
