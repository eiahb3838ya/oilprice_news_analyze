which
expanded
its
annual
capacity
to
million
tonnes
the
expansion
had
been
initially
expected
at
the
end
of

a
quicker
rise
in
output
has
raised
questions
about
yamal

yamal
lng
would
start
sales
under
a
contract
from
the
third
stage
of
the
yamal
lng
project
as
initially
planned
it
is
not
difficult
to
sell
on
the

market
the
lng
market
is
growing
by
pct
per
year
or
more
so
clients
are
asking
for
more

it
s
not
a
real
issue

we
export
more

quicker
its
good

tanker
transferred
a

to
another

off
the
tip
of
northern
norway
the
first
such
operation
that
will
help

irked
the
united
states
who
has
said
the

undercut
europe

energy
diversification
efforts
by
transferring

more
conventional

cut
in
half
