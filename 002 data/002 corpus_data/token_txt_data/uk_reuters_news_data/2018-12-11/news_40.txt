average
world
temperatures
are
on
track
to
far
exceed
the
central
goal
set
in
the
paris
agreement
on
limiting
global
warming
a
study
showed
on
tuesday
but
the
overshoot
by
the
end
of
this
century
could
be
slightly
less
severe
than
previously
expected
thanks
to
significant
efforts
by
some
countries
to
combat
climate
change
the
report
by
carbon
action
tracker
cat
a
consortium
of
three
independent
european
research
groups
said
the
paris
agreement
aims
to
restrict
warming
to
well
below
two
degrees
celsius
fahrenheit
above
times
the
cat
report
said
there
had
been
some
progress
on
the
ground
since
and
current
policies
meant
the
world
was
heading
for
warming
of
that
compared
with
the
it
predicted
a
year
ago
and
it
said
that
if
governments
were
to
implement
planned
or
extra
policies
they
had
in
the
pipeline
warming
by
could
be
limited
to
even
a
rise
of
could
cause
loss
of
tropical
coral
reefs
alpine
glaciers
arctic
summer
sea
ice
and
perhaps
an
irreversible
melt
of
greenland
s
ice
that
would
drive
up
world
sea
levels
a
united
nations
science
panel
has
said
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
said
in
october
that
keeping
the
rise
to
was
possible
but
would
require
rapid
and
unprecedented
changes
in
human
behaviour
we
have
yet
to
see
this
translate
into
action
in
terms
of
what
governments
are
prepared
to
put
on
the
table
said
bill
hare
chief
executive
of
climate
analytics
one
of
the
three
cat
research
groups
since
the
paris
accord
was
agreed
countries
including
argentina
canada
chile
and
india
plus
the
european
union
were
moving
in
the
right
direction
towards
cutting
emissions
if
extended
and
scaled
these
combined
efforts
could
begin
to
bend
the
global
emissions
curve
the
report
said
but
other
countries
such
as
the
united
states
australia
brazil
indonesia
russia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
had
made
either
no
progress
or
taken
backward
steps
