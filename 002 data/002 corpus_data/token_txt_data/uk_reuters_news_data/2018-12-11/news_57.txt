the
weakening
outlook
for
oil
consumption
coupled
with
rising
output
from
shale
and
softer
than
expected
sanctions
on
iran
have
convinced
most
traders
the
market
is
moving
into
a
period
of
oversupply
in
the
run
up
to
last
week
s
opec
meeting
in
vienna
hedge
fund
managers
had
little
confidence
in
the
organisation
s
ability
to
cut
production
by
enough
to
avoid
an
oversupplied

next

fund
managers
sold
another
million
barrels
of
brent
futures
and
options
in
the

to
bringing
total
sales
over
the
last
weeks
to
a
record
million
barrels
funds
now
hold
just
over
two
long
positions

one
down

a
ratio
of
more

bearish
short
positions
have
risen
to
million

up
from
just
million
at
the
end
of
september
and
the
largest
number
since
june
pessimism
about
the
outlook
for
crude
prices
was
reflected
by
a
similar
collapse
in
sentiment
towards
middle
distillates
such
as
gasoil
fund
managers
sold
another
million
barrels
of
european
gasoil
bringing
total

the
last
eight
weeks
to
million
barrels
funds
are
the
towards
middle
distillates
since
july
according
to
an
analysis
of
position
data
from
ice
futures
europe
middle
distillates
are
heavily
geared
towards
the
economic
cycle
because
most
distillate
fuel
oil
is
used
in
freight
transportation
shipping
railroads
aviation
trucks
manufacturing
mining
and
farming
so
the
collapse
in
sentiment
towards
distillates
is
consistent
with
growing
concerns
about
the
outlook
for
the
global
economy
in
investors
fears
about
the
impact
of
trade
tensions
and
heightened
uncertainty
on
business
investment
and
growth
next
year
is
darkening
the
outlook
for
distillates
just
as
it
is
hitting
equity
markets
expected
oversupply
of
crude
has
been
reflected
in
the
sharp
fall
in
brent
spot
prices
since
the
start
of
october
and
the
futures
curve
swinging
from
backwardation
into
contango
opec
and
selected
countries
agreed
last
week
to
cut
their
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
during
the
first
six
months
of
from
the
level
in
october
most
of
the
cuts
will
come
from
saudi
arabia
with
smaller
contributions
likely
to
come
from
russia
the
united
arab
emirates
kuwait
and
oman
other
opec
and
countries
are
unlikely
to
reduce
their
output
voluntarily
by
any
significant
amount
so
their
participation
in
the
agreement
is
mostly
symbolic
the
planned
production
cuts
reverse
the
group
s
earlier
ramp
up
in
output
and
should
offset
the
softer
enforcement
of
sanctions
on
iran
by
cutting
output
promptly
and
aggressively
may
be
able
to
avert
a
large
build
up
in
excess
oil
inventories
next
year
and
a
collapse
in
prices
similar
to
in
contrast
to
opec
has
opted
to
sacrifice
market
share
in
an
effort
to
defend
prices
at
a
higher
level
despite
the
rapid
growth
of
shale
but
there
is
little
the
group
can
do
about
the
deteriorating
economic
outlook
which
implies
the
need
for
a
period
of
lower
oil
prices
to
restrain
production
and
stimulate
consumption
to
keep
the
market
balanced
and
as
the
global
economy

from
the

war
between
the
united

and
china
rising

rates
tightening

conditions
and
a

lower

are
a
