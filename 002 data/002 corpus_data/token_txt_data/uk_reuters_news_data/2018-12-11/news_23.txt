have
devastating
consequences
if
emissions
are
not
curbed
out

speeches
over
the
next
two
days
only

the

all
need

requires
strong
political
will
by
us
leaders
climate
change
is
everyone
s
expectations
for
the
talks
are
low
political
unity
built
in
paris
has
been
shattered
by
populist
governments
that
have
placed
national
agendas
before
collective
action

angela
merkel
