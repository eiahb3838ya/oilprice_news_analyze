a
pennsylvania
administrative
law
judge
on
tuesday
denied
a
petition
by
state
residents
asking
utility
regulators
to
prohibit
the
operation
of
energy
transfer
lp
and
its
sunoco
subsidiary
s
mariner
east
pipelines
the
petition
filed
in
november
sought
interim
emergency
relief
citing
risks
from
the
pipelines
in
the
area
and
urging
the
state
s
public
utility
commission
to
direct
sunoco
to
stop
operation
of
its
mariner
east
pipeline
and
prohibit
operation
of
its
mariner
east
pipeline
the
residents
alleged
that
the
company
did
not
provide
adequate
notice
of
procedures
sufficient
to
ensure
the
safety
of
the
public
in
the
event
of
a
leak
or
rupture
according
to
the
petition
judge
elizabeth
barnes
ruled
that
the
petitioners
presented
no
evidence
of
the
risk
of
death
from
an
accidental
pipeline
leak
and
failed
to
demonstrate
a
need
for
immediate
relief
we
are
pleased
with
the
judge
s
ruling

said
in

statement
adding
that
the
company
expects
mariner
east
to
be
put
into
service
by
the
end
of
the
year
mariner
east
transports
liquids
from
the
marcellus
and
utica
shale
fields
in
western
pennsylvania
to
customers
in
the
state
and
elsewhere
including
international
exports
from

marcus
hook
complex
near
philadelphia
mariner
east
and
another
energy
transfer
project
the
rover
natural
gas
pipe
from
ohio
to
michigan
were
delayed
over
the
past
year
in
part
because
the
projects
together
racked
up
more
than
state
and
federal
permit
violations
while
the
company
raced
to
build
them
