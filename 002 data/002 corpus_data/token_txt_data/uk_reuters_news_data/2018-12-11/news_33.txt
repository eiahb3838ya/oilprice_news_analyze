as

postponed

sterling
hesitantly

after
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
abrupt
decision
to
postpone
a
parliamentary
vote
on
her
brexit
agreement
on
monday
a

that

sachs
analysts
said
volatility
across
uk
assets
has
increased
with
option
markets
pricing
a
wider
range
of
outcomes
including
brexit
without
a
deal
a
agreement
or
another
referendum
on
eu
membership
we
still
think
a
no
deal
is
a
very
low
probability
but
the
uncertainty
will
persist
for
some
time

the
first
leg
of
a
trip
to
meet
european
leaders
on
tuesday
seeking
support
for
changes
to
her
brexit
deal
while
at
home
some
lawmakers
agitated
for
a
vote
of
no
confidence
the
eu
was
adamant
the
withdrawal
agreement
including
its
most
contentious
element
a
backstop
for
the
northern
ireland
frontier
could
not
be
renegotiated
i
have
no
doubt
a
brexit
would
rank
pretty
high
on
the
list
of
market
accidents
and
have
a
global
impact

fretted
