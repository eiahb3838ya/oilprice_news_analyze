asian
jet
fuel
price
discounts
stand
at
their
lowest
december
levels
in
nine
years
as
a
supply
glut
offsets
consumption
even
as
the
region
s
aviation
sector
booms
the
slump
is
a
mirror
image
of
the
steep
gains
asian
aviation
fuel
price
differentials
saw
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
then
tight
supply
lifted
them
to
their
highest
seasonal
levels
in
a
decade
the
cash
differentials
for
jet
fuel
in
the
asian
trading
hub
of
singapore
were
at
a
discount
of
a
barrel
below
benchmark
quotes
on
monday
the
weakest
for
this
time
of
year
since
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
data
cash
differentials
represent
the

buyers
are
prepared
to
pay
for
fuel
over
or
below
benchmark
values
published
daily
by

clearly
the
physical
market
does
not
believe
that
the
high
prices
of
jet
paper
contracts
are
justified
said

consultancy
trifecta
that
is
what
is
causing
the
weakness
in
the
cash
the
weakness
also
comes
as
winter
in
the
northern
hemisphere
has
seen
a
mild
start
the
outlook
is
largely
for
an
unusually
mild
season
because
of
an
el
nino
weather
pattern
that
s
especially
the
case
in
japan
where
kerosene
almost
identical
to
jet
fuel
is
commonly
used
for
heating
the
low
kerosene
consumption
and
high
yields
for
churning
out
jet
fuel
are
luring
refiners
to
pump
out
more
of
the
latter
market
sources
said
weighing
on
the
price
traders
are
willing
to
buy
it
for
and
the
low
cash
prices
are
starting
to
weigh
on
refinery
margins
traders
said
refining
margins
also
known
as
cracks
for
jet
fuel
were
at
a
barrel
over
dubai
crude
during
asian
trading
hours
on
monday
down
percent
in
the
last
four
weeks
despite
that
jet
cracks
remain
comparatively
high
the
peak
of
a
barrel
on
was
a
near
high
and
seasonally
adjusted
refinery
cracks
for
jet
fuel
are
still
at
their
strongest
levels
for
this
time
of
the
year
since
refiners
can
take
comfort
from
the
fact
that
aviation
demand
is
really
good
jet
cracks
are
very
high
