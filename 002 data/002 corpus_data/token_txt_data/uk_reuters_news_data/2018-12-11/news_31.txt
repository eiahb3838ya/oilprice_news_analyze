brazil
s
pavilion
at
the
climate
talks
in
poland
offers
no
hint
of
the
angst
at
home
and
abroad
over
mixed
messages
on
global
warming
from
its
but
campaign
promises
made
by
jair
bolsonaro
that
could
weaken
protection
for
the
amazon
rainforest
are
a
hot
topic
of
conversation
among
visitors
said
caio
henrique
scarmocin
one
of
three
hosts
on
the
stand
at
the
conference
whose
outcome
will
be
key
to
implementing
the
landmark
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
scientists
and
environmental
activists
said
they
were
laying
the
groundwork
should
calls
for
bolsonaro
to
protect
brazil
s
forests
fail
campaign
statements
from
bolsonaro
who
takes
power
in
january
suggested
indigenous
lands
could
be
opened
up
to
economic
exploitation
including
agribusiness
and
mining
and
environmental
fines
eased
the
ability
of
ibama
brazil
s
environmental
protection
agency
to
fine
those
who
break
environmental
laws
is
one
of
the
government
s
best
defences
against
the
destruction
of
forests
stoking
fears
of
a
deforestation
spike
under
the
new
government
bolsonaro
who
campaigned
on
a
platform
also
pushed
the
brazilian
government
to
withdraw
its
offer
to
host
next
year
s
climate
conference
he
has
a
hostile
approach
over
environmental
issues
said
paulo
barreto
a
researcher
with
imazon
a
brazilian
institute
monitoring
deforestation
in
the
amazon
brazil
is
home
to
about
percent
of
the
amazon
rainforest
considered
by
many
as
nature
s
best
weapon
against
global
warming
because
trees
absorb
and
store
carbon
from
the
air
alfredo
sirkis
executive
secretary
of
the
brazilian
forum
on
climate
change
said
he
thought
dialogue
with
the
incoming
government
was
still
possible
but
if
environmental
proceed
there
was
a
contingency
plan
he
told
journalists
a
coalition
would
assemble
regional
governments
committed
to
respecting
brazil
s
emissions
reduction
goals
set
under
the
paris
pact
said
sirkis
governors
in
as
many
as
seven
brazilian
states
including
amazonas
pernambuco
the
federal
district
espirito
santo
parana
and
rio
grande
do
sul
had
already
expressed
interest
in
joining
he
said
this
is
for
starters
said
the
former
congressman
a
spokesman
for
the
presidency
of
brazil
at
the
climate
talks
declined
to
comment
the
plan
has
similarities
with
we
are
still
in
a
group
of
more
than
mayors
governors
and
business
leaders
who
have
promised
they
will
not
retreat
from
the
paris
deal
last
year
president
donald
trump
gave
notice
the
united
states
would
leave
the
accord
although
it
can
not
formally
withdraw
until
arguing
it
was
bad
for
the
economy
mauricio
voivodic
executive
director
of
said
his
group
had
been
in
touch
with
the
campaign
through
which
is
part
of
the
we
are
still
in
secretariat
the
american
coalition
has
its
own
pavilion
at
the
climate
talks
we
are
learning
from
we
are
still
in
the
importance
of
governments
and
companies
enhancing
commitments
for
the
implementation
of
the
paris
agreement
voivodic
said
but
is
not
yet
trying
to
emulate
the
model
because
it
wants
to
prioritise
dialogue
already
underway
with
the
transition
government
he
added
it
could
be
an
option
but
we
are
not
going
in
the
direction
of
starting
planning
this
said
voivodic
brazil
s
future
environment
minister
told
reuters
on
monday
his
inclination
was
not
to
leave
the
paris
agreement
after
bolsonaro
said
on
the
campaign
trail
he
might
quit
the
deal
under
which
countries
set
their
own
targets
to
cut
emissions
marcio
astrini
public
policy
coordinator
for
greenpeace
brazil
said
he
also
looked
to
the
united
states
as
a
vague
blueprint
to
build
a
similar
resistance
movement
a
brazilian
version
would
draw
on
linkages
between
about
civil
society
groups
who
worked
closely
over
the
last
year
to
oppose
bolsonaro
s
campaign
he
said
also
mirroring
tactics
used
in
the
united
states
his
group
does
not
exclude
filing
lawsuits
to
push
back
against
potential
weakening
of
environmental
and
climate
regulations
in
brazil
it
on
the
table
he
said
adding
that
it
was
still
a
option
