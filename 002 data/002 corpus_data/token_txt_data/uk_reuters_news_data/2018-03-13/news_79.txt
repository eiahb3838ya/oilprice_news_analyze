hedge
funds
have
resumed
liquidating
their
bullish
long
positions
in
crude
oil
and
refined
fuels
amid
more
signs
that
the
earlier
rally
in
prices
has
fizzled

six

linked
to
petroleum
prices
by

largely
reversed

increase
of
million

the
previous
week
according
to

records
published
by

portfolio
managers
have
now
reduced
their
net
long
position
in
petroleum
in
five
of
the
last
six
weeks
by
a
total
of
million
barrels

the

some
of
the
froth
has
blown
off
the

in
the
last
six
weeks
but
the
hedge
fund
community
still
has
a
very
bullish
bias
towards
oil
prices
fund
managers
hold
a
net
long
position
in
the
six
major
petroleum
contracts
amounting
to
million
barrels
of
oil
a
level
of
bullishness
that
had
never
been
seen
until
four
months
ago
long
positions
still
outnumbered
short
positions
by
a
ratio
of
down
from
a
peak
of
almost
in
january
but
again
a
level
of
bullishness
that
was
unprecedented
until
this
year
with
so
many
long
positions
already
established
and
few
remaining
short
positions
to
cover
oil
prices
have
struggled
to
rise
further
in
recent
weeks
instead
the
market
has
seen
a
slow
but
steady
liquidation
with
existing
longs
cut
by
a
total
of
almost
million
barrels
percent
since
it
remains
uncertain
whether
this
is
merely
a
pause
and
the
price
rally
will
resume
shortly
or
whether
it
marks
a
temporary
peak
with
more
liquidation
and
price
falls
to
come
but
the
balance
of
risks
remains
tilted
towards
the
downside
in
the
short
term
given
the
huge
number
of
long

still
hanging
