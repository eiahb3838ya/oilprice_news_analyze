crude
oil
is
likely
to
spring
to
mind
if
one
is
asked
to
name
a
commodity
where
the
united
states
is
disrupting
the
market
by
becoming
a
swing
producer
and
challenging
traditional
trade
flows
especially
in
asian
markets
but
it
s
increasingly
likely
that
the
united
states
is
about
to
play
the
same
role
in
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
as
it
ramps
up
production
in
an
already
market
much
has
been
written
recently
about
how
the
expected
glut
in
lng
supply
is
unlikely
to
materialise
given
the
rapid
growth
of
demand
for
the
fuel
in
asia
especially
in
china
which
is
now
second
only
to
japan
as
an
importer
major
producer
royal
dutch
shell
warned
last
month
of
an
impending
supply
gap
that
will
need
more
than
billion
of
investment
by
as
the
natural
gas
market
grows
faster
than
that
for
any
other
source
of
energy
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
shell
s
bullish
forecast
and
there
is
certainly
renewed
interest
around
the
world
in
developing
lng
projects
to
meet
forecast
demand
investment
in
lng
projects
fell
off
a
cliff
in
recent
years
as
the
industry
dealt
with
the
ramifications
of
rapid
supply
growth
which
has
seen
australia
add
eight
new
plants
while
the
united
states
is
busy
commissioning
the
second
of
its
new
export
projects
with
five
more
to
come
by
while
shell
and
others
may
well
be
correct
about
the
need
for
new
plants
to
meet
demand
by
it
s
the
next
couple
of
years
that
could
prove
challenging
for
the
lng
industry
most
of
the
new
capacity
built
in
australia
was
done
under
the
old
industry
model
where
offtake
contracts
often
linked
to
crude
oil
prices
allowed
for
the
financing
of
billions
of
dollars
of
capital
investment
with
extended
payback
terms
the
model
has
been
somewhat
different
in
the
united
states
with
far
less
of
the
upcoming
production
committed
to
buyers
meaning
more
will
be
sold
at
spot
prices
linked
to
benchmark
henry
hub
natural
gas
this
is
where
the
role
of
the
united
states
in
lng
starts
to
look
eerily
similar
to
the
role
its
shale
oil
producers
are
playing
in
crude
oil
markets
traditional
exporters
such
as
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
found
it
tougher
than
expected
to
push
crude
oil
prices
higher
mainly
because
customers
especially
in
asia
have
been
able
to
turn
to
alternative
suppliers
while
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
its
allies
including
russia
have
met
some
success
in
draining
excess
global
crude
inventories
it
s
come
at
the
expense
of
market
share
in
the
asian
demand
region
this
can
be
seen
in
the
customs
data
for
china
the
world
s
largest
crude
importer
in
saudi
arabia
s
share
of
china
s
imports
was
percent
a
drop
from
percent
the
prior
year
the
share
enjoyed
by
the
united
states
meanwhile
rose
from
percent
to
percent
while
the
united
states
is
far
from
a
major
threat
to
saudi
arabia
in
asia
when
you
add
in
gains
by
other
smaller
exporters
not
part
of
the
opec
and
allies
deal
it
starts
to
add
up
brazil
s
share
of
china
s
crude
imports
rose
from
percent
in
to
percent
last
year
shipments
from
britain
went
from
percent
to
percent
in
just
as
shale
as
roiled
crude
oil
markets
it
s
likely
that
shale
gas
will
have
the
same
effect
at
least
until
demand
growth
eliminates
the
coming
supply
surplus
the
united
states
will
add
about
million
tonnes
of
annual
capacity
by
assuming
all
the
projects
currently
under
construction
are
delivered
on
schedule
china
sourced
percent
of
its
lng
from
australia
and
percent
from
qatar
in
and
just
percent
from
the
united
states
but
china
s
imports
of
million
tonnes
of
lng
from
the
united
states
in
was
percent
higher
than
for
the
previous
year
and
the
risk
is
that
as
new
output
comes
online
it
will
aggressively
compete
in
asia
while
chinese
demand
for
lng
has
surprised
to
the
upside
with
growth
of
percent
to
million
tonnes
in
it
still
may
be
a
challenge
for
the
market
to
absorb
all
the
additional
tonnes
not
just
from
the
united
states
but
also
from
smaller
projects
mainly
in
africa
like
the
rise
of
shale
oil
as
an
export
force
the
coming
lng
wave
will
disrupt
traditional
flows
across
the
globe
similar
to
shale
oil
lng
is
being
produced
and
exported
from
the
atlantic
basin
but
the
overwhelming
growth
in
demand
is
in
asia
while
lng
will
be
competitive
in
latin
america
it
also
will
likely
displace
cargoes
from
qatar
in
europe
meaning
the
world
s
top
producer
of
lng
will
be
forced
to
sell
more
in
asia
just
as
australia
is
snapping
at
its
heels
for
bragging
rights
at
the
biggest
exporter
a
shift
to
more
flexible
contracts
will
see
traditional
relationships
stretched
as
will
the
increasing
activities
of
trading
houses
keen
to
get
in
on
the
market
seasonal
demand
volatility
particularly
from
china
will
also
serve
to
test
the
market
with
the
likelihood
that
the
winter
peak
will
be
bigger
than
before
with
the
attendant
risk
that
the
shoulder
seasons
either
side
of
cold
weather
will
be
weaker
overall
the
lng
market
is
going
to
have
to
adapt
to
the
arrival
of
production
but
where
liquefied
gas
differs
from
crude
oil
is
in
not
having
an
established
producer
group
that
can
coordinate
