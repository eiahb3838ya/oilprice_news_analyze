s
chief
executive
said
on

the

provided

tariff
relief
on

imports
sean

largest
steel
manufacturer
added
that
the
government
must
put
resources
in
place
to

decided
last

to
impose
a
percent
tariffs
on
steel
imports
asked
if
his
company
would
seek
government
aid
donnelly
replied
canada
is
the
biggest
supplier
of
steel
and
aluminum
to
the
united
states
but
the
steel
sector
accounted
for
only
direct
jobs
and
represented
percent
of
exports
last
year

said
speaking
to

trudeau
said
he
was
aware
of
concerns
that
countries
now
faced
with
tariffs
could
try
to
get
their
steel
to
the
north
american
market
through
canada
and
the
government
was
working
with
the
industry
and
united
states
to
prevent
that
that
is
a
concern
that
we
share
with
the
americans
and
we
re
going
to
keep
ensuring
that
canadian
steel
is
canadian
steel

the
meeting

was
an
important
affirmation
