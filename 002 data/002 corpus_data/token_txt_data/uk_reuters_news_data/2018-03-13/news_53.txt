oil
giants
royal
dutch
shell
and
eni
have
voluntarily
filed
to
authorities
internal
probes
into
how
they
acquired
a
giant
field
in
nigeria
as
the
companies
seek
to
fight
corruption
allegations
in
europe
and
africa
the
filings
to
the
department
of
justice
doj
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
sec
do
not
mean
authorities
are
investigating
shell
or
eni
but
the
move
shows
the
companies
are
trying
to
preempt
questions
from
the
united
states
as
they
face
one
of
the
oil
industry
s
graft
trials
in
italy
to
begin
in
may
in
milan
a
pending
trial
in
nigeria
and
an
investigation
in
the
netherlands
the
case
revolves
around
the
purchase
of
a
huge
block
off
nigeria
known
as
opl
which
holds
an
estimated
billion
barrels
in
reserves
italian
prosecutors
allege
that
bribes
were
paid
in
an
effort
to
secure
rights
to
the
block
in
a
number
of
top
executives
from
both
companies
including
eni
chief
executive
claudio
descalzi
and
former
shell
foundation
chairman
malcolm
brinded
will
face
trial
under
italian
law
a
company
can
be
held
responsible
if
it
is
deemed
to
have
failed
to
prevent
or
attempt
to
prevent
a
crime
by
an
employee
that
benefited
the
company
both
companies
shares
are
traded
on
stock
exchanges
putting
their
foreign
dealings
in
the
scope
of
authorities
shell
and
eni
on
behalf
of
subsidiaries
in
entered
deferred
prosecution
agreements
with
the
doj
over
separate
nigerian
corruption
allegations
those
pacts
dismissed
charges
after
a
certain
period
in
exchange
for
fines
and
an
agreement
to
fulfil
a
number
of
requirements
they
concluded
in
and
respectively
a
company
s
disclosure
of
alleged
foreign
corruption
to
both
the
sec
and
the
doj
in
the
typically
means
the
company
believed
authorities
needed
to
be
made
aware
of
this
and
both
agencies
have
the
authority
to
prosecute
under
the
foreign
corrupt
practices
act
or
fcpa
said
pablo
quiñones
executive
director
of
the
new
york
university
school
of
law
program
on
corporate
compliance
and
enforcement
quiñones
previously
worked
as
chief
of
strategy
policy
and
training
at
the
doj
s
criminal
fraud
section
a
role
that
included
helping
to
develop
fcpa
enforcement
policy
the
sec
and
the
doj
declined
to
comment
on
the
company
disclosures
or
whether
they
were
looking
into
any
allegations
surrounding
the
block
eni
noted
its
disclosure
in
an
sec
filing
in
which
it
said
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
on
eni
side
were
detected
shell
has
said
publicly
that
it
submitted
the
investigation
to
authorities
and
to
britain
s
serious
fraud
office
shell
and
eni
deny
any
wrongdoing
they
say
their
payments
for
the
block
a
total
of
billion
were
transparent
legal
and
went
directly
into
an
escrow
account
controlled
by
the
nigerian
government
the
companies
and
legal
experts
say
the
trial
will
last
more
than
a
year
with
potential
appeals
stretching
several
years
beyond
that
the
risk
for
companies
is
of
a
prolonged
period
of
exposure
to
open
court
allegations
from
a
state
prosecutor
of
impropriety
anthony
goldman
of
pm
consulting
said
that
will
be
painful
and
the
milan
prosecutor
charges
that
roughly
billion
of
the
payments
were
funnelled
to
a
nigerian
company
called
malabu
oil
and
gas
which
had
a
disputed
claim
on
the
block
and
former
oil
minister
dan
etete
who
british
and
courts
have
said
controlled
malabu
reuters
has
been
unable
to
reach
etete
or
malabu
for
comment
shell
has
since
said
it
knew
some
of
the
money
would
go
to
malabu
to
settle
its
claim
though
its
own
due
diligence
could
not
confirm
who
controlled
the
company
eni
said
it
never
dealt
with
etete
or
knew
he
controlled
the
company
but
that
the
government
promised
to
settle
all
other
claims
on
the
block
as
part
of
their
deal
if
the
evidence
ultimately
proves
that
improper
payments
were
made
by
malabu
or
others
to
then
current
government
officials
in
exchange
for
improper
conduct
relating
to
the
settlement
of
the
long
standing
legal
disputes
it
is
shell
s
position
that
none
of
those
payments
were
made
with
its
knowledge
authorisation
or
on
its
behalf
shell
said
in
a
statement
the
proceedings
have
also
brought
together
investigators
in
several
countries
with
authorities
in
nigeria
and
the
netherlands
sending
information
to
milan
a
dutch
team
in
raided
shell
offices
as
part
of
the
investigation
and
a
dutch
law
firm
has
asked
prosecutors
to
consider
launching
a
criminal
case
in
the
netherlands
i
m
not
aware
of
many
cases
where
this
many
jurisdictions
have
been
at
work
for
so
long
helping
each
other
out
the
amount
of
cooperation
is
very
unusual
said
aaron
sayne
of
the
natural
resource
governance
institute
a
group
that
advises
countries
on
how
to
manage
oil
gas
and
mineral

a

financial
watchdog

and
financial

against
defendants
including
the
former
attorney
general
of
justice
and
oil
and
various
senior
managers
current
and
former
from
shell
and
eni
will
continue
in
june
there
has
also
been
at
least
one
effort
to
take
away
the
asset
experts
say
it
is
worth
billions
and
shell
has
spent
millions
developing
it
eni
intends
to
make
a
final
investment
decision
this
year
on
developing
the
block
and
said
in
corporate
filings
that
the
asset
has
a
book
value
of
billion
euros
billion
the
italian
court
does
not
have
the
ability
to
rescind
rights
to
the
block
and
nigerian
oil
minister
emmanuel
ibe
kachikwu
has
said
the
companies
should
continue
to
develop
it
but
in
a
lawsuit
filed
by
the
nigerian
government
against
jpmorgan
in
london
for
the
bank
role
in
transferring
money
from
the
deal
it
called
the
agreement
that
facilitated
shell
and
eni
purchase
unlawful
and
void
a
jpmorgan
spokeswoman
previously
said
the
firm
considers
the
allegations
made
in
the
claim
to
be
unsubstantiated
and
without
merit
additionally
a
nigerian
court
last
year
briefly
ordered
the
seizure
of
the
block
that
decision
was
later
overturned
and
shell
and
eni
say
they
are
not
worried
about
losing
the
asset
but
the
ruling
and
the
language
in
the
government
suit
against
jpmorgan
underscore
the
risk
it
s
a
nice
stable
asset
that
could
produce
a
lot
of
oil
for
a
long
time
