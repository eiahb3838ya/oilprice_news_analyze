south
african
president
cyril
ramaphosa
was
dealt
a
political
blow
on
tuesday
after
a
legal
challenge
by
a
group
loyal
to
ousted
leader
jacob
zuma
blocked
the
signing
of
billion
in
renewable
energy
deals
the
north
gauteng
high

to
hold
a
full
hearing
on
the

a
group
which
has
lobbied
for

the

on
monday
argued
the

would
lead
to
job

was
due

and
solar
deals
with
independent
power
producers
ipps
in
the
first
major
investment
deal
since
ramaphosa
replaced
zuma
last
month
we
are
confident
that
the
court
will
recognise
that
our
rights
have
been
violated
numsa
said
the
projects
were
delayed
for
two
years
under
zuma
as
he
pursued
a
billion
nuclear
power
plan
ramaphosa
a
wealthy
businessman
has
made
revamping
the
economy
a
top
priority
but
many
investors
are
concerned
about
his
ability
to
push
through
reforms
given
deep
divisions
in
the
ruling
african
national
congress
anc
zuma
reluctantly
resigned
last
month
under
sustained
pressure
from
sections
of
the
anc
but
his
allies
remain
in
roles
in
the
party
and
are
opposed
to
ramaphosa
given
our
history
it
is
natural
that
you
suspect
ulterior
political
motives
in
the
court
application

wrote
a

to

told
reuters
we
are
opposed
to
the
prohibitive
cost
of
the
ipp
the
energy
ministry
said
in
a
statement
it
decided
not
to
sign
the
contracts
until
after
the
court
ruling
and
reaffirmed
its
commitment
to
expanding
green
energy
programmes
some
investors
remained
positive
i
m
still
fairly
optimistic
these
deals
will
be
signed
when
you
look
at
the
cold
hard
facts
about
our
economy
these
are
the
sort
of
deals
that
need
to
be
done
wills
said
numsa
and
transform
rsa
argue
that
a
switch
to
renewable
energy
would
increase
electricity
costs
for
poor
south
africans
energy
analyst
chris
yelland
however
said
the
cost
of
renewable
energy
had
fallen
significantly
and
it
was
now
cheaper
than
new
coal
and
nuclear
projects
south
africa
relies
on
plants
for
more
than
percent
of
its
electricity
generation
while
renewables
contribute
around
percent
eskom
is
one
of
the
world
s
largest
producers
of
greenhouse
gases
ultimately
this
application
is
futile
and
economic
sense
will
prevail
south
africa
must
transform
from
a
dirty
energy
economy
to
a
cleaner
energy
economy
yelland
said
south
africa
s
renewable
power
programme
was
the
in
the
world
seven
years
ago
attracting
billion
of
investment
into
wind
farms
and
solar
projects
involving
a
cluster
of
new
ipps
backed
by
foreign
investment
over
the
past
two
years
eskom
stopped
signing
renewable
energy
contracts
and
focused
instead
on
a
plan
to
build
a
fleet
of
nuclear
power
plants
in
a
deal
that
some
members
of
the
anc
and

groups
said
would
be
open
to
corruption
