reuters
and
european
stock
indexes
closed
down
on
tuesday
pressured
by
losses
in
technology
stocks
and
president
donald
trump
s
ouster
of
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
sagging
equities
in
turn
weighed
on
the
dollar
and
crude
oil
prices
the
possibility
of
additional
tariffs
on
china
which
made
news
late
in
the
day
may
have
also
dragged
stocks
down
across
sectors
technology
rallied
hard
yesterday
and
last
week
and
there
is
but
it
s
just
a
pressure
said
ken
polcari
director
of
the
nyse
floor
division
at

neil
securities
in
new
york
falling
stock
prices
pressured
oil
futures
which
fell
as
much
as
percent
before
regaining
some
ground
oil
lately
has
trended
in
tandem
with
equities
and
remains
under
pressure
from
nagging
concerns
over
rising
production
trump
gave
tillerson
the
boot
after
a
series
of
public
rifts
over
policy
on
north
korea
russia
and
iran
and
replaced
his
chief
diplomat
with
central
intelligence
agency
director
mike
pompeo
the
move
contributed
to
a
volatile
morning
across
asset
classes
but
markets
began
trending
decidedly
in
the
red
by
the
afternoon
crude
fell
percent
to
per
barrel
brent
was
last
at
down
percent
on
the
day
energy
investors
initially
saw
tillerson
s
firing
as
a
sign
that
a
deal
on
iran
s
nuclear
program
could
collapse
potentially
cutting
that
country
s
oil
output
this
view
supported
prices
for
awhile
but
could
not
overcome
lingering
fears
about
rising
production
there
s
no
stopping
us
and
opec
s
frustration
levels
are
going
to
grow
said
phillip
streible
senior
market
strategist
at
rjo
futures
in
chicago
referring
to
efforts
by
major
producers
to
curb
output
crude
output
has
reached
a
record
and
weekly
data
last
week
showed
overall
output
rising
further
the

fell

the

dropped

slid
as
shares

down
more

each
top
losers
on

and
the
nasdaq
equity
markets
had
opened
higher
after
the
labor
department
announced
its
consumer
price
index
rose
percent
in
february
the
data
in
line
with
economists
expectations
suggested
the
federal
reserve
remains
on
track
to
raise
interest
rates
at
a
gradual
pace
but
there
s
a
lot
of
noise
coming
out
of
washington
over
all
these
changes
that
s
causing
the
markets
to
really
not
focus
said
ken
polcari
director
of
the
nyse
floor
division
at
o
neil
securities
in
new
york
potentially
compounding
the
strain
were
revelations
that
trump
is
seeking
to
impose
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
imports
and
will
target
the
technology
and
telecommunications
sectors
i
don
t
think
china
wants
to
engage
in
a
tariff
war
however
this
may
be
upsetting
the
apple
cart
said
bryan
novak
senior
managing
director
at

investment
management
in

there
could
be
some
anxiety
around
it
it
s
really
hard
to
place
value
on
this
right
