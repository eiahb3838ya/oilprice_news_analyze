saudi aramco international listing looks increasingly difficult - sources
reuters
saudi
arabia
is
increasingly
looking
to
just
float
oil
giant
saudi
aramco
locally
as
plans
for
an
initial
public
offering
ipo
on
an
international
exchange
such
as
london
or
new
york
hang
in
the
balance
sources
close
to
the
process
said
the
kingdom
is
counting
on
being
awarded
emerging
market
status
by
index
complier
msci
in
june
to
help
saudi
aramco
attract
western
funds
in
addition
to
cornerstone
investors
from
china
japan
and
south
korea
the
sources
said
i
would
guess
it
is
about
evens
that
there
will
be
no
international
ipo
said
a
source
familiar
with
the
preparations
saying
they
were
proving
to
be
a
disappointment
saudi
arabia
is
planning
to
list
up
to
percent
of
saudi
aramco
in
an
initial
public
offering
that
could
value
it
at
up
to
trillion
and
make
it
the
world
s
biggest
oil
company
by
market
capitalisation
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
last
week
that
aramco
was
too
important
to
risk
listing
in
the
united
states
because
of
litigation
concerns
such
as
existing
lawsuits
against
rival
oil
companies
for
their
role
in
climate
change
british
officials
have
been
told
by
saudi
counterparts
london
has
a
chance
to
secure
the
listing
but
only
in
at
the
earliest
according
to
the
financial
times
and
sources
told
reuters
the
kingdom
was
now
focusing
on
a
listing
on
the
local
exchange
or
tadawul
the
only
thing
we
know
today
is
that
tadawul
will
be
the
key
listing
location
as
our
national
exchange
falih
told
cnn
we
are
waiting
for
the
reforms
to
be
in
place
and
to
join
msci
and
aramco
listing
in
tadawul
will
be
catalytic
for
that
capital
market
as
we
bring
international
capital
to
the
kingdom
he
told
the
channel
last
week
the
initial
public
offering
is
the
centrepiece
of
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
s
plan
to
diversify
the
saudi
economy
beyond
oil
and
it
would
also
boost
the
kingdom
s
budget
which
has
been
hit
by
low
oil
prices
initially
planned
for
preparations
have
been
hit
by
rows
over
whether
aramco
should
list
on
major
western
markets
at
all
an
advisory
council
to
the
government
asked
the
securities
regulator
this
year
to
study
the
impact
of
a
local
listing
amid
concern
a
huge
ipo
could
harm
the
market
msci
has
proposed
giving
its
existing
saudi
arabia
stock
index
emerging
market
status
rather
than
standalone
status
following
a
series
of
market
reforms
by
the
kingdom
such
as
raising
caps
on
foreign
ownership
of
companies
msci
will
give
its
decision
in
june
and
if
positive
the
reclassification
would
be
in
two
steps
in
may
and
august
according
to
an
update
of
the
msci
proposal
published
in
february
saudi
arabia
would
have
a
market
capitalisation
of
billion
billion
in
msci
s
emerging
markets
index
giving
it
an
index
weight
of
percent
on
a
par
with
thailand
based
on
the
assumption
that
another
billion
would
be
added
through
an
aramco
initial
public
offering
the
kingdom
s
weighting
would
rise
to
about
percent
which
would
be
bigger
than
russia
s
weighting
of
percent
for
example
if
msci
grants
saudi
arabia
emerging
market
status
it
could
be
seen
as
a
reason
to
push
against
an
international
listing
the
sources
close
to
the
listing
process
said
passive
investment
funds
that
replicate
msci
indexes
would
need
to
put
percent
of
their
funds
allocated
to
emerging
market
indexes
into
saudi
shares
to
match
the
country
weighting
according
to
msci
trillion
of
assets
were
benchmarked
against
msci
emerging
market
indexes
at
the
end
of
june
last
year
of
which
about
a
fifth
was
from
passive
investors
that
could
mean
billion
could
come
into
saudi
stocks
from
passive
investors
and
if
active
investors
also
increased
their
saudi
exposure
to
the
weighting
following
an
aramco
ipo
the
total
inflows
could
be
billion
data
published
in
march
by
fund
tracking
firm
epfr
global
funds
found
evidence
that
investors
have
warmed
to
saudi
arabia
in
recent
weeks
looking
at
single
country
equity
funds
saudi
arabia
attracted
record
setting
flows
as
investors
looked
for
alternatives
to
russia
and
turkey
the
data
showed
graphic
aramco
suitors
with
the
prospect
of
a
listing
in
london
and
new
york
receding
sources
familiar
with
the
ipo
told
reuters
that
hong
kong
was
now
emerging
as
an
increasingly
likely
compromise
because
riyadh
wants
to
help
asian
nations
that
are
expected
to
become
cornerstone
investors
while
london
is
preferred
over
new
york
the
requirement
by
both
for
greater
disclosure
of
sensitive
information
on
aramco
than
the
hong
kong
exchange
is
viewed
as
a
drawback
by
some
saudi
officials
and
advisers
the
sources
said
saudi
aramco
said
on
monday
it
was
still
reviewing
its
options
for
the
initial
public
offering
a
final
decision
will
be
made
by
mohammed
bin
salman
who
oversees
the
kingdom
s
economic
and
oil
policies
sources
have
told
reuters
it
requires
a
bourse
at
least
six
month
to
prepare
for
a
listing
so
a
decision
would
need
to
be
taken
in
april
for
the
ipo
to
go
ahead
this
year
tadawul
s
chief
said
in
october
that
his
exchange
hoped
to
be
the
only
venue
but
with
a
total
capitalisation
of
about
billion
it
could
struggle
to
absorb
aramco
without
the
participation
of
foreign
funds
sources
close
to
the
process
however
said
even
with
emerging
market
status
aramco
would
struggle
to
raise
billion
locally
bankers
and
analysts
said
an
aramco
float
risked
drowning
out
other
shares
listed
on
tadawul
given
daily
turnover
now
is
about
billion
they
can
do
a
nominal
to
percent
listing
