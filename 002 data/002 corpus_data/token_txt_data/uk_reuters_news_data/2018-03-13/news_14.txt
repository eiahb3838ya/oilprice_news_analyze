greens fear climate backslide with pompeo as top u.s. diplomat
washington
reuters
several
green
groups
criticized
the
trump
administration
s
choice
on
tuesday
of
cia
director
mike
pompeo
to
replace
rex
tillerson
as
secretary
of
state
saying
his
past
skeptical
comments
about
global
warming
show
he
is
less
suited
to
run
foreign
policy
about
climate
change
than
the
former
exxon
mobil
ceo
pompeo
who
was
a
republican
congressman
from
kansas
prior
to
running
the
cia
under
president
donald
trump
has
been
among
the
biggest
critics
of
efforts
to
combat
global
warming
by
past
administrations
and
has
questioned
the
validity
of
existing
climate
science
saying
it
needs
to
be
developed
further
in
this
position
pompeo
could
prove
to
be
dangerous
to
our
national
security
and
the
safety
of
our
planet
said
michael
brune
executive
director
of
the
sierra
club
some
climate
advocates
said
however
they
hoped
the
long
slate
of
issues
facing
the
state
department
now
from
north
korea
s
nuclear
agenda
to
intensifying
trade
disputes
would
keep
climate
change
low
on
pompeo
s
list
of
priorities
should
he
be
confirmed
by
the
senate
right
now
climate
change
is
not
going
to
be
a
top
issue
for
him
said
andrew
light
a
former
adviser
to
todd
stern
the
special
envoy
on
climate
change
under
obama
pompeo
is
also
a
top
recipient
of
campaign
donations
from
koch
industries
having
taken
over
from
the
energy
conglomerate
for
campaigns
going
back
to
according
to
data
from
the
center
for
responsive
politics
a
transparency
watchdog
koch
industries
has
donated
millions
of
dollars
to
efforts
opposing
climate
change
regulation
his
background
upsets
many
environmentalists
but
dovetails
neatly
with
trump
s
energy
agenda
to
roll
back
climate
regulations
and
support
domestic
production
of
coal
and
crude
oil
the
fossil
fuels
that
scientists
blame
for
global
warming
trump
has
repeatedly
bashed
international
efforts
to
combat
climate
change
and
has
at
times
called
global
warming
a
hoax
tillerson
had
also
faced
stern
opposition
from
environmentalists
when
he
was
nominated
as
secretary
of
state
given
his
years
at
the
helm
of
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
oil
and
gas
companies
but
he
had
tried
to
be
a
moderating
influence
on
trump
over
climate
policy
during
his
tenure
for
example
tillerson
advocated
continued
cooperation
regarding
the
paris
climate
agreement
a
global
deal
to
fight
warming
a
battle
he
lost
when
trump
announced
in
june
the
intention
to
withdraw
the
state
department
has
since
continued
to
send
delegations
to
international
climate
summits
where
envoys
have
been
perceived
by
their
foreign
counterparts
as
constructive
we
ve
gone
from
exxon
s
ceo
to
the
koch
brothers
most
loyal
lapdog
said
may
boeve
executive
director
for
climate
activist
group
billionaire
brothers
charles
and
david
koch
own
koch
industries
environmental
groups
like
greenpeace
and
the
sierra
club
issued
similar
statements
calling
the
nomination
a
potential
step
backwards
koch
industries
did
not
immediately
comment
and
efforts
to
reach
pompeo
were
not
successful
officials
at
the
white
house
and
the
state
department
did
not
immediately
comment
on
whether
pompeo
would
be
expected
to
update
climate
change
policy
tillerson
was
basically
on
the
issue
of
climate
change
said
alden
meyer
director
of
strategy
and
policy
for
the
union
of
concerned
scientists
it
is
not
clear
it
is
going
to
be
any
more
of
a
priority
