the
environmental
protection
agency
granted
a
bankrupt
philadelphia
oil
refining
company
a
reprieve
from
complying
with
the
nation
s
renewable
fuel
laws
according
to
a
settlement
agreement
filed
on
monday
the
refiner
carlyle
philadelphia
energy
solutions
pes
filed
for
bankruptcy
protection
in
january
and
asked
a
judge
to
waive
some
million
in
compliance
costs
under
the
renewable
fuel
standard
or
rfs
the
epa
and
pes
agreed
on
monday
that
the
refiner
would
only
have
to
satisfy
about
half
those
costs
but
would
face
more
scrutiny
moving
forward
court
documents
showed
the
settlement
is
facing
early
opposition
from
ethanol
groups
the
settlement
comes
amid
a
fight
between
powerful
corn
and
oil
interests
in
washington
over
the
future
of
the
rfs
program
president
donald
trump
has
sought
to
bring
the
two
sides
together
in
recent
weeks
to
come
up
with
reforms
that
can
lower
the
cost
for
refiners
without
hurting
demand
for
biofuels
wading
into
an
issue
that
divides
two
important
constituencies
the
pes
bankruptcy
and
the
potential
loss
of
jobs
in
a
key
electoral
state
had
fueled
calls
for
change
the
rfs
requires
refiners
to
blend
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
their
fuel
or
buy
credits
from
those
who
do
pes
which
lacks
blending
facilities
entered
into
bankruptcy
owing
million
credits
from
and
with
only
million
credits
in
hand
the
filing
showed
the
epa
said
pes
could
comply
with
the
program
by
turning
over
its
available
credits
and
would
be
excused
from
any
shortfall
a
huge
win
for
the
refiner
it
said
the
deal
would
cover
the
company
up
until
the
point
it
exits
bankruptcy
after
exiting
bankruptcy
pes
would
have
to
comply
with
the
law
on
a
basis
as
opposed
to
annually
and
submit
itself
to
more
epa
scrutiny
it
would
face
penalties
for
with
the
agreement
neither
epa
nor
pes
responded
to
requests
for
comment
pes
has
blamed
its
financial
woes
on
the
cost
of
buying
the
but
reuters
reported
that
other
factors
may
also
have
played
a
role
in
the
bankruptcy
including
the
withdrawal
of
more
than
million
in
payments
from
the
company
by
its
investor
owners
the
private
equity
firm
carlyle
group
rescued
the
refinery
from
shutting
in
putting
up
million
for
majority
control
of
the
company
the
majority
of
the
dividends
paid
to
the
investor
group
were
backed
by
loans
taken
against
the
refinery
s
assets
the
deal
will
be
open
for
public
comment
for
days
before
it
is
finalized
and
biofuel
groups
are
showing
early
opposition
under
this
settlement
it
looks
like
the
carlyle
group
gets
to
keep
that
cash
while
avoiding
investing
in
biofuels
and
job
security
for
philadelphia
workers
if
that
s
the
case
this
is
a
massive
handout
brooke
coleman
head
of
the
advanced
biofuels
council
said
bob
dinneen
ceo
of
the
renewable
fuels
association
said
the
group
was
still
evaluating
the
settlement
but
at
first
blush
this
strikes
us
as
rewarding
bombast
behavior
and
it
sets
an
extraordinarily
bad
the
case
is
kg

the
bankruptcy
court

the
district
