the
dollar
fell
on
tuesday
and
share
markets
flinched
as
news
broke
that
president
donald
trump
had
ousted
yet
another
of
his
top
team
this
time
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
trump
said
on
twitter
he
was
replacing
the
former
oil
executive
tillerson
with
mike
pompeo
the
director
of
the
central
intelligence
agency
cia
and
that
gina
haspel
would
take
over
from
pompeo
the
announcement
saw
the
dollar
index
which
measures
the
greenback
against
six
other
top
world
currencies
fall
to
a
low
and
meant
the
s
p
opened
more
subdued
than
traders
had
earlier
expected
what
we
are
seeing
here
is
that
those
people
in
the
administration
in
the
more
moderate
line
of
thinking
are
being
ousted
so
this
adds
to
the
concerns
the
more
radical
forces
are
gaining
some
ground

the

during
a
shakeout
in

in

the
selloff
came
on
the
back
of
strong
wage
numbers
which
investors
feared
might
feed
into
inflation

reversed

the

was
mainly
against
