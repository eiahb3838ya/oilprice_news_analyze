hail
the

in
settling
regional
conflicts

aimed

bolstering
australian
efforts

meeting
of
the
association

south
east
asian

will
argue
that
international
law
will
stabilise
a
region
strained
by
rival
claims
in
the
south
china
sea
the
order
is
designed
to
regulate
behaviour
and
rivalries
of
and
between
states
and
ensure
countries
compete
fairly
and
in
a
way
that
does
not
threaten
others
or
destabilise
their
region
or
the
world
bishop
will
say
in

it
places

unfair
agreements

australia
a
staunch
ally
with
no
claim
to
the
south
china
sea
has
long
maintained
its
neutrality
on
the
dispute
to
protect
economic
relationship
with
china
but
with
australia

relations
with
china
souring
in
recent
months
bishop
s
comment
underscore
a
new
australian
tactic
australia
is
trying
to
get
asean
on
side
with
the
notion
that
china
is
a
