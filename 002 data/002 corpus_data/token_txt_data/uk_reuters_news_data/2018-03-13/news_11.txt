cut
the
amount

that

allowed
from

is
a
significant
issue

bp
expects
only
about

likely
to
be
as

the

vice

of

at
the
moment
nobody
is
really
doing
anything
with
a
number
of
the
shippers
playing
chicken
with
the

does
the

blink
we
don
t
know
gelder
told
reuters
one
way
ships
can
comply
with
coming
standards
is
to
retrofit
vessels
with
costly
scrubbers
which
can
reduce
sulphur
emissions
even
if
ships
continue
to
burn
dirty
fuel
but
there
are
significant
concerns
with
this
process
as
well
industry
participants
said
the
cost
of
installing
scrubbers
is
about
million
to
million

vice
president
of

safety
at
fluor
right
now
less
than
ships
have
scrubbers
we
re
talking
more
like
and
it
could
take
more
than
a
decade
before
scrubbers
are
fitted
on
all
the
vessels
