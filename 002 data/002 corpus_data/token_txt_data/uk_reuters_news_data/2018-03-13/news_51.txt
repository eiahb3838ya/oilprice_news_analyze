prime

has
set
a

the

says
india
will
need

at

reach
its

jumped

in
mercom
said
but
predicted
additional
installations
will
fall
by
percent
to

this

the
lower

reflects
a

auction
activity
was
not
very
robust
in

though
there
was
a
surge
in
activity
at
the
end
of
the
year
most
of
the
projects
that
were
tendered
are
not
likely
to
be
commissioned
until
mercom
called
a
proposal
by
india
s
safety
watchdog
to
impose
a
percent
duty
on
imports
of
solar
equipment
from
china
and
some
other
countries
to
protect
domestic
manufacturers
as
an
unexpected
and
aggressive
recommendation
that
has
brought
the
industry
to
a
standstill
any
duty
would
hurt
big
project
developers
in
india
such
as
softbank
sb
energy
but
would
be
good
for
local
solar
component
makers
such
as
indosolar
and
moser
baer
which
have
struggled
to
compete
with
chinese
companies
such
as
trina
solar
and
yingli
reuters
also
reported
in
january
that
solar
modules
worth
more
than
million
were
stuck
at
various
indian
ports
due
to
a
dispute
over
their
classification
and
the
import
tax
applicable
to
them
most
of
the
modules
come
from
china
but
several
consignments
were
held
up
because
customs
officials
demanded
that
some
of
them
be
classified
as
electric
motors
and
generators
attracting
a
percent
duty
not
as
diodes
transistors
and
similar
devices
with

india
aims
for

to

of
and
the
ministry
of
new
and
renewable
energy
said
in
january
it
was
looking
to
address
issues
facing
solar
companies
the
imposition
of
any
additional
duties
would
make
solar
more
expensive
and
potentially
scare
away
financially
strapped
distribution
companies
who
are
looking
to
