shunning renewables, omv attracts investors with low-cost fossil fuels
reuters
while
other
european
energy
firms
are
flocking
to
renewables
austria
s
omv
is
sticking
with
fossil
fuels
and
telling
investors
it
will
deliver
rising
dividends
lower
costs
and
free
cash
flow
at
just
a
barrel
the
strategy
seems
to
be
working
omv
has
outperformed
peers
with
its
shares
up
about
percent
in
the
past
months
against
a
percent
drop
in
the
sector
over
two
years
the
gap
widens
with
omv
up
percent
and
the
sector
up
percent
presenting
its
new
targets
to
in
london
on
tuesday
chief
executive
rainer
seele
who
has
halved
production
costs
per
barrel
to
around
in
part
by
rapidly
expanding
in
russia
had
no
qualms
about
his
commitment
to
a
future
we
will
not
engage
in
renewables
it
s
not
part
of
our
strategy
i
can
not
do
everything
he
said
outlining
omv
s
spending
programme
to
seele
s
comments
come
as
other
european
energy
companies
such
as
shell
bp
plc
total
sa
and
statoil
are
becoming
increasingly
active
in
green
energy
seeking
to
position
themselves
for
the
future
shell
alone
has
spent
million
on
renewables
and
electric
car
charging
points
in
recent
months
analysts
at
bernstein
reckon
big
oil
has
invested
more
than
billion
on
renewables
acquisitions
over
the
past
five
years
mostly
solar
gas
the
least
polluting
fossil
fuel
is
widely
expected
to
be
crucial
for
reducing
emissions
omv
is
aiming
for
the
gas
part
of
its
portfolio
to
grow
to
up
to
percent
of
the
total
by
from
just
under
half
overall
output
is
expected
to
almost
double
between
and
to
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
seele
s
predecessor
had
bet
on
north
sea
production
where
other
producers
such
as
premier
are
looking
at
costs
of
up
to
per
barrel
but
seele
is
slashing
costs
by
selling
british
north
sea
assets
reducing
omv
s
norwegian
footprint
and
boosting
output
in
russia
the
middle
east
and
new
zealand
this
allows
omv
to
target
costs
at
around
per
barrel
through
requiring
the
oil
price
to
be
just
a
barrel
to
generate
free
cash
flow
compared
with
the
current
market
price
of
around
on
that
basis
omv
plans
to
keep
or
raise
its
dividend
it
proposed
its
highest
ever
payout
of
euros
a
share
for
by
comparison
bp
needs
a
price
of
at
least
per
barrel
to
break
even
this
year
and
statoil
around
omv
s
new
growth
strategy
is
encouraging
despite
some
bold
ambitions
for
profitable
growth
to
jefferies
which
reaffirmed
its
buy
rating
on
omv
shares
said
in
a
note
the
sustainable
organic
free
cash
flow
yield
of
around
percent
to
is
one
of
the
main
attractions
to
this
stock
it
said
pointing
to
peers
