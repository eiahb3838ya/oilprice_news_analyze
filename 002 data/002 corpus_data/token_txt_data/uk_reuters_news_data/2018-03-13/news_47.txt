this

crude

still

in

petromatrix

the

crude

from
major
shale
formations
is
expected
to
rise
by
bpd
in
april
from
the
previous
month
to
a
record
million
bpd
the
energy
information
administration
eia
said
in
a
monthly
report
on
monday
that
expected
increase
would
top
the
bpd
climb
in
march
from
the
previous
month
to
what
was
then
expected
to
be
a
record
high
of
million
bpd
the
eia
said
production
is
expected
to
rise
above
million

to
the

a
group

by
the

so

prevented

increase
in

is
bpd
this
would
see
shale
oil
production
soar
by
million
bpd
within
a
year
enough
to
cover
the
total
increase
in
global
oil
demand
commerzbank
said
in
a
note
thus
opec
has
no
scope
to
expand
production
from
its
current
but
in
a
sign
that
an
rally
in

oil
may
have
fizzled
