ulaanbaatar
reuters
mongolia
s
president
has
appealed
to
president
donald
trump
for
more
trade
between
their
countries
saying
an
economic
downturn
has
threatened
to
destabilise
the
young
asian
democracy
sandwiched
between
china
and
russia
mongolia
s
role
as
an
oasis
of
democracy
in
a
region
where
authoritarianism
in
on
the
rise
does
not
contribute
to
economic
development
mongolian
president
khaltmaa
battulga
said
in
a
letter
to
trump
dated
march
and
published
on
his
website
battulga
said
prosperity
was
coming
too
slowly
ordinary
mongolian
citizens
have
become
discouraged
by
democracy
and
have
begun
to
doubt
our
choice
he
said
mongolia
is
emerging
from
an
economic
crisis
after
agreeing
to
a
billion
billion
economic
bailout
from
the
international
monetary
fund
last
year
which
helped
stabilise
its
currency
and
relieve
debt
pressures
a
resurgence
in
the
coal
trade
in
the
region
also
helped
boost
growth
to
percent
last
year
compared
with
just
percent
in
but
mongolia
exported
just
million
worth
of
goods
to
the
united
states
last
year
according
to
mongolia
s
national
statistics
office
its
total
exports
stood
at
billion
with
the
bulk
going
south
to
china
trade
with
the
united
states
was
less
than
percent
of
its
total
last
year
and
a
decision
to
allow
imports
of
mongolian
clothing
would
help
ensure
economic
stability
battulga
said
he
also
called
for
easier
visa
conditions
for
mongolian
citizens
the
united
states
is
one
of
mongolia
s
third
neighbours
which
mongolia
uses
to
balance
relations
with
heavyweight
neighbours
china
and
russia
battulga
told
trump
that
trade
and
investment
could
help
prevent
mongolia
from
moving
in
a
more
authoritarian
direction
i
am
confident
that
supporting
mongolia
s
economic
security
will
play
a
prominent
role
in
your
country
s
foreign
policy
