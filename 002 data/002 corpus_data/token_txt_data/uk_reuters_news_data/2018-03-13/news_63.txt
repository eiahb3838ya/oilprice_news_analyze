india
s
oil
imports
from
venezuela
averaged
around
barrels
per
day
bpd
between
november
and
february
a
drop
of
about
percent
from
the
same
period
a
year
earlier
and
the
lowest
such
level
since
according
to
data
from

sources

the

venezuela
s
oil
production
plunged
to
the
lowest
in
decades
last
year
with
the
country
racked
by
inflation
a
lack
of
hard
currency
and
a
crippling
recession
the
average
of
venezuelan
crude
oil
to
india
is
around
bpd
the
shipping
and
industry
data
showed
india
s
oil
supplies
continue
to
be
dominated
by
middle
east
members
from
the
organization
of
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
with
iraq
and
saudi
arabia
prominent
key
for
venezuela
s
in
shipments
to
india
are
supply
obligations
to
other
countries
which
amid
its
overall
declining
output
leave
fewer
cargoes
available
for
sale
elsewhere
venezuela
is
obliged
to
supply
barrels
to
china
and
russia
to
pay
back
debts
so
not
too
much
is
left
for
others
mainly
india

the
sharp
venezuelan
declines
to
india
mark
a
of
a
previous
trend
venezuelan
oil
shipments
to
india
surged
from
may
when
supplies
from
iran
hit
insurance
and
banking
hurdles
caused
by
western
sanctions
against
tehran
s
nuclear
programme
however
new
delhi
boosted
purchases
from
tehran
after
the
lifting
of
sanctions
in
while
a
destructive
cocktail
of
insufficient
investments
payment
delays
to
suppliers
potential
sanctions
and
a
brain
drain
have
hammered
venezuela
s
oil
industry
why
should
india
buy
oil
from
a
country
which
is
too
far
away
plenty
of
oil
is
easily
available
from
nearby
nations
like
iraq
and
iran
