update 4-u.s. biofuels sector blasts epa settlement with bankrupt philadelphia refinery
philadelphia
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
s
decision
to
grant
a
bankrupt
philadelphia
refiner
relief
from
biofuel
laws
drew
criticism
on
tuesday
from
the
country
s
biofuels
sector
and
its
allies
who
said
it
sets
a
bad
precedent
the
epa
and
the
carlyle
philadelphia
energy
solutions
refinery
agreed
on
monday
that
the
refiner
will
have
to
satisfy
only
roughly
half
of
its
million
in
outstanding
compliance
obligations
under
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
the
rfs
requires
refiners
to
blend
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
into
their
fuel
or
buy
credits
known
as
rins
from
those
that
do
independent
refiners
including
some
as
large
as
valero
energy
corp
have
long
complained
about
the
rfs
standards
saying
it
has
boosted
costs
as
the
price
of
credits
rose
from
just
a
few
cents
in
to
more
than
at
times
in
and
however
biofuels
companies
say
the
standards
are
critical
to
midwest
farmers
and
help
produce
cleaner
fuels
like
ethanol
industry
representatives
complained
about
the
epa
settlement
calling
it
a
bailout
for
a
mismanaged
company
i
am
very
troubled
at
the
precedent
this
sets
and
there
are
discussions
underway
whether
the
epa
has
the
legal
standing
to
grant
the
relief
we
are
exploring
our
options
said
michael
mcadams
head
of
the
advanced
biofuels
association
president
donald
trump
has
called
several
white
house
meetings
to
change
the
program
the
epa
has
signaled
it
is
willing
to
exempt
more
small
refineries
which
would
limit
potential
buyers
for
the
credits
republican
senator
chuck
grassley
of
iowa
said
the
settlement
raises
a
couple
questions
how
are
the
rin
obligations
being
treated
compared
to
the
other
obligations
of
pes
does
this
set
an
unfair
precedent
for
other
refiners
that
continue
to
act
in
good
faith
to
comply
with
the
law
pes
was
given
relief
on
about
half
of
its
outstanding
obligations
the
company
which
lacks
blending
facilities
entered
into
bankruptcy
owing
million
credits
from
and
with
only
million
credits
in
hand
the
filing
showed
the
settlement
puts
pes
on
stable
path
to
success
and
protects
jobs
cherice
corley
a
company
spokeswoman
said
in
an
email
tuesday
but
more
needs
to
be
done
corley
said
this
is
only
a
partial
and
temporary
reprieve
and
we
are
hopeful
that
policymakers
will
substantively
address
the
flawed
rins
compliance
mechanism
so
that
a
restructured
pes
and
other
independent
merchant
refiners
can
finally
compete
on
a
level
playing
field
corely
said
pes
got
a
huge
win
it
does
not
have
to
go
into
the
market
and
buy
some
million
in
compliance
credits
covering
and
part
of
the
refiner
can
turn
over
its
available
credits
to
the
epa
and
is
excused
from
any
shortfall
there
s
no
denying
it
the
epa
settled
in
a
way
that
was
beneficial
to
the
bankruptcy
and
this
particular
firm
it
sends
a
bad
signal
about
what
the
epa
will
accept
in
the
future
said
scott
irwin
agricultural
economist
at
the
university
of
illinois
pes
blamed
its
financial
woes
on
the
cost
of
buying
the
but
other
factors
contributed
to
the
bankruptcy
including
withdrawal
of
more
than
million
in
payments
from
the
company
by
its
investor
owners
private
equity
firm
carlyle
rescued
the
refinery
from
shutting
in
putting
up
million
for
majority
control
most
dividends
paid
to
the
investor
group
were
backed
by
loans
taken
against
refinery
assets
monday
s
settlement
alleviates
fears
that
the
refinery
was
going
to
be
exempt
from
the
program
moving
forward
or
be
allowed
to
dump
millions
of
credits
onto
the
market
traders
said
the
epa
will
now
require
pes
to
buy
credits
rather
than
annually
that
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
refinery
the
largest
on
the
east
coast
to
build
a
large
short
position
or
defer
its
obligations
and
risk
getting
into
a
hole
as
it
did
in
prices
for
renewable
fuel
credits
for
were
at
cents
on
tuesday
little
changed
from
a
day
earlier
having
already
lost
percent
in
the
last
two
weeks
prices
for
are
selling
at
an
unusual
discount
versus
the
prices
in
the
wake
of
the
pes
settlement
