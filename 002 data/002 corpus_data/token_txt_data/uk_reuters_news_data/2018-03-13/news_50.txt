update 2-nigeria to cut sulphur in fuels a year after un deadline
london
reuters
nigeria
will
begin
cutting
the
sulfur
levels
allowed
in
imported
fuels
in
july
a
change
long
sought
by
health
and
environmental
campaigners
a
year
after
an
initial
deadline
an
official
at
state
oil
company
nnpc
said
west
african
nations
had
promised
higher
quality
by
july
as
part
of
a
united
nations
environmental
programme
unep
campaign
but
only
ghana
met
the
deadline
nigeria
imports
roughly
tonnes
of
gasoline
every
month
accounting
for
percent
of
west
african
imports
of
the
fuel
meaning
its
choices
on
fuel
quality
are
likely
to
impact
the
entire
region
nigeria
will
lower
the
top
level
of
sulfur
in
diesel
to
parts
per
million
ppm
from
ppm
by
july
anibor
kragha
nnpc
s
chief
operating
officer
of
refineries
and
petrochemicals
said
in
a
presentation
to
the
african
refiners
association
ara
gasoline
sulfur
level
cuts
a
cost
that
will
be
borne
largely
by
the
government
due
to
capped
prices
for
the
fuel
will
start
in
october
moving
to
ppm
from
ppm
nigeria
is
targeting
a
cut
to
ppm
by
october
kragha
said
the
standards
organization
of
nigeria
son
the
body
responsible
for
setting
requirements
for
imported
goods
published
tighter
quality
rules
last
year
but
another
government
body
the
department
of
petroleum
resources
dpr
did
not
issue
revised
specifications
james
mccullagh
analyst
with
energy
aspects
said
that
meant
nnpc
currently
has
the
right
rather
than
the
obligation
to
actually
import
it
cleaner
fuels
this
latest
move
would
merely
crystallize
that
obligation
he
said
kragha
told
journalists
in
cape
town
that
the
ministries
of
environment
health
petroleum
resources
and
industry
and
trade
were
working
together
to
finalize
rules
that
would
be
distributed
to
importers
at
some
point
in
the
second
quarter
unep
the
ara
and
health
campaigners
have
been
pushing
west
african
nations
to
ban
fuels
that
have
been
illegal
in
europe
and
the
united
states
for
years
due
to
what
they
say
are
significant
health
problems
associated
with
sulfur
emissions
particularly
in
dense
urban
areas
such
as
lagos
the
region
is
one
of
the
last
on
earth
where
it
is
legal
to
sell
fuels
with
sulfur
levels
at
and
above
ppm
as
east
and
north
african
nations
and
major
asian
consumer
countries
such
as
china
and
india
have
already
tightened
rules
kragha
in
a
presentation
during
ara
week
in
cape
town
said
that
while
nigeria
was
committed
to
cleaner
fuel
standards
significant
costs
complicated
efforts
to
meet
the
deadline
the
presentation
said
that
the
first
shift
to
cleaner
gasoline
would
cost
million
per
month
and
the
second
million
per
month
the
diesel
reduction
would
cost
million
per
month
because
gasoline
prices
are
capped
in
nigeria
and
nnpc
itself
has
been
importing
the
bulk
of
it
over
the
past
year
via
crude
for
product
swaps
the
government
is
likely
to
bear
much
of
the
initial
costs
for
a
cleaner
specification
diesel
prices
are
deregulated
meaning
consumers
will
pay
directly
for
the
fuels
nigeria
s
own
oil
refineries
will
have
until
to
meet
the
new
sulfur
levels
