anglo
american
on

announced
new
goals
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
percent
improve
energy
efficiency
by
percent
and
cut
freshwater

by
percent
in
arid

all
by

included
an
energy
savings
target
of
percent
and
a
goal
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
percent
while
cutting
freshwater
withdrawal
by
percent
the
way
the
targets
are
calculated
also
changes
as
the
previous
energy
and
greenhouse
gas
goals
were
calculated
versus
business
as
usual
while
the
goals
seek
an
improvement
in
energy
efficiency
per
tonne
of
copper
equivalent
mined
and
an
absolute
cut
in
greenhouse
gas
emissions
anglo
refers
to
the
new
targets
as
stretch
goals
because
of
the
challenge
of
meeting
them
and
says
they
should
give
it
a
strategic
advantage
by
cutting
costs
and
making
it
easier
to
secure
operating
licences
as
environmental
concerns
mount
the
financial
benefits
to
our
business
by
are
expected
to
be
significant
including
from
substantially
reduced
energy
and
water
costs
ceo
mark
cutifani
said
as
he
announced
the
goals
to
investors
in
london
if
you
don
t
have
the
trust
over
all
our
communities
you
just
won
t
get
the
access
to
the
ground
he
added
all
the
major
miners
have
released
a
series
of
sustainability
reports
and
goals
but
the
industry
is
still
associated
with
consumption
of
coal
the
most
polluting
fossil
fuel
and
environmental
damage
anglo
on
monday
had
to
halt
iron
ore
production
in
brazil
because
of
a
leak
and
cutifani
said
the
cause
was
being
investigated
cutifani
said
the
miner
had
reduced
its
thermal
coal
business
by
more
than
percent
over
five
years
but
added
governments
and
communities
still
depended
on
the
fuel
how
we
transition
has
to
be
done
in
a
responsible
way
