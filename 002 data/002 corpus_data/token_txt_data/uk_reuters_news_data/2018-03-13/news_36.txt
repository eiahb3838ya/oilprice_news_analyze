two
and
a
half
years
ago
europe
s
largest
automaker
had
been
slow
to
embrace
electric
cars
but
the
fraud
prompted
a
strategic
shift
while
advances
in
batteries
and
a
global
fight
against
pollution
are
raising
pressure
on
carmakers
to
adopt
alternatives

at
a

ev
programme
vw
s
emissions
scandal
new
chinese
quotas
for
electric
cars
and
tightening
rules
on
carbon

emissions
in
europe
are
causing
automakers
to
focus
on
green
cars
and
technology

has
a
goal
to
sell
million
electric
cars
per

across
the

amperex
technology
co
ltd
catl
will
deliver
batteries
to
vw
which
has
no
plans
to
start
producing
powerpacks
by
itself
mueller
said
building
up
expertise
and
mastering
the
technology
does
not
necessarily
imply
that
we
want
to
start
assembly
of
batteries
ourselves
the
ceo
said
others
can
do
it
better
than
we
although
grappling
with
billions
of

and
fines

separately
the
german
carmaker
reiterated
guidance
for
higher
vehicle
sales
and
revenue
this
year
and
for
a
group
operating
margin
of
percent
after
percent
last
year
in
an
interview
with
reuters
tv
mueller
denied
top
management
had
a
pessimistic
view
on
vw
s
business
prospects
in
but
said
potential
bottlenecks
as
carmakers
rush
to
get
models
through
new
wltp
lab
tests
for
emissions
and
fuel
consumption
were
causing
uncertainty
we
have
to
deal
with
wltp
this
year
he
said
it
s
simply
too
early
to
speculate
whether
this
will
be
an
especially
good
year
or
a
normal
