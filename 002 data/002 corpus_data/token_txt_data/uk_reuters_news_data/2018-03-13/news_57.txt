the

to
curb
investor
criticism
over
big
bonuses
paid
to
executives
despite
the
dieselgate

scandal
mueller
whose
contract
expires
in
earned
almost
a
fifth
more
than
the
million
euros
that
daimler
ceo
dieter
zetsche
made
for
a
year
in
which
daimler
s
brand
beat
rivals
audi
and
bmw
in
global
luxury
car
sales
for
a
second
year
volkswagen
group
nearly
doubled

in
mueller
had
earned
million
euros
under
vw
s
then
remuneration
system
which
allowed
bonuses
to
be
based
partly
on
vw
s
performance
over
the
previous
two
years
under
the
new
rules
the
carmaker
s
supervisory
board
capped
total
pay

its
ceo
at
million

compensation
of

top
executive
board
jumped

year
from
million
a
year
earlier
vw
said
sources
at
vw
said
that
mueller
s
package
exceeded
the
million
limit
because
of
perks
and
retirement
provisions
that
are
usually
included
under
hgb
rules
without
those
the
ceo
would
have
earned
about
million
euros
mueller
declined
to
comment
at
vw
s
results
news
conference
on
whether
it
was
unfortunate
that
the
million
euro
cap
had
been
hit
so
soon
after
its
creation
finance
chief
frank
witter
said
the
increase
in
mueller
s
remuneration
chimes
with
calls
from
investors
who
have
said
that
top
managers
are
right
to
benefit
from
the
group
s
success
in
profitable
times
for
that
reason
we
feel
vindicated
and
also
to
be
fully
in
compliance
with
the
