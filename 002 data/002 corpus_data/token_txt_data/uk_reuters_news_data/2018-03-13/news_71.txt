negative
territory
the

had
surged
percent
on

following
firm

on

while
low

eased
concerns
about

but
a
mixed
performance
by
shares
overnight
tempered
the
rally
the

p
and

slipped
on
monday
as
the
tariffs
signed

concerns

which
in

weighing

the

said
junichi

at

in

that
said
there
are
still
bright

put
japanese

under
fresh
pressure
although
such

have
lent
