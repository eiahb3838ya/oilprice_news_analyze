economy
standards
which
is
the
need
for
one

and
the
need
to
comprehend
new
technology
developments
like
increased
shared
and
autonomous
electric
vehicles
morrissey

automakers
are
pressing
the

board
chair
mary
nichols
said
in
january
the
board
does
not
believe
the
standards
should
be
lowered
but
is
willing
to
discuss
modifications
if
warranted
absent
any
such
evidence
we
will
certainly
resist
any
changes
nichols
said
car
companies
hope
to
avoid
a
potential
legal
battle
between
federal
regulators
many
state
attorneys
general
and
environmental
groups
that
could
leave
them
in
limbo
about
future
rules
the
manufacturers
also
want
rule
changes
to
address
lower
gasoline
prices
and
a
shift
in
consumer
preferences
to
larger
less
vehicles
industry
executives
have
not
publicly
asked
for
specific
reductions
in
the
requirements
negotiated
with
the
obama
administration
in
that
aimed
to
double
average
fuel
efficiency
to
about
miles
km
per
gallon
by
the
obama
administration
said
the
rules
would
save
motorists
trillion
in
fuel
costs
over
the
life
of
the
vehicles
but
cost
the
auto
industry
about
billion
over
years
auto
officials
say
the
trump
administration
is
considering
proposing
a
significant
reduction
in
the
requirements
any
changed
regulation
will
not
be
finalized
until
next
year
california
s
emissions
rules
are
followed
by
a
dozen
states
including
new
york
and
pennsylvania
and
the
district
of
columbia
that
account
for
about

of
vehicle
sales
other

also
have
been
holding
meetings
with

is
planned
this
week
between

motor
co
s
top
environment
and
safety
officer
officials
said
the
epa
is
expected
to
announce
by
april
the
existing
requirements
are
not
appropriate
but
it
is
unclear
precisely
when
epa
and
the
transportation
department
will
unveil
proposed
reductions
in
the
requirements
two
administration
officials
and
several
automakers
told
reuters
the
timing
of
proposing
reductions
in
the
requirements
or
new
flexibilities
for
automakers
remained
in
flux
epa
officials
suggested
a
proposal
could
come
in
late
may
or
june
while
the
transportation
department
is
pushing
for
a
speedier
unveiling
of
a

automakers
say
in

new
york
state
s
attorney
general
eric
schneiderman
and

top
state
law
enforcement
officials
said
they
would
mount
a
court
challenge
to
any
effort
to
roll
back
vehicle
emission
rules
the
obama
administration
sought
to
lock
in
the
rules
by
announcing
in
january
the
completion
of
a
midterm
review
to
determine
the
feasibility
of
the
model
year
rules
ahead
of
an
april
deadline
in

trump
announced
he
would
reopen
that
review
and
suggested
he
would
soften
the
mandates
the
assault
on
the
american
auto
industry
is
over
