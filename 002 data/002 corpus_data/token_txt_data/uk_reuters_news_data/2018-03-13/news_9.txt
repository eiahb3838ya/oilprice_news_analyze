filed
a
report
required
under
a
global
climate

the

obligates
the

world
needs
jean

s
attorney
told
the
thomson
reuters

by

adding
that
the
submitted
its
last
biannual
report
on
the
lawsuit
filed
in
federal
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
said
the
department
of
state
had
violated
transparency
and
administrative
laws
due
to
its
failure
to
respond
to
the
center
s
request
for
records
the
department
of
state
said
through
a
spokeswoman
that
it
does
not
comment
on
matters
under
litigation
it
is
the
latest
legal
action
taken
by
green
advocates
to
combat
efforts
by
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
to
minimize
its
role
in
combating
climate
change
and
roll
back
environmental
regulations
the
suit
follows
a
request
by
cbd
in
february
for
information
under
a
transparency
law
about
the
report
trump
last
year
announced
his
plan
to
pull
out
of
the
landmark
deal
to
fight
global
warming
which
was
reached
in
paris
in
by
nearly
nations
but
the
withdrawal
process
is
expected
to
take
at
least
three
years
meaning
the
country
remains
party
to
the
deal
in
its
complaint
the
cbd
said
the
united
states
had
violated
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
by
failing
to
take
the
required
steps
to
share
information
on
the
report
s
status
the
lawsuit
asked
the
court
to
order
the
department
of
state
to
conduct
searches
reasonably
calculated
to
locate
all
records
related
to
the
information
request
by
the
cbd
which
claims
million
members
and
supporters
trump
has
previously
said
he
thinks
climate
change
is
a
hoax
scientific
consensus
however
holds
that
climate
change
is
largely
manmade
with
such
devastating
effects
as
extreme
weather
rising
sea
levels
and
more
frequent
powerful
storms
