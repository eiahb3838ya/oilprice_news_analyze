republicans struggle to salvage congressional seat in pennsylvania
canonsburg
march
reuters
republicans
are
scrambling
to
avoid
a
political
disaster
in
a
conservative
district
of
pennsylvania
where
a
democrat
who
opposes
abortion
could
be
about
to
win
a
congressional
election
in
one
of
president
donald
trump
s
white
strongholds
democrat
conor
lamb
a
marine
veteran
and
former
federal
prosecutor
is
in
a
dead
heat
with
republican
state
representative
rick
saccone
in
tuesday
s
special
election
for
an
open
seat
in
the
house
of
representatives
that
republicans
have
held
since
the
race
is
seen
as
a
referendum
on
trump
and
a
harbinger
for
november
s
congressional
midterm
elections
according
to
pollsters
and
party
insiders
who
say
the
moderate
democrat
could
emerge
as
a
model
for
democratic
candidates
in
other
competitive
house
districts
that
trump
carried
in
the
democrats
have
nominated
the
ideal
candidate
because
he
fits
the
profile
of
the
electorate
if
they
d
nominated
a
liberal
who
allowed
the
campaign
to
become
nationalized
it
would
be
over
by
now
said
terry
madonna
director
of
the
franklin
and
marshall
college
poll
in
lancaster
pennsylvania
if
he
wins
or
even
if
he
just
comes
close
he
is
a
model
for
democrats
in
competitive
trump
districts
trump
won
the
district
in
southwest
pennsylvania
by
nearly
points
in
republican
dominance
has
been
so
strong
here
that
democrats
ran
no
candidates
in
the
last
two
house
elections
even
though
state
voter
registration
records
show
democrats
outnumbering
republicans
but
the
dynamics
have
changed
in
the
district
which
runs
from
wealthy
suburbs
south
of
pittsburgh
through
hardscrabble
steel
and
coal
mining
towns
to
farmlands
along
the
west
virginia
border
saccone
a
conservative
who
has
described
himself
as
trump
before
trump
was
trump
led
the
race
by
more
than
percentage
points
in
january
the
contest
has
since
narrowed
to
a
on
a
wave
of
democratic
voter
enthusiasm
for
lamb
a
monmouth
university
poll
on
monday
showed
lamb
ahead
bob
zelleznick
of
bethel
park
said
he
intends
to
vote
for
lamb
and
hopes
for
a
democratic
win
that
would
make
the
white
house
sit
up
and
take
notice
this
is
important
because
i
think
it
will
send
a
message
to
washington
a
lot
of
people
are
unhappy
with
the
administration
zelleznick
said
the
white
house
has
arranged
a
string
of
visits
to
energize
saccone
s
base
trump
himself
has
visited
twice
the
area
has
also
seen
vice
president
mike
pence
trump
adviser
kellyanne
conway
and
on
the
eve
of
election
day
the
president
s
son
donald
trump
when
president
trump
s
in
your
corner
how
can
you
lose
saccone
told
supporters
at
a
weekend
rally
with
the
president
a
college
professor
and
former
air
force
counterintelligence
officer
saccone
won
an
endorsement
from
the
influential
pittsburgh
newspaper
which
praised
his
greater
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
district
he
supports
small
business
owners
and
would
do
anything
for
you
to
make
sure
that
your
business
is
successful
said
stephanie
squibb
of
elizabeth
who
owns
a
local
printing
company
but
saccone
has
not
had
much
luck
running
on
the
republican
national
agenda
tax
cuts
the
republican
party
s
only
major
achievement
under
trump
have
done
little
to
energize
local
voters
some
of
whom
dismiss
the
sweeping
tax
overhaul
as
a
giveaway
to
the
wealthy
republicans
see
the
president
s
plans
to
impose
steel
and
aluminum
import
tariffs
as
a
way
to
generate
enough
enthusiasm
among
trump
s
supporters
to
counteract
the
energy
of
lamb
s
backers
they
re
hoping
this
is
something
that
potentially
in
the
grand
calculus
could
throw
saccone
over
the
top
said
republican
strategist
ford
o
connell
while
the
district
has
just
over
registered
voters
labor
department
statistics
show
that
metal
production
accounts
for
less
than
jobs
lamb
who
has
the
backing
of
unionized
steelworkers
says
he
agrees
with
the
planned
tariffs
his
campaign
claims
to
have
reached
more
than
households
with
pledges
to
protect
union
jobs
and
pensions
along
with
medicare
and
social
security
programs
for
the
elderly
that
account
for
nearly
one
out
of
every
five
local
residents
republicans
have
also
found
it
harder
than
expected
to
mount
effective
attacks
on
lamb
s
positions
on
abortion
guns
and
the
national
democratic
party
he
has
eschewed
the
national
democratic
brand
saying
he
would
not
support
house
democratic
leader
nancy
pelosi
as
speaker
but
lamb
did
get
help
from
former
vice
president
joe
biden
a
favorite
among
rust
belt
democrats
lamb
says
he
personally
opposes
abortion
but
accepts
the
supreme
court
s
roe
wade
landmark
decision
allowing
abortion
as
the
law
of
the
land
he
favors
enforcing
existing
gun
laws
and
improving
the
current
system
of
background
checks
over
setting
new
gun
restrictions
the
contest
to
replace
republican
tim
murphy
who
resigned
last
year
is
the
fifth
competitive
special
house
election
since
trump
took
office
after
a
victory
in
virginia
and
a
senate
upset
in
conservative
alabama
democrats
are
dreaming
about
another
win
that
would
suggest
the
republicans
might
struggle
to
retain
control
of
the
house
democrats
need
to
pick
up
seats
to
gain
house
control
in
november
of
the
races
currently
viewed
as
competitive
are
in
congressional
districts
that
trump
won
in
according
to
the
university
of
virginia
center
for
politics
tuesday
s
election
has
little
bearing
on
the
current
balance
of
power
in
the
house
lamb
has
dramatically
outraised
saccone
by
pulling
in
million
since
last
october
outside
republican
groups
led
by
the
national
republican
congressional
committee
and
congressional
leadership
fund
have
spent
at
least
million
to
keep
saccone
afloat
according
to
the
center
for
responsive
politics
which
tracks
money
in
campaigns
democratic
groups
have
spent
about
million
to
oppose
saccone
in
support
of
lamb
the
center
said
pennsylvania
s
congressional
district
lines
have
been
redrawn
for
november
by
the
state
supreme
court
which
will
require
lamb
and
saccone
to
run
again
in
separate
new
districts
if
they
hope
to
serve
in
congress
