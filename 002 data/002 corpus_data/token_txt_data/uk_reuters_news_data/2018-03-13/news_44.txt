in

advantage
of
divisions
within
the

macri
is
on

his

s
return
to

in
he
s
expected
to
stand
for
starting
in
late
the
decision
to
hold
offshore
auctions
comes
as
argentina
struggles
to
attract
investment
to
its
vaca
muerta
shale
play
which
is
in
a
remote
part
of
argentina
that
lacks
infrastructure
to
get
oil
and
gas
to
consumers
argentina
is
home
to
the
world
s
no
resources
of
shale
gas
and
the

largest
of

estimates
the

information
agency
yet

production
peaked
in
and

output
topped
out
in
according
to
energy
ministry
data
investment
in
exploration
has
dried
up
since
the
country
s
financial
crisis
and
the
populist
political
response
under
the
terms
of
a
revision
to
argentina
s
hydrocarbons
law
which
was
by
industry
royalties
paid
to
the
national
government
will
be
percent
of
the
value
of
hydrocarbons
extracted
and
companies
would
receive
exploration
rights
for
three
years
with
an
option
to
extend
for
three
years
rights
for
each
exploration
block
would
be
awarded
to
the
company
that
pledges
the
most
investment
as
laid
out
in
the
law
garcia
said
companies
will
be
interested
in
studying
something
that
has
not
been
explored
said
daniel
gerold
of
g
g
energy
consultants
in
buenos
aires
who
said
the
regional
competition
was
unlikely
to
be
an
obstacle
for
argentina
i
do
not
think
the
big
players
will
have
used
up
all
their
exploration
capital
in
the
majors
would
likely
be
most
interested
in
the
large
argentina
basin
the
least
explored
of
the
three
on
offer
bain
s
garcia
said
by
contrast
the
austral
basin
just
off
the
coast
of
tierra
del
fuego
would
be
more
of
a
gas
play
to
serve
the
domestic
market
and
could
appeal
to
local
players
and
total
which
already
operates
in
the
area
he
said
the
malvinas
west
basin
could
be
most
appealing
to
independent
oil
firms
he
said
perth
searcher
seismic
began
analyzing
existing
data
on
argentina
s
offshore
formations
in
november
smelling
opportunity
in
an
economic
and
political
opening
and
launched
a
full
database
for
exploration
companies
in
early
february
this
should
have
been
done
a
long
time
ago
in
argentina
searcher
director
odd
larsen
said
but
the
politics
and
the
finances
unfortunately
held
argentina
back
