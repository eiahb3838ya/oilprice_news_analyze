booming
oil
exports
have
set
off
a
scramble
to
build
gulf
coast
ports
to
handle
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
in
new
supplies
expected
over
the
next
five
years
of
seven
proposed
projects
nowhere
is
the
opportunity
greater
or
the
competition
more
fierce
than
in
corpus
christi
texas
where
three
firms
are
vying
to
open
the
state
s
first
deepwater
port
commodities
trader
trafigura
has
taken
an
early
lead
with
a
planned
offshore
facility
that
has
an
easier
path
to
regulatory
approval
and
faces
fewer
objections
from
environmentalists
its
chief
competitor
a
partnership
of
investor
carlyle
group
and
the
port
of
corpus
christi
to
build
an
onshore
port
has
responded
by
petitioning
regulators
to
kill
trafigura
s
project
port
lobbyists
have
cited
past
criminal
allegations
involving
the
firm
in
other
countries
and
potentially
catastrophic
environmental
impacts
rising
demand
for
new
ports
follows
a
decision
by
the
congress
to
lift
a
ban
on
crude
exports
after
advances
in
drilling
techniques
sparked
a
rapid
rise
in
domestic
shale
production
especially
in
texas
the
united
states
had
been
the
world
s
top
oil
buyer
for
decades
and
its
port
infrastructure
was
built
to
import
rather
than
export
now
surging
exports
threaten
to
overwhelm
existing
ports
as
production
is
projected
to
hit
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
this
year
up
from
million
in
crude
producers
send
more
shale
oil
to
the
world
we
ve
got
a
wave
of
oil
headed
toward
the
coast
said
jeremiah
ashcroft
iii
chief
executive
of
lone
star
ports
llc
the
company
formed
to
develop
its
corpus
christi
project
only
one
facility
the
louisiana
offshore
oil
port
can
fully
load
supertankers
capable
of
carrying
million
barrels
the
corpus
christi
port
the
closest
to
the
most
prolific
shale
fields
in
texas
exports
less
than
million
bpd
and
its
harbor
is
too
shallow
to
fully
load
supertankers
the
market
ultimately
may
support
more
than
one
new
deepwater
port
but
the
first
firm
to
build
near
corpus
christi
will
have
the
best
shot
at
cutting
deals
with
producers
expected
to
ship
an
estimated
million
bpd
to
the
region
through
new
pipelines
set
to
open
this
year
right
now
there
s
only
enough
room
for
one
project
ashcroft
said
carlyle
plans
a
billion
port
to
handle
million
bpd
trafigura
which
has
not
disclosed
its
planned
investment
in
the
port
would
handle
much
less
at
bpd
but
trafigura
s
operation
would
siphon
off
revenue
from
the
port
of
corpus
christi
and
carlyle
s
project
because
trafigura
would
serve
shippers
offshore
before
they
reach
the
harbor
carlyle
declined
to
make
an
executive
available
for
an
interview
and
referred
questions
to
lone
star
trafigura
said
in
a
statement
that
its
port
would
leave
room
for
other
projects
because
it
would
handle
only
a
portion
of
the
expected
new
oil
flows
a

lp
plans
an
export
terminal
on
the
corpus
christi
harbor
near
carlyle
s
proposed
site
but
magellan
faces
a
roadblock
because
port
officials
last
year
agreed
to
work
exclusively
with
carlyle
magellan
said
in
a
statement
that
it
has
not
decided
whether
to
build
the
project
companies
including
kinder
morgan
inc
jupitermlp
and
tallgrass
energy
have
also
proposed
offshore
ports
along
the
gulf
coast
carlyle
said
last
october
that
it
could
open
its
facility
by
late
but
that
assumes
its
plan
for
dredging
to
accommodate
supertankers
will
not
require
a
full
environmental
review
which
is
sought
by
opponents
and
could
take
two
years
as
carlyle
and
the
port
have
tried
to
navigate
those
obstacles
port
lobbyists
have
petitioned
regulators
to
halt
trafigura
s
project
in
an
august
letter
the
port
s
law
firm
called
on
the
coast
guard
and
the
maritime
administration
to
reject
trafigura
s
application
citing
a
criminal
the
letter
from
baker
wotring
llp
pointed
to
the
trader
s
guilty
plea
for
selling
a
company
oil
from
iraq
that
trafigura
falsely
claimed
had
been
authorized
under
a
united
nations
humanitarian
aid
program
companies
at
the
time
were
barred
by
government
sanctions
from
buying
iraqi
oil
except
through
the
program
after
the
regulators
declined
the
port
s
request
its
law
firm
in
december
raised
bribery
allegations
brought
earlier
that
month
by
brazilian
prosecutors
against
two
former
trafigura
executives
the
firm
asked
regulators
to
halt
trafigura
s
work
until
the
allegations
were
fully
trafigura
said
in
a
statement
that
its
management
had
no
knowledge
of
any
improper
payments
made
to
employees
of
brazil
s
oil
firm
petrobras
trafigura
did
not
comment
on
the
port
law
firm
citing
its
guilty
plea
involving
iraq
oil
sales
last
month
five
corpus
christi
area
lawmakers
asked
texas
governor
greg
abbott
to
veto
trafigura
s
application
on
environmental
grounds
citing
a
risk
of
catastrophic
crude
oil
spills
and
excessive
air
federal
rules
require
state
governors
to
sign
off
on
offshore
ports
abbott
has
made
no
decision
a
spokesman
said
lone
star
s
ashcroft
said
onshore
terminals
are
safer
than
offshore
projects
because
oil
spills
are
more
easily
cleaned
up
in
harbors
than
in
open
water
trafigura
said
it
chose
to
go
offshore
to
ensure
supertankers
can
safely
and
efficiently
load
cargoes
and
that
its
application
will
be
reviewed
by
more
than
government
agencies
carlyle
is
essential
to
building
the
port
of

christi
s
crude
export
business
port
officials
started
pursuing
federal
approval
to
dredge
its
harbor
years
ago
but
congress
only
recently
approved
million
a
fraction
of
what
s
needed
we
don
t
have
years
we
have
two
said
sean
strawbridge
chief
executive
of
the
port
of
corpus
christi
authority
referring
to
its
timeline
for
readying
the
port
for
new
oil
flows
port
officials
last
year
sought
to
kickstart
the
dredging
by
issuing
million
in
bonds
that
money
will
allow
it
to
start
dredging
to
a
draft
not
deep
enough
for
supertankers
if
trafigura
s
port
wins
approval
it
could
take
business
from
the
port
of
corpus
christi
port
revenues
could
fall
by
about
percent
estimated
investment
researcher
morningstar
a
loss
that
could
hurt
its
efforts
to
finance
dredging
not
covered
by
the
government
or
carlyle
in
october
carlyle
agreed
to
pay
an
undisclosed
sum
to
cover
the
dredging
needed
to
get
achieve
a
draft
in
the
outer
harbor
to
accommodate
supertankers
environmentalists
favor
offshore
ports
over
what
they
consider
the
harmful
impact
of
dredging
harbors
the
newly
formed
port
aransas
conservancy
in
south
texas
has
argued
carlyle
s
plan
would
endanger
sea
turtle
nesting
areas
dump
silt
onto
nearby
islands
and
threaten
shellfish
that
reach
estuaries
through
the
ship
channel
trafigura
has
countered
environmental
concerns
about
its
offshore
operation
by
proposing
to
tunnel
under
sand
dunes
and
wetlands
to
install
a
pipeline
instead
of
digging
a
trench
through
environmentally
sensitive
areas
sea
turtles
are
always
an
issue
with
dredging
because
it
brings
in
salt
water
said
jayson
hudson
a
regulatory
supervisor
at
the
army
corp
of
engineers
which
oversees
permitting
for
carlyle
s
project
he
called
trafigura
s
horizontal
drilling
plan
a
good
option
for
avoiding
permanent
dredging
the
harbor
by
contrast
would
have
impacts
said
john
donovan
president
of
the
port
aransas
conservancy
we
re
very
much
against
what
we
consider
to
be
an
environmental
disaster
that
the
port
s
plans
for
harbor

would
entail
