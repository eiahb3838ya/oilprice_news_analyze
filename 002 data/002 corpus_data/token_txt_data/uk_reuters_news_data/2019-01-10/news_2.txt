sanctions
against
the
nord
stream
pipeline
would
be
the
wrong
way
to
solve
a
dispute
over
energy
supply
german
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
said
on
thursday
president
donald
trump
has
accused
germany
of
being
a
captive
of
russia
due
to
its
energy
reliance
and
urged
it
to
halt
work
on
the
billion
gas
pipeline
that
is
to
be
built
in
the
baltic
sea
questions
of
european
energy
policy
must
be
decided
in
europe
not
in
the
maas
said
to
impose
unilateral
sanctions
against
nord
stream
is
certainly
not
the
way
to
berlin
and
moscow
have
been
at
odds
since
russia
annexed
crimea
four
years
ago
but
they
have
a
common
interest
in
the
nord
stream
project
which
is
expected
to
double
the
capacity
of
the
existing
nord
stream
route
washington
is
concerned
the
pipeline
which
will
bypass
ukraine
by
running
under
the
baltic
sea
will
strip
ukraine
of
important
transit
revenues
joseph
spokesman
for
the
embassy
in
berlin
said
other
european
states
also
opposed
the
planned
pipeline
we
would
point
out
that
the
european
parliament
condemned
nord
stream
and
called
for
its
cancellation
as
recently
as
december
he
said
in
response
to
the
comments
by
maas
washington
has
touted
liquefied
natural
gas
delivered
by
companies
as
an
alternative
to
russian
gas
german
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
told
reuters
in
an
interview
last
month
that
germany
would
build
the
infrastructure
to
import
lng
and
that
authorities
were
currently
in
the
process
of
clarifying
