volkswagen
sold
a
record
million
of
its
vehicles
last
year
despite
delivery
problems
caused
by
new

but
warned
the

would
continue
to
face
considerable
challenges
in
still
battling
to
recover
from
a
emissions
test
cheating
scandal
and
facing
tighter
european
environmental
rules
the
german
automaker
has
been
trying
to
boost
sales
and
cut
costs
to
fund
an
ambitious
shift
to
electric
cars
and
automated
driving
at
the
same
time
trade
disputes
with
china
driven
by
president
donald
trump
s
america
first
policies
have
caused
uncertainty
in
the
global
auto
industry
will
once
again
be
a
year
of
enormous
challenges
for
the
brand
aside
from
volume
growth
we
will
focus
even
more
on
our
profitability
chief
operating
officer
ralf
brandstaetter
said
vw
brand
sales
rose
percent
last
year
thanks
to
growth
in
south
america
the
united
states
and
europe
compensating
for
a
decline
in
china
and
difficulties
registering
cars
following
the
introduction
of
worldwide
harmonised
light
vehicle
test
wtlp
emissions
standards
the
numbers
do
not
include
sales
under
the
audi
porsche
skoda
bentley
bugatti
lamborghini
and
seat
brands
which
are
also
owned
by
volkswagen
the
vw
brand
increased
market
share
in
china
in
but
its
vehicle
sales
fell
percent
with
the
world
s
largest
passenger
car
market
on
track
for
an
annual
sales
contraction
not
seen
since
at
least
for
the
wider
region
sales
dropped
percent
this
decline
is
mainly
due
to
developments
in
china
where
consumer
restraint
continues
in
an
uncertain
macroeconomic
environment
the
company
said
despite
rising
percent
for
the
year
european
sales
took
a
hit
after
stricter
rules
were
introduced
in
september
was
marked
by
significant
uncertainty
in
some
regions
especially
in
the
second
half
vw
brand
sales
chief
juergen
stackmann
said
in
a
statement
but
he
added
that
new
products
had
helped
offset
that
the
company
sold
around
electric
and
hybrid
cars
a
percent
increase
