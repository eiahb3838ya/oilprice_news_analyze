maduro faces next term in a hobbled, isolated venezuela
caracas
jan
reuters
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
begins
a
second
term
in
office
on
thursday
in
defiance
of
international
criticism
that
his
reelection
last
year
was
illegitimate
further
isolating
the
south
american
country
where
an
economic
crisis
is
fueling
a
humanitarian
emergency
leaders
from
the
ruling
socialist
party
have
disavowed
criticism
of
maduro
s
inauguration
which
will
keep
him
at
the
helm
of
the
opec
oil
exporter
until
calling
for
rallies
of
support
and
promoting
him
on
social
media
with
twitter
hashtags
such
as
iampresident
opposition
leaders
however
have
portrayed
thursday
s
inauguration
as
the
moment
at
which
maduro
will
be
internationally
branded
a
dictator
following
a
widely
boycotted
election
that
governments
around
the
world
described
as
a
farce
but
continued
support
from
the
military
a
chronically
fractured
opposition
and
a
relentless
crackdown
on
opposition
critics
means
that
maduro
appears
to
face
few
serious
challenges
at
home
despite
the
international
outcry
they
ve
tried
to
turn
a
constitutional
ceremony
into
a
world
war
maduro
said
during
a
press
conference
on
wednesday
afternoon
but
whether
there
s
rain
thunder
or
lightning
we
re
going
to
the
ceremony
is
scheduled
for
local
time
gmt
on
thursday
maduro
s
triumphalism
echoes
that
of
his
predecessor
late
socialist
leader
hugo
chavez
who
used
abundant
oil
revenues
to
flood
venezuela
with
consumer
goods
while
providing
heavily
subsidized
food
and
medicine
that
contrasts
sharply
with
the
venezuela
of
today
inflation
is
fast
approaching
million
percent
leaving
a
monthly
minimum
wage
worth
less
than
a
carton
of
eggs
some
three
million
people
have
emigrated
since
many
on
foot
to
escape
rising
malnutrition
and
disease
according
to
the
united
nations
bank
notes
that
once
paid
for
months
worth
of
groceries
are
now
tossed
in
trash
cans
piled
into
useless
stacks
or
even
woven
into
women
s
handbags
sold
by
street
merchants
maduro
last
year
won
reelection
despite
the
economic
chaos
in
large
part
because
the
opposition
boycotted
the
vote
in
which
socialist
party
activists
openly
made
payments
to
voters
within
a
stone
s
throw
of
polling
stations
countries
around
the
world
condemned
the
vote
including
the
united
states
and
venezuela
s
neighbors
in
latin
america
leaving
maduro
backed
by
just
a
handful
of
stalwart
allies
from
leftist
governments
while
few
countries
plan
to
shutter
embassies
or
sever
ties
with
the
maduro
government
according
to
diplomatic
sources
the
vast
majority
will
not
send
diplomats
to
the
inauguration
as
is
customary
the
government
feted
the
arrival
of
foreign
dignitaries
who
traveled
for
the
inauguration
including
the
president
of
south
ossetia
a
disputed
territory
in
the
caucasus
region
that
is
rarely
described
as
nation
that
sparked
guffaws
from
opposition
critics
who
called
it
a
signal
of
isolation
opposition
activists
have
called
for
protests
on
thursday
authorities
have
responded
by
filling
streets
with
police
checkpoints
and
troops
fury
in
over
maduro
s
aggressive
sidelining
of
the
congress
led
to
a
wave
of
protests
that
killed
over
but
failed
to
shake
him
from
power
and
left
his
adversaries
frustrated
they
re
trying
to
scare
us
so
that
we
don
t
protest
said
henry
ramirez
a
computer
engineer
in
the
western
city
of
san
cristobal
attempting
to
cut
into
a
line
for
gasoline
the
type
of
a
queue
that
has
become
increasingly
frequent
amid
the
crisis
tomorrow
the
dictatorship
while
politically
motivated
demonstrations
have
faded
protests
take
place
nearly
every
day
to
demand
salary
improvements
access
to
food
and
medicine
or
improvements
to
spotty
power
and
water
services
less
than
hours
before
maduro
s
swearing
in
troops
in
the
second
largest
city
of
maracaibo
fired
tear
gas
at
informal
vendors
who
were
defying
an
order
not
to
set
up
stalls
at
a
market
in
the
city
center
the
vendors
later
looted
nearby
shops
maduro
is
going
to
be
sworn
in
and
i
don
t
think
it
changes
anything
said
angela
perez
who
works
the
cash
register
at
a
restaurant
in
the
city
of
valencia
adding
she
does
not
sympathize
with
maduro
or
his
critics
i
m
just
trying
to
get
a
few
more
documents
together
so
i
can
leave
the
country
there
s
no
