washington

president
donald
trump
stormed
out
of
talks
with
democratic
congressional
leaders
on
wednesday
over
funding
for
a
border
wall
with
mexico
and
reopening
the
government
complaining
the
meeting
at
the
white
house
was
a
total
waste
of
on
the
day
of
a
partial
government
shutdown
caused
by
the
dispute
over
the
wall
a
short
meeting
that
included
trump
house
of
representatives
speaker
nancy
pelosi
and
senate
democratic
leader
chuck
schumer
ended
in
acrimony
with
no
sign
of
a
resolution
just
left
a
meeting
with
chuck
and
nancy
a
total
waste
of
time
trump
wrote
on
twitter
i
asked
what
is
going
to
happen
in
days
if
i
quickly
open
things
up
are
you
going
to
approve
border
security
which
includes
a
wall
or
steel
barrier
trump
wrote
nancy
said
no
i
said
nothing
else
works
exasperated
democrats
called
trump
s
behaviour
a
temper
tantrum
and
said
the
meeting
broke
down
when
they
refused
to
commit
to
funding
his
proposed
southern
border
wall
trump
s
desire
for
a
wall
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
was
a
central
theme
of
his
presidential
campaign
it
was
a
petulant
president
of
the
united
states
pelosi
told
reporters
when
she
returned
to
the
capitol
a
person
who
would
say
i
ll
keep
government
shut
down
for
weeks
months
or
years
unless
i
get
my
that
s
just
not
the
way
democracy
works
and
so
it
s
very
schumer
said
trump
had
a
temper
the
lawmaker
told
reporters
that
is
sad
and
unfortunate
we
want
to
come
to
an
agreement
we
believe
in
border
security
we
have
different
the
breakdown
in
talks
could
strengthen
the
possibility
that
trump
will
declare
a
national
emergency
to
build
a
wall
on
the
southern
border
if
no
deal
with
congress
can
be
reached
on
his
request
for
billion
billion
pounds
for
the
project
earlier
on
wednesday
trump
said
he
had
the
authority
to
declare
a
national
emergency
that
would
let
him
pay
for
the
wall
with
military
funds
vice
president
mike
pence
told
reporters
trump
was
still
considering
that
option
asked
what
trump
had
gained
by
walking
out
pence
said
i
think
the
president
made
his
position
very
clear
today
that
there
will
be
no
deal
without
a
shortly
after
the
white
house
meeting
broke
up
the
house
of
representatives
passed
legislation
to
end
a
partial
shutdown
of
the
treasury
department
and
some
other
agencies
that
have
been
closed
since
without
money
for
the
wall
but
there
was
no
indication
that
the
senate
controlled
by
trump
s
fellow
republicans
would
allow
a
vote
on
the
bill
democrats
are
eager
to
force
republicans
to
choose
between
funding
the
treasury
s
internal
revenue
service
at
a
time
when
it
should
be
gearing
up
to
issue
tax
refunds
to
millions
of
americans
and
voting
to
keep
it
partially
shuttered
in
a
countermove
the
trump
administration
said
that
even
without
a
new
shot
of
funding
the
irs
would
somehow
make
sure
those
refund
checks
get
sent
the
national
treasury
employees
union
filed
suit
on
wednesday
challenging
the
administration
s
authority
to
force
federal
employees
to
work
without
pay
trump
attended
a
lunch
meeting
of
senate
republicans
on
wednesday
and
emerged
to
declare
unwavering
support
for
the
tough
stance
he
has
taken
on
funds
for
the
wall
asked
if
he
got
the
impression
in
the
meeting
that
the
shutdown
would
end
soon
republican
senator
tim
scott
said
i
did
not
i
think
we
re
going
to
be
here
a
pelosi
plans
more
votes
this
week
that
one
by
one
would
provide
money
to
operate
departments
ranging
from
homeland
security
and
justice
to
state
agriculture
commerce
and
labour
able
to
get
the
bills
through
the
house
because
of
the
democratic
majority
pelosi
is
hoping
some
senate
republicans
back
her
up
and
abandon
trump
s
wall
gambit
the
political
manoeuvring
comes
amid
a
rising

resulted
in
the

of
hundreds
of
thousands
of

his
first
television
address
from
the
oval
office
on
tuesday
to
make
his
case
for
the
border
wall
the
funding
fight
stems
from
congress
inability
to
complete
work
by
a
deadline
last
september
on
funding
all
government
agencies
it
did
however
appropriate
money
for
about

programs
airport

workers
and
air
traffic
controllers

warned

security
and
safety
could
