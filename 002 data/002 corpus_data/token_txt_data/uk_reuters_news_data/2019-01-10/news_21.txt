austrian
utility
verbund
and
heavy

have
launched
proceedings
in
vienna
against
german
grid
operator
tennet
tso
in
a
bid
to
restore
the
power
price
zone
the
austrians
said
the
zone
s
split
in
october
which
has
capped
power
flows
between
the
two
countries
has
led
to
additional
charges
of
million
euros
million
a
year
for
austrian
customers
the
european
union
s
regulatory
authority
acer
decided
to
split
europe
s
largest
area
of
uniform
electricity
prices
to
curb
excessive
and
volatile
exports
of
germany
s
renewable
production
german
oversupply
arises
from
wind
parks
in
the
north
whose
power
flows
do
not
go
straight
to
the
southern
industrial
zones
because
planned
transport
grids
are
not
ready
instead
wind
power
is
rerouted
via
poland
the
czech
republic
and
austria
and
back
into
germany

flows
increasing
the
grid
s
volatility
and
security
risks
austria
had
benefited
from
these
flows
as
it
was
able
to
buy
surplus
german
power
at
low
prices
store
excess
power
in
its
plants
and
resell
it
at
higher
prices
when
supply
was
tight
but
after
polish
and
czech
complaints
about
the

acer
decided

filed
a
request
against
tennet
tso
at
vienna
s
higher
regional
court
to
stop
abuse
of
significant
market
power
they
said
on
thursday
the
german
grid
operator
exploits
its
dominant
market
position
by
curbing
the
amount
of
power
that
is
traded
between
germany
and
austria
the
companies
said
in
a
joint
statement
tennet
tso
has
been
capping
power
flows
at
gigawatts
gw
since
october
putting
into
practice
an
agreement
that
was
reached
between
the
german
and
the
austrian
network
regulators
to
implement
the
acer
decision
this
move
leads
to
an
market
distortion
as
the
structural
grid
bottlenecks
are
not
at
the
border
but
within
germany
the
austrian
statement
said
we
want
to
go
back
to
the
conditions
before
october
said

chief

anzengruber
tennet
said
it
did
not
see
any
reason
to
deviate
from
the
eu
decision
