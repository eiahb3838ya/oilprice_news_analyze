seen
as
vital
for
bringing
crude
out
of
the
largest
oilpatch
in
the

crude
prices
in
the
permian

have
come
under

in

as
an
open
season
to
solicit
shippers
that
commit
to
contracts
and
fill
the
line
with
crude
before
commercial
deliveries
begin
we
have
had
no
indication
from
commission
staff
that
any
aspect
of
our
project
is
problematic
from
a
regulatory
standpoint
but
we
are
committed
to
addressing
and
resolving
any
issues
that
should
arise
in
that
regard
