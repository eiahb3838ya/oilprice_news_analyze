caracas
reuters
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
started
a
second
term
on
thursday
defying
critics
in
the
united
states
and
latin
america
who
called
him
an
illegitimate
usurper
of
a
nation
where
economic
chaos
has
wrought
a
humanitarian
crisis
the
country
s
supreme
court
which
has
largely
supplanted
the
congress
swore
him
in
following
a
welcome
with
a
symphony
orchestra
and
cheering
supporters
waving
miniature
yellow
blue
and
red
venezuelan
flags
the
ceremony
contrasted
with
the
harsh
realities
that
face
the
former
bus
driver
turned
socialist
leader
including
hyperinflation
severe
food
and
medicine
shortages
and
an
exodus
of
millions
of
citizens
before
he
had
even
completed
his
inaugural
speech
the
united
states
decried
a
usurpation
of
power
and
paraguay
announced
it
was
cutting
diplomatic
ties
highlighting
the
growing
isolation
that
maduro
will
face
a
new
world
has
risen
up
that
refuses
to
be
controlled
by
the
imperial
and
hegemonic
orders
of
a
single
nation
or
its
satellite
countries
maduro
said
following
his
that
s
the
rallying
cry
of
our
revolution
to
the
peoples
and
governments
of
the
supreme
court
chief
maikel
moreno
dedicated
nearly
minutes
to
explaining
why
maduro
was
not
being
sworn
in
by
congress
which
the
ruling
socialist
party
has
systematically
ignored
since
the
opposition
took
control
of
the
body
in
opposition
leaders
have
portrayed
the
inauguration
as
the
moment
at
which
maduro
will
be
internationally
branded
a
dictator
following
a
widely
boycotted
election
that
many
foreign
governments
described
as
a
farce
we
call
on
the
armed
forces
the
majority
of
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
refuse
to
be
corrupted
to
step
forward
said
congress
chief
juan
guaido
at
a
news
conference
we
must
disavow
that
which
was
not
the
result
of
a
popular
but
maduro
continues
to
enjoy
consistent
support
from
the
armed
forces
leaving
him
with
few
serious
challenges
at
home
despite
the
international
outcry
that
support
was
on
display
on
thursday
afternoon
during
a
ceremony
at
venezuela
s
military
academy
in
caracas
flanked
by
the
military
s
top
commanders
maduro
strolled
through
a
courtyard
filled
with
thousands
of
uniformed
troops
loyalty
always
betrayal

said
defence
minister
vladimir
padrino
shortly
before
handing
maduro
a
replica
of
the
sword
of
venezuelan
liberation
hero
rafael
urdaneta
the
washington
post
on
wednesday
reported
that
padrino
had
told
maduro
to
step
down
last
month
and
said
he
would
offer
his
own
resignation
if
he
did
not
supporters
many
of
whom
were
public
servants
identified
by
of
state
agencies
rallied
in
the
centre
of
caracas
to
celebrate
the
new
term
some
said
maduro
should
do
more
to
crack
down
on
business
leaders
for
raising
prices
sometimes
it
s
hard
to
find
food
because
businesses
hide
it
and
then
say
it
s
the
president
s
fault
even
though
we
all
know
that
s
a
lie
said
graciela
laya
a
homemaker
at
a
rally
near
the
supreme
court
maduro
replaced
hugo
chavez
after
his
death
in
and
won
a
new
term
in
despite
hyperinflation
chronic
food
shortages
and
a
severe
economic
contraction
he
blames
an
economic
war
led
by
the
united
states
and
local
opposition
adversaries
for
the
country
s
woes
the
vast
majority
of
the
opposition
boycotted
last
year
s
vote
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
rigged
in
favour
of
maduro
noting
a
host
of
irregularities
including
socialist
party
activists
offering
monetary
payments
to
voters
the
united
states
the
european
union
and
many
latin
american
countries
condemned
the
vote
last
year
and
issued
withering
criticism
of
maduro
on
thursday
it
is
time
for
venezuela
to
begin
a
transitional
process
that
can
restore
the
constitutional
democratic
order
by
holding
free
and
fair
elections

the
will
