the
early
year
rally
in
world
stocks
ran
out
of
steam
in
europe
on
thursday
and
the
dollar
dropped
to
a
near
low
as
mixed
signals
from
trade
talks
and
caution
at
the
federal
reserve
applied
the
brakes
china
said
the
three
days
of
talks
in
beijing
had
established
a
foundation
to
resolve
the
two
country
s
differences
but
gave
virtually
nothing
in
the
way
of
details
on
key
issues
at
stake
a
slew
of
weak
data
also
dampened
the
mood
again
in
china
inflation
was
the
slowest
in
more
than
two
years
while
industrial
figures
in
france
provided
more
proof
that
europe
is
spluttering
again
the
stoxx
quickly
lost
percent
as
germany
s
dax
dropped
percent
and
britain
s
heavyweight
ftse
fell
percent
on
persistent

concerns
i
am
beginning
to
get
a
little
concerned
about
the
path
of
the
european
industrial
data
state
street
global
markets
head
of
strategy
michael
metcalfe
said
it
is
raising
the
possibility
of
a
technical
recession
in
europe
one
of
the
big
challenges
is
that
if
this
is
replicated
in
italy
s
data
tomorrow
that
potentially
brings
the
budget
questions
back
into
the
market
s
the
soured
sentiment
saw
the
normal
move
into
government
bonds
that
give
a
guaranteed
return
yields
on
german
and
french
and
government
bonds
which
move
inverse
to
price
dropped
towards
recent
lows
the
european
central
bank
will
publish
the
minutes
from
its
december
meeting
later
where
it
formal
shuttered
the
mass
bond

it
has
been

years
treasury
yields
last
stood
at
percent
down
from
percent
on
wednesday
when
fed
minutes
showed
policymakers
were
becoming
more
cautious
about
future
rate
hikes
the
dollar
remained
on
the
defensive
too
after
hitting
its
lowest
level
since
the
greenback
was
down
a
tenth
of
a
percent
against
the
euro
at
the
single
currency
gained
percent
against
the
dollar
during
the
previous
session
its
biggest
gain
since
late
june
china
s
yuan
also
muscled
higher
breaching
the
per
dollar
level
for
the
first
time
since
august
in
both
onshore
and
offshore
trade
in
asia
this
drop
in
the
dollar
is
an
overdue
correction
following
a
surprisingly
robust
few
weeks
despite
the
massive
collapse
in
rate
expectations
said
ulrich
leuchtmann
currency
strategist
at
commerzbank
asian
shares
had
edged
up
overnight
on
the
weaker
dollar
and
hopes
of
more
economic
stimulus
in
china
following
its
latest
data
disappointment
but
many
stocks
seesawed
and
tokyo
and
shanghai
both
closed
lower
as
markets
parsed
the
trade
talks
and
hoped
that
they
will
ultimately
avert
another
ramping
up
of
tariffs
in
march
oil
also
caught
investors
attention
as
brent
and
crude
fell
back
having
jumped
overnight
on
signs
of
crude
output
cuts
brent
crude
was
last
trading
percent
lower
at
a
barrel
and
wti
was
down
percent
at
cents
chris
weston
head
of
research
at
foreign
exchange
brokerage
pepperstone
said
he
viewed
more
gains
in
oil
prices
as
a
key
driver
for
any
further
rise
in
risk
appetite
if
crude
futures
can
break
through
the
level
you
re
going
to
see
real
yields
probably
lower
that
s
really
good
for
the
cost
of
money
and
taking
some
further
headwinds
out
of
the
dollar
