corp
from
using
power
lines
deemed
to
be
unsafe
during
high
winds
in
the
california

season
adding
another
complication
for
the
california
utility
as
it
faces
billions
of
dollars
in
wildfire
liabilities
in
an
order
district
judge
william
alsup
in
san

also
proposed
that
pg
e
be
required
to
reinspect
its
grid
and
remove
or
trim
all
trees
that
could
fall
onto
its
power

is
overseeing

for
pg
e
is
exploring
filing
some
or
all
of
its
business
for
bankruptcy
protection
as
a
contingency
in

from
fatal
wildfires

alsup
said
the
goal

was
to
eliminate
the
number
of

caused
by

in
this
will
likely
mean
having
to
interrupt
service
during
events
and
possibly
at
other
times
alsup
wrote
but
that
inconvenience
irritating
as
it
will
be
will
pale
by
comparison
to
the
death
and
destruction
that
otherwise
might
result
from
pg
pg
e
said
in
november
it
could
face
significant
liability
in

of
its
insurance
coverage

its
equipment

found
to
have
caused

s
camp
