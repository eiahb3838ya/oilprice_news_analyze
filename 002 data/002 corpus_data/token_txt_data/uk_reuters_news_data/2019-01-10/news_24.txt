norway
will
step
up
preparations
to
claim
its
share
of
oil
and
gas
resources
if
russia
finds
petroleum
on
its
side
of
a
border
in
the
barents
sea
the
head
of
norwegian
petroleum
directorate
npd
said
on
thursday
norway
and
russia
in
agreed
a
maritime
border
in
the
barents
sea
ending
a
long
dispute
and
also
agreed
to
share
oil
and
gas
resources
spanning
that
border
russia
has
allowed
oil
and
gas
exploration
all
along
the
border
including
in
the
arctic
where
it
has
already
awarded
exploration
rights
to
rosneft
and
italy
s
eni
norway
currently
only
allows
oil
firms
to
explore
in
the
southern
part
of
the
barents
sea
but
if
russia
makes
any
discoveries
in
the
northern
part
of
the
sea
norway
wants
a
share
as
a
result
the
npd
which
manages
norway
s
oil
and
gas
resources
will
this
year
conduct
seismic
surveys
of
geological
structures
that
straddle
the
border
in
the
arctic
let
s
say
they
started
to
drill
close
to
the
border
and
there
is
a
structure
then
of
course
norway
would
like
to
get
the
resources
that
belong
to
norway
npd
head
bente
nyland
told
reuters
that
s
the
same
with
the
border
towards
uk
and
denmark
she
added
the
npd
will
conduct
the
surveys
in
the
areas
which
norway
has
not
opened
exploration
any
discoveries
on
the
russian
side
could
trigger
a
political
debate
in
oslo
about
the
need
to
open
those
areas
as
well
nyland
said
if
this
discoveries
happens
then
i
m
sure
that
there
will
be
a
situation
when
the
area
would
be
looked
at
more
closely
she
said
that
s
a
political
question
my
job
is
just
to
tell
where
we
expect
the
resources
to
be
nyland
added
when
asked
whether
she
saw
a
need
for
such
a
debate
opening
up
more
exploration
areas
could
be
politically
difficult
given
norway
s
climate
commitments
and
opposition
from
various
environmental
organisations
and
some
political
parties
the
npd
has
already
said
that
the
northern
part
of
the
barents
sea
was
expected
to
hold
more
resources
than
the
southern
part
the
southern
barents
sea
which
norway
has
opened
up
for
exploration
has
not
yielded
big
results
so
far
there
are
only
two
fields
one
gas
and
one
oil
in
operation
we
are
still
positive
about
the
barents
sea
but
a
hope
for
a
big
big
elephant
is
probably
is
not
present
in
the
barents
sea
south
nyland
said
but
we
made
johan
sverdrup
discovery
in
the
north
sea
after
years
of
exploration
so
you
should
never
say
never
