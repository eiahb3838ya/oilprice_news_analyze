agreed
to
a

in

china
s
commerce
ministry
said
on
thursday
the
talks
were
extensive
and
helped
establish
a
foundation
for
the
resolution
of
each
others
concerns
however
there
were
few
concrete
details
on
the
meetings
which
were
not
at

level

were
not

showed
the

both
increased
less
than
expected
in

with
the
latter
rising
at
the
slowest
pace
in
over
two
years
the
pace
of
increases
in
inflation
declined
for
a
second
straight
time
if
this
trend
persists
it
may
turn
negative
on

this

more
radical
stimulus

such
as

may
become

easing

said
he
viewed
more

in

prices
as
a
key
driver
for
any
further
rise
in

appetite
if
crude
futures
can
break
through
