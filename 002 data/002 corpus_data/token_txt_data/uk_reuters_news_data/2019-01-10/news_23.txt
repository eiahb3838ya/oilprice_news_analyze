norway
s
oil
output
in
will
be
smaller
than
previously
forecast
and
its
lowest
level
in
three
decades
although
it
should
rebound
in
the
following
years
the
country
s
oil
industry
regulator
said
on
thursday
investment
in
western
europe
s
largest
oil
producer
and
europe
s
gas
producer
behind
russia
is
surging
after
a
decline
due
to
the
slump
in
oil
prices
in
to
despite
that
oil
output
in
of
million
cubic
metres
mcm
or
million
barrels
missed
a
mcm
forecast
made
a
year
ago
the
norwegian
petroleum
directorate
npd
said
npd
head
bente
nyland
told
reuters
that
production
last
year
and
this
year
s
prediction
were
lower
than
previously
expected
due
to
delays
and
production
difficulties
at
several
fields
the
regulator
said
output
in
was
expected
to
be
mcm
against
a
previous
forecast
of
mcm
but
will
rise
to
over
million
cubic
metres
next
year
after
equinor
starts
its
giant
north
sea
johan
sverdrup
field
germany
s
wintershall
said
in
october
its
maria
field
in
norway
was
not
meeting
output
expectations
due
to
water
injection
issues
the
problems
have
not
been
solved
yet
nyland
said
norway
s
gas
production
last
year
stood
at
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
also
missing
a
bcm
forecast
in
it
is
expected
to
rise
slightly
to
bcm
but
still
below
a
previous
forecast
of
bcm
and
below
the
record
bcm
produced
in
norway
s
combined
oil
and
gas
production
is
expected
to
come
close
to
its
record
level
by
when
production
peaks
at
sverdrup
which
is
expected
to
account
for
about
percent
of
norwegian
oil
output
after
still
while
output
in
the
early
years
of
this
century
was
dominated
by
oil
the
majority
of
production
is
now
made
up
of
gas
npd
data
shows
the
agency
does
not
see
major
developments
that
will
lift
investment
after
following
the
commissioning
of
projects
such
as
sverdrup
and
the
arctic
johan
castberg
field
more
profitable
resources
must
be
proven
and
the
clock
is
ticking
nyland
said
in
a
statement
npd
expects
oil
firms
to
drill
about
the
same
number
of
exploration
wells
in
as
in
as
and
higher
oil
prices
raise
profitability
of
new
developments
costs
of
development
wells
fell
by
more
than
percent
from
to
but
operating
costs
are
flattening
and
exploration
costs
which
included
both
drilling
and
seismic
surveys
were
expected
to
rise
by
about
percent
in
from
npd
said
if
not
for
the
recent
drop
in
the
oil
price
the
cost
increases
going
forward
might
have
been
steeper
