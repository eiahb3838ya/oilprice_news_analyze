mexico
s
president
said
on
thursday
as
the
government
s
drive
to
stamp
out
gasoline
theft
from
pipelines
is
pressuring
the
distribution
of
supplies
from
terminals
across
the
country
declining
output
at
refineries
owned
and
operated
by
oil
company
petroleos
mexicanos
known
as
pemex
is
forcing
the
firm
to
meet
demand
by
relying
more
heavily
on
imported
motor
fuels
which
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
has
pledged
to
cut
once
more
gasoline
and
diesel
can
be
produced
at
home
there
are
pemex
refineries
that
have
been
shut
down
for
a
while
said
lopez
obrador
at
his
morning
news
conference
the
company
s
barrel
per
day
bpd
madero
refinery
has
not
produced
fuel
in
a
long
time
while
the
minatitlan
refinery
is
shut
down
or
producing
little
he
said
pemex
owns
and
operates
six
oil
refineries
in
mexico
with
a
joint
capacity
of
million
bpd
of
crude
processing
which
last
year
worked
below
half
capacity
leftist
lopez
obrador
who
won
a
landslide
election
on
promises
to
boost
domestic
refining
capacity
while
avoiding
gasoline
price
spikes
emphasized
that
the
country
has
enough
fuel
supplies
and
that
only
distribution
problems
persist
pemex
s
largest
refinery
the
salina
cruz
just
recently
resumed
production
the
president
said
without
offering
further
details
the
refinery
located
on
the
coast
of
southern
oaxaca
state
was
producing
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
gasoline
in
november
according
to
the
most
recent
published
pemex
data
the
facility
produced
about
bpd
of
gasoline
in
overall
pemex
s
refineries
are
producing
about
bpd
of
gasoline
according
to
official
numbers
while
another
bpd
are
being
imported
almost
all
of
which
comes
from
refiners
we
have
enough
gasoline
reserves
ships
are
arriving
we
have
enough
fuel
that
s
why
we
re
meeting
this
challenge
said
lopez
obrador
still
long
lines
of
drivers
are
forming
at
gas
stations
in
the
mexican
capital
as
well
as
in
several
states
since
earlier
this
week
as
the
government
crackdown
on
fuel
theft
has
led
to
slower
fuel
distribution
primarily
by
rail
and
trucks
meanwhile
at
key
mexican
import
hubs
bottlenecks
for
discharging
imported
fuel
have
formed
where
more
than
million
barrels
of
fuel
languish
