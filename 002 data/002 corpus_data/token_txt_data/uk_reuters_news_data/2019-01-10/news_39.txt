iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
on
thursday
sanctions
against
his
country
were
fully
illegal
and
tehran
would
not
comply
with
them
we
believe
that
we
should
not
comply
with
the
illegal
sanctions
against
iran
zanganeh
told
a
joint
news
conference
in
baghdad
with
his
iraqi
counterpart
thamer
zanganeh
also
said
iran
would
not
discuss
the
volume
or
destination
of
its
oil
exports
while
it
remained
under
sanctions
we
have
discussed
today
how
to
improve
cooperation
with
iraq
on
different
aspects
especially
on
oil
issues
zanganeh
said
ghadhban
who
also
said
the
discussions
had
touched
on
energy
issues
added
that
iraq
had
not
yet
reached
an
agreement
with
iran
to
develop
joint
oilfields
he
said
a
decline
in
global
oil
prices
had
stopped
and
that
he
expected
them
to
rise
gradually
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
of
which
iran
and
iraq
are
members
and
its
allies
agreed
on
to
cut
output
by
more
than
expected
despite
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
reduce
oil
prices
the
opec
deal
had
hung
in
the
balance
on
concerns
that
iran
whose
crude
exports
have
been
depleted
by
sanctions
would
receive
no
exemption
and
block
the
agreement
ghadhban
said
any
decision
relating
to
future
opec
cuts
would
depend
on
monitoring
price
developments
