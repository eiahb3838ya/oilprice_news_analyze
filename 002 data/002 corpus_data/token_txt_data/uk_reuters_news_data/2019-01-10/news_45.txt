bottlenecks
for
offloading
imported
fuel
are
forming
at
some
mexican
oil
ports
following
government
orders
to
shut
pipelines
to
limit
losses
from
widespread
fuel
theft
according
to
traders
and
refinitiv
eikon
data
with
storage
limited
in
mexico
the
move
by
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
to
shut
pipelines
and
move
fuel
mostly
by
rail
and
truck
has
slowed
transport
causing
long
lines
for
consumers
and
slowed
deliveries
at
ports
where
more
than
million
barrels
of
fuel
enough
for
several
days
of
use
in
mexico
languish
the
crackdown
on
fuel
theft
a
crime
that
has
drained
billions
of
dollars
from
state
coffers
and
is
blamed
for
rising
violence
in
some
regions
is
the
leftist
president
s
first
major
move
against
criminals
and
corruption
since
taking
office
in
december
but
risks
angering
consumers
and
hurting
the
economy
lines
of
drivers
snaked
from
gas
stations
in
mexico
city
on
wednesday
as
the
government
crackdown
on
fuel
theft
led
to
panic
purchases
despite
assurances
from
lopez
obrador
that
his
efforts
were
succeeding
petroleos
mexicanos
pemex
started
building
an
inventory
on
in
preparation
for
pipeline
closures
energy
minister
rocio
nahle
said
on
wednesday
she
denied
there
was
fuel
scarcity
in
mexico
which
is
among
the
world
s
top
four
importers
of
gasoline
but
fuel
distribution
to
stations
has
slowed
in
recent
days
because
of
a
switch
to
much
less
efficient
truck
transportation
backlogs
of
tankers
bringing
imported
fuel
have
started
forming
around
pemex
s
maritime
terminals
which
are
not
draining
inventories
at
their
typical
rhythm
also
creating
delays
for
tanker
unloading
the
traders
said
as
of
mexico
s
main
port
of
entry
for
fuel
imports
pajaritos
in
the
gulf
had
tankers
waiting
to
discharge
some
of
them
since
december
the
neighboring
tuxpan
terminal
had
tankers
waiting
to
discharge
gasoline
and
other
fuel
including
liquefied
petroleum
gas
lpg
according
to
the
eikon
data
the
vessels
are
jointly
carrying
about
million
barrels
of
fuel
enough
for
nearly
five
days
of
consumption
as
limitations
to
import
fuel
by
vessel
have
grown
pemex
s
trading
arm
pmi
has
tapped
suppliers
to
secure
fuel
by
rail
from
the
united
states
one
of
the
traders
added
pmi
is
securing
as
much
by
rail
as
possible
both
for
gasoline
and
ultra
low
sulfur
diesel
ulsd
this
is
limited
by
the
rail
loading
and
unloading
capabilities
still
in
both
the
and
mexico
the
trader
said
the
company
has
had
no
problems
finding
suppliers
in
the
united
states
another
trader
said
adding
that
fuel
shortages
in
some
areas
of
mexico
are
not
the
result
of
fewer
imports
but
caused
by
domestic
distribution
hiccups
pemex
is
producing
some
bpd
of
gasoline
lopez
obrador
said
slightly
above
november
s
average
of
bpd
there
s
enough
fuel
in
the
country
lopez
obrador
said
on
monday
he
said
that
retail
domestic
prices
have
not
increased
mostly
because
of
lower
international
prices
but
pemex
s
fuel
production
dropped
by
percent
from
january
to
november
of
last
year
compared
with
all
of
and
it
has
recently
struggled
to
maintain
refineries
in
service
to
compensate
for
declining
domestic
fuel
output
pemex
has
ramped
up
imports
for
last
year
through
november
it
purchased
bpd
about
two
thirds
of
mexico
s
consumption
compared
with
the
bpd
it
imported
in
which
represented
percent
of
consumption
some
independent
retailers
that
started
operating
in
mexico
because
of
the
energy
reform
are
separately
importing
themselves
all
the
purchases
are
making
mexico
increasingly
dependent
on
imported
fuel
mostly
from
the
united
states
but
the
country
still
only
has
enough
storage
capacity
for
three
days
of
consumption
causing
bottlenecks
to
show
up
quickly
more
vessels
booked
from
west
coast
refineries
in
december
are
on
the
way
causing
more
of
a
logjam
if
the
plan
was
to
use
trucks
instead
of
pipelines
to
move
product
it
has
failed
