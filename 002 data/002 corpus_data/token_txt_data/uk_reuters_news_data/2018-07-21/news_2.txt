riyadh
reuters
saudi
aramco
s
potential
acquisition
of
a
stake
in
petrochemicals
maker
sabic
would
affect
the
timeframe
of
its
own
planned
initial
public
offering
the
firm
s
chief
executive
amin
nasser
said
in
a
tv
interview
the
offering
is
the
centerpiece
of
an
ambitious
plan
championed
by
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
to
diversify
saudi
arabia
s
economy
beyond
oil
but
preparations
for
the
ipo
which
could
prove
the
biggest
in
history
have
slowed
al
arabiya
television
cited
nasser
as
saying
that
buying
a
stake
in
a
petrochemicals
company
would
make
the
state
oil
giant
less
vulnerable
to
price
volatility
if
the
deal
is
completed
with
relevant
regulations
taken
into
account
it
will
definitely
affect
the
timeframe
for
the
partial
ipo
of
saudi
aramco
he
said
in
a
transcript
provided
by
the
government
media
office
aramco
said
on
thursday
it
was
looking
to
buy
a
strategic
stake
in
sabic
which
could
boost
its
market
valuation
ahead
of
a
planned
ipo
when
aramco
is
ready
to
list
the
ipo
timing
would
be
up
to
the
government
to
decide
nasser
said
as
i
said
in
previous
interviews
when
saudi
aramco
is
ready
the
decision
of
going
ahead
with
the
ipo
is
for
the
state
to
make
he
said
on
thursday
aramco
said
it
was
in
very
discussions
with
the
kingdom
s
public
investment
fund
pif
to
acquire
the
sabic
stake
in
a
private
transaction
and
had
no
plans
to
acquire
any
publicly
held
shares
saudi
basic
industries
corp
sabic
the
world
s
petrochemicals
company
is
percent
owned
by
the
pif
saudi
arabia
s
top
sovereign
wealth
fund
it
has
a
market
capitalization
of
billion
saudi
riyals
billion
nasser
also
said
aramco
had
a
goal
to
convert
million
to
million
barrels
of
its
oil
products
into
chemicals
nasser
said
the
proposed
deal
with
sabic
would
help
balance
revenues
from
excavation
and
production
with
those
from
refining
and
chemicals
that
normally
remain
strong
even
when
oil
prices
dip
reuters
reported
on
wednesday
that
saudi
aramco
had
invited
banks
to
pitch
for
an
advisory
role
on
the
potential
acquisition
of
a
strategic
stake
in
sabic
citing
two
sources
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
matter
some
sources
close
to
the
saudi
aramco
ipo
process
have
said
the
plans
for
a
domestic
and
international
listing
might
be
pushed
further
into
next
year
or
beyond
a
final
decision
has
yet
to
be
made
by
prince
mohammed
who
oversees
the
kingdom
s
economic
and
oil
policies
the
sources
said
saudi
arabia
s
energy
minister
khalid
said
last
month
it
would
be
nice
to
see
aramco
floated
in
adding
that
the
timing
was
not
critical
to
the
government
aramco
plans
to
boost
investments
in
refining
and
petrochemicals
to
secure
new
markets
and
sees
growth
in
chemicals
as
central
to
its
downstream
strategy
to
cut
the
risk
of
an
oil
demand
slowdown
