update 2-iran leader backs suggestion to block gulf oil exports if own sales stopped
dubai
reuters
iran
s
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
on
saturday
backed
president
hassan
rouhani
s
suggestion
that
iran
may
block
gulf
oil
exports
if
its
own
exports
are
stopped
and
said
negotiations
with
the
united
states
would
be
an
obvious
mistake
rouhani
s
apparent
threat
earlier
this
month
to
disrupt
oil
shipments
from
neighboring
countries
came
in
reaction
to
looming
sanctions
and
efforts
by
washington
to
force
all
countries
to
stop
buying
iranian
oil
khamenei
said
remarks
by
the
president
that
if
iran
s
oil
is
not
exported
no
regional
country
s
oil
will
be
exported
were
important
remarks
that
reflect
the
policy
and
the
approach
of
iran
s
system
khamenei
s
official
website
said
iranian
officials
have
in
the
past
threatened
to
block
the
strait
of
hormuz
a
major
oil
shipping
route
in
retaliation
for
any
hostile
action
khamenei
used
a
speech
to
foreign
ministry
officials
on
saturday
to
reject
any
renewed
talks
with
the
united
states
after
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
withdraw
from
a
international
deal
over
iran
s
nuclear
program
the
word
and
even
the
signature
of
the
americans
can
not
be
relied
upon
so
negotiations
with
america
are
of
no
avail
khamenei
said
it
would
be
an
obvious
mistake
to
negotiate
with
the
united
states
as
washington
was
unreliable
khamenei
added
according
to
his
website
the
endorsement
by
khamenei
who
has
the
last
word
on
all
major
issues
of
state
is
likely
to
discourage
any
open
opposition
to
rouhani
s
apparent
threat
khamenei
also
voiced
support
for
continued
talks
with
iran
s
european
partners
in
the
nuclear
deal
which
are
preparing
a
package
of
economic
measures
to
offset
the
pullout
from
the
accord
negotiations
with
the
europeans
should
not
be
stopped
but
we
should
not
be
just
waiting
for
the
european
package
but
instead
we
should
follow
up
on
necessary
activities
inside
the
country
against
sanctions
khamenei
said
france
said
earlier
this
month
that
it
was
unlikely
european
powers
would
be
able
to
put
together
an
economic
package
for
iran
that
would
salvage
its
nuclear
deal
before
november
iran
s
oil
exports
could
fall
by
as
much
as
by
the
end
of
the
year
because
of
new
sanctions
putting
oil
markets
under
huge
strain
amid
supply
outages
elsewhere
in
the
world
washington
initially
planned
to
totally
shut
iran
out
of
global
oil
markets
after
trump
abandoned
the
deal
that
limited
iran
s
nuclear
ambitions
demanding
all
other
countries
to
stop
buying
its
crude
by
november
but
it
has
since
somewhat
eased
its
stance
saying
that
it
may
grant
sanction
waivers
to
some
allies
that
are
particularly
reliant
on
iranian
supplies
