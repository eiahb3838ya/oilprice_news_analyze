urged
regulators
to
stick
to
their
ruling
denying
magellan
midstream
partners
permission
to
form
a
marketing
affiliate
saying
the
move
would
undercut
other
oil
shippers
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
ferc
in
november
denied
a
proposal
by
magellan
to
create
a
marketing
affiliate
to
buy
sell
and
ship
crude
oil
on
grounds
it
would
essentially
be
offering
pipeline
space
below
cost
which
is
against
the
law
magellan
requested
a
rehearing
on
in
a
filing
that
rivals
have
criticized
the
companies
contend
that
the
request
raised
broader
issues
that
could
jeopardise
the
existing
structure
of
oil
trading
on
pipelines
most
of
the
top

pipeline
operators
have
already
established
their
own

ferc
late

it
was
concerned
about
the
negative
impact
to
the
market
when
affiliated
marketing
and
pipeline
companies
act
in
a
coordinated
fashion
because
it
gives
pipeline
companies
ways
to
get
around
rates
shell
also
asked
ferc
to
hold
a
generic
proceeding
