column-commodities' dilemma: strong china demand or trump-led fears?: russell
the
opinions
expressed
here
are
those
of

the
between
fundamentals
and
sentiment
appears
to
be
getting
stronger
for
many
commodities
as
the
market
tries
to
reconcile
factors
such
as
robust
demand
numbers
from
china
and
increasingly
worrying
rhetoric
and
actions
from
the
united
states
iron
ore
steel
and
copper
all
performed
well
on
wednesday
after
chinese
data
showed
real
estate
investment
and
industrial
output
rising
at
a
faster
than
expected
pace
spot
iron
ore
prices
in
china
rose
percent
to
close
at
a
tonne
while
copper
futures
gained
percent
to
a
tonne
china
s
real
estate
investment
over
the
first
two
months
of
the
year
grew
percent
from
the
same
period
a
year
ago
marking
the
fastest
pace
since
industrial
output
in
the
january
to
february
period
gained
percent
from
the
same
period
in
beating
the
market
consensus
forecast
of
a
rise
of
percent
and
coming
in
well
above
december
s
percent
growth
rate
given
that
property
and
industry
are
among
the
major
consumers
of
commodities
like
steel
and
copper
the
price
gains
aren
t
that
surprising
as
they
seem
to
indicate
that
china
s
economy
remains
in
a
healthy
state
and
likely
to
support
strength
in
commodity
imports
in
coming
months
indeed
china
s
imports
of
major
commodities
were
solid
in
the
first
two
months
of
the
year
with
customs
data
last
week
showing
iron
ore
imports
up
percent
from
the
january
to
february
period
last
year
crude
oil
up
by
percent
copper
by
percent
and
coal
by
percent
but
despite
the
strength
in
china
s
commodity
demand
prices
have
at
best
meandered
so
far
in
with
iron
ore
down
percent
from
the
end
of
to
wednesday
s
close
lme
copper
lower
by
percent
and
brent
crude
oil
down
by
almost
percent
while
china
isn
t
the
sole
factor
driving
commodity
prices
it
s
clear
that
the
current
positive
demand
picture
isn
t
enough
to
spark
or
even
sustain
a
rally
instead
market
participants
seem
once
again
focused
on
the
mounting
risks
posed
by
geopolitics
particularly
in
the
form
of
the
agenda
of
president
donald
trump
the
imposition
of
a
percent
tariff
on
steel
imports
and
percent
on
aluminium
spooked
markets
far
more
than
the
positive
china
data
supported
them
trump
first
announced
he
planned
to
impose
the
tariffs
on
march
and
iron
ore
prices
fell
percent
between
march
and
before
recovering
slightly
on
the
chinese
economic
data
china
s
exports
of
steel
to
the
united
states
are
a
miniscule
percent
of
its
total
production
so
in
theory
the
tariffs
are
inconsequential
and
should
have
zero
to
minimal
impact
on
the
country
s
demand
for
seaborne
iron
ore
yet
iron
ore
prices
slumped
on
the
news
of
trump
s
tariffs
not
because
of
the
expected
immediate
impact
on
demand
but
rather
on
the
concern
that
the
government
is
prepared
to
wage
a
trade
war
than
runs
the
risk
of
sparking
the
next
global
recession
the
potential
for
trump
s
policies
to
impact
other
commodities
is
also
looming
large
with
the
firing
of
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
and
his
planned
with
replacement
with
central
intelligence
agency
head
mike
pompeo
raising
concerns
over
the
future
of
iran
s
crude
exports
pompeo
is
believed
to
be
more
aligned
to
trump
s
view
that
the
deal
between
western
powers
iran
over
the
islamic
republic
s
nuclear
programme
was
bad
and
needs
to
be
this
raises
the
chance
of
the
administration
the
nuclear
deal
a
move
that
could
lead
to
restrictions
on
iran
s
crude
exports
an
eventuality
that
could
tighten
the
market
and
raise
prices
brent
crude
futures
didn
t
show
much
reaction
to
tillerson
s
sacking
gaining
a
mere
percent
on
wednesday
but
what
trump
has
done
for
crude
oil
and
for
other
commodities
is
put
geopolitical
risk
back
on
the
agenda
while
it
may
not
yet
have
displaced
the
interplay
between
supply
and
demand
as
the
main
driver
of
markets
a
focus
on
geopolitics
has
to
be
on
the
radar
screen
of
producers
traders
investors
and
buyers
commodity
markets
with
deep
and
liquid
markets
such
as
crude
oil
and
natural
gas
are
more
at
risk
of
sharp
increases
in
volatility
but
even
those
where
futures
contracts
are
limited
such
as
coal
iron
ore
and
liquefied
natural
gas
will
be
affected
