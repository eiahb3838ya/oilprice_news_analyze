reuters
president
donald
trump
has
bashed
international
efforts
to
combat
climate
change
and
questioned
the
scientific
consensus
that
global
warming
is
dangerous
and
driven
by
human
consumption
of
fossil
fuels
but
there
is
a
disconnect
between
what
trump
says
at
home
and
what
his
government
does
abroad
while
attention
has
been
focused
on
trump
s
rhetoric
state
department
envoys
federal
agencies
and
government
scientists
remain
active
participants
in
international
efforts
to
both
research
and
fight
climate
change
according
to
and
foreign
representatives
involved
in
those
efforts
we
really
don
t
detect
any
change
with
the
americans
said
one
of
the
officials
aleksi
härkönen
of
finland
who
chairs
the
arctic
council
s
key
group
of
senior
officials
who
are
charged
with
protecting
a
region
warming
faster
than
any
other
on
earth
over
the
past
year
the
united
states
has
helped
draft
the
rulebook
for
implementing
the
paris
climate
accord
signed
international
memoranda
calling
for
global
action
to
fight
climate
change
boosted
funding
for
overseas
clean
energy
projects
and
contributed
to
global
research
on
the
dangers
and
causes
of
the
earth
s
warming
while
the
united
states
participation
in
international
forums
including
the
paris
accord
and
the
arctic
council
has
been
reported
its
continued
broad
and
constructive
support
for
climate
change
efforts
in
these
gatherings
has
not
this
approach
has
surprised
some
of
america
s
foreign
partners
along
with
some
of
trump
s
allies
who
had
expected
the
new
administration
to
match
its
rhetoric
with
an
obstructionist
approach
to
combating
climate
change
i
am
concerned
that
much
of
our
climate
policy
remains
on
autopilot
complained
trump
s
former
energy
adviser
myron
ebell
now
a
research
director
at
the
competitive
enterprise
institute
who
said
it
reflects
a
failure
by
the
administration
to
fill
key
positions
and
replace
staffers
who
oppose
the
president
s
agenda
the
efforts
abroad
to
tackle
climate
change
have
been
by
trump
s
aggressive
push
at
home
to
increase
production
of
the
fossil
fuels
scientists
blame
for
global
warming
he
has
also
ordered
a
rollback
of
climate
regulations
and
appointed
a
climate
skeptic
scott
pruitt
as
the
nation
s
chief
environmental
regulator
and
to
be
sure
none
of
the
dealings
in
international
climate
efforts
since
last
year
have
committed
the
united
states
to
any
emissions
cuts
that
would
undermine
trump
s
domestic
energy
agenda
the
state
department
which
handles
the
bulk
of
climate
policy
abroad
told
reuters
it
was
still
developing
its
global
warming
policy
under
trump
the
state
department
is
working
with
the
white
house
and
the
interagency
to
further
develop
our
approach
to
international
climate
change
diplomacy
state
department
spokesman
ambrose
sayles
said
in
a
statement
before
trump
sacked
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
on
tuesday
in
the
meantime
we
will
continue
to
participate
to
ensure
a
level
playing
field
that
benefits
and
protects
interests
and
to
keep
all
options
open
for
the
president
sayles
said
tillerson
s
departure
leaves
a
question
mark
over
the
future
of
climate
policy
abroad
tillerson
was
in
favor
of
the
paris
accord
while
his
successor
mike
pompeo
has
expressed
doubts
about
the
science
of
climate
change
climate
advocates
say
they
hope
pompeo
will
be
too
distracted
by
tensions
with
iran
and
north
korea
to
change
the
state
department
s
approach
to
climate
change
white
house
spokeswoman
kelly
love
declined
to
comment
trump
announced
last
year
that
he
was
withdrawing
the
united
states
from
the
paris
agreement
to
fight
global
warming
raising
concerns
among
other
parties
to
the
deal
that
washington
might
attempt
to
torpedo
the
accord
or
disengage
from
it
completely
that
hasn
t
happened
washington
sent
a
delegation
to
talks
in
bonn
in
november
to
help
draft
a
new
rulebook
that
will
provide
rules
of
the
road
for
the
participating
nations
it
was
a
smaller
delegation
than
washington
had
sent
to
past
meetings
but
it
still
won
praise
from
fellow
delegates
for
its
work
for
example
andrew
rakestraw
a
climate
negotiator
for
the
state
department
since
discussions
on
how
to
ensure
that
the
pledges
by
signatories
are
comparable
and
use
the
same
accounting
standards
a
point
seen
as
critical
to
the
success
of
the
accord
nazhat
shameem
khan
chief
negotiator
for
fiji
which
presided
over
the
talks
said
the
united
states
delegation
was
constructive
and
the
s
climate
chief
patricia
espinosa
also
called
the
role
constructive
thomas
shannon
the
state
department
s
chief
climate
negotiator
in
bonn
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
rakestraw
also
did
not
respond
to
calls
and
emails
requesting
comment
a
source
familiar
with
the
position
at
the
talks
who
asked
not
to
be
named
said
that
delegates
in
bonn
were
pushing
an
agenda
that
resembled
those
of
past
administrations
stressing
that
emerging
economies
like
china
follow
the
same
rules
as
developed
nations
and
meet
international
standards
for
monitoring
and
reporting
emissions
there
was
one
jarring
note
washington
sponsored
a
side
event
to
promote
clean
some
other
delegates
said
they
were
unhappy
with
this
as
they
wanted
the
talks
to
focus
on
renewable
energies
under
the
details
of
the
accord
the
united
states
can
not
formally
withdraw
until
the
state
department
s
delegations
to
the
arctic
council
are
also
continuing
their
work
in
much
the
same
way
they
did
under
president
barack
obama
acknowledging
that
warming
is
real
and
should
be
countered
in
planning
everything
from
new
shipping
routes
to
the
protection
of
indigenous
peoples
some
agencies
are
also
still
bolstering
international
efforts
to
fight
climate
change
the
overseas
private
investment
corporation
which
seeks
to
advance
policy
by
financing
foreign
business
ventures
doubled
its
support
for
solar
projects
in
under
a
policy
last
updated
by
the
obama
administration
and
nasa
the
space
agency
continues
to
research
climate
change
publish
climate
change
data
and
contribute
to
international
reports
spokesman
stephen
cole
said
both
opic
and
nasa
are
independent
of
the
state
department
so
would
not
be
under
pompeo
s
sway
scientists
representing
the
united
states
in
international
research
say
they
have
also
been
unfettered
by
the
trump
administration
despite
concerns
early
in
the
trump
presidency
that
the
white
house
would
seek
to
silence
them
or
restrict
their
work
there
has
been
no
pressure
on
authors
said
one
scientist
who
is
now
helping
to
write
a
united
nations
report
that
will
call
for
coal
to
be
phased
out
rapidly
to
limit
global
warming
a
direct
clash
with
trump
s
agenda
the
scientist
asked
not
to
be
named
because
the
draft
report
from
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
due
to
be
released
in
october
is
confidential
our
colleagues
know
that
climate
change
is
not
a
hoax
said
one
of
the
authors
of
the
same
report
who
also
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
christopher
field
a
professor
of
environmental
studies
at
stanford
university
who
a
ipcc
report
on
the
impacts
of
climate
change
agreed
i
ve
not
seen
any
indication
that
the
climate
denialism
from
trump
and
other
members
of
the
administration
has
had
any
influence
on
the
alignment
of
the
scientific
community
with
the
scientific
consensus
around
the
still
scientists
worry
that
while
the
trump
administration
is
not
interfering
with
their
research
it
is
ignoring
it
the
trump
administration
made
no
move
to
block
an
assessment
by
experts
last
year
that
outlined
the
threats
and
causes
of
warming
in
the
united
states
and
concluded
there
is
no
convincing
alternative
explanation
for
climate
change
than
human
activity
but
then
they
haven
t
acknowledged
the
findings
nor
changed
their
climate
science
denying
stance
said
the
scientist
involved
in
drafting
the
coal
report
