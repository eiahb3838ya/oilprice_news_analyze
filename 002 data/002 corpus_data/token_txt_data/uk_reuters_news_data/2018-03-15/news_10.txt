france considers developing mini nuclear reactors, eyes cost
paris
reuters
the
french
nuclear
industry
is
considering
developing
small
modular
reactors
smrs
but
will
have
to
ensure
these
miniaturised
generators
are
not
only
technically
feasible
but
also
financially
viable
executives
said
framatome
formerly
called
areva
builds
the
world
s
largest
nuclear
reactor
model
the
epr
but
is
now
also
conducting
research
into
small
to
reactors
with
state
nuclear
agency
cea
in
france
we
have
always
preferred
reactors
but
we
need
to
also
consider
smaller
models

head
of
new

at
an
innovation
seminar
organised
by
french

sfen
says
small
reactors
could
be
suitable
for
countries
regions
or
islands
that
are
isolated
from
the
main
regional
power
grids
and
could
also
be
useful
for
urban
heating
networks
or
seawater
desalination
cea
head
of
nuclear
energy
françois
gauché
said
the
agency
would
study
the
technical
and
financial
feasibility
of
smrs
in
the
coming
months
he
said
some
organisations
notably
nuscale
by
fluor
corp
had
submitted
smr
models
to
their
nuclear
regulators
for
design
approval
philippe
knoche
chief
executive
of
french
nuclear
fuel
group
orano
said
factory
production
as
opposed
to
construction
for
big
reactors
could
lower
the
cost
of
smrs
making
them
competitive
if
manufacturers
built
dozens
critics
say
smr
economies
of
scale
will
be
limited
because
each
reactor
will
need
its
own
control
and
safety
systems
they
also
point
at
the
danger
of
spreading
radioactive
material
more
widely
increasing
radiation
and
security
risks

british
government
said
in
december
it
would
provide
funding

research
