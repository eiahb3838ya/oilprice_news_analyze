qatar
s
government
will
restrain
current
spending
to
achieve
small
budget
surpluses
and
transfer
less
money
to
its
sovereign
wealth
fund
in
coming
years
if
oil
and
gas
prices
do
not
rise
according
to
the
country
s
new
development
plan
the
national
development
strategy
for
released
by
prime
minister
sheikh
abdullah
bin
nasser
on
wednesday
calls
for
the
economy
to
become
more
in
food
production
and
efficient
in
energy
use
as
it
faces
a
boycott
by
saudi
arabia
and
three
other
arab
states
the
plan
says
the
government
will
continue
spending
heavily
on
infrastructure
including
projects
related
to
qatar
s
hosting
of
the
world
cup
soccer
tournament
in
but
as
the
government
seeks
to
become
more
efficient
its
current
spending
recurring
expenditure
on
goods
and
services
will
average
about
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
in
down
from
percent
in
the
plan
says
the
government
would
run
small
fiscal
surpluses
during
the
period
and
gdp
growth
would
average
between
and
percent
with
higher
private
sector
investment
in
response
to
regulatory
reforms
compensating
for
slower
growth
in
the
energy
sector
the
projections
assume
that
average
oil
and
gas
prices
in
will
be
in
line
with
their
levels
in
january
when
brent
oil
was
trading
around
a
barrel
that
implies
there
is
room
for
more
strength
in
the
economy
and
state
finances
than
expected
brent
is
currently
around
but
the
plan
says
there
is
no
reason
to
expect
noticeable
rises
above
in
the
medium
term
so
rationalisation
in
public
spending
will
continue
until
fiscal
balance
is
the
government
ran
moderate
fiscal
deficits
in
and
and
gdp
growth
averaged
percent
between
and
according
to
international
monetary
fund
data
the
plan
predicts
qatar
s
current
account
surpluses
will
shrink
in
as
the
government
and
private
sector
import
goods
and
services
for
investment
projects
this
will
lead
to
lower
net
transfers
of
money
to
the
sovereign
fund
the
qatar
investment
authority
and
a
fall
in
the
national
savings
rate
to
percent
from
