a
break
in
the
recent
global
trade
war
squalls
helped
lift
european
stocks
on
thursday
and
cooled
demand
for
the
markets
traditional
safety
plays
of
government
bonds
and
gold
results
from

heavyweights
munich
re
generali
and
old
mutual
also
helped
europe
s
mood
but
it
was
mainly
relief
that
for
now
at
least
donald
trump
s
trade
war
drum
wasn
t
beating
any
harder
the
dollar
consolidated
a
modest
bounce
following
three
days
of
losses
while
the
big
credit
market
benchmarks
of
treasuries
and
german
bunds
both
saw

the
first
time
in
four

and
tabloid
the
global
times
had
added
to
the
trade

talk
overnight
saying
the
was
trying
to
play
the
victim
germany
s
economic
ministry
then
said
a
trade
war
could
cause
tangible
damage
in
an
ominous
sign
for
trump
s
republicans
eight
months
before
national
elections
meanwhile
a
moderate
democrat
candidate
looked
to
have
won
what
should
have
been
a
congressional
election
for
republicans
in
pennsylvania
the
big
questions
the
market
has
is
about
politics
in
the
united
states
at
the
moment
and
about
trade
policy
said
nouen
chief
economic

at
lazard
fr√®res
gestion
exporters
have
been
a
bit
weak
and
you
can
see
there
are
some
worries
about
whether
other
countries
will
retaliate
but
you
really
have
to
stick
to
the
economic
outlook
and
in
fact
we
think
the
economic
outlook
remains
very
the
percent
bounce
in
european
stocks
came
after
a
subdued
asian
session
which
itself
had
followed
another
bumpy
day
on
wall
street
during
which
global
planemaker
boeing
was
hit
particularly
hard
shanghai
lost
percent
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
was
flat
and
australian
stocks
fell
percent
japan
s
nikkei
though
erased
early
losses
to
finish
up
percent
despite
a
stronger
yen
and
an
ongoing
scandal
surrounding
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
and
finance
minister
taro
aso
abe
has
denied
wrongdoing
by
himself
or
his
wife
and
aso
has
denied
instructing
any
japan
s
equity
market
has
been
holding
up
relatively
well
but
it
will
have
to
decline
some
more
if
shares
deepen
their
losses
said
yutaka
miura
senior
technical
analyst
at
mizuho
securities
in
tokyo
there
was
bright
news
elsewhere
in
the
region
too
china
s
president
xi
jinping
offered
encouragement
for
south
korea
s
initiative
to
nurture
peaceful
engagement
with
north
korea
and
russia
also
expressed
support
north
korean
foreign
minister
ri
yong
ho
will
begin
a
rare
visit
on
thursday
to
sweden
which
represents
the
united
states
diplomatically
in
the
isolated
country
the
swedish
foreign
ministry
also
said
the
dollar
index
which
measures
it
against
a
basket
of
six
other
major
currencies
barely
budged
at
and
at
per
euro
in
european
trading
having
fallen
almost
percent
so
far
this
month
sterling
was
at
a
day
s
low
at
just
under
the
day
after
britain
said
it
was
expelling
russian
diplomats
over
the
poisoning
of
former
russian
spy
living
in
britain
last
week
russia
s
foreign
ministry
spokeswoman
maria
zakharova
told
a
news
briefing
that
moscow
would
soon
retaliate
in
metals
markets
gold
lost
some
of
its
appeal
with
spot
prices
dipping
percent
to
an
ounce
oil
prices
held
steady
though
with
brent
crude
futures
at
per
barrel
and
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
futures
fractionally
higher
a
barrel
the
market
is
being
supported
by
healthy
global
demand
but
that
is
being
offset
by
a
relentless
rise
in
production
that
is
undermining
efforts
led
by
opec
to
cut
supplies
and
prop
up
prices
