cameroon
s
octogenarian
president
paul
biya
who
has
ruled
the
central
african
country
with
an
iron
grip
for
decades
held
his
first
cabinet
meeting
since
on
thursday
using
it
to
urge
better
economic
policy
and
touting
successes
against
insurgents
biya
very
rarely
convenes
his
cabinet
and
past
meetings
have
resembled
lectures
more
than
discussions
it
was
not
clear
if
anyone
else
spoke
on
thursday
the
letter
calling
his
council
of
ministers
to
the
unity
palace
did
not
reveal
the
agenda
but
unusually
later
in
the
day
the
president
s
office
published
his
speech
despite
an
unfavourable
global
economic
context
the
improvement
of
our
people
s
living
conditions
and
the
fight
against
unemployment
must
remain
the
government
s
core
priorities
biya
told
them
biya
has
ruled
virtually
by
decree
since
taking
over
from
a
retiring
predecessor
in
and
then
winning
an
election
by
percent
a
year
later
the
meeting
came
as
cameroon
which
is
mostly
faces
a
violent
separatist
movement
in
its
western
anglophone
region
and
a
much
more
deadly
threat
from
islamist
militant
group
boko
haram
in
the
north
thanks
to
the
firm
action
of
our
defence
and
security
forces
we
have
been
able
to
drastically
curb
the
atrocities
perpetrated
by
criminal
groups
in
the
far
north
and
regions
biya
said
the
economy
has
been
sluggish
because
of
low
prices
for
its
main
exports
of
oil
and
cocoa
and
falling
crude
oil
production
it
was
not
by
helped
a
shutdown
in
the
economy
of
its
restive
western
region
which
before
a
crackdown
began
in
had
been
emerging
as
an
unlikely
hub
for
tech
firms
cameroon
currently
ranks
on
the
human
development
index
and
average
life
expectancy
is
biya
urged
his
cabinet
to
provide
concrete
answers
to
the
legitimate
concerns
of
our
people
as
in
the
last
cabinet
meeting
in
october
he
urged
ministers
to
make
extra
efforts
to
prepare
for
cameroon
s
hosting
of
the
soccer
africa
cup
of
nations
next
year
i
strongly
reiterate
my
instructions
on
the
need
for
judicious
use
of
public
resources
reduction
of
public
spending
and
the
fight
against
corruption
he
told
the
council
outside
of
such
meetings
biya
often
meets
his
ministers
at
the
airport
between
private
trips
abroad
on
chartered
flights
with
his
wife
chantal
famed
locally
for
her
luxurious
dresses
and
bouffant
hairdo
their
favourite
destination
is
switzerland
