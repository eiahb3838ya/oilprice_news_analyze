a
brief
break
in
global
trade
squalls
helped
to
nudge
stocks
and
the
dollar
higher
on
thursday
though
the
risk
they
could
return
at
any
time
also
meant
investors

also
helped
europe

mood
but
it
was
mainly
relief
that

now
at

donald
trump
s
trade
war
drum
wasn
t
beating
any
louder
wall
street
was
pointing
modestly
higher
as
well
after
a
bumpy
session
on
wednesday
and
the
dollar
managed
a
small
bounce
after
three
days
of
losses
though
not
against
the
yen
the
big
questions
the
market
has
are
about
politics
in
the
united
states
at
the
moment
and
about
trade
policy

exporters
have
been
a
bit
weak
and
you
can
see
there
are
some
worries
about
whether
other
countries
will
retaliate
but
you
really
have
to
stick
to
the
economic
outlook
and
in
fact
we
think
the
economic
outlook
remains
very
the
trade
tensions

t
gone
off
the
boil
completely
china

widely
read
tabloid

global
times
said
the
united
states
was
trying
to
play
the
victim
with
its
claims
of
trade
imbalances
while
europe
s
export
powerhouse
germany
warned
that
a
trade
war
could
cause
tangible
damage
the

and
german
bunds
steadied
after
a
brief
early
european
if
they
manage
a
fourth
day

it
will
be
the
longest

national
economic
council
had
said
on

that
china
had
earned
a
tough
response
on
trade
even
though
he
has
previously
criticised
blanket
tariffs
he
also
said
he
would
like
to
see
the
dollar
a
wee
bit
stronger
than
it
is
currently
in
an
ominous
sign
for
trump
s
republicans
eight
months
before
national
elections
a
moderate
democrat
candidate
looked
to
have
won
what

have
been
a
congressional

in
pennsylvania
the

index
which

of
trading
and
at

whereas
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
ended
flat
and
japan
s
nikkei

just
about
up
despite
a
stronger
yen
and
an
ongoing
scandal
surrounding
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
and
finance
minister
taro
aso
abe
has
denied
wrongdoing
by
himself
or
his

a
row
over
the
discounted
sale
of

to
a
school
operator
japan
s
equity
market
has
been
holding
up
relatively
well
but
will
have
to
decline
if

deepen
their
losses
said
yutaka
miura
senior
technical
analyst
at
mizuho
securities
in
tokyo
there
was
brighter
news
elsewhere
in
the
region
as
china

offered
encouragement
for
south
korea
s
initiative
to
nurture
peaceful
engagement
with
north
korea
and
russia
also
expressed
support
north
korean
foreign

has
also
begun
a
rare
visit
to
sweden
which
represents
the
united

diplomatically
in
the
isolated
country
the
swedish
foreign
ministry
said
on
thursday
the
norwegian
crown
rose
to
its
highest
in
four
months
after
the
country
s
central
bank
signalled
that
its
first
rate
rise
in
seven
years
will
come
earlier
than
previously
expected
sterling
though
was
back
below
as
britain
and
russia
continued
to
trade
barbs
a
day
after
the
uk
said
it
would
expel
russian
diplomats
over
the
poisoning
of
a
former
russian
spy
living
in
britain
russian
foreign
minister
sergei
lavrov
accused
london
of
behaving
in
a
boorish
way
with
the
expulsions
and
that
moscow
s
response
would
come
very
soon
there
was
also
more
brexit

for
the

france
s

watchdog
said
the
european
union
s
system
for
granting
financial
market
access
would
have
to
be
toughened
up
after

unilever
meanwhile
said
it
was
scrapping

held
steady

fractionally
higher
at
the
market
is
being
supported
by
healthy
global
demand
but
that
is
being
offset
by
a
relentless
rise
in
production
that
is
undermining
efforts
to
cut
supplies
and
prop
up
prices
