aurizon
holdings
said
on
thursday
said
it
was
committed
to
completing
the
proposed
sale
of
its
freight
business
by
july
after
the
country
s
competition
watchdog
raised
concerns
about
the
plan
aurizon
said
it
would
make
detailed
submissions
to
the
australian
competition
and
consumer
commission
accc
about
the
matter
and
reiterated
that
it
would
close
the
business
if
the
sale
did
not
go
through
with
the
loss
of
up
to
jobs
the
regulator
said
it
was
concerned
the
sale
which
would
combine
the
only
two
railway
haulers
in
the
state
of
queensland
could
lead
to
increased
prices
and
reduced
service
for
freight
hauled
between
the
capital
brisbane
and
the
state
s
far
north
we
are
concerned
about
the
impact
on
competition
in
the
freight
industry
accc
chairman
rod
sims
said
in
a
statement
earlier
on
thursday
aurizon
said
in
august
last
year
that
it
had
decided
to
quit
the
freight
business
selling
two
units
for
a
million
million
and
closing
a
third
arm
allowing
it
to
focus
on
coal
haulage
it
planned
to
sell
its
queensland
rail
and
road
freight
business
to
a
consortium
of
linfox
and
pacific
national
and
its
acacia
ridge
intermodal
rail
terminal
separately
to
pacific
national
the
company
said
on
thursday
that
the
regulator
s
statement
was
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
freight
business
could
be
sold
to
a
third
party
but
reiterated
that
was
not
the
case
as
well
as
a
loss
of
jobs
a
closure
of
the
business
would
also
be
likely
to
affect
rail
services
and
rail
line
haul
capacity
in
queensland
potentially
disrupting
freight
supply
chains
it
said
the
regulator
is
expected
to
make
a
final
decision
on
may
aurizon
shares
slipped
as
much
as

largely
recovering
in
a
slightly
weaker
overall
market
