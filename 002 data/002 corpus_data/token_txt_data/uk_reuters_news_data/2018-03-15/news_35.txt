a
nuclear
plant
project
in
southwest
england
has
made
good
progress
in
supply
chain
management
but
some
improvements
are
needed
before
construction
accelerates
an
inspection
has
found
britain
s
office
for
nuclear
regulation
onr
examined
the
supply
chain
arrangements
for
edf
energy
s
hinkley

c
project
in
light
of
falsification
issues
at
one
of
the
plant
s
key
suppliers
fromatome
s
creusot
forge
in
france
the
creusot
forge
foundry
stopped
production
last
year
following
the
discovery
of
manufacturing
flaws
and
the
falsification
of
manufacturing
tracking
documentation
inspectors
scrutinised
how
robust
the
site
licensee
nnb
genco
s
arrangements
are
for
ensuring
the
quality
of
hinkley
point
s
structures
systems
and
components
the
inspection
took
place
in
the
early
stages
of
construction
overall
onr
is
broadly
satisfied
with
the
enhanced
management
system
arrangements
at
areva
creusot
forge
it
said
in
a
report
the
inspection
team
concluded
that
areva
and
nnb
genco
had
made
good
progress
in
deploying
their
improvement
programme
and
had
enhanced
their
manufacturing
processes
management
system
arrangements
and
the
facility
s
nuclear
safety
and
quality
culture
it
added
however
the
inspection
was
rated
amber
meaning
some
arrangements
are
below
standard
and
improvements
need
to
be
made
for
example
evidence
was
not
provided
to
demonstrate
how
nnb
genco
had
learnt
from
the
failings
at
creusot
forge
and
communicated
to
contractors
nnb
genco
s
own
supply
chain
improvement
programme
needs
further
development
to
make
sure
it
is
prioritised
and
better
aligned
to
the
