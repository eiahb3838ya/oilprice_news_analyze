which
has
ambitions
to
transform
from
a
transit
country
for
russian
gas
to
an
energy
trading
centre
said
it
would
start
a
feasibility
study
on
creating
a
natural
gas
hub
at
the
black
sea
port
of
varna
sofia
s
plans
for
the
hub
are
backed
by
the
european
commission
they
followed
the
cancellation
in
of
russian
gazprom
s
south
stream
gas
pipeline
project
which
would
have
shipped
russian
gas
under
the
black

bulgartransgaz
signed
a
million
levs

the
bulgarian
energy
ministry
said
in
a
statement
the
european
union
has
also
committed
to
provide
euros
for
the
feasibility
study
the
cancellation
of
south
stream
was
a
blow
to
bulgaria
which
relies
almost
exclusively
on
russian
gas
and
sofia
hopes
the
balkan
gas
hub
project
would
keep
russian
gas
flowing
through
its
territory
on
its
way
to
central
europe
european
commission
vice
president
maros
sefcovic
reiterated
brussels
support
for
the
plan
which
will
help
boost
gas
liquidity
and
energy
security
in
the
southeastern
europe
we
in
the
european
commission
very
much
support
the
plans
of
bulgaria
to
be
transformed
from
a
transit
country
into
a
gas
trading
country
sefcovic
told
reporters
at
an
energy
forum
in
sofia
we
want
the
balkan
gas
hub
to
be
efficient
to
be
the
hub
where
the
gas
supplies
are
coming
from
different
directions
but
the
gas
should
be
traded
here
should
be
sold
to
the
partner
and
shouldn
t
be
just
rushed
through
the
territory
to
other
countries
he
said
at
present
bulgaria
transports
about
billion
cubic
metres
of
russian
gas
to
turkey
a
year
but
these
shipments
may
stop
in
if
russia
delivers
on
its
plan
to
complete
turkstream
pipeline
bulgaria
also
hopes
to
attract
azeri
natural
gas
as
well
as
lng
supplies
from
greece
qatar
and
elsewhere
the
cost
of
building
a
hub
is
estimated
at
between
billion
euros
billion
and
billion
euros
billion
it
would
use
existing
and
new
pipelines
in
bulgaria
as
well
as
interconnector
links
it
is
building
with
romania
serbia
and
turkey
and
eventually
an
undersea
pipeline
from
russia
russia
has
made
no
commitments
to
provide
gas
for
bulgaria
s
hub
project
and
its
scope
would
be
limited
it
if
failed
to
attract
any
gas
from
russia
moscow
has
said
it
would
consider
the
hub
only
if
it
has
guarantees
that
the
project
would
not
run
counter
to
eu
