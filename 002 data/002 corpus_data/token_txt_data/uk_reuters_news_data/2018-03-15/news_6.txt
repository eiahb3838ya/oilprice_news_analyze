reuters
the
dutch
shipping
company
seatrade
and
two
of
its
directors
were
found
guilty
by
a
dutch
court
on
thursday
of
illegally
sailing
ships
to
india
to
have
them
demolished
the
first
criminal
case
of
its
kind
in
the
netherlands
the
company
and
the
directors
were
fined
up
to
euros
the
directors
were
also
banned
from
executive
roles
at
any
shipping
company
for
a
year
they
did
escape
the
prison
sentences
prosecutors
had
asked
for
the
court
said
seatrade
had
violated
european
union
rules
by
sending
four
ships
to
india
for
demolition
in
the
ships
ultimately
ended
up
on
beaches
in
india
bangladesh
and
turkey
where
their
dismantling
polluted
the
environment
and
endangered
the
lives
of
the
workers
involved
it
is
common
knowledge
that
beaching
a
ship
and
demolishing
it
at
the
spot
pollutes
water
and
air
while
untrained
workers
lack
the
expertise
to
deal
with
dangerous
materials
the
court
said
these
practices
cause
multiple
deaths
each
with
demolition
as
their
only
destination
the
ships
were
waste
from
the
moment
they
left
port
at
rotterdam
and
hamburg
the
judges
concluded
their
journey
thereby
violated
rules
banning
the
transport
of
waste
from
the
eu
to
india
seatrade
said
it
was
disappointed
with
the
verdict
and
indicated
it
would
consider
an
appeal
there
is
surprise
and
disbelief
over
the
fines
and
professional
ban
of
two
directors
spokesman
cor
radings
said
in
a
statement
seatrade
would
like
to
stress
that
recycling
is
an
extremely
challenging
area
for
the
international
community
as
a
hundreds
of
ships
end
up
on
the
beaches
of
india
and
other
countries
in
the
region
each
year
they
are
demolished
by
untrained
workers
who
have
no
way
to
safely
deal
with
the
toxic
waste
the
ships
contain
like
bunker
fuels
acids
and
asbestos
rules
adopted
by
the
eu
in
mandate
that
ships
registered
in
the
eu
must
be
recycled
through
approved
facilities
but
the
rules
contain
loopholes
and
the
south
asian
yards
continue
to
dismantle
old
ships
activist
group
shipbreaking
platform
estimates
ships
were
broken
down
by
hand
on
beaches
in
india
pakistan
and
bangladesh
last
year
amounting
to
percent
of
all
tonnage
dismantled
globally
dutch
environmental
group
north
sea
foundation
welcomed
the
verdict
it
makes
sense
and
we
are
especially
happy
with
the
precedent
it
sets
not
only
in
the
netherlands
but
the
whole
of
europe
