oil
prices
were
stable
on
thursday
supported
by
healthy
global
demand
but
held
back
by
the
relentless
rise
in
production
that
is
undermining
efforts
led
by
producer
cartel
opec
to
cut
supplies
and
prop
up
markets

crude

were
at

up

prices
were
receiving
some
support
from
healthy
demand
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
said
on
wednesday
that
oil
consumption
was
expected
to
grow
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
but
looming
over
markets
has
been
a
relentless
climb
in
crude
output
which
hit
another
record
last
week
by
rising
to
million
bpd
up
by
more
than
percent
since
commercial
crude
inventories
were
up
by
million
barrels
at
million
barrels
crude
production
which
has
already
overtaken
that
of
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
is
expected
to
rise
above
million
bpd
later
this
year
taking
the
top
spot
from
russia
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
soaring
output
as
well
as
rising
output
in
canada
and
brazil
is
undermining
efforts
by
middle
east
dominated
opec
to
withhold
supplies
in
order
to
bolster
prices
opec
on
wednesday
raised
its
forecast
for
oil
supply
to
almost
double
the
growth
predicted
four
months
ago
the
group
said
producers
would
boost
supply
by
million
bpd
in
but
since
opec
expects
demand
this
year
to
grow
by
only
million
bpd
that
would
leave
the
market
slightly
oversupplied
and
may
require
more
or
longer
supply
restraint
opec
and
several
other
producers
led
by
russia
began
cutting
supply
in
january
to
erase
a
global
glut
of
crude
that
had
built
up
since
opec
said
its
combined
output
dropped
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
in
february
led
by
declines
in
iraq
the
united
arab
emirates
and
venezuela
these
cuts
and
rising
output
mean
that
opec
is
losing
market
share
in
demand
for
opec
crude
is
forecast
at
million
bpd
down
by
million
bpd
from
the
previous
assessment
and
million
bpd
lower
than
a
year
earlier
