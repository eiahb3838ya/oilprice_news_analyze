update 5-in a first, u.s. blames russia for cyber attacks on energy grid
washington
reuters
the
trump
administration
on
thursday
blamed
the
russian
government
for
a
campaign
of
cyber
attacks
stretching
back
at
least
two
years
that
targeted
the
power
grid
marking
the
first
time
the
united
states
has
publicly
accused
moscow
of
hacking
into
american
energy
infrastructure
beginning
in
march
or
possibly
earlier
russian
government
hackers
sought
to
penetrate
multiple
critical
infrastructure
sectors
including
energy
nuclear
commercial
facilities
water
aviation
and
manufacturing
according
to
a
security
alert
published
thursday
the
department
of
homeland
security
and
fbi
said
in
the
alert
that
a
intrusion
campaign
by
russian
government
cyber
actors
had
targeted
the
networks
of
small
commercial
facilities
where
they
staged
malware
conducted
spear
phishing
and
gained
remote
access
into
energy
sector
the
alert
did
not
name
facilities
or
companies
targeted
the
direct
condemnation
of
moscow
represented
an
escalation
in
the
trump
administration
s
attempts
to
deter
russia
s
aggression
in
cyberspace
after
senior
intelligence
officials
said
in
recent
weeks
the
kremlin
believes
it
can
launch
hacking
operations
against
the
west
with
impunity
it
coincided
with
a
decision
thursday
by
the
treasury
department
to
impose
sanctions
on
russian
people
and
five
groups
including
moscow
s
intelligence
services
for
meddling
in
the
presidential
election
and
other
malicious
cyber
attacks
russia
in
the
past
has
denied
it
has
tried
to
hack
into
other
countries
infrastructure
and
vowed
on
thursday
to
retaliate
for
the
new
sanctions
security
officials
have
long
warned
that
the
united
states
may
be
vulnerable
to
debilitating
cyber
attacks
from
hostile
adversaries
it
was
not
clear
what
impact
the
attacks
had
on
the
firms
that
were
targeted
but
thursday
s
alert
provided
a
link
to
an
analysis
by
the
cyber
security
firm
symantec
last
fall
that
said
a
group
it
had
dubbed
dragonfly
had
targeted
energy
companies
in
the
united
states
and
europe
and
in
some
cases
broke
into
the
core
systems
that
control
the
companies
operations
malicious
email
campaigns
dating
back
to
late
were
used
to
gain
entry
into
organizations
in
the
united
states
turkey
and
switzerland
and
likely
other
countries
symantec
said
at
the
time
though
it
did
not
name
russia
as
the
culprit
the
decision
by
the
united
states
to
publicly
attribute
hacking
attempts
of
american
critical
infrastructure
was
unprecedented
and
extraordinary
said
amit
yoran
a
former
official
who
founded
dhs
s
computer
emergency
response
team
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
this
said
yoran
now
chief
executive
of
the
cyber
firm
tenable
said
a
white
house
national
security
council
spokesman
did
not
respond
when
asked
what
specifically
prompted
the
public
blaming
of
russia
officials
have
historically
been
reluctant
to
call
out
such
activity
in
part
because
the
united
states
also
spies
on
infrastructure
in
other
parts
of
the
world
news
of
the
hacking
campaign
targeting
power
companies
first
surfaced
in
june
in
a
confidential
alert
to
industry
that
described
attacks
on
industrial
firms
including
nuclear
plants
but
did
not
attribute
blame
people
sort
of
suspected
russia
was
behind
it
but
today
s
statement
from
the
government
carries
a
lot
of
weight
said
ben
read
manager
for
cyber
espionage
analysis
with
cyber
security
company
fireeye
inc
the
campaign
targeted
engineers
and
technical
staff
with
access
to
industrial
controls
suggesting
the
hackers
were
interested
in
disrupting
operations
though
fireeye
has
seen
no
evidence
that
they
actually
took
that
step
read
said
a
former
senior
dhs
official
familiar
with
the
government
response
to
the
campaign
said
that
russia
s
targeting
of
infrastructure
networks
dropped
off
after
the
publication
in
the
fall
of
symantec
s
research
and
an
october
government
alert
which
detailed
technical
forensics
about
the
hacking
attempts
but
did
not
name
russia
the
official
declined
to
say
whether
the
campaign
was
still
ongoing
or
provide
specifics
on
which
targets
were
breached
or
how
close
hackers
may
have
gotten
to
operational
control
systems
we
did
not
see
them
cross
into
the
control
networks
dhs
cyber
security
official
rick
driggers
told
reporters
at
a
dinner
on
thursday
evening
driggers
said
he
was
unaware
of
any
cases
of
control
networks
being
compromised
in
the
united
states
and
that
the
breaches
were
limited
to
business
networks
but
he
added
we
know
that
there
is
intent
it
was
not
clear
what
russia
s
motive
was
many
cyber
security
experts
and
former
officials
say
such
behaviour
is
generally
with
the
potential
if
needed
for
sabotage
russia
has
shown
a
willingness
to
leverage
access
into
energy
networks
for
damaging
effect
in
the
past
hackers
were
widely
blamed
for
two
attacks
on
the
ukrainian
energy
grid
in
and
that
caused
temporary
blackouts
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
customers
and
were
considered
assaults
senator
maria
cantwell
the
top
democrat
on
the
senate
energy
and
natural
resources
committee
asked
the
trump
administration
earlier
this
month
to
provide
a
threat
assessment
gauging
russian
capabilities
to
breach
the
electric
grid
it
was
the
third
time
cantwell
and
other
senators
had
asked
for
such
a
review
the
administration
has
not
yet
responded
a
spokesman
for
cantwell
s
office
said
on
thursday
last
july
there
were
news
reports
that
the
wolf
creek
nuclear
operating
corp
which
operates
a
nuclear
plant
in
kansas
had
been
targeted
by
hackers
from
an
unknown
origin
spokeswoman
jenny
hageman
declined
to
say
at
the
time
if
the
plant
had
been
hacked
but
said
that
there
had
been
no
operational
impact
to
the
plant
because
operational
computer
systems
were
separate
from
the
corporate
network
hageman
on
thursday
said
the
company
does
not
comment
on
security
matters
john
keeley
a
spokesman
for
the
industry
group
the
nuclear
energy
institute
said
there
has
been
no
successful
cyber
attack
against
any
nuclear
facility
including
wolf
