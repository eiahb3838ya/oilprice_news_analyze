at

plants
from

according
to
more
than
a
dozen
interviews
with
plant
operators
and
industry
experts
the
shutdowns
which
follow
a
recent
ge
turbine
blade
failure
in
texas
come
as
ge
grapples
with
financial
losses
and
a
drop
in

massive

how

the

the

saying
that

its

needing

repairs
includes
four
turbines
in

that
were
shut
after

the

now
running

exelon
said
ge
told
reuters
it
identified
the
oxidation
problem
in

developed
a
fix
before
the

in

the
fix
uses

ge
has
been
transparent

responsive
in

pleased

a

at

which
is
receiving
replacement
blades
for
three
new

turbines
at
a
pennsylvania
plant
that

not
yet

following
the
problems
in

utility
electricite
de

closed
its
plant
in
the
northern
french
town
of
bouchain
for
a
month
starting
in
late
september
for
blade
replacements
bouchain
was
the
first
plant
worldwide
to
install
ge
s
turbine
bouchain
has
logged
outages
for
equipment
failure
testing
or
other
reasons
from
january
to
october
five
times
the
average
for

according
to
data
from
french
grid
operator
rte
analyzed
by

reuters
excluded
outages
for
planned
maintenance
the
french
data
also
show
that
plants
with
ge
turbines
have
closed
for
repairs
or
testing
on
average
more
than
twice
as
often
as
plants
in
france
with

made
by
alstom

spa
ge
acquired
alstom
s

business

ge
and
edf
officials
told
reuters
that
the
data
from
grid
operator
rte
an
independent
subsidiary
of
edf
are
not
wrong
but
should
not
be
used
to
assess
turbine
performance
because
some
outages
might
be
due
to
other
equipment
at
the
plants
edf
said
there
are
no
problems
at
bouchain
which
opened
in
and
that
frequent
shutdowns
are
not
unusual
for
new
plants
during
their
period
edf
said
bouchain
s
output
is
cycled
up
and
down
to
meet
peaks
in
electricity
demand
rather
than
running
constantly
the
other
plants
tracked
by
rte
also
can
be
used
for
peaking
and
have
been
in
operation
for
many
years
rte
siemens

reuters
could
not
obtain
comparable
data
on
how
often
ge
s
turbines
shut
down
for
repair
at
utilities
around
the
world
shutdowns
are
triggered
when
utilities
determine
that
a
plant
needs
to
be
serviced
or
tested
or
when
equipment
failure
or
other
problems
cause
the
plant
to
shut
down
unexpectedly
while
ge

still
produce
a

according
to
a

by

a

said
it
booked
seven
ha
turbine
orders
in
the
first
nine
months
of
this
year
half
as
many
as
in
the
same
period
last
year
ge
s
ha
turbines
have
come
under
particular
pressure
and
its
plant
repair
business
is
facing
growing
competition
the
success
of
ge
s
new
turbines
are
of
increasing
importance
as
it
slims
down
to
focus
on
power
plants
jet
engines
and
wind
turbines
in
a
flurry
of
restructuring
ge
spent
more
than
two
decades
developing
the
machines
but
brought
them
to
market
after
rivals
siemens
and
mitsubishi
were
gaining
market
share
forcing
ge
to
catch
up
ge

its

prices
by
about

this

now
chief

is
battling
to
restore

after
the

lost

mostly
from
its

unit
and
its

fell
to

three
notches
above

culp

its

to
cut

and

at
a
low
forcing
ge
and
rivals
to
fight
hard
for
fewer

buy
more

become

scott

the

said
in

that

no
