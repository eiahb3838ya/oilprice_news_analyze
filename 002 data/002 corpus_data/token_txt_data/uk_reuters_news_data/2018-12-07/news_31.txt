estimated
cnpc
will
load
at
least
two
million
barrels
a
month
from

doubling
previous
levels
to
help
compensate
for
cuts
made
before
sanctions

oil
exports
went
into
effect
on
nov
before
the

said
also
asking

we
continued
lifting
iranian

in
november
because
we
received
the
waiver
the

said
sinopec
