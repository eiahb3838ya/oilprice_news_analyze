the

investors
are
increasingly
anxious
about

they
are
focusing
more
on
the
timing

next
global
downturn
and
the
various
stresses
this
could
expose
wrote
hsbc
economist
james
pomeroy
in
a
note
but
for
all
of
the
volatility
in
the
equity
credit
and
oil
markets
most
of
the
global
economic
data
have
stayed
relatively
sanguine
us

robust

optimism

openings

pace

the
mood
in

brightened
a
little
after
the
wall
street
journal
reported
fed
officials
were
considering
whether
to
signal
a
new
mentality
after
a
likely
rate
increase
at
their
meeting
in
december
that
only
added
to
recent
speculation
that
the
central
bank
was
almost
done
hiking
rates
given
concerns
about
global
growth
and
the
disinflationary
impact
of
collapsing

prices

investors
also
steamrolled
the
yield
curve
to
its
flattest
in
over
a
decade
a
trend
that
has
historically
presaged
economic
slowdowns
and
even
recessions
the
sort
of
flattening
of
the
yield
curve
that
we
have
seen
recently
usually
indicates
that
investors
think
the
fed
is
nearing
the
end
of
a
tightening
cycle
and
that
rate
cuts
may
even
be
on
the
horizon
