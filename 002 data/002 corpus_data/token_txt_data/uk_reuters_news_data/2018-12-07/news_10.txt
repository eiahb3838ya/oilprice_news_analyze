exclusive-ge's push to fix power turbine problem goes global

reuters
utilities
are
shutting
down
at
least
of
general
electric
co
s
newest
gas
turbines
for
repairs
at
power
plants
from
taiwan
to
france
according
to
more
than
a
dozen
interviews
with
plant
operators
and
industry
experts
the
shutdowns
which
follow
a
recent
ge
turbine
blade
failure
in
texas
come
as
ge
grapples
with
financial
losses
and
a
drop
in
orders
for
the
massive
generators
that
can
supply
electricity
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
homes
ge

setting
aside
million
to
repair
its
and
model
turbines
as
it
restructures
its
power
business
the
conglomerate
has
declined
to
say
how
many
have
been
shut
down
or
when
it
would
replace
parts
if
needed
in
as
many
as
such
turbines
it
has
produced
power
plant
operators
in
japan
taiwan
france
and
at
multiple
sites
have
shut
down
or
plan
to
shut
down
at
least
of
the
new

ge

ceo
chuck
nugent
played
down
the
significance
of
turbine
shutdowns
and
the
french
data
saying
that
ge
turbines
are
performing
extremely
well
despite
the
need
for
early
maintenance
to
fix
the
blades
considering
all
of
the

has
in
use
ge

the
most
reliable
fleet
in
the
world
percent
give
or
take
reliability
he
added
ge
previously
disclosed
that
its
equipment
needing
blade
repairs
includes
four
turbines
in
texas
that
were
shut
after
oxidation
caused
a
blade
to
fail
in
one
of
them
in
september
those
turbines
are
included
in
the
being
shut
down
photographs

the
damaged
turbine
reviewed

show
dozens
of
jagged
and
broken
blades
inside
the
massive
machine
owned
by
exelon
corp
the
turbines
are
now
running
after
two
months
of
repairs
exelon
said
ge
told
reuters
it
identified
the
oxidation
problem
in
and
developed
a
fix
before
the
failure
in
texas
the
fix
uses
an
earlier
casting
method
that
was
employed
on
other
turbine
models

authority
told
reuters
ge
has
been
transparent
and
responsive
in
installing
new
blades
for
free
under
warranty
overall
we
ve
been
very
pleased
with
ge
s
ha
technology
and
its
performance
capabilities
said
beth
conley
a
spokeswoman
at
invenergy
which
is
receiving
replacement
blades
for
three
new
ha
turbines
at
a
pennsylvania
plant
that
has
not
yet
opened
following
the
problems
in
texas
utility
electricite
de
france
closed
its
plant
in
the
northern
french
town
of
bouchain
for
a
month
starting
in
late
september
for
blade
replacements
bouchain
was
the
first
plant
worldwide
to
install
ge
s
turbine
bouchain
has
logged
outages
for
equipment
failure
testing
or
other
reasons
from
january
to
october
five
times
the
average
for
plants
according
to
data
from
french
grid
operator
rte
analysed
by
reuters
reuters
excluded
outages
for
planned
maintenance
the
french
data
also
show
that
plants
with
ge
turbines
have
closed
for
repairs
or
testing
on
average
more
than
twice
as
often
as
plants
in
france
with
turbines
made
by
alstom
siemens
ag
and
ansaldo
energia
spa
ge
acquired
alstom
s
power
business
in
for
a
graphic
click
ge
and
edf
officials
told
reuters
that
the
data
from
grid
operator
rte
an
independent
subsidiary
of
edf
are
not
wrong
but
should
not
be
used
to
assess
turbine
performance
because
some
outages
might
be
due
to
other
equipment
at
the
plants
edf
said
there
are
no
problems
at
bouchain
which
opened
in
and
that
frequent
shutdowns
are
not
unusual
for
new
plants
during
their
period
edf
said
bouchain
s
output
is
cycled
up
and
down
to
meet
peaks
in
electricity
demand
rather
than
running
constantly
the
other
plants
tracked
by
rte
also
can
be
used
for
peaking
and
have
been
in
operation
for
many
years
rte
siemens
ag
ansaldo
energia
spa
and
mitsubishi
hitachi
power
systems
declined
to
comment
reuters
could
not
obtain
comparable
data
on
how
often
ge
s
turbines
shut
down
for
repair
at
utilities
around
the
world
shutdowns
are
triggered
when
utilities
determine
that
a
plant
needs
to
be
serviced
or
tested
or
when
equipment
failure
or
other
problems
cause
the
plant
to
shut
down
unexpectedly
while
ge
plants
still
produce
a
third
of
the
world
s
electricity
ge
fell
from
first
to
third
place
in
new
turbine
orders
by
capacity
behind
mitsubishi
and
siemens
according
to
a
tally
by
mccoy
power
reports
a
widely
watched
industry
data
source
ge
said
its
market
share
was
percent
in
the
third
quarter
according
to
mccoy
ge
said
it
booked
seven
ha
turbine
orders
in
the
first
nine
months
of
this
year
half
as
many
as
in
the
same
period
last
year
ge
s
ha
turbines
have
come
under
particular
pressure
and
its
plant
repair
business
is
facing
growing
competition
the
success
of
ge
s
new
turbines
are
of
increasing
importance
as
it
slims
down
to
focus
on
power
plants
jet
engines
and
wind
turbines
in
a
flurry
of
restructuring
ge
spent
more
than
two
decades
developing
the
machines
but
brought
them
to
market
after
rivals
siemens
and
mitsubishi
were
gaining
market
share
forcing
ge
to
catch
up
ge
undercut
its
rivals
prices
by
about
percent
to
go
from
percent
to
about
percent
share
of
this
turbine
class

stanley
analysts
said
in
a
report
this
year
now
chief
executive
officer
larry
culp
is
battling
to
restore
ge
s
profit
and
slash
debt
after
the
company
lost
billion
last
quarter
mostly
from
its
power
unit
and
its
credit
rating
fell
to
just
three
notches
above
junk
culp
is
splitting
up
the
power
division
consolidating
its
power
headquarters
to
cut
costs
and
has
named
new
leaders
for
it
demand
for
large
gas
turbines
is
at
a
low
forcing
ge
and
rivals
to
fight
hard
for
fewer
deals
as
utilities
buy
more
wind
and
solar
systems
that
have
become
cost
competitive
scott
strazik
the
new
chief
executive
of
ge
gas
power
said
in
an
interview
that
customers
are
happy
with
ge
s
response
to
the
blade
issue
and
ge
has
no
plans
to
change
how
it
handles
customer
issues
or
how
it
tests

noting
ge

test
facility

the
largest

most
comprehensive
in
