vienna
reuters
opec
and
its
allies
agreed
on
friday
to
slash
oil
production
by
more
than
the
market
had
expected
despite
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
reduce
the
price
of
crude
the
producer
club
will
curb
output
from
january
by
million
barrels
per
day
versus
october
levels
while
allies
contribute
an
additional
million
bpd
of
cuts
in
a
move
to
be
reviewed
at
a
meeting
in
april
oil
prices
jumped
about
percent
to
more
than
a
barrel
as
the
combined
cut
of
million
bpd
was
larger
than
the
minimum
million
bpd
that
the
market
had
expected
saudi
arabia
de
facto
leader
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
has
faced
demands
from
trump
to
help
the
global
economy
by
refraining
from
paring
supplies
an
output
curtailment
also
would
provide
support
to
iran
by
increasing
the
price
of
oil
amid
attempts
by
washington
to
squeeze
the
economy
of
opec
s
producer
asked
whether
the
decision
to
cut
could
sour
riyadh
s
relations
with
washington
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
told
reporters
the
kingdom
was
ready
to
pump
more
should
a
major
supply
outage
occur
we
will
not
squeeze
consumers
beyond
what
they
can
afford
he
said
adding
that
given
the
united
states
had
recently
become
the
biggest
nation
its
energy
companies
were
breathing
a
sigh
of
relief
further
complicating
riyadh
s
decisions
this
week
was
the
crisis
around
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
in
october
trump
has
backed
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
despite
calls
from
many
politicians
to
impose
stiff
sanctions
on
the
kingdom
falih
refrained
from
answering
a
question
on
whether
the
opec
decision
might
prompt
washington
to
withdraw
support
but
said
relations
were
based
on
shared
values
marathon
the
opec
deal
had
hung
in
the
balance
for
two
days
first
on
fears
that
russia
would
cut
too
little
and
later
on
concerns
that
iran
whose
crude
exports
have
been
depleted
by
sanctions
would
receive
no
exemption
and
block
the
agreement
but
after
hours
of
talks
iran
gave
opec
the
green
light
and
russia
said
it
was
ready
to
cut
more
russia
gave
a
commitment
to
reduce
output
by
bpd
from
october
levels
of
million
bpd
though
it
said
the
cuts
would
be
gradual
and
take
place
over
several
months
the
country
s
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
russian
president
vladimir
putin
had
discussed
an
output
decrease
with
saudi
prince
mohammed
iraq
opec
s
producer
pledged
to
cut
bpd
falih
said
saudi
production
had
dropped
to
million
bpd
in
december
from
million
in
november
and
was
set
to
decline
to
million
bpd
in
january
iran
libya
and
venezuela
were
effectively
given
exemptions
nigeria
which
has
been
exempt
since
the
previous
round
of
cuts
from
january
agreed
to
participate
helima
croft
managing
director
at
rbc
capital
markets
said
the
deal
exceeded
expectations
having
the
next
meeting
in
april
will
be
important
for
planning
purposes
to
speed
the
cycle
up
a
bit
she
said
opec
normally
meets
once
every
six
months
we
don
t
know
what
will
iran
s
sanctions
picture
look
like
we
don
t
know
the
iranian
volumes
which
will
be
coming
off
the
market
croft
said
but
bob
mcnally
president
of
rapidan
energy
group
said
the
details
of
the
cut
were
fuzzy
and
would
likely
result
in
a
lesser
reduction
than
the
headline
figure
president
trump
will
not
be
happy
to
see
today
s
headlines
but
how
strongly
he
reacts
depends
mainly
on
whether
crude
prices
rise
strongly
as
a
result
in
coming
days
and
special
representative
for
iran
brian
hook
met
falih
in
vienna
this
week
in
an
unprecedented
development
ahead
of
an
opec
meeting
saudi
arabia
first
denied
the
discussion
took
place
but
later
confirmed
it
political
pressure
is
clearly
a
dominant
factor
at
this
opec
meeting
limiting
the
scope
of
saudi
actions
to
rebalance
the
market
said
gary
ross
chief
executive
of
black
gold
investors
and
a
veteran
opec
watcher
the
price
of
crude
has
fallen
almost
a
third
since
october
as
saudi
arabia
russia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
raised
output
to
offset
lower
exports
from
iran
russia
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
states
have
been
vying
for
the
position
of
top
crude
producer
in
recent
years
the
united
states
is
not
part
of
any
initiative
due
to
its
legislation
and
fragmented
oil
industry
on
thursday
government
figures
showed
the
country
had
become
a
net
exporter
of
crude
oil
and
refined
products
for
the
first
time
on
record
underscoring
how
the
surge
in
production
has
altered
the
supply
equation
in
world
markets
