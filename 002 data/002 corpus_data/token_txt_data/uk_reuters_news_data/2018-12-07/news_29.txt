corrected-analysis-asia oil and lng markets are both swamped, so why are prices poles apart?
singapore

asian
markets
for
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
and
oil
are
closely
related
and
both
now
awash
in
oversupply
but
while
data
shows
forward
oil
prices
rising
lng
prices
for
future
delivery
are
veering
in
the
opposite
direction
this
makes
it
unprofitable
for
the
lng
market
to
store
excess
gas
as
the
forward
curve
for
asian
lng
shows
prices
for
february
are
cents
below
january
s
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
that
means
the
market
is
in
what
s
called
backwardation
where
prices
for
future
delivery
are
lower
than
those
for
immediate
dispatch
that
has
baffled
many
traders
because
crude
oil
has
a
price
curve
pointing
the
other
way
into
what
markets
call
contango
when
immediate
prices
are
lower
than
those
in
the
future
traders
can
store
unwanted
oil
profitably
for
later
sale

oil
markets
moved
from
backwardation
in
october
into
contango
from
november
due
to
an
emerging
glut
lng
markets
are
also
clotted
with
several
tankers

fuel
sitting
off

see
although
oil
and
gas
markets
are
usually
closely
related
to
each
other
current
conditions
have
drawn
them
apart
the
current
lng
price
curve
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
weather
while
oil
is
mostly
used
in
asia
to
fuel
cars
trucks
ships
and
planes
a
lot
of
lng
is
used
in
power
stations
and
for
heating
lng
demand
tends
to
rise
during
the
northern
hemisphere
s
winter
season
with
the
icy
blasts
of
last
winter
in
mind
and
a
huge
programme
under
way
in
china
to
shift
millions
of
households
to
using
gas
for
heating
instead
of
coal
traders
prepared
for
this
winter
by
loading
up
on
lng
but
so
far
this
winter
real
cold
snaps
have
yet
to
show
up
thanks
to
an
el
nino
weather
pattern
gripping
north
asia
hence
the
lng
market
is
sitting
on
lots
of
unneeded
gas
and
system
could
get
even
more
clogged
once
demand
sinks
with
the
arrival
of
mild
spring
weather
next
year
for

forecast
see
even
if
the
outlook
was
for
a
tighter
market
and
forward
prices
were
higher
storing
lng
for
later
sale
rarely
happens
that
s
because
unlike
oil
which
can
be
stored
easily
on
tankers
keeping
lng
on
a
ship
is
necessary
in
asia
and
costly
it
must
be
chilled
to
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
what
s
more
lng
also
gradually
evaporates
when
stored
aboard
tankers
so
cargoes
steadily
lose
value
in
europe
excess
lng
is
and
put
into
vast
underground
storage
facilities
but
asia
has
far
fewer
sites
for
this
forcing
traders
to
keep
the
current
excess
lng
on
ships
at
a
princely
charter
rate
of
a
day
