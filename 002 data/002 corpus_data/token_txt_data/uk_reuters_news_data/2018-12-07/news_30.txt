was

by

of

huawei
in

the
arrest
coming
on
the
heels
of
a
trade
truce
between
the
united
states
and
china
triggered
fears
that
the

could
escalate
further
and
dented
hopes
for
a
resolution

on
the
most
recent
yield
curve
developments
analysts
at
credit
suisse
wrote
noting
the
inversion
of
the
spread
between
and
yields
yet
we
believe
that
the
risks
of
a
downturn
are
very
limited
considering
how
strong
labor
markets
are
in
most
economies
we
therefore
think
that
risk
assets
should
rebound
and
regard
the
yield
curve
developments
essentially
as
a
reflection
of
a
more
neutral
federal
reserve
going
the
mood
in
markets
brightened
a
little
after
the
wall
street
journal
reported
fed
officials
were
considering
whether
to
signal
a
new
mentality
after
a
likely
rate
increase
at
their
meeting
in
december
that
only
added
to
recent
feverish
speculation
that
the
central
bank
was
almost
done
hiking
rates
given
concerns
about
global
growth
and
the
disinflationary
impact
of
collapsing
oil
prices
interest
rate
futures
rallied
hard
in
massive
volumes
with
the
market
now
pricing
in
less
than
one
hike
next
year
a
month
ago
they
had
been
betting
on
three
increases
the

helped

stage
on

investors
also
steamrolled
the
yield
curve
to
its
flattest
in
over
a
decade
a
trend
that
has
historically
presaged
economic
slowdowns
and
even
recessions
the
sort
of
flattening
of
the
yield
curve
that
we
have
seen
recently
usually
indicates
that
investors
think
the
fed
is
nearing
the
end
of
a
tightening
cycle
and
that
rate
cuts
may
even
be
on
the
horizon
