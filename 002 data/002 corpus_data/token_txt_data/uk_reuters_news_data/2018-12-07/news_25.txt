talks
billed
as
the
most
important
conference
since
the
paris
deal
on
climate
change
are
nearing
the
end
of
a
first
week
in
the
polish
city
of
katowice
the
capital
of
the
silesian
mining

the
aim
is
to
make
an
deadline
for
agreeing
a
rule
book
on
how
to
enforce
global
action
to
limit
further
warming
of
the
planet
below
is
a
flavour
of

around
the

nobel

prize
winner
william
nordhaus
has
called
on
countries
at
the
cop
conference
to
rethink
their
approach
to
fighting
climate
change
saying
voluntary
agreements
were
doomed
to
failure
limiting
global
warming
to
degrees
is
achievable
if
nations
agree
binding
targets
and
face
penalties
for
failing
to
meet
them
it
s
not
that
it
s
not
technologically
and
economically
feasible
it
s
that
we
don
t
have
the
political
will
and
consensus
to
do
it
nordhaus
told
reuters
correspondent
simon
johnson
in
stockholm
i
would
focus
on
a
carbon
price
say
to
a
tonne
and
then
countries
could
decide
how
they
wanted
to
do
that
they
could
do
cap
and
trade
they
could
do

carbon
negotiations
continue
to
clean
up
a
messy
text
ahead
of
saturday
s
deadline
to
have
a
document
ready
for
ministers
to
fight
over
in
the
second
and
final
week
of
the
conference
negotiators
say
there
has
been
progress
but
it
s
slow
and
as
ever
finance
is
a
big
stumbling
block
after
a
series
of
reports
documenting
the
widening
gap
between
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
action
to
reduce
them
michal
kurtyka
the
polish
leader
of
the
talks
said
this
had
given
rise
to
an
among
negotiators
before
a
day
off
on
sunday
and
the
arrival
of
ministers
on
monday
the
aim
is
to
cut
down
the
number
of
options
in
a
draft
of
about
pages
so
ministers
will
have
less
work
to
finalise
a
deal
the
joke
right
now
is
narrow
the
gap
he
said
the
latest
reports
show
continued
use
of
fossil
fuel
means
global
carbon
emissions
are
expected
to
rise
again
this
year
following
on
from
an
increase
in
carbon
dioxide
emissions
were
roughly
flat
from
which
inspired
hopes
that
emissions
had
peaked
in
while
the
talks
drag
on
behind
the
closed
doors
of
the
conference
centre
there
s
no
missing
the
sound
of
coal
rumbling
down
chutes
some
km
up
the
road
jsw
the
european
union
s
biggest
coking
coal
miner
has
plans
to
expand
possibly
with
chinese
money
and
says
coking
coal
used
in
steel
has
decades
of
rosy
future
ahead
