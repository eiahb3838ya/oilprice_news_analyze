london
reuters
investors
pulled
billions
from
bonds
and
stocks
this
week
as
bond
movements
triggered
fears
over
global
growth
and
a
trade
tussle
between
the
united
states
and
china
heated
up
strategists
at
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
said
on
friday
this
week
s
selloff
was
precipitated
by
the
inversion
of
part
of
the
yield
curve
which
has
previously
been
a
reliable
indicator
of
an
impending
recession
it
deepened
on
thursday
after
the
chief
financial
officer
of
china
s
huawei
was
arrested
on
a
request
sending
markets
spiraling
further
as
investors
predicted
a
worsening
of
relations
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
the
anxiety
drove
investors
to
pull
billion
from
equity
funds
and
billion
from
bond
funds
according
to
epfr
data
cited
by
baml
markets
starting
to
price
in
recession
but
policymakers
yet
to
price
in
recession
argued
the
baml
strategists
equity
outflows
were
made
up
of
opposite
flows
in
etfs
and
mutual
funds
with
billion
driven
into
etfs
while
billion
was
taken
out
of
mutual
funds
but
investors
were
continuing
to
edge
back
into
emerging
market
stocks
which
saw
their
eighth
week
of
inflows
with
billion
this
helped
push
baml
s
bull
bear
indicator
of
market
sentiment
up
from
to
not
yet
an
extreme
bearish
reading
baml
strategists
said
the
starting
point
for
a
fall
to
lower
equity
allocations
is
high
they
pointed
out
with
the
world
s
largest
sovereign
wealth
fund
at
percent
equity
allocations
hedge
funds
are
still
at
a
net
to
percent
net
long
and
baml
s
fund
manager
survey
shows
cash
levels
under
percent
the
global
consensus
forecast
is
for
percent
growth
in
in
which
the
strategists
said
was
too
high
predicting
a
big
low
in
markets
next
year
in
bond
flows
investors
were
pulling
out
of
corporate
debt
and
into
government
debt
the
epfr
data
showed
some
billion
flowed
into
government
bond
funds
over
the
past
eight
weeks
while
billion
flowed
out
of
and
emerging
market
debt
in
equity
sectors
a
building
preference
for
value
stocks
over
growth
inverted
this
week
as
tech
had
its
biggest
inflows
in
weeks
and
financials
saw
heavy
outflows
healthcare
tech
energy
and
real
estate
saw
inflows
while
consumer
stocks
utilities
and
materials
saw
outflows
financials
were
the
least
preferred
with
investors
pulling
billion
from
the
