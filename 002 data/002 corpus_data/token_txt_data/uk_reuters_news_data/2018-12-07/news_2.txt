on
friday
overshadowing
the
lift
from
higher
oil
prices
and
jobs
data
while
europe
was
higher
on
the
day
with
a
small
recovery
after
three
sessions
of
heavy
losses
the
trade
standoff
between
washington
and
beijing
was
still
a
major
lingering
worry
for
investors
volatility
is
high
and
investors
are
twitchy
it
has
been
a
dreadful
week
for
european
markets
and
today
s
positive
move
can
t
mask
the
previous
losses
said
david
madden
market

at
cmc
markets
uk
the
stoxx
index
rose
percent
while
an
index
of

s
largest

rose

by
declines
in

the

was
a
reversal
from
earlier
in
the
day
when
stocks
were
higher
on
labor
data
that
showed
employers
hired
fewer
workers
than
expected
in
november
that
supported
a
view
that
growth
is
moderating
and
the
federal
reserve
may
stop
raising
rates
sooner
than
previously
thought
payrolls
increased
by
last
month
but
missed
economists
expectation
for
a
rise
of
it
is
still
consistent
with
the
fed
raising
interest
rates
said
scott
brown
chief
economist
at
raymond
james
in
petersburg
florida
but
i
think
the
main
theme
here
is
that
investors
are
expecting
the
fed
to
be
even
more
gradual
a
little
bit
more
cautious
in
raising
interest
rates

big

of
the

the

as
an
added
threat
