h
emissions
from
buildings
and
construction
appear
to
have
peaked
at
a
global
level
the
united
nations
said
on
friday
a
trend
that
could
encourage
countries
to
take
up
the
issue
more
aggressively
as
a
way
of
curbing
climate
change
greenhouse
gas
emissions
attributed
to
buildings
levelled
off
over
but
still
represent
about
a
third
of
the
global
emissions
that
cause
climate
change
a
report
by
un
environment
and
its
partners
said
the
finding
is
a
rare
bright
spot
amid
a
spate
of
warnings
that
not
enough
is
being
done
to
stop
the
planet
heating
up
global
carbon
emissions
are
set
to
rise
nearly
percent
this
year
due
to
continued
fossil
fuel
use
scientists
said
this
week
dashing
hopes
that
an
increase
in
was
temporary
after
two
years
of
slowdown
the
un
environment
report
called
for
more
pledges
to
make
building
construction
greener
in
national
climate
action
plans
submitted
for
the
paris
agreement
to
curb
climate
change
it
s
a
very
complex
field
but
one
that
s
absolutely
critical
nick
nuttall
a
un
environment
spokesman
told
reporters
on
the
sidelines
of
climate
talks
in
poland
delegates
from
more
than
nations
party
to
the
paris
agreement
are
gathered
in
the
polish
city
of
katowice
to
meet
an
deadline
to
agree
rules
on
how
to
enforce
the
pact
the
rule
book
as
it
is
known
is
expected
to
include
details
about
how
countries
will
report
and
monitor
curbs
on
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
strengthen
their
national
plans
a
positive
outcome
at
the
negotiations
could
encourage
governments
to
double
down
on
promises
to
cut
emissions
from
the
construction
industry
said
nuttall
that
might
increase
the
enthusiasm
of
nations
to
revise
their
action
plans
he
said
if
they
re
revised
upwards
to
include
the
building
and
construction
sector
then
what
happens
here
will
have
a
very
strong
impact
on
the
sector
being
able
to
move
forward
to
encourage
buildings
the
national
plans
could
push
for
better
insulation
and
windows
by
aspiring
to
revamp
building
codes
and
set
up
energy
certification
schemes
they
could
also
plan
to
lower
emissions
from
common
building
materials
like
cement
and
steel
whose
manufacturing
generates
large
amounts
of
carbon
the
report
said
even
if
such
rules
require
consumers
to
open
their
wallets
to
retrofit
a
home
for
example
it
is
unlikely
to
cause
the
kind
of
public
anger
seen
recently
in
france
over
fuel
taxes
said
jennifer
layke
global
director
for
energy
with
the
world
resources
institute
higher
fuel
taxes
proposed
by
french
president
emmanuel
macron
to
fight
climate
change
have
stoked
violent
protests
in
the
european
nation
forcing
the
government
to
shelve
the
plan
this
week
if
you
told
everyone
they
had
to
spend
next
month
to
renovate
their
home
you
would
see
a
backlash
said
layke
but
most
countries
had
proven
strategies
to
help
consumers
shoulder
the
costs
such
as
financing
or
rebates
she
said
in
june
the
european
union
gave
its
member
states
months
to
put
into
law
a
goal
to
dramatically
increase
the
energy
efficiency
of
buildings
