gasoline
consumption
has
levelled
off
as
the
stimulus
provided
by
low
and
falling
oil
prices
between
and
has
faded
so
refiners
are
increasingly
turning
to
diesel
and
customers
in
emerging
markets
gasoline
consumption
is
forecast
to
rise
by
just
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
after
remaining
essentially
unchanged
last
year
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
slower
consumption
growth
stands
in
contrast
to
the
earlier
surge
when
usage
rose
by
almost
bpd
in
and
another
bpd

traffic
volumes
are
also
growing
more
slowly
after
rising
sharply
during
most
of
and
according
to
separate
estimates
from
the
federal
highway
administration
traffic
on
roads
was
up
by
less
than
percent
in
the
three
months
to
november

fhwa

traffic
growth
has
slowed
from
a
peak
of
well
over
percent
per
year
in
the
early
part
of
shortly
after
oil
prices
hit
their
lowest
point
in
the
current
cycle
oil
prices
have
been
trending
higher
for
more
than
two
years
and
are
now
within
per
barrel
of
their
average
real
level
over
the
entire
of
the
last
cycle
so
while
the
cost
of
fuel
is
not
expensive
it
is
no
longer
especially
cheap
and
the
steady
increase
in
prices
has
started
to
moderate
consumption
growth
the
nationwide
retail
price
of
gasoline
was
per
gallon
in
january
an
increase
of
more
than
cents
per
gallon
compared
with
two
years
previously
if
oil
prices
continue
to
climb
through
the
remainder
of
and
into
as
the
price
cycle
matures
gasoline
consumption
growth
will
likely
slow
even
further
after
two
years
in
when
the
motorists
provided
a
significant
boost
to
global
oil
demand
the
main
drivers
of
demand
growth
are
rotating
towards
diesel
and
the
emerging
economies
of
latin
america
africa
the
middle
east
and
asia
freight
volumes
are
rising
at
some
of
the
fastest
rates
this
decade
in
the
united
states
and
around
the
rest
of
the
world
since
almost
all
cargo
is
moved
by
engines
on
ships
trucks
and
railroads
that
use
diesel
fuel
freight
growth
is
providing
a
major
stimulus
for
diesel
consumption
in
geographical
terms
the
fastest
growth
in
consumption
will
come
from
outside
the
united
states
and
the
other
advanced
industrial
economies
developing
economies
accounted
for
most
of
the
growth
in
oil
consumption
between
and
but
were
hit
hard
by
the
slump
in
commodity
prices
during
and
the
economic
downturn
in
developing
countries
and
associated
slowdown
in
their
own
oil
demand
growth
was
one
of
the
factors
that
worsened
the
oil
price
slump
in
and
as
commodity
prices
rise
again
however
economic
growth
across
emerging
markets
is
accelerating
and
propelling
faster
increases
in
fuel
demand
and
adding
to
the
upward
pressure
on
oil
prices
refiners
exported
more
than
billion
barrels
of
finished
petroleum
products
in
the
first
months
of
an
increase
of
almost
percent
compared
with
the
same
period
in
finished
product
exports
have
accelerated
significantly
over
the
last
two
years
and
the
trend
is
set
to
continue
in
with
the
focus
for
demand
growth
shifting
from
gasoline
to
diesel
and
emerging
markets
fuel
exports
will
become
steadily
more
important
