this

slows
the
company
said
it
still
aims
to
boost
output
by
more
than
percent

its
shares
fell
almost
percent
after
it
released
its
outlook

galp
also
proposed
increasing
its
dividend

ebitda
of
billion

this

after
last

unlike
last

it
would
not
provide
a

which
it
last

galp
expects
to
increase

the

ebitda
rose
percent
in
the
quarter
and
percent
for
all
of
last

exceeding
galp
s
initial
guidance
for
of
up
to
billion
euros
galp
estimated
capital
expenditure
at
up
to
billion
euros
this
year
and
at
around
billion
euros
on
average
per
year
until
in
a
slight
shift
from
the
previous
outlook
which
put
it
in
range
of
billion
to
billion

guidance
seems
somewhat
disappointing
considering
the
expectations
for
savings
with
ongoing
efficiencies
in
brazil
bpi
analysts
said
in
a
note
but
ceo
carlos
gomes
da
silva
said
this
year
s
capex
included
two
refinery
stoppages
for
maintenance
an
increased
exposure
to
the
project
in
brazil
after
galp
raised
its
stake
there
to
percent
from

in
the
adjacent

works
alone
one
already
completed
in
a
days
at
the
sines
refinery
and
another
due
in
the
fourth
quarter
in
matosinhos
should
amount
to
up
to
million
euros
additional
expenditure
on
the
brazilian
projects
is
seen
at
more
than
million
we
will
be
very
selective
very
rigorous
in
terms
of
capex
always
sticking
to
our
target
of
percent
of
return
on
capital
employed
carlos
gomes
told
analysts
when
questioned
about
the
decision
to
raise
the
dividend
he
said
the
improved
performance
last
year
and
better
market
conditions
meant
that
we
are
almost
obliged
to
share
the
gains
with
shareholders
adding
that
galp
saw
the
potential
to
further
increase
dividends
in
the
future
the
company
plans
to
boost
output
to
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
by
most
of
galp
s
production
growth
will
come
from
brazil
where
it
has
stakes
in
large
offshore
oil
fields
and
continues
to
look
for
expansion
opportunities
from
onwards
it
plans
to
add
new
projects
in
mozambique
and
brazil
which
should
boost
the
share
of
natural
gas
output
to
up
to
percent
of
its
total
output
from
around
percent
now
galp
expects
free
cash
flow
of
over
billion
euros
by
up
from
million
last
year
and
said
it
should
break
even
at
oil
prices
around
a
barrel
shortly
after
down
from
a
price
of
in
its
previous
forecast
