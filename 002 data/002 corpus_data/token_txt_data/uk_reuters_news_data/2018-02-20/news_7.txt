reuters
a
virginia
state
court
judge
on
tuesday
rejected
a
request
by
the
unit
of
volkswagen
ag
to
delay
several
of
the
company
s
trials
over
excess
emissions
because
of
inflammatory
comments
made
by
a
lawyer
representing
car
owners
that
it
fears
will
prejudice
the
jury
fairfax
county
circuit
court
judge
bruce
white
said
after
a
hearing
that
he
would
proceed
with
a
trial
involving
a
north
carolina
man
who
bought
a
diesel
jetta
volkswagen
said
publicity
from
a
netflix
documentary
that
disclosed
the
company
had
jointly
sponsored
tests
that
exposed
monkeys
in
to
toxic
diesel
fumes
could
prejudice
its
chances
of
receiving
a
fair
trial
judge
white
said
he
was
satisfied
a
fair
panel
could
be
seated
for
the
expected
trial
the
jurors
don
t
know
much
about
these
cases
white
said
generally
of
cases
the
german
carmaker
is
being
sued
by
some
consumers
after
it
admitted
in
september
to
cheating
on
diesel
emissions
tests
sparking
the
biggest
business
crisis
in
its
history
nearly
all
owners
of
affected
cars
agreed
to
take
part
in
a
billion
settlement
in
in
the
united
states
that
addressed
claims
from
them
environmental
regulators
states
and
dealers
about
owners
however
opted
out
and
most
are
pursuing
court
claims
seeking
additional
compensation
volkswagen
of
america
had
asked
white
to
delay
that
trial
for
at
least
six
months
after
a
lawyer
for
more
than
vw
diesel
owners
michael
melkersen
gave
an
interview
in
the
netflix
documentary
in
which
he
referred
to
the
company
testing
diesel
fumes
on
monkeys
in
the
netflix
interview
melkersen
criticized
the
tests
adding
one
can
not
help
to
think
back
throughout
history
of
another
series
of
events
involving
individuals
being
gassed
by
a
person
who
was
actually
at
the
opening
of
the
very
first
volkswagen
factory
an
apparent
reference
to
nazi
leader
adolf
hitler
and
the
holocaust
in
its
legal
filing
vw
s
lawyers
argued
those
comments
would
prevent
a
fair
trial
volkswagen
lawyers
said
that
pretrial
publicity
has
connected
the
company
directly
with
hitler
and
the
holocaust
which
they
said
was
not
relevant
to
a
trial
about
claims
of
consumer
fraud
melkersen
previously
said
it
was
another
tactic
to
postpone
volkswagen
s
day
of
in
response
to
judge
white
s
ruling
a
vw
spokeswoman
said
the
company
looks
forward
to
demonstrating
at
the
upcoming
trial
that
the
plaintiff
has
suffered
no
damages
and
that
his
demands
for
compensation
are
extravagant
