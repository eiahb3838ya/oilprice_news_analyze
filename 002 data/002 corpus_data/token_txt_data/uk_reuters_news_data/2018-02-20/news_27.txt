reuters
norwegian
utility
statkraft
said
it
may
have
to
put
on
hold
some
planned
investments
if
the
tax
office
goes
ahead
with
a
billion
crown
million
claim
for
unaccounted
taxes
statkraft
said
previously
that
it
received
a
preliminary
claim
from
the
norwegian
tax
office
in
october
for
unpaid
taxes
relating
to
the
capital
structure
of
its
now
closed
belgian
unit
statkraft
treasury
centre
sa
stc
if
the
tax
office
formalises
the
claim
statkraft
would
have
to
pay
the
amount
immediately
meaning
it
would
lose
about
a
third
of
its
record
available
cash
earned
by
selling
all
its
offshore
wind
assets
statkraft
strongly
disagrees
that
there
is
a
legal
basis
for
any
reassessment
a
possible
tax
claim
could
affect
statkraft
s
future
financial
capacity
statkraft
spokesman
lars
magnus
gunther
said
on
tuesday
when
asked
about
the
possible
consequences
to
investments
of
the
tax
claim
there
is
no
formal
decision
yet
but
it
will
be
possible
to
take
it
to
court
if
necessary
he
added
the
utility
last
week
reported
record
high
cash
and
cash
equivalents
of
billion
crowns
as
of
the
end
of
its
fiscal
year
most
of
it
intended
to
fund
planned
investments
in
onshore
renewable
energy
projects
gunther
said
the
company
had
no
indication
of
when
the
tax
authorities
would
make
a
final
decision
and
had
not
made
any
relevant
provisions
in
its
balance
sheet
the
norwegian
tax
office
found
the
company
was
not
compliant
with
the
arm
s
length
principle
statkraft
said
its
annual
results
statement
the
tax
reassessment
regards
stc
s
income
tax
returns
for
the
fiscal
years
and
the
total
financial
exposure
until
is
seen
at
billion
norwegian
crowns
the
firm
calculated
norway
s
tax
authority
declined
to
comment
on
statkraft
s
case
speaking
generally
it
said
that
any
company
that
receives
a
tax
claim
has
to
pay
the
full
tax
immediately
such
claims
must
be
paid
immediately
irrespective
of
any
ongoing
appeals
litigation
etc
in
relation
to
the
tax
claim
astrid
dugstad
tveter
head
of
corporate
law
at
norway
s
tax
office
told
reuters
in
an
email
the
arm
s
length
principle
applies
to
transactions
between
related
parties
it
states
that
the
amount
charged
by
one
related
party
to
another
for
a
given
product
must
be
the
same
as
if
the
parties
were
not
related
said
tveter
failure
to
comply
with
this
principle
can
provide
a
basis
for
reassessment
