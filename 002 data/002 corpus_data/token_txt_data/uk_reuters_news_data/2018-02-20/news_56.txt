the

does
not
currently

but
its

are
depleting
and
the
country
has
been
developing
plans
for
import
terminals
for
years
ewc
s
terminal
on
pagbilao
island
in
quezon
province
if

this

mark
the

elliott
told
reuters
in
an
interview
in
manila
the
generating
capacity
is
part
of
a
mw
power
plant
ewc
is
building
in
quezon
located
near
its
lng
receiving
plant
that
is
percent
complete
and
will
be
capable
of
receiving
million
tonnes
of
lng
a
year
elliott
said
the
company
will
initially
source
the
gas
from
the
spot
market
and
later
possibly
from
its
sengkang
gas
field
in
indonesia
elliot
said
ewc
has
been
developing
the
power
plant
and
import
terminal
since
but
completion
has
been
set
back
by
several
delays
elliott
said
the
project
was
now
far
enough
advanced
for
ewc
to
have
a
tanker
on
in
singapore
to
bring
in
lng
once
the
facility
is
ready
in
a
sign
the
project
is
close
to
the
national
grid
corporation
of
the
philippines
ngcp
in
charge
of
running
the
country
s
power
grid
has
issued
a
system
impact
study
to
energy
world
that
details
how
the
plant
s
entry
would
affect
the
grid
and
is
one
of
many
requirements
before
power
stations
go
online
said
an
ngcp
spokeswoman
power
demand
in
the
philippines
is
rising
fast
along
with
its
expanding
economy
and
imports
of
lng
are
expected
to
rise
rapidly
as
the
nation
s
natural
gas
reserves
decline
the
philippines
plans
to
rely
on
imported
lng
when
its
malampaya
gas
field
in
western
philippine
waters
dries
up
in
the
field
fuels
around
a
fifth
of
the
country
s
power
to
meet
future
demand
elliott
said
ewc
was
in
early
talks
on
another
lng
receiving
site
in
southern
mindanao
island
the
government
is
already
looking
for
partners
to
invest
in
a
separate
billion
lng
facility
to
be
built
in
batangas
province
also
south
of
manila
where
many
of
the
current
power
stations
are
located
ewc
has
also
expressed
interest
to
invest
in
the
batangas
lng
project
elliott
is
looking
as
well
to
spin
off
its
quezon
lng
terminal
and
power
station
and
list
the
assets
on
the
philippine
stock
exchange
pse
the
stock
market
is
very
actively
talking
to
us
saying
they
d
like
us
to
be
listed
and
i
would
like
it
to
be
listed
i
would
prefer
the
end
of
this
year
but
probably
it
will
be
next
year
he
said
ewc
has
made
some
inquiries
and
the
exchange
is
waiting
for
it
to
take
any
listing
initiative
pse
chief
operating
officer
roel
refran
told
reuters
the
company
is
also
in
discussions
with
local
government
officials
for
a
lng
plant
to
be
built
in
sulu
province
in
southern
mindanao
island
though
the
project
is
in
early
stages
of
development
elliott
said
there
could
also
be
potential
for
the
philippines
to
find
new
domestic
gas
reserves
there
are
gas
wells
in
sulu
province
that
have
been
shut
in
by
earlier
explorers
looking
for
oil
elliott
said
there
s
gas
sitting
there
i
know
one
concession
holder
was
planning
to
sell
it
to
malaysia
but
that
would
look
stupid
wouldn
