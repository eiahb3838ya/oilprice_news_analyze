s
history
anthracite
is
helping
to
keep
the
lights
on
and
the
heating
going
this
winter
following
a
deal
that
has
also
helped
to
warm
kiev
s
relations
with
president
donald
trump
the
ukrainian
company
that
imported
the
coal
told
reuters
that
the
deal
made
commercial
sense
but
it
was
also
politically
expedient
according
to
a
person
involved
in
the
talks
on
the
agreement
and
power
industry
insiders
on
trump
s
side
it
provided
orders
for
a
region
of
the
united
states
which
was
a
vital
constituency
in
his
presidential
election
victory
on
the
ukrainian
side
the
deal
helped
to
win
favour
with
the
white
house
whose
support
kiev
needs
in
its
conflict
with
russia
as
well
as
opening
up
a
new
source
of
coal
at
a
time
when
its
traditional
supplies
are
disrupted
trump
s
campaign
call
to
improve
relations
with
the
kremlin
alarmed
the
leadership
in
ukraine
which
lost
crimea
to
russia
in
and
is
still
fighting
separatists
however
things
looked
up
when
president
petro
poroshenko
visited
the
white
house
on
june
last
year
the
meeting
with
trump
was
a
key
point
a
milestone
a
ukrainian
government
source
told
reuters
requesting
anonymity
the
americans
had
set
particular
store
by
supplying
coal
to
ukraine
i
felt
that
for
them
it
is
important
said
the
source
who
was
present
at
the
talks
that
also
included
a
session
with
vice
president
mike
pence
despite
trump
s
incentives
utilities
are
shutting
plants
and
shifting
to
gas
wind
and
solar
power
ailing
mining
companies
are
therefore
boosting
exports
to
asia
and
seeking
new
buyers
among
eastern
european
countries
trying
to
diversify
from
russian
supplies
trump
who
championed
coal
producers
on
the
campaign
trail
pressed
the
message
after
meeting
poroshenko
ukraine
already
tells
us
they
need
millions
and
millions
of
metric
tons
right
now
he
said
in
a
speech
nine
days
later
we
want
to
sell
it
to
them
and
to
everyone
else
all
over
the
globe
who
need
the
deal
with
kiev
was
sealed
the
following
month
after
which
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
said
as
promised
during
the
campaign
president
trump
is
unshackling
american
energy
with
each
day
on
the
the
deal
helped
to
bolster
a
key
strategic
partner
against
regional
pressures
that
seek
to
undermine
interests
ross
added
referring
to
past
russian
attempts
to
restrict
natural
gas
flows
to
its
western
neighbours
ukraine
was
once
a
major
producer
of
anthracite
a
coal
used
in
power
generation
but
it
has
faced
a
shortage
in
recent
winters
as
it
lost
control
of
almost
all
its
mines
in
eastern
areas
to
the
separatists
along
with
south
africa
mines
in
russia
have
been
the
main
source
of
anthracite
imports
but
this
is
fraught
with
uncertainty
in
the
past
moscow
has
cut
off
gas
supplies
to
the
country
over
disputes
with
kiev
while
the
ukrainian
government
considered
forbidding
anthracite
imports
from
russia
in
although
no
ban
has
yet
been
imposed
overall
anthracite
imports
shot
up
to
million
tonnes
in
the
first
months
of
from
just
million
in
all
of
the
year
before
the
rebellion
erupted
neighbouring
poland
which
trump
visited
in
july
is
also
turning
increasingly
to
coal
its
imports
from
the
united
states
jumped
last
year
to
tonnes
data
from
the
arp
agency
showed
in
july
ukrainian
energy
company
centrenergo
announced
the
deal
with
company
xcoal
for
the
supply
of
up
to
tonnes
of
anthracite
centrenergo
initially
said
it
would
pay
per
tonne
for
the
first
shipment
a
price
industry
experts
and
traders
told
reuters
was
expensive
compared
with
alternatives
however
chief
executive
oleg
kozemko
said
the
cost
varied
according
to
the
quality
of
the
coal
delivered
so
centrenergo
had
paid
around
per
tonne
on
average
for
the
tonnes
supplied
by
the
end
of
kozemko
said
in
an
interview
that
the
deal
was
centrenergo
s
only
viable
option
after
three
tenders
it
launched
earlier
last
year
had
failed
the
idea
to
sign
a
contract
with
xcoal
was
a
matter
of
necessity
he
said
we
had
agreements
but
they
didn
t
work
out
because
the
pricing
that
they
discussed
with
us
and
that
we
signed
an
agreement
on
didn
t
work
data
on
the
state
tenders
registry
and
documents
seen
by
reuters
show
that
two
of
the
tenders
failed
due
to
a
lack
of
bids
while
the
results
of
the
third
were
cancelled
if
that
contract
had
worked
out
centrenergo
would
have
paid
around
per
tonne
according
to
reuters
calculations
based
on
the
exchange
rate
at
the
time
of
the
tender
in
april
energy
expert
andriy
gerus
told
reuters
the
xcoal
deal
probably
helps
ukraine
to
build
some
good
political
connections
with
the
usa
and
that
is
quite
important
right
now
the
anthracite
for
centrenergo
is
mined
in
pennsylvania
which
backed
trump
in
this
marked
the
first
time
a
republican
presidential
candidate
had
won
the
state
since
and
followed
trump
s
pledge
to
reverse
the
coal
industry
s
history
of
plant
closures
and
in
recent
years
centrenergo
says
it
and
xcoal
agreed
the
contract
independently
of
their
governments
and
without
any
political
pressure
however
kozemko
said
if
talks
between
the
heads
of
our
countries
helped
in
this
then
we
can
only
say
thank
you
it
was
a
mutual
for
the
ukrainian
authorities
the
diplomatic
benefit
is
clear
when
the
first
shipment
of
anthracite
arrived
in
september
poroshenko
tweeted
a
photo
of
himself
shaking
hands
with
trump
in
washington
as
agreed
with
realdonaldtrump
first
american
coal
has
reached
ukraine
he
wrote
poroshenko
s
press
service
said
the
deal
is
an
exact
example
of
when
the
friendly
and
warm
atmosphere
of
one
conversation
helps
strengthen
the
foundations
of
a
strategic
partnership
in
the
interests
of
both
sides
for
the
future
the
washington
meeting
also
discussed
military
and
technical
cooperation
soon
after
the
trump
administration
said
it
was
considering
supplying
defensive
weapons
to
ukraine
to
counter
the
separatists
in
late
december
the
state
department
announced
that
the
provision
of
enhanced
defensive
capabilities
had
been
approved
kozemko
said
the
xcoal
deal
was
likely
to
be
only
the
beginning
of
centrenergo
s
trade
relations
with
the
united
states
as
it
is
currently
holding
talks
on
supplies
of
bituminous
coal
a
poorer
quality
variety
it
s
good
that
we
studied
the
market
because
we
had
never
looked
at
it
before
we
see
big
prospects
for
bituminous
coal
he
said
adding
that
other
ukrainian
firms
were
thinking
similarly
we
showed
how
to
bring
coal
from
america
and
they
