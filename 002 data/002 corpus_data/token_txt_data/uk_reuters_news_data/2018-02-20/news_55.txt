an
energy
task
force
advising
japan
s
foreign
minister
has
proposed
boosting
renewable
energy
and
shifting
away
from
and
nuclear
power
at
home
arguing
the
country
s
energy
policies
are
outdated
and
undermine
its
global
competitiveness
the
advice
comes
in
a
report
commissioned
by
minister
taro
kono
a
maverick
lawmaker
with
prime
ministerial
ambitions
and
echoes
his
own
convictions
pitting
him
against
japan
s
powerful
ministry
of
economy
trade
and
industry
meti
meti
urges
using
coal
at
home
and
financing
projects
abroad
the
task
force
report
presented
to
kono
on
monday
argues
nuclear
power
has
lost
economic
competitiveness
and
says
the
world
s
economy
should
cut
reliance
on
atomic
energy
to
as
little
as
possible
and
instead
boost
use
of
renewables
if
japan
focuses
on
renewable
energy
rooted
in
its
abundant
natural
resources
and
reduces
dependence
on
imported
fossil
fuels
and
uranium
this
will
contribute
to
its
energy
security
and
make
possible
a
new
domestic
economy
the
task
force
said
in
the
report
it
is
obvious
that
japan
is
the
report
comes
as
meti
also
a
proponent
of
nuclear
power
is
reviewing
the
country
s
energy
policy
meti
said
it
had
no
immediate
response
to
the
task
force
report
in
its
current
official
targets
japan
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
importers
of
thermal
coal
and
natural
gas
aims
for
renewables
to
make
up
to
percent
of
its
energy
mix
in
up
from
about
percent
now
kono
in
a
speech
in
abu
dhabi
last
month
called
that
target
lamentable
since
percent
is
the
global
average
now
the
son
of
a
former
foreign
minister
kono
has
made
no
secret
of
his
ambition
to
lead
the
country
at
some
point
and
has
long
been
critical
of
japan
s
nuclear
power
industry
japan
is
the
world
s
biggest
importer
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
and
the
importer
of
coal
used
for
power
generation
thermal
coal
imports
rose
to
a
record
last
year
while
those
of
lng
were
near
record
highs
as
the
fuels
filled
the
gap
in
power
generation
left
by
the
country
s
slow
restart
of
nuclear
power
plants
closed
after
the
fukushima
disaster
japanese
companies
are
planning
to
build
more
than
new
coal
plants
the
fukushima
crisis
has
also
spurred
a
push
into
renewables
mainly
solar
energy
but
renewable
power
only
accounted
for
percent
of
japan
s
electricity
supplies
in
october
last
year
renewable
energy
use
has
surged
around
the
world
in
recent
years
as
costs
have
come
down
meanwhile
the
japanese
government
will
next
month
submit
a
bill
to
parliament
to
make
it
easier
to
develop
offshore
wind
power
