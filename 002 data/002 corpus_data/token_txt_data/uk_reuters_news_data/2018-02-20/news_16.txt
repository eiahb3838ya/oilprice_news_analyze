prospects
for
the
offshore
oil
drilling
market
are
improving
but
profits
for
drillers
are
still
under
pressure
and
rates
will
not
rise
before
the
head
of
s
energy
business
said
oil
firms
have
seen
cash
flow
climb
in
a
high
since
a
slump
in
crude
prices
lifted
by
their
plans
and
a
crude
price
recovery
although
this
has
spurred
new
investment
it
has
yet
to
benefit
suppliers
such
as
maersk
which
sold
its
north
oil
and
gas
business
to
france
s
total
last
year
and
now
focuses
on
providing
transport
and
logistics
you
see
from
the
oil
companies
and
earnings
that
they
ve
performed
really
well
you
also
see
that
they
have
started
increasing
capital
expenditure
claus
hemmingsen
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
maersk
s
capital
markets
day
but
one
of
the
reasons
that
they
re
faring
better
is
also
because
they
ve
put
an
enormous
pressure
on
their
suppliers
the
ceo
of
the
energy
unit
said
adding
profitability
is
still
low
and
under
pressure
for
suppliers
hemmingsen
said
the
industry
could
see
a
small
uptick
in
business
this
year
with
increased
demand
for
rigs
for
shallow
waters
although
there
was
still
little
sign
of
a
boost
in
demand
for
deepwater
rigs
we
believe
the
market
in
will
still
be
under
pressure
he
said
i
think
day
rates
will
start
increasing
in
and
but
we
don
t
expect
the
offshore
services
market
to
come
back
to
the
level
before
the
oil
price
oil
prices
plunged
from
above
a
barrel
in
to
below
at
the
start
of
they
are
now
at
about
hemmingsen
said
maersk
was
still
seeking
a
buyer
or
partner
for
its
offshore
drilling
and
supply
service
unit
but
did
not
indicate
how
far
the
search
had
progressed
danish
business
daily
borsen
reported
in
january
that
maersk
might
be
looking
to
peers
norwegian
peers
aker
odfjell
drilling
and
borr
drilling
to
sell
the
unit
hemmingsen
