analysis-kazakhstan's frozen billions sound alarm for sovereign funds
london
reuters
when
a
belgian
court
ordered
a
bank
to
freeze
billion
billion
pounds
of
assets
held
in
trust
for
a
kazakhstan
sovereign
wealth
fund
swf
it
set
a
worrying
precedent
for
other
swfs
the
case
is
one
of
several
brought
to
courts
in
europe
by
moldovan
businessman
anatolie
stati
who
is
attempting
to
force
the
kazakh
government
to
pay
up
in
a
dispute
about
his
energy
investments
in
the
country
court
rulings
imposing
asset
freezes
in
belgium
the
netherlands
sweden
and
luxembourg
are
significant
because
they
address
the
issue
of
whether
swfs
should
be
treated
as
investment
arms
of
governments
or
as
independent
institutional
investors
swfs
which
often
invest
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
national
resources
or
manufactured
goods
have
traditionally
enjoyed
the
legal
immunity
reserved
for
a
sovereign
to
protect
their
assets
in
foreign
jurisdictions
the
rulings
in
the
kazakhstan
case
made
waves
because
they
ignore
that
immunity
this
is
a
dangerous
and
worrisome
precedent
for
other
funds
said
paul
rose
an
ohio
state
university
law
professor
specialising
in
swfs
lots
of
funds
will
be
looking
very
carefully
at
the
outcome
of
this
case
and
wondering
whether
their
assets
can
be
the
kazakh
government
has
said
it
will
challenge
the
judgements
whether
kazakhstan
succeeds
in
getting
the
accounts
unfrozen
or
not
those
watching
the
case
reckon
it
is
a
landmark
for
swfs
whose
trillion
in
global
investments
range
from
real
estate
to
equities
and
government
bonds
in
countries
such
as
norway
where
disputes
between
investors
and
the
government
are
more
likely
to
be
dealt
with
through
efficient
and
independent
domestic
courts
swfs
have
little
cause
to
worry
analysts
say
but
the
kazakh
case
should
be
a
concern
for
countries
with
a
poor
track
record
on
investor
protection
as
it
could
encourage
disgruntled
investors
to
target
swfs
assets
kirill
dmitriev
head
of
the
russian
direct
investment
fund
predicted
repercussions
from
the
kazakh
case
swfs
represent
a
significant
share
of
global
capital
and
any
attacks
on
swfs
may
trigger
significant
market
turbulence
he
said
orders
in
dutch
and
belgian
courts
required
bank
of
new
york
mellon
to
freeze
monies
it
held
in
custody
for
the
kazakh
national
fund
and
the
republic
of
kazakhstan
the
dutch
court
order
has
since
been
lifted
the
belgian
ruling
is
still
in
place
but
kazakhstan
will
challenge
it
at
a
court
hearing
that
has
been
adjourned
until
april
kazakh
assets
in
luxembourg
and
sweden
are
still
frozen
swf
assets
have
been
frozen
before
but
only
in
exceptional
circumstances
for
instance
the
united
nations
imposed
a
freeze
on
the
libyan
investment
authority
s
overseas
assets
in
as
it
feared
personnel
in
the
deposed
government
would
spirit
them
away
the
kazakh
asset
freezes
followed
a
decision
by
the
stockholm
chamber
of
commerce
to
award
stati
and
his
some
million
in
an
arbitration
the
body
provides
dispute
resolution
services
to
international
businesses
but
it
is
not
a
court
and
is
up
to
national
courts
to
enforce
its
decisions
kazakhstan
is
refusing
to
pay
and
president
nursultan
nazarbayev
s
government
said
it
has
done
nothing
wrong
it
has
argued
that
this
ruling
was
based
on
fraudulent
information
according
to
a
press
release
from
the
kazakh
justice
ministry
stati
s
petition
to
a
belgian
court
to
enforce
the
award
resulted
in
an
order
requiring
bny
mellon
to
freeze
billion
in
kazakh
national
fund
and
republic
of
kazakhstan
assets
the
assets
are
held
in
custody
by
bny
mellon
s
european
bank
the
bank
of
new
york
mellon
bny
mellon
declined
to
comment
stati
also
obtained
a
separate
order
from
a
dutch
court
to
freeze
an
approximately
billion
stake
in
kmg
kashagan
owned
by
another
kazakh
swf
kmg
kashagan
is
a
special
purpose
vehicle
through
which
the
country
holds
a
stake
in
the
kashagan
energy
project
there
were
further
orders
to
freeze
assets
in
luxembourg
and
sweden
stati
has
also
tried
to
get
the
award
enforced
in
courts
in
london
and
washington
according
to
press
releases
from
the
kazakh
justice
ministry
those
decisions
would
apply
to
kazakh
assets
held
in
england
or
the
united
states
both
attempts
have
run
into
difficulties
in
a
preliminary
hearing
in
june
the
english
high
court
found
that
the
initial
arbitration
award
may
have
been
obtained
by
fraud
proceedings
are
ongoing
with
a
full
trial
scheduled
to
begin
in
october
the
kazakh
justice
ministry
said
kazakhstan
has
also
filed
a
separate
claim
against
stati
in
washington
with
regard
to
the
alleged
fraud
industry
participants
are
watching
the
court
cases
closely
if
percent
of
a
sovereign
fund
is
frozen
and
you
don
t
have
access
to
it
that
should
be
an
alarm
bell
for
policymakers
said
simon
a
strategist
at
legal
general
investment
management
it
s
been
assumed
so
far
that
these
assets
were
relatively
swfs
have
laboured
for
years
to
position
themselves
as
little
different
from
any
other
institutional
investor
mostly
to
allay
concerns
countries
might
have
about
selling
assets
to
foreign
governments
some
swfs
have
even
renounced
their
sovereign
immunity
in
investment
contracts
according
to
professor
fabio
bassan
an
swf
law
specialist
and
international
law
chair
at
roma
tre
university
but
by
depicting
themselves
as
commercial
investors
rather
than
as
agents
of
the
state
swfs
have
allowed
their
claim
to
sovereign
immunity
to
be
eroded
experts
say
the
more
they
act
like
ordinary
commercial
investors
and
not
as
vehicles
of
the
state
it
creates
a
risk
that
courts
will
not
view
them
as
instruments
of
the
state
and
are
less
likely
to
give
them
immunity
ohio
university
s
rose
said
as
in
the
kazakh
case
courts
in
different
countries
have
different
interpretations
of
the
status
of
an
swf
graham
harris
a
partner
at
law
firm
squire
patton
boggs
noted
that
english
law
still
makes
it
difficult
to
seize
sovereign
wealth
but
continental
european
courts
are
increasingly
likely
to
view
an
swf
as
a
commercial
entity
it
s
a
moving
target
