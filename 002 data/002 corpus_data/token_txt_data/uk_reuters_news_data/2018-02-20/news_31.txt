two
weeks
after

and
gave
what
analysts
saw
as
a
conservative
outlook
maersk
has
acknowledged
that
despite
handling
one
in
seven
containers
globally
being
the
biggest
is
no
longer
enough
as
the
growth
of

driving
demand
for
quicker
easier
and
more
flexible
shipping
our
customers
businesses
are
to
a
large
extent
changing

and
new
ways
of
doing
things

maersk
is
betting
that
a
digital
drive
in
which
it
for
example
has
teamed
up
with
ibm
to
create
an
trading
platform
will
allow
it
to
offer
more
services
in
areas
such
as
freight
forwarding
and
trade
finance

on
tuesday
investors
were
left
with

detail
on
maersk

to
monetise
the
blockchain
project
or
how
it
will
use
the
proceeds
from
breaking
up
the

when
the
total

was
announced
and
around
same
level
as
when
it
announced
its
new
strategy
in
september
many
had
hoped
for
something
more
specific
for

with
regards
to
how
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
maersk
oil
will
be
distributed
