reuters
the
opposition
will
not
field
a
candidate
in
venezuela
s
april
presidential
election
the
exiled
mayor
of
caracas
said
calling
the
vote
a
trap
set
by
president
nicolas
maduro
antonio
ledezma
put
under
house
arrest
in
for
allegedly
plotting
a
coup
before
escaping
to
colombia
in
november
called
for
a
united
nations
probe
into
human
rights
violations
in
the
opec
nation
and
more
humanitarian
aid
it
s
not
a
boycott
we
are
rather
ignoring
a
trap
we
can
not
call
it
an
election
because
we
know
it
is
going
to
be
a
fraud
ledezma
told
reuters
in
geneva
where
he
was
attending
a
human
rights
meeting
organised
by
the
group
un
watch
yes
the
election
has
united
the
opposition
because
we
have
a
shared
opinion
that
this
election
is
just
one
more
lie
from
the
government
he
said
speaking
through
an
interpreter
the
country
of
million
is
close
to
economic
collapse
with
inflation
of
more
than
percent
last
year
and
millions
without
enough
to
eat
critics
say
the
election
is
a
farce
with
maduro
s
main
rivals
barred
from
standing
and
a
compliant
election
body
bound
to
favour
the
ruling
socialists
maduro
denies
the
system
is
undemocratic
there
will
be
no
official
candidate
from
the
opposition
from
the
government
what
we
ve
seen
is
repression
against
the
heads
of
the
opposition
because
they
don
t
want
to
participate
as
that
legitimises
the
process
said
ledezma
who
is
now
based
in
spain
the
real
opposition
is
the
people
the
millions
of
venezuelans
who
want
clear
and
transparent
elections
which
were
denied
us
the
last
thing
we
saw
was
the
government
closing
the
door
to
dialogue
in
our
faces
he
said
referring
to
talks
between
the
government
and
an
opposition
coalition
held
in
the
dominican
republic
in
december
ledezma
met
separately
in
geneva
on
monday
with
high
commissioner
for
human
rights
zeid
ra
ad
and
luis
almagro
of
the
organisation
of
american
states
oas
to
ask
for
support
i
asked
the
high
commissioner
also
to
send
a
commission
to
venezuela
so
that
they
can
be
witness
to
the
human
rights
violations
that
happen
daily
he
said
citing
protests
last
year
during
which
more
than
people
were
killed
the
long
queue
caravans
of
migrants
trying
to
leave
the
country
that
s
a
sign
of
protests
there
are
no
queues
in
front
of
the
supermarkets
because
there
is
no
food
left
in
more
humanitarian
aid
is
needed
but
the
crisis
can
not
be
solved
through
relief
supplies
alone
he
said
adding
with
the
food
and
drug
crisis
in
venezuela
any
aid
would
be
like
putting
a
bandaid
on
a
broken
