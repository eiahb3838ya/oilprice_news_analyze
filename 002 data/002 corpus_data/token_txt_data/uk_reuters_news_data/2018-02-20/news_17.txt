could
ask
the
wto
to
adjudicate
the
complaint
targets
trade
laws
that
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
but
it
adds
to
the
friction
already
stoked
by
trump
s
policy
of
putting
america
first
which
is
widely
seen
as
protectionist
washington
is
already
wrestling
with
a
wto
case
brought
by
canada
that
challenges
the
foundations
of
trade
law
and
is
fighting
china
s
claim
to
be
treated
as
a
market
economy
a
designation
that
could
stymie
defenses
against
beijing
meanwhile
trump
has
thrown
the
whole
wto
dispute
settlement
process
into
crisis
by
blocking
the
appointment
of
new
appeals
judges
threatening
to
halt
the
workings
of
a
system
that
has
refereed
global
commerce
for
almost
quarter
of
a

south
korea
filed
its
complaint
on
challenging
duties

said
last

that
applying
adverse
facts
available
afa
rules
allowed
the
united
states
to
unfairly
levy
high
duties
without
thoroughly
verifying
data
available
to
it
last
may
in
a
dispute
with
china
the
wto
appeals
judges
ruled
that
the
use
of
afa
could
be
challenged
in
a
dispute
although
there
was
not
enough
evidence
to
challenge
them
in
the
chinese
case
the
south
korean
complaint
made
no
mention
of
recent
trade
friction
over
the
imposition
of
safeguard
duties
on
solar
panels
and
washing
machines
seoul
has
asked
washington
for
compensation
in
that
case
a
demand
that
could
potentially
be
undermined
if
it
became
the
subject
of
a
dispute
the
european
union
china
taiwan
and
japan
have
also
demanded
compensation
for
those
safeguard
duties
