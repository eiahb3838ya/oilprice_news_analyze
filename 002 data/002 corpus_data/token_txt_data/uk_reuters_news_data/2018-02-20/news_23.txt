sea

rise
is
a
threat
to
cities
from
shanghai
to
london
to
swathes
of
florida
or
bangladesh
and
to
entire

as

would

even
if
almost
nations
fully
meet
goals
under
the
paris
agreement
which
include
cutting
greenhouse
gas
emissions
to
net
zero
in
the
second
half
of
this
century
ocean
levels
will
rise
inexorably
because
industrial
gases
already
emitted
will

the

also
found
that
every
