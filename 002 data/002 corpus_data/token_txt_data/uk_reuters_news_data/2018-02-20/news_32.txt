bp sees self-driving electric vehicles crimping oil demand by 2040
london
reuters
the
emergence
of
electric
cars
and
travel
sharing
are
set
to
dent
oil
consumption
by
oil
and
gas
giant
bp
said
forecasting
a
peak
in
demand
for
the
first
time
in
its
benchmark
annual
energy
outlook
bp
forecast
a
growth
in
electric
vehicles
by
with
its
chief
economist
spencer
dale
painting
a
world
in
which
we
travel
much
more
but
instead
of
using
private
cars
we
increasingly
share
trips
in
autonomous
vehicles
while
travel
demand
more
than
doubles
over
the
period
as
economies
in
countries
such
as
china
and
india
grow
higher
oil
demand
will
be
more
than
offset
by
increased
engine
efficiency
standards
as
well
as
the
larger
number
of
evs
and
shared
traveling
unlike
many
other
forecasts
including
previous
bp
energy
outlooks
which
looked
solely
at
the
growing
share
of
evs
in
the
car
fleet
bp
this
year
focused
on
the
share
of
vehicles
kilometers
powered
by
electricity
under
bp
s
evolving
transition
scenario
which
assumes
that
policies
and
technology
continue
to
evolve
at
a
speed
similar
to
that
seen
in
the
recent
past
some
percent
of
car
kilometers
are
powered
by
electricity
by
from
almost
zero
in
at
the
same
time
the
number
of
evs
is
set
to
increase
from
million
today
to
over
million
by
representing
roughly
percent
out
of
a
total
car
fleet
of
billion
the
gap
between
the
increasing
number
of
evs
on
the
road
and
the
kilometers
powered
by
electricity
is
due
to
the
expected
growth
in
shared
mobility
by
evs
dale
said
cars
will
be
used
much
more
intensely
over
time
dale
told
reporters
in
a
briefing
on
monday
ahead
of
the
release
of
the
report
on
tuesday
as
a
result
fuel
demand
from
the
car
fleet
is
forecast
to
dip
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
from
million
bpd
in
when
it
represented
around
one
fifth
of
total
oil
demand
according
to
bp
bp
expects
autonomous
vehicles
to
become
available
in
the
early
their
initial
high
cost
means
the
vast
majority
of
the
cars
will
be
bought
by
fleets
offering
shared
mobility
services
the
average
electric
car
is
expected
to
be
driven
about
two
and
a
half
times
more
than
an
internal
combustion
car
according
to
dale
what
we
expect
to
see
in
the
is
a
huge
growth
in
shared
mobility
autonomous
cars
once
you
don
t
have
to
pay
for
a
driver
the
cost
of
taking
one
of
those
share
mobility
fleets
services
will
fall
by
about
or
percent
dale
said
the
vast
majority
of
the
shared
mobility
is
expected
to
be
evs
because
of
their
lower
maintenance
costs
car
makers
including
general
motors
and
giants
such
as
google
waymo
and
uber
technologies
have
poured
billions
into
the
autonomous
vehicles
industry
hoping
gain
a
advantage
services
are
seen
as
the
main
use
for
most
vehicles
bp
sharply
raised
its
estimate
of
growth
in
electric
vehicles
in
the
coming
decades
from
last
year
s
forecast
that
evs
would
reach
million
by
the
big
upwards
revision
is
due
to
an
increase
in
hybrid
cars
and
an
expected
sharp
growth
in
ev
purchases
in
the
second
half
of
the
dale
said
bp
joined
other
oil
companies
such
as
royal
dutch
shell
in
forecasting
a
peak
for
oil
demand
in
the
late
when
it
is
expected
to
slightly
decline
at
around
million
bpd
it
did
not
foresee
a
peak
in
demand
in
its
previous
outlooks
that
stretched
into
while
the
transportation
sector
will
continue
to
dominate
the
growth
in
oil
consumption
demand
for
plastic
manufacturing
will
become
the
main
source
of
growth
in
the
oil
companies
such
as
bp
shell
and
france
s
total
are
betting
on
growing
demand
from
the
petrochemical
sector
in
the
coming
decades
dale
however
said
changes
in
regulations
for
plastics
consumption
such
as
stringent
policies
on
plastic
bags
and
packaging
could
dent
oil
demand
by
as
much
as
million
bpd
roughly
the
same
as
the
impact
of
evs
overall
energy
demand
will
continue
to
grow
in
the
coming
decades
rising
by
a
third
into
or
roughly
percent
per
year
driven
by
growth
in
china
and
india
but
the
world
is
learning
to
do
more
with
less
energy
as
economies
become
more
efficient
dale
said
for
example
the
european
union
s
gross
domestic
product
is
set
to
treble
in
from
but
the
level
of
energy
demand
will
be
the
same
china
s
energy
demand
will
continue
to
grow
but
at
a
slower
pace
by
the
when
india
will
become
the
main
driver
of
growth
bp
once
again
revised
upwards
its
forecast
for
growth
in
renewable
power
which
is
set
to
grow
by
percent
by
with
its
share
in
the
energy
mix
increasing
from
percent
to
percent
the
revision
is
due
to
technological
gains
as
well
as
more
aggressive
government
policies
particularly
in
india
and
china
there
is
plenty
of
scope
for
policy
to
continue
to
surprise
us
to
further
boost
the
growth
in
the
renewables
