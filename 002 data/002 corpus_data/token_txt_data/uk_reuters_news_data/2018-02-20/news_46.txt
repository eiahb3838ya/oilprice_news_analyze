london
reuters
opec
and
oil
producers
including
russia
will
discuss
extending
their
cooperation
for
many
more
years
when
they
meet
in
june
as
they
seek
to
avoid
major
market
shocks
the
united
arab
emirates
energy
minister
told
reuters
suhail
said
the
uae
opec
s
biggest
producer
saudi
arabia
and
russia
supported
extending
cooperation
beyond
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
next
meets
in
june
in
vienna
and
producers
participating
in
a
agreement
which
took
effect
in
january
are
expected
to
attend
he
said
that
trust
that
has
been
built
up
has
made
decisions
much
easier
mazroui
said
it
was
too
early
to
say
how
the
cooperation
will
work
exactly
and
whether
oil
production
management
would
be
maintained
but
he
added
that
market
monitoring
was
the
bare
minimum
the
group
would
do
to
help
avoid
gluts
or
shortages
the
idea
of
extending
cooperation
beyond
when
the
current
oil
cut
agreement
expires
has
prompted
many
analysts
to
say
that
opec
and
russia
are
effectively
creating
a
wider
super
group
with
moscow
becoming
a
opec
member
i
never
said
super
group
the
name
isn
t
important
what
s
important
is
how
we
keep
it
together
mazroui
said
i
don
t
want
to
concentrate
on
one
country
but
definitely
russia
is
a
very
important
partner
