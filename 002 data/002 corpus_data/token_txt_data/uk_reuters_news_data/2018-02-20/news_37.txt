corrected-nustar, other energy partnerships simplify business models to spur growth
houston
reuters
some
energy
pipeline
and
partnerships
are
restructuring
into
simpler
business
models
to
help
attract
new
investors
and
spur
growth
rising
oil
and
gas
production
has
spawned
billions
of
dollars
of
new
transport
gathering
and
storage
projects
but
the
companies
most
responsible
for
these
projects
can
allocate
up
to
percent
of
their
income
to
the
general
partner
leaving
less
for
other
holders
or
to
invest
in
new
projects
historically
these
firms
have
passed
most
of
their
income
along
to
holders
and
sold
equity
or
debt
to
finance
new
projects
or
acquisitions
but
in
the
last
year
what
they
have
had
to
offer
investors
has
jumped
mplx
energy
logistics
lp
for
instance
paid
a
percent
annualized
distribution
last
quarter
to
its
holders
up
from
percent
a
year
earlier
according
to
figures
from
investment
firm
east
daley
capital
advisors
the
higher
cash
yield
makes
the
economics
of
these
projects
a
little
tougher
said
kendrick
rhea
an
analyst
at
east
daley
capital
he
estimates
the
cost
of
equity
has
risen
nearly
a
third
for
some
companies
in
the
last
year
nustar
energy
and
archrock
in
recent
weeks
said
they
would
cut
income
distributions
to
the
general
partners
and
combine
units
shifting
away
from
the
general
and
limited
partners
structures
common
among
energy
pipeline
and
storage
firms
competitor
tallgrass
energy
in
early
february
said
it
was
considering
a
similar
change
removing
a
layer
of
complexity
makes
partnerships
a
lot
more
investible
said
james
mick
a
portfolio
manager
for
tortoise
which
invests
in
energy
master
limited
partnerships
mlps
private
equity
firms
have
been
successfully
acquiring
pipeline
operators
in
the
shale
patch
because
of
their
lower
cost
of
capital
they
are
proving
strong
rivals
to
mlps
for
these
deals
because
of
their
willingness
to
use
more
debt
financing
nustar
archrock
and
tallgrass
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
an
early
move
away
from
partnership
models
came
in
when
kinder
morgan
inc
then
the
largest
publicly
traded
pipeline
partnership
folded
three
units
into
a
single
company
to
address
investor
concerns
about
its
growth
and
financial
structure
mick
estimates
that
up
to
percent
of
the
mlps
tortoise
covers
will
have
eliminated
incentive
distribution
rights
within
the
next
two
years
to
free
up
cash
for
growth
as
of
last
year
about
percent
had
eliminated
their
payouts
called
incentive
distribution
rights
idrs
compared
with
percent
in
he
said
another
factor
in
the
restructurings
are
institutional
investors
seeking
stronger
governance
and
more
independent
boards
in
some
cases
about
percent
of
a
limited
partner
s
board
will
be
comprised
of
individuals
appointed
by
the
general
partner
investors
said
in
the
real
world
i
don
t
see
how
directors
can
be
truly
independent
and
represent
the
best
interests
of
the
limited
partners
if
they
can
be
fired
by
the
general
partner
said
kevin
mccarthy
a
managing
partner
at
investment
firm
kayne
anderson
capital
advisors
restructuring
the
partnerships
to
resemble
corporations
could
draw
renewed
interest
from
investors
helping
the
firms
raise
new
cash
our
view
is
that
governance
has
to
change
if
the
sector
is
going
to
move
to
the
next
level
and
attract
the
attention
of
institutional
investors
mccarthy
added
although
mature
mlps
are
revamping
their
structures
newer
firms
that
go
public
are
expected
to
continue
using
mechanisms
such
as
idrs
to
encourage
growth
hess
corp
and
bp
plc
last
year
both
launched
mlps
that
included
incentive
distribution
payments
to
partners
it
is
unlikely
they
will
go
away
for
new
issuance
and
partnership
structures
moving
forward
they
are
simply
too
lucrative
if
executed
correctly
