reuters
airbus
got
a
boost
for
its
largest
jet
on
tuesday
when
qatar
airways
said
it
was
considering
upgrading
some
of
its
orders
to
the
largest
model
as
it
took
delivery
of
the
first
such
plane
the
is
designed
to
seat
people
and
competes
with
boeing
s
profitable
the
first
was
handed
over
to
the
gulf
carrier
on
tuesday
joining
the
smaller
which
has
been
in
service
for
three
years
airbus
says
the
lightweight
is
percent
more
efficient
than
the
most
popular
current
version
of
the
the
but
sales
of
the
have
picked
up
and
boeing
is
working
on
plans
to
leapfrog
the
with
an
upgraded
boasting
over
seats
boeing
last
year
sold
against
just
one
order
for
the
some
airlines
have
begun
downgrading
some
orders
to
the
qatar
airways
which
has
ordered
both
the
and
the
indicated
it
was
moving
in
the
opposite
direction
and
said
it
could
shift
more
of
its
orders
to
the
largest
model
there
is
a
possibility
that
we
could
convert
some
of
the
to
the
chief
executive
akbar
al
baker
said
qatar
is
the
top
customer
with
on
order
including
which
have
a
list
price
of
million
it
recently
canceled
four
orders
following
delays
but
subsequently
to
the
new
european
jet
family
the
prospect
of
upgrades
will
come
as
a
relief
to
airbus
which
is
gambling
on
the
to
contain
any
market
pressure
from
the
as
boeing
develops
its
new
model
last
summer
the
european
planemaker
shelved
tentative
plans
for
an
even
bigger
that
would
compete
more
directly
with
boeing
s
planned
fabrice
bregier
speaking
on
his
last
day
as
airbus
chief
operating
officer
said
on
tuesday
studies
had
shown
the
idea
worked
in
principle
but
that
airbus
would
focus
instead
on
pushing
the
it
s
now
time
to
start
to
be
more
aggressive
and
to
explain
to
our
customers
or
boeing
s
customers
that
this
aircraft
will
be
a
better
choice
than
a
bregier
said
boeing
insists
that
its
jet
will
be
the
world
s
most
efficient
aircraft
in
its
category
thanks
to
new
wings
baker
said
qatar
airways
one
of
the
world
s
major
fleet
buyers
is
not
interested
in
an
version
of
the
being
floated
by
airbus
for
carriers
like
qantas
but
could
buy
more
of
regular
jets
yes
there
may
in
future
be
a
requirement
for
more
of
these
airplanes
for
qatar
airways
especially
when
we
do
further
enhancements
of
our
acquisitions
he
said
and
of
course
there
is
a
probability
we
will
buy
more
of
these
airplanes
to
put
in
our
leasing
he
also
ruled
out
orders
for
the
largest
and
smallest
airbus
jets
whether
the
of
which
it
has
bought
and
has
options
for
another
three
or
the
bombardier
cseries
a
to
that
airbus
agreed
to
rescue
last
year
