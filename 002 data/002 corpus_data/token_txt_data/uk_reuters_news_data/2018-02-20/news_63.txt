agreement
on
plans

the
plan
to
expand
the
papua
new
guinea
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
plant
to
around
million
tonnes
per

mtpa
would
see
it
rival
australia
s
biggest
lng
projects
at
a
cost
of
around
billion
according
to
analysts
oil
search
said
the
companies
plan
to
add
three
new
lng
units
or
trains
with
two
underpinned
by
gas
from
the
fields
run
by
total
and
one
underpinned
by
existing
fields
and
the
new
p
nyang
field
run
by
exxon
there
s
no
doubt
that
keeping
it
simple
is
one
of
the
great
advantages
of
the
concept
that
is
presently
on
the
table
managing
director
peter
botten
told
analysts
after
the
company
reported
a
near
threefold
rise
in
annual
core
profit
it
also
allows
a
smart
way
of
both
marketing
gas
and
the
partners
aim
to
start
engineering
and
design
work
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
but
first
need
to
agree
terms
with
the
png
government
botten
said
these
include
domestic
gas
supply
requirements
local
content
and
landowner
agreements
the
companies
also
need
to
sign
off
on
and
phasing
the
timing
of
their
gas
field
developments
joint
venture
alignment
challenges
remain
and
shouldn
t
be
underestimated
said
saul
kavonic
an
analyst
with
consultants
wood
mackenzie
botten
was
confident
exxonmobil
and
total
are
committed
to
the
project
which
is
aiming
for
a
final
investment
decision
in
i
know
they
all
have
other
interests
around
the
world
but
in
no
way
do
i
see
any
blinking
or
any
reluctance
to
move
these
projects
forward
they
re
good
economic
solid
projects
he
told
reporters
the
expansion
is
expected
to
be
much
cheaper
than
the
original
billion
cost
of
building
the
png
lng
plant
botten
said
declining
to
comment
on
the
cost
estimate
ahead
of
further
engineering
work
bernstein
analysts
estimate
the
mtpa
of
new
capacity
could
be
added
for
between
billion
and
billion
or
around
a
ton
that
would
be
less
than
half
the
per
ton
cost
of
chevron
corp
s
gorgon
lng
plant
in
australia
which
is
slightly
smaller
than
the
expanded
png
lng
plant
would
be
australia
s
other
major
lng
plant
is
the
north
west
shelf
which
has
annual
production
of
around
mtpa
this
is
the
big
shift
in
the
next
cycle
of
the
lng
story
it
s
very
much
about
lower
cost
brownfield
backfill
developments
bernstein
analyst
neil
beveridge
said
the
partners
in
papua
new
guinea
are
racing
to
start
producing
from
the
new
trains
by
around
or
when
the
lng
market
is
expected
to
need
new
supply
due
to
rapidly
growing
demand
in
asia
and
a
lack
of
other
new
projects
we
believe
we
re
marketing
at
a
perfect
time
for
png
lng
and
papua
lng
to
secure
these
markets
botten
told
analysts
he
was
speaking
after
oil
search
reported
core
profit
for
rose
to
million
from
million
a
year
earlier
on
the
back
of
sharply
higher
oil
and
gas
prices
and
higher
sales

version
of
the
