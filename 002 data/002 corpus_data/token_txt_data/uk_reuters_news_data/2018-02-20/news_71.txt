singapore
said
its
sales
tax
will
rise
to
percent
from
percent
but
the
change
will
only
come
sometime
between
and
making
it
likely
that
the
increase
would
kick
in
after
the
s
next
general
election
instead
of
getting
a
gst
hike
soon
singaporeans
aged
and
above
will
get
a
hong

red
packet
as

announced
a

on
their

the
bonus
comes
after
singapore
s
economy
grew
percent
in
its
best
pace
in
three
years
global
economic
growth
plus
comments
by
policymakers
on
the
importance
of
raising
revenue
to
meet
future
spending
needs
for
singapore
s
ageing
population
led
many
analysts
to
expect
that
the
goods
and
services
tax
kept
at
percent
since
would
increase
as
early
as
the
coming
fiscal
year
the
surprise
for
us
was
that
the
planned
increase
was
for
a
much
later
period
said
jeff
ng
chief
economist
asia
for
continuum
economics
this
eases
the
need
for
a
future
government
or
administration
to
announce
the
gst
ng
said
singapore
s
next
general
election
is
due
to
be
held
by
january

action
party
won
percent
of
the
vote
a
strong
improvement
from
the
percent
garnered
in
after
announcing
the
planned
gst
hike
the
finance
minister
said
the
exact
timing
will
depend
on
the
state
of
the
economy
how
much
our
expenditures
grow
and
how
buoyant
our
existing
taxes
are
but
i
expect
that
we
will
need
to
do
so
earlier
rather
than
later
in
the
singapore
introduced
a
gst
in
with
a
percent
rate
this
was
raised
to
percent
in
and

then
to

the
current
rate

among
the
world
s
lowest
for
a
consumption
tax
besides
the
plan
for
raising
gst
heng
unveiled
other
tax
measures
these
include
increasing
the

stamp
duty
on

effective
from

raising
the
excise
duty

by
heng
said
spending
needs
will
rise
across
various
sectors
in
coming
years
including
in
healthcare
infrastructure
and
security
the
government
expects
average
annual

spending
to
rise
from

currently
to
almost

over
the
next

the
