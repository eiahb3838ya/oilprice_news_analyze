the

customer
diversifies
anadarko
s
supply
offering
and
could
see
east
african
lng
flowing
into
the

terminals
as
declining
indigenous
gas
production
makes
europe
more
reliant

reaching
this

to
validate
mozambique

position

anadarko

executive

lng
project
developers
across
the
board
have
struggled
to
find
the
buyers
needed
before
banks

export
credit
agencies
could
commit
financing
for
new
plants
low
oil
prices
surging
global
lng
output
and
buyer
s
demands
for
flexibility
shorter
contract
terms
and
competitive
pricing
have
challenged
the
profitability
of
many
projects
and
delayed
investments
in
new
ones
anadarko
s
spas
hint
at
a
potential
thaw
in
relations
and
a
chance
at
becoming
the
first
major
east
african
lng
project
to
reach
fid
just
as
rising
demand
lifts
prices
and
encourages
investments
in
new
supply
the
between
buyers
and
sellers
has
unsettled
lenders
a
typical
financing
model
asked
buyers
to
pay
for
a
plant
s
entire
output
over
thereby
guaranteeing
returns
on
loans
buyers
growing
rejection
of
this
model
has
led
to
calls
for
shorter
terms
smaller
volumes
and
flexibility
to
adjust
or
divert
supply
as
circumstances
change
making
it
harder
for
banks
to
commit
funds
in
light
of
new
project
risks
with
regards
to
our
project
financing
efforts
lenders
are
keenly
engaged
and
have
indicated
a
willingness
to
support
the
initial
project
with
the
necessary
levels
of
project
finance
commitments
wells
said
we
are
actively
negotiating
the
