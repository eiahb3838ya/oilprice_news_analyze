even
if
little
crude
arrived
much
of
that
cash
in
turn
flowed
to
the
investors
that
own
both
pes
and
north
yard
led
by
the
carlyle
group
a
global
private
equity
firm
with
billion
in
assets
the
deal
in
effect
guaranteed
lucrative
payouts
to
carlyle
regardless
of
whether
the
refinery
benefitted
from
the
arrangement
when
oil
market
conditions
made
the
rail
shipments
unprofitable
later
that
year
the
refinery
took
heavy
losses
while
its
investors
continued
to
collect
large
distributions
for
two
more
years
the
rail
contract
exemplifies
the
financial
demands
carlyle
imposed
on
pes
in
the
years
leading
up
to
the
refiner
s
bankruptcy
in
january
the
consortium
collected
at
least
million
in
cash
distributions
from
pes
before
it
collapsed
according
to
a
reuters
review
of
bankruptcy
filings
carlyle
paid
million
in
for
its
stake
in
the
refiner
more
than
half
the
distributions
to
the
investors
were
financed
by
loans
against
pes
assets
that
the
refiner
now
can
t
pay
back
the
filings
show
the
rest
came
from
the
refiner
s
operating
budget
and
payments
pes
made
under
the
terminal
deal
to
north
yard
a
firm
with
no
offices
or
employees
that
pes
spun
off
in
for
a
graphic
detailing
how
pes
went
bankrupt
see
pes
has
blamed
its
bankruptcy
on
environmental
regulations
that
require
all
refiners
to
cover
the
costs
of
blending
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
gasoline
but
the
train
terminal
deal
and
other
large
payouts
to
investors
played
key
roles
in
the
refiner
s
collapse
according
to
filings
and
five
current
or
former
pes
employees
who
were
involved
in
the
refinery
s
the
employees
spoke
to
reuters
on
condition
of
anonymity
the
investor
payouts
along
with
a
slump
in
refining
economics
left
pes
unable
to
cover
its
obligations
under
the
renewable
fuel
standard
or
the
loans
it
took
to
finance
the
distributions
to
carlyle
the
filings
show
pes
had
million
in
debt
and
million
in
cash
on
hand
when
it
filed
bankruptcy
last
month
it
now
hopes
to
restructure
and
continue
operations
which
employ
about
people
carlyle
group
spokesman
christopher
ullman
declined
to
comment
on
whether
the
distributions
or
the
deal
contributed
to
the
refiner
s
bankruptcy
pes
spokeswoman
cherice
corley
defended
the
payments
to
carlyle
and
said
the
biofuels
regulations
played
a
significant
role
its
collapse
we
feel
our
capital
structure
was
appropriate
and
any
suggestion
that
it
was
the
cause
of
our
restructuring
is
completely
ignoring
the
significant
effect
of
the
flawed
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
corley
said
other
refiners
and
pennsylvania
officials
have
also
blamed
biofuels
regulation
for
the
south
philadelphia
refinery
s
failure
triggering
renewed
debate
about
the
program
on
capitol
hill
refiners
without
the
necessary
blending
facilities
such
as
pes
are
required
to
purchase
regulatory
credits
known
as
rins
from
firms
that
do
such
blending
the
cost
of
compliance
for
pes
rose
from
million
in
to
million
in
as
prices
increased
for
the
credits
which
are
traded
in
an
open
market
the
refiner
however
failed
to
pay
a
large
portion
of
that
obligation
in
addition
to
its
conventional
debt
pes
still
owes
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
regulatory
credits
worth
about
million
an
amount
tied
to
the
fuel
it
produced
over
the
past
two
years
according
to
filings
the
firm
stopped
buying
rins
last
year
and
instead
sold
them
to
other
refiners
for
what
likely
amounted
to
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
reuters
reported
in
november
the
corn
and
ethanol
lobby
has
pushed
back
on
the
argument
that
biofuels
regulation
sunk
pes
pointing
out
that
other
refiners
governed
by
the
same
law
are
raking
in
their
highest
profits
in
years
the
refinery
s
failure
had
more
to
do
with
the
hefty
profits
it
paid
to
carlyle
as
its
cash
reserves
dwindled
and
its
debt
soared
said
brooke
coleman
head
of
the
advanced
biofuels
council
the
carlyle
group
looks
more
like
a
corporate
raider
than
a
savior
in
this
deal
coleman
said
carlyle
would
not
lose
any
of
its
gains
on
the
pes
investment
under
the
refiner
s
proposed
restructuring
plan
which
has
the
support
of
almost
all
creditors
according
to
filings
pes
also
asks
the
bankruptcy
court
to
entirely
absolve
its
million
obligation
to
the
epa
epa
spokeswoman
liz
bowman
declined
to
comment
on
the
delinquent
pes
credit
obligations
citing
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
carlyle
bought
its
stake
in
pes
as
many
other
east
coast
refineries
were
closing
down
because
of
weak
margins
the
previous
owner
sunoco
now
energy
transfer
partners
contributed
the
refinery
s
assets
and
became
a
partner
the
million
carlyle
paid
was
its
only
investment
in
pes
filings
show
and
the
firm
soon
recouped
its
acquisition
costs
through
a
loan
against
the
refinery
at
the
direction
of
its
board
pes
borrowed
million
in
march
and
paid
million
of
that
to
investors
according
to
bankruptcy
filings
pes
then
spent
million
building
the
rail
terminal
that
year
and
million
in
to
double
its
capacity
at
the
time
oil
production
was
skyrocketing
as
improved
drilling
technology
unlocked
new
reserves
in
places
such
as
north
dakota
carlyle
saw
an
opportunity
to
tap
this
cheaper
supply
and
wean
pes
off
costly
imports
the
plan
worked
well
at
first
in
and
and
pes
posted
earnings
of
about
million
for
the
two
years
combined
in
january
pes
spun
off
the
terminal
creating
north
yard
as
a
separate
firm
pes
then
signed
a
agreement
with
north
yard
to
pay
for
each
barrel
unloaded
and
agreed
to
a
minimum
quarterly
volume
of
bpd
guaranteeing
the
million
quarterly
payments
to
north
yard
for
any
barrel
pes
unloaded
above
the
threshold
the
refinery
paid
north
yard
cents
the
system
was
designed
to
reward
pes
for
success
but
had
no
contingency
plan
to
protect
the
refiner
against
the
failure
that
would
quickly
follow
the
deal
the
rail
terminal
has
averaged
just
bpd
since
the
contract
was
signed
according
to
figures
provided
to
reuters
by
energy
intelligence
service
genscape
because
carlyle
and
pes
could
no
longer
access
crude
at
prices
low
enough
to
make
the
rail
shipments
profitable
that
left
pes
paying
millions
of
dollars
to
carlyle
through
north
yard
for
oil
shipments
it
never
received
carlyle
s
purchase
of
pes
and
the
rail
terminal
investment
were
bets
that
oil
would
remain
cheap
relative
to
imports
a
glut
of
domestic
production
had
caused
crude
to
sell
at
a
deep
discount
to
imported
barrels
with
the
gap
averaging
about
between
and
but
by
late
an
oil
price
rebound
slashed
the
domestic
discount
to
less
than
a
barrel
not
enough
to
cover
the
cost
of
a
long
rail
journey
pes
nonetheless
continued
to
pay
north
yard
a
total
of
million
between
until
august
filings
show
the
investor
group
received
million
in
eight
distributions
of
the
total
paid
to
north
yard
in
november
of
that
year
pes
took
on
more
debt
to
finance
more
payouts
to
investors
borrowing
a
total
of
million
in
two
loans
against
the
rail
terminal
and
delivering
the
proceeds
its
backers
filings
show
corley
the
pes
spokeswoman
said
terminal
investment
more
than
paid
for
itself
during
its
more
profitable
period
but
for
last
two
years
pes
said
in
filings
the
refinery
remained
largely
cut
off
from
the
cheap
crude
it
needed
to
survive
perversely
it
became
cheaper
to
transport
crude
oil
from
north
dakota
to
points
in
western
europe
than
it
was
to
transport
the
same
crude
oil
to
philadelphia
the
firm
