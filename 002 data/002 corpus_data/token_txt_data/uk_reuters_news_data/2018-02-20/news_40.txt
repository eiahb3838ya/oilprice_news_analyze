exclusive-turkey yet to issue gazprom permit for turkstream land pipeline - sources
moscow
reuters
turkey
has
yet
to
issue
a
permit
for
russia
s
gazprom
to
start
building
the
part
of
the
turkstream
gas
pipeline
three
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
stoking
fears
the
strategically
important
project
will
be
delayed
if
completed
the
billion
euro
billion
pounds
pipeline
would
allow
russia
to
reduce
its
reliance
on
ukraine
as
a
transit
route
for
its
gas
supplies
to
europe
ankara
has
authorised
gazprom
which
has
a
de
facto
monopoly
on
russian
gas
exports
by
pipeline
to
start
building
two
undersea
sections
of
the
project
however
it
has
still
not
given
gazprom
the
green
light
for
the
segment
to
ship
russian
gas
onward
to
southern
europe
the
sources
told
reuters
there
is
no
permission
from
turkey
which
hampers
talks
about
building
the
second
line
to
europe
one
of
the
sources
familiar
with
the
talks
said
relations
between
moscow
and
kiev
have
been
badly
strained
by
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
and
a
insurgency
in
eastern
ukraine
even
before
this
the
countries
had
a
series
of
disputes
over
gas
prices
with
the
kremlin
accusing
ukraine
of
diverting
supplies
to
domestic
consumers
that
were
supposed
to
transit
to
european
union
countries
russia
therefore
wants
to
ship
gas
by
alternative
transit
routes
as
much
and
soon
as
possible
it
is
planning
to
boost
capacity
of
an
existing
undersea
pipeline
to
germany
a
project
known
as
nord
stream
which
together
with
turkstream
would
remove
the
need
to
send
any
gas
via
ukraine
any
serious
delay
to
turkstream
a
project
promoted
by
president
vladimir
putin
could
deepen
doubts
among
some
western
analysts
that
it
will
ever
be
built
in
its
current
form
turkstream
is
designed
to
deliver
more
supplies
to
turkey
the
biggest
buyer
of
russian
gas
after
germany
more
significantly
for
moscow
it
is
also
designed
to
extend
across
turkey
to
the
borders
of
southern
europe
thus
opening
up
a
new
transit
route
for
russian
gas
gazprom
which
did
not
respond
to
a
written
request
for
comment
wants
to
complete
the
pipeline
s
construction
in
so
time
is
of
the
essence
a
second
source
said
the
permit
problem
might
be
related
to
talks
between
gazprom
and
turkish
state
company
botas
about
a
possible
discount
for
russian
gas
it
looks
like
gazprom
will
have
to
give
in
to
botas
the
source
said
a
third
source
in
the
turkish
energy
industry
told
reuters
that
botas
and
gazprom
had
yet
to
set
up
a
joint
venture
they
were
meant
to
form
for
the
part
of
turkstream
this
was
why
a
construction
permit
had
not
yet
been
issued
the
source
added
botas
and
the
turkish
energy
ministry
declined
to
comment
for
turkstream

gazprom

of
the
two

almost

the

s
entire
subsea

gazprom
already

an

turkstream
s
birth
has
been
troubled
gazprom
was
forced
to
abandon
plans
for
a
total
of
four
turkstream
lines
after
failing
to
agree
on
an
entry
point
into
southern
europe
talks
between
moscow
and
ankara
about
the
project
were
also
suspended
in
october
after
the
turkish
military
downed
a
russian
warplane
near
the
border
putin
and
his
turkish
counterpart
tayyip
erdogan
eventually
mended
their
relations
and
agreed
to
revive
trade
ties
a
year
later
russia
and
turkey
have
since
begun
to
cooperate
with
iran
on
trying
to
find
a
solution
to
the
syrian
crisis
putin
and
erdogan
are
in
regular
contact
on
