interview-in the deepwater vs shale oil contest, shell backs both
london
reuters
royal
dutch
shell
will
expand
deepwater
output
and
turn
a
profit
from
its
shale
production
in
coming
years
as
both
together
will
help
the
oil
major
cope
with
a
world
of
low
crude
prices
the
head
of
its
oil
and
gas
production
said
on
tuesday
shell
s
deepwater
production
in
brazil
nigeria
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
much
bigger
and
more
profitable
but
the
firm
sees
the
nimble
onshore
shale
as
an
engine
for
growth
we
can
see
strong
shale
production
growth
strong
cash
surpluses
that
gives
us
a
balance
in
our
portfolio
where
you
can
ramp
investment
up
and
down
you
can
moderate
that
very
unlike
deepwater
which
is
quite
chunky
andy
brown
told
reuters
in
an
interview
on
the
sidelines
of
the
ip
week
conference
they
sit
nicely
together
in
a
now
mammoth
deepwater
projects
and
smaller
shale
fields
both
compete
for
shell
s
capital
and
could
generate
profits
with
oil
as
low
as
a
barrel
brown
said
benchmark
brent
crude
is
now
trading
at
about
up
from
below
at
the
start
of
following
shell
s
billion
acquisition
of
bg
group
in
the
company
became
a
major
player
in
deep
water
which
is
set
to
produce
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
boed
by
the
end
of
the
decade
roughly
a
fifth
of
shell
s
total
output
today
it
produces
about
boed
shell
made
its
deepwater
goals
clear
when
it
swept
up
nearly
half
the
gulf
of
mexico
oil
and
gas
blocks
awarded
in
a
mexican
auction
in
january
months
after
picking
up
brazilian
blocks
the
offshore
business
was
set
to
generate
billion
to
billion
a
year
in
free
cash
flow
in
the
next
three
years
roughly
a
quarter
of
shell
s
total
free
cash
flow
brown
said
the
aim
is
to
get
it
the
cash
generation
and
sustain
it
through
the
next
decade
he
said
shell
aimed
to
approve
several
new
deepwater
developments
this
year
including
vito
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
bonga
southwest
in
nigeria
he
said
adding
it
would
also
work
on
plans
to
develop
its
gulf
of
mexico
whale
discovery
brown
has
overseen
a
sharp
reduction
in
development
costs
in
recent
years
with
the
help
of
new
technology
and
by
simplifying
designs
to
make
projects
profitable
at
lower
oil
prices
but
shell
along
with
others
such
as
exxon
mobil
and
chevron
has
invested
heavily
in
the
shale
businesses
lured
by
lower
development
costs
and
quicker
start
up
shell
still
did
not
generate
a
profit
from
its
shale
activities
much
of
it
focused
in
the
permian
basin
in
west
texas
and
new
mexico
but
aimed
to
break
even
by
a
year
earlier
than
originally
planned
brown
said
we
had
an
ambition
to
get
cash
flow
positive
in
we
accelerated
that
to
there
are
circumstances
we
can
be
cash
flow
positive
this
year
brown
said
shell
would
increase
its
shale
output
to
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
