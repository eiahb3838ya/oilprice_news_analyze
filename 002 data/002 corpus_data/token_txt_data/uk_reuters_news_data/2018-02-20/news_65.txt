a
massive
annual
loss
estimate
by
commodities
trader
noble
group
makes
it
more
likely
that

will
back
its
billion
billion
pounds
restructuring
to
ensure
the
company
s
survival
analysts
said
noble
which
flagged
an
annual
loss
of
up
to
billion
on
monday
announced
an
initial
deal
with
creditors
last
month
to
halve
its
senior
debt
and
give
them
percent
of
the
company
with
existing
equity
holders
diluted
to
percent
the
losses
were
expected
to
clean
the
old
noble
balance
sheet
once
and
for
all
in
doing
so
the
management
makes
endorsing
the
restructuring
the
only
viable
alternative
for
creditors

total
net
loss
of

billion
for
the
quarter
to
december
stemming
largely
from
losses
from
its
derivatives
portfolio
i
expect
something
close
to
the
current
deal
to
go
through
based
on
a
much
worse
outcome
for
everybody
if
they
have
to
liquidate
and
start
over
