up

or

from

traders
said
the
higher
wti
prices
were
a
result
of
reduced
flows
from
canada
s
keystone
pipeline
which
has
been
operating
below
capacity
since
late
last
year
due
to
a
leak
cutting
canadian
supplies
into
the
united

outside

brent
crude
eased
on
the
back
of
a
dip
in

and
a
stronger
dollar
which
potentially
curbs
demand
as
it
makes

more
expensive

by

added
opec
and
russia
continue
to
support
the
production
cuts
that
are
due
to
expire
at
the
end
of

and
they
assure

that
there
will
be

expire

while

its

saudi

russia
has
shown
signs
it
may
at

gradually
start

again
saudi
arabia
not

in
an

to
give
the

a

is
keen
for
russia
and

to

up

last

the

rose
for
a
fourth

to

an
indication
that

output
already
at
a
record
million

may
rise
further
the

became
