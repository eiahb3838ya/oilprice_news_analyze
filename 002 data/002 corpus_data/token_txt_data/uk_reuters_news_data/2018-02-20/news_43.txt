insight-off-grid power pioneers pour into west africa
abidjan

standing
by
a
towering
equatorial
forest
kouame
s
new
house
may
be
beyond
the
reach
of
ivory
coast
s
power
grid
but
it
s
perfectly
located
for
solar
power
entrepreneurs
buoyed
by
success
in
east
africa
solar
power
startups
are
pouring
into
west
africa
offering
kits
in
a
race
to
claim
tens
of
millions
of
customers
who
lack
reliable
access
to
electricity
at
least
companies
including
leading
east
african
players
such
as
greenlight
planet
electric
oge
solar
fenix
international
and
bboxx
have
moved
into
the
region
most
within
the
last
two
years
with
a
potential
market
worth
billions
of
dollars
major
european
energy
companies
such
as
french
utilities
edf
and
engie
are
taking
notice
too
it
s
important
to
be
there
now
because
the
race
has
already
started
said
marianne
laigneau
senior
executive
vice
president
of
edf
s
international
division
the
main
challenge
facing
smaller
companies
now
is
how
to
raise
enough
capital
to
supply
the
expensive
solar
kits
in
return
for
small
upfront
payments
from
customers
mobilising
funding
for
firms
providing
home
solar
systems
is
also
part
of
the
government
s
power
africa
initiative
major
power
generation
projects
have
been
slow
to
get
off
the
ground
so
power
africa
has
partnered
with
startups
such
as
oge
and
among
others
to
accelerate
access
in
abidjan
kouame
doesn
t
know
when
or
if
the
national
grid
will
reach
the
outer
edge
of
the
urban
sprawl
but
thanks
to
his
new
solar
panel
kit
he
has
indoor
lighting
an
electric
fan
and
a
television
but
it
s
the
light
bulb
hanging
outside
his
front
door
that
he
values
the
most
at
night
we
were
scared
to
go
outside
the
taxi
driver
says
as
his
pregnant
wife
watches
a
dubbed
brazilian
soap
opera
where
there
is
light
there
is
some
billion
people
around
the
world
have
no
access
to
a
power
grid
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
iea
lighting
and
phone
charging
alone
costs
them
about
billion
billion
pounds
a
year
and
some
estimates
put
their
total
annual
energy
costs
at
more
than
billion
while
governments
in
much
of
the
developing
world
are
extending
access
to
national
networks
africa
is
lagging
with
less
than
percent
of
african
households
connected
iea
figures
show
but
what
has
long
been
decried
as
a
major
obstacle
to
africa
s
development
is
viewed
as
an
opportunity
by
entrepreneurs
such
as
nir
marom
of
lumos
global
the
dutch
startup
that
built
and
sold
kouame
his
kit
i
read
an
article
about
people
paying
cents
a
day
for
kerosene
and
candles
and
that
just
didn
t
make
sense
said
marom
i
said
i
can
give
them
four
kilowatt
hours
for
the
price
of
kerosene
and
that
started
expansion
lumos
global
s
kits
which
cost
about
include
a
solar
panel
linked
to
a
battery
that
supports
power
sockets
a
mobile
phone
adapter
and
led
light
bulbs
kouame
who
paid
cfa
francs
upfront
for
his
kit
is
now
a
digital
counter
on
the
yellow
battery
pack
tells
him
when
he
needs
to
top
up
his
account
using
his
mobile
phone
if
he
doesn
t
pay
the
kit
which
also
houses
a
global
positioning
system
shuts
down
but
in
five
years
he
ll
own
it
outright
and
his
solar
power
will
be
free
five
years
is
nothing
he
says
already
weighing
the
option
of
another
system
to
run
a
large
freezer
sitting
empty
and
unplugged
in
the
corner
of
his
living
room
so
my
wife
can
do
a
little
solar
home
systems
shs
like
kouame
s
have
been
the
main
driver
of
power
expansion
in
africa
in
when
most
purchases
were
limited
to
simple
lighting
systems
customers
spent
to
on
average
over
a
product
s
lifetime
according
to
gogla
an
independent
industry
association
now
it
s
to
global
revenues
from
the
shs
sector
were
million
to
million
in
gogla
estimates
that
should
jump
to
billion
to
billion
in
most
of
the
main
players
in
west
africa
cut
their
teeth
in
east
africa
drawn
by
the
widespread
use
of
mobile
money
transfers
a
key
element
of
the
model
success
there
drove
annual
growth
of
about
percent
from
to
but
as
the
east
african
market
becomes
more
crowded
and
mobile
money
services
spread
across
the
continent
many
are
now
heading
west
i
remember
doing
a
market
sizing
very
early
on
and
from
a
number
of
metrics
west
africa
was
a
better
market
said
xavier
helgesen
ceo
of
electric
oge
one
of
the
sector
leaders
about
half
of
the
overall
african
population
are
in
west
and
central
africa
according
to
the
iea
nigeria
africa
s
biggest
economy
and
most
populous
nation
is
alone
home
to
roughly
million
people
with
no
grid
access
lumos
is
an
outlier
to
the
extent
it
picked
west
africa
as
its
first
market
it
launched
in
nigeria
in
and
by
the
end
of
had
sold
kits
and
was
averaging
percent
revenue
growth
late
last
year
it
expanded
into
ivory
coast
west
africa
s
largest
economy
still
despite
the
rapid
growth
to
date
solar
startups
say
more
must
be
done
to
improve
the
capacity
of
solar
home
systems
and
to
bring
down
their
cost
so
the
sector
can
reach
its
full
potential
i
don
t
believe
electrification
is
a
said
jamie
evans
director
of
partnerships
with
i
believe
it
s
here
to
stay
if
the
price
of
batteries
starts
dropping
precipitously
then
it
will
almost
certainly
change
the
face
of
the
industry
he
said
the
need
to
provide
consumer
financing
for
the
relatively
expensive
kits
means
expansion
requires
significant
capital
but
banks
lacking
expertise
in
the
new
sector
often
shy
away
from
lending
to
companies
said
rolake
akinkugbe
head
of
energy
at
nigeria
s
fbnquest
merchant
bank
there
s
also
a
size
issue
most
of
the
solutions
particularly
those
that
deal
with
from
a
funding
perspective
are
not
within
the
threshold
for
banks
she
said
that
means
startups
have
largely
relied
on
venture
capital
impact
investors
looking
to
generate
social
benefits
as
well
as
a
profit
and
development
finance
institutions
but
the
model
has
its
drawbacks
right
now
companies
are
having
to
constantly
fundraise
said
lyndsay
handler
ceo
of
fenix
international
in
what
was
considered
a
milestone
in
the
african
sector
engie
bought
fenix
in
october
with
access
to
engie
s
capital
handler
says
fenix
aims
to
become
a
leader
serving
millions
in
the
near
term
and
tens
of
millions
further
down
the
road
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
investment
are
needed
to
have
the
impact
we
want
to
have
she
said
facing
stagnating
customer
growth
in
their
home
markets
european
energy
companies
such
as
engie
are
increasingly
looking
abroad
africa
s
underserved
growing
population
is
seen
by
many
as
the
future
the
number
of
africans
without
grid
access
actually
increased
by
nearly
percent
between
and
to
million
people
by
the
iea
estimates
that
some
percent
of
the
global
population
will
be
in
africa
raphael
tilot
engie
africa
s
head
of
customer
solutions
likens
solar
to
the
rise
of
the
mobile
phone
which
landline
networks
on
the
continent
today
no
one
is
thinking
about
putting
telecom
wires
to
individual
houses
in
these
places
you
can
look
at
energy
in
the
same
way
today
he
said
or
solar
home
systems
are
a
far
better
in
addition
to
engie
french
giants
total
and
edf
also
hold
stakes
in
startups
or
are
partnering
with
them
italian
utility
enel
and
germany

are
investing
in
solar
companies
evidence
of
the
market
growth
is
on
exhibit
on
kouame
s
hillside
in
abidjan
where
several
rooftops
including
his
neighbour
s
are
now
crowned
with
solar
panels

how
it
