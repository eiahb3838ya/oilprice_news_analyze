world

wavered
and
the

eased
on
friday
as
turmoil
in
the
trump
administration
kept
markets
watchful
at
the
end
of
a
week
scarred
by
concerns
that
tariffs
could
provoke
a
trade
war
the
msci
world
index
which
tracks
countries
was
flat
after
three
straight
sessions
of
losses
and
was
set
for
a
weekly

of
around
percent
european

found
some
support
in

although
the

was
on
track
for
a
percent
weekly
loss
that
followed
losses
in

concerning

trump
isn
t
giving
markets
much
respite
said
rabobank
analyst
bas
van
geffen
in
a
note
while
still
vague
at
best
the
subpoena
does
bring
the
investigation
yet
another
step
closer
to
the
president
markets
certainly
didn
t
like
the
added
although
world
equities
were
set
for
a
weekly

huge

helped
limit
the

according

cited
by

a
record
billion
was
driven
into
equities
this
week
markets
have
been
buoyed
by
strong
inflows
but
i
think
the
under
current
in
terms
of
news
on
the
trade
front
is
quite
poor
and
i
don
t
think
it
has
played
out
yet
said
gautam

management
the

reported
trump

adding
to

about
the
implications
for

the
developments
together
with
a
report
earlier
this
week
that
trump
is
seeking
to
impose
tariffs
on
up
to
billion
of
chinese
imports
cemented
investors
worries
that
the
administration
is
increasingly
leaning
towards
protectionism
white

trade
adviser
peter
navarro
has
said
that
trump
would
get
options
in
the
coming
weeks
to
address
china
s
theft
and
forced
transfer
of
american
intellectual
property
as
part
of
an
investigation
the
key
here
is
whether
the
main
battle
ground
of
the

war
will
reach
it
