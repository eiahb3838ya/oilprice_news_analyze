a
planned
nuclear
reactor
in
western
finland
owned
by
a
consortium
will
meet
its
commissioning
target
despite
delays
in
licensing
and
will
not
be
affected
by
sanctions
on
russia
supplier
rosatom
said
the
start
date
of
the
gigawatt
gw
hanhikivi
reactor
has
been
in
question
since
september
when
owner
fennovoima
said
the
construction
licence
it
needed
from
the
authorities
would
take
a
year
longer
to
get
due
to
delays
the
fennovoima
consortium
of
which
about
a
third
is
owned
by
a
rosatom
unit
had
also
expressed
concerns
in
its
annual
report
that
economic
sanctions
on
russia
could
affect
its
banks
ability
to
guarantee
the
project
s
funding
we
strongly
believe
that
hanhikivi
can
be
commissioned
in
as
planned
and
we
re
ready
to
deal
with
unpredictable
circumstances
should
they
arise
and
will
adapt
as
necessary
a
rosatom
spokesman
told
reuters
in
an
email
he
said
rosatom
was
working
on
providing
the
delayed
documentation
to
finnish
regulator
stuk
during
in
order
to
get
the
required
construction
permit
to
build
the
reactor
eu
sanctions
against
russia
won
t
affect
the
timeframe
of
the
hanhikivi
project
none
of
the
people
involved
in
the
project
are
on
the
sanctions
list
the
spokesman
added
hanhikivi
estimated
to
cost
between
billion
and
billion
euros
billion
is
set
to
start
producing
electricity
commercially
in
five
years
after
another
finnish
reactor
olkiluoto
comes
online
the
costs
of
olkiluoto
a
reactor
that
was
initially
planned
to
begin
production
in
have
spiralled
from
billion
euros
to
billion
euros
owner
tvo
said
last
week
and
there
was
a
risk
of
that
rising
even
further
in
contrast
to
supplied
by
areva
and
siemens
fennovoima
s
reactor
was
unlikely
to
exceed
the
budget
rosatom
said
we
have
a
vested
interest
as
investor
and
supplier
to
make
sure
that
the
hanhikivi
project
is
achieved
within
the
set
budget
the
spokesman
said
fennovoima
is

includes
more

to
delay
another
