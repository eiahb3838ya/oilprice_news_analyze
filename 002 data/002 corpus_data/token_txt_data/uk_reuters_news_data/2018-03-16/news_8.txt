u.s. nuclear power regulator urged to reject limits on cyber protections
washington
reuters
a
science
advocacy
group
urged
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
on
friday
to
reject
a
longstanding
industry
request
to
limit
cyber
attack
protections
at
nuclear
plants
a
day
after
the
trump
administration
publicly
blamed
moscow
for
hacking
into
nuclear
power
and
other
energy
infrastructure
the
nuclear
energy
institute
industry
group
petitioned
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
in
june
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
agency
s
safeguards
to
only
systems
with
a
direct
impact
on
safety
the
institute
said
in
the
petition
that
such
limits
would
be
less
burdensome
for
operators
of
nuclear
power
plants
while
being
adequately
protective
of
public
health
and
safety
the
petition
is
foolhardy
at
best
and
at
worse
downright
dangerous
said
edwin
lyman
a
senior
scientist
at
the
union
of
concerned
scientists
a
nonprofit
science
advisory
group
the
department
of
homeland
security
and
fbi
on
thursday
said
that
the
russian
government
hacking
campaign
on
energy
and
other
facilities
stretched
back
at
least
two
years
in
light
of
the
growing
cyber
threat
to
nuclear
plants
highlighted
by
yesterday
s
alert
the
agency
should
now
simply
reject
it
lyman
said
nrc
spokesman
david
mcintyre
said
the
agency
sent
the
institute
a
letter
in
september
telling
them
it
was
deferring
consideration
of
the
petition
until
it
completes
a
round
of
inspections
related
to
cyber
security
the
inspections
started
late
last
year
and
will
continue
through
systems
that
control
the
most
critical
safety
equipment
at
nuclear
plants
are
largely
immune
to
cyber
attacks
because
they
are
and
not
connected
to
the
internet
but
many
other
systems
with
key
safety
and
security
functions
are
and
could
be
compromised
via
their
internet
connections
lyman
said
hackers
could
disable
or
reprogram
systems
including
electronic
locks
alarms
television
cameras
and
communications
equipment
the
group
said
some
plants
have
equipment
such
as
cranes
that
move
highly
radioactive
spent
fuel
that
use
systems
that
could
be
manipulated
to
cause
an
accident
it
said
the
united
states
is
the
world
leader
in
nuclear
power
with
operating
reactors
but
the
industry
has
suffered
numerous
closures
in
recent
years
in
the
face
of
a
glut
of
cheap
natural
gas
a
competing
fuel
for
power
plants
and
soaring
safety
protection
costs
as
a
result
of
measures
put
in
place
after
the
attacks
on
nei
spokesman
john
keeley
said
his
group
had
no
comment
on
the
request
by
the
union
of
concerned
scientists
