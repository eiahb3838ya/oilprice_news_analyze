berlin
reuters
germany
s
new
transport
minister
said
on
friday
he
was
no
buddy
of
car
industry
bosses
but
a
friend
of
production
line
workers
and
drivers
who
opposes
bans
for
diesel
vehicles
and
forcing
manufacturers
to
refit
cars
andreas
scheuer
sworn
in
as
minister
this
week
also
told
bild
newspaper
that
he
like
chancellor
angela
merkel
opposed
the
introduction
of
a
system
of
badges
to
identify
more
polluting
diesels
he
said
they
were
the
first
step
towards
the
driving
bans
he
wanted
to
avoid
i
don
t
see
myself
as
a
buddy
of
automobile
bosses
but
rather
as
the
mate
of
those
working
on
the
production
lines
and
as
someone
who
represents
the
interests
of
diesel
vehicle
owners
scheuer
said
some
officials
have
proposed
a
system
of
blue
badges
that
would
allow
cities
with
particularly
bad
air
quality
to
selectively
ban
dirtier
diesel
cars
from
their
streets
but
scheuer
said
he
like
his
predecessor
alexander
dobrindt
who
was
often
accused
of
being
too
closely
tied
to
the
country
s
car
industry
opposed
any
move
in
that
direction
whether
it
s
blue
badges
light
blue
badges
he
said
badges
are
the
wrong
method
i
reject
their
introduction
like
my
predecessor
alexander
dobrindt
did
they
are
the
first
step
towards
driving
but
he
insisted
he
would
be
tough
with
carmakers
promising
new
very
very
serious
talks
with
carmakers
on
diesel
pollution
asked
whether
car
companies
would
be
forced
generally
to
retrofit
diesel
cars
he
said
he
expected
the
companies
to
cooperate
but
added
forcing
is
not
the
way
i
do
merkel
last
week
said
she
opposed
blanket
nationwide
schemes
to
restrict
diesels
adding
a
badge
scheme
would
let
off
the
hook
cities
that
should
instead
focus
on
finding
locally
appropriate
ways
of
improving
air
quality
for
instance
by
retrofitting
public
transport
vehicles
