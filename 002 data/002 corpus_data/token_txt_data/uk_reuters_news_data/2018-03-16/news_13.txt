the
most
likely
leftist
contender
in
brazil
s
presidential
race
ciro
gomes
is
warning
investors
to
hold
off
buying
state
assets
in
the
energy
sector
because
he
would
expropriate
them
if
he
wins
in
october
that
includes
rights
to
oil
fields
granted
last
year
and
a
legislative
push
to
dilute
state
control
of
centrais
eletricas
brasileiras
sa
or
eletrobras
the
country
s
largest
power
utility
what
i
want
to
say
is
don
t
buy
wait
a
bit
gomes
said
in
an
interview
on
thursday
in
which
the
former
governor
of
ceara
state
detailed
plans
to
raise
taxes
on
wealthy
brazilians
reduce
the
country
s
hefty
public
debt
and
change
the
central
bank
s
sole
focus
on
fighting
inflation
gomes
maintains
that
president
michel
temer
is
illegitimate
because
he
took
office
in
the
controversial
impeachment
of
leftist
dilma
rousseff
arguing
that
his
policies
should
be
revised
by
the
next
government
elected
by
the
brazilian
people
gomes
will
benefit
the
most
if
former
president
luiz
inacio
lula
da
silva
brazil
s
most
influential
politician
is
barred
from
running
due
to
a
corruption
conviction
a
datafolha
poll
in
january
showed
that
if
lula
can
not
run
gomes
would
have
percent
of
voter
intentions
in
a
field
led
by
candidate
jair
bolsonaro
with
percent
gomes
expects
to
at
least
double
his
standing
if
he
becomes
the
standard
bearer
of
the
left
and
hopes
to
win
the
backing
of
lula
s
workers
party
which
could
provide
his
running
mate
he
said
while
he
would
roll
back
many
of
temer
s
policies
gomes
said
he
was
no
juvenile
oil
companies
that
won
concessions
last
year
in
brazil
s
offshore
region
including
royal
dutch
shell
plc
exxon
mobil
corp
statoil
asa
and
total
sa
would
be
compensated
when
the
state
revokes
their
contracts
gomes
said
even
though
he
would
redirect
public
spending
to
boost
the
economy
and
reduce
social
inequality
gomes
vowed
he
would
be
fiscally
responsible
i
will
pay
the
debt
he
said
adding
that
it
would
take
several
governments
to
do
that
but
he
would
start
the
trend
if
elected
he
plans
to
levy
taxes
on
profits
and
dividends
while
increasing
inheritance
taxes
gomes
thinks
his
main
rival
will
be
candidate
geraldo
alckmin
the
governor
of
sao
paulo
however
gomes
said
he
would
relish
the
chance
to
face
bolsonaro
a
former
army
captain
whom
he
