is
considering
to
limit
the
price
of
credits
that
oil
refiners
must
acquire
to
comply
with
the
renewable
fuel
standard
let
there
be
no
doubt
the
consequences
of
a
waiver
would
be
severe
and
immediate
across
the
midwest
impacting
farmers
and
biofuel
stakeholders
alike
the
senators
wrote
the

by

trump
has
not
publicly
commented
on
his
plans
but
he
told
lawmakers
and
industry
officials
in
a
meeting
earlier
this
month
that
he
supported
capping
the
price
of
rfs
compliance
credits
known
as
rins
at
cents
each
according
to
a
source
who
attended
but
who
asked
not

the
credits
are
currently
trading
around
cents
each
having
fallen
nearly
percent
in
recent
weeks
amid
the
political
uncertainty
white
house
spokeswoman
kelly
love
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
in
the
meeting
this
month
trump
also
supported
expanding
sales
of
gasoline
a
tweak
by
ethanol
producers
according
to
the
source
the
environmental
protection
agency
bans
the
use
of
gasoline
containing
percent
ethanol
during
the
summer
months
a
measure
intended
to
reduce
ozone
emissions
and
smog
during
the
peak
driving
season
the
senators
along
with
the
biofuel
industry
like
the
idea
of
lifting
the
summer
ban
on
ethanol
blends
but
oppose
any
credit
price
caps
they
argue
the
proposed
caps
would
take
away
any
incentive
to
blend
higher
volumes
of
ethanol
grassley
took
to
twitter
on
thursday
night
and
friday
morning
to
oppose
the
rin
caps
