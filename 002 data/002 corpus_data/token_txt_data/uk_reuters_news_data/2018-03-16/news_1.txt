angola
s
ruling
mpla
party
said
on
friday
it
would
discuss
next
month
when
to
appoint
a
new
leader
potentially
undermining
party
chief
and
former
president
jose
eduardo
dos
santos
who
hours
earlier
said
he
might
stay
on
until
next
year
dos
santos
handpicked
angola
s
new
president
joão
lourenço
to
succeed
him
when
he
stepped
down
last
september
after
ruling
for
years
but
held
onto
his
position
as
head
of
the
party
creating
two
centres
of
power
in
the
nation
since
then
dos
santos
has
been
under
increasing
pressure
to
give
up
the
presidency
of
the
people
s
movement
for
the
liberation
of
angola
mpla
that
has
governed
angola
continuously
since
independence
from
portugal
in
state
radio
said
many
in
the
mpla
leadership
had
taken
issue
with
dos
santos
intervention
at
friday
s
meeting
of
the
central
committee
when
in
a
rare
public
statement
he
told
the
party
it
should
wait
until
december
or
april
to
replace
him
consensus
is
building
within
the
inner
circle
of
the
mpla
that
a
new
party
leader
should
be
appointed
as
early
as
june
the
radio
reported
in
a
statement
published
at
the
end
of
the
meeting
the
mpla
said
the
decision
to
discuss
the
issue
in
april
had
as
its
only
goal
the
strengthening
of
the
mpla
and
the
reinforcement
of
its
internal
cohesion
lourenço
has
moved
against
some
of
dos
santos
old
allies
and
has
removed
family
members
from
key
positions
including
his
daughter
isabel
from
the
chair
of
state
oil
company
sonangol
and
josé
filomeno
from
the
sovereign
wealth
fund
party
stalwarts
have
also
come
out
to
say
they
intended
to
ensure
dos
santos
sticks
to
previous
assurances
that
he
would
leave
active
political
life
in
after
a
flurry
of
rumours
on
social
media
suggesting
friday
s
central
committee
meeting
could
see
a
date
for
his
removal
forced
upon
him
dos
santos
moved
to
set
his
own
timeline
i
recommend
that
it
would
be
most
prudent
that
the
party
s
extraordinary
congress
which
will
resolve
the
question
of
the
leadership
of
the
mpla
be
in
december
or
april
he
told
the
central
committee
at
the
opening
of
the
meeting
as
head
of
the
party
dos
santos
remains
hugely
powerful
with
influence
over
the
way
lawmakers
vote
in
parliament
and
on
party
policy
proposals
but
relations
with
lourenço
have
broken
down
i
understand
that
the
relationship
has
deteriorated
since
late
and
that
they
are
no
longer
in
communication
with
each
other
said
alex
vines
head
of
the
africa
programme
at
london
s
chatham
house
a
transition
of
power
after
almost
years
was
never
going
to
be
simple
or
smooth
and
the
over
the
mpla
presidency
is
a
reminder
that
this
transition
is
still
in
its
infancy
