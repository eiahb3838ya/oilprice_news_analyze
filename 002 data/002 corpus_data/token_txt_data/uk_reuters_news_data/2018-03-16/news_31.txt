trader
trafigura
will
regain
its
position
as
the
largest
buyer
of
seaborne
crude
from
russia
s
rosneft
trading
sources
told
reuters
on
friday
expanding
their
partnership
as
rosneft
reduces
its
dealings
with
vitol
and
glencore
three
sources
told
reuters
that
trafigura
would
increase
its
dominance
in
rosneft
s
urals
oil
trading
from
april
when
rosneft
s
deal
with
vitol
and
glencore
expires
trafigura
will
be
the
lucky
one
a
trader
in
the
russian
crude
oil
market
said
rosneft
trafigura
glencore
and
vitol
all
declined
to
comment
trafigura
was
the
biggest
lifter
of
rosneft
crude
for
a
couple
of
years
from
when
the
companies
established
a
close
partnership
amid
western
sanctions
on
moscow
rosneft
s
boss
igor
sechin
is
a
close
ally
of
president
vladimir
putin
and
the
west
imposed
sanctions
on
the
kremlin
to
retaliate
against
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
but
trafigura
lost
a
large
portion
of
volumes
at
the
start
of
this
year
when
rosneft
transferred
volumes
it
was
previously
getting
in
the
pacific
to
its
new
shareholder
china
s
cefc
from
april
trafigura
will
be
able
to
recoup
the
volumes
lost
in
the
pacific
by
getting
more
urals
crude
on
the
baltic
it
will
see
volumes
rising
to
cargoes
in
april
from
russian
baltic
ports
from
five
in
previous
months
according
to
traders
the
development
became
possible
because
march
was
the
last
month
of
rosneft
s
supplies
to
vitol
and
glencore
under
a
deal
signed
in
shortly
before
western
sanctions
against
moscow
were
imposed
from
april
onwards
rosneft
will
have
some
tonnes
or
seven
cargoes
a
month
of
urals
volumes
available
for
sale
and
most
of
it
will
go
to
trafigura
the
sources
said
the
development
means
vitol
once
the
biggest
buyer
of
rosneft
s
oil
will
disappear
from
the
list
of
regular
buyers
of
rosneft
s
crude
as
it
doesn
t
have
new
deals
glencore
will
remain
a
large
buyer
as
it
secured
a
supply
deal
last
year
when
it
became
a
shareholder
in
rosneft
sharp
increases
in
urals
supplies
from
rosneft
could
make
trafigura
the
biggest
market
player
in
the
baltic
urals
market
from
next
month
