mexico
s
economy
minister
on
thursday
urged
officials
to
push
for
a
speedy
renegotiation
of
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
nafta
saying
his
country
and
canada
must
be
ready
to
go
it
alone
if
the
united
states
pulls
out
economy
minister
ildefonso
guajardo
said
if
no
deal
to
rework
nafta
could
be
struck
by
april
then
the
new
political
complexion
of
the
region
would
cast
doubt
on
how
incoming
lawmakers
would
view
it
in
mexico
and
the
united
states
the
whole
nature
of
the
agreement
would
change
guajardo
said
at
the
world
economic
forum
on
latin
america
in
sao
paulo
you
either
get
it
done
by
the
end
of
april
or
then
it
doesn
t
matter
you
can
go
until
the
end
of
the
guajardo
had
previously
identified
a
window
for
negotiation
extending
through
july
though
his
comments
come
a
few
days
after
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
floated
the
idea
of
reaching
a
deal
in
principle
in
the
next
few
weeks
the
regular
session
of
congress
in
mexico
ends
on
april
and
the
country
will
elect
a
new
president
in
july
who
takes
office
at
the
start
of
december
the
united
states
will
hold
congressional
elections
in
november
mexico
s
government
is
eager
to
broker
a
deal
before
a
change
of
presidency
and
guajardo
has
also
said
his
team
would
be
ready
to
keep
talking
until
the
end
of
november
speaking
with
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
the
event
guajardo
said
he
thought
it
was
probable
that
the
negotiations
would
drag
on
beyond
april
nonetheless
he
said
it
could
be
possible
to
complete
the
technical
work
in
a
month
if
there
s
political
will
and
flexibility
to
reach
an
agreement
i
think
it
s
technically
not
impossible
he
said
in
an
interview
guajardo
has
stressed
that
mexico
wants
to
keep
nafta
but
reiterated
that
both
mexico
and
canada
needed
to
be
ready
for
the
possibility
of
a
departure
you
have
to
be
ready
to
live
with
a
nafta
without
the
guajardo
said
nafta
at
risk
of
ending
no
nafta
will
continue
between
canada
and
mexico
because
at
the
end
of
the
day
what
is
important
is
you
send
a
message
that
you
believe
in
free
trade
the
is
the
one
that
will
decide
to
be
in
or
a
vast
majority
of
mexicans
remained
in
favor
of
free
trade
and
president
donald
trump
was
coming
under
increasing
pressure
from
political
supporters
in
farming
states
to
renew
the
trade
deal
the
mexican
minister
said
if
nafta
was
not
reworked
soon
terms
of
negotiation
could
be
shifted
by
political
developments
such
democrats
winning
control
of
the
senate
guajardo
said
he
noted
that
democrats
claimed
victory
this
week
in
a
special
congressional
election
in
pennsylvania
in
a
district
trump
had
won
in
the
vote
tally
officially
remains
too
close
to
call
speaking
at
a
fundraiser
in
the
state
of
missouri
on
wednesday
trump
reiterated
that
he
thought
it
best
to
kill
nafta
and
strike
a
new
deal
let
s
start
all
over
again
because
the
best
deal
is
to
terminate
it
and
then
make
a
new
deal
trump
said
according
to
a
transcript
published
by
the
washington
post
but
i
don
t
know
that
we
can
make
a
deal
because
mexico
is
so
spoiled
with
this
horrible
deal
that
they
ve
lived
nonetheless
trump
s
comments
appear
to
contradict
statements
made
by
his
newly
installed
director
of
the
white
house
national
economic
council
larry
kudlow
on
wednesday
kudlow
said
he
thought
nafta
needs
to
be
reupholstered
in
many
ways
but
ditching
it
would
have
bad
consequences
