sunpower likely to expand u.s. manufacturing as tariffs weigh
march
reuters
sunpower
corp
on
friday
said
it
was
strongly
considering
expanding
its
solar
panel
manufacturing
in
the
united
states
as
it
grapples
with
the
trump
administration
s
tariffs
on
solar
imports
the
news
came
as
the
company
filed
a
request
to
exempt
some
of
its
panels
from
the
new
percent
tariffs
in
the
filing
sunpower
argued
that
its
highly
efficient
solar
panels
can
not
be
compared
with
the
more
conventional
models
that
dominate
the
market
in
an
interview
chief
executive
tom
werner
said
it
was
not
seeking
an
exemption
for
its
less
efficient
and
expensive
panels
and
would
likely
set
up
a
new
manufacturing
plant
for
that
product
an
exclusion
of
its
other
products
from
the
tariffs
just
makes
it
far
easier
to
make
that
investment
