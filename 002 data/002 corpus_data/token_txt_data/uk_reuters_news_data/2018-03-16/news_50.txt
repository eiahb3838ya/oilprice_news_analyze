dead
end

low
growth
trap
it
is
a
shovel
to
dig
it
much
deeper

sydney
we

it
embrace
free
trade
not
retreat
from
it
turnbull
said
on
day
one
of
the
summit
the
comments
come
as
market
sentiment
sours
with
signs
of
a
looming
trade

between
the
united
states
china
and
europe
over
president
donald
trump

of
chinese
imports
targeting
technology
and
telecommunications
sectors
i
know
the
global
mood
may
be
heading
in
the
opposite
direction
but
within
asean
we
are
working
to
deepen
and
deepen
interdependence
to
work
together
to
open
up
markets
singapore
prime
minister
lee
hsien
loong
said
australia
is
hosting
the
asean
meeting
despite
not
being
a
member
of
the
bloc
as
it
seeks
to
deepen
political
and
trade
ties
in
the
face
of
china
s
rising
influence
trade
is
a
central
topic
of
the
meeting
though
human
rights
and
chinese
assertiveness
are
set
to
dominate
talks
between
australia
and
asean
countries
australian
foreign
minister
julie
bishop
said
she
would
raise
human
rights
concerns
with
leaders
in
myanmar
which
has
been
criticized
for
its
crackdown
on
rohingya
muslims
and
cambodia
which
has
dissolved
the
main
opposition
party
and
jailed
government
critics
asked
whether
the
asean
meeting
was
a
direct
counter
to
china
s
growing
interest
in
the
region
bishop
said
australia
believed
the
bloc
brought
it
peace
stability
and
security
we
don
t
see
it
as
having
a
role
to
balance
the
powers
in
the
but
rather
be
at
the
heart
of
the
engagement
collaboration
with
other
countries
she
told
australian
broadcasting
corp
radio
china
claims
most
of
the
south
china
sea
an
important
trade
route
which
is
believed
to
contain
large
quantities
of
oil
and
natural
gas
and

been
building
artificial

on
reefs
some
with
ports
and

strips
brunei
malaysia
vietnam
the
philippines
all
of
which
are
members
of
asean
and
taiwan
also
have
claims
in
the
sea
lee
acknowledged
china
s
rise
had
stoked
divisions
within
asean
there
is
a
shift
in
the
global
strategic
balance
chinese
influence
is
growing
with
its
economy
and
strength
and
its
interest
in
the
region
and
beyond
he
said
there
is
a
range
of
different
perspectives
and
responses
to
this
shift

maritime
patrols
in
the
south
china
sea
among
efforts
to
improve
regional
security
although
several
asean
countries
already
conduct
joint
exercises
other
member
nations
oppose
such
operations
making
a
consensus
at
the
summit
difficult
the
inclusion
of
myanmar
leader
aung
san
suu
kyi
and
cambodian
prime

large

are
planned
against
both
crimes
verging
on
genocide
were
being
committed
against
the
rohingya
minority
in
myanmar
and
those
crimes
bore
the
fingerprints
of
the
myanmar
government
and
of
the
international
community

united
nations
special
adviser
on
the
prevention
of
genocide

crackdown
led
by
security
forces
in
western
rakhine
state
that
the
united
nations
and
united
states
have
said
constitute
ethnic
cleansing
it
is
in
our
interest
to
engage
all
asean
members
including
aung
san
suu
kyi
at
this
summit
because
it
gives
us
the
best
chance
of
influencing
outcomes
and
making
our
concerns
known
so
these
are
matters
that
we
would
be
discussing
with
the
myanmar
delegation

western
nations
and
rights
groups

him
in
sydney
saying
i
will
follow
you
all
the
way
to
your
doorstep
and
beat
you
right
there
i
can
use
