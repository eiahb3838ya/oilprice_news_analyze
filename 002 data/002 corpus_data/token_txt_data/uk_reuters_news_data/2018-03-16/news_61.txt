amnesty
international
on
friday
accused
international
oil
majors
shell
and
eni
of
negligence
when
addressing
spills
in
nigeria
describing
their
actions
as
serious
negligence
amnesty
said
the
companies
were
taking
weeks
to
respond
to
reports
of
spills
and
publishing
misleading
information
about
the
cause
and
severity
of
spills
which
may
result
in
communities
not
receiving
compensation
a
shell
spokesman
said
amnesty
s
allegations
are
false
without
merit
and
fail
to
recognise
the
complex
environment
in
which
the
company
operates
eni
declined
immediate
comment
shell
and
eni
have
for
decades
been
two
of
the
most
active
oil
majors
operating
in
the
niger
delta
region
nigeria
s
heartland
is
an
ecological
disaster
zone
scarred
by
decades
of
spills
that
have
killed
trees
and
other
plants
yet
and
the
associated
compensation
are
highly
contentious
with
some
local
communities
even
blocking
teams
access
to
spill
sites
allowing
the
damage
to
worsen
in
the
hope
of
extracting
a
bigger
under
nigerian
law
companies
must
visit
sites
within
hours
of
reporting
a
spill
amnesty
said
that
in
one
case
italian
eni
took
more
than
a
year
to
respond
to
a
spill
in
bayelsa
state
while
oil
companies
frequently
attribute
spills
to
sabotage
and
theft
locals
say
they
are
often
due
to
other
issues
such
as
corrosion
shell
has
reported
spills
since
and
eni
since
according
to
amnesty
which
said
among
those
reports
it
found
about
which
there
are
reasonable
doubts
surrounding
the
cause
provided
by
the
oil
companies
in
the
bodo
community
and
a
british
law
firm
negotiated
a
million
pound
pollution
settlement
with
shell
in
the
natural
resource
governance
institute
a
group
that
advises
countries
on
how
to
manage
oil
gas
and
mineral
resources
acknowledged
there
were
sometimes
difficulties
on
both
sides
there
s
no
good
guy
here
everybody
s
kind
of
bad
i
m
sure
the
companies
don
t
do
all
that
they
can
to
get
to
these
places
but
then
they
also
have
genuine
grievances
and
genuine
difficulties
dealing
with
these
communities
