update 2-sunpower seeks tariff waiver, cites plan for u.s. expansion
reuters
sunpower
corp
on
friday
asked
the
trump
administration
to
exempt
a
segment
of
its
solar
panel
imports
from
new
tariffs
saying
the
move
would
allow
it
to
reverse
proposed
investment
cuts
and
ease
plans
to
expand
panel
manufacturing
the
request
by
sunpower
which
is
majority
owned
by
france
s
total
sa
marks
the
first
attempt
by
a
major
solar
company
to
sidestep
a
controversial
percent
levy
on
imported
panels
announced
by
president
donald
trump
in
january
trump
had
said
the
tariff
would
boost
manufacturing
but
many
in
the
industry
have
warned
of
higher
costs
and
thousands
of
layoffs
in
the
installation
end
of
the
solar
industry
we
understand
the
administration
s
goals
sunpower
chief
executive
tom
werner
said
in
an
interview
we
think
we
can
contribute
positively
to
those
the
white
house
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
it
could
not
determined
which
other
companies
had
filed
such
requests
with
the
trade
representative
by
the
deadline
on
friday
sunpower
s
request
covers
only
its
imported
premium
panels
and
not
the
less
efficient
and
cheaper
panels
which
dominate
the
market
werner
said
san
jose
sunpower
manufactures
most
of
its
panels
in
the
philippines
and
mexico
werner
said
an
exemption
would
allow
sunpower
to
materially
reverse
a
decision
made
immediately
after
the
tariff
announcement
in
january
to
cancel
a
million
investment
in
its
cell
technology
that
would
have
created
hundreds
of
jobs
in
california
and
texas
sunpower
last
month
said
the
tariff
would
force
it
to
cut
to
jobs
the
cheaper
panels
could
be
made
at
a
new
facility
that
the
company
would
build
probably
in
the
southwest
werner
said
noting
that
sunpower
was
in
the
process
of
narrowing
down
its
options
to
two
locations
this
is
not
hypothetical
we
re
ready
to
make
this
happen
he
said
adding
that
an
exemption
for
premium
panel
imports
would
facilitate
this
plan
a
big
investment
in
solar
panel
manufacturing
as
a
result
of
the
tariff
would
mark
a
win
for
the
trump
administration
but
so
far
the
industry
remains
focused
on
the
fate
of
the
installation
business
which
employs
tens
of
thousands
of
people
only
china
s
jinkosolar
has
said
it
plans
to
build
a
manufacturing
facility
and
solarworld
one
of
the
panel
producers
behind
the
trade
case
that
resulted
in
the
tariffs
has
said
it
will
hire
employees
this
year
suniva
the
bankrupt
company
that
first
petitioned
the
administration
in
april
to
impose
tariffs
has
not
publicly
outlined
its
plans
the
exemption
request
will
undergo
a
comment
period
before
the
trade
representative
makes
a
decision
