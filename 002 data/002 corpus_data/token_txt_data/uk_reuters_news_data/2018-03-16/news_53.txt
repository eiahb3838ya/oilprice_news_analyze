r
esearchers
backed
by
dollar
grants
from
nasa
are
heading
to
southeast
asia
s
mekong
river
region
to
find
ways
to
improve
dams
so
they
are
less
harmful
to
people
and
the
environment
researchers
from
michigan
state
university
msu
will
spend
three
years
analyzing
sites
in
the
lower
mekong
river
basin
in
thailand
cambodia
and
vietnam
the
project
will
be
funded
by
two
grants
from
the
united
states
space
agency
nasa
totaling
million
and
the
researchers
hope
their
findings
will
improve
dams
around
the
world
the
most
egregious
affects
of
dam
building
are
displacement
and
relocation
said
daniel
kramer
a
professor
of
fisheries
and
wildlife
at
msu
but
the
research
that
we
re
doing
is
also
suggesting
that
there
are
a
lot
of
less
obvious
things
that
the
effects
of
dams
bring
on
local
people
and
ecosystems
kramer
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
there
are
concerns
for
example
about
damage
to
farming
and
fisheries
due
to
dam
projects
along
the
lower
mekong
which
is
the
world
s
largest
freshwater
fishery
and
home
to
million
people
the
environmental
impact
of
dams
may
drastically
change
the
economies
and
social
structures
of
communities
kramer
added
dam
building
is
experiencing
a
resurgence
around
the
world
with
many
projects
backed
by
chinese
funding
as
more
countries
look
for
affordable
way
to
generate
energy
for
their
growing
populations
most
mekong
countries
especially
china
have
been
planning
and
building
hydropower
dams
since
the
late
but
an
uptick
in
dam
projects
began
about
years
ago
the
mekong
river
s
mainstream
now
has
about
dams
and
more
than
on
its
tributaries
said
jiaguo
qi
professor
of
geography
at
msu
the
msu
researchers
will
analyze
how
dams
impact
the
flow
of
rivers
local
agriculture
fisheries
irrigations
systems
and
wetland
ecosystems
said
qi
as
well
as
analyzing
satellite
imagery
researchers
will
develop
models
to
simulate
historical
water
flows
and
project
how
those
flows
may
change
as
a
result
of
dam
construction
and
shrinking
glaciers
in
the
himalayan
headwaters
interviews
will
also
be
conducted
with
local
residents
to
find
out
how
communities
that
surround
or
are
downstream
from
dams
cope
with
the
loss
of
wetlands
and
fisheries
and
what
the
economic
benefits
are
the
research
team
will
regularly
produce
papers
and
hold
workshops
throughout
the
period
with
the
final
report
available
to
the
general
public
it
is
hoped
that
the
research
will
be
used
to
make
existing
dams
and
those
still
in
the
planning
stage
to
become
more
sustainable
qi
added
while
some
preliminary
research
has
already
begun
the
field
work
for
the
project
will
begin
in
may
