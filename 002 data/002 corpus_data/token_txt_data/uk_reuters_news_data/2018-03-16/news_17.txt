saudi
arabia
and
its
adversaries
in
yemen
s
armed
houthi
movement
are
holding
secret
talks
to
try
to
end
a
war
that
has
unleashed
the
world
s
worst
humanitarian
crisis
diplomats
and
yemeni
political
sources
said
a
coalition
is
fighting
to
counter
the
influence
of
riyadh
s
iran
an
ally
of
the
houthis
who
deny
any
help
from
tehran
and
say
they
are
fighting
a
revolution
against
corrupt
politicians
and
gulf
powers
in
thrall
to
the
west
speaking
to
reuters
on
condition
of
anonymity
two
diplomats
and
two
yemeni
officials
said
the
houthi
spokesman
mohammed
had
been
in
direct
communication
with
saudi
officials
in
oman
on
a
comprehensive
solution
to
the
conflict
there
are
consultations
between
the
houthis
and
the
saudis
without
a
representative
of
the
internationally
recognised
government
and
it
is
clear
that
there
is
a
desire
of
the
houthis
and
the
coalition
to
go
towards
a
comprehensive
agreement
one
diplomat
told
reuters
a
coalition
official
denied
that
saudi
arabia
had
any
negotiations
with
the
houthis
and
reaffirmed
support
in
a
statement
to
reuters
for
peace
efforts
aimed
at
reaching
a
political
solution
houthi
officials
did
not
provide
an
official
comment
hailing
from
yemen
s
zaydi
shi
ite
sect
the
houthis
seized
the
capital
sanaa
and
drove
the
internationally
recognised
government
of
president
mansour
hadi
into
saudi
exile
fearing
the
advance
was
part
of
a
regional
power
grab
by
tehran
riyadh
and
other
mostly
sunni
muslim
gulf
arab
states
armed
and
supported
by
the
united
states
and
britain
intervened
to
restore
his
rule
the
accord
would
begin
with
a
truce
to
pause
fighting
on
nationwide
battlefronts
and
culminate
in
the
signing
of
a
peace
deal
addressing
the
political
interests
of
the
warring
parties
the
sources
added
thousands
of
air
strikes
have
killed
hundreds
of
yemeni
civilians
while
rocket
attacks
on
saudi
arabia
have
led
to
hundreds
of
casualties
coalition
forces
have
made
modest
territorial
gains
but
appear
far
from
seizing
back
the
capital
from
seasoned
houthi
fighters
with
no
victory
in
sight
and
as
the
war
pushes
the
country
towards
famine
saudi
officials
including
the
powerful
crown
prince
and
defence
minister
mohammed
bin
salman
have
expressed
a
desire
to
wrap
up
the
conflict
diplomats
said
the
dialogue
had
been
going
on
for
about
two
months
and
appeared
aimed
at
providing
a
framework
for
a
resolution
to
coincide
with
the
arrival
of
a
new
envoy
to
yemen
former
british
diplomat
martin
griffiths
who
began
his
term
on
sunday
but
it
was
not
immediately
clear
how
much
progress
had
been
achieved
peace
talks
between
the
houthis
and
the
yemeni
government
were
last
held
in
kuwait
in
august
that
round
of
dialogue
and
two
previous
ones
in
switzerland
where
there
was
no
saudi
presence
ended
without
success
the
current
talks
appear
to
have
bypassed
yemen
s
government
whose
restoration
was
the
justification
for
the
intervention
underlining
a
series
of
deepening
yemeni
squabbles
which
have
hobbled
the
coalition
war
effort
two
hadi
government
officials
contacted
by
reuters
were
unaware
of
the
dialogue
and
their
criticism
of
the
coalition
has
mounted
in
recent
days
accusing
them
of
barring
hadi
and
other
officials
from
returning
to
the
country
hadi
has
mostly
resided
in
riyadh
while
areas
in
yemen
experienced
a
series
of
deadly
attacks
by
islamic
state
militants
he
last
visited
in
february
