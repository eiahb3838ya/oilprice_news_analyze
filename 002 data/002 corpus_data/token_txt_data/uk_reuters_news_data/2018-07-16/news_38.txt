china
s
steel
mills
churned
out
record
amounts
of
the
construction
material
in
june
as
producers
rushed
to
cash
in
on
hefty
margins
even
as
a
trade
spat
between
beijing
and
washington
intensified
china
which
accounts
for
half
the
world
s
capacity
produced
million
tonnes
of
crude
steel
last
month
national
bureau
of
statistics
data
showed
on
friday
that
s
just
shy
of
the
million
tonnes
the
united
states
produced
in
the
whole
of
according
to
world
steel
association
data
june
output
was
below
may
s
record
million
tonnes
but
june
has
one
less
day
setting
a
new
daily
average
production
record
for
a
third
month
in
a
row
at
million
tonnes
according
to
reuters
calculations
steel
mills
were
dashing
to
reap
as
much
of
the
bumper
profits
as
they
could
despite
environmental
checks
said
richard
lu
analyst
at
cru
in
beijing
the
data
may
further
inflame
a
bitter
trade
row
the
united
states
and
europe
have
accused
china
of
exporting
its
surplus
metal
cheap
hurting
international
rivals
china
s
steel
exports
rose
last
month
to
million
tonnes
their
highest
since
july
even
after
washington
imposed
import
duties
to
protect
industries
the
production
increase
also
comes
as
china
has
shuttered
some
mills
to
help
curb
choking
pollution
and
ramped
up
environmental
inspections
suggesting
that
newer
mills
have
ramped
up
operations
to
cash
in
on
fat
margins
china
s
steel
output
in
the
first
half
rose
percent
to
million
tonnes
steel
prices
have
soared
over
the
past
year
due
to
firm
demand
and
on
concerns
about
tightening
supplies
of
metal
used
in
construction
and
automotives
as
beijing
seeks
to
close
inefficient
mills
and
clamps
down
on
industries
to
clean
the
nation
s
skies
lu
estimated
that
mills
were
earning
a
profit
margin
of
about
yuan
per
tonne
of
steel
while
analysts
at
huatai
futures
put
profit
margins
for
mills
in
northern
china
at
over
yuan
a
tonne
one
of
the
highest
on
record
monthly
utilisation
rates
at
mills
reached
percent
in
june
the
highest
since
october
before
winter
production
curbs
had
taken
effect
according
to
reuters
calculation
based
on
data
from
mysteel
consultancy
analysts
say
it
s
not
clear
if
china
will
continue
its
run
some
particularly
smoggy
cities
and
provinces
are
also
implementing
ad
hoc
measures
to
beat
bouts
of
pollution
last
week
top
steelmaking
city
tangshan
ordered
mills
to
cut
production
for
weeks
over
summer
steel
output
may
not
necessarily
go
down
even
though
stricter
restrictions
are
on
the
way
said
lu
steel
mills
in
xuzhou
city
could
reopen
soon
which
will
to
some
extent
offset
the
production
curbs
in
producers
are
also
racing
to
make
as
much
metal
as
possible
before
a
new
round
of
production
curbs
are
imposed
in
november
ahead
of
china
s
winter
when
pollution
is
at
its
worst
last
winter
government
forced
mills
and
heavy
industry
in
of
the
most
polluted
northern
cities
to
shut
up
to
half
of
their
capacity
between
november
and
march
more
are
expected
to
adopt
similar
curbs
this
winter
