mnuchin
said
washington
had
made
clear
to
allies
that
it
expects
them
to
enforce
the
sanctions
against
iran
but
if
there
are
specific
situations
we
re
open
to
french

according
to
le
figaro
paris
had
singled
out
key
areas
where
it
expected
either
exemptions
or
extended
periods
for
french
companies
including
energy
banking
pharmaceuticals
and
automotive
the
trump
administration
has
said
there
are
more
than
foreign
companies
that
have

one
country
he
did
not
name
the
country
he
had
not
yet
consulted
what
they
ve
asked
us
to
do
is
review
how
we

there
and
the
timeline
for

so
i
m
very
confident
they
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
speaking
in
remarks
carried
live
on
state
television
on
saturday
said
washington
was
more
isolated
than
ever
over
sanctions
against
iran
even
among
its
allies
his
comments
appeared
to
be
trying
to
ease
popular
concerns
fueled
by
trump
s
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
deal
with
iran
on
its
nuclear
program
the
likely
return
of
economic
sanctions
has
triggered
a
rapid
fall
of
iran
s
currency
and
protests
by
bazaar
traders
usually
loyal
to
the
islamist
rulers
trump
has
said
he
asked
saudi
arabia
to
raise
oil
production
if
needed
to
ensure
global
oil
supplies
and
the
country
has
million
barrels
per
day
of
spare
capacity
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
agreed
with
russia
and
other
allies
on
june
to
raise
output
from
july
with
saudi
arabia
pledging
a
measurable
supply
boost
but
giving
no
specific
numbers
