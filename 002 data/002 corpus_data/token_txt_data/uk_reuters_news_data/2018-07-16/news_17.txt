oslo
reuters
a
strike
by
norwegian
offshore
oil
and
gas
workers
accelerated
on
monday
when
hundreds
more
walked
out
in
a
dispute
over
pay
and
pensions
after
employers
failed
to
respond
to
union
demands
for
a
new
offer
the
strike
which
began
last
tuesday
has
had
a
limited
impact
on
norway
s
oil
production
so
far
but
some
drillers
warned
of
possible
contract
cancellations
if
the
dispute
goes
on
for
a
month
or
more
a
further
workers
went
on
strike
on
monday
joining
almost
who
walked
out
last
week
and
the
safe
union
said
it
would
consider
in
the
next
few
days
whether
to
widen
the
strike
to
all
of
its
members
safe
went
ahead
with
its
plan
to
expand
the
strike
after
employers
did
not
respond
to
its
demands
for
higher
wages
and
pension
benefits
by
a
midnight
gmt
sunday
deadline
the
expanded
strike
was
not
expected
to
have
any
immediate
extra
impact
on
oil
or
gas
production
beyond
the
closure
last
week
of
shell
s
knarr
field
which
produces
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
norway
s
biggest
oil
producer
equinor
said
it
did
not
expect
its
output
to
be
affected
in
the
short
term
due
to
the
escalation
of
the
strike
more
drilling
and
well
operations
are
affected
we
will
get
delays
in
the
short
term
we
do
not
see
any
production
or
milestone
consequences
said
equinor
spokesman
eskil
eriksen
he
declined
to
comment
on
what
the
company
considered
short
term
and
what
the
consequences
would
be
it
is
the
biggest
strike
in
norway
s
oil
sector
since
but
has
involved
a
relatively
small
number
of
workers
norway
s
oil
industry
directly
employed
workers
in
around
half
of
whom
worked
in
production
according
to
statistics
norway
there
has
been
no
contact
between
employers
and
the
union
since
the
strike
began
last
tuesday
after
safe
rejected
a
proposed
wage
and
pension
deal
employers
represented
by
the
norwegian
shipowners
association
said
on
monday
that
the
union
lacked
understanding
of
the
economic
reality
of
the
norwegian
continental
shelf
it
is
utterly
incomprehensible
that
safe
is
willing
to
put
at
risk
jobs
the
shelf
s
attractiveness
and
competitiveness
and
norway
s
reputation
as
a
safe
and
stable
supplier
of
oil
and
gas
resources
lead
negotiator
jacob
korsgaard
said
in
a
statement
korsgaard
told
reuters
he
did
not
plan
further
talks
with
the
union
this
week
after
saying
on
saturday
that
a
dispute
like
this
could
not
go
on
indefinitely
and
that
employers
were
considering
counter
measures
reidun
ravndal
a
member
of
safe
s
strike
committee
said
that
while
additional
workers
were
joining
the
strike
on
monday
it
would
take
some
time
for
the
strike
to
become
fully
effective
because
they
have
to
follow
safe
shutdown
procedures
one
of
the
drilling
companies
affected
odfjell
drilling
warned
of
financial
losses
and
of
contract
cancellations
if
the
strike
lasts
a
long
time
there
will
be
a
financial
loss
yes
we
have
mechanisms
in
the
contracts
to
compensate
but
if
it
lasts
a
long
time
consequences
will
be
serious
ceo
simen
lieungh
told
reuters
without
specifying
a
time
span
contracts
could
be
terminated
he
said
mentioning
contracts
with
equinor
and
aker
bp
contract
terminations
is
a
concern
for
other
drillers
too
according
to
lead
negotiator
jacob
korsgaard
it
is
a
real
concern
that
increases
every
day
he
told
reuters
asked
whether
the
strike
could
lead
to
contract
cancellations
if
it
were
to
last
more
than
a
month
he
said
last
week
aker
bp
said
a
prolonged
strike
could
postpone
output
from
some
of
the
wells
it
was
planning
to
drill
at
its
valhall
field
which
it
expected
to
put
in
production
later
in
the
year
the
employees
joining
the
action
work
on
exploration
and
production
drilling
rigs
owned
by
saipem
transocean
songa
offshore
odfjell
drilling
archer
and
cosl
among
others
asked
whether
the
strike
might
be
widened
to
the
remaining
drilling
workers
that
belong
to
the
union
ravndal
of
the
safe
union
told
reuters
we
will
have
this
discussion
in
the
next
