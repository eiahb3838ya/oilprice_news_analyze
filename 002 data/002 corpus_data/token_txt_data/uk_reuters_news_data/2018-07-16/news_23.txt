global
regulators
have
published
a
framework
for
vigilantly
monitoring
risks
from
crypto
assets
like
bitcoin
and
ether
even
though
they
don
t
pose
a
major
risk
to
financial
stability
for
now
wild
swings
in
crypto
asset
prices
have
prompted
central
bankers
to
warn
investors
they
could
lose
every
penny
it
is
unclear
at
times
which
financial
rules
if
any
apply
to
the
sector
or
if
there
is
legal
authority
to
regulate
it
start
ups
have
begun
issuing
new
digital
currencies
via
initial
coin
offerings
icos
raising
concern
among
regulators
over
investor
protection
the
aim
of
the
new
framework
is
to
spot
any
financial
stability
risks
early
enough
to
take
action
the
financial
stability
board
fsb
which
coordinates
financial
regulation
for
the
group
of
economies
said
the
framework
focuses
on
how
risks
from
crypto
asset
markets
could
spread
to
other
parts
of
the
financial
system
monitoring
the
size
and
growth
of
markets
is
critical
to
understanding
the
potential
size
of
wealth
effects
should
valuations
fall
the
fsb
said
in
a
statement
on
monday
the
use
of
leverage
and
financial
institution
exposures
to
markets
are
important
metrics
of
transmission
of
risks
to
the
broader
financial
the
aim
of
the
new
framework
is
to
spot
any
financial
stability
risks
early
enough
to
take
action
but
the
fsb
cautioned
that
data
is
still
patchy
at
times
in
a
rapidly
developing
market
that
can
be
fragmented
and
opaque
it
would
assess
whether
the
framework
will
need
extra
data
at
a
later
stage
moves
to
formally
monitor
the
sector
forms
part
of
a
compromise
in
march
between
members
like
france
who
wanted
more
radical
action
and
other
countries
who
preferred
treading
lightly
for
now
the
fsb
framework
also
includes
trading
volumes
pricing
clearing
and
margining
for
derivatives
linked
to
crypto
assets
such
as
the
bitcoin
futures
launched
by
cme
group
last
december
crypto
assets
in
general
and
crypto
asset
trading
platforms
do
not
pose
global
financial
stability
risks
but
they
raise
other
significant
concerns
including
consumer
and
investor
protection
market
integrity
and
money
financing
the
fsb
said
it
said
its
affiliate
the
basel
committee
which
writes
bank
capital
standards
is
conducting
an
initial
stocktake
of
banks
exposures
to
crypto
assets
the
committee
is
also
looking
at
whether
regulators
are
forcing
lenders
to
set
aside
capital
against
holdings
of
crypto
assets
and
considering
whether
to
rewrite
its
rules
to
explicitly
require
such
holdings
to
be
covered
