asian
shares
fell
on
monday
as
new
data
showed
china
s
economy
slowed
slightly
in
the
second
quarter
compounded
by
fears
of
a
trade
war
looming
over
markets
official
data
showed
china
s
economy
grew
percent
in
the
second
quarter
of
cooling
from
the
percent
growth
registered
in
each
of
the
previous
three
quarters
while
the
gdp
figures
were
in
line
with
market
expectations
the
new
data
also
showed
growth
in
china
s
industrial
output
pointing
to
slowing
momentum
and
prompting
some
analysts
to
call
for
stronger
government
measures
to
support
growth
taken
together
the
data
show
an
economy
continuing
to
slow
under
the
influence
of
a
crackdown
on
excessive
financial
risk
even
as
trade
war
headwinds
gather
but
jim
mccafferty
head
of
equity
research
asia
at
nomura
said
china
s
underlying
economic
data
appears
to
be
quite
robust
i
would
be
incredulous
if
china
s
gdp
growth
could
continue
at
the
level
it
s
been
historically
so
i
think
there
s
always
been
an
anticipation
of
some
gradual
slowdown
but
the
slowdown
of
the
growth
rate
is
probably
less
than
the
market
really
wants
to
believe
he
said
he
said
concerns
over
the
trade
war
were
dragging
down
markets
with
investors
spooked
by
the
ratcheting
up
of
trade
war
tensions
that
s
why
i
think
markets
are
nervous
because
there
s
no
precedent
for
this
type
of
behaviour
he
said
after
briefly
moving
higher
on
early

the
soft
china
data
undermined
a
boost
to
sentiment
from
friday
s
gains
on
wall

which
were
underpinned
by
strong
profits
from
industrial
and
energy
firms

been
in
a
holding
pattern
in
recent
days
thanks
in
part
to
a
lull
in

skirmishing

also
been
awaiting
the
china
data
and
are
still
looking
to
