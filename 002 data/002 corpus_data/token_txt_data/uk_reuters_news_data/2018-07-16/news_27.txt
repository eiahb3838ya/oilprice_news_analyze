china
will
levy
extra
tariffs
on
sugar
imports
from
all
origins
starting
from
the
commerce
ministry
said
on
monday
just
over
a
year
after
introducing
hefty
penalties
on
top
growers
including
brazil
and
thailand
in
may
last
year
the
government
hit
major
exporting
nations
with
penalties
on
sugar
shipments
after
years
of
lobbying
by
domestic
mills
it
still
exempted
smaller
producing
countries
and
regions
mostly
in
southeast
asia
and
south
america
like
in
the
philippines
and
el
salvador
that
list
of
exempt
countries
has
now
been
cancelled
the
commerce
ministry
said
in
a
monday
statement
protective
measures
will
be
uniformly
applied
to
all
sugar
imports
it
said
china
allows
million
tonnes
of
sugar
imports
a
year
at
a
tariff
of
percent
as
part
of
its
commitments
to
the
world
trade
organization
shipments
outside
of
that
allowance
imports
are
charged
a
higher
tariff
and
need
special
permits
pressured
by
a
large
global
surplus
and
rising
domestic
production
chinese
sugar
prices
have
plunged
this
year
pushing
most
producers
into
the
red
and
threatening
china
s
efforts
to
support
millions
of
small
farmers
in
the
poor
southern
region
of
guangxi
and
neighbouring
yunnan
province
industry
officials
recently
called
on
the
government
to
tighten
supplies
from
international
markets
amid
rising
worries
that
large
global
stocks
would
lead
to
more
smuggling
into
china
still
china
s
move
came
as
a
surprise
to
most
traders
who
had
not
expected
a
rapid
response
from
the
government
we
expected
them
to
take
action
but
not
so
fast
said
a
sugar
trader
with
an
international
trading
house
based
in
shanghai
chinese
white
sugar
futures
touched
a
low
of
yuan
per
tonne
last
week
a
level
not
seen
since
and
they
are
currently
hovering
at
a
low
production
costs
though
are
as
much
as
yuan
a
tonne
for
many
mills
according
to
the
trader
with
the
international
house
the
new
tariffs
will
have
limited
benefit
to
the
domestic
market
this
year
said
liu
hande
president
of
processor
and
trading
company
guangdong
zhongqing
sugar
group
co
china
has
already
bought
up
much
of
the
sweetener
available
from
countries
that
had
been
on
the
exempt
list
he
said
but
added
that
the
tariffs
should
support
prices
from
next
year
imports
already
incur
a
percent
levy
and
the
protective
measures
added
an
extra
percent
duty
to
those
imports
last
year
taking
the
total
to
percent
this
was
set
to
fall
to
percent
this
year
and
percent
next
year
chinese
importers
sharply
cut
shipments
from
top
supplier
brazil
after
the
tariffs
were
introduced
last
year
they
also
boosted
shipments
from
smaller
producers
some
of
which
exported
to
china
for
the
first
time
under
the
new
measures
china
could
return
to
buying
more
from
brazil
said
the
trader
as
it
still
needs
a
certain
volume
of
imports
to
meet
demand
each
year
