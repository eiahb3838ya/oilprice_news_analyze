the
chief
executive
of
qatar
airways
said
the
airline
was
adapting
to
a
regional
blockade
that
has
prevented
it
flying
some
routes
and
that
those
restrictions
would
not
necessarily
push
it
into
the
red
for
the
current
financial
year
there
is
a
possibility
that
we
will
post
also
a
loss
in
our
current
financial
year
but
it
s
only
a
possibly
chief
executive
akbar
told
reporters
at
the
farnborough
airshow
on
monday
the
restrictions
mean
the
company
is
set
to
post
a
loss
for
the
financial
year
ended
march
but
the
results
have
not
been
published
yet
said
these
would
be
made
public
in
the
coming
weeks
he
also
said
the
airline
was
only
moderately
hedged
on
fuel
and
may
need
to
hedge
more
in
future
as
the
price
of
oil
rises
