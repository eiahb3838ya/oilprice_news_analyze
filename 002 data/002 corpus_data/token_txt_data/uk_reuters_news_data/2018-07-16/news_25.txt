european
stock
markets
struggled
on
monday
as
expectations
for
a
flurry
of
bumper
corporate
earnings
and
merger
speculation
fought
with
fears
about
the
escalating
trade
conflict
between
beijing
and
washington
data
showing
china
s
economy
and
factory
production
growth
had
slowed
sent
asian
markets
lower
at
the
start
of
the
week
as
investors
fret
an
escalating
trade
battle
between
china
and
the
united
states
may
soon
start
to
damage
the
real
economy
european
shares
which
have
rallied
off
lows
in
july
mostly
opened
higher
although
the
gains
were
limited
and
temporary
germany
s
dax
was
the
biggest
riser
up
as
much
as
half
a
percent
before
settling
up
percent
france
s
cac
traded
down
percent
and
the
stoxx
was
percent
lower
basic
resources
and
autos
were
among
the
sectors
as
both
rely
on
solid
chinese
growth
merger
speculation
concerning
industrials
helped
outweigh
the
chinese
data
the
msci
world
equity
index
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
was
flat
on
the
day
the
numbers
were
not
way
out
of
line
and
slower
activity
numbers
were
kind
of
priced
in
said
ian
williams
a
strategist
at
peel
hunt
despite
all
the
noise
around
china
and
trump
you
are
going
to
get
a
real
indication
of
macroeconomic
health
much
more
from
company
management
i
suspect
that
s
what
the
focus
will
be
for
the
next
two
to
three
fears
of
a
broader
and
deeper
trade
conflict
have
kept
markets
edgy
for
months
now
but
the
selloffs
have
been
because
most
investors
are
confident
that
the
dispute
will
blow
over
and
that
robust
global
economic
growth
is
here
to
stay
with
dozens
of
european
and
companies
reporting
their
numbers
this
week
investors
will
be
looking
for
any
warnings
that
the
trade
battle
is
hurting
corporate
projections
jp
morgan
equity
strategist
mislav
matejka
said
earnings
results
in
both
the
and
europe
would
likely
be
strong
beating
expectations
by
a
good
percent
he
noted
that
trade
headlines
might
be
losing
some
of
the
shock
value
as
many
investors
now
expect
further
bad
news
on
this
the

treaded

on
monday
pointing
to
a
flat
opening
on

after
solid

the
chinese
data
showed
its
economy
grew
percent
in
the
second
quarter
of
cooling
from
the
percent
growth
registered
in
each
of
the
previous
three
quarters
the
figures
came
in
line
with
market
forecasts
but
new
data
showing
growth
in
china
s
industrial
output
pointed
to
slowing
momentum
the
data
worries
investors
because
it
highlights
an
economy
slowing
just
as
trade
war
headwinds
are
gathering
the
question
is
what
happens
when
tariffs
spill
over
into
real
data
i
heard
my
economist
saying
that
some
of
the
fed
regional
reports
already
point
to
some
worries
there
said
ing
strategist
benjamin
schroeder
so
this
makes
the
powell
speech
important
this
week
if
he
makes
any
comments
on
how
the
trade
tariffs
may
affect
the
economy
