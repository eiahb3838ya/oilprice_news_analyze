monday
recommended
imposing
a
percent
duty

a
threat
to
domestic
solar
equipment
manufacturing
falling
prices
of
solar
cells
and
modules
over
percent
of
which
india
imports
from
china
have
triggered
a
decline
in
the
cost
of
solar
power
generation
and
led
indians
increasingly
to
adopt
the
technology
india
plans

energy
adoption
program
solar
module
manufacturers
are
facing
tough
and
unhealthy
competition
from

the
north
india
module
manufacturer
association
as
saying
the
china
chamber
of
commerce
for
imports
and
exports
of
machinery
and
electronic
products
said
the
real
cause
of
injury
to
the
domestic
industry
is
aggressive
pricing
practices
of
other
indian
producers
and
not
trade
relations
between
the
two
asian
nations
have
thawed
recently
despite

to
increase
indian
sales
of
farm

and
india
pushing

india
s
share
in
china
s
exports
of

rose
from
about
a
fifth
in
the
first
half
of

a
year
later
the

china
had
started
targeting
the
indian
market
more
some
indian
solar

a

indian
rupees
billion
under
jeopardy
