democratic
republic
of
congo
s
plan
to
drill
for
oil
in
national
parks
could
leave
thousands
of
farmers
and
fishermen
who
rely
on
the
land
in
a
struggle
to
survive
rights
groups
said
on
monday
the
central
african
country
announced
last
month
that
it
was
taking
steps
toward
declassifying
parts
of
virunga
and
salonga
national
parks
both
recognised
as
world
heritage
sites
by
the
united
nations
to
allow
for
oil
exploration
the
parks
which
together
cover
an
area
about
the
size
of
switzerland
are
among
the
world
s
largest
tropical
rainforest
reserves
and
home
to
rare
species
including
forest
elephants
allowing
drilling
in
the
parks
would
cause
a
loss
of
biodiversity
release
huge
amounts
of
carbon
dioxide
into
the
atmosphere
and
pollute
water
that
thousands
of
local
people
use
for
fishing
and
farming
according
to
several
rights
groups
congolese
state
spokesman
lambert
mende
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
that
the
government
will
study
the
potential
impact
of
oil
drilling
on
local
communities
before
they
proceed
the
government
has
previously
defended
its
right
to
authorise
drilling
anywhere
in
the
country
and
said
it
is
mindful
of
environmental
considerations
such
as
protecting
animals
and
plants
in
the
two
national
parks
there
are
communities
especially
in
virunga
that
are
very
dependent
on
fishing
and
on
the
park
s
integrity
said
pete
jones
of
environmental
advocacy
group
global
witness
that
really
needs
to
be
taken
into
account
and
doesn
t
seem
to
be
part
of
the
debate
that
s
happening
which
is
a
shame
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
conservation
group
world
wildlife
fund
wwf
also
said
it
is
concerned
about
the
impact
of
oil
drilling
on
at
least
people
who
benefit
from
the
fishing
industry
in
virunga
and
tens
of
thousands
more
who
farm
on
the
outskirts
of
the
parks
the
risks
of
pollution
are
clear
and
present
the
fishing
industry
would
suffer
considerably
if
it
gets
to
that
point
said
juan
seve
wwf
country
director
in
congo
the
oil
industry
would
be
unlikely
to
create
local
jobs
since
specialists
would
be
brought
in
from
abroad
he
added
the
s
cultural
agency
unesco
has
previously
said
that
oil
exploration
should
not
be
conducted
at
world
heritage
sites
