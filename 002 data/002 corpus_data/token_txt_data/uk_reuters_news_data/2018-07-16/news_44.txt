outages
in

and
strike
action
in

pushed

higher

for
a

straight

crude

fears
of

eased
news
that
libya
s
state
oil
producer
had
restarted
output
from
a
major
oil
field
ignited
the
selloff
earlier
in

anz
bank
said
in
a
note
the
market
focus
shifted
towards
possible
supply
increases
even
as
a
norwegian
union
for
workers
on
offshore
oil
and

drilling
rigs
stepped
up
a
strike
russia
and
other
major

may
increase

further
should

shortages
hit
the
global

market
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
on
friday
stephen
innes
head
of
trading
for
at
futures
brokerage
oanda
said
trade
tensions
should
subside
this
week
and
could
be
a
possible
plus
for
oil
prices
but
a
possible
sale
of
oil
reserves
would
weigh
on
prices
with
the
trump
administration
actively
considering
tapping
into
the
nation
s
strategic
petroleum
reserve
it
could
weigh
negatively
innes
said
the
united
states
holds
a
reserve
of
about
million
barrels
and
the
trump
administration
was
considering
drawing
on
the
country
s
oil
reserve
which
would
increase
supply
according
to
a
bloomberg
report
meanwhile
the
number
of
rigs
drilling
in
the
united
states
remained
unchanged
at
in
the
week
to
july
as
the
rate
of
the
growth
slowed
amid
a
fall
in
