explainer-how unstable is libya's oil production?
tunis
reuters
after
a
relatively
stable
spell
libya
s
oil
production
has
again
because
of
a
standoff
at
eastern
export
terminals
and
the
abduction
of
two
workers
at
the
giant
sharara
oilfield
military
clashes
followed
by
a
political
power
struggle
forced
the
national
oil
corporation
noc
to
halt
exports
at
ras
lanuf
es
sider
zueitina
and
hariga
terminals
in
late
june
and
early
july
threatening
to
keep
offline
as
much
as
barrels
per
day
bpd
the
ports
were
reopened
on
july
and
eastern
fields
gradually
resumed
operations
a
lengthy
shutdown
at
el
feel
oilfield
in
the
southwest
also
ended
but
two
days
later
output
at
the
nearby
bpd
sharara
was
slashed
after
two
staff
were
kidnapped
national
production
had
been
hovering
around
million
bpd
for
more
than
a
year
and
reached
million
bpd
in
february
with
most
recent
shutdowns
resolved
in
days
or
weeks
but
the
risk
of
further
output
shocks
will
linger
while
libya
remains
politically
and
militarily
divided
libya
has
the
largest
proven
reserves
of
oil
in
africa
and
has
been
a
key
light
sweet
crude
supplier
around
it
produced
more
than
million
bpd
and
before
the
uprising
in
which
muammar
gaddafi
was
toppled
and
killed
seven
years
ago
it
was
pumping
more
than
million
last
year
the
noc
outlined
plans
to
raise
production
to
million
bpd
by
but
said
this
would
need
around
billion
of
investment
foreign
oil
companies
including
italy
s
eni
total
of
france
austria
s
omv
and
firms
conocophillips
and
hess
have
production
stakes
through
joint
ventures
with
the
noc
since
libya
s
uprising
rival
groups
have
used
oil
facilities
as
bargaining
chips
to
press
financial
and
political
demands
power
is
split
between
shifting
armed
factions
in
the
east
and
west
aligned
with
competing
administrations
they
and
other
groups
have
cut
off
production
at
fields
and
ports
including
a
blockade
of
terminals
in
libya
s
eastern
oil
crescent
from
prolonged
shutdowns
have
reduced
pressure
at
wells
as
libya
s
revenue
fell
due
to
production
disruptions
and
lower
oil
prices
demands
for
salaries
local
development
and
jobs
that
feed
into
blockades
became
more
widespread
groups
including
islamist
militants
have
attacked
and
fought
over
oilfields
and
ports
most
the
storage
tanks
at
two
major
terminals
es
sider
and
ras
lanuf
have
been
damaged
or
destroyed
fields
including
mabruk
and
ghani
remain
closed
a
lack
of
funding
has
been
an
additional
drag
on
aging
infrastructure
and
regular
power
outages
are
a
further
constraint
international
companies
have
a
limited
presence
onshore
keeping
exploration
and
development
programs
mostly
on
hold
reasons
for
shutdowns
include
economic
protests
by
local
groups
pushing
for
cash
or
the
release
of
jailed
fighters
which
have
affected
ports
major
fields
and
parts
of
the
pipeline
network
the
petroleum
facilities
guards
pfg
whose
job
is
to
protect
oil
installations
often
hold
local
agendas
and
loyalties
guards
shut
down
the
el
feel
field
this
year
for
more
than
four
months
security
is
volatile
militants
including
some
linked
to
islamic
state
are
present
in
desert
areas
and
have
carried
out
attacks
near
facilities
or
fields
in
the
sirte
basin
risk
is
also
linked
to
libya
s
domestic
conflict
in
a
former
pfg
commander
who
had
led
earlier
port
blockades
gathered
opponents
of
military
chief
khalifa
haftar
along
with
mercenaries
to
attack
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
held
by
haftar
s
forces
since
after
the
assault
was
repelled
haftar
and
his
allies
said
they
would
take
control
of
most
of
libya
s
oil
through
a
parallel
noc
in
the
eastern
city
of
benghazi
complaining
that
too
many
of
the
revenues
flowing
through
the
central
bank
in
tripoli
had
been
passing
to
their
rivals
the
standoff
was
resolved
with
a
promise
to
look
into
central
bank
spending
and
a
sanctions
threat
against
those
trying
to
bypass
the
internationally
recognized
noc
but
the
internationally
recognized
government
of
national
accord
gna
in
tripoli
which
announced
the
investigation
into
spending
lacks
authority
meanwhile
efforts
to
unify
eastern
and
western
factions
showing
little
visible
progress
and
plans
for
elections
this
year
are
uncertain
along
with
nigeria
libya
has
been
exempted
from
production
cuts
designed
to
bolster
prices
both
have
signaled
their
intention
to
raise
output
