nothing is worse for climate than burning coal -ex u.s. epa chief
london
reuters
science
shows
that
nothing
does
more
to
cause
climate
change
than
burning
coal
a
former
head
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
said
on
tuesday
a
position
in
contrast
to
president
donald
trump
s
fuel
policies
trump
announced
last
year
that
the
united
states
would
quit
a
global
climate
pact
citing
concerns
for
the
economy
and
touting
energy
anew
but
alarming
nearly
signatories
to
the
accord
including
close
allies
on
monday
a
report
said
that
even
limiting
global
warming
to
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
below
the
degree
target
agreed
in
paris
would
entail
rapid
and
unprecedented
changes
across
every
aspect
of
society
or
the
world
risks
even
more
extreme
weather
and
loss
of
species
without
real
change
the
world
is
not
even
on
course
to
reach
the
target
according
to
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
report
the
main
scientific
guide
for
governments
on
how
to
implement
the
paris
agreement
we
have
big
challenges
ahead
of
us
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
report
has
told
us
a
future
is
better
from
a
climate
perspective
nothing
is
worse
than
burning
coal
former
epa
administrator
gina
mccarthy
told
a
financial
times
climate
finance
summit
in
london
i
would
like
to
see
climate
change
presented
as
what
science
is
telling
us
rather
than
a
political
statement
which
is
what
many
in
the
are
positioning
it
as
she
added
referring
to
the
trump
administration
under
the
paris
agreement
rules
the
united
states
can
not
actually
pull
out
of
the
pact
until
late
the
is
pretty
much
on
target
to
reach
its
climate
targets
at
least
in
the
the
market
is
driving
this
said
mccarthy
who
ran
the
epa
under
trump
s
predecessor
barack
obama
from
markets
drive
change
more
quickly
than
regulation
governments
are
not
going
to
be
the
ones
which
make
it
run
as
fast
as
it
needs
but
trump
aims
to
roll
back
many
environmental
rules
put
in
place
by
obama
such
as
acting
to
replace
a
clean
power
plant
policy
with
weaker
environmental
rules
for
such
plants
the
government
also
intends
to
freeze
mandates
that
ensure
new
cars
pollute
less
and
cut
limits
on
the
greenhouse
gas
methane
that
is
released
during
oil
production
mccarthy
said
such
moves
however
do
not
necessarily
translate
into
action
the
announcements
and
proposals
made
by
the
new
administration
have
not
been
finalised
they
are
not
based
on
science
and
the
law
and
that
is
not
exactly
a
winning
formula
when
you
go
to
the
courts
she
said
there
is
a
long
process
behind
all
of
this
and
eventually
they
will
end
up
in
the
courts
for
a
long
period
of
time
those
rules
were
solidly
done
and
based
on
science
and
the
law
and
it
will
take
a
lot
to
do
undo
the
ipcc
report
will
be
a
talking
point
at
the
katowice
climate
change
conference
in
poland
in
december
