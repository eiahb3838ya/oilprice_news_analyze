reach
a
compromise
over
what
carbon

limits
to
impose
on
europe
s
powerful
carmakers
we
saw
a
really
complicated
discussion
europe
s
climate
commissioner
miguel
arias
canete
said
of
the
compromise
that
gained
the
support
of
nations
with
voting
against
and
abstaining
i
never
believed
in
the
beginning
that
such
a
strong
support
would
be
the
final
rules
will
now
be
hashed
out
in
talks
beginning
on
wednesday
with
the
eu
s
two
other
lawmaking
bodies
the
european
parliament
which
is
seeking
a
more
ambitious
climate
target
and
the
european
commission
which
proposed
a
lower
one
in
a
joint
statement
earlier
the
eu
ministers
expressed
deep
concern
over
a
report
calling
for
rapid
and
unprecedented
action
to
contain
global
warming
and
renewed
commitment
to
the
paris
climate
accord
several
countries
had
sought
a
higher
percent
reduction
in
car
emissions
in
line
with
targets
backed
by
eu
lawmakers
last
week
but
softened
their
position
in
talks
however
ireland
and
the
netherlands
were
among
those
who
voiced
disappointment
with
the
compromise
deal
which
also
set
a
percent
target
for
cutting
emissions
from
vans
by
germany
with
its
big
auto
sector
had
backed
an
eu
executive
proposal
for
a
percent
cut
for
fleets
of
new
cars
and
vans
by
compared
with
levels
climate
campaigners
say
germany
has
still
not
learned
to
be
tougher
on
the
auto
industry
despite
the
scandal
that
engulfed
volkswagen
in
when
it
admitted
to
using
illegal
software
to
mask
emissions
on
up
to
million
diesel
vehicles
worldwide
germany
had
the
backing
of
several
eastern
european
nations
early
in
the
talks
against
more
ambitious
targets
eu
sources
said
but
a
amendment
helped
ease
concerns
over
the
new
rules
which
also
create
a
crediting
system
encouraging
carmakers
to
raise
sales
of
electric
cars
it
would
allow
for
a
different
accounting
in
countries
where
the
current
market
penetration
of
and
vehicles
is
less
than
percent
below
the
average
in
the
bloc
curbs
on
the
transport
sector
the
only
industry
in
which
emissions
are
still
rising
aim
to
help
the
bloc
meet
its
goal
of
reducing
greenhouse
gases
by
at
least
percent
below
levels
by
extreme
temperatures
across
the
northern
hemisphere
this
summer
have
fuelled
concerns
climate
change
is
gathering
pace
leading
some
countries
to
call
for
emissions
to
be
cut
at
a
faster
rate
than
planned
but
a
call
by
the
eu
s
climate
commissioner
and
eu
nations
for
the
bloc
to
increase
its
pledge
to
cut
emissions
by
percent
under
the
paris
accord
has
met
with
resistance
ahead
of
climate
talks
in
poland
in
december
the
bloc
s
environment
ministers
reiterated
their
commitment
to
leading
the
fight
to
limit
global
warming
they
said
the
eu
was
ready
to
communicate
or
update
its
nationally
determined
contribution
the
efforts
by
each
country
to
reduce
emissions
by
