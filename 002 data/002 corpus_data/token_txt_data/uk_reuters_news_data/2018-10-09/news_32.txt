european
stocks
were
sucked
back
into
the
red
on
tuesday
as
a
global
selloff
took
asia
to
a
low
and
left
wall
street
on
course
to
equal
its
longest
losing
streak
of
the
year
there
was
plenty
to
keep
the
stress
levels
high
ongoing
worries
about
italy
s
finances
pushed
its
borrowing
costs
to
their
highest
since
and
the
euro
lower
while
treasury
yields
were
hovering
at
a
high
there
was
still
strength
in
europe
s
oil
stocks
on
higher
crude
prices
but
most
sectors
had
buckled
to
leave
the
euro
stoxx
down
percent
at
a
low
and
s
p
dow
jones
and
nasdaq
futures
down
around
percent
if
the
s
p
ends
the
day
lower
it
will
be
its
fourth
red
day
in
a
row
for
the
seventh
time
this
year
it
hasn
t
seen
five
falls
yet
it
all
feels
like
it
s
quite
nervous
here
over
whether
things
are
going
to
break
out
of
ranges
or
not
said
saxo
bank
s
head
of
fx
strategy
john
hardy
he
also
pointed
to
the
rising
and
japanese
government
bond
yields
which
tend
to
set
the
bar
for
borrowing
costs
globally
as
well
as
the
latest
lows
for
china
s
yuan
china
s
central
bank
fixed
its
yuan
rate
at
per
dollar
on
tuesday
so
breaching
the
barrier
and
leading
speculators
to
push
the
dollar
up
to
in
the
spot
market
the
drop
should
be
a
positive
for
exporters
and
did
help
shanghai
blue
chips
edge
up
percent
yet
that
followed
a
percent
slide
on
monday
which
was
the
largest
daily
fall
since
early
asian
shares
overall
fell
to
a
low
pakistan
s
rupee
slumped
percent
in
an
apparent
devaluation
before
an
expected
international
monetary
fund
programme
the
indian
and
sri
lankan
rupees
both
hit
record
lows
that
also
followed
the
imf
s
first
downgrade
to
its
global
growth
forecast
since
growth
will
decline
once
parts
of
its
fiscal
stimulus
go
into
reverse
imf
chief
economist
maurice
obstfeld
predicted
italian
government
bond
yields
rose
to
a
high
of
percent
after
economy
minister
giovanni
tria
s
address
to
parliament
on
the
government
s
budget
plans
did
little
to
reassure
nervous
investors
tria
called
for
a
constructive
discussion
with
brussels
over
the
budget
and
said
he
did
not
think
italy
s
deficit
forecasts
were
so
shocking
eu
commission
jyrki
katainen
said
italy
s
situation
is
vulnerable
and
negotiations
may
prove
difficult
maybe
some
people
were
expecting
some
reassurance
from
tria
but
he
s
not
calling
the
shots
said
jan
von
gerich
chief
analyst
at
nordea
the
general
background
is
that
the
budget
continues
to
cause
back
in
asia
japan
s
nikkei
had
dropped
percent
hurt
in
part
by
a
rise
in
the
yen
and
as
yields
on
tokyo
s
government
bonds
prodded
the
percent
cap
the
bank
of
japan
effectively
has
on
them
a
senior
treasury
official
on
monday
had
also
expressed
concern
at
the
fall
in
the
chinese
yuan
adding
that
it
was
unclear
whether
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
would
meet
with
chinese
officials
this
week
on
wall
street
the
broad
spread
of
red
in
futures
markets
came
after
growth
and
tech
stocks
were
pressured
on
monday
by
worries
that
rising
bond
yields
which
raise
borrowing
costs
might
ultimately
hobble
the
economy
yields
on
treasury
paper
reached
a
top
on
tuesday
at
percent
but
were
edging
back
slightly
ahead
of
trading
treasuries
have
had
a
sort
of
safety
net
up
to
now
rising
yields
tend
to
dampen
stocks
and
threaten
the
economic
outlook
thus
putting
pressure
on
the
federal
reserve
to
go
slow
on
policy
tightening
but
the
fed
has
sounded
so
bullish
on
the
economy
and
so
hawkish
on
rates
that
the
net
has
become
frayed
the
size
and
speed
of
the
bearish
bond
impulse
would
suggest
a
collective
shift
in
market
thinking
about
the
growth
prospects
and
policy
projections
said
damien
mccolough
westpac
s
head
of
rates
strategy
the
fed
s
expected
profile
has
moved
from
just
below
hikes
to
hikes
being
factored
that
shift
has
underpinned
the
dollar
against
a
basket
of
currencies
where
it
stood
up
percent
at
from
a
low
of
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
against
the
yen
the
dollar
pulled
back
to
from
a
peak
last
week
the
euro
was
undermined
by
italy
s
political
troubles
