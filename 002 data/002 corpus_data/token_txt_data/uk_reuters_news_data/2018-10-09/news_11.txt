chevron
corp
wants
to
build
or
buy
a
refinery
along
the
gulf
coast
to
process
crude
oil
from
its
rapidly
growing
permian
basin
operations
a
senior
executive
said
on
tuesday
the
company
would
like
to
have
refining
operations
on
the
houston
ship
channel
in
the
western
part
of
the
gulf
to
complement
an
existing
eastern
gulf
refinery
in
mississippi
that
makes
lubricants
and
other
materials
pierre
breber
chevron
s
head
of
downstream
and
chemicals
said
something
on
the
ship
channel
side
could
make
a
lot
of
sense
for
our
company
breber
said
in
an
interview
on
the
sidelines
of
the
oil
money
conference
in

chevron
is
a
major
oil
producer
in
the
permian
basin

texas
and
new
mexico
the
largest
oilfield
the
company
s
permian
production
jumped
percent
sequentially
in
the
second
quarter
to
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
by
expanding
its
refining
capacity
to
houston
chevron
would
be
able
to
process
its
permian
crude
closer
to
where
it
is
produced
most
of
chevron
s
refineries
are
in
california
and
use
a
heavier
type
of
crude
than
the
light
sweet
kind
pumped
from
permian
shale
wells
the
ingredients
to
invest
in
the
gulf
are
very
sound
said
breber
who
assumed
his
current
role
in
and
previously
oversaw
chevron
s
pipeline
operations
rival
exxon
mobil
corp
said
last

invest

on
gulf
refining
projects

houston
ship
channel
links
the
busiest
petrochemical
port
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
is

facilities

the
company

refining
arm
and
is
widely
seen
by
wall
street
as
an
advocate
for
expanding
refining
operations
separately
berber
said
chevron
s
existing
mississippi
refinery
has
seen
shipments
from
venezuela
drop
percent
to
barrels
per
day
over
the
last
two
years
chevron
is
the
only
remaining
major
oil
