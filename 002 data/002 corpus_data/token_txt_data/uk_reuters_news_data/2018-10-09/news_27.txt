asian
shares
hit
lows
on
tuesday
as
china
allowed
its
currency
to
slip
past
a
psychological
bulwark
amid
recent
losses
in
domestic
share
markets
a
shift
that
pressured
other
emerging
currencies
the
pakistani
rupee
plunged
about
percent
in
an
apparent
devaluation
by
the
central
bank
market
participants
said
the
imf
added
to
the
malaise
by
cutting
forecasts
of
global
growth
for
both
this
year
and
next
including
downgrades
to
the
outlook
for
the
united
states
china
and
europe
risk
sentiment
is
in
a
foul
mood
and

are
sinking

jpmorgan
analysts
said
in
a
note
with
chinese
economic
momentum
continuing
to
weaken
alongside
increasing
pressure
from
the
united
states
currency
weakness
is
the
obvious
release
valve
they
warned
a
lurch
through
the
level
by
year
end
is
china
s
central
bank
fixed
its
yuan
at
per
dollar
on
tuesday
so
breaching
the
barrier
and
leading
speculators
to
push
the
dollar
up
to
in
the
spot
market
the
drop
should
be
a
positive
for
exporters

yet
that
follows
a

slide
on

was
the

since

japan
s
nikkei

hurt
in
part
by
a
rise
in
the
yen
on
monday
a
senior
treasury
official
expressed
concern
at
the
fall
in
the
yuan
adding
that
it
was
unclear
whether
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
would
meet
with
any
chinese
officials
this
week
on
wall
street
the
nasdaq
had
fallen
for
the
third
straight
day
on

and
growth

were
pressured
by
worries
rising

ultimately

at

treasuries
have
had
a
sort
of
safety
net
up
to
now
as
rising
yields
tend
to
dampen
stocks
and
threaten
the
economic
outlook
thus
putting
pressure
on
the
federal
reserve
to
go
slow
on
policy
tightening
yet
recently
the
fed
has
sounded
so
bullish
on
the
economy
and
so
hawkish
on
rates
that
the
net
has
become
frayed
the
size
and
speed
of
the
bearish

impulse
would
suggest
a
collective
shift

the

moved

that

the

against
a
basket

where
it
stood
at

the
