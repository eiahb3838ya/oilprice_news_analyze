any

that
qatar
was
trying

help
prevent
a
gaza
steinitz
accused
abbas
who
has
restricted
funding
for
gaza
of
seeking
to
make
gains
on
two
counts
by
encouraging
a
conflict
in
which
israel
will
clobber
hamas
and
over
which
he
will
then
be
able
to
clobber
israel
on
the
world
stage
israel
and
hamas
have
fought
three
wars
since
months
of
reconciliation
talks
between
hamas
and
abbas
have
been
held
up
by
disputes
abbas
believes
that
if
he
keeps
the
gaza
closure
tight
it
will
make
hamas
accept
his
reconciliation
plan
which
would
give
the
abbas
government
full
control
or
the
people
in
gaza
will
launch
a
revolution
against
hamas
said
palestinian
political
analyst
