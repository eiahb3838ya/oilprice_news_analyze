asian
shares
hit
lows
on
tuesday
as
china
allowed
its
currency
to
slip
past
a
psychological
bulwark
amid
sharp
losses
in
domestic
share
markets
a
shift
that
pressured
other
emerging
currencies
to
depreciate
to
stay
competitive
the

added
to
the
malaise
by
cutting
forecasts
of
global
growth
for
both

year
and
next
including
downgrades
to
the

for
the

and

mood

said
analysts
at

with

continuing

weaken
alongside
increasing

from
the

china
s
central
bank
on
tuesday
fixed
its
yuan
at
per

so
breaching
the
barrier
and
leading
speculators
to
push
the

up
to

the

the

be
a
positive

japan

hurt
in
part
by
a
rise
in
the
yen
on
monday
a
senior
treasury
official
expressed
concern
at
the
fall
in
the
yuan
adding
that
it
was
unclear
whether
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
would
meet
with
any
chinese
officials
this

on

the

had
fallen
for
the
third

were
pressured
by

treasuries
have
had
a
sort
of
safety
net
up
to
now
as
rising
yields
tend
to
dampen
stocks
and
threaten
the
economic
outlook
thus
putting
pressure
on
the
federal
reserve
to
go
slow
on
policy
tightening
yet
recently
the
fed
has
sounded
so
bullish
on
the
economy
and
so
hawkish
on
rates
that
the
net
has
become
frayed
the
size
and
speed
of
the
bearish

impulse
would
suggest
a
collective
shift

the

that

the

against
a
basket

where
it
stood
at
from
a
low
