said
turning

china
bought
nearly
million
tonnes
of
lpg
in
making
the
united

the
country
s
supplier
of
the
fuel
used
in
petrochemicals
as
well
as
for
cooking
transport
and
heating
however
imports
have
come
off
dramatically
over
the
course
of
before
stalling
completely
in
late
august
when
china
imposed
an
additional
percent
tariff
on
over
goods
including
lpg

retaliation

china
lpg
imports
from
top
suppliers
the
fall
came
as
chinese
buyers
wound
back
purchases
of
lpg
amid
uncertainty
about
the
impact
of
buying
product
from
the
united
states
said
a
trader
who
tracks
the
fuel
no
lpg
cargoes
have
landed
in
china
since
tariffs
were
imposed
in

fge
china
has
stopped
shipping
in
lpg
cargoes
as
they
are
now
too
expensive
added
a
second
trader
who
tracks
lpg
cargoes
the
united
states
last
year
accounted
for
about
percent
of
china
s
total
lpg
imports
which
are
currently
running
at
about
billion
a
month
based
on
thomson
reuters
calculation
the
gap
is
being
filled
largely
by
qatar
the
united
arab
emirates
uae
saudi
arabia
and
kuwait
analysts
said
the
change
comes
as
prices
for
the
fuel
often
a
mix
of
propane
and
butane
spike
in
line
with
higher
oil
prices
saudi
aramco
whose
contract
prices
are
used
as
benchmarks
in
asia
fixed
its
propane
and
butane
contract
prices
for
october
at
a
tonne
the
highest
since
prices
are
also
rising
the
propane
price
at
the
texan
mont
belvieu
hub
hit
its
highest
since
on
at
around
cents
per
gallon
before
easing
to
around
cents

lpg
prices
on
the
rise
in
line
with
crude
oil
this
works
out
to
about
a
tonne
based
on
reuters
calculations
but
is
above
the
saudi
aramco
price
after
taking
into
account
freight
and
terminal
charges
and
the
additional
percent
tariff
china
s
lpg
imports
rose
about
percent
to
nearly
million
tonnes
in
driven
partly
by
new
petrochemicals
plants
which
use
the
propane
dehydrogenation
method
to
produce
the
raw
material
for
ihs
s
he
said
lpg
prices
were
likely
to
stay
firm
in
november
and
december
due
to
higher
oil
prices
and
winter
demand
