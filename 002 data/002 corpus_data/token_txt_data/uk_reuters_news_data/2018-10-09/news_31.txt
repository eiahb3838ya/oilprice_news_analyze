what

said
was
a
and
drive
to
ease
conditions
in
the
enclave
and
stem
any
escalation
in
violence
the
shipment
was
a
potential
slap
to
the
administration
of
palestinian
president
mahmoud
abbas
which
opposed
the
foreign
relief
plan
gaza
is
controlled
by
abbas
s
rival
the
islamist
hamas
group
and
the
palestinian
president
has
been
using
economic
pressure
in
order
to
wrest
back
control
under
a
blockade
by
israel
and
egypt
designed
to
isolate
hamas
gaza
has
plunged
into
poverty
over
the
last
half
year
it
has
seen
weekly
often
violent
palestinian
border
protests
and
lethal
by
the
israeli
military
the
truck
that
entered
gaza
brought
the
first
delivery
out
of
a
million
fuel
donation
by
qatar
meant
to
provide
the
power
plant
with
enough
fuel
to
operate
for
six
months
local
sources
said
the
plant
has
been
providing
gazans
with
only
around
four
hours
of
electricity
daily
a
spokesman
for
the
palestinian
prime
minister
rami
hamdallah
who
is
based
in
the
west
bank
voiced
disapproval
of
the
fuel
delivery
any
international
financial
aid
to
the
gaza
strip
should
be
through
or
with
the
coordination
of
the
palestinian
government
he
said
in
order
to
preserve
palestinian
unity
and
to
stop
any
plans
to
separate
gaza
from
the
west
bank
a
qatari
official
speaking
to
reuters
on
sunday
said
doha
planned
to
help
with
gaza
s
power
crisis
at
the
request
of
donor
states
in
the
united
nations
to
prevent
an
escalation
of
the
existing
humanitarian
disaster
officials
could
not
immediately
be
reached
for
comment
israel
s
energy
minister
yuval
steinitz
told
reuters
on
monday
that
qatar
was
trying
to
help
prevent
a
gaza
steinitz
accused
abbas
who
has
restricted
pa
funding
for
gaza
of
seeking
to
make
gains
on
two
counts
by
encouraging
a
conflict
in
which
israel
will
clobber
hamas
and
over
which
he
will
then
be
able
to
clobber
israel
on
the
world
stage
israel
and
hamas
have
fought
three
wars
since
months
of
reconciliation
talks
between
hamas
and
abbas
have
been
held
up
by
disputes
abbas
believes
that
if
he
keeps
the
gaza
closure
tight
it
will
make
hamas
accept
his
reconciliation
plan
which
would
give
the
abbas
government
full
control
or
the
people
in
gaza
will
launch
a
revolution
against
hamas
said
palestinian
political
analyst
hani
this
is
making
it
easy
for
others
to
bypass
the
palestinian
authority
they
are
trying
to
give

protests
on

demand
an
easing
of
the
gaza
blockade

palestinian
families
fled
or
were
driven
from

at
least
palestinians
