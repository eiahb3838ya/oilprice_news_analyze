power
has
to
end
by
to
save
the
planet
that
seemingly
simple
but
bold
sentiment
is
likely
to
set
much
of
the
political
social
and
economic
agenda
for
the
coming
decades
but
in
the
end
it
will
come
down
to
what
china
does
the
united
nations
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
said
in
a
report
on
monday
that
unprecedented
changes
will
have
to
take
place
to
limit
the
rise
in
the
earth
s
temperature
to
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
warning
of
devastating
weather
events
and
species
loss
if
the
target
is
exceeded
in
order
to
achieve
the
goal
the
ipcc
said
coal
burning
would
have
to
drop
to
between
zero
and
percent
by
while
even
natural
gas
coupled
with
carbon
capture
and
storage
ccs
would
have
to
decline
to
percent
of
electricity
generation
by
the
middle
of
this
century
while
coal
has
long
been
the
bogeyman
of
climate
activists
the
ipcc
has
effectively
thrown
down
the
gauntlet
and
given
world
leaders
a
little
over
years
to
phase
it
out
entirely
initial
reaction
to
the
ipcc
report
has
been
predictable
with
supporters
of
renewable
energy
cheering
it
and
backers
of
fossil
fuels
resorting
to
the
familiar
arguments
that
somehow
the
science
is
either
wrong
or
a
hoax

australia
s
environment
minister
melissa
price
told
abc
radio
on
tuesday
that
the
ipcc
was
drawing
a
long
bow
by
calling
for
an
end
to
coal
by
and
touted
new
technologies
as
a
way
of
saving
the
polluting
fuel
australia
is
the
world
s
largest
exporter
of
coal
and
relies
on
the
fuel
for
more
than
percent
of
its
electricity
generation
price
isn
t
alone
in
touting
ccs
and
other
technologies
with
the
world
coal
association
responding
to
the
ipcc
report
by
saying
in
a
statement
on
its
website
that
ccs
is
vital
and
that
the
coal
lobby
group
will
push
for
it
to
be
adopted
however
elsewhere
on
the
group
s
website
it
acknowledges
that
currently
progress
of
ccs
is
too
slow
to
allow
necessary
emissions
reductions
goals
to
be
achieved
its
solution
is
to
spend
more
on
research
and
development
but
it
s
here
that
the
coal
lobby
will
run
into
problems
already
renewable
technologies
which
have
benefited
from
subsidies
are
becoming
cheaper
than
conventional
power
generation
a
trend
likely
to
continue
generation
with
ccs
would
likely
require
huge
subsidies
in
order
to
be
and
selling
such
largesse
with
public
money
will
be
incredibly
hard
for
governments
in
democracies
it
s
therefore
likely
that
the
scenario
currently
being
played
out
in
europe
will
be
extended
to
other
parts
of
the
world
with
power
being
replaced
by
a
combination
of
renewables
battery
storage
and
even
nuclear
coal
will
further
be
hamstrung
by
the
flight
of
capital
from
the
sector
with
commercial
and
development
banks
insurers
and
trading
companies
starting
to
retreat
from
financing
and
insuring
mines
and
power
plants
while
it
s
likely
that
the
developed
world
will
witness
ongoing
bitter
debates
over
policy
toward
fossil
fuels
the
actual
key
to
the
ipcc
target
is
china
and
to
a
lesser
extent
the
rest
of
developing
asia
china
is
the
world
s
largest
producer
consumer
and
importer
of
coal
and
any
genuine
attempt
to
remove
coal
from
the
world
s
energy
mix
by
will
require
massive
commitment
from
beijing
while
the
chinese
government
has
a
policy
of
limiting
the
use
of
coal
and
of
boosting
the
use
of
renewables
and
natural
gas
it
s
well
within
the
realms
of
wishful
thinking
to
imagine
the
world
s
economy
is
on
track
to
abandon
the
use
of
coal
by
according
to
the
global
coal
plant
tracker
china
currently
has
gigawatts
gw
of
power
operating
more
than
four
times
india
s
gw
the
positive
news
for
both
china
and
india
the
world
s
coal
importer
is
that
the
pipeline
of
plant
construction
has
been
consistently
shrinking
and
retirements
of
older
units
has
been
accelerating
but
given
that
once
built
plants
generally
operate
for
at
least
years
it
would
be
imperative
that
virtually
all
construction
is
halted
now
and
no
new
plants
commissioned
in
reality
china
currently
has
gw
of
power
in
construction
and
gw
either
announced
in
phase
or
with
permits
already
in
place
india
has
gw
being
built
and
gw
in
the
approval
process
there
are
also
new
coal
plants
being
built
or
planned
in
numerous
other
asian
countries
including
indonesia
pakistan
and
the
philippines
what
the
ipcc
report
may
do
is
accelerate
pressure
on
those
countries
to
their
power
generation
plans
especially
if
renewables
can
be
shown
to
be
as
cheap
and
as
reliable
it
s
also
likely
that
any
technological
advances
in
energy
in
the
next
decades
will
not
be
in
favour
of
coal
given
that
vast
sums
are
being
invested
in
renewables
and
comparatively
little
in
ccs
or
other
technologies
the
ipcc
report
highlights
that
coal
now
has
its
back
very
much
against
the
wall
but
equally
that
the
real
power
for
change
lies
in
beijing
natural
gas
also
tends
to
get
off
lightly
in
much
of
the
media
reporting
about
climate
change
especially
given
the
obvious
target
of
coal
but
like
silent
flatulence
in
an
elevator
eventually
natural
gas
will
be
unable
to
avoid
the
attention
that
is
making
life
so
difficult
for
the
coal
industry
