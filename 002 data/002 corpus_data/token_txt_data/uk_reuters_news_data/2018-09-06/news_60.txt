global
equities
remained
under
pressure
with
stocks
in
asia
down
for
the
sixth
straight
day
on
thursday
amid
fragile
investor
confidence
in
the
wake
of
turmoil
in
emerging
markets
and
anxiety
about
a
major
escalation
in
the
trade
conflict

hit
its

investors
were
focussed
on
the
trade
war
with
a
public
consultation
period
in
the
united
states
ending
thursday
on
additional
billion
of
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
an
escalation
of
the
trade
war
may
be
imminent
the
timing
is
somewhat
unclear
and
this
justifies
caution
even
given
the
dollar
pullback
jpmorgan
analysts
said
conviction
and
participation
will
likely
remain
light
until
an
measured
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
index
retreated
from

hit
earlier
this
week
to
be
last

investors
are
also
watching
for
developments
as
the
united
states
and
canada
resume
talks
about
revamping
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
nafta
canada
insisted
there
was
room
to
salvage
the
pact
despite
few
signs
a
deal
was
imminent
the
dollar
considered
a
safe
haven
at
times
of
turmoil
because
of
its
status
as
the
world
s
reserve
currency
has
generally
benefited
from
these
trade
uncertainties
it
has
gained
percent
since
with
currencies
in
emerging
markets
taking
a
hammering
the
financial
crises
in
argentina
and
turkey
have
sent
shivers
in
many
other
emerging
markets
and
in
indonesia
the
central
bank
has
had
to
intervene
several
times
in
recent
weeks
to
stem
the
slide
in
its
rupiah
currency
the
emerging
market
equity
index
has
been
crunched
in
the
past
month
or
so
the
index
has
fallen
for
five
consecutive
sessions
and
is
so
far
down
more
than
percent
this
week
an
index
of
emerging
market
currencies
held
near
lows
after
two
straight
days
of
heavy
declines
analysts
at
capital
economics
believe
there
was
room
for
further
declines
in
emerging
market
equities
a
range
of
factors
have
hit
em
stocks
recently
namely
policy
tightening
by
the
federal
reserve
crises
in
turkey
and
argentina
trade
war
and
broader
concerns
about
china
s
economy
we
doubt
that
the
main
factors
which
have
caused
equities
across
much
of
the
emerging
world
to
weaken
together
recently
will
go
away
just
yet

argentina
s
peso
gained
some
respite
on
wednesday
as
government
officials
in
washington
sought
emergency
funding
to
stem
an
economic
crisis
the
nation
is
asking
the
international
monetary
fund
for
early
disbursements
from

outcome

a
shade
firmer

as
sentiment
was
boosted
by
economic
growth
data
on
wednesday
the
currency
is
however
down
about
percent
so
far
this

as
it
is
used
