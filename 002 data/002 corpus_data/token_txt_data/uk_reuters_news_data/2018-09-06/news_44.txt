frankfurt
germany
s
financial
centre
must
ban
older
diesel
vehicles
from
the
city
centre
from
next
february
as
part
of
a
plan
to
improve
air
quality
the
country
s
administrative
court
ruled
on
wednesday
the
decision
by
the
court
in
wiesbaden
on
a
case
brought
by
environmental
group
deutsche
umwelthilfe
duh
came
after
a
landmark
ruling
by
germany
top
administrative
court
in
february
opened
the
door
to
bans
the
ban
would
affect
about
a
quarter
of
cars
registered
in
frankfurt
and
numerous
commuters
who
live
around
the
city
duh
leader
juergen
resch
said
the
decision
would
help
accelerate
the
shift
to
electric
cars
and
called
on
chancellor
angela
merkel
to
force
carmakers
to
pay
to
retrofit
diesel
vehicles
with
systems
to
avoid
a
ban
the
regional
government
of
hessen
also
called
for
a
speedy
reaction
from
berlin
on
retrofits
which
the
car
industry
has
lobbied
against
because
it
could
cost
billions
of
euros
we
want
a
fundamental
solution
to
this
problem
rather
than
driving
bans
state
premier
volker
bouffier
and
environment
minister
priska
hinz
said
in
a
joint
statement
merkel
has
said
she
will
do
everything
possible
to
avoid
driving
bans
but
disagreements
over
how
to
tackle
the
problem
of
diesel
cars
with
high
nitrogen
oxide
nox
emissions
have
strained
her
coalition
with
the
social
democrats
the
ruling
comes
a
day
after
unveiled
its
electric
suv
marking
the
start
of
a
german
onslaught
against
tesla
s
dominance
of
the
market
for
premium
battery
cars
the
court
ruled
that
frankfurt
must
ban
from
next
february
diesel
cars
that
meet
and
older
emission
standards
and
petrol
cars
that
meet
and
standards
while
diesels
must
be
banned
from
next
september
the
driving
ban
is
necessary
because
all
other
measures
considered
by
the
state
will
not
lead
to
a
significant
reduction
of
nitrogen
dioxide
emissions
in
an
appropriate
time
said
presiding
judge
rolf
hartmann
the
court
also
ordered
other
measures
to
cut
pollution
in
frankfurt
such
as
more
electric
buses
higher
parking
fees
and
more
places
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
duh
has
argued
that
banning
diesels
is
the
only
way
for
frankfurt
to
meet
european
union
clean
air
rules
which
stipulate
that
nitrogen
dioxide
pollution
should
not
exceed
micrograms
per
cubic
meter
of
air
on
average
we
need
to
understand
that
this
is
about
a
threat
to
our
health
hartmann
said
in
his
opening
remarks
adding
that
this
was
not
merely
a
niche
matter
for
environmentalists
pollution
levels
have
regularly
exceeded
the
limit
since
the
court
heard
the
city
of
hamburg
this
year
voluntarily
blocked
diesel
models
that
fail
to
meet
the
latest
emissions
standards
from
using
selected
trunk
roads
other
cities
including
aachen
duesseldorf
and
stuttgart
home
to
daimler
and
porsche
are
also
considering
bans
the
threat
of
bans
on
diesel
vehicles
has
already
led
to
higher
sales
of
petrol
engine
cars
in
germany
which
are
less
fuel
efficient
and
cause
more
carbon
dioxide
pollution
this
in
turn
makes
it
harder
for
carmakers
to
cut
emissions
of
greenhouse
gases
increasing
pressure
on
them
to
push
electric
or
hybrid
vehicles
