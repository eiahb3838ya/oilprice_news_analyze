oil
prices
dipped
on
thursday
as
emerging
market
turbulence
weighed
on
sentiment
while
a
deadline
neared
for
a
potential
new
round
of
tariffs
on
another
billion
of
chinese
goods
sanctions
against
iran
however
prevented
prices
from
falling
further
as
they
are
expected
to
tighten
the
market
after
being
implemented
from

emerging
market
woes
are
weighing
on
global
economic
growth
prospects
with
asian
shares
on
thursday
heading
for
their
sixth
straight
session
of
losses
meanwhile
a
public
comment
period
on
possible
tariffs
on
another
billion
of
chinese
goods
ends
on
thursday
with
expectations
that
president
donald
trump
will
impose
the
additional
levies
the
prospects
of
increased
supplies
from
opec
and
her
allies
and
weaker
demand
from
china
and
other
emerging
markets
could
weigh
further
on
oil
prices
going
forward
or
at
least
limit
the
upside
potential
said
fawad
razaqzada
analyst
at
futures
brokerage
forex
this
is
because
of
the
dollar
s
strength
weighing
heavily
on
emerging
market
currencies
including
the
yuan
which
in
turn
has
pushed
up
the
costs
of
all
commodities
he
said
crude
stockpiles
fell
last
week
as
refineries
boosted
output
amid
strong
consumption
data
from
industry
group
the
american
petroleum
institute
showed
on
wednesday
crude
inventories
fell
by
million
barrels
to
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
while
refinery
crude
runs
rose
by
barrels
per
day

the
data
showed
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
said
on
wednesday
it
expected
global
oil
demand
to
break
through
million
bpd
for
the
first
time
this
year
meanwhile
there
are
concerns
that
sanctions
against
iran
which
will
target
the
s
oil
industry
from
november
will
tighten
global
supply
a
further
risk
is
seen
in
venezuela
where
a
government
and
political
crisis
has
halved
oil
production
in
the
last
two
years
to
little
more
than
million
bpd
david
maher
managing
director
for
energy
at
commodity
trading
house
rcma
group
said
venezuela
s
declines
will
continue
as
a
lack
of
cash
and
infrastructural
collapse
are
not
easy
to
fix
investment
bank
jefferies
said
the
brent
forward
curve
has
inverted
to
backwardation
signalling
a
tightening
market
that
already
feels
the
effects
of
declining
iranian
backwardation
describes
a
forward
curve
in
which
prices
for
immediate
delivery
are
higher
than
those
for
dispatch
later
on
this
signals
tight
market
conditions
as
it
gives
traders
an
incentive
to
immediately
sell
oil
instead
of
putting
it
into
storage
brent
crude
is
currently
more
than
per
barrel
more
expensive
than
for
september
rcma
s
maher
said
he
expected
brent
prices
to
average
per
