on

ending

president
donald
trump
said
on
wednesday
that
the
united
states
was
not
yet
ready
to
come
to
an
agreement
over
trade
disputes
with
china
but
he
said
talks
would
continue
an
escalation
of
the
trade
war
may
be
imminent
the
timing
is
somewhat
unclear

this
justifies
caution
even
given
the
dollar
pullback

measured
against

basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
index
retreated
from
highs
hit
earlier
this
week
to
stand
flat
at
conviction
and
participation
will
likely
remain
light
until
an
announcement
they
said
further
weighing
on
sentiment
data
out
earlier
showed
german
industrial
orders
fell
unexpectedly
in
july
in
another
sign
that
factories
in
europe
s
largest
economy
are
feeling
the
bite
of
protectionist
trade
politics
the
euro
was
a
tad
softer
at
investors
are
also
watching
for
developments
as
the
united
states
and
canada
resume
talks
about
revamping
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
canada
insisted
there
was
room
to
salvage
the
pact
despite
few
signs
a
deal
was
imminent
the
dollar
considered
a
safe
haven
at
times
of
turmoil
because
of
its
status
as
the
world
s
reserve
currency
has
generally
benefited
from
these
trade
uncertainties
it
has
gained
percent
since
with
currencies
in
emerging
markets
taking
a
hammering
the
financial
crises
in
argentina
and
turkey
have
sent
shivers
through
emerging
markets
while
in
indonesia
the
central
bank
has
had
to
intervene
several
times
in
recent
weeks
to
stem
the
rupiah
currency
s
slide
indonesia
s
benchmark
stock
index
was
last
up
percent
while
the
rupiah
also
gained
a
tad
an
index
of
emerging
market
currencies
paused
near
lows
after
two
straight
days
of
heavy
declines
but
analysts
warned
about
further
losses
as
investors
were
no
longer
looking
at
argentina
turkey
and
south
africa
as
isolated
cases
they
are
fretting
over
the
impact
of
rising
inflation
and
interest
rates
on
heavily
indebted
asian
economies
the
upshot
is
that
this
pause
should
not
be
mistaken
for
a
panacea
to
the
ongoing
emerging
market
crisis
which
demands
utmost
policy
vigilance
and
perhaps
coordination
analysts
at
mizuho
said
in
a
note
the
emerging
market
equity
index
has
been
crunched
in
the
past
month
or
so
falling
for
six
consecutive
sessions
and
down
more
than
percent
this
week
analysts
at
capital
economics
believe
there
is
room
for
further
declines
a
range
of
factors
have
hit
em
stocks
recently
namely
policy
tightening
by
the
federal
reserve
crises
in
turkey
and
argentina
the
trade
war
and
broader
concerns
about
china
s
economy
we
doubt
that
the
main
factors
which
have
caused
equities
across
much
of
the
emerging
world
to
weaken
together
recently
will
go
away
just
yet
