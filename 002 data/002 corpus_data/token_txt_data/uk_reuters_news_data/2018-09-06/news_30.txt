archaeologists

scouring
the
seabed
where
a
gas
pipeline
is
being
built
off
israel
s
coast
in
a
bid
to
preserve
relics
near
a
port
which
once
was
a
key
trade
hub
for
the
mediterranean
s
ancient
civilisations
the
pipeline
from
the
leviathan
gas
field
that
is
due
to
begin

comes
ashore
near
dor
beach
in
northern
israel
a
popular
spot
among
israeli
sunbathers
it
is
also
the
site
of
the
ancient
port
of
dor
where
hidden
in
the
seabed
lie
the
vestiges
of
marine
traders
throughout
the
ages
from
the
phoenicians
to
the
romans
to
minimise
damage
to
such
relics
the
israel
antiquities

has
been
working
over
the
past

a
team
spent
weeks
scuba
diving
in
the
warm
crystal
clear
water
off
the
beach
dispersing
silt
to
uncover
ancient
artefacts
a
robot
was
used
for
searches
in
deeper
water
they
found
earthenware
jugs
anchors
and
the
remains
of
wrecked
ships
setting
new
guidelines
for
similar
future
projects
there
has
been
unprecedented
cooperation
to
protect
the

yaakov

archaeology
unit
of
the
israel
antiquities
authority
told

sharvit
said
noble
financed
most
of
the
archaeological
surveys
and
a
large
research
ship
to
help
extract
ancient
objects
along
the
pipeline
s
route
the
pipeline
is
being
buried
meters
below
the
seabed
to
minimise
any
impact
on
the
surroundings
leviathan
was
discovered
in
about
km
miles
off
israel
s
coast
its
development
will
be
the
largest
energy
project
in
israel
s
history
what
is
unique
here
in
israel
is
the
ancient
place
that
we
re
operating
said
binyamin
zomer
vice
president
for
regional
affairs
for
noble
energy
we
work
very
closely
with
the
antiquities
authority
here
in
israel
to
make
sure
that
should
we
discover
such
finds
we
first
of
all
avoid
causing
harm
to
those
areas
and
secondly
to
make
sure
that
they
are
aware
of
the
resources
and
potential
finds
that
they
his
company
says
the
project
will
not
harm
the
environment
and
will
replace
less
healthy
fossil
fuels
but
some
local
environmentalists
and
residents
oppose
the
plan
which
along
with
the
pipeline
includes
a
towering
production
platform
to
be
built
just
km
from
shore
local
resident
and
marine
archaeologist
kurt
raveh
who
has
been
excavating
at
dor
for
decades
and
founded
its
diving
club
thinks
the
survey
being
done
is
insufficient
he
worries
the
area
is
at
risk
from
potential
pipeline
leaks
we
have
so
many
treasures
and
old
shipwrecks
and
things
like
that
we
should
get
them
out
of
the
water
before
we
can
t
enter
the
water
anymore
