update 1-dirty secrets: tainted shipping fuel sparks calls for tighter quality control
singapore
reuters
a
wave
of
contaminated
fuel
that
has
clogged
and
damaged
engines
on
hundreds
of
oil
tankers
and
container
vessels
in
the
past
months
has
pushed
shippers
to
demand
stricter
quality
controls
around
the
world
the
calls
are
shining
a
light
on
the
notoriously
opaque
shipping
fuel
sector
where
any
contamination
can
spread
quickly
and
be
difficult
to
trace
back
to
its
source
that
is
because
large
volumes
of
fuel
oil
are
blended
with
cutter
stocks
by
suppliers
and
sold
on
through
an
extensive
network
of
middlemen
before
finding
their
way
into
ships
fuel
tanks
this
tide
of
dirty
fuel
comes
when
the
shipping
industry
the
backbone
of
global
commerce
with
over
percent
of
the
world
s
traded
goods
transported
on
the
oceans
is
bracing
for
an
unprecedented
shift
to
fuel
from
we
strongly
believe
that
the
marine
fuel
industry
should
get
a
grip
on
the
situation
and
take
on
the
responsibility
it
has
in
these
matters
said
mads
zacho
chief
executive
officer
at
danish
shipping
company
lauritzen
when
approached
for
comment
on
the
tainted
fuel
the
international
bunker
industry
association
ibia
referred
reuters
to
a
statement
issued
in
in
which
it
said
it
was
not
useful
to
seek
to
apportion
fault
when
there
is
no
agreement
as
to
what
the
root
cause
is
the
contamination
first
emerged
at
the
gulf
coast
as
early
as
january
this
year
but
the
exact
suppliers
and
sources
of
the
contaminants
remain
unknown
it
then
spread
to
places
such
as
singapore
the
world
s
largest
hub
for
marine
fuel
also
known
as
bunker
fuel
and
onto
other
ports
in
asia
the
maritime
and
port
authority
of
singapore
mpa
said
in
a
statement
emailed
on
thursday
that
contaminants
had
been
detected
in
a
small
handful
of
fuel
samples
from
singapore
between
april
and
july
all
the
affected
bunker
suppliers
in
singapore
had
exercised
due
diligence
in
adhering
to
both
international
and
local
bunker
fuel
quality
control
requirements
the
mpa
said
adding
that
it
had
stepped
up
sampling
checks
and
testing
the
port
of
houston
authority
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
the
tainted
fuel
can
harm
engines
in
ways
such
as
clogging
pipelines
or
overwhelming
fuel
filters
marine
fuel
surveyor
and
consulting
firm
maritec
pte
ltd
has
said
some
damage
can
be
repaired
at
sea
but
other
cases
have
required
vessels
to
return
to
port
a
source
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
that
at
least
two
oil
tankers
operated
by
oil
giant
bp
had
been
hit
by
cases
of
contaminated
fuel
that
cost
big
money
and
big
delays
he
declined
to
be
identified
as
he
was
not
authorised
to
speak
with
media
while
bp
did
not
respond
to
reuters
request
for
comment
you
have
bunker
ports
where
the
contaminated
fuel
exists
then
it
gets
sliced
and
diced
over
different
suppliers
and
different
bunker
barges
then
eventually
it
hits
the
ship
operator
said
douglas
raitt
regional
consultancy
manager
at
ship
classifier
lloyd
s
register
he
added
that
while
it
was
difficult
to
give
an
exact
number
around
to
ships
could
have
been
affected
globally
which
would
dwarf
previous
such
problems
this
lack
of
investigation
into
such
a
serious
breach
of
safety
norms
is
totally
inadequate
and
hugely
disappointing
intertanko
an
association
of
independent
tanker
owners
and
operators
with
a
combined
fleet
of
almost
ships
said
in
a
statement
in
august
it
did
not
specify
which
authorities
it
thought
should
investigate
the
issue

while
regulations
governing
marine
fuel
standards
have
been
established
by
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
the
united
nations
shipping
agency
in
practice
few
countries
appear
to
be
properly
discharging
these
obligations
said
john
bradshaw
technical
director
at
the
international
chamber
of
shipping
which
represents
over
percent
of
the
world
s
merchant
fleet
most
countries
take
a
position
that
it
is
a
commercial
matter
between
fuel
suppliers
and
purchasers
and
that
they
have
no
obligation
in
ensuring
the
quality
of
fuel
oil
supplied
to
ships
in
areas
under
their
jurisdiction
said
bradshaw
fuel
standards
in
other
mass
transport
sectors
including
aviation
tend
to
be
strictly
enforced
as
problems
there
could
lead
to
fatal
accidents
the
marine
fuel
industry
has
had
its
fair
share
of
scandals
including
and
illegal
of
fuel
through
what
the
industry
calls
the
cappuccino
effect
where
sticky
fuel
oil
is
frothed
to
inflate
its
apparent
volume
to
buyers
the
ibia
said
that
a
common
but
speculative
view
was
that
the
current
wave
of
contagion
likely
came
from
inappropriate
cutter
stocks
used
in
the
production
of
bunkers
at
one
or
more
refineries
terminals
the
industry
uses
cutter
stocks
to
help
meet
marine
fuel
grade
specifications
in
similar
cases
in
the
past
the
source
of
the
contaminant
was
never
adequately
identified
but
the
root
cause
was
by
and
large
a
lack
of
control
of
the
quality
of
cutter
stock
used
in
the
marine
pool
the
ibia
said
meanwhile
the
imo
will
from
force
shippers
to
use
fuels
with
percent
sulphur
content
by
mass
down
from
percent
currently
problems
with
contaminated
fuels
might
become
an
even
bigger
problem
in
because
you
have
to
think
about
the
fact
that
percent
mass
sulphur
fuel
requires
a
lot
more
blending
than
percent
mass
sulphur
fuel
said
raitt
at
lloyd
s
register
intertanko
said
that
if
the
fuel
delivered
to
ships
continued
to
lack
quality
controls
that
could
also
undermine
a
safe
and
smooth
enforcement
of
the
rules
if
those
responsible
for
providing
good
lasting
quality
fuels
show
the
same
lack
of
interest
as
shown
so
far
in
addressing
and
solving
the
root
causes
of
current
contamination
problems
the
landscape
only
looks
more
troublesome
for
ship
owners
