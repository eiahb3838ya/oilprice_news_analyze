column-india boosts purchases of indonesian coal as prices drop: russell

one
of
the
standout
commodity
performers
this
year
has
been
thermal
coal
but
not
all
coal
is
created
equal
and
disparities
in
pricing
may
help
explain
why
india
s
imports
have
stayed
strong
despite
the
higher
costs
the
main
benchmark
for
thermal
coal
in
asia
is
priced
at
australia
s
newcastle
port
the
world
s
largest
harbour
the
price
has
gained
percent
so
far
this
year
to
close
at
a
tonne
in
the
week
to
according
to
assessments
by
argus
media
this
isn
t
far
off
the
year
high
of
nearly
a
tonne
hit
in
july
with
the
price
surge
this
year
largely
coming
on
the
back
of
increased
chinese
demand
for
coal
to
be
burned
in
power
stations
what
has
been
somewhat
surprising
is
that
india
the
world
s
coal
importer
behind
china
has
defied
its
prior
history
of
being
a
buyer
and
boosted
its
imports
this
year
but
delving
into
the
detail
offers
an
explanation
as
to
why
this
is
the
case
the
price
of
the
bulk
of
the
coal
india
imports
has
been
declining
especially
in
recent
months
india
imported
million
tonnes
of
coal
in
the
first
eight
months
of
the
year
up
percent
on
the
same
period
last
year
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
of
this
million
tonnes
came
from
indonesia
making
the
southeast
asian
nation
india
s
top
supplier
india
tends
to
import
lower
quality
coal
from
indonesia
with
a
typical
grade
being
fuel
with
an
energy
rating
of
kilocalories
per
kilogram
the
price
for
this
type
of
coal
as
assessed
by
argus
media
has
been
declining
since
late
june
dropping
to
a
tonne
in
the
week
ended
it
has
fallen
percent
since
june
and
is
now
down
percent
so
far
this
year
the
gap
between
newcastle
coal
with
an
energy
content
of
and
indonesian
is
now
at
its
widest
since
early
this
appears
to
have
shored
up
indian
buying
of
indonesian
coal
with
imports
rising
in
august
to
million
tonnes
up
from
million
in
july
according
to
the
data
given
the
recent
difficulties
coal
india
has
experienced
in
meeting
domestic
requirements
it
s
little
surprise
that
indian
buyers
have
ramped
up
purchases
from
indonesia
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
india
hasn
t
increased
the
amount
of
coal
it
buys
from
other
top
suppliers
australia
is
india
s
supplier
but
it
ships
almost
exclusively
coking
coal
used
in
steelmaking
and
is
thus
not
a
competitor
with
indonesia
however
south
africa
exports
thermal
coal
which
is
similar
in
quality
and
pricing
to
australia
s
newcastle
benchmark
india
imported
million
tonnes
from
south
africa
in
august
down
from
million
in
july
perhaps
indicating
less
of
an
appetite
for
the
more
expensive
but
higher
quality
fuel
one
question
that
remains
to
be
answered
is
why
is
the
price
of
indonesian
coal
falling
while
higher
grades
are
still
either
rising
or
staying
close
to
highs
while
it
s
too
early
to
provide
a
definitive
answer
it
appears
that
china
may
be
buying
less
indonesian
coal
with
imports
dropping
to
million
tonnes
in
august
from
million
tonnes
in
both
july
and
june
according
to
data
china
has
also
struggled
with
domestic
coal
availability
mainly
as
a
result
of
output
restrictions
as
part
of
efforts
to
combat
air
pollution
this
has
boosted
demand
for
imports
but
it
seems
chinese
buyers
are
preferring
higher
energy
content
australian
coal
over
indonesian
grades
much
of
the
coal
china
buys
from
indonesia
is
used
as
a
blending
feedstock
with
domestic
supplies
in
a
compromise
that
sees
a
drop
in
overall
energy
content
but
also
a
drop
in
sulphur
and
ash
given
indonesian
coal
is
low
in
these
pollutants
