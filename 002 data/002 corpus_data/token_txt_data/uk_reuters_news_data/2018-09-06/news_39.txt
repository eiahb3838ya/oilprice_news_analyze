power
was
restored
to
a
nuclear
energy
plant
in
hokkaido
northern
japan
on
thursday
after
a
strong
earthquake
left
it
relying
on
emergency
generators
for
nervous
hours
but
it
may
be
a
week
before
lights
are
back
on
all
over
the
major
island
triggering
a
blackout
just
after
local
time
the
magnitude
quake
left
at
least
seven
people
dead
more
than
injured
and
dozens
missing
on
hokkaido
an
island
of
about
million
people
whose
capital
is
sapporo
a
major
power
station
was
also
damaged
in
the
temblor
that
shut
down
the
grid
the
situation
at
utility
hokkaido
electric
power
s
tomari
nuclear
plant
provided
an
uncomfortable
if
comparatively
brief
echo
of
the
fukushima
daiichi
nuclear
disaster
in
reactors
there
melted
down
after
a
massive
tsunami
knocked
out
generators
designed
to
maintain
power
to
cool
reactors
in
emergencies
though
tomari
was
shut
down
after
the
fukushima
disaster
in
it
needs
electricity
to
keep
fuel
rods
cool
and
had
to
rely
on
diesel
generators
that
kicked
in
after
the
quake
until
power
was
restored
to
all
three
reactors
by
local
time
hokkaido
electric
is
now
scrambling
to
get
power
restored
to
households
factories
and
other
customers
even
as
rescuers
bring
in
heavy
machinery
and
digging
equipment
to
search
for
survivors
that
may
be
trapped
in
stricken
buildings
in
another
echo
of
the
disaster
hokkaido
s
situation
was
compounded
by
difficulties
in
receiving
supplies
from
neighbouring
regions
that
remain
dominated
by
separate
utilities
with
their
own
grids
a
hokkaido
electric
spokesman
said
the
utility
was
not
receiving
any
supplies
from
the
island
of
honshu
to
the
south
home
to
tokyo
osaka
and
nagoya
despite
there
being
a
megawatt
connection
for
transferring
power
from
the
coast
of
japan
s
main
island
nationwide
they
have
been
trying
to
bolster
power
systems
by
linking
these
fairly
balkanized
domains
but
it
s
not
as
easy
as
it
sounds
said
andrew
dewit
professor
of
energy
policy
at
rikkyo
university
in
tokyo
it
requires
equipment
like
transformers
that
is
quite
expensive
and
damage
to
transmission
lines
transformers
and
other
equipment
from
the
quake
is
likely
also
delaying
the
restoration
of
power
dewit
said
by
early
afternoon
hokkaido
electric
had
restarted
one
megawatt
unit
at
its
sunagawa
station
its
coal
station
which
normally
supplies
about
half
the
island
s
electricity
remained
shut
after
sustaining
damage
in
the
quake
the
abrupt
halt
in
supplies
from
caused
such
a
huge
imbalance
in
supply
and
demand
that
other
power
plants
on
hokkaido
had
to
be
shut
own
industry
minister
hiroshige
seko
told
reporters
in
tokyo
it
may
take
a
week
to
restore
power
fully
to
hokkaido
he
said
thursday
s
blackout
prompted
the
shutdown
of
hokkaido
s
new
chitose
airport
a
popular
gateway
to
the
most
northern
of
japan
s
main
islands
the
second
major
airport
to
be
knocked
out
in
the
country
in
two
days
after
a
typhoon
swamped
the
nation
s
a
number
of
industrial
plants
and
factories
were
also
affected
a
fire
that
broke
out
at
a
steel
production
facility
at
mitsubishi
steel
manufacturing
s
joint
venture
with
nippon
steel
sumitomo
metal
corp
in
muroran
hokkaido
was
extinguished
with
little
damage
to
the
facilities
a
company
official
said
the
plant
will
work
towards
resuming
special
steel
production
after
power
supply
from
hokkaido
electric
is
restored
the
official
said
it
usually
takes
about
eight
hours
to
resume
production
after
the
power
supply
has
been
secured
he
said
meanwhile
idemitsu
kosan
japan
s
refiner
by
sales
stopped
all
refining
and
product

said
it
closed
its
chitose
plant
which
accounts
for

percent
of
its

output
because
of
the
power
outage
there
was
no
structural
damage
to
the
factory
