world
shares
fell
for
a
fifth
straight
day
on
thursday
as
investors
braced
for
another
escalation
in
a
trade
war
between
the
united
states
and
china
while
currencies
paused
near
lows
the

the
main
worry
for
investors
was
the
end
of
a
public
consultation
period
on
thursday
for
president
donald
trump
s
plan
to
impose
tariffs
on
an
additional
billion
of
chinese
goods
trump
said
on
wednesday
trade
talks
with
china
would
continue
but
the
united
states
was
not
yet
ready
to
come
to
an
agreement
unlike
the
last
few
days
where
there
has
at
least
been
a
wave
of
pmi
purchasing
manager
indexes
to
deal
with
thursday
has
little
in
the
way
of
distraction
for
the
european
markets
meaning
investors
are
just
going
to
have
to
sit
and
stew
in
this
particularly
unpleasant
trading
broth

resume

there

a

the

considered
a
safe

msci

currencies
which
had
earlier
paused
near

was
up
percent
on
the
day
after
two
straight
days
of
heavy
declines
but
analysts
warned
about
further
losses
because
investors
were
no
longer
looking
at
argentina
turkey
and
south
africa
as
isolated
cases
they
were
fretting
over
the
impact
of
rising
inflation
and
interest
rates
on
heavily
indebted
economies
as
global
monetary
conditions
slowly
tighten
the

to
