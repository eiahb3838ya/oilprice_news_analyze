asian
shares
fell
for
a
sixth

session
on
thursday
as
oil

and
gold

investor
confidence
shaken
by
turmoil
in
emerging
markets
and
jitters
over
a
potentially
severe
escalation

investors
were
focused
on
the

with
a

consultation
period
on
the
trump
administration
s
intent
to
impose
tariffs
on
an
additional
billion
of
chinese
goods
ending
on
thursday
an
escalation
of
the
trade
war
may
be
imminent
the
timing
is
somewhat
unclear
and
this
justifies
caution
even
given
the
dollar
pullback
jpmorgan
analysts
said
conviction
and
participation
will
likely
remain
light
until
an
trump
said
on
wednesday
that
the
united
states
was
not
yet
ready
to
come
to
an
agreement
over
trade
disputes
with
china
but
he
said
talks
would
continue
measured
against
a
basket

currencies
the

index
retreated

this
week
to
be
last
down
percent
at
overnight

the

investors
are
also
watching
for
developments
as
the
united
states
and
canada
resume
talks
about
revamping
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
canada
insisted
there
was
room
to
salvage
the
pact
despite
few
signs
a
deal
was
imminent
the
dollar
considered
a
safe
haven
at
times
of
turmoil
because
of
its
status
as
the
world
s
reserve
currency
has
generally
benefited
from
these
trade
uncertainties
it
has
gained
percent
since
with
currencies
in
emerging
markets
taking
a
hammering
the
financial
crises
in
argentina
and
turkey
have
sent
shivers
through
emerging
markets
while
in
indonesia
the
central
bank
has
had
to
intervene
several
times
in
recent
weeks
to
stem
the
rupiah
currency
s
slide
indonesia
s
benchmark
stock
index
was
last
up
percent
while
the
rupiah
also
rose
a
tad
an
index
of
emerging
market
currencies
paused
near
lows
after
two
straight
days
of
heavy
declines
but
analysts
warned
about
further
losses
as
investors
were
no
longer
looking
at
argentina
turkey
and
south
africa
as
isolated
cases
they
are
also
fretting
over
the
impact
of
rising
inflation
and
interest
rates
on
heavily
indebted
asian
economies
the
upshot
is
that
this
pause
should
not
be
mistaken
for
a
panacea
to
the
ongoing
emerging
market
crisis
which
demands
utmost
policy
vigilance
and
perhaps
coordination
analysts
at
mizuho
said
in
a
note
the
emerging
market
equity
index
has
been
crunched
in
the
past
month
or
so
falling
for
six
consecutive
sessions
and
down
more
than
percent
this
week
analysts
at
capital
economics
believe
there
was
room
for
further
declines
a
range
of
factors
have
hit
em
stocks
recently
namely
policy
tightening
by
the
federal
reserve
crises
in
turkey
and
argentina
the
trade
war
and
broader
concerns
about
china
s
economy
we
doubt
that
the
main
factors
which
have
caused
equities
across
much
of
the
emerging
world
to
weaken
together
recently
will
go
away
just
yet
capital

said
in
a
note
argentina
s
peso
had
some
respite
on
wednesday
as
government
officials
in
washington
sought
emergency
funding
to
stem
an
economic
crisis
the
nation
is
asking
the
international
monetary
fund
for
early
disbursements
from
a
billion
standby
loan
agreed
in
june
which
had
failed
to
clear
concerns
about
the
country
s
ability
to
pay
off
its
debt
