london
reuters
iran
criticized
saudi
arabia
s
plan
to
raise
oil
output
and
pressure
from
the
united
states
on
riyadh
do
so
saying
this
was
in
breach
of
opec
s
decision
last
week
and
belittled
the
producer
group
opec
and
a
group
of
countries
agreed
on
saturday
that
they
would
return
to
percent
compliance
with
previously
agreed
oil
output
cuts
after
months
of
underproduction
by
opec
countries
including
venezuela
and
angola
iran
s
opec
governor
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
was
reacting
to
various
news
reports
on
monday
and
tuesday
that
saudi
arabia
would
boost
output
in
july
to
million
barrels
a
day
million
bpd
and
million
bpd
up
from
its
opec
target
of
million
bpd
on
monday
energy
secretary
rick
perry
said
the
deal
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
may
not
be
enough
to
relieve
the
oil
market
the
state
department
says
it
is
short
and
saudi
arabia
says
they
will
produce
million
bpd
in
july
i
regret
to
say
they
both
are
ridiculing
our
organization
kazempour
told
reuters
the
comments
underline
the
depth
of
the
disagreement
between
iran
and
saudi
arabia
longtime
rivals
in
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
over
the
interpretation
of
opec
s
deal
in
vienna
last
week
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
the
opec
deal
implied
an
indirect
reallocation
of
extra
production
from
countries
unable
to
produce
more
oil
to
those
such
as
his
own
that
are
able
to
do
so
iran
strongly
disagrees
in
the
last
meeting
of
opec
our
resolution
does
not
allow
any
member
to
produce
more
than
their
quota
but
to
try
to
reach
percent
compliance
kazempour
said
there
is
no
mandate
to
breach
our
accord
if
they
do
it
means
the
state
department
is
running
before
the
meeting
iran
had
demanded
opec
reject
calls
from
president
donald
trump
for
an
increase
in
oil
supply
arguing
that
he
had
contributed
to
a
recent
rise
in
prices
by
imposing
sanctions
on
iran
and
venezuela
the
call
on
saudi
arabia
to
raise
output
comes
as
the
united
states
has
urged
countries
to
cut
all
imports
of
iranian
oil
from
november
iran
in
response
said
removing
iranian
oil
from
the
market
by
then
is
impossible
