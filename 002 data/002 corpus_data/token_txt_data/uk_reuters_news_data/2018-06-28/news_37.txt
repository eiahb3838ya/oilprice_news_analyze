prepare
ourselves

face
any
eventuality

an
iranian
oil
official
told
the
tasnim
news
agency
on
wednesday
the
options
to
find
replacements
to
iranian
oil
have
widened
after

agreed
with

allies
last

to
raise
output
from
july
by
about
million
bpd
with
saudi

numbers

willing
to
give
you

the

said
to
boost
its
sales
to
india
iran
recently
offered
virtually
free
shipping
and
an
extended
credit
period
of
days
we
can
buy
basra
heavy
saudi
or
kuwait
oil
to
replace
iran
finding
replacement
barrels
is
not
a
problem
but
it
has
to
give
the
best
economic
value
