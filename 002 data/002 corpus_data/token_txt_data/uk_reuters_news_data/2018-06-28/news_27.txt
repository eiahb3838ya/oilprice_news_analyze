india
ltd
is
the
country
s
biggest
gas
marketing

and
owns
most

have
said
that
gail

keep
its

marketing
businesses
independent
of
each
other
my
job
is
to

can
also
utilise
that
infrastructure

did
not
give
a
reason
for
the
government
s
change
of
position
on
splitting
up
the
company
which
was
seen
earlier
as
a
move
to
raise
money
by
selling
its
marketing
arm
