until
recently
edgar
barrera
enjoyed
a
life
many
mexicans
could
only
hope
for
in
a
few
short
years
the
bookkeeper
rose
from
handyman
to
worker
at
what
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
most
stable
companies
in
latin
america
oil
firm

thanks
to
pemex
barrera
met
his
wife
vacationed
on
the
mayan
riviera
and
envisaged
a
rewarding
career
without
leaving
his
hometown
in
tabasco
a
rural
state
at
the
southern
hook
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
where
more
than
half
the
population
lives
on
less
than
roughly
a
month
then
everything
changed
oil
prices
plummeted
forcing
pemex
to
cut
his
and
thousands
of
other
jobs
across
mexico
an
energy
reform
meant
to
spur
business
with
private
competitors
struggled
to
attract
immediate
investment
and
the
gang
violence
that
has
crippled
mexico
over
the
last
decade
finally
spread
to
tabasco
previously
a
relatively
peaceful
corner
of
the
country
mounting
consequences
from
an
economic
recession
to
soaring
murder
rates
have
rapidly
made
tabasco
one
of
mexico
s
most
troubled
states
its
small
but
once
seemingly
solid
now
struggles
with
a
downturn
and
lurid
violence

himself
after
brushes
with
extortionists
and
kidnappers
who
may
have
once
been
pemex
colleagues
recently
sought
asylum
in
canada
paraiso
or
paradise
is
the
tabasco
town
where
barrera
grew
up
and
worked
at
a
pemex
port
it
is
now
a
hell
he
said
it
s
little
surprise
that
industry
turbulence
would
hurt
tabasco
home
to
mexico
s
first
petroleum
discovery
and
a
state
where
more
than
half
the
economy
and
nearly
half
the
jobs
rely
on
the
oil
sector
but
the
extent
of
the
problems
has
caught
locals
industry
executives
and
government
officials
off
guard
especially
as
criminals
increasingly
exploit
what
s
left
of
any
prosperity
by
targeting
pemex
resources
equipment
and
employees
the
oil
debacle
hit
us
hard
said
tabasco
governor
arturo
nunez
it
caused
social
problems
that
without
question
are
contributing
to

enrique
pena
nieto
now
in
his
last
year
in
office
made
an
overhaul
of
the
energy
industry
his
signature
initiative
ending
pemex
s
longstanding
grip
on
exploration
production
refining
and
retail
fuel
sales
proponents
long
argued
that
operators
besides
pemex
are
needed
to
reverse
more
than
a
decade
of
declining
crude
output
and
unlock
potential
in
untapped
deposits
but
the
reform
finalised
in
came
into
law
just
as
global
oil
prices
collapsed
dampening
companies
willingness
to
invest
despite
a
recent
rebound
the
price
of
crude
in
global
markets
plummeted
by
as
much
as
percent
as
of
june
of
that
year
since
then
pemex
has
slashed
nearly
jobs
across
mexico
about
percent
of
its
workforce
according
to
company
figures
in
tabasco
pemex
let
go
workers
or
roughly
percent
of
the
jobs
the
state
shed
between
and
according
to
government
data
many
of
the
other
layoffs
were
among
suppliers
and
other
businesses
that
rely
on
pemex
combined
the
cutbacks
gave
tabasco
mexico
s
highest
unemployment
rate
and
mired
the
state
in
recession
in
the
most
recent
year
for
which
data
is
available
tabasco
s
economy
shrank
by
percent
it
is
the
only
state
where
both
poverty
and
extreme
poverty
defined
by
the
government
as
monthly
income
of
less
than
about

risen
in
recent
years
compounding
troubles
nationwide
the
woes
have
eroded

ahead
of
a
july

election
for
pena
nieto
s
successor
as
the

to
build
a

in
his
home
state
although
pemex
has
recently
begun
to
hire
back
a
few
workers
other
companies
have
been
reluctant
to
invest
in

who
recently
scrapped
plans

they
fell

morphed
and
moved
into
new
rackets
including

and
extortion

in
industries
from
agriculture
to
mining
and

earlier
this
year
reuters
reported
how
fuel
thieves
are
crippling
mexico
s
refineries
and
unleashing
bloodshed
in
formerly
calm
centres
of
pemex
operations
in
tabasco
police
registered
murders
last
year
over
triple
the
number
in
despite
a
population
of
million
people
small
compared
with
many
of
mexico
s
other
states
and
giant
capital
district
tabasco
had
the
kidnapping
tally
and
number
of
extortions
reported
last
year
current
and
former
pemex
workers
are
at
both
ends
of
the
crimes
some
as
victims
but
others
as
instigators
participants
or
informants
emboldened
by
the
impunity
and
graft
that
have
enabled
crime
nationwide
some
locals
have
turned
to
illicit
businesses
joining
or
seeking
to
start
gangs
that
steal
pemex
fuel
machinery
and
supplies
others
are
targeting
relatively
current
and
former
pemex
workers
such
as
barrera
in
a
statement
pemex
said
it
has
zero
tolerance
with
any
worker
involved
in
any
the
company
said
it
cooperates
with
local
state
and
federal
police
to
investigate
illegal
activity
but
declined
to
comment
on
specific
episodes
or
cases
involving
individual
workers
mentioned
in
this
story
during
a
recent
interview
carlos
trevino
pemex
s
chief
executive
conceded
that
employees
are
increasingly
at
risk
because
of
their
jobs
and
pay
petroleros
have
a
better
salary
than
many
other
people
he
said
using
the
spanish
term
for
oil
industry
workers
across
mexico
trevino
added
the
company
is
increasing
measures
to
ensure
the
security
of
personnel
and
property
it
has
taken
its
name
and
logo
off
trucks
it
told
workers
to
stop
wearing
pemex
uniforms
off
site
still
he
said
it
s
hard
to
have
a
completely
safe
this
thing
in
tabasco
he
added
it
s
not
mexico
s
first
known
oil
discovery
took

was
rushing
to
see
his

when
his

got
stuck
in
black
sludge
according
to
a
local
history
of
the
find
despite
warnings
by
natives
that
a
witch
there
turned
people
into
salt
the
priest
returned
and
began
tapping
the
oil
with
partners
he
later
sold
his
venture
to
a
british

now
seeking

joined
pemex
in
that
year
the
country

reached
a
record
high
and
opportunities
seemed
boundless
mexico
was
one
of
many
producers
poised
to
benefit
from
steadily
climbing

as
the
global

the
assumption
that
most
of
the

was
known
and
diminishing
first
hired
as
a
maintenance
worker
barrera
worked
his
way
up
through
other
positions
got
training
and
eventually
began
reviewing
company
accounts
for
a
salary
of
about
a
month
he
married
a
fellow
pemex
auditor
bought
two
cars
and
enjoyed
regular
seafood
outings
with
his
wife
their
daughter
and
two
stepsons
until
oil
prices
plunged
barrera
weathered
initial
pemex
layoffs
but
in
november
was
let
go
he
immediately
sought
other
jobs
but
with
many
others
already
scrambling
for
work
he
found
only
occasional
freelance
assignments
soon
paraiso
was
reeling
two
brothers
mario
and
pedro
maciel
emerged
as
local
crime
bosses
according
to
state
prosecutors
rumours
swirled
they
had
set
up
a
branch
of
the
jalisco
new
generation
cartel
known
for
drug
trafficking
fuel
theft
and
countless
other
crimes
across
mexico
some
gulf
of
mexico
oil
workers
many
of
whom
come
from
inland
states
were
already
getting
extorted
by
the
cartel
on
trips
into
jalisco
new
generation
territory
alayn
herver
a
native
of
the
central
state
from
which
the
cartel
took
its
name
until
last
year
worked
on
offshore
oil
rigs
that
dot
the
tabasco
shoreline
because
of
the
intense
schedules
required
there
herver
would
spend
two
weeks
on
the
rigs
and
then
two
weeks
on
leave
back
home
in
jalisco
in
october
while
in
a
bar
in
his
hometown
of
ciudad
guzman
a
stranger
approached
him
and
demanded
roughly
about
half
his
monthly
salary
we
know
you
earn
well
the
man
said
do
you
want
something
to
happen
to
you
at
first
herver
thought
the
man
was
joking
outside
though
some
of
the
man
s
colleagues
awaited
in
an
suv
ready
to
take
him
to
an
atm
herver
realized
they
were
members
of
the
jalisco
cartel
he
paid
the
men
who
told
him
a
similar
payoff
would
be
expected
each
month
for
half
a
year
herver
complied
the
transaction
became
so
routine
that
the
gang
members
appeared
to
lose
interest
herver
didn
t
report
the
extortion
like
many
mexicans
he
was
wary
of
widespread
corruption
in
police
ranks
and
feared
they
would
only
make
matters
worse
the
following
april
he
decided
to
skip
a
payment
on
his
next
trip
home
in
may
local
police
pulled
him
over
herver
said
they
handcuffed
him
and
put
him
in
their
patrol
car
you
ve
got
yourself
into
trouble
he
recalled
one
officer
telling
him
alejandro
romero
a
senior
officer
with
the
ciudad
guzman
police
force
declined
to
comment
on
the
incident
the
jalisco
state
attorney
general
s
office
didn
t
respond
to
requests
for
comment
as
another
policeman
followed
in
herver
s
car
a
mini
cooper
the
officers
drove
to
a
spot
near
the
city
dump
he
said
there
six
armed
men
including
the
gang
member
who
first
approached
him
pummeled
herver
pull
his
pants
down
one
of
the
gangsters
said
they
beat
his
bare
buttocks
with
a
paddle
and
repeatedly
threatened
to
rape
him
one
of
the
assailants
put
a
gun
to
his
head
while
another
grabbed
his
cell
phone
and
began
posting
live
video
to
herver
s
own
facebook
feed
horrified
friends
and
family
watched
the
raw
footage
shifting
from
herver
s
drained
expression
to
of
his
bloody
behind
i
thought
they
were
going
to
kill
me
herver
said
instead
they
let
him
go
keeping
the
mini
as
payment
in
paraiso
the
maciel
brothers
denied
connections
to
the
cartel
or
any
such
crimes
they
published
an
open
letter
on
facebook
stating
they
were
citizens
we
are
a
family
they
wrote
in
the
letter
dedicated
to
its
work
for
pemex
at
dos
bocas
the
port
a
worker
named
pedro
maciel
did
in
fact
work
for
pemex
in
tabasco
as
recently
as
according
to
a
database
of
company
workers
reviewed
by
reuters
mario
s
name
didn
t
appear
in
the
registry
for
locals
the
brothers
reassurances
made
little
difference
it
was
already
apparent
that
a
pemex
job
wasn
t
what
it
once
was
others
besides
the
maciel
brothers
were
suspected
across
paraiso
of
using
their
positions
as
perches
from
which
to
steal
fuel
extort
workers
and
commit
other
crimes
those
familiar
with
the
industry
say
it
makes
sense
that
criminals
not
just
victims
could
emerge
from
the
pemex
payroll
even
if
not
committing
atrocities
themselves
some
employees
are
believed
to
cooperate
with
gangs
for
their
own
cut
of
the
proceeds
or
merely
out
of
fear
they
know
the
guts
of
the
place
so
they
can
provide
information
said
raul
munoz
a
former
pemex
chief
executive
who
now
has
private
business
with
the

in
tabasco
and
says
he
faces

problems
everyone

the

barrera
said
echoing
family
members
who
believe
the
kidnapping
was
planned
with
inside
information
the
workers
are
feasting
on
one
last
november
barrera
secured
a
few
weeks
work
as
a
pemex
contractor
the
threats
grew
closer
a
colleague
told
barrera
s
wife
who
still
works
at
pemex
that
suspicious
men
had
been
asking
about
her
outside
the
office
gates
colleagues
then
told
barrera
that
armed
men
were
waiting
outside
the
office
for
him
too
terrified
he
slept
in
the
office
that
night
enough
he
thought
barrera
booked
a
ticket
to
canada
where
mexicans
can
travel
with
no
visa
he
landed
in
toronto
last
christmas
and
applied
for
asylum
he
hopes
to
bring
his

moved
to

was
doing

after

the

his
sprawling
collective

welding

has
grown
aggressive
to

another

among
other

he
admits
to

to
keep
them
from

they
wield

sometimes

the
tactics
are
not
out
of
the
ordinary
in
a
country

industry
where
corrupt
labour
leaders
are
known
to
bribe
both
companies

daza
said
he

choice

to
use

at
a
time
when
the
oil

both
the
root
