update 1-nuclear, coal bailout worth any cost 'to keep america free' -us energy chief
washington
reuters
energy
secretary
rick
perry
said
on
thursday
that
bailing
out
struggling
coal
and
nuclear
power
plants
is
as
important
to
national
security
as
keeping
the
military
strong
and
that
the
cost
to
americans
should
not
be
an
issue
you
can
not
put
a
dollar
figure
on
the
cost
to
keep
america
free
he
told
reporters
at
a
press
conference
in
washington
when
asked
about
the
administration
s
effort
to
extend
the
lives
of
the
facilities
when
asked
about
the
cost
of
a
potential
bailout
he
said
he
did
not
yet
know
we
look
at
the
electricity
grid
as
every
bit
as
important
to
national
security
as
making
sure
we
have
the
right
number
of
ships
aircraft
and
personnel
he
said
what
is
your
freedom
worth
president
donald
trump
ordered
the
department
of
energy
doe
to
take
emergency
measures
to
slow
the
retirements
of
coal
and
nuclear
power
plants
arguing
those
kinds
of
facilities
can
store
months
of
fuel
on
site
and
therefore
withstand
supply
disruptions
that
could
be
caused
by
storms
hacks
or
physical
attacks
the
effort
fits
neatly
with
the
administration
s
broader
agenda
to
boost
fossil
fuels
production
and
to
save
the
coal
industry
but
has
been
criticized
by
an
unusual
alliance
of
drillers
renewable
energy
advocates
environmentalists
regulators
and
grid
operators
who
say
it
is
unnecessary
and
unfair
aging
coal
and
nuclear
facilities
have
been
shuttering
at
a
rapid
pace
in
recent
years
pushed
out
by
cheaper
natural
gas
as
well
as
renewable
energy
sources
like
wind
and
solar
a
driving
factor
in
declining
emissions
of
greenhouse
gases
the
trump
administration
considers
natural
gas
and
renewable
energy
vulnerable
however
because
plants
rely
on
pipelines
that
can
be
disrupted
and
solar
and
wind
facilities
only
produce
energy
under
certain
weather
conditions
perry
pointed
out
that
nearly
all
military
bases
rely
on
power
from
the
civilian
grid
the
doe
is
currently
studying
ways
to
bail
out
coal
and
nuclear
facilities
including
potentially
by
mandating
grid
operators
to
purchase
power
from
them
perry
said
the
doe
is
examining
the
costs
now
federal
energy
regulators
rejected
a
previous
effort
by
perry
to
require
them
to
subsidize
nuclear
and
coal
plants
for
providing
resilience
to
the
grid
that
did
not
stop
the
coal
industry
from
making
new
requests
for
help
from
the
administration
in
late
march
firstenergy
s
firstenergy
solutions
unit
which
runs
coal
and
nuclear

called
on
the
energy
secretary
to
use
the
emergency
powers
to
lift
the
