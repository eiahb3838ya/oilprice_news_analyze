oil

dipped
from

its

virtually

and
still
below
recent
may
highs
oil
prices
have
been
rallying
for
much
of
on
tightening
market
conditions
due
to
record
demand
and
voluntary
supply
cuts
led
by
the
middle
east
dominated
producer
cartel
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
unplanned
supply
disruptions
from
canada
to
libya
and
venezuela
have
added
to
those
cuts
yet
not
all
indicators
point
towards
an
market
although
output
growth
is
slowing
crude
production
is
approaching
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
with
russia
and
saudi
arabia
at
similar
levels
and
output
expected
to
rise
as
opec
and
russia
ease
their
supply
restrictions
there
will
soon
be
three
countries
pumping
out
million
barrels
of
crude
each
and
every
day
this
unprecedented
output
means
just
three
countries
are
meeting
a
third
of
world
consumption
the
physical
oil
market
is
well
supplied
said
konstantinos
venetis
senior
economist
at
research
firm
ts
lombard
although
he
warned
opec
and
russia
were
producing
at
near
maximum
output
leaving
a
thinner
margin
of
safety
for
the
despite
rising
output
commercial
crude
oil
inventories
dropped
by
almost
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
june
to
million
barrels
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
on
wednesday
that
s
below
the
average
level
of
around
million
barrels
traders
expect
inventories
to
draw
further
in
coming
weeks
as
an
outage
of
canada
s
syncrude
locks
in
over
bpd
of
production
the
outage
is
expected
to
last
at
least
through
july
according
to
operator
suncot
the
draw
in
inventories
was
also
due
to
high
exports
of
almost
million
bpd
coupled
with
domestic
refinery
activity
hitting
a
utilization
rate
of
percent
the
highest
in
more
than
a
decade
oil
demand
has
been
chasing
records
for
most
of
but
the
outlook
is
dimming
amid
escalating
trade
disputes
between
the
united
states
and
other
major
economies
including
china
and
the
european
union
our
macroeconomic
view
remains
overwhelmingly
bearish

credit
conditions
have
worsened
again
which
is
likely
to
have
an
outright
negative
impact
on
the
demand
for
crude
oil
in
the
next
weeks
