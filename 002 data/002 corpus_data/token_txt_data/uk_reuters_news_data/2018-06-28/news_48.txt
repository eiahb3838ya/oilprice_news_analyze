danish
wind
turbine
maker
vestas
and
offshore
services
firm
maersk
supply
service
are
teaming
up
to
tackle
the
cost
of
transporting
and
installing
ever
larger
wind
turbines
seeking
to
remain
profitable
as
european
countries
phase
out
subsidies
the
industry
is
turning
to
ever
bigger
turbines
to
harness
power
more
efficiently
and
respond
to
pricing
pressure
for
new
equipment
around
the
globe

service
part
of
said
on
thursday
the
initial
focus
of
the
partnership
would
be
on
developing
a
new
crane
to
manoeuvre
and
install
mainly
onshore
but
also
offshore
wind
turbines
some
of
which
stand
taller
than
skyscrapers
the
challenge
for
the
industry
is
that
installation
and
logistics
around
the
turbines
become
a
greater
share
of
the
costs
bo

vestas
head
of
innovation

the
crane
will
be
developed
with

mitsubishi
heavy

vestas
said
adding
that
it
has
received
million
danish

million
in
public

investment
in

wind
farms
and
equipment
is
forecast
to
rise

billion
this
year
according
to
windeurope
after
a
shift
to

led

mhi
vestas
launched
a

mw
offshore
turbine
currently
the
world
s
most
powerful
wind
turbine
but
bigger
ones
are
expected
in
the
future
as
their
efficiency
increases

the
world
s
wind
turbine
maker
is
working
to
develop
a
mw
turbine
that
will
stand
metres
feet
tall
for
maersk
supply
service
the
partnership
could
open
up
new
revenue
streams
outside
the
struggling
oil
service
industry
at
a
time
when
the
business
is
up
for
sale
as
part
of
maersk
s
transformation
from
conglomerate
to
a
focused
shipping
firm
a
prototype
of
the
crane
is
expected
in
the
fourth
quarter
next
year
with
production
starting
in
two
to
three
years
