china
the
biggest
importer
of
iran
s
oil
has
not
committed
to
the
position
the
sanctions
are
trying
to
isolate
iran
a
bit
more
and
that
potentially
cuts
more
oil
off
from
the
overall
global
arena
as

strategist
at

wealth
management
if
you
re
having
iran
s
oil
taken
off
the
market
then
you
have
a
decrease
in
supply
and
by
all
means
that
s
going
to
put
more
pressure
on
the
price
of
oil
to
move
the
demands
follow
a
decision
by
the
organization
of
the

last

to
increase

to
try
to
moderate

prices
that
have

the

you
look
at
the

spreads
for
crude
oil
and
it
s
been
the

blown

almost
like
this

as
well
but
analysts
say
the
market
has
little
spare
capacity
to
deal
with
further
disruptions
with
inventories
still
declining
and
spare

uncomfortably
low
there
is
very
little
cushion
for
any
