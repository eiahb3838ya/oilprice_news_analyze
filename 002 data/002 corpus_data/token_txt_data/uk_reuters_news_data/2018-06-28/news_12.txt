a
strong
stakeholder
engagement
program
at
a
liquefied
natural
gas
export
plant
on
canada
s
west
coast
has
helped
pare
the
risk
of
delays
and
cost
overruns
for
the
c
billion
billion
project
a
project
executive
told
reuters
lng
canada
currently
being
reviewed
by
its
joint
venture
partners
ahead
of
a
final
investment
decision
has
focused
hard
on
ensuring
government
indigenous
people
and
local
communities
are
on
board
with
the
project
susannah
pierce
lng
canada
s
director
of
external
relations
told
reuters
late
on
wednesday
at
the
triennial
world
gas
conference
in
washington
strong
environmental
and
first
nation
opposition
to
energy
projects
has
hurt
investor
confidence
in
canada
in
recent
years
malaysia
s
petronas
last
year
walked
away
from
its
pacific
northwest
lng
project
which
was
fiercely
opposed
by
local
indigenous
groups
i
think
what
industry
is
figuring
out
is
it
s
not
that
we
can
t
design
projects
from
a
technical
perspective
what
s
slowing
them
down
or
what
s
not
allowing
them
to
be
delivered
on
time
or
on
budget
is
the
stakeholder
issue
pierce
said
lng
canada
has
been
endorsed
by
its
local
first
nation
community
and
enjoys
strong
support
within
the
host
town
of
kitimat
british
columbia
the
province
has
also
backed
the
project
offering
tax
cuts
and
power
perks
the
associated
pipeline
meanwhile
announced
this
week
c
million
in
construction
contracts
awarded
to
first
nation
groups
along
the
route
all
of
these
things
are
lining
up
to
show
that
there
is
the
stakeholder
support
that
our
joint
venture
participants
should
feel
confident
in
in
making
a
decision
to
move
the
project
forward
pierce
said
lng
canada
is
a
joint
venture
between
giant

s
petronas
petrochina

added
that
the
partners
had
been
reviewing
the

package
for
the
last
six
months

remains
hopeful
that
