the
markets
have
taken
a
battering
as
worries
about
a
wobbly
yuan
and
the
trade
spat
with
the
united

have
left
investors
bracing
for
a
rocky
final
six

on

trump
said
on
wednesday
he
will
use
a
strengthened
national
security
review
process
to
thwart
chinese
acquisitions
of
sensitive
american
technologies
a
softer
approach
than
imposing
investment
restrictions
although
that
lifted
stocks
initially
optimism
quickly
evaporated
after
white
house
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
said
trump
s
announced
plan
did
not
indicate
a
softened
stance
on
china
markets
remain
anxious
about
trump
s
hard
line
approach
to
get
better
trade
deals
with
early
signs
his
stance
may
not
only
be
backfiring
but
also
hurting
the
global
economy
two
major
auto
trade
groups
on
wednesday
warned
the
administration
that
imposing
up
to
percent
tariffs
on
imported
vehicles
would
cost
hundreds
of
thousands
of
auto
jobs
dramatically
hike
prices
on
vehicles
and
threaten
industry
spending
on
cars
the
move
came
after
motorcycle
maker
inc
said
earlier
this
week
it
would
move
production
for
european
customers
overseas
to
avoid
retaliatory
tariffs
initially
investors
saw
trump
s
moves
as
negotiation
tactics
to
get
better
deals
but
now
they
are
starting
to
worry
about
the
damage
to
the
economy
said
mutsumi
kagawa
chief
global
strategist
at
rakuten
securities
people
have
long
thought
the
economy
will
eventually
hit
a
recession
at
some
point
but
there
are
growing
worries
trump
s
trade
policies
may
hasten
that
the
fear
now
is
that
america
first
may
become
america
worst
he
added
the
treasuries
yield
dropped
to
percent
edging
near
its
may
low
of
percent
in
worrying
sign
for
some
investors
the
yield
curve
flattened
further
with
the
spread
between
two
and
year
yields
shrinking
to
a
low
of
basis
points
or
percent
point
historically
the
economy
has
tended
to
enter
a
recession
after
the
spread
had
shrunk
below
zero
percent
inverting
the
yield
curve
the
fall
in
bonds
yields
came
despite
inflationary
pressure
stemming
from
rising
oil
prices
crude
futures
surged
percent
on
wednesday
rising
as
high
as
a
barrel
the
highest
since
on
signs
of
tight
supply
crude
stocks
fell
nearly
million
barrels
last
week
while
the
fall
in
canadian
exports
helped
drain
supplies
of
heavy
crude
across
north
america
the
demand
on
other
countries
to
cut
all
imports
of
iranian
oil
is
also
seen
as
fuelling
a
shortage
while
a
power
struggle
in
libya
has
left
it
unclear
whether
the
internationally
recognised
government
or
rebels
will
handle
oil
exports

a
low
of

tonne
in
the
currency
market
major
currencies
were
treading
water
on
uncertainties
over
the
escalating
trade
frictions
the
euro
was
hit
by
concerns
about
political
uncertainty
in
germany
although
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
coalition
partner
said
it
was
not
seeking
to
break
up
the
government
the

currency
stood
at
edging
near
an
low

the
