u.s. coal industry needs 'fundamental shift' to fight black lung -report
washington
reuters
coal
companies
need
to
make
a
fundamental
shift
in
how
they
control
exposure
to
coal
dust
in
underground
mines
to
address
the
recent
surge
in
black
lung
disease
rates
according
to
a
federal
report
released
thursday
the
national
academies
of
sciences
engineering
and
medicine
report
found
that
even
though
coal
operators
largely
comply
with
recently
tightened
rules
requiring
monitoring
for
coal
dust
those
measures
may
not
be
sufficient
there
is
an
urgent
need
for
monitoring
and
sampling
strategies
that
enable
continued
actual
progress
to
be
made
toward
the
elimination
of
diseases
associated
with
coal
mine
dust
exposure
said
thure
cerling
a
biology
professor
at
the
university
of
utah
who
helped
write
the
report
the
report
recommends
that
the
national
institute
for
occupational
safety
and
health
niosh
and
the
mining
safety
and
health
administration
msha
improve
monitoring
and
conduct
studies
on
the
causes
of
the
resurgence
in
the
disease
which
had
been
nearly
eradicated
in
the
cases
of
the
incurable
illness
caused
by
inhaling
coal
dust
are
rising
to
levels
not
seen
in
decades
as
miners
plumb
the
depths
of
coal
seams
using
heavy
blasting
equipment
according
to
government
health
officials
a
report
by
the
government
accountability
office
released
this
month
said
the
federal
fund
to
help
coal
miners
disabled
by
black
lung
disease
will
require
a
taxpayer
bailout
if
congress
does
not
extend
or
increase
the
tax
on
coal
production
that
funds
it
the
coal
industry
has
been
lobbying
congress
to
ensure
that
scheduled
reduction
in
the
tax
it
pays
into
that
fund
goes
forward
arguing
the
payments
have
already
been
too
high
the
nas
report
says
that
it
is
unclear
if
tougher
regulations
around
coal
dust
implemented
by
msha
in
are
effective
because
many
miners
with
black
lung
disease
got
the
ailment
from
exposure
that
occurred
years
earlier
it
is
important
to
note
that
compliance
with
regulatory
requirements
by
itself
is
not
an
adequate
indicator
of
the
rule
s
effectiveness
the
report
said
the
report
also
notes
that
while
the
rules
called
for
the
use
of
continuous
personal
dust
monitors
devices
that
warn
miners
if
dust
concentrations
are
too
high
only
a
small
fraction
of
miners
are
required
to
use
one
during
a
shift
research
and
development
efforts
will
also
be
crucial
for
better
understanding
the
effects
of
changes
in
mining
methods
on
miner
health
