analysis-saudi-russian axis rules oil markets as trump fights iran
reuters
iran
may
be
russia
s
ally
in
the
syrian
conflict
but
when
it
comes
to
oil
tehran
s
saudi
arabia
takes
precedence
if
last
week
s
opec
meeting
in
vienna
is
anything
to
go
by
iran
had
been
pushing
hard
for
oil
producers
to
hold
output
steady
as
sanctions
are
expected
to
hit
its
exports
meaning
tehran
had
little
to
gain
from
opec
production
increases
that
lower
oil
prices
and
cut
its
revenue
but
saudi
arabia
and
russia
had
other
ideas
according
to
three
sources
close
to
opec
and
russia
the
world
s
two
biggest
oil
exporters
agreed
in
may
to
work
hand
in
glove
to
engineer
a
sizeable
increase
in
oil
output
albeit
for
different
reasons
the
events
in
vienna
were
the
latest
example
of
how
russia
and
saudi
arabia
have
effectively
sidelined
opec
driving
policy
for
their
own
geopolitical
ends
and
in
the
case
of
saudi
arabia
often
at
the
behest
of
the
united
states
with
their
end
game
in
mind
russia
first
proposed
that
the
combined
output
of
opec
countries
and
allies
such
as
itself
should
jump
million
barrels
a
day
bpd
from
july
their
tactic
was
for
saudi
arabia
to
then
suggest
a
more
modest
rise
of
less
than
million
barrels
in
the
hope
it
would
be
acceptable
to
iran
the
three
sources
told
reuters
saudi
arabia
was
keen
to
raise
output
to
meet
calls
from
president
donald
trump
and
major
consumers
such
as
india
and
china
to
help
cool
oil
prices
and
avoid
shortages
according
to
saudi
officials
including
energy
minister
khalid
russia
meanwhile
was
under
pressure
from
its
own
energy
companies
to
lift
caps
on
output
and
fight
a
steep
rise
in
domestic
fuel
prices
that
was
hurting
president
vladimir
putin
s
popularity
according
to
two
russian
oil
industry
sources
in
the
end
saudi
arabia
pushed
through
a
rise
of
million
bpd
at
the
vienna
meeting
in
line
with
the
plan
it
had
agreed
with
moscow
more
than
a
month
earlier
while
russia
s
motivation
was
mainly
for
domestic
reasons
the
outcome
also
played
into
trump
s
hands
to
help
lower
domestic
fuel
prices
ahead
of
midterm
elections
opec
the
organization
that
triggered
the
oil
shock
of
by
restricting
supplies
to
countries
supporting
israel
in
the
yom
kippur
war
once
controlled
percent
to
percent
of
the
world
s
oil
supply
and
commanded
the
full
attention
of
markets
now
opec
produces
a
third
of
the
world
s
crude
while
saudi
arabia
combined
with
members
russia
and
the
united
states
pump
more
what
s
more
their
share
of
the
global
market
is
only
set
to
rise
giving
the
three
countries
even
more
influence
over
the
geopolitics
of
oil
in
a
bid
to
revive
oil
prices
after
they
fell
as
low
as
a
barrel
in
opec
and
its
allies
struck
a
deal
to
cut
oil
output
by
million
bpd
from
the
start
of
the
pact
rebalanced
the
market
and
lifted
crude
to
about
a
barrel
but
unexpected
outages
in
venezuela
libya
and
angola
have
effectively
increased
the
cuts
to
some
million
bpd
in
recent
months
and
sanctions
are
expected
to
cut
iran
s
output
by
a
third
all
threatening
to
push
crude
prices
ever
higher
saudi
arabia
insisted
as
recently
as
april
it
was
too
soon
to
open
the
taps
but
riyadh
made
a
after
its
ally
the
united
states
called
on
opec
to
boost
supplies
with
russia
on
the
same
wavelength
for
its
own
reasons
iran
had
to
be
persuaded
but
it
was
not
without
a
fight
and
some
from
riyadh
and
moscow
opec
sources
said
a
day
before
the
official
opec
meeting
on
friday
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
stormed
out
of
a
gathering
of
opec
and
allies
saying
there
would
be
no
agreement
but
a
last
minute
conversation
on
friday
morning
with
falih
and
saudi
minister
of
state
for
energy
affairs
prince
abdulaziz
helped
convince
zanganeh
according
to
three
opec
sources
a
veteran
of
opec
diplomacy
for
more
than
two
decades
the
prince
a
son
of
king
salman
was
instrumental
in
getting
the
initial
production
pact
together
in
the
saudi
ministers
thought
they
had
a
reasonable
case
opec
needed
to
act
to
tame
high
oil
prices
hurting
consumers
and
if
zanganeh
refused
to
sign
up
iran
risked
being
isolated
by
other
producers
who
would
increase
production
anyway
sources
said
zanganeh
was
also
told
if
the
deal
was
blocked
by
iran
it
may
lead
to
the
withdrawal
of
russia
from
the
agreement
the
sources
said
one
of
tehran
s
closest
allies
moscow
is
helping
iran
fight
to
keep
syrian
president
bashar
in
power
one
russian
energy
source
said
iran
was
also
keen
to
keep
moscow
on
side
because
it
hopes
russia
will
be
able
to
help
it
sell
crude
as
the
sanctions
bite
the
existing
opec
deal
dating
back
from
gave
iran
a
production
quota
of
million
barrels
per
day
keeping
that
deal
intact
was
crucial
to
zanganeh
opec
sources
said
excluding
iran
from
the
new
deal
would
mean
a
loss
of
that
output
quota
we
have
countries
in
the
agreement
they
can
always
be
one
of
the
opec
sources
said
kuwait
oman
and
the
united
arab
emirates
also
participated
in
efforts
to
convince
iran
according
to
opec
sources
events
since
the
meeting
have
further
underlined
how
opec
members
are
increasingly
being
left
out
of
crucial
production
decisions
being
taken
by
saudi
arabia
and
russia
when
trump
slapped
fresh
sanctions
on
iran
in
may
saudi
arabia
issued
a
statement
the
same
day
saying
it
was
prepared
to
meet
any
supply
shortage
riyadh
was
briefed
by
washington
a
day
before
the
sanctions
and
was
asked
to
issue
the
statement
reuters
reported
earlier
this
month
when
washington
said
this
week
it
was
asking
customers
in
asia
and
europe
to
reduce
iranian
oil
purchases
to
zero
from
november
sources
familiar
with
saudi
oil
thinking
briefed
the
market
about
an
imminent
rise
in
saudi
output
to
a
record
it
was
not
clear
whether
washington
briefed
riyadh
this
time
or
whether
it
asked
it
to
issue
a
new
statement
but
as
the
news
about
a
jump
in
saudi
output
filtered
out
oil
prices
cooled
the
saudi
announcement
took
most
opec
members
and
especially
iran
by
surprise
even
though
the
opec
decision
a
week
earlier
was
kept
deliberately
vague
last
week
for
both
iran
and
saudi
to
compromise
falih
had
promised
to
only
gradually
increase
its
supply
by
a
few
hundreds
of
thousands
of
barrels
on
tuesday
sources
said
saudi
output
would
rise
to
a
new
record
of
million
bpd
as
early
as
july
a
whole
million
bpd
above
may
immediately
triggering
a
protest
from
iran
the
state
department
says
it
is
short
and
saudi
arabia
says
they
will
produce
million
bpd
in
july
i
regret
to
say
they
are
both
ridiculing
our
organization
iran
s
opec
governor
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
told
reuters
on
thursday
saudi
sources
said
the
kingdom
s
oil
output
had
already
started
rising
substantially
above
its
quota
in
june
before
the
opec
meeting
the
only
other
oil
producing
country
to
boost
production
above
its
quota
in
june
