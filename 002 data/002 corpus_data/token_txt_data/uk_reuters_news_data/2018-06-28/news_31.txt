if

becomes
bigger

bigger

said
pau
london
capital
s
chief
investment
officer
you
could
see
tech
stocks
taking
a
lot
of
impact
and
you
could
see
some
big
negative
numbers
on
the
main
indexes
though
he
added
he
did
not
expect
the
situation
to
escalate
to
a
crisis
at
this
point
there
were
other
signs
too
that
markets
were
shaken
by
the
economic
impact
of
the
trade
conflict
treasury
and
german
bund
yields
remained
near
lows
as
investors
moved
into
bonds
for
the
guaranteed
returns
stocks
can
not
offer
the
to
yield
curve
whose
flattening
can
be
an
early
warning
of
recessions
stayed
near
the
low
of
basis
points
it
had
hit
on
wednesday
a
dip
in
italian
yields
after
it
a
key
bond
sale
there
did
suggest
some
risk
appetite
was
returning
though
traders
were
also
eyeing
a
meeting
of
european
union
leaders
likely
to
lay
bare
the
bloc
s
divisions
on
immigration
it
could
prove
disruptive
to
markets
as
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
a
stalwart
through
various
recent
euro
zone
crises
seeks
a
broad
agreement
which
looks
like
proving
tricky
look
for
any
clues
on
how
italy
positions
itself
here
because
it
could
have
implications
for
its
budget
said
ing
euro
zone
economist
bert
colijn
if
they
are
constructive
and
cooperative
with
some
of
the
european
leaders
here
then
it
seems
likely
that
what
finance
minister
giovanni
tria
is
saying
is
true
that
they
are
going
to
be
working
towards
a
budget
that
falls
within
the
lines
of
what
the
commission
would
require
them
to
analysts
earlier
cited
italian
reports
that
tax
cuts
and
a
citizens
income
plan
would
not
be
introduced
next
year
as
another
factor
boosting
italian
government
bonds
two
main
forces
were
playing
out
in
the
currency
markets
the
trade
tensions
initially
pushed
the
dollar
seen
as
one
of
the
safest
investments
especially
if
interest
rates
keep
rising
to
test
a
high
against
a
basket
of
other
top
currencies
the
gains
fizzled
out
by
the
middle
of
the
european
session
after
rising
inflation
in
some
german
regions
prompted
some
traders
to
buy
the
euro
again
that
helped
relieve
the
pressure
on
emerging
market
currencies
like
the
turkish
lira
and
south
african
rand
which
had
tanked
earlier
in
their
local
markets
after
higher
oil
prices
raised
growth
and
inflation
concerns
it
had
come
early
enough
for
asia
though
the
indian
rupee
hit
a
record
low
of
to
the
dollar
while
indonesia
s
rupiah
slumped
as
much
as
percent
to
touch
its
weakest
since
october
a
reuters
poll
also
showed
investors
have
raised
their
short
positions
in
asian
currencies
over
the
past
month
with
bets
on
the
chinese
yuan
turning
bearish
for
the
first
time
in
over
a
year
as
trade
tensions
intensify
crude
futures
had
surged
percent
on
wednesday
rising
to
as
much
as
a
barrel
the
highest
since
november
on
signs
of
tight
supply
crude
stocks
fell
nearly
million
barrels
last
week
while
a
fall
in
canadian
exports
helped
drain
supplies
of
heavy
crude
across
north
america
white
house
pressure
on
other
countries
to
stop
all
imports
of
iranian
oil
is
seen
as
creating
a
shortage
and
a
power
struggle
in
libya
has
left
it
unclear
whether
its
internationally
recognised
government
or
rebels
will
handle
oil
exports
crude
futures
traded
back
a
touch
at
a
barrel
while
global
benchmark
brent
was
cents
lower
at
a
number
of
people
will
be
revising
higher
their
assumptions
for
the
loss
of
iranian
barrels
harry
tchilinguirian
strategist
at
french
bank
bnp
paribas
told
reuters
global
oil
forum
if
we
assume
that
opec
and
its
allies
will
deliver
a
near
million
barrels

bpd
increase
in
production
most
of
it
will
