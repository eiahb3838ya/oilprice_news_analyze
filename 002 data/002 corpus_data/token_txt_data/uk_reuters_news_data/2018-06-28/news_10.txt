transcanada urges u.s. to help gas pipelines beat green critics
june
reuters
the
united
states
should
help
the
natural
gas
industry
overcome
environmental
challenges
to
new
pipeline
projects
by
adjusting
regulations
or
adopting
new
laws
favoring
infrastructure
an
executive
at
transcanada
corp
said
at
a
conference
this
week
suppliers
in
the
united
states
the
world
s
biggest
natural
gas
producer
have
had
a
harder
time
getting
shipments
to
market
as
more
environmental
lawsuits
by
states
green
groups
and
property
owners
have
tied
up
pipeline
construction
it
s
definitely
not
getting
easier
to
build
a
new
pipeline
stanley
chapman
executive
vice
president
and
president
of
natural
gas
pipelines
at
transcanada
corp
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
at
the
world
gas
conference
in
washington
i
m
seeing
more
pipeline
projects
that
are
under
construction
get
held
up
by
a
judge
in
lawsuits
and
this
has
to
be
addressed
either
by
ferc
or
with
legislation
he
said
ferc
or
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
oversees
construction
of
new
pipelines
transcanada
owns
about
miles
of
gas
pipeline
in
the
united
states
making
it
one
of
the
country
s
biggest
operators
it
has
been
trying
for
more
than
a
decade
to
build
its
keystone
xl
oil
pipeline
project
linking
canada
s
oil
sands
to
refineries
amid
ongoing
environmental
delays
ferc
in
april
asked
stakeholders
to
submit
comments
on
whether
the
commission
should
revise
existing
pipeline
approval
policies
something
that
has
yielded
feedback
from
industry
backers
i
have
encouraged
the
ferc
commissioners
that
if
they
move
forward
in
revising
this
policy
they
should
focus
on
timely
review
and
approval
or
disapproval
of
pipeline
certificates
senator
shelley
moore
capito
republican
of
west
virginia
said
at
the
world
gas
conference
she
said
it
was
tough
for
energy
firms
to
invest
in
new
pipelines
when
every
regulatory
action
yields
a
lawsuit
that
leaves
no
project
safe
from
the
retroactive
pulling
of
in
recent
weeks
environmental
groups
like
the
sierra
club
have
won
court
orders
delaying
construction
on
eqt
midstream
partners
lp
s
mountain
valley
pipeline
at
several
locations
in
west
virginia
through
federal
lawsuits
and
are
now
seeking
a
court
order
to
also
stop
construction
in
virginia
eqt
said
it
was
disappointed
and
was
evaluating
legal
and
regulatory
options
to
continue
construction
mountain
valley
links
west
virginia
and
virginia
it
is
one
of
several
pipelines
under
construction
to
transport
gas
from
the
marcellus
and
utica
shale
formations
in
pennsylvania
west
virginia
and
ohio
to
consumers
in
the
southeast
gulf
coast
and
midwest
where
gas
demand
is
growing
fast
especially
for
power
generation
and
lng
export
the
sierra
club
says
the
united
states
should
focus
on
clean
energy
sources
like
wind
and
solar
we
don
t
need
these
pipelines
to
meet
our
energy
needs
so
it
makes
no
sense
to
lock
us
into
generations
of
dependence
on
dirty
fossil
fuels
said
joan
walker
who
helps
lead
the
sierra
club
s
beyond
dirty
fuels
campaign
walker
said
she
believe
ferc
currently
acts
as
a
rubber
stamp
for
energy
infrastructure
projects
the
united
states
is
the
world
s
biggest
producer
and
consumer
of
natural
gas
and
is
on
the
cusp
of
becoming
one
of
its
top
exporters
production
in
the
marcellus
and
utica
the
biggest
shale
gas
formations
in
the
united
states
has
ballooned
to
billion
cubic
feet
per
day
bcfd
from
bcfd
a
decade
ago
according
to
federal
energy
data
one
billion
cubic
feet
is
enough
to
fuel
about
million
homes
for
a
day
the
boom
came
as
producers
figured
out
how
to
use
hydraulic
fracturing
and
horizontal
drilling
to
unlock
the
gas
from
the
rocks
the
industry
is
eyeing
growing
export
markets
by
investing
in
facilities
that
can
liquefy
gas
for
shipment
overseas
the
united
states
has
sent
cargoes
to
nearly
countries
in
the
past
year
capito
said
it
was
ironic
that
gas
is
headed
around
the
world
but
struggles
to
reach
new
england
right
now
gas
from
the
marcellus
and
utica
shale
is
being
blocked
by
some
of
our
neighboring
states
which
cuts
off
our
markets
in
new
england
she
said
new
york
has
denied
water
permits
for
a
few
pipelines
that
would
move
gas
into
the
state
from
pennsylvania
including
williams

and

the

dec
said
the
department
subjects
all
applications
for
environmental
permits
to
an
extensive
and
transparent
review
process
designed
to
deny
any
permit
that
is
found
not
to
be
protective
of

the
