saudi
basic
industries
corp
sabic
is
considering
increasing
its
holding
in
clariant
and
pursuing
joint
ventures
as
the
saudi
firm
looks
to
strengthen
ties
with
the
swiss
chemicals
group
sources
told
reuters
the
world
s
number
four
chemical
firm
bought
a
percent
stake
in
clariant
this
year
and
is
expected
to
intensify
research
and
development
with
the
swiss
specialty
chemicals
maker
as
well
as
hike
its
stake
over
time
the
sources
said
it
already
has
a
new
partnership
with
clariant
that
licenses
chemical
process
technology
to
customers
including
huntsman
and
akzo
nobel
sabic
s
narrative
is
clearly
not
to
stay
at
percent
and
do
nothing
a
person
close
to
the
matter
said
adding
that
a
combination
of
businesses
would
precede
any
potential
merger
in
january
sabic
said
it
had
no
current
plans
to
launch
a
full
takeover
of
clariant
however
the
group
wants
to
extract
value
from
its
investment
in
a
friendly
manner
the
sources
said
adding
that
it
does
not
want
to
be
perceived
as
an
aggressive
acquirer
and
any
attempt
to
hike
its
stake
may
take
time
sabic
declined
to
comment
while
a
spokesman
for
clariant
said
it
was
in
ongoing
talks
with
sabic
about
possible
future
collaboration
prospects
and
any
outcome
would
be
communicated
at
the
appropriate
time
middle
eastern
firms
have
been
eager
to
expand
into
advanced
downstream
chemicals
operations
like
the
catalysts
that
clariant
produces
to
help
speed
up
processes
at
chemicals
plants
saudi
oil
company
saudi
aramco
in
bought
half
the
synthetic
rubber
business
of
germany
s
lanxess
for
around
billion
euros
the
moves
show
that
saudi
companies
are
increasingly
trying
to
raise
their
influence
outside
the
kingdom
as
part
of
the
ambitious
vision
plan
which
was
set
out
by
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
to
diversify
the
country
s
economy
from
oil
sabic
which
is
percent
owned
by
saudi
arabia
s
public
investment
fund
sovereign
wealth
fund
would
initially
stop
short
of
taking
control
of
clariant
which
has
a
market
value
of
billion
the
sources
said
under
swiss
takeover
rules
anybody
with
percent
of
the
shares
would
have
to
make
an
offer
for
the
full
company
while
sabic
s
purchase
of
a
stake
in
clariant
ended
the
swiss
firm
s
fight
with
activist
investors
it
must
be
vetted
by
regulators
in
countries
including
brazil
germany
and
austria
the
sources
said
the
deal
would
be
cleared
during
the
summer
and
would
pave
the
way
to
the
implementation
of
closer
ties
clariant
s
boss
hariolf
kottmann
told
investors
in
march
that
management
viewed
sabic
s
commitment
as
very
positive
and
a
strategic
update
would
be
provided
in
september
plastics
production
is
an
area
where
sabic
may
implement
closer
ties
with
clariant
two
of
the
sources
said
sabic
has
a
strong
plastics
business
since
its
billion
purchase
of
ge
plastics
in
and
a
combination
with
clariant
s
would
make
sense
one
of
the
sources
said
plastics
coatings
accounts
for
more
than
percent
of
clariant
s
billion
francs
in
annual
sales
although
the
division
s
revenue
grew
by
percent
last
year
producing
much
of
clariant
s
cash
flow
its
profitability
trails
that
of
divisions
like
catalysts
and
care
chemicals
which
include
soap
and
shampoo
ingredients
last
year
clariant
abandoned
a
billion
deal
with
group
huntsman
to
create
the
world
s
specialty
chemicals
maker
behind
evonik
after
opposition
from
activist
investors
