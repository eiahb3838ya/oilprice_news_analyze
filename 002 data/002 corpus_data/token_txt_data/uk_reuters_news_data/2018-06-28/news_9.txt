outlined

the

down

treasury

german
bund
yields
remained
near

as
investors
moved
into

for
the
guaranteed
returns
stocks
can
not
offer
the
yield
curve
between

treasury
notes
traded
just
above
the
low

basis
points
reached
on
wednesday
which
was
the
flattest
since
a
battle
over

policy
in
germany
s
coalition
government
additionally
boosted
demand
for

raising
concerns
that
the

the

amid
trade
tensions
gold
fell
to
its
lowest
level
in
more

on
mounting
pressure
from

usually
help
gold
they
have
failed

this
time
oil
prices
rose
to

bolstered
by
supply
concerns
due
to
sanctions
that
