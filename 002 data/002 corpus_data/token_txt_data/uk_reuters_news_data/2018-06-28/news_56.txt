wind
turbine
maker
vestas
and
offshore
services
firm
maersk
supply
service
part
of
are
teaming
up
to
tackle
the
cost
of
transporting
and
installing
ever
larger
wind
turbines
the
two
companies
said
on
thursday
the
initial
focus
of
the
partnership
would
be
on
developing
a
new
crane
to
manoeuvre
and
install
turbines
that
are
sometimes
taller
than
skyscrapers
the
crane
will
be
developed
in
cooperation
with
mhi
vestas
an
offshore
wind
joint
venture
between
vestas
and
mitsubishi
heavy
industries
bigger
turbines
are
crucial
as
the
offshore
wind
industry
seeks
to
remain
profitable
after
european
countries
phase
out
subsidies
that
have
provided
support
since
the
last
year
mhi
vestas
launched
a
megawatts
mw
offshore
turbine
currently
the
world
s
most
powerful
wind
turbine
but
bigger
ones
are
expected
in
the
future
general
electric
is
working
to
develop
a
mw
turbine
that
will
stand
metres
feet
tall
the
challenge
for
the
industry
is
that
installation
and
logistics
around
the
turbines
become
a
greater
share
of
the
costs
bo
svoldgaard
vestas
head
of
innovation
and
concepts
told
reuters
for
maersk
supply
service
the
partnership
could
open
up
new
revenue
streams
outside
the
struggling
oil
service
industry
at
a
time
when
the
business
is
up
for
sale
as
part
of
maersk
s
transformation
from
conglomerate
to
a
focused
shipping
firm
a
prototype
of
the
crane
is
expected
in
the
fourth
quarter
next
year
with
production
starting
in
two
to
three
years
svoldgaard
said
both
companies
declined
to
comment
on
the
size
of
investment
into
the
new
partnership
