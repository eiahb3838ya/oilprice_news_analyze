opec
is
changing
fundamentally
as
power
in
the
oil
market
shifts
towards
saudi
arabia
acting
in
concert
with
russia
while
the
other
members
of
the
organisation
are
increasingly
marginalised
in
theory
all
members
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
countries
are
equal
and
the
group
has
always
taken
decisions
by
consensus
statute
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
opec
s
founding
statute
stipulates
that
it
shall
be
guided
by
the
principle
of
sovereign
equality
of
its
member
countries
article
in
practice
some
members
of
opec
have
always
been
more
powerful
than
others
but
that
imbalance
has
been
widening
with
saudi
arabia
becoming
the
dominant
saudi
arabia
s
oil
production
overtook
iran
s
in
the
and
the
gap
has
grown
steadily
wider
as
a
result
of
the
iranian
revolution
the
war
and
multiple
rounds
of
sanctions
saudi
arabia
is
the
only
member
of
the
organisation
with
a
large
enough
share
of
output
to
have
a
measurable
influence
prices
and
the
budgetary
flexibility
to
adjust
its
production
significantly
in
reality
saudi
arabia
decides
how
much
to
produce
given
market
conditions
playing
the
role
of
swing
producer
while
the
other
members
of
the
organisation
essentially
produce
as
much
as
they
are
technically
able
since
the
late
saudi
arabia
has
increasingly
coordinated
production
policy
with
neighbouring
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
largely
ending
their
former
rivalry
and
accusations
of
cheating
these
three
gulf
countries
have
become
the
core
of
opec
with
the
other
members
playing
a
peripheral
role
in
output
policy
the
balance
of
power
within
opec
has
been
shifting
towards
saudi
arabia
and
its
allies
for
the
last
years
but
production
problems
in
other
member
countries
have
accelerated
the
trend
in
recent
years
venezuela
s
output
has
fallen
sharply
as
a
result
of
mismanagement
and
internal
unrest
libya
s
production
has
been
cut
by
the
country
s
civil
war
nigeria
and
angola
are
suffering
from
chronic
production
problems
iran
s
output
has
been
hampered
by
repeated
rounds
of
sanctions
iraq
is
the
only
opec
member
which
has
experienced
a
significant
increase
in
output
since
the
country
has
recovered
from
the
invasion
and
ensuing
internal
security
problems
but
iraq
has
always
attempted
to
maximise
output
because
of
its
enormous
need
for
revenues
to
meet
heavy
budget
commitments
and
it
plays
little
practical
role
in
opec
s
production
policy
since
saudi
arabia
and
its
key
allies
have
consistently
accounted
for
around
percent
of
total
opec
output
statistical
review
of
world
energy
bp
more
importantly
saudi
arabia
and
its
allies
account
for
almost
all
the
organisation
s
spare
production
capacity
and
therefore
almost
all
its
production
flexibility
saudi
arabia
and
its
allies
accounted
for
most
of
the
voluntary
production
cuts
implemented
during
and
now
hold
most
of
the
spare

that
could
be
made
available

around

of
unused

capacity
while
the
uae
has
around
bpd
and
kuwait
around
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
most
other
members
of
the
organisation
have
only
negligible
amounts
of
unused
capacity
that
could
be
readily
and
reliably
available
to
the
market
oil

june
and
among
the
three
gulf
allies
saudi
arabia
has
by
far
the
largest
production
and
unused
capacity
cementing
its
role
as
the
de
facto
leader
of
opec
opec
s
biggest
problem
in
attempting
to
manage
the
oil
market
has
always
been
its
inability
to
control
production
from
countries
which
remain
outside
the
organisation
opec
s
efforts
to
stabilise
and
raise
prices
have
frequently
been
undermined
by
the
growth
of
alternative
sources
of
supply

china
the
soviet
union

saudi
arabia
as
opec
leader
has
made
repeated
overtures
to
countries
since
the
to
restrain
their
production
with
uneven
success
since
however
saudi
arabia
has
forged
an
effective
working
relationship
with
russia
and
a
group
of
other
smaller
producers
to
limit
output
just
as
saudi
arabia
has
dominated
opec
russia
dominates
the
group
of
allies
contributing
most
of
the
output
production
cuts
and
spare
capacity
in
effect
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
emerged
as
joint
market
managers
with
other
opec
and
countries
relegated
to
a
marginal
role
opec
is
no
longer
the
primary
forum
for
producing
countries
trying
to
coordinate
policy
on
output
and
prices
real
power
has
passed
from
opec
and
its
group
of
allies
into
the
hands
of
saudi
arabia
and
russia
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
been
careful
to
maintain
the
formal
involvement
of
opec
and
the
wider
group
of
countries
known
as
but
the
real
decisions
on
production
policy
are
now
being
made
bilaterally
and
outside
the
opec
and
structures
the
marginalisation
of
opec
as
a
formal
group
was
evident
during
the
organisation
s
meetings
in
vienna
between
june
and
june
despite
four
days
of
discussions
opec
and
failed
to
reach
a
detailed
agreement
on
production
policy
in
the
second
half
of
the
final
communiques
issued
after
the
opec
and
meetings
did
not
specify
either
a
formal
output
ceiling
or
country
allocations
instead
it
was
left
to
saudi
and
russian
officials
to
brief
the
media
afterwards
that
collective
output
would
increase
by
around
million
bpd
saudi
arabia
and
russia
will
contribute
almost
all
the
increase
in
output
with
smaller
contributions
from
kuwait
and
the
uae
in
theory
this
decision
was
taken
by
consensus
among
opec
and
members
with
iran
and
other
members
persuaded
to
give
their
assent
to
a
vague
joint
statement
in
practice
saudi
arabia
and
russia
are
likely
to
have
increased
their
production
by
million
bpd
whether
other
opec
and
countries
agreed
or
not
if
iran
or
any
other
country
had
walked
out
of
the
discussions
it
would
not
have
made
any
practical
difference
to
the
amount
of
oil
supplied
to
the
market
in
the
second
half
of
saudi
arabia
is
keen
to
maintain
the
formal
structure
of
opec
and
cooperation
the
consensus
outcome
of
the
meetings
was
an
important
step
towards
that
objective
but
the
preservation
of
the
group
masks
the
fact
real
power
in
the
oil
market
has
shifted
decisively
to
saudi
arabia
and
russia
with
some
political
input
from
the
united
states
saudi
and
russian
market
power
will
become
even
more
evident
in
the
second
half
of
if
the
two
countries
proceed
with
the
agreed
increase
in
production
assuming
saudi
arabia
and
its
two
gulf
allies
increase
their
combined
production
by
bpd
their
share
of
total
opec
output
will
climb
above
percent
for
the
first
time
since
the
and
if
venezuela
s
output
continues
to
fall
which
seems
likely
and
iran
s
production
is
curbed
by
sanctions
the
three
gulf
allies
will
see
their
share
of
opec
output
climb
to
the
highest
level
since
by
the
oil
market
will
have
less
than
million
bpd
of
spare
production
capacity
essentially
all
of
it
located
in
saudi
arabia
saudi
arabia
will
exercise
more
market
power
than
at
any
time
since
the
iranian
revolution
and
iraq
s
invasion
caused
iranian
output
to
plummet
in
market
power
will
be
in
the
hands
of
saudi
arabia
and
to
a
lesser
extent
russia
not
opec
or
the
broader
group
the
formal
structures
of
opec
and
will
remain
but
real
power
has
shifted
elsewhere
