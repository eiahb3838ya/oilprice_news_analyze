reuters
volkswagen
s
labor
chief
bernd
osterloh
said
the
german
carmaker
needed
to
sell
million
electric
cars
by
to
comply
with
proposed
european
union
rules
a
step
which
may
ruin
profits
european
lawmakers
will
vote
on
tightening
emissions
rules
in
july
to
help
the
bloc
cut
overall
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
at
least
percent
below
levels
by
of
course
the
auto
industry
has
some
homework
to
do
but
if
the
infrastructure
is
not
there
then
it
is
difficult
to
convince
a
person
to
buy
an
electric
car
osterloh
told
the
stuttgart
press
club
carmakers
say
governments
need
to
help
subsidize
the
roll
out
of
essential
infrastructure
such
as
charging
points
on
streets
and
in
homes
to
help
make
the
vehicles
popular
osterloh
who
spoke
on
wednesday
said
the
industry
would
struggle
if
electric
cars
did
not
gain
traction
with
consumers
given
the
investment
companies
were
having
to
make
to
develop
the
new
vehicles
he
said
without
sufficient
demand
from
consumers
carmakers
faced
a
choice
between
paying
fines
for
exceeding
carbon
dioxide
limits
or
encouraging
sales
with
prices
too
low
to
earn
a
profit
once
prices
are
ruined
we
will
never
get
them
back
up
