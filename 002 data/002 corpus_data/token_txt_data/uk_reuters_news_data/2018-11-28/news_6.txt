brazil
s
latest
policy
to
boost
biofuels
use
has
improved
the
outlook
for
ethanol
production
and
should
attract
new
investment
in
plants
bp
plc
s
chief
executive
for
biofuels
mario
lindenhayn
said
on
wednesday
brazil
is
advancing
with
additional
regulation
for
the
policy
called
renovabio
and
expected
to
be
enacted
in
lindenhayn
said
adding
that
he
does
not
see
signs
that
the
government
of
jair
bolsonaro
which
kicks
off
in
january
would
put
up
obstacles
we
are
very
positive
this
is
a
very
important
signal
the
country
is
giving
creating
a
stable
regulatory
environment
that
will
allow
companies
to
invest
lindenhayn
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
an
energy
presentation
at
the
company
s
corporate
office
in
sao
paulo
renovabio
will
mandate
fuel
distributors
to
gradually
increase
the
amount
of
biofuels
they
sell
the
programme
aims
to
double
the
use
of
ethanol
by
from
around
billion
litres
currently
the
programme
also
targets
increases
for
other
renewables
such
as
biodiesel
bp
has
three
ethanol
mills
in
brazil
crushing
million
tonnes
of
sugar
cane
per
year
it
formed
a
venture
last
year
with
brazil
s
copersucar
a
leading
global
ethanol
seller
to
jointly
operate
one
of
the
largest
fuel
terminals
in
the
country
located
in
paulínia
in
sao
paulo
state
lindenhayn
said
the
programme
provides
an
opportunity
for
mills
in
brazil
which
have
experienced
stagnation
caused
by
years
of
low
sugar
prices
and
a
long
period
of
subsidized
gasoline
prices
that
led
to
the
closure
of
many
firms
if
the
programme
advances
as
planned
it
will
be
a
large
opportunity
there
are
no
greenfield
projects
around
and
the
country
is
a
net
fuel
importer
he
said
asked
if
bp
would
be
interested
in
increasing
ethanol
capacity
via
acquisitions
since
there
are
several
assets
being
offered
in
brazil
by
companies
with
financial
difficulties
lindenhayn
said
we
will
see
we
will
on
wednesday
brazilian
oil
and
fuels
regulator
anp
published
in
the
official
gazette
another
part
of
renovabio
complementary
legislation
with
rules
for
biofuel
companies
to
obtain
certification
with
that
the
plants
will
be
able
to
issue
and
trade
emissions
reductions
credits
called
cbios
that
fuel
distributors
could
buy
to
comply
with
targets
in
case
they
fall
short
it
would
be
brazil
s
first
emissions
reductions
market
although
limited
to
the
fuels
industry
