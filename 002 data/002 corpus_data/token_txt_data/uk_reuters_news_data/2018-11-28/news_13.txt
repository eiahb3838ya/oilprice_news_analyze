hopes
for
a
thaw
in
trade
ties
at
the
upcoming
summit
helped
world
shares
inch
to
a
high
on
wednesday
though
fears
of
a
outcome
weighed
on
european
bourses
and
kept
the
dollar
firm
for
the
fourth
day
in
a
row
while
president
donald
trump
talked
tough
on
the
trade
tariffs
issue
ahead
of
a
meeting
with
chinese
president
xi
jinping
on
saturday
markets
focused
on
comments
by
white
house
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
who
held
open
the
possibility
that
the
two
countries
would
reach
a
trade
deal
a
rapprochement
is
seen
as
crucial
given
that
world
growth
and
trade
are
already
showing
signs
of
an
alarming
slowdown
kudlow
s
comments
allowed
chinese
and
japanese
shares
to
rally

while
msci
s
equity
index
was
up

and
the

futures

opening

with
the

nasdaq
and
dow
jones
tipped

rise
between

there
was
some
caution
however
especially
in
europe
which
was
hit
on
tuesday
by
a
report
that
trump
may
soon
decide
about
new
taxes
on
imported
cars
europe
s
auto
sector
shares
were

in

an
expectation
is
being
priced
into
markets
ahead
of
the
meeting
that
we
will
see
some
deal
or
at
least
a
framework
for
a
deal
between
trump
and
xi
jinping
said
bernd
berg
global
macro
strategist
at
woodman
asset
management
but
if
they
come
out
with
nothing
this
weekend
it
s
going
to
be
very
the
uncertainty
over
global
trade
as
well
as
brexit
and
italy
s
conflict
with
the
european
union
are
supporting
the
dollar
which
is
at
a
high
against
a
basket
of
currencies
while
the
main
driver
for
the
greenback
is
the
interest
rate
path
rodrigo
catril
senior
strategist
at
national
australia
bank
said
it
was
also
benefiting
from
the
uncertain
mood
markets
seem
to
be
jumping
at
shadows
at
the
moment
and
against
this
backdrop
of
uncertainty
the
dollar
remains
the
preferred
option
for
weathering
the
storm
catril
said
with
the
currency
index
approaching
highs
reached
earlier
this
month
traders
are
focusing
on
a
speech
at
gmt
by
federal
reserve
chair
jerome
powell
to
see
if
he
offers
clues
on
how
many
more
times
the
fed
could
raise
interest
rates
while
fed
vice
chair
richard
clarida
took
a
less
dovish
stance
on
tuesday
than
some
had
expected
and
backed
more
rate
rises
powell
and
his
colleagues
have
in
recent
weeks
alluded
to
global
volatility
leading
many
to
speculate
the
bank
s
rate
rise
campaign
could
pause
in
however
most
reckon
the
fed
is
on
track
to
tighten
policy
in
december
and
at
least
my
base
case
is
the
dollar
will
strengthen
versus
the
euro
and
pound
into
as
the
euro
zone
and
britain
are
both
struggling
with
their
own
problems
brexit

italy

mcdonnell
s
comments
raise
hopes
that
the

will
more
firmly
back
putting
the
brexit
