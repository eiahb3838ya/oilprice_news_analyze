it
is
one
of
several
companies
trying
new
ideas
to
win
business
in
the
market
for
dismantling
disused

in
britain
aging

fields
alone
the
opportunities
could
be
worth
up
to

according
to

body

the
ideas
could
then
be
deployed
to
other
maturing
fields
such
as
in
the
gulf

and
southeast
offshore
decommissioning
ardent
says
it
needs
at
least
two
companies
to
sign
up
for
a
project
to
get
off
the
ground
another
company
offering
a
new
approach
also
needs
several
operators
to
commit
so
far
ardent
has
found
it
challenging
to
persuade
companies
to
be
the
first
to
sign
up
everyone
is
queuing
to
be
second
said
ardent
s
decommissioning
director
stuart
martin
oil
companies
are
keen
to
reduce
costs
in
a
part
of
the
market
dominated
by
major
global
players
such
as
technipfmc
schlumberger
saipem
and
allseas
beyond
the
floating
tanks
ardent
has
also
joined
forces
with
oil
services
firm
worleyparsons
and
technology
and
shipping
group
lloyd
s
register
to
bring
a
service
this
could
save
money
by
cutting
out
the
need
for
lots
of
different
contractors
proposes
coordinating
decommissioning
work
across
companies
to
share
equipment
and
staff
you
got
to
give
and
the
others
a
real
tip
of
the
hat
we
all
want
them
to
win
it
s
in
the
best
interest
of
the
industry
said
jim
house
ceo
of
neptune
energy
which
is
planning
decommissioning
for
its
juliet
and
minke
fields
in
the
north
sea
oil
platforms
are
usually
removed
piece
by
piece
and
taken
to
the
shore
using
complex
vessels
the
floating
tanks
that
ardent
used
to
lift
the
costa
concordia
are
much
cheaper
to
use
industry
experts
say
this
technology
could
have
significant
potential
cost
efficiencies
the
oil
and
gas
technology
centre
which
is
funded
by
the
british
government
said
in
a
report
but
ardent
says
it
would
need
contracts
for
at
least
two
buoyant
tanks
to
go
below
current
costs
per
tonne
of
steel
removed
and
three
to
get
below
its
target
cost
reduction
of
around
a
third
britain
s
industry
regulator
the
oil
and
gas
authority
has
set
a
target
of
percent
cost
cuts
compared
with
levels
s
main
lever
for
cost
reduction
also
depends
on
several
operators
committing
to
contracts
ardent
is
also
proposing
to
oversee
a
project
from
production
to
scrapping
the
metal
onshore
worley
parsons
would
operate
the
platform
and
maintain
the
equipment
and
lloyd
s
register
would
plug
the
wells
it
s
a
lot
about
an
emerging
set
of
companies
and
we
don
t
yet
know
which
is
going
to
be
the
winning
model
said
boston
consulting
group
s
philip
whittaker
one
of
the
biggest
sources
of

is
how
to

some
experts
expecting

to
peak
in
the
the
north
sea
is
a
test
bed
for
new
decommissioning
projects
if
a
company
can
plug
oil
wells
without
leaks
and
remove
thousands
of
tonnes
of
steel
platforms
and
pipelines
some

said
joe
leask
decommissioning
manager
at

those
resources
and
expertise
can
be
exportable
the
gulf
of
mexico
has
had
decommissioning
projects
in
its
warm
calm
waters
for
years
but
southeast
asia
is
a
new
hot
spot
with
more
than
platforms
and
subsea
wells
expected
to
be
uneconomical
by
according
to
the
bcg
that
is
followed
by
latin
america
west
africa
and
the
middle
east
future
decommissioning
hotspots
with
so
much
potential
more
established
players
are
also
trying
different
approaches
to
make
decommissioning
cheaper
service
vessel
group
allseas
is
experimenting
with
new

it
specializes
in
subsea
construction
but
is
converting
huge
ships
to
lift
structures
as
heavy
as
tonnes
in
one
haul
we
lift
in
a
matter
of
hours
and
we

said

the
