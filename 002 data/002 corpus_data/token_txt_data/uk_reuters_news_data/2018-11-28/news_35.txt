brazil
s
government
has
backed
out
of
its
offer
to
host
the
united
nations
climate
conference
next
year
due
to
budget
constraints
and
a
presidential
transition
brazil
s
foreign
ministry
said
on
wednesday
the
conference
is
slated
to
be
held
in
november
next
year
last
month
the
foreign
ministry
announced
brazil
s
offer
to
host
the
event
in
a
press
release
saying
the
meeting
would
work
out
final
details
of
the
paris
climate
agreement
and
for
signatory
countries
to
fully
implement
its
demands
by
hosting
the
event
would
have
confirmed
brazil
s
role
as
a
world
leader
on
sustainable
development
issues
especially
in
relation
to
climate
but
in
its
emailed
statement
on
wednesday
the
ministry
said
that
after
it
carried
out
a
detailed
analysis
that
focused
on
the
financial
needs
associated
with
the
event
it
was
decided
that
the
cost
would
be
too
much
for
the
country
to
bear
brazil
which
has
percent
of
the
amazon
rainforest
within
its
borders
a
biome
scientists
consider
one
of
nature
s
best
defenses
against
global
warming
as
it
acts
as
a
giant
carbon
sink
has
made
significant
strides
in
the
past
years
to
curtail
destruction
of
the
jungle
however
brazil
s
government
reported
last
week
that
annual
deforestation
levels
had
hit
their
highest
level
in
a
decade
critics
said
the
decision
to
not
host
the
climate
conference
was
related
to
the
election
in
late
october
of
jair
bolsonaro
who
will
take
office
on
the
reversal
to
host
the
meeting
is
likely
because
of
the
opposition
of
the
incoming
government
which
has
already
declared
war
on
sustainable
development
on
multiple
occasions
the
environmental
group
observatorio
da
clima
said
in
a
release
on
its
website
it
s
not
the
first
and
will
not
be
the
last
awful
news
from
jair
bolsonaro
on
this
aides
to
bolsonaro
did
not
immediately
reply
to
requests
for
comment
bolsonaro
has
antagonized
environmentalists
by
threatening
to
pull
brazil
out
of
the
paris
climate
accord
although
he
also
said
late
in
october
that
he
was
not
set
on
such
a
move
if
elected
bolsonaro
who
has
called
conservation
efforts
a
threat
to
brazilian
sovereignty
had
also
sought
to
combine
the
environmental
and
agricultural
ministries
but
later
retreated
from
that
proposal
as
well
