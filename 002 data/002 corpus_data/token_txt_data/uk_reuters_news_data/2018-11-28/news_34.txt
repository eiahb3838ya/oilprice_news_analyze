insurance
absli
plans
to
increase
its
holdings
in
oil
marketing
companies
as
crude
prices
come
under
pressure
and
valuations
in
the
sector
turn
attractive
ahead
of
general
elections
next
year
i
think
over
the
last
five
years
we
ve
seen
a
huge
of
these
stocks
and
a
very
sharp
correction
as
we
approach
the
elections
deven
sangoi
chief
investment
officer
for
equities
at
absli
the
life
insurance
arm
of
aditya
birla
capital
told
reuters
the
s
p
bse
oil
and
gas
index
has
lost
more
than
percent
of
its
value
since
it
touched
a
record
high
of
in
november
last
year
oil
prices
have
slumped
by
more
than
percent
since
early
october
pressured
by
concerns
supply
will
exceed
demand
in
as
economic
growth
slows
with
inventories
rising
it
slipped
to
below
a
barrel
on
wednesday
sangoi
said
he
expected
oil
prices
to
remain
between
a
barrel
oil
might
even
drop
to
a
barrel
if
there
is
a
demand
shock
due
to
a
global
growth
slump
he
added
potentially
giving
a
boost
to
oil
marketing
companies
margins
if
this
oil
call
goes
right
then
i
think
oil
marketing
companies
are
a
value
said
sangoi
who
manages
about
billion
rupees
billion
in
equities
out
of
absli
s
billion
rupees
of
assets
under
management
indian
oil
corp
hindustan
petroleum
corp
and
bharat
petroleum
corp
are
among
the
top
oil
marketing
companies
in
india
sangoi
s
bet
also
hinges
on
the
outcome
of
national
elections
due
by
may
he
said
the
current
government
had
let
oil
marketing
companies
maintain
their
margins
during
a
period
of
rising
crude
prices
by
passing
the
cost
to
consumers
opinion
polls
show
prime
minister
narendra
modi
remains
the
front
runner
to
win
another
term
but
his
bharatiya
janata
party
has
suffered
reverses
in
recent
local
elections
that
have
energised
the
opposition
markets
are
looking
now
for
cues
from
five
key
state
elections
in
the
next
few
weeks
if
the
modi
government
comes
back
then
this
sector
will
just
go
through
the
roof
sangoi
said
he
is
also
betting
on
power
generating
companies
next
year
as
a
pick
up
in
economic
growth
boosts
demand
for
energy
i
m
a
very
firm
believer
that
there
is
going
to
be
very
high
growth
in
energy
consumption
if
we
continue
to
grow
at
percent
sangoi
said
an
increase
in
tariffs
by
the
regulator
and
better
capacity
utilisation
at
power
plants
should
also
help
these
firms
he
said
elsewhere
sangoi
said
he
expected
private
sector
banks
especially
those
with
corporate
clients
to
benefit
next
year
as
financial
firms
suffer
from
an
ongoing
credit
crisis
and
bad
loans
which
have
plagued
lenders
continue
to
dwindle
