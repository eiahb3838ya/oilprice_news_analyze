adding
to
worries
about
a
worldwide
supply
glut

in

crude
stocks
have
risen
percent
with
straight
weeks
of
increases
the
steady
build
in
crude
stocks
is
partly
due
to
seasonal
refining
maintenance
but
domestic
production
also
has
surged
to
a
record
million
barrels
per
day
it
s
hard
to
get
more
bearish
after
this
report

out
more

of
our

last
two
months

losses
after
a
speech
from
federal

chair
jerome
powell
who
said
risks
to
the
economy
are
relatively
balanced
suggesting
the
pace
of
hikes
may
slow
in
coming
months
that
bolstered
the
stock
market
but

didn
t
last

tried
to
latch
onto
the

market
excitement
but
at
the
end
of
the

the
selling
pressure

in
what
that

is
that
there
are
many
people
who
are
still
bearish
on
oil

investors
have
sold

decision
to
grant
