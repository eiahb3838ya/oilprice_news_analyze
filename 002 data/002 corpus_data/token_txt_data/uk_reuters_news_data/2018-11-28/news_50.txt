asian
markets
had
slipped
on
tuesday
after
president
donald
trump
said
in
an
interview
with
the
wall
street
journal
it
was
highly
unlikely
he
would
accept
china
s
request
to
hold
off
a
planned
increase
in
tariffs
however
white
house
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
sought
to
brighten
the
mood
by
confirming
a
dinner
powwow
between
trump
and
his
chinese
counterpart
xi
jinping
at
an
upcoming
gathering
in
argentina
he
also
held
open
the
possibility
that
the
two
countries
would
reach
a
trade
deal
the
news
boosted
wall
street
s
main
indexes
which
finished
in
positive
territory
after
spending
much
of
the
session
in
the
red
however
it
was
still
unclear
whether
the
two
sides
had
agreed
on
a
formal
agenda
for
the
leaders
meeting
after
the
summit
and
kudlow
said
there
were
no
scheduled
talks
on
the
ground
for
their
advisers
at
the
same
time
a
german
magazine
reported
citing
eu
sources
that
trump
could
impose
tariffs
on
imported

lower
the
market
mood
has
turned
cautious
once
again
amid
a
flurry
of
trade
headlines
pointing
to
the
prospect
of
a
new
round
of
trade
tariffs
ahead
said
rodrigo
catril
senior
strategist
at
national
australia
bank
the
market
seems
to
be
jumping
at
shadows
at
the
moment
and
against
this
backdrop
of
uncertainty
the
usd
remains
the
preferred
option
for
weathering
the
the
dollar
index
which
measures
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
jumped
overnight
to
to
edge
towards
a
year
top
of
set
earlier
this
month
investors
will
now
turn
their
attention
to
a
speech
on
wednesday
by
federal
reserve
chair
jerome
powell
for
further
clues
on
how
many
more
times
the
central
bank
is
likely
to
raise
interest
rates
the
event
has
become
even
more
critical
as
signs
of
a
global
slowdown
and
nearly
two
months
of
market
volatility
have
clouded
an
otherwise
rosy
picture
prompting
speculations
the
fed
will
go
slow
on
rate
hikes
next
year
traders
are
also
watching
the
speech
in
light
of
trump
s
criticism
of
powell
in
a
newspaper
interview
saying
rising
interest
rates
and
other
fed
policies
were
damaging
the
economy
elsewhere
in
the
foreign
exchange
market
the
pound
was
among
the
worst
performing
major
currencies

british
prime
minister
theresa
may
will
take
her
brexit

pitch
to
scotland
on
wednesday
where
she
will
likely
face
an
uphill
struggle
to
convince
sceptical
voters
of
the
benefits
of
her
deal
for
businesses
may
needs
to
win
a
vote
in
parliament
on
to
approve
her
deal
but
that
looks
difficult
with
an
apparent
large
majority
of
lawmakers

the
scottish
