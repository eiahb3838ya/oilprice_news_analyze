asian
refining
margins
for
gasoil
slid
to
their
lowest
in
four
months
on
wednesday
squeezed
as
traders
brace
for
a
flood
of
extra
chinese
fuel
hitting
a
region
already
awash
in
supplies
at
a
time
of
unexpectedly
lacklustre
demand
refining
margins
known
as
cracks
for
gasoil
with
parts
per
million
ppm
sulphur
content
fell
to
a
barrel
over
dubai
crude
on
wednesday
their
weakest
since
the
drop
comes
as
the
chinese
government
gets
set
to
release
million
tonnes
of
additional
fuel
export
quotas
this
year
taking
total
quotas
to
about
million
tonnes
this
fuel
mostly
gasoline
and
diesel
follows
the
release
of
million
tonnes
of
additional
fuel
a
month
ago
china
s
diesel
exports
in
october
jumped
to
million
tonnes
up
percent
from
million
tonnes
the
previous
month
according
to
customs
data
adding
to
an
already
well
supplied
market
several
southeast
asian
refineries
came
back
on
line
in
recent
weeks
after
maintenance
shutdowns
worse
demand
has
been
modest
the
refineries
are
exporting
a
lot
of
gasoil
but
can
not
find
a
home
for
each
cargo
said
one
middle
distillate
trader
declining
to
be
named
as
that
was
against
company
policy
normally
during
winter
we
see
a
dramatic
increase
in
gasoil
demand
but
this
year
we
haven
t
found
out
any
such
pattern
yet
she
added
a
mild
start
to
north
asia
s
winter
has
resulted
in
relatively
low
demand
for
heating
fuels
including
oil
and
gas
the
benchmark
gasoil
margins
have
shed
more
than
percent
in
the
last
two
weeks
since
hitting
a
peak
of
a
barrel
on
still
they
re
at
their
strongest
levels
for
this
time
of
the
year
since
the
slump
may
not
last
as
arbitrage
opportunities
from
asia
to
europe
will
likely
offer
support
to
singapore
s
gasoil
cracks
traders
said
despite
the
recent
fall
singapore
s
gasoil
premium
over
northwest
europe
was
around
per
tonne
on
wednesday
refinitiv
eikon
data
showed
the
arbitrage
is
usually
profitable
from
a
spread
of
around
a
tonne
at
current
clean
tanker
rates
the
spread
should
be
over
per
tonne
according
to
reuters
calculations
based
on
refinitiv
data
continued
shortage
in
the
west
will
provide
a
floor
from
which
the
regional
asian
crack
can
rebound
a
trade
source
said
europe
is
currently
undersupplied
with
gasoil
with
inventories
held
in
the
hub
down
by
over
percent
in
the
last
months
