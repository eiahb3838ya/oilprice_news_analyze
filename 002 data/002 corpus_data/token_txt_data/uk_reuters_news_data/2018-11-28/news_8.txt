easing
investor
worries
about
the
pace
of
interest
rate
hikes
next
year
hopes
that
the
united
states
and
china
could
call
a
trade
war
ceasefire
at
the
upcoming
summit
also
helped
stocks
meanwhile
the
dollar
retreated
with
potentially
fewer
rate
increases
on
the
horizon
and
sterling
rose
after
the
bank
of
england
said
the
economy
could
shrink
by
as
much
as
percent
in
about
a
year
after
a
brexit
equity
investors
reacted
favourably
to
the
comments
by
powell
who
indicated
there
may
not
be
as
many
future
interest
rate
hikes
from
the
central
bank
as
was
initially
anticipated
he
gave
the
market
and
presumably
president
trump
exactly
what
he
wanted
which
was
an
admission
that
the
previously
proposed
path
of
future
rate
hikes
was
probably
too
aggressive
said

pursche
chief

management
in
new

president
donald
trump
has
recently
been
critical
of

earlier
hopes
for
a
truce
on
trade
had
also
helped
lift
equities
despite
trump
s
tough
remarks
on
the
trade
dispute
ahead
of
saturday
s
meeting
with
chinese
president
xi
jinping
markets
focused
on
comments
by
white
house
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
who
indicated
the
two
countries
could
call
a
truce
if
they
come
out
with
nothing
this
weekend
it
s
going
to
be
very
bad
said
bernd
berg
global
macro
strategist
at
woodman
asset
management
still
lingering
caution
that
the
two
sides
would
leave
the
summit
without
an
agreement
capped
gains
in
europe
where
auto
stocks
were
under
pressure
after
a
report
trump
may
soon
impose
new
import
tariffs
a
rapprochement
between
the
united
states
and
china
is
seen
as
crucial
given
that
world
growth
and
trade
are
already
showing
signs
of
an
alarming
slowdown
uncertainty
over
global
trade
as
well
as
brexit
and
italy
s
conflict
with
the
european
union
had
supported
the
dollar
but
the
dollar
index
dipped
percent
after
powell
s
comments
the
euro
was
up
percent
to
sterling
meanwhile
gained
percent
after
the
bank
of
england
warned
about
the
economic
risks
from
exiting
the
european
union
without
a
deal
it
said
britain
risks
suffering
an
even
bigger
hit
to
its
economy
than
during
the
global
financial
crisis
years
ago
if
it
leaves
the
european
union
in
a
brexit
scenario
our
jobs
is
not
to
hope
for
the
best

to
prepare

worst
boe
governor
mark
carney
said
some
market
participants
took
the
remarks
as
a
good
sign
i
think
he
s
assuaging
fears
saying
that
