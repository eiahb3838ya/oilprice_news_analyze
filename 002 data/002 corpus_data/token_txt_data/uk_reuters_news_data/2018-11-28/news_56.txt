is
emblematic
of
china
s
strengthening
of
economic
diplomatic
and
cultural
ties
with
argentina
it
is
part
of
a
wider
push
by
beijing
into
latin
america
that

alarmed
the
united

which
views
the

as

his
chinese
counterpart
xi
jinping
on
the

on
their

but
the
backdrop
will
be
the
competition
between

with
the

its
troubled
economy
earlier
this
year
trump
voiced
his
support
for
the
plan
and
president
mauricio
macri
s
leadership
but
it
is
china
that
has
emerged
as
argentina
s
critical
trading
partner
investor
and
financier
a
reuters

of
trade
and
investment
data
shows
with
beijing
pumping
billions
into
argentina
s
economy
and
positioning
itself
as
a
reliable
lender
for
its
economy
china
and
argentina
are
expected
to
seal
a
currency
swap
deal
this
weekend
that
doubles
the
original
amount
of
the
credit
line
to
billion
the
deal
will
make
china
the
biggest
lender
to
argentina
china
is
the
main
importer
of
argentine
soybeans
the
south
american
country
s
biggest
cash
crop
in
the
last
years
it
has
also
emerged
as
a
major
financier
of
argentine
projects
mainly
infrastructure
worth
a
total
of
about
billion
offering
low
interest
rates
of
between
and
percent
according
to
a
reuters
review
of
chinese
state
funding
data
compiled
by
the
dialogue
a
the
negotiations
on
chinese
financing
of
the
atucha
iii
nuclear
power
plant
are
a
key
cause
for
concern
for
the
government
a
senior
trump
administration
official
told
reuters
atucha
iii
would
be
one
of
the
biggest
projects
financed
by
china
in
argentina
according
to
the
reuters
review
of
chinese
state
funding
data
argentina
s
national
newspaper
clarin
reported
at
the
weekend
that
if
the
deal
was
signed
china
would
loan
argentina
billion
to
be
repaid
in
years
with
eight
years
of
grace
and
a
percent
annual
interest
reuters
was
not
able
to
independently
confirm
these
details
these
are
infrastructure
projects
where
china
is
coming
in
and
providing
very
low
interest
loans
or
they
are
just
having
chinese
companies
do
it
the
official
said
it
s
creating
an
economic
and
political
dependency
on
china
that
s
incredibly
the
message
to
macri
and
other
regional
leaders
is
increasingly
that
your
sovereignty
can
be
lost
by
being
so
ensnared
in
debt
you
can
lose
your
sovereignty
to
the
person
who
holds
your
debt
the
official
said
china
s
foreign
ministry
strongly
disputes
that
view
china
s
investment
and
financing
in
latin
america
are
in
line
with
market
rules
and
common
international
rules
and
practices
and
do
not
have
any
political
conditions
attached
the
ministry
said
in
a
statement
to
reuters
the
involvement
of
chinese
companies
in
water
power
and
road
projects
has
helped
to
drive
argentine
economic
and
social
development
it
said
defending
argentina
s
relationship
with
china
an
argentine
government
official
told
reuters
that
beijing
was
an
important
investor
and
would
only
become
more
important
in
the
future
however
the
official
acknowledged
the
concerns
were
not
without
merit
overall
i
would
say
it
s
a
fair
warning
and
it
s
something
countries
should
take
into
consideration
i
think
argentina
takes
it
into
consideration
very
seriously
the
official
said
china
s
attraction
to
argentina
can
be
attributed
to
three
factors
natural
resources
weak
institutions
and
the
country
s
lack
of
other
financing
options
according
to
juan
uriburu
an
argentine
lawyer
who
has
worked
on
two
major
joint
ventures
china
can
afford
to
have
these
competitive
interest
rates
in
the
meantime
what
they
create
are
new
markets
for
chinese
companies
abroad
which
back
home
means
chinese
companies
will
be
working
making
the
products
making
the
locomotives
the
cars
the
rails
everything
uriburu
said
tripodi
the
argentine
investment
agency
head
credited
macri
s
more
policies
for
the
uptick
in
chinese
investment
interest
from
chinese
companies
was
growing
in
an
exponential
way
he
said
as
a
presidential
candidate
macri
pledged
to
recalibrate
argentina
s
relationship
with
china
under
his
predecessor
cristina
fernandez
argentina
had
changed
the
law
to
enable
chinese
companies
to
skip
the
bidding
process
if
they
were
financing
projects
according
to
margaret
myers
director
of
the
china
and
latin
american
programme
at
dialogue
when
macri
took
office
in
late
he
vowed
to
review
deals
the
fernandez
government
had
made
with
china
atucha
iii
a
railway
project
and
two
hydropower
dams
in
santa
cruz
province
which
her
late
husband
had
governed
were
among
projects
thrown
into
limbo
clauses
however
have
made
it
difficult
for
macri
to
terminate
the
largest
projects
said
uriburu
macri
has
instead
renegotiated
some
terms
including
bringing
down
the
loan
amount
for
the
hydro
dams
from
billion
to
billion
in
brazil
latin
america
s
biggest
economy
jair
bolsonaro
also
took
a
tough
stance
against
china
on
the
campaign
trail
portraying
it
as
a
predator
seeking
to
dominate
key
business
sectors
but
since
winning
election
bolsonaro
has
softened
his
position
saying
china
is
welcome
to
invest
in
brazil
and
that
trade
between
the
two
countries
could
grow
china
s
influence
in
argentina
extends
beyond
the
numbers
for
example
it
has
established
confucius
institutes
cultural
organizations
at
argentina
s
largest
university
the
university
of
buenos
aires
and
a
second
college
in
buenos
aires
province
some
lawmakers
have
warned
that
the
institutes
which
number
more
than
around
the
world
are
an
attempt
by
china
to
further
its
political
influence
which
beijing
denies
in
one
of
the
most
visible
examples
of
chinese
soft
power
in
argentina
the
government
held
a
nationally
televised
event
with
the
chinese
ambassador
earlier
this
month
to
showcase
armoured
vehicles
and
other
security
equipment
that
china
has
donated
to
help
secure
the
event
argentine
security
officials
told
reuters
they
would
hold
a
separate
event
to
highlight
aid
for
the
summit
which
begins
on
friday
that
has
yet
to
happen
