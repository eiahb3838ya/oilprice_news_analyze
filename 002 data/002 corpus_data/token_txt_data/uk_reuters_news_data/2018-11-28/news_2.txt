saudi
arabia
is
set
to
expand
its
market
share
in
china
this
year
for
the
first
time
since
with
demand
stirred
up
by
new
chinese
refiners
pushing
the
kingdom
back
into
contention
with
russia
as
top
supplier
to
the
world
s
largest
oil
buyer
saudi
arabia
the
biggest
global
oil
exporter
has
been
surpassed
by
russia
as
top
crude
supplier
to
china
the
past
two
years
as
private
teapot
refiners
and
a
new
pipeline
drove
up
demand
for
russian
oil
now
fresh
demand
from
new
refineries
starting
up
in
could
increase
china
s
saudi
oil
imports
by
between
barrels
per
day
bpd
and
bpd
nudging
the
opec
kingpin
back
towards
the
top
analysts
say
saudi
aramco
said
last
week
it
will
sign
five
crude
supply
agreements
that
will
take
its
contract
totals
with
chinese
buyers
to
million
bpd
with
the
recent
crude
oil
supply
agreements
and
potential
increase
of
refinery
capacity
the
saudis
could
overtake
the
russians
and
reclaim
the
crown
as
the
biggest
crude
exporter
to
china
rystad
energy
analyst
paola
said
saudi
arabia
has
already
gained
ground
this
year
china
imported
million
bpd
of
saudi
crude
in
the
first
months
of
china
customs
data
showed
this
is
equivalent
to
percent
of
total
chinese
imports
up
from
percent
in
reuters
calculations
showed
saudi
s
market
share
in
china
could
jump
to
nearly
percent
next
year
if
buyers
requested
full
contractual
volumes
analysts
from
rystad
energy
and
refinitiv
said
while
growth
in
russian
oil
supply
to
china
could
slow
china
imported
million
bpd
of
russian
crude
in
this
year
about
percent
of
total
chinese
imports
customs
data
showed
russia
had
a
percent
share
at
million
bpd
in
we
expect
chinese
imports
of
russian
crude
to
remain
at
a
similar
rate
in
as
a
large
share
of
these
russian
barrels
are
imported
via
pipeline
refinitiv
analyst
mark
tay
said
the
biggest
boost
to
saudi
exports
to
china
comes
from
contracts
inked
with
new
refineries
starting
up
this
year
and
next
owned
by
companies
other
than
state
oil
giants
sinopec
or
petrochina
the
contracts
include
bpd
to
dalian
hengli
petrochemical
and
up
to
bpd
to
zhejiang
petrochemical
corp
each
of
which
has
a
refinery
saudi
aramco
has
also
agreed
to
increase
sinochem
corp
s
supplies
which
will
be
processed
at
its
quanzhou
and
hongrun
refineries
sinopec
petrochina
and
china
national
offshore
oil
corp
have
all
kept
their
term
saudi
volumes
for
next
year
unchanged
consultancy
sia
energy
expects
saudi
crude
imports
to
rise
by
just
bpd
in
raising
its
market
share
to
percent
but
leaving
it
behind
russia
we
expect
lower
saudi
crude
demand
from
hengli
and
rongsheng
as
it
is
unlikely
for
them
to
run
their
refineries
at
full
rate
in
analyst
seng
yick
tee
said
zhejiang
petrochemical
is
by
rongsheng
holdings
still
a
source
familiar
with
aramco
s
export
plans
said
there
is
tremendous
appetite
from
china
s
independents
and
that
it
needed
to
be
more
aggressive
in
its
marketing
strategy
the
state
oil
company
did
move
more
swiftly
to
seal
the
most
recent
deals
than
it
used
to
in
the
past
industry
sources
said
aramco
s
first
deal
with
hengli
was
to
supply
million
barrels
of
crude
about
bpd
in
said
a
senior
source
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
deal
hengli
executed
the
deal
nicely
which
helped
build
trust
he
said
hengli
is
designed
to
process
percent
saudi
crude
a
mix
of
arab
medium
and
arab
heavy
while
the
remaining
percent
is
brazilian
marlim
crude
rongsheng
s
plant
is
identical
to
hengli
the
industry
sources
said
the
sources
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
aramco
is
also
supplying
petrochina
s
refinery
in
china
s
southwestern
yunnan
province
with
about
million
barrels
a
month
of
crude
via
a
pipeline
from
myanmar
between
july
and
november
eikon
data
showed
although
sources
said
talks
for
saudi
arabia
to
acquire
a
stake
in
the
refinery
have
stalled
saudi
aramco
s
chief
executive
amin
nasser
said
on
monday
the
company
will
push
to
expand
its
market
share
in
china
and
is
still
looking
for
new
refining
deals
there
despite
opec
s
likely
limits
on
output
next
year
saudi
aramco
will
supply
up
to
percent
of
the
oil
required
at
its
joint
venture
refinery
in
malaysia
with
petronas
between
china
and
malaysia
alone
saudi
arabia
will
have
to
increase
exports
to
asia
by
more
than
bpd
next
year
this
comes
as
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
is
discussing
production
cuts
of
as
much
as
million
bpd
for
next
year
to
prop
up
oil
prices
between
balancing
global
supplies
and
increasing
market
in
asia
aramco
may
decide
to
forgo
market
share
in
other
markets
like
the
united
states
where
the
surge
in
domestic
production
will
make
it
difficult
for
the
saudis
to
retain
market
share
anyway
rystad
s
said
saudi
s
oil
shipments
to
the
united
states
have
risen
recently
to
above
mln
bpd
but
output
is
also
increasing
said
the
source
familiar
with
saudi
aramco
s
export
plans
you
need
to
lessen
the
inventories
in
the
the
source
said
adding
that
aramco
will
likely
divert
oil
supply
from
the
united
states
to
asia
to
meet
rising
demand
there
a
chinese
oil
executive
said
china
is
where
the
demand
growth
is
the
saudis
are
very
wise
to
capture
