here
in
brazil
bolsonaro
said
the
next
foreign
minister
ernesto
ara√∫jo
has
said
climate
change
was
part
of
a
plot
against
western
economic
growth
bolsonaro
has
threatened
to
follow
the
lead
of
president
donald
trump
and
yank
brazil
out
of
the
paris
climate
agreement
which
was
the
reason
along
with
high
cost
bolsonaro
gave
for
not
wanting
to
host
the
november
conference
the
triple
a
is
at
play
in
that
accord
bolsonaro
said
what
is
the
triple
a
it
s
a
big
strip
between
the
andes
amazon
and
atlantic
that
could
result
in
our
losing
sovereignty
over
the
area
the
idea
is
to
turn
it
into
a
ecological
last
month
the
foreign
ministry
announced
brazil
s
offer
to
host
the
event
in
a
press
release
saying
the
meeting
would
work
out
final
details
of
the
paris
agreement
and
for
signatory
countries
to
fully
implement
its
demands
by
hosting
the
event
would
have
confirmed
brazil
s
role
as
a
world
leader
on
sustainable
development
issues
especially
in
relation
to
climate
brazil
which
has
percent
of
the
amazon
rainforest
within
its
borders
a
biome
scientists
consider
one
of
nature
s
best
defenses
against
global
warming
as
it
acts
as
a
giant
carbon
sink
has
made
significant
strides
in
the
past
years
to
curtail
destruction
of
the
jungle
however
brazil
s
government
reported
last
week
that
annual
deforestation
levels
had
hit
their
highest
level
in
a
decade
the
environmental
group
observatorio
da
clima
said
on
its
website
that
the
decision
to
withdraw
its
offer
to
host
the
event
is
not
the
first
and
will
not
be
the
last
awful
news
from
jair
bolsonaro
on
this
bolsonaro
had
also
sought
to
combine
the
environmental
and
agricultural
ministries
but
later
retreated
from
that
proposal
