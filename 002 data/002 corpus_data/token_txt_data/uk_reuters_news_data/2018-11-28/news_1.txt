rising
heat
and
wilder
weather
linked
to
climate
change
make
it
the
biggest
global
health
threat
of
the
century
with
hundreds
of
millions
more
people
already
suffering
in
the
last
two
decades
medical
officials
warned
wednesday
in
a
report
published
by
the
lancet
medical
journal
scientists
and
health
experts
said
climate
change
impacts
from
heatwaves
to
worsening
storms
floods
and
fires
were
surging
and
threatened
to
overwhelm
health
systems
that
s
the
thing
that
really
keeps
me
up
at
night
said
nick
watts
executive
director
of
the
lancet
countdown
an
annual
report
tracking
connections
between
public
health
and
climate
change
storms
and
floods
for
instance
do
not
only
cause
direct
injuries
but
can
also
shut
down
hospitals
spur
disease
outbreaks
and
produce
lingering
mental
health
problems
as
people
lose
their
homes
he
said
wildfires
similarly
hurt
and
uproot
people
but
also
dramatically
worsen
air
pollution
in
broad
areas
california
s
recent
wildfires
spurred
by
drought
have
cost
more
than
lives
but
have
also
polluted
air
as
far
east
as
massachusetts
said
gina
mccarthy
a
former
head
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
now
at
harvard
university
s
public
health
school
kristie
ebi
a
professor
of
global
health
at
the
university
of
washington
said
multiple
climate
health
impacts
were
often
hitting
at
once
we
see
them
coming
at
communities
all
at
the
same
time
she
said
the
lancet
report
produced
by
doctors
academics
and
policy
experts
from
organisations
around
the
world
called
for
fast
action
to
curb
climate
change
and
prepare
global
health
systems
for
growing
challenges
a
rapidly
changing
climate
has
dire
implications
for
every
aspect
of
human
life
exposing
vulnerable
populations
to
extremes
of
weather
altering
patterns
of
infectious
disease
and
compromising
food
security
safe
drinking
water
and
clean
air
it
warned
already
million
more
people
worldwide
were
exposed
to
heatwaves
last
year
than
in
according
to
the
report
hotter
weather
led
to
the
loss
of
billion
hours
of
labour
in
a
percent
jump
from
as
workers
in
construction
farming
and
other
industries
downed
tools
often
squeezing
family
income
in
india
heat
caused
the
number
of
hours
worked
to
fall
by
almost
percent
in
watts
said
richer
countries
also
are
seeing
the
effects
of
heat
the
report
noted
europe
and
the
eastern
mediterranean
for
instance
appear
more
vulnerable
than
africa
and
southeast
asia
it
said
that
is
largely
because
so
many
older
people
who
are
particularly
at
risk
live
in
cities
which
trap
heat
and
can
be
hotter
than
surrounding
areas
the
report
said
england
and
wales
for
instance
saw
more
deaths
than
normal
during
a
hot
spell
in
june
and
july
this
year
watts
said
renee
salas
an
emergency
room
doctor
at
massachusetts
general
hospital
in
the
united
states
and
an
author
of
the
report
said
she
recently
treated
a
man
felled
by
heatstroke
while
trying
to
work
two
construction
jobs
keep
in
mind
that
for
every
statistic
there
is
a
personal
story
she
urged
such
medical
cases
are
the
often
hidden
human
cost
of
climate
change
she
added
warmer
conditions
linked
to
climate
change
are
enlarging
the
potential
range
of
diseases
such
as
dengue
fever
as
well
as
other
health
threats
the
report
said
since
the
baltic
region
has
seen
a
increase
in
coastal
areas
suitable
for
cholera
outbreaks
while
in
africa
s
highlands
zones
where
mosquitoes
can
survive
have
expanded
by
percent
hotter
conditions
may
also
be
giving
some
microbes
greater
resistance
to
antibiotics
salas
said
and
higher
temperatures
seem
to
be
curbing
the
maximum
harvest
from
farmland
in
all
regions
of
the
world
reversing
an
earlier
trend
toward
harvests
the
report
noted
ebi
of
the
university
of
washington
said
rising
carbon
dioxide
levels
in
the
atmosphere
are
shrinking
nutrients
in
cereal
crops
hiking
the
risk
of
malnutrition
even
for
those
who
get
enough
to
eat
mental
health
threats
meanwhile
from
children
worried
about
their
future
in
an
overheating
world
to
families
stressed
by
disaster
losses
are
on
the
rise
she
said
acting
swiftly
to
curb
climate
change
whether
by
switching
to
clean
energy
or
getting
more
people
to
walk
and
use
bicycles
would
lower
healthcare
costs
by
the
same
amount
of
money
needed
to
reduce
emissions
ebi
said
most
mitigation
policies
are
good
for
health
and
they
good
for
health
now
