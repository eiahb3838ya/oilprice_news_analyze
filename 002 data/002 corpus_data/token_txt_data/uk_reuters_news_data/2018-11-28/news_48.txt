lp
and
its
sunoco
pipeline
subsidiary
have
racked
up
more
than
state
and
federal
permit
violations
while
racing
to
build
two
of
the
nation
s
largest
natural
gas
pipelines
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of
government
data
and
regulatory
records
the
pipelines
known
as
energy
transfer
rover
and
sunoco
mariner
east
will
carry
natural
gas
and
gas
liquids
from
pennsylvania
ohio
and
west
virginia
an
area
that
now
accounts
for
more
than
a
third
of
gas
production
reuters
analyzed
four
comparable
pipeline
projects
and
found
they
averaged
violations
each
during
construction
the
rover
and
mariner
violations
included
spills
of
drilling
fluid
a
mixture
that
lubricates
equipment
for
drilling
under
rivers
and
highways
sinkholes
in
backyards
and
improper
disposal
of
hazardous

and
other
trash
fines
topped

energy

also
raised
the
ire
of
federal
regulators
by
tearing
down
a
historic
house
along
rover
s
route
the
appalachia
region
has
become
a
hub
for
natural
gas
as
it
increasingly
replaces
coal
for
power
generation
creating
an
urgent
need
for
new
pipelines
but
the
recent
experience
of
residents
and
regulators
with
the
two
energy
transfer
pipelines
has
state
officials
vowing
to
tighten
laws
and
scrutinize
future
projects
ohio
s
negative
experience
with
rover
has
fundamentally
changed
how
we
will
permit
pipeline
projects
said
james
lee
a
spokesman
for
the
ohio
environmental
protection
agency
problems
with
mariner
prompted
pennsylvania
legislators
to
craft
bills
tightening
construction
regulations
which
have
drawn
bipartisan
support
any
pipeline
going
through
this
area
is
going
to
face
resistance
which
it
would
not
have
faced
before
said
pennsylvania
state
senator
andy
dinniman
a
democrat
energy
transfer
spokeswoman
alexis
daniel
said
the
firm
remained
committed
to
safe
construction
and
operation
and
at
times
went
above
and
beyond
regulations
for
the
two
projects
construction
of
the
billion
rover
started
in
march
and
was
planned
to
proceed
at
about
miles
a
month
while
work
on
the
billion
mariner
east
started
in
february
and
was
planned
at
miles
a
month
according
to
company
statements
on
construction
schedules
both
were
targeted
for
completion
late
last
year
regulators
and
industry
experts
said
the
pace
of
both
projects
far
exceeded
industry
norms
the
four
other
projects
examined
by
reuters
were
mostly
completed
at
a
pace
averaging
miles
per
month
reuters
selected
the
projects
for
comparison
because
like
rover
and
mariner
they
cost
more
than
billion
stretched
at
least
miles
and
were
under
construction
at
the
same
time
construction
on
both
energy
transfer
pipelines
was
ultimately
slowed
when
state
and
federal
regulators
ordered
numerous
work
stoppages
after
permit
violations
energy
transfer
completed
the
last
two
sections
of
rover
in
november
and
said
it
expects
to
put
mariner
east
in
service
soon
in
february
pennsylvania
fined
the
company
million
for
environmental
damage
including
the
discharge
of
drilling
fluids
into
state
waters
without
a
permit
after
further
problems
including
the
sinkholes
a
state
judge
in
may
ordered
work
halted
on
mariner
east
administrative
law
judge
elizabeth
barnes
wrote
that
energy
transfer
s
sunoco
unit
made
deliberate
managerial
decisions
to
proceed
in
what
appears
to
be
a
rushed
manner
in
an
apparent
prioritization
of
profit
over
the
best
while
pipeline
construction
schedules
vary
the
planned
timelines
for
rover
and
mariner
were
ambitious

and
a

the

were
appropriate

the

the
number
of

slower

finished
mostly
on

the

really

she
said
you

out

she
said
the
rover
pipeline
attracted
additional
federal
scrutiny
when
energy

demolished
a
historic
house
along
its
route
after
energy

bought
the

ferc
staff
in

required
the

to
come
up
with
a
plan
to
prevent
adverse
effects
on

according
to
a
staff

environmental
report
instead
the
company
tore
down
the
house
in
may
without
notifying
ferc
or
the
ohio
state
historic
preservation
office
that
led
ferc
to
deny
energy

a
blanket
certificate
that
would
have
allowed

construct

with
less
oversight
noting
the
demolition
convinced
regulators
the
company
can
not
be
trusted
to
comply
with
environmental
regulations
energy
transfer
did
not
comment
on
the
denial
but
said
in
a
statement
that
it
had
resolved
all
outstanding
issues
with
the
demolition
and
donated
more
than
million
to
the
ohio

and
west

regulators
required
the
company
to
halt
work
on
parts
of
the

after
violations
including
the
release
of
an
estimated
million
gallons
of
drilling
fluid
into
wetlands
near
the
tuscarawas
river
in
ohio
in
april
for
a

mariner

received
more
than
notices
of
violation
from
the

department
of

for
accidental

a

seeking
about

some
of

the
alleged
illegal

dillinger

the

was
disappointed
that
the

sued

amicably

that
it
would
continue
cooperating

continue
to
work
closely
