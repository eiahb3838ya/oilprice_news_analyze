south
african
power
firm
eskom
said
on
wednesday
that
asset
sales
could
not
solve
its
problems
and
that
a
bailout
or
debt
relief
were
preferable
as
it
flagged
a
loss
before
tax
of
more
than
billion
rand
million
this
financial
year
eskom
africa
s
largest
public
utility
is
working
on
a
turnaround
plan
to
reverse
a
decade
of
steep
decline
in
which
electricity
sales
fell
while
debt
ballooned
and
the
company
became
embroiled
in
corruption
scandals
it
supplies
more
than
percent
of
south
africa
s
power
making
it
critical
to
the
health
of
the
billion
economy
eskom
is
in
a
state
of
severe
financial
difficulty
we
are
locked
into
a
position
eskom
chairman
jabu
mabuza
told
a
news
conference
all
the
assets
which
we
could
sell
are
the
ones
that
no
one
could
buy
mabuza
said
there
are
other
ways
call
them
what
you
want
a
bailout
an
equity
injection
by
the
shareholder
or
some
debt
president
cyril
ramaphosa
appointed
a
new
board
at
eskom
early
this
year
in
one
of
his
first
moves
since
replacing
jacob
zuma
as
leader
of
the
ruling
african
national
congress
but
efforts
to
turn
the
company
around
have
been
hampered
by
severe
fiscal
constraints
labour
unrest
and
fuel
shortages
affecting
as
much
as
of
its
power
stations
on
wednesday
eskom
reported
a
million
rand
profit
in
the
six
months
to
the
end
of
september
but
said
its
performance
in
the
next
six
months
would
be
hurt
by
a
wage
deal
with
trade
unions
and
greater
maintenance
costs
that
compares
with
a
billion
rand
profit
in
the
six
months
to
the
end
of
september
and
a
loss
of
billion
rand
loss
for
the
financial
year
eskom
s
total
debt
rose
to
billion
rand
at
the
end
of
september
from
billion
a
year
earlier
its
cash
levels
rose
from
billion
rand
to
billion
rand
over
the
same
period
but
are
expected
to
come
under
pressure
in
the
second
half
of
the
financial
year
eskom
s
mabuza
ruled
out
swaps
as
a
way
to
reduce
indebtedness
saying
converting
debt
held
by
state
pension
fund
the
public
investment
corporation
was
a
dangerous
route
ceo
phakamani
hadebe
said
options
for
government
support
could
be
a
cash
injection
or
moving
some
of
its
debt
to
the
government
s
balance
sheet
our
debt
levels
have
reached
certain
levels
which
are
no
longer
sustainable
