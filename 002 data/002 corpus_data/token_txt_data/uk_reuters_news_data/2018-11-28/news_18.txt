exclusive-epa refinery biofuel waiver program on hold pending review -sources

york
nov
reuters
the
trump
administration
has
temporarily
frozen
a
program
meant
to
exempt
small
oil
refineries
in
financial
distress
from
the
biofuels
law
as
it
reviews
the
scoring
system
to
evaluate
applications
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
the
review
means
changes
are
likely
to
the
program
which
has
become
a
lightning
rod
of
controversy
between
the
rival
oil
and
corn
industries
since
the
environmental
protection
agency
vastly
increased
the
number
of
waivers
for
last
year
under
the
renewable
fuel
standard
oil
refiners
must
increasingly
blend
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
their
fuel
each
year
or
purchase
blending
credits
from
those
that
do
the
regulation
was
passed
in
to
help
farmers
and
cut
fuel
imports
but
small
oil
refineries
can
be
exempted
from
the
standard
if
they
prove
that
compliance
would
cause
disproportionate
hardship
the
epa
granted
such
waivers
for
the
compliance
year
up
from
in
and
in
the
biofuels
industry
and
lawmakers
representing
farm
states
have
argued
that
the
expansion
hurt
farmers
by
eroding
demand
for
ethanol
and
want
the
program
halted
but
refiners
consider
the
program
a
lifeline
to
small
facilities
and
have
won
lawsuits
accusing
the
epa
of
being
too
stingy
with
waivers
the
two
sources
who
requested
anonymity
to
discuss
the
matter
said
over
the
past
week
that
the
trump
administration
was
delaying
consideration
of
any
new
waivers
while
the
department
of
energy
reviews
its
scoring
system
for
applications
the
department
evaluates
waiver
requests
and
provides
recommendations
to
the
epa
that
has
placed
on
hold
seven
applications
for
the
compliance
year
and
applications
for
the
typically
the
epa
waits
until
the
latter
half
of
the
year
to
begin
reviewing
applications
because
applicants
need
to
demonstrate
financial
hardship
using
hard
figures
for
their
facilities
an
epa
official
confirmed
the
review
i
think
what
doe
needs
to
do
is
tighten
up
their
approach
and
we
need
to
do
the
same
said
the
official
who
asked
not
to
be
named
i
honestly
don
t
know
where
they
ll
end
up
and
whether
they
re
going
to
make
any
changes
at
whatever
the
outcome
it
could
have
a
dramatic
impact
on
the
credit
trading
market
which
has
been
by
the
waiver
expansion
credits
called
renewable
identification
numbers
or
rins
have
dropped
in
value
from
over
to
cents
this
week
as
reports
emerged
of
the
number
of
epa
waivers
granted
last
year
some
of
those
went
to
facilities
owned
by
big
profitable
companies
like
chevron
corp
and
andeavor
which
recently
merged
with
marathon
petroleum
corp
reuters
has
reported
that
cut
in
credit
prices
has
saved
merchant
refiners
that
lack
enough
biofuel
blending
facilities
like
valero
energy
corp
pbf
energy
inc
and
carl
icahn
s
cvr
energy
inc
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
compliance
costs
the
issue
has
placed
president
donald
trump
in
a
tough
spot
between
two
key
constituencies
as
he
tries
to
support
the
agriculture
industry
slammed
by
the
impact
of
his
trade
war
with
china
and
keep
costs
down
for
the
oil
industry
biofuel
supporters
had
argued
the
expansion
of
the
waiver
program
was
politically
driven
by
former
epa
administrator
scott
pruitt
an
oklahoman
considered
an
oil
industry
ally
pruitt
resigned
in
july
in
a
flurry
of
ethical
scandals
and
has
been
replaced
by
andrew
wheeler
a
former
coal
lobbyist
under
the
last
epa
chief
the
waiver
program
became
a
cookie
jar
open
to
every
refinery
owner
and
we
re
seeing
the
results
across
rural
america
with
biofuel
plants
closing
their
doors
or
idling
production
brook
coleman
head
of
the
advanced
biofuels
business
council
said
the
epa
has
blamed
the
program
s
expansion
on
recent
federal
court
rulings
triggered
by
challenges
filed
by
small
refining
companies
holly
frontier
and
sinclair
which
said
the
agency
was
using
too
strict
of
a
test
to
determine
disproportionate
hardship
all
hardship
applications
are
first
handled
by
the
energy
department
which
determines
whether
compliance
would
lead
to
disproportionate
impact
or
threaten
a
refinery
s
viability
the
final
decision
on
applications
rests
with
the
epa

valdmanis
