britain
plans
to
help
develop
the
country
s
first
project
to
capture
store
and
use
carbon
dioxide
emissions
by
the
the
department
for
business
energy
and
industrial
strategy
beis
said
on
wednesday
carbon
capture
storage
and
use
ccsu
involves
the
capture
of
emissions
from
power
plants
and
industry
to
allow
them
to
be
compressed
and
stored
to
be
used
for
industrial
applications
such
as
making
drinks
fizzy
the
technology
is
also
likely
to
be
needed
to
help
limit
a
rise
in
global
temperatures
at
degrees
celsius
according
to
a
recent
report
the
uk
s
first
carbon
capture
usage
and
storage
project
will
be
up
and
running
by
the
under
government
plans
unveiled
today
beis
said
in
a
statement
under
the
plans
britain
will
commit
to
setting
out
more
details
next
year
on
how
to
develop
the
country
s
first
large
scale
ccsu
project
and
invest
million
pounds
million
in
decarbonising
industrial
sites
the
uk
is
setting
a
ambition
for
developing
and
deploying
carbon
capture
and
storage
technology
to
cut
emissions
britain
s
energy
and

growth
minister
claire
perry
will
say
later
on
wednesday
at
a
ccsu
conference
in
edinburgh
according
to
the
beis
statement
british
power
company
drax
earlier
this
week
announced
a
pilot
ccsu
scheme
at
its
biomass
power
plant
in
north
yorkshire
but
britain
has
yet
to
develop
a
economically
viable
project
britain
had
previously
viewed
carbon
capture
and
storage
as
a
vital
tool
to
help
it
meet
its
legally
binding
target
to
cut
emissions
by
percent
on
levels
by
in
the
government
launched
a
billion
pound
competition
to
help
fund
a
project
to
capture
emissions
from
a
gas
or
power
plant
and
store
them
underground
despite
several
interested
companies
such
as
shell
and
sse
it
then
made
a
shock
decision
in
to
pull
funding
from
the
scheme
leaving
the
projects
in
limbo
there
are
fewer
than
ccsu
projects
in
operation
globally
but
many
more
will
be
needed
to
meet
the
challenge
of
climate
change
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
iea
without
ccus
as
part
of
the
solution
reaching
our
international
climate
goals
is
practically
impossible
iea
executive
director
fatih
birol
said
in
a
separate
statement
issued
ahead
of
the
edinburgh
conference
the
paris
climate
agreement
adopted
by
almost
nations
in
set
a
goal
of
limiting
warming
to
well
below
a
rise
of
degrees
celsius
above
times
while
pursuing
efforts
for
the
tougher
goal
of
degrees
celsius
