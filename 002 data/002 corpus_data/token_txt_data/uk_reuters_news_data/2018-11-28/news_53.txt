rattled

by
talking
tough
ahead
of
a
meeting
with

president
xi
jinping
in
argentina
on
saturday
white
house
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
sought
to
brighten
the
mood
by
holding
open
the
possibility
that
the
two
countries
would
reach
a
trade
deal
beijing
s
ambassador
to
washington
cui
tiankai
told
reuters
that
china
is
going
to
the
summit
hoping
for
a
deal
to
ease
a
damaging
trade
war
with
the
united
states
though
he
warned
of
dire
consequences
if
hardliners
try
to
separate
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
markets
were
shaken
on
tuesday
after
trump
told
the
wall
street
journal
it
was
highly
unlikely
he
would
accept
china
s
request
to
hold
off
on
a
planned
increase
in
tariffs
to
percent
from
percent
all
in
all
it
was
still
unclear
whether
the
two
sides
had
agreed
on
a
formal
agenda
for
the
meeting
after
the
summit
and
kudlow
said
there
were
no
scheduled
talks
on
the
ground
for
their
advisers
also
on
tuesday
a
german
magazine
published
a
report
citing
european
union
sources
saying
trump
could
impose
tariffs
on
imported
cars
from
next
week
which
sent
european
auto
stocks
sharply
lower
the
market
mood
has
turned
cautious
once
again
amid
a
flurry
of
trade
headlines
pointing
to
the
prospect
of
a
new
round
of
trade
tariffs
ahead
said
rodrigo
catril
senior
strategist
at
national
australia
bank
the
market
seems
to
be
jumping
at
shadows
at
the
moment
and
against
this
backdrop
of
uncertainty
the
usd
remains
the
preferred
option
for
weathering
the
the
dollar
index
which
measures
the
greenback

a

major
currencies
jumped
overnight
to
to
edge
towards
a

top
of
earlier
this
month
it
was
last
at
investors
will
now
turn
attention
to
a
speech
on
wednesday
by
federal
reserve
chair
jerome
powell
for
further
clues
on
how
many
more
times
the
central
bank
is
likely
to
raise
interest
rates
the
event
has
become
more
critical
as
signs
of
a
global
slowdown
and
nearly
two
months
of
market
volatility
have
clouded
an
otherwise
rosy
picture
prompting
speculation
the
fed
will
go
slow
on
rate
hikes
next
year
traders
will
watch
the
speech
in
light
of
trump
s
criticism
of
powell
in
a
newspaper
interview
in
which
the
president
said
interest
rates
and
other
fed
policies
were
damaging
the
economy
in
the
foreign
exchange
market

among
the
worst

uphill
struggle
to
convince
sceptical
voters
of
the
benefits
of
her
deal
for
businesses
may
needs
to
win
a
parliamentary
vote
on
her
brexit
deal
but
that
looks
difficult
with
an
apparent
large
majority

lawmakers
including
the
