the
main
challenger
in
nigeria
s
election
next
year
aims
to
outflank
president
muhammadu
buhari
by
campaigning
in
a
sometimes
neglected
part
of
the
country
where
the
incumbent
is
deeply
unpopular
the
southeast
with
a
tight
race
in
prospect
a
strong
showing
there
could
give
atiku
abubakar
the
votes
he
needs
to
deny
buhari
a
former
military
ruler
a
second
term
as
the
elected
leader
of
one
of
africa
s
most
powerful
nations
abubakar
is
targeting
regional
voters
who
are
mostly
members
of
the
igbo
ethnic
group
through
his
choice
of
a
local
running
mate
and
policies
designed
to
meet
calls
for
autonomy
the
numbers
are
tempting
there
were
million
registered
voters
in
the
five
states
of
the
southeast
out
of
million
nationwide
at
the
last
election
in
the
number
of
new
voters
registered
in
the
southeast
has
grown
faster
than
in
other
regions
according
to
electoral
commission
figures
seen
by
reuters
the
opposition
will
still
need
to
overcome
voter
apathy
in
the
southeast
where
people
have
long
felt
there
is
little
point
in
voting
since
presidents
tend
to
be
northerners
from
the
hausa
ethnic
group
or
yoruba
people
from
the
southwest
while
presidential
elections
in
nigeria
are
usually
cast
as
a
fight
between
the
mainly
muslim
north
and
the
predominantly
christian
south
victory
may
depend
on
a
candidate
attracting
votes
from
outside
his
ethnic
and
religious
base
at
this
stage
most
analysts
expect
a
closely
fought
contest
on
with
some
predicting
a
narrow
victory
for
abubakar
buhari
is
popular
across
the
north
so
it
suits
abubakar
to
target
a
region
where
the
president
lacks
support
buhari
s
unpopularity
in
the
southeast
stems
from
his
decision
to
send
troops
on
to
the
streets
last
year
to
crack
down
on
secessionists
the
issue
is
sensitive
for
many
the
deployment
was
a
reminder
of
the
war
over
biafra
a
breakaway
nation
that
was
predominantly
igbo
around
a
million
people
died
mostly
from
starvation
and
disease
before
central
government
forces
prevailed
and
many
in
the
southeast
feel
igbos
have
been
marginalised
ever
since
an
igbo
has
not
been
president
or
vice
president
since
nigeria
s
most
recent
transition
to
civilian
rule
in
if
there
are
votes
for
abubakar
in
the
southeast
he
may
also
win
support
among
the
many
igbos
living
elsewhere
in
nigeria
abubakar
named
peter
obi
a
former
southeastern
governor
as
his
running
mate
in
october
and
proposed
devolving
more
power
to
regions
in
a
policy
dubbed
restructuring
that
promises
to
give
states
greater
control
over
their
finances

chukwunonye
okereke
director
general

youths
for
atiku
a
pdp
organisation
said
the
people
in
the
southeast
have
not
been
treated
fairly
by
this
government
he
buhari
has
been
a
ruler
of
abubakar
himself
said
in
a
tweet
earlier
this
month
i
am
for
of
nigerians
of
the
time
nigerians
should
never
be
divided
by
ethnic
or
religious
lines
we
must
be
united
we
are
one
the
comment
may
have
struck
a
chord
in
the
southeast
since
it
reflects
criticism
that
buhari
has
governed
as
a
northern
president
concerned
only
with
northern
people
a
group
of
influential
igbo
traditional
rulers
earlier
this
month
endorsed
abubakar
a
move
that
gives
them
potential
access
to
important
patronage
networks
if
he
wins
buhari
is
unpopular
among
market
stallholders
and
shoppers
in
onitsha
the
biggest
city
in
anambra
state
i
don
t
want
buhari
any
longer
in
this
country
we
pray
there
will
be
a
change
said
ifeoma
eze
who
runs
a
business
selling
plantains
in
nigeria
everybody
is
crying
there
is
no
money
the
money
is
not
circulating
she
said
complaining
about
the
government
s
handling
of
the
economy
which
experienced
its
first
recession
in
years
in
only
emerging
last
year
eric
onyeka
who
runs
a
toiletries
stall
said
we
have
had
economic
instability
since
the
year
buhari
took
office
buhari
s
supporters
say
much
criticism
is
based
on
ethnic
and
religious
prejudices
rather
than
his
policies
the
current
infrastructure
that
has
been
put
in
place
surpasses
what
the
people
s
democratic
party
did
in
years
said
ebubeagu
okafor
a
spokesman
for
buhari
s
all
progressives
congress
apc
in
enugu
he
said
buhari
s
administration
had
improved
roads
between
the
region
s
major
cities
and
was
developing
a
railway
line
to
link
the
southeast
with
the
oil
heartland
and
the
northeast
okafor
also
cited
the
resumption
of
building
work
on
the
second
niger
bridge
a
major
river
crossing
as
an
example
of
buhari
s
commitment
to
the
region
abubakar
is
thought
to
be
betting
that
buhari
s
largesse
may
not
be
enough
to
win
the
region
atiku
is
probably
banking
on
a
growing
voter
population
in
these
traditional
pdp
strongholds
combined
with
a
higher
turnout
of
igbo
voters
who
want
to
see
an
igbo
vice
president
said
malte
liewerscheidt
west
africa
analyst
at
teneo
a
consultancy
liewerscheidt
also
said
abubakar
s
courting
of
the
igbo
vote
could
help
him
elsewhere
igbo
support
could
also
prove
decisive
in
other
regions
particularly
the
southwest
as
there
are
huge
igbo
communities
scattered
across
the
country
in
a
key
battleground
state
such
as
lagos
this
could
swing
the
vote
in
atiku
s
favour
