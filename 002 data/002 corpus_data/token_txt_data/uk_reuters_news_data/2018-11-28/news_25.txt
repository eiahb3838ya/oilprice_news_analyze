an

said
bernd
berg
global
macro
strategist
at
woodman
asset
management
but
if
they
come
out
with
nothing
this
weekend
it
s
going
to
be
very
futures
pointed
to
a
marginally
firmer
open
on
wall
street
the
uncertainty
over
global
trade
as
well
as
brexit
and
italy
s
conflict
with
the
european
union
have
supported
the
dollar
which
rose
to
a
high
against
a
basket
of
currencies
while
the
main
driver
for
the
greenback
is
the
interest
rate
path
rodrigo
catril
senior
strategist
at
national
australia
bank
said
it
was
also
benefiting
from
the
uncertain
mood
markets
seem
to
be
jumping
at
shadows
at
the
moment
and
against
this
backdrop
of
uncertainty
the
dollar
remains
the
preferred
option
for
weathering
the
storm
catril
said
with
the
currency
index
approaching
highs
reached
earlier
this
month
traders
are
focusing
on
a
speech
at
gmt
by
federal
reserve
chair
jerome
powell
to
see
if
he
offers
clues
on
how
many
more
times
the
fed
could
raise
interest
rates
while
fed
vice
chair
richard
clarida
took
a
less
dovish
stance
on
tuesday
than
some
had
expected
and
backed
more
rate
rises
powell
and
his
colleagues
have
in
recent
weeks
alluded
to
global
volatility
leading
many
to
speculate
the
bank
s
rate
rise
campaign
could
pause
in
berg
said
there
had
been
some
repricing
of
expectations
but
said
the
fed
remained
on
track
to
tighten
policy
in
december
and
at
least
my
base
case
is
the
dollar
will
strengthen
versus
the
euro
and
pound
into
as
the
euro
zone
and
britain
are
both
struggling
with
their
own
problems
brexit
and
italy
berg
said
sterling
was
flat
around
just
off
lows
as

prime

theresa
may
battles
to
convince
sceptical
voters
lawmakers
and

of
the
benefits
of

deal
may
needs
to
win
a
parliamentary
vote
on
the
deal
she
has
negotiated
with
the
eu
to
exit
the
bloc
but
with
most
parties
opposed
that
looks
unlikely
the
euro
is
languishing
at
also
near
lows
to
the
dollar
investors

were
