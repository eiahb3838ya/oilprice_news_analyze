washington
reuters
china
has
agreed
to
significantly
increase
its
purchases
of
goods
and
services
the
two
countries
said
on
saturday
but
made
no
mention
of
a
billion
target
the
white
house
had
touted
earlier
beijing
and
washington
agreed
they
would
keep
talking
about
measures
under
which
china
would
import
more
energy
and
agricultural
commodities
from
the
united
states
to
close
the
billion
annual
goods
and
services
trade
deficit
with
china
a
joint
statement
issued
at
the
conclusion
of
intensive
trade
talks
in
washington
did
not
indicate
whether
the
two
countries
would
delay
or
drop
their
tariff
threats
on
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
each
country
s
goods
which
has
sparked
fears
of
a
wider
trade
war
and
roiled
financial
markets
there
was
a
consensus
on
taking
effective
measures
to
substantially
reduce
the
united
states
trade
deficit
in
goods
with
china
the
joint
statement
said
to
meet
the
growing
consumption
needs
of
the
chinese
people
and
the
need
for
economic
development
china
will
significantly
increase
purchases
of
united
states
goods
and
president
donald
trump
has
threatened
to
impose
tariffs
on
up
to
billion
on
chinese
goods
to
combat
what
his
administration
says
is
beijing
s
misappropriation
of
intellectual
property
through
joint
venture
requirements
and
other
policies
that
force
technology
transfers
beijing
denies
such
coercion
and
has
threatened
equal
retaliation
including
tariffs
on
some
of
its
largest
imports
among
them
aircraft
soybeans
and
autos
a
report
by
china
s
xinhua
news
agency
described
the
statement
from
the
two
governments
as
vowing
not
to
launch
a
trade
war
against
each
while
the
statement
said
the
two
sides
would
engage
at
high
levels
and
seek
to
resolve
their
economic
and
trade
concerns
in
a
proactive
manner
it
made
no
mention
of
tariffs
it
said
there
was
consensus
between
washington
and
beijing
on
the
need
to
create
favourable
conditions
to
increase
trade
in
manufactured
goods
and
services
this
could
be
a
reference
to
china
s
previous
pledges
to
open
up
more
economic
sectors
to
services
a
commentary
published
by
xinhua
on
sunday
declared
the
statement
a
good
example
of
noting
that
it
would
help
america
reduce
its
trade
deficit
by
increasing
exports
to
china
and
allow
china
to
diversify
and
raise
the
quality
of
its
imports
it
also
argued
that
china
has
always
resisted
any
unreasonable
demands
by
the
united
states
never
compromising
or
accepting
restrictive
conditions
the
commentary
added
that
a
resolution
to
the
trade
dispute
will
be
complicated
difficult
and
take
a
long
time
the
united
states
will
also
send
a
team
to
china
to
work
out
the
details
of
increased
agricultural
and
energy
exports
the
countries
said
without
specifying
timing
a
senior
official
said
that
during
discussions
with
a
member
of
president
xi
jinping
s
office
china
was
considering
a
package
that
relied
on
major
purchases
of
liquefied
natural
gas
including
a
contract
for
a
firm
to
build
lng
receiving
and
processing
facilities
in
china
the
package
which
also
would
include
new
commitments
on
intellectual
property
protections
could
be
agreed
by
a
potential
visit
to
washington
by
china
s
vice
president
wang
qishan
the
official
said
trump
made
cutting
the
trade
deficit
with
china
a
promise
in
his
presidential
campaign
during
an
initial
round
of
talks
earlier
this
month
inbeijing
washington
demanded
that
china
reduce
its
trade
surplus
by
billion
a
figure
most
economists
say
is
impossible
to
achieve
because
it
would
require
a
massive
change
in
the
composition
of
commerce
between
the
two
countries
as
of
late
thursday
officials
were
still
pressing
china
to
agree
to
that
size
reduction
but
economists
say
that
level
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
achieve
especially
as
tax
cuts
are
spurring
demand
for
more
imports
the
billion
figure
is
equivalent
to
about
of
boeing
co
s
annual
aircraft
production
and
is
larger
than
all
of
the
united
states
global
annual
agricultural
and
oil
exports
eswar
prasad
a
cornell
university
trade
professor
and
former
head
of
the
international
monetary
fund
s
china
division
said
that
beijing
had
clearly
balked
at
a
specific
quantitative
commitment
it
is
a
very
limited
and
tentative
agreement
mainly
designed
to
deescalate
tensions
prasad
said
of
the
joint
statement
the
statement
was
vague
on
the
trump
administration
s
core
intellectual
property
complaints
saying
that
both
countries
attach
paramount
importance
to
intellectual
property
protections
china
will
advance
relevant
amendments
to
its
laws
and
regulations
including
the
patent
there
are
concerns
among
some
legislators
and
trade
experts
that
trump
could
give
priority
to
a
narrower
trade
deficit
over
tackling
what
they
say
is
china
s
abuse
of
intellectual
property
rights
any
deal
under
which
china
would
import
more
goods
could
easily
be
reversed
economists
say
the
statement
made
no
mention
of
whether
there
would
be
a
relaxation
of
paralysing
restrictions
on
chinese
telecommunications
equipment
maker
zte
corp
imposed
last
month
by
the
commerce
department
the
action
related
to
violation
of
sanctions
on
iran
banned
american
companies
from
selling
semiconductors
and
other
components
to
zte
causing
the
company
to
cease
operations
earlier
this
week
trump
tweeted
that
he
directed
the
commerce
department
to
put
zte
back
in
business
and
said
the
company
s
situation
was
part
of
an
overall
trade
deal
with
china
