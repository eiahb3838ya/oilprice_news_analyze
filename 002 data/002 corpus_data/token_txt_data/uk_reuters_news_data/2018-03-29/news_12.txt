update 3-firstenergy seeks emergency lifeline for u.s. nuclear, coal plants
new
reuters
power
company
firstenergy
corp
urged
the
federal
government
on
thursday
to
evoke
emergency
powers
to
help
it
keep
several
struggling
nuclear
and
power
plants
open
a
move
critics
blasted
as
an
attempt
at
a
corporate
bailout
on
wednesday
firstenergy
said
it
would
shut
several
nuclear
plants
in
ohio
and
pennsylvania
in
the
next
three
years
without
some
kind
of
state
or
federal
relief
firstenergy
s
firstenergy
solutions
unit
called
on
energy
secretary
rick
perry
to
use
the
emergency
powers
to
order
pjm
interconnection
the
regional
power
grid
operator
to
negotiate
a
contract
that
would
compensate
owners
of
coal
and
nuclear
plants
for
the
benefits
such
as
reliability
and
jobs
those
units
provide
pjm
in
response
rejected
the
need
for
an
emergency
order
nothing
we
have
seen
suggests
there
is
any
kind
of
emergency
from
these
units
retiring
said
vincent
duane
senior
vice
president
at
pjm
calling
the
problem
fundamentally
a
corporate
a
spokesman
for
firstenergy
solutions
declined
to
comment
on
thursday
about
speculation
the
unit
was
headed
for
bankruptcy
but
he
directed
attention
to
a
filing
the
company
made
with
the
energy
department
earlier
in
the
day
the
filing
included
a
comment
made
by
firstenergy
corp
s
chief
executive
charles
jones
in
february
that
he
would
be
shocked
if
firstenergy
solutions
did
not
file
for
some
type
of
bankruptcy
protection
by
the
end
of
march
coal
and
nuclear
power
plant
operators
have
struggled
in
recent
years
as
low
natural
gas
prices
as
a
result
of
the
shale
boom
have
spurred
utilities
to
retire
dirtier
coal
plants
last
year
perry
proposed
a
plan
that
would
subsidize
coal
and
nuclear
for
providing
what
is
known
as
generation
which
refers
to
units
that
run
around
the
clock
regulators
rejected
that
proposal
in
january
and
said
they
would
conduct
a
study
on
grid
resilience
many
grid
operators
including
pjm
have
said
they
already
factor
in
reliability
of
their
systems
and
the
fuel
resources
available
to
generate
electricity
murray
energy
corp
which
supplies
coal
to
firstenergy
and
has
been
lobbying
elected
officials
to
keep
coal
and
nuclear
plants
operating
said
it
fully
supports
the
request
for
emergency
relief
as
a
result
of
ferc
s
failure
critical
power
plants
will
close
thousands
of
american
jobs
will
be
lost
and
the
reliability
resiliency
and
security
of
our
electric
power
grids
will
be
forever
compromised
murray
energy
said
in
a
statement
referring
to
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
s
rejection
of
perry
s
resiliency
proposal
firstenergy
said
in
november
that
it
would
exit
the
competitive
generation
business
overseen
by
firstenergy
solutions
as
natural
gas
has
taken
up
a
greater
part
of
the
power
load
on
wednesday
firstenergy
solutions
said
it
told
pjm
it
would
retire
all
of
its
nuclear
reactors
in
ohio
and
pennsylvania
totaling
megawatts
mw
in
and
one
megawatt
is
enough
power
for
homes
firstenergy
said
it
wants
an
emergency
order
because
the
power
grid
s
reliability
is
threatened
due
to
the
premature
retirement
of
plants
that
have
many
years
of
useful
life
but
can
not
operate
profitably
under
current
market
pjm
said
however
that
firstenergy
s
assets
have
been
financially
stressed
for
some
the
energy
department
said
it
received
firstenergy
s
request
and
will
go
through
its
standard
review
process
it
did
not
comment
further
pjm
said
such
a
request
if
granted
would
effectively
circumvent
ferc
putting
it
in
uncharted
shares
in
firstenergy
closed
down
percent
to
on
thursday
the
use
of
emergency
orders
related
to
power
generation
has
been
minimal
having
been
evoked
only
eight
times
since
december
according
to
the
energy
department
usually
in
response
to
natural
disasters
or
blackouts
groups
that
rarely
agree
on
anything
condemned
firstenergy
s
request
the
american
petroleum
institute
api
a
trade
group
for
the
oil
and
natural
gas
industry
said
firstenergy
s
claim
that
the
electric
grid
would
be
in
immediate
danger
with
these
power
plant
retirements
is
simply
untrue
pjm
is
responsible
for
the
reliability
of
the
grid
and
if
there
is
an
emergency
pjm
already
has
the
tools
to
respond
api
said
in
a
statement
the
environmental
group
the
sierra
club
said
it
would
sue
if
perry
issues
any
order
to
bail
out
firstenergy
ratepayers
and
regulators
have
already
rejected
multiple
attempts
by
firstenergy
to
bail
out
these
coal
and
nuclear
plants
that
can
no
longer
compete
in
the
marketplace
mary
anne
hitt
director
of
the
sierra
club
s
beyond
coal
campaign
said
in
a
statement
other
companies
have
sought
assistance
from
federal
state
and
regional
officials
to
keep
their
coal
and
nuclear
plants
in
service
and
some
states
including
new
york
and
illinois
have
offered
subsidies
to
nuclear
plants
these
companies
argue
that
the
diversification
of
fuel
sources
is
necessary
to
keep
the
power
grid
operating
in
the
most
optimal
way
more
coal
plants
are
expected
to
be
decommissioned
in
coming
years
and
natural
gas
recently
surpassed
coal
as
the
biggest
source
of
power
generation
in
the
united
states
most
states
are
also
putting
rules
in
place
to
boost
generation
through
renewable
sources
