three
firms
that
bought
crude
oil
last
year
from
emergency
stockpiles
raised
concerns
about
dangerous
levels
of
a
poisonous
chemical
in
the
cargoes
according

problems
with
crude
quality
would
make
the
strategic
petroleum
reserve
spr
less
useful
in
an
emergency
because
refiners
would
need
to
spend
time
and
money
removing
contamination
before
producing
fuel
the
reserve
is
the
world
s
largest
government
stockpile
currently
holding
million
barrels
hydrogen
sulfide
occurs
naturally
in
crude
and
natural
gas
but
oil
producers
typically
decontaminate
such
products
before
delivery
to
buyers
high
levels
of
can
corrode
refinery
parts
and
pipelines
and
can
be
lethal
to
humans
in
gas
form
authorities
in
all
major
consuming
countries
keep
oil
in
reserve
to
ensure
that
they
do
not
run
out
of
crude
to
refine
into
fuels
if
a
natural
disaster
or
war
disrupts
global
supplies
the
government
established
its
reserve
in
following
the
arab
oil
embargo
the
department
of
energy
oversees
the
reserve
and
periodically
sells
some
of
its
oil
at
times
when
there
are
no
emergencies
as
it
did
with
the
sales
that
sparked
contamination

the

the

said
all
three
firms
bought
cargoes
of
spr
oil
stored
in
an
underground
salt
cavern
in
bryan

texas
last
year
the
oil
was
pumped
from

being
loaded
onto

wrote
to
the
department
adding
that
the
issue
caused
concern
at

crude
for
future
purchases
shell
declined
to
comment
on
its
complaint
to
the
government
the
oil
firm
s
emails
said
an
initial
test
sample
detected
gas
at
levels
of
less
than
five
parts
per
million
ppm
but
a
later
test
by
shell
after
it
shipped
the
crude
by
boat
to
another
location
showed
levels
of
parts
per
million
according
to
shell
s
emails
to
the

exposure
to
vapors
containing
ppm
of
could
cause
a
person
to
collapse
in
five
minutes
and
die
within
an
hour
according
to
the
occupational
safety
and
health
administration
in
november
australian
bank
macquarie
group
bought
the
third
shipment
from
the
spr
and
sold
it
to
petrochina
according
to
the
shipping
documents
reviewed
by
reuters
the
cargo
was
loaded
at
freeport
onto
a
ship
called
the
stena
sunrise
the
documents
show
a
testing
company
named
inspectorate
tested
a
sample
from
the
spr
cargo
purchased
by
macquarie
according
to
the
documents
and
found
levels
of
up
to
ppm
inspectorate
declined
to
comment
and
referred
questions
to
the

department
macquarie
declined
to
comment
after
the
inspectorate
testing
the
terminal
operator
refused
to
allow
workers
to
perform
additional
tests
out
of
concern
about
violating
safety
regulations
according
to
the
shipping
documents
it
is
unclear
if
petrochina
or
macquarie
decontaminated
the

petrochina
shipped
the
oil
to
china
where
it
arrived
on
according
to
thomson
reuters
shipping
data
reuters
was
not
able
to
determine
how
often
high
levels
of
are
detected
across
the
industry
but
industry
experts
and
chemical
petroleum
engineers
said
such
incidents
are
rare
some
crude
grades
can
have
levels
as
high
as
ppm
when
produced
said
ramanan
krishnamoorti
chief
energy
officer
and
a
professor
of
chemical
and
biomolecular
engineering
at
the
university
of
houston
but
producers
remove
most
of
that
before
transporting
crude
to
customers
contamination
could
result
from
blending
different
crude
grades
for
example
when
one
grade
of
crude
is
stored
in
a
tank
that
previously
contained
a
different
grade
krishnamoorti
said
there
has
to
be
some
concentrated
source
of
it
krishnamoorti
