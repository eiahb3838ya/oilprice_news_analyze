the
canadian

unexpectedly
shrank
by
percent
in
january
statistics
canada
data
indicated
on
thursday
in
a
clear
sign
that
growth
is
likely
to
be
weaker
than
the
bank
of
canada
had
predicted
analysts
in
a
reuters
poll
had
expected
gross
domestic
product
to
increase
by
percent
after
a
revised
percent
gain
in
december
january
s
drop
was
the
first
since
a
percent
decline
in
august
in
january
the
central
bank
forecast
annualized
growth
of
percent
but
it
looks
set
to
cut
that
estimate
when
it
issues
updated
numbers
on
april
the
underlying
story
is
that
growth
remains
on
a
sluggish
underlying
path
of
less
than
percent
for
the
bank
of
canada
this
reinforces
the
point
that
there
is
little
urgency
to
hike
rates
again

doug
porter
chief
economist
at
bmo
financial
group
the
central
bank
has
raised
interest
rates
three
times
since
last
july
and
says
future
moves
will
be
heavily
dependent
on
economic
data

noted
that

gdp
had
been
hit

cut
extraction
by
percent
while

march
gdp
but
we
re
going
to
revise
down
our
first
quarter
gdp
forecast
to

adding
weight
to
our
view
that
the
bank
of
canada
is
on
hold
until
july
