poll-oil to rise in 2018 as opec wages tug-of-war with u.s. shale
reuters
oil
prices
are
likely
to
rise
this
year
thanks
to
supply
disruptions
and
an
deal
to
limit
production
but
doubts
over
the
future
of
compliance
with
the
multilateral
agreement
and
rising
production
could
stem
the
upward
momentum
a
reuters
poll
showed
on
thursday
a
survey
of
economists
and
analysts
polled
by
reuters
showed
brent
crude
would
average
nearly
a
barrel
in
versus
forecast
in
the
february
survey
but
below
the
average
for
the
benchmark
so
far
in
brent
prices
have
risen
percent
this
year
supported
by
a
deal
between
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
producers
led
by
russia
to
curb
output
by
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
through
the
price
briefly
rose
above
a
barrel
this
week
supported
by
tension
in
the
middle
east
and
declining
output
in
venezuela
one
of
the
group
s
largest
producers
where
economic
crisis
has
cut
production
to
its
lowest
in
nearly
years
a
sustained
drawdown
in
inventories
also
helped
push
the
price
up
towards
a
peak
last
seen
in
december
we
view
it
rather
unlikely
that
opec
will
exit
already
by
however
talking
about
a
possible
extension
of
the
deal
beyond
we
are
rather
sceptical
hannes
loacker
of
raiffeisen
capital
management
said
we
see
a
big
challenge
in
bringing
in
russia
once
more
without
russian
participation
the
will
of
some
other
opec
members
may
also
be
abating
saudi
arabia
and
russia
are
working
on
a
pact
that
could
extend
controls
over
world
crude
supplies
by
major
exporters
for
many
years
even
if
opec
compliance
with
pledged
supply
remains
elevated
through
the
balance
of
the
explosive
growth
in
shale
oil
supply
accompanied
by
growth
in
crude
oil
export
capacity
will
likely
tip
the
balance
towards
lower
oil
prices
in
the
second
half
bnp
paribas
analyst
harry
tchilinguirian
said
analysts
expect
production
to
grow
by
at
least
million
bpd
this
year
output
now
stands
at
nearly
million
bpd
taking
it
past
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
and
within
reach
of
biggest
producer
russia
the
balance
between
strong
production
growth
in
the
on
the
one
hand
and
continued
restraint
by
opec
and
russia
on
the
other
remains
the
key
factor
on
the
supply
side
said
cailin
birch
an
analyst
at
the
economist
intelligence
unit
on
the
demand
side
emerging
asia
will
remain
the
key
region
for
new
demand
the
international
energy
agency
said
this
month
that
global
oil
demand
would
increase
by
million
bpd
by
to
million
bpd
boosted
by
economic
growth
in
asia
and
a
resurgent
petrochemicals
industry
analysts
said
oil
prices
could
also
be
pushed
up
by
fears
of
renewed
sanctions
on
iranian
oil
exports
after
the
united
states
threatened
to
withdraw
from
a
nuclear
deal
light
crude
will
average
a
barrel
in
the
poll
found
up
from
forecast
in
february
elsewhere
the
recent
launch
of
china
s
oil
futures
which
many
expect
to
become
a
third
global
price
benchmark
alongside
brent
and
wti
made
a
roaring
start
as
western
players
and
chinese
majors
