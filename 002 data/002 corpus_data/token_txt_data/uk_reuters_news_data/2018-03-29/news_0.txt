refile-update 1-un aviation agency eyes talks, meeting to defuse gulf airspace standoff
reuters
the
united
nations
aviation
agency
is
trying
to
facilitate
talks
between
qatar
and
its
neighbours
to
defuse
tensions
over
alleged
airspace
violations
but
will
not
intervene
politically
in
the
dispute
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
this
week
the
international
civil
aviation
organization
icao
is
working
to
organise
a
regional
meeting
for
gulf
civil
aviation
and
air
traffic
authorities
in
the
next
few
weeks
as
part
of
broader
efforts
to
improve
communication
one
of
the
sources
said
earlier
this
week
the
united
arab
emirates
accused
qatari
fighter
jets
of
flying
dangerously
close
to
two
of
its
civilian
aircraft
the
latest
of
several
incidents
raising
tension
in
the
region
sometimes
if
you
re
having
a
feud
with
your
neighbour
you
need
someone
to
facilitate
the
conversation
the
source
said
icao
can
not
impose
binding
rules
on
governments
but
wields
clout
through
its
safety
and
security
standards
which
are
approved
by
its
member
states
icao
spokesman
anthony
philbin
said
by
email
that
the
agency
is
presently
monitoring
these
incidents
and
working
with
all
of
the
countries
concerned
to
help
keep
the
skies
in
this
part
of
the
world
open
safe
and
icao
s
governing
council
however
is
not
planning
to
intervene
in
these
latest
disputes
over
airspace
infringement
said
the
second
source
improving
communication
is
key
because
qatar
has
limited
airspace
and
is
part
of
bahrain
s
flight
information
region
the
first
source
said
both
aviation
industry
sources
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
the
talks
are
confidential
bahraini
qatari
and
uae
officials
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
since
january
the
gulf
states
have
traded
accusations
over
infringements
of
their
respective
airspace
in
june
the
uae
bahrain
saudi
arabia
and
egypt
cut
political
economic
and
transport
ties
with
qatar
accusing
it
of
supporting
islamist
extremists
qatar
denies
the
accusations
the
dispute
has
the
potential
to
disrupt
flights
in
a
region
with
millions
of
travellers
each
year
qatar
airways
has
flown
longer
routes
since
the
uae
blocked
it
from
its
airspace
a
passenger
jet
belonging
to
dubai
s
emirates
the
region
s
biggest
airline
was
involved
in
a
january
incident
when
two
qatari
air
force
jets
allegedly
flew
dangerously
close
doha
denies
the
allegations
in
june
icao
s
governing
council
is
expected
to
hear
arguments
by
the
gulf
states
over
the
boycott
which
qatar
is
challenging
said
the
second
source
icao
last
year
helped
qatar
airways
access
contingency
routes
over
international
waters
the
story
corrects
to
show
that
icao
has
member
states
