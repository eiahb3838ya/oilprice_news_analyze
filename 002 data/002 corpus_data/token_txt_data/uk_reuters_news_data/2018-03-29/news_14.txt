executives
have
not

negotiated
with
the

they
have
urged
pruitt
and
president
donald

to
revise
the

to
make

less

roughly
doubling
by

about
miles
km
per
gallon
the
average
fuel
efficiency
of
new

sold
in

but
the
obama
rules
included
a
review
by

as
to
whether
the
final
years
were
feasible
or
not
by
declaring
the
obama
rules
not
appropriate
the
trump
administration
can
reopen
the
process
of
setting

by
automakers
in
pruitt
is
expected
to
declare
that
the
existing
model
year
rules
on
fuel
economy
must
be
revised

he
is
not
expected
to
immediately
propose
new
requirements
people
familiar

said
they
asked

chief

jim
lentz
said
at
an
reuters
event
on
thursday
that

would
face
higher
costs
if

by
each
individual
state
lentz
said
individual
state
emissions
requirements
could
result
in
toyota
getting
towards
the
end
of
the
year
and
i
no
longer
can
sell
suvs
depending
on
the
state
s
fuel
economy
numbers
it
would
be
an
absolute
nightmare
for
us
to
figure
when
fuel
rules
were
written
in
amid
high
gas
prices
fuel
efficiency
was
the
second
highest
attribute
considered
by
