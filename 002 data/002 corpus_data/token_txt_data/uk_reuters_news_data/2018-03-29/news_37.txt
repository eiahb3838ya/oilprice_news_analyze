update 1-abb on the hunt for acquisitions in artificial intelligence
zurich
reuters
swiss
engineering
company
abb
is
considering
acquisitions
to
increase
its
capabilities
in
artificial
intelligence
chief
executive
ulrich
spiesshofer
said
on
thursday
we
will
continually
further
expand
the
portfolio
of
abb
he
said
speaking
on
the
sidelines
of
the
company
s
annual
general
meeting
in
zurich
this
would
include
investment
in
organic
growth
in
artificial
intelligence
ai
and
partnerships
with
other
companies
to
accelerate
areas
such
as
linking
ai
to
industrial
robots
abb
whose
products
also
include
charging
stations
for
electric
cars
and
massive
converters
for
transmission
systems
would
also
invest
selectively
in
companies
spiesshofer
said
he
was
speaking
after
abb
gave
a
slightly
more
upbeat
assessment
about
the
development
of
its
markets
for
saying
conditions
had
brightened
the
company
has
navigated
a
tough
couple
of
years
with
plummeting
demand
from
its
oil
gas
and
mining
customers
and
has
rejected
calls
from
an
activist
investor
to
spin
off
its
power
grids
business
during
this
time
abb
has
simplified
its
structure
into
four
divisions
sold
off
fringe
businesses
and
exited
operations
in
the
low
margin
and
risky
engineering
and
construction
area
if
you
take
our
end
markets
in
the
last
couple
of
years
there
has
been
a
massive
contraction
in
the
process
industries
and
uncertainty
in
some
other
markets
spiesshofer
told
reporters
after
the
agm
is
really
the
first
year
where
we
see
none
of
our
market
segments
contracting
they
are
either
stable
or
growing
that
means
the
world
is
starting
into
with
a
positive
late
cycle
businesses
such
as
machinery
for
the
oil
and
gas
industry
were
also
stabilizing
he
added
with
the
company
seeing
early
activities
on
operating
expenditure
and
service
orders
from
oil
gas
and
mining
companies
we
see
increasing
discussion
for
future
projects
so
altogether
the
late
cycle
will
stop
getting
worse
in
and
towards
the
end
of
the
year
we
expect
the
market
to
get
a
little
better
spiesshofer
said
although
current
global
trade
tensions
could
have
a
dampening
effect
on
overall
investment
sentiment
president
donald
trump
earlier
this
month
pushed
ahead
with
the
imposition
of
metal
tariffs
though
he
later
announced
exemptions
for
some
countries
sparking
concerns
of
trade
war
trump
last
week
signed
a
presidential
memorandum
targeting
up
to
billion
in
chinese
goods
with
tariffs
after
abb
s
overhaul
chairman
peter
voser
said
now
was
the
time
for
the
company
to
deliver
we
have
outlined
the
strategy
we
have
worked
on
the
portfolio
both
in
and
out
so
the
scene
is
set
he
told
reporters
we
have
finished
from
an
operational
point
of
view
the
restructuring
programs
it
is
now
about
execution
of
the
strategy
it
is
delivery
