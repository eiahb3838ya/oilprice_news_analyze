egyptian
officials
were
counting
votes
on
thursday
after
an
election
set
to
hand
president
abdel
fattah
a
second

a
crackdown
on
dissent
that
removed
serious
challengers
as
ballots
are
tallied
for
official
results
due
on
april
the
focus
will
be
on
final
turnout
since
sisi
faced
no
credible
opposition
critics
say
the
contest
recalled
the
kind
of
vote
that
kept
arab
autocrats
in
power
for
decades
before
the
arab
spring
the
former
military
commander
overthrew
islamist
mohamed
mursi
egypt
s
first
president
during
turmoil
in
that
followed
a
popular
uprising
two
years
earlier
sisi
was
first
elected
in
with
percent
of
the
vote
but
with
a
modest
turnout
of
about
percent
authorities
have
been
desperate
to
ensure
a
higher
turnout
this
time
around
as
sisi
sees
attendance
at
polls
as
a
referendum
on
his
popularity
and
seeks
a
strong
mandate
to
fight
militants
and
push
through
tough
economic
reforms
media
trumpeted
sisi
s
victory
early
on
thursday
after
the
election
predicted
a
big
turnout
and
radio
programmes

of
the
voters
were
from

people
have
chosen
their
president

the
first
two
days
of
voting
turnout
was
about
percent

sources
monitoring
the

tuesday
it
was
between
and
percent
the
two
sources
said
late
on
wednesday
the
turnout
figure
could
be
less
than
percent
egyptian
authorities
and
media
outlets
have
tried
to
garner
as
many
votes
as
possible
telling
voters
it
is
their
duty
and
portraying
a
failure
to
vote
as
betrayal
of
their
country
other
tactics
have
also
been
deployed
with
some
voters
saying
they
were
paid
and
given
other
incentives
to
cast
their
ballots
sisi
ran
against
a
sole
challenger
who
openly
supports
him
after
all
serious
opposition
dropped
out
the
race
earlier
this
year
citing
intimidation
and
arrests
sisi
s
presidency
has
returned
the
military
to
power
after
turmoil
following
the
uprising
that
toppled
