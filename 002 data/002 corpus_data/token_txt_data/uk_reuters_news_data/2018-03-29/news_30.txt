president
donald
trump
s
advisers
have
urged
him
to
let
congress
take
the
lead
in
efforts
to
lower
the
cost
of
the
nation
s
biofuels
policy
for
refining
companies
and
to
use
executive
action
only
if
lawmakers
fail
to
make
progress
according
to
three
sources
familiar
with
the
discussions
the
recommendation
underscores
the
difficulties
the
white
house
has
faced
in
attempting
to
tweak
the
renewable
fuel
standard
a
law
intended
to
help
farmers
and
reduce
fuel
imports
that
has
for
years
divided
the
corn
and
oil
industries
the
rfs
requires
refiners
to
cover
the
price
of
blending
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
fuel
supply
creating
a
lucrative
market
for
growers
but
a
headache
for
refiners
who
say
it
costs
them
a
fortune
trump
s
white
house
has
hosted
a
series
of
meetings
in
recent
months
between
the
key
political
constituencies
aimed
at
finding
or
changes
acceptable
to
both
sides
including
potentially
capping
the
price
of
blending
credits
that
refiners
must
acquire
to
prove
compliance
but
the
efforts
exposed
gaping
divisions
between
the
corn
and
oil
lobbies
along
with
disagreements
between
integrated
refiners
like
bp
and
exxonmobil
and
merchant
refiners
like
pbf
energy
over
solutions
that
means
any
action
by
the
white
house
will
upset
at
least
one
faction
of
trump
s
base
according
to
the
sources
who
asked
not
to
be
named
as
they
were
discussing
a
confidential
matter
two
of
the
sources
said
that
trump
had
agreed
to
heed
his
advisers
recommendation
to
leave
the
issue
to
congress
while
leaving
open
the
option
to
act
if
congress
balks
the
third
source
said
it
was
not
yet
clear
what
trump
would
do
white
house
spokeswoman
kelly
love
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
officials
at
the
environmental
protection
agency
which
administers
the
rfs
and
the
department
of
agriculture
also
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
epa
head
scott
pruitt
and
agricultural
secretary
sonny
perdue
have
been
compiling
a
list
of
executive
and
administrative
level
options
for
trump
to
consider
to
tweak
the
rfs
the
sources
said
the
list
would
likely
include
caps
on
compliance
credits
and
lifting
summertime
restrictions
on
the
use
of
blends
of
gasoline
shifting
the
issue
to
lawmakers
would
put
the
spotlight
on
texas
republican
senator
john
cornyn
who
has
been
leading
legislative
efforts
to
reform
the
rfs
cornyn
s
office
says
it
has
been
trying
to
win
support
from
the
corn
and
oil
industries
for
a
comprehensive
reform
bill
that
is
still
being
drafted
underscoring
the
stakes
merchant
refiner
philadelphia
energy
solutions
filed
bankruptcy
in
january
blaming
the
cost
of
compliance
for
their
financial
woes
reuters
reported
that
other
factors
may
also
have
played
a
role
in
the
bankruptcy
including
the
withdrawal
of
more
than
million
in
payments
from
the

its
investor
