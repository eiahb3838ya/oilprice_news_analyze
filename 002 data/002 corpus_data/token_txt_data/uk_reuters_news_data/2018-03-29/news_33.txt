earlier
this
month
the
uss
carl
vinson
became
the
first
american
aircraft
carrier
to
visit
vietnam
since
the
vietnam
war
ended
in
coming
alongside
the
news
that
a
record
nations
from
southeast
asia
and
beyond
would
be
joining
biennial
naval
exercises
in
the
eastern
indian
ocean
it
was
a
potent
reminder
of
just
how
eager
the
nations
surrounding
the
south
china
sea
are
to
embrace
powerful
allies
to
fend
off
a
rising
china
but
as
beijing
s
regional
clout
continues
to
grow
it
can
be
hard
for
weaker
nations
to
resist
it
even
with
these
allies
support
barely
three
weeks
after
the
vinson
s
visit
the
vietnamese
government
bowed
to
chinese
pressure
and
canceled
a
major
oil
drilling
project
in
disputed
south
china
waters
it
was
yet
another
sign
of
the
region
s
rapidly
shifting
dynamics
for
the
last
decade
the
united
states
and
its
asian
allies
have
been
significantly
bolstering
their
military
activities
in
the
region
with
the
explicit
aim
of
pushing
back
against
china
but
beijing
s
strength
and
dominance
along
with
its
diplomatic
economic
and
military
reach
continues
to
grow
dramatically
over
the
last
week
beijing
has
conducted
major
military
drills
including
reportedly
sending
its
aircraft
carrier
through
the
taiwan
strait
and
flying
jets
between
japan
s
southernmost
islands
the
latter
of
which
was
explicitly
described
by
the
chinese
military
as
a
preparation
for
future
wars
these
drills
are
both
a
response
to
recent
military
actions
and
a
bold
statement
of
china
s
intent
to
keep
up
the
pressure
western
military
strategists
worry
that
china
will
in
time
be
able
to
block
any
activity
in
the
region
by
the
united
states
and
its
allies
already
satellite
photos
show
china
installing
sophisticated
weapons
on
a
range
of
islands
where
international
law
says
they
simply
should
not
be
present
in
any
war
these
and
other
new
weapons
that
china
is
acquiring
could
make
it
all
but
impossible
for
the
navy
and
other
potential
enemies
of
china
to
operate
in
the
area
at
all
a
simple
issue
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
problem
beijing
s
claim
to
sovereignty
over
almost
the
entire
south
china
sea
basin
that
assertion
first
made
by
the
exiled
republic
of
china
government
in
taiwan
in
and
then
repeated
by
its
mainland
communist
counterpart
since
was
flatly
rejected
by
a
united
nations
tribunal
in
but
that
hasn
t
stopped
beijing
from
doing
more
and
more
to
secure
its
position
in
the
area
china
s
increasing
confidence
in
asserting
control
over
the
south
china
sea
has
clearly
alarmed
its
neighbors
particularly
the
philippines
vietnam
malaysia
indonesia
and
brunei
all
of
whom
have
competing
territorial
claims
over
waters
that
china
claims
for
itself
but
it
also
represents
a
major
and
quite
deliberate
challenge
to
the
united
states
which
as
an
ally
to
all
these
nations
has
essentially
staked
its
own
credibility
on
the
issue
over
the
last
several
years
it
has
become
common
practice
for
warships
to
sail
through
nearby
waters
pointedly
refusing
to
acknowledge
chinese
demands
that
they
register
with
its
air
and
maritime
identification
zones
which
the
united
states
and
its
allies
do
not
recognize
the
last
such
voyage
dubbed
a
freedom
of
navigation
operation
or
in
naval
parlance
a
fonop
took
place
on
friday
when
the
destroyer
mustin
reportedly
passed
within
nautical
miles
of
mischief
reef
in
the
spratly
islands
which
is
claimed
by
both
china
and
the
philippines
the
mischief
reef
fonop
fits
a
much
wider
pattern
of
increasingly
assertive
naval
activities
by
washington
and
its
allies
in
the
region
earlier
this
month
the
united
states
announced
the
first
deployment
of
its
vertical
takeoff
joint
strike
fighter
by
far
the
most
sophisticated
aircraft
of
its
type
to
an
amphibious
assault
ship
in
the
region
this
kind
of
military
tit
for
tat
appears
to
be
escalating
china
now
says
it
plans
monthly
military
exercises
in
the
south
china
sea
a
substantial
increase
that
will
likely
be
met
by
intensified
american
and
allied
activity
a
british
warship
is
shortly
scheduled
to
conduct
its
own
fonop
and
the
united
states
has
pushed
australia
to
join
the
program
although
whether
it
will
do
so
remains
a
topic
of
considerable
debate
within
the
country
none
of
this
however
addresses
the
seismic
regional
change
produced
by
china
s
strategy
over
the
last
five
years
china
has
built
ever
more
sophisticated
military
and
industrial
outposts
on
disputed
atolls
and
reefs
in
some
cases
transforming
scrubby
patches
of
rock
that
barely
broke
the
surface
into
large
concrete
installations
once
a
tiny
fishing
station
on
stilts
mischief
reef
is
now
a
chinese
military
base
and
china
s
efforts
continue
aided
by
a
giant
new
dredging
vessel
that
its
chinese
designers
have
touted
as
a
magical
filipino
officials
say
they
believe
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
before
beijing
makes
similar
moves
at
scarborough
shoal
within
striking
distance
of
major
filipino
population
centers
and
military
facilities
if
and
when
that
happens
the
philippines
along
with
the
united
states
will
face
a
difficult
decision
about
how
best
to
respond
at
stake
here
are
more
than
energy
resources
although
the
estimated
billion
barrels
of
oil
and
nearly
trillion
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas
that
the
south
china
sea
is
believed
to
contain
are
clearly
a
factor
in
the
conflict
but
more
broadly
china
sees
this
confrontation
as
a
test
case
for
its
ability
to
impose
its
will
on
the
wider
region
and
so
far
it
is
winning
at
the
very
least
foreign
energy
firms
are
now
unlikely
to
bid
to
drill
in
disputed
waters
spanish
oil
firm
repsol
is
said
to
have
lost
up
to
million
after
chinese
pressure
prompted
vietnam
to
cancel
its
planned
exploration
the
united
states
remains
the
world
s
preeminent
military
superpower
and
there
is
little
doubt
it
could
win
a
fight
with
china
almost
anywhere
else
in
the
world
in
its
own
backyard
however
beijing
is
making
it
increasingly
clear
that
it
calls
the
shots
and
for
now
there
is
little
sign
anyone
in
washington
or
anywhere
else
has
the
appetite
to
seriously
challenge
that
assumption
