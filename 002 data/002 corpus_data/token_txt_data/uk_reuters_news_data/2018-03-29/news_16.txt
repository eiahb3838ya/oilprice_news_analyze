new

march
reuters
a
pennsylvania
judge
on
thursday
urged
the
state
s
public
utility
commission
to
reject
buckeye
partners
lp
s
proposal
to
reverse
the
western
portion
of
a
product
pipeline
that
extends
from
philadelphia
to
pittsburgh
pennsylvania
administrative
law
judge
eranda
vero
s
action
represented
a
setback
for
buckeye
and
its
efforts
to
reverse
the
laurel
pipeline
in
the
pittsburgh
region
to
move
refined
products
eastward
which
would
offer
midwest
refiners
led
by
marathon
petroleum
greater
access
to
western
pennsylvania
the
state
s
public
utility
commission
has
the
final
say
on
reversal
but
the
judge
s
recommendation
carries
significant
weight
while
we
are
still
reviewing
the
decision
and
we
appreciate
the
administrative
law
judge
s
consideration
of
our
proposal
which
will
create
important
benefits
for
pennsylvania
consumers
we
respectfully
disagree
with
her
conclusion
buckeye
said
in
statement
refiners
such
philadelphia
energy
solutions
and
delta
air
lines
subsidiary
monroe
energy
opposed
the
reversal
saying
it
would
harm
their
business
and
lead
to
closures
they
argued
it
would
take
away
a
key
market
and
cause
fuel
price
spikes
in
western
pennsylvania
we
commend
the
judge
s
decision
the
only
winners
of
a
laurel
reversal
would
be
buckeye
and
refineries
a
coalition
of
groups
including
refiners
said
in
a
statement
vero
said
buckeye
failed
to
prove
that
the
pipeline
was
underutilized
and
that
consumers
would
be
uninjured
among
other
issues
laurel
has
overstated
the
overall
impact
of
the
decrease
on
the
use
of
the
pipeline
section
in
question
the
judge
wrote
the
judge
also
rejected
buckeye
s
argument
that
the
company
did
not
need
state
approval
to
reverse
the
line
midwest
refiners
such
as
marathon
and
husky
energy
have
invested
billions
of
dollars
in
recent
years
to
take
advantage
of
cheaper
canadian
crude
these
refiners
were
hoping
to
extend
their
ability
to
deliver
products
deeper
into
pennsylvania
opening
the
door
for
a
full
reversal
all
the
way
to
philadelphia
