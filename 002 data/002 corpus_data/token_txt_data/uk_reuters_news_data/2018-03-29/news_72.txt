european
trader
vitol
is
storing
gasoline
on
tankers
offshore
singapore
asia
s
biggest
oil
trading
centre
for
the
first
time
since
amid
oversupply
and
weak
demand
for
the
fuel
said
four
people
that
participate
in
the
market
on
wednesday
the
sources
said
that
vitol
was
seen
storing
gasoline
aboard
more
than
one
lr
tanker
the
company
does
not
typically
comment
on
its
trading
operations
at
least
one
of
the
vessels
is
the
tanker
glory
crescent
a
tanker
said
one
of
the
four
sources
the
vessel
is
deadweight
tonnes
and
could
carry
the
equivalent
of
about
barrels
of
gasoline
according
to
data
on
thomson
reuters
eikon
the
glory
crescent
was
fixed
on
by
a
charterer
that
was
not
revealed
for
a
to
time
charter
for
storage
the
aframax
vessel
is
currently
at
anchor
offshore
the
the
data
show
since
the
start
of
gasoline
market
has
been
in
a
contango
structure
where
prices
are
lower
than
prices
which
is
indicative
of
a
weak
market
this
month
the
contango
between
march
and
april
prices
widened
to
as
much
as
cents
a
barrel
typically
traders
can
store
fuel
in
a
contango
market
in
expectation
of
the
later
rising
prices
but
the
current
contango
does
not
justify
according
to
the
sources
the
contango
is
not
wide
enough
to
encourage
storing
gasoline
but
vitol
may
have
its
own
economics
for
doing
so
said
one
of
the
sources
in
traders
including
vitol
unipec
total
and
gunvor
were
storing
gasoline
aboard
vessels
off
singapore
as
the
contango
deepened
to
a
barrel
so
far
vitol
is
the
only
company
storing
fuel
the
sources
said
they
were
not
expecting
more
to
follow
suit
although
the
market
remained
saddled
with
supplies
despite
recent
refinery
outages
in
taiwan
and
ongoing
refinery
maintenance
in
north
asia
the
latest
data
from
singapore
s
international
enterprise
ie
showed
that
onshore
light
distillates
stocks
held
in
the
week
to
tuesday
were
at
a
record
of
million
barrels
over
in
europe
gunvor
litasco
trafigura
socar
as
well
as
vitol
had
already
used
vessels
to
store
gasoline
this
month
following
slow
demand
for
petrol
from
the
united
states
refinery
runs
in
the
atlantic
basin
are
at
elevated
levels
despite
turnaround
activities
this
had
a
cascading
effect
on
singapore
cracks
as
the
still
sets
the
tone
for
regional
gasoline
cracks
said
sri
paravaikkarasu
of
fge
overall
gasoline
demand
in
asia
this
year
is
expected
to
lag
she
added
the
gasoline
crack
refers
to
the
profit
from
refining
a
barrel
of
oil
into
petrol
