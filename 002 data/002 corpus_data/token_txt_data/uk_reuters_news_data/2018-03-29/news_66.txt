asset
management
in

equities
in

will
receive
support
from

easing
of

regarding
north
korea
with
countries
like
japan
seeking
a
summit
ichikawa
added
japan

after
kim
met
with
chinese
president
xi

the
yen
often
sought
in
times
of

turmoil
and
political
tensions
retraced
the

it
made
against

earlier

the

the

a
side
deal
to
deter

focus
was
on
whether
the
trump
administration
would
press
china
for
currency
reassurances
as
part
of
the
trade
negotiations
like
those
secured
from
south
korea
fears
of
a
trade
war
have
eased
on
hopes
that
negotiations
can
bring
a
compromise
but
concerns
remained
expansionary
fiscal
policy
should
support
global
trade
but
markets
will
remain
attentive
to
further
tensions
as
the
trade
saga
continues
to
unfold
