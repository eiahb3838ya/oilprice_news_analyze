when
the
ceo
of
algeria
s
state
energy
company
sonatrach
ended
a
speech
to
staff
by
seeking
questions
an
executive
sitting
next
to
him
quickly
picked
up
the
microphone
there
are
no
questions
he
said
and
some
employees
filed
straight
out
the
scene
revealed
the
scale
of
the
challenge
facing
abdelmoumen
ould
kadour
who
took
over
sonatrach
a
year
ago
with
a
mission
to
improve
communication
and
transparency
in
a
company
that
is
central
to
stability
in
algeria
and
beyond
sonatrach
funds
percent
of
the
state
budget
and
falling
oil
prices
have
created
pressure
for
change
while
algeria
s
role
as
a
major
gas
supplier
to
europe
means
new
tension
between
the
continent
and
gas
giant
russia
could
play
into
his
hands
he
will
soon
unveil
a
plan
to
lift
stagnant
output
and
has
revived
ties
with
european
oil
majors
but
project
delays
fraud
scandals
secrecy
and
red
tape
abound
in
a
country
where
adults
remember
civil
war
and
change
is
often
resisted
it
s
hopeless
he
confided
to
colleagues
accompanying
him
to
the
company
office
in
the
northwestern
city
of
oran
one
of
dozens
of
such
visits
by
the
alumnus
of
mit
and
harvard
to
sonatrach
outposts
witnessed
by
reuters
on
his
first
day
he
said
on
another
occasion
he
was
given
so
much
paperwork
to
sign
he
feared
he
would
do
little
else
there
was
no
medium
and
long
term
strategy
there
was
no
communication
no
coordination
between
sonatrach
s
executives
every
single
piece
of
information
was
no
stranger
to
setbacks
he
spent
two
years
in
an
algerian
jail
for
collaborating
with
foreigners
after
a
decade
in
charge
of
a
joint
engineering
company
by
oil
services
firm
halliburton
he
has
brought
in
his
own
team
to
lead
the
revamp
at
sonatrach
declining
requests
for
an
interview
but
sharing
his
views
during
his
tour
of
the
company
a
company
source
said
his
turnaround
plan
would
be
unveiled
within
weeks
if
not
days
designed
partly
to
attract
foreign
investment
it
is
likely
to
come
during
or
before
a
conference
he
hosts
on
april
which
the
ceos
of
france
s
total
italy
s
eni
and
norway
s
statoil
are
expected
to
attend
his
broad
goal
is
to
turn
sonatrach
into
an
integrated
energy
company
by
from
its
current
sprawling
state
which
includes
an
aircraft
maker
and
extensive
social
programmes
and
excludes
renewables
which
come
under
the
environment
ministry
while
western
ceos
will
expect
concrete
steps
after
years
of
bold
announcements
the
plan
has
spread
unease
among
executives
several
of
whom
told
reuters
they
feared
sweeping
management
changes
in
ould
kadour
s
declared
battle
with
red
tape
in
oran
he
told
staff
that
statoil
set
to
resume
work
at
the
hassi
mouina
gas
field
had
previously
left
because
of
bureaucracy
better
communication
a
better
environment
is
key
to
convince
foreign
partners
to
work
in
algeria
he
said
a
sonatrach
source
said
statoil
is
expected
to
invest
mln
in
gas
a
figure
described
by
a
statoil
source
as
speculation
last
month
statoil
and
britain
s
bp
agreed
to
strengthen
cooperation
in
upstream
oil
exploration
and
explore
solar
energy
to
allow
algeria
to
export
more
of
its
gas
in
december
ould
kadour
revived
ties
in
december
with
total
eni
and
saipem
but
his
ability
to
nurture
those
relationships
and
reverse
years
of
stalling
production
will
depend
on
how
his
company
s
employees
respond
to
his
message
of
change
he
is
an
unlikely
manager
in
a
country
known
for
secrecy
and
a
suspicion
of
westerners
dating
from
ties
to
the
soviet
union
and
the
trauma
of
the
independence
war
with
france
but
energy
revenues
have
halved
since
and
president
abdelaziz
bouteflika
the
old
leader
who
might
run
for
a
fifth
term
next
year
is
struggling
to
maintain
a
welfare
state
necessary
for
social
stability
the
government
has
launched
austerity
measures
banning
the
import
of
goods
and
freezing
public
sector
hiring
and
development
projects
doctors
and
teachers
have
been
on
strike
in
several
cities
for
three
months
demanding
better
pay
and
conditions
and
the
state
has
been
unable
to
end
dissent
by
paying
out
as
it
did
when
a
barrel
of
crude
cost
instead
of
as
now
this
has
turned
improving
the
efficiency
of
the
state
oil
company
into
a
political
imperative
ould
kaddour
has
no
choice
but
to
succeed
as
sonatrach
s
ceo
a
former
energy
minister
told
reuters
critics
of
the
ceo
say
he
has
only
been
appointed
because
of
bouteflika
and
will
last
no
longer
than
his
many
predecessors
if
bouteflika
quits
ould
kaddour
would
be
sacked
in
the
next
five
minutes
a
former
sonatrach
executive
said
with
the
presidential
election
looming
ould
kadour
has
sought
to
cut
algeria
s
import
bill
by
recruiting
oil
trader
vitoil
to
swap
crude
for
the
petrol
in
growing
need
at
home
the
strategy
was
to
show
that
algeria
which
is
a
big
oil
producer
is
not
spending
gigantic
sums
on
imports
of
products
an
oil
insider
said
one
delayed
gas
field
was
brought
online
last
year
with
three
more
slated
to
start
producing
this
year
lifting
annual
gas
output
of
billion
cubic
metres
by
billion
cubic
metres
sonatrach
has
signed
a
billion
deal
with
turkey
to
build
a
petrochemical
facility
discovered
crude
in
niger
and
explored
cooperation
with
iraq
it
is
also
considering
shale
but
protests
in
from
algerians
fearing
environmental
damage
have
made
that
politically
unpalatable
for
now
in
further
signs
of
a
balancing
act
company
sources
say
sonatrach
will
offer
more
flexible
gas
contracts
on
terms
of
years
or
less
instead
of
and
invest
million
in
the
tinhert
gas
field
project
using
algerian
firms
ould
kadour
s
sentencing
by
a
military
court
in
on
charges
working
for
a
foreign
country
was
part
of
an
internal
regime
conflict
typical
for
algeria
observers
say
an
elite
made
up
of
the
ruling
fln
party
army
and
security
has
controlled
algeria
since
independence
with
officials
or
executives
of
state
firms
sometimes
losing
jobs
when
a
new
faction
takes
over
in
power
plays
behind
closed
doors
after
serving
his
jail
term
he
worked
in
qatar
france
senegal
and
the
united
arab
emirates
before
bouteflika
made
him
sonatrach
ceo
in
march
anis
rahmani
owner
of
private
ennahar
tv
station
said
the
ceo
had
told
him
he
was
devastated
by
being
branded
a
traitor
but
the
man
has
vision
a
plan
to
transform
the
company
into
a
modern
and
performing
one
which
is
not
the
case
now
he
said
he
is
more
powerful
than
the
energy
minister
one
insider
said
but
must
also
win
backing
from
politicians
resistant
to
opening
up
the
country
too
much
a
key
energy
law
has
been
stalled
for
years
but
a
draft
is
now
due
in
july
it
is
likely
to
retain
sonatrach
s
majority
stake
in
all
energy
projects
but
offer
tax
incentives
for
investors
a
sonatrach
executive
said
the
law
needs
to
be
attractive

not
it
