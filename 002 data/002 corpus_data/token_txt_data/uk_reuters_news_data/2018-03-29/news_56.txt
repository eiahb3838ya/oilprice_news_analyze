update 1-britain's greenhouse gas emissions fall again as coal use plummets

britain
s
greenhouse
gas
ghg
emissions
fell
by
percent
last
year
from
levels
largely
due
to
a
decline
in
power
generation
and
marking
the
fifth
straight
yearly
drop
preliminary
government
data
showed
on
thursday
output
of
the
gases
in

fell

thursday
s
data
shows
britain
s
ghg
emissions
have
fallen
percent
since
meaning
it
is
more
than
half
way
towards
meeting
a
legally
binding
target
to
cut
its
ghg
emissions
by
to
percent
below

fell

emissions
fell

dropped
