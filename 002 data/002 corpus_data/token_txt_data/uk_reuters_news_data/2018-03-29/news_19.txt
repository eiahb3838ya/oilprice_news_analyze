egyptians
to
the
polls
the
vote
this
week

long
been
set

a
dummy
candidate
critics

the
contest
recalled
the
kind
of
vote
that
kept
arab
autocrats
in
power
for
decades
before
the
arab
spring
with
the
election
seen
by
many
including
sisi
as
a
referendum
on
his
presidency
the
focus
is
on
turnout
which
he
has
sought
to
support
tough
economic
reforms
and
a
fight
against
islamist
militants
critics
say
austerity
and
an
unprecedented
crackdown
on
dissent
have
eroded
sisi
s
popularity
but
supporters
say
such
measures
are
needed
to
stabilise
the
north
african
country
after
years
of
unrest
that
followed
a
popular
uprising
the
former

commander
overthrew

said
on
his
official
twitter
account
the
images
of
egyptians
in
front
of
polling
stations
makes
me
proud
and
is
proof
of
the
greatness
of
our
authorities
urged
as
many
eligible
voters
as
possible
to
cast
their

with
state

portraying
a

sole
challenger

widely
been

the
efforts
that
have
been
made
to
raise
the
numbers
timothy
kaldas
fellow
at
the
tahrir
institute
for
middle
east
policy
said
but
it
s
not
clear
what
consequence
the
turnout
will
really
have
on
a
government
that
doesn
t
appear
to
believe
the
people
should
have
a
say
in
who
