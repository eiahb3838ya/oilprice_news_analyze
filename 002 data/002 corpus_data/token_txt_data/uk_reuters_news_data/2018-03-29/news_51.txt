toyota
motor
corp
and
suzuki
motor
corp
agreed
on
thursday
to
produce
cars
for
each
other
in
india
as
toyota
aims
to
increase
its
market
share
in
the
world
s
passenger
car
market
the
agreement
follows
an
r
d
announced
by
the
two
japanese
automakers
a
year
ago
and
will
see
toyota
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
automakers
secure
production
from
its
much
smaller
rival
which
dominates
india
with
its
of
affordable
compact
cars
suzuki
will
supply
gasoline
and
hybrid
versions
of
its
baleno
hatchback
along
with
the
vitara
brezza
compact
suv
to
toyota
while
the
latter
will
produce
gasoline
and
corolla
sedans
for
suzuki
the
automakers
said
analysts
said
the
arrangement
would
help
toyota
expand
its
presence
in
india
where
it
has
struggled
to
grow
sales
due
to
lean
demand
for
its
models
india
is
a
big
blemish
on
toyota
s
otherwise
strong
track
record
for
breaking
into
emerging
markets
said
janet
lewis
head
of
asia
transportation
research
at
macquarie
securities
by
selling
rebadged
and
slightly
changed
balenos
and
vitaras
toyota
can
bolster
its
distribution
network
and
move
more
towards
expanding
its
market
manufacturing
will
begin
by
under
the
deal
vehicles
made
by
suzuki
will
be
rebranded
and
renamed
as
toyota
cars
while
the
toyota
vehicles
will
sport
the
suzuki
badge
a
toyota
spokeswoman
declined
to
give
details
on
production
figures
while
the
nikkei
business
daily
reported
that
toyota
would
supply
around
vehicles
to
suzuki
while
suzuki
would
produce
up
to
units
annually
for
toyota
the
deepening
partnership
between
the
two
automakers
will
enable
suzuki
to
tap
into
toyota
s
r
d
firepower
to
develop
vehicles
and
cars
areas
which
suzuki
has
admitted
it
is
struggling
to
keep
up
with
the
two
companies
plan
to
introduce
electric
cars
in
india
around
suzuki
has
dominated
the
indian
automobile
market
through
a
majority
stake
in
maruti
suzuki
india
ltd
the
country
s
largest
automaker
which
sold
roughly
million
vehicles
last
year
accounting
for
every
other
car
sold
in
the
country
producing
vehicles
for
toyota
would
represent
just
a
sliver
of
what
suzuki
sold
in
india
in
toyota
lags
far
behind
with
a
roughly
percent
market
share
an
additional
units
could
push
toyota
s
annual
sales
above
those
of
honda
motor
and
tata
motors
but
it
will
still
lag
far
behind
the
top
three
manufacturers
suzuki
hyundai
motor
co
and
mahindra
mahindra
last
year
toyota
sold
roughly
cars
in
india
leaving
its
two
plants
in
the
country
to
operate
at
about
half
their
capacity
of
manufacturing
more
than
vehicles
a
year
toyota
has
produced
cars
specifically
for
the
indian
market
for
years
but
sales
have
been
dented
by
poor
demand
of
its
last
two
models
made
specifically
for
india
the
etios
sedan
and
the
liva
hatchback
which
were
criticised
for
compromising
on
quality
and
finish
to
keep
costs
low
the
supply
from
suzuki
would
alleviate
pressure
on
toyota
to
develop
its
own
models
for
the
country
under
its
daihatsu
compact
car
brand
which
has
made
limited
progress
in
developing
affordable
appealing
models
for
emerging
markets
in
the
past
toyota
had
looked
to
daihatsu
for
help
to
develop
affordable
competitive
cars
in
india
but
its
engineers
and
parts
purchasing
managers
have
told
reuters
that
establishing
supply
chains
from
scratch
which
can
compete
with
suzuki
s
would
be
