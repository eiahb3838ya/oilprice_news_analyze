eliud
njoroge
and
his
wife
were
inside
their
house
in
kenya
s
rift
valley
when
a
crack
appeared
in
the
cement
floor
and
started
spreading
as
they
raced
out
they
already
knew
it
was
more
than
a
construction
fault
other
cracks
had
started
to
appear
on
their
town
s
main
road
a
major
thoroughfare
to
the
maasai
mara
nature
reserve
after
weeks
of
rain
floods
and
tremors
in
the
days
that
followed
geologists
started
to
take
full
stock
of
the
disaster
a
giant
fissure
kilometers
long
slicing
through
the
road
and
surrounding
countryside
a
harsh
reminder
that
kenya
s
majestic
rift
valley
a
tourist
hotspot
sits
on
some
of
the
most
unstable
ground
on
the
continent
my
wife
screamed
for
the
neighbors
to
come
and
help
us
remove
our
belongings
njoroge
said
remembering
when
they
first
noticed
the
crack
in
their
home
in
the
town
of
mai
mahiu
on
march
in
the
days
that
followed
the
house
became
so
unstable
it
had
to
be
demolished
njoroge
was
left
searching
for
salvage
in
the
piled
up
bricks
and
corrugated
tin
sheets
the
couple
are
still
looking
for
a
place
to
stay
the
road
was
fixed
in
a
day
but
the
fissure
has
forced
other
families
to
leave
and
geologists
have
warned
it
could
spread
further
with
more
heavy
rains
expected
over
the
next
two
months
people
on
the
ground
should
be
sensitive
especially
when
it
rains
checking
whether
there
are
cracks
ground
that
is
sinking
or
tremors
said
geologist
david
adede
the
cracks
run
almost
in
a
straight
line
so
you
can
project
if
you
see
a
crack
coming
your
way
get
away
he
added
in
the
very
long
term
over
the
next
tens
of
millions
of
years
geologists
say
the
underlying
tectonic
fault
could
split
the
continent
in
two
in
the
meantime
geologists
have
warned
that
authorities
need
to
do
more
to
take
fault
lines
into
account
as
they
plan
their
new
roads
rail
lines
and
infrastructure
projects
they
constructed
the
road
without
knowing
there
was
a
fault
line
that
s
why
the
contractors
are
on
standby
since
they
don
t
know
where
the
crack
is
going
