the
hague
reuters
the
dutch
government
said
on
thursday
it
will
phase
out
gas
production
at
the
groningen
field
once
europe
s
largest
by
as
part
of
efforts
to
reduce
the
danger
caused
by
small
but
damaging
earthquakes
production
is
set
for
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
this
year
already
down
from
a
peak
of
bcm
in
following
a
series
of
cuts
as
decades
of
extraction
have
led
to
dozens
of
earthquakes
each
year
damaging
thousands
of
homes
and
buildings
our
intention
is
to
cut
production
to
get
towards
bcm
in
the
coming
four
or
five
years
and
to
zero
at
the
end
of
the
coming
decade
prime
minister
mark
rutte
told
a
press
conference
a
chart
produced
by
the
dutch
economy
ministry
showed
production
falling
to
below
bcm
for
the
production
year
beginning
october
and
to
below
bcm
for
the
year
assuming
average
temperatures
economy
minister
eric
wiebes
confirmed
there
will
be
reductions
in
both
years
but
will
not
make
his
official
decision
on
production
until
he
has
received
advice
on
safety
considerations
this
summer
wiebes
said
the
cuts
will
be
achieved
in
part
by
forcing
large
industrial
users
to
seek
other
sources
of
energy
by
in
addition
the
netherlands
is
building
a
conversion
plant
to
make
foreign
gas
suitable
for
use
in
dutch
systems
foreign
users
of
dutch
gas
in
germany
and
belgium
will
be
encouraged
to
seek
other
sources
and
their
contracts
not
renewed
while
dutch
households
will
be
incentivized
to
reduce
gas
use
and
switch
to
heating
systems
dutch
wholesale
prices
at
the
ttf
hub
were
little
changed
after
the
statement
both
the
summer
and
winter
contracts
were
up
less
than
one
euro
cent
trading
at
euros
per
mwh
and
respectively
this
is
in
the
neutral
to
slightly
bullish
range
said
oliver
sanderson
a
thomson
reuters
gas
analyst
of
the
government
s
base
case
scenario
our
view
for
this
gas
year
oct
is
around
bcm
however
the
groningen
quota
should
continue
to
be
seen
as
low
and
a
general
cause
of
price
spikes
in
cold
weather
he
said
noting
that
storages
have
been
depleted
after
a
cold
winter
the
government
said
last
month
that
it
intended
to
cut
production
at
the
field
from
current
levels
of
bcm
per
year
to
bcm
as
quickly
as
possible
after
the
country
s
northern
region
was
hit
by
the
strongest
earthquake
in
years
in
january
