president
donald
trump
s
advisers
have
urged
him
to
leave
biofuels
policy
reform
efforts
to
congress
after
months
of
work
to
broker
a
deal
between
rival
corn
and
oil
industries
got
bogged
down
in
dispute
the
recommendation
to
back
away
underscores
the
difficulty
of
getting
two
key
political
constituencies
to
agree
on
the
future
of
the
renewable
fuel
standard
a
law
that
requires
refiners
to
cover
the
cost
of
blending
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
fuel
supply
the
law
has
created
a
big
new
market
for
farmers
but
also
a
headache
for
refiners
who
say
costs
have
soared
in
the
last
few
years
trump
s
white
house
has
hosted
a
series
of
meetings
in
recent
months
between
representatives
of
the
two
sides
the
meetings
are
aimed
at
finding
or
changes
to
lower
the
cost
of
the
program
to
refiners
including
capping
the
price
of
blending
credits
refiners
need
to
prove
compliance
they
follow
failed
efforts
last
year
by
independent
refiners
and
billionaire
investor
carl
icahn
who
owns
refining
company
cvr
energy
to
convince
the
administration
to
overhaul
the
rule
unilaterally
icahn
came
under
fire
early
last
year
during
a
brief
period
when
he
was
advising
trump
as
he
attempted
to
broker
a
deal
with
the
biofuels
industry
to
change
the
rule
he
later
ended
his
advisory
role
amid
charges
and
as
those
efforts
produced
forceful
reactions
from
iowa
lawmakers
the
nation
s
largest
state
the
white
house
efforts
have
further
exposed
gaping
divisions
between
the
corn
and
oil
lobbies
and
disagreement
over
the
solutions
between
integrated
refiners
like
bp
and
exxonmobil
and
merchant
refiners
like
pbf
energy
that
means
any
action
by
the
white
house
will
upset
at
least
one
faction
of
trump
s
base
according
to
the
sources
who
asked
not
to
be
named
as
they
were
discussing
a
confidential
matter
two
of
the
sources
said
trump
had
agreed
to
heed
his
advisers
recommendation
to
leave
the
issue
to
congress
while
also
leaving
open
the
option
to
act
if
congress
balks
this
seems
like
the
logical
place
to
land
given
all
the
unrest
said
one
of
the
sources
the
third
source
said
it
was
not
clear
what
trump
would
do
white
house
spokeswoman
kelly
love
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
officials
at
the
environmental
protection
agency
which
administers
the
rfs
and
the
department
of
agriculture
also
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
epa
head
scott
pruitt
and
agricultural
secretary
sonny
perdue
have
been
compiling
a
list
of
executive
and
options
for
trump
to
consider
to
tweak
the
rfs
the
sources
said
shifting
the
issue
to
lawmakers
however
would
put
the
spotlight
on
texas
republican
senator
john
cornyn
who
has
been
leading
legislative
efforts
to
reform
the
rfs
cornyn
s
office
says
it
has
been
trying
to
win
support
from
the
corn
and
oil
industries
for
a
comprehensive
reform
bill
that
is
still
being
drafted
underscoring
the
stakes
merchant
refiner
philadelphia
energy
solutions
filed
bankruptcy
in
january
blaming
the
cost
of
compliance
for
its
financial
woes
reuters
reported
that
other
factors
may
also
have
played
a
role
in
the
bankruptcy
including
the
withdrawal
of
more
than
million
in
payments
from
the
company
by
its
investor
owners
