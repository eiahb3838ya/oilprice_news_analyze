first
it
was
a
supermarket
aisle
free
of
plastics
now
the
netherlands
has
notched
up
another
novel
solution
in
its
fight
against
waste
and
pollution
products
made
with
food
that
otherwise
would
be
chucked
in
the
bin
soups
and
chutneys
made
from
wonky
vegetables
beer
from
stale
bread
cider
from
blemished
apples
and
soaps
from
discarded
orange
peels
are
selling
fast
in
the
wageningen
branch
of
jumbo
one
of
the
biggest
dutch
supermarket
chains
sales
have
surpassed
expectations
said
george
verberne
an
entrepreneur
who
runs
the
branch
about
km
miles
north
of
the
capital
amsterdam
we
sold
about
items
in
one
week
it
s
double
what
we
sell
for
organic
products
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
a
phone
interview
i
m
proud
and
very
happy
we
re
the
first
to
do
verberne
and
dutch
companies
launched
the
verspilling
is
verrukkelijk
or
waste
is
delicious
initiative
last
week
supported
by
a
local
university
as
part
of
a
new
national
programme
united
against
food
waste
the
government
is
aiming
to
halve
the
amount
of
food
thrown
away
by
its
million
people
to
become
the
first
country
in
europe
to
meet
this
global
development
goal
by
globally
one
third
of
all
food
produced
worth
nearly
trillion
is
thrown
away
every
year
according
to
the
united
nations
food
and
agriculture
organization
fao
critics
say
this
is
not
only
unethical
in
a
world
where
hunger
levels
are
rising
but
also
environmentally
destructive
the
dutch
organic
chain
ekoplaza
set
up
in
february
what
it
said
was
the
world
s
first
supermarket
aisle
which
has
led
to
calls
for
others
to
follow
suit
the
idea
of
selling
food
whose
appearance
does
not
meet
supermarket
standards
was
born
when
verberne
saw
a
presentation
on
food
waste
by
toine
timmermans
of
wageningen
university
research
and
offered
to
help
timmermans
who
has
worked
on
sustainable
food
issues
for
years
asked
for
shelf
space
to
showcase
products
made
from
waste
and
see
how
consumers
responded
at
least
entrepreneurs
across
europe
offer
products
using
surplus
food
but
they
tend
to
be
small
and
have
limited
impact
he
said
in
a
phone
interview
if
you
want
to
solve
food
waste
and
achieve
sustainable
food
systems
you
need
to
work
with
people
who
have
access
to
the
market
like
retail
stores
he
said
researchers
from
the
university
will
monitor
sales
over
the
next
six
months
to
learn
how
best
to
expand
the
products
chantal
engelen
of
kromkommer
one
of
companies
participating
in
waste
is
delicious
said
about
percent
of
carrots
get
rejected
because
they
have
two
legs
are
too
big
or
too
crooked
we
buy
them
straight
from
the
grower
for
a
fair
price
and
turn
them
into
healthy
food
she
said
adding
that
their
ultimate
aim
is
to
change
consumer
behaviour
so
that
the
reject
carrots
are
sold
in
shops
and
kromkommer
s
work
become
obsolete
the
netherlands
is
a
small
nation
but
it
is
one
of
the
world
s
largest
agricultural
exporters
waste
is
delicious
said
it
plans
to
expand
to
three
more
supermarkets
in
the
next
few
months
timmermans
is
glad
to
see
that
higher
pricing
than
established
brands
has
not
deterred
customers
we
can
not
sell
for
less
because
for
the
social
innovators
this
is
their
source
of
income
he
said
so
working
together
and
the
message
by
buying
this
you
re
contributing
to
a
better
world
is
a
very
important
verberne
believes
wonky
vegetables
have
a
bright
future
a
lot
of
colleagues
called
me
and
sent
me
emails
asking
how
does
it
work
can
i
also
do
something
like
this
he
said
i
think
we
have
to
do
this
this
planet
