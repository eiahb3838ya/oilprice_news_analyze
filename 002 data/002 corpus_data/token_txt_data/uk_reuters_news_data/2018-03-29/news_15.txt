new

reuters
stocks
steadied
on
thursday
after
a
woeful
week
for
major
technology
companies
even
as
global
equities
careened
towards
their
first
quarterly
drop
in
two
years

retaking
the
market
s
leadership
mantle
despite
equities
gains
bonds
also
advanced
in
price
the
volatile
during
the
week
and
quarter
would
seem
to
set
the
table
for
tense
months
ahead
as
bulls
look
for
corporate
earnings
to
validate
the
market
s
current
levels
and
bears
work
to
expose
investors
complacency
yet
david
kelly
chief
global
strategist
at
jpmorgan
chase
co
s
funds
division
said
he
is
optimistic
that
markets
have
clarified
the
effects
of
a
large
tax
cut
and
the
prospect
for
higher
interest
rates
factors
he
says
challenged
markets
during
the
first
quarter
it
s
not
that
the
uncertainties
have
gone
away
on
higher
rates
or
lower
taxes
but
i
think
we
ve
grown
accustomed
to
them
and
that
should
lay
a
foundation
for
investors
to
put
more
money
to
work
he
said
economic
data
on
thursday
showed
consumer
spending
rising
only
marginally
but
the
number
of
americans
filing
for
unemployment
benefits
dropped
to
a
more
than
low
last
week
monthly
inflation
readings
moderated
those
statistics
helped
keep
downward
price
swings
at
bay
on
thursday
after
a
turbulent
start
to
in
financial
markets
that
is
set
to
end
one
of
the
longest
quarterly
bull
runs
and
included
the
rise
in
wall
street
s
fear
gauge
the
cboe
volatility
index
a
that
sent
the
msci
s
world
share
index
up
more
than
percent
in
january
suddenly
melted
away
as
tensions
over
global
trade
escalated
turmoil
deepened
in
the
white
house
and
technology
firms
wobbled
on
fears
of
regulation
and
other
issues
the

is
down
more
than
percent
in
price
terms

year
now
the
dow
s

ftse
nikkei
and
scores
of
other
major
indexes
are
all
also
down
for
the

and
there
was
little
place
to
hide
with
bond

worries
have
spooked
global
investors
into
cutting

exposure
to
a
low
and
holdings
of
stocks
to
the
lowest
in
nearly
two
years
roger
jones
the
head
of

at
london
capital
said
he
hopes
the
equity
market
s
selloff
from
its
highs
is
not
prolonged
the
longer
this
goes
the
higher
the
chance
it
will

jones
benchmark
treasury
notes
rose

from

late
on
wednesday
that
market
action
pushed
the
gap
between

treasury
yields
to
its
tightest
in
a

some
investors
see
the
narrowing
as
a
sign
the
economy
will
sputter
in
addition
to
that
curve
flattening
the

marked
by
