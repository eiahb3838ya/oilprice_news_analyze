exclusive-venezuela eyes first-ever refining of foreign oil -documents
houston
reuters
venezuela
is
considering
producing
fuels
from
foreign
crude
oil
for
the
first
time
according
to
planning
documents
seen
by
reuters
as
the
country
struggles
to
meet
its
obligations
despite
having
the
world
s
largest
crude
reserves
oil
company
pdvsa
may
process
up
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
foreign
crude
in
june
at
the
country
s
largest
refinery
according
to
a
monthly
refining
plan
which
was
viewed
by
reuters
on
wednesday
the
output
would
help
fulfil
fuel
contracts
for
russian
chinese
and
other
customers
and
reduce
purchases
of
fuels
for
domestic
use
the
documents
showed
pdvsa
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
pdvsa
has
been
falling
short
on
fuel
exports
in
recent
years
due
to
a
lack
of
lighter
crudes
to
refine
a
shortage
of
spare
parts
poor
maintenance
and
management
upheaval
at
its
domestic
refining
network
pdvsa
also
lost
access
in
may
to
inventories
produced
in
curacao
where
it
operates
the
isla
refinery
declining
revenue
resulting
from
falling
oil
production
and
exports
have
driven
venezuela
into
a
severe
economic
recession
and
led
to
a
loss
of
skilled
workers
and
widespread
food
and
medicine
shortages
some
energy
experts
say
further
production
declines
could
contribute
to
a
global
crude
shortfall
conocophillips
last
month
seized
some
of
pdvsa
s
assets
in
the
caribbean
seeking
payment
for
a
billion
billion
arbitration
award
reducing
pdvsa
s
ability
to
deliver
fuel
and
crude
exports
to
asian
customers
and
regional
allies
venezuela
an
opec
member
country
has
never
before
imported
foreign
crude
oil
for
its
domestic
refineries
although
it
has
blended
african
russian
and
crudes
with
its
extra
heavy
oil
to
make
exportable
products
it
also
has
purchased
foreign
oil
for
caribbean
refineries
and
to
supply
allies
including
cuba
output
in
may
the
country
produced
million
bpd
of
crude
according
to
numbers
delivered
to
opec
but
other
sources
put
the
figure
at
million
bpd
which
would
be
the
lowest
monthly
output
since
the
if
pdvsa
chooses
to
refine
the
imported
crude
one
of
two
scenarios
outlined
in
documents
showing
its
production
supply
and
contract
requirements
the
imports
would
alleviate
a
lack
of
domestic
lighter
crudes
needed
at
the
refineries
which
have
been
running
at
about
a
third
of
their
capacity
it
could
use
russian
iranian
or
angolan
crudes
according
to
the
documents
the
larger
processing
of
crude
would
increase
our
fuel
availability
it
would
also
decrease
the
requirements
to
import
of
vacuum
gasoil
and
diesel
said
one
of
the
documents
prepared
in
may
the
alternative
not
using
imported
crude
would
mean
the
shortfall
in
fulfilling
contracts
to
supply
fuel
would
increase
the
document
showed
most
of
these
fuel
contracts
cover
with
chinese
and
russian
companies
as
of
june
two
tankers
holding
russian
urals
crude
were
waiting
in
venezuelan
waters
to
discharge
according
to
thomson
reuters
vessel

one
of
the
two
the
advantage
atom
is
waiting
near
its
amuay
refinery
venezuela
in
january
started
routine
imports
of
urals
crude
to
supply
cuban
refineries
spending
nearly
million
on
the
purchases
for
its
caribbean
ally
the
urals
cargoes
had
been
discharged
in
curacao
for
transfer
to
cuba
but
since
conoco
began
seizing
pdvsa
s
caribbean
assets
tankers
arriving
from
russia
have
been
diverted
to
venezuela
s
paraguana
refining
center
crp
which
includes
its
amuay
and
cardon
refineries
to
meet
its
domestic
demands
and
pdvsa
s
fuel
supply
contracts
venezuela
would
have
to
produce
some
bpd
of
fuels
the
documents
show
neither
of
the
june
alternatives
show
it
getting
close
to
that
level
if
pdvsa
decides
to
process
the
foreign
crude
it
would
produce
bpd
and
less
if
it
does
not
from
january
through
march
pdvsa
s
refineries
supplied
percent
of
the
bpd
of
the
fuels
demanded
by
venezuela
s
domestic
market
which
forced
the
company
to
import
finished
products
including
gasoline
and
diesel
under
the
plan
excluding
foreign
oil
imports
pdvsa
s
domestic
refineries
this
month
would
work
at
about
percent
of
their
total
capacity
or
bpd
of
venezuelan
crude
according
to
the
documents
reflecting
an
acute
lack
of
spare
parts
and
delayed
maintenance
projects
on
wednesday
pdvsa
s
cardon
refinery
restarted
a
vacuum
distillation
unit
that
was
waiting
for
spare
parts
to
be
repaired
last
week
the
refinery
restarted
one
of
its
crude
distillation
units
those
repairs
are
just
some
of
the
many
still
pending
according
to
the
documents
at
venezuela
s
smallest
refineries
puerto
la
cruz
and
el
palito
the
lack
of
medium
and
light
crudes
has
kept
several
distillation
units
out
of
service
for
months
the
insufficient
fuel
production
is
affecting
china
s
cnpc
and
its
subsidiaries
the
most
as
pdvsa
would
have
to
ship
bpd
of
fuel
oil
and
jet
fuel
to
these
companies
for
repaying
chinese
loans
extended
to
the
venezuelan
government
in
the
last
decade
but
it
typically
delivers
less
than
bpd
russia
s
rosneft
this
month
is
entitled
to
bpd
of
fuel
oil
jet
fuel
and
natural
gasoline
under
contracts
while
cuba
and
members
of
petrocaribe
should
receive
at
least
bpd
according
to
current
contracts
