asian
shares
edged
down
on
thursday
after
the
federal
reserve
raised
interest
rates
and
took
a
more
hawkish
tone
in
forecasting
a
slightly
faster
pace
of
tightening
for
the
rest
of
the
year
while
concerns
about
trade
frictions
kept
investors
on
edge
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
lost
percent
in
early
trade
south
korea
s
kospi
was
off
percent
while
australia
s
market
slipped
percent
japan
s
nikkei
shed
percent
the
fed
raised
its
benchmark
overnight
lending
rate
a
quarter
of
a
percentage
point
to
a
range
of
percent
to
percent
as
expected
on
the
back
of
strong
economic
growth
the
markets
however
latched
on
to
a
change
in
fed
policymakers
rates
projections
which
pointed
to
two
additional
hikes
by
the
end
of
this
year
compared
to
one
previously
based
on
board
members
median
forecast
the
spectre
of
higher
borrowing
costs
hit
stocks
while
boosting
bond
yields
and
the
dollar
the
overall
market
reaction
was
however
when
you
look
more
closely
only
eight
board
members
saw
two
more
hikes
by
the
end
of
year
compared
to
seven
who
saw
one
hike
in
march
it
was
seven
versus
eight
so
you
are
talking
about
a
change
of
only
one
board
member
after
all
said
norihiro
fujito
senior
investment
strategist
at
mitsubishi
ufj
morgan
stanley
securities
the
fact
that
markets
quickly
reversed
their
course
suggests
the
fed
s
decision
was
broadly
in
line
with
expectations
he
said
on
wall
street
the
s
p
lost
percent
and
the
nasdaq
composite
dropped
percent
the
treasuries
yield
hit
a
high
of
percent
before
quickly
slipping
back
to
percent
keeping
investors
in
check
were
concerns
about
threats
to
impose
tariffs
on
billions
of
dollars
in
chinese
goods
president
donald
trump
will
meet
with
his
top
trade
advisers
on
thursday
to
decide
on
whether
to
activate
the
tariffs
a
senior
trump
administration
official
said
in
the
currency
market
the
dollar
had
erased
all
its
gains
as
traders
focus
quickly
shifted
to
the
european
central
bank
s
policy
meeting
later
in
the
day
recent
comments
from
top
ecb
officials
have
sparked
expectations
the
ecb
may
offer
clues
on
its
intentions
to
end
its
bond
purchases
by
the
end
of
year
at
its
upcoming
meeting
the
euro
traded
at
bouncing
back
from
hit
after
the
fed
s
policy
announcement
and
not
far
off
last
week
s
high
of
on
june
the
dollar
stood
at
yen
losing
steam
after
hitting
a
high
of
in
the
wake
of
the
fed
s
decision
the
dollar
index
has
erased
all
of
its
gains
so
far
this
week
and
stood
at
oil
prices
firmed
on
a
decline
in
crude
inventories
and
surprise
drawdowns
in
gasoline
and
distillates
which
indicated
strong
demand
in
the
world

unchanged
on
the
day

their
