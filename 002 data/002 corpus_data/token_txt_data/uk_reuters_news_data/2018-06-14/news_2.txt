at
the

strength
is
merely
a
catchup
process
to
the
higher
priced
products
and
brent
values
jim
ritterbusch
president
of

and
associates
said
in
a
note
brent
and
wti
hit
highs
in
may
but
have
since
drifted
lower
indicating
investors
expect
the
market
to
soon
become
better
supplied
as
crude
production
rises
and
as
opec
and
its
allies
look
poised
to
increase
output
the
dollar
gained
against
a
basket
of
currencies
approaching
the
high
it
hit
in

president
mario
draghi
came
out
a
little
bit
more
dovish
than
people
thought
he
was
going
to
be
and
that
really
caused
the
euro
to
take
a
dip
and
the
dollar
to
go
up
which
is
putting
downward
pressure
on
prices
said

in

a
stronger
dollar
makes
commodities
like
oil
more
expensive
for

of
other
currencies

have
also
weighed
