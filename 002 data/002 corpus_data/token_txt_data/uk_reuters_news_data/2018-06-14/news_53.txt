reuters
china
s
steel
output
surged
to
a
record
in
may
as
mills
ramped
up
production
to
chase
fat
profit
margins
with
a
strong
outlook
for
demand
likely
to
keep
mills
running
at
nearly
full
capacity
for
the
rest
of
the
year
the
increased
output
comes
despite
china
s
efforts
to
limit
production
in
key
areas
as
part
of
its
campaign
and

beijing

challenge

tackling

calculations
based
on
the
official
data
steel
mills
have
been
running
and
adding
scrap
steel
to
increase
output
in
order
to
cash
in
on
strong
margins
said

senior

futures
given
firm
demand
and
production
curbs
in
areas
including
the
key
steelmaking
hubs
of
hebei
and
jiangsu
provinces
analysts
say
mills
can
earn
up
to
yuan
by
producing
a
ton
of
steel
at
present
not
far
from
more
than
yuan
late
last
year
the
utilization
rate
at
steel
firms
across
the
country
was
above
percent
from
late
may
a
level
last
seen
before
winter
production
curbs
which
kicked
in
in
october
and
lasted
through
march
recent
environmental
inspections
in
some
regions
have
forced
some
mills
to
cut
production
but
analysts
do
not
expect
the
curbs
to
last
long
unless
new
environmental
policies
add
to
pressure
on
supplies
demand
from
downstream
sectors
may
be
better
than
expected
said
zhuo
the
market
generally
believes
the
infrastructure
construction
sector
is
more
active
in
the
second
half
than
in
the
first
half
which
could
lift
demand
for
steel
underlining

demand

china
s
output
has
been
increasing
despite
its
closure
of
million
tonnes
in
steel
production
capacity
in
the
past
two
years
including
illegal

that
is
part
of
beijing
s
vow
to
address
overcapacity
that
has
dogged
its
steel
sector
for
years
outside
china
chinese
steel
companies
have
built

acquired
million

of

and
are
building
an
additional
million

over
