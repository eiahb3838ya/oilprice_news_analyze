low on snow: norway's power prices soar as dry spring gulps down reservoirs
oslo
reuters
norway
europe
s
largest
hydropower
producer
faces
higher
energy
costs
this
summer
as
much
of
the
snow
accumulating
in
its
mountains
evaporated
or
melted
into
the
ground
during
a
shock
heat
wave
its
water
resources
and
energy
regulator
said
following
an
unusually
cold
winter
that
depleted
power
producers
reservoirs
more
than
usual
companies
had
relied
on
a
gradual
spring
melt
to
replenish
dams
but
projections
now
show
this
is
no
longer
feasible
the
nve
directorate
told
reuters
some
customers
may
not
be
happy
with
their
power
bill
in
but
that
is
the
cost
of
a
weather
dependent
power
system
in
wet
and
normal
years
power
prices
tend
to
be
lower
nve
adviser
martin
andreas
vik
said
with
about
percent
of
norway
s
energy
needs
covered
by
electricity
from
hydropower
the
expected
lower
reservoir
levels
drove
spot
power
prices
to
above
euros
per
megawatt
hour
on
average
this
week
double
from
to
early
june
temperatures
in
southern
norway
hit
records
for
that
time
of
the
year
exceeding
degrees
celsius
fahrenheit
and
leading
many
municipalities
to
ban
outdoor
barbecuing
to
prevent
fires
this
is
the
driest
period
ever
recorded
with
measurements
from
until
today
vik
said
as
projections
showed
more
snow
had
evaporated
or
melted
into
the
ground
than
had
flowed
into
reservoirs
the
melting
season
is
not
over
but
we
have
less
snow
left
in
norway
than
normal
vik
added
by
june
the
remaining
snow
that
had
yet
to
melt
in
mountain
regions
corresponded
to
an
estimated
future
power
output
of
terawatt
hours
as
opposed
to
twh
in
a
normal
year
he
said
by
june
norway
s
reservoirs
were
percent
full
still
higher
than
last
year
s
percent
but
with
much
less
snow
left
to
melt
it
was
only
rain
that
could
significantly
increase
it
last
year
reservoir
fillings
peaked
at
percent
in
late
october
in
the
peak
will
come
much
earlier
as
norway
has
so
far
received
twh
less
rain
and
snow
than
normal
equal
to
percent
in
reservoir
capacity
nve
said
while
the
cold
winter
and
subsequent
smaller
inflows
drove
norway
s
prices
higher
they
were
not
the
only
market
driver
vik
said
increasing
and
coal
prices
combined
with
low
wind
power
production
in
europe
made
norwegian
electricity
more
competitive
to
export
and
even
during
the
dry
period
norway
continued
to
supply
its
neighbors
through
interconnections
