returning

sea
having
sold
many
assets
in

few
years
often
to
private
equity
investors
after
oil
prices
collapsed
there
has
clearly
been
a
sentiment
change
in
the
north
sea
certainly
from
our
perspective
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
oil
price
is
up
costs
remain
low
and
it
s
a
really
exciting
window
of
opportunity
to
invest
in
the
north

said
on

that
it
expected
to
start
drilling
in
the
third
quarter
pending
regulatory
approval
first
oil
is
expected

plantain
which
have
estimated
combined
resources
of

equivalent
with
an

case
of

barrels
oil
equivalent

sea
and
plans
to
take
part
in
the
upcoming

licensing
round
terrell

the
company
was
open
to
a
possible
stock
market
listing
yes
that
s
certainly
a
possiblity
we
re
aggressively
growing
increasing
the
value
of
our
company
and
we
will
be
pursuing
a
range
of
sources
of
capital
seacrest
have
been
a
great
investor
for
us
and
will
continue
to
be
so
no
doubt
but
clearly
the
capital
markets
are
renewed
interest
in
north

assets
was
highlighted
last

when
