braunschweig
germany
reuters
volkswagen
could
face
additional
fines
in
munich
and
stuttgart
on
top
of
the
billion
euros
bln
it
has
been
told
to
pay
for
management
lapses
which
caused
emissions
cheating
on
million
vw
diesel
cars
prosecutors
in
the
german
town
of
braunschweig
used
a
administrative
order
to
fine
volkswagen
for
oversight
problems
which
allowed
millions
of
polluting
vw
cars
to
hit
the
road
the
fine
is
one
of
the
biggest
ever
penalties
imposed
by
german
authorities
against
a
company
it
deals
yet
another
blow
to
one
of
germany
s
big
industries
which
is
struggling
to
recover
from
the
fallout
from
the
emissions
cheating
scandal
that
broke
in
the
billion
euro
fine
is
not
included
in
the
billion
euros
billion
that
europe
s
biggest
carmaker
has
set
aside
to
cover
costs
related
to
its
admission
that
it
cheated
diesel
emissions
tests
and
it
will
hit
earnings
analysts
at
evercore
isi
said
but
shareholders
should
welcome
the
move
since
it
marks
an
end
to
some
of
the
criminal
proceedings
against
the
carmaker
they
added
however
that
is
not
the
end
of
vw
s
legal
problems
prosecutors
in
the
southern
city
of
munich
said
they
too
are
examining
whether
to
impose
similar
fines
on
vw
s
premium
division
audi
for
its
role
manipulating
and
cylinder
diesel
engines
that
would
be
in
addition
to
braunschweig
s
fine
which
sanctioned
violations
tied
to
diesel
engines
stuttgart
prosecutors
who
have
launched
a
probe
against
employees
at
daimler
porsche
which
is
another
part
of
the
volkswagen
group
and
auto
supplier
bosch
said
they
too
may
consider
the
use
of
an
administrative
order
in
all
these
proceedings
it
is
possible
that
a
regulatory
offense
procedure
will
be
carried
out
we
are
still
evaluating
this
possibility
a
spokesman
for
the
stuttgart
prosecutor
s
office
said
on
thursday
prosecutors
in
braunschweig
are
also
investigating
volkswagen
executives
including
chairman
hans
dieter
poetsch
and
chief
executive
herbert
diess
to
see
if
they
informed
investors
in
a
timely
fashion
about
the
scale
of
potential
fines
faced
by
the
carmaker
for
cheating
emissions
tests
the
company
denies
any
wrongdoing
by
its
executives
braunschweig
said
it
may
rule
on
the
matter
in
the
coming
months
the
town
is
the
main
legal
jurisdiction
covering
vw
s
headquarters
in
the
german
town
of
wolfsburg
on
market
manipulation
it
is
possible
that
there
will
be
a
decision
this
year
a
decision
does
not
necessarily
mean
bringing
charges
it
could
mean
closing
the
proceedings
braunschweig
prosecutor
klaus
ziehe
said
at
a
news
conference
in
a
filing
submitted
to
a
braunschweig
court
on
volkswagen
argued
it
did
not
violate
corporate
disclosure
rules
because
it
did
not
understand
the
scope
of
potential
fines
and
claims
faced
by
the
company
four
days
before
regulators
blew
the
whistle
on
volkswagen
poetsch
the
company
s
chief
financial
officer
at
the
time
saw
the
potential
financial
risk
from
emissions
violations
at
million
euros
the
court
filing
shows
authorities
disclosed
volkswagen
s
systematic
emissions
cheating
on
sparking
the
biggest
business
scandal
in
the
company
s
history
and
triggering
a
crackdown
on
emissions
across
the
industry
volkswagen
shares
were
up
percent
by

outperforming
the
