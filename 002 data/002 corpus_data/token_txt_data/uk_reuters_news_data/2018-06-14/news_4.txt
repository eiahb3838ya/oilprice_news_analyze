the
dollar
rose
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
by
more
than
a
penny
as
the

cratered
and

ticked
up

now
plans
to
reduce

to

then

investors
though
seized
on
comments
indicating
that
interest
rates
would
stay
at
record
lows
at

through
the
summer
of

some
analysts
believed
it
may
be
longer
with
draghi

term
of
office
due
to
expire
at
the
end
of
october
we
feel
the
ecb
is
unlikely
to
start
increasing
interest
rates
until
the
new
ecb

is
firmly
in
place

one
issue
keeping
