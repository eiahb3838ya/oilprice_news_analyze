wildhorse

opening
a
new

in

the
application

drew

wildhorse
s

chief
said
in
an
interview
after
shale
producers
pushed
oil
and
gas
output
to
highs
some
are
now
taking
what
they
have
learned
to
fields
that
until
recently
were
considered
played
out
if
they
are
successful
the
energy
boom
could
find
another
gear
as
producers
find
profitable
ways
to
extract
the
billions
of
barrels
of
oil
remaining
in
older
fields
production
from
the
austin
chalk
jumped
to
barrels
per

bpd
last
year
from
bpd
five

and
up
percent
from

previous

according
to

mackenzie
which
expects
rapid
production
gains
to
continue
the
number
of

in

other
plays
getting
fresh
attention
include
the
meramec

and

in

devon
energy
corp
is
one
of
the
biggest
producers
in
the
meramec
where
it
plans
to
boost
output
to
bpd
by
the
end
of
the
year
from
bpd
at
the
end
of
in
the
central
basin
platform
in
the
permian
oilfield
smaller
producers
such
as
ring
energy
inc
have
begun
investing
heavily
hoping
to
rejuvenate
an
area
that
first
produced
nearly
a
century
ago
there
is
no
publicly
available
data
on
meramec
and
central
basin
s
total
production
many
of
the
tools
developed
to
unlock
vast
shale
reserves
are
working
in
these
different
geological
settings
including
longer
wells
steerable
drilling
technology
complex
mixtures
of
sand
and
chemicals
and
the
hydraulic
fracturing
of
bedrock
these
fringe
areas
like
the
austin
chalk
could
be
the
next
big
thing
said
bernadette
johnson
of
drillinginfo
more
oil
from
austin
chalk
and
other
similar
fields
could
push
production
to
fresh
records
shale
producers
have
for
several
consecutive
years
outstripped
government
forecasts
taking
output
to
a
record
million
bpd
in
march
even
without
innovations
such
as
those
under
way
in
the
austin
chalk
the
government
predicts
nearly
million
bpd
by
late
next
year
this
is
something
that
people
haven
t
baked
into
the
supply
side
yet
said
jeremy
gottlieb
who
has
helped
finance
companies
bringing
shale
technology
to
inexpensive
older
fields
this
is
going
to
take
people
by
wildcatters
first
pumped
oil
from
the
austin
chalk
nearly
a
century
ago
but
output
reached
its
peak
in
the
early
even
though
the
formation
still
contains
about
a
billion
barrels
of
crude
according
to
government
s
geological
survey
that
is
not
unusual
oil
producers
have
historically
extracted
less
than
half
the
oil
from
any
particular
field
because
the
rest
has
not
been
accessible
at
a
profit
that
is
changing
in
fields
like
the
austin
chalk
based
on
test
wells
and
modelling
techniques
conoco
believes
long
horizontal
wells
with
multiple
fracks
a
technique
used
often
in
shale
fields
will
deliver
strong
results
from
its
acreage
in
the
austin
chalk
what
we
were
seeing
with
some
of
the
newer
technologies
work
really
well
in
the
austin
chalk
conoco
chief
executive
ryan
lance
told
reuters
some
wells
they
have
fracked
in
the
austin
chalk
have
produced
more
prolifically
than
shale
wells
wildhorse
s
newer
austin
chalk
wells
produced
more
than
three
times
the
initial
output
of
wells
at
the
eagle
ford
shale
field
the
company
said
this
month
eog
also
said
an
austin
chalk
well
it
drilled
this
year
in
texas
produced
nearly
bpd
in
its
first
month
more
than
twice
the
first
month
rate
of
a
shale
well
it
had
completed
in
the
permian
during
the
same
period
the
field
s
proximity
to
gulf
coast
refiners
and
export
ports
make
it
that
much
more
attractive
she
said
rising
oil
prices
have
also
increase
the
number
of
potentially
profitable
plays
some
portions
of
the
austin
chalk
also
sit
on
top
of
the
eagle
ford
shale
field
allowing
drillers
to
potential
extract
oil
from
multiple
layers
and
types
of
rock
it
s
a
stacked
play
said
johnson
of
drillinginfo
land
is
still
cheap
in
the
formation
which
has
helped
lure
more
producers
conoco
leased
its
land
for
less
than
an
acre
that
compares
with
as
much
as
an
acre
in
the
permian
basin
in
west
texas
and
new
mexico
the
centre
of
shale
drilling
and
its
largest
oilfield
about
austin
chalk
drilling
permits
were
approved
in
the
last
months
a
nearly
increase
from
the
previous
period
according
to
drillinginfo
analysts
say
they
expect
more
activity
to
spread
to
the
louisiana
portion
of
the
play
there
are
austin
chalk
horizontal
wells
in
texas
but
only
in
louisiana
according
to
wood
mackenzie
louisiana
is
counting
on
the
austin
chalk
developments
to
revive
the
state
s
declining
oil
output
which
fell
percent
last
year
to
million
barrels
the
lowest
level
since
that
might
stop
the
drain
of
oil
workers
to
texas
said
gifford
briggs
head
of
the
louisiana
oil
and
gas
association
an
industry
trade
group
oil
industry
employment
in
the
state
fell
percent
in
the
past
year
despite
a
rise
in
commodity
prices
largely
due
to
workers
leaving
to
develop
texas
shale
fields
according
to
government
data
it
s
an
opportunity
for
some
of
our
workers
to
stay
in
state
