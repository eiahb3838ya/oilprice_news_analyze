japan to join eu in wto talks on u.s. steel tariffs - source
tokyo
reuters
japan
is
seeking
to
join
the
european
union
in
its
push
to
set
up
dispute
resolution
talks
with
the
united
states
over
washington
s
steel
and
aluminium
tariffs
under
the
world
trade
organisation
framework
a
government
source
said
the
japanese
government
source
who
has
direct
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
it
has
informed
the
wto
about
its
intention
to
take
part
the
source
who
did
not
want
to
be
named
also
said
japan
has
told
the
wto
it
wants
to
participate
in
similar
consultations
requested
by
canada
and
mexico
as
it
looks
to
join
forces
with
countries
affected
by
tariffs
we
are
in
the
same
situation
as
the
other
countries
so
we
want
to
participate
in
the
talks
and
share
information
said
the
source
our
ultimate
goal
is
to
get
the
to
repeal
these
holding
consultations
is
the
first
step
in
the
wto
s
dispute
settlement
process
but
it
is
uncertain
whether
the
united
states
will
agree
to
the
request
for
talks
the
united
states
has
upset
its
closest
allies
by
imposing
a
percent
tariff
on
steel
imports
and
percent
tariff
on
aluminium
imports
the
says
the
tariffs
are
needed
to
protect
national
security
and
workers
many
countries
say
their
steel
exports
pose
no
threat
to
national
security
and
the
tariffs
are
really
aimed
at
curbing
china
s
excess
steel
capacity
disagreement
over
the
tariffs
spilled
into
the
open
at
a
group
of
seven
leaders
summit
last
week
as
president
donald
trump
backed
out
of
signing
a
joint
communique
that
appeared
to
reach
a
fragile
consensus
on
trade
policy
the
eu
canada
and
mexico
have
prepared
retaliatory
tariffs
against
imports
raising
the
chance
of
a
trade
war
so
far
japan
has
not
taken
similar
steps
but
there
is
lingering
concern
in
tokyo
over
whether
washington
will
try
to
curb
japanese
imports
to
lower
the
trade
deficit
