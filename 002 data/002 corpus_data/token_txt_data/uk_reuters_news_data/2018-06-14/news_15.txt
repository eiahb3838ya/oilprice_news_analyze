european
stocks
jumped
more
than
percent
on
thursday
while
the
euro
cratered
against
the
dollar
after
the
european
central
bank
indicated
it
would
not
raise
interest
rates
through
the
summer
of
the
bank
s
unexpectedly
dovish
guidance
on
interest
rates
overshadowed
its
statement
that
it
aimed
to
wrap
up
its
stimulus
programme
quantitative
easing
at
the
end
of
this
year
the
ecb
now
plans
to
reduce
monthly
asset
purchases
between
october
and
december
to
billion
euros
until
the
end
of
and
then
conclude
the
programme
though
ecb
president
mario
draghi
stressed
that
the
governing
council
stood
ready
to
adjust
all
its
instruments
as
investors
though
seized
on
comments
indicating
that
interest
rates
would
stay
at
record
lows
at
least
through
the
summer
of
some
analysts
believe
it
could
be
even
longer
with
draghi
s
term
of
office
due
to
expire
at
the
end
of
october
we
feel
the
ecb
is
unlikely
to
start
increasing
interest
rates
until
the
new
ecb
president
is
firmly
in
place

given
the
clear
guidance

it

priced
out

one
issue
keeping

in
check
was
concern
about

chinese
goods

trump
was
planning
to
meet
with
trade
advisers

tariffs
a

said
on
wednesday
cbot
corn
