june
reuters
the
european
union
is
seeking
a
date
in
early
july
to
mediate
talks
between
russia
and
ukraine
over
future
gas
transit
to
europe
once
their
contract
expires
in
the
eu
s
energy
chief
told
reuters
on
thursday
russia
s
expansion
of
the
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
directly
to
germany
and
the
construction
of
the
new
turkstream
pipeline
to
turkey
has
raised
doubts
about
continued
gas
flows
through
ukraine
the
traditional
route
for
supplies
to
europe
eu
leaders
worry
the
new
routes
will
allow
russian
export
monopoly
gazprom
which
supplies
over
a
quarter
of
the
bloc
s
gas
needs
to
cut
volumes
via
ukraine
depriving
the
struggling
economy
of
valuable
transit
fees
this
is
a
priority
on
which
we
have
a
european
consensus
european
commission
vice
president
maros
sefcovic
said
we
have
a
percent
consensus
that
the
gas
transits
should
be
maintained
in
the
post
he
highlighted
germany
s
support
and
what
he
said
was
its
acknowldgement
that
the
issue
had
polarised
the
bloc
after
eastern
european
member
states
opposed
the
nord
stream
pipeline
of
which
berlin
is
the
main
beneficiary
sefcovic
said
he
wanted
talks
to
bring
together
political
and
company
representatives
from
both
russian
and
ukraine
as
well
as
diplomats
from
france
and
germany
i
hope
that
we
can
start
working
out
how
we
are
going
to
go
through
these
very
complex
issues
he
said
if
we
solve
this
politically
very
sensitive
issue
then
it
would
help
us
to
solve
other
crucial
issues
for
europe
but
also
for
ukraine
s
nagftogaz
is
seeking
firm
guarantees
on
future
transits
and
sefcovic
said
clarity
over
future
pipeline
operations
were
crucial
for
securing
european
investment
to
modernise
the
country
s
gas
transit
system
the
best
guarantee
would
be
the
bookings
and
commercially
viable
volumes
