june
reuters
argentina
will
begin
exporting
natural
gas
to
neighboring
chile
before
the
end
of
the
year
the
energy
ministers
of
both
countries
said
on
thursday
as
output
from
the
vaca
muerta
shale
field
rises
the
two
south
american
countries
had
previously
signed
deals
allowing
for
the
export
of
gas
or
electricity
in
emergency
situations
but
required
that
an
equivalent
amount
be
within
twelve
months
chilean
companies
are
in
talks
to
sign
import
deals
and
the
first
flow
of
gas
across
the
andes
could
come
in
october
or
november
of
this
year
chile
energy
minister
susana
jimenez
said
in
an
interview
in
bariloche
argentina
at
the
meeting
of
energy
ministers
we
see
a
great
opportunity
for
mutual
benefit
she
said
adding
that
the
gas
could
come
both
from
the
neuquen
basin
home
to
vaca
muerta
and
from
the
austral
basin
in
southern
argentina
the
gas
could
be
used
for
electricity
generation
replacing
imports
from
elsewhere
or
to
heat
homes
in
areas
where
families
still
depend
on
wood
a
source
of
pollution
in
the
region
jimenez
said
chile
produces
little
hydrocarbons
of
its
own
the
unrestricted
exports
would
mark
a
turning
point
in
energy
trade
in
the
region
argentina
was
once
a
major
supplier
of
natural
gas
to
chile
but
triggered
a
diplomatic
crisis
in
the
by
cutting
off
shipments
when
its
own
supplies
ran
low
argentina
sits
atop
the
world
s
no
shale
gas
reserves
but
is
still
a
net
energy
importer
since
taking
office
in
december
president
mauricio
macri
has
sought
to
loosen
labor
rules
and
boost
infrastructure
to
attract
investment
rising
output
from
vaca
muerta
could
help
the
country
export
more
than
it
imports
by
argentina
s
energy
minister
juan
jose
aranguren
said
at
a
news
conference
the
country
is
set
to
import
slightly
more
than
cargoes
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
this
year
down
from
last
year
and
in
argentina
still
needs
the
lng
imports
to
meet
peak
winter
demand
but
in
the
southern
hemisphere
summer
months
it
could
see
a
surplus
aranguren
said
this
summer
we
will
start
to
sign
permits
for
exporting
natural
gas
to
chile
without
any
restrictions
