gloves back on, opec and u.s. shale producers to deepen ties in vienna
houston
reuters
only
a
few
years
ago
shale
ceos
and
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
were
in
open
conflict
now
they
realise
they
re
in
the
same
boat
and
need
to
row
in
tandem
to
keep
global
crude
supply
and
demand
in
balance
according
to
interviews
with
analysts
executives
and
investors
the
recent
rise
in
crude
prices
up
more
than
percent
in
the
past
year
has
lifted
profits
for
producers
across
the
globe
but
also
threatens
to
erode
demand
for
fossil
fuels
at
a
time
when
electrification
is
becoming
commonplace
we
re
getting
to
a
point
where
a
continued
rise
in
the
oil
price
is
going
to
cause
major
problems
for
the
global
economy
said
amy
meyers
jaffe
director
of
the
programme
on
energy
security
and
climate
change
at
the
council
on
foreign
relations
there
are
bigger
issues
at
hand
besides
output
that
opec
and
shale
producers
care
opec
and
representatives
have
met
at
least
twice
this
year
with
a
third
meeting
set
for
vienna
next
week
finding
the
optimal
balance
of
crude
supply
and
demand
will
be
the
hot
topic
harold
hamm

due
to
address
opec

ahead
of
the
meeting
sheffield
declined
to
comment
i
wouldn
t
take
dialogue
and
discussion
as
any
kind
of
collaboration
we
re
all
talking
about
what
does
world
demand
look
like
for
oil
said
senator
heidi
heitkamp
a
north
dakota
democrat
who
successfully
pushed
to
lift
the
oil
export
ban
in
lifting
that
ban
ushered
in
a
sea
change
in
global
energy
sending
nearly
million
barrels
of
crude
to
india
china
and
other
markets
historically
dominated
by
opec
and
forcing
the
group
and
its
american
rivals
to
be
more
conciliatory
hamm
who
called
opec
a
toothless
tiger
in
has
begun
encouraging
fellow
shale
companies
to
focus
more
on
profitability
and
less
on
profligate
production
last
month
hamm
addressed
a
saudi
aramco
board
meeting
in
houston
it
was
a
change
in
tone
for
hamm
who
in
erected
a
granite
monument
on
the
windswept
plains
of
north
dakota
that
boasted
of
the
rising
clout
of
oil
production
and
the
nation
s
ability
to
supply
its
own
energy
the
monument
to
one
of
the
first
horizontal
shale
wells
drilled
in
the
united
states
bragged
that
continental
had
helped
dispel
the
myth
that
america
was
running
out
of
oil
and
would
help
the
country
beat
global
competitors
khalid
chairman
of
state
oil
giant
aramco
and
the
saudi
energy
minister
will
be
in
vienna
along
with
fellow
opec
ministers
to
debate
whether
to
extend
recent
production
curbs
shale
executives
will
not
be
part
of
those
discussions
but
will
meet
elsewhere
in
vienna
during
the
week
with
falih
and
other
opec
ministers
shale
producers
are
prohibited
by
antitrust
law
from
coordinating
their
output
making
their
desire
with
opec
to
curb
volatility
and
price
spikes
a
difficult
one
oil
and
gas
producers
need
stable
oil
prices
to
be
successful
not
necessarily
higher
oil
prices
said
rob
thummel
portfolio
manager
of
tortoise
energy
independence
fund
which
holds
shares
of
pioneer
and
other

indeed
some
executives
are
staying
away
from
vienna
mark
papa
the
ceo
of
centennial
resource
development
inc
and
ryan
lance
ceo
of
conocophillips
had
been
slated
to
attend
but
backed
out
lance
had
been
due
to
speak
on
a
panel
with
several
persian
gulf
producers
but
grew
concerned
that
it
would
seem
as
if
he
were
the
designate
representative
at
such
a
forum
according
to
a
source
familiar
with
the
company
s
thinking
conoco
declined
to
comment
papa
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
opec
ministers
are
expected
to
question
the
shale
executives
about
rising
output
from
the
permian
basin
of
west
texas
and
new
mexico
the
largest
oilfield
which
pumps
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
there
is
a
tsunami
of
oil
coming
from
the
permian
said
pete
bowden
global
head
of
energy
investment
banking
at
jefferies
that
is
a
not
just
for
the
industry
domestically
but
for
international
oil
and
gas
with
crude
exports
at
a
record
high
rising
permian
production
has
become
more
of
a
concern
for
opec
than
at
any
time
in
history
we
expect
that
they
shale
producers
remain
independent
and
do
what
s
in
the
best
interest
of
their
country
senator
heitkamp
said
we
re
not
going
to
join
opec
and
we
re
going
to
be
fiercely
competing
with
that
competition
though
increasingly
includes
a
realization
that
the
fate
of
both
sides
is
tied
consumers
will
move
to
electric
cars
if
the
oil
price
spikes
