eu agrees 32 pct renewables target for 2030
brussels
reuters
eu
negotiators
agreed
on
thursday
to
increase
the
share
of
renewables
in
the
bloc
s
energy
production
to
percent
by
a
higher
target
than
in
draft
rules
but
short
of
the
level
sought
by
some
governments
and
the
european
parliament
the
final
european
union
law
calls
for
a
phasing
out
of
the
use
of
palm
oil
a
major
import
from
southeast
asia
by
and
removes
some
barriers
to
small
producers
of
renewable
energy
the
measures
are
aimed
at
helping
the
european
union
meet
its
overall
goal
of
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
at
least
percent
below
levels
by
following
the
paris
agreement
to
keep
global
warming
well
below
degrees
this
deal
is
a
victory
in
our
efforts
to
unlock
the
true
potential
of
europe
s
clean
energy
transition
eu
climate
commissioner
miguel
arias
canete
said
on
twitter
the
eu
executive
had
initially
proposed
a
target
of
percent
a
compromise
backed
by
member
states
but
at
a
meeting
of
energy
minister
on
monday
a
group
of
eu
leaders
had
pushed
for
a
higher
goal
one
rejected
by
germany
s
peter
altmaier
as
unachievable
thursday
s
agreement
allows
for
a
review
for
an
upward
revision
of
the
eu
level
target
until
the
european
union
is
targeting
a
percent
share
of
renewables
and
experts
have
pointed
out
that
the
sharp
fall
in
the
cost
of
renewables
would
allow
for
higher
targets
without
increasing
budgets
the
agreed
binding
target
of
percent
should
be
seen
as
a
starting
line
for
the
race
to
greater
ambition
said
wendel
trio
director
of
campaign
group
climate
action
network
europe
while
crucial
in
the
quest
to
reduce
carbon
emissions
some
eu
countries
have
been
reluctant
to
back
too
high
a
target
as
their
electricity
production
is
still
largely
dependent
technologies
such
as
coal
and
gas
