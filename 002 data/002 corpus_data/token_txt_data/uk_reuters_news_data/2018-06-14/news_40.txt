the
euro
rose
to
its
highest
in
a
month
but
world
stocks
wilted
on
thursday
as
the
european
central
bank
prepared
to
pull
the
plug
on
its
stimulus
programme
after
the
federal
reserve
raised
interest
rates
for
the
second
time
this
year
and
hinted
at
two
more
it
was
shaping
up
to
be
a
for
risk
assets
that
have
risen
sharply
in
value
during
years
of
borrowing
all
sectors
on
the
stoxx
index
were
in
negative
territory
basic

led

with
a

after

from

china
the
dollar
had
popped
higher
after
the
fed
s
move
but
faded
in
asia
and
was
still
falling
as
the
euro
pushed
above
before
the
ecb
decision

zone
government
bond
yields
also
edged
up
with
germany
s
bunds
offering
percent
versus
the
percent
from
treasuries
which
had
briefly
topped
percent
overnight
i
think
its
pragmatic
for
the
fed
to
take
these
moves
because
if
you
are
not
going
to
make
them
now
when
are
you
going
to
take
them
kully
samra
european
managing
director
at
trillion
asset
manager
charles
schwab
said
the
ecb
had
probably
been
too
slow
to
reduce
stimulus
samra
added
though
recent
weaker
data
showed
europe
still
had
underlying
issues
also
keeping
investors
in
check
were
concern
about
threats
to
impose
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
president
donald
trump
will
meet
with
his
trade
advisers
later
to
decide
whether
to
activate
the
tariffs
a
senior
administration
official
said
on
wednesday
in
asia
surprisingly
soft
chinese
retail
sales
and
investment
data
had
hit
sentiment
too
china
s
central
bank
then
left
its
interest
rates
on
hold
rather
than
follow
the
fed
as
it
sometimes
does
msci

in

taiwan
fell
over
and

japan
s
nikkei
dropped
percent
while
mainland
china
s
shanghai
composite
index
hit
a
closing
low
any
changes
to
the
ecb
s
programme
should
appear
in
a
statement
due
at
gmt
the
bank
s
chief
mario
draghi
then
holds
a
news
conference
at
gmt
the
biggest
complication
might
be
the
increasingly
murky
economic
european
outlook
the
continent
faces
a
developing
trade
war
with
the
united
states
a
populist
challenge
from
italy
s
new
government
and
softening
export
demand
it
would
be
wise
for
the
ecb
to
lay
out
policy
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
so
any
unexpected
events
over
the
summer
for
instance
from
italy
don
t
interfere
with
its
plans
kbc
interest
rate
strategist
mathias
van
der
jeugt
said
another
event
markets
were
gearing
up
for
was
the
start
of
soccer
s
world
cup
in
russia
russia
s
timezones
mean
there
will
be
more
matches
during
european
or
and
latin
american
trading
hours
than
any
previous
tournament
a
study
done
during
the
last
one
with
similarly
timed
games
the
finals
in
south
africa
showed
trading
volumes
on
share
markets
dropped
by
a
third
on
average
when
matches
were
on
and
percent
when
a
market
s
own
team
played
retail
sales
figures
were
also
due
too
s
p
and
dow
jones
and
nasdaq
futures
all
pointed
to
subdued
restart
later
the
dollar
stood
at
yen
after
falling
from
a
high
of
following
the
fed
s
decision
the
dollar
index
which
tracks
it
again
six
top
currencies
was
down
percent
having
erased
all
of
its
week
s
gains
the
australian
dollar
fell
percent
to
after
china
s
poor
economic
data
but
the
yuan
showed
little
reaction
especially
after
the
pboc
opted
not
to
raise
its
rates
there
is
no
urgency
for
china
to
maintain
its
favourable
yield
differential
against
the
united
states
as
capital
outflow
and
currency
stability
is
no
longer
the
key
concern
for
china
at
the
moment
said
tommy
xie
an
economist
at
ocbc
bank
with
trade
war
looming
a
slightly
weaker
yuan
may
be
in
china
s
some
emerging
market
currencies
have
been
hit
hard
by
worries
higher
interest
rates
could
prompt
investors
to
shift
funds
to
the
united
states
the
dip
in
the
dollar
on
thursday
brought
welcome
relief
south
africa
s
rand
rebounded
from
a
low
the
turkish
lira
pulled
out
of
a
dive
and
the
mexican
peso
recovered
from
a
low
among
commodities
industrial
metals
sagged
but
gold
and
other
precious
metals
made
ground
oil
prices
were
little
changed
underpinned
by
a
decline
in
crude
inventories
and
surprise
drawdowns
in
gasoline
and
distillates
which
indicated
strong
demand
in
the
world
s
top
oil
consumer
brent
and
crude
futures
traded
at
and
a
barrel
respectively
to
extend
their
recovery
from
lows
touched
last
