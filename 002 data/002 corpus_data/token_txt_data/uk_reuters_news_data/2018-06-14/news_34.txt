discussion
in
the
crude
oil
market
is
degenerating
into
a
single
will
they
or
won
t
they
focus
on
whether
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
will
ease
their
output
restrictions
next
week
while
the
meeting
in
vienna
on
june
will
undoubtedly
heavily
influence
the
direction
of
crude
prices
the
market
s
focus
solely
on
supply
could
be
viewed
as
somewhat
myopic
demand
is
probably
the
more
important
driver
of
the
oil
price
over
the
longer
term
and
the
simple
truth
is
that
the
global
market
is
effectively
now
hostage
to
just
two
countries
china
and
india
have
so
far
this
year
accounted
for
about
percent
of
the
expected
growth
in
crude
oil
demand
meaning
that
what
happens
in
those
two
behemoths
is
likely
of
far
more
importance
to
the
crude
market
than
what
may
or
may
not
happen
in
vienna
the
international
energy
agency
forecast
last
month
that
global
crude
oil
demand
would
rise
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
down
from
an
earlier
estimate
of
million
bpd
for
the
first
five
months
of
the
year
china
s
crude
oil
imports
were
million
bpd
according
to
customs
data
a
rise
of
bpd
on
the
same
period
in
india
s
crude
imports
were
million
bpd
in
the
period
up
bpd
from
the
same
period
last
year
according
to
vessel
and
port
data
and
industry
sources
together
these
two
countries
the
world
s
biggest
and
crude
importers
have
brought
in
bpd
more
in
the
first
five
months
of
than
in
same
period
last
year
if
this
pace
of
growth
was
maintained
for
the
whole
year
it
would
mean
that
china
and
india
would
account
for
the
lion
s
share
of
the
iea
s
forecast
for
the
increase
in
global
demand
most
investors
or
companies
would
tell
you
that
having
more
than
of
your
expected
growth
exposed
to
just
two
players
is
extremely
risky
yet
the
oil
market
seems
almost
blase
about
the
outlook
for
both
these
countries
while
the
majority
of
economic
forecasts
are
for
strong
outcomes
in
both
china
and
india
they
aren
t
without
risks
and
those
risks
may
be
rising
for
china
there
is
the
perennial
threat
of
credit
problems
with
several
parts
of
the
economy
still
highly
leveraged
and
struggling
to
service
loans
there
is
also
the
rising
risk
of
an
escalation
of
trade
tensions
and
a
tariff
war
with
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
and
then
there
is
the
government
s
policy
of
reducing
air
pollution
which
is
resulting
in
a
shift
to
electric
cars
and
trucks
powered
by
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
for
india
the
greatest
risk
to
its
economic
outlook
is
high
energy
prices
given
its
reliance
on
imported
crude
and
natural
gas
and
to
some
extent
imported
coal
the
price
of
a
litre
of
diesel
in
the
capital
new
delhi
was
indian
rupees
on
wednesday
which
is
up
percent
from
this
time
a
year
ago
the
price
of
brent
crude
has
risen
by
about
percent
in
the
past
year
meaning
indian
consumers
have
been
spared
the
worst
of
the
increase
but
there
have
to
be
question
marks
over
how
long
the
government
can
lean
on
the
refiners
to
absorb
the
cost
increase
overall
there
is
no
immediate
reason
to
expect
lower
crude
oil
demand
growth
in
china
and
india
but
the
risks
are
mainly
angled
toward
an
easing
rather
than
an
acceleration
