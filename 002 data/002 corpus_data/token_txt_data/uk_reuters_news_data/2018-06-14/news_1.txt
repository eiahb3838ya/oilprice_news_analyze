potential cushing bottleneck could increase u.s. oil discount
new

june
reuters
as
the
discount
of
crude
to
global
benchmark
brent
nears
highs
an
emerging
bottleneck
at
the
key
storage
hub
in
cushing
oklahoma
is
making
futures
vulnerable
to
a
drop
traders
and
analysts
said
infrastructure
constraints
in
the
permian
basin
have
already
kept
oil
prices
below
international
grades
now
new
constraints
threaten
to
depress
them
even
further
and
widen
the
gap
between
west
texas
intermediate
crude
wti
and
global
benchmark
brent
pipelines
are
overwhelmed
as
crude
production
continues
to
hit
new
highs
the
bulk
of
the
record
million
barrels
per
day
produced
last
week
came
from
the
permian
basin
of
west
texas
and
new
mexico
permian
barrels
typically
go
to
the
gulf
coast
for
refining
or
export
but
those
pipelines
are
full
more
oil
has
thus
started
to
flow
to
the
storage
hub
of
cushing
where
futures
are
priced
as
a
result
northbound
pipes
too
are
nearing
capacity
cushing
inventories
may
therefore
start
to
rise
which
if
it
happens
could
further
widen
the
difference
between
wti
and
brent
wti
is
down
percent
from
its
high
while
brent
slipped
about
percent
from
its
peak
on
thursday
wti
traded
as
much
as
below
brent
earlier
this
month
the
discount
was
as
much
as
its
deepest
since
march

said
it
expects
a
spread
of
per

by
the
end
of

the
production
growth
in
the
is
just
going
to
continue
to
overwhelm

so
far
the
cushing
builds
have
not
come
as
midwest

process
record
amounts
of

to

last

fell

according
to

pipeline
utilization
from

to

was
about

data
from

intelligence
firm
genscape
showed
compared
with
about
percent
and
percent
in
april
and
may
respectively
canada
which
produces
heavy
crude
is
also
ramping
up
production
as
refiners
are
in
search
for
a
similar

said
in
a
note
these
heavier
canadian
barrels
are
being
prioritized
over
abundant
light
shale
on
cushing
pipelines
the
bottlenecks
will
likely
remain
until
the
end
of
or
early
when
about
million
bpd
of
pipeline
capacity
is
added
