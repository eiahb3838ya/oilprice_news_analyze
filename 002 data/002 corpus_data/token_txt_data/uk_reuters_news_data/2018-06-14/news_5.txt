many
top
shale
oil
producers
are
missing
out
on
the
rally
in
oil
prices
to
more
than
a
barrel
because
they
sold
their
oil
through
futures
contracts
at
about
last
year
when
that
looked
like
a
good
deal
now
it
looks
cheap
those
hedged
bets
will
hold
down
revenues
and
further
frustrate
wall
street
investors
who
have
been
disappointed
by
slow
returns
from
the
booming
permian
basin
in
west
texas
the
top
shale
producers
will
forego
about
billion
in
combined
revenues
in
the
second
quarter
with
oil
prices
at
about
according
to
consultancy
petronerds
many
of
those
producers
used
hedges
that
guaranteed
them
between
and
a
barrel
some
west
texas
producers
face
a
second
dynamic
they
are
forced
to
cut
prices
because
the
region
s
production
is
overwhelming
its
pipeline
network
raising
transportation
costs
west
texas
oil
currently
trades
at
a
discount
of
to
benchmark
futures
a
spread
that
hit
earlier
in
the
month
some
firms
earlier
protected
themselves
from
the
widening
gap
with
hedges
against
the
discount
but
those
that
didn
t
and
also
hedged
against
future
prices
at
for
instance
at
have
been
forced
to
sell
barrels
at
prices
in
the
many
firms
sold
their
future
output
at
prices
in
the
last
year
hoping
to
take
advantage
of
rallies
to
lock
in
guaranteed
income
to
cover
drilling
and
production
costs
those
costs
can
be
a
barrel
or
less
in
west
texas
allowing
the
firms
a
healthy
profit
even
as
they
protected
themselves
against
future
price
slumps
but
the
cost
of
that
protection
is
to
forego
the
potential
upside
of
higher
prices
the
second
problem
with
pipeline
capacity
stems
from
surprisingly
quick
production
growth
that
has
pushed
pipeline
capacity
to
the
limit
several
months
before
producers
expected
said
michael
tran
global
energy
strategist
at
rbc
capital
markets
producers
in
west
texas
the
nation
s
largest
oilfield
are
now
pumping
more
than
million
bpd
compared
with
million
bpd
a
year
ago
with
storage
brimming
and
pipelines
full
producers
have
had
to
offer
steep
discounts
to
compensate
for
rising
transport
costs
the
large
gap
between
the
futures
price
and
permian
basin
oil
is
called
the
midland
differential
named
for
the
town
at
the
center
of
the
west
texas
oilfield
boom
until
recently
firms
had
not
hedged
the
discount
because
the
price
of
midland
oil
and
futures
have
historically
tracked
closely
together
the
market
for
such
hedging
is
also
less
active
compared
with
futures
hedging
but
at
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
shale
companies
had
hedged
against
million
barrels
of
s
production
in
west
texas
compared
with
just
million
barrels
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
quarter
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of
regulatory
filings
it
s
really
becoming
a
more
widely
used
phenomenon
said
ben
montalbano
petronerds
who
said
midland
hedging
volume
has
increased
tenfold
in
the
last
two
years
coming
into
this
year
cimarex
energy
co
had
hedged
about
barrels
of
west
texas
production
at
a
discount
to
benchmark
futures
that
means
if
oil
futures
trade
at
a
barrel
cimarex
would
sell
oil
at
as
opposed
to
companies
that
didn
t
hedge
and
are
exposed
to
the
entire
midland
discount
now
at
in
the
first
quarter
cimarex
increased
its
hedge
against
the
differential
to
million
barrels
according
to
the
firm
s
filings
about
half
of
that
however
was
hedged
at
a
less
favorable
discount
of
per
barrel
effectively
selling
oil
at
if
futures
are
at
cimarex
produced
about
bpd
in
the
permian
in
the
first
quarter
the
company
did
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
with
major
pipelines
not
expected
to
come
online
until
next
year
and
production
increasing
analysts
expect
the
midland
differential
to
remain
high
occidental
petroleum
in
a
recent
presentation
said
it
expects
this
gap
to
hit
a
barrel
by
the
third
quarter
for
the
first
time
in
three
years
we
have
not
had
a
pipeline
to
come
on
to
alleviate
the
bottleneck
said
tran
some
firms
including
apache
corp
and
pioneer
natural
resources
said
they
don
t
have
to
worry
about
the
differential
because
they
have
reserved
enough
space
on
pipelines
to
transport
their
oil
apache
said
it
has
started
to
hedge
its
midland
exposure
for
pioneer
does
not
have
any
such
positions
said
rich

cfo
pioneer
has
firm
transportation
in
place
over
the
next
few
years
to
move
nearly
all
of
its

to

gulf
coast
for
export
or
