rpt-u.s. energy firms chasing oil price rally stumble on old baggage

with
oil
price
recovery
taking
hold
several
oil
and
gas
companies
entered
with
a
compelling
plan
sell
undeveloped
or
less
essential
fields
and
invest
the
money
to
boost
returns
from
their
sweetest
most
productive
spots
there
is
a
catch
though
the
strategy
assumes
that
with
crude
now
up
more
than
percent
from
its
february
bottom
enough
firms
are
keen
to
crank
up
production
even
if
it
means
buying
fields
with
higher
extraction
costs
and
lower
margins
so
far
sale
attempts
suggest
those
buyers
may
be
hard
to
come
by
after
a
bruising
downturn
shareholders
are
looking
to
get
a
cut
of
improved
profits
and
asset
sale
proceeds
rather
than
underwrite
acquisitions
those
involved
in
these
deals
say
oil
and
gas
companies
are
no
longer
rewarded
for
simply
grabbing
land
and
public
investors
have
become
more
discerning
regarding
acquisitions
notes
jon
marinelli
head
of
energy
investment
and
corporate
banking
at
bmo
capital
markets
shares
of
devon
energy
corp
qep
resources
inc
and
southwestern
energy
co
and
others
have
rallied
after
they
floated
plans
to
sell
acreage
reflecting
hopes
that
some
of
the
proceeds
will
return
to
investors
but
since
shareholders
across
the
industry
in
general
favor
shedding
assets
over
acquisitions
the
sentiment
makes
striking
new
deals
tricky
an
informal
poll
of
five
investment
bankers
by
reuters
put
the
share
of
sales
that
failed
to
close
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
and
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
at
between
percent
and
percent
with
marinelli
putting
the
figure
at
around
dealmaking
for
oil
and
gas
fields
going
into
was
already
stagnating
while
last
year
total
sales
were
only
marginally
down
from
at
billion
the
first
quarter
accounted
for
around
percent
of
that
figure
according
to
data
provider
pls
graphic
if
proposed
sales
fail
to
materialize
this
year
it
could
mean
a
time
of
reckoning
for
these
oil
and
gas
firms
if
these
companies
can
not
execute
the
divestiture
s
that
gave
investors
confidence
on
their
future
leverage
profile
you
would
likely
see
less
investors
trim
or
sell
their
positions

bhp
billiton
ltd
has
the
most
ambitious
plans
facing
the
same
pressure
from
shareholders
as
energy
producers
it
wants
to
sell
onshore
shale
assets
in
the
permian
eagle
ford
and
haynesville
basins
valuing
them
at
billion
on
its
balance
sheet
while
bhp
s
permian
and
eagle
ford
land
is
generally
considered
attractive
because
of
low
production
costs
one
of
the
eagle
ford
asset
packages
and
its
haynesville
fields
mainly
produce
shale
gas
making
them
less
appealing
to
buyers
given
gas
prices
bhp
would
consider
a
bid
that
valued
the
entire
business
below
the
company
s
original
valuation
if
it
ensured
no
unsold
assets
remained
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
sale
process
the
company
received
bids
from
interested
parties
on
may
although
a
final
decision
on
what
it
will
do
is
not
expected
for
a
few
months
for
those
weighing
acquisitions
bakken
operator
oasis
petroleum
offers
a
cautionary
tale
shares
in
the
company
fell
as
much
as
percent
in
the
two
days
after
it
said
on
it
paid
million
for
acreage
in
the
delaware
basin
since
then
major
land
purchases
by
oil
and
gas
firms
have
fizzled
with
executives
preaching
focus
on
controlling
costs
and
avoiding
unnecessary
expansion
we
can
do
a
whole
lot
of
great
work
by
hitting
some
singles
brad
holly
chief
executive
officer
of
whiting
petroleum
corp
told
an
industry
event
in
april
drawing
on
a
baseball
metaphor
to
describe
how
the
company
was
looking
for
some
really
small
things
to
add
to
its
existing
acreage
in
the
absence
of
companies
as
buyers
private
equity
firms
have
picked
up
some
slack
the
value
of
land
bought
by
buyout
firms
rose
to
percent
of
the
total
in
the
fourth
quarter
from
percent
in
the
first
three
months
of
according
to
pls
however
the
in
oil
prices
rather
than
whet
their
appetite
further
has
an
opposite
effect
making
private
equity
firms
wary
that
prices
may
not
be
as
strong
when
they
are
ready
to
cash
out
higher
crude
prices
also
boost
sellers
expectations
making
it
harder
for
buyout
firms
to
drive
a
hard
bargain
to
ensure
better
future
profits
such
calculations
gain
added
significance
after
years
of
returns
on
energy
stocks
trailing
other
sectors
if
energy
equity
markets
are
underperforming
the
wider
s
p
this
reduces
the
chance
of
private
equity
buying
larger
assets
because
you
don
t
think
you
ll
get
a
good
runway
for
an
exit
said

jacobson
partner
at
trilantic
capital
partners
some
sellers
have
now
started
moderating
their
expectations
hunt
oil
company
for
example
owned
by
one
of
texas
wealthiest
families
split
a
package
of
eagle
ford
land
it
was
marketing
for
up
to
million
in
the
fourth
quarter
into
three
individual
pieces
according
to
a
person
familiar
with
the
transaction
two
bits
went
to
private
equity
buyers
with
a
third
sold
to
penn
virginia
corp
for
million
the
person
added
the
decision
becomes
do
you
hold
your
nose
and
sell
or
do
you
retain
the
asset
