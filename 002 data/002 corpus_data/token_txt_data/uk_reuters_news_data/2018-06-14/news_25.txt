eu
negotiators
on
thursday
agreed
to
phase
out
the
use
of
palm
oil
in
transport
fuels
from
setting
up
a
clash
with
producer
countries
such
as
malaysia
and
indonesia
a
text
of
the
deal
seen
by
reuters
leaves
the
wording
on
details
of
curbs
on
palm
oil
yet
to
be
agreed
with
eu
sources
saying
the
matter
remains
politically
sensitive
limits
on
conventional
biofuels
in
transport
will
be
frozen
at
the
national
level
at
but
must
not
surpass
percent
the
text
says
green
lawmaker
bas
eickhout
one
of
the
negotiators
in
tough
talks
that
ran
until
the
early
morning
said
the
use
of
palm
oil
would
be
capped
at
levels
until
and
reduced
to
zero
by
that
is
quite
a
victory
there
is
no
precedent
for
a
of
the
use
of
specific
crops
said
eickhout
the
european
parliament
caused
an
outcry
among
palm
producers
in
asia
when
it
called
in
january
for
a
total
ban
on
palm
oil
use
in
road
fuel
as
part
of
its
negotiating
position
for
talks
with
member
states
to
hammer
out
the
final
deal
indonesia
malaysia
and
thailand
which
produce
the
majority
of
the
palm
oil
imported
into
europe
had
warned
ahead
of
thursday
s
agreement
they
would
retaliate
against
what
they
called
protectionist
measures
if
a
ban
was
introduced
a
study
funded
by
the
european
commission
found
that
palm
oil
and
soybean
oil
had
the
highest
indirect
greenhouse
gas
emissions
because
of
the
deforestation
and
the
drainage
of
peatlands
associated
with
their
cultivation
governments
now
have
no
more
excuse
to
force
drivers
to
burn
food
or
palm
oil
in
their
tanks
after
said
laura
buffet
at
campaign
group
transport
environment
palm
oil
has
been
used
increasingly
as
a
feedstock
for
biofuels
because
it
is
cheaper
than
locally
produced
rapeseed
oil
half
of
the
eu
s
billion
euros
billion
worth
of
palm
oil
imports
are
used
for
biodiesel
according
to
data
from
copenhagen
economics
thursday
s
agreement
is
part
of
a
broader
legislative
package
aimed
at
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
the
european
union
by
at
least
percent
below
levels
by
this
is
part
of
the
