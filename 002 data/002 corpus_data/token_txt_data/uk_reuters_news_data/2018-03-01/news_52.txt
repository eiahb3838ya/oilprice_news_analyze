fed
chief
powell
will
deliver
the
second
leg
of
his
testimony
on
thursday
an
opportunity
to
clarify
comments
made
on

that
rekindled
speculation
over
monetary
tightening
this
year
happening
faster
than
expected
powell
on
tuesday
vowed
to
prevent
the
economy
from
overheating
while
sticking
with
a
plan
to
gradually
raise
interest
rates
for
equity
markets
the
fear
is
that
a
in
the
pace
of
rate
rises
could
crimp
corporate
activity
and
cool
economic
growth
philip
shaw
chief
economist
at
investec
in
london
said
powell
s
testimony
was
unlikely
to
change
from
the
one
he
delivered
on
tuesday
putting
the
focus
on
the
question

session
he
powell
appears
to
have
got
an
easy
ride
from
lawmakers
in
the
sense
that
the
technical
questioning
on
tuesday
wasn
t
too
heavy
shaw
said
he
may
not
have
such
an
easy
time
today
with

the
dollar
meanwhile
has
taken
heart
from
the
fed
chair
s
comments
the
dollar
index
rose
to
a
high
it
has
clawed
back
from
the
trough
of

in
as
fears
of
a
ballooning
budget
deficit
and
worries
of
a
possible
policy
from
washington
took
a
toll
the
gap
between
borrowing
costs
in
the
united
states
and
germany
was
at
its
widest

in

there

about
