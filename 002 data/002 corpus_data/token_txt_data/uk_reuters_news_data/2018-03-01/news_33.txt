the
dollar
rose
to
a
high
on
thursday
on
solid
economic
data
but
remarks
by
the
new
federal
reserve
chief
that
there
no
evidence
of
an
overheating
economy
pushed
bond
yields
lower
even
as
stocks
wavered
on

in
his
second
testimony
in

jerome

also
told
the
senate

committee
that
the

did
not

the
remarks

market
concerns
from

testimony
on

that
sparked
fears
about
a
quicker
pace
of

larry
hatheway
chief
economist
at

investment
management
in
zurich
said
there
was
a
lack

the

comments
by
new

fed
president
william
dudley
stoked
the
embers
of
fears
during
remarks
in
sao
paulo
brazil
where
he
said
four
rate
hikes
or
one
more
than
the
fed
has
forecast
this
year
would
be
gradual
the
gap
between
borrowing
costs
and
those
in
germany
was
at
its
widest
in
over
years
as
the
monetary
policy
outlooks
by
the
fed
and
european
central
bank
for
the
two
regions
diverged
consumer
prices
increased
in
january
as
a
gauge
of
underlying
inflation
posting
its
largest
gain
in
months

a
survey
showed
the

boom
slowed
a
little
further
in
february
pressuring
euro
zone
yields
lower
in
the
we
have
at
least
three
rate
hikes
this
year
but
in
the
euro
zone
there
was
some
exaggeration
about
where
inflation
was
heading
so
that
is
now
being
priced
out
and
yields
are
moving
to
the
downside
said

oil
fell
more

hitting

on
pressure
from
a
strong

and
worries
that
surging
crude
output
might
thwart
efforts
