yerevan
reuters
armenia
has
scrapped
a
peace
agreement
it
signed
with
turkey
in
in
a
failed
attempt
to
normalise
relations
between
the
two
countries
the
armenian
president
s
press
service
said
on
thursday
armenia
and
turkey
signed
the
landmark
peace
accord
to
restore
ties
and
open
their
shared
border
after
a
century
of
hostility
stemming
from
the
world
war
one
mass
killing
of
armenians
by
ottoman
forces
the
deal
needed
parliamentary
approval
in
both
countries
but
was
never
ratified
and
the
armenian
and
turkish
governments
have
since
accused
each
other
of
trying
to
change
the
deal
as
a
result
of
discussions
president
serzh
sarksyan
signed
a
decree
and
a
national
security
council
approved
a
procedure
of
annulling
protocols
which
have
been
signed
on
october
the
press
service
said
in
a
statement
the
press
service
quoted
sarksyan
as
saying
that
armenia
did
everything
not
to
leave
the
burden
of
the
settlement
of
relations
between
armenia
and
turkey
on
the
shoulders
of
future
but
ankara
did
not
even
make
a
single
step
towards
ratification
and
implementation
of
protocols
but
also
left
no
doubt
that
it
was
not
intending
to
do
it
sarksyan
said
he
added
that
armenia
was
ready
to
cooperate
with
turkey
in
the
future
if
there
would
be
the
same
willingness
from
the
turkish
there
was
no
immediate
reaction
from
turkey
armenia
suspended
its
ratification
following
turkish
demands
that
it
first
reach
terms
over
a
breakaway
region
a
condition
turkey
set
to
appease
its
ally
azerbaijan
azerbaijan
feared
it
would
lose
leverage
in
negotiations
to
win
back
which
it
lost
to
forces
in
the
bloodiest
of
the
ethnic
conflicts
which
followed
the
collapse
of
the
soviet
union
armenian
president
sarksyan
also
faced
vehement
opposition
from
nationalists
at
home
and
the
powerful
armenian
diaspora
abroad
the
leadership
of
turkey
are
mistaken
if
they
think
that
those
documents
can
be
held
hostage
forever
and
ratified
only
at
the
most
opportune
occasion
from
their
very
point
of
view
sarksyan
said
in
a
speech
at
the
united
nation
s
general
assembly

autumn
