weeks

oil
prices
seem
to
have
one
eye
on
the
activity
of
the
equity

and
have
been
under
a
strong

the

a
high
early

retreated
in
the
afternoon
which
tempered
losses
in
crude

a
weaker
dollar
can
boost
oil
and
other
currencies
one
of
the
things
that
contributed
to
the
strength
of
the
oil
market
was
the
weakness
of
the
dollar
over
the
past
couple
months

again
gaining
the

at
