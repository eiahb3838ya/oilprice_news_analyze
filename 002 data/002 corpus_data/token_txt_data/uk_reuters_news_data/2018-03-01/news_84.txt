opposition
leaders
say
could
become
prime
minister
and
continue
to
wield
power
sarkissian
s
election
to
a
single
term
is
unopposed
because
the
ruling
republican
party
supports
him
even
though
he
is
not
a
member
of
any
party
one
opposition
party
says
it
will
back
him
while
another
has
failed
to
gather
sufficient
votes
to
present
its
own
candidate
armenia
seceded
from
the
soviet
union
in
but
remains
dependent
on
russia
for
aid
and
investment
many
armenians
accuse
the
government
of
corruption
and
mishandling
an
economy
that
has
struggled
to
overcome
the
legacy
of
central
planning
the
country
is
in
line
with
some
other
former
soviet
republics
and
countries
in
eastern
europe
in
moving
away
from
direct
democracy
and
towards
strong
central
leadership
according
to
analysts
sarksyan
became
president
at
an
election
in
and
nominated
former
prime
minister
sarkissian
in
january
to
succeed
him
as
his
term
neared
its
end
sarkissian
is
a
businessman
and
yerevan
s
ambassador
to
britain
and
the
president
said
he
had
chosen
him
because
of
his
experience
as
a
diplomat
and
manager
the
legislature
can
elect
a
president
with
a
majority
under
the
terms
of
a
constitution
approved
in
in
a
referendum
that
effectively
abolishes
direct
presidential
elections
this
week
s
vote
is
likely
to
take
place
on
thursday
or
friday
under
that
constitution
however
the
presidency
will
become
largely
ceremonial
and
power
will
shift
to
the
prime
minister
and
parliament
everything
has
been
done
to
create
a
super
premier
who
will
have
the
same
rights
as
the
current
president
and
even
more
opposition
mp
edmond
marukyan
told
reporters
sarksyan
denies
that
the
new
constitution
was
engineered
to
allow
him
to
continue
to
dominate
armenia
a
country
of
around
million
people
but
many
members
of
the
ruling
party
say
sarksyan
would
be
the
best
candidate
for
prime
minister
given
his
experience
especially
in
negotiations
over
neighbouring
azerbaijan
s
breakaway
region
fighting
between
ethnic
azeris
and
armenian
separatists
backed
by
armenia
first
erupted
in
and
a
ceasefire
was
agreed
in
but
azerbaijan
and
armenia
accuse
each
other
of
violence
around
and
along
their
common
border
clashes
over
control
of
which
lies
inside
azerbaijan
but
is
controlled
by
ethnic
armenians
have
intensified
in
the
past
three
years
and
turned
into
a
violent
of
the
conflict
in
april
the
ruling
party
won
parliamentary
elections
last
april
with
percent
of
the
vote
while
the
opposition
tsarukyan
alliance
took
