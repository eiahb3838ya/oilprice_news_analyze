the

set
more
ambitious

lawmakers
are
pushing
for
renewables
to
account
for
at

a
percent
share
by
while
national
governments
agreed
a

cost
projections
says
lower
costs
together
with

the
cost
of
reaching

target
in

would
be
comparable
to
reaching

target
under

in
the
assessment
such
lower
costs
for
the
energy
system
are
explained
by
lower

the

says
it
foresees
a
