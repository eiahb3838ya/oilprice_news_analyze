senior

said
south
africa
has
been
a
net
importer
of
wheat
for
some
years
mainly
from
russia
lithuania
and
other
east
european
countries
the
drought
is
also
expected
to
curb
exports
of
south
african
apples
pears
and
grapes
mainly
to
britain
and
other
european
union
states
as
well
as
russia
and
the

east
by

this

western
cape
s
famed
wine
industry
has
also
struggled
under
the
prolonged
drought
with
forecasts
indicating
the
next
grape
harvest
could
be
the
smallest
since
south
africa
normally
exports
around
million
litres
of
wine
annually
and
is
the
world
s
ninth
largest
producer
cape
town
whose
picturesque
ocean
front
location
with
mountain
backdrop
is
a
major
tourist
draw
expects
to
run
out
of
water
on
july
unless
residents
can
stick
to
a
rationing
plan
limiting
them
to
a
maximum
of
litres
per
person
per
day
the
city
is
drilling
for
underground
water
in
three
locations
to
help
rebuild
supplies
and
hopes
this
will
yield
a
peak
of
million
litres
a
day
by
the
end
of
a
series
of
restrictions
imposed
over
the
past
three
years
has
cut
collective
consumption
by
over
half
since
as
city
officials
look
to
see
out
the
hot
summer
months
into
winter
when
rain
normally
replenishes
reservoirs
if
each
one
of
us
continues
to
use
litres
a
day
we
can
not
only
beat
day
zero
this
year
but
also
be
in
a
better
position
to
avoid
it
next
