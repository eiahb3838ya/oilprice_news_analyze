exclusive-u.s. considering broad oil sanctions on venezuela -source
washington
reuters
the
trump
administration
is
considering
imposing
sanctions
on
a
venezuelan
oil
services
company
and
restricting
insurance
coverage
for
venezuelan
oil
shipments
to
increase
pressure
on
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
a
official
said
with
maduro
running
for
another
term
in
an
election
that
washington
and
its
allies
regard
as
a
sham
the
united
states
is
weighing
sanctions
that
would
target
venezuela
s
vital
oil
sector
beyond
what
has
been
done
before
the
official
told
reuters
on
wednesday
some
measures
could
come
before
the
vote
and
others
could
be
imposed
afterwards
the
official
who
is
close
to
internal
deliberations
on
venezuela
policy
and
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
would
not
rule
out
an
eventual
ban
on
venezuelan
oil
shipments
to
the
united
states
among
the
toughest
of
sanctions
i
think
it
would
cause
a
fairly
strong
shock
to
the
oil
market
in
the
short
term
the
official
said
the
official
stressed
that
no
decisions
have
been
made
and
that
any
action
would
take
into
consideration
potential
harm
to
ordinary
venezuelans
already
suffering
from
food
shortages
and
hyperinflation
and
the
country
s
neighbours
as
well
as
the
impact
on
the
oil
industry
and
consumers
venezuela
s
information
ministry
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
potential
further
sanctions
maduro
himself
subject
to
sanctions
last
year
regularly
laughs
off
washington
s
disapproval
and
blames
the
empire
for
his
country
s
economic
woes
saying
it
is
trying
to
undermine
venezuela
s
leftist
government
venezuela
was
the
fourth
largest
supplier
of
crude
oil
and
products
to
the
united
states
in
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
its
crude
oil
sales
to
the
united
states
last
year
were
the
lowest
since
according
to
thomson
reuters
trade
flows
data
oil
sanctions
are
not
taken
lightly
the
official
said
this
would
be
a
fairly
strong
escalation
for
policy
whether
it
s
a
complete
oil
sanction
or
salami
slices
of
different
graduated
president
donald
trump
s
administration
is
also
considering
possible
sanctions
against
additional
military
and
political
figures
including
socialist
party
no
diosdado
cabello
the
official
said
experts
say
sanctions
on
individuals
have
had
little
or
no
impact
on
the
venezuelan
government
s
policies
washington
s
crafting
of
new
sanctions
comes
as
venezuela
s
main
opposition
coalition
is
boycotting
the
election
citing
fraudulent
conditions
venezuela
s
election
board
postponed
the
presidential
vote
from
april
to
the
second
half
of
may
on
thursday
after
an
agreement
between
the
government
and
some
opposition
parties
critics
had
accused
venezuelan
authorities
of
holding
the
vote
early
in
the
year
to
the
opposition
the
official
had
said
before
news
of
the
date
change
that
even
if
venezuelan
authorities
delayed
the
election
by
a
month
or
two
it
was
not
likely
to
prompt
washington
to
hold
back
on
sanctions
the
best
tool
for
making
the
venezuelan
government
feel
economic
pain
government
sources
say
is
through
sectoral
sanctions
such
as
financial
measures
announced
in
august
that
barred
banks
from
any
new
debt
deals
with
venezuelan
authorities
or
oil
giant
pdvsa
venezuela
s
foreign
minister
jorge
arreaza
said
in
geneva
on
tuesday
that
sanctions
are
making
foreign
debt
renegotiation
more
difficult
and
causing
panic
at
global
banks
among
the
possible
new
targets
is
camimpeg
venezuela
s
oil
services
firm
the
official
said
camimpeg
provides
pdvsa
with
assistance
in
drilling
logistics
and
security
and
was
founded
by
the
military
in
although
little
is
known
about
its
activities
the
opposition
says
the
armed
forces
are
a
nest
of
corruption
and
accuse
maduro
of
trying
to
buy
the
support
of
military
chiefs
by
giving
them
increasing
control
of
the
opec
nation
s
crude
reserves
the
world
s
largest
another
option
would
be
sanctions
aimed
at
putting
restrictions
on
insurance
coverage
for
oil
tankers
and
oil
cargos
involving
pdvsa
the
official
said
oil
exports
are
typically
protected
by
insurance
on
tankers
as
well
as
on
the
cargo
without
insurance
a
vessel
can
not
navigate
in
international
waters
which
means
venezuela
s
oil
exports
would
likely
be
curtailed
sanctions
on
cargo
insurance
would
also
hurt
because
pdvsa
has
a
limited
tanker
fleet
the
trump
administration
is
still
considering
blocking
the
sale
of
lighter
crude
and
refined
products
that
venezuela
mixes
with
its
heavy
crude
and
then
exports
the
official
told
reuters
there
s
a
host
of
additional
sanctions
that
could
be
imposed
the
president
has
all
those
before
him
senator
marco
rubio
said
in
an
interview
with
reuters
rubio
has
pushed
for
trump
to
take
a
tougher
line
on
venezuela
than
former
president
barack
obama
in
a
commentary
in
the
miami
herald
rubio
called
for
a
united
front
of
disaffected
government
insiders
and
military
personnel
with
popular
support
from
the
venezuelan
people
to
remove
the
official
interviewed
by
reuters
reiterated
the
administration
s
stance
that
it
is
not
seeking
regime
the
venezuelan
government
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
rubio
s
remarks
maduro
and
other
senior
officials
have
frequently
accused
the
united
states
of
trying
to
provoke
a
coup
the
trump
administration
has
also
pressed
cuba
venezuela
s
ally
to
stop
propping
up
maduro
the
official
said
cuba
has
long
depended
on
caracas
for
oil
supplies
that
have
fallen
off
amid
venezuela
s
crisis
cuba
has
provided
venezuela
with
doctors
and
other
services

have
said
that

a
political
and
security
advisory
role

whether
washington

sanctions
on
cuban
officials

looking
at
all
