the
oil
and
gas
industry
on
thursday
slammed
president
donald
trump
s
plan
to
impose
tariffs
on
imported
steel
saying
the
move
would
kill
energy
jobs
by
raising
costs
for
big
infrastructure
projects
officials
at
the
nation
s
top
energy
industry
trade
groups
issued
statements
urging
trump
to
reconsider
the
idea
and
a
source
familiar
with
exxon
mobil
corp
s
investment
plans
said
the
tariff
could
lead
the
company
to
curtail
an
expansion
of
one
of
the
country
s
biggest
refineries
trump
said
on
thursday
he
would
impose
tariffs
of
percent
on
steel
imports
and
percent
on
imported
aluminum
next
week
in
a
move
intended
to
protect
industry
but
critics
said
it
would
fail
to
boost
jobs
and
risked
stoking
a
trade
war
with
china
pipeline
trade
groups
noted
that
the
cost
for
specialized
steel
needed
to
build
arteries
that
carry
petroleum
would
rise
we
are
urging
the
administration
to
avoid
killing
jobs
through
a
steel
tariff
that
impacts
pipelines
said
andy
black
ceo
of
the
association
of
oil
pipe
lines
aopl
the
energy
industry
relies
on
imported
steel
for
drilling
equipment
pipelines
liquefied
natural
gas
terminals
and
refineries
the
tariff
plan
is
inconsistent
with
the
administration
s
goal
of
continuing
the
energy
renaissance
and
building
world
class
infrastructure
said
jack
gerard
president
of
the
american
petroleum
institute
a
study
by
aopl
last
year
showed
that
a
percent
increase
in
pipeline
costs
could
increase
the
budget
for
a
typical
project
by
million
transcanada
s
proposed
keystone
xl
expansion
would
cost
at
least
million
more
a
spokeswoman
for
the
interstate
natural
gas
association
of
america
said
the
tariff
could
pose
a
problem
because
the
type
of
pipe
and
steel
used
to
make
interstate
pipelines
are
hard
to
source
domestically
both
groups
said
that
about
of
current
pipeline
project
spending
ends
up
in
the
pockets
of
american
workers
and
business
owners
the
center
for
liquefied
natural
gas
a
trade
group
said
tariffs
could
have
the
unintended
effect
of
endangering
lng
export
projects
which
use
special
steel
components
not
produced
in
the
united
states
lng
backers
are
trying
to
build
a
second
wave
of
export
facilities
that
cost
billions
of
dollars
each
the
tariffs
would
have
uncertain
impacts
on
coal
miners
who
make
up
a
portion
of
trump
s
base
luke
popovich
a
spokesman
for
the
national
mining
association
said
if
tariffs
boosted
domestic
steel
making
it
would
be
a
boon
for
some
producers
of
metallurgical
coal
used
in
steel
mills
but
metallurgical
coal
miners
also
export
to
markets
in
asia
a
business
that
has
soared
this
year
if
trump
s
tariffs
resulted
in
a
trade
war
with
asian
countries
it
could
harm
coal
miners
popovich
said
the
trump
administration
has
sought
to
support
all
sides
of
the
fossil
fuel
industry
but
that
has
at
times
led
to
squabbling
between
drillers
and
miners
a
source
familiar
with
exxon
deliberations
about
a
possible
expansion
of
the
beaumont
texas
refinery
said
an
increase
in
steel
prices
could
impact
the
company
s
decision
on
whether
to
add
a
third
unit
for
distillation
of
crude
the
source
said
exxon
could
bypass
duties
on
imported
steel
by
importing
the
components
of
a
crude
unit
directly
from
a
manufacturer
overseas
into
the
refinery
which
is
a
foreign
trade
zone
an
exxon
spokeswoman
was
not
immediately
available
to
discuss
the
company
s
plans
the
beaumont
refinery
currently
can
process
barrels
of
crude
a
day
a
proposed
expansion
would
make
it
the
nation
s
largest
meanwhile
a
railcar
manufacturing
executive
said
the
bulk
of
railcars
made
in
north
america
come
from
or
canadian
steel
and
fears
the
tariffs
will
trigger
a
trade
war
that
leads
to
higher
domestic
prices
roughly
percent
of
the
railcar
cost
comes
from
steel
said
the
executive
who
was
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
press
i
am
real
concerned
i
think
this
is
going
to
jack
up
prices
and
backfire
the
executive
said
farmers
said
they
also
feared
a
potential
trade
war
these
tariffs
are
very
likely
to
accelerate
a
approach
on
trade
putting
agricultural
exports
in
the
said
brian
kuehl
executive
director
of
farmers
for
free
trade
the
agriculture
sector
is
already
stinging
from
a
global
oversupply
of
crops
and
slumping
farm
incomes
china
which
imports
more
than
a
third
of
all
soybeans
could
retaliate
heaping
more
pain
on
the
sector
