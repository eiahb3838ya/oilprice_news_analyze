rpt-exclusive-u.s. mulls sanctions on venezuela to put pressure on maduro -source
washington
feb
reuters
the
trump
administration
is
considering
sanctioning
a
venezuelan
oil
services
company
and
restricting
insurance
coverage
for
venezuelan
oil
shipments
to
ratchet
up
pressure
on
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
a
official
said
on
wednesday
with
maduro
running
for
another
term
in
an
april
election
that
washington
and
its
allies
oppose
as
a
sham
the
united
states
is
weighing
sanctions
that
would
target
venezuela
s
vital
oil
sector
beyond
what
has
been
done
before
the
official
told
reuters
some
measures
could
come
before
the
vote
and
others
could
be
imposed
afterwards
the
official
who
is
close
to
internal
deliberations
on
venezuela
policy
and
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
would
not
rule
out
an
eventual
ban
on
venezuelan
oil
shipments
to
the
united
states
among
the
toughest
of
sanctions
i
think
it
would
cause
a
fairly
strong
shock
to
the
oil
market
in
the
short
term
the
official
said
the
official
stressed
that
no
decisions
have
been
made
and
that
any
action
would
take
into
consideration
potential
harm
to
ordinary
venezuelans
already
suffering
from
food
shortages
and
hyperinflation
and
the
country
s
neighbors
as
well
as
the
impact
on
the
oil
industry
and
american
consumers
venezuela
was
the
fourth
largest
supplier
of
crude
oil
and
products
to
the
united
states
in
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
its
crude
oil
sales
to
the
united
states
last
year
were
the
lowest
since
according
to
thomson
reuters
trade
flows
data
oil
sanctions
are
not
taken
lightly
the
official
said
this
would
be
a
fairly
strong
escalation
for
policy
whether
it
s
a
complete
oil
sanction
or
salami
slices
of
different
graduated
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
is
also
weighing
possible
sanctions
against
additional
senior
military
and
political
figures
including
socialist
party
no
diosdado
cabello
the
official
said
experts
say
individual
sanctions
have
had
little
or
no
impact
on
the
venezuelan
government
s
policies
maduro
himself
sanctioned
last
year
regularly
laughs
off
washington
s
disapproval
and
blames
the
empire
for
venezuela
s
economic
woes
venezuela
s
information
ministry
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
potential
further
sanctions
washington
s
crafting
of
new
sanctions
comes
as
venezuela
s
opposition
coalition
is
boycotting
the
april
election
citing
fraudulent
conditions
including
a
ban
on
its
top
two
candidates
from
running
even
if
venezuelan
authorities
delay
the
election
by
a
month
or
two
the
official
said
that
likely
would
not
prompt
the
administration
to
hold
back
on
sanctions
the
best
tool
for
making
the
venezuelan
government
feel
economic
pain
government
sources
say
is
through
sectoral
sanctions
such
as
financial
measures
announced
in
august
that
barred
banks
from
any
new
debt
deals
with
venezuelan
authorities
or
oil
giant
pdvsa
venezuela
s
foreign
minister
jorge
arreaza
said
in
geneva
on
tuesday
that
sanctions
are
making
foreign
debt
renegotiation
more
difficult
and
causing
panic
at
global
banks
new
sanctions
under
consideration
according
to
the
administration
official
would
be
intended
to
to
make
the
world
a
little
smaller
for
these
corrupt
among
the
possible
new
targets
is
camimpeg
venezuela
s
oil
services
firm
the
official
said
with
maduro
s
approval
venezuela
s
powerful
military
in
founded
camimpeg
which
is
geared
to
providing
pdvsa
with
assistance
in
drilling
logistics
and
security
little
is
known
about
camimpeg
s
activities
the
opposition
says
the
armed
forces
are
a
nest
of
corruption
and
the
unpopular
maduro
has
sought
to
buy
the
support
of
military
chiefs
by
giving
them
increasing
control
of
the
opec
nation
s
crude
reserves
the
world
s
largest
another
option
would
be
sanctions
aimed
at
putting
restrictions
on
insurance
coverage
for
oil
tankers
and
oil
cargos
involving
pdvsa
the
official
said
oil
exports
are
typically
protected
by
insurance
on
tankers
as
well
as
on
the
actual
cargo
without
insurance
a
vessel
can
not
navigate
in
international
waters
which
means
venezuela
s
oil
exports
would
likely
be
curtailed
sanctions
on
cargo
insurance
would
also
hurt
because
pdvsa
has
a
limited
tanker
fleet
in
addition
the
trump
administration
is
continuing
to
consider
blocking
the
sale
of
lighter
crude
and
refined
products
that
venezuela
mixes
with
its
heavy
crude
and
then
exports
the
official
told
reuters
there
s
a
host
of
additional
sanctions
that
could
be
imposed
the
president
has
all
those
before
him
said
senator
marco
rubio
who
has
played
a
key
role
in
pushing
for
trump
s
more
assertive
approach
to
venezuela
than
his
predecessor
barack
obama
the
goal
here
is
to
continue
to
pressure
an
illegitimate
regime
so
that
they
would
leave
power
or
be
removed
from
power
rubio
told
reuters
