any
potential
deals
between
manila
and
beijing
on
energy
exploration
in
the
south
china
sea
should
be
agreed
with
a
company
and
not
the
chinese
government
the
philippines
presidential
spokesman
said
on
thursday
china
claims
most
of
the
south
china
sea
a
key
route
in
global
trade
and
territory
whose
parts
are
subject
to
competing
claims
with
brunei
malaysia
taiwan
vietnam
and
the
philippines
we
might
enter
into
an
agreement
with
a
corporation
not
the
chinese
state
itself
harry
roque
the
spokesman
of
president
rodrigo
duterte
told
anc
news
channel
the
philippines
and
china
last
month
agreed
to
set
up
a
special
panel
to
work
out
how
they
can
jointly
explore
oil
and
gas
in
part
of
the
south
china
sea
that
both
sides
lay
claim
without
having
to
address
the
touchy
issue
of
sovereignty
pursuing
a
joint
project
would
be
extremely
complex
and
sensitive
as
sharing
oil
and
gas
reserves
could
be
seen
as
endorsing
other
countries
claims
we
are
not
entering
into
a
sovereign
agreement
for
exploration
it
will
be
an
agreement
if
we
do
between
two
corporate
entities
roque
said
the
philippines
suspended
exploration
in
the
reed
bank
in
as
it
pursued
international
arbitration
over
territorial
disputes
with
china
in
the
permanent
court
of
arbitration
in
the
hague
invalidated
china
s
claim
over
most
of
the
south
china
sea
though
beijing
refused
to
recognise
the
ruling
which
spelled
out
the
philippines
sovereign
rights
to
access
offshore
oil
and
gas
fields
including
the
reed
bank
within
its
mile
exclusive
economic
zone
negotiations
are
ongoing
with
a
chinese
company
roque
said
declining
to
name
the
entity
the
philippines
china
s
cnooc
ltd
and
petrovietnam
jointly
surveyed
the
reed
bank
in
to
this
will
now
actually
entail
joint
exploration
and
possible
exploitation
of
natural
resources
roque
said
however
there
are
doubts
a
joint
agreement
will
be
approved
because
china
does
not
favour
activities
that
they
have
to
undertake
jointly
with
other
people
roque
said
ties
with
china
have
warmed
under
duterte
who
has
put
aside
territorial
disputes
with
beijing
in
exchange
for
trade
opportunities
and
financing
in
key
infrastructure
projects
