any
potential
deals
between
manila
and
beijing
on
energy
exploration
in
the
south
china
sea
should
be
agreed
with
a
company
and
not
the
chinese
government
a
senior
philippine
official
said
on
thursday
china
claims
most
of
the
south
china
sea
a
key
trade
route
and
home
to
areas
that
are
believed
to
hold
large
quantities
of
oil
and
natural
gas
along
with
china
parts
of
the
south
china
sea
are
subject
to
competing
claims
from
brunei
malaysia
taiwan
vietnam
and
the
philippines
we
might
enter
into
an
agreement
with
a
corporation
not
the
chinese
state
itself
harry
roque
the
spokesman
for
president
rodrigo
duterte
told
anc
news
channel
the
two
countries
last
month
agreed
to
set
up
a
special
panel
to
work
out
how
they
can
jointly
explore
offshore
oil
and
gas
in
areas
both
sides
claim
without
needing
to
address
the
touchy
issue
of
sovereignty
pursuing
a
joint
project
would
be
extremely
complex
and
sensitive
as
sharing
oil
and
gas
reserves
could
be
seen
as
endorsing
the
other
countries
claims
we
are
not
entering
into
a
sovereign
agreement
for
exploration
it
will
be
an
agreement
if
we
do
between
two
corporate
entities
roque
said
duterte
said
late
wednesday
that
china
had
proposed
joint
exploration
that
was
like
and
better
than
the
two
fighting
over
it
roque
on
thursday
stressed
during
a
news
briefing
that
the
issue
was
about
joint
exploration
and
exploitation
as
a
practical
solution
for
the
philippines
to
access
resources
without
conflicts
over
sovereignty
he
said
duterte
was
using
as
an
analogy
to
try
to
simplify
the
issue
the
philippines
suspended
exploration
in
the
reed
bank
in
to
pursue
a
legal
challenge
to
china
s
territorial
claims
included
in
a
ruling
by
the
permanent
court
of
arbitration
in
the
hague
was
a
clarification
of
manila
s
sovereign
right
to
access
offshore
oil
and
gas
fields
including
the
reed
bank
within
its
mile
exclusive
economic
zone
negotiations
are
ongoing
with
a
chinese
company
roque
said
declining
to
name
the
entity
the
philippines
china
s
cnooc
ltd
and
petrovietnam
jointly
surveyed
the
reed
bank
in
to
roque
said
however
there
were
some
doubts
that
a
joint
agreement
would
work
because
china
did
not
favour
joint
activities
the
philippines
ties
with
china
have
warmed
under
duterte
who
has
put
aside
territorial
disputes
in
exchange
for
trade
opportunities
and
pledged
financing
for
infrastructure
projects
