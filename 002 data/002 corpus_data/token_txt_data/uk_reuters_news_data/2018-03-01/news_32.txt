volkswagen
s
bosses
missed
warning
signs
ahead
of
its
diesel
emissions
scandal
but
did
not
break
market
rules
by
delaying
the
disclosure
of
its
problems
the
carmaker
s
lawyers
said
in
a
submission
to
a
german
court
reviewed
by

investors
from
around
the
world
are
seeking
billion
euros
billion
in
damages
from
volkswagen
vw
which
they
say
didn
t
inform
shareholders
quickly
enough
over
its
use
of
illegal
software
to
cheat
tests
on
diesel
engine
emissions
about
lawsuits
nearly
all
from
institutional
investors
have
been
lodged
at
a
regional
court
in
braunschweig
near
vw
s
wolfsburg
headquarters
seeking
damages
over
the
sharp
fall
in
vw
shares
that
followed
its
admission
of
wrongdoing
in
a
submission
to
the
court
on
wednesday
lawyers
for
europe
s
largest
automaker
said
it
had
no
duty
to
disclose
the
possible
financial
damage
of
its
manipulations
prior
to
when
it
issued
an
statement
that
the
illegal
software
could
be
in
around
million
cars
worldwide
although
the
company
had
admitted
its
cheating
to
authorities
on
it
believed
potential
fines
from
regulators
and
vehicle
refitting
costs
would
not
exceed
million
euros
million
and
therefore
would
not
lead
to
a
significant
drop
in
the
stock
price
sources
close
to
vw
said
had
the
company
believed
the
financial
cost
of
its
cheating
could
have
reached
billion
euros
or
more
it
would
have
considered
an
earlier
release
the
sources
added
since
the
dieselgate
scandal
became
public
vw
has
set
aside
around
billion
to
cover
fines
vehicle
refits
to
remove
the
illegal
defeat
device
software
and
other
costs
in
the
past
there
have
again
and
again
been
violations
of
the
defeat
device
ban
in
environmental
law
but
without
the
affected
companies
getting
sanctioned
in
a
draconian
and
hard
way
vw
lawyers
said
in
the
submission
an
escalation
of
the
matter
wasn
t
expected
neither
by
the
defendants
nor
by
their
advisers
they
added
the
sources
said
former
vw
chief
executive
martin
winterkorn
who
resigned
within
a
week
of
the
scandal
breaking
was
informed
in
an
internal
memo
in
may
that
vw
models
had
violated
emissions
rules
and
authorities
would
check
whether
the
carmaker
was
using
illegal
software
however
they
said
the
implications
of
this
were
not
grasped
at
the
time
winterkorn
said
when
he
resigned
that
he
was
not
aware
of
any
wrongdoing
on
his
part
public
hearings
of
the
case
at
the
braunschweig
court
are
due
to
start
in
early
