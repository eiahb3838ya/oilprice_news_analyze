would
impose

on
steel
and

imports
next

the

the

peter
tuz
president
of
chase
investment
counsel
in
charlottesville
virginia
called
trump
s
proposed
tariffs
a
bombshell
announcement
that
might
help
the
steel
and
aluminum
industry
but
ultimately
hurt
stocks
it
s
helping
about
a
dozen
stocks
in
those
industries
but
has
raised
the
specter
of
trade
wars
and
trade
wars
don
t
help
the
stock
market
tuz
said
stocks
on
wall
street
had
mostly
traded
lower
before
trump
s
actions
weighed
by
remarks
by
federal
reserve
chair
jerome
powell
to
the
senate
banking
committee
in
congress
and
new
york
fed
president
william
dudley
in
sao
paulo
brazil
while
powell
tried
to
temper
remarks
he
made
on
tuesday
that
raised
concerns
about
the
potential
for
four
interest
rate
hikes
this
year
rather
than
the
fed
s
forecast
of
three
dudley
was
a
bit
more
pointed
and
said
four
rate
hikes
would
be
gradual
by
and
large
powell
painted
the
picture
of
an
economy
that
is
doing
well
and
even
a
little
bit
better
than
expected
and
that
s
prompted
fears
of
rising
inflation
four
rate
hikes
this
year
is
now
the
consensus
i
think
tuz
said
art
hogan
chief
market
strategist
at
riley
fbr
in
new
york
said
tariffs
have
not
worked
historically
and
they
cause
retaliation
this
is
sort
of
working
your
way
into
a
trade
war
which
is
a
drag
on
the
economy
it
is
also
inflationary
so
if
you
are
worried
about
inflation
it
is
going
to
pump
that

the

in
