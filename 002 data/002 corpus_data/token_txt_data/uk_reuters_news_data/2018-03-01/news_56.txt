traditional
commodity
traders
are
lamenting
the
rise
of
a
new
generation
of
hedge
funds
who
show
little
interest
in
the
fundamentals
of
conventional
supply
and
demand
analysis
the
newcomers
are
blamed
for
distorting
prices
making
markets
impossible
to
trade
and
forcing
the
closure
of
some
specialist
commodity
funds
the
target
of
this
criticism
is
not
always
it
variously
includes
traders
hedge
funds
and
macro
funds
dabbling
in
energy
markets
but
the
newcomers
are
operating
on
a
scale
never
seen
before
in
energy
markets
with
record
open
interest
in
futures
and
options
contracts
linked
to
crude
oil
and
refined
products
money
managers
a
category
which
includes
many
hedge
funds
and
other
investors
have
accumulated
record
positions
in
crude
gasoline
and
distillates
since
the
middle
of
last
year
according
to
regulatory
data
by
the
end
of
january
money
managers
had
established
a
bullish
position
in
futures
and
options
contracts
equivalent
to
almost
billion
barrels
of
crude
gasoline
and
distillates
the
net
long
position
was
more
than
million
barrels
higher
than
the
previous
peak
in
february
and
almost
million
barrels
higher
than
the
peak
before
that
in
june
who
trades
oil
is
changing
according
to
the
financial
times
fundamentals
do
not
matter
to
a
new
breed
of
oil
speculator
investors
who
bother
little
with
details
such
as
inventories
and
pipeline
flows
are
replacing
dwindling
ranks
of
specialist
commodity
funds
the
shift
could
alter
the
way
prices
are
criticism
that
outsiders
are
distorting
the
proper
function
of
commodity
markets
is
as
old
as
commodity
markets
themselves
algorithmic
and
traders
have
been
blamed
for
exacerbating
price
volatility
for
over
a
decade
commodity
specialists
complain
the
prevalence
of
trading
has
reached
a
tipping
point
distorting
prices
and
forcing
the
closure
hedge
funds
data
overload
commodity
hedge
funds
close
as
computers
dominate
reuters
the
complaints
are
an
echo
from
a
decade
ago
when
pension
funds
and
other
index
investors
labelled
massive
passives
were
blamed
for
driving
up
food
and
fuel
prices
in
and
it
is
worth
noting
that
traders
and
index
investors
have
been
blamed
for
opposite
problems
one
for
trading
too
much
the
other
for
trading
too
little
yet
are
often
lumped
together
such
criticisms
are
not
new
i
can
remember
similar
comments
when
i
first
worked
on
a
trading
floor
in
the
early
commodity
producers
and
consumers
have
long
blamed
speculators
for
distorting
prices
that
should
be
set
by
physical
supply
and
demand
in
turn
specialist
speculators
blamed
an
influx
of
hedge
funds
and
technical
black
box
traders
for
worsening
volatility
now
hedge
funds
blame
traders
and
macro
tourists
it
is
the
familiar
cry
of
the
incumbent
establishment
against
innovators
and
insurgents
reinvented
for
each
generation
all
traders
on
futures
markets
other
than
hedgers
are
speculators
wrote
economist
blair
stewart
almost
years
ago
in
what
remains
probably
the
most
study
of
futures
trading
frequently
these
speculators
know
little
or
nothing
about
the
commodity
in
which
they
deal
and
have
little
knowledge
of
the
methods
of
producing
grading
shipping
storing
and
using
the
product
stewart
noted
stewart
concluded
that
lack
of
specialist
knowledge
did
not
have
much
effect
on
the
profitability
of
their
trading

exchange
authority
many
traders
are
concerned
almost
entirely
with
very
price
fluctuations
stewart
discovered
after
analysing
thousands
of
customer
trading
records
from
the
and
from
a
large
brokerage
in
chicago
stewart
noted
that
many
traders
implemented
a
strategy
as
if
there
was
a
definite
price
level
around
which
fluctuations
will
oscillate
buying
when
prices
fell
below
it
selling
when
prices
rose
above
others
tried
to
detect
short
swings
in
the
market
at
their
inception
and
put
on
a
position
intended
to
benefit
from
continued
movement
in
the
same
direction
stewart
termed
these
two
groups
level
traders
and
movement
traders
the
modern
equivalents
are
and
momentum
but
the
strategies
themselves
have
not
changed
the
critical
point
is
that
all
these
strategies
were
based
on
prices
themselves
rather
than
a
detailed
analysis
of
supply
and
demand
fundamentals
the
roles
of
speculation
versus
fundamentals
was
already
controversial
in
the
role
of
the
small
speculative
trader
in
the
futures
market
has
been
the
subject
of
much
discussion
according
to
stewart
on
the
one
hand
it
has
been
held
that
such
traders
are
a
disturbing
influence
in
the
market
accentuating
price
swings
and
on
occasions
contributing
to
wild
and
disastrous
price
on
the
other
hand
it
has
been
maintained
that
such
traders
are
a
necessary
element
in
the
market
since
their
presence
makes
it
possible
for
the
expert
trader
who
is
presumed
to
exercise
a
beneficent
influence
on
prices
to
find
traders
to
take
the
opposite
side
of
his
trades
and
supply
through
their
losses
the
income
which
is
necessary
to
support
the
continued
trading
activity
of
the
the
debate
has
continued
more
or
less
unchanged
in
the
intervening
decades
in
most
cases
generating
more
heat
than
light
while
some
researchers
and
commentators
insist
price
movements
are
entirely
explained
by
fundamentals
and
others
entirely
by
speculation
most
accept
prices
are
driven
by
a
mix
of
both
fundamentals
clearly
dominate
price
formation
in
the
long
term
speculation
likely
drives
price
movements
in
the
short
term
and
between
the
two
time
horizons
fundamentals
and
speculation
both
play
a
role
speculation
can
accelerate
and
exaggerate
price
movements
causing
them
to
overshoot
in
the
short
term
but
in
the
longer
term
prices
reflect
underlying
production
and
consumption
conditions
speculation
likely
adds
to
volatility
but
it
may
also
dampen
price
fluctuations
in
the
medium
term
by
accelerating
the
price
discovery
process
there
is
a
temptation
to
see
fundamentals
as
the
cause
of
price
moves
while
speculation
is
responsible
for
ones
there
is
also
an
incentive
for
traders
analysts
and
journalists
to
ascribe
price
movements
to
fundamentals
when
they
predict
them
correctly
and
agree
with
them
but
blame
speculation
when
prices
move
in
the
opposite
direction
in
practice
it
is
neither
possible
nor
sensible
to
try
to
decompose
price
movements
in
this
way
which
makes
the
whole
argument
about
fundamentals
versus
speculation
somewhat
empty
