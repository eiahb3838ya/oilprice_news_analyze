renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
a
law
requiring
refiners

under
the
rfs
refiners
must
cover
the
costs
of
blending
increasing
volumes
of
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
gasoline
and
diesel
each
year
to

compliance
with
the
program
they
have
to
acquire
credits
called
rins
either
by
earning
them
through
blending
or
by
buying
them
the
price
of
rins
has
surged

meaning
refiners
without
blending
facilities
have
faced
higher
costs
at
tuesday
s
meeting
grassley

ernst
were
asked
to
consider
accepting
a
proposed
ceiling
on
the
price

of
gasoline
blends

i
suggested
specific
policy
changes

a
for
biofuels
and
oil
but
we
ve
made
it
clear

a
cap
or
waiver
credit
for
