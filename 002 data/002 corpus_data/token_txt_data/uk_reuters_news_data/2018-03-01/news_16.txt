for
a
billion
billion
clearing
its
path
to
proceed
with
a
national
scheme
to
expand
hydro
generation
under
pressure
to
plug
power
supply
gaps
which
have
led
to
blackouts
as
well
as
cap
soaring
prices
prime

malcolm
turnbull
announced
plans
last
year
to
expand
hydro
generation
in
australia
s
southeast
by
around
percent
owning
the
assets
itself
makes
it
simpler
for
the
national
government
to
go
ahead
without
the
states
controlling
snowy

ltd
the
holding
company
that
runs
the
giant
scheme
it
will
enable
snowy
to
go
ahead
minister

the
environment
and
energy
josh
frydenberg
told
australian
broadcasting
radio
referring
to
the
government
s
expansion
plan
will
create
new
jobs
more
power
for
new

as
well
as
lowering
people

power
bill
and
helping
to
stabilise
the
energy
under
the
deal
victoria
state
will
receive
just
under
a

will
receive
a
billion
for
their
shares
in
snowy
hydro
ltd
which
operates
a
giant
hydroelectric
scheme
in
australia
s
snowy

the
states
agreed

on
other
infrastructure
projects
under
the
deal
which
must
be
approved
by
the
federal
and
victorian
parliament
before
it
takes
effect
a
statement
from
the
federal
government
said
the
national
plan
would
add
megawatts
of
capacity
to
what
is
already
the
country
s
biggest
hydro
scheme
and
cost
as
much
as
a
billion
a
feasibility
study
last
year
found
the
project
was
viable
and
technically
feasible
but
it
still
requires
a
final
investment
decision
in
hinging
partly
on
major
upgrades
of
transmission
lines
if
approved
the
first
power
is
expected
in
late
at
the
earliest
the
federal
government
said
it
would
keep
snowy
hydro
ltd
in
public
ownership
and
make
no
changes
to
employment
levels
or
water
allocation
