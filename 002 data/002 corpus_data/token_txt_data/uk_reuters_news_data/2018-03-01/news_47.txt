update 2-britain told to "carry on cooking" despite gas supply warning
london
reuters
british
households
were
told
to
carry
on
cooking
by
the
government
on
thursday
as
a
warning
of
a
gas
supply
deficit
spooked
the
market
and
raised
questions
over
the
country
s
gas
policy
a
nationwide
cold
snap
with
temperatures
as
low
as
minus
degrees
celsius
and
widespread
snow
has
led
to
a
sharp
increase
in
gas
demand
which
is
used
to
heat
as
much
as
percent
of
britain
s
homes
and
also
for
cooking
prices
for
gas
delivery
have
more
than
quadrupled
since
the
start
of
the
week
to
pence
per
therm
on
thursday
the
highest
in
at
least
years
energy
minister
claire
perry
said
there
would
be
no
disruption
to
domestic
supplies
and
encouraged
britons
to
carrying
on
using
your
gas
heating
and
cooking
meals
as
normal
national
grid
which
maintains
the
country
s
gas
and
electricity
systems
also
moved
to
calm
the
country
and
said
its
early
morning
alert
over
a
potential
gas
deficit
was
a
part
of
its
tool
kit
to
secure
supplies
from
the
market
but
the
warning
has
concerns
that
britain
has
become
too
reliant
on
imports
of
gas
and
is
vulnerable
to
supply
shocks
especially
after
the
closure
last
year
of
the
country
s
largest
gas
storage
site
rough
at
its
operational
peak
the
more
than
site
could
hold
percent
of
britain
s
gas
demand
but
operator
british
centrica
announced
its
closure
last
year
and
said
its
maintenance
had
become
too
costly
allowing
centrica
to
close
rough
without
consideration
for
supply
during
cold
snaps
put
households
and
businesses
at
risk
of
shortages
and
price
spikes
said
jonathan
marshall
an
analyst
at
the
energy
and
climate
intelligence
unit
a
spokeswoman
for
the
department
for
business
energy
and
industrial
strategy
said
britain
has
many
sources
of
gas
supply
and
rough
s
closure
did
not
undermine
the
country
s
security
of
gas
supplies
as
part
of
our
ongoing
dialogue
with
the
industry
representatives
from
across
the
storage
industry
will
meet
at
the
department
later
this
month
to
discuss
the
market
s
investment
in
gas
storage
she
said
via
email
ultimately
decisions
on
investment
in
gas
storage
are
made
by
the
market
she
said
wholesale
electricity
prices
in
britain
have
also
soared
by
more
than
percent
to
almost
pounds
per
megawatt
hour
on
thursday
the
cold
snap
comes
just
days
after
a
law
was
introduced
in
britain
s
parliament
aimed
a
capping
consumers
energy
bills
a
move
which
centrica
said
could
hurt
competition
beis
said
it
did
not
expect
the
wholesale
price
rise
to
lead
to
higher
prices
for
households
as
energy
firms
typically
hedge
their
exposure
to
commodity
prices
many
months
in
advance
we
would
therefore
not
expect
this
increase
in
wholesale
prices
to
feed
through
to
household
bills

spokeswoman
