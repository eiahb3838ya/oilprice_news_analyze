no upside in brexit for british car industry -lawmakers
london
reuters
britain
must
maintain
free
trade
and
european
union
regulatory
alignment
for
the
automotive
industry
as
brexit
offers
no
upside
for
the
sector
a
committee
of
mps
said
as
one
of
britain
s
few
manufacturing
success
stories
since
the
the
car
industry
employs
more
than
people
and
generates
turnover
of
billion
pounds
but
companies
are
worried
that
britain
s
exit
from
the
single
market
could
lead
to
customs
checks
trade
barriers
and
tariffs
which
would
push
up
costs
and
risk
the
viability
of
their
factories
there
is
no
credible
argument
to
suggest
there
are
advantages
to
be
gained
from
brexit
for
the
uk
car
industry
the
chairwoman
of
britain
s
business
committee
rachel
reeves
an
opposition
labour
lawmaker
said
on
thursday
the
prime
minister
now
needs
to
ensure
common
sense
pragmatism
prevails
and
spell
out
the
government
s
intention
to
seek
continued
regulatory
and
trading
alignment
with
the
eu
in
the
automotive
sector
she
said
ministers
have
promised
to
align
british
regulations
with
eu
ones
in
some
areas
such
as
the
automotive
sector
and
maintain
free
and
unfettered
trade
with
the
industry
s
biggest
export
market
toyota
said
on
wednesday
it
will
build
the
next
generation
of
its
auris
car
at
its
english
plant
but
warned
that
continued
free
and
frictionless
trade
was
vital
for
future
however
executives
had
told
the
committee
that
some
firms
such
as
honda
are
considering
building
extra
warehouses
and
stockpiling
parts
to
protect
their
operations
from
any
delays
as
a
result
of
brexit
which
would
add
cost
mps
also
concluded
that
britain
should
maintain
existing
certification
arrangements
by
which
cars
approved
in
britain
can
be
used
on
the
continent
and
vice
versa
on
monday
the
chief
executive
of
aston
martin
told
reuters
the
luxury
carmaker
was
using
a
regulator
in
the
european
union
rather
than
britain
s
own
body
to
approve
its
new
car
due
to
uncertainty
over
future
regulations
we
recommend
that
the
government
prioritise
the
continuation
of
existing
arrangements
for
the
vehicle
certification
agency
to
authorise
type
approvals
for
the
european
single
market
whether
as
part
of
a
mutual
recognition
agreement
or
some
alternative
arrangement
