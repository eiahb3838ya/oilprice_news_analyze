venezuelan
presidential
candidate
henri
falcon
said
on
wednesday
he
would
like
a
wall
street
economist
who
sees
dollarization
as
the
solution
for
in
venezuela
to
play
a
big
role
on
his
team
if
he
wins
the
upcoming
election
falcon
said
francisco
rodriguez
a
venezuelan
who
is
chief
economist
at
torino
capital
and
advising
him
informally
would
be
the
ideal
leader
of
his
economic
team
should
he
defeat
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
what
is
the
cancer
of
venezuela
apart
from
the
government
the
economy
so
the
economy
is
for
specialists
he
told
reuters
during
an
interview
at
his
new
offices
in
caracas
francisco
is
a
man
with
many
qualifications
but
he
is
also
a
politician
recognized
internally
and
abroad
we
need
to
build
a
really
good
team
led
by
a
great
economist
that
s
francisco
rodriguez
one
of
the
most
influential
analysts
of
venezuela
s
dysfunctional
economy
has
recently
been
suggesting
the
bolivar
currency
should
be
scrapped
for
the
dollar
as
an
extreme
measure
to
fix
runaway
inflation
by
stopping
the
government
from
printing
excess
money
rodriguez
also
believes
venezuela
in
the
fifth
year
of
crippling
recession
that
has
left
millions
hungry
and
created
widespread
shortages
would
receive
major
help
from
international
loan
bodies
like
the
world
bank
and
international
monetary
fund
under
a
new
government
speaking
to
reuters
earlier
on
wednesday
on
the
sidelines
of
a
caracas
forum
rodriguez
confirmed
he
was
giving
informal
advice
to
falcon
i
m
a
friend
i
respect
him
he
said
he
told
the
forum
falcon
would
make
an
excellent
president
this
country
can
not
survive
six
more
years
of
nicolas
maduro
this
country
doesn
t
deserve
that
he
added
falcon
a
former
state
governor
who
has
broken
with
an
opposition
boycott
to
run
against
maduro
said
he
would
prioritize
repairing
relations
with
washington
should
he
win
the
vote
slated
for
april
while
most
analysts
give
him
little
chance
some
recent
polls
actually
put
him
ahead
of
maduro
in
voter
preferences
the
united
states
would
have
a
potential
ally
in
a
new
venezuelan
government
said
falcon
who
defines
himself
as
a
in
favor
of
both
policies
and
strong
welfare
protection
programs
falcon
implied
he
disagreed
with
possible
oil
sanctions
against
opec
member
venezuela
saying
he
opposed
any
measures
that
end
up
hurting
the
president
donald
trump
s
administration
has
already
slapped
some
individual
sanctions
on
officials
it
deems
guilty
of
rights
abuses
or
eroding
democracy
in
venezuela
and
has
also
imposed
measures
to
block
new
financing
for
the
government
it
is
pondering
measures
against
the
oil
sector
if
maduro
does
not
improve
conditions
for
the
election
which
critics
say
has
been
rigged
to
legitimize
falcon
a
former
military
man
who
supported
the
ruling
socialists
until
a
split
has
drawn
the
wrath
of
venezuela
s
opposition
coalition
by
throwing
his
hat
into
the
ring
and
undercutting
their
boycott
policy
abstention
is
no
use
he
said
pointing
to
past
boycotts
that
had
given
the
socialists
big
uncontested
wins
and
arguing
that
percent
of
venezuelans
wanted
change
in
world
history
at
least
for
the
last
two
centuries
no
government
has
won
an
election
at
a
time
of
he
added
citing
the
price
of
a
box
of
eggs
equivalent
to
nearly
of
the
minimum
monthly
wage
prices
in
venezuela
rose
more
than
percent
in
the
months
to
the
end
of
january
according
to
estimates
by
the
country
s
national
assembly
broadly
in
line
with
independent
economists
figures
falcon
is
demanding
improved
election
conditions
including
a
later
vote
date
observers
an
end
to
harassment
of
maduro
opponents
and
the
removal
of
government
handout
booths
known
as
red
spots
to
curry
favor
with
voters
often
set
up
near
polling
centers
without
guarantees
he
may
withdraw
his
candidacy
falcon
said
he
would
like
veteran
venezuelan
politician
eduardo
fernandez
a
former
presidential
candidate
for
opposition
party
copei
to
be
his
foreign
minister
he
would
not
be
drawn
on
specific
economic
policy
ideas
beyond
saying
he
wanted
to
prioritize
tackling
inflation
and
supported
a
unified
currency
exchange
system
instead
of
the
current
mix
of
government
and
black
market
rates
