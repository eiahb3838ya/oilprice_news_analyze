dispute

after

s
gazprom

decided

restart

forcing
ukraine
to
cut
usage
despite
freezing
weather

s
energy
firm
naftogaz
said
it
would
ask
heating
firms
to
use
percent
less
gas
for
four
days
from
saturday
it
also
said
it
would
seek
compensation
from
gazprom
the
row
threatens
to
open
a
new
front
in
a
legal
battle
between
the
companies
a
of
broader
political
tension
following
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
in
and
support
for
separatists
in
eastern
ukraine
it
follows
wednesday
s
international
arbitration
court
order
for
gazprom
to
pay
billion
to
naftogaz
after
weighing
mutual
claims
and
related
to
gas
supplies
and
transit
on
thursday
gazprom
said
it
had
returned
a
prepayment
to
ukraine
and
would
not
restart
gas
supplies
as
an
additional
agreement
to
the
existing
arrangements
had
still
not
been
reached
it
did
not
give
further
details
clearly
gas
supplies
to
ukraine
s
naftogaz
will
not
be
carried
out
from
march
gazprom
s
deputy
head
alexander
medvedev
said
in
a
statement
the
decision
is
connected
to
the
stockholm
arbitration
court
dispute
because
in
one
of
its
rulings
the
court
ordered
naftogaz
to
buy
billion
cubic
metres
of
gas
from
gazprom
annually
from
the
march
deliveries
would
have
been
the
first
time
ukraine
bought
gas
from
russia
since
november
when
it
started
buying
gas
from
europe
via
reverse
flows
to
try
to
cut
its
energy
dependency
on
moscow
reverse
flows
refer
to
buying
russian
gas
that
has
first
been
exported
to
another
country
naftogaz
said
it
would
seek
damages
from
gazprom
for
its
failure
to
restart
daily
deliveries
of
million
cubic
metres
of
gas
which
has
forced
it
to
take
emergency
measures
to
make
up
for
the
shortage
at
a
time
when
a
cold
snap
has
blanketed
most
of
ukraine
with
heavy
snow
these
include
cutting
consumption
and
buying
extra
supplies
from
europe
naftogaz
chief
executive
andriy
kobolev
said
in
televised
comments
these
steps
should
be
sufficient
in
order
not
to
create
a
gas
deficit
in
the
system
he
said
in
later
comments
kobolev
said
gazprom
s
decision
meant
naftogaz
was
no
longer
bound
by
a
clause
in
their
agreement
that
requires
buyers
to
pay
for
gas
whether
they
take
physical
delivery
or
not
they
can
not
demand
take
or
pay
from
us
in
news
agency
interfax
ukraine
quoted
him
as
saying
meanwhile
gazprom
said
earlier
on
thursday
it
would
contest
the
stockholm
order
for
it
to
pay
naftogaz
billion
gazprom
will
defend
its
rights
by
all
available
means
in
accordance
with
the
applicable
law
it
said
in
a
statement
disagreements
between
gazprom
and
naftogaz
predate
the
collapse
in
relations
between
ukraine
and
russia
in
following
the
uprising
in
kiev
that
ousted
a
president
pricing
disputes
in
the
past
led
to
russian
gas
supplies
disruptions
to
europe
via
ukraine
including
in
and
since
then
russia
has
been
pushing
for
new
pipeline
projects
via
the
baltic
and
black
seas
to
bypass
ukraine
