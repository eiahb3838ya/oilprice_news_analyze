the

came
amid

on

street
where
the

and

capped
their
worst
months
since

overnight
after

sharp
losses
early

the

scaled
an
high
late

about

it
went
on
to
recover
a
bulk
of
those

but
the
rebound
stalled
in
the
wake
of
powell
s
comments
the
fed
s
last
round
of
economic
projections
in
december
pointed
to
three
rate
increases
this
year
but
powell
s
remarks
prompted
investors
to
wager
on
four
rate
rises
instead
the
markets
will
try
to
further
price
in
prospects
of
accelerated
fed
tightening
if
the
employment
report
on
march
and
inflation
data
on
march
point
to
growth
in
wages
and
a
rise
in
prices
said
masahiro
ichikawa
senior
strategist
at

mitsui
asset
management
in
tokyo
in
such
a
case
we
could
see
another
round
of
rising
treasury
yields
dollar
appreciation
and
decline
in
the
dollar
which
retreated
to

last

has
taken
heart
from
the
fed
chair
s
comments
the
dollar
index
against
a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
rose
to
its
highest
since
and
last
stood
at
the
index
has
managed
to
claw
back
from
the
trough
of
set
in
when
fears
of
a
ballooning
budget
deficit
and
lingering
worries
that
washington
could
pursue
a
weak
dollar
policy
took
a
toll
the
comeback
by
the
dollar
could
negatively
impact
crude
oil
prices
and
in
turn
cool
inflation
expectations
in
that
case
the
equity
markets
could
be
forced
to
undergo
significant
adjustments

a
stronger
greenback
tends
to
weigh
