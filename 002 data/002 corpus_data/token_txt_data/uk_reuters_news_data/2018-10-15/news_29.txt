major
bp
said
on
monday
fuel
price
controls
were
not
good
days
after
india
asked
fuel
retailers
to
shield
customers
from
costs
by
cutting
margins
bp
has
a
with
reliance
industries
owner
of
the
world
s
biggest
refining
complex
to
enter
india
s
downstream
sector
including
natural
gas
marketing
and
retail
fuel
sales
i
think
that
price
controls
are
a
kind
of
thing
that
will
not
be
good
for
the
sector
in
the
longer
term
bob
dudley
group
chief
executive
of
bp
said
at
the
india
energy
forum
organised
by
ihs
cera
he
did
not
comment
on
when
bp
would
open
its
first
fuel
retail
outlet
in
india
in
partnership
with
reliance
india
cut
taxes
on
diesel
and
gasoline
this
month
and
asked
state
companies
which
account
for
the
bulk
of
retail
fuel
sales
in
the
country
to
reduce
the
price
of
the
two
sensitive
by
one
rupees
on
every
litre
of
fuel
sold
the
move
was
widely
seen
as
government
intervention
in
local
fuel
pricing
although
finance
minister
arun
jaitley
and
oil
minister
dharmendra
pradhan
had
said
the
step
should
not
be
seen
as
going
back
to
a
regulated
regime
the
government
has
since
said
it
would
not
interfere
with
prices
of
gasoline
and
diesel
i
have
not
heard
any
suggestions
that
india
will
go
back
to
price
controls
there
have
been
some
reductions
on
parts
of
the
taxes
dudley
told
reporters
in
new
delhi
on
monday
bp
which
has
tied
up
with
reliance
to
explore
gas
fields
in
india
expects
to
have
a
percent
gas
market
share
by
dudley
said
adding
he
expected
bp
india
s
gas
production
with
reliance
to
be
billion
cubic
feet
per
day
in
five
years
he
said
he
was
hopeful
that
over
that
timeframe
the
company
would
have
large
retailing
partnerships
with
reliance
and
a
strong
presence
in
india
s
solar
market
in
bp
paid
billion
to
buy
a
percent
stake
in
reliance
s
fields
and
promised
an
additional
billion
for
future
performance
payments
however
both
companies
held
off
from
announcing
any
major
investments
in
the
field
as
the
local
natural
gas
price
did
not
support
a
sufficient
return
on
investment
the
government
allowed
higher
prices
from
deepwater
natural
gas
reserves
from
october
dudley
said
the
low
natural
gas
price
in
india
before
was
a
major
factor
that
slowed
down
its
investments
in
the
country
last
year
reliance
and
bp
announced
an
investment
of
billion
to
develop
three
fields
in
the
east
coast
of
india
which
would
add
around
million
standard
cubic
metres
per
day
mscmd
of
gas
between
and
we
plan
for
the
long
term
and
we
re
here
in
india
for
the
long
term
