update 1-britain's cuadrilla starts fracking for gas after seven-year pause
london
reuters
british
shale
gas
company
cuadrilla
has
started
fracking
for
natural
gas
in
northwest
england
seven
years
after
the
practice
was
halted
in
britain
for
causing
earth
tremors
environmental
groups
strongly
oppose
the
practice
of
hydraulic
fracturing
or
fracking
which
involves
extracting
gas
from
rocks
by
breaking
them
up
with
water
and
chemicals
at
high
pressure
but
the
government
keen
to
cut
britain
s
reliance
on
imports
as
north
sea
gas
supplies
dry
up
has
tightened
regulations
and
has
given
cuadrilla
permission
to
frack
two
wells
at
its
preston

site

lancashire

and
percent
owned
by
a
fund
managed
by
riverstone
said
it
would
spend
at
least
three
months
fracking
two
horizontal
wells
to
test
flow
rates
to
determine
whether
gas
extraction
would
be
viable
the
british
geological
survey
estimates
shale
gas
resources
in
northern
england
alone
could
amount
to
trillion
cubic
feet
tcf
of
gas
percent
of
which
could
meet
the
britain
s
demand
for
almost
years
shale
gas
has
the
potential
to
be
a
new
domestic
energy
source
enhancing
our
energy
security
and
delivering
economic
benefits
including
the
creation
of
quality
jobs
the
department
for
business
energy
and
industrial
strategy
said
we
have
been
clear
that
any
shale
developments
must
be
safe
and
environmentally
sound
the
department
added
in
a
statement
attempts
to
extract
the
gas
have
come
under
fire
from
local
communities
and
campaigners
concerned
about
the
potential
effect
on
the
environment
and
ground
water
they
say
extracting
more
fossil
fuel
is
at
odds
with
britain
s
commitment
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
it
is
morally
bankrupt
to
be
heralding
the
start
of
a
whole
new
fossil
fuel
industry

group
friends
of
the
earth
said
in
a
statement
you
can
deal
with
climate
change
or
you
can
have
fracking
you
can
t
do
both
he
said
the
government
asked
its
climate
advisers
on
monday
to
examine
whether
britain
should
toughen
its
climate
targets
and
set
a
date
to
move
to
a
net
zero
emissions
goal
britain
has
an
existing
target
to
cut
its
greenhouse
gas
emissions
