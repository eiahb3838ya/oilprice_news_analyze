refinitiv
data
as
an
economic

gave

approval
to
arrange
this
payment
said
one

referring

venezuela

who
is
also
president

spoke
last

not
authorized
to

neither
pdvsa

ministry
immediately
responded
to
requests
for
comment
pdvsa
must
pay
million
by
to
cover
an
amortization
payment
on
the
bond
and
then
has
more
days
to
make
a
million
interest
payment
pdvsa
has
been
making
payments
on
the
bond
and
they
tell
us
they
plan
to
keep
doing
so
said
one
local
financial
operator
who
has
spoken
with
the
company
about
the
plans
to
be
sure
this
year
pdvsa
has
made
payments
only
on
its
and
bonds
prompting
ratings
agencies
to
declare
the
company
and
venezuela
s
government
in
selective
default
the
drop
in
crude
prices
that
began
in
and
an
ensuing
decline
in
production
have
reduced
the
opec
nation
s
government
revenue
investors
believe
pdvsa
will
prioritize
the
bond
because
of
the
potential
implications
for
citgo
the
remaining
shares
in
the
refiner
are
already
pledged
to
russia
s
rosneft
as
collateral
on
a
billion
loan
and
it
is
also
under
threat
from
canadian
miner
crystallex
which
has
won
a
judge
s
authorization
to
seize
citgo
shares
to
collect
on
a
billion
award
stemming
from
a
nationalization
dispute
pdvsa
has
demonstrated
via
its
legal
efforts
a
strong
preference
to
maintain
ownership

citgo
