expanding ethanol sales would have limited u.s. market impact -analysts
chicago
reuters
the
trump
administration
s
plan
to
allow
sales
of
corn
ethanol
would
have
limited
impact
on
the
depressed
ethanol
market
with
record
supplies
and
prices
for
the
fuel
hovering
near
the
lowest
in
a
decade
analysts
said
president
donald
trump
announced
the
decision
last
week
ahead
of
a
campaign
trip
to
iowa
the
top
producer
of
corn
and
ethanol
with
elections
looming
trump
aimed
to
give
a
boost
to
corn
producers
in
the
farm
belt
who
helped
secure
his
narrow
election
victory
he
said
his
administration
would
allow
a
waiver
for
sales
of
which
was
banned
from
june
to
and
has
about
percent
more
ethanol
than
the
most
common
gasoline
formulation
the
cheaper
variety
is
not
allowed
in
some
states
during
the
summer
because
its
higher
alcohol
content
can
make
it
evaporate
more
quickly
in
warmer
temperatures
increasing
smog
oil
refiners
are
opposed
to
the
move
and
have
vowed
to
sue
arguing
that
only
congress
can
lift
the
ban
even
if
the
plan
moves
forward
by
next
summer
and
hundreds
of
mostly
small
and
rural
gasoline
station
chains
install
new
dispensers
to
sell
overall
sales
likely
would
increase
only
slightly
there
are
more
than
stations
with
pumps
that
can
dispense
according
to
the
renewable
fuels
association
trade
group
that
is
a
small
portion
of
the
estimated
stations
in
the
country
according
to
the
national
association
of
convenience
stores
rfa
said
the
number
of
stations
offering
could
double
to
around
by
late
to
early
or
percent
of
the
total
analysts
said
large
oil
refiners
were
unlikely
to
build
new
infrastructure
for
major
fuel
sellers
including
bp
exxon
mobile
corp
royal
dutch
shell
plc
and
valero
energy
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
mark
lytle
a
vice
president
at
pipeline
and
terminal
operator
pro
petroleum
said
his
company
would
consider
adding
ethanol
tank
storage
if
fueling
stations
start
demanding
more
of
the
biofuel
but
due
to
the
uncertainty
regarding
challenges
to
the
measure
expansions
in
the
were
unlikely
lytle
said
it
can
cost
to
add
fuel
pumps
tanks
and
other
equipment
investments
that
could
take
about
six
years
to
pay
off
with
sales
of
there
s
a
lot
of
capital
investment
that
s
required
lytle
said
it
s
simply
return
on
investment
can
i
sell
enough
to
pay
for
my
project
ethanol
makers
are
desperate
for
any
demand
boost
supplies
last
week
swelled
to
million
barrels
just
below
a
record
from
march
the
market
has
been
under
pressure
since
china
formerly
the
top
importer
of
ethanol
imposed
tariffs
on
shipments
as
part
of
the
trade
spat
morgan
analyst
ann
duignan
said
infrastructure
to
dispense
is
insufficient
the
likely
impact
on
ethanol
and
corn
demand
in
the
foreseeable
future
is
immaterial
in
our
view

casey

general
stores
inc
said
in
a
statement
that
it
would
expand
offerings
to
as
many
as
of
its
stores
over
the
next
few
years
the
sheetz
inc
gas
station
chain
will
add
pumps
at
each
of
the
to
new
stores
it
builds
annually
during
the
coming
years
said
michael
lorenz
vice
president
of
petroleum
supply
at
sheetz
sheetz
already
offers
at
of
its
locations
in
the
eastern
united
states
ethanol
prices
of
per
gallon
were
cents
cheaper
than
gasoline
on
monday
sheetz
sells
at
about
cents
less
than
regular
gasoline
the
consumer
is
sensitive
to
price
when
it
comes
to
gasoline
they
appreciate
being
offered
at
a
lower
price
