asian

slipped

as
worries
over
trade
disputes
a
possible

in
the
chinese

and
higher

tempered

percent
after
a
sizable
percent
decline
last

its
biggest
since
march
to
a
nadir
the
market
shakeout
has
been
blamed
on
a
series
of
factors
including
worries
about
the
impact
of
a
trade
war
a
spike
in
bond
yields
and
caution
ahead
of
the
earnings
season
although
selling
appeared
to
have
abated
on
friday
partly
after
chinese
trade
data
showed
strong
growth
in
september
many
investors
remained
cautious
some
people
say
markets
drew
comfort
from
china
s
exports
data
but
to
me
it
seems
so
obvious
the
numbers
were
inflated
by
ahead
of
the
introduction
of

fujito
said
the
trade
war
is
starting
to
take
a
toll
on

in

that

showed

the

rrr
as
downside
risks
from

tensions
with
the

remain
significant
also
starting
to
attract
wider
attention
saudi
arabia
doubled
down
on
pressure
from
the
west
on
the
disappearance
of
jamal
khashoggi
a
resident
and
washington
post
columnist
after
he
entered
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
on
president
donald
trump
has
threatened
severe
punishment
if
it
turns
out
khashoggi
was
killed
while
many
company
executives
have
cancelled
their
plans
to
attend
a
saudi
investor
conference
later
this
month
investors
suspect
the
latest
development
could
undermine
the
leadership
of

prince
mohammed
bin
salman
and
has
the
risk
of
eventually
destabilising
the

saudi

bouncing
back
from
friday
s
low
of
oil
prices
could
rise
to

worries
about
saudi
arabia

kazuhiko
fuji
senior
fellow
at

institute
of
economy
trade
and
industry
a
think
tank
affiliated
with
the
japanese
government
people
had
thought
the
saudis
will
make
up
for
fall
in
iran
s
output
if
they
are
starting
to
use
oil
as
their
weapon
that
will
be
a
whole
new
chapter
he
said
higher
oil
prices
could
boost
inflation
around
the
world
and
spark
rises
in
borrowing
costs
which
are
also
seen
hurting
weak
borrowers
especially
those
in
emerging
markets
although
the
yield
posted
its
first
major
fall
in
about
two
months
last

said
on

that
washington
wants

to
deter

in
future
trade
deals
including
with
japan
that
raised
worried
among
