it
s
tempting
to
look
at
the
relative
resilience
of
china
s
imports
of
major
commodities
in
september
and
conclude
that
the
world
s
economy
is
weathering
the
trade
dispute
with
the
united
states
quite
well
the
problem
with
this
view
is
that
while
the
trade
conflict
certainly
looms
as
an
issue
in
china
s
commodity
trade
it
s
not
yet
the
driving
factor
and
any
strength
or
weakness
in
various
imports
is
largely
a
result
of
different
dynamics
take
copper
for
example
where
imports
of
unwrought
metal
in
september
were
tonnes
up
percent
from
the
tonnes
in
august
to
the
highest
in
years
this
looks
like
an
extremely
strong
monthly
gain
and
would
seem
to
be
at
odds
with
the
narrative
of
a
loss
of
momentum
in
the
chinese
economy
as
trade
war
fears
escalate
but
the
main
driver
of
september
s
strong
result
is
as
a
result
of
a
crackdown
on
the
use
of
copper
scrap
part
of
government
efforts
to
limit
the
importation
of
waste
products
this
has
forced
china
s
smelters
to
turn
to
other
sources
of
the
industrial
metal
in
order
to
satisfy
demand
there
may
be
an
element
of
the
trade
dispute
with
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
insofar
as
beijing
has
imposed
a
percent
import
tax
on
scrap
imports
from
the
united
states
as
part
of
its
tariffs
measures
but
this
would
only
eliminate
a
small
amount
of
copper
scrap
from
the
overall
chinese
market
meaning
the
trade
war
has
yet
to
emerge
as
a
major
factor
in
the
copper
supply
and
demand
story
iron
ore
was
another
commodity
that
appeared
to
have
a
relatively
strong
september
with
imports
gaining
percent
from
the
prior
month
to
hit
million
tonnes
similar
to
copper
one
would
expect
that
iron
ore
would
be
vulnerable
to
trade
tensions
given
the
use
of
steel
in
many
of
china
s
manufactured
exports
it
appears
that
steel
mills
have
been
ramping
up
output
ahead
of
winter
production
curbs
which
has
in
turn
driven
demand
for
iron
coal
was
one
of
the
commodities
to
have
a
weaker
september
with
imports
dropping
percent
from
august
to
million
tonnes
but
this
was
likely
because
of
softer
energy
demand
in
the
season
between
summer
and
winter
peaks
crude
oil
imports
improved
a
touch
to
their
strongest
level
since
may
reaching
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
september
up
from
million
bpd
in
august
this
marginal
gain
came
as
refinery
runs
rose
and
refiners
also
looked
to
build
inventories
ahead
of
winter
one
factor
that
doesn
t
gain
as
much
attention
as
it
should
in
analysis
of
china
s
commodity
imports
is
price
while
price
isn
t
the
most
important
factor
it
does
often
help
explain
some
of
the
monthly
movements
in
commodity
imports
copper
imports
may
have
been
boosted
by
the
fact
that
at
the
time
when
cargoes
for
september
arrivals
were
being
arranged
london
prices
were
weak
with
the
close
of
a
tonne
on
marking
the
low
point
for
the
year
so
far
similarly
benchmark
iron
ore
as
assessed
by
argus
media
was
also
soft
in
august
falling
steadily
from
a
peak
early
in
the
month
before
starting
to
recover
again
in
the
last
couple
of
days
in
contrast
benchmark
australian
thermal
coal
prices
at
newcastle
port
were
close
to
year
highs
in
the
late
july
and
august
period
when
cargoes
for
september
were
being
booked
prices
rose
to
the
highest
in
more
than
six
years
in
late
july
and
remained
elevated
through
august
potentially
crimping
demand
for
imports
of
the
polluting
fuel
with
prices
having
dropped
recently
slipping
to
a
tonne
in
the
week
ended
it
s
possible
that
coal
imports
may
increase
in
coming
months
overall
china
s
commodity
imports
are
still
being
driven
by
factors
other
than
the
trade
dispute
but
this
remains
a
potential
in
the
months
ahead
the
problem
is
that
it
s
unlikely
to
have
the
same
impact
across
the
commodity
spectrum
as
some
imports
may
actually
gain
especially
if
the
government
takes
steps
to
boost
infrastructure
spending
in
order
to
shore
up
economic
growth
