asia
according
to
an
associated
press
report
on

citing
department

the

would
help
fossil
fuel
producers
ship
their

to
asia
and
circumvent
environmental
concerns
in
states
like
washington
oregon
and
california
that

build
new
coal
ports
in

s
in
our
interest
for
national
security
and
our

voort
said
the
president
and
secretary
are
committed
to
the
men

women
of

country
and
it

t
seen
any

any
move

would
be
welcome

association

represents
coal
mining
companies
the
development
of
an
export
terminal
in
the
pacific
northwest
of
the
united
states
would
significantly
enhance
allies

a
central
tenet

a
boost
the

with
plans
for
as
many
as
seven
terminals
on

books
a
decade
ago
five
of
those
projects
were
canceled
though
amid
