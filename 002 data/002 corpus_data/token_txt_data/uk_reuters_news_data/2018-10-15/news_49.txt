like
many
farmers
in
densely
populated
kisii
county
in
western
kenya
james
and
janet
torori
long
depended
on
bananas
maize
and
a
single
dairy
cow
for
food
and
income
like
everyone
else
around
here
we
have
relied
on
two
crops
to
support
our
family
and
it
has
not
been
easy
earning
a
decent
income
considering
that
what
we
have
been
producing
is
what
everyone
else
produces
james
torori
said
but
over
the
last
year
they
ve
found
another
promising
source
of
cash
using
green
electricity
from
a
local
solar
to
power
a
hatchery
and
raise
chicks
for
sale
as
part
of
the
kuka
poa
smart
poultry
in
swahili
project
they
now
earn
about
a
month
more
than
they
once
did
said
the
couple
from
kebaracho
village
solar
power
sufficient
to
run
businesses
as
well
as
lights
could
help
many
more
rural
people
across
east
africa
earn
a
better
living
say
officials
at
powerhive
a
microgrid
power
company
that
provided
the
kuka
poa
panels
but
installing
clean
power
requires
cash
and
for
that
the
company
is
turning
to
a
partnership
with
the
sun
exchange
a
south
solar
energy
financier
the
sun
exchange
runs
an
online
marketplace
for
solar
cells
where
investors
can
buy
solar
equipment
that
is
then
leased
to
rural
communities
to
help
them
run
businesses
as
the
businesses
make
a
profit
investors
get
a
rental
income
over
years
and
poor
communities
get
access
to
clean
energy
without
the
big
upfront
costs
often
associated
with
installing
renewable
energy
said
abe
cambridge
the
sun
exchange
s
ceo
investors
can
use
anything
from
credit
cards
to
cryptocurrencies
such
as
bitcoin
to
buy
solar
cells
with
transactions
managed
via
blockchain
he
said
with
cryptocurrencies
the
market
is
large
and
you
access
the
whole
world
since
you
are
using
the
internet
and
the
investor
can
put
in
as
little
as
which
may
not
be
possible
in
traditional
markets
cambridge
explained
since
it
was
founded
in
the
company
has
raised
about
via
the
model
to
fund
five
projects
in
south
africa
generating
a
total
of
kilowatts
of
power
it
has
sold
over
solar
cells
to
more
than
buyers
in
countries
cambridge
said
one
project
powers
the
cape
town
offices
of
southsouthnorth
a
south
environmental
group
what
is
fantastic
about
the
sun
exchange
model
is
that
it
benefits
us
as
the
recipient
of
power
and
it
benefits
the
people
buying
the
solar
cells
and
it
s
also
a
win
for
the
environment
said
carl
wesselink
of
southsouth
north
the
sun
exchange
s
model
of
financing
solar
he
said
could
help
drive
wider
installation
of
solar
panels
and
be
the
catalyst
required
for
realising
our
distributed
energy
revolution
cambridge
said
the
sun
exchange
s
new
partnership
with
powerhive
which
has
operated
in
kenya
since
would
aim
to
fund
about
solar
projects
and
then
hopefully
grow
from
there
he
said
he
hopes
to
raise
enough
cash
to
generate
up
to
kilowatts
of
new
clean
power
over
the
next
five
years
chris
honor
powerhive
s
ceo
said
his
aim
is
to
connect
about
new
households
to
power
by
the
end
of
the
combined
attraction
of
earning
an
income
and
helping
some
of
the
million
people
living
without
electricity
in
africa
should
draw
investors
particularly
those
who
want
to
be
part
of
the
energy
revolution
he
said
he
said
his
company
has
put
in
place
in
kenya
have
so
far
powered
things
such
as
hatcheries
and
welding
shops
commercial
uses
of
energy
rather
than
power
for
lights
and
charging
mobile
phones
according
to
william
brent
of
power
for
all
an
organisation
that
promotes
broader
access
to
clean
electricity
crowdsourcing
has
become
central
in
financing
energy
projects
in
africa
and
asia
raising
millions
of
dollars
in
the
past
three
years
crowdsourcing
has
become
an
important
tool
for
many
companies
to
raise
capital
to
connect
people
to
electricity
for
the
first
time
he
said
several
platforms
are
now
offering
crowdfunding
for
clean
energy
and
that
will
continue
to
grow
and
to
explore
new
and
innovative
financing
models
he
predicted
such
methods
of
raising
funds
are
particularly
important
when
many
investors
are
still
learning
to
fully
embrace
the
energy
systems
of
the
future
