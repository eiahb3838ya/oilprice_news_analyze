japan's kyushu elec restricts renewable energy supplies for first time

japan
s
kyushu
electric
power
co
said
on
monday
it
restricted
solar
power
supplies
over
the
weekend
marking
the
first
time
a
japanese
utility
has
curbed
the
use
of
renewable
energy
to
avoid
a
sudden
blackout
the
move
underscores
the
need
for
the
country
to
boost
its
transmission
capacity
between
regions
to
allow
it
take
full
advantage
of
the
growth
in
renewable
energy
in
the
wake
of
the
fukushima
nuclear
disaster
in
the
fukushima
disaster
prompted
a
shift
toward
renewable
energy
backed
by
mandatory
preferential
rates
for
solar
wind
and
other
supplies
however
the
government
changed
regulations
in
allowing
the
old
utilities
which
control
the
country
s
transmission
grids
to
restrict
supplies
of
renewable
energy
from
solar
or
wind
farms
if
needed
to
maintain
grid
stability
kyushu
japan
s
utility
by
sales
said
in
august
that
the
restart
of
a
fourth
nuclear
reactor
could
lead
to
possible
restrictions
on
the
purchase
of
renewable
energy
the
curtailment
can
be
made
at
short
notice
and
without
having
to
pay
compensation
however
the
restrictions
can
only
be
made
after
first
curbing
hydro
and
fossil
fuel
power
output
or
transferring
excess
supplies
to
other
regions
solar
power
has
grown
fast
on
the
island
of
kyushu
but
the
unstable
output
during
the
day
depends
on
weather
patterns
and
can
create
a
headache
for
kyushu
electric
to
stabilise
the
grid
kyushu
had
gigawatts
of
solar
capacity
connected
to
the
grid
at
just
shy
of
the
gigawatts
that
a
government
committee
estimated
in
would
be
the
maximum
the
utility
could
take
without
curtailment
