asian
shares
slipped
on
monday
as
worries
over
trade
disputes
a
possible
slowdown
in
the
chinese
economy
and
higher
borrowing
costs
tempered
optimism
despite
a
rebound
in
global
equities
late
last
week
not
helping
the
mood
oil
prices
jumped
and
saudi
arabian
shares
tumbled
on
rising

msci
s

was
off
percent
after
a
sizable
percent
decline
last
week
to
a
nadir
and
marking
its
biggest
weekly
fall
since
march
the
market
shakeout
has
been
blamed
on
a
series
of
factors
including
worries
about
the
impact
of
a
trade
war
a
spike
in
bond
yields
this
week
and
caution
ahead
of
earnings
season
although

appeared
to
have
abated
on
friday
partly
after
chinese
trade
data
showed
strong
growth
in
september
many
investors
remained
cautious
some
people
say
markets
drew
comfort
from
china

data

significant
rises
in
borrowing
costs
are
also
seen
hurting
weak
borrowers
especially
those
in
emerging
markets
although
the

posted
its
first
major
fall
in
about
two
months
last
