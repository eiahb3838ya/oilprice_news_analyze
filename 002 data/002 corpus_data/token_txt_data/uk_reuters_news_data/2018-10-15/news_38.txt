column-oil prices ease as funds continue profit-taking: kemp
london
reuters
hedge
fund
managers
have
continued
to
take
profits
on
their
bullish
positions
in
crude
oil
as
the
late
summer
rally
has
faded
and
fears
about
oil
consumption
and
the
state
of
the
economy
have
replaced
concerns
over
sanctions
on
iran
fund
managers
cut
their
combined
net
long
position
in
the
six
most
important
petroleum
futures
and
options
contracts
by
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
after
trimming
it
by
million
barrels
the
week
before
liquidation
was
concentrated
in
brent
million
barrels
and
wti
million
while
fund
managers
left
positions
unchanged
in
heating
oil
and
added
them
in
gasoline
million
and
european
gasoil
million
net
positions
in
brent
and
wti
have
been
cut
by
a
total
of
million
barrels
over
the
last
two
weeks
after
being
raised
by
million
during
the
five
previous
weeks
chartbook
the
earlier
bullishness
was
driven
mostly
by
concerns
about
a
possible
shortage
of
crude
oil
once
sanctions
on
iran
go
into
effect
from
early
november
but
in
recent
weeks
saudi
arabia
russia
and
some
other
oil
producers
have
pledged
to
boost
their
oil
output
to
make
up
for
any
shortfall
and
stop
prices
spiralling
higher
more
importantly
and
possibly
in
response
to
the
surge
in
oil
prices
the
government
has
indicated
it
may
show
some
flexibility
to
allow
refiners
to
continue
purchasing
some
iranian
oil
portfolio
managers
remain
relatively
bullish
on
brent
with
net
length
of
million
barrels
reflecting
lingering
concerns
about
the
impact
of
sanctions
on
the
availability
of
seaborne
crude
as
well
as
the
strength
in
global
consumption
but
net
long
positions
in
nymex
and
ice
wti
have
been
cut
to
just
million
barrels
the
lowest
level
for
almost
a
year
reflecting
the
plentiful
supply
of
inland
crude
in
the
united
states
overall
hedge
fund
managers
remained
bullish
with
almost
bullish
long
positions
for
every
short
bearish
position
across
the
six
major
contracts
however
the
ratio
is
down
from
more
than
a
fortnight
earlier
potential
sanctions
waivers
as
well
as
concern
about
consumption
and
the
health
of
the
global
economy
have
tempered
the
earlier
bullishness
about
prices
and
encouraged
funds
to
adopt
a
more
cautious
stance
