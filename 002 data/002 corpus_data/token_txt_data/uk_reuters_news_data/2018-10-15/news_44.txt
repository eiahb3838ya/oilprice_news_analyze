germany
s
second
largest

refiner

said
on
monday
it
expects
to
plunge
into
the

because
of
continued
low
sugar
prices
following
eu

deregulation
unlisted
nordzucker
said
its
net
profit
tumbled
percent
in
the
six
months
to
from
a
year
earlier
to
million
euros
million
sales
fell
percent
to
million
euros
a
loss
is
now
inevitable
for
the
nordzucker
group
in
the
current
financial
year
due
to
the
low
sugar
prices
nordzucker
said
in
a
statement
given
the
anticipated
prices
an
even
more
substantial
loss
is
to
be
expected
in
the
next
financial
the
eu
liberalised
its
sugar
market
in
september
ending
its
system
of
guaranteed
minimum
prices
and
protected
production
quotas
and
giving
producers
freedom
to
expand
and
export
more
and
linking
eu
prices
to
world
markets
but
a
scenario
has
emerged
with
european
producers
exposed
to
global
prices
which
hit
lows
in
september
in
an
oversupplied
world
market
germany
s
largest
sugar
producer
suedzucker
has
also
warned
its
earnings
will
fall
because
of
low
sugar
prices
the
main
reason
for
the
decline
in
business
was
a
significant
drop
in
selling
prices
for
sugar
nordzucker
said
we
expected
prices
to
the
extent
of
this
decline
was
driven
by
overproduction
and
subsidies
particularly
in
meanwhile
dry
hot
weather
in
germany
and
elsewhere
in
europe
this
autumn
has
hindered
the
start
of
this
year
s
sugar
beet
harvest
this
year
s
harvest
and
beet
processing
which
started
in
will
be
affected
by
the
unusually
dry
weather
conditions
nordzucker
added
because
of
these
conditions
the
campaign
got
off
to
a
late
start
in
several
regions
compared
to
the
previous
year
and
is
expected
to
end
in
great
regional
yield
disparities
are
anticipated
