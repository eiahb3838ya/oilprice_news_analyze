turkey
and
italy
are
the
last
buyers
of
iranian
crude
outside
china
india
and
the

according
to
tanker
data
and
an
industry
source
the
latest
sign
that
shipments
are
taking
a
major
hit
from
looming
sanctions
the
islamic
republic
has
exported
million
barrels
per
day
so
far
in
october
to
india
china
turkey
and
the
middle
east
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
data
no
vessels
are
shown
heading
to
europe
with
iranian
crude
however
an
industry
source
who
also
tracks
the
exports
estimated
shipments
at
million
bpd
including
vessels
which
are
not
showing
on
ais
satellite
tracking
of
which
a
tanker
is
going
to
italy
that
s
down
from
at
least
million
bpd
in
april
before
president
donald
trump
in
may
withdrew
the
united
states
from
a
nuclear
deal
with
iran
and
reimposed
sanctions
the
figures
also
mark
a
further
fall
from
million
bpd
in
september
the
expected
loss
of
a
sizeable
amount
of
iranian
supply
has
helped
drive
a
rally
in
oil
prices
which
on
hit
their
highest
since
late
at
a
barrel
crude
has
since
eased
to
although
analysts
say
the
iranian
export
drop
remains
supportive
it
s
one
of
the
reasons
why
prices
are
still
above
said
eugen
weinberg
analyst
at
commerzbank
the
october
figures
add
to
signs
that
buyers
are
sufficiently
wary
of
the
sanctions
to
stop
or
scale
back
their
iranian
crude
dealings
and
that
exports
are
falling
more
steeply
than
some
in
the
market
expected
for
sure
definitive
export
data
is
hard
to
uncover
tanker
schedules
are
often
adjusted
exports
vary
week
by
week
and
the
tracking
of
tankers
while
easier
than
in
the
past
due
to
satellite
information
remains
both
art
and
science
in
the
first
week
of
october
iran
s
crude
exports
averaged
million
bpd
according
to
refinitiv
and
less
than
million
bpd
according
to
another
industry
source
while
washington
has
said
it
wants
to
cut
iran
s
oil
exports
to
zero
iran
and
saudi
arabia
say
that
is
unlikely
to
happen
the
trump
administration
is
considering
waivers
on
sanctions
for
countries
that
are
reducing
their
imports
india
a
major
buyer
has
ordered
iranian
oil
for
november
iran
which
has
pledged
to
block
any
opec
supply
increase
that
the
country
deems
to
be
against
its
interests
says
it
has
found
new
buyers
for
its
oil
and
its
crude
output
has
fallen
only
slightly
for
september
iran
told
opec
its
crude
output
dropped
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
while
consultants
and
government
agencies
that
opec
uses
to
monitor
production
reported
a
larger
fall
to
million
bpd
indeed
iran
may
not
yet
have
cut
production
to
match
the
rate
of
decline
in
its
exports
as
the
country
appears
to
be
storing
more
oil
on
ships
as
it
did
during
sanctions
that
applied
until
the
nuclear
deal
