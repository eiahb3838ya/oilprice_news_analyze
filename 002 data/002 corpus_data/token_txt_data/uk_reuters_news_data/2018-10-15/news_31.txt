world
markets
turned
tail
again
on
monday
as
a
bounceback
in
oil
prices
and
rising
tensions
between
western
powers
and
saudi
arabia
added
to
a
cocktail
of
concerns
that
battered
global
stocks
last
week
japan
s
nikkei
and
china
s
main
bourses
tumbled
overnight
as
trade
concerns
persisted
and
europe
s
stoxx
index
hit
a
low
as
markets
a

lower
after
their
worst
week
since

the
lack

continued
to
boost
traditional
safe
haven
assets
the
yen
and
swiss
franc
both
made
ground
on
a
subdued
dollar
in
the
currency
markets
while
gold
hit
its
highest
since
the
end
of
july
germany
s

also
rallied
and
the
euro
climbed
as
high
as
despite
a
humbling
regional
election
result
for
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
conservative
bavarian
allies
on
sunday
i
don
t
think
there
is
really
any
appetite
to
dive
back
in
to
stocks
and
the
saudi
situation
is
just
another
ball
for
investors
to
have
to
juggle
said
cmc
markets
senior
analyst
michael
hewson
if
the
trend
we
saw
last
week
continues
it
is
going
to
be
very
hard
for
europe
to
rally
the
outlook
remains
very
uncertain
hewson
added
the
unexplained
disappearance
from
the
saudi
embassy
in
istanbul
of
prominent
saudi
journalist
and
dissident
jamal
khashoggi
remained
in
the
headlines
as
saudi
king
salman
ordered
an
internal
probe
into
the
case
president
donald
trump
said
meanwhile
that
he
had
spoken
with
king
salman
about
khashoggi
and
that
he
was
sending
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
to
meet
the
king
immediately
over
the
weekend
trump
had
promised
severe
punishment
if
it
turned
out
the
journalist
a
resident
and
washington
post
columnist
had
been
killed
the
official
saudi
press
agency
spa
then
quoted
an
unnamed
official
saying
the
kingdom
will
respond
with
greater
action
if
there
are
measures
and
that
its
economy
has
an
influential
and
vital
role
in
the
global
traders
read
that
as
meaning
driving
oil
prices
up
further
brent
crude
responded
by
jumping
percent
which
in
turn
saw
saudi
stocks
recover
the
full
percent
they
had
lost
on
sunday
when
the
diplomatic
tensions
flared
turkey
s
lira
was
another
big
riser
on
monday
jumping
percent
to
its
highest
since
after
trump
cheered
the
release
of
a
pastor
who
had
been
under
house
arrest
in
turkey
investors
hope
his
release
can
lead
to
an
improvement
in
strained
relations
the
lira
is
likely
to
benefit
at
least
modestly
during
the
period
between
now
and
the

meeting
of

saudi
