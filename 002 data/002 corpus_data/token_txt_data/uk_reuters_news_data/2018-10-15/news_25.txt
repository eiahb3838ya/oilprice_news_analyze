paris
reuters
the
united
states
still
aims
to
cut
iran
s
oil
sales
to
zero
and
does
not
expect
restored
oil
sanctions
against
tehran
to
have
a
negative
impact
on
a
market
that
is
and
balanced
a
senior
official
said
on
monday
special
envoy
for
iran
brian
hook
was
talking
to
reporters
after
a
visit
to
india
a
major
importer
of
iranian
oil
and
talks
with
officials
from
france
britain
and
germany
before
the
start
of
a
new
round
of
sanctions
on
the
three
european
countries
have
been
trying
to
save
the
nuclear
deal
between
tehran
and
multiple
global
powers
since
president
trump
announced
in
may
that
the
united
states
would
withdraw
from
the
pact
in
a
conference
call
from
luxembourg
where
hook
was
meeting
european
officials
he
said
that
iran
uses
oil
revenue
to
support
and
fund
terrorist
proxies
throughout
the
middle
east
and
that
the
goal
is
for
countries
to
cut
iranian
oil
imports
to
zero
as
quickly
as
possible
we
are
working
with
countries
that
are
reducing
their
imports
to
ensure
that
this
happens
he
said
hook
declined
to
answer
questions
on
possible
waivers
on
sanctions
for
countries
that
are
reducing
their
imports
but
said
the
is
confident
that
energy
markets
will
remain
stable
we
are
seeing
a
and
balanced
oil
market
right
now
we
should
focus
on
these
fundamentals
and
not
be
distracted
by
the
emotional
and
unbalanced
claims
coming
from
iran
opec
s
producer
has
repeatedly
said
that
its
oil
exports
can
not
be
reduced
to
zero
because
of
high
demand
in
the
market
washington
meanwhile
plans
to
continue
with
oil
producers
and
maintain
supply
our
crude
oil
production
increased
by
million
barrels
in
august
compared
to
one
year
ago
and
that
is
expected
to
continue
rising
by
as
much
as
million
barrels
a
day
within
the
next
year
he
said
hook
also
said
that
european
efforts
to
create
a
special
purpose
vehicle
for
trade
with
tehran
would
find
no
demand
because
more
than
foreign
firms
have
indicated
that
they
would
be
leaving
the
country
