on
however
the
global
market

ipos
has
been
hit
by
recent
turmoil
in
financial
markets
prompting
a
number
of
companies
to
put
listing
plans
on
hold
and
kazatomprom
s
plans
are
also
subject
to
market
conditions
the
ipo
is
part

kazatomprom
accounts
for
percent
of
the
world

seven
years
on
from

fukushima
nuclear
disaster
the
beaten
down
uranium
sector
is
attracting
interest
again
the
company
believes
that
the
supply
side
of
the
uranium
market
is
undergoing
a
structural
shift
following
a
prolonged
period
of
depressed
spot
prices
and
oversupply
underpinned
by
the
prevalence
of
legacy
contracts
the
majority
of
which
were
concluded
in
the
period
between
years
and
kazatomprom
said
on
monday
as
a
significant
portion
of
such
legacy
contracts
are
set
to
expire
in
early

likely
to
return

reactors
were
under
construction
in

at
the
end
of

added
kazakhstan
s
close
economic
links
with
russia
could
pose
risks
as
western
sanctions
imposed
on
russia
or
any
future
sanctions
could
have
an
adverse
effect
on
kazakhstan
s
economy
and
the
group
s
business
but
the
ipo
is
still
expected
to
be
keenly
awaited
it
kazatomprom
ipo
is
only
going
to
generate
further
interest
and
introduce
new
investors
