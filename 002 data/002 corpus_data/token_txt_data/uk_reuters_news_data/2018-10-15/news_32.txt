its

on
pricing
with
the

want
to
sell
it
at
market
price

and
natural
gas
corp
ltd
to
pick
up
a
stake
in
an
upcoming
exploration
and
lng

and
overseas
lng
terminals
under
the
initial
agreement
signed

rooms
for
evaluation
of
the
project

s
time
a
agreement
allows

project
in
addition
to
petronet
the
upstream
project
was
to
feed
into
a
million
tonnes
per
annum
lng
terminal
there
is
merit
in
the
project
and
we
are
considering
it
singh
said
adding
that
as
petronet
would
be
investing
in
the
project
it
would
have
to
make
economic
sense
qatar
is
looking
at
a
potentially
bigger
participation
by
indian
firms
and
wants
an
entire
consortium
of
companies
to
come
together
and
invest
in
the
gulf
