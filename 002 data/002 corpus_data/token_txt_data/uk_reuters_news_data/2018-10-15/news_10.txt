u.s. government, but not trump, can be sued over climate -judge
oct
reuters
a
group
of
young
americans
suing
the
federal
government
over
lack
of
action
to
fight
climate
change
can
proceed
with
their
lawsuit
but
president
donald
trump
can
not
be
named
as
a
defendant
a
federal
judge
ruled
on
monday
the
decision
by
district
judge
ann
aiken
in
eugene
oregon
came
just
days
before
the
case
is
scheduled
to
go
to
trial
in
federal
court
on
children
and
young
adults
who
were
between
eight
and
when
the
lawsuit
was
filed
in
against
the
obama
administration
accused
federal
officials
and
oil
industry
executives
of
violating
their
due
process
rights
by
knowing
for
decades
that
carbon
pollution
poisons
the
environment
but
doing
nothing
about
it
aiken
said
the
case
revealed
a
delicate
balance
of
power
between
the
judicial
and
other
government
agencies
the
judge
said
those
concerns
were
not
enough
to
warrant
a
dismissal
of
the
entire
case
but
she
concluded
that
the
inclusion
of
trump
as
the
sitting
president
violated
the
proper
separation
of
powers
the
lawsuit
still
includes
the
heads
of
other
agencies
the
potentially
case
is
one
of
a
handful
seeking
to
have
courts
address
global
warming
and
its
causes
the
justice
department
and
a
spokeswoman
for
the
young
people
did
not
immediately
return
a
request
for
comment
on
monday
s
decision
the
federal
government
in
a
court
filing
on
friday
asked
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
halt
the
case
while
it
is
seeking
review
by
the
supreme
court
the
young
adults
say
extreme
weather
events
such
as
flooding
caused
them
emotional
trauma
and
damages
to
their
health
safety
cultural
practices
food
security
and
economic
stability
the
government
argued
those
injuries
are
widespread
environmental
phenomena
affecting
all
other
humans
on
the
planet
and
said
the
issue
did
not
belong
in
court
the
federal
defendants
also
contended
that
letting
the
case
proceed
would
be
too
burdensome
would
unconstitutionally
pit
the
courts
against
the
executive
branch
and
would
require
improper
agency
by
forcing
officials
to
answer
questions
about
climate
change
aiken
in
her
monday
decision
rejected
those
arguments
saying
the
plaintiffs
had
offered
extensive
expert
declarations
to
link
their
injuries
to
fossil
climate
change
she
also
said
there
was
sufficient
evidence
that
government
actions
such
as
coal
leasing
oil
development
and
fossil
fuel
industry
subsidies
led
to
the
children
s
injuries
