said
the
group
would
urge
changes
that
could

the
rfs
to
refiners
including
potentially
placing
a
price
cap
on
the
blending
credits
at

the

rural
biofuel
plant
workers
and
managers
delivered
a
letter
to
president
donald
trump
on
wednesday
reminding
him
of
their
industry
s
economic
importance
to
the
nation
s
heartland
after
four
straight
years
of
declining
agricultural
income
your
steadfast
support
of
homegrown
biofuels
has
been
a
lifeline
for
the
farm
economy
the
group
wrote
we
ask
that
you
send
a
clear
and
final
signal
that
this
administration
will
no
longer
entertain
misleading
schemes
designed
to
kill
the
the
rfs
currently
requires
refiners
to
cover
the
cost
of
blending
increasing
volumes
of
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
fuel
each
year
to
prove
compliance
refiners
must
earn
or
purchase
tradable
blending
credits
known
as
rins
the
price
of
which
has
skyrocketed
in
recent
years
the
program
established
in
to
help
farmers
and
cut
petroleum
imports
has
been
an
economic
driver
in
such
as
iowa
but
merchant
refiners
say
the
increasing
compliance
costs
are
overly
burdensome
and
put
jobs
at
risk
pes
which
employs
more
than
people
in
the
key
electoral
state
of
pennsylvania
in
january
blamed
its
bankruptcy
on
the
costs
of
the
credits
reuters
reported
that
other
factors
may
also
have
played
a
role
in
its
bankruptcy
including
the
withdrawal
of
more
than
million
in
payments
from
the
company
by
its
investor
owners
the
company
s
financial
meltdown
has
heaped
pressure
on
the
white
house
and
lawmakers
to
address
biofuels
policy
last
week
president
donald
trump
waded
deeper
into
the
issue
when
he
told
rival
groups
gathered
at
the
white
house
that
he
supported
a
compromise
that
temporarily
caps
credit
prices
to
lower
refinery
costs
while
also
lifting
restrictions
on
blended
gasoline
to
boost
corn
growers
the
environmental
protection
agency
currently
limits
gasoline
to
percent
ethanol
during
the
summer
months
a
policy
intended
to
reduce
ozone
emissions
and
smog
during
the
peak
driving
season
like
past
efforts
to
overhaul
the
rfs
trump
s
proposal
faces
political
and
legal
challenges
from
ethanol
industry
advocates
that
worry
a
credit
price
cap
would
undermine
the
biofuels
program
another
white
house
meeting
initially
planned
for
this
week
to
further
discuss
the
idea
may
be
postponed
for
logistical
reasons
two
sources
said
in
the
meantime
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
the
