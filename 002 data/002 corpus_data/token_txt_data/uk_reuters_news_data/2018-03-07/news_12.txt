a
federal
appeals
court
on
wednesday
rejected
the
government
s
bid
to
halt
a
lawsuit
by
young
people
claiming
that
president
donald
trump
and
his
administration
are
violating
their
constitutional
rights
by
ignoring
the
harms
caused
by
climate
change
by
a
vote
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
san
francisco
said
the
administration
had
not
met
the
high
bar
under
federal
law
to
dismiss
the
oregon
lawsuit
which
was
originally
brought
in
against
the
administration
of
president
barack
obama
the
potentially
case
is
one
of
a
handful
seeking
to
have
courts
address
global
warming
and
its
causes
plaintiffs
now
aged
to
accused
federal
officials
and
oil
industry
executives
of
knowing
for
decades
that
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels
destabilize
the
climate
but
refusing
to
do
anything
about
it
they
said
this
has
deprived
them
of
their
due
process
rights
to
life
liberty
and
property
including
to
live
in
a
habitable
climate
district
judge
ann
aiken
in
eugene
oregon
in
november
refused
to
dismiss
the
lawsuit
saying
a
quick
dismissal
without
addressing
the
merits
could
sanction
the
government
s
alleged
knowing
decision
to
poison
the
in
seeking
to
overturn
that
ruling
the
government
said
letting
the
case
proceed
could
lead
to
burdensome
litigation
and
provoke
a
constitutional
crisis
by
pitting
courts
against
trump
and
the
many
other
executive
branch
officials
named
as
defendants
but
in
wednesday
s
decision
chief
judge
sidney
thomas
said
the
dismissal
request
was
premature
and
deciding
whether
the
plaintiffs
claims
were
too
broad
could
be
addressed
through
the
normal
legal
process
litigation
burdens
are
part
of
our
legal
system
and
the
defendants
still
have
the
usual
remedies
before
the
district
court
for
nonmeritorious
litigation
thomas
wrote
and
remedies
often
are
vastly
narrowed
as
litigation
proceeds
we
have
no
reason
to
assume
this
case
will
be
any
the
department
of
justice
which
handled
the
government
appeal
did
not
immediately
respond
to

director
of
our
children

trust
which
advocates
for
improving
the
climate
in
an
interview
welcomed
the
decision
it
s
very
exciting
she
said
it
will
be
the
first
time
that
climate
science
and
the
federal
government
s
role
in
creating
its
dangers

go
on
