ceraweek-u.s. shale and opec share steak in uneasy truce at houston dinner
houston
reuters
around
the
room
at
houston
s
the
grove
restaurant
on
monday
at
several
tables
sat
a
group
of
shale
executives
interspersed
with
energy
ministers
and
officials
representing
opec
members
where
they
dined
on
fish
and
steak
they
should
have
had
a
lot
to
discuss
amid
the
fervor
of
ceraweek
the
most
notable
energy
event
of
the
year
but
what
could
have
been
two
of
the
biggest
topics
of
conversation
oil
prices
and
opec
output
levels
were
not
in
the
cards
as
such
a
broad
conversation
would
run
afoul
of
antitrust
rules
against
it
was
quite
a
congenial
group
of
people
we
had
a
really
wonderful
conversation
said
tim
dove
ceo
of
pioneer
natural
resources
co
he
noted
that
mohammed
barkindo
opec
secretary
general
gave
a
speech
and
his
main
message
was
that
they
believe
very
strongly
that
demand
is
going
to
be
significant
moving
forward
in
terms
of
just
a
ago
such
a
gathering
would
have
been
difficult
the
two
sides
were
involved
in
a
price
war
that
left
many
shale
firms
bankrupt
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
pumped
from
pushing
down
the
oil
price
in
a
campaign
for
market
share
aimed
at
pushing
the
shale
industry
out
of
business
the
price
war
sparked
an
industry
recession
and
oil
prices
plunged
to
a
low
of
a
barrel
but
shale
cut
costs
and
survived
and
eventually
the
low
price
was
too
much
for
opec
members
to
bear
opec
cut
output
in
effectively
making
way
for
shale
since
then
there
has
been
an
uneasy
truce
between
opec
and
the
shale
industry
even
as
opec
ministers
sit
down
with
shale
executives
it
still
grates
for
them
that
they
have
had
to
cut
production
and
cede
market
share
to
oil
firms
that
pump
as
much
as
they
can
firms
can
not
engage
in
agreements
to
control
supply
or
push
up
prices
due
to
laws
in
the
united
states
but
shale
firms
are
enjoying
the
benefits
of
opec
members
doing
what
they
can
not
driving
production
to
a
record
in
late
at
more
than
million
barrels
a
day
occasionally
opec
ministers
show
signs
of
their
frustration
nigerian
oil
minister
emmanuel
ibe
kachikwu
told
reuters
on
monday
that
some
of
the
same
companies
that
are
working
in
shale
are
the
same
companies
working
in
opec
and
that
they
should
take
some
responsibilities
in
terms
of
stability
of
oil
at
the
same
industry
gathering
a
year
ago
saudi
arabia
s
oil
minister
said
his
country
should
not
have
to
underwrite
the
investments
of
others
but
both
opec
ministers
and
shale
executives
know
that
there
is
nothing
really
that
shale
firms
can
do
several
executives
in
houston
this
week
including
at
least
one
who
attended
monday
s
dinner
declined
to
discuss
the
the
dinner
was
just
generalizations
and
platitudes
said
mark
papa
ceo
of
centennial
resources
development
inc
who
also
attended
it
s
just
a
statement
that
everyone
will
work
together
to
make
sure
the
oil
market
is
and
everyone
is
happy
to
be
working
together
he
said
along
with
barkindo
ministers
from
qatar
united
arab
emirates
and
equatorial
guinea
were
in
attendance
the
key
thing
is
that
information
is
shared
about
our
projections
it
really
helps
everybody
gabriel
mbaga
obiang
lima
equatorial
guinea
s
petroleum
minister
told
reuters
of
the
discussion
at
the
dinner
which
he
attended
the
important
thing
is
to
know
how
much
they
shale
are
investing
and
their
projections
because
usually
they
have
good
statistics
he
said
what
we
are
doing
is
avoiding
but
conocophillips
ceo
ryan
lance
speaking
tuesday
at
the
conference
said
we
ve
just
decided
to
embrace
volatility
the
growth
in
the
is
coming
it
ll
probably
consume
most
of
the
incremental
demand
so
opec
is
needed
to
show
restraint
in
order
to
continue
to
balance
that
lance
was
one
of
at
least
five
executives
from
oil
companies
who
declined
invitations
to
attend
according
to
sources
familiar
at
those
companies
who
did
not
want
to
be
named
but
dove
said
barkindo
s
speech
at
the
dinner
suggests
an
understanding
of
the
shared
challenge
in
meeting
global
demand
it
s
the
shale
producers
it
s
the
opec
producers
it
s
the
producers
that
are
going
to
be
needed
to
make
sure
we
fill
that
demand
as
we
go
through
the
next
many
years
dove
said
from
that
standpoint
i
think
shale
has
an
important
role
to
play
and
i
think
that
