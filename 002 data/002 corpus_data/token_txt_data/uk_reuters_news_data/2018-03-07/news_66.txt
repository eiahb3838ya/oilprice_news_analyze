opec
and
its
allies
have
succeeded
in
eliminating
excess
oil
stocks
and
accelerating
the
recovery
in
prices
but
they
are
paying
an
increasingly
high
price
in
terms
of
market
share
producers
will
capture
all
the
growth
in
global
oil
consumption
this
year
according
to
forecasts
from
the
energy
information
administration
energy
outlook
eia
march
the
agency
predicts
total
crude
and
liquids
production
will
rise
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
over
the
same
period
global
consumption
is
expected
to
rise
by
just
million
bpd
ensuring
the
united
states
captures
all
of
the
demand
increase
this
year
surging
shale
production
is
starting
to
resemble
the
last
boom
when
production
rose
by
million
bpd
in
then
million
bpd
in
and
another
million
bpd
in
during
the
last
boom
producers
captured
most
of
the
increase
in
global
demand
pushing
the
market
towards
surplus
and
creating
conditions
for
the
subsequent
slump
in
prices
something
similar
could
happen
again
the
parallels
between
the
last
shale
boom
and
the
current
surge
are
uncomfortably
close
and
the
bad
news
for
opec
does
not
stop
there
the
latest
forecasts
from
the
international
energy
agency
iea
show
shale
and
other
producers
outside
the
agreement
capturing
all
the
growth
in
global
oil
demand
through
the
end
of
the
decade
global
consumption
is
forecast
to
increase
by
a
total
of
million
bpd
between
and
according
to
the
iea
oil
analysis
and
forecasts
to
iea
march
but
oil
production
is
predicted
to
increase
by
almost
million
barrels
over
the
same
period
while
output
from
brazil
adds
another
bpd
rising
production
from
the
united
states
brazil
canada
and
norway
all
of
them
outside
the
agreement
will
ensure
the
global
market
remains
well
supplied
through
as
a
result
demand
for
opec
crude
is
set
to
dip
slightly
in
recover
in
then
dip
again
in
the
iea
says
according
to
the
agency
s
market
forecast
there
will
be
no
sustained
increase
in
demand
for
opec
crude
until
at
least
or
even
that
outlook
may
be
too
optimistic
for
opec
the
iea
may
be
production
and
global
consumption
both
of
which
could
lower
demand
for
opec
crude
compared
with
the
baseline
the
iea
forecasts
for
shale
production
are
conditioned
on
the
current
forward
price
curve
which
shows
brent
prices
falling
to
per
barrel
by
however
the
oil
industry
is
cyclical
if
prices
rise
rather
than
fall
in
the
next
few
years
shale
production
could
grow
even
faster
than
the
iea
predicts
and
demand
for
opec
crude
would
be
correspondingly
lower
opec
itself
shows
every
indication
of
trying
to
raise
oil
prices
further
by
reducing
its
target
for
global
oil
inventories
and
maintaining
its
output
cuts
which
threatens
to
accelerate
shale
production
even
more
on
the
demand
side
any
forecast
must
take
into
account
the
macroeconomic
cycle
and
possibility
of
a
slowdown
in
the
united
states
china
or
the
world
economy
at
some
point
in
the
next
five
years
the
iea
s
consumption
forecast
which
is
based
on
gdp
projections
from
the
imf
assumes
global
economic
growth
will
remain
steady
at
around
percent
per
year
through
but
the
economic
expansion
is
already
the
on
record
and
if
it
continues
will
become
the
in
may
and
the
longest
in
july
most
cyclical
indicators
including
unemployment
capacity
utilisation
wages
prices
and
credit
markets
suggest
the
expansion
in
the
united
states
and
other
oecd
economies
is
now
fairly
mature
to
assume
the
global
economy
will
continue
growing
steadily
for
another
five
years
is
therefore
fairly
risky
and
could
prove
for
the
last
years
opec
s
production
policy
under
the
de
facto
leadership
of
saudi
arabia
has
alternated
between
supporting
prices
and
defending
market
share
in
an
ideal
world
opec
would
like
to
protect
both
but
in
practice
the
two
objectives
are
in
tension
with
one
another
between
and
early
opec
focused
on
supporting
prices
despite
losing
market
share
to
shale
firms
starting
in
june
and
lasting
through
june
the
organisation
switched
to
focus
on
protecting
and
rebuilding
market
share
allowing
prices
to
collapse
since
december
opec
and
it
s
allies
have
reverted
to
price
defence
accepting
a
reduction
in
their
market
share
again
opec
policy
is
cyclical
so
at
some
point
the
focus
will
revert
to
market
share
when
the
loss
of
customers
becomes
too
painful
but
there
are
several
reasons
to
think
the
switch
might
be
delayed
this
time
around
opec
has
always
been
slow
to
react
to
changing
market
conditions
after
previous
price
slumps
the
organisation
allowed
the
market
to
tighten
too
much
rather
than
risk
not
tightening
it
enough
by
allowing
prices
to
rise
too
far
for
too
long
opec
has
normally
created
conditions
for
the
next
downturn
at
the
moment
however
the
current
strategy
is
still
paying
dividends
for
the
organisation
s
members
including
saudi
arabia
higher
prices
are
more
than
offsetting
the
loss
of
sales
volumes
so
there
is
no
pressure
to
switch
course
more
importantly
the
kingdom
seems
to
want
a
high
and
rising
oil
price
to
provide
a
favourable
backdrop
and
maximise
the
valuation
for
the
sale
of
shares
in
aramco
later
this
year
or
in
it
is
very
questionable
whether
either
the
current
spot
price
of
oil
or
forward
curve
is
strictly
relevant
to
the
valuation
of
aramco
the
company
has
proved
reserves
equivalent
to
almost
years
of
production
at
the
current
rate
statistical
review
of
world
energy
bp
the
company
s
valuation
therefore
depends
on
a
view
of
oil
prices
through
multiple
cycles
rather
than
the
current
price
as
well
as
its
tax
treatment
and
other
factors
but
senior
policymakers
seem
to
have
become
convinced
price
dynamics
do
in
fact
matter
for
valuation

the

may
be
distorting

political

to

sacrifice
too
