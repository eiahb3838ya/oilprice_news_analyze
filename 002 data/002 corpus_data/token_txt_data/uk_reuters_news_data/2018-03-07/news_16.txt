over
prince
mohammed
s
trip
which
was
aimed
at
building
a
broader
economic

between
the
two
countries
but
has
sparked
anger
about
alleged
human
rights
abuses
and
the
war
in
yemen
the
link
that
we
have
with
saudi
arabia
is
historic

an
important
one
and
it
has
saved
the
lives
of
potentially
hundreds
of
people
in
this
country
may
said
pausing
her
answer
briefly
as

lawmakers
cried
shame
she
was
alluding
to
on
islamist
militant
suspects

britain
is
looking
for
trading

it
exits
the
european
union
and
energy
powerhouse
saudi
arabia
needs
to
convince
sceptical
investors
about
its
domestic
reforms
this
is
a
significant
boost
for
uk
prosperity
and
a
clear
demonstration
of
the
strong
international
confidence
in
our
economy
as
we
prepare
to
leave
the
european
union

be
welcomed
in
britain

hassan
yassine
a

service

day
every
single
second
even
as
