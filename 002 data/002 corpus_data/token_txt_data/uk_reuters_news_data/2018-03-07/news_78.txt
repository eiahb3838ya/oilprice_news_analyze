investors bet on component makers in electric car shift
london
reuters
as
carmakers
ramp
up
spending
on
and
electric
vehicles
evs
many
investors
are
betting
their
component
suppliers
will
be
the
first
winners
from
the
technology
shifts
asked
how
they
are
positioning
for
the
changes
investors
interviewed
by
reuters
more
often
mentioned
suppliers
like
aptiv
valeo
and
continental
than
the
big
car
brands
building
them
such
as
volkswagen
daimler
and
peugeot
that
partly
reflects
a
shift
toward
more
complex
vehicles
where
components
makers
are
contributing
an
proportion
of
a
car
s
total
value
it
is
also
an
acknowledgement
that
the
big
innovations
are
happening
as
much
in
the
auto
industry
s
scattered
supply
base
as
in
the
design
hubs
of
the
big
carmakers
also
known
as
original
equipment
manufacturers
oems
we
feel
the
structural
growth
opportunities
and
visibility
in
the
suppliers
is
higher
than
for
the
oems
where
more
uncertainties
exist
debt
is
higher
and
typically
lower
said
marcus
european
equities
portfolio
manager
at
allianz
gi
his
allianz
continental
european
fund
s
main
exposure
to
the
ev
trend
is
through
german
semiconductor
maker
infineon
which
represents
percent
of
the
fund
along
with
tyres
and
parts
supplier
continental

well
as
swedish

safety
equipment
maker
autoliv
and
aptiv
the
former
delphi
businesses
now
focused
on
networked
ev
architecture
those
companies
providing
technology
which
supports
an
autonomous
connected
shared
and
electric
transportation
system
are
well
positioned
to
experience
heightened
levels
of
profitable
growth
over
the
long
term
said
fitzgerald
while
a
european
index
of
auto
stocks
is
down
percent
this
year
that
is
less
than
the
broader
stoxx
s
percent
drop
and
places
it
among
the
european
sectors
so
far
in
for
carmakers
the
shift
to
evs
carries
huge
costs
and
risks
with
many
slashing
billions
from
their
cost
base
to
help
offset
the
lower
profitability
of
electric
cars
even
premium
manufacturers
with
the
highest
profit
margins
are
bracing
for
some
pain
daimler
says
it
will
face
a
significantly
lower
margin
in
the
beginning
of
the
cycle
for

with
governments
stepping
up
efforts
to
reduce
pollution
carmakers
plan
to
plough
at
least
billion
globally
into
evs
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
much
of
this
has
been
driven
by
strict
quotas
that
china
the
world
s
largest
auto
market
has
set
for
vehicles
nevs
and
which
are
coming
into
force
in
we
have
strongly
increased
our
exposure
to
this
theme
as
we
now
believe
that
evs
are
in
a
position
to
become
competitive
in
less
than
five
years
said
lyxor
asset
management
s
head
of
global
equities
fabrice
theveneau
he
expects
parts
makers
to
sell
more
products
to
oems
which
he
believes
will
be
net
losers
from
the
ev
shift
losing
market
share
to
new
competitors
such
as
tesla
and
facing
heavy
costs
to
transform
their
industrial
base
some
investors
are
wary
of
the
high
valuation
of
many
tech
stocks
infineon
rose
percent
and
stmicroelectronics
percent
last
year
before
mass
adoption
has
even
begun
lyxor
s
theveneau
instead
favors
tyremakers
continental
pirelli
and
michelin
as
he
expects
demand
for
premium
tyres
to
pick
up
as
the
average
ev
will
drive
further
than
a
conventional
car
he
also
owns
shares
in
battery
material
miners
glencore
eramet
and
covestro
as
well
as
industrial
gas
makers
linde
and
air
liquide
both
plays
that
offer
him
an
option
on
the
success
of
hydrogen
cars
a
rival
technology
to
ev
theveneau
still
has
carmakers
renault
nissan
and
toyota
among
his
top
picks
it
s
a
race
some
of
the
market
shares
will
change
you
don
t
know
who
is
going
to
win

the
wesley
lebeau
who
manages
a
fund
at
amundi
s
cpr
asset
management
is
also
looking
along
the
ev
supply
chain
umicore
is
one
of
his
top

thanks
to
its
dominant
position
in

gavin

senior

manager
in
the

team
at

is
staying
positive
on
the
german
automakers
in
particular
saying
they
will
aim
to
claw
back
market
share
in
premium
evs
from
electric
car
trailblazer
tesla
he
says
the
german
car
manufacturers
tend
to
be
better
funded
than
rivals
and
have
spent
more
on
research
and
development
over
the
years
he
holds
a
position
in
daimler
which
last
month
unveiled
a

i

pretty
convinced
that
when
mercedes
starts
launching
electric

that
look
like
mercedes
that
feel
like

they
will
have
a
decent
place
in
