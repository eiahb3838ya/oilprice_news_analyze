adds
nigerian
response
lagos
march
reuters
the
international
monetary
fund
said
on
wednesday
that
nigeria
was
slowly
exiting
recession
but
remains
vulnerable
because
its
growth
is
tied
to
oil
prices
and
improved
revenues
are
restricted
to
the
energy
and
agriculture
sectors
the
assessment
published
in
a
report
on
wednesday
came
in
the
imf
s
article
iv
consultation
an
annual
appraisal
of
a
country
s
economy
reuters
reported
on
the
lender
s
findings
last
week
after
seeing
a
copy
of
the
document
which
states
that
the
fund
expects
nigeria
s
government
to
muddle
through
in
the
medium
term
nigeria
emerged
in
the
second
quarter
of
from
its
first
recession
in
years
largely
caused
by
low
crude
prices
and
militant
attacks
on
energy
facilities
higher
oil
prices
and
an
end
to
the
attacks
mostly
account
for
the
end
of
the
recession
crude
oil
sales
make
up
around
of
government
revenue
and
the
majority
of
foreign
exchange
the
nigerian
economy
is
slowly
exiting
recession
but
remains
vulnerable
the
imf
said
in
its
report
it
said
the
economy
had
been
helped
by
higher
oil
prices
improved
access
to
foreign
exchange
and
foreign
reserves
rising
to
a
high
but
the
improvements
have
not
yet
boosted
activity
it
said
lower
oil
prices
tighter
external
market
conditions
heightened
security
issues
and
delayed
policy
responses
are
the
main
downside
risks
it
said
in
the
imf
s
summary
of
the
government
s
response
to
the
report
unidentified
nigerian
authorities
wished
to
register
their
displeasure
with
the
phrase
muddle
through
and
failure
to
appreciate
government
efforts
despite
several
initiatives
to
strengthen
the
fiscal
situation
and
promote
the
government
also
complained
that
the
imf
had
highlighted
nigeria
s
endemic
corruption
they
find
the
reference
to
corruption
in
nigeria
inappropriate
given
that
corruption
is
relative
across
the
globe
the
imf
said
going
forward
the
nigerian
authorities
request
staff
to
correct
the
errors
and
use
proper
phrases
to
reflect
actual
the
fund
s
report
also
repeated
its
calls
for
nigeria
to
lift
its
remaining
foreign
exchange
restrictions
and
scrap
its
system
of
multiple
exchange
rates
the
imf
has
for
more
than
a
year
called
for
nigeria
to
simplify
its
complex
foreign
exchange
system
used
to
reduce
the
impact
of
dollar
shortages
which
has
left
large
gaps
between
official
rates
and
various
windows
that
certain
groups
can
use
for
access
to
other
rates
the
report
said
the
fund
recommends
removing
multiple
currency
practices
and
unifying
the
exchange
rate
as
quickly
as
possible
it
said
the
move
would
increase
confidence
remove
market
distortions
and
increase
transparency
nigeria
s
gross
domestic
product
grew
percent
in
after
shrinking
percent
in
which
was
its
first
annual
contraction
in
years
under
the
baseline
scenario
growth
would
pick
up
to
percent
in
from
percent
in
helped
by
the
full
year
impact
of
greater
fx
availability
and
recovering
oil
production
the
fund
said
in
the
report
the
fund
s
growth
projection
is
unchanged
from
an
estimate
announced
by
the
lender
in
december
