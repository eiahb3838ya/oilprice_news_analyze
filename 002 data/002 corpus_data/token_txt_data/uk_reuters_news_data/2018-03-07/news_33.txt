european
power
grid
lobby
urged
serbia
and
kosovo
to
urgently
resolve
a
dispute
over
their
power
grid
which
has
affected
the
broader
european
network
causing
some
digital
clocks
on
the
continent
to
lose
time
the
grid
shared
by
serbia
and
its
former
province
kosovo
is
connected
to
europe
s
synchronized
high
voltage
power
network
which
represents
european
electricity
transmission
operators
said
the
continental
network
had
lost
gwh
of
energy
since
because
kosovo
had
been
using
more
electricity
than
it
generates
serbia
which
is
responsible
for
balancing
kosovo
s
grid
had
failed
to
do
so
said
the
loss
of
energy
had
meant
that
electric
clocks
that
are
steered
by
the
frequency
of
the
power
system
rather
than
by
a
quartz
crystal
to
lag
nearly
six
minutes
behind
said
many
digital
clocks
such
as
those
in
alarm
clocks
and
in
ovens
or
microwaves
use
the
frequency
of
the
power
grid
to
keep
time
the
problem
emerges
when
the
frequency
drops
over
a
sustained
period
of
time
said
the
european
network
s
frequency
had
deviated
from
its
standard
of
hertz
hz
to
hz
since
resulting
in
gwh
of
lost
energy
although
it
had
appeared
to
be
returning
to
normal
on
tuesday
deviation
stopped
yesterday
after
kosovo
took
some
steps
but
it
will
take
some
time
to
get
the
system
back
to
normal
spokeswoman
susanne
nies
told
reuters
she
said
the
risk
could
remain
if
there
is
no
political
solution
to
the
problem
the
political
dispute
centres
mainly
on
regulatory
issues
and
a
row
between
serbia
and
kosovo
over
grid
operation
it
is
further
complicated
by
the
fact
that
belgrade
still
does
not
recognise
kosovo
we
will
try
to
fix
the
technicalities
by
the
end
of
this
week
but
the
question
of
who
will
compensate
for
this
loss
has
to
be
answered
nies
said
urged
european
governments
and
policymakers
to
take
swift
action
and
exert
pressure
on
kosovo
and
serbia
to
resolve
the
issue
which
is
also
hampering
integration
of
the
western
balkans
energy
market
required
by
the
european
union
these
actions
need
to
address
the
political
side
of
this
issue
said
in
a
statement
serbian
grid
operator
ems
said
in
a
statement
that
it
has
committed
all
its
resources
to
resolving
this
issue
in
a
swift
and
efficient
manner
kosovo
s
grid
operator
kostt
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
kosovo
seceded
from
serbia
in
both
states
want
to
join
the
european
union
but
brussels
says
they
must
normalize
relations
to
forge
closer
ties
with
the
bloc
serbia
and
kosovo
signed
an
agreement
on
operating
their
power
grid
in
however
it
has
not
been
implemented
yet
as
they
can
not
agree
on
power
distribution
in
kosovo
amid
conflicting
claims
about
ownership
of
the
grid
built
when
they
were
both
part
of
yugoslavia
