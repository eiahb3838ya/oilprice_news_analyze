rising
biodiesel
imports
from
argentina
and
an
expected
surge
in
shipments
from
indonesia
threaten
to
cripple
output
in
the
european
union
the
world
s
top
producer
of
the
renewable
fuel
the
european
union
slashed
import
duties
on
argentine
biodiesel
last
september
after
buenos
aires
mounted
a
successful
challenge
at
the
world
trade
organisation
weeks
after
the
united
states
imposed
steep
duties
on
the
fuel
the
bloc
is
now
considering
whether
to
cut
duties
on
indonesian
biodiesel
argentine
fuel
is
now
entering
the
eu
at
much
lower
prices
than
rapeseed
oil
the
main
material
used
by
european
producers
who
say
they
can
not
compete
and
in
some
cases
are
being
pushed
to
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
between
august
last
year
and
january
tonnes
of
biodiesel
around
four
times
the
capacity
of
a
large
eu
plant
worth
million
were
exported
from
argentina
to
the
bloc
customs
data
showed
earlier
in
nearly
all
exports
were
heading
to
the
united
states
raffaello
garofalo
head
of
the
european
biodiesel
board
ebb
said
the
impact
of
argentine
imports
was
already
worse
than
expected
there
is
huge
economic
damage
and
we
risk
seeing
many
european
renewable
fuel
producers
close
down
in
the
face
of
these
unfair
import
floods
he
said
the
eu
is
the
world
s
largest
producer
and
consumer
of
biodiesel
a
fuel
made
mostly
from
vegetable
oils
which
is
renewable
and
aimed
at
reducing
carbon
emissions
eu
production
of
biodiesel
was
million
tonnes
in
up
from
million
a
year
earlier
but
consultancy
strategie
grains
which
initially
said
output
would
be
stable
this
year
has
cut
its
estimate
to
million
tonnes
because
of
the
argentine
imports
imports
of
argentine
biodiesel
into
the
eu
could
hit
million
tonnes
in
with
a
similar
volume
from
indonesia
if
the
eu
cuts
its
duties
strategie
grains
said
the
rise
in
imports
comes
as
several
producers
in
the
european
union
are
being
pressed
hard
by
internal
competition
and
low
margins
the
eu
s
top
producer
saipol
part
of
oilseed
group
avril
said
it
would
cut
production
by
nearly
half
this
year
with
around
out
of
staff
working
reduced
hours
mainly
because
of
imports
of
argentine
biodiesel
there
is
a
double
impact
on
our
sales
but
also
on
the
biodiesel
market
where
prices
are
weighed
down
by
the
arrival
of
cheap
products
kristell
guizouarn
head
of
france
s
biodiesel
industry
group
esterifrance
said
both
argentina
and
indonesia
impose
a
higher
export
duty
on
the
raw
material
soybeans
and
palm
oil
respectively
than
on
biodiesel
this
allows
biodiesel
producers
in
the
two
countries
to
dump
products
abroad
at
unfairly
low
prices
eu
producers
say
since
september
european
rapeseed
biodiesel
prices
have
fallen
percent
but
are
still
about
percent
higher
than
argentine
soybean
biodiesel
delivered
to
the
bloc
the
eu
was
argentina
s
largest
biodiesel
market
until
the
tariffs
were
implemented
in
the
spanish
biodiesel
industry
could
be
hard
hit
there
would
be
no
need
to
produce
the
fuel
in
spain
if
cheap
biodiesel
is
available
from
argentina
said
christophe
cogny
analyst
at
strategie
grains
adding
that
spanish
companies
were
already
facing
severe
overcapacity
germany
the
eu
s
largest
producing
country
warned
of
a
massive
fall
in
output
this
year
due
to
what
it
called
unfairly
subsidized
imports
immediate
measures
should
be
taken
by
the
eu
to
restrain
the
imports
in
order
to
prevent
this
threat
to
the
very
existence
of
the
german
biodiesel
industry
elmar
baumann
head
of
the
german
biofuels
industry
association
vdb
said
the
eu
opened
an
investigation
into
argentine
biodiesel
at
the
end
of
january
after
a
complaint
by
the
ebb
potentially
offering
a
way
to
impose
duties
on
imported
biodiesel
argentine
producers
accused
the
eu
of
protectionism
we
are
confident
that
we
have
a
very
clear
and
strong
case
to
defend
ourselves
said
luis
zubizarreta
president
of
carbio
argentina
s
biofuels
industry
chamber
if
the
investigation
finds
that
argentina
benefited
from
unfair
subsidies
provisional
duties
could
be
imposed
late
this
year
the
scope
of
such
duties
is
unknown
in
the
meantime
pressured
by
the
industry
france
adopted
stricter
environmental
rules
for
imported
biofuels
a
measure
intended
to
restrict
inflows
from
argentina
but
since
most
shipments
enter
the
eu
via
the
netherlands
or
spain
and
are
then
distributed
internally
it
will
be
hard
to
track
the
impact
of
the
french
action
the
united
states
imposed
steep
duties
on
argentine
and
indonesian
biodiesel
last
august
saying
the
fuel
was
unfairly
subsidized
argentine
producers
said
the
move
meant
an
immediate
halt
in
exports
on
the
markets
and
last
month
the
commerce
department
imposed
more
import
duties
on
biodiesel
from
both
countries
making
it
virtually
certain
that
biodiesel
from
argentina
and
indonesia
will
not
be
sold
in
the
market
