as sanctions loom, venezuelan official seeks u.s. talks over utah man held prisoner
washington
march
reuters
a
venezuelan
state
governor
made
an
unusual
visit
to
washington
this
week
seeking
meetings
with
congress
members
to
discuss
the
fate
of
a
utah
man
imprisoned
in
the
south
american
nation
sources
said
on
wednesday
as
the
country
faces
a
possible
new
round
of
sanctions
rafael
lacava
the
governor
of
venezuela
s
carabobo
state
has
requested
meetings
to
discuss
the
imprisonment
of
josh
holt
a
mormon
missionary
from
utah
and
his
wife
thamara
caleno
the
couple
have
been
held
since
june
when
they
were
arrested
on
weapons
charges
shortly
after
holt
traveled
to
venezuela
to
marry
caleno
we
are
aware
that
he
is
here
there
are
suspicions
that
the
venezuela
government
is
using
the
illegitimate
detention
of
holt
as
a
bargaining
chip
to
talk
about
sanctions
a
official
said
we
continue
to
call
for
the
immediate
and
unconditional
release
of
holt
and
until
he
is
released
we
continue
to
insist
on
regular
ongoing
consular
contacts
with
him
as
called
for
under
international
law
the
official
said
it
is
unusual
for
an
official
from
venezuela
to
visit
washington
for
such
meetings
washington
and
caracas
are
international
adversaries
with
disagreements
on
a
wide
range
of
issues
president
donald
trump
s
administration
is
considering
new
sanctions
targeting
the
country
s
oil
sector
to
increase
pressure
on
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
as
he
runs
for
another
term
in
an
election
washington
and
its
allies
consider
a
sham
another
source
familiar
with
the
situation
confirmed
that
lacava
was
in
washington
to
discuss
holt
s
situation
but
did
not
believe
that
sanctions
relief
would
be
discussed
in
meetings
with
members
of
congress
since
lawmakers
would
defer
to
the
trump
administration
on
any
such
matter
while
i
am
not
able
to
speculate
on
what
else
might
be
on
lacava
s
agenda
i
want
to
make
very
clear
that
the
sole
purpose
of
such
meetings
would
be
to
encourage
the
release
of
holt
and
his
wife
the
source
said
there
would
be
no
negotiation
and
any
claim
to
the
contrary
is
simply
false
the
source
said
lawmakers
led
by
senator
orrin
hatch
of
utah
have
been
advocating
for
holt
s
immediate
release
a
hatch
spokesman
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
lacava
s
visit
