global
stocks
and
the
dollar
fell
on
wednesday
after
a
strong
advocate
of
free
trade
resigned
from
the
white
house
fanning
fears
that
president
donald
trump
will
proceed
with
protectionist
tariffs
and
risk
a

economic
adviser
gary
cohn
seen
as
a
bulwark
against
protectionist
forces
within
the
trump
administration
said
on

he
was

msci
s
world
equity
index

having
seen
some

that

opening

lower
the
implication
is
that
without
the
restraining
influence
of
cohn
on
trump
the
president
will
now
have
a
free
hand
to
press
ahead
with
further
tariffs
and
generally
up
the
ante
on
trade
said
neil
wilson
an
analyst
at
etx
capital
this
in
itself
does
not
bode
well
for
risk
despite
that
small
boost
we
saw
on
news
that
north
korea
could
consider
cohn
s
departure
rippled
through
foreign
exchange
markets
with
the

falling
percent
and

respectively
against
the
japanese
yen
and

franc
both
seen
as
in
times
of
uncertainty
the

is
just
off
a
low
against
the

hit
on
friday
the
worst
outcome
for
financial
markets
in
terms
of
potential
to
create
volatility
would
be
a
confirmation
of
rising
trade
friction
and
benign
neglect
of
the

in
the
short
term
said
analysts
at
anz
the
canadian
dollar
and
the
mexican
peso
both
retreated
by
around
percent
against
the
dollar
as
cohn
s
departure
was
seen
as
raising
risks
that
washington
could
walk
away
from
nafta
negotiations
other
emerging

currencies
that
typically
move
in
sympathy
with
the
