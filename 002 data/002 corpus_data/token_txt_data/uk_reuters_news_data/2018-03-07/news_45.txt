after
a
prolonged
selloff
that

graphic
ge

helping
to
narrow
the
gap
is
a
percent
slide
in

over
and
a

driven
in

by
a

now
paying
the
price
for
focusing
outside
its
traditional
industrial
manufacturing
turf
while
its
rivals
have
enjoyed
a
more
steady
ascent
thanks
to
a
sharper
focus
on
their
industrial
roots
all
the
diversified
industrials
like
honeywell
united

and
to
name
a
few
have
benefited
from
some
of

really
talking
about

think
is
a
very

really
isn

in

underweight
with
a

target
of

some
analysts
are
optimistic
about

and
future
prospects
william
blair
co
analyst
nicholas
heymann
believes
that
the
worse
could
be
over
for
ge
and
its
shares
are
likely
to
begin
stabilizing
before
moving
higher
as
progresses
i
think
ge
shares
have
been
a
bit
oversold
due
to
excessive
fears
about
liquidity
heymann
wrote
in
a
note
heymann
cites
higher
oil
prices
improving
performance
of
ge
s
aviation
and
healthcare
businesses
and
the
recent
nomination
of
three
exceptionally
talented
directors
to

has
an
outperform
rating
on
the
stock
ge
shares
slid
even
after
the
company
replaced
jeff
immelt
as
ceo
last
august
with
john
flannery
his
turnaround
plan
which
includes
cutting
jobs
slashing
ge
s
dividend
and
a
possible
of
the
conglomerate
is
likely
to
take
a
year
or
more
to
show
results
when
immelt
took
over
in
september
ge
was
the
most
valuable
publicly

during
his

which
ended
