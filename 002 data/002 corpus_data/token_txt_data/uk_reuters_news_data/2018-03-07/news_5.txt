washington
reuters
general
motors
co
chief
executive
mary
barra
called
on
the
congress
on
wednesday
to
expand
a
consumer
tax
credit
for
electric
vehicles
as
the
automaker
said
it
would
boost
production
of
its
ev
chevrolet
bolt
in
response
to
strong
demand
barra
also
called
on
regulators
to
take
into
account
when
scoring
automakers
emissions
the
potential
for
autonomous
ridesharing
vehicles
to
reduce
carbon
dioxide
emissions
and
petroleum
consumption
the
trump
administration
is
reviewing
whether
obama
administration
emissions
standards
that
called
for
roughly
doubling
average
vehicle
fuel
efficiency
by
are
appropriate
we
feel
tax
credits
should
be
expanded
so
our
customers
continue
to
receive
the
benefit
going
forward
barra
told
an
energy
conference
in
houston
we
believe
in
an
gm
has
sold
more
than
and
vehicles
eligible
for
the
credit
the
consumer
tax
credit
phases
out
over
a
soon
after
an
automaker
hits
the
mark
and
the
largest
automaker
is
expected
to
hit
the
mark
later
this
year
the
tax
credit
is
aimed
at
helping
defray
the
cost
of
pricier
electric
vehicles
introduced
in
october
the
bolt
was
the
first
electric
vehicle
to
go
more
than
miles
km
between
charges
and
sell
at
a
sticker
price
of
under
electrically
powered
vehicles
account
for
a
just
a
fraction
of
gm
s
overall
sales
in
an
analyst
estimated
gm
loses
on
every
bolt
it
sells
gm
does
not
disclose
individual
vehicle
profitability
company
spokesman
pat
morrissey
said
by
phone
gm
sold
about
bolt
evs
worldwide
last
year
mostly
in
the
united
states
the
company
declined
to
say
how
much
it
would
hike
production
when
it
adds
production
later
this
year
at
an
assembly
plant
north
of
detroit
tesla
inc
said
last
month
it
expected
to
reach
the
figure
later
this
year
congress
opted
not
to
kill
the
tax
credit
as
part
of
a
tax
overhaul
passed
in
december
but
did
not
act
on
a
proposal
that
would
have
lifted
the
cap
entirely
but
then
sunset
the
credit
in
a
few
years
gm
said
in
october
it
planned
to
launch
new
electric
vehicles
by
but
did
not
provide
more
specifics
automakers
around
the
world
are
investing
tens
of
billions
collectively
to
electrify
vehicles
automakers
want
the
trump
administration
to
revise
the
through
fuel
efficiency
standards
the
administration
must
determine
by
april
whether
the
standards
are
appropriate
and
regulators
are
expected
to
declare
they
are
not
administration
officials
are
considering
proposing
a
significant
reduction
in
the
requirements
according
to
automakers
and
government
officials
we
also
feel
the
regulations
need
to
comprehend
new
developments
in
the
industry
like
the
move
away
from
one
owner
one
vehicle
that
have
taken
place
since
the
rule
was
finalized
in
barra
said
current
standards
did
not
comprehend
increased
shared
and
autonomous
electric
gm
s
commitment
to
an
future
is
unwavering
regardless
of
any
modifications
to
future
