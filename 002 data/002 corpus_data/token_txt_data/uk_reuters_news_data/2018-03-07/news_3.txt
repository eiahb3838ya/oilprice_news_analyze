bridges
and
other
infrastructure
representative

must
be
found
congress
has
transferred
nearly
billion
to
the
highway
trust
fund
since
in
order
to
maintain
current
spending
levels
lawmakers
would
need
to
approve
an
additional
billion
from
through
some
lawmakers
suggested
hiking
the
federal
gasoline
tax
which
at
has
not
been
raised
since
and
rising
vehicle
fuel
efficiency
is
reducing
revenue
to
pay
for
road
repairs
while
some
states
have
hiked
gasoline
taxes
since
many
key
republicans
in
congress
strongly
oppose
a
federal
gasoline
tax
hike
there
s
been
no
political
price
to
pay
shuster
said
for
state
politicians
hiking
gasoline
taxes
he
said
congress
will
pay
a
price
if
they
do
not
have
a
funding
fix
we
are
already
paying
it
in
congestion
bad
roads
and
failing
president
donald
trump
last
month
endorsed
hiking
the
federal
gasoline
tax
by
cents
a
gallon
in
a
meeting
with
lawmakers
about
funding
his
infrastructure
spending
proposal
a
democratic
lawmaker
said
he
has
not
endorsed
it
publicly
and
the
white
house
would
not
confirm
or
deny
the
report
if
you
don
t
increase
taxes
we
re
not
having
an
infrastructure
bill
and
we
re
doing
nothing
representative
peter
defazio
the
top

said
at
the
hearing
we
have
to
have
real
the
american
trucking
associations
and
chamber
of
commerce
both
testified
in
favor
of
boosting
gasoline
taxes
on
wednesday
but
representative
sam
graves
a
missouri
republican
said
there
is
little
chance
of
winning
support
in
the
house
to
hike
gasoline
taxes
but
said
a
solution
must
be
found
there
simply
isn
t
any
money
left
under
the
couch
cushions
he
said
trump
wants
to
use
billion
in
federal
funds
to
try
to
stimulate
trillion
in
infrastructure
improvements
over
years
but
would
cut
an
equivalent
amount
in
projected
infrastructure
spending
from
the
federal
budget
as
it
shifted
more
costs
to
states
and
cities
senate
democrats
wednesday
proposed
trillion
in
new
federal
spending
paid
for
by
repealing
some
tax
cuts
approved
in
december
trump
would
make
it
easier
for
states
to
impose
new
tolls
last
month
the
white
house
praised
an
experimental
program
in
oregon
that
charges
a
mileage
tax
to
volunteer
drivers
but
ramping
that
up
nationally
could
take
a
decade
experts
testified
wednesday
congressional
aides
say
it
is
looks
increasingly
unlikely
that
a
major
infrastructure
package
will
be
approved
this
year
citing
the
pending
november
elections
and
a
glut
of
issues
on
the
calendar
