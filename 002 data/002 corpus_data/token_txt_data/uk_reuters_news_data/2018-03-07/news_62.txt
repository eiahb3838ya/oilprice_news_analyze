as
one
of
the

s
most
promising
oil

he
added
wintershall
s
assets
so
far
stretch
from
oil
field
concessions
in
libya
to
subsea
fields
in
the
north

and
to
russia
s
arctic

it

is
ready
to
in
various
arrangements
for
various

in
brazil
as
is
customary
in
the
oil
and
gas
industry
mehren
said
foreign
companies
such
as
exxon
and
statoil
as
well
as
brazilian
firms
could
be
open
to
partnerships
he
added
for

brazil
would
add
to

boe
wintershall
expects
significant
rises
in
sales
and
earnings
before
special
items
in
after
increasing
both
steeply
in
thanks
to

volumes
and
higher

increased
percent
to

barrel
on
average
for
north
sea
grade
brent
wintershall
s
internal
company
planning
is
based
on
an
average
price
of
this
year
and
an
exchange
rate
of
per

it
also
sees
gas
prices
remaining
at
current
levels
in
europe
in
after
spot
gas
at
european
trading
hubs
rose
percent
last
year
the
merger
with
dea
which
basf
said
last
week
would
likely
close
by
the
end
of
the
third
quarter
will
bring
synergies
in
german
and
norwegian
oil
and
gas
ventures
where
the
two
operate
separately
and
in
administration
costs
mehren
said
this
would
likely
affect
the
two
headquarters
at
kassel
and
hamburg
mehren
said
mentioning
that
frankfurt
germany
s
business
capital
could
become
an
option
for
moving
certain
operations
the
merger
will
be
followed
by
an
initial
public
offering
of
the
merged
entity
which
basf
said
it
did
not
expect
to
happen
