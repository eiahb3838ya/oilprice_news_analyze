new
york
reuters
exxon
mobil
corp
on
wednesday
laid
out
a
goal
to
double
annual
earnings
by
through
heavier
investments
in
a
bid
to
allay
investor
fears
that
the
world
s
largest
publicly
traded
oil
producer
has
seen
its
best
days
but
shares
still
fell
to
their
lowest
level
in
more
than
two
years
after
the
company
said
the
spending
would
not
boost
production
and
investors
who
had
expected
large
share
buybacks
were
disappointed
that
executives
did
not
announce
any
exxon
was
once
the
industry
s
profit
and
leader
but
sagging
output
and
a
sliding
share
price
have
pushed
total
return
or
share
appreciation
plus
dividends
into
negative
territory
over
the
last
five
years
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
by
comparison
total
returns
are
up
percent
for
chevron
corp
and
percent
for
royal
dutch
shell
plc
exxon
s
growth
plan
will
require
billions
of
dollars
in
spending
spread
across
shale
fields
along
with
refinery
expansions
and
deepwater
megaprojects
the
company
said
investments
should
drive
profit
to
billion
in
with
crude
prices
at
or
above
current
levels
it
was
the
first
time
irving
exxon
has
given
an
earnings
forecast
so
far
in
advance
shares
closed
down
percent
at
the
lowest
close
since
january
darren
woods
who
became
chief
executive
in
january
after
predecessor
rex
tillerson
retired
and
became
the
secretary
of
state
also
said
he
was
committed
to
being
more
transparent
with
investors
there
s
a
lot
different
today
not
just
style
woods
said
at
the
company
s
annual
analyst
day
in
new
york
my
objective
is
to
get
this
organisation
focussed
on
driving
value
and
turning
that
value
into
results
that
you
all
will
exxon
said
projects
in
guyana
and
the
permian
basin
region
of
texas
and
new
mexico
as
well
as
refining
and
chemical
plant
expansions
should
drive
earnings
gains
exxon
reported
an
adjusted
profit
of
billion
in
to
achieve
its
goals
exxon
said
it
will
boost
spending
on
capital
projects
to
billion
this
year
billion
next
year
and
an
average
of
billion
from
to
meanwhile
peers
including
chevron
are
cutting
spending
or
promising
to
hold
budgets
flat
capex
is
the
price
you
pay
for
cash
flow
said
woods
who
added
that
every
dollar
in
capital
spending
by
exxon
in
the
past
decade
has
generated
in
operating
cash
flow
woods
said
he
expected
production
to
grow
about
million
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
to
about
million
in
as
projects
come
online
when
an
analyst
asked
if
he
would
resign
if
the
targets
were
not
met
woods
did
not
directly
answer
but
said
he
intended
to
meet
the
goals
tom
ellacott
senior
vice
president
at
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
noted
that
in
the
near
term
exxon
s
production
will
be
flat
and
growth
in
the
next
decade
will
require
hitting
goals
at
five
key
development
regions
in
the
permian
basin
the
largest
oilfield
exxon
plans
to
triple
production
by
at
recently
purchased
acreage
the
expansion
highlights
the
increasing
importance
of
shale
alongside
the
company
s
global
megaprojects
several
analysts
viewed
the
higher
spending
as
problematic
even
as
they
welcomed
the
pledge
of
greater
transparency
by
a
company
that
has
been
criticized
for
giving
few
operations
details
in
recent
years
to
us
this
highlights
that
there
are
no
easy
fixes
to
rejuvenate
exxon
s
portfolio
and
it
is
likely
to
take
time
for
this
investment
to
flow
through
into
higher
earnings
cash
flow
and
returns
said
rbc
capital
markets
analyst
biraj
borkhataria
exxon
s
operating
margin
which
measures
profit
after
expenses
dipped
to
percent
last
year
far
below
the
industry
median
of
percent
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
several
analysts
pushed
woods
for
still
more
transparency
asking
him
directly
to
participate
in
quarterly
earnings
conference
calls
unlike
ceos
of
most
public
companies
including
oil
majors
exxon
ceos
historically
have
not
joined
the
calls
where
analysts
can
ask
for
operations
details
and
outlooks
please
disclose
more
and
meet
us
more
we
would
be
greatly
appreciative
wolfe
research
analyst
paul
sankey
said
to
woods
at
the
meeting
woods
did
not
commit
to
being
on
the
calls
but
said
he
has
been
meeting
more
with
investors
in
the
past
year
chevron
on
tuesday
said
it
should
be
able
to
raise
production
percent
to
percent
this
year
and
buy
back
shares
for
the
first
time
in
at
least
three
years
even
without
a
substantial
rise
in
oil
prices
