cities
are
responsible
for
a
huge
share
of
emissions
when
calculations
include
goods
they
consume
from
developing
countries
researchers
said
on
tuesday
challenging
traditional
estimates
that
put
blame
on
manufacturing
nations
looking
at
emissions
based
on
consumption
affluent
cities
mostly
in
north
america
and
europe
emit
percent
more
greenhouse
gases
than
they
do
using
traditional
calculations
researchers
said
at
a
united
climate
summit
calculating
emissions
of
greenhouse
gases
which
are
blamed
for
global
warming
traditionally
looks
at
where
goods
such
as
cellular
phones
or
plastic
cups
are
produced
they
said
but
emissions
presents
a
fuller
picture
by
attributing
emissions
to
the
consumers
rather
than
the
manufacturers
said
mark
watts
head
of
an
alliance
of
more
than
global
cities
the
newer
method
of
calculation
puts
the
responsibility
on
richer
consumers
and
increases
the
scope
of
things
that
policy
makers
in
cities
can
address
to
reduce
emissions
watts
said
cities
account
for
an
estimated
percent
of
carbon
emissions
according
to
figures
used
at
the
summit
the
estimate
by
comes
amid
concern
that
national
governments
are
not
on
track
to
meet
the
pledges
they
made
in
in
paris
to
reduce
greenhouse
gases
and
curb
climate
change
traditional
calculations
put
manufacturing
countries
such
as
china
and
india
amid
the
lead
emitters
of
greenhouse
gases
using
calculations
emissions
in
affluent
cities
were
three
times
more
than
they
were
with
traditional
figuring
the
researchers
said
using
emissions
is
revolutionary
although
still
on
the
periphery
said
debra
roberts
a
on
the
s
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
but
these
are
ideas
whose
time
is
probably
almost
imminent
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
on
the
sidelines
of
the
edmonton
summit
the
researchers
used
trade
and
household
data
from
cities
that
are
members
of
some
climate
scientists
and
city
planners
from
countries
are
gathered
in
the
western
canadian
city
to
help
chart
a
global
roadmap
for
cities
to
battle
climate
change
