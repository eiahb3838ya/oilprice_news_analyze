hungarian
prime
minister
viktor
orban
announced
handouts
to
millions
of
families
and
pensioners
on
wednesday
after
his
fidesz
party
suffered
a
surprise
defeat
ahead
of
an
april
national
poll
fidesz
is
well
ahead
of
rivals
in
opinion
polls
for
the
national
election
but
was
caught
off
guard
by
the
victory
of
an
independent
over
its
candidate
in
a
on
seeking
a
third
consecutive
term
fidesz
is
campaigning
with
a
fiercely
message
and
promises
of
more
state
spending
including
on
wages
and
pensions
in
a
video
clip
posted
on
his
facebook
page
orban
said
the
country
s
around
million
pensioners
would
receive
a
voucher
for
food
purchases
and
that
every
hungarian
family
would
get
a
refund
of
forints
on
its
heating
bill
in
the
past
weeks
we
have
suffered
from
extreme
cold
weather
in
hungary
the
gas
consumption
of
families
has
increased
and
so
did
the
gas
bill
therefore
we
decided
on
a
winter
reduction
of
gas
bills
orban
said
it
was
not
immediately
clear
whether
the
refund
would
be
financed
from
the
state
budget
or
by
gas
firms
most
gas
distribution
companies
are
owned
by
the
state
after
orban
s
government
took
over
much
of
the
energy
sector
from
foreign
firms
over
the
past
eight
years
hungary
s
national
weather
institute
has
said
this
winter
has
been
milder
than
usual
and
that
january
was
the
sixth
warmest
since
the
economy
ministry
was
not
immediately
available
to
comment
on
the
cost
of
the
new
measures
reuters
calculations
showed
the
two
measures
could
cost
a
total
of
over
billion
forints
million
pounds
but
peter
virovacz
an
analyst
at
ing
bank
said
this
posed
no
risk
to
the
budget
deficit
target
this
can
be
covered
from
the
reserves
he
said
we
can
regard
this
as
a
gesture
ahead
of
hungarian
governments
of
various
hues
have
often
offered
generous
welfare
handouts
to
voters
ahead
of
elections
since
the
fall
of
communism
in
orban
said
last
week
that
opposition
parties
would
unite
to
try
to
oust
his
party
in
the
national
election
and
would
turn
hungary
into
a
haven
for
immigrants
