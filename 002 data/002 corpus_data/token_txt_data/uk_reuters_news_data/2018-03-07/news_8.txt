mall
island
nations
are
looking
to
cities
for
ideas
to
fight
climate
change
as
they
are
dealing
with
problems
on
a
similar
scale
said
a
top
minister
for
the
caribbean
nation
of
lucia
on
wednesday
islands
in
the
caribbean
sea
with
populations
comparable
to
cities
are
increasingly
seeking
guidance
from
urban
leaders
rather
than
those
at
global
gatherings
of
nations
said
gale
rigobert
lucia
s
minister
of
sustainable
development
in
an
interview
small
islands
especially
those
of
coral
are
on
the
frontlines
of
rising
sea
levels
that
cause
stronger
and
more
frequent
more
storm
surges
wash
damaging
salt
deposits
onto
cropland
and
are
submerging
some
land
altogether
as
small
island
states
it
is
easy
for
us
to
be
lost
in
the
wider
discourse
rigobert
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
on
the
sidelines
of
a
united
climate
summit
some
scientists
and
city
planners
from
countries
are
gathered
in
the
western
canadian
city
of
edmonton
to
help
chart
a
global
roadmap
for
cities
to
battle
climate
change
small
island
nations
such
as
antigua
barbados
dominica
and
lucia
are
tending
to
send
delegations
to
such
climate
meetings
for
cities
finding
them
more
useful
for
concrete
ideas
than
meetings
rigobert
said
as
momentum
grows
behind
initiatives
by
cities
battling
climate
change
separately
from
national
governments
rigobert
said
lucia
is
finding
solutions
tailored
to
its
size
the
beauty
of
having
a
city
or
regional
approach
is
that
in
terms
of
scale
it
allows
us
for
a
more
immediate
comparison
she
said
last
year
agriculture
in
lucia
a
volcanic
island
in
the
eastern
caribbean
was
badly
hit
by
hurricane
matthew
hurricane
tomas
in
also
caused
serious
damage
lucia
s
population
of
people
compares
to
that
of
fort
lauderdale
in
the
state
of
florida
a
city
hard
hit
by
hurricane
irma
last
year
the
resemblance
gives
small
islands
access
to
new
strategies
by
cities
rigobert
said
such
as
permeable
pavements
flood
prevention
measures
and
shifts
away
from
fossil
fuels
in
terms
of
practical
pragmatic
solutions
we
re
finding
that
a
engagement
is
proving
to
be
very
tangible
with
more
immediate
results
she
said
if
you
in
a
country
or
space
maybe
your
voice
might
be
lost
but
if
you
look
at
a
local
comparison
or
city
comparisons
then
it
allows
for
a
great
exchange
of
opportunities
and
ideas
