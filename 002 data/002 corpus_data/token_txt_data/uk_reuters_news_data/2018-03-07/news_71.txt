rising
energy

drawn
increasing

the

has
introduced

ofgem
plans
to
cut
the
cost
of

range
or
the
amount
network
firms
pay
their
shareholders
to
to
percent
for
the
next
regulatory
period
starting
down
from

now
in
total
we
estimate
this

about

per

on
the
dual
fuel
household

through
their

ofgem
said
under
ofgem
s
framework
energy
network
operators
set
out
their
plans
for
investment
and
how
much
they
expect
this
to
cost
over
the
period
ofgem
sets
the
return
the
companies
can
make
network
firms
said
ofgem
s
new
plans
could
hurt
investment
ofgem
will
need
to
think
very
carefully
about
whether
their
proposals
encourage
the
necessary
investment
in
critical
infrastructure
that
ensures
resilience

said
in
a
statement
fixed
returns
have
prompted
investors
to
scoop
up
network
assets
in
recent
years
including
abu

investment
authority
which
in
bought
a
percent
stake
of

until

period
runs
from
to
ofgem
senior
partner
for
networks
jonathan
brearley
told
reporters
the
changes
would
affect
company
profits
but
exactly
how
that
plays
into
their
margins
is
too
early
to
brearley
said
the
proposals
offered
attractive
and
stable
returns
but
ensured
the
lowest
possible
prices
for
consumers
ofgem
has
been
criticised
by
consumer
groups
for
allowing
the
industry
generous
returns
while
energy
suppliers
blame
rising
network
costs
for
price
rises
ofgem
data
shows
network
costs
make
up
about
percent
of
an
average
energy
bill
we
will
be
working
through
the
proposals
announced
today
including
ofgem
s
opening
view
on
what
the
cost
of
equity
should
be

association
ofgem
also
proposed
cutting
the
regulatory
period
to
five
years
from
eight
years

proposed
setting
