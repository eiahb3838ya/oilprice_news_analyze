islamabad
reuters
as
influence
in
islamabad
wanes
pakistan
s
former
adversary
russia
is
building
military
diplomatic
and
economic
ties
that
could
upend
historic
alliances
in
the
region
and
open
up
a
gas
market
for
moscow
s
energy
companies
russia
s
embrace
of
pakistan
comes
at
a
time
when
relations
between
the
united
states
and
its
historical
ally
are
unravelling
over
the
war
in
afghanistan
a
remarkable
turnaround
from
the
when
pakistan
helped
funnel
weapons
and
spies
across
the
border
to
aid
afghan
fighters
battling
soviet
troops
though
the
rapprochement
is
in
its
infancy
and
it
is
neighbour
china
that
is
filling
the
growing
void
left
by
the
united
states
in
pakistan
a
slew
of
energy
deals
and
growing
military
cooperation
promise
to
spark
life
into
the
relationship
that
was
dead
for
many
decades
it
is
an
opening
khurram
dastgir
khan
pakistan
s
defence
minister
told
reuters
both
countries
have
to
work
through
the
past
to
open
the
door
to
the
the
cosier
diplomatic
ties
have
so
far
focussed
on
afghanistan
where
russia
has
cultivated
ties
to
the
afghan
taliban
militants
who
are
fighting
troops
and
have
historic
links
to
islamabad
moscow
says
it
is
encouraging
peace
negotiations
both
russia
and
pakistan
are
also
alarmed
by
the
presence
of
islamic
state
is
inside
afghanistan
with
moscow
concerned
the
group
s
fighters
could
spread
towards
central
asia
and
closer
to
home
in
pakistan
is
has
already
carried
out
major
attacks
we
have
common
ground
on
most
issues
at
diplomatic
levels
pakistan
s
prime
minister
shahid
khaqan
abbasi
told
reuters
it
s
a
relationship
that
will
grow
substantially
in
the
the
russian
foreign
ministry
in
an
emailed
statement
to
reuters
said
moscow
and
islamabad
had
been
developing
cooperation
for
years
but
that
the
relationship
was
entering
a
new
qualitative
phase
one
of
the
key
areas
of
cooperation
is
the
fight
against
terrorism
russia
will
continue
its
practical
assistance
in
bolstering
pakistan
s
capabilities
including
by
supplying
military
equipment
the
ministry
said
during
a
trip
to
moscow
last
month
by
pakistan
s
foreign
minister
khawaja
asif
the
two
countries
announced
plans
to
establish
a
commission
on
military
cooperation
to
combat
the
threat
of
is
in
the
region
they
also
agreed
to
continue
annual
military
training
exercises
that
began
in
and
followed
the
sale
of
four
russian
attack
helicopters
to
pakistan
as
well
as
the
purchase
of
russian
engines
for
the
pakistan
air
force
s
fighter
jets
that
pakistan
s
military
assembles
on
its
own
soil
the
detente
has
been
watched
with
suspicion
by
pakistan
s
neighbour
and
india
which
broadly
stood
in
the
soviet
camp
during
the
cold
war
era
in
the
last
two
decades
the
close
relationship
has
been
underpinned
by
huge
arms
sales
by
moscow
to
a
country
it
calls
a
strategic
partner
if
the
russians
start
backing
the
pakistanis
in
a
big
way
at
the
political
level
then
it
creates
a
problem
for
us
said
sushant
sareen
a
leading
expert
on
india
s
relations
to
pakistan
and
afghanistan
with
new
observer
research
foundation
india
s
foreign
ministry
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
russia
s
ties
with
pakistan
but
has
previously
said
that
its
own
relations
with
moscow
have
stood
the
test
of
time
and
that
the
two
nations
are
building
up
defence
and
energy
relations
including
collaboration
on
nuclear
reactors
in
india
russian
overtures
to
pakistan
offer
a
badly
needed
diplomatic
lifeline
for
the
south
asian
nation
as
it
faces
growing
friction
with
western
powers
over
its
alleged
links
to
militants
at
urging
and
with
backing
from
britain
france
and
germany
a
global
financial
watchdog
the
financial
action
task
force
fatf
last
month
decided
to
place
pakistan
back
on
its
watchlist
of
countries
with
inadequate
controls
potentially
hurting
pakistan
s
fragile
economy
the
move
which
islamabad
angrily
dismissed
as
an
effort
to
embarrass
pakistan
followed
washington
s
announcement
in
january
to
suspend
billion
in
military
assistance
asif
pakistan
s
foreign
minister
said
his
nation
made
a
historical
error
by
tilting
percent
to
the
west
and
was
now
eager
build
alliances
closer
to
home
with
the
likes
of
china
russia
and
turkey
we
want
to
correct
the
imbalance
of
our
foreign
policy
over
years
asif
told
reuters
we
are
not
divorcing
that
relationship
with
the
west
but
we
want
to
have
a
balance
in
our
relationships
we
want
to
be
closer
to
our
friends
in
our
defence
minister
khan
said
pakistan
s
military
which
has
historically
been
heavily
reliant
on
weapons
and
aircraft
may
have
no
choice
but
to
ramp
up
purchases
from
the
likes
of
russia
the
cooling
relationship
with
washington
is
already
pushing
islamabad
closer
to
china
which
is
investing
about
billion
in
infrastructure
in
pakistan
but
analysts
say
pakistan
is
wary
of
becoming
overly
dependent
diplomatically
on
beijing
pakistan
is
among
several
nations
that
have
been
courted
by
moscow
after
falling
out
with
washington
including
the
philippines
and
qatar
but
russia
s
aims
for
the
pakistan
relationship
are
unclear
according
to
petr
topychkanov
a
senior
researcher
at
the
stockholm
international
peace
research
institute
it
s
not
very
transparent
even
in
russia
he
said
there
is
no
serious
public
debate
there
is
no
detailed
explanation
to
the
russian
public
about
what
russia
wants
in
russia
s
foreign
ministry
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
about
moscow
s
increasingly
close
relations
with
pakistan
russia
and
pakistan
are
negotiating
potential
energy
deals
worth
in
excess
of
billion
according
to
pakistani
energy
officials
asif
said
four
to
five
huge
power
projects
will
cement
our
relationship
further
russia
last
month
appointed
an
honorary
council
in
the
pakistan
s
northern
khyber
pukhtunkhwa
province
where
its
companies
are
in
talks
to
build
an
oil
refinery
and
a
power
station
but
the
biggest
deals
focus
on
gas
supply
and
infrastructure
to
pakistan
one
of
the
world
s
fastest
growing
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
import
markets
on
a
strategic
basis
russia
is
coming
in
very
fast
on
the
energy
side
said
a
senior
pakistani
energy
official
in
october
pakistan
and
russia
signed
an
agreement
iga
on
energy
paving
the
way
for
russian
gazprom
to
enter
negotiations
to
supply
lng
to
pakistan
the
talks
are
expected
to
conclude
within
three
months
and
gazprom
is
considered
one
of
the
to
clinch
a
supply
deal
according
to
the
pakistani
official
based
on
two
monthly
lng
cargo
deliveries
that
deal
would
be
worth
about
billion
over
years
he
added
there
is
also
growing
confidence
that
a
gas
pipeline
due
to
be
built
by
russia
stretching
km
miles
from
lahore
to
the
port
city
of
karachi
will
go
ahead
sanctions
against
russian
state
conglomerate
rostec
as
well
as
a
dispute
over
pipeline
transport
fees
have
held
up
the
billion
project
since
it
was
signed
in
the
pipeline
would
be
the
biggest
infrastructure
deal
by
russia
since
early
when
soviet
engineers
constructed
the
pakistan
steel
mills
industrial
complex
a
russian
company
according
to
defence
minister
khan
is
eying
up
a
