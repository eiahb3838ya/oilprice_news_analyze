the
energy
secretary
blasted
renewable
fuels
champions
on
wednesday
while
the
head
of
royal
dutch
shell
urged
the
energy
sector
to
focus
on
world
efforts
to
cut
carbon
emissions
revealing
a
yawning
gap
on
climate
issues
speaking
at
the
ceraweek
conference
by
ihs
markit
in
houston
shell
ceo
ben
van
beurden
outlined
an
ambitious
plan
to
reduce
the
company
s
carbon
footprint
and
expand
in
renewables
and
called
on
others
to
follow
the
energy
landscape
is
changing
fast
so
we
must
change
where
change
is
what
the
world
needs
van
beurden
said
he
spoke
after
energy
secretary
rick
perry
struck
a
starkly
different
tone
blasting
the
paris
climate
agreement
to
limit
global
warming
perry
said
it
was
immoral
to
say
people
should
live
without
fossil
fuels
we
are
passionate
about
renewable
energy
but
the
world
especially
developing
economies
will
continue
to
need
fossil
fuels
as
over
a
billion
people
on
the
planet
live
without
access
to
electricity
perry
said
the
united
states
which
under
former
president
barack
obama
helped
negotiate
the
paris
agreement
is
now
the
only
country
that
has
backed
out
of
the
pact
which
calls
for
a
gradual
shift
to
renewable
energy
by
the
end
of
the
century
president
donald
trump
decided
to
withdraw
last
year
van
beurden
in
an
unusually
speech
said
climate
was
the
biggest
challenge
facing
the
energy
sector
there
may
not
be
total
unity
behind
the
paris
agreement
any
longer
but
there
is
no
other
issue
with
the
potential
to
disrupt
our
industry
on
such
a
deep
and
fundamental
perry
extolled
growing
energy
independence
as
a
boom
in
onshore
shale
drilling
led
to
a
rapid
growth
in
oil
as
well
as
natural
gas
the
least
polluting
fossil
fuel
the
rise
of
gas
at
the
expense
of
dirtier
coal
helped
the
world
s
biggest
economy
sharply
reduce
its
carbon
emissions
over
the
last
decade
as
gas
displaced
much
domestic
coal
demand
the
lesson
is
clear
that
we
don
t
have
to
choose
between
growing
our
economy
and
caring
for
our
environment
by
embracing
innovation
over
regulation
we
can
benefit
from
both
perry
said
shell
and
other
european
peers
including
bp
france
s
total
and
norway
s
statoil
are
becoming
increasingly
active
in
the
energy
sector
and
are
vocal
supporters
of
the
paris
agreement
until
recently
climate
has
been
less
prominent
in
strategy
presentations
from
rivals
exxon
mobil
and
chevron
executives
at
the
houston
conference
repeatedly
noted
the
ongoing
increase
in
demand
for
fossil
fuels
and
downplayed
the
overall
viability
of
renewable
energy
other
executives
spoke
of
moving
to
carbon
capture
technologies
and
carbon
taxes
robert
dudley
president
of
bp
said
tuesday
that
at
some
point
in
the
future
a
price
on
carbon
has
to
be
part
of
this
the
projected
growth
of
oil
demand
is
definitely
not
in
line
with
the
paris
climate
goals
said
international
energy
agency
executive
director
fatih
birol
saying
the
industry
must
start
using
carbon
capture
technologies
few
were
as
emphatic
as
van
beurden
who
outlined
how
shell
is
moving
to
meet
its
targets
to
halve
carbon
emissions
by
steps
include
limiting
emissions
from
operations
and
boosting
natural
gas
production
to
reach
percent
of
company
oil
and
gas
output
over
time
this
net
carbon
footprint
ambition
will
transform
our
company
s
product
mix
van
beurden
said
shell
the
world
s
top
trader
of
liquefied
natural
gas
currently
produces
around
million
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
of
which
roughly
half
is
natural
gas
in
new
york
on
wednesday
exxon
mobil
chief
executive
officer
darren
woods
echoed
perry
s
words
at
the
company
s
investor
day
noting
developing
nations
need
solultions
to
generate
more
electricity
as
their
standard
of
living
increases
along
with
the
need
for
carbon
reduction
