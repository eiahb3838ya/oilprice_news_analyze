french
environment
minister
nicolas
hulot
resigned
on
tuesday
in
frustration
over
sluggish
progress
on
climate
goals
and
nuclear
energy
policy
dealing
a
major
blow
to
president
emmanuel
macron
s
already
tarnished
green
credentials
hulot
a
former
tv
presenter
and
green
activist
who
consistently
scored
high
in
opinion
polls
quit
during
a
live
radio
interview
following
what
he
called
an
accumulation
of
disappointments
i
don
t
want
to
lie
to
myself
any
more
or
create
the
illusion
that
we
re
facing
up
to
these
challenges
hulot
said
on
france
inter
i
have
therefore
decided
to
leave
the
hulot
was
among
macron
s
first
ministerial
appointments
following
his
may
election
victory
his
inclusion
helped
to
sustain
a
green
image
france
had
earned
months
earlier
by
brokering
the
paris
agreement
to
combat
global
greenhouse
emissions
but
the
centrist
president
has
watered
down
a
series
of
campaign
pledges
on
the
environment
including
a
commitment
to
cut
the
share
of
nuclear
power
in
french
electricity
to
percent
by
and
boost
renewable
energy
those
policy
shifts
have
been
a
repeated
source
of
frustration
for
hulot
since
a
honeymoon
period
they
have
been
accompanied
by
a
sharp
slide
in
macron
s
ratings
which
touched
new
lows
after
his
bodyguard
was
filmed
assaulting
demonstrators
last
month
hulot
said
he
had
not
informed
macron
before
announcing
his
resignation
this
may
not
be
the
right
protocol
but
if
i
had
warned
them
they
might
have
talked
me
out
of
it
yet
again
hulot
said
his
cabinet
portfolio
also
included
energy
government
spokesman
benjamin
griveaux
said
the
cabinet
regretted
his
resignation
but
also
described
it
as
a
blow
from
which
we
ll
recover
i
don
t
understand
why
he
is
stepping
down
when
we
had
many
successes
in
the
first
year
that
are
to
his
credit
griveaux
told
bfm
television
he
didn
t
win
all
his
battles
but
that
s
the
way
it
goes
for
greenpeace
france
director
julliard
said
that
while
macron
had
made
some
fine
speeches
and
stood
up
to
president
donald
trump
on
climate
change
he
had
never
turned
these
words
to
concrete
action
at
home
there
is
still
no
energy
transition
policy
in
france
julliard
said
shares
in
power
utility
edf
which
is
on
the
hook
for
the
cost
of
decommissioning
older
nuclear
plants
surged
percent
in
early
trading
before
settling
back
to
euros
at
gmt
still
up
percent
on
monday
s
close
hulot
had
also
voiced
disappointment
after
macron
wavered
on
a
commitment
to
ban
the
weedkiller
glyphosate
sold
under
monsanto
s
roundup
trademark
and
failed
to
prevent
total
s
la
mede
refinery
producing
biofuel
from
imported
palm
oil
linked
to
deforestation
his
announcement
came
a
day
after
the
government
promised
to
relax
hunting
laws
in
a
move
widely
seen
as
an
attempt
to
bolster
macron
s
appeal
in
rural
areas
prime
minister
edouard
philippe
said
he
would
discuss
the
composition
of
the
government
with
macron
following
hulot
s
departure
leaving
open
the
possibility
of
other
changes
macron
s
office
sought
to
attribute
the
resignation
to
the
frustration
even
exhaustion
of
a
ministerial
novice
suddenly
confronted
with
the
machinery
of
government
political
and
administrative
timeframes
aren
t
necessarily
as
one
hopes
coming
from
activism
an
elysee
official
said
insisting
that
hulot
s
deep
commitment
to
environmentalism
was
evidenced
by
the
government
s
policy
track
record
in
his
radio
interview
however
hulot
emphasized
the
inadequacy
of
on
climate
change
by
france
and
other
nations
voicing
hope
that
his
exit
might
provoke
deep
introspection
in
our
society
about
the
reality
of
the
world
his
doubts
about
remaining
in
government
had
grown
over
the
summer
as
devastating
droughts
were
met
with
a
tepid
political
response
he
said
alain
juppe
a
conservative
former
prime
minister
and
presidential
contender
said
he
was
impressed
by
hulot
s
and
by
the
nobility
of
his
act
beyond
the
inevitable
political
buzz
i
hope
this
decision
encourages
us
all
to
think
and
to
change
