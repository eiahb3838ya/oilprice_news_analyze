amid
hopes
global
tariff
tensions
were
abating
as
the
united
states
and
mexico
made
a
deal
to
overhaul
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
investors
expect
canada
too
would
agree
to
the
new
terms
to
preserve
a
pact
ultimately
dispelling
the
economic

caused

however
some
analysts
were
treating
this
rally
with
a
degree
of
caution
news
of
the
trade
deal
has
fuelled
risk
appetite
analysts
at
anz
said
in
a
note
to
clients
it
is
hard
to
extrapolate
much
out
of
it
as
the
united
states
continues
to
treat
each
country
and
deal
on
its
own
merit
we
remain
wary
of
the
current
rally
in
risk
appetite
and
see
it
as
investors
will
keep
an
eye
on
economic
data
with
consumer
confidence
figures
due
later
in
the
day
and
the
latest
estimate
for
gross
domestic
product
expected
on
wednesday
the
nafta
agreement
is
clearly
a
positive
to
the
extent
that
it
reduces
the
risk
of
a
generalized
global
trade
war
jpmorgan
analysts
said
in
a
note
though
they
cautioned
it
was
not
automatically
positive
for
the
outcome
of
talks

china

apac
