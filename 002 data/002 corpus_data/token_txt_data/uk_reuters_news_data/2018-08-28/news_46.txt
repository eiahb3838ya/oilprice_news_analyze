free

agreement
boosted

appetite
investors
expect
canada
too
would
agree
to
the

the
upbeat
trade
outlook
was
further
boosted
by
news
that
washington
was
pressuring
the
european
union
to
accelerate
tariff
talks
however
some
analysts
were
cautious
about
the
rally
news
of
the
trade
deal
has
fuelled
risk
appetite
anz
analysts
said
in
a
client
note
it
is
hard
to
extrapolate
much
out
of
it
as
the
united
states
continues
to
treat
each
country
and
deal
on
its
own
merit
we
remain
wary
of
the
current
rally
in
risk
appetite
and
see
it
as
disputes
between
the
united
states
and
its
trading
partners
have
been
a
drag
on
investor
sentiment
for
much
of
the
year
despite
solid
economic
fundamentals
and
two
robust
quarters
of
corporate
earnings
jpmorgan
analysts
said
the
trade
deal
was
not
necessarily
positive
for
the
outcome
of
talks
with
china
the
nafta
agreement
is
clearly
a
positive
to
the
extent
that
it
reduces
the
risk
of
a
generalized
global
trade
war
they
said
despite
this
apac

the
united
states
and
china
held
two
days
of
talks
last
week
without
a
major
breakthrough
as
their
trade
war
escalated
with
the
activation
of
another
round
of
duelling
tariffs
on
