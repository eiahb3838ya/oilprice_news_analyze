the

joining

threatened
he
still
could
put

on

and
demanded
concessions
on
canada
s
dairy
protections
if
canada
does
not
join
then

to
the
deal
will
be
trickier
donovan
said
and
the
toughest
battle
in
the
trade
war
with
china
still
looms
the
united
states
and
china
held
two
days
of
talks
last
week
without
a
major
breakthrough
as
another
round
of
tariffs
came
into
effect
the
commerce
department
also
said
on
monday
that
chinese
steel
wheels
exports
were
heavily
subsidised
and
that
it
could
impose
duties
on
the
product
these
issues
kept
chinese
shares
trading
near
flat
an
escalation
in
the
spat
would
reverberate
across
asia
given
the
region
s
intricate
supply
chains
and
that

its
economies
still
largely
depend
on
exports

economics
told
clients
but
asian

other
emerging

are
being
supported
for
now
by

pullback
from

the

was
down
percent
just
off

against

basket
of
currencies
dollar
losses
accelerated
last
week
after
federal

signalled
only
a
gradual
pace
of

rises
economic
data
with
latest
estimates
for
gross
domestic
product
expected
on
wednesday
could
determine
the
dollar
s
further
moves
but
its
retreat
has
allowed
currencies
such
as
south
africa
s
rand
and
australian
dollar
to
rise
off
troughs
while
the
mexican
peso
was
at
week
highs
after
surging
more

there
are
exceptions
however

fell
another
percent
against

too
rose

said
the
country
s
public
deficit
could
exceed
the
european
union
s
ceiling
of
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
next
year
the
british
pound
also
slipped
to
languish
near
lows
to
the
euro
as
fears
grew
that
the
country
would
crash
out
of
the
eu
without
a
trade
agreement

scenario
many
see
as
heralding
economic
