be
trickier
donovan
said
the
toughest
battle
in
the

war
with
china
still
looms
the
united
states

china
held
two

further
moves

the

allowed

such
as
south
africa
s
rand
and
the
australian
dollar
to
rise
further
from
troughs
the
mexican
peso
however
lost
percent
versus
the
dollar
after
hitting
week
highs
following
the
trade
deal
the
turkish
lira
fell
another
percent
against
the
dollar
adding
