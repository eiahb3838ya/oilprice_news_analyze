oil
majors
have
already
ploughed
billions
into
brazil
now
latin
america
s
top
producer
to
lock
in
stakes
in
its
offshore
oil
play
where
billions
of
barrels
of
oil
are
trapped
beneath
a
thick
layer
of
salt
under
the
ocean
floor
meanwhile
oil
and
gas
production
in
the
campos
basin
where
activity
began
about
forty
years
ago
has
fallen
by
a
third
over
the
last
seven
years
to
million
boepd
raising
the
spectre
of
hefty
outlays
to
close
down

campos
basin
is
still
a

cow
for
petrobras
said
luiz
hayum
who
authored
the
report
although
output
is
declining
brazil
s
oil
company
petroleo
brasileiro
the
world
s
most
indebted
oil
company
invests
very
little
there
which
means
the
basin
is
a
healthy
source
of
free
cash
flow
he
said
this
is
not
sustainable
for
a
long
time
without
receiving
this
additional
investment
platforms
would
cease
production
by
some
billion
are
needed
to
decommission
those
platforms
and
related
infrastructure
in
the
basin
from

forecasts
but
redirecting
that
money
to
boosting
output
instead
could
add
boepd
to
production
by
postpone
percent
of
the
decommissioning
costs
until
after
and
add
billion
in
royalty
payments
to
the
government
the
consultancy
said
under
a
more
optimistic
scenario
where
brazil
boosts
its
recovery
factor
in
the
basin
to
levels
seen
in
the
gulf
of

petrobras
has
been
seeking
