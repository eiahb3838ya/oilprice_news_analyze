china
s
refiners
increased
their
output
in
july
to
close
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
but
at
the
same
time
exports
of
refined
fuels
fell
to
the
lowest
in
four
months
these
facts
may
seem
contradictory
and
while
there
are
several
issues
than
can
help
explain
the
dynamics
perhaps
the
most
compelling
is
that
china
appears
to
be
becoming
more
attuned
to
market
forces
for
refined
products
in
asia
as
is
often
the
case
with
china
s
intake
and
processing
of
crude
oil
and
its
exports
of
refined
products
the
data
is
incomplete
and
in
this
case
the
main
missing
numbers
are
movements
in
inventories
inventory
data
was
last
released
in
april
so
it
s
hard
to
know
how
much
of
the
refinery
throughput
went
into
storage
tanks
as
opposed
to
being
exported
or
consumed
domestically
but
what
is
known
is
that
refinery
runs
totalled
million
bpd
in
july
a
gain
of
percent
from
the
same
month
in
in
the
first
seven
months
of
the
year
china
s
refineries
processed
million
bpd
an
increase
of
percent
over
the
same
period
last
year
however
exports
of
gasoline
fell
to
tonnes
in
july
equivalent
to
about
bpd
down
from
bpd
in
june
and
bpd
in
may
diesel
exports
fell
to
million
tonnes
or
about
bpd
down
from
bpd
in
june
and
bpd
in
may
in
addition
to
the
unknown
flows
into
inventories
gasoline
and
diesel
exports
may
have
been
affected
by
chinese
refiners
getting
close
to
exhausting
quotas
and
cutting
back
on
shipments
it
is
also
possible
that
the
smaller
independent
refineries
exported
less
because
of
reduced
runs
as
they
battle
higher
crude
oil
prices
and
increased
government
scrutiny
on
taxes
chinese
domestic
consumption
may
also
have
risen
especially
in
the
agricultural
sector
given
the
summer
peak
demand
season
all
of
these
factors
can
help
shed
light
on
the
in
china
s
exports
of
refined
fuels
but
perhaps
the
best
explanation
is
the
movement
of
prices
around
the
time
when
july
exports
would
have
been
arranged
the
profit
from
making
a
barrel
of
gasoline
in
singapore
from
brent
crude
the
main
regional
benchmark
dropped
to
its
low
so
far
this
year
of
a
barrel
on
july
it
had
been
steadily
declining
since
hitting
a
peak
of
a
barrel
on
may
meaning
that
at
the
time
chinese
refiners
would
have
been
contemplating
selling
gasoline
for
exports
the
incentive
to
do
so
was
weakening
it
s
a
similar
story
for
diesel
with
the
profit
margin
or
crack
for
producing
a
barrel
of
parts
per
million
diesel
from
dubai
crude
dropping
to
a
low
of
a
barrel
on
june
down
from
on
may
the
moves
in
pricing
suggest
that
chinese
refiners
may
have
become
more
price
sensitive
and
therefore
less
likely
to
export
surplus
refined
fuels
irrespective
of
the
profit
gained
from
doing
so
what
is
also
worth
noting
is
that
the
cracks
for
both
diesel
and
gasoline
later
strengthened
with
diesel
rising
to
a
barrel
on
before
slipping
slightly
to
end
at
on
monday
the
gasoline
crack
jumped
percent
from
its
july
low
to
a
barrel
on
although
it
subsequently
eased
to
on
monday
the
recovery
in
the
profit
margins
for
refined
fuels
may
have
come
too
late
to
provide
a
significant
boost
to
china
s
exports
in
august
but
september
should
reveal
whether
china
s
refiners
are
indeed
becoming
more
or
whether
the
other
factors
still
play
a
bigger
role
the
opinions
expressed
here
are
