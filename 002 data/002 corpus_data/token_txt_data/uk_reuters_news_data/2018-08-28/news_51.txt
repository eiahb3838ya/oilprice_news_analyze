is
the
producer
in
the
organization
of
the

biggest
and
region
which

at
some
million

bpd
zhenhua
helped
iraq
to

chinese

and
make
more
revenues
for
iraq

a
senior

it
is
not

two
of

said
the
port

comment
somo
did

china
is
under
the
pressure
to
cut
oil
purchases
from
iran
opec
s
producer
as
the
united
states
sanctions
on
tehran
and
threatens
to
choke
off
the
islamic
republic
s
oil
exports
to
zero
amid
the
trade
dispute
between
washington
and
beijing
it
is
also
unclear
whether
chinese
importers
will
be
able
to
continue
to
import
crude
the
deal
would
give
china
another
crude
supply
option
as
the
iran
and
oil
flows
are
threatened
zhenhua
s
relationship
with
somo
goes
back
to
former
iraqi
president
saddam
hussein
s
days
when
parent
company
defence
conglomerate
norinco
was
among
the
first
chinese
entities
active
in
iraq
s
oil
and
gas
exploration
last
year
zhenhua
won
a
term
contract
to
supply
diesel
fuel
to
somo
for
the
first
time
and
it
also
recently
entered
a
deal
to
develop
iraq
s
east
baghdad
oilfield
zhenhua
has
been
marketing
iraq
s
main
crude
grade
basra
light
for
somo
since
the
start
of
and
has
also
sold
some
to
taiwan
said
a
separate
trading
source
zhenhua
the
smallest
of
china
s
oil
and
gas
majors
has
over
the
past
three
years
expanded
its
foothold
in
oil
sales
to
independent
chinese
refiners
which
were
only
allowed
to
start
importing
crude
from
and
now
make
up
some
percent
of
china
s
total
crude
imports
zhenhua
s
crude
sales
to
such
independents
sometimes
known
as
teapots
hit
a
record
million
tonnes
last
year
or
bpd
equivalent
to
about
percent
of
overall
teapot
purchases
according
to
industry
estimates
china
s
state
oil
majors
sinopec
cnooc
and
petrochina
are
regular
iraqi
oil
customers
under
