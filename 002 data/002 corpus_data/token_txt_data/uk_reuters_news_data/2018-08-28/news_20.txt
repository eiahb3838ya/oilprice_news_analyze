after summer of discontent, china's teapot refineries ramp up oil imports
beijing

china
s
independent
refiners
have
ramped
up
their
foreign
oil
buying
after
returning
from
prolonged
summer
maintenance
to
gear
up
for
rising
winter
fuel
demand
a
sign
that
the
financial
pain
from
taxes
and
higher
crude
prices
have
ebbed
for
now
the
in
imports
by
private
refiners
often
called
teapots
has
boosted
the
physical
prices
of
middle
eastern
and
russian
oil
to
their
highest
in
months
their
return
to
the
market
also
comes
as
margins
have
improved
after
their
extended
shutdowns
helped
drain
a
glut
of
diesel
and
gasoline
boosting
domestic
fuel
prices
the
independents
imported
million
tonnes
or
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
in
august
up
percent
from
july
and
percent
higher
from
the
same
period
last
year

oil
research

forecasts
data
showed
their
july
purchases
were
the
on
record
for
data
going
back
to
october
as
refiners
shut
or
suspended
operations
due
to
a
toxic
mix
of
sinking
diesel
demand
higher
crude
prices
and
new
tax
rules
the
calculation
does
not
include
purchases
from
large
private

hengli

and

group
the
teapots
account
for
about
of
the
nearly
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
oil
imported
into
china
the
world
s
biggest
oil
importer
our
bookings
of
heavy
crude
increased
in
august
and
september
as
we
came
back
from
a
maintenance
in
july
said
a
manager
with
a
independent
refiner
who
declined
to
be
identified
as
he
is
not
authorised
to
speak
to
the
media
margins
have
been
negative
for
a
while
but
we
finally
booked
profit
in
august
he
said
adding
that
higher
refined
products
prices
encouraged
more
refineries
to
return
from
maintenance
sustained
buying
from
china
s
independents
will
add
to
global
demand
at
the
same
time
there
are
looming
supply
disruptions
expected
from
major
producers
such
as
venezuela
and
iran
the
surge
in
demand
should
boost
benchmark
futures
prices
it
will
also
allay
worries
about
weaker
demand
as
china
s
economic
growth
has
stumbled
crude
demand
in
september
will
further
pick
up
from
august
because
independents
are
going
to
ramp
up
for
winter
production
in
the
fourth
quarter
said
zhou
guoxia
an
analyst
with
oil
consultancy
jlc
adding
that
the
industry
has
been
haunted
by
tight
credit
and
more
scrutiny
on
their
tax
practices
spot
premiums
for
oman
and
russian
espo
blend
the
typical
grades
that
teapots
buy
rose
to
their
highest
in
months
this
week
supported
by
the
demand
recovery
from
private
refiners
several
trade
sources
said
the
utilisation
rate
of
refiners
rose
to
percent
of
their
capacity
in
the
second
week
of
august
up
from
an
average
of
percent
for
july
calculations
from
jlc
showed
the
run
rates
were
lower
compared
with
refiners
that
were
operating
at
percent
margins
improved
moderately
as
domestic
product
prices
rose
due
to
thinning
fuel
supplies
but
executives
warned
that
profits
for
teapots
are
still
razor
thin
and
smaller
operators
are
struggling
with
the
lingering
issues
of
more
stringent
tax
collection
and
higher
crude
prices
potentially
requiring
some
to
close
for
good
teapots
also
lose
out
on
higher
profits
since
they
lack
the
retail
networks
of
companies
such
as
china
petroleum
chemical
corp
known
as
sinopec
and
the
higher
premiums
from
retail
fuel
sales
the
refiners
do
not
have
government
licenses
to
export
fuels
meaning
they
also
miss
out
on
potentially
lucrative
overseas
sales
another
manager
with
a
refinery
which
is
preparing
to
return
to
full
capacity
said
business
has
gotten
easier
since
early
july
when
the
bankruptcy
of
teapot
shandong
haiyou
petrochemical
cast
doubt
on
the
financial
health
of
the
sector
with
demand
for
crude
coming
back
it
is
easier
for
independents
to
get
financing
and
credit
to
buy
crude
oil
he
said
profit
this
year
in
general
shrunk
from
a
year
ago
the
manager
said
some
small
teapots
with
poor
management
skills
and
loan
problems
might
die
but
overall
the
bigger
teapots
are
