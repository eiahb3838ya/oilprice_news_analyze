oil
producer
equinor
aims
to
boost
the
recovery
rate
from
its
norwegian
fields
to
well
above
the
global
average
to
extend
production
from
the
mature
basin
beyond
equinor
announced
plans
on
tuesday
to
drill
up
to
wells
offshore
from
its
native
norway
in
coming
decades
almost
as
many
as
it
has
drilled
since
its
startup
in
to
mitigate
declining
output
from
older
fields
and
extend
the
production
lifetime
of
more
than
installations
the
company
said
it
remained
on
track
for
to
keep
profitable
oil
and
gas
production
in
norway
towards
but
needed
new
measures
to
tackle
a
decline
after
that
including
a
deliberate
push
to
find
more
natural
gas
we
aim
to
achieve
an
average
recovery
rate
of
and
per
cent
respectively
at
our
oil
and
gas
fields
this
is
almost
twice
the
average
global
oil
recovery
rate
of
per
cent

nylund
equinor
s
head
of
development
and
production
in
norway
said
equinor
s
current
recovery
rate
for
oil
stands
at
percent
the
company
did
not
provide
a
recovery
rate
for
gas
nylund
didn
t
say
when
the
company
aimed
to
achieve
the
target
rates
but
the
plan
to
drill
up
to
production
and
exploration
wells
covers
a
period
up
to
the
plan
meant
that
equinor
will
i
drill
about
production
wells
per
year
to
boost
the
output
from
the
existing
field
up
from
the
previous
plan
of
wells
indicated
earlier
this
year
a
spokesman
for
the
company
said
in
addition
equinor
plans
to
drill
between
and
exploration
wells
each
year
off
norway
including
both
its
own
and
wells
to
search
for
new
reserves
i
think
we
can
keep
that
rate
for
at
least
another
five
years
dodson
told
reuters
the
norwegian
company
europe
s
gas
supplier
after
russia
s
gazprom
said
it
would
prioritize
natural
gas
in
its
exploration
plans
offshore
norway
aiming
to
add
more
volumes
around
the
existing
infrastructure
such
as
the
aasta
hansteen
field
in
the
norwegian
sea
and
elsewhere
natural
gas
is
a
commodity
important
to
climate
we
see
more
demand
for
gas
and
we
can
play
a
bigger
role
in
producing
and
delivering
gas
to
the
global
markets
nylund
told
reuters
we
also
need
to
use
the
existing
infrastructure
in
a
timely
manner
it
will
not
last
forever
he
added
while
the
company
believes
its
norwegian
resource
potential
is
as
large
today
as
it
was
a
decade
ago
each
prospect
is
smaller
making
it
necessary
to
drill
more
and
cheaper
wells
exploration
chief
tim
dodson
told
a
news
conference
the
company
is
currently
investing
heavily
to
develop
the
billion
johan
sverdrup
oilfield
which
will
be
completed
in
two
stages
between
and
as
well
as
the
arctic
johan
castberg
and
an
extension
of
the
troll
gas
field
we
need
to
start
now
after
there
are
currently
few
big
projects
remaining
the
choices
that
we
the
authorities
and
the
industry
make
today
will
be
decisive
nylund
said
we
have
developed
a
strategy
for
more
gas
exploration
we
will
also
test
new
ideas
in
some
prospects
every
year
the
likelihood
of
discovery
in
these
wells
will
be
lower
than
in
other
targets
but
we
see
it
as
necessary
to
regularly
test
a
few
of
what
we
call
game
changing
wells
he
added
earlier
on
tuesday
equinor
announced
plans
to
partly
power
two
of
its
north
sea
oilfields
with
floating
wind
turbines
which
in
turn
would
help
the
company
cuts
its
carbon
dioxide
emissions
