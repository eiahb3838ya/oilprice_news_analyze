norway
s
equinor
said
on
tuesday
it
is
considering
whether
to
build
a
pioneering
offshore
wind
farm
with
floating
turbines
to
supply
electricity
to
two
north
sea
oilfields
as
part
of
a
strategy
to
curb
greenhouse
gas
emissions
the
project
at
the
gullfaks
and
snorre
oilfields
would
cost
around
billion
norwegian
crowns
million
and
could
reduce
norway
s
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
by
more
than
tonnes
per
year
equinor
said
this
could
be
the
first
time
an
offshore
wind
farm
is
directly
connected
to
oil
and
gas
platforms
equinor
said
in
a
statement
the
two
fields
currently
are
powered
by
generators
running
on
natural
gas
at
the
platforms
norway
s
greenhouse
gas
emissions
have
remained
high
despite
pledges
for
deep
cuts
under
international
accords
such
as
the
paris
climate
deal
last
year
norway
s
annual
emissions
were
percent
above
levels
at
million
tonnes
to
maintain
profitable
operations
offshore
norway
in
the
long
term
it
is
essential
that
we
do
our
utmost
to
further
reduce
the
carbon
footprint
from
our
activities
executive
vice
president
arne
sigve
nylund
said
formerly
known
as
statoil
equinor
earlier
this
year
changed
its
name
to
underscore
a
push
into
renewable
energy
under
chief
executive
eldar
saetre
although
oil
and
gas
will
remain
the
company
s
dominant
business
the
company
s
first
floating
offshore
wind
farm
began
operating
off
scotland
last
year
supplying
electricity
to
the
onshore
market
equinor
has
also
announced
plans
for
offshore
wind
projects
in
the
united
states
poland
and
britain
a
final
investment
decision
on
the
plan
for
snorre
and
gullfaks
known
as
the
hywind
tampen
floating
wind
farm
will
be
made
in
equinor
said
the
company
will
seek
to
reduce
the
cost
from
the
preliminary
estimate
equinor
said
it
hoped
norwegian
government
subsidies
would
cover
half
the
capital
expenditure
for
the
project
where
turbines
each
with
a
capacity
of
eight
megawatts
would
meet
about
percent
of
the
power
demand
from
the
two
fields
electricity
generation
costs
could
be
percent
less
than
the
euros
a
megawatt
hour
at
the
scottish
project
this
will
help
reduce
norway
s
overall
carbon
emissions
marius
holm
head
of
environmental
foundation
zero
told
reuters
the
move
will
also
help
industrialise
offshore
wind
and
bring
costs
