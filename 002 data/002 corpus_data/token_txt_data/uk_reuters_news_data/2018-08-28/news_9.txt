norway
s
transmission
system
operator
statnett
may
have
to
pay
large
electricity
users
to
cut
their
energy
consumption
this
winter
if
rainfall
remains
abnormally
low
it
said
on
tuesday
virtually
all
power
generated
in
norway
comes
from
hydroelectrics
after
a
hot
dry
summer
reserves
in
its
hydropower
reservoirs
are
terawatt
hours
below
average
or
about
percent
of
the
country
s
annual
consumption
for
stable
electricity
supply
is
crucial
for
many
of
norway
s
companies
such
as
fertiliser
maker
yara
aluminium
producer
norsk
hydro
and
data
centres
which
could
ultimately
be
affected
the
various
tools
statnett
can
use
include
among
other
things
energy
options
for
consumption
which
means
that
larger
power
consumers
enter
into
agreements
to
reduce
consumption
against
payment
when
needed
statnett
said
this
arrangement
could
only
be
used
in
a
highly
strained
power
situation
and
requires
government
approval
it
added
norsk
hydro
the
country
s
largest
power
user
can
reduce
consumption
for
up
to
an
hour
without
affecting
output
but
longer
constraints
could
result
in
reduced
aluminium
production
hydro
spokesman
oeyvind
breivik
said
reducing
power
for
over
an
hour
can
mean
production
instability
we
wouldn
t
like
to
take
out
large
chunks
of
the
power
supply
unless
it
is
necessary
said
breivik
though
he
said
metals
delivery
to
customers
would
be
unaffected
a
spokeswoman
for
yara
said
that
while
cutting
power
consumption
would
affect
its
norwegian
production
the
firm
would
be
able
to
maintain
volumes
for
customers
through
its
plants
outside
the
country
microsoft
which
plans
to
build
two
data
centres
in
norway
as
part
of
an
agreement
to
supply
cloud
services
to
equinor
was
not
available
for
comment
we
realize
that
many
are
worried
about
the
high
power
prices
statnett
said
if
there
is
little
rainfall
in
the
period
ahead
prices
may
also
be
high
throughout
the
autumn
and
imports
from
denmark
and
germany
could
also
help
mitigate
the
situation
