too
will
agree

hussein
sayed
chief

strategist
at

the
deal
seemed
to
boost
confidence
that
the
trade
war
is
moving
closer
to
an
end

the
next
question

on

german
carmakers
rely
on
smooth
trade
between
mexico
and
the
united

to

however
some
analysts
were
cautious
about
the
rally
paul
donovan
chief
economist
at
ubs
global
wealth
management
noted
markets
were
assuming
already
that
canada
would
join
the
new
deal
but
said
it
is
not
a
zero
risk
process
if
canada
does
not
join
then
getting
the
agreement
of
congress
will
be
trickier
as
authorization
probably
will
not
hold
he
said
disputes
between
the
united
states
and
its
trading
partners
have
been
a
drag
on
investor
sentiment
for
much
of
the
year
despite
solid
economic
fundamentals
and
two
robust
quarters
of
corporate
earnings
and
the
toughest
battle
in
the
trade
war
with
china
still
looms
the
united
states
and
china
held
two
days
of
talks
last

without
a
major
breakthrough
as
another
round
of
tariffs
came
into
effect
the
commerce
department
also
said
on
monday
that
chinese
steel
wheels
exports
were
heavily
subsidised
and
that
it
could
impose
duties
on
the
product
chinese
stocks
were
steady
to
weaker
though
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
index
gained

jpmorgan
analysts
said
the
trade
deal
was
not
necessarily
positive
for
the
outcome
of
talks
with
china
though
they
said
risks
of
a
generalised
global
trade
war
had
abated
somewhat
despite
this

the
turkish

fell
