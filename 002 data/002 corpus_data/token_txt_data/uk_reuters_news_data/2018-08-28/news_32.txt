current
sanctions
on
iran
are
unlikely
to
stop
iranian
oil
exports
completely
a
adviser
at
saudi
arabia
s
energy
ministry
said
on
tuesday
adding
iran
would
be
unable
to
close
the
straits
of
hormuz
and
bab
even
partially
speaking
at
an
oil
conference
in
the
norwegian
city
of
stavanger
ibrahim
said
iran
would
be
the
first
to
lose
out
on
a
move
to
block
those
major
shipping
routes
and
that
any
such
action
would
trigger
further
sanctions
on
iran
current
sanctions
are
unlikely
to
stop
iranian
oil
exports
completely
as
almost
all
experts
agree
i
mean
they
will
continue
to
export
million
barrels
per
day
or
so
so
closing
that
strait
of
hormuz
will
damage
the
iranians
as
much
as
damaging
others
he
said
iran
has
said
if
it
can
not
sell
its
oil
due
to
pressure
then
no
other
regional
country
will
be
allowed
to
do
so
either
threatening
to
block
the
strait
of
hormuz
the
amount
of
oil
going
through
the
strait
of
hormuz
is
so
large
there
s
more
than
million
barrels
a
day
about
two
thirds
of
world
maritime
oil
trade
meaning
cutting
oil
from
there
will
lead
to
an
acute
oil
shortage
and
prices
will
skyrocket
muhanna
said
is
iran
able
or
willing
to
close
completely
or
even
partially
the
strait
of
hormuz
or
bab
or
both
the
answer
is
no
and
a
really
big
president
donald
trump
pulled
out
of
a
pact
between
iran
and
major
world
powers
under
which
sanctions
were
lifted
in
return
for
tehran
accepting
curbs
on
its
nuclear
programme
the
trump
administration
then
announced
unilateral
plans
to
restore
sanctions
against
tehran
