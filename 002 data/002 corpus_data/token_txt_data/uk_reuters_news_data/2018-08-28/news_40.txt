when
farmer
julimar
pansera
purchased
land
in
brazil
s
interior
seven
years
ago
it
was
blanketed
in
tiers
of
fruit
trees
twisted
shrubs
and
the
occasional
palm
standing
tall
in
a
thicket
of
undergrowth
he
mowed
down
most
of
that
vegetation
set
it
ablaze
and
started
planting
soybeans
over
the
past
decade
he
and
others
in
the
region
have
deforested
an
area
larger
than
south
korea
permissive
policies
and
cheap
farm
acreage
here
have
helped
catapult
brazil
into
an
agricultural
superpower
the
world
s
largest
exporter
of
soy
beef
and
chicken
and
a
major
producer
of
pork
and
corn
this
area
has
also
lured
farmers
and
ranchers
away
from
the
amazon
jungle
whose
decline
has
spurred
a
global
outcry
to
protect
it
the
tradeoff
environmentalists
say
is
that
while
brazil
has
slowed
destruction
of
the
renowned
rainforest
from
its
worst
levels
it
has
put
another
vital
ecological
zone
at
risk
a
vast
tropical
savanna
that
is
home
to
percent
of
species
on
the
planet
known
as
the
cerrado
this
habitat
lost
more
than
square
kilometers
square
miles
of
native
cover
since
according
to
government
figures
that
s
percent
more
than
the
deforestation
seen
during
the
same
period
in
the
amazon
a
biome
more
than
three
times
larger
accounting
for
relative
size
the
cerrado
is
disappearing
nearly
four
times
faster
than
the
rainforest
the
largest
savanna
in
south
america
the
cerrado
is
a
vital
storehouse
for
carbon
dioxide
the
greenhouse
gas
whose
rising
emissions
from
fossil
fuels
and
deforestation
are
warming
the
world
s
atmosphere
brazilian
officials
have
cited
protection
of
native
vegetation
as
critical
to
meeting
its
obligations
under
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
but
scientists
warn
the
biome
has
reached
a
tipping
point
that
could
hamper
brazil
s
efforts
and
worsen
global
warming
by
focusing
on
one
problem
brazil
essentially
created
another
said
ane
alencar
science
director
of
the
amazon
environmental
research
institute
known
as
ipam
there
s
a
high
risk
for
the
climate
associated
with
this
expansion
alencar
said
limiting
and
calling
attention
to
deforestation
in
the
amazon
in
a
way
it
forced
the
agribusiness
industry
to
expand
in
the
the
toll
can
already
be
seen
in
the
region
s
water
resources
streams
and
springs
are
filling
with
silt
and
drying
up
as
vegetation
around
them
vanishes
that
in
turn
is
weakening
the
headwaters
of
vital
rivers
flowing
to
the
rest
of
the
country
scientists
say
the
imperiled
waterways
include
the
sao
francisco
brazil
s
longest
river
outside
the
amazon
where
water
levels
are
hitting
lows
in
the
dry
season
the
removal
of
vegetation
can
lead
a
body
of
water
to
extinction
said
liliana
pena
naval
an
environmental
engineering
professor
at
the
federal
university
of
tocantins
wildlife
too
is
under
threat
including
rare
hyacinth
macaws
maned
wolves
and
jaguars
that
call
the
shrinking
savanna
home
so
are
thousands
of
plants
fish
insects
and
other
creatures
found
nowhere
else
on
earth
many
of
which
are
only
beginning
to
be
studied
i
compare
it
to
the
burning
of
the
ancient
library
of
alexandria
said
mercedes
bustamante
an
ecologist
at
the
university
of
brasilia
you
lose
the
accumulated
evolutionary
record
of
thousands
of
years
that
never
can
be
farmers
see
the
cerrado
s
development
as
critical
to
global
food
security
and
their
nation
s
prosperity
brazil
s
agriculture
sector
grew
a
sizzling
percent
in
while
the
overall
economy
barely
budged
the
nation
s
ability
to
keep
producing
new
farmland
cheaply
has
given
it
an
edge
over
rivals
and
cemented
its
status
as
a
vital
supplier
to
the
world
s
tables
imagine
if
not
for
brazil
s
production
how
much
more
hunger
would
there
be
farmer
pansera
said
roughly
the
size
of
mexico
straddling
brazil
s
from
its
far
western
borders
with
paraguay
and
stretching
northeast
towards
the
atlantic
coast
the
cerrado
has
seen
about
half
of
its
native
forests
and
grasslands
converted
to
farms
pastures
and
urban
areas
over
the
past
years
deforestation
in
the
region
has
slowed
from
the
early
when
brazil
s
soy
boom
was
gaining
steam
still
farmers
continue
to
plow
under
vast
stretches
of
the
biome
propelled
largely
by
chinese
demand
for
brazilian
meat
and
grain
the
asian
nation
is
brazil
s
no
buyer
of
soybeans
to
fatten
its
own
hogs
and
chickens
china
is
also
a
major
purchaser
of
brazilian
pork
beef
and
poultry
to
satisfy
the
tastes
of
its
increasingly
affluent
consumers
rising
trade
tensions
between
china
and
the
united
states
have
only
deepened
that
connection
brazil
s
soybean
exports
by
value
to
china
are
up
percent
through
the
first
seven
months
of
the
year
as
chinese
buyers
have
canceled
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
contracts
with
suppliers
the
trend
bodes
well
for
producers
in
the
cerrado

frontier
region
known
as
matopiba
shorthand
for
the
northeastern
brazilian
states
of

according

ieg
fnp
that
compares
to
an
average
of

for
already
cleared

in
the

soy
planting
in
matopiba
has
more
than
doubled
over
the
past
decade
pansera
is
part
of
a
wave
of
industrious
transplants
from
southern
brazil
who
are
remaking
the
region
his
formal
education
stopped
at
middle
school
but
he
found
land
enough
in

to
match
his
big
ambitions
he
now
presides
over
nearly

square
kilometers
of
manicured

pansera

of
nearly

this

most

brazil

maggi
said

are
respectful
of

he

lawmakers
in
the
country

largely
rural

bloc
who
comprise
more
than
percent
of
the
nation
s
congress
have
led
a
rollback
of
environmental
laws
in
recent
years
those
efforts
include
a
loosening
of
brazil
s
landmark
forest
code
that
sets
requirements
for
preserving
native
vegetation
the
change
reduced
potential
penalties
for
farmers
ranchers
and
loggers
charged
with
past
illegal
deforestation
and
made
it
easier
for
landowners
to
clear
more

their

annual

up

cerrado
farmers
are
required
to
preserve
as
little
as

and
up

neighboring

those

said
elvison

coordinator

the
message
being

the
way

just
as

lamented
alencar
the

what
many
don

see
she
said
is
the
connection
between

that
long

according
to
the

among

unique
to

begin
with

says
ricardo
machado
a
zoology
professor
at
the

he
said
the

have
plummeted
due
to

more
than

far
the

have
agreed
to
support
measures
that
would
eliminate
native
vegetation
loss
in
the
cerrado
from
their
supply
chains
but
in
contrast
to
the
amazon
soy
moratorium
the
cerrado
manifesto
did
not
commit
signatories
to
halt

from

walmart

unilever
said
they
are
committed
to
achieving

by
meaning
any
destruction
in
one
region
would
be
offset
by

walmart
said
all
