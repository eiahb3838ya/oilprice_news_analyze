the

unit
of
the
china
communications
construction
company
cccc
on
tuesday
signed
an
agreement
to
work
with
commodities
trader
zenrock
group
to
purchase
fuel
marine
construction
development
co
mcd
which
is
involved
in
major
infrastructure
projects
around
the
world
as
part
of
china
s
belt
and
road
initiative
wants
to
streamline
its
process
for
buying
fuel
said
chief
financial
officer
jin
xinxiang
in
the
past
our
oil
procurement
activities
have
been
very
segregated
into
individual
projects
with
this
new
joint
venture
initiative
it
is
envisaged
we
will
have
all
oil
procurement
activities
centralised
under
one
umbrella
jin
told
reuters
we
own
over
construction
vessels
around
the
world
which
consume
close
to
about
tonnes
of
marine
fuel
on
average
each
year
and
we
have
many
more
ships
on
hire
said
jin
adding
that
the
group
s
oil
requirements
go
beyond
just
marine
fuels
and
include
crude
oil
refined
products
and
bitumen
used
in
road
construction
he
also
said
the
company
could
use
the
joint
venture
to
sell
oil
it
may
receive
as
payment
on
some
of
its
infrastructure
projects
in
countries
where
payment
issues
may
arise
and
there
is
a
need
for
payment
in
oil
for
example
we
want
to
prepare
ourselves
so
we
are
able
to
monetize
that
said
jin
zenrock
an
oil
and
petrochemicals
trader
with
offices
in
china
and
indonesia
hopes
the
deal
will
help
its
expansion
outside
asia
zenrock
president
xie
chun
said
the
firm
is
looking
to
tap
into
markets
including
africa
the
middle
east
europe
and
the
united
states
because
asia
s
growing
refining
capacity
is
expected
to
leave
the
region
with
an
excess
supply
of
refined
products
such
as
gasoline
and
diesel
established
in
zenrock
expects
its
trading
volumes
to
reach
million
tonnes
of
crude
oil
and
oil
products
in
with
billion
in
revenues
up
from
million
tonnes
of
traded
volumes
and
billion
in
revenues
the
year
before
through
the
joint
venture
we
expect
turnover
to
be
increased
to
billion
in
with
a
percent
increase
in
traded
volumes
