u.s.-china trade war poses oil demand shock in 2019 - bp
singapore
reuters
sanctions
on
iran
will
tighten
global
oil
supplies
sharply
until
the
end
of
the
year
but
a
threat
to
world
demand
looms
in
from
the
trade
war
the
head
of
bp
s
oil
trading
in
asia
said
we
re
moving
into
the
tightest
part
of
the
of
iran
sanctions
is
the
main
factor
as
the
market
will
tighten
substantially
from
now
to
janet
kong
chief
executive
of
integrated
supply
and
trading
eastern
hemisphere
at
bp
told
reuters
saudi
arabia
and
russia
won
t
add
significantly
more
oil
to
the
market
because
of
a
lack
of
capacity
a
top
iranian
official
said
on
monday
predicting
prices
will
probably
rise
further
sanctions
on
venezuela
are
also
exacerbating
a
production
decline
there
while
outages
in
nigeria
and
libya
have
further
crimped
supplies
kong
said
with
brent
supported
at
above
a
barrel
the
market
fundamentals
in
the
short
term
look
very
bullish
and
positive
due
to
supply
shocks
but
over
time
when
supply
catches
up
and
the
shock
to
demand
becomes
more
evident
the
market
will
go
through
another
round
of
next
year
she
said
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
china
and
the
united
states
have
imposed
tariffs
on
each
other
s
imports
in
an
escalating
trade
war
that
has
rattled
global
markets
and
raised
concerns
of
a
slowdown
in
world
economies
and
commodities
demand
next
year
going
into
i
worry
about
the
impact
of
the
trade
war
manifesting
itself
slowly
kong
said
the
trade
war
impact
has
not
really
shown
up
in
the
data
anywhere
but
it
will
show
up
gradually
over
time
so
the
supply
shock
is
very
sharp
and
prompt
while
the
impact
from
trade
war
is
boiling
over
analysts
and
the
international
monetary
fund
have
forecast
a
percent
to
percent
drop
in
world
gross
domestic
product
growth
next
year
she
said
the
international
energy
agency
said
in
its
monthly
oil
report
that
global
oil
demand
is
set
to
top
million
bpd
next
year
although
emerging
market
crises
and
trade
disputes
could
dent
this
figure
the
trump
administration
wants
intellectual
property
protection
reducing
subsidies
to
chinese
soes
enterprises
and
open
market
access
by
all
businesses
which
are
difficult
in
my
view
for
the
chinese
government
to
agree
to
kong
said
so
it
s
very
likely
this
war
will
drag
on
for
a
long
