oil
markets
opened
strongly
on
tuesday
with
brent
crude
remaining
near
a
reached
the
previous
session
oil
markets
have
been
driven
up
by
looming
sanctions
against
iran
and
an
unwillingness
or
inability
by
middle
east
dominated
producer
cartel
opec
and
russia
to
raise
output
brent
crude
futures
were
at
per
barrel
at
gmt
up
by
cents
or
percent
from
their
last
close
this
was
not
far
off
the
november
high
of
a
barrel
reached
the
previous
day
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
futures
were
at
a
barrel
up
cents
or
percent
from
their
last
settlement
the
united
states
from
november
will
target
iran
s
oil
exports
with
sanctions
and
washington
is
putting
pressure
on
governments
and
companies
around
the
world
to
fall
in
line
and
cut
purchases
from
tehran
it
is
clear
that
the
impact
of
forthcoming
sanctions
on
iranian
oil
exports
will
be
deeper
than
many
had
expected
said
peter
kiernan
lead
energy
analyst
at
the
economist
intelligence
unit
in
singapore
president
donald
trump
has
demanded
that
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
of
which
iran
is
a
member
and
russia
increase
their
supplies
to
make
up
for
the
expected
fall
in
iranian
exports
opec
and
russia
however
have
so
far
rebuffed
such
calls
we
would
expect
oil
to
trend
higher
in
the
coming
weeks
this
is
because
opec
have
essentially
ignored
president
trump
s
call
to
raise
output
to
help
lower
prices
said
ashley
kelty
oil
and
gas
research
analyst
at
financial
services
firm
cantor
fitzgerald
we
don
t
believe
opec
can
actually
raise
output
significantly
in
the
near
term
as
the
physical
spare
capacity
in
the
system
is
not
that
high
kelty
said
we
can
see
oil
trending
higher
perhaps
to
but
would
not
expect
to
see
oil
anytime
soon

added
bank

merrill
lynch
said
it
has
lifted
its
average
brent
crude
oil
price
forecast
for
from
per
barrel
to
per
barrel
while
it
increased
its
wti
crude
oil
forecast
by
to
per
barrel
in
the
bank
said
the
iran
factor
may
dominate
the
market
and
cause
a
crude
price
spike
although
it
added
that
emerging
market
demand
concerns
could
reappear
indian
refiners
struggling
from
high
crude
feedstock
prices
and
a
sliding
rupee
are
planning
to
reduce
oil
imports
in
what
could
be
a
first
sign
that
high
prices
are
starting
to
hurt
demand
