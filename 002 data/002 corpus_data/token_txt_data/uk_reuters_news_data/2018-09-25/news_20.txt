new

reuters
energy
stocks
climbed
on
tuesday
as
oil
prices
surged
above
a
barrel
but
shares
ended
lower
as
chipmakes
fell
on
ratings
downgrades
and
shares
lost
ground
ahead
of
an
expected
federal
reserve
interest
rate
hike
the
dollar
weakened
as
the
expected
fed
rate
hike
has
already
been
priced
in
by
investors
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
fell
points
or
percent
to
the
s
p
lost
points
or
percent
to
and
the
nasdaq
composite
added
points
or
percent
to
the
ftseurofirst
index
rose
percent
and
msci
gauge
of
stocks
across
the
globe
gained
percent
a
lot
of
the
noise
around
trade
and
anything
else
around
politics
really
hasn
t
suppressed
consumer
confidence
nearly
to
the
degree
that
the
other
factors
have
boosted
it

mike
dowdall
investment
strategist

bmo
global
asset
management
in
chicago
brent
crude
futures
touched
a
high
at
a
barrel
catapulted
by
imminent
sanctions
on
iranian
crude
exports
and
the
apparent
reluctance
of
opec
and
russia
to
raise
output
to
offset
the
potential
hit
to
global
supply
oil
prices
pared
gains
however
after
president
donald
trump
in
a
speech
before
the
united
nations
called
on
opec
again
to
boost
crude
output
the
combination
of
tight
supply
healthy
demand
falling
global
inventories
down
from
already
levels
and
anemic
spare
capacity
helps
support
an
oil
price
which
could
end
the
year
above
richard
robinson
manager
of
ashburton
s
global
energy
fund
said
crude
fell
percent
to
per
barrel
brent
was
last
at
up
percent
on
the
day
the
rise
in
energy
shares
however
failed
to
squash
broader
market
pessimism
a
day
after
washington
and
beijing
imposed
new
tariffs
on
each
other
s
goods
and
chinese
vice
commerce
minister
wang
shouwen
accused
the
united
states
of
putting
a
knife
to
china
s
there
are
other
big
worries
for
investors
too
not
least
the
timing
and
pace
of
central
bank
policy
tightening
the
fed
is
widely
expected
to
hike
rates
when
it
ends
its
policy
meeting
on
wednesday
in
a
third
increase
in
european
central
bank
president
mario
draghi
on
monday
raised
expectations
the
euro
zone
will
also
start
to
normalize
policy
over
the
coming
year
by
referring
to
relatively
vigorous
underlying
inflation
and
brisk
wage
growth
treasury
yields
held
near
a
new
high
above
percent
after
a
billion
government
debt
sale
on
tuesday
benchmark
notes
last
fell
in
price
to
yield
percent
from
percent
late
on
monday
the
dollar
weakened
ahead
of
the
fed
s
policy
decision
as
investors
have
already
priced
in
two
more
interest
rate
increases
this
year
and
some
in
leaving
little
room
for
further
currency
gains
the
dollar
index
fell
percent
with
the
euro
up
percent
to
since
the
dollar
has
declined
percent
against
the
index
s
basket
of
six
major
currencies
the
dollar
appears
vulnerable
given
extended
speculative
bullish
positioning
against
most
of
the
currencies
and
considerable
tightening
already
reflected
in
fed
funds
futures
said
eric
theoret
currency
strategist
at
scotiabank
in
toronto
the
drifting
dollar
helped
gold
