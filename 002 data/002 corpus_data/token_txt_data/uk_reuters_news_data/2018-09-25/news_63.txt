berlin
reuters
it
is
extremely
important
that
the
european
union
develop
its
own
battery
cell
production
to
secure
its
role
in
the
automotive
industry
as
it
shifts
to
electric
mobility
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
if
china
is
opening
the
first
battery
cell
production
here
then
that
is
nice
then
battery
cells
are
being
made
in
europe
too
but
i
don
t
know
whether
it
was
our
dream
that
we
can
not
do
that
ourselves
in
the
european
union
she
said
at
an
industry
conference
on
tuesday
i
am
still
advocating
that
we
develop
the
strategic
ability
to
produce
battery
cells
too
i
believe
that
will
be
extremely
important
in
the
next
decades
