the

the

concerns
is
a
negative
factor
for

some
markets
like

s
have
positive
factors
to
fall
back
on
like
the
weaker

but
such
support
could
be
negated
if

in

in

the

stood
little
changed
at
the

surged
to
a
peak
of

central

he
sees

unwinding

ecb
program

to

the

ahead
of
the
fed

expected

hike
the

weaker
at
per

in
onshore
trade
it
dipped
in
offshore
trade
on
monday
which
was
a
holiday
in
mainland
markets
after
reports
that
beijing
was
scrapping
plans
to
attend
trade
talks
this
week
the

a
proxy
of

a

appetite
retreated

monday
brent
crude
oil
futures
hovered
near
the
highest
since
november
scaled
overnight
oil
prices
had
rallied
more
than
percent
on
monday
after
russian
and
opec
leader
saudi
arabia
ruled
out
on
sunday
any
immediate
additional
increase
in
crude
output
effectively
rebuffing
president
donald
trump
s
calls
for
action
to
cool
the
market
we
would
expect
oil
to
trend
higher
in
the
coming
weeks
this
is
because
opec
have
essentially
ignored
president
trump
s
call
to
raise
output
to
help
lower
prices
said
ashley
kelty
oil
and
gas
research
analyst
at
financial
services
firm
cantor
fitzgerald
we
don
t
believe
opec
can
actually
raise
output
significantly
in
the
near
term
as
the
physical
spare
capacity
in
the
system
is
not
that
high
kelty
said
furthermore
the
united
states
from
november
will
target
iran
s
oil
exports
with
sanctions
and
washington
is
putting
pressure
on
governments
and
companies
around
the
world
to
fall
in
line
and
cut
