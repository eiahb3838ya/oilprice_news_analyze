european
shares
climbed
on
tuesday
as
oil
prices
above
a
barrel
lifted
energy
stocks
while
stocks
slid

in
chipmakers
and

ahead
of
an
expected
federal

hike

a
lot
of
the

around

anything

around

really
hasn

suppressed

nearly
to

brent
crude
futures
shot
to
highs
of
almost
a
barrel
catapulted
by
imminent
sanctions
on
iranian
crude
exports
and
the
apparent
reluctance
of
opec
and
russia
to
raise
output
to
offset
the
potential
hit
to
global
supply
the
combination
of
tight
supply
healthy
demand
falling
global
inventories
down
from
already
levels
and
anemic
spare
capacity
helps
support
an
oil
price

chinese

accused
the

of
putting

to
china
s
there
are
other
big
worries
for
investors
too
not

the
timing
and
pace
of

policy
tightening

is
poised
to
hike

for
a
third
time
in

european
central

president
mario
draghi
on
monday
raised
expectations
the
euro
zone
will
also
start
to
normalize
policy
over
the
coming
year
by
referring
to
relatively
vigorous
underlying
inflation
and
brisk
wage
growth
that

the

weakened
ahead
of
the

policy
meeting
as
investors
have
already
priced
in
two
more
interest

increases
this
year
and
some
in
leaving
little
room
for
further
currency
gains
the

up

to
since
the

has
declined
percent
against
that
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
appears
vulnerable
given
extended
speculative
bullish
positioning
against
most
of
the

and
considerable
tightening
