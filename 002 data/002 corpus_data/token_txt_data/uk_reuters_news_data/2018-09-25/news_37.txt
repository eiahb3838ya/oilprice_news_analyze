reuters
india
has
for
the
first
time
allowed
state
refiners
to
buy
percent
of
their
oil
imports
in
tankers
arranged
by
the
seller
a
document
reviewed
by
reuters
showed
enabling
them
to
swiftly
tap
cheaper
cargoes
the
move
will
help
refiners
in
iran
s
second
biggest
oil
market
to
boost
purchases
from
alternative
sources
as
president
donald
trump
prepares
to
halt
iranian
oil
sales
through
a
new
set
of
sanctions
from
the
measure
is
part
of
a
series
of
attempts
by
the
world
s
oil
importer
and
consumer
to
cut
its
surging
oil
import
bill
in
the
face
of
rising
oil
prices
and
a
weaker
indian
rupee
india
had
previously
allowed
state
refiners
to
buy
only
percent
of
their
estimated
million
tonnes
of
oil
imports
in
the
current
fiscal
year
to
march
on
a
cost
insurance
and
freight
cif
basis
meaning
the
seller
arranges
the
vessel
and
insurance
the
rest
was
largely
procured
on
a
free
on
board
fob
basis
to
help
indian
shipping
lines
and
insurers
india
s
shipping
ministry
told
the
country
s
oil
ministry
about
the
move
in
a
letter
dated
sept
advance
noc
no
objection
certificate
is
now
granted
to
oil
marketing
companies
to
further
import
crude
up
to
million
tonnes
balance
percent
it
said
more
than
doubling
the
percentage
of
cif
cargoes
the
refiners
can
buy
gives
them
much
greater
flexibility
to
take
advantage
of
more
speculative
or
distressed
sellers
who
need
to
sell
their
oil
quickly
this
also
suggests
that
indian
refiners
will
be
in
a
position
to
purchase
more
oil
which
is
mostly
available
on
a
cif
basis
helping
to
compensate
for
the
loss
of
iranian
oil
supplies
crude
is
currently
trading
at
a
discount
of
about
a
barrel
to
the
brent
global
benchmark
price
basically
that
the
new
higher
limit
has
increased
flexibility
for
us
to
look
at
opportunities
that
are
available
around
the
world
and
buy
most
economic
cargoes
said
one
source
at
an
indian
refinery
who
asked
not
to
be
named
it
was
difficult
for
us
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
when
traders
or
companies
are
going
around
with
material
in
the
ships
this
source
said
the
shipping
ministry
said
in
the
letter
it
would
review
the
outcome
of
this
liberalized
offer
before
deciding
on
policy
for
the
next
fiscal
year
previous
approval
for
lower
volumes
was
given
before
iran
sanctions
were
announced
but
the
situation
has
changed
now
for
example
we
can
not
buy
oil
on
an
fob
basis
said
another
source
at
one
of
the
state
refiners
record
high
retail
prices
for
petrol
and
diesel
are
risking
a
populist
backlash
which
could
hurt
prime
minister
narendra
modi
s
government
ahead
of
general
elections
next
year
india
s
oil
ministry
and
the
four
refiners
indian
