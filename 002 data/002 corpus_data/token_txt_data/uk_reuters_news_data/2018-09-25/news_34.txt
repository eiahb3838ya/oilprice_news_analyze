above the russian arctic circle, prisoners of putin's pension reform
vorkuta
russia
reuters
russian
railway
worker
andrey
bugera
had
a
singular
goal
get
to
pension
age
so
he
can
leave
the
polluted
frigid
coal
mining
town
above
the
arctic
circle
where
he
works
and
move
south
to
live
out
even
a
brief
bit
of
retirement
in
comfort
but
now
that
president
vladimir
putin
has
said
he
plans
to
raise
the
retirement
age
by
five
years
bugera
fears
this
will
never
happen
in
his
city
of
vorkuta
a
place
so
isolated
it
can
not
be
reached
by
road
temperatures
dip
below
minus
degrees
celsius
in
the
winter
and
clouds
of
coal
dust
can
turn
the
white
snow
black
thin
polluted
air
scarce
sunlight
and
winters
lasting
up
to
months
weigh
heavily
on
the
average
life
expectancy
in
the
city
labelled
the
eighth
most
polluted
in
russia
by
the
government
last
year
in
june
in
the
space
of
two
weeks
three
of
bugera
s
friends
died
before
reaching
the
age
of
one
of
my
colleagues
came
home
from
his
night
shift
and
just
didn
t
wake
up
left
his
family
three
kids
he
was
years
old
it
was
his
heart
a
blood
clot
so
how
can
they
even
think
about
us
retiring
at
bugera
said
though
one
long
time
concession
in
the
far
north
has
been
early
retirement
to
help
attract
workers
to
its
harsh
environment
the
government
s
planned
reforms
will
raise
the
pension
age
by
five
years
to
for
men
and
for
women
yet
males
born
in
in
komi
republic
where
vorkuta
is
located
on
average
are
expected
to
live
to
government
data
shows
or
four
years
short
of
the
proposed
new
retirement
age
in
the
rest
of
russia
the
retirement
age
is
set
to
rise
to
for
men
and
for
women
making
matters
little
better
as
the
nationwide
life
expectancy
for
men
was
years
old
in
government
data
shows
two
years
ago
bugera
and
his
wife
used
their
savings
to
buy
an
apartment
in
sokol
a
small
riverside
town
in
the
vologda
region
in
central
russia
they
have
spent
their
holidays
there
since
gradually
renovating
the
apartment
in
the
hope
of
one
day
leaving
the
arctic
now
bugera
said
he
has
given
up
thinking
about
ever
leaving
vorkuta
with
this
pension
reform
with
everything
pushed
back
i
feel
like
i
ll
never
get
out
bugera
said
the
government
s
decision
to
raise
the
retirement
age
is
part
of
efforts
to
balance
russia
s
creaking
finances
after
four
years
of
weak
growth
made
worse
by
sanctions
but
it
is
proving
its
most
unpopular
move
in
more
than
a
decade
putin
s
grip
on
power
is
not
directly
threatened
because
he
has
no
real
challengers
but
his
popularity
rating
has
slipped
and
once
loyal
putin
voters
are
starting
to
express
scorn
for
their
rulers
around
people
lived
in
vorkuta
in
the
most
coming
from
across
the
soviet
union
in
search
of
the
high
wages
miners
in
the
desolate
city
used
to
earn
now
just
four
of
its
coal
mines
remain
and
the
population
has
fallen
closer
to
districts
of
empty
blackened
apartment
blocks
with
collapsed
roofs
and
yards
littered
with
rubble
surround
central
vorkuta
with
no
roads
leading
out
of
the
city
it
is
too
expensive
for
most
residents
to
take
their
belongings
with
them
when
they
leave
in
abandoned
apartments
furniture
rots
and
clothes
and
books
lie
strewn
across
the
floor
when
i
leave
i
ll
take
my
guns
and
my
guitar
that
s
it
people
drop
everything
and
go
said
sergei
a
coal
miner
travelling
to
vorkuta
by
train
a
doctor
at
a
district
hospital
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
said
she
did
not
want
to
stay
in
a
town
where
everything
was
being
shut
she
was
due
to
retire
next
year
and
like
bugera
planned
to
move
to
a
home
she
had
prepared
for
her
family
in
the
south
with
this
reform
probably
none
of
that
is
going
to
happen
i
don
t
know
but
i
have
no
more
strength
will
anything
to
live
in
a
town
like
this
where
everything
is
in
ruins
she
said
you
walk
around
like
a
bugera
attended
protests
in
vorkuta
against
the
pension
reforms
the
events
were
relatively
small
attracting
around
people
in
july
and
are
expected
to
dwindle
as
the
snows
set
in
next
month
if
we
don
t
manage
to
change
anything
with
our
protests
at
least
i
ll
leave
some
sort
of
base
for
my
children
bugera
said
a
muted
anger
was
registered
in
regional
elections
on
however
vorkuta
saw
a
turnout
of
just
percent
election
commission
data
showed
the
presidential
election
which
took
place
in
march
before
the
proposed
pension
reform
was
announced
saw
a
turnout
of
percent
this
pension
reform
has
become
the
final
straw
people
have
summed
everything
up
and
understood
that
this
is
the
final
straw
for
them
said
former
miner
and
security
guard
alexander
golyanchuk
referring
to
the
low
election
turnout
we
live
in
tough
conditions
and
we
don
t
live
for
very
long
now
they
re
taking
away
our
pensions
as
well
he
added
walking
through
vorkuta
olga
lebedeva
said
she
previously
had
four
years
to
go
until
her
pension
now
they
ve
added
five
so
now
it
s
nine
i
ll
grin
and
bear
it
