iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
on
tuesday
criticized
washington
for
its
hostile
policy
towards
his
country
and
said
the
approach
was
doomed
to
failure
rouhani
in
a
speech
to
the
united
nations
general
assembly
said
the
united
states
had
waged
economic
war
against
iran
by
reimposing
unilateral
sanctions
which
were
lifted
under
the
country
s
multinational
nuclear
deal
in
return
for
tehran
curbing
its
nuclear
program
the
united
states
policy
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
has
been
wrong
from
the
beginning
and
its
approach
of
resisting
the
wishes
of
the
iranian
people
as
manifested
in
numerous
elections
is
doomed
to
failure
rouhani
said
president
donald
trump
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
the
pact
in
may
and
his
administration
reimposed
sanctions
on
iran
in
august
harsher
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
and
banking
sector
are
expected
in
november
the
economic
war
that
the
united
states
has
initiated
under
the
rubric
of
new
sanctions
not
only
targets
the
iranian
people
but
also
entails
harmful
repercussions
for
the
people
of
other
countries
and
that
war
has
caused
a
disruption
in
the
state
of
global
trade
rouhani
said
what
iran
says
is
clear
no
war
no
sanctions
no
threats
no
bullying
just
acting
according
to
the
law
and
the
fulfilment
of
mounting
pressure
from
the
trump
administration
combined
with
discontent
among
many
iranians
at
the
state
of
the
economy
are
rattling
the
islamic
republic
with
little
sign
that
its
leaders
have
the
answers
officials
and
analysts
say
the
rial
has
lost
percent
of
its
value
against
the
dollar
since
april
iran
has
blamed
sanctions
for
the
currency
fall
saying
the
measures
amount
to
a
political
psychological
and
economic
war
on
tehran
to
pile
on
the
pain
washington
says
all
countries
must
end
crude
imports
from
iran
by
hitting
the
oil
sales
that
generate
percent
of
the
country
s
income
iran
says
this
level
of
cuts
will
never
happen
tehran
has
suggested
it
could
take
military
action
in
the
gulf
to
block
other
countries
oil
exports
in
retaliation
for
sanctions
intended
to
halt
its
sales
of
crude
washington
maintains
a
fleet
in
the
gulf
that
protects
oil
shipping
routes
the
security
of
the
persian
gulf
and
the
strait
of
hormuz
has
always
been
important
for
us
we
will
confront
any
and
all
disruptive
efforts
in
this
critical
waterway
in
the
future
said
rouhani
the
strait
of
hormuz
is
a
strategic
artery
linking
middle
east
crude
producers
to
key
markets
in
the
europe
north
america
and
beyond
a
third
of
the
world
s
seaborne
oil
passes
through
the
strait
in
southern
iran
trump
in
his
annual
speech
said
he
would
keep
up
economic
pressure
on
tehran
to
try
to
force
a
change
in
its
behaviour
but
rouhani
said
iran
had
no
intention
of
succumbing
to
the
pressure
the
united
states
understanding
of
international
relations
is
authoritarian
its
understanding
of
power
not
of
legal
and
legitimate
authority
is
reflected
in
bullying
and
imposition
rouhani
said
no
state
and
nation
can
be
brought
to
the
negotiating
table
by
force
said
the
pragmatist
president
adding
that
iran
did
not
want
any
war
our
proposal
is
clear
commitment
for
commitment
violation
for
violation
threat
for
threat
and
step
for
step
instead
of
talk
for
talk
he
said
rouhani
expressed
iran
s
willingness
to
improve
ties
with
the
regional
countries
sunni
muslim
saudi
arabia
has
been
at
loggerheads
with
shi
ite
iran
for
decades
fighting
a
proxy
war
in
the
middle
east
and
beyond
that
has
influenced
conflicts
in
iraq
syria
lebanon
and
yemen
riyadh
and
its
gulf
allies
have
hailed
trump
s
decision
to
exit
the
nuclear
deal
and
to
reimpose
sanctions
on
tehran
reflecting
their
concern
about
iran
s
influence
in
the
region
we
believe
in
the
formation
of
a
collective
mechanism
for
the
persian
gulf
region
with
the
presence
and
participation
of
all
regional
countries
