swedish
oil
firm
lundin
petroleum
expects
to
increase
its
resource
estimate
for
the
alta
discovery
in
norway
s
arctic
region
following
a
successful
production
test
finding
significant
oil
reserves
in
the
norwegian
arctic
has
been
challenging
for
oil
firms
but
alta
is
among
the
exceptions
the
company
and
its
partners
are
considering
developing
the
discovery
as
a
subsea
field
connected
to
a
floating
production
and
storage
vessel
and
may
also
tie
in
the
smaller
gohta
find
which
is
located
nearby
prior
to
the
production
test
the
combined
gross
resource
range
for
the
alta
and
gohta
discoveries
was
estimated
at
between
and
million
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
these
positive
results
are
expected
to
increase
the
alta
resource
estimate
and
reduce
the
uncertainty
range

we
have
significantly
advanced
our
understanding
of
this
complex
carbonate
reservoir
the
development
of

we
will
now
concentrate
our
efforts
on
further
defining

route
to
commercialisation
and
progressing
