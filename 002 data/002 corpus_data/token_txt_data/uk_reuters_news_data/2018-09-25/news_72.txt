eleven

ago
on
monday
the
price
of
brent
crude
closed
just
below
per
barrel
not
far
from
where
it
is
today
three
days
later
brent
closed
above
for
the
first
time
in
history
less
than
months
after
that
prices
closed
at
an
high
of
past
prices
are
not
necessarily
a
guide
to
the
future
but
the
events
of
are
a
reminder
that
price
moves
are
highly
especially
around
turning
points
in
the
cycle
price
moves
tend
to
accelerate
in
the
to
cyclical
peaks
and
troughs
as
the
market
struggles
to
overcome
a
worsening
deficit
or
surplus
as
a
result
oil
prices
tend
to
rise
far
higher
and
fall
much
further
than
commentators
thought
possible
just
a
few
months
earlier
the
current
situation
in
the
global
economy
and
the
oil
market
has
many
similarities
to
what
happened
in
and
in
the
earlier
episode
the
global
economy
had
been
expanding
strongly
for
several
years
with
rapid
growth
in
oil
consumption
the
economic
cycle
peaked
in
december
though
that
was
not
evident
until
about
a
year
afterwards
and
oil
prices
continued
rising
for
another
seven
months
yields
on
treasury
notes
peaked
around
june
and
equity
markets
hit
their
pinnacle
in
october
most
of
the
other
major
industrial
economies
tipped
into
recession
in
the
second
half
of
or
the
first
half
of
in
the
oil
market
persistent
concerns
about
demand
destruction
were
raised
but
dismissed
by
many
participants
and
validated
only
after
prices
peaked
the
introduction
of
new
standards
for
distillate
fuel
oil
in
the
united
states
led
to
concerns
about
the
availability
of
enough
sweet
crude
there
were
mounting
concerns
about
the
exhaustion
of
opec
s
spare
capacity
and
the
organisation
s
ability
to
add
more
barrels
to
meet
demand
from
refiners
throughout
and
early
opec
leaders
continued
to
insist
the
oil
market
was
adequately
supplied
and
they
would
make
additional
barrels
available
if
refiners
requested
them
but
the
brent
market
moved
into
a
sharp
backwardation
in
the
second
half
of
and
the
first
four
months
of
indicating
traders
were
concerned
about
oil
availability
in
september
opec
agreed
to
increase
its
collective
production
by
barrels
per
day
from
the
start
of
november
citing
the
tightness
in
fuel
markets
and
the
shift
in
crude
futures
into
backwardation
in
december
however
opec
s
conference
judged
the
market
remained
well
supplied
and
that
crude
and
product
stocks
were
at
comfortable
levels
and
decided
not
to
increase
output
further
in
march
the
conference
continued
to
judge
the
market
well
supplied
noting
growing
downside
risks
in
the
world
economy
and
blamed
the
continued
rise
in
oil
prices
on
factors
especially
speculators
in
may
the
organisation
s
issued
a
statement
saying
there
is
clearly
no
shortage
of
oil
in
the
market
and
blaming
speculative
funds
for
the
increasing
volatility
in
crude
oil
the
organisation
promised
to
be
proactive
in
monitoring
developments
and
act
if
necessary
to
ensure
a
stable
and
balanced
market
but
did
not
promise
additional
barrels
prices
continued
to
accelerate
higher
and
became
increasingly
volatile
with
price
moves
becoming
frequent
and
many
traders
pulling
back
from
making
markets
due
to
the
increase
in
risk
opec
insisted
throughout
that
oil
supplies
were
adequate
saudi
arabia
and
other
members
would
provide
more
oil
if
refiners
asked
but
that
prices
were
being
driven
by
factors
eventually
the
backwardation
began
to
break
down
in
may
and
spot
prices
started
to
fall
from
early
july
as
the
financial
and
economic
outlook
deteriorated
with
the
intensification
of
the
financial
crisis
in
september
the
global
economy
headed
deeper
into
recession
through
the
second
half
of
the
year
and
in
the
first
half
of
could
the
same
sequence
of
events
play
out
in
the
economy
and
financial
markets
are
again
at
a
relatively
late
stage
in
the
current
cyclical
expansion
in
the
rest
of
the
world
the
global
outlook
is
softening
with
the
balance
of
risks
tilted
towards
the
downside
according
to
many
forecasters
oil
consumption
growth
has
been
strong
but
may
be
starting
to
soften
though
as
usual
this
will
not
be
certain
until
after

but
some
market
participants
are
sceptical
about
the
amount
and
the
quality
the
joint

of

and
producers
concluded
on
sunday
the
overall
balance
between

and

remains
healthy

amassed
a

position
in

amounting
to
