told

on

to
follow
poland
s
example
and
not
rely
on

for
its
energy

which
could
make

developing

reliance
on
a
single
foreign
supplier
can
leave
nations
vulnerable
to
extortion
and
intimidation
and
that
is
why
we
congratulate
european
states
such
as
poland
for
leading
construction
of
a
baltic
pipeline
so
that
nations
are
not
dependent
on
russia

general

germany
will
become
totally
dependent
on
russian
energy
