president
donald
trump
and
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
exchanged
taunts
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
on
tuesday
with
trump
vowing
more
sanctions
against
tehran
and
rouhani
suggesting
his
american
counterpart
suffers
from
a
weakness
of
trump
used
his
annual
address
to
the
united
nations
to
attack
iran
s
corrupt
dictatorship
praise
last
year
s
bogeyman
north
korea
and
lay
down
a
defiant
message
that
he
will
reject
globalism
and
protect
american
interests
but
much
of
his
address
was
aimed
squarely
at
iran
which
the
united
states
accuses
of
harbouring
nuclear
ambitions
and
fomenting
instability
in
the
middle
east
through
its
support
for
militant
groups
in
syria
lebanon
and
yemen
iran
s
leaders
sow
chaos
death
and
destruction
trump
told
the
gathering
in
the
hall
they
do
not
respect
their
neighbours
or
borders
or
the
sovereign
rights
of
rouhani
addressing
the
assembled
world
leaders
later
sharply
criticized
trump
s
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
he
said
he
had
no
need
for
a
photo
opportunity
with
trump
and
suggested
the
president
s
pull
back
from
global
institutions
was
a
character
defect
confronting
multilateralism
is
not
a
sign
of
strength
rather
it
is
a
symptom
of
the
weakness
of
intellect
it
betrays
an
inability
in
understanding
a
complex
and
interconnected
world
he
said
trump
s
address
was
met
largely
by
silence
from
world
leaders
still
not
comfortable
with
views
that
have
strained
relationships
with
traditional
allies
worldwide
his
speech
while
delivered
in
a
fashion
was
nonetheless
a
thunderous
recitation
of
his
america
first
policies
he
has
disrupted
the
world
order
by
withdrawing
the
united
states
from
the
nuclear
deal
and
the
paris
climate
accord
and
threatened
to
punish
nato
nations
for
not
paying
more
for
their
common
defence
we
will
never
surrender
america
s
sovereignty
to
an
unelected
unaccountable
global
bureaucracy
trump
said
in
language
popular
with
his
political
base
america
is
governed
by
americans
we
reject
the
ideology
of
globalism
and
we
embrace
the
doctrine
of
besides
calling
out
iran
trump
also
criticized
china
for
its
trade
practices
but
made
no
mention
of
russia
s
interference
in
syria
s
war
or
its
suspected
meddling
in
elections
rouhani
was
defiant
in
his
speech
to
the
world
body
what
iran
says
is
clear
no
war
no
sanctions
no
threats
no
bullying
just
acting
according
to
the
law
and
the
fulfilment
of
obligations
rouhani
said
offering
an
alternative
view
when
it
was
his
turn
at
the
podium
french
president
emmanuel
macron
told
the
delegates
that
the
law
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
protectionism
and
isolationism
would
only
lead
to
heightened
tensions
defending
multilateralism
and
collective
action
he
said
nationalism
would
lead
to
failure
and
if
countries
stopped
defending
basic
principles
global
wars
would
return
i
do
not
accept
the
erosion
of
multilateralism
and
don
t
accept
our
history
unravelling
macron
told
the
assembly
at
times
raising
his
voice
our
children
are
macron
citing
the
example
of
iran
said
that
this
unilateralism
push
would
lead
directly
to
conflicts
trump
who
begins
his
political
rallies
with
boasts
about
his
economic
record
in
less
than
two
years
in
office
used
the
same
rhetoric
before
the
crowd
of
world
leaders
and
diplomats
telling
them
he
had
accomplished
more
than
almost
any
previous
president
the
remark
led
to
some
murmuring
and
laughter
in
the
crowd
taking
the
president
slightly
aback
i
didn
t
expect
that
reaction
but
that
s
ok
he
said
trump
attempted
to
drive
a
wedge
between
iran
s
leadership
and
its
people
days
after
an
attack
in
southwestern
iran
on
a
military
parade
killed
people
and
unsettled
the
country
in
remarks
to
reporters
on
his
way
to
his
speech
trump
said
he
would
not
meet
the
iranians
until
they
change
their
though
he
held
out
the
possibility
of
a
better
relationship
in
the
future
he
made
clear
economic
pressure
on
iran
would
not
abate
trump
s
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
addressing
a
group
called
united
against
a
nuclear
iran
called
the
accord
the
worst
diplomatic
debacle
in
american
history
and
had
a
warning
for
the
mullahs
in
if
you
cross
us
our
allies
or
our
partners
if
you
harm
our
citizens
if
you
continue
to
lie
cheat
and
deceive
yes
there
will
indeed
be
hell
to
pay
he
said
in
may
republican
trump
withdrew
the
united
states
from
the
deal
to
put
curbs
on
iran
s
nuclear
programme
in
exchange
for
easing
sanctions
france
britain
germany
russia
china
and
the
european
union
were
part
of
the
accord
with
iran
foes
for
decades
washington
and
tehran
have
been
increasingly
at
odds
since
may
the
accord
with
opec
member
iran
was
negotiated
under
democratic
president
barack
obama
additional
sanctions
will
resume
november
and
more
will
follow
and
we
are
working
with
countries
that
import
iranian
crude
oil
to
cut
their
purchases
substantially
trump
said
he
said
the
united
states
would
help
create
a
regional
strategic
alliance
between
gulf
nations
and
jordan
and
egypt
a
move
the
united
states
sees
as
a
bulwark
against
iran
trump
compared
relations
with
iran
to
what
he
called
improved
ties
with
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
who
trump
had
met
in
singapore
in
june
as
part
of
a
drive
to
get
pyongyang
to
give
up
its
nuclear
weapons
in
his
address
last
year
to
the
trump
insulted
kim
as
a
rocket
man
bent
on
nuclear
destruction
on
tuesday
trump
praised
kim
for
halting
nuclear
and
missile
tests
releasing
americans
held
prisoner
and
returning
some
remains
of
soldiers
killed
in
the
korean
war
the
two
leaders
are
trying
to
arrange
a
second
summit
trump
has
said
sanctions
on
north
korea
would
remain
for
now
delivering
a
harsh
message
to
opec
members
trump
called
on
them
to
stop
raising
oil
prices
and
to
pay
for
their
own
military
protection
he
threatened
to
limit
aid
only
to
countries
that
are
friendly
to
the
united
states
anwar
gargash
uae
minister
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
said
oil
prices
were
driven
only
by
markets
by
supply
and
demand
these
are
not
things
that
can
be
manipulated
by
a
decision
here
or
there
said
gargash
whose
country
is
an
opec
member
crude
oil
prices
shot
to
a
high
on
tuesday
catapulted
by
imminent
sanctions
on
iranian
crude
exports
and
the
apparent
reluctance
of
opec
and
russia
to
raise
output
to
offset
the
potential
hit
to
global
supply
