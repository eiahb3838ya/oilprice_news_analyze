berlin
reuters
the
german
government
will
hold
another
summit
on
friday
to
try
to
agree
a
way
to
tackle
pollution
from
diesel
vehicles
without
resorting
to
bans
with
the
transport
minister
saying
his
top
priority
is
to
ensure
owners
can
swap
old
cars
for
cleaner
ones
two
government
sources
said
on
tuesday
the
summit
would
be
held
in
the
german
chancellery
and
both
environment
minister
svenja
schulze
and
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
were
due
to
take
part
carmakers
and
german
government
representatives
failed
to
reach
a
compromise
on
sunday
over
potential
hardware
retrofits
for
older
diesel
vehicles
friday
s
meeting
will
take
place
ahead
of
a
deadline
at
the
end
of
september
set
by
chancellor
angela
merkel
to
stave
off
bans
on
older
vehicle
the
government
currently
envisages
offering
owners
of
affected
diesels
in
heavily
polluted
cities
options
including
exchanges
and
hardware
refits
according
to
a
document
seen
by
public
broadcaster
bayerischer
rundfunk
but
ministries
are
divided
over
the
issue
the
environment
ministry
favours
hardware
retrofits
costing
around
euros
per
vehicle
but
transport
minister
andreas
scheuer
favours
incentives
for
drivers
of
older
diesel
vehicles
to
trade
them
in
for
newer
models
to
curb
pollution
differences
over
how
to
tackle
the
problem
of
diesel
cars
with
excessive
emissions
have
strained
merkel
s
ruling
coalition
she
said
on
monday
that
a
coalition
committee
would
meet
on
to
discuss
matters
including
diesel
policy
the
subject
has
proved
controversial
as
pollution
levels
have
exceeded
european
union
limits
in
a
number
of
german
cities
but
the
government
is
worried
about
the
cost
of
replacing
or
upgrading
vehicles
and
the
impact
on
the
country
s
powerful
car
industry
its
biggest
source
of
export
income
environment
minister
svenja
schulze
said
on
twitter
the
problem
could
not
be
solved
without
retrofits
adding
hardware
retrofits
paid
for
by
manufacturers
are
the
best
and
most
fair
way
to
deal
with
the
diesel
scheuer
said
in
a
statement
on
tuesday
however
that
he
favoured
exchanging
older
diesel
cars
for
newer
cleaner
ones
regarding
possible
hardware
retrofits
for
german
diesel
vehicles
my
aim
is
to
make
sure
owners
do
not
pay
anything
my
aim
is
also
to
ensure
that
the
loss
of
value
of
used
diesel
cars
is
offset
by
carmakers
who
would
either
take
them
back
or
exchange
them
he
said
industry
sources
said
the
decline
in
value
would
only
be
compensated
for
in
regions
particularly
badly
affected
by
pollution
on
retrofits
industry
and
government
sources
said
the
aim
in
particular
was
to
refit
around
million
vans
as
it
was
relatively
easy
in
technical
terms
and
such
vehicles
were
on
the
roads
in
towns
often
and
for
long
periods
of
time
a
spokesman
for
automaker
daimler
said
the
company
was
working
on
a
package
of
measures
