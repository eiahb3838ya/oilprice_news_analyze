beijing
reuters
a
senior
chinese
official
said
on
tuesday
it
is
difficult
to
proceed
with
trade
talks
with
the
united
states
while
washington
is
putting
a
knife
to
china
s
neck
a
day
after
both
sides
heaped
fresh
tariffs
on
each
other
s
goods
when
the
talks
can
restart
would
depend
on
the
will
of
the
united
states
vice
commerce
minister
wang
shouwen
said
at
a
news
conference
in
beijing
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
and
retaliatory
taxes
by
beijing
on
billion
worth
of
products
including
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
kicked
in
on
monday
unnerving
global
financial
markets
now
that
the
united
states
has
adopted
such
a
huge
trade
restriction
measure
how
can
the
negotiations
proceed
it
s
not
an
equal
negotiation
wang
said
stressing
the
united
states
has
abandoned
its
mutual
understanding
with
china
the
chinese
government
s
top
diplomat
also
told
business
people
at
a
meeting
in
new
york
that
talks
could
not
take
place
against
the
backdrop
of
threats
and
pressure
the
foreign
ministry
said
certain
forces
in
the
united
states
have
been
making
groundless
criticisms
against
china
about
trade
and
security
issues
which
has
poisoned
the
atmosphere
for
ties
and
is
highly
irresponsible
state
councillor
wang
yi
was
quoted
as
saying
without
naming
anyone
if
this
continues
it
will
destroy
in
an
instant
the
gains
of
the
last
four
decades
of
relations
wang
told
members
of
the
business
council
and
national
committee
on
united
relations
representatives
there
included
blackstone
group
lp
and
chief
executive
stephen
schwarzman
and
mastercard
inc
chief
executive
ajay
banga
the
national
committee
on
united
relations
said
on
its
website
china
also
accused
the
united
states
of
engaging
in
trade
bullyism
and
said
washington
was
intimidating
other
countries
to
submit
to
its
will
according
to
a
white
paper
on
the
dispute
published
by
china
s
state
council
or
cabinet
on
monday
several
rounds
of
talks
in
recent
months
have
appeared
to
produce
no
breakthroughs
and
fresh
negotiations
which
had
been
expected
in
coming
weeks
have
been
shelved
after
beijing
reportedly
decided
late
last
week
not
to
send
a
delegation
to
washington
while
vice
commerce
minister
wang
said
he
still
hopes
there
is
a
way
out
if
both
sides
treat
each
other
with
sincerity
analysts
say
neither
side
looks
to
be
in
the
mood
to
compromise
in
the
increasingly
bitter
dispute
raising
the
risk
of
a
lengthy
battle
that
could
chill
the
global
economy
by
discouraging
business
investment
and
disrupting
trade
the
sharp
criticism
from
beijing
on
monday
suggests
that
china
might
prefer
to
wait
out
the
current
administration
rather
than
embarking
on
potentially
futile
negotiations
mizuho
bank
said
in
a
note
to
clients
given
these
developments
it
is
increasingly
likely
that
both
sides
will
not
resume
negotiations
for
some
time
at
least
until
there
is
a
noticeable
shift
in
the
political
mood
on
either
exporters
including
lng
suppliers
would
certainly
be
hurt
but
beijing
s
retaliation
would
provide
opportunities
to
other
countries
vice
commerce
minister
wang
said
adding
that
australia
is
an
important
source
of
the
fuel
for
china
china
is
a
big
and
powerful
nation
so
whether
it
is
a
confrontation
with
china
economically
or
militarily
it
would
come
at
a
huge
price
the
global
times
said
in
an
editorial
on
tuesday
as
such
it
is
an
attractive
prospect
for
other
countries
including
the
united
states
to
coexist
with
china
peacefully
said
the
newspaper
which
is
published
by
the
ruling
communist
party
s
people
s
daily
china
does
not
know
why
the
united
states
changed
its
mind
after
reaching
an
agreement
with
china
on
trade
earlier
wang
said
he
was
apparently
referring
to
talks
in
may
when
it
appeared
that
the
two
sides
had
sorted
out
a
framework
before
the
white
house
backed
away
luo
wen
a
vice
minister
at
the
ministry
of
industry
and
information
told
a
news
conference
that
the
government
is
aware
that
some
foreign
companies
are
considering
relocating
out
of
china
as
the
trade
row
threatens
to
heighten
their
risks
and
costs
but
he
said
the
government
is
working
to
accommodate
their
needs
and
reduce
their
tax
burdens
however
the
trade
war
risks
disrupting
global
supply
chains
and
throwing
them
into
chaos
luo
said
senior
officials
also
once
again
rejected
washington
s
accusations
that
china
forces
foreign
companies
to
share
their
technology
with
chinese
partners
adding
that
beijing
has
passed
a
rule
forbidding
government
entities
from
such
illegal
behavior
the
government
has
not
forced
this
and
a
lot
of
jvs
are
actually
performing
very
well
in
china
wang
said
giving
an
example
of
american
car
giant
ford
ford
produces
more
cars
and
makes
more
profits
in
china
through
its
jv
than
it
does
in
the
united
states
he
said
the
story
was
refiled
to
clarifiy
the
role
of
a
