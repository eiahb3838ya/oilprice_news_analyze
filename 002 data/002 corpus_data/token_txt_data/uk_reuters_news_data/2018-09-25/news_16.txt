forward
to
having
a
great
relationship
with
iran
but
it
won
t
happen
foes
for
decades
washington
and
tehran
have
been
increasingly
at
odds
since
may
when
the
republican
president
pulled
out
of
the
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
and
announced
sanctions
against
the
opec
member
the
accord

under
democratic

most
international
sanctions
against
tehran
in

for
iran
curbing
its

program
over
the
summer
trump
had
said
he
would
meet
with
rouhani
without
preconditions
to
negotiate
a
new
deal
an
offer
reiterated
on
sunday
by
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
and
extended
to
iran
s
supreme
leader
ayatollah
khamenei
rouhani
said
on
monday
tehran
would
not
talk
to
trump
until
the
united
states
returned
to

the
top
adviser
to
khamenei
ali
akbar
velayati
rejected
the

saying
trump
s
and
pompeo
s
dream
would
never
come
to
reality
the
irna

agency
said
despite
requests
i
have
no
plans
to
meet
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
maybe
someday
in
the
future
i
am
sure
he
is
an
absolutely
lovely
man
trump
wrote
in
a
post
on
twitter
earlier
on
tuesday
alireza
miryousefi
spokesman
for
iran
s
mission
told
reuters
that
iran
has
not
requested
a
meeting
with
trump
some
iranian
insiders
have
said
any
talks
between
rouhani
and
trump
would
effectively
kill
the
existing
nuclear
accord
tensions
have
been
rising
after
a
deadly
attack
on
a
military
parade
in
southwestern
iran
in
which
people
were
killed
khamenei
said
on
monday
the
attackers
had
been
paid
by
ally
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
and
that
iran
would
severely
punish
those
behind
the
bloodshed
quashing
the
current
pact
would
come
at
a
political
cost
for
the
iranian
president
who
championed
the
deal
with
the
supreme
leader
s
guarded
backing
and
could
lose
support
from
european
allies
rouhani
is
also
under
increasing
pressure
from
iranian
hardliners
including
iran
s
elite
revolutionary
guards
which
have
kept
up
the
rhetoric
ahead
of
the
session
trump
s
administration
is
pushing
allies
to
cut
imports
of
iranian
oil
to
zero
as
washington
prepares
to
restore
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
sales
in
november
the
remaining
countries
in
the
deal
which
see
it
as
the
best
chance
to
stop
iran
from
developing
a
nuclear
bomb
on
monday
agreed
to
keep
working
to
maintain
trade
with
tehran
german
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
following
a
meeting
on
monday
with
britain
china
france
germany
russia
and
iran
in
new
york
warned
that
the
strategy
of
applying
maximum
pressure
on
tehran
and
going
it
alone
could
risk
a
regional
escalation
