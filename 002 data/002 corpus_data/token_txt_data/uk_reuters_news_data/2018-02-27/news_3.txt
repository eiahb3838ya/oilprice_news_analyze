reuters
world
stock
markets
broadly
fell
and
government
debt
yields
rose
on
tuesday
as
traders
perceived
tighter
monetary
policy
than
forecast
this
year
after
remarks
by
the
new
federal
reserve
chief
in
testimony
before
the
congress
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
pledged
to
balance
the
risk
of
an
overheating
economy
and
the
need
to
keep
growth
on
track
in
his
prepared
testimony
but
powell
s
remark
that
inflation
has
strengthened
since
december
sent
yields
higher
and
stocks
lower
the
yield
on
the
treasury
the
global
benchmark
for
commercial
lending
jumped
past
percent
and
equity
markets
in
europe
and
wall
street
turned
south
with
msci
s
key
index
of
global
equity
performance
falling
almost
percent
the

more
than
percent
the

added
to
gains
against
the
euro
the
yen
and
a
basket
of
major

fell
as
powell
s
comments
were
in
general
positive
for
the
greenback
said
brad
bechtel
managing
director
of
fx
at
jefferies
in
new
york
market
participants
in
general
said
powell
hewed
to
a
gradual
increase
in
rates
yet
some
saw
his
remarks
as
hawkish
it
seems
that
powell
s
personal
views
on
the
strength
of
the
economy
have
been
upgraded
since
december
said
jason
ware
chief
investment
officer
at
albion
financial
in
salt
lake
city
so
the
market
is
keying
off
this
idea
of
thinking
maybe
it
won
t
be
three
rate
hikes
but
maybe
four
ware
said
referring
to
the
fed
s
forecast
for
peter
cardillo
chief
market
economist
at
first
standard
financial
in
new

noted
that
the
moment
powell
indicated
there
would
probably
be
more
than
three
rate
hikes
this
year
treasuries
rose
the
dollar
ticked
up
while
stocks
went
down
if
we
see
the
approach
percent
we
d
probably
be
on
one
more
downward
leg
that
could
take
the
indices
to
levels
we
saw
a
few
weeks
ago
he
said
a
very
trying
period
for
the
market
could
be
ahead
