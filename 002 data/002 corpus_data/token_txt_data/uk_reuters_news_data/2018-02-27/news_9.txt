update 6-white house pushes for more talks after 'no deal' on biofuels
reuters
president
donald
trump
has
asked
for
more
talks
between
representatives
of
the
oil
and
corn
industries
after
a
meeting
on
tuesday
failed
to
yield
an
agreement
on
how
to
help
refiners
cope
with
the
country
s
biofuels
policy
trump
has
called
the
talks
between
big
corn
and
big
oil
amid
rising
concern
in
the
white
house
over
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
a
law
requiring
refiners
to
mix
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
into
their
fuel
the
policy
was
intended
to
help
farmers
and
reduce
petroleum
imports
but
has
increasingly
divided
farmers
and
energy
companies
two
of
trump
s
most
important
constituencies
a
refining
company
in
the
key
electoral
state
of
pennsylvania
last
month
blamed
the
rfs
for
its
bankruptcy
the
meeting
on
tuesday
included
republican
senators
ted
cruz
of
texas
and
pat
toomey
of
pennsylvania
both
from
major
oil
refining
states
along
with
charles
grassley
and
joni
ernst
of
major
corn
grower
state
iowa
no
deal
made
said
grassley
in
a
twitter
post
after
the
meeting
adding
the
proposals
discussed
were
not
win
win
and
would
destroy
ethanol
cruz
issued
a
statement
saying
the
meeting
was
positive
and
productive
and
added
that
trump
had
requested
another
session
this
week
after
that
meeting
i
believe
we
are
likely
to
arrive
upon
a
solution
cruz
said
white
house
spokeswoman
sarah
sanders
confirmed
the
tuesday
meeting
on
biofuels
and
said
we
re
going
to
continue
having
under
the
rfs
refiners
must
cover
the
costs
of
blending
increasing
volumes
of
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
gasoline
and
diesel
each
year
to
prove
compliance
with
the
program
they
have
to
acquire
credits
called
rins
either
by
earning
them
through
blending
or
by
buying
them
as
biofuels
volume
quotas
have
increased
over
the
years
so
have
prices
for
the
credits
that
has
been
good
news
for
companies
that
blend
the
fuels
but
refiners
that
do
not
have
blending
facilities
are
facing
rising
costs

which
employs
more
than
people
in
the
philadelphia
area
filed
for
bankruptcy
protection
last
month
and
blamed
the
regulation
for
its
demise
reuters
reported
that
other
factors
may
also
have
played
a
role
in
the
bankruptcy
including
the
withdrawal
of
more
than
million
in
payments
from
the
company
by
its
investor
owners
sources
told
reuters
the
pes
would
have
a
representative
at
the
next
white
house
meeting
likely
on
thursday
ernst
and
grassley
have
both
said
they
disagree
with
critics
who
say
rins
are
harmful
to
refiners
underscoring
the
fact
that
the
two
sides
can
not
even
agree
on
the
facts
let
alone
the
solutions
they
point
out
other
refiners
such
as
valero
energy
corp
and
marathon
petroleum
corp
are
pulling
in
solid
profits
despite
the
biofuels
regulation
america
s
biggest
ethanol
producers
include
archer
daniels
midland
co
and
poet
llc
at
least
four
options
aimed
at
reducing
the
cost
of
rins
were
up
for
consideration
two
sources
familiar
with
the
agenda
of
the
white
house
meeting
said
one
was
to
count
ethanol
exports
toward
annual
biofuels
volume
mandates
something
not
currently
permitted
under
the
policy
another
was
to
place
a
hard
cap
on
the
price
of
a
rin
and
a
third
was
to
limit
rin
trades
to
blenders
and
refiners
essentially
to
remove
market
speculation
the
sources
said
to
sweeten
the
deal
for
the
corn
industry
any
deal
would
have
likely
included
a
waiver
to
allow
gasoline
containing
percent
ethanol
to
be
sold
year
round
sales
of
blends
are
currently
restricted
during
the
summer
due
to
concerns
over
smog
discussions
could
also
look
at
solutions
focused
more
directly
on
refiner
pes
like
waiving
its
current
rin
obligation
valued
at
about
million
the
sources
said
but
such
a
move
would
likely
draw
a
backlash
from
other
refiners
who
have
no
hope
of
receiving
such
a
waiver
while
the
white
house
meetings
have
focused
on
fixes
that
could
be
implemented
with
executive
or
regulatory
action
there
is
a
separate
legislative
effort
to
alter
the
rfs
led
by
republican
senator
john
cornyn
of
texas
but
it
too
faces
stiff
resistance
from
corn
states
