feb
reuters
president
donald
trump
will
meet
with
senators
and
cabinet
officials
on
tuesday
to
discuss
ways
to
lower
the
cost
of
the
nation
s
biofuels
policy
to
oil
refiners
according
to
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
the
meeting
reflects
rising
concern
in
the
white
house
over
the
current
state
of
the
renewable
fuel
standard
a
law
requiring
refiners
to
mix
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
into
their
fuel
after
a
pennsylvania
refiner
blamed
the
regulation
for
its
recent
bankruptcy
the
meeting
will
include
republican
senators
ted
cruz
of
texas
pat
toomey
of
pennsylvania
chuck
grassley
and
joni
ernst
of
corn
state
iowa
along
with
environmental
protection
agency
administrator
scott
pruitt
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
and
energy
secretary
rick
perry
according
to
the
sources
the
meeting
will
also
include
white
house
legislative
director
marc
short
who
will
seek
to
ensure
any
agreement
can
be
achieved
through
executive
orders
and
regulatory
actions
defensible
in
court
the
sources
said
representatives
for
those
officials
and
the
white
house
declined
to
comment
farm
groups
urged
trump
in
a
letter
on
monday
not
to
weaken
the
rfs
calling
it
a
critical
engine
of
rural
jobs
any
action
that
seeks
to
weaken
the
rfs
for
the
benefit
of
a
handful
of
refiners
will
by
extension
be
borne
on
the
backs
of
our
farmers
according
to
the
letter
under
the
rfs
refiners
must
earn
or
purchase
biofuel
blending
credits
called
rins
to
prove
to
the
federal
government
that
enough
biofuels
are
being
blended
into
their
gasoline
and
diesel
to
comply
with
the
policy
as
biofuels
volumes
quotas
have
increased
over
the
years
however
so
have
prices
for
the
credits
meaning
refiners
that
buy
them
instead
of
acquire
them
by
blending
fuels
themselves
are
facing
rising
costs
oil
refiner
philadelphia
energy
solutions
pes
which
employs
more
than
people
in
a
key
electoral
state
declared
bankruptcy
last
month
and
blamed
the
regulation
for
its
demise
reuters
reported
other
factors
may
also
have
played
a
role
in
the
company
s
bankruptcy
including
the
withdrawal
of
more
than
million
in
payments
from
the
company
by
its
investor
owners
two
of
the
sources
familiar
with
the
agenda
of
the
tuesday
meeting
said
at
least
four
options
aimed
at
reducing
the
cost
of
rins
to
refiners
like
pes
will
be
considered
though
they
noted
the
effort
would
be
constrained
by
political
and
legal
realities
that
have
derailed
previous
reform
efforts
prices
of
rins
tumbled
by
nearly
percent
in
the
past
week
on
expectations
of
a
regulatory
tweak
one
idea
would
be
to
count
ethanol
exports
toward
annual
biofuels
volumes
mandates
that
are
currently
focused
purely
on
domestic
usage
an
idea
the
sources
said
had
been
studied
by
agriculture
secretary
perdue
who
now
favors
it
another
idea
would
be
to
place
a
cap
on
the
price
of
a
rin
senator
cruz
late
last
year
suggested
capping
rin
prices
at
cents
each
far
below
the
current
value
of
over
cents
in
a
move
that
was
roundly
rejected
by
biofuels
advocates
the
meeting
will
also
consider
measures
to
remove
speculation
from
the
rin
market
potentially
by
limiting
rin
transactions
to
those
directly
involved
in
generating
and
consuming
them
blenders
and
refiners
the
sources
said
any
plan
would
also
likely
include
a
concession
to
the
ethanol
industry
they
said
such
as
a
waiver
to
allow
gasoline
containing
percent
ethanol
to
be
sold
year
round
sales
of
blends
are
currently
restricted
in
the
summer
due
to
concerns
over
smog
the
meeting
could
also
look
at
solutions
focused
more
directly
on
refiner
pes
like
waiving
its
current
rin
obligation
valued
at
about
million
the
sources
said
but
any
such
move
would
likely
draw
a
backlash
from
other
refiners
who
have
no
hope
of
receiving
such
a
waiver
