from

driven
by

as
position
adjustments
ahead
of
powell
s
testimony
powell
s
debut
appearance
is
seen
as
critical
for
financial
markets
at
a
time
when
many
investors
are
nervous
about
the
fed
s
policy
normalisation
following
years
of
stimulus
after
the
financial
crisis
almost
a
decade
ago
many
investors
expect
the
fed
to
raise
interest
rates
three
times
this
year
with
some
pundits
predicting
four
if
inflation
starts
to
take
off
especially
as
growth
is
set
to
get
another
boost
from
the
trump
administration
s
tax
cuts
and
spending
plans
yet
there
are
worries
higher
dollar
bond
yields
could
prompt
investors
to
shift
funds
to
bonds
from
riskier
assets
especially
when
the
valuation
of
the
world
s
stocks
are
quite
expensive
even
after
their
earlier
this
month
the
treasuries
yield
xx
percent
well
above
dividend
yield
of
the
s
p
which
stood
at
percent
a
rise
in
dollar
interest
rates
could
also
bode
ill
for
potential
borrowers
including
home
buyers
and
many
companies
that
have
expanded
borrowing
for
years
to
take
advantage
of
low
dollar
funding
costs
expectations
that
powell
will
be
sensitive
to
financial
markets
appear
to
be
running
high
but
he
hasn
t
said
he
will
sacrifice
policy
normalisation
for
the
sake
of
financial
markets

feel
there
is
room
for
disappointment
in
markets
