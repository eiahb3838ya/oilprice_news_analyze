the
united
states
will
overtake
russia
as
the
world
s
biggest
oil
producer
by
at
the
latest
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
on
tuesday
as
the
country
s
shale
oil
boom
continues
to
upend
global
markets
iea
executive
director
fatih
birol
said
at
an
event
in
tokyo
the
united
states
would
overtake
russia
as
the
biggest
crude
oil
producer
definitely
next
year
if
not
this
year
shale
growth
is
very
strong
the
pace
is
very
strong
the
united
states
will
become
the
oil
producer
sometime
very
soon
he
told
reuters
separately
crude
oil
output
rose
above
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
late
last
year
for
the
first
time
since
the
overtaking
top
oil
exporter
saudi
arabia
the
energy
information
administration
said
early
this
month
that
output
would
exceed
million
bpd
by
late
that
would
take
it
past
top
producer
russia
which
pumps
just
below
that
mark
birol
said
he
did
not
see
oil
production
peaking
before
and
that
he
did
not
expect
a
decline
in
the
next
four
to
five
years
the
soaring
production
is
upending
global
oil
markets
coming
at
a
time
when
other
major
producers
including
russia
and
members
of
the
middle
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
have
been
withholding
output
to
prop
up
prices
oil
is
also
increasingly
being
exported
including
to
the
world
s
biggest
and
fastest
growing
markets
in
asia
eating
away
at
opec
and
russian
market
share
meanwhile
net
imports
of
crude
oil
fell
last
week
by
million
bpd
to
million
bpd
the
lowest
level
since
the
eia
started
recording
the
data
in
reflecting
further
erosion
in
a
market
opec
has
been
relying
on
for
decades
birol
said
production
growth
was
not
just
strong
in
the
united
states
canada
especially
the
oil
sands
and
brazilian
offshore
projects
these
are
the
two
major
drivers
he
said
on
the
demand
side
