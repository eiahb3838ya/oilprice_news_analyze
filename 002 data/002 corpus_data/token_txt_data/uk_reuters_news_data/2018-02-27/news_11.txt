gabon
accused
french
environmental
services
group
veolia
on
tuesday
of
widespread
pollution
at
seeg
the
power
and
water
utility
it
operates
there
amid
a
growing
dispute
over
the
company
s
concession
veolia
which
has
already
threatened
legal
action
after
the
government
seized
seeg
earlier
this
month
and
said
it
would
cancel
its
concession
rejected
the
accusations
speaking
to
reporters
in
the
capital
libreville
government
spokesman
bilie
by
nze
said
an
environmental
inspection
of
power
and
water
pumping
stations
discovered
nearly
all
seeg
sites
were
contaminated
by
petroleum
waste
this
is
a
very
serious
situation
since
at
this
stage
aside
from
the
obvious
environmental
damage
no
one
knows
the
consequences
this
pollution
could
have
had
or
could
have
on
public
health
he
said
he
said
that
on
top
of
legal
penalties
of
up
to
million
cfa
francs
for
each
polluted
site
gabon
would
force
seeg
to
shoulder
the
costs
responding
to
the
accusations
veolia
stated
that
the
water
it
distributed
continued
to
conform
to
world
health
organization
standards
and
gabonese
regulations
it
is
surprising
that
none
of
the
inspections
of
the
public
authorities
ever
highlighted
environmental
damage
it
said
the
seeg
is
subject
to
regular
audits
by
the
gabonese
authorities
more
than
in
the
last
negotiations
between
the
government
and
veolia
over
the
concession
broke
down
in
october
and
authorities
seized
seeg
earlier
this
month
citing
years
of
poor
service
quality
veolia
in
turn
blamed
the
government
for
failing
to
live
up
to
its
investment
obligations
and
on
tuesday
said
the
state
owed
seeg
over
billion
cfa
francs
in
consumption
charges
and
unpaid
tax
reimbursements
gabon
spokesman
bilie
by
nze
said
the
government
had
called
for
an
audit
of
its
billion
cfa
consumption
bill
he
rejected
accusations
it
had
neglected
seeg
and
said
the
state
had
invested
around
trillion
cfa
francs
in
the
company
around
three
times
more
than
veolia
cfa
francs
