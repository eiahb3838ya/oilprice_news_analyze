germany
s
basf
said
it
was
aiming
for
a
gain
of
up
to
percent
in
group
operating
profit
this
year
as
it
bets
on
a
rebound
in
specialty
chemicals
to
offset
an
expected
weaker
performance
in
basic
petrochemicals
the
chemicals
maker
is
coming
off
a
strong
year
where
supply
bottlenecks
and
strong
demand
across
the
petrochemicals
industry
boosted
earnings
its
basic
chemicals
unit
saw
earnings
before
interest
and
tax
ebit
adjusted
for
items
surge
by
percent
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
company
said
on
tuesday
however
it
expects
adjusted
ebit
at
the
unit
to
drop
by
percent
or
more
in
it
said
that
forecast
combined
with
a
proposed
annual
dividend
of
euros
per
share
which
fell
short
of
expectations
saw
basf
shares
fall
percent
to
euros
as
of
gmt
making
them
the
performer
on
germany
dax
index
basf
which
last
month
reported
a
operating
profit
up
percent
issued
divisional
results
on
tuesday
which
showed
that
specialty
products
something
the
company
is
looking
to
for
growth
underperformed
morgan
stanley
analysts
said
its
performance
in
specialty
products
was
a
little
disappointing
helping
however
were
profit
margins
at
its
commodity
chemicals
unit
which
rose
to
close
to
percent
of
sales
in
almost
double
their
average
over
the
previous
five
years
mirroring
similar
developments
at
rivals
such
as
covestro
basf
and
its
rivals
are
ramping
up
output
capacity
most
notably
for
chemicals
used
in
building
insulation
or
furniture
which
will
likely
ease
supply
shortages
basf
also
aims
to
overcome
the
weakness
at
its
advanced
and
customised
products
such
as
food
nutrients
ingredients
for
household
products
or
engineering
plastics
the
downstream
segments
in
clearly
need
to
improve
their
performance

basf
also
said
its
wintershall
oil
and
gas
division
which
it
is
seeking
to
merge
with
russian
billionaire
mikhail
fridman
s
dea
should
help
raise
profits
this
year

strong
