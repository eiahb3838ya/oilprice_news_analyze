berlin
feb
reuters
a
top
german
court
ruled
on
tuesday
in
favour
of
allowing
major
cities
to
ban
heavily
polluting
diesel
cars
a
move
likely
to
hit
the
value
of
million
vehicles
in
europe
s
largest
car
market
and
force
carmakers
to
pay
for
costly
modifications
analysts
have
said
the
ruling
of
the
leipzig
court
will
be
crucial
in
shaping
demand
across
europe
where
sales
have
been
declining
for
months
on
the
back
of
a
regulatory
backlash
and
amid
signs
of
widespread
rigging
of
emission
tests
among
carmakers
germany
s
duh
environmental
lobby
sued
the
regional
capitals
of
stuttgart
and
duesseldorf
to
force
them
to
comply
with
european
union
air
pollution
limits
they
have
violated
for
years
the
two
associated
german
states
appealed
against
the
rulings
leaving
the
federal
administrative
court
in
leipzig
to
decide
whether
city
bans
for
diesel
cars
are
legal
emissions
cause
respiratory
problems
and
have
been
linked
to
premature
deaths
any
driving
bans
would
probably
affect
vehicles
equipped
with
technology
and
older
models
of
the
million
diesel
cars
on
germany
s
roads
last
year
about
million
were
fitted
with
the
latest
standard
which
has
applied
to
all
new
cars
sold
since
september
according
to
the
kba
motor
vehicle
watchdog
affected
cities
would
need
at
least
six
months
to
redraw
their
strategies
before
any
bans
could
take
effect
legal
experts
have
said
germany
s
adac
motorist
club
does
not
even
expect
bans
to
be
launched
before
the
end
of
the
year
prior
to
any
implementation
german
lawmakers
will
likely
be
asked
to
overhaul
nationwide
road
traffic
regulations
any
restriction
will
likely
accelerate
the
drop
in
demand
from
consumers
already
worried
about
resale
values
and
possible
recalls
carmakers
have
been
adapting
their
model
lineups
to
make
up
for
consumers
sudden
shift
to
gasoline
vehicles
traffic
bans
in
europe
s
biggest
auto
market
would
likely
influence
policies
across
the
region
