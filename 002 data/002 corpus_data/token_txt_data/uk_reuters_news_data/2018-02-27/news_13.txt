oklahoma regulator issues new regional protocol to curb earthquakes
houston
reuters
oklahoma
s
oil
and
gas
regulator
on
tuesday
released
new
requirements
aimed
at
reducing
the
risk
of
earthquakes
from
hydraulic
fracturing
in
shale
regions
in
central
and
southern
areas
of
the
state
the
new
protocol
issued
by
the
oklahoma
corporation
commission
occ
comes
in
addition
to
existing
rules
that
apply
to
a
square
mile
area
targeted
by
the
regulator
for
its
high
rate
of
temblors
from
wastewater
injection
the
new
requirements
are
aimed
at
completion
activities
in
the
scoop
and
stack
shale
producing
areas
where
drilling
is
picking
up
as
oil
prices
have
climbed
above
a
barrel
this
year
the
state
in
recent
years
saw
a
surge
in
earthquakes
due
to
the
injection
of
saltwater
produced
from
oil
and
gas
drilling
activities
into
disposal
wells
in
there
were
magnitude
or
higher
earthquakes
versus
just
temblors
of
that
intensity
five
years
earlier
according
to
oklahoma
geological
survey
data
under
the
new
rules
operators
will
be
required
to
have
access
to
a
seismic
array
that
gives
information
on
earthquakes
the
rules
also
lower
the
threshold
for
which
an
operator
must
take
action
to
a
magnitude
quake
from
and
require
some
operators
to
pause
operations
for
six
hours
in
the
event
of
a
magnitude
quake
previously
operators
were
only
required
to
pause
operations
for
a
magnitude
or
higher
quake
there
have
been
earthquakes
of
magnitude
or
greater
in
the
scoop
and
stack
area
of
oklahoma
since
december
matt
skinner
public
information
manager
for
the
oklahoma
corporation
commission
said
on
tuesday
ultimately
the
goal
is
to
have
enough
information
to
develop
plans
that
will
virtually
eliminate
the
risk
of
a
felt
earthquake
from
a
well
completion
operation
in
the
scoop
and
stack
said
jeremy
boak
director
of
the
oklahoma
geological
survey
in
a
release
earthquakes
that
fall
below
magnitude
are
usually
not
felt
but
can
be
measured
on
seismographs
well
completion
activities
are
less
likely
to
produce
induced
earthquakes
than
wastewater
injection
geologists
said
in
a
release
issued
by
the
occ
on
tuesday
the
scoop
and
stack
have
far
less
water
associated
with
drilling
activities
than
oklahoma
s
arbuckle
formation
which
was
linked
to
a
high
rate
of
temblors
from
wastewater
injection
they
added
the
jump
in
earthquakes
has
drawn
increased
attention
in
recent
years
particularly
after
some
larger
quakes
have
occurred
near
the
massive
oil
storage
hub
of
cushing
