indonesian
finance
minister
sri
mulyani
indrawati
said
on
tuesday
she
expected
the
nominee
for
the
next
central
bank
governor
to
continue
to
focus
on
stability
and
taming
inflation
while
adopting
a
pragmatic
approach
to
boosting
growth
president
joko
widodo
s
selection
of
perry
warjiyo
a
longtime
deputy
governor
of
bank
indonesia
to
succeed
agus
martowardojo
was
confirmed
on
saturday
in
her
first
comments
on
the
nomination
indrawati
said
in
an
interview
that
she
hoped
warjiyo
would
maintain
the
bank
s
strong
reputation
for
policy
credibility
built
up
under
his
boss
and
predecessor
we
of
course
expect
because
bank
indonesia
is
the
central
bank
they
are
going
to
continue
maintaining
stability
but
at
the
same
time
they
are
going
to
be
pragmatic
enough
to
see
the
opportunity
for
them
to
continue
to
support
what
the
government
is
actually
addressing
poverty
inequality
and
growth
she
said
i
think
the
most
important
is
job
creation
and
the
comments
come
as
the
government
is
redoubles
efforts
to
boost
growth
which
has
struggled
to
exceed
percent
in
recent
years
well
below
the
percent
widodo
pledged
to
deliver
while
campaigning
in
a
collapse
in
commodities
prices
just
as
he
took
office
is
partly
to
blame
indrawati
also
emphasized
the
independence
of
its
central
bank
was
one
of
the
key
structural
changes
that
helped
indonesia
recover
from
a
painful
recession
after
the
financial
crisis
forced
it
to
turn
to
the
international
monetary
fund
for
a
bailout
indrawati
said
that
warjiyo
s
experience
at
bank
indonesia
and
previously
at
the
imf
would
prepare
him
well
for
the
role
she
added
that
she
had
a
good
relationship
with
warjiyo
whom
she
described
as
a
likeable
person
who
tells
a
lot
of
as
a
deputy
governor
warjiyo
s
role
includes
monetary
policy
mix
formulation
financial
market
deepening
and
islamic
financial
market
development
indrawati
also
said
it
was
important
for
indonesia
to
boost
consumption
growth
back
towards
the
percent
level
seen
before
the
financial
crisis
it
has
been
stuck
around
percent
in
recent
years
the
government
has
been
increasing
cash
transfers
to
help
its
poorest
keep
pace
with
inflation
but
she
said
it
has
yet
to
understand
why
construction
wages
have
stagnated
despite
increased
infrastructure
spending
and
how
to
capture
the
growth
of
digital
trade
in
its
consumption
statistics
another
way
to
boost
growth
is
through
increased
business
investment
and
indrawati
said
the
government
was
considering
adding
new
tax
allowances
for
investment
in
sectors
such
as
petrochemicals
pharmaceuticals
manufacturing
and
downstream
processing
for
agribusiness
and
mining
commodities
these
are
among
previously
unnamed
sectors
that
she
said
last
week
would
be
considered
for
new
eligibility
for
revised
tax
incentives
these
are
all
the
areas
which
i
think
have
huge
correlation
with
domestic
demand
which
is
growing
very
fast
she
said
the
government
also
will
begin
a
benchmarking
approach
of
studying
neighboring
countries
tax
incentives
including
those
offered
by
thailand
to
see
if
they
should
be
matched
she
said
turning
to
president
donald
trump
s
trade
policies
indrawati
said
tariff
actions
that
spark
deeper
trade
disputes
could
put
global
growth
at
risk
this
in
turn
could
cut
demand
abroad
for
the
same
exports
that
trump
wants
to
boost
indonesia
had
a
trade
surplus
with
the
united
states
largely
on
apparel
textiles
seafood
and
palm
oil
its
biggest
imports
are
soybeans
aircraft
and
cotton
if
the
united
states
as
the
largest
economy
in
the
world
creates
a
weakening
global
economy
even
a
recession
it
will
backfire
to
the
united
states
own
interests
she
said
you
can
t
say
my
country
first
and
the
rest
is
not
indrawati
said
the
fair
and
reciprocal
trading
system
that
trump
has
insisted
on
would
be
best
ensured
by
settling
disputes
through
established
bodies
such
as
the
world
trade
organization
trump
frequently
complains
about
the
wto
calling
it
a
catastrophe
on
monday
he
is
considering
several
unilateral
tariff
actions
that
almost
certainly
will
draw
challenges
under
wto
rules
including
steel
and
aluminum
tariffs
on
national
security
grounds
and
potential
trade
sanctions
against
china
over
its
intellectual
property
practices
