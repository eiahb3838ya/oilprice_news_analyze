told
reuters
on
tuesday
many
latin
american
countries
are
trying
to
improve
their
offerings
and
contract
rules
to
secure
foreign
investment
amid
intense
regional
competitions
this
year
with
major
auctions
expected
in
mexico
brazil
and
uruguay
the
minister
said
the
amistad
gas
field
in
the
guayaquil
gulf
will
be
added
to
the
ecuadorian
auction
along
with
at
least
four
mature
or
small
onshore
oil
blocks
that
will
be
developed
under
service
contracts
with
oil
company
petroamazonas
our
goal
is
to
attract
investment
and
also
look
for
an
increase
in
production
and
reserves
in
the
future
perez
told
reuters
in
an
interview
before
a
public
event
to
review
the
country
s
main
oil
achievements
last
year
amistad
is
the
country
s
only
gas
producing
field
with
an
output
of
million
cubic
feet
per
day
from
six
active
wells
according
to
official
figures
the
government
has
not
yet
decided
the
contract
model
for
that
area
as
new
legislation
for
the
gas
industry
is
needed
perez
said
the
mature
onshore
oilfields
include
the
cuyabeno
oso
and
areas
at
ecuador
s
amazon
region
perez
said
those
will
be
added
to
eight
onshore
areas
in
the
country
s
northeast
close
to
the
border
with
colombia
under
the
intracampos
bidding
round
whose
results
are
expected
in
august
ecuador
which
is
opening
to
international
markets
tackling
tax
reform
and
austerity
measures
under
the
government
of
president
lenin
moreno
has
said
it
plans
to
increase
crude
production
by
barrels
per
day
bpd
this
year
by
adding
barrels
from
its
itt
block
it
is
switching
to
shared
profit
agreements
from
service
contracts
in
the
areas
not
operated
by
petroamazonas
to
secure
more
investments
the
new
terms
will
allow
producers
to
be
paid
in
oil
and
enable
them
to
export
or
sell
the
barrels
to
local
refineries
the
andean
country
s
crude
output
has
fallen
to
bpd
perez
said
below
the
output
ceiling
of
bpd
when
opec
agreed
to
restrain
production
starting
last
year
perez
recently
started
talks
with
opec
to
be
allowed
to
increase
ecuador
s
production
this
year
despite
the
organization
s
joint
output
cut
agreement
that
is
slated
to
run
through
the
end
of
this
year
he
added
ecuador
s
production
is
marginal
in
the
opec
context
it
is
a
commitment
with
them
to
maintain
opec
s
unity
we
talked
about
it
during
the
opec
secretary
general
s
visit
earlier
this
month
they
are
giving
ecuador
flexibility
