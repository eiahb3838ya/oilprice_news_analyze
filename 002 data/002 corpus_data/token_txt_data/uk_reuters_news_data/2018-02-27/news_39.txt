driven

as
position
adjustments
ahead
of
powell
s
testimony
powell
s
debut
appearance
is
seen
as
critical
for
financial
markets
at
a
time
when
many
investors
are
nervous
about
the
fed
s
policy
normalisation
following
years
of
stimulus
in
the
wake
of
the
financial
crisis
almost
a
decade
ago
many
investors
expect
the
fed
to
raise
interest
rates
three
times
this
year
with
some
pundits
predicting
four
if
inflation
starts
to
take
off
especially
as
growth
is
set
to
get
another
boost
from
the
trump
administration
s
tax
cuts
and
spending
plans
yet
there
are
worries
that
higher
dollar
bond
yields
could
prompt
investors
to
shift
funds
to
bonds
from
riskier
assets
especially
when
the
valuation
of
the
world
s
stocks
are
quite
expensive
even
after
their
earlier
this
month
the
treasuries
yield
was
percent
well
above
the
dividend
yield
of
the
s
p
which
stood
at
percent
the
consensus
view
in
the
market
is
that
powell
will
continue
with
a
gradualist
stance
and
deliver
an
upbeat
view
of
us
economic
prospects
said
neil
mackinnon
economist
at
vtb
capital
research
the
markets
are
already
pricing
in
three
basis
points
rate
hikes
with
the
first
hike
expected
to
be
announced
at
the
march
fomc
meeting
investors
are
alert
to
the
possibility
of
a
fourth
hike
this
year
though
if
powell
emphasises
the
likelihood
of
this
then
markets
might
react
fed
funds
rate
futures
were
almost
fully
pricing
in
a
rate
hike
at
the
fed
s
next
policy
meeting
on
march
any
talk
of
overheating
or
risks
of
an
inflation
overshoot
could
result
in
the
money
markets
revising
up
estimates
of
where
the
terminal
fed
funds
rate
might
end
up
in
this
cycle
mackinnon
said
a
rise
in
dollar
interest
rates
could
also
bode
ill
for
potential
borrowers
including
home
buyers
and
many
companies
that
have
expanded
borrowing
for
years
to
take
advantage
of
low
dollar
funding
costs
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
traded
percent
higher
elsewhere
in
currencies
the
euro
was
flat
at
off
its
high
of
hit
earlier
this
month
oil
edged
lower
ahead
of
weekly
data
that
is
forecast
to
show
a
rise
in
crude
inventories
although
investor
faith
in
opec

ability
to
curtail
production
helped
stem
