yields
rose
on
tuesday
as
traders
perceived

tightening
of

than
forecast
after
remarks
by
the
new
federal
reserve
chief
in
testimony
before
the
congress

jerome
powell
pledged
to
balance
the
risk
of
an

the
need
to
keep
growth
on
track
in

that

market
participants
in
general
said
powell
hewed
to
a
gradual
increase
in
rates
yet
some
saw
his
remarks
as
hawkish
it
seems
that
powell
s
personal
views
on
the
strength
of
the
economy
have
been
upgraded
since
december
said
jason
ware
chief
investment
officer
at

financial

so
the

is
keying
off
this
idea
of

it
won
t
be
three
rate
hikes
but
maybe
four

his
impression
the
economy
was
getting

was
going
to
raise
his
personal
forecast
for
four
rate
