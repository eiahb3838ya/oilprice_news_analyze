the

we

opec
led
by
saudi

and
russia
have
reduced
production
during
to
prop
up

prices
the
united
states
which
rivals
russia
and
saudi
arabia
for
the
position
of
the
world
s
largest
oil
producer
is
not
participating
in
cuts
as
its
industry
is
represented
by
private
producers
who
can
be
sued
for
collusion
if
they
join
the
deal
the
opec
cut
has
boosted
prices
which
topped
a
barrel

the
rally
is
spurring
renewed
growth

global
markets
opec
officials
say
they
are
not
worried
about
a
renewed
surge
in
shale
swamping
its
efforts
this
year
but
have
urged
shale
producers
to
help
curtail
global
supply
it
s
normal
for
shale
oil
tight
oil
to
increase
in
and
whenever
oil
prices
support

said
iraq
s
national
representative
to
opec
ali
nazar
at
an
event
in
berlin
on
tuesday
but
we
all
should
look
with
responsibility
to
the
market
in
order
to
keep
the
balance
in
the
market
as
much
as
we
can
so
as
not
to
harm
