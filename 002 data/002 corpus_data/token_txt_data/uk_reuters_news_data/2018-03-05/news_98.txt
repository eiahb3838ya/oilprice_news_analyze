three

william

provincial
administrator
of
hela
province
by
telephone
from
tari
about
km
from
where
the
shocks
hit
what
we
experienced
this
morning
could
have
caused
more
damage
but
we
don
t
know
it
almost
threw
me
out
of
the

moresby
could
not
immediately
be
reached
by

the
strong
tremors
hit
a
region
already
badly
damaged
by
the
magnitude
quake
that
struck
on
the
largest
to
hit
the
highlands
in
nearly
a
century
triggering
landslides
flattening
buildings
and
closing
oil
and
gas
operations
while
the
region
has
no
major
urban
centres
around
people
live
within
km
miles
of
the
epicentre
according
to
the
red
cross
at
least
people
were
killed
when
hamlets
nearest
the
epicentre
were
buried
most
of
the
other
casualties
were
in
the
provincial
capital

and
the

officials
told

the
quake
has
been
felt
on

aid

have
said
nearly
people
remain
in
urgent
need
of
emergency
supplies
australia
new
zealand
and
the
red
cross
have
all
pledged
aid
though
reaching
the
remote
area
has
proven
challenging
as
forbidding
terrain
bad
weather
as
well
as
damaged
roads
and
runways
have
delayed
aid
efforts
the
rugged
terrain
and
loss
of
communications
in
the
area
impacted
means
it
is
taking
time
to
build
a
complete
picture
of
the
damage
but
we
know
that
tens
of
thousands
of
people
are
reported
