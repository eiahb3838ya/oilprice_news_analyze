any
deal
between
the
philippines
and
a
chinese
firm
to
jointly
explore
for
gas
in
the
reed
bank
of
the
south
china
sea
will
be
illegal
unless
china
recognises
the
southeast
asian
nation
s
sovereign
rights
there
a
philippine
judge
said
on
monday
manila
has
identified
two
areas
in
the
crowded
waterway
suitable
for
joint
exploration
and
the
two
countries
seek
a
way
to
tackle
the
diplomatic
and
legal
headache
of
jointly
exploring
in
the
waters
but
without
addressing
the
issue
of
sovereignty
the
reed
bank
is
claimed
by
both
sides
but
international
law
says
it
falls
within
the
exclusive
economic
zone
eez
of
the
philippines
china
says
it
falls
within
the
line
on
maps
recording
its
historic
rights
in
the
area
antonio
carpio
the
acting
top
judge
of
the
supreme
court
said
it
was
legal
for
the
philippines
energy
ministry
to
talk
to
china
national
offshore
oil
corp
cnooc
as
a
possible
there
s
no
problem
as
long
as
cnooc
will
recognize
that
that
is
our
exclusive
economic
zone
he
told
news
channel
anc
in
an
interview
but
that
is
the
problem
because
cnooc
will
not
recognise
philippine
jurisdiction
carpio
was
speaking
as
an
expert
on
international
law
and
staunch
advocate
for
the
philippines
to
assert
its
maritime
sovereignty
claims
he
was
among
the
lawyers
involved
in
the
philippines
legal
challenge
against
china
which
manila
brought
to
the
permanent
court
of
arbitration
in
the
hague
in
the
tribunal
in
its
ruling
invalidated
china
s
line
making
clear
that
the
reed
bank
fell
within
the
philippines
eez
and
that
manila
had
sovereign
rights
to
resources
there
china
is
a
signatory
to
the
united
nations
convention
on
the
law
of
the
sea
unclos
but
it
does
not
recognise
the
hague
court
ruling
the
stumbling
block
has
always
been
the
insistence
of
china
that
we
recognise
their
sovereign
rights
carpio
said
we
can
not
do
that
anymore
because
there
s
already
a
ruling
and
the
philippine
constitution
says
the
state
shall
protect
its
marine
wealth
in
its
exclusive
economic
zone
it
s
very
the
reed
bank
was
the
site
of
exploration
by
the
philippines
pxp
energy
corp
to
evaluate
the
block
s
gas
reserves
until
the
energy
ministry
suspended
activities
there
in
late
because
of
the
arbitration
case
pxp
has
had
talks
with
cnooc
for
possible
joint
exploration
and
development
but
the
arbitration
halted
negotiations
carpio
said
who
should
collect
taxes
was
also
an
issue
between
the
two
companies
last
week
philippine
presidential
spokesman
harry
roque
said
any
potential
deals
between
manila
and
beijing
should
be
agreed
with
a
company
and
not
the
chinese
government
on
monday
he
said
the
philippines
and
china
would
have
to
sign
a
treaty
to
enter
into
joint
exploration
and
development
in
the
reed
bank
that
s
on
the
assumption
that
the
reed
bank
is
contested
territory
he
told
reporters
we
have
no
treaty
on
joint
exploration
