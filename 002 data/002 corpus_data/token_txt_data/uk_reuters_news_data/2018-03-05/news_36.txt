two
of
libya
s
largest
oilfields
with
combined
production
of
nearly
barrels
per
day
bpd
have
suffered
shutdowns
in
quick
succession
casting
fresh
doubt
on
a
partial
recovery
in
the
opec
member
s
oil
output
libya
s
national
output
has
been
sustained
at
about
one
million
bpd
for
months
and
most
recent
closures
have
been
quickly
resolved
a
shutdown
that
began
on
sunday
at
el
sharara
libya
s
biggest
field

continuing
risks
to
output
in
a
country
without
centralized
security
forces
or
political
control
libya
has
the
largest
proven
reserves
of
oil
in
africa
and
has
been
a
key
supplier
of
light
sweet
crude
to
europe
around
it
produced
more
than
million
bpd
and
before
the
uprising
in
which
muammar
gaddafi
was
toppled
and
killed
seven
years
ago
it
was
pumping
more
than
million
bpd
last
year
the
national
oil
corporation
noc
outlined
plans
that
would
raise
production
to
million
bpd
by
but
said
this
would
need
around
billion
of
investment
foreign
oil
companies
including
italy
s
eni
total
of
france
and
firms
conocophillips
and
hess
have
production
stakes
through
joint
ventures
with
the
noc
since
libya
s
uprising
power
in
the
sparsely
populated
nation
has
fragmented
and
local
groups
have
used
oil
facilities
as
bargaining
chips
to
press
financial
and
political
demands
armed
factions
across
the
country
have
cut
off
production
at
key
fields
and
ports
including
a
long
blockade
of
terminals
in
libya
s
eastern
oil
crescent
from
prolonged
and
haphazard
shutdowns
have
reduced
pressure
at
oil
wells
as
libya
s
revenue
fell
due
to
production
disruptions
and
lower
oil
prices
demands
for
salaries
local
development
and
jobs
that
feed
into
blockades

more
widespread
islamic

of

at
two
of
libya
s
biggest
terminals
es
sider
and
ras
lanuf
has
yet
to
be
repaired
fields
including
mabruk
and
ghani
remain
closed
after
disputed
elections
in
led
to
rival
governments
being
set
up
in
tripoli
and
the
east
factions
tried
to
sell
oil
independently
they
failed
but
the
split
added
to
uncertainty
in
libya
s
oil
sector
the
causes
of
recent
shutdowns
include
economic
protests
by
guards
armed
groups
pushing
for
the
release
of
jailed
members
and
apparent
political
maneuvering
in
the
east
sometimes
shutdowns
are
triggered
in
remote
fields
or
at
terminals
sometimes
by
people
with
access
to
gearboxes
that
control
pipeline
valves
production
at
the
key
sharara
field
has
repeatedly
been
cut
on
the
long
pipeline
leading
to
the
coast
by
groups
near
zintan
a
western
town
that
became
militarily
powerful
in
the
uprising
the
internationally
recognized
government
of
national
accord
gna
in
tripoli
which
lacks
authority
over
armed
groups
even
in
the
capital
often
has
little
means
of
ending
blockades
oil
installations
are
meant
to
be
protected
by
the
petroleum
facilities
guards
pfg
but
as
with
other
parts
of
libya
s
security
forces
their
official
status
is
effectively
and
their
actions
are
governed
by
local
interests
rather
than
any
central
authority
even
as
longer
blockades
ended
from
financial
constraints
have
been
an
underlying
drag
on
libya
s
production
rebound
the
noc
has
had
rocky
relations
with
the
gna
and
has
complained
repeatedly
that
budget
allocations
have
been
held
up
the
gna
says
its
own
resources
are
limited
a
bigger
political
risk
also
looms
factions
in
the
east
where
most
of
libya
s
oil
wealth
is
located
are
opposed
to
the
gna
and
say
it
has
not
disbursed
sufficient
oil
income
to
eastern
regions
some
eastern
hardliners
have
threatened
to
cut
oil
production
although
for
now
the
libyan
national
army
lna
which
has
good
relations
with
the
noc
in
tripoli
has
kept
fields
and
ports
open
security
is
still
volatile
in
december
an
explosion
at
a
pipeline
in
eastern
libya
caused
an
outage
of
up
to
bpd
though
it
was
quickly
repaired
international
companies
are
working
offshore
but
still
have
a
limited
presence
onshore
keeping
exploration
and
development
programs
mostly
on
hold
along
with
nigeria
libya
has
been
exempted
from
production
cuts
that
seek
to
bolster
crude
prices
and
have
been
extended
until
the
end
of
despite
speculation
that
the
two
troubled
nations
would
be
pressured
into
joining
the
deal
both
have
signaled
their
intention
to
raise
production
