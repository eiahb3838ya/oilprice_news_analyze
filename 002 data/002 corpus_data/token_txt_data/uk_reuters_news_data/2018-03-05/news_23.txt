france
s
foreign
minister
visited
iran
on
monday
on
a
delicate
mission
to
reaffirm
europe
s
support
for
a
nuclear
deal
that
opened
iran
s
economy
while
echoing
concern
about
tehran
s
missile
programme
and
role
in
regional
conflicts
le
drian
s
visit
reflected
french
efforts
to
safeguard
iran
s
accord
with
major
powers
president
donald
trump
has
threatened
to
pull
out
unless
three
european
signatories
help
fix
the
deal
by
forcing
iran
to
limit
its
sway
in
the
middle
east
and
rein
in
its
missile
programme
iran
s
clerical
rulers
believe
that
even
if
it
were
to
do
so
as
called
for
by
western
leaders
the
united
states
is
bent
on
regime
change
in
the
islamic
republic
and
therefore
any
concessions
would
be
futile
after
a
day
of
tough
talks
with
senior
iranian
officials
who
all
repeated
that
tehran
would
not
bow
to
western
pressure
to
scrap
its
ballistic
missile
tests
le
drian
said
there
remained
much
work
to
do
with
iran
we
re
not
going
to
be
donald
trump
s
envoys
or
iran
s
defence
lawyers
said
a
french
diplomatic
source
we
have
our
own
concerns
and
will
talk
to
the
different
sensibilities
of
the
iranian
system
to
get
our
point
iran
s
elite
revolutionary
guard
corps
which
answers
only
to
its
ultimate
political
authority
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
runs
the
missile
programme
our
missile
work
is
in
line
with
our
defensive
policy
which
poses
no
threat
to
any
country
the
secretary
of
iran
s
supreme
national
security
council
ali
shamkhani
told
le
drian
according
to
state
tv
to
send
a
message
to
france
iranian
media
said
shamkhani
appeared
in
military
uniform
in
his
meeting
with
le
drian
earlier
the
tasnim
news
agency
quoted
an
iranian
armed
forces
spokesman
as
saying
iran
s
missile
development
would
continue
and
foreign
powers
have
no
right
to
intervene
on
this
issue
hardline
iranian
media
reacted
angrily
to
le
drian
s
visit
with
headlines
like
the
rude
guest
and
weapons
of
mass
seduction
fars
news
agency
said
a
group
of
hardliners
gathered
at
tehran
s
international
mehrabad
airport
and
in
front
of
iran
s
foreign
ministry
to
protest
at
le
drian
s
visit
the
deal
with
france
britain
germany
russia
china
and
the
united
states
gave
iran
relief
from
economic
sanctions
in
return
for
curbs
on
its
disputed
nuclear
activity
allowing
tehran
to
talk
trade
with
europe
for
the
first
time
in
years
but
so
far
the
deal
pragmatist
president
hassan
rouhani
s
headline
achievement
has
yet
to
deliver
the
economic
benefits
many
iranians
yearn
for
that
has
impeded
efforts
by
rouhani
efforts
to
engage
with
the
west
an
approach
opposed
by
hardline
allies
of
khamenei
in
the
clerical
and
security
establishment
france
has
been
quick
to
restore
trade
ties
planemaker
airbus
oil
major
total
and
automobile
manufacturers
peugeot
and
renault
have
signed
deals
all
at
risk
if
trump
walks
out
of
the
accord
in
an
effort
to
keep
him
on
board
french
president
emmanuel
macron
has
criticised
iran
s
missile
programme
and
raised
the
possibility
of
new
sanctions
on
the
eve
of
le
drian
s
visit
macron
told
rouhani
by
phone
that
france
expects
iran
to
make
a
constructive
contribution
to
solving
crises
in
the
region
tehran
supports
syrian
president
bashar
against
rebels
including
groups
backed
by
the
west
and
also
backs
israel
s
enemy
hezbollah
in
lebanon
france
will
continue
discussions
with
iran
but
must
find
a
way
to
restore
stability
in
the
region
le
drian
told
reporters
adding
that
iranian
leaders
voiced
extreme
concern
over
syria
s
humanitarian
disaster
after
seven
years
of
war
iranian
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
told
le
drian
that
the
european
signatories
of
the
nuclear
deal
should
play
a
more
active
role
to
keep
the
accord
alive
supporting
the
accord
verbally
is
not
enough
if
the
eu
is
trying
to
salvage
the
accord
they
should
try
to
keep
iran
not
the
in
the
accord
he
said
state
tv
reported
le
drian
also
met
with
rouhani
who
told
the
french
minister
that
tehran
would
not
be
the
first
to
violate
the
nuclear
accord
according
to
state
television
nuclear
inspectors
have
repeatedly
verified
iranian
compliance
with
the
agreement
france
says
iran
has
been
committed
to
the
terms
of
the
deal
but
argues
that
tehran
may
be
violating
part
of
the
resolution
enshrining
the
accord
the
resolution
calls
on
tehran
to
refrain
from
work
on
missiles
designed
to
carry
nuclear
warheads
although
this
is
not
in
the
accord
itself
on
the
ballistics
the
iranian
programme
is
not
compatible
with
the
resolution
and
we
have
a
particular
concern
on
the
transfer
of
of
ballistic
capacity
to
regional
actors
and
by
that
we
mean
hezbollah
the
diplomatic
source
said
in
a
warning
to
trump
the
head
of
the
nuclear
watchdog
agency
in
vienna
on
monday
that
a
collapse
of
the
nuclear
deal
would
be
a
great
loss
for
nuclear
verification
and
for
multilateralism
