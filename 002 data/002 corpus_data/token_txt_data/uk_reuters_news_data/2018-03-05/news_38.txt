hopes
the
soft
power
of
cultural
diplomacy
can
help
strengthen
bilateral
ties
in
the
turbulent
ocean
of
international
diplomacy
cultural
diplomacy
is
a
beacon
we
must
keep
alight

yves
le
drian
told
a
large
audience
at
an
event
sponsored
by
french
oil
giant
total
a
french
diplomat
was
more
blunt
whatever
disagreements
we
may
have
with
iran
we
want
to
keep
and
develop
a
cultural
relationship
with
iranian
the
louvre
exhibition
in
tehran
is
the
first
by
a
major
western
cultural
institution
and
was
agreed
upon
during
a
visit
to
paris
by
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
in
when
francois
hollande
was
france
s
leader
in

said
its

was
directly
influenced
by
french
diplomatic
priorities

will
display
some
works
from
the
louvre
including
a
sphinx
statue
and
other
artefacts
linked
to
greek
egyptian
and
mesopotamian
culture
as
well
as
objects
from
ancient
iran
france
has
historically
had
a
less
fractious
relationship
with
iran
than
either
britain
or
the
united
states
while
britain
explored
for
iranian
oil
in
the
century
france
undertook
archaeological
digs
i
think
our
archaeological
past
in
iran
has
at
least
left
a
positive
imprint
the
french
diplomat
said
in
an
ironic
twist
the
louvre
in
late
opened
its
first
overseas
branch
in
abu
dhabi
capital
of
the
united
arab
emirates
which
accuses
iran
of
destabilising
the
middle
east
and
has
broken
off
diplomatic
relations
the
future
of
iran
s
nuclear
deal
with
world
powers
is
shrouded
in
doubt
after
president
donald
trump
pronounced
it
flawed
and
gave
europeans
until
may
to
fix
it
le
drian
on
monday
delivered
a
message
to
tehran
that
europe
wanted
to
keep
alive
the
accord
that
eased
economic
sanctions
in
return
for
curbs
to
its
nuclear
programme
while
echoing
concerns
about
iran
s
missile
programme
and
role
in
regional
wars
