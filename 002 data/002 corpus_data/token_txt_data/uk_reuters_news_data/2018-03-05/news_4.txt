it
won
in
a
january
auction
the

chief
told
reuters
on
monday
pemex
is
running
out
of
time
to
find
partners
for
key
oil
and
gas
projects
as
the
government
looks
to
show
progress
from
its
energy
agenda
ahead
of
a
july
presidential
election
the
oil
company
is
relying
on
foreign
capital
to
reverse
declining
output
and
refining
amid
an
ambitious
energy
reform
finding
partners
willing
to
take
part
in
the
ventures
has
indeed
taken
more
time
than
planned
but
we
are
moving
forward
pemex
director
carlos
trevino
said
in
an
interview
with
reuters
the
search
for
partners
will
start
next
year
after
completing
its
exploration
programs
the
company
has
streamlined
its
processes
and
bundling
of
assets
to
speed
up
the
farmout
process
which
requires
foreign
companies
to
buy
into
existing
pemex
projects
we
have
reduced
internal
approval
times
to
days
and
formed
clusters
of
blocks
to
configure
projects
he
said
the
company
will
start
talks
with
oil
companies
including
chevron
corp
japan
s
inpex
corp
and
australia
s
bhp
billiton
ltd
which
are
its
partners
in
other
oil
and
gas
projects

conference
pemex
also
expects
to
find
companies
this
year
to
invest
in
its
and
projects
in
mexico
s
gulf
under
more
flexible
terms
after
failing
to
land
partners
for
those
developments
in
mexico
blames
the
lack
of
interest
in
the
projects
on
competition
from
brazil
s
offshore
offerings
low
oil
prices
and
costs
pemex
previously
incurred
that
would
be
transferred
to
the
partners
pemex
this
year
will
offer
eight
onshore
projects
including
oil
blocks
for
partnerships
in
an
auction

declined
in
intends
to
participate

unconventional
blocks
at
the
border
with
the
united
states
it
would
like

it
could
look
for
partners
he
said
mexico
enacted
a
reform
in
to
encourage
foreign
investment
and
end
a
multiyear
slide
in
oil
output
the
reform
ended
pemex

monopoly
over

revenue
generator
for
the

and
production

been
signed
