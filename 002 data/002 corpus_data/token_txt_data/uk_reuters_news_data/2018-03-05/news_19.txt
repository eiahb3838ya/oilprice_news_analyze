will
go
hunting
for
assets
to
buy
this
year
and
bid
in
oil
auctions
in
the
united

and

after
emerging
from
a
period
of
deep
budget
cutbacks
chief
executive
felipe
bayon
told
reuters
on
monday
low
crude
oil
prices
had
forced
ecopetrol
and
other
oil
companies
in
latin
america
to
tighten
their
belts
in
recent
years
cutting
exploration
investment
or
delaying
key
projects
and
severely
hitting
output
and

colombia
s
ecopetrol
halted
production
at
oilfields
as
it
reduced
spending
last
week
it
reported
a
net
profit
of
billion
in
the
highest
in
the
last
four
years
last
year
was
a
very
good
year
for
us
analysts
were
expecting
a
lower
profit
bayon
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
ceraweek
energy
conference
in
houston
the
company
expects
its
oil
and
gas
production
to
remain
flat
or
to
rise
slightly
this
year
to
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
boepd
under
an
investment
budget
of
billion
almost
completely
focused
on
exploration
and
production
part
of
that
spending
will
go
to
projects
aimed
at
replenishing
the
firm
s
energy
reserves
including
a
pilot
program
to
explore
unconventional
resources
at
the
magdalena
medio
basin
where
ecopetrol
estimates
there
could
be
up
to
billion
barrels
more
than
triple
colombia
s
proven
reserves
ecopetrol
last
year
was
part
of
a
team
that
won
an
offshore
block
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
latin
american
countries
holding
oil
auctions
this
year
include
ecuador
uruguay
brazil
and
argentina
ecopetrol
s
main
refinery
the
recently
expanded
cartagena
has
increased
crude
processing
to
barrels
per
day
while
reducing
the
proportion
of
imported
crude
it
needs
to
percent
versus
to
percent
a
year
ago
bayon
said
the
cost
of
cartagena
s
modernization
doubled
to
billion
compared
with
the
billion
originally
planned
but
it
has
made
the
company
less
dependent
on
imports
while
leaving
a
small
fuel
surplus
for
export
ecopetrol
is
also
reducing
the
volume
of
imported
naphtha
it
needs
to
dilute
its
heavy
crude
output
by
making
changes
at
its
transportation
system
according
to
bayon
using
alternative
transport
has
allowed
it
to
avoid
problems
at
the
closed
cano
pipeline
which
has
been
the
target
of
frequent
rebel
attacks
bayon
also
said
that
tighter
controls
by
the
colombian
government
at
the
venezuelan
border
had
cut
illegal
gasoline
imports
increasing
the
domestic
need
for
gasoline
and
other
fuels
ecopetrol
s
barrancabermeja

recently
went
on

due
to
