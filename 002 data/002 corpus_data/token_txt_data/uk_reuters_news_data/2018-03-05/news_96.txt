we

the
different
sensibilities
of
the
iranian
system
to
get
our
point
trump
has
said
european
allies

and
the
united
states
gave
iran
relief
from
economic
sanctions
in
return
for
curbs
to
its
nuclear
programme
allowing
tehran
to
talk
trade
with
europe
for
the
first
time
in
years
france
has
been
quick
to
restore
trade
ties
planemaker
airbus
oil
major

automobile
manufacturers
peugeot
and
renault
have
signed
deals
all
of
which
could
be
at
risk
if
trump
walks
out
of
the
accord
in
an
effort
to
keep
him
on
board
french
president
emmanuel
macron
has
criticised
iran
s
ballistics
programme
and
raised
the
possibility
of
new
sanctions
on
the
eve
of
le
drian
s
visit
he
told
president
hassan
rouhani
france
expects
iran
to
make
a
constructive
contribution
to
solving
crises
in
the
middle
east
macron
s
office
said
on
sunday
tehran
supports
syrian
president
bashar
against
rebels
including
groups
backed
by
the
west
and
backs
israel
s
enemy
hezbollah
in
lebanon
the
two
presidents
agreed
in
their
phone
call
to
work
together
in
the
coming
days
with
the
united
nations
the
syrian
government
and
other
countries
involved
to
improve
the
situation
for
civilians
and
make
a
ceasefire
effective
paris
said
france
has
urged
washington
to
see
the
nuclear
deal
separately
from
iran
s
regional
activities
and
its
missile
programme
and
le
drian
will
stress
macron
s
commitment
to
the
nuclear
accord
especially
as
iran
is
respecting
its
terms
french
officials
said
le
drian
is
due
to
meet
rouhani
and
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
as
well
as
officials
close
to
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
including
ali
shamkhani
secretary
of
the
supreme
national
security
council
khamenei
said
on
march
that
iran
would
keep
supporting
assad
s
war
effort
and
a
foreign
ministry
spokesman
on
sunday
rejected
macron
s
comments
about
iran
s
missile
programme
insisting
its
defensive
missile
work
would
continue
an
official
close
to
rouhani
said
iran
has
always
been
open
to
talks
and
to
resolve
issues
through
diplomacy
but
this
does
not
mean
we
will
yield
to
unjust
pressure
over
our
inevitable
rights
whether
defensive
or
anything
while
france
says
iran
is
sticking
to
the
terms
of
the
nuclear
deal
it
may
not
be
respecting
part
of
resolution
that
calls
on
it
to
refrain
from
work
on
ballistic
missiles
designed
to
carry
nuclear
warheads
the
resolution
enshrines
the
nuclear
deal
which
itself
makes
no
explicit
reference
to
the
ballistics
programme
but
it
is
unclear
whether
the
wording
binds
tehran
to
an
obligatory
commitment
on
missiles
on
the
ballistics
the
iranian
programme
is
not
compatible
with
and
we
have
a
particular
concern
on
the
transfer
of
of
ballistic
capacity
to
regional
actors
and
by
that
we
mean
hezbollah
said
the
diplomatic
source
a
second
diplomat
said
while
our
concerns
aren
t
directly
linked
to
the
nuclear
deal
it
s
important
we
make
progress
on
these
other
subjects
because
otherwise
trump
risks
