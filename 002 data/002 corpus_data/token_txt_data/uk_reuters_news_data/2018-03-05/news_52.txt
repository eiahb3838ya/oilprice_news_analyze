a
collapse
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
would
be
a
great
loss
the
atomic
watchdog
s
chief
warned
president
donald
trump
on
monday
giving
a
defence
of
the
accord
and
his
agency
s
work
under
it
trump
has
threatened
to
withdraw
the
united
states
from
the
accord
between
tehran
and
six
world
powers
signed
in
before
he
took
office
unless
congress
and
european
allies
help
fix
it
with
a
pact
trump
does
not
like
the
deal
s
limited
duration
among
other
things
iran
has
stayed
within
the
deal
s
restrictions
since
trump
took
office
but
has
fired
diplomatic
warning
shots
at
washington
in
recent
weeks
it
said
on
monday
that
it
could
rapidly
enrich
uranium
to
a
higher
degree
of
purity
if
the
deal
collapsed
if
the
jcpoa
were
to
fail
it
would
be
a
great
loss
for
nuclear
verification
and
for
multilateralism
international
atomic
energy
agency
iaea
chief
yukiya
amano
said
in
a
speech
to
his
agency
s
board
of
governors
using
the
deal
s
official
name
the
joint
comprehensive
plan
of
action
amano
whose
agency
polices
the
deal
s
nuclear
restrictions
later
gave
his
most
defence
of
the
accord
to
date
listing
numbers
of
buildings
inspected
images
captured
and
even
seals
placed
on
equipment
since
the
accord
was
put
into
effect
the
iaea
now
has
the
world
s
most
robust
verification
regime
in
place
in
iran
we
have
had
access
to
all
locations
that
we
needed
to
visit
the
veteran
japanese
diplomat
told
a
news
conference
after
his
speech
amano
declined
to
comment
on
the
position
of
the
united
states
or
any
other
country
but
his
remarks
were
clearly
a
response
to
trump
s
threat
to
scupper
the
accord
which
also
lifted
painful
economic
sanctions
against
iran
we
have
carried
out
more
than
complementary
accesses
and
visited
more
than
buildings
since
jcpoa
implementation
day
he
said
referring
to
a
specific
type
of
inspection
under
the
iaea
s
additional
protocol
which
iran
is
implementing
under
the
deal
washington
is
telling
european
allies
it
wants
a
agreement
that
ensures
strong
iaea
inspections
according
to
a
state
department
cable
obtained
by
reuters
last
month
that
suggests
that
from
washington
s
standpoint
there
is
something
deficient
about
the
current
inspection
system
trump
and
his
ambassador
to
the
united
nations
nikki
haley
have
made
similar
comments
but
diplomats
familiar
with
the
iaea
s
thinking
have
said
the
trump
administration
s
view
arises
from
a
poor
understanding
of
how
the
iaea
does
its
work
in
iran
iran
said
on
monday
it
could
produce
higher
enriched
uranium
within
two
days
if
it
were
no
longer
bound
by
the
deal
if
america
pulls
out
of
the
deal
iran
could
resume
its
percent
uranium
enrichment
in
less
than
hours
behrouz
kamalvandi
spokesman
for
the
atomic
energy
organisation
of
iran
told
arabic
language
tv
iran
is
not
allowed
to
enrich
uranium
beyond
percent
fissile
purity
under
the
deal
a
level
that
is
suitable
for
fuelling
some
civilian
nuclear
power
stations
and
far
short
of
the
percent
that
is
considered
weapons
grade
kamalvandi
reiterating
tehran
s
official
stance
said
the
nuclear
deal
is
not
the
other
countries
that
signed
the
deal
germany
britain
france
russia
and
china
are
committed
to
preserving
it
as
mentioned
in
a
quarterly
iaea
report
on
iran
last
month
amano
said
in
his
speech
that
the
agency
had
requested
clarification
from
iran
about
its
plans
for
naval
vessels
suggesting
the
iaea
has
still
not
heard
back
from
the
islamic
republic
iran
has
long
said
publicly
that
it
intends
to
develop
nuclear
propulsion
for
naval
vessels
though
analysts
and
diplomats
say
that
remains
a
distant
prospect
it
formally
notified
the
iaea
of
that
intention
in
january
in
what
was
widely
seen
as
a
rebuff
to
pressure
from
trump
