the
opinions
expressed
here
are
those
of
the
author
a
columnist
for
reuters
by

at
times
when
fear
and
loathing
are
it
often
pays
to
take
a
more
dispassionate
look
at
what
is
likely
to
happen
as
opposed
to
what
is
feared
will
happen
the
planned
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
certainly
had
the
effect
of
raising
political
and
economic
temperatures
across
the
world
amid
fears
that
president
donald
trump
is
taking
the
first
step
in
a
global
trade
war
that
will
end
in
a
depression
however
there
is
still
a
long
road
to
travel
from
the
imposition
of
tariffs
of
percent
on
steel
and
percent
on
aluminium
to
a
collapse
of
the
war
ii
global
economic
order
even
if
you
believe
trump
has
opened
that
door
and
is
preparing
to
charge
through
it
much
will
depend
on
what
the
rest
of
the
world
does
in
response
to
the
moves
the
smart
play
is
probably
to
condemn
vociferously
in
public
but
to
do
very
little
in
terms
of
retaliation
while
at
the
same
time
reaching
out
to
the
trump
administration
in
the
hope
of
toning
down
its
rhetoric
and
actions
assuming
trump
s
measures
don
t
spark
an
ongoing
trade
war
it
will
likely
become
clear
that
the
tariffs
are
likely
to
have
only
a
small
impact
on
global
commodities
and
are
effectively
an
for
the
united
states
that
s
a
big
assumption
and
one
not
yet
in
evidence
given
trump
has
seemingly
on
his
views
saying
in
a
tweet
that
trade
wars
are
good
and
easy
to
win
a
phrase
that
may
yet
become
his
political
epitaph
but
the
extent
of
the
poor
reaction
to
the
planned
tariffs
especially
from
industries
trump
has
counted
among
his
supporters
such
as
oil
and
gas
coupled
with
the
negative
reaction
of
equity
markets
may
yet
give
his
administration
pause
for
thought
at
any
rate
assuming
a
global
trade
war
can
be
avoided
the
effect
of
the
tariffs
should
be
to
make
steel
and
aluminium
more
expensive
inside
the
country
while
making
it
relatively
cheaper
elsewhere
in
the
world
if
countries
that
export
to
the
united
states
find
they
can
no
longer
ship
the
same
volumes
they
can
either
find
new
markets
or
cut
production
given
that
china
the
world
s
top
steel
producer
only
ships
a
fraction
of
its
exports
to
the
united
states
it
s
likely
to
be
the
least
affected
among
asia
s
steel
makers
japan
and
south
korea
may
find
the
going
tougher
but
if
those
countries
do
end
up
with
steel
gluts
it
will
likely
lower
costs
for
their
significant
automotive
industries
thus
improving
their
export
competitiveness
aluminium
is
also
a
major
input
into
car
manufacturing
as
well
as
in
other
manufactured
goods
that
are
commonly
imported
by
the
united
states
canada
brazil
and
mexico
the
and
steel
exporters
to
the
united
states
respectively
will
find
it
tough
to
compete
in
asian
markets
and
are
therefore
most
at
risk
from
trump
s
planned
tariffs
at
the
margin
lower
brazilian
steel
exports
may
free
up
some
iron
ore
for
increased
exports
but
it
seems
likely
at
this
stage
that
seaborne
iron
ore
is
unlikely
to
suffer
much
change
to
either
demand
or
supply
from
the
tariffs
looking
at
other
commodities
it
s
likely
that
a
similar
pattern
emerges
namely
that
the
united
states
hurts
itself
more
than
others
while
steel
tariffs
won
t
directly
increase
the
cost
of
crude
oil
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
and
coal
in
the
united
states
it
will
deliver
an
indirect
impost
given
these
industries
use
steel
as
an
input
pipelines
import
and
export
terminals
railroads
and
mines
are
all
significant
steel
consumers
and
higher
costs
for
producers
of
oil
lng
and
coal
will
serve
to
erode
their
margins
against
competitors
elsewhere
in
the
world
again
much
of
this
is
at
the
margin
with
higher
steel
costs
likely
to
make
only
a
tiny
difference
to
actual
costs
for
producing
the
commodities
that
the
united
states
exports
far
more
important
is
the
likely
hit
to
sentiment
which
is
firstly
commodity
exporters
that
are
currently
enjoying
good
times
in
crude
lng
and
coal
are
likely
to
be
somewhat
more
cautious
in
planning
capital
expenditure
secondly
buyers
of
commodity
exports
while
still
largely
driven
by
price
may
subtly
change
their
buying
patterns
in
favour
of
other
suppliers
given
the
increasing
view
in
the
rest
of
the
world
that
trump
s
america
isn
t
a
friendly
place
to
do
business
with
for
example
a
south
korean
buyer
of
lng
or
coal
may
choose
to
buy
from
australia
instead
of
the
united
states
if
the
price
differential
is
small
as
a
subtle
way
of
getting
back
at
trump
for
hurting
south
korea
s
steel
industry
again
none
of
this
is
certain
and
behavioural
economics
are
far
from
an
exact
science
i
ve
had
a
lot
of
worries
in
my
life
most
of
which
never
happened
american
writer
and
humorist
mark
twain
wrote
trump
s
proposed
tariffs
have
certainly
increased
the
world
s
worries
but
if
the
response
is
mature
and
considered
the
worst
fears
may
not
be
realised
