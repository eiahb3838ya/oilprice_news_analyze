the

bullish
positions
in

remain
at
levels
that
had
never
been
recorded
before
the
start

this

holding
long

amounting
to
more

million

few
dare
express
a
contrary
bearish

short

actually
declined
by

just
million

lowest

lopsided
hedge

positioning
remains
an
important

of
downside
risk
to

prices
if

try

realise
some
of

most

seem
convinced
prices

rise
further

eventual
correction
global
growth
remains
strong
and
oil
consumption
is
set
to
increase

more

opec

willingness

sacrifice
market

has
convinced
many
investors
that
downside

is
limited
in
the
near
