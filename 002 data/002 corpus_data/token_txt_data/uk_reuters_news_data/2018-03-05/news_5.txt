prices
rallied
on
monday
and
stocks
across
the
globe
also
rose
as

a
negotiating
tactic
and
not
a
done
deal
while
concern
ebbed
over
an
inconclusive
italian
election

trump
to

we
have
at

a

of
a

he
said
the
trump
administration
sees
the
stock

as
a
report
card
for
success
and
markets
have
so
far
said
this
trade
war
is
not
a
good
trump
s
hard
talk
regarding
steel
and
aluminum
tariffs
sounds
like
we
re
shifting
back
to
posturing
to
get
a
better
nafta
deal
hogan
added
trump
said
on
monday
that
canada
and

while
