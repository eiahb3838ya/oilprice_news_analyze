according

it

been
increasing

with
four
other
southeast

nations
including
brunei
over
competing

to

atolls
in

building

and
offering

part
of

matters
said
jatswan
singh
associate
professor
at
the
university
of
malaya
in
kuala
lumpur
who
has
authored
four
books
on
brunei
the
sultanate
is
for
investments
to
diversify
its
economy
and
in
this
sense
the
chinese
investments
are
important
to
brunei
he
said
brunei
has
not
commented
publicly
about
its
territorial
claims
in
the
south
china
sea
there
was
a
time
not
so
long
ago
with
oil
prices
over
a
barrel
when
brunei
citizens
could
care
less
about
jobs
at
a
refinery
squeezed
between
two
malaysian
states
on
the
island
of
borneo
brunei
provided
benefits
for
its
citizens
including
zero
taxes
subsidised
housing
and
free
education
and
health
care
but
the
sultan
has
had
to
whittle
back
some
of
those
benefits
brunei
has
been
in
recession
for
three
straight
years
and
tighten
up
the
ship
of

the
bolkiah
the
world
s
reigning
monarch
reshuffled
his
cabinet
again
last
month
replacing
six
top
ministers
just
over
a
couple
of
years
after
they
were
appointed
no
explanation
was
given
sources
close
to
the
government
and
foreign
diplomats
say
bolkiah
wanted
to
weed
out
corruption
and
address
grumbling
among
the
majority
who
are
unhappy
with
the
pullback
in
welfare
programs
budget
cuts
and
unemployment
in
the
last
available
official
report
in
the
unemployment
rate
was
put
at
percent
unofficial
figures
suggest
youth
unemployment
could
be
as
high
as
percent
a
majority
in
brunei
expect
a
job
in
the
government
state
linked
firms
or
in
the
oil
and
gas
sector
but
all
three
have
been
hit
pretty
hard
said
one
western
diplomat
bolkiah
who
is
also
the
prime
minister
controls
the
key
portfolios
of
defence
finance
and
foreign
affairs
the
sultan
s
office
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
and
newly
appointed
ministers
refused
to
comment
during
national
day
celebrations
last
week
the
sultan
however
is
still
popular
he
marked
years
in
power
last
october
with
a
glittering
procession
through
the
capital
on
a
gilded
chariot
cheered
by
but
in
the
long
run
an
economy
based
on
dwindling
single
source
of
income
could
erode
the
relationship
between
the
ruler
and
his
subjects
said
muang
zarni
democracy
advocate
and
a
former
research
fellow
at
the
london
school
of
economics
that
doesn
t
mean
that
will
translate
into
street
protests
but
bruneians
know
things
are
not
as
rosy
as
they
appear
in
the
sultan
s
newspapers
and
tv
channels
