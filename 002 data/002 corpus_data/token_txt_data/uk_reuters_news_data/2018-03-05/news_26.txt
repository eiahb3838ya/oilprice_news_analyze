update 4-iea sees u.s. oil output surge stealing opec share in next 5 years
reuters
shale
oil
output
is
set
to
surge
over
the
next
five
years
stealing
market
share
from
opec
producers
and
moving
the
united
states
once
the
world
s
top
oil
importer
closer
to
self
sufficiency
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
monday
a
landmark
deal
in
between
opec
and
rivals
including
russia
to
curb
output
to
reduce
global
oversupply
improved
the
outlook
for
other
producers
as
prices
rose
sharply
throughout
the
year

an
annual
report
looking
at
the
next
five
years
with
supply
surging
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
will
see
demand
for
its
crude
fall
below
current
production
in
and
the
report
forecast
suggesting
a
return
to
oversupply
if
opec
output
keeps
steady
oil
output
hit
a
record
late
last
year
and
is
expected
to
rise
by
million
barrels

to
million

from

more
than

to
grow
by

executive
director
in
a
statement
birol
speaking
at
a

briefing
at
the
ceraweek
energy
conference
in
houston
said
output
forecasts
could
be
revised
upward
if
oil
remains
above
a
barrel
he
said
he
expects
shale
output
to
keep
rising
regardless
of
opec
policies
and
said
opec
and
other
established
oil
producers
need
to
reconsider
their
future
growth
plans
in
light
of
huge
growth
from
shale
he
also
said
he
expects
export
capacity
to
double
over
the
next
five
years
with
total
liquids
production
set
to
reach
nearly
million
bpd

growth
through
the
iea
said
adding
that
more
investment
would
be
needed
to
boost
output
after
that
production
is
set
to
rise
by
million
bpd
by
to
million

with
the

alone
accounting
for
nearly
percent
of
global

growth
production
in
rose
by

as
drillers
added
rigs
beating
all
expectations
the
iea
said
output
from
opec
producers
will
grow
at
a
much
slower
pace
the
iea
said
adding
it
expected
venezuelan
production
declines
to
accelerate
offsetting
gains
in
iraq
birol
said
venezuela
s
production
outlook
may
need
to
be
cut
in
coming
years
as
well
as
a
result
opec
s
crude
oil
capacity
will
grow
by
just
bpd
by
the
iea
said
with
shale
and
other
supply
rising
demand
for
opec
crude
plus
withdrawals
from
inventories
will
average
million
bpd
in
the
iea
said
million
bpd
less
than
its
last
forecast
this
is
lower
than
demand
of
million
bpd
expected
in
and
below
the
iea
s
latest
estimate
of
opec
s
production
of
million
bpd
with
forecast
capacity
of
million
bpd
opec
will
be
supplying
less
than
percent
of
global
demand
by
compared
to
its
historic
share
around
percent
boosted
by
economic
growth
in
asia
and
a
resurgent
petrochemicals
industry
global
oil
demand
will
increase
by
million
bpd
by
to
million
according
to
the
iea
despite
steep
oil
production
gains
the
iea
warned
that
a
decline
in
mature
fields
meant
more
investment
was
needed
across
the
globe
after
upstream
investment
shows
little
sign
of
recovering
from
its
plunge
in
which
raises
concerns
about
whether
adequate
supply
will
be
available
to
offset
natural
field
declines
and
meet
