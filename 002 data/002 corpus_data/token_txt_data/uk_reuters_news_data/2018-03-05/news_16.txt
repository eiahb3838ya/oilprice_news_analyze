chevron
corp
is
exploring
options
including
the
sale
of
a
minority
stake
in
its
canadian
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
project
as
it
pushes
ahead
three
people
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
among
the
parties
in
talks
with
chevron
for
a
possible
stake
in
kitimat
lng
are
petroliam
nasional
bhd
or
petronas
which
scrapped
its
own
billion
lng
project
in
british
columbia
last
year
due
to
challenging
market
conditions
two
of
the
people
said
reuters
spoke
over
the
past
week
to
the
sources
who
said
there
is
no
certainty
that
chevron
would
proceed
with
the
stake
sale
the
persons
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
the
process
is
private
chevron
declined
to
comment
and
petronas
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
chevron
is
also
considering
selling
a
stake
in
the
project
to
a
financial
investor
such
as
a
canadian
pension
fund
or
a
private
equity
firm
the
people
added
canadian
companies
seven
generations
energy
ltd
and
tourmaline
oil
corp
are
in
discussions
to
supply
natural
gas
to
chevron
s
project
the
people
said
seven
generations
may
also
consider
buying
a
stake
in
the
project
by
partnering
with
other
gas
producers
the
people
said
while
any
possible
deal
with
a
financial
investor
would
be
strictly
a
cash
infusion
to
help
support
the
cost
of
building
the
project
a
deal
with
a
producer
could
be
structured
as
a
commitment
to
supply
natural
gas
to
the
plant
for
a
period
of
to
years
the
people
said
canadian
pension
funds
have
a
huge
appetite
for
assets
that
offer
stable
cash
flows
over
a
long
period
and
pipeline
investments
tend
to
have
those
attributes
the
project

british
columbia

joint
venture

woodside
petroleum
ltd
has
a
export
license
for
lng
and
is
expected
to
cost
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
to
build
kitimat
could
become
one
of
the
largest
capital
investments
in
a
canadian
energy
project
chevron
says
on
its
website
taking
such
a
substantial
investment
decision
has
been
difficult
for
the
duo
given
concerns
over
a
global
lng
supply
glut
for
the
last
three
years
fierce
political
opposition
in
western
canada
to
building
pipelines
and
other
energy
infrastructure
has
also
escalated
in
the
last
several
years
however
surging
gas
demand
from
china
and
southeast
asia
is
reassuring
export
project
developers
that
the
market
cycle
is
finally
beginning
to
turn
