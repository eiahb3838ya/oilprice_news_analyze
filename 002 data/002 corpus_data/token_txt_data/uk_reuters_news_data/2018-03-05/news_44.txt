britain
s
efforts
to
attract
the
stock
market
listing
of
oil
firm
saudi
aramco
could
cost
london
its
reputation
for
good
corporate
governance
the
head
of
an
influential
committee
said
on
monday
ahead
of
a
visit
by
the
saudi
crown
prince
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
heir
apparent
to
the
saudi
throne
will
spend
three
days
in
london
this
week
as
part
of
a
tour
designed
to
reassure
allies
about
his
domestic
reforms
and
ease
investor
concerns
about
a
corruption
crackdown
the
overseas
trip
crown
prince
mohammed
s
first
since
he
in
effect
took
over
the
running
of
the
country
last
year
will
be
followed
by
talks
in
the
united
states
making
it
the
latest
staging
ground
for
an
international
tug
of
war
over
the
aramco
public
offering
both
britain
and
the
united
states
are
keen
to
secure
the
listing
which
could
be
the
largest
ever
britain
s
financial
regulators
are
considering
a
relaxation
of
rules
that
would
allow
companies
like
aramco
to
list
on
the
stock
market
in
london
but
that
move
has
prompted
concern
among
some
in
britain
s
parliament
the
uk
currently
has
strict
corporate
governance
rules
and
it
s
vital
that
they
aren
t
watered
down
to
secure
the
listing
of
saudi
aramco
sending
a
message
which
risks
our
reputation
and
which
may
ultimately
damage
our
attractiveness
to
foreign
investment

not
immediately
have
a
comment
when
asked
about
the
type
of
concerns
raised
by
reeves
crown
prince
mohammed
is
not
due
to
meet
financial
regulators
during
his
visit
but
the
topic
is
likely
to
feature
in
talks
with
may
who
has
previously
said
the
london
stock
exchange
has
made
a
strong
case
to
host
the
listing
reeves
a
member
of
the
opposition
labour
party
also
questioned
the
value
of
winning
the
listing
to
the
wider
british
economy
outside
the
city
of
london
financial
district
the
city
and
advisors
may
stand
to
benefit
from
the
lse
landing
saudi
aramco
but
what
does
this
potential
listing
offer
in
terms
of
investment
or
jobs
in
the
uk
