italian

delivered
a
hung
parliament
on
sunday
flocking
to
and
parties
in
record
numbers
and
casting
the
euro
zone
s

into
a
political

that
could

traded

president

the
messy
italian

result
adds
a
bit
to
the
nervousness
to
global
equity
markets
at
present
said
shane
oliver
chief
economist
at
amp
the
italian
election
does
run
the
risk
of
making
italy
s
public
finances
worse
than
they
already
are
with
no
progress
in
addressing
italy
s
competitiveness
the
euro
still
found
support
after
germany
s
social
democrat
party
decisively
backed
the
renewal
of
an
alliance
with
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
conservatives
allowing
her
to
form
a
new
government
more
than
five
months
since
the
country
s
inconclusive
election
the
single
currency
also
got
a
lift
from
some
flows
as
did
the
japanese
yen
the
dollar
fell
for
a
fourth
straight
session
to
trade
around
yen
but
was
slightly
above
friday
s
low
of
a
level
not
seen
since
november
nothing
s
happened
over
the
weekend
to
soften
concerns
about
trade
wars
or
retaliatory
actions
by
other
countries
said
ray
attrill
head
of
forex
strategy
at
national
australia
bank
there
is
no
rowing
back
so
that
gets
us
to
a
cautious
canada
and
mexico
have
threatened
retaliation
and
the
european
union
said
it
would
apply
percent
tariffs
on
about
billion
of
imports
from
the
united
states
if
trump
carried
out
his
threat
china
said
on
sunday
it
did
not
want
a
trade
war
with
the
united
states
but
will
defend
its
interests
warning
that
policies
based
on
mistaken
assumptions
will
damage
bilateral
relations
investors
fear
the
current
momentum
in
the
global
economy
could
be
lost
if
trump
starts
a
trade
war
asian
markets
were
a
sea
of
red
with
japan
s
nikkei
and
south
korea
s
kospi
both
down
about
percent
while
chinese
shares
eased
too
after
starting
on
a
positive
note
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
index
slipped
percent
frustration
with
a
lack
of
market
access
and
a
lack
of
fair
trade
are
understandable
said
peter
jolly
global
head
of
research
for
national
australia
bank
if
this
escalation
draws
that
into
focus
with
some
improvement
that
would
be
positive
but
retaliatory
measures
would
weigh
against
market
access
a
cost
to
growth
with
increases
in
trade
prices
costs
and
investors
will
keep
an
eye
on
a
deluge
of
data
this
week
culminating
in
the
payrolls
on
friday
the
annual
opening
of
the
national
people
s
congress
in
china
was
