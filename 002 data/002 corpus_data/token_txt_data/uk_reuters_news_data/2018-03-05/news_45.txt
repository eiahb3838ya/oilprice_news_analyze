update 1-oil demand growth to shift to petrochemicals away from motor fuels - iea
london
reuters
strong
global
demand
for
oil
and
gas
will
shift
in
the
next
five
years
toward
petrochemicals
and
away
from
motor
fuels
gasoline
and
diesel
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
on
monday
demand
for
products
ranging
from
fertilisers
to
plastics
and
beauty
products
will
drive
roughly
a
quarter
of
the
expected
oil
demand
growth
to
the
iea
said
in
its
outlook
the
shift
represents
a
major
challenge
to
the
oil
industry
as
many
of
the
petrochemicals
will
be
produced
using
gas
cutting
out
refineries
at
the
same
time
growth
in
gasoline
and
diesel
usage
will
be
held
back
by
fuel
efficiency
improvements
and
declining
consumption
in
the
developed
world
the
iea
said
world
oil
demand
is
expected
to
rise
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
it
said
with
a
quarter
of
this
growth
or
million
bpd
coming
from
demand
for
petrochemical
feedstocks
ethane
and
naphtha
global
economic
growth
is
lifting
more
people
into
the
middle
class
in
developing
countries
and
higher
incomes
mean
sharply
rising
demand
for
consumer
goods
and
services
the
iea
said
a
large
group
of
chemicals
derived
from
oil
and
natural
gas
are
crucial
to
the
manufacture
of
many
products
that
satisfy
this
rising
demand
it
added
naphtha
is
made
by
oil
refineries
processing
crude
but
other
petrochemical
feedstocks
ethane
or
liquefied
petroleum
gas
lpg
are
processed
outside
traditional
oil
refineries
ethane
liquefied
petroleum
gases
and
naphtha
pose
a
bigger
threat
to
the
refiners
market
share
than
electric
vehicles
and
transportation
combined
the
iea
said
estimating
refiners
would
see
just
million
bpd
of
the
demand
growth
to
missing
out
on
percent
of
it
the
boom
in
shale
oil
has
dramatically
expanded
the
availability
of
ethane
and
a
string
of
new
projects
on
the
gulf
coast
are
underway
to
process
it
in
total
the
world
is
expected
to
add
million
bpd
in
new
steam
crackers
to
the
iea
said
demand
for
ethane
will
expand
at
the
fastest
pace
in
the
next
five
years
rising
by
bpd
followed
by
naphtha
with
growth
of
bpd
and
lpg
with
growth
of
bpd
it
forecast
jet
fuel
supported
by
growing
demand
for
air
travel
will
grow
by
percent
to
the
iea
added
but
it
said
demand
for
gasoline
and
diesel
would
rise
by
just
percent
each
with
expansion
slowed
by
fuel
efficiency
standards
that
now
cover
two
thirds
of
the
world
s
top
car
markets
more
than
percent
of
global
car
sales
are
now
in
markets
covered
by
efficiency
standards
including
china
india
the
united
states
and
europe
the
iea
said
this
will
impact
strongly
on
future
oil
partially
as
a
result
the
iea
warned
that
refinery
additions
totaling
million
bpd
would
outstrip
growth
in
demand
for
refined
products
by
by
some
million
bpd
the
gap
between
refinery
capacity
growth
and
refined
product
demand
growth
has
never
been
so
large
in
recent
history
