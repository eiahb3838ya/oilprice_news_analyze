france
called
on
other
eu
nations
to
adopt
a
regional
carbon
price
floor
for
power
generators
to
promote
a
shift
away
from
coal
to
more
fuels
at
a
conference
hosted
by
france
on
monday
to
debate
the
issue
french
ecology
minister
brune
poirson
called
for
a
price
floor
of
from
to
euros
per
ton
in
power
generation
to
help
accelerate
the
shift
from
coal
to
gas
and
renewables
power
generation
accounts
for
about
a
fifth
of
the
bloc
s
total
emissions
the
prices
are
often
too
weak
to
push
real
changes
in
behavior
and
yet
this
is
what
we
need
if
we
are
going
to
accelerate
the
fight
against
climate
change
poirson
said
the
conference
in
brussels
brought
together
officials
from
france
germany
britain
finland
the
netherlands
and
sweden
to
discuss
how
to
send
a
strong
market
signal
toward
meeting
the
bloc
s
goals
of
reducing
greenhouse
gases
by
at
least
percent
by
carbon
prices
under
the
european
emissions
trading
system
ets
which
charges
more
than
companies
for
each
ton
of
carbon
dioxide
they
emit
have
suffered
from
a
glut
of
permits
prompting
reforms
agreed
this
year
benchmark
prices
in
the
eu
s
system
hit
on
monday
analysts
expect
prices
to
continue
rising
as
measures
designed
to
curb
supply
from
get
closer
it
s
true
we
have
reformed
the
european
trading
scheme
but
with
the
expected
price
levels
for
emission
permits
coal
will
remain
the
most
competitive
fossil
fuel
for
years
to
come
poirson
said
such
a
regional
initiative
could
bring
additional
emission
reductions
revenues
for
national
budgets
and
reduce
the
need
to
subsidize
renewables
she
argued
traders
however
said
there
is
little
expectation
a
floor
price
would
ever
materialize
in
the
eu
s
trading
system
it
s
really
not
realistic
one
carbon
trader
said
and
i
don
t
see
what
the
point
would
be
they
ve
just
passed
very
ambitious
market
reforms
which
will
lead
to
