the
world
s
largest
oil
producers
appealed
to
shale
producers
to
join
their
efforts
to
hold
global
prices
at
their
current
level
at
a
major
energy
conference
monday
as
the
boom
in
shale
is
continuing
to
undermine
opec
s
production
curbs
opec
secretary
general
mohammed
barkindo
said
monday
at
the
ceraweek
conference
in
houston
that
there
is
a
common
understanding
between
nations
and
shale
producers
that
we
all
belong
to
this
industry
even
as
exports
have
eroded
opec
s
market
share
over
the
last
year
this
year
s
ceraweek
conference
continues
outreach
between
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
shale
producers
members
of
opec
will
meet
with
shale
producers
on
monday
evening
at
a
dinner
for
the
second
year
in
a
row
though
barkindo
said
that
price
levels
and
production
will
not
be
discussed
however
shale
s
surge
in
the
last
year
was
heavy
on
the
minds
at
the
houston
conference
particularly
as
production
surged
to
an
record
late
last
year
nigeria
s
oil
minister
emmanuel
ibe
kachikwu
was
more
explicit
than
barkindo
saying
that
oil
majors
operating
in
both
shale
fields
and
in
opec
members
should
bear
some
responsibility
for
prices
we
need
to
begin
to
look
at
companies
that
are
very
active
in
these
areas
and
begin
to
get
them
to
take
some
responsibilities
in
terms
of
stability
of
oil
prices
kachikwu
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
the
ceraweek
energy
conference
in
houston
though
he
did
not
name
any
specific
companies
some
of
the
same
companies
that
are
working
in
shale
are
the
same
companies
working
in
opec
member
countries
the
price
of
oil
rose
steadily
throughout
in
the
wake
an
agreement
between
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
including
russia
to
cut
production
by
million
barrels
a
day
beginning
last
year
that
surge
in
prices
however
boosted
production
sharply
which
hit
a
record
in
november
at
more
than
million
barrels
a
day
and
is
expected
to
surpass
million
barrels
a
day
later
this
year
going
forward
fatih
birol
head
of
the
international
energy
agency
said
here
in
houston
that
shale
growth
may
continue
to
rise
regardless
of
opec
policies
warning
that
larger
producers
may
need
to
reconsider
their
future
growth
given
huge
growth
in
shale
rising
prices
have
shale
producers
pumping
more
while
opec
has
maintained
its
price
cuts
with
output
from
members
at
a
low
the
cartel
s
leaders
have
even
expressed
interest
in
keeping
some
production
curbs
in
place
through
though
suhail
mohamed
al
mazrouei
the
united
arab
emirates
oil
minister
said
opec
has
not
at
this
stage
discussed
extending
cuts
into
next
year
kachikwu
said
that
the
rapid
growth
in
shale
supply
is
not
just
a
problem
for
opec
it
s
a
problem
for
the
entire
oil
i
don
t
think
it
requires
pressure
i
think
the
oil
companies
would
be
the
first
to
tell
you
that
stability
in
the
oil
price
is
important
to
them
he
said
oil
majors
however
can
not
engage
in
supply
restrictions
to
affect
the
price
as
the
opec
cartel
does
and
some
ministers
on
monday
played
down
the
idea
that
the
growth
of
shale
could
not
be
handled
ecuador
s
oil
minister
carlos
perez
noted
that
shale
fields
tend
to
have
lower
total
oil
recovery
than
conventional
fields
it
has
an
impact
but
not
the
impact
we
expected
recovery
factors
are
still
low
so
right
now
there
is
no
additional
impact
