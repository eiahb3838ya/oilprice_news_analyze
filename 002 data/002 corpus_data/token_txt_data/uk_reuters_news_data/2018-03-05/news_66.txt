russia's rosneft holds key to fixing iraqi kurdistan oil flows - sources
erbil
reuters
russian
state
oil
company
rosneft
has
emerged
with
an
important
role
in
talks
between
iraq
s
government
and
iraqi
kurdistan
on
resuming
full
oil
exports
from
the
region
two
industry
sources
said
the
central
government
took
charge
of
half
of
the
oil
fields
that
were
under
iraqi
kurdistan
s
control
last
october
soon
after
the
northern
region
voted
for
independence
in
a
referendum
opposed
by
baghdad
exports
via
turkey
were
halved
prime
minister
haider
said
on
that
an
agreement
had
been
reached
at
talks
with
the
kurdistan
regional
government
krg
based
in
the
city
of
erbil
for
full
oil
exports
to
resume
soon
but
he
gave
no
more
detail
of
when
exports
would
resume
and
said
some
differences
would
have
to
be
resolved
later
the
two
sides
are
at
odds
over
payment
of
iraqi
kurdistan
s
debts
and
the
transfer
of
funds
to
the
region
from
the
national
budget
the
two
industry
sources
who
are
involved
in
the
talks
said
the
krg
has
told
baghdad
it
is
ready
to
resume
full
exports
and
transfer
the
funds
raised
to
the
iraqi
government
on
two
conditions
that
some
oil
is
kept
for
local
refining
and
baghdad
pays
pumping
tariffs
to
rosneft
the
russian
oil
major
took
over
ownership
of
the
region
s
export
oil
and
gas
pipelines
last
year
and
agreed
to
provide
it
with
over
billion
in
loans
but
the
deal
is
not
recognised
by
baghdad
which
says
independent
kurdish
oil
exports
are
illegal
erbil
offered
a
solution
and
has
written
to
baghdad
but
has
yet
to
hear
a
final
answer
one
of
the
sources
said
requesting
anonymity
because
the
talks
are
not
public
in
the
long
run
we
need
to
agree
on
budget
transfers
and
debts
to
find
a
compromise
over
exports
the
source
added
rosneft
declined
to
comment
moscow
did
not
oppose
the
referendum
which
the
united
sates
and
the
european
union
urged
the
krg
to
postpone
rosneft
s
role
in
the
talks
underlines
its
growing
international
clout
under
chief
executive
igor
sechin
an
ally
of
president
vladimir
putin
despite
western
sanctions
on
russia
over
its
role
in
the
ukraine
conflict
rosneft
s
role
was
discussed
by
one
of
the
company
s
vice
presidents
didier
casimiro
during
a
visit
to
baghdad
in
february
and
by
iraqi
foreign
minister
ibrahim
in
talks
in
moscow
last
month
the
industry
sources
said
jafari
said
iraq
was
not
closing
the
door
on
any
foreign
oil
company
and
iraq
s
oil
minister
has
said
baghdad
has
no
problem
with
rosneft
operating
in
the
kurdistan
region
krg
spokesman
safeen
dizayee
said
no
concrete
agreement
was
in
place
yet
but
he
was
hopeful
baghdad
would
agree
to
the
plan
which
included
proposals
on
rosneft
and
local
refining
he
declined
further
comment
sources
in
iraqi
kurdistan
say
baghdad
s
takeover
of
half
the
oilfields
near
the
kirkuk
area
had
cost
the
region
nearly
billion
in
lost
revenues
the
krg
also
says
baghdad
owes
it
billions
of
dollars
in
unpaid
transfers
from
the
state
budget
since
the
fall
of
dictator
saddam
hussein
in
kurdistan
has
traditionally
been
allocated
percent
of
the
federal
budget
after
sovereign
expenses
but
the
regional
government
says
it
has
not
been
receiving
that
amount
the
federal
government
says
it
stopped
the
transfer
of
funds
after
iraqi
kurdistan
began
independent
oil
exports
which
baghdad
says
are
illegal
the
dispute
has
been
complicated
by
the
budget
approved
by
the
national
parliament
on
saturday
in
a
vote
boycotted
by
kurdish
parties
iraqi
kurdistan
s
will
now
receive
a
budget
allocation
after
sovereign
expenses
which
reflects
its
share
of
the
iraqi
population
which
abadi
says
is
percent
industry
and
political
sources
in
baghdad
and
erbil
said
differences
were
still
too
big
to
reach
a
lasting
deal
on
oil
exports
before
iraq
holds
a
parliamentary
election
on
may
erbil
will
not
commit
to
a
deal
with
abadi
until
he
gets
and
abadi
doesn
t
seem
to
be
willing
to
commit
to
a
deal
that
could
weaken
his
position
before
the
election
a
source
involved
in
talks
in
erbil
told
reuters
an
ally
of
abadi
who
is
taking
part
in
the
talks
said
both
sides
are
betting
on
time
we
are
in
election
season
and
faces
might
change
but
any
delay
in
solving
the
kurdistan
problem
is
not
helpful
to
either
debts
have
piled
up
over
the
years
as
the
iraqi
kurds
borrowed
money
from
turkey
trading
houses
such
as
glencore
and
vitol
and
rosneft
to
pay
state
salaries
and
develop
the
infrastructure
of
its
pipelines
and
oilfields
baghdad
says
only
somo
has
the
right
to
export
iraqi
crude
this
is
a
massive
problem
their
the
kurds
view
is
if
they
are
to
hand
over
exports
to
somo
then
the
iraqi
government
should
take
on
that
debt
said
the
baghdad
negotiator
baghdad
will
pay
salaries
for
oil
but
will
not
take
on
the
krg
s
before
the
independence
referendum
last
september
iraqi
kurdistan
was
hoping
to
raise
oil
exports
above
million
barrels
per
day
from
around
bpd
becoming
one
of
the
world
s
fastest
growing
oil
regions
but
after
iraqi
troops
took
control
of
the
kirkuk
oil
fields
with
the
help
of
militias
krg
s
exports
have
been
running
at
around
bpd
another
bpd
worth
million
a
day
at
current
prices
are
trapped
under
the
ground
