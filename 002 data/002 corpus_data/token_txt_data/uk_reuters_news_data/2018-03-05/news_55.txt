eu legal blow to bid to regulate russia's nord stream 2 pipeline
brussels
reuters
an
eu
legal
opinion
has
rejected
a
european
commission
proposal
to
extend
the
bloc
s
internal
energy
market
rules
to
regulate
russia
s
planned
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
to
germany
the
opinion
is
a
blow
to
the
eu
executive
s
push
to
stall
russia
s
plan
to
double
the
gas
it
could
pump
under
the
baltic
sea
to
germany
bypassing
traditional
routes
via
ukraine
the
commission
fears
the
pipeline
would
undercut
efforts
to
reduce
dependence
on
moscow
and
its
support
for
kiev
the
opinion
seen
by
reuters
from
the
legal
service
of
the
council
of
the
european
union
the
body
where
eu
ministers
meet
said
applying
eu
rules
to
offshore
pipelines
may
breach
law
regulating
the
seas
the
commission
last
year
proposed
the
changes
to
its
gas
directive
to
make
all
import
pipelines
subject
to
rules
that
require
they
not
be
owned
directly
by
gas
suppliers
apply
tariffs
and
make
capacity
available
to
third
parties
the
nord
stream
project
fully
owned
by
russia
s
gas
export
monopoly
gazprom
is
far
from
complying
with
the
third
energy
package
rules
the
opinion
dated
march
said
the
commission
s
proposal
lacks
any
reasoning
on
the
regulatory
power
of
the
union
over
offshore
pipelines
crossing
an
eu
nation
s
exclusive
economic
zone
eez
the
union
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
apply
energy
law
which
is
unrelated
to
the
economic
exploitation
of
the
eez
to
pipelines
crossing
the
eez
of
member
states
the
council
s
legal
service
said
doing
so
would
run
counter
to
the
united
nations
convention
on
the
law
of
the
sea
as
interpreted
by
the
european
court
of
justice
the
document
says
adding
that
additional
analysis
is
needed
on
the
matter
the
commission
s
moves
to
regulate
nord
stream
including
by
seeking
a
mandate
from
member
states
to
negotiate
directly
with
the
russian
government
challenges
big
member
states
who
have
companies
invested
in
the
