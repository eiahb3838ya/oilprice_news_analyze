an
alliance
of
japanese
firms
including
automakers
and
energy
firms
has
pledged
to
build
fuelling
stations
for
hydrogen
fuel
cell
vehicles
by
to
help
accelerate

and
jxtg
nippon
oil
energy
said
on
monday
it
would
oversee
the
construction
and
operation
of
the
new
fuelling
stations
nearly
doubling
the
number
at
present
as
countries
seek
low
emissions
energy
sources
to
power
vehicles
homes
and
industry
japan
is
betting
heavily
on
becoming
a
hydrogen
society
despite
the
high
costs
and
technical
difficulties
of
a
process
that
creates
electricity
from
a
chemical
reaction
of
fuel
and
oxygen
jxtg
nippon
oil
senior
vice
president
yutaka
kuwahara
said
on
monday
that
a
lack
of
users
and
high
costs
to
build
and
operate
fuelling
stations
had
slowed
construction
in
japan
delaying
a
government
target
to
build
stations
by
march
japan
currently
has
about
stations
with
at
least
operated
by
jxtg
nippon
oil
and
another
are
in
the
planning
or
construction
stage
we
must
lower
costs
which
will
remove
many
of
the
bottlenecks
to
developing
more
stations
he
told
reporters
at
a
briefing
by
about
the
japanese
government
aims
to
roughly
halve
the
cost
of
building
a
hydrogen
fuelling
station
which
is
currently
about
million
yen
to
million
yen
million
well
above
million
yen
for
a
gasoline
station
the
path
to
adopting
hydrogen
has
been
dogged
by
the
difficulty
in
driving
widespread
given
high
costs
of
vehicles
fcvs
limited
production
capabilities
and
low
numbers
of
fuelling
stations
only
a
handful
of
automakers
currently
market
fcvs
including
toyota
honda
motor
co
and
hyundai
motor
co
toyota
has
sold
only
units
of
its
mirai
fcv
since
its
launch
in
while
it
has
sold
a
total
of
around
million
gasoline
hybrids
since
launching
the
prius
years
ago
japan
wants
to
have
hydrogen
stations
and
fcvs
on
the
country
s
roads
by
march
by
it
aims
to
have
stations
to
service
some
fcvs
buses
and
forklifts
by
then
it
expects
the
price
of
hydrogen
to
fall
to
around
yen
per
