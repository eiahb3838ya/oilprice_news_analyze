is
monitoring

compliance
with
curbs
on
its
disputed
nuclear
activity
imposed
by

has
long
called
the

a
net
gain
for

verification
since
it
has
provided
the
iaea
with
more
thorough
oversight
of
iran
but
in
a
speech
on

to
a
quarterly
meeting
of
the

diplomats
say
remains
a
distant
prospect
it
formally
notified
the

of
that
intention
in
january
in
what
was
widely
seen
as
a
diplomatic
warning
shot
aimed
at
the
trump
administration
which
reversed
a
policy
of
detente
with
iran
introduced
by
his
predecessor
barack
obama
but
the
move
prompted
the
iaea
to
ask
what
exactly
iran

plans
are
france
s
foreign

visited
iran
on
monday
on
a
delicate
mission
to
affirm
european
support
for
the
nuclear
deal
that
opened
up
iran
s
economy
while
echoing
concern
about
tehran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
and
role
in
middle
east
conflicts
