asia's strong jet fuel margins at risk from high cost to airlines
singapore

reuters
asian
airlines
may
have
to
raise
airfares
to
mitigate
costs
from
high
jet
fuel
prices
analysts
said
a
move
that
would
likely
cap
booming
growth
in
aviation
demand
and
slash
jet
fuel
margins
that
are
seasonally
at
their
strongest
in
five
years
the
profit
margins
refiners
make
from
producing
jet
fuel
are
currently
at
their
strongest
for
this
time
of
year
since
thanks
to
an
aviation
sector
that
has
surged
with
regional
economic
growth
cheap
fares
and
increased
route
options
but
aviation
fuel
prices
one
of
the
main
input
costs
for
airlines
are
also
lingering
close
to
their
highest
in
about
four
years
weighing
on
airlines
balance
sheets
asian
jet
cracks
are
currently
around
a
barrel
over
dubai
crude
while
jet
prices
are
close
to
their
highest
levels
since
december
if
jet
fuel
prices
get
too
high
then
airlines
will
have
to
start
revising
their
air
fares
up
said
a
middle
distillates
trader
adding
that
higher
ticket
prices
could
result
in
a
fall
in
passenger
miles
data
from
the
international
air
transport
association
iata
released
last
week
showed
a
slowdown
in
airlines
traffic
in
july
up
percent
over
the
same
month
last
year
as
against
a
growth
of
percent
in
june
rising
costs
particularly
fuel
will
likely
limit
the
stimulus
we
would
expect
from
lower
airfares
therefore
we
do
expect
to
see
a
continued
slowing
of
growth

iata
chief
executive
alexandre
de
juniac
in
a
statement
airlines
such
as
air
india
and
china
southern
airlines
in
major
asian
travel
hubs
are
struggling
to
remain
profitable
as
higher
fuel
costs
are
partly
offsetting
the
benefits
of
strong
travel
demand
indian
airlines
alone
are
expected
to
post
combined
losses
of
up
to
billion
this
financial
year
due
to
rising
costs
and
low
air
fares

the
likelihood
of

during

the

the

jet

asian
refiners

been
steadily
increasing
their

although
some
seasonal

are

overall

should
stay

not

we
are
also
entering
