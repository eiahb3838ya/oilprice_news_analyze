german court mulls bans of older diesel cars in frankfurt
wiesbaden
germany
sept
reuters
a
german
judge
is
due
to
decide
whether
the
city
of
frankfurt
the
country
s
financial
centre
should
ban
diesel
vehicles
as
a
way
to
improve
inner
city
air
quality
the
court
in
wiesbaden
is
on
wednesday
deliberating
on
a
case
brought
by
environmental
group
deutsche
umwelthilfe
duh
after
a
landmark
ruling
by
germany
top
administrative
court
in
february
opened
the
door
to
bans
the
latest
diesel
vehicles
manufactured
in
germany
will
meet
new
emissions
standards
but
the
majority
of
diesel
cars
on
german
roads
are
older
duh
has
argued
that
banning
diesels
is
the
only
way
for
frankfurt
to
meet
european
union
clean
air
rules
which
stipulate
that
nitrogen
dioxide
pollution
should
not
exceed
micrograms
per
cubic
meter
of
air
on
average
presiding
judge
rolf
hartmann
did
not
rule
out
diesel
bans
in
his
opening
remarks
on
wednesday
we
need
to
understand
that
this
is
about
a
threat
to
our
health
hartmann
said
adding
that
this
was
not
merely
a
niche
matter
for
environmentalists
to
deal
with
pollution
levels
have
regularly
exceeded
the
limit
since
the
court
heard
the
judge
could
say
as
soon
as
wednesday
whether
bans
are
a
viable
and
probable
solution
to
clean
up
frankfurt
s
air
the
city
of
hamburg
this
year
blocked
diesel
models
that
fail
to
meet
the
latest
emissions
standards
from
using
selected
trunk
roads
other
cities
including
aachen
duesseldorf
and
stuttgart
home
to
daimler
and
porsche
are
also
considering
bans
a
ban
on
diesel
vehicles
would
lead
to
higher
sales
of
petrol
engined
cars
which
are
less
fuel
efficient
and
cause
more
carbon
dioxide
pollution
this
in
turn
makes
it
harder
for
carmakers
to
cut
emissions
of
greenhouse
gases
adding
pressure
on
them
to
push
electric
or
hybrid
vehicles
at
a
time
when
mercedes
bmw
and
audi
are
readying
launches
of
electric
cars
