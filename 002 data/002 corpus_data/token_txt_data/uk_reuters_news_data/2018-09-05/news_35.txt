is
seeking
to
end
mexico
s
massive

nearly
all

himself
has
mostly
spoken
in
general
terms
and
had
not
previously
provided
numbers
it
will
be
a
refinery
that

mexico

is
the
salina
cruz
owned
and
operated
by
oil
company
pemex
in
the
southern
state
of
oaxaca
it
was
not
clear
if
lopez
obrador
was
referring
to
the
planned
refinery
s
crude
processing
capacity
or
its
gasoline
production
two
aides
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
salina
cruz
like
pemex
s
other
five
refineries
has
recently
been
producing
far
below
capacity
due
to
accidents
and
operational
problems
as
well
as
pemex
s
focus
on
maximizing
the
value
of
its
oil
even
if
that
means
refining
less
domestically
mexico
s
refining
network
can
process
up
to
million
bpd
of
crude
it
has
been
working
this
year
at
around
percent
