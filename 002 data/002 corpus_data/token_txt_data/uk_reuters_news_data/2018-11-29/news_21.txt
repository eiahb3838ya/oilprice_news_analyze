when
the

mine
one
of
the
oldest
coal
mines
in
poland
closed
in
march
grzegorz
chudy
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
neighborhood
was
vibrant
with
trees
in
the
full
bloom
of
spring
the
smell
was
heady
it
was
incredible
you
never
knew
all
those
trees
were
there
he
told
reuters
in
his
art
studio
in
a
housing
estate
for
mining
families
in
the
southwestern
polish
city
of
katowice
the
smell
wasn
t
there
while
coal
was
being
transported
on
trucks
the
dust
covered
it
the
wieczorek
mine
in
katowice
with
its
towering
brick
shaft
is
among
dozens
closing
down
throughout
poland
home
to
one
of
the
most
polluted
coal
mining
regions
in

from
sunday
katowice
will
host
a
round
of
united
nations
climate
talks
at
which
nearly
countries
will
attempt
to
agree
rules
on
how
to
shift
the
world
economy
from
fossil
fuels
to
try
to
curb
rising
temperatures
the
meeting
comes
as
the
world
meteorological
organization
warned
on
thursday
that
global
temperatures
were
on
course
to
rise
by
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
this
century
overshooting
a
global
target
of
limiting
the
increase
to
reaching
agreement
on
how
to
implement
ambitious
fossil
fuel
cuts
at
the
talks
could
be
tough
given
fears
over
the
impact
on
industry
which
have
divided
the
european
union
and
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
china
poland
has
painful
experience
of
the
difficulty
of
an
economic
transition
from
coal
and
even
as
it
counts
down
to
sunday
it
announced
plans
for
a
new
coal
mine
in
the
south
of
the
country
its
government
drew
support
in
part
from
those
with
an
emotional
attachment
to
the
job
security
social
fabric
and
national
pride
associated
with
mining
that
overlooked
the
downside
for
health
and
the
planet
the
issue
resonates
especially
with
older
poles
who
remember
deadly
protests
in
the
early
when
the
miners
emerged
as
heroes
chudy
whose
paintings
often
depict
the
life
and
architecture
of
nikiszowiec
is
one
of
hundreds
of
people
who
have
moved
to
the
area
drawn
by
its
industrial
feel
and
affordable
housing
built
to
house
the
families
of
miners
at
the
start
of
the
century
nikiszowiec
was
designed
as
a
neighborhood
with
its
own
communal
bread
ovens
and
pigsties
as
well
as
a
bath
house
for
miners
and
laundry
and
mangle
facilities
in
the
years
after
communist
rule
ended
in
poland
in
and
the
mining
sector
started
to
shrink
the
area
became
notorious
for
crime
and
poverty
such
problems
have
all
but
disappeared
as
the
area
has
become
gentrified
and
the
bold
decision
to
hold
the
climate
talks
in
the
region
could
also
help
to
shift
opinions
those
in
the
artistic
community
say
their
work
could
only
exist
with
the
inspiration
provided
by
decades
of
mining
for
me
using
coal
in
a
different
way
than
it
used
to
be
which
was
energy
shows
its
completely
new
face
so
we
can
call
it
our
new
cool
black
gold
katarzyna
depa
who
makes
jewelry
from
coal
said
but
for
those
with
mining
in
the
blood
moving
on
is
harder
and
the
smell
of
coal
dust
is
as
sweet
as
blossom
above
all
they
miss
the
community
spirit
even
if
it
meant
shared
danger
and
hardship
the
atmosphere
used
to
be
much
better
