for
while
keeping
steady
the
requirement
for
conventional
biofuels
like

according

an

the
mandate
includes

for
advanced
biofuels
that
can

an
increase
from
the
epa
s
initial
proposal
in

of
billion

above
the
billion
that
had
been
set
for
according

the
document
the
requirement
for

for
on

refiners
are
required
to
blend
a
certain
amount
of
biofuels
as
determined
by
the
epa
into
their

each

the
policy

helped
farmers
by
creating
a
huge
market
for
ethanol
and
other
biofuels
but
oil
refiners
say
compliance
can
cost
a
fortune
the
new
figures
confirm
the
agency
has
declined
requests
by
the
corn
industry
to
reallocate
biofuel
blending
obligations
previously
waived
under
the
small
refinery
exemptions
program
which
has
been
expanded
dramatically
under
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
small
refineries
can
be
exempted
from
the
rfs
if
they
prove
that
complying
would
cause
them
financial
strain
the
powerful
corn
lobby
and
top
officials
in
the
department
of
agriculture
have
complained
for
months
that
the
expansion
of
the
waiver
program
since
trump
took
office
threatens
demand
for
ethanol
an
epa
official
told
reuters
earlier
this
week
that
the
decision
not
to
reallocate
waived
volumes
was
due
mainly
to
timing
the
primary
reason
why
we
re
not
reallocating
in
this
rule
is
because
we
have
no
idea
what
the
volume
of
sres
small
refinery
exemptions
will
be
for
calendar
and
we
won
t
know
that
late
early
the
official
said
the
trump
administration
has
also
temporarily
put
on
hold
processing
of
current
waiver
applications
as
the
epa
and
the
department
of
energy
review
the
scoring
system
used
to
evaluate
them
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
the
epa
is
still
expected
to
rule
on
current
applications
before
the
march
compliance
deadline
for
the
calendar
year
in
an
interview
with
reuters
bill
wehrum
assistant
administrator
at
the
epa
s
air
and
radiation
department
said
most
applications
have
not
yet
been
received
for
calendar
year
i
think
we
are
only
now
starting
to
get
applications
and
the
bulk
of
them
we
are
not
going
to
see
until
probably
early
next
year
he
said
but
declined
to
comment
on
any
expected
change
in
the
number
of
waivers
granted
i
am
not
going
to
predict
what
we
may
or
may
not
do
he
said
each
waiver
decision
is
based
on
an
individual
application
filed
by
an
affected
biofuels
industry
participants
repeated
calls
on
the
epa
to
not
grant
too
many
waivers
without
a
check
on
abusive
epa
waivers
we
ll
continue
to
see
plants
closing
their
doors
or
idling
production
brooke
coleman
executive
director
at
the
advanced
biofuels
business
council
said
trump
has
sought
to
please
the
corn
lobby
with
a
different
tweak
to
biofuel
policy
in
october
he
directed
the
epa
to
draft
a
rule
allowing
sales
of
higher
ethanol
gasoline
blends
called
a
product
restricted
during
the
summer
over
concerns
it
contributes
to
smog
wehrum
said
the
agency
was
on
track
to
finalize
the
rule
before
june
in
time
for
the
driving
season
we
will
get
it
done
by
then
he
said
i
think
there
s
a
virtual
certainty
that
we
re
going
to
get
challenged
in
court
i
think
we
gave

good
