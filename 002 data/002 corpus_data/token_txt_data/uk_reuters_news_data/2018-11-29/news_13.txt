that
i
think
china
wants

the

has
levied
additional
duties
of
between
percent
and
percent
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
this
year
as
punishment
for
what
it
calls
china
s
unfair
trade
practices
with
the
percent
tariffs
set
to
climb
to
percent
next
year
a
reuters
poll
on
wednesday
showed
china
s
factories
likely
struggled
to
grow
for
a
second
straight
month
in
november
as
cooling
demand
at
home
and
the
threat
of
higher
tariffs
stifled
new
orders

side
has
repeatedly
stressed
that
the

trade
cooperation
is
about
mutual
benefit

trump
said
billions
of
dollars
are
pouring
into
the
coffers
of
the
because
of
the
tariffs
being
charged
to
china
and

is
a
long

to
go
if

t
want
to
pay
tariffs
