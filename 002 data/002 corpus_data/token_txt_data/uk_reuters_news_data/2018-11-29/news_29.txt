the
crude
oil
market
is
likely
to
be
fixated
in
coming
days
on
the
interactions
of
president
donald
trump
his
russian
counterpart
vladimir
putin
and
saudi
arabia
s
embattled
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
at
this
weekend
s
meeting
throw
in
a
dash
of
trade
politics
at
a
much
anticipated
dinner
on
saturday
between
trump
and
president
xi
jingping
and
the
gathering
in
buenos
aires
is
potentially
going
to
deliver
a
smorgasbord
of
juicy
headlines
to
drive
crude
prices
while
the
focus
of
crude
oil
market
participants
is
correct
and
indeed
they
have
little
choice
but
to
focus
on
the
machinations
of
trump
putin
and
bin
salman
there
is
always
a
risk
of
placing
too
much
emphasis
on
the
politics
of
oil
the
meeting
may
do
nothing
more
than
to
confirm
what
is
already
widely
known
namely
that
trump
wants
oil
prices
at
least
as
low
as
they
currently
are
and
that
putin
and
bin
salman
want
them
higher
but
not
so
high
as
to
risk
a
continual
blast
of
twitter
sprays
from
the
mercurial
leader
it
would
take
a
major
surprise
from
the
summit
to
alter
the
market
view
that
crude
is
currently
oversupplied
and
that
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
its
allies
including
russia
are
planning
on
reducing
output
at
their
meeting
in
the
meantime
there
are
other
developments
in
the
market
that
may
not
be
as
such
as
the
dynamics
of
china
the
world
s
largest
crude
importer
china
s
crude
imports
are
on
track
to
post
a
second
straight
monthly
record
with
and
port
data
compiled
by
refinitiv
pointing
to
imports
totalling
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
this
would
be
up
from
the
million
bpd
reported
by
customs
in
october
which
was
the
highest
on
record
exceeding
the
million
bpd
in
april
the
customs
numbers
and
the
data
don
t
exactly
match
given
slight
differences
in
when
cargoes
are
counted
as
having
arrived
and
been
cleared
however
even
if
the
november
estimate
is
on
the
optimistic
side
it
s
still
possible
that
china
s
crude
imports
will
exceed
million
bpd
in
a
month
for
the
first
time
ever
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
the
november
imports
likely
don
t
reflect
the
full
impact
of
brent
crude
s
recent
percent
plunge
from
a
close
of
a
barrel
on
to
on
wednesday
many
of
the
cargoes
that
have
arrived
in
november
would
have
been
arranged
and
paid
for
when
crude
oil
prices
were
near
their
recent
peak
this
raises
the
possibility
that
china
will
import
more
crude
in
coming
months
especially
if
the
authorities
in
beijing
and
the
oil
majors
decide
to
use
the
current
weakness
in
prices
to
speed
up
the
filling
of
the
strategic
reserve
china
doesn
t
release
regular
updates
on
the
status
of
its
strategic
stockpiles
but
most
market
estimates
are
that
it
is
only
about
half
way
to
meeting
the
target
of
days
of
import
cover
imports
for
storage
are
an
underlying
bullish
indicator
for
china
s
crude
demand
but
they
aren
t
the
only
factor
worth
following
the
rise
of
independent
refiners
since
when
they
were
first
granted
quotas
to
import
crude
has
also
been
a
positive
over
the
longer
term
but
also
leads
to
volatility
the
smaller
refiners
are
believed
to
have
been
active
in
the
market
in
recent
months
as
they
attempt
to
fill
their
import
quotas
prior
to
the
end
of
the
year
this
may
result
in
a
bringing
forward
of
some
demand
meaning
the
independents
may
buy
less
in
the
early
months
of
the
new
year
there
is
also
uncertainty
surrounding
iran
with
refinitiv
reporting
that
its
estimate
of
november
arrivals
includes
four
iranian
tankers
holding
about
million
barrels
that
have
been
floating
off
china
s
dalian
port
since
the
beginning
of
this
month
there
may
be
some
temptation
on
the
part
of
chinese
refiners
to
buy
iranian
crude
while
they
still
can
given
the
waiver
granted
by
the
united
states
to
china
and
seven
other
iranian
customers
will
expire
around
april
next
year
what
is
certain
is
that
china
isn
t
buying
any
cargoes
from
the
united
states
even
though
crude
isn
t
yet
subject
to
any
tariffs
as
part
of
the
trade
dispute
between
washington
and
beijing
unlike
coal
and
liquefied
natural
gas
no
tankers
have
been
assessed
by
refinitiv
as
having
been
discharged
in
china
since
september
with
refiners
cargoes
to
india
and
taiwan
what
is
clear
is
that
even
a
brief
look
at
the
current
dynamics
of
china
s
crude
imports
shows
there
is
considerably
more
to
the
market
than
merely
the
focus
on
the
likely
news

the
