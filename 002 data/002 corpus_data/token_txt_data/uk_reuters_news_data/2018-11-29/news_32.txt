exclusive-russia accepts need for oil cuts, bargains with saudi on details - sources
reuters
russia
is
becoming
increasingly
convinced
it
needs
to
reduce
oil
output
in
tandem
with
opec
but
is
still
bargaining
with
the
producer
group
s
leader
saudi
arabia
over
the
timing
and
volume
of
any
reduction
two
industry
sources
told
reuters
the
russian
energy
ministry
held
a
meeting
with
the
heads
of
domestic
oil
producers
on
tuesday
ahead
of
a
gathering
in
vienna
of
the
organisation
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
allies
on
the
idea
at
the
meeting
was
that
russia
needs
to
reduce
the
key
question
is
how
quickly
and
by
how
much
said
one
source
familiar
with
the
talks
between
russian
oil
firms
and
the
ministry
most
people
agreed
that
we
can
not
reduce
immediately
it
needs
to
be
a
gradual
process
like
last
time
said
the
source
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
as
he
is
forbidden
from
speaking
to
the
media
the
energy
ministry
declined
to
comment
russian
oil
companies
rosneft
and
gazprom
neft
declined
to
comment
lukoil
tatneft
surgutneftegas
gazprom
and
novatek
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
opec
and
its
allies
led
by
russia
have
been
restraining
production
under
a
pact
reached
in
late
to
prop
up
oil
prices
moscow
agreed
to
curb
output
by
barrels
per
day
or
one
sixth
of
the
overall
cut
of
million
bpd
but
russian
companies
took
several
months
to
reach
that
level
of
reduction
now
riyadh
has
suggested
opec
and
its
allies
reduce
output
by
million
bpd
from
january
to
arrest
a
price
decline
as
brent
crude
fell
below
a
barrel
this
week
from
as
high
as
in
october
due
to
concerns
about
a
possible
glut
if
russia
bore
the
same
proportion
of
such
cuts
as
it
did
under
the
existing
agreement
its
share
of
the
reduction
would
amount
to
bpd
it
was
also
said
that
reducing
by
one
sixth
this
time
is
a
big
ask
the
source
said
a
second
source
briefed
on
the
discussions
said
we
need
to
reduce
but
would
not
want
to
reduce
by
opec
and
its
allies
will
be
meeting
amid
concerns
over
a
slowing
global
economy
and
rising
oil
supplies
from
the
united
states
which
is
not
involved
in
the
existing
pact
saudi
arabia
is
coming
under
renewed
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
who
has
asked
the
kingdom
to
refrain
from
output
reductions
and
help
to
lower
oil
prices
further
possibly
complicating
any
decision
at
next
week
s
talks
is
the
crisis
around
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
last
month
trump
has
backed
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
despite
calls
from
many
politicians
to
impose
stiff
sanctions
on
riyadh
russian
president
vladimir
putin
will
meet
prince
mohammed
in
argentina
at
this
weekend
s
summit
which
trump
is
also
to
attend
moscow
has
so
far
not
committed
to
any
new
production
cuts
on
wednesday
putin
said
russia
was
in
touch
with
opec
but
moscow
would
be
satisfied
with
an
oil
price
of
a
barrel
putin
previously
said
russia
would
be
content
with
oil
at
we
are
in
contact
with
opec
and
we
are
ready
to
continue
our
joint
efforts
if
needed
putin
said
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
on
wednesday
the
kingdom
would
not
cut
oil
output
on
its
own
we
generally
have
our
reservations
about
the
likelihood
of
a
cooperation
this
time
around
though
the
russian
position
will
undoubtedly
be
crucial
