gains

investor
jitters
ahead
of
trade
talks
between

trump
and

chinese
counterpart
xi
jinping
on
saturday
on
the
sidelines
of
the
summit
in
argentina
economists
at
anz
pointed
out
that
policy
hawks
in
the
trump
administration
who
want
washington
to
take
a
tough
stance
against
beijing
appear
to
be
in
the
ascendancy
they
will
want
some
concessions
from
china
not
least
of
all
on
what
they
perceive
is
theft
of
intellectual
property
and
forced
technology
transfer
wrote
the
anz
economists
thus
it
would
seem
the
prospect
of
the
meeting
ending
without
a
sustainable
resolution
to
their
differences
is
relatively
analysts
believe
any
signs
of
a
thaw
in
tensions
could
trigger
a
rally
but
say
the
move
would
likely
be
short
lived
unless
there
are
substantive
concessions
most
notably
if
xi
can
persuade
trump
to
postpone
a
sharp
tariff
hike
on
chinese
goods
due
to
take
effect
the
dow
rallied
percent
and
nasdaq
surged
nearly

on
wednesday
as
powell
s
comments
eased
fears
of
a
faster
pace
of
rate
hikes
in
equities
gained
as
powell
hinted
of
implementing
fewer

hikes

said
masafumi

in

the
likelihood
of
slower
monetary
tightening
caused
the
dollar
to
slump
against
currencies
particularly
the
euro
which
could
soon
benefit
from
an
ecb
rate
the
euro
was
percent

advancing

the
previous

the

the
australian

sensitive

the

index
against

major

an
overnight
loss

the
treasury
yield
fell
to
percent
its
lowest
since
following
powell
s
comments
the
treasury
yield
was
down
for
the
third
straight

oil
prices
clawed
back
some
ground
from
losses
in
the
previous
session
but
an
increase
in
crude
inventories
and
uncertainty
in
the
run
to
an
opec
meeting
next
week
kept
markets
under
pressure
