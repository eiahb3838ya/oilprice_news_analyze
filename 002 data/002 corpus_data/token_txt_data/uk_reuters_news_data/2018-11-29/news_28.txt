on

down

after
trump
struck
an
uncompromising
tone
on

trump
said
on
thursday
there
was
a
long
way
to
go
on
tariffs
with
china
and
urged
companies
to
build
products
in
the
united
states
to
avoid
them
the
messaging
from
the
over
the
last
four
weeks
has
been
characteristically
erratic
said
david
page
senior
economist
at
axa
investment
managers
the
market
is
closely
watching
a
meeting
between
trump
and
chinese
leader
xi
jinping
at
the
summit
on
saturday
at
which
the
leaders
are
expected
to
discuss
trade
investors
say
a
sustained
market
rally
following
the
summit
would
hinge
on
there
being
substantive
concessions
from
trump
in
particular
whether
xi
can
persuade
trump
to
postpone
a
sharp
tariff
hike
on
chinese
goods
due
to
take
effect
if
trump
were
able
to
get
those
additional
concessions
from
china
at
this
meeting
and
announce
certainly
no
trade
deal
but
a
commitment
to
further
negotiations
to
work
towards
a
deal
and
in
the
interim
not
see
further
escalation
then
that
s
something
markets
would
latch
onto
page
added
stocks
had
enjoyed
a
strong
rally
on
wednesday
after
powell
said
interest
rates
were
just
below
neutral
less
than
two
months
after
saying
rates
were
probably
a
long
way
from
that
point
given
the
volatility
you
ve
seen
recently
it
s
probably
quite
reasonable
to
expect
a
little
bit
of
a
bounce
that
being
said
given
the
headwinds
out
there
i
can
t
see
it
being
sustained
