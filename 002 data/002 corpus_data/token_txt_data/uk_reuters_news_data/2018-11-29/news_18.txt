rpt-fractured france: diesel tax protests expose macron's achilles' heel
beauvais
france

hunched
over
a
burning
oil
drum
on
a
traffic
island
protesters
in
yellow
vests
line
up
to
decry
france
s
punishing
fuel
taxes
and
spiralling
living
costs
blaming
a
president
who
they
see
as
detached
from
the
everyday
struggles
of
life
outside
the
city
for
two
weeks
the
tax
protests
have
played
out
at
roadblocks
across
france
and
even
on
paris
s
champs
elysees
representing
one
of
the
biggest
and
challenges
to
emmanuel
macron
s
authority
since
his
election
last
year
the
unyielding
initial
response
from
the
president
a
former
investment
banker
has
only
reinforced
a
view
among
the
and
workers
that
he
is
part
of
an
urban
elite
contemptuous
of
their
world
nowhere
is
that
more
keenly
felt
than
in
small
villages
commuter
towns
and
city
outskirts
where
macron
s
move
to
scrap
a
wealth
tax
increase
a
social
welfare
levy
and
raise
fuel
duties
has
deepened
a
sense
of
marginalisation
in
france
there
s
always
existed
a
divide
between
the
big
cities
and
outlying
areas
but
these
days
the
gulf
is
growing
wider
and
wider
protester
stephan
hirelle
said
macron
s
election
win
upended
french
politics
bringing
to
office
a
political
outsider
who
promised
an
alienated
electorate
that
his
administration
would
reconnect
with
the
grassroots
create
jobs
and
revive
the
economy
a
year
and
a
half
on
it
is
a
similar
vein
of
anger
spurring
the
yellow
vests
a
spontaneous
protest
movement
that
caught
macron
and
could
spell
trouble
for
his
ambitions
in
next
year
s
european
elections
diesel
pump
prices
may
have
been
the
trigger
but
the
protests
in
which
adherents
don
the
jackets
all
french
motorists
must
carry
have
tapped
deeper
grievances
hirelle
and
his
comrades
who
count
among
them
a
truck
driver
pensioners
and
blue
collar
workers
bemoan
the
decline
of
french
industry
the
government
s
failure
to
protect
local
jobs
from
china
s
clout
and
what
they
see
as
the
selfish
interests
of
the
political
elite
similar
resentments
helped
propel
president
donald
trump
to
power
and
have
underpinned
populists
across
europe
the
unrest
has
pushed
macron
s
approval
ratings
to
record
lows
of
barely
percent
in
surveys
he
trails
leader
marine
le
pen
ahead
of
next
may
s
european
vote
there
s
a
total
disconnect
between
him
and
us
said
camus
as
trucks
and
passing
cars
blared
their
horns
in
support
what
he
says
counts
for
nothing
taxes
keep
going
up
essentially
it
s
a
declaration
of
camus
and
his
comrades
are
hunkered
down
on
a
traffic
island
sandwiched
between
a
motorway
toll
station
and
an
commercial
centre
that
sprawls
along
a
km
strip
on
the
outskirts
of
beauvais
a
town
km
miles
north
of
paris
that
is
a
base
for
airline
ryanair
in
a
scene
repeated
across
france
the
area
s
hypermarkets
and
restaurants
have
fuelled
the
demise
of
artisan
businesses
in
villages
that
abut
estates
public
transport
is
often
scant
the
car
is
king
and
costly
to
run
macron
has
long
struggled
to
shake
off
the
tag
of
president
of
the
rich
and
the
view
that
he
is
out
of
touch
he
has
successfully
stared
down
protests
over
reforms
to
the
labour
code
the
state
railways
and
pension
system
that
were
orchestrated
by
trade
unions
and
his
opponents
but
the
yellow
vest
rebellion
which
enjoys
broad
public
support
risks
being
far
more
dangerous
for
the
president
on
tuesday
he
sought
to
dampen
the
protesters
anger
offering
talks
between
his
government
and
their
representatives
the
next
round
of
fuel
tax
hikes
which
he
says
are
necessary
to
fight
climate
change
will
go
ahead
in
january
but
he
gave
himself
room
to
back
down
later
proposing
a
quarterly
review
of
pump
prices
to
ensure
the
tax
is
fair
i
hear
the
people
s
discontent
he
said
i
will
not
allow
our
energy
transition
plan
to
deepen
the
inequalities
between
regions
and
make
the
lives
of
citizens
in
rural
areas
and
areas
even
more
protesters
on
the
barricades

unimpressed
their
impression
of
macron
has
been
cemented
on
wednesday

as
