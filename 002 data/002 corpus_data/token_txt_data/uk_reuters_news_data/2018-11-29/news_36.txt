new ultralight material offers many uses for plastic waste, researchers say
singapore
reuters
researchers
in
singapore
are
seeking
a
patent
for
a
new
and
material
made
from
recycled
plastic
bottles
they
say
could
help
reduce
plastic
waste
dumped
in
oceans
and
clogging
landfills
the
national
university
of
singapore
team
said
it
had
found
a
way
to
convert
bottles
made
from
polyethylene
terephthalate
pet
into
aerogels
that
have
many
potential
uses
from
insulation
and
fire
safety
to
cleaning
up
oil
spills
plastic
waste
is
one
of
the
hardest
wastes
to
recycle

an
associate
professor
at
the
university
s
department
of
mechanical
engineering
told
reuters
television
the
team
had
been
looking
for
novel
engineering
applications
to
help
reduce
the
global
scourge
of
plastic
waste
he
said
some
eight
million
tonnes
of
plastic
is
dumped
into
oceans
every
year
killing
marine
life
and
entering
the
human
food
chain
according
to
the
environment
program
five
asian
countries
china
indonesia
the
philippines
vietnam
and
thailand
accounted
for
up
to
percent
of
plastic
waste
leaking
into
oceans
according
to
a
study
the
pet
aerogels
made
from
plastic
bottle
waste
are
soft
flexible
durable
very
light
and
easy
to
handle
the
team
said
in
a
statement
this
month
one
recycled
bottle
can
produce
an
aerogel
sheet
the
team
said
and
the
material
can
be
customized
for
various
uses
by
adding
surface
treatments
to
enhance
its
ability
to
absorb
and
insulate
for
example
a
sheet
coated
with
fire
retardant
chemicals
was
able
to
withstand
temperatures
of
up
to
degrees
celsius
that
is
seven
times
higher
than
a
regular
thermal
lining
in
a
firefighter
s
coat
and
only
percent
of
the
weight
versions
of
the
material
can
also
be
used
for
heat
and
sound
insulation
in
buildings
cleaning
oil
spills
and
in
masks
to
absorb
carbon
monoxide
the
team
published
its
research
in
the
scientific
journal
colloids
and
surfaces
a
in
august
it
filed
for
a
patent
in
march
and
is
looking
for
partners
to
mass
produce
the
aerogel
the
cost
of
making
a
meter
by
meter
by
cm
sheet
could
be
less
than
s
duong
said
as
countries
struggle
to
cope
with
growing
piles
of
plastic
and
other
waste
duong
said
their
invention
showed
that
engineering
and
technology
can
offer
solutions
in
the
future
my
dream
is
that
there
will
be
no
waste
for
me
to
recycle
