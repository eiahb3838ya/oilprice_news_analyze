wind
turbine
maker
vestas
sees
demand
peaking
in
as
government
incentives
which
have
spurred
investments
in
the
sector
are
phased
out
the
danish
company
is
the
turbine
maker
most
exposed
to
the
market
where
it
competes
with
general
electric
and
siemens
gamesa
strong
interest
from
utilities
looking
to
replace
retiring
coal
assets
and
big
companies
looking
to
buy
renewable
power
will
ensure
demand
does
not
fall
off
a
cliff
as
some
analysts
have
predicted
vestas

there
s
no
such
thing
as
a
cliff

i
think
that
is
going
to
be
the
peak
of
where
the
demand
is
and
you
re
going
to
see
it
fall
off
a
little
bit
as
you
lose
the
ptc
production
tax
credit
and
then
you
re
probably
going
to
see
it
come
back
he
later
told
reuters
the
ptc
scheme
has
been
critical
to
enabling
wind
projects
to
compete
with
fossil
fuel
plants
but
will
start
being
gradually
phased
out
from
brown
pointed
to
gigawatt
gw
of
unmet
demand
by
from
companies
which
is
an
alliance
of
firms
including
goldman
sachs
walmart
and
starbucks
that
aims
to
get
percent
of
electricity
from
renewable
sources
to
combat
climate
change
another
gw
of
unmet
demand
comes
from
utilities
across
the
united
states
looking
to
replace
coal
plants
with
new
wind
generation
