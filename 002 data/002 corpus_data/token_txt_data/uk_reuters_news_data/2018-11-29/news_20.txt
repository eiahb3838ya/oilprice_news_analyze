said
on

it
had
presented
options
on
a
new
generation
of
nuclear
reactors
to
the
french
government
and
talks
were
underway
but
dismissed
reports
in

that
it
had
taken
a

the
nikkei
business

reported
that
france
had
informed
japan
it
would
halt
research
into
the
astrid
advanced

no

from
a

nuclear
agency
said
one
option
it
had
discussed
was
to
reduce
astrid

to
a

yoshihide
suga
said
on

he
had
not
been
informed
about
any
french

that
nothing
has
been

decades
of

japan
pulled
the
plug
on
its
own

prototype
project
the
astrid
reactor
is
one
of
several
new
designs
that
could
succeed
the
pressurised
water
reactors
that
drive
most
of
the
world
nuclear
plants
instead
of
water
they
use
liquid
sodium
as
a
coolant
but
sodium
burns
on
contact
with
air
and
explodes
when
plunged
into
water
an
earlier
french
model
was
scrapped

encountering
major
technical
problems
russia
is
the
only
nation
to
have
working
breeder
reactors
which
can
burn
spent
uranium
fuel
plutonium
and
other
nuclear
waste
products
in
theory
breeders
could
turn
utility
edf
s
nuclear
waste
into
fuel
and
make
france

energy
for
decades
their
potential
is
part
of
the
reason
why
france
recycles
spent
fuel
from
edf
s
reactors
separating
out
plutonium
in

the

abandoning
of
