wants
to
temporarily
connect
an
existing
centimeter
pipe
to
the
parts
of
its
mariner
east
pipeline
that
it
has
already
completed
so
it
can
start
transporting
liquids
for
customers
those
customers
have
been
waiting
for
more
than
a
year
to
ship
liquids
on
mariner
east
when
energy
transfer
first
started
working
on
the
billion
project
in
february

had
planned
to
put
the
pipe
into
service
in
the
third
quarter
of
mariner
east
and
another
energy
transfer
project
the
rover
natural
gas
pipe
from
ohio
to
michigan
were
delayed
over
the
past
year
in
part
because
the
projects
together
racked
up
more
than
state
and
federal
permit
violations
while
the
company
raced
to
build
them
those
opposed
to
energy
transfer
s
plans
for
mariner
east
asked
the
pennsylvania
public
utility

puc
to
stop
construction
on

also
stop
the

at
the
puc

to
hear
the
case

a
case
earlier

ordered
energy
transfer
to
stop
transporting

in
the
latest
case
seven
residents

argued
energy

did
not
provide
adequate
notice
of
procedures
sufficient
to
ensure
the
safety
of
the
public
in
the
event
of
a
leak
or

an
email

do
not
believe
the
claim
is
valid

integrity
of
our
mariner

and
pipelines
has
been
verified
in
the
last
few
months

and
federal
regulators
