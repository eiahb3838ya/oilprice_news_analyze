britain
s
support
for
oil
and
gas
exploration
in
the
arctic
is
incompatible
with
its
international
climate
change
commitments
a
report
from
a
group
of
lawmakers
said
on
thursday
the
international
paris
agreement
set
a
goal
of
ending
the
fossil
fuel
era
in
the
second
half
of
this
century
in
an
effort
to
curb
rising
temperatures
which
if
left
unchecked
are
forecast
to
lead
to
heat
and
rising
sea
levels
britain
should
cease
encouraging
british
business
to
explore
oil
and
gas
opportunities
in
the
arctic
and
call
on
other
nations
to
adopt
a
similar
approach
the
report
by
the
environment
audit
committee
said
the
government
should
start
by
acknowledging
the
incompatibility
of
its
support
for
oil
and
gas
exploitation
with
its
climate
change
commitments
mary
creagh
chair
of
the
environment
audit
committee
said
in
a
statement
published
with
the
group
s
report
the
report
said
arctic
sea
ice
is
at
its
lowest
level
since
records
began
and
the
arctic
ocean
could
be
ice
free
in
the
summer
as
soon
as
the
report
called
on
the
government
to
provide
greater
funding
for
arctic
research
and
set
targets
to
protect
arctic
biodiversity
as
well
as
setting
a
timeline
to
reduce
the
country
s
plastic
pollution
it
also
said
the
government
should
press
the
international
maritime
organisation
to
ban
polluting
heavy
fuel
oils
as
soon
as
possible
and
to
designate
the
arctic
as
a
special
sensitive
area
many
oil
and
gas
companies
such
as
equinor
and
eni
operate
in
the
arctic
while
president
donald
trump
has
pushed
for
further
oil
and
gas
licenses
to
be
made
available
in
the
region
britain
s
foreign
and
commonwealth
office
fco
which
represents
britain
at
the
arctic
council
said
in
april
that
despite
moves
to
decarbonise
the
world
is
likely
to
rely
on
oil
and
gas
for
decades
to
come
supplying
this
demand
will
require
exploration
of
new
potential
resources
with
the
arctic
with
its
significant
hydrocarbon
reserves
potentially
playing
a
major
role
