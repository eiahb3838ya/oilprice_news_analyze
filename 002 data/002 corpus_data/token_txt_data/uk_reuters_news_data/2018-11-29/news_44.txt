india
s
adani
enterprises
will
fully
fund
its
coal
mine
and
rail
project
in
australia
itself
the
company
said
on
thursday
taking
a
big
step
closer
to
building
the
project
that
has
faced
fierce
resistance
from
green
groups
adani
mining
chief
executive
lucas
dow
announced
the
funding
milestone
for
the
carmichael
mine
in
a
speech
in
queensland
a
state
that
has
been
counting
on
the
project
to
create
jobs
he
did
not
comment
on
the
actual
cost
last
year
the
company
said
it
was
looking
to
borrow
under
a
billion
billion
to
get
the
a
billion
project
off
the
ground
targeting
its
first
exports
in
march
having
missed
many
deadlines
over
the
past
few
years
adani
also
declined
to
give
a
timeframe
on
thursday
for
beginning
construction
or
the
first
production
from
carmichael
adani
shrank
the
project
plans
early
last
year
to
make
it
more
affordable
after
running
into
problems
lining
up
financing
as
banks
backed
away
from
funding
new
coal
mines
under
pressure
from
investors
worried
about
climate
change
it
now
plans
to
start
by
producing
around
million
tonnes
a
year
for
the
company
s
own
use
eventually
ramping
up
to
million
tonnes
for
the
first
stage
of
the
project
a
mine
of
that
size
with
a
rail
spur
would
typically
take
around
two
years
to
build
initial
output
is
just
a
quarter
of
adani
s
original
plan
to
produce
as
much
as
million
tonnes
a
year
spending
a
billion
to
build
a
mine
along
with
rail
and
port
infrastructure
the
reduced
plan
only
requires
a
rail
spur
connecting
to
aurizon
holdings
rail
line
rather
than
a
whole
new
competing
line
and
no
port
expansion
which
helped
drive
down
the
cost
the
sharpening
of
the
mine
plan
has
kept
operating
costs
to
a
mininum
dow
said
in
his
speech
the
project
stacks
up
both
environmentally
and
financially
he
said
the
mine
has
battled
a
string
of
lawsuits
from
environmental
groups
who
argue
it
will
contribute
to
global
warming
and
damage
australia
s
great
barrier
reef
we
will
fight
this
to
the
end
this
is
not
a
done
deal

society
spokeswoman
imogen
zethoven
said
in
a
statement
saying
the
company
still
needed
some
final
approvals
adani
said
the
only
approvals
the
project
now
needs
are
standard
clearance
for

management
plans
australian
dollars
