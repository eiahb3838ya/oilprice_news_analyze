canada
s
alberta
province
is
in
talks
to
buy
rail
cars
to
transport
barrels
per
day
of
crude
oil
and
expects
a
deal
to
be
concluded
within
weeks
premier
rachel
notley
said
on
wednesday
as
the
province
tries
to
move
oil
stuck
in
the
region
because
of
a
lack
of
pipeline
capacity
notley
who
said
the
cars
were
needed
to
help
deal
with
a
glut
that
has
slashed
the
price
of
alberta
oil
told
a
business
audience
she
was
disappointed
the
federal
government
was
not
helping
fund
the
purchase
reuters
reported
last
week
that
alberta
had
proposed
a
joint
purchase
of
two
unit
trains
worth
of
capacity
and
estimated
the
capital
cost
at
about
c
million
million
pounds
federal
officials
are
cool
to
the
idea
saying
that
by
the
time
the
first
cars
come
on
line
late
next
year
the
supply
problems
will
have
eased
alberta
estimates
it
is
producing
about
bpd
more
than
can
be
shipped
using
existing
pipeline
and
rail
capacity
alberta
will
buy
the
rail
cars
ourselves
to
move
this
oil
notley
said
in
a
speech
we
have
already
engaged
a
third
party
to
negotiate
and
work
is
well
under
way
we
anticipate
conclusion
of
the
deal
within
she
later
told
reporters
a
deal
could
be
announced
before
year
end
based
on
the
initial
talks
alberta
expects
the
first
bpd
of
capacity
to
come
online
in
december
ramping
up
to
the
full
bpd
by
august
with
the
agreement
running
for
three
years
it
s
a
lot
of
trains
and
a
lot
of
cars
notley
told
maclean
s
magazine
in
a
webcast
interview
on
wednesday
evening
noting
it
took
multiple
unit
trains
to
move
the
equivalent
of
bpd
the
added
transport
capacity
is
expected
to
improve
the
canadian
crude
discount
by
about
over
the
term
the
provincial
government
said
under
that
time
line
the
first
rail
cars
would
roll
out
just
as
an
expansion
of
enbridge
inc
s
line
oil
export
pipeline
is
set
to
start
operation
although
notley
argued
the
rail
capacity
would
still
be
needed
line
only
clears
the
market
for
three
months
before
we
find
ourselves
back
in
this
situation
again
she
told
maclean
s
notley
said
the
cost
of
buying
the
cars
would
be
fully
recouped
through
royalties
and
the
selling
of
shipping
capacity
her
spokeswoman
cheryl
oates
said
the
province
did
not
anticipate
keeping
the
unit
trains
beyond
notley
said
there
was
no
excuse
for
ottawa
not
helping
and
castigated
the
federal
government
for
proposing
tougher
environmental
standards
that
she
said
would
make
it
harder
than
ever
to
build
pipelines
the
supply
glut
is
happening
because
canada
willfully
holds
alberta
s
economy
and
canada
s
economy
hostage
she
said
estimating
the
losses
at
c
million
a
day
ottawa
denies
it
is
being
unhelpful
noting
that
it
bought
kinder
morgan
canada
ltd
s
trans
mountain
pipeline
earlier
this
year
vanessa
adams
a
spokeswoman
for
federal
natural
resources
minister
amarjeet
sohi
said
ottawa
was
analyzing
alberta
s
proposal
about
splitting
the
cost
of
the
unit
trains
several
canadian
crude
producers
have
curtailed
production
and
asked
alberta
to
mandate
cuts
for
other
producers
oates
said
a
decision
on
that
would
be
made
within
a
week
oates
also
said
alberta
was
not
considering
a
royalty
holiday
to
incentivize
output
cuts
adding
a
number
of
tools
were
being
considered
including
the
way
royalties
were
applied
last
week
federal
finance
minister
bill
morneau
said
businesses
would
be
allowed
to
write
off
additional
capital
investments
something
that
he
said
oil
industry
executives
had
pressed
