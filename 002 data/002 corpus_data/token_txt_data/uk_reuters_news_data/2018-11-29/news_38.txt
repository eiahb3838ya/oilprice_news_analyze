global
temperatures
are
on
course
for
a
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
rise
this
century
far
overshooting
a
global
target
of
limiting
the
increase
to
or
less
the
world
meteorological
organisation
said
on
thursday
greenhouse
gas
concentrations
are
once
again
at
record
levels
and
if
the
current
trend
continues
we
may
see
temperature
increases
degrees

petteri
taalas
said
in
the
wmo
s
annual
statement
on
the
state
of
the
climate
if
we
exploit
all
known
fossil
fuel
resources
the
temperature
rise
will
be
considerably
scientists
say
that
it
is
vital
to
limit
the
rise
in
global
temperatures
to
celsius
to
avert
more
extreme
weather
rising
sea
levels
and
the
loss
of
plant
and
animal
species
although
limiting
the
rise
to
would
have
a
far
greater
benefit
at
the
paris
climate
conference
the
countries
of
the
world
pledged
to
work
to
limit
the
rise
to
a
step
that
will
require
a
radical
reduction
in
the
use
of
the
fossil
fuels
that
are
the
primary
cause
of
global
warming
on
sunday
the
most
important
climate
conference
since
paris
opens
in
katowice
poland
in
one
of
the
most
polluted
regions
in
europe
the
talks
are
intended
to
produce
a
rule
book
on
how
to
implement
the
paris
agreement
which
the
united
states
at
the
behest
of
president
donald
trump
has
announced
it
will
quit
success
according
to
the
conference
s
polish
host
will
need
a
miracle
taalas
said
that
the
lower
end
of
the
range
a
rise
in
temperatures
came
from
a
model
assuming
that
countries
acted
on
their
pledges
to
meet
the
paris
targets
if
all
the
countries
were
able
to
meet
their
pledges
we
would
be
able
to
reach
degrees
which
would
mean
a
growing
amount
of
disasters
and
difficulties
with
agriculture
he
said
but
he
added
that
the
economic
and
technological
means
already
existed
to
limit
the
rise
