for
half
the
year
the
temperature
on
pall
olafsson
s
remote
farm
in
iceland
often
dips
below
freezing
and
the
sun
barely
makes
an
appearance
yet
the
heat
and
light
in
his
greenhouses
allow
olafsson
to
grow
his
juicy
tomatoes
and
cucumbers
even
in
the
depths
of
winter
thanks
largely
to
the
geothermal
energy
that
gives
his
tiny
north
atlantic
nation
its
title
the
land
of
fire
and
ice
when
we
started
using
the
lights
and
growing
all
year
round
then
it
changed
a
lot
said
olafsson
as
workers
busily
pruned
plants
behind
him
before
you
were
picking
the
last
tomatoes
in
november
and
next
you
pick
in
april
maybe
years
ago
it
was
like
olafsson
credits
the
hot
springs
that
bubble
up
from
the
earth
a
short
distance
away
with
turning
hveravellir
into
one
of
iceland
s
biggest
vegetable
farms
producing
about
tonnes
of
tomatoes
cucumber
and
paprika
a
year
iceland
s
volcanic
origins
have
blessed
the
island
of
inhabitants
with
abundant
geothermal
energy
a
renewable
resource
that
unlike
solar
or
wind
power
is
unaffected
by
its
unpredictable
weather
geothermal
energy
makes
up
a
quarter
of
iceland
s
electricity
all
of
which
comes
from
renewable
sources
and
has
helped
boost
the
availability
of
fresh
food
in
the
past
two
decades
the
naturally
hot
water
is
piped
in
to
heat
the
greenhouses
and
the
hot
springs
are
also
a
key
source
power
for
the
artificial
lights
that
help
farmers
grow
their
crops
even
in
winter
when
the
island
sees
barely
three
hours
of
sunlight
icelandic
farmers
began
artificially
lighting
their
greenhouses
about
years
ago
but
the
real
was
the
technology
that
allows
them
to
control
every
detail
remotely
from
a
smartphone
said
knutur
rafn
armann
who
runs
the
fridheimer
tomato
farm
with
his
wife
helena
we
have
a
steering
computer
in
every
greenhouse
connected
to
our
weather
station
connected
to
our
model
pc
computer
which
is
connected
to
the
internet
he
said
so
whenever
i
go
somewhere
i
always
have
my
iphone
with
me
and
i
can
water
the
plants
open
windows
and
change
settings
or
steer
everything
through
my
the
remote
island
historically
imported
much
of
its
food
but
the
double
whammy
of
the
financial
crisis
and
a
volcanic
eruption
that
prevented
planes
from
landing
in
have
encouraged
greater
now
at
least
half
the
tomatoes
and
cucumbers
sold
here
are
locally
grown
said
gunnlaugur
karlsson
managing
director
of
solufelag
gardyrkjumanna
sfg
which
packages
and
markets
fruit
and
vegetables
he
believes
it
is
common
sense
for
a
remote
island
to
produce
as
much
of
its
own
food
as
possible
and
besides
local
produce
sells
this
year
sfg
began
working
with
farmers
to
take
their
food
into
kindergartens
ensuring
the
children
eat
produce
that
is
locally
grown
and
the
industry
is
doing
what
it
can
to
encourage
people
to
buy
local
but
many
believe
the
government
could
do
more
to
help
the
authorities
do
not
care
if
the
food
is
imported
or
locally
grown
as
long
as
it
is
not
contaminated
with
harmful
chemicals
etc
said
helgi
johannesson
a
farming
consultant
a
spokesman
for
iceland
s
ministry
of
industries
and
innovation
said
the
government
was
working
on
a
policy
to
procurement
local
food
for
government
institutions
however
farmers
say
the
government
could
achieve
more
by
giving
them
preferential
rates
for
electricity
currently
just
percent
of
iceland
s
total
power
goes
to
farmers
who
say
they
have
to
pay
a
higher
rate
than
the
aluminium
industry
the
power
provider
landsvirkjun
does
not
disclose
prices
and
the
icelandic
government
declined
to
comment
i
often
say
to
the
government
if
we
decide
to
use
percent
of
electricity
to
make
healthy
good
food
for
ourselves
that
would
be
great
said
tomato
farmer
armann
but
of
course
they
would
have
to
lower
the
prices
