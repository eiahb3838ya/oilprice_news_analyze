and
workers
at

s
largest
power
plant
maritsa

marched
in
sofia
on
thursday
to
protect
their
jobs
and
to
urge
the
government
to
support
energy
production
in
the
balkan
country
more
than
people
urged
the
government
to
guarantee
it
would
not
shut
mines
and
power
plants
at
maritsa
east
lignite
coal
complex
in
southern
bulgaria
despite
a
european
union
push
to
decarbonise
the
bloc
s
economy
by
it
looks
like
they
may
start
closing
units
one
by
one
because
of
the
convention
that
forces
us
to
cut
the
harmful
emissions
said
katia
vassileva
a
worker
at
maritsa
east
adding
that
bulgaria
was
having
to
pay
a
heavy
price
to
buy
the
carbon
permits
to
make
up
for
emissions
from
the
plant
a
spike
in
the
price
of
european
carbon
permits
has
widened
financial
losses
of
the
megawatt
maritsa
east
increasing
workers
fears
of
eventual
closure
they
say
any
move
to
shut
the
plant
could
cause
power
shortages
or
a
spike
in
power
prices
plants
produce
more
than
percent
of
bulgaria
s
electricity
the
government
has
said
it
would
work
to
ensure
they
continued
to
operate
bulgaria
s
two
major
trade
unions
say
the
european
commission
has
set
a
pace
for
creating
a
greener
economy
that
was
too
fast
and
too
costly
for
the
balkan
country
we
need
to
find
a
solution
because
it
is
not
fair
for
the
poorer
countries
said
vladimir
topalov

of

provides
livelihoods

has
appealed
against
a
european
commission
decision
to
impose
stricter

to
be
given
