analysis-pressure mounts to bury carbon emissions, but who will pay?
london
reuters
when
countries
gather
on
sunday
to
hammer
out
how
they
will
enact
pledges
to
cut
carbon
emissions
a
oil
consortium
will
offer
a
solution
pump
some
of
your
excess
carbon
dioxide
to
us
and
we
could
store
it
for
you
environmentalists
worry
the
costly
technology
known
as
carbon
capture
and
storage
ccs
will
perpetuate
the
fossil
fuel
status
quo
when
rapid
and
deep
cuts
energy
use
are
needed
to
limit
global
warming
but
proponents
of
ccs
will
be
lobbying
hard
at
the
climate
conference
in
katowice
poland
for
the
extensive
investment
and
regulatory
change
required
to
employ
it
at
scale
citing
assessments
that
it
could
play
a
role
the
expectation
is
that
katowice
will
be
important
said
stephen
bull
a
senior
vice
president
at
norwegian
oil
company
equinor
which
is
involved
in
developing
a
ccs
project
called
northern
lights
ccs
is
the
only
way
to
go
he
said
arguing
that
countries
need
the
technology
to
help
fulfil
the
pledges
they
made
around
the
time
of
the
breakthrough
paris
climate
change
agreement
in
a
united
nations
report
warned
on
tuesday
that
nations
would
have
to
triple
their
current
efforts
to
keep
global
temperature
rises
within
boundaries
scientists
say
are
needed
to
avoid
devastating
floods
storms
and
drought
along
with
the
united
states
norway
is
one
of
the
countries
at
the
forefront
of
drive
for
ccs
building
on
years
of
diverting
carbon
dioxide
from
its
vast
gas
output
and
using
some
to
push
out
oil
from
aging
fields
oslo
plans
what
it
says
will
be
the
first
viable
project
to
use
ccs
to
limit
industrial
emissions
by
taking
carbon
dioxide
from
industrial
plants
at
home
and
abroad
and
storing
it
permanently
in
empty
oil
reservoirs
under
the
seabed
the
relatively
small
scale
of
the
project
along
with
the
unsolved
problem
of
who
will
pay
for
it
highlight
the
obstacles
to
getting
ccs
technology
off
the
ground
organizers
of
the
estimated
billion
euros
billion
northern
lights
project
say
it
could
store
around
million
tonnes
per
year
of
emissions
from
a
norwegian
energy
plant
a
cement
plant
as
well
as
emissions
from
other
countries
this
is
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
billion
tonnes
per
year
that
would
need
to
be
stored
by
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
which
coordinates
industrialized
nations
energy
policies
the
project
still
needs
the
norwegian
government
to
take
a
final
investment
decision
something
which
trude
sundset
ceo
of
gasnova
the
norwegian
state
s
ccs
enterprise
said
was
scheduled
for
or
that
would
depend
on
how
the
project
developed
she
said
adding
it
was
also
necessary
to
bring
industry
and
other
countries
on
board
it
is
not
easy
to
find
a
good
business
model
in
the
short
medium
term
she
said
it
s
naive
to
think
one
country
can
pay
it
has
to
be
a
collaboration
between
industry
and
a
european
union
climate
strategy
published
on
wednesday
said
rapid
deployment
of
renewables
meant
the
potential
of
ccs
to
be
a
major
decarbonization
option
appeared
lower
than
before
but
it
said
ccs
would
be
needed
especially
if
the
bloc
wanted
to
reach
a
goal
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
for
sure
we
have
to
improve
carbon
capture
and
storage
and
we
have
to
invest

chief
miguel
arias
canete
told
reuters
earlier
attempts
to
fund
ccs
in
europe
have
largely
failed
an
eu
program
in
did
not
go
on
to
fund
a
single

project
and
a
british

was
canceled
in

government
now
plans
to
help
develop
the
country
s
first
commercial
project
which
will
capture
carbon
dioxide
to
be
used
in
industrial
applications
by
the
europe
s
green
party
prioritizes
energy
efficiency
recycling
and
renewable
energy
but
says
there
could
be
a
role
for
ccs
in
offsetting
emissions
from
processes
like
steelmaking
we
need
to
experiment
with
it
there
is
an
industrial
application

bas
eickhout
dutch

and
climate
spokesman
for
the
greens
told
reuters
the
problem
is
that
the
longer
we
wait
the
more
it
ccs
becomes
a
necessary
graphic
carbon
capture
technology
eighteen
ccs
plants
are
in
operation
around
the
world
according
to
the
global
ccs
institute
which
says
ccs
facilities
each
able
to
store
million
tonnes
a
year
would
be
needed
by
to
keep
global
warming
within
a
rise
countries
as
far
afield
as
algeria
and
japan
are
working
with
ccs
but
only
two
of
the
world
s
ccs
operations
are
on
power
plants
the
ccs
industry
sees
potential
for
many
more
while
europe
focuses
on
renewables
and
replacing
coal
with
gas
developing
countries
say
they
can
not
move
so
fast
and
president
donald
trump
who
pulled
his
country
out
of
the
s
paris
climate
change
accord
promotes
coal
but
the
institute
for
energy
economics
and
financial
analysis
ieefa
think
tank
said
this
month
that
coal
plants
are
having
a
difficult
time
competing
with
wind
and
solar
resources
which
have
come
down
rapidly
in
price
even
without
ccs
economics
is
a
serious
issue
and
to
do
ccs
on
a
wide
scale
you
need
to
build
a
whole
new
infrastructure
new
pipelines
find
repositories
which
would
work
inspection
equipment
and
then
monitoring
said
ieefa
s
david
schlissel
ieefa
estimates
putting
ccs
on
an
average
coal
plant
would
cost
nearly
hour
mwh
this
compares
to
average
power
purchase
agreement
prices
for
wind
and
solar
of
around
or
less
since
the
ccs
institute
which
represents
companies
involved
in
developing
the
technology
said
on
wednesday
a
feasibility
study
on
fitting
css
to
a
second
power
station
in
saskatchewan
canada
had
shown
it
could
be
done
more
cheaply
it
cited
a
cost
of
capture
at
per
ton
of
saying
the
study
showed
coal
could
be
competitive
with
natural
gas
major

are
also
counting
on
ccs
bhp
the
world
s
biggest
listed
miner
and
biggest
producer
of
coking
coal
used
in
has
set
a
goal
for
its
own
operations
to
be
net
zero
by
the
second
half
of
the
century
in
line
with
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
bhp
has
spun
off
many
operations
into
another
company
south
but
the
indirect
emissions
from
the
products
it
sells
remain
very
high
because
of
the
use
of
its
iron
ore
and
coking
coal
to
make
steel
it
has
also
said
it
hopes
to
expand
its
oil
production

you

not
serious
about
ccs

at
bhp
said
referring
to
limits
the
says
are
needed
to
avoid
a
dramatic
increase
in
heat
waves
floods
and
droughts
bhp
has
given
money
toward
ccs
research
in
china
but
says
the
technology
needs
investment
and
regulatory
support
from
countries
around
the
world
including
a
global
carbon
tax
rather
than
locals
ones
something
which
remains
a
long
way
off

which
depends
heavily
on
coal

mined
in
silesia
where
the
december
climate
talks
will
take
place
has
been
an
advocate
for
ccs
but
now
emphasizes
the
role
of
its
forests
calling
for
them
to
count
as
carbon
sinks
professor
stuart
haszeldine
from
edinburgh
university
s
school
of
geosciences
acknowledges
the
role
of
trees
but
says
ccs
is
the
only
way
to
reach
the
goal
of
net
zero
emissions
by
the
middle
of
the
century
trees
can
mop
up
but
one
tree
takes
kilograms
of
every
year
each
one
of
us
would
need
three
wembley
stadium
football
pitches
to
soak
up
