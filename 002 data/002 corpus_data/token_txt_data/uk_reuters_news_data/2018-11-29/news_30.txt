imports
mostly

t
see
that

there
will
be
no
power
plants
in
poland
the
life
span
of
power
plants
will
not
end
in
energy
minister
krzysztof
tchorzewski
told
the
same
press
conference
a
draft
version
of
poland
s
energy
strategy
lays
out
plans
to
reduce
the
share
of
coal
in
power
production
to
around
percent
by
from
around
percent
now
poland
has
also
laid
out
goals
to
replace
some
coal
with
offshore
wind
solar
and
also
nuclear
power
by
but
none
of
these
have
yet
had
government
consent
with
the
shift
to
nuclear
especially
divisive
poland
s
ruling
law
and
justice
pis
party
which
won
the
election
partly
on
a
promise
to
support
coal
production
argues
poland
can
not
afford
a
sudden
and
needs
the
transition
to
greener
energy
to
be
gradual
environmental
campaigners
are
seeking
to
increase
the
pressure
on
poland
for
change
and
this
week
greenpeace
activists
climbed
a
chimney
at
utility
pge
s
power
plant
on
thursday
greenpeace
threatened
to
sue
pge
unless
it
phases
out
coal
by
after
protesting
at
the
plant
we
have
written
to
pge
asking
the
coal
utility
to
do
what
is
needed
to
avoid
a
climate
catastrophe
if
pge
does
not
respond
to
these
requests
we
will
take
them
to
court
pawel
szypulski
from
greenpeace
