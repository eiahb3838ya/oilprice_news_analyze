that

jitters
ahead

talks
between

xi

on
saturday
on
the

of
the
summit
in

economists
at
anz
pointed
out
that
policy
hawks
in
the
trump
administration
who
want
washington
to
take
a
tough
stance
against
beijing
appear
to
be
in
the
ascendancy
they
will
want
some
concessions
from
china
not
least
of
all
on
what
they
perceive
is
theft
of
intellectual
property
and
forced
technology
transfer
wrote
the
anz
economists
thus
it
would
seem
the
prospect
of
the
meeting
ending
without

sustainable
resolution
to
their
differences
is
relatively
analysts
believe
any
signs
of
a
thaw
in
tensions
could
trigger
a
rally
but
say
the
move
would
likely
be
short
lived
unless
there
are
substantive
compromise
from
both
sides
most
notably
if
xi
can
persuade
trump
to
postpone
a
sharp
tariff
hike
on
chinese
goods
due
to
take

the

the
likelihood
of

monetary
tightening
caused
the

the
