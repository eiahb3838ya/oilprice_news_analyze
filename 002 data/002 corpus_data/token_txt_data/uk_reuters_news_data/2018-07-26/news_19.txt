the

mean
the

can
expect
higher
temperatures
and
more
frequent
heat
waves
climate
experts
have
warned
with
poor
communities
likely
to
be
worst
affected
heat
is
neglected
because
it
is
both
an
invisible
and
disaster
that
claims
lives
largely
behind
closed
doors
they
said
and
because
hot
weather
does
not
strike
many
people
as
a
serious
threat
the
warning
comes
as
hot
weather
has
swept
the
northern
hemisphere
britain
has
sweltered
in
a
prolonged
heat
wave
with
temperatures
set
to
test
national
records
the

meteorological
office
said
we
will
have
to
get
used
to
these
kinds
of
summers
said
friederike
otto
deputy
director
at
the
environmental
change
institute
at
oxford
university
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
is
a
link
to
climate
change
we
need
to
take
heat
waves
seriously
around
the
world
as
something
that
we
need
to
adapt
to

at

waves
are
becoming
more

consequences
stanford
university
researchers
on
monday
said
hotter
weather
was
linked
to
increases
in
suicides
after
examining
decades
worth
of
temperature
data
against
suicide
rates
in
counties
and
mexican
municipalities
some
dating
back
to
the
the
report
projected
that
if
global

were
not
capped
by
there
could
be
at

an
additional

president
donald
trump
has
vowed
to
pull
out
of
the
accord
which
would
make
his
country
the
only
one
to
do
so
nearly
one
in
three
people
around
the
world
are
already
exposed
to
deadly
heat
waves
and
that
will
rise
to
nearly
half
of
people
by
even
if
the
world
moves
aggressively
to
cut
emissions
a

of

study
found
in

poorer
communities
will
suffer
the
most
said
frank
rijsberman

of
the
global
green
growth
institute
which
helps
developing
countries
adopt
clean
energy
to
boost
their
economies
and
reduce
carbon
emissions
in
developed
countries
we
have
resources
we
have
money
we
have
systems
we
can
manage
but
in
developing
countries
where
resilience
is
very
low
people
are
hit
much
harder
he
said
in
an
interview
about
billion
people
in
asia
africa
and
latin
america
are
at
risk
from
a
lack
of
air
conditioning
to
keep
them
cool
as
global
warming
brings
more
high
temperatures
the
sustainable
energy
for
all
said
in
a
study
last
week
the
most
vulnerable
in
society
will
be
most
affected
because
those
are
the
people
who
do
not
have
the
offices
to
go
to
the
people
who
have
to
work
outside
to
make
a
living
said
otto
they
will
be
hit
very
hard
by
these
increasing
risks
and
