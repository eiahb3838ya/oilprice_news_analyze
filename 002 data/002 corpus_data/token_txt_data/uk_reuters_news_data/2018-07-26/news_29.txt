ukraine
on
thursday
extended
a
freeze
on
gas
prices
until
at
least
reducing
its
prospects
of
securing
more
money
from
the
international
monetary
fund
needed
to
keep
its
economy
on
a
stable
footing
ukraine
must
raise
gas
prices
to
market
levels
in
order
to
qualify
for
more
aid
under
a
billion
imf
programme
it
initially
agreed
to
raise
prices
under
a
jointly
agreed
formula
but
has
since
postponed
price
rises
a
number
of
times
the
government
may
shy
away
from
potentially
unpopular
measures
like
gas
price
hikes
with
presidential
and
parliamentary
elections
due
next
year
ukraine
has
received
no
imf
money
since
april
due
to
a
slowdown
in
reforms
putting
the
country
in
a
more
financially
precarious
position
as
it
must
repay
around
billion
of
foreign
currency
debt
in
the
next
two
years
the
government
said
talks
with
the
imf
were
continuing
but
signalled
its
reluctance
to
meet
the
fund
s
terms
negotiations
are
ongoing
the
government
said
in
a
statement
the
government
of
ukraine
stresses
that
the
price
of
gas
is
too
sensitive
a
topic
to
approach
in
a
purely
mathematical
ukraine
earlier
in
july
fulfilled
another
of
the
imf
s
conditions
by
passing
legislation
to
set
up
a
special
court
to
try
corruption
cases
but
that
on
its
own
is
unlikely
to
lead
to
more
imf
disbursements
asked
for
comment
on
thursday
s
decision
an
imf
spokesman
repeated
that
ukraine
had
fulfilled
its
obligations
on
the
corruption
court
and
discussions
on
other
outstanding
issues
including
gas
prices
and
the
government
budget
are
ongoing
the
country
s
economy
crashed
following
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
in
and
the
outbreak
of
separatist
fighting
in
the
donbass
region
ukraine
plans
to
ramp
up
its
borrowing
in
order
to
manage
its
debts
and
reduce
its
sensitivity
to
exchange
rates
which
arises
from
much
of
its
debt
being

finance
minister
