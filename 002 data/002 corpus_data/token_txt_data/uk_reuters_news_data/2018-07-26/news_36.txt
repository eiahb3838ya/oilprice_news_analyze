are
a
more
effective
approach

juncker
said
the

the

administration
frequently
criticizes
for
favoring

trump
s
threat
to
impose
tariffs
on

grounds
would
hit
european
carmakers
bmw
daimler

as
well
as
japanese
and
south
korean
car
companies
the
commerce
department
could
recommend
new

as
early
as
september
after
an
investigation
into
whether
car
imports
posed
a
risk
to
national
security
the
two
leaders
did
not
specifically
mention
car
tariffs
in
their
statements
keeping
the
focus
on
other
industrial
products

said
there
was
significant
pressure
from
trump
administration
officials
to
increase

an
escalating
trade
fight
between
washington

the
pain
for
a
politically
important
trump
constituency
juncker
said
the
european
union
would
build
more

they

so
they
