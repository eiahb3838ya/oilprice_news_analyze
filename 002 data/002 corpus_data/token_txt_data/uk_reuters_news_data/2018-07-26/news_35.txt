producers
the

inc
s
takeover
of
nxp
semiconductors
likely
shutting
the
door
on
the

beijing
s
okay
because

when
he
called

day
with
the

the

led
by

demonstrates
that
bilateral
negotiations
are
a
more
effective
approach
to
resolving

and
juncker
said
the
talks
would
seek
to
eliminate

the
trump
administration
frequently
criticizes
for
favoring
trading
partners
trump
s
threat
to
impose
tariffs
on
auto
imports
on
national
security
grounds
would
hit
european
carmakers
bmw
daimler
and
volkswagen
as
well
as
japanese
and
south
korean
car
companies
the
commerce
department
could
recommend
new
tariffs
as
early
as
september
after
an
investigation
into
whether
car
imports
posed
a
risk
to
national
security
the
two
leaders
did
not
specifically
mention
car
tariffs
in
their
statements
keeping
the
focus
on
other
industrial
products
an

official
said
there
was
significant
pressure
from
trump
administration
officials
to
increase

beijing
and
trump
has
been
promising
relief
on
tuesday
his
administration
said
it
would
use
a
program
to
pay
farmers
up
to
billion
easing
the
pain
for
a
politically
important
trump
constituency
juncker
said
the
european
union
would
build
more
terminals
to
import

they
re
going
to
be
a
massive
buyer
of
lng
so
they
ll
be
able
