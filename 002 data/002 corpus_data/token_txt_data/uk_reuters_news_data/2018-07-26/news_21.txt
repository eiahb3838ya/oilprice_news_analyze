the
united
arab
emirates
is
ready
to
deploy
more
troops
across
the
middle
east
to
counter
its
foes
as
it
believes
it
can
no
longer
rely
on
western
allies
like
the
united
states
and
britain
uae
minister
anwar
gargash
said
on
thursday
filling
the
vacuum
left
by
the
administration
of
former
president
barack
obama
the
uae
has
extended
its
influence
by
deploying
troops
and
cash
across
the
middle
east
and
africa
where
it
has
built
up
local
armies
and
set
up
military
bases
in
this
current
international
system
it
is
no
longer
write
a
cheque
and
someone
is
going
to
come
and
secure
the
stability
in
the
you
have
to
do
some
of
the
gargash
minister
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
said
in
a
speech
in
london
the
uae
has
been
fighting
the
houthis
in
yemen
for
more
than
three
years
and
backed
forces
opposed
to
political
islam
in
libya
and
elsewhere
with
its
closest
ally
saudi
arabia
the
uae
has
been
locked
in
a
power
struggle
with
their
iran
that
has
played
out
across
the
region
and
taken
on
a
sectarian
dimension
each
accuses
the
other
of
creating
instability
in
the
region
gargash
said
he
was
concerned
about
divergence
between
western
powers
over
the
future
of
relations
with
iran
as
we
move
forward
we
do
really
hope
that
the
current
american
effort
to
bring
about
a
change
in
iranian
approach
is
successful
we
are
worried
a
little
bit
about
what
is
seen
as
a
divergence
of
view
between
europe
and
the
united
states
over
iran
he
said
at
the
policy
exchange
think
tank
event
uae
sees
the
more
forceful
approach
towards
iran
taken
by
the
united
states
as
a
more
effective
means
of
curbing
what
it
sees
as
iran
s
malign
activity
and
development
of
ballistic
missiles
than
european
attempts
to
rescue
a
iran
nuclear
deal
in
may
donald
trump
withdrew
from
the
multinational
agreement
that
lifted
sanctions
in
exchange
for
curbs
on
tehran
s
nuclear
programme
calling
it
a
horrible
deal
gargash
also
said
uae
was
engaging
in
a
mediation
process
with
somalia
whose
coastline
sits
close
to
key
shipping
routes
and
across
the
water
from
yemen
following
a
row
over
the
seizure
of
several
million
dollars
from
a
uae
civilian
aircraft
at
mogadishu
airport
there
are
attempts
currently
to
mediate
between
us
and
somalia
he
said
we
d
like
to
continue
to
do
our
work
but
we
have
made
it
very
clear
that
we
have
been
wronged
with
regards
to
how
we
were
treated
with
the
shipment
of
million
dollars
we
are
asking
for
an
apology
