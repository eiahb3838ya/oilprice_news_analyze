liz
young
senior
investment
strategist
at
bny
mellon
investment
management
said
investor
skepticism
of
the
market
s
run
is
leading
people
to
take
a
close
look
at
corporate
earnings
and
other
fundamental
factors
rather
than
jumping
on
the
bandwagon
and
investing
in
tech
people
need
to
be
careful
right
now
to
be
in
those
trendy
trades
she
said
the
heat
has
eased
somewhat
over
and
european
trade
issues
allowing
markets
to
return
their
attention
to
central
banks
and
their
plans
to
withdraw
stimulus
the
lifting
of
the
threat
of
tariffs
on
the
auto
sector
in
particular
is
a
major
development

the
euro
which
initially
received
the
trade
news
warmly
sharply
lost
ground
after
european
central
bank
boss
mario
draghi
reaffirmed
a
commitment
to
keep
interest
rates
on
hold
through
next
summer
even
though
he
saw
inflation
picking
up
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
euro
was
last
down
percent
to
concerns
about
facebook

major

an
otherwise

late
on

progress
on
trade
also
helped
demand
for
oil
which
is
sensitive
to
economic
growth
prospects
crude
prices
were
also
helped
as
saudi
arabia
suspended
oil
shipments
through
a
strait

the

after
an

by
no
means
removed
from
a
slate
of
issues
facing
investors
with
the
