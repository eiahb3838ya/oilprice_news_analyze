told
reuters
everybody
is
very
anxious

confused
about
how
they
could
put
the

for
shipments
sold
on
a
fob
basis
on
which
the
vast
majority
of
indonesia

the
rules

unworkable
this
can
not
be
carried
out
for
fob
sales
because
we
don
t
have
rights
to
control
the
buyer
he
said
adding
that
fob
shipping
terms
were
preferable
as
they
were
