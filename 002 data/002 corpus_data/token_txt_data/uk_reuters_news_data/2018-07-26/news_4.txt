washington
july
reuters
numerous
congressional
republicans
worried
about
jobs
for
constituents
back
home
remained
skeptical
of
president
donald
trump
s
trade
policies
on
thursday
a
day
after
trump
struck
a
surprise
deal
with
the
eu
to
halt
further
tariffs
and
hold
talks
on
opening
markets
the
republican
lawmakers
who
face
voters
in
congressional
elections
this
autumn
spelled
out
their
anxieties
in
a
meeting
at
the
capitol
with
trump
s
trade
adviser
peter
navarro
and
his
economic
chief
larry
kudlow
let
me
tell
you
that
was
a
vociferous
bunch
in
there
and
i
was
not
the
only
one
representative
andy
barr
of
kentucky
told
reporters
after
the
gathering
barr
said
he
had
sought
to
find
out
from
navarro
and
kudlow
what
the
impact
of
wednesday
s
deal
would
be
on
kentucky
s
bourbon
industry
last
month
the
european
union
imposed
tariffs
on
bourbon
american
motorcycles
orange
juice
and
other
products
in
response
to
the
steel
and
aluminum
tariffs
imposed
by
the
trump
administration
this
year
barr
said
he
emphasized
to
navarro
and
kudlow
that
jobs
in
kentucky
were
connected
with
the
bourbon
industry
and
these
jobs
are
not
less
important
than
the
jobs
associated
with
the
aluminum
and
trump
s
pursuit
of
aggressive
measures
against
trading
partners
from
china
to
europe
and
canada
has
put
him
at
odds
with
the
republican
orthodoxy
of
recent
years
after
wednesday
s
pact
with
the
eu
was
announced
it
was
not
immediately
clear
that
trump
who
has
touted
tariffs
as
key
to
bringing
manufacturing
jobs
back
to
america
had
abandoned
his
previous
trade
policies
republican
lawmakers
attending
thursday
s
meeting
with
administration
officials
said
the
eu
pact
was
encouraging
but
the
devil
is
in
the
details
as
representative
jeb
hensarling
chairman
of
the
financial
services
committee
said
and
the
details
here
are
a
little
bit
republican
lawmakers
repeated
their
previous
warnings
against
the
administration
levying
new
tariffs
on
auto
imports
and
said
they
were
told
that
may
not
happen
representative
roger
williams
who
owns
a
car
dealership
in
texas
said
dealers
were
already
beginning
to
cancel
orders
with
manufacturers
because
they
were
fearful
of
tariffs
as
well
as
rising
interest
rates
another
republican
lawmaker
representative
bill
huizenga
of
michigan
said
the
administration
s
trade
policies
had
been
painful
and
damaging
to
auto
suppliers
in
his
state
that
supply
both
foreign
and
domestic
cars
our
ag
agriculture
folks
are
also
getting
squeezed
with
tariffs
we
are
kind
of
getting
it
coming
and
going
in
western
michigan
