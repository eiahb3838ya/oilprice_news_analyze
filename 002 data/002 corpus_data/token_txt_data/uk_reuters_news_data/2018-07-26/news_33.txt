troops
searched
for
survivors
in
the
remote
southern
tip
of
laos
on
thursday
three
days
after
the
collapse
of
a
hydropower
dam
sent
a
torrent
of
water
charging
across
paddy
fields
and
through
villages
as
rescuers
rushed
aid
to
thousands
of
homeless
the
scale
of
the
disaster
was
still
unclear
in
part
because
of
the
inaccessibility
of
the
area
but
also
because
reports
from
the
communist
country
s
state
media
have
been
scant
and
sketchy
for

the
official
laos
news
agency
said
that
people
were
confirmed
dead
and
were
missing
following
the
failure
of
the
dam
on
monday
a
subsidiary
structure
under
construction
as
part
of
a
hydroelectric
project
in
the
province
of
attapeu
earlier
reports
had
suggested
the
death
toll
would
be
much
higher
and
on
wednesday
the
vientiane
times
had
said
more
than
people
were
waiting
to
be
rescued
from
swirling
floodwaters
many
of
them
on
trees
and
the
rooftops
of
submerged
houses
in
the
village
of
khokong
a
sea
of
mud
oozed
around
the
stilt
houses
that
were
still
standing
and
dead
animals
floated
in
the
water
seven
villages
were
hit
two
very
badly
there
were
houses
and
only
about
are
left
standing
said
a
medical
official
who
declined
to
be
named
because
he
was
not
authorised
to
speak
to
the
media
we
retrieved
one
body
today
i
suspect
there
will
be
more
as
the
water
goes
down
and
the
road
becomes
easier
to
he
said
villagers
were
warned
about
three
to
four
hours
before
the
dam
burst
but
few
had
expected
the
water
to
rise
as
high
as
it
did
the
office
for
the
coordination
of
humanitarian
affairs
said
roads
and
bridges
were
damaged
and
boat
and
helicopter
were
the
only
means
of
transport
in
the
areas
schools
in
safe
areas
were
being
used
as
evacuation
centres
and
about
families
needed
tents
for
shelter

to
the
small
town
of
sanamxai
reuters
saw
trucks
carrying
aid
including
fresh
water
and
blankets
for
those
made
homeless
the
government
put
their
number
at
phra
ajan
thanakorn
a
buddhist
monk
returning
from
sanamxai
said
he
had
delivered
food
and
medicine
in
four
trucks
that
had
come
from
vientiane
the
capital
some
km
miles
to
the
north
and
he
was
heading
back
there
to
load
up
with
more
the
situation
is
really
bad
he
told

all
the
relief
efforts
are
at
sanamxai
there
are
volunteers
distributing
food
and
medicine
for

every
day
there
they
are
still
lacking
food

poorest
countries
has
ambitions
to
become
the
battery
of
asia
through
the
construction
of
multiple
dams
its
government
depends
almost
entirely
on
outside
developers
to
build
the
dams
under
commercial
concessions
that
involve
the
export
of
electricity
to
more
developed
neighbours
including
thailand
laos
has
finished
building
dams
says
thai
group
terra
with
more
under
construction
and
dozens
planned
rights
groups
have
repeatedly
warned
against
the
human
and
environmental
cost
of
the
dam
drive
including
damage
to
the
already
fragile
ecosystem
of
the
region
s
rivers
the
dam
that

washed
away
and
the
company
was
cooperating
with
the
laos
government
to
help
rescue
villagers
the
firm
blamed
the
collapse
on
heavy

these
people
