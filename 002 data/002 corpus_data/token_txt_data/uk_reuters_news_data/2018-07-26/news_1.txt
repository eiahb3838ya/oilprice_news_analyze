authorities
are
studying
the
possibility
of
inking
a
social
and
environmental
deal

norsk
hydro
after

was
accused
of
polluting
the

signaling
a
potential
warming
in
relations
between
the
government
and
the
norwegian

norsk
hydro
was
ordered
by
brazilian
regulators
in
february
to
slash
output
from
alunorte

world
s
largest
alumina
refinery
after
the
company
admitted
to
making
unlicensed
emissions
of
untreated
water
during
severe
rains
that
month
the
company
has
however
denied
many
parts
of
prosecutors
allegations
and
argued
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
lasting
environmental
impact
the
production
cut
triggered
cutbacks
at
its
nearby
albras
aluminum
plant
and
a
scramble
by
customers
for
supplies
on
thursday
prosecutors
for
the
state
of
para
where
the
plant
is
located
said
a
deal
was
also
being
considered

state
government
and
federal
prosecutors
and
would
include
social
and
environmental
obligations
on
their
part
as
well
as
the
company
s
the
statement
clarified
that
such
a
deal
would
not
include
a
resumption
of
the
halted
production
and
did
not
provide
a
timeline
for
a
deal
adding
that
it
still
needed
to
be
evaluated
by
the
state
government
norsk
hydro
said
this
week
that
the
timing
for
resuming
full
output
at
its
alunorte
alumina
refinery
remains
uncertain
but
that
it
could
be
achieved
between
october
and
the
middle
of
alunorte
transforms
bauxite
to
alumina
which
is
turned
into
aluminum
at
huge
smelters
founded
in

of
alumina
a
year
