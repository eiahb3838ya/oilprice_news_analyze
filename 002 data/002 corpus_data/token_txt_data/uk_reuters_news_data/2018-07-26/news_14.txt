saudi

said
on
thursday
it
was
suspending
oil
shipments
through
the
red

after
yemen
s
houthis
attacked
two
crude
tankers
underscoring
risks
caused
by
the
conflict
in
the
world
s
top
oil
exporting
region
iran
in
its
row
with
the
united
states
over
sanctions
has
also
threatened
to
block
the
strait
of
hormuz
the
other
major
strategic
shipping
route
for
oil
from
the
region
and
the
main
route
for
iranian
crude
exports
below

routes
bab
any
move
to
block
the
bab
the
narrow
waterway
between
the
coasts
of
yemen
and
africa
at
the
southern
end
of
the
red
sea
would
virtually
halt
oil
shipments
through
egypt
s
suez
canal
or
the
sumed
crude
pipeline
that
link
the
red
sea
and
mediterranean
the
sumed
pipeline
with
capacity
for
million
bpd
runs
roughly
parallel
to
the
suez
canal
and
can
be
used
by
oil
tankers
that
can
not
navigate
the
canal
waterway
an
estimated
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
oil
and
refined
petroleum
products

data
shows
saudi
crude
exports
through
bab
which
is
about
miles
km
wide
at
its
narrowest
point
between
djibouti
s
coast
and
the
yemeni
mainland
are
estimated
to
be
bpd
closing
the
strait
which
has
a
shipping
channel
just
two
miles
km
wide
would
force
oil
and
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
tankers
around
the
southern
tip
of
africa
extending
the
distance
for
a
vessel
travelling
between
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
states
by
miles
km
this
would
add
weeks
to
the
journey
time
and
extra
costs
although
saudi
arabia
could
export
its
crude
along
that
route
on
vessels
about
million
bpd
of
oil
or
more
than
percent
of
seaborne
traded
crude
was
transported
in
through
the
strait
of
hormuz
making
the
waterway
at
the
southern
end
of
the
gulf
the
most
important
oil
transit
channel
in
the
world
according
to
eia
figures
the
strait
which
is
about
miles
km
wide
at
its
narrowest
point
separates
the
arabian
peninsula
from
iran
most
of
the
crude
exported
from
saudi

iran
the

kuwait
and
iraq
must
slip
through
a
four
mile
km
wide

between
the
omani

iranian
coasts
more
than
percent
of
the
crude
oil
that
moves
through
it
is
sent
to

known
as

mainly
transports
crude
from
the

s
eastern
fields
to

which
lies
north
of

so

could
avoid
that

the

muajjiz

for

through
the
iraqi
pipeline
in

but
it
has
not
carried

iran
the
uae
kuwait
and

rely
almost
entirely
on
the
strait
of
hormuz
a
kuwaiti
official
said
percent
of
kuwaiti
oil
shipments
go
to
asia
and
do
not
pass
through

the
remaining
percent
of
its
shipments
passing
through

chokepoint
were
mostly
refined

of

through

in
according
to
bp
statistics
nearly
percent
of
iraq
s
crude
is
exported
through
gulf
ports
and
through
the

most
of
it
heads
to
asia
iran
s
total
reliance
on
crude
exports
through
the

of

is
one
of
the
reasons
why
it

unlikely
to
be
