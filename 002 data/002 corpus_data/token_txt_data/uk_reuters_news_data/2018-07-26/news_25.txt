norwegian
oil

firm
equinor
said
on
thursday
adjusted
operating
income
rose
from
a
year
ago
but
missed
forecasts
due
to
higher
maintenance
costs
at
its
norwegian
fields
the
company
formerly
known
as
statoil
also
said
it
was
too
early
to
follow
peers
such
as
shell
and
total
with
share
buyback
programmes
as
it
had
investment
plans
to
fund
we
did
not
feel
it
was
natural
in
the
second
quarter
to
launch
buybacks
because
we
have
big
projects
and
increased
working
capital
we
need
to
come
back
to
the
question
at
a
later
point

from
percent
in

first
quarter
equinor
s
executives
previously
said
their
priority
was
to
reduce
gearing
before
launching
any
buybacks
the
company
offered
a
quarterly
dividend
of
per

as
forecast
and
has
previously
said
it
expected
to
maintain
that
in
the
third

some
analysts
expect
equinor
to
pay
more
to
its
shareholders
in
the
despite
some
headwinds

we

to
see
the
company
generate

earnings
from
the
biggest
of
the
company
s
three
divisions
the
norwegian
exploration
and
production
were
affected
by
higher
turnaround
activity
equinor
said
new
fields
higher
maintenance
work
and
items
contributed
to
an
increase
in
costs
the
company
added
chief
financial
officer
hans
jakob
hegge
said
higher
operational
costs
were
expected
at
some
norwegian
fields
and
from
suppliers
in
the
united
states
but
he
said
equinor
still
had
good
control
on
costs
this
underlines
the
importance
of
continued
cost
focus
across
the
organisation
chief
executive
eldar
saetre
said
in
a
statement
the
norwegian
company
has
maintained
its
guidance
on
capital
spending
and
production
growth
but
it
now
sees
a
bigger
impact
on
its
production
due
to
higher
maintenance
equinor
expected
maintenance
work
to
pull
down
output
by
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
boepd
for
instead
of
the
boepd
it
previously
saw
equinor
s
equity
production
stood
at
million
boepd
in
the
second
quarter
up
percent
from
the
same
quarter
a
year
ago
the
increase
was
underpinned
by
higher
output
in
the
united
states
which
was
once
a
struggling
operation
for
the
company
but
has
now
turned
