europe
looks
set
to
install
gigawatts
gw
of
new
wind
power
capacity
this
year
slightly
lower
than
last
year
s
record
of
gw
according
to
estimates
by
industry
group
windeurope
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
europe
installed
gw
of
onshore
wind
mainly
in
germany
france
and
denmark
a
further
gw
of
new
offshore
wind
capacity
was
also
added
mainly
in
britain
belgium
and
denmark
for
the
whole
of
the
year
gw
of
new
onshore
wind
and
gw
of
new
offshore
wind
is
expected
we
are
on
track
for
a
solid
year
in
new
wind
farm
installations
but
the
growth
is
driven
by
just
a
handful
of
markets
windeurope
s
chief
policy
officer
pierre
tardieu
said
in
a
statement
windeurope
expects
a
drop
in
france
s
new
installations
because
of
administrative
issues
which
have
resulted
in
the
country
s
latest
auction
being
in
offshore
wind
europe
is
too
dependent
on
the
uk
which
is
striding
ahead
in
current
installations
and
in
committing
to
future
volumes
tardieu
said
by
contrast
the
rate
of
new
installations
has
slowed
down
in
germany
other
countries
also
need
to
beef
up
and
speed
up
their
plans
on
offshore
wind
he
added
the
new
german
government
has
also
been
slow
to
reveal
when
gw
of
new
onshore
wind
promised
for
will
be
auctioned
and
to
confirm
auction
volumes
beyond
that
