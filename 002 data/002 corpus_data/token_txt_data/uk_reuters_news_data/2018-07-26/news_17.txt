in
yemen
which
lies
on
one
side
of
the

at
the
southern
mouth
of
the

one
of
the
most
important
trade
routes
for
oil

heading
from

the

who
have
previously
threatened

said
the
houthis
attacked
two
saudi
oil
tankers
in
the
red

on
wednesday
one
of
which
sustained
minimal
damage
saudi
arabia
is
temporarily
halting
all
oil
shipments
through
bab
strait
immediately
until
the
situation
becomes
clearer
and
the
maritime
transit
through
bab
is
safe
he
said
it
was
not
clear
if
a
military
coalition
would
take
additional
security
measures
or
impose
further
restrictions
on
imports
to
yemen
which
is
struggling
with
the
world
s
most
urgent
humanitarian
crisis
a
senior
oil
source
said
saudi
arabia
had
already
beefed
up
oil
security
and
that
all
crude
vessels
in
the
area
are
accompanied
by
security
ships
saudi
crude
exports
through
bab
are
estimated
at
around
barrels
per
day
bpd
according
to
analysts
and

most

the
chairman
of

company

the
country
was
considering
whether
to
follow
suit
the

revolutionary
guards
quds
force
qassem
soleimani
criticised
the
role
in
the
red
sea
the
red
sea
which
was
secure
is
no
longer
secure
with
the
american
presence
president
donald
trump
should
know
that
we
are
nation
of
martyrdom
and
that
we
await
him
soleimani
was
quoted
as
saying
on
thursday
industry
and
shipping
sources
said
the
suspension
was
unlikely
to
impact
saudi
crude
supplies
to
asia
but
could
add
shipping
costs
to
saudi
vessels
heading
to
europe
and
the
united
states
due
to
a
longer
transit
traders
said
the
suspension
order
was
only
for
vessels
so
saudi
aramco
could
still
charter
foreign
ships
to
move
its
crude
saudi
arabia
also
has
a
pipeline
route
to
the
city
of
yanbu
on
the
red

keeping
europe
and
north
america
well
supplied
the
petroline
the
world
s
largest
oil
exporter
has
kept
its
crude
shipments
flowing
during
previous
regional
conflicts
including
the
war
when
the
two
sides
sought
to
disrupt
each
other
s
oil
exports
in
what
was
known
as
the
tanker
war
the
opec
heavyweight
a
key
ally
has
led
a
pact
among
oil
producers
to
boost
output
to
cool
the
market
after
trump
imposed
sanctions
on
iran
and
criticised
opec
for
high
prices
saudi
state
media
reported
shortly
after
falih
s
announcement
that
the
kingdom
s
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
chaired
a
meeting
of
the
political
and
security
affairs
council
but
did
not
mention
what
topics
were
discussed
saudi
arabia
leads
a
coalition
of
sunni
muslim
arab
states
which
intervened
in
yemen
s
war
in
to
restore
the
internationally
recognised
government
in
exile
and
thwart
what
riyadh
sees
as
tehran
s
expansionist
ambitions
in
the
region
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
backed
trump
s
decision
to
quit
a
nuclear
deal
with
iran
they
accuse
iran
of
supplying
the
houthis
with
weapons
including
missiles
which
the
group
and
tehran
deny
the
latest
attack
on
saudi
oil
tankers
could
strengthen
the
arab
states
position
ahead
of
possible
peace
talks
between
yemen
s
warring
parties
which
aim
to
avoid
an
assault
on
the
country
s
main
port
city
of
hodeidah
the
military
alliance
launched
an
offensive
on
june
to
wrest
hodeidah
from
the
houthis
in
a
bid
to
cut
off
the
primary
supply
line
of
the
movement
which
holds
the
most
populated
areas
of
yemen
including
the
capital
sanaa
but
the
alliance
did
not
make
major
gains
and
on
july
it
halted
operations
to
give
the
united
nations
a
chance
to
resolve
the
situation
in
hodeidah
and
the
wider
conflict
which
has
killed
more
than
people
the
only
way
forward
is
to
get
hodeidah
what
we
are
planning
to
do
is
give
diplomacy
every
possible
chance
to
secure
that
anwar
gargash
the
uae
s
minister
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
said
in
london
the
united
nations
fears
that
cutting
off
hodeidah
may
trigger
a
famine
in
yemen
where
around
million
people
are
believed
to
be
on
the
verge
of
starvation
the
united
nations
says
the
houthis
have
offered
to
hand
over
management
of
the
port
to
the
world
body
but
the
coalition
says
that
the
houthis
must
quit
the
western
coast
one
of
the
coalition
s
main
justifications
for
intervening
in
yemen
was
to
protect
shipping
routes
such
as
the
red
sea
it
has
said
it
foiled
previous
attacks
there
in
april
and
may
the
bab
strait
is
only
miles
km
wide
making
hundreds
of
ships
potentially
an
easy
target
the
energy
information
administration
said
an
estimated
million
bpd
of
crude
oil
and
products
flowed
through
it
