world
trade
volumes
continued
to
rise
in
may
but
the
rate
of
growth
is
decelerating
consistent
with
other
signs
that
the
global
economic
expansion
is
moving
into
a
slower
phase
trade
volumes
rose
by
percent
in
may
compared
with
april
according
to
the
latest
data
from
the
netherlands
bureau
for
economic
policy
analysis
world
trade
monitor
cpb
july
but
volumes
in
the
three
months
from
march
to
may
were
just
percent
higher
than
in
the
same
period
a
year
earlier
a
marked
slowdown
from
growth
of
over
percent
in
late
and
early
the
fastest
growth
in
may
was
reported
in
china
asia
the
middle
east
and
the
united
states
with
volumes
in
most
other
regions
actually
declining
during
the
month
volumes
on
the
routes
are
likely
to
have
been
flattered
by
the
race
to
beat
tariffs
announced
by
the
united
states
and
china
which
led
to
an
upsurge
in
container
arrivals
in
may
and
june
the
impact
will
probably
prove
temporary
and
is
likely
to
unwind
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
as
the
tariffs
go
into
effect
and
the
supply
chain
digests
higher
than
normal
inventories
after
stocking
up
in
much
of
the
rest
of
the
world
the
picture
is
one
of
moderating
and
increasingly
unbalanced
growth
after
the
strong
synchronised
upturn
in
the
trade
figures
are
consistent
with
leading
indicators
compiled
by
the
organization
for
economic
cooperation
and
development
oecd
which
show
the
rate
of
economic
growth
peaking
in
the
second
half
of
the
oecd
s
composite
indicators
show
growth
accelerating
in
the
united
states
china
and
india
in
the
early
months
of
this
year
but
losing
momentum
in
other
countries
signs
of
a
moderation
in
growth
are
also
evident
in
south
korea
s
kospi
share
index
often
seen
as
a
leading
indicator
for
world
trade
growth
given
the
country
s
heavy
export
orientation
over
the
last
two
decades
the
kopsi
share
index
has
been
closely
correlated
with
world
trade
volumes
as
measured
by
the
netherlands
government
statistics
the
index
peaked
at
the
end
of
and
has
been
steadily
sliding
throughout
the
first
seven
months
of
kospi
was
up
percent
in
the
months
to
october
but
the
annual
comparisons
have
gradually
become
less
favourable
and
annual
growth
turned
negative
in
june
and
july
if
kospi
remains
a
good
early
warning
indicator
global
trade
growth
seems
likely
to
slow
further

the
next
