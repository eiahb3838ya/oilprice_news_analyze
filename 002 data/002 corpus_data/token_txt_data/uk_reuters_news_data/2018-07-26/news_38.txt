india
s
hindustan
petroleum
corp
hpcl
cancelled
the
purchase
of
an
iranian
oil
cargo
earlier
this
month
after
its
insurance
company
refused
to
provide
coverage
for
the
crude
because
of
sanctions
three
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
hpcl
india
s
refiner
renewed
its
installation
insurance
which
protects
against
any
accidents
at
its
refinery
or
storage
sites
in
early
july
however
the
new
policy
would
not
protect
against
any
incidents
involving
iranian
oil
processed
or
stored
at
its
refineries
the
sources
said
the
refiner
had
planned
to
load
million
barrels
of
iranian
crude
onto
the
suezmax
tanker
ankaleshwar
in
early
july
but
cancelled
the
purchase
after
it
was
unable
to
sell
it
on
to
another
buyer
said
the
sources
who
declined
to
be
identified
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
matter
india
is
the
buyer
of
iranian
crude
after
china
and
without
insurance
coverage
to
protect
their
plants
the
country
s
refineries
may
have
to
cut
off
their
imports
earlier
than
anticipated
the
united
states
said
in
may
it
plans
to
some
sanctions
against
iran
starting
in
august
with
full
sanctions
in
place
by
november
after
withdrawing
from
a
accord
with
iran
limiting
its
nuclear
programme
hpcl
faced
problems
in
lifting
cargo
from
iran
because
its
annual
insurance
policy
was
renewed
in
july
after
the
pulled
out
of
the
nuclear
deal
in
may
said
one
of
the
sources
adding
the
company
will
not
be
able
to
lift
any
iranian
oil
hpcl
s
iranian
imports
account
for
only
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
its
full
demand
of
bpd
but
other
indian
refiners
that
take
larger
volumes
are
likely
to
face
the
same
problem
if
their
annual
policy
is
up
for
renewal
before
november
hpcl
did
not
respond
to
requests
from
reuters
for
a
comment
companies
have
until
to
fully
wind
down
activities
with
iran
or
risk
exclusion
from
the
financial
system
however
banks
shipping
firms
and
insurance
companies
are
already
cutting
ties
with
iran
and
without
financing
or
insurance
coverage
refiners
will
have
to
halt
their
purchases
iran
had
hoped
to
sell
more
than
bpd
of
oil
to
india
during
the
current
fiscal
year
that
started
in
april
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
in
february
however
the
insurance
issues
may
mean
a
reduction
in
imports
even
as
india
is
intent
on
continuing
dealings
with
iran
the
problem
in
procuring
iranian
barrels
appears
to
be
happening
much
before
the
deadline
said
senthil
kumaran
a
senior
analyst
at
consultants
fge
most
of
the
reinsurance
market
is
based
in
the
so
without
the
blessing
of
the
iranian
oil
buyers
will
find
it
almost
impossible
to
take
and
process
iranian
indian
insurers
rely
on
general
insurance
corp
for
reinsurance
which
depends
on
western
to
hedge
its
risk

insurance
