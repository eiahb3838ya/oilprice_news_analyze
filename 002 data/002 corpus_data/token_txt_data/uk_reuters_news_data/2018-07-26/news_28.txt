said
this
is
a
totally
irresponsible
act
he
told
an

the
effect

actually
is
much
wider

he
added
i
think
this
is
another
example
of
why
the
houthi
takeover
of
the
yemeni
government
in
sanaa
should
saudi
arabia
and
iran
have
been
locked
in
a
proxy

lies
on

sea
one
of
the
most
important
trade
routes
for
oil

heading
from
the

to
europe
the
uae
is
part
of
a
coalition
of
arab
states
fighting
to
gain
control
of
the
main
port
of
hodeidah
the
only
way
forward
is
to
get
hodeidah
gargash
said
what
we
are
planning
to
do
is
give
