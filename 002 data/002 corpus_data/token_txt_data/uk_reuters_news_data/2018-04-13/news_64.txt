new
york
reuters
global
energy
giants
chevron
corp
and
exxon
mobil
have
asked
regulators
for
exemptions
to
the
nation
s
biofuels
policy
that
have
historically
been
reserved
for
small
companies
in
financial
distress
according
to
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
the
requests
will
add
fuel
to
a
raging
dispute
between
big
oil
and
big
corn
over
how
the
trump
administration
should
manage
the
renewable
fuel
standard
a
law
that
requires
oil
refiners
to
mix
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
fuel
supply
or
buy
credits
from
other
energy
firms
who
do
the
blending
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
has
already
issued
an
unusually
high
hardship
waivers
to
small
refineries
in
recent
months
according
to
an
agency
source
driving
blending
credit
prices
down
and
helping
the
oil
industry
reduce
compliance
costs
but
the
agency
won
t
name
the
firms
receiving
the
exemptions
citing
a
concern
over
disclosing
private
company
information
both
chevron
and
exxon
among
the
world
s
most
profitable
energy
companies
have
asked
epa
for
waivers
for
their
smallest
facilities
chevron
s
refinery
in
utah
and
the
exxon
s
bpd
refinery
in
montana
two
sources
briefed
on
the
matter
told
reuters
on
condition
of
anonymity
the
exemptions
would
free
the
plants
from
their
obligation
to
hand
in
blending
credits
earned
or
purchased
for
which
came
due
this
year
the
sources
said
the
disclosure
of
the
chevron
and
exxon
applications
which
have
not
been
previously
reported
follow
a
reuters
report
this
month
that
the
epa
has
exempted
three
of
ten
refineries
owned
by
andeavor
one
of
the
biggest
refining
companies
the
waivers
could
save
andeavor
million
or
more
in
regulatory
costs
for
the
company
s
obligations
under
the
biofuels
law
husky
energy
a
canadian
oil
giant
backed
by
a
hong
kong
billionaire
will
also
be
seeking
an
exemption
this
one
covering
the
requirements
for
its
small
superior
wisconsin
plant
spokesman
mel
duval
told
reuters
disclosing
the
waiver
for
the
first
time
duval
said
husky
inherited
a
exemption
when
it
bought
the
bpd
superior
refinery
from
calumet
specialty
products
partners
for
million
in
november
the
waivers
are
intended
for
facilities
producing
less
than
barrels
per
day
bpd
that
can
also
prove
compliance
with
the
policy
would
cause
them
disproportionate
economic
a
spokesman
for
chevron
braden
reddall
declined
to
confirm
or
deny
the
application
but
said
waivers
provide
an
edge
several
competitors
have
reportedly
received
exemptions
from
the
rfs
he
said
in
a
written
statement
to
reuters
if
true
any
refinery
which
has
not
been
exempted
from
the
rfs
will
be
at
a
competitive
exxon
spokesman
dan
carter
declined
to
comment
the
exceptions
and
the
epa
s
refusal
to
disclose
them
have
infuriated
the
corn
lobby
which
argues
the
waivers
hurt
farmers
by
undermining
demand
for
corn
and
should
be
used
only
sparingly
for
tiny
facilities
in
dire
straits
epa
is
hiding
behind
poor
excuses
about
proprietary
business
information
to
shield
big
oil
companies
from
public
scrutiny
five
republican
senators
including
chuck
grassley
and
joni
ernst
from
iowa
wrote
in
a
joint
statement
thursday
this
looks
like
just
another
backdoor
attempt
by
epa
administrator
scott
pruitt
to
destroy
the
renewable
fuel
standard
and
circumvent
congressional
bob
dinneen
head
of
the
renewable
fuels
association
said
there
is
nothing
small
about
exxon
and
chevron
both
of
which
rank
in
the
top
of
the
fortune
for
these
two
behemoth
oil
companies
to
claim
economic
hardship
is
downright
offensive
and
insulting
to
the
farm
families
and
ethanol
producers
that
depend
on
the
rfs
dinneen
said
it
s
unclear
whether
the
epa
has
approved
the
exxon
or
chevron
application
epa
spokeswoman
liz
bowman
declined
to
comment
on
which
firms
have
applied
for
or
received
exemptions
she
said
the
agency
considers
any
application
to
exempt
a
refinery
of
less
than
bpd
regardless
of
the
size
of
the
company
that
owns
it
epa
decisions
on
waivers
are
based
on
information
she
said
in
an
email
we
continue
to
work
through
petitions
received
for
exxon
reported
net
profits
of
billion
last
year
chevron
reported
earning
billion
both
bill
themselves
as
globally
integrated
companies
and
neither
breaks
out
the
financial
details
for
their
individual
facilities
in
the
public
disclosures
they
are
required
to
file
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
republican
senator
john
barrasso
of
wyoming
home
to
several
small
refineries
praised
the
expansion
of
the
exemption
program
in
a
statement
on
thursday
he
did
not
address
the
controversy
over
the
exemptions
granted
to
some
of
the
nation
s
largest
refiners
i
applaud
administrator
pruitt
and
secretary
perry
for
recognizing
the
burdens
of
this
program
they
know
that
we
can
t
allow
it
to
hurt
our
nation
s
small
refineries
barrasso
said
the
epa
has
historically
doled
out
fewer
than
ten
hardship
exemptions
per
year
to
refineries
according
to
a
former
official
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
a
current
epa
official
however
said
the
number
reached
for
the
epa
has
come
under
pressure
for
being
stingy
with
the
waivers
in
the
past
a
successful
lawsuit
last
year
by
sinclair
oil
corporation
led
a
federal
court
to
order
epa
to
expand
its
definition
of
economic
hardship
opening
the
door
for
more
facilities
to
be
eligible
the
trump
administration
has
also
signaled
a
willingness
to
help
refining
companies
reduce
their
biofuels
compliance
costs
which
industry
players
say
has
encouraged
a
surge
in
recent
applications
trump
hosted
a
series
of
meetings
with
advocates
for
the
corn
and
oil
industries
at
the
white
house
since
late
last
year
aimed
at
reforming
biofuels
regulations
in
a
way
that
cuts
costs
for
refiners
without
reducing
overall
biofuels
demand
the
effort
failed
to
yield
a
deal
due
to
protests
from
corn
industry
representatives
obtaining
a
waiver
helps
refiners
in
two
ways
they
no
longer
have
to
earn
or
purchase
blending
credits
called
rins
to
prove
compliance
and
they
can
sell
any
rins
they
have
on
hand
into
the
open
market
that
can
provide
a
company
with
a
benefit
ranging
into
the
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
other
big
oil
companies
including
phillips
also
own
refineries
small
enough
to
be
eligible
for
a
waiver
as
does
cvr
energy
which
is
owned
by
billionaire
investor
and
trump
ally
carl
icahn
officials
for
those
companies
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
on
whether
they
are
seeking
exemptions
icahn
s
efforts
last
year
to
overhaul
the
biofuels
program
while
acting
as
an
adviser
to
trump
on
regulatory
issues
drew
scrutiny
from
federal
investigators
after
lawmakers
said
it
raised
ethical
concerns
biofuels
proponents
including
department
of
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
has
criticized
the
use
of
rfs
exemptions
as
demand
destruction
for
ethanol
ethanol
demand
has
been
vital
to
farmers
who
are
buffeted
by
low
commodities
prices
and
the
threat
of
a
global
trade
war
the
american
petroleum
institute
which
represents
big
oil
companies
like
exxon
and
chevron
has
also
opposed
small
refinery
exemptions
in
the
past
arguing
for
a
level
