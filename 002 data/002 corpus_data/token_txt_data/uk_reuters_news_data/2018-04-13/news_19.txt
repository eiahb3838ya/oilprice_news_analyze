alexei
miller
head
of
russian
gas
giant
gazprom
will
have
to
lower
his
public
profile
and
delegate
to
someone
else
his
powers
to
clinch
deals
and
raise
financing
now
that
he
has
been
added
to
a
sanctions
blacklist
analysts
said
washington
last
week
imposed
sanctions
against
several
russian
businessmen
companies
and
government
officials
striking
at
associates
of
president
vladimir
putin
to
punish
moscow
for
a
range
of
activities
including
alleged
meddling
in
the
election
while
gazprom
was
not
affected
miller
himself
was
added
to
the
nationals
list
which
bars
individuals
and
entities
from
having
any
dealings
with
him
firms
outside
jurisdiction
can
be
punished
if
washington
deems
they
are
helping
a
sanctioned
entity
it
is
possible
that
to
soothe
the
worries
of
the
european
partners
miller
will
have
to
delegate
his
powers
to
an
attorney
fitch
ratings
analyst
dmitry
marinchenko
said
gazprom
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
miller
said
last
week
he
was
proud
to
be
included
on
the
sanctions
list
gazprom
has
no
direct
with
firms
but
it
has
a
web
of
commercial
relationships
in
europe
where
it
supplies
around
a
third
of
the
bloc
s
natural
gas
needs
uniper
shell
engie
omv
and
wintershall
are
among
gazprom
s
key
european
partners
technically
speaking
unlike
for
persons
foreign
persons
from
the
eu
can
meet
and
negotiate
with
mr
miller
short
of
signing
anything
material
for
their
companies
and
gazprom
george
voloshin
from
aperio
intelligence
consultancy
in
paris
said
but
since
we
are
walking
a
very
fine
line
here
in
terms
of
jurisprudence
they
will
most
likely
prefer
the
safest
option
excluding
mr
miller
from
all
dealings
he
said
miller
worked
with
president
putin
in
the
st
petersburg
city
administration
in
the
early
when
putin
was
an
advisor
to
the
mayor
miller
has
been
at
the
helm
of
gazprom
since
gazprom
s
annual
investments
are
almost
trillion
roubles
billion
while
its
international
borrowings
total
around
trillion
roubles
the
largest
among
all
russian
companies
according
to
fitch
in
gazprom
will
have
to
redeem
billion
of
debt
roubles
