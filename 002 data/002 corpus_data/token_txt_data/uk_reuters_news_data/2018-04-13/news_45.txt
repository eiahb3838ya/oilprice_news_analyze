royal
dutch
shell
has
asked
indonesia
to
rethink
a
policy
allowing
the
government
to
control
domestic
fuel
pricing
a
company
official
said
an
area
fundamental
to
its
fuel
distribution
business
indonesia
s
ministry
of
energy
and
mineral
resources
announced
on
monday
that
president
joko
widodo
wanted
to
issue
rules
allowing
the
government
to
regulate
fuel
prices
to
control
inflation
fuel
prices
are
currently
set
by
retailers
but
under
a
planned
regulation
the
government
would
have
the
right
to
decide
whether
retailers
can
change
fuel
prices
shell
operated
in
many
countries
and
understood
government
concerns
related
to
the
impacts
of
increasing

director

indrawanto
said
in
an
emailed
statement
reviewed
by
reuters
late
on
thursday
shell
had
observed
several
alternative
policies
to
control
inflation
and
had
passed
them
on
to
the
government
hoping
this
can
be
given
further
consideration
indrawanto
said
in
principle
certainty
of
being
able
to
sell
consumer
fuel
at
economic
prices
is
fundamental
to
maintaining
an
investment
climate
and
sustainability
in
shell

fuel
distribution
business
indrawanto
said
finance
minister
sri
mulyani
indrawati
said
on
thursday
that
maintaining
commodity
supplies
and
prices
were
important
elements
in
maintaining
low
and
stable
inflation
to
keep
indonesian
economic
growth
above
percent
indonesia
was
not
going
back
to
what
we
call
a
practice
that
is
going
to
subsidise
everything
or
in
this
case
curtailing
the
market
mechanisms
indrawati
said
in
response
to
questions
on
the
subsidy
policy
at
a
press
conference
of
course
just
like
in
transport
there
is
always
healthy
and
competition
excessive
profit
and
the
fuel
pricing
policy
would
follow
an
existing
rule
on
the
retail
fuel
sector
that
governed
pricing
and
operations
she
added
we
are
focussing
on
enforcement
and
policy
instruments
that
can
protect
our
people
s
confidence
that
our
economy
is
growing
and
that
we
can
guard
against
external
fluctuations
be
it
oil
prices
fed
interest
rates
or
a
trade
war
indrawati
told
reporters
separately
while
attending
meetings
at
the
parliament
president
joko
widodo
won
international
praise
and
sovereign
bond
rating
upgrades
for
southeast
asia
s
largest
economy
after
cutting
government
fuel
spending
by
more
than
percent
and
shifting
the
burden
of
petroleum
subsidies
to
pertamina
shortly
after
taking
office
in
but
the
latest
energy
policies
contrast
with
widodo
s
earlier
moves
to
eliminate
subsidies
and
have
raised
concerns
among
some
economists
net
oil
importer
indonesia
s
fuel
subsidies
have
been
blamed
for
creating
a
false
economy
