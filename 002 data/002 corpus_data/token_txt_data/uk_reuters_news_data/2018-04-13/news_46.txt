world
stocks
and
commodities
rose
on
friday
with
stocks
set
to
post
their
biggest
weekly
gain
in
over
a
month
as
investors
seemed
to
shrug
off
the
uncertainty
over
tension
in
the
middle
east
and
the
prospect
of
a
global
trade
war
global
stock
markets
have
had
a
whipsaw
week
largely
fuelled
by
president
donald
trump
s
tendency
to
change
his
mind
over
key
policy
and
political
issues
the
msci
world
index
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
was
up
nearly
percent
on
the
day
it
has
gained
nearly
percent
this

best
weekly
showing
since

european
bourses
opened
positive
with
the

index
on
track
for
its
third
straight
week
of
gains
its
longest
winning
streak
since
january
the
beginnings
of

results
were
largely
positive
though
misses
were
badly
punished
earlier
in
asia
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
was
up
a
slim
percent
still
up
about
percent
on
the
week
overall
friday
s
performance
in
stocks
seemed
to
suggest
investors
were
relieved
at
apparent
suggestions
from
trump
that
a
military
strike
on
syria
may
not
be
imminent
however
the
threat
of
a
strike
remained
after
washington
s
earlier
warnings
against
the
syrian
government
for
what
is
said
was
a
suspected
poison
gas
attack
on
its
civilians
it
would
be
na√Øve
in
the
extreme
to
suggest
that
the
events
of
the
last
hours
means
that
the
threat
of
an
escalation
of
geopolitical
factors
has
passed
said
michael
hewson
chief
markets
analyst
at
cmc
markets
in
london
but
for
now
while
the
background
noise
is
driving
the
direction
as
markets
gyrate
higher
and
lower
recent
price
action
might
suggest
that
we
could
look
to
head
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
trading
range
in
the
coming
days
particularly
if
earnings
come
in
ahead
of
the
earnings

in

on

for

companies
to

from

in
what
would
be
the
biggest
gain
in

years
according
to

investors
had
other
reasons
to
fret
however
mixed
data
from
china
showed
march
exports
unexpectedly
fell
percent
from
a
year
earlier
while
imports
jumped
more
than
forecast
while
the
figures
pointed
to
robust
demand
from
the
world
s
top
consumer
of
crude
copper
and
iron
ore
they
left
the
country
with
a
rare
trade
deficit
of

for
the

the
first
since
last
february
trade
tensions
also
were
not
far
from
the
surface
with
analysts
at
citi
noting
prolonged
uncertainty
will
likely
hurt
open
asian
economies
such
as
taiwan
singapore
and
south
korea
in
the
most
recent
change
of

trump
thursday
asked
his
advisers
to
look
at
the
trans
pacific
partnership
a
multinational
trade
pact
he
withdrew
the
united
states
from
early
last
year
but
he
later
tweeted
that
the
united
states
would
only
join
the
tpp
if
the
deal
were
substantially
better
than
the
one
offered
to
former

barack

the
return
of
risk
appetite
also
played
out
in
the
currencies

a
