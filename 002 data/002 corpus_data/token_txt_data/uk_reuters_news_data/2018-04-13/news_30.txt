reuters
britain
s
biggest
carmaker
jaguar
land
rover
will
cut
around
jobs
and
production
at
two
of
its
english
factories
due
to
a
fall
in
sales
caused
by
uncertainty
around
brexit
and
confusion
over
diesel
policy
a
source
told
reuters
output
will
be
cut
at
its
central
english
solihull
and
castle
bromwich
plants
affecting
some
agency
workers
the
source
said
a
spokesman
at
jaguar
land
rover
jlr
declined
to
comment
on
the
number
of
jobs
which
would
be
lost
but
the
firm
said
it
would
be
making
changes
to
its
output
plans
in
light
of
the
continuing
headwinds
impacting
the
car
industry
we
are
making
some
adjustments
to
our
production
schedules
and
the
level
of
agency
staff
the
company
said
in
a
statement
it
is
not
renewing
the
contracts
of
a
number
of
agency
staff
at
the
solihull
site
and
would
be
informing
staff
on
monday
of
its
plans
for
the
financial
year
in
january
the
firm
said
it
would
temporarily
reduce
production
at
its
other
british
plant
of
halewood
later
this
year
in
response
to
weakening
demand
due
to
brexit
and
tax
hikes
on
diesel
cars
but
did
not
detail
any
job
losses
jaguar
sales
are
down
percent
so
far
this
year
whilst
land
rover
demand
dropped
percent
in
its
home
market
as
buyers
shun
diesel
concerned
over
planned
tax
rises
and
possible
bans
and
restrictions
in
several
countries
it
s
been
obvious
to
everyone
that
sales
have
been
dropping
the
source
said
british
new
car
registrations
have
been
falling
for
a
year
which
the
car
industry
body
has
partly
blamed
on
weakening
consumer
confidence
in
the
wake
of
the
brexit
vote
after
record
demand
