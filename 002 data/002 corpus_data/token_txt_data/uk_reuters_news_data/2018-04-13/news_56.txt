china
s
march
crude
oil
imports
climbed
from
a
month
earlier
to
the
second
highest
on
record
calculated
on
a

as
refiners
replenished
stocks
on
generous
government
quotas

ahead
of

shipments
came
in
at
million

or
million
barrels

the
general
administration
of
customs
said
on
friday
that
compared
with
million
bpd
in
february
and
january
s
record
million
bpd
imports
for
the
first
quarter
grew
percent
from
a
year
ago
to
million
tonnes
or
about
million
bpd
that
marked
an
increase
of
nearly
bpd
on
average
compared
with
the
same
period
in
the
growth
was
fueled
by
higher
government
quotas
for
independent
plants
but
a
new
tax
regulation
targeted
at
small
refiners
and
blenders
as
well
as
planned
plant
overhauls
is
seen
capping
buying
for
april
and
may
independents
remain
the
largest
contributors
to
the
imports
growth
we
estimate
their
imports
expanded
at
percent
in
the
first
quarter

yick

sia
energy
the
commissioning
of
the
expanded
east
siberia
pacific
ocean
espo
pipeline
petrochina
s
newly
commissioned
yunnan
refinery
and
cnooc
s
new
huizhou
plant
also
contributed
growth
tee
added
at
least
three
large
refineries
have
kicked
off
major
maintenance
that
will
last
days
between
april
and
may
the
three
plants
sinopec
s
zhenhai
and
petrochina
s
sichuan
and
jilin
have
a
combined
daily
processing
capacity
of
bpd
and
will
reduce
china
s
imports
from
saudi
arabia
kazakhstan
and
russia
four
independent
refineries
with
a
combined
capacity
of
bpd
also
started
maintenance
this
month
analysts
said
that
was
in
part
triggered
by
a
new
consumption
tax
regulation
as
crude
oil
prices
have
risen
friday
s
customs
data
also
showed
china
s
march
refined
fuel
exports
shot
to
a
new
high
at
million
tonnes
percent
higher
than
the
same
month
a
year
earlier
imports
only
inched
up
percent
at
million
tonnes
state
refiners
have
stepped
up
exports
to
help
cope
with
a
growing
surplus
of
refined
barrels
in
one
example
sinopec
is
lining
up
its
third
very
large
crude
carrier
vlcc
shipment
of
diesel
from
china
to
europe
or
west
africa
people
familiar
with
the
matter
said
even
in
large
shipments
exports
are
not
profitable
but
it
helped
bolster
domestic
margins
said
one
official
with
a
refiner
who
declined
to
be
identified
because
he
wasn
t
authorised

discuss
the
