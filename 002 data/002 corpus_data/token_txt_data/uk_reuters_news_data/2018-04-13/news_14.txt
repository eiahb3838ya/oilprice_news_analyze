in

added
to

scott
brown
chief
economist
at
raymond
james
in
petersburg
florida
said
stock
prices
have
taken
in
much
of
the
heightened
expectations
on
earnings
this
has
not
been
the
typical
season
where
you
re
talking
down
expectations
there
is
some
potential
for
disappointment
at
the
same
time
there
is
also
lot

tax
cuts
are
expected
to

corporate
america
post
its

global
investors
seemed
to
focus
on
the
lack
of
a
clear
sign
that
any
attack
on
syria
was
imminent
but
the
prospect
of
western
military
action
in
syria
that
could
lead
to
confrontation
with
russia
hung
over
the
middle
east
oil
prices
rose
and
were
headed
for
their
largest
weekly
gain
since
july
on
support
from
lingering
concerns
about
geopolitical
risk
and
reports
of
dwindling
global
oil
stocks
the
geopolitical
jitters
just
keep
getting
priced
in
here
more
and
more
as
we
get
closer
to
the
moment
of
the
strikes
if
there
are
any
said
john
kilduff
partner
at
hedge
fund
again
capital
management
he
noted
that
syria
poses
a
large
risk
to
global
stability
because
of
its
relationship
with
powerful
oil
producers
syria
is
a
client
state
of
both
russia
and
iran
and
the
risk
for
escalation
is
quite
high
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
market
is
worried
crude

percent
to
per
barrel

brent
