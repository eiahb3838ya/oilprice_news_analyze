update 3-massachusetts top court rules against exxon in climate change probe
boston
reuters
massachusetts
top
court
on
friday
rejected
exxon
mobil
corp
s
bid
to
block
the
state
s
attorney
general
from
obtaining
records
to
investigate
whether
the
company
for
decades
concealed
its
knowledge
of
the
role
fossil
fuels
play
in
climate
change
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
ruled
attorney
general
maura
healey
had
jurisdiction
to
seek
records
to
probe
whether
the
oil
company
s
marketing
or
sale
of
fossil
fuel
products
violated
the
state
s
consumer
protection
law
the
ruling
marked
another
setback
for
exxon
after
a
federal
judge
in
march
dismissed
a
related
lawsuit
it
filed
seeking
to
block
investigations
by
healey
and
new
york
attorney
general
eric
schneiderman
both
of
whom
are
democrats
exxon
argued
that
because
it
is
incorporated
in
texas
and
new
jersey
healey
had
no
basis
to
issue
a
demand
for
documents
in
to
conduct
a
investigation
of
whether
it
misled
consumers
and
investors
but
justice
elspeth
cypher
writing
for
a
court
said
jurisdiction
existed
because
of
exxon
s
control
over
advertising
conducted
for
about
franchise
gas
stations
operating
under
the
exxon
and
mobil
brands
in
massachusetts
she
said
healey
s
probe
related
to
how
manmade
greenhouse
gas
emissions
had
caused
climate
change
a
distinctly
modern
threat
that
grows
more
serious
with
time
and
the
effects
of
which
are
already
being
felt
in
healey
said
she
hoped
exxon
would
now
turn
over
documents
it
has
fought
hard
against
disclosing
showing
what
it
knew
about
climate
change
and
when
it
knew
it
i
hope
this
decision
will
encourage
exxon
to
end
their
scorched
earth
campaign
she
said
scott
silvestri
a
spokesman
for
exxon
said
the
company
was
considering
its
next
steps
healey
and
schneiderman
launched
their
investigations
following
news
reports
in
saying
exxon
s
own
scientists
determined
that
fossil
fuel
combustion
must
be
reduced
to
mitigate
the
impact
of
climate
change
those
reports
by
insideclimate
news
and
the
los
angeles
times
were
based
on
documents
from
the
and
exxon
contended
that
the
documents
were
not
inconsistent
with
its
public
positions
exxon
has
called
the
investigations
politically
motivated
and
in
a
separate
lawsuit
filed
in
federal
court
claimed
that
schneiderman
and
healey
were
conspiring
to
silence
and
intimidate
one
side
of
the
public
policy
but
district
judge
valerie
caproni
in
manhattan
dismissed
that
case
in
march
rejecting
as
implausible
exxons
claim
healey
and
schneiderman
were
pursuing
bad
faith
investigations
in
order
to
violate
its
constitutional
rights
