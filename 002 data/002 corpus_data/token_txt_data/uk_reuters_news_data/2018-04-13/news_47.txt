opec
appears
to
be
reformulating
its
target
in
terms
of
upstream
investment
rather
than
oil
inventories
according
to
an
analysis
of
recent
statements
made
by
ministers
from

countries
there
is
no
such
thing
as

we
re
seeing
production
in
many

declining
the
only
way
to
offset
this
is
for
the

start
financing
and
funding
upstream

i

all
we

not

falih
s
comments
suggest
the

is
now
targeting
a
sustainable
level
of
exploration
and

will
have
to
rise
further
to
incentivise

the

attached
to

comments
made
by
other

from
the

of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
in
recent
weeks
we
will
know
we
have
a
good

when
the

is
balanced
and
we
have
enough

we

there
has

it

low
reuters
april
the
emphasis
on
investment
stands
in
marked
contrast
to
the
previous
focus
on
reducing
oil
inventories
in
the
oecd
industrialised
countries
to
the
average
almost
the
single
metric
that
we
look
at
is
global
inventories
and
of
course
the
most
transparent
and
trustworthy
is
the
oecd
inventories
falih
said
as
recently
as
december
the
recent
shift
from
inventories
to
investment
is
consistent
across
multiple
ministers
which
suggests
it
is
the
result
of
private
discussions
within
opec
focusing
on
investment
is
not
new
for
the
organisation
the
need
for
prices
high
enough
to
support
sustainable
investment
in
production
has
been
acknowledged
since
opec
was
created
opec
s
founding
statute
approved
in
commits
the
organisation
to
stabilising
prices
securing
a
steady
income
for
producing
countries
and
ensuring
a
fair
return
on
capital
to
investors
in
the
petroleum
industry
opec
members
have
often
stated
the
need
for
security
of
demand
and
for
prices
to
be
high
enough
to
justify
investment
in
new
capacity
as
a
practical
matter
the
overriding
target
for
opec
members
has
always
been
to
maximise
government
revenues
from
the
sale
of
petroleum
but
the
organisation
has
rarely
stated
its
objective
so
bluntly
and
has
normally
preferred
to
declare
a
less
controversial
intermediate
or
operational
target
such
as
tax
rates
sustainable
investment
inventories
or
price
stability
in
the
early
years
opec
began
by
focusing
on
raising
royalties
and
tax
rates
then
increasing
prices
and
obtaining
equity
ownership
of
oil
production
by
the
early
opec
members
had
obtained
complete
ownership
of
production
on
their
territories
and
the
focus
shifted
more
explicitly
to
revenue
maximisation
since
that
time
opec
has
alternated
regularly
between
trying
to
raise
prices
and
trying
to
protect
its
market
share
against
rivals
in
the
most
recent
cycle
opec
focused
on
maintaining
prices
above
per
barrel
between
and
the
middle
of
from
to
opec
switched
to
defending
market
share
against
competition
from
shale
and
other
producers
and
was
prepared
to
allow
prices
to
slump
to
protect
its
exports
since
the
end
of
opec
s
priority
has
reverted
to
raising
prices
and
it
has
been
willing
to
sacrifice
some
market
share
to
attain
that
goal
average
in
the
early
stages
of
its
current
strategy
opec
formulated
its
goal
in
terms
of
the
need
to
reduce
excess
inventories
that
had
built
up
during
the
slump
higher
prices
were
merely
an
incidental
benefit
of
cutting
stockpiles
back
towards
the
average
at
least
in
theory
in
practice
higher
prices
and
revenues
have
been
the
main
benefit
of
the
strategy
with
benchmark
brent
prices
increasing
from
to
since
opec
announced
it
would
cut
production
inventories
are
now
close
to
the
average
and
have
actually
fallen
below
it
in
terms
of
forward
cover
but
opec
members
still
appear
to
want
to
continue
curbing
output
and
raising
prices
so
the
inventory
target
has
been
swapped
for
an
investment
objective
to
justify
continued
production
restraint
saudi
officials
remain
coy
about
the
kingdom
s
target
for
oil
prices
and
the
energy
minister
has
flatly
denied
there
is
one
but
the
kingdom
s
comments
and
supply
behaviour
suggest
it
is
reasonable
to
infer
that
it
has
an
undeclared
target
of
around
per
barrel
saudi
arabia

bloomberg
april
prices
around
would
balance
the
kingdom
s
budget
help
pay
for
the
government
s
ambitious
reform
programme
and
make
it
easier
to
achieve
a
notional
trillion
valuation
when
shares
in
state
oil
producer
saudi
aramco
are
sold
opec
s
ambitions
for
prices
have
steadily
increased
from
around
to
and
now
over
the
last
months
based
on
comments
made
by
ministers
and
other
senior
officials
the
escalation
in
the
organisation
s
price
target
fits
a
familiar
pattern
in
which
the
more
prices
rise
the
more
opec
hopes
they
will
increase
further
for
opec
members
the
sustainable
equilibrium
price
is
almost
always
at
least
higher
than
the
current
price
but
by
chasing
higher
prices
the
organisation
risks
increasing
rival
supplies
from
shale
and
other
producers
as
well
as
slower
growth
in
oil
consumption
opec
members
have
said
they
want
to
see
more
investment
but
that
implies
higher
output
from
shale
as
well
as
other
sources
before
prices
dropped
in
june
the
problem
was
too
much
investment
which
had
caused
excessive
supply
growth
and
created
the
conditions
for
the
slump
by
pushing
for
higher
prices
opec
may
be
on
the
verge
of
making
the
same
mistake
