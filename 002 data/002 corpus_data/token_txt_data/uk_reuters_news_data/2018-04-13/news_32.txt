most
profitable

but
its
huge
earnings

still
fail
to
justify
its
desired
trillion
valuation
financial
performance
at
aramco
has
long
been
one
of
the
best
kept
secrets
in

but
as
the
company
prepares
for
a
initial
public

needs
to
tell

what
it
earns

how
it
operates

saying
aramco
had
net

billion
in
the

bloomberg
said
saudi
arabia

prince
mohammed
bin
salman
who
has
made
the
aramco
ipo
a
cornerstone
of
saudi
economic

to
wants
to
raise
a
record
billion
by
selling
a
percent
stake
in
aramco
on
local
and
foreign
exchanges
that
would
give
aramco
a
market
capitalization
of
trillion
the
biggest
achieved
by
any
company
and
dwarfing
peers
such
as
exxon
mobil
and
royal
dutch
shell
by
comparison
shell
s
current
cost
of
supplies
earnings
excluding
the
closest
equivalent
to
net
income
stood
at
billion
in
the
first
half
of
the
same
as
exxon
s
exxon
had
cash
flow
from
operations
and
asset
sales
at

in
the
first
half
of
compared
with
shell
cash
flows
of
billion
exxon
s
current
market
capitalization
stands
at
billion
and
shell
is
worth
billion
even
though
aramco
s
cash
flows
are
two
to
three
times
bigger
its
desire
for
a
market
value
six
to
seven
times
higher
than
those
of
exxon
or
shell
might
look
too
ambitious
to
many
investors
and
analysts
who
have
said
the
company
could
be
worth
more
than
trillion
