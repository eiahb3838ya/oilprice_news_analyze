update 1-iea says "mission accomplished" for opec as oil stocks shrink
london
reuters
opec
and
its
allies
appear
to
have
accomplished
their
mission
of
reducing
global
oil
stocks
to
desired
levels
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
friday
signalling
that
the
market
could
become
too
tight
if
supply
remains
restrained
the
iea
which
coordinates
the
energy
policies
of
industrialised
nations
said
stocks
in
developed
countries
could
fall
to
their
average
a
metric
used
by
opec
to
measure
the
success
of
output
cuts
as
early
as
may
it
is
not
for
us
to
declare
on
behalf
of
the
vienna
agreement
countries
that
it
is
mission
accomplished
but
if
our
outlook
is
accurate
it
certainly
looks
very
much
like
it
the
iea
said
in
its
monthly
report
opec
has
reduced
production
in
tandem
with
russia
and
other
allies
since
january
to
prop
up
oil
prices
which
soared
above
per
barrel
this
month
giving
a
new
boost
to
booming
output

shale

as
oil
production
has
collapsed
in
opec
member
venezuela
and
still
faces
hiccups
in
peers
such
as
libya
and
angola
the
oil
exporter
group
is
producing
below
its
targets
meaning
the
world
needs
to
use
stocks
to
meet
rising
demand
on
thursday
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
said
in
a
monthly
report
that
oil
stocks
in
the
developed
world
were
only
million
barrels
above
the
latest
average
the
iea
put
the
figure
at
just
million
barrels
as
of
the
end
of
february
the
iea
said
that
even
though
output
was
set
to
soar
by
million
barrels
per
day
this
year
on
higher
production
it
was
not
enough
to
meet
global
demand
expected
to
rise
by
million
bpd
or
around
percent
opec
was
producing
million
bpd
in
march
below
the
call
on
its
crude
for
the
rest
of
the
year
at
million
bpd
our
balances
show
that
if
opec
production
were
constant
this
year
and
if
our
outlooks
for
production
and
oil
demand
remain
unchanged
in
global
stocks
could
draw
by
about
million
bpd
the
iea
said
the
figure
would
represent
percent
of
global
supply
or
around
half
of
opec
s
current
production
cuts
of
nearly
million
bpd
the
pact
runs
until
the
opec
meets
in
june
to
decide
its
next
steps
the
organisation
s
de
facto
leader
saudi
arabia
has
said
it
would
like
the
agreement
to
extend
into
opec
mohammad
barkindo
told
reuters
on
thursday
opec
and
its
allies
were
poised
to
extend
the
pact
into
next
year
even
as
a
glut
of
crude
should
evaporate
by
september
opec
is
within
rapid
reach
of
its
first
announced
goals
and
will
have
to
come
up
with
a
new
metric
for
the
june
meeting
if
it
wants
the
agreement
to
last
into
the
second
half
of
the
year
said
olivier
jakob
from
petromatrix
consultancy
qatar
s
energy
minister
told
reuters
last
week
that
even
though
stocks
around
the
world
were
falling
an
investment
drought
continued
to
afflict
the
oil
industry
and
hence
the
price
of
crude
could
spike
in
the
long
run
reuters
market
analyst
john
kemp
argues
that
recent
statements
from
opec
members
indicate
the
organisation
appears
to
be
reformulating
its
target
in
terms
of
upstream
investment
rather
than
inventories
