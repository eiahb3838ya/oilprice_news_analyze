executive
said
adding
that
a
first
deepwater

in
an
existing

will
likely
be
drilled
next

statoil
is
focused
mostly
on
future
deepwater

in
mexico
but
does
not
rule
out
others
ceo

saetre
said
in
an
interview
late
on
thursday
the
executive
visiting
mexico
city
with
norwegian
prime
minister
erna
solberg
said
he
met
with
both
finance
ministry
and
pemex
officials
we
will
look
for
further
opportunities
that
might
come
from
ordinary
licensing
rounds
or
through
portfolio
management
from
pemex
s
portfolio
he
said
without
giving
further
details
statoil
one
of
the
world
s
largest
deepwater
operators
won
stakes
in
two
gulf
of
mexico
projects
in
mexican
waters
at
a
licensing
round
in
late
with
partners
bp
and
total
saetre
said
the
first
deepwater
exploration
well
at
the
block
in
the
gulf
s
salina
basin
will
likely
be
drilled
in
adding
that
company
aimed
to
get
into
such
frontier
opportunities
very
owned
by
norway
s
government
statoil
has
offshore
oil
and
gas
projects
spread
across
latin
america
including
partnerships
with
brazil
s
petrobras
asked
why
statoil
has
entered
equity
partnerships
with
petrobras
but
not
pemex
saetre
said
brazil
has
been
open
to
foreign
producers
much
longer
it
s
very
early
days
in
mexico
when
it
comes
to
industrial
activities
and
upstream
activities
he
said
referring
to
a
mexican
oil
sector
opening
enacted
in
we
relate
quite
easily
to
companies
like
pemex
and
understand
where
they
come
from
so
it
s
a
very
good
discussion
said
saetre
who
has
served
in
various
roles
at
statoil
since
he
downplayed
any
future
political
risk
of
operating
in
mexico
which
many
sector
analysts
see
increasing
as
the
in
the
july
presidential
election
leftist
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
has
pledged
to
review
all
contracts
and
put
the
oil
opening
to
a
public
vote
stability
and
continuity
is
really
important
in
the
industry
but
we
are
here
to
have
dialogues
with
whoever
is
in
power
saetre
said
the
energy
reform
ended
pemex
s
monopoly
and
allowed
foreign
and
private
producers
to
operate
projects
alone
for
the
first
time
while
saetre
described
the
offshore
upstream
business
as
most
appealing
he
said
midstream
projects
including
energy
infrastructure
or
retail
fuel
ventures
could
be
of
interest
if
it
helped
unlock
exploration
and
production
work
we
might
do
that
he
said
we
ve
done
that
in
many
places
but
not
in
its
own
