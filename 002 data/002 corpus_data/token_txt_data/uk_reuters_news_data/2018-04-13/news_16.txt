not
looking
to
challenge
fines
if

goals
but

do
more
to

them
hit

the

of
the
main
industry
lobby
group
said
the
decline
of
diesel
long
used

is
hampering

of
a
suspension
of
penalties
for
failing

jonnaert
said
no
this
is
an
idea
but
it
not
something
which
we
as
a
sector
are
currently
pushing
we
rather
want
to
link
the
challenges
and
issues
we
are
facing
now
to
meet
the
targets
to
the
discussion
on
the
how
the
future
will
look
like
instead
of
challenging
the

told
reuters
on
the

of
an
automotive
conference
in
prague
that
the
targets
were
challenging
but
the
car
sector
was
committed
to
meeting
them
what
we
are
questioning
in
this
is
there
are
no
targets
for
countries
he
said
we
are
asked
to
meet
targets
but
the
countries
are

greenhouse
gases
from

to
help
ensure
automakers
start
investments
early
acea
is
seeking
a
reduction
of
percent
overall
jonnaert
said
eu
governments
needed
to
help
the
industry
by
creating
incentives
for
consumers
to
use
electric
cars
in
addition
to
building
up
the
network
to
power
them
he
also
underlined
a
warning
from
psa
s
tavares
that
a
chinese
buyer
could
to
step
in
with
its
own
electric
vehicle
technology
if
european
companies
were
crippled
by
fines
it
is
not
just
a
phantom
idea
jonnaert
said
noting
the
auto
industry
employs
million
workers
in
europe
there
is
rising
concern
about
foreign
influence
over
european
manufacturers
jobs
and
technology
which
have
escalated
since
