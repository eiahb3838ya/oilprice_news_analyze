china
will
likely
increase
the
pace
of
its
strategic
oil
purchases
by
nearly
percent
this
year
compared
with
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
friday
and
its
eagerness
to
build
stocks
could
get
a
boost
from
trade
tensions
with
the
united
states
the
world
s
top
oil
importer
has
spent
the
past
years
creating
what
the
iea
called
the
world
s
most
ambitious
strategic
crude
reserves
programme
since
the
but
its
purchasing
pace
slid
by
half
last
year
the
iea
said
slowed
by
technical
problems
and
reduced
urgency
in
an
era
of
plentiful
supply
in
the
iea
said
it
expects
the
amount
of
oil
flowing
to
these
sites
to
rise
by
million
barrels
or
barrels
per
day
bpd
up
by
roughly
percent
from
s
fill
of
million
barrels
the
urgency
to
build
and
fill
sites
after
this
year
could
get
a
fillip
the
iea
said
from
the
growing
rift
between
china
and
the
united
states
a
newly
important
oil
exporter
whose
president
donald
trump
has
angered
china
by
threatening
to
impose
billions
of
dollars
in
trade
tariffs
if
current
trade
tensions
between
the
and
china
were
to
escalate
and
given
that
the
is
a
growing
supplier
of
crude
to
chinese
refiners
it
is
possible
that
the
spr
strategic
petroleum
reserve
programme
will
benefit
from
renewed
impetus
the
iea
said
china
s
oil
buying
plans
and
the
level
of
crude
stored
in
strategic
sites
dotted
across
the
nation
are
closely
watched
by
the
oil
industry
as
a
signal
of
how
much
more
the
key
consumer
is
likely
to
absorb
the
country
s
march
imports
hit
million
bpd
the
second
highest
on
record
with
imports
percent
higher
at
roughly
million
bpd
but
information
on
strategic
stocks
is
shrouded
in
secrecy
with
government
reports
on
the
fill
level
coming
only
with
several
months
lag
and
the
iea
said
the
latest
report
did
not
include
all
the
sites
that
are
part
of
the
programme
iea
estimates
showed
china
s
strategic
reserves
at
million
barrels
at
the
end
of
putting
them
at
percent
of
the
government
s
million
barrel
target
for
the
first
three
phases
of
purchasing
set
in
it
added
that
stocks
at
tianjin
phase
drew
last
year
and
that
information
from

analytics
company
kayrros
showed
that
cnpc
s
dushanzi
reserve
also
drew
to
of
its
capacity
during
the

s
reporting
