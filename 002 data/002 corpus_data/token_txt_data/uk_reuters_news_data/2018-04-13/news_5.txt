the
lineup
of
vessels
to
load
sugar
in
brazil
currently
is
around
percent
smaller
than
seen
in
the
same
period
a
year
earlier
because
of
lower
output
and
tepid
foreign
demand
midway
through
the
first
month
of
the
country
s
new
cane
crop
ten
vessels
were
at
brazilian
ports
in
the
first
week
of
april
to
load
tonnes
of
sugar
according
to
data
from
shipping
agency
williams
at
this
time
last
year
ships
were
at
port
to
take
on
tonnes
the
main
reason
for
that
is
the
smaller
production
in
brazil
said
julio
maria
borges
a
sugar
analyst
at
consultancy
job

e
planejamento
we
are
going
to
see
lineups
smaller
than
last
year
during
the
brazilian
mills
have
been
producing
much
more
ethanol
as
this
year
s
cane
crop
begins
than
seen
last
year
as
the
fuel
is
currently
more
profitable
than
sugar
and
demand
for
ethanol
in
brazil
is
strong
at
the
same
time
borges
says
mills
are
avoiding
closing
large
export
deals
as
international
sugar
prices
remain
low
brazil
the
world
s
largest
producer
and
exporter
of
sugar
is
finding
increasing
competition
abroad
as
europe
thailand
and
india
boost
output
michael
mcdougall
vice
president
at
ed
f
man
capital
markets
in
new
york
says
china
s
tariff
increase
on
sugar
instituted
last
year
is
also
hurting
brazil
volumes
brazil
s
cane
industry
group
unica
said
exports
to
china
which
in
the
past
would
amount
to
around
million
tonnes
per
year
reached
only
tonnes
last
season
because
of
the
restriction
china
in
may
last
year
started
to
charge
a
percent
duty
on
top
of
percent
tariff
it
already
had
in
place
for
sugar
imports
beyond
a
quota
of
million
tonnes
that
applies
to
many
countries
including
brazil
an
increase
in
white
sugar
production
in
europe
also
weighed
on
premiums
for
that
category
compared
with
raw
sugar
leading
to
lower
demand
from
refiners
for
raw
product
