shanghai
reuters
a
major
smog
indicator
in
china
s
heavy
industrial
region
rose
by
more
than
a
quarter
in
march
the
ministry
of
ecology
and
environment
said
on
friday
raising
concerns
that
pollution
is
increasing
with
the
end
of
winter
output
restrictions
concentrations
of
particulate
matter
of
less
than
microns
known
as
climbed
to
micrograms
per
cubic
metre
in
the
region
last
month
an
increase
of
percent
from
a
year
ago
the
ministry
said
the
region
includes
china
s
capital
and
tangshan
the
world
s
largest
steel
producing
city
a
campaign
that
ended
on
march
required
chinese
cities
to
reduce
levels
by
as
much
as
percent
by
slashing
industrial
output
restricting
traffic
and
cutting
coal
use
during
the
first
quarter
the
levels
of
in
the
region
which
has
been
under
heavy
political
pressure
to
tackle
pollution
dropped
percent
to
micrograms
per
cubic
metre
down
from
near
record
highs
in
the
same
period
of
last
year
that
indicates
the
output
cuts
were
working
as
intended
but
their
expiration
has
increased
concerns
that
pollution
levels
are
rebounding
as
factories
freed
from
restrictions
ramp
up
output
nationwide
during
the
first
quarter
concentrations
fell
percent
from
a
year
ago
to
micrograms
per
cubic
metre
in
the
cities
monitored
by
the
ministry
however
in
march
average
concentrations
climbed
percent
from
the
year
before
to
micrograms
per
cubic
metre
seven
of
china
s
most
polluted
cities
in
march
were
in
hebei
province
china
s
biggest
steel
producing
region
tangshan
and
the
city
of
handan
have
already
decided
to
extend
the
winter
curbs
until
november
however
xuzhou
an
industrial
city
in
eastern
china
s
jiangsu
province
was
also
on
the
list
of
the
smoggiest
cities
in
march
and
during
the
first
quarter
a
sign
that
china
s
smog
is
shifting
from
its
northern
heartlands
as
a
result
of
the
crackdown
the
yangtze
river
delta
region
which
comprises
jiangsu
zhejiang
and
anhui
provinces
and
the
city
of
shanghai
saw
levels
fall
percent
in
march
but
average
levels
rose
percent
in
the
first
quarter
as
a
whole
china
is
currently
working
on
a
new
action
plan
to
tackle
pollution
and
experts
have
urged
the
government
to
introduce
more
targeted
measures
to
tackle
rising
ozone
which
has
become
a
growing
urban
health
threat
chinese
authorities
are
working
to
reduce
concentrations
because
the
small
size
of
the
particles
allows
them
to
be
inhaled
deep
into
the
lungs
and
their
accumulation
eventually
can
cause
lung
and
heart
disorders
