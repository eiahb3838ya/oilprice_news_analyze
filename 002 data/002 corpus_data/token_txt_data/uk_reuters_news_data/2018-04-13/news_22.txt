interview-tiny marshall islands wields outsized clout for climate action

ships
carrying
goods
around
the
world
produce
more
than
percent
of
the
world
s
emissions
as
much
as
germany
the
european
union
says
but
shippers
much
like
aviation
companies
until
now
have
not
had
to
set
clear
targets
to
slash
those
emissions
that
changed
friday
as
the
international
maritime
organization
meeting
in
london
agreed
a
first
strategy
to
cut
emissions
in
part
as
a
result
of
pressure
from
tiny
remote
nations
such
as
the
marshall
islands
the
country
s
atolls
are
hugely
vulnerable
to
sea
level
rise
from
climate
change
it
is
heavily
dependent
on
shipping
percent
of
its
food
arrives
that
way
and
it
is
home
to
the
world
s
second
biggest
ship
registry
behind
panama
that
meant
we
had
a
very
unique
opportunity
to
shape
the
outcome
of
negotiations
said
david
paul
the
marshall
islands
environment
minister
we
are
by
far
dependent
almost
entirely
on
shipping
one
way
or
the
other
the
minister
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
an
interview
we
re
a
small
country
but
when
it
comes
to
shipping
we
are
a
force
to
reckon
the
marshall
islands
a
pacific
nation
where
the
united
states
carried
out
nuclear
tests
in
the
and
is
home
to
people
the
majority
of
them
living
in
majuro
the
capital
and
ebeye
the
second
largest
city
already
it
is
struggling
with
climate
change
pressures
from
stronger
king
tides
that
flood
homes
and
fields
and
seep
into
the
country
s
underground
fresh
water
to
worsening
droughts
said
paul
who
represents
kwajalein
atoll
the
country
s
largest
island
in
the
country
s
legislature
in
the
marshall
islands
we
re
at
the
forefront
of
climate
change
we
are
experiencing
it
day
in
and
day
out
he
said
as
saltwater
destroys
fields
and
water
supplies
it
s
becoming
far
harder
for
us
to
live
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
than
ever
before
such
creeping
losses
don
t
attract
the
international
attention
that
powerful
cyclones
do
but
the
frequency
of
these
events
adds
up
and
it
really
takes
a
toll
on
the
country
he
said
despite
that
there
s
no
way
we
re
going
to
migrate
and
leave
the
country
he
said
instead
the
country
aims
to
put
pressure
on
bigger
nations
to
cut
their
emissions
and
at
home
to
adapt
and
adjust
to
build
a
community
far
more
resilient
than
before
so
far
the
marshall
islands
government
is
promoting
water
harvesting
trying
out
new
roof
designs
aimed
at
capturing
and
channeling
rain
and
experimenting
with
desalination
among
other
efforts
but
the
biggest
push
is
to
reduce
the
islands
own
emissions
particularly
from
generators
that
still
provide
much
of
the
country
s
electricity
home
solar
power
systems
are
already
in
widespread
use
in
some
remote
atolls
and
the
country
is
developing
a
plan
to
install
solar
power
more
widely
and
become
carbon
neutral
by
that
will
happen
largely
by
cutting
fossil
fuel
use
from
electricity
production
and
transport
and
burning
trash
to
produce
electricity
paul
said
the
plan
expected
to
be
in
place
by
the
end
of
the
year
would
be
a
first
for
an
island
nation
said
the
minister
who
formerly
managed
the
country
s
utilities
and
now
also
serves
as
standing
in
as
needed
for
president
hilda
heine
we
absolutely
believe
we
can
become
carbon
neutral
by
he
said
but
finding
funding
to
make
the
switch
remains
a
frustration
not
least
because
the
marshall
islands
like
many
small
island
nations
lacks
the
bureaucratic
muscle
to
make
complex
funding
applications
and
because
it
needs
smaller
sums
which
big
donors
trying
to
move
billions
can
find
challenging
working
through
the
world
bank
the
country
received
a
first
grant
from
the
green
climate
fund
gcf
the
main
channel
for
billions
of
dollars
in
climate
finance
to
build
a
protective
sea
wall
on
kwajalein
atoll
which
is
also
home
to
a
military
garrison
but
getting
successful
applications
together
to
shift
the
country
s
energy
systems
has
proved
harder
paul
said
there
s
a
level
of
frustration
we
feel
we
know
what
we
need
and
what
needs
to
be
done
we
just
don
t
have
the
resources
he
said
globally
however
paul
has
no
doubt
a
shift
to
clean
energy
is
coming
solar
and
wind
power
are
now
cheaper
than
fossil
fuel
energy
in
many
parts
of
the
world
and
set
to
get
cheaper
still
with
batteries
poised
to
solve
the
problem
of
storing
renewable
energy
he
said
investors
and
businesses
will
turn
to
clean
energy
because
it
makes
sense
they
will
change
not
to
clean
the
atmosphere
but
because
they
want
to
make
money
and
make
their
shareholders
happy
he
said
but
making
that
happen
fast
enough
to
keep
the
marshall
islands
above
water
may
require
financial
institutions
governments
or
other
entities
stepping
in
to
absorb
some
of
the
early
risks
investors
face
in
switching
to
clean
energy
he
said
that
could
include
things
like
guaranteeing
set
rates
to
buy
clean
power
setting
national
policies
that
prioritise
buying
renewable
energy
simplifying
permits
or
offering
public
loans
or
tax
credits
for
clean
energy
investment
there
s
so
much
investment
money
that
s
sitting
idle
people
don
t
know
what
to
do
with
it
paul
said
if
some
of
the
risk
is
removed
clean
energy
investment
could
really
exponentially
