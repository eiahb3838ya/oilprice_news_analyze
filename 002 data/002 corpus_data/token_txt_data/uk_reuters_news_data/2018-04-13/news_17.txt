mexico
s
energy
minister
on
friday
rejected
calls
by
the
frontrunner
in
the
country
s
upcoming
presidential
race
to
freeze
gasoline
prices
saying
the
government
must
find
better
ways
to
avoid
price
spikes
leftist
presidential
hopeful
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
who
is
leading
most
polls
by
double
digits
ahead
of
the
july
vote
said
this
week
he
would
mandate
a
fuel
price
freeze
if
elected
while
a
promise
to
fix
gasoline
and
diesel
prices
might
seem
attractive
consequences
of
such
a
policy
would
be
unpredictable
said
energy
minister
pedro
joaquin
coldwell
at
an
event
in
the
capital
it
s
easy
to
freeze
but
on
the
other
hand
the
challenge
is
how
you
unfreeze
he
said
when
you
unfreeze
buckle
your
seat
belts
because
prices
are
going
to
mexico
which
has
over
the
past
couple
years
gradually
ended
a
policy
of
gasoline
prices
was
rocked
by
protests
early
last
year
after
a
increase
the
gasolinazo
which
officials
defended
at
the
time
as
a
necessary
measure
to
end
costly
fuel
subsidies
helped
sink
president
enrique
pena
nieto
s
approval
rating
to
historic
lows
the
liberalization
of
fuel
prices
in
mexico
is
part
of
a
landmark
energy
reform
finalized
in
the
energy
minister
said
the
government
should
instead
find
ways
to
make
prices
for
motor
fuels
as
well
as
electricity
rates
as
low
as
possible
through
what
he
described
as
technology
and
the
longtime
politician
whose
family
also
owns
several
pemex
gas
stations
said
the
finance
ministry
s
current
policy
of
weekly
adjustments
to
a
key
tax
applied
to
fuel
sales
is
a
better
way
to
keep
volatile
prices
swings
at
bay
that
permits
you
to
cushion
the
volatility
without
the
need
to
manipulate
the
market
