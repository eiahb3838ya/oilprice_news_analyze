the

suspended

pipeline
on

after
sinkholes
were
discovered
near
the
project
our
integrity
testing
for
mariner

is
complete
and
has
demonstrated
that
the

has
been
and
will
continue
to
be
safely
operated
as
we
have
previously

lisa

the

forced
shippers
including
gas
producers
range
resources

and
antero
resources

to
find
another
route
for
their
liquids
and
is
likely
causing
more
ethane
to
be
injected
into
the
region
s
natural
gas
pipelines
according
to
analysts
one
other
route
for
the

is

which
delivers
liquids
from
the
marcellus

utica
shale

the

due
in
part
to
inadvertent
