basf ceo-designate brudermueller says better to coordinate businesses under one roof, to develop basf further in that sense
frankfurt
reuters
the
incoming
boss
of
basf
has
thrown
his
weight
behind
the
chemical
titan
s
contentious
strategy
of
keeping
divergent
businesses
folded
into
one
company
at
a
time
when
its
major
rivals
such
as
dowdupont
are
breaking
themselves
up
the
comments
from
martin
brudermueller
who
will
take
over
as
ceo
on
friday
provide
clarity
on
a
key
strategic
issue
that
is
dividing
investors
in
marked
contrast
to
predecessor
kurt
bock
who
would
not
be
drawn
on
which
path
he
favored
the
german
group
has
grown
from
a
century
indigo
dye
workshop
to
a
diversified
juggernaut
worth
billion
it
is
the
only
major
western
chemicals
player
banking
on
an
integrated
value
chain
which
it
dubs
verbund
where
a
company
owns
businesses
throughout
the
production
process
we
often
hear
the
verbund
getting
criticized
for
being
too
rigid
that
s
not
true
said
brudermueller
if
you
have
everything
under
one
roof
you
can
coordinate
things
much
better
that
is
the
sense
in
which
we
will
develop
it
further
you
wouldn
t
normally
want
to
sell
attractive
businesses
that
are
growing
he
told
reuters
and
other
reporters
in
remarks
released
late
on
tuesday
at
its
ludwigshafen
headquarters
and
at
five
other
hubs
abroad
basf
runs
networks
of
chemical
reactors
that
churn
out
products
as
diverse
as
basic
commodities
coatings
vitamins
drug
ingredients
and
engineering
plastics
bock
when
asked
in
february
whether
basf
would
continue
to
have
diverse
businesses
under
one
roof
or
was
considering
other
options
said
the
company
might
learn
from
what
rivals
did
but
did
not
say
which
path
he
favored
both
strategies
have
potential
advantages
can
create
more
focused
individual
companies
and
allow
stronger
units
to
attract
investors
unshackled
from
weaker
ones
while
an
integrated
model
can
reduce
costs
rival
dowdupont
is
planning
to
break
up
into
a
materials
science
division
that
relies
on
basic
petrochemicals
plants
and
a
specialty
products
unit
selling
more
differentiated
and
complex
materials
a
third
will
focus
on
agriculture
in
other
recent
separation
deals
in
the
industry
bayer
spun
off
its
covestro
plastics
unit
and
is
now
selling
down
the
shares
air
products
specialty
chemicals
unit
versum
and
coatings
group
akzo
nobel
is
selling
its
specialty
chemicals
division
basf
competes
with
dowdupont
in
areas
such
as
pesticides
engineering
plastics
nutrition
insulation
foams
and
petrochemicals
its
rival
s
split
will
restore
basf
s
position
as
the
world
s
largest
chemical
maker
but
some
investors
and
analysts
would
rather
see
it
lose
that
crown
patrick
jahnke
portfolio
manager
at
deka
investments
which
owns
basf
stock
said
he
favored
the
firm
selling
its
upstream
petrochemical
assets
saying
the
benefits
of
physical
proximity
to
downstream
operations
could
be
shared
with
a
new
owner
you
can
sell
the
assets
but
the
factory
remains
in
place
jahnke
said
there
are
many
who
would
pay
a
high
price
for
upstream
basf
assets
private
equity
would
run
the
business
with
higher
debt
and
optimized
for
cash
flows
and
would
arrive
at
a
better
profitability
he
added
upstream
refers
to
basic
petrochemicals
and
downstream
to
more
complex
specialty
chemicals
a
portfolio
manager
at
a
top
basf
shareholder
who
declined
to
be
named
as
they
are
not
authorized
to
comment
publicly
on
the
investment
also
saw
the
merits
of
a
downstream
speciality
chems
could
work
separately
the
manager
said
to
and
reduce
complexity
tends
to
increase
multiples
and
returns
but
german
companies
are
not
well
known
for
basf
has
said
that
sharing
logistics
excess
energy
and
within
its
chemical
complexes
saves
it
more
than
billion
euros
billion
per
year
there
are
also
supporters
of
the
integrated
approach
among
basf
s
shareholders
arne
rautenberg
of
union
investment
said
there
was
still
a
lot
of
value
in
the
model
the
results
this
year
wouldn
t
have
been
good
without
the
basic
chemicals
assets
he
said
any
move
to
separating
them
from
the
rest
would
very
much
surprise
me
and
i
wouldn
t
be
excited
he
added
basf
has
been
a
tale
of
two
sectors
over
the
past
year
supply
bottlenecks
at
rivals
and
strong
industrial
demand
have
flung
basf
s
basic
chemicals
business
into
a
surprise
upward
cycle
meanwhile
margins
of
its
more
complex
specialty
products
the
group
s
designated
growth
drivers
have
been
squeezed
by
higher
raw
materials
prices
if
upstream
strength
dissipates
and
the
downstream
margin
struggles
continue
then
we
think
investor
focus
will
turn
to
portfolio
questions
hsbc
analyst
sriharsha
pappu
said
in
a
recent
research
note
if
allowed
to
strike
out
on
their
own
basf
units
making
construction
chemicals
coatings
and
catalytic
converters
could
bolster
their
earnings
and
fetch
better
trading
multiples
on
the
stock
market
the
hsbc
analyst
said
brudermueller
a
basf
veteran
is
currently
chief
technology
officer
and
deputy
ceo
at
the
firm
which
is
due
to
report
results
on
friday
he
said
that
his
focus
would
be
on
new
technologies
after
taking
over
from
ceo
bock
who
by
contrast
had
been
the
company
s
finance
chief
before
taking
the
helm
and
has
a
background
in
business
administration
the
cited
cathode
materials
for
car
batteries
as
one
area
of
focus
and
also
using
basf
s
new
supercomputer
to
speed
up
discovery
of
new
compounds
the
fact
that
i
have
a
background
in
technology
and
science
will
result
in
us
having
a
change
in
perspective
he
said
adding
that
he
would
provide
an
update
on
basf
s
strategy
towards
the
end
of
the
year
