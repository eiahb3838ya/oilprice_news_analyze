london
reuters
bp
held
out
the
prospect
of
a
first
dividend
increase
since
on
tuesday
after
profits
beat
forecasts
thanks
to
rising
oil
and
gas
prices
and
production
chief
financial
officer
brian
gilvary
said
the
company
might
consider
raising
the
dividend
later
this
year
if
oil
prices
remain
near
current
levels
and
debt
declines
in
the
first
three
months
of
however
bp
s
debt
rose
to
billion
billion
pounds
due
to
the
settlement
of
more
lawsuits
over
the
deadly
deepwater
horizon
spill
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
which
has
cost
it
more
than
billion
a
nearly
percent
rise
in
oil
prices
over
the
past
year
to
over
a
barrel
has
lifted
revenue
for
oil
companies
shifting
investors
focus
to
how
much
cash
they
can
generate
following
years
of
cost
cuts
results
in
the
sector
have
been
a
mixed
bag
with
royal
dutch
shell
and
exxon
mobil
falling
short
of
forecasts
while
results
from
chevron
and
total
were
stronger
than
expected
bp
s
cash
flow
from
operating
activities
rose
sharply
from
a
year
earlier
to
billion
but
declined
from
the
previous
quarter
as
a
result
of
the
deepwater
horizon
payments
and
charges
stripping
those
out
cash
flow
reached
billion
in
the
quarter
the
strongest
since
overall
it
was
a
very
healthy
set
of
results
said
martijn
rats
analyst
at
morgan
stanley
which
has
a
neutral
recommendation
on
bp
stock
bp
shares
were
percent
higher
at
gmt
compared
with
a
percent
gain
in
the
european
oil
and
gas
index
the
surge
in
revenue
led
bp
last
october
to
become
the
first
european
oil
major
to
resume
share
buybacks
in
order
to
offset
the
dilutive
effect
of
scrip
dividend
where
shareholders
can
opt
to
receive
dividends
via
cash
or
shares
in
the
first
quarter
bp
bought
back
million
shares
worth
million
investors
are
now
hoping
for
the
company
to
announce
its
first
dividend
increase
since
the
third
quarter
of
with
these
oil
prices
we
will
now
see
net
debt
naturally
start
to
decline
and
that
will
give
an
opportunity
later
this
year
for
potential
further
distribution
around
buybacks
or
a
conversation
with
the
board
around
dividend
gilvary
told
analysts
on
a
conference
call
bp
s
underlying
replacement
cost
profit
its
definition
of
net
income
rose
percent
to
billion
in
the
first
quarter
exceeding
the
billion
forecast
by
analysts
in
a
survey
the
last
time
bp
generated
so
much
profit
was
in
the
third
quarter
of
when
oil
prices
averaged
a
barrel
brent
crude
is
currently
trading
around
a
barrel
bp
launched
seven
oil
and
gas
fields
in
a
record
year
and
is
set
to
inaugurate
six
more
projects
this
year
including
in
egypt
azerbaijan
and
britain
s
north
sea
which
will
help
it
boost
production
by
barrels
per
day
bpd
by
most
of
it
gas
production
rose
percent
to
million
bpd
it
s
not
only
about
the
oil
price
it
is
also
about
the
performance
of
the
kit
gilvary
said
bp
s
gearing
the
ratio
between
debt
and
bp
s
equity
market
value
stood
at
percent
at
the
end
of
the

the
end
of
net
debt
at
the
end
of
march
was
billion
up
from

at
the
end
of
the
results
were
impacted
by
a
billion

for
the
settlement
of
the
deepwater
horizon
spill
bp
is
expected
to
pay
billion

rats
said
debt
was
expected
to
fall
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
after
most
of
the
deepwater

claims
are
settled
and

continues
to
