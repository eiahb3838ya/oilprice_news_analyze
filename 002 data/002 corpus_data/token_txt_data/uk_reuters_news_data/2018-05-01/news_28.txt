the
dollar
broke
into
positive
territory
for
the
year
and
bond
yields
were
creeping
higher
again
on
tuesday
as
the
recent
rise
in
oil
prices
fuelled
bets
that
the
federal
reserve
will
flag
more
interest
rate
hikes
this
week
may
day
holidays
across
asia
and
europe
meant
trading
was
thinner
than
usual
though
there
was
more
than
enough
news
flow
to
keep
those
that
were
open
occupied
there
was
some
optimism
after
president
donald
trump
extended
steel
and
aluminium
tariff
exemptions
for
europe
canada
and
mexico
for
another
month
but
there
was
cause
for
caution
too
disappointing
british
manufacturing
and

added
to
europe
s
recent
run
of
poor
data
worries
about
iran
s
nuclear
deal
simmered
in
oil
markets
and
wall
street
was
waiting
for
apple
s
results
following
recent
whispers
of
weak
iphone
demand
the
dollar
made
most
of
the
running
though
as
it
turned
positive
for
just
ahead
of
a
fed
meeting
that
is
expected
to
pave
the
way
for
another
two
or
even
three
rate
hikes
this
year
dollar
bulls
in
london
took
advantage
of
the
holiday
in
most
of
the
rest
of
europe
to
push
the
currency
to
almost
per
euro
and
helped
it
make
good
ground
against
the
swiss
franc
and
the
pound
provided
the
fed
conveys
a
approach
and
it
isn
t
seen
to
be
back
tracking
and
there
is
no
reason
from
the
data
why
it
should
the
dollar
should
be
consolidating
and
pushing
on
from
this
level
said
bank
of
new
york
mellon
senior
currency
strategist
neil
mellor
he
added
that
the
key
change
has
been
the
move
of
the
treasury
bond
yield
to
percent
last
week
it
was
nudging
up
at
percent
on
tuesday
which
also
left
the
gap
between
and
german
benchmark
bond
yields
just
off
its
widest
level
in
nearly
three
decades
the
dollar
has
surged
over
percent
in
the
last
two
weeks
it
has
been
a
bit
like
a
dam
bursting

move
for
europe
s
stocks
followers
only
london
s
ftse
and

were
open
they
were
both
higher
though
thanks
to
the
boost
to
exporters
of
lower
domestic
currencies
upbeat
results
from
oil
giant
bp
and
relief
that
trump
hadn
t
pushed
ahead
with
his
steel
and
aluminium
tariffs
for
now
at
least
stock

were
barely
budged
ahead
of
the

overnight
in
asia
japan
s
nikkei
closed
up
percent
while
australian
shares
hit

as
its
huge

also
breathed
easier
apple
s
quarterly
results
are
due
after
wall
street
closes
and
will
be
a
big
focus
after
several
weeks
of
speculation
about
ebbing
smartphone
demand
based
on
selective
reports
from
companies
in
its
supply
chain
technology
sector
results
so
far
at
least
from
the
likes
of
amazon
alphabet
microsoft
samsung
and
sap
have
broadly
beaten
forecasts
for

the
overall
aggregate
earnings
growth
is
tracking
highs
of
almost
percent
earnings
have
been
really
strong
so
far
microsoft
and
amazon
had
a
bumper
quarter
the
only
concern
has
been
apple
said
hirokazu
kabeya
chief
global
strategist
at
daiwa
securities
the
strong
dollar
was
felt
widely
across
commodity
markets
and
the
emerging
economies
that
are
now
borrowing
record
amounts
of
debt
in
the
currency
trillion
according
to
the
latest
figures
this
week
from
the

msci

emerging

share
index
fell
percent
with
russian
stocks
chalking
up
some
of
the
biggest
losses
and
currencies
and
bonds
staying
firmly
under
pressure
too
brent
oil
prices
eased
off
highs
of
just
over
a
barrel
set
on
monday
on
worries
that
president
donald
trump
may
pull
out
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
thereby
bring
back
sanctions
on
its
oil
output
the
white
house
had
said
on
monday
that
information
provided
by
israel
on
iran
s
nuclear
programme
had
provided
new
and
compelling
details
a
trade
delegation
will
also
be
in
beijing
for
meetings
later
this
week
amid
lingering
worries
about
a
possible
trade
war
between
the
world

top
two
economies
copper

is
highly
attuned
to
china
s
economy
hit
its
lowest
in
three
weeks
at
a

accelerating
downwards
after
it
broke
below
its
moving
average
at
gold
meanwhile
hit
a
low
of
an
ounce
as
the
dollar
strength
and
bets
on
higher
interest
rates
kept
it
on
the
slide
having
already
gone
dropped
through
its
moving
average
investors
are
buying
dollars
and
this
is
adding
pressure
