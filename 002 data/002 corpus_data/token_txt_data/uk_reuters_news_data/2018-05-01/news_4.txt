new
york
reuters
a
biofuels
trade
group
asked
a
federal
court
on
tuesday
to
rule
whether
the
environmental
protection
agency
violated
the
law
in
granting
a
growing
number
of
small
refineries
exemptions
from
renewable
fuel
laws
according
to
a
court
filing
the
advanced
biofuels
association
abfa
which
counts
oil
major
bp
plc
as
a
member
submitted
a
petition
to
review
the
agency
s
waiver
decisions
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
washington
dc
abfa
members
are
concerned
that
administrator
scott
pruitt
is
granting
these
exemptions
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
manner
to
undisclosed
parties
behind
closed
doors
with
no
accountability
for
its
process
michael
mcadams
the
head
of
the
trade
group
said
in
a
statement
the
epa
did
not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for
comment
the
lawsuit
is
the
latest
move
in
the
biofuel
industry
s
fight
with
the
epa
over
the
agency
s
expansion
of
the
hardship
exemption
from
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
the
rfs
requires
refiners
to
blend
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
fuel
each
year
or
purchase
blending
credits
from
other
companies
a
policy
intended
to
provide
a
boost
to
midwestern
corn
growers
reduce
pollution
and
cut
fuel
imports
in
the
past
the
epa
has
issued
between
six
and
eight
waivers
from
the
rfs
per
year
to
refining
operations
of
less
than
barrels
per
day
that
can
demonstrate
they
are
struggling
financially
to
comply
the
epa
has
said
it
has
granted
more
than
two
dozen
waivers
for
but
has
declined
to
name
the
recipients
the
surge
in
approvals
comes
after
a
federal
judge
in
august
said
the
epa
had
been
using
criteria
that
was
too
strict
in
denying
exemptions
biofuel
groups
say
the
epa
is
using
the
court
decision
as
a
rationale
to
gut
the
rfs
and
that
some
of
the
nation
s
largest
refining
companies
have
secured
exemptions
reuters
reported
in
april
that
andeavor
one
of
america
s
biggest
refining
companies
which
reported
about
billion
in
net
profit
last
year
was
among
companies
that
received
hardship
waivers
an
andeavor
spokeswoman
destin
singleton
declined
to
comment
for
that
article
the
epa
also
granted
a
waiver
to
a
refinery
owned
by
billionaire
carl
icahn
a
former
adviser
to
president
donald
trump
according
to
two
industry
sources
briefed
on
the
matter
the
epa
keeps
the
names
of
the
recipients
secret
arguing
it
is
confidential
