higher
oil
prices
are
set
to
boost
trade
surpluses
in
the
gulf
over
the
next
months
but
economies
will
grow
only
moderately

austerity
policies
a
quarterly
reuters
poll
of
private
economists
shows
the
brent
oil
price
now
nearly
a
barrel
has
averaged
over
so
far
this
year
a
leap
from
last
year
s
average
of
just
below
that
is
good
news
for
the
six
wealthy
countries
of
the
region
if
prices
stay
at
their
current
level
that
would
translate
into
a

of

many
economists
don
t
think
oil
prices
will
stay
as
high
as
their
current
levels
into
next
year
but
they
are
nevertheless
raising
their
forecasts
for
the
gulf
s
external
balances
bigger
surpluses

in
the
case
of
the
weakest

oman
and
bahrain
smaller
deficits
would
reduce
pressure
on
countries
foreign
exchange
reserves
which
were
hit
by
the
plunge
of
oil
prices
after
saudi
arabia
for
example
is
now
expected
to
run
a
current
account
surplus
of
percent
of
gdp
this
year
according
to
the
reuters
poll
of
economists
instead
of
the
percent
forecast
in
the
previous
poll
last
january
the
median
forecast
for
next
year
has
been
lifted
to
percent
from
percent
oman
is
now
expected
to
run
a
current
account
deficit
of
percent
this
year
instead
of
the
previous
forecast
of
percent
because
of
higher
oil
prices
oman
s
state
budget
deficit
is
now
forecast
at
percent
of
gdp
this
year
and
percent
next
year
still
unsustainably
high
in
the
long
run
but
better
than
the
previous
forecasts
for
deficits
of
percent
and
percent
while
firm
oil
prices
would
bolster
state
coffers
however
they
would
not
necessarily
boost
economic
growth
much
that
s
because
some
economies
will
continue
to
labour
under
recent
austerity
policies
such
as
the
imposition
of
percent
tax
in
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
in
january
many
countries
are
taking
advantage
of
higher
oil
prices
to
raise
state
spending
and
water
down
parts
of
their
austerity
programmes
for
that
reason
saudi
arabia
is
now
expected
to
run
a
state
budget
deficit
of
percent
of
gdp
in
instead
of
percent
and
percent
in
instead
of
percent
that
may
not
be
enough
to
stimulate
much
new
growth
in
the
private
sector
though
gdp
data
showed
that
the
downturn
in
saudi
arabia
s
economy
deepened
at
the
end
of
last
year
a
fading
drag
from
the
oil
sector
appears
to
have
returned
the
economy
to
positive
growth
at
the
start
of
this
year
but
the
sector
seems
to
be
suffering
capital
economics
said
the
median
forecast
for
saudi
arabia
s
gdp
growth
this
year
remains
unchanged
at
percent
though
next
year
s
prediction
has
been
raised
slightly
to
percent
