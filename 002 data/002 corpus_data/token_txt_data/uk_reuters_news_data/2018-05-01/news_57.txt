analysis-boom time comes early to west texas oil patch
midland
texas
reuters
in
west
texas
rising
oil
prices
are
fuelling
a
sharp
economic
upswing
lifting
employment
and
pay
to
records
driving
up
spending
at
hotels
restaurants
and
car
dealerships
and
raising
the
cost
of
housing
and
other
essentials
this
parched
patch
of
land
under
which
lie
the
largest
rock
formations
in
the
united
states
is
used
to
growth
binges
as
well
as
the
busts
that
always
follow
after
a
crash
the
price
of
crude
began
to
recover
in
and
pierced
a
barrel
early
this
year
but
oil
is
still
far
cheaper
than
at
the
peak
of
the
previous
boom
that
began
in
north
dakota
s
bakken
oil
patch
and
supercharged
the
city
of
williston
in
the
permian
basin
which
stretches
across
west
texas
and
eastern
new
mexico
the
latest
boom
is
being
helped
by
advances
in
technology
that
allow
drillers
to
extract
much
more
from
each
acre
is
like
the
new
said
dallas
fed
economist
michael
plante
in
a
interview
breakeven
costs
are
now
as
little
as
per
barrel
according
to
the
dallas
fed
s
most
recent
survey
so
energy
companies
here
no
longer
need
oil
to
make
lots
of
money
and
midland
and
its
neighbour
odessa
the
biggest
towns
for
miles
and
the
regional
base
for
major
oil
producers
in
the
permian
basin
including
occidental
petroleum
corp
chevron
corp
apache
corp
and
pioneer
natural
resources
co
are
feeling
the
surge
it
is
a
boom
says
dale
redman
chief
executive
of
propetro
a
midland
texas
firm
that
supplies
heavyduty
horsepower
to
drill
sites
where
energy
companies
coax
crude
from
the
ground
with
sand
and
water
he
has
tripled
his
workforce
since
early
drawing
workers
from
towns
and
cities
hundreds
of
miles
away
over
half
of
his
employees
make
more
than
what
it
has
done
is
raised
wages
for
all
these
folks
but
housing
and
the
cost
of
living
has
gone
up
as
to
midland
mayor
jerry
morales
it
s
a
good
story
right
he
says
the
city
is
trying
to
keep
up
with
the
drop
in
housing
inventory
and
rise
in
rents
by
approving
new
apartment
complexes
and
working
with
developers
to
put
in
water
and
sewer
pipes
but
as
owner
of
two
restaurants
in
town
including
gerardo
s
casita
he
sees
the
other
side
too
the
biggest
problem
i
face
is
low
unemployment
finding
workers
he
said
in
a
phone
interview
adding
that
he
is
increasing
pay
every
six
months
to
keep
staff
from
leaving
for
other
jobs
and
he
is
hiking
his
menu
prices
as
well
oil
companies
are
drilling
wells
faster
and
putting
more
wells
on
a
single
site
using
technology
to
find
the
best
angles
and
depths
to
get
the
most
out
of
each
layer
of
shale
that
has
helped
boost
output
by
texas
oil
and
gas
companies
to
an
estimated
according
to
waco
economist
ray
perryman
companies
are
making
enough
money
to
be
able
to
afford
to
pay
higher
wages
he
said
unemployment
was
percent
in
odessa
and
percent
in
midland
in
february
average
weekly
earnings
in
march
hit
records
in
both
towns
which
have
a
combined
population
of
about
sales
tax
receipts
have
soared
you
have
people
that
move
in
you
train
them
and
then
someone
else
offers
them
a
job
there
is
constant
raiding
going
on
says
jeff
sparks
chief
operating
officer
of
discovery
oil
in
midland
who
has
only
recently
shifted
to
the
more
efficient
and
drilling
techniques
that
have
pushed
extraction
costs
down
so
steeply
