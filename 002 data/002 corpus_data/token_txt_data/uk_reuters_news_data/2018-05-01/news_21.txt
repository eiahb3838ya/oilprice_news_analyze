alliance
weaponry
compatible
with

but
the
question
of

warplanes

has
been
vexing
successive
governments
in

for
more
than
a
decade
and
karakachanov
said
it
could
opt
for
more
than
the
eight
aircraft
laid
down
in
a
plan
approved
by
parliament
in
but
never
implemented
we
have
made
a
change
karakachanov

are
options
when

did
not
say

the
government
should
consider
i
will
not
go
into
the
details

the
conversations
that
we
have
held
in

or
what
kind
of
proposals
we
have
received

treated
equally
three
months
later
prime

borissov
also
expressed
doubt
that
