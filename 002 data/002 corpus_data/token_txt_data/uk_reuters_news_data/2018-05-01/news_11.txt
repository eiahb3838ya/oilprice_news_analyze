new
york
attorney
general
eric
schneiderman
said
the
trump
administration
conducted
a
phony
study
to
justify
less
rigid
emission
rules
the
obama
rules
adopted
in
sought
to
double
average
vehicle
fuel
efficiency
to
about
miles
km
per
gallon
by
but
included
an
evaluation
due
by

to
determine
if
the
rules
were
appropriate
adjusting
for
a
shift
in
consumer
demand
to
larger
vehicles
the
current
rules
are
projected
to
hike
fuel
efficiency
to
a
fleetwide
average
of
miles
per
gallon
by
according
to
a
letter
sent
tuesday
by
senator
tom
carper
to

elaine
chao
carper
said
that
according
to
a
draft
proposal
he
obtained
the
administration
favors
freezing
standards
through
and
that
would
result
in
a
fleetwide
average
of
mpg
by
carper
said
the
draft
shows
the
administration
s
preferred
alternative
would
result
in
americans
using
billion
more
gallons
of
gasoline
through
versus
the
current
standards
automakers
want
rule
changes
to
address
lower
gasoline
prices
and
the
shift
in
consumer
preferences
to
bigger
less
vehicles
the
trump
administration
plans
to
argue
the
weaker
rules
will
lead
to
cheaper
vehicles
boost
sales
and
employment
and
improve
safety
by
prodding
faster
turnover
of
older
vehicles
people
briefed
on
the
matter
and
carper
s
letter
said
in
march
trump
suggested
he
would
soften
the
mandates
the
assault
on
the
american
auto
industry
is
over
he
told
autoworkers
california
air
resources
board
chief
mary
nichols
told
reuters
last
month
that
a
group
of
states
was
considering
the
legal
move
but
it
does
not
mean
they
could
not
still
try
to
reach
agreement
with
automakers
and
the
federal
government
we
can
sue
and
talk
at
the
same
time
nichols
said
former
new
york
mayor
michael
bloomberg
praised
the
states
lawsuit
and
said
the
trump
administration
could
not
stop
americans
from
working
to
improve
the
climate
the
epa
would
have
better
luck
trying
to
require
than
they
would
trying
to
stop
the
push
for
cleaner
vehicles
