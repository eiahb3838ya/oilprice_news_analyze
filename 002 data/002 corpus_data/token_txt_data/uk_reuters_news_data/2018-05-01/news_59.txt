and
strong
economic

thomson
reuters
data
yet
rising

down

announcement
due

from
apple
the
world
s
largest
company
by

capitalisation
is
attracting
close
attention
given
speculation
the

iphone

have
been
sluggish
earnings
have
been
really
strong
so
far
microsoft
and
amazon
had
a
bumper
quarter
the
only
concern
has
been
apple
which
has
been
said
to
be
lacklustre
hopefully
unless
they
come
up
with
downbeat
guidance
the

may
take
it
in

said
hirokazu
kabeya
chief
global
strategist
at
daiwa
securities
the
market
got
a
little
relief
when
the
united
states
decided
to
postpone
the
start
date
for
steel
and
aluminium
tariffs
against
the
european
union
canada
and
mexico
to
june
the
united
states
also
reached
agreements
in
principle
on
tariffs
with
some
other
countries
including
australia
and
brazil
the
news
first
reported
by
the
wall
street
journal
lifted
worries
the
exemptions
would
expire
on
tuesday
easing
investors
worst
fears
markets
are
kind
of
expecting
the
trump
way
of
negotiation
to
continue
so
i
do
not
think
markets
are
overly
concerned
about
them
at
this
point

although
the

it
added
to
recent
signs
that
germany
s
economy
could
be
losing
some
momentum
after
last

s
surprisingly
strong

the

been
supported
against
many

to
the

benjamin
netanyahu
stepped
up
pressure
on
the

of
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
presenting

he
said

diplomats
said
he

not
