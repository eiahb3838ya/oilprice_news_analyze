france
s
foreign
ministry
said
on
tuesday
that
an
israeli
intelligence
haul
on
iran
s
past
nuclear
weapons
programme
could
form
the
basis
of
a
push
for
assurances
on
tehran
s
nuclear
activities
israeli
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
unveiled
on
monday
what
he
said
was
evidence
of
a
secret
iranian
nuclear
weapons
programme
that
could
encourage
the
united
states
to
pull
out
this
month
of
a
nuclear
deal
between
iran
and
world
powers
this
information
should
be
studied
and
evaluated
in
detail
foreign
ministry
spokeswoman
agnes
von
der
muhll
said
in
a
statement
the
new
information
presented
by
israel
could
also
confirm
the
need
for
assurances
on
the
iranian
programme
as
the
president
has
since
travelling
to
the
united
states
last
week
french
leader
emmanuel
macron
has
spoken
to
leaders
in
israel
russia
britain
germany
and
iran
to
propose
a
new
negotiation
on
a
wider
agreement
that
would
tackle
iran
s
nuclear
activities
when
the
existing
deal
begins
to
expire
as
well
as
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
and
its
regional
influence
intelligence
experts
and
diplomats
said
netanyahu
s
presentation
in
a
television
presentation
did
not
seem
to
have
a
smoking
gun
showing
a
violation
by
iran
but
it
could
strengthen
the
hand
of
advisers
to
president
donald
trump
who
want
to
scrap
the
nuclear
agreement
von
der
muhll
said
the
information
presented
by
netanyahu
confirmed
in
part
the
nature
of
the
programme
revealed
by
european
powers
in
but
that
it
merely
proved
the
need
to
ensure
the
nuclear
deal
and
inspections
remained
given
they
were
among
the
most
comprehensive
and
robust
in
the
history
of
nuclear
it
is
essential
that
the
iaea
can
continue
to
verify
iran
s
respect
for
jcpoa
nuclear
deal
and
the
peaceful
nature
of
its
nuclear
programme
she
said
she
added
that
a
commission
of
the
countries
that
agreed
the
deal
china
britain
france
germany
russia
and
the
united
states
and
iran
could
review
