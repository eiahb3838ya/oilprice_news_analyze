update 1-uber loses its licence in southern uk coastal city of brighton
london
reuters
uber
s
licence
in
the
southern
english
coastal
city
of
brighton
will
not
be
renewed
the
local
council
said
on
tuesday
adding
the
taxi
app
is
not
fit
and
proper
and
citing
concerns
over
a
data
breach
and
the
use
of
drivers
from
outside
the
area
the
silicon
valley
firm
is
also
battling
a
decision
by
london
s
transport
regulator
last
september
to
strip
the
firm
of
its
licence
after
which
brighton
granted
a
extension
while
it
monitored
the
situation
on
tuesday
the
chair
of
brighton
s
licensing
panel
councillor
jackie
o
quinn
said
the
council
would
not
renew
the
firm
s
right
to
operate
in
the
area
partly
after
the
company
failed
to
promptly
disclose
a
hack
which
affected
some
million
accounts
worldwide
our
priority
is
the
safety
of
residents
and
visitors
and
due
to
the
data
breach
and
the
lack
of
commitment
to
using
drivers
licensed
here
we
were
not
satisfied
that
ubl
uber
britannia
limited
are
a
fit
and
proper
person
to
hold
an
operator
s
licence
she
said
uber
said
it
would
be
appealing
this
is
a
disappointing
decision
for
the
thousands
of
passengers
and
drivers
who
rely
on
our
app
in
brighton
and
hove
we
intend
to
appeal
so
we
can
continue
serving
the
city
a
spokesman
said
uber
has
made
changes
to
its
business
model
in
recent
months
responding
to
requests
from
regulators
including
the
introduction
of
telephone
support
and
the
proactive
reporting
of
serious
incidents
to
police
whilst
its
licences
have
been
renewed
in
a
number
of
british
cities
including
sheffield
cambridge
nottingham
and
leicester
york
council
last
year
stripped
the
firm
of
its
ability
to
operate
