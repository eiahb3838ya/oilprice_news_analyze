helping
the
oil
producing
nation
in
its
efforts
to
boost
agricultural
output
and
reduce
food
imports
things
are
moving
slowly
but
better
than
in
past
years
said

who
has
fields
of
cereals
and
vegetables
in
bourkika
about
km

he
said
after
weeks
of
heavy
rain
relieved
a
long
period
of
drought
in
the
north
african
country
algeria
a
member
of
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
has
long
neglected
its
farmers
and
focused
on
its
oil
and
gas
industry
that
generates
about
percent
of
state
revenues
but
a
crash
in
oil
prices
from
above
a
barrel
in
to
below
in
left
the
nation
struggling
to
fund
its
billion
annual
import
bill
and
has
prompted
the
government
to
look
for
ways
to
ease
the
strain
on
its
coffers
with
percent
of
the
import
bill
going
on
food
the
government
has
launched
a
drive
to
increase
local
production
seeking
to
encourage
farmers
with
incentives
such
as
low
interest
loans
and
free
vaccinations
for
livestock
it
is
also
expanding
the
use
of
irrigation
to
cover
million
hectares
in
from
million
hectares
now
officials
say
helping
farmers
who
rely
on
rains
that
can
fail
the
government
is
building
new
dams
to
add
to
the
existing
ones
to
water
cereals
covering
an
area
of
hectares
up
from
just
hectares
now
now
algeria
is
offering
the
agricultural
sector
with
great
support
with
huge
funds
to
help
the
production
and
to
provide
food
for
all
algerians
said
mohamed
djahed
head
of
the
parliamentary
agriculture
committee
the
government
wants
to
boost
output
of
wheat
one
of
the
main
items
on
the
food
import
bill
to
million
tonnes
by
from
million
tonnes
in
algeria
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
wheat
importers
is
expected
to
consume
million
tonnes
of
the
grain
in
the
season
the
foreign
agricultural
service
said
algeria
also
wants
to
double
output
for
other
products
such
as
potatoes
milk
and
meat
over
four
years
in
addition
to
promoting
algerian
production
the
government
has
drawn
up
a
list
of
items
that
it
now
bans
from
being
imported
including
some
food
products
but
government
initiatives
are
taking
time
to
feed
through
official
figures
show
the
overall
value
of
food
imports
fell
by
just
percent
in
the
first
quarter
of
compared
with
a
year
earlier
while
the
value
of
cereal
and
milk
imports
rose
algeria
has
all
the
tools
needed
to
promote
production
said
an
economics
professor
at
algiers
university
asking
not
to
be
identified
but
as
usual
the
implementation
will
take
time
because
of
nevertheless
farmers
are
responding
to
the
government
push
mohamed
amine
abid
who
breeds
dairy
cattle
has
increased
his
herd
to
cows
from
since
starting
up
in
helped
by
state
aid
that
included
an
extra
piece
of
land
our
objective
is
to
develop
the
algerian
cow
we
want
it
to
be
born
in
and
raised
in
algeria
to
get
used
to
our
climate
he
said
the
state
budget
is
still
stretched
even
as
oil
prices
have
been
recovering
so
some
government
initiatives
have
been
scrapped
but
prime
minister
ahmed
ouyahia
said
agriculture
spending
worth
about
billion
this
year
would
not
be
cut
in
however
analysts
say
providing
aid
is
not
sufficient
to
achieve
the
government
s
goal
of
increasing
agriculture
s
share
of
economic
output
from
percent
now
as
long
as
youths
are
losing
interest
in
the
land
and
looking
elsewhere
for
jobs
we
need
to
win
the
food
security
battle
