through a fog of data, air of indian cities' looks dirtiest
geneva
reuters
india
should
follow
china
s
example
and
clean
up
the
air
in
its
cities
which
are
among
the
world
s
worst
for
outdoor
pollution
the
world
health
organization
said
on
wednesday
the
who
s
database
of
more
than
cities
showed
indian
cities
such
as
new
delhi
varanasi
and
patna
were
among
the
most
polluted
based
on
the
amount
of
particulate
matter
under
micrograms
found
in
every
cubic
meter
of
air
chinese
cities
such
as
xingtai
and
shijiazhuang
and
the
saudi
refining
hub
at
jubail
were
also
highly
polluted
but
the
data
for
those
places
was
years
old
and
maria
neira
who
s
head
of
public
health
said
china
had
made
big
improvements
that
india
should
follow
there
is
a
big
step
at
the
government
level
in
china
declaring
war
on
air
pollution
neira
said
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
is
that
the
health
argument
was
very
strongly
presented
and
the
fact
that
the
citizens
were
really
breathing
air
that
was
totally
we
would
be
very
happy
if
we
would
see
a
similar
movement
now
in
india
which
is
one
of
the
countries
for
which
we
are
particularly
concerned
although
there
are
good
initiatives
which
can
be
put
in
place
quickly
still
the
levels
are
very
high
and
we
would
like
to
see
a
similar
decision
and
the
who
says
nine
out
of
people
on
the
planet
breathe
polluted
air
and
it
kills
million
people
each
year
almost
all
of
them
in
poor
countries
in
asia
and
africa
about
a
quarter
of
deaths
from
heart
disease
stroke
and
lung
cancer
can
be
attributed
to
air
pollution
the
who
says
globally
outdoor
air
pollution
has
remained
high
and
largely
unchanged
in
the
past
six
years
while
household
air
pollution
has
got
worse
in
many
poorer
countries
as
people
continue
to
cook
with
solid
fuel
or
kerosene
instead
of
cleaner
fuels
such
as
gas
and
electricity
the
transition
to
clean
fuels
and
technology
in
the
home
clean
household
energy
is
too
slow
it
s
been
three
decades
and
we
still
have
three
billion
people
primarily
relying
on
polluting
fuels
and
technologies
and
that
s
for
cooking
alone
said
who
technical
officer
heather
who
s
global
assessment
is
based
on
satellite
data
and
modeling
overlaid
on
the
database
of
cities
which
is
because
it
is
based
on
voluntary
reporting
with
numbers
that
have
been
hugely
revised
since
the
previous
report
the
most
polluted
city
in
s
report
zabol
in
iran
has
had
its
pollution
level
cut
fourfold
in
the
latest
version
of
the
database
and
now
appears
to
be
cleaner
than
australia
s
capital
canberra
the
data
we
are
presenting
today
is
i
think
the
most
accurate
you
can
expect
at
the
moment
