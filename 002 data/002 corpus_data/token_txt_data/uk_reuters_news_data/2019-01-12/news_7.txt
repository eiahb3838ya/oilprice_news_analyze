gabon
s
president
ali
bongo
who
has
been
out
of
the
country
for
two
months
recovering
from
a
stroke
named
a
new
prime
minister
on
saturday
in
an
apparent
effort
to
shore
up
his
political
base
days
after
a
failed
coup
attempt
the
plotters
of
monday
s
coup
attempt
were
arrested
or
killed
within
hours
of
seizing
the
national
radio
station
but
the
move
reflected
growing
frustration
with
a
government
weakened
by
bongo
s
secretive
medical
leave
in
morocco
in
a
decree
read
by
the
of
the
presidency
on
national
television
early
on
saturday
morning
bongo
named
julien
nkoghe
bekale
as
prime
minister
replacing
emmanuel
who
has
served
since
s
tenure
was
marked
by
a
sharp
drop
in
oil
output
and
prices
that
has
squeezed
revenues
raised
debt
and
stoked
discontent
in
the
opec
member
state
oil
workers
strikes
have
become
more
common
and
economic
growth
was
percent
last
year
down
from
over
percent
in
the
nomination
of
nkoghe
bekale
who
has
held
several
ministerial
posts
since
represents
a
return
to
a
tradition
begun
by
bongo
s
father
omar
of
choosing
prime
ministers
from
the
fang
gabon
s
largest
ethnic
group
omar
bongo
ruled
gabon
from
until
his
death
in
establishing
the
country
as
a
pillar
of
francafrique
a
web
of
influence
that
gave
companies
from
former
colonial
power
france
favoured
access
to
african
autocrats
the
bongos
come
from
a
smaller
ethnic
group
and
the
appointments
were
a
way
of
broadening
the
president
s
base
but
ali
bongo
who
succeeded
his
father
when
he
died
bucked
tradition
in
by
choosing
who
comes
from
a
different
ethnic
group
bongo
s
absence
from
gabon
since
his
stroke
in
saudi
arabia
has
raised
questions
about
his
ability
to
continue
carrying
out
his
official
functions
although
the
government
has
insisted
he
is
recovering
well
a
address
from
morocco
in
which
the
president
slurred
his
speech
and
appeared
unable
to
move
his
right
arm
failed
to
reassure
many
gabonese
and
was
cited
as
one
of
the
coup
plotters
reasons
for
acting
bongo
won
in
by
fewer
than
votes
amid
widespread
accusations
of
fraud
sparking
deadly
clashes
between
protesters
and
police
during
which
the
parliament
was
torched
