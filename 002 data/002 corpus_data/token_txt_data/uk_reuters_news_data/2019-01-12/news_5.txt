the
mood
at
latin
america
s
largest
wholesale
market
the
central
de
abastos
in
mexico
city
has
morphed
from
typically
cacophonous
and
bustling
to
cloudy
and
anxious
as
deliveries
and
sales
grow
sluggish
amid
a
fuel
shortage
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
late
last
month
launched
a
sweeping
plan
to
stanch
rampant
fuel
theft
the
first
major
move
of
his
young
administration
against
widespread
corruption
and
organised
crime
but
the
move
to
close
key
fuel
pipelines
that
have
been
tapped
by
criminals
and
instead
distribution
via
trucks
has
prompted
lines
at
gas
stations
while
threatening
to
crimp
the
economy
and
damage
the
president
s
popularity
if
shortages
persist
the
effects
of
the
crackdown
have
grown
noticeably
in
the
past
week
at
the
central
de
abastos
where
cars
and
trucks
converge
daily
to
buy
and
sell
fruits
plants
and
other
goods
according
to
figures
provided
by
the
market
vendors
say
many
have
been
staying
home
forty
to
percent
of
supply
has
been
affected
said
rafael
perez
the
purchasing
director
for
drinks
depot
a
beverages
wholesaler
we
are
talking
about
suppliers
from
the
states
of
hidalgo
guerrero
cuernavaca
puebla
and
our
suppliers
deliveries
have
been
impacted
perez
added
customers

not
avocado
vendor
juan
carlos
ximil
said
he
had
seen
a
drop
of
about
to
percent
in
sales
of
his
stock
which
he
normally
purchases
from
suppliers
outside
the
capital
including
morelos
edomex
and
the
state
of
michoacan
his
customers
modest
vendors
and
grocery
stores
with
limited
means
of
transport
have
stayed
away
too
he
said
most
likely
because
fears
of
long
waits
to
stock
up
on
gasoline
or
a
shortage
itself
would
hit
hard
at
their
carefully
calibrated
daily
routines
i
feel
like
more
than
a
shortage
there
is
a
kind
of
collective
panic
said
ximil
if
you
were
used
to
consuming
pesos
of
gas
you
go
and
load
up
even
if
you
don
t
need
it
for
fear
that
you
