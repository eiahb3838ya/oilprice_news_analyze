into

on
thursday
while
the

in

after

in
the

for
a
second
day
too
the
extent
of
the
current
slowdown
in
the
global
economy
was
highlighted
as
india
unexpectedly
cut
its
interest
rates
and
the

got
hit
to
by

consecutive
drop
in

that
only
compounded

the

struggling

again
after

kept

while
gloomy

data
saw
new

suffer
a
similar
flop
as
its
australian
counterpart
had
seen
the
previous
day
the
kiwi
slid
to

as
it

to
its

the
index
has
risen
steadily
since
early

as
the
federal

changed
its
tune
and

have
surged
more
broadly

jumped
percent

expectations
of

after
the

previous

bias
japan
s
nikkei
slipped

though
and
the
caution
quickly
spread
to
europe
london
s
ftse
was
the
only
major
bourse
clinging
to
positive
territory
helped
by
a
weak
pound
whereas
the
rest
were
down
at
least
percent
as
were
futures
for
the
s
p
and
dow
one
of
the
day
s
big
surprises
came
from
india
where
its
central
bank
unexpectedly
lowered
interest
rates
to
percent
to
boost
a
slowing
economy
after
a
sharp
slide
in
the
inflation
rate
italian
bonds
were
back
under
pressure
with
the
european
commission
slashing
its
growth
forecast
italy
agreed
a
deficit
target
of
percent
in
december
averting
a
major
with
the
eu
though
this
was
based
on
a
growth
assumption
of
percent
slowing
growth
in
italy
could
make
it
harder
for
the
country
to
remain
within
eu
rules
however
benjamin
schroeder
rates
strategist
at
ing
said
he
did
not
expect
the
eu
to
demand
more
fiscal
tightening
from
italy
should
its
forecasts
be
reduced
the
eu
has
another
thing
to
deal
with
brexit
and
the
other
thing
is
do
you
want
to
infuse
the
campaign
ahead
of
the
parliamentary
elections
with
this
the
next
major
trigger
for
markets
will
more
likely
be
any
breakthrough

the

sides
meet
in
beijing
next

president
donald
trump
offered
little
new
to
chew
on
in
his
state
of
the

speech
but
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
on
wednesday
he
and
other
officials
will
aim
to
clinch
a
deal
next
week
to
avert
a
march
increase
in
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
probably
more
pressing
though
for
the
markets
is
the
threat
of
another
government
shutdown

with

at

the

approaching
swiftly
on

we
could
be
back
where
we
were
just
a

from
