german
industrial
output
unexpectedly
fell
in
december
for
the
fourth
consecutive
month
sending
another
signal
that
growth
in
europe
s
biggest
economy
is
weakening

analysts
said
the

makes
it
more
likely
that
the
economy
contracted
in
the
fourth
quarter

would
translate
into
a
recession

domestic
product
fell
in
the

after
nearly
a
decade
of
steady
growth
the
german
economy
has
been
facing
headwinds
from

and
both
china

britain
s
possible
departure
from

next
month
without
a
deal
is
also
clouding
the
outlook
for
german
manufacturers
december
s
drop
in
industrial
output
was
led
by
the
construction
sector
where
activity
shrank
by
more
than
percent
which
could
not
be
offset
by
a
small
rise
in
manufacturing

ministry
said
the
auto
sector
which
has
been
a
drag
on
the
economy
because
new
emissions
standards
translated
into
fewer

registrations
rebounded
in

output
rose
by
more

said

a

would
have
reduced
the
chance
of

signs
of
a
slowdown
have
prompted
the
government
to
revise
down
its

forecast
for
this
year
to
percent
industry
groups
and
economists
have
said
complacency
on
the
economy
from
chancellor
angela
merkel
is
also
contributing
to
the
slowdown
they
have
urged
her
to
grant
families
and
businesses
more
generous
tax
cuts
and
enact
tax
reforms
that
give
women
and
the
unemployed
more
incentives
to
join
the
workforce
merkel
is
also
facing
calls
to
make
germany
more
attractive
to
foreign
workers
to
plug
critical
labour
shortages
weaker
growth
or
stagnation
in
germany
could
have
implications
for
the
whole
euro
zone
whose
largest
economy
acts
as
a
bellwether
of
the
economic
health
of
the
single

bloc
private
consumption
has
been
providing
impetus
for
the
german
economy
as
exports
weaken
but
economists
suspect
the
slowdown
in
manufacturing
has
been
spreading
to
services
firms
who
depend
mostly
on
the
domestic
market
for
growth
those
suspicions
were
confirmed
by
the
dihk
chambers
of
industry
and
commerce
which
on
thursday
revised
down
its
growth
forecast
for
this
year
to
percent
from
percent
the
disappointing
output
data
came
after
separate
figures
released
on
wednesday
showed
that
industrial
orders
had
unexpectedly
fallen
for
the
second
month
in
a
row
