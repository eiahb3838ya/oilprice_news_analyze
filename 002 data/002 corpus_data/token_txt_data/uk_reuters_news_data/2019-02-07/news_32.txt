update 1-world's largest wealth fund to press firms for climate data at agms
oslo
reuters
norway
s
trillion
wealth
fund
will
push
the
firms
it
invests
in
to
disclose
more
data
on
greenhouse
gases
they
emit
and
how
they
adapt
to
climate
change
during
the
coming
annual
general
meeting
season
a
top
fund
official
said
the
world
s
largest
sovereign
wealth
fund
invests
the
revenues
of
norway
s
oil
and
gas
production
and
has
stakes
in
some
companies
across
countries
it
was
an
early
mover
among
international
investors
in
trying
to
assess
climate
change
risk
wanting
to
avoid
investments
in
one
sector
negatively
impacting
another
externalities
and
hurting
its
overall
portfolio
this
year
it
will
make
a
fresh
push
on
firms
to
explain
how
their
business
will
be
affected
and
how
they
are
adapting
to
a
world
where
temperatures
may
rise
by
degrees
celsius
what
we
would
like
to
see
more
of
is
scenarios
including
a
scenario
and
we
want
better
disclosure
of
the
assumptions
for
these
scenarios
carine
smith
ihenacho
the
fund
s
chief
corporate
governance
officer
told
reuters
we
want
clear
targets
for
emissions
and
other
greenhouse
gases
including
methane
and
we
want
to
see
reporting
of
progress
against
the
targets
she
added
we
would
like
to
see
it
more
disaggregated
meaning
not
for
the
whole
company
but
more
broken
down
for
instance
regional
or
even
on
an
asset
as
part
of
its
green
push
the
fund
has
been
developing
an
software
called
angle
that
can
take
data
such
as
emissions
combine
it
with
trading
data
and
earnings
data
and
see
how
it
will
affect
a
company
years
ahead
that
tool
has
informed
divestments
in
some
companies
in
fund
ceo
yngve
slyngstad
told
reuters
helping
show
that
these
companies
did
not
have
a
sustainable
business
model
over
the
he
did
not
name
them
presentation
material
showed
two
of
the
divested
companies
were
involved
in
palm
oil
one
in
rubber
ten
in
power
and
one
in
intensity
the
next
step
in
the
software
s
development
first
disclosed
by
reuters
in
october
is
to
develop
the
platform
to
see
how
much
of
the
carbon
cost
can
be
passed
on
to
customers
and
how
much
companies
must
pay
themselves
it
is
still
in
the
works
slyngstad
said
smith
ihenacho
said
companies
were
generally
better
at
reporting
data
citing
for
instance
banks
and
oil
and
gas
companies
as
quite
good
examples
but
others
like
power
producers
were
lagging
there
is
still
far
to
go
for
many
companies
to
report
at
the
level
we
would
like
to
see
she
said
the
fund
itself
emitted
million
tonnes
of
carbon
dioxide
equivalents
in
via
its
ownership
stakes
roughly
twice
the
amount
emitted
by
norway
in
according
to
its
annual
responsible
investment
report
released
on
thursday
in
the
fund
voted
against
one
or
more
resolutions
put
forward
at
percent
of
agms
it
attended
last
year
roughly
the
same
level
as
in
the
fund
said
it
voted
against
the
ceo
also
holding
the
position
of
board
chairman
at
amazon
johnson
johnson
total
procter
gamble
and
pfizer
among
others
it
also
voted
against
executive
pay
proposals

verizon
astrazeneca
and
glaxosmithkline
among
others
