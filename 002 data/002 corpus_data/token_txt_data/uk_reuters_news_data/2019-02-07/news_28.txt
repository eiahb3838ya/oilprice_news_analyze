loss
knocked
percent
off
its
share
price
the
european
steel
sector
is
navigating
choppy
waters
as
the
car
industry
one
of
its
main
customers
is
slowing
and
pressure
on
oil
prices
has
dampened
demand
from
the
oil
equipment
industry
voestalpine
issued
its
second
profit
warning
in
four
months
in
january
and
its
statement
on

states
and
china
holding
back
growth
he
said
he
does
not
expect
a
major
downturn
in
the
steel
sector
but
more
pressure
on
prices
largely
due
to
weakening
demand
in
china
we
will
see
more
pressure
again
from
imports
from
other
countries
into
europe
he
said
on
a

call
urging
politicians
not
