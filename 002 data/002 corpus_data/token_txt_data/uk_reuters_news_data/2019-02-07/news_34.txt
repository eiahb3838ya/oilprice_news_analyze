australia will easily meet paris climate accord target - study

australia
is
on
track
to
meet
its
carbon
emissions
target
under
the
paris
climate
accord
well
before
thanks
to
increasing
growth
in
wind
and
solar
power
a
study
has
found
contradicting
a
report
last
month
calling
for
sharper
emissions
cuts
with
several
big
wind
and
solar
farms
opening
over
the
past
year
and
rapidly
growing
installation
of
rooftop
solar
panels
australia
is
adopting
renewable
energy
faster
per
capita
than
the
rest
of
the
world
said
a
study
published
by
australian
national
university
anu
researchers
on
friday
the
pipeline
of
new
wind
and
solar
systems
is
averaging
about
gigawatts
gw
a
year
the
study
showed
based
on
the
new
renewable
energy
that
has
started
in
australia
since
last
june
and
is
expected
over
the
next
few
years
emissions
will
drop
sharply
from
the
power
sector
offsetting
possible
increases
from
other
sectors
such
as
transport
and
farms
the
anu
researchers
calculated
each
extra
gigawatt
of
renewables
displaces
about
million
tonnes
of
carbon
dioxide
equivalent
emissions
from
power
the
study
said
implying
australia
s
pipeline
of
renewables
would
cut
emissions
by
about
million
to
million
tonnes
of
equivalent
a
year
assuming
other
sectors
emissions
grow
by
million
tonnes
of
equivalent
a
year
the
net
reduction
would
be
about
million
to
million
tonnes
a
year
which
would
put
australia
on
track
to
meet
its
paris
target
before
by
this
time
next
year
it
ll
be
quite
obvious
to
everybody
that
something
really
surprising
has
happened
in
the
greenhouse
accounts
said
the
study
s
lead
researcher
andrew
blakers
an
engineering
professor
the
additional
australian
renewables
equate
to
watts
per
person
a
year
compared
with
about
watts
per
person
for
the
european
union
japan
china
and
the
united
states
the
study
said
australia
is
far
and
away
the
renewable
energy
superstar
in
terms
of
annual
per
capita
deployment
blakers
said
the
study
based
on
data
from
australia
s
clean
energy
regulator
was
not
commissioned
by
anyone
he
said
to
meet
australia
s
paris
climate
accord
commitment
to
cut
carbon
emissions
by
percent
to
percent
from
levels
by
emissions
would
have
to
fall
to
between
million
and
million
tonnes
of
equivalent
as
of
the
end
of
emissions
had
risen
to
million
tonnes
of
equivalent
according
to
data
from
australia
s
national
greenhouse
gas
inventory
extrapolating
from
that
figure
the
organisation
of
economic
cooperation
and
development
said
last
month
australia
needed
to
cut
emissions
more
sharply
to
meet
its
paris
target
as
the
country
remained
heavily
dependent
on
power
