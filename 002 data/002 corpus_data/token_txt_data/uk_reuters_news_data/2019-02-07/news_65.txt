investors
are

and
as
the

days
drift
by

then
markets
become
more
and
more
concerned
said
nick
twidale
analyst
at
rakuten
securities
australia
probably
more
pressing
for
the
markets
is
the
threat
of
another
government
shutdown
twidale
added

standing
firm
on

the

approaching

we

be
back
where
we
were
just
a

weeks
overnight
on

street
the
dow
fell
percent
while
the

p
lost
percent
and
the

percent
in

markets
the
early
mover
was
the
new
zealand
dollar
which
slid
after
data
showed
unemployment
job
gains
and
wages
growth
all
missed
forecasts
the
figures
present
a
more
modest
picture
of
the
labour
market
over
the
last

said
michael
gordon
senior

soft

growth
and
hours

increase
the
risk
of
another
weak
economic
print
in
the
december
the

slid
to

nearly

rba
caused
ripples
on

when
it
tempered
a

indicated
the

could
just
as

be
down
as

the

dollar
duly
dived

gave
a
broad
fillip
to

the

index
has
now
risen
for
five

reach
recovering
almost
all
the

abandoned

for

less
lucky
was
the
euro
which
was
dragged
back
to
in
the
wake
of
a
dismal
reading
on
german
industrial
output
the

could
make
no
headway
on
