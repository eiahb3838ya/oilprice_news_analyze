ethiopia
s
addis
ababa
university
doctoral
student
hailu
geremew
fantasises
about
working
on
the
nuclear
reactor
his
country
is
now
pondering
building
oh
that
is
my
dream
my
dream
my
dream
said
the
nuclear
physicist
wearing
rectangular
glasses
and
a
cardigan
geremew
is
part
of
a
new
generation
of
african
scientists
whose
prospects
are
expanding
as
their
governments
team
up
with
foreign
powers
on
a
potential
to
electrification
for
now
south
africa
is
the
only
country
on
the
continent
operating
a
nuclear
power
plant
but
in
recent
years
at
least
seven
other
african
states
have
signed
agreements
to
deploy
nuclear
power
with
backing
from
russia
according
to
public
announcements
and
the
world
nuclear
association
wna
an
industry
body
geremew
first
heard
about
the
ambitious
nuclear
deal
ethiopia
had
struck
with
moscow
on
the
television
news
two
years
ago
the
next
day
his
university
department
was
buzzing
with
talk
about
it
ethiopia
s
memorandum
of
understanding
on
nuclear
cooperation
with
russia
paves
the
way
for
the
construction
of
a
nuclear
power
plant
and
a
research
reactor
in
the
long
term
said
frehiwot
woldehanna
ethiopia
s
state
minister
for
the
energy
sector
the
east
african
country
has
been
electrifying
rapidly
to
meet
rising
energy
demand
and
its
own
goal
to
become
the
biggest
power
exporter
on
the
continent
while
sticking
to
pledges
to
remain
a
low
emitter
of
greenhouse
gases
under
a
development
plan
addis
ababa
wants
to
raise
power
generation
to
more
than
megawatts
mw
from
current
capacity
of
just
over
mw
mainly
by
harnessing
hydro
wind
and
geothermal
sources
its
most
ambitious
project
under
construction
is
the
grand
renaissance
dam
on
the
nile
river
that
will
churn
out
mw
at
full
capacity
when
completed
within
the
next
four
years
according
to
ethiopian
electric
power
the
utility
but
woldehanna
worries
about
betting
on
an
abundance
of
water
for
the
country
s
main
source
of
electricity
as
droughts
become
more
frequent
with
rivers
sometimes
drying
up
you
can
not
fully
rely
on
hydropower
he
said
adding
that
nuclear
technologies
have
environmental
advantages
over
others
plans
for
a
nuclear
power
plant
in
ethiopia
remain
at
the
stage
but
the
country
is
serious
about
building
one
he
emphasised
with
africa
s
countries
generating
the
same
amount
of
power
as
spain
despite
a
population
times
larger
the
option
to
bring
electricity
access
to
their
people
on
a
bigger
scale
using
nuclear
energy
is
gaining
momentum
nearly
six
out
of
africans
still
lack
access
to
electricity
according
to
world
bank
data
like
ethiopia
emerging
nuclear
states
sudan
kenya
uganda
nigeria
rwanda
zambia
and
ghana
have
signed
agreements
with
russia
s
state
nuclear
corporation
rosatom
most
since
their
content
ranges
from
language
on
the
construction
of
nuclear
reactors
to
assistance
with
feasibility
studies
and
personnel
training
press
statements
show
rosatom
s
solutions
for
managing
spent
fuel
and
radioactive
waste
vary
from
country
to
country
but
are
normally
worked
out
at
the
later
stages
of
a
nuclear
programme
in
the
strictest
compliance
with
international
law
a
spokeswoman
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
chinese
nuclear
firms
have
also
taken
the
lead
in
the

masamaki
masanja
won
a
rosatom
competition
for
young
people
to
make
videos
about
africa
s
nuclear
potential
and
got
to
visit
the
novovoronezh
nuclear
power
plant
in
western
russia
in
it
was
said
the
mechanical
engineering
student
via
skype
the
experience
left
him
with
a
strong
sense
that
nuclear
power
should
be
adapted
quickly
for
africa
s
needs
african
nations
have
shown
an
interest
in
nuclear
because
coal
is
scarce
while
large
volumes
of
natural
gas
in
nigeria
and
tanzania
tend
to
be
exported
for
profit
said
jessica
lovering
of
a
report
atoms
for
africa
from
the
center
for
global
development
booming
populations
and
international
pressure
to
curb
greenhouse
gas
emissions
also
play
a
role
she
added
ethiopia
for
instance
has
pledged
under
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
to
curb
its
already
meagre
emissions
by
from
projections
by
the
paris
accord
agreed
in
by
about
nations
seeks
to
wean
the
global
economy
off
fossil
fuels
in
the
second
half
of
this
century
limiting
the
rise
in
average
temperatures
to
well
below
degrees
celsius
fahrenheit
above
times
ramping
up
nuclear
power
may
be
a
option
but
presents
dilemmas
such
as
the
high
cost
of
building
a
plant
and
setting
up
supporting
infrastructure
including
safe
management
of
nuclear
fuel
said
lovering
yet
gaining
access
to
large
amounts
of
cheap
electricity
from
nuclear
plants
that
run
could
boost
domestic
manufacturing
as
well
as
lighting
up
homes
she
said
some
political
observers
however
are
concerned
about
the
prospect
of
nuclear
reactors
backed
by
russia
in
some
countries
with
rebel
groups
and
weak
government
institutions
an
western
diplomat
who
asked
to
remain
anonymous
doubted
russia
s
assurances
it
would
collect
nuclear
waste
from
projects
it
helped
establish
you
could
end
up
with
very
unfortunate
situations
in
parts
of
africa
if
you
have
a
decaying
nuclear
power
plant
overrun
by
rebels
with
waste
that
s
not
going
away
he
said
multiple
requests
for
an
interview
with
russia
s
ambassador
in
ethiopia
were
declined
dirty
bombs
can
combine
conventional
explosives
like
dynamite
with
radioactive
material
such
as
nuclear
waste
noel
stott
a
south
researcher
with

a

tracks
the
implementation
of
international
treaties
highlighted
an
array
of
agreements
in
place
to
control
the
weaponisation
of
nuclear
technology
the
treaty
on
the
of
nuclear
weapons
to
which
all
african
countries
but
south
sudan
are
party
mandates
safeguards
to
secure
nuclear
material
for

and

chief

sara
zemui
said
ethiopia
s
plans
to
grow
and
modernise
its
energy
production
would
mean
businesses
and
more
jobs
frequent

enables
a
seamless
transition
to
generator
power
zemui
said
here
as
in
the
nearly
of
ethiopia
with
access
to
an
electricity
connection
power
cuts
and
associated
costs
are
caused
mainly
by
overloads
on
the
ageing
grid
said
tilahun
legesse
a
director
at
the
ethiopian
electric
utility
in
other
parts
of
africa
however
similar
daily
outages
are
due
to
insufficient
power
production
said
lovering
at
addis
ababa
university
assistant
professor
tilahun
tesfaye
can
not
wait
for
his
country
to
reap
the
benefits
of
a
nuclear
reactor
it
s
long
long
overdue
he
said
the
need
is
very
but
the
road
will
be
a
long
one
he
said
pointing
to
machinery
in
his
nuclear
physics
laboratory
the
largest
such
facility
in
this
country
of
million
people
it
could
take
years
for
ethiopia
to
build
a
nuclear
power
plant

yonas

director
of
addis
advocacy
group
forum
for
environment
said
green
activists
could
prove
another
hurdle
amid
debate
over
whether
nuclear
power
is
clean
energy
it
would
be
good
and
it
would
be
wise
also
to
better
capitalise
on
already
started
initiatives
such
as
hydropower
wind
energy
and
solar
energy
