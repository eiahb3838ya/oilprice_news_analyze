tanker
ship
loaded
up
on
ethanol
in
texas
and
set
off
for
asia
two
months
later
after
a
circuitous
journey
that
included
a
transfer
and
a
stop
in
malaysia
its
cargo
arrived
in
china
according
to
shipping
data
analyzed
by
reuters
and
interviews
with
malaysian
and
chinese
port
officials
at
the
time
the
roundabout
route
puzzled
global
ethanol
traders
and
ship
brokers
who
called
it
a
convoluted
and
costly
way
to
get
fuel
to
china
map
but
the
journey
reflects
a
broader
shift
in
global
ethanol
flows
since
president
donald
trump
ignited
a
trade
war
with
china
last
spring
although
china
slapped
retaliatory
tariffs
up
to
percent
on
ethanol
shipments
the
fuel
can
still
legally
enter
china
if
it
arrives
blended
with
at
least
percent
fuel
according
to
trade
rules
established
between
china
and
the
association
of
southeast
asian
nations
asean
the
regional
economic
and
political
body
in
a
striking
example
of
how
global
commodity
markets
respond
to
government
policies
blocking
free
trade
some
tonnes
of
ethanol
landed
on
malaysian
shores
through
november
of
last
year
all
since
june
shortly
after
china
hiked
its
tax
on
shipments
the
surge
follows
years
of
negligible
imports
of
ethanol
to
malaysia
in
turn
malaysia
has
exported
tonnes
of
ethanol
to
china
the
first
time
the
nation
has
been
an
exporter
of
the
fuel
in
at
least
three
years
according
to
chinese
import
data
blending
and
asian
ethanol
for
the
chinese
market
undermines
the
intent
of
beijing
s
tariffs
and
helps
struggling
american
ethanol
producers
by
keeping
a
path
open
to
a
major
export
market
that
would
otherwise
be
closed
global
commodity
markets
are
incredibly
creative
in
finding
ways
to
ensure
willing
sellers
are
able
to
meet
the
demands
of
willing
buyers
geoff
cooper
head
of
the
renewable
fuels
association
said
in
a
statement
to
reuters
the
group
represents
ethanol
producers
in
at
least
two
cases
examined
by
reuters
including
that
of
the
high
seas
blending
of
ethanol
cargoes
with
other
products
appeared
to
have
occurred
in
malaysia
before
the
cargoes
were
shipped
on
to
china
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of
shipping
records
and
interviews
with
port
officials
chinese
merchants
including
the
oil
company
unipec
notified
chinese
authorities
about
the
unusual
activity
last
summer
which
represented
competition
they
had
not
anticipated
under
the
tariff
scheme
according
to
two
industry
sources
unipec
s
parent
company
sinopec
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
a
spokesman
for
china
s
general
administration
of
customs
declined
to
comment
norazman
ayob
deputy
secretary
general
of
the
malaysian
trade
ministry
confirmed
that
malaysia
exported
ethanol
to
china
this
year
the
ministry
was
unable
to
confirm
whether
it
had
been
mixed
with
fuel
he
said
but
noted
such
blending
would
be
legal
under
the
pact
malaysia
has
no
track
record
of
significant
domestic
ethanol
production
so
it
is
unclear
where
the
ethanol
blended
with
the
product
originates
additional
ethanol
has
flowed
in
unusual
volumes
to
other
destinations
since
trump
s
trade
war
began
including
other
asean
member
nations
the
philippines
and
indonesia
