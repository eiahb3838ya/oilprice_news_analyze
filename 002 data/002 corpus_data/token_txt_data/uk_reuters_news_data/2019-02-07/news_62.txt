canada
s
struggling
oil
industry
is
looking
to
what
is
known
as
partial
upgrading
technology
to
thin
its
crude
and
squeeze
more
of
it
through
congested
pipelines
it
is
the
latest
effort
by
the
alberta
provincial
government
to
rescue
an
industry
hurt
last
year
by
steep
discounts
for
its
oil
as
production
far
exceeded
pipeline
capacity
the
government
has
already
forced
output
cuts
given
subsidies
to
petrochemical
plants
and
said
it
would
invest
in
trains
to
move
crude
alberta
in
january
announced
a
c
million
loan
guarantee
for
a
c
partial
upgrading
facility
planned
by
private
company
value
creation
the
plant
would
turn
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
diluted
bitumen
into
medium
crude
oil
and
diesel
starting
in
producing
a
medium
grade
would
give
the
world
s
producer
more
of
a
different
type
of
crude
to
sell
that
does
not
compete
with
abundant
light
shale
oil
most
of
the
oil
produced
in
canada
is
thick
heavy
crude
that
comes
from
northern
alberta
s
oil
sands
some
is
then
put
through
a
full
upgrading
process
at
great
cost
turning
that
crude
into
synthetic
light
oil
other
heavy
crude
must
be
diluted
with
light
oil
an
extra
expense
to
travel
through
pipelines
our
crude
oil
would
have
a
tailor
fit
to
refineries
so
we
would
have
no
problem
to
find
the
market
value
creation
chief
executive
columba
yeung
said
in
an
interview
partial
upgrading
is
not
yet
done
on
a
commercial
scale
anywhere
it
removes
sulfur
and
other
impurities
to
create
lighter
grades
of
oil
that
do
not
require
dilution
to
move
through
pipelines
lowering
costs
and
making
shipping
more
efficient
in
the
united
states
imported
million
barrels
of
medium
sour
crude
per
day
only
percent
of
which
came
from
canada
according
to
ihs
markit
there
s
a
case
to
be
made
for
product
diversification
said
ihs
vice
president
kevin
birn
the
timing
for
partial
upgrading
comes
with
risks
however
alberta
s
new
democratic
party
government
is
facing
a
tough
spring
election
and
by
the
time
the
first
upgrader
is
finished
in
additional
pipeline
capacity
may
be
open
reducing
the
urgency
to
remove
diluent
from
shipments
to
free
up
space
the
opposition
united
conservative
party
would
review
the
viability
of
any
subsidized
energy
projects
if
it
forms
a
government
said
prasad
panda
the
party
s
energy
critic
several
pipelines
in
the
works
would
raise
canada
s
export
capacity
to
million
bpd
creating
a
surplus
of
space
until
according
to
the
canadian
energy
research
institute
yeung
counters
that
additional
pipelines
would
only
enhance
opportunities
for
partially
upgraded
oil
to
reach
markets
developers
of
a
dozen
partial
upgrading
technologies
including
meg
energy
corp
are
undeterred
however
and
hope
value
creation
s
plant
is
only
the
first
among
the
other
companies
grappling
with
ways
to
help
alleviate
alberta
s
problem
is
fractal
systems
which
intends
to
profit
mainly
by
removing
and
reselling
diluent
from
heavy
crude
field
upgrading
has
a
tiny
bpd
pilot
plant
that
it
hopes
to
scale
up
to
bpd
by
to
produce
heavy
oil
suitable
for
marine
shipping
the
technology
produces
fuel
compliant
with
tougher
shipping
emission
requirements
that
take
effect
next
year
said
neil
camarta
it
s
really
important
that
we
get
some
of
these
technologies
out
of
the
lab
and
into
development
because
there
s
potential
there
