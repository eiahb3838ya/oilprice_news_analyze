on

agl
which
has
the
nation
s
biggest
fleet
of
power
plants
said
it
would
hold
off
from
buying
back
shares
shares
in
the
company
fell
nearly
percent
in
a
broader
market
that
was
up

the
firm
on
thursday
abandoned
its
target
to
and
halved
its
target
for
the
year
to
june
to
a
million
million
taking
into
account
the
extra
spending
on
its
coal
fleet
that
spending
comes
after
breakdowns
at
a
number
of
plants
including
agl
s
loy
yang
recently
led
to
blackouts
as
supply
was
unable
to
meet
soaring
cooling
demand
amid
a
brutal
heatwave
in
southeastern
australia
we
ve
made
some
active
decisions
this
year
to
really
focus
on
our
plant
availability
and
ensure
we
ve
got
the
generation
there
when
we
need
it
acting
chief
financial
officer
damien
nicks
told
analysts
on
a
conference
call
as
a
result
we
have
additional
agl
s
underlying
profit
for
the
six
months
to
which
excludes
items
rose
to
a
million
from
a
million
at
the
same
time
last
year
boosted
by
strong
wholesale
power
prices
agl
said
it
was
on
track
to
hit
the
midpoint
of
its
forecast
range
for
underlying
profit
of
between
a
million
and
a
billion
in
the
year
to
june
roughly
flat
on
last
year
revenue
slipped
percent
to
a
billion
the
company
said
last
august
that
average
wholesale
power
prices
which
had
jumped
over
the
previous
two
years
following
the
closure
of
two
power
plants
by
two
of
its
rivals
likely
peaked
in
as
we
look
into
the
future
some
of
the
lead
indicators
of
profitability
like
the
wholesale
electricity
prices
are
pointing
to
a
flatter
to
slightly
lower
future
redman
told
analysts
agl
and
its
rivals
including
origin
energy
and
energyaustralia
owned
by
hong
kong
s
clp
holdings
have
come
under
pressure
from
the
government
to
cut
power
prices
to
homes
and
businesses
as
rocketing
energy
costs
have
become
a
hot
political
issue
but
redman
said
the
government
s
proposed
big
stick
legislation
designed
to
lower
prices
and
the
lack
of
a
broader
energy
policy
was
deterring
it
from
going
ahead
with
a
billion
in
new
generation
investments
there
is
no
question
that
policy
and
regulatory
uncertainty
is
contributing
to
delays
in
both
executing
and
approving
projects
