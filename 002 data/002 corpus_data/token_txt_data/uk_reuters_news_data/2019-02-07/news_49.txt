world
shares
ground
to
a
halt
on
thursday
as
the
dollar
scored
its
longest
winning
streak
since
a
hot
run
in
early
october
that
helped
set
off
a
wave
of
global
bear
markets
some
poor

and
weak
data
out

ensured
europe

heading
for
only
its
second
run
of
falls
of
the
year
so
far
the
extent
of
the
current
slowdown
in
the
global
economy
was
highlighted
as
india
unexpectedly
cut
its
interest
rates
and
the

got
hit

also

almost
all

elsewhere
the
pound
was
struggling
near
again
ahead
of
a
bank

meeting
while
gloomy
jobs
data
saw
new
zealand
s
dollar
suffer
a
similar
flop
as
its
australian
counterpart
had
seen
the
previous
day
the
kiwi
slid
to
losing
nearly
percent
in
the
past
hours
as
investors
wagered
on
the
risk
of

the

its

meeting

msci

outside

added
percent
as
it
rose
to
its
highest
since
early
october
the
index
has
risen
steadily
since
early
january
as
the
federal
reserve
changed
its
tune
and
emerging
markets
have
surged
more
broadly
after
a
torrid
australia
s
benchmark
stock
index
jumped
percent
amid
expectations
of
easy
monetary
policy
after
the
country
s
central
bank
chief
shifted
away
from
his
previous
tightening
bias
japan
s
nikkei
slipped
percent
though
and
the
caution
quickly
spread
to
europe
london
s
ftse
was
the
only
major
bourse
clinging
to
positive
territory
whereas
the
rest
were
down
at
least
percent
as
were
futures
for
the
s
p
and
dow
one
of
the
day
s
big
surprises
came
from
india
where
its
central
bank
unexpectedly
lowered
interest
rates
to
percent
to
boost
a
slowing
economy
after
a
sharp
slide
in
the
inflation
rate
italy
s
bonds
were
back
under
pressure
with
the
european
commission
slashing
its
growth
forecast
italy
agreed
a
deficit
target
of
percent
in
december
averting
a
major
with
the
eu
though
this
was
based
on
a
growth
assumption
of
percent
slowing
growth
in
italy
could
make
it
harder
for
the
country
to
remain
within
eu
rules
however
benjamin
schroeder
rates
strategist
at
ing
said
he
did
not
expect
the
eu
to
demand
more
fiscal
tightening
from
italy
should
its
forecasts
be
reduced
the
eu
has
another
thing
to
deal
with
brexit
and
the
other
thing
is
do
you
want
to
infuse
the
campaign
ahead
of
the
parliamentary
elections
with
this
the
next
major
trigger
for
markets
will
more
likely
be
any
breakthrough
in
the
tariff
talks
when
the
two
sides
meet
in
beijing
next
week
president
donald
trump
offered
little
new
to
chew
on
in
his
state
of
the
union
speech
but
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
on
wednesday
he
and
other
officials
will
aim
to
clinch
a
deal
next
week
to
avert
a
march
increase
in
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
probably
more
pressing
though
for
the
markets
is
the
threat
of
another
government
shutdown
nick
twidale

rakuten

australia
said
with
both
sides
of
the
house
standing
firm
on
the
contentious
border
wall
issue
at
present
and
the
deadline
approaching
swiftly
on
feb
we
could
be
back
where
we
were
just
a
few
weeks
the
broad
dollar
gains
put
pressure
on
gold
which
eased
to
per
ounce
slipping
further
from
last
week
s
top
of
oil
prices
eased
too
after
crude
inventories
rose
and
as
production
levels
in
the
country
held
at
record
levels
brent
crude
futures
slipped
cents

eased
