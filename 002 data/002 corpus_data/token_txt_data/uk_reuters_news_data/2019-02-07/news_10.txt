natural

flows
to
liquefied
natural
gas
export
terminals
were
expected
to
increase
in
coming
days
after
collapsing
to
their
lowest
level
in
almost
a
year
as
fog
clears
along
the
gulf
coast
according
to
analysts
and
data
from
refinitiv
analysts
said
the
drop
was
due
to
maintenance
work
at
the
lng
terminals
and
the
pipelines
feeding
them
and
fog
which
forced
several
vessels
to
drop
anchor
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
now
that
the
fog
is
clearing
the
tankers
are
starting
to
move

those

pulled
just
billion
cubic
feet
per

of
gas
from
pipelines
on
thursday
down
from
a
record
bcfd
on
according
to
refinitiv
one
billion
cubic
feet
of
gas
is
enough
to
supply
about
five
million
homes
for
a
day
that
was
the
lowest
amount
of
gas
going
to
the
lng
terminals
since
late
february
most
of
the
pipeline
flow
declines
were
at
sabine
which
dropped
from
a
record
bcfd
in
early
january
to
bcfd
on
thursday
with
most
of
that
decrease
in
february
according
to
refinitiv
heavy
fog
high
winds
and
rough
seas
have
been
occurring
along
the
gulf
coast
since
and
many
ports
are
experiencing
traffic
suspensions
due
to
the
weather
conditions

pointlogic
with

deliveries
to

are
starting

recover
after
a

while
we
aren

sure
the
reason
for
the

shutdown
it
s
not
uncommon
for
