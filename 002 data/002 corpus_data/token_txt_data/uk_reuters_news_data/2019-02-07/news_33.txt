policymakers
and
analysts
who
claim
the
outlook
is
unusually
uncertain
are
normally
overstating
their
own
forecasting
problem
and
understating
the
difficulties
faced
by
their
predecessors
the
outlook
always
looks
more
certain
in
retrospect
when
the
outcome
is
known
and
a
causal
chain
can
be
constructed
that
makes
it
appear
nearly
inevitable
than
it
does
in
prospect
when
multiple
pathways
look
possible
unusually
uncertain
is
often
a
fancy
way
of
saying
i
don
t
know
and
concealing
the
limits
of
forecasting
which
is
often
much
less
reliable
than
policymakers
and
analysts
would
like
their
audience
to
believe
but
there
are
times
when
it
is
genuinely
more
difficult
to
predict
what
will
happen
in
future
especially
when
systems
approach
turning
points
or
inflection
points
i
am
normally
sceptical
when
policymakers
and
analysts
say
the
outlook
is
unusually
uncertain
but
at
the
moment
they
may
actually
be
justified
in
making
that
claim
with
the
economy
delicately
poised
between
moderation
and
recession
and
to
even
small
shocks
that
could
nudge
it
towards
either
eventuality
in
both
the
economy
and
the
oil
market
forecast
accuracy
deteriorates
around
cyclical
turning
points
which
is
why
almost
all
forecasters
missed
the
onset
of
the
last
recession
in
or
the
collapse
in
oil
prices
in
for
the
same
reason
most
forecasters
missed
the
slump
in
oil
prices
in
the
middle
of
the
recovery
in
oil
prices
from
early
or
the
renewed
fall
in
prices
during
late
the
largest
errors
in
forecasts
of
real
and
nominal
gdp
growth
inflation
and
the
unemployment
rate
are
made
in
the
vicinity
of
business
cycle
and
growth
cycle
turning
points
particularly
peaks
wrote
business
cycle
expert
victor
zarnowitz
many
forecasts
are
overly
influenced
by
the
most
recent
events
or
developments
they
rely
on
the
persistence
of
local
trends
and
are
insufficiently
cyclical
in
the
sense
that
they
miss
the
turns
and
underestimate
recessions
and
leading
indicators
rarely
miss
major
turns
in
economic
activity
but
they
now
and
then
err
in
giving
false
signals
of
recession
or
less
often
recovery

indicators
and
forecasting
zarnowitz
however
even
leading
indicators
may
struggle
to
discriminate
between
a
true
turning
point
where
the
cycle
changes
direction
and
an
inflection
point
where
the
cycle
continues
in
same
direction
but
with
a
change
of
rate
in
the
vicinity
of
a
turning
point
or
an
inflection
the
economy
and
the
oil
market
can
become
very
sensitive
to
even
small
changes
in
conditions
and
sentiment
which
contributes
to
the
increased
forecasting
difficulty
the
global
economy
and
the
oil
market
both
now
show
clear
signs
of
a
slowdown
every
leading
indicator
tells
the
same
story
of
a
sharp
loss
of
momentum
in
the
second
half
of
after
strong
growth
in
but
all
those
indicators
for
the
economy
and
the
oil
market
are
in
a
range
that
could
be
consistent
with
either
an
imminent
recession
or
a
renewed
acceleration
after
a
period
of
sluggish
growth
with
every
indicator
poised
between
a
true
turning
point
in
the
cycle
or
simply
an
inflection
in
the
growth
rate
there
is
no
way
to
discriminate
in
advance
chartbook
the
shape
of
the
treasury
yield
curve
is
one
commonly
employed
leading
indicator
for
predicting
recessions
in
the
united
states
based
on
the
current
shape
of
the
yield
curve
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
new
york
estimates
there
is
a
percent
probability
the
economy
will
be
in
recession
in
january
the
forecast
probability
of
recession
has
more
than
doubled
over
the
last
year
and
risen
six
times
over
the
last
two
years
and
is
now
unusually
elevated
but
the
forecast
probability
is
still
well
below
the
percent
hit
in
the
run
up
to
the
recessions
of
or
the
probability
looks
more
like
the
elevated
risk
in
which
turned
into
a
recession
or
and
which
did
not
based
on
the
yield
curve
it
is
impossible
to
say
whether
the
economy
is
heading
for
an
turning
point
or
a
temporary
slowdown
the
equity
market
is
similarly
hovering
uncertainly
between
an
slowdown
and
an
turning
point
the
s
p
equity
index
is
now
down
slightly
over
the
last
months
after
strong
gains
during
and
most
of
the
flattening
of
equity
prices
is
certainly
consistent
with
a
slowdown
in
the
economic
and
corporate
earnings
outlook
but
is
not
yet
at
levels
that
preceded
the
recessions
of
or
manufacturing
surveys
show
a
loss
of
momentum
at
the
end
of
and
the
start
of
a
warning
sign
but
the
composite
activity
indicators
are
still
well
below
the
levels
that
preceded
the
last
three
recessions
even
the
job
market
indicators
are
ambiguous
employment
is
rising
at
around
percent
per
year
faster
than
the
percent
reported
months
earlier
but
fairly
slow
compared
with
earlier
expansions
if
the
economy
is
performing
relatively
well
most
of
the
rest
of
the
global
economy
is
performing
relatively
poorly
but
not
so
badly
that
we
can
confidently
predicted
a
recession
rather
than
a
slowdown
china
s
official
purchasing
managers
index
shows
manufacturing
activity
has
been
losing
momentum
for
the
last
year
and
actually
contracted
in
december
and
january
but
only
slightly
globally
purchasing
managers
indicators
show
new
export
orders
have
been
losing
momentum
since
the
start
of
and
have
now
fallen
for
five
months
in
a
row
but
the
declines
in
orders
have
been
relatively
small
so
far
and
could
be
consistent
with
an
slowdown
such
as
or
rather
than
a
full
recession
like
or
air
freight
indicators
also
point
to
or
falling
volumes
in
after
strong
growth
in
and
but
do
not
yet
show
the
large
falls
associated
with
the
last
two
recessions
like
the
rest
of
the
economy
the
oil
market
appears
to
be
poised
uncertainly
between
the
probability
of
a
supply
surplus
or
a
deficit
opec
s
aggressive
output
cuts
coupled
with
sanctions
on
iran
and
venezuela
have
offset
the
feared
slowdown
in
oil
consumption
growth

eliminated
much
of

incipient

returned
close
to

after
collapsing
from

the
fourth

the

close
to

this

brent

as
the

alternates
between
periods
of

they
do
not
usually
stay
close
to
flat
for
very
long
but
the
outlook
is
poised
between
fears
about
a
slowdown
in
consumption
and
concerns
about
supply
losses
from
iran
and
venezuela
as
well
as
opec
cuts
and
a
possible
slowdown
in
shale
growth
the
global
economic
outlook
is
the
single
biggest
source
of
uncertainty
for
the
oil
market
and
until
that
source
of
uncertainty
is
resolved
or
at
least
reduced
the
oil
outlook
remains
equally
unclear
