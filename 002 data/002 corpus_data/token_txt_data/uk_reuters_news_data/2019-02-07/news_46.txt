vattenfall
will
look
to
invest
in
more
wind

magnus
hall
told
reuters
on
thursday
after
the
company
reported
lower
operating
profits
for
last
year
thanks
to
hedging
contracts
the
company
s
profit
will
be
little
affected
if
average
power
prices
fall
this
year
from
the
high
levels
seen
in
he
added
hedging
however
together
with
higher
spending
on
investment
and
a
lower
result
in
district
heating
as
fuel
costs
rose
was
behind
vattenfall
s
weaker
ebit
and
underlying
operating
profit
despite
increased
net
sales
average
power
prices
rose
last
year
in
europe
due
to
a
cold
winter
that
increased
demand
for
electricity
and
heat
combined
with
an
unusually
dry
and
warm
summer
that
affected
nuclear
power
plants
and
hydropower
dam
levels
we
are
trying
to
take
out
volatility
that
is
why
we
are
hedging
hall
said
we
will
be
looking
to
other
wind
projects
we
need
to
create
a
pipeline
so
we
have
projects
that
we
can
go
vattenfall
said
its
net
sales
rose
percent
to
billion
crowns
billion
but
its
earnings
before
interest
and
tax
ebit
and
underlying
operating
profit
fell
percent
and
percent
respectively
the
company
s
wind
power
business
which
vattenfall
aims
to
expand
grew
in
as
that
segment
s
underlying
operating
profit
jumped
to
billion
crowns
from
billion
a
year
before
in
contrast
vattenfall
s
heat
business
took
a
hit
with
profit
sinking
to
billion
crowns
from
billion
in
we
are
quite
disappointed
on
the
heat
side
but
we
will
continue
to
grow
in
the
district
heating
business
it
s
a
good
business
hall
said
wind
projects
will
be
the
biggest
part
of
vattenfall
s
investments
in
though
the
firm
will
also
boost
its
distribution
grid
in
sweden
and
germany
he
added
asked
whether
britain
s
scheduled
exit
from
the
european
union
would
affect
the
firm
s
operations
in
the
country
hall
said
he
saw
no
clear
risk
for
vattenfall
Î¹f
this
results
in
lower
economic
development
it
is
not
good
for
the
country
but
when
it
comes
to
vattenfall
operations
there
is
only
a
limited
risk
we
do
not
have
any
