france key as germany fights eu rules that threaten nord stream 2
feb
reuters
germany
is
pressuring
other
european
capitals
to
block
an
eu
proposal
to
regulate
russia
s
nord
stream
pipeline
ahead
of
a
key
meeting
on
friday
diplomatic
sources
said
but
may
fail
to
convince
france
threatening
the
project
s
construction
the
european
union
executive
wants
to
extend
its
internal
energy
market
laws
to
offshore
gas
pipelines
to
have
a
say
over
the
new
gas
link
under
the
baltic
sea
from
russia
to
germany
in
its
current
form
the
project
fully
owned
by
russian
state
energy
firm
gazprom
would
not
be
compliant
national
capitals
have
so
far
failed
to
agree
on
the
plan
with
big
member
states
such
as
france
italy
and
spain
unwilling
to
go
against
berlin
s
opposition
to
the
draft
rules
france
however
may
have
shifted
its
position
according
to
one
source
close
to
the
talks
opening
the
way
for
germany
to
lose
its
blocking
minority
on
the
eu
proposal
france
s
vote
would
be
decisive
another
eu
source
said
adding
that
spain
and
italy
have
not
taken
firm
sides
it
s
very
unpredictable
what
will
happen
french
officials
refused
to
comment
on
their
position
ahead
of
friday
s
meeting
in
brussels
with
an
elysee
source
saying
negotiations
were
still
ongoing
the
bloc
is
split
with
eastern
european
nordic
and
baltic
sea
countries
viewing
the
km
mile
pipeline
as
holding
the
eu
hostage
to
moscow
while
those
in
northern
europe
especially
germany
prioritise
the
economic
benefits
opponents
of
the
pipeline
including
the
united
states
worry
it
will
undermine
support
for
ukraine
by
depriving
kiev
of
gas
transit
fees
along
the
traditional
route
for
russian
supplies
which
fill
over
a
third
of
the
eu
s
gas
needs
the
german
government
has
said
gas
transits
through
ukraine
must
continue
as
a
condition
for
the
project
which
will
double
the
capacity
of
the
existing
nord
stream
pipeline
however
talks
between
russia
and
ukraine
to
agree
the
terms
of
such
transits
have
so
far
failed
if
the
european
commission
s
gas
regulation
proposal
musters
enough
support
from
the
bloc
s
member
states
negotiations
on
final
draft
rules
could
begin
as
early
as
next
week
as
the
european
parliament
has
already
backed
the
plan
how
fast
the
legislation
passes
is
critical
to
whether
the
pipeline
proceeds
it
foresees
tougher
rules
for
new
infrastructure
projects
but
nord
stream
construction
is
already
underway
any
delay
to
building
the
pipeline
would
weaken
moscow
s
hand
in
talks
with
ukraine
for
a
new
gas
transit
deal
after
and
create
uncertainty
for
gazprom
s
partners
