london
reuters
britain
s
government
has
no
plans
to
review
regulations
for
fracking
gas
in
the
country
it
said
on
thursday
following
calls
from
industry
to
revisit
the
rules
chemical
giant
ineos
and
fracking
firm
cuadrilla
earlier
this
week
said
current
restrictions
around
seismic
events
at
fracking
sites
could
force
the
industry
to
close
under
the
traffic
light
system
fracking
must
be
paused
for
hours
following
any
seismic
event
of
magnitude
or
above
something
which
forced
cuadrilla
to
halt
its
operations
several
times
last
year
we
set
these
regulations
in
consultation
with
industry
and
we
have
no
plans
to
review
them
a
spokesman
for
the
department
for
business
energy
and
industrial
strategy
said
in
an
email
the
government
however
said
it
still
believes
shale
gas
could
be
an
important
energy
source
for
the
country
and
the
industry
could
generate
economic
benefits
and
well
paid
jobs
cuadrilla
said
this
week
its
test
drilling
in
northwest
england
showed
a
rich
reservoir
of
high
quality
and
recoverable
gas
environmentalists
have
campaigned
against
fracking
saying
extracting
more
fossil
fuel
is
at
odds
with
britain
s
commitment
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
they
have
also
raised
concerns
about
potential
groundwater
contamination
