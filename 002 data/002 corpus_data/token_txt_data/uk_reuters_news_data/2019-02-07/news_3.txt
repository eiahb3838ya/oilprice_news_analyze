washington
reuters
democrats
on
thursday
laid
out
a
green
new
deal
that
would
eliminate
greenhouse
gas
emissions
within
a
decade
an
effort
to
make
climate
change
a
central
issue
in
the
presidential
race
the
document
unveiled
by
rising
political
star
representative
alexandria
and
senator
edward
markey
marks
the
first
formal
attempt
by
lawmakers
to
define
potential
legislation
to
create
big
investments
in
clean
energy
and
infrastructure
to
transition
the
economy
away
from
fossil
fuels
the
plan
which
takes
the
form
of
a
congressional
resolution
outlines
some
of
the
most
aggressive
climate
goals
ever
put
forward
by
democratic
lawmakers
and
clashes
dramatically
with
the
trump
administration
s
efforts
to
advance
domestic
oil
gas
and
coal
production
by
rolling
back
environmental
protections
the
name
green
new
deal
references
the
new
deal
of
the
that
president
franklin
roosevelt
implemented
to
aid
americans
suffering
in
the
great
depression
by
embarking
on
huge
infrastructure
projects
today
is
the
day
that
we
choose
to
assert
ourselves
as
a
global
leader
in
transitioning
to
percent
renewable
energy
and
charting
that
path
told
reporters
the
resolution
so
far
has
house
and
nine
senate
sponsors
four
of
whom
are
democratic
presidential
hopefuls
for
senators
kamala
harris
kirsten
gilibrand
corey
booker
and
elizabeth
warren
the
resolution
said
she
will
immediately
begin
to
work
on
legislation
that
would
fully
flesh
out
the
projects
involved
in
the
green
new
republicans
have
been
quick
to
criticize
the
initiative
waving
off
any
kind
of
proposal
as
the
trump
administration
does
not
believe
action
on
climate
change
is
necessary
and
is
focused
on
increasing
production
of
oil
gas
and
coal
on
federal
and
private
land
it
s
a
socialist
manifesto
that
lays
out
a
laundry
list
of
government
giveaways
including
guaranteed
food
housing
college
economic
security
even
for
those
who
refuse
to
work
republican
senator
john
barrasso
chair
of
the
senate
environment
and
public
works
committee
said
on
twitter
the
resolution
outlines
several
goals
for
the
united
states
including
meeting
percent
of
power
demand
from
energy
sources
like
wind
and
solar
within
years
the
plan
also
calls
for
new
projects
to
modernize
transportation
infrastructure
cut
carbon
emissions
from
the
manufacturing
and
agricultural
sectors
make
buildings
and
homes
more
energy
efficient
and
increase
land
preservation
the
plan
is
intended
to
address
the
latest
report
by
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
which
said
global
temperatures
must
be
kept
less
than
degrees
celsius
above
preindustrial
levels
to
avoid
the
most
severe
impacts
of
a
changing
climate
the
authors
of
the
policy
said
the
green
new
deal
also
aims
to
create
an
economic
safety
net
for
communities
that
will
be
affected
by
the
impacts
of
climate
change
and
the
shift
away
from
fossil
fuel
use
including
through
guarantees
of
healthcare
jobs
and
jobs
training
it
was
not
clear
how
the
programs
would
be
funded
we
need
to
be
sure
that
workers
currently
employed
in
fossil
fuel
industries
have
and
better
jobs
available
to
them
to
be
able
to
make
this
transition
and
a
federal
jobs
guarantee
ensures
that
no
worker
is
left
behind
according
to
a
summary
of
the
plan
the
green
new
deal
was
put
into
the
media
spotlight
by
a
youth
coalition
called
the
sunrise
movement
and
the
youngest
woman
to
serve
in
congress
members
of
the
group
have
already
put
pressure
on
democratic
presidential
hopefuls
and
plan
to
continue
lobbying
members
of
congress
next
week
to
support
the
resolution
greg
carlock
a
climate
researcher
with
data
for
progress
who
helped
author
the
green
new
deal
said
lawmakers
who
seek
middle
ground
policies
on
global
warming
risk
losing
youth
support
in
future
elections
they
will
not
accept
vague
endorsements
he
said
markey
said
on
thursday
that
despite
its
lofty
goals
the
green
new
deal
has
more
political
momentum
than
a
carbon
legislation
he
introduced
years
ago
the
difference
between
and
today
is
the
movement
that
has
now
been
built
he
said
this
is
going
enter
the
election
cycle
as
one
of
the
top
two
or
three
issues
for
every
candidate
