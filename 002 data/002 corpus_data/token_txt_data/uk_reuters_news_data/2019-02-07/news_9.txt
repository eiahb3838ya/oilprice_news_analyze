france
plans
to
back
an
eu
proposal
to
regulate
russia
s
nord
stream
pipeline
its
foreign
ministry
said
on
thursday
potentially
threatening
its
completion
and
dealing
a
blow
to
germany
which
has
been
trying
to
garner
support
for
the
project
the
european
union
executive
wants
to
extend
its
internal
energy
market
laws
to
offshore
gas
pipelines
before
construction
is
completed
giving
it
a
say
over
how
the
new
gas
link
under
the
baltic
sea
from
russia
to
germany
is
used
in
its
current
form
nord
stream
fully
owned
by
russian
state
energy
firm
gazprom
would
not
be
compliant
with
tougher
new
rules
foreseen
for
new
infrastructure
projects
diplomatic
sources
said
earlier
that
germany
had
been
pressuring
other
european
capitals
to
block
the
new
directive
france
intends
to
support
the
adoption
of
such
a
directive
work
is
continuing
with
our
partners
in
particular
with
germany
on
possible
changes
to
the
text
french
foreign
ministry
spokeswoman
agnes
von
der
muhll
said
in
a
briefing
any
delay
in
building
the
pipeline
would
create
uncertainty
for
gazprom
s
partners
germany
s
uniper
and
basf
s
wintershall
unit
shell
austria
s
omv
and
france
s
engie
the
eu
bloc
is
divided
in
its
support
for
the
project
eastern
european
nordic
and
baltic
sea
countries
view
the
km
mile
pipeline
as
holding
the
eu
hostage
to
moscow
while
those
in
northern
europe
especially
germany
prioritise
the
economic
benefits
an
eu
source
said
earlier
that
france
s
vote
would
be
decisive
likely
leaving
germany
short
of
a
blocking
minority
opponents
of
the
pipeline
worry
it
will
weaken
support
for
ukraine
by
depriving
kiev
of
gas
transit
fees
along
the
traditional
route
for
russian
supplies
which
fill
over
a
third
of
the
eu
s
gas
needs
the
ambassadors
to
germany
denmark
and
the
european
union
urged
eu
members
to
vote
against
the
pipeline
cancelling
the
project
would
send
a
clear
signal
that
moscow
can
not
get
away
unscathed
with
its
aggression
against
neighbouring
states
and
its
meddling
in
our
democracies
they
wrote
in
a
joint
published
by
deutsche
welle
on
thursday
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
nord
stream
would
not
make
germany
dependent
on
russia
for
gas
stressing
that
ukraine
must
remain
a
transit
country
do
we
become
dependent
on
russia
due
to
this
second
gas
pipeline
i
say
no
if
we
diversify
at
the
same
time
merkel
told
a
news
conference
in
bratislava
uniper
which
has
so
far
spent
about
million
euros
million
pounds
out
of
the
million
it
earmarked
for
the
project
said
its
assumption
was
that
nord
stream
would
still
be
realised
this
is
a
project
for
the
next
decades
and
therefore
to
a
certain
extent
independent
of
current
events
a
spokesman
for
the
group
said
a
spokesman
for
wintershall
said
the
group
would
closely
watch
any
further
developments
if
the
proposed
regulation
musters
enough
support
negotiations
on
final
draft
rules
could
begin
as
early
as
next
week
