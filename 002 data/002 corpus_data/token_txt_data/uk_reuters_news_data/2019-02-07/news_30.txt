tie
executive

to
the

the
oil
major
said
in
its
latest
climate
report
released
on
thursday
the
move
is
a
first
for
a
oil
major
and
focuses
on
the
company
s
oil
fields
more
investors
have
been
pressuring
san
ramon
chevron
and
other
big
oil
companies
to
reduce
emissions
that
contribute
to
climate
change
chevron
said
that
by
it
will
reduce
its
methane
and
flaring
intensity
by
percent
to
percent
from
levels
and
said
the
goal
would
be
added
to
the
scorecard
that
determines
incentive
pay
for
around
employees
it
s
about
the
mindset
and
the
culture
of
the
company
said
chevron
vice
president
mark
nelson
noting
that
including
most
of
its
global
workforce
would
harness
ideas
from
all
employees
among
other
oil
companies
bp
and
france
s
total
have
set
targets
on
reducing
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
to
their
own
operations
royal
dutch
shell
in

announced
it
would
link
executive
compensation
to
reducing
carbon
dioxide
emissions
starting
in
including
scope
emissions
from
fuels
sold
to
customers
around
the
world
chevron
s
report
said
it
does
not
support
establishing
scope
targets
exxon
s
latest
climate
report
published
on
tuesday
includes
a
goal
of
reducing
methane
emissions
from
operations
by
percent
and
flaring
by
percent
by
compared
with
levels
as
well
as
reducing
greenhouse
gas
intensity
at
its
canadian
oil
sands
facilities
by
percent
by
chevron
s
target
aims
to
reduce
emissions
and
flaring
as
a
percentage
of
production
but
does
not
set
a
goal
for
total
emissions
a
measure
that
activist
investors
prefer
the
targets
will
apply
to
chevron
s
operations
as
well
as
joint
ventures
or
assets
it
has
a
stake
in
but
does
not
operate
itself
the
company
said
methane
the
main
component
of
natural
gas
is
colorless
and
odorless
and
has
more
than
times
the
heat
trapping
potential
of
carbon
dioxide
in
the
first
years
after
it
escapes
into
the
atmosphere
scientists
say
methane
can
leak
from
oilfield
equipment
and
pipelines
or
is
flared
or
vented
during
maintenance
work
and
when
new
oil
wells
are
added
in
areas
that
don
t
have
natural
gas
pipelines
