shane

for
fiat
chrysler
in
north
america
said
in
a
statement
the
fuel
economy
program
should
be
reformed
rather
than
requiring
companies
to
make
large
compliance
payments
because
assumptions
made
in
turned
out
to
be

that
the
automaker
is
committed
to
improving
the
fuel
efficiency
of
our

administration
nhtsa
said
in
a
report
dated
that
the
industry
faced
million
in
fines
in
and
that
one
unnamed
manufacturer
is
expected
to
pay
significant
civil
the
agency
did
not
immediately
comment
on
thursday
the
civil
penalty
payment
is
much
higher
than
in
prior
model
years
the
industry
paid
million
in
civil
penalties
in
and
million
in
under
federal
rules
automakers
can
accrue
credits
for
overcomplying
in
some
years
in
the
obama
administration
finalized
rules
requiring
automakers
to
nearly
double
the
fuel
efficiency
of
vehicles
to
more
than
miles
per
gallon
by
but
the
trump
administration
has
proposed
rolling
back
those
requirements
starting
in
the
model
year
nhtsa
also
noted
that
the
number
of
automakers
fleets
with
credit
shortfalls
had
risen
to
in
up
from
in
and
the
number
of
surpluses
fell
from
in
to
steve
bartoli
a
fiat
chrysler
vice
president
who
oversees
fuel
economy
issues
said
in
september
at
a
public
hearing
on
the
fuel
rules
that
starting
in
the
auto
industry
had
been
unable
to
meet
current
requirements
without
using
credits
earned
from
prior
model
years
bartoli
called
the
gap
a
call
that
assumptions
made
seven
years
ago
about
the
auto
market
need
to
be
the
nhtsa
report
also
said
automakers
collectively
face
projected
shortfalls
of
about
billion
for
both
the
and
model
years
but
it
was
unclear
how
much
in
credits
can
be
used
to
offset
the
deficits
fiat
chrysler
said
the
payment
was
anticipated
and
the
costs
were
included
in
the
company
s
financial
results
released
on
thursday
the
company
has
previously
purchased
emissions
credits
from
tesla
inc
toyota
motor
corp
and
honda
motor
fiat
chrysler
paid
penalties
for
its
domestically
produced
car
fleet
that
did
not
meet
efficiency
requirements
it
noted
rules
governing
domestically
produced
cars
restrict
the
use
of
credits
the
company
explained
the
shortfall
in
part
by
noting
that
starting
in
the
model
year
some
utility
vehicles
previously
classified
as
trucks
were
moved
to
the
car
fleet
which
have
much
tougher
requirements
fiat
chrysler
noted
those
vehicles
are
taller
and
require
more
energy
than
sedans
in
the
company
produced
four
such
vehicles
the
dodge
journey
jeep
cherokee
jeep
compass
and
jeep
patriot
by
contrast
fiat
chrysler
said
its
average
fuel
economy
in
was
higher
than
toyota
ford
motor
co
and
general
motors
co
while
its
car
numbers
were
significantly
lower
the
trump
administration
said
last
year
the
fuel
economy
freeze
would
save
the
automakers
more
than
billion
in
regulatory
costs
trump
s
proposed
freeze
would
result
in
barrels
per
day
more
oil
consumption
by
the
year
california
says
the
proposal
would
worsen
air
quality
for
the
most
vulnerable
and
waste
billions
of
gallons
