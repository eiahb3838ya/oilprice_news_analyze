about
percent
on

as
the

was
weighed
down
by
concerns
that
global
demand
growth
would
lag
in
the
coming
year
a
rebound
from
late
december
lows
seemed
to
stall
amid
worries
that
a
trade
war
between
the
and
china
would
continue
weighing
on
demand
the
market
also
contended
with
the
possibility
that

not
adhere
strictly
to

crude
futures
fell
a
barrel
or
percent
to
settle
at
the
correction
is
stalled
mainly
on
concerns
about
demand
growth
said
gene
mcgillian
director
of
market
research
at
tradition
energy
in
stamford
connecticut
there
seems
to
be
uncertainty
about
what
is
going
to
happen
with
the
trade
talks
with
global
economic
growth
and
demand
in
the
coming
year
he
said
in
particular
he
said
the
market
is
worried
about
whether
demand
is
sufficient
to
absorb
growing
crude
production
from
the
supply
fundamentals
have
increasingly
been
turning
supportive
in
recent
weeks
but
against
this
the
market
still
worries
about
the
if
at
all
impact
on
demand
from
weaker
macroeconomic
fundamentals
said
ole
hansen
head
of
commodity
strategy
at
saxo
bank
though
the
united
states
published
robust
jobs
data
last
week
global
markets
remain
nervous
after
china
reported
the
lowest
annual
economic
growth
in
nearly
years
in
january
that
focuses
yet
more
attention
on
the
outcome
of
talks
to
end
the
trade
war
between
the
world
s
top
two
economies
the
oil
price
also
came
under
pressure
as
weekly
data
published
by
the
energy
information
administration
on
wednesday
showed
an
unwelcome
increase
in
stocks
of
crude
oil
a
decline
in
opec
production
and
a
squeeze
on
supply
from
iran
and
venezuela
because
of
sanctions
have
led
many
analysts
to
forecast
that
the
market
will
be
balanced
in
the
oil
price
is
showing
a
percent
gain
so
far
this
year
price
support
is
provided
by
supply
cuts
led
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
to
tighten
the
market
saudi
arabia
the
world
s
top
oil
exporter
told
opec
it
had
pumped
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
january
two
opec
sources
told
reuters
a
deeper
cut
than
targeted
in
the
supply
pact
the
kingdom
pumped
million
bpd
in
december
we
believe
that
financial
markets
may
be
overestimating
the
risks
of
a
global
recession
said

of

wealth
management
moreover
lower
oil
prices
prices
were
between
percent
and
percent
lower
in
january
than
their
average
are
likely
to
stimulate
economic
activity
and
oil
demand
particularly
in
emerging
sanctions
against
venezuela

to
