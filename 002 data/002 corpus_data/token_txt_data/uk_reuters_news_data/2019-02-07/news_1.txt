said
that
by
it
will
reduce
its
methane
and
flaring
intensity
by
percent
to
percent

said
the

would
be
added
to
the

pay
for
around
employees
it
s
about
the
mindset
and
the
culture
of
the
company
said
chevron
vice
president
mark
nelson
noting
that
including
most
of
its
global
workforce
would
harness
ideas
from
all
employees
chevron
though

not
address
reducing
the
company
s
full
carbon
footprint

danielle
fugere
president

includes
a
goal

reducing
methane
emissions
from
operations
by
percent
and
flaring
by
percent
by
compared
with
levels
chevron
s
target
aims
to
reduce
emissions
and
flaring
as
a
percentage
of
production
but
does
not
set
a
total
emissions
goal
a
measure
activist
investors
prefer
the
targets
will
apply
to
chevron
s
operations
as
well
as
assets
it
has
a
stake
in
but
does
not
operate
itself
the
company
said
this
is
the
first
public
link
between
methane
targets
and
joint
ventures
we
ve
seen
and
we
are
interested
in
how
they
will
actualize
and
validate
this
said
isabel
mogstad
of
the
environmental
defense
fund
methane
the
main
component
of
natural
gas
has
more
than
times
the
potential
of
carbon
dioxide
in
the
first
years
after
it
escapes
into
the
atmosphere
