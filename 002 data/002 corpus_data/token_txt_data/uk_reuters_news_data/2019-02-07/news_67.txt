california
utility
pg
e
corp
plans
to
increase
the
controversial
practice
of
shutting
off
the
power
to
communities
at
risk
of
wildfire
when
dangerous
conditions
such
as
high
winds
and
dry
heat
are
present
in
a
report
to
state
regulators
pg
e
said
it
would
also
remove
trees
near
electricity
lines
trim
vegetation
over
square
miles
square
km
and
conduct
thousands
of
inspections
to
prevent
its
equipment
from
sparking
wildfires
pg
e
is
under
intense
scrutiny
for
its
role
in
sparking
more
than
a
dozen
wildfires
over
the
past
two
years
it
filed
bankruptcy
last
month
citing
anticipated
liabilities
including
the
possibility
its
equipment
set
off
november
s
deadly
camp
fire
which
destroyed
the
northern
california
town
of
paradise
and
killed
people
the
san
utility
which
serves
million
customers
said
it
would
increase
nearly
tenfold
its
efforts
to
turn
off
the
power
to
communities
threatened
by
wildfire
increasing
the
number
of
households
and
businesses
potentially
affected
by
blackouts
in
to
million
such
shutoffs
were
also
used
last
year
to
keep
live
electricity
in
the
lines
from
setting
off
a
fire
when
high
winds
and
heat
hit
extreme
levels
and
nearby
brush
or
trees
could
be
ignited
mark
toney
who
directs
the
utility
consumer
advocacy
group
the
utility
reform
network
turn
said
shutting
off
power
would
harm
vulnerable
people
including
those
who
rely
on
electricity
to
power
medical
equipment
the
fact
that
there
is
such
a
dramatic
expansion
of
power
shutoffs
as
a
strategy
to
stop
wildfires
is
a
sign
of
pg
e
s
failure
and
mismanagement
when
it
comes
to
trimming
the
trees
and
taking
care
of
the
grid
he
said
pg
e
spokeswoman
kristi
jourdan
said
the
company
would
only
turn
off
the
power
to
a
community
as
a
last
resort
to
keep
people
safe
we
understand
and
appreciate
that
turning
off
the
power
affects
the
operation
of
critical
facilities
communications
systems
and
much
more
she
said
the
company
is
also
on
probation
in
relation
to
a
criminal
conviction
in
the
deadly
explosion
of
one
of
its
natural
gas
lines
in
the
city
of
san
bruno
near
san
francisco
the
judge
in
that
case
said
he
would
consider
the
company
s
wildfire
plan
in
deciding
whether
pg
e
should
do
more
to
prevent
wildfire
