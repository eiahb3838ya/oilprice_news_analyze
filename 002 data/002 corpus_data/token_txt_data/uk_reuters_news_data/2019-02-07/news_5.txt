trading houses hit speed bumps in reselling venezuelan oil -sources
reuters
trading
houses
that
resell
venezuelan
crude
oil
have
not
yet
found
workarounds
since
the
united
states
announced
sanctions
to
cut
off
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
s
revenue
according
to
shipping
data
and
sources
merchants
trading
partners
and
venezuela
s
pdvsa
were
expecting
oil
swaps
and
triangulation
of
sales
to
be
the
easiest
ways
to
continue
shipping
as
has
happened
when
sanctions
were
imposed
on
other
nations
such
as
iran
and
russia
but
the
measures
tougher
and
deeper
than
past
sanctions
have
for
now
blocked
a
large
portion
of
trading
in
venezuelan
oil
worldwide
as
are
reluctant
to
take
cargoes
leaving
barrels
stranded
in
the
atlantic
basin
according
to
data
from
refinitiv
eikon
the
lack
of
venezuelan
oil
has
refiners
scrambling
for
replacements
and
threatens
global
trade
that
is
worth
billion
a
year
the
sanctions
are
affecting
trading
firms
including
trafigura
and
vitol
which
regularly
offer
venezuelan
oil
to
refiners
and
petrochina
co
ltd
which
along
with
russia
s
rosneft
recoup
money
lent
to
venezuela
by
reselling
pdvsa
barrels
almost
million
barrels
remain
stuck
in
tankers
waiting
for
payment
or
discharge
instructions
according
to
eikon
data
most
are
anchored
in
the
gulf
coast
as
president
juan
guaido
rushes
to
set
up
escrow
accounts
to
receive
proceeds
trading
companies
have
also
delayed
loadings
of
venezuelan
oil
scheduled
by
pdvsa
for
february
delivery
according
to
sources
and
data
because
merchants
are
having
trouble
finding
buyers
no
one
who
typically
takes
venezuelan
crude
from
us
is
lifting
a
single
barrel
a
trafigura
trader
said
referring
to
barrels
offered
on
the
spot
market
buyers
are
not
sure
of
the
risks
and
how
to
ensure
any
payments
are
not
remitted
to
to
be
sure
pdvsa
has
not
stopped
exporting
there
are
more
than
a
dozen
tankers
in
the
water
headed
for
destinations
like
india
china
and
singapore
that
have
loaded
since
sanctions
were
imposed
on
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
data
most
vessels
will
not
arrive
at
their
destinations
for
several
weeks
but
they
are
for
like
india
s
reliance
industries
ltd
which
pays
for
venezuelan
crude
by
cash
and
oil
swaps
those
exports
if
completed
would
amount
to
about
million
barrels
per
day
short
of
the
million
bpd
average
for
the
three
previous
months
according
to
eikon
the
sanctions
limit
refiners
to
paying
into
escrow
accounts
that
can
not
be
accessed
by
maduro
s
government
effectively
cutting
off
shipments
foreign
firms
that
engage
in
oil
trading
involving
the
financial
system
or
units
are
similarly
restricted
trafigura
told
reuters
the
firm
is
following
all
applicable
vitol
did
not
immediately
comment
but
has
previously
said
that
it
is
compliant
with
sanctions
petrochina
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
trading
houses
lifted
some
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
venezuela
s
crude
and
fuel
in
or
percent
of
overall
exports
according
to
pdvsa
s
internal
data
seen
by
reuters
sales
could
flow
temporarily
if
european
branches
of
oil
firms
and
trading
houses
find
a
way
to
sell
venezuelan
crude
in
currencies
other
than
dollars
but
europe
is
also
mulling
sanctions
meaning
the
window
could
close
quickly
petrochina
which
resells
venezuelan
oil
to
customers
in
destinations
from
the
united

to
singapore
has
recently
reduced

scheduled
to
load
barrels
of

oil
bound
for
rotterdam
netherlands
but
the
oil
has
not
been
loaded
in
part
due
to
sanctions
according
to
two
sources
involved
in
the
case
as
