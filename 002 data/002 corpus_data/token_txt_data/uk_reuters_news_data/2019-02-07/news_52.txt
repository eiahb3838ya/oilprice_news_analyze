said
on
thursday
total
said
it
had
made
a
significant
gas
condensate
discovery
after
drilling
its
brulpadda
prospects
on
block
in
the
outeniqua
basin
it
is
gas
condensate
and
light
oil
mainly
gas
there
are
four
other
prospects
on
the
licence
that
we
have
to
drill
it
could
be
around
billion
barrels
of
total
resources
of
gas
and
condensate
pouyanne
said
the
brulpadda
well
encountered
metres
of
net
gas
condensate
in
lower
cretaceous
reservoirs
the
well
was
extended
to
a
final
depth
of
metres
and
has
also
been
successful
with
this
discovery
total
has
opened
a
new
gas
and
oil
play
and
is
well
positioned
to
test
several
prospects
on
the
same
block

africa
s
most
industrialised

statement
south
africa
wants
to
build
its
gas
network
and
has
previously
mentioned
the
possibility
of
importing
lng
from
mozambique
where
a
gas
pipeline
already
supplies
most
of
the
gas
south
africa
uses
to
power
its
industrial
heartland
in
the
north
the
proximity
of
the
find
to
mossel
bay
s
plant
is
also
a
boon
said
national
oil
and
gas
company
petrosa
we
potentially
could
be
supplied
by
total
with
gas
and
condensate
which
means
the
gtl
refinery
can
be
ramped
up
it
is
currently
running
below
