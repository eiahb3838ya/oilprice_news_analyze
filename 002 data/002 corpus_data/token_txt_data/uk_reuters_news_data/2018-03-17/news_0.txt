against
the

major
party
governs
incoming
liberal
premier
steven
marshall
gave
his
televised
victory
speech
just
after
local
time
it
is
a
tough
job
but
i
tell
you
what
i
m
really
looking
forward
to
it
it
s
a
new
dawn
for
south
with
percent
of
votes
counted
it
was
expected
the
liberals
had
won
of
the
lower
house
seats
giving
it
a
majority
to
form
government
in
what
may
have
national
implications
for
renewable
energy
policy
the
vote
was
seen
as
a
choice
between
solar
and
wind
energy
pushed
by
labor
and
coal
backed
by
australian
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
s
conservative
government
south
australia
the
country
s
fifth
most
populous
state
has
the
most
wind
and
solar
power
but
the
highest
electricity
prices
in
the
country
its
million
citizens
suffered
repeated
blackouts
over
the
last
two
years
when
intermittent
wind
power
was
insufficient
and
power
from
coal
and
gas
was
unavailable
outgoing
labor
premier
jay
weatherill
had
announced
a
plan
in
february
to
create
a
network
of
home
solar
systems
backed
by
tesla
powerwall
batteries
turnbull
mocked
the
state
s
renewables
policy
as
a
reckless
energy
experiment
that
created
the
highest
electricity
prices
in
the
developed
world
the
federal
government
wants
to
introduce
a
national
energy
policy
that
has
no
renewable
energy
target
but
sets
requirements
for
emissions
cuts
and
reliability
south
australia
s
labor
government
had
refused
to
go
along
with
it
energy
policy
specialist
david
blowers
at
the
grattan
institute
told
reuters
last
week
that
if
the
liberals
were
to
win
in
south
australia
the
federal
government
could
be
expected
to
get
the
approval
it
needs
to
proceed
the
south
australia
liberal
party
also
used
a
computer
program
to
intensify
lobbying
in
marginal
seats
for
the
first
time
in
this
election
the
app
imported
from
the
united
states
uses
information
gleaned
from
social
media
polls
and
surveys
to
pinpoint
vacillating
voters
addresses
and
the
issues
they
care
about
in
key
marginal
seats
so
they
can
be
targeted
for
lobbying
if
the
widget
is
credited
with
the
liberals
victory
it
may
become
more
widely
used
in
future
elections
the
official
result
of
the
final
vote
tally
may
not
be
known
for
several
days
