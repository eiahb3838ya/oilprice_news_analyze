marathon
petroleum
corp
the
refining
company
in
the
united
states
has
asked
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
for
a
hardship
waiver
exempting
one
of
its
facilities
from
the
nation
s
biofuels
law
two
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
application
told
reuters
the
request
comes
as
the
epa
expands
its
use
of
biofuel
waivers
in
a
way
that
has
reduced
regulatory
costs
for
the
oil
industry
by
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
recent
months
but
which
has
also
infuriated
the
powerful
corn
lobby
epa
has
authority
to
grant
waivers
freeing
small
refineries
from
their
obligation
to
mix
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
into
their
fuel
under
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
if
they
can
prove
complying
would
cause
them
disproportionate
economic
the
waivers
can
save
individual
facilities
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
in
regulatory
costs
adding
to
a
company
s
bottom
line
marathon
made
the
waiver
application
for
one
of
its
facilities
for
the
calendar
year
according
to
the
sources
who
asked
not
to
be
named
the
sources
did
not
specify
which
facility
the
waiver
would
cover
and
did
not
know
whether
epa
had
made
a
decision

spokesman
jamal
kheiry
declined
to
comment

epa
spokesman
jahan
wilcox
did
not
respond
to
requests
for

marathon
s
smallest
refinery
is
a
barrel
per
day
plant
in
canton
ohio
while
that
plant
has
a
nameplate
capacity
above
the
bpd
threshold
that
epa
uses
for
small
refineries
the
facility
could
meet
the
criteria
by
operating
at
reduced
rates
refineries
typically
bring
down
units
at
least
once
a
year
for
maintenance
work
limiting
production
it
is
also
possible
that
marathon
made
the
request
for
a
portion
of
one
of
its
larger
refining
complexes
such
as
its
galveston
bay
refinery
in
texas
arguing
that
certain
parts
of
the
complex
operate
distinctly
an
epa
source
said
earlier
this
year
that
the
agency
has
granted
more
than
two
dozen
small
refinery
waivers
for
in
recent
months
a
level
that
former
officials
say
is
about
triple
the
number
given
each
year
under
previous
administrations
the
expanded
use
of
biofuel
waivers
under
president
donald
trump
s
administration
has
been
a
flashpoint
between
the
oil
and
corn
industries
while
refining
industry
representatives
have
said
epa
is
required
to
provide
such
exemptions
to
qualifying
facilities
republicans
have
said
the
program
is
being
abused
in
a
way
that
hurts
corn
farmers
republican
senator
chuck
grassley
of
iowa
said
in
an
emailed
statement
that
the
move
was
a
sign
of
how
broken
this
process
note
to
epa
definition
of
hardship
a
condition
that
is
difficult
to
endure
suffering
deprivation
oppression
grassley
said
separately
on
twitter
surely
marathon
doesn
t
qualify
for
a
waiver
they
had
a
net
income
of
in
billions
in
profits
isnt
he
and
other
lawmakers
have
pressed
the
epa
to
curb
the
exemptions
and
to
name
the
companies
that
have
received
them
epa
does
not
reveal
the
names
of
waiver
applicants
or
recipients
arguing
the
information
is
confidential
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
have
told
reuters
that
large
refiner
andeavor
and
billionaire
carl
icahn
s
cvr
energy
were
among
the
companies
that
had
been
granted
waivers
recently
showing
epa
is
willing
to
award
exemptions
to
plants
owned
by
big
profitable
companies
andeavor
which
recorded
net
profits
of
billion
in
said
this
month
it
saved
million
in
costs
from
waivers
majors
chevron
corp
and
exxonmobil
corp
have
also
asked
for
relief
for
smaller
units
according
to
sources
though
it
is
unclear
if
their
requests
were
granted
marathon
which
owns
six
refineries
and
sells
gasoline
through
independent
retailers
and
its
speedway
unit
booked
net
income
of
billion
in
it
recently
announced
it
is
buying
andeavor
in
a
billion
deal
that
would
make
it
the
nation
s
largest
refiner
this
is
the
theater
of
the
absurd
marathon
wants
a
small
refinery
hardship
waiver
at
the
very
moment
it
is
seeking
to
become
the
nation
s
largest
refiner
brooke
coleman
head
of
the
advanced
biofuels
business
council
said
the
federal
government
should
be
protecting
consumers
by
scrutinizing
mergers
like
this
instead
of
handing
out
dividends
to
multibillion
dollar
oil
companies
seeking
to
monopolize
critical
energy
prices
of
the
biofuel
blending
credits
that
refiners
need
to
prove
compliance
with
the
rfs
known
as
renewable
identification
numbers
rins
have
fallen
to
lows
in
recent
weeks
as
the
increase
in
hardship
waivers
has
turned
traditional
buyers
of
credits
into
sellers
marathon
has
long
called
for
a
legislative
overhaul
of
the
rfs
to
ease
the
burden
on
refiners
but
began
investing
years
ago
in
terminal
blending
capacity
to
help
curb
its
rin
expenses
chief
financial
officer
and
senior
vice
president
timothy
griffith
in
april
told
investors
and
analysts
on
a
conference
call
that
the
costs
associated
with
the
rfs
are
incorporated
into
our
trading
and
pricing
decision
and
ultimately
recovered
and
