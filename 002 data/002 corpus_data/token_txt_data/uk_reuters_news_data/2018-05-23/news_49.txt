the

began
hearing
an
appeal
from
some
of
the
owners
of
the
gassled
gas
network
involving
government
cuts
to
pipeline
tariffs
in
june
a
norwegian
appeals
court
ruled
against
the
owners
in
a
lawsuit
that
argued
the
cut
in
tariffs
was
unlawful
and
would
cost
them
a
combined
billion
norwegian
crowns
billion

lost
earnings

announced
they
were
selling
their

but
will
still
remain
in
line
for
any
potential
proceeds
from
a
decision
in

of
the
gassled
partners

the
cost
of
litigation
some
of
the

transportation
tariffs
would
hurt
the
