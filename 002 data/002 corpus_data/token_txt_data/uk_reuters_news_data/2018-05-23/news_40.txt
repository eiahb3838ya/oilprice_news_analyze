china's independent refiners embrace old friend fuel oil as taxes, rising crude, bite margins
beijing

reuters
china
s
independent
oil
refiners
are
once
again
using
fuel
oil
to
feed
their
plants
as
stricter
tax
enforcement
and
rising
crude
oil
prices
have
squeezed
their
margins
these
independent
refiners
nicknamed
teapots
buy
nearly
of
china
s
crude
imports
and
any
reduction
in
their
crude
purchases
would
cap
demand
in
what
is
now
the
world
s
biggest
oil
importer
two
independent
refiners
based
in
the
eastern
province
of
shandong
home
to
most
of
china
s
teapots
have
each
bought
an
tonne
cargo
of
fuel
oil
srfo
cargo
together
totalling
about
million
barrels
for
april
and
may
delivery
according
to
three
traders
with
knowledge
of
the
deals
one
cargo
is
arriving
from
abu
dhabi
and
the
other
from
singapore
said
one
of
the
sources
an
executive
with
a
western
trader
involved
in
the
supply
talks
the
independents
had
primarily
used
fuel
oil
the
residue
left
after
crude
oil
has
been
initially
distilled
in
a
refinery
as
a
feedstock
for
their
plants
since
it
cost
less
than
crude
oil
and
was
taxed
less
however
in
the
chinese
government
raised
taxes
on
fuel
oil
imports
but
that
was
followed
in
by
teapots
winning
licences
to
import
crude
fuel
oil
consumption
slumped
as
the
refiners
bought
crude
oil
which
yielded
a
higher
volume
of
products
such
as
gasoline
and
diesel
than
the
srfo
when
processed
and
boosted
profit
margins
for
the
teapots
china
remained
a
large
buyer
of
cracked
fuel
oil
as
fuel
for
ships
however
starting
on
march
beijing
enacted
new
tax
rules
that
more
rigidly
enforced
on
the
teapots
the
collection
of
a
per
barrel
gasoline
consumption
tax
and
per
barrel
tax
on
diesel
combined
with
a
recent
surge
in
crude
oil
prices
to
their
highest
since
the
higher
tax
collection
has
crushed
the
independent
s
margins
that
has
prompted
the
renewed
interest
in
fuel
oil
buying
srfo
may
not
necessarily
save
tax
cost
as
the
buyer
needs
to
pay
the
fuel
oil
consumption
tax
but
obviously
plants
are
exploring
the
old
trade
as
the
government
s
tax
stick
is
really
a
hard
one
this
time
said
the
oil
trading
executive
processing
the
srfo
does
have
an
added
tax
benefit
however
the
independents
can
deduct
the
tax
of
about
per
barrel
paid
on
their
fuel
oil
imports
from
the
consumption
tax
they
are
required
to
collect
on
their
gasoline
and
diesel
sales
said
an
official
with
an
independent
plant
seeking
fuel
oil
processing
fuel
oil
gives
better
margins
than
refining
crude
oil
as
plants
can
get
tax
deducted
when
selling
refined
fuel
later
the
official
said
the
source
who
declined
to
be
named
as
he
is
not
authorized
to
talk
to
press
added
that
his
plant
expected
margins
to
be
negative
if
they
only
processed
crude
oil
the
lower
margins
have
resulted
in
the
teapots
cutting
their
run
rates
in
early
may
the
independent
refiners
operated
at
only
percent
of
their
processing
capacity
the
lowest
since
february
during
the
lunar
new
year
break
according
to
a
weekly
survey
of
plants
by
consultancy
sublime
china
information
planned
maintenance
was
also
a
factor
said
gao
lei
an
analyst
with
sublime
we
ve
seen
less
impact
from
the
tax
measures
on
import
volumes
as
plants
increase
runs
but
more
on
teapot
margins
said

they
are
definitely
making
less
money
now
