following

s
comments
on
the

investors
were
also
eyeing

chief

francois
savary
said
increase
in
trade
was
a
major
reason
behind
the
synchronised
global
growth
and
if
you
blow
this
up
you
limit
the
opportunities
for
the

he

such
worries
were
underscored
by

pmi
data
which
showed
on
wednesday
that
the
euro

economy
was
slowing
more
sharply
than
previously
expected
the
data
along
with
the
global
sentiment
setbacks
sent
euro

yields
broadly
lower
while

slipped
to
an
low
after
retreating
sharply
on
tuesday
from
near

they
are
now
on
the
cusp
of
slipping
back
under
the
psychologically
significant
level

savary
was
more
sanguine
on
the
data
noting
that
growth
while
slowing
remained
healthy
but
he
warned
that
trade
issues
alongside
geopolitics
especially
the
reimposition
of
iran
sanctions
could
have
economic
consequences
associated
with
potentially
higher
inflation

inching

lower

sapped
some
of

more

lower

bond

traders
worldwide
are
now
waiting
for
federal
reserve
minutes
from
its
last
meeting
to
glean
clues
on
how
many
more
times
the
central
bank
might
raise
interest
rates
in
the
minutes
are
due
later
on
wednesday
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
rose
percent
and
the
euro
bore
the
brunt
with
a
loss
the
single
currency
also
fell
against
another
safe
asset
the
swiss
franc
touching
a
near
low
one
reason
for
the
euro
s
woes
is
italy
where
an
incoming
coalition
government
comprised
of
the
two
parties
the
league
and
looks
likely
to
implement
policies
that
could
add
to
the
country
s
big
debt
pile
and
see
rome
clash
with
the
european
union
italian

fell
in

reversing
the
modest

seen
on

to
a
new

the
premium
investors
demand
to
hold
italian
debt
versus
safer
german
bonds
rose
sharply
to
bps
the
spread
was
about
bps
at
the
start
of
may
italian
stocks
tumbled
percent
and
are
so
far
suffering
their
biggest
monthly
losses
since
investors
are
watching
to
see
if
the
eurosceptic
paolo
savona
would
be
appointed
to
the
economy
minister
position
it
is
a
major
blow
for
europe
potentially
savary
said
as
long
as
coalition
partners
play
the
game
of
speaking
unwisely
bond
yields
can
go
elsewhere
emerging
markets
remained
under
heavy
pressure
with
currencies
down
percent
across
the
board
the
selling
storm
was
concentrated
on
turkey
where
the
lira
fell
more
than
percent
bringing
losses
just
in
may
to
more
than
percent
turkish
bond
yields
have
jumped
to
almost
percent
more
than
bps
up
from
the
end
of
april
with
an
emergency
interest
rate
rise
looking
all
but
certain
i
doubt
the
turkish
central
bank
have
time
to
wait
until
june
for
the
scheduled
meeting
the
lira
is
in
freefall
and
concrete
steps
are
urgently
required
to
slow
down
this
quite
rapid
rate
of
depreciation
