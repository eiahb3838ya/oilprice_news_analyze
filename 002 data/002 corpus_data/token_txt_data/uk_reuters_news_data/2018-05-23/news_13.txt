global
stocks
pared
losses
and
the

cut
gains
on
wednesday
after
the
release
of
minutes
from
the
federal
reserve
s
may
meeting
amid
heightened
concerns
that
setbacks
to
trade
talks
would
undermine
world
economic
growth
president
donald
trump
said
trade
discussions
with
china
would
need
to
be
rerouted
saying
the
current
track
appeared
too
hard
to
get
done
and
any
agreement
reached
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
needed
a

the
remarks
came
a
day
after
trump
said
he
was
not
pleased
with
talks
reversing
a
rally
pegged
to
the
white
house
s
optimistic
comments
about
the
discussions
over
the
weekend
that
led
to
a
strong
rally
on
monday
the
selloff
was
tempered
however
after
the
fed
released
meeting
minutes
indicating
a
rate
hike
pace
which
tipped
the
s
p
nasdaq
and
russell
indexes
into
positive
territory
you
really
have
to
say
it
is
a
dovish
view
to
allow
inflation
to
go
a
little
bit
above
the
target
for
some
period
of
time
recognizing
that
we
have
had
a
long
long
run
of
low
inflation
mike

said
as
always
the

hurt
the
dollar
against
the

the
japanese
yen
strengthened
percent
at
per
dollar
but
the
greenback
managed
to
rise
to
a
high
against
the
euro
on
data

a
slowdown
in
european
business
activity
before

fed
minutes
release
the

lost

and
msci
s
gauge

another
reason
for
the
euro
s
woes
is
italy
where
an
incoming
coalition
government
comprised
of
the
two
parties
the
league
and
looks
likely
to
implement
policies
that
could
add
to
the
country
s
big
debt
pile
and

rome
clash
with
the

investors
were
also
eyeing
turkey
whose
central
bank
raised
interest
rates
by
basis
points
in
an
emergency
move
to
put
a
floor
under
the
plunging
lira
currency
turkey
s
central
bank
which
had
been
scheduled
to
hold
its
next
meeting
on
june
said
it
had
increased
its
top
interest
rate
to
percent
from
percent
the
lira
has
fallen
about
percent
so
far
this
year
to
a
series
of
record
lows
but
the
currency
reversed
course
after
the
central
bank
decision
and
was
about
percent
firmer
on
the
day
at
to
the
dollar
at
gmt
investors
have
sold
off
their
lira
holdings
on
concerns
about
loose
monetary
policy
particularly
after
recent
comments
by
president
tayyip
erdogan
a
enemy
of
interest
elsewhere
oil
fell
after
an
unexpected
build
in
crude
and
gasoline
inventories
despite
strong
demand
and
as
traders
weighed
the
possibility
of
an
increase
in
opec
crude
output
to
cover
any
shortfalls
in
supply
from
iran
and
venezuela
crude
fell

last
at
up
