france
s
foreign
minister
said
on
wednesday
he
disagreed
with
the
united
states
decision
to
scrap
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
warned
that
its
method
of
adding
more
sanctions
on
tehran
would
reinforce
the
country
s
hardliners
we
disagree
with
the
method
because
this
collection
of
sanctions
which
will
be
set
up
against
iran
will
not
enable
dialogue
and
on
the
contrary
it
will
reinforce
the
conservatives
and
weaken
president
rouhani
this
posture
risks
endangering
the
region
more
le
drian
told
france
inter
radio
he
said
paris
would
continue
to
implement
the
agreement
even
if
it
did
agree
with
the
that
iran
s
ballistic
missile
activity
and
regional
hegemonic
ambitions
needed
to
be
curbed
