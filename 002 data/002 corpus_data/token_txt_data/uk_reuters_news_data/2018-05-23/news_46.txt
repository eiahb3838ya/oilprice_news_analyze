update 1-trump factor leaves macron scrambling ahead of russia trip
paris
reuters
emmanuel
macron
heads
to
st
petersburg
on
thursday
seeking
to
win
concessions
from
vladimir
putin
but
with
ties
strained
over
iran
the
russian
leader
may
have
little
incentive
to
offer
the
french
president
a
diplomatic
success
a
year
after
hosting
putin
in
the
regal
halls
of
the
chateau
de
versailles
macron
will
seek
common
ground
on
syria
and
ukraine
during
a
visit
and
moscow
s
help
in
salvaging
the
iran
nuclear
deal
abandoned
by
president
donald
trump
the
weakness
of
the
transatlantic
relationship
does
not
give
macron
sufficiently
strong
positions
to
counter
putin
said
tatiana
director
of
the
russia
centre
at
the
institute
for
international
relations
putin
knows
that
there
are
differences
in
the
western
camp
and
as
soon
as
someone
shows
weakness
he
exploits
macron
has
banked
on
nurturing
relationships
with
awkward
leaders
such
as
putin
appearing
engaged
on
the
world
stage
but
remaining
and
trying
to
mediate
among
opposing
sides
without
unsettling
anyone
that
policy
is
now
being
tested
after
trump
shunned
macron
and
other
close
allies
and
imposed
extraterritorial
sanctions
on
iran
having
already
pulled
out
of
the
global
climate
pact
and
threatened
the
eu
with
tariffs
on
metals
the
move
has
left
paris
london
and
berlin
scrambling
to
rescue
the
nuclear
deal
knowing
their
interests
are
not
necessarily
aligned
with
the
two
remaining
signatories
russia
and
china
macron
hopes
to
entice
all
sides
into
a
grand
bargain
that
would
tackle
tehran
s
nuclear
programme
and
also
address
fears
over
its
ballistic
missile
activity
and
regional
influence
as
a
means
to
bringing
the
united
states
back
into
the
fold
we
must
have
a
frank
dialogue
with
russia
but
also
a
demanding
dialogue
foreign
minister
le
drian
told
france
inter
radio
a
senior
french
diplomat
was
more
direct
a
lot
needs
to
be
done
to
convince
the
russians
because
it
has
interests
in
the
middle
east
especially
syria
and
its
stance
towards
the
west
is
rather
than
confronting
putin
directly
in
public
macron
has
favoured
private
dialogue
and
pushed
for
a
restoration
of
business
and
cultural
ties
despite
european
union
sanctions
on
moscow
invited
as
guest
of
honour
to
an
economic
forum
at
which
french
firms
including
total
societe
generale
and
sanofi
will
be
present
macron
will
on
friday
trumpet
improved
trade
ties
that
have
seen
french
exports
steadily
recover
after
a
drop
in
but
his
broad
strategy
has
shown
its
limits
over
the
last
year
moscow
has
not
shifted
on
syria
where
it
continues
to
back
president
bashar
militarily
or
in
ukraine
where
last
week
putin
again
excluded
the
restoration
of
crimea
annexed
in
yet
even
after
britain
accused
russia
of
orchestrating
a
attack
on
its
soil
further
souring
ties
macron
has
stressed
that
ostracising
moscow
would
not
yield
results
i
felt
the
eagerness
of
this
dynamic
young
and
ambitious
man
to
quickly
find
concrete
solutions
but
alas
in
life
it
is
a
little
more
complicated
the
solution
in
syria
as
in
ukraine
depends
not
only
on
us
or
the
french
but
other
actors
former
russian
ambassador
to
france
alexander
orlov
told
reuters
nevertheless
there
is
this
positive
approach
on
the
part
of
president
macron
and
he
is
ready
to
cooperate
with
russia
to
find
few
see
any
likelihood
of
a
breakthrough
on
ukraine
however
french
diplomats
hope
the
risk
of
a
direct
confrontation
between
israel
and
iran
in
syria
and
the
lack
of
a
syrian
political
transition
process
will
encourage
putin
to
yield
some
ground
but
highlighting
just
how
macron
s
efforts
have
been
he
sent
at
least
two
letters
to
putin
one
last
summer
and
one
at
the
end
of
the
year
outlining
concrete
areas
in
which
he
believed
putin
could
pressure
assad
to
ease
humanitarian
access
in
the
country
neither
letter
drew
a
response
beyond
france
s
prestige
and
commercial
opportunities
an
effective
french
diplomacy
must
ask
what
levers
it
can
use
recalcitrant
actors
said
jalel
harchaoui
a
geopolitics
researcher
at
paris
university
it
seems
this
basic
question
is
no
longer
being
asked
in
paris
when
you
conduct
foreign
policy
without
a
carrot
or
a
stick
that
s
what
you
