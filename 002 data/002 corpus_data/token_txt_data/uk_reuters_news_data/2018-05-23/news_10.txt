latest
in
a
string
of
talks
among

officials
seeking
ways

help
merchant
refiners
like
valero
energy
corp
reduce
the
costs
of
complying
with
the
renewable
fuel
standard
without
hurting
farmers
in
the
nation
s
heartland
trump
has
told
some
lawmakers
he
wants
to
do
so
by
expanding
sales
of
gasoline
blends
counting
ethanol
exports
toward
mandated
biofuels
volumes
and
scaling
back
the
number
of
waivers
that
the
epa
can
provide
to
small
refiners
to
free
them
from
the
regulation
a
set
of
proposals
that
includes
concessions
to
both
sides
the
white
house
was
expected
to
release
the
plan
last
week
but
was
delayed
the
sources
said
and
thursday
s
meeting
is
expected
to
focus
on
hashing
out
any
remaining
legal
and
political
obstacles
to
the
proposals

epa
deputy

andrew
wheeler
energy
department
deputy

dan
brouillette
and

deputy

the

house
spokeswoman
kelly

epa
spokesman
jahan
wilcox
agriculture
department
spokesman
jake
wilkins
and
energy
department
spokeswoman
shaylyn
hynes
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
the
rfs
requires
refiners
to
blend
increasing
amounts
of
ethanol
or
other
biofuels
into
the
nation
s
fuel
each
year
and
prove
compliance
by
handing
in
blending
credits
that
can
be
either
earned
or
purchased
the
regulation
has
created
a
billion
gallon
annual
market
for
ethanol
a
major
boon
to
the
corn
industry
but
has
also
angered
refiners
which
say
that
the
policy
costs
them
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
a
year
in
recent
months
the
epa
has
granted
more
than
two
dozen
exemptions
from
the
regulation
to
small
refineries
to
help
the
refining
industry
cope
with
the
costs
about
triple
the
typical
level
under
past
administrations
infuriating
the
corn
lobby
which
claims
the
waivers
hurt
ethanol
demand
cutting
the
waiver
program
back
is
a
key
demand
of
the
biofuels
industry
the
proposal
to
allow
ethanol
exports
to
qualify
for
credits
under
the
rfs
meanwhile
has
been
welcomed
by
refiners
as
a
means
of
reducing
compliance
costs
but
has
drawn
criticism
from
the
powerful
corn
lobby
which
fears
that
it
amounts
to
a
subsidy
and
will
trigger
a
trade
war
conversely
expanding
the
sales
of
blends
of
gasoline
known
as
during
the
summer
months
is
seen
as
a
big
win
for
the
biofuel
industry
and
a
setback
for
refiners
because
it
will
boost
seasonal
demand
for
corn
and
displace
petroleum
in
americans
gas
tanks
republican
senator
joni
ernst
of
iowa
said
she
was
eager
to
see
that
change
implemented
pruitt
has
been
dragging
his
feet
