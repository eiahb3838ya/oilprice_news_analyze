s
second
largest
city
hamburg
will
ban
the
most
polluting
diesel
vehicles
from
two
major
streets
from
next
week
a
move
that
could
spur
others
to
follow
suit
and
raise
pressure
on
carmakers
to
consider
costly
vehicle
refits
hamburg
home
to
around
million
people

on

the
ban
would
start

should
consider
bans

last
friday
showed

authorities
were
entitled
to
implement
targeted
bans
with
immediate
effect
to
bring
air
pollution
levels
into
line
with
european
union
rules
although
curbs
affecting
wider
city
areas
should
only
be
phased
in
over
time
bans
on
diesel
vehicles
from
city
centres
are
also
planned
in
paris
madrid
mexico
city
and
athens

wants
to
bar

entering
the

driving
bans
like
those

show

the

the

levels
of
nitrogen
oxide
nox
emitted
by
