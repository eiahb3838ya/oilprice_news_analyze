reuters
china
will
import
record
volumes
of
oil
and
is
likely
to
ship
more
soy
after
beijing
signalled
to
refiners
and
grains
purchasers
they
should
buy
more
to
help
ease
tensions
between
the
two
top
economies
trade
sources
said
on
wednesday
china
pledged
at
the
weekend
to
increase
imports
from
its
top
trading
partner
to
avert
a
trade
war
that
could
damage
the
global
economy
energy
and
commodities
were
high
on
washington
s
list
of
products
for
sale
the
united
states
is
also
seeking
better
access
for
imports
of
genetically
modified
crops
into
china
under
the
deal
as
the
two
sides
stepped
back
from
a
trade
war
washington
neared
a
deal
on
tuesday
to
lift
its
ban
on
firms
supplying
chinese
telecoms
gear
maker
zte
corp
and
beijing
announced
tariff
cuts
on
car
imports
but
president
donald
trump
indicated
on
wednesday
that
negotiations
were
still
short
of
his
objectives
when
he
said
any
deal
would
need
a
different
structure
china
is
the
world
s
top
importer
of
both
oil
and
soy
and
already
buys
significant
volumes
of
both
from
the
united
states
it
is
unclear
how
much
more
chinese
importers
will
buy
from
the
united
states
than
they
would
have
otherwise
but
any
additional
shipments
would
contribute
to
cutting
the
trade
surplus
as
demanded
by
trump
asia
s
largest
oil
refiner
china
s
sinopec
will
boost
crude
imports
from
the
united
states
to
an
high
in
june
as
part
of
chinese
efforts
to
cut
the
surplus
two
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
on
wednesday
sinopec
s
trading
arm
unipec
has
bought
million
barrels
or
about
barrels
per
day
of
crude
to
load
in
june
they
said
the
largest
volume
ever
to
be
lifted
in
a
month
by
the
company
and
worth
about
billion
million
the
government
has
encouraged
us
to
lift
more
crude
one
of
the
sources
said
china
has
been
one
of
the
top
buyers
of
crude
exports
since
washington
lifted
a
ban
on
shipments
in
late
since
then
crude
exports
have
risen
rapidly
as
output
from
shale
fields
hits
record
highs
exports
are
straining
pipeline
and
port
capacity
and
may
be
reaching
a
limit
until
capacity
expansion
underway
are
completed
one
of
the
sources
said
we
want
to
buy
more
but
they
might
not
be
able
to
export
more
the
source
said
other
chinese
refiners
are
looking
to
reconfigure
their
plants
so
they
could
buy
and
process
oil
one
trade
source
said
in
agriculture
china
s
state
grain
stockpiler
sinograin
returned
this
week
to
the
soybean
market
for
the
first
time
since
early
april
two
sources
said
soybeans
are
america
s
top
agricultural
export
to
china
worth
billion
last
year
and
the
absence
of
chinese
buyers
from
the
market
had
left
farmers
wondering
if
their
biggest
buyers
was
going
to
want
their
next
harvest
sinograin
enquired
about
prices
for
soybeans
this
week
traders
said
which
market
participants
interpreted
as
a
sign
that
government
curbs
on
buying
american
goods
had
been
lifted
sinograin
is
in
the
market
today
asking
suppliers
to
make
offers
for
shipment
of
as
well
as
beans
for
shipment
august
onwards
said
a
source
who
works
at
a
private
soybean
crushing
company
in
china
it
is
a
clear
message
to
even
private
companies
that
it
is
ok
now
to
import
two
other
sources
briefed
on
the
matter
said
chinese
state
grain
trader
cofco
would
be
permitted
to
buy
soybeans
again
ending
restrictions
imposed
by
beijing
as
trade
tensions
rose
the
sources
declined
to
be
named
as
they
are
not
authorised
to
speak
to
the
media
sinograin
cofco
and
the
ministry
of
agriculture
and
rural
affairs
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
the
ministry
of
commerce
had
not
told
state
companies
to
increase
purchases
of
soybeans
a
ministry
spokeswoman
said
gulf
export
prices
for
the
new
soybean
crop
rose
on
tuesday
which
a
trader
said
may
indicate
a
revival
in
demand
from
china
exporters
were
lining
up
supplies
for
october
to
december
shipment
the
trader
said
improving
trade
relations
appeared
to
be
rekindling
interest
from
china
for
other
grains
traders
said
that
will
come
as
a
big
relief
to
farmers
who
saw
orders
cancelled
and
business
dry
up
as
washington
and
beijing
threatened
each
other
with
trade
tariffs
