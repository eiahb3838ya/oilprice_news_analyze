government
bonds
on
wednesday
as
concerns
rose
that
setbacks
to
trade
talks
would
undermine
world
economic
growth
president
donald
trump
said
trade
discussions
with
china
would
need
to
be
rerouted
saying
the
current
track
appeared
too
hard
to
get
done
and
any
agreement
reached
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
needed
a
different
the
remarks
came
a
day
after
trump
said
he
was
not
pleased
with
talks
reversing
a
rally
pegged
to
the
white
house
s
optimistic
comments
about
the
discussions
over
the
weekend
that
led
to
a
strong
rally
on
monday

trump
also
floated
plans
to
fine
china
s
zte
corp
and
cast
doubt
on
a
planned
june
summit
with
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
fears
over
the
further
dampening
of
relations
with
china
and
north
korea
weighed
on
equities
and
the
federal
reserve
s
may
meeting
minutes
due
for
release
on
wednesday
were
also
giving
investors
pause
analysts
said
a
combination
of
the
fed
and
the
trade
worries
will
make
today
a
rocky
session
said
peter
cardillo
chief
market
economist
at
spartan
capital
securities
in
new
york
the
minutes
which
could
indicate
the
number
of
rate
hikes
likely
this
year
are
expected
to
show
the
fed
taking
a
more
hawkish
tone
cardillo
said
broad
risk
aversion
hurt
the
dollar
against
the
japanese
yen
the
japanese
yen
strengthened
percent
at
per
dollar
but
the
greenback
managed
to
rise
to
a
high
against
the
euro
on
data
indicating
a
slowdown
in
european
business
activity
the
ftseurofirst
index
lost
percent
and
msci
s
gauge
of
stocks
across
the
globe
shed
percent
another
reason
for
the
euro
s
woes
is
italy
where
an
incoming
coalition
government
comprised
of
the
two
parties
the
league
and
looks
likely
to
implement
policies
that
could
add
to
the
country
s
big
debt
pile
and
see
rome
clash
with
the
european
union
italian
bonds
fell
in
value
reversing
the
modest
gains
seen
on
tuesday
and
yields
rose
basis
points
bps
to
a
new
high
the
premium
investors
demand
to
hold
italian
debt
versus
safer
german
bonds
rose
sharply
to
bps
investors
were
also
eyeing
turkey
which
is
seemingly
headed
for
a
economic
crisis
as
the
turkish
lira
plunged
to
record
lows
elsewhere
oil
fell
after
an
unexpected
build
in
crude
and
gasoline
inventories
despite
strong
demand
and
as
traders
weighed
the
possibility
of
an
increase
in
opec
crude
output
to
cover
any
shortfalls
in
supply
from
iran
and
venezuela
crude
fell
percent
to
per
barrel
and
brent
was
last
at
down
percent
