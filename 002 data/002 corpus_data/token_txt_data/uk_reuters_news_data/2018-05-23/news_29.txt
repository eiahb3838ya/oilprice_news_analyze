several

the

said
it
had
reached

that
it
would
propose
a
deal
once

former

after
his
conviction
on
charges
of
seeking
to
topple
the
government
of
president
denis
his
supporters
said
his
prosecution
was
an
attempt
by
who
has
ruled
congo
for
all
but
five
of
the
past
years
to
use
the
courts
to
stifle
dissent

christine
lagarde
on

requesting
that
congo
s
human
rights
situation
be
factored
into
any
decision
on
a
bailout
we
call
upon
the
imf
to
make
the
agreement
about

be
ratified
by
the
board
conditional
upon
the
end
of
repression
of
members
of
the
political
opposition
and
the
immediate
release
of
michel
mokoko
they
said
mokoko
finished
third
in
the
presidential
vote
and
was
arrested
later
that
year
congo
held
a
referendum
in
that
changed
the
constitution
allowing
to
seek
a
third
term
in
office
leading
to
protests
in
which
at
least
people
were
killed
by
security
forces
campaign
groups
say
the
human
rights
situation
has
worsened
since
the
referendum
over
opposition
activists
were
arrested
earlier
this
month
during
peaceful
protests
in
the
coastal
city
of
according
to
amnesty
international
the
imf
acknowledged
it
received
the
letter
but
would
not
say
whether
it
would
respond
to
the
demands
of
the
mokoko
s
legal
team
imf
lending
and
conditionality
decisions
are
based
on
considerations
that
fall
within
the
scope
of
its
mandate
as
a
specialised
agency
tasked
with
promoting
economic
and
financial
stability
it
said
while
the
fund
has
said
that
the
implementation
of
reforms
to
improve
governance
is
among
the
conditions
for
an
agreement
with
congo
it
has
made
no
specific
mention
of
human
rights
the
imf
said
congo
was
still
in
talks
with
its
creditors
which
include
commodities
traders
trafigura
and
glencore
to
make
its
debt
load
more
sustainable
