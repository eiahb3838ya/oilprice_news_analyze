oga
on
wednesday
awarded
licences
to
companies
to
explore
for
and
develop
new
fields
in
the
north
sea
in
the
latest
sign
of
confidence
in
the
ageing
basin
that
has
enjoyed
a
revival
in
recent
years
companies
ranging
from
royal
dutch
shell
rdsal
bp

the

a
statement
the
oga
expects
this
round
to
lead
very
quickly
to
activity
providing
a
welcome
boost
to
exploration
it
said
fourteen
of
those
licences
are
expected
to
progress
straight
to
field
development
planning
it
said
the
round
could
unlock
about
a
dozen
undeveloped
discoveries
containing
an
estimated
million
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
boe
it
added
the
north
sea
was
one
of
the
world
s
first
offshore
basins
and
has
produced
oil
for
more
than
four
decades
although
output
in
the
basin
has
sharply
declined
since
peaking
in
the
late
it
has
seen
a
revival
in
recent
years
after
large
projects
such
as
the
quad
in
the
western
shetlands
came
on
line
the
oga
estimates
the
north
sea
holds
reserves
of
billion
boe
the
oga
s
first
mature
licensing
round
following
the
norwegian
model
appears
to
have
been
a
great
success

swann
said
in
a
note
the
uk
is
in
desperate
need
of
new
projects
to
fill
a
development
pipeline
that
is
all
but
empty
beyond
the
early

wells
among
the
awards
with
big
companies
like
shell
bp
equinor
and
conocophillips
among
those
set
to
drill
is
a
big
vote
of
confidence
