brazil
s
agriculture
sector
is
one
of
the
hardest
hit
by
a
hike
in
diesel
prices
that
has
provoked
a
nationwide
trucker
strike
according
to
an
analysis
from
a
leading
university
released
on
wednesday
the
university
of
sao
paulo
s
college

agriculture
esalq
said
that
as
compared
to
early
farmers

now
paying
up
to
reais
more
per
tonne
to
move
grains
from
fields
in
mato
grosso
state
to
latin
america
s
largest
port
at
santos
brazil
is
a
key
global
supplier
of
grains
meat
coffee
and
sugar
most
of
which
reach
ports
by
road
the
esalq
study
estimated
that
the
cost
to
move
agricultural
goods
in
brazil
was
about
billion
reais
last
year
with
transportation
accounting
for
percent
of
that
figure
the
diesel
hike
is
a
tremendous
blow
to
the
sector
when
the
sheer
volume
of
products
is
considered
esalq
wrote
for
instance
brazil
is
expected
to
sell
about
million
tonnes
of
soybeans
in
export
markets
this
season
according
to
projections
by
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
usda
transport
lobby

which
estimates
that
percent
of
brazil
s
cargo
is
moved

for
a
revision
of
the
pricing
policy
of
brazil
s
oil
firm
petroleo
brasileiro
sa
brazil
s
diesel
fuel
is
more
expensive
than
in
countries
at
a
similar
stage
of
development
like
russia
and
mexico
cnt
said
in
a
wednesday
statement
adding
that
local
prices
are
on
average
about
percent
higher
than
in
the
united
states
diesel
fuel
prices
at
the
pump
rose
between
percent
and
percent
in
the
key
agricultural
and
industrial
states
of
mato
grosso
são
paulo
and
paraná
between
january
and
may
esalq
said
in
its
study
the
federal
government
and
a
group
representing
truck
drivers
met
for
talks
wednesday
afternoon
but
failed
to
make
any
progress
on
ending
the
protests
snarling
traffic
nationwide
the
impasse
continued
despite
petrobras
on
wednesday
lowering
diesel
prices
for
a
second
time
this
week
