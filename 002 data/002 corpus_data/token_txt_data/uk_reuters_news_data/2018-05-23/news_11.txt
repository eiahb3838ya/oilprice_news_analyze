s
nuclear
energy
supply

contributes
close
to
percent
of
the

s
electric
capacity
and
is
by
far
its
largest
source
of
carbon
free

the
program
would
be
required
among
other

to
demonstrate
that
they

of
federal
or
state
assistance
nuclear
operators
have
shut
several
reactors
over
the
past
five
years
and
plan
to
close
more
as
cheap

from
shale
fields
has
depressed
power
prices
making
it
uneconomic
for
generators
to
keep
operating
some
nuclear
plants
the
new
law
makes
new
jersey
the
fourth
state
after
new
york
illinois

to
provide
a

revenue
stream

goals
other
states
with

set
to
retire
over

economic
reasons
like
pennsylvania

murphy
also
signed
legislation
requiring
percent
of
the
state
s
power
come
from
renewable
sources
by
a
plan
to
build
mw
of
offshore
wind
by
a
plan
to
implement
energy
efficiency
programs
to
reduce
electric
and
gas
usage
and
a
plan
to
achieve
mw
of
energy
storage
by
the
governor
also
signed
an
executive
order
directing
state
agencies
to
develop
an
energy
master
plan
by
june
that
provides
a
path
to
percent
clean
energy
by
these
new
laws
will
preserve
and
create
jobs
and
spur
billions
of
dollars
in
investment
in
clean
energy
and
energy
efficiency
across
the
state
ralph
izzo
chief
executive
officer
of
pseg
said
in
a
statement
but
not
everyone
is
happy
with
the
new
nuclear
subsidy
including
the
state
s
ratepayer
advocate
the
sierra
club
aarp
and
several
power
generators
that
would
benefit
if
the
nuclear
reactors
were
to
close
this
bill
package
will
mean
new
jersey
stays
hooked
on
nuclear
power
at
the
expense
of
renewables
like
solar
and
wind
it
will
essentially
block
our
efforts
to
get
to
percent
renewable
energy
and
will
lead
to
a
crash
in
our
solar
market
