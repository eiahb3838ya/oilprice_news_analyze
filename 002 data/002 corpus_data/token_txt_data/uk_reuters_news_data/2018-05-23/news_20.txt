sinopec
asia
s
largest
refiner
will
boost
crude
oil
imports
to
an
high
as
china
tries
to
reduce
its
trade
deficit
with
the
united
states
two
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
on
wednesday
the
company
s
trading
arm
unipec
has
bought
million
barrels
or
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
to
load
in
june
they
said
the
largest
volume
ever
to
be
lifted
in
a
month
by
the
company
the
government
has
encouraged
us
to
lift
more
crude
one
of
the
sources
said
sinopec
could
not
immediately
be
reached
for
comment
china
has
pledged
to
buy
more
goods
to
reduce
the
huge
trade
deficit
with
the
united
states
and
help
ease
the
threat
of
a
trade
war
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
energy
and
commodities
are
high
on
washington
s
list
of
products
for
sale
unipec
s
june
oil
purchases
would
be
worth
about
billion
at
current
prices
they
would
represent
a
notable
increase
in
china
s
imports
of
crude
which
have
averaged
about
barrels
a
day
for
the
period
ended
in
february
according
to
energy
department
data
an
arbitrage
opportunity
has
also
opened
up
after
crude
futures
recorded
the
widest
discount
in
three
years
against
brent
at
a
barrel
last
week
enabling
unipec
to
boost
imports
to
replace
more
expensive
middle
east
oil
washington
is
keen
to
sell
more
of
the
country
s
surging
oil
and
gas
production
however
energy
exports
can
grow
only
gradually
due
to
infrastructure
bottlenecks
and
only
if
oil
gas
and
other
goods
remain
attractively
priced
compared
with
global
competition
we
want
to
buy
more
but
they
might
not
be
able
to
export
more
because
of
infrastructure
constraints
in
the
gulf
coast
a
source
said
the
united
states
exported
a
record
million
bpd
of
crude
oil
in
the
week
ended
may
and
analysts
estimate
the
country
s
limit
is
somewhere
between
million
and
million
bpd
however
reaching
that
level
would
be
a
stretch
because
only
one
terminal
the
louisiana
offshore
oil
port
loop
is
equipped
to
handle
the
very
large
crude
carriers
vlccs
that
transit
many
asian
ports
the
loop
only
started
testing
vlccs
for
export
in
february
whenever
we
talk
about
these
numbers
the
issues
are
not
just
of
pure
dock
capacity
for
china
the
more
important
issue
for
them
is
the
size
of
vessel
that
you
can
load
of
all
of
the
main
regions
where
loading
is
occurring
none
can
load
a
vlcc
directly
said
sandy
fielden
director
of
research
in
commodities
and
energy
at
morningstar
also
china
prefers
a
heavier
quality
of
crude
whereas
the
bulk
of
oil
exports
is
light
crude
