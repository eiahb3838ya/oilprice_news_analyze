a
turkish
vessel
carrying
wheat
to
yemen
this
month
was
hit
by
a
rocket
or
missile
and
more
attacks
on
merchant
ships
are
likely
due
to
a
spillover
of
the
conflict
a
senior
european
naval
official
said
on
wednesday
the
turkish
flagged
ince
inebolu
bulk
carrier
was
damaged
by
an
explosion
on
may
some
miles
off
the
red
sea
port
of
salif
where
it
was
due
to
deliver
a
tonne
cargo
of
russian
wheat
the
assessment
at
the
moment
is
it
was
almost
certainly
yemen
based
actors
firing
a
missile
or
rocket
at
the
vessel
major
tom
mobbs
head
of
intelligence
and
security
with
the
european
union
s
counter
piracy
mission
eu
navfor
told
reuters
it
has
sharpened
the
focus
in
our
mind
with
this
saudi
arabia
the
united
arab
emirates
and
sunni
muslim
allies
have
been
fighting
in
yemen
for
three
years
against
the
houthis
a
shi
ite
group
that
controls
much
of
north
yemen
including
the
capital
sanaa
and
drove
a
government
into
exile
in
the
houthis
who
are
aligned
with
the
middle
east
s
shi
ite
power
iran
have
fired
missiles
into
saudi
arabia
the
coalition
has
carried
out
a
campaign
of
thousands
of
airstrikes
and
restricted
imports
into
yemen
worsening
what
the
united
nations
says
is
potentially
the
world
s
worst
humanitarian
crisis
mobbs
declined
to
comment
on
whether
the
attack
on
the
turkish
ship
was
carried
out
by
houthis
adding
that
is
the
natural
speculation
the
ship
s
owner
ince
shipping
group
said
in
an
emailed
statement
to
reuters
that
the
vessel
had
been
hit
by
an
unidentified
missile
while
she
was
waiting
for
coalition
forces
to
give
clearance
to
proceed
to
the
port
mobbs
said
international
merchant
shipping
was
unlikely
to
be
deliberately
targeted
clearly
the
events
show
the
risk
of
misidentification
and
collateral
damage
he
said
in
the
sidelines
of
the
launch
of
a
report
by
the
group
oceans
beyond
piracy
the
coalition
says
one
of
the
main
justifications
for
its
intervention
is
to
protect
shipping
routes
through
the
narrow
bab
waterway
which
connects
the
red
sea
with
the
gulf
of
aden
and
the
arabian
sea
through
which
nearly
million
barrels
of
oil
are
shipped
daily
to
europe
the
united
states
and
asia
plus
commercial
goods
saudi
and
emirati
state
media
said
on
wednesday
that
the
coalition
had
foiled
attacks
in
the
red
sea
by
speedboats
deployed
by
houthis
against
commercial
vessels
including
an
oil
tanker
last
month
a
saudi
oil
tanker
was
hit
off
yemen
s
main
port
city
of
hodeidah
suffering
limited
damage
in
what
coalition
forces
said
was
an
attack
by
the
houthis
the
houthis
said
they
had
targeted
a
coalition
warship
the
worsening
situation
prompted
the
international
shipping
industry
in
january
to
issue
guidance
to
mariners
of
the
multiple
threats
including
missiles
sea
mines
and
improvised
explosives
devices
the
same
set
of
circumstances
that
are
prompting
these
attacks
are
unlikely
to
go
away
certainly
in
the
near
future
so
the
attacks
will
continue
