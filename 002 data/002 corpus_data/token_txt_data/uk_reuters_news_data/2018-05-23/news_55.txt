some

off

fall
within
an

demarcated
by

the

for

controversial

to
most
of
the

last

rosneft
vietnam
bv
a
unit
of
russian
state
oil
firm
rosneft
was
concerned
its
recent
drilling
in
one
such
block
could
upset
beijing
that
prompted
vietnam
s
foreign
ministry
to
assert
the
blocks
are
entirely
under
vietnamese
sovereignty
and
jurisdiction
and
a
warning
from
beijing
to
respect
its
sovereign
rights
in
march
vietnam
halted
an
oil
drilling
project
in
the
nearby
red
emperor
block
following
pressure
from
china
the
red
emperor
incident
was
a
blow
to
vietnam
s
upstream
sector
and
the
government
s
bid
to
develop
the
offshore
oil
and
gas
resources
that
it
is
legally
entitled
to
under
the
un
convention
on
the
law
of
the
sea
according
to
analysis
by
risk
analysts
verisk
maplecroft
the
area
is
important
for
vietnam
s
economic
development
vietnam
oil
gas
group
or
petrovietnam
made
up
percent
of
vietnam
s
gdp
and
percent
of
hanoi
s
total
budget
revenue
from
vietnam
has
between
billion
and
billion
tonnes
of
crude
oil
and
gas
reserves
in
the
waters
according
to
petrovietnam
which
currently
produces
million
tonnes
of
oil
equivalent
a
year
from
the
blocks
according
to
consultancy
firm
wood
mackenzie
if
china
s
nine
dashes
were
connected
as
one
continuous
line
it
would
bisect
or
incorporate
of
vietnam
s
oil
blocks
four
of
those
blocks
are
currently
producing
with
others
at
varying
stages
of
exploration
or
development
according
to

china
s
claims
in
the
south
china
sea
overlap
the
exclusive
economic
zones
of
vietnam
the
philippines
malaysia
and
brunei
despite
fierce
diplomatic
objections
by
beijing
the
philippines
sought
a
ruling
in
against
china
in
an
arbitration
case
brought
under
the
un
s
convention
of
the
law
of
sea
the
five
international
judges
handed
manila
a
sweeping
victory
which
dismissed
china
s
claims
and
removed
any
legal
basis
for
beijing
to
create
a
network
of
linked
territorial
and
economic
seas
under
its
control
legal
experts
said
chinese
officials
who
refused
to
participate
in
the
case
dismissed
it
as
a
farce
and
have
continued
to
insist
on
jurisdiction
over
most
of
the
waterway
although
they
have
not
yet
defined
the
line
as
a
continuous
one
china
and
other
claimants
have
previously
discussed
joint
development
of
energy
projects
in
disputed
waters
but
have
been
scuppered
by
issues
over
sovereignty
last
month
the
philippines
said
it
was
looking
to
seal
a
pact
with
china
within
a
few
months
to
jointly
explore
for
oil
and
gas
in
waters
claimed
by
both
countries
but
while
china
has
been
ambiguous
about
precisely
what
it
claims
the
waters
around
vietnam
s
southeastern
oil
fields
have
long
been
a
beijing
has
often
attempted
to
thwart
activity
through
backroom
diplomatic
threats
and
at
times
pressure
at
sea
those
backroom
threats
were
particularly
acute
in
and
after
which
firm
exxonmobil
corp
refused
to
bow
to
pressure
but
british
oil
giant
bp
and
others
withdrew
from
some
blocks
china
s
reaction
to
rosneft
s
drilling
will
be
quite
a
test
of
just
how
far
beijing
is
willing
to
go
said
ian
storey
a
south
china
sea
expert
at
singapore
s
iseas
yusof
ishak
institute
this
is
a
means
for
china
to
try
to
comprehensively
trash
in
a
practical
way
the
legal
ruling
against
its
claims
by
the
arbitral
tribunal
back
in
at
the
same
time
beijing
and
moscow
had
an
understanding
that
they
don
t
challenge
each
others
core
interests
including
the
south
china
sea
he
said
both
vietnamese
and
foreign
diplomats
have
described
hanoi
s
efforts
to
lure
foreign
firms
as
part
of
a
strategy
to
counter
chinese
pressure
by
internationalising
the
south
china
sea
dispute
in
may
and
june
hanoi
lodged
formal
protests
over
the
actions
of

tensions
spiked
in
may
as
rival
coastguard
and
fishing
fleets
clashed
at
sea
in
ramming
and
blocking
actions
after
the
chinese
national
offshore
oil
corporation
cnooc
moved
a
large
deepwater
rig
to
drill
test
wells
in
exploration
blocks
off
the
vietnamese
central
coast
it
later
withdrew
amid
large
scale
protests
and
riots
in
vietnam
vietnam
s
crude
oil
production
that
year
was
million
tonnes
according
to
its
general
statistics
office
by
its
crude
oil
output
had
fallen
to
million
tonnes
a
decrease
of
percent
in
april
petrovietnam
said
maritime
tensions
with
china
will
hurt
its
offshore
exploration
and
production
activities
in
making
the
rosneft
drilling
particularly
important
it
was
partnership
with
russia
under
which
vietnam
began
exploiting
its

both

in
unlike
other

russian
oil
concerns
in
the
region
appear
to
have
been
largely
left
alone
said
southeast
asia
analyst
anton
tsvetov
of
the
independent
centre
for
strategic
research
it
was
unlikely
that
beyond
official
rhetoric
china
would
directly
pressure
either
rosneft
or
the
russian
government
over
the
latest
vietnamese
drilling
tsvetov
said
there
is
a
strong
relationship
between
china
and
russia
right
now
and
energy
issues
are
high
on
the
agenda
so
i
think
it
would
be
highly
unusual
for
the
chinese
to
cause
a
problem

such
