will
take
a
view
on
the
retail
pricing
of

to
shield

prices
of
diesel
and
petrol
in
india
have
surged
to
a
record
high
stoking
opposition
criticism
of
prime
minister
narendra
modi
s
administration
for
causing
hardship
to
ordinary
people
rising
global
crude
prices
are
largely
behind
the
surge
but
fuel
is
also
heavily
taxed
by
india
s
state
and
federal
authorities
accounting
for
about
half
the
cost
of
petrol
and
percent
of
the
diesel
price
in
delhi
petrol
costs
rupees
a
litre
and
diesel
costs

the
government
is
keen
that
instead
of
having
an
ad
hoc
measure
it
may
be
desirable
to
have
a
view
which
addresses
not
only
the
volatility
but
also
takes
care
of
the
unnecessary
ambiguity
arising

india
is
particularly
at
risk
from
stronger
global

for

it
is
the

said
the

should
review

to
provide
relief
to
the

the
long
term
solution
is
to
bring
all
