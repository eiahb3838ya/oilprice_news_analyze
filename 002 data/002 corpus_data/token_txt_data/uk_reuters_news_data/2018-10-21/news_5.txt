us's mnuchin says it will be harder for iran oil importers to get waivers
jerusalem
reuters
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
on
sunday
it
will
be
harder
for
countries
to
get
waivers
on
iran
oil
sanctions
than
during
the
obama
administration
and
dismissed
concerns
that
oil
prices
could
rise
saying
the
market
had
already
factored
in
the
losses
in
an
interview
with
reuters
in
jerusalem
at
the
start
of
a
middle
east
trip
mnuchin
said
countries
would
have
to
reduce
their
purchases
of
iranian
oil
by
more
than
the
roughly
percent
level
they
did
from
to
to
get
waivers
i
would
expect
that
if
we
do
give
waivers
it
will
be
significantly
larger
reductions
said
mnuchin
he
added
oil
prices
have
already
gone
up
so
my
expectation
is
that
the
oil
market
has
anticipated
what
s
going
on
in
the
reductions
i
believe
the
information
is
already
reflected
in
the
price
of
oil
he
said
his
comments
come
two
weeks
before
the
trump
administration
reimposes
oil
and
financial
sanctions
against
iran
after
president
donald
trump
withdrew
from
a
deal
between
iran
and
six
world
powers
which
aimed
to
prevent
tehran
from
developing
nuclear
weapons
iran
s
oil
exports
could
fall
by
as
much
as
due
to
the
sanctions
straining
oil
markets
mnuchin
was
adamant
that
countries
would
eventually
have
to
cut
imports
to
nil
i
don
t
expect
we
will
get
to
zero
in
november
but
i
do
expect
we
will
eventually
get
to
zero
he
said
adding
there
have
been
already
very
significant
reductions
in
advance
of
this
his
comments
come
as
the
administration
actively
considers
waivers
on
sanctions
it
will
reimpose
for
countries
that
are
reducing
their
imports
of
iranian
oil
the
administration
withdrew
from
a
deal
over
tehran
s
nuclear
program
in
may
and
is
unilaterally
reimposing
sanctions
on
iran
s
crude
oil
consumers
after
the
sanctions
aim
to
force
tehran
to
stop
its
involvement
in
regional
conflicts
in
syria
yemen
and
iraq
and
halt
its
ballistic
missile
program
iran
says
it
has
abided
by
the
nuclear
deal
which
was
struck
with
five
other
world
powers
besides
the
united
states
while
iran
believes
that
it
can
ward
off
severe
economic
damages
from
the
sanctions
for
the
remainder
of
trump
s
term
mnuchin
predicted
a
significant
impact
on
its
economy
as
major
companies
exit
the
iranian
market
for
fear
of
reprisals
we
have
already
begun
to
see
the
impact
and
my
expectation
is
we
will
see
a
significantly
larger
impact
once
the
sanctions
go
into
place
he
said
the
economic
squeeze
will
be
very
big
over
the
next
two
mnuchin
said
the
treasury
was
in
negotiations
with
financial
messaging
service
swift
that
facilitates
the
bulk
of
the
world
s
money
transactions
on
disconnecting
iran
from
the
network
washington
has
been
pressuring
swift
to
cut
iran
from
the
system
as
it
did
in
before
the
nuclear
deal
although
the
united
states
does
not
hold
a
majority
on
swift
s
board
of
directors
the
trump
administration
could
impose
penalties
on
swift
unless
it
disconnects
from
iran
i
can
assure
you
our
objective
is
to
make
sure
that
sanctioned
transactions
do
not
occur
whether
it
s
through
swift
or
any
other
mechanism
he
said
our
focus
is
to
make
sure
that
the
sanctions
are
mnuchin
declined
to
give
details
of
the
talks
with
swift
executives
he
said
however
that
the
treasury
department
would
identify
as
quickly
as
possible
banks
that
would
be
allowed
to
process
transactions
for
humanitarian
funding
to
iran
we
want
to
get
to
the
right
outcome
which
is
cutting
off
transactions
he
said
declining
to
comment
on
which
banks
would
be
selected
germany
s
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
called
in
august
for
a
system
independent
of
washington
that
would
possibly
keep
the
nuclear
agreement
with
iran
alive
