german
chancellor
angela
merkel
campaigning
for
her
christian
democrats
cdu
to
retain
control
of
the
crucial
state
of
hesse
in
next
sunday
s
election
promised
legislation
to
ward
off
the
threat
of
air
pollution
leading
to
driving
bans
speaking
at
a
news
conference
on
sunday
evening
merkel
said
it
would
be
disproportionate
to
ban
dirty
diesel
cars
from
the
road
in
places
like
frankfurt
hesse
s
largest
city
where
nitrogen
emissions
limits
were
only
marginally
exceeded
following
her
allies
disastrous
showing
in
bavaria
s
regional
elections
last
week
merkel
faces
murmurs
of
dissent
within
her
party
defeat
in
the
state
to
the
resurgent
greens
could
prove
fatal
to
her
premiership
emissions
from
diesel
cars
have
pushed
nitrogen
levels
above
the
permitted
level
of
milligrams
per
cubic
metre
in
dozens
of
cities
across
germany
and
merkel
s
government
is
keen
to
avoid
widldly
unpopular
bans
on
taking
the
cars
on
the
road
driving
bans
are
disproportionate
when
it
comes
to
small
excess
pollution
levels
she
said
we
want
to
change
the
law
that
is
a
very
important
piece
of
information
for
a
city
like
the
new
legislation
would
enshrine
in
law
that
driving
bans
were
not
proportionate
in
cases
of
a
small
excess
such
as
in
frankfurt
where
nitrogen
levels
stand
at
microgrammes
since
deployment
of
cleaner
buses
and
other
measures
would
be
sufficient
to
rein
in
pollution
levels
before
striking
a
populist
note
she
placed
herself
firmly
on
the
side
of
consumers
when
it
came
to
the
cost
of
expensive
retrofitting
of
vehicles
that
might
be
needed
in
cities
where
excess
pollution
is
substantial
we
are
on
the
side
of
owners
of
diesel
cars
and
are
clear
that
they
should
suffer
no
financial
harm
she
said
we
believe
the
car
industry
bears
responsibility
because
it
has
massively
undermined
trust
in
a
series
of
scandals
involving
schemes
to
conceal
the
true
levels
of
pollutant
emissions
from
diesel
cars
has
dealt
repeated
blows
to
the
global
reputation
of
germany
s
car
industry
in
recent
years
