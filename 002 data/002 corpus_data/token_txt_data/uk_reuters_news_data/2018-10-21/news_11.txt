jerusalem
oct
reuters
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
on
sunday
it
was
premature
to
comment
on
possible
sanctions
against
saudi
arabia
for
the
death
of
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
until
an
investigation
had
been
completed
mnuchin
said
information
so
far
on
the
investigation
was
a
good
first
step
but
not
enough
as
riyadh
faced
increasing
international
pressure
over
what
happened
to
khashoggi
who
disappeared
after
he
entered
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
on
president
donald
trump
who
has
said
the
united
states
would
consider
sanctions
against
saudi
arabia
emphasized
on
saturday
that
he
was
not
satisfied
with
the
saudis
handling
of
the
case
it
would
be
premature
to
comment
on
sanctions
and
premature
to
comment
on
really
any
issues
until
we
get
further
down
the
investigation
and
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
occurred
mnuchin
told
reporters
in
jerusalem
mnuchin
confirmed
that
he
would
not
attend
a
saudi
investment
conference
on
tuesday
however
he
said
he
would
visit
riyadh
as
planned
for
talks
with
his
counterpart
on
joint
efforts
to
counter
terrorist
financing
and
plans
by
washington
to
reimpose
sanctions
against
iran
in
november
i
did
not
think
it
was
appropriate
to
go
and
speak
at
this
conference
but
we
continue
to
have
important
issues
with
saudi
and
that
is
why
i
am
going
there
mnuchin
said
the
visit
he
said
was
necessary
as
washington
prepares
to
reimpose
sanctions
against
iran
he
said
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
saudi
arabia
would
renege
on
commitments
to
make
up
for
any
shortfall
in
global
oil
supplies
as
iranian
oil
exports
are
curbed
under
the
sanctions
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
are
not
going
to
honor
those
commitments
said
mnuchin
who
will
meet
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
while
in
riyadh
