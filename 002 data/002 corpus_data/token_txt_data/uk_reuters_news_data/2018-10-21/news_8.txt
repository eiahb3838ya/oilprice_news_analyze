saudi
arabia
s
explanation
of
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
was
a
good
first
step
but
not
enough
the
treasury
secretary
said
on
sunday
adding
it
was
premature
to
discuss
sanctions
against
riyadh
over
the
incident
the
comments
from
steven
mnuchin
are
the
latest
from
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
that
appear
aimed
at
censuring
a
killing
that
has
sparked
global
outrage
while
protecting
relations
with
the
world
s
top
oil
exporter
european
governments
have
been
more
forceful
in
dismissing
riyadh
s
explanation
that
khashoggi
died
following
a
fistfight
in
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
on
on
sunday
britain
s
brexit
minister
said
the
account
was
not
credible
it
would
be
premature
to
comment
on
sanctions
and
premature
to
comment
on
really
any
issues
until
we
get
further
down
the
investigation
and
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
occurred
mnuchin
told
reporters
in
jerusalem
he
confirmed
he
would
not
attend
a
saudi
investment
conference
on
tuesday
however
he
said
he
would
visit
riyadh
as
planned
for
talks
with
his
counterpart
there
on
joint
efforts
to
counter
terrorist
financing
and
plans
by
washington
to
reimpose
sanctions
against
iran
in
november
after
denying
any
involvement
in
the
disappearance
of
khashoggi
for
two
weeks
saudi
arabia
on
saturday
said
the
journalist
and
critic
of
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
had
died
in
a
fistfight
at
the
consulate
an
hour
later
another
saudi
official
attributed
the
death
to
a
chokehold
reflecting
the
intensifying
international
scepticism
over
its
account
a
senior
saudi
government
official
has
laid
out
a
new
version
that
in
key
respects
contradicts
previous
explanations
the
latest
account
includes
details
on
how
the
team
of
saudi
nationals
sent
to
confront
khashoggi
had
threatened
him
with
being
drugged
and
kidnapped
and
then
killed
him
in
a
chokehold
when
he
resisted
a
member
of
the
team
then
dressed
in
khashoggi
s
clothes
to
make
it
appear
as
if
he
had
left
the
consulate
turkish
officials
suspect
khashoggi
a
saudi
national
and
resident
was
killed
inside
the
consulate
by
a
team
of
saudi
agents
and
his
body
cut
up
trump
s
comments
about
the
khashoggi
incident
in
recent
days
have
ranged
from
threatening
saudi
arabia
with
very
severe
consequences
and
warning
of
economic
sanctions
to
more
conciliatory
remarks
in
which
he
has
played
up
the
country
s
role
as
a
ally
against
iran
and
islamist
militants
as
well
as
a
major
purchaser
of
arms
i
am
not
satisfied
until
we
find
the
answer
but
it
was
a
big
first
step
it
was
a
good
first
step
but
i
want
to
get
to
the
answer
trump
told
reporters
this
weekend
when
asked
about
the
saudi
investigation
and
the
subsequent
firing
of
saudi
officials
over
the
incident
in
an
interview
with
the
washington
post
trump
said
that
obviously
there
s
been
deception
and
there
s
been
lies
saudi
arabia
s
account
of
the
incident
has
changed
multiple
times
the
authorities
initially
dismissed
reports
that
khashoggi
had
gone
missing
inside
the
consulate
as
false
and
said
he
had
left
the
building
soon
after
entering
when
the
media
reported
a
few
days
later
that
he
had
been
killed
there
they
called
the
accusations
baseless
britain
s
brexit
minister
dominic
raab
said
the
explanation
that
khashoggi
had
died
after
a
fistfight
was
not
believable
no
i
don
t
think
it
is
credible
he
said
in
an
interview
on
bbc
tv
for
western
allies
a
main
question
will
be
whether
they
believe
that
the
prince
who
has
painted
himself
as
a
reformer
has
any
culpability
king
salman
had
handed
the
running
of
saudi
arabia
to
him
trump
has
forged
close
ties
with
saudi
arabia
and
the
crown
prince
citing
the
kingdom
s
economic
importance
and
its
role
in
countering
the
influence
of
rival
iran
in
the
region
french
finance
minister
bruno
le
maire
said
saudi
arabia
s
admission
that
khashoggi
had
been
killed
was
welcome
progress
but
urged
the
kingdom
to
follow
through
with
a
full
and
transparent
investigation
i
note
that
the
saudi
authorities
have
changed
tack
admitted
the
facts
and
accepted
some
responsibility
so
we
re
making
progress
le
maire
said
on
france
television
but
full
light
needs
to
be
some
governments
and
prominent
executives
have
said
they
would
pull
out
of
an
upcoming
investment
conference
in
saudi
arabia
among
the
latest
the
government
of
new
zealand
said
it
would
not
attend
as
did
the
head
of
the
main
banking
unit
of
japanese
financial
group
mufg
according
to
the
senior
saudi
official
the
saudi
team
rolled
up
khashoggi
s
body
in
a
rug
took
it
out
in
a
consular
vehicle
and
handed
it
to
a
local
cooperator
for
disposal
one
of
the
operatives
then
donned
khashoggi
s
clothes
eyeglasses
and
apple
watch
and
left
through
the
back
door
of
the
consulate
to
make
it
look
like
khashoggi
had
walked
out
of
the
building
the
senior
saudi
official
said
turkish
investigators
are
likely
to
find
out
what
happened
to
the
corpse
before
long
a
senior
turkish
official
said
on
saturday
officials
told
reuters
in
turkey
on
thursday
that
khashoggi
s
remains
may
have
been
dumped
in
belgrad
forest
adjacent
to
istanbul
and
at
a
rural
location
near
the
city
of
yalova
km
miles
south
of
istanbul
turkish
sources
say
the
authorities
have
an
audio
recording
purportedly
documenting
khashoggi
s
murder
inside
the
consulate
turkish
newspaper
yeni
safak
citing
the
audio
said
his
torturers
cut
off
his
fingers
during
an
interrogation
and
later
beheaded
him
trump
said
no
one
from
his
administration
had
seen
video
or
a
transcript
of
what
happened
inside
the
consulate
