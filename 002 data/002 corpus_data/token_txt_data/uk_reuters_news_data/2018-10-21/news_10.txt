reuters
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
on
sunday
it
was
premature
to
comment
on
possible
sanctions
against
saudi
arabia
for
the
death
of
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
until
an
investigation
into
what
happened
had
been
completed
mnuchin
said
information
so
far
on
the
investigation
was
a
good
first
step
but
not
enough
as
riyadh
faced
international
pressure
to
disclose
what
happened
to
khashoggi
who
disappeared
after
he
entered
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
on
president
donald
trump
emphasized
on
saturday
that
he
was
not
satisfied
with
the
saudis
handling
of
the
case
further
raising
questions
over
whether
he
would
act
to
impose
sanctions
on
saudi
officials
believed
to
be
behind
khashoggi
s
death
sanctions
possibly
under
the
global
magnitsky
act
that
targets
individuals
responsible
for
gross
human
rights
abuses
would
be
a
major
step
against
a
key
ally
in
the
middle
east
and
the
world
s
no
oil
exporter
it
would
be
premature
to
comment
on
sanctions
and
premature
to
comment
on
really
any
issues
until
we
get
further
down
the
investigation
and
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
occurred
mnuchin
told
reporters
in
jerusalem
at
the
start
of
a
middle
east
visit
mnuchin
confirmed
that
he
would
not
attend
a
saudi
investment
conference
on
tuesday
however
he
said
he
would
visit
riyadh
as
planned
for
talks
with
his
counterpart
there
on
joint
efforts
towards
countering
terrorist
financing
and
curbing
iran
s
military
and
political
influence
i
did
not
think
it
was
appropriate
to
go
and
speak
at
this
conference
but
we
continue
to
have
important
issues
with
saudi
and
that
is
why
i
am
going
there
mnuchin
said
the
saudis
have
said
they
plan
to
move
forward
with
the
conference
scheduled
for
despite
a
wave
of
cancellations
by
business
government
and
media
leaders
the
riyadh
visit
he
said
was
needed
as
washington
prepares
to
reimpose
sanctions
against
iran
in
early
november
after
trump
withdrew
from
a
deal
between
tehran
and
six
world
powers
that
sought
to
prevent
iran
from
obtaining
a
nuclear
weapon
mnuchin
said
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
saudi
arabia
would
renege
on
commitments
to
make
up
for
any
shortfall
in
global
oil
supplies
as
iranian
oil
exports
are
cut
under
the
sanctions
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
are
not
going
to
honor
those
commitments
said
mnuchin
who
will
meet
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
while
in
riyadh
asked
whether
he
would
deliver
a
message
to
saudi
officials
over
the
khashoggi
case
while
in
riyadh
mnuchin
said
i
m
sure
i
will
be
speaking
to
the
president
before
i
go
there
and
if
he
has
a
message
he
wants
me
to
deliver
i
will
obviously
deliver
it
but
it
is
not
the
focus
of
my
reporting
