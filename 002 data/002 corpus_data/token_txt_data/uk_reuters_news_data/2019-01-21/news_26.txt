lithuania
s
klaipeda
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
import
terminal
will
more
than
double
its
lng
volumes
once
gas
pipelines
to
poland
and
finland
open
after
turning
the
baltic
port
into
a
regional
supply
hub
its
operator
said
in
an
interview
the
import
facility
named
independence
was
built
in
klaipeda
port
in
to
break
the
monopoly
of
russia
s
gazprom
over
gas
supplies
to
lithuania
latvia
and
estonia
baltic
countries
formerly
ruled
from
moscow
it
has
chiefly
imported
norwegian
lng
for
mostly
domestic
consumption
using
between
a
fifth
and
a
third
of
its
annual
capacity
of
million
tonnes
of
lng
but
began
to
diversify
in
late
with
the
import
of
its
first
cargo
we
certainly
see
an
interest
from
international
trading
houses
to
use
this
infrastructure
the
terminal
and
the
upcoming
pipelines
to
access
gas
markets
in
central
and
eastern
europe
klaipedos
nafta
ceo
mindaugas
jusius
told
reuters
on
friday
we
keep
getting
queries
whether
we
have
capacities
available
for
this
the
nearest
lng
terminal
to
ours
in
poland
is
fully
booked
until
he
said
adding
our
ambition
is
to
achieve
terminal
utilization
of
to
poland
s
swinoujscie
lng
terminal
miles
km
west
along
the
baltic
coast
is
due
to
expand
capacity
to
million
tonnes
per
annum
by
hoping
to
capitalise
on
higher
gas
demand
in
central
europe
and
lessen
the
region
s
dependence
on
russian
gas
between
the
two
ports
lies
the
russian
enclave
of
kaliningrad
which
just
this
month
opened
its
own
lng
import
terminal
for
domestic
needs
the
gipl
pipeline
to
poland
is
due
to
open
in
and
with
it
the
prospect
that
lithuania
supplies
ukraine
said
jusius
this
would
bolster
ukraine
s
diversification
of
its
own
supplies
from
russia
disputes
with
whom
have
led
to
major
supply
disruptions
to
the
rest
of
europe
klaipedos
nafta
is
also
participating
in
the
development
of
four
lng
import
terminals
in
europe
and
central
and
southern
america
with
a
view
to
becoming
a
shareholder
and
operator
jusius
said
one
of
the
projects
could
reach
final
investment
decision
fid
this
year
and
another
by
said
jusius
declining
to
name
the
projects
citing
confidentiality
agreements
our
ambition
is
to
grow
into
the
largest
operator
of
lng
import
terminals
worldwide
said
jusius
lithuania
decided
last
year
to
continue
lng
imports
until
at
least
jusius
said
klaipedos
nafta
will
decide
by
late
whether
to
buy
a
floating
storage
and
regasification
unit
