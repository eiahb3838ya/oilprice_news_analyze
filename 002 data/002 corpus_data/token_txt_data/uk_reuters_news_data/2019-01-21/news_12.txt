for
officials
in
regions
that
miss
air
quality

this
winter
refusing
to
accept
unfavorable
weather
or
mounting
economic
pressure
as
excuses
an
environment
ministry
official
said
on
monday
china
is
in
the
fifth
year
of
a
war
on
pollution
to
reverse
the
environmental
damage
of
four
decades
of
breakneck
economic
growth
and
last
year
cut
concentrations
of
hazardous
particles
known
as
by
an
average
of
percent
in
cities
but
in
the
key
northern
control
area
of
the
concentration
of
such
particles
rose
to
an
average
of
micrograms
per
cubic
meter
in
the
last
three
months
of
the
year
more
than
double
the
official
standard
that
prompted
fresh
fears
that
local
governments
were
turning
a
blind
eye
to
polluters
henan
province
home
to
the
worst
performing
cities
in
the
last
quarter
of
blamed
unfavorable
weather
conditions
for
the
rise
there
is
no
way
for
local
officials
to
evade
punishment
by
using
weather
conditions
as
an
excuse
said
liu
bingjiang
head
of
the
atmospheric
environment
department
of
china
s
environment
ministry
similarly
the
economic
situation
can
not
be
used
as
an
excuse
he
told
a
regular
briefing
for
those
who
failed
to
meet
the
targets
we
will
hold
them
accountable
publicly
and
local
governments
will
need
to
come
out
with
detailed
punishment
the
ministry
has
repeatedly
warned
that
china
s
economic
slowdown
brought
fresh
challenges
in
the
effort
to
curb
smog
economic
growth
fell
to
percent
in
the
lowest
in
years
the
statistics
bureau
has
said
but
while
china
will
try
to
take
a
more
nuanced
approach
to
pollution
aiming
to
make
companies
feel
at
ease
liu
said
it
would
show
no
leniency
in
punishing
offenders
china
will
impose
even
tougher
emission
standards
at
steel

this
year
and
has
also
pledged
more
action

in
the
north
ministry
officials
said
weather
which
accounted
for
about
a
third
of
air
quality
improvements
in
had
already
been
factored
into
assessments
of
local
officials
performance
china
has
long
used
a
tactic
of
naming
and
shaming
city
governments
forcing
mayors
to
make
public
apologies
and
firing
local
bureaucrats
to
ensure
pollution
is
tackled
we
have
to
win
the
war
against
air
pollution
no
matter
what
happens
said
liu
there
is
no
leeway
for
us
and
we
