nigerian
president
muhammadu
buhari
s
government
accused
the
main
opposition
party
of
planning
violence
ahead
of
next
month
s
election
in
a
nation
with
a
history
of
unrest
and
fraud
allegations
around
votes
the

called
it
a
ludicrous
pretext
for
repression
the

ruler
in
the
who

voted
into
office

atiku
abubakar
a
businessman
and
former
vice
president
reliable
polls
are
hard
to
find
in
the
nation
of
million
people
and
analysts
widely
expect
a
tight
race
partly
because
opposition
stronghold
states
have
seen
a
bigger
increase
in
voter
registration
than
ones
where
the
ruling
party
is
popular
we
have
credible
intelligence
that
armed
bandits
andboko
haram
insurgents
have
been
mobilised
to
engage
in
massive
attacks
and
other
acts
of
violence

at
abubakar

democratic
party
pdp
mohammed
who
did
not
provide
details
of
evidence
said
the
opposition
wanted
to
create
a
constitutional
crisis
and
trigger
an
interim
government
because
it
could
not
win
the
election
it
is
imperative
to
state
that
the
pdp
finds
the
claims
of
alhaji
lai
mohammed
irresponsible
and
ludicrous
it
is
just
a
measure
for
building
the
ground
for
framing
up
and
arrest
of
leading
members
said
the
pdp
in
an
emailed
statement
in
october
buhari
sought
to
reassure
voters
the
election
would
be
free
and
fair
after
the
opposition
and
international
observers
raised
concerns
that
a
gubernatorial
vote
was
marred
by
voter
intimidation
security
has
become
a
campaign
issue
due
to
an
uptick
in
attacks
by
islamist
insurgents
in
the
northeast
islamic
state
in
west
africa
iswa

boko
haram
the
militant
group
from
which
it
broke
away
in
have
both
carried
out
attacks
in
the
last
few
months
the
pdp
in
its
statement
also
urged
the
independent
electoral
commission
inec
to
ensure
a
free
election
the
entire
nation
is
worried
and
the
palpable
fear
of
every
nigerian
today
is
whether
inec
chairman
mahmood
yakubu
can
conduct
an
election
which
will
indeed
be
free
fair
credible
and
transparent
it
