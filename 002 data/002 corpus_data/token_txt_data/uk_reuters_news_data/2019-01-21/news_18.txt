oil
exports
from
southern
iraq
are
holding
close
to
a
record
high
so
far
in
according
to
shipping
data
and
an
industry
source
which
could
raise
questions
over
whether
opec
s
producer
is
following
through
on
a
deal
to
cut
output
southern
iraqi
exports
in
the
first
days
of
january
averaged
close
to
million
barrels
per
day
according
to
tanker
data
on
refinitiv
eikon
and
separate
tracking
by
an
industry
source
that
s
close
to
december
s
million
bpd
a
monthly
record
the
figures
suggest
there
is
little
sign
yet
of
lower
supplies
from
iraq
despite
a
deal
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
allies
to
reduce
output
by
million
bpd
as
of
to
support
the
market
so
far
no
cuts
the
industry
source
said
on
monday
of
iraq
s
export
rate
the
south
is
the
main
outlet
for
iraq
s
crude
an
iraqi
official
the
director
of
iraq
s
basra
oil
company
on
gave
similar
figures
for
january
exports
to
those
suggested
by
the
tanker
data
and
source
iraq
which
has
been
expanding
its
oil
export
capacity
was
reluctant
to
join
a
previous
supply
cut
effort
which
began
in
and
was
at
times
opec
s
least
compliant
member
with
the
initiative
to
be
sure
the
deal
applies
to
production
not
exports
it
is
possible
that
iraq
could
have
cut
production
and
maintained
exports
from
crude
held
in
storage
or
reduced
supply
to
domestic
refineries
nonetheless
oil
traders
and
analysts
will
be
looking
at
exports
to
gauge
whether
the
deal
is
lowering
supply
to
the
global
market
so
far
iraq
s
shipments
abroad
from
the
north
haven
t
declined
significantly
either
iraq
s
northern
exports
appear
to
have
held
steady
in
january
at
about
bpd
according
to
tanker
data
compiled
by
reuters
and
the
industry
source
that
is
still
far
below
levels
of
more
than
bpd
in
some
months
of
baghdad
says
it
will
stick
to
the
accord
oil
minister
thamer
ghadhban
said
on
iraq
would
keep
production
at
the
level
of
its
opec
target
in
the
first
half
of
under
the
deal
iraq
agreed
to
cut
production
by
bpd
to
million
