asian
markets
kept
their
nerve
on
monday
as
data
showed
the
chinese
economy
slowed
at
the
end
of
last
year
underlining
the
urgent
need
for
more
stimulus
as

the

s
economy
grew
percent
in
the

quarter
from
a
year
earlier
as
had
been
expected

matching
levels
last
seen
in
early

the
global
financial
crisis

there
were
some
bright

with
industrial
output
rising
a
surprisingly
strong
percent
while
retail
sales
rose

to
be
weighing
up
the
medium
term
risks
of
further
debt
growth
against
short
term
trends
hence
the
relatively
modest
stimulatory
policy
thus
far

senior
economist
at

they
may
be
data
dependent
