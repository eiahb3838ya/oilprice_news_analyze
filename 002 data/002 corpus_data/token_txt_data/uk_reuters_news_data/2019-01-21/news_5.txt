after
an
discussion
in
brussels
on

yielded
no

with
kiev
over
breakaway
regions
in
ukraine
s
east
and
the
european
union
reliant
on
russian
gas
to
fuel
its
industries
the
future
of
gas
transit
seen
by
kiev
as
a
crucial
guarantor
of
its
independence
from
moscow
is
the
subject
of
intricate
diplomacy
russian
president
vladimir
putin
has
said
moscow
is
ready
to
keep
its
transit
of
gas
to
europe
through
ukraine
once
the
current
deal
with
kiev
expires
on
if
supplies
are
economically
viable
ukrainian
state
energy
company
naftogaz
accused
russia
of
delaying
negotiations
in
order
to
get
its

pipeline
built
first
russia
s
planned
doubling
of
capacity
on
the
nord
stream
pipeline
across
the
baltic
sea
to
germany
could
help
moscow
bypass
exports
via
ukraine

would
deny

transit
fees
gazprom
is
delaying
real
talks
in
terms
of
transit
in

to
build

stream
naftogaz
deputy
chief
executive
yuriy
vitrenko
told

before

they
will
say
we
are
ok
without
any
ukrainian

at
all
russian
gas
giant
gazprom

partners
in
the

uniper

talks
sources
familiar
with
monday
s
talks
said
european
commission
maros
sefcovic
who
chaired
the
meeting
with
ukrainian
foreign
minister
pavlo
klimkin
and
novak
had
floated
a
proposal
for
the
two
countries
to
agree
a
new
transit
contract
with
a
guaranteed
minimum
yearly
transit
volume
of
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
and
bcm
of
additional
flexibility
there
was
no
immediate
reaction
from
either
the
russian
or
ukraine
delegations
executives
from
naftogaz
and
gazprom
also
attended
the
meeting
moscow
and
kiev
have
clashed
frequently
over
energy
talks
are
complicated
by
a
lengthy
legal
dispute
between
gazprom
and
naftogaz
that
led
to
a
stockholm
arbitration
court
ruling
in
february
that
each
company
must
compensate
the
other
sefcovic
said
the
stockholm
arbitration
was
the
elephant
in
the
room
naftogaz
emerged
the
net
winner
of
that
ruling
gaining
billion
from
gazprom
gazprom
is
challenging
the
decision
a
process
that
could
take
years
for
the
russians
it
is
a
huge
stumbling
block
sefcovic
said
for
them
it
is
difficult
to
negotiate
a
good
contract
for
the
long
term
when
they
are
still
fighting
