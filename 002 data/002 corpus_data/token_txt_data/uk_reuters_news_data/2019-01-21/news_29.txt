china
national
offshore
oil
corp
cnooc
has
resold
a
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
cargo
floating
offshore
south
korea
according
to
data
from
refinitiv
eikon
and
three
industry
sources
highlighting
the
drop
in
winter
gas
demand
in
china
the
move
is
a
departure
from
the
winter
when
china
was
desperate
to
procure
lng
to
meet
demand
for
the
fuel
amid
a
spike
in
natural
gas
consumption
following
a
switch
from
coal
to
gas
for
residential
heating
and
industrial
processes
in
cnooc
spent
million
to
lease
two
lng
tankers
including
one
called
the
neo
energy
as
an
emergency
stash
of
the
fuel
for
unloading
at
the
company
s
receiving
terminals
at
tianjin
in
northern
china
and
ningbo
on
the
east
coast
now
cnooc
has
sold
a
cargo
on
the
neo
energy
which
was
loaded
onto
the
ship
on
from
the
bontang
liquefaction
plant
in
indonesia
one
of
the
sources
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
move
said
on
monday
on
sunday
cnooc
redirected
the
neo
energy
to
tokyo
from
the
okpo
anchorage
in
south
korea
the
eikon
data
showed
the
vessel
currently
fully
laden
can
hold
about
cubic
metres
of
lng
details
of
the
buyer
were
not
immediately
clear
the
whole
idea
of
leasing
neo
energy
was
to
cope
with
spikes
in
winter
demand
but
now
it
seems
there
is
less
such
need
the
source
added
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
as
he
is
not
authorised
to
speak
with
the
media
cnooc
could
not
immediately
be
reached
for
comment
last
winter
s
gas
shortages
prompted
chinese
companies
this
winter
to
secure
supply
ahead
of
time
and
pushed
lng
imports
to
a
record
monthly
high
in
december
but
temperatures
have
been
higher
than
normal
this
winter
and
weather
data
from
refinitiv
eikon
forecasts
temperatures
ahead
leaving
suppliers
with
high
inventories
chinese
buyers
do
not
typically
resell
lng
cargoes
during
winter
highlighting
the
country
s
reduced
appetite
for
the
fuel
said
a
second
source
who
is
involved
in
lng
shipping
companies
were
under
pressure
to
remove
the
surplus
lng
cargoes
because
of
the
supply
and
demand
imbalance
this
winter
likely
resulting
in
losses
from
the
sales
because
of
flat
domestic
gas
prices
said
the
first
source
an
lng
distributor
based
in
the
northern
chinese
city
of
tangshan
the
country
s
biggest
steel
producing
city
said
monday
that
industrial
lng
demand
has
been
flat
this
winter
as
users
such
as
steel
mills
have
curbed
output
to
meet
air
pollution
reduction
targets
lng
prices
for
the
tangshan
region
are
at
yuan
to
yuan
per
tonne
little
changed
from
the
start
of
the
heating
season
in
november
