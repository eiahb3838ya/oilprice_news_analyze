china
s
december
coal
output
climbed
percent
from
the
year
before
government
data
showed
hitting
the
highest
level
in
over
three
years
as
major
miners
ramped
up
production
amid
robust
winter
demand
and
after
the
country
started
up
new
mines
miners
produced
million
tonnes
of
coal
in
december
according
to
data
released
on
monday
by
the
national
bureau
of
statistics
that
is
the
largest
volume
since
june
china
approved
more
than
billion
yuan
s
billion
worth
of
new
coal
mining
projects
last
year
much
more
than
official
documents
show
that
came
after
the
country
closed
old
and
coal
mines
as
part
of
its
battle
to
clean
up
the
environment
coal
mining
capacity
coming
online
will
lead
to
another
increase
in
output
this
year
after
boosting
december
output
to
a
more
than
high
said
a
coal
analyst
with
a
major
broker
he
declined
to
be
identified
as
he
was
not
authorised
by
his
company
to
speak
to
media
on
the
matter
the
new
projects
stoked
overall
coal
output
last
year
with
annual
production
rising
percent
to
the
highest
since
at
billion
tonnes
however
some
miners
and
traders
expect
supplies
to
fall
sharply
in
january
following
a
crackdown
on
coal
mines
after
a
major
accident
on
in
the
northwestern
province
of
shaanxi
potentially
dragging
on
output
through
the
year
it
is
now
possible
that
shaanxi
will
implement
the
regulations
on
illegal
production
which
would
significantly
reduce
output
in
the
province
for
the
year
zhai
yu
senior
consultant
at
analysts
wood
mackenzie
said
in
a
note
published
last
week
if
stricter
checks
are
extended
to
other
provinces
domestic
supply
could
tighten
from
its
currently
relaxed
situation
helping
coal
imports
as
a
result
zhai
wrote
shaanxi
accounts
for
about
percent
of
china
s
annual
coal
production
