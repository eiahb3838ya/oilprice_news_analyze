the

s
oil
and
gas
sector
had
been
dormant
in
recent
years
in

new
projects

the
ongoing
discussions
over

tenders

awarding

expects
to
start
producing
oil
in
pouyanne
said
he
recently
told
ugandan
president
yoweri
museveni
that
total
would
also
be
willing
to
take
a
stake
in
a
refinery
to
process
crude
from
the
field
which
is
due
to
be
built
and
operational
by
