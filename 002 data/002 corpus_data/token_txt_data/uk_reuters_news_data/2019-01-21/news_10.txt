mexico
s
new
government
knew
a
pipeline
was
leaking
but
did
not
act
for
hours
before
a
blast
killed
at
least
people
a
minister
said
on
sunday
increasing
scrutiny
of
a
push
to
stop
fuel
theft
seen
as
the
president
s
first
crackdown
on
crime
state
oil
firm
pemex
did
not
close
the
gasoline
pipe
when
first
notified
by
the
military
about
four
hours
before
friday
s
blast
because
it
considered
the
leak
minimal
security
minister
alfonso
durazo
told
a
news
conference
in
the
hours
that
followed
the
leak
grew
and
as
many
as
people
brought
plastic
containers
to
the
gushing
duct
filling
up
with
free
fuel
in
what
witnesses
described
as
an
almost
festive
atmosphere
relatives
of
some
of
the
victims
said
fuel
shortages
stemming
from
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
s
plan
attracted
people
to
the
leak
at
the
pipeline
a
few
miles
from
a
major
refinery
in
december
lopez
obrador
sent
soldiers
to
refineries
to
help
fight
organised
crime
and
fuel
theft
while
shutting
down
pipelines
tapped
by
thieves
the
measures
have
reduced
theft
but
in
early
january
also
led
to
shortages
and
lines
at
gas
stations
stretching
for
miles
soon
after
dark
on
friday
in
the
tlahuelilpan
district
of
the
central
hidalgo
state
gasoline
and
fumes
ignited
in
a
fireball
that
killed
at
least
people
and
left
a
black
scar
on
the
land
dozens
were
so
badly
charred
they
will
only
be
identified
through
dna
testing
officials
said
critics
say
the
government
did
too
little
to
prevent
people
from
gathering
at
the
scene
before
the
explosion
was
too
hasty
in
sending
gasoline
through
the
duct
after
weeks
of
it
being
closed
due
to
the
fuel
theft
crackdown
and
acted
too
slowly
once
the
leak
was
detected
half
a
dozen
people
told
reuters
their
relatives
went
to
the
leaking
duct
because
they
had
been
struggling
to
find
fuel
and
were
desperate
to
fill
up
cars
to
get
to
work
or
run
their
farms
a
lot
of
innocent
people
came
here
perhaps
their
car
didn
t
have
enough
gasoline
for
tomorrow
and
they
said
i
m
just
going
to
go
for
a
few
litres
said
farmer
isidoro
velasco
who
said
his
nephew
mario
hidalgo
was
probably
killed
pemex
had
been
in
a
rush
to
reopen
the
pipeline
to
avoid
a
new
round
of
gasoline
shortages
in
mexico
city
said
gonzalo
monroy
the
head
of
energy
consulting
firm
gmec
citing
conversations
with
oil
industry
professionals
disputing
accounts
that
fuel
thieves
opened
up
the
pipe
he
said
sources
in
pemex
indicated
the
fissure
occurred
at
a
spot
pemex
had
previously
repaired
and
gave
way
under
the
pressure
of
a
new
surge
of
fuel
pemex
officials
decided
to
keep
fuel
running
after
the
first
signs
of
a
leak
and
send
a
team
to
inspect
it
he
said
pemex
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
when
questioned
about
why
it
took
so
long
to
close
the
pipe
s
valves
after
the
leak
was
detected
durazo
said
pemex
followed
protocol
the
explosion
occurred
half
an
hour
after
pemex
closed
the
valve
he
said
because
gasoline
remained
in
the
pipe
lopez
obrador
said
on
sunday
that
the
disaster
had
not
weakened
his
resolve
to
fight
fuel
theft
i
won
t
take
a
single
step
backwards
he
said
at
the
first
of
two
news
conferences
i
can
only
offer
people
apologies
if
this
action
causes
sacrifices
harm
and
lopez
obrador
said
he
hoped
supply
would
normalise
soon
as
mexico
buys
more
tanker
trucks
for
distribution
by
road
if
successful
in
uprooting
a
parallel
fuel
network
that
siphons
off
about
billion
worth
of
fuel
from
pemex
each
year
the
veteran
leftist
who
won
last
year
s
election
on
promises
to
root
out
endemic
corruption
will
have
scored
a
big
early
victory
strengthening
ailing
national
oil
company
pemex
and
helping
stabilise
fuel
prices
the
blast
however
has
raised
the
stakes
failure
would
likely
not
only
erode
his
popularity
but
pose
risks
for
the
economy
the
world
s
fuel
market
an
opinion
poll
last
week
showed
the
fuel
strategy
was
a
polarizing
issue
with
about
half
the
population
supporting
the
measure
despite
the
lines
at
gas
stations
and
other
difficulties
pemex
initially
took
the
pipeline
out
of
service
in
late
december
as
the
government
tried
to
protect
it
from
gangs
who
had
hit
it
times
in
tlahuelilpan
pemex
chief
executive
officer
octavio
romero
said
on
saturday
after
pemex
began
attempting
to
restart
operations
on
wednesday
the
line
experienced
four
more
attacks
romero
said
pemex
closed
a
valve
at
the
pipeline
on
friday
after
noting
a
drop
in
pressure
from
the
leak
pemex
informed
other
authorities
of
the
leak
at
he
added
responding
to
questions
about
why
fuel
kept
flowing
from
the
leak
up
until
the
explosion
lopez
obrador
said
that
barrels
of
gasoline
were
accumulated
in
the
pipeline
between
the
tula
refinery
and
the
village
energy
minister
rocio
nahle
said
the
pipeline
was
pressurized
lopez
obrador
said
the
army
which
deployed
just
soldiers
before
the
explosion
gave
orders
for
villagers
to
stay
back
but
were
ignored
