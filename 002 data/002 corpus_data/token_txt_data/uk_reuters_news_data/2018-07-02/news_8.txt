china carbon emissions in retreat after 'structural break' in economy - study
shanghai
reuters
china
s
carbon
dioxide
emissions
fell
from
to
and
might
already
have
peaked
according
to
a
study
published
on
monday
with
structural
economic
changes
allowing
beijing
to
meet
targets
earlier
than
expected
china
vowed
before
the
paris
climate
talks
in
to
bring
emissions
to
a
peak
by
around
and
the
country
s
top
climate
official
xie
zhenhua
has
already
said
it
could
meet
the
pledge
ahead
of
time
but
the
study
published
by
nature
geoscience
said
in
retrospect
the
commitment
may
have
been
fulfilled
even
as
it
was
being
made
with
emissions
hitting
a
record
gigatonnes
in
and
declining
in
the
following
three
years
dropping
to
gigatonnes
in
while
emissions
rose
by
an
average
of
percent
per
year
from
to
china
s
economy
underwent
a
structural
break
in
and
is
shifting
to
less
high
technology
sectors
it
said
unless
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
change
a
large
government
intervention
like
the
stimulus
package
of
then
china
s
emissions
will
stabilize
and
gradually
go
down
said
dabo
guan
a
professor
of
climate
change
economics
at
the
university
of
east
anglia
uea
one
of
the
authors
of
the
study
in
may
environment
group
greenpeace
estimated
that
china
s
emissions
rose
percent
in
the
first
quarter
of
after
increasing
percent
last
year
adding
that
backsliding
on
earlier
progress
could
result
in
china
s
biggest
annual
rise
in
emissions
since
this
year
i
would
have
genuinely
wanted
it
to
have
peaked
in
but
given
the
increase
in
and
first
few
months
in
i
am
cautious
said
chan
head
of
the
climate
change
department
at
hsbc
adding
that
coal
consumption
remained
a
major
component
of
china
s
energy
mix
but
the
uea
s
guan
said
calculations
for
are
incomplete
and
fail
to
take
into
account
rising
coal
quality
efficiency
improvements
or
land
use
changes
that
could
have
taken
more
out
of
the
system
an
early
chinese
peak
in
emissions
would
bolster
arguments
that
the
paris
agreement
is
too
lenient
on
the
country
an
argument
made
by
president
donald
trump
when
he
vowed
to
withdraw
from
the
deal
last
year
guan
said
it
is
clear
the
original
target
of
around
was
conservative
but
the
ultimate
issue
was
not
when
china
peaked
but
at
what
level
even
if
we
peak
in
and
if
it
reaches
gigatonnes
it
would
also
be
a
disaster
