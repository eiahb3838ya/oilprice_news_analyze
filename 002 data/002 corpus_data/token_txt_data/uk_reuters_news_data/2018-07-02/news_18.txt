a
renewed
slump
in
chinese
shares
and
a
sobering
set
of
global
factory
surveys
sucked
world
markets
lower
on
monday
while
the
euro
and
mexican
peso
were
both
jolted
by
political
developments
it
was
the
first
trading
day
of
the
new
month
quarter
and
but
there
was
no
let
up
for
bruised
investors
after
the
worst
start
to
a
year
for
world
shares
since
shanghai
s
bear
market
lurch
had
continued
overnight
with
losses
of
up
to
percent
as
firms
await
some
billion
of
tariffs
this
week
and
new
business
surveys
showed
some
worrying
signs
of
deterioration
europe
suffered
a
thud
too
with
the
stoxx
share
index
dropping
as
much
as
percent
and
the
euro
down
percent
to
as
differences
over
immigration
threatened
angela
merkel
s
german
coalition
government
the
trade
strains
meanwhile
were
compounded
by
an
eu
threat
to
hit
the
united
states
with
almost
billion
in
retaliatory
tariffs
lingering
concerns
over
president
donald
trump
s
dislike
for
the
world
trade
organization
and
by
data
showing
the
weakest
euro
zone
manufacturing
sector
growth
in
months
there
are
a
lot
of
uncertainties
out
there
said
rabobank
s
head
of
macro
strategy
elwin
de
groot
it
is
pretty
unclear
what
is
going
to
happen
in
germany
and
the
trade
concerns
are
really
top
of
mind
at
the
moment
so
we
are
seeing
quite
a
lot
of
weakness
in
emerging
all
the
concerns
meant
more
demand
for
bonds
treasuries
and
german
bund
both
saw
buying
whereas
wall
street
looked
set
to
go
lower
when
it
reopens
shanghai
blue
chips
had
resumed
their
slide
overnight
with
a
fall
of
percent
that
alongside
another
flop
by
the
yuan
hot
on
the
heels
of
its
weakest
month
on
record
soured
sentiment
across
asia
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
fell
percent
adding
to
a
percent
drop
last
week
japan
s
nikkei
shed
percent
to
an
low
with
a
survey
of
manufacturers
showing
sentiment
there
had
also
darkened
a
shade
in
the
face
of
trade
war
threats
tension
is
growing
ahead
of
a
july
deadline
when
washington
is
due
to
impose
us
billion
of
tariffs
on
chinese
exports
a
new
report
from
oxford
economics
warned
that
tariff
threats
if
realised
would
extend
high
tariffs
to
over
percent
of
world
imports
a
more
than
tenfold
rise
versus
the
percent
of
imports
hit
by
the
new
tariffs
imposed
so
far
the
threat
to
world
growth
is
significant
it
said
in
a
scenario
of
escalating
tariffs
our
modelling
suggests
world
gdp
could
be
cut
by
up
to
percentage
points
in
two
surveys
of
chinese
manufacturing
out
in
the
last
few
days
showed
a
softening
in
activity
partly
due
to
softness
in
exports
a
slew
of
factory
readings
are
due
on
monday
while
the
ism
report
is
out
on
tuesday
minutes
of
the
last
federal
reserve
policy
meeting
come
on
thursday
and
the
week
closes
with
payrolls
for
june
in
currency
markets
the
euro
was
knocked
back
on
reports
german
interior
minister
horst
seehofer
had
rejected
a
migration
deal
merkel
negotiated
at
an
eu
summit
on
friday
the
currency
then
partly
bounced
on
news
seehofer
had
offered
to
step
down
as
minister
and
as
chair
of
his
christian
social
union
csu
party
only
to
slide
back
again
after
the
euro
zone
manufacturing
data
came
in
weak
seehofer
s
move
makes
the
future
of
merkel
s
government
even
more
uncertain
her
christian
democrats
cdu
rely
on
the
csu
to
maintain
power
through
a
coalition
formed
three
months
ago
to
end
a
political
vacuum
the
euro
was
percent
lower
at
having
skidded
as
far
as
at
one
stage
the
dollar
gained
percent
on
a
basket
of
currencies
to
but
was
still
below
friday
s
top
of
it
was
flat
on
the
yen
at
having
been
as
high
as
at
one
stage
the
mexican
peso
after
leftist
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
won
a
decisive
victory
for
president
dealers
said
the
clear
win
might
settle
one
source
of
political
uncertainty
but
obrador
was
also
expected
to
sharpen
mexican
divisions
with
trump
after
an
initial
retreat
the
dollar
soon
rebounded
to
top
pesos
up
from
last
week
s
trough
around
per
dollar
trump
also
loomed
large
in
oil
markets
with
crude
taking
a
spill
after
he
tweeted
that
saudi
arabia
had
agreed
to
lift
oil
production
by
maybe
up
to
barrels
the
missive
was
later
played
down
by
the
white
house
and
saudi
press
agency
brent
crude
lost
cents
to
a
barrel
while
crude
fell
cents
to
the
pullback
was
still
modest
given
crude
rallied
more
than
percent
last
week
while
brent
gained
more
than
percent
