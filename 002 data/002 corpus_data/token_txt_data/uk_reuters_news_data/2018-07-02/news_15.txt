argentina
will
allow
fuel
retailers
to
freely
set
pump
prices
starting
in
august
according
to
an
energy
ministry
official
familiar
with
the
plan
a
move
that
could
encourage
badly
needed
investment
in
the
nation
s
oil
patch
but
risks
worsening
inflation
and
angering
consumers
separately
the
ministry
is
looking
to
set
up
an
auction
process
for
the
market
that
it
hopes
will
lower
prices
according
to
the
official
who
was
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
the
actions
signal
that
president
mauricio
macri
is
moving
ahead
with
reforms
to
attract
private
investment
to
develop
the
nation
s
abundant
shale
oil
reserves
even
as
rising
global
oil
prices
and
a
precipitous
weakening
of
the
nation
s
currency
have
led
to
pressure
for
more
interventionist
government
policies
the
moves
will
also
bring
relief
to
the
oil
sector
price
controls
have
squeezed
refiners
margins
prompting
one
refinery
to
suspend
operations
macri
s
government
freed
fuel
prices
last
year
part
of
its
efforts
to
unwind
state
controls
on
argentina
s
economy
but
his
administration
reversed
course
in
may
due
to
a
rapid
decline
in
the
peso
the
sudden
depreciation
rattled
markets
and
prompted
argentina
to
turn
to
the
international
monetary
fund
imf
for
emergency
financing
in
may
the
government
reached
a
deal
for
a
freeze
on
pump
prices
with
the
three
largest
oil
companies
operating
in
argentina
ypf
shell
and
bp
s
pan
american
energy
it
later
set
the
price
of
domestic
crude
at
about
below
the
global
brent
crude
price
to
mitigate
the
impact
of
freezing
fuel
prices
on
refiners
margins
by
freeing
pump
prices
the
government
is
betting
that
gas
stations
will
limit
price
hikes
to
avoid
losing
customers
the
official
said
and
that
by
freeing
crude
prices
it
would
encourage
more
investment
in
domestic
drilling
part
of
a
strategy
to
wean
argentina
from
petroleum
imports
price
controls
do
not
help
with
anything
the
official
said
the
government
and
the
oil
companies
agreed
to
loosen
the
freeze
june
allowing
for
hikes
of
percent
in
june
and
percent
in
july
macri
s
administration
had
kept
the
industry
guessing
as
to
what
it
might
do
in
august
th
earlier
increases
were
unsatisfactory
to
oil
industry
players
three
of
whom
complained
privately
to
reuters
that
the
modest
bumps
did
not
come
close
to
covering
their
increased
costs
last
month
global
trader
trafigura
announced
it
was
suspending
activities
at
its
refinery
in
the
port
city
of
bahia
blanca
due
to
the
mismatch
between
fuel
prices
and
production
and
import
an
oil
industry
executive
who
spoke
with
reuters
recently
expressed
frustration
with
the
bind
the
adjustment
that
needs
to
be
done
is
not
percent
it
is
percent
said
the
person
who
requested
anonymity
to
speak
freely
vaca
muerta
an
end
to
retail
price
caps
would
likely
infuriate
argentine
consumers
who
are
already
incensed
at
the
government
for
the
drop
in
the
peso
and
inflation
that
is
running
at
a
percent
annual
clip
but
macri
s
government
has
prioritized
reviving
the
energy
sector
to
shake
argentina
s
dependence
on
imported
oil
and
gas
and
to
put
an
end
to
subsidies
argentina
possesses
the
world
s
reserves
of
shale
natural
gas
and
ranks
no
in
reserves
of
shale
oil
mostly
in
the
vaca
muerta
fields
in
patagonia
but
it
faces
stiff
competition
to
attract
the
billions
in
private
investment
needed
to
develop
these
resources
oil
production
is
languishing
at
lows
the
picture
is
brighter
with
natural
gas
rising
output
in
vaca
muerta
helped
boost
the
country
s
production
by
percent
in
the
first
quarter
of
compared
with
the
same
period
last
year
according
to
government
data
we
are
beginning
to
have
an
abundance
of
gas
in
argentina
the
energy
ministry
official
said
as
a
result
the
ministry
will
create
an
auction
process
for
wholesale
customers
to
bid
on
the
open
market
for
their
natural
gas
supplies
during
the
summer
months
the
official
said
the
plan
is
to
phase
out
the
current
system
in
a
move
the
government
hopes
will
lower
prices
the
auctions
could
start
in
september
or
october
and
could
account
for
as
much
as
percent
of
wholesale
supply
by
march
or
april
of
the
official
said
argentina
is
also
expected
to
begin
gas
exports
to
chile
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
this
year
another
result
of
rising
vaca
muerta
output
argentina
will
still
need
to
import
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
to
meet
demand
in
winter
months
