a
renewed
slide
in
chinese
shares
and
a
sobering
set
of
factory
surveys
sucked
asian
markets
lower
on
monday
while
the
euro
and
the
mexican
peso
were
both
jolted
by
political
developments
at
home

followed
with
a

european

blue

their
slide
with
a

across

drop
last

japan

nikkei
shed

to

low
with
a
survey
of

darkened

the

index
pmi
still
edged

for

but
exports
orders
softened
tension
is
growing
ahead
of
a
july
deadline
when
the
is
due
to
impose
us
billion
of
tariffs
on
chinese
exports
the
key
risk
for
the
market
isn
t
that
trump
actually
implements
his
trade
threats
but
rather
that
a
protracted
period
of
trade
uncertainty
begins
to
weigh
on
economic
activity
said
analysts
at
jpmorgan
in
a
note
the
evidence
suggesting
this
is
happening
is
far
from
conclusive
but
ominous
data
points
are
two
surveys
of
chinese
manufacturing
out
in
the
last
few
days
showed
a
softening
in
activity
partly
due
to
softness
in
exports
a
slew
of
factory
readings
from
across
the
globe
are
due
on
monday
while
the
ism
report
is
out
on

minutes
of

meeting
come
on

and
the

closes
with
payrolls
for
june
in
currency
markets
the
euro
took
an
early
knock
on
reports
german
interior
minister
horst
seehofer
had
rejected
a
migration
deal
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
negotiated
at
a
european
union
summit
on
friday
the
currency
then
partly
bounced
on
news
seehofer
had
offered
to
step
down
as
minister
and
as
chair
of
his
christian
social
union
csu
party
the
move
makes
the
future
of
merkel
s
government
even
more
uncertain
as
her
christian
democrats
party
cdu
relies
on
the
csu
to
maintain
power
through
a
coalition
formed
three
months
ago
to
end
a
political
vacuum
after
all
that
the
euro
was
percent
easier
at
having
skidded
as
far
as
at
one
stage
the
dollar
gained
percent
on
a
basket
of
currencies
to
but
was
still
below
friday
s
top
of
it
was
flat
on
the
yen
at
having
been
as
high
as
at
one
stage
the
mexican
peso
after
leftist
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
won
a
decisive
victory
for
president
dealers
said
the
clear
win
might
settle
one
source
of
political
uncertainty
but
obrador
was
also
expected
to
sharpen
mexican
divisions
with
president
donald
trump
after
an
initial
retreat
the
dollar
soon
rebounded
to
be
flat
at
pesos
up
from
last
week
s
trough
around
trump
also
loomed
large
in
oil
markets
with
crude
taking
a
spill
after
he
tweeted
that
saudi
arabia
had
agreed
to
lift
oil
production
by
maybe
up
to
barrels
the
missive
was
later
downplayed
by
the
white
house
and
saudi
press
agency
brent
crude
lost
cents
to
a
barrel
while
crude
fell
cents
to
the
pullback
was
still
modest
given
crude
rallied
more
than
percent
last
week
while
brent
gained
more
than
percent
