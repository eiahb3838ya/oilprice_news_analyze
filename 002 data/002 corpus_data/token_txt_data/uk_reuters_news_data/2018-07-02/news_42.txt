asian
shares
were
subdued
early
monday
ahead
of
a
week
packed
with
major
economic
events
while
the
euro
was
briefly
shaken
by
signs
a
german
political
deal
on
immigration
might
be
in
trouble
oil
prices
also
took
an
early
spill
in
the
wake
of
president
donald
trump
s
tweet
that
saudi
arabia
had
agreed
to
lift
oil
production
by
maybe
up
to
barrels
the
missive
was
later
downplayed
by
the
white
house
and
saudi
press
agency
brent
crude
was
down
cents
at
a
barrel
while
crude
fell
cents
to
the
pullback
was
modest
given
crude
rallied
more
than
percent
last
week
while
brent
gained
more
than
percent
in
share
markets
japan
s
nikkei
dipped
percent
with
a
survey
of
manufacturers
showing
sentiment
had
darkened
a
shade
in
the
face
of
trade
war
threats
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
was
a
fraction
firmer
in
early
trade
the
index
shed
percent
last
week
as
trade
concerns
clouded
the
outlook
for
chinese
growth
and
pressured
asset
prices
there
tension
is
growing
ahead
of
a
july
deadline
when
the
and
china
are
due
to
impose
us
billion
of
tariffs
on
their
respective
imports
the
key
risk
for
the
market
isn
t
that
trump
actually
implements
his
trade
threats
but
rather
that
a
protracted
period
of
trade
uncertainty
begins
to
weigh
on
economic
activity
said
analysts
at
jpmorgan
in
a
note
the
evidence
suggesting
this
is
happening
is
far
from
conclusive
but
ominous
data
points
are
a
survey
out
over
the
weekend
showed
chinese
manufacturing
activity
cooled
a
little
in
june
as
export
orders
fell
the
official
purchasing
managers
index
pmi
eased
in
june
from
in
may
a
slew
of
readings
on
manufacturing
across
the
globe
are
due
later
on
monday
while
the
ism
report
is
out
on
tuesday
minutes
of
the
last
federal
reserve
policy
meeting
come
on
thursday
and
the
week
closes
with
payrolls
for
june
in
currency
markets
the
euro
took
an
early
knock
on
reports
german
interior
minister
horst
seehofer
had
rejected
a
migration
deal
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
negotiated
at
a
european
union
summit
on
friday
the
currency
then
bounced
on
news
seehofer
had
offered
to
step
down
as
minister
and
as
chair
of
his
christian
social
union
csu
party
the
move
makes
the
future
of
merkel
s
government
even
more
uncertain
as
her
christian
democrats
party
cdu
relies
on
the
csu
to
maintain
power
through
a
coalition
formed
three
months
ago
to
end
a
political
vacuum
after
all
that
the
euro
was
a
fraction
easier
at
having
skidded
as
far
as
at
one
stage
the
dollar
was
still
a
touch
weaker
on
a
basket
of
currencies
at
having
recoiled
from
a
top
on
friday
it
was
steady
on
the
yen
at
after
failing
to
clear
stiff
resistance
around
last
week
