lashed
out
at
opec
with
a
warning

stop
manipulating
oil
markets
and
piled
pressure
on
ally
saudi
arabia
to
raise
supplies
to
compensate
for
lower
exports
from
iran
trump
said
in
a
tweet
on
saturday
that
saudi
arabia
s
king
salman
bin
abdulaziz
al
saud
had
agreed
to
produce
more
oil
the
white
house
later
walked
back
the
president
s
comments
saying
the
king
had
said
his
country
could
raise
oil
production
if
needed
on
sunday
in
an
interview
with
fox
news
sunday
morning
futures
with
maria
bartiromo
trump
reiterated
his
call
on
saudi
arabia
to
raise
production
to
a
new
record
arguing
that
it
should
help
the
united
states
lower
fuel
prices
since
washington
is
helping
riyadh
in
its
struggle
against
tehran
don
t
forget
the
one
negative
to
the
iran
deal
is
that
you
lose
a
lot
of
oil
and
they
got
to
make
up
for
it
and
who
is
their
big
enemy
iran
you
think
of
it
iran
is
their
big
enemy
so
they
are
going
to
have
to
do
it
trump
said
and
i
have
a
very
good
relationship
with
the
saudi
king
and
with
the
crown
prince
of
saudi
arabia
and
with
the
others
around
and
they
are
going
to
have
to
put
out
more
oil
prices
rose
last
week
on
worries
that
sanctions
against
iran
would
take
away
significant
volumes
of
crude
oil
from
world
markets
while
oil
demand
worldwide
increases
earlier
this
year
to
the
chagrin
of
european
partners
trump
said
he
would
pull
the
united
states
out
of
the
iran
nuclear
agreement
secured
by
world
powers
on
monday
brent
oil
prices
were
around
percent
lower
but
not
far
from
per
barrel
as
analysts
have
warned
of
thin
global
spare
capacity
to
offset
potential
supply
disruptions
rising
gasoline
prices
could
create
a
political
headache
for
trump
ahead
of
the
november
elections
by
offsetting
republican
claims
that
his
tax
cuts
and
rollbacks
of
federal
regulations
have
helped
boost
the
economy
on
fox
trump
directed
blame
at
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
of
which
saudi
arabia
is
the
biggest
producer
asked
whether
someone
was
manipulating
oil
markets
trump
said
percent
opec
is
and
they
better
stop
it
because
we
re
protecting
those
countries
many
of
those
opec
is
manipulating
and
you
know
they
allowed
a
production
increase
less
than
we
thought
last
week
they
have
to
put
out
another
million
barrels
in
my
opinion
because
we
don
t
want
that
happening
trump
said
trump
was
referring
to
opec
s
decision
to
raise
output
together
with
its
allies
by
around
million
barrels
per
day
although
since
then
saudi
arabia
has
pledged
to
raise
production
to
a
new
record
saudi
arabia
has
been
pumping
around
million
bpd
in
recent
months
and
sources
close
to
its
oil
policy
have
said
it
could
raise
output
to
million
bpd
trump
s
suggestion
means
he
wants
riyadh
to
increase
production
to
million
bpd
something
the
kingdom
has
never
done
in
the
past
trump
will
visit
europe
this
month
for
a
meeting
with
nato
allies
whom
he
has
criticized
sharply
as
paying
too
little
for
their
joint
defence
trade
tensions
are
likely
to
overshadow
that
trip
trump
has
imposed
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
in
response
to
what
he
calls
unfair
trade
practices
from
europe
canada
and
other
allies
around
the
world
who
have
responded
with
retaliatory
sanctions
in
kind
on
trade
the
president
said
in
the
fox
interview
that
he
was
not
happy
with
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
and
would
not
agree
a
new
one
until
after
the
november
elections
i
want
to
wait
until
after
the
election
