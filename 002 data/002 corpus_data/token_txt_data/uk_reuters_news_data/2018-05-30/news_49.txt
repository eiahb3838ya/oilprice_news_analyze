pay
attention
to
what
traders
actually
do
not
what
they

is
one
of
the
most
important
principles
for
successful

analysis
despite
all
the
bullish
commentary
around
oil
prices
in
recent
weeks
there
was
plenty
of
forewarning
prices
were
primed
for
a
setback
by
the
middle
of
april
hedge

had
accumulated
a

brent
futures
prices
continued
to
climb
by
another
per
barrel
over
the
next
five
weeks
with
the
focus
on
declining
oil
exports
from
venezuela
and
new
sanctions
on
iran
but
a
closer
look
at
the
market
revealed
plenty
of
signs
the
rally
might
be
running
out
of
momentum
and
was
becoming
increasingly
vulnerable
to
a
correction
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
were
net
sellers
of
petroleum
futures
and
options
in
each
of
the
five
weeks
between
april
and
may
bullish
long
positions
were
trimmed
by
million
barrels
while
the
number
of
bearish
short
positions
rose
by
million
the
shift
was
even
more
pronounced
in
crude
where
long
positions
were
trimmed
by
million
barrels
while
shorts
were
boosted
by
million
brent
futures
slumped
from
backwardation
into
contango
in
part
because
so
many
hedge
fund
positions
are
concentrated
at
the
of
the
futures
curve
the
physical
brent
market
too
displayed
increasing
signs
of
weakness
with
dated
brent
prices
falling
into
contango
and
reports
of
unsold
cargoes
weakness
spread
along
the
futures
curve
with
the
brent
calendar
spread
easing
from
a
sharp
backwardation
of
per
barrel
on
april
to
just
on
may
since
the
start
of
large
concentrations
of
long
or
short
positions
by
hedge
funds
in
the
oil
market
have
usually
heralded
an
imminent
reversal
in
the
recent

trend
lopsided
positioning
can
cause
a
reversal
even
in

absence
of
significant
new
information
about
production
or
consumption

but
in
recent
weeks
several
new
pieces
of

suggested
the
rally
might
run
out
of
momentum
and
be
thrown
into

attention
from

on

president
donald
trump
blamed
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
for
raising
prices
to
unacceptably
high
levels
with

opportunity
wrote
to
the
president
blaming
opec
for
the
rise
in
prices
and
calling
on
him
to
put
pressure
on
the
organisation
and
particularly
saudi
arabia
to
boost
oil
supplies
elsewhere
india
s
gasoline
and

prices
have
surged
to
record
levels
prompting
the
country
s
oil
minister
to
blame
opec
for
restricting

seen
a
widespread
truckers
strike
blockading

after

hit

levels
forcing

opec
led
by
saudi
arabia
and
its
allies
led
by
russia
are
increasingly
blamed
for
the
increase
in
oil
prices
by
restricting
their
production
despite
strong
growth
in
consumption
falling
output
from
venezuela
and
the
prospective
reduction
in
exports
from
iran
have
highlighted
how
far
opec
and
its
allies
are
in
danger
of
undershooting
their
collective
production
target
for
saudi
arabia
is
in
a
particularly
delicate
position
because
it
has
urged
the
united
states
to
impose
sanctions
on
iran
but
does
not
want
to
be
blamed
for
increasing
motorists
fuel
costs
in
a
election
year
in
response
opec
sources
have
started
to
signal
their
willingness
to
increase
output
to
compensate
for
losses
from
venezuela
and
iran
reversing
their
earlier
position
that
output
would
be
unchanged
until
the
end
of
communications
from
opec
about
a
possible
production
increase
in
the
second
half
of
seem
to
have
provided
the
trigger
for
the
sharp
in
oil
prices
that
started
on
may
but
the
pressure
for
a
change
of
opec
strategy
had
been
intensifying
for
several
weeks
and
at
least
some
traders
had
already
begun
to
anticipate
the
shift
by
adjusting
their

well
