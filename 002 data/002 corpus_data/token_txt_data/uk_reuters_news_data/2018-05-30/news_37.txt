morocco
has
won
praise
from
imf
for
economic
reforms
but
many

a
consumer
boycott
aimed
at
major
suppliers
of
milk
bottled
water
and
petrol
in
morocco
has
prompted
the
government
to
call
for
lower
prices
and
forced
one
firm
to
scale
down
operations
the
secretly
organised
campaign
is
the
first
such
mass
online
protest
in
morocco
which
escaped
the
arab
spring
uprisings
of
but
where
demonstrations
have
erupted
in
impoverished
areas
over
jobs
and
economic
neglect
the
international
monetary
fund
has
praised
morocco
for
opening
up
its
economy
which
has
helped
attract
investment
by
major
international
firms
such
as
renault
boeing
and
bombardier
but
the
campaign
launched
on
april
and
calling
for
a
boycott
of
morocco
s
main
milk
water
and
petrol
brands
has
struck
a
raw
nerve
with
many
who
complain
they
have
been
left
out
of
the
business
boom
facebook
pages
with
more
than
million
users
have
backed
the
campaign
which
no
political
or
civil
society
group
has
claimed
but
which
aims
to
express
the
frustration
many
moroccans
feel
about
their
circumstances
the
goal
of
this
boycott
is
to
unite
the
moroccan
people
and
speak
with
one
voice
against
expensive
prices
poverty
unemployment
injustice
corruption
and
despotism
one
of
the
boycott
pages
said
the
campaign
targets

one
of
morocco

french
dairy
firm
centrale
danone
and
the
sidi
ali
water
brand
the
three
firms
have
not
detailed
the
impact
on
their
businesses
but
several
grocery
shops
in
the
capital
rabat
said
they
had
sold
less
milk
and
water
from
the
firms
under
fire
since
the
boycott
started
my
customers
are
opting
for
other
milk
products
said
a
rabat
grocery
owner
who
gave
his
name
as
younes
sidi
ali
and
afriquia
did
not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for

a
survey
in
the

minister

prime
minister
saad
eddine
el
othmani
urged
companies
to
lower
prices
of
popular
goods
while
distancing
himself
from
other
officials
who
had
described
the
boycotters
as
deluded
a
spokesman
for
centrale
danone
speaking
on
national
television
acknowledged
an
impact
on
sales
without
giving
details
for
the
holy
month
of
ramadan
the
company
lowered
the
retail
price
of
milk
by
one
dirham
a
litre
the
company
told
reuters
by
email
that
because
of
the
boycott
and
despite
its
temporary
price
cut
it
had
decided
on
wednesday
to
reduce
by
percent
the
amount
of
milk
it
collects
from
the
farmers
who
supply
it
this
would
also
affect
its
own
staff
as
the
company
said
it
would
end
contracts
of
temporary
workers
without
giving
the
exact
number

an
attempt

its

calling
on
the

to
lower

morocco
saw
some
protests
in
which
led
king
mohammed
vi
to
agree
limited
constitutional
reforms
included
devolving
some
powers
to
an
elected
government
but
it
has
escaped
the
major
uprisings
seen
elsewhere
in
the
region
officials
have
been
promoting
the
kingdom
as
a
stable
investment
destination
at
a
time
when
tunisia
has
been
unable
to
fix
an
economic
crisis
and
there
is
uncertainty
in
algeria
over
the
health
of
president
abdelaziz
bouteflika
who
suffered
a
stroke
in
but
protests
in
a
poor
mining
town
in
morocco
s
northeast
at
the
start
of
the
year
and
in
hoceima
in
the
rif
region
in
over
corruption
and
poverty
are
signs
of
lingering
dissent
the
boycott
call
has
targeted
the
three
firms
as
symbols
of
an
economy
dominated
by
large
groups
linked
to
a
business
and
political
elite
or
foreign
brands
the
boycott
goes
beyond
lowering
prices
to
express
an
outcry
at
the
feeble
purchasing
power
of
citizens
as
a
result
of
the
marriage
between
power
and
business
said
fouad
abdelmoumni
an
activist
backing
the
campaign
market
share
for
their
products
are
percent
for
afriquia
percent
for
central
danone
and
percent
for
les
eaux
minérales
d
oulmès
analysts
say
they
were
targeted
because
they
are
perceived
as
market
leaders
who
engage
in
price
fixing
creating
an
oligopoly
said
rachid
aourraz
economist
at
the
moroccan
institute
for
policy
analysis
a
bottle
of
mineral
water
costs
six
dirhams
cents
more
than
in
some
european
countries
although
the
purchasing
power
of
moroccans
is
much
lower
the
boycott
call
has
prompted
a
parliamentary
inquiry
into
fuel
prices
which
found
that
since
fuel
subsidies
ended
in
a
move
praised
by
the
imf
petrol
distributors
profits
have
risen

the

dirhams
the
previous

all
distributors
sell
at
the
same
consumer
prices
in
different
moroccan
regions
said
idris
azami
head
of
the
islamist
pjd

which
is
part
of
the

government
this
is
detrimental
to
competition
he
said
adding
that
an
active
competition
regulator
was
needed
the
competition
council
has
been
idle
because
authorities
have
not
appointed
a
new
board
after
the
old
