he
denied
had
alleged
exxon
withheld
information
about
its
internal
climate
change
discussions
and
misled
the
public
about
what
it
knew
exxon
has
long
denied
the
charges
here
the
investigation
has
spread
to
other
states
including
massachusetts
and
has
put
exxon
squarely
in
the
middle
of
the
ongoing
debate
about
fossil
fuels
and
climate
change

being
part

the
solution
on
climate
woods
added
he
has
not
reached
out
to
barbara
underwood

was
appointed
to
replace
schneiderman
he
said
he
was
not
sure
if
exxon
attorneys
have
talked
to
underwood
or
her
office
i
m
real
confident
on
where
we
stand
i
hope
whoever
comes
in
steps
back
and
takes
an
objective
look
and
comes
to
a
different
conclusion
woods
said

the

help
it
transition
to
a
lower
carbon
future
dinapoli
