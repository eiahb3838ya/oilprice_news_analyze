dubai
reuters
iran
has
asked
opec
to
support
it
against
new
sanctions
and
signalled
it
is
not
yet
in
agreement
with
saudi
arabia
s
views
on
the
possible
need
to
increase
global
oil
supplies
creating
potential
problems
for
opec
at
its
meeting
next
month
iran
the
of
saudi
arabia
has
a
history
of
being
difficult
at
opec
meetings
including
in
when
the
country
refused
to
sign
up
to
opec
policies
saying
it
needed
to
raise
output
due
to
the
easing
of
sanctions
following
tehran
s
accord
with
major
world
powers
president
donald
trump
earlier
this
month
pulled
out
of
that
nuclear
deal
with
iran
and
announced
the
highest
level
of
sanctions
against
the
opec
member
iran
is
the
oil
producer
in
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
after
saudi
arabia
and
iraq
i
would
like
to
seek
opec
s
support
in
accordance
with
article
of
the
opec
statute
which
emphasises
safeguarding
the
interests
of
member
countries
individually
and
collectively
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
in
a
letter
seen
by
reuters
zanganeh
also
suggested
in
the
letter
that
iran
was
not
in
agreement
with
some
opec
ministers
recent
comments
on
the
oil
market
he
said
some
opec
ministers
have
implicitly
or
unwittingly
spoken
for
the
organisation
expressing
views
that
might
be
perceived
as
the
official
position
of
the
the
energy
ministers
of
saudi
arabia
and
russia
said
last
week
they
were
prepared
to
ease
output
cuts
to
calm
consumer
worries
about
supply
raising
output
would
bring
an
end
to
about
months
of
strict
supply
curbs
amid
concerns
that
oil
price
have
risen
too
far
oil
price
have
hit
their
highest
since
late
rising
above
a
barrel
this
month
but
have
since
eased
since
the
original
sanctions
were
lifted
iran
has
struggled
to
raise
production
above
million
barrels
per
day
due
to
a
lack
of
new
projects
and
the
caution
of
western
investors
so
if
opec
decides
to
increase
supplies
iran
is
likely
to
benefit
less
than
saudi
arabia
because
it
would
struggle
to
raise
output
while
it
would
also
be
hit
by
lower
oil
prices
zanganeh
s
letter
was
addressed
to
the
united
arab
emirates
energy
minister
suhail
who
holds
opec
presidency
in
zanganeh
also
said
that
if
the
latest
sanctions
threat
was
resolved
iran
reserves
the
right
to
return
to
its
oil
market
share
in
the
shortest
possible
time
and
resumes
its
normal
and
will
not
accept
any
limitations
in
this
zanganeh
asked
mazrouei

separate
agenda
