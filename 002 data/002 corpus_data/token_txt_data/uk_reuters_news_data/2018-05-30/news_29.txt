reuters
saudi
arabia
other
opec
states
and
allies
aim
to
stick
to
a
global
pact
on
cutting
oil
supplies
until
the
end
of
but
are
ready
to
make
gradual
adjustments
to
offset
any
supply
shortage
a
gulf
source
familiar
with
saudi
thinking
said
the
oil
producers
participating
in
the
output
reduction
deal
are
satisfied
with
the
result
of
their
agreement
which
was
due
to
end
at
the
end
of
the
gulf
source
told
reuters
the
deal
could
be
extended
to
achieve
its
objectives
of
keeping
a
balanced
oil
market
the
source
said
adding
that
when
needed
any
rise
in
output
would
be
in
a
gradual
and
deliberate
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
with
russia
and
several
other
producers
agreed
to
cut
output
by
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
starting
from
january
the
curbs
have
driven
down
inventories
and
pushed
up
prices
the
oil
market
is
moving
towards
balancing
and
fundamentals
are
better
than
last
year
but
the
group
is
not
ready
yet
to
fully
lift
controls
the
gulf
source
said
the
source
added
that
the
market
was
driven
by
a
fear
of
shortage
triggered
by
a
steep
decline
in
venezuela
s
output
and
worries
about
the
impact
of
sanctions
on
iranian
production
rather
than
an
actual
lack
of
supply
saudi
arabia
opec
and
are
continuing
their
cooperation
this
year
and
beyond
it
is
not
something
temporary
it
is
going
to
be
a
cooperation
for
the
sake
of
a
stable
oil
market
the
gulf
source
said
however
if
any
shortage
takes
place
the
producers
will
coordinate
closely
and
promptly
take
necessary
actions
the
opec
and
agreement
will
remain
in
place
but
the
level
of
the
cut
may
be
adjusted
if
a
physical
shortage

ministers
of
saudi
arabia
and
russia
said
last
week
they
were
prepared
to
ease
output
cuts
to
calm
consumer
worries
about
supply
adequacy
raising
output
would
ease
about
months
of
strict
supply
curbs
amid
concerns
that
a
price
rally
has
gone
too
far
with
oil
hitting
its
highest
since
late
rising
above
a
barrel
this
month
prices
have
since
eased
sources
told
reuters
last
week
that
saudi
arabia
and
russia
were
discussing
the
possibility
of
raising
output
by
about
million
bpd
opec
meets
next
on
june
to
decide
on
policy
the
gulf
source
said
no
decision
has
been
taken
about
the
timing
of
any
increase
or
the
amount
and
said
saudi
arabia
opec
s
biggest
producer
favoured
a
gradual
increase
in
output
if
there
was
a
need
the
source
said
any
decision
to
increase
output
in
june
would
coincide
with
anticipated
higher
demand
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
saudi
arabia
favours
a
gradual
approach
to
increase
output
to
compensate
for
any
unplanned
outages
the
decision
about
the
timing
and
amount
of
oil
to
raise
will
be
decided
when
the
ministers
meet
in
june
the
gulf
source
said
the
increase
in
output
will
be
dictated
by
market
conditions
and
all
the
numbers
circulated
about
size
of
the
increase
or
the
timing
are
mere
speculation
the
source
said
adding
that
any
move
would
be
a
