pars
gas
project
lifting
its

total
s
ceo
patrick
pouyanne
said
last
week
that
the
only
way
for
the
company
to
continue
their
project
in
iran
would
be
to
have
a
special
waiver
but
added
that
it
s
quite
european
powers
still
see
the
nuclear
accord
as
the
best
chance
of
stopping
tehran
from
acquiring
a
nuclear
weapon
and
have
intensified
efforts
to
save
the
pact
zanganeh
also
said
on
state

that
an
agreement
with
europe
would
inspire
other
potential
buyers
of
iranian
oil
europe
is
buying
only
one
third
of
iranian
oil
but
an
agreement
with
europe
is
important
to
guarantee
our
sales
and
find
insurance
for
the
ships
ferrying
the
crude
other
buyers
would
also
be
inspired
by
this

s
oil
producer
said
on
tuesday
that
it
had
decided
not
to
go
ahead
with
plans
to
develop
projects
in
iran
because
of
the
threat
of
sanctions
iran

crude
oil
exports
declined
slightly
in
may
according
to
estimates
from
a
leading
company
in

first
sign
that
the

of
sanctions
may
be
deterring
buyers
