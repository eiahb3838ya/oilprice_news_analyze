brazilian
oil
workers
planned
a
strike
starting
on
wednesday
despite
a
court
order
in
a
new
blow
to
president
michel
temer
and
an
economy
reeling
from
a
truckers
protest
that
has
strangled
latin
america
s
largest
economy
for
over
a
week
the
planned
oil
strike
was
declared
illegal
by
brazil
s
top
labor
court
on
tuesday
the
fup
brazil
s
largest
oil
workers
union
said
it
had
not
been
informed
of
the
ruling
and
planned
to
go
ahead
with
the
stoppage
oil
firm
petroleo
brasileiro
sa
said
any
such
disruption
would
not
have
an
immediate
major
impact
on
its
production
or
overall
operations
but
the
planned
strike
raised
the
specter
of
stoppages
and
protests
spreading
to
other
sectors
as
brazilians
vent
frustrations
with
a
deeply
unpopular
government
and
a
economy
petrobras
as
the
oil
company
is
known
along
with
the
federal
government
s
solicitor
general
s
office
on
tuesday
had
asked
the
country
s
top
labor
court
to
rule
that
any
oil
strike
would
be
illegal
arguing
it
was
being
carried
out
mainly
for
political
and
not
reasons
unions
representing
oil
workers
said
they
were
demanding
the
resignation
of
chief
executive
pedro
parente
they
also
want
the
reversal
of
changes
to
pricing
and
other
policies
petrobras
has
taken
since
temer
took
power
in
fup
union
leader
jos√©
maria
rangel
said
on
tuesday
the
temer
government
and
parente
s
policies
were
delivering
petrobras
up
to
foreign
investors
while
the
shipyards
of
rio
de
janeiro
are
closed
amid
a
jobless
rate
that
remains
near
highs
parente
on
a
tuesday
conference
call
with
analysts
said
petrobras
was
taking
action
so
that
any
strike
would
have
minimal
or
no
impact
on
production
and
operations
the
trucker
demonstration
against
diesel
price
hikes
has
emptied
roads
and
left
major
cities
running
short
on
food
gasoline
and
medical
supplies
despite
significantly
easing
on
tuesday
night
officials
warned
it
would
take
days
to
restore
supply
lines
disrupted
by
the
crippling
stoppage
that
at
its
height
saw
over
roadblocks
on
key
highways
across
the
country
temer
s
political
situation
has
grown
so
tenuous
as
brazil
barrels
toward
a
general
election
in
october
that
he
was
forced
to
bat
away
concerns
that
a
coup
could
topple
his
government
there
is
zero
chance
of
military
intervention
temer
told
a
small
group
of
journalists
during
a
roundtable
at
an
investment
conference
in
sao
paulo
what
i
see
is
a
rejection
both
in
the
ministry
of
defense
and
throughout
the
military
forces
to
any
kind
of
military
