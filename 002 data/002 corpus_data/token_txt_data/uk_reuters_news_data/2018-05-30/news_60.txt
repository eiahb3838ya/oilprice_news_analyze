number of electric vehicles on roads reaches 3 million-iea
london

the
number
of
electric
vehicles
on
roads
worldwide
rose
to
a
record
high
of
million
in
but
more
research
policies
and
incentives
are
needed
to
drive
further
uptake
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
the
number
of
electric
cars
including
hybrid
electric
and
fuel
cell
electric
passenger
vehicles
increased
by
percent
compared
with
the
iea
said
in
a
report
china
accounted
for
percent
of
the
global
total
last
year
research
and
development
policy
support
charging
infrastructure
investment
and
production
improvements
are
resulting
in
lower
battery
costs
and
higher
electric
vehicle
ev
uptake
battery
costs
however
are
still
a
major
component
of
ev
costs
so
financial
incentives
such
as
rebates
tax
breaks
or
exemptions
will
be
needed
to
support
electric
car
deployment
dynamic
market
uptake
of
electric
vehicles
has
occurred
in
recent
years
the
iea
said
in
a
report
ongoing
support
and
commitments
for
increased
deployment
of
evs
from
policy
makers
and
the
automotive
industry
suggest
that
this
trend
is
not
going
to
abate
in
the
coming
decade
it
added
by
the
iea
estimates
there
will
be
million
evs
on
the
road
based
on
existing
and
announced
policies
that
could
rise
to
million
if
policies
become
more
ambitious
to
meet
global
climate
goals
and
other
sustainability
targets
the
shift
to
evs
will
increase
demand
for
some
materials
especially
cobalt
and
lithium
used
in
batteries
cobalt
demand
is
expected
to
be
ten
times
higher
than
current
levels
by
at
kilotonnes
kt
per
year
under
current
policies
and
could
be
as
much
as
times
higher
at
with
more
ambitious
government
policies
the
iea
estimates
lithium
demand
is
forecast
to
be
by
based
on
current
policies
and
if
more
ambitious
polices
are
implemented
so
far
rising
numbers
of
evs
on
the
road
have
had
a
limited
impact
on
electricity
demand
in
estimated
global
electricity
demand
from
all
evs
was
terrawatt
hours
equivalent
to
slightly
more
than
the
power
demand
of
greece
however
as
electric
vehicle
uptake
continues
to
rise
their
charging
will
increase
electricity
demand
and
impact
transmission
and
distribution
grids
