brazil
s
president
michel
temer
may
scrap
a
pricing
mechanism
used
by
oil
firm
petrobras
and
revert
to
selling
all
fuel
below
costs
after
a
trucking
strike
that
almost
paralysed
the
nation
a
government
source
told
reuters
on
tuesday
talk
of
temporarily
lowering
prices
on
just
diesel
to
end
the
havoc
the
strike
brought
on
latin
america
s
largest
economy
sent
petrobras
shares
plunging
percent
on
monday
truckers
are
protesting
a
percent
increase
in
diesel
prices
under
the
nearly
petrobras
policy
of
almost
daily
adjustments
following
international
prices
the
source
who
asked
not
to
be
named
because
he
was
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
on
the
matter
said
the
pricing
policy
worked
well
when
oil
prices
held
steady
for
years
at
a
barrel
and
the
brazilian
currency
brby
remained
stable
against
the
dollar
but
oil
has
recently
surged
to
a
barrel
boosted
by
plummeting
venezuelan
production
strong
global
demand
and
looming
sanctions
on
iran
meanwhile
brazil
s
currency
has
weakened
percent
this
year
on
political
uncertainty
without
that
stability
we
have
a
problem
we
need
to
study
alternatives
the
official
said
he
said
talks
on
the
issue
have
already
begun
between
the
government
and
petrobras
a
spokeswoman
for
petrobras
chief
executive
officer
pedro
parente
declined
to
comment
temer
acknowledged
in
a
television
interview
on
tuesday
that
he
was
open
to
reviewing
the
pricing
policy
petrobras
has
recovered
in
these
two
years
it
had
been
in
a
disastrous
situation
for
a
long
time
and
we
did
not
want
to
change
the
company
s
policy
temer
told
government
broadcaster
tv
brasil
we
can
the
policy
though
with
great
on
sunday
moving
to
settle
the
truckers
strike
temer
announced
tax
cuts
and
subsidies
to
reduce
domestic
diesel
prices
by
real
per
litre
or
about
percent
of
the
current
price
at
the
pump
freezing
them
at
that
level
for
days
the
prospect
of
government
interference
in
petrobras
pricing
policy
sent
its
share
prices
plummeting
on
monday
that
slide
added
to
losses
a
week
earlier
that
reduced
the
stock
price
by
nearly
one
third
though
shares
rebounded
percent
on
tuesday
to
close
at
reais
the
government
official
said
initial
talks
had
begun
between
mines
and
energy
minister
moreira
franco
and
parente
architect
of
the
company
s
recovery
parente
has
resisted
change
but
has
appreciated
the
need
for
greater
predictability
in
price
adjustments
the
official
said
this
version
of
the
story
corrects
third
paragraph
to
reflect
that
daily
pricing
adjustments
began
nearly
one
year
ago
not
two
years
ago
