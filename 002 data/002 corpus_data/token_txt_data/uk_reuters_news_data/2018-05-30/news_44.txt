hopes
that
italy
might
avoid
a
potentially
damaging
general
election
lifted
european
markets
on
wednesday
bringing
italian
bond
yields
off
highs
and
dampening
some
of
the
recent
buying
interest
for
german
and
government
bonds
the
backdrop
for
world
markets
remained
sombre
however
as
the
united
states
revived
trade
war
fears
with
an
announcement
that
it
would
press
ahead
with
tariffs
and
restrictions
on
chinese
investments
and
beijing
threatened
to
retaliate
the
prospect
of
acrimony
between
the
world
s
biggest
two
economies
added
to
fears
for
the
global
economy
already
feeling
the
hit
from
the
risk
of
an
crisis
in
the
euro
zone
however
equity
futures
signalled
wall
street
indexes
would
open
around
half
a
percent
higher
after
the
previous
day
s
harsh
session
and
losses
across
asia
earlier
on
wednesday
where
a
key
equity
index
shed
more
than
percent
world
stocks
slipped
percent
heading
for
their
sixth
day
in
the
red
but
european
shares
made
tentative
gains
after
falling
almost
percent
in
the
past
five
days
the
recovery
was
partly
driven
by
news
that
italy
s
two
parties
were
again
renewing
efforts
to
form
a
government
rather
than
force
the
country
back
to
the
polls
for
the
second
time
this
year
another
positive
was
a
smooth
auction
of
italian
debt
that
raised
billion
euros
easing
concerns
about
rome
s
ability
to
finance
itself
the
auction
clearly
indicates
that
investors
still
have
faith
in
the
italian
economy
if
not
the
government
said
seema
shah
global
investment
strategist
at
principal
global
investors
but
she
warned
that
political
uncertainty
would
remain
elevated
japan
s
biggest
private
life
insurance
firm
nippon
life
which
holds
some
trillion
yen
billion
worth
of
euro
zone
bonds
said
it
had
no
plans
for
now
to
buy
or
sell
its
italian
debt
holdings
equities
snapped
a
losing
streak
and
bounced
almost
percent
while
italian
bond
yields
a
sensitive
gauge
of
political
risk
fell
more
than
half
a
percent
from
highs
they
had
suffered
their
worst
day
in
nearly
years
on
tuesday
italian
yields
slipped
bps
the
risk
for
investors
is
that
eurosceptic
political
parties
are
further
boosted
with
any
election
viewed
as
a
de
facto
referendum
on
italy
s
euro
membership
the
events
have
evoked
memories
of
the
euro
debt
crisis
with
potentially
huge
implications
for
the
single
currency
the
risks
had
sent
investors
scurrying
for
safer
german
and
governmment
bonds
as
well
as
currencies
such
as
the
yen
and
swiss
franc
at
the
expense
of
the
euro
that
trend
receded
on
wednesday
with
the
euro
bouncing
almost
one
percent
versus
the
dollar
and
recouping
all
its
tuesday
losses
which
had
taken
it
down
to
lows
it
also
rose
between
percent
and
one
percent
against
the
swiss
franc
and
yen
respectively
the
political
problems
in
italy
heighten
the
risk
of
a
systematic
problem
within
the
euro
zone
and
within
the
euro
zone
financial
system
but
that
is
still
a
risk
rather
than
a
probability
said
laith
khalaf
senior
analyst
at
hargreaves
lansdown
the
improved
mood
encouraged
investors
to
sell
and
german
bonds
reversing
some
of
the
bps
yield
rises
seen
on
tuesday
yields
jumped
more
than
basis
points
to
percent
while
their
german
counterparts
were
up
basis
points
most
investors
remain
cautious
though
with
goldman
sachs
cutting
its
forecast
for
the
euro
s
exchange
rate
against
the
dollar
due
to
italian
political
developments
it
said
it
now
expected
the
euro
to
trade
at
in
months
time
versus
its
previous
prediction
with
brewing
trade
conflicts
world
growth
is
another
concern
the
organisation
for
economic
cooperation
and
development
warned
in
its
latest
report
that
a
trade
war
was
threatening
the
growth
outlook
that
is
likely
to
weigh
especially
hard
on
the
developing
world
emerging
equities
were
down
more
than
one
percent
to
month
lows
while
shanghai
shares
dropped
percent
emerging
markets
are
also
suffering
from
the
dollar
s
surge
since
with
indonesia
raising
interest
rates
for
the
second
time
in
two
weeks
to
support
the
rupiah
currency
italian
politics
mask

underlying
growing
