interview-up on the roof: china's renesola bets on small-scale solar projects
shanghai
reuters
chinese
solar
developer
renesola
is
banking
on
the
growing
appetite
for
small
projects
on
city
rooftops
after
hiving
off
its
struggling
manufacturing
business
last
year
a
senior
executive
told
reuters
the
strategy
underscores
how
many
industry
officials
see
solar
projects
on
roofs
and
in
car
parks
as
the
best
available
option
with
chronic
land
shortages
forcing
conventional
renewable
power
developers
to
take
steps
such
as
building
on
depleted
mining
areas
china
s
solar
sector
has
seen
rapid
growth
with
newly
installed
capacity
reaching
a
record
gigawatts
last
year
but
manufacturers
are
now
coming
under
pressure
from
the
land
constraints
falling
subsidies
and
a
decline
in
project
approvals
there
is
still
a
lot
of
room
for
growth
every
year
there
are
lots
of
new
buildings
and
factories
and
throughout
the
regions
there
are
buildings
that
still
have
no
solar
said
liang
xiaoliang
renesola
s
chief
financial
officer
while
central
government
subsidies
for
smaller
distributed
generation
dg
projects
fell
to
yuan
per
this
year
from
yuan
regions
like
shanghai
and
zhejiang
are
offering
additional
support
to
meet
targets
he
added
china
s
dg
capacity
nearly
tripled
to
gw
last
year
spurred
by
growing
demand
from
building
owners
who
pay
zero
construction
costs
and
receive
discounted
power
renesola
is
targeting
around
mw
of
capacity
in
china
by
and
does
not
plan
to
get
involved
in
plants
there
are
land
issues
grid
interconnection
issues
curtailment
issues
as
well
as
the
postponed
payment
of
subsidies
he
said
adding
that
a
distributed
project
needed
only
two
permits
compared
to
for
a
plant
though
solar
still
struggles
to
compete
with
conventional
energy
sources
some
expect
it
to
achieve
cost
parity
within
just
a
few
years
china
itself
has
cut
solar
costs
by
percent
in
the
last
decade
offsetting
the
subsidy
declines
liang
said
a
project
built
in
xinjiang
in
cost
about
yuan
per
watt
while
some
industry
estimates
now
say
prices
could
fall
to
as
low
as
yuan
by
the
government
is
also
offering
alternative
means
of
support
including
a
scheme
compelling
regions
to
ensure
a
fixed
proportion
of
their
power
comes
from
renewables
renesola
formerly
a
polysilicon
wafer
producer
last
year
transferred
its
manufacturing
assets
and
debts
to
chairman
li
xianshou
in
exchange
for
additional
equity
switching
its
business
model
to
downstream
generation
projects
in
the
process
