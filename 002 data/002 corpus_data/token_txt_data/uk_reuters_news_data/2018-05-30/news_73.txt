brazilian
president
michel
temer
said
on
tuesday
there
was
no
chance
that
a
nationwide
truckers
protest
that
has
paralysed
latin
america
s
biggest
economy
will
spark
a
military
coup
and
topple
his
government
temer
speaking
to
a
small
group
of
foreign
journalists
at
an
investment
forum
in
sao
paulo
batted
down
questions
about
risks
of
a
military
intervention
the
demonstrations
by
truck
drivers
against
diesel
price
hikes
has
emptied
roads
and
left
major
cities
running
short
on
food
gasoline
and
medical
supplies
the
nationwide
protest
has
been
has
been
slow
to
unwind
despite
a
raft
of
concessions
that
temer
offered
over
the
weekend
some
striking
truckers
are
calling
for
a
coup
a
hotly
debated
topic
on
social
media
and
fringe
groups
who
want
the
military
back
in
charge
have
been
a
constant
presence
during
protests
in
recent
years
there
is
zero
chance
of
military
intervention
temer
said
through
a
translator
what
i
see
is
a
rejection
both
in
the
ministry
of
defense
and
throughout
the
military
forces
to
any
kind
of
military
but
polling
shows
that
temer
is
brazil
s
least
popular
president
since
the
country
s
military
junta
ended
he
also
remains
under
investigation
amid
allegations
of
graft
if
brazil
s
prosecutor
general
raquel
dodge
were
to
decide
to
charge
temer
it
would
be
up
to
a
congressional
vote
on
whether
he
would
be
tried
before
the
supreme
court
temer
last
year
fought
off
two
such
corruption
charges
but
with
general
elections
in
october
and
polls
consistently
demonstrating
the
public
s
deep
dissatisfaction
with
political
leaders
across
the
board
it
is
not
clear
that
he
retains
congressional
support
to
survive
any
potential
new
charges
temer
said
in
a
television
interview
that
protests
by
truck
drivers
still
parked
on
motorways
should
be
resolved
by
wednesday
though
his
government
still
has
to
deliver
on
its
pledge
to
cut
the
price
of
diesel
by
real
per
litre
a
bill
approved
by
the
senate
on
tuesday
included
a
tax
exemption
on
diesel
inserted
by
the
lower
house
but
temer
is
expected
to
veto
the
fuel
provision
and
find
a
different
way
to
fund
the
costly
concession
to
truckers
temer
said
hefty
fines
were
being
levied
on
distribution
firms
found
to
be
supporting
the
strike
but
said
he
hoped
tougher
action
would
not
be
necessary
if
the
truckers
moved
vehicles
off
the
roads
earlier
on
tuesday
public
security
minister
raul
jungmann
said
the
government
had
started
taking
tougher
action
against
the
truckers
threatening
to
crack
down
on
alleged
political
agitators
contributing
to
the
crisis
the
more
aggressive
stance
underscored
the
government
s
mounting
urgency
to
end
the
protest
the
highway
blockades
and
fuel
shortages
have
halted
industries
from
automaking
to
sugarcane
crushing
hammering
exports
of
everything
from
beef
and
soybeans
to
coffee
and
cars
brazil

cna
farm

said
producers
have
lost

far
during
the
truckers
protest
cna

that
did
not
take
into
account
losses
for
food
processors
industries
and
makers
of

disruption
to
supplies
of

feed
has
had
a
devastating
impact
on
the
nation

livestock
some
million
chickens
had
been
slaughtered
as
of
monday
because
producers
can
not
feed
them
said

abpa
some
factions
within
the
loosely
organised
truckers
movement
have
added
to
the
demands
and
ignored
a
call
to
demobilize
by
industry
group
abcam
which
says
it
represents
drivers
and
spearheaded
the
early
protests
oil

said
fuel
distribution
had
begun
to
improve
in
cities
such
as
rio
de
janeiro
and
the
capital
brasilia
but
it
remained
scarce
in
several
regions
including
the

hub
of
sao

it
will
take
at
least
a
week
for

to
return
