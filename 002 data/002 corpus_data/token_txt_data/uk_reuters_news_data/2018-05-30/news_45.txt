the
opinions

here
are
those
of
the

a

may

next
month
s
meeting
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
is
being
touted
as
key
to
the
outlook
for
crude
oil
prices
but
a
strong
indication
of
what
s
likely
will
come
next
week
saudi
aramco
the
producer
of
the
world
s
largest
crude
exporter
will
release
its
official
selling
prices
osps
for
cargoes
and
these
in
turn
largely
set
the
prices
for
much
of
the
exports
from
the
middle
east
the
problem
with
meetings
like
the
opec
gathering
on
june
in
vienna
is
that
they
focus
tremendously
on
what
is
said
rather
than
what
is
actually
done
the
osps
on
the
other
hand
show
exactly
what
the
saudis
are
doing
in
the
oil
market
and
in
some
ways
are
a
more
important
signal
the
saudis
have
an
opportunity
with
the
july
osps
likely
to
be
released
next
week
to
show
they
are
serious
about
two
issues
currently
dominating
crude
oil
markets
these
are
concerns
about
the
tightness
of
global
supply
especially
in
light
of
venezuela
s
woes
and
the
possible
curtailment
of
iranian
exports
and
the
rising
importance
of
the
united
states
as
an
exporter
particularly
to
the
major
consuming
region
of
asia
in
recent
months
saudi
aramco
has
been
lifting
its
osps
to
asia
with
the
price
for
its
benchmark
arab
light
grade
being
set
for
june
cargoes
at
a
premium
of
a
barrel
to
the
average
the
highest
since
august
this
increase
was
viewed
by
several
refining
customers
as
unexpectedly
large
with
sinopec
asia
s
largest
refiner
showing
its
displeasure
by
cutting
the
volumes
of
saudi
crude
it
would
lift
in
june
the
second
month
in
a
row
it
decided
against
taking
its
normal
allocation
if
saudi
arabia
is
serious
about
raising
crude
output
and
boosting
supply
one
sure
way
of
signalling
this
would
be
a
sharp
lowering
in
the
osp
for
july
cargoes
with
the
cut
being
bigger
than
what
would
be
justified
by
market
fundamentals
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
and
his
russian
counterpart
alexander
novak
met
last
week
in
petersburg
and
discussed
a
gradual
easing
of
the
output
curbs
opec
and
its
allies
agreed
to
in
november
according
to
sources
this
led
to
crude
prices
stumbling
with
brent
dropping
percent
from
a
barrel
at
the
close
on
may
to
at
the
finish
on
tuesday
the
trick
for
the
saudis
the
rest
of
opec
and
their
russian
allies
is
to
ensure
that
crude
prices
remain
anchored
as
close
to
a
barrel
as
possible
which
seems
to
be
a
level
that
is
a
good
compromise
between
meeting
the
fiscal
needs
of
the
producers
without
being
high
enough
to
prompt
too
much
demand
destruction
the
saudis
also
have
to
balance
the
geopolitics
of
oil
striking
a
balance
between
their
need
for
relatively
high
prices
against
the
support
of
president
donald
trump
in
their
struggle
against
regional
rival
iran
in
some
ways
the
wild
card
for
the
oil
markets
currently
is
the
united
states
which
is
becoming
an
increasingly
important
player
in
asian
markets
record
crude
shipments
to
asia
are
expected
in
the
coming
months
with
a
senior
executive
at
a
oil
company
estimating
that
the
country
will
ship
some
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
june
of
which
million
bpd
will
head
to
asia
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
oil
research
and
forecasts
show
that
about
bpd
of
crude
headed
to
asia
in
the
first
five
months
of
up
from
just
bpd
in
the
same
period
last
year
however
if
crude
exports
to
asia
do
surge
to
more
than
million
bpd
in
coming
months
this
could
provide
the
saudis
and
the
russians
with
an
added
incentive
to
make
more
oil
available
to
the
market
and
at
a
more
competitive
price
again
there
is
a
geopolitical
angle
with
china
the
world
s
biggest
crude
importer
under
political
pressure
by
president
trump
pressure
to
buy
more
from
the
united
states
in
order
to
lower
the
trade
deficit
with
china
at
the
same
time
the
chinese
have
made
their
unhappiness
with
the
recent
saudi
price
increases
quite
clear
meaning
they
would
most
likely
want
to
see
a
substantial
reduction
before
boosting
their
volumes
from
the
kingdom
