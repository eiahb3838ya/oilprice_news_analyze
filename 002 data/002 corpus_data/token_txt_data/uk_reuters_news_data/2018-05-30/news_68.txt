hedge
fund
managers
were
busy
reducing
bullish
positions
in
petroleum
well
before
opec
and
its
allies
indicated
in
the
middle
of
last
week
that
they
would
consider
relaxing
output
curbs
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
reduced
their
net
long
position
in
the
six
major
petroleum
futures
and
options
contracts
in
each
of
the
five
weeks
to
may
by
a
total
of
million
barrels
the
reduction
has
been
concentrated
in
crude
where
net
long
positions
in
brent
and
wti
were
cut
by
million
barrels
over
those
five
weeks

was
heaviest

million

liquidation
hit
brent
futures
prices
particularly
hard
since
most
hedge
fund
positions
are
held
in
contracts
just
a
few
months
from
expiry
which
has
helped
push
contract
prices
into
contango
portfolio
managers
cut
their
net
long
position
in
brent
by
almost
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
may
the
largest
reduction
since
before
the
rally
started
in
june
hedge
funds
have
continued
to
add
bullish
positions
in
fuels
especially
gasoline
in
a
bet
consumption
will
remain
relatively
strong
but
the
decision
to
pare
positions
in
crude
points
to
deeper
unease
about
the
sustainability
of
the
rally
in
oil
prices
over
the
last
months
hedge
funds
started
to
reduce
their
net
long
position
in
petroleum
around
the
time
president
donald
trump
used
twitter
on
april
to
blame
opec
for
pushing
up
oil
prices
for
all
the
bullish
commentary
around
oil
prices
in
recent
weeks
hedge
fund
managers
have
used
rising
prices
to
realise
some
profits
rather
than
increase
their
positions
hedge
fund
positioning
in
the
petroleum
complex
had
become
exceptionally
stretched
with
long
positions
outnumbering
short
ones
by
a
record
ratio
of
by
april
positioning
was
even
more
lopsided
in
brent
where
portfolio
managers
held
more
than
long
positions
for
every
short
one
according
to
exchange
and
regulatory
data
since
then
however
fund
managers
have
cut
long
positions
across
the
petroleum
complex
by
million
barrels
and
boosted
shorts
by
million
barrels
the
number
of
shorts
has
risen
from
just
million
barrels
to
million
barrels
the
highest
for
five
months
since
the
middle
of
december
positioning
is
still
stretched
but
much
less
so
than
before
with
long
positions
now
outnumbering
shorts
by
in
petroleum
and
in
brent
large
concentrations
of
hedge
fund
positions
have
normally
preceded
a
sharp
reversal
in
the
price
trend
over
the
last
four
years
recent
sharp
falls
in
oil
prices
especially
brent
are
therefore
not
surprising
given
that
fund
managers
have
been
steadily
liquidating
long
positions
and
adding
shorts
for
more
than
a
month
comments
from
senior
opec
and
officials
suggesting
they
would
consider
raising
output
to
compensate
for
lost
production
from
venezuela
and

on

catalysed
a
sharp
fall
in
oil
prices
but

had
been
primed
for
a
sharp
correction
