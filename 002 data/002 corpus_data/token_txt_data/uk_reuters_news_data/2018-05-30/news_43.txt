iranian
oil

cut

have
a
period
during
which

said
the

was
exiting
a
international
nuclear

exports
are
down
by
more
than
barrels
per

the
very
high
levels
seen
in
april
but
there
is
no
sign
of
a
mass
exodus
at
this

daniel

reuters
supply
and
demand
in
large
parts
of
the
oil

is
opaque

among
a
number
of

iran

exported
million

dropped
since

around
million
bpd

the
bulk
of
iran
s
crude
exports
at
least
million
bpd
goes
to
asia
most
of
the
rest
goes
to
europe
and
these
volumes
are
seen
by
analysts
and
traders
as
the
more
vulnerable
to
being
curbed
by
sanctions
said
the
overall
rate
of
iran
s
exports
remained
strong
in
may
compared
with
recent
months
and
companies
in
europe
were
still
buying
in

may
exports
remain
significantly
higher
than
the
previous
average
with
european
refiners
continuing

throughout
the
month
gerber
said
iran
s
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
on
may
tehran
s
oil
exports
would
not
change
if
the
eu
could
salvage
the
nuclear
pact
as
it
is
trying
to
do
but
trading
sources
expect
financing
issues
to
hinder
iranian
oil
trade
as
banks
grow
wary
