italy
s
political
crisis
and
renewed
trade
war
fears
sent
world
stocks
lower
for
the
sixth
day
in
a
row
though
hopes
that
italy
could
avoid
a
new
election
helped
european
markets
stage
a
from
one
of
their
worst
selloffs
in
years
investors
have
in
recent
days
scurried
for
assets
such
as
and
german
bonds
or
the
japanese
yen
spooked
by
the
possibility
that
italy
the
euro
zone
economy
could
deliver
a
bigger
boost
to
eurosceptic
parties
in
a
snap
election
that
sources
said
could
be
held
by
an
election
at
this
point
would
also
be
a
de
facto
referendum
on
italy
s
euro
membership
evoking
memories
of
the
euro
debt
crisis
and
carrying
huge
implications
for
the
single
currency
whatever
its
outcome
however
reports
that
the
two
parties
were
again
renewing
efforts
to
form
a
government
rather
than
force
the
country
back
to
the
polls
helped
equities
snap
a
losing
streak
similarly
italian
bond
yields
a
sensitive
gauge
of
political
risk
fell
almost
half
a
percent
from
highs
after
suffering
their
worst
day
in
nearly
years
on
tuesday
a
equity
index
was
flat
on
the
day
after
falling
almost
percent
in
the
past
five
days
barclays
investment
strategist
hao
ran
wee
said
that
while
risks
from
italy
for
world
markets
had
certainly
risen
there
were
significant
hurdles
for
the
country
to
sharply
increase
spending
or
exit
the
euro
zone
it
s
questionable
how
credible
italy
s
threat
of
leaving
the
eu
actually
is
if
push
comes
to
shove
as
a
result
we
think
the
repeat
of
a
euro
crisis
remains
a
small
possibility
wee
said
adding
he
remained
optimistic
on
euro
zone
economic
growth
and
regional
equity
markets
japan

biggest
private

after
tuesday
s
harsh
session
which
saw
all
three
indexes
lose

percent
led
by
financial

stocks
asian
markets
however
remained
under
pressure
with
an
index
of
asian

hurt
also
by
news
that
the
united
states
was
pressing
ahead
with
tariffs
and
restrictions
on

by
chinese
companies
beijing
meanwhile
said
it
was
ready
to
fight

if
washington

a
trade
war
japan

nikkei
sold
off
percent
to
a
low
while
shanghai

also
dropped

emerging

overall
this
move
puts
a
trade

scenario
back
on
the
agenda
rabobank
analysts
told
clients
emerging
markets
are
also
suffering
from
the
dollar
s
renewed
surge
since
with
indonesia
raising
interest
rates
for
the
second
time
in
two
weeks
to
support
the
rupiah
currency
the
politics
and
fears
of
an
economic
hit
across
the
euro
zone
has
driven
investors
into
treasuries
and
german
bunds
pushing

lower
they
have
also
fuelled
a
sharp
rise
in
the
yen
and
swiss
franc
especially
against
the
euro
the

attempted
to
bounce
off
lows
against
the
dollar
rising
percent
to
while
against
the
swiss
franc
and

it
firmed
around

the
risk
to
the
euro
is
predominantly
political
in
the
near
term
alvin
tan
a

strategist
at
societe

said
adding
the
euro
would
likely
stay
capped
at
or
until
the

was
resolved
treasury
