reuters
global
stocks
staged
a
recovery
on
wednesday
buoyed
by
optimism
that
italy
may
avoid
a
potentially
damaging
general
election
msci
s
gauge
of
stocks
across
the
globe
gained
percent
lifted
by
a
rebound
in
both
europe
and
the
united
states
the
recovery
was
partly
driven
by
news
that
italy
s
two
parties
were
renewing
efforts
to
form
a
government
rather
than
force
the
country
to
the
polls
for
the
second
time
this
year
the
prospect
that
no
government
would
be
formed
leading
to
elections
that
could
be
a
referendum
on
italy
s
euro
membership
had
sent
italian
bond
yields
up
by
the
most
in
nearly
years
yet
investors
were
in
a
buying
mood
on
wednesday
the
dow

the
political
problems
in
italy
heighten
the
risk
of
a
systematic
problem
within
the
euro
zone
and
within
the
euro
zone
financial
system
but
that
is
still
a
risk
rather
than
a
probability
said
laith
khalaf
senior
analyst
at
hargreaves
lansdown
another
positive
was
a
smooth
auction
of
italian
debt
that
raised
billion
euros
easing
concerns
about
rome
s
ability
to
finance
itself
japan
s

private
life
insurance
firm
nippon
life
which
holds
some
trillion
yen

worth
of

bonds
said
it
had
no
plans
for
now
to
buy

sell
its
italian
debt
holdings

streak
and

while
italian

yields
a
sensitive
gauge
of
political
risk
fell
more
than
a

from
highs
jason
browne
chief
investment
strategist
at
fundx
investment
group
llc
said
investors
were
on
the
look
out
for
news
such
as
the
italian
volatility
that
could
point
to
an
end
to
a
bull
market
led
by
large
tech
stocks
but
betting
against
the
market
usually
ended
up
painfully
the
bigger
picture
over
the
last
eight
years
has
really
been
growth
dominated
and
i
think
everybody
s
always
looking
for
a
change
he
said
then
we
get
some
news
that
comes
out
and
we
start
to
see
evidence
of
that
change
but
each
and
every
time
those
have
tended
to
be
a
bit
of
a
pain
browne
said
he
expects
volatility
to
continue
the
italian
election
risk
had
also
sent
investors
scurrying
for
safer
german
and
government
bonds
as
well
as
currencies
such
as
the
yen
and
swiss
franc
at
the
expense
of
the
euro
that
trend
receded
on
wednesday
with
the
euro
bouncing
nearly
one
percent
versus
the
dollar
and
recouping
all
its
tuesday
losses
which
had
taken
it
down
to
lows
it
also
rose
against
the
swiss
franc
and
yen
bonds
lost
some
of
their
appeal

economic

initially
thought
with

annual

in
