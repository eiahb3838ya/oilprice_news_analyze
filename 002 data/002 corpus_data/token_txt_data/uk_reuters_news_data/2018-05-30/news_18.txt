countries
will
be
directed

bulgaria
bulgarian
prime
minister
boyko
borissov
announced
on
wednesday
after
talks
with
russian
president
vladimir
putin
the
gas
pipeline
is
part
of
the
kremlin
s
plans
to
bypass
ukraine
currently
the
main
transit
route
for
russian
gas
to
europe
and
strengthen
its
foothold
on
european
gas
markets
the
proposed
second
line
of
the
existing
nord
stream
pipeline
via
the
baltic
sea
is
also
part
of
these
efforts
which
would
deprive
ukraine
of
most
of
its
transit
revenues
russian
gas
giant
gazprom
which
supplies
around
percent
of
the
european
gas
market
built
the
first
line
of
the
turkstream
pipeline
to
turkey
for
local
gas
consumption
the
second
fork
of
turkstream
will
reach
bulgaria
and
through
it
russian
gas
will
come
from
russia
borissov
said
on
his
facebook
page
ending
speculation
that
the
pipeline
might
have
headed
to
greece
i
am
thankful
that
we
are
returning
to
the
gas
distribution
role
that
we
had
in
the
balkans
he
said
the
two
lines
of
turkstream
will
each
have
an
annual
capacity
of
billion
cubic
metres
gazprom
has
completed
the
first
line
of
turkstream
and
putin
said
about
half
of
the
second
line
had
been
built
bulgaria
would
like
a
portion
of
the
gas
to
go
to
its
gas
hub
project
at
the
black
sea
port
of
varna
borissov
said
sofia
s
plans
for
the
hub
are
backed
by
the
european
commission
they
followed
the
cancellation
in
of
gazprom
s
south
stream
gas
pipeline
project
which
would
have
shipped
russian
gas
under
the
black
sea
via
bulgaria
to
central
europe
gas
will
be
used
through
the
gas
hub
in
varna
the
market
and
demand
will
define
the
quantities
and
prices
our
aim
is
to
be
on
the
map
for
gas
distribution
