midamerican
energy
co
will
become
the
first
utility
to
source
percent
of
its
customers
electricity
needs
from
renewable
energy
when
it
completes
a
million
wind
farm
in
the
company
said
on
wednesday
the
utility
owned
by
warren
buffett
s
berkshire
hathaway
inc
began
investing
in
wind
power
about
years
ago
to
both
hedge
against
volatile
fuel
prices
and
generate
more
power
its
chief
executive
said
adding
that
federal
tax
credits
for
renewable
projects
have
kept
costs
low
we
have
not
had
to
raise
customers
rates
and
that
s
a
big
part
of
the
way
we
evaluate
these
projects
midamerican
ceo
adam
wright
said
in
an
interview
we
re
not
building
wind
just
for
the
sake
of
building
the
company
based
in
des
moines
iowa
serves
electric
customers
with
the
completion
of
the
utility
s
twelfth
wind
project
midamerican
will
generate
enough
renewable
energy
to
equal
the
amount
consumed
by
customers
in
its
iowa
service
territory
because
of
the
intermittency
of
electricity
generated
by
wind
the
utility
will
continue
to
use
its
existing
natural
gas
nuclear
and
power
plants
midamerican
said
adding
that
it
is
seeking
sites
to
add
more
wind
farms
wind
power
accounts
for
more
than
percent
of
the
electricity
generated
in
iowa
more
than
any
other
state
midamerican
s
wind
xii
project
is
subject
to
approval
by
the
iowa
