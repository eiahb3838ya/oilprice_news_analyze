on

to
evoke
emergency
powers
to
help
it
keep
several
struggling
nuclear
and
power
plants
open
a
move
critics
described

to
negotiate
a

nuclear
plants

providing
reliable
power
and
jobs
coal

have
struggled
in

years
because
of
low

prices
delivered
by
the
shale
boom

represents
our
best
path
forward
as
we
continue

restructuring
asset
sales
and
legislative
and
regulatory
relief
