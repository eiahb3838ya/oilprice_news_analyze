sanctions
on
iranian
oil
begin
on
and
washington
has
said
it
wants
to
stop
all
of
tehran
s
fuel
exports
we
have
to
continue
to
monitor
the
market
in
the
next
two
to
three
months
falih
said
we
will
decide
if
there
are
any
disruptions
from
supply
especially
with
the
iran
sanctions
looming
then
we
will
continue
with
the
mindset
we
have
now
which
is
to
meet
any
demand
that
materialises
to
ensure
customers
are
oil
prices
have

a
timeline
for
this
the
minister
also
said
that
if
oil
supply
continues
to
build
up
we
will
have
the
mechanism
to
reconvene
and
bring
supply
and
demand
in
balance
and
to
prevent
inventories
from
growing
it
is
a
very
unpredictable
situation
from
supply
in
particular
but
demand
also
has
its
uncertainties
with
the
trade
frictions

said
he
said
the

hoped
to
extend
their
cooperation
on

when

meet
in

in

it
will
become
an
agreement
to
continue
to
