the
rapid
consumption
of
raw
materials
must
be
curbed
to
cut
waste
and
carbon
emissions
the
united
nations
and
global
have
urged
with
resource
consumption
set
to
almost
double
by
especially
in
developing
economies
in
the
century
the
world
mined
times
more
construction
materials
than
ever
before
the
international
resource
panel
irp
and
the
environment
programme
unep
said
in
a
report
on
tuesday
we
are
using
the
planet
s
resources
at
a
faster
rate
than
they
can
be
replenished
while
polluting
our
seas
air
and
countryside
with
the
waste
from
our
consumption
habits
head

erik
solheim
said
in
a
statement
governments
cities
and
companies
have
been
under
increased
pressure
in
recent
years
to
cut
down
on
waste
including
plastic
and
to
reach
ambitious
climate
goals
in
countries
signing
the
paris
agreement
to
curb
global
warming
set
a
goal
of
limiting
a
rise
in
average
world
surface
temperatures
to
well
below
above
times
while
pursuing
efforts
to
limit
rising
temperatures
to
yet
with
of
people
set
to
be
living
in
cities
by
according
to
estimates
the
use
of
raw
materials
is
predicted
to
nearly
double
by
the
huge
appetite
for
metals
sand
coal
and
other
natural
materials
will
see
consumption
of
natural
resources
rise
to
gigatonnes
in
from
gigatonnes
today
the
organization
for
economic
and
development
oecd
said
on
monday
a
booming
construction
sector
in
economies
like
india
has
lead
to
a
surge
in
illegal
where
poor
labourers
risk
all
by
diving
into
rivers
to
extract
sand
the
emissions
released
by
the
extraction
and
use
of
these
materials
will
also
nearly
double
to
gigatonnes
by
from
gigatonnes
today
the
oecd
added
but
under
a
circular
economy
model
reusing
these
raw
materials
or
repairing
industrial
products
like
heavy
machinery
or
car
parts
would
drastically
cut
down
on
waste
and
slash
carbon
emissions
by
up
to
per
cent
in
some
sectors
according
the
irp
and
unep
report
it
would
also
boost
green
jobs
and
technology
and
reduce
the
need
to
extract
raw
materials
the
report
added
currently
accounts
for
about
per
cent
of
production
across
the
and
europe
the
report
said
the
traditional
manufacturing
model
where
we
make
use
and
then
dispose
of
a
product
is
both
wasteful
and
polluting
environment
s
solheim
said
in
the
report
released
at
the
world
circular
economy
forum
in
japan
if
we
this
and
move
towards
a
more
circular
model
where
a
product
is
used
and
then
we
retain
the
value
of
the
materials
and
resources
used
to
make
that
product
