world
shares
slid
towards
their
lowest
level
in
a
year
on
tuesday
as
negative
drivers
from
fatigued
earnings
and
saudi
arabia
s
diplomatic
isolation
to
a
brewing
spat
over
italy
s
finances
piled
on
the
pressure
wall
street
looked
set
to
for
another
jolt
lower
when
it
reopens
but
it
was
heavy
selloffs
in
both
asia
and
europe
which
was
heading
for
a
fifth
day
of
uninterrupted
falls
that
did
the
main
damage
the
tech
sector
posted
the
worst
performance
after
chipmaker
ams
plunged
percent
as
its
outlook
triggered
alarm
bells
but
there
was
a
broader
force
at
play
the

near
a

with
almost
half
of

now
in

down
percent
from

germany

msci

of

while
wall
street
s
s
p
was
set
to
test
the
lower
limits
of
its
moving
average
again
this
is
quite
an
important
period
now
because
we
have
tried
to
rally
a
few
times
and
haven
t
really
managed
it
said
natwest
markets
head
of
global
strategy
james
mccormick
there
has
been
a
spike
in
bond
yields
similar
to
earlier
in
the
year
but
the
macro
picture
for
equities
is
more
challenging
now
he
added
pointing
to
fading
synchronization
in
global
growth
as
well
a
stronger
dollar
that
strength
kept
the
euro
pinned
near
a
low
at
at
before
a
european
commission
meeting
that

see
brussels
take
the
unprecedented
step
of

plans
italian
bond
traders
were
biding
their
time
amid
reports
of
some
conciliatory
moves
from
rome
s
coalition
but
the
spat
has
also
bred
doubts
about
the
european

just
a
enough

help
sterling
claw
higher
but
the
mood
remained
distinctly
risk
off
regardless
that
helped
strengthen
the
japanese
yen
and
swiss
franc
while
currencies
like
the
australian
and
new

dollars
fell
the
prospect
of
a
normalisation
of
ecb
monetary
policy
was
the
main
reason
why
the
euro
was
able
to
appreciate
over
the
past
year
however
there
is
a
rising
risk
that
this
support
is
now
going
to
crumble
