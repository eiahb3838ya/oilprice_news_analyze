in
rotterdam
ships
from
around
the
world
cruise
in
and
out
of
europe
s
busiest
port
a
bustling
industrial
hub
that
employs
almost
people
and
produces
percent
of
the
netherlands
gases
as
rotterdam
tries
to
cut
its
emissions
in
line
with
global
goals
to
curb
global
warming
shipping
emissions
are
a
particular
challenge
not
least
because
many
fall
outside
the
targets
set
by
the
paris
agreement
to
curb
climate
change
but
the
city
s
bustling
port
is
starting
to
take
them
on
it
has
introduced
financial
incentives
for
ships
and
other
port
facilities
to
invest
in
renewable
power
with
the
aim
of
slashing
the
port
s
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
shipping
and
industry
by
percent
by
by
emissions
would
fall
percent
in
line
with
national
targets
according
to
the
plan
the
goals
fit
alongside
new
efforts
by
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
the
united
nations
body
that
regulates
shipping
to
cut
shipping
emissions
which
were
not
part
of
the
paris
agreement
the
imo
in
april
under
pressure
from
island
states
for
the
first
time
set
a
target
of
slashing
emissions
by
at
least
percent
by
compared
to
such
efforts
will
have
implications
beyond
rotterdam
with
percent
of
global
goods
transported
by
ship
and
international
shipping
responsible
for
percent
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
the
same
total
as
germany
according
to
the
imo
every
sector
needs
to
do
its
bit
to
contribute
to
the
fight
against
climate
change
natasha
brown
a
spokeswoman
for
the
imo
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
rotterdam
is
one
of
more
than
cities
from
seoul
to
medellin
that
have
pledged
to
buy
only
buses
by
and
take
other
steps
to
make
major
areas
of
their
city
zero
emission
zones
by
each
is
going
about
achieving
the
goal
in
its
own
way
but
because
cities
account
for
about
of
carbon
dioxide
emissions
according
to
the
and
consume
more
than
of
the
world
s
energy
whether
they
succeed
or
fail
will
have
a
huge
impact
on
whether
the
world
s
climate
goals
are
met
in
rotterdam
greening
port
facilities
that
are
heavily
reliant
on
fossil
fuels
and
home
to
five
large
oil
refineries
is
a
first
big
task
doing
nothing
is
not
an
option
said
caroline
kroes
programme
lead
of
the
energy
transition
strategy
at
the
port
but
making
port
facilities
greener
must
be
combined
with
efforts
to
cut
global
shipping
emissions
she
said
the
paris
agreement
is
not
possible
if
anyone
stays
behind
everyone
will
have
to
move
and
change
kroes
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
at
her
office
in
rotterdam
in
a
bid
to
encourage
cleaner
shipping
the
port
has
introduced
financial
incentives
for
or
vessels
including
an
environmental
ship
index
which
began
measuring
the
emissions
of
individual
ships
last
year
since
july
all
ships
that
dock
at
rotterdam
port
have
received
a
score
out
of
based
on
how
much
nitrogen
oxide
and
sulphur
oxide
they
emit
and
carbon
dioxide
was
added
to
the
mix
this
year
using
the
index
the
port
offers
discounts
on
port
costs
to
the
cleanest
ships
making
ships
and
port
processes
more
efficient
also
is
key
to
slashing
emissions
kroes
said
improving
efficiency
means
you
need
less
fuel
so
you
save
costs
and
reduce
emissions
at
the
same
time
she
said
one
way
that
is
happening
is
by
better
coordinating
ship
arrivals
and
departures
to
cut
waiting
time
this
year
the
port
launched
pronto
a
digital
platform
where
shipping
companies
and
service
providers
can
exchange
information
about
their
port
visits
that
information
exchange
alone
is
expected
to
reduce
waiting
times
for
ships
and
cut
emissions
by
up
to
percent
according
to
leon
willems
a
port
spokesman
if
ships
on
average
spent
hours
less
in
harbour
emissions
from
their
visits
would
fall
by
percent
according
to
a
study
released
this
month
by
the
port
of
rotterdam
authority
fully
electric
sea
ships
are
not
yet
on
the
horizon
in
the
netherlands
as
they
are
still
costly
to
make
and
infrastructure
to
service
them
on
shore
is
not
yet
in
place
kroes
said
but
vessels
that
operate
on
rivers
and
other
inland
water
bodies
in
the
netherlands
are
moving
in
that
direction
this
year
the
port
of
rotterdam
formed
a
partnership
with
skoon
energy
a
dutch
startup
that
helps
existing
ships
switch
from
fossil
fuel
engines
to
electric
propulsion
the
startup
builds
rechargeable
battery
packs
known
as
skoonboxes
that
can
be
fitted
on
combined
vessels
the
port
is
helping
the
company
establish
a
network
of
charging
hubs
for
the
swappable
batteries
more
and
more
companies
are
investing
in
ships
with
both
electric
engines
and
diesel
generators
in
order
to
cut
their
costs
and
their
emissions
skoon
energy
founder
peter
paul
van
voorst
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
we
see
people
switching
to
hybrid
vessels
for
various
reasons
efficiency
reliable
quality
of
the
fuel
and
sustainability
it
is
a
to
have
a
clean
ship
it
s
a
better
business
case
van
voorst
said
in
a
telephone
interview
among
those
making
the
switch
is
dutch
company
damen
shipyards
group
which
is
trying
out
the
skoonboxes
over
the
next
few
months
aboard
the
borelli
a
vessel
that
transports
containers
between
the
ports
of
rotterdam
and
hengelo
a
city
in
the
eastern
netherlands
the
skoonbox
accompanied
with
a
network
of
charging
hubs
will
allow
for
full
electric
sailing
it
is
one
of
many
ways
to
shift
the
shipping
industry
towards
clean
solutions
said
solco
reijnders
programme
manager
for
innovation
at
damen
shipyards
he
said
he
would
not
be
surprised
that
in
years
much
of
the
shipping
industry
has
shifted
to
completely
operations
reaching
the
international
maritime
organization
s
targets
to
cut
shipping
emissions
will
be
costly
and
take
investment
from
both
governments
and
private
experts
said
building
onshore
infrastructure
is
definitely
the
government
s
responsibility
ports
are
not
going
to
build
this
as
it
is
incredibly
expensive
said
johan
de
jong
international
relations
manager
at
the
maritime
research
institute
netherlands
a
bit
of
help
may
be
on
the
way
in
the
dutch
government
allocated
million
euros
million
for
innovative
shipping
projects
and
in
it
is
expected
to
unveil
a
new
green
deal
to
promote
sustainable
shipping
but
more
economically
viable
solutions
are
needed
to
encourage
ship
owners
and
operators
to
adopt
or
practices
van
voorst
said
it
is
up
to
the
renewable
energy
side
to
become
a
cheaper
alternative
he
said
that
is
what
it
eventually
comes
down
to
is
it
cheaper
to
go
clean
or
go
dirty
