turkey
warned
greece
on
tuesday
it
would
not
tolerate
a
shift
in
greece

maritime
border
drawing
a
sharp
rebuke
from
athens
that
it
would
decide
when
and
how
it
exercises
its
sovereign
rights
the
statements
from
both
sides
came
a
few
days
after
greece
s
former
foreign
minister
said
greece
planned
to
extend
its
territorial
waters
to
miles
to
the
west
of
the
country
territorial
waters
are
a
sensitive
issue
between
the
two
neighbours
and
nato
allies
who
are
separated
by
the
aegean
sea
and
have
been
at
odds
over
airspace
ethnically
split
cyprus
and
offshore
mineral
rights
for
decades
turkey
has
previously
warned
it
could
not
preclude
military
action
to
defend
its
interests
former
greek
foreign
minister
nikos
kotzias
who

saturday
that
athens
planned
to
extend
its
territorial
waters
in
the
ionian
sea
which
flanks
the
west
coast
of
the
country
the
planned
measure
would
not
affect
the
aegean
region
off
greece
s
eastern
and
southern
coasts
turkey
s
foreign
ministry
however
said
that
it
had
noted
previous
statements
from
athens
of
plans
for
the
gradual
expansion
of
greek
territorial
waters
it
is
not
possible
to
tolerate
steps
where
there
is
no
bilateral
agreement
on
the
aegean
where
the
two
countries
have
mutual
shores

a
foreign
ministry
spokesman
said
greece
s
rights
would
not
be
dictated
by
third
parties
the
extension
of
the
coastal
zone
is
a
legal
and
inalienable
sovereign
right
of
greece
in
accordance
with
international
law
he
said
the
relevant
decision
for
an
extension
is
exclusively
up
to
greece
which
has
the
right
to
extend
its
territorial
waters
whenever
and
as
it
sees
turkey
s
statement
recalled
a
declaration
of
the
turkeish
parliament
which
had
authorised
action
not
excluding
military
action
to
safeguard
turkish
interests
parliament
s
declaration
dated
june
has
the
necessary
political
warning
in
this
context
and
it
still
maintains
its
validity
today
the
turkish
statement
added
that
view
had
been
conveyed
