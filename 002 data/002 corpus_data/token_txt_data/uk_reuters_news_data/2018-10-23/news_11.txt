iowa lawmaker urges epa to speed up rule expanding ethanol sales
washington
reuters
republican
senator
chuck
grassley
said
on
tuesday
that
the
environmental
protection
agency
must
act
quickly
to
allow
sales
of
higher
ethanol
gasoline
blends
if
president
donald
trump
aims
to
keep
a
campaign
promise
to
corn
farmers
trump
announced
during
a
trip
to
iowa
this
month
his
intention
to
lift
the
summertime
ban
on
sales
of
gasoline
to
help
corn
growers
stung
by
slumping
prices
the
epa
has
since
said
it
will
finish
deliberations
on
a
proposal
to
lift
the
ban
by
may
a
timeline
the
administration
hopes
will
put
the
rule
in
place
before
summer
but
grassley
said
that
was
too
slow
epa
ought
to
speed
it
up
otherwise
it
is
going
to
look
like
the
president
wasn
t
serious
in
his
announcement
he
told
a
weekly
conference
call
we
don
t
need
a
lot
of
bureaucratic
red
tape
with
something
that
has
been
discussed
in
washington
for
four
to
five
years
and
discussed
specifically
with
epa
and
with
the
president
for
about
a
year
he
said
trump
s
announcement
encouraged
farmers
eager
to
expand
the
market
for
ethanol
and
was
seen
as
a
political
victory
for
trump
ahead
of
congressional
elections
in
november
the
epa
s
ban
on
summer
sales
was
initially
intended
to
reduce
smog
but
academic
studies
have
concluded
that
the
ban
is
ineffective
at
improving
air
quality
trump
s
move
however
is
likely
to
face
pushback
from
the
oil
industry
which
has
long
opposed
the
rule
change
since
it
would
cut
into
its
share
of
the
petroleum
market
the
industry
has
threatened
to
sue
over
the
issue
some
industry
experts
say
the
administration
will
ultimately
need
an
act
of
the
congress
to
change
the
rule
epa
acting
chief
andrew
wheeler
however
rejected
that
idea
earlier
this
month
saying
the
agency
has
the
authority
to
move
ahead
alone
