saudi
arabia
s
killing
of
a
journalist
and
the
ramping
up
of
sanctions
against
iran
have
added
a
layer
of
uncertainty
to
crude
oil
markets
creating
a
dilemma
as
to
whether
these
events
are
real
price
drivers
or
just
temporary
noise
the
death
of
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
the
kingdom
s
consulate
in
istanbul
has
generated
a
constant
stream
of
headlines
often
with
contradictory
messages
for
the
outlook
for
oil
supply
and
prices
examples
included
a
veiled
saudi
threat
to
restrict
its
oil
production
in
response
to
any
sanctions
over
the
killing
and
a
suggestion
that
president
donald
trump
is
khashoggi
s
death
to
support
his
saudi
allies
and
increase
his
leverage
over
them
to
boost
the
kingdom
s
crude
output
while
it
is
the
job
of
the
media
to
pursue
the
story
and
all
related
angles
the
twists
and
turns
of
the
tale
ultimately
do
little
to
illuminate
the
likely
path
of
the
crude
oil
market
oil
analysts
are
often
reluctant
to
partake
in
political
discussions
preferring
the
relative
safety
of
supply
and
demand
fundamentals
trusting
that
these
will
eventually
overcome
what
they
hope
are
temporary
influences
but
perhaps
the
better
approach
would
be
to
stand
back
and
try
to
dispassionately
look
at
the
likely
reasonable
outcomes
of
the
killing
of
khashoggi
the
death
according
to
the
available
details
seems
either
premeditated
murder
or
the
result
of
incompetence
that
resulted
in
khashoggi
being
killed
either
way
the
likely
result
is
condemnation
and
action
by
western
countries
and
a
trial
of
sorts
of
the
perpetrators
all
against
the
backdrop
of
trying
to
avoid
placing
blame
on
saudi
arabia
s
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
what
does
this
mean
for
the
oil
market
most
likely
very
little
beyond
what
is
already
happening
the
saudis
will
continue
to
try
and
increase
production
and
meet
the
demand
needs
of
consuming
countries
that
are
being
forced
to
cut
back
their
purchases
of
iranian
crude
and
while
the
khashoggi
killing
may
generate
anger
at
the
brazen
saudi
attempt
and
raise
concerns
about
the
consequences
of
trump
s
continual
characterisation
of
the
media
as
the
enemy
of
the
people
it
s
likely
that
for
oil
the
outcome
will
be
business
as
usual
the
likelihood
that
saudi
arabia
will
try
to
increase
its
oil
output
however
doesn
t
answer
the
question
of
whether
this
will
be
enough
to
offset
the
loss
of
iranian
barrels
sanctions
against
iran
ratchet
up
early
next
month
and
the
trump
administration
s
stated
goal
is
to
reduce
the
islamic
republic
s
exports
to
zero
nobody
believes
this
is
likely
the
issue
though
is
how
much
less
oil
iran
will
supply
to
the
world
market
and
can
this
be
made
up
elsewhere
tracking
iran
s
exports
has
become
more
challenging
in
recent
weeks
as
the
country
s
oil
tankers
have
taken
to
switching
off
their
tracking
monitors
it
does
seem
likely
that
iran
s
exports
are
around
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
which
is
about
to
bpd
below
potential
it
also
seems
clear
that
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
of
which
saudi
arabia
is
the
largest
producer
has
so
far
been
unable
to
make
up
for
the
reduction
in
iranian
supplies
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
opec
and
its
allies
including
russia
would
pump
roughly
an
extra
million
bpd
following
an
agreement
in
june
to
raise
supplies
to
offset
any
losses
caused
by
sanctions
on
iran
an
internal
document
prepared
by
opec
s
vienna
headquarters
for
a
technical
panel
meeting
on
friday
showed
however
that
opec
members
excluding
nigeria
libya
and
congo
pumped
only
an
extra
bpd
in
september
compared
to
may
this
suggests
the
market
may
well
be
short
of
oil
if
sanctions
force
more
buyers
to
avoid
iranian
crude
once
again
politics
is
playing
a
part
in
this
process
with
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
giving
seemingly
contradictory
statements
in
an
interview
with
reuters
in
jerusalem
on
mnuchin
said
it
would
be
harder
for
buyers
to
obtain
waivers
to
continue
buying
iranian
crude
than
it
was
under
sanctions
put
in
place
during
the
administration
of
president
barrack
obama
but
he
also
said
the
loss
of
iranian
cargoes
was
already
priced
into
the
market
and
he
didn
t
expect
oil
costs
to
rise
in
the
wake
of
next
month
s
sanctions
if
though
iranian
crude
supplies
are
severely
curtailed
it
s
likely
mnuchin
will
discover
that
the
market
is
currently
only
priced
for
the
current
reduction
in
tehran
s
oil
shipments
relying
on
a
boost
in
oil
output
from
other
places
such
as
shales
ignores
differences
in
crude
qualities
and
won
t
necessarily
help
ease
the
loss
of
iranian
medium
to
heavy
sour
grades
overall
as
disturbing
as
the
killing
of
khashoggi
is
the
impact
on
the
oil
market
will
likely
be
muted
as
it
isn
t
in
the
interest
of
anyone
to
provoke
a
disruption
meanwhile
the
impact
of
renewed
sanctions
on
tehran
has
yet
to
be
quantified
and
may
come
down
to
a
who
blinks
first
scenario
as
successfully
restrictions
on
the
trade
of
iranian
barrels
would
likely
increase
prices
and
cause
pain
to
the
united
states
and
its
allies
