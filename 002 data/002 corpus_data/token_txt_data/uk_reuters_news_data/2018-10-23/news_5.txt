mexico
s
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
on
tuesday
criticized
pemex
s
plan
to
import
light
crude
from
refiner
phillips
calling
it
a
sign
of
the
country
s
failed
economic
policies
pemex
is
set
to
begin
crude
imports
in
november
for
the
first
time
in
over
a
decade
it
needs
them
to
feed
mexico
s
main
refinery
which
is
working
below
capacity
due
to
a
lack
of
light
oil
the
purchase
of
million
barrels
of
bakken
crude
will
follow
a
tender
awarded
earlier
this
week
to
phillips
up
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
imports
are
planned
for
the
last
quarter
of
this
announcement
is
another
example
of
the
great
failure
of
economic
policies
in
the
last
years
lopez
obrador
said
on
twitter
once
he
takes
power
in
december
lopez
obrador
could
force
pemex
to
halt
the
imports
which
would
likely
impact
domestic
refining
and
boost
the
need
for
other
kinds
of
imported
fuel
the
issue
has
divided
opinion
among
his
allies
one
of
his
economic
advisers
abel
hibert
said
earlier
this
month
that
crude
imports
could
continue
as
a
way
to
increase
processing
levels
at
mexico
s
refineries
even
after
lopez
obrador
takes
office
i
think
pemex
has
good
reason
to
do
it
due
to
current
market
conditions
he
told
local
media
mexico
s
light
crude
output
has
declined
faster
than
expected
this
year
hit
by
operational
problems
at
the
xanab
oilfield
pemex
chief
executive
carlos
trevino
has
said
the
company
s
goal
of
producing
million
bpd
of
crude
this
year
will
not
be
met
and
that
the
target
is
also
likely
to
be
missed
if
pemex
does
not
start
crude
imports
for
its
refining
network
purchases
of
finished
fuel
especially
gasoline
would
grow
again
to
satisfy
mexico
s
consumption
of
about
million
bpd
analysts
have
said
lopez
obrador
s
main
plan
for
the
oil
industry
involves
building
a
new
refinery
to
boost
fuel
production
while
reducing
crude
exports
with
the
final
goal
of
halting
them
he
has
criticized
his
predecessor
s
opening
of
the
oil
and
gas
industry
to
foreign
investment
but
has
not
given
details
of
how
he
would
reverse
the
country
s
dwindling
crude
production
rating
agencies
moody
s
and
fitch
earlier
this
month
said
cutting
oil
exports
would
imply
a
significant
cash
flow
sacrifice
for
pemex
whose
main
source
of
revenue
is
crude
exports
fitch
changed
pemex
s
outlook
to
negative
from
stable
