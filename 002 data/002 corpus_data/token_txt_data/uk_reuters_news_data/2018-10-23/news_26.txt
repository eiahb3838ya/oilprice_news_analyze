data
shows
that
percent

nearly

daily
waste
is
plastic
a
bus
can
collect
up
to
kg
lb
of
plastic
bottles
a
day
or
roughly
tonnes
in
a
month
the
data
shows
after
collection
labels
and
bottle
caps
are
removed
from
the
waste
and
it
is
auctioned
off
to
recycling
companies
money
earned
from
the
auction
goes
toward
running
the
bus
operations
and
to
fund
green
spaces

on
the

home
to
the
largest
expanse

tropical
rainforest
in
asia
but
also
struggles
with
traffic
in
its
congested

indonesia

one
of
the
biggest
contributors
in
the
world
for
plastic
