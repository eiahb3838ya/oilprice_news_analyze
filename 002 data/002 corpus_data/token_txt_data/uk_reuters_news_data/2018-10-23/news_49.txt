the

in

since

a

the

the

nymex

short

have
jumped
by
million
barrels
over
the
last
seven
weeks
in
what
is
starting
to
look
like
the
start
of
the
first
new
cycle
for
over
a
year
lingering
concern
about
the
impact
of
sanctions
on
iran
s
exports
and
the
availability
of
crude
oil
has
helped
to
keep
many
fund
managers
long
but
doubts
about
the
state
of
the
global
economy
and
the
outlook
for
oil
consumption
in
are
weighing
on
oil
prices
as
well
as
equities
saudi
arabia
s
international
position
has
weakened
after
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
was
killed
inside
its
consulate
in
istanbul
leaving
it
reliant
on
goodwill
of
the
united
states
the
prospect
of
diplomatic
isolation
makes
it
more
likely
saudi
arabia
will
pump
extra
oil
and
try
to
keep
prices
lower
than
before
to
protect
relations
with
the
united
states
even
before
the
khashoggi
crisis
the
white
house
had
made
clear
that
it
expects
saudi
arabia
to
pump
more
oil
to
compensate
for
the
loss
of
exports
from
iran
and
keep
prices
below
per
barrel
finally
with
spot
prices
and
calendar
spreads
coming
under
pressure
the
incentive
for
fund
managers
to
realise
some
profits
after
the
previous
rally
has
sharpened
and
the
liquidation
has
become
from
a
positioning
perspective
the
hedge
fund
community
s
stance
now
appears
less
lopsided
than
at
the
end
of
september
some
of
the
liquidation
risk
that
was
hanging
over
the
market
has
been
removed
because
it
has
already
been
realised
but
fund
managers
are
still
fairly
long
of
crude
and
refined
products
and
the
fundamental
outlook
appears
more
uncertain
than
before
