london
reuters
james
dyson
the
billionaire
british
inventor
of
the
bagless
vacuum
cleaner
has
chosen
to
build
his
electric
car
in
singapore
to
be
close
to
asian
customers
supply
chains
and
a
highly
skilled
workforce
the
entrepreneur
who
backed
brexit
in
the
referendum
already
manufactures
products
such
as
hair
dryers
air
purification
systems
and
bladeless
fans
in
asia
while
the
company
s
research
and
development
remains
in
britain
dyson
said
last
year
that
a
engineering
team
had
been
secretly
working
for
more
than
two
years
on
a
billion
project
to
build
an
electric
car
the
company
one
of
britain
s
biggest
manufacturing
success
stories
has
not
shown
any
designs
for
its
electric
vehicle
although
james
dyson
has
said
it
will
not
be
like
anything
else
on
the
market
and
will
not
be
a
very
cheap
dyson
who
is
not
working
with
established
car
companies
on
the
project
had
said
the
vehicle
would
be
made
close
to
suppliers
and
its
potential
biggest
markets
namely
in
asia
the
decision
of
where
to
make
our
car
is
complex
based
on
supply
chains
access
to
markets
and
the
availability
of
the
expertise
that
will
help
us
achieve
our
ambitions
dyson
chief
executive
jim
rowan
said
after
singapore
was
chosen
on
tuesday
dyson
already
employs
people
making
million
digital
electric
motors
every
year
in
singapore
it
said
it
would
build
a
new
manufacturing
facility
in
the
city
state
scheduled
for
completion
in
with
the
first
cars
rolling
off
production
lines
a
year
later
singapore
s
prime
minister
lee
hsien
loong
said
singapore
used
to
assemble
cars
until
the
now
we
will
manufacture
cars
again
except
this
time
greener
better
and
more
high
tech
carmakers
are
stepping
up
investment
in
electric
vehicles
in
response
to
emissions
restrictions
and
penalties
on
the
use
of
internal
combustion
engines
with
some
countries
already
promising
outright
bans
dyson
is
looking
to
exploit
its
ability
in
battery
technology
and
electric
motors
that
are
found
in
its
innovative
vacuum
cleaners
and
other
products
james
dyson
told
reporters
last
year
that
his
ambition
to
take
on
the
car
makers
was
triggered
when
the
industry
dismissed
his
idea
to
use
the
cyclonic
technology
that
revolutionised
vacuum
cleaners
to
clean
diesel
exhaust
emissions
in
the
the
inventor
was
a
prominent
backer
of
britain
s
vote
to
leave
the
european
union
and
has
argued
that
britain
s
future
lies
in
building
close
ties
with
markets
in
asia
and
not
europe
singapore
is
a
densely
populated
and
one
of
the
world
s
most
expensive
places
to
own
a
car
it
controls
vehicle
population
through
a
system
of
bidding
for
the
right
to
own
and
use
a
vehicle
for
a
limited
number
of
years
elon
musk
chief
executive
of
tesla
criticised
singapore
for
not
being
supportive
of
electric
vehicles
earlier
this
year
but
the
city
state
has
trade
agreements
with
china
and
japan
and
dyson
ceo
rowan
said
the
comparatively
high
cost
base
would
be
offset
by
its
technology
expertise
and
focus
it
is
therefore
the
right
place
to
make
technology
loaded
machines
and
the
right
place
to
make
our
electric
vehicle
he
said
dyson
started
its
work
on
the
electric
car
in
wiltshire
western
england
where
it
is
investing
million
pounds
million
in
new
buildings
and
a
testing
track
at
its
campus
the
company
reported
a
percent
rise
in
turnover
to
billion
pounds
last
year
and
a
percent
rise
in
earnings
to
million
pounds
with
percent
of
the
growth
coming
from
asia
