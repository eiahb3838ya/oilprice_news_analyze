as
data

the
american
petroleum

api
showed
a
large
increase
in
crude
inventories
the
severity
of
the
drop
is
pretty
striking
but
in
today
s
trading
world
we
have
these
kind
of
days
a
little
more
often
now
we
have
to
wait
and
see
if

the

spilled
over
into

mcgillian
said
adding
that
investors
will
be
watching
closely
to
see
if
the

in
saudi

materializes

saudi
energy
minister
khalid
told
a
conference
in
riyadh
the
oil
market
was
in
a
good
place
and
he
hoped
oil
producers
would
sign
a
deal
in
december
to
extend
cooperation
to
monitor
and
stabilise
the
market
we
will
decide
if
there
are
any
disruptions
from
supply
especially
with
the
iran
sanctions
looming
falih
said
then
we
will
continue
with
the
mindset
we
have
now
which
is
to
meet
any
demand
that
materializes
to
ensure
customers
are
falih
said
he
would
not
rule
out
the
possibility
that
saudi
arabia
would
produce
between
million
and
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
more
than
current
levels
in
future
sanctions
on
iranian
oil
begin
on
and
washington
has
said
it
wants
to
stop
all
of
tehran
s
fuel
exports
but
other
oil
producers
are
pumping
more
to
fill
any
supply
gaps
the
oil
market
has
been
concerned
that
saudi
arabia
might
cut
crude
supply
in
retaliation
for
potential
sanctions
over
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
falih
said
on
monday
there
was
no
intention
of
doing
that
economist
intelligence
unit
energy
analyst
peter
kiernan
said
it
would
be
for
saudi
arabia
to
cut
oil
supply
as
it
would
risk
losing
market
share
to
other
exporters
while
losing
its
reputation
as
a
stable
player
in
the
market
ubs
analysts
expect
oil
demand
growth
to
slow
to
million
bpd
in
on
higher
oil
prices
and
weaker
economic
growth
slightly
above
the
average
adding
that
demand
is
forecast
to
be
flat
in
oecd
countries
with
china
and
india
continuing
to
drive
growth
