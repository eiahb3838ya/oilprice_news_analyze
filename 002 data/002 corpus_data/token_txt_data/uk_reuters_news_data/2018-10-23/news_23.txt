russia
s
rosneft
and
exxonmobil
plan
to
build
a
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
plant
in
a
consortium
with
indian
and
japanese
partners
spreading
the
estimated
billion
cost
two
sources
familiar
with
the
talks
said
the
four
companies
rosneft
exxon
japan
s
sodeco
and
india
s
ongc
videsh
are
partners
in
the
group
of
fields
that
will
supply
the
gas
but
exxon
and
rosneft
had
initially
planned
to
build
the
lng
plant
without
the
other
consortium
members
as
well
as
spreading
the
costs
among
more
stakeholders
the
broader
involvement
of
the
participants
may
mitigate
sanctions
risk
initially
rosneft
and
exxon
unveiled
their
joint
plans
to
build
an
lng
production
site
in
russia
s
far
east
to
president
vladimir
putin
in
but
production
of
the
seaborne
gas
has
so
far
failed
to
materialize
for
many
reasons
including
international
sanctions
against
moscow
for
its
role
in
the
ukraine
conflict
lng
production
itself
is
not
subject
to
sanctions
but
russian
companies
have
limited
access
to
financial
markets
due
to
the
restrictions
exxon
had
to
leave
most
of
its
other
new
joint
projects
with
rosneft
due
to
the
west
s
punitive
measures
against
moscow
two
sources
one
person
close
to
exxon
and
a
rosneft
executive
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
said
both
firms
are
committed
to
carrying
out
the
lng
plant
project
within
the
framework
of
the
agreement
a
hydrocarbon
project
is
led
by
exxon
with
a
percent
stake
twenty
percent
belongs
to
rosneft
with
the
rest
split
between
sodeco
percent
and
ongc
videsh
percent
no
one
is
interested
in
financing
such
a
project
alone
the
source
close
to
exxon
said
asked
how
the
lng
plant
deal
would
be
structured
the
senior
rosneft
executive
said
it
will
be
the
sources
did
not
say
how
the
financing
of
the
lng
plant
would
be
shared
between
the
participants
the
source
close
to
exxon
said
a
decision
whether
to
go
ahead
with
the
lng
project
was
expected
in
otherwise
the
project
risked
losing
its
market
amid
growing
competition
currently
two
lng
plants
novatek
s
yamal
lng
and
gazprom
s
are
producing
the
frozen
gas
in
russia
which
has
set
an
ambitious
target
of
more
than
doubling
its
global
lng
market
share
to
percent
in
the
next
decade
is
pumping
close
to
barrels
of
crude
oil
per
day
a
record
high
as
well
as
natural
gas
that
it
has
been
unable
to
sell
abroad
gazprom
has
the
exclusive
rights
to
export
pipeline
gas
from
russia
has
to
pump
most
of
the
gas
back
into
the
ground
while
a
small
amount
goes
to
local
customers
in
the
sparsely
populated
region
talks
with
gazprom
and
the
consortium
over
gas
sales
have
not
yet
yielded
any
results
rosneft
ongc
and
sodeco
declined
to
comment
the
russian
energy
ministry
and
the
government
also
declined
to
make
any
immediate
comment
the
consortium
continues
to
explore
every
opportunity
to
monetize
gas
resources

s
khabarovsk

where
