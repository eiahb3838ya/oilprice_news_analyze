crude
oil
cargoes
are
trading
at
discounts
in
asia
after
opec
producers
increased
supplies
to
replace
iranian
oil
and
as
natural
disasters
crimped
demand
from
japan
industry
sources
said
on
tuesday
the
market
has
unexpectedly
weakened
this
month
for
cargoes
loading
in
december
with
most
grades
ranging
from
murban
from
abu
dhabi
to
qatar
s
land
and
marine
crude
trading
at
discounts
to
their
respective
price
markers
that
is
in
sharp
contrast
to
last
month
when
spot
premiums
for
november
cargoes
hit
highs
as
buyers
scaled
back
on
iranian
oil
imports
ahead
of
sanctions
on
tehran
that
start
from
saudi
arabia
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
have
increased
exports
to
asia
after
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
russia
pledged
to
boost
output
to
stabilise
global
oil
prices
after
they
hit
highs
refiners
last
month
asked
for
a
lot
of
saudi
incremental
oil
said
a
trader
with
a
north
asian
refiner
helping
explain
why
there
has
been
so
much
saudi
supply
this
month
the
sources
who
declined
to
be
identified
as
they
were
not
authorised
to
speak
with
media
said
saudi
aramco
was
increasing
arab
extra
light
supplies
to
some
refiners
in
northern
asia
that
comes
after
other
sources
previously
told
reuters
that
aramco
is
supplying
buyers
in
india
with
million
barrels
more
oil
aramco
does
not
typically
comment
on
commercial
transactions
abu
dhabi
national
oil
company
and
kuwait
petroleum
corp
have
also
both
launched
new
crude
grades
that
will
add
a
total
of
about
barrels
per
day
of
light
oil
supply
there
is
ample
supply
of
light
sour
crude
arab
extra
light
adnoc
grades
and
kazakhstan
s
cpc
blend
said
a
second
trader
with
a
north
asian
refiner
the
arbitrage
for
crude
produced
in
the
atlantic
basin
and
the
united
states
to
asia
has
also
opened
after
brent
s
premium
to
dubai
swaps
narrowed
and
as
grades
such
as
cpc
blend
trade
at
deep
discounts
traders
said
despite
the
supply
asia
s
actual
spot
demand
was
lower
than
expected
the
first
trader
said
because
of
a
lower
appetite
from
japanese
refiners
after
operations
at
their
plants
were
hit
by
typhoons
and
an
earthquake
in
september
and
october
our
utilisation
rate
is
not
so
high
currently
so
our
spot
purchases
are
at
a
minimum
quantity
said
a
japanese
oil
buyer
refiners
such
as
idemitsu
kosan
co
and
jxtg
nippon
oil
energy
corp
are
resuming
operations
at
their
plants
in
hokkaido
and
osaka
after
some
units
were
shut
for
a
month
refiners
have
also
turned
cautious
after
complex
margins
at
a
typical
singapore
refinery
dropped
to
the
lowest
in
three
months
driven
by
ample
gasoline
supplies
