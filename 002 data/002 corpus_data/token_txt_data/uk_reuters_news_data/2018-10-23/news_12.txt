washington
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
said
on
friday
it
has
withdrawn
a
regulation
proposed
in
the
last
days
of
the
obama
administration
that
aimed
to
tighten
health
and
safety
compliance
rules
for
uranium
miners
on
a
day
before
donald
trump
took
office
as
president
the
epa
had
proposed
standards
to
regulate
byproduct
materials
produced
by
uranium
recovery
isr
activities
with
a
primary
focus
on
groundwater
protection
and
restoration
on
friday
the
epa
said
existing
rules
were
enough
for
the
protection
of
public
health
and
safety
from
radiological
and
hazards
associated
with
uranium
and
thorium
ore
processing
the
decision
is
the
latest
by
the
republican
trump
administration
to
roll
back
environmental
rules
promoted
by
former
president
barack
obama
a
democrat
epa
s
acting
administrator
andrew
wheeler
said
the
proposed
rule
change
would
have
imposed
significant
burdens
on
uranium
producers
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
has
regulated
in
situ
uranium
recovery
for
nearly
years
the
agency
has
never
found
an
instance
of
ground
water
contamination
that
would
be
addressed
by
this
rule
said
senate
environment
and
public
works
chairman
john
barrasso
a
republican
the
national
mining
association
nma
hailed
the
decision
the
rule
failed
to
articulate
a
risk
that
justified
the
rulemaking
ignored
the
need
for
a
realistic
analysis
and
underestimated
compliance
costs
and
impacts
to
small
businesses
nma
president
hall
quinn
said
this
story
has
been
refilled
to
correct
attribution
in
paragraph
to
senate
environment
panel
chairman
instead
of
acting
epa
administrator
