an
ugly
start
to
european
trading
pushed
world
shares
towards
their
lowest
level
in
a
year
on
tuesday
as
negative
drivers
from
saudi
arabia
s
diplomatic
isolation
to
worries
about
italy
s
finances
and
trade
wars
piled
on
the
pressure
selling
escalated
from
wall
street
into
a
heavy
selloff
in
asia
before
hitting
europe
which
was
facing
a
fifth
day
of
uninterrupted
declines
the
tech
sector
posted
the
worst
performance
after
chipmaker
ams
plunged
percent
as
its
outlook
triggered
alarm
bells
but
there
was
a
broader
force
at
play
the
stoxx
was
near
a
low
with
almost
half
of
its
stocks
now
in
territory
down
percent
from
their
peak
germany
s
dax
also
fell
to
late
lows
london
s
ftse
was
down
near
april
lows
and
msci
s
world
share
index
was
just
two
points
of
a
low
this
morning
weaker
stocks
in
asia
raised
some
eyebrows
and
overall
sentiment
is
suffering
from
trade
tensions
italy
to
brexit
a
concoction
of
concerns
said
ing
strategist
benjamin
schroeder
the
euro
also
fell
towards
a
low
and
italian
bonds
struggled
before
a
european
commission
meeting
that
could
see
brussels
take
the
unprecedented
step
of
demanding
changes
to
italy
s
recently
laid
out
budget
plans
that
has
bred
some
doubt
about
the
european
central
bank
raising
interest
rates
next
summer
leaving
the
euro
at
doubts
about
britain
s
prime
minister
mired
in
a
stalemate
over
brexit
kept
the
pressure
on
sterling
all
that
contributed
to
the
mood
with
the
japanese
yen
and
swiss
franc
strengthening
while
currencies
like
the
australian
and
new
zealand
dollars
fell
the
prospect
of
a
normalisation
of
ecb
monetary
policy
was
the
main
reason
why
the
euro
was
able
to
appreciate
over
the
past
year
however
there
is
a
rising
risk
that
this
support
is
now
going
to
crumble
commerzbank
analyst
thu
lan
nguyen
said
markets
were
also
waiting
for
turkey
s
president
to
reveal
his
country
s
take
on
the
killing
of
saudi
arabian
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
a
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
this
month
saudi
arabia
a
top
crude
oil
exporter
faces
international
pressure
to
provide
all
the
facts
about
an
incident
that
has
raised
a
global
storm
and
added
the
threat
of
sanctions
against
the
kingdom
to
a
list
of
market
concerns
president
donald
trump
said
on
monday
he
was
not
satisfied
with
what
he
had
heard
from
saudi
arabia
about
the
killing
but
expressed
reluctance
to
punish
the
kingdom
economically
investors
worry
that
may
lead
to
saudi
retaliation
through
crude
oil
although
a
saudi
pledge
to
play
a
responsible
role
and
keep
markets
supplied

a
barrel
down
percent

asia

overnight
tumble
gave
back
some
of
the
ground

region
had
clawed
back
over
the
last
two
sessions
msci

broadest
index
of
asian

to
a
low
with

even
more
pronounced

both
fell

and
