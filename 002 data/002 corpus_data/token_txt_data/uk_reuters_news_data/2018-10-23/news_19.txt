nissan
s
leaf
became
the
first
electric
vehicle
ev
to
secure
regulatory
approval
as
an
energy
backstop
for
germany
s
electricity
grid
the
japanese
carmaker
said
on
tuesday
something
it
hopes
will
attract
corporate
fleet
customers
technology
is
a
connection
between
the
ev
and
the
grid
through
which
power
can
flow
from
the
grid
to
the
vehicle
and
that
potentially
enables
car
owners
to
sell
energy
to
the
network
while
utilities
could
use
electric
cars
as
a
backstop
if
demand
rises
nissan
said
it
would
initially
target
corporate
clients
with
fleets
of
more
than
electric
vehicles
adding
that
services
based
on
technology
would
be
offered
in
germany
from
next
year
onwards
there
will
be
million
electric
vehicles
by
according
to
estimates
by
the
international
energy
agency
compared
with
more
than
million
last
year
we
strongly
believe
in
an
future
guillaume
pelletreau
vice
president
and
managing
director
nissan
center
europe
said
leaf
batteries
could
make
an
important
contribution
to
energy
transition
in
germany
and
a
sustainable
the
initiative
was
also
supported
by
the
mobility
house
local
utility
enervie
and
german
transmission
system
operator
amprion
which
is
by
rwe
and
infrastructure
investors

munich

nissan
is
relying
on
the
chademo
charging
standard
which
has
been
jointly
developed
by
several
japanese
companies
as
a
competitor
to
tesla
s
supercharger
system
and
the
combined
charging
system
ccs
that
puts
nissan
at
odds
with
european
carmakers
including
bmw
and
volkswagen
who
are
pushing
to
have
the
ccs
which
is
also
capable
of
services
established
nissan
is
ahead
for
now
but
other
technologies
including
tesla
s
supercharger
can
theoretically
do
the
same
thing
said
thomas
raffeiner
chief
executive
and
founder
of
the
mobility
house
nissan
has
so
far
sold
about
electric
vehicles
and
along
with
top
shareholder
renault
has
been
very
active
in
exploring
how
car
batteries
can
be
integrated
into
the
wider
power
system
while
a
mass
uptake
of
evs
is
expected
to
put
a
major
strain
on
the
power
grid
and
require
billions
of
euros
in
infrastructure
investments
car
batteries
have
already
proven
that
they
can
become
part
of
the
network
