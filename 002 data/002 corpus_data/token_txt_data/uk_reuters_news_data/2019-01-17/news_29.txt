the
spot
price
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
in
asia
has
completely
missed
its
usual
winter
peak
with
much
of
the
blame
being
laid
at
the
door
of
temperatures
trimming
demand
that
sounds
perfectly
plausible
but
doesn
t
quite
tally
with
the
fact
that
delivered
volumes
into
the
major
consuming
region
of
northeast
asia
hit
a
in
december
a
total
of
million
tonnes
of
the
fuel
were
delivered
in
december
to
the
region
which
includes
the
top
three
consumers
of
japan
china
and
south
korea
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
refinitiv
this
was
up
percent
from
the
same
month
in
adding
to
a
gain
in
shipments
in
november
from
the
same
month
a
year
earlier
it
was
also
the
most
on
record
eclipsing
the
million
tonnes
from
january
china
was
the
main
driver
of
the
jump
in
imports
with
million
tonnes
arriving
in
december
up
percent
from
the
same
month
in
top
consumer
japan
saw
imports
weaken
dropping
by
percent
to
million
tonnes
in
december
whilst
south
korea
recorded
an
increase
to
million
tonnes
the
shipping
data
does
show
that
lng
demand
was
strong
for
the
first
part
of
the
northern
winter
but
it
doesn
t
yet
give
a
picture
of
how
the
rest
of
the
cold
season
will
play
out
it
s
here
that
the
spot
pricing
comes
into
play
and
this
is
pointing
to
a
weak
of
winter
the
spot
price
for
cargoes
delivered
to
asia
was
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
in
the
week
ended
it
has
been
trending
down
since
a
minor
early
winter
peak
of
per
mmbtu
in
the
week
to
and
is
well
below
the
of
reached
in
the
week
to
june
the
spot
price
is
usually
for
deliveries
of
around
four
to
eight
weeks
in
advance
so
the
current
price
reflects
cargoes
that
will
arrive
in
february
it
s
worth
noting
that
the
reached
in
reflected
cargoes
delivered
in
december
when
demand
reached
an
high
in
northeast
asia
the
fact
that
even
this
strong
demand
couldn
t
spark
a
sustained
rally
in
prices
shows
that
it
s
more
likely
ample
supply
is
playing
a
greater
role
than
demand
this
view
is
supported
by
spot
prices
for
march
delivery
at
around
per
mmbtu
being
weaker
than
those
for
february
there
is
usually
a
sharp
drop
in
spot
lng
prices
as
winter
ends
and
the
market
enters
the
shoulder
season
of
spring
and
the
strength
of
any
summer
recovery
is
largely
dependent
on
how
hot
the
weather
is
as
this
drives
power
demand
for
the
fact
that
the
winter
rally
in
lng
prices
didn
t
materialise
even
in
the
face
of
solid
demand
growth
raises
the
possibility
of
a
the
market
narrative
of
lng
has
swung
in
recent
months
from
one
of
an
expected
oversupply
on
the
back
of
a
raft
of
new
projects
mainly
in
australia
and
the
united
states
to
a
consensus
that
strong
demand
growth
in
asia
will
lead
to
a
deficit
in
coming
years
unless
new
ventures
are
sanctioned
however
while
this
view
may
well
be
correct
from
a
perspective
it
doesn
t
preclude
the
possibility
of
to
periods
where
supply
exceeds
demand
this
may
be
the
situation
for
the
next
few
months
as
the
spot
market
struggles
to
absorb
the
extra
supply
from
projects
that
came
online
in
these
include
two
australian
projects
in
inpex
s
million
tonnes
per
annum
icythys
venture
and
royal
dutch
shell
s
prelude
floating
plant
as
well
as
dominion
s
cove
point
and
cheniere
s
corpus
christi
projects
in
the
united
states
while
the
outlook
for
lng
demand
growth
appears
to
be
rosy
once
again
the
market
may
have
little
bouts
of
indigestion
every
now
and
again
as
it
has
to
absorb
the
lumpy
nature
of
supply
