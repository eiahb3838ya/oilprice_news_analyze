concern
over
china
s
economic
outlook
and
possible
tariffs
on
european
cars
dragged
stocks
lower
on
thursday
while
an
end
to
the
latest
chapter
in
the
brexit
saga
offered
sterling
a
moment
s
peace
fresh
news
had
been
thin
on
the
ground
during
the
european
morning
but
dealers
had
more
than
enough
to
digest
from
the
last
hours
to
follow
asia
s
lead
and
nudge
the
main
bourses
into
the
red
europe
s
carmakers
fell
as
much
as
percent
after
senate
finance
committee
chairman
charles
grassley
said
he
thought
donald
trump
was
inclined
to
impose
tariffs
on
european
cars
to
win
better
terms
on
agriculture
banks
were
hit
by
disappointing
societe
generale
results
and
the
tech
sector
was
under
pressure
too
after
one
of
world
s
biggest
chip
producers
taiwan
semiconductor
forecast
its
steepest
drop
in
revenue
in
a
decade
there
is
some
focus
on
the
grassley
comments
in
relation
to
auto
trade
tariffs
and
also
reference
to
there
not
being
much
progress
in
the
china
negotiations
last
week
said
bank
of
tokyo
mitsubishi
strategist
derek
halpenny
there
has
obviously
been
a
lot
of
optimism
in
markets
since
the
start
of
the
year
and
risk
appetite
has
had
a
pretty
good
run
but
this
will
place
a
few
question
marks
over
msci
s
broadest
index
of
world
stocks
was
fractionally
lower
having
hit
a
high
markets
like
japan
had
dithered
in
both
directions
while
futures
pointed
to
wall
street
starting
percent
lower
some
took
heart
at
beijing
s
confirmation
that
chinese
vice
premier
liu
he
will
travel
to
the
united
states
on
for
more
negotiations
with
washington
but
it
wasn
t
enough
to
tip
the
balance
more
broadly
china
s
index
had
ended
down
percent
led
lower
by
a
decline
in
the
country
s
home
appliances
maker
gree
electric
after
it
warned
of
slower
profit
growth
as
the
economy
loses
steam
chinese
premier
li
keqiang
promised
increased
government
investment
this
year
and
the
country
s
central
bank
injected
more
cash
into
the
financial
system
bringing
the
amount
for
the
week
to
trillion
yuan
billion
stoking
additional
caution
however
was
news
that
lawmakers
introduced
bills
on
wednesday
that
would
ban
the
sale
of
chips
or
other
components
to
huawei
or
other
chinese
telecoms
firms
that
violate
sanctions
or
export
control
laws
that
came
shortly
before
the
wall
street
journal
reported
federal
prosecutors
were
investigating
allegations
that
huawei
stole
trade
secrets
from
businesses
separately
handelsblatt
reported
the
german
government
is
actively
considering
stricter
security
requirements
and
other
ways
to
exclude
huawei
from
a
buildout
of
mobile
networks
also
lurking
were
worries
the
government
shutdown
was
starting
to
take
a
toll
on
its
economy
white
house
economic
adviser
kevin
hassett
said
the
shutdown
would
shave
percent
off
quarterly
economic
growth
for
each
week
it
goes
on
as
expected
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
narrowly
won
a
confidence
vote
overnight
and
invited
other
party
leaders
for
talks
to
try
to
break
the
impasse
on
a
brexit
agreement
an
outline
for
plan
b
is
due
by
next
monday
and
markets
are
currently
assuming
that
with
no
easy
way
forward
for
may
she
will
have
to
extend
the
date
of
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
past
the
scheduled
march
nothing
has
happened
in
the
last
hours
to
dissuade
us
from
the
view
that
we
are
headed
in
the
direction
of
an
article
delay
a
softer
brexit
or
no
