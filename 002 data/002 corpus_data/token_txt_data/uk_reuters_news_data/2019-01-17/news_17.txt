socalgas pulls more natgas from aliso as california cold snap drains storage
jan
reuters
facing
a
colder
winter
than
usual
southern
california
gas
said
it
will
pull
more
natural
gas
from
the
aliso
canyon
storage
facility
which
has
been
treated
as
an
asset
of
last
resort
since
a
massive
leak
in
resulted
in
evacuation
of
a
neighborhood
socalgas
a
unit
of
california
energy
company
sempra
energy
said
it
needs
to
draw
gas
from
aliso
canyon
so
it
can
limit
reductions
at
other
storage
caverns
to
preserve
supplies
in
case
the
weather
remains
cold
later
this
winter
we
are
experiencing
colder
weather
than
last
winter
and
already
have
less
gas
in
our
storage
fields
than
this
time
last
year
socalgas
said
in
a
filing
with
state
regulators
made
available
this
week
the
utility
said
it
needs
gas
from
its
storage
fields
to
bolster
what
its
pipelines
can
deliver
to
meet
consumer
heating
demand
on
the
coldest
winter
days
aliso
is
the
biggest
field
for
socalgas
but
the
utility
is
limited
in
what
it
can
pull
out
of
aliso
following
the
massive
leak
between
october
and
february
after
the
leak
the
state
mandated
aliso
can
be
used
only
to
maintain
system
reliability
after
all
other
storage
facilities
and
pipelines
have
been
exhausted
if
southern
california
experiences
persistent
cold
weather
conditions
our
storage
assets
will
not
be
positioned
to
respond
unless
we
act
now
socalgas
said
in
explaining
why
it
would
pull
more
gas
out
of
aliso
to
preserve
supplies
in
other
caverns
gas
supplies
were
expected
to
remain
tight
in
southern
california
this
winter
due
to
limitations
on
several
socalgas
pipelines
and
reduced
availability
of
aliso
socalgas
projected
demand
would
average
billion
cubic
feet
per
day
bcfd
for
the
rest
of
january
most
of
that
gas
will
come
from
other
regions
flowing
into
the
state
on
the
utility
s
pipelines
but
some
will
have
to
come
from
its
storage
facilities
on
for
example
the
utility
s
pipelines
delivered
just
bcfd
of
the
system
s
bcfd
of
demand
the
rest
came
from
storage
socalgas
said
its
storage
fields
were
only
able
to
deliver
bcfd
down
from
bcfd
before
the
socalgas
website
said
about
bcf
of
gas
is
left
in
storage
most
of
it
in
aliso
down
from
bcf
a
year
ago
and
well
off
the
average
of
bcf
socalgas
has
also
urged
consumers
to
reduce
gas
use
especially
when
temperatures
are
extremely
cold
and
has
worked
with
electric
grid
operators
to
limit
the
amount
of
gas
power
plants
burn
