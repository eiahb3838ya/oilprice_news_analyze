the
world
s
population
must
drastically
change
diets
in
order
to
prevent
potentially
catastrophic
damage
to
the
planet
scientists
have
warned
global
food
production
is
the
largest
strain
on
the
earth
caused
by
humans
and
unsustainable
farming
is
already
driving
climate
change
deforestation
and
biodiversity
loss
found
a
major
project
commissioned
by
the
lancet
health
journal
as
researchers
warned
that
people
must
sharply
cut
the
amount
of
meat
they
eat
to
live
sustainably
here
is
why
managing
food
supply
is
key
to
controlling
climate
change
food
production
creates
about
a
quarter
of
all
greenhouse
gas
emissions
experts
estimate
livestock
farming
for
meat
and
dairy
represents
more
than
half
of
that
total
at
percent
of
all
emissions
with
cattle
the
biggest
offenders
agriculture
is
the
biggest
single
driver
of
deforestation
stripping
away
forests
that
reduce
climate
change
by
absorbing
and
storing
carbon
livestock
takes
up
the
most
space
with
land
used
to
grow
animal
feed
and
for
grazing
using
nearly
percent
of
all
agricultural
land
about
percent
of
the
world
s
freshwater
is
used
for
agriculture
with
climate
change
expected
to
increase
the
number
of
people
facing
water
scarcity
more
efficient
farming
could
reduce
water
use
helping
to
meet
climate
challenges
up
to
a
third
of
all
food
is
wasted
totalling
around
billion
tonnes
per
year
it
results
in
unnecessary
emissions
and
means
food
does
not
reach
those
who
need
it
experts
predict
the
amount
of
food
waste
will
rise
further
without
action
the
number
of
people
on
earth
is
expected
to
grow
to
billion
by
adding
pressure
on
the
world
s
resources
it
is
estimated
that
world
food
production
may
have
to
double
to
keep
pace

demographic
changes
