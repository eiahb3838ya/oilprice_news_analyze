china
put
just
over
gigawatts
gw

capacity
into
operation
in
down
percent
from

earlier
an
industry
group
said
on
thursday
after
a
government
move
to
curb
new
capacity
and
ease
a
subsidy
payment
backlog
the
new

took
the
country
s
total
installed
solar
power
capacity
to
more
than
gw
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
china
photovoltaic
industry
association
cpia
said
china
announced
last
year
that
it
would
suspend
new
projects
after
a
record
gw

increase

struggling
to
find
spare

capacity
and
pay
a
renewable

backlog
amounting

more

billion
last

china
is
also
aiming
to
gradually
phase

to
the
solar
industry
after
a
decline
in
costs
announcing
last
week
that
it
would
launch
a
series
of
new
projects
but
solar
manufacturers
are
already
feeling
the
pinch
and
warned
last
year
they
were
facing
closure
after
a
surge
in
new
production
capacity
in
previous
years
sent
component
prices
plummeting
facing
a
lot
of
complicated
domestic
and
overseas
trends
the
sector
as
a
whole
is
under
big
pressures
and
substandard
producers
are
expected
to
promptly
exit
the
market

output
of
solar

china
s
solar
manufacturers
have
been
accused
of
using
subsidies
to
drive
down
prices
and
put
foreign
competitors
out
of
business
but
they
claim
they
have
been
the
beneficiary
of
a
fierce
competitive
environment
forcing
them
to
reduce
costs
the
united
states
imposed
tariffs
on
china
s
solar
products
last
year
and
its
share
of
china
s
exports
fell
from
