opensc
is
a
website
that
harnesses
blockchain
technology
to
allow
users
to
scan
a
qr
code
on
a
product
or
menu
that
reveals
the
full
history
and
supply
chain
before
they
buy
for
those
catching
and
producing
things
in
a
very
unsustainable
way
it
s
quite
easy
for
them
to
hide
behind
the
complexity
of
supply
chains
said
paul
hunyor
asia
region
head
at
bcg
digital
ventures
in
sydney
there
is
a
lack
of
carrots
for
those
doing
good
at
the
production
end
because
it
is
very
hard
for
them
to
make
the
end
consumer
aware
of
all
the
good
work
they
re
doing
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
globally
consumers
and
retailers
are
demanding
more
information
about
what
they
procure
buy
and
eat
to
ascertain
that
its
production
and
transportation
does
not
damage
the
environment
or
use
illegal
and
unethical
business
practices
in
response
large
consumer
goods
companies
restaurants
and
other
businesses
are
looking
at
ways
to
attract
more
customers
by
offering
sustainable
products
that
are
guaranteed
as
free
of
deforestation
or
slave
labour
for
example
the
opensc
platform
conceived
in
when
wwf
was
piloting
a
tuna
fisheries
traceability
project
in
the
pacific
ocean
will
initially
focus
on
fish
and
beef
it
plans
to
expand
in
the
next
two
years
to
cover
other
commodities
like
palm
oil
and
timber
opensc
allows
consumers
to
cut
through
the
complexity
and
lack
of
transparency
in
supply
chains
said
hunyor
the
digital
tool
will
cover
environmental
social
and
human
rights
and
hopes
to
attract
sustainability
bodies
and
schemes
as
well
as
corporations
and
major
commodities
producers
said
dermot
o
gorman
ceo
of
there
is
growing
momentum
around
the
world
with
corporates
who
are
doing
and
want
to
do
the
right
thing
because
their
customers
are
increasing
demand
he
said
austral
fisheries
which
is
part
of
the
maruha
nichiro
group
has
committed
to
implement
opensc
this
year
across
its
fleet
which
catches
patagonian
toothfish
customers
and
staff
of
supermarkets
and
restaurants
as
well
as
wholesalers
can
use
the
tool
to
access
instant
information
for
fish
that
would
include
where
it
was
caught
if
the
area
is
a
verified
sustainable
fishing
zone
and
conditions
along
the
supply
chain
fish
tracked
by
opensc
set
up
as
a
social
enterprise
will
be
