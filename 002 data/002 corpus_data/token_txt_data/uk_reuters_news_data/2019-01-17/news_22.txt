canadian
oil
producer
husky
energy
shocked
investors
on
thursday
when
it
abandoned
its
hostile
bid
for
meg
energy
saying
it
could
not
win
sufficient
meg
shareholder
support
after
alberta
s
government
ordered

cuts
to
reduce
a
crude
glut
meg

plummeted
percent
in

while

the
bid
reflected
husky
s
strategy
to
double
down
on
heavy
oil
production
even
though
clogged
pipelines
drove
down
canadian
prices
but
market
conditions
changed
dramatically
since
husky
s
september
offer
and
canadian
prices
surged
this
month
after
the
provincial
government
ordered
temporary
production
cuts
in
a
statement
husky
said
the
government
intervention
and
a
lack
of
progress
on
expanding
pipelines
hurt
the
business
and
economic
while
production
cuts
have
helped
some

integrated
companies
like
husky
previously
benefited
from
processing
cheap
oil
in
its
refineries
alberta
s
move
and
declines
since
autumn
in
global
crude
prices
likely
swayed
husky
not
to
extend
its
offer
and
try
to
complete
the
deal
