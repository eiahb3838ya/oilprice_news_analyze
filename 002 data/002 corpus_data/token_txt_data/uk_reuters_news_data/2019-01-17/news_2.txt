the
world
has
made
far
too
little
progress
on
the
global
goals
governments
agreed
in
to
end
poverty
and
hunger
and
tackle
climate
change
with
a
rising
tide
of
nationalism
acting
as
a
wrecking
ball
architects
of
the
goals
said
on
thursday
helen
clark
a
former
new
zealand
prime
minister
who
headed
the
united
nations
development
programme
from
said
the
on
the
sustainable
development
goals
sdgs
due
to
be
met
by
has
gone
under
the
radar
there
has
been
a
lot
of
lip
service
but
not
enough
action
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
on
the
sidelines
of
a
debate
on
how
to
meet
the
global
goals
hosted
by
the
spanish
government
for
example
the
number
of
hungry
people
in
the
world
has
gone
up
three
years
in
a
row
after
falling
which
clark
said
was
undoubtedly
related
to
climate
change
and
displacement
and
on
current
estimates
percent
of
the
global
population
or
close
to
half
a
billion
people
would
still
be
living
in
extreme
poverty
by
she
said
changes
in
the
world
s
political
landscape
have
also
made
the
goals
more
elusive
clark
said
the
unity
of
the
international
community
that
had
allowed
the
sdgs
and
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
to
be
adopted
in
had
been
shattered
by
a
shift
to
the
political
right
in
countries
such
as
the
united
states
and
brazil
sealing
those
deals
would
no
longer
be
possible
today
because
of
the
disruptive
impact
of
the
united
states
under
president
donald
trump
she
said
the
leader
has
given
notice
he
wants
to
pull
out
of
the
paris
accord
on
climate
change
and
refused
to
join
a
new
global
compact
on
migration
you
ve
got
a
major
country
missing
in
action
and
that
takes
the
pressure
off
others
to
act
including
china
and
india
clark
said
both
are
still
investing
in
power
plants
despite
signalling
a
shift
away
from
dirty
energy
she
added
jeffrey
sachs
a
economics
professor
who
advised
governments
and
the
united
nations
on
the
sdgs
said
nothing
had
happened
at
the
global
level
in
the
past
three
years
somehow
we
re
trying
to
make
a
global
change
with
no
one
in
charge
he
told
the
madrid
event
sachs
director
of
the
un
sustainable
development
solutions
network
blamed
slow
movement
on
the
sdgs
and
the
paris
agreement
on
a
dearth
of
leadership
the
unfairness
of
the
economic
system
and
the
lack
of
a
plan
for
putting
the
agenda
into
practice
he
pointed
to
the
world
s
billionaires
whose
wealth
adds
up
to
about
trillion
and
called
for
a
tax
of
at
least
percent
on
the
net
worth
of
those
individuals
which
he
said
would
raise
close
to
billion
per
year
to
get
education
to
every
child
on
the
planet
both
sachs
and
clark
said
the
problem
lay
not
with
a
lack
of
solutions
to
the
world
s
ills
whether
using
clean
energy
or
getting
basic
services
to
those
in
need
but
governments
abdication
of
responsibility
towards
citizens
many
of
whom
are
trying
to
push
ahead
sachs
said
change
would
eventually
happen
the
world
would
end
up
with
wind
and
solar
power
as
the
basis
of
its
energy
system
in
the
middle
of
the
century
while
everyone
would
be
driving
electric
vehicles
in
years
for
example
i
guarantee
we
going
to
do
the
right
thing
at
some
point
he
said
it
obvious
but
how
hard
it
is
to
move
