concern

dragged
stocks
lower
on
thursday
while
an
end
to
the
latest
chapter
in
the
brexit
saga
offered
sterling
a
moment
s
peace
fresh
big
news
was
thinner
on
the
ground
for
most
of
the
european
session
but
dealers
had
more
than
enough
to
digest
from
the
previous
hours
to
ensure
most
of
the
major

disappointing

hot
on
the
heels
of
similarly

numbers
from

earlier
in

meant
its

were
marked
down
percent
and

pointed
to

days
europe
s

tumbled
percent
after
france
s
societe
generale
issued
a
profit
warning
and
carmakers
skidded
as
much
as
percent
after
senate
finance
committee
chairman
charles
grassley
said
he
thought
president
donald

was
inclined
to
impose

hit
as
one
of
world
s
biggest
chip

taiwan

forecast
its
steepest
drop
in

in
a

there
is
some
focus
on
the
grassley
comments
in
relation
to
auto
trade
tariffs
and
also
reference
to
there
not
being
much

there
has
obviously
been
a
lot
of
optimism
in
markets
since
the
start
of
the
year
and
risk
appetite
has
had
a
pretty
good
run
but
this
will
place
a
few
question
marks
over
msci
s
broadest
index
of
world
stocks
was
fractionally
lower
having
hit
a
high
markets
like
japan
had
dithered
in
both
directions
while

pointed
to
wall

lower
some
took
heart
from
beijing
s
confirmation
that
chinese
vice
premier
liu
he
will
travel
to
the
united
states
on
for
more
negotiations
with
washington
but
it
wasn
t
enough
to
tip
the
balance
more
broadly
china
s
index
ended
down
percent
led
lower
by
a
decline
in
the

warned
of
slower

growth
as
the
economy
loses
steam
chinese
premier
li
keqiang
promised
increased
government
investment
this
year
and
the
central
bank
injected
more
cash
into
the
financial
system
bringing
the
amount
for
the
week
to
trillion
yuan
billion
stoking
additional
caution
however
was
news
that
lawmakers
introduced
bills
on
wednesday
that
would
ban
the
sale
of
chips
or
other
components
to
huawei
or
other
chinese
telecoms
firms
that
violate
sanctions
or
export

came
shortly
before
the
wall

journal
reported
federal
prosecutors
were
investigating
allegations
that
huawei
stole
trade
secrets
from
businesses
separately
handelsblatt
reported
the
german
government
is
actively
considering
stricter
security
requirements
and
other
ways
to
exclude
huawei
from
a
buildout
of
mobile
networks
also
lurking
were
worries
the
government
shutdown
was
starting
to
take
a
toll
on
the
economy
white

economic

kevin
hassett
said
the

would
shave

british
prime

nothing
has
