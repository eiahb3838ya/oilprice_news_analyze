analysis-see you in court, citizens tell governments on climate change
barcelona
jan

reuters
foundation
e
nvironmentalists
in
france
and
ireland
are
pushing
forward
with
legal
cases
aimed
at
forcing
their
governments
to
step
up
action
on
climate
change
motivated
by
a
flagship
ruling
that
the
netherlands
must
cut
emissions
faster
to
keep
its
people
safe
in
october
a
dutch
appeals
court
said
the
government
had
done
too
little
to
prevent
the
dangers
of
climate
change
and
is
doing
too
little
to
catch
up
ordering
it
to
ensure
emissions
are
at
least
percent
below
levels
by
the
end
of
tessa
khan
a
lawyer
with
the
urgenda
foundation
which
brought
the
dutch
case
on
behalf
of
nearly
citizens
said
this
and
other
ongoing
climate
legal
actions
are
based
on
the
principle
that
governments
must
meet
their
obligations
under
human
rights
law
and
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
these
cases
all
spring
from
the
same
sort
of
inspiration
and
the
broad
notion
that
our
governments
have
the
duty
to
protect
us
from
threats
of
this
scale
that
they
have
contributed
to
knowingly
said
khan
who
is
of
the
climate
litigation
network
in
france
four
groups
including
greenpeace
and
oxfam
fired
the
starting
gun
on
they
sent
a
preliminary
request
for
compensation
in
a
letter
to
the
french
prime
minister
and
a
dozen
government
ministers
denouncing
the
state
for
failing
to
take
concrete
and
effective
measures
to
combat
climate
change
the
government
has
two
months
to
respond
and
if
it
fails
to
give
a
satisfactory
answer
the
groups
are
preparing
to
file
a
full
legal
action
with
the
paris
administrative
court
in
march
armelle
le
comte
climate
and
energy
advocacy
manager
at
oxfam
france
said
the
ripple
of
lawsuits
on
climate
action
around
the
world
from
europe
and
north
america
to
pakistan
and
colombia
reflected
growing
urgency
as
the
impacts
of
extreme
weather
and
rising
seas
become
more
visible
governments
including
france
have
talked
a
lot
about
tackling
climate
change
but
have
not
done
enough
in
practice
she
noted
so
i
think
it
is
not
surprising
that
more
citizens
charities
and
ngos
decide
that
legal
action
is
maybe
the
answer
she
said
in
the
meantime
the
ngos
have
been
raising
awareness
about
the
case
and
the
need
for
stronger
climate
action
in
france
through
a
youtube
video
featuring
celebrities
such
as
actress
juliette
binoche
and
writer
and
film
director
cyril
dion
they
also
launched
an
online
petition
in
support
of
what
they
are
calling
the
case
of
the
century
that
has
garnered
nearly
million
signatures
in
about
a
month
le
comte
said
wide
public
support
for
the
legal
action
was
important
in
providing
a
sense
of
legitimacy
to
the
approach
the
case
is
particularly
poignant
in
france
which
has
been
rocked
in
recent
months
by
yellow
vest
protests
over
social
inequality
and
the
high
cost
of
living
that
were
initially
sparked
by
planned
hikes
in
fuel
tax
french
president
emmanuel
macron
launched
a
national
policy
debate
this
week
that
includes
how
the
country
could
shift
to
using
more
clean
energy
urgenda
s
khan
said
the
court
cases
were
aimed
at
ensuring
emissions
targets
are
met
not
telling
states
how
to
do
it
then
it
s
up
to
the
governments
and
the
public
to
make
sure
the
policies
that
are
put
in
place
are
ones
that
ensure
a
just
energy
transition
and
the
poorest
aren
t
the
ones
who
bear
the
burden
of
that
transition
she
said
oxfam
s
le
comte
said
the
case
of
the
century
social
media
campaign
was
meant
to
provide
more
information
especially
to
young
people
on
the
measures
that
could
be
taken
in
ireland
backers
of
the
climate
change
case
scheduled
to
begin
in
the
high
court
on
are
organising
a
children
s
rally
in
dublin
on
saturday
to
urge
leaders
that
must
be
the
year
of
ambitious
climate
action
about
members
of
the
public
have
backed
climate
case
ireland
with
online
messages
of
support
spokeswoman
sadhbh
o
neill
said
awareness
was
growing
in
the
country
which
has
among
the
highest
emissions
per
capita
in
the
european
union
that
helps
us
show
the
court
that
we
have
standing
that
we
re
not
doing
it
in
a
way
and
that
we
are
trying
to
be
representative
of
concerned
citizens
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
friends
of
the
irish
environment
a
company
set
up
by
environmental
activists
will
argue
in
the
case
that
the
government
s
approval
of
the
national
mitigation
plan
in
violated
national
legislation
on
climate
action
as
well
as
its
constitution
and
human
rights
obligations
it
will
also
claim
the
plan
falls
far
short
of
the
steps
required
by
the
paris
agreement
o
neill
noted
that
ireland
s
emissions
have
risen
since
as
its
economy
recovered
from
the
financial
crisis
and
its
dairy
industry
expanded
a
spokesman
for
ireland
s
department
of
communications
climate
action
and
environment
said
by
email
that
the
government
would
defend
the
case
but
noted
the
national
mitigation
plan
recognised
a
detailed
roadmap
would
be
required
to
decarbonise
the
economy
that
is
now
being
put
in
place
he
added
and
includes
a
climate
action
plan
intended
to
make
ireland
a
leader
in
responding
to
climate
disruption
the
verdict
in
the
irish
case
a
judicial
review
is
expected
to
be
issued
in
a
few
months
while
the
french
legal
process
could
last
two
to
three
years
le
comte
said
in
the
netherlands
it
took
three
years
for
an
initial
ruling
to
be
confirmed
by
the
appeals
court
and
the
government
said
in
november
it
would
request
a
review
of
the
judgement
khan
said
one
key
advantage
of
pursuing
states
in
court
was
judicial
scrutiny
of
the
evidence
on
climate
change
just
by
putting
the
facts
on
the
record
that
in
itself
is
a
really
important
communication
tool
and
helps
to
mobilise
the
public
around
climate
change
