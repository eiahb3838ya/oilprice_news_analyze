london
reuters
opec
cut
oil
output
sharply
in
december
before
a
new
accord
to
limit
supply
took
effect
it
said
on
thursday
suggesting
that
producers
have
made
a
strong
start
to
averting
a
glut
in
as
a
slowing
economy
curbs
demand
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
said
in
a
monthly
report
that
its
oil
output
fell
by
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
december
to
million
bpd
the
biggest
drop
in
almost
two
years
worried
by
a
drop
in
oil
prices
and
rising
supplies
opec
and
allies
including
russia
agreed
in
december
to
return
to
production
cuts
in
they
pledged
to
lower
output
by
million
bpd
of
which
opec
s
share
is
bpd
opec
secretary
general
mohammad
barkindo
told
reuters
that
producers
were
seeking
to
avoid
a
in
the
industrialised
world
s
oil
inventories
above
the
average
they
were
above
that
mark
in
november
figures
in
opec
s
report
showed
we
are
not
yet
out
of
the
winter
woods
he
said
the
oil
industry
can
not
afford
to
relapse
into
another
downturn
he
said
in
reference
to
a
oil
market
slump
the
supply
reduction
in
december
means
that
if
opec
fully
implements
the
new
cut
it
will
avoid
a
surplus
that
could
weaken
prices
oil
slid
from
a
barrel
in
october
to
less
than
in
december
on
concerns
over
excess
supply
opec
expects
global
oil
demand
growth
to
slow
to
million
bpd
from
million
in
though
it
was
more
upbeat
about
the
economic
backdrop
than
last
month
and
cited
better
sentiment
in
the
oil
market
where
crude
is
back
above
while
the
economic
risk
remains
skewed
to
the
downside
the
likelihood
of
a
moderation
in
monetary
tightening
is
expected
to
slow
the
decelerating
economic
growth
trend
in
opec
said
in
the
report
barkindo
added
that
he
remains
optimistic
that
healthy
demand
would
hold
this
year
the
supply
cut
was
a
policy
after
the
producer
alliance
known
as
agreed
in
june
to
boost
supply
amid
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
lower
prices
and
cover
an
expected
shortfall
in
iranian
exports
opec
changed
course
after
the
slide
in
prices
starting
in
october
a
previous
supply
curb
starting
in
january
when
opec
production
fell
by
bpd
according
to
opec
figures
got
rid
of
the
glut
the
group
confirmed
on
its
website
that
it
plans
to
meet
over
april
in
vienna
to
review
the
supply
cut
agreement
opec
sources
said
another
meeting
could
follow
in
june
the
biggest
drop
in
opec
supply
last
month
came
from
saudi
arabia
and
amounted
to
bpd
the
report
showed
saudi
supply
in
november
had
hit
a
record
above
million
bpd
after
president
trump
demanded
more
oil
be
pumped
the
kingdom
told
opec
that
it
lowered
supply
to
million
bpd
in
december
and
has
said
it
plans
to
go
even
further
in
january
by
delivering
a
larger
cut
than
required
under
the
deal
the
was
an
involuntary
cut
by
libya
where
unrest
led
to
the
shutdown
of
the
country
s
biggest
oilfield
iran
registered
the
decline
in
output
also
involuntary
as
sanctions
that
started
in
november
discouraged
companies
from
buying
its
oil
iran
libya
and
venezuela
are
exempt
from
the
supply
pact
and
are
expected
by
some
analysts
to
post
further
falls
giving
a
tailwind
to
the
voluntary
effort
by
the
others
opec
said
in
the
report
that
demand
for
its
crude
would
decline
to
million
bpd
a
drop
of
bpd
from
as
rivals
pump
more
and
the
slowing
economy
curbs
demand
delivering
the
bpd
cut
from
december
s
level
should
mean
the
group
would
be
pumping
slightly
less
than
the
expected
demand
for
its
crude
this
year
and
so
avoid
a
surplus
last
month
s
report
had
pointed
to
a
surplus
the
figures
for
opec
production
and
demand
for
its
crude
were
lowered
by
about
bpd
to
reflect
qatar
s
exit
from
the
group
which
now
has
