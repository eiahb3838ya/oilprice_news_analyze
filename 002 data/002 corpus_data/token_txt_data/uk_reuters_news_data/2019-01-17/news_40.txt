dutch citizens demand end to quake-hit groningen gas production
the

reuters
angry
dutch
citizens
on
thursday
will
ask
their
country
s
highest
court
to
put
an
immediate
end
to
gas
production
in
the
groningen
region
due
to
the
risk
of
earthquakes
decades
of
extraction
from
what
once
was
europe
s
largest
natural
gas
field
have
led
to
dozens
of
minor
tremors
every
year
damaging
thousands
of
homes
and
sparking
unrest
among
locals
an
unusually
severe
magnitude
quake
prompted
the
dutch
government
last
year
to
decide
to
end
production
by
and
to
lower
it
as
quickly
as
possible
in
coming
years
gas
production
at
groningen
is
run
by
nam
a
joint
venture
between
royal
dutch
shell
and
exxon
mobil
output
is
set
to
drop
to
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
in
the
year
that
began
in
october
down
percent
from
its
peak
and
will
be
cut
by
another
percent
in
the
next
five
years
the
government
said
in
december
but
many
in
the
region
still
feel
their
safety
concerns
are
being
ignored
as
tremors
are
expected
to
continue
while
numerous
attempts
to
set
up
a
compensation
scheme
for
damage
and
repairs
have
failed
the
dutch
high
court
last
week
said
it
would
hear
two
pressing
objections
to
the
government
s
production
plans
on
thursday
while
other
complaints
from
local
authorities
and
interest
groups
would
be
dealt
with
in
april
the
petitioners
demand
drilling
be
stopped
immediately
or
at
least
capped
at
bcm
per
year
a
level
the
dutch
gas
regulator
last
year
said
would
limit
risks
a
sudden
halt
to
output
would
put
the
netherlands
in
a
tight
spot
as
the
country
still
depends
on
groningen
gas
for
a
significant
part
of
its
energy
supply
and
export
obligations
the
high
court
in
said
certainty
of
supply
should
play
a
role
in
decisions
on
the
production
level
but
should
not
outweigh
safety
concerns
the
court
expects
to
take
a
few
weeks
to
reach
a
verdict
