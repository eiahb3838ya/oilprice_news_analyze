update 1-dutch citizens demand end to quake-hit groningen gas production
the
hague
reuters
angry
dutch
citizens
on
thursday
asked
their
country
s
highest
court
to
put
an
immediate
end
to
natural
gas
production
in
the
groningen
region
due
to
the
risk
of
earthquakes
once
europe
s
largest
gas
field
decades
of
extraction
have
led
to
dozens
of
minor
tremors
every
year
damaging
thousands
of
homes
and
sparking
unrest
among
locals
and
prompting
authorities
to
impose
caps
on
activity
at
groningen
seismic
risks
are
still
increasing
all
we
hear
are
promises
of
future
improvements
but
nothing
s
really
happening
resident
and
politician
nette
kruzenga
said
in
court
an
unusually
severe
magnitude
quake
prompted
the
dutch
government
last
year
to
pledge
to
end
production
by
and
to
lower
it
as
quickly
as
possible
in
coming
years
groningen
is
run
by
nam
a
joint
venture
between
royal
dutch
shell
and
exxon
mobil
output
is
set
to
drop
to
billion
cubic
meters
bcm
in
the
year
that
began
in
october
down
from
a
peak
of
bcm
it
will
be
cut
by
another
percent
in
the
next
five
years
the
government
has
said
production
has
already
been
lowered
to
the
lowest
possible
level
state
lawyer
hans
besselink
said
in
court
on
thursday
further
reductions
would
lead
to
shortages
at
companies
in
the
netherlands
and
but
many
in
the
region
still
feel
their
safety
concerns
are
being
ignored
as
tremors
are
expected
to
continue
while
numerous
attempts
to
set
up
a
compensation
scheme
for
damage
and
repairs
have
failed
the
petitioners
demand
drilling
be
stopped
immediately
or
at
least
capped
at
bcm
per
year
a
level
the
dutch
gas
regulator
last
year
said
would
limit
risks
we
need
two
to
three
years
to
get
at
bcm
it
s
impossible
to
reach
it
straight
away
without
disrupting
consequences
besselink
said
the
government
expects
the
bcm
level
might
be
reached
by
the
end
of
by
switching
large
industrial
users
away
from
groningen
gas
and
by
building
extra
capacity
to
convert
imported
gas
to
the
gas
needed
for
the
dutch
network
the
netherlands
still
depends
on
groningen
gas
for
a
significant
part
of
its
energy
supply
and
export
obligations
the
high
court
in
said
certainty
of
supply
should
play
a
role
in
decisions
on
the
production
level
but
should
not
outweigh
safety
concerns
the
court
expects
to
deliver
its
verdict
on
it
will
also
hear
other
complaints
from
local
authorities
and
interest
groups
