five
feet
of
snow
in
the
sierra
nevada
mountains
this
week
besides
triggering

and
mudslides
officials
said
forecasters
expect
the
bitter
weather
to
push
eastwards
into
the
rockies
and
midwest
through
the

struck
by
a
tree
uprooted
by
the
wind
and
rain
that
fell
on

high

gets
wetter

more
saturated
the

service
warned
police
in
los
angeles
and
santa
barbara
counties
ordered
evacuations
on
tuesday
from
areas
damaged

trigger
mud
and
debris
flows
on
charred
hillsides
the
snow

were
brought
by

a
second
larger
storm
arrived
on
wednesday
forecasters
said
both
are
expected
to
sweep
through
the
rockies

midwest
gathering
more
strength
from
moisture

mexico
forecasters
said
before

early
next

significant
road

as
storm
remnants
linger
said
marc
chenard
a
forecaster
with
the
nws
weather
prediction
center
in
college
park
maryland
the
risk
of
flash
flooding
and
rockslides
persists
he
said
some
areas
in
the
sierras
will
get
another
inches
of
rain
after
the
inches
that
already
fell
with
significant
snow
fall
above
the
weather
is
a
boon
for
farmers
and
ski
areas
however
as
most
of
california
is
recovering
from
years
of
drought
