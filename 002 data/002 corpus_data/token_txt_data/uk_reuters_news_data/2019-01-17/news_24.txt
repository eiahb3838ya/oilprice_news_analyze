nuclear
power
failed
to
find
private
investors
for
its
plan
to
build
a
plant
at
wylfa
in
anglesey
wales
which
was
expected
to
provide
about
percent
of
britain
s
electricity
we
ve
made
the
decision
to
freeze
the
project
from
the
economic
standpoint
as
a
private

it

toshiaki
higashihara
said
hitachi
could
seek
to
withdraw
completely
from
the
project
and
sell
the
horizon
unit
depending
on
discussions
with
the
british
government
hitachi
shares
have
risen
percent
since
japanese
media
first
reported
the
possible
suspension
last
week
the
japanese
company
had
urged
the
uk
government
to
boost
financial
support
for
the
planned
power
station
higashihara
however
denied
turmoil
over
britain
s
impending
exit
from
the
european
union
had
any
impact
on
hitachi
s
decision
to
freeze
the
project
people
close
to
the
matter
had
previously
said
it
had
limited
the
government
s
capacity
to
devise
plans
the
withdrawal
of
the
japanese
conglomerate
could
leave
the
nuclear
newbuild
industry
open
to
russian
and
chinese
companies

china

told

it
would
bring
forward
plans
to
build
a
nuclear
plant
in
bradwell
eastern
england
helping
to
plug
a
potential
supply
gap
british
energy
secretary
greg
clark
said
the
government
would
explore
different
options
for
funding
new
nuclear
plants
as
costs
for
renewable
energy
had
fallen
so
sharply
it
was
difficult
to
justify
higher
subsidies
one
option
is
a
regulated
model
under
which
investors
receive
some
of
the
funding
for
projects
as
they
are
developed
rather
than
the
model
which
provides
funding
only
when
electricity
generation
has
begun
the
government
will
give
an
update
on
this
assessment

summer

new
