germany should stick to nord stream 2 project - msc chairman
berlin
reuters
germany
should
finish
the
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
despite
opposition
and
growing
domestic
concerns
but
future
energy
projects
should
be
coordinated
by
the
european
union
a
veteran
german
diplomat
said
on
thursday
wolfgang
ischinger
chairman
of
the
munich
security
conference
said
the
initial
birth
defect
of
the
billion
project
was
the
fact
that
european
treaties
had
allowed
the
german
government
to
deem
the
project
as
purely
commercial
in
fact
he
told
reporters
it
was
clear
that
such
a
large
project
clearly
had
a
political
nature
particularly
given
russia
s
annexation
of
the
crimea
region
of
ukraine
in
and
other
actions
in
recent
years
the
pipeline
which
would
carry
gas
straight
to
germany
under
the
baltic
sea
has
been
criticized
in
some
quarters
because
it
would
deprive
ukraine
of
lucrative
gas
transit
fees
potentially
making
kiev
more
vulnerable
in
the
future
germany
and
russia
have
been
at
odds
since
moscow
annexed
crimea
but
both
countries
have
a
common
interest
in
the
pipeline
which
will
double
capacity
of
the
current
route
russian
gas
giant
gazprom
is
building
the
project
jointly
with
western
partners

and

ischinger
cautioned
against
abandoning
the
project
as
it
neared
its
completion
date
of
late
citing
german
foreign
policy
s
focus
on
consistency
and
sustainability
saying
forget
it
now
would
not
be
good
german
foreign
the
ambassador
in
berlin
richard
grenell
drew
fire
this
week
for
telling
german
companies
involved
in
the
project
that
they
could
face
sanctions
if
they
continued
with
the
plan
that
is
already
far
advanced
germany
says
sanctions
against
nord
stream
would
be
the
wrong
way
to
solve
the
dispute
