refile-update 1-as uber bows out to grab, drivers and riders bemoan loss of choice
singapore
reuters
a
mix
of
concern
and
disappointment
met
uber
technologies
inc
s
deal
to
sell
its
southeast
asian
business
to
bigger
regional
rival
grab
as
drivers
and
users
of
the
firms
took
in
the
prospect
of
sharply
reduced
competition
the
services
throughout
asia
have
long
relied
on
discounts
and
promotions
for
consumers
and
incentives
for
drivers
which
made
for
tough
competition
pushing
down
profit
margins
grab
said
the
uber
acquisition
accelerated
its
path
to
profitability
in
its
core
transport
business
as
it
would
become
the
most
southeast
asian
platform
while
drivers
were
split
on
which
of
the
two
services
offered
better
compensation
they
generally
expected
fares
to
go
up
with
the
reduced
competition
rennu
mahajan
who
has
driven
a
combined
years
for
both
companies
in
singapore
said
some
of
her
driver
friends
were
concerned
because
now
they
would
not
be
able
to
switch
to
the
other
app
but
i
am
personally
not
worried
i
am
quite
confident
that
the
fares
will
go
up
if
incentives
don
t
go
up
fares
will
increase
and
we
will
still
get
a
little
bit
more
said
mahajan
on
its
singapore
website
grab
said
passengers
could
expect
better
service
with
more
drivers
and
transport
options
available
on
one
app
and
that
fares
would
not
change
for
drivers
it
said
the
benefits
and
incentives
structure
remained
the
same
however
following
a
similar
merger
between
grab
investor
didi
chuxing
and
china
s
uber
business
in
driver
numbers
dropped
dramatically
as
subsidies
lapsed
and
new
regulations
raised
residence
requirements
for
drivers
in
the
year
following
didi
chuxing
s
acquisition
driver
response
rates
fell
between
and
percent
in
major
chinese
cities
according
to
didi
chuxing
s
data
according
to
mobile
data
analytics
firm
app
annie
grab
was
ranked
fifth
among
top
apps
based
on
monthly
active
users
in
singapore
in
versus
uber
at
no
in
indonesia
was
at
no
just
ahead
of
grab
whether
the
merger
would
eliminate
competition
in
singapore
will
be
the
focus
of
government
review
a
spokeswoman
for
the
land
transport
authority
said
we
will
ensure
that
no
one
single
market
player
dominates
the
sector
to
the
detriment
of
commuters
and
drivers
she
said
malaysia
s
land
transport
authority
issued
a
similar
statement
saying
it
will
work
closely
with
relevant
consumer
and
various
regulatory
agencies
such
as
the
malaysia
competition
commission
to
safeguard
passengers
from
unfair
terms
for
both
ricky
tan
who
has
driven
for
uber
in
singapore
for
over
a
year
and
andre
pereira
who
uses
both
services
grab
s
ability
to
exert
greater
control
on
prices
was
cause
for
concern
as
it
may
drive
away
customers
to
public
transport
as
the
only
app
left
grab
can
easily
increase
prices
pereira
said
while
there
are
smaller
apps
in
each
market
grab
and
uber
have
a
presence
across
the
region
while
indonesia
s
popular
only
operates
within
its
home
country
drivers
in
cambodia
one
of
the
last
frontiers
in
the
battle
of
apps
say
competition
is
fierce
and
the
market
will
not
be
easy
for
grab
a
lot
of
people
are
used
to
using
uber
grab
isn
t
strong
yet
uber
is
stronger
grab
just
arrived
said
krem
sokhom
the
apps
have
also
grown
in
popularity
in
countries
with
fewer
public
transportation
options
such
as
vietnam
le
minh
quan
who
drives
with
both
grab
and
uber
in
vietnam
said
without
competition
they
could
enforce
higher
commission
or
reduce
their
support
and
that
s
worrying
before
we
had
a
choice
but
now
we
don
banker
le
hoang
ngan
also
uses
both
whoever
gives
me
discount
codes
i
ll
go
with
it
if
not
i
ll
skip
so
one
down
will
just
give
me
less
option
he
said
in
thailand
services
by
privately
owned
vehicles
are
illegal
but
many
drivers
work
with
both
uber
and
grab
there
was
no
shortage
of
drivers
and
riders
who
liked
the
service
that
grab
had
to
offer
grab
provides
enough
promotions
for
my
liking
and
even
if
sometimes
they
don
t
i
don
t
mind
paying
the
full
price
said
choltanutkun
a
magazine
writer
who
said
she
preferred
grab
s
services
and
relied
on
it
in
her
everyday
life
i
prefer
convenience
and
what
s
the
quickest
created
