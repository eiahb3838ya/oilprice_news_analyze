last
year
analysts
and
traders
told
reuters
aided
by
an
expected
regular
monsoon
this
year
that
should
boost
demand
in
the
world
s
oil
consumer
for
diesel
used
in
harvesting
and
other
farming
leading
to
higher
rural
spending
barring
extreme
events
and
expecting
a
continuation
in
good
gdp
gross
domestic
product
growth
accompanied
by
an
average
monsoon
india
s
diesel
consumption
should
be
up
to
about
million
tonnes
towards
the
end
of
the
year
said
sukrit
vijayakar
director

trifecta
energy
strong
growth
would
end
two
choppy
years
which
saw
consumption
dented
by
a
surprise
demonetization
programme
launched
by
india
s
government
that
crimped
public
spending
after
the
most
commonly
used
bank
notes
were
removed
from
circulation
at
virtually
no
notice
india
s
average
monthly
diesel
consumption
was
about
million
tonnes
or
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
that
was
up
about
percent
from
when
average
monthly
consumption
was
million
tonnes
demand
for
the
industrial
fuel
in
asia
s

is

in

year
indians
will
also
go
to
the

in

by

next

bullish
factors
to
look
forward
to
in
regards
to
indian
gasoil
include
solid
economic
growth
with
special
emphasis
towards
rural
development
improving
activities
an
uptick
in
the

sector
and
not

the
upcoming

said
sri
paravaikkarasu
head
of
east
of
suez
oil
at

fge
meanwhile
an
expected
plentiful
monsoon
would
boost
agricultural
expansion
as
seasonal
rainfall
is
likely
to
be
unaffected
by
an
el
nino
weather
pattern
forecast
to
set
in
after
the
rainy
season
ends
in
september
in
the
absence
of
rain
diesel
will
be
used
for
power
generation
however
a
good
rainfall
will
mean
that
diesel
will
be
used
a
lot
more
in
harvesting
vijayakar
said
india
guzzled
million
tonnes
of
diesel
in
january
and
february
up
percent
from
a
year
earlier
recent
government
data
showed
meanwhile
india
s
diesel
exports
in
february
were
up
percent
to
million
tonnes
election
spending
and
the
tendency
of
refiners
to
refrain
from
increasing
diesel
prices
during
this
period
will
particularly
support
the
fuel
s
demand
