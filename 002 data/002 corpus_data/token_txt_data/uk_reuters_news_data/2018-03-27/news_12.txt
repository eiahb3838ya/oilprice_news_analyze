the
suit
alleges
the

fuel
economy

obtained
only
by
turning

an
emissions

environment
the

thoroughly
studying

group
vehicles

not
manipulated
and
comply
with
all
respective
legal
requirements
the
spokesman
said
software
management
programs
to
manage
emissions
are
not
illegal
unless
they
are
designed
specifically
to
evade
pollution
tests
or
unless
a
carmaker
fails
to
disclose
their
existence
