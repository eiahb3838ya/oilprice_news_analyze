it

a

located

the
dep
said
it
must
approve
before
etp
can
resume
drilling
at
the
site
this
is
the

in
a
long
series
of
spills
by
the

that
have
slowed
its
construction
since
may
the
dep
said
the
project
had
inadvertent

or
spills
prompting
the
environmental
regulator
to
issue
notices
of
violation
officials
at
etp
were
not
immediately
available
for
comment
it
was
etp
s
second

into

between
gallons
in
the
area
in

the
dep
issued
a
notice
of
violation

earlier
spill
the
latest
release
comes
after
pennsylvania
utility
regulators
on
march
suspended
operations
of
etp
s
sunoco
mariner
east
liquids
pipeline
after
sinkholes
were
discovered
near
the
project
the
shutdown
of
mariner
and
delays
for
mariner
have
forced
shippers
including
range
resources
corp
to
find
another
home
for
their
liquids
and
is
likely
causing
more
ethane
to
be
rejected
into
the
region
s
natural
gas
pipelines
according
to
analysts
mariner
transports
up
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
propane
and
ethane
from
the
marcellus
and
utica
shale
formations
in
western
pennsylvania
to
customers
in
the
state
and
elsewhere
including
etp
s
marcus
hook
industrial
complex
near
philadelphia
the
sinkholes
were
near
the
area
where
construction
is
under
way
for
mariner
the
order
stopping
flows
on
mariner
did
not
affect
work
on
mariner
construction
of
mariner
which
started
in
early
was
originally
expected
to
be
completed
in
the
third
quarter
of
but
has
been
delayed
by
repeated
work
stoppages
by
pennsylvania
regulators
among
other
things
etp
has
said
it
expects
to
complete
mariner
by
the
end
of
the
second
quarter
once
complete
mariner
will
expand
the
total
capacity
of
the
mariner
east
project
to
bpd
and
open
the
pipe
to
suppliers
in
ohio
and
west
virginia
