reuters
germany
s
greenhouse
gas
emissions
fell
in
largely
thanks
to
the
closure
of
power
plants
but
and
factories
still
need
to
do
more
to
cut
pollution
government
officials
said
on
tuesday
overall
emissions
in
europe
s
biggest
economy
fell
percent
through
the
year
according
to
preliminary
data
released
by
a
federal
environment
agency
while
emissions
fell
significantly
those
in
transport
and
the
manufacturing
industry
went
up
the
umweltbundesamt
uba
said
in
a
statement
therefore
additional
measures
are
necessary
to
set
germany
on
a
course
toward
its
targets
the
energy
industry
which
is
undergoing
a
staged
transition
to
renewable
technologies
saw
its
emissions
fall
by
percent
or
million
tonnes
in
uba
said
but
transport
sector
emissions
rose
by
percent
to
million
tonnes
as
car
ownership
expanded
and
the
booming
economy
meant
more
heavy
vehicles
were
on
the
road
the
buoyant
economy
also
drove
up
emissions
from
refineries
steelmaking
and
chemicals
germany
has
already
had
to
abandon
a
target
of
cutting
emissions
by
percent
by
the
year
from
levels
the
current
reduction
is
percent
with
just
two
years
to
go
instead
government
is
now
aiming
for
a
percent
cut
by
and
has
promised
to
bring
in
a
climate
law
in
that
will
demand
more
from
lagging
sectors
the
car
industry
is
also
facing
the
prospect
of
restrictions
on
diesel
vehicles
in
cities
as
it
tries
to
move
on
from
a
scandal
in
which
volkswagen
admitted
to
cheating
emissions
tests
emissions
from
europe
s
biggest
economy
totalled
million
tonnes
of
carbon
dioxide
equivalent
compared
with
million
a
year
earlier
said
the
state
body
which
reports
to
the
economy
ministry
the
bulk
of
german
emissions
in
consisted
of
which
accounted
for
million
tonnes
accounting
for
a
percent
decline
from
million
a
year
earlier
some
million
tonnes
of
emissions
down
from
million
in
were
made
up
of
other
noxious
gases
monitored
by
the
uba
the
german
data
on
tuesday
were
estimates
only
based
on
usage
and
macroeconomic
data
and
may
well
change
uba
stressed
adding
it
will
publish
more
details
in
