sources
the
potential
consortiums

glencore

vitol
offer
the
local
bidders
financial
backing
that
would
otherwise
be
hard
to
secure
directly
through
international
banks
for
the
traders
a
deal
would
guarantee
access
to
crude
oil
for
many
years
they
would
then
be
able
to
syndicate
out
the
debt
to
banks
signing
up

industry
sources
in
nigeria
said
the
winner
of
the
petrobras
blocks
would
likely
be
a
local
company
due
in
part
to
government
pressure
while
the
government
already
has
local
content
laws
a
sale
so
close
to
the
presidential
elections
in

raised
pressure
to
secure
local
involvement
in
the
upstream
sector
this
has
made
it
more
difficult
the
sources
said
for
international
companies
to
bid
for
the

the
