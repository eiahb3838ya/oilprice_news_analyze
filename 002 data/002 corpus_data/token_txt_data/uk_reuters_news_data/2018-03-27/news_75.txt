china
met
its
carbon
intensity
target
three
years
ahead
of
schedule
last
year
the
official
xinhua
news
agency
reported
on
tuesday
citing
the
country
s
top
climate
official
xie
zhenhua
china
the
world
s
biggest
energy
consumer
cut
its
carbon
intensity
level
or
the
amount
of
carbon
dioxide
it
produces
per
unit
of
economic
growth
by
percent
in
xie
told
a
forum
in
shanghai
on
tuesday
carbon
intensity
fell
percent
in
compared
to
the
previous
year
xinhua
said
suggesting
that
china
s
war
on
pollution
also
helped
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
china
originally
promised
to
cut
its
carbon
intensity
by
percent
to
percent
the
pledge
first
made
in
was
included
in
the
country
s
commitments
to
the
international
community
ahead
of
negotiations
for
a
new
global
climate
pact
in
paris
in
however
china
struggled
to
honor
another
promise
to
establish
a
nationwide
emissions
cap
and
trade
system
by
with
the
scheme
delayed
by
technical
problems
including
the
reliability
of
emissions
data
the
country
eventually
settled
for
a
scheme
involving
only
the
power
sector
which
was
launched
in
december
last
year
in
his
speech
xie
said
the
national
market
though
only
at
an
embryonic
stage
already
covers
about
power
firms
with
total
carbon
dioxide
emissions
in
excess
of
billion
tonnes
making
it
the
world
s
biggest
he
said
china
would
continue
to
work
to
expand
coverage
to
other
industries
but
the
issue
has
been
complicated
by
the
decision
made
at
this
year
s
full
session
of
parliament
to
transfer
responsibility
for
climate
change
and
carbon
emissions
to
an
expanded
ministry
of
ecology
and
environment
it
was
previously
under
the
remit
of
the
state
planning
agency
the
national
development
and
reform
commission
ndrc
xie
was
formerly
of
the
ndrc
and
is
now
a
special
envoy
with
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
it
is
a
daunting
task
to
launch
china
s
national
carbon
trading
market
said
peter
corne
managing
partner
at
the
legal
firm
dorsey
whitney
in
shanghai
who
follows
china
s
environmental
policies
it
is
questionable
whether
in
the
short
term
the
new
ministry
can
be
elevated
in
status
and
power
to
the
extent
that
it
will
be
able
quickly
to
assume
the
influential
role
that
the
ndrc
occupied
in
the
area
of
climate
change
