the

we
are
studying
building
crude
storages
in
south
korea
and
also
japan
and
we
re
also
studying
options
to
have

iraq
plans
to
stop
loading
crude
from
its
southern
port
of
basra
for
three
to
four
days
in
early
april
due
to
maintenance
he
said
during
the
halt
of
loading
operations
at
basra
port
iraq
will
divert
production
to
storage
depots
in
south
once
the
maintenance
work
is
done
it
will
pump
at
maximum
capacity
to
make
up
the
shortfall
opec
s
producer
after
saudi
arabia
iraq
exports
most
of
its
crude
from
the
basra
region
on
the
gulf
the
basra
port
loading
capacity
is
estimated
at
around
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
iraq
has
million
barrels
in
oil
storage
capacity
in
the
southern
region
yasiri
said
iraq
s
crude
output
should
not
exceed
million
barrels
per
day
in
compliance
with
a
deal
between
oil
exporting
nations
to
curb
supply
in
order
to
lift
prices
he
also
said
march
oil
exports
won
t
exceed
million
bpd
he
said
oil
exports
from
the
northern
kirkuk
fields
through
turkey
halted
since
october
could
resume
at
any
moment
as
talks
with
the
kurdistan
regional
government
which
controls
the
pipeline
are
ongoing
he
said
the
main
issue
hindering
the
resumption
of
exports
to
turkey
is
the
kurdistan
region
s
demand
that
the
central
government
in
baghdad
pays
debt
related
to
the
development
of
the
kurdish
oil
industry
infrastructure
he
said
in
parallel
the
iraqi
government
plans
to
build
within
six
months
a
pipeline
to
turkey
that
runs
in
territory
under
its
control
he
said
adding
that
offers
to
construct
the
facility
had
been
received
iraq
could
start
in
one
to
two
weeks
sending
crude
by
truck
from
kirkuk
to
iran
s
kermanshah
refinery
starting
at
a
daily
average
rate
of
bpd
he
said
the
swap
deal
agreed
at
the
end
of
between
tehran
and
baghdad
provides
for
iran
to
export
from
its
kharg
terminal
on
the
gulf
on
somo
s
behalf
the
same
amount
of
crude
it
receives
from
kirkuk
