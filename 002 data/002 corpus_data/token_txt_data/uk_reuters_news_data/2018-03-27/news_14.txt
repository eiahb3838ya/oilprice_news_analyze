macron lawmaker seeks parliamentary inquiry over arms sales to saudi-led coalition
paris
reuters
a
lawmaker
in
president
emmanuel
macron
s
party
is
asking
for
a
parliamentary
investigation
into
the
legality
of
french
weapons
sales
to
a
coalition
over
concerns
the
arms
are
being
used
to
kill
civilians
in
yemen
pressure
has
been
mounting
on
macron
to
scale
back
military
support
for
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
which
are
leading
the
coalition
fighting
the
houthi
group
that
controls
most
of
northern
yemen
and
the
capital
sanaa
the
conflict
has
killed
more
than
people
and
displaced
more
than
three
million
i
am
submitting
a
request
for
a
commission
of
inquiry
knowing
that
france
ratified
the
arms
trade
treaty
sebastien
nadot
a
lawmaker
elected
last
year
as
part
of
hundreds
of
new
parliamentarians
that
form
macron
s
majority
told
reuters
on
tuesday
on
the
question
of
french
weapons
being
used
against
civilian
populations
in
yemen
i
want
to
know
if
france
is
respecting
its
international
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
nadot
will
get
the
necessary
backing
from
other
lawmakers
to
set
up
the
inquiry
committee
the
move
by
nadot
is
surprising
in
that
macron
has
faced
little
opposition
in
parliament
since
coming
to
power
last
year
and
commands
an
overwhelming
majority
with
few
of
his
lawmakers
willing
to
question
the
executive
s
decisions
unlike
many
of
its
allies
french
export
licensing
procedures
have
no
parliamentary
checks
or
balances
they
are
approved
through
a
committee
headed
by
the
prime
minister
that
includes
the
foreign
defence
and
economy
ministries
details
of
licences
are
not
public
and
once
approved
are
rarely
reviewed
parliament
must
be
able
to
control
whether
these
weapons
are
sold
in
respect
of
international
law
nadot
said
if
we
are
just
a
transmission
belt
and
not
a
body
of
control
and
evaluation
then
abstention
in
elections
has
a
bright
future
ahead
of
percent
of
french
people
want
macron
to
suspend
arms
exports
to
saudi
arabia
and
the
uae
a
yougov
poll
showed
on
monday
several
rights
groups
have
warned
of
possible
legal
action
if
the
government
does
not
halt
its
sales
france
is
the
world
s
third
biggest
arms
exporter
and
counts
the
two
countries
among
its
biggest
purchasers
while
some
european
countries
notably
germany
have
curtailed
ties
with
the
military
coalition
france
britain
and
the
united
states
have
not
followed
suit
