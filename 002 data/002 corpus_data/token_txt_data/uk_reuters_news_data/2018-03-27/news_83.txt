china
s
new
crude
oil
futures
contract
enjoyed
a
successful
first
day
of
trading
in
shanghai
most
likely
exceeding
the
wildest
hopes
of
its
backers
but
much
of
the
hard
work
of
building
a
viable
benchmark
still
has
to
be
done
the
new
contract
launched
on
monday
by
the
shanghai
international
energy
exchange
ine
attracted
interest
from
western
oil
traders
as
well
as
domestic
investors
some
million
barrels
of
oil
changed
hands
on
the
first
day
with
the
first
deal
going
to
global
trader
glencore
and
other
participants
included
major
merchants
trafigura
freepoint
commodities
and
mercuria
at
one
stage
the
volume
of
trades
being
done
on
the
ine
exceeded
those
in
global
rivals
brent
and
west
texas
intermediate
wti
the
evident
enthusiasm
for
the
new
contract
would
have
pleased
the
ine
it
aims
to
establish
a
third
global
benchmark
in
china
the
world
s
largest
crude
buyer
with
imports
averaging
just
over
million
barrels
per
day
for
the
first
two
months
of
on
the
surface
there
is
no
reason
why
the
ine
contract
shouldn
t
take
its
place
alongside
brent
and
wti
it
s
a
far
more
useful
marker
for
china
and
for
the
rest
of
asia
as
well
given
the
seven
grades
of
crude
accepted
for
delivery
are
heavier
and
more
sour
than
the
light
grades
that
make
up
brent
and
wti
this
means
the
ine
contract
better
reflects
the
type
of
crudes
that
are
more
typically
consumed
in
china
and
in
other
major
regional
importers
such
as
india
japan
and
south
korea
it
s
precisely
this
advantage
that
will
really
need
to
be
honed
if
the
first
day
s
success
is
to
be
carried
forward
in
effect
the
ine
contract
is
a
sort
of
chinese
mirror
of
the
already
dubai
mercantile
exchange
dme
oman
futures
the
dme
contract
has
a
similar
gravity
and
sulphur
content
to
the
ine
equivalent
providing
an
opportunity
to
use
both
as
hedges
for
physical
purchases
as
well
as
arbitrage
plays
this
dynamic
is
likely
what
will
attract
and
retain
international
market
players
to
the
ine
as
it
will
allow
them
to
profit
from
any
opportunities
between
the
prices
for
cargoes
offered
by
the
dme
futures
and
delivered
to
china
cargoes
by
the
ine
the
difficulty
for
western
investors
in
the
ine
is
the
risk
of
interference
by
the
authorities
in
beijing
the
latter
have
a
track
record
of
changing
rules
and
regulations
for
commodity
trading
if
the
market
isn
t
behaving
in
their
desired
fashion
currency
risk
is
also
on
the
agenda
given
the
ine
is
settled
in
yuan
and
the
other
major
oil
contracts
are
in
dollars
there
are
other
challenges
for
the
ine
with
one
being
that
the
contract
is
only
traded
in
asian
hours
closing
at
local
time
or
gmt
this
excludes
london
and
new
york
traders
from
getting
in
on
the
action
in
their
own
time
zones
a
factor
that
may
hamper
liquidity
there
is
also
a
risk
of
different
expectations
of
the
various
participants
with
foreign
trading
houses
banks
and
oil
companies
seeking
hedging
and
arbitrage
opportunities
meanwhile
the
chinese
government
and
majors
may
be
seeking
market
control
and
the
ability
to
pay
for
crude
in
their
own
currency
another
factor
that
still
has
to
be
worked
out
will
be
how
much
of
the
volume
and
open
interest
is
held
by
professional
players
either
foreign
or
chinese
and
how
much
is
down
to
day
traders
and
other
investors
several
of
china
s
vibrant
commodity
contracts
are
dominated
by
smaller
players
which
can
exacerbate
swings
based
on
sentiment
or
momentum
without
too
much
based
on
market
fundamentals
but
none
of
these
problems
are
insurmountable
and
can
be
addressed
as
the
contract
build
ups
a
history
and
a
reputation
the
key
will
be
to
keep
an
eye
on
volumes
and
open
interest
as
a
measure
of
the
ine
s
success
