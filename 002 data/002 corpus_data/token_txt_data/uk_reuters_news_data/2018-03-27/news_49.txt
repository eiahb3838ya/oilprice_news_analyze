for
more
than
british
car
owners
kicked
off
a
lawsuit
against
volkswagen
in
london
s
high
court
on
tuesday
in
a
battle
for
compensation
over
a
diesel
emissions
scandal
that
has
engulfed
europe
s
largest
carmaker
since
the
hearing
will
determine
whether
the
claims
can
be
managed
collectively
under
a
group
litigation
order
glo
and
will
set
a
deadline
for
claimants
to
sign
up
to
what
lawyers
say
could
become
the
largest
group
action
in
british
legal
history
volkswagen
has
said
that
about
million
cars
worldwide
and
million
in
the
uk
were
fitted
with
software
that
cheated
diesel
emissions
tests
designed
to
limit
noxious
car
fumes
and
carbon
dioxide
pollution
vw
agreed
to
pay
up
to
billion
in
the
united
states
to
settle
claims
from
owners
environmental
regulators
states
and
dealers
and
offered
to
buy
back
polluting
vehicles
but
it
has
not
reached
a
similar
deal
in
europe
where
it
faces
billions
of
euros
in
claims
from
investors
and
customers
in
the
worst
business
crisis
of
its
history
dubbed
dieselgate
british
law
firm
slater
and
gordon
which
represents
more
than
claimants
in
britain
alleges
that
vw
deceived
people
into
buying
cars
that
breached
emissions
regulations
by
installing
defeat
devices
illegal
engine
management
software
designed
to
mask
true
pollution
levels
the
lawyers
will
argue
that
vw
profited
by
lying
about
the
compliance
of
their
cars
and
betrayed
the
trust
of
consumers
who
thought
they
were
purchasing
a
car
that
met
emissions
standards
and
which
was
fit
to
be
sold
to
uk
customers
when
this
was
not
the
case
the
firm
said
in
a
statement
the
german
company
has
offered
to
fix
uk
vehicles

has
said
it
broke
no
british
laws
and
that
drivers
suffered
no
loss
german
and
british
vw
officials
were
not
immediately
available

comment
slater
and
gordon
said
it
had
surveyed
more
than
affected
car
owners
who
had
agreed
to
the
vw
fix
which
amounts
to
a
software
update
of
the
engine
management
system
over
percent
of
respondents
regretted
having
it
carried
out
the
lawyers
said
it
said
more
than
one
in
ten
car
owners
told
its
survey
that
vehicles
lost
power
at
high
speed
exposing
them
to
danger
after
vw
fixed
their
car
drivers
also
reported
poorer
fuel
efficiency
and
engine
power
