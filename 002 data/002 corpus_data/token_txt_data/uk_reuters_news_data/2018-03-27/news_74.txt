stock
markets
jumped
and
the
dollar
fell
on
tuesday
as
reports
that
the
united
states
and
china
were
negotiating
to
avert
a
trade
war
whetted
investors
appetite
for
riskier
assets
the
euro
rose
to
a
five
week
high
against
the
currency
and
japan
s
nikkei
share
index
enjoyed
its
best
day
in
almost
three
months
jumping
percent
the
reports
of
talks
between
washington
and
beijing
spurred
optimism
that
president
donald
trump
s
protectionist
shift
is
more
about
gaining
leverage
in
trade
talks
than
isolating
the
world
s
biggest
economy
with
tariff
barriers
that
would
stifle
global
growth
this
helped
offset
news
that
the
united
states
and
many
of
its
allies
were
expelling
more
than
russian
diplomats
in
retaliation
for
a
nerve
agent
attack
on
a
former
russian
spy
in

an

rally
that
began
late

where
shares
had
their
best
day
in
years
spilled
over
to
asia
and
then
europe
where
the
stoxx
index
was
on
track
for
its
best
day
in
seven
weeks
but
some
investors
were
not
rushing
to
recalculate
risks

agenda
he
can
flip
flop
quite
a
lot
said
lukas
daalder
chief
investment
officer
at
robeco
in
rotterdam
the
big
problem
is
how
long
will
it
take
before
new
tweets
and
headlines
that
will
change
the
sentiment
again
he
said
he
was
underweight

the

and
overweight
other
developed
markets
based
on
the
expectation
that
there

pledged
on

to
maintain

the
reaction
was
to
offload
both
the
yen

the

after
a
big
gain
on
monday
the

added
another

it
less

in
valentin
marinov
head
of

strategy
at
credit
agricole
said
that
the
easing
of
trade
fears
had
allowed
investors
to
on
whether
the
european
central
bank
would
tighten
monetary
policy
faster
than
expected
and
for
large
institutional
investors
to
resume
allocating
more
money
to
the
euro
zone
after
years
of
being
underweight
the
improved
mood
on
