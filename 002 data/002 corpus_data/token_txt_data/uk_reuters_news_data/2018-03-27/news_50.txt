reuters
stock
markets
jumped
on
tuesday
as
reports
that
the
united
states
and
china
were
negotiating
to
avert
a
trade
war
whetted
investors
appetite
for
riskier
assets
japan
s
nikkei
share
index
rose
percent
for
its
best
day
in
almost
three
months
while
a
percent
gain
by
europe
s
stoxx
put
it
on
track
for
its
best
daily
performance
in
seven
weeks
the
reports
of
talks
between
washington
and
beijing
spurred
optimism
that
president
donald
trump
s
protectionist
shift
is
more
about
gaining
leverage
in
trade
talks
than
isolating
the
world
s
biggest
economy
with
tariff
barriers
that
would
stifle
global
growth
this
helped
offset
news
that
the
united
states
and
many
of
its
allies
were
expelling
more
than
russian
diplomats
in
retaliation
for
a
nerve
agent
attack
on
a
former
russian
spy
in
britain
stocks
are
still
percent
below
their
january
peaks
and
some
investors
are
not
rushing
to
recalculate
risks
around
trump
s
america
first
trade
agenda
he
can
quite
a
lot
said
lukas
daalder
chief
investment
officer
at
robeco
in
rotterdam
the
big
problem
is
how
long
will
it
take
before
new
tweets
and
headlines
that
will
change
the
sentiment
again
daalder
said
he
was
underweight
emerging
market
equities
and
the
nikkei
and
overweight
other
developed
markets
based
on
the
expectation
that
there
will
be
more
trade
uncertainty
white
house
officials
are
asking
china
to
cut
tariffs
on
imported
cars
allow
foreign
majority
ownership
of
financial
services
firms
and
buy
more
semiconductors
said
a
person
familiar
with
the
discussions
chinese
premier
li
keqiang
pledged
on
monday
to
maintain
trade
negotiations
and
ease
access
to
american
businesses
the
surge
in
stocks
dragged
on
the
treasury
market
which
faces
a
record
billion
of
new
supply
this
week
yields
on
treasury
notes
inched
up
to
percent
but
remained
short
of
last
week
s
top
at
percent
in
currency
markets
the
early
reaction
was
to
offload
both
the
yen
and
the
dollar
helping
the
euro
to
an
early
gain
but
the
single
currency
later
went
into
reverse
after
data
showed
lending
to
euro
zone
companies
slowed
last
month
and
european
central
bank
governing
council
member
erkki
liikanen
said
underlying
euro
zone
inflation
may
remain
lower
than
expected
even
if
growth
is
robust
the
dollar
measured
against
a
basket
of
currencies
used
the
euro
s
weakness
to
rally
percent
to
bouncing
off
a
low
hit
on
monday
the
improved
mood
on
trade
earlier
pushed
china
s
yuan
to
a
year
high
and
gave
a
fillip
to
industrial
commodities
with
copper
and
iron
ore
bouncing
in
oil
markets
brent
crude
added
cents
to
a
barrel
daalder
said
there
had
been
no
clear
flight
to
quality
since
february
s
burst
of
equity
market
volatility
with
scarce
volatility
in
currencies
and
little
movement
in
treasury
yields
it
seems
to
be
that
the
has
lost
some
of
its
shine
as
the
safe
market
to
which
people
turn
when
things
get
rough
said
daalder
it
s
partly
the
uncertainty
in
the
itself
which
is
playing
