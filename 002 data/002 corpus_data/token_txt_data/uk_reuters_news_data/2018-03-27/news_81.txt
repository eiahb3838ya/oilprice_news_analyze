white

a

familiar
with
the
discussions
chinese
premier
li
keqiang
on
monday
pledged
to
maintain
trade
negotiations
and
ease
access
to
american
businesses
the
recent
escalation
may
have
simply
been
a
negotiating
tactic
that
will
end
in
a
compromise
wrote
analysts
at
jpmorgan
this
would
be
consistent
with
the
pattern
around
the
tariffs
and
is
the
interpretation
that
many
market
commentators
are
yet
they
warned
it
was
too
early
to
say
for
sure
given
president
donald
trump
has
had
deeply
held
views
on
fair
trade
for
decades
even
a
whiff
of
a
deal
was
enough
to
propel
wall
street

its
best
day
in

ever
the
dow
jumped
percent
while
the
s
p
climbed
percent
and
the
nasdaq
percent
the
sudden
bout
of
optimism
helped
offset
news
that
the
united
states
and
many
of
its
allies
were
expelling
more
than
russian
diplomats
in
retaliation
for
a
nerve
agent
attack
on
a
former
russian
spy
in
britain
the
surge
in

dragged
on
the
treasury
market

faces
a
record
billion
of
new
supply
this
week
yields
on
treasury
notes
inched
up
to
percent
but
remained
short
of
last
week
s
top
at
percent
in
currency
markets
the
reaction
was
to
offload
both
the
yen
and
the
dollar
as
appetite
for
riskier
assets
revived
the
yen
is
being
quietly
sold

looks

vulnerable
on

crosses
citi
analysts
said
in
a
note
against
the
euro
was
especially
sharp
as
the
common
currency
jumped
percent
overnight
to
stand
at
yen
that
allowed
the
dollar
to
bounce
to
yen
having
been
at
its
lowest
since
late
at
one
point
yet
the
currency
ran
into
selling
against
almost
everything
else
with
notable
breaks
by
the
euro
and
sterling
the
