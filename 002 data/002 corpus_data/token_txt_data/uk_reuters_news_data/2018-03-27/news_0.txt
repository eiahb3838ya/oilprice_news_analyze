britain plans deposit return scheme to curb plastic waste
reuters
britain
plans
this
year
to
introduce
a
deposit
return
scheme
for
drink
containers
to
increase
recycling
rates
and
slash
the
amount
of
waste
littering
the
land
and
sea
the
government
said
in
deposit
return
schemes
which
already
operate
in
denmark
sweden
and
germany
consumers
pay
a
deposit
when
they
buy
a
drink
which
they
redeem
once
the
container
is
returned
british
consumers
get
through
about
billion
plastic
drink
bottles
a
year
but
more
than
three
billion
are
either
incinerated
sent
to
a
landfill
or
left
to
pollute
streets
the
countryside
and
marine
environment
the
government
said
we
can
be
in
no
doubt
that
plastic
is
wreaking
havoc
on
our
marine
environment
killing
dolphins
choking
turtles
and
degrading
our
most
precious
habitats
environment
minister
michael
gove
said
in
a
statement
it
is
absolutely
vital
we
act
now
to
tackle
this
threat
and
curb
the
millions
of
plastic
bottles
a
day
that
go
unrecycled
he
said
adding
that
implementation
of
the
scheme
in
england
would
be
subject
to
consultations
later
this
year
the
consultations
will
focus
on
the
details
of
how
the
scheme
will
work
along
with
other
measures
to
increase
recycling
rates
a
possible
alternative
to
the
deposit
return
scheme
is
cash
rewards
for
returning
drink
containers
the
government
said
this
is
often
executed
by
a
network
of
reverse
vending
machines
through
which
a
plastic
or
glass
bottle
can
be
inserted
into
one
and
the
machine
returns
money
britain
has
managed
to
slash
the
use
of
plastic
bags
since
by
charging
pence
for
each
bag
