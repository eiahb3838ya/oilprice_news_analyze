saudi
arabia
and
russia
are
working
on
a
historic
pact
that
could
extend
controls
over
world
crude
supplies
by
major
exporters
for
many
years
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
told
reuters
that
riyadh
and
moscow
were
considering
a
deal
to
greatly
extend
a
alliance
on
oil
curbs
that
began
in
january
after
a
crash
in
crude
prices
we
are
working
to
shift
from
a
agreement
to
a
to
year
agreement
the
crown
prince
told
reuters
in
an
interview
in
new
york
late
on
monday
we
have
agreement
on
the
big
picture
but
not
yet
on
the
russia
not
a
member
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
has
worked
alongside
the
group
during
previous
oil
gluts
but
a
to
year
deal
between
the
two
would
be
unprecedented
top
opec
producer
saudi
arabia
recruited
russia
and
other
countries
to
help
drain
oversupply
when
oil
prices
collapsed
to
below
a
barrel
in
from
over
in
crude
has
since
recovered
to
but
output
from
shale
producers
has
capped
prices
this
is
all
about
whether
the
arrangement
is
a
expedient
to
deal
with
this
particular
crisis
in
the
oil
market
or
whether
it
reflects
a
realignment
in
world
oil
said
oil
historian
daniel
yergin
vice
chairman
at
consultancy
ihs
markit
opec
countries
want
to
find
a
way
to
institutionalize
this
relationship
rather
than
to
have
it
be
a
robert
mcnally
at
consultancy
rapidan
energy
group
said
riyadh
wanted
help
in
breaking
the
cycles
that
characterize
oil
markets
by
capping
crude
on
the
upside
as
well
as
by
helping
lift
low
oil
prices
history
shows
that
without
a
powerful
competent
coherent
disciplined
swing
producer
in
the
oil
markets
you
get
oil
prices
wild
volatility
of
the
sort
we
have
seen
in
the
past
to
years
and
that
saudi
arabia
and
russia
do
not
want
to
see
again
mcnally
said
he
said
that
would
require
russia
to
join
saudi
in
building
spare
production
capacity
to
use
when
prices
rise
too
much
a
pact
between
moscow
and
riyadh
would
effectively
russia
to
the
opec
cartel
while
strengthening
russia
s
hand
in
the
middle
east
where
the
united
states
has
long
been
the
dominant
news
of
the
potential
oil
alliance
came
at
a
time
when
the
two
have
been
working
to
cement
an
economic
relationship
despite
being
at
odds
over
the
conflict
in
syria
where
they
back
opposing
sides
riyadh
supports
rebels
fighting
syrian
president
bashar
s
army
while
russian
and
iranian
forces
have
backed
assad
meaning
that
russia
effectively
sides
with
iran
riyadh
s
regional
a
meeting
between
the
saudi
crown
prince
and
russian
president
vladimir
putin
on
the
sidelines
of
a
meeting
in
china
in
september
was
instrumental
in
bringing
russia
on
board
to
support
opec
oil
curbs
last
october
saudi
king
salman
became
the
first
saudi
monarch
to
visit
russia
providing
investment
and
political
support
for
a
russian
economy
battered
by
western
sanctions
it
is
a
very
important
strategic
development
helima
croft
at
rbc
capital
markets
said
of
a
potential
to
year
oil
collaboration
first
the
crown
prince
is
making
the
statement
not
the
oil
minister
one
more
clear
sign
that
he
like
putin
is
the
final
word
on
his
country
s
oil
policy
second
it
is
one
more
sign
of
the
major
reversal
in
relations
saudi
was
a
staunch
cold
war
ally
of
the
now
this
alliance
appears
to
be
thicker
than
oil
and
seems
to
be
driven
by
the
personal
affinity
between
putin
and
mbs
said
croft
the
crown
prince
predicted
that
world
oil
demand
would
not
peak
until
despite
advances
in
renewable
energy
technologies
and
the
electric
vehicle
in
an
attempt
to
end
saudi
arabia
s
reliance
on
oil
he
is
leading
a
push
to
diversify
the
saudi
economy
away
from
oil
and
gas
by
riyadh
plans
to
raise
funds
through
the
flotation
of
a
percent
stake
in
state
saudi
oil
company
aramco
time
is
running
out
for
an
initial
public
offering
this
year
but
the
crown
prince
said
the
ipo
could
still
take
place
at
the
end
of
or
in
early
depending
on
financial
market
conditions
saudi
oil
minister
khalid
said
last
week
that
documentation
was
ready
but
that
a
venue
for
the
ipo
had
not
yet
been
decided
the
new
york
stock
exchange
is
still
in
the
running
for
the
ipo
alongside
london
and
hong
kong
but
falih
said
there
was
a
risk
of
a
frivolous
legal
action
if
aramco
were
listed
in
the
united
states
