london
reuters
lawyers
for
more
than
british
car
owners
kicked
off
a
lawsuit
against
volkswagen
in
london
s
high
court
on
tuesday
in
a
battle
for
compensation
over
a
diesel
emissions
scandal
that
has
engulfed
europe
s
largest
carmaker
since
the
hearing
will
determine
whether
the
claims
can
be
managed
collectively
under
a
group
litigation
order
glo
and
will
set
a
deadline
for
claimants
to
sign
up
to
what
lawyers
say
could
become
the
largest
group
action
in
british
legal
history
volkswagen
has
said
about
million
cars
worldwide
and
million
in
the
uk
were
fitted
with
software
that
cheated
diesel
emissions
tests
designed
to
limit
noxious
car
fumes
and
carbon
dioxide
pollution
vw
agreed
to
pay
up
to
billion
in
the
united
states
to
settle
claims
from
owners
environmental
regulators
states
and
dealers
it
offered
to
buy
back
polluting
vehicles
the
company
has
not
reached
a
similar
deal
in
europe
where
it
faces
billions
of
euros
in
claims
from
investors
and
customers
in
the
worst
business
crisis
of
its
history
dubbed
dieselgate
law
firm
slater
and
gordon
which
says
it
represents
more
than
claimants
in
britain
alleges
vw
deceived
people
into
buying
cars
that
breached
emissions
regulations
by
installing
defeat
devices
engine
management
software
designed
to
mask
pollution
levels
the
german
company
dismissed
the
allegations
and
said
it
intended
to
defend
itself
robustly
it
said
it
had
broken
no
english
laws
that
british
drivers
had
suffered
no
loss
and
that
the
legal
proceedings
were
premature
and
unfounded
we
are
confident
of
a
successful
outcome
the
firm
said
in
a
statement
it
said
it
had
not
been
established
that
the
software
was
an
illegal
defeat
device
and
emphasised
that
the
situation
was
materially
different
the
vehicles
are
different
the
regulatory
environment
is
different
and
the
technical
measures
are
different
the
affected
vehicles
in
the
uk
do
not
cause
more
pollution
on
the
road
than
expected
it
said
volkswagen
has
offered
european
drivers
a
software
update
removing
a
mode
that
operated
when
cars
were
experiencing
test
conditions
slater
and
gordon
one
of
at
least
three
law
firms
acting
for
affected
vw
audi
seat
and
skoda
drivers
in
england
and
wales
alleged
that
the
software
fix
had
led
to
mechanical
problems
it
said
it
had
surveyed
more
than
affected
car
owners
who
had
agreed
to
the
vw
fix
some
reported
that
cars
lost
power
at
high
speed
had
poorer
fuel
efficiency
and
engine
power
and
that
cars
had
juddered
it
said
vw
said
the
survey
s
methodology
had
not
been
explained
and
that
it
was
in
the
financial
interest
of
respondents
to
allege
they
had
suffered
damage
we
have
implemented
the
technical
measures
in
over
vehicles
in
the
uk
and
in
over
million
vehicles
across
europe
and
the
overwhelming
majority
of
customers
with
these
vehicles
are
satisfied
it
said
lawyers
say
that
if
the
case
was
not
settled
it
might
not
come
to
trial
