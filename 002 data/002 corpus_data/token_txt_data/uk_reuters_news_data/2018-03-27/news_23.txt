reuters
eu
lawyers
gave
cautious
support
this
week
to
a
proposal
by
the
bloc
s
executive
to
extend
its
energy
market
rules
to
regulate
offshore
pipelines
including
russia
s
planned
euro
gas
line
to
germany
the
european
commission
was
within
its
rights
to
draft
the
amendment
according
to
the
opinion
seen
by
reuters
that
contradicts
critics
who
say
regulators
are
overreaching
it
adds
to
a
series
of
conflicting
opinions
from
eu
legislators
on
whether
the
bloc
should
have
a
say
over
the
nord
stream
project
to
pump
russian
gas
under
the
baltic
sea
to
germany
bypassing
traditional
routes
through
ukraine
the
project
is
backed
by
germany
which
approved
its
construction
on
tuesday
and
five
northern
european
firms
who
seek
access
to
cheap
russian
gas
to
offset
declining
dutch
production
eastern
european
countries
fear
the
pipeline
will
increase
dependence
on
moscow
and
undercut
eu
support
for
kiev
by
depriving
it
of
transit
fees
the
document
from
the
legal
service
of
the
council
of
the
european
union
the
body
where
eu
ministers
meet
follows
a
separate
opinion
this
month
that
rejected
the
commission
s
proposal
saying
it
may
breach
law
regulating
the
seas
the
new
opinion
dated
march
said
the
commission
has
the
legal
basis
to
make
the
proposal
but
took
issue
with
some
elements
of
the
draft
law
now
being
reviewed
by
eu
member
states
and
the
european
parliament
eu
lawyers
criticised
regulators
for
not
carrying
out
an
impact
assessment
saying
it
was
up
to
member
states
to
decide
whether
it
is
appropriate
and
does
not
go
beyond
what
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
objectives
provisions
for
exemptions
from
the
new
rules
for
existing
offshore
pipelines
from
third
countries
are
not
justified
or
limited
in
time
it
said
the
commission
last
year
proposed
the
changes
to
its
gas
directive
to
make
all
import
pipelines
subject
to
rules
it
says
aim
to
protect
the
bloc
s
security
of
supply
the
nord
stream
project
fully
owned
by
russia
s
gas
export
monopoly
gazprom
is
far
from
complying
with
those
rules
including
that
pipelines
not
be
directly
owned
by
gas
suppliers
and
capacity
be
made
available
to
third
parties
because
the
pipeline
would
begin
outside
of
the
bloc
s
jurisdiction
eu
officials
say
rules
may
need
to
be
negotiated
with
moscow
via
an
intergovernmental
agreement
igas
the
legal
opinion
also
says
that
if
the
rule
change
takes
effect
member
states
would
have
to
ensure
all
existing
igas
comply
and
the
eu
would
gain
powers
to
conclude
such
agreements
with
third
countries
