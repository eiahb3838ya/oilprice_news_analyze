khan
told

on

engro
did
not
address
the
prospect
of
renegotiation
in
a
statement
late
on
thursday
it
responded
to
the
minister
s
suggestion
of
impropriety
by
saying
the
bidding
for
the
contract
was
done
in
an
auditable
and
transparent
manner
adding
that
lng
imports
helped
ease
pakistan
s
crippling
electricity
shortages
the
rapid
adoption
of
lng
infrastructure
made
pakistan
one
of
the
industry
s
markets
in
asia
sparking
interest
from
the
world
s
major
energy
producers
and
traders
engro
pakistan
s
largest
listed
conglomerate
built
the
country
s
first
lng
terminal
in

has
said
it
will
begin
building
another
one
starting
in

it
was
not
immediately
clear
if
both
lng
contracts
the
petroleum

spoke
of
were
with
engro

it
was
the
only
company

named

two
operational
lng
terminals
one
built
by
engro
and
several
more
planned
prime
minister
imran
khan
s
government
came
to
power
in
july
riding
on
a
wave
of
rhetoric
sharif
was
sentenced
to
years
in
prison
this
year
following
his
removal
from
office
by
the
supreme
court
his
party
denies
all
charges
of
corruption
while
it
was
in
power
from
petroleum
minister
khan
made
no
direct
claim
of
corruption
in
the
lng
deals
but
said
the
contracts
gave
a
maximum
return
on
equity
of
up
to
percent
which
he
said
was
far
above
the
industry
standard
he
implied
that
the
government
would
take
further
action
if
it
is
not
satisfied
with
future
negotiations
with
engro
we
will
renegotiate
with
them
will
sit
with
them
will
talk
with
them
and
if
it
doesn
t
work
then
there
are
other
remedies
which
will
be
considered

shahid
khaqan
abbasi
who
became

led
pakistan
s
push
to
develop

outages
of
up
to
hours
per
day
denies
any
wrongdoing
party
officials
say
corruption
cases
against
sharif
and
other
officials
are
a
conspiracy
by
the
judiciary
and
military
to
bring
down
their
previous
government
the
army
and
courts
deny
any
interference
in
