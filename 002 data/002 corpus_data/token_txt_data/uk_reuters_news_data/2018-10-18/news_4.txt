china
imports

it
s
probably
not
the
kind
of
success
president
donald
trump
had
in
mind
but
his
trade
dispute
with
china
has
effectively
killed
off
the
burgeoning
energy
trade
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
china
s
imports
of
crude
oil
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
and
coal
have
slowed
to
a
trickle
amid
the
escalating
tariff
war
perhaps
the
irony
of
the
collapse
in
china
s
energy
imports
from
the
united
states
was
that
this
was
the
area
most
likely
to
deliver
trump
s
lowering
of
the
trade
deficit
between
the
pair
if
china
had
continued
to
buy
increasing
volumes
of
crude
lng
and
coal
this
would
have
been
far
more
effective
at
lowering
the
trade
deficit
than
trump
s
chosen
path
of
imposing
tariffs
on
billion
of
imports
from
china
crude
oil
imports
from
the
united
states
are
expected
to
have
dropped
to
zero
in
october
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
refinitiv
this
is
despite
crude
oil
not
being
on
the
list
of
billion
of
imports
from
the
united
states
that
china
has
now
subjected
to
tariffs
a
single
cargo
of
million
barrels
of
crude
is
headed
to
china
from
the
gulf
coast
and
is
scheduled
to
arrive
in
november
according
to
the
data
china
s
imports
of
crude
peaked
in
june
this
year
when
almost
million
barrels
or
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
arrived
in
the
first
nine
months
of
this
year
china
imported
about
bpd
from
the
united
states
representing
about
percent
of
its
total
crude
imports
similar
to
crude
no
cargoes
of
lng
are
scheduled
to
arrive
in
china
in
october
although
one
vessel
from
the
sabine
pass
lng
facility
in
louisiana
is
slated
to
arrive
in
november
in
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
ships
delivered
a
total
of
million
tonnes
of
lng
from
the
united
states
to
china
representing
about
percent
of
total
imports
according
to
the
data
exports
to
china
were
about
percent
of
total
shipments
of
lng
in
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
as
the
trade
dispute
with
china
escalated
lng
exports
appear
to
have
slipped
with
the
million
tonnes
shipped
in
september
and
the
million
tonnes
in
august
being
the
two
weakest
months
this
year
behind
april
s
million
tonnes
turning
to
coal
it
s
largely
the
same
story
as
for
crude
and
lng
with
exports
to
china
plummeting
after
growing
strongly
over
the
past
two
years
no
coal
is
scheduled
to
arrive
in
china
this
month
although
three
ships
are
due
in
november
with
one
of
the
cargoes
being
petcoke
according
to
the
data
coal
exports
to
china
have
mainly
been
coking
coal
used
in
although
a
number
of
ships
carrying
thermal
coal
used
in
power
stations
have
been
tracked
this
year
china
imported
million
tonnes
of
coal
in
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
representing
just
percent
of
the
country
s
total
imports
but
a
somewhat
larger
percent
share
of
exports
in
all
three
energy
products
china
is
a
bigger
share
of
exports
than
the
united
states
is
of
chinese
imports
this
suggests
that
china
may
well
find
it
easier
to
source
alternative
supplies
than
producers
will
find
other
buyers
the
speed
at
which
energy
exports
to
china
have
gone
from
hero
to
zero
may
also
be
surprising
especially
since
the
tariffs
on
coal
and
lng
were
only
recently
imposed
and
crude
is
still
this
may
make
it
tempting
to
think
that
china
will
be
able
to
rapidly
ramp
up
imports
of
energy
should
the
trade
dispute
be
resolved
but
the
risk
for
energy
exporters
is
that
markets
once
lost
are
difficult
to
recover
especially
if
your
customer
has
readily
available
alternative
sources
of
supply
