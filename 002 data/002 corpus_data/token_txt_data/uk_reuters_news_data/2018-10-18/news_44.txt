sapped

the

however

minutes
of
the

on

the

has
lost
just
under
percent
of
its
value
versus
the
dollar
over
the
last
three
weeks
the
minutes
from
the
fed
s
meeting
showed
every
fed
policymaker
backed
raising
interest
rates
last
month
and
also
generally
agreed
borrowing
costs
were
set
to
rise
further
despite
president
donald
trump
s
view
that
the
tightenings
have
already
gone
too
far
major
currencies
have
shown
limited
reaction
after
the
government
late
on
wednesday
refrained
from
naming
china
or
any
other
trading
partner
as
a
currency
manipulator
as
it
leans
on
import
tariffs
to
try
to
cut

deficit

soothing
investor
sentiment
in
asia
in
its
currency
report
the
treasury
department
said
a
recent
depreciation
of
china
s
yuan
currency
will
likely
exacerbate
the
trade
deficit
but
officials
found
beijing
appeared
to
be
doing
little
to
directly
intervene
in
the
currency
s
value
the
yuan
was
steady
at
per
dollar
in
the
offshore
trade
not
far
off
low
of
touched
in
august
but
some
investors
remain
wary
of
a
slide
towards
the
psychologically
important
level
of
to
the
dollar
the
continued
risk
of
a
fresh
bout
of
weakness
in
the
yuan
can
not
be
ignored
with
treasury
yields
beginning
to
creep
higher
again
