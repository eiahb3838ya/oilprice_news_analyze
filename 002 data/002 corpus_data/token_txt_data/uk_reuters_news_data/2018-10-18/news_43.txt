turkey
s
top
refiner
tupras
is
in
talks
with
officials
to
obtain
a
waiver
allowing
it
to
keep
buying
iranian
oil
after
washington
reinstates
sanctions
on
the
islamic
republic
s
energy
sector
in
november
industry
sources
said
the
united
states
is
preparing
to
impose
the
new
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
industry
after
washington
withdrew
from
a
nuclear
deal
between
tehran
and
other
global
powers
earlier
this
year
but
is
also
considering
offering
waivers
to
some
allies
that
rely
on
iranian
supplies
nato
member
turkey
depends
heavily
on
imports
to
meet
its
energy
needs
and
neighbouring
iran
has
been
one
of
its
main
sources
of
oil
because
of
its
proximity
the
quality
of
its
crude
and
favourable
price
differentials
turkey
has
already
made
efforts
to
cut
its
purchases
ahead
of
the
sanctions
but
would
prefer
to
keep
up
some
level
of
iranian
oil
imports
past
november
an
industry
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
they
would
like
to
be
able
to
continue
importing
cargoes
a
month
like
they
did
during
the
previous
sanctions
round
but
if
the
would
tell
them
to
stop
they
will
oblige
and
work
towards
achieving
that
the
source
said
a
tupras
spokeswoman
was
not
available
for
comment
turkey
s
energy
ministry
was
not
immediately
available
for
comment
turkey
imported
around
barrels
per
day
of
iranian
oil
in
august
and
bpd
in
september
compared
with
just
over
bpd
in
april
tanker
tracking
and
shipping
data
showed
and
in
the
first
two
weeks
of
october
turkey
has
purchased
three
million
of
iranian
oil
a
level
that
would
equate
to
about
bpd
if
it
made
no
other
purchases
this
month
asked
if
washington
was
negotiating
with
turkey
for
a
waiver
a
state
department
official
said
the
department
was
prepared
to
work
with
countries
that
are
reducing
their
imports
on
a
basis
on
monday
brian
hook
the
special
representative
on
iran
did
not
comment
directly
about
any
talks
on
waivers
with
turkey
but
he
told
reporters
countries
seeking
sanctions
relief
must
explain
their
specific
and
unique
circumstances
hook
said
those
conversations
were
private
but
he
added
the
state
department
was
trying
to
advance
our
national
security
goals
and
also
taking
into
account
the
needs
of
our
allies
and
partners
around
the
refiners
around
the
world
are
under
pressure
to
avoid
iranian
oil
purchases
because
they
want
to
maintain
their
access
to
the
financial
system
something
they
could
lose
if
they
flout
the
sanctions
indian
refiners
also
cut
imports
of
iranian
oil
purchases
last
month
in
a
sign
they
are
preparing
for
november
washington
s
plan
to
impose
sanctions
on
iranian
crude
could
strain
already
soured
ties
between
the
united
states
and
turkey
at
odds
over
a
host
of
issues
from
diverging
interests
in
syria
to
ankara
s
ambition
of
buying
russian
defence
systems
the
release
of
an
american
pastor
last
week
who
had
been
in
custody
in
turkey
for
two
years
could
signal
a
thaw
in
relations
between
the
two
nato
allies
as
trump
said
he
welcomed
an
end
to
the
harsh
relationship
the
countries
had
over
the
summer
but
turkey
has
been
vocally
opposed
to
the
sanctions
on
iran
and
has
said
it
will
not
cut
trade
ties
with
tehran
at
the
behest
of
other
countries
during
iran
was
turkey
s
top
crude
oil
source
accounting
for
million
tonnes
of
its
total
purchases
nearing
million
tonnes
followed
by
iraq
and
russia
