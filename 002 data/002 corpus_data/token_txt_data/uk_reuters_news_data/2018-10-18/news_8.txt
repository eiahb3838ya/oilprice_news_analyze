saudi
arabia
and
kuwait
will
struggle
to
resume
oil
production
from
jointly
operated
fields
any
time
soon
due
to
operational
differences
and
souring
political
ties
between
the
previously
close
gulf
opec
allies
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
the
two
countries
halted
output
from
the
jointly
run
oilfields
khafji
and
wafra
in
the
neutral
zone
more
than
three
years
ago
cutting
some

pressing
its

riyadh
to

saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
visited
kuwait
last
month
to
discuss
a
resumption
of
oil
output
from
the
zone
but
the
sources
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
as
they
are
prohibited
from
discussing
the
issue
publicly
said
the
talks
failed
to
move
the
two
countries
closer
to
a
deal
as
kuwait
resisted
riyadh
s
push
for
greater
control
of
the
fields
it
did
not
go
well
because
kuwaiti
sovereignty

riyadh
does
not
want
kuwaiti

to
apply

the

saudi

wanted
a
bigger
say
and
more
control
in
running
oil
operations
in
the
zone
prince
mohammed
met
kuwaiti
emir
sheikh
sabah
and
crown
prince
nawaf
but
the
visit
was
cut
short
from
the
originally
planned
two
days
to
just
a
few
hours
on
the
night
of
the
sources
said
adding
to
the
political
friction
were
tensions
between
the
two
countries
over
the
embargo
of
neighbouring
qatar
and
diverging
views
on
relations
with
saudi
arabia
s
iran
the
sources
said
kuwait
is
trying
to
mediate
the
embargo
which
is
being
led
by
saudi
arabia
and
the

bahrain
the

of

qatar
rejects
the
charges
kuwait
has
sought
to
maintain
neutrality
although
the
emir
s
efforts
to
mediate
the
rift
have
had
little
success
so
far
kuwait
which
has
a

also
maintained

iran
saudi
arabia
and
iran
back
opposing

in

wars
in
syria
and
yemen
in
a
move
that
may
further
complicate
relations

riyadh
kuwait
this
month
signed
a
defence
cooperation
plan
with
turkey
in
what
it
said
was
meant
to
strengthen
bilateral
ties
turkey
has
sided
with
qatar
in
the
gulf
row
and
its
relations
with
riyadh
have
been
strained
due
to
ankara
s
close
ties
with
iran
the
regional
situation
is
not
stable
so
every
country
should
think
how
to
protect
itself

a

of
the

parliament
told
reuters
oil
output
in
the
neutral
zone
which
dates
back
to
treaties
establishing
regional
borders
is
divided
equally
between
saudi
arabia
and
kuwait
the
wafra
field
is
operated
by
kuwait
gulf
oil
co
and
chevron
on

of
saudi
arabia
the
khafji
field
is
operated
by
state
oil
giant
saudi
aramco
and
kuwait
gulf
oil
tensions
have
been
simmering
since
the
last
decade
when
kuwait
was
angered
by
a
saudi
decision
to
prolong
chevron
s
wafra
concession
until
without
consulting
kuwait
in
saudi
arabia
closed
khafji
citing
environmental
issues
in
chevron
shut
wafra
citing
difficulties
in
securing
work
permits
and
materials
saudi
arabian
chevron
is
focused
on
supporting
operational
activities
to
maintain
readiness
for
production
restart
when
that
time
comes
a
chevron
spokeswoman
said
obviously
a
restart
depends
on
the
discussions
between
the
two
countries
but
we
re
ready
we
are
maintaining
the
equipment
we
have
put
a
lot
of
effort
into
keeping
the
pipelines
in
shape
and
keeping
the
key
wells
in
shutting
output
is
expensive
because
it
requires
investments
of
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
per
year
for
maintenance
sources
familiar
with
field
operations
said
the
neutral
zone
is
the
single
biggest
asset
in
the
world
which
was
deliberately
stopped
and
hasn
t
been
producing
for
three
years
one
of
the
sources
said
the
more
the
restart
is
postponed
the
more
it
will
cost
to
maintain
it
and
the
more
problematic
it
might
be
to
restart
the
fields
quickly
and
fully
he
added
industry
sources
from
both
countries
say
that
though
khafji
and
wafra
are
not
linked
geographically
an
agreement
to
bring
one
field
back
online
would
be
tied
to
the
other
