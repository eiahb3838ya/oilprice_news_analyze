abb
is
exploring
a
sale
of
its
power

business
people
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
representing
a
by
chief
executive
ulrich
spiesshofer
who
defied
activist
shareholders
to
keep
the
unit
two
years
ago
abb
is
examining
various
options
for
power
grids
its
but
business
three
sources
said
with
a
decision
likely
by
early
next
year
the
company
is
looking
at
separating
its
power
grids
business
one
source
said
a
sale
of
a
majority
is
the
preferred
option
at
moment
although
selling
a
minority
or
spinning
it
off
are
also
everyone
agrees
there
needs
to
be
changes
another
source
said
credit
suisse
and
investment
banking
boutique
dyal
co
led
by
former
goldman
sachs
banker
gordon
dyal
are
advising
abb
on
a
deal
for
the
unit
which
analysts
estimate
could
be
worth
around
billion
abb
declined
to
comment
management
and
advisers
are
examining
how
power
grids
could
be
separated
from
the
rest
of
abb
s
business
which
runs
from
industrial
robots
to
power
transmission
equipment
before
the
swiss
company
s
board
makes
a
decision
the
price
will
be
decisive
if
a
sale
creates
no
value
for
abb
there
will
be
no
deal
the
source
added
spiesshofer
in
october
rejected
calls
from
cevian
capital
abb
s
shareholder
to
separate
power
grids
which
sells
equipment
like
substations
and
transformers
to
utilities
cevian
had
argued
that
the
unit
lacked
synergies
with
the
rest
of
abb
s
business
and
that
the
company
s
conglomerate
structure
made
it
too
complex
to
run
efficiently
since
then
power
grids
has
only
slightly
improved
its
performance
its
relatively
low
profitability
compared
to
other
divisions
has
weighed
on
abb
s
share
price
which
recently
fell
to
its
lowest
level
since
december
the
company
s
share
price
remains
far
short
of
the
swiss
francs
which
spiesshofer
said
could
be
possible
if
the
company
retained
power
grids
and
the
level
which
cevian
said
could
be
achieved
by
abb
and
a
separate
listing
of
power
grids
together
it
s
been
almost
two
years
since
the
unfavourable
decision
to
keep
power
grids
and
the
share
price
has
developed
miserably
christer
gardell
managing
director
of
cevian
told
swedish
daily
dagens
industri
in
august
abb
must
stop
with
explanations
and
whitewashes
now
they
simply
have
to
deliver
shareholder
spiesshofer
who
has
led
abb
since
september
hinted
this
year
at
a
possible
separation
when
he
said
abb
s
current
organisation
was
not
cast
in
stone
power
grids
employs
people
and
had
sales
of
billion
last
year
it
had
an
operating
profit
margin
of
percent
during
the
second
quarter
a
decline
of
basis
points
from
a
year
earlier
and
outside
its
target
range
of
to
percent
if
a
deal
is
approved
abb
could
concentrate
on
more
profitable
areas
like
electrification
and
automation
the
company
could
also
be
interested
in
buying
general
electric
s
power
conversion
unit
the
first
source
said
infrastructure
funds
which
normally
invest
in
public
assets
like
toll
roads
and
airports
are
interested
in
acquiring
a
stake
in
power
grids
while
industrial
companies
including
possible
bidders
from
asia
could
also
enter
the
bidding
a
second
source
said
abb
had
been
in
discussions
with
china
s
state
grid
on
the
unit
in
the
past
but
no
deal
ever
materialised
