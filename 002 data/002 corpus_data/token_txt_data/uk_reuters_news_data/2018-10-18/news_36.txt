the

lost
just

versus
the

over
the
last
three
weeks
major
currencies
have
shown
limited
reaction
after
the
government
late
on
wednesday
refrained
from
naming
china
or
any
other
trading
partner
as
a

it
leans
on

report
the

department
said
a

officials
found
beijing
appeared
to
be
doing
little
to
directly
intervene
in

the
onshore
yuan
fell
to
as

as
at
one
point
the
lowest
level
since
january
last
year
but
some
investors
remain
wary
of
a
slide
towards
the
psychologically
important
level
of
to
the
dollar
the
continued
risk
of
a
fresh
bout
of
weakness
in
the

not
be
ignored
