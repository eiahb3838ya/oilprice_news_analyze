energy firms, green groups call for strong uk carbon price to keep coal at bay
london
reuters
energy
companies
and
green
groups
have
written
separate
letters
this
week
to
britain
s
finance
minister
asking
for
the
country
s
strong
carbon
price
to
be
maintained
to
prevent
a
rise
in
power
generation
and
greenhouse
gas
emissions
the
letters
to
british
finance
minister
philip
hammond
come
ahead
of
britain
s
budget
and
after
the
government
said
it
was
considering
four
carbon
pricing
options
for
britain
when
it
leaves
the
european
union
next
year
energy
companies
sse
drax
and
orsted
urged
the
minister
to
maintain
a
strong
carbon
price
which
they
said
had
been
a
fundamental
economic
incentive
for
lower
carbon
and
renewable
generation
to
replace
coal
power
plants
produce
double
the
carbon
dioxide
emissions
of
power
plants
the
three
companies
have
made
significant
investments
in
renewable
power
generation
in
britain
and
drax
has
recently
announced
plans
to
buy
a
group
of
scottish
gas
hydro
and
pumped
storage
power
plants
from
spain
s
iberdrola
however
some
industrial
groups
have
warned
against
high
carbon
prices
in
britain
saying
it
brings
higher
electricity
prices
and
harms
the
country
s
competitiveness
britain
s
carbon
price
is
currently
made
up
of
two
levies
a
domestic
carbon
tax
set
at
pounds
per
ton
paid
on
top
of
obligations
under
the
european
emissions
trading
system
which
forces
companies
to
surrender
one
carbon
permit
for
every
ton
of
they
emit
eu
carbon
prices
have
more
than
doubled
this
year
to
around
euros
a
ton
meaning
the
total
carbon
price
for
british
companies
is
around
pounds
a
ton
in
last
year
s
budget
when
eu
carbon
prices
were
lower
the
government
said
the
total
carbon
price
at
that
time
around
pounds
per
ton
was
the
right
level
leading
to
concerns
among
companies
and
green
groups
the
domestic
tax
could
be
lowered
at
the
next
budget
the
high
carbon
price
has
helped
to
make
coal
generation
less
economic
and
encouraged
companies
to
switch
to
gas
generation
reducing
britain
s
greenhouse
gas
emissions
given
recent
gas
price
rises
a
higher
total
carbon
price
is
now
required
to
maintain
this
status
quo
said
a
separate
letter
to
the
ministry
from
green
groups
including
greenpeace
friends
of
the
earth
and
wwf
earlier
in
october
britain
s
national
grid
said
power
generation
was
likely
to
rise
over
the
winter
as
high
gas
prices
made
coal
power
plants
more
profitable
setting
a
price
on
carbon
dioxide
emissions
is
aimed
at
curbing
pollution
and
helping
britain
meet
its
target
to
cut
emissions
by
percent
on
levels
by
britain
is
already
toward
meeting
this
target
with
much
of
the
emissions
reductions
achieved
attributed
to
a
sharp
fall
in
coal
power
generation
