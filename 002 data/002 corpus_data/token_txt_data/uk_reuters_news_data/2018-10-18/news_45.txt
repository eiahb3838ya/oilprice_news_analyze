mexico
s
incoming
government
will
soon
inherit
a
costly
dilemma
over
an
ethane
supply
contract
between
national
oil
company
pemex
and
a
consortium
led
by
a
unit
of
brazilian
builder
odebrecht
under
the
contract
s
terms
pemex
has
had
to
supply
ethane
well
below
current
market
prices
a
hydrocarbon
that
comes
from
natural
gas
ethane
is
used
to
make
ethylene
which
in
turn
is
used
to
make
the
common
plastic
polyethylene
at
the
plant
near
the
gulf
coast
port
of
coatzacoalcos
the
plant
is
operated
by
the
consortium
in
which
odebrecht
s
unit
braskem
has
a
percent
stake
and
mexico
s
grupo
idesa
holds
the
remainder
energy
aides
to
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
who
takes
office
have
said
the
contract
is
problematic
but
have
not
yet
said
what
the
new
government
will
do
about
it
the
contract
with
braskem
is
very
damaging
to
mexico
s
interests
armando
guadiana
of
lopez
obrador
s
morena
party
and
the
head
of
the
senate
energy
commission
told
reuters
last
week
pemex
is
fully
owned
by
the
government
the
consortium
told
reuters
last
week
it
has
no
plans
to
void
the
contract
if
lopez
obrador
were
to
direct
pemex
to
cancel
the
contract
it
would
be
forced
to
purchase
from
the
consortium
the
sprawling
etileno
xxi
petrochemical
facility
currently
valued
at
billion
according
to
a
contract
annex
seen
by
reuters
in
a
written
response
disputed
that
valuation
saying
it
did
not
reflect
the
conditions
of
the
agreement
the
company
declined
to
give
an
alternative
purchase
value
saying
the
contract
was
confidential
pemex
did
not
respond
to
questions
about
the
valuation
conversely
if
the
new
government
opted
to
stick
to
the
deal
it
could
only
hope
for
more
favorable
ethane
prices
that
might
reduce
its
losses
under
the
terms
of
the
contract
pemex
committed
to
selling
ethane
to
based
on
a
formula
that
worked
out
to
around
cents
per
gallon
at
the
start
of
the
deal
in
at
the
time
market
prices
for
ethane
were
three
times
that
at
cents
per
gallon
current
ethane
prices
hover
around
cents
per
gallon
a
pemex
spokesman
said
the
contract
which
took
effect
in
responded
to
the
market
conditions
of
that
said
the
formula
was
also
used
for
other
ethane
consumers
before
the
facility
began
operations
in
pemex
produced
more
ethane
than
it
needed
forcing
it
to
inject
excess
supply
back
into
its
natural
gas
pipelines
pemex
s
production
of
ethane
this
year
averages
barrels
per
day
bpd
but
this
is
now
insufficient
to
supply
its
own
morelos
and
cangrejera
petrochemical
facilities
that
require
a
combined
bpd
plus
the
contract
obligation
of
bpd
as
a
result
pemex
was
forced
to
turn
to
ethane
imports
this
year
for
the
first
time
as
domestic
oil
and
gas
production
continues
to
fall
costing
pemex
some
million
during
the
first
half
of
according
to
reuters
calculations
due
to
the
cost
of
imported
ethane
at
market
rates
compared
to
the
cheaper
formula
in
the
contract
with
the
consortium
if
pemex
is
left
without
enough
ethane
it
would
have
to
shut
down
the
cracking
plants
at
its
two
petrochemical
facilities
and
the
cost
of
them
after
being
idled
one
week
would
be
some
million
according
to
comments
from
the
head
of
pemex
s
ethylene
unit
alejandro
cruz
at
a
board
meeting
in
december
in
june
pricing
agency
platts
reported
that
pemex
entered
into
a
million
contract
with
swiss
commodities
trader
vitol
to
supply
tonnes
of
ethane
to
pemex
through
both
pemex
and
vitol
declined
to
confirm
the
deal
in
mexico
s
federal
auditor
determined
that
pemex
ethane
exports
during
a
stretch
of
that
year
could
have
yielded
the
company
more
than
million
had
it
not
been
for
the
contract
using
official
data
reuters
calculated
a
similar
million
opportunity
cost
in
pemex
declined
to
comment
on
the
calculations
said
it
was
incorrect
to
speculate
on
opportunity
cost
or
link
such
costs
exclusively
to
the
contract
citing
wider
problems
at
pemex
the
consortium
said
the
contract
was
mutually
beneficial
arguing
that
it
helps
cut
mexico
s
reliance
on
foreign
plastics
we
are
not
planning
on
undoing
a
positive
contractual
relationship
that
we
ve
been
building
with
pemex
and
that
brings
benefits
to
all

pick

mexico
s
new
energy
minister
has
said
the
incoming
government
will
review
the
contract
for
possible
signs
of
corruption
part
of
a
broader
energy
contract
review
the
consortium
s
plata
said
he
was
confident
the
contract
will
not
be
modified
said
the
contract
was
the
result
of
an
auction
process
led
by
pemex
and
that
it
is
false
to
allege
corruption
in
the
awarding
of
the
contract
the
consortium
s
plata
said
he
was
confident
the
contract
will
not

according
to
a
transcript
of
a
recent
session
of
the
board
of
directors
of
pemex
s
ethane
unit
acting
director
rodulfo

admitted
that
supplying

the
most
serious
problem

minister

the
contract
was
reviewed
by
the
separate
board
of
the
joint
venture
luis
miguel
labardini
a
mexico
energy
consultant
said
an
even
bigger
problem
for
pemex
lies
with
whoever
agreed
to
the
contract
s
terms
in
the
first
place
we
should
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
whoever
negotiated
this
contract
that
they
didn

act
in
bad
faith
