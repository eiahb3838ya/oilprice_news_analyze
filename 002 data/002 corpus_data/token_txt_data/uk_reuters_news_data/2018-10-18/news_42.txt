mills in china's top steel city boost output despite winter ban start
reuters
steelmakers
in
tangshan
china
s
biggest
steel
producing
city
are
boosting
output
as
local
officials
have
failed
to
issue
precise
orders
on
output
curbs
even
though
the
city
s
winter
pollution
restrictions
took
effect
two
weeks
ago
the
rising
output
means
factories
and
steel
plants
are
emitting
more
pollutants
and
tangshan
s
lack
of
guidance
shows
that
the
chinese
central
government
s
more
nuanced
approach
to
pollution
curbs
may
not
be
working
as
intended
on
china
s
ministry
of
environment
and
ecology
issued
new
winter
plans
that
allowed
provinces
and
cities
to
set
their
own
industrial
output
curbs
as
a
way
to
limit
pollution
moving
away
from
blanket
cuts
ordered
last
year
tangshan
finalised
its
own
winter
plan
on
that
would
put
companies
into
four
categories
based
on
their
emissions
output
with
the
companies
having
to
cut
their
output
by
between
percent
and
percent
based
on
the
category
they
fall
under
the
plan
will
run
from
to
march
however
tangshan
has
not
issued
a
list
of
the
sorted
companies
according
to
multiple
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
meaning
no
one
knows
their
expected
output
curbs
without
the
guidance
at
least
two
steel
producers
in
tangshan
said
they
have
been
operating
normally
since
the
start
of
the
month
everyone
is
still
waiting
for
instructions
but
no
word
has
come
out
yet
said
one
of
the
sources
a
manager
at
hebei
donghai
special
steel
co
a
privately
owned
mill
with
annual
capacity
of
million
tonnes
apart
from
recent
emergency
measures
and
scheduled
maintenance
we
did
not
slow
operations
after
the
extended
summer
cuts
expired
in
september
said
a
manager
for
raw
materials
at
guofeng
iron
and
steel
co
which
has
annual
capacity
of
million
tonnes
a
person
at
the
tangshan
city
government
public
relations
department
said
that
they
would
ask
the
relevant
department
about
the
issue
when
contacted
on
wednesday
by
reuters
for
a
comment
the
utilization
rate
at
blast
furnaces
in
tangshan
climbed
percentage
points
from
late
september
to
percent
on
the
highest
since
late
july
according
to
data
compiled
by
mysteel
consultancy
as
tangshan
mills
ramp
up
steel
output
to
chase
strong
prices
other
producers
could
follow
and
supply
from
hebei
province
where
tangshan
is
located
could
rise
as
it
enforces
more
lenient
cuts
said
richard
lu
an
analyst
at
cru
consultancy
steel
supply
from
hebei
might
be
higher
than
last
year
but
it
is
still
uncertain
if
total
supply
across
china
will
go
up
as
well
since
more
regions
would
be
included
into
the
winter
pollution
campaign
this
year
said
lu
average
profit
margins
at
steel
mills
across
china
are
over
yuan
a
ton
according
to
huatai
futures
china
last
winter
ordered
mills
in
northern
cities
to
cut
output
by
up
to
half
causing
steel
prices
to
rise
percent
in
this
year
prices
are
up
percent
for
the
curbs
will
still
cover
the
cities
though
there
are
also
draft
rules
to
include
another
eight
cities
in
the
yangtze
river
delta
and
cities
in
northwestern
china
in
tangshan
the
district
of
guye
ordered
a
cut
of
percent
of
industrial
capacity
at
its
steel
mills
from
to
the
district
said
in
a
statement
last
week
the
district
will
adjust
the
reduction
rate
after
city
authorities
give
detailed
instructions
the
statement
said
tangshan
was
ranked
as
china
s
smoggiest
city
in
september
among
tracked
by
the
ministry
of
ecology
and
