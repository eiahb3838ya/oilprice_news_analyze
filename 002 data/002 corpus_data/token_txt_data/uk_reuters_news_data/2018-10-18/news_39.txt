woodside
chief
financial
officer
sherry
duhe
said
on
thursday
it
is
something
that
technically
we
re
quite
confident
about
at
this
point
and
the
progress
that
we
re
making
in

off

looking

s
really
about
us
having
the

report
browse
the
biggest
undeveloped
gas
resource
off
northwestern
australia
has
been
stuck
on
the
drawing
board
for
years
as
plans
for
onshore
and
floating
lng
developments
estimated
at
up
to
billion
were
scrapped
the
development
cost
has
been
slashed
as
browse
will
now
feed
the
existing
north
west
shelf
lng
plant
rather
than
requiring
a
new
plant
to
be
built
and
contractors
have
indicated
there
might
be
opportunities
to
trim
the
estimated
billion
cost
