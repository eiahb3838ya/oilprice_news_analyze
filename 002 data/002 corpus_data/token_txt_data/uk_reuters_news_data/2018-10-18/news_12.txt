owain
johnson
managing
director
for
energy
research

at

said
the

has
also
led

to
introduce
the
first
change
to
the

since
coming
into
force
from

johnson
said
he
sees
a
trend
in
which
the
biggest
benchmarks
are
going
global
while
smaller
ones
are
withering
away
shale
and
heavy
canadian
crudes
have
had
a
major
impact
on
the
quality
of
crude
for
export
after
refiners
complained
about
blended
grades
dubbed
the
cme
announced
last
year
that
five
new
tests
would
be
conducted
to
ensure
quality
consistency
the
tests
are
being
introduced
gradually
and
the
industry
must
comply
with
them
fully
by
january
next
year
we
wanted
to
ensure
that
the
barrel
at
cushing
is
a
clean
barrel
that
does
not
have
too
much
blended
canadian
material
in
it
he
said
referring
to
the
traditional
hub
for
wti
in
cushing
oklahoma
the
changes
have
already
largely
been
adopted
and
priced
in
ahead
of
the
official
shift
in
january
he
said
the
cme
has
been
launching
new
oil
contracts
for
new
crude
grades
as
spreads
to
wti
that
have
been
picked
up
quickly
by
the
market
johnson
said
they
are
some
of
the
launches
new
derivatives
are
very
liquid
for
new
grades
it
s
trading
very
aggressively
mainly
through
brokers
and
they
re
popular
with
asian
and
european
importers
he
said
furthermore
as
the
significance
of
landlocked
cushing
wanes
as
a
hub
the
global
exchanges
are
racing
to
introduce
new
contracts
out
of
houston
on
the
cme

launch
a
