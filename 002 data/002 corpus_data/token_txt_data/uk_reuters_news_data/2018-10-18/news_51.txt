a
week
after
hurricane
michael
battered
florida
s
gulf
coast
with
record
fury
the
full
extent
of
devastation
and
loss
of
life
remained
unclear
on
wednesday
as
disruptions
to
phone
power
and
transportation
systems
hindered
the
disaster
recovery
at
least
people
were
killed
according
to
local
authorities
when
michael
plowed
ashore
as
one
of
the
fiercest
hurricanes
on
record
to
strike
the
mainland
pulverizing
a
cluster
of
seaside
towns
along
florida
s
northwestern
panhandle
region
seven
days
later
search
crews
continued
combing
through
the
wreckage
of
demolished
neighbourhoods
looking
for
any
sign
of
additional
victims
in
panama
city
beach
mexico
beach
and
port
joe
the
communities
closest
to
the
storm
s
landfall
distribution
of
food
and
water
to
residents
farther
inland
has
been
slowed
by
communication
outages
and
roads
blocked
by
toppled
trees
power
lines
and
other
debris
florida
officials
have
not
said
how
many
people
may
be
missing
teams
of
volunteers
with
the
crowdsource
rescue
organization
were
trying
to
reach
more
than
florida
residents
reported
unaccounted
for
by
worried
relatives
and
friends
said
matthew
marchetti
the
organization
s
most
of
that
number
down
from
people
the
group
was
trying
to
locate
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
the
storm
are
from
panama
city
and
many
of
them
are
elderly
disabled
impoverished
or
living
alone
marchetti
said
he
said
the
search
had
been
hampered
by
spotty
cell
phone
service
in
the
devastated
area
though
authorities
were
making
progress
in
restoring
communications
high
volumes
of
missing
persons
reports
are
not
uncommon
in
the
days
following
a
natural
disaster
because
so
many
survivors
fail
to
check
in
with
loved
ones
right
away
or
lack
the
means
to
do
so
because
of
phone
and
power
outages
authorities
said
nevertheless
at
least
florida
residents
in
the
counties
hardest
hit
by
hurricane
michael
had
registered
for
disaster
assistance
as
of
wednesday
with
the
federal
emergency
management
agency

represents
about

of
the
counties
designated
by
president
donald
trump
s
federal
disaster
declaration
as
eligible
for
fema
aid
to
individuals
and
households
nearly
a
third
or
more
than
people
reported
storm
damage
to
their
homes
when
they
signed
up
with
fema
though
the
full
scope
of
property
losses
remained
to
be
seen

of
wednesday

homeless
by
the
storm
in

six
more

virginia
three
in
north
carolina
and
one
in

determining
whether
