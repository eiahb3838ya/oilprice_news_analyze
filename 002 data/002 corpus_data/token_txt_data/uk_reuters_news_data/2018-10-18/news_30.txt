nigeria
s
state
oil
firm
nnpc
has
extended
its
swap
contracts
the
country
s
main
avenue
to
meet
the
bulk
of
its
fuel
needs
until
june
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
despite
having
a
refining
capacity
of
about
barrels
per
day
its
plants
have
been
underperforming
for
years
making
africa
s
biggest
oil
producer
almost
wholly
dependent
on
imports
to
meet
its
domestic
gasoline
and
diesel
needs
nigeria
s
gasoline
consumption
is
roughly
million
litres
per
day
in
the
nation
of
almost
million
people
the
west
african
country
became
increasingly
reliant
on
nnpc
for
fuel
imports
via
swaps
after
a
currency
devaluation
and
recession
in
the
last
few
years
which
priced
independent
importers
out
of
the
spot
market
a
spokesman
for
nnpc
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
nnpc
s
swap
contracts
currently
account
for
about
percent
of
the
country
s
imports
while
percent
is
done
through
the
spot
market
one
of
the
sources
added
the
swap
contracts
known
as
direct
sale
direct
purchase
came
into
effect
in
july
last
year
and
were
due
to
end
after
one
year
they
were
already
extended
once
earlier
this
year
to
december
nnpc
paired
up
foreign
trading
firms
with
local
partners
to
do
the
swaps
nnpc
is
separately
in
advanced
discussions
with
some
of
the
swap
contract
holders
to
invest
in
rehabilitating
its
refineries
two
consortiums
were
picked
earlier
this
year
but
ironing
out
the
financing
of
the
projects
has
been
slow
