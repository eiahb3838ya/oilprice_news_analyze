in

the

s
largest
publicly

oil

company
is
turning
toward
beijing
for
business
at
a
time
when
most
of

looking
elsewhere
to
avoid
the
threat

exxon

placing
big

lng
demand
coupling

production
projects
around

with
its

its

strategy
is
moving
on
two
tracks
expanding
output
of
the
gas
in
places
such
as
papua
new
guinea
and
mozambique
and
creating
demand
for
those
supplies
in
china
by
opening
exxon
s
first
import
and
storage
hub
according
to
an
exxon
manager
and
people
briefed
on
the
company
s
plans
that
combination
will
guarantee
us
a
steady
outlet
for
lots
of

said

was
not

the

on

one
of
the
company

this
year
the

china
s
natural
gas
demand
is
rising
really
fast
with
imports
soaring
well
over
percent
annually
at
the
moment
because
of
the
government
gasification
program
and
due
to
fast
rising
industrial
demand
including
in
petrochemicals
the
exxon
manager
said

an

to
provide
an

the

the

provides
a
sign
that
china
is
willing
to
let
foreign
interests
invest
in
things
that
in
the
past
were
seen
as
exxon
is
among
the
top
ranked
companies
that
are
pushing
ahead
in
china
despite
the
trade
dispute
but
it
is
not

european

the
decision
to
expand
its
lng
production
and
open
an
import
terminal
in
the
world
s

is
a
step
by

pull
the

exxon

also
are
adapting
to
changing
buyer
behavior
in
the
past
lng
was
dominated
by
supply
contracts
especially
with
japanese
and
south
korean
buyers
that
could
span
several
decades
and
in
which
buyer
and
seller
agree
to
a
fixed
monthly
volume
at
a
set
price
formula
usually
priced
off
crude
oil
that
is
changing
in
part
because
china
s
importers
either
demand
more
contract
flexibility
or
simply
buy
lng
at
in
the
spot
market
whenever
they
need
it
the
shift
away
from
such
rigid
deals
is
forcing
producers
to
trade
new
lng
supplies
and
give
import
terminals
a
larger
role
in
encouraging
spot
purchases
lng
players
are
increasingly
adopting
an
lng
portfolio
model
whereby
supply
projects
are
not
directly
linked
to
end
customers
with
over
percent
of
contracts
now
coming
from
portfolio
suppliers
rather
than
specific
