retiring u.s. coal, nuclear plants pose reliability challenges -nerc

changes
in
the
north
american
generation
mix
from
coal
and
nuclear
to
natural
gas
and
renewables
could
threaten
power
system
reliability
in
some
areas
over
the
next
decade
the
organization
responsible
for
the
region
s
grid
said
on
thursday
but
the
electric
industry
has
time
to
address
reliability
concerns
before
they
become
actual
problems
that
affect
consumers

corp
nerc
said
in
a
assessment
with
proper
planning
and
considerations
that
address
the
changing
characteristics
of
our
generation
supply
industry
will
successfully
navigate
the
unique
set
of
reliability
challenges
that
flow
from
an
evolving
resource
mix
john
moura
director
of
reliability
assessment
at
nerc
said
in
a
release
this
is
the
second
report
by
nerc
this
week
that
could
help
the
trump
administration
justify
its
plan
to
subsidize
continued
operation
of
coal
and
nuclear
plants
which
are
being
hurt
by
low
gas
prices
and
growing
use
of
renewables
president
donald
trump
has
been
advocating
for
steps
to
stem
a
surge
in
coal
and
nuclear
retirements
in
recent
years
arguing
that
more
shutdowns
would
leave
the
country
less
able
to
bounce
back
from
disruptions
caused
by
storms
physical
attacks
and
hackers
for
a
factbox
on
coal
and
nuclear
retirements
see
earlier
this
week
nerc
said
new
pipelines
and
power
lines
would
be
required
to
meet
electric
demands
if
there
are
retirements
of
coal
and
nuclear
plants
in
its
latest
assessment
nerc
said
texas
the
midwest
and
ontario
need
more
generation
resources
to
avoid
the
risk
of
below
target
reserve
margins
over
the
next
five
years
the
reserve
margin
is
the
difference
between
total
generation
available
and
forecasted
peak
demand
as
reliance
on
generation
increases
in
some
areas
like
new
york
and
new
england
market
operators
and
policymakers
are
already
developing
fuel
assurance
mechanisms
to
mitigate
supply
disruptions
caused
by
limited
gas
pipeline
capacity
and
other
factors
nerc
said
a
total
of
megawatts
of
new
generation
is
planned
through
nerc
said
one
megawatt
is
enough
to
power
about
homes
in
florida
texas
and
california
plants
are
projected
to
account
for
more
than
percent
of
generation
used
during
the
day
for
states
like
california
with
lots
of
solar
power
nerc
recommended
grid
operators
have
enough
flexible
resources
like
turbines
that
can
ramp
up
quickly
in
case
the
sun
stops
shining
over
a
large
area
