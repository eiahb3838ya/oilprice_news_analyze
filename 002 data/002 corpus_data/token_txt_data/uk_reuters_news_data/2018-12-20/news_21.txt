stuttering
the
fed
s
move
on
wednesday
to
largely
adhere
to
its
plan
for
additional
rate
hikes
over
the
next
two
years
raised
worries
for
market
participants
from
asia
to
europe
as

their
lowest
in
two
years

day
of

it
appears
that
risky
asset
markets
wanted
a
stronger
put
from
the
fed
given
the
ongoing
recession
obsession
taking
over
the

it
said
some
further
gradual

would
be
needed
in
the

projecting
two
rises
on

next
year
instead
of
the
three
predicted
in

although
largely
in

with
expectations
that

little
to
soothe

over
slowing
world
growth
trade
tensions
with
china
and
tightening
monetary
conditions
