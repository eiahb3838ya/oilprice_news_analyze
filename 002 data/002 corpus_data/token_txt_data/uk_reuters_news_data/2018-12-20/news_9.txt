next
two
years
spread
from

to

next

instead
of
the

predicted
in

although
largely
in

with

that

failed
to
soothe
a
cocktail
of
market
fears
over

growth
trade
tensions
with

from

joining
bourses
in
shanghai
and
hong
kong
it
appears
that
risky
asset
markets
wanted
a
stronger
put
from
the

the
ongoing
recession
obsession
taking
over

said

global

the
angst

saw

flock
towards
the

german
government
bond
yields
the

benchmark
fell
to
their
lowest
in
nearly
seven
months
other
high

bond
yields
also
fell
bund
yields
followed
those
of
treasuries
which
sank
to
more
than
lows
the
treasuries
yield
had
earlier
fallen
as
low
as
percent
a
level
last
seen
in
early
april
oil
prices
meanwhile
slumped
by
more
than
percent
as
worries
about
oversupply
and
worldwide
demand
for
energy
pushed
prices
back
towards
their
lowest
levels
in
over
a
year
growth
concerns
continue
to
percolate
in
the
background
and
you
can
see
that
with

coming
off
that

a
macro
story
said
alvin
tan
an
foreign

strategist
at
societe
generale
you
can
see
this
in
the
yield
curve
flattening
even
further
after
the
the
rise
in
interest
rates
and
a
fall
in
yields
of
bonds
rekindled
worries
of
an
inversion
between
bonds
and
yields
historically
a
fairly
reliable
indicator
that
a
recession
is
brewing
the
yield
stood
at
percent
just
percent
less
than
the
yield
the
equity
losses
added
to
the
worst
year
for
world
stocks
since
the
global
financial
crisis
with

world

index
down
percent
nearly
trillion

been
wiped
off
world
stocks
this
year
with
emerging
markets
trampled
flat
by
a
charging
dollar
still
the
dollar
fell
against
major
currencies
after
the
fed
s
decision
to
a
low
losing
ground
because
of
perceptions
of
a
more
hawkish
position
than
anticipated
the
greenback
fell
percent
against
its
rivals
to
on
a
daily
basis
it
is
set
for
the
biggest
percentage
drop
in
six
weeks
the
euro
gained
percent
to
boosted
by
news
that
italy
had
struck
a
deal
with
the
european
commission
over
its
contested
budget
and
some
solid

data
this
week

banks
japan
kept
its

settings
unchanged
as
expected
britain
also
kept
