world

slumped
on
thursday
after
the

dashed
investor
hopes
of
a
more
dovish
policy
outlook
even
as
signs
grow
that
global
economic

is
stuttering
jitters
over
the

move
to
largely
keep
guidance
for
additional
hikes
over
the
next
two
years
spread
from
asia
to
europe
where
major

fell
to
their

in

shedding

it

rates
by

point
as

to
a

it
said
some
further
rate
hikes
would
be
necessary
in
the
year
ahead
with

projecting
two
rises
on
average
next
year
instead
of
the
three
predicted
in
september
a
change
largely
in
line
with
expectations
but
that
minor
revision
could
not
soothe
market
fears
over
a
further
economic
slowdown
on
the
back
of
trade
tensions
with
china
a
waning
boost
from
tax
cuts
and
tightening
monetary
conditions
for
companies
it
appears
that
risky
asset
markets
wanted
a
stronger
put
from
the
fed
given
the
ongoing
recession
obsession
taking
over
the
market

oil
prices
fell
more
than

erasing
most
of
their
gains
from
the
day
before
and
heading
back
towards
their
lowest
levels
for
more
than
a
year
amid
worries
about
oversupply
and
the

the
biggest
decline
since
march
a
rise
in

and
a
fall
in
the

rekindled
worries
of
an
inversion
in
the

curve
where

historically
an

between

been
seen
as
a

reliable
indicator

just
percent
less

of

the
impact
of
the

decision
especially
for
foreign
countries
depends
on
how
much
the
dollar
will
go
up
former
