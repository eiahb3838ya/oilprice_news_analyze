stocks
are

for

december
decline
since
the
depths
of
the
great
depression
i
think
the
fed
may
be
underestimating
other
factors
at
play
said
bob
baur
chief
global
economist
at
principal
global
investors
in
des
moines
iowa
in
the
unites
states
trade
has
been
making
headlines
but
i
think
a
gradual
tightening
of
monetary
policy
has
been
the
driving
force
behind
recent
market
volatility
with
corporate
borrowing
and
spending
still
high
and
the
fed
continuing
to
reduce
its
balance
sheet
i
d
expect
volatility
to
remain
if
this
tightening
continues
he
said
the
fed
raised
key
overnight
lending
rate
rates
by
percent
point
as
expected
to
a
range
of
percent
to
percent
it
said
some
further
rate
hikes
would
be
necessary
in
the
year
ahead
with
its
policymakers
projecting
two
rate
hikes
on
average
next
year
instead
of
three
they
saw
back
in
september
a
change
that
was
also
largely
in
line
with
expectations
but
the
slight
revision
was
not
enough
to
ease
market
fears
over
a
further
economic
slowdown
on
the
back
of
trade
tensions
a
waning
boost
from
tax
cuts
and
tightening
monetary
conditions
for
companies
junk
bonds
sold
off
sharply
with
their
etfs
falling
percent
the
biggest
decline
since
march
as
investors
flocked
to
the
safety
of
government
bonds
the
treasuries
yield
fell
to
as
low
as
percent
a
level
last
seen
in
early
april
a
rise
in
interest
rates
and
a
fall
in
the
yield
rekindled
worries
of
an
inversion
in
the
yield
curve
where
yields
become
higher
than
ones
historically
an
inversion
between
such
as
and
yields
and
yields
has
been
seen
as
a
fairly
reliable
indicator
of
a
recession
down
the
road
we
expect
additional
rate
hikes
will
invert
the
to
yield
curve
which
is
a
reliable
signal
for
a
bear
market
for
stocks
and
a
coming
recession
for
both
the
and
the
rest
of
the
world
said
jeffrey
kleintop
chief
investment
strategist
at
charles
schwab
in
boston
so
seriously
something
to
keep
a
close
eye
on
we
do
expect
a
very
difficult
year
for
the
yield
stood
at
percent
just
percentage
point
less
than
the
yield
as
one
basis
point
rate
hike
would
likely
invert
the
yield
curve
many
market
players
are
sceptical
whether
the
fed
can
raise
rates
at
all
next
year
fed
funds
futures
are
now
pricing
in
only
about
a
percent
chance
of
one
rate
hike
the
dollar
initially
gained
as
the
fed
was
seen
as
more
hawkish
but
it
lost
steam
against
other
currencies
such
as
the
yen
the
greenback
slipped
percent
to
its
low
of
while
the
euro
also
gained
a
tad
to
the
chinese
yuan
weakened
after
china
s
central
bank
introduced
a
targeted
lending
measure
on
thursday
to
support
growth
in
a
slowing
economy
the
onshore
yuan
was
trading
at
per
dollar
percent
weaker
on
the
day
having
earlier
weakened
to
per
dollar
on
thursday
japan
kept
its
policy
settings
unchanged
as
expected
later
in
the
day
uk
and
sweden
will
make
policy
announcements
both
are
expected
to
keep
their
policies
on
hold
though
the
swedish
central
bank
s
decision
is
seen
as
a
close
call
with
some
analysts
expecting
a
rate
hike
oil
prices
fell
on
thursday
to
erase
most
of
their
gains
from
the
day
before
resuming
declines
seen
earlier
in
the
week
amid
worries
about
oversupply
and
the
outlook
for
the
global
economy
the
crude
contract
dropped
percent
to
per
barrel
while
international
benchmark
brent
crude
futures
were
down
percent
at
per
barrel
