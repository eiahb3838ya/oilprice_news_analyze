opened
a
criminal
investigation
into
energy

lp
s
construction
of
the
mariner
east
natural
gas
liquids
pipelines
in
pennsylvania
we
have
seen
sinkholes
created
by
the

drilling
contaminated
well
water
and
some
subtle
and
bullying
of
chester
county
citizens
by
big
corporate
interests
hogan
said
in
a
release
on
wednesday
this
is
the
latest
in
a
long
series
of
legal
and
regulatory
actions
against
energy
transfer
over
construction
of
the
mariner
east
pipeline
we
vehemently
deny
any
such
wrongdoing
and
we
take
issue
with
the
many
factual
inaccuracies
contained
in
the
district
attorney
s
press
release
energy
transfer
said
in
a
statement
on
thursday
saying
the
company
looked
forward
to
opening
a
dialogue
with
the
district
attorney
s
office
mariner
east
transports
liquids
from
the
marcellus
and
utica
shale
fields
in
western
pennsylvania
to
customers
in
the
state
and
elsewhere
including
international
exports
from
energy
transfer
s
marcus
hook
complex
near
philadelphia
energy
transfer
started
work
on
a
billion
expansion
of
the
project
in
february
and
had
planned
to
finish
the
new
pipeline
in
the
third
quarter
of
but
completion
has
been
delayed
by
several
work
stoppages
by
state
agencies
due
to
permit
violations
and
other
problems
including
release
of
drilling
fluids
into
waterways
and
discovery
of
sinkholes
energy
transfer
has
said
it
expects
to
put
mariner
east
into
service
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
pipe
crosses
chester
county
in
the
southeast
part
of
the
state
in
addition
to
accusing
the
company
of
criminal
wrongdoing
hogan
said
the
governor
and
state
agencies
have
not
done
enough
to
police
energy
transfer
s
construction
of
mariner
east
we
expected
the
state
regulators
and
the
governor
to
step
in
and
assure
the
safety
of
pennsylvanians
they
have
not
hogan
said
so
now
the
chester
county
district
attorney
s
office
will
demand
that
every
aspect
of
these
pipelines
be
conducted
in
response
the
pennsylvania
department
of
environmental
protection
dep
said
it
has
issued
more
than
notices
for
permit
violations
and
collected
more
than
million
in
penalties
the
commonwealth
is
living
up
to
our
promise
to
hold
this
project
accountable
the
dep
said
hogan
said
potential
charges
included
causing
or
risking
a
catastrophe
criminal
mischief
and
environmental
crimes
which
could
result
in
criminal
charges
against
workers
on
the
pipeline
and
corporate
officers
