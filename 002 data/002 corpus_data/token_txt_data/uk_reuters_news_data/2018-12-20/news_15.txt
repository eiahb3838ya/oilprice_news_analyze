crushing
in
brazil
s
main
sugarcane
producing
region
for
the
season
should
roughly
match
this
year
s
production
as
planted
area
shrinks
but
yields
improve
analysts
said
on
thursday
for
the
current
season
which
ends
in
december
mills
in
the
region
are
expected
to
crush
roughly
million
tonnes
of
sugarcane
according
to
antonio
de
padua
rodrigues
the
director
of
industry
group
unica
that
represents
a
decline
of
roughly
percent
from
the
season
but
unica
predicts
that
crushing
will
stabilize
in
matching
the
current
season
s
level
rodrigues
declined
to
give
an
exact
prediction
for
sugarcane
processing
next
year
cautioning
it
is
still
early
to
make
a
precise
forecast
by
the
amount
of
sugarcane
processed
in
the
of
brazil
had
stood
at
million
tonnes
according
to
the
industry
group
the
season
will
continue
to
be
very
alcoholic
with
millers
continuing
to
direct
a
majority
of
the
cane
to
producing
ethanol
due
to
the
fuel
s
relative
price
advantage
over
sugar
rodrigues
said
some
percent
of
the
cane
was
directed
to
ethanol
production
in
unica
data
showed
yields
next
season
could
increase
tonne
per
hectare
as
the
average
age
of
cane
fields
will
fall
from
years
to
years
said
luiz
antonio
dias
paes
market
and
business
director
at
sugarcane
group
centro
de
tecnologia
canavieira
sa
ctc
that
would
offset
an
expected
decrease
in
planted
area
of
around
percent
as
some
farmers
switch
to
grains
paes
said
so
far
all
is
going
well
if
we
have
a
normal
summer
the
expectation
is
that
sugarcane
yields
will
grow
