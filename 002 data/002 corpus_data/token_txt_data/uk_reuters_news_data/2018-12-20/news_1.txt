uganda
s
energy
minister
said
on
thursday
she
had
given
tullow
oil
conditional
approval
to
sell
part
of
its
stake
in
ugandan
oilfields
to
france
s
total
and
china
s
cnooc
but
only
after
million
of
tax
on
the
deal
is
paid
tullow
agreed
early
last
year
to
sell
total
most
of
its
stake
in
ugandan
fields
for
million
but
cnooc
later
exercised
its
rights
to
buy
half
of
the
tullow
assets
on
sale
i
gave
conditional
consent
for
this
transaction
subject
to
payment
of
tax
obligations
as
assessed
by
the
uganda
revenue
authority
of
about
million
energy
minister
irene
muloni
told
a
news
conference
the
three
firms
currently
each
hold
a
percent
stake
in
the
fields
and
tullow
is
now
selling
percent
of
its
stake
which
will
be
split
equally
between
total
and
cnooc
tullow
spokesman
george
cazenove
said
in
an
emailed
statement
tullow
believed
it
should
not
have
to
pay
the
assessed
ugandan
tax
as
tullow
has
stated
on
a
number
of
occasions
we
believe
that
this
deal
should
not
attract
substantial
tax
liabilities
and
that
this
position
is
supported
by
uganda
s
tax
laws
he
said
tullow
and
its
partners
remain
in
discussions
with
the
government
of
uganda
on
this
matter
and
the
deal
will
only
complete
when
those
negotiations
are
brought
to
a
satisfactory
muloni
said
after
the
deal
is
finalised
tullow
would
be
a
and
total
would
be
the
operator
in
the
northern
part
of
license
area
while
cnooc
uganda
would
be
the
operator
of
the
southern
part
of
the
area
given
the
above
progress
we
now
expect
the
licensed
companies
to
undertake
the
final
investment
decision
for
the
upstream
projects
before
june
she
said
uganda
discovered
commercial
crude
oil
deposits
in
the
west
of
the
country
near
the
border
with
the
democratic
republic
of
congo
more
than
years
ago
the
start
of
commercial
production
has
been
repeatedly
delayed
due
to
a
lack
of
required
infrastructure
such
as
a
refinery
and
an
export
pipeline
the
government
said
last
month
that
it
now
expects
oil
production
to
start
in
a
year
later
than
previously
expected
muloni
said
the
government
also
planned
to
do
another
licensing
round
for
vacant
blocks
in
but
the
number
of
blocks
that
would
be
auctioned
has
yet
to
be
determined
muloni
said
uganda
s
gross
crude
reserves
had
also
been
revised
downwards
after
new
reservoir
analyses
to
billion
barrels
from
billion
previously
recoverable
reserves
remained
at
billion
barrels
ugandan
fields
also
held
billion
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas
she
said
the
oil
firms
are
expected
to
spend
between
billion
and
billion
to
develop
ugandan
fields
and
the
associated
infrastructure
and
the
east
african
country
is
banking
on
that
investment
and
potential
proceeds
from
crude
exports
of
about
barrels
per
day
to
drive
growth
