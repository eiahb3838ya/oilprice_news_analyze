about
what
actions
they
are
taking
to
address
the

lodged
by

worked

at

head
of
the

in
the
united
states
and
antonio
maarraoui
the

s
head
for

and
the

had
full

neither

was
charged
on
thursday
neither
of
the
executives
has
replied
to
repeated
requests
for
comment
brazil
s
unprecedented
sprawling
graft
investigations
have
been
built
on
testimony
prosecutors
told
reuters
they
will
aggressively
use
the
same
tactics
in
this
case
charge
smaller
figures
involved
and
work
to
reach
plea
deals
with
them
seeking
testimony
against
the
executives
at
the
foreign
firms
they
allege
are
involved
the
stakes
are
high
for
the
trading
firms
brazilian
prosecutors
allege
some
of
the
crimes
were
carried
out
by
petrobras
traders
based
in
houston
and
that
some
illicit
funds
moved
through
the
and
european
banking
systems
raising
the
chance
that
jurisdiction
for
investigating
the
case
would
widen
brazilian
and
prosecutors
have
worked
closely
in
the
past
on
car
wash
cases
loans
to
the
companies
could
dry
up
if
the
corruption
allegations
stick
according
to
a
senior
banking
executive
at
a
major
global
bank
who
declined
to
be
identified
since
the
financial
crisis
big
banks
have
faced
increased
scrutiny
from
regulators
to
crack
down
on
money
laundering
and
other
financial
crimes
the
probe
has
already
frozen
their
current
business
in
brazil
an
increasingly
important
global
oil
producer
but
not
yet
a
major
source
of
revenue
for
the
firms
trafigura
said
its
turnover
in
brazil
last
year
was
million
a
fraction
of
its
overall
billion
in
glencore
and
vitol
would
not
provide
revenue
details
but
said
brazil
was
a
minor
market
vitol
has
a
deal
pending
to
purchase
a
stake
in
petrobras
prized
nigerian
oilfields
in
its
statement
to
reuters
petrobras
said
there
were
no
indications
of
wrongdoing
in
that
deal
but
it
would
be
up
to
brazilian
regulators
to
make
the
final
determination
the
new
developments
are
also
a
signal
that
brazil
s
landmark
car
wash
probe
is
far
from
over
launched
to
investigate
contracting
graft
at
petrobras
the
probe
and
resulting
trials
have
toppled
scores
of
powerful
business
and
political
figures
including
construction
industry
moguls
and
former
presidents
of
brazil
and
peru
foreign
oil
companies
are
now
in
the
cross
hairs
said
prosecutor
athayde
ribeiro
costa
who
is
heading
the
latest
phase
of
the
probe
costa
told
reuters
that
any
firm
that
has
done
business
with
petrobras
since
would
come
under
intense
scrutiny
he
added
that
other
major
firms
have
approached
brazilian
prosecutors
to
sound
them
out
about
leniency
deals
