zimbabwe
s
main
opposition
leader
on
wednesday
said
he
feared
the
government
would
use
a
blast
that
hit
a
weekend
rally
by
president
emmerson
mnangagwa
as
an
excuse
to
clamp
down
on
opponents
ahead
of
a
july
vote
mnangagwa
is
the
election
favourite
and
a
spokesman
for
his
ruling
party
simon
moyo
said
the
government
was
not
planning
any
clampdown
nelson
chamisa
leader
of
the
movement
for
democratic
change
mdc
which
has
formed
a
poll
alliance
with
smaller
parties
said
mnangagwa
was
leading
an
unstable
government
without
capacity
to
resolve
zimbabwe
s
problems
including
the
economy
we
know
that
they
would
also
want
to
use
that
as
a
pretext
to
clamp
down
on
the
opposition
they
would
want
to
use
it
to
start
targeting
certain
individuals
certain
candidates
that
they
perceive
to
be
their
credible
opposition
chamisa
told
reuters
in
an
interview
mnangagwa
blamed
a
faction
loyal
to
former
leader
robert
mugabe
s
wife
grace
for
the
attempt
on
his
life
in
bulawayo
city
and
has
said
the
government
is
taking
steps
to
ensure
peace
endures
two
people
died
and
dozens
were
injured
in
the
explosion
the
presidential
and
parliamentary
vote
is
the
first
since
mugabe
was
forced
to
resign
in
november
after
a
coup
it
is
seen
as
a
contest
between
generations
chamisa
said
he
was
confident
he
would
form
the
next
government
which
would
include
elements
but
complained
the
electoral
field
was
tilted
in
mnangagwa
s
favour
he
said
the
mdc
was
worried
about
ghost
voters
on
the
poll
register
and
was
also
concerned
over
which
firm
would
be
granted
the
contract
to
print
the
ballots
he
said
the
army
should
publicly
declare
it
would
respect
the
result
even
if
mnangagwa
lost
the
military
remains
averse
to
any
leader
who
was
not
part
of
the
liberation
war
against
white
rule
analysts
say
while
zimbabwe
lacks
a
reliable
polling
system
an
unofficial
survey
released
early
this
month
in
bulawayo
by
the
mass
public
opinion
institute
put
mnangagwa
s
popularity
on
percent
against
chamisa
s
percent
the
survey
showed
that
a
large
group
percent
declined
to
disclose
a
preference
the
institute
will
publish
another
survey
just
before
the
vote
chamisa
whose
party
has
promised
to
revive
the
economy
said
his
government
would
review
all
investment
deals
signed
by
the
government
to
ensure
zimbabwe
did
not
lose
out
platinum
and
coal
deals
are
among
those
that
would
be
scrutinised
chamisa
said
adding
he
would
seek
better
trade
terms
with
china
a
big
investor
in
the
country
zimbabwe
signed
a
billion
platinum
deal
with
a
cypriot
investor
karo
resources
in
march
and
is
developing
a
billion
platinum
joint
venture
with
russian
partners
we
need
to
investigate
to
see
what
was
involved
chamisa
said
referring
to
the
coal
and
platinum
deals
he
said
he
was
not
afraid
to
antagonise
powerful
forces
i
am
not
worried
about
the
anger
of
dealers
we
do
not
want
dealers
in
zimbabwe
we
want
investors
he
said
arguing
that
some
of
the
investors
were
mere
dealmakers
