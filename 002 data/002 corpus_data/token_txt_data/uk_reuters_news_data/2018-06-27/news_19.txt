update 1-canada cannot start work on trans mountain pipeline until deal closes -minister
washington
reuters
the
canadian
government
would
like
to
see
construction
accelerate
on
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
expansion
but
has
no
control
over
decisions
to
resume
or
start
new
work
until
it
takes
ownership
of
the
major
crude
oil
pipeline
project
canada
s
natural
resources
minister
said
we
think
that
construction
and
staying
on
a
schedule
is
important
but
that
will
be
up
to
kinder
morgan
as
long
as
they
are
the
owner
of
the
pipeline
jim
carr
said
in
an
interview
in
washington
where
he
is
attending
the
world
gas
conference
carr
said
he
expects
the
deal
to
close
in
mid
to
late
the
canadian
government
agreed
to
buy
kinder
morgan
canada
ltd
s
trans
mountain
pipeline
and
project
for
c
billion
billion
in
late
may
promising
the
deal
would
allow
work
on
the
massive
expansion
to
begin
immediately
kinder
morgan
halted
all
work
on
the
c
billion
project
earlier
in
may
citing
regulatory
uncertainty
and
opposition
from
the
province
of
british
columbia
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
runs
from
edmonton
alberta
to
a
deepwater
port
in
the
vancouver
area
the
expansion
would
nearly
triple
its
capacity
giving
canadian
producers
greater
access
to
asia
and
other
world
markets
we
know
that
expanding
export
markets
is
a
good
idea
and
that
has
been
reinforced
by
recent
events
said
carr
noting
that
percent
of
canada
s
oil
and
gas
exports
go
to
the
united
states
canada
s
oil
producers
who
currently
sell
their
crude
at
a
steep
discount
to
the
north
american
benchmark
are
desperate
for
construction
to
begin
some
aboriginal
groups
and
the
province
of
british
columbia
fiercely
oppose
the
expansion
on
wednesday
kinder
morgan
said
it
is
seeking
permits
to
start
work
on
its
burnaby
terminal
expansion
a
major
component
of
the
project
it
has
previously
said
that
work
is
underway
at
its
westridge
marine
terminal
it
did
not
provide
an
updated
construction
schedule
under
the
current
schedule
terminal
construction
should
already
be
well
underway
with
pipeline
construction
starting
in
july
the
anticipated
date
is
december
though
it
was
unclear
if
that
was
still
attainable
we
think
that
there
s
value
in
having
the
construction
schedule
accelerate
but
until
we
own
the
project
we
can
t
control
that
carr
told
reuters
the
government
does
not
intend
to
own
the
pipeline
for
long
and
is
looking
for
a
new
buyer
canadian
dollars
