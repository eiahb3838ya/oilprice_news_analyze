rpt-update 1-japan's tohoku elec, glencore abandon april-march coal contract talks
tokyo
reuters
japan
s
tohoku
electric
power
co
inc
and
glencore
plc
have
abandoned
talks
on
annual
thermal
coal
supplies
after
failing
to
reach
an
agreement
the
first
time
in
decades
the
talks
have
broken
down
tohoku
electric
said
on
tuesday
that
the
negotiations
with
glencore
the
world
s
biggest
exporter
of
seaborne
thermal
coal
ended
without
an
agreement
after
protracted
negotiations
on
supplies
from
april
to
march
we
could
not
reach
an
agreement
with
glencore
on
the
april
to
march
annual
contract
a
spokesman
for
the
japanese
utility
company
said
citing
their
inability
to
agree
on
terms
such
as
price
and
volume
we
will
negotiate
with
glencore
for
other
contracts
of
coal
as
needed
he
said
adding
that
tohoku
has
settled
some
annual
contracts
with
other
australian
suppliers
a
glencore
spokesman
in
australia
said
no
comment
when
contacted
by
reuters
but
a
senior
glencore
official
who
declined
to
be
identified
said
the
talks
failed
because
of
price
disagreements
so
they
decided
to
skip
this
round
and
tohoku
has
already
covered
its
needs
multiple
industry
sources
said
the
producer
and
the
utility
were
not
able
to
reach
an
agreement
on
pricing
as
tohoku
like
its
peers
is
seeking
to
cut
costs
amid
increased
competition
in
japan
s
electricity
market
benchmark
thermal
coal
prices
also
surged
to
their
highest
since
while
the
negotiations
were
taking
place
making
the
talks
more
complex
the
sources
said
the
price
for
thermal
coal
agreed
to
by
tohoku
and
glencore
is
used
as
a
benchmark
for
other
japanese
utilities
and
manufacturers
and
the
breakdown
in
talks
surprised
other
coal
buyers
this
is
the
first
time
in
my
memory
that
the
talks
over
an
annual
coal
contract
between
a
japanese
major
utility
and
a
key
australian
supplier
were
broken
off
said
a
coal
buyer
with
more
than
three
decades
of
experience
the
absence
of
the
reference
price
means
that
other
buyers
will
need
to
negotiate
with
their
suppliers
without
any
guidance
a
coal
trader
based
in
tokyo
said
the
april
to
march
contracts
between
australian
suppliers
and
japanese
utilities
have
traditionally
accounted
for
a
major
part
of
japan
s
annual
thermal
coal
imports
of
about
million
tonnes
but
the
volume
under
the
contracts
has
been
declining
in
recent
years
as
utilities
tried
to
diversify
their
sources
according
to
multiple
industry
sources
japanese
utilities
usually
pay
a
premium
to
secure
supplies
from
australia
on
contracts
as
they
prefer
coal
with
a
higher
energy
content
to
generate
electricity
more
efficiently
and
with
less
environmental
harm
