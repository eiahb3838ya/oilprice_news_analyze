the
united
states
has
told
countries
to
cut
imports
of
iranian
oil
to
zero
from
november
a
senior
state
department
official
said
on
tuesday
oil
prices
were
flying
higher
overnight
after
catching
an
updraft
from
the
administration
calling
for
allies
to
cut
iran
imports
to
zero
tolerance
said
stephen
innes
head
of
trading
for
at
futures
brokerage
oanda
he
also
warned
libya
will
continue
to
be
a
significant
point
of
concern
in
the
oil
supply
chain
a
power
struggle
between
the
official
government
and
rebels
has
left
it
unclear
who
will
handle
libya
s
large
oil
reserves
although
as
of
late
tuesday
sources
said
the
country
s
oil
ports
of
hariga
and
zueitina
in
eastern
libya
appeared
to
be
working
normally
for
north
america
innes
said
the
market
continues
to
focus
on
syncrude
canada
where
barrels
per
day
bpd
remain
in
limbo
after
a
transformer
blew
and
shut
a
critical
oil
sands
upgrader
on
june
he
added
that
repairs
would
likely
last
until
the
end
of
july
innes
said
the
outage
had
contributed
to
a
major
draw
in
crude
oil
inventories
the
american
petroleum
institute
api
on
tuesday
reported
a
million
barrel
reduction
in
crude
inventories
in
the
week
to
june
to
million
barrels
trying
to
make
up
for
disrupted
supply
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
a
group
of
partners
including
top
producer
opec
said
late
last
week
they
would
increase
output
top

opec
leader
saudi
arabia
plans
to
pump
up
to
million
bpd
in
july
the
highest
in
its
history
up
from
about
million
bpd
in
june
an
industry
source
familiar
with
saudi
oil
production
plans
told
reuters
on
tuesday
the
agreement
to
elevate
output
still
leaves
production
restraints
in
place
limiting
the
market
s
ability
to
rebuild
inventories
while
decreasing
spare
production
capacity
said
french
bank
bnp
paribas
it
also
said
rising
oil
production
could
be
prevented
from
being
exported
until
pipeline
capacity
was
expanded
next
year
considering
significant
future
supply
losses
faced
by
iran
under
sanctions
and
supply
risks
in
venezuela
and
libya
oil
fundamentals
still
remain
favourable
for
oil
prices
to
rise
over
the
next
months
despite
the
decision
