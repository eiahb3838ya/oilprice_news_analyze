reuters
oil
prices
jumped
on
wednesday
as
plunging
crude
stockpiles
compounded
supply
worries
in
a
market
already
uncertain
about
libyan
exports
a
production
disruption
in
canada
and
washington
s
demands
that
importers
stop
buying
iranian
crude
from
november
little
spare
capacity
remains
to
offset
any
further
production
disruptions
said
john
kilduff
a
partner
at
again
capital
management
the
bulls
will
run
the
table
and
are
going
to
be
helped
out
by
random
events
that
will
come
out
of
left
field
and
keep
this
thing
going
kilduff
said
crude
futures
rose
or
percent
to
settle
at
a
barrel
the
contract
touched
a
barrel
the
highest
since
brent
crude
rose
or

both
contracts
pared
gains
in
trade
crude
was
up
at
a
barrel
and
brent
trading
up
cents
at
a
barrel
by

gmt
because
prices
gained
sharply
for
two
straight
sessions
some
long
positions
were
exiting
the
market
to
capitalize
on
the
move
as
the
end
of
the

approaches

crude
stocks
fell
nearly
million
barrels
last
week
the
most
since
while
gasoline
and
distillate
inventories
rose
less
than
expected
the
energy
information
administration
said
crude
stocks
at
the
cushing
oklahoma
delivery
hub
for
the
nymex

contract
fell
million

eia
said
cushing
is
a
whopper
said
bob
yawger
director
of
energy
futures
at
mizuho
the
reported
cushing
draw
reflected
just
one
day
of
a
production
disruption
at
a
supplier
in
canada
syncrude
s
oil
sands
facility
was
offline
at
least
through
july
after
a
power
outage
last
week
locked
in
bpd
next
week
you
re
going
to
have
a
cushing
storage
number
that
includes
seven
days
of
the
syncude
outage
the
math
there
would
imply
that
you
d
get
an
even
bigger
draw
than
this
week
yawger
said
the
crude
contract
traded
at
above
the
contract
the
most
since
july
this
encourages
further
drawdowns
from
storage
the
fall
in
canadian
exports
helped
drain
supplies
of
heavy
crude
across
north
america
analysts
said
they
also
cited
concern
about
the
risk
of
a
disruption
to
supplies
from
africa
and
the
middle
east
in
libya
a
power
struggle
has
left
it
unclear
whether
the
internationally
recognised
government
or
rebels
will
handle
oil
exports
the
future
of
iranian
crude
exports
was
also
in
doubt
the
united
states
has
told
all
countries
to
stop
importing
iranian
oil
from
november
trying
to
make
up
for
disrupted
supply
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
said
last
week
it
would
increase
output
saudi
arabia
plans
to
pump
a
record
million
bpd
in
july
up
from
million
bpd
in
june
an
industry
source
familiar
with
saudi
plans
told
reuters
on
tuesday
despite
widespread
international
opposition
to
the
stance
on
iran
analysts
expect
a
significant
reduction
in
exports
from
opec
s
third
biggest
producer
perhaps
in
excess
of
million
bpd

the
