confusion
still
reigned
over
trade
policy
the
house
of
representatives
overwhelmingly
passed
a
bill
on
tuesday
to
tighten
foreign

rules
spurred
by
bipartisan
concerns
about
chinese
bids

president
donald
trump
also
endorsed
a
measured
approach
to
restricting
chinese
investments
in

a

could

we
remain

a

probability
though
the
odds
of

happening
appear
to
have
increased
said
jpmorgan
economist
david
hensley
he
noted
that
the
latest
tariff
threats
from
the
white
house
would
cover
more
than
percent
of
imports
equal
to
almost
percent
of
annual
economic
output
gdp
if
all
this
were
to
happen
and
trading
partners
were
to
retaliate
it
would
deliver
a
significant
supply
shock
to
the
world
economy
raising
inflation
and
lowering
in
currency
markets
the
dollar
regained
some
ground
though
investors
remained
unsure
whether
the
on
tariffs
would
ultimately
prove
bullish
or
bearish
for
the
currency
measured
against
a
basket
of

the

had
also
rallied
to
yen
though
that
just
left
it
in
the
middle
of
the
recent
trading
range
the
dollar
was
aided
in
part
by
recent
gains
on
the
chinese
yuan
which
had
stirred
speculation
beijing
was
weakening
its

to
bolster
exports
the

climbed
