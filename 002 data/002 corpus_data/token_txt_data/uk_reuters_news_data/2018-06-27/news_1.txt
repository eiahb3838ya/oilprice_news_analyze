east
libyan
officials
said
on
wednesday
they
would
send
oil
revenue
from
areas
under
their
control
to
a
central
bank
based
in
the
east
defying
pressure
to
return
recently
recaptured
ports
to
the
internationally
recognised
state
oil
firm
the
comments
were
made
as
a
parallel
national
oil
corporation
noc
in
the
eastern
city
of
benghazi
said
it
had
formally
taken
delivery
of
eastern
oil
ports
at
a
ceremony
at
es
sider
terminal
it
is
unclear
whether
the
benghazi
noc
will
be
able
to
export
any
oil
despite
the
libyan
national
army
lna
promising
them
control
of
all
eastern
ports
and
fields
but
the
move
has
created
deep
uncertainty
over
opec
member
libya
s
oil
production
and
risks
deepening
a
split
between
factions
based
in
the
east
and
west
of
the
country
the
ceremony
at
es
sider
was
attended
by
representatives
of
libya
s
parliament
and
government
which
are
aligned
with
the
lna
and
oppose
the
internationally
backed
government
of
national
accord
gna
in
the
capital
tripoli
noc
benghazi
head
faraj
said
who
was
also
present
called
it
a
happy
and
historic
day
we
undertake
that
the
money
won
t
go
to
someone
shorn
of
legitimacy
he
said
a
reference
to
tripoli
central
bank
head
sadiq
whom
eastern
factions
have
repeatedly
tried
to
oust
we
have
a
central
bank
in
the
eastern
town
of
bayda
and
it
is
recognised
by
the
libyan
es
sider
and
the
neighbouring
terminal
of
ras
lanuf
have
been
under
lna
control
since
it
let
the
tripoli
noc
operate
the
ports
along
with
other
eastern
oil
facilities
with
revenue
flowing
to
the
tripoli
central
bank
but
after
fighting
off
the
latest
in
a
series
of
attempts
by
their
opponents
to
seize
the
ports
the
lna
said
on
monday
that
this
time
they
would
hand
ras
lanuf
es
sider
and
other
eastern
ports
and
fields
to
noc
benghazi
instead
eastern
government
spokesman
hatem
said
all
previous
oil
contracts
would
be
respected
but
eastern
authorities
had
taken
the
step
because
oil
revenue
had
been
going
to
militias
and
extremist
groups
in
the
past
western
powers
have
prevented
noc
benghazi
from
exporting
oil
independently
of
tripoli
under
security
council
resolutions
that
give
power
over
oil
exports
to
the
gna
and
noc
in
the
capital
on
wednesday
the
united
states
france
britain
and
italy
said
in
a
joint
statement
they
were
deeply
concerned
by
the
lna
s
offer
of
oil
facilities
to
noc
benghazi
and
that
the
international
community
would
hold
those
who
undermine
libya
s
peace
security
and
stability
to
account
secretary
general
antonio
guterres
called
for
the
return
of
oil
resources
production
and
revenue
to
the
control
of
the
recognised
libyan
authorities
