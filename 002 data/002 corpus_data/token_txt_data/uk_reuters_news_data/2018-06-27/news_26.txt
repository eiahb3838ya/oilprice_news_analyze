to
emerge
from
bankruptcy
with
sufficient
equity
in

and
is
targeting
saudi
arabia
and
india
for
new
reactor
sales
its
ceo
said
canada
s
brookfield
asset
management
in
january
agreed
to
buy
westinghouse
from
toshiba
for
billion
after
cost
overruns
on
reactors
pushed
the
atomic
energy
pioneer
into
bankruptcy
in
march
westinghouse
ceo
jose
gutierrez
said
the
brookfield
deal
would
close
as
soon
as
it
had
been
approved
by
and
british
nuclear
regulators
and
the
committee
on
foreign
investment
in
the
united
states
cfius
we
are
confident
we
will
get
those
approvals
in
the
next
few
weeks
we
don
t
see
any
roadblocks
gutierrez
told
reuters
at
the
world
nuclear
exhibition
in
paris
once
the
deal
is
closed
westinghouse
will
officially
emerge
from
bankruptcy
and
brookfield
will
recapitalise
the
firm
we
will
have
the
right
capital
structure
and
the
necessary
cash
for
running
our
business
gutierrez
said
the
amount
of
money
to
be
injected
is
under
discussion
westinghouse
hopes
sales
will
get
a
boost
when
the
first
of
four
reactors
in
china
starts
up
this
year
gutierrez
said
fuel
had
been
loaded
in
the
haiyang
reactor
on
tuesday
and
the
sanmen
reactor
was
waiting
for
permission
to
load
fuel
the
haiyang
had
finished
hot
functional
testing
and
would
be
ready
to
load
fuel
soon
he
said
sanmen
in
zhejiang
province
loaded
fuel
in
april
ran
its
first
nuclear
reactions
in
june
and
is
set
for
commercial
operation
by
november
chinese
authorities
said
this
month
contracts
for
the
four
reactors
two
at
sanmen
and
two
at
haiyang
in
shandong
province
were
signed
in
the
first
one
had
been
scheduled
to
launch
in
gutierrez
said
chinese
authorities
expect
two
or
maybe
three
will
connect
to
the
grid
before
end
of
projects
for
six
more
in
china
are
pending
and
westinghouse
expects
china
will
build
a
fleet
of
at
least
in
the
coming
decade
as
westinghouse
has
transferred
the
technology
to
china
it
will
not
benefit
from
new
builds
but
expects
to
earn
money
on
providing
fuel
and
maintenance
about
percent
of
westinghouse
revenue
comes
from
fuel
and
services
only
about
percent
from
building
new
reactors
not
having
a
working
has
hampered
westinghouse
and
other
vendors
have
won
major
tenders
instead
this
month
russia
s
rosatom
stole
a
march
on
westinghouse
with
a
contract
to
sell
four
reactors
two
of
those
will
be
built
at
xudaobao
in
northeast
china
on
a
site
once
earmarked
for
westinghouse
in
april
westinghouse
received
strong
support
from
energy
secretary
rick
perry
for
its
plan
to
build
six
in
india
a
massive
project
set
in
motion
by
a
agreement
years
ago
but
since
toshiba
will
no
longer
act
as
master
builder
there
are
doubts
about
the
plan
now
that
we
are
emerging
from
chapter
we
are
resuming
conversations
with
india
gutierrez
said
westinghouse
is
also
waiting
for
saudi
arabia
to
decide
on
a
shortlist
of
two
to
three
bidders
to
build
two
nuclear
plants
besides
westinghouse
companies
from
russia
france
china
and
south
korea
are
in
the
running
it
is
a
reality
that
the
other
four
bidders
are
countries
and
we
are
a
private
company
gutierrez
said
adding
that
he
was
confident
that
westinghouse
would
be
on
the
shortlist
the
saudi
authorities
had
been
due
to
decide
at
the
end
of
march
once
the
shortlist
is
made
bidders
will
discuss
business
models
and
financing
a
process
that
will
take
at
least
another
year
before
saudi
arabia
picks
a
winner
gutierrez
said
that
during
its
bankruptcy
westinghouse
which
sells
services
fuel
and
spare
parts
to
almost
percent
of
world
s
reactors
had
not
lost
a
single
contract
gutierrez
had
no
news
on
toshiba
s
attempts
to
sell
its
nugen
unit
which
has
a
project
to
build
reactors
in
britain
westinghouse
is
also
working
on
finalising
two
reactors
in
vogtle
georgia
by
two
other
under
construction
in
the
united
states
were
abandoned
as
costs
got
out
of
hand
