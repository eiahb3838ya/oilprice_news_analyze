delta
air
lines
is
expecting
billion
in
additional
costs
this
year
due
to
the
swelling
expense
of
jet
fuel
chief
executive
officer
ed
bastian
said
on
twitter
on
wednesday
earlier
this
month
delta
blamed
a
percent
annual
rise
in
fuel
costs
for
its
decision
to
lower
its
second
quarter
profit
forecast
to
between
and
per
share
from
a
previous
estimate
of
up
to
per
share
the
rising
cost
of
jet
fuel
already
weighed
on
airlines
earnings
in
the
first
quarter
and
prompted
rival
american
airlines
to
cut
its
profit
forecast
in
april
delta
and
its
competitors
are
hoping
strong
demand
higher
ticket
prices
and
benefits
from
reductions
in
the
corporate
tax
rate
will
eventually
offset
the
impact
of
higher
fuel
prices
delta
s
shares
were
down
about
percent
at
in
afternoon
trading
slightly
underperforming
a
