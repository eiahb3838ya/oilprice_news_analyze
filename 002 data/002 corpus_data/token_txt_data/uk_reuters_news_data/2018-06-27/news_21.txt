natural
gas
production
from
shale
fields
can
keep
growing
for
decades
giving
washington
a
powerful
diplomatic
tool
to
counter
the
geopolitical
influence
of
other
energy
exporters
such
as
russia
industry
executives
and
government
officials
said
at
a
conference
here
already
the
world
s
largest
gas
producer
the
united
states
can
expand
shale
gas
output
another
percent
in
the
coming
decades
according
to
at
least
one
estimate
so
far
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
has
been
spared
from
retaliatory
tariffs
in
president
donald
trump
s
intensifying
trade
conflicts
with
china
and
other
countries
we
see
a
century
of
natural
gas
supply
in
shale
ryan
lance
chief
executive
of
shale
producer
conocophillips
said
this
week
at
the
triennial
world
gas
conference
in
washington
shale
s
abundance
is
real
and
it
s
not
going
the
united
states
currently
produces
about
billion
cubic
feet
bcf
of
natural
gas
each
day
a
figure
that
is
expected
to
grow
by
bcf
per
day
this
year
and
within
years
shale
gas
output
should
grow
an
additional
percent
according
to
a
study
from
ihs
markit
ltd
while
trump
s
tariffs
against
china
europe
mexico
canada
and
others
have
cast
a
pall
over
washington
s
energy
ambitions
the
administration
has
repeatedly
said
it
is
eager
to
expand
fossil
fuel
supplies
to
global
allies
through
supply
agreements
and
technology
sharing
trump
is
also
rolling
back
domestic
regulations
to
encourage
more
oil
and
gas
production
the
strategy
which
trump
dubs
energy
dominance
is
aimed
at
making
the
united
states
a
viable
alternative
to
rival
energy
producers
like
russia
as
washington
seeks
to
forge
bonds
with
big
consumers
like
china
we
re
sharing
our
energy
value
with
the
world
rick
perry
the
secretary
of
energy
said
this
week
at
the
conference
conoco
and
its
peers
have
sharply
ramped
up
natural
gas
production
in
the
past
decade
using
hydraulic
fracturing
technology
to
tap
shale
fields
in
texas
pennsylvania
and
elsewhere
the
united
states
is
also
boosting
export
capacity
lng
facilities
from
cheniere
energy
inc
tellurian
inc
and
others
are
either
operating
or
planned
across
the
gulf
coast
what
the
has
done
for
the
world
with
shale
gas
is
given
another
form
of
affordable
competitive
energy
that
can
be
relied
upon
said
jack

cheniere

said
at
the

cheniere
one
of
the
largest
exporters
of
natural
gas
has
shipped
more
than
lng
cargos
to
countries
around
the
globe
including
china
gas
is
much
more
of
a
global
market
than
it
used
to
be
dan

an
energy
economist
and
ihs
markit
vice
chairman
said
at
the
conference
this
week
the
in
shale
gas
production
coincides
with
a
demand
spike
from
power
producers
with
generation
increasingly
anathema
across
the
developing
world
industry
executives
have
aggressively
touted
gas
as
a
way
to
increase
access
to
affordable
electricity
and
limit
greenhouse

emissions
this

gale
has
boosted
the

triple
its

has

unnoticed
by
major

with
south

china
and
others
eager
for
stable
fuel
sources
there
