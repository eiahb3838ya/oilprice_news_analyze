to
bring

police
clashing
with

public
demonstrations
are
rare
in
iran
but
in
recent
months
there
have
been
several
over
the
state
of
the
economy
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
the
hardline
cleric
in
power
since
demanded
the
judiciary
punish
those
who
disrupt
economic
security
in
remarks
clearly
intended
to
send
a
message
to
iranians
who
may
plan
more
demonstrations
the
atmosphere
for
the
work
life
and
livelihood
of
the
people
must
be
secure
he
said
in
a
meeting
with
judiciary
officials
according
to
his
official
website
and
the
judiciary
must
confront
those
who
disrupt
economic
the
bazaar
strike
is
the
biggest
sign
of
domestic
disquiet
in
iran
since
the
united
states
abandoned
a
deal
to
lift
economic
sanctions
in
return
for
curbs
to
tehran
s
nuclear
program
the
deal
was
the
centerpiece
of
rouhani
s
plans
to
open
iran
s
economy
which
won
him
two
landslide
elections
but
has
yet
to
bring
widespread
economic
benefits
for
many
iranians
washington
has
pledged
even
tighter
sanctions
than
before
although
its
european
allies
and
other
world
powers
say
they
still
support
the
nuclear
deal
we
will
take
problems
we
will
take
pressure
but
we
will
not
sacrifice
our
independence
said
rouhani
in
an
address
broadcast
on
state
television
in
the
latest
push
against
tehran
a
senior
official
said
on
tuesday
that
countries
buying
oil
from
iran
should
prepare
to
halt
all
imports
of
it
starting
in
november
or
face
punishment
the
threat
of
restored
sanctions
has
caused
the
rial
to
collapse
hurting
business
by
driving
up
the
cost
of
imports
the
rial
traded
at
against
the
dollar
in
the
unofficial
market
on
wednesday
according
to
foreign
exchange
website
this
compares
to
around
at
the
end
of
last
year
it
should
surprise
no
one
iranprotests
continue
people
are
tired
of
the
corruption
injustice
incompetence
of
their
leaders
the
world
hears
their
voice
tweeted
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
an
iranian
oil
official
dismissed
efforts
to
squeeze
iran
s
oil
industry
iran
exports
a
total
amount
of
million
barrels
per
day
of
crude
and
condensate
and
eliminating
it
easily
and
in
a
period
of
a
few
months
is
impossible
the
official
told
the
tasnim
news
agency
trump
s
determination
to
deprive
iran
of
funding
raises
the
stakes
for
rouhani
who
has
attempted
to
appease
anger
over
his
government
s
handling
of
the
economy
the
iranian
parliament
showed
the
level
of
discontent
over
rouhani
s
performance
issuing
a
letter
signed
by
representatives
more
than
half
of
the
total
asking
that
the
president
change
his
administration
s
economic
team
mehrdad
emadi
an
iranian
economist
who
heads
energy
risk
analysis
at
london
s
betamatrix
consultancy
estimated
sanctions
could
cause
iran
s
crude
oil
exports
to
drop
by
between
and
bpd
in
coming
months
he
said
a
fall
below
million
bpd
the
level
two
years
ago
before
the
nuclear
deal
was
unlikely
as
iran
would
remain
able
to
sell
some
oil
abroad
through
barter
deals
turkey
said
on
wednesday
it
did
not
consider
itself
bound
by
the
effort
to
stop
iran
exporting
oil
but
the
sanctions
may
stifle
iran
s
plans
to
expand
its
oil
industry
after
a
deal
reached
this
month
among
global
oil
producers
to
raise
output
saudi
arabia
and
russia
look
set
to
take
market
share
from
iran
iran
is
in
a
weaker
position
to
cope
with
these
sanctions
than
it
was
during
the
last
sanctions
period
two
years
ago
emadi
said
then
iran
had
some
billion
of
currency
stored
abroad
in
countries
such
as
china
and
turkey
as
well
as
european
banks
detailed
figures
for
foreign
exchange
reserves
are
secret
but
tehran
has
now
drawn
down
much
of
that
buffer
to
handle
expenses
such
as
capital
flight
and
foreign
intervention
emadi
said
he
predicted
iran
might
ultimately
enter
a
fresh
recession
as
lower
oil
revenues
prompted
the
government
to
put
public
sector
projects
on
hold
and
as
the
economy
became
more
militarized
in
response
to
pressure
a
downturn
in
growth
could
worsen
bad
debt
problems
in
the
banking
sector
which
the
international
monetary
fund
has
warned
could
destabilize
the
economy
