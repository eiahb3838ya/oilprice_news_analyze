a
percent
slide
in
chinese
equities
on
wednesday
and
a
fresh
weakening
in
the
yuan
highlighted
mounting
stress
on
the
world
s
number
two
economy
from
trade
tensions
with
the
united
states
while
global
stocks
slipped
to
approach
lows
equity
futures
signalled
a
weaker
opening
for
wall
street
with
s
p
down
percent
following
sharp
losses
in
asia
and
europe
after
news
the
house
of
representatives
had
approved
tightening
foreign
investment
rules
the
nasdaq
and
dow
jones
indexes
also
are
poised
to
open
lower
and
while
the
prospect
of
trade
protectionism
and
tariffs
hammers
equities
and
raises
fears
for
the
world
economy
the
growth
and
inflation
outlook
is
further
complicated
by
oil
prices
rising
back
above
per
barrel
due
to
washington
pressuring
its
allies
to
halt
iranian
imports
oil
s
rise
despite
last
week
s
deal
by
crude
producers
to
raise
output
had
helped
wall
street
rebound
on
tuesday
but
the
rally
fizzled
in
asian
trading
driving
msci
s
asian
equity
index
almost
one
percent
lower
to
a
fresh
low
losses
were
led
by
china
where
blue
chips
sank
percent
to
stand
a
whisker
above
lows
chinese
equities
have
now
fallen
into
bear
market
territory
having
tumbled
percent
from
recent
peaks
the
yuan
too
slipped
to
a
fresh
low
against
the
dollar
as
the
central
bank
allowed
the
biggest
weakening
in
the
currency
in
percentage
terms
since
january
many
analysts
now
see
authorities
allowing
currency
weakness
in
order
to
counter
the
hit
to
trade
in
contrast
the
s
is
just
percent
off
peaks
after
a
lot
of
we
are
seeing
shanghai
suffering
a
lot
more
than
wall
street
so
clearly
the
first
round
of
trade
war
has
been
won
by
america
unfortunately
that
then
overflows
into
emerging
markets
and
europe
said
peter
lowman
chief
investment
officer
at
uk
wealth
manager
investment
quorum
lowman
said
a
equity
bullmarket
had
left
many
assets
priced
for
perfection
meaning
setbacks
could
have
an
outsize
impact
especially
because
central
banks
led
by
the
federal
reserve
are
tightening
policy
after
years
of
interest
rates
oil
trading
near
is
going
to
put
pressure
on
inflation
around
the
world
which
means
central
bank
policy
may
have
to
tighten
quicker
than
expected
lowman
added
the
iran
supply
worries
have
overshadowed
a
supply
increase
agreed
by
opec
and
other
oil
producers
last
week
pushing
brent
futures
more
than
half
a
cent
higher
to
a
barrel
european
shares
meanwhile
touched
lows
later
recouping
some
losses
as
auto
shares
vulnerable
to
tariffs
trimmed
some
big
early
falls
many
investors
still
caution
against
reading
too
much
into
the
trade
fallout
citing
robust
global
growth
and
hopes
of
an
ultimately
pragmatic
approach
by
leaders
on
the
trade
issue
we
still
have
fundamental
macro
drivers
it
s
very
much
a
between
fundamentals
mattering
more
versus
political
factors
kristina
hooper
global
chief
market
strategist
at
invesco
said
nevertheless
assets
including
currencies
continue
to
feel
the
heat
the
australian
dollar
traded
towards
lows
hit
recently
and
the
new
zealand
dollar
touched
seven
month
lows
to
the
dollar
the
greenback
itself
recovered
from
lows
but
fell
percent
against
japan
s
yen
which
is
considered
a
asset
bonds
also
gained
from
the
turmoil
with
treasury
yields
slipping
basis
points
to
around
percent
a
month
low
but
fears
of
an
inflationary
impact
from
the
trade
tensions
and
oil
prices
have
flattened
the
yield
curve
with
the
yield
gap
between
and
treasuries
narrowing
to
a
new
political
concerns
in
europe
are
also
worrying
investors
at
the
margin
as
a
row
over
migration
policy
in
germany
s
coalition
government
rumbled
on
raising
concerns
that
the
euro
zone
s
biggest
economy
could
be
headed
for
snap
elections
that
also
contributed
to
pushing
euro
zone
yields
lower
with
german
yields
edging
towards
lows
