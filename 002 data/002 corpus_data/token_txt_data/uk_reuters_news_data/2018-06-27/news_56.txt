the

while

supplies
were
not
mentioned
by

the
threat
of
losing

looms
over
both
countries

react
strongly
as
traders
had
anticipated
washington
s
move
and
largely
priced
in
the
stance
this
more
aggressive
tack
from
the
trump
administration
likely
means
japan

south
korea
will
move
more
quickly
to
their
imports
from
iran

on
the
