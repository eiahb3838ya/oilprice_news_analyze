production
at
the
groningen
natural
gas
field
will
be
lower
than
originally
envisaged
this
year
as
the
dutch
government
works
towards
the
end
of
extraction
in
the
next
decade
because
of
the
risk
of
earthquakes
output
will
have
fallen
to
between
and
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
in
the
year
ending
october
the
dutch
gas
sector
regulator
said
on
wednesday
lower
than
the
original
cap
of
bcm
set
for
the
year
and
down
from
bcm
last
year
the
dutch
government
will
end
production
in
groningen
completely
by
it
said
in
march
as
it
tries
to
limit
seismic
risks
in
the
region
as
a
first
step
it
promised
to
reduce
production
to
less
than
bcm
as
quickly
as
possible
in
the
coming
years
as
that
level
would
significantly
reduce
the
risks
of
earthquakes
that
level
could
be
reached
by
economy
minister
eric
wiebes
said
this
month
mainly
by
switching
large
industrial
users
from
groningen
gas
but
regulator
sodm
on
wednesday
said
more
measures
are
needed
to
ensure
that
goal
is
met
the
government
will
need
to
offer
financial
incentives
to
large
industrial
users
in
the
short
term
it
said
and
will
ultimately
have
to
ban
them
from
using
groningen
gas
completely
reducing
demand
from
large
users
is
critical
for
reducing
seismic
risks
sodm
director
theodor
kockelkoren
told
reporters
we
need
to
give
them
an
incentive
to
switch
and
we
need
to
be
clear
exactly
how
much
time
they
will
the
regulator
did
not
say
when
it
thought
factories
should
be
cut
off
from
groningen
gas
as
it
said
that
decision
was
up
to
the
government
