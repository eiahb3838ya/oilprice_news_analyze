when
a
south
african

boeing
took
off
from
tambo
international
airport
in
johannesburg
two
years
ago
headed
for
cape
town
it
was
powered
by
an
unusual
fuel
tobacco
south
africa
hasn
t
yet
repeated
the
jet
biofuel
feat
but
in
an
effort
to
cut
its
emissions
and
promote
greener
power
the
country
s
researchers
are
looking
for
innovative
ways
to
manufacture
green
aviation
fuel
at
larger
scale
a
new
waste

wing
project
aims
to
one
day
produce
a
significant
share
of
the
country
s
aviation
fuel
from
waste
plants
including
invasive
species
south
africa
produces
a
large
amount
of
agricultural
waste
as
well
as
waste
from
plantation
forestry
and
waste
biomass
from
alien
vegetation
clearing
programmes
said

an
energy

and
policy
specialist
for
the

wide
fund
for
nature
wwf
one
of
the
groups
involved
in
the
biofuel
push
so
far
the
effort
is
a
small
proof
of
concept
project
likely
to
produce
just
enough
jet
biofuel
for
one
more
flight
she
said
but
if
the
technology
works
production
could
be
scaled
up
significantly
perhaps
to
as
much
as
percent
of
the
aviation
fuel
used
at
johannesburg
s
international
airport
she
said
finding
clean
fuel
for
planes
ships
and
other
forms
of
transport
hard
to
plug
into
a
clean
energy
grid
remains
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
for
reducing
climate
changing
emissions
but
as
airlines
face
increasing
pressure
to
become
more
sustainable
countries
around
the
world
are
trying
to
find
solutions
from
hydrogen
powered
barges
to
in
south
africa
s
case
planes
that
could
fly
on
weeds
scaling
up
jet
biofuel
and
making
it
cost
effective
hasn
t
been
easy
however
farmers
in
south
africa
s
limpopo
province
today
continue
growing
solaris
a
tobacco
that
produces
large
amounts
of
oil
and
that
was
used
as
a
feedstock
for
the
country
s
first
flight
but
there
is
no
local
refining
capacity
available
and
the
sheer
scale
of
farming
needed
to
make
the
economies
of
scale
work
at
this
moment
in
time
is
difficult
merel
laroy
a
spokesman
for
skynrg
a
alternative
jet
fuel
supplier
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
one
of
the
lessons
learned
she
said
is
that
making
the
biofuel
locally
is
key
when
there
s
no
local
production
capacity
the
feedstock
must
be
shipped
out
of
the
country
and
shipped
back
after
refining
this
makes
the
sustainable
aviation
fuel
much
more
expensive
she
said
the
waste
to
wing
project
with
million
in
funding
from
the
european
union
s
switch
africa
green
programme
aims
to
solve
that
problem
and
cut
costs
and
protect
agricultural
production
and
forests
by
using
waste
to
create
fuel
the
effort
a
partnership
by
south
african
social
enterprise
fetola
wwf
and
skynrg
aims
to
create
a
clean
jet
fuel
supply
in
south
africa
a
country
with
a
long
history
of
developing
and
using
alternative
fuels
as
part
of
the
project
small
businesses
will
collect
and
supply
the
plant
matter
needed
to
make
the
biofuel
an
effort
to
create
jobs
in
a
country
with
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
unemployment
rates
amanda
dinan
fetola
s
project
manager
said
the
businesses
could
use
invasive
plants
collected
in
environmental
restoration
projects
and
currently
simply
stored
or
abandoned
as
the
raw
material
for
jet
fuel
such
stores
of
dried
plants
today
can
present
a
wildfire
risk
in
a
country
suffering
drought
so
are
often
purposely
burned
to
avoid
that
risk
she
said
but
the
waste
could
provide
jobs
in
its
harvesting
collection
and
transport
dinan
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
she
and
said
no
biomass
will
be
produced
for
being
converted
to
fuel
as
the
name
suggests
the
waste
to
wing
project
will
focus
on
waste
biomass
including
leftovers
from
food
and
livestock
feed
production
paper
making
and
furniture
production
said
at
the
moment
most
of
the
agricultural
waste
produced
in
the
country
is
burned
she
said
in
some
areas
harvested
invasive
plants
already
are
being
used
to
produce
charcoal
or
fibrous
products
such
as
coffins
but
most
of
the
waste
is
unused
she
said
and
only
that
unused
supply
will
be
diverted
to
the
jet
fuel
project
said
the
project
was
designed
to
stand
up
to
worsening
drought
linked
to
climate
change
in
southern
africa
and
ensure
land
isn
t
used
to
make
fuel
instead
south
africa
still
has
large
swathes
of
invasive
plants
to
clear
and
the
weeds
are
spreading
faster
than
they
can
be
cut
back
dinan
said
which
means
the
jet
fuel
project
could
both
aid
that
effort
and
is
unlikely
to
run
out
of
stock
to
make
fuel
sampson
mamphweli
director
of
the
centre
for
renewable
and
sustainable
energy
studies
at
stellenbosch
university
agreed
the
country
has
plenty
of
organic
waste
whether
they
use
organic
waste
or
they
plant
the
biomass
for
energy
whichever
way
the
project
is
worth
investigating
he
said
one
huge
challenge
with
such
projects
is
the
cost
of
transporting
plant
waste
so
material
would
need
to
be
sourced
as
close
as
possible
to
where
jet
biofuel
is
produced
mamphweli
said
and
the
cost
of
the
actual
biomass
material
is
also
a
big
factor
he
said
often
a
once
useless
and
free
material
becomes
valuable
when
there
is
a
use
for
it
he
said
said
it
was
too
soon
to
get
any
real
picture
of
how
much
of
south
africa
s
aviation
fuel
needs
might
be
met
by
the
project
but
our
previous
research
into
biomass
availability
suggests
that
technically
there
could
be
enough
biomass
to
meet
percent
of
our
aviation
fuel
demand
she
said
but
under
current
technology
the
biofuel
would
need
to
be
blended
with
conventional
jet
fuel
meaning
the
waste
technology
could
supply
at
best
half
of
the
country
s
needs
