the
last
three
years
fisherman
iputu
gede
astawa
has
watched
his
daily
catch
off
the
northern
tip
of
indonesia
s
bali
island
fall
at
an
alarming
rate
having
swapped
his
paddle
for
an
outboard
motor
in
a
futile
effort
to
fish
further
out
to
sea
where
waters
are
more
dangerous
astawa
blames
a
nearby
coal
power
plant
for
harming
his
livelihood
my
catch
is
totally
different
to
what
it
was
before
the
power
plant
began
operating
said
astawa
a
fisherman
based
near
the
port
town
of
singaraja
who
heads
a
group
of
about
other
fishermen
where
once
they
caught
buckets
of
fish
a
day
they
now
net
just
astawa
is
one
of
three
local
residents
fighting
a
legal
battle
to
stop
the
planned
expansion
of
the
celukan
bawang
power
plant
about
km
miles
from
the
main
tourism
hub
of
denpasar
which
began
operating
in
all
the
fishermen
will
be
impacted
and
we
will
lose
our
jobs
said
astawa
who
now
makes
furniture
to
get
by
the
legal
bid
backed
by
environmental
group
greenpeace
claims
the
planned
expansion
which
would
more
than
double
power
capacity
at
the
site
will
be
a
setback
to
the
remote
area
s
fledgling
tourism
industry
the
legal
action
also
warns
of
worsening
air
and
water
pollution
crop
damage
and
a
negative
effect
on
wildlife
at
a
nearby
national
park
pt
general
energy
bali
which
runs
the
celukan
bawang
power
plant
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
while
the
company
s
majority
owner
china
huadian
corporation
did
not
answer
calls
building
additional
coal
or
power
capacity
at
celukan
bawang
or
elsewhere
on
bali
is
needed
to
meet
rising
power
demand
jisman
hutajulu
a
senior
electricity
official
at
indonesia
s
energy
ministry
said
by
email
but
the
decision
on
whether
to
opt
for
more
fossil
fuel
capacity
or
renewable
energy
is
for
local
governments
to
make
he
said
adding
that
energy
security
the
environment
and
cost
should
all
be
considered
central
government
policy
on
renewable
energy
has
sought
to
encourage
investment
while
keeping
electricity
prices
affordable
for
consumers
he
noted
indonesia
is
among
the
countries
for
energy
consumption
due
to
a
steadily
increasing
population
economic
development
and
a
rise
in
urbanisation
like
other
asian
nations
jakarta
also
faces
the
challenge
of
boosting
electricity
access
while
meeting
its
pledge
to
cut
emissions
under
the
paris
agreement
indonesia
s
emissions
targets
can
only
be
achieved
by
reducing
its
reliance
on
coal
power
and
ramping
up
investment
in
clean
renewable
energy
projects
several
power
experts
said
indonesia
currently
has
about
gigawatts
of
installed
electricity
capacity
but
to
meet
rising
demand
especially
on
the
main
islands
of
java
bali
and
sumatra
the
country
wants
to
more
than
double
this
over
the
next
decade
with
huge
coal
resources
the
archipelago
relies
heavily
on
power
stations
to
generate
more
than
half
of
its
power
according
to
experts
natural
gas
contributes
about
percent
renewable
energy
percent
and
diesel
the
rest
but
having
committed
to
cutting
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
percent
by
under
the
paris
accord
to
curb
global
warming
jakarta
wants
renewable
projects
to
provide
almost
a
quarter
of
its
power
needs
by
and
nearly
a
third
by
dolf
gielen
director
of
innovation
and
technology
with
the
international
renewable
energy
agency
said
indonesia
was
focused
on
coal
for
power
generation
as
recently
as
a
couple
of
years
ago
but
that
seems
to
be
somewhat
changing
with
more
than
islands
scattered
atop
the
volcanic
pacific
ring
of
fire
power
experts
say
indonesia
has
plenty
of
options
on
renewable
sources
especially
geothermal
the
united
states
is
the
world
s
biggest
geothermal
energy
producer
but
largely
untapped
indonesia
is
second
since
the
massive
sarulla
geothermal
power
plant
on
sumatra
was
expanded
earlier
this
year
is
another
good
renewable
energy
option
for
indonesia
said
yuichiro
yoi
head
of
indonesia
infrastructure
finance
at
the
asian
development
bank
adb
in
manila
north
sumatra
s
asahan
hydroelectric
power
plant
which
began
operating
in
has
helped
indonesia
reduce
its
reliance
on
fossil
fuels
he
added
solar
tidal
and
wind
farms
are
also
suitable
for
many
parts
of
indonesia
experts
said
indonesia
s
first
wind
power
project
the
sidrap
wind
farm
on
the
island
of
sulawesi
began
operating
earlier
this
year
and
is
a
source
of
national
pride
there
are
also
plans
to
build
the
world
s
largest
tidal
power
plant
in
east
flores
media
reports
say
although
a
clean
and
abundant
power
source
indonesia
s
geothermal
resources
are
often
located
on
or
near
protected
forest
areas
which
can
put
off
many
financial
backers
one
solution
may
be
to
exploit
them
on
a
smaller
scale
said
almo
pradana
energy
and
climate
manager
at
the
world
resources
institute
wri
indonesia
similar
to
challenges
facing
other
renewable
projects
indonesia
s
complicated
land
ownership
structures
and
land
acquisition
procedures
can
create
further
risks
said
adb
s
yoi
new
renewables
plants
also
have
to
reach
a
power
supply
agreement
with
the
utility
and
such
discussions
can
lack
transparency
and
lead
to
delays
power
experts
added
in
addition
government
legislation
stipulates
new
renewable
energy
projects
must
provide
electricity
at
a
price
about
percent
cheaper
than
existing
power
plants
in
a
province
as
a
result
renewables
often
can
not
compete
with
coal
the
wri
is
working
with
international
corporations
operating
in
indonesia
that
have
pledged
to
cut
their
emissions
to
try
and
force
the
government
to
change
tack
if
you
don
t
facilitate
a
company
to
switch
to
renewables
they
will
move
to
the
philippines
or
vietnam
where
renewable
energy
regimes
are
more
friendly

to
leave
their
homes
over
the
last
decade
to
make
way
for
the
celukan

plant
s
planned
expansion
surayah
did
reach
an
agreement
to
sell
but
it
collapsed
due

changes
she
said
strengthening
her
resolve

she
will
not
leave
despite
her

she
said
i

the

plant
does
care
about
me
anymore
said
surayah
whose
house
is
more
than
three
hours
drive
from
the
sprawl
of
hotels
and
restaurants
in

the
