his
meeting
with
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
at
a
press
briefing
in
washington

these

russia
s
nord
stream
undersea
gas
pipeline
plans
to
double
the
capacity
of
the
pipeline
to
billion
cubic
meters
per
year
have
riled
both
washington
and
brussels
which
is
trying
to
cut
its
reliance
on
energy
supplies
from
russia
washington
believes
the
pipeline
would
give
russia
which
has
at
times
frozen
deliveries
to
parts
of
europe
over
pricing
disputes
more
power
over
the
region
and
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
has
followed
that
of
barack
obama
in
opposing
the
nord
stream
project
the
planned
volumes
are
more
than
half
of
russian
total
gas
exports
to
europe
which
is
seen
reaching
a
record
high
of
bcm
this
year
the
move
to
expand
the
pipeline
is
also
designed
to
bypass
ukraine
the
main
route
of
russian
gas
exports
to
europe
novak
said
politics
should
not
be
allowed
to
intrude
into
discussion
of
the
nord
stream
project
which
stood
on
its
own
economic
merits
the
implementation
of
such
infrastructure
projects
has
to
be
built
on
the
economic
basis
without
any
political
evaluation
of
this
project
novak
said
after
his
meetings
the
meetings
took
place
while
energy
executives
and
ministers
from
around
the
globe
converged
on
washington
for
the
triennial
world
gas
conference
the
industry
s
biggest
summit
the
congress
has
imposed
economic
sanctions
in
recent
months
against
russia
that
among
other
things
seek
to
prevent
companies
from
participating
in
russian
pipeline
projects
or
oil
and
gas
development
efforts
the
sanctions
were
designed
to
punish
russia
for
its
annexation
of
crimea
from
ukraine
and
for
meddling
in
the
presidential
election
moscow
denies
it
interfered
in
the
election
russia
depends
heavily
on
pipeline
networks
to
get
its
energy
production
to
european
markets
and
is
also
keen
to
develop
energy
reserves
in
its
arctic
novak
has
said
in
the
past
that
the
united
states
should
not
be
permitted
to
impose
such
sanctions
without
a
vote
of
the
united
nations
security
council
of
which
russia
is
a
permanent
member
the
united
states
has
been
urging
increased
supply
from
the
world
s
biggest
producers
including
opec
members
to
help
stem
an
increase
in
oil
prices
that
threatens
economic
growth
it
is
also
renewing
sanctions
against
iran
after
abandoning
a
global
deal
meant
to
stem
its
nuclear
ambitions
and
urging
consumers
of
its
oil
to
stop
their
imports
completely
another
factor
pushing
up
oil
prices
perry
told
reporters
on
monday
before
meeting
with
novak
that
he
was
amenable
to
having
conversations
to
creating
a
relationship
with
russia
he
had
invited
me
to
actually
to
come
visit
some
of
the
things
that
they
are
doing
in
the
arctic
perry
said
i
think
we
ve
got
our
issues
with
russia
but
i
m
one
of
those
that
believe
you
need
to
be
having
conversations
with
folks
and
finding
places
that
we
can
work
