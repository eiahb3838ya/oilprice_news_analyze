u.n. aviation agency approves standards to kickstart emissions deal
montreal
reuters
the
united
nations
aviation
agency
on
wednesday
approved
new
standards
needed
to
implement
a
global
agreement
that
seeks
to
limit
emissions
from
international
flights
an
aviation
industry
group
said
starting
most
airlines
flying
international
routes
will
begin
monitoring
their
fuel
and
carbon
emissions
as
part
of
the
landmark
agreement
brokered
two
years
ago
by
the
international
civil
aviation
organization
icao
airlines
had
called
on
icao
to
approve
the
standards
which
they
need
to
prepare
for
the
agreement
that
officially
goes
into
effect
in
this
now
allows
governments
and
industry
to
make
final
preparations
for
implementation
before
the
emissions
monitoring
and
reporting
obligations
commence
in
january
michael
gill
executive
director
of
the
air
transport
action
group
atag
said
in
a
statement
the
icao
deal
requires
airlines
to
limit
their
emissions
or
offset
them
by
buying
carbon
credits
from
designated
environmental
projects
around
the
world
the
new
standards
approved
by
a
majority
of
icao
s
governing
council
including
the
united
states
give
governments
a
technical
guide
on
how
to
compile
airlines
emissions
and
how
much
the
carriers
will
need
to
offset
this
is
a
very
significant
step
but
there
are
still
important
details
needed
to
be
filled
in
annie
petsonk
international
counsel
for
the
environmental
defense
fund
said
in
a
telephone
interview
icao
has
yet
to
finalize
the
specific
criteria
for
fuels
allowed
under
the
agreement
she
said
in
principle
fossil
fuels
can
qualify
but
they
will
have
to
meet
the
agreement
s
standards
complying
with
the
agreement
is
estimated
to
cost
airlines
less
than
percent
of
industry
revenue
the
deal
is
voluntary
for
the
first
five
years
and
becomes
mandatory
from
for
the
world
s
largest
emitters
airlines
have
supported
a
global
agreement
in
favor
of
a
potentially
more
costly
patchwork
of
national
and
regional
deals

spokesman
