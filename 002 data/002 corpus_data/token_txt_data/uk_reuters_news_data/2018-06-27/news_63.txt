libya
s
oil
ports
of
hariga
and
zueitina
in
eastern
libya
appeared
to
be
working
normally
on
tuesday
after
forces
said
they
had
handed
control
of
the
terminals
to
a
parallel
national
oil
corporation
noc
in
benghazi
sources
said
libya
politically
divided
since
the
uprising
that
toppled
leader
muammar
gaddafi
has
two
rival
versions
of
the
noc
the
internationally
recognised
noc
based
tripoli
in
the
west
and
the
alternative
noc
in
the
eastern
city
of
benghazi
the
ports
are
vital
to
controlling
libya
s
crude
exports
the
north
african
nation
s
main
source
of
revenue
although
shifting
who
controls
the
terminals
also
creates
uncertainty
for
international
buyers
of
libyan
oil
deterring
business
the
announcement
for
transferring
operations
of
eastern
ports
to
noc
in
benghazi
follows
military
action
by
the
eastern
libyan
national
army
lna
under
the
command
of
khalifa
haftar
to
retake
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
ports
which
are
also
in
the
east
and
remain
closed
those
two
closures
have
disrupted
oil
flows
amounting
to
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
which
has
meant
almost
cutting
in
half
libya
s
total
output
that
had
been
running
at
about
million
bpd
earlier
this
year
but
sources
contacted
by
reuters
on
tuesday
indicated
that
hariga
and
zueitina
port
operations
were
continuing
a
shipping
source
said
the
atlantic
explorer
tanker
left
hariga
fully
loaded
on
tuesday
morning
while
an
oil
source
said
the
vessel
had
been
chartered
by
the
noc
in
tripoli
in
zueitina
an
oil
official
said
the
situation
was
normal
with
two
tankers
at
the
terminal
with
the
first
loading
barrels
of
oil
and
the
second
due
to
load
one
million
barrels
haftar
earlier
signed
an
order
handing
all
ports
liberated
by
eastern
forces
to
the
benghazi
noc
which
is
aligned
to
the
eastern
government
which
rejects
the
internationally
recognised
government
of
national
accord
gna
in
tripoli
alongside
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
a
spokesman
for
the
eastern
lna
forces
said
the
order
included
zueitina
and
hariga
combined
exports
from
the
five
ports
now
under
eastern
control
es
sider
ras
lanuf
hariga
zueitina
and
brega
were
about
barrels
per
day
on
june
compared
with
bpd
for
the
full
month
may
according
to
oil
analytics
firm
vortexa
eastern
based
factions
have
repeatedly
tried
and
failed
to
export
oil
independently
unable
to
circumvent
security
council
sanctions
that
recognise
the
tripoli
noc
as
the
sole
legitimate
producer
and
seller
of
libya
s
oil
the
tripoli
government
said
the
decision
by
the
eastern
based
lna
forces
would
deepen
divisions
in
libya
which
has
been
split
between
the
loose
military
and
political
factions
in
the
two
sides
of
the
country
since
such
actions
increase
tension
and
anger
and
do
not
serve
the
path
of
consensus
or
lead
in
any
way
towards
reconciliation
but
establish
disunity
and
engrain
division
the
gna
said
in
its
statement
the
gna
also
appealed
to
the
security
council
and
sanctions
committee
to
prevent
all
illegal
sales
operations
that
could
happen
due
to
these
actions
the
internationally
recognised
noc
in
tripoli
has
also
condemned
the
lna
s
move
as
illegal
saying
it
would
use
all
options
available
to
legally
pursue
any
companies
that
tried
to
buy
oil
from
parallel
institutions
analysts
say
haftar
s
decision
to
shift
control
of
the
ports
could
be
aimed
at
leveraging
more
public
money
from
tripoli
where
oil
revenues
are
processed
by
a
central
bank
governor
whom
eastern
factions
have
tried
to
dislodge
gna
deputy
prime
minister
ahmed
maiteeg
told
reporters
in
tripoli
that
the
noc
should
be
protected
from
politics
this
noc
does
not
deal
with
funds
it
manages
the
oil
sector
and
operates
production
and
it
succeeded
recently
in
raising
production
to
an
excellent
level
and
standard
