in
may
paul
brough
had
just
assumed
the
chairmanship
of
noble
group
and
immediately
faced
a
room
full
of
angry
bankers
demanding
their
money
back
from
the
struggling
commodity
trader
mustering
all
his
years
of
experience
as
a
restructuring
specialist
brough
needed
their
support
to
keep
the
credit
lines
open
that
underpinned
the
operations
of
what
had
once
been
asia
s
biggest
commodity
trading
house
at
the
meeting
in
amsterdam
in
late
may
banks
were
shocked
by
a
recently
reported
quarterly
loss
and
were
in
no
mood
to
keep
supporting
the
company
the
atmosphere
in
the
room
was
highly
charged
brough
told
reuters
in
an
interview
last
week
a
number
of
them
were
already
taking
the
decision
that
they
wanted
to
exit
the
relationship
said
brough
a
former
senior
regional
partner
at
kpmg
in
hong
kong
who
helped
wind
up
the
asian
business
of
lehman
brothers
the
following
week
s
meeting
with
banks
did
not
go
much
better
with
brough
saying
the
banks
made
it
very
clear
that
they
wanted
their
secure
debt
repaid
very
very
however
brough
who
managed
china
s
after
its
billion
collapse
in
convinced
the
banks
to
give
noble
a
debt
reprieve
to
sell
its
assets
in
the
united
states
from
there
brough
who
took
over
from
company
founder
richard
elman
brought
noble
back
from
among
the
biggest
corporate
experiences
in
asia
the
company
last
week
secured
shareholder
support
for
a
billion
debt
restructuring
in
the
months
between
brough
s
appointment
and
last
week
s
deal
noble
dramatically
downsized
and
reported
a
billion
loss
for
including
a
billion
valuation
adjustment
of
its
controversial
derivatives
contracts
by
the
time
brough
became
chairman
noble
had
fended
off
two
years
of
accusations
by
iceberg
research
that
it
had
inflated
its
assets
noble
which
has
stood
by
its
accounts
later
revealed
iceberg
to
be
led
by
credit
analyst
arnaud
vagner
when
brough
took
charge
noble
had
lost
percent
or
nearly
billion
in
market
value
since
iceberg
issued
its
first
report
in
february
brough
reckons
he
travelled
miles
negotiating
with
hundreds
of
creditors
and
shareholders
from
hong
kong
and
singapore
to
new
york
london
and
amsterdam
noble
then
hired
investment
bank
moelis
company
and
lawyers
kirkland
ellis
specialists
in
debt
restructurings
the
first
sign
of
a
possible
wholesale
restructure
pjt
partners
and
comprador
ltd
joined
as
financial
advisors
as
brough
unveiled
a
strategic
review
of
noble
he
brought
together
seven
of
its
core
trade
finance
banks
at
the
amsterdam
meeting
those
banks
included
mufg
bank
ing
bank
and
rabobank
mufg
and
ing
declined
to
comment
while
rabobank
said
it
does
not
comment
on
individual
clients
as
a
policy
it
was
really
one
of
those
meetings
that
served
as
a
meeting
where
everybody
was
put
on
alert
said
a
person
who
participated
in
the
talks
noble
s
rescue
is
viewed
as
one
of
the
most
complex
debt
restructurings
due
to
its
global
trading
business
and
the
mix
of
creditors
from
banks
to
different
strata
of
bondholders
and
shareholders
the
dual
needs
of
keeping
noble
adequately
capitalised
with
trade
finance
at
a
time
when
bankers
were
very
nervous
about
relationships
and
when
customers
are
also
very
nervous
meant
that
it
was
very
very
challenging
said
neil
mcdonald
a
partner
at
kirkland
ellis
when
noble
won
an
extension
for
its
credit
facilities
in
june
its
shares
surged
percent
but
bond
prices
slid
after
it
skipped
an
interest
payment
we
had
to
call
banks
morning
noon
and
night
to
make
sure
they
were
comfortable
with
the
restructuring
said
one
advisor
for
brough
those
summer
months
were
the
lowest
point
in
the
salvage
operation
with
banks
making
aggressive
requests
and
there
were
times
noble
could
have
run
out
of
cash
we
found
ourselves
having
to
increase
the
margin
that
we
were
giving
banks
for
our
trade
finance
facilities
and
for
our
brokerage
facilities
he
said
noble
agreed
to
sell
its
gas
and
power
business
to
mercuria
for
million
last
july
a
deal
that
also
increased
its
trade
finance
access
then
in
october
it
announced
the
sale
of
its
most
business
oil
trading
to
vitol
for
billion
the
first
glimmer
of
hope
was
when
we
announced
the
sale
of
the
oil
business
said
brough
who
will
step
down
after
the
restructured
company
focusing
on
coal
and
freight
trading
in
asia
kicks
off
later
this
year
in
november
noble
formally
announced
the
debt
restructure
and
then
agreed
to
a
deal
to
give
creditors
percent
of
the
new
company
equity
resistance
from
big
shareholders
such
as
elman
and
goldilocks
investment
co
an
abu
fund
put
it
at
risk
but
in
march
noble
s
creditors
agreed
to
give
existing
shareholders
a
percent
equity
share
up
from
a
previous
percent
with
an
ultimatum
back
the
proposal
or
face
insolvency
however
iceberg
s
vagner
says
the
new
noble
will
still
be
most
importantly
interest
skyrockets
so
it
will
incur
almost
the
same
interest
costs
he
told
reuters
by
email
noble
will
also
gain
million
in
trade
financing
and
hedging
facilities
from
ing
and
deutsche
bank
the
last
two
banks
supporting
the
company
down
from
banks
five
years
ago
