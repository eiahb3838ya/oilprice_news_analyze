reuters
energy
industry
associations
called
on
the
european
council
on
tuesday
to
extend
an
exemption
from
the
eu
s
tax
directive
for
power
gas
and
carbon
emission
transactions
to
protect
the
markets
from
fraud
almost
a
decade
ago
the
eu
s
emissions
trading
system
suffered
from
tax
vat
fraud
where
companies
bought
carbon
permits
in
one
country
without
paying
vat
and
then
sold
in
another
adding
tax
to
the
price
but
pocketing
that
difference
for
themselves
the
scam
resulted
in
billions
of
euros
being
defrauded
from
european
coffers
to
combat
the
issue
the
eu
introduced
an
exemption
from
its
vat
directive
for
electricity
gas
and
emissions
trading
transactions
which
will
expire
on
this
year
the
exemption
enables
member
states
to
apply
the
domestic
reverse
charge
mechanism
to
these
goods
and
services
which
ensures
the
seller
does
not
have
to
pay
vat
shifting
the
liability
to
the
buyer
eighteen
industry
associations
including
eurelectric
eurogas
and
the
international
emissions
trading
association
said
vat
fraud
remained
a
persistent
threat
to
the
integrity
and
operation
of
electricity
gas
and
carbon
markets
in
europe
it
has
been
proposed
that
the
exemption
should
continue
until
june
but
industry
associations
said
it
should
be
extended
until
at
least
