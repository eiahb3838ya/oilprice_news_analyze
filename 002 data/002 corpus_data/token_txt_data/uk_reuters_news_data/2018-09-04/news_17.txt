a
rebound
in
chinese
shares
and
a
rally
in
italian
bonds
failed
to
keep
europe
s
spirits
up
on
tuesday
as
a
renewed
burst
of
dollar
strength
and
news
south
africa
had
slumped
into
recession
ramped
up
the
pressure
on
emerging
markets
again
the
sight
of
european
shares
at
a
low
a
percent
thumping
for
south
africa
s
rand
and
fragile
facebook
shares
meant
wall
street
was
facing
a
choppy
restart
after
a
long
holiday
weekend
india
s
rupee
and
indonesia
s
rupiah
had
both
slumped
to
new
lows
overnight
in
asia
too
and
the
turkish
lira
mexican
peso
and
russian
rouble
were
all
deep
in
the
red
again
to
complete
a
turbulent
em
picture
major
fx
pairs
such
as
the
euro
and
yen
were
knocked
back
too
the
euro
fell
percent
to
a
low
at
while
the
yen
dropped
to
per
dollar
having
strengthened
during
asian
trading
the
general
sentiment
is
that
the
dollar
has
not
done
too
badly
out
of
the
trade
war
concerns
with
concerns
the
might
signal
a
fresh
escalation
in
the
trade
conflict
said
kenneth
broux
an
fx
strategist
at
societe
generale
in
london
the
public
comment
period
on
a
proposal
for
new
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
is
set
to
end
on
thursday
after
which
president
donald
trump
can
follow
through
on
plans
to
impose
levies
on
billion
more
of
chinese
imports
though
it
is
unclear
how
quickly
that
will
happen
what
is
sure
though
is
that
the
concerns
are
starting
to
take
their
toll
manufacturing
surveys
published
on
monday
showed
mounting
stress
on
factories
across
europe
and
asia
as
the
outlook
for
global
trade
dims
emerging
market
currencies
are
coming
in
for
special
punishment
the
latest
drop
in
turkey
s
lira
took
it
back
past
per
dollar
and
all
eyes
were
on
how
argentina
s
peso
would
fare
during
the
latin
american
session
after
it
ended
more
than
percent
weaker
on
monday
that
came
despite
president
mauricio
macri
announcing
new
taxes
on
exports
and
steep
cuts
to
government
spending
in
what
he
termed
emergency
measures
to
balance
next
year
s
budget
as
part
of
a
billion
imf
support
package
we
are
just
waiting
for
something
to
turn
the
em
emerging
market
sentiment
because
the
valuations
look
really
attractive
but
it
s
just
a
slow
meltdown
at
the
moment
said
standard

aberdeen
em
portfolio
manager
viktor
szabo
he
pointed
out
that
south
africa
s
rand
had
now
wiped
out
all
the
gains
it
made
after
cyril
ramaphosa
replaced
jacob
zuma
as
the
country
s
president
in
february
european
shares
were
down
almost
percent
ahead
of
the
opening
reversing
a
positive
start
financials
held
up
a
bit
better
supported
by
strength
among
some
italian
banks
following
soothing
comments
from
italian
ministers
on
forthcoming
budget
proposals
sources
told
reuters
that
rome
s
economy
minister
giovanni
tria
was
pushing
the
governing
coalition
to
keep
next
year
s
budget
deficit
below
percent
of
output
deputy
prime
minister
matteo
salvini
had
said
on
monday
that
it
would
not
breach
the
european
union
s
percent
limit
italian

also
rallied
with

flirting
with
their
biggest
daily
drop
in
almost
three
months
at
percent
yields
move
inversely
to
a

s
price
the
bond
yield
spread
also
narrowed
i
would
say
the
overall
price
action
is
quite
encouraging
and
salvini
s
comments
yesterday
gave
the
market
another
push
commerzbank
rates
strategist
christoph
rieger
said
elsewhere
it
was
a
very
different
story
emerging
market
debt
presented
an
ugly
picture
amid
the
widespread
gloom
while
expectations
that
the
federal
reserve
will
raise
interest
rates
again
this
month
pushed
up
the
