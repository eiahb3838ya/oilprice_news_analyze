fear
of
contagion
from
the
economic
woes
in
argentina
and
turkey
have
driven
investors
away
from
emerging
markets
and
the
rupiah
has
become
the

warjiyo
said
the
rupiah
should
come
under
less
pressure
next

as
the
federal

interest
rates
just
three
times
next
year

authorities
were
examining
the
reasons
behind
the
rupiah
s
drop
saying
there
had
been
speculative
trading
and
a
technical
problem
with
quotations
there
were
things
that
pushed
the
depreciation
further
that
we
think
makes
it
illogical
we
re
looking
to
find
out
why
beside
argentina

them
unable
to

nasution
said
i
don
t
know
what
happened
but
immediately
it
was
resolved
he
said
my
point
is
there
are
technical
problems

raised

rates
by
basis
points

in
intervention
defending
the
rupiah

an
attempt
to
anticipate
future
dollar
requirements

oil
and
gas
projects
would
be
delayed

restructured
but
noted
that
refinery
projects

also
push
