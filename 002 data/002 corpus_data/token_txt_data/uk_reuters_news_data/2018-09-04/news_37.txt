china
appears
set
to
once
again
boost
its
purchases
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
for
the
northern
winter
but
unlike
last
year
s
rush
this
time
the
process
is
likely
to
be
more
organised
and
stable
in
recent
weeks
there
have
been
several
indicators
that
china
is
planning
on
increasing
the
use
of
natural
gas
in
winter
heating
replacing
boilers
that
use
more
polluting
coal
curbing
winter
air
pollution
has
been
a
major
aim
of
the
authorities
in
beijing
but
they
were
stung
by
criticism
last
year
that
the
switch
to
natural
gas
was
made
too
quickly
and
the
resulting
shortages
left
some
people
without
adequate
heating
a
sign
that
beijing
is
putting
more
effort
into
ensuring
sufficient
natural
gas
supplies
came
last
week
when
of
finance
liu
wei
was
quoted
by
the
communist
party
newspaper
as
saying
that
gas
supply
agreements
must
be
in
place
when
converting
boilers
to
the
cleaner
fuel
these
comments
were
followed
by
an
announcement
by
oil
and
gas
major
sinopec
that
it
is
putting
in
place
a
range
of
measures
to
boost
winter
natural
gas
supplies
including
increasing
purchases
of
spot
lng
cargoes
and
boosting
distribution
it
s
often
a
challenge
with
china
to
work
out
exactly
how
official
pronouncements
will
translate
into
real
world
action
but
in
all
likelihood
china
is
going
to
increase
lng
imports
in
coming
months
this
will
come
on
top
of
an
already
strong
year
so
far
with
both
official
customs
data
and
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
showing
impressive
gains
china
imported
about
million
tonnes
of
lng
in
august
the
highest
since
january
according
to
the
shipping
data
imports
for
the
first
eight
months
totalled
million
tonnes
up
percent
from
the
same
period
last
year
customs
data
for
the
january
to
july
period
shows
imports
of
about
million
tonnes
up
percent
from
the
same
period
in
in
addition
to
the
surge
in
import
volumes
the
data
show
that
china
s
lng
purchases
haven
t
shown
as
much
of
the
seasonal
swings
of
past
years
with
a
strong
winter
peak
followed
by
lulls
in
spring
and
summer
before
picking
up
in
autumn
in
the
winter
imports
in
december
and
january
were
some
percent
higher
than
those
in
july
however
imports
in
july
this
year
were
only
percent
below
the
previous
winter
peak
months
of
december
and
january
indicating
that
lng
demand
has
remained
robust
throughout
the
year
so
far
there
was
a
summer
in
china
which
boosted
electricity
demand
for
but
this
had
more
of
an
impact
on
coal
demand
given
limited
power
generation
from
natural
gas
it
seems
that
china
has
not
only
been
increasing
its
consumption
of
natural
gas
but
has
also
been
building
up
storage
capacity
in
order
to
increase
availability
during
the
winter
peak
what
appears
to
be
happening
is
that
china
s
lng
demand
is
becoming
more
which
should
mitigate
swings
in
spot
pricing
in
asia
indeed
this
has
already
occurred
to
some
extent
with
spot
prices
showing
a
milder
decline
to
the
low
point
from
the
prior
winter
s
peak
than
in
previous
years
the
drop
from
the
winter
peak
in
january
to
the
low
in
march
was
percent
compared
to
percent
last
year
and
percent
the
year
before
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
spot
lng
enjoyed
a
surprise
summer
peak
but
this
is
more
likely
related
to
the
unusually
hot
northern
summer
prices
have
been
rising
since
late
july
and
last
week
reached
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
this
is
coincidentally
the
peak
price
from
the
previous
winter
which
was
reached
in
this
is
a
sign
that
spot
lng
prices
are
likely
to
rise
further
in
coming
weeks
but
may
peak
earlier
than
usual
assuming
winter
temperatures
fall
within
the
normal
ranges
