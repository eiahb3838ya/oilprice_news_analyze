bangkok
reuters
governments
are
unprepared
for
a
crucial
climate
change
meeting
in
poland
later
this
year
aimed
at
ensuring
the
full
implementation
of
the
paris
agreement
fiji
prime
minister
josaia
voreqe
bainimarama
said
on
tuesday
at
the
opening
of
climate
talks
in
bangkok
the
talks
in
the
thai
capital
come
ahead
of
a
gathering
in
katowice
poland
in
december
when
government
ministers
will
meet
to
agree
rules
for
the
paris
climate
accord
president
donald
trump
who
in
the
past
has
described
climate
change
as
a
hoax
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
the
paris
agreement
in
saying
it
favoured
other
countries
and
was
disadvantageous
to
the
united
states
the
paris
agreement
set
a
sweeping
goal
of
ending
the
fossil
fuel
era
this
century
but
the
text
was
vague
on
details
bainimarama
who
is
also
president
of
the
or
annual
conference
of
the
parties
to
the
united
nations
framework
convention
on
climate
change
said
that
without
guidelines
countries
risk
chaos
at
katowice
and
the
possibility
of
yet
another
delay
in
the
urgent
work
of
combating
climate
in
three
months
time
we
will
be
in
katowice
and
frankly
we
are
not
ready
i
don
t
think
that
statement
should
surprise
anyone
in
this
room
he
said
in
an
opening
statement
after
failing
to
make
enough
progress
in
bonn
in
may
the
bangkok
summit
is
seen
as
a
last
shot
before
katowice
this
is
not
just
an
additional
session
it
is
an
urgent
session
bainimarama
said
would
any
of
us
like
to
return
to
our
people
and
tell
them
that
we
had
the
chance
to
do
something
truly
great
and
truly
necessary
for
the
world
we
will
pass
to
our
children
but
that
we
lacked
the
will
to
get
it
done
he
asked
around
our
world
the
affects
of
climate
change
are
becoming
more
evident
and
more
severe
no
country
or
region
is
spared
and
the
effects
in
one
region
are
felt
in
others
he
added
he
urged
delegates
to
come
up
with
clear
guidelines
on
sunday
patricia
espinosa
executive
secretary
of
the
united
nations
framework
convention
on
climate
change
unfccc
told
reuters
governments
are
not
on
track
to
meet
a
goal
of
the
paris
agreement
of
capping
temperatures
well
below

celsius
fahrenheit
before
the
end
of
the
century
espinosa
said
she
hopes
a
draft
text
for
negotiation
on
the
rule
book
of
the
agreement
will
emerge
at
the
end
of
the
bangkok
talks
