reuters
oil
and
natural
gas
producer
chevron
corp
on
friday
reported
that
its
quarterly
profit
doubled
on
record
oil
and
gas
production
sending
its
shares
up
as
much
as
percent
the
results
reflected
strong
gains
in
its
oil
and
gas
production
with
crude
prices
up
percent
during
the
quarter
and
offset
a
drop
in
earnings
from
its
downstream
operations
including
refining
and
chemicals
oil
and
gas
production
rose
percent
over
a
year
earlier
and
the
company
forecast
total
output
for
the
full
year
would
be
up
about
percent
over
its
production
in
the
west
texas
shale
fields
rose
percent
in
the

adding
barrels
per

of
adding

pat
yarrington
the
company
s
finance
chief
told
analysts
on
a
conference
call
chevron
ran
drilling
rigs
in
its
permian
operations
during
the
quarter
and
will
continue
running
the
same
number
this
quarter
yarrington
said
our
approach
right
now
is
to
take
a
bit
of
a
pause
and
to
focus
on
capturing
all
the
efficiencies
that
a
fleet
would
necessitate
she
added
downstream
earnings
and
cash
flow
will
be
hurt
by
higher
planned
maintenance
activity
the
company
said
downstream
profit
fell
percent
in
the
quarter
from
continuing
weakness
in
its
international
refining
operations
pierre
breber
chevron
s
executive
vice
president
of
downstream
and
chemicals
declined
to
comment
on
reports
it
is
in
discussions
to
acquire
a
gulf
coast
refinery
but
he
said
the
company
has
strong
reasons
including
growing
permian
oil
production
to
consider
doing
so
the
company
reported
net
income
of
billion
or
a
share
compared
with
