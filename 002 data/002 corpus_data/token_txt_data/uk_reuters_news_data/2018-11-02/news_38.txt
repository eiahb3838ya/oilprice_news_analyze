reuters summit-southeast asia's renewables held back by policy inaction - irena

reuters
southeast
asia
is
a
potential
hotspot
for
renewable
energy
yet
the
region
has
not
met
expectations
because
it
lacks
policy
frameworks
that
would
encourage
investment
the
international
renewable
energy
agency
irena
told
reuters
renewables
across
the
world
have
typically
been
boosted
by
policies
like
price
subsidies
and
guaranteed
grid
takeoff
in
southeast
asia
though
barring
some
exceptions
such
as
in
thailand
support
for
renewables
has
been
smaller
and
the
region
lags
far
behind
others
in
renewable
output
despite
its
potential
especially
for
solar
geothermal
and
wind
power

top
renewable

one
of
the
factors
holding
back
renewables
is
the
region
s
abundance
of
thermal
coal
of
which
indonesia
is
the
world
s
biggest
exporter
some
of
the
ministers
here
believe
coal
is
one
of
their
cheaper
alternatives
which
to
some
extent
is
due
to
the
abundance
of
proven
coal
resources
in
southeast
asia
irena
s
director
general
adnan
amin
told
the
reuters
commodity
summit
interview
series
this
week
glencore
the
world
s
biggest
thermal
coal
exporting
company
said
on
thursday
that
southeast
asia
will
drive
future
economic
growth
and
demand
for
the
miner
said
coal
will
account
for
percent
of
energy
growth
in
southeast
asia
by
despite
the
emergence
of
renewables

global
renewable
capacity
excluding

has
soared
from
under
megawatts
mw
in
to
more
than
million
mw
in
according
to
irena
data
only
a
tiny
portion
of
that
has
come
in
southeast
asia
europe
and
north
america
were
the
first
regions
to
seriously
boost
renewable
energy
and
today
china
is
the
leader
in
the
sector
with
india
catching
up
now
there
are
also
efforts
underway
in
southeast
asia
the
association
of
southeast
asian
nations
asean
plans
to
generate
percent
of
its
primary
energy
needs
from
renewables
by
up
from
just
over
percent
now
to
help
achieve
that
asean
and
irena
signed
an
agreement
this
week
to
boost
renewable
investment
and
deployment
i
think
the
adoption
of
the
percent
target
is
a
very
good
step
but
that
needs
to
be
translated
now
into
policy
actions
said
amin
over
the
next
decade
a
total
of
billion
will
have
to
be
invested
for
southeast
asia
to
reach
its
targets
a
increase
on
the
annual
investments
we
re
seeing
today
amin
said
speaking
to
reuters
while
attending
singapore
s
international
energy
week
siew
amin
said
renewable
investment
including
in
southeast
asia
would
receive
a
boost
from
dramatic
reductions
in
the
cost
of
solar
panel
prices
have
crashed
to
under
cents
per
watt
of
electricity
from
around
per
watt
in
as
technology
and
manufacturing
efficiency
have
improved
graphic
solar
panel
costs
vs
capacity
solar
is
very
dynamic
right
now
and
is
going
to
take
the
largest
share
of
investments
we
re
seeing
over
the
next
decade
another
percent
decrease
in
costs
which
will
bring
electricity
cost
very
close
to
zero
amin
said
at
the
same
time
amin
said
capital
markets
were
starting
to
price
carbon
risks
raising
the
cost
of
fossil
fuels
financial
institutions
have
started
to
bail
out
from
financing
coal
so
cost
of
investments
in
coal
will
rise
while
cost
of
investments
in
renewables
are
decreasing
amin
said
the
latest
major
bank
to
pull
out
of
coal
financing
was
britain
s
standard
chartered
in
september
renewable
investments
have
soared
over
the
past
decade
though
reaching
almost
trillion
since
irena
said
amin
said
solar
would
also
start
to
compete
with
natural
gas
an
industry
that
has
so
far
seen
itself
as
complementary
to
intermittent
renewables
we
see
the
momentum
on
renewables
going
so
fast
that
they
ve
become
competitive
with
gas
power
generation
increasingly
as
people
do
the
math
about
investments
the
renewables
will
start
to
play
a
bigger
