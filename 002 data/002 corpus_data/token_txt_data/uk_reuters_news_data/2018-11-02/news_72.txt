asian
shares
jumped
on
friday
after
a
phone
call
between
the
and
chinese
presidents
raised
hopes
of
a
thaw
in
trade
tensions
but
gains
were
checked
by
signs
of
slowing
global
growth
and
a
warning
from
tech
giant
apple
inc
on
holiday
sales
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
touched
a
high
and
was
last
up
percent
adding
to
the
previous

s
strong
gains
but
that
came
after
a
sharp
percent
dive
in
october
its
worst
month
since
august
chinese
gained
percent
and
china
s
board
added
percent
after

xi
jinping
promised
more
support
for
private
firms
japan
s
nikkei
stock
index
was
percent
higher
the
cheerier
mood
in
asian
trade
followed
a
rise
in
shares
overnight
with
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
and
the
s
p
each
gaining
percent
while
the
nasdaq
composite
rallied
percent
a
combination
of
following
steep
losses
in
equities
last
month
and
some
strong
corporate
earnings
have
helped
power
wall
street
s
bounce
after
the
bell
though
shares
of
apple
tumbled
about
percent
after
it
said
sales
for
the
crucial
holiday
quarter
could
miss
wall
street
expectations
due
to
weakness
in
emerging
markets
and
foreign
exchange
costs
apple
suppliers
in
asia
largely
shrugged
off
the
news
as
investors
hoped
some
progress
was
being
made
on
trade
hon
hai
precision
industry
co
gained
percent
and
taiwan
semiconductor
manufacturing
co
added

global
investors
lapped
up
news
that
the

of
the

s
two
largest
economies
may
be
ready

president
donald
trump
said
trade
discussions
with
china
were
moving
along
nicely
and
his

hopes
of
expanding
trade
cooperation
trump

quoted
as
saying
china
was
not
ready
to
make
a
deal
yet
and
he
would
impose
more
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
unless
he
and
xi
had
productive
talks
while
we
are
still
cautious
over
a
full
resolution
of
recent
tensions
in
the
medium
term
resumption
of
dialogue
between
washington
and
beijing
would
be
good
enough
to
investors
for
now
hence
the
next
four
weeks
between
the

the
meeting

argentina
on
