said
on

it
regards
the
market
as
its
best
opportunity
for
consolidation
chief

walsh
told

he
expected

in
europe
and
that
iag
had
the
financial
headroom
needed
to
pursue
acquisitions
when
we
talk
about
consolidation
it
norwegian
is
an
opportunity
particularly
if
you
look
at
the
network
and
further
consolidation
in
that
network
it
s
probably
the
best
opportunity
for
us
walsh
said
walsh
said
he
had
nothing
new
to
report
on
norwegian
in
which
iag
owns
a
percent
stake
and
which
has
rejected
two
approaches
by
the
owner
of
ba
iberia
aer
lingus
and
vueling
iag
said
on
friday
most
of
its
financial
goals
for
were
the
same
as
those
made
in
a
plan
last
year
the
group
said
it
was
sticking
to
a
target
to
post
an
operating
profit
margin
of
between
and
percent
despite
a
sharp
rise
in
oil
prices
as
it
continues
to
outperform
european
rivals
lufthansa
and
air
shares
in
iag
were
flat
at
pence
at
gmt
paring
early
gains
of
percent
liberum
analyst
gerald
khoo
said
it
was
positive
that
the
targets
have
gone
up
despite
a
tougher
fuel
cost
environment
but
a
risk
of
greater
scepticism
on
delivery
as
a
jet
fuel
has
risen
by
more
than
percent
from
months
ago
the
international
air
transport
association
iata
says
iag
said
average
earnings
per
share
would
grow
more
than
percent
per
year
from
to
in
line
with
the
forecast
it
made
last
year
it
also
raised
its
outlook
for
core
annual
earnings
ebitar
to
an
average
forecast
of
around
billion
euros
billion
from
billion
euros
those
forecasts
came
after
it
said
last
week
that
for
annual
profit
would
increase
by
million
euros
that
compared
to
lufthansa
s
outlook
for
adjusted
earnings
ebit
this
year
to
show
a
slight
fall
from
s
record
air
has
spent
the
year
struggling
with
costly
strikes
before
finally
agreeing
a
pay
deal
with
unions
in
october
it
has
faced
competition
from
carriers
like
ryanair
and
easyjet
but
has
been
unable
to
overhaul
costs
and
services
as
iag
and
lufthansa
have
in
its
outlook
iag
raised
its
forecast
for
capital
expenditure
to
billion
euros
a
year
from
billion
and
said
it
would
grow
available
seat
kilometres
a
measure
of
capacity
by
percent
a
year
up
from
percent
previously
walsh
said
that
capacity
growth
would
deliver
we

not
putting

we
think
there

an
opportunity
