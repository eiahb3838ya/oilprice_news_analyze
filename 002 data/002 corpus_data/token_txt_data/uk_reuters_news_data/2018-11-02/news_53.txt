insight-trump's latest tariffs undercut his first trade salvo in solar
los
angeles
reuters
in
january
president
donald
trump
fired
the
opening
shot
of
his
trade
war
slapping
tariffs
on
solar
panel
imports
to
boost
manufacturing
of
a
product
long
dominated
by
cheap
foreign
competition
but
other
duties
his
administration
has
imposed
since
then
are
making
the
solar
panel
components
more
expensive
dampening
the
domestic
panel
manufacturing
sector
s
initial
hopes
for
expansion
the
conflicting
impacts
of
his
tariffs
illustrate
the
pitfalls
the
administration
faces
in
using
broad
protections
for
economic
development
because
tariffs
meant
to
help
one
industry
often
undermine
those
shielding
another
other
examples
include
a
levy
on
imported
washing
machines
to
help
domestic
manufacturers
such
as
whirlpool
the
effect
of
which
has
since
been
undercut
by
separate
tariffs
on
the
imported
steel
and
aluminium
used
to
make
them
for
the
solar
industry
the
impact
of
trump
s
tariffs
for
companies
and
jobs
gets
even
more
complex
the
united
states
currently
accounts
for
just
a
fraction
of
the
global
panel
manufacturing
industry
a
key
reason
why
trump
moved
to
protect
the
sector
while
the
january
tariff
on
panels
initially
boosted
the
manufacturing
outlook
it
dented
the
prospects
for
the
panel
installation
business
by
making
panels
more
expensive
for
consumers
now
solar
manufacturers
including
four
that
said
they
would
expand
production
after
trump
s
january
announcement
are
also
taking
a
hit
this
time
from
newer
tariffs
covering
a
range
of
components
used
in
panel
production
two
companies
with
operations
china
s
jinko
solar
and
silicon
valley
startup
solaria
told
reuters
they
have
scaled
back
initial
growth
plans
as
a
result
the
impacts
are
generally
very
very
negative
suvi
sharma
the
chief
executive
of
solaria
told
reuters
jinko
slashed
a
planned
million
investment
at
a
manufacturing
facility
in
florida
to
just
million
costing
the
city
of
jacksonville
some
prospective
jobs
according
to
public
disclosures
filed
by
the
city
council
solaria
abandoned
its
hopes
of
boosting
production
this
year
at
its
plant
in
fremont
california
and
adding
jobs
finished
solar
panels
require
scores
of
components
ranging
from
aluminium
framing
to
transformers
solar
glass
and
power
inverters
trump
imposed
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
early
this
year
and
many
of
the
other
materials
used
in
panels
now
also
face
duties
as
part
of
trump
s
percent
levy
on
about
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
that
went
into
effect
in
september
the
tax
on
those
imports
will
rise
to
percent
on
white
house
spokeswoman
lindsay
walters
said
the
solar
tariffs
were
designed
with
other
duties
in
mind
and
that
domestic
solar
panel
manufacturers
should
consider
buying
their
components
from
places
other
than
china
that
could
be
difficult
because
china
is
the
top
source
of
cheap
components
but
some
panel
manufacturers
say
they
are
already
sourcing
panel
components
from
countries
other
than
china
including
korea
s
lg
which
is
starting
panel
production
in
alabama
next
year
and
canada
s
heliene
which
started
production
in
minnesota
in
october
some
are
also
shifting
production
out
of
china
to
serve
manufacturers
enphase
energy
for
example
said
it
will
start
making
microinverters
for
the
market
in
mexico
its
rival
solaredge
has
said
it
would
move
some
production
to
romania
and
hungary
the
billion
solar
industry
employs
more
than
people
most
of
them
in
installation
and
development
and
only
about
a
fifth
in
manufacturing
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
the
commerce
department
s
senior
renewable
energy
specialist
cora
dickson
acknowledged
at
a
september
solar
industry
trade
show
that
the
tariffs
impacting
components
pose
a
challenge
for
domestic
panel
manufacturers
but
added
they
will
be
lifted
once
the
and
china
come
to
better
terms
on
trade
it
s
not
designed
to
cut
off
trade
from
china
forever
she
said
at
the
solar
power
international
conference
in
anaheim
california
solaria
s
sharma
estimated
that
tariffs
this
year
have
increased
the
company
s
production
costs
by
about
percent
an
amount
equal
to
the
original
solar
panel
import
duty
that
means
that
instead
of
ramping
up
its
fremont
california
factory
to
its
full
mw
of
capacity
as
solaria
had
planned
this
year
it
has
kept
production
constant
at
an
unspecified
level
jinko
has
seen
its
growth
plans
constrained
by
trump
administration
tariffs
on
steel
for
factory
construction
manufacturing
equipment
said
general
manager
nigel
cockroft
certain
parts
for
panel
assembly
are
also
limiting
factors
he
said
the
public
documents
filed
by
jacksonville
s
city
council
in
january
and
march
show
jinko
s
original
million
investment
plan
for
the
jacksonville
facility
would
have
produced
some
jobs
the
million
plan
that
replaced
it
will
create
jinko
declined
to
elaborate
on
the
documents
sunpower
a
major
solar
company
that
bought
a
manufacturing
plant
in
oregon
after
trump
s
initial
panel
import
tariff
is
another
company
feeling
the
pinch
we
are
certainly
concerned
suzanne
leta
the
head
of
global
market
strategy
at
sunpower
said
at
the
solar
power
international
conference
the
new
tariffs
are
discouraging
the
kind
of
manufacturing
expansion
the
original
tariffs
on
imported
panels
were
meant
to
encourage
she
said
leta
did
not
say
specifically
how
the
component
tariffs
might
affect
sunpower
s
domestic
output
and
the
company
declined
further
comment
other
solar
panel
producers
with
operations
contacted
by
reuters
including
korea
s
lg
and
canada
s
heliene
said
they
expected
the
impact
of
the
new
rounds
of
tariffs
to
be
limited
because
of
their
particular
supply
chain
dynamics
another
canadian
firm
silfab
solar
expects
slightly
elevated
costs
at
the
factory
in
bellingham
washington
it
took
over
from
itek
energy
llc
in
october
according
to
spokesman
geoff
atkins
for
first
solar
inc
which
mostly
manufactures
panels
in
asia
but
is
expanding
a
factory
in
ohio
tariffs
pose
a
headwind
for
operations
chief
executive
mark
widmar
said
on
a
conference
call
with
analysts
citing
higher
costs
for
steel
parts
and
aluminium
frames
solar
and
electric
vehicle
maker
tesla
inc
complained
about
the
tariffs
in
a
september
letter
to
the
trade
representative
saying
they
will
hinder
american
innovation
expansion
of
companies
and
the
creation
of
more
american
the
company
declined
to
comment
on
the
specific
impact
of
the
tariffs
on
its
operations
including
its
solar
manufacturing
plant
in
buffalo
new
york
where
it
is
already
facing
technical
challenges
to
increasing
output
the
solar
energy
industry
association
seia
the
solar
industry
s
primary
trade
group
said
it
had
opposed
the
initial
solar
panel
tariff
in
january
to
begin
with
because
it
expected
the
benefit
for
domestic
manufacturing
would
fail
to
compensate
for
damage
to
the
solar
installation
industry
now
the
impact
of
additional
tariffs
on
components
used
in
manufacturing
are
slowing
down
something
we
had
pretty
low
expectations
for
to
begin
