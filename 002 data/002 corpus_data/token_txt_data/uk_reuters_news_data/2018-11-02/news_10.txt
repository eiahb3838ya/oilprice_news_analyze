block
a
trial
in
a
lawsuit
filed
by
young
activists
who
have
accused
the
government
of
ignoring
the
perils
of
climate
change
the
loss
for
the
administration
means
it
now
faces
a
examination
of
climate
change
policy
during

due
to
begin
on
in
eugene
oregon
but
has
since
been
postponed

while
the

as
a
whole
decided
how
to
proceed
the
supreme

s
order
noted
that
the
administration
may
still
have
grounds
to
take
its
arguments
to
the
san
circuit
court
of
appeals
conservative
justices
clarence
thomas
and
neil
gorsuch
indicated
they

no
indication
how
trump
s
new
supreme
court
appointee
conservative
brett
kavanaugh
voted
on
the
issue
in
the
lawsuit
activists
ages
to
said
federal
officials
violated
their
rights
to
due
process
under
the
constitution
by
failing
to
adequately
address
carbon
pollution
such
as
emissions
from
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels
the
lawsuit
was
filed
in
against
former
president
barack
obama
and
government
agencies
in
a
federal
court
in
eugene
oregon
both
the
obama
and
trump
administrations
have
failed
in
efforts
to
have
the
lawsuit
thrown
out
the
administration
has
said
a
courtroom
is
not
the
appropriate
venue
for
a
debate
on
climate
change
policy
this
suit
is
an
attempt
to
redirect
federal
environmental
and
energy
policies
through
the
courts
rather
than
through
the
political
process
by
asserting
a
new
and
unsupported
fundamental
due
process
right
to
certain
climate
conditions
trump
administration
solicitor
general
noel
francisco
said
in
court
papers
francisco
noted
that
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
to
hold
the
government
liable
for
the
cumulative
effects
of
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
every
source
in
the
world
over
lawyers
for
the
young
activists
led
by
julia
olson
of
a
group
called
our
children
s
trust
that
brought
the
lawsuit
have
said
their
clients
have
suffered
irreparable
harm
from
the
effects
of
a
changing
climate
this
is
a
case
about
the
fundamental
rights
of
children
and
whether
the
actions
of
their
government
have
deprived
them
of
their
inalienable
rights
olson
said
in
court
papers
on
july
the
high
court
rejected
an
earlier
application
by
the
trump
administration
calling
it
premature
eugene
federal
judge
ann
aiken
has
repeatedly
allowed
the
case
to
move
forward
to
trial
over
the
objections
of
the
government
the
trial
will
proceed
if
neither
the
high
court
nor
the
circuit
intervene
aiken
said
in
an
ruling
that
although
the
case
raised
questions
about
the
role
of
the
judiciary
delving
into
a
matter
of
policy
those
concerns
were
not
enough
to
warrant
a
dismissal
of
the
entire
case
