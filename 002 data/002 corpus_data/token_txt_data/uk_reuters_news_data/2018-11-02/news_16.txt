dubai

iranians
fear
an
even
more
painful
squeeze
on
living
costs
after
additional
sanctions
take
effect
on
monday
from
businesses
struggling
to
buy
raw
materials
to
the
sick
and
elderly
unable
to
afford
medicines
the
united
states
will
reapply
curbs
to
the
country
s
vital
petroleum
and
banking
sectors
on
monday
in
an
effort
to
rein
in
its
arch
foe
s
nuclear
missile
and
regional
activities
iran
s
clerical
rulers
have
played
down
the
move
but
many
ordinary
iranians
appear
apprehensive
all
the
prices
are
going
higher
every
day
i
can
not
imagine
what
will
happen
after
aban
i
am
scared
i
am
worried
i
am
desperate
said
elementary
school
teacher
pejman
sarafnejad
a
father
of
three
in
tehran
i
can
not
even
buy
rice
to
feed
my
children
or
pay
my
the
daily
struggle
to
make
ends
meet
has
been
getting
harder
for
months
the
economy
was
battered
by
the
reimposition
of
a
first
raft
of
curbs
in
august
after
washington
s
pullout
from
a
nuclear
deal
between
tehran
and
global
powers
in
may
foreign
businesses
of
all
types
ranging
from
oil
companies
trading
houses
to
shipping
have
stopped
doing
business
with
iran
for
fear
of
incurring
penalties
a
tehran
grand
bazaar
grocery
shop
owner
said
i
am
very
nervous
because
already
there
is
shortage
of
some
goods
in
the
market
and
the
rial
has
lost
so
much
value
what
will
happen
after
the
reimposition
of
new
sanctions
iran
s
leadership
says
tehran
will
not
succumb
to
pressure
to
halt
its
missile
programs
or
to
change
its
regional
policy
yet
while
some
iranians
back
their
leaders
defiance
others
are
fearful
that
the
economy
weakened
by
years
of
sanctions
mismanagement
and
corruption
may
collapse
when
the
puts
more
pressure
on
the
world
s
number
crude
exporter
statements
by
government
officials
that
the
sanctions
will
have
no
impact
are
political
slogans
said
lawyer
farhad
alavi
who
focuses
on
trade
regulation
and
sanctions
the
fact
is
that
these
restrictions
significantly
increase
transaction
costs
for
since
the
reimposition
of
the
first
round
of
curbs
in
august
prices
of
bread
cooking
oil
and
other
staples
have
soared
and
the
rial
national
currency
has
fallen
sharply
rice
one
of
the
staples
of
iran
s
diet
has
more
than
tripled
in
price
since
last
year
because
of
the
rial
s
fall
ordinary
iranians
fear
cuts
in
iran
s
oil
sales
could
be
the
ultimate
hammer
blow
to
the
economy
since
energy
exports
are
still
the
country
s
main
source
of
earnings
iranian
leaders
hope
sanctions
waivers
granted
to
eight
buyers
of
iranian
crude
combined
with
rising
oil
prices
will
compensate
for
a
reduction
oil
export
volumes
but
even
without
the
new
measures
due
on
monday
iranian
businessmen
have
been
finding
it
harder
to
cope
some
percent
of
small
factories
businesses
and
workshops
have
already
started
to
shut
down
in
the
past
months
due
to
lack
of
raw
materials
and
hard
currency
according
to
iranian
media
i
had
to
close
my
business
those
european
companies
that
were
racing
to
ink
a
deal
with
me
last
year
now
refuse
to
return
my
calls
said
a
businessman
in
tehran
who
declined
to
be
named
mohammad
reza
sadoughi
says
ordinary
people
will
bear
the
brunt
of
the
sanctions
in
terms
of
medicines
for
the
sick
such
as
cancer
patients
and
food
shortages
and
currency
problems
my
father
has
cancer
and
with
sanctions
the
medicine
that
his
life
depends
on
will
only
be
available
in
the
black
market
for
a
higher
price
said
the
government
employee
in
the
northern
city
of
sari
the
sanctions
permits
trade
in
humanitarian
goods
such
as
food
and
pharmaceuticals
yet
measures
imposed
on
banks
and
trade
restrictions
will
make
life
hard
for
iranian
patients
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
s
the
iranian
people
with
their
aspiration
to
lead
a
good
life
who
are
suffering
due
to
lack
of
good
sense
from
their
own
regime
who
are
not
ready
to
compromise
with
the
world
power
said
businessman
aftab
hasan
a
member
of
the
iranian
business
council
in
dubai
however
analysts
say
that
economic
grievances
are
unlikely
to
revive
unrest
such
as
the
demonstrations
in
december
that
turned
into
rallies
i
don
t
care
about
politics
i
don
t
care
who
is
responsible
for
our
problems
i
don
t
want
a
regime
change
i
just
want
to
live
peacefully
with
my
family
in
my
country

housewife
fariba
shakouri
in

city
of
