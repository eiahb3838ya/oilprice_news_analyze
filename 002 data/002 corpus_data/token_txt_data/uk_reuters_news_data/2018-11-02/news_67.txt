reuters summit-mercuria predicts new wave of consolidation in global oil trading
london
reuters
global
energy
trading
businesses
are
set
for
a
new
wave
of
consolidation
as
rising
interest
rates
and
high
oil
prices
compress
already
thin
profit
margins
said
mercuria
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
oil
traders
the
overall
industry
is
oversized
chief
executive
marco
dunand
told
the
reuters
global
commodities
summit
in
the
trading
world
if
you
look
typically
over
the
last
few
years
what
the
return
on
equity
in
trading
is
it
s
not
so
bad
but
if
you
look
at
profit
compared
to
turnover
it
is
very
small
he
said
the
industry
usually
operates
with
a
net
margin
of
below
percent
and
during
poor
years
closer
to
percent
which
dunand
said
leaves
very
little
room
for
error
the
net
margin
compared
to
turnover
is
probably
one
of
the
lowest
you
can
find
in
markets
we
believe
there
should
be
consolidation
within
the
mercuria
grew
rapidly
in
recent
years
by
buying
trading
books
and
businesses
of
rivals
such
as
jp
morgan
as
banks
exited
commodities
trading
and
some
parts
of
struggling
rival
noble
group
one
way
to
grow
or
at
least
reduce
your
cost
base
is
consolidation
said
dunand
citing
opportunity
to
reduce
expenses
such
as
back
and
legal
offices
once
you
have
those
in
place
you
don
t
have
to
double
in
size
also
spurring
consolidation
might
be
higher
oil
prices
requiring
larger
working
capital
to
fund
trading
operations
as
well
as
increasing
interest
rates
around
the
world
he
said
mercuria
is
still
looking
to
enter
the
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
market
dunand
said
where
its
rivals
such
as
gunvor
and
trafigura
have
already
carved
out
a
chunk
of
the
increasingly
liquid
market
the
firm
tried
to
gain
exposure
to
lng
earlier
this
year
when
it
was
part
of
a
failed
bid
by
harbour
energy
to
buy
australian
gas
producer
santos
ltd
the
firm
reported
a
gross
profit
of
million
in
down
from
million
in
while
traded
volumes
of
crude
and
refined
products
rose
to
million
tonnes
from
million
tonnes
volumes
will
go
slightly
up
in
and
the
trader
will
have
more
than
percent
of
its
business
in
gas
power
coal
and
metals
trading
and
less
than
percent
in
oil
and
products
