after
decades
of
relying
on
lignite
kosovo
has
been
told
it
needs
to
phase
the
energy
source
out
despite
having
billion
tonnes
of
reserves
the
fifth
largest
in
the
world
last
month
the
world
bank
told
kosovo
it
would
no
longer
support
a
planned
mw
power
plant
it
was
supposed
to
provide
a
partial
risk
guarantee
to
help
unlock
cheaper
loans
for
its
biggest
energy
project
the
world
bank
has
recommended
to
us
to
have
a
mw
solar
park
a
mw
wind
park
and
a
mw

kosovo
s
minister
for
economic
development
said
we
don
t
have
that
luxury
to
do
such
experiments
in
a
poor
country
such
as
kosovo
it
is
a
major
risk
it
is
in
our
national
security
interest
to
secure
base
energy
inside
our
territory
he
told
reuters
other
balkan
countries
rely
on
coal
to
produce
power
with
serbia
and
bosnia
generating
percent
and
percent
respectively
in
ailing
plants
and
both
are
in
the
process
of
adding
new
coal
capacities
power
generator
contourglobal
which
won
the
tender
to
build
kosovo
s
new
plant
and
operate
it
for
two
decades
is
now
trying
to
secure
funds
elsewhere
the
government
committed
to
buying
the
total
output
of
the
plant
at
a
price
yet
to
be
determined
the
two
old
power
plants
kosova
a
and
kosova
b
are
among
europe
s
worst
polluters
the
government
said
the
new
plant
to
replace
kosova
a
would
burn
percent
less
coal
and
release
times
less
emissions
but
power
prices
in
kosovo
among
the
cheapest
in
europe
would
rise
percent
once
the
plant
goes
online
mostly
due
to
investment
for
environmental
protection
lluka
said
by
the
end
of
the
best
bidder
to
build
the
generators
at
the
plant
will
be
picked
from
china
machinery
engineering
a

invested
million
euros
into
kosovo
s
first
solar
park
in
a
sunny
day
in
late
october
the
mw
park
outside
the
western
town
of
gjakova
was
producing
megawatt
hours
of
electricity
the
tariff
for
mwh
of
solar
power
amounts
to
euros
while
mwh
from
plants
is
sold
for
euros
we
see
this
kind
of
investment
as
a
good
opportunity
and
we
are
planning
to
invest
in
more
capacity
said
vlera
devolli
one
of
the
investors
the
country
of
million
people
has
installed
only
mw
of
renewable
capacities
it
hopes
to
double
them
by
the
end
of
this
or
early
next
year
we
should
not
lock
ourselves
that
lignite
is
the
necessary
future
said
learta
hollaj
of
the
institute
for
development
policy
if
you
see
the
costs
to
health
and
environment
then
we
have
a
lot
of
reasons
to
fight
such
