update 1-britain's cuadrilla extracts first shale gas at english fracking site
london

cuadrilla
extracted
its
first
shale
gas
from
its
site
in
northwest
england
it
said
on
friday
after
it
began
fracking
operations
there
just
over
two
weeks
ago
cuadrilla
said
the
gas
flows
were
small
but
coming
at
such
an
early
stage
of
the
project
were
evidence
of
the
potential
of
the
site
this
is
a
good
early
indication
of
the
gas
potential
that
we
have
long
talked
about
cuadrilla
chief
executive
francis
egan
said
in
an
emailed
statement
fracking
or
hydraulically
fracturing
involves
extracting
gas
from
rocks
by
breaking
them
up
with
water
and
chemicals
at
high
pressure
the
practice
which
started
at
the
new
road
site
on
has
been
halted
and
restarted
twice
since
then
after
small
earth
tremors
were
detected
britain
s
regulatory
system
calls
for
any
fracking
to
be
paused
if
any
tremor
of
magnitude
or
above
is
detected
cuadrilla
said
it
plans
to
fully
test
flow
rates
from
the
current
two
exploration
wells
towards
the
end
of
and
into
the
new
year
to
determine
whether
gas
extraction
would
be
viable
fracking
is
opposed
by
environmentalists
and
green
groups
who
say
extracting
more
fossil
fuel
is
at
odds
with
britain
s
commitment
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
but
britain
s
government
is
supportive
of
the
industry
and
is
keen
to
reduce
the
country
s
reliance
on
imports
of
natural
gas
which
is
used
to
heat
around
percent
of
britain
s
homes
the
british
geological
survey
estimates
shale
gas
resources
in
northern
england
alone
could
contain
trillion
cubic
feet
tcf
of
gas
percent
of
which
could
meet
the
country
s
demand
for
almost
years
cuadrilla
which
is
percent
owned
by
australia
s
aj
lucas
and
percent
owned
by
a
fund
managed
by
riverstone
first
extracted
shale
gas
in
england
near
the
coastal
town
of
blackpool
in
the
northwest
in
but
it
was
stopped
after
causing
a
magnitude
earth
tremor
it
said
then
that
the
quake
was
caused
by
an
unusual
combination
of
geological
features
but
it
led
to
an
nationwide
ban
on
fracking
while
further
research
was
carried
out
and
a
new
regulatory
system
was
implemented
