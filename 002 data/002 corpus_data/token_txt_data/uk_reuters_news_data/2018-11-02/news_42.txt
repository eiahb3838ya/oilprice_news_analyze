oil
prices
won
t
rally
and
may
fall
further
in
as
a
slowing
global
economy

the
world
s
biggest
oil
traders
told
the
reuters
global
commodities
summit
oil
prices
briefly
spiked
in
early
october
to
a
high
above
per
barrel
buoyed
by
concerns
about
whether
the
market
would
be
able
to
handle
sanctions
on
iranian
oil
that
kick
in
next
week
estimates
on
how
much
iran
will
be
able
to
export
vary
wildly
and
even
its
current
export
levels
have
become
increasingly
opaque
key
iranian
oil
importers
mainly
in
asia
have
requested
waivers
from
the
sanctions
bloomberg
reported
on
friday
that
waivers
had
been
granted
to
eight
countries

the

firms

staunch
rivals
vitol
gunvor
mercuria
glencore
and
trafigura
meet
over
percent
of
the
world
s
daily
oil
demand
of
over
million
barrels
per
day
crude
markets
are
not
that
tight
in
the
immediate
term
and
a
fair
price
of
oil
going
into
next
year
is
probably
closer
to
the
or
per
barrel
mark
than
the
area
that
some
people
are
talking
about

vitol

of

gunvor
torbjorn
tornqvist
said
oil
prices
will
likely
stay
near
current
levels
of
per
barrel
next
year
as
most
producers
reckon
that
higher
prices
would
destroy
demand
and
create
a
new
glut
except
for
a
few
nations
which
are
perhaps
less
important
than
russia
and
saudi
arabia
i
don
t
see
anybody
wanting

iranian

could

iran

were

that

toll

some

vitol
s
hardy
said
his
firm
had
revised
oil
demand
growth
forecast
to
million
bpd
from
the
previous
million
tornqvist
said
he
expected
washington
to
take
a
pragmatic
approach
and
grant
more
waivers
to
iranian
oil
buyers
if
prices
rallied
above
per

but
take

dunand
said
he
expected
oil
oversupply
to
worsen
and
prices
to
get
softer
compared
to
current
levels
unless
opec
intervened
to
curtail
its
own
production
and
address
the
glut
because
of
trade
tensions
and
a
number
of
other
factors
there
is
plenty
of
risk
that

growth
will
not
be
a
strong
as
originally
anticipated
dunand
said
the
chances
are
that
we
are
going
to
be
building

if
we
start
moving
into
the

i
think
some

will
start
asking
themselves
whether
they
haven

overreacted
