saddling
the

more
than
trillion

his
government
also
had
to
fill
a
revenue
shortfall
from
the
scrapping
of
an
unpopular
consumption
tax
although
the
budget
is
more
than
the
previous
year
you
must
also
remember
that
we
also
carry
the
burden
of
having
to
pay
our
debt
that
was
incurred
by
previous
government
mahathir
told
reporters
after
his
finance
minister
presented
the
budget
to
parliament
but
with
malaysia
now
forecasting
this
year
s
fiscal
deficit
would
be
the
highest
in
five
years
it
will
face
worries
over
whether
it
can
avoid
a
possible
credit
rating
downgrade
sagarika
chandra
associate
director
in
fitch
ratings
sovereigns
team
said
the
government
s
failure
to
stick
to
a
more
conservative
fiscal
consolidation
path
raises
some
concerns
about
policy
finance
minister
lim
guan
eng
said
total
revenue
is
projected
to
rise
percent
to
billion
ringgit
next
year
thanks
largely
to
the
petronas
dividend
expenditure
has
been
budgeted
at
billion
ringgit
billion
up
percent
from
this
year
s
budget
as
the
government
recognised
certain
items
not
listed
in
the
previous
budget
mahathir
said
the
government
will
issue
before
march
a
billion
yen
samurai
bond
with
low
interest
rates
to
pay
back
some
of
the
costly
loans
taken
by
the
previous
administration
more
japanese
loans
were
possible
he
said
the
government
abandoned
an
earlier
fiscal
deficit
target
of
percent
for
this
year
saying
it
will
widen
to
percent
the
highest
since
najib
s
government
had
reduced
fiscal
deficit
for
eight
straight
years
to
it
is
targeting
fiscal
deficit
of
pct
in
and
percent
by
and
percent
over
the
medium
term
the
government
said
it
was
resetting
its
fiscal
consolidation
path
starting
from
to
account
for
narrow
revenue
base
additional
provision
for
items
and
tax
in
an
economic
report
released
on
friday
malaysia
said
it
will
cut
public
spending
sharply
despite
foreseeing
the
economy
growing
more
slowly
lim
and
mahathir
blamed
the
najib
administration
for
the
wider
deficits
najib
is
facing
multiple
charges
of
corruption
money
laundering
and
abuse
of
power
mostly
related
to
a
defunct
state
fund
development
bhd
the
former
leader
has
denied
any
wrongdoing
and
has
accused
his
successors
of
trying
to
belittle
his
economic
successes
najib
had
introduced
the
consumption
tax
which
mahathir
scrapped
to
reduce
reliance
on
oil
and
gas
revenue
but
the
new
budget
shows
an
increasing
dependence
on
petronas
which
mahathir
said
could
afford
to
pay
more
to
the
government
because
of
higher
oil
prices
other
than
the
special
dividend
petronas
will
also
pay
a
regular
dividend
of
billion
ringgit
its
dividends
alone
account
for
about
percent
of
malaysia
s
revenue
next
year
much
of
petronas
dividends
will
go
towards
settle
outstanding
tax
refunds
a
heavier
reliance
on
revenues
presents
an
additional
risk
to
malaysia
s
fiscal
accounts
in
the
absence
of
more
structural
measures
andrew
wood
an
analyst
at
s
p
global
ratings
said
the
government
will
also
sell
state
assets
and
land
privatise
infrastructure
assets
review
existing
tax
structures
and
incentives
offered
to
companies
to
boost
revenue
prospects
it
is
also
reviewing
several
projects
awarded
by
the
previous
