reuters
as
oil
production
rises
setting
records
in
average
daily
output
nearly
every
month
this
year
the
companies
that
convert
crude
to
diesel
and
gasoline
are
increasing
their
ability
to
consume
more
crude
and
generate
higher
profits
using
more
efficient
equipment
and
running
bigger
plants
at
peak
speeds
the
combined
capacity
of
nation
s
refineries
was
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
at
the
start
of
the
year
up
percent
over
the
million
bpd
in
when
there
were
refineries
according
to
energy
information
administration
data
demand
for
new
products
coming
from
these
expansions
will
lead
to
higher
refinery
utilization
higher
distillate
prices
and
higher
refinery
margins

a

wrote
in

report
on
thursday
refinery
utilization
or
how
much
of
the
capacity
is
being
used
hit
a
record
percent
in
early
august
the
eia
said
utilization
differs
from
capacity
due
to
weather
or
maintenance
disruptions
market
demand
and
other
factors
this
year
high
production
and
ample
supplies
of
shale
and
heavy
canadian
oil
have
made
refiners
very
profitable
refining
income
this
year
through
september
at
phillips
was
billion
up
percent
from
the
year
earlier
valero
energy
s
refining
business
posted
an
operating
profit
of
billion
up
percent
just
as
shale
producers
are
exporting
more
refiners
which
convert
crude
into
fuels
should
be
able
to
drive
exports
of
marine
fuel
and
profits
higher
next
year
earning
from
such
sales
can
remain
strong
through
at
least
moody

saluja
said
between
and
exports
of
finished
refined
products
climbed
by

to
million

accounting
for
a
national
increase
of

petroleum

acquired
andeavor
in
part
to
gain
andeavor

ability
to
process

because
of
its

in

six
of

owned
by
