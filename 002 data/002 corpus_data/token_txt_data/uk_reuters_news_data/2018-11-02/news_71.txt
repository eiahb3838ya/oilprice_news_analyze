were
weighed
down
by
rising

the

cartel
of
the

of

opec
boosted
oil
production
in

to
the
highest
since
at
million
barrels
per

bpd
a
reuters
survey
found
this
week
that
s
up
bpd
from
september
and
the
highest
by
opec
since
december
just
before
the
group
started
to
voluntarily
withhold
supply
in
january
in
order
to
prop
up
prices
meanwhile
crude
oil
production
surged
by
bpd
to
a
record
million
bpd
in
august
the
energy
information
administration
eia
said
in
a
monthly
report
this
week
on
a
weekly
basis
crude
production
stood
at
million
bpd
last
week
growth
in
crude
oil
production
has
averaged
almost
million
barrels
per
day
in
the
first
eight
months
of
the
year
with
output
from
many
key
producing
regions
reaching

said

the
united

is
now
in
a
race
with
russia
as
top
producer
russian
oil
production
has
risen
to
a
record
high
of
million
bpd
so
far
in
october
up
from
million
bpd
in
september
with
saudi
arabia
pumping
out
million
bpd
so
far
in
october
combined
output
from
the
top
three
oil
producers
is
now
higher
than
ever
at
million
bpd
meaning
that
russia
the
united
states
and
saudi
arabia
alone
meet
more
than
a
third
of
the
world
s
almost
million
bpd
of
crude
oil
consumption
despite
the
surge
in
output
concerns
lingered
as
washington
is
set
to
impose
its
sanctions
against
iran
s
petroleum
exports
from
next
week
clayton
allen
of
height
securities
said
iran
s
biggest
oil
customers
all
in
asia
were
seeking
waivers
to
sanctions
against
iran
s
petroleum
exports
thus
far
potential
waivers
appear
targeted
at
india
and
south
korea
and
they
require
some
reductions
over
current
import
volumes
while
still
allowing
oil
to
flow
he
said
we
think
trump
will
agree
to
china
importing
some
volumes
similar
to
the
treatment
that
india
and
south
korea
receive
he
said
japan
is
seeking
a
similar
deal
despite
these
efforts
allen
said
any
potential
iran
oil
sanction
waivers
would
likely
only
be
temporary
the
may
use
waivers
to
slow
walk
implementation
but
these
will
not
apply
indefinitely
