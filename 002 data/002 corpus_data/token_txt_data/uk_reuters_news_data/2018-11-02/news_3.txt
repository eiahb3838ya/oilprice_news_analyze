russian
steelmaker
mmk
reported
its
strongest
quarter
in
a
decade
on
friday
but
it
postponed
the
relaunch
of
steel
production
in
turkey
and
warned
that
falling
prices
could
hit
profits
in
its
final
quarter
the
relaunch
of
steel
production
at
its
turkish
site
was
expected
to
add
as
much
as
million
to
mmk
s
core
earnings
but
was
delayed
earlier
this
year
due
to
rising
trade
tensions
and
a
surge
in
protectionist
measures
mmk
s
earnings
before
interest
taxation
depreciation
and
amortisation
ebitda
rose
percent
to
million
the
highest
since
at
least
beating
forecasts
of
million
in
a
reuters
poll
revenue
rose
percent
to
billion
while
mmk
said
it
sees
stable
demand
for
steel
products
in
its
markets
supported
by
growth
in
global
steel
consumption
and
a
programme
to
reduce
production
capacity
in
china
it
also
warned
that
global
steel
prices
could
put
pressure
on
results
the
company
s
financial
results
for
the
fourth
quarter
will
be
affected
by
the
decrease
in
global
steel
prices
and
seasonal
correction
in
the
domestic
market
against
a
backdrop
of
stabilising
prices
for
key
raw
materials
mmk
said
in
its
statement
mmk
had
intended
to
decide
the
fate
of
the
metalurji
complex
in
turkey
in
november
but
has
put
back
the
decision
until
andrey
eremin
mmk
director
for
economics
said
on
a
conference
call
we
actually
made
a
decision
to
postpone
the
launch
of
part
of
turkish
business
and
the
main
reason
for
this
is
that
volatility
of
the
potential
profitability
in
the
steel
sector
is
unpredictably
high
eremin
said
analysts
also
noted
that
mmk
s
capital
expenditure
was
expected
to
exceed
the
previously
planned
million
due
to
an
acceleration
of
its
investment
programme
the
firm
controlled
by
russian
businessman
viktor
rashnikov
recommended
a
dividend
payment
of
roubles
