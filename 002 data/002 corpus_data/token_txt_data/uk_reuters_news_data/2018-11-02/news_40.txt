the

trade
singh
said
the
united
states
plans
to
impose

tonnes
of
iranian
crude
in
october
sources
last
month
told

india
was
hopeful
of
receiving
a
waiver
from

as
the
country
had
substantially
reduced
its
oil
purchases
from
tehran
an
indian
government
source
told
reuters
the
united
states
could
announce
a
waiver
for
new
delhi
on
sunday
india
would
continue
to
buy
iranian

in
the
current
fiscal
year
to
march
but
to
secure
the
waiver
it
may
agree
to
cut

further
the
government
source
said
singh
said
india
had
in
the
past
paid
for
iranian
oil
through
various
mechanisms
including
part
payment
in
rupees
part
payment
in
euros
and
also
deferred

all
such
options
are
still
being
debated
he
said
separately
indian
oil
s
head
of
finance
a
k
sharma
said
iran
had
sometimes
agreed
to
accept
payment
in
rupees
from
indian
oil
we
have
settled
payments
in
this
financial
year
for
iran
through
uco
bank
he
said
adding
that
it
would
help
the
indian
currency
if
iran
started
taking
payment
in
rupees
if
the
requirement
for
dollars
is
less
it
helps
sharma
said
he
said
indian
refiners
had
also
asked
other
oil
suppliers
to
start
taking
payment
in
rupees
an
issue
that
