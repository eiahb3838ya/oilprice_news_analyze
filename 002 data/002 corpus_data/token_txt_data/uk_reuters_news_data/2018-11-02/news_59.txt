two
years
the

the

continues
to
be
involved
in
gas
distribution
in
the
asia
pacific
and
is
working

it
believes
that
replacing
coal

gas
is
the
easiest
and
quickest
way
to
reduce
greenhouse

emissions
in
the
region

a
project
in

the
fact
that

sold
our

doesn
t
mean
that
we
have
no
need
for

trading
because
from
time

time
we
need
cargoes
holleaux
said
lng
globally
will
be
growing
trading
will
be
growing
because
there
are
needs
for
adjustment
to
supplies
for
this
market
we
ll
just
be
a
small
part
of
this
for
renewables

is
seeking
to
expand
its

share
in

working
with
partners
such
as

if
