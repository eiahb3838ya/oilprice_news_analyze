gas
company
cuadrilla
said
on
friday
it
had
seen
the
first
natural
gas
flow
at
its
site
in
northwest
england
since

began
fracking

there
just
over
two
weeks
ago
cuadrilla
told
reuters
that
gas
flows
at
such
an
early
stage
of
the
project
were
evidence
of
the
potential
of
future
gas
recovery
at
the
site
even
though
the
flows
were
small
this
is
a
good
early
indication
of
the
gas
potential
that
we
have
long
talked
about
