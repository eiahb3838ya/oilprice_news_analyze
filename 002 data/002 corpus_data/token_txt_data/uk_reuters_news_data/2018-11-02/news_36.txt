world
shares
rallied
on
friday
on
hopes
that
the
united
states
and
china
were
starting
to
repair
their
badly
damaged
trade
relations
while
bumper
wage
data
helped
the
dollar
regain
some
strength
the
signals
on
trade
triggered
a
global
surge
in
risk
appetite
that
lifted
metals
and
swathes
of
currencies
and
bond
markets
but
it
was
equities
that
saw
the
strongest
reaction
a
buoyant
asian
session
where
most
of
the
major
markets
gained
by

percent
put
emerging

stocks
up
percent
and
on

after

report
spurred

expectations
job
growth
rebounded
sharply
last

and
wages
recorded
their
largest
annual
gain

the
data
showed
pointing
to
further
labour

tightening
that
could
encourage
the
federal
reserve
to
raise
interest
rates
again
in
december
those
numbers
contrasted
with
data
this
week
showing
slowing
factory
growth
around
the
world
but
for
the
day
at
least
those
worries
were
soothed
by
the
brighter
mood
the
focus
now
is
on
whether
the
strong
jobs
report
particularly
the
wages
data
will
help
push
and
bond
yields
up
towards
percent
the
signs
are
that
it
could
european
bond
yields
were
already
up
before
the
data
and
the
treasury
yield
looked
to
be
creeping
higher
again
too
the
figures
also
helped
the
dollar
claw
off

make
some
ground

higher

after
enjoying
its
best

if

it
will
be
its
week
of
the

were
it
not

bnp
paribas
analysts
said
in
a
note
the
expected
rise
on
wall
street
is
likely
to
be
tempered
by
apple
shares
which
tumbled
percent
in
premarket
trading
after
the
company
warned
on
thursday
about
its
upcoming
holiday
season
sales
in
an
interview
with
reuters
apple
ceo
tim
cook
said
some
of
the
forecast
disappointment
was
explained
by
releasing
its
iphone
models
the
xs
and
xs
max
in
the
fiscal
fourth
quarter
cook
also
said
foreign
exchange
rates
would
have
a
billion
negative
impact
on
apple
s
sales
forecast
cook
added
the
firm
was
also
seeing
some
macroeconomic
weakness
in
some
of
the
emerging
markets
although
he
didn
t
specify
which
ones
the
tech
sector
has
taken
a
beating
on
wall
street
over
the
last
month
and
apple
s
weak
forecast
fed
into
the
same
investor
fears
that
have
caused

of
facebook
amazon

google
to
tumble
