both russian and u.s. gas are in germany's future energy mix - official
berlin
reuters
germany
will
likely
be
a
buyer
of
liquid
natural
gas
from
the
united
states
in
the
medium
term
the
government
official
tasked
with
relations
said
on
friday
but
not
as
a
result
of
any
threats
from
washington
peter
beyer
berlin
s
coordinator
for
relations
with
north
america
said
germany
needs
to
diversify
its
energy
mix
as
north
sea
gas
runs
out
and
insisted
that
a
russian
pipeline
vehemently
opposed
by
washington
was
needed
berlin
s
ties
with
the
united
states
have
been
under
immense
strain
since
president
donald
trump
took
office
and
the
planned
nord
stream
pipeline
which
would
bring
russian
gas
straight
to
germany
under
the
baltic
sea
has
been
a
particular
concern
germany
s
energy
sources
in
the
north
sea
for
example
are
running
out
and
we
have
a
responsibility
to
spread
risks
he
told
reuters
on
friday
conceding
that
the
pipeline
would
likely
bring
a
sharpening
of
washington
s
sanctions
regime
washington
has
threatened
to
impose
sanctions
on
companies
that
participate
in
the
building
of
projects
like
nord
stream
which
officials
say
helps
the
kremlin
finance
destabilizing
activities
around
the
world
as
well
as
cutting
ukraine
out
of
lucrative
transit
fees
as
it
battles
separatists
i
personally
expect
that
we
will
see
a
sharpening
of
the
sanctions
guidelines
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
he
said
whether
that
means
we
actually
get
tougher
sanctions
i
don
t
yet
the
which
has
become
a
major
exporter
of
gas
thanks
to
shale
drilling
is
keen
to
open
new
markets
by
ensuring
energy
net
importers
like
industrial
powerhouse
germany
construct
terminals
capable
of
receiving
liquefied
gas
beyer
said
that
lng
was
still
too
expensive
to
be
competitive
with
other
energy
sources
but
that
this
would
likely
change
as
the
market
expanded
though
it
was
not
yet
clear
whether
berlin
would
provide
financial
support
for
the
building
of
such
a
port
as
many
urge
he
added
that
washington
had
escalated
its
willingness
to
threaten
sanctions
in
pursuit
of
its
foreign
policy
goals
in
recent
months
including
its
attempts
to
hinder
european
companies
trading
with
iran
