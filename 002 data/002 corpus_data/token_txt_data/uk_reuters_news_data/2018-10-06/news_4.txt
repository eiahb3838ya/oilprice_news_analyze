nigeria
s
main
opposition
party
which
this
weekend
selects
its
candidate
to
challenge
president
muhammadu
buhari
in
an
election
in
february
is
aiming
to
make
his
northwestern
power
base
a
main
battleground
in
the
contest
to
do
so
however
it
needs
to
secure
the
backing
of
powerful
figures
in
the
northwest
and
to
ensure
the
party
does
not
fracture
over
its
choice
of
candidate
analysts
said
many
of
the
candidates
for
the
people
s
democratic
party
pdp
nomination
defected
from
buhari
s
ruling
all
progressives
congress
apc
in
recent
months
seven
have
ties
with
states
in
the
northwest
mostly
as
current
or
past
governors
bolstering
the
party
in
a
traditional
buhari
stronghold
at
stake
in
the
primary
election
is
the
chance
to
face
him
in
a
presidential
contest
which
will
determine
who
controls
a
country
that
is
africa
s
top
oil
producer
has
one
of
the
continent
s
biggest
economies
and
plays
a
key
role
in
regional
wars
against
islamist
insurgents
the
northwest
the
most
densely
populated
region
in
the
country
of
million
people
is
shaping
up
to
take
centre
stage
in
the
race
in
past
elections
buhari
got
almost
half
of
his
vote
from
the
northwest
and
the
region
will
be
even
more
important
this
time
said
malte
liewerscheidt
west
africa
analyst
at
teneo
intelligence
a
lot
of
people
from
other
regions
who
voted
for
buhari
in
are
likely
to
turn
their
back
on
the
region
is
traditionally
the
centre
of
the
muslim
voter
base
as
nigeria
s
three
most
senior
islamic
leaders
the
sultan
of
sokoto
the
emir
of
kano
and
the
emir
of
gwando
are
based
there
buhari
a
northern
muslim
who
won
the
election
at
the
fourth
attempt
took
million
votes
in
kano
state
compared
to
secured
by
goodluck
jonathan
a
christian
southerner
an
unofficial
agreement
aimed
at
rotating
power
between
the
mainly
muslim
north
and
mostly
christian
south
means
a
northern
candidate
is
likely
to
be
selected
by
the
opposition
the
northerners
in
the
primary
contest
include
the
governor
of
northwestern
sokoto
state
aminu
tambuwal
former
kano
governor
ibrahim
shekarau
governor
ahmed
makarfi
and
former
sokoto
governor
attahiru
bafarawa
assuming
that
the
pdp
remains
united
this
could
put
them
back
on
the
map
in
the
northwest
a
region
where
the
party
scored
on
average
merely
percent
in
teneo
s
liewerscheidt
said
pdp
national
publicity
secretary
kola
ologbondiyan
dismissed
the
suggestion
that
supporters
of
unsuccessful
candidates
may
not
back
the
person
selected
we
are
all
going
to
work
together
to
ensure
the
victory
of
our
candidate
he
said
the
dent
in
buhari
s
popularity
can
largely
be
attributed
to
the
economy
nigeria
entered
its
first
recession
in
years
in
mainly
caused
by
lower
oil
prices
and
attacks
in
the
niger
delta
crude
production
region
it
emerged
from
recession
early
last
year
but
growth
remains
sluggish
and
inflation
has
remained
high
above
the
central
bank
s
single
digit
target
range
the
impact
of
the
economic
downturn
of
recent
years
is
for
some
on
the
streets
of
the
north
s
commercial
hub
kano
a
reason
to
reject
buhari
everything
went
back
under
buhari
there
s
no
progress
or
development
said
yusuf
yakubu
who
left
buhari
s
party
in
june
and
joined
the
pdp
if
you
go
to
the
market
the
traders
will
tell
you
the
economy
has
collapsed
under
this
administration
there
is
really
nothing
kano
can
hold
up
and
say
this
is
how
we
ve
benefited
under
buhari
he
said
but
many
others
on
the
streets
of
the
city
felt
that
the
president
who
is
from
the
neighbouring
state
of
katsina
should
be
given
a
second
term
perhaps
we
all
would
not
be
in
kano
state
by
now
if
not
for
his
administration
maybe
we
would
have
all
been
chased
out
of
this
state
by
boko
haram
