india
on
saturday
sought
to
assure
investors
that
the
government
would
not
go
back
to
regulating
fuel
prices
a
day
after
oil
company
shares
tumbled
on
concerns
about
a
return
to
a
regime
that
has
hurt
their
profits
in
the
past
the
government
said
on
thursday
it
was
cutting
gasoline
and
diesel
by
rupees
per
liter
to
help
indians
struggling
to
pay
fuel
prices
that
had
climbed
on
the
back
of
a
rise
in
global
crude
prices
and
a
weakening
rupee
the
move
was
seen
as
a
reversal
of
a
decision
to
scrap
regulated
fuel
prices
a
regime
that
was
blamed
for
deterring
state
oil
marketing
firms
from
expanding
and
for
choking
off
investment
in
domestic
oil
fields
by
india
s
biggest
oil
producer

assure
all
that
there
is
no

of

saying
it

competition
among
vehicle

retailers
and
enhance
efficiency
in

was
one
