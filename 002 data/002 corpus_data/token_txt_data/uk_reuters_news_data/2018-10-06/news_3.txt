worried zimbabweans fill up cars and stockpile goods, bank sees improvement soon
harare
reuters
zimbabwe
s
central
bank
governor
sought
to
reassure
the
public
on
saturday
as
people
again
formed
long
queues
to
fill
up
their
cars
in
the
capital
with
others
basic
goods
like
cooking
oil
and
sugar
the
panic
has
been
caused
by
recent
changes
introduced
by
the
government
and
a
worsening
dollar
crunch
but
the
governor
john
mangudya
told
reuters
that
people
should
not
be
worried
and
that
he
expected
an
improvement
in
the
next
hours
the
problem
is
that
we
did
not
explain
things
this
economy
is
a
sentiment
driven
economy
so
we
need
to
communicate
more
with
the
society
he
said
the
southern
african
nation
dumped
its
currency
in
favor
of
the
dollar
in
but
a
shortage
of
cash
dollars
has
worsened
following
a
disputed
election
won
by
president
emmerson
mnangagwa
in
july
fuel
queues
started
building
up
this
week
and
on
saturday
outlets
in
harare
had
either
run
out
or
had
long
queues
as
drivers
patiently
waited
for
their
turn
to
fill
up
their
tanks
i
have
been
here
for
an
hour
because
the
queue
is
moving
slowly
i
have
no
choice
because
i
need
the
petrol
said
one
motorist
who
identified
himself
as
pascal
at
a
service
station
in
the
avondale
suburb
in
harare
at
some
outlets
owned
by
total
attendants
only
served
motorists
with
cards
other
outlets
refused
mobile
payments
preferring
bank
cards
and
cash
zimbabwe
spends
million
on
fuel
imports
every
month
mangudya
told
reuters
the
fuel
shortages
had
been
caused
by
an
introduction
of
a
percent
tax
on
electronic
payments
last
monday
which
meant
oil
firms
would
incur
weekly
bank
charges
of
for
fuel
imports
but
were
not
allowed
to
pass
the
cost
to
consumers
the
companies
had
stopped
supplying
fuel
as
a
result
mangudya
said
but
he
added
the
situation
would
improve
in
the
next
hours
because
the
government
on
friday
night
scrapped
the
tax
on
foreign
payments
zimbabweans
were
also
stocking
up
on
basic
goods
like
rice
cooking
oil
sugar
and
juice
at
some
branches
owned
by
zimbabwe
s
biggest
grocery
chain
ok
zimbabwe
management
limited
sales
of
sugar
cooking
oil
and
a
popular
local
juice
management
reserves
the
right
to
limit
quantities
read
a
notice
to
customers
a
shortage
of
dollars
in
banks
has
forced
importers
to
purchase
them
on
the
black
market
which
has
pushed
up
premiums
and
the
price
of
imports
on
the
black
market
the
premium
for
the
dollar
spiked
to
a
new
record
on
saturday
reaching
percent
from
percent
on
monday
traders
said
that
means
buying
in
cash
via
a
bank
transfer
cost
up
from
earlier
this
week
the
situation
has
not
been
helped
by
mangudya
s
decision
early
this
week
to
order
banks
to
open
accounts
for
clients
who
earn
foreign
currency
and
separate
their
money
from
dollars
in
the
local
banking
system
known
as
zollars
analysts
said
the
move
effectively
makes
the
dollar
surrogates
zimbabwe
s
local
currency
there
are
billion
of
zollars
in
banks
compared
to
million
in
reserves
official
data
showed
a
mismatch
that
creates
a
premium
for
the
dollar
and
fans
the
black
market
