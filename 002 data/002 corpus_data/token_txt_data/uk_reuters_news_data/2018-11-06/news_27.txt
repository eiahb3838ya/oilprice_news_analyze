european
shares
sagged
and
the
dollar
and
bond
markets
barely
budged
on
tuesday
as
traders
braced
for
midterm
elections
in
the
united
states
and
potentially
lively
sessions
ahead
japan
and
hong
kong
had
helped
asia
overcome
another
chinese
wobble

europe
was
in
the
percent

street
futures
the
elections
mark
the
first
major
test
of
president
donald
trump
s
sweeping
tax
cuts
and
hostile
trade
policies
polls
point
to
his
republican
party
losing
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
which
could
curb
some
of
his
policymaking
power
with
so
much
at
stake
currency
market
moves
were
extremely
tight
the
dollar
hardly
moved
against
the
euro
lost
ground
to
sterling
but
made
some
back
against
the
yen
as
dealers
kept
their
options
open
it
is
definitely
not
the
time
to
buy
the
dip
said
london
capital
s
chief
investment
officer
pau
referring
to
and
stock
markets
and
risk
assets
everything
that
could
go
well
for
consumers
in
the
last
couple
of
years
has
gone
well
but
now
the
tide
is
turning
at
the
moment
you
are
running
out
of
drivers
of
growth
in
the
there
was
plenty
for
investors
to
digest
from
europe
too
italian
and
spanish
stocks
and
bonds
weakened
as
updated
pmi
figures
confirmed
euro
zone
business
growth
had
fallen
to
a
low
last
month
against
the
backdrop
of
trade
tensions
the
future
output
index
caused
even
more
concern
as
it
fell
to
a
near
low
euro
zone
companies
reported
a
disappointing
start
to
the
fourth
quarter
said
chris
williamson
chief
business
economist
at
ihs
markit
which
compiles
the
data
italian
politics
also
played
on
the
nerves
too
after
euro
zone
finance
ministers
had
called
on
rome
to
change
its
budget
at
a
meeting
late
on
monday
with
italy
unlikely
to
bow
to
the
demands
any
time
soon
it
pointed
to
a
further
escalation
in
the
damaging
feud
and
pushed
italian
borrowing
costs
up
basis
points
on
the
day
countries
have
entered
into
the
excessive
deficit
procedure
and
has
ever
got
a
fine
so
my
gut
feeling
is
that
they
italy
won
t
get
one
just
a
slap
on
the
wrist
said
lyn
strategist
at
rabobank
the
uncertainty
over
the
midterms
for
stocks
futures
was
understandable
the
s
p
has
risen
percent
since
trump
s
election
in
november
which
is
more
than
under
any
other
president
in
the
past
years
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
had
edged
up
percent
overnight
following
a
positive
finish
for
wall
street
on
monday
japan
s
nikkei
also
climbed
percent
although
weaker
chinese
markets
and
regional
technology
shares
capped
the
region
apple
suppliers
such
as
taiwan
s
hon
hai
precision
industry
were
hit
by
a
report
that
apple
had
told
its
smartphone
assemblers
to
halt
plans
for
additional
production
lines
dedicated
to
the
iphone
xr
the
report
had
also
driven
apple
shares
percent
lower
in
trade
while
political
gridlock
between
the
white
house
and
congress
could
hinder
trump
s
agenda
and
raise
concerns
about
political
instability
some
analysts
say
this
may
have
already
been
priced
in
by
investors
the
cboe
skew
index
also
known
as
the
black
swan
index
hovered
not
far
from
its
low
hit
on
friday
indicating
demand
for
options
that
provide
protection
remains
tepid
a
higher
skew
typically
indicates
investors
are
buying
more
protection
on
heightened
anxiety
unlike
the
presidential
election
or
the
s
brexit
referendum
the
upcoming
midterm
elections
are
not
a
binary
event
said
yasuo
sakuma
chief
investment
officer
at
libra
investments
so
it
s
unlikely
to
send
stocks
significantly
in
one
direction
apart
from
initial
quick
gold
was
little
changed
but
in
oil
markets
crude
prices
were
down
near
lows
after
the
united
states
allowed
eight
countries
to
continue
buying
oil
from
iran
temporarily
easing
the
likelihood
of
a
sharp
