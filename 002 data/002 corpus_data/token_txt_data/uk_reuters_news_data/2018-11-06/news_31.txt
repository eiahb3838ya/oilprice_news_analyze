sanctions
on
iran
are
unlikely
to
impact
the
oil
market
due
to
a
glut
in
supplies
globally
but
iran
s
production
capacity
could
be
hit
due
to
a
possible
squeeze
in
investments
the
head
of
research
at
abu
dhabi
investment
authority
adia
said
big
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
russia
the
united
states
and
others
have
enough
capacity
to
ensure
global
supply
analysts
at
adia
and
citigroup
said
you
can
t
exclude
spikes
but
basically
there
s
too
much
oil
in
the
world
and
that
will
prevail
in
the
christof
ruhl
head
of
global
research
at
adia
said
on
the
sidelines
of
a
financial
conference
in
abu
dhabi
the
system
has
already
shown
that
there
s
ample
surplus
capacity
in
the
world
to
more
than
meet
the
amount
of
oil
taken
out
of
iran
for
the
time
being
said
ed
morse
managing
director
global
head
of
commodities
research
at
citi
there
is
significant
production
coming
out
of
the
united
states
canada
brazil
and
middle
eastern
countries
he
said
citi
s
outlook
for
prices
is
strong
prices
of
a
barrel
through
the
winter
and
then
with
coming
production
brent
will
end
at
the
united
states
on
monday
restored
sanctions
targeting
iran
s
oil
banking
and
transport
sectors
and
threatened
more
action
to
stop
what
washington
called
its
outlaw
policies
steps
tehran
called
economic
warfare
and
vowed
to
defy
washington
however
gave
exemptions
to
eight
importers
china
india
south
korea
japan
italy
greece
taiwan
and
turkey
this
group
takes
as
much
as
of
iran
s
seaborne
oil
exports
trade
data
shows
meaning
iran
will
still
be
allowed
to
export
some
oil
for
now
iran
s
crude
exports
could
fall
to
little
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
november
roughly
a
third
of
their
peak
but
traders
and
analysts
say
that
figure
could
rise
from
december
as
importers
use
their
waivers
when
production
declines
it
damages
fields
and
capacity
and
that
is
more
important
in
the
medium
to
long
term
said
ruhl
it
is
not
going
to
help
the
sector
it
means
pulling
out
investments
it
means
financial
isolation
declining
exports
and
revenues
and
potentially
declining
production
he
said
adding
that
it
depends
on
how
stringently
the
sanctions
are
executed
iran
s
ability
to
store
crude
oil
is
crucial
to
keep
production
up
rather
than
its
ability
to
sell
in
the
short
term
