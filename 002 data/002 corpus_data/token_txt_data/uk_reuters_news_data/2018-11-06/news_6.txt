president
tayyip
erdogan
said
on
tuesday
turkey
would
not
abide
by
the
renewed
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
and
shipping
industries
as
they
were
aimed
at
unbalancing
the
world
washington
reimposed
the
sanctions
on
monday
ditching
a
deal
between
world
powers
and
iran
over
its
nuclear
programme
the
measures
temporarily
allow
some
major
customers
including
turkey
to
continue
buying
iranian
crude
but
erdogan
condemned
the
sanctions
these
are
steps
aimed
at
unbalancing
the
world
we
don
t
want
to
live
in
an
imperialist
world
these
issues
will
be
put
on
the
table
at
the
summit
this
weekend
in
paris
he
told
reporters
we
will
absolutely
not
abide
by
such
sanctions
we
buy
billion
cubic
metres
of
natural
gas
we
can
not
freeze
our
people
in
the
nato
member
turkey
depends
heavily
on
imports
to
meet
its
energy
needs
and
neighbouring
iran
has
been
one
of
its
main
suppliers
of
oil
because
of
its
proximity
the
quality
of
its
crude
and
favourable
price
differentials
in
an
interview
erdogan
s
spokesman
ibrahim
kalin
mentioned
a
temporary
waiver
period
of
six
months
and
said
turkey
would
evaluate
developments
during
this
time
when
holding
talks
following
the
end
of
their
exemption
we
are
not
going
to
abandon
our
interests
because
the
united
states
is
imposing
sanctions
on
this
or
that
country
for
whatever
reason
kalin
said
we
will
evaluate
the
period
but
we
will
not
compromise
our
principles
at
the
table
he
told
broadcaster
haberturk
late
on
tuesday
speaking
in
japan
earlier
on
tuesday
turkey
s
foreign
minister
said
it
would
be
dangerous
to
isolate
iran
and
it
was
not
easy
for
countries
like
turkey
and
japan
to
diversify
energy
supplies
we
do
not
believe
any
result
can
be
reached
with
sanctions
i
think
meaningful
dialogue
and
talks
are
more
useful
than
sanctions
mevlut
cavusoglu
said
president
donald
trump
aims
to
hit
iran
s
economy
and
force
it
to
abandon
not
only
its
nuclear
ambitions
and
ballistic
missile
programme
but
also
its
support
for
militant
proxies
in
syria
yemen
lebanon
and
other
parts
of
the
middle
east
erdogan
will
attend
a
summit
to
commemorate
the
end
of
world
war
one
in
paris
over
the
weekend
where
he
is
expected
to
have
talks
with
trump
over
issues
including
the
renewed
sanctions
and
policy
in
syria
