reaching
a
deal
with
international
companies

the
new

said
the
shortfall
in
oil

caused

sanctions
on

had
yet
to
be
gauged

could
decide
what
action
to
take

their
policy

reach
around
million
bpd
iraq
currently
pumps
around
million
bpd
second
only
to
saudi
arabia
in
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
the
bulk
of
iraq
s
oil
is
exported
via
its
southern
terminals
which
account
for
more
than
percent
of
state
revenue
upgrading
capacity
especially
in
the
south
is
a
top
priority
ghadhban
told
reuters
in
his
first
interview
since
taking
over
at
the
ministry
last
month
we
have
had
talks
with
international
companies
which
lasted
for
a
while
but
now
we
are
about
to
reach
a
deal
and
will
settle
this
issue
soon
he
said
in
the
coming
years
iraq
plans
to
boost
export
capacity
to
million
bpd
after
upgrading
its
infrastructure
ghadhban
said
this
would
include
million
bpd
from
southern
oilfields
with
million
bpd
to
become
available
after
a
new
pipeline
from
the
northern
city
of
kirkuk
to
turkey
s
ceyhan
port
on
the
mediterranean
is
built
the
country
is
trying
to
recover
from
years
of
violence
including
a
war
with
islamic
state
militants
that
wrecked
infrastructure
baghdad
is
also
seeking
to
reduce
corruption
and
manage
rivalries
with
the
kurdish
authorities
who
run
areas
in
the
north
ghadhban
who
replaced
jabar
as
minister
is
also
looking
to
diversify
iraq
s
export
outlets
through
new
pipelines
one
of
iraq
s
immediate
challenges
will
be
to
gauge
the
shortfall
in
global
oil
supply
caused
by
sanctions
washington
reimposed
on
iran
s
oil
sector
on
monday
ghadhban
said
iraq
wanted
to
see
the
actual
decrease
before
baghdad
and
other
opec
members
decide
how
to
deal
with
a
reduction
in
iranian
shipments
what
will
be
the
physical
increase
in
demand
on
iraqi
oil
if
there
s
no
demand
how
can
i
say
we
ll
compensate
ghadhban
did
not
specify
what
oil
price
he
expected
for
he
said
a
price
above
per
barrel
was
fair
and
that
the
higher
the
price
the
better
it
was
for
iraq
i
compare
it
with
previous
prices
when
we
talk
about
prices
above
i
say
it
s
a
fair
price
it
s
not
or
and
it
s
not
in
principle
the
higher
the
price
the
better
for
iraq
but
we
re
not
working
alone
we
re
a
member
of
opec
we
see
the
interests
of
consumers
and
we
want
to
be
a
viable
producer
and
exporter
ghadhban
said
washington
s
sanctions
target
iran
s
oil
banking
and
transport
sectors
and
it
has
threatened
more
action
to
stop
what
it
calls
outlaw
policies
steps
that
tehran
called
economic
warfare
and
vowed
to
defy
a
official
confirmed
iraq
had
been
granted
a
waiver
to
import
some
iranian
products
iraqi
officials
said
last
week
baghdad
would
still
be
allowed
to
import
crucial
gas
and
energy
supplies
for
its
power
stations
as
well
as
food
items
in
a
tumultuous
region
iraq
hopes
to
have
more
avenues
for
export
the
oil
ministry
received
bids
from
three
foreign
contractors
to
build
a
giant
water
treatment
facility
vital
for
the
opec
member
to
grow
its
oil
production
capacity
ghadhban
said
he
said
he
expected
work
to
begin
in
early
and
that
the
cost
of
the
project
was
several
billion
dollars
an
additional
million
bpd
of
export
capacity
would
be
added
from
a
pipeline
that
eventually
connects
the
southern
city
of
basra
with
jordan
s
red
sea
port
of
aqaba
he
said
adding
that
building
new
pipelines
aims
to
diversify
our
export
outlets
a
final
deal
is
expected
to
be
reached
with
energy
company
bp
to
boost
output
from
oilfields
around
kirkuk
ghadhban
said
i
have
met
their
representative
bp
yesterday
and
i
hope
very
soon
we
reach
an
arrangement
it
s
one
of
the
priorities
