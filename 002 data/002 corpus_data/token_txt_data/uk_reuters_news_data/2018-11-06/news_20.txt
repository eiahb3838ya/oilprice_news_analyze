column-u.s. natural gas prices surge on cold weather forecast: kemp
london
reuters
natural
gas
prices
have
jumped
to
their
highest
in
nine
months
as
forecast
cold
weather
across
much
of
the
country
has
reminded
traders
of
the
risks
posed
by
low
gas
inventories
going
into
winter
gas
stocks
have
fallen
well
below
the
range
since
the
summer
and
are
now
at
the
lowest
level
for
the
time
of
year
since
according
to
data
compiled
by
the
energy
information
administration
until
the
past
few
days
traders
appeared
unconcerned
about
low
inventories
because
output
is
growing
rapidly
and
the
development
of
el
nino
over
the
pacific
should
lead
to
a
warm
winter
over
the
northern
part
of
the
country
but
the
much
colder
than
normal
temperatures
forecast
across
much
of
the
united
states
in
the
next
fortnight
are
a
reminder
that
el
niño
is
not
the
only
influence
on
weather
and
heating
demand
even
if
the
coming
winter
proves
warmer
than
average
there
is
still
scope
for
extensive
and
extended
cold
periods
that
could
put
further
pressure
on
gas
stocks
natural
gas
futures
prices
for
gas
delivered
in
december
have
jumped
to
almost
per
million
british
thermal
units
from
just
on
and
just
on
higher
gas
prices
will
encourage
owners
of
power
generators
to
run
them
for
fewer
hours
in
the
next
few
weeks
to
conserve
scarce
gas
stocks
while
power
plants
are
likely
to
run
more
working
gas
stocks
in
underground
storage
were
reported
at
billion
cubic
feet
on
some
percent
lower
than
the
bcf
at
the
same

heating
demand
has
been
running
close
to
or
slightly
below
the
seasonal
average
so
far
during
the
current
heating
season
which
started
on
july
chartbook
but
the
forecasts
for
much
colder
than
normal
weather
over
the
next
two
weeks
will
push
cumulative
heating
demand
far
above
the
seasonal
norm
almost
the
entire
united
states
except
california
and
southern
florida
as
well
as
alaska
and
hawaii
will
experience
colder
than
normal
temperatures
in
the
middle
of
november
colder
than
normal
temperatures
are
expected
to
persist
over
much
of
the
country
through
at
least
the
next
two
weeks
according
to
the
government
s
climate
prediction
center
the
sudden
cold
contrasts
with
a
warmer
than
normal
outlook
for
much
of
the
country
especially
across
the
northern
states
and
midwest
over
a
and
horizon
the
seasonal
outlook
is
dominated
by
the
background
el
niño
conditions
but
does
not
mean
there
can
not
be
intense
cold
spells
which
will
stretch
gas
inventories
many
hedge
fund
managers
have
been
buying
futures
and
options
linked
to
natural
gas
prices
on
the
assumption
that
cold
spells
would
force
prices
at
least
temporarily
higher
hedge
funds
and
other

managers
were
net
buyers
of

held
more

one
the
most
lopsided

eight
years
the
last
three
weeks
have
seen
some
small
long
liquidation
and
even
short
selling
according
to
regulatory
data
but
the
hedge
fund
community
is
still
very
bullish
natural

for

british
thermal
units
in
late
september
have
surged
to
a
premium
of

the
remainder
of
the
heating
season
is
likely
to
see
more
such
spikes
as
spot

and
