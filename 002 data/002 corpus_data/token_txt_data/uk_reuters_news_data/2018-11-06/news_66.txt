hedge

managers
were
net
sellers
of

for
a
fifth
week
running
last
week
as
concerns
about
sanctions
on
iran
evaporated
and
investors
refocused
on
economic
worries
the
net
long

in
the
six
most
important
futures
and

contracts
was
cut
by
a
further
million
barrels
in

managers
have
been
net

of

since
the

of

taking
their

to
the
lowest
level
for
months
according
to

published
by

fund

still
favour
bullish

over
bearish
short
ones
by
a
ratio
of
almost
but
the
ratio
has
sunk
from
more
than
only
five
weeks
ago
the
hedge

community
s
bullish
bias
is
the
lowest
for
a
year
and
positioning
now
looks
far
less
stretched
than
it

growth
from

russia
saudi

the

and
kuwait
should
be
enough
to
compensate
for
the
loss
of
iranian

the

has
also
taken
a
more
flexible
approach
to
sanctions
backing
away
from
earlier
threats
to
cut
iranian
exports
to
zero
and
granting
waivers
to
many
of

in
