asian
shares
inched
up
on
tuesday
supported
by
wall
street
gains
although
momentum
was
tempered
ahead
of
the
midterm
elections
the
first
major
electoral
test
of
president
donald
trump
s
big
tax
cuts
and
hostile
trade
policies
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
edged
up
percent
on
a
positive
lead
from
wall
street
but
the
gains
were
capped
by
falls
in
chinese
markets
and
regional
technology
shares
japan
s
nikkei
average
climbed
percent
the
shanghai
composite
and
csi
eased
percent
and

respectively
both
mainland
benchmarks
were
able
to
claw
back
some
of
their
earlier
losses
however
on
news
that
china
s
leadership
was
open
to
dialogue
with
the
united
states
to
resolve
trade
shares
in
suppliers
of
apple
inc
such
as
taiwan
s
hon
hai
precision
industry
fell
after
a
report
in
the
nikkei
newspaper
that
apple
had
told
its
smartphone
assemblers
to
halt
plans
for
additional
production
lines
dedicated
to
the
iphone
xr
the
report
drove
apple
shares
percent
lower
in
trade
on
wall
street
the
s
p
gained
percent
with
financials
such
as
berkshire
hathaway
supported
by
strong
earnings
taking
the
lead
from
and
asian
peers
european
futures
pointed
to
a
higher
openings
with
financial
spreadbetters
showing
london
s
ftse
frankfurt
s
dax
and
paris
s
cac
expected
to
rise
between
and
percent
ahead
of
tuesday
s
midterm
elections
investors
generally
expect
opposition
democrats
to
take
over
the
house
of
representatives
while
trump
s
republican
party
is
tipped
to
retain
the
senate
while
political
gridlock
between
the
white
house
and
congress
could
hinder
trump
s
agenda
and
raise
concerns
about
political
instability
some
analysts
say
such
an
outcome
may
have
already
been
priced
in
by
investors
the
cboe
skew
index
also
known
as
the
black
swan
index
hovered
not
far
from
its
low
hit
friday
indicating
demand
for
options
that
provide
protection
remains
tepid
a
higher
skew
typically
indicates
investors
are
buying
more
protection
on
heightened
anxiety
unlike
the
presidential
election
or
the
s
brexit
referendum
the
upcoming
midterm
elections
are
not
a
binary
event
so
it
s
unlikely
to
send
stocks
significantly
in
one
direction
apart
from
initial
quick
reactions
said
yasuo
sakuma
chief
investment
officer
at
libra
investments
so
with
this
one
i
don
t
think
there
is
much
need
to
hedge
against
the
black
swan
if
the
republicans
retain
their
house
majority
global
stocks
are
likely
to
rally
on
hopes
of
more
tax
cuts
trump
said
last
month
his
administration
planned
to
produce
a
resolution
calling
for
a
percent
tax
cut
for
households
everyone
still
remembers
strong
equity
rallies
after
trump
was
elected
two
years
ago
so
initially
stock
markets
will
gain
said
norihiro
fujito
chief
investment
strategist
at
mitsubishi
ufj
morgan
stanley
securities
but
further
tax
cuts
would
boost
already
large
fiscal
deficits
and
push
the
treasuries
yield
above
its
october
high
almost
instantly
given
rises
in
bond
yields
triggered
a
correction
in
equities
last
month
any
rally
in
stocks
is
unlikely
to
last
long
he
added
the
treasuries
yield
stood
at
percent
maintaining
most
of
its
gains
following
friday
s
strong
jobs
and
wage
data
and
staying
not
far
from
its
peak
of
percent
hit
on
global
equities
have
recovered
after
their
fall
in
february
which
was
triggered
by
a
rise
in
yields
but
this
time
a
recovery
will
likely
be
capped
because
now
markets
do
not
have
the
support
they
had
back
in
february
from
tame
inflation
and
the
economic
boost
from
trump
s
tax
cuts
said
shuji
shirota
head
of
strategy
at
hsbc
in
tokyo
many
investors
also
expect
trump
to
continue
to
take
a
hard
line
on
trade
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
elections
the
impact
of
trade
war
will
start
to
appear
in
economic
data
in
coming
months
shirota
added
in
oil
markets
crude
prices
wobbled
near
lows
after
the
united
states
allowed
eight
countries
to
temporarily
continue
buying
