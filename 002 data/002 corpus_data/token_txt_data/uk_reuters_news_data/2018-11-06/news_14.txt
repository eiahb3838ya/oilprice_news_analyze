iraq
s
oil
minister
thamer
ghadhban
said
on
tuesday
that
the
shortfall
in
oil
supply
caused
by
new
sanctions
on
iran
had
yet
to
be
gauged
ahead
of
an
opec
meeting
next
month
ghadhban
said
iraq
wanted
to
see
the
actual
decrease
before
baghdad
and
other
members
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
decide
how
to
deal
with
a
reduction
in
iranian
shipments
i
want
to
wait
and
see
how
much
is
the
actual
physical
decrease
in
iranian
exports
and
whether
this
would
be
compensated
by
not
only
opec
producers
but
by
other
countries
he
told
reuters
in
his
first
interview
since
taking
over
the
oil
portfolio
last
month
what
will
be
the
physical
increase
in
demand
on
iraqi
oil
if
there
s
no
demand
how
can
i
say
we
ll
compensate
ghadhban
did
not
specify
what
oil
price
he
expected
for
he
said
a
price
above
per
barrel
was
fair
and
that
the
higher
the
price
the
better
it
was
for
iraq
i
compare
it
with
previous
prices
when
we
talk
about
prices
above
i
say
it
s
a
fair
price
it
s
not
or
and
it
s
not
in
principle
the
higher
the
price
the
better
for
iraq
but
we
re
not
working
alone
we
re
a
member
of
opec
we
see
the
interests
of
consumers
and
we
want
to
be
a
viable
producer
and
exporter
ghadhban
said
the
united
states
on
monday
restored
sanctions
targeting
iran
s
oil
banking
and
transport
sectors
and
threatened
more
action
to
stop
what
washington
called
its
outlaw
policies
steps
that
tehran
called
economic
warfare
and
vowed
to
defy
a
official
confirmed
iraq
had
been
granted
a
waiver
to
import
some
iranian
products
iraqi
officials
said
last
week
baghdad
would
still
be
allowed
to
import
crucial
gas
and
energy
supplies
for
its
power
stations
as
well
as
food
items
