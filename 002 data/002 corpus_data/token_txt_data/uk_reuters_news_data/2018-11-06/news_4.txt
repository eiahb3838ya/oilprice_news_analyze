nov
reuters
energy
regulators
gave
williams
cos
inc
two
more
years
until
december
to
get
the
approvals
needed
to
build
its
constitution
natural
gas
pipeline
from
pennsylvania
to
new
york
according
to
a
federal
filing
made
available
on
tuesday
before
it
can
start
building
the
project
williams
still
needs
water
quality
certification
new
york
state
denied
the
permit
in
saying
the
company
failed
to
provide
sufficient
information
to
determine
whether
the
project
would
comply
with
state
water
standards
williams
sued
in
federal
court
arguing
that
new
york
waived
its
authority
to
decide
on
the
certification
by
failing
to
act
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
the
case
went
all
the
way
to
the
supreme
court
which
declined
to
review
the
appeals
court
judgment
that
upheld
the
state
s
decision
the
company
has
filed
a
new
federal
lawsuit
this
is
the
second
extension
for
the
pipeline
which
has
been
bogged
down
in
regulatory
and
legal
battles
since
ferc
approved
construction
in
december
the
company
and
the
utilities
that
sell
gas
to
fuel
power
plants
and
heat
homes
favor
the
line
which
is
opposed
by
environmental
groups
local
landowners
and
new
york
governor
andrew
cuomo
who
argue
that
the
state
should
rely
more
on
energy
efficiency
and
renewables
if
built
the
pipeline
would
transport
billion
cubic
feet
per
day
bcfd
of
shale
gas
when
williams
proposed
constitution
in
it
estimated
the
project
would
cost
about
million
and
enter
service
in
delays
however
have
boosted
that
estimate
to
as
high
as
million
according
to
upstate
new
york
newspapers
williams
has
said
it
would
take
about
to
months
to
build
the
pipeline
after
it
receives
the
necessary
approvals
constitution
is
owned
by
subsidiaries
of
williams
cabot
oil
gas
duke
energy
and
altagas
ltd
in
addition
to
williams
court
appeal
there
is
another
possible
path
to
get
constitution
built
some
federal
officials
including
energy
secretary
rick
perry
have
said
the
federal
government
could
overturn
state
decisions
that
block
pipelines
for
national
security
reasons
president
donald
trump
is
unlikely
to
see
much
progress
on
his
policy
goals
from
a
divided
congress
we
expect
his
administration
will
on
regulatory
issues
like
constitution
to
eke
out
wins
ahead
of
his
campaign
