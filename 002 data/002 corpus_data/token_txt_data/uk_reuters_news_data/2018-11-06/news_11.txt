the
world
s
biggest
crop
nutrient
producer
by
capacity
is
looking
at
expanding
several
nitrogen
fertilizer
plants
in
north
america
due
to
rising
prices
chief
executive
chuck
magro
said
on
tuesday
nitrogen
prices
have
climbed
as
china
s
shutdown
of
plants
and
rising
european
costs
of
natural
gas
a
key
ingredient
in
fertilizer
production
have
curbed
capacity
outside
north
america
nutrien
is
looking
at
several
brownfields
in
our
network
primarily
in
north
america
but
it
s
too
early
to
talk
specifically
about
that
magro
said
on
a
quarterly
conference
call
using
the
industry
term
for
expanding
existing
plants
magro
said
prices
are
not
high
enough
to
justify
building
new
plants
and
that
high
north
american
labor
costs
add
risk
in
an
interview
magro
added
that
some
plant
expansions
may
be
very
minor
and
serve
to
adjust
the
mix
of
nitrogen
products
produced
he
said
opportunities
to
acquire
nitrogen
plants
from
other
companies
are
fully
priced
and
don
t
represent
ways
to
create
value
nitrogen
is
the
most
widely
used
fertilizer
to
accelerate
growth
of
crops
such
as
corn
prices
look
to
remain
high
around
per
tonne

the
port
of
new
orleans

wong

a
note
on
monday
prices
are
also
likely
to
increase
in
for
certain
crop
protection
products
that
are
imported
from
china

to
a

tariff
applied
to
chinese
products

mike

president
of
nutrien

retail
business
nutrien
reported
late
on
monday
a
quarterly
