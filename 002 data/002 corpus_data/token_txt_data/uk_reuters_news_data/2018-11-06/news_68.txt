vancouver
reuters
the
province
of
british
columbia
introduced
on
monday
new
environmental
assessment
rules
that
it
said
will
increase
clarity
and
certainty
for
the
companies
behind
projects
mirroring
efforts
by
the
canadian
government
to
update
major
project
reviews
the
proposed
changes
will
enhance
early
consultation
with
indigenous
groups
and
allow
good
projects
to
be
approved
more
quickly
british
columbia
s
environment
minister
george
heyman
said
in
a
statement
we
want
to
reduce
the
potential
for
the
types
of
legal
challenges
we
ve
too
frequently
seen
in
heyman
said
most
major
projects
in
british
columbia
must
undergo
an
environmental
assessment
often
done
in
partnership
with
a
federal
review
canada
s
ruling
liberals
introduced
draft
legislation
earlier
this
year
that
would
change
how
pipelines
mines
and
other
major
projects
are
assessed
seeking
to
address
unhappiness
over
the
potential
environmental
impact
of
those
developments
the
federal
move
has
been
criticized
by
political
opponents
and
some
in
industry
over
concerns
it
will
add
more
hurdles
without
resulting
in
increased
public
support
for
contentious
projects
like
crude
oil
pipelines
british
columbia
said
the
changes
to
its
process
will
give
the
province
the
ability
to
more
fully
assess
environmental
impacts
of
developments
including
upstream
emissions
and
social
cultural
and
health
effects
it
will
also
include
stronger
enforcement
including
audits
to
ensure
conditions
of
approval
are
being
followed
as
intended
the
new
rules
will
need
to
be
approved
by
the
province
s
legislative
assembly
