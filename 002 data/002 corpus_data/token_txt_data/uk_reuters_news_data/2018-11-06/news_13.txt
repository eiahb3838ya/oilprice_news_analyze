india
s
oil
imports
from
iran
in
could
be
higher
than
the
previous
year
despite
the
imposition
of
sanctions
a
reuters
analysis
of
industry
data
shows
forcing
the
government
to
rein
in
purchases
in
coming
months
india
s
oil
imports
from
iran
jumped
by
about
percent
in
from
a
year
earlier
totalling
bpd
or
million
tonnes
tanker
arrival
data
showed
the
sharp
increase
was
due
to
of
purchases
by
indian
refiners
ahead
of
renewed
sanctions
on
tehran
which
came
into
effect
on
monday
by
choking
iran
s
oil
and
shipping
industries
washington
aims
to
try
to
force
tehran
to
quash
its
nuclear
ambitions
and
ballistic
missile
programme
as
well
as
its
support
for
militant
proxies
in
the
middle
east
the
united
states
granted
exemptions
to
india
china
and
six
other
countries
allowing
them
to
temporarily
continue
buying
iranian
oil
but
those
waiver
carry
conditions
for
india
iran
s
no
oil
customer
the
waiver
allows
refiners
to
buy
only
up
to
million
tonnes
a
month
or
about
bpd
that
means
india
will
have
to
slash
its
monthly
purchases
from
iran
by
about
half
to
comply
with
the
waiver
analysts
still
expect
that
india
s
purchases
of
iranian
crude
in
the
full
fiscal
year
ending
in
march
will
exceed
the
bpd
or
million
tonnes
that
it
imported
in
the
previous
year
according
to
government
data
but
there
have
been
some
signs
of
a
in
demand
in
october
india
imported
about
bpd
of
iranian
oil
according
to
preliminary
tanker
arrival
data
obtained
from
sources
a
decline
of
percent
from
september
and
marginally
down
from
october
last
year
most
india
refiners
boosted
purchases
from
iran
ahead
of
the
sanctions
as
iran
was
offering
almost
free
shipping
and
extended
credit
periods
according
to
oil
analysts
refiners
also
wanted
to
offset
the
impact
of
rising
global
oil
prices
and
a
weak
indian
rupee
indian
refiners
imported
a
lot
from
iran
in
the
first
half
of
the
fiscal
year
mainly
due
to
the
discount
offered
by
iran
said
sri
paravaikkarasu
head
of
east
of
suez
oil
for
consultants
fge
in
singapore
she
said
new
delhi
could
even
ask
refiners
to
cut
imports
below
the
waiver
level
to
curry
favour
with
washington
last
year
india
s
imports
fell
as
refiners
had
curtailed
iranian
oil
purchases
due
to
a
dispute
with
tehran
over
development
rights
to
a
giant
gas
field
indian
refiners
that
control
about
percent
of
the
country
s
capacity
had
contracted
to
buy
bpd
of
iranian
oil
in
the
current
fiscal
year
but
with
new
sanctions
in
place
they
will
now
have
to
tell
iran
that
they
can
not
fulfil
those
agreements
