iran
s
oil
exports
have
fallen
sharply
since
president
donald
trump
said
at
he
would
sanctions
on
tehran
but
with
waivers
in
hand
the
middle
eastern
nation
s
major
buyers
could
scale
up
orders
as
soon
as
next
month
the
original
aim
of
the
sanctions
was
to
cut
iran
s
oil
exports
as
much
as
possible
to
quash
its
nuclear
and
ballistic
missile
programmes
and
curb
its
support
for
militant
proxies
particularly
in
syria
yemen
and
lebanon
but
the
exemptions
granted
to
iran
s
biggest
oil
clients
china
india
south
korea
japan
italy
greece
taiwan
and
turkey
which
allow
them
to
import
at
least
some
oil
for
another
days
could
mean
the
exports
start
to
rise
after
november
this
group
of
eight
buyers
takes
as
much
as
of
iran
s
seaborne
oil
exports
trade
data
shows
the
decision
by
the
to
grant
waivers
represents
a
departure
for
now
from
the
stated
aim
of
reducing
iran
s
oil
exports
to
zero
said
pat
thaker
regional
director
for
the
middle
east
and
africa
at
the
economist
intelligence
unit
as
a
result
of
pressure
by
washington
iran
s
oil
exports
in
november
may
not
exceed
million
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
according
to
industry
estimates
making
them
as
little
as
a
third
of
a
peak
sanctions
are
expected
to
bring
iranian
crude
exports
down
to
million
bpd
in
november
according
to

global

analytics
japan
s
trade
minister
hiroshige
seko
though
has
already
said
on
tuesday
that
japanese
buyers
of
iranian
oil
are
expected
to
resume
imports
from
the
islamic
republic
after
the
country
was
granted
a
waiver
from
sanctions
japan
and
south
korea
both
close
allies
had
toed
the
washington
sanctions
line
and
stopped
buying
crude
from
iran
india
iran
s
oil
customer
also
cut
orders
ahead
of
the
sanctions
hoping
its
effort
to
reduce
reliance
on
tehran
would
pay
off
in
washington
and
win
it
a
waiver
once
the
sanctions
even
china
locked
in
a
bitter
trade
war
with
the
united
states
bowed
to
pressure
from
washington
and
dialled
back
imports
trading
sources
said
several
asian
oil
importers
are
already
looking
to
increase
their
orders
for
iranian
oil
soon
enquiries
for
cargoes
from
iran
are
coming
in
from
several
asian
buyers
said
one
merchant
trader
who
declined
to
be
named
because
he
was
not
authorized
to
talk
about
his
firm
s
commercial
activity
the
exemptions
have
cut
fears
of
a
supply
shortage
taking
pressure
off
companies
governments
and
economies
around
the
world
that
have
struggled
with
the
surging
cost
for
fuel
president
trump
facing
crucial
midterm
elections
that
may
cost
republicans
control
of
the
congress
said
on
monday
he
wants
to
impose
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
gradually
citing
concerns
about
shocking
markets
and
causing
global
price
spikes
that
has
helped
to
take
the
sting
out
of
the
sanctions
threat
which
helped
to
lift
international
benchmark
brent
crude
futures
to
highs
of
almost
a
barrel
in
early
october
brent
prices
are
now
about
percent
lower
than
that
peak
and
have
barely
budged
over
the
last
two
sessions
now
it
will
be
key
to
watch
what
happens
after
the
exemptions
expire
in
days
the
merchant
trader
said
iran
s
oil
exports
rose
sharply
after
the
previous
round
of
sanctions
were
lifted
in
early
including
condensate
an
form
of
crude
shipments
peaked
around
million
bpd
