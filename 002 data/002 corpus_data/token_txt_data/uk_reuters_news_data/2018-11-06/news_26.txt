exporting
countries
decide
how
to

shipments
i
want
to
wait
and
see
how
much
is
the
actual
physical
decrease
in
iranian

and
whether
this
would
be
compensated
by
not

opec
producers
but
by
other
countries

s
no
demand
how
can
i
say
we
ll
compensate

a

was
fair
and
that
the
higher
the
price
the
better
it
was
for
