china
s
shandong
province
home
to
a
fifth
of
china
s
oil
refining
capacity
is
planning
to
consolidate
dozens
of
small
refineries
and
build
complexes
as
part
of
a
new
plan
to
overhaul
energy
intensive
industries
the
plan
published
on
monday
is
aimed
at
improving
the
efficiency
and
competitiveness
in
seven
sectors
including
steel
fertilizer
aluminium
coking
coal
and
oil
refining
it
comes
amid
an
ongoing
push
by
beijing
to
tackle
excess
capacity
in
heavy
industry
and
shift
its
economy
to
higher
sectors
and
improve
its
dirty
air
we
will
cap
capacity
of
steel
petrochemicals
coking
coal
and
aluminium
and
achieve
a
drop
in
energy
intensity
as
well
as
total
emissions
from
these
sectors
the
shandong
government
said
in
the
document
published
on
its
website
the
province
home
to
percent
of
china
s
private
refiners
wants
to
reduce
total
crude
processing
capacity
from
million
tonnes
per
year
or
million
barrels
of
oil
per
day
bpd
to
million
tonnes
it
will
merge
refiners
with
less
than
million
tonnes
annual
capacity
by
and
later
target
those
with
up
to
million
tonnes
or
about
bpd
before
it
also
wants
to
significantly
reduce
the
output
of
diesel
and
gasoline
by
the
move
is
seen
as
positive
for
china
s
independent
refining
industry
currently
facing
fierce
competition
in
local
fuel
markets
and
subject
to
frequent
shutdowns
due
to
environmental
scrutiny
the
small
private
refiners
known
as
teapots
have
a
small
share
in
domestic
petrochemical
markets
which
are
dominated
by
state
companies
such
as
sinopec
and
foreign
majors
like
exxon
mobil
shandong
is
being
forced
to
reshuffle
its
oil
industry
under
pressure
from
companies
and
foreign
oil
majors
said
zhong
jian
chief
analyst
with
consultancy
jlc
shandong
said
it
will
lobby
for
policy
support
from
beijing
including
seeking
approvals
for
new
mega
refining
complexes
and
getting
crude
oil
import
quotas
for
new
refineries
in
the
future
the
province
wants
to
build
huge
refining
complexes
with
million
tonnes
of
yearly
processing
capacity
and
shift
production
to
chemicals
products
the
document
also
outlined
plans
for
other
sectors
such
as
capping
annual
fertilizer
output
at
million
tonnes
and
reducing
the
number
of
coking
coal
producers
from
to
in
two
years
it
also
said
percent
of
steel
mills
built
in
polluted
cities
such
as
jinan
zibo
and
binzhou
will
be
forced
to
relocate
to
coastal
areas
the
province
said
it
would
give
incentives
such
as
tax
breaks
and
credit
lines
to
help
companies
relocate
and
compensate
workers
made
redundant
during
the
relocation
process
