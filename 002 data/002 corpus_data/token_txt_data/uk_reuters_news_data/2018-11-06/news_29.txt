tullow
oil
expects
the
first
crude
shipments
from
its
kenyan
oilfields
in
the
first
half
of
and
is
pricing
the
product
for
the
market
the
company
s
chief
executive
said
on
tuesday
paul
mcdade
also
told
reuters
that
tullow
which
has
expanded
beyond
africa
to
the
coast
of
guyana
was
bringing
forward
its
drilling
plans
for
the
south
american
country
and
was
looking
to
drill
at
least
two
wells
there
in
the
middle
of
in
kenya
one
of
africa
s
newest
oil
plays
where
tullow
is
already
trucking
crude
the
next
phase
is
getting
ready
to
roll
we
will
have
a
shipment
of
kenyan
crude
ready
to
go
probably
in
the
first
or
second
quarter
of
next
year
we
will
market
that
and
it
allows
the
refiners
to
see
the
crude
and
try
the
crude
so
that
helps
the
marketing
process
mcdade
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
the
africa
oil
week
conference
the
price
for
crude
from
kenya
and
neighbouring
uganda
has
not
yet
been
fixed
the
product
is
light
crude
but
is
waxy
a
drawback
as
it
needs
to
be
heated
for
transport
to
stay
liquid
but
its
extremely
low
sulphur
content
is
a
plus
a
percent
sulphur
limit
will
be
imposed
on
marine
fuels
from
by
the
international
maritime
organization
down
from
percent
to
help
protect
the
ocean
environment
it
is
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
zero
sulphur
which
is
quite
unusual
that
will
give
it
a
premium
mcdade
said
he
would
not
be
drawn
on
what
he
thought
its
price
ultimately
would
be
in
relation
to
the
brent
benchmark
tullow
also
has
a
planned
pipeline
project
in
kenya
and
its
ceo
said
tenders
would
go
out
for
that
probably
in
the
first
half
of
next
year
some
of
the
contractors
tullow
has
spoken
to
have
said
they
can
get
their
own
financing
that
is
a
novelty
it
s
not
the
conventional
way
to
go
mcdade
said
meanwhile
in
guyana
tullow
has
accelerated
drilling
plans
in
its
concessions
we
had
originally
thought
we
would
drill
some
of
those
wells
late
next
year
but
we
have
now
accelerated
and
will
probably
drill
at
least
two
wells
in
our
block
around
the
middle
of
the
year
