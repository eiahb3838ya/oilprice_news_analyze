treasury

has
been

the
congressional
elections
mark
the
first
major
test
of
president
donald
trump
s
polarizing
personality
and
hardline
policies
on
taxes
trade
and
immigration
if
his
republican
party
loses
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
or
the
senate
democrats
would
be
able
to
put
the
brakes
on
his
agenda
opinion
polls
show
democrats
have
a
good
chance
of
winning
a
majority
in
the
house
unlike
the
presidential
election
or
the
uk
s
brexit
referendum
the
upcoming
elections
are
not
a
binary
event
said
yasuo
sakuma
chief
investment
officer
at

investments
so
it
s
unlikely
to
send
stocks
significantly
in
one
direction
apart
from
initial
quick

on
disappointing
corporate
earnings
and
caution
ahead
of
the

results

added

with
the
democrats
favourites
to
take
control
of
the
house
and
the
republicans
the
senate
the
next
couple
of
years
may
be
far
more
difficult
for
trump
said
craig
erlam
a
senior
market
analyst
at
oanda
in
london
when
you
consider
how
markets
have
done
since
his
election
victory
granted
primarily
on
the
back
of
tax
reforms
it
s
easy
to
see
why
this
may
not
be
the
most
the
benchmark
s
p
index
has
climbed
percent
since
trump
s
election
in
november
more
than
under
any
other
president
in
comparable
periods
in
the
past
years
with
so
much
at
stake
currency
market
moves
were
tight
the
dollar
hardly
moved
against
the
euro
and
gained
some
ground
against
the
japanese
yen
sterling
reversed
earlier
losses
in
volatile
trading
on
growing
hopes
of
a
brexit
deal
breakthrough
after
a
british
cabinet
meeting
the
dollar
index
which
tracks
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
was
flat
with
the
euro
up
percent
to
the
yen
weakened
percent
versus
the
greenback
at
per
dollar
italian
shares
were
essentially
flat
despite
frayed
nerves
in
italy
after
euro
zone
finance
ministers
called
on
rome
to
change
its
budget
to
conform
with
european
union
rules
at
a
meeting
late
on
monday
oil
prices
sank
with
crude
futures
sliding
to
an
low
as
iran
said
it
had
so
far
been
able
to
sell
as
much
oil
as
it
needed
to
after
washington
granted
sanction
waivers
to
top
buyers
of
iranian
oil
crude
fell
percent
to
per
barrel
and
brent
was
last
at

on
the

the
details
on
the
iran
sanctions
waivers
are
trickling
out

it
appears
much
more

will
remain

previously
thought
said
john
kilduff
a
partner
