iraq
s
parliament
approved
a
budget
on
saturday
the
first
since
declaring
victory
over
islamic
state
after
three
years
of
war
but
kurdish
lawmakers
boycotted
the
vote
over
their
region
s
diminished
allocation
the
budget
of
trillion
iraqi
dinars
billion
is
based
on
projected
oil
exports
of
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
at
a
price
of
a
copy
of
the
final
bill
showed
it
envisions
government
revenues
of
trillion
dinars
billion
with
a
deficit
of
trillion
dinars
billion
parliament
was
meant
to
pass
the
budget
before
the
start
of
the
financial
year
in
january
but
all
three
main
blocs
shi
ite
arabs
sunni
arabs
and
kurds
had
serious
issues
with
the
government
s
proposal
we
boycotted
the
vote
and
there
are
proposals
for
kurdistan
to
withdraw
from
the
entire
political
process
in
iraq
over
the
unfair
treatment
we
have
received
said
kurdish
mp
ashwaq
jaff
the
budget
cut
the
kurdistan
regional
government
s
krg
share
from
the
percent
the
region
has
traditionally
received
since
the
fall
of
saddam
hussein
it
did
not
specify
a
percentage
to
be
allocated
to
the
krg
instead
stipulating
it
would
receive
funds
proportional
to
its
share
of
the
population
in
a
previous
draft
the
krg
portion
was
set
at
percent
which
is
how
much
of
iraq
s
population
baghdad
says
the
provinces
in
kurdistan
make
up
the
krg
disputes
that
estimation
the
kurds
overwhelmingly
voted
to
secede
in
an
independence
referendum
in
september
which
was
opposed
by
baghdad
in
october
iraqi
forces
retook
disputed
territories
including
the
oil
city
of
kirkuk
that
had
came
under
kurdish
control
in
and
baghdad
imposed
sanctions
on
the
krg
such
as
suspending
international
flights
from
kurdish
airports
baghdad
and
the
krg
had
been
engaged
in
talks
for
months
about
the
sanctions
and
kurdistan
s
share
of
the
budget
the
government
said
on
tuesday
it
had
reached
an
agreement
with
the
kurds
to
resume
kirkuk
oil
exports
through
turkey
s
ceyhan
port
but
gave
no
precise
timeline
the
projected
million
bpd
exports
in
the
budget
includes
a
bpd
contribution
from
the
kurdistan
region
lawmakers
said
on
saturday
it
was
not
immediately
clear
what
effect
the
kurdish
boycott
of
the
vote
would
have
on
that
shi
ite
lawmakers
wanted
more
spending
allocated
to
the
southern
predominantly
shi
ite
provinces
as
well
as
greater
salaries
and
benefits
for
the
shi
ite
militias
known
as
popular
mobilisation
forces
who
helped
iraq
s
security
forces
defeat
islamic
state
sunni
lawmakers
wanted
more
allocated
towards
reconstructing
areas
retaken
from
the
militants
which
were
predominantly
sunni
the
areas
include
iraq
s
second
city
mosul
on
thursday
the
three
presidencies
of
iraq
its
shi
ite
prime
minister
sunni
parliament
speaker
and
kurdish
president
had
met
to
discuss
how
to
push
the
budget
through
prime
minister
haider
congratulated
iraqis
over
the
passing
of
the
budget
on
saturday
and
said
it
was
the
result
of
cooperation
between
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
speaker
salim
said
the
budget
addressed
kurdish
concerns
and
that
the
federal
government
would
pay
the
salaries
of
kurdish
civil
servants
and
peshmerga
fighters
as
well
as
welfare
entitlements
baghdad
had
stopped
paying
salaries
or
making
budget
transfers
to
the
kurdish
regional
capital
erbil
in
when
the
kurds
started
independently
selling
oil
oil
exports
iraq
s
main
source
of
revenue
have
risen
above
million
barrels
per
day
this
year
but
a
global
slump
in
prices
for
crude
compounded
by
the
costs
of
rebuilding
an
infrastructure
damaged
by
the
war
against
islamic
state
have
battered
