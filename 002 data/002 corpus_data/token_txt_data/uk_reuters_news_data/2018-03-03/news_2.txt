struggling

and
which
the

to
ensure
gas
transit
to
european
customers
ukrtransgaz
spokesman
ihor
kravchyshyn
said
it

system
at
a
low
level
at
least
percent
below
that
required
by

ukrainian
president
petro
poroshenko
said
on
saturday
ukraine
saw

which
has
fully
offset
the

decision
gazprom
had

for

first
time
since
late
when
kiev
started
buying

from
europe
to
try
to
cut
its
energy
dependence
on
moscow
but
the
russian
group
cancelled
that
plan
