the
canadian
government
said
on
tuesday
that
it
would
spend
c
billion
billion
mostly
through
loans
to
assist
the
country
s
oil
and
gas
industry
which
has
struggled
to
move
energy
to
markets
due
to
full
pipelines
natural
resources
minister
amarjeet
sohi
said
in
edmonton
alberta
that
the
aid
package
would
include
c
billion
for
energy
exporters
to
invest
in
new
technologies
boost
working
capital
or
find
new
markets
canada
is
producing
a
record
million
barrels
of
oil
per
day
this
month
according
to
national
energy
board
estimates
but
pipeline
capacity
has
not
expanded
as
quickly
to
move
crude
to
refineries
the
bottlenecks
have
resulted
in
steep
price
discounts
the
federal
aid
package
also
includes
c
million
in
commercial
financing
spread
over
three
years
to
help
oil
and
gas
companies
weather
current
market
conditions
sohi
said
another
c
million
will
go
toward
energy
projects
through
an
innovation
fund
and
c
million
will
fund
projects
that
involve
reducing
environmental
damage
from
resource
extraction
the
funds
will
stabilize
struggling
oil
companies
but
they
really
need
greater
access
to
markets
said
mark
scholz
president
of
the
canadian
association
of
oilwell
drilling
contractors
the
struggles
of
the
oil
sector
concentrated
in
the
western
province
of
alberta
have
generated
rallies
in
the
past
month
demanding
that
ottawa
do
more
to
help
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
s
liberal
government
bought
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
in
the
summer
with
plans
to
expand
it
but
a
canadian
court
quashed
government
approval
of
the
project
this
month
alberta
premier
rachel
notley
took
the
rare
step
of
ordering
oil
curtailments
amounting
to
barrels
per
day
starting
in
january
to
reduce
the
province
s
glut
small
oil
producers
will
benefit
from
ottawa
s
support
package
although
it
is
cut
and
paste
from
federal
aid
for
other
sectors
notley
told
reporters
in
calgary
it
s
a
start
but
offering
alberta
industry
the
opportunity
to
go
further
in
debt
is
not
any
kind
of
both
trudeau
and
notley
face
elections
next
year
and
the
oil
industry
s
problems
pose
a
political
liability
the
canadian
economy
is
projected
to
grow
by
percent
next
year
more
slowly
than
this
year
s
percent
pace
partly
due
to
weak
energy
investment
