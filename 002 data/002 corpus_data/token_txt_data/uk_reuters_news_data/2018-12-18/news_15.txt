solar system's most distant object is 'farout' pink dwarf planet
washington
reuters
scientists
have
discovered
the
most
distant
object
known
in
our
solar
system
so
remote
and
unusual
they
chose
the
nickname
farout
for
the
icy
pinkish
dwarf
planet
about
to
times
further
from
the
sun
than
earth
astronomer
scott
sheppard
of
the
carnegie
institution
for
science
in
washington
said
on
tuesday
the
dwarf
planet
officially
designated
as
is
estimated
to
have
a
diameter
of
to
miles
to
km
there
are
roughly
dwarf
planets
in
the
solar
system
the
biggest
are
pluto
with
a
diameter
of
about
miles
km
and
eris
with
a
diameter
of
about
miles
km
when
i
saw
the
object
for
the
first
time
it
was
moving
so
slowly
it
was
the
slowest
thing
i
ve
ever
seen
so
i
kind
of
muttered
to
myself
far
out
kind
of
like
that
s
but
it
s
also
a
object
in
distance
so
that
s
why
i
went
with
calling
it
farout
sheppard
said
its
discovery
was
announced
on
monday
by
the
international
astronomical
union
s
minor
planet
center
we
don
t
know
too
much
about
it
sheppard
added
we
only
detected
it
last
month
from
its
brightness
we
can
determine
its
size
we
know
its
color
it
has
a
pinkish
reddish
hue
to
it
if
you
put
ices
out
there
and
you
irradiate
them
from
the
solar
radiation
over
time
ices
turn
kind
of
a
reddish
pinkish
color
so
we
think
its
surface
is
probably
sheppard
and
other
scientists
spotted
farout
during
their
search
for
extremely
distant
solar
system
objects
including
a
potential
planet
x
that
he
said
could
be
five
to
times
the
size
of
earth
in
these
researchers
proposed
the
existence
of
a
ninth
major
planet
at
the
outer
reaches
of
the
solar
system
they
said
farout
is
moving
so
slowly
that
it
might
need
more
than
years
for
a
single
orbit
of
the
sun
the
observed
solar
system
object
is
eris
which
orbits
at
about
times
the
distance
of
the
sun
to
the
earth
pluto
orbits
at
about
times
the
distance
of
earth
from
the
sun
