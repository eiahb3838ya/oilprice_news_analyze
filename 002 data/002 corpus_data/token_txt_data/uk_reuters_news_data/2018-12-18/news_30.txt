homebuilder
sentiment
had
fallen

it
was
the
second
consecutive
month
of
disappointing
reading
the
gloomy
data
came
after
weak
economic
news
from
china
and
europe

the
federal
reserve
is
widely
expected
to
raise
interest
rates
on
wednesday
which
would
be
its
fourth
hike
this
year
but
many
investors
now
expect
signs
of
economic
turbulence
to
prompt
the
fed
to
signal
a
slowdown
in
the
pace
of
tightening
next
year
on
monday
president
donald
trump
and
his
top
trade
adviser
ratcheted
up
their
criticism
of
the
central
bank
s
monetary
tightening
it
is
incredible
that
with
a
very
strong
dollar
and
virtually
no
inflation
the
outside
world
blowing
up
around
us
paris
is
burning
and
china
way
down
the
fed
is
even
considering
yet
another
interest
rate
hike
take
the
victory
trump
wrote
in
a
tweet
white
house
trade
adviser
peter
navarro
amplified
those
remarks
a
few
hours
later
calling
the
fed
crazy
for
having
signalled
that
it
would
continue
to
raise
rates
next
year
the
fed
said
in
september
that
its
policymakers
see
three
more
rate
hikes
in
while
money
market
futures
are
pricing
in
less
than
one
such
move
the
major
event
between
now
and
the
end
of
the
year
is
going
to
be
what
the
fed
does
tomorrow
said
jim
mccafferty
hong
head
of
equity
research
at
nomura
given
the
pace
of
change
of
sentiment
seen
from
not
just
companies
but
also
from
major
i
think
there
might
be
an
outside
chance
that
the
fed
gives
a
more
muted
message
in
terms
of
growth
and
how
aggressive
it
will
be
in
terms
of
future
rate
hikes
he
added
the
spectre
of
a
dovish
