global
coal
demand
will
edge
higher
until
as
growth
in
india

other
asian
countries
offsets
a
decline
in
europe
and
the
united
states
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
on
tuesday
consumption
of
the
fuel
is
expected
to
rise
by
an
average

from
million
tonnes
of
coal
equivalent
mtce

the
report
comes
days

climate
deal
aimed
at
curbing
emissions
from
fossil

despite
significant

attention
being
given

and
moves

market
trends
are
proving
resistant
to
change
the
report
said
coal

the
global
source
of
primary
energy
behind
oil
and
the
largest
source
of
electricity
for
the
world
to
meet
its
climate
goals
more
work
is
needed
to
develop
carbon
capture
storage
and
use
ccsu
technology
which
captures
and
then
either
stores
carbon
dioxide
underground
or
uses
it
in
other
industries

goals
there
can
be
no
future
for
coal
without

just
carbon
capture
and
storage
plants
are
in
operation
around

coal

pollution
a
sharp
increase
is
predicted
for
india
with
demand
rising
by
mtce
