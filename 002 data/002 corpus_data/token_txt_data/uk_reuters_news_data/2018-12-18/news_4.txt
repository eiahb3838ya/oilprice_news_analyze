the
north
american
electric
reliability
corp
nerc
the
watchdog
for
the
electricity
grid
said
on
tuesday
that
new
pipelines
and
power
lines
would
be
required
to
meet
power
demands
if
there
are
retirements
of
coal
and
nuclear
power
plants
retirements
would
likely
create
the
need
for
electric
and
natural
gas
infrastructure
expedited
buildout
of
new
generation
and
increased
use
of
resources
nerc
said
in
a
report
the
shift
to
natural
gas
generation
could
leave
the
bulk
power
system
vulnerable
to
fuel
delivery
risks
in
areas
where
pipeline
service
does
not
exist
the
report
said
president
donald
trump
has
been
advocating
for
steps
to
stem
a
surge
in
coal
and
nuclear
plant
retirements
in
recent
years
arguing
that
more
shutdowns
would
leave
the
country
less
able
to
bounce
back
from
disruptions
caused
by
storms
physical
attacks
and
hackers
the
report
could
help
the
trump
administration
to
justify
subsidizing
the
continued
operation
of
coal
and
nuclear
power
plants
which
are
being
hurt
by
low
natural
gas
prices
and
the
growing
use
of
renewables
to
produce
power
though
critics
said
it
mostly
looked
at
extreme
scenarios
of
shutdowns
