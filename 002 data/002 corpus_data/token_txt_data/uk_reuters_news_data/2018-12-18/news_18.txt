volkswagen

have
to
step
up
its
plans
for
mass
production
of
electric
vehicles
in
order
to
meet
european
targets
to
cut
greenhouse
emissions
from
cars
its
chief
executive
said
on
tuesday
the
remarks
came
after
the
european
union
agreed
on
monday
to
cut
emissions
from
cars
by
percent
by
and
follow
warnings
from
germany
home
to
the
bloc
s
biggest
automotive
industry
that
tough
targets
could
cost
jobs
and
harm
the
sector
this
is
more
than
the
percent
volkswagen
vw
still
reeling
from
an
emissions
cheating
scandal
expected
and
would
translate
into
a
share
for
electric
vehicles
of
more
than
percent
of
its
expected
total
vehicle
sales
in
ceo
herbert
diess
said
this
means
that
our
planned
restructuring
programme
which
is
needed
to
address
this
systemic
change
is
not
yet
german

minister
peter
altmaier
said
the
targets
were
at
the
limit
of
what
was
technically
and
economically
feasible
around
industrial
jobs
in
germany
are
tied
to
building
petrol
and
diesel
engined
vehicles
this
is
a
tough
stretch
and
is
at
the
higher
end
of
expectations
however
we
are
convinced
that
this
will
help
the
industry
to
finally
accept
that
combustion
engines
and
platforms
need
to
be
standardized
