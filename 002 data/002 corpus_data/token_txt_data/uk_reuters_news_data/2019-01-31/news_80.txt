dropped

the
lowest
volume
in

china
india
japan
and
south
korea
imported
a
total
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
down
percent
from
the
previous
year
data
from
the
countries
showed
that
was
the
lowest
since
about
million
bpd
in
when
a
previous
round
of
sanctions
on
iran
led
to
a
sharp
drop
in
asian
imports
reuters
data
showed
the
united
states
reimposed
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
exports
last
november
as
it
wants
to
negotiate
a
new
nuclear
deal
with
the
country
officials
have
said
they
intend
to
reduce
the
islamic
republic
s
oil
exports
to
zero
on
a
monthly
basis
asia
s
imports
from
iran
rebounded
to
a
high
of
bpd
in
december
as
china
and
india
stepped
up
purchases
after
washington
granted
eight
countries
waivers
from
the
iranian
sanctions
for
days
from
the
start
of
november
we
expect
iranian
exports
to
asia
to
remain
stable
at
around
barrels
per
day
until
may
when
the
waivers
expire
said
energy
aspects
analyst
riccardo
fabiani
in
december
china
s
imports
climbed
above
bpd
for
the
first
time
in
three
months
while
india
s
imports
rose
above
bpd
japan
and
south
korea
did
not
import
any
iranian
crude
that
month
because
they
were
still
sorting
out
payment
and
shipping
issues
but
the
countries
have
resumed
oil
lifting
from
iran
this
month
during
the
period
china
can
import
up
to
bpd
of
iranian
oil
while
india
s
imports
are
restricted
to
bpd
south
korea
can
import
up
to
bpd
of
iranian
condensate
after
may
it
will
all
depend
on
the
administration
s
decisions
which
at
the
moment
remain
completely
obscure
on
balance
they
are
likely
to
extend
the
current
waivers
although
rumours
are
that
there
could
be
a
significant
cut
in
waivered
volumes
fabiani
said
as
a
precaution
indian
oil
corp
the
country
s
top
refiner
is
looking
for
an
annual
deal
to
buy
crude
as
it
seeks
to
broaden
its
oil
purchasing
options
