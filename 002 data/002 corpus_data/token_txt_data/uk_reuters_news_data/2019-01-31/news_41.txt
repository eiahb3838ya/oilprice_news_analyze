npower
said
on
thursday
it
will
cut
roles
in
britain
this
year
as
part
of
a
programme
to
reduce
operating
costs
in
the
face
of
tough
retail
energy
market
conditions
the
uk
energy
supplier
said
the
proposed
reductions
will
be
out
of
its
current
workforce
although
as
around
this
number
of
people
leave
the
company
each
year
the
actual
number
of
redundancies
will
be
considerably

tough

itself
forecasts
that
five
of
the
big
six
energy
companies
will
make
a
loss
or
less
than
normal
profits
this
year
due
to
the
implementation
of
the
price
cap
and
with
several
recent
failures
of
new
energy
suppliers
it
is
clear
that
many
have
been
pricing
at
levels
that
are
not
sustainable
