wrapup 8-don't deal in venezuelan gold, white house says, in anti-maduro push
reuters
the
white
house
warned
traders
on
wednesday
not
to
deal
in
venezuelan
gold
or
oil
following
its
imposition
of
stiff
sanctions
aimed
at
forcing
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
from
power
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
tweeted
that
traders
should
not
deal
in
gold
oil
or
other
commodities
being
stolen
from
the
venezuelan
people
as
opponents
of
maduro
s
government
worried
that
a
plane
had
shipped
gold
out
of
caracas
on
wednesday
afternoon
the
white
house
said
president
donald
trump
spoke
to
venezuela
s
interim
president
juan
guaido
by
phone
on
wednesday
reiterating
support
for
his
fight
to
regain
on
one
side
of
the
tussle
for
control
of
venezuela
an
opec
member
that
has
the
world
s
largest
oil
reserves
but
is
in
dire
financial
straits
guaido
and
western
backers
led
by
the
united
states
are
insisting
on
an
immediate
transition
and
fresh
elections
on
the
other
maduro
with
backing
from
russia
china
and
turkey
says
he
will
remain
for
his
second
term
despite
accusations
of
fraud
in
his
last
year
and
the
economic
meltdown
venezuela
s
struggle
to
pay
its
debts
even
to
allies
russia
and
china
amid
a
sharp
drop
in
oil
output
has
been
exacerbated
by
the
new
sanctions
which
will
make
it
very
hard
to
sell
oil
to
its
main
client
the
united
states
in
that
context
the
arrival
in
caracas
of
a
boeing
plane
from
moscow
on
monday
led
to
speculation
maduro
s
government
was
shipping
more
gold
reserves
out
of
the
country
following
shipments
of
million
of
gold
to
turkey
last
year
that
was
part
of
a
strategy
to
increase
the
central
bank
s
liquidity
the
flight
operated
by
russia
s
nordwind
airlines
left
venezuela
at
pm
local
time
gmt
a
reuters
witness
said
another
flight
a
boeing
cargo
plane
arrived
at
the
airport
an
hour
earlier
via
cape
verde
according
to
flight
data
there
are
no
routine
flights
between
the
two
countries
venezuelan
lawmaker
jose
guerra
a
former
central
bank
economist
told
the
national
assembly
his
understanding
was
that
the
nordwind
plane
would
take
some
gold
reserves
to
russia
the
bank
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
sources

elliott
abrams
the

for

said
washington
was
looking
around
the
world
for
more
assets
of
the
maduro
government
including
gold
holdings
and
bank
accounts
the
kremlin
said
this
week
it
expected
venezuela
to
pay
its
debts
russia
which
like
china
has
loaned
and
invested
billions
of
dollars
to
opec
member
venezuela
called
on
guaido
to
drop
his
demand
for
a
snap
election
and
instead
accept
mediation
but
given
the
failure
of
previous
rounds
of
dialogue
between
the
government
and
opposition
including
one
led
by
the
vatican
opponents
are
suspicious
believing
maduro
uses
them
to
quell
protests
and
buy
time
guaido
s
envoy
to
the
united
states
carlos
vecchio
said
the
only
dialogue
they
were
interested
in
would
be
a
negotiation
for
maduro
s
departure
and
new
elections
government
officials
insist
the
next
presidential
election
will

one
went

another
