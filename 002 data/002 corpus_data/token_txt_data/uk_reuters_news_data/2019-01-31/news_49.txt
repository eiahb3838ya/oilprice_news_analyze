iran
said
on
thursday
a
new
european
mechanism
to
facilitate
trade
with
the
country
was
a
first
step
for
the
european
union
to
fulfil
its
commitments
under
a
nuclear
deal
between
tehran
and
major
powers
state
television
reported
france
germany
and
britain
have
set
up
the
mechanism
in
an
effort
to
circumvent
sanctions
on
iran
though
diplomats
say
it
is
unlikely
to
yield
the
big
commercial
transactions
that
tehran
says
it
needs
to
keep
the
nuclear
deal
afloat
it
is
a
first
step
taken
by
the
european
side
we
hope
it
will
cover
all
goods
and
items
