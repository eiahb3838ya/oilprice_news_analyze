some
refiners
have
begun
reducing
crude
processing
as
crude
oil
costs
have
risen
following
sanctions
on
venezuela
and
as
gasoline
margins
crashed
to
their
lowest
in
nearly
a
decade
market
sources
said
on
thursday
venezuela
ships
about
barrels
of
crude
oil
to
the
united
states
daily
which
refiners
use
to
produce
gasoline
and
diesel
but
sanctions
announced
on
monday
by
washington
aimed
at
driving
president
nicolas
maduro
out
of
power
after
his
contested
last
year
are
expected
to
cut
off
or
dramatically
reduce
those
shipments
many
refineries
particularly
those
in
the
gulf
coast
are
designed
to
run
heavier
grades
of
crude
a
good
portion
of
which
comes
from
venezuela
however
supplies
of
heavy
crude
in
the
americas
are
shrinking
due
to
the
sanctions
on
venezuela
low
production
in
mexico
and
bottlenecked
pipelines
in
canada
refiners
have
been
trying
to
offset
this
in
recent
days
by
buying
domestic
heavy
and
sour
crude
grades
those
barrels
have
gotten
more
expensive
however
because
of
the
higher
demand
refiners
have
the
capacity
to
shift
the
type
of
crude
they
process
but
light
crude
commonly
produced
in
texas
tends
to
refine
into
additional
barrels
of
gasoline
for
which
margins
have
slumped
gasoline
margins
sank
to
as
little
as
a
barrel
on
thursday
the
lowest
since
november
and
the
weakest
seasonally
since
at
least
as
a
domestic
glut
has
weighed
on
pump
prices
the
reduction
in
rates
are
mostly
at
gulf
coast
plants
but
some
on
the
east
coast
are
also
affected
market
sources
said
it
s
certainly
a
combination
of
both
factors
said
one
source
at
a
east
coast
refinery
where
rates
are
being
cut
the
extent
of
the
decline
in
crude
runs
was
not
immediately
clear
top
refiner
valero
energy
corp
said
it
has
stopped
taking
venezuelan
crude
and
is
looking
to
maximize
the
amount
of
light
crude
barrels
it
can
use
running
higher
amounts
of
light
crude
in
refinery
units
designed
to
break
down
heavy
oil
could
pose
operational
difficulties
by
producing
too
much
gasoline
and
related
fuels
forcing
complex
refiners
to
throttle
back
production
traders
and
refining
consultants
told
reuters
a
company
spokeswoman
declined
to
comment
on
crude
processing
rates
refinery
maintenance
season
should
help
offset
some
of
the
impact
of
shortages
in
heavy
crude
supplies
sources
said
valero
for
example
is
performing
overhauls
on
the
crude
distillation
and
coker
units
at
the
charles
louisiana
refinery
one
of
its
two
plants
that
routinely
process
venezuelan
crude
this
minimizes
the
impact
of
the
sanctions
said
senior
vice
president
gary
simmons
in
a
conference
call
with
wall
street
analysts
one
source
at
a
large
gulf
coast
refinery
said
locking
in
prices
for
canadian
heavy
crude
in
advance
has
helped
shield
the
company
from
the
impact
of
higher
heavy
crude
costs
