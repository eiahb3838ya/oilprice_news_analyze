update 1-opec oil output drops on saudi cut, outages and sanctions
london
reuters
opec
oil
supply
has
fallen
in
january
by
the
largest
amount
in
two
years
a
reuters
survey
found
as
saudi
arabia
and
its
gulf
allies
on
the
group
s
pact
while
iran
libya
and
venezuela
registered
involuntary
declines
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
has
pumped
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
this
month
the
survey
showed
on
thursday
down
bpd
from
december
and
the
largest
drop
since
january
the
survey
suggests
opec
is
almost
three
quarters
of
the
way
in
delivering
supply
cuts
that
started
on
in
an
effort
to
avert
a
glut
even
though
the
group
s
producer
iraq
and
some
smaller
members
pumped
above
agreed
levels
an
opec
official
said
he
hoped
more
members
would
deliver
on
their
pledges
and
that
the
drop
in
supply
so
far
was
acceptable
calling
it
a
good
start
crude
oil
has
risen
to
a
barrel
after
a
dip
below
in
december
boosted
by
the
saudi
cuts
a
host
of
involuntary
curbs
in
other
opec
countries
and
the
prospect
of
lower
supply
from
venezuela
after
president
donald
trump
this
week
imposed
sanctions
on
its
oil
industry
opec
russia
and
other
an
alliance
known
as
agreed
in
december
to
reduce
supply
by
million
bpd
from
opec
s
share
of
the
cut
is
bpd
to
be
delivered
by
members
all
except
iran
libya
and
venezuela
in
january
the
opec
members
bound
by
the
agreement
achieved
percent
of
the
pledged
cuts
the
survey
found
further
declines
in
iran
libya
and
venezuela
boosted
the
total
opec
decline
to
bpd
the
latest
deal
came
months
after
they
had
agreed
to
pump
more
oil
which
in
turn
partially
unwound
their
original
accord
that
took
effect
in
the
biggest
drop
in
supply
came
from
saudi
arabia
opec
s
biggest
oil
producer
which
pumped
bpd
less
than
in
december
the
survey
showed
saudi
supply
in
november
had
hit
a
million
bpd
after
trump
demanded
more
be
pumped
to
curb
rising
prices
and
make
up
for
losses
from
iran
the
kingdom
rapidly
changed
course
as
prices
slid
on
the
prospect
of
oversupply
in
the
and
drops
occurred
in
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
which
like
saudi
delivered
a
larger
cut
than
required
under
the
deal
the
survey
found
of
the
three
opec
members
exempted
from
making
voluntary
cuts
libyan
production
fell
the
most
as
unrest
kept
the
country
s
biggest
oilfield
sharara
offline
for
a
month
output
from
iran
declined
further
as
sanctions
discouraged
companies
from
buying
its
oil
iran
has
managed
to
maintain
crude
exports
of
as
much
as
million
bpd
helped
by
sanctions
waivers
and
its
efforts
to
keep
selling
crude
production
in
venezuela
once
a
opec
producer
but
whose
output
has
been
sliding
amid
the
country
s
economic
collapse
posted
a
further
drop
in
january
the
survey
found
the
sanctions
imposed
on
state
oil
firm
pdvsa
this
week
are
keeping
tankers
stuck
at
ports
and
expected
to
accelerate
the
supply
drop
in
february
among
countries
showing
lower
compliance
iraq
reduced
output
in
january
but
pumped
more
than
its
target
as
did
nigeria
and
algeria
gabon
kept
output
steady
the
reuters
