trans-gambia bridge a boon for trade, but a blow for local traders
gambia
reuters
a
gleaming
new
bridge
in
west
africa
is
transforming
transport
between
gambia
and
senegal
but
spells
disaster
for
traders
making
a
living
off
travellers
making
the
agonising
wait
to
catch
a
ferry
across
the
gambia
river
gambia
is
a
sliver
of
land
on
either
side
of
the
river
cutting
through
the
middle
of
the
much
larger
senegal
the
product
of
a
deal
between
britain
and
france
staking
a
claim
to
each
the
absurd
geography
means
anyone
crossing
from
northern
to
southern
senegal
or
has
to
enter
gambia
and
before
the
bridge
join
long
queues
to
cross
the
river
the
wait
for
the
ferry
could
take
up
to
a
week
the
km
senegambia
bridge
which
opened
to
cars
and
minibuses
last
week
changed
all
that
i
m
happy
about
this
bridge

said
of
the
concrete
structure
stretching
high
over
the
river
from
one
shore
to
the
other
vehicles
just
come
and
pass
without
any
trucks
will
not
be
allowed
on
the
bridge
until
july
and
drivers
can
hardly
wait
a
few
months
ago
i
spent
days
at
the
ferry
terminal
before
it
was
my
time
to
cross
senegalese
truck
driver
mawdo
saine
told
reuters
as
he
waited
to
board
a
boat
at
barra
a
rusting
ferry
terminal
on
the
sandy
riverbank
that
s
a
lot
of
difficulty
for
us
drivers
because
what
you
should
do
in
one
week
you
end
up
doing
in
one
the
bridge
is
also
a
welcome
success
for
gambia
one
of
the
poorest
countries
in
west
africa
after
more
than
two
decades
of
dictatorship
but
ferry
operators
and
food
vendors
who
serve
the
river
traffic
are
struggling
wuyeh
jaiteh
who
supports
a
large
extended
family
says
he
used
to
make
west
african
francs
pounds
a
day
from
ferrying
people
across
the
river
but
since
last
week
his
customers
have
disappeared
today
is
my
third
day
here
that
i
have
not
gone
home
because
there
is
nothing
to
take
to
the
family
jaiteh
said
i
will
have
to
spend
the
jaiteh
admitted
the
bridge
was
good
for
development
but
like
other
traders
said
he
would
need
government
help
for
years
i
have
been
selling
at
this
place
walking
around
to
sell
stuff
like
torches
and
perfume
hawker
bubacarr
jallow
said
we
are
appealing
to
the
government
to
see
how
to
help
us
because
this
is
what
we
depend
on
