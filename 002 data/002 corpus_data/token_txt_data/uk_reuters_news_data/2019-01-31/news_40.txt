soothing
sounds
from
the
federal

propelled
world
stocks
to
their
best
january
on
record
on
thursday
although
having
scored
stellar
gains
this
time
last
year
only
to
flop
spectacularly
traders
were
trying
not
to
get
too
carried

said
it

pause
its

campaign
while
assessing
the
weakening
of
the

crucially
it
also
said
that
the
rundown
of
its

sheet
or
the
stockpile
of

it

accumulated
over
the
past
years
of

that
ticked
all
the
boxes
for

wall

and
asia
both
rallied
and
europe
ran
up
as
much
as
percent
until
news
that
italy
was
back
in
recession
and
other
poor
data
took
the
wind
out
of
the
sails
of

that

lifted
the

which
tracks

for
the

out
of

last
for
january
it
is
up
more

is
its
best

the

in

dived

and
europe
s
big
move
saw
italian

hit
their
lowest
since

but
it
was
all
pain
for
the
dollar
it
was
struggling
near
a

but
if
what

is
where

the

the

practices
and
fully
protect
