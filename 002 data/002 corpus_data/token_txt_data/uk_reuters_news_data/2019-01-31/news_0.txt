venezuela
is
ramping
up
pressure
on
fuel
suppliers
to
deliver
cargoes
to
its
oil
firm
even
if
payment
issues
have
not
been
sorted
amid
sanctions
while
european
clients
put
scheduled
export
shipments
on
hold
the
country
s
fuel
stocks
have
drained
further
in
recent
days
as
domestic
refineries
produce
little
and
pdvsa
faces
complications
linked
to
new
sanctions
aimed
at
ousting
president
nicolas
maduro
from
power
on
thursday
intelligence
police
and
national
guard
officials
threatened
to
board
a
tanker
docked
at
pdvsa
s
cardon
port
on
venezuela
s
western
coast
to
pressure
the
vessel
s
crew
to
discharge
diesel
that
had
not
been
paid
for
by
pdvsa
and
was
sold
by
refiner
citgo
petroleum
according
to
four
sources
the
furor
dissipated
after
pdvsa
told
the
crew
a
court
order
would
be
issued
to
have
the
cargo
discharged
but
it
underscores
growing
tension
over
fuel
needs
in
the
country
venezuela
has
less
than
two
weeks
left
of
gasoline
and
diesel
supply
according
to
some
estimates
with
lines
at
gas
stations
starting
to
form
around
the
nation
the
united
states
and
most
latin
american
governments
have
recognized
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
as
rightful
the
european
parliament
on
thursday
also
backed
guaido
and
agreed
to
lead
an
international
crisis
group
to
seek
new
elections
threatening
further
economic
sanctions
that
could
cut
off
the
flow
of
venezuelan
oil
to
europe
adding
to
a
glut
sitting
off
pdvsa
s
ports
that
total
over
two
dozen
tankers
carrying
almost
million
barrels
of
crude
the
sanctions
prevent
payments
from
going
to
maduro
s
government
the
stuck
cargoes
include
vessels
meant
to
go
to
clients
including
citgo
valero
energy
chevron
corp
and
pbf
energy
refineries
in
the
united
states
have
started
to
reduce
crude
processing
and
valero
said
thursday
that
it
had
stopped
buying
venezuelan
crude
pdvsa
earlier
this
week
said
no
crude
tankers
will
be
allowed
to
set
sail
if
cargoes
are
not
paid
in
advance
but
the
company
and
its
customers
have
not
yet
found
a
way
to
secure
those
payments
without
contravening
sanctions
pdvsa
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
the
tanker
carrying
diesel
arrived
in
venezuelan
waters
on
before
sanctions
were
issued
and
finished
unloading
a
first
parcel
of
diesel
at
puerto
la
cruz
refinery
s
dock
earlier
this
week
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
data
but
when
it
started
to
discharge
a
second
parcel
at
cardon
the
process
was
suspended
according
to
the
sources
the
mambo
tanker
was
originally
loaded
with
barrels
of
diesel
bought
by
citgo
from
a
supplier
they
added
european
refiners
and
oil
firms
including
pdvsa
s
partner
nynas
ab
and
spain
s
repsol
have
put
on
hold
cargoes
that
were
scheduled
to
be
shipped
from
venezuela
until
the
treasury
clarifies
if
oil
swaps
will
be
allowed
and
european
countries
announce
any
sanctions
to
come
according
to
sources
and
refinitiv
eikon
data
we
have
no
way
to
lift
venezuelan
crude
right
now
said
a
trader
from
an
european
company
that
has
two
cargoes
on
hold
at
jose
terminal
on
venezuela
s
eastern
coast
nynas
said
it
would
not
respond
to
rumors
and
repsol
was
not
immediately
available
for
comment
sanctions
do
not
prohibit
europe
from
receiving
venezuelan
oil
or
trading
houses
including
ones
like
trafigura
or
vitol
from
acting
as
intermediaries
for
venezuelan
cargoes
to
be
ultimately
sold
to
refineries
around
the
world
but
white
house
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
on
wednesday
warned
pdvsa
s
customers
and
partners
off
continuing
to
do
business
with
the
oil
company
