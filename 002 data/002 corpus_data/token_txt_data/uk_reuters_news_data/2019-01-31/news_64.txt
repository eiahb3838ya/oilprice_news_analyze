british car industry warns against no-deal brexit as investment slumps
london
reuters
investment
in
the
british
car
industry
halved
last
year
due
largely
to
uncertainty
about
future
trade
with
the
eu
and
surveys
showed
consumers
and
businesses
were
more
anxious
about
the
economic
outlook
as
britain
heads
towards
a
brexit
the
society
of
motor
manufacturers
and
traders
said
on
thursday
that
investment
in
britain
s
automotive
sector
was
million
pounds
last
year
nearly
percent
less
than
in
and
the
lowest
since
the
financial
crisis
investment
has
effectively
stalled
said
smmt
chief
executive
mike
hawes
who
called
on
the
government
to
avoid
the
permanent
devastation
of
a
exit
by
britain
from
the
european
union
a
lot
of
that
is
on
hold
because
until
you
see
what
the
future
is
do
you
have
the
confidence
to
invest
in
that
plant
when
there
is
that
sort
of
uncertainty
production
also
fell
by
percent
the
smmt
said
it
expected
car
production
to
fall
another
percent
in
assuming
an
orderly
brexit
with
a
transition
period
to
minimise
economic
disruption
some
britons
are
employed
in
the
car
industry
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
eu
the
world
s
biggest
trading
bloc
on
march
its
lawmakers
have
rejected
the
withdrawal
agreement
prime
minister
theresa
may
negotiated
with
brussels
leaving
the
country
on
course
for
an
abrupt
exit
that
could
cause
major
disruptions
to
trade
as
may
headed
back
to
brussels
on
thursday
to
demand
changes
to
her
divorce
deal
leading
eu
lawmaker
danuta
hubner
warned
that
the
risk
of
a
brexit
had
grown
hubner
told
reuters
the
bloc
could
offer
britain
more
assurances
over
the
backstop
aimed
at
preventing
a
hard
border
in
ireland
in
a
political
declaration
on
ties
if
london
moves
towards
staying
in
a
customs
union
with
the
eu
may
wants
to
replace
the
emergency
irish
border
fix
with
unspecified
alternative
arrangements
something
the
eu
says
is
vague
and
not
enough
of
a
guarantee
if
there
is
no
openness
on
the
uk
side
to
include
those
assurances
in
the
political
declaration
on
the
future
ties
the
process
could
mechanically
take
us
to
hubner
said
other
data
on
thursday
showed
confidence
among
british
consumers
held
at
a
year
low
in
january
increasing
gloom
about
the
outlook
for
the
next
months
was
offset
by
a
small
improvement
in
personal
finances
the
gfk
index
showed
surveys
of
businesses
by
the
confederation
of
british
industry
and
lloyds
bank
also
gave
a
sobering
outlook
for
the
world
s
economy
house
prices
a
key
barometer
of
consumer
confidence
in
britain
rose
by
just
percent
in
annual
terms
in
january
their
weakest
rise
in
nearly
six
years
britain
s
housing
market
has
slowed
since
the
brexit
referendum
in
june
when
nationwide
estimated
house
prices
were
rising
by
around
percent
a
year
but
warnings
by
former
finance
minister
george
osborne
that
a
leave
vote
would
hit
the
value
of
people
s
homes
by
up
to
percent
have
not
materialised
that
has
led
many
advocates
of
brexit
to
dismiss
as
a
continued
project
fear
current
warnings
that
a
scenario
could
cause
severe
disruptions
to
food
and
medical
supplies
transportation
and
manufacturing
but
the
smmt
s
hawes
pinned
the
fall
in
automotive
industry
investment
firmly
on
the
uncertainties
surrounding
brexit
i
think
the
numbers
give
the
lie
to
that
accusation
investment
figures
production
figures
said
hawes
if
it
s
project
fear
then
we
re
doing
a
good
impression

it
