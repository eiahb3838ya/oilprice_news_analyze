soothing
sounds
from
the
federal
reserve
propelled
world
stocks
to
their
best
january
on
record
on
thursday
although
having
scored
stellar
gains
this
time
last
year
only
to
flop
spectacularly
traders
were
trying
not
to
get
too
carried
away
the
fed
said
it
would
pause
its
interest
rate
rise
campaign
while
assessing
the
weakening
of
the
economy
crucially
it
also
said
that
the
rundown
of
its
balance
sheet
or
the
stockpile
of
bonds
it
has
accumulated
over
the
past
years
of
quantitative
easing
could
slow
too
that
ticked
all
the
boxes
for
financial
markets
and
saw
europe
s
bulls
push
london
frankfurt
and
paris
up
to
percent
after
wall
street
and
then
asia
had
both
charged
overnight
added
together
it
lifted
the
trillion
msci
world
stocks
index
which
tracks
countries
up
percent
and
for
the
day
out
of
the
last
for
january
it
is
up
more
than
percent
which
is
its
best
january
since
the
index
began
in
and
the
best
performance
in
any
month
since
december
the

really
does

costs
had
dived
significantly
and
europe
s
big
move
saw
italian
yields
hit
their
lowest
since
may
but
was
all
pain
for
the
dollar
it
was
struggling
near
a
trough
against
its
major
peers
and
emerging
market
currencies
rose
almost
in

been
steamrollered

said
we
may
yet
get
a
fed
rate
hike
in

but
if
what
matters
is
where

heading
in
the
medium

the
fx
market
would
overlook
that
and
sell
the
dollar
stocks
were
also
expected
to
open
higher

the

had
dovetailed
with
reassuring

on
wednesday
and
with

then
rose
to
its

helped
by
a

jump
on

nikkei

shrugged
off
the
normal
headwind

the
talks
which
began
in
washington
on

are
expected
to
be
tense
with
little
indication
so
far
that
beijing
is
willing

address
core
