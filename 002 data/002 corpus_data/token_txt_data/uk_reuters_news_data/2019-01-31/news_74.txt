including
ocrevus
for

hemlibra
for
hemophilia
a
and
cancer
medicines
alecensa
and
tecentriq
almost
percent
of
our

rejuvenating

the

one
drag

to
be
intermune
which
roche
spent

called

schwan
said
s
billion
offer
for

said
roche
continued
to
benefit
from
growing
sales
in
china
which
bought
more
older
medicines
whose
sales
have
fallen
elsewhere
following
patent
expiries

really
soared

said
i
would
expect
the
momentum

where
biosimilar

are
impacting

sales
rose
percent
to

while

schwan
called

disappointing
but
the
consequence
