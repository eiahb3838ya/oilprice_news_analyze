trudeau
who
swept
to
power
on
a
wave
of
optimism
in
is
set
for
an
ugly
reelection
campaign
this
october
judging
by
exchanges
with
voters
in
public
town
halls
this
month
where
he
was
grilled
on
topics
ranging
from
immigration
to
housing
affordability
opinion
polls
show
his
liberals
are
barely
ahead
of
their
rivals
and
party
insiders
privately
admit
they
might
lose
their
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
which
would
crimp
the
government
s
ability
to
govern
the
next
election
is
going
to
be
a
referendum
on
justin
trudeau
and
whether
or
not
people
think
he
has
performed

public
affairs
pollster
darrell
bricker
in
contrast
to
more
gentle
exchanges
in
previous
years
angry
citizens
slammed
trudeau
for
bungling
the
construction
of
pipelines
breaking
promises
to
respect
the
right
of
indigenous
groups
ignoring
a
pledge
to
balance
the
budget
and
allowing
too
many
migrants
into
canada
liberal
insiders
say
as
a
result
of
the
feedback
from
the
town
halls
where
attendees
can
also
jot
down
their
concerns
on
paper
policy
tweaks
are
already
being
considered
public
unhappiness
over
illegal
immigrants
crossing
the
border
from
the
united
states
is
so
great
that
the
party
will
consider
a
promise
to
clamp
down
further
even
though
ottawa
considers
the
matter
is
under
control
said
one
top
liberal
widespread
complaints
about
the
lack
of
affordable
housing
are
likely
to
produce
a
commitment
for
more
spending
said
the
liberal
who
declined
to
be
identified
given
the
sensitivity
of
the
situation
the
verdict
from
voters
is
definitely
mixed
judging
by
trudeau
s
experiences
as
he
travelled
the
country
in
january
taking
questions
from
a
practise
he
says
helps
him
break
out
of
what
he
calls
the
ottawa
bubble
a
woman
at
a
town
hall
in
the
province
of
saskatchewan
in
canada
s
west
a
region
where
the
liberals
are
in
trouble
accused
trudeau
of
working
for
your
globalist
partners
to
betray
canada
what
do
we
do
with
traitors
in
canada
trudeau
we
used
to
hang
them
hang
them
for
treason
the
woman
told
the
stunned
prime
minister
after
asking
him
about
moslem
sharia
law
and
saudi
arabian
oil
imports
in
the
quebec
town
of
a
man
dressed
in
a
yellow
vest
swore
loudly
at
trudeau
and
accused
him
of
selling
out
the
country
liberals
like
the
town
halls
on
the
grounds
they
demonstrate
trudeau
is
not
afraid
to
take
tough
questions
yet
they
also
admit
the
exchanges
show
voters
have
more
urgent
concerns
than
topics
such
as
gender
equality
climate
change
and
the
aboriginal
rights
that
trudeau
has
been
pushing
hard
at
home
and
abroad
since
he
took
power
in
we
need
to
focus
on
things
that
are
of
interest
to
all
canadians
and
not
just
some
of
them
conceded
a
second
liberal
while
trudeau
has
emerged
as
one
of
the
world
s
leading
progressive
leaders
at
home
canadians
are
concentrating
more
on
their
jobs
and
taxes
said
bricker
infrastructure
minister
champagne
present
in
the
hall
at
as
abuse
was
levelled
at
trudeau
conceded
there
is
a
level
of
anxiety
out
there
and
we
need
to
allow
for
these
discussions
to
but
insiders
say
regardless
of
the
insults
trudeau
intends
to
stick
to
his
policy
of
avoiding
public
arguments
the
liberals
won
a
surprise
victory
in
by
mounting
a
massive
campaign
to
register
young
and
aboriginal
voters
and
concede
a
similar
effort
will
be
needed
this
time
the
liberals
have
a
majority
of
just
in
the
house
of
commons
and
polls
show
they
are
only
slightly
ahead
of
the
main
opposition
conservative
party
led
by
andrew
scheer
it
s
going
to
be
tight
the
message
to
the
troops
is
there
is
no
magic
commercial
advert
that
is
going
to
win
this
campaign
don
t
rely
on
the
prime
minister
to
belt
one
out
of
the

the
debates
