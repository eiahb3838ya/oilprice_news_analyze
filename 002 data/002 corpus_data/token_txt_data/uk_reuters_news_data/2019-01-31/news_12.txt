the
canadian
government
paid
a
high
price
for
the
trans
mountain
oil
pipeline
last
summer
and
delays
in
expanding
it
could
reduce
its
resale
value
a
watchdog
on
the
country
s
public
finances
said
on
thursday
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
s
government
purchased
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
and
a
related
expansion
in
august
from
kinder
morgan
canada
fearing
the
company
might
abandon
the
capacity
expansion
the
project
and
others
like
it
have
faced
stiff
opposition
in
canada
from
environmental
groups
and
some
local
governments
the
canadian
government
paid
c
billion
for
the
pipeline
related
assets
and
the
expansion
project
and
intends
to
eventually
sell
it
the
pipeline
running
from
alberta
s
hub
to
the
vancouver
british
columbia
area
is
actually
worth
between
c
billion
and
c
billion
the
parliamentary
budget
officer
pbo
said
in
an
analysis
expansion
is
likely
to
cost
c
billion
for
an
date
at
the
end
of
the
pbo
wrote
delays
in
construction
however
could
reduce
its
value
it
said
herbert
a
spokesperson
for
finance
minister
bill
morneau
noted
that
the
pbo
s
analysis
did
not
include
the
benefit
that
moving
oil
to
new
markets
would
have
on
canada
s
economy
most
canadian
oil
ships
to
the
united
states
but
an
expanded
trans
mountain
may
allow
for
greater
asian
sales
when
the
political
risks
made
it
too
difficult
for
the
private
sector
to
move
forward
and
after
extensive
due
diligence
our
government
acquired
the
project
herbert
said
congested
pipelines
depressed
canadian
oil
prices
severely
last
year
causing
the
alberta
government
to
impose
mandatory
production
cuts
this
month
the
opposition
conservative
party
chastised
trudeau
in
a
statement
saying
he
overpaid
for
the
pipeline
in
the
past
the
conservatives
have
criticized
the
liberal
prime
minister
for
doing
too
little
to
help
the
struggling
industry
an
appeals
court
last
summer
overturned
the
government
s
approval
for
expanding
trans
mountain
saying
the
national
energy
board
needed
to
address
risks
to
marine
life
and
government
must
better
consult
indigenous
people
after
a
new
review
the
board
is
scheduled
to
report
to
trudeau
s
cabinet
next
month
