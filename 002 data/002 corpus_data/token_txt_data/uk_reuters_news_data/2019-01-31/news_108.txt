jan
reuters
three
days
after
proclaiming
himself
venezuela
s
head
of
state
juan
guaido
wrote
to
the
united
nations
antonio
guterres
asking
for
help
in
tackling
the
country
s
urgent
humanitarian
crisis
but
venezuela
s
seat
at
the
world
body
is
held
by
president
nicolas
maduro
s
government
and
guterres
is
unable
to
ramp
up
a
humanitarian
response
in
venezuela
without
maduro
s
approval
or
security
council
authorization
the
united
nations
are
ready
to
increase
their
activities
in
venezuela
in
the
areas
of
humanitarian
assistance
and
development
guterres
told
guaido
in
a
letter
dated
and
seen
by
reuters
on
wednesday
for
that
the
united
nations
need
however
the
consent
and
cooperation
of
the
the
exchange
illustrates
how
a
campaign
for
international
recognition
of
guaido
over
maduro
has
left
the
and
other
international
organizations
caught
in
the
middle
of
global
division
over
the
issue
most
latin
american
countries
canada
and
european
nations
have
recognized
guaido
or
are
on
the
verge
of
doing
so
but
these
rapid
endorsements
have
triggered
angry
responses
from
russia
china
and
a
few
latin
american
states
and
wariness
from
some
african
and
caribbean
nations
guterres
noted
that
in
his
relations
with
member
states
he
respects
the
decisions
of
the
intergovernmental
bodies
particularly
the
general
assembly
and
the
security
the
general
assembly
allows
each
nation
one
vote
while
the
five
permanent
members
of
the
security
council
charged
with
maintaining
international
peace
include
russia
and
china
the
international
split
is
also
hampering
swift
decisions
at
other
multilateral
groups
like
the
international
monetary
fund
and
the
world
bank
whose
recognition
of
the
guaido
government
could
eventually
help
get
loans
to
venezuela
maduro
s
government
has
denied
that
there
is
a
humanitarian
crisis
in
the
country
blaming
economic
problems
on
sanctions
venezuela
is
struggling
with
hunger
preventable
diseases
and
hyperinflation
forecast
at
million
percent
in
the
quickest
way
for
a
country
or
countries
to
try
and
deprive
maduro
s
government
of
venezuela
s
seat
would
be
to
present
a
draft
resolution
to
the
general
assembly
for
a
vote
however
diplomats
said
that
such
a
move
could
not
currently
garner
the
majority
support
needed
to
be
successful
we
do
think
there
will
be
appropriate
resolutions
when
the
time
is
right
and
we
ll
certainly
support
those
they
won
t
come
just
from
us
they
ll
come
from
other
nations
who
care
deeply
abut
the
venezuelan
people
as
well
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
told
reporters
at
the
on
saturday
maduro
was
sworn
in
on
for
a
second
term
in
office
after
elections
last
year
that
were
widely
dubbed
illegitimate
while
guaido
took
the
helm
of
the
elected
national
assembly
earlier
this
month
and
on
proclaimed
himself
the
country
s
rightful
leader
a
heated
security
council
meeting
on
saturday
revealed
the
bitter
divide
over
the
crisis
when
asked
about
the
possibility
of
a
showdown
over
venezuela
s
seat
russian
ambassador
vassily
nebenzia
said
maduro
s
government
was
legitimate
and
there
was
no
need
to
challenge
its
credentials
the
has
previously
had
to
address
competing
claims
for
representation
at
the
world
body
in
september
the
general
assembly
approved
a
libyan
request
to
accredit
envoys
of
the
country
s
interim
government
as
tripoli
s
sole
representatives
at
the
world
body
effectively
recognizing
the
national
transitional
council
the
move
came
after
the
united
states
russia
china
and
european
nations
had
all
recognized
that
council
so
far
guaido
has
named
envoys
to
washington
and
the
organization
of
american
states
regional
bloc
if
he
decided
to
name
a
envoy
such
a
request
would
traditionally
be
sent
to
guterres
and
then
considered
by
a
credentials
committee
which
includes
the
united
states
russia
and
china
the
imf
and
world
bank
could
eventually
test
support
for
guaido
through
a
straw
poll
of
member
countries
that
make
up
their
respective
executive
boards
according
to
several
bank
and
fund
officials
the
united
states
is
the
largest
and
most
influential
member
country
in
both
organizations
latin
america
s
largest
lender
the
development
bank
iadb
could
be
the
first
financial
institution
to
put
the
issue
before
its
board
even
as
soon
as
next
week
according
to
some
officials
several
board
officials
however
cautioned
that
the
membership
was
divided
and
there
was
no
consensus
on
how
to
proceed
still
recognition
by
global
lenders
of
guaido
will
not
automatically
unlock
multilateral
funding
any
time
soon
officials
said
venezuela
is
million
in
arrears
to
the
iadb
and
was
censured
by
the
imf
last
year
for
failing
to
provide
economic
data
to
the
fund
it
is
not
obvious
what
the
is
going
to
do
much
less
what
the
imf
would
do
said
james
boughton
the
imf
s
former
historian
now
at
the
center
for
international
governance
innovation
it
would
be
up
to
a
member
country
to
request
the
acknowledgement
of
a
new
government
in
this
case
it
would
come
from
the
said
boughton
when
that
happens
then
it
is
just
a
question
of
a
simple
majority
decision
by
the
executive
board

imf
rules
