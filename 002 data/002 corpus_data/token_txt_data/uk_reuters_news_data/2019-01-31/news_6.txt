reuters
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
signalled
her
readiness
on
thursday
to
implement
costly
proposals
tabled
by
a
commission
to
facilitate
the
phasing
out
of
power
but
key
questions
about
money
and
priorities
remain
the
commission
proposed
the
shutdown
of
all
germany
s
coal
power
stations
by
at
the
latest
recommending
that
at
least
billion
euros
billion
in
aid
be
provided
for
affected
regions
with
further
payments
to
cushion
the
potential
burden
of
rising
energy
prices
for
companies
and
consumers
speaking
after
a
meeting
with
state
premiers
merkel
said
that
the
federal
government
would
handle
the
commission
s
proposals
very
carefully
adding
that
the
of
power
plants
was
a
task
for
society
as
a
whole
the
leader
said
the
government
would
present
a
draft
law
by
may
in
which
berlin
would
address
the
commission
s
recommendations
touching
on
the
thorny
issue
of
how
to
finance
its
switch
away
from
coal
merkel
said
it
was
too
early
to
start
a
debate
about
money
the
government
s
budget
plans
cover
a
time
period
until
we
re
talking
about
nobody
knows
what
the
planning
will
be
in
the
future
merkel
said
finance
minister
olaf
scholz
made
clear
that
he
is
not
planning
to
allocate
any
extra
money
to
help
with
the
phasing
out
of
power
complicating
efforts
by
europe
s
largest
economy
to
achieve
its
climate
protection
goals
scholz
told
handelsblatt
business
daily
that
the
proposed
billion
euros
of
annual
aid
until
was
a
plausible
assumption
but
other
ministries
would
have
to
manage
the
coal
shift
with
money
from
existing
budgets
we
have
earmarked
big
funds
for
investments
for
example
in
the
budgets
of
the
transport
ministry
economy
ministry
science
ministry
and
construction
ministry
scholz
said
scholz
a
member
of
the
social
democrats
junior
partner
in
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
coalition
government
rejected
the
coal
commission
s
proposal
to
support
the
construction
of
new
gas
power
plants
with
state
money
he
said
that
state
money
would
be
better
used
in
research
to
fund
solutions
such
as
using
hydrogen
as
an
energy
source
reiner
haseloff
prime
minister
in
the
eastern
state
of
called
on
the
federal
government
to
implement
the
coal
commission
s
proposals
without
changes
the
proposals
must
be
implemented
as
recommended
changing
them
would
jeopardize
the
compromise
as
a
whole
haseloff
told
reuters
the
billion
euros
are
urgently
needed
to
cushion
the
earlier
exit
from
brown
coal
as
demanded
by
the
federal
