a
change
in
government
in
venezuela

favour
the
country
s
two
main
foreign

russia
and
china
venezuelan
opposition

and
interim
president
juan
guaido
told

sent
communications
to
both
allies

who
accuses
guaido
of
staging
a
coup
against
his
socialist
administration
the
united
states
and
a
number
of
other
countries
now
recognise
guaido
as
venezuela
s
legitimate
head
of
state
what
most
suits
russia
and
china
is
the
country
s
stability
and
a
change
of
government
he
said
maduro
does
not
protect
venezuela
he
doesn
t
protect
anyone
s
investments
and
he
is
not
a
good
deal
for
those
guaido
was
speaking
from
his
caracas
home
where
earlier
on
thursday
agents
from
a
feared
special
police
unit
turned
up
to
ask
for
his
wife
a
sign
of
increasing
pressure
maduro
is
putting
on
the
opposition
in
the
interview
he
said
he
had
no
fear
of
a
possible
arrest
after
the
supreme
court
approved
the
opening
of
a
preliminary
investigation
into
his
actions
on
tuesday
imposing
a
travel
ban
and
a
freeze
on
his
bank
accounts
guaido
said
the
venezuelan
government
would
be
responsible
to
its
creditors
and
bondholders
guaido
does
not
yet
control
any
of
the
state
s
functions
which
remain
loyal
to
maduro
despite
the
opposition
s
calls
for
defections
guaido
said
he
was
evaluating
how
to
take
control
of
oil
firm
pdvsa
s
unit
citgo
venezuela
s
biggest
foreign
asset
as
the
trump
administration
tries
to
use
the
company
as
leverage
to
topple
maduro
the
government
and
guaido
are
trying
to
appoint
a
new
board
of
directors
for
citgo
under
a
future
government
pdvsa
would
remain
in
state
hands
guaido
said
adding
the
top
priority
would
be
on
recovering
production
in
the
devastated
oil
sector
we
are
here
to
provide
certainty
to
the
economy
society
and
in
politics
