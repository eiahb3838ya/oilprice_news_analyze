poll-oil faces uphill struggle as shale, growth risks challenge opec cuts
bengaluru
reuters
oil
prices
will
struggle
to
gain
much
upward
traction
this
year
as
concern
about
the
global
economy
and
growth
in
crude
supply
could
offset
a
boost
from
opec
production
cuts
and
sanctions
on
iran
and
venezuela
a
reuters
poll
showed
the
low
for
longer
view
is
deferred
but
not
repealed
julius
baer
analyst
carsten
menke
said
the
survey
of
economists
and
analysts
forecast
brent
crude
oil
futures
to
average
a
barrel
in
down
from
the
projected
in
the
previous
monthly
poll
this
is
the
third
consecutive
month
in
which
analysts
have
cut
their
oil
price
forecasts
oil
demand
will
underperform
averages
in
as
major
consuming
economies
face
a
slowdown
and
serious
downside
risks
not
least
of
which
is
the
trade
dispute
edward
bell
of
emirates
nbd
bank
said
despite
opec
cuts
supply
growth
will
still
be
positive
and
contribute
to
an
overall
market
surplus
and
stockbuilds
in
the
price
of
brent
marked
its
first
annual
decline
in
three
years
in
and
has
averaged
about
a
barrel
so
far
this
year
under
pressure
mainly
from
concerns
about
a
global
economic
slowdown
exacerbated
by
the
trade
war
between
the
united
states
and
china
and
booming
output
potential
supply
losses
from
iran
and
venezuela
due
to
sanctions
coupled
with
production
cuts
led
by
opec
and
russia
have
helped
prices
recover
by
about
percent
since
touching
their
lowest
in
nearly
months
on
an
group
of
leading
producers
meets
on
april
in
vienna
to
review
their
supply
cuts
which
were
agreed
in
december
in
an
effort
to
drain
global
stockpiles
the
potential
loss
in
supply
will
however
offer
only
limited
support
to
prices
analysts
said
there
still
remains
a
fair
deal
of
hesitancy
in
going
long
the
oil
market
in
the
short
term
due
to
the
uncertain
economic
outlook
largely
tied
to
the
outcome
of
trade
talks
said
harry
tchilinguirian
strategist
at
bnp
paribas
global
oil
demand
is
seen
growing
by
between
and
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
mostly
in
line
with
the
international
energy
agency
s
million
bpd
forecast
but
it
will
largely
depend
on
the
economy
analysts
said
most
of
the
demand
growth
will
come
from
china
and
the
rest
of
asia
but
with
slowing
economic
growth
the
dynamics
from
the
emerging
markets
will
be
much
lower
than
last
year
said
frank
schallenberger
head
of
commodity
research
at
lbbw
on
the
supply
side
while
production
growth
could
slow
this
year
it
should
be
large
enough
to
limit
any
price
gains
shale
producers
remain
a
key
impediment
to
exponential
gains
in
oil
prices
swing
producers
will
capitalise
with
incremental
output
should
oil
prices
rise
sharply
from
cuts
said

lu

analyst

poll

crude

average
