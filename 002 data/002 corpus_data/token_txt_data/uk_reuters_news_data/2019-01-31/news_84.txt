on
wednesday
held
interest
rates
steady
as
expected
and
also
discarded
its
promises
of
further
gradual
increases
in

rates
the
central
bank
said
it
would
be
patient
before
making
any
further
moves
amid
a
suddenly
cloudy
outlook
for
the
economy

hopes
the

more
room
to
run

had
sunk
to
its

dogged
by
factors
including
worries
over
cooling
economic
growth
and
trade
tensions
adding
pressure
on
the
fed
to
reassess
its
tightening
bias
the
fed
s
statements
firmly
confirmed
its
dovish
stance
which
had
already
been
on
display
at
the
start
of
the
year
market
concerns
towards
the
fed
s
rate
hikes
have
now
been
put
to
rest
said
masahiro
ichikawa
senior
strategist
at
sumitomo
mitsui
asset
management
in
tokyo
the
mention
of
the
balance
sheet
by
the
fed
was
a
positive
surprise
the
focus
now
shifts
immediately
to
trade
talks
but
the
equity
markets
could
have
enough
cushioning
to
withstand
negative
news
from
the
the
central
bank
also
said
on
wednesday
that
its
balance
sheet
would
remain
larger
than
previously
expected
however
while
market
expectations
for
fed
tightening
may
have
waned
significantly
some
analysts
suggested
rate
hikes
still
remained
a
possibility
while
many
of
the
risks
to
the
outlook
remain
in
place
there
is
little
to
suggest
that
the
outlook
has
changed
by
as
much
as
the
fed
communication
says
it
has
wrote
michael
gapen
chief
economist
at
barclays
we
worry
that
the
fed
has
traded
support
for
financial
markets
and
the
economy
for
another
round
of
volatility
later
this
year
if
it
is
forced
to
lift
rates
higher
which
remains
more
likely
than
not
in
our
with
the
fed
decision
out
of
the
way
investors
focused
their
attention
on
a
pivotal
round
of
trade
talks
which
began
on
wednesday
aimed
at
easing
a
tariff
war
the
talks
in
washington
are
expected
to
be
tense
with
little
indication
so
far
that
chinese
officials
are
willing
to
address
core
demands
to
fully
protect
american
intellectual
property
rights
and
end
policies
that
washington
has
said
force
companies
to
transfer
technology
to
chinese
firms
if
the
two
sides
can

prevented
