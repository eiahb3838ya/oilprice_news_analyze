the

suggests
that
saudi
arabia
and
its
gulf
allies
on
pledged
supply
curbs
to
avert
the
possibility
of
a
new
glut
building
up
this
year
a
formal
accord

opec
and
its
allies
to
cut
supply
in
took
effect
on
crude
oil
has
risen
to
a
barrel
after
a
dip
below
in
december
boosted
by
the
saudi
move
a
host
of
involuntary
curbs
in
other
opec
countries

the
prospect
of

from

after

imposed
sanctions
on
its
oil
industry
opec
russia
and
other
an
alliance
known
as
agreed
in
