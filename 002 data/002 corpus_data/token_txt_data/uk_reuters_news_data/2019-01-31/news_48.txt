exclusive-u.n. may push back libya election conference
libya
reuters
the
united
nations
is
likely
to
delay
a
conference
intended
to
prepare
libya
for
elections
this
year
until
there
is
more
support
from
rival
leaders
sources
familiar
with
the
plans
said
the
national
meeting
is
central
to
a
and
western
roadmap
for
a
vote
in
libya
as
a
way
out
of
its
war
since
the
fall
of
muammar
gaddafi
but
big
players
and
their
allied
armed
groups
wield
considerable
power
under
the
status
quo
and
there
is
mistrust
between
rival
governments
and
parliaments
libya
splintered
following
the
revolt
against
gaddafi
and
has
since
been
divided
between
competing
political
and
armed
groups
based
in
tripoli
and
the
east
more
delay
in
the
conference
where
libyans
from
all
walks
of
society
are
supposed
to
decide
details
of
their
elections
such
as
the
presidential
or
parliamentary
system
would
also
probably
push
back
an
actual
vote
under
a
french
plan
libya
was
meant
to
hold
elections
last
but
that
was
shelved
due
to
divisions
among
rival
leaders
and
a
spike
in
violence
in
the
capital
tripoli
in
a
new
push
libya
envoy
ghassan
salame
wanted
a
conference
in
the
first
weeks
of
with
potential
polls
by
june
but
momentum
for
that
has
been
lost
due
to
resistance
from
major
parties
backing
the
parallel
governments
in
tripoli
and
the
east
who
benefit
from
access
to
oil
revenues
and
jobs
for
armed
groups
in
the
absence
of
police
power
play
sources
familiar
with
the
plans
told
reuters
the
conference
could
still
happen
by
the
end
of
february
but
a
delay
until
at
least
march
looked
more
likely
salame
won
t
announce
a
venue
and
date
ahead
until
he
thinks
there
is
enough
support
from
all
sides
one
source
said
the
mission
in
libya
said
it
was
seeking
a
successful
meeting
but
no
date
was
set
yet
we
plan
for
the
conference
to
happen
as
soon
as
possible
it
said
in
a
statement
to
reuters
diplomats
say
the
conference
is
a
last
joker
in
the
pack
for
salame
who
has
toiled
since
september
for
elections
western
nations
hope
ordinary
libyans
will
pressure
armed
groups
into
a
peaceful
solution
but
in
eastern
libya
some
worry
the
forum
may
give
a
platform
to
islamists
and
other
opponents
defeated
by
the
libyan
national
army
lna
of
khalifa
haftar
some
lawmakers
in
the
parliament
last
week
proposed
to
ban
the
muslim
brotherhood
that
would
make
it
difficult
to
talk
to
khaled
mishri
head
of
a
rival
parliament
in
tripoli
who
is
close
to
the
brotherhood
i
personally
think
the
conference
is
a
good
idea
but
it
will
be
hard
to
achieve
results
said
eastern
lawmaker
hamd
bazaq
diplomats
fear
a
recent
spat
between
salame
and
the
lna
might
further
complicate
preparing
the
conference
