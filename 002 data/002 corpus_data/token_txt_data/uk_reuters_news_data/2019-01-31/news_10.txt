it

faces
an
incredibly
tough

regulator
ofgem
imposed
a
price
cap
on
default
energy
bills
from

this
year
to
save
households
about
a
billion
pounds
a
year
following
a
government

ofgem
itself
forecasts
that
five
of
the
big
six
energy
companies
will
make
a
loss
or
less
than
normal
profits
this
year
due
to
the
implementation
of
the
price
cap
and
with
several
recent
failures
of
new

it
is

pricing

significant

it

large
energy
suppliers
have
been
losing
market
share
as
smaller

have
lured
customers
with
cheaper
deals

several
smaller
providers
have

sse
and
innogy
had
planned
to

this
was
scrapped
after
they

on
new
commercial
terms
after
the
price
cap
was
announced
