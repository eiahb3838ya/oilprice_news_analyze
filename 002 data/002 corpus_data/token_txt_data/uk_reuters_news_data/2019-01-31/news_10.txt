exxon
mobil
corp
on
thursday
outlined
a
major
reorganization
of
its
global
exploration
businesses
aimed
at
reversing
years
of
weak
oil
and
gas
output
chief
executive
darren
woods
who
took
over
the
helm
two
years
ago
has
spent
billions
to
buy
production
build
new
pipelines
and
expand
refineries
after
a
series
of
costly
misfires
on
deals
under
predecessor
rex
tillerson
woods
who
will
address
wall
street
analysts
on
an
earnings
call
friday
for
the
first
time
as
ceo
has
been
pleading
with
investors
for
patience
as
he
restructures
its
sprawling
businesses
the
exxon
veteran
replaced
tillerson
who
became
secretary
of
state
in
february
and
reorganized
exxon
s
refining
operations
that
year
exxon
which
has
spent
heavily
on
shale
and
blocks
in
brazil
and
guyana
has
posted
lower
output
in
nine
of
the
last
quarters
i
am
skeptical
that
this
decision
will
make
any
real
difference
in
practical
terms
said
pavel
molchanov
an
analyst
at
raymond
james
he
cited
hurdles
and
a
sharp
drop
in
output
in
a
gas
field
in
the
netherlands
that
accounts
for
percent
of
exxon
s
total
production
the
reorganization
will
fold
seven
companies
into
three
as
of
april
merging
units
for
production
exploration
development
gas
and
power
marketing
and
others
the
new
companies

co
exxonmobil
upstream
business
development
co
and
exxonmobil

are
designed
to
help
the
company
double
profits
by
and
better
coordinate
oil
and
gas
production
with
logistics
and
refining
operations
our
focus
is
on
increasing
overall
value
by
strengthening
our
upstream

further
integrating
it
with
the
downstream
and
chemical
segments

analysts
have
been
pushing
