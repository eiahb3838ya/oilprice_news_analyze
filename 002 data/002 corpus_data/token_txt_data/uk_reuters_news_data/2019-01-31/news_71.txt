petrochina
co
plans
to
drop

sa
pdvsa
as
a
partner
in
a
planned
billion
oil
refinery
and
petrochemical
project
in
southern
china
said
three
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
this
week
the
company
s
decision
adds
to
pdvsa
s
woes
after
the
united
states
imposed
sanctions
on
the
company
on
to
undermine
the
rule
of
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
however
dropping
the
company
was
not
a
reaction
to
the
sanctions
but
follows
the
deteriorating
financial
status
of
pdvsa
over
the
past
few
years
said
two
of
the
sources
both
executives
with
china
national
petroleum
corp
the
parent
of
petrochina
there
will
be
no
role
of
pdvsa
as
an
equity
partner
at
least
we
don
t
see
that
possibility
in
the
near
future
given
the
situation
the
country
has
been
through
in
recent
years
said
one
of
the
executives
asking
to
remain
unidentified
because
he
is
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
media
the
move
illustrates
the
fading
relationship
between
venezuela
and
china
which
has
given
billion
to
the
south
american
country
in
the
form
of
agreements
china
the
world
s
largest
oil
importer
is
now
the
buyer
of
venezuelan
crude
in
asia
taking
in
million
tonnes
or
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
that
relationship
began
to
fray
in
when
venezuela
requested
a
change
in
the
payment
terms
on
the
debt
to
ease
the
impact
of
its
falling
crude
output
and
declining
oil
prices
instead
of
handing
out
large
fresh
loans
beijing
has
shifted
to
small
investments
or
granting
extensions
in
the
grace
periods
for
the
outstanding
loans
the
sanctions
were
imposed
at
the
same
time
the
united
states
and
other
nations
have
backed
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
as
legitimate
ruler
instead
of
president
nicolas
maduro
during
maduro
s
rule
oil
production
has
plunged
while
millions
have
left
amid
hyperinflation
and
as
consumer
goods
have
vanished
from
market
shelves
pdvsa
was
originally
a
percent
equity
partner
in
the
refinery
project
located
the
city
of
jieyang
in
the
southern
province
of
guangdong
petrochina
and
pdvsa
received
environmental
approval
for
the
project
in
initial
plans
were
for
the
refinery
to
process
bpd
of
strictly
venezuelan
crude
oil
the
plans
have
now
been
expanded
to
focus
on
petrochemical
production
including
a
ethylene
plant
and
a
tpy
aromatics
plant
the
plant
is
expected
to
be
operational
by
late
caixin
reported
on
under
the
revised
plan
the
refinery
will
not
be
restricted
to
venezuelan
oil
but
could
process
other
heavy
crude
grades
that
could
come
from
middle
eastern
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
and
iran
