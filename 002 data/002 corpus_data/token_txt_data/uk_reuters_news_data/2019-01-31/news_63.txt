indonesian
insurance
rules
that

into
effect
on
are
causing
huge
coal
supply
backlogs
with
dozens
of
ships
held
up
outside
ports
unable
to
load
as
authorities
start
checking
to
see
if
vessels
are
in
compliance
with
the
new
policy
a
regulation
issued
in
august
last
year
requires
indonesian
exporters
of
coal
and
palm
oil
to
use
local
insurers
from
and
also
requires
them
to
use
local
shipping
companies

indonesia
is
the
world
s
biggest
exporter
of
thermal
coal
used
mostly
for
power
generation
the
country
exports
between
million
and
million
tonnes
of
coal
per
month
to
its
main
customers
in
india
china
japan
and
south
korea
hendra
sinadia
executive
director
of
indonesian
coal
mining
association
told
reuters
that
during
an
initial
trial
period
beginning
on
friday
exporters
without
indonesian
insurers
would
not
be
penalised
port
surveyors
however
were
checking
which
exporters
have
proper
insurance
he
said
sinadia
said
exports
won
t
be
disrupted
and
that
the
association
was
telling
its
members
it
was
business
as
usual
coal
traders
though
said
the
new
insurance
rules
were
already
causing
a
considerable
backlog
in
kalimantan
indonesia
s
biggest
region
it
is
pretty
chaotic
at
the
moment
some
shippers
haven
t
prepared
their
new
insurance
others
have
but
the
authorities
and
insurers
are
slow
to
register
said
one
trader
who
exports
kalimantan
coal
there
were
not
enough
surveyors
to
handle
the
fleet
of
ships
he
said
and
insurers
and
port
authorities
were
taking
a
long
time
to
issue
and
recognise
the
new
insurance
documents
the
main
concern
was
the
daily
charter
rate
of
a
ship
that
sits
idle
for
weeks
running
up
a
bill
in
the
tens
of
thousands
of
dollar
he
said
more
than
two
dozen
large
ships
are
currently
sitting
outside
the
port
of
samarinda
in
east
kalimantan
waiting
to
load
coal
according
to
refinitiv
ship
tracking
data
the
situation
is
similar
in
the
south
kalimantan
ports
of
taboneo
and
bunati
indonesian
coal
prices
have
so
far
not
been
heavily
affected
traders
said
as
asian
supplies
are
ample
prices
were
hovering
slightly
above
per
tonne
for
most
of
january
add
the
usual
port
and
mining
constraints
in
kalimantan
and
you
have
many
ships
that
have
been
sitting
outside
its
ports
for
many
weeks
the
trader
said
most
indonesian
coal
is
sold
on
a
fob
basis
where
insurance
is
the
responsibility
of
the
buyer

of
indonesian
insurance
companies
to
their
buyers

meanwhile
are
still
waiting
for
lists
of
insurers
from
