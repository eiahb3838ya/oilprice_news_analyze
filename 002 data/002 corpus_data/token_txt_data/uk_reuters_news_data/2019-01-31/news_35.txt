e
corp
as
a
result
of
over
billion
in
costs
from
california
wildfires
sparked
by
the
state
s
prolonged
drought
will
likely
prompt
more
companies
to
discuss
how
they
will
respond
to
the
effects
of
climate
change
on
their
businesses
already

and
investors
over

more
than
double
the
number
of
companies
discussing
climate
change
years

a
reuters
analysis
found
among
companies
focusing
on
climate
change
were
not
only
those
in
the
utility
or
energy
sectors
that
are
significant
emitters
of
carbon
but
companies
ranging
from
casino
operator
caesars
entertainment
corp
to
tool
maker
stanley
black

inc
that
tend
to
cater
to
consumers
and
are
feeling
the
effects
of
more
extreme
weather
patterns
fund
managers
and
analysts
say
that
the
increasing
focus
on
climate
change
and
its
impacts
comes
about
as
the
effects
of
extreme
weather
are
easier
to
quantify
whether
in
the
form
of
decreased
sales
of
winter
apparel
due
to
warming
trends
or
disruptions
in
supply
chains
due
to
hurricanes
a

from
s
p
global
for
instance
found
that
companies
that
mentioned
weather
as
a
factor
in
their
quarterly
results
said
it
influenced
their
earnings
by
an
average
of
percent
at
the
same
time
environmentally
focused
investors
in
the
esg
sector
who
rate
companies
based
on
their
environmental
social
and
governance
attributes
are
increasingly
influencing
company
behavior
as
corporations
work
to
appeal
to
the
growing
trillion
industry
the
pg
e
example
will
encourage
other
companies
to
think
about
climate
change
said
julie
gorte
a
senior
vice
president
at
pax
world
funds
which
has
billion
in
assets
under
management
the
science
is
getting
better
and
it
s
getting
harder
and
harder
for
companies
to
say
that
something
was
an
act
of
god
and
no
one
could
have
seen
it
at
the
same
time
investors
are
increasingly
focusing
on
companies
that
may
see
a
benefit
from
adapting
to
changing
climate
patterns
and
the
reduced
cost
of
renewable
energy
waste
management
inc
for
instance
is
reducing
its
climate
impact
and
its
energy
costs
by
converting
methane
into
natural
gas
to
fuel
its
trucks
while
data
center
operator
digital
realty
trust
inc
now
gets
over
percent
of
its
energy
from
renewable
sources
helping
it
secure
deals
with
companies
like
facebook
inc
that
are
hoping
to
reduce
their
own
environmental
impact
shares
of
waste
management
are
up
over
percent
over
the
last
months
while
shares
of
digital
realty
are
down
more
than
percent
regardless
of
what
happens
in
washington
management
teams
are
going
to
have
to
be
more
transparent
around
disclosures
and
opportunities
too
when
it
comes
to
the
impacts
of
climate
change
said
lori
keith
manager
of
the
billion
parnassus
mid
cap
fund
todd
rosenbluth
director
of
mutual
fund
and
exchange
traded
fund
research
at
new
cfra
said
that
companies
and
asset
managers
are
both
likely
to
pay
more
attention
to
climate
change
as
its
effects
become
more
apparent
and
investors
increasingly
focus
on
a
company
s
environmental
impact
environmentally
focused
investors
are
also
much
less
likely
to
be
swayed
by
lower
costs
at
competitors
making
them
especially
attractive
customers
for
asset
managers
he
said
there
is
much
less
performance
chasing
among
esg
investors
and
that
makes
them
more
appealing
as
an
investor
base
for
companies
and
fund
firms
alike
