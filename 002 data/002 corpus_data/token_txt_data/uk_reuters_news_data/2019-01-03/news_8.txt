for
three

in
a
remote
hilly
state
warning
that
every
second
counts
the
workers
were
ensnared
on
when
the
illegal
mine
in
the
northeastern
state
of
meghalaya
was
flooded

have
so
far
only
been
able
to
find
three

two

why
attempts

for

told
the
federal

represented
by

the
meghalaya
government
told
the
court
that
nearly
people
were
working
on
the

including
employees

meghalaya
s
disaster
management
minister
told
reuters
both
government
and
private
agencies
had
been
involved
in
the
bid
to
reach
the
miners
many
of
whose
family
members
have
given
up
hope
mining
has
killed
thousands
of
workers
in

including
children
before
india
s
environmental
court
banned
the
practice
in
early
at
its
peak
the
state
produced
coal
worth
billion
a
year
or
about
a
tenth
of
india
s
total
production
despite
the
ban
many
mines
continued
operatihere
requiring
workers
often
children
to
descend
hundreds
of
feet
on
bamboo
ladders
and
dig
coal
out
of
narrow
horizontal
seams
the
unsuccessful
rescue
bid
has
drawn
criticism
of
a
lack
of
urgency
shown
by
government
agencies
particularly
given
the
remote
location
of
the
mine
a
journey
to
which
can
take
more
than
five
hours
from
the
nearest
commercial
airport
in
guwahati
would
we
have
cared
more
if
the
miners
had
not
been
at
the
fringes
of
national
consciousness
in
the
northeast
senior
journalist
vir
sanghvi
asked
on
twitter
i
have
not
given
up
hope
but
our
response
to
this
crisis
shames
us
as
