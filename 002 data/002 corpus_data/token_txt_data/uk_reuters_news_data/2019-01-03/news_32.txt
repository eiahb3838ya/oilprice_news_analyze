reuters
residents
of
the
indian
capital
of
new
delhi
woke
on
thursday
to
a
thick
gray
smog
as
pollution
surged
to
severe
and
emergency
levels
with
authorities
showing
little
sign
of
finding
new
solutions
to
the
crisis
the
air
quality

the
central
pollution
control
board
showing
the
concentration
of
poisonous
particulate
matter
known
as
pm
stood
at
up
from
on
wednesday
and
about
times
the
government
recommended
level
of
pollution
levels
hit
in
some
parts
of
new
delhi
with
very
poor
visibility
in
some
areas
last
year
the
high
was
on
climatic
conditions
have
contributed
to
the
crisis
but
let
s
admit
that
most
steps
announced
in
have
failed
miserably
said
sunil
dahiya
a
senior
campaigner
with
environmental
group
greenpeace
a
sharp
drop
in
temperatures
and
wind
speed
combined
with
vehicle
and
industrial
emissions
dust
from
building
sites
and
smoke
from
garbage
burning
has
boosted
pollution
over
much
of
north
india
including
new
delhi
home
to
more
than
million
a
spokesman
for
the
federal
government
was
not
immediately
available
to
comment
the
city
government
refused
to
comment
both
the
federal
government
of
prime
minister
narendra
modi
and
arvind
kejriwal
s
delhi
government
have
not
announced
any
measures
to
fight
pollution
this
year
cold
weather
has
forced
some
people
especially
those
spending
the
night
in
the
open
to
burn
small
fires
to
keep
warm
adding
to
the
smog
unfavorable
weather
conditions
have
worsened
the
crisis
but
government
measures
have
also
failed
to
improve
air
quality
in
new
delhi
and
elsewhere
as
pollution
spiked
in
the
city
in
october
and
november
the
government
adopted
measures
ranging
from
a
temporary
ban
on
construction
activities
and
garbage
burning
to
a
clampdown
on
polluting
industrial
plants
such
as
power
stations
critics
say
the
measures
were
inadequate
and
poorly
implemented
largely
because
of
a
lack
of
resources
and
political
will
to
fight
the
toxic
air
which
has
driven
a
spurt
in
patients
battling
health
issues
india
is
home
to
the
world
s
most
polluted
cities
with
delhi
the
sixth
worst

health
organization

in
a
report

this

india
cuts
a
sorry
figure
because
of
the
reports
from
international
bodies
said
dahiya
if
a
country
fails
to
give
clean
air
to
its
people
