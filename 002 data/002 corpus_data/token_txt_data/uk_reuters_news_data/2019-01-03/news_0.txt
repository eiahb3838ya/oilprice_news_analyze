the
zone
known
as
the
area
within
days
the
dispute
over
the
zone
s
oil
and
its
price
dates
back
years
to
when
the
brazilian
government
granted
petrobras
the
right
to
extract
billion
barrels
of
oil
and
gas
in
the
offshore
santos
basin
while
parts
of
the
government
and
the
company
have
each
claimed
to
be
owed
billions
of
dollars
based
on
disputed
readings
of
a
contract
covering
the
area
the
ministry
of
mines
and
energy
has
now
agreed
that
brazil
will
pay
petrobras
to
settle
the
matter
albuquerque
s
comments
were
the
strongest
signal
yet
that
the
government
of
president
jair
bolsonaro
who
took
office
on
is
serious
about
resolving
the
disagreement
which
could
result
in
a

worth
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
if
settled
petrobras
will
be
the
creditor

to
focus
on
oil
exploration
and
production
and
begin

the
refining
and
natural
gas
sectors
the
firm
s
current
domination
of
the
natural
gas
production
and
supply
chain
in

is
bad
for

speech
the
liberal
economist
s
criticism
of
petrobras
domestic
near
monopoly
in

a
priority

the
major
planned
divestments

a
complex

gas
pipelines

as
tag
and
a
group
of
four
refineries
both
of
which
would
fetch
several
billion
dollars
if
sold
while
castello
branco
said
that
petrobras
current
plan
which
foresees
billion
in
divestments
is
very
good
in
principle
he
added
that
the
company
s
incoming
administration
will
need
to
examine
if
changes
are
needed
the
firm
would
double
down
on
exploration
and
production
he
said
calling
petrobras
exploration
potential
what
s
important
is
being
strong
not
gigantic

reiterated
that
the
bolsonaro
government

no
plans
