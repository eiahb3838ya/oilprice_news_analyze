fear
became
the
dominant
sentiment
in
especially
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
as
growing
pessimism
about
the
future
gripped
policymakers
business
leaders
investors
and
journalists
those
best
able
to
articulate
amplify
and
exploit
concerns
about
the
economy
migration
security
and
the
impact
of
technology
proved
the
most
influential
fear
can
be
a
powerful
motivating
force
but
it
is
not
a
particularly
creative
one
fear
is
the
fear
is
the
that
brings
total
obliteration
frank
herbert
wrote
in
his
novel
dune
and
willingness
to
invest
under
conditions
of
uncertainty
are
critical
to
sustaining
output
growing
the
economy
and
raising
real
incomes
if
human
nature
felt
no
temptation
to
take
a
chance
no
satisfaction
profit
apart
in
constructing
a
factory
a
railway
a
mine
or
a
farm
there
might
not
be
much
investment
merely
as
a
result
of
cold
calculation
john
maynard
keynes
wrote
in
s
general
theory
of
employment
interest
and
money
as
fear
drives
the
global
economy
towards
a
slowdown
or
outright
recession
politicians
business
leaders
investors
journalists
and
voters
will
have
to
find
reasons
to
become
more
optimistic
if
the
threatened
slump
is
to
be
averted
or
at
least
not
prolonged
the
rising
influence
of
china
and
its
shifting
balance
of
power
with
the
united
states
was
one
particular
area
of
concern
in
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
two
countries
were
embroiled
in
a
conflict
covering
trade
intellectual
property
foreign
investment
technology
transfer
and
espionage
as
well
as
an
accelerating
arms
race
strategic
competition
intensified
globally
from
the
pacific
and
indian
oceans
to
africa
latin
america
central
asia
and
europe
as
well
as
in
multilateral
institutions
including
the
imf
world
bank
apec
and
wto
the
two
superpowers
appeared
to
be
heading
towards
a
new
cold
war
in
which
the
globalised
economy
of
the
and
would
be
sundered
into
separate
and
competing
economic
diplomatic
and
military
blocs
a
proliferation
of
tariffs
and
barriers
intended
to
protect
national
and
economic
security
was
born
from
worries
about
the
impact
of
international
trade
on
domestic
manufacturing
industries
and
employment
policymakers
as
well
as
academics
stipulated
that
trade
should
be
fair
as
well
as
free
with
optimism
about
the
benefits
of
globalisation
countered
by
renewed
calls
to
strengthen
the
concerns
grew
about
income
inequality
poor
productivity
and
rural
areas
of
advanced
economies
by
economic
and
social
changes
by
the
end
of
the
year
commentators
as
well
as
politicians
were
invoking
nationalism
patriotism
and
a
bigger
role
for
democratic
governments
as
part
of
a
broad
backlash
against
unaccountable
multilateralism
technology
became
something
to
be
feared
for
its
negative
impact
on
existing
industries
rather
than
a
positive
force
for
productivity
and
social
and
economic
change
journalists
and
politicians
focused
on
the
disruptive
effect
of
internet
platforms
social
media
data
collection
and
artificial
intelligence
on
incumbent
businesses
and
workers
now
also
including
professionals
social
media
was
blamed
for
intensifying
political
polarisation
and
spreading
propaganda
rather
than
hailed
as
an
agent
for
reform
and
democratisation
with
growing
calls
for
government
regulation
of
various
platforms
china
s
leading
technology
exporters
zte
and
huawei
bore
the
brunt
of
a
backlash
as
the
worries
about
technology
intersected
concerns
about
the
security
of
global
supply
chains
surveillance
and
hacking
by
russia
china
iran
north
korea
saudi
arabia
israel
and
the
united
states
among
others
along
with
private
security
companies
and
criminal
organisations
added
to
the
jittery
mood
the
middle
east
became
less
rather
than
more
stable
in
with
an
intensifying
dispute
between
saudi
arabia
and
iran
tensions
between
qatar
and
its
neighbours
and
the
ongoing
war
in
yemen
the
withdrew
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
sweeping
sanctions
on
the
country
ratcheting
up
tensions
and
leaving
the
future
of
the
accord
unclear
previous
optimism
about
saudi
arabia
s
modernisation
programme
was
quashed
by
concerns
about
the
country
s
leadership
following
the
detention
of
domestic
critics
and
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
in
europe
inconclusive
brexit
negotiations
dominated
the
political
outlook
along
with
violent
protests
in
france
and
the
ebbing
political
authority
of
germany
s
leader
angela
merkel
italy
elected
an
avowedly
populist
government
determined
to
confront
the
eu
while
there
were
concerns
about
judicial
independence
press
freedom
and
authoritarianism
in
parts
of
eastern
europe
voters
continued
to
desert
moderate
and
politicians
to
back
parties
and
movements
with
more
radical
agendas
leading
to
fears
about
the
eu
s
future
direction
stability
and
cohesion
meanwhile
the
united
states
and
its
european
allies
continued
to
complain
about
russia
s
military
intervention
in
syria
and
ukraine
along
with
its
missile
programmes
and
cyber
activities
given
the
unpredictable
environment
and
the
prospect
of
rising
interest
rates
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
major
equity
markets
and
commodity
prices
fell
sharply
towards
the
end
of
the
year
the
s
p
equity
index
posted
its
worst
performance
since
february
and
before
that
sept
ending
last
year

lower
south
korea
s
index
which
is
heavily
exposed
to
world
trade
ended
down
percent
in
its
worst
performance
since
may
despite
the
worries
world
trade
has
held
up
reasonably
well
so
far
with
volumes
up
percent
in
the
three
months
from
august
to
october
compared
with
the
same
period
a
year
earlier
growth
has
moderated
but
is
not
yet
showing
the
sharp
slowdown
anticipated
by
global
equity
markets
however
some
indicators
paint
a
gloomier
picture
in
hong
kong
the
world
s
busiest
air
freight
hub
seen
as
a
leading
indicator
for
world
trade
air
freight
volumes
fell
percent
in
the
period
compared
with
a
year
earlier
the
worst
performance
since

china
s
economy
also
appears
to
have
been
slowing
since
the
middle
of

by
tighter
credit
the
tariffs
imposed
by
the

states
and
an
increasingly
uncertain
outlook

manufacturers

a
significant
decline
in

activity
in
december
with
the
composite

index
falling
to
just
its
lowest
level
since
february
and
below
the
threshold
dividing
economic
expansion
from
contraction
mirroring
the
slide
in
global
equity
markets
brent

the
year
almost

lower
the
worst
performance
since
june
and
the

remains
in
a
small
but
significant
contango
most
traders
expect
the
oil
market
to
remain
modestly
oversupplied
in
as
worries
about
the
impact
of
a
slowing
economy
on
consumption
outweigh
the
impact
of
