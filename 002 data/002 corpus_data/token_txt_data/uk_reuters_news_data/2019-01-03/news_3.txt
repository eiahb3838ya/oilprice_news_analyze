southern
california
s
gas
utility
on
thursday
extended
its
request
for
consumers
to
reduce
natural
gas
use
through
the
weekend
to
avoid
straining
the
system
as
cold
weather
lingers
over
the
area
regional
gas
supplies
were
expected
to
remain
tight
this
winter
due
to
limitations
on
several
southern
california
gas
co
socalgas
pipelines
and
reduced
availability
of
the
utility
s
biggest
storage
field
at
aliso
canyon
in
los
angeles
following
a
massive
leak
between
october
and
february
socalgas
a
unit
of
california
energy
company
sempra
energy
said
it
pulled
gas
from
all
four
of
its
storage
fields
during
the
cold
this
week
including
aliso
canyon
when
aliso
canyon
returned
to
service
after
the
leak
the
state
mandated
the
facility
was
only
to
be
used
as
an
asset
of
last
resort
to
maintain
system
reliability
after
other
storage
facilities
and
pipelines
have
been
exhausted
without
withdrawals
from
aliso
canyon
increased
demand
may
have
resulted
in
further
curtailments
to
customers
socalgas
said
in
a
customer
notice
customers
include
electric
generators
and
some
large
industrial
businesses
the
national
weather
service
issued
a
freeze
warning
for
some
inland
cities
in
southern
california
like
riverside
in
addition
to
asking
consumers
to
reduce
gas
used
to
heat
homes
and
businesses
socalgas
also
extended
a
voluntary
curtailment
notice
to
electric
generators
from
wednesday
through
friday
consumer
gas
demand
was
expected
to
reach
billion
cubic
feet
bcf
on
thursday
bcf
on
friday
and
bcf
on
saturday
and
sunday
after
hitting
bcf
on
wednesday
one
billion
cubic
feet
is
enough
to
supply
about
million
homes
for
a
day
state
agencies
forecast
socalgas
pipelines
and
storage
facilities
could
send
out
up
to
billion
cubic
feet
per
day
bcfd
this
winter
before
the
utility
would
have
to
tap
aliso
canyon
according
to
a
report
in
october
socalgas
can
get
about
bcfd
from
its
pipes
and
the
rest
from
storage
depending
on
how
many
pipeline
outages
and
reductions
the
utility
is
able
to
fix
according
to
a
state
report
if
needed
aliso
canyon
can
deliver
around
bcfd
but
like
all
storage
facilities
the
amount
of
gas
it
can
deliver
will
decline
rapidly
as
pressure
in
the
cavern
decreases
when
the
utility
pulls
fuel
out
