at
least
five
years
data
from

and
market

show
oil

to
the

fell
to
million
barrels
per

bpd
last
month
down
from
million
bpd
in
november
and
million
bpd
in
october
the
data
show
saudi
arabia
the
biggest
producer
in
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
several
others
curbed
supplies
in
the
face
of
rising
production
and
inventories
analysts
said
some
of
it
was
a
decline
in
opec
production
said
andy
lipow
president
of
lipow
oil
associates
in
houston
but
they
re
facing
competition
from
shale
and
canadian
opec
and
allies
including
russia
agreed
last
month
to
cut
crude
production
beginning
this
month
by
million
bpd
following
a
strategy
to
support
prices
when
supplies
overwhelm
demand
opec
pumped
million
bpd
last
month
according
to
a
reuters
survey
down
bpd
from
november
suggesting
some
members
moved
to
reduce
supplies
ahead
of
the
recent
accord
historically
saudi
arabia
has
utilized
crude
export
flows
to
the
united
states
as
a
method
of
signaling
the
kingdom
s
intentions
given
the
transparency
of
the
market
said
reid
i
anson
an
energy
economist
at
kpler
vessels
last
month
carried
about
bpd
from
saudi
arabia
to
the
united
states
down
from
bpd
in
november
algeria
sent
bpd
down
bpd
and
nigeria
shipped
bpd
down
by
bpd
according
to
kpler
one
major
exception
to
the
decline
was
iraq
which
sent
bpd
to
the
united
states
up
by
bpd
from
november
shipments
from
venezuela
increased
bpd
booming
shale
production
and
growing
stockpiles
also
crimped
the
nation
s
appetite
for
imported
crude
commercial
crude
stocks
rose
to
million
barrels
in
the
week
ended
up
from
million
barrels
in
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
when
inventories
began
rising
that
started
to
help
decrease
the
demand
for
imports
said
gene
mcgillian
vice
president
of

research
at

energy
in
stamford
connecticut
we
could
see
even
lower
imports
