stock
futures
fell
on
thursday
after
a
rare
revenue
warning
from
apple
inc
added
to
worries
about
slowing
global
growth
but
a
move
by
china
s
central
bank
to
help
struggling
smaller
firms
lifted
shares
there
cushioning
losses
for
asian
markets
the
cupertino
tech
giant
blamed
fewer
iphone
upgrades
and
slowing
sales
in
china
in
warning
about
revenues
in
its
most
recent
quarter
its
first
such
warning
since
its
shares
tumbled
percent
in
trade
the
news
also
sparked
a
flash
crash
in
currency
markets
as
investors
rushed
to
less
risky
assets
with
the
japanese
yen
soaring
against
most
major
currencies
in
a

of
seconds

after
a
bruising
wednesday
session
china
s
central
bank
said
late
on
wednesday
it
was
adjusting
policy
to
benefit
more
small
firms
which
are
having
trouble
obtaining
financing
in
its
latest
move
to
support
the
cooling
economy
the
step
is
aimed
at
getting
banks
of
all
sizes
to
lend
to
smes
through
offering
incentives
and
is
part
of
the
government
s
pledge
to
support

chinese
authorities
have
got
the
luxury
of
having
control
not
just
of
the
fiscal
parts
of
the
government
s
tool
case
but
also
the
monetary
parts
of
the

research
asia
at

what
s
going
on
right
now
between
the

china
a
lot
of
this
is
not
just
about
trade
a
lot
of
it
is
about
soft
power
and
the
stock
market
is
an
instrument
of
soft
power
and
if
the
chinese
authorities
are
able
to
to
influence
the
value
of
the
stock
market
they
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
make
sure
that
that
happens

concerns
about
the
state
of
the

the
