the
slump
in
china
s
purchasing
managers
index
pmi
is
likely
to
prove
an
unwelcome
new
year
s
gift
to
the
world
s
major
exporters
of
bulk
commodities
such
as
iron
ore
and
coal
the
manufacturing
gauge
compiled
by
beijing
s
national
bureau
of
statistics
dropped
to
in
december
dropping
below
the
that
demarcates
growth
from
contraction
for
the
first
time
since
july
the
outcome
was
also
below
the
median

china
pmi
vs
iron
ore
coal
prices
the
problem
for
iron
ore
and
coal
producers
shipping
to
the
world
s
biggest
commodity
importer
is
that
the
pmi
has
a
strong
correlation
to
prices
once
a
lag
of
a
month
or
two
is
factored
in
the
chinese
pmi
showed
a
solid
uptrend
from
july
to
a
peak
of
in
september
a
period
that
coincided
with
gains
for
the
prices
of
iron
ore
and
thermal
coal
iron
ore
with
a
iron
content
for
delivery
to
china
as
assessed
by
argus
media
almost
doubled
in
price
from
june
to
a
peak
of
a
tonne
in
february
thermal
coal
at
australia
s
newcastle
port
as
assessed
by
argus
media
also
enjoyed
a
strong
run
from
june
to
november
of
that
year
more
than
doubling
to
reach
a
peak
of
a
tonne
both
coal
and
iron
ore
reverted
to
the
usual
seasonal
pattern
of
peaks
in
the
northern
hemisphere
winter
and
troughs
in
the
summer
but
prices
remained
above
the
lows
a
slowing
in
the
chinese
pmi
to
in
february
was
matched
by
lower
iron
ore
and
coal
prices
by
march
but
a
recovery
in
the
pmi
to
by
may
saw
iron
ore
prices
stabilise
and
coal
prices
regain
strength
the
issue
for
iron
ore
and
coal
exporters
such
as
australia
brazil
indonesia
and
south
africa
is
that
the
chinese
pmi
is
now
in
an
established
downtrend
having
peaked
in
may
last
year
and
fallen
every
month
since
apart
from
a
slight
bump
in
august
iron
ore
and
coal
have
both
managed
to
hold
up
relatively
well
in
that
period
especially
considering
the
rout
in
other
commodities
such
as
crude
oil
newcastle
coal
did
retreat
from
its
high
of
a
tonne
reached
in
july
last
year
but
it
only
fell
as
far
as
in
late
november
and
has
since
then
actually
managed
to
move
higher
to
in
the
week
ended
iron
ore
in
contrast
to
the
pmi
climbed
for
most
of
the
second
half
of
reaching
as
high
as
a
tonne
in
early
november
before
dropping
to
by
the
end
of
the
month
however
since
then
similar
to
coal
iron
ore
has
managed
to
stage
a
little
rally
closing
at
a
tonne
on
wednesday
there
are
drivers
of
the
iron
ore
and
coal
price
that
can
outweigh
a
correlation
with
the
pmi
these
include
winter
peak
demand
for
coal
and
restocking
by
steel
mills
ahead
of
the
lifting
of
china
s
winter
pollution
controls
but
it
also
appears
that
for
iron
ore
and
coal
much
of
the
recent
resilience
in
prices
is
built
on
the
hope
that
beijing
will
open
the
stimulus
taps
and
boost
and
industries
such
as
infrastructure
and
construction
the
optimistic
view
in
the
market
is
that
the
authorities
will
do
what
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
economic
growth
remains
above
percent
in
china
a
level
that
seems
to
be
taking
on
some
sort
of
iconic
status
as
a
line
in
the
sand
that
beijing
will
defend
even
at
the
risk
of
creating
more
credit
problems
from
unrestrained
spending
it
may
yet
be
the
case
that
china
does
successfully
stimulate
its
economy
or
it
may
get
a
boost
if
its
trade
dispute
with
the
united
states
is
resolved
in
the
coming
months
but
unless
there
is
some
evidence
to
back
up
the
optimistic
scenario
iron
ore
and
coal
prices
would
seem
increasingly
likely
to
weaken
in
line
with
the
pmi
