column-u.s. economy flashes warning signs of impending slowdown: kemp
london
reuters
manufacturers
reported
the
broadest
slowdown
in
growth
last
month
for
more
than
a
decade
as
the
trade
conflict
with
china
falling
equity
prices
and
increasing
uncertainty
finally
started
to
take
a
toll
on
the
economy
the

chartbook
manufacturers
reported
increases
in
orders
output
employment
and
inventories
indicating
the
sector
continues
to
expand
but
at
a
much
slower
rate
than
before
according
to
survey
results
published
on
thursday
the
new
orders
component
slumped
by
points
and
remained
barely
above
the
threshold
that
divides
expanding
activity
from
a
contraction
suggesting
the
loss
of
momentum
could
extend
into
early
major
equity
indices
have
been
trending
lower
for
months
suggesting
investors
were
anxious
about
the
earnings
outlook
even
as
the
purchasing
managers
survey
continued
to
point
to
strong
expansion
that
contradiction
has
now
been
resolved
with
the
decline
in
the
survey
results
confirming
the
signal
coming
from
the
equity
markets
until
recently
the
united
states
had
appeared
immune
to
the
slowdown
in
growth
evident
in
most
other
major
economies
since
the
middle
of
but
the
loss
of
momentum
reported
at
the
end
of
last
year
shows
the
economy
is
not
immune
from
broader
global
trends
the
slowdown
in
the
united
states
is
consistent
with
other
indicators
suggesting
a
significant
deceleration
in
global
export
orders
and
trade
flows
oil
prices
and
calendar
spreads
have
been
falling
since
october
as
traders
anticipate
weaker
consumption
growth
in
through
tariffs
sanctions
and
other
actions
that
have
heightened
uncertainty
for
businesses
policymakers
have
taken
the
expansion
for
granted
and
pushed
the
global
economy
to
the
brink
of
a
slowdown
unless
they
reverse
course
and
start
adopting
a
more
approach
a
further
global
slowdown
or
even
a
recession
is
more
likely
than
not
