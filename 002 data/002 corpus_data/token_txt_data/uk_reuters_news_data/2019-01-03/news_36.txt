deadly
disputes
over
land
and
indigenous
rights
are
not
obvious
themes
for
children
s
books
but
indian
writers
are
using
conflicts
to
help
the
next
generation
understand
their
impact
on
communities
across
the
country
i
will
save
my
land
by
rinchin
is
about
the
impact
of
coal
mining
on
a
village
while
siddhartha
sarma
s
year
of
the
weeds
novel
for
young
adults
is
based
on
a
successful
fight
to
save
indigenous
land
from
a
mining
company
when
people
are
displaced
from
their
land
children
are
also
affected
but
perhaps
no
one
explains
it
to
them
said
rinchin
who
goes
by
one
name
and
published
her
book
last
year
in
rinchin
s
picture
book
a
little
girl
named
mati
asks
her
father
and
grandmother
for
her
own
piece
of
land
in
the
field
where
they
work
she
tends
to
her
plot
until
she
hears
that
they
will
lose
their
land
to
a
coal
mine
it
is
a
common
occurrence
said
rinchin
in
the
central
indian
state
of
chhattisgarh
where
coal
mining
has
forced
tens
of
thousands
of
farmers
off
their
land
many
of
whom
are
adivasis
or
indigenous
people
while
indigenous
people
have
customary
rights
over
ancestral
land
and
forests
the
state
can
acquire
the
land
for
infrastructure
and
development
projects
those
displaced
are
rarely
consulted
or
compensated
activists
say
last
week
in
a
rare
move
the
newly
elected
government
in
chhattisgarh
said
it
would
give
back
land
taken
from
indigenous
farmers
for
a
steel
plant
more
than
a
decade
ago
but
never
used
an
adivasi
s
right
over
land
is
so
tenuous
it
can
be
taken
away
at
any
time
by
the
government
or
an
person
said
rinchin
whose
books
are
also
translated
into
regional
languages
the
story
also
highlights
the
role
of
caste
and
gender
in
land
rights
issues
she
said
women
do
so
much
of
the
work
but
have
so
little
say
rinchin
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
women
make
up
nearly
half
the
agricultural
labour
in
india
yet
own
less
than
percent
of
its
farmland
according
to
the
think
tank
national
council
of
applied
economic
research
about
disputes
over
land
have
forced
millions
of
people
from
their
farms
across
india
according
to
the
research
organisation
land
conflict
watch
movies
and
children
s
books
are
focusing
on
such
issues
that
bollywood
films
and
mass
paperbacks
generally
ignore
in
year
of
the
weeds
also
published
last
year
sarma
tells
the
story
of
the
dongria
kondh
tribe
in
odisha
state
which
managed
to
stop
vedanta
resources
from
mining
bauxite
in
the
sacred
niyamgiri
hills
residents
of
villages
whose
opinion
the
state
sought
for
a
court
order
in
unanimously
voted
against
allowing
mining
it
was
a
rare
positive
story
and
i
decided
to
write
it
for
teenagers
because
i
still
have
hope
that
the
younger
generation
will
engage
with
these
issues
and
grow
up
to
be
kinder
gentler
more
humane
citizens
