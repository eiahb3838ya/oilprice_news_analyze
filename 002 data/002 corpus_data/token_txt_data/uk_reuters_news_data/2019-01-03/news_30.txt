renewables
overtook
coal
as
germany
s
main
source
of
energy
for
the
first
time
last
year
accounting

over
percent

renewables
to
provide
percent

a
costly
transition

abandons

power
by

is
devising
plans
for
an
orderly
exit
from

the
research
from
the
fraunhofer
organization
of
applied
science
showed
that
output
of
solar
wind
biomass
and
hydroelectric
generation
units
rose
percent
last
year
to
produce
terawatt
hours
twh
of
electricity
that
was
out
of
a
total
national

production
of

derived
from
both
green

fossil
fuels
of

coal
burning

bruno
burger
author
of
the
fraunhofer
study
said
it
was
set
to
stay
above
percent
this
year
we
will
not
fall
below
the
percent
in
because
more
renewable
installations
are
being
built
and
weather
patterns
will
not
change
that
dramatically

green
power
skeptics
say
that
output
merely
reflects
favorable
weather
patterns
and
does
not
prove
the
sector

contribution
to

supplies
solar
power
increased
by
percent
to
