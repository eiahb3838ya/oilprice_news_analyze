brazil
s
petrorio
sa
and
australia
s
karoon
energy
ltd
are
among
the
bidders
for
a
mature
shallow
water
oilfield
owned
by
petroleo
brasileiro
sa
according
to
two
sources
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
as
the
oil
major
marches
ahead
with
an
ambitious
divestment
program
with
oil
production
of
about
barrels
per
day
the
bauna
field
in
brazil
s
santos
basin
is
among
the
largest
mature
production
assets
in
petrobras
billion
divestment
portfolio
while
the
sources
did
not
disclose
a
potential
value
petrorio
had
previously
placed
a
bid
of
about
million
for
bauna
in
that
was
ultimately
unsuccessful
oil
prices
have
increased
moderately
since
then
the
slightly
more
productive
pampo
and
enchova
clusters
in
the
adjacent
campos
basin
which
are
being
sold
together
were
seen
as
fetching
bids
of
around
billion
in
june
karoon
and
petrobras
declined
to
comment
petrorio
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
one
of
the
sources
said
that
other
bidders
were
involved
in
the
auction
which
closed
late
last
year
and
it
was
possible
neither
petrorio
nor
karoon
would
emerge
as
the
winner
for
the
concession
set
to
last
through
petrobras
could
enter
exclusive
talks
with
one
of
the
bidders
in
a
matter
of
weeks
the
sources
said
this
is
the
second
time
petrorio
and
karoon
have
attempted
to
purchase
bauna
karoon
had
entered
into
exclusive
negotiations
in
to
purchase
bauna
as
well
as
the
tartaruga
verde
field
which
has
recently
started
producing
though
that
process
was
scuttled
following
a
court
injunction
karoon
at
that
time
beat
out
petrorio
s
million
bid
which
was
geared
strictly
toward
bauna
for
petrorio
the
asset
fits
well
with
the
independent
oil
firm
s
strategy
of
acquiring
stakes
in
mature
oil
fields
to
boost
their
productivity
for
karoon
which
has
said
that
it
remains
interested
in
bauna
the
asset
would
present
significant
synergies
with
its
nearby
kangaroo
and
echidna
oil
discoveries
petrobras
is
cutting
its
stakes
in
shallow
water
and
mature
fields
to
refocus
its
efforts
on
brazil
s
promising
deepwater
play
there
is
some
legal
uncertainty
hanging
over
the
bauna
divestiture
in
december
a
supreme
court
justice
suspended
sales
of
exploration
and
production
assets
by
petrobras
but
the
company
later
said
it
believed
that
decision
applied
only
to
processes
begun
in
may
or
later
