stock
futures
fell
and
asian
shares
wobbled
on
thursday
after
a
rare
revenue
warning
from
apple
inc
added
to
worries
about
slowing
global
growth
and
weaker
earnings
the
tech
giant
blamed
fewer
iphone
upgrades
and
slowing
sales
in
china
in
warning
about
revenues
in
its
most
recent
quarter
its
first
such
warning
since
its
shares
tumbled
percent
in
trade
the
news
sparked
a
flash
crash
in
currency
markets
as
investors
rushed
to
less
risky
assets
with
the
japanese
yen
soaring
against
most
major
currencies
in
a
matter
of
seconds
stock
futures
pointed
to
another
rough
start
on
wall
street
with
nasdaq

down
percent
and
s

off

msci
s
broadest
gauge
of
shares
outside
japan
fell
percent
after
an
early
attempt
at
a
bounce
japanese
markets
were
closed
for
holidays
but
nikkei
futures
dropped
percent
shares
in
china
and
hong
kong
between
gains
and
losses
as
investors
waited
for
beijing
to
roll
out
fresh
support
measures
for
the
cooling
chinese
economy
china
s
central
bank
said
late
on
wednesday
it
was
adjusting
policy
to
benefit
more
small
firms
that
are
having
trouble
obtaining
financing
in
its
latest
move
to
ease
strains
on
the
private
sector
a
key
job
creator
while
more
fiscal
and
monetary
policy
support
had
been
expected
in
coming
months
on
top
of
modest
measures
last
year
some
analysts
wonder
if
more
forceful
stimulus
will
be
needed
to
stabilise
the
world
s
economy
despite
a
more
policy
stance
effectively
since
we
expect
growth
to
continue
to
slow
in
the
foreseeable
future
as
it
appears
to
us
that
the
government
s
policy
is
still
behind
the
curve
economists
at
bofa
merrill
lynch
said
in
a
global
research
repport
in
our
view
the
next
significant
stimulus
may
only
occur
when
the
government
senses
that
financial
stability
is
in
apple
s
surprise
announcement
weighed
on
tech
shares
across
asia
most
notably
in
taiwan
and
south
korea
korean
shares
were
percent
lower
and
shares
in
taiwan
lost
percent
australia
bucked
the
trend
with
the
asx
bouncing
percent
after
the
previous
day
s
drubbing
a
sudden
slide
in
the
aussie
dollar
which
fell
to
near
decade
lows
at
one
point
boosted
shares
of
miners
and
other
resource
exporters
despite
the
weakening
china
demand
outlook
the
volatile
day
for
asian
markets
followed
swings
on
wall
street
overnight
where
shares
slid
in
early
trade
on
growth
worries
before
clawing
back
losses
as
surging
oil
prices
drove
gains
in
energy
shares
apple
specifically
highlighted
slowing
chinese
growth
and
trade
tensions
exacerbating
investors
concerns
about
the
health
of
the
global
economy
the
fall
in
the
em
manufacturing
pmi
last
month
was
fairly
and
supports
our
view
that
growth
in
the
emerging
world
as
a
whole
will
slow
this
year
gabriella
dickens
an
economist
at
capital
economics
said
in
a
note
adding
to
the
sour
mood
a
meeting
between
president
donald
trump
and
congressional
leaders
produced
no
agreement
to
end
a
partial
government
shutdown
trump
s
demand
for
billion
in
funding
for
a
wall

the
border
triggered
the
shutdown

about
a

the

a
wild

in
volatility
