opec
oil
supply
fell
in
december
by
the
largest
amount
in
almost
two
years
a
reuters
survey
found
as
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
made
an
early
start
to
a
accord
while
iran
and
libya
posted
involuntary
declines
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
pumped
million
barrels
per
day
last
month
the
survey
on
thursday
found
down
bpd
from
november
and
the
largest
drop
since
january
the
survey
suggests
saudi
arabia
and
some
of
its
allies
acted
unilaterally
to
bolster
the
market
as
crude
prices
slid
on
the
possibility
of
a
new
glut
a
formal
accord
by
opec
and
its
allies
to
cut
supply
in
took
effect
only
on
tuesday
oil
has
slid
to
a
barrel
from
a
high
of
in
october
on
signs
of
excess
supply
while
opec
has
not
ruled
out
further
action
officials
hope
prices
will
be
supported
by
further
output
declines
in
january
as
producers
implement
the
new
deal
naturally
it
will
adjust
from
now
on
said
an
opec
delegate
referring
to
the
downward
trend
in
production
i
hope
the
market
will
recover
opec
russia
and
other
an
alliance
known
as
agreed
in
december
to
reduce
supply
by
million
bpd
in
opec
s
share
of
that
cut
is
bpd
the
deal
came
just
months
after
an
accord
to
pump
more
oil
which
in
turn
partially
unwound
a
supply
cut
that
took
effect
in
the
drop
in
opec
output
in
december
is
the
largest
decline
since
january
the
first
month
of
the
earlier
deal
according
to
reuters
surveys
the
biggest
drop
in
opec
supply
last
month
came
from
saudi
arabia
and
amounted
to
bpd
the
survey
showed
saudi
supply
in
november
had
hit
a
record
million
bpd
after
president
donald
trump
demanded
more
oil
be
pumped
to
curb
rising
prices
and
make
up
for
losses
from
iran
the
kingdom
has
said
it
plans
to
go
even
further
in
january
by
delivering
a
larger
cut
than
required
under
the
deal
the
drop
occurred
in
the
united
arab
emirates
which
like
saudi
voluntarily
scaled
back
supply
the
survey
found
the
third
largest
was
an
involuntary
cut
by
libya
where
unrest
led
to
the
shutdown
of
the
country
s
biggest
oilfield
output
from
iran
declined
further
as
sanctions
discouraged
companies
from
buying
its
oil
according
to
industry
sources
however
iran
maintained
its
exports
helped
by
sanctions
waivers
granted
to
eight
buyers
as
well
as
dogged
iranian
efforts
to
keep
selling
crude
among
the
countries
boosting
output
the
biggest
increase
was
in
iraq
due
to
the
restart
of
kirkuk
crude
exports
and
a
rebound
in
shipments
from
the
country
s
southern
terminals
output
also
rose
in
kuwait
and
nigeria
an
opec
list
of
output
targets
seen
by
reuters
and
other
news
organisations
will
provide
a
basis
to
calculate
compliance
with
the
new
supply
deal
in
the
january
survey
as

opec

following
qatar
