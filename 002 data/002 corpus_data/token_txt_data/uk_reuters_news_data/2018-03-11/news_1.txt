a
temporary
exemption
from
tariffs
is
little
comfort
to
the
canadian
steel
city
of
hamilton
coping
with
months
of
uncertainty
as
president
donald
trump
has
threatened
a
potentially
devastating
percent
duty
unless
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
is
renegotiated
canadian
negotiators
are
weighing
the
interests
of
the
relatively
small
sector
responsible
for
about
direct
canadian
jobs
and
c
billion
billion
in
exports
against
those
of
bigger
industries
like
auto
manufacturing
and
politically
influential
groups
like
dairy
farmers
i
don
t
think
we
re
at
the
end
of
it
now
it
s
being
used
as
leverage

hamilton
port
authority
chief
executive

ian
hamilton
president

is
putting
a
lot
of
pressure
on
hamilton
population
has
pushed
to
diversify
its
economy
with
better
transit
links
to
toronto
and
affordable
homes
that
are
attracting
families
priced
out
of
canada
s
biggest
city
a
c
project
is
underway
to
clean
up
coal
tar
that
contaminates
the
harbor
and
condos

replacing
once
empty
downtown
storefronts
when
canadian
steel
escaped
steel
tariffs
in
the
duties
had
diverted
some
cheap
steel
into
canada
in
recent
years
a
global
steel
glut
has
made
it
difficult
for
canadian
mills
to
compete
but
arcelormittal

coking
and
finishing
operations
at
stelco
and
a
collection
of
smaller
operations
still
directly
employ
people
in
hamilton
the
north
american
steel
industry
is
heavily
integrated
with
raw
materials
steel
and
parts
crossing
the
border
several
times
before
a
finished
product
such
as
a
vehicle
or
refrigerator
is
sold
to
consumers
about
percent
of
the
hamilton
port
s
tonnage
is
iron

coal
used
to
make
steel

the
port
president
said
one
steel
company
called
after
trump
first
signaled
the
tariffs
on
march
when
it
was
unclear
whether
canada
would
be
exempt
at
all
the
firm
wanted
to
know
if
the
agency
might
be
willing
to
take
over
management
of
its
warehouse
and
find
different
cargo
to
fill
it
hamilton
chamber
of

president
keanin
loomis
a
former
washington
lawyer
is
part
of
a
new
generation
in
the
city
who
have
never
worked
in
a
steel
mill
but
like
much
of
the
city
he
has
a
personal
connection
to
steel
a
retired
from
the
dofasco
mill
if
a
tariff
is
imposed
loomis
expects
imports
to
lower
domestic
steel
prices
potentially
driving
some
employers
south
of
the
border
where
tariffs
are
expected
to
boost
prices
loomis
said
high
labor
costs
environmental
regulations
and
a
looming
carbon
tax
already
make
it
difficult
for
the
steel
industry
to
compete
this
could
be
the
thing
that
puts
it
over
the
edge
