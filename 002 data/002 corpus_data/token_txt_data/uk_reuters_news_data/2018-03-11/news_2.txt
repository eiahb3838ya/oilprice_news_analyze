reuters
germany
s
top
utilities
on
sunday
announced
plans
to
break
up
innogy
whose
assets
will
be
divided
among
parent
rwe
and
rival
in
the
sector
s
biggest
overhaul
since
a
landmark
move
to
exit
nuclear
power
the
deal
which
includes
making
a
billion
euro
billion
takeover
offer
to
innogy
s
minority
shareholders
spells
the
end
of
the
network
renewables
and
retail
energy
group
carved
out
from
rwe
two
years
ago
as
a
standalone
unit
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
decision
to
abandon
nuclear
power
after
japan
s
fukushima
nuclear
disaster
in
has
forced
the
sector
to
radically
restructure
in
order
to
survive
and
already
caused
major
plant
shutdowns
and
billions
of
euros
of
losses
peter
altmaier
the
next
economy
minister
and
a
close
ally
of
merkel
said
the
deal
was
a
consequence
of
that
shift
known
as
the
energiewende
in
german
the
companies
had
to
adapt
he
told
the
rheinische
post
newspaper
through
the
deal
which
includes
a
share
issue
and
asset
swaps
will
acquire
innogy
s
prized
regulated
energy
networks
and
customer
operations
while
rwe
will
take
on
the
renewables
businesses
of
both
and
innogy
that
would
position
rwe
which
relies
heavily
on
coal
and
power
plants
as
a
champion
of
the
shift
away
from
fossil
fuels
towards
a
more
sustainable
mix
of
energy
sources
rwe
kept
percent
of
innogy
after
the
a
source
involved
in
the
deal
said
it
would
be
slightly
more
beneficial
to
which
would
become
a
bigger
regulated
business
by
adding
more
networks
while
rwe
would
end
up
owning
interests
in
the
riskier
and
more
competitive
renewables
sector
the
source
said
that
had
been
in
a
better
bargaining
position
after
rwe
shopped
innogy
to
other
european
rivals
including
france
s
engie
italy
s
enel
and
spain
s
iberdrola
without
striking
a
deal
this
looks
like
an
advantageous
step
for
at
first
glance
said
thomas
deser
fund
manager
at
union
investment
which
holds
shares
in
rwe
and
innogy
through
the
renewable
pipeline
rwe
too
should
be
able
to
offset
its
dwindling
nuclear
and
lignite
business
as
well
as
attract
partners
for
the
expansion
of
its
wind
the
transaction
comes
less
than
two
years
after
and
rwe
both
split
up
their
businesses
to
separate
legacy
fossil
fuel
power
plants
from
more
promising
networks
and
renewable
assets
in
january
agreed
to
sell
a
remaining
percent
stake
in
its
power
plant
and
trading
unit
uniper
which
it
spun
off
in
to
finland
s
fortum
a
deal
expected
to
close
later
this
year
the
swap
will
also
hand
rwe
germany
s
biggest
electricity
producer
a
percent
stake
in
by
way
of
a
percent
capital
increase
rwe
will
pay
another
billion
euros
to
to
close
a
valuation
gap
that
results
from
the
complex
structure
of
the
asset
swaps
the
transactions
which
still
require
approval
from
the
company
s
boards
face
scrutiny
by
european
union
regulators
as
well
as
from
germany
s
federal
cartel
office
which
did
not
respond
to
an
emailed
request
for
comment
the
european
commission
declined
to
comment
innogy
