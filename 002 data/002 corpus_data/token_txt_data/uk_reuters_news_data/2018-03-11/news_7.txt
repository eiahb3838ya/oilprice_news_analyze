the
global

petrochemical

feedstock
to
produce
ethylene

other
basic
petrochemicals

the

we
see
relatively
little
impact
because
our
export
volume
to
the

not
that
much
however
in
the
long
term
we
should
be
prepared
for
global
trade
protectionism

the
potential
impact
of
plastic
usage
bans
on
the
petrochemical
industry

diversifying
our
