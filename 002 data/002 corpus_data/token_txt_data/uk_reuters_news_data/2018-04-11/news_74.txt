financial
markets
remained
fragile
on
wednesday
as
heightened
tensions
over
syria
and
sanctions
drove
russia
s
rouble
to
a
low
and
nagging
worries
about
a
trade
war
boosted
traditional

at
the
expense
of

many
of
europe
and

s
stock
markets
were
back
in
the
red
after
two
days
of

gold
was
up
for
a
fourth
session
though
it
was
the
hammering
of
russia
s
and
also
turkey
s
currencies
that
drew
most
attention
the
rouble
slumped
as
much
as
percent
against
the
dollar
and
almost
as
much
versus
the
euro
while
turkey
s
lira
tumbled
to
a
record
low
to
cement
its
record
as
one
of
the
world
s
worst
performers
this
year
the
fallout
from
biting
new
sanctions
on
moscow
continued
to
rattle
investors
and
fears
of
military
action
were
stoked
again
after
one
of
russia
s
ambassadors
reiterated
it
would
shoot
down
any
missiles

the

both
struck

open

watchers
said
the
announcement
may
further
ease

tensions
but
they
remained
cautious
noting
that
action
had
yet
to
be

pointing
out
that
foreign

still
face
unofficial
barriers
