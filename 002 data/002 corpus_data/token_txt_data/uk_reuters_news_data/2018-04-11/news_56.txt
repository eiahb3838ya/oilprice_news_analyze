airbus
chief
executive
tom
enders
said
on
wednesday
the
planemaker
expects
deliveries
of
narrowbody
jets
once
again
to
be
backloaded
towards
the
latter
part
of
the
year
possibly
even
more
so
than
before
due
to
ongoing
engine
issues
deliveries
have
been
delayed
by
delivery
and
quality
problems
on
engines
provided
by
pratt
whitney
and
most
recently
engines
from
venture
cfm
deliveries
have
been
suspended
both
engine
suppliers
for
airbus
narrowbody
jets
remain
stressed
but
airbus
whose
main
rival
is
boeing
is
sticking
by
a
target
of
delivering
some
aircraft
this
year
enders
said
we
are
quite
optimistic
they
can
meet
goals
but
it
is
not
going
to
be
a
walk
in
the
park
