financial
markets
lost
ground
on
wednesday
as
heightened
tension
over
syria
and
sanctions
drove
russia
s
rouble
to
a
low
and
boosted
safety
plays
at
the
expense
of
the
dollar
many
of
the
world
s
main
stock
markets
were
back
in
the
red
after
two
days
of
gains
gold
rose
for
a
fourth
session
though
it
was
the
hammering
of
russia
s
and
also
turkey
s
currencies
that
drew
most
attention
the
rouble
slumped
as
much
as
percent
against
the
dollar
and
even
more
versus
the
euro
turkey
s
lira
tumbled
to
a
record
low
maintaining
its
position
as
one
of
the
world
s
worst
performers
this
year
the
fallout
from
new
sanctions
on
moscow
continued
to
rattle
investors
and
fears
of
military
action
were
stoked
after
one
of
russia
s
ambassadors
reiterated
it
would
shoot
down
any
missiles
fired
at
syria
get
ready
russia
because
they
will
be
coming
president
donald

the

said
that
people
had
died
in
saturday
s
attack
on
douma
from
symptoms
consistent
with
exposure
to
highly
toxic
chemicals
and
more
than
in
all
had
been
treated
some
airlines
were
flights
after
europe
s
air
traffic
control
agency
warned
aircraft
flying
over
the
eastern
mediterranean
to
exercise
caution
because
of
possible
air
strikes
against
syria
we
are
more
neutral
today

chief
investment
officer
valentijn
van
niewenhuijzen
said
for
now
we
are
mainly
focusing
on
lowering
exposure
in
russia
and
having
a
more
cautious
stance
from
a
tactical
perspective
overall
on
asset
the
dollar
remained
near
lows
as
trade
war
worries
with
china
and
domestic
scandals
also
swirled
around
trump
markets
were
also
digesting
the
first
fall
in
inflation
in
months
which
will
feed
into
the
debate
on
when
the
federal
reserve
next
raises
interest
rates
the
dollar
index
versus
a
basket
of
six
major
peers
was
down
percent
at
and
within
sight
of
a
low
of

on
march
government

marks
any
major
cold
war
style
conflict
or
a
trade
battle
or
would
hit
the
world
economy
and
upset
the
plans
of
major
central
banks
to
tighten
policy
fuelling
demand
for
government
bonds
however
chinese
president
xi
jinping
and
trump
had
both
struck
conciliatory
tones
on
tuesday
boosting
hopes
the
door
to
trade
negotiations
might
open
but
one
report
said
early
talks
had
already
broken
down
the
risk
of
a
trade
war
poses
the
most
serious
risk
to
continued
strong
global
momentum
berenberg
senior
economist
kallum
pickering
said
he
said
he
doubted
there
would
be
a
major
further
escalation
at
this
point
wall
street
also
looked
set
for
a
softer
start
later
with
s
p
mini

down
percent
the
stoxx
index
was
last
down
percent
while
in
asia
overnight
japan
s
nikkei
and
australian
stocks
both
lost
percent
south
korea
s
kospi
dipped
percent
though
china
did
end
higher
shanghai
shares
fared
better
after
china
s
central
bank
set
out
the
clearest
timetable
yet
for
opening
financial
services
to
foreign
investors
it
will
allow
offshore
companies
to
enter
its
trust
financial
leasing
auto
finance
and

sectors
by
the
end
of

year
china
watchers
said
the
announcement
may
further
ease
trade
tensions
but
they
remained
cautious
noting
that
action
had
yet
to
be
taken
and
pointing
out
that
foreign
companies
still
face
unofficial
barriers
in
sectors
ostensibly
already
opened
up
back
among
the
major
currencies
the
yen
and
euro
were
both
a
shade
higher
at
yen
and
respectively
it
was
the
common
currency
s
fourth
session
of
gains
and
it
stayed
close
to
high

reached
overnight
after
european
central
bank
policymaker
ewald
nowotny
told
reuters
it
could
get
rate
hikes
rolling
once
its
programme
ends
this
year
the
euro
has
risen
about
percent
this
year
on
expectations
the
ecb
will
eventually
normalise
monetary
policy
and
raise
interest
rates
we
anticipate
