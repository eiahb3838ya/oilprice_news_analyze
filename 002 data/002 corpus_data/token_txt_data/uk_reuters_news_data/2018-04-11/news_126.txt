reuters
alberta
on
tuesday
doubled
down
on
its
pledge
to
financially
support
a
troubled
pipeline
expansion
saying
the
province
could
buy
the
project
outright
from
kinder
morgan
canada
ltd
as
canada
s
federal
government
reiterated
it
was
percent
behind
the
build
kinder
morgan
said
on
sunday
it
would
scrap
plans
to
nearly
triple
the
capacity
of
its
trans
mountain
pipeline
which
extends
from
alberta
to
british
columbia
s
coast
unless
various
legal
and
jurisdictional
challenges
could
be
resolved
by
may
the
ultimatum
prompted
swift
responses
from
alberta
and
ottawa
with
both
levels
of
government
signaling
interest
in
spending
public
funds
to
ensure
the
project
proceeds
shareholders
backed
the
gamble
we
are
considering
a
number
of
financial
options
to
ensure
that
the
trans
mountain
expansion
is
built
up
to
and
including
purchasing
the
pipeline
outright
if
it
was
to
come
to
that
premier
rachel
notley
said
in
a
statement
provided
to
reuters
notley
was
not
immediately
available
to
clarify
whether
she
was
referring
to
both
the
existing
pipeline
operations
and
the
c
billion
billion
expansion
project
or
just
the
latter
she
had
previously
said
alberta
could
take
a
stake
in
the
project
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
s
cabinet
held
meetings
on
tuesday
to
discuss
its
options
for
the
controversial
project
which
is
desperately
needed
by
industry
but
fiercely
opposed
by
the
province
of
british
columbia
along
with
certain
municipalities
and
aboriginal
groups
the
issue
is
a
major
political
challenge
for
trudeau
who
approved
the
expansion
in
critics
have
said
he
needs
to
be
more
forceful
with
both
the
west
coast
province
and
protesters
who
have
repeatedly
blocked
kinder
morgan
work
sites
we
ve
been
saying
for
the
last
two
days
we
re
prepared
to
look
at
many
options
and
that
has
not
changed
natural
resources
minister
jim
carr
told
reporters
in
brief
remarks
following
the
meeting
the
government
is
percent
behind
this
carr
had
previously
said
ottawa
was
looking
at
whether
to
take
a
stake
in
the
project
but
the
industry
was
less
enthusiastic
we
need
foreign
businesses
like
kinder
to
be
saying
we
are
an
enviable
place
to
do
business
in
not
a
place
that
i
had
to
sell
my
asset
to
the
government

kinder
morgan
canada
said
it
was
consulting
with
the
government
and
would
not
comment
until
those
talks
are
complete

tuesday
closing
up
percent
at

after
shedding
percent
the
day
before
whether
or
not
governments
step
up
with
financial
backing
the
company
s
struggles
are
another
black
mark
for
canada
which
used
to
be
a
prime
destination
for
foreign
investment
said
robert
skinner
executive
fellow
at
the

of

policy
university
of
calgary
we
used
to
wear
this
as
a
badge
of
honor
that
we
were
not
like
the
regimes
around
the
world
where
they
carry
kalashnikov
rifles
he
said
canada
ironically
has
become
a
high
