petro
said
in
an
interview
late
on
tuesday
the
core
generator
of
problems
in
colombia
is
the
election
may
determine
the
fate
of
colombia
s
fragile
peace
process
which
ended
of
war
with
marxist
farc
rebels
but
angered
many
by
giving
their
commanders
a
political
voice
instead
of
a
jail
cell
and
highlighted
the
wealth
divide
petro
is
targeting
petro
s
proposals
which
include
expanding
education
clean
energy
and
a
tax
overhaul
have
spooked
some
investors
who
fear
he
will
expropriate
land
and
turn
colombia
into
another
venezuela
a
charge
he
denied
we
would
not
be
an
ally
of
venezuela
because
venezuela
entered
the
world
of
the
fossil
economy
he
said
referring
to
colombia
s
socialist
neighbour
petro
added
that
he
would
gradually
eliminate
oil
coal
and
gas
and
replace
it
with
energy
from
clean
sources
like
wind
and
water
petro
will
hike
taxes
on
unproductive
fertile
land
encouraging
landowners
to
sell
to
the
state
to
pass
on
to
poor
farmers
that
may
upset
cattle
ranchers
among
others
a
tax
can
not
be
called
expropriation
it
s
a
tax
on
productive
land
he
said
once
a
member
of
the
rebel
group
petro
s
election
as
bogota
mayor
was
seen
as
proof
that
politics
was
the
way
forward
for
insurgent
movements
like
the
farc
which
demobilized
last
year
and
formed
a
political
party
but
in
late
he
was
removed
from
his
post
the
most
powerful
after
the
presidency
by
the
inspector
general
for
mismanagement
of
garbage
collection
and
banned
from
holding
office
for
years
a
ruling
that
brought
thousands
to
the
streets
and
was
later
overturned
ivan
duque
a
protege
of
former
president
alvaro
uribe
is
leading
petro
in
polls
by
about
points
in
colombia
a
country
of
million
that
has
historically
been
governed
by
the
right
a

petro
rails
against
the
colombian
traditional
political
class
accusing
it
of
corruption
and
enriching
itself
at
the
expense
of
the
poor
petro
s
colombia
humana
party
won
just
six
seats
out
of
in
the
recent
legislative
election
making
it
tough
for
him
to
push
radical
reforms
through
congress
he
said
he
would
seek
alliances
with
centre
left
and
other
minority
parties
or
call
for
a
change
to
the
constitution
through
a
constituent
assembly
he
plans
to
sell
bonds
to
finance
the
land
purchases
and
move
poor
farmers
like
those
who
grow
coca
the
raw
material
for
cocaine
to
grow
legal
crops
to
contain
the
fiscal
deficit
he
would
promote
another
tax
reform
to
raise
duties
on
corporate
dividends
and
foreign
profits
and
eliminate
tax
exemptions
for
large
investors
an
investor
is
a
gambler
and
the
first
thing
he
does
is
to
examine
the
rules
of
the
game
we
want
to
put
the
rules
of
the
game
on
the
table
without
hidden
cards
we
want
to
move
from
an
extractive
economy
to
a
productive
economy
he
said
a
ballot
will
be
held
on
may
but
if
none
of
the
candidates
get
more
than
half
the
votes
a
second
round
will
be
held
in
june
