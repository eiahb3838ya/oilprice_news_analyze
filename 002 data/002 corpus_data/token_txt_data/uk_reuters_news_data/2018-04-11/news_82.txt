want

to
unreasonable
levels

state
of
the
oil
market
opec
russia
and
several
other
producers
began
to
cut

in

in
an
effort
to
erase
a
global
glut
of
crude
that
had
built
up
since
they
have
extended
the
pact
until
the
end
of
i
think
a
lot
of
the
glut
has
been
cleared
said
falih
asked
if
he
was
happy
with
the
current
market
he
replied
yes
i
brent
crude
was
trading
above
a
barrel
on
wednesday
though
easing
away
from
the
highs
it
matched
in
the
previous
session
as
escalating
middle
east
tensions
were
offset
by
increasing
inventories
and
production

its
partners
meet
to
decide
oil
policy
in
june
and
next
week
a
ministerial
panel
gathers
to
review
the
market
the
remarks
from
falih
suggest
big
changes
in
the
supply
cut
agreement
look
unlikely
for
now
asked
if
india
a
major
consumer
would
be
happy
with
oil
at
a
barrel
falih
said
no
specific
price
was
aimed
for
and
he
was
concerned
about
declining
output
in
some
producing
countries
and
a
lack
of
investment
in
new
supplies
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
target
price
by
saudi
arabia
he
said
we
re
seeing
many
regions
declining
the
only
way
to
offset
this
is
for
the
financial
markets
to
start
financing
and
funding
upstream
i
don
t
know
what
is
the
price
that
will
provide
that
equilibrium
all
we
know
is
in
we
re
still
not
seeing
