software
first

is
part
of
a
digital
renaissance
underway

have
effectively
turned
semi

into
locator
beacons
for
shippers
who

their
freight
the
xpo
online
portal
lets
customers
shop
around

their
shipment
in

like
weather
delays
and
traffic

direct
to
homes
in
north
america
it
is
the
operator
truckers
that
consolidate
multiple
loads
on
a
single
truck
we
wanted
to
provide
visibility
across
all
of
our
transportation
modes
backed
by
data
analytics

said
about
merchants
and
carriers
were
testing
xpo
connect

develop
the
software
shows
xpo
s
capacity
not
the
overall
freight
market
during
one
of
the
tightest
freight
markets
in
years
xpo
connect
has
given
shippers
an
experience
similar
to
a
commuter
using
uber
s
app
to
see
available
cars
book
a
ride
and
send
friends
an
estimated
arrival
time
down
to
the
minute
companies
like
bain
fourkites
and
onfleet
have
already
launched
similar

shippers
manage
capacity
fluctuations
and
reduce
warehouse
logjams
when

spike
during

as
the

said
priya
rajagopalan
chief
product
officer
at
fourkites
whose
customers
include
hundreds
of
truckers
and
shippers
like
schneider
national
inc
and
kraft
heinz
foods
co
trucks
have
become
easier
to
trace
due
to
a
new
federal
regulation
requiring
truck
drivers
to
record
hours
on
the
road
using
electronic
logging
devices
some
of
which
are
the
expectation
that
we
as
consumers
have
a
very
clear
line
of
sight
into
exactly
when
anything
we
order
will
arrive
that
level
of
visibility
has
set
the
expectation
with
freight
customers
