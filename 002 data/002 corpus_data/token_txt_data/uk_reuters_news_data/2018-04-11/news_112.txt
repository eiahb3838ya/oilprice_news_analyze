analysis-cushing's oil market clout wanes amid u.s. export boom
new

reuters
the
volume
of
oil
sitting
in
steel
tanks
in
a
radius
in
cushing
oklahoma
has
long
been
a
key
barometer
for
the
health
of
crude
supply
and
the
nation
s
benchmark
for
daily
trading
of
billions
of
dollars
in
the
commodity
but
those
tanks
could
soon
drain
to
levels
near
effectively
empty
even
as
oil
production
soars
past
a
new
record
of
million
barrels
per
day
oil
supplies
have
fallen
before
in
cushing
for
a
variety
of
seasonal
or
reasons
but
this
time
there
is
no
shortage
of
crude
in
the
market
in
fact
production
is
straining
pipeline
and
storage
capacity
the
declining
volumes
stored
at
cushing
reflects
a
more
permanent
shift
underscoring
the
hub
s
waning
influence
as
the
primary
measuring
stick
for
the
oil
market
and
the
leading
barometer
of
future
supply
demand
and
prices
for
a
graphic
of
falling
oil
inventories
at
cushing
see
companies
are
now
spending
millions
of
dollars
building
infrastructure
to
facilitate
trading
and
storage
elsewhere
such
as
in
houston
and
other
gulf
coast
ports
that
could
pave
the
way
for
a
change
in
the
benchmark
oil
price
used
to
value
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
of
crude
and
futures
contracts
every
day
the
current
benchmark
called
west
texas
intermediate
crude
or
wti
has
been
derived
from
the
price
of
physical
oil
delivered
to
cushing
for
more
than
three
decades
traders
and
major
global
crude
buyers
have
advocated
replacing
wti
with
a
new
benchmark
futures
contract
that
would
reflect
the
value
of
crude
delivered
to
the
gulf
coast
the
price
of
oil
in
cushing
which
bills
itself
as
the
pipeline
crossroads
of
the
world
is
used
to
value
crude
grades
produced
around
the
united
states
and
some
oil
imported
from
canada
mexico
and
south
america
prices
at
the
hub
also
provide
the
basis
for
an
average
of
million
wti
futures
contracts
worth
about
billion
at
current
prices
that
change
hands
on
the
cme
group
s
new
york
mercantile
exchange
every
day
making
it
one
of
the
world
s
most
actively
traded
commodities
but
as
more
pipelines
are
built
to
take
oil
from
shale
fields
to
gulf
refineries
or
for
export
markets
much
of
the
crude
produced
in
the
giant
permian
basin
oilfield
in
texas
and
elsewhere
no
longer
passes
through
cushing
instead
producers
are
increasingly
shipping
directly
to
seaports
such
as
houston
where
vessels
carry
the
oil
to
dozens
of
countries
worldwide
that
reflects
a
major
transformation
in
global
crude
flows
since
the
united
states
lifted
a
ban
on
oil
exports
in
late
some
traders
and
buyers
argue
the
benchmark
needs
to
change
to
reflect
this
joshua

a

marketer
in
oklahoma
sees
the
benchmark
delivery
point
moving
south

the
direction
it
s
moving

said
as
opposed
to
importing
now
you
re
exporting
through
the
same
infrastructure
the
oil
capital
of
the
nation
is
in
inventories
in
cushing
fell
to
million
barrels
in
early
march
lowest
in
more
than
three
years
analysts
say
a
level
of
million
barrels
is
effectively
empty
that
s
because
tank
design
necessitates
a
minimum
volume
of
crude
be
kept
on
hand
to
maintain
the
physical
integrity
of
the
complex
and
to
allow
for
blending
different
crude
grades
to
comply
with
pipeline
specifications
there
has
been
a
major
structural
shift
in
crude
flows

i
think
cushing
is
rapidly
losing
its
a
way
station
cushing
got
its
distinction
in
the
early
when
tanks
sprung
up
to
store
oil
en
route
from
oklahoma
and
texas
to
major
metropolitan
areas
and
refineries
in
the
midwest
in
it
became
the
delivery
point
for
the
wti
futures
contract
because
the
relied
on
imports
and
banned
exports
cushing
was
key
for
traders
to
gauge
domestic
supply
trends
bp
s
former
head
of
crude
trading
donald
porteous
earned
the
nickname
the
king
of
cushing
because
of
his
deep
understanding
of
supply
logistics
in
the
oklahoma
town
a
strategy
that
often
earned
him
more
money
than

lately
permian

prices
have
declined
because
pipelines
can
t
be
built
fast
enough
to
get

as

added

greg

chief
executive
of

said
at
a
recent
industry
conference
projects
in
the
works
could
boost
outgoing

from

from
million
bpd
in

to
more

crude
line
to

from
illinois
to

gulf
for
now
traders
watch
the
price
differential
between
wti
and
brent
crude
to
determine
where
to
ferry
shipments
globally
but
traders
say
the
price
of
physical
trades
in
houston
is
growing
more
important
as
a
barometer
for
shippers
earlier
this
year
even
as
the
wti
crude
discount
to
brent
narrowed
houston
s
discount
to
brent
remained
steady
at
about
a
barrel
analysts
said
helping
buoy
export
demand
as
pipeline
capacity
to
the
gulf
has
increased
and
storage
has
expanded
demand
to
park
barrels
in
cushing

waned
said
carlin
conner
chief
executive
at
semgroup
corp
which
operates
about
million
barrels
of
crude
oil
storage
in
cushing
a
spokesman
for
magellan
midstream
partners
which
owns
about
million
barrels
of
cushing
storage
said
it
will
remain
important
because
of
its
connections
to
the
gulf
and
midwest
cushing
is
also
connected
via
pipeline
to
the
gulf
miles
to
the
south
and
can
offer
cheaper
storage
than
what
s
available
on
the
coast
said
semgroup
s
conner
i
believe
cushing
s
next
chapter
he
said
is
that
it
s
going
to
become
an
offsite
gulf
coast
storage
