oil
and
gas
producers
plan
to
some
of
their
production
even
as
higher
crude
prices
boost
their
ability
to
borrow
against
reserves
according
to
a
survey
of
energy
companies
and
financiers
on
tuesday
the
survey
found
percent
of
producers
saying
they
expect
to
tap
cash
flow
from
operations
for
capital
needs
this
year
a
higher
percentage
than
those
who
selected
debt
from
banks
and
equity
from
private
equity
firms
at
percent
and
percent
respectively
this
was
the
first
year
that
respondents
were
asked
about
the
public
companies
are
having
to
live
by
cash
flow
because
that
s
what
the
market
is
dictating

a
partner
at

firm
haynes
and
boone
which
conducted
the
survey
of

oilfield
services
companies
lenders

still

producers
can
expect
lenders
during
their
valuations
of
oil
and
gas
reserves
to
offer
more
capital
this
spring
according
to
the
survey
more
borrowing
power
from
crude
prices
up
percent
in
the
last
year
can
finance
greater
drilling
the
survey
found
that
more
than
percent
of
respondents
expect
their
borrowing
base
to
increase
with
most
expecting
it
to
rise
between
percent
and
percent
a
year
ago
less
than
percent
of
respondents
expected
their
borrowing
base
to
increase
percent
or
more
it
is
a
more
optimistic
survey
than
the
prior
year

clark
citing
the
improved
picture
for
commodity
pricing
and
access
to
private
financing
clark
said
more
capital
is
available
primarily
from
private
equity
firms
and
funds
at
the
same
time
initial
public
offerings
by
producers
have
declined
saying
ipo
work
at
the
firm
has
been
below
the
pace
of
borrowers
also
are
locking
in
more
of
their
future
production
using
hedges
that
insure
against
price
declines
respondents
have
locked
in
between
percent
and
