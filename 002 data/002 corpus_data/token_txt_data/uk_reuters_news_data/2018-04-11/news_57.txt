reuters
opec
oil
producers
and
their
partners
are
trying
to
work
out
a
structure
for
their
proposed
agreement
on
oil
supplies
the
energy
minister
for
the
united
arab
emirates
said
on
wednesday
suhail
also
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
the
international
energy
forum
in
india
that
the
agreement
may
not
include
a
provision
on
cutting
or
increasing
oil
output
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
russia
and
several
other
producers
began
to
cut
supply
in
january
in
an
effort
to
erase
a
global
glut
of
crude
that
had
built
up
since
opec
and
its
partners
have
extended
the
pact
until
the
end
of
and
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
told
reuters
last
month
that
riyadh
and
russia
were
considering
a
deal
to
extend
their
alliance
for
years
or
even
decades
we
are
now
trying
to
put
a
structure
or
a
term
sheet
or
a
charter
around
what
is
the
scope
of
the
group
mazroui
whose
country
holds
the
opec
presidency
this
year
told
reuters
the
talks
have
raised
the
prospect
that
producers
could
extend
tangible
actions
to
prop
up
oil
prices
through
supply
cuts
or
moderate
them
by
pumping
more
beyond
this
year
s
expiry
of
the
supply
cut
agreement
but
the
minister
asked
if
the
agreement
would
have
such
a
provision
said
it
was
not
yet
clear
no
we
need
to
wait
until
we
agree
with
everyone
what
is
going
to
be
the
charter
he
said
what
form
what
shape
we
re
not
ready
to
discuss
that
the
minister
reiterated
that
producers
aimed
to
draft
the
agreement
by
the
end
of
this
year
adding
that
it
wasn
t
a
target
to
do
this
at
the
next
opec
meeting
in
june
i
don
t
think
june
is
the
target
before
the
end
of
the
year
that
s
my
the
deal
has
reduced
excess
supply
and
helped
boost
prices
to
above
a
barrel
the
highest
since
but
mazroui
echoed
other
ministers
such
as
his
saudi
counterpart
in
saying
investment
in
new
supplies
was
too
low
we
will
know
what
will
be
the
good
price
when
the
market
is
balanced
and
we
have
enough
investments
he
said
we
need
to
have
more
investments
