london
reuters
varo
energy
cancelled
its
amsterdam
flotation
after
seeing
how
the
trade
dispute
had
roiled
global
markets
and
negatively
affected
other
european
initial
public
offerings
the
company
s
chief
executive
told
reuters
on
wednesday
varo
announced
the
cancellation
on
tuesday
afternoon
after
all
the
optimism
earlier
in
the
year
the
volatility
is
being
driven
by
recent
discussion
around
the
trade
war
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
the
and
china
leading
to
turbulences
in
the
market
which
have
had
an
impact
on
varo
s
planned
ipo
ceo
roger
brown
said
in
an
interview
the
european
downstream
company
has
refineries
and
storage
assets
in
western
europe
and
is
owned
by
oil
trading
giant

varo
announced
its
intention
to
sell
percent
of
combined
existing

in
march
banking
sources
at
the
time
said
the
firm
could
be
valued
at
around
billion
euros
billion
brown
said
the
investor
presentations
in
december
and
february
had
been
successful
but
then
the
market
became
volatile
intention
to
float
the
united
states
and
china
have
been
on
the
brink
of
a
trade
war
since
the
trump
administration
announced
in
early
april
a
proposed
percent
tariff
on
chinese
imports
worth
about
billion
in
retaliation
china
proposed
tariffs
on
imports
of
equal
value
but
global
markets
have
been
on
edge
since
early
march
when
washington
announced
import
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
that
took
effect
on
march
the
move
was
widely
viewed
as
designed
to
pressure
beijing
to
cut
excess
production
capacity
looking
at
a
number
of
recent
ipos
that
did
go
ahead
in
amsterdam
they
all
listed
at
the
bottom
of
their
ranges
and
then
yesterday
they
were
trading
at
or
below
their
offer
prices
he
said
dutch
bank
nibc
energy
group
alfen
and
wholesaler
b
s
group
were
among
those
that
were
negatively
impacted
when
they
started
trading
in
the
second
half
of
march
on
amsterdam
s
bourse
euronext
elsewhere
in
europe
the
stock
values
of
deutsche
bank
unit
dws
and
sweden
s
bygghema
which
listed
at
the
end
of
march
also
suffered
brown
said
the
company
would
revisit
the
possibility
of
a
float
but
there
was
no
timeframe
at
the
moment
we
re
not
in
a
hurry
to
list
the
company
we
will
continue
to
grow
through
m
a
and
organic
investments
brown
said
the
ipo
was
not
affecting
the
company
it
was
a
secondary
offering
shareholders
were
reducing
their
stake
it
would
give
us
further
financing
options
going
forward
but
there
s
nothing
urgent
at
the
moment
