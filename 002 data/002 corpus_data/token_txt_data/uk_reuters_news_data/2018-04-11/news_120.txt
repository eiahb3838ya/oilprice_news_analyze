asian
stocks
rose
modestly
on
wednesday
paring
earlier
gains
as
optimism
that
trade
ties
between
washington
and

were
on
the

to

between
beijing
and
washington
the

s
surge
lost
some
steam
however
with
some
asian
equity
markets
staggering
as

two

still
seen
needing

clear
more

over
trade
issues
the
united
states
and
china
are
still
at
a

the
intentions
of

go
the

its
fourth
session
of
gains
the

not
far
from
a
high
of

overnight
after
european
central
bank
policymaker
ewald
nowotny
told

elevated
after
steep

in
the
previous

as
the
commodity

eyed
an
escalation
of
