chinese
president
xi
jinping
and
president
donald
trump
both
struck
conciliatory
tones
on
tuesday
which
analysts
hoped
could
open
the
door
for
negotiations
to
avert
a
trade
war
but
one
report
said
early
talks
have
already
broken
down
adding
to
market
jitters
the
united
states
and
its
western
allies
are
reportedly
discussing
possible

index
of
shares
outside
japan
was
percent
higher
it
had
gained
percent
the
previous
day
on
relief
that
xi
s
speech
was
businesslike
and
but
lost
some
steam
on
wednesday
on
concerns
over
how
long
it
may
take
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
to
hash
out
a
compromise
on
trade
if
one
is
possible
the
united
states
and
china
are
still
at
a
phase
in
which
they
are
attempting
to
probe
the
intentions
of
the
other

masahiro
ichikawa

showed
how

it
can
go
the

until
the
two
powers
reach
an

how
the

australian
stocks
were
down
percent
and
japan
s
nikkei
lost
percent
south
korea
s

chinese
shares
fared
better
after
the
country
s
central
bank
set
out
the
clearest
timetable
yet
for
opening
the
financial
services
sector
to
foreign
investors
it

allow
offshore
firms
to
enter
its
trust
financial
leasing
auto
finance
and
consumer
finance
sectors
by
the
end
of
this
year
china
watchers
said
the
announcement
may
further
ease
trade
tensions
but
they
remained
cautious
however
noting
that
action
speaks
louder
than
words
and
pointing
out
that
foreign
companies
have
continued
to
face
unofficial
barriers
even
after
some
sectors
were
ostensibly
opened
up

the

the

open
up

told
reuters
in
an
interview
that

buying
program
would
be
wound
down
by
the
end
of
this
year
the
euro
has
risen
about
percent
this
year
on
expectations
that
the
ecb
would
eventually
normalise
monetary
policy
and
hike
interest
rates
we
anticipate
further
gradual
euro
appreciation
versus
the
dollar
over
the
course
of
