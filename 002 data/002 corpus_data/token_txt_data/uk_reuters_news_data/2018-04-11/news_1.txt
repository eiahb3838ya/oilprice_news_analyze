update 1-canada's trudeau to press british columbia to accept pipeline -source
reuters
canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
is
set
to
pile
pressure
on
british
columbia
s
provincial
government
to
drop
its
resistance
to
a
pipeline
project
but
will
try
to
avoid
tougher
measures
that
might
alienate
voters
who
helped
his
liberals
win
power
a
source
close
to
the
matter
said
on
wednesday
trudeau
is
racing
against
time
kinder
morgan
canada
said
it
would
scrap
the
c
billion
billion
trans
mountain
pipeline
expansion
from
alberta
to
the
west
coast
unless
all
legal
and
jurisdictional
challenges
facing
the
project
are
resolved
by
may
the
pipeline
which
canada
s
oil
industry
considers
crucial
is
opposed
by
british
columbia
s
new
democratic
provincial
government
environmentalists
and
aboriginal
activists
are
mounting
frequent
protests
and
british
columbia
police
have
arrested
about
people
around
trans
mountain
facilities
since
trudeau
s
liberals
picked
up
seats
in
the
province
in
the
last
election
but
the
federal
ndp
which
opposes
the
pipeline
remains
a
force
there
this
could
make
trudeau
s
federal
government
cautious
as
it
is
locked
in
a
rare
standoff
with
a
provincial
counterpart
british
columbia
opposes
the
expansion
citing
fears
that
the
risk
of
a
spill
in
the
pacific
province
is
too
great
ottawa
insists
it
has
jurisdiction
over
the
project
and
trudeau
is
under
huge
pressure
to
crack
down
for
now
he
will
press
the
provincial
government
pointing
to
polls
showing
most
canadians
want
the
expansion
to
go
ahead
we
need
to
take
actions
that
are
focused
on
the
government
of
british
columbia
said
the
source
who
requested
anonymity
given
the
sensitivity
of
the
situation
trudeau
will
hold
more
talks
with
the
province
as
well
as
kinder
morgan
canada
the
source
added
trudeau
must
be
careful
because
british
columbia
voters
and
environmentalists
gave
him
strong
support
that
helped
bring
him
to
power
in
a
crackdown
could
cost
him
support
in
both
camps
ahead
of
a
federal
election
set
for
october
although
ottawa
says
it
is
exploring
all
regulatory
legal
and
financial
alternatives
the
source
conceded
there
aren
t
an
awful
lot
of
options
for
the
prime
federal
finance
minister
bill
morneau
discussed
the
matter
with
alberta
premier
rachel
notley
in
toronto
on
wednesday
and
told
reporters
that
ottawa
had
yet
to
make
a
final
decision
we
are
working
using
all
the
tools
at
our
disposal
to
make
sure
we
move
forward
in
short
order
to
absolutely
ensure
this
project
goes
forward
he
said
without
giving
details
we
have
to
ensure
the
rule
of
law
in
this
country
some
pipeline
supporters
have
urged
trudeau
to
declare
a
national
emergency
to
push
through
the
pipeline
but
the
source
said
that
idea
is
also
off
the
table
for
now
are
calls
from
opposition
members
to
reduce
the
payments
ottawa
sends
to
british
columbia
to
help
fund
social
programs
are
they
actually
suggesting
we
cut
health
and
social
transfers
to
british
columbians
said
the
source
ottawa
and
alberta
have
talked
about
investing
in
the
project
though
it
was
unclear
how
that
would
lessen
british
columbia
s
opposition
some
commentators
suggest
provincial
and
federal
governments
underwrite
the
project
by
providing
insurance
essentially
leaving
them
on
the
hook
if
the
company
decides
to
walk
away
if
pipeline
supporters
view
trudeau
as
too
soft
they
could
accuse
him
of
not
doing
enough
to
prevent
a
constitutional
crisis
and
of
abandoning
the
energy
industry
in
alberta
where
the
liberals
also
picked
up
extra
seats
in
i
don
t
think
it
s
a
win
for
him
in
british
columbia
or
alberta
under
any
circumstances
said
pollster
nik
nanos
of
nanos
research
the
problem
is
that
is
this
open
warfare
on
canadian
dollars
