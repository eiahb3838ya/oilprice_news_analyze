update 1-germany's merkel sceptical about hardware refits for diesel cars
berlin
reuters
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
on
wednesday
played
down
the
possibility
of
forcing
carmakers
to
make
expensive
modifications
to
diesel
car
exhaust
systems
as
her
new
government
tries
to
avoid
driving
bans
in
cities
with
air
quality
problems
the
german
car
industry
which
accounts
for
some
jobs
in
europe
s
biggest
economy
is
struggling
with
a
global
backlash
against
diesel
cars
after
volkswagen
admitted
in
that
it
had
cheated
exhaust
tests
tackling
the
problem
of
diesel
cars
with
high
nitrogen
oxide
nox
emissions
known
to
cause
respiratory
disease
is
one
of
the
most
pressing
policies
facing
merkel
s
new
coalition
between
her
conservatives
and
the
social
democrats
spd
after
a
cabinet
retreat
outside
berlin
merkel
made
clear
she
had
reservations
about
carmakers
being
made
to
introduce
hardware
modifications
such
as
changing
filters
in
exhaust
systems
the
benefits
and
costs
must
be
proportionate
hardware
refits
are
relatively
said
merkel
she
reiterated
she
would
do
everything
possible
to
avoid
bans
and
that
she
believed
in
years
only
about
cities
would
have
excess
levels
of
nox
compared
with
about
cities
originally
the
issue
came
to
a
head
in
february
when
a
court
allowed
local
authorities
to
bar
heavily
polluting
diesel
vehicles
experts
say
bans
could
cut
the
resale
value
of
up
to
million
diesel
vehicles
in
europe
s
biggest
car
market
merkel
s
government
has
been
criticized
for
having
cosy
ties
with
the
auto
industry
due
to
its
importance
for
jobs
and
exports
france
and
britain
have
said
they
will
ban
new
petrol
and
diesel
cars
by
sales
of
new
cars
in
germany
plunged
by
a
quarter
in
march
according
to
the
kba
automotive
watchdog
so
far
germany
has
committed
to
software
upgrades
for
some
million
diesel
cars
by
the
end
of
the
year
to
reduce
emissions
by
up
to
percent
with
demand
for
electric
cars
growing
only
slowly
transport
minister
andreas
scheuer
has
released
the
first
million
euros
of
million
euros
million
in
subsidies
to
fund
the
purchase
of
electric
vehicles
for
public
infrastructure
agencies
however
critics
say
all
this
is
too
little
juergen
resch
head
of
the
duh
environmental
group
criticized
merkel
and
her
cabinet
for
being
remotely
controlled
by
the
auto
industry
merkel
and
vice
chancellor
and
finance
minister
olaf
scholz
a
social
democrat
stressed
the
auto
industry
was
of
crucial
importance
to
germany
we
want
it
to
be
modern
and
future
oriented
said
merkel
we
also
have
clear
exceptions
of
the
car
industry
that
has
clearly
made
serious
mistakes
the
customer
or
taxpayer
can
not
be
made
accountable
for
that
it
must
be
mainly
dealt
with
by
the
auto
industry
she
said
she
added
there
were
no
plans
for
a
summit
with
carmakers
and
that
the
new
government
was
not
keen
on
pursuing
blue
badges
to
indicate
how
clean
a
car
is
seen
by
critics
as
a
form
of
driving
restriction
our
focus
will
rather
be
on
individual
measures
that
spare
citizens
she
said
the
fallout
of
the
diesel
scandal
which
has
also
hit
daimler
and
bmw
is
still
evident
with
vw
poised
for
a
management
shakeup
which
will
include
the
departure
of
chief
executive
