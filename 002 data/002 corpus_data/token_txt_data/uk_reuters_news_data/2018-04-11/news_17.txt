indigenous
communities
that
depend
on
colombia
s
amazon
rainforest
for
their
survival
will
have
more
say
over
their
ancestral
lands
as
colombia
adds
million
hectares
to
its
protected
areas
in
an
effort
to
stem
forest
loss
the
new
measures
announced
by
colombian
president
juan
manuel
santos
on
tuesday
aim
to
create
a
buffer
zone
for
the
country
s
southern
amazon
region
farmers
are
pushing
deeper
into
forests
cutting
down
more
trees
to
clear
land
for
and
agriculture
santos
said
the
protected
areas
will
be
marked
off
in
the
next
two
weeks
meaning
that
once
and
for
all
we
will
know
where
we
can
farm
produce
and
from
what
boundary
we
will
protect
all
the
forests
and
the
entire
amazon
this
brings
the
total
area
of
protected
forests
in
colombia
to
nearly
million
hectares

crucial
in
the
fight
against

elvestuen
added
when
forests
are
degraded
or
destroyed
the
carbon
stored
in
the
trees
is
released
into
the
atmosphere
with
deforestation
accounting
for
to
percent
of
carbon
emissions
worldwide
under
a
decree
signed
by

colombia
s
amazon
tribes
will
be
able
to
decide
through
their
own
community
councils
how
to
spend
government
development
funds
in
three
provinces
indigenous
people
have
traditionally
shown
themselves
to
be
the
best
keepers
of
rainforests

the
thomson

in
an
interview
norway
said
it
would
extend
an
agreement
with
colombia
by
five
years
to
under
which
colombia
gets
payouts
for
meeting
verified
targets
to
reduce
emissions
by
slowing
deforestation
colombia
will
receive
up
to
million
a
year
through
under
the
deal
which
could
run
until
the

said
the
payments
are
usually
distributed

as
well
as
