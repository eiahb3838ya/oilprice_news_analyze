global
oil
supply
remains
a
concern
amid
opec
and
output
reductions
with
production
falling
from
mature
oilfields
while
demand
growth
remains
strong
the
international
energy
agency
s
executive
director
fatih
birol
said
on
wednesday
this
was
despite
forecasts
of
rising
oil
output
from
producers
led
by
the
united
states
which
is
expected
to
be
able
to
meet
of
global
oil
demand
growth
over
the
next
five
years
he
said
the
growth
in
the
united
states
alone
is
not
enough
to
make
me
feel
comfortable
that
there
will
be
enough
production
in
the
future
because
of
two
reasons
birol
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
international
energy
forum
first
global
oil
consumption
is
still
growing
strongly
gaining
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
this
year
driven
by
petrochemical
industrial
and
aviation
demand
he
said
second
some
older
maturing
fields
are
in
decline
every
year
we
re
losing
the
equivalent
of
north
sea
production
which
is
million
barrels
per
day
he
said
investments
in
oil
and
gas
exploration
remain
low
birol
also
said
even
though
global
oil
prices
have
returned
to
levels
our
expectation
for
investment
is
only
percent
of
what
we
ve
seen
in
before
prices
collapsed
birol
said
while
efforts
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
russia
to
cut
output
has
helped
drain
excess
global
supplies
the
industry
remains
wary
that
growing
shale
oil
production
could
cap
price
gains
another
big
worry
was
the
halving
of
venezuelan
oil
production
since
former
president
hugo
chavez
took
office
in
birol
said
we
are
very
worried
about
venezuela
as
of
today
venezuela
s
crude
production
is
half
of
that
when
mr
chavez
took
office
at
the
end
of
he
said
the
drop
is
one
of
the
largest
in
the
history
of
oil
birol
said
adding
that
the
country
s
production
is
expected
to
decline
even
further
although
it
was
hard
to
tell
how
deep
the
cuts
would
go
at
the
ief
india
s
energy
minister
dharmendra
pradhan
called
for
reasonable
oil
prices
after
brent
rose
above
to
hit
its
highest
since
late
on
tuesday
india
is
the
world
s
third
largest
oil
importer
birol
said
it
s
important
for
the
global
economy
that
we
don
t
see
a
price
spike
last
year
we
have
seen
a
very
strong
spectacular
growth
in
the
gas
markets
but
this
is
mainly
a
result
of
gas
prices
being
on
the
low
oil
and
gas
producers
should
be
wary
of
price
spikes
because
it
will
lead
buyers
to
find
alternatives
such
as
coal
and
renewables
