in
a

suarez
faces
a
difficult
task
as
colombia
struggles
to

bolster
the

after

duque
said
at
current
rates
of
production
colombia
has
less
than
six
years
worth
of
oil
reserves
the
energy
ministry
says
and
urgent
investment
in
exploration
is
needed
to
replace
reserves
duque
s
solution
to
dwindling
oil
reserves
is
to
encourage
investment
in
exploration
which
he
says
could
provide
years
more
oil
production
and
give
tax
relief
to
the
sector
he
has
also
pledged
additional
investment
at
ecopetrol
s
refineries
to
allow
exports
of
more
derivatives
still
with
the
economy
growing
at
an
expected
pace
of
just
percent
this
year
and
a
budget
deficit
that
needs
to
be
reduced
funding
such
expenditure
may
be
tough
the
colombian
petroleum
association
acp
says
the
industry
needs
to
spend
up
to
billion
a
year
just
to
keep
output
between
and
barrels
per
day
oil
companies
are
already
grappling
with
security
concerns
as
well
as
local
referendums
on
whether
to
allow
mining
in
certain
areas
and
environmental
court
rulings
that
have
stymied
major
mining
projects
in
latin
america
s
economy
a
recent
paper
by
the
acp
which
represents
private
crude
producers
warned
that
planned
referendums
put
of
oil
production
at
risk
private
oil
companies
plan
to
invest
up
to
billion
this
year
acp
