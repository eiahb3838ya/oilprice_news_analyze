and
crude

a

crude

last

the
data
showed
weekly
shifts
in
the
crude

are
being
increasingly
influenced
by

and
this
was
certainly
the
case
with
this

data
jim
ritterbusch
president
of
ritterbusch
and
associates
said
in
a
note
while
we
had
expected
a
pop
in
imports
and
a
drop
in
exports
changes
in
both
categories
far
exceeded
our
expectations
especially
on
the
import
crude
futures
extended

immediately
following
the

release
before

higher
as
the

weighed
some
of
the
more
supportive
points
in
the
report
such
as
a
draw
in
gasoline
stocks
gasoline
inventories
fell
by
million

while

which
include
diesel
and
heating
oil
fell
by

the
eia
data
showed
oil

of
the
petroleum
exporting

and
russia
increased
production
and
as
some
supply

eased
opec

curbs
has
declined
to
around
percent
in

from

in
may

matter
told

on
wednesday
investors
have
also
begun
to
worry
about
the
impact
on
energy
demand
of
the
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
its
trading
partners
including
china
trade
tension
between
the
united
states
and
china
could
drag
on
the
global
economy
bmi
research
said
the
economic
outlook
is
broadly
positive
but
a
number
of
headwinds
are
emerging
not
least
a
stronger
dollar
rising
inflationary
pressures
and
tightening
liquidity
bmi
said
slowing
trade
growth
will
weigh
on
physical
demand

president
esther
george
said
on
tuesday
uncertainty
over
trade
policy
could
slow
the
economy
even
if
recently
imposed
tariffs
are
too
small
to
have
a
big
impact
trade
policy
was
a
significant
downside
risk
to
the
outlook
for
economic
growth
