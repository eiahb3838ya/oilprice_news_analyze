russian
steel
producers
played
down
the
impact
of
the
european
union
s
curbs
on
steel
imports
on
wednesday
which
according
to
analysts
may
even
allow
some
of
them
to
increase
supplies
to
the
bloc
compared
with
a
year
ago
on
thursday
the
eu
will
set
the
quotas
for
steel
product
categories
at
the
average
of
imports
over
the
past
three
years
with
a
percent
tariff
set
for
volumes
exceeding
those
amounts
the
quotas
which
are
allocated
on
a
basis
are
designed
to
prevent
a
surge
of
steel
imports
into
the
bloc
following
the
imposition
of
tariffs
on
incoming
steel
and
aluminium
we
regret
that
states
continue
to
maintain
a
policy
of
protectionism
and
are
thereby
damaging
the
longstanding
world
trading
system
and
contributing
to
further
uncertainty
in
the
markets
said
severstal
the
largest
supplier
of
russian
steel
products
to
the
eu
the
eu
s
decision
will
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
severstal
s
financial
results
due
to
the
flexibility
of
its
distribution
channels
it
said
adding
that
it
planned
to
continue
its
supplies
to
european
customers
within
the
announced
quotas
russia
is
one
of
the
main
exporters
of
steel
to
the
eu
along
with
china
india
south
korea
turkey
and
ukraine
for
russian
steel
products
the
eu
is
the
largest
export
market
due
to
the
relatively
short
transportation
distance
severstal
s
rival
nlmk
also
hopes
to
continue
business
as
usual
despite
the
eu
s
curbs
it
said
other
players
in
the
russian
steel
market
evraz
for
which
europe
is
not
the
main
market
and
mmk
which
supplies
steel
products
to
the
bloc
declined
to
comment
severstal
nlmk
and
mmk
may
even
increase
their
sales
to
the
eu
compared
with
as
the
new
quotas
are
estimated
to
be
materially
higher
then
their
sales
to
the
bloc
