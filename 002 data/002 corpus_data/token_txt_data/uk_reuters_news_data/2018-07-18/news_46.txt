the

is
the
latest
floating

regasification

fsru
a
type
of
carrier
that
has
proliferated
since
as
many
countries
switch
to
a
cleaner
and
increasingly
cheaper
fuel
than
oil
and
coal
but
the
young
fsru
industry
has
been
beset
by
more
project
delays
than
successes
in
the
past
months
as
fluctuating
energy
prices
shipping
rates
government
policies
and
not
least
strong
demand
for
gas
in
china
reshape
the
sector
with
the
number
of

in

regasification

to

are

to
continue
if
at

slower
pace
but
strong
chinese
demand
for
lng
has
dampened
the
allure
of
projects
in
other
countries
by
lapping
up
excess
supply
and
new
entrants
are
trying
to
develop
smaller
ventures
in
the
last
year

so
fsrus
have
suffered
a
bit
of
a
setback
from
the
stellar
growth
they
were

enjoying

principal
analyst
said
some
of
that
is
down
to
conditions
unique
to
particular
proposed
projects
but
a
lot
of
it
is
more
to
do
with
demand
being
stronger
than
expected
in
existing
conventional
since
a
golden
period
between
and
when
almost
half
of
the
world
s
fsrus
came
onstream
projects
in
ghana
pakistan
and
ivory
coast
have
been
scrapped
and
in
countries
such
as
chile
croatia
and
south
africa
delayed

fsrus
are
relatively
new
the
first
was
put
in
operation
in
by
excelerate
which
figured
out
how
to
fit
an
entire
lng
terminal
onto
a
single
ship
the
unlisted
company
together
with
golar
and
hoegh
now
dominates
the
industry
on
the
face
of
it
they
have
a
big
advantage
over
onshore
import
terminals
cheaper
by
half
at
around
million
twice
as
quick
to
deliver
and
flexible
to
boot
because
the
vessel
can
journey
to
other
destinations
once
it
is
not
needed
this
was
shown
by
egypt
s
first
fsru
project
completed
by
privately
owned
bw
group
within
just
five
months
at
ain
sokhna
on
the
suez
canal
but
the
project
was
an
ideal
plug
and
play
venture
suffering
severe
power
cuts
as
its
own
gas
output
fell
egypt
had
the
infrastructure
to
accept
regasified
lng
conversely
ghana
demonstrates
the
difficulties
of
what
are
still
complex
projects
despite
their
lower
costs
and
lead
times
the
country
has
yet
to
enter
the
lng
club
despite
coming
so
close
that
two
fsrus
were
earmarked
for
two
projects
here
issues
related
to
the
construction
of
onshore
infrastructure
and
solid
contracts
with
power
plants
the
end
consumers
of
the
lng
delayed
and
scuppered
successive
ventures
the
golar
and
hoegh
fsrus
were
reassigned
to
other
locations
developing
countries
by
their
nature
have
limited
capacity
when
it
comes
to
policy
and
regulatory
structures
said
lance
crist
head
of
natural
resources
for
international
finance
corp
a
world
bank
arm
that
has
lent
to
several
fsru
projects
many
of
these
are
much
smaller
markets
you
re
not
talking
about
large
liquid
markets
with
established
infrastructure
where
you
can
just
plug
and
play
he
said
while
the
ghana
saga
unravelled
over
the
past
three
years
global
lng
market
trends
changed
the
dynamics
of
fsru
projects
rates
for
transporting
lng
rose
boosting
the
revenues
of
lng
shipping
companies
that
were
thinking
of
branching
into
fsrus
and
china
s
demand
for
gas
skyrocketed
soaking
up
an
anticipated
oversupply
in
the
market
china
s
environmental
drive
to
convert
heating
plants
from
coal
to
gas
drove
percent
of
global
lng
demand
growth
last
year
and
increased
chinese
gas
imports
by
percent
making
it
the
lng
buyer
after
japan
the
international
energy
agency
said
in
june
this
created
less
urgency
to
open
new
markets
by
parking
fsrus
in
countries
that
had
hitherto
not
bought
lng
existing
terminals
usually
underused
took
more
supplies
the
result
has
been
a
slowdown
in
the
delivery
of
planned
projects
prior
to
last
winter
when
it
looked
like
there
d
be
excess
lng
creating
new
demand
centres
via
fsrus
looked
a
more
attractive
strategy
than
it
does
now
buckland
said
which
is
not
to
say
they
won
t
come
back
to
that
in
the
meanwhile
lng
carrier
rates
which
slumped
to
per
day
in
more
than
tripled
to
a
day
this
meant
those
companies
that
operate
lng
carriers
but
wanted
to
join
the
fsru
bonanza
had
missed
the
boat
at
least
for
now
for
example
lng
carrier
company
flex
lng
backed
out
of
the
fsru
business
in
may
saying
shipping
rates
and
project
delays
had
made
the
move
unattractive
compared
to
improved
carrier
rates
its
chief
source
of
revenue
some
large
projects
are
still
due
to
come
onstream
if
at
a
slower
pace
ivory
coast
is
scheduled
to
become
an
nation
by
with
a
total
project
using
a
golar
fsru
the
rush
of
new
projects
between
and
together
with
predictions
of
lng
oversupply
also
attracted
trading
houses
wanting
to
secure
markets
for
the
rising
volumes
they
bought
and
sold
trafigura
vitol
and
gunvor
have
competing
plans
for
fsrus
in
pakistan
after
the
country
became
an
lng
importer
in
but
have
failed
to
get
projects
in
bangladesh
off
the
ground
now
the
urgency
has
receded
with
china
s
growing
appetite
for
lng
but
there
has
been
a
proliferation
of
much
smaller
projects
ventures
fsrus
for
single
users
such
as
fertiliser
plants
and
petrol
stations
for
ships
using
lng
as
bunker
fuel
in
northern
europe
the
old
fsru
only
business
model
is
becoming
crowded
with
pressure
on
returns
golar
told
investors
in
june
saying
it
was
turning
to
projects
to
drive
some
of
its
growth
the
world
bank
s
ifc
has
also
recognised
the
new
trends
and
is
hunting
for
more
projects
we
are
still
in
the
very
early
stages
of
a
pretty
dramatic
transformation
crist
said
you
require
critical
mass
or
scale
once
you
have
an
anchor
project
then
you
can
start
doing
the
milk
run
smaller
cargos
that
will
proliferate
pretty
soon
over
the
next
five
