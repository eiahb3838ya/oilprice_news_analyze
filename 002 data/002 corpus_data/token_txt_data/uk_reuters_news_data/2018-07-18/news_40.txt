trader
vitol
and
coal
miner
peabody
energy
are
partnering
with
arq
to
turn
coal
waste
into
a
oil
product
that
could
be
an
alternative
fuel
for
shippers
as
new
pollution
rules
loom
the
companies
said
in
a
statement
global
oil
and
shipping
companies
are
looking
at
any
and
all
options
to
avoid
becoming
a
casualty
of
the
major
market
dislocations
that
the
new
standards
will
create
when
they
come
into
effect
in
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
will
ban
ships
using
fuel
with
a
sulphur
content
higher
than
percent
compared
to
percent
now
unless
a
vessel
has
equipment
to
clean
up
its
sulphur
emissions
but
few
have
added
such
equipment
as
a
result
most
will
face
a
skyrocketing
fuel
bill
as
they
switch
to
more
expensive
but
cleaner
marine
gasoil
arq
ceo
julian
mcintyre
told
reuters
in
an
interview
that
its
fuel
would
meet
the
new
standards
and
could
be
used
by
the
shipping
industry
to
cut
costs
it
would
also
reduce
the
volume
of
pollutants
coming
from
the
coal
industry
its
technology
isolates
hydrocarbon
particles
from
feedstock
coal
waste
to
produce
a
fine
powder
that
can
be
blended
into
fuel
oil
and
marine
gasoil
as
well
as
crude
the
coal
industry
throws
away
anything
below
millimeters
and
that
fine
particle
coal
becomes
waste
mcintyre
said
we
take
that
feedstock
and
turn
it
into
products
that
are
worth
much
more
than
the
those
hydrocarbons
are
essentially
free
mcintyre
said
the
coal
industry
throws
out
billion
tonnes
of
them
a
year
the
equivalent
of
million
barrels
of
oil
per
day
he
said
including
transport
mcintyre
said
the
firm
is
aiming
to
produce
and
deliver
its
fuel
to
port
for
less
than
a
barrel
of
oil
equivalent
which
could
be
blended
into
fuel
oil
to
account
for
up
to
percent
of
a
barrel
arq
is
in
the
process
of
building
its
first
plant
in
kentucky
united
states
which
is
expected
to
start
up
by
early
our
basic
plant
design
is
to
produce
million
tonnes
per
annum
mcintyre
said
our
plan
is
to
build
plants
over
the
next
years
with
production
equivalent
of
about
million
bpd
of
he
added
that
a
single
plant
costs
about
million
to
build
and
takes
about
months
to
complete
other
uses
for
arq
s
fuel
would
be
to
blend
it
into
crude
oil
that
would
give
refiners
a
greater
yield
of
middle
distillates
which
are
products
or
to
press
it
back
together
into
pieces
to
be
sold
to
utilities
the
partnership
will
allow
arq
to
set
up
plants
alongside
peabody
mines
to
capture
its
waste
while
vitol
will
provide
logistics
including
blending
the
new
fuel
before
it
reaches
customers
arq
said
it
has
a
valuation
of
over
million
from
industry
and
financial
investors
in
its
latest
million
funding
round
vitol
and
peabody
agreed
to
each
invest
million
it
is
an
interesting
technology
with
good
potential
we
ll
offer
a
range
of
solutions
to
help
our
customers
comply
with
imo
there
are
many
factors
which
will
dictate
which
method
of
compliance
is
adopted
mike
muller
of
vitol
said
in
his
first
statement
since
joining
the
firm
from
shell
vitol
the
world
s
largest
independent
oil
trader
has
made
a
few
forays
into
green
and
alternative
fuel
investments
including
in
uk
battery
projects
a
new
synthetic
fuel
from
recycled
plastic
and
a
new
fund
to
develop
renewable
energies
like
wind
power
