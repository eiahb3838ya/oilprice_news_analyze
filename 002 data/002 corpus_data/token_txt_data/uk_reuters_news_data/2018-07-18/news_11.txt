washington
reuters
reaching
a
denuclearisation
deal
with
north
korea
may
take
some
time
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
on
wednesday
reiterating
that
sanctions
would
continue
to
be
enforced
in
the
meantime
even
as
russia
s
envoy
to
pyongyang
proposed
discussions
on
easing
them
speaking
at
a
cabinet
meeting
chaired
by
president
donald
trump
pompeo
who
held
inconclusive
talks
in
north
korea
earlier
this
month
said
progress
had
been
made
on
some
issues
there
s
a
lot
of
work
to
do
it
may
take
some
time
to
get
where
we
need
to
go
but
all
of
this
will
be
taking
place
against
the
backdrop
of
continued
enforcement
of
existing
sanctions
he
said
pompeo
said
north
korea
had
reaffirmed
its
commitment
to
give
up
its
nuclear
weapons
and
that
progress
had
been
made
on
arranging
the
return
of
remains
of
soldiers
killed
in
the
korean
war
i
think
in
the
next
couple
weeks
we
ll
have
the
first
remains
returned
that
s
the
commitment
pompeo
said
adding
that
the
issue
was
very
important
for
the
families
involved
pompeo
said
that
while
more
work
was
needed
it
was
a
very
hopeful
place
that
we
find
ourselves
with
making
a
strategic
change
for
north
korea
giving
them
the
opportunity
for
a
brighter
future
for
their
pompeo
travelled
to
north
korea
this
month
hoping
to
agree
a
roadmap
for
denuclearisation
but
any
progress
has
appeared
limited
and
pyongyang
issued
an
angry
statement
as
soon
as
he
left
accusing
his
delegation
of
making
demands
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
made
a
broad
commitment
to
denuclearize
at
an
unprecedented
summit
with
trump
in
june
but
offered
no
details
as
to
how
and
when
this
might
take
place
leaving
considerable
doubts
about
pyongyang
s
intentions
the
administration
has
given
no
indication
as
to
when
dialogue
on
denuclearisation
might
resume
and
has
appeared
to
back
away
from
trying
to
set
a
timeline
for
the
process
on
tuesday
trump
said
there
was
no
time
limit
and
reiterated
in
a
tweet
on
wednesday
that
there
was
no
rush
noting
that
sanctions
remained
in
place
and
there
would
be
big
benefits
for
north
korea
at
the
end
of
the
process
trump
also
said
he
elicited
a
promise
from
russian
president
vladimir
putin
in
their
helsinki
meeting
this
week
to
help
negotiate
with
north
korea
but
did
not
say
how
while
the
united
states
has
stressed
the
need
to
maintain
sanctions
on
north
korea
russia
s
envoy
to
pyongyang
was
quoted
by
the
ria
news
agency
as
saying
it
would
be
logical
to
raise
the
question
of
easing
sanctions
with
the
security
council
given
positive
changes
trump
announced
after
the
june
summit
that
kim
had
agreed
to
return
the
remains
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
americans
killed
in
the
korean
war
but
no
remains
have
been
handed
over
since
then
raising
further
questions
about
north
korean
intentions
a
senior
defence
official
said
on
tuesday
washington
hoped
north
korea
would
return
about
sets
of
remains
within
two
weeks
but
details
were
still
uncertain
in
spite
of
two
days
of
talks
between
and
north
korean
officials
on
sunday
and
monday
