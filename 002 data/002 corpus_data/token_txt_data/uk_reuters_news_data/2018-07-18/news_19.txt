britain
s
tullow
oil
has
to
cover
nearly
million
of
costs
linked
to
a
cancelled
rig
contract
in
ghana
after
losing
a
dispute
with
partner
kosmos
energy
the
companies
said
on
wednesday
the
costs
relate
to
a
rig
contract
with
seadrill
that
tullow
cancelled
in
december
after
ghana
set
a
drilling
moratorium
on
its
ten
offshore
oil
and
gas
field
which
is
located
in
waters
then
claimed
by
both
ghana
and
ivory
coast
tullow
is
lead
operator
of
the
project
in
which
kosmos
energy
anadarko
petroleum
corporation
ghana
national
petroleum
corporation
and
petrosa
also
hold
stakes
a
london
judge
ordered
tullow
this
month
to
pay
seadrill
around
million
saying
tullow
was
wrong
to
end
a
contract
between
the
companies
on
the
grounds
of
force
majeure
over
a
maritime
border
dispute
in
west
africa
the
company
had
originally
said
its
partners
would
pay
in
keeping
with
their
stakes
in
the
project
but
kosmos
challenged
this
a
panel
of
arbitrators
at
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
ruled
in
favour
of
kosmos
which
means
tullow
will
not
be
able
to
claim
back
kosmos
million
share
of
the
seadrill
cost
and
will
have
to
reimburse
kosmos
around
million
in
legal
and
rig
demobilisation
costs
a
tullow
spokesman
said
anadarko
has
answered
tullow
s
cash
call
over
the
seadrill
ruling
anadarko
had
no
immediate
comment
a
tullow
spokesman
on
wednesday
said
the
company
had
decided
not
to
appeal
the
original
court
ruling
with
tullow
s
percent
stake
in
ten
and
its
duty
to
pay
costs
for
ghana
national
petroleum
corporation
s
gnpc
stake
the
british
company
had
expected
to
pay
around
million
net
the
challenge
for
tullow
is
to
demonstrate
that
the
events
of
are
behind
it
and
in
it
is
pushing
ahead
with
a
strategy
that
involves
doing
more
with
less
and
unlocking
the
upside
potential
in
east
africa
rbc
said

tullow
is
working
towards
final
investment
decisions
for
its
kenya
and
uganda
projects
