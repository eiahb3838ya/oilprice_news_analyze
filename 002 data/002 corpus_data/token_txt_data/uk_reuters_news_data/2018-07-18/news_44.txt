no
one
likes
to
predict
recession
but
the
global
economy
is
likely
to
experience
a
significant
slowdown
before
the
end

the
slowdown
may
be
necessary

economic
outlook

international
monetary
fund
forecasts
the
global
economy
will
expand
at
percent
in
both

slightly
faster
than
the
percent
achieved
in

beneath
the
sanguine

the

provides
a
long
list
of
downside
risk
factors
including
mounting
trade
tensions
rising
interest

political
uncertainty
and

financial

growth
generally
remains
strong
in
advanced
economies
but
it
has
slowed
in
many
of
them
including
countries
in
the
euro
area
japan
and
the
united
kingdom
the
imf
admits
even
growth
is
projected
to
decelerate
over
the
next
few
years
however
as
the
long
cyclical
recovery
runs
its
course
and
the
effects
of
temporary
fiscal
stimulus
wane
the
broad
global
expansion
that
began
roughly
two
years
ago
has
plateaued
and
become
less

in

to

costs
in
the
united
states
where
growth
remains
strong
the
expansion
now
shows
unmistakeable
signs
of
being
at
a
late
stage
the
economy
has
been
expanding
for
over
nine
years
according
to
the
business
cycle
dating
committee
of
the
national
bureau
of
economic
research
the
current
expansion
is
already
the
on
record
and
will
overtake
the
long
boom
of
the
if
the
economy
is
still
growing
in
july
unemployment
is
close
to
its
lowest
level
for
years
and
at
or
below
the
levels
seen
at
the
height
of
previous
booms
industrial
production
is
growing
at
some
of
the
fastest
rates
for
years
the
institute
for
supply
management
s
composite
index
shows
one
of
the

increases
in

activity
in

the
university

michigan
s
consumer
sentiment
index
shows
household
confidence
close
to
highs
but
consumer
prices
are
rising
at
the
fastest
rate
since
early
cancelling
out
hourly
wage
growth
despite
a
strong
economy
and
the
yield
curve
for
government
securities
shows
signs
of
inverting
which
has
often
been
a
harbinger
of
previous
economic
slowdowns
all
these
indicators
show
strong
cyclical
behaviour
in
every
case
they
point
to
an
expansion
the
top
of
the
cycle
the
global
economy
is
rapidly
running
out
of
spare
capacity
and
nowhere
is
that
more
obvious
than
in
the
oil
market
the
oil
market
s
unused
production
capacity
has
fallen
to
lows
as
a
result
of
strong
consumption
growth
and
a
series
of
output
disruptions
in
venezuela
libya
and
elsewhere
iran
sanctions
threaten
to
reduce
spare
capacity
even
further
from
the
start
of
november
pushing
it
down
to
the
lowest
level
since
the
oil
shocks
of
and
global
oil
consumption
has
surged
by
an
average
of
million
barrels
per
day
in
each
of
the
last
three
years
and
is
forecast
to
rise
by
a
similar
amount
in
and
the
result
is
that
the
global
oil
industry
is
being
stretched
to
the
limit
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
oil
market
report
iea
july
oil
prices
have
already
climbed
by
more
than
percent
over
the
last
year
putting
upward
pressure
on
global
inflation
though
they
have
subsequently
eased
back
slightly
in
recent
days
in
the
past
the
final
stages
of
an
economic
expansion
have
usually
coincided
with
a
sharp
escalation
in
oil
prices
with
prices
dropping
back
during
the
subsequent
economic
contraction
the
causality
between
economic
growth
and
oil
prices
runs
in
both
directions
with
economic
growth
as
a
key
driver
of
oil
consumption
and
prices
and
oil
prices
acting
as
a
check
on
expansion
recessions
in
and
all
helped
cool
previous
rapid
increases
in
oil
prices
by
cutting
consumption
growth
with
the
oil
market
running
out
of
capacity
commodity
prices
rising
and
interest
rates
turning
higher
it
seems
increasingly
likely
the
global
economy
will
experience
a
slowdown
within
the
next
months
the
coming
slowdown
need
not
be
as
wrenching
as
the
recession
which
accompanied
the
financial
crisis
in
in
fact
it
probably
won
t
be
the
last
downturn
was
exceptional
in
terms
of
its
length
and
severity
most
of
the
business
cycle
contractions
since
have
been
much
shorter
and
shallower
like
several
previous
slowdowns
the
next
one
might
be
marked
by
a
pause
in
growth
rather
than
an
actual
decline
in
economic
activity
and
it
need
not
be
global
in
scale
some
slowdowns
were
confined
to
a
subset
to
economies
such
as
the
east
asian
financial
crisis
of
while
others
continue
expanding
but
the
global
economy
and
the
oil
market
appear
to
be
on
an
unsustainable
trajectory
and
the
only
way
to
resolve
the
growing
contradictions
is
likely
to
be
a
slowdown
in
the
next
months
