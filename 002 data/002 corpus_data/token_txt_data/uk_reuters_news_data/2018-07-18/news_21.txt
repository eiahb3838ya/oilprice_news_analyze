update 2-u.s. crude oil output hits 11 mln bpd for first time ever
reuters
crude
oil
production
last
week
hit
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
for
the
first
time
in
the
nation
s
history
the
energy
department
said
on
wednesday
as
the
ongoing
boom
in
shale
production
continues
to
drive
output
the
gains
represent
a
rapid
increase
in
output
as
the
data
if
confirmed
by
monthly
figures
puts
the
united
states
as
the
second
largest
producer
of
crude
oil
just
behind
russia
which
was
producing
million
bpd
in
early
july
according
to
sources
eleven
million
would
have
made
us
the
biggest
producer
in
the
world
but
actually
russian
production
in
june
was
above
million
so
this
is
kind
of
like
the
space
race
said
sandy
fielden
director
of
research
in
commodities
and
energy
at
morningstar
the
united
states
has
added
nearly
million
bpd
in
production
since
november
thanks
to
rapid
increases
in
shale
drilling
i
don
t
think
production
is
plateauing
at
it
s
fully
expected
to
grow
beyond
we
won
t
be
topping
out
there
said

north

crude
inventories
increased
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
july
compared
with
analysts
expectations
for
a
decrease
of
million
barrels
crude
futures
edged
down
on
the
data
crude
was
down
cents
to
a
barrel
while
brent
dropped
cents
to
a
barrel
the
benchmarks
have
gained
steadily
since
bottoming
out
below
a
barrel
in
early
crude
is
up
nearly
percent
this
year
weekly
production
figures
from
the
energy
information
administration
are
notorious
for
revisions
as
monthly
data
released
on
a
lag
shows
production
at
million
bpd
as
of
april
in
the
last
several
weeks
the
eia
has
rounded
off
production
to
the
nearest
hundred
thousand
barrels
so
that
figure
had
been
stuck
at
million
bpd
for
over
a
month
this
report
comes
amidst
worries
that
infrastructure
bottlenecks
which
make
it
difficult
for
producers
to
get
their
oil
to
market
could
soon
start
curtailing
output
morgan
stanley
analysts
said
recently
that
pipeline
constraints
could
cap
growth
in
west
texas
they
said
the
permian
shale
play
has
about
million
bpd
of
pipeline
capacity
about
what
is
being
produced
there
now
even
as
production
ramps
up
the
united
states
the
world
s
top
oil
consumer
still
depends
on
imports
net
crude
imports
rose
last
week
by
million
bpd
to
about
million
bpd
gasoline
stocks
fell
by
million
barrels
compared
with
analysts
expectations
for
a
drop
distillate
stockpiles
which
include
diesel
and
heating
oil
fell
by
barrels
versus
expectations
for
a
increase
