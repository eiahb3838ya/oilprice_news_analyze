a
federal

on
wednesday
temporarily
blocked
a
decision
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
that
would
have
lifted
strict
limits
on
the
number
of
remanufactured
heavy
duty
vehicles
known
as
glider
trucks
that
could
be
sold
the
vehicles
have
a
used
engine
in
a
new
frame
and
rules
introduced
under
former
president
barack
obama
a
democrat
said
nearly
all
new
trucks
on
the
road
must
use
more
efficient
less
polluting
engines
the
glider
trucks
emit
up
to
times
more
diesel
particulate
matter
and
up
to
times
more
nitrogen
oxides
than
new
trucks
on
the
market
the
epa
has
said
epa
issued
a
memo
on
july
that
said
the
agency
would
not
enforce
a
limit
of
up
to
gliders
per
manufacturer
the
epa
in
november
formally
proposed
undoing
the
glider
rule
but
has
not
finalized
it
the
epa
which
said
wednesday
it
was
reviewing
the
decision
had
said
in
its
memo
that
enforcing
the
rules
would
result
in
the
loss
of
jobs
and
threaten
the
viability
of
companies
making
the
glider
trucks
volvo
group
north
america
cummins
inc
and
navistar
international
corp
said
last
year
they
opposed
efforts
to
reverse
the
limits
on
glider
trucks
glider
kits
should
not
be
used
for
circumventing
purchase
of
currently
certified
the
move
could
inflict
uncertainty
and
damage
to
our
industry
the
companies
said
environmental
defense
fund
president
fred
krupp
said
the
decision
today
is
an
important
step
toward
protecting
the
health
of
all
americans
from
diesel
freight
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
said
the
epa
must
respond
to
the
lawsuit
from
environmental
groups
by
july
the
court
order
said
the
stay
is
to
give
the
court
sufficient
opportunity
to
consider
the
emergency
motion
and
not
a
ruling
on
the
merits
of
blocking
the
memo
the
epa
has
previously
said
that
if
gliders
were
allowed
through
they
would
make
up
percent
of
the
freight
trucks
on
the
road
but
would
account
for
one
third
of
all
nitrogen
oxides
and
particulate
matter
emissions
from
the
heavy
truck
fleet
glider
companies
told
the
epa
that
glider
trucks
are
percent
cheaper
than
new
vehicles
in
august
the
obama
administration
issued
final
rules
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
from
medium
and
heavy
duty
trucks
through
a
sector
that
accounts
for
percent
of
carbon
pollution
from
vehicles
the
commercial
vehicle
rules
are
expected
to
cut
billion
metric
tons
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
