wasn

supposed
to
be
viable

government
and
industry
working
together
have
given
etap
a
new
lease
of
life
that
is
being
closely
watched
by
countries
and
companies
eyeing
other
ageing
projects
around
the
world
when
etap
was
launched
years
ago
today
some
experts
predicted
the
uk
sector
of
the
north
sea
would
cease
most
production
by
government
efforts
to
keep
producers
in
the
basin
home
to
the
brent
crude
that
underpins
the
price
benchmark
gained
urgency
with
the
oil
price
crash
cheaper
oil
also
forced
the
industry
to
upgrade
technology
and
find
more
efficiencies

original
plans
to
stop
production

to
invest

to
take
stock
of
the
potential
going

and
make
an
intervention
that

ariel

bp
s
north
sea
chief
told
reuters
we
ve
done
that
on
etap
s
example
shows
how
efforts
to
extend
the
production
in
the
north
sea
are
succeeding
providing
lessons
for
producers
in
other
fields
near
exhaustion
such
as
those
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
southeast
asia
etap
produces
around
barrels
per
day
of
oil
now
against
as
much
as
bpd
in
but
bp
production
in
the
entirety
of
the
north
sea
is
set
to
double
in
to
bpd
from
as
fields
such
as
clair
ridge
west
of
shetland
islands
come
on
line
flores
said
there
are
a
number
of
fields
in
the
central
north
sea
area
waiting
for
final
investment
decisions
fids
and
for
some
of
those
the
potential

is
etap
flores
said
oil
giants
such
as
bp
royal
dutch
shell
and
total
as
well
as
smaller
nimbler
north
producers
such
as
enquest
and
premier
oil
are
all
finding
business
opportunities
in
the
area
the
region
has
also
seen
something
of
a
changing
of
the
guard
in
recent
years
shell
bp
omv
and
engie
have
sold
fields
and
infrastructure
to
smaller
players
many
of
which
are
backed
by
private
equity
or
specialise
in
squeezing
more
life
out
of
mature
assets
such
as
chrysaor
siccar
point
and
neptune
chrysaor
acquired
around
half
of
shell
s
north
sea
portfolio
last
year
and
is
now
one
of
the
largest
operators
in
the
basin
boosting
reserves
by
drilling
wells
around
ageing
fields
such
as
the
armada
field
six
years
ago
you
went
to
the
raising
money
and
everyone
was
talking
about
fiscal
instability
decommissioning
a
basin
in
decline
and
that
has
completely
changed
chrysaor
ceo
phil
kirk
told
reuters
now
people
talk
about
opportunity
about
a
change
in
the
ownership
of
the
oil
and
gas
companies
invested
billions
in
the
north
sea
in
the
late
to
meet
surging
demand
from
asia
but
the
subsequent
oil
price
rally
masked
huge
inefficiencies
and
waste
when
the
bottom
fell
out
in
as
shale
producers
in
the
united
states
competed
with
opec
for
market
share
output
had
already
dwindled
to
around
million
barrels
per
day
from
a
peak
of
million
in
investments
were
drying
up
and
many
operators
were
focused
on
plugging
wells
and
dismantling
fields
that
s
where
the
uk
government
stepped
in
scottish
oil
and
gas
magnate
ian
wood
was
commissioned
in
to
look
at
how
government
could
stem
the
outflow
from
an
industry
that
provides
jobs
in
the
region
the
wood
report
led
to
the
creation
of
the
independent
oil
and
gas
authority
oga
and
a
regulatory
overhaul
including
scrapping
a
percent
petroleum
revenue
tax
and
starting
in
november
allowing
the
transfer
of
the
tax
history
of
an
asset
to
the
buyer
who
can
then
offset
tax
on
decommissioning
on
the
decommissioning
side
they
operators
can
see
that
it
s
more
manageable
they
can
see
there
are
improvements
happening
they
can
see
that
the
government
has
listened
oga
director
of
operations
gunther
newcombe
told
reuters
tax
cuts
for
the
industry
in
and
alone
amounted
to
billion
pounds
the
government
says
the
oga
also
started
working
with
north
sea
operators
to
assemble
and
share
cost
benchmarks
some
thought
the
uk
north
sea
was
facing
a
terminal
decline
but
it
wasn
t
for
lack
of
resource
in
the
ground
it
was
investment
appetite
it
was
portfolio
issues
and
perceived
barriers
for
investment
said
chrysaor
s
kirk
industry
made
its
own
changes
using
simpler
field
designs
replacing
kit
from
paints
to
seabed
pumps
with
equipment
and
increasing
cooperation
among
producers
to
save
on
transportation
and
development
costs
the
north
sea
today
can
compete
with
other
offshore
basins
and
in
some
cases
even
onshore
shale
sensors
that
bp
has
installed
on
drilling
equipment
and
pumps
now
detect
minuscule
vibrations
that
give
engineers
precious
extra
hours
or
even
minutes
to
change
a
valve
or
shut
down
a
unit
preventing
serious
damage
and
minimising
downtime
for
a
field
for
example
we
are
looking
at
things
more
collaboratively
trusting
contractors
to
be
able
to
come
up
with
solutions
for
us
flores
said
at
times
there
had
been
duplication
of
work
checking
and
recalculating
calculations
now
there
s
a
drive
towards
eliminating
bp
s
operating
efficiency
in
the
north
sea
is
now
more
than
percent
up
from
percent
earlier
this
decade
he
said
for
the
uk
oil
sector
as
a
whole
including
the
north
sea
production
efficiency
measured
as
a
percentage
of
potential
maximum
output
is
now
percent
compared
to
a
low
of
percent
in
the
oga

this
week

body
uk
oil
and

says
unit
operating
costs
last
year
were
around
per
barrel
of
oil
equivalent
half
that
in
producers
have
also
become
effective
in
slowing
the
natural
decline
of
fields
according
to
the
bernstein
brokerage
and
research
group
the
rate
of
output
decline
has
come
down
to
percent
in
from
percent
in
in
the
ultimate
show
of
confidence
companies
are
new
projects
dozens
of
companies
competed
for
blocks
to
explore
and
develop
new
fields
in
may
another
licencing
round
for
blocks
will
close
in
november
we
re
finding
a
huge
appetite
for
the
uk
we
re
looking
currently
at
possibly
sanctioning
projects
this
year
said
the
oga
s
newcombe
we
ve
got
around
that
we
re
looking
at
right
now
last
year
we
sanctioned

this

we
sanctioned

shell
in
february
decided
to
go
ahead
with
the
development
of
the
penguins
its
first
new
project
in
the

in
six
years
followed
by
the

in

on
the

bp
has
approved
the
development
of
the
alligin
and
vorlich
fields
west
of
the
shetlands
two
fids
in
six
months
tells
you
that
the
north
sea
competes
for
capital
against
other
opportunities
in
other
jurisdictions
helped
enormously
by
the
government
s
commitment
said

s
uk
country
chair
total
expenditure
in
the
north
sea
in
including
exploration
development
and
decommissioning
was
half
that
of
at
around
billion
pounds
but
production
of
both
oil
and
gas
is
expected
to
grow
to
around
million
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
this
year
from
million
in
the
oga
said
i
don
t
think
the
