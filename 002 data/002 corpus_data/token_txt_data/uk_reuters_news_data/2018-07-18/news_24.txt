a
quarter

billion
stirrers
a

it
would
provide

removing
plastic
straws
is
one
of
the
simplest
ways
our
guests
can
contribute
to
plastic
reduction
when
staying
with
us
something
they
are
increasingly
concerned
about
and
are
already
doing
in
their
own
homes
arne
sorenson
president
and
ceo
of
marriott
international
said
in
a
statement
the
environment
programme
estimated
in
its
global
clean
seas
campaign
launched
last
year
that
some
million
tons
of
plastic
is
dumped
into
the
ocean
every
year
damaging
the
marine
although
plastic
straws
represent
a
relatively
small
portion
of
all
plastic
waste
they
are
difficult
to
recycle
and
often
end
up
in
landfills
where
they
decompose
at
a
much
slower
rate
than
paper
alternatives
