american
airlines
warned
airline
passengers
may
eventually
face
higher
ticket
prices
if
oil
prices
remain
high
prompting
carriers
to
remove
seats
from
the
market
oil
prices
have
risen
around
percent
compared
to
the
levels
seen
last
year
and
that
is
putting
pressure
on
airline
profits
if
it
becomes
clear
this
is
the
new
normal
you
would
see
over
time
less
capacity
and
growth
in
the
industry
and
therefore
higher
prices
but
i
don
t
think
that
s
going
to
happen
in
the
near
term
ceo
doug
parker
told
reporters
on
the
sidelines
of
the
annual
iata
meeting
of
airline
executives
in
sydney
iata
which
represents
about
airlines
comprising
percent
of
global
air
traffic
has
said
that
on
monday
it
will
revise
down
its
forecast
for
industry
profitability
this
year
due
to
higher
oil
infrastructure
and
labour
costs
the
united
states
last
month
agreed
a
deal
with
the
united
arab
emirates
and
in
january
with
qatar
to
resolve
claims
from
the
three
largest
carriers
that
gulf
airlines
had
received
unfair
government
subsidies
parker
said
he
was
pleased
with
the
result
of
the
talks
but
needed
to
see
more
from
the
gulf
carriers
before
american
airlines
could
consider
partnerships
with
them
we
haven
t
had
enough
time
to
make
sure
that
those
resolutions
have
the
effect
that
we
hope
for
so
we
shall
see
he
said
qatar
airways
had
plans
to
buy
a
stake
in
american
airlines
last
year
but
reversed
that
decision
saying
an
investment
did
not
meet
its
objectives
american
airlines
executives
had
opposed
the
share
buy
when
asked
on
sunday
whether
he
would
be
open
to
investments
from
gulf
airlines
further
down
the
line
parker
said
american
airlines
did
not
need
such
transactions
he
added
however
we
are
open
to
investments
