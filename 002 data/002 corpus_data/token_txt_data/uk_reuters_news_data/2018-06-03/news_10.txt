troops
police
and

ushered
the
last
group
of
evacuees
from
homes
on
the
eastern
tip
of
hawaii
s
big
island
early
on
saturday
hours
before
creeping
lava
from
the
kilauea
volcano
severed
all
road
access
to
the
area
officials
said
a
stream
of
lava
as
wide
across
as
three
football
fields
flowed
over
a
highway
near
a
key
junction
on
the
outskirts
of
kapoho
a
seaside
community
of
private
homes
and
vacation
rentals
rebuilt
after
a
destructive
eruption
of
kilauea
in
the
lava
flow
left
kapoho
and
the
adjacent
development
of
vacationland
encompassing
about
homes
combined
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
island
by
road
according
to
the
hawaii
county
civil
defense
agency
authorities
since
wednesday
had
been
urging
residents
of
the
area
to
pack
up
and
leave
before
lava
spewing
from
a
volcanic
fissure
at
the
eastern
foot
of
kilauea
reached
the
area
the
final
phase
of
the
evacuation
was
carried
out
on
friday
night
and
early
saturday
by
fire
and
police
department
personnel
with
help
from
the
hawaii
national
guard
and
public
works
teams
county
civil
defense
spokeswoman
janet
snyder
told
reuters
by
email
an
estimated
people
live
in
the
greater
kapoho
area
but
snyder
said
it
was
not
immediately
clear
how
many
residents
if
any
chose
to
stay
behind
another
people
have
already
been
evacuated
from
the
leilani
estates
subdivision
an
area
further
west
where
dozens
of
homes
have
been
devoured
or
cut
off
by
rivers
of
molten
rock
streaming
over
the
landscape
since
may
toxic
sulfur
dioxide
gas
emitted
from
the
volcanic
vents
in
the
ground
has
created
an
additional
hazard
so
too
have
airborne
volcanic
glass
fibers
called
pele
s
hair
wispy
strands
produced
by
lava
fountains
and
carried
aloft
by
the
wind
they
are
named
for
the
volcano
fire
goddess
of
hawaiian
myth
the
lava
itself
extruded
from
about
two
dozen
fissures
that
opened
on
the
slope
of
kilauea
s
eastern
rift
zone
earlier
this
month
has
also
knocked
out
telephone
and
power
lines
and
forced
the
shutdown
of
a
geothermal
energy
plant
the
latest
upheaval
of
kilauea
one
of
the
world
s
most
active
volcanoes
comes
on
the
heels
of
an
earlier
eruption
cycle
that
began
in
and
continued
almost
nonstop
for
years
destroying
more
than
dwellings
and
other
structures
the
current
fissure
activity
has
been
accompanied
for
weeks
by
daily
periodic
explosions
of
gas
and
volcanic
rock
from
kilauea
s
summit
crater
as
well
as
earthquakes
but
the
summit
has
quieted
down
over
the
past
few
days
as
tons
of
rubble
shaken
loose
from
the
interior
walls
of
the
crater
have
fallen
into
the
void
and
plugged
up
the
bottom
of
the
vent
scientists
are
unsure
whether
the
blockage
will
eventually
bring
an
end
to
further
eruptions
at
the
summit
or
lead
to
a
buildup
of
pressure
that
could
cause
a
much
bigger
explosion
