singapore

the
shipping
industry
will
this
year
scrap
the
largest
number
of
oil
tankers
in
over
driven
by
weak
earnings
firm
prices
for
scrap
steel
and
the
need
to
prepare
fleets
for
strict
new
environmental
regulations
the
surge
in
scrapping
underscores
how
the
sector
is
grappling
with
one
of
its
crises
hit
hard
after
rates
for
transporting

most

pakistan

the
uptick
in

rates
has
come

increased
opposition
from

the

any
