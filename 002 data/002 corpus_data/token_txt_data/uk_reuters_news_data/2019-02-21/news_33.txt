the
united
states
and
china
were
tackling
some
of
the
stickiest
issues
in
their
trade
war
kept
world
shares
near
a
high
on
thursday
though
it
could
not
prevent
a
favourite
chinese
proxy
the
aussie
dollar
hitting
the
skids
a
mixed
bag
of
economic
data
ranging
from
disappointing
durable
goods
orders
to
slightly
brighter
french
pmi
data
meant
wall
street
was
set
for
a
more
choppy
start
than
had
initially
been
expected
some
poor
company
earnings
and
ongoing
brexit
confusion
had
sapped
the
main
ftse
dax
and
cac
bourses
in
europe
following
a
somewhat
more
eventful
session
in
asia
msci
s
main
index
had
struck
a
new
a
month
high
after
sources
told
reuters
overnight
that
and
chinese
negotiators
were
drawing
up
six
memorandums
of
understanding
to
help
ease
their
trade
feud
they
include
forced
technology
transfer
and
cyber
theft
intellectual
property
rights
services
currency
agriculture
and
barriers
to
trade
the
sources
said
adding
the
two
sides
were
pushing
for
an
agreement
by
a
march
deadline
after
which
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
will
ratchet
up
the
day
s
biggest
mover
though
was
the
aussie
dollar
it
had
slumped
more
than
percent
after
one
of
the
country
s
big
banks
westpac
called
for
two
rba
rate
cuts
this
year
and
reuters
reported
that
the
chinese
port
of
dalian
had
banned
imports
of
australian
coal
coal
is
australia
s
biggest
export
earner
it
is
hard
know
how
much
of
this
is
in
the
price
considering
the
fall
we
saw
from
the
aussie
dollar
last
year
said

graf
it
is
still
up
this
year
however
which
means
there
is
totally
scope
for
further
downside
the
aussie
was
last
trading
at
down
percent
on
the
day
and
it
was
not
the
only
one
struggling
the
kiwi
dollar
got
bundled
down
percent
in
the
fallout
and
the
dollar
went
back
in
the
red
after
the
durable
goods
miss
the
euro
too
spent
its
day
dithering
between
and
french
pmis
had
been
reassuring
but
were
then
followed
by
news
that
euro

factory
output
had
unexpectedly
slammed
into
reverse

below

it
has
been
for
much
of
the
past
four
years
the
euro

economy
remained
close
to
stagnation
in
february
the
general
picture
remained
one
of
a
more
subdued
business
environment
than
seen
throughout
much
of
last
year

williamson
said
the

pointed
to

estimate
for

come
soon
after
