mr
trump
and
his
friends
believe
that
climate
change
is
something
that
has
just
been
invented

its
an
ideological
concept

listen
to
trump
has
cast
doubt
on
the
science
of
climate
change
in
he
announced
his
intent
to
withdraw
the

present
new
plans
for
more
ambitious
greenhouse

emissions
cuts
students

have
followed
her
lead
and
also
skipped

took
her
protest
to
last
month
s
world
economic
forum
in
davos
to
galvanize
leaders
meeting
there
to
action
politicians
failure
to
act
would
be
the
greatest
failure
of
human
history
and
they
will
be
remembered
as
the
greatest
villains
of
all
time
