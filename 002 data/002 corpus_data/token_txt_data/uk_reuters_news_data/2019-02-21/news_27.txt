london

a
rise
in
exports
of
british
oil
may
soften
the
potential
blow
to
the
sale
of
uk
crude
to
asia
from
a
brexit
export
data
showed
and
trade
sources
said
offsetting
likely
lower
shipments
to
south
korea
while
britain
and
the
european
union
remain
in
talks
over
brexit
tariffs
and
other
terms
governing
britain
s
trade
with
most
of
the
globe
would
be
set
under
world
trade
organization
rules
under
a
departure
from
the
eu
the
flow
of
british
crude
to
asia
is
significant
for
the
global
market
as
it
can
affect
prices
and
is
a
popular
trading
play
oil
companies
have
been
worried
a
brexit
could
limit
this
arbitrage
creating
excess
supply
in
europe
according
to
uk
government
and
oil
trading
sources
the
flow
of
british
crude
to
china
would
not
face
increased
tariffs
under
a
brexit
china
has
in
recent
months
been
purchasing
more
than
south
korea
the
other
major
asian
buyer
of
uk
oil
leaving
without
a
deal
wouldn
t
impact
the
tariffs
we
face
from
china
a
uk
government
source
said
since
britain
already
trades
with
china
under
wto
rules
this
would
go
some
way
to
leaving
the
arbitrage
in
asia
open
for
forties
the
most
popular
british
crude
grade
among
asian
buyers
with
the
way
forward
still
unclear
the
uk
s
department
for
international
trade
said
the
government
recommended
planning
for
all
brexit
outcomes
including
no
deal
our
priority
is
to
avoid
disruption
to
our
global
trading
relationships
as
we
leave
the
european
union
and
we
are
seeking
continuity
for
existing
free
trade
agreements
the
department
said
in
a
statement
a
trader
with
an
oil
company
dealing
in
forties
said
china
would
remain
a
viable
outlet
under
a
brexit
yes
i
think
it
would
he
said
but
i
suppose
looking
at
the
overall
picture
you
would
have
fewer
options
for
your
flows
to
south
korea
may
decline
he
said
since
the
uk
would
drop
out
of
a
agreement
fta
the
eu
has
with
that
country
with
the
fta
south
korea
became
a
big
buyer
of
forties
a
trade
that
has
helped
support
the
grade
s
value
such
shipments
also
affect
global
prices
as
forties
is
part
of
the
brent
benchmark
used
for
oil
deals
as
a
result
trading
plays
hinging
on
sending
uk
crude
via
tanker
to
the
east
or
appearing
to
do
so
have
become
a
popular
feature
of
the
market
oil
companies
that
trade
forties
are
concerned
its
value
could
drop
if
south
korea
imposes
a
customs
tariff
that
matches
levels
should
the
uk
leave
the
eu
with
no
deal
or
without
a
separate
trade
agreement
with
seoul
we
worried
about
the
impact
it
would
have
on
forties
if
the
obvious
arbitrage
was
not
there
any
more
a
second
north
sea
trading
source
said
this
would
lower
the
value
as
there
will
be
too
much
crude
in
the
north
sea
that
needs
to
find
a
still
china
has
increasingly
been
providing
that
home
buying
between
million
and
million
barrels
of
forties
a
month
since
october
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
data
the
economics
of
the
trade
hinge
on
a
number
of
factors
such
as
freight
rates
and
the
competitiveness
of
a
crude
such
as
forties
against
a
more
local
crude
grade
based
on
the
dubai
benchmark
clearly
the
uk
has
found
a
ready
market
for
this
type
of
crude
in
china
kpler

oil
trade
patterns
said
in
a
report
the
flow
of
forties
into
china
is
particularly
interesting
given
the
unusually
long
distance

shipment
