talks
the
trade
war
between
the
economic
giants
have
roiled
financial
markets
over
the
past
year
the
united

and
china
have
started

commitments
in

on

issues

trade
dispute
marking
the
most
significant
progress
yet
toward
ending
a
trade
war
sources
familiar
with
the
negotiations
told
reuters
we
must
be
a
little
bit
careful
that
if
the
trade
negotiation
would
be
ended
with
a
temporary
success
that
could
in

mean
the

might
restart
their
monetary
tightening

president
donald

indicated

see
little
risk
to
leaving
rates
alone
for
now
the
bar
to
restarting
rate
hikes
in
the
near
term
seems
to
be
quite
high
with
several
participants
arguing
that
rate
increases
would
be
necessary
only
if
inflation
outcomes
were
higher
than
in
the
baseline
outlook
paul
ashworth
chief
economist
at
capital
economics
said
in
a
note
the
upshot
is
we
now
expect
the
fed
to
leave
rates
unchanged
throughout
this
year
before
a
further
deterioration
in
economic
growth
forces
it
to
cut
rates

a
total

said

signalled
it
will
soon
lay
out
a
plan

stop
letting
go
of
trillion

bonds
and
other
assets

policymakers
are
still
debating
how
long
their
newly
adopted
patient
stance
on
rates
will
last

the
currency
market
the
australian
dollar
was
in
the
spotlight

expectations
the
aussie
initially
gained
more
than
half
a
percent
after
the
release
of
the
figures
though
it
reversed
course
as
the
underlying
soft
outlook
for
the
economy
reinforced
expectations
of
a
possible
rate

year
