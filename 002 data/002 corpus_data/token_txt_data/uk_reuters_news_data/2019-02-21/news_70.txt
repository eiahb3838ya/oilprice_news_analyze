we

got
the

out

see
little
risk
to
leaving

alone
for
now
the
bar
to
restarting
rate
hikes
in
the
near

seems
to
be
quite
high

rate
increases
would
be
necessary

outcomes
were
higher
than
in
the
baseline
outlook
paul
ashworth

upshot
is
we
now
expect

rates
unchanged

this
year

a
further
deterioration
in
economic
growth
forces
it
to
cut

soon
lay
out
a
plan

other
assets
