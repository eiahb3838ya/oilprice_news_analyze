luxury

is
forging
ahead
with

brexit
deal
or
no
deal
i
still
have
to
believe
that
we
ll
get
to
a
proper
and
right
decision
because
a
brexit
is
frankly
madness
aston
martin
ceo
andy
palmer
told
reuters
at
the
company
s
gaydon
headquarters
in
england
where
designers
are
working
on
a
diverse
lineup
of
vehicles
for
the
and
beyond
headlines
have
focussed
on
plant
closures
and
job
losses
ahead
of
britain
s
divorce
from
the
eu
nissan
has
scrapped
plans
to
build
its
new
suv
in
the
country
while
honda
will
close
its
only
uk
car
plant
in
with
the
loss
of
up
to
jobs
though
it
said
the
decision
was
not
related
to
britain
s
exit
from
the
eu
however
many
auto
companies
from
luxury
marques
like
aston
martin
to
brands
such
as
vauxhall
are
working
on
ways
to
survive
after
march
on
the
outskirts
of
london
workers
at
vauxhall
s
operation
in
luton
are
preparing
to
produce
a
new
line
of
commercial
vans
following
fresh
investment
from
the
brand
s
owner
psa
which
they
are
counting
on
to
sustain
over
jobs
while
market
conditions
remain
a
big
unknown
vauxhall
boss
stephen
norman
told
reuters
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
could
present
an
opportunity
to
increase
the
brand
s
market
share
he
is
pursuing
a
marketing
campaign
to
boost
demand
for
the
company
s
modestly
priced
cars
and
suvs
the
continued
investment
by
some
carmakers
and
the
potential
sales
upside
seen
by
vauxhall
reflect
the
conflicting
decisions
and
opportunities
that
brands
face
depending
on
their
size
their
customers
and
where
they
are
in
the
production
cycle
all
automakers
in
britain
will
anyway
have
to
find
ways
make
brexit
work
even
if
only
in
the
short
term
nissan
builds
nearly
cars
and
multiple
models
making
it
hard
to
pull
out
of
the
country
any
time
soon
toyota
builds
just
one
model
in
britain
the
corolla
but
has
only
just
started
making
it
in
an
industry
where
vehicles
tend
to
have
a
production
life
cycle
aston
martin
and
vauxhall
are
as
different
as
two
auto
companies
can
be
now
brexit
has
thrown
palmer
and
norman
into
the
same
precarious
boat
as
like
their
rivals
they
seek
to
minimise
the
potential
harm
of
a
disorderly
british
exit
the
two
companies
have
significant
british
manufacturing
operations
and
together
have
thousands
of
employees
in
the
country
palmer
and
norman
both
said
in
interviews
that
the
impact
of
brexit
would
be
more
complicated
more
pervasive
and
take
longer
to
play
out
than
policymakers
and
the
public
appreciated
for
aston
martin
which
sells
sports
cars
at
prices
well
above
pounds
new
european
tariffs
on
cars
are
not
a
significant
concern
palmer
said
like
other
smaller
players
such
as
bentley
and
mclaren
aston
has
much
larger
margins
on
its
cars
and
extra
costs
can
be
more
easily
passed
onto
wealthy
customers
that
s
not
a
luxury
enjoyed
by
players
what
concerns
palmer
more
is
the
disruption
to
his
company
s
network
of
suppliers
and
its
meticulously
scheduled
production
system
as
he
walks
through
aston
s
gaydon
factory
palmer
points
to
several
rows
of
dashboards
mounted
on
carriers
and
crowded
into
a
corner
of
the
plant
aston
is
building
stockpiles
of
key
parts
in
case
an
abrupt
brexit
results
in
trucks
with
components
getting
delayed
by
chaos
at
british
ports
it
is
increasing
the
days
of
stock
it
holds
from
three
days
to
five
days
and
could
fly
in
parts
if
ports
become
clogged
up
after
march
aston
receives
many
of
its
engines
from
a
factory
in
germany
and
new
border
checks
and
tariffs
could
delay
those
shipments
reverting
to
a
regime
of
tariffs
and
world
trade
organization
rules
after
decades
of
free
trade
would
force
aston
and
its
suppliers
to
trace
and
document
where
all
the
parts
in
a
vehicle
come
from
palmer
told
reuters
when
you
ve
got
parts
on
a
car
and
then
you
ve
got
all
of
the
and
the
you
quickly
get
up
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
parts
and
do
you
honestly
know
where
they
ve
all
come
from
often
not
he
said
that
s
one
reason
why
palmer
said
he
hired
a
supply
chain
chief
an
appointment
announced
last
month
his
obsession
right
now
is
planning
for
brexit
he
said
the
brexit
vote
in
came
as
aston
martin
was
pursuing
a
strategy
unveiled
in
to
go
from
making
about
sports
cars
a
year
to
building
up
to
sports
cars
and
suvs
annually
the
st
athan
plant
will
start
building
dbx
suvs
and
then
is
expected
to
begin
assembling
a
new
line
luxury
electric
vehicles
under
the
lagonda
brand
early
in
the
scrapping
that
investment
is
not
aston
s
plan
people
have
asked
me
what
keeps
you
awake
palmer
said
it
very
much
is
the
supply
chain
and
the
capability
of
that
supply
chain
to
absorb
all
the
macroeconomics
that
are
thrown
at
aston
is
not
alone
in
this
concern
volkswagen
the
biggest
car
seller
in
britain
and
honda
have
both
said
they
are
stockpiling
parts
while
jaguar
land
rover
has
been
talking
to
warehousing
companies
and
bentley
has
leased
storage
space
at
vauxhall
boss
norman
said
brexit
could
be
an
opportunity
for
a
brand
that
struggled
under
its
former
owner
automaker
general
motors
and
is
charting
a
new
strategy
under
french
group
psa
vauxhall
believes
a
brexit
would
lead
to
as
much
as
a
percent
fall
in
british
new
vehicle
demand
but
a
bigger
market
share
for
vauxhall
psa
has
committed
last
year
to
fresh
investment
to
launch
new
models
at
its
luton
van
factory
but
it
faces
a
decision
next
year
on
whether
to
keep
vauxhall
s
ellesmere
port
plant
open
after
the
current
run
of
astra
sports
tourer
ends
that
decision
is
not
a
simple
one
norman
said
it
would
not
be
true
to
say
that
a
hard
brexit
automatically
means
the
closure
of
plants
in
the
united
kingdom
neither
for
us
nor
for
other
manufacturers
but
it
would
certainly
mean
they
come
under
greater
scrutiny
he
said
british
workers
would
have
to
deliver
productivity
gains
that
offset
tariffs
and
supply
chain
friction
currently
vauxhall
which
was
bought
by
peugeot
parent
company
psa
in
accounts
for
percent
of
british
car
sales
added
to
the
group
s
peugeot
citroen
and
ds
brands
the
total
rises
to
percent
making
psa
one
of
the
biggest
sellers
in
europe
s
auto
market
if
the
market
takes
a
hit
vauxhall
s
emphasis
on
functional
economically
priced
models
could
be
an
advantage
norman
said
people
will
look
very
long
and
hard
he
said
and
they
will
say
do
i
need
this
enhanced
brand
strength
which
i
m
actually
paying
for
that
has
no
material
value
or
should
i
not
look
more
seriously
at
the
offer
from
vauxhall
and
have
just
as
good
a
vehicle
and
not
have
to
pay
through
the
nose
for
the
