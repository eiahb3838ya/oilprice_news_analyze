lawmakers
said
guaido
s
vehicle

but
his
exact
location
was
being

said
he
and
some
other
politicians
would
also
travel
to
the
border
with
brazil
the
information
ministry
did
not
respond

a

to
person
and
fleets
of
boats
arriving
from
the
dutch
caribbean
islands
the
opposition
says
it
is
rallying
relief
efforts
in
venezuela
to
alleviate
widespread
food
and
medicine
shortages
in
the
wake
of
its
hyperinflationary
economic
collapse
the
economy
has
halved
in
size
in
five
years

tweeted
late
on

that
chile
was
also
airlifting
supplies
there
while
brazil
s
government
said
it
was
sending
aid
to
its
own
border
meanwhile
a
boat
carrying
tons
of
aid
left
puerto
rico
s
capital
of
san
juan
headed
for
venezuela
on
wednesday
the
local
government
said
in
a
statement
maduro
accuses
the
trump
administration
which
has
levied
crippling
sanctions
against
his
government
of
seeking
to
force
his
ouster
the
special
envoy
for

elliott
abrams
will
lead

accompanying

via
military
aircraft
between

and
friday
the

said
he
would
fly
to
the
colombian
capital
bogota

to
discuss
the
crisis
with
leaders
of
the
regional
lima
group
of
nations
guaido
invoked
the
constitution
to
assume
an
interim
presidency
on
and
denounces
maduro
as
an
usurper
maduro
still
retains
the
support
of
powerful
nations
like
russia
and
china
as
well
as
the
key
backing
of
the
military
some
political
analysts
say
saturday
s
border
showdown
is
less
about
resolving
venezuela
s
needs
and
more
about
testing
the
military
s
loyalty
by
daring
it
to
turn
aid
away
it
s
part
of
this
calculus
that
sees
the
military
as
leading
a
transition
in
venezuela
