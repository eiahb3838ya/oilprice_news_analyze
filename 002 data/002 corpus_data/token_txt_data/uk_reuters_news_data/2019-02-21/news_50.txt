she
believed

clearance
for
the
project
could
in
theory
be
given
in
the
next
several
months
i
would
guess
but
it
is
an
absolute
mess
six
months
to
two
years

chestnutt
said
protests
against
the
mine
were
a
hindrance
and
that
there
was
a
lot
of
misinformation
about
the
mine
that
needed
to
be
challenged

what
she
considered
misinformation
she
said
i
think
people
just
think
that
coal
is
dirty
and
global
warming
is
a
major
issue
and
people
just
like
to
blame
the
coal
business
for
that
carbon
dioxide
for
a
spokesman
for
adani
said
the
firm
expected
to
move
faster
on
the
project
in
future
we
have
provided
all
required
information
data
and
feedback
needed
for
this
process
to
be
completed
and
accordingly
we
expect
to
have
these
plans
approved
in
the
very
near
term
