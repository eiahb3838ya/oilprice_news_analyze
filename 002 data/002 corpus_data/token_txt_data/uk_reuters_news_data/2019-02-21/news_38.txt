mexican

s
race
to
build
an
oil
refinery
in
record
time
on
land
that
was
until
recently
alive
with
mangrove
wild
cats
and
boa
constrictors
has
run
into
trouble
complicating
his
effort
to
revive
ailing
company
pemex
even
before
lopez
obrador
took
office
last
december
work
had
begun
to
cut
down
protected
woodland
on
pemex
land
on
the
coast
of
tabasco
state
to
make
room
for
the
new
refinery
next
to
the
dos
bocas
port
but
oil
industry
environmental
regulator
asea
in
january
ruled
that
the
contractor
that
deforested
the
land
did
not
have
the
correct
permits
to
do
so
the
body
levied
a
fine
of
about
asea
says
work
on
the
refinery
can
only
go
ahead
once
a
full
environmental
impact
assessment
is
done
and
approved
that
could
delay
the
refinery
project
for
months
or
even
years
just
as
the
government
is
trying
to
boost
oil
output
by
giving
the
state
a
bigger
role
in
the
industry
modernizing
refineries
and
building
the
new
one
in
tabasco
lopez
obrador
s
home
state
gustavo
alanis
president
of
the
mexican
centre
of
environmental
law
advocacy
group
said
pemex
will
run
into
legal
problems
if
it
continues
to
act
in
haste
over
the
planned
dos
bocas
refinery
if
they
move
quickly
without
paying
heed
to
the
laws
they
need
to
follow
they
ll
become
their
own
worst
enemy
he
said
the
government
has
said
it
plans
to
tender
for
the
construction
of
the
billion
refinery
in
march
and
finish
building
it
in
three
years

the

at

told
reuters
along
with
a
wide
variety
of
bird
species
and
freshwater
turtles
the
land
was
so
rich
in
wildlife
about
a
decade
ago
that
a
group
of
pemex
executives
proposed
that
it
be
declared
a
private
nature
reserve
to
prevent
future
building
there
company
sources
said
a
study
by
a
government
institute
several
years
ago
concluded
paraiso
was
a
risky
location
for
a
refinery
because
of
the
biodiversity
found
there
but
satellite
pictures
taken
in
november
and
obtained
from
conabio
show
a
wide
belt
of
mangrove
across
the
terrain
has
now
been
cut
down
leaving
a
smaller
perimeter
of
forest

the

what

a
