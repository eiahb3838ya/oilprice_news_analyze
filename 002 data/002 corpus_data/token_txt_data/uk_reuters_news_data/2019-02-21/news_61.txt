investors
have
been
cheered
over

days
by
signs
of
progress
in
trade
talks
the
trade
war
between
the
economic
giants
has
roiled
financial
markets
over
the
past
year
the
united
states
and
china
have
started
to
outline
commitments
in
principle
on
the
most
contentious
issues
in
their
trade
dispute
marking
the
most
significant
progress
yet
toward
ending
a
trade
war
sources
familiar
with
the
negotiations
told
reuters
negotiators
are
drawing
up
six
memorandums
of
understanding
on
structural
issues
forced
technology
transfer
and
cyber
theft
intellectual
property
rights
services

agriculture
and
barriers
to

the
sources
said
as
the
two
sides
push
for
an
agreement
by
march
that
marks
the
end
of
a
truce
that
president
donald
trump
and
chinese
president
xi
jinping
agreed
to
when
they
met
in
argentina
late
last
year
trump
had
suggested
on
tuesday
he
was
open
to
pushing
off
the
deadline
to
complete
negotiations
saying
march
was
not
a
magical
date
sentiment
also
got
a
lift
after
the
federal
reserve
on
wednesday
affirmed
it
would
be
patient
on
further
interest
rate
rises
we
must
be
a
little
bit
careful
that
if
the
trade
negotiation
would
be
ended
with
a
temporary
success
that
could
in
turn
mean
the
fed
might
restart
their
monetary
tightening

yoshinori
shigemi
a
global
market
strategist
at
jpmorgan

management
in
tokyo
on
wall
street
all
three
major
equity
indexes
ended
in
positive
territory
on
wednesday
after
minutes
from
the
fed
s
meeting
indicated
policymakers
see
little
risk
to
leaving
rates
alone
for
now
the
bar
to
restarting
rate
hikes
in
the
near
term
seems
to
be
quite
high
with
several
participants
arguing
that
rate
increases
would
be
necessary
only
if
inflation
outcomes
were
higher
than
in
the
baseline
outlook
paul
ashworth
chief
economist
at
capital
economics
said
in
a
note
the
upshot
is
we
now
expect
the
fed
to
leave
rates
unchanged
throughout
this
year
before
a
further
deterioration
in
economic
growth
forces
it
to
cut
rates

a
total
of
basis

said
the
fed
signalled
it
will
soon
lay
out
a
plan

other
assets

are
still

it
then
reversed
course
