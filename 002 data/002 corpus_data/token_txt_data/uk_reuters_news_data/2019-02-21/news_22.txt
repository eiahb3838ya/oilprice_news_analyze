weekly
crude
production
edged
higher
to
a
record
million
barrels
per
day
the
data
showed
oil
production
has
surged
in
the
united
states
thanks
to
a
shale
revolution
vaulting
the
country
above
saudi
arabia
and
russia
as
the
world
s
biggest
producer
the
continued
surge
in
production
stands
as
a
bearish
dynamic
for
market
prices
especially
as
increasing
volumes
get
sold
abroad
in
a
direct
challenge
to

the

said
analysts

attributed
much
of
the
increase
in
inventories
at

to
ongoing

the

obviously
are
down
more

that
