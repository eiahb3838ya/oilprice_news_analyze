in
a
billion
euro
drive
to
bolster

sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
engie
has
been
criticized
for
being
too
complex
and
and
ceo
isabelle
kocher
is
expected
to
address
this
in
a
corporate
strategy
plan
to
be
announced
next
thursday
when
the
company
also
releases
results
two
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
company
s
plans
said
kocher
was
likely
to
scale
back
the
number
of
countries
engie
operates
in
it
is
present
in
some
countries
notably
in
central
europe
both
said
kocher
would
focus
the
gas
and
power
group
more
strongly
on
grids
and
renewables
after
selling
some
billion
worth
of
related
assets
in
one
of
the
two
sources
a
union
official
said
kocher
would
aim
to
cut
costs
by
billion
over
three
years
extending
a
billion
euro
cost
reduction
plan
in
daily
business
newsletter
la
lettre
a
had
first
reported
that
engie
was
targeting
a
plan
engie
will
also
need
to
acquire
at
least
one
business
too
make
up
for
cash
flow
lost
in
its
move
away
from
fossil
fuels
two
sources
including
a
banker
said
the
plan
will
have
to
involve
major
acquisitions
the
planets
are
aligned
but
the
target
remains
to
be
decided
one
of
them
said
potential
targets
include
the
transportadora
associada
de
g√°s
pipeline
owned
by
petrobras
dutch
renewables
utility
eneco
or
the
renewable
energy
assets
of
portugual
s
edps
sources
said
engie
cut
is
net
debt
to
core
earnings
ratio
to
at
the
end
of
from
two
years
earlier
it
can
further
boost
its
financial
firepower
by
selling
part
of
its
percent
stake
in
french
gas
transport
firm
grtgaz
which
will
become
possible
under
the
government
s
new
loi
pacte
law
engie
declined
to
comment
on
strategy
or
potential
targets
ahead
of
next
week
s
presentation
more
than
anything
kocher
and
new
chairman
clamadieu
have
to
come
with
plan
that
reduces
engie
s
conglomerate
discount
and
boosts
its
shares
this
is
because
the
government
s
plan
to
cut
its
percent
holding
will
remove
engie
s
best
defense
against
activist
investors
for
now
the
state
s
presence
is
a
deterrent
for
activist
investors
but
once
it
leaves
engie
becomes
a
possible
target
said
an
investment
banker
familiar
with
the
company
s
thinking
activist
investor
elliott
management
s
acquisition
of
a
percent
stake
in
drinks
firm
pernod

in
december
has
focused
minds
across
france
s
bluechip
index
on
the
need
for
a
clear
strategy
attractive
valuation
and
close
relationships
with
major
shareholders
at
german
rival
uniper
the
presence
of
elliott
and
activist
investor
knight
vinke
has
become
a
source
of
tension
in
the
company
s
relationship
with
finnish
shareholder
fortum
engie
s
deeply
discounted
stock
price
shows
the
valuation
potential
of
splitting
off
some
of
the
group
s
assets
with
a
ratio
engie
is
the
undervalued
share
in
the
stoxx
european
utilities
index
with
only

engie

is
due
to
its
complexity
one
banker
said
a
large
institutional
investor
said
the
company
was
a
black
box
incomprehensible
to
investors
bankers
and
advisers
say
kocher
s
biggest
problem
engie
s
nuclear
assets
in

may
offer
its
strongest
defense

its
seven
nuclear
plants
there
when
an
activist
takes
aim
at
a
company
it
is
usually
because
he
sees
something
that
management
doesn
t
but
i
don
t
see
what
solution
an

could
bring
for
