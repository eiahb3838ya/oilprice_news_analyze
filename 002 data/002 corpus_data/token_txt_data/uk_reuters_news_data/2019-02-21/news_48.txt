the
united
states
and
china
were
tackling
some
of
the
stickiest
issues
in
their
trade
war
kept
world
shares
near
a
high
on
thursday
though
it
could
not
prevent
a
favourite
chinese
proxy
the
aussie
dollar
hitting
the
skids
a
brief
rise
in
the
euro
and
bond
yields
after
some
slightly
brighter
french
data
and
some
poor
company
earnings
made
for
a
low
key
start
for
the
main
ftse
dax
and
cac
bourses
asian
trading
had
been
far
more
eventful
though
msci
s
main
index
rose
to
a
month
high
after
sources
told
reuters
and
chinese
negotiators
were
drawing
up
six
memorandums
of
understanding
to
solve
their
trade
feud
they
include
forced
technology
transfer
and
cyber
theft
intellectual
property
rights
services
currency
agriculture
and
barriers
to
trade
the
sources
said
adding
the
sides
were
pushing
for
an
agreement
by
march
the
deadline
after
which
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
will
ratchet
up
the
big
mover
though
was
the
aussie
dollar
it
slumped
more
than
percent
after
one
of
the
country
s
big
banks
westpac
called
for
two
rba
rate
cuts
this
year
and
reuters
reported
that
the
chinese
port
of
dalian
had
banned
imports
of
australian
coal
coal
is
australia
s
biggest
export
earner
it
is
hard
know
how
much
of
this
is
in
the
price
considering
the
fall
we
saw
from
the
aussie
dollar
last
year
said
state
street
s
emea
head
of
macro
strategy
tim
graf
it
is
still
up
this
year
however
which
means
there
is
totally
scope
for
further
downside
the
aussie
was
last
trading
at
down
percent
on
the
day
but
it
was
not
the
only
one
struggling
the
kiwi
dollar
got
bundled
down
percent
and
the
euro
had
given
back
its
early
gains
to
stand
at
french
pmis
had
been
reassuring
but
were
then
followed
by
news
that
euro
zone
factory
output
had
unexpectedly
slammed
into
reverse
last
month
as
activity
in
europe
s
manufacturing
powerhouse
germany
declined
again
ihs
markit
s

composite

index
which
is
seen
as
a
good
guide
to
economic
health
rose
to
this
month
from
a
final
january
reading
of
above
a
reuters
poll
median
expectation
for
but
still
below
where
it
has
been
for
much
of
the
past
four
years
the
euro
zone
economy
remained
close
to
stagnation
in
february
the
general
picture
remained
one
of
a
more
subdued
business
environment
than
seen
throughout
much
of
last
year
chris
williamson
ihs
markit
s
chief
business
economist
said
williamson
said
the
results
pointed
to
euro
zone
growth
of
just
percent
below
the
latest
reuters
poll
estimate
for
percent
they
come
soon
after
the
european
central
bank
ended
its
more
than
trillion
euro
asset
purchase
stimulus
programme
the
slide
in
the
aussie
dollar
had
helped
its
share
market
close
at
a
high
japan
s
nikkei
had
ended
percent
stronger
too
and
though
chinese
shares
sagged
the
offshore
yuan
firmed
to
its
strongest

since

hopes
sterling
shrugged
off
fitch
putting
its
uk
credit
rating
on
a
formal
downgrade
warning
amid
uncertainty
about
whether
the
country
s
parliament
will
be
able
to
agree
a
transition
deal
before
next
month
s
planned
brexit
date
stock
futures
were
up
percent
after
the
federal
reserve
on
wednesday
affirmed
it
would
be
patient
on
further
interest
rate
rises
and
that
the
economy
remained
fundamentally
strong
the
central
bank
also
signalled
it
would
soon
lay
out
a
plan
to
stop
letting
go
of
trillion
in
bonds
and
other
assets
though
policymakers
are
still
debating
how
long
their
newly
adopted
patient
stance
on
rates
will
last
the
bar
to
restarting
rate
hikes
in
the
near
term
seems
to
be
quite
high
with
several
participants
arguing
that
rate
increases
would
be
necessary
only
if
inflation
outcomes
were
higher
than
in
the
baseline
outlook

more

that

will
