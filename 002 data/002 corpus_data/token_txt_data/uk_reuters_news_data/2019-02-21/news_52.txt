at
china

northern
port
of
dalian
has
banned
imports
of
australian

and
will
cap
overall

from
all

group
told
reuters
on
thursday
the
indefinite
ban
on
imports
from
top
supplier
australia
effective
since
the
start
of
february
comes
as
major
ports
elsewhere
in
china
prolong
clearing
times
for
australian
coal
to
at
least
days
coal
is
australia
s
biggest
export
earner
and
the
australian
dollar
tumbled
on
the
news
falling
more
than
percent
to
as
low
at
five

said
the

coal
imports
from
russia
and
indonesia
will
not
be
affected
i
m
aware
of
unconfirmed
and
unsourced
media
reports
and
have
asked
our
ambassador
in
beijing
to
urgently
clarify
their
veracity
said
australia
s
minister
for
trade
simon
birmingham
we
continue
to
engage
closely
with
industry
on
matters
of
market
access
china
is
a
valued
partner
of
australia
and
we
trust
that
our
free

will
continue
to
be
birmingham
also
said
that
australia
s
exports
of
coal
to
china
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
were
higher
in
volume
and
value
than
in
the
same
period
in
the
dalian
ports
handled
about
million
tonnes
of
coal
last
year
half
of
which
was
from
australia
said
gu
meng
an
analyst
at
orient
futures
the
dalian
official
declined
to
be
named
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
matter
neither
dalian
customs
nor
the
national
general
administration
of
customs
immediately
responded
to
a
request
for
comment
the
dalian
official
said
he
was
not
given
a
reason
for
the
ban
on
australian
imports
however
it
follows
simmering
tensions
between
beijing
and
canberra
over
issues
such
as
cyber
security
and
china
s
influence
over
island
nations
in
the
pacific
ocean
australia
recently
revoked
the
visa
of
a
prominent
chinese
businessman
further
straining
ties
asked
if
the
ban
was
related
to
bilateral
tensions
geng
shuang
a
spokesman
at
china
s
foreign
ministry
told
reporters
on
thursday
that
customs
were
inspecting
and
testing
coal
imports
for
safety
and
quality
the
goals
are
to
better
safeguard
the
legal
rights
and
interests
of
chinese
importers
and
to
protect
the
environment
he
said
adding
that
the
move
was
completely
normal
australia
s
new
hope
coal
declined
to
comment
yancoal
said
it
will
not
be
impacted
by
the
dalian
ban
as
it
does
not
ship
to
the
port
glencore
directed
queries
to
the
minerals
council
of
australia
which
declined
to
comment
beijing
has
been
trying
to
restrict
imports
of
coal
more
generally
to
support
domestic
prices
a
coal
trader
said
dalian
had
cleared
about
million
tonnes
of
coal
in
january
that
had
been
delayed
since
late
as
china
slowed
customs
clearance
to
curb
imports
the
delayed
cargoes
would
not
be
included
in
the
million
tonnes
under
the
quota
he
added
citing
customs
information
dalian
handles
both
thermal
and
coking
coal
imports
but
the
clamp
down
is
expected
to
have
a
bigger
impact
on
coking
coal
used
in
steel
making
than
thermal
coal
used
to
generate
electricity
spot
australian
coking
coal
at
the
northern
chinese
port
of
jingtang
is
yuan
cheaper
per
tonne
than
domestic
prices
according
to
data
tracked
by
orient
futures
the
price
difference
for
thermal
coal
is
about
the
same
it
is
hard
to
find
a
replacement
for
australian
coking
coal
since
its
sulphur
content
is
very
low
said
a
purchasing
manager
at
a
large
plant
in
hebei
province
that
produces
coke
used
in
the
steelmaking
process
from
coking
coal
current
inventory
at
ports
should
be
sufficient
to
support
usage
for
one
or
two
months
but
it
could
be
a
problem
in
the
long
term
especially
if
other
ports
also
tighten
imports
he
added
he
declined
to
be
named
due
to
company
policy
the
coking
coal
contract
for
may
delivery
rose
more
than
percent
during
morning
trade
on
thursday
the
restriction
will
further
squeeze
profit
margins
at
steel
mills
after
vale
s
accident
has
already
driven
up
iron
ore
prices
said
gu
at
orient
futures
china
bought
million
tonnes
of
coking
coal
from
australia
in
accounting
for
percent
of
