the
amount
of
future
new
wind
capacity
in
europe
financed
last
year
rose
to
a
record
high
industry
group
windeurope
said
on
thursday
as
falling
costs
and
increased
competition
made
it
possible
for
investors
to
fund
more
for
less

than

windeurope
said
in
its
annual
report
funding
for
the
new
investments
rose
to
billion
euros
billion
pounds
even
though
percent
more
future
capacity
was
invested
in
the
amount
spent
on
the
investments
was
percent
more
than
a
year
earlier
a
sign
that
costs
continue
to
fall
cost
reductions
across
the
industry
s
value
chain
and
increased
industry
competition
have
made
it
possible
for
investors
to
finance
more
capacity
for
less
cash
it
said
the
cost
of
generating
electricity
from
wind
power
fell
to
million
euros
per
megawatt
mw
in
from
million
in
windeurope
said
however
the
report
distinguishes
between
finance
for
future
projects
over
the
next
few
years
and
farms
actually
installed
saying
the
amount
of
capacity
newly
installed
last
year
fell
last
year
was
the
worst
year
for
new
wind
energy
installations
since
eu
countries
didn
t
install
a
single
wind
turbine
last
year
said
windeurope
s
chief
executive
giles
dickson
in
the
european
union
member
nations
plus
switzerland
norway
and
turkey
the
amount
of
capacity
added
last
year
was
gigawatts
gw
percent
less
than
in
due
to
poorly
designed
auctions
and
issues
with
permits
the
report
said
in
the
eu
bloc
new
wind
installations
fell
to
gw
the
lowest
level
since
investments
in
future
capacity
were
quite
good
last
year
thanks
to
the
uk
spain
sweden
and
thanks
also
to
the
further
expansion
of
offshore
wind
dickson
said
but
the
outlook
for
new
investments
is
uncertain
there
are
structural
problems
in
permitting
especially
in
germany
and
france
and
with
the
notable
exception
of
lithuania
and
despite
improvements
in
poland
there
s
a
lack
of
ambition
in
central
and
eastern
europe
he
added
in
total
gw
of
wind
power
capacity
is
now
installed
in
europe
percent
higher
than
in
that
accounts
for
percent
of
the
eu
