lopez

is
betting
on

has
long
been
a
critic
of
his
predecessor
s
liberalization
of
the
energy
industry
which
allowed
private
and
foreign
companies
to
bid
for
oil
exploration
and
production
both
alone
and
in
association
with
pemex
lopez
obrador
who
is
from

tabasco
has
previously
said
he
will
give
companies
three
years
to
start
producing
before
he
decides
whether
to
allow
more
auctions
he
has
not
been
clear
whether
this
also
applies
to
pemex
joint
ventures
in
december
a
few
days
after
lopez
obrador
took
office
the
national
hydrocarbons
commission
canceled
two
auctions
for
private
energy
companies
set
for
february
but
it
chose
to
delay
until
rather
than
cancel
a
round
of
auctions
