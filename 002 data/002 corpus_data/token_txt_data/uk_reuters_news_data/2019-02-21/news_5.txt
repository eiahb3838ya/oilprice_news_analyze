with
california
over
federal
plans
to
roll
back
fuel
economy
rules
the
white
house
said
on
thursday
setting
the
stage
for
what
could
be
a
lengthy
legal
fight
over
the
state
s
ability
to
regulate
greenhouse
gas
emissions
california
could
be
joined
in
any
court
fight
by
other
states
that
have
adopted
its
standards
and
want
stricter
rules
to
fight
climate
change
several
other
states
have
also
demanded
the
administration
abandon
its
august
proposal
to
freeze
federal
fuel
efficiency
standards
after
and
take
away
california
s
ability
to
impose
stricter
emissions
rules
the
administration
has
said
tighter
emissions
controls
would
make
automobiles
too
expensive
the
administration
is
moving
forward
to
finalize
a
rule
later
this
year
with
the
goal
of
promoting
safer
cleaner
and
more
affordable
vehicles
the
white
house
said
in
a
statement
california
has
been
allowed
to
set
state
standards
that
are
stricter
than
federal
rules
under
an
exemption
granted
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
the
administration
wants
to
revoke
that
waiver
saying
california
should
not
dictate
policy
for
the
rest
of
the
country
and
arguing
that
another
law
california
from
setting
its
own
vehicle
rules
california
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
said
the
administration
s
decision
to
scrap
the
talks
was
a
sign
of
its
weakness
and
california
and
states
throughout
america
are
prepared
to
defend
our
national
clean
car
standards
even
if
the
trump
administration
intends
to
go
awol

the

of
negotiations
was
general
motors
said
it
was
disappointed
that
the
talks
ended
gm
ford
motor
co
and
fiat
chrysler
automobiles
generate
most
of
their
global
profits
from
sales
of
large
pickup
trucks
and
sport
utility
vehicles
all
three
have
discontinued
or
plan
to
drop
small
and
sedans
from
their
lineups
making
it
harder
for
their
fleets
to
meet
tighter
emissions
standards
we
continue
to
prioritize
the
need
for
one
national
program
and
remain
hopeful
that
the
parties
can
find
a
solution
to
achieve
this
goal
gm
said
adding
that
it
was
committed
to
an
ford
said
that
it
wanted
regulatory
certainty
not
protracted
a
coordinated
program
with
every
stakeholder
is
in
the
best
interest
of
ford
s
customers
and
is
the
best
path
forward
to
achieve
reductions
in
carbon
dioxide
emissions
joe
hinrichs
ford
president
of
global
operations
said
in
a
statement
an
administration
official
familiar
with
the
negotiations
said
california
had
failed
to
compromise
instead
the
official
said
the
state
insisted
on
sticking
with
tougher
mandates
and
it
would
offer
only
a
short
extension
in
applying
them
the
official
also
said
california
demanded
that
the
federal
government
surrender
authority
to
set
emissions
and
economy
standards
for
the
rest
of
the
country
trump
escalated
his
administration
s
power
struggle
with
california
on
tuesday
when
the
administration
canceled
million
in
federal
funds
for
a
california
rail
project
the
state
s
governor
said
the
move
was
in
retaliation
for
california
leading
a
coalition
challenging
trump
s
national
emergency
to
obtain
funds
for
building
a
border
wall
rules
would
require
automakers
roughly
to
double
average
fuel
efficiency
by
sharply
reducing
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
which
is
linked
to
climate
change
it
was
one
of
that
administration
s
most
significant
climate
policy
actions
senator
tom
carper
of
delaware
one
of
states
that
had
adopted
california
s
standards
said
he
was
deeply
disappointed
by
failure
of
the
talks
repeatedly
i
have
urged
this
administration
to
strike
a
deal
with
the
state
of
california
and
seize
the
opportunity
to
keep
the
american
auto
industry
globally
competitive
and
create
more
good
paying
jobs
here
at
home
while
protecting
our
environment
