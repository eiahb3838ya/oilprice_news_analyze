eager
to
start
developing

trillion
cubic
feet
billion
cubic
meters
of
gas
in
the
surat
basin
in
queensland
to
turn
around
arrow
energy
one
of
its
key
overseas
assets
it
is
at
the
mercy
of

a
liquefied
natural
gas
plant
on
an
island
off
queensland
state
petrochina
as
a
stakeholder
in
arrow
expects
to
maximise
interests
from
the
jv
versus
qclng
but
for
shell
it
may
be
thinking
of
using
its
operator
role
at
qclng
to
protect
its
interests
said
a
chinese
oil
industry
executive
who
declined
to
be
named
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
issues
petrochina
s
investment
is
already
bleeding
and
the
firm
wants
to
cut
losses
hoping
not
to
make
further
bad
investment
decisions
the
executive
said
shell
and
petrochina
acquired
the
surat
gas
resource
in
a
a
billion
billion
pounds
takeover
of
arrow
in
they
had
expected
to
reach
a
final
investment
decision
on
the
surat
project
in
with
first
production
around
after
the
arrow
venture
signed
a
deal
at
to
supply
gas
from
surat
to
qclng
petrochina
though
is
unhappy
with
the
price
in
the
sales
agreement
with
qclng
and
the
technical
plan
for
developing
the
gas
this
is
now
holding
up
final
approvals
according
to
three
industry
sources
familiar
with
the
talks
who
declined
to
be
named
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
matter
shell
australia
chairman
zoe
yujnovich
said
on
that
it
is
working
through
chinese
approval
processes
right
up
to
senior
levels
of
beijing
s
powerful
state
planner
the
national
development
and
reform
commission
shell
still
hopes
to
secure
approval
in
time
to
deliver
first
gas
in
yujnovich
said
but
it
is
an
area
we
re
going
to
have
work
really
carefully
on
particularly
the
chinese
approval
processes
as
we
step
through
the
next
phase
she
said
when
asked
whether
gas
pricing
was
in
contention
a
shell
spokeswoman
said
that
shell
supports
both
arrow
and
qgc
in
developing
the
surat
gas
project
qgc
is
the
shell
subsidiary
holding
the
company
s
stake
in
qclng
the
project
would
help
unlock
the
majority
of
arrow
s
reserves
for
both
the
domestic
and
export
markets
the
spokeswoman
said
petrochina
said
in
an
email
to
reuters
that
talks
on
investment
and
cooperation
in
australia
s
arrow
project
are
still
ongoing
without
responding
to
a
question
about
the
pricing
dispute
petrochina
s
takeover
of
arrow
with
shell
in
was
its
first
investment
in
australia
s
coal
seam
gas
sector
seen
as
a
key
acquisition
at
the
time
but
it
has
been
a
big
over
the
five
years
through
the
latest
year
available
petrochina
has
reported
losses
of
billion
yuan
billion
pounds
on
its
share
of
arrow
s
earnings
arrow
energy
said
in
december
that
it
had
suspended
engineering
design
work
on
a
group
of
proposed
expansion
wells
to
reallocate
spending
to
another
area
of
the
project
it
deferred
all
questions
about
timing
or
investment
to
shell
and
petrochina
qclng
is
one
of
three
lng
export
plants
built
in
queensland
all
fed
by
coal
seam
gas
qclng
and
one
of
its
rivals
are
struggling
to
operate
at
full
capacity
as
coal
seam
gas
wells
have
proven
to
be
less
productive
than
expected
this
has
led
to
concerns
that
qclng
may
have
to
shut
one
of
its
two
processing
units
by
if
more
gas
isn
t
brought
into
production
