foundation
three
colorado
communities
filed
a
lawsuit
against
oil
companies
on
tuesday
launching
the
latest
legal
battle
seeking
damages
for
what
they
claim
are
the
costs
of
adapting
to
climate
change
the
lawsuit
filed
in
colorado
by
the
city
of
boulder
and
the
counties
of
san
miguel
and
boulder
accuses
suncor
and
exxon
mobil
corp
of
creating
a
public
nuisance
by
producing
and
selling
fossil
fuels
that
cause
climate
change
scientific
consensus
holds
that
carbon
dioxide
pollution
from
burning
fossil
fuels
such
as
oil
gas
and
coal
is
the
main
cause
of
climate
change
suncor
and
exxon
sold
and
promoted
fossil
fuels
knowing
that
climate
impacts
were
substantially
certain
to
occur
if
unchecked
fossil
fuel
use
continued
the
communities
said
in
the
complaint
exxon
spokesman
scott
silvestri
called
the
lawsuit
part
of
a
misplaced
effort
to
pin
the
global
phenomenon
of
climate
change
on
oil
producers
alone
exxon
is
the
world
s
largest
publicly
traded
oil
producer
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
is
a
global
issue
and
requires
global
participation
and
actions
he
said
in
emailed
comments
a
spokeswoman
for
suncor
one
of
canada
s
biggest
oil
producers
said
the
company
could
not
comment
because
it
had
not
yet
seen
a
copy
of
the
lawsuit
both
exxon
and
suncor
have
operations
in
colorado
the
complaint
said
the
lawsuit
is
the
latest
in
a
growing
body
of
legal
action
against
oil
companies
over
climate
change
however
earlier
cases
have
been
filed
by
coastal
communities
including
california
and
new
york
and
this
is
the
first
to
be
brought
in
the
nation
s
interior
officials
behind
the
lawsuit
said
their
region
of
colorado
is
vulnerable
to
a
wide
range
of
climate
threats
from
droughts
that
imperil
farming
to
warm
winters
that
harm
the
ski
industry
they
said
climate
change
is
not
just
about
sea
level
rise
it
affects
all
of
us
in
the
middle
of
the
country
as
well
said
elise
jones
a
boulder
county
commissioner
in
a
statement
the
case
is
part
of
a
growing
trend
said
michael
burger
executive
director
of
the
sabin
center
for
climate
change
law
at
columbia
university
in
new
york
this
is
now
i
think
the
tenth
lawsuit
of
the
sort
that
has
been
filed
in
the
united
states
against
fossil
fuel
companies
seeking
damages
for
costs
associated
with
climate
change
impacts
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
january
the
san
francisco
suburb
of
richmond
filed
a
similar
climate
public
nuisance
lawsuit
against
oil
companies
including
exxon
