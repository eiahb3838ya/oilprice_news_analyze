interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
said
on
tuesday
he
will
not
lower
royalty
rates
for
offshore
oil
and
gas
lease
sales
at
this
time
despite
a
recommendation
from
an
advisory
panel
to
do
so
zinke
cited
the
success
of
president
donald
trump
s
energy
strategy
as
a
reason
for
not
adhering
to
the
recommendation
of
his
appointed
royalty
policy
committee
which
in
late
february
advised
him
to
slash
the
royalty
rate
for
offshore
drilling
by
nearly
to
percent
right
now
we
can
maintain
higher
royalties
from
our
offshore
waters
without
compromising
the
record
production
and
record
exports
our
nation
is
experiencing
