a
report
prepared
for
the
european
commission
has
questioned
the
economic
viability
of
plans
to
build
a
gas
pipeline
connecting
spain
and
france
designed
in
part
to
help
reduce
europe
s
reliance
on
russian
piped
gas
five
sources
told
reuters
the
commission
has
long
backed
the
billion
euro
billion
midcat
pipeline
that
would
more
than
double
the
amount
of
gas
that
can
be
piped
across
the
pyrenees
mountains
that
border
the
two
nations
french
pipeline
operator
terega
owned
by
italy
s
snam
and
spain
s
enagas
want
to
invest
in
the
project
which
they
say
would
give
europe
greater
access
to
spain
s
numerous
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
terminals
midcat
is
also
supported
by
european
union
climate
commissioner
miguel
arias
canete
a
spanish
national
but
the
project
has
faced
opposition
from
french
energy
regulator
cre
who
says
midcat
would
push
up
consumer
prices
without
improving
security
french
gas
network
firm
grtgaz
has
also
questioned
the
need
for
the
pipeline
now
a
study
by
poyry
a
consultancy
appointed
to
assess
the
first
phase
of
midcat
for
the
commission
indicates
the
project
is
unlikely
to
be
economically
viable
it
said
it
would
only
achieve
financially
viability
in
scenarios
with
a
tight
lng
market
it
said
such
tightness
in
the
gas
market
could
be
caused
by
a
sharp
fall
in
algerian
gas
supplies
to
europe
a
scenario
that
sources
said
was
unlikely
experts
said
existing
gas
infrastructure
across
the
pyrenees
is
already
underutilised
even
during
periods
of
high
demand
if
there
were
a
real
demand
for
midcat
the
market
would
already
have
built
those
interconnectors
said
one
of
the
sources
familiar
with
the
poyry
report
the
report
which
has
not
been
published
by
the
commission
but
which
was
seen
by
reuters
will
be
the
basis
for
a
commission
discussion
on
wednesday
of
priority
eu
infrastructure
plans
termed
projects
of
common
interest
pci
the
commission
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
poyry
declined
to
comment
a
spokeswoman
for
terega
said
the
project
is
in
line
with
european
objectives
to
reinforce
flexibility
and
the
project
has
attracted
criticism
from
politicians
and
environmental
activists
by
pouring
billions
of
public
money
into
new
fossil
gas
infrastructure
europe
would
wave
goodbye
to
the
