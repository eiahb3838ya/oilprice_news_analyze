said
in

following
a
hearing
at
the
bankruptcy
court
for
the
district
of
delaware
in
wilmington
through
a
subsidiary
sqn
last
month
asked

to
lift
a
stay
that
prevents
suniva
s
creditors
from
collecting
the
company
s
debts
while
it
is
in
bankruptcy
in
its
request
sqn
said
it
saw
no
reasonable
possibility
of
a
successful
reorganization
within
a
reasonable
time
for
suniva
and
that
it
and
other
lenders
could
no
longer
fund
the
company
through
the
bankruptcy
process
a
public
auction
for
the
assets

papers
at
the
hearing
judge
gross
granted
sqn
relief
from
the
stay
and
at
suniva
s
request
amended
the
company
s
financing
agreement
to
allow
it
to
fund
operations
for
the
weeks
ahead
an
attorney
for
suniva
jeremy
ryan
told
the
judge
that
the
company
was
still
hoping
for
a
positive
outcome
to
the
bankruptcy
case
no
one
is
sure
exactly
what
that
is
ryan
said
this
case
has
a
lot
of
twists
and
suniva
officials
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
following
the
hearing
suniva
filed
for
bankruptcy
a
year
ago
days
before
it
petitioned
the
government
for
trade
relief
the
norcross
company
argued
it
could
not
compete
with
the
cheap
imports
that
dominate
the
market
the
solar
energy
industries
association
the
industry
s
leading
trade
group
fought
the
tariffs
saying
they
would
drive
up
the
cost
of
solar
and
lead
to
thousands
of
job
losses
the
group
also
argued
that
the
tariffs
would
not
be
enough
to
enable
suniva
to
restart
operations
