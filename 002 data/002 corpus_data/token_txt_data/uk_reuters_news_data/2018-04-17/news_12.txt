fell
to
their
lowest

their
third
straight
day
of

shrugged
off
concerns
about
cold
weather
causing
planting
delays
in
the
midwest
you
plant
more
in
the
month
of
may
than
in

on
bargain
buying
after
falling
percent
in

with
additional
support
stemming
from
a
agriculture

well
below

soybean
futures
also
were
higher
with
technical
buyers
stepping
into
the
market
after
monday
s
decline
but

were
kept
in

by

agricultural

at

this

it
will
slap
a
hefty
temporary
deposit
on
imports
of
sorghum
stirring
trade
tensions
between
the
world
s
top
two
economies
china

the
biggest
buyer
of

on
its
commodity
purchases
ripples
across
the
agriculture
sector
