anglo american brazil ceo sees cash flow ‘very close to break even’ this year despite output shutdown after leak
santiago
reuters
two
leaks
in
a
month
a
outage
and
million
in
fines
is
not
enough
to
temper
anglo
american
s
ambition
for
its
dollar
iron
ore
mine
in
brazil
purchased
at
the
height
of
the
commodities
boom
a
decade
ago
for
billion
anglo
american
was
once
counting
on
to
produce
million
tons
of
iron
ore
by
the
mine
s
strength
is
its
iron
ore
that
commands
a
premium
as
the
world
s
biggest
commodity
consumer
china
seeks
to
cut
pollution
is
anglo
american
s
biggest
development
project
and
its
bet
on
the
future
of
iron
ore
but
so
far
it
only
accounts
for
a
small
percentage
of
its
overall
profits
as
it
is
still
in
phase
the
project
has
been
delayed
by
brazil
s
labyrinthine
permitting
process
and
production
is
now
hampered
by
the
leaks
on
the
pipeline
which
will
be
shut
during
a
three
month
inspection
renewed
focus
on
environmental
standards
at
mines
after
leaks
at
the
alunorte
refinery
and
from
anglo
s
pipelines
has
clouded
its
prospects
in
some
investors
eyes
brazil
s
federal
environmental
regulator
ibama
levied
fines
against
anglo
american
of
million
reais
million
related
to
two
spills
last
month
from
a
pipeline
that
carries
iron
ore
from
the
mine
that
was
in
addition
to
million
reais
million
from
the
brazilian
state
of
minas
gerais
on
april
ibama
said
it
will
need
to
evaluate
a
technical
report
provided
by
anglo
after
its
pipeline
inspection
before
it
can
resume
operations
ibama
did
not
provide
a
timeline
for
that
evaluation
anglo
american
executives
are
confident
a
project
that
has
cost
more
than
billion
to
build
will
hit
that
million
ton
production
target
in
and
expect
the
mine
will
soon
break
even
with
output
expected
at
only
around
million
tons
this
year
regardless
of
the
leak
we
expect
a
cash
flow
very
close
to
the
break
even
this
year
anglo
american
ceo
for
brazil
ruben
fernandes
told
reuters
adding
he
expects
the
company
to
get
a
vital
final
permit
from
brazil
some
industry
veterans
see
financial
woes
weighing
heavily
as
anglo
continues
to
pay
fixed
costs
and
stops
receiving
revenue
for
the
expensive
mine
this
without
a
doubt
is
a
setback
for
anglo
said
roberto
castello
branco
a
former
senior
executive
at
vale
and
board
member
at
petrobas
of
the
leak
he
added
it
is
also
a
negative
for
the
brazilian
mining
industry
which
may
now
face
tougher
scrutiny
to
operate
a
mine
in
a
country
that
has
suffered
repeated
environmental
damage
from
mining
it
is
a
situation
in
which
everyone
loses
said
branco
rival
miners
have
already
pulled
back
production
after
their
own
leaks
norway
s
hydro
has
halved
capacity
at
its
alunorte
alumina
refinery
after
a
leak
while
samarco
a
joint
venture
between
bhp
and
vale
has
yet
to
resume
output
after
a
dam
collapse
in
that
killed
people
recovering
anglo
s
initial
investment
was
complex
but
not
impossible
fernandes
said
he
has
not
put
a
figure
on
lost
revenue
during
the
shutdown
over
next
few
months
telling
reuters
that
the
focus
is
on
stable
production
of
million
and
a
half
in
keeping
with
the
project
then
we
will
know
the
cost
of
without
the
permit
to
expand
would
run
out
of
ore
at
the
end
of
the
year
anglo
american
executives
have
played
down
the
pipeline
leaks
saying
the
spills
were
not
toxic
and
swiftly
contained
we
should
be
ready
to
apply
for
the
operating
license
in
the
third
quarter
of
this
year
fernandes
said
the
stakes
for
brazil
are
high
when
it
comes
to
how
strict
its
regulators
get
on
mine
safety
given
the
country
is
to
supply
the
united
states
as
president
donald
trump
s
tariff
war
aims
to
boost
his
domestic
steel
industry
a
more
robust
industry
would
need
more
iron
ore
and
brazil
is
geographically
in
the
right
region
to
supply
it
having
gotten
a
tariff
exemption
if
the
price
stays
high
it
will
be
a
very
profitable
asset
said
steve
magill
head
of
european
value
at
ubs
asset
management
a
top
anglo
american
shareholder
but
we
have
to
acknowledge
that
because
of
past
mistakes
the
company
spent
a
huge
amount
on
it
so
the
return
on
the
total
investment
won
t
be
that
said
anglo
has
outperformed
peers
this
year
in
part
because
of
improved
efficiency
in
production
of
bulk
commodities
coal
and
iron
ore
and
strong
output
from
its
kumba
operations
in
south
africa
for
the
anglo
american
s
most
profitable
divisions
were
coal
followed
by
iron
ore
and
manganese
accounting
for
respectively
and
percent
of
ebitda
rbc
capital
markets
analyst
tyler
broda
said
the
bank
continued
to
see
relative
upside
in
anglo
american
versus
peers
on
a
view
because
it
has
recovered
well
from
crash
cost
cutting
and
improved
efficiency
but
acquiring
permits
remains
a
worry
hennie
faul
anglo
american
s
global
copper
unit
ceo
said
each
country
has
its
own
challenges
but
the
company
s
balance
sheet
was
to
keep
developing
its
brazil
assets
which
also
include
nickel
we
re
certainly
not
trying
to
get
out
of
brazil
