a
bipartisan
group
of
senators
from
farm
states
pressed
the
environmental
protection
agency
on
tuesday
to
stop
issuing
hardship
waivers
from
the
nation
s
biofuels
laws
to
refiners
and
to
name
the
companies
that
already
have
them
the
request
is
the
latest
sign
of
rising
tensions
over
the
renewable
fuel
standard
or
rfs
a
controversial
law
requiring
refiners
to
mix
billions
of
gallons
of
biofuels
into
the
nation
s
gasoline
and
diesel
supplies
that
has
split
the
powerful
corn
and
oil
lobbies
the
epa
has
provided
more
than
two
dozen
hardship
waivers
to
refineries
in
recent
months
exempting
them
from
the
program
in
an
attempt
to
help
the
industry
cope
with
compliance
costs
according
to
an
agency
source
the
agency
typically
issues
fewer
than
a
dozen
a
year
according
to
a
former
official
biofuels
advocates
say
that
excessive
use
of
the
waivers
undermines
the
renewable
fuel
standard
by
weakening
demand
for
biofuels
like
ethanol
a
federal
judge
in
august
said
the
epa
s
criteria
for
awarding
exemptions
was
too
strict
reversing
a
denial
for
sinclair
oil
and
enticing
others
to
apply
the
waivers
are
intended
for
small
facilities
that
would
face
disproportionate
economic
hardship
if
they
comply
with
the
rfs
epa
grants
them
in
secret
arguing
the
information
is
business
confidential
reuters
has
reported
however
that
at
least
one
large
and
profitable
company
andeavor
is
among
the
firms
whose
plants
recently
received
exemptions
and
that
other
big
companies
like
chevron
corp
and
exxon
mobil
also
have
applied
recent
reports
indicate
dozens
of
small
refiner
waivers
have
been
secretly
granted
to
large
companies
under
the
guise
of
the
small
refinery
hardship
exemption
the
senators
wrote
in
a
letter
to
epa
administrator
scott
pruitt
this
is
extremely
concerning
to
us
they
added
the
group
of
senators
was
led
by
republican
chuck
grassley
from
iowa
and
democrat
amy
klobuchar
from
minnesota
both
states
with
significant
ethanol
industries
the
letter
was
dated
friday
april
but
released
by
the
senators
to
the
public
only
on
tuesday
epa
spokeswoman
liz
bowman
said
halting
the
hardship
waiver
program
would
be
a
violation
of
the
rfs
epa
doesn
t
have
the
authority
to
pick
and
choose
which
provisions
of
the
rfs
to
follow
she
said
the
agency
has
been
both
responsive
and
open
about
small
refinery
waivers
while
being
careful
not
to
violate
confidential
business
information
protections
she
added
last
week
five
of
the
senators
called
on
president
donald
trump
to
halt
use
of
the
waivers
temporarily
the
rfs
was
implemented
in
to
help
farmers
reduce
pollution
and
cut
petroleum
imports
the
program
now
requires
the
refining
industry
to
ensure
some
billion
gallons
of
ethanol
are
added
to
the
nation
s
fuel
mix
refiners
must
prove
their
compliance
by
acquiring
blending
credits
either
by
earning
them
or
purchasing
them
from
rivals
oil
companies
have
said
the
credits
are
costly
and
that
the
program
needs
to
be
reformed
or
repealed
john
barrasso
of
wyoming
home
to
several
small
refineries
applauded
the
expansion
of
the
exemption
program
epa
working
with
the
energy
department
must
conduct
a
detailed
objective
analysis
based
on
confidential
business
information
they
must
look
at
each
small
refinery
on
an
individual
basis
whether
or
not
it
is
part
of
a
larger
company
during
the
obama
administration
epa
didn
t
follow
the
law
and
the
courts
rebuked
the
agency
