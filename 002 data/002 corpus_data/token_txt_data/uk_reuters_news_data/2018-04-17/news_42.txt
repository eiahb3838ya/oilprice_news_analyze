the
price
of
seaborne
thermal
coal
in
asia
may
come
under
pressure
as
china
moves
to
impose
some
import
restrictions
on
imports
of
the
polluting
fuel
several
ports
in
southern
and
eastern
china
have
introduced
controls
on
coal
imports
ranging
from
bans
on
unloadings
to
tightening
customs
clearances
among
ports
banning
imports
is
the
chuanshon
anchorage
at
ningbo
port
according
to
a
manager
at
a
coal
trading
house
quoted
by
reuters
on
monday
while
zhoushan
near
shanghai
is
restricting
the
number
of
vessels
allowed
to
dock
what
is
not
clear
yet
is
just
how
severe
these
restrictions
are
how
widespread
they
will
become
and
how
long
they
will
last
what
does
appear
somewhat
clearer
is
that
the
authorities
in
beijing
wish
to
restrict
growth
in
coal
imports
in
order
to
support
domestic
coal
prices
and
encourage
an
increase
in
local
production
certainly
news
of
the
restrictions
boosted
domestic
prices
with
benchmark
thermal
coal
futures
on
the
zhengzhou
commodity
exchange
jumping
almost
percent
on
monday
to
close
at
yuan
a
tonne
this
was
the
biggest
gain
since
august
last
year
although
the
price
is
still
well
below
the
highest
closing
price
so
far
this
year
which
was
yuan
a
tonne
reached
on
while
the
authorities
don
t
officially
target
domestic
coal
prices
it
s
widely
believed
in
the
industry
that
a
range
anchored
around
yuan
a
tonne
is
a
level
that
beijing
feels
provides
miners
with
sufficient
revenue
while
not
unduly
boosting
costs
for
power
generators
it
s
also
currently
a
price
level
that
makes
domestic
coal
attractive
versus
seaborne
supplies
especially
once
the
duties
and
taxes
on
imported
coal
are
taken
into
account
the
spot
thermal
coal
price
at
australia
s
newcastle
port
closed
at
a
tonne
on
monday
up
a
mere
percent
from
friday
s
close
the
price
is
also
down
about
percent
from
the
peak
so
far
this
year
of
a
tonne
reached
on
it
s
not
unusual
for
prices
to
retreat
after
the
peak
winter
demand
period
but
the
risk
for
the
seaborne
market
is
that
the
restrictions
on
imports
in
china
actually
cuts
into
demand
imports
of
all
types
of
coal
rose
percent
to
million
tonnes
in
the
first
three
months
of
compared
to
the
same
period
last
year
according
to
china
s
preliminary
customs
data
while
not
as
fast
a
pace
of
increase
as
in
the
first
quarter
of
it
s
likely
that
the
authorities
would
rather
see
coal
imports
retreat
rather
than
rise
much
will
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
restrictions
being
put
in
place
making
it
key
to
track
imports
to
try
and
calculate
if
they
are
dropping
more
than
what
may
be
seasonally
expected
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
supply
chain
and
commodity
forecasts
suggest
april
may
see
a
drop
in
china
s
coal
imports
filtering
the
data
to
show
cargoes
already
discharged
or
awaiting
discharge
as
well
as
those
already
en
route
to
a
chinese
port
and
expected
to
unload
by
the
end
of
the
month
shows
imports
are
likely
to
be
around
million
tonnes
in
april
even
if
this
figure
does
increase
somewhat
by
the
arrival
of
more
cargoes
from
suppliers
such
as
indonesia
it
s
still
likely
that
april
s
imports
will
be
below
the
seaborne
imports
of
million
tonnes
in
march
the
million
in
february
and
the
million
in
january
reported
by
thomson
reuters
again
a
drop
in
china
s
imports
in
the
shoulder
season
between
winter
and
summer
won
t
be
too
concerning
for
coal
exporters
but
any
sign
of
a
sustained
downturn
will
likely
result
in
prices
of
export
coal
coming
under
pressure
the
domestic
price
of
thermal
coal
normally
tracks
newcastle
prices
although
a
divergence
is
possible
with
a
notable
occurrence
being
in
late
when
seaborne
prices
surged
as
chinese
buyers
stocked
up
for
winter
it
s
possible
that
a
event
such
as
the
current
restrictions
on
imports
could
strengthen
domestic
prices
relative
to
seaborne
cargoes
