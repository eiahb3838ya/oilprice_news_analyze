exclusive-russia's drive to replace western power technology hits snag
moscow

russia
s
drive
to
build
a
large
turbine
to
lessen
its
dependence
on
western
technology
has
suffered
a
major
after
a
prototype
broke
beyond
repair
two
sources
familiar
with
the
project
told
reuters
in
the
past
few
years
russia
has
imported
the
gas
turbines
required
to
run
modern
power
stations
from
firms
such
as
siemens
ge
and
alstom
after
western
sanctions
were
imposed
on
russia
over
the
conflict
with
ukraine
four
years
ago
russian
president
vladimir
putin
urged
officials
to
replace
imported
technology
with
substitutes
in
energy
software
aerospace
and
medicine
the
mishap
with
the
megawatt
turbine
a
capacity
large
enough
to
power
a
sizeable
town
underlines
the
technical
challenges
testing
was
underway
on
a
prototype
mw
turbine
at
the
saturn
engineering
plant
in
rybinsk
central
russia
in
december
last
year
according
to
one
of
the
two
sources
who
are
both
in
the
energy
sector
and
familiar
with
the
results
of
the
tests
the
turbine
fell
apart
said
the
first
source
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
subject
they
tried
to
repair
it
in
time
for
march
but
they
did
not
manage
march
was
the
target
date
for
completion
of
tests
on
the
turbine
putin
in
power
since
won
a
second
consecutive
term
in
an
election
on
march
the
first
source
and
a
second
source
both
said
it
was
not
possible
to
rebuild
the
prototype
turbine
and
the
project
would
have
to
start
again
with
new
equipment
the
turbine
broke
up
said
the
second
source
who
requested
anonymity
because
he
is
not
authorised
to
speak
to
the
media
there
s
no
turbine
that
s
without
any
equivalents
russia
should
in
most
cases
still
be
able
to
buy
turbines
from
western
suppliers
but
and
european
union
sanctions
have
made
it
harder
to
import
western
power
technology
under
certain
circumstances
last
year
russia
clandestinely
delivered
turbines
made
by
siemens
to
a
power
station
in
crimea
which
is
subject
to
sanctions
and
the
european
union
retaliated
by
imposing
extra
sanctions
on
officials
and
companies
involved
in
the
operation
to
the
domestic
turbine
programme
could
hamper
the
modernisation
of
power
generation
if
growing
tensions
with
western
states
result
in
tighter
sanctions
since
russia
s
modernisation
plan
is
focused
on
using
gas
turbines
the
technical
hitch
also
carries
a
potential
political
cost
putin
has
publicly
trumpeted
progress
in
replacing
western
technology
imports
so
any
failures
will
jar
with
the
picture
of
success
he
has
painted
the
new
turbine
is
being
developed
by
a
consortium
of
odk
a
unit
of
conglomerate
rostec
that
owns
the
saturn
factory
where
the
testing
was
being
conducted
russian
state
technology
firm
rusnano
and
state
energy
firm
interrao
in
a
statement
odk
said
one
of
the
mechanisms
of
the
prototype
turbine
had
malfunctioned
it
said
that
would
delay
work
on
the
project
but
could
be
fixed
it
is
not
fatal
for
the
it
said
were
to
be
expected
since
this
was
a
pioneering
project
for
russia
rusnano
acknowledged
there
had
been
an
accident
but
gave
no
details
it
said
it
remained
committed
to
the
turbine
project
and
expects
it
will
be
completed
interrao
declined
to
comment
russia
s
trade
and
industry
ministry
which
oversees
the
sector
declined
to
comment
and
referred
questions
to
rostec
large
capacity
gas
turbines
have
been
in
use
around
the
world
for
years
but
their
construction
is
tricky
to
perfect
because
they
operate
at
extremely
high
speeds
and
high
temperatures
they
need
to
be
engineered
to
very
precise
standards
and
they
use
sophisticated
electronic
control
systems
to
make
sure
that
they
operate
efficiently
for
many
years
russia
made
no
major
investment
in
developing
the
technology
because
it
was
able
to
import
the
turbines
or
the
to
produce
them
a
scheme
started
in
the
to
develop
a
turbine
produced
prototypes
but
they
did
not
go
into
production
at
a
meeting
in
russia
s
second
city
of
saint
petersburg
in
may
last
year
chaired
by
prime
minister
dmitry
medvedev
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
a
mw
turbine
had
been
developed
and
testing
should
be
completed
by
march
this
is
the
first
russian
produced
powerful
machine
with
domestic
manufacture
and
it
will
of
course
help
us
to
completely
substitute
purchases
of
foreign
equipment
of
this
capacity
novak
told
the
meeting
his
ministry
did
not
respond
to
questions
