a
gradual
return
of
risk
appetite
lifted
world
shares
on
tuesday
while
there
were
milestones
aplenty
as
sterling
hit
a
high
and
sanctions
on
russia
drove
aluminium
prices
to
a
peak
chinese
data
that
provided
a
bit
of
something
for
everyone
kept
asia
largely
in
check
overnight
but
europe
started
well
with
only
london
s
ftse
lagging
as
the
pound
s
power
weighed
on
its
big
exporters
there
were
more
signs
of
china
opening
up
its
economy
too
and
a
steadier
russian
rouble
showed
investors
were
also
gradually
shifting
attention
away
from
syria
tensions
back
to
corporate
earnings
and
possible
interest
rate
moves
the
pound
s
rise
was
its
eighth
in
a
row
coming
as
bets
firm
on
another
bank
of
england
rate
hike
next
month
while
yields
on
treasuries
were
at
their
highest
in
over
three
weeks
ahead
of
a
flurry
of
top
fed
speakers
it
looks
like
china
may
be
willing
to
cooperate
with
the
so
that
might
be
spurring
risk
appetite
and
the
positive
mood
in
markets
said
rabobank
analyst
bas
van
geffen
there
were
still
some
trade
war
noises
being
made
though

stocks
beijing
then
said
it
would
slap
a
hefty
temporary
tariff
on
sorghum
imports
after
finding
they
had
damaged
the
domestic
industry
that
set
grain
futures
prices
jumping
economic
data
showed
the
chinese
economy
grew
percent
in
the
first
three
months
of
the
year
unchanged
from
the
previous
quarter
march
retail
sales
jumped
over
percent
too
the
strongest
pace
in
four
months
though
other
figures
saw
industrial
output
miss
expectations
and
investment
growth
also
slowed
underneath
the
stable
gdp
growth
is
quite
rapid
rebalancing
from
industrial
investment
and
old
economy
sectors
to
consumption
services
and
new
economy
sectors
like
tech
this
is
encouraging
said
robert
subbaraman

for
asia
excluding
japan
at
nomura
in
singapore
commodity
markets
were
still
focused
on
the
geopolitical
situation
in
syria
and
the
fallout
from
the
sanctions
on
russia
buoyed
by
growing
expectations
over
tighter
supply
in
the
aftermath
of
sanctions
on
major
russian
producer
rusal
aluminium
prices
jumped
more
than
percent
to
almost
a
tonne
to
hit
their
highest
since
mid
rusal
accounts
for
percent
of
global
aluminium
supply
oil
steadied
at
a
barrel
for
crude
and
a
barrel
for
brent
having
tumbled
nearly
percent
overnight
as
concerns
over
middle
east
tensions
eased
in
another
sign
of
the
returning
risk
appetite
the
euro
rose
above
to
a
high
and
southern
european
government
debt
outperformed
peers
we
have
had
a
long
enough
period
of
extended
volatility
now
that
some
of
the
more
extended
positions
in
risk
assets
have
been
reduced
so
that
is
also
a
positive

added
that
with
so
much
good
brexit
news
priced
in
in
recent
weeks
and
rate
hike
bets
growing
it
was
difficult
to
see
how
much
further
it
could
go
it
was
curbed
slightly
too
after
data
showed
wage
growth
stalled
last
month
despite
the
unemployment
rate
hitting
a
low
president
donald
trump
s
comments
on
monday
about
china
and
russia
trying
to
devalue
their
currencies
continued
to
weigh
on
the
dollar
with
investors
believing
that
the
administration
wants
a
weaker
currency
focus
was
also
turning
to
