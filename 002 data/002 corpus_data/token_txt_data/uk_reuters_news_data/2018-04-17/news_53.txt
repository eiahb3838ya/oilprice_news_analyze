sydney

australia
s
northern
territory
on
tuesday
lifted
a
nearly
moratorium
on
fracking
to
extract
gas
unlocking
vast
onshore
reserves
in
the
region
and
raising
the
possibility
of
other
provinces
following
suit
the
northern
territory
nt
a
million
sq
km
sq
miles
expanse
of
outback
extending
from
the
center
of
australia
to
its
northern
coastline
had
banned
hydraulic
fracturing
commonly
known
as
fracking
in
september
amid
concerns
the
drilling
method
could
harm
the
environment
it
commissioned
an
inquiry
into
the
environmental
social
and
economic
risks
of
the
extraction
process
and
on
tuesday
accepted
the
inquiry
s
conclusion
that
the
risks
were
manageable
the
moratorium
on
fracking
in
the
northern
territory
will
be
lifted
with
strict
new
laws
to
be
in
place
before
exploration
or
production
can
occur
chief

drew
criticism

the
beetaloo
and
mcarthur
basins
for
development
it
immediately
sent
shares
in
commodity
explorers
in
the
region
sharply
higher
even
though
production
is
not
expected
to
begin
for
about
a
decade
it
also
raised
industry
hopes
for
pushing
australia
with
trillion
cubic
feet
of
identified
unconventional
gas
reserves
like
the
united
states
before
it
towards

if
blocks
on

it
now
intends

expand
the
capacity
of
a

pipeline
linking
the
territory
with
the
state
of

sevenfold
given
the
vast
geography
we
are
talking
about
some
significant
infrastructure
investment
will
be
needed
to
bring
this

to

tuesday
s
announcement
lifted
industry
hopes
for
an
end
to
fracking
bans
elsewhere
in
australia
where
the
process
has
become
a
flashpoint
between
a
national
government
desperate
to
quell
rising
gas
prices
and
popular
environmentalist
opposition
victoria
state
has
outlawed
fracking
new
south
wales
and
tasmania
have
introduced
moratoriums
as
has
western
australia
in
its
canning
basin
in
south
australia
a
government
has
promised
a
ban
on
fracking
in
the
state
s
southeast
there
s
been
this
cascading
effect
and
so
one
place
has
a
moratorium
then
the
next
place
has
a
moratorium
said
graeme
bethune
chief
executive
of
energy
quest
an
energy
consultancy
this
should
cause
thoughts
by
other
jurisdictions
about
moratoria
he
said
the
nt
government
said
it
would
tightly
regulate
the
industry
after
lifting
the
ban
almost
half
the
territory
will
remain
including
national
parks
and
reserves
drillers
will
need
to
make
wells
compliant
with
new
design
codes
and
present
plans
for
decommissioning
and
rehabilitation
before
production
begins
it
said
in
a
statement
but
environmentalists
condemned
the
move
this
decision
is
a
betrayal
of
the
science
and
of
the
significant
community
opposition
which
has
been
expressed
over
the
last
few
years
