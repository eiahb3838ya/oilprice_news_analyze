column-world economy at risk from proliferating restrictions on trade and investment: kemp
london
reuters
trade
and
investment
restrictions
are
proliferating
around
the
world
driven
by
a
combination
of
security
concerns
and
protectionist
pressures
in
each
instance
policymakers
can
usually
cite
a
justification
of
why
trade
and
investment
restrictions
are
necessary
but
taken
together
a
thickening
web
of
restrictions
on
transactions
is
imposing
a
growing
burden
on
business
as
well
as
complicating
supply
chains
the
united
states
and
china
have
threatened
to
hit
each
other
with
tariffs
covering
up
to
billion
of
bilateral
trade
in
a
dispute
over
intellectual
property
and
technology
transfers
the
united
states
has
already
imposed
and
countervailing
duties
on
imports
of
steel
aluminium
and
solar
panels
from
china
citing
concerns
about
unfair
trade
china
has
responded
with
its
own
duties
on
imported
sorghum
from
the
united
states
and
is
investigating
other
products
officials
have
raised
security
concerns
about
telecommunications
switch
gear
from
chinese
firm
huawei
and
sought
to
exclude
it
from
the
united
states
market
the
united
states
has
also
suspended
export
licences
linked
to
chinese
telecoms
company
zte
while
britain
has
warned
companies
not
to
install
any
more
zte
equipment
on
the
country
s
network
zte
is
accused
of
violating
secondary
sanctions
on
the
supply
of
equipment
to
iran
and
north
korea
but
there
are
also
broader
concerns
about
its
equipment
being
used
for
spying
and
the
government
has
pledged
to
restrict
chinese
investment
and
acquisitions
in
sensitive
sectors
the
committee
on
foreign
investment
in
the
united
states
cfius
has
already
been
applying
heightened
scrutiny
to
transactions
involving
chinese
firms
in
turn
china
s
antitrust
authorities
have
started
to
slow
down
merger
approvals
involving
western
companies
operating
in
the
chinese
market
the
united
states
has
also
hit
russian
companies
and
individuals
with
multiple
rounds
of
sanctions
in
a
dispute
over
ukraine
in
many
cases
the
united
states
has
imposed
secondary
sanctions
which
apply
extraterritorially
and
aim
to
catch
businesses
for
transactions
that
occur
wholly
outside
the
country
the
european
union
has
implemented
its
own
sanctions
on
russia
though
it
has
generally
refrained
from
extraterritorial
application
the
united
states
and
the
eu
are
both
readying
further
sanctions
on
iran
in
response
to
its
ballistic
missile
programme
and
regional
activities
the
united
states
the
eu
china
and
other
nations
are
enforcing
sanctions
on
north
korea
including
secondary
sanctions
for
activities
the
united
states
also
appears
to
be
preparing
sanctions
on
venezuela
enthusiasm
for
sanctions
is
spreading
with
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
imposing
an
economic
boycott
on
qatar
including
a
secondary
boycott
sanctions
represent
a
relatively
way
of
inflicting
economic
pain
on
an
adversary
and
have
become
the
instrument
of
choice
for
foreign
policymakers
the
art
of
sanctions
a
view
from
the
field
nephew
the
result
is
a
rapidly
growing
complex
led
by
the
treasury
s
office
of
foreign
assets
control
security
services
and
financial
regulators
in
the
united
states
and
the
european
union
the
complex
also
includes
a
growing
army
of
specialist
compliance
firms
and
compliance
officers
embedded
within
businesses
in
addition
to
the
complex
a
growing
number
of
regulators
and
trade
authorities
show
an
increasing
propensity
to
favour
greater
restrictions
the
office
of
the
united
states
trade
representative
the
department
of
commerce
cfius
and
the
departments
responsible
for
antitrust
policy
all
show
a
rising
preference
for
protection
rather
than
openness
mark
for
most
of
the
period
since
and
especially
since
the
end
of
the
soviet
union
the
main
thrust
has
been
towards
greater
openness
on
trade
and
investment
the
dismantling
of
trade
and
investment
barriers
was
embodied
by
eight
rounds
of
successful
trade
negotiations
under
the
general
agreement
on
tariffs
and
trade
culminating
in
the
ambitious
uruguay
round
but
the
liberalisation
thrust
has
stalled
in
recent
years
with
the
failure
to
conclude
any
new
multilateral
trade
agreement
for
almost
a
quarter
of
a
century
the
mark
of
globalisation
may
have
passed
now
trade
and
investment
barriers
are
rising
rather
than
falling
liberalisation
openness
to
trade
and
investment
have
few
defenders
within
the
and
european
political
class
politicians
and
labour
unions
blame
trade
liberalisation
for
stagnating
wages
and
incomes
in
the
advanced
economies
politicians
and
security
hawks
fear
liberalisation
investment
and
technology
transfer
is
strengthening
potential
adversaries
sanctions
experts
financial
regulators
intelligence
agencies
and
foreign
policy
specialists
all
increasingly
employ
trade
and
investment
restrictions
as
their
policy
instrument
traditional
mechanisms
for
resolving
trade
and
investment
disputes
through
the
are
to
handle
the
new
round
of
restrictions
citing
national
security
and
foreign
policy
concerns
complying
with
the
number
of
restrictions
is
becoming
increasingly
difficult
for
businesses
operating
across
national
frontiers
and
is
causing
a
growing
number
of
distortions
setting
aside
the
question
of
whether
restrictions
are
justified
in
individual
cases
there
are
broader
questions
about
the
economic
impact
of
the
proliferating
barriers
if
increasing
openness
to
trade
and
investment
was
a
major
driver
of
improved
efficiency
and
living
standards
in
the
period
does
its
retreat
threaten
to
slow
economic
growth
can
the
spreading
web
of
trade
and
investment
restrictions
often
imposed
at
short
notice
be
consistent
with
a
and
predictable
trading
system
that
facilitates
transactions
if
the
global
trade
and
investment
regime
becomes
less
predictable
will
the
growth
in
international
trade
and
investment
slow
or
even
go
into
reverse
sanctions
are
generally
treated
as
an
extension
of
foreign
policy
a
traditional
area
reserved
for
executive
authority
with
minimal
legislative
and
judicial
oversight
does
that
raise
concerns
about
due
process
policymakers
are
rapidly
embracing
trade
and
investment
restrictions
for
a
range
of
reasons
ranging
from
trying
to
raise
wages
to
protect
strategic
sectors
and
national
security
concerns
but
their
enthusiasm
for
trade
and
investment
barriers
arguably
threatens
the
foundations
of
the
international
economic
system
and
could
end
up
doing
more
harm
than
good
