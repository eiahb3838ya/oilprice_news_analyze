interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
said
on
tuesday
he
will
not
lower
royalty
rates
for
offshore
oil
and
gas
lease
sales
at
this
time
despite
a
recommendation
from
an
advisory
panel
to
do
so
zinke
cited
the
success
of
president
donald
trump
s
energy
strategy
as
a
reason
for
not
adhering
to
the
recommendation
of
his
appointed
royalty
policy
committee
which
in
late
february
advised
him
to
slash
the
royalty
rate
for
offshore
drilling
by
nearly
to
percent
right
now
we
can
maintain
higher
royalties
from
our
offshore
waters
without
compromising
the
record
production
and
record
exports
our
nation
is
experiencing
zinke
said
the
committee
s
late
february
recommendation
to
lower
the
royalty
rate
companies
pay
on
petroleum
produced
in
federal
offshore
waters
to
percent
from
percent
was
meant
to
encourage
more
energy
production
democrats
and
environmental
groups
decried
the
recommendation
as
a
giveaway
to
some
of
the
most
profitable
companies
in
the
world
that
would
rob
taxpayers
of
revenues

devito
the
chair
of
zinke
s
royalty
policy
committee
said
tuesday
s
decision
reflected
improving
market
conditions
for
the
oil
and
gas
industry
last
month
oil
and
gas
drillers
bid
on
only
a
tiny
fraction
of
gulf
of
mexico
acreage
offered
in
the
largest
lease
sale
in
american
history
which
zinke
said
would
be
a
bellwether
of
industry
demand
in
the
region
when
asked
about
whether
there
was
data
supporting
the
policy
committee
s
recommendation
last
month
at
a
senate
hearing
zinke
said
there
was
no
data
yet
but
there
was
an
argument
to
be
made
for
lowering
the
royalty
rate
