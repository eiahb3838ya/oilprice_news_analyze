china
s
shale
gas
production
will
likely
reach
billion

bcm
in
nearly
double

nearly

woodmac
estimated
the
forecast
bcm
of
output
in
falls
short
of
beijing
s
goal
of
bcm
which
was
slashed
by
more
than
half
from
the
government
s
initial
target
set
in
that
means
the
world
s
gas
user
will
need
to
keep
its
imports
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
at
elevated
levels
woodmac
has
separately
forecast
china
s
lng
imports
will
increase
by
a
quarter
to
nearly
million
tonnes
this
year
from
record

in
china
produced

of

last

or
percent
of

china
is
eager
to
materialise
its

to

tingyun
yang
despite
estimates
that
china
is
home
to
the
world
s
largest
recoverable
shale
gas
resource
its
shale
formations
tend
to
be
deeper
more
fractured
and
located
in
densely
populated
mountainous
terrains
leading
to
higher
costs
and
complications
in
drilling
however
state
firms
have
managed
to
reduce
well
costs
significantly
by
percent
for
exploration
wells
versus
and
percent
for
commercial
wells
versus
by
deploying
local
service
companies
equipment
and
improving
drilling
technologies
said

explorations
and
joint
studies
by
global
majors
such
as
shell
bp
exxon
and

have
yielded
little
success
