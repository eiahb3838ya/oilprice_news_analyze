ovl
s
stake

gnop
comprised
blocks
and
and
the
firm
also
agreed
to
build
a
pipeline
to
port
sudan
on
the
red
sea
but
in
south
sudan
broke
away
from
sudan
after
decades
of
civil
war
and
took
control
of
blocks
and
a
part
of
block
meanwhile
because
of
years
of
trade
sanctions
imposed
on
sudan
by
the
only
lifted
in
khartoum
found
it
difficult
to
secure
oil
for
its
refineries
and
asked
foreign
companies
including
ovl
to
sell
their
share
of
oil
from
the
blocks
to
the
african
nation
in
ovl
signed
a

the
sale
of
its
share
of
gnop
oil
sudan
has
not
yet
paid
million
to
ongc
for
purchases
of
oil
in
and
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
matter
ongc
videsh
had
expected
sudan
to
clear
the
dues
after
lifting
of
the
sanctions
last
year
we
are
committed
to
pay
the
money
but
due
to
the
sanctions
imposed
on
sudan
we
are
facing
problems
in
making
payment
said
sirajuddin
hamid
yousuf
sudan
s
ambassador
to
india
the
sanctions
were
eased
on
but
we
still
can
not
have
normal
banking
transactions
with
india
and
others
