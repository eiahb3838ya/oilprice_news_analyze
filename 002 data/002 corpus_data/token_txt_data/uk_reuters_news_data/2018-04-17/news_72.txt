china cuts smog but health damage already done - study

while
china
has
made
progress
cutting
smog
the
damage
to
the
health
of
millions
of
people
may
already
have
been
done
especially
as
the
population
ages
the
head
of
a
research
agency
said
china
faces
about
million
premature
deaths
a
year
as
a
result
of
air
pollution
the
health
effects
institute
hei
said
in
a
report
based
on
data
going
back
to
published
on
tuesday
china
cut
concentrations
of
hazardous
particles
known
as
by
percent
in
cities
last
year
northern
regions
also
met
air
quality
targets
after
a
winter
campaign
to
cut
industrial
output
coal
consumption
and
traffic
nevertheless
deaths
could
still
rise
as
china
ages
and
overall
air
quality
remains
below
the
country
s
own
standards
the
study
showed
people
are
living
longer
and
older
people
are
more
susceptible
to
the
diseases
most
closely
linked
to
air
pollution
the
major
causes
of
death
in
china
like
stroke
heart
attack
and
lung
cancer
hei
president
dan
greenbaum
told
reuters
in
an
interview
we
have
done
some
projections
in
china
up
to
and
even
with
improvements
in
air
quality
you
see
the
number
of
deaths
going
up
as
the
population
gets
older
he
added
the
number
of
chinese
people
over
reached
million
at
the
end
accounting
for
percent
of
the
population
and
up
million
since
according
to
the
national
bureau
of
statistics
the
china
association
of
social
security
a
research
group
expects
the
number
to
reach
million
by
as
the
government
prepares
a
new
smog
action
plan
for
the
next
round
of
measures
could
prove
harder
to
implement
greenbaum
said
the
pollution
itself
gets
harder
to
treat
and
even
though
china
has
been
making
progress
it
has
pretty
much
leveled
off
he
said
he
pointed
to
the
challenge
of
cleaning
up
smaller
factories
that
emit
particles
as
well
as
the
need
to
tackle
other
pollutants
concentrations
of
ozone
caused
in
part
by
urban
traffic
congestion
are
rising
and
experts
say
china
should
target
it
in
its
new
action
plan
authorities
should
also
focus
on
the
countryside
where
indoor
pollution
caused
by
direct
fuel
combustion
is
responsible
for
more
than
a
third
of
total
annual
deaths
the
hei
study
said
inhaling
fumes
from
the
indoor
burning
of
coal
or
biomass
for
cooking
and
heating
is
associated
with
higher
rates
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
in
rural
areas
china
has
provided
incentives
allowing
households
to
switch
to
cleaner
natural
gas
and
biogas
from
pigs
and
cattle
the
number
of
annual
deaths
related
to
indoor
burning
in
rural
areas
has
halved
since
to
the
study
said
however
the
millions
of
migrant
workers
who
moved
to
cities
and
industrial
areas
over
that
period
may
have
replaced
one
serious
health
risk
with
another

at
micrograms
in
china
last
year
but
rose
to
micrograms
in
the
heavy
industrial
region
of

china

to
reach
an
