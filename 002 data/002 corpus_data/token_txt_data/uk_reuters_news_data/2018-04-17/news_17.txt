leftist
president
nicolas
maduro
has
since
last
year
overseen
a
major
crackdown
on
alleged
graft
in
venezuela
with
dozens
of
oil
executives
including
the
former
oil
minister
and
president
of
state
oil
company
pdvsa
now
behind
bars
the
purge
comes
years
after
industry
analysts
and
opposition
politicians
began
criticizing
pdvsa
management
for
widespread
graft
a
report
by
the
congress
in
said
at
least
billion
went
missing
at
pdvsa
between
and
for
years
the
government
decried
such
accusations
as
smear
campaigns
against
socialism
and
in
favor
of
a
coup
but
maduro
who
is
running
for
next
month
later
changed
his
tone
he
now
blames
thieves
and
traitors
for
an
economic
crisis
so
severe
that
disease
and
malnutrition
are
spreading
unchecked
by
a
broken
public
health
system
vowing
a
cleanup
maduro
replaced
many
of
the
jailed
executives
with
soldiers
but
the
major
general
now
in
charge
of
the
oil
industry
has
quickly
alienated
pdvsa
s
embattled
upper
echelon
and
its
spurring
thousands
of
resignations
that
further
threaten
to
hurt
the
ailing
industry
