april
reuters
the
department
of
energy
will
spend
million
to
fund
projects
aimed
at
advancing
solar
energy
technologies
and
smoothing
their
integration
into
the
electricity
grid
it
said
on
tuesday
the
funding
will
be
split
among
four
areas
of
research
photovoltaics
concentrating
solar
workforce
development
and
grid
integration
doe
said
in
a
statement
technologies
that
focus
on
integrating
solar
onto
the
grid
like
power
electronics
energy
storage
and
sensors
will
receive
the
largest
share
of
the
funding
at
million
late
last
year
doe
said
the
cost
of
solar
energy
had
hit
a
government
target
three
years
ahead
of
schedule
prompting
it
to
change
the
focus
of
its
solar
program
to
integrating
higher
levels
of
the
renewable
power
source
with
the
grid
the
most
widely
used
solar
technology
photovoltaics
will
receive
up
to
million
those
projects
will
aim
to
halve
the
cost
of
generating
power
from
the
sun
s
light
by
to
cents
per
kilowatt
hour
doe
said
concentrating
solar
power
technologies
which
use
the
sun
s
heat
to
generate
power
will
receive
million
csp
is
far
more
expensive
than
photovoltaic
solar
panels
and
the
united
states
has
only
a
few
such
projects
job
training
and
other
workforce
initiatives
will
receive
up
to
million
doe
said
the

association
the
industry
s
primary
trade
group
in
washington
cheered
doe
s
announcement
calling
it
a
positive
step
in
strengthening
this
important
relationship
between
the
federal

the
american
solar
seia
has
been
at
odds
with
the
trump
administration
this
year
over
tariffs
imposed

imports
of
solar
panels
in
january
the
group
argued
vehemently
against
the
tariffs
saying
they
would
drive
up
the
cost
of
solar
and
lead
to
job
losses
awards
will
range
between
and
million
