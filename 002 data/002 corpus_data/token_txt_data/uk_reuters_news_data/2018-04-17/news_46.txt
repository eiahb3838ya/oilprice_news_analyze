a
handful
of

waiting
by
an

they
wanted
a
word
with
the
opec

s
oil
minister
and
president
of
its
oil
firm
pdvsa
about
the
sorry
state
of
the

on
by
he
didn

get
out
to
ask
workers
about
what
is
going
on
said
jesus
tabata
a
union
leader
who
works
on
a
rig
in
the
orinoco
belt
that
way
it
s
easier
to
keep
saying
everything
is
fine
and
at
the
same
time
keeping
us
on
like
slaves
on
miserable
what
s
going
on
is
that
thousands
of
oil
workers
are
fleeing
the
oil
firm
under
the
watch
of
its
new
military
commander
who
has
quickly
alienated
the
firm
s
embattled
upper
echelon
and
its

official
workforce
statistics
have
become
a
closely
guarded
secret
but
a
dozen
sources
told
reuters
that
many
thousands
of
workers
had
quit
so
far
this
year
an
acceleration
of
an
already
troubling
outflow
last
year
about
workers
resigned
between
the
start
of
january
and
the
end
of
january
said
union
leader
and
government
critic
ivan
freites
citing
internal
company
data
that
figure
comes
out
of
a
workforce
last
officially
reported
by
pdvsa
at
in
resignations
appear
to
have
increased
sharply
this
year
said
freites
a
prominent
union
leader
at
venezuela
s
major
refineries
in
the
northern
paraguana
peninsula
it
s
unstoppable
he
said
many
of
those
leaving
now
are
engineers
managers
or
lawyers
professionals
that
are
almost
impossible
to
replace
amid
venezuela
s
economic
meltdown
the
pdvsa
workers
and
foreign
executives
told
reuters
pdvsa
and
the
oil
ministry
did
not
respond
to
repeated
requests
for
comment
pdvsa
board
member
and
union
representative
wills
rangel
acknowledged
the
flight
of
talent
is
a
serious
problem
the
massive
resignations
are
worrying
rangel
said
in
an
interview
in
refinery
operations
many
have
the
pace
of
departures
has
quickened
with
the
rapid
deterioration
of
pdvsa
s
operations
and
finances
radiating
pain
through
the
opec
nation
s
economy
now
beset
with
food
shortages
and
hyperinflation
quevedo
a
little
known
former
housing
minister
who
replaced
two
executives
jailed
for
alleged
graft
has
further
poisoned
the
atmosphere
according
to
the
two
dozen
sources
who
spoke
with
reuters
a
stiff
official
who
rose
through
the
national
guard
quevedo
fired
many
employees
upon
arrival
and
urged
remaining
ones
to
denounce
any
of
their
colleagues
who
oppose
maduro
he
tapped
soldiers
for
top
roles
giving
the
oil
firm
the
atmosphere
of
a
barrack
two
company
sources
said
the
military
guys
arrive
calling
the
engineers
thieves
and
saboteurs
said
a
venezuelan
oil
executive
at
a
private
company
who
frequently
works
with
pdvsa
quevedo
is
also
fighting
to
retain
control
of
a
company
increasingly
riven
by
turf
wars
the
ruling
socialists
once
held
together
by
late
leader
hugo
chavez
have
succumbed
to
infighting
under
maduro
a
former
bus
driver
and
union
leader
who
lacks
chavez
charisma
and
has
seen
his
budget
slashed
with
the
decline
in
global
oil
prices
quevedo
has
clashed
with
venezuela
s
powerful
tareck
when
in
february
appointed
a
to
the
pdvsa
unit
that
oversees
joint
ventures
with
foreign
companies
quevedo
removed
the
appointee
and
had
him
arrested
according
to
three
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
incident
which
has
not
been
previously
reported
quevedo
is
an
ally
of
socialist
party
heavyweight
diosdado
cabello
there
is
a
fight
between
diosdado
and
tareck
for
control
of
the
industry
said
hebert
garcia
a
former
army
general
who
later
broke
with
maduro
and
fled
the
country
the
political
turmoil
and
mass
resignations
threaten
maduro
s
government
which
depends
on
oil
for
percent
of
export
revenue
in
the
orinoco
belt
some
drilling
rigs
are
working
only
intermittently
for
lack
of
crews
said
two
sources
there
in
pdvsa
s
refineries
several
small
fires
have
broken
out
because
there
are
no
longer
enough
supervisors
two
sources
in
the
northern
paraguana
peninsula
said
lack
of
personnel
in
export
terminals
have
forced
some
ports
to
cut
back
working
hours
according
to
two
shippers
and
one
trader
oil
production
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
slipped
to
a
low
of
million
barrels
per
day
jobs
at
pdvsa
were
once
coveted
for
their
generous
salaries
and
benefits
including
cheap
credit
for
housing
now
many
pdvsa
workers
can
t
feed
their
families
on
wages
that
amount
to
a
handful
of
dollars
a
month
rampant
food
shortages
that
caused
venezuelans
to
report
losing
an
average
of
kilograms
pounds
last
year
are
particularly
tough
for
oil
workers
tasked
with
grueling
physical
work
in
often
remote
oil
fields
some
oil
workers
have
resorted
to
working
odd
jobs
on
the
side
taking
vacation
to
work
abroad
or
even
selling
their
work
uniforms
red
overalls
for
money
to
eat
some
workers
in
lake
maracaibo
a
production
region
near
colombia
can
no
longer
get
to
their
jobs
according
to
two
sources
there
transport
can
cost
up
to
bolivars
equal
to
only
cents
but
close
to
what
some
workers
earn
in
a
day
now
what
we
ask
each
other
is
when
are
you
leaving
and
for
where
said
one
of
the
maracaibo
workers
who
like
thousands
of
other
venezuelans
emigrated
to
colombia
this
month
even
in
the
bathroom
people
are
talking
about
at
pdvsa
headquarters
quevedo
often
walks
through
the
offices
with
a
half
dozen
bodyguards
who
clear
his
path
according
to
one
current
and
one
former
pdvsa
employee
the
company
s
ongoing
decay
is
evident
all
around
him
in
the
once
polished
office
tower
broken
elevators
poor
cafeteria
food
empty
desks
in
divisions
maduro
has
overseen
the
arrest
of
dozens
of
pdvsa
executives
since
late
last
year
sometimes
at
the
caracas
headquarters
as
shocked
employees
looked
on
workers
now
feel
watched
by
supervisors
and
are
loathe
to
make
any
business
decision
out
of
fear
they
will
later
be
accused
of
corruption
the
sources
said
pdvsa
workers
often
visibly
thinner
sometimes
surreptitiously
hand
out
resumes
to
executives
from
private
companies
according
to
a
source
at
a
foreign
firm
in
a
rare
protest
last
month
angry
oil
ministry
workers
blocked
access
to
the
cafeteria
demanding
better
benefits
and
chanting
that
quevedo
should
resign
venezuela
s
foreign
oil
partners
which
include
chevron
russia
s
rosneft
and
china
s
cnpc
are
increasingly
worried
about
pdvsa
s
rapidly
departing
workforce
according
to
a
sources
at
multinational
companies
operating
in
venezuela
but
as
minority
partners
they
have
little
or
no
sway
over
salaries
and
management
the
foreign
partners
have
also
grown
increasingly
frustrated
with
quevedo
who
initially
asked
for
their
suggestions
on
fixing
the
firm
but
now
appears
towards
reforms
the
sources
said
at
least
one
foreign
company
is
considering
bringing
in
foreign
specialists
to
improve
its
operations
one
of
the
sources
added
but
with
crime
power
cuts
and
shortages
rampant
in
venezuela
luring
foreign
professionals
is
tough
still
in
the
orinoco
belt
some
vow
to
stay
in
the
belief
that
maduro
s
government
can
t
last
we
can
t
give
up
said
tabata
the
union
leader
who
watched
quevedo
s
truck
drive
by
that
day
this
government
is
unstable
and
could
fall
at
any
moment
and
who
will
be
left
