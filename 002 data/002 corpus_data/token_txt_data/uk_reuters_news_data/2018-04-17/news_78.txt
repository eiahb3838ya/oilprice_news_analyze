china
s
imports
of
major
commodities
may
be
losing
some
of
their
strong
growth
momentum
with
gains
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
failing
to
keep
pace
with
those
from
the
same
period
in
at
first
glance
china
s
imports
of
crude
oil
iron
ore
coal
and
copper
looked
to
have
bounced
back
in
march
after
a
poor
showing
in
february
however
the
first
two
months
of
the
year
generally
result
in
some
distortions
in
the
data
depending
on
the
timing
of
the
lunar
new
year
this
year
s
holiday
fell
entirely
within
february
resulting
in
weaker
import
numbers
it
s
always
more
illuminating
to
look
at
first
quarter
numbers
when
assessing
china
s
commodity
imports
and
here
the
story
is
far
more
mixed
crude
oil
imports
rose
percent
in
the
first
quarter
of
compared
to
the
same
period
a
year
earlier
to
the
equivalent
of
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
however
the
growth
rate
in
the
first
quarter
of
was
percent
meaning
that
although
china
s
imports
of
crude
oil
are
still
increasing
they
aren
t
doing
so
at
the
same
pace
as
they
did
in
the
early
part
of
last
year
in
volume
terms
the
gain
still
looks
impressive
with
imports
in
the
first
quarter
some
bpd
more
than
they
were
in
the
same
period
in
however
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
exports
of
refined
fuels
were
about
million
bpd
which
is
about
bpd
more
than
they
were
in
the
first
quarter
of
last
year
this
implies
that
of
the
additional
bpd
of
crude
imported
in
the
first
quarter
of
just
over
a
third
was
exported
as
refined
products
a
further
factor
pointing
to
the
loss
of
some
growth
momentum
in
china
s
crude
demand
coal
imports
also
looked
to
have
rebounded
strongly
in
march
with
a
percent
jump
over
the
previous
month
but
the
gain
for
the
first
quarter
as
a
whole
was
a
more
modest
percent
this
growth
rate
is
still
robust
but
it
is
about
half
the
pace
of
what
was
achieved
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
story
is
even
weaker
for
iron
ore
with
first
quarter
imports
of
million
tonnes
actually
being
percent
down
from
the
same
quarter
last
year
in
the
period
last
year
iron
ore
imports
were
up
percent
from
the
same
period
in
it
would
appear
that
china
s
vast
steel
sector
may
be
taking
a
breather
after
several
months
of
strong
gains
and
the
of
iron
ore
inventories
at
ports
to
record
levels
in
recent
weeks
probably
has
helped
lower
the
appetite
for
imports
however
copper
is
an
area
of
strength
in
china
s
first
quarter
with
imports
of
unwrought
copper
increasing
percent
in
the
first
quarter
a
reversal
of
the
decline
of
percent
experienced
in
the
first
three
months
of
however
it
s
likely
that
some
of
this
gain
is
due
to
a
change
in
regulations
making
it
more
difficult
to
import
copper
scrap
and
thereby
boosting
demand
for
the
refined
metal
overall
the
picture
that
emerges
from
china
s
first
quarter
trade
data
is
somewhat
similar
to
an
australian
government
public
information
campaign
on
terrorism
which
urged
citizens
to
be
alert
not
alarmed
there
is
little
to
suggest
that
china
s
economy
is
slowing
faster
than
expected
and
the
data
show
that
commodity
imports
are
still
relatively
robust
even
if
the
pace
of
growth
is
slowing
it
s
likely
that
a
healthy
moderation
is
the
best
outcome
for
china
just
so
long
as
it
doesn
t
turn
into
something
more
pronounced
in
the
current
quarter
