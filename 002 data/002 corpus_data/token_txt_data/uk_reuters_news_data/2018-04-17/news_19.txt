singapore
s
maritime
and
port
authority
mpa
said
it
is
investigating
a
collision
between
two
tankers
in
singapore
waters
on
tuesday
that
led
to
a
leak
of
liquefied
petroleum
gas
lpg
from

an

leaked

this
posed
no

and
measures
had
been
taken
by
the

crew
to
stop
the
leak
mpa
said
in

statement
as
liquefied
butane
has
a
high

rate
mpa
has
assessed
that
any
leaked
butane
would
have
been
carried

most
of
it
would
have
rapidly
dissipated
