scientists
in
britain
and
the
united
states
say
they
have
engineered
a
enzyme
that
could
in
future
help
in
the
fight
against
pollution
the
enzyme
is
able
to
digest
polyethylene
terephthalate
or
pet
a
form
of
plastic
patented
in
the
and
now
used
in
millions
of
tonnes
of
plastic
bottles
pet
plastics
can
persist
for
hundreds
of
years
in
the
environment
and
currently
pollute
large
areas
of
land
and
sea
worldwide
researchers
from
britain
s
university
of
portsmouth
and
the
department
of
energy
s
national
renewable
energy
laboratory
made
the
discovery
while
examining
the
structure
of
a
natural
enzyme
thought
to
have
evolved
in
a
waste
recycling
center
in
japan
finding
that
this
enzyme
was
helping
a
bacteria
to
break
down
or
digest
pet
plastic
the
researchers
decided
to
tweak
its
structure
by
adding
some
amino
acids
said
john
mcgeehan
a
professor
at
portsmouth
who
the
work
this
led
to
a
serendipitous
change
in
the
enzyme
s
actions
allowing
its
abilities
to
work
faster
we
ve
made
an
improved
version
of
the
enzyme
better
than
the
natural
one
already
mcgeehan
told
reuters
in
an
interview
that
s
really
exciting
because
that
means
that
there
s
potential
to
optimize
the
enzyme
even
the
team
whose
finding
was
published
on
monday
in
the
proceedings
of
the
national
academy
of
sciences
journal
is
now
working
on
improving
the
enzyme
further
to
see
if
they
can
make
it
capable
of
breaking
down
pet
plastics
on
an
industrial
scale
it
s
well
within
the
possibility
that
in
the
coming
years
we
will
see
an
industrially
viable
process
to
turn
pet
and
potentially
other
plastics
back
into
their
original
building
blocks
so
that
they
can
be
sustainably
recycled
mcgeehan
said
independent
scientists
not
directly
involved
with
the
research
said
it
was
exciting
but
they
cautioned
that
the
enzyme
s
development
as
a
potential
solution
for
pollution
was
still
at
an
early
stage
enzymes
are
biodegradable
and
can
be
produced
in
large
amounts
by
microorganisms
said
oliver
jones
a
expert
in
analytical
chemistry
at
royal
melbourne
institute
of
technology
university
there
is
strong
potential
to
use
enzyme
technology
to
help
with
society
s
growing
waste
problem
by
breaking
down
some
of
the
most
commonly
used
douglas
kell
a
professor
of
bioanalytical
science
at
manchester
university
said
further
rounds
of
work
should
be
expected
to
improve
the
enzyme
yet
further
all
told
this
advance
brings
the
goal
of
sustainably
recyclable
polymers
significantly
closer
