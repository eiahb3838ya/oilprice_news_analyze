toronto
reuters
the
canadian
dollar
is
on
course
to
strengthen
in
april
for
the
eighth
time
in
the
last
years
a
sequence
strategists
link
to
seasonal
vitality
in
stocks
and
energy
products
rewarding
investors
who
trade
on
market
patterns
the
potential
to
predict
repetitive
returns
appears
to
contradict
the
hypothesis
of
financial
market
efficiency
still
the
loonie
has
climbed
percent
since
the
start
of
the
month
against
its
counterpart
making
it
the
currency
it
is
playing
out
really
well
again
this
year
said
amo
sahota
director
at
klarity
fx
in
san
francisco
we
lighten
up
our
usd
positions
in
the
month
of
march
knowing
that
in
april
the
canadian
dollar
is
going
to
get
more
strategists
say
the
tendency
for
energy
prices
to
rise
ahead
of
the
summer
driving
season
gives
the
loonie
a
spring
boost
i
think
that
dynamic
is
important
said
george
davis
chief
technical
strategist
at
rbc
capital
markets
the
broader
commodity
complex
and
crude
oil
have
bullish
seasonal
windows
through
the
price
of
oil
one
of
canada
s
major
exports
has
rallied
this
month
to
its
highest
in
more
than
three
years
also
bullish
for
the
currency
the
discount
between
canadian
crude
and
the
benchmark
has
been
cut
in
half
since
march
to
less
than
april
has
also
brought
cheer
to
wall
street
with
the
s
p
climbing
in
nine
of
the
last
aprils
and
on
track
to
do
so
again
this
year
historically
the
canadian
dollar
has
correlated
very
well
with
the
s
p
and
other
indicators
of
risk
appetite
said
mark
mccormick
north
american
head
of
fx
strategy
at
td
securities
investors
willingness
to
take
risk
often
signals
confidence
in
the
outlook
for
the
global
economy
which
is
important
for
a
country
like
canada
to
be
sure
recent
improvement
in
the
prospects
of
a
deal
to
revamp
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
nafta
which
could
be
welcomed
by
the
bank
of
canada
when
it
updates
its
projections
on
wednesday
for
the
domestic
economy
is
not
a
recurring
event
the
canadian
dollar
has
also
outperformed
in
april
against
the
mexican
peso
which
strategists
say
is
the
best
proxy
for
the
chances
of
a
nafta
deal
being
reached
a
percent
april
gain
on
average
over
the
past
years
is
the
best
by
far
of
any
month
for
the
loonie
but
the
currency
has
often
declined
during
the
following
month
and
investors
may
want
to
keep
in
mind
a
stock
market
adage
that
warns
of
a
seasonally
weaker
period
on
wall
street
the
sell
in
may
and
go
away
phenomenon
kicks
in
and
the
correlation
between
equities
and
the
canadian
dollar
starts
to
work
in
the
opposite
direction
