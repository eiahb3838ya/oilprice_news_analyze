has
a
lot
of
gas

the
italian

which
controls
eni
is
keen
to
turn
italy
into
a
southern
european
gas
hub
capable
of
moving
african
supplies
from
algeria
and
libya
and
future
flows
from

italy

gas
imports
have
tipped
away

production
has
stagnated
sonatrach

struggled
to
attract
foreign

that
the
launch

eni
said
the
renewed
collaboration
between
our
companies
enshrined
in
today

agreements
allows
eni
to
make
a
further
important
step
forward
in
a
key
country

and
to
consolidate
further
our
strategic
partnership
with
sonatrach
