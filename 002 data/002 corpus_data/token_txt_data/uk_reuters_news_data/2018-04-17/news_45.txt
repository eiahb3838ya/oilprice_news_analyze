abb
faces
renewed
shareholder
demands
to
break
up
its
sprawling
business
empire
starting
with
ditching
its
struggling
power
grids
division
the
power
and
automation
company
reports
figures
on
thursday
with
investors
braced
for
another
tepid
performance
from
power
grids
its
largest
but
least
profitable
division
that
it
decided
to
keep
in
concerned
by
weak
share
performance
since
then
investors
say
abb
should
simplify
operations
ranging
from
industrial
plugs
and
fittings
to
electric
motors
for
ships
and
factories
abb
is
too
big
it
is
too
complicated
and
the
company
would
gain
significantly
by
achieving
more
focus
said
david
samra
portfolio
manager
at
artisan
partners
abb
s
shareholder
with
a
percent
stake
so
far
we
have
seen
no
evidence
of
an
underlying
improvement
in
power
grids
nor
in
the
company
as
a
whole
he
told
reuters
artisan
which
describes
itself
as
a
investor
said
abb
should
follow
rivals
siemens
and
honeywell
international
in
streamlining
siemens
floated
its
medical
equipment
business
as
part
of
its
drive
to
attract
investors
for
businesses
outside
its
core
industrial
engineering
and
automation
operations
and
separated
its
wind
power
operations
honeywell
which
makes
everything
from
jet
engines
to
thermostats
will
also
divest
divisions
in
contrast
abb
insisted
in
on
keeping
power
grids
which
makes
transformers
substations
and
semiconductors
to
transmit
electricity
despite
pressure
from
cevian
capital
its
shareholder
to
spin
it
off
power
grids
generated
sales
of
billion
in
equivalent
to
percent
of
the
abb
s
billion
in
sales
cevian
argued
abb
was
too
complex
and
projected
separation
would
produce
two
companies
with
a
combined
share
price
of
swiss
francs
chief
executive
ulrich
spiesshofer
said
in
october
that
abb
could
reach
a
franc
share
price
while
remaining
intact
abb
stock
has
lost
percent
this
year
to
trade
around
francs
spiesshofer
has
quit
some
businesses
to
improve
power
grids
performance
selling
cables
and
exiting
the
engineering
procurement
and
construction
business
last
year
abb
has
evolved
significantly
as
we
have
strengthened
and
streamlined
the
business
and
we
are
making
good
progress
against
our
strategic
goals
a
company
spokesman
said
management
and
board
are
fully

investor
ab
abb
s
largest
shareholder
supports
the
strategy
we
believe
the
key
focus
for
abb
is
to
execute
on
the
transformation
of
power
grids
continue
to
invest
for
the
future
and
strengthen
customer
focus
and
cost
efficiency
it
said

abb
as

holding

the
structure

see
limited
growth
and
struggling

fund
manager
andrea
fornoni
said
from
the
outside
there
are
some
areas
like
power
grids
that
don
t
really
fit
for
many
reasons
end
markets
growth
drivers
or
margin
profile
he
told
reuters
i
don
t
think
this
is
something
that
necessarily
needs
to
be
done
over
the
next
six
months
but
over
time
a
stronger
view
should
be
taken
on
thursday
s
results
are
unlikely
to
provide
much
respite
with
power
grids
revenues
and
profitability

christer
gardells
managing
partner
at
cevian
who
wanted
to
split
up
abb
has
said
he
was
disappointed
with
abb
s
performance
since
the
decision
the
decision
the
board
made
a
year
and
a
half
ago
regarding
the
structure
of
abb
seems
to
have
been
wrong
he
told
swedish
newspaper
dagens
industri
this
month
abb
shares
have
risen
percent
since
the
decision
while
the
stoxx
european
industrial
sector
index
has
gained
percent
we
want
to
see
proof
that
the
synergies
and
the
advantage
they
argue
are
there
in
keeping
the
structure
intact
are
materialised
in
higher
growth
and
profitability
than
for
competitors
