scientists
and
companies
working
to
grow
meat
from
animal
cells
will
need
to
minimise
energy
use
and
avoid
fossil
fuels
if
claims
that
cultured
meat
is
better
for
the
climate
than
real
meat
are
to
hold
true
researchers
said
cultured
meat
production
with
high
energy
inputs
could
spur
global
warming
more
in
the
than
some
types
of
beef
cattle
farming
if
the
world
shunned
a
path
said
a
study
published
on
tuesday
by
the
oxford
martin
school
lead
author
john
lynch
a
researcher
at
the
university
of
oxford
said
reducing
beef
consumption
would
help
curb
climate
change
as
methane
emitted
by
cattle
is
a
potent
gas
but
how
best
to
replace
conventional
meat
remained
unclear
we
have
to
dig
into
the
details
a
bit
more
to
know
if
the
substitutes
would
be
as
beneficial
as
claimed
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
it
just
comes
down
to
how
much
energy
demand
would
be
to
produce
a
kilogramme
of
lynch
said
companies
promising
to
bring
clean
meat
to
the
mass
market
many
of
them
based
in
the
united
states
and
israel
had
yet
to
release
information
on
their
planned
production
processes
the
website
of
one
firm
memphis
meats
which
produced
the
world
s
first
meatball
in
followed
by
poultry
in
says
its
meat
cultivated
at
scale
would
use
significantly
less
land
water
energy
and
food
inputs
our
process
will
produce
less
waste
and
dramatically
fewer
greenhouse
gas
emissions
we
believe
that
the
planet
will
be
the
ultimate
beneficiary
of
our
product
it
adds
without
giving
details
of
how
that
would
be
achieved
memphis
meats
has
received
investment
from
business
tycoons
bill
gates
and
richard
branson
as
well
as
multinational
corporations
cargill
and
tyson
foods
david
welch
director
of
science
and
technology
at
the
good
food
institute
a
nonprofit
that
supports
companies
producing
clean
meat
said
it
would
likely
be
another
five
to
years
before
cultured
meat
products
were
commercially
available
to
consumers
development
work
was
still
being
carried
out
in
labs
with
production
facilities
yet
to
be
set
up
he
added
the
oxford
martin
school
study
said
research
on
greener
ways
of
producing
cultured
meat
was
a
priority
at
this
nascent
stage
its
study
used
four
hypothetical
cultured
meat
production
methods
concluding
the
most
would
not
warm
the
planet
more
than
farming
beef
in
the
long
term
even
without
decarbonisation
of
the
global
energy
system
if
the
real
clean
meat
production
processes
are
like
that
one
then
there
is
no
problem
said
lynch
livestock
are
responsible
for
about
percent
of
global
greenhouse
gas
emissions
according
to
the
united
nations
food
and
agriculture
organization
the
good
food
institute
plans
this
year
to
carry
out
an
study
of
the
environmental
effects
of
cultured
meat
production
with
companies
to
deepen
understanding
of
the
risks
and
benefits
including
for
land
water
and
the
climate
the
oxford
research
highlighted
a
huge
difference
in
the
amount
of
time
for
which
different
greenhouse
gases
influence
the
climate
methane
released
from
cattle
manure
and
flatulence
is
more
dangerous
in
the
but
fades
fast
per
tonne
emitted
methane
has
a
much
larger
warming
impact
than
carbon
dioxide
however
it
only
remains
in
the
atmosphere
for
about
years
whereas
carbon
dioxide
persists
and
accumulates
for
millennia
said
study
raymond
pierrehumbert
a
physics
professor
at
the
university
of
oxford
as
a
result
the
researchers
found
over
a
period
production
of
cultured
meat
could
hike
global
warming
more
if
the
process
depended
heavily
on
energy
another
important
factor
was
land
use
they
said
for
example
clearing
forest
land
for
could
greatly
increase
the
carbon
footprint
of
beef
production
while
growing
meat
in
urban
laboratories
could
free
up
land
for
storing
carbon
in
vegetation
or
other
ways
a
separate
paper
from
think
tank
chatham
house
said
on
tuesday
cultured
meat
had
the
potential
to
contribute
to
the
goals
of
the
european
union
but
policy
makers
would
need
to
promote
clear
regulation
and
invest
public
funds
in
research
development
and
commercialisation
