s
oil
search
is
confident
its
partners
exxonmobil
corp
and
total
sa
will
be
ready
to
sign
off
on
two
big
projects
in
that
together
will
double
liquefied
natural

lng
exports
from
papua
new
guinea
oil
search
had
first
hoped
the
projects
to
fuel
an
expansion
of
exxon
mobil
s
png
lng
plant
would
be
approved
in
but
talks
with
the
government
took
longer
than
expected
after
an
earthquake
hit
the
country
a
year
ago
it
was
a
very
tough
year
in
papua
new
guinea
for
a
range
of
reasons
and
it
started
with
the
earthquake
oil
search
chief
executive
peter
botten
said
the
quake
killed
more
than
people
in
the
rugged
highlands
region
of
one
of
the
world
s
poorest
countries
destroyed
homes
roads
and
runways
and
knocked
out
gas
and
oil
facilities
it
also
stoked
antagonism
against
the
png
lng
project
as
the
country
s
take
from
the
development
has
been
much
lower
than
anticipated
and
the
government
has
been
slow
to
pay
out
royalties
to
local
communities
some
people
even
blamed
oil
and
gas
operations
for
triggering
the
quake
in
that
context
we
were
doing
a
lot
of
negotiations
on
major
projects
and
those
sensitivities
i
think
have
been
really
well
addressed
botten
told
reuters
after
the
company
reported
its
annual
results
total
is
set
to
sign
an
agreement
with
the
government
by
early
april
on
its
papua
lng
project
and
exxon
mobil
is
expected
to
follow
soon
after
on
terms
for
an
expansion
of
its

plant
and
development
of
a
new

new

from

lng
fields
and
p
nyang
are
set
to
feed
gas
into
three
new
processing
units
at
png
lng
roughly
doubling
its
output
to
million
tonnes
a
year
at
a
cost
of
around
billion
according
to
analysts
i
m
very
confident
that
a
final
investment
decision
is
very
achievable
botten
said
oil
search
which
has
a
percent
stake
in
the
png
lng
project
posted
a
percent
rise
in
annual
profit
boosted
by
higher
prices
for
its
lng
and
oil
which
offset
a
loss
of
output
after
the
earthquake
net
profit
for
the
year
ended
rose
to
million
from
million
a
year
earlier
but
fell
short
of
analysts
forecasts
around
million
according
to
refinitiv
data
oil
search
raised
its
full
year
dividend
to
cents
from
cents
in
oil
search
s
shares
fell
percent
in
a
slightly
firmer
broader
market
production
is
expected
to
return
to
levels
in
and
unit
production
costs
are
forecast
to
fall
percent
on
the
back
of
