environmentalists
urged
eu
policy
makers
on
tuesday
to
take
a
tougher
stance
on
air
pollution
from
coal
power
plants
in
the
western
balkans
blaming
the
fumes
for
deaths
across
europe
each
year
the
plants
with
gigawatts
gw
capacity
emitted
the
same
amount
of
sulfur
dioxide
in
as
plants
with
times
more
capacity
in
the
rest
of
the
european
union
five
environmentalist
groups
said
in
a
report
lignite
the
most
polluting
coal
is
widely
available
in
the
region
providing
a
cheap
energy
resource
and
the
major
source
of
energy
for
kosovo
serbia
bosnia
macedonia
and
montenegro
the
countries
are
members
of
the
energy
community
which
had
a
commitment
to
implement
eu
rules
to
curb
pollution
by
but
investments
in
new
power
plants
or
technology
to
cut
emissions
have
largely
been
delayed
the
report
said
air
pollution
knows
no
borders
and
is
still
an
invisible
killer
in
europe
said
vlatka
matkovic
puljic
senior
health
and
energy
officer
at
heal
and
the
report
s
lead
author
it
is
high
time
that
eu
step
up
efforts
to
clean
up
the
air
and
decarbonise
the
power
sector
she
said
the
report
said
the
west
balkan
power
plants
caused
pollution
across
the
eu
and
beyond
that
caused
healthcare
costs
of
up
to
billion
euros
billion
a
year
the
region
plans
to
add
gw
of
new
coal
plant
capacity
in
the
next
decade
mainly
financed
by
chinese
banks
the
report
said
adding
that
most
plants
would
not
meet
the
eu
s
pollution
control
rules
governments
in
the
region
say
they
need
to
expand
coal
power
generation
to
meet
rising
demand
and
ensure
energy
security
and
say
that
new
coal
plants
would
emit
less
greenhouse
gases
the
report
called
for
stricter
rules
to
be
imposed
on
the
energy
community
and
said
the
european
commission
should
make
meeting
those
regulations
a
requirement
for
joining
the
eu
for
now
the
countries
in
the
energy
community
do
not
face
any
penalties
if
targets
are
not
met
rather
than
investing
in
yet
more
outdated
coal
power
plants
western
balkan
leaders
need
to
increase
the
share
of
sustainable
forms
of
renewable
energy
