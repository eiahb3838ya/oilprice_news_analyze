by
alberta
s
rail
investment
is
part
of
a
rescue
package
for
an
oil
industry
struggling
with
high
costs
and
the
exit
of
some
foreign
majors
pipelines
have
become
congested
because
of
environmental
opposition
that
has
stymied
expansion
the
provincial
government
took
the
rare
step
in
january
of
ordering
oil
production
cuts
rather
than
produce
less
we
have
to
find
ways
to
move
more
notley
said
in
edmonton
the
plan
will
cost
alberta
c
billion
billion
consisting
of
buying
oil
leasing
cars
and
purchasing

alberta
expects
to
earn
gross

said
in
a
statement
the
alberta
government
said
in
november
when
canadian
oil
fetched
near
discounts
to
oil
that
it
was
seeking
train
capacity
it
has
also
provided
incentives
for
petrochemical
and
plants
canadian
volumes
hit
record
highs
last
year
but
declined
in
after
production
cuts
made
rail
shipments
less
economic
imperial
oil
said
it
was
forced
to
cut
its
own
rail
shipments
to
near
zero
illustrating
the
potential
for
unintended
consequences
when
governments
intervene
economic
conditions
were
already
improving
for
rail
shipments
notley
said
rail
shipments
are
seen
as
a
relief
valve
for
oil
when
pipelines
are
full
but
they
are
generally
more
expensive
and
less
safe
