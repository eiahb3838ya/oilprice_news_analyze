for

continued
their
downward
spiral
this
week
hitting
a

as
the

moved
further
away
from
the

the
sources
said
demand
in
china
remained
tepid
as
many
factories
there
were
still
shut
for
lunar
new

celebrations
trade
sources
said
the
lunar
new
year
fell
on
and
this
year
but
the
festival
typically
lasts
for
about
two
weeks
while

in

dipped

they
are
expected
to

weather
data
from

eikon
showed
it
snowed
in
beijing
but
it
s
not
that
cold
still
plus
the
factories
are
still
shut
so
the
inventory
levels
are
still
quite
high
a

said
several
unplanned

failed
to
lift

sources

loadings
of
lng
cargoes
at
malaysia
s
bintulu
export
plant
operated
by
petronas
were
delayed
this
week
due
to
lower
production
sources
have
said
but
the
delay
was
due
to
minor
glitches
at
the
plant
which
have
since
been
resolved
one
of
the
sources
said
woodside
petroleum
s
pluto
lng
facility
has
also
resumed
full
output
after
a
brief
outage
with
prices
falling
there
is
also
less
incentive
for
producers
to
keep
output
at
high
levels

source
said
natural
gas
flows
to
lng
export
terminals
were
expected
to
increase
in
coming
days
after
collapsing
to
their
lowest
level
in
almost
a
year
as
fog
clears
along
the
gulf
coast
analysts
said
the
drop
was
due
to
maintenance
work
at
the
lng
terminals
and
pipelines
feeding
them
and
fog
which
had
forced
several
vessels
to
drop
anchor
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
at
least
one
lng
cargo
was
delayed
briefly
from
cheniere
energy
inc
s
sabine
pass
terminal
in
louisiana
but
loadings
have
since
resumed
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
supply
remained
ample
in
asia
with
indonesia
s
lng
export
plant
offering
a

for
april
while
kuwait
petroleum
corp
was
seeking
a

indonesia

it
