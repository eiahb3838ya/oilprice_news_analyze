'phantom volcanoes' may hide more oil and gas in the north sea - study

an
unexplored
square
kilometre
square
mile
swathe
of
the
british
north
sea
previously
thought
to
contain
empty
chambers
left
by
three
extinct
volcanoes
may
hide
oil
and
gas
instead
the
university
of
aberdeen
said
on
tuesday
for
decades
it
was
assumed
that
the
rattray
volcanic
province
off
northwest
scotland
contained
old
magma
chambers
ruling
out
the
possibility
of
oil
and
gas
discoveries
however
the
university
s
geologists
now
say
these
phantom
volcanoes
never
existed
at
all
the
study
s
findings
raise
the
prospect
of
future
discoveries
in
the
area
which
has
been
left
untouched
over
years
of
exploration
activity
in
the
north
sea
said
the
university
what
we
found
has
completely
overturned
decades
of
accepted
knowledge
aberdeen
university
s
dr
nick
schofield
said
in
a
statement
this
gives
us
back
a
huge
amount
of
gross
rock
volume
that
we
never
knew
existed
in
one
of
the
world
s
most
prolific
regions
for
oil
and
gas
schofield
said
the
team
of
geologists
including
two
colleagues
from
university
and
the
university
of
adelaide
had
reassessed
the
area
by
combining
seismic
data
from
norway
s
petroleum
with
well
data
there
is
a
huge
area
under
there
that
hasn
t
been
looked
at
in
detail
for
a
long
time
because
of
the
previously
incorrect
geological
model
schofield
said
exploration
in
the
area
may
be
challenging
said
the
geologists
but
technology
is
improving
and
there
are
still
big
discoveries
being
made
in
the
north
sea
such
as
the
ones
in
the
central
graben
and
viking
graben
areas
as
the
old
saying
goes
often
the
best
places
to
look
for
oil
are
in
places
near
to
where
you
ve
already
found
it
said
schofield
the
north
sea
is
a
prime
example
of
the
volcanoes
were
thought
to
have
been
formed
millions
of
years
ago
during
seismic
activity
under
the
north
sea
that
almost
created
an
ocean
between
britain
and
europe
an
episode
geologists
have
described
as
a
failed
jurassic
