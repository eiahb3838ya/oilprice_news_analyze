column-slowing u.s. economy can ill afford any more shocks: kemp

the
economy
lost
a
lot
of
momentum
during
the
fourth
quarter
and
suffered
a
serious
wobble
in
december
which
should
give
policymakers
pause
before
doing
anything
that
could
unsettle
fragile
sentiment
further
freight
movements
by
road
rail
air
barge
and
pipeline
fell
more
than
percent
in
december
compared
with
november
according
to
the
bureau
of
transportation
statistics
bts
freight
shrank
by
the
most
in
any
one
month
since
march
and
was
just
percent
higher
than
in
the
same
month
a
year
earlier
the
weakest
performance
for
more
than
two
years
road
freight
slumped
more
than
percent

final

bts
truck
freight
has
been
losing
momentum
since
the
middle
of
last
year
but
the
drop
in
december
was
the
worst
for
nearly
seven
years
chartbook
separately
loaded
container
movements
through
the
major
gateways
of
los
angeles
and
long
beach
slowed
sharply
according
to
container
counts
from
the
port
operators
faltering
freight
volumes
are
consistent
with
other
data
showing
the
manufacturing
sector
hit
a
soft
patch
towards
the
end
of
last
year
manufacturing
output
hit
a
cycle
high
in
october
but
fell
in
each
of
the
three
following
months
and
was
down
more
than
percent
by
january
industrial
production
and
capacity
utilization
federal
reserve
purchasing
managers
also
reported
an
abrupt
deceleration
in
the
rate
of
expansion
with
the
institute
for
supply
management
s
composite
business
activity
index
registering
its
worst
decline
in
december
since
the
financial
crisis
in
recent
months
some
observers
have
commented
on
the
apparent
disconnect
between
plunging
financial
markets
wobbling
business
surveys
and
solid
economic
data
in
retrospect
however
the
data
is
all
coherent
the
drop
in
equity
valuations
and
flattening
of
the
yield
curve
in
the
fourth
quarter
are
consistent
with
hard
economic
data
showing
a
rapid
cooling
in
the
economy
late
in
the
critical
question
is
whether
the
slide
in
freight
and
manufacturing
activity
near
the
end
of
last
year
turns
out
to
be
a
brief
soft
patch
or
heralds
a
more
sustained
period
of
weakness
even
a
recession
equity
prices
rallied
strongly
in
january
and
the
institute
for
supply
management
s
composite
activity
indicator
reversed
some
of
the
losses
the
month
before
both
of
which
suggest
the
economy
will
continue
to
expand
but
both
remain
well
below
their
highs
and
the
yield
curve
has
not
steepened
significantly
which
point
to
a
more
sustained
loss
of
momentum
and
an
elevated
risk
of
recession
taken
together
the
available
financial
and
real
economic
data
suggests
an
economy
poised
between
continued
growth
at
a
slower
rate
or
the
onset
of
a
recession
like
expansions
recessions
are
driven
by
mechanisms
which
amplify
the
effect
of
an
initial
disturbance
often
quite
a
small
one
so
the
next
few
months
will
be
critical
in
the
circumstances
the
economy
can
ill
afford
any
more
negative
shocks
and
that
includes
an
escalation
of
the
trade
battle

china
