off
a
high
on
tuesday
while
sweden
s
crown
was
savaged
by
a
slowdown
in
inflation
less
than
two
months
after
its
central
bank
had
dared
to
raise
interest
rates
for
the
first
time
in
seven
years
world
markets
were
struggling
to
stay
positive
after
a
slow
but
buoyant
start
to
the
week
and
with
the
talk
of
tariffs
in
europe
also
coming
ahead
of
fresh
trade
talks
in
washington
later
wall
street
futures
were
pointing
around
percent
lower
after
europe
s
main
bourses
gave
up
an
early
fight
to
spend
the
day
in
the
red
after
asia
had
also
barely
got
out
of
first
gear
overnight
bank
shares
had
been
hit
by
a
mix
of
weak
results
from
the
region
s
biggest
and
most
global
institution
hsbc
and
by
some
weak
euro
zone
data
that
also
painted
gloomy
pictures
for
germany
and
italy
s
economies
currency
dealers
had
plenty
to
keep
them
busy
too
the
yen
had
slipped
to
per
dollar
after
japan
s
central
bank
governor
had
said
it
could
redeploy
stimulus
if
the
yen
s
relative
strength
this
year
hurt
the
economy
and
inflation
prospects
the
euro
was
slipped
back
under
after
more
talk
of
ecb
bank
loans
while
sweden
s
crown
dived
to
a
low
against
the
dollar
as
inflation
data
came
in
decidedly

richard

you
had
especially
weak
inflation
and
as
you
see
from
the
yen
and
euro
it
comes
against
this
backdrop
of
central
banks
becoming
more
dovish
again
although
he
also
said
that
bond
markets
has
seen
far
less
reaction
to
the
swedish
data
most
other
currencies
were
in
familiar
ranges

high

this

partly
on
expectations
the

could
ease

to
temper

on

ended
in

hsbc

slump
had
come
as
it
warned
of
slowing
growth
in
its
two
home

of
china

too
the
results
spoke
to
a
wider
problem
for
european
banks
which
are
struggling
to
return
to
growth
after
a
decade
of
restructuring
due
to
a
worsening
global

also
dominating

again

on

later
in

in

have
kindled
hopes
among
investors
that
the
two
countries
can
reach
a
compromise
in
their
trade
war
by
a
march
deadline
although
few
details
from
the
talks
have
emerged
president
donald
trump
said
last
week
he
might
extend
the
deadline

would
stop

immediate
increase
