chinese
coal
traders
have
stopped
ordering
australian
coal
as
clearing
times
through
china
s
customs
have
doubled
to
at
least
days
according
to
major
buyers
in
china
and
international
coal
merchants
resulting
in
a
sharp
fall
in
australian
prices
the
traders
and
a
broker
said
only
cargoes
from
australia
the
biggest
supplier
of
the
fuel
to
the
world
s
top
consumer
were
affected
we
have
stopped
ordering
coal
from
australia
because
it
is
unknown
how
long
the
restriction
will
last
said
a
manager
at
a
trading
company
who
usually
buys
around
tonnes
of
australian
coal
every
month
customs
clearance
typically
takes
five
to
days
now
it
can
be
as
much
as
days
said
the
manager
asking
not
to
be
identified
as
he
was
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
media
the
world
s
biggest
coking
coal
exporter
bhp
group
played
down
any
suggestion
the
customs
delays
had
any
connection
to
recent
diplomatic
tensions
i
don
t
believe
for
one
moment
this
is
linked
to
some
of
the
higher
level
issues
of
relationships
between
china
and
the
rest
of
the
world
bhp
chief
executive
andrew
mackenzie
said
speaking
during
a
conference
call
he
said
the
delays
were
not
targeted
against
australia
and
reflected
china
s
effort
to
balance
domestic
production
versus
imports
international
traders
confirmed
the
delays
yes
the
chinese
ports
are
holding
up
all
thermal
shipments
ex
australia
for
days
my
clients
are
only
buying
spot
indonesian
coal
said
an
australian
coal
trader
who
asked
not
to
be
named
due
to
company
policy
a
coal
broker
at
china
s
mining
group
minmetals
said
he
had
asked
clients
to
put
australian
imports
on
hold
the
delays
have
been
a
large
contributor
to
slump
in
australian
coal
prices
spot
cargo
prices
for
thermal
coal
exports
from
australia
s
newcastle
terminal
have
fallen
by
more
than
a
quarter
from
their
peaks
to
below
per
barrel
amid
ample
supply
and
tepid
demand
especially
from
china
it
was
not
clear
why
china
had
stepped
up
checks
on
australian
imports
but
tension
between
beijing
and
canberra
has
grown
in
recent
months
over
issues
of
cyber
security
and
china
s
influence
in
pacific
island
nations
china
s
general
administration
of
customs
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
there
was
no
immediate
response
from
the
foreign
ministry
to
a
faxed
request
for
comment
authorities
at
some
ports
notified
importers
verbally
this
month
that
australian
thermal
coal
but
also
coking
coal
would
take
longer
than
usual
to
clear
the
manager
said
a
coal
trader
and
a
purchasing
manager
at
a
coke
plant
received
similar
notifications
none
of
the
buyers
were
aware
of
the
reason
australian
newcastle
coal
price
china
has
curbed
coal
imports
in
the
past
to
support
domestic
coal
miners
and
reduce
consumption
to
tackle
air
pollution
it
restricted
indonesian
coal
imports
in
citing
high
impurities
and
low
energy
efficiency
this
time
round
the
restrictions
seem
targeted
at
australia
chinese
demand
for
indonesian
coal
remains
strong
said
a
merchant
specializing
in
supply
from
the
southeast
asian
country

reported
in
january
that
dozens
of
ships
carrying
coal
and
