european
and
asian
shares
hovered
near
highs
on
tuesday
as
investors
took
heart
from
some
progress
in
trade
talks
while
the
yen
dribbled
lower
as
japan
s
central
bank
said
it
could
ease
policy
again
world
markets
were
struggling
a
bit
for
direction
after
a
slow
but
buoyant
start
to
the
week
and
with
a
fresh
round
of
trade
talks
this
time
in
washington
being
held

happy

europe
s
main
bourses
spent
most
of
their
first
hour
dithering
before
eventually
heading

after
a
subdued
asian

seen
most
markets
there
barely
get
out
of
first

currency
dealers
had
at
least
a
bit
more
to
keep
them
busy
the
yen
had
slipped
to
per
dollar
after
japan
s
central
bank
governor
had
said
it
could
redeploy
stimulus
if
the
yen
s
relative
strength
this
year
hurt
the
economy
and
inflation
prospects
the
euro
was
just
above
after
more
talk
of
ecb

loans
while
sweden
s
crown
dived
to
a
low
against
the

said
td
securities
head
of
global
research
richard
kelly
you
had
especially
weak
inflation
and
as
you
see
from
the
yen
and
euro
it
comes
against
this
backdrop
of
central
banks
becoming
more
dovish
again
although
he
also
said
that
bond
markets
has
seen
far
less
reaction
to
the
swedish
data
most
other
currencies
were
stuck
in
familiar
ranges

was
flat
at
with
the
ongoing

while
the

that
was
not
far
from

was
the
highest
since
crude

added

to

for
the

and
the

were
a
shade
weaker

of
a
busy
day
of

australian

climbed
percent
to
a
month
peak
after
gaining
over
percent
so
far
this
year
partly
on
expectations
the
central
bank
could
ease
policy
to
temper
pressure
on
growth
chinese
shares
slipped
into
the
red
though
after
surging
in
the
previous
session
with
the
index
off
percent
hsbc
europe
s
biggest
bank
saw
its
shares
fall
percent
as
it
missed
forecasts
due
to
slowing
growth
in
its
two
home
markets
of
china
and
britain
the
results
spoke
to
a
wider
problem
for
european
banks
which
are
struggling
to
return
to
growth
after
a
decade
of
restructuring
due
to
a
worsening
global
economic
outlook
trade
talks
were
also
dominating
headlines
again
with
a
new
round
of
negotiations
between
the
united
states
and
china
expected
in
washington
on
tuesday
and
sessions
at
a
higher
level
later
in
the
week
reports
of
progress
in
the
talks
have
kindled
hopes
among
investors
that
the
two
countries
can
reach
a
compromise
in
their
trade
war
by
a
march
deadline
although
few
details
from
the
talks
have
emerged
president
donald
trump
said
last
week
he
might
extend
the
march
deadline
which
would
stop
an
immediate
increase
in
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
to
percent
from
percent
reflecting
changing
sentiment
chinese
shares
have
risen
rapidly
so
far
this
month
with
msci
s
china
a
shares
index
up
percent
by
far
the
best
performance
among
major
markets
despite
china
s
weakening
economy
additionally
investors
are
now
seen
returning
to
riskier
asset
markets
after
the
federal
reserve
signalled
earlier
this
year
it
could
halt
rate
hikes
in
light
of
economic
softness
in
the
last
week
it
seems
like
global
central
banks
have
started
a
possible
process
of
monetary
easing
