british start-up breeds high performance bugs for animal feed
london
reuters
after
centuries
of
selective
breeding
of
animals
and
plants
to
maximize
yields
in
agriculture
bugs
are
getting
the
same
treatment
as
demand
for
insect
protein
grows
british
beta
bugs
is
breeding
high
performance
strains
of
black
soldier
fly
for
the
insect
feed
sector
and
is
selecting
traits
like
growth
rate
protein
content
fat
composition
and
even
temperature
tolerance
according
to
clients
needs
most
animal
feed
is
made
from
soy
which
is
blamed
by
some
for
deforestation
as
farmers
try
to
meet
increasing
global
demand
for
the
crop
this
has
led
to
the
search
for
more
sustainable
sources
of
protein
there
are
insect
farms
around
europe
around
the
uk
even
elsewhere
in
the
world
which
are
using
food
waste
and
waste
streams
to
rear
insects
such
as
the
black
soldier
fly
which
they
can
then
feed
to
fish
chickens
and
we
re
looking
at
it
from
the
genetic
side
how
do
we
make
the
best
fly
and
the
best
bug
possible
for
use
in
these
farms
founder
and
managing
director
of
beta
bugs
thomas
farrugia
told
reuters
the
company
breeds
certain
strains
of
fly
resulting
in
highly
optimized
insects
the
feed
is
made
from
fly
maggots
you
can
cram
decades
worth
of
genetic
progress
that
has
been
made
in
every
other
animal
into
a
few
years
for
insects
said
farrugia
beta
bugs
says
it
wants
to
stimulate
the
growth
of
a
new
and
environmentally
beneficial
industry
by
bringing
real
benefits
directly
to
farms
