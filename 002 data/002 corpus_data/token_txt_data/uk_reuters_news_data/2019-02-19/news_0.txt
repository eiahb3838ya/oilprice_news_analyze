peru
on
tuesday
launched
a
new
sustained
effort
to
uproot
illegal
gold
mining
in
one
of
the
amazon
s
most
biodiverse
corners
sending
police
and
military
officers
to
the
region
after
deforestation
from
wildcat
mining
hit
a
new
high
last
year
the
government
of
president
martin
vizcarra
said
it
was
suspending
civil
liberties
and
tasking
the
armed
forces
with
restoring
the
rule
of
law
in
districts
rife
with
illegal
mining
in
madre
de
dios
or
mother
of
god
a
rainforest
region
known
for
its
high
biodiversity
forests
and
indigenous
tribes
that
shun
contact
with
outsiders
the
state
of
emergency
will
be
in
place
for
days
the
defense
ministry
added
in
a
statement
if
successful
the
operation
would
mark
the
first
time
peru
has
been
able
to
stop
an
illegal
industry
responsible
for
releasing
tonnes
of
mercury
into
the
environment
as
well
as
supporting
sex
trafficking
and
child
labor
in
mining
camps
the
crackdown
might
also
impact
the
production
and
shipment
of
gold
from
peru
the
world
s
producer
as
illegal
ore
often
makes
its
way
into
the
legal
supply
chain
through
middlemen
and
shell
companies
previous
in
madre
de
dios
have
spawned
contraband
smuggling
into
bolivia
high
gold
prices
during
the
global
financial
crisis
fueled
an
illegal
gold
rush
in
madre
de
dios
that
has
continued
to
expand
it
s
been
growing
for
better
part
of
a
decade
said
luis
fernandez
a
wake
forest
university
ecologist
who
has
been
studying
the
issue
since
in
every
town
there
are
little
shops
that
buy
gold
from
miners
that
emit
levels
of
mercury
from
power
plants
fernandez
said
we
re
just
starting
to
learn
what
the
impacts
will
be
on
the
wildcat
miners
in
madre
de
dios
are
often
tipped
off
about
government
plans
to
destroy
illegal
mining
camps
in
the
jungle
allowing
them
to
hide
expensive
machinery
and
flee
they
then
regroup
once
security
forces
leave
the
region
environmentalists
say
criminal
groups
that
finance
the
mining
are
now
better
organized
and
more
violent
than
ever
in
deforestation
from
wildcat
mining
in
southern
peru
where
madre
de
dios
is
located
peaked
at
hectares
acres
topping
the
previous
high
of
hectares
in
according
to
a
january
report
by
monitoring
of
the
andean
amazon
project
maap
which
uses
satellite
images
to
track
deforestation
for
the
ngo
amazon
conservation
the
defense
ministry
said
the
current
operation
which
it
dubbed
mercury
will
be
an
unprecedented
and
sustained
crackdown
on
illegal
mining
three
temporary
military
bases
with
military
officers
in
each
are
being
set
up
in
the
region
to
oversee
efforts
