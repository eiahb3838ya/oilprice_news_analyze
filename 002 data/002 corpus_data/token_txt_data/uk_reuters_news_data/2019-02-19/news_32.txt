bp
plans
to
ramp
up
production
at
azerbaijan
s
shah
deniz
gas
field
and
keep
output
flat
at
the
acg
oilfields
this
year
a
senior
regional
official
at
the
british
oil
major
said
a
consortium
said
last
week
that
it
produced
on
average
barrels
per
day
of
oil
at
acg
last
year
a
total
of
million
tonnes
almost
unchanged
from
volumes
natural
gas
production
from
the
shah
deniz
offshore
field
was
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
and
condensate
output
came
to
million
tonnes
up
from
bcm
of
gas
and
million
tonnes
of
condensate
in
we
expect
flat
oil
production
from
acg
and
a
rise
in
gas
production
at
shah
deniz
in
as
we
will
continue
to
ramp
up
production
on
shah
deniz
throughout
this
year
and
in
the
next
few
years
bakhtiyar
aslanbayli
bp
s
vice
president
for
azerbaijan
georgia
and
turkey
told
reuters
he
said
the
giant
acg
oilfields
which
have
so
far
produced
billion
barrels
of
oil
had
the
potential
to
yield
another
billion
barrels
bp
and
azerbaijan
in
extended
to
their
agreement
to
develop
the
acg
fields
a
deal
dubbed
by
the
azeri
government
as
the
contract
of
the
century
when
first
signed
in
the
arrangement
was
initially
due
to
run
until
aslanbayli
said
a
final
investment
decision
regarding
exploration
and
production
on
the
east
and
central
azeri
field
envisaged
by
the
extended
contract
would
be
made
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
aslanbayli
said
the
consortium
planned
two
maintenance
shutdowns
of
platforms
at
the
central
azeri
and
west
chirag
oilfields
this
year
for
a
couple
of
weeks
each
but
both
events
were
envisaged
in
production
forecasts
he
said
the
first
gas
from
the
second
stage
of
azerbaijan
s
giant
shah
deniz
field
would
be
delivered
to
markets
in
europe
on
time
in
we
are
quite
confident
that
we
will
be
able
to
deliver
gas
from
shah
deniz
ii
to
europe
next
year
as
it
was
planned
he
said
the
shah
deniz
i
field
has
been
pumping
gas
since
while
output
from
shah
deniz
ii
is
expected
to
reach
bcm
of
natural
gas
per
year
with
bcm
earmarked
for
europe
and
bcm
for
turkey
aslanbayli
said
the
capacity
of
pipelines
along
the
southern
gas
corridor
running
from
azerbaijan
to
europe
could
be
expanded
if
and
when
additional
volumes
of
gas
become
available
that
could
be
new
sources
of
supply
from
azerbaijan
from
other
fields
he
said
he
called
the
gas
field
promising
and
said
bp
planned
to
drill
the
first
exploration
well
there
this
year
if
everything
is
as
promising
as
we
expect
the
will
actually
have
huge
gas
resources
which
could
be
definitely
comparable
to
shah
deniz
he
said
he
added
that
the
company
would
drill
two
exploration
wells
in
shallow
waters
off
the
absheron
peninsula
and
conduct
testing
exploration
drilling
on
the
gobustan
onshore
oilfield
later
this
year
