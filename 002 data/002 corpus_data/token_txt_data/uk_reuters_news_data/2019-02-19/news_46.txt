northern
europe
will
experience
above
normal
temperatures
for
the
better
part
of
march
to
may
with
most
of
the
continent
enjoying
a
generally
warm
and
wet
spring
the
weather
company
said
on
tuesday
as
we
look
ahead
to
spring
we
feel
that
the
biggest
risks
for
colder
weather
relative
to
normal
are
still
in
march
and
especially
across
sections
said
todd
crawford
chief
meteorologist
at
the
weather
company
beyond
march
most
of
our
model
outputs
suggest
a
generally
spring
in
most
locations
especially
across
the
northern
half
of
europe
as
mobile
westerlies
impinge
upon
the
continent
he
said
scandinavia
will
experience
the
warmest
spring
added
the
weather
company
the
only
regions
that
will
see
colder
than
normal
weather
in
the
period
are
the
eastern
nordic
region
in
march
the
mainland
in
april
and
the
western
mainland
in
may
