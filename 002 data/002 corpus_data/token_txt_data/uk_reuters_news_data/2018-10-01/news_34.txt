asia
s
emerging
markets
the
key
driver
for
global
oil
demand
growth
are
being
hit
hard
by
soaring
crude
prices
and
sliding
currencies
raising
red
flags
over
expectations
of
further
increases
in
consumption
economies
are
already
aching
under
oil
prices
that
have
risen
above
per
barrel
this
week
the
most
since
late
analysts
warn
the
inflationary
combination
of
higher
oil
costs
and
weakening
currencies
including
india
s
rupee
indonesia
s
rupiah
and
the
philippine
peso
could
cause
a
global
economic
slowdown
that
would
also
crimp
oil
demand
in
those
countries
the
rumblings
of
falling
demand
undermines
the
current
market
narrative
that
projects
rising
crude
prices
in
some
cases
to
a
barrel
amid
the
loss
of
iranian
supply
as
the
united
states
is
set
impose
new
sanctions
on
the
country
on
the
currency
exchange
for
those
emerging
economies
is
leading
to
expensive
prices
at
the
pump
we
expect
this
will
lead
to
lower
demand
growth
in
the
region

keisuke
sadamori

of
energy
markets
and
security
at
the
international
energy
agency

this

edward
morse
the
global
head
of
commodities
at

said
the
emerging
market
woes
could
shave
barrels

off
oil

in
the
iea
currently
expects
global
oil
demand
growth
for
and
at
million
bpd
and
million
bpd
respectively
at
per
barrel
asia
s
oil
import
bill
would
breach
trillion
a
year
and
few
traders
or
analysts
expect
crude
prices
to
ease
for
the
lower
income
countries
of
emerging
asia
fuel
prices
are
too
expensive
at
those
levels
we
have
already
heard
anecdotes
from
around
the
world
that
customers
try
to
economise
at
the
pump
by
downgrading
their
fuel
consumption
from
high
quality
fuel
to
lower
quality
fuel
to
save
the
extra
few
bucks
said
janet
kong
chief
executive
of

supply
and
trading
eastern
hemisphere
at
bp
global
oil
consumption
is
set
to
increase
by
percent
in
according
to
the
iea
but
that
number
may
fall
as
asian
governments
and
consumers
try
to
cut
their
oil
costs
in
india
the
world
s
oil
importer
refiners
are
considering
the
risky
move
of
cutting
back
crude
imports
hoping
to
use
up
stocks
until
prices
fall
back
the
currency
s
plunge
has
meant
oil
prices
have
risen
nearly
percent
in
rupee
terms
this
year
indonesia
southeast
asia
s
biggest
country
and
economy
increased
its
subsidy
of
diesel
sold
in
fuel
stations
and
its
imports
of
lower
quality
gasoline
the
philippines
another
major
asian
emerging
economy
is
allowing
the
sale
of
lower
quality
fuels
to
consumers
to
combat
inflation
according
to
two
trade
sources
when
oil
prices
declined
in
many
governments
including
india
and
indonesia
increased
fuel
taxes
or
removed
subsidies
leading
to
record
high
retail
fuel
prices
as
crude
prices
rose
the
iea
s
sadamori
said
there
is
increasing
pressure
on
some
countries
to
fossil
fuel
subsidies
that
s
something
we
are
really
concerned
about
