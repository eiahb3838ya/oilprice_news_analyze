saudi
arabia
and
its
allies
can
not
or
will
not
replace
all
the

from

traders
foresee
a
shortage
of
seaborne
crudes
linked
to

as
sanctions
on

go
into

despite
reassurances
from
saudi

russia
and
the
united

supplies

remain
adequate
concern
about
feedstock
shortages
linked
to
sanctions
explains
why
has
been
overwhelmingly
concentrated
in
brent
rather
than
wti
or
refined
fuels
the
inland
crude
market
remains
and
refined
fuel
markets
appear
balanced
as
an
international
freight
slowdown
and
higher
prices
take
their
toll
on
consumption
but
brent
spot
prices
have
climbed
by
more
than
per
barrel
percent
since
while
the
calendar
spread
has
risen
almost
and
swung
from
contango
into
a
pronounced
backwardation
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
both
pledged
to
increase
production
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
crude
oil
exports
from
iran
officials
have
been
working
with
refiners
in
asia
to
find
replacements
or
iranian
oil
none
of
that
has
assuaged
fears
about
shortfalls
in
crude
availability
as
sanctions
go
into
effect
some
analysts
question
whether
saudi
arabia
has
enough
spare
capacity
to
replace
all
the
barrels
lost
as
a
result
of
sanctions
while
maintaining
enough
in
reserve
to
meet
any
further
shortfalls
others
question
whether
the
kingdom
is
willing
to
increase
production
enough
to
act
as
a
cap
on
prices
or
bring
them
back
down
below
despite
political
pressure
from
the
united
states
the
enormous
concentration
of
hedge
fund
long
positions
in
brent
creates
a
significant
risk
of
a
price
reversal
if
and
when
fund
managers
attempt
to
realise
some
of
their
profits
following
the
rally
for
the
time
being
however
with
doubts
swirling
around
the
outlook
for
oil

the
message
from
hedge

is
simple
