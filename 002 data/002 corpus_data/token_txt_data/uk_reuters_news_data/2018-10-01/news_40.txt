london
reuters
german
utility
rwe
is
still
comfortable
investing
in
britain
despite
the
possibility
of
a
hard
brexit
when
the
country
leaves
the
european
union
next
march
a
senior
executive
at
the
company
told
reuters
on
monday
rwe
generation
uk
is
the
country
s
electricity
generator
producing
more
than
percent
of
britain
s
power
it
operates
the
largest
fleet
of
power
plants
in
britain
along
with
some
coal
and
biomass
plants
and
employs
up
to
people
in
the
uk
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
on
march
yet
little
about
the
process
is
clear
there
is
so
far
no
full
exit
deal
rivals
to
prime
minister
theresa
may
are
circling
and
some
lawmakers
are
pushing
for
a
second
referendum
a
hard
brexit
is
not
good
for
companies
on
a
level
with
the
possibility
of
economic
downturn
tom
glover
chief
commercial
officer
at
rwe
generation
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
bloomberg
nef
future
of
energy
summit
there
is
operational
risk
from
a
hard
brexit
but
we
are
still
comfortable
investing
money
in
the
uk
he
said
adding
that
rwe
invests
around
million
pounds
million
a
year
in
britain
currently
the
company
would
like
more
detail
from
the
government
when
it
delivers
its
autumn
budget
statement
later
this
month
on
carbon
price
plans
after
brexit
glover
said
currently
britain
is
a
member
of
the
eu
s
emissions
trading
system
which
charges
the
eu
s
factories
and
power
plants
for
every
tonne
of
carbon
dioxide
they
emit
prices
of
eu
carbon
permits
have
rallied
to
around
euros
a
tonne
making
it
more
expensive
to
burn
fossil
fuels
however
it
is
not
clear
whether
britain
will
have
to
leave
the
eu
ets
due
to
brexit
and
whether
it
will
set
up
its
own
carbon
market
and
link
to
the
eu
one
in
march
this
year
german
utility
and
rival
rwe
announced
a
major
asset
swap
under
the
deal
rwe
s
networks
and
renewables
business
innogy
will
be
broken
up
and
its
assets
split
between
and
rwe
glover
said
rwe
will
get
wind
power
assets
from
innogy
and
becoming
the
second
biggest
offshore
wind
player
in
the
world
and
the
third
biggest
renewables
player
in
europe
rwe
is
still
working
on
its
renewables
strategy
which
will
commit
at
least
billion
euros
a
year
to
renewables
investment
exactly
how
and
where
that
will
be
deployed
will
be
detailed
in
the
strategy
next
year
probably
in
the
first
quarter
of
next
year
