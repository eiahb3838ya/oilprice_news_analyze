a
century

new
bmw
sedan
the
latest
in
a
line
of
cars
that
defined
the
concept
of
a
premium
sports
sedan
will
aim
to
reinvigorate
a
range
that
has
ceded
ground
to
suvs
and
electric
drives
while
the
mercedes
gle
marks
an
attempt
to
take
an
suv
to
a
new
level
with
some
autonomous
driving
features
and
the
peugeot
concept
stands
for
what
automakers
need
to
do
next
and
fast
design
electrified
vehicles
that
are
both
appealing
and
profitable
the
new
generation
bmw
sedan
will
immediately
fight
for
attention
with
a
different
car
bearing
the
designation
tesla
inc
s
electric
model
tesla

challenges
bmw
and
other
traditional
premium
brands
for
technological
leadership
with
software
that
can
be
constantly
upgraded
to
improve
the
car
s
performance
and
driver
experience
and
to
add
features
the
new
bmw
will
also
fight
for
attention
in
paris
as
in
the
marketplace
with
the
worldwide
shift
to
suvs
that
phenomenon
will
be
represented
by
the
new
generation
of
the
mercedes
gle
sport
utility
among
other
models
the
new
gle
which
goes
on
sale
next
year
will
come
with
a
new
electronic
suspension
system
that
can
vary
the
shock
absorbing
function
at
each
wheel
individually
inside
the
cabin
drivers
and
passengers
can
view
information
on
two
inch
screens
the
gle
also
takes
another
step
toward
automating
the
process
of
driving
with
a
system
that
can
steer
and
vary
the
speed
of
the
car
within
a
marked
lane
up
to
miles
per
hour
the
gle
can
effectively
pilot
itself
in
rush
hour
traffic
jams
mercedes
will
offer
in
the
gle
a
electrical
system
that
gives
the
vehicle
an
electric
boost
away
from
stops
that
offers
a
modest
reduction
in
fuel
consumption
at
a
time
when
regulators
worldwide
want
automakers
to
eliminate
their
internal
combustion
technology
and
go
the
gle
highlights
the
auto
industry
s
conflicted
response
to
the
regulatory
and
consumer
pressure
to
dump
diesel
technology
and
accelerate
the
shift
to
vehicles
suvs
such
as
the
mercedes
gle
generate
the
bulk
of
profits
for
global
automakers
tesla
gets
praise
for
its
innovation
but
is
scrambling
to
show
a
profit
in
the
third
quarter
after
a
tumultuous
year
the
challenge
for
established
automakers
is
to
design
electric
cars
compelling
enough
to
persuade
consumers
to
pay
a
profitable
premium

legacy
automakers
have
tended
to
produce
electric
cars
that
are
drab
small
or
strange
psa
group
s
peugeot
concept
aims
to
break
that
pattern
with
a
homage
to
the
peugeot
that
looks
like
it
could
have
starred
in
a
late
french
new
wave
movie
while
not
destined
for
production
the
does
reflect
a
dilemma
facing
automakers
like
psa
and
its
boss
carlos
tavares
over
how
to
reconcile
connected
autonomous
cars
with
more
traditional
product
traits
such
as
driving
pleasure
where
their
expertise
really
lies
while
the
peugeot
fantasy
car
is
it
can
also
be
driven
manually
or
flipped
into
a
sharp
autonomous
mode
that
accelerates
and
steers
more
aggressively
because
as
the
company
said
in
promoting
the
concept
boredom
is
not
