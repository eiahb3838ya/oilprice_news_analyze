graphic-boom, bust or both? the challenge of predicting 2019's oil market balance
london
reuters
in
the
oil
market
balance
is
a
difficult
game
calculating
whether
the
million
barrel
per
day
world
market
is
likely
in
the
months
ahead
to
have
a
surplus
or
deficit
of
supply
or
be
balanced
where
supply
equals
demand
is
never
simple
projections
must
take
into
account
a
host
of
factors
from
world
economic
growth
refinery
operations
and
changing
fuel
use
patterns
on
the
demand
side
to
investment
patterns
rates
of
mature
oilfield
decline
weather
politics
war
and
opec
on
the
supply
side
working
out
what
the
oil
balance
will
look
like
next
year
is
proving
particularly
difficult
the
oil
market
is
basically
hardly
ever
in
balance
said
strategist
bjarne
schieldrop
of
swedish
bank
seb
it
is
either
too
much
or
too
little
it
is
very
hard
to
balance
it
just
right
that
means
that
the
oil
market
naturally
will
move
between
the
two
extremes
of
low
price
demand
boost
and
supply
destruction
or
high
price
supply
boost
and
demand
and
since
the
middle
ground
between
these
two
seems
to
be
the
range
where
it
is
neither
of
the
at
a
barrel
crude
now
is
at
its
highest
for
four
years
and
some
big
trading
houses
now
think
crude
is
likely
a
price
which
may
trigger
some
rationing
of
demand
an
increase
in
the
value
of
the
dollar
in
line
with
rising
interest
rates
has
made
oil
more
costly
for
emerging
market
fuel
buyers
including
india
china
and
indonesia
which
may
curb
their
imports
even
so
an
average
of
the
three
main
public
agencies
that
project
world
oil
demand
growth
the
international
energy
agency
the
energy
administration
and
opec
is
signalling
another
year
of
oil
demand
growth
next
year
the
average
of
the
three
agencies
forecasts
is
growth
of
million
bpd
in
and
million
bpd
in
reaching
million
bpd
on
average
next
year
the
three
on
average
expect
crude
supply
they
do
not
even
try
to
predict
what
opec
will
do
to
outstrip
global
demand
next
year
by
bpd
similar
to
this
year
leaving
opec
to
supply
the
difference
if
it
chooses
to
graphic
balancing
crude
oil
supply
in
on
the
supply
side
iran
is
the
big
unknown
predictions
for
how
much
of
iran
s
million
bpd
of
exports
will
be
lost
to
sanctions
range
from
half
a
million
bpd
to
million
bpd
or
most
of
it
s
exports
there
are
two
quick
sources
of
extra
output
the
tapping
of
spare
capacity
held
largely
by
opec
leader
saudi
arabia
or
from
those
producers
that
can
respond
rapidly
to
higher
prices
namely
the
shale
industry
in
the
united
states
two
consultancies
are
taking
a
very
different
view
of
the
balance
next
year
than
the
three
main
agencies
rapidan
group
expects
a
supply
surplus
of
more
than
one
million
bpd
triggered
by
an
aggressive
shale
supply
response
to
high
prices
and
a
hit
on
emerging
market
demand
we
forecast
well
over
million
bpd
in
global
surpluses
next
year
even
that
may
be
too
small
as
emerging
market
currency
collapses
may
harken
a
big
emerging
market
growth
slowdown
next
year
said
rapidan
group
president
bob
mcnally
barring
big
geopolitical
disruptions
we
re
hearing
an
echo
of
and
when
a
tidal
wave
of
prospective
supply
growth
compelled
opec
and
russia
to
either
surrender
market
share
with
large
proactive
cuts
or
accept
big
price
rapidan
expects
crude
supply
alone
to
grow
faster
than
total
global
consumption
graphic
rapidan
forecast
for
implied
global
oil
supply
balance
in
at
the
other
extreme
energy
aspects
is
projecting
a
shortfall
in
supply
of
bpd
with
demand
curtailed
by
the
impact
of
trade
tariffs
first
though
energy
aspects
is
calling
for
the
final
quarter
of
to
have
the
tightest
balance
in
over
a
decade
in
a
note
titled
empty
the
consultancy
said
a
combination
of
the
steep
decline
in
iranian
exports
a
lack
of
any
spare
capacity
and
the
resurgence
of
chinese
teapot
refinery
buying
would
cause
an
unusually
tight
balance
that
trading
houses
such
as
mercuria
and
trafigura
think
may
be
enough
to
drive
oil
prices
to
a
barrel
perhaps
in
turn
sowing
the
seeds
of
demand
destruction
so
boom
then
bust
the
history
of
oil
price
cycles
indicates
that
is
not
impossible
