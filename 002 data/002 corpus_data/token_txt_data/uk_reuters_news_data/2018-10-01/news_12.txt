pavel
sorokin
said
in
an
interview
he
also

the

had
no
immediate
plan

oil
exports
in

an
increase
in

fuel
prices
russia
is
pinning
its
hopes
on
oil
hidden
beneath
rocks
as
conventional
oil
reserves
in
west
siberia
its
main
region
are
becoming
increasingly
depleted
as
part
of
western
sanctions
over
the
conflict
in
ukraine
the
united
states
imposed
restrictions
on
providing
russia
with
technology
for
oil
also
known
as
shale
oil
but
despite
the
sanctions
oil
production
including
crude
is
growing
many
of
our
companies
have
advanced
in
this
direction
sorokin
said
of
russian
producers
ability
to
extract
such
oil
we
expect
that
the
production
of
oil
will
rise
from
million
tonnes
in
to
million
tonnes
by
the
end
of
he
said
russia
s
oilfield
licenses
regulator
rosnedra
has
put
the
country
s
oil
reserves
at
around
billion
tonnes
or
billion
barrels
of
all
russian
oil
reserves
and
enough
to
supply
the
world
with
oil
for
years
the
state
has
introduced
tax
incentives
for
oil
production
including
a
mineral
extraction
tax
overall
oil
production
in
russia
is
seen
at
million
tonnes
this
year
up
from
million
tonnes
last
year
sorokin
who
with
energy
minister
alexander
novak
has
been
heading
russia
s
efforts
to
forge
closer
ties
with
oil
producer
group
opec
said
moscow
had
no
immediate
plan
to
restrict
oil
exports
in
order
to
dampen
domestic
fuel
prices
it
is
more
profitable
for
companies
to
sell
fuel
abroad
than
on
the
domestic
market
for
several
reasons
including
the
weakening
of
the
rouble
we
re
not
talking
about
physical
restrictions
at
the

deputy
minister
