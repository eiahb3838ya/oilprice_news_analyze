fuel
oil
hsfo
essentially
the
leftovers
of
an
oil
refiner
s
output
will
still
flow
from
refineries
around
the
world
even
after
new
rules
start
up
in
curtailing
its
use
in
the
global
shipping
fleet
a
reuters
survey
showed
sixty
percent
of
the
refineries
contacted
by
reuters
in
a
global
survey
will
still
produce
hsfo
in
although
the
supply
will
tighten
as
percent
of
these
refiners
plan
to
reduce
their
output
starting
that
year
ships
will
have
to
use
marine
fuel
which
primarily
consists
of
residual
fuel
oil
with
a
maximum
sulphur
content
of
percent
under
international
maritime
organization
imo
rules
to
reduce
air
pollution
currently
the
global
shipping
fleet
which
includes
oil
and
chemical
tankers
as
well
as
container
ships
uses
as
much
as
million
barrels
per
day
of
hsfo
with
a
maximum
of
percent
sulphur
refiners
will
have
little
incentive
to
produce
hsfo
after
the
regulations
though
some
demand
will
remain
as
a
small
but
growing
number
of
vessels
are
fitted
with
smokestack
scrubbers
that
remove
the
sulphur
from
the
exhaust
fumes
and
power
plants
will
continue
to
consume
the
fuel
although
hsfo
demand
for
ships
is
expected
to
decline
substantially
in
the
oil
s
demand
for
power
generation
and
general
users
will
remain
japan
s
refiner
idemitsu
kosan
told
reuters
in
the
survey
in
future
demand
for
ships
is
projected
to
recover
so
we
expect
hsfo
output
to
reuters
survey
of
refiners
on
imo
when
asked
how
they
plan
to
reduce
hsfo
output
just
over
half
of
the
refiners
said
they
will
upgrade
their
plants
to
further
process
their
fuel
oil
to
produce
more
higher
value
products
such
as
gasoline
and
diesel
of
the
refiners
who
responded
to
a
question
about
how
much
investment
they
plan
to
pump
into
their
plants
to
produce
more
and
fuel
oil
said
they
plan
to
spend
less
than
million
five
of
them
are
investing
between
million
and
more
than
billion
in
such
projects
polish
refiner
grupa
lotos
will
spend
more
than
million
to
convert
its
heavy
residue
to
middle
distillates
and
coke
by
the
end
of
while
kuwait
has
a
billion
clean
fuels
project
fuel
oil
or
residue
fuel
is
the
remaining
product
from
crude
oil
processed
through
crude
distillation
units
at
a
refinery
to
extract
more
value
from
residue
it
is
further
processed
at
secondary
refining
units
such
as
residue
fluid
catalytic
crackers
hydrocrackers
and
cokers
to
produce
gasoline
and
diesel
however
secondary
units
are
costly
and
require
years
to
build
while
expansion
projects
in
some
countries
have
to
overcome
tough
environment
regulations
we
will
need
the
environment
protection
agency
s
approval
if
we
want
to
expand
the
coker
and
that
is
tough
in
taiwan
now
formosa
petrochemical
corp
spokesman
ky
lin
said
formosa
has
adjusted
its
coker
unit
which
uses
heat
and
pressure
to
break
down
the
residue
fuel
into
other
products
to
run
at
percent
utilization
from
percent
to
reduce
its
hsfo
output
lin
said
refiners
will
want
to
cut
their
hsfo
output
as
much
as
possible
to
offset
the
expected
drop
in
value
by
january
hsfo
in
singapore
will
be
worth
a
barrel
less
than
middle
east
benchmark
dubai
crude
down
from
a
discount
of
for
october
according
to
swap
values
besides
upgrading
a
handful
of
refiners
said
they
would
also
process
more
lower
sulphur
crude
oil
to
reduce
the
sulphur
content
in
their
products
output
refiners
may
also
cut
their
overall
cdu
runs
to
reduce
their
residue
output
if
low
fuel
oil
margins
drag
down
overall
profits
according
to
the
survey
forward
prices
are
scary
formosa
s
lin
said
other
refiners
will
look
at
alternative
markets
for
their
hsfo
if
fuel
oil
demand
falls
we
will
switch
our
configuration
to
produce
bitumen
which
is
in
high
demand
in
india
due
to
its
programme
said
an
official
from
indian
oil
corp
some
refiners
prefer
to
stay
flexible
by
being
able
to
switch
their
output
between
and
fuel
oil
according
to
market
demand
india
s
bharat
petroleum
corp
ltd
said
it
will
be
able
to
produce
either
fuel
oil
or
switch
to
other
products
depending
on
demand
after
we
will
not
reduce
fuel
oil
output
to
zero
completely
as
we
need
our
refineries
to
be
flexible
a
bpcl
official
said
the
official
declined
to
be
named
as
they
are
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
media
italy
s
eni
said
it
will
produce
the
minimum
amount
of
hsfo
just
to
satisfy
the
market
demand
of
the
ships
that
will
have
installed
the
an
official
from
india
s
hindustan
petroleum
corp
ltd
said
the
company
will
be
producing
some
fuel
oil
but
the
output
will
be
very
very
low
beyond
a
third
of
the
respondents
said
they
are
either
already
not
producing
any
hsfo
or
will
stop
producing

it
will

a
spokeswoman
from

said
we
are
already
ready
to
face
and
we
already
produce
basically
no
canada
s
husky
energy
spokesman
mel
duvall
said
the
company
expects
to
benefit
from
the
new
imo
rule
since
it
will
boost
diesel
demand
it
is
expected
that
there
will
be
an
increase
in
global
demand
for
diesel
fuel
as
ship
operators
switch
from
