optimism
about
a
reconstituted
free
trade
agreement
among
the
united
states
canada
and
mexico
and
what
it
could
mean
for
trade
relations
elsewhere
helped
world
markets
kick
off
the
fourth
quarter
of
the
year
in
a
positive
vein
the
united
states
and
canada
salvaged
nafta
as
a
trilateral
pact
with
mexico
rescuing
a
trillion
zone
that
had
been
about
to
collapse
after
nearly
a
quarter
century
japan
s
nikkei
rose
percent
to
a
high
followed
by
gains
in
european
stocks
markets
with
italian
shares
in
particular
clawing
back
some
of
last
week
s
losses
and
stock
futures
indicating
a
sharply
higher
open
on
wall
street
the
canadian
dollar
was
up
percent
against
the
dollar
to
a
high
and
the
mexican
peso
hit
its
highest
in
over
seven
weeks
up
nearly
a
percent
on
the
day
the
trade
deal
is
helping
risk
appetite
across
the
board
especially
the
canadian
dollar
and
that
will
likely
lift
appetite
for
currencies
across
the
board
said
manuel
oliveri
a
currency
strategist
at
credit
agricole
in
london
a
index
of
shares
was
up
percent
led
by
italian
stocks
which
were
up
as
much
as
percent
on
the
day
bouncing
off
a
low
hit
last
week
on
friday
italian
stocks
bonds
and
the
euro
had
all
sold
off
on
worries
over
a
budget
proposal
from
italy
s
new
government
particularly
after
a
report
said
the
european
union
was
set
to
reject
the
plan
but
such
were
the
scale
of
the
losses
that
some
analysts
believed
the
market
had
gone
too
far
the
math
just
does
not
justify
the
price
action
we
saw
on
friday
not
even
close
unicredit
economist
erik
nielsen
wrote
in
a
note
on
sunday
it
wasn
t
unalloyed
optimism
on
italy
however
with
bonds
selling
off
with
and
yields
higher
basis
points
though
there
was
some
demand
for
debt
the
closely
watched
spread
between
italian
and
german
bond
yields
was
at
basis
points
about
bps
wider
than
this
time
last
week
but
comfortably
below
friday
s
high
of
bps
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
european
commission
will
not
like
the
budget
proposal
said
commerzbank
rates
strategist
michael
leister
brussels
will
give
its
opinion
which
we
think
won
t
be
positive
and
the
ratings
agencies
will
opt
for
a
similar
stance
a
downgrade
is
our
base
the
euro
was
also
intially
hit
by
worries
about
a
rise
in
italy
s
fiscal
deficit
dropping
below
the
mark
but
it
recovered
as
the
session
progressed
to
trade
slightly
higher
at
also
casting
a
shadow
on
markets
were
two
surveys
on
sunday
that
showed
growth
in
chinese
manufacturing
sputtered
in
september
as
domestic
and
export
demand
softened
as
a
result
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
fell
percent
china
s
financial
markets
were
closed
for
a
holiday
as
was
hong
kong
s
stock
exchange
the
escalation
of
trade
tensions
between
the
and
china
recently
has
likely
weighed
on
purchasing
managers
sentiment
as
reflected
by
softer
readings
in

merrill
lynch
said
in
a
note
oil
prices
strengthened
with
international

hitting

rose

the
highest
since

before
