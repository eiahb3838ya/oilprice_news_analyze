electric
cars
are
poised
to
arrive
en
masse
in
european
showrooms
after
years
of
hyped
launches
and
billions
in
investment
by
automakers
and
suppliers
now
comes
the
hard
part
selling
them
at
a
profit
battery
models
making
their
debut
in
paris
this
week
from
psa
group
s
electric
crossback
to
the
mercedes
eqc
will
erode
profitability
as
they
struggle
to
stay
in
the
black
executives
generally
acknowledge
but
concerns
are
mounting
that
the
impact
could
be
worse
as
consumers
resist
paying
more
for
electrified
vehicles
forcing
carmakers
to
sell
them
at
a
bigger
loss
to
meet
emissions
goals
what
everyone
needs
to
realise
is
that
clean
mobility
is
like
organic
food
it
s
more
expensive
said
carlos
tavares
chief
executive
of
peugeot
citroen
and
opel
manufacturer
psa
a
profit
warning
by
bmw
blamed
in
part
on
electrification
costs
and
tightening
emissions
rules
was
a
first
alarm
signal
tavares
said
in
a
weekend
radio
interview
either
we
accept
paying
more
for
clean
mobility
or
we
put
the
european
auto
industry
in
underlining
the
turbulence
facing
automakers
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
will
confront
conservative
rebels
demanding
a
harder
brexit
stance
at
her
party
s
annual
conference
just
as
the
paris
show
gets
underway
on
tuesday
on
its
second
day
the
european
parliament
votes
on
plans
to
cut
carbon
dioxide
car
emissions
by
as
much
as
percent
by
from
an
average
grammes
per
kilometre
in
a
goal
many
automakers
are
already
in
danger
of
missing
on
pain
of
fines
running
to
hundreds
of
millions
of
euros
after
declining
for
a
decade
carbon
emissions
are
rising
again
as
customers
flock
from
cars
to
suvs
and
from
diesel
to
gasoline
engines
diesels
emit
more
nitrogen
oxides
and
particulates
but
less
early
signs
suggest
prices
may
fall
sooner
and
faster
than
production
costs
as
carmakers
adjust
for
stalled
emissions
progress
and
weak
consumer
appetite
that
promises
more
red
ink
as
discounted
battery
car
sales
finally
take
off
volkswagen
has
said
the
id
hatchback
due
to
open
the
brand
s
electric
onslaught
next
year
will
be
priced
close
to
conventionally
powered
versions
of
the
golf
compact
vw
is
about
to
launch
a
load
of
electric
vehicles
at
the
same
price
as
gasolines
and
therefore
at
a
loss
said
laurent
petizon
a
managing
director
at
consulting
firm
alixpartners
our
interpretation
is
that
the
fines
have
already
been
factored
into
their
sales
strategy
he
said
rather
than
pay
penalties
they
prefer
to
lose
money
on
vehicles
and
get
the
market
volkswagen
declined
to
discuss
pricing
in
detail
we
want
our
electric
cars
to
be
a
real
alternative
to
a
reasonably
equipped
golf
diesel
a
spokesman
said
volkswagen
and
mercedes
parent
daimler
which
between
them
have
announced
billion
euros
billion
in
electrification
investment
both
warned
last
month
that
it
would
not
be
enough
they
and
other
carmakers
are
also
mandated
to
sell
more
electric
cars
in
china
and
a
group
of
states
led
by
california
more
than
electric
and
model
launches
are
already
scheduled
globally
over
the
next
three
years
electric
cars
still
cost
euros
more
to
produce
on
average
than
conventional
ones
alixpartners
calculates
hybrids
which
combine
a
smaller
rechargeable
battery
with
a
combustion
engine
overshoot
by
euros
when
that
cost
gap
is
reflected
in
the
price
few
are
sold
electrics
such
as
the
renault
zoe
and
nissan
leaf
have
been
on
sale
for
most
of
the
current
decade
and
heavily
subsidized
in
europe
while
tesla
has
made
inroads
into
the
premium
business
yet
cars
claim
just
percent
of
the
market
overall
despite
their
higher
cost
bmw
models
are
already
priced
broadly
on
a
par
with
diesels
the
luxury
carmaker
acknowledges
that
their
margins
are
significantly
thinner
mercedes
also
says
the
eqc
electric
suv
will
be
priced
close
to
its
glc
cousin
to
tackle
tesla
s
model
it
absolutely
is
impacting
the
profitability
of
the
industry
said
rebecca

at

blue

which

demand
doesn
t
justify
investment
at
all
it
s
all
which
is
why
on
this
subject
more
than
most
european
carmakers
talk
from
both
sides
of
their
mouths
while
executives
exude
confidence
for
investors

secretary
general
erik
jonnaert
said
recently
carmakers
are
demanding
increased
public
investment
in
recharging
networks
which
may
yet
awaken
mass
demand
economies
of
scale
should
also
bring
some
relief
but
batteries
which
claim
percent
of
an
electric
car
s
value
face
global
cobalt
and
nickel
shortages
that
will
pull
the
other
way
inflating
costs
as
production
volumes
rise
perhaps
more
critically
generous
government
sales
subsidies
are
unlikely
to
survive
much
growth
in
markets
where
incentives
have
been
dropped
electric
car
sales
have
fallen
renault

discounting
its
recently
upgraded
zoe

the
uk
market

programme
director
olivier
salvat
told
reporters
on
a
recent
factory
visit
adding
that
the
carmaker
aimed
to
avoid
losing
money
on
each
vehicle
sold
we
don
t
launch
vehicles
with
negative
operating
margins
salvat
said
german
luxury
carmakers
including
volkswagen
group
which
includes
audi
and
porsche
could
put
up
with
losses
on
electrified
vehicles
if
it
enables
them
to
keep
selling
their
biggest
earners
upscale
suvs
and
large
sedans
that
would
leave
competitors
such
as
psa
and
renault
which
can
ill
afford
to
sell
large
volumes
of
electric
cars
below
cost
in
a
tougher
bind
in
electromobility
you
have
to
be
