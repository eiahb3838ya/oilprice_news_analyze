optimism
about
a
reconstituted
free
trade
agreement
among
the
united
states
canada
and
mexico
and
what
it
could
mean
for
trade
relations
elsewhere
helped
world
markets
kick
off
the
fourth
quarter
of
the
year
in
a
positive
vein
worries
on
italian
politics
and
chinese
manufacturing
tempered
the
optimism
but
the
deal
to
save
nafta
was
enough
to
put
world
stocks
in
the
black
the
united
states
and
canada
salvaged
nafta
as
a
trilateral
pact
with
mexico
rescuing
a
trillion
zone
that
had
been
about
to
collapse
after
nearly
a
quarter
century
japan
s
nikkei
rose
percent
to
a
high
and
european
stocks
were
up
overall
despite
losses
on
italian
markets
on
political
concerns
the
canadian
dollar
was
up
percent
against
the
dollar
to
a
high
and
the
mexican
peso
hit
its
highest
in
over
seven
weeks
the
trade
deal
is
helping
risk
appetite
across
the
board
especially
the
canadian
dollar
and
that
will
likely
lift
appetite
for
currencies
across
the
board
said
manuel
oliveri
a
currency
strategist
at
credit
agricole
in
london
a
index
of
shares
was
up
percent
though
gains
were
curbed
by
concern
over
how
the
italian
government
s
spending
plans
would
affect
relations
with
the
european
union
italian
bond
yields
extended
last
week
s
rise
and
stocks
fell
on
a
report
that
the
eu
is
set
to
reject
italy
s
budget
plans
in
november
and
open
a
procedure
against
the
country
s
public
accounts
the
closely
watched
spread
between
italian
and
german
bond
yields
was
at
basis
points
over
bps
wider
than
this
time
last
week
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
european
commission
will
not
like
the
budget
proposal
said
commerzbank
rates
strategist
michael
leister
brussels
will
give
its
opinion
which
we
think
won
t
be
positive
and
the
ratings
agencies
will
opt
for
a
similar
stance
a
downgrade
is
our
base
the
euro
was
also
hit
by
worries
about
a
rise
in
italy
s
fiscal
deficit
dropping
below
the
mark
having
lost
percent
last
week
and
off
high
of
touched
a
week
ago
also
casting
a
shadow
were
two
surveys
on
sunday
that
showed
growth
in
chinese
manufacturing
sputtered
in
september
as
domestic
and
export
demand
softened
as
a
result
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
fell
percent
china
s
financial
markets
were
closed
for
a
holiday
as
was
hong
kong
s
stock
exchange
the
escalation
of
trade
tensions
between
the
and
china
recently
has
likely
weighed
on
purchasing
managers
sentiment
as
reflected
by
softer
readings
in
economists
at
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
said
in
a
note
oil
prices
held
their
gains
with
international
benchmark
brent
briefly
hitting
a
high
as
sanctions
on
tehran
squeezed
iranian
crude
exports
tightening
supply
even
as
other
key
exporters
increased
production
brent
crude
futures
rose
percent
to
as
high
as

the
highest
since
