a

to

a

the

the
trade
deal
is
helping
risk
appetite
across
the
board
especially
the
canadian
dollar
and
that
will
likely
lift
appetite
for
currencies
across
the
board
said
manuel
oliveri
a
currency
strategist
at
credit
agricole
in
london
the
canadian
dollar
was
up
percent
against
the
dollar
at
a
high
and
the
mexican
peso
hit
its
highest
in
over
seven
weeks
up
nearly
a
percent
on
the
day
usmca
is
aimed
at
bringing
more
jobs
into
the
united
states
with
canada
and
mexico
accepting
more
restrictive
commerce
with
the
united
states
their
main
export
partner
it
also
effectively
maintains
the
current
auto
sector
and
largely
spares
canada
and
mexico
from
the
prospect
of
tariffs
on
their
vehicles
although
it
will
make
it
harder
for
global
auto
makers
to
build
cars
cheaply
in
mexico
shares
of
carmakers
rose
with

rising

hit
last
week
on
friday
italian
stocks
bonds
and
the
euro
had
all
sold
off
on
worries
over
a
budget
proposal
from
italy
s
new
government
particularly
after
a
report
said
the
european
union
was
set
to
reject
the
plan
but
such
were
the
scale
of
the
losses
that
some
analysts
believed
the
market
had
gone
too
far
the
math
just
does
not
justify
the
price
action
we
saw
on
friday
not
even
close
unicredit
economist
erik
nielsen
wrote
in
a
note
on
sunday
the
euro
was
also
initially
hit
by
worries
about
a
rise
in
italy
s
fiscal
deficit
dropping
below
the
mark
but
it
recovered
as
the
session
progressed
to
trade
slightly
higher
at
also
casting
a
shadow
on

two
surveys

brent
