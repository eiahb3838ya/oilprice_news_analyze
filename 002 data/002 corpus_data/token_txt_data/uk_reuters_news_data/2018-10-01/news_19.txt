opec oil output boost in september limited by iran losses - reuters survey
london
reuters
opec
delivered
only
a
limited
increase
in
oil
production
in
september
a
reuters
survey
has
found
as
a
cut
in
iranian
shipments
due
to
sanctions
offset
higher
output
in
libya
saudi
arabia
and
angola
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
pumped
million
barrels
per
day
in
september
the
survey
on
monday
found
up
bpd
from
august
s
revised
level
and
the
highest
this
year
but
the
opec
members
bound
by
a
agreement
actually
cut
output
by
bpd
because
of
declines
in
iran
and
venezuela
boosting
compliance
with
supply
targets
to
percent
from
a
revised
percent
in
august
the
survey
found
oil
prices
have
extended
a
rally
this
year
on
expectations
the
sanctions
on
iran
will
test
opec
s
ability
to
replace
the
shortfall
despite
the
group
agreeing
in
june
to
pump
more
after
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
oil
on
monday
reached
a
barrel
the
highest
since
the
supply
situation
looks
fragile
indeed
as
any
additional
shortfall
such
as
a
deterioration
of
the
situation
in
venezuela
would
tighten
oil
supplies
said
norbert
r√ºcker
at
julius
baer
opec
s
june
agreement
involved
opec
russia
and
other
returning
to
percent
compliance
with
oil
output
cuts
that
began
in
january
after
months
of
underproduction
in
venezuela
and
elsewhere
pushed
adherence
above
percent
while
saudi
arabia
has
now
almost
fully
reversed
its
pledged
supply
cut
of
bpd
this
has
not
fully
offset
losses
in
iran
and
declining
output
in
venezuela
and
angola
the
biggest
increase
last
month
came
from
libya
where
production
averaged
above
million
bpd
the
survey
found
libyan
output
remains
volatile
due
to
unrest
raising
questions
about
the
stability
of
current
opec
output
angola
where
natural
declines
at
oilfields
have
been
curbing
production
in
recent
years
boosted
supply
in
september
due
to
supply
from
a
new
field
gindungo
output
is
still
far
below
its
opec
target
saudi
arabia
after
opening
the
taps
in
june
and
then
scaling
back
its
plans
to
pump
more
supplied
million
bpd
in
september
up
bpd
the
survey
found
the
recent
figure
was
still
lower
than
june
s
million
bpd
supply
in
nigeria
which
like
libya
is
exempt
from
the
opec
supply
cut
pact
because
its
output
is
often
curbed
by
unplanned
outages
due
to
unrest
and
conflict
rose
by
bpd
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
after
raising
output
in
july
following
the
opec
deal
kept
supply
little
changed
in
september
the
survey
found
among
countries
with
lower
output
the
biggest
drop
of
bpd
was
in
iran
exports
fell
as
returning
sanctions
discouraged
companies
from
buying
the
country
s
oil
production
also
slipped
further
in
venezuela
where
a
lack
of
funds
for
the
oil
industry
because
of
the
economic
crisis
is
cutting
refinery
operations
and
crude
exports
iraq
s
output
edged
lower
as
exports
from
the
south
of
the
country
did
not
hold
at
record
levels
for
the
whole
month
this
still
left
iraq
as
opec
s
least
compliant
member
in
september
according
to
the
survey
despite
these
decreases
opec
output
in
september
has
risen
to
the
highest
since
september
according
to
reuters
surveys
this
partly
reflects
the
addition
of
congo
republic
to
opec
in
june
not
just
increases
by
existing
members
before
congo
joined
opec
had
an
implied
production
target
for
of
million
bpd
based
on
cutbacks
detailed
in
late
and
nigeria
and
libya
s
expectations
of
output
according
to
the
survey
opec
excluding
congo
pumped
about
bpd
below
this
implied
target
in
september
the
survey
aims
to
track
supply
to
the
