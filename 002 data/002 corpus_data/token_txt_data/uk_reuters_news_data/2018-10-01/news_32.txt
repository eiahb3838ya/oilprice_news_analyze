when

stops
his
new
scooter
at
traffic
lights
in
malaysia
s
capital
fellow

sometimes
flash
their
lights
or
honk
their
horns
at
him
though
he
has
done
nothing
wrong
with
his
silent
electric
motorcycle
other

wrongfully
assume
the
has
turned
off
his
engine
or
fallen
asleep
at
the
wheel
but
the
delivery
driver
is
always
alert
especially
since
he
was
picked
to
take
part
in
a
new
pilot
project
run
by
logistics
giant
dhl
ecommerce
when
drivers
beep
at
him
or
wind
down
their
windows
jacob
lets
them
know
he
rides
an
electric
bike
that
makes
no
sound
parcel
delivery
firm
dhl
ecommerce
is
testing
electric
vehicles
in
malaysia
and
vietnam
for
a
year
as
it
works
towards
a
goal
of
cutting
its
greenhouse
gas
emissions
to
zero
by
as
well
as
helping
companies
boost
their
green
credentials
electric
vehicles
ease
air
pollution
and
can
reduce
a
country
s
costly
oil
imports
if
the
electricity
that
powers
them
is
from
renewable
sources
they
can
also
help
meet
the
emissions
reduction
targets
submitted
by
governments
for
the
paris
agreement
to
curb
climate
change
cities
in
the
region
have
seen
unprecedented
growth
over
the
last
two
decades
many
face
air
pollution
crises
crippling
congestion
and
other
challenges
related
to
mobility
and
infrastructure
tackling
noise
pollution
is
also
becoming
increasingly
important
to
improve
the
wellbeing
of
residents
the
dhl
project
is
rare
in
asia
which
experts
say
lags
other
regions
in
creating
the
right
incentives
regulatory
frameworks
and
infrastructure
needed
to
make
electric
vehicles
more
attractive
to
both
drivers
and
businesses
at
first
dhl
wanted
to
pilot
the
project
in
three
countries
but
regulatory
issues
and
limited
availability
of
in
thailand
prevented
it
from
launching
there
it
said
globally
the
group
hopes
to
replace
percent
of
all
the
vehicles
it
uses
for
first
and
delivery
services
with
cleaner
energy
versions
by
after
one
year
we
will
see
which
bike
does
the
best
and
how
practical
it
is
to
scale
up
and
look
at
more

anil
gautam
managing
director
for
dhl
ecommerce
malaysia
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
around
the
world
electric
and
hybrid
cars
topped
million
in
a
percent
jump
from
according
to
a
report
by
the
international
energy
agency
iea
china
was
the
largest
electric
car
market
accounting
for
half
sold
last
year
about
cars
facing
public
health
risks
from
increasingly
polluted
cities
the
chinese
government
has
put
in
place
clear
targets
for
electric
vehicle
sales
said
nick
twork
general
manager
for
innovation
and
technology
communications
at
the
alliance
in
paris
china
has
also
invested
in
technology
and
mass
production
to
bring
down
costs
and
make
electric
vehicles
more
affordable
he
added
the
united
states
had
the
number
of
vehicles
with
about
cars
sold
last
year
although
nordic
countries
lead
on
market
share
the
iea
said
norway
was
in
the
top
slot
with
electric
cars
making
up
percent
of
new
car
sales
china
and
japan
aside
experts
said
asian
governments
should
consult
more
with
industry
and
consumers
to
improve
policies
on
electric
vehicles
especially
as
the
economic
advantages
of
switching
to
electric
from
fossil
fuel
vehicles
are
slim
there
is
a
need
to
expand
infrastructure
for
electric
vehicle
charging
beyond
homes
and
work
places
a
key
barrier
to
of
electric
vehicles
in
the
region
said
dominic
patella
a
transport
specialist
with
the
world
bank
in
brussels
governments
can
also
provide
incentives
or
subsidies
for
electric
vehicle
buyers
including
registration
and
tax
breaks
for
sellers
experts
said
where
this
generally
works
is
when
you
have
close
cooperation
between
industry
and
government
and
there
are
economic
incentives
for
both
infrastructure
and
the
purchase
of
vehicles
said
twork
of
preferential
parking
and
lane
access
are
other
options
for
cities
many
of
which
already
ban
diesel
vehicles
from
the
centre
at
busy
times
of
day
or
have
curfews
to
reduce
noise
pollution
governments
meanwhile
can
make
it
easier
to
import
electric
vehicles
and
play
a
role
in
persuading
public
and
private
transport
providers
to
go
electric
sometimes
it
takes
government
intervention
to
enable
the
uptake
of
electric
mobility
and
that
s
where
you
need
good
policy
good
programmes
good
investments
to
enable
good
things
to
take
place
in
the
transport
sector
said
patella
businesses
like
parcel
delivery
and
taxi
companies
have
an
easier
route
to
switching
to
electric
fleets
because
they
can
track
routes
and
busy
times
and
recharge
during
quiet
periods
charging
time
for
the
dhl
scooters
is
between
to
minutes
for
a
range
of
about
km
miles
but
this
differs
depending
on
the
make
of
motorcycle
tested
weight
of
the
load
and
driver
battery
age
and
the
type
of
charger
used
most
privately
owned
electric
vehicles
take
hours
to
charge
up
a
process
usually
done
overnight
but
experts
said
the
cost
of
batteries
and
charge
times
are
falling
fast
between
and
aims
to
cut
the
cost
of
its
batteries
by
percent
with
a
charge
time
and
an
overall
range
of
km
while
electrified
delivery
fleets
are
expected
to
take
off
in
other
parts
of
the
world
first
asia
is
a
fast
follower
given
the
rise
in
parcel
delivery
and
freight
across
the
region
especially
from
china
said
andrew
campbell
who
provides
technical
support
for
the
philippines
project
the
programme
aims
to
electrify
and
replace
all
the
country
s
tuk
tuks
and
has
rolled
out
about
so
far
somewhere
between
the
five
and
mark
we
are
going
to
see
