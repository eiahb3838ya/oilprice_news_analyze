has
been

unseated
in
a
stunning

ringgit
billion
or
percent
of
the

of
two
pipeline
projects
awarded
to
china
petroleum

bureau
ccpb
although
they
are
less
than
percent
complete
we
have
discovered
that
the
payment
schedules
for
the
above
contracts
are
based
almost
entirely
on
timeline
milestones
and
not
on
progressive
work
completion
milestones
lim
said
in
a
statement
in
november
ccpb
won
the
contracts
to
build
a
petroleum
pipeline
along
the

of
peninsular
malaysia
and
the
gas
pipeline
in
eastern
sabah
state
lim
said
the
contracts
were
negotiated
directly
by
najib
s
office
and
the
former
prime
minister
had
ignored
red
flags
raised
by
the
s
office
on
both
deals
in

the
finance
ministry
raised
percent
of
the
project
funding
from
china
exim
bank
through
a
subsidiary
suria
strategic
energy
resources
sser
the
rest
was
raised
by
issuing
sukuk
or
bonds
both
the
china
exim
bank
borrowings
and
the
sukuk
are
secured
with
federal
government
guarantees
lim
added
in
a
statement
posted
on
his
facebook
page
najib
said
the
negotiations
and
execution
of
the
two
projects
complied
with
the
necessary
procedures
and
laws
the
said
he
welcomed
an
inquiry
into
the
projects
but
cautioned
lim
against
making
serious
politically
motivated
public

foreign
relations
and
international
trade
telephone
calls
from

to
ccpb
s

lim
said
he
had
ordered
a
report
filed
with
the
agency
and
the
ministry
would
consider
seeking
china

help
to
decide
if
