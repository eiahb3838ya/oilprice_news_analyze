car
sales
growth
in
western
europe
will
be
tempered
this
year
by
political
uncertainty
surrounding
italy
and
a
new
emissions
test
cycle
which
is
leading
to
higher
readings
of
carbon
dioxide
pollution
forecasters
lmc
automotive
said
lmc
has
lowered
its
forecast
for
sales
growth
in
western
europe
to
percent
from
percent
last
month
lmc
s
european
analyst
david
oakley
said
on
tuesday
several
carmakers
including
volkswagen
have
said
they
face
challenges
adapting
their
vehicle
fleets
to
meet
a
new
worldwide
harmonised
light
vehicle
test
procedure
wltp
which
is
based
on
data
rather
than
theoretical
scenarios
because
the
new
wltp
regime
gives
higher
readings
than
the
old
nedc
system
it
will
force
some
carmakers
to
delay
road
certification
and
sales
or
push
vehicles
into
a
higher
tax
bracket
the
elephant
in
the
room
at
the
moment
is
the
response
of
national
governments
and
manufacturers
to
the
new
wltp
emissions
and
fuel
economy
testing
procedure
which
has
the
potential
to
cause
significant
tax
increases
in
countries
which
have
taxation
regimes
based
on
emissions

explained
western
europe
sales
in
may
were
flat
when
compared
to
the
same
month
a
year
ago
which
lmc
automotive
said
was
a
good
result
given
that
there
were
fewer
selling
days
than
in
the
month
sales
in
italy
which
was
rocked
by
political
turmoil
last
month
fell
percent
in
may
based
on
the
seasonally
adjusted
annual
selling
rate
saar
demand
improved
to
million
cars
a
year
up
from
million
vehicles
in
april
despite
weak
demand
in
britain
which
is
down
percent
