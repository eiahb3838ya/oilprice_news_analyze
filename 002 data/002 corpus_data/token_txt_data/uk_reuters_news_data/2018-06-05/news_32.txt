new
ideas
proposed
in
mediation
of
an
maritime
dispute
over
oil
and
gas
exploration
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
raise
the
prospect
of
a
partial
deal
this
year
israel
s
energy
minister
said
israel
kicked
off
a
gas
bonanza
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
almost
a
decade
ago
with
the
discovery
of
two
huge
gas
fields
others
were
found
in
egypt
and
cyprus
and
companies
are
now
exploring
lebanese
waters
as
well
one
of
the
lebanese
blocks
being
explored
block
borders
israel
s
maritime
zone
and
contains
waters
claimed
by
both
countries
the
disputed
border
also
touches
two
other
lebanese
blocks
this
has
led
to
years
of
brinkmanship
with
officials
on
both
sides
promising
to
protect
their
resources
and
warning
about
encroachment
there
are
some
new
ideas
on
the
table
more
than
that
i
can
not
discuss
energy
minister
yuval
steinitz
said
in
a
reuters
interview
he
oversees
energy
exploration
in
israel
and
is
the
pointman
in
indirect
negotiations
with
lebanon
david
satterfield
the
acting
assistant
secretary
of
state
for
near
eastern
affairs
has
shuttled
between
the
countries
in
recent
months
as
a
mediator
steinitz
said
that
president
donald
trump
s
middle
east
peace
negotiator
jason
greenblatt
has
also
been
involved
there
is
room
for
cautious
optimism
but
not
beyond
cautious
steinitz
said
i
hope
that
in
the
coming
months
or
by
the
end
of
the
year
we
will
manage
to
reach
a
solution
or
at
least
a
partial
solution
to
the
but
he
added
nothing
has
been
settled
even
a
partial
agreement
would
be
a
major
diplomatic
achievement
as
well
as
timely
since
both
lebanon
and
israel
are
planning
new
rounds
of
tenders
for
offshore
exploration
a
spokeswoman
for
lebanon
s
energy
and
water
minister
cesar
abi
khalil
declined
to
comment
on
the
negotiations
between
lebanon
and
israel
or
the
specific
points
raised
by
steinitz
israel
recently
warned
energy
companies
in
lebanon
not
to
drill
close
to
its
border
and
the
consortium
set
to
explore
block
made
up
of
france
s
total
italy
s
eni
and
russia
s
novatek
has
said
it
would
stay
away
from
the
disputed
area
steinitz
also
said
he
expected
israel
to
begin
a
new
round
of
tenders
for
offshore
blocks
sometime
between
september
and
november
the
new
offshore
exploration
licences
will
be
modified
to
make
them
more
attractive
to
energy
groups
after
a
previous
auction
got
a
tepid
response
steinitz
said
israel
launched
a
bidding
round
in
november
after
a
number
of
the
fields
were
found
in
israeli
waters
it
accepted
the
only
two
bids
it
received
from
greece
s
energean
and
a
consortium
of
indian
firms
including
ongc
videsh
bharat
petroresources
indian
oil
corp
and
oil
india
steinitz
said
there
were
lessons
to
be
learned
we
will
change
the
method
in
a
way
that
it
will
be
more
accessible
and
attractive
he
said
without
elaborating
additionally
i
think
there
were
two
developments
that
will
make
the
exploration
more
he
said
companies
were
put
off
by
concerns
that
they
might
not
find
a
buyer
for
gas
they
discovered
since
israel
has
a
gas
surplus
and
export
options
at
the
time
were
limited
but
he
said
that
had
changed
referring
to
the
opening
of
two
markets
over
the
past
year
progress
has
been
made
in
plans
for
an
subsea
gas
pipeline
and
a
billion
export
deal
to
egypt
