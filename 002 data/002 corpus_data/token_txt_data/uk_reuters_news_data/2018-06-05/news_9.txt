washington
reuters
the
united
states
warned
governments
and
the
private
sector
on
tuesday
to
crack
down
on
what
it
described
as
iranian
efforts
to
exploit
them
to
fund
its
support
for
terrorism
destabilizing
actions
in
the
region
and
rights
abuses
at
home
the
appeal
in
a
speech
by
the
senior
treasury
official
for
terrorism
and
financial
intelligence
follows
president
donald
trump
s
may
decision
to
abandon
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
to
reimpose
sanctions
on
the
islamic
republic
you
must
harden
your
financial
networks
require
your
companies
to
do
extra
due
diligence
to
keep
them
from
being
caught
in
iran
s
deceptive
web
and
make
clear
the
very
significant
risks
of
doing
business
with
companies
and
persons
there
under
secretary
of
the
treasury
sigal
mandelker
said
companies
doing
business
in
iran
face
substantial
risks
and
those
risks
are
even
greater
as
we
reimpose
sanctions
she
added
we
will
hold
those
doing
prohibited
business
in
iran
to
the
decision
to
leave
the
pact
under
which
iran
agreed
to
limit
its
nuclear
program
in
return
for
relief
from
economic
sanctions
has
antagonized
its
other
parties
britain
china
france
germany
and
russia
with
sanctions
returning
between
now
and
it
is
not
clear
how
enthusiastic
allies
or
other
nations
such
as
china
may
be
to
comply
with
those
sanctions
particularly
those
requiring
foreign
firms
to
reduce
their
imports
of
iranian
oil
the
weight
of
the
financial
system
and
the
reality
of
companies
having
to
choose
between
selling
to
iran
or
to
the
vast
market
is
likely
to
force
many
private
firms
to
comply
to
those
in
the
private
sector
i
urge
you
to
also
take
additional
steps
to
ensure
iran
and
its
proxies
are
not
exploiting
your
companies
to
support
their
nefarious
activities
mandelker
said
you
have
to
do
more
to
make
sure
your
compliance
programs
are
the
iranian
regime
will
deceive
your
companies
undermine
the
integrity
of
your
financial
systems
put
your
institutions
at
risk
of
our
powerful
sanctions
all
to
fund
terrorism
human
rights
abuses
and
terrorist
groups
mandelker
added
she
repeated
threats
to
increase
financial
pressure
unless
iran
ceases
actions
such
as
supporting
proxy
forces
hostile
to
the
united
states
in
syria
iraq
lebanon
and
yemen
our
powerful
economic
authorities
will
give
the
regime
a
clear
choice
change
its
unacceptable
support
for
terrorism
destabilizing
activities
and
human
rights
abuses
or
face
economic
calamity
