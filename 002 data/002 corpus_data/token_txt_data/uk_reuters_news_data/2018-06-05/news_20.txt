cross-border power flows may be disrupted as sweden replaces old grid

sweden
s
plans
to
renew
its
power
grid
in
the
densely
populated
southwest
region
may
disrupt
supplies
that
run
through
the
area
to
neighboring
states
operator
svenska
kraftnat
svk
said
some
kms
miles
of
electricity
lines
will
be
gradually
replaced
in
the
next
decade
in
an
area
through
which
swedish
power
and
supplies
from
norway
with
its
abundant
and
cheap
hyrdropower
flow
to
denmark
germany
and
other
countries
svk
did
not
give
details
of
the
extent
of
any
disruption
to
its
interconnections
as
the
upgrade
was
still
in
the
planning
phase
but
it
said
the
risk
of
unscheduled
interruptions
or
blackouts
would
rise
if
the
work
was
not
carried
out
in
the
oldest
parts
of
the
transmission
grid
s
kv
power
lines
will
approach
an
age
of
years
and
parts
of
the
kv
grid
are
even
older
so
old
that
it
is
no
longer
enough
to
maintain
them
svk
said
in
a
statement
to
reuters
replacing
the
grid
along
sweden
s
west
coast
would
cost
roughly
billion
swedish
crowns
million
and
would
require
decommissioning
of
some
local
lines
that
are
used
as
international
interconnectors
it
said
the
existing
power
line
needs
to
be
out
of
commission
for
periods
while
the
new
one
is
being
built
it
said
upgrading
the
grid
is
only
part
of
the
renovation
taking
place
between
and
svk
said
adding
that
further
components
in
the
national
network
would
also
be
renewed
about
substations
control
facilities
and
reactors
and
transformers
are
due
for
renewal
svenska
kraftnat
said
adding
that
nearly
devices
would
be
replaced
if
the
power
lines
are
not
replaced
before
they
get
too
old
the
risk
of
interruptions
increases
and
so
does
the
risk
of
blackouts
svk
said
in
a
statement
power
line
replacements
will
not
cause
risk
to
the
electricity
supply
of
the
data
centers
of
the
region
