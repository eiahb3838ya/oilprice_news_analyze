ukraine
s
naftogaz
said
on
tuesday
a
dutch
court
had
approved
its
petition
to
freeze
dutch
assets
of
gazprom
to
enforce
an
arbitration
ruling
that
naftogaz
should
receive
billion
from
the
russian
company
that
ruling
made
by
the
stockholm
arbitration
court
in
february
was
meant
to
conclude
a
legal
battle
over
gas
deliveries
but
naftogaz
says
gazprom
has
not
complied
with
the
ruling
which
obliged
the
russian
company
to
resume
gas
supplies
to
ukraine
at
market
equivalent
prices
and
pay
billion
naftogaz
said
last
month
it
would
go
to
court
to
seize
gazprom
assets
in
europe
but
would
not
touch
russian
gas
transit
through
ukraine
last
week
the
ukrainian
firm
said
it
had
also
asked
swiss
courts
to
enforce
the
arbitration
award
and
swiss
authorities
have
taken
measures
against
gazprom
s
assets
too
the
legal
battle
has
run
alongside
ukraine
s
broader
political
with
russia
gazprom
appealed
against
the
stockholm
ruling
in
april
and
the
case
is
ongoing
ukraine
is
a
major
transit
country
for
russian
gas
supplies
to
europe
where
gazprom
accounts
for
around
percent
of
the
gas
market
