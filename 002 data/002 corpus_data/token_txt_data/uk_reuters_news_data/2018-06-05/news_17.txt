eu pushes back against weakening of aviation emissions deal
brussels
reuters
european
countries
are
pushing
back
against
any
weakening
of
the
rules
underpinning
a
landmark
global
agreement
to
cap
airline
emissions
at
levels
especially
those
related
to
the
types
of
aviation
biofuels
that
can
be
used
france
norway
finland
belgium
austria
and
the
netherlands
have
written
to
the
aviation
agency
which
brokered
the
deal
to
say
they
would
have
to
reconsider
their
support
should
the
compromise
be
weakened
this
related
particularly
to
criteria
for
the
sustainability
of
alternative
fuels
and
the
carbon
credits
used
to
offset
emissions
according
to
documents
seen
by
reuters
countries
at
the
international
civil
aviation
organisation
icao
are
seeking
to
agree
on
rules
that
will
govern
how
the
overall
deal
known
as
the
carbon
offset
and
reduction
scheme
for
international
aviation
corsia
will
be
implemented
they
meet
next
week
to
try
to
find
a
compromise
if
some
countries
were
to
call
into
question
certain
aspects
of
the
compromise
notably
with
regards
to
the
emissions
units
and
the
sustainability
of
alternative
fuels
the
support
given
by
france
to
this
version
of
the
text
would
be
compromised
france
wrote
in
a
letter
to
icao
aviation
biofuels
now
produced
in
small
volumes
from
renewable
sources
are
expected
to
play
an
important
role
in
delivering
the
goal
of
growth
in
airline
emissions
from
but
objections
from
several
developing
countries
meant
that
the
criteria
for
sustainable
biofuels
were
provisionally
scaled
down
to
two
from
originally
the
two
remaining
criteria
ensure
aviation
biofuels
are
not
produced
on
land
from
razed
forests
or
wetlands
and
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
at
least
percent
compared
with
conventional
jet
fuel
but
the
netherlands
said
in
its
letter
that
those
criteria
were
not
sufficient
to
ensure
environmental
integrity
and
sustainability
of
aviation
alternative
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
he
does
not
believe
the
european
countries
would
abandon
corsia
and
relinquish
their
voice
at
the
he
said
some
developing
countries
were
concerned
that
if
the
standards
were
too
strict
it
would
prevent
them
from
building
their
own
biojet
fuel
industries
on
agricultural
land
if
you
say
that
biofuel
can
t
displace
crops
then
you
have
to
go
into
the
forest
but
you
can
t
go
into
the
forest
said
the
source
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
the
talks
are
confidential
so
where
do
i
grow
in
the
sea
in
addition
the
six
countries
are
pushing
for
strict
rules
on
the
carbon
credits
that
airlines
will
have
to
purchase
from
environmental
projects
to
offset
their
emissions
the
programs
and
projects
should
represent
real
additional
permanent
and
verified
reductions
of
greenhouse
gases
that
are
accounted
for
only
once
toward
any
climate
mitigation
or
voluntary
action
norway
wrote
in
its
letter
to
icao
adding
that
eligible
projects
should
only
be
those
that
start
after
the
end
of
the
airline
industry
has
supported
a
single
global
deal
over
a
patchwork
of
regional
measures
like
the
eu
s
emissions
trading
system
and
in
february
called
on
governments
to
approve
the
rules
that
will
govern
how
corsia
is
implemented
