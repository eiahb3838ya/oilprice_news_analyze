growing
brazilian
government
meddling
in
petrobras
that
prompted
its
former
chief
executive
pedro
parente
to
quit
last
week
now
looms
over
his
successor
as
he
seeks
to
crack
on
with
reforms
at
the
world
s
most
indebted
oil
company
after
a
trucker
s
strike
over
rising
diesel
prices
paralyzed
latin
america
s
largest
economy
the
government
reacted
by
imposing
fuel
subsidies
worrying
investors
who
saw
it
as
a
sign
of
new
unwelcome
interference
in
petrobras
parente
resigned
in
protest
and
former
chief
financial
officer
ivan
monteiro
was
installed
in
his
place
on
friday
providing
some
comfort
to
jittery
markets
which
hope
he
will
press
on
with
parente
s
program
shares
in
petrobras
formally
called
petroleo
brasileiro
sa
rose
more
than
percent
on
monday
helped
by
the
decision
to
name
monteiro
ceo
as
well
as
by
some
after
the
shares
lost
about
a
fifth
of
their
value
however
it
is
unlikely
that
former
bank
executive
monteiro
will
be
able
to
escape
government
pressure
analysts
said
in
the
days
following
his
appointment
monteiro
may
want
to
turn
petrobras
into
a
streamlined
profit
machine
but
outgoing
president
michel
temer
and
other
politicians
are
scrambling
to
appease
angry
voters
ahead
of
presidential
polls
in
october
ivan
monteiro
will
be
under
serious
political
pressure
because
of
the
elections
said
edmar
almeida
an
energy
professor
at
the
federal
university
of
rio
de
janeiro
candidates
who
are
against
asset
sales
for
example
will
push
hard
against
any
major
petrobras
decision
on
petrobras
was
not
immediately
available
to
comment
a
spokesman
for
the
president
s
office
said
that
the
government
would
not
meddle
in
pricing
temer
effectively
ended
the
truckers
protest
after
he
promised
to
cut
diesel
prices
by
about
percent
for
days
through
a
mix
of
tax
cuts
and
subsidies
to
petrobras
the
government
also
agreed
to
restrict
price
changes
at
the
pump
reimbursing
petrobras
for
related
losses
in
another
sign
of
a
heavier
government
hand
the
mining
and
energy
ministry
said
on
friday
it
was
seeking
a
mechanism
to
protect
the
consumer
from
the
volatility
of
fuel
prices
at
the
but
details
have
been
scarce
as
to
how
petrobras
will
be
compensated
and
investors
are
wary
of
further
meddling
especially
steps
that
could
extend
beyond
diesel
to
gasoline
the
diesel
subsidy
plan
and
parente
s
exit
have
all
raised
questions
and
increased
the
risk
perception
of
political
interference
analysts
at
brazilian
bank
itau
said
in
a
client
note
a
election
will
add
further
pressure
on
the
government
to
keep
voters
happy
leftist
candidate
ciro
gomes
said
in
a
video
it
is
not
enough
for
parente
to
go
it
is
necessary
to
demand
that
the
pricing
policy
that
he
imposed
be
parente
had
insisted
as
a
condition
of
taking
the
and
company
s
helm
in
that
he
control
how
petrobras
priced
fuel
monteiro
seen
by
oil
companies
and
investors
as
an
avid
supporter
of
changes
sought
by
parente
is
not
expected
to
get
the
same
from
the
government
as
his
predecessor
as
the
political
mood
in
brasilia
has
shifted
future
reforms
are
going
to
be
met
with
a
jaundiced
eye
said
allen
good
an
analyst
at
morningstar
more
than
just
potential
losses
from
fuel
pricing
are
at
stake
petrobras
is
hoping
to
sell
majority
stakes
in
four
refineries
but
possible
investors
are
already
spooked
by
the
prospect
of
competing
with
a
company
that
is
forced
to
sell
fuel
below
cost
sources
told
reuters
last
month
an
aggressive
divestment
target
of
billion
by
the
end
of
part
of
a
bid
to
cut
debt
could
also
be
in
play
but
a
round
of
bidding
for
oil
blocks
in
brazil
s
choice
offshore
basins
on
thursday
is
not
expected
to
be
affected
say
oil
majors
who
will
likely
partner
with
petrobras
to
win
some
of
the
blocks
and
some
see
potential
benefits
from
parente
s
exit
including
the
possibility
of
a
quicker
conclusion
to
a
dispute
with
the
government
over
the
value
of
the
offshore
area
where
petrobras
paid
top
dollar
to
produce
billion
barrels
of
oil
oil
majors
are
watching
the
negotiations
closely
because
a
resolution
could
unlock
an
auction
of
nearby
areas
considered
to
be
some
of
the
finest
geology
in
brazil
s
play
i
would
guess
the
will
be
resolved
because
ivan
is
more
compliant
than
pedro
parente
