malaysia
s
finance
minister
on
tuesday
announced
plans
to
report
to
the
agency
upfront
payments
of
billions
of
ringgit
the
previous
administration
made
to
a
chinese
firm
for
two
pipeline
projects
that
have
barely
begun
since
taking
office
two
weeks
ago
lim
guan
eng
has
been
driving
a
campaign
to
expose
financial
scandals
in
the
administration
of
former
prime
minister
najib
razak
unseated
in
a
stunning
election
defeat
last
month
lim
said
najib
s
government
had
paid
billion
ringgit
billion
or
percent
of
the
total
value
of
two
pipeline
projects
awarded
to
china
petroleum
pipeline
bureau
ccpb
although
they
are
less
than
percent
complete
we
have
discovered
that
the
payment
schedules
for
the
above
contracts
are
based
almost
entirely
on
timeline
milestones
and
not
on
progressive
work
completion
milestones
lim
said
in
a
statement
in
november
ccpb
won
the
contracts
to
build
a
petroleum
pipeline
along
the
west
coast
of
peninsular
malaysia
and
the
gas
pipeline
in
eastern
sabah
state
lim
said
the
contracts
were
negotiated
directly
by
najib
s
office
and
the
former
prime
minister
had
ignored
red
flags
raised
by
the
s
office
on
both
deals
in
march
the
finance
ministry
raised
percent
of
the
project
funding
from
china
exim
bank
through
a
subsidiary
suria
strategic
energy
resources
sser
the
rest
was
raised
by
issuing
sukuk
or
bonds
both
the
china
exim
bank
borrowings
and
the
sukuk
are
secured
with
federal
government
guarantees
lim
added
telephone
calls
from
reuters
to
ccpb
s
office
numbers
listed
on
its
website
were
not
answered
an
aide
to
najib
could
not
respond
immediately
to
a
request
for
comment
over
text
lim
said
he
had
ordered
a
report
filed
with
the
agency
and
the
ministry
would
consider
seeking
china
s
help
to
decide
if
moneylaundering
figured
in
either
deal
najib
and
his
family
had
been
dogged
during
the
last
three
years
of
his
rule
by
a
scandal
over
billions
of
dollars
allegedly
siphoned
from
state
fund
development
berhad
and
a
key
reason
for
his
may
election
defeat
is
also
the
subject
of
probes
in
at
least
six
countries
including
the
united
states
switzerland
and
singapore
najib
has
denied
any
wrongdoing
last
week
lim
said
malaysia
would
have
to
pay
debts
of
about
billion
ringgit
racked
up

ringgit
