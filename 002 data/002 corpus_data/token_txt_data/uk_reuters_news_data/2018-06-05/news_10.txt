with
iran
after
withdrawing
from
a
nuclear
deal
with
tehran
the
european
union
once
iran
s
biggest
oil
importer
is
looking
for
ways
to
save
the
nuclear
accord
and
safeguard
investments
made
by
european
companies
but
the
risk
of
running
foul
of
sanctions
and
losing
access
to

system
has
caused
many
companies
to
reassess
their
plans

it
might
pull
out
of
its

said
that
evaluations
it
had
carried
out
so
far
in

to
its
limited

not
point

any
need
to
request
specific
waivers
in
any
event
such
activities
would
only
be
carried
out
to
the
extent
sanctions
allow
them
