insight-europe up against asian juggernaut in electric car battery drive
reuters
chinese
electric
vehicle
giant
byd
is
looking
at
launching
battery
production
in
europe
joining
asian
rivals
aiming
to
cash
in
on
a
green
car
revolution
and
threatening
attempts
by
brussels
to
nurture
a
industry
keen
to
capture
a
european
car
battery
value
chain
that
will
be
worth
an
estimated
billion
euros
billion
pounds
by
the
european
commission
launched
an
alliance
of
local
companies
last
year
aiming
to
build
huge
battery
factories
but
only
sweden
s
northvolt
and
germany
s
terrae
have
plans
for
large
battery
factories
in
europe
so
far
and
some
leading
european
carmakers
have
already
struck
deals
with
asian
suppliers
setting
up
in
hungary
and
poland
we
are
considering
cell
production
outside
of
china
and
that
includes
europe
julia
chen
global
sales
director
at
byd
batteries
told
reuters
speaking
about
the
production
of
both
automotive
and
home
storage
batteries
byd
which
also
makes
electric
buses
cars
and
solar
panels
said
it
was
not
clear
where
in
europe
a
battery
site
might
be
it
would
be
possible
wherever
there

which
is
backed

both
have
european
factories
due
to
open
soon
while
china
s
gsr
capital
already
produces
battery
cells
at
a
uk
plant
it
bought
from
nissan
while
asian
electric
vehicle
ev
cell
battery
factories
in
europe
would
bring
jobs
brussels
is
concerned
companies
in
the
bloc
are
missing
out
on
a
growth
industry
and
risk
becoming
dependent
on
foreign
technology
we
have
to
move
fast
because
here
we
are
in
a
global
race
we
need
to
prevent
technological
dependence
on
competitors
european
commission
vice
president
maros
sefcovic
said
at
the
launch
of
the
european
battery
alliance
s
action
plan
in
may
but
some
investors
say
they
are
wary
of
backing
european
ev
battery
suppliers
after
seeing
local
solar
panel
firms
founder
in
the
face
of
cheap
chinese
imports
over
the
past
decade
european
battery
companies
would
need
billions
in
eu
support
to
rival
asian
firms
that
have
received
similar
state
subsidies
and
brussels
may
be
better
off
promoting
ev
batteries
instead
investors
say
i
don
t
believe
anyone
in
europe
can
be
competitive
with
the
asians

electric

are
expected
to
account
for
percent
of
the
global
auto
market
by
according
to
metal
consultants
cru
up
from
percent
of
the
million
vehicles
sold
last
year
global
automakers
plan
to
invest
at
least
billion
in
electric
cars
and
batteries
the
most
expensive
component
in
the
vehicles
to
finance
hundreds
of
new
models
over
the
next
five
years
for
now
carmakers
in
europe
have
been
importing
batteries
from
asia
but
as
production
ramps
up
that
will
become
less
viable
setting
up
production
in
europe
would
cut
shipping
costs
by
a
quarter
consultancy
group
estimates
but
some
carmakers
are
not
waiting
for
a
european
industry
instead
signing
contracts
with
asian
firms
coming
to
the
region
german
s
bmw
said
it
was
not
involved
in
the
european
alliance
while
europe

biggest
automaker

said
it
plans
to
get
batteries
from

trademark
supporters
of
the
initiative
argue
europe
can
carve
out
a
niche
by
selling
green
batteries
produced
with
renewable
energy
and
ethically
sourced
raw
materials
northvolt
which
has
held
talks
with
european
automakers
aims
to
launch
its
billion
gigafactory
in
late
and
produce
gigawatt
hours
of
battery
capacity
each
year
by
but
investors
have
been
cautious
about
pouring
money
into
new
european
battery
ventures
northvolt
s
first
financing
round
intended
to
raise
million
euros
to
million
euros
to
help
set
up
a
test
factory
took
slightly
longer
than
expected
a
spokesman
said
in
the
end
the
bulk
of
the
financing
was
provided
by
the
swedish
energy
agency
and
the
european
investment
bank
which
provided
a
loan
of
up
to
million
euros
much
of
the
profit
from
the
battery
value
chain
is
generated
by
producers
of
raw
materials
such
as
cobalt
and
lithium
and
those
who
assemble
cells
into
complex
systems
experts
say
there
s
been
a
bit
of
imbalance
in
that
value
chain
and
that
s
one
of
the
reasons
you
see
a
limited
amount
of
players
in
europe
said
northvolt
founder
and
chief
executive
peter
carlsson
but
we
think
that
the
model
that
we
re
applying
is
changing
carlsson
who
used
to
work
for
electric
car
pioneer
tesla
says
northvolt
can
make
a
profit
through
economies
of
scale
by
using
cheap
hydropower
and
controlling
the
processing
of
raw
materials
but
northvolt
and
terrae
will
probably
need
about
billion
each
in
government
funding
to
build
their
gigafactories
given
the
state
support
provided
for
similar
projects
in
asia
and
the
united
states
said
asad
farid
an
associate
director
at
private
bank
berenberg
who
specialises
in
battery
technology
four
months
after
the
european
alliance
launch
the
world
s
biggest
automotive
supplier
germany
s
robert
bosch
abandoned
plans
to
make
battery
cells
saying
it
was
too
risky
solution
investors
are
wary
because
of
their
experience
with
solar
panel
manufacturers
as
well
as
rapid
advances
in
technology
that
are
slashing
the
price
of
battery
packs
which
consultants
arthur
d
little
puts
at
per
kilowatt
hour
now
in
battery
manufacturing
it
very
much
about
scale
so
the
established
producers
in
korea
china
and
japan
have
clear
advantages
over
new
entrants
said
simon
webber
lead
portfolio
manager
on
the
global
international
equities
team
at
schroders
tim
crockford
who
manages
hermes
investment
management
impact
opportunities
fund
here
said
he
was
more
interested
in
european
firms
researching
cathode
technology
areas
with
major
barriers
to
entry
in
terms
of
research
and
development
the
attraction
of
the
industry
decreases
as
you
move
further
down
the
value
chain
things
like
battery
manufacturers
and
the
battery
pack
assemblers
it
s
much
more
fragmented
market
with
lower
barriers
to
entry
said
crockford
while
hermes
has
avoided
companies
ev
cell
batteries
it
has
taken
stakes
in
a
lithium
producer
and
a
company
that
makes
materials
for
battery
cathodes
he
said
the
batteries
used
now
are
also
likely
to
be
overtaken
in
a
matter
of
years
by
technology
that
is
expected
to
produce
even
cheaper
batteries
with
higher
energy
density
the
development
cycle
and
the
speed
of
technology
progress
in
batteries
is
so
huge
at
the
moment
there
an
opportunity
for
new
and
additional
players
to
enter
said
timo
moeller
head
of
the
mckinsey
center
for
future
mobility
here
in
cologne
developers
in
europe
believe
that
gives
the
region
an
opportunity
to
catch
up
everybody
is
developing
batteries
so
the
gap
with
asia
will
be
narrower
and
narrower
as
we
go
along
