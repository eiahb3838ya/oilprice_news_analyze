ban plastic bags? un seeks to cut pollution as recycling falls short
oslo
reuters
less
than
a
of
all
the
plastic
ever
made
has
been
recycled
and
governments
should
consider
banning
or
taxing
bags
or
food
containers
to
stem
a
tide
of
pollution
a
report
said
on
tuesday
world
environment
day
the
study
billed
as
the
most
comprehensive
review
of
government
action
to
curb
plastics
said
up
to
trillion
plastic
bags
were
used
worldwide
each
year
spread
out
they
would
cover
an
area
twice
the
size
of
france
the
scourge
of
plastic
has
reached
every
corner
of
the
earth
erik
solheim
head
of
environment
wrote
in
the
report
compiled
with
the
indian
government
and
launched
along
with
a
slogan
if
you
can
t
reuse
it
refuse
only
percent
of
the
billion
tonnes
of
plastic
the
world
has
ever
produced
has
been
recycled
the
report
said
most
ends
up
in
landfills
dumps
or
in
the
china
is
the
biggest
source
of
plastic
packaging
waste
ahead
of
the
european
union
and
the
united
states
per
capita
however
the
united
states
produces
most
ahead
of
japan
and
the
eu
but
there
are
signs
of
action
to
limit
plastic
pollution
which
harms
life
in
the
oceans
contaminates
soils
and
releases
toxic
chemicals
when
burnt
targeted
levies
and
bans
where
properly
planned
and
enforced
have
been
among
the
most
effective
strategies
to
limit
overuse
of
disposable
plastic
products
the
report
said
elisa
tonda
who
leads
environment
s
sustainable
lifestyle
program
said
more
than
countries
had
bans
or
charges
on
plastics
such
as
bags
or
polystyrene
containers
thirty
percent
of
countries
found
sharp
drops
in
plastic
bag
consumption
in
the
first
year
after
imposing
restrictions
while
percent
saw
little
or
no
change
but
in
half
the
cases
governments
failed
to
gauge
the
effects
of
restrictions
the
report
said
among
its
recommendations
the
report
called
for
better
sorting
of
waste
and
recycling
economic
incentives
to
promote
alternatives
to
plastics
education
of
consumers
and
promotion
of
reusable
products
the
report
also
found
other
cultural
in
south
africa
plastic
litter
is
jokingly
referred
to
as
the
new
national
flower
in
ireland
windblown
plastic
bags
caught
in
trees
are
referred
to
as
witch
s
knickers
