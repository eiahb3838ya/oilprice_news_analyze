a
river
of
lava
spewing
from
the
foot
of
hawaii
s
kilauea
volcano
swallowed
about
three
dozen
more
homes
on
the
big
island
during
a
weekend
of
destruction
that
brought
to
nearly
the
number
of
dwellings
devoured
since
last
month
officials
said
on
monday
mounting
property
losses
were
reported
a
day
after
five
or
six
people
who
initially
chose
to
stay
in
the
newly
evacuated
kapoho
area
after
road
access
was
cut
off
were
rescued
by
helicopter
according
to
the
hawaii
county
civil
defense
agency
all
but
a
few
of
the
estimated
inhabitants
of
kapoho
and
adjacent
vacationland
development
are
now
believed
to
have
fled
their
homes
an
agency
spokesman
said
the
area
lies
near
the
site
of
a
seaside
village
buried
in
lava
from
a
eruption
the
latest
damage
came
from
a
large
lava
flow
that
crept
several
miles
km
before
severing
a
key
highway
junction
at
kapoho
on
saturday
and
then
obliterating
about
a
half
dozen
blocks
of
the
subdivision
over
the
weekend
the
spokesman
said
one
finger
of
the
lava
poured
into
a
small
freshwater
lake
boiling
away
all
its
water
late
on
saturday
while
another
finger
spilled
into
kapoho
bay
on
sunday
night
officials
said
on
monday
civil
defense
reported
a
total
of
homes
and
other
structures
destroyed
across
the
island
s
larger
region
as
the
eruption
from
kilauea
one
of
the
world
s
most
active
volcanoes
continued
through
its
day
about
three
dozen
of
those
structures
mostly
private
homes
and
vacation
rentals
were
lost
during
the
weekend
in
kapoho
the
rest
were
consumed
weeks
earlier
in
the
larger
leilani
estates
subdivision
several
miles
km
to
the
west
where
fissures
in
the
ground
first
opened
on
may
about
residents
have
been
displaced
from
leilani
since
earlier
this
month
as
fountains
of
lava
and
high
concentrations
of
toxic
sulfur
dioxide
gas
continued
unabated
a
mandatory
evacuation
of
much
the
subdivision
was
imposed
last
week
plumes
of
volcanic
ash
belched
into
the
air
by
periodic
daily
explosions
from
the
crater
at
kilauea
s
summit
have
posed
an
additional
nuisance
and
a
health
concern
to
nearby
communities
so
too
have
airborne
volcanic
glass
fibers
called
pele
s
hair
wispy
strands
carried
aloft
by
the
wind
from
lava
fountains
and
named
for
the
volcano
goddess
of
hawaiian
myth
seaside
residents
and
boaters
also
have
been
warned
to
avoid
noxious
clouds
of
laze
a
term
combining
the
words
lava
and
haze
formed
when
lava
reacts
with
seawater
to
form
a
mix
of
acid
fumes
steam
and
specks
lava
flows
have
knocked
out
telephone
and
power
lines
causing
widespread
communication
outages
and
forced
the
shutdown
of
a
geothermal
energy
plant
that
normally
provides
about
a
quarter
of
the
island
s
electricity
at
the
same
time
most
of
the
hawaii
volcanoes
national
park
one
of
the
island
s
biggest
tourist
attractions
remains
closed
indefinitely
due
to
hazards
from
ash
and
volcanic
rock
ejected
from
the
summit
crater
and
accompanying
earthquakes
that
have
damaged
park
facilities
kilauea
s
current
upheaval
comes
on
the
heels
of
an
eruption
cycle
that
began
in
and
had
continued
nearly
nonstop
for
years
destroying
more
than
homes
scientists
say
they
are
unsure
whether
the
latest
activity
is
part
of
the
same
eruption
phase
or
a
new
one
and
how
long
it
may
last
