exclusive, update 2-opec and allies consider oil output boost as iranian supply falls -source
algiers
reuters
opec
and
other
oil
producers
are
discussing
the
possibility
of
raising
output
by
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
counter
falling
supply
from
iran
because
of
sanctions
a
source
familiar
with
the
discussions
told
reuters
the
development
comes
as
oil
reached
a
barrel
this
month
prompting
president
donald
trump
to
call
again
on
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
to
help
to
bring
down
prices
opec
russia
and
other
allies
agreed
a
deal
in
late
to
cut
supply
but
after
months
of
cutting
by
more
than
the
pact
had
called
for
they
agreed
in
june
to
boost
output
by
returning
to
percent
compliance
that
equates
to
an
increase
of
about
million
bpd
the
current
discussions
are
not
finalised
but
it
would
mean
that
oil
producers
would
need
to
lower
compliance
to
less
than
percent
the
source
said
on
friday
benchmark
brent
oil
prices
fell
by
more
than
on
the
news
of
a
potential
output
boost
slipping
to
below
a
barrel
opec
and
its
allies
will
gather
in
algeria
over
the
weekend
to
review
compliance
with
existing
cuts
three
opec
and
sources
told
reuters
on
friday
that
latest
data
has
shown
that
opec
and
its
allies
supplied
less
oil
in
august
to
world
markets
than
they
did
in
july
mainly
because
of
a
drop
in
iranian
production
in
july
opec
and
producers
reduced
output
by
percent
more
than
called
for
in
their
pact
the
cut
in
august
was
even
higher
the
three
sources
said
without
providing
exact
figures
which
will
be
discussed
in
algiers
this
weekend
opec
sources
said
that
any
official
action
to
raise
output
would
require
opec
to
hold
what
it
calls
an
extraordinary
meeting
a
proposal
that
is
not
on
the
table
yet
but
the
joint
opec
and
ministerial
committee
known
as
the
jmmc
which
meets
on
sunday
can
still
recommend
a
further
increase
in
output
if
needed
the
sources
said
there
are
discussions
to
increase
production
by
another
bpd
they
opec
and
can
increase
output
when
they
meet
in
december
the
source
said
referring
to
the
next
formal
opec
meeting
scheduled
for
on
thursday
president
trump
linked
american
support
for
middle
eastern
countries
to
oil
prices
as
he
again
urged
opec
to
lower
prices
we
protect
the
countries
of
the
middle
east
they
would
not
be
safe
for
very
long
without
us
and
yet
they
continue
to
push
for
higher
and
higher
oil
prices
we
will
remember
the
opec
monopoly
must
get
prices
down
now
trump
wrote
on
twitter
opec
s
july
decision
to
raise
oil
production
also
followed
a
series
of
trump
tweets
rising
gasoline
prices
could
create
a
political
headache
for
trump
before
november
congressional
elections
by
offsetting
republican
claims
that
his
tax
cuts
and
rollbacks
of
federal
regulations
have
helped
to
boost
the
economy
iran
opec
s
producer
behind
saudi
arabia
and
iraq
has
pledged
to
block
any
supply
increases
tehran
says
the
price
rally
was
instigated
by
trump
himself
when
he
decided
to
put
additional
sanctions
on
iranian
oil
sales
it
has
also
accused
saudi
arabia
of
discrediting
opec
by
following
instructions
from
the
united
states
which
is
not
part
of
the
group
iran
s
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
does
not
plan
to
attend
the
meeting
in
algiers
all
opec
production
policy
decisions
must
in
theory
gain
percent
approval
from
its
members
