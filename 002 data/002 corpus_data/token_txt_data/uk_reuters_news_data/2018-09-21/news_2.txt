keystone xl pipeline route would not harm environment -u.s. state dept
washington
reuters
the
state
department
on
friday
issued
an
environmental
assessment
of
a
revised
route
for
the
keystone
xl
crude
pipeline
that
concluded
it
would
not
harm
water
or
wildlife
clearing
a
hurdle
for
the
project
that
has
been
pending
for
a
decade
even
if
the
pipeline
spilled
crude
oil
along
its
revised
route
through
nebraska
a
top
concern
of
environmentalists
there
would
likely
be
no
impact
to
groundwater
the
nearly
draft
review
said
prompt
cleanup
response
would
likely
be
capable
of
remediating
the
contaminated
soils
before
the
hazardous
release
reaches
groundwater
depth
the
review
said
last
month
a
federal
judge
in
montana
had
ordered
the
state
department
to
conduct
the
review
of
a
revised
route
of
the
project
to
take
into
account
new
information
relevant
to
a
permit
it
issued
for
the
pipeline
last
year
the
review
also
said
implementing
the
revised
route
would
have
no
significant
direct
indirect
or
cumulative
effects
on
the
quality
of
the
natural
or
human
president
donald
trump
is
eager
to
see
the
building
of
the
pipeline
which
was
axed
by
former
president
barack
obama
in
on
environmental
concerns
relating
to
emissions
that
cause
climate
change
the
project
has
galvanized
environmentalists
tribal
groups
and
ranchers
in
opposition
to
the
billion
mile
km
pipeline
that
would
carry
heavy
crude
from
canada
s
oil
sands
in
alberta
to
steele
city
nebraska
from
there
the
crude
would
be
sent
to
refineries
and
potentially
for
export
canadian
oil
producers
who
face
discounts
for
their
crude
due
to
transport
bottlenecks
refineries
and
pipeline
builders
support
the
project
transcanada
corp
plans
to
start
construction
in
spokesman
matthew
john
said
the
company
s
chief
executive
russ
girling
said
last
month
that
it
could
make
a
final
investment
decision
on
the
project
late
this
year
or
in
early
pending
some
regulatory
approvals
and
court
challenges
robert
kwan
an
rbc
analyst
said
the
draft
review
was
a
positive
step
for
keystone
xl
environmentalists
said
the
review
was
an
example
of
the
trump
administration
trying
to
push
through
a
project
that
would
risk
harming
water
resources
and
increase
dependence
on
crude
we
ve
held
off
construction
of
this
pipeline
for
years
and
regardless
of
this
administration
s
attempts
to
force
this
dirty
tar
sands
pipeline
on
the
american
people
that
fight
will
continue
until
keystone
xl
is
stopped
once
and
for
all
