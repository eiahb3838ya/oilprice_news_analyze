energy
companies
cut
oil
rigs
for
a
second
week
in
three
as
new
drilling
has
stalled
in
the
nation
s
largest
oil
field
where
production
was
forecast
to
grow
at
the
slowest
pace
in
nearly
two
years
due

constraints
drillers
cut
one

in

said
in
its
closely
followed
report
on
friday
the
rig
count
an
early
indicator
of
future
output
is
still
much
higher
than
a
year
ago
when
rigs
were
active
as
energy
companies
have
been
ramping
up
production
in
anticipation
of
higher
prices
in
than
previous
years
but
since
june
the
rig
count
has
held
mostly
steady
at
above
rigs
as
crude
prices
in
the
permian
region
in
western
texas
and
eastern
new
mexico
have
collapsed
due
to
a
lack
of
pipeline
infrastructure
needed
to
tranport
more
fuel
out
of
the
region
the
permian
is
the
biggest
shale
oil
formation
in
the
united
states
oil
production
in
the
permian
will
rise
barrels
per
day
its
slowest
growth
since
late
the
energy
information
administration
said
this
week
meanwhile
the
number
of
wells

wells
not
connected
to
a
pipeline
in
the
permian
will
rise
by
to
the
largest
monthly
increase
since
the
eia
began
tracking
the
data
in
september
this
week
crude
futures
were
up
percent
to
about
per
barrel
putting
the
contract
on
track
to
rise
for
a
second
week
in
a
row
in
volatile
trade
ahead
of
an
opec
meeting
on
sunday
so
far
this
year
oil
futures
have
averaged
per
barrel
that
compares
with
averages
of
in
calendar
and
in
looking
ahead
crude
futures
were
trading
at
nearly
for
the

this

forecast
the
average
combined
oil

gas
rig
count
would
rise
from
in
to
in
in
and
in
since
oil
and
gas
rigs
were
already
in
service
drillers
would
only
have
to
add
a
handful
of
rigs
during
the
rest
of
the
year
to
hit
simmons
forecast
for
so
far
this
year
the
total
number
of
oil
and
gas
rigs
active
in
the
united
states
has
averaged
that
keeps
the
total
count
for
on
track
to
be
the
highest
since
which
