we
have
been
here
since

for
us
to

in
an

said
maria

prato
as
she
cut
off
one

s
expensive
steak
dinner
at
a
salt
bae
restaurant
in
istanbul
this
month
venezuela
which
has
the
world
s
cheapest
gasoline
has
been
plagued
by
intermittent
fuel
shortages
in
recent
months
as
its
oil
industry
struggles
with
lower
production
and
problematic
refineries
maduro
s
leftist
government
blamed
the
shortages
on
power
cuts
in
nearby
zulia
an
state
that
is
suffering
blackouts
because
power
stations
lack
maintenance
and
spare
parts
government
critics
say
inept
management
of
venezuela
s
oil
industry
home
to
the
world
s
biggest
crude
reserves
is
to
blame
for
the
shortages
tachira
without
gas
thanks
to
failed
communism
tweeted
tachira
opposition
legislator
franklyn
duarte
the
government
this
month
also
rolled
out
a
new
payment
system
in
eight
states
near
the
colombian
border
including
tachira
where
san
cristobal
is
located
in
an
attempt
to
halt
widespread
smuggling
of
venezuela
s
gas
to
colombia
maduro
says
the
payment
system
will
pave
the
way
for
charging
international
prices
for
fuel
a
massive
increase
given
that
gas
is
now
almost
free
as
his
government
seeks
to
shore
up
state
coffers
amid
a
hyperinflationary
economic
meltdown
the
pilot
programme
was
designed
to
provide
service
stations
with
wireless
devices
that
use
a
controversial
identification
document
to
carry
out
transactions
the
document
called
the
fatherland
card
is
meant
to
provide
subsidies
to
motorists
to
help
soften
the
impact
of
the
steep
price
increases
maduro
announced
on
thursday
night
that
the
programme
would
be
rolled
out
in
the
rest
of
venezuela
on
monday
