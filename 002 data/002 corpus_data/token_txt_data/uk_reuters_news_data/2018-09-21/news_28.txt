norway
s
gas
exports
hit
a
new
high
of
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
this
summer
and
the
annual
deliveries
will
be
on
a
par
with
the
record
annual
figure
achieved
in
gas
system
operator
gassco
said
on
friday
between
may
and
august
which
is
normally
a
season
with
fewer
gas
exports
norway
s
deliveries
almost
matched
a
normal
winter
level
as
european
importers
needed
to
refill
depleted
gas
storages
which
drained
during
last
year
s
cold
winter
it
s
too
early
to
say
exactly
where
we
ll
end
up
this
year
but
we
expect
another
good
performance
which
will
be
roughly
on
a
par
with
the
record
gassco
chief
executive
frode
leversund
said
in
a
statement
gassco
transported
bcm
through
pipeline
systems
from
norway
to
continental
europe
and
britain
during
this
was
the
highest
volume
sold
in
years
of
norwegian
gas
exports
exports
to
germany
via
the
emden
terminal
which
became
operational
in
made
a
strong
contribution
to
this
summer
s
record
deliveries
gassco
added
not
only
has
norway
s
continental
shelf
delivered
larger
volumes
than
before
but
the
transport
system
has
also
handled
these
increased
quantities
well
said
leversund
later
this
year
norway
will
open
its
new
polarled
pipeline
to
carry
more
gas
from
its
aasta
hansteen
field
in
the
norwegian
sea
said
gassco
as
operator
of
both
polarled
and
nyhamna
we
expect
great
interest
in
this
region
from
a
number
of
players
our
strong
summer
deliveries
strengthen
that
belief
it
said
aasta
hansteen
is
expected
to
start
sending
gas
to
gassco

nyhamna
processing
plant
from
