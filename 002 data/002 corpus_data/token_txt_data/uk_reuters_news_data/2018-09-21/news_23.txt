china
may
issue
an
additional
million
to
million
tonnes
of
permits
for
refined
fuel
exports
for
to
prevent
refiners
from
having
to
slash
throughput
rates
according
to
three
sources
briefed
on
the
matter
the
government
has
been
looking
to
keep
fuel
export
quotas
at
around
million
tonnes
this
year
steady
with
levels
to
maintain
overall
trade
balances
but
the
state
refiners
have
been
using
the
quotas
already
granted
for
this
year
faster
than
expected
rushing
to
ship
more
gasoline
diesel
and
jet
kerosene
overseas
in
the
first
nine
months
compared
to
the
same
period
of
because
domestic
refinery
production
has
expanded
faster
than
demand
while
exports
may
not
be
as
lucrative
as
sales
in
the
domestic
market
where
margins
are
largely
guaranteed
the
overseas
shipments
helped
bolster
margins
at
home
by
thinning
local
fuel
supplies
refiners
including
sinopec
corp
petrochina
cnooc
and
sinochem
will
have
already
used
about
million
tonnes
or
percent
of
the
total
grants
so
far
by
according
to
a
state
oil
executive
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
situation
the
big
oil
firms
are
trying
this
week
to
persuade
the
government
to
release
more
quotas
or
they
may
be
forced
to
cut
runs
in
the
fourth
quarter
as
the
remainder
is
far
from
enough
said
the
executive
most
refiners
would
try
to
avoid
reducing
runs
in
the
fourth
quarter
when
diesel
fuel
demand
typically
picks
up
with
an
increase
in
construction
activities
and
the
lifting
of
a
summer
fishing
ban
and
the
golden
week
holiday
of
early
october
which
lifts
gasoline
and
jet
fuel
consumption
the
three
sources
at
state
oil
firms
estimated
the
government
could
issue
an
additional
million
to
million
tonnes
of
fuel
export
quotas
as
early
as
next
week
the
sources
declined
to
be
named
as
the
discussions
are
not
public
representatives
of
cnpc
sinopec
cnooc
and
sinochem
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
the
national
development
reform
commission
ndrc
and
ministry
of
commerce
also
did
not
respond
to
queries
chinese
customs
data
showed
huge
gains
in
transportation
fuel
exports
this
year
gasoline
exports
in
the
first
seven
months
grew
percent
over
the
same
period
last
year
to
million
tonnes
diesel
rose
percent
to
million
tonnes
and
jet
kerosene
gained
percent
to
million
tonnes
refiners
earned
bumper
profits
this
year
as
diesel
demand
firmed
while
many
small
fuel
blenders
were
forced
out
of
business
and
some
independent
oil
processors
slashed
output
over
the
summer
months
because
of
stricter
government
tax
scrutiny
enacted
from
march
