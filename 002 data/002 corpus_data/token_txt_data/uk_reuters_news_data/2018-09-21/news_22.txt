he
had
been
a
strong
proponent
of
expanding
the
region

but
his
advocacy
for
the
polluting

was
tempered
in
favour
of
promoting
cleaner
projects
after
he
came
to
beijing
he
is
one
of
the
few
uighurs
a
muslim
people
who
speak
a
turkic
language
and
who
call
xinjiang
home
ever

and
made
it
to
a
top
job
in

chinese
in
recent

nur
bekri
was
xinjiang
s
governor
from
until
a
time
that
saw
bouts
of
ethnic
violence
that
included
deadly
rioting
in
the
region
s
capital
urumqi
in
during
his
time
in
that
position
which
ranks
below
the
communist
party

nur
bekri
was
a
proponent
of
restrictions
placed
on
religious
practices
of
the
largely
muslim
ethnic
minorities
there
ostensibly
to
curb
what
the
government
said
was
the
spread
of
extremist
ideology
he
said
in
the
wake
of
the
riots
the
government
s
religious
policies
completely
accorded
with
the
interests
of
the
people
nur
bekri
had
also
touted
bilingual
education
for
uighurs
in
schools
as
a
route
to
economic
opportunity
although
critics
said
in
reality
that
meant
marginalising
the
uighurs

language
and
culture
in
favour

said
in
an
emailed
statement
that
despite
actively
promoting
beijing
s
policies
nur
bekri
had
not
been
trusted
by
beijing
and
was
seen
as
scum
by

i
hope
that

problems
will
awaken
those

will
not
be

uighurs
