u.s. equities dominate as investors pile back into risk and laggards bounce back
london
investors
returned
to
equities
in
droves
this
week
as
they
became
convinced
higher
trade
tariffs
would
cause
only
limited
damage
to
the
global
economy
while
greater
risk
appetite
helped
this
year
s
laggards
rebound
sharply
a
net
billion
flowed
into
equity
funds
as
investors
ploughed
money
back
into
risky
assets
having
pulled
billion
from
world
equity
funds
last
week
bank

america
strategists
said
citing
data
from
epfr
funds
etfs
drew
in
more
than
that
total
with
billion
inflows
while
mutual
funds
suffered
billion
outflows
indicating
the
resurgence
in
risk
appetite
was
partly
driven
by
retail
investors
stocks
again
pulled
in
the
lion
s
share
of
inflows
with
some
billion
added
to
the
region
s
equity
funds
this
included
billion
into
large
caps
and
billion
into
small
caps
all
the
losers
of
so
far
bounced
back
strongly
this
week
as
the
dollar
weakened
euro
zone
stocks
emerging
markets
banks
and
industrial
metals
all
had
a
stellar
week
after
being
sold
sharply
most
of
the
year
the
euro
zone
leading
stocks
index
was
on
track
for
its
straight
day
of
gains
on
friday
its
longest
winning
streak
since
but
the
turnaround
in
performance
still
was
not
enough
to
coax
investors
back
into
europe
which
suffered
further
outflows
of
billion
making
it
of
the
past
weeks
the
region
s
equity
funds
lost
money
em
equities
saw
modest
outflows
of
billion
while
emerging
market
debt
on
the
other
hand
had
its
biggest
inflows
in
eight
weeks
with
billion
coming
into
the
sector
tech
was
once
again
the
most
popular
sector
drawing
in
billion
while
investors
growing
interest
in
defensive
positioning
was
clear
with
billion
going
into
healthcare
stocks
baml
s
bull
and
bear
index
of
investor
sentiment
held
at
still
closer
to
fear
than
greed
strategists
said
with
rate
rises
this
year
global
central
bank
hiking
is
proceeding
at
its
fastest
since
baml
strategists
said
rising
rates
will
start
to
turn
the
screws
on
markets
as
higher
corporate
debt
levels
increase
defaults
and
credit
spreads
they
said
citing
data
from
the
bis
and
iif
they
noted
corporate
debt
has
risen
percent
since
and
government
debt
has
risen
percent
corporates
not
consumers
or
banks
will
cause
next
recession
baml
predicted
corporates
are
also
the
largest
buyers
of
equities
they
highlighted
with
trillion
of
stock
buybacks
easily
surpassing
the
fed
s
asset
purchases
of
trillion
since
lehman
s
collapse
the
strategists
also
noted
that
banks
which
typically
benefit
from
higher
rates
have
recently
failed
to
rise
along
with
treasury
yields
returns
will
stay
low
and
volatile
and
assets
with
strong
cash
flows
would
outperform
those
with
weak
balance
sheets
they
forecast
in
one
more
encouraging
observation
baml
noted
what
they
called
a
watershed
data
point
in
japanese
land
prices
rising
percent
this
year
their
first
price
increase
since
and
a
positive
for
japanese
lenders
japan
s
equity
funds
drew
in
small
inflows
of
billion
