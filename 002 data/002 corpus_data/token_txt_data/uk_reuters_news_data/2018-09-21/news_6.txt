oil
prices
were
up
slightly
in
heavy
seesaw
trading
on
friday
giving
back
most
earlier
gains
after
news
that
major
producers
would
consider
additional
supply
a
day
after
president
donald
trump
again
blasted
the
cartel
investors
grappled
with
whether
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
producers
will
offset
a
shortfall
from
iran
once
sanctions
go
into
full
force
major
producers
are
scheduled
to
gather
in
algeria
on
sunday
the
question
is
just
how
much
oil
is
going
to
be
taken
off
the
market
with
sanctions
on
iran

director

compounding
declining
production
in
venezuela
iran
s
production
cuts
could
lead
to
a
much
tighter
supply
picture
he
said
i
think
that
the
market
is
building
up
energy
for
another
try
at
multiyear
global
benchmark

a
source
told
reuters
that
opec
and
its
allies
were
discussing
the
possibility
of
raising
output
by
barrels
per
day
then
prices
rebounded
as
investors
bet
iran
s
production
cuts
would
be
too
great
to
be
fully
offset
the
market
again
reversed
course
with
traders
citing
worries
crude
would
come
under
pressure
in
the
fourth
quarter
as

build
after

for
middle
eastern
countries
to
oil
prices
and
again
urged
opec
to
lower
prices
his
tweet
the
coming
opec
meeting
and
concerns
over
looming
sanctions
on
iran
made
for
jittery
trading
on
friday
prices
jumped
early
after
a
report
said
opec
and
producers
pumped
less
oil
in
august
than
july
due
to
a
drop
in
iranian
supply
iranian
crude
exports
are
coming
down
earlier
and
bigger
than
expected
at
a
time
seasonal
demand
is
strong
with
spare
capacity
also
falling
sharply
the
market
remains
exposed
to
price
shocks
anz
bank
analysts
said
in
a
note
to
clients

piled
into
the
trade
betting
opec
can
not
compensate
fully
for
the
loss
of
oil
from
its
no
producer
iran
traders

fretted
that
sanctions
could
prompt
iran
to
try
to

of

and

opec
may
increase

by

quickly
quelled
those
concerns
jason
gammel
analyst
at
bank
jefferies
said
he
expects
saudi
arabia
to
try
to
keep
the
market
well
supplied
into
but
at
the
cost
of
spare
capacity
which
he
said
could
fall
below
