russian
mining
firm

nickel
said
on
tuesday
rising
use
of
batteries
in
electric
vehicles
would
create
strong
demand
for
nickel
from
the
nornickel
which
vies
with
brazil
s
vale
sa
to
be
the
world
s
biggest
nickel
producer
said
the
battery
industry
would
use
more
than
tonnes
a
year
of
the
metal
by
it
said
this
equals
almost
half
of
the
current
consumption
of
class
nickel
referring
to
the
highest
quality
nickel
that
is
now
mainly
used
as
an
ingredient
to
produce
stainless
steel
nornickel
which
is
well
positioned
to
benefit
from
the
rise
in
electric
vehicles
as
it
mines
cobalt
which
is
also
used
in
battery
production
sold
tonnes
of
nickel
in
it
sold
tonnes
of
cobalt
in
down
from
tonnes
in
citing
a
problem
with
its
quality
that
nornickel
said
had
been
fixed
it
said
it
would
work
to
reduce
its
cobalt
stockpile
soon
the
forthcoming
shift
in
favour
of
more
technologies
in
battery
cathode
material
alongside
the
growing
share
of
electric
vehicles
should
drive
up
strongly
the
demand
for
class
nickel
products
towards
it
said
it
made
the
comments
in
its
financial
statement
for
in
which
the
firm
reported
percent
growth
in
its
core
earnings
in
thanks
to
higher
prices
for
its
metals
its
shares
dipped
percent
in
line
with
the
broader
micex
index
as
investors
remained
focussed
on
conflict
between
nornickel
s
biggest
shareholders
russian
businessman
vladimir
potanin
and
aluminium
producer
rusal
the
dispute
partly
revolves
around
whether
the
firm
should
deliver
a
big
dividend
or
focus
on
robust
capital
spending
the
company
said
on
tuesday
its
board
would
issue
a
recommendation
for
its
final
dividend
for
in
april
or
may
the
firm
s
capital
expenditure
is
set
at
billion
and
it
continues
to
consider
several
projects
in
russia
nornickel
is
also
the
world
s
top
producer
of
palladium
which
is
chiefly
used
in
auto
catalysts
the
metal
was
nornickel
s
largest
revenue
generator
in
as
prices
soared
on
fears
of
shortages
the
company
said
it
did
not
see
any
immediate
threat
to
palladium
from
electric
vehicles
forecasting
the
market
deficit
to
widen
to
million
troy
ounces
this
year
nornickel
said
its
earnings
before
interest
taxation
depreciation
and
amortisation
ebitda
of
billion
were
held
back
by
several
factors
including
the
accumulation
of
palladium
stock
to
deliver
under
contracts
nornickel
accumulated
the
stockpile
of
more
than
ounces
of
palladium
at
the
end
of
it
said
adding
that
it
planned
to
sell
the
bulk
of
that
by
the
end
of
june
to
meet
the
rising
demand
from
its
customers
