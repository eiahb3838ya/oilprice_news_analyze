skirting saudi arms sales, france says iran has "lots" of weapons in yemen
paris
reuters
france
s
foreign
minister
on
tuesday
sidestepped
questions
on
whether
his
country
should
end
weapons
sales
to
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
because
they
were
being
used
in
yemen
saying
that
iran
also
had
lots
of
weapons
there
the
kingdom
is
leading
a
coalition
formed
in
to
fight
the
houthi
group
that
controls
most
of
northern
yemen
and
the
capital
sanaa
in
a
war
that
has
killed
more
than
people
and
displaced
more
than
three
million
the
french
administration
under
president
emmanuel
macron
has
drawn
criticism
in
particular
from
rights
groups
over
its
support
of
the
kingdom
s
actions
and
allowing
weapons
it
has
sold
to
riyadh
potentially
to
be
used
in
its
yemen
operations
when
asked
specifically
why
france
continued
to
sell
weapons
to
saudi
and
the
emirates
in
the
current
context
le
drian
skirted
the
issue
and
said
the
priority
was
to
find
a
political
solution
to
the
yemen
crisis
i
m
really
worried
by
the
situation
in
yemen
le
drian
told
parliament
s
foreign
affairs
committee
it
s
an
absurd
war
it
s
true
that
there
are
saudi
weapons
but
would
you
believe
it
there
are
iranian
weapons
too
lots
of
them
iran
has
denied
supplying
the
houthis
weapons
the
two
gulf
arab
states
are
among
france
s
main
weapons
clients
receiving
tanks
armoured
vehicles
munitions
artillery
and
in
the
case
of
the
emirates
fighter
jets
unlike
some
european
states
paris
has
shown
no
concrete
signs
of
reducing
or
suspending
sales
to
the
coalition
despite
warnings
that
some
of
its
weapons
could
be
used
in
the
war
in
yemen
sources
aware
of
the
issue
have
said
however
paris
has
grown
increasingly
concerned
by
the
worsening
humanitarian
situation
and
in
december
macron
called
for
a
complete
lifting
of
a
saudi
blockade
on
yemen
the
problem
is
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
that
commit
their
own
armies
to
an
absurd
conflict
and
we
hope
that
we
will
quickly
start
the
political
solution
because
it
is
probably
the
crisis
in
the
region
that
would
be
easiest
to
resolve
if
there
was
the
political
will
