update 4-u.s. pushes nafta talks pace, warns of political headwinds
mexico
city
reuters
mexican
and
officials
pushed
on
monday
to
speed
up
nafta
negotiations
with
the
united
states
floating
the
idea
of
reaching
an
agreement
in
principle
in
coming
weeks
to
avoid
political
headwinds
later
this
year
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
showing
impatience
at
the
slow
pace
of
the
talks
said
mexico
s
presidential
election
and
the
looming
expiry
of
a
congressional
negotiating
authorization
in
july
put
the
onus
on
the
united
states
mexico
and
canada
to
come
up
with
a
plan
soon
we
probably
have
a
month
or
a
month
and
a
half
or
something
to
get
an
agreement
in
principle
lighthizer
told
reporters
at
the
conclusion
of
a
seventh
round
of
talks
to
overhaul
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
in
mexico
city
he
was
speaking
after
meeting
mexican
economy
minister
ildefonso
guajardo
and
canadian
foreign
minister
chrystia
freeland
for
a
joint
event
marked
by
a
more
cordial
mood
than
in
previous
rounds
despite
major
disagreements
over
president
donald
trump
s
plan
to
impose
steel
tariffs
trump
has
threatened
to
dump
nafta
unless
it
boosts
manufacturing
and
employment
arguing
the
accord
has
caused
the
migration
of
jobs
and
factories
southward
to
mexico
guajardo
told
reporters
the
three
countries
aimed
to
hold
discussions
on
nafta
over
the
next
five
weeks
before
an
eighth
round
probably
in
early
april
during
that
period
he
and
his
two
counterparts
also
aimed
to
meet
to
narrow
differences
on
the
most
complex
issues
in
the
talks
which
include
agreeing
on
new
auto
content
rules
a
mechanism
and
agricultural
market
access
lighthizer
said
time
to
rework
the
deal
was
running
very
short
and
again
raised
the
possibility
of
the
united
states
pursuing
bilateral
deals
with
its
partners
albeit
stressing
that
his
government
would
prefer
a
agreement
he
said
the
united
states
was
making
more
headway
with
its
southern
neighbor
than
with
canada
freeland
declined
to
give
details
on
a
prospective
timeline
for
the
next
round
and
said
alongside
lighthizer
that
trump
s
plan
to
impose
a
percent
tariff
on
steel
imports
and
a
percent
tariff
on
aluminum
imports
was
unacceptable
the
trade
promotion
authority
or
tpa
is
authorized
by
congress
and
is
needed
to
implement
legislation
for
new
trade
agreements
such
as
the
renegotiation
of
nafta
the
tpa
expires
on
july
and
analysts
expect
it
to
be
extended
the
united
states
also
holds
congressional
elections
in
november
early
on
monday
the
president
ratcheted
up
tension
before
the
ministerial
meetings
in
mexico
by
tweeting
that
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminum
will
only
come
off
if
new
fair
nafta
agreement
is
lighthizer
said
that
meant
canada
and
mexico
would
enjoy
tariff
exemptions
once
a
nafta
deal
was
reached
calling
the
tariffs
an
incentive
to
conclude
the
talks
canada
and
mexico
say
they
should
be
exempted
from
such
moves
and
have
warned
they
could
retaliate
guajardo
said
there
would
be
no
concessions
made
in
the
nafta
negotiations
to
placate
trump
on
steel
and
aluminum
while
freeland
said
the
two
issues
were
separate
guajardo
urged
all
sides
however
to
avoid
a
trade
war
and
said
mexico
would
wait
for
a
decision
if
the
united
states
did
impose
tariffs
a
response
should
be
tailored
to
the
sector
in
question
to
avoid
complicating
other
issues
he
added
contaminating
strategies
just
ends
up
making
you
escalate
the
nature
of
the
conflicts
guajardo
said
talks
to
overhaul
the
pact
are
moving
slowly
in
part
because
canada
and
mexico
have
resisted
demands
to
boost
the
north
american
content
of
autos
produced
inside
nafta
when
asked
about
the
discussions
on
the
rules
of
origin
for
autos
guajardo
noted
that
no
trade
deal
could
depend
only
on
the
interests
of
one
particular
sector
although
mexico
holds
its
election
in
july
it
will
not
change
governments
until
december
and
guajardo
pledged
to
keep
negotiating
for
as
as
long
as
necessary
while
president
enrique
pena
nieto
s
administration
is
in
office
lighthizer
said
only
six
chapters
had
been
concluded
since
talks
began
in
august
negotiators
are
working
on
chapters
overall
he
said
including
a
new
one
on
energy
uncertainty
over
the
talks
and
the
potential
for
a
wider
global
trade
war
are
making
investors
nervous
during
the
latest
round
negotiators
concluded
talks
on
rules
governing
food
safety
and
animal
health
good
regulatory
practices
plus
