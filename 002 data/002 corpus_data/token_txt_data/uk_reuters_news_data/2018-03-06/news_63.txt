exports
of
crude
oil
to
asia
appear
to
be
starting
to
struggle
under
the
weight
of
a
narrowing
discount
for
its
domestic
benchmark
crude
to
international
grades
and
efforts
by
other
suppliers
to
maintain
competitiveness
and
port
data
suggest
asian
imports
of
crude
were
equivalent
to
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
february
down
sharply
from
bpd
in
january
march
s
figure
may
be
even
weaker
with
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
oil
research
and
forecasts
pointing
to
asian
imports
of
only
about
bpd
while
these
estimates
are
subject
to
revision
the
march
data
shouldn
t
change
dramatically
given
any
cargo
due
to
be
offloaded
in
asia
this
month
would
have
to
have
left
a
port
by
now
or
at
least
within
the
next
day
or
so
the
main
culprit
for
a
slowdown
in
shipments
to
asia
is
likely
the
narrowing
discount
of
benchmark
west
texas
intermediate
wti
to
brent
the
light
crude
grade
used
as
a
price
marker
for
the
rest
of
the
world
the
discount
of
wti
to
brent
was
a
barrel
at
monday
s
close
slightly
more
than
on
march
which
was
the
smallest
gap
in
seven
months
the
spread
between
the
two
benchmarks
blew
out
to
a
barrel
in
late
september
in
the
aftermath
of
hurricane
harvey
which
knocked
out
refineries
along
the
gulf
coast
cutting
demand
for
wti
crudes
it
remained
relatively
wide
for
several
months
after
that
ending
the
year
at
a
barrel
but
the
differential
has
been
steadily
narrowing
this
year
in
response
to
strong
demand
from
refineries
and
from
overseas
buyers
asian
imports
of
bpd
of
crude
in
november
and
january
s
bpd
were
the
strongest
two
months
on
record
showing
that
the
region
s
traders
were
quick
to
take
advantage
of
the
weakening
of
wti
relative
to
brent
it
s
also
likely
that
the
spread
for
physical
crude
is
actually
narrower
than
that
implied
by
the
futures
contracts
dated
forties
and
oseberg
crude
a
physical
price
for
two
brent
grades
ended
last
week
at
a
barrel
just
above
the
physical
wti
houston
price
of
as
assessed
by
price
reporting
agency
argus
at
this
level
it
doesn
t
make
economic
sense
for
asian
buyers
to
import
crude
from
the
gulf
with
a
discount
of
at
least
a
barrel
needed
to
overcome
the
higher
freight
rates
involved
for
the
longer
sea
journey
tanker
rates
from
the
united
states
to
asia
have
also
been
rising
recently
with
the
cost
of
shipping
a
tonne
of
oil
from
houston
to
china
assessed
by
thomson
reuters
at
on
march
up
from
at
the
start
of
february
and
in
late
september
last
year
another
factor
undermining
crude
exports
to
asia
is
the
likelihood
of
plentiful
cargoes
from
traditional
suppliers
in
the
middle
east
and
africa
several
refineries
in
asia
undertake
routine
maintenance
in
the
second
quarter
which
usually
prompts
both
lower
official
selling
prices
osps
from
middle
eastern
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
as
well
as
sharper
discounts
in
the
physical
markets
saudi
aramco
the
kingdom
s
producer
said
in
a
statement
on
monday
that
it
would
trim
the
osp
for
its
main
arab
light
grade
to
a
premium
of
a
barrel
over
regional
benchmark
crude
for
cargoes
down
from
for
march
shipments
this
matched
the
expectations
of
traders
and
refiners
in
the
region
surveyed
ahead
of
the
release
and
shows
the
saudis
are
still
trying
to
ensure
their
crude
remains
competitive
even
as
they
maintain
a
commitment
to
restrain
output
by
the
terms
of
the
agreement
between
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
allies
including
russia
the
saudi
osp
sets
the
trend
for
official
prices
from
other
producers
in
the
middle
east
such
as
iraq
iran
and
kuwait
overall
it
seems
that
crude
exports
to
asia
are
facing
headwinds
that
will
likely
only
be
alleviated
by
a
of
wti
s
discount
to
brent
that
will
most
likely
require
rising
shale
oil
output
a
levelling
out
of
refinery
demand
and
ongoing
opec
curbs
to
keep
prices
other
than
wti
at
elevated
levels
