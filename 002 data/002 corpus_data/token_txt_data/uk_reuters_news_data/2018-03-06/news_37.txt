the
global
oil
and
gas
industry
needs
to
invest
more
than
trillion
over
the
next
years
to
meet
expected
growth
in
demand
and
compensate
for
the
natural
decline
in
developed
fields
saudi
aramco
chief
executive
officer
amin
nasser
said
on
tuesday
speaking
at
the
ceraweek
conference
in
houston
nasser
said
the
industry
has
already
lost
trillion
of
investments
since
the
oil
price
downturn
from
to
future
investments
needed
will
only
come
if
investors
are
convinced
that
oil
will
be
allowed
to
compete
on
a
level
playing
field
that
oil
is
worth
so
much
more
and
that
oil
is
here
for
the
foreseeable
future
nasser
said
that
is
why
we
must
push
back
on
the
idea
that
the
world
can
do
without
proven
and
reliable
sources
we
must
challenge
mistaken
assumptions
about
the
speed
with
which
alternatives
will
penetrate
he
noted
that
about
percent
of
passenger
vehicles
on
the
road
use
internal
combustion
engines
even
hybrid
vehicles
and
said
electricity
produced
for
vehicles
comes
through
power
generation
which
is
still
dominated
by
coal
particularly
in
markets
like
india
and
china
nasser
said
that
even
with
the
growth
of
electric
vehicles
the
increased
demand
from
petrochemical
markets
over
the
next
two
decades
will
necessitate
additional
investment
and
need
for
crude
oil
he
noted
even
conservative
estimates
suggest
the
need
for
about
million
barrels
per
day
of
new
capacity
in
the
next
five
years
he
said
that
he
was
confident
that
oil
market
fundamentals
and
future
demand
growth
would
be
healthy
despite
significant
oil
price
volatility
and
forecasts
of
rising
shale
oil
production
nasser
only
briefly
referenced
the
plans
for
saudi
aramco
to
go
public
saying
that
it
is
proceeding
very
well
but
that
the
company
s
shareholder
the
saudi
government
will
ultimately
have
to
decide
when
and
where
it
will
be
listed
the
company
is
expected
to
list
the
ipo
domestically
but
there
is
significant
jockeying
between
new
york
london
and
hong
kong
for
a
potential
second
listing
hong
kong
is
emerging
as
an
increasingly
likely
compromise
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
