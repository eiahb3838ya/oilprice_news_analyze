shrinking gas giant engie eyes deals to stem earnings loss
paris
reuters
french
power
utility
engie
is
looking
at
big
acquisitions
that
will
generate
cash
in
a
strategy
switch
following
the
sale
of
billion
euros
of
assets
that
have
shrunk
its
earnings
base
according
to
two
sources
close
to
the
company
between
and
engie
s
revenue
fell
by
a
third
from
billion
euros
billion
to
billion
and
analysts
expect
it
to
have
dropped
further
during
over
the
same
period
core
earnings
have
slumped
from
billion
euros
in
to
a
forecast
billion
euros
at
end
engie
s
stock
has
followed
the
same
pattern
dropping
more
than
percent
from
highs
its
billion
market
value
puts
the
top
european
utility
way
behind
peers
iberdrola
and
enel
worth
billion
and
billion
respectively
new
engie
ceo
isabelle
kocher
appointed
in
may
has
reinvested
part
of
the
proceeds
from
sales
of
fossil
fuel
related
assets
in
a
string
of
smaller
renewable
energy
power
grids
and
energy
services
assets
but
the
acquisitions
have
not
made
up
for
the
lost
earnings
so
far
and
investors
are
hoping
to
get
more
clarity
on
engie
s
strategy
at
the
release
of
earnings
on
thursday
with
the
stock
price
lower
than
when
she
took
charge
kocher
is
cautiously
considering
bigger
deals
in
a
bid
to
restore
earnings
flow
and
regain
investor
confidence
the
sources
said
a
source
close
to
the
board
told
reuters
that
management
is
presenting
potential
major
acquisitions
to
the
board
every
three
months
the
last
such
meeting
took
place
at
the
end
of
selling
the
assets
has
blown
a
hole
in
the
earnings
and
it
is
not
going
to
be
filled
with
renewables
so
kocher
is
on
the
lookout
for
an
acquisition
the
source
said
the
sources
declined
to
name
possible
acquisition
targets
but
bankers
said
dutch
utility
eneco
could
prove
attractive
eneco
s
owners
want
to
pursue
a
private
sale
to
another
industry
player
in
coming
months
reuters
has
reported
engie
declined
to
comment
an
investment
banker
who
has
worked
on
several
deals
for
engie
said
the
arrival
of
solvay
ceo
clamadieu
who
will
take
over
as
chairman
of
engie
s
board
in
may
could
speed
up
the
switch
in
strategy
the
way
engie
is
run
may
change
in
coming
months
engie
has
to
do
something
big
he
said
shortly
after
he
was
nominated
in
february
clamadieu
said
on
french
tv
that
kocher
s
strategy
was
coherent
but
that
engie
needed
to
identify
growth
engines
and
consider
external
growth
a
first
wave
of
asset
sales
in
was
aimed
at
reducing
debt
but
kocher
s
strategy
is
to
sell
and
reinvest
by
late
engie
had
completed
nearly
percent
of
her
divestment
plan
with
the
sale
of
its
upstream
liquefied
natural
gas
assets
for
billion
its
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
production
business
for
billion
and
the
loy
yang
b
power
station
in
australia
for
million
how
engie
has
reinvested
or
will
reinvest
the
proceeds
of
the
sales
and
how
much
cash
is
left
is
less
clear
while
asset
sales
were
big
chunks
counted
in
billions
acquisitions
have
been
mainly
counted
in
millions
like
the
million
euro
for
solar
energy
firm
solairedirect
and
the
million
for
percent
in
dubai
firm
tabreed
last
year
in
may
sources
said
germany
s
rwe
and
engie
had
studied
the
possibility
of
rwe
swapping
its
renewables
and
grids
unit
innogy
in
exchange
for
a
stake
