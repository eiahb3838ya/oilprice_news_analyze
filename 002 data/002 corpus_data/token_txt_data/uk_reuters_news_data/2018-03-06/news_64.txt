jaguar
land
rover
is
waiting
for
more
information
on
trading
conditions
after
brexit
before
it
decides
whether
to
make
electric
cars
in
its
home
market
the
boss
of
britain
s
biggest
carmaker
told
reuters
the
automaker
which
makes
just
under
one
in
three
of
britain
s
million
cars
at
three
factories
is
building
its
new
electric
model
in
austria
the
company
is
due
to
decide
this
year
whether
to
build
electric
vehicles
in
britain
but
like
its
peers
is
worried
about
the
imposition
of
tariffs
or
customs
checks
after
brexit
snarling
up
supply
chains
and
adding
costs
to
production
that
makes
the
decision
this
year
very
very
critical
and
i
don
t
know
whether
we
can
make
it
chief
executive
ralf
speth
told
reuters
at
the
geneva
motor
show
london
and
brussels
hope
to
agree
on
a
transitional
deal
this
month
to
maintain
free
and
unfettered
trade
until
at
least
the
end
of
ahead
of
a
brexit
agreement
to
be
decided
by
the
end
of
the
year
speth
cited
the
need
for
support
from
government
and
academia
but
when
asked
whether
brexit
was
a
factor
in
the
process
he
said
we
are
waiting
for
these
kinds
of
decisions
it
goes
without
saying
because
uncertainty
is
really
challenging
us
very
much
and
not
only
us
it
s
for
the
complete
industry
you
hardly
see
inward
investment
any
more
or
every
decision
is
taking
longer
from
every
faculty
therefore
it
would
be
appropriate
to
get
more
information
about
these
kinds
