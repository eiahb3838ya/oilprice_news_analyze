euros
billion
pounds
this
year
a
billion
euros
less
than
in
the
recent
uptick
in
oil
prices
has
not
yet
prompted
oil
service
company
clients
to
speed
up
investments
despite
a
few
timid
signs
of
recovery
in
some
segments
it
said
most
oil
companies
are
keeping
their
budgets
flat

if
not
lower
chief
executive
stefano
cao
told
analysts
after
the
company
reported
an
percent
drop
in
adjusted
net
profit
for
production
cuts
by
opec
have
helped
crude
prices
but
recovery
for
oil
contractors
is
expected
to
be
patchy
with
those
finding
it
tougher
to
cut
capacity
and
costs
lagging
others
with
more
flexible
business
models
the
company
s
outlook
for
the
year
is
below
expectations
and
that
could
potentially
lead
to
consensus
for
coming
down
said
alessandro
pozzi
oil
analyst
at
mediobanca
saipem
a
market
leader
in
subsea
engineering
and
construction
e
c
is
looking
to
develop
new
lines
of
business
to
boost
order
books
including
floating
wind
power
farms
and
dismantling
oil
and
gas
platforms
especially
in
the
north
sea
the
company
present
in
around
countries
is
looking
to
expand
its
footprint
in
latin
america
and
is
keen
to
catch
opportunities
in
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
cao
said
he
was
particularly
keen
to
restore
business
in
algeria
after
reaching
a
deal
last
month
with
state
energy
firm
sonatrach
to
end
a
legal
dispute
that
had
left
it
on
a
blacklist
for
new
orders
saipem
is
now
in
a
position
to
access
a
vital
market
for
our
business
he
said
asked
about
alliances
and
cao
said
the
company
was
ready
to
look
at
opportunities
if
they
came
along
including
assessment
of
its
cooperation
agreement
with
aker
solutions
to
develop
subsea
oil
and
gas
projects
we
need
to
decide
whether
to
do
something
more
structural
with
aker
he
said
adjusted
net
profit
last
year
fell
to
million
euros
far
below
company
guidance
of
around
million
euros
the
adjustment
strips
out
writedowns
and
restructuring
and
tax
charges
which
resulted
in
a
reported
net
loss
of
million
euros
for
the
full
year
analysts
however
pointed
to
a
good
downward
trend
in
debt
which
is
seen
at
about
billion
euros
at
the
end
of
this
year
from
billion
euros
at
