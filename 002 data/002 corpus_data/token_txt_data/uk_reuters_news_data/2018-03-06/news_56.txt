update 1-a hard sell? saudi crown prince goes west to woo allies
reuters
saudi
arabia
s
crown
prince
wants
to
persuade
his
british
and
allies
that
shock
reforms
have
made
his
country
a
better
place
to
invest
and
a
more
tolerant
society
on
his
first
foreign
tour
as
heir
apparent
but
it
could
be
a
tough
sell
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
who
starts
talks
in
london
on
wednesday
has
won
western
plaudits
for
seeking
to
reduce
saudi
arabia
s
reliance
on
oil
tackle
chronic
corruption
and
transform
the
deeply
conservative
mainly
sunni
muslim
kingdom
but
the
severity
and
secrecy
of
an
crackdown
last
november
after
prince
mohammed
ousted
an
older
cousin
as
crown
prince
in
a
palace
coup
last
june
has
unnerved
some
investors
though
london
and
new
york
are
rivals
to
host
the
partial
public
listing
of
state
oil
firm
saudi
aramco
the
enthusiasm
of
some
western
business
leaders
even
for
such
an
important
contract
has
been
sapped
by
concerns
about
human
rights
and
a
lack
of
limitations
on
executive
power
in
saudi
arabia
investors
are
intrigued
by
mbs
s
prince
mohammed
s
reform
projects
and
there
will
be
a
huge
amount
of
interest
in
hearing
his
views
but
uncertainty
lingers
said
jane
kinninmont
a
middle
east
expert
at
chatham
house
think
tank
rachel
reeves
head
of
an
influential
business
committee
in
british
parliament
warned
against
risking
london
s
reputation
as
a
finance
centre
by
watering
down
corporate
governance
rules
to
secure
the
aramco
listing
this
she
said
could
ultimately
damage
our
attractiveness
to
foreign
prince
mohammed
has
defended
last
november
s
crackdown
in
which
dozens
of
top
business
leaders
and
princes
were
detained
as
necessary
to
combat
the
cancer
of
corruption
most
detainees
have
now
been
released
and
the
authorities
say
they
have
arranged
to
seize
more
than
billion
in
assets
the
ambitious
young
prince
just
is
sure
to
repeat
his
message
at
talks
in
britain
with
prime
minister
theresa
may
and
when
he
meets
president
donald
trump
during
a
visit
to
the
united
states
starting
on
march
he
will
also
have
a
rare
audience
with
queen
elizabeth
and
dinner
with
prince
charles
the
heir
to
the
throne
in
britain
after
arriving
from
egypt
any
visit
to
the
london
stock
exchange
and
later
the
new
york
stock
exchange
will
be
watched
closely
by
investors
because
of
the
potentially
lucrative
aramco
listing
expected
later
this
year
london
and
new
york
have
long
been
the
frontrunners
to
host
the
international
leg
of
the
flotation
alongside
a
riyadh
listing
but
hong
kong
is
emerging
as
an
increasingly
likely
compromise
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
talks
with
faith
leaders
in
britain
including
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
the
senior
bishop
and
principal
leader
of
the
church
of
england
offer
prince
mohammed
an
opportunity
to
project
a
more
tolerant
image
of
saudi
arabia
sources
close
to
the
trip
told
reuters
under
the
reforms
closely
associated
with
the
crown
prince
social
restrictions
have
been
loosened
such
as
bans
on
cinemas
and
women
driving
he
has
promised
to
promote
a
more
moderate
form
of
islam
business
deals
are
possible
with
british
defence
group
bae
systems
and
european
weapons
maker
mbda
and
initial
agreements
could
be
concluded
on
gas
exploration
petrochemicals
and
industry
according
to
british
and
saudi
sources
they
gave
no
details
of
the
potential
deals
saudi
foreign
minister
adel
said
on
monday
that
britain
s
planned
exit
from
the
european
union
did
not
reduce
its
attractiveness
as
an
investment
destination
adding
we
think
that
britain
is
one
of
the
great
british
foreign
minister
boris
johnson
lauded
security
ties
with
one
of
britain
s
oldest
friends
in
the
region
in
a
newspaper
article
last
week
and
praised
prince
mohammed
s
reforms
but
rights
groups
and
opposition
members
of
parliament
have
criticised
london
s
support
for
the
prince
particularly
over
the
licensing
of
billion
pounds
billion
worth
of
arms
sales
to
saudi
arabia
since
the
start
of
the
yemen
conflict
and
human
rights
groups
plan
a
protest
outside
may
s
downing
street
office
on
wednesday
theresa
may
should
use
this
visit
to
announce
the
uk
will
no
longer
supply
arms
to
saudi
arabia
while
the
devastating
bombing
of
yemen
continues
and
make
clear
britain
s
strong
opposition
to
widespread
human
and
civil
rights
abuses
in
saudi
arabia
opposition
labour
party
leader
jeremy
corbyn
said
prince
mohammed
will
hold
talks
with
trump
before
going
to
new
york
boston
houston
and
san
francisco
for
meetings
with
industry
leaders
as
he
seeks
to
shore
up
investments
and
political
support
from
riyadh
s
closest
western
ally
several
dozen
saudi
chief
executives
will
join
him
in
touting
investment
opportunities
in
the
kingdom
particularly
in
the
areas
of
technology
entertainment
and
tourism
a
washington
source
said
talks
will
also
include
a
bid
to
build
two
nuclear
reactors
in
saudi
arabia
and
a
civilian
nuclear
cooperation
agreement
needed
for
that
to
proceed
an
industry
source
said
riyadh
wants
to
diversify
its
energy
supply
mix
enabling
it
to
export
more
crude
oil
rather
than
burning
it
to
generate
electricity
but
it
has
previously
refused
to
sign
up
to
any
agreement
that
would
deprive
it
of
the
possibility
of
one
day
enriching
uranium
the
political
agenda
in
washington
will
feature
a
new
push
to
end
the
dispute
between
arab
allies
of
the
united
states
that
has
isolated
qatar
over
alleged
ties
to
terrorism
a
senior
official
has
said
the
crown
prince
is
also
likely
to
reiterate
to
washington
and
london
the
view
of
saudi
arabia
that
its
regional
rival
iran
should
not
be
trusted
over
its
nuclear
programme
under
a
deal
reached
with
major
powers
tehran
agreed
to
curbs
on
its
nuclear
programme
in
exchange
for
a
lifting
on
economic
sanctions
