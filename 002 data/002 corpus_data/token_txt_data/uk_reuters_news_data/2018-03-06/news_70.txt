biggest
crude
palm

looking
to
new
markets
as
traditional
customers
india
and
europe
take
steps
to
curb
purchases
the

s
chief
executive
said
on

the
malaysian

planning

palm

refineries
in
myanmar
the
philippines
and
cambodia
in
the

zakaria
arshad
told
reuters
in
an
interview
we
want
to
spread
our
sales
to
various
countries
looking
at
new
markets
which
are
looking
for
additional
crude
palm
oil
and
olein
supply
he
said
peanut
oil
supplies
have
not
been
able
to
keep
pace
with
growing
demand
in
myanmar
zakaria
said
meaning
there
is
scope
to
boost
palm
oil
sales
there
the
philippines
which
traditionally
uses
coconut
oil
is
facing
tight
supplies
of
the
product
as
coconut
water
becomes
popular
with
some
consumers
there
is
also
scope
to
meet
growing
demand
in
pakistan
where
we
have
a
refinery
zakaria
said
on
the
sidelines
of
an
industry
event
in
kuala
lumpur
the
european
union
in
approved
draft
measures
to
reform
its
power
market
and
reduce
energy
consumption
to
meet
more
ambitious
climate
goals
the
draft
includes
banning
the
usage
of
palm
oil
in
motor
fuels
from
india
the
world
s
biggest
edible
oil
importer
last
week
raised
import
tax
on
crude
and
refined
palm
oil
to
the
highest
level
in
more
than
a
decade
in
a
move
designed
to
support
local
farmers
india
has
to
import
they
have
supply
limitations
sooner
or
later
they
have
to
import
palm
oil
this
is
only
temporary
zakaria
said
fgv
s
production
of
fresh
fruit
bunches
of
palm
oil
are
expected
to
rise
percent
in
from
a
year
ago
zakaria
added
we
are
looking
at
a
much
better
crop
this
year
he
said
we
have
new
areas
that
are
starting
production
and
we
have
sorted
out
other
issues
such
as
labour
shortages
and
the
weather
has
two
thirds
of
palm
oil
produced
at
fgv
comes
from
farmers
across
malaysia
