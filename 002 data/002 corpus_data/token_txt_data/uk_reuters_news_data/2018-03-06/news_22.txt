the
dollar
dropped
to
a
low
on
tuesday
as
traders
bet
on
riskier
currencies
on
news
north
and
south
korea
would
hold
their
first
summit
in
more
than
a
decade
and
after
the
south
said
the
north
was
willing
to
discuss
denuclearization
with
the
united
states
north
and
south
korea
still
technically
at
war
since
but
with
tensions
having
eased
since
the
winter
olympics
hosted
by
the
south
last
month
will
hold
their
first
summit
in
more
than
a
decade
next
month
south
korea
said
on
tuesday
it
added
that
the
north
would
suspend
nuclear
tests
while
proposed
talks
with
the
united
states
on
denuclearization
were
underway
the
impact
of
the
news
on
stock
markets
was
clouded
by
concern
over
a
possible
trade
war
triggered
by
tariffs
on
imports
of
steel
and
aluminum
proposed
last
week
by
president
donald
trump
but
republican
lawmakers
stepped
up
calls
for
trump
to
pull
back
from
those
tariffs
as
key
trading
partner
mexico
rejected
a
bid
by
washington
to
drive
a
wedge
between
it
and
canada
in
talks
to
renegotiate
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
the
dollar
seen
as
a
safe
haven
against
risk
in
recent
months
fell
further
after
news
of
the
north
and
south
korea
talks
as
investors
bought
the
australian
and
new
zealand
dollars
and
some
emerging
market
currencies
it
s
too
early
to
wholeheartedly
buy
these
currencies
because
of
the
chances
of
escalating
trade
tension
between
and
its
trading
partners
said
omer
esiner
chief
market
analyst
at
commonwealth
foreign
exchange
in
washington
the
dollar
index
which
tracks
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
other
major
currencies
fell
percent
with
the
euro
up
percent
to
the
dollar
index
touched
its
lowest
since
the
japanese
yen
weakened
percent
versus
the
greenback
to
per
dollar
while
sterling
was
at
up
percent
on
the
day
traders
await
clues
on
monetary
policy
direction
after
european
central
bank
and
bank
of
japan
meet
on
thursday
and
friday
the
strength
of
the
euro
is
starting
to
put
pressure
on

stocks
edged
higher
in
europe
and
rose
slightly
in
the
united
states
while
a
global
gauge
of
major
equity
markets
was
boosted
largely
by
gains
in
asia
after
stocks
were
battered
monday
on
concerns
over
a
global
trade
war
those
worries
eased
during

the

p
for
a
third
straight
session
though
it
was
unclear
what
trump
s
final
decision
on
tariffs
would
be
the
market
is
basically
grasping
for
straws
around
what
the
tariff
policy
is
going
to
be
based
on
the
action
we
saw
today
it
s
hoping
it
doesn
t
turn
into
a
trade
war
