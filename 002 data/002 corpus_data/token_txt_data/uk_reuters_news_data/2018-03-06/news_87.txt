trump's tariff threat may be timed for pennsylvania u.s. house race
washington
march
reuters
president
donald
trump
has
alarmed
the
republican
establishment
and
world
leaders
by
threatening
tough
steel
tariffs
a
message
that
might
be
meant
not
just
to
shake
the
world
trade
order
but
to
help
defend
a
congressional
seat
in
pennsylvania
some
republican
strategists
said
trump
s
tariff
threat
appeared
to
be
timed
at
least
in
part
to
sway
voters
in
the
steel
country
of
pennsylvania
including
its
district
where
republican
rick
saccone
and
democrat
conor
lamb
are
facing
off
in
a
special
election
on
march
the
two
will
vie
to
replace
republican
tim
murphy
who
resigned
in
october
in
a
sex
scandal
if
saccone
loses
it
would
be
a
blow
to
trump
the
first
loss
by
republicans
of
a
seat
in
the
house
of
representatives
since
he
took
office
in
january
the
results
will
not
affect
republican
control
of
the
chamber
trump
has
endorsed
saccone
and
is
scheduled
to
visit
the
pittsburgh
area
on
saturday
for
a
campaign
event
saccone
met
trump
on
arrival
for
a
similar
event
in
january
republican
strategist
ford
o
connell
said
trump
s
stance
on
steel
and
aluminum
tariffs
could
help
republicans
not
only
in
southwestern
pennsylvania
but
across
the
industrial
midwest
the
timing
definitely
helps
saccone
o
connell
said
the
district
covers
steel
farm
and
coal
country
on
the
west
virginia
border
as
well
as
pittsburgh
suburbs
trump
won
the
district
by
nearly
points
in
the
november
presidential
election
helping
him
carry
the
pivotal
battleground
state
but
in
recent
political
races
in
other
states
democrats
upset
by
trump
policies
have
been
energized
to
turn
out
to
vote
in
the
pennsylvania
race
lamb
is
rising
in
the
polls
and
is
neck
and
neck
with
saccone
who
has
said
i
was
trump
before
trump
was
peter
navarro
the
white
house
trade
and
manufacturing
policy
director
defended
trump
s
trade
plan
on
fox
business
network
s
varney
show
on
monday
of
course
if
you
go
to
ohio
or
pennsylvania
or
you
go
to
the
heartland
of
american
main
street
there
s
universal
support
he
said
trump
threatened
to
impose
percent
steel
and
percent
aluminum
tariffs
in
an
announcement
on
thursday
prompting
a
steep
stock
and
expressions
of
concern
about
a
possible
trade
war
from
washington
to
foreign
capitals
establishment
republicans
should
not
be
surprised
that
trump
is
following
through
on
his
campaign
pledge
said
chris
barron
a
republican
strategist
if
republicans
are
going
to
hold
on
to
the
majority
in
the
house
they
need
to
hold
on
in
places
like
pennsylvania
this
is
a
winner
he
said
adding
the
rally
on
saturday
would
be
good
for
trump
who
will
get
positive
feedback
from
the
crowd
it
s
going
to
be
hard
to
talk
the
president
back
from
that
because
he
s
going
to
feel
that
support
from
those
grassroots
voters
barron
said
democrats
said
the
tariff
issue
would
likely
be
a
factor
in
the
district
race
but
one
that
would
cut
two
ways
pennsylvania
democratic
strategist
mike
mikus
said
the
issue
of
steel
tariffs
is
a
very
popular
idea
here
in
western
pennsylvania
however
i
don
t
believe
it
will
be
enough
to
help
rick
saccone
in
this
election
i
don
t
view
it
as
a
because
the
issue
has
been
championed
by
democrats
for
so
republican
strategist
mike
devanney
said
tariff
rhetoric
may
help
saccone
but
that
any
boost
could
be
muted
in
the
diverse
district
he
added
that
the
president
s
comments
could
backfire
it
s
not
without
risks
in
equally
energizing
lamb
s
base
devanney
said
president
trump
is
obviously
a
figure
who
can
energize
and
divide
depending
on
who
