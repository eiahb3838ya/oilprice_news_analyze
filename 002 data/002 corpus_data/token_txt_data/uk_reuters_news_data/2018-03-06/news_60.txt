update 2-diesel collapse gives automakers carbon headache
geneva
reuters
the
accelerating
demise
of
diesel
long
used
by
carmakers
to
boost
is
undermining
their
plans
to
meet
looming
european
union
goals
and
avoid
big
annual
fines
executives
gathered
on
tuesday
at
the
geneva
auto
show
are
grappling
with
unpalatable
choices
existing
vehicles
at
huge
expense
restrict
sales
of
some
profitable
models
or
risk
hundreds
of
millions
of
euros
in
penalties
others
are
clinging
to
the
hope
that
the
image
of
the
latest
euro
diesels
may
yet
be
rehabilitated
and
their
fortunes
restored
i
am
worried
volkswagen
chief
executive
matthias
mueller
said
in
a
reuters
television
interview
but
it
s
our
job
to
solve
these
problems
he
said
i
m
firmly
convinced
that
diesel
will
experience
a
but
a
fresh
flurry
of
bad
headlines
and
the
growing
prospect
of
outright
diesel
vehicle
bans
are
already
sending
their
sales
into
a
steeper
tailspin
while
diesels
produce
more
toxic
nitrogen
oxides
nox
and
particulates
than
gasoline
engines
their
efficiency
has
been
instrumental
in
cutting
greenhouse
gases
as
consumers
shun
diesels
more
carmakers
are
on
track
to
miss
tougher
eu
carbon
dioxide
goals
taking
effect
in
some
industry
insiders
predict
carmakers
will
be
forced
to
rein
in
sales
of
larger
models
by
raising
prices
to
avoid
overshooting
the
eu
s
target
ford
is
reviewing
its
european
in
light
of
diesel
s
slide
and
is
likely
to
restrict
the
sale
of
some
vehicles
that
push
us
over
the
limit
a
company
source
said
steven
armstrong
the
carmaker
s
head
of
european
operations
played
down
that
prospect
we
re
not
having
to
rethink
the
model
he
said
of
course
we
ll
have
to
the
volume
by
powertrain
by
vehicle
but
it
s
not
going
to
be
a
fundamental
shift
for
vw
brand
sales
chief
juergen
stackmann
told
reuters
his
business
would
have
to
consider
price
increases
for
larger
models
restricting
sales
we
are
required
to
be
compliant
with
eu
targets
which
steps
are
necessary
will
become
clear
in
years
a
significantly
lower
mix
of
diesels
is
not
helpful
he
said
initially
sparked
by
vw
s
emissions
scandal
and
subsequent
studies
exposing
the
true
levels
of
nox
emissions
the
diesel
slump
has
since
deepened
rather
than
stabilizing
as
mueller
and
others
had
hoped
it
would
sales
of
diesel
cars
fell
percent
in
europe
last
year
reducing
their
market
share
to
percent
from
a
percent
peak
in
partly
as
a
result
average
emissions
increased
in
europe
in
for
the
first
time
in
a
decade
according
to
researchers
jato
dynamics
that
was
before
the
latest
pr
setbacks
in
which
vw
admitted
using
monkeys
and
humans
to
test
exhaust
gas
and
a
court
ruled
that
german
cities
were
free
to
ban
older
diesel
cars
joining
paris
london
and
a
host
of
other
urban
centers
that
have
vowed
to
run
them
off
the
road
diesel
sales
were
down
another
percent
in
germany
last
month
and
a
whopping
percent
in
britain
amid
concern
that
the
decline
in
values
would
give
way
to
collapse
french
carmakers
which
have
relied
heavily
on
diesels
to
meet
goals
are
now
scrambling
for
alternatives
renault
has
stepped
up
development
of
a
hybrid
known
as
locobox
but
the
powertrain
won
t
even
begin
rolling
out
until
psa
group
chief
executive
carlos
tavares
insisted
last
week
the
peugeot
maker
remained
on
track
in
a
newspaper
interview
the
same
day
however
he
urged
governments
to
suspend
penalties
for
until
electric
car
charging
networks
are
better
developed
tavares
said
on
tuesday
he
would
seek
backing
for
his
demands
from
europe
s
acea
car
industry
lobby
group
which
he
currently
chairs
hybrids
being
rushed
out
across
the
peugeot
citroen
and
newly
acquired
opel
are
not
expected
to
arrive
before
under
current
plans
it
s
not
just
at
psa
that
it
s
happening
too
late
it
s
happening
too
late
everywhere
said
philippe
houchois
a
automotive
analyst
with
investment
bank
jefferies
the
cost
of
compliance
is
one
of
the
potential
triggers
of
the
next
auto
recession
houchois
said
manufacturers
are
going
to
have
to
raise
prices
on
larger
petrol
cars
to
meet
their
emissions
targets
and
that
s
going
to
hit
sales
already
last
october
investment
research
house
msci
was
warning
that
all
carmakers
apart
from
toyota
are
at
risk
of
missing
regulatory
targets
for
fleet
emissions
in
the
japanese
carmaker
is
dropping
diesels
from
its
european
fleet
as
it
benefits
from
two
decades
of
dominance
in
hybrids
fiat
chrysler
is
expected
to
announce
a
diesel
in
its
plan
due
in
june
german
premium
automakers
are
also
better
resourced
to
absorb
the
shock
by
ramping
up
sales
of
hybrids
already
in
their
portfolios
or
pipelines
while
rushing
out
technology
to
curb
emissions
across
existing
model
lineups
including
the
mercedes
but
the
strategy
of
leaning
on
costly
for
compliance
has
limits
as
well
as
profitability
perils
bmw
admits
it
is
already
taking
a
hit
on
the
hybrid
version
of
its
suv
priced
euros
below
the
diesel
version
at
euros
despite
its
higher
cost
the
profitability
of
hybrids
is
below
that
of
cars
with
pure
combustion
engines
a
company
spokesman
said
that
spells
bigger
trouble
for
volume
brands
which
lack
the
lucrative
luxury
models
to
offset
compliance
cars
sold
at
lower
profit
or
even
a
loss
to
meet
goals
if
everybody
wants
to
sell
a
lot
of
electrified
vehicles
the
prices
are
going
to
collapse
said
one
psa
group
engineer
and
since
it
s
a
market
that
s
already
quite
unprofitable
people
are
just
going
to
lose
