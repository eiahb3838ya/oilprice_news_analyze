ceraweek-energy execs says tariff gambit could hit shale, lng project costs
houston
reuters
energy
executives
say
the
trump
administration
s
proposed
steel
and
aluminum
tariffs
could
bump
up
the
cost
of
projects
needed
for
rapidly
rising
shale
oil
and
gas
output
by
three
to
percent
higher
construction
costs
could
slow
growth
in
production
and
exports
of
crude
and
natural
gas
from
shale
that
has
made
the
united
states
the
world
s
largest
gas
producer
and
second
largest
oil
producer
president
donald
trump
s
proposal
is
emerging
as
a
potential
spoiler
for
new
pipelines
drilling
rigs
offshore
platforms
and
refineries
to
handle
coming
oil
and
gas
production
companies
including
exxon
mobil
corp
kinder
morgan
inc
and
others
have
outlined
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
of
new
petrochemical
and
pipeline
expansions
in
the
united
states
the
administration
has
not
yet
formally
unveiled
its
plan
it
is
unclear
whether
exemptions
would
be
available
for
certain
sectors
or
for
steel
from
places
such
as
canada
the
biggest
foreign
provider
of
the
metal
to
the
united
states
trading
partners
have
said
they
could
counter
tariffs
with
their
own
levies
on
exports
if
the
proposed
tariffs
were
in
place
when
natural
gas
company
freeport
lng
was
building
its
first
three
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
production
lines
they
would
have
raised
the
dollar
construction
cost
by
about
million
or
between
percent
and
percent
chief
executive
michael
smith
said
in
an
interview
freeport
lng
is
in
the
process
of
building
a
fourth
production
line
at
the
lng
plant
in
texas
steel
tariffs
would
affect
the
economics
of
the
plant
but
not
deter
the
company
from
building
it
smith
said
on
the
sidelines
of
an
industry
gathering
in
houston
if
the
tariffs
lead
to
a
trade
war
with
china
then
freeport
lng
could
suffer
because
china
is
among
the
buyers
for
the
gas
he
said
export
capacity
was
less
than
million
tonnes
per
annum
mtpa
in
and
is
expected
to
top
mtpa
by
which
would
make
it
the
world
s
no
exporter
behind
australia
steel
accounts
for
as
much
as
percent
of
new
drilling
project
costs
while
higher
costs
would
not
halt
new
drilling
in
shale
fields
it
could
slow
it
down
jim

benchmark

according
to

kinder

declined
to
comment
on
the
pipeline
suppliers
when
the
proposal
was
first
announced
sources
at
exxon
mobil
told
reuters
that
increased
costs
from
tariffs
could
affect
the
company
s
plans
to
build
another
crude
oil
distillation
unit
at
its
baytown
refinery
that
would
make
it
the
largest
in
the
united
states
the
proposal
is
part
of
a
billion
expansion
of
several
refining
and
petrochemical
complexes
along
the
gulf
in
coming
years
since
billion
worth
of
petrochemical
projects
have
been
started
or
completed
across
the
united
states
the
shale
production
boom
has
overcome
bigger
hurdles
including
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
efforts
to
stem
its
rise
a
few
years
ago
by
flooding
the
market
with
oil
energy
production
is
projected
to
reach
million
barrels
of
oil
per

in
up
from
an
average
of
million
bpd
last
year
ihs
estimates
some
pipeline
projects
could
be
hamstrung
if
developers
can
not
buy
parts
made
outside
of
the
united

said
greg
armstrong

company
plains
all
american
pipeline
his
firm
has
about
billion
in
projects
on
the
drawing
board
and
some
of
the
steel
required
is
not
made
domestically
it
s
a
thornier
issue
than
is
printed
in
the
headlines
said
armstrong
if
you
can
t
get
what
you
need
you
kind
of
have
to
go
somewhere
else
outside
