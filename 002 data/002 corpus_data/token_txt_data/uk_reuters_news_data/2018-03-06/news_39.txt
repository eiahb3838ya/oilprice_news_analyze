new
york
reuters
rio
tinto
plc
and
two
former
top
executives
said
civil
fraud
charges
brought
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
over
a
failed
african
coal
project
are
plainly
wrong
and
should
be
thrown
out
in
a
court
filing
late
monday
night
rio
tinto
former
chief
executive
officer
tom
albanese
and
former
chief
financial
officer
guy
elliott
rejected
sec
claims
they
should
have
written
down
mozambique
coal
assets
no
more
than
months
after
buying
them
in
for
billion
billion
pounds
rather
than
waiting
months
the
delay
enabled
the
big
mining
group
to
raise
about
billion
from
investors
kept
in
the
dark
about
the
deterioration
the
sec
argued
in
a
lawsuit
filed
in
october
with
the
district
court
in
manhattan
the
defendants
said
that
in
the
months
after
the
acquisition
they
had
reason
to
believe
the
value
of
the
assets
had
actually
grown
by
billion
as
rising
prices
for
scarce
coking
coal
helped
offset
lower
barging
and
rail
capacity
the
market
viewed
the
eventual
billion
writedown
as
immaterial
in
the
context
of
a
company
with
total
assets
of
about
billion
they
also
said
adding
that
the
sec
did
not
claim
that
rio
tinto
s
stock
or
bond
prices
were
harmed
the
sec
alleges
that
rio
tinto
should
have
taken
the
impairment
within
just
months
of
acquisition
at
a
time
when
rio
tinto
had
not
yet
completed
its
analysis
of
the
quantity
and
quality
of
available
coal
or
determined
whether
there
was
a
viable
means
for
transporting
that
coal
to
market
the
defendants
said
the
sec
is
plainly
wrong
and
each
of
its
claims
consequently
must
be
dismissed
they
added
district
judge
analisa
torres
set
a
march
deadline
for
the
sec
to
respond
rio
tinto
wrote
off
most
of
the
assets
which
it
had
acquired
in
a
takeover
of
riversdale
mining
and
later
renamed
rio
tinto
coal
mozambique
in
january
and
sold
them
in
late
for
just
million
the
monday
filing
came
three
days
after
the
australian
securities
and
investments
commission
brought
its
own
civil
court
action
against
rio
tinto
albanese
and
elliott
over
the
coal
assets
