new
york
reuters
the
dollar
touched
a
low
on
tuesday
as
traders
bet
on
riskier
currencies
on
new
signs
of
a
thaw
in
relations
between
north
and
south
korea
and
the
north
s
willingness
to
discuss
denuclearization
with
the
united
states
north
and
south
korea
still
technically
at
war
since
but
with
tensions
having
eased
since
the
winter
olympics
hosted
by
the
south
last
month
will
hold
their
first
summit
in
more
than
a
decade
next
month
south
korea
said
on
tuesday
it
also
said
the
north
would
suspend
nuclear
tests
while
proposed
talks
with
the
united
states
on
denuclearization
were
under
way
but
the
stock
market
focused
on
concerns
over
a
possible
trade
war
after
president
donald
trump
announced
planned
tariffs
on
imports
of
steel
and
aluminum
last
week
the
major
indexes
eked
out
small
gains
on
tuesday
as
investors
weighed
mixed
signals
from
washington
republican
lawmakers
stepped
up
calls
for
trump
to
pull
back
from
the
tariffs
as
key
trading
partner
mexico
rejected
a
bid
by
washington
to
drive
a
wedge
between
it
and
canada
in
talks
to
renegotiate
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
while
trump
reiterated
his
plan
to
go
ahead
with
the
tariffs
the
dollar
seen
as
a
safe
haven
against
risk
in
recent
months
fell
further
after
news
of
the
north
and
south
korea
talks
as
investors
bought
the
australian
and
new
zealand
dollars
and
some
emerging
market
currencies
it
s
too
early
to
wholeheartedly
buy
these
currencies
because
of
the
chances
of
escalating
trade
tension
between
the
and
its
trading
partners
said
omer
esiner
chief
market
analyst
at
commonwealth
foreign
exchange
in
washington
the
dollar
index
which
tracks
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
other
major
currencies
fell
percent
up
percent
after
touching
its
lowest
level
since
the
euro
rose
percent
to
the
japanese
yen
weakened
percent
versus
the
greenback
to
per
dollar
while
sterling
was
at
up
percent
traders
await
clues
on
monetary
policy
direction
when
the
european
central
bank
and
the
bank
of
japan
hold
policy
meetings
on
thursday
and
friday
the
strength
of
the
euro
is
starting
to
put
pressure
on
the
economy
this
is
putting
pressure
on
the

stocks
edged
higher
in
europe
as
well
as
in
the
united
states
while
a
global
gauge
of
major
equity
markets
was
boosted
largely
by
gains
in
asia
after
stocks
there
were
battered
monday
on
concerns
over
a
global
trade
war
those
worries
eased
during
market
hours
on
monday
so
asian
equities
were
catching
up
on
wall
street
the
s
p
rose
for
a
third
straight
session
though
it
was
unclear
what
trump
s
final
decision
on
tariffs
would
be
the
market
is
basically
grasping
for
straws
around
what
the
tariff
policy
is
going
to
be
based
on
the
action
we
saw
today
it
s
hoping
it
doesn
t
turn
into
a
trade
war
