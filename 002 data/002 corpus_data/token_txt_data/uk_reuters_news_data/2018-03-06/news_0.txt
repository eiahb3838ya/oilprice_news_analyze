on
the

australia
for
processing
the
agreement
also
establishes
a
maritime
boundary
in
the
timor
sea
for
the
first
time
australia
had
sought
a
boundary
aligned
with
its
continental
shelf
but
east
timor
argued
the
border
should
lie
half
way
between
it
and
australia
placing
much
of
the
greater
sunrise
field
under
its
control
with
this
treaty
we
open
a
new
chapter
in
relations
between
australia
and
said
australian
foreign
minister
julie
bishop
who
signed
the
treaty
alongside
east
timor
s
deputy
minister
of
the
prime
minister
for
the
delimitation
of

hermenegildo
augusto
cabral
pereira
the
protracted
dispute
had
led
the
owners
of
greater
sunrise
woodside
petroleum
conocophillips
royal
dutch
shell
and
japan
s
osaka
gas
to
shelve
the
project
the
greater
sunrise
field
is
estimated
to
hold
trillion
cubic
feet
of
gas
and
million
barrels
of
condensates
which
analysts
have
previously
estimated
could
be
worth
billion
however
development
could
be
at
least
a
decade
away
with
woodside
looking
at
the
latter
half
of
the
next
decade
australian
associated
press
reported
shortly
before
the
signing
ceremony
that
east
timor
had
accused
australia
of
colluding
with
the
oil
companies
to
have
the
gas
piped
to
australia
for
processing
australia
rejects
absolutely
any
suggestion
that
we
have
acted
other
than
in
utmost
good
faith
throughout
this
conciliation
process
bishop
told
reporters
at
the
united
nations
the
way
is
now
clear
for
as
the
majority
beneficiary
of
the
division
of
the
resource
to
find
a
way
with
the
joint
venture
partners
to
develop
greater
sunrise
in
an
economically
viable
fashion
she
said
east
timor
had
been
pushing
hard
for
the
building
of
an
onshore
processing
plant
to
boost
its
economy
bishop
said
australia
does
not
have
a
position
and
that
the
main
concern
was
that
any
project
was
economically
viable
it
s
a
conciliation
process
it
was
never
meant
to
be
easy
we
had
ups
and
downs
in
this
months

the
focus
should
be
on
