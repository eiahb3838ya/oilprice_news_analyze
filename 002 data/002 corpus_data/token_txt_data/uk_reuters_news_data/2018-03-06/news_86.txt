shares
have

late
on

leading
republicans
including
house
of
representatives
speaker
paul
ryan
and
representative
kevin
brady
turned
up
the
pressure
on
trump
to
rethink
the
plan
on
monday
some
investors
also
saw
the
tariffs
threats
as
a
negotiating
tactic
to
get
a
better
deal
on
nafta
still
concerns
over
a
trade
war
were
far
from
dispelled
with
trump
describing
them
as
easy
to
win
repeating
his
earlier
comments
trump
was
expected
to
finalise
the
planned
tariffs
later
in
the
week
although
some
observers
familiar
with
the
process
said
it
could
occur
next
week
the
spectre
of
a
trade
war
was
not
the
only
source
of
concerns
for
the
stock
market
as
the
global
economy
steams
ahead
investors
have
become
increasingly
concerned
that
inflation
which
has
been
subdued
since
the
financial
crisis
could
finally
pick
up
while
moderate
inflation
generally
supports
equity
investors
rapid
inflation
or
fear
of
it
could
prompt
the
federal
reserve
to
hike
rates
faster
undermining
the
attraction
of
equities
given
the
importance
of
bond
yields
to
equity
valuation
equity
investors
are
affected
by
potential
changes
in
bond
yields
just
as
much
as
investors
said
colin
moore
global
chief
investment
officer
at
columbia
threadneedle
investments
in
the
current
environment
although
inflation
appears
to
be
increasing
it
s
still
not
likely
to
cause
yields
to
rise
to
levels
that
would
be
problematic
for
equities
i
estimate
that
problematic
level
to
be
a
percent
bond
yields
rose
as
wall
street
shares
rallied
the
treasuries
yield
rose
back
to
percent
from
last
week
s
low
of
percent
a
break
of
last
month
s
peak
of
percent
could
trigger
fresh
selling
in
treasuries
traders
say
in
the
currency
market
the
euro
traded
at
extending
its
recovery
from
a
low
of
hit
on
thursday
the
euro
managed
to
recover
losses
made
on
monday
after
two
leaders
made
early
plays
to
govern
italy
following
an
inconclusive
election
where
voters
shunted
mainstream
parties
to
the
sidelines
as
none
of
the
three
main
factions
had
enough
seats
to
govern
alone
president
sergio
mattarella
is
expected
to
open
formal
coalition
talks
in
april
with
early
elections
possible
if
no
accord
is
found
with
any
coalition
that
can
be
formed
likely
to
have
a
right
of
centre
bias
this
ought
to
be
bad
for
the
euro
but
the
german
election
result
appears
to
have
counterbalanced
any
detrimental
effects
we
are
holding
to
our
stance
that
this
is
not
the
time
to
be
adding
italian
risk

hatfield
