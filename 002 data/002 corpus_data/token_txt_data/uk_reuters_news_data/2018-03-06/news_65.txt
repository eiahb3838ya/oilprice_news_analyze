share

on

after

donald
trump
faced
growing
pressure
from
political
allies
to
pull
back
from
proposed
steel
and
aluminium
tariffs
and
a
potential
global
trade
war
european
sentiment
was
also
supported
after
germany
reformed
its
coalition
government
to
end
more
than
five
months
in

too
with

a
fraction
higher
and
the

a
touch
weaker
as
the

steadied
over

above
the
noise
about

we
are
getting
now
we
would
we
would
need
to
see
real
evidence
it
is
damaging

time

michael
metcalfe
we
have
been
here
before
in
and
with
steel
tariffs
and
that
wasn
t
top
republican
politicians
including
house
speaker
paul
ryan
urged
trump
on
monday
not
to
go
ahead
with
tariffs
on
foreign
imports
of
steel
and
aluminium
even
though
the
president
said
he
would
not
back
down
he
suggested
canada
and
mexico
could
be
exempted
if
a
new
nafta
trade
deal
was
agreed
there
was
speculation
that
this
had
been
the
main
motivation
behind
the

snapping
five

japan

too
by
reassurances
from
the
head
of
the

of
japan
that
it
would
not
suddenly
end
stimulus
korean
shares
also
erased
the
remainder
of
the
hit
they
took
after
trump
s
tariff
warnings
last
week
the
country
is
seen
as
being
among
the
most
exposed
in
asia
due
to
the
large
amount
of
steel
it
exports
to
the
united
states
even
in
the
face
of
such
bad
news
it
shows
the
volume
of
money
in
the
equity
market
that
is
looking
for
an
entry
point

the
threat
of
a

not
the
only
source
of
tension
for
the
world
s
financial
markets
as
the
global
economy
steams
ahead
investors
have
become
increasingly
concerned
that
inflation
which
has
been
subdued
since
the

crisis
could
finally
pick
up
and
lead
to
fast
interest
rate
hikes
the

the
ecb
is
going
to
be
presenting
growth
forecasts
that
are
likely
to
be
stronger
but
will
be
at
pains
to
stress
that
the
move
away
from
monetary
easing
will
be
delicately
done
