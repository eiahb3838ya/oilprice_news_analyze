update 3-chevron backs 2018 production rise, eyes share buybacks
reuters
oil
major
chevron
corp
said
on
tuesday
it
should
be
able
to
raise
production
as
planned
by
between
and
percent
in
and
buy
back
shares
for
the
first
time
in
at
least
three
years
even
without
a
substantial
rise
in
oil
prices
the
oil
producer
s
shares
rose
as
much
as
percent
after
chevron
cut
billion
off
the
of
its
capital
spending
plans
and
promised
cashflow
permitting
to
return
to
share
buybacks
for
the
first
time
since
the
company
now
expects
to
invest
between
billion
and
billion
each
year
until
compared
to
an
earlier
forecast
of
billion
to
billion
and
reassured
investors
paying
dividends
remained
a
top
priority
chief
executive
michael
wirth
said
he
planned
to
generate
extra
free
cash
by
selling
off
assets
producing
more
oil
at
higher
margins
and
cutting
expenses
as
oil
firms
ramp
up
production
in
response
to
a
recovery
of
crude
prices
we
intend
to
maintain
capital
discipline
he
said
in
a
statement
even
with
no
further
commodity
price
appreciation
we
expect
to
deliver
stronger
upstream
cash
margins
and
production
growth
this
is
a
powerful
combination
chevron
which
said
it
intended
to
raise
free
cash
flow
in
and
thereafter
said
only
that
buybacks
would
start
as
we
generate
surplus
cash
the
company
said
it
would
increase
output
of
barrels
of
oil
by
more
than
in
production
in
its
shale
acreage
in
the
permian
basin
in
new
mexico
and
texas
was
expected
to
reach
about
barrels
per
day
by
the
end
of
and
by
the
end
of
the
production
estimate
excluded
asset
sales
and
was
based
on
oil
prices
at
a
barrel
versus
for
brent
crude
and
for
light
crude
on
tuesday
our
initial
takeaway
from
chevron
s
annual
analyst
day
are
positive
with
the
company
providing
encouraging
production
guidance
beyond
while
also
tightening
the
range
in
forward
capital
spending

wrote
in
a
note
this
adds
confidence
to
our
view
that
the
steep
ramp
up
in
chevron
s
cash
generation
will
be
a
key
driver
of
the
stock
leading
to
incremental
shareholder
the
company
s
shares
were
up
about
percent
