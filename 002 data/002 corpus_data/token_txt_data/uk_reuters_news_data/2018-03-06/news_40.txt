a
manor
house

sources
said
on
tuesday
prince
mohammed
s
visit
part
of
his
first
foreign
tour
as
heir
apparent
is
aimed
at
persuading
britain
that
his

a
better
place
to
invest
and
a
more
tolerant
society
the
trip
will
include

the
queen

dinner
with
heir
to
the
throne
prince
charles
and
his
son
prince
william

with
british
intelligence
chiefs
the
inclusion
of
the
prestigious
trip
to
chequers
and
two
audiences
with
the

the
extent
to
which
london
is
prepared
to
endorse
reforms
in
saudi
arabia
which
have
loosened
social
restrictions
on
women
the
visit
is
expected
to
attract
protests
from
human
rights
campaigners
particularly
over
britain
s
licensing
of
billion
pounds
worth
of
weapons
to
saudi
arabia
since
the
start
of
a
conflict
in
yemen
where
more
than
people
have
been
killed
nevertheless
the
british
government
is
keen
to
use
the
trip
to
expand
their
longstanding
alliance
beyond
defence
and
security
and
into
trade
and
investment
eying
both
an
expanded
market
in
saudi
arabia
for
service
sector
exports
and
attracting
saudi
cash
to
finance
domestic
projects
the
visit
and
a
trip
to
the
united
states
later
this
month
could
also
shape
saudi
arabia
s
decision
on
where
to
list
oil
giant
aramco
something
britain
is
keen
to
attract
to
the
city
of
london
at
a
time
when
sources
say
the
chances
of
london
and
new
york
hosting
the
ipo
appear
to
be
receding
