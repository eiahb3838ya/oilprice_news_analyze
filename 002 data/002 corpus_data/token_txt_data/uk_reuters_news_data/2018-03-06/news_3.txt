foreign

luis
videgaray
said
on
tuesday
on
a
caribbean
trip
to
promote
efforts
to
erode
venezuela
s
diplomatic
influence
videgaray
said
he
was
hoping
to
get
more
mexican
firms
to
come
to
jamaica
as
suppliers
of
oil
and
as
potential
investors
in
developing
jamaican
oil
resources
last
month
secretary

state
rex
tillerson
announced
that
mexico
canada
and
the
united
states
were
looking
at
how
to
mitigate
the
effect
sanctions
on
venezuela
would
have
in
the
caribbean
videgaray
who
visited
lucia
before
jamaica
said
deeper
energy
ties
could
serve
as
a
model
elsewhere
in
the
island
region
whatever
we
do
in
jamaica
can
be
a
learning
experience
for
what
we
do
with
other
caribbean
countries
he
said
without
directly
mentioning
efforts
to
weaken
venezuela
s
support
among
countries
grateful
for
past
oil
largesse
while
jamaica
no
longer
imports
venezuelan
crude

was
a
founding
member
of
the
south
american
nation
s
petrocaribe
program
that
provided
cheap
loans
for
oil
to
caribbean
nations
the
legacy
of
the
program
has
helped
venezuela
win
votes
in
the
organization
of
american
states
to
defeat
motions
against
president
nicolas
maduro
whose
socialist
government
has
overseen
an
economic
crisis
in
venezuela
mexico
s
oil
output
has
fallen
sharply
and
the
energy
ministry
has
said
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
country
to
replace
petrocaribe
we
are
a
economy
and
any
kind
of
cooperation
that
we
do
and
any
business
that
we
foster
is
according
to
market
principles
said
videgaray
standing
next
to
his
jamaican
counterpart
kamina
johnson
smith
he
added

jointly
owned
by
a

jamaica
already
buys
spot
cargos
of
crude
from
mexico
a
major
oil
supplier
to
the
united
states
mexico
has
been
gradually
opening
up
its
oil
sector
following
a
constitutional
reform
in
that
ended
decades
of
monopoly
control
by
national
oil
company
pemex
its
ability
to
maximize
crude
processing
has
been
hobbled
