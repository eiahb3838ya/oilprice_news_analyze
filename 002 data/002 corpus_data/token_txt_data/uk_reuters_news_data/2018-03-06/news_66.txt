psa
group
boss
carlos
tavares
said
he
will
introduce
demands
that
eu
governments
commit
to
develop
networks
in
exchange
for
previously
agreed
emissions
goals
taking
effect
in
backed
by
heavy
fines
in
what
could
be
the
start
of
a
pushback
against
the
agreed
carbon
emissions
targets
by
the
main
acea
european
carmakers
lobby
tavares
who
currently
chairs
the
acea
said
he
would
propose
the
new
demands
to
its
board
this
week
i
think
it
s
only
logical
that
there
should
be
commitments
from
governments
tavares
told
reporters
at
the
geneva
auto
show
the
potential
suspension
of
penalties
if
charging
network
rollouts
fall
short
of
targets
is
to
be
discussed
he
added
in
a
newspaper
interview
last
week
tavares
suggested
carmakers
should
not
be
fined
for
if
the
density
of
charging
networks
remained
inadequate
the
accelerating
decline
of
diesel
long
used
by
carmakers
to
boost
is
undermining
carmakers
efforts
to
meet
the
looming
goals
and
avoid
big
penalties
