a

talks

the
cgt
and
fellow
union
fo
have
called
on
striking
workers
to
step
up
blockades
of
refineries
and
fuel
depots
so
companies
are
faced
with
supply
shortages
defresne
told
reuters
earlier
on
friday
that
total
s
grandpuits
refinery
south
of
paris
one
of
the
refineries
where
workers
remain
on
strike
was
completely
blocked
and
had
only
enough
crude
to
continue
functioning
until
sunday
midday
he
said
later
on
friday
that
the
union
had
allowed
crude
deliveries
at
grandpuits
and
normandy
refineries
to
keep
them
running
at
reduced
output
until
monday
but
a
total
spokeswoman
said
france
s
cim
oil
storage
and
dispatch
services
company
which
supplies
crude
to
refineries
operated
by
total
and
exxon
mobil
corp
was
working
normally
total
denies
the
fact
that
the
grandpuits
refinery
will
run
out
of
crude
forcing
a
shutdown
she
said
although
she
said
outbound
deliveries
of
fuel
from
grandpuits
were
blocked
some
cim
employees
staged
a
brief
walkout
on
thursday
in
solidarity
with
the
striking
refinery
workers
but
they
resumed
work
later
in
the
day
the
strike
over
pay
and
bonuses
adds
to
challenges
confronting
fuel
companies
which
are
also
facing
protests
from
the
yellow
vest
movement
of
citizens
who
oppose
higher
fuel
taxes
and
have
sporadically
blockaded
oil
depots
this
week
