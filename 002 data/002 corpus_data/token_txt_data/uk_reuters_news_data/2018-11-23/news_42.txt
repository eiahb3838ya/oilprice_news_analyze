friday
trade
as

were
reluctant
to
make
any
big
bets
in

tensions
signs
of
slowing
earnings
and
brexit
negotiations
a
draft
deal
between
britain
and
the
european
union
on
future
relations
offered
some
hope
for
battered
markets
though
more
evidence
of
pressure
on
corporate
earnings
in
europe
kept
equity
investors
sidelined

closed
overnight

thanksgiving
and
japan

percent
at
on
thursday
stock
markets
in
europe
were
hit
by
disappointing
earnings
on
further
signs
that
corporate
profit
growth
is
peaking
globally
those
earnings
underscored
the
lingering
anxiety
among
equity
investors
as
trade
tensions
slowing
global
investment
and
growth
kept

describes
a
close
relationship

agreement
follows
a
draft
treaty
last
week
that
set
the
terms
for
britain
s
departure
from
the
eu
in
march
but
the
deal
faces
a
rocky
ride
once
it
reaches
a
deeply
divided
british
parliament
with
hardline
eurosceptic
and
staunch
factions
and
various
shades
of
gray

at
a
summit
on
sunday
the
meaningful
vote
in
the
uk
parliament
is
likely
in

would
be
far
too
optimistic
