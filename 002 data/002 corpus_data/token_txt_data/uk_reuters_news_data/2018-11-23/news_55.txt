scientists weigh up stratospheric sunlight barrier to curb warming

spraying
chemicals
high
above
the
earth
to
slow
global
warming
could
be
remarkably
inexpensive
costing
about
billion
a
year
over
a
period
according
to
a
study
by
scientists
some
researchers
say
the
technique
known
as
stratospheric
aerosol
injection
sai
could
limit
rising
temperatures
that
are
causing
climate
change
as
yet
unproven
and
hypothetical
it
would
involve
the
use
of
huge
hoses
cannons
or
specially
designed
aircraft
to
spray
large
quantities
of
sulphate
particles
into
the
upper
layer
of
the
atmosphere
to
act
as
a
reflective
barrier
against
sunlight
total
costs
to
launch
a
hypothetical
sai
effort
years
from
now
would
be
billion
scientists
at
harvard
university
said
in
a
report
published
in
the
journal
environmental
research
letters
adding
that
average
annual
operating
costs
would
be
about
billion
a
year
over
years
discounting
other
methods
of
deployment
because
of
cost
and
feasibility
the
research
assumes
a
special
aircraft
can
be
designed
to
fly
at
an
altitude
of
about
and
carry
a
load
of
tonnes
after
direct
input
from
several
aerospace
and
engine
companies
the
scientists
said
they
have
developed
a
design
that
could
be
suitable
and
could
be
ready
to
be
deployed
in
years
aiming
to
cut
the
rate
of
temperature
change
in
half
the
scientists
emphasised
that
this
is
merely
a
hypothetical
scenario
we
make
no
judgment
about
the
desirability
of
sai
we
simply
show
that
a
hypothetical
deployment
programme
commencing
years
hence
while
both
highly
uncertain
and
ambitious
would
indeed
be
technically
possible
from
an
engineering
perspective
it
would
also
be
remarkably
inexpensive
the
report
said
there
are
risks
to
such
unproven
potential
technologies
scientists
have
said
sai
could
result
in
negative
consequences
such
as
causing
droughts
or
extreme
weather
in
other
parts
of
the
world
harm
crop
yields
as
well
as
potential
public
health
and
governance
issues
it
also
does
not
address
the
issue
of
rising
carbon
dioxide
emissions
the
main
greenhouse
gas
blamed
for
global
warming
commenting
on
the
study
phil
williamson
at
the
university
of
east
anglia
said
such
scenarios
are
fraught
with
problems
and
international
agreement
to
go
ahead
with
such
action
would
seem
