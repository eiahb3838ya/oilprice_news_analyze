total says batteries investment depends on level playing field with asia
paris
reuters
oil
and
gas
major
total
will
invest
heavily
in
car
battery
production
only
if
it
can
compete
on
a
level
playing
field
with
chinese
and
asian
manufacturers
its
chief
executive
said
on
friday
battery
maker
saft
a
unit
of
total
said
in
may
that
it
planned
to
invest
more
than
million
euros
million
in
a
european
battery
alliance
project
to
research
develop
and
build
a
new
generation
battery
to
compete
with
asian
and
rivals
saft
s
alliance
with
siemens
solvay
and
manz
plans
to
begin
mass
production
of
new
generation
batteries
from
early
but
total
ceo
patrick
pouyanne
is
concerned
that
european
manufacturers
would
be
operating
at
a
disadvantage
to
asian
rivals
i
will
not
launch
the
group
and
saft
in
operations
worth
several
billion
euros
if
in
the
end
we
do
not
have
the
fair
competitive
framework
between
us
and
others
pouyanne
said
at
a
conference
in
paris
adding
that
some
chinese
manufacturers
benefit
from
state
aid
several
projects
have
been
announced
in
recent
months
to
build
battery
plants
in
europe
and
last
week
the
german
government
said
it
had
set
aside
about
billion
euros
to
support
battery
cell
production
today
if
you
want
to
provide
an
electric
vehicle
in
china
with
a
battery
it
must
be
built
in
china
by
a
chinese
manufacturer
pouyanne
said
that
s
a
problem
and
for
now
the
dialogue
we
re
having
with
european
governments
is
to
know
if
we
can
protect
ourselves
like
that
in
france
called
on
thursday
for
european
battery
manufacturers
and
carmakers
to
create
a
consortium
able
to
meet
the
growing
demand
for
electric
vehicles
and
compete
with
dominant
asian
producers
pouyanne
said
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
the
sector
to
replicate
what
happened
in
the
solar
panel
industry
where
european
companies
invested
heavily
only
to
close
down
in
the
face
of
chinese
competition
