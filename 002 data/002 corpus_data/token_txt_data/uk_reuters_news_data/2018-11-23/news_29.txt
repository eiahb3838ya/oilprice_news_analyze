u.s. report to detail costs of climate change as trump downplays threat
nov
reuters
the
government
on
friday
will
issue
a
new
report
detailing
the
threat
climate
change
poses
to
the
economy
in
what
is
expected
to
be
a
dire
warning
at
odds
with
the
trump
administration
s
fuels
agenda
the
congressionally
mandated
report
written
with
the
help
of
more
than
a
dozen
government
agencies
and
departments
will
supplement
a
study
issued
last
year
that
concluded
humans
are
the
main
driver
of
global
warming
and
warned
of
potentially
catastrophic
effects
to
the
planet
it
is
extremely
likely
that
human
influence
has
been
the
dominant
cause
of
the
observed
warming
since
the
century
according
to
that
report
there
is
no
convincing
alternative
explanation
this
year
s
report
is
expected
to
detail
costs
of
climate
change
and
provide
scientific
assessments
of
the
risks
and
the
extent
to
which
people
can
adapt
to
it
the
report
is
expected
clash
with
policy
under
president
donald
trump
who
has
been
rolling
back
environmental
and
climate
protections
to
maximize
production
of
domestic
fossil
fuels
including
crude
oil
already
the
highest
in
the
world
above
saudi
arabia
and
russia
trump
last
year
announced
his
intention
to
withdraw
the
united
states
from
the
paris
deal
agreed
by
nearly
nations
to
combat
climate
change
arguing
the
accord
would
hurt
the
economy
and
provide
little
tangible
environmental
benefit
under
the
paris
pact
s
rules
however
trump
can
not
officially
withdraw
from
the
agreement
until
after
the
presidential
election
the
government
still
sends
delegations
to
climate
negotiations
trump
and
several
members
of
his
cabinet
have
also
repeatedly
cast
doubt
on
the
science
of
climate
change
saying
the
causes
are
not
yet
settled
that
is
despite
the
fact
an
overwhelming
majority
of
climate
scientists
around
the
globe
agree
that
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels
drives
global
warming
and
is
leading
to
rising
seas
flooding
droughts
and
more
frequent
powerful
storms
previous
research
including
from
government
scientists
has
concluded
that
climate
change
could
have
severe
economic
consequences
including
damage
to
infrastructure
water
supplies
and
agriculture
severe
weather
and
other
impacts
also
increase
the
risk
of
disease
transmission
decrease
air
quality
and
can
increase
mental
health
problems
among
other
effects
according
to
and
international
studies
thirteen
government
departments
and
agencies
from
the
agriculture
department
to
nasa
were
part
of
the
committee
that
compiled
the
new
report
