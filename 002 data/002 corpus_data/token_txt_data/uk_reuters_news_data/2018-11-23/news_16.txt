european
stock
markets
rose
on
friday
after
a
volatile
week
in
which
company
earnings
and
growth
worries
hit
stocks
although
the
euro
sank
after
business
surveys
from
germany
and
the
euro
zone
italian
stocks
led
the
bounce
in
equities
rallying
hard
after
the
country
s
bond
yields
fell
after
a
press
report
that
eu
affairs
minister
paolo
savona
is
considering
resigning
over
the
government
s
decision
to
challenge
european
union
budget
rules
the
stoxx
index
was
up
percent
europe
s
performance
on
friday
stood
in
contrast
to
asia
where
steep
losses
in
chinese
markets
hit
stocks
amid
lingering
trade
war
tensions
and
worries
about
global
growth
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
fell
percent
as
chinese
tumbled
percent
and
the
shanghai
composite
index
lost
percent
not
all
was
cheerful
in
europe
though
surveys
of
german
and
euro
zone
purchasing
managers
came
in
weaker
than
expected
pushing
the
euro
to
its
lowest
in
three
days
and
setting
up
the
single
currency
for
its
worst
week
in
a
month
the
disappointing
readings
will
likely
be
of
concern
to
policymakers
at
the
european
central
bank
who
are
expected
to
draw
a
line
under
their
trillion
euro
asset
purchase
programme
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
key
message
from
the
pmi
data
is
that
it
has
raised
doubts
about
whether
the
economy
will
rebound
after
weakness
so
there
s
no
wonder
the
news
has
been
taken
badly
by
the
market
said
jack
allen
senior
european
economist
at
capital
economics
in
london
the
big
picture
is
that
the
data
is
not
bad
enough
for
the
ecb
to
not
end
asset
purchases
at
the
end
of
the
year
but
if
growth
fails
to
rebound
they
ecb
policymakers
will
have
to
think
twice
about
raising
rates
next
purchasing
manager
indexes
from
the
united
states
due
at
gmt
will
be
watched
for
a
reading
on
where
global
growth
is
headed
the

on

by

anxiety
among

as

tensions
slowing
global

growth
a
draft
deal
between
britain

on

relations
reached
on

did
little
to
lighten
the
mood
daiwa

chris
scicluna
said
asian
equity
indices
have
largely
picked
up
the
baton
of
negativity
from
european
markets
he
noted
investor
apprehension
was
high
before
next
week
s
buenos
aires
bilateral
meeting
between

xi
jinping
and
added
following

tough
rhetoric
at
the
apec
summit
making
it
clear
that
the
trump
administration
is
in
no
hurry
to
end
the
trade
war

calling
on
china
to
change
its
ways

perhaps
no
