tumbled
nearly
percent
this

to
a
more
than
low
knocked
lower
by
a
slide
in
oil
prices
forecasts
for
a
warmer

winter
and
ample

in

were
estimated
at
per

british

mmbtu
cents
lower
than
last
week
according
to
traders
the
big
question
mark
right
now
is
how
the
weather
will
pan
out
as
the
market
will
quickly
turn
once
it
starts
to
get
cold
but
until
then
it
s
right
now
in
many
places
said
a
lng
trader
referring
to
high
storage
levels
of
natural
gas
in
north
asia
temperatures
in
major
cities
tokyo
beijing
and
shanghai
in
the
world

are
expected
to
be
warmer

next

weather
data
from
refinitiv
eikon
showed
demand
from
in
north
asia
remained
muted
while
a
big
drop
in
brent
oil
prices
was
causing
jitters
in
the
lng
market
trade
sources
said
oil
prices
slumped
to
lows
on
friday
pulled
down
by
concerns
of
an
emerging
global
supply
overhang
amid
a
bleak
economic
outlook
typically
changes
in
brent
tend
to
have
a
bigger
impact
on
asian
lng
prices
due
to
lack
of
liquidity
in
asian
gas
derivatives
said
a
second
lng
trader
trading
remained
thin
in
the
region
with
several
lng
tankers
still
floating
the
fuel
around
asia
but
the
situation
may
soon
stabilise
as
have
stopped
reselling
cargoes
the
trader
said
the
chinese
are
not
reselling
cargoes
like
they
were
doing
recently
so
i
think
situation
could
be
bottoming
out
the
trader
added

india

gspc

seeking
two
cargoes
for

december
while

the
results
were
not
immediately

was
transferring
a
cargo
of
russia
s
yamal
lng
to
another

off
