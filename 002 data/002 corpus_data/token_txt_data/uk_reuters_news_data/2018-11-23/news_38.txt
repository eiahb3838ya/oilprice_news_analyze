berlin
reuters
a
german
court
has
ruled
volkswagen
must
reimburse
the
owner
of
a
golf
the
full
original
price
of
his
vehicle
bought
in
dealing
a
blow
to
the
carmaker
as
the
legal
battles
over
its
emissions
cheating
scandal
drag
on
volkswagen
vw
said
it
believed
the
court
in
augsburg
had
misapplied
the
law
and
that
it
would
appeal
the
ruling
at
the
higher
regional
court
the
augsburg
civil
court
ruled
on
that
vw
had
acted
immorally
by
deliberately
installing
software
to
increase
sales
and
profits
a
spokesman
for
the
court
said
on
friday
the
court
ordered
vw
to
repay
the
owner
the
original
price
of
almost
euros
according
to
a
copy
of
the
ruling
in
our
opinion
there
is
no
legal
basis
for
customer
complaints
customers
have
suffered
neither
losses
nor
damages
the
vehicles
are
safe
and
roadworthy
vw
said
in
a
statement
it
added
that
around
judgements
had
been
issued
in
connection
with
its
diesel
emissions
scandal
which
came
to
light
in
and
the
majority
of
customer
complaints
had
been
unsuccessful
at
district
and
higher
courts
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
augsburg
thereby
stands
in
contradiction
to
multiple
decisions
of
other
courts
in
comparable
cases
vw
said
its
shares
were
little
changed
at
euros
at
gmt
vw
has
said
about
million
diesel
cars
worldwide
were
fitted
with
software
that
could
cheat
emissions
tests
designed
to
limit
noxious
car
fumes
the
german
carmaker
has
agreed
to
pay
billions
of
dollars
in
the
united
states
to
settle
claims
from
owners
environmental
regulators
states
and
dealers
it
offered
to
buy
back
polluting
vehicles
the
company
has
not
reached
a
similar
deal
in
europe
where
it
faces
billions
of
euros
in
claims
from
investors
and
customers
in
the
worst
business
crisis
in
its
history
