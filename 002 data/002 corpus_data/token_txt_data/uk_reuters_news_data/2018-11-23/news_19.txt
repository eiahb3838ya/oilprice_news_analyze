european
markets
opened
higher
on
friday
with
most
stock
indexes
rising
modestly
after
a
volatile
week
in
which
company
earnings
and
growth
worries
hit
stocks
though
the
euro
sank
after
a
german
business
survey
italian
stocks
led
the
bounce
in
equities
rallying
hard
after
the
country
s
bond
yields
fell
after
a
press
report
that
eu
affairs
minister
paolo
savona
is
considering
resigning
over
the
government
s
decision
to
challenge
european
union
budget
rules
the
stoxx
index
was
up
percent
europe
s
performance
on
friday
stood
in
contrast
to
asia
where
steep
losses
in
chinese
markets
hit
stocks
amid
lingering
trade
war
tensions
and
worries
about
global
growth
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
fell
percent
as
chinese
tumbled
percent
and
the
shanghai
composite
index
lost
percent
not
all
was
cheerful
in
europe
though
german
business
surveys
came
in
weaker
than
expected
pushing
the
euro
to
its
lowest
in
three
days
euro
zone
business
growth
was
much
weaker
than
expected
this
month
as
exports
fell
sharply
hurt
by
a
slowing
global
economy
and
a
united
trade
war
the
disappointing
readings
will
likely
be
of
concern
to
policymakers
at
the
european
central
bank
who
are
expected
to
draw
a
line
under
their
trillion
euro
asset
purchase
programme
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
economy
in
the
euro
zone
has
cooled
significantly
over
the
past
months
and
unless
this
is
just
a
brief
interlude
the
european
central
bank
might
be
forced
to
stick
to
an
expansionary
monetary
policy

thu
lan
nguyen
a

strategist

purchasing

down
percent
on
thursday
stock
markets
in
europe
were
hit
by
disappointing
earnings
on
further
signs
that
corporate
profit
growth
is
peaking
globally
those
earnings
underscored
the
lingering
anxiety
among
equity
investors
as
trade
tensions
slowing
global
investment
and
growth
kept
stock
markets
on
the
back

after
a
difficult
october

relations
reached
on
thursday
did
little
to
lighten
the
mood
daiwa

chris
scicluna
said
asian
equity
indices
have
largely
picked
up
the
baton
of
negativity
from
european
markets
he
noted
investor
apprehension
was
high
before
next

s
buenos
aires
bilateral
between
president
donald
trump

chinese
president
xi
jinping
and
added
following
vp
pence
s
tough
rhetoric
at
the
apec
summit
making
it
clear
that
the
trump
administration
is
in
no
hurry
to
end
the
trade
war
and
calling
on
china
to
change
its
ways
that

perhaps
no

the

market
the

rising
more

on
the
news
of
the
draft
agreement
between
britain
and
the
eu
which
describes
a
close
relationship
the
agreement
follows
a
draft
treaty
last
week
that
set
the
terms
for
britain
s
departure
from
the
eu
in
march
but
the
deal
faces
a
rocky
ride
once
it
reaches
a
deeply
divided
british
parliament
containing
hardline
eurosceptic
and
staunch
factions
