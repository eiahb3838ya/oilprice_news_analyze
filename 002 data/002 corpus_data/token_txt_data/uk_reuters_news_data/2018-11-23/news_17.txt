london
reuters
a
small
british
energy
supplier
called
spark
energy
supply
limited
has
ceased
to
trade
regulator
ofgem
said
on
friday
promising
to
find
a
new
supplier
for
customers
soon
a
number
of
other
small
energy
providers
have
gone
bust
in
britain
prompting
ofgem
on
wednesday
to
propose
financial
and
customer
stress
tests
for
energy
suppliers
wanting
to
enter
the
market
on
friday
it
said
the
outstanding
credit
balances
of
spark
energy
s
customers
would
be
protected
and
there
would
be
no
disruption
to
supplies
it
did
the
same
for
the
customers
of
extra
energy
on
wednesday
a
push
to
increase
competitiveness
in
britain
s
energy
market
has
reduced
the
market
share
of
the
six
largest
companies
to
percent
from
over
percent
in
recent
years
with
smaller
independent
companies
in
operation
however
their
rapid
rise
has
led
to
questions
over
their
viability
as
with
less
capital
available
to
make
hedges
some
may
have
been
vulnerable
to
soaring
wholesale
commodity
price
rises
