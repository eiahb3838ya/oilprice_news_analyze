german
environment
minister
svenja
schulze
has
told
a
newspaper
she
does
not
think
software
updates
for
diesel
vehicles
in
germany
will
be
enough
to
solve
air
quality
problems
and
that
hardware
retrofits
are
the
best
way
to
avoid
driving
bans
the
german
car
industry
which
accounts
for
some
jobs
in
europe
s
biggest
economy
is
struggling
with
a
global
backlash
against
diesel
cars
after
volkswagen
admitted
in
that
it
had
cheated
exhaust
tests
chancellor
angela
merkel
has
said
she
will
do
everything
possible
to
avoid
driving
bans
but
disagreements
over
how
to
tackle
the
problem
of
diesel
cars
with
high
nitrogen
oxide
nox
emissions
threaten
to
further
strain
her
coalition
with
the
social
democrats
spd
in
an
interview
with
tagesspiegel
due
to
be
published
on
sunday
schulze
said
i
fear
that
in
cities
where
the
limits
have
been
far
exceeded
munich
stuttgart
and
others
software
updates
alone
will
not
she
added
the
many
measures
from
the
immediate
programme
for
clean
air
such
as
electrification
of
buses
are
good
and
will
help
many
cities
but
overall
they
aren
t
enough
to
solve
the
problem
in
cities
that
are
particularly
badly
schulze
of
the
spd
said
she
was
therefore
campaigning
hard
for
vehicles
to
get
technical
retrofits
adding
in
my
view
that
s
the
only
realistic
way
to
avoid
driving
asked
whether
the
carmakers
should
pay
for
the
hardware
retrofits
themselves
she
said
yes
they
are
the
ones
who
have
caused
she
said
hardware
retrofits
were
especially
necessary
in
particularly
badly
affected
urban
areas
where
there
was
no
other
way
to
stick
to
nox
limits
adding
this
was
likely
to
be
around
cities
however
german
transport
minister
andreas
scheuer
a
member
of
the
bavarian
csu
sister
party
of
merkel
s
christian
democrats
cdu
opposes
costly
hardware
retrofits
saying
he
is
committed
to
meeting
emissions
targets
using
measures
already
being
implemented
