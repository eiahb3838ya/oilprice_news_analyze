venezuelan
soldiers
opened
fire
on
indigenous
people
near
the
border
with
brazil
on
friday
killing
two
as
president
nicolas
maduro
sought
to
block
efforts
to
bring
aid
into
his
economically
devastated
nation
the
united
states
which
is
among
dozens
of
nations
to
recognise
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
as
venezuela
s
legitimate
president
has
been
stockpiling
aid
in
the
colombian
frontier
town
of
cucuta
to
ship
across
the
border
this
weekend
with
tensions
running
high
after
guaido
invoked
the
constitution
to
declare
an
interim
presidency
last
month
maduro
has
denied
there
is
a
humanitarian
crisis
in
venezuela
despite
widespread
shortages
of
food
and
medicine
and
hyperinflation
he
says
the
opposition
efforts
are
a
cheap
show
the
socialist
president
who
took
power
in
and
was
in
an
election
last
year
widely
viewed
as
fraudulent
has
declared
venezuela
s
southern
border
with
brazil
closed
ahead
of
the
opposition
s
plan
to
bring
in
the
aid
on
saturday
late
on
friday
the
government
shuttered
the
tachira
frontier
that
connects
with
cucuta
some
political
analysts
say
the
looming
showdown
is
less
about
solving
venezuela
s
needs
and
more
about
testing
the
military
s
loyalty
to
maduro
by
daring
it
to
turn
the
aid
away
with
inflation
running
at
more
than
million
percent
a
year
and
currency
controls
restricting
imports
of
basic
goods
a
growing
share
of
the
country
s
roughly
million
people
is
suffering
from
malnutrition
guaido
showed
up
late
on
friday
at
a
fundraising
concert
in
cucuta
backed
by
british
billionaire
richard
branson
that
was
estimated
to
have
attracted
nearly
people
his
appearance
with
colombian
president
ivan
duque
was
an
open
challenge
to
maduro
given
that
the
supreme
court
has
banned
him
from
international
travel
on
grounds
he
is
under
investigation
for
allegedly
helping
foreign
countries
to
interfere
in
internal
matters
friday
s
violence
broke
out
in
the
village
of
kumarakapay
in
southern
venezuela
after
an
indigenous
community
stopped
a
military
convoy
heading
towards
the
border
with
brazil
that
they
believed
was
attempting
to
block
aid
according
to
community
leaders
richard
fernandez
and
ricardo
delgado
soldiers
later
entered
the
village
and
opened
fire
killing
a
couple
and
injuring
several
others
they
said
a
regional
official
confirmed
that
two
people
were
killed
i
stood
up
to
them
to
back
the
humanitarian
aid
fernandez
told
reuters
and
they
came
charging
at
us
they
shot
innocent
people
who
were
in
their
homes
seven
of
the
injured
were
rushed
by
ambulance
to
a
hospital
in
the
brazilian
frontier
city
of
boa
vista
a
spokesman
for
the
state
governor
s
office
said
diosdado
cabello
one
of
the
most
prominent
figures
in
maduro
s
socialist
party
accused
the
civilians
involved
in
the
clash
of
being
violent
groups
directed
by
the
opposition
venezuelan
security
forces
have
executed
dozens
and
detained
hundreds
of
others
since
protests
broke
out
in
january
against
maduro
s
according
to
civil
rights
groups
antonio
guterres
met
venezuelan
foreign
minister
jorge
arreaza
in
new
york
on
friday
and
urged
the
venezuelan
authorities
not
to
use
lethal
force
against
demonstrators
spokesman
stephane
dujarric
said
asked
about
the
deaths
arreaza
told
reporters
the
armed
forces
would
never
take
disproportionate
action
against
its
own
people
our
armed
forces
are
known
for
their
the
special
envoy
for
venezuela
who
joined
regional
leaders
and
diplomats
in
cucuta
to
show
support
for
the
opposition
called
the
killings
a
crime
and
a
disgrace
what
do
we
do
if
the
government
of
maduro
the
former
government
of
maduro
does
not
fall
tomorrow
elliott
abrams
said
after
meeting
the
presidents
of
paraguay
and
chile
and
the
of
the
organization
of
american
states
we
continue
trying
to
bring
humanitarian
aid
to
the
people
of
china
which
along
with
russia
backs
maduro
warned
that
humanitarian
aid
should
not
be
forced
across
the
border
because
doing
so
could
lead
to
violence
the
bloodshed
contrasted
with
a
joyful
mood
at
branson
s
venezuela
aid
live
where
venezuelan
and
colombian
attendees
some
crying
waved
flags
and
chanted
freedom
under
a
baking
sun
is
it
too
much
to
ask
for
freedom
after
years
of
ignominy
of
a
populist
marxist
dictatorship
venezuelan
singer
jose
luis
el
puma
rodr√≠guez
asked
to
the
venezuelans
there
don
t
give
up
the
blood
that
has
been
spilled
was
not
in
vain
earlier
in
the
day
branson
held
a
news
conference
near
a
border
bridge
that
venezuelan
authorities
have
blocked
with
shipping
containers
what
we
re
hoping
is
that
the
authorities
in
venezuela
will
see
this
wonderful
peaceful
concert
and
that
the
soldiers
will
do
that
right
thing
branson
said
as
well
as
the
foreign
aid
stockpiled
in
cucuta
guaido
has
vowed
to
bring
in
aid
on
saturday
from
the
brazilian
town
of
boa
vista
and
the
dutch
caribbean
island
of
curacao
the
people
of
venezuela
are
not
begging
they
re
resisting
a
dictatorship
the
onslaught
of
oppression
guaido
told
a
news
conference
in
cucuta
after
the
concert
tomorrow
everyone
will
be
on
the
streets
demanding
the
entry
of
humanitarian
aid
thanking
the
world
for
this
unprecedented
brazil
said
on
friday
it
had
tonnes
of
food
and
medicine
ready
for
venezuela
but
only
one
truck
had
arrived
to
pick
it
up
before
the
border
was
closed
venezuela
s
borders
are
porous
however
and
supporters
could
attempt
to
bring
in
aid
outside
the
official
entry
points
guaido
s
move
to
assume
the
interim
presidency
and
international
backing
has
galvanized
venezuela
s
opposition
which
has
vowed
to
keep
protesting
until
maduro
steps
down
major
protests
in
and
waned
in
the
face
of
crackdowns
some
government
critics
are
concerned
it
will
take
more
than
pressure
to
force
maduro
to
step
down
the
truth
is
that
not
even
concerts
will
make
damned
maduro
leave
office
said
darwin
rendon
one
of
the
million
venezuelans
to
have
emigrated
since
to
find
work
he
sends
what
little
he
earns
selling
cigarettes
to
his
family
in
caracas

regime
is
