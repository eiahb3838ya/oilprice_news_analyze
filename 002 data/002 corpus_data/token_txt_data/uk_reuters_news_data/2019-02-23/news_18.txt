nigerian
president
muhammadu
buhari
s
hold
on
power
faces
a
strong
challenge
on
saturday
in
a
delayed
election
that
hinges
on
the
fate
of
the
economy
africa
s
biggest
the
presidential
vote
in
the
continent
s
top
oil
producer
and
most
populous
nation
is
too
close
to
call
between
buhari
and
the
main
opposition
candidate
atiku
abubakar
a
businessman
and
former
vice
president
who
leads
a
field
of
more
than
challengers
the
election
due
to
be
held
a
week
ago
was
postponed
around
five
hours
before
polling
stations
were
set
to
open
and
there
are
concerns
that
the
delay
may
hurt
turnout
the
electoral
commission
blamed
logistical
factors
for
the
delay
and
denied
political
pressure
was
behind
the
decision
presidential
elections
in
and
were
also
delayed
over
logistics
and
security
concerns
but
buhari
on
friday
urged
nigerians
to
go
out
and
vote
promising
that
there
would
be
adequate
security
for
the
ballot
the
boko
haram
militant
group
and
its
offshoot
islamic
state
in
west

province
have
carried
out
deadly
sporadic
raids
in
the
northeastern
borno
state
boko
haram
has
warned
people
not
to
vote
but
the
showdown
between
buhari
and
atiku
hinges
on
revamping
an
economy
struggling
to
recover
from
its
first
recession
in
years
which
it
slipped
into
in
as
crude
prices
crashed
and
militants
attacked
energy
facilities
in
the
niger
delta
crude
sales
make
up
percent
of
foreign
exchange
earnings
instability
is
a
rising
concern
but
a
weak
economy
is
being
felt
in
all
sectors
and
so
we
believe
it
will
be
the
preeminent
voter
concern
said
benedict
craven
analyst
at
the
economist
intelligence
unit
buhari
s
critics
say
his
focus
on
rooting
out
corruption
may
be
offset
by
his
handling
of
the
economy
despite
the
president
s
campaign
against
graft
there
have
not
been
any
significant
convictions
in
his
first
term
nearly
a
quarter
of
the
workforce
is
unemployed
much
higher
than
when
buhari
a
former
military
ruler
who
was
later
elected
president
took
over
in
the
cost
of
living
has
also
risen
rapidly
with
inflation
of
percent
in
january
just
short
of
a
high
reached
the
previous
month
buhari
has
said
the
economy
has
put
the
recession
behind
it
and
is
back
on
a
path
of
steady
growth
to
his
supporters
atiku
is
an
accomplished
businessman
with
the
credentials
needed
to
boost
growth
create
jobs
and
attract
foreign
investors
back
to
nigeria
atiku
has
promised
to
expand
the
role
of
the
private
sector
in
a
nation
of
nearly
million
people
saying
that
if
elected
he
would
aim
to
double
the
size
of
the
economy
to
billion
by
he
has
for
years
been
dogged
by
corruption
accusations
which
he
denies
critics
say
atiku
would
use
his
policies
to
enrich
himself
and
those
around
him
without
addressing
the
poverty
that
afflicts
most
nigerians
buhari

s
stronghold
the
number

people
to

the
