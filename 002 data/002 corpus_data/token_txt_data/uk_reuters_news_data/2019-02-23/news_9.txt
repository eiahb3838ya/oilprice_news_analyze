iran
said
on
saturday
it
had
many
options
to
neutralise
the
reimposition
of
sanctions
on
its
oil
exports
the
tasnim
news
agency
reported
adding
that
tehran
s
regional
influence
could
not
be
curbed
as
demanded
by
washington
apart
from
closing
strait
of
hormuz
we
have
other
options
to
stop
oil
flow
if
threatened
secretary
of
iran
s
supreme
national
security
council
ali
shamkhani
told
tasnim
iran
has
plans
in
place
that
will
neutralise
the
illegal
sanctions
against
iran
s
oil
exports
shamkhani
said
we
have
many
ways
to
sell
our
tensions
between
iran
and
the
united
states
increased
after
president
donald
trump
pulled
out
of
a
nuclear
deal
between
iran
and
six
world
powers
last
may
and
then
reimposed
sanctions
on
the
islamic
republic
the
restoration
of
sanctions
is
part
of
a
wider
effort
by
trump
to
force
iran
to
further
curb
its
nuclear
and
missile
programs
as
well
as
its
support
for
proxy
forces
in
yemen
syria
lebanon
and
other
parts
of
the
middle
east
washington
had
been
pushing
governments
to
cut
imports
of
iranian
oil
to
zero
but
fearing
a
price
spike
it
granted
waivers
to
eight
iranian
oil
buyers
when
the
sanctions
on
oil
imports
started
last
november
iranian
officials
have
threatened
to
disrupt
oil
shipments
from
the
gulf
countries
if
washington
tries
to
strangle
tehran
s
oil
exports
carrying
of
the
world
s
seaborne
oil
every
day
the
strait
of
hormuz
links
middle
east
crude
producers
to
key
markets
in
asia
pacific
europe
north
america
and
beyond
there
are
multiple
ways
to
make
that
blockage
of
hormuz
happen
we
hope
we
would
not
be
forced
to
use
them
shamkhani
said
iran
the
dominant
shi
ite
muslim
power
which
is
in
a
rivalry
with
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
states
other
sunni
arab
allies
has
been
president
bashar
s
most
supportive
ally
against
insurgents
throughout
the
nearly
syrian
civil
war
we
have
achieved
percent
of
iran
s
goals
in
syria
said
shamkhani
a
close
ally
of
iran
s
top
authority
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
there
will
be
important
developments
in
promoting
deterrence
capability
of
the
resistance
front
in
syria
said
shamkhani
when
asked
about
israel
s
possible
future
attacks
in
syria
according
to
tasnim
iran
often
refers
to
regional
countries
and
forces
opposed
to
israel
and
the
united
states
as
a
resistance
axis
israel
increasingly
concerned
that
its
enemy
iran
may
establish
a
military
presence
in
neighbouring
syria
says
it
has
carried
out
over
attacks
against
iranian
targets
in
syria
in
the
last
two
years
defying
israeli
threats
that
they
might
be
targeted
if
they
do
not
leave
the
country
iran
says
it
will
continue
to
provide
military
advisers
to
syria
for
as
long
as
necessary
in
support
of
assad
s
forces
iran
is
capable
of
confronting
any
military
threat
trump
and
israel
are
well
aware
of
iran
s
military
might
shamkhani
said
they
know
that
they
can
not
enter
a
war
with
iran
that
is
why
they
publicly
threaten
