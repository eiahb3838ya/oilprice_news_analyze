reported
a

fall
in

on

but
the
drop
was
not

bad
as

after
an

in

managing

peter

told
reporters
we
anticipate
it
will
actually
be
a
number
of
years
before
our
key
communities
in
the
highlands
area
get
back
to
some
form
of
normality
as
roads
and
schools
start
to
open
and
they
get
their
gardens
back
on
their
feet

are
all
back
on

but
will
take
around
six

he
said

broker
forecasts
of

production
costs
for
the

year
rose
to
per

from
a

earlier

underperforming

the

has
said
he
wants
to
finalise
an
agreement
on
the
lng
expansion
before
the
asia
pacific
economic
apec
summit
in

in
november
botten
said
there
still
is
a
lot
to
do
but
real
progress
is
being
made
botten
said
the
earthquake
aftermath
made
negotiations
tougher
with
a
backlash
against
the
project
from
locals
who
considered
the
quake
a
natural
reaction
to
gas
drilling
the
government
is
pressing
oil
search
exxon
and
total
for
better
fiscal
terms
for
the
expansion
than
the
original
png
lng
project
after
its
revenue
from
the
country
s
biggest
natural
resource
venture
was
less
than
expected
the
plant
started
exports
in
just
before
oil
prices
collapsed
we
all
understand
there
has
to
be
a
balance
of
rewards
for
all
parties
to
make
this
work
