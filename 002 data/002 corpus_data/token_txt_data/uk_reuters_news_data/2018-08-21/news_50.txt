u.s. tariffs cast a cloud over huawei's solar electronics launch
reuters
huawei
technology
co
s
coming
launch
of
a
control
device
is
expected
to
collide
with
new
trump
administration
tariffs
on
chinese
electronics
undermining
a
product
that
analysts
had
seen
as
challenging
rivals
on
pricing
the
chinese
company
best
known
for
its
smart
phones
and
telecommunications
equipment
has
developed
a
new
generation
of
solar
inverters
which
convert
manage
and
monitor
energy
produced
by
solar
panels
for
home
use
huawei
has
said
it
was
aiming
to
roll
out
the
product
called
fusionhome
in
the
united
states
before
the
end
of
the
summer
a
year
after
its
original
target
analysts
and
distributors
had
expected
it
to
knock
off
current
market
prices
of
similar
devices
costing
between
and
per
household
but
a
coming
percent
tariff
on
chinese
electronics
that
would
overturn
much
of
huawei
s
expected
price
advantage
may
have
stalled
talks
with
installers
and
distributors
said
analysts
and
research
firms
huawei
will
either
have
to
reduce
its
margins
or
raise
prices
they
said
potentially
benefiting
rival
producers
including
solaredge
and
enphase
energy
which
are
ramping
up
manufacturing
outside
china
huawei
declined
to
comment
on
tariffs
and
did
not
respond
to
detailed
questions
from
reuters
on
the
current
status
of
fusionhome
company
spokesman
joe
kelly
said
in
july
that
the
company
was
planning
to
introduce
the
new
product
to
its
partners
in
the
united
states
this
summer
and
that
the
timing
of
the
would
depend
on
those
distributors
the
percent
tariff
if
implemented
will
take
effect
and
analysts
covering
the
sector
say
it
will
affect
the
new
huawei
product
it
certainly
would
eat
into
profits
and
is
just
a
question
on
how
aggressive
huawei
wants
to
be
said
cowen

huawei
s
foray
into
the
residential
market
comes
after
panel
installations
fell
in
for
the
first
time
in
seven
years
gtm
research
recently
cut
its
forecast
for
residential
solar
market
installations
by
percent
to
gigawatts
of
four
major
solar
panel
makers
reuters
talked
to
only
vivint
solar
confirmed
it
was
considering
adding
huawei
s
inverter
to
its
lineup
sunpower
corp
and
tesla
s
solarcity
did
not
respond
to
reuters
requests
for
comment
a
sunrun
spokeswoman
said
the
company
welcomed
new
innovations
that
made
solar
energy
cheaper
and
more
accessible
a
percent
tariff
could
eat
up
the
margins
of
chinese
manufacturers
and
potentially
change
the
player
landscape
of
the
solar
inverter
market
