the

cpc
expects
to
pump
about
million
tonnes
of
cpc
blend
crude
oil
via
the
cpc
pipeline
this
year
down
from
the
previous
plan
for
million
tonnes
the
consortium
told
reuters
on
tuesday
we
expect
to
pump
around
million
tonnes
but
it
the
export
volume
of
course
depends
on
producers
cpc

on
a
daily
basis
cpc
blend
exports
will
be
percent
lower
than
under
the
previous
plan
reuters
calculations
show
the
original
plan
was
based
on
producers
annual
requests
cpc
said
but
shipped
volumes
can
be
affected
by
factors
such
as
maintenance
and
bad
weather
we
re
pragmatists
and
understand
that
the
maximum
volume
of
loadings
million
tonnes
is
unlikely
to
be
achieved
we
stay
in
contact
with
producers
and
plan
exports
monthly
and
quarterly
which
allows
us
to
make
corrections
to
the
export
schedule
according
to
the
latest
changes
cpc
told
reuters
preliminary
cpc
blend
loading
schedules
for
seen

for
suggest
cpc

not
yet
received
producers
requests
for
exports
in
lower
shipments
via
