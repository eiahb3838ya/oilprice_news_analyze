global
equity
markets
rose
on
tuesday
with
the
s
p
setting
a
new
record
high
as
strong
earnings
and
economic
growth
fueled
stocks
while
the
dollar
weakened
after
president
donald
trump
slammed
the
federal
reserve
for
raising

rates
the

rose
as
much
as

its

record
high
of

on
the

has
gained
over
percent
in
the
past
month
remarkably
even
at
this
point
a
new
record
and
on
the
verge
of
being
the
longest
bull
market
in
history
it
s
got
some
room
to
run
said
david
kelly
chief
global
strategist
at
jpmorgan
asset
management
in
new
york
the
s
p
was
poised
to
mark
another
major
milestone
on
wednesday
when
the
bull
market
turns
days
old
making
it
the
longest
such
streak
in
the
eyes
of
many
market
watchers
trump
said
in
an
interview
with
reuters
on
monday
that
he
was
not
thrilled
with
the
fed
under
his
appointee
chairman
jerome
powell
for
raising
rates
and
that
the
central
bank
should
do
more
to
boost
the
economy
trump
also
accused
china
and
europe
of
manipulating
their
currencies
the
euro
is
down
about
percent
so
far
this
year
against
the
dollar
while
the
chinese
yuan
has
slipped
percent
this
year
against
the
greenback
it
would
appear
that
trump
would
like
to
keep
the
dollar
a
little
on
the
weak
side
in
order
to
remain
competitive
said
cmc
markets
chief
markets
analyst
david
madden
the
dollar
index
which
tracks
performance
against
a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
fell
percent
on
tuesday
and
has
slid
almost
percent
over
the
past
four
days
its
worst
such
run
since
late
march
the
dollar
s
weakness
eased
pressure
on
emerging
markets
many
of
which
have
struggled
in
recent

over
turkey
sparked

lifted
both
equities
and
shares
in
europe
operating
earnings
have
gained
more
than
percent
in
the
first
two
quarters
which
kelly
said
is
truly
extraordinary
in
the
bull
market
s
tenth
year
this
is
about
to
become
the
longest
bull
market
in
history
because
it
s
the
most
hated
bull
market
it
s
important
to
realize
that
the
longevity
has
been
helped
by
the
fact
people
have
been
skeptical
all
the
way
along
he
said
some
remain
skeptical
as
equities
are
relatively
expensive
a
multiple
of
will
make
it
hard
for
stocks
to
move
materially
higher
in
the
near
future
with
earnings
comparisons
getter
tougher
and
earnings
growth
slowing
said
michael
geraghty
equity
strategist
at
cornerstone
capital
group
there
s
not
a
whole
lot
of
reasons
for
stocks
in
aggregate
to
move
materially
higher
or
lower
anytime
soon
he

the

trump
who
criticized
the

he
was
a
candidate
said
in
the
interview
other

from
their
central

the
united

not
