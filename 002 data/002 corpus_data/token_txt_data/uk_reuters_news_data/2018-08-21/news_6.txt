such
as
certain

dono
boestami
head
of
the
estate
crop
fund
told
reporters
on
monday
the
agency
is
prepared
to
provide
incentives
to
support
the
biodiesel
plan
the
estate
crop
fund
collects
levies
from
palm
oil
exporters
and
the
proceeds
are
used
to
finance
government
palm
oil
programmes
such
as
biodiesel
and
crop
replanting
boestami
said
the
agency
collected
trillion
rupiah
million
in
levies
last
year
and
provided
subsidies
on
million
kilolitres
of
biodiesel
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
fund
collected
trillion
rupiah
in
fees
and
subsidised
million
kilolitres
of
biodiesel
indonesia
currently
imports
around
barrels
per
day
of
crude
oil
and
a
roughly
similar
amount
of
refined
products
which
makes
the
economy
vulnerable
to
the
increases
in
global
crude
prices
that
have
occurred
since
last
year
with
the
country
s
current
account
deficit
estimated
to
grow
by
billion
in
the
plan
is
to
cut
diesel
imports
by
mandating
that
all
diesel
consumers
including
power
plants
and
railways
use
biodiesel
that
contains
percent
typically
palm
oil
officials
estimate
biodiesel
consumption
will
rise
to
between
million
to
million
kilolitres
in
from
million
kilolitres
this
year
and
save
indonesia
around
billion
per
year
palm
oil
oversupply
will
be
absorbed
through
biodiesel
programme
because
at
the
moment
biodiesel
production
utilization
is
only
percent
of
annual
installed
capacity
boestami
said
separately
indonesia
s
energy
ministry
planned
to
