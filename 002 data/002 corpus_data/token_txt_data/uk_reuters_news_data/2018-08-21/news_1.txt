update 4-trump's epa unveils weaker alternative to obama power plant rule
reuters
the
trump
administration
on
tuesday
proposed
replacing
a
signature
policy
to
combat
climate
change
with
a
weaker
plan
that
would
let
states
write
their
own
rules
on
power
plants
prompting
critics
to
warn
of
dire
environmental
and
health
consequences
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
proposal
would
require
states
to
submit
plans
for
improving
efficiency
of
power
plants
the
federal
government
will
set
carbon
emission
guidelines
but
states
will
have
the
leeway
to
set
standards
taking
into
account
a
facility
s
age
and
the
cost
of
upgrades
the
rule
also
could
allow
power
plant
owners
to
sidestep
costly
permits
for
those
improvements
the
era
of
top
down
federal
mandates
is
over
epa
acting
administrator
andrew
wheeler
said
on
a
conference
call
the
attorneys
general
of
virginia
and
new
york
quickly
criticized
the
epa
announcement
and
said
they
would
sue
to
block
the
rule
if
it
becomes
law
epa
projected
the
new
plan
would
result
in
million
a
year
in
economic
benefits
and
reduce
retail
power
prices
by
up
to
percent
by
yet
documents
released
on
tuesday
showed
the
epa
estimated
carbon
dioxide
emissions
would
be
higher
than
under
the
obama
policy
while
premature
deaths
hospital
admissions
asthma
cases
and
school
absence
days
could
be
higher
by
the
agency
s
assistant
administrator
for
the
office
of
air
and
radiation
bill
wehrum
said
that
under
the
new
rule
power
sector
emissions
would
be
similar
to
the
goals
set
under
the
obama
administration
s
clean
power
plan
cpp
because
of
how
much
the
industry
has
already
shifted
toward
cleaner
fuels
things
have
changed
a
lot
since
the
cpp
was
put
in
place
wehrum
said
to
reporters
on
the
epa
conference
call
the
industry
continues
to
transform
before
our
very
the
administration
s
affordable
clean
energy
rule
is
limited
in
its
scope
to
plants
the
plan
which
has
been
put
on
hold
by
the
supreme
court
set
overall
goals
for
each
state
using
a
series
of
different
measures
epa
forecast
that
under
the
new
rule
coal
production
would
rise
by
up
to
percent
by
california
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
asked
in
an
interview
whether
his
state
would
sue
to
block
the
plan
said
we
re
moving
in
that
direction
but
would
see
the
administrative
process
through
we
think
that
there
is
a
strong
case
to
be
made
that
they
are
violating
the
very
laws
they
are
supposed
to
enforce
becerra
said
epa
s
proposal
is
open
for
a
public
comment
period
with
a
final
rule
expected
later
this
year
the
effort
to
the
plan
is
the
latest
move
by
trump
administration
to
roll
back
environmental
rules
put
in
place
by
obama
trump
who
has
scheduled
a
rally
on
tuesday
in
state
west
virginia
has
vowed
to
end
what
he
termed
the
war
on
coal
and
boost
domestic
fossil
fuels
production
environmental
groups
warned
the
focus
on
improving
efficiency
of
generators
could
raise
overall
carbon
emissions
a
coal
plant
that
operates
more
efficiently
may
be
called
upon
to
run
more
hours
increasing
the
total
amount
of
emitted
overall
lissa
lynch
an
attorney
for
the
natural
resources
defense
council
said
in
a
statement
the
cpp
which
obama
s
epa
finalized
in
sought
to
reduce
emissions
from
power
plants
to
percent
below
levels
by
the
supreme
court
put
the
brakes
on
it
in
after
states
sued
the
epa
saying
it
had
exceeded
its
legal
reach
in
many
states
the
cpp
s
limits
on
emissions
have
already
been
met
because
the
cost
of
generating
power
from
natural
gas
and
renewable
energy
like
wind
and
solar
is
cheaper
than
coal
an
epa
study
forecast
that
compliance
costs
relative
to
the
cpp
would
be
slightly
lower
or
higher
depending
on
the
assumed
cost
of
making
efficiency
improvements
to
the
plants
that
is
because
the
electricity
sector
has
already
become
far
less
carbon
intensive
in
recent
years
