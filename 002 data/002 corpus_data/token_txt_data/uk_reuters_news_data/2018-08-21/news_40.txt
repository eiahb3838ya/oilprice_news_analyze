critical
comments
by
president
donald
trump
about
the
country
s
central
bank
held
back
some
stocks
on
tuesday
while
the
dollar
fell
for
the
fourth
consecutive
day
in
its
worst
spell
since
march
in
an
exclusive
interview
with
reuters
trump
said
late
on
monday
he
was
not
thrilled
with
the
federal
reserve
under
his
own
appointee
chairman
jerome
powell
for
raising
interest
rates
and
said
the
fed
should
do
more
to
help
him
to
boost
the
economy
american
presidents
have
rarely
criticized
the
fed
in
recent
decades
because
its
independence
has
been
seen
as
important
for
economic
stability
the
fed
is
independent
in
setting
monetary
policy
and
markets
were
spooked
by
yet
another
comment
from
donald
trump
criticising
higher
interest
rates
said
artjom
hatsaturjants
an
analyst
at
accendo
markets
the
dollar
index
which
tracks
performance
against
a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
fell
percent
on
tuesday
it
has
now
fallen
percent
in
the
last
four
days
its
worst
such
run
since
late
march
the
stoxx
index
rose
percent
in
early
trade
on
tuesday
with
uk
stocks
underperforming
the
ftse
which
derives
a
large
portion
of
its
revenues
in
the
united
states
and
so
benefits
from
dollar
strength
was
flat
the
dollar
s
weakness
took
the
pressure
off
many
emerging
market
currencies
that
have
struggled
in
recent
weeks
as
worries
over
turkey
precipitated
a
across
the
globe
the
chinese
yuan
rose
by
percent
to
per
dollar
the
currency
was
on
track
for
its
fourth
session
of
gains
pulling
further
away
from
its
weakest
since
january
marked
last
week
the
yuan
had
weakened
to
a
low
against
the
dollar
earlier
this
month
amid
concerns
over
the
country
s
economic
growth
trade
war
worries
and
a
broad
rally
by
the
dollar
in
his
reuters
interview
trump
also
accused
china
of
manipulating
its
currency
and
said
there
was
little
hope
of
progress
in
the
ongoing
trade
dispute
between
the
two
countries
in
talks
due
this
week
other
emerging
currencies
including
the
south
african
rand
thai
baht
mexican
peso
hungarian
forint
polish
zloty
and
indian
rupee
were
all
higher
by
to
percent
against
the
dollar
commodities
that
are
priced
in
dollars
and
so
benefit
from
any
weakness
were
also
higher
across
the
board
base
metals
prices
rose
with
london
copper
climbing
for
a
second
day
and
crossing
the
