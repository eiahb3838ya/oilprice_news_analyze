british
oilfield
services
firm
wood
plc
hit
the
top
end
of
its
forecasts
for
profit
in
an
improving
global
oil
market
while
warning
its
ability
to
raise
prices
was
still
limited
to
buoyant
shale
markets
shares
in
wood
rose
percent
initially
topping
gainers
on
the
midcap
ftse
after
it
also
raised
its
prediction
of
from
its
takeover
of
smaller
rival
amec
foster
last
october
the
company
has
seen
demand
for
services
recover
in
its
core
oil
and
gas
market
over
the
past
two
years
as
prices
of
crude
tripled
from
lows
ending
a
period
of
aggressive
by
producers
but
chief
financial
officer
david
kemp
told
reuters
that
improvement
was
still
only
slowly
showing
up
in
wood
s
ability
to
increase
prices
with
shale
markets
roughly
to
months
ahead
of
the
rest
of
the
business
in
we
don
t
expect
that
pricing
uplift
outside
of
shale
whereas
when
we
get
part
way
through
the
cycle
we
expect
pricing
more
generally
to
improve
he
said
revenue
has
grown
over
percent
in
the
first
half
we
see
that
momentum
continuing
into
the
second
half
and
that
creates
the
right
ambition
for
pricing
improvement
in
the
wood
which
operates
in
more
than
countries
expects
to
see
a
further
in
activity
including
higher
spending
by
international
oil
and
gas
explorers
from
integrating
amec
foster
which
it
bought
last
year

now
expected
to
be

earlier
forecast

million

the

stuck
to
its
forecast
and
said
it
was
on
track
to
deliver

ebita
growth
in
line
with

expectations
a
slight
disappointment
is
that
wg
wood
has
not
raised
ebita
expectations
for
on
the
back
of
such
strong
topline
growth
jpmorgan
analysts
said
in
a
note
revenue
rose
percent
to
billion
as
demand
for
its
oilfield
services
and
products
picked
up

higher
spending
by

producers
after
