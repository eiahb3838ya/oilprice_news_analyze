update 4-u.s. lawmakers seek to impose more sanctions on 'menace' russia
washington
reuters
lawmakers
pushed
for
more
aggressive
steps
to
counteract
the
russian
menace
on
tuesday
despite
trump
administration
officials
insisting
current
sanctions
were
having
an
effect
and
vowing
to
impose
more
economic
pain
if
moscow
does
not
change
its
behaviour
president
donald
trump
has
repeatedly
said
he
would
like
better
ties
with
moscow
but
although
he
met
russian
president
vladimir
putin
last
month
relations
between
the
two
countries
have
been
further
strained
members
of
congress
where
both
chambers
are
controlled
by
trump
s
fellow
republicans
have
called
for
more
action
including
introducing
new
sanctions
legislation
from
hell
to
punish
russia
for
its
annexation
of
crimea
involvement
in
syria
s
civil
war
and
cyber
attacks
seeking
to
influence
elections
they
held
three
hearings
related
to
russia
on
tuesday
in
the
banking
and
foreign
relations
committees
and
a
judiciary
subcommittee
lawmakers
chastised
administration
officials
for
doing
too
little
to
change
russian
behaviour
both
republicans
and
democrats
have
criticized
trump
particularly
after
his
helsinki
summit
with
putin
last
month
for
failing
to
stand
up
to
moscow
and
not
fully
enacting
a
sweeping
sanctions
law
passed
nearly
unanimously
a
year
ago
it
s
not
often
that
congress
acts
together
in
such
a
strong
manner
said
republican
senator
mike
crapo
chairman
of
the
banking
committee
which
oversees
sanctions
policy
but
then
russia
is
a
menace
on
so
many
different
levels
today
that
congress
can
be
compelled
to
act
with
a
single
senator
bob
menendez
noted
that
the
administration
has
not
designated
any
new
oligarchs
for
sanctions
since
april
and
has
eased
some
sanctions
we
re
told
to
judge
the
administration
by
its
actions
and
not
the
president
s
words
but
these
actions
seem
to
be
more
aligned
with
the
president
s
accommodating
and
disturbing
rhetoric
than
a
tougher
approach
to
the
kremlin
menendez
said
at
the
banking
hearing
menendez
vowed
that
congress
will
act
with
or
without
the
administration
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
told
reporters
later
tuesday
there
was
strong
interest
in
legislation
to
punish
moscow
although
he
said
chances
were
probably
pretty
slim
such
a
measure
would
come
up
for
a
vote
before
the
congressional
elections
microsoft
corp
said
late
monday
that
hackers
linked
to
the
kremlin
sought
to
launch
cyber
attacks
on
the
senate
and
conservative
american
think
tanks
warning
of
broader
attacks
ahead
of
the
november
vote
the
kremlin
rejected
the
microsoft
allegations
moscow
has
repeatedly
denied
attempting
to
influence
elections
including
the
presidential
vote
that
brought
trump
into
office
intelligence
agencies
have
concluded
that
russia
interfered
in
seeking
to
tilt
the
vote
in
trump
s
favour
and
backed
by
lawmakers
warned
that
more
would
come
in
upcoming
elections
america
is
under
cyber
attack
we
re
beginning
to
act
but
not
quick
enough
and
not
forcefully
enough
republican
senator
lindsey
graham
said
at
the
judiciary
subcommittee
hearing
administration
officials
insisted
existing
sanctions
were
hitting
russia
though
russia
s
malign
activities
continue
we
believe
its
adventurism
undoubtedly
has
been
checked
by
the
knowledge
that
we
can
bring
much
more
economic
pain
to
bear
using
our
powerful
range
of
authorities
and
that
we
will
not
hesitate
to
do
so
if
its
conduct
does
not
demonstrably
and
significantly
change
senior
treasury
official
sigal
mandelker
told
the
banking
panel
the
treasury
department
imposed
new
sanctions
on
two
russians
one
russian
company
and
one
slovakian
firm
over
actions
it
said
helped
another
russian
company
avoid
penalties
over
activities
the
united
states
also
announced
sanctions
on
russian
shipping
over
violations
of
restrictions
on
north
korea
assistant
secretary
of
state
wess
mitchell
told
foreign
relations
that
concern
about
sanctions
has
cost
russia
to
billion
billion
in
arms
deals
mitchell
also
said
foreign
direct
investment
in
russia
has
fallen
by
percent
since
which
is
a
pretty
stunning
i
think
this
administration
has
been
clear
that
we
are
prepared
to
take
additional
steps
mitchell
said
there
is
an
escalatory
ladder
to
sanctions
we
are
aware
of
what
additional
steps
would
be
needed
to
make
an
even
bigger
in
an
interview
with
reuters
on
monday
trump
said
he
would
only
consider
lifting
sanctions
against
russia
if
it
were
to
do
something
positive
for
the
united
states
for
instance
in
syria
or
in
ukraine
