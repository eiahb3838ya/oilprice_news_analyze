in
a

on

buoyed
by
the

though
the
trade
dispute
between
washington
and
beijing
kept
traders
and
analysts
cautious
oil

strength
in
the

caught
many

by
surprise
as

when

maintenance
activities
the

widened

for

the
syncrude
facility
has
since
begun
ramping
up
light
oil
production
which
surprised
market
participants
because
it
was
earlier
than
expected
and
caused
them
to
short

americas
oil
prices
have
gained
in
the
last
two
sessions
following
weeks
of
declines
on
the
prospect
of
lower
oil
supply
from
iran
the
united
states
is
trying
to
halt
iranian
oil
exports
in
an
effort
to
force
tehran
to
negotiate
a
new
nuclear
agreement
and
to
curb
its
influence
in
the
middle
east
however
the
full
impact
of
the
iran
sanctions
are
unclear
while
most
of
europe
s
energy
firms
are
likely
to
fall
in
line
with
washington
china
has
indicated
that
it
will
continue
to
buy
iranian
oil
bnp
paribas
said
it
expected
oil
production
from
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
of
which
iran
is
a
member
to
fall
from
an
average
of
million
barrels
per
day
in
to
million
in
however
oil
exports
from
southern
iraq
are
on
course
to
hit
another
record
high
this
month
two
industry
sources
said
adding
to
signs
that
opec
s
producer
is
following
through
on
the
group
s
agreement
to
raise
output
washington
on
monday
offered
million
barrels
of
sour
crude
from
its
strategic
petroleum
reserve
for
delivery
from
to
the
released
oil
could
offset
expected
supply
shortfalls
from
the
sanctions
against
iran
the
market
also
continued
to
eye
the
trade
dispute
which
threatens
to
undermine
global
growth
and
therefore
consumption
of
industrial
commodities
a
chinese
delegation
is
due
in
washington
this
week
to
try
to
resolve
the
dispute
but
president
donald
trump
told
reuters
on
monday
he
does
not
expect
much
progress
and
that
resolving
the
disagreement
will
take
the
fact
that
there
are
negotiations
beginning
that
probably
ultimately
come
to
some
resolution
on
this
are
