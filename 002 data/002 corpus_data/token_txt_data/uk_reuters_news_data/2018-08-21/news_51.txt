on

president
donald
trump
said
that
china
was
manipulating
its

to
make
up
for
having
to
pay
tariffs
imposed
by
washington
on
some
imports
from

this

ongoing
negotiation
is
good
news
and
that
s
what
the
market
is
riding
on
at
this
stage
but
a
sustainable
agreement
to
end
this
tension
still
seems
unlikely
at

his

at
the

s
rate
hikes
saying
the

should
do
more
to

him
boost

the

looked
to
have
strengthened
its

stance
at
the
