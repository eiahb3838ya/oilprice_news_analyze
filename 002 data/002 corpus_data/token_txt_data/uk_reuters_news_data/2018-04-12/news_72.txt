with
china
after
a
report

ministers
were
being
denied
chinese
visas
relations
between
australia
and
its
largest
trading
partner
have
been
strained
over
the
past
year
partly
over
australian
concern
about
rising
chinese
influence
which
led
to
the
introduction
of
legislation
banning
foreign
political
donations
the
australian
financial
review
citing
unidentified
sources
said
this
week
china
had
denied
visas
to
australian
government
officials
to
attend
a
major
annual
trade
show
denting
close
economic
ties
between
the
two
countries
there
s
clearly
been
some
tension
in
the
relationship
following
the
introduction
of
our
legislation
about
foreign
interference
but
i
m
very
confident
that
any
misunderstandings
will
be
resolved

influence
and
warned
of
foreign
powers
unprecedented
and
increasingly
sophisticated
attempts
to
influence
the
political
process
the
australian
legislation
which
is
expected
to
be
passed
soon
also
requires
the
registration
of
lobbyists
working
for
foreign
countries
china
bought
a
billion
billion
worth
of
australian
goods
and
services
last
year
but
trade
ties
are
only
one
side
of
a
delicate
balancing
act
for
australia
whose
unshakeable
security
relationship
with
the
united
states
has
limited
how
close
it
gets
with
china
encouraged
by
the
united

has
sharpened
its
criticism
of
china

activities
in
the
