shell sees no risk of "stranded assets" as reserves life shrinks
london
reuters
royal
dutch
shell
said
on
thursday
it
saw
little
risk
of
having
stranded
assets
in
its
portfolio
as
the
world
shifts
to
low
carbon
energy
because
the
oil
major
will
have
of
its
current
oil
and
gas
reserves
extracted
before
anyway
shell
has
one
of
the
lowest
reserves
life
ratio
among
its
peers
and
last
year
it
saw
reserves
plunging
to
new
lows
after
divesting
a
large
number
of
assets
the
major
now
sits
on
billion
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
down
from
billion
at
the
end
of
and
enough
to
sustain
the
current
annual
production
of
billion
barrels
for
less
than
nine
years
reserves
life
has
long
been
one
of
the
key
metrics
monitored
by
investors
to
assess
oil
firms
future
resilience
long
reserve
life
was
especially
important
during
years
when
oil
was
seen
as
a
finite
asset
and
analysts
predominantly
believed
in
the
theory
of
peak
oil
suggesting
the
world
will
soon
run
out
of
good
oil
reserves
but
as
the
united
states
the
world
s
largest
oil
consumer
discovered
at
the
start
of
this
decade
it
had
abundant
reserves
of
shale
oil
and
as
demand
patterns
also
began
to
shift
toward
greener
energy
the
peak
oil
theory
faded
instead
it
was
replaced
by
a
peak
demand
theory
suggesting
oil
consumption
will
plateau
and
start
declining
soon
due
to
electric
vehicles
while
large
quantities
of
oil
will
not
be
produced
and
remain
stranded
under
the
ground
in
such
circumstances
having
a
short
reserve
life
arguably
makes
more
strategic
sense
as
it
allows
companies
to
adjust
faster
to
quickly
changing
consumption
patterns
shell
said
its
assessments
indicated
a
low
risk
of
stranded
assets
in
the
current
portfolio
as
of
december
shell
estimates
that
around
percent
of
its
current
proved
oil
and
gas
reserves
will
be
produced
by
and
only
percent
after
that
time
it
said
it
said
it
was
confident
it
would
thrive
through
potential
changes
in
the
energy
system
to
while
growing
new
businesses
to
reduce
costs
and
improve
emissions
the
company
is
expanding
in
the
power
market
this
includes
investments
in
areas
such
as
wind
generation
in
the
netherlands
supplying
power
to
retail
customers
in
the
uk
and
offering
hydrogen
refuelling
and
longer
term
there
is
great
uncertainty
in
how
the
energy
transition
will
unfold
but
shell
believes
its
strategic
flexibility
will
allow
it
to
adapt
in
step
with
out
of
shell
s
total
proved
reserves
of
billion
barrels
oil
constitutes
billion
synthetic
canadian
crude
another
billion
barrels
while
the
rest
is
natural
gas
shell
has
previously
announced
ambition
to
reduce
net
carbon
footprint
of
the
energy
products
it
sells
by
around
half
by
the
plan
is
fairly
unique
for
the
industry
as
it
covers
not
only
emissions
from
the
production
of
energy
products
but
also
those
from
the
consumption
of
shell
s
products
by
its
customers
