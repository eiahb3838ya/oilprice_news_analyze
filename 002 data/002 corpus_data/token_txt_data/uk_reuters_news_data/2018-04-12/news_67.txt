feature-chocolate forests: can cocoa help save the amazon?
new
brazil
reuters
for
years
valdomiro
facchi
has
made
a
living
ranching
on
land
carved
from
the
amazon
rainforest
he
s
a
small
player
in
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
environmental
disasters
but
now
that
his
cattle
have
trampled
the
pastures
to
dust
and
new
laws
prevent
him
from
clearing
fresh
land
he
has
to
find
new
income
i
want
to
diversify
said
the
old
rancher
outlining
plans
to
plant
cocoa
trees
on
his
hectare
plot
in
brazil
s
para
state
i
want
to
have
the
cocoa
income
when
profit
from
cattle
ranching
facchi
illustrates
a
trend
that
is
turning
damaged
parts
of
the
amazon
basin
green
again
and
creating
an
usual
alliance
between
the
agriculture
industry
and
conservationists
brazil
s
cattle
ranchers
are
planting
cocoa
on
their
pasture
with
financial
support
from
international
environmental
groups
that
s
a
big
change
for
decades
ranchers
have
been
the
engine
of
in
the
amazon
rainforest
that
has
rendered
an
area
nearly
the
size
of
spain
treeless
environmentalists
have
argued
the
practice
destroys
wildlife
habitat
and
undermines
the
planet
s
ability
to
absorb
carbon
dioxide
that
causes
global
warming
besides
being
a
means
of
avoiding
deforestation
cocoa
plantations
favour
the
local
regional
and
national
economy
the
international
environmental
group
the
nature
conservancy
said
on
its
website
the
young
trees
will
also
bring
change
to
global
cocoa
markets
brazil
s
national
association
of
the
cocoa
processing
industry
aipc
expects
the
surge
in
planting
to
help
double
the
country
s
output
of
the
raw
material
in
chocolate
by
to
tonnes
a
year
that
increase
would
raise
global
output
by
about
percent
the
renewed
planting
could
make
brazil
one
of
the
world
s
top
three
cocoa
growers
again
after
the
sector
was
decimated
in
the
by
a
crop
fungus
called
witches
broom
conservationists
and
cocoa
industry
representatives
expect
the
trend
to
help
mitigate
the
effects
of
that
has
ripped
some
square
kilometres
from
the
amazon
rain
forest
since
the
fifty
percent
of
cocoa
production
growth
will
come
from
the
amazon
said
eduardo
bastos
executive
director
of
the
aipc
calling
the
cocoa
farms
there
chocolate
green
groups
like
the
nature
conservancy
and
the
amazon
fund
have
helped
finance
new
cocoa
plantations
the
amazon
fund
which
was
set
up
by
brazil
s
government
and
takes
international
donations
to
combat
deforestation
has
poured
million
reais
million
in
grants
into
the
crop
nearly
square
kilometres
of
degraded
cattle
pasture
in
brazil
has
been
transformed
into
cocoa
plantations
already
according
to
the
aipc
s
bastos
cocoa
planting
is
driven
mainly
by
new
limits
on
the
cattle
industry
that
have
changed
the
financial
incentives
for
ranchers
in
the
amazon
pasture
can
become
degraded
in
as
little
as
three
years
if
not
managed
properly
making
it
hard
to
raise
a
thriving
herd
without
new
acreage
brazil
in
passed
a
law
that
allows
landowners
to
clear
only
percent
of
their
property
in
the
amazon
and
requires
some
landowners
to
replant
depleted
areas
that
law
aims
to
curb
deforestation
which
peaked
in
at
a
pace
of
square
km
per
year
in
brazilian
amazon
lost
square
km
of
rainforest
compared
to
ranching
cocoa
can
provide
income
from
a
relatively
small
plot
with
no
need
for
constant
expansion
the
profits
can
be
up
to
five
times
better
said
eduardo
trevisan
gonçalves
project
manager
at
brazil
s
imaflora
an
environmental
group
that
did
a
study
comparing
income
from
cattle
and
cocoa
in
the
region
the
benefits
extend
to
the
environment
cocoa
plantations
can
imitate
natural
forests
helping
to
restore
native
plant
and
wildlife
species
boosting
water
resources
and
absorbing

dioxide
goncalves
said
it
is
a
perennial

he
said
it
will
stay
there
for
funding
from
environmental
groups
comes
with
guidelines
intended
to
boost
the
ecological
benefits
of
the
plantations
according
to
josé
garcia
a
farmer
in
the
central
pará
state
who
is
receiving
a
grant
from
the
amazon
fund
under
the
terms
he
said
he
will
have
to
plant
cocoa
alongside
other
taller
native
species
such
as
mahogany
and
ipê
it
is
recommended
that
cocoa
be
planted
with
other
trees
taller
ones
to
benefit
from
the
shade
he
said
at
his
farm
in
medicilândia
in
para
state
evidence
of
the
shift
is
everywhere
in
the
medicilândia
region
where
barren
pastures
have
given
way
to
shady
plantations
of
cocoa
trees
bearing
yellow
and
ruby
pods

brazil
is
an

heavyweight
among
the
world
s
top
growers
of
soybeans
corn
sugar

and
oranges
but
it
dropped
from
being
no
in
cocoa
in
the
early
after
witches
broom
slashed
its
production
in
para
state
however
witches
broom
rarely
survives
long
enough
to
damage
trees
the
fungus
requires
moist
conditions
and
largely
dies
off
during
the
annual
dry
season
as
a
result
cocoa
tree
yields
in
para
are
nearly
double
the
global
average
said
bastos
of
the
aipc
there
is
some
evidence
brazil
could
absorb
some
of
this
extra
production
