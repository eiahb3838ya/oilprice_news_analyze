buyers
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
have
grown
fat
and
lazy
on
expectations
of
a
surplus
of
the
fuel
and
they
now
risk
a
shortage
in
the
early
years
of
the
next
decade
there
s
no
surprise
that
this
was
the
view
of
a
lng
project
developer
expressed
at
this
week
s
lng
asia
pacific
congress
hosted
in
singapore
by
ibc
the
perspective
of
buyers
was
somewhat
different
with
some
recognising
that
prior
forecasts
of
a
large
surplus
were
unlikely
to
materialise
given
rising
demand
in
several
asian
countries
that
are
new
to
the
lng
market
but
the
common
theme
among
those
building
import
terminals
and
associated
infrastructure
was
that
lng
producers
should
participate
in
developing
markets
otherwise
the
anticipated
surge
in
demand
may
not
occur
they
need
to
have
skin
in
the
game
was
how
one
developer
of
an
import
terminal
put
it
the
conference
was
held
under
chatham
house
rules
meaning
information
may
be
disseminated
but
can
not
be
attributed
to
individual
participants
there
are
at
least
lng
import
terminals
being
planned
or
developed
in
south
and
southeast
asia
the
region
that
along
with
china
provides
the
bulk
of
the
optimism
for
lng
demand
in
the
next
decade
but
the
nature
of
these
projects
and
the
associated
infrastructure
may
give
some
pause
for
thought
to
those
who
take
the
view
that
this
is
future
demand
that
will
eat
up
any
lng
surplus
pakistan
has
plans
to
build
new
import
capacity
of
million
tonnes
per
annum
double
its
current
capacity
but
this
will
be
developed
largely
by
private
operators
the
market
for
new
lng
in
pakistan
is
also
dependent
on
associated
infrastructure
such
as
building
residential
connections
in
new
housing
estates
and
ensuring
that
power
plants
are
built
to
replace
inefficient
and
increasingly
costly
generators
in
india
additional
lng
is
mainly
targeted
at
industrial
and
residential
users
as
well
as
the
fertilizer
industry
and
again
installing
the
associated
infrastructure
to
distribute
the
lng
becomes
the
key
with
governments
across
south
and
southeast
asia
finding
it
increasingly
beyond
their
budgets
to
fund
all
the
required
infrastructure
it
will
fall
to
the
private
sector
to
stump
up
the
money
even
china
which
boosted
lng
demand
by
percent
last
year
will
rely
on
smaller
companies
to
boost
demand
in
coming
years
with
most
of
the
planned
import
capacity
being
developed
by
operators
outside
the
majors
lng
importers
want
producers
to
help
and
even
develop
retail
brands
much
as
international
oil
companies
built
up
distribution
and
retail
networks
for
products
such
as
gasoline
and
diesel
while
there
is
interest
among
lng
producers
and
trading
houses
to
help
develop
import
facilities
in
emerging
asian
buyers
the
interest
often
stops
at
the
terminal
and
developing
the
actual
infrastructure
is
left
to
domestic
operators
this
raises
the
possibility
of
stranded
assets
being
developed
whereby
import
facilities
mainly
floating
storage
and
units
fsrus
are
built
and
deployed
but
the
ability
to
distribute
the
natural
gas
is
lacking
even
if
the
demand
is
present
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
there
is
the
emerging
risk
that
lng
supply
may
be
insufficient
by
the
middle
of
the
next
decade
largely
because
buyers
have
been
on
strike
the
doubling
of
lng
capacity
in
the
period
from
to
created
by
a
wave
of
new
projects
mainly
in
australia
and
the
united
states
led
to
a
in
buyer
behaviour
no
longer
were
asia
s
lng
consumers
willing
to
enter
into
and
destination
restricted
contracts
instead
they
wanted
or
even
spot
deals
with
prices
linked
to
natural
gas
benchmarks
such
as
the
henry
hub
the
contracts
that
were
a
feature
of
the
market
helped
underpin
the
financing
needed
to
develop
new
capacity
and
the
shift
in
the
market
was
understandably
accompanied
by
a
sharp
drop
in
final
investment
decisions
for
new
ventures
lng
buyers
have
for
the
past
few
years
been
comfortable
with
the
view
of
a
supply
surplus
but
now
risk
a
rush
for
deals
just
like
patrons
at
a
pub
jostle
at
the
bar
as
last
drinks
are
called
the
most
likely
way
to
resolve
the
differences
in
perspective
between
buyers
and
sellers
is
for
lng
producers
to
accept
that
they
may
have
to
partner
more
with
their
customers
while
accepting
flexible
and
smaller
contracts
buyers
will
have
to
realise
that
they
no
longer
hold
the
whip
hand
and
will
have
to
start
committing
to
deals
to
boost
supply
in
their
own
interests
and
financiers
such
as
banks
and
development
agencies
also
have
to
adjust
their
thinking
as
the
old
world
of
a
few
major
buyers
committing
to
deals
in
order
to
underpin
a
new
lng
plant
is
now
gone
instead
the
new
order
is
likely
to
be
projects
will
sign
up
numerous
customers
to
shorter
deals
for
lower
volumes
