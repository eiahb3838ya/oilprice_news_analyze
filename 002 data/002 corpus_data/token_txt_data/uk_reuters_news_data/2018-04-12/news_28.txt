paris
april
reuters
france
has
proof
the
syrian
government
carried
out
a
chemical
weapons
attack
last
week
and
will
decide
whether
to
strike
back
when
all
the
necessary
information
has
been
gathered
president
emmanuel
macron
said
on
thursday
france
is
expected
to
join
the
united
states
and
britain
in
carrying
out
air
strikes
or
some
other
form
of
attack
in
response
to
the
use
of
the
weapons
but
it
remains
unclear
when
that
might
happen
or
even
if
it
definitely
will
we
have
proof
that
last
week
now
days
ago
that
chemical
weapons
were
used
at
least
with
chlorine
and
that
they
were
used
by
the
regime
of
president
bashar
macron
said
without
giving
details
on
the
evidence
or
how
it
was
acquired
the
attack
on
the
town
of
douma
on
april
killed
dozens
of
people
including
children
our
teams
have
been
working
on
this
all
week
and
we
will
need
to
take
decisions
in
due
course
when
we
judge
it
most
useful
and
effective
macron
told
broadcaster
when
asked
whether
a
red
line
had
been
crossed
president
donald
trump
tweeted
on
thursday
morning
never
said
when
an
attack
on
syria
would
take
place
could
be
very
soon
or
not
so
soon
at
all
macron
said
france
wanted
to
remove
the
syrian
regime
s
chemical
weapons
capabilities
when
asked
whether
those
would
be
the
targets
of
strikes
he
said
when
we
decide
it
and
once
we
have
verified
all
the
the
french
army
is
preparing
itself
for
a
possible
riposte
as
it
waits
for
the
political
green
light
military
sources
told
reuters
with
several
sources
underscoring
the
difficulty
of
outlining
the
objectives
of
such
an
operation
the
sources
said
if
france
were
to
attack
the
strikes
would
most
likely
come
from
warplanes
rather
than
its
naval
frigate
off
the
lebanese
coast
and
that
they
would
likely
to
take
off
from
france
rather
than
its
middle
east
bases
the
subject
of
chemical
weapons
use
in
syria
has
been
a
thorny
issue
for
macron
he
has
warned
that
he
would
not
accept
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
which
he
said
was
a
red
line
that
would
draw
french
action
even
unilateral
however
after
persistent
reports
of
chlorine
attacks
over
the
last
year
his
foreign
minister
and
aides
have
been
more
nuanced
saying
a
response
would
hinge
on
french
intelligence
proving
both
the
use
of
chemicals
and
fatalities
and
a
riposte
would
most
likely
be
in
coordination
with
the
united
states
france
will
not
allow
any
escalation
that
could
harm
the
stability
of
the
region
as
a
whole
but
we
can
t
let
regimes
that
think
they
can
do
everything
they
want
including
the
worst
things
that
violate
international
law
to
act
