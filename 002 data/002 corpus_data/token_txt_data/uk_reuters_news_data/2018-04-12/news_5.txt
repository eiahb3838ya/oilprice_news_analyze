it
does

further

ahead
said
walter
zimmerman
chief
technical
analyst
at
people
are
still
nervous
about
what
s
going
to
happen
in
syria
nothing
was
solved
oil
prices
jumped
on
wednesday
to
their
highest
level
since
late
after
saudi
arabia
said
it
intercepted
missiles
over
riyadh
and
president
donald
trump
warned
of
military
action
in
syria
both
of
which
raised
concerns
about
possible
supply
disruptions
some
fundamental
signals
also
supported
prices
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
said
the
global
oil
stocks
surplus
was
close
to
evaporating
due
to
healthy
demand
and
its
own
supply
cuts
the
group
is
producing
oil
below
its
targets
meaning
the
world
needs
to
use
stocks
to
meet
rising
demand
opec
said
in
its
monthly
report
oil
stocks
in
the
developed
world
fell
by
million
barrels
in
february
to
billion
barrels
around
million
barrels
above
the
latest
average
opec
mohammad
barkindo
told
reuters
in
new
delhi
the
global
oil
glut
had
effectively
shrunk
by
since
the
start
of
we
have
seen
an
accelerated
shrinkage
of
stocks
in
storage
from
unparalleled
highs
of
about
million
barrels
to
about
million
above
the
average
barkindo
said
opec
russia
and
several
other
producers
began
trimming
supply
in
january
their
pact
runs
until
the
end
of
the
year
and
opec
meets
in
june
to
decide
on
its
next
course
of
action
there
is
growing
confidence
that
the
declaration
of
cooperation
will
be
extended
beyond
barkindo
told
reuters
russia
will
continue
to
play
a
leading
these
bullish
factors
more
than
offset
pressure
from
a
government
report
showing
crude
oil
inventories
rose
by
million
barrels
while
production
hit
a
record
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
still
analysts
were
waiting
for
further
fundamental
signals
this
all
depends
on
whether
demand
will
be
as
strong
as
it
is
projected
to
be
