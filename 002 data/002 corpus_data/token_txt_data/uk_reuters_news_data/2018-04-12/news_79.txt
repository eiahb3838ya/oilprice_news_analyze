thailand
is
reaping
the

of
two

profiting
from

are
recovering
from
a

increasing
electricity
demand
due
to
economic

and
renewable

also
while
the

in

according
to
the

which
also
says
the

in
the
growth

beyond
include

already
see

grant
said
the
expansion
has
been
reflected
in
the

companies
growing
nearly
percent
since
the
start
of

a
broader

gain
of
less
than
half
that
it
s
also
sparked
a
rash
of

with

companies
having
raised
more

public

held
the
biggest

the

has
seen
in
a
decade
at
more
than

gulf
has
said
it
expects
revenue
to
grow
by
percent
this
year
fuelled
in
part
by
a
major
solar
investment
in
vietnam
the
ipo

will
be
used
to
repay
loans
and
finance
new
regional
power
plants
it
says
government
policy
created
an
ecosystem
for
growth
for
thai
energy
companies
said
maria
lapiz
head
of
institutional
research
at
maybank
kim
eng
securities
with
the
first
reforms
coming
in
the
that
s
when
the
government
began
allowing
small
power
generators
megawatts
to
sell
to
the
national
grid
thailand
was
also
an
earlier
adopter
of
natural
gas
which
now
generates
about
percent
of
its
electricity
in
thailand
was
one
of
asia
s
first
countries
to
introduce
tariffs
to
give
solar
developers
additional
payments
on
top
of
normal
prices
when
selling
electricity
to
utilities
channelling
investment
into
the
sector
similar
tariffs
have
been
applied
to
other
renewable
power
sources
including
wind
hydro
biomass
and
biogas
the
privatisation
of
ptt
was
another
big
boost
to
the
energy
sector
the
government
now
holds
a
percent
stake
in
ptt
which
operates
as
a
private
company
with
less
political
interference
than
state
rivals
like
malaysia
s
petronas
and
indonesia
s
pertamina
both
of
which
remain
under
full
government
control
ptt
was
privatised
in
which
helped
drive
growth
in
the
energy
sector
from
e
p
to
refiners
and
helped
in
the
development
of
the
thai
capital
market
said
lapiz
the
growth
trend
is
clearest
in
renewables
where
thailand
is
the
first
southeast
asia
nation
to
crack
the
top
solar
power
generators
according
to
the
international
renewable

agency
irena
thailand
started
development
in
renewable

much
earlier
than
regional

its

not

locally
but
also
in
vietnam
cambodia
laos
myanmar
bangladesh
and
australia
even
in

a

shunned

thai

growing
miner
banpu
in

reported
a
more
than
percent
surge
in
annual

partly
because
of

for
the
first
time
in

with
around

in
cash
on
hand
to
invest
at
home
and
overseas
not
all
indicators
point
to
an
ongoing
boom
local
consumption
is
stalling
due
to
low
population
growth
and
improvements
in
energy
efficiency
while
domestic
capacity
is
sufficient
to
meet
basic
requirements
going
forward
thai
power
company
growth
will
depend
on
the
ability
to
secure
capacity
and
have
a
steady
stream
of
projects
which
are
increasingly
coming
from
overseas
