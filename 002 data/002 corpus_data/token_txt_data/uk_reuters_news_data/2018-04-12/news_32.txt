european

began

futures
pointed
to
a
positive
open
after
president
trump
signalled
that
military
strikes
in
syria
may
not
be
imminent
and
a
strong

into

an
alleged

trump
on

amended
an
earlier
warning

on

writing
on

it
could
be
very

trump
had
declared
on

that

after
the
suspected

denied
any
responsibility

raised
the

between
the
two

powers
backing
opposing

heightened
geopolitical
tensions
have
piled
pressure
on
investors
already
rattled
by
a
trade
spat
between
the
united
states
and
china
and
a
generally
more
volatile
market
we
are
seeing
this

shift

of

chief

villamin
expects
the

gauge
of

p
volatility
to
stay
around
the
mark
roughly
twice
its
average
level
last
year
the
vix
was
last
trading
at
its
lowest
level
since
april
if
your
portfolio
today
looks
like
it
did
last
year
then
you
probably
haven
t
done
enough
to
adapt
your
exposure
he
said
crude

fell
back
after
three

it

investors
are
really
torn
on
bonds
right
now
because
they
know
the
economy
is
strong
and
inflation
is
coming
up
said
ubp

he

faster
pace

also
returned
to

markets
the

index
rose
percent
to
a
session
high
after
trump
s
latest
comments
though
it
was
still
near
a
low
the

the

is
down

so
far
this

also
hit
by
concern
about
inflation
and
the
central

s
reluctance
to
tighten
its
policy
worries
about
the
middle

have
overshadowed
budding
optimism
that
washington
and
beijing
will
work
out
a
compromise
to
avert
a
trade
war
following
a
speech
by
chinese
president
xi
jinping
on
tuesday
underneath

maybe
that
is
a
bit
of
a
buying
