canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
will
break
off
a
foreign
trip
to
hold
an
emergency
meeting
with
the
premiers
of
two
provinces
locked
in
a
worsening
dispute
over
an
oil
pipeline
officials
said
on
thursday
the
unexpected
development
is
a
sign
of
the
pressure
building
on
trudeau
to
solve
a
problem
that
could
turn
into
a
constitutional
crisis
the
federal
liberals
are
pitted
against
the
pacific
province
of
british
columbia
which
opposes
plans
by
kinder
morgan
canada
to
almost
triple
the
capacity
of
its
trans
mountain
pipeline
from
alberta
to
the
west
coast
ottawa
which
approved
the
project
in
insists
it
has
jurisdiction
the
british
columbia
government
disagrees
citing
the
risk
of
a
spill
kinder
morgan
canada
fed
up
with
the
delays
is
threatening
to
walk
away
unless
the
dispute
is
settled
by
may
trudeau
left
on
thursday
for
a
trip
starting
with
a
summit
in
peru
on
friday
and
saturday
he
has
invited
alberta
premier
rachel
notley
who
backs
the
pipeline
and
british
columbia
premier
john
horgan
to
come
to
ottawa
on
sunday
trudeau
will
resume
his
international
trip
after
the
meeting
both
premiers
said
they
would
attend
the
ottawa
session
but
made
clear
they
were
sticking
to
their
positions
this
likely
is
not
going
to
be
the
end
of
the
story
it
s
a
first
step
a
senior
government
official
told
reuters
saying
trudeau
would
outline
the
various
financial
regulatory
and
legal
options
for
handling
the
crisis
it
is
the
first
time
in
decades
that
different
levels
of
government
in
canada
have
argued
so
openly
over
resources
energy
industry
analysts
said
that
unless
the
dispute
is
settled
canada
would
become
a
much
less
attractive
place
for
foreign
investment
i
think
there
s
a
hope
we
break
the
deadlock
and
the
prime
minister
can
get
beyond
the
political
public
posturing
said
the
official
who
was
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
media
and
requested
anonymity
this
is
impacting
market
confidence
and
investor
notley
who
is
threatening
to
cut
oil
supplies
to
british
columbia
told
reporters
in
alberta
that
she
did
not
have
any
particular
expectations
for
sunday
s
meeting
as
far
as
negotiations
go
there
s
only
one
outcome
for
alberta
that
is
that
the
pipeline
gets
built
she
said
a
source
close
to
the
matter
said
on
wednesday
that
trudeau
would
put
pressure
on
british
columbia
to
drop
its
resistance
but
would
try
to
avoid
tougher
measures
that
might
alienate
voters
who
helped
his
liberals
win
power
i
don
t
feel
there
is
any
need
for
for
provocation
or
for
threats
horgan
told
reporters
ottawa
and
notley
s
government
have
indicated
they
might
be
prepared
to
invest
public
money
in
the
pipeline
expansion
to
keep
the
project
alive
shares
of
kinder
morgan
canada
held
their
gains
following
news
of
the
sunday
meeting
and
closed
up
percent
at
c
notley
said
on
monday
that
if
trudeau
did
not
step
in
the
reverberations
of
that
will
tear
at
the
fabric
of
canada
for
many
many
years
to
horgan
reaffirmed
his
stance
that
ottawa
should
refer
the
matter
to
the
supreme
court
for
clarification
cabinet
ministers
have
dismissed
the
idea
saying
it
was
already
clear
the
federal
government
had
jurisdiction
over
major
pipelines
before
he
left
for
peru
on
thursday
trudeau
released
a
video
filmed
on
the
british
columbia
coast
in
which
he
said
i
wouldn
t
approve
major
pipeline
projects
if
i
wasn
t
confident
they
could
be
done
