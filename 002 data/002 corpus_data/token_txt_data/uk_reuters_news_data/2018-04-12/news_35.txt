energy
company
eneco
valued
at
up
to

his
opposition

starace
said
enel
had
recently
been
offered
german
energy
group
innogy

had
turned
it
down
because
it
did
not
see
any
clear
growth
potential

germany
s
rwe
and
announced
plans
to
break
up
innogy
in
a
major
shakeup
that
flagged
a
new
process
of
consolidation
in
the
industry
there
is
a
growth
story
for
endesa
as
a
result
of
a
potential
breakup
of
companies
that
have
a
less
than
sustainable
status
in
the
iberian
peninsula
starace
said
asked
if
enel
might
sell
endesa
to
fund
acquisitions
the
ceo
said
there
was
no
need
since
the
company
had
financial
headroom
to
fund
any
deal

when
asked
if
the
issue
of
sanctions
in
russia
was
having
any
effect
on
the
sale
of
enel
s
reftinskaya
coal
power
plant
the
ceo
said
he
was
confident
the
deal
would
be
agreed
the
plant
produces
power
for
the
russian
market
which
means
it
is
not
subject
to
any
embargo
or
sanctions
