solutions
that
work
for
the
poorest
people
in
the

s
largest
democracy
too
many

ask

a
relatively
large
sum
upfront
for
example
for

that

ill
afford
said

he

billion
live
with

grid
according
to
the
international

agency
the
poorest
spend
a
much
higher
proportion

on
energy
because
they

t
afford

lighting
so
they
keep
using
kerosene
which
is
expensive
dangerous
and
bad
for
the
environment
said
hande
hande
has
been
on
a
mission
for
more

to
change
that
by

find
out
what
technologies
they
need
and
how
they
can
finance
them
a
approach
won
t
work
if

re
a
blacksmith
your
needs
are
different
from
a

what
exactly
do
you
need
in
your

to
run
your
business

everyone
has
the
chance
to
run
a
business
he

has
turned
the
business
into
an
umbrella

addressing
gaps
in
energy
access
through

selling
installing
and
servicing
products
in
homes
schools
and

centres
across
