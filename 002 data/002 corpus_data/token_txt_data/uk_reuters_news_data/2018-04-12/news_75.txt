april
reuters
the
trump
administration
is
considering
allowing
the
sale
of
a
higher
ethanol
fuel
blend
in
the
summer
a
source
familiar
with
the
issue
said
a
move
that
would
placate
corn
growers
worried
about
the
future
of
biofuels
policy
president
donald
trump
recently
met
with
the
heads
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
the
department
of
agriculture
to
discuss
ways
to
make
the
renewable
fuel
standard
less
expensive
to
the
oil
industry
without
undercutting
demand
for
ethanol
the
rfs
requires
refiners
to
add
increasing
volumes
of
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
fuel
supply
each
year
which
is
a
boon
to
farmers
but
a
headache
for
refining
companies
that
must
either
blend
the
fuels
themselves
or
purchase
credits
from
those
who
do
trump
has
tried
in
vain
over
the
past
several
months
to
broker
a
deal
between
big
oil
and
big
corn
over
the
issue
and
has
faced
mounting
pressure
from
lawmakers
in
the
midwest
who
are
concerned
that
he
will
weaken
domestic
demand
for
ethanol
at
a
time
farmers
are
already
facing
a
potential
trade
war
with
china
that
could
hurt
export
demand
for
corn
and
soybeans
sources
had
told
reuters
this
week
that
trump
was
temporarily
suspending
his
consideration
of
a
refining
proposal
to
cap
prices
for
blending
credits
an
idea
that
the
biofuels
industry
has
opposed
as
damaging
to
farmers
but
in
the
meantime
the
administration
is
considering
moving
forward
with
plans
to
allow
for
the
ethanol
industry
s
long
sought
waiver
to
sell
gasoline
containing
percent
ethanol
in
the
summer
instead
of
the
usual
percent
blend
the
source
familiar
with
the
issue
told
reuters
on
wednesday
the
higher
ethanol
blend
called
is
currently
banned
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
due
to
concerns
it
contributes
to
smog
on
hot
days
a
worry
that
biofuels
advocates
say
is
baseless
if
done
soon
the
waiver
could
be
in
effect
in
time
for
the
summer

bowman
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for

not
comment
on
the
waiver
but
said
that
during
trump

monday
he
instructed
his
cabinet
to
continue
to
explore
options
that
protect
american
farmers
and
america
s
refinery
biofuels
proponents
have
heaped
pressure
on
the
white
house
after
reports
that
the
epa
was
granting
dozens
of
small
refineries
exemptions
from
the
rfs
to
help
them
avoid
the
costs
of
compliance
something
the
ethanol
industry
says
will
weaken
demand
for
their
product
on
monday
trump
acknowledged
farmers
may
bear
the
brunt
of
the
economic
harm
if
china
retaliates
against
washington
s
threat
of
tariffs
noting
that
we
ll
make
it
up
to
them
many
farmers
are
battling
debt
after
years
of
excess
global

and
depressed
prices
we
need
some
good
news
