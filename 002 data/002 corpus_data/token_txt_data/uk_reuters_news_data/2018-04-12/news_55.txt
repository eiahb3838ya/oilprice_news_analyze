update 3-australian pm says foreign interference bill has soured ties with china
sydney
reuters
australian
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
acknowledged
on
thursday
that
legislation
aimed
at
preventing
foreign
interference
in
politics
had
soured
ties
with
china
putting
a
biennial
trade
fair
in
jeopardy
relations
between
australia
and
its
largest
trading
partner
have
been
strained
over
the
past
year
partly
over
australian
concern
about
rising
chinese
influence
which
led
to
the
introduction
of
legislation
banning
foreign
political
donations
the
australian
financial
review
citing
unidentified
sources
said
this
week
china
had
denied
visas
to
australian
government
officials
to
attend
a
major
trade
show
denting
close
economic
ties
between
the
two
countries
there
s
clearly
been
some
tension
in
the
relationship
following
the
introduction
of
our
legislation
about
foreign
interference
but
i
m
very
confident
that
any
misunderstandings
will
be
resolved
turnbull
told
radio
in
melbourne
i
wouldn
t
say
they
ve
been
declined
turnbull
said
of
the
visa
applications
without
elaborating
the
foreign
ministry
did
not
respond
to
emailed
requests
for
comment
in
beijing
chinese
foreign
ministry
spokesman
geng
shuang
said
reports
of
visa
denials
were
unfounded
the
situation
does
not
exist
he
told
a
regular
news
briefing
australian
trade
minister
steven
ciobo
told
reuters
discussions
about
rescheduling
the
event
were
under
way
however
two
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
planning
for
the
australia
week
trade
event
said
it
was
unlikely
the
gathering
already
pushed
back
from
may
to
july
would
go
ahead
at
this
late
stage
there
s
no
way
of
knowing
that
things
would
change
sufficiently
for
australia
week
to
go
ahead
one
of
the
sources
who
requested
anonymity
because
he
was
not
authorised
to
talk
to
the
media
told
reuters
it
s
just
not
going
to
happen
said
the
second
source
last
month
frances
adamson
australia
s
most
senior
civil
servant
at
the
department
of
foreign
affairs
and
trade
said
she
was
still
trying
to
arrange
an
annual
visit
to
china
some
five
months
after
beijing
said
it
was
unable
to
accommodate
her
due
to
scheduling
conflicts
late
last
year
turnbull
referred
to
disturbing
reports
about
chinese
influence
and
warned
of
foreign
powers
unprecedented
and
increasingly
sophisticated
attempts
to
influence
the
political
process
the
australian
legislation
which
is
expected
to
be
passed
soon
also
requires
the
registration
of
lobbyists
working
for
foreign
countries
china
has
previously
expressed
its
displeasure
at
foreign
governments
through
a
range
of
responses
last
year
south
korean
companies
were
effectively
blocked
from
operating
in
china
after
seoul
agreed
to
install
a
system
that
beijing
strongly
objected
to
in
nine
singaporean
armoured
vehicles
were
seized
in
hong
kong
on
their
way
home
from
military
exercises
in
taiwan
which
china
considers
a
wayward
province
the
latest
spat
has
weighed
on
relations
which
are
now
arguably
at
an
even
lower
point
than
when
rio
tinto
executive
stern
hu
was
on
trial
and
subsequently
jailed
in
shanghai
on
bribery
and
industrial
espionage
charges
and
when
then
prime
minister
kevin
rudd
gave
an
inflammatory
speech
in
beijing
about
human
rights
china
bought
a
billion
billion
worth
of
australian
goods
and
services
last
year
but
trade
ties
are
only
one
side
of
a
delicate
balancing
act
for
australia
whose
security
relationship
with
the
united
states
has
limited
how
close
it
gets
with
china
turnbull
s
comments
also
come
just
a
few
days
after
he
warned
china
against
developing
a
military
presence
on
the
tiny
pacific
island
of
vanuatu
after
reports
by
australia
s
fairfax
media
encouraged
by
the
united
states
australia
has
sharpened
its
criticism
of
china
s
activities
in
the
pacific
and
the
south
china
sea
australian
international
development
minister
concetta
in
january
accused
china
of
funding
roads
to
nowhere
and
useless
buildings
in
the
pacific
amid
fears
canberra
s
historical
dominance
in
the
region
was
eroding
