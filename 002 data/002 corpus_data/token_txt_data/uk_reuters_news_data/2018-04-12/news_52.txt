danish
pension
fund
pka
with
some
billion
under
asset
management
said
on
thursday
it
has
excluded
oil
and
gas
companies
from
its
investment
portfolio
over
failure
to
live
up
to
the
goals
of
the
paris
climate
agreement
pka
which
has
previously
excluded
coal
companies
and
is
an
active
investor
into
technology
such
as
offshore
wind
power
said
it
would
target
carbon
emissions
in
the
automotive
industry
next
the
move
comes
as
big
investors
are
scrutinizing
their
exposure
to
fossil
fuels
and
stepping
up
pressure
on
the
world
s
biggest
corporate
greenhouse
gas
emitters
to
combat
climate
change
the
excluded
oil
and
gas
companies
include
anadarko
chesapeake
energy
marathon
oil
apache
gazprom
inpex
lukoil
rosneft
and
sinopec
pka
said
chief
executive
peter
damgaard
jensen
said
pka
had
reviewed
oil
and
gas
companies
to
check
if
they
had
the
right
managerial
focus
on
the
paris
agreement
in
their
of
those
will
be
added
to
an
observation
list
with
the
aim
to
push
them
in
a
more
direction
while
companies
will
remain
in
pka
s
portfolio
pka
which
oversees
the
retirement
income
of
danish
workers
said
it
would
also
put
pressure
on
the
automotive
industry
which
it
said
accounts
for
about
percent
of
global
emissions
automakers
that
don
t
invest
in
the
development
of
electric
and
hybrid
cars
will
pose
a
financial
risk
as
electric
cars
will
be
more
attractive
to
consumers
in
line
with
technological
developments
said
jensen
at
pka
we
will
have
the
same
critical
approach
to
the
automotive
industry
as
we
have
to
coal
and
oil
he
said
the
international
energy
agency
estimates
that
million
cars
need
to
be
converted
to
electric
or
hybrid
by
to
meet
targets
under
the
paris
agreement
