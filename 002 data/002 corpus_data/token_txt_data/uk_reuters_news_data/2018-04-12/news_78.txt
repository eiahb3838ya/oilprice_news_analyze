beijing

field
building
a
ugs
is
almost
like
developing
a
new

costly
and
requiring
management
skills
to
ensure
safe
operations
china
built
its
first
ugs
in
the
dazhangtuo
site
near
beijing
and
has
since
added
storage
facilities
with
a
total

almost
all
the
current
sites
are
built
from
tapped
or
producing
gas
wells
the
easiest
and
most
solution
said
ding
guosheng
of
petrochina
s
ugs
institute
which
is
responsible
for
designing
and
planning
the
facilities
it
takes
nearly
two
years
of
well
testing
and
data
analysis
to
identify
wells
suitable
for
storages
and
another
three
to
five
years
to
design
and
build
you
need
to
make
sure
that
dried
wells
don
t
have
leaks
detect
where
and
how
much
water
oil
or
gas
still
wanders
under
there
said
ding
we
make
sure
the
rocks
are
strong
enough
to
sustain
larger
pressure
when
it

turned

are
soliciting
industry
feedback
to
create
a
business
model
to
boost
investment
from
outside
the
dominant
state
majors
including
exploring
the
feasibility
of
trading
gas
storage
at
a
new
exchange
in
chongqing
without
government
policy
support
and
pricing
no
company
would
want
to
invest
it
s
expensive
to
build
and
costly
to
operate
said
han
jingkuan
president
of
petrochina
s
planning
and
engineering
institute
china
regulates
gas
prices
by
setting
the
wholesale
rates
and
allows
fuel
producers
to
charge
percent
more
in
peak
winter
sales
beijing
has
for
decades
been
subsidizing
residential
users
in
the
absence
of
a
commercial
model
it
remains
a
job
for
the
national
oil
companies
said
luo
jing
vice
president
of

development
of
china
gas
holdings
but
investment
is
being
sought
ma

petrochina

top
official
for
ugs
business
said
in
march
the
state
firm
was
in
advanced
talks
with
chongqing
government
to
in
several
storages
in
the
southwest
with
gas
deposits
buried
at
wells
deeper
than
metres
and
many
located
in
the
densely
populated
and
mountainous
southwest
china
faces
technical
and
safety
challenges
in
the
united

the
world
s
top
gas
consumer
abundant
and
shallow
salt
domes
are
often
used
for
storage
in
its
relatively
short
ugs
history
petrochina
has
tapped
limited
foreign
expertise
having
only
hired
gas
company
enron
for
designing
the
first
facility
in
the
late
and
recently
france
s
storengy
for
technical
appraisals
but
as
china
considers
less
familiar
geological
features
such
as
aquifers
and
salt
caverns
operational
and
management
skills
may
come
in
handy
from
experienced
players
like
russian
gas
giant
gazprom
and
french
storage
expert
geostock
gazprom
which
operates
storage
sites
seven
times
the
size
of
china
s
entered
into
a
study
with
petrochina
in
january
to
build
a
facility
at
shengping
in
northeast
china
the

also
a

planned
to
service

of

the

due
to
send

from
