interview-edp bullish on u.s. renewable power despite trump's support for coal
washington
reuters
de
portugal
is
optimistic
about
renewable
power
investments
in
the
united
states
despite
president
donald
trump
s
push
to
support
coal
and
nuclear
power
plants
and
a
tariff
his
administration
slapped
on
imported
solar
panels
its
chief
executive
said
in
an
interview
renewables
represent
the
growth
engine
of
our
company
antónio
mexia
who
since
has
run
the
power
utility
edp
one
of
portugal
s
biggest
companies
said
in
an
interview
on
tuesday
wind
and
solar
power
projects
represented
percent
of
new
investments
last
year
at
edp
s
renewables
arm
edpr
and
are
expected
to
continue
at
that
rate
in
and
in
mexia
said
edpr
operates
renewable
projects
in
other
countries
in
europe
and
the
americas
this
month
edpr
and
four
other
companies
joined
with
a
northern
california
power
provider
to
develop
an
offshore
wind
farm
with
advanced
floating
turbines
expected
to
have
the
capacity
to
generate
between
to
megawatts
mw
the
group
is
talking
with
fishing
industry
and
department
of
defense
representatives
about
locations
for
the
wind
farm
mexia
said
floating
technology
needs
to
be
proven
commercially
but
tests
for
the
last
five
years
off
the
coast
of
portugal
have
shown
the
floating
turbines
which
use
technology
similar
to
floating
oil
rigs
have
survived
waves
up
to
feet
m
high
traditional
offshore
wind
power
surprised
everybody
and
i
am
sure
floating
offshore
will
do
the
same
mexia
said
the
advantage
of
floating
platforms
to
be
placed
about
miles
km
offshore
in
deep
water
is
their
increased
efficiency
which
he
expects
will
reach
between
and
percent
of
rated
peak
capacity
that
s
up
from
about
percent
efficiency
which
the
energy
information
administration
said
was
the
wind
power
industry
s
average
in
edpr
also
invests
in
solar
power
but
its
latest
project
is
carefully
planned
to
begin
operations
after
the
phase
out
of
a
tariff
on
imported
solar
panels
that
trump
signed
into
law
on
the
percent
tariff
on
the
panels
drops
to
percent
a
few
years
later
before
being
phased
out
entirely
edpr
has
secured
a
mw
power
purchase
agreement
on
the
solar
project
with
hoosier
energy
rural
electric
cooperative
in
indiana
with
the
start
of
operations
expected
in
mexia
who
was
in
washington
for
a
summit
of
leaders
of
the
global
electric
power
industry
said
he
is
confident
wind
power
will
thrive
in
the
united
states
because
there
are
nearly
plants
and
companies
that
make
parts
or
source
parts
for
turbines
ensuring
the
renewables
sector
has
broad
support
nationwide
coal
will
have
a
role
in
the
near
future
he
said
but
eventually
he
expects
it
is
an
industry
that
will
disappear
despite
efforts
by
the
trump
administration
to
slash
regulations
on
coal
and
to
use
subsidies
to
support
struggling
power
plants
that
burn
the
fossil
fuel
coal
was
an
important
resource
domestically
for
edp
last
year
edp
posted
a
profit
after
its
revenue
fell
percent
as
a
severe
drought
in
portugal
and
spain
sapped
its
reservoirs
for
hydropower
and
forced
it
to
resort
to
more
expensive
power
generation
including
coal
and
combined
cycle
plants
the
company
said
in
march
despite
the
trump
administration
s
policies
to
support
coal
and
nuclear
plants
mexia
sees
the
united
states
a
preferable
place
to
invest
in
renewables
than
many
countries
in
europe
and
mexia
is
hopeful
that
trump
s
policies
will
not
spark
a
trade
war
with
china
that
could
affect
edp
the
company
s
biggest
shareholder
is
china
three
gorges
a
chinese
power
company
which
owns
a
nearly
percent
stake
it
s
a
game
where
nobody
wins
