new
zealand
will
not
grant
any
new
permits
for
offshore
oil
and
gas
exploration
prime
minister
jacinda
ahern
said
on
thursday
taking
the
industry
by
surprise
with
a
decision
that
it
says
will
push
investment
overseas
the
government
said
the
move
would
not
affect
the
country
s
existing
exploration
permits
and
any
oil
and
gas
discoveries
from
firms
holding
those
licenses
could
still
lead
to
mining
permits
of
up
to
years
ardern
who
campaigned
heavily
on
preventing
climate
change
in
the
to
last
year
s
tight
election
said
the
decision
was
a
responsible
step
and
provided
certainty
for
businesses
and
communities
we
have
been
a
world
leader
on
critical
issues
to
humanity
by
being
nuclear
free
and
now
we
could
be
world
leading
in
becoming
carbon
neutral

interest
in
oil
exploration
in
new
zealand
has
waned
in
recent
years
due
to
lower
global
oil
prices
with
only
one
permit
issued
in
compared
with
in
however
business
and
regional
leaders
said
they
had
been
blindsided
by
the
move
and
feared
the
government
was
risking
jobs
in
the
nz
billion
billion

and

industry
national
opposition
energy
and
resources
spokesman
jonathan
young
said
the
decision
would
simply
shift
production
elsewhere
in
the
world
while
neil
holdom
mayor
of
the
main
city
in
the
taranaki
region
labeled
it
a
kick
in
the
one
of
the
country
s
main
energy
companies
new
zealand
oil
gas
said
it
had
not
been
warned
of
the
change
we
note
that
the
announcement
is
a
sudden
change
of
policy
which
has
not
been
consulted
on
and
appears
to
conflict
with
the
government
s
promises
it
said
in
a
statement
the
company
whose
shares
fell
to
low
said
the
move
would
have
no
immediate
material
impact
on
its
financial
position
but
it
would
invest
in
exploration
and
production
assets
in
other
jurisdictions
the
oil
and
gas
industry
accounts
for
only
about
percent
of
new
zealand
s
economy
but
the
furor
underscored
the
challenge
faced
by
labour
which
has
a
support
arrangement
with
the
green
party
in
winning
over
the
business
sector
business
sentiment
has
plummeted
to
lows
since
labour
took
office
ending
almost
a
decade
of
conservative
national
rule
despite
companies
reporting
robust
demand
for
their
services
while
permits
for
searching
for
onshore
oil
and
gas
reserves
will
continue
and
existing
offshore
permits
would
not
be
touched
ardern
said
the
decision
was
about
setting
our
expectations
