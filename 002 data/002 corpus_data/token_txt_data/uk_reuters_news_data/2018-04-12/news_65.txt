thailand
is
expected
to
increase
the
share
of
electricity
generated
by
coal
to
diversify
its
fuel
mix
for
power
generation
the
country
s
energy
minister
said
the
share
of
coal
in
our
power
generation
mix
is
very
low
at
slightly
less
than
percent
energy
minister
siri
jirapongphan
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
international
energy
forum
late
on
wednesday
we
need
to
diversify
the
sources
of
fuel
for
our
power
generation
having
a
reasonable
percentage
of
coal
to
be
used
for
power
generation
would
be
a
necessity
in
considering
the
security
of
fuel
supply
to
our
generation
thailand
relies
mainly
on
natural
gas
to
generate
power
but
domestic
demand
is
falling
behind
consumption
requiring
the
country
to
import
more
piped
gas
from
myanmar
and
more
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
a
plan
by
the
electricity
generating
authority
of
thailand
egat
to
build
power
plants
in
the
southern
thailand
tourist
destinations
of
krabi
and
songkhla
has
been
delayed
for
years
due
to
opposition
from
villagers
and
environmentalists
we
need
to
conduct
a
more
global
strategic
environmental
assessment
to
identify
a
more
suitable
location
to
build
a
power
plant
that
thailand
needs
siri
said
adding
that
a
decision
on
the
plants
locations
could
be
made
towards
the
end
of
this
year
in
terms
of
contribution
to
carbon
dioxide
generation
thailand
can
be
considered
as
one
of
the
lowest
in
the
world
siri
said
thailand
has
promoted
the
use
of
renewable
energy
aggressively
over
the
past
years
he
said
adding
that
the
share
of
electricity
generation
from
renewables
has
reached
around
percent
which
is
the
highest
rate
among
the
countries
that
make
up
the
association
of
southeast
asian
nations
but
that
achievement
came
at
an
expense
as
we
re
paying
a
high
rate
for
generation
of
electricity
from
renewable
resources
he
said
authorities
increased
retail
electricity
prices
by
percent
last
year
for
the
first
time
since
citing
rising
oil
and
gas
prices
falling
costs
for
solar
panels
has
made
the
renewable
resource
competitive
against
fossil
fuels
we
have
proven
in
several
pilot
projects
that
we
can
expand
on
our
success
to
promote
more
electricity
generation
from
renewable
resources
at
a
price
which
we
call
grid
parity
at
cents
per
kilowatt
hour
on
a
wholesale
going
forward
siri
said
thailand
will
only
be
accepting
prices
of
electricity
generated
from
renewable
sources
