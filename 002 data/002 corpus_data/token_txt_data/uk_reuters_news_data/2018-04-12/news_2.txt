update 4-in boost for farmers, trump says he may allow e15 gasoline sales all year
washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
said
on
thursday
his
administration
may
allow
the
sale
of
gasoline
containing
percent
ethanol
which
could
help
farmers
by
firing
up
corn
demand
but
faces
opposition
from
big
oil
the
proposal
marks
the
latest
move
by
the
trump
administration
to
navigate
the
rival
oil
and
corn
constituencies
as
they
clash
over
the
nation
s
biofuels
policy
oil
refiners
say
the
renewable
fuel
standard
requiring
them
to
add
biofuels
into
gasoline
is
costly
and
displaces
petroleum
while
the
farm
sector
says
the
law
provides
critical
support
to
growers
the
environmental
protection
agency
currently
bans
the
higher
ethanol
blend
called
during
summer
because
of
concerns
it
contributes
to
smog
on
hot
days
a
worry
biofuels
advocates
say
is
unfounded
gasoline
typically
contains
just
percent
ethanol
we
re
going
to
be
going
probably
probably
to
and
we
re
going
to
be
going
to
a
period
trump
told
reporters
during
a
white
house
meeting
we
re
going
to
work
out
something
during
the
transition
period
which
is
not
easy
very
earlier
on
thursday
epa
spokeswoman
liz
bowman
said
the
agency
has
been
assessing
the
legal
validity
of
granting
an
waiver
since
last
summer
and
is
awaiting
an
outcome
from
discussions
with
the
white
house
the
department
of
agriculture
and
congress
before
making
any
final
decisions
monte
shaw
executive
director
of
the
iowa
renewable
fuels
association
said
the
proposed
shift
to
sales
would
be
very
exciting
it
would
be
a
great
morale
boost
for
rural
america
and
more
importantly
a
real
demand
boost
if
it
can
be
moved
forward
quickly
he
said
in
an
interview
under
the
rfs
the
epa
sets
the
volume
of
ethanol
and
other
biofuels
that
must
be
mixed
into
the
nation
s
fuel
supply
on
a
yearly
basis
and
a
move
to
expand
sales
could
encourage
the
epa
to
set
those
volumes
higher
in
coming
years
currently
refiners
are
required
to
blend
around
billion
gallons
of
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
fuel
annually
shares
of
major
biofuels
producers
rose
slightly
after
the
announcement
archer
daniels
midland
co
shares
gained
percent
to
close
at
it
was
unclear
however
whether
the
move
would
help
the
refining
sector
which
has
been
lobbying
hard
instead
for
a
cap
on
the
price
of
blending
credits
that
refiners
must
acquire
to
prove
compliance
with
the
rfs
greater
blending
of
ethanol
through
sales
would
theoretically
increase
supplies
of
the
tradable
credits
and
thus
reduce
prices
but
at
the
same
time
more
ethanol
translates
to
a
smaller
share
of
fuel
in
american
gas
tanks
which
would
hurt
refiner
sales
the
american
petroleum
institute
which
represents
big
oil
companies
issued
a
statement
opposing
trump
s
proposal
to
expand
sales
arguing
that
fuel
can
damage
engines
and
is
incompatible
with
certain
boats
motorcycles
and
lawn
mowers
the
industry
plans
to
consider
all
options
to
prevent
such
a
waiver
the
rfs
is
broken
and
we
continue
to
believe
the
best
solution
is
comprehensive
legislation
