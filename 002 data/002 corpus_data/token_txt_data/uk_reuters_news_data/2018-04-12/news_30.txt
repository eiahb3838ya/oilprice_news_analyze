and

even
as
a
global
glut
of

is
set
to
evaporate

opec
mohammad
barkindo
said
on
thursday
in
an
interview
with
reuters
in
new
delhi
barkindo
said
the
initial
draft
of
a
alliance
agreement
between
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
producers
would
be
discussed
at
their
june
meeting
in
vienna
there
is
growing
confidence
that
the
declaration
of
cooperation
will
be
extended
beyond
barkindo
told
reuters
russia
will
continue
to
play
a
leading
opec
russia
and
several
other
producers
began
to
cut
supply
in
january
in
an
effort
to
lift
oil
prices
the
pact
runs
until
the
end
of
this
year
and
the
june
meeting
will
see
the
participants
decide
their
next
course
of
action
opec
s
de
facto
leader
saudi
arabia
has
said
it
would
like
the
pact
under
which
output
is
being
reduced
by
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
be
extended
into
the
opec
said
its
collective
output
according
to
secondary
sources
fell
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
in
march
from
february
driven
by
declines
in
angola
algeria
venezuela
saudi
arabia
and
libya
the
figure
is
below
the
million
bpd
that
opec
sees
as
demand
for
its
crude
for
the
whole
of
we
have
achieved
an
over
percent
conformity
level
he
said
referring
to
opec
s
commitments
under
the
pact
we
have
seen
an
accelerated
shrinkage
of
stocks
in
storage
from
unparalleled
highs
of
about
million
barrels
to
about
million
above
the
average
barkindo
said
lower
production
from
opec
has
helped
offset
booming
shale
oil
output
and
with
global
demand
rising
by
more
than
percent
this
year
consumers
are
having
to
drain
stocks
barkindo
said
he
expected
the
global
oil
market
to
rebalance
in
the
second
to
third
quarters
of
earlier
than
a
previous
forecast
of
the
opec
said
on
thursday
that
healthy
economic
growth
strong
car
sales
and
product
consumption
should
help
boost
the
global
market
for
oil
products
in
coming
months
