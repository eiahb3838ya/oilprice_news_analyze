turkey
has
temporarily
stopped

officials
said
on
thursday
turkey
s
ambassador
to
baghdad
and
iraq

the

agreed
that
when
ankara
resumes
filling
the
ilisu
dam
in
july
it
will
still
allow
sufficient
water
to
flow
into
iraq
the
dam
more
than
years
in
the
making
will
generate
electricity
for
a
large
area
of
southeast
turkey
but
it
has
been
heavily
criticised
over
its
impact
on
the
environment
and
on
the
tens
of
thousands
of
villagers
who
will
be
displaced
its
waters
will
also
submerge
a
town
turkey
started
filling
the
ilisu
dam
last
week
prompting
deep
concern
over
water
shortages
in
iraq
ankara
had
already
delayed
the
planned
start
by
three
months
at
the
request
of
its
southern
neighbour
turkey
s
ambassador
to
iraq
fatih
yildiz
said
on
twitter
that
turkey
stopped
filling
the
dam
on
president
tayyip
erdogan
s
orders
to
address
iraq
s
worries
as
of
this
moment
tigris
waters
are
being
transferred
to
iraq
without
touching
a
drop
of
it
in
ilisu
yildiz
said
with
the
second
decision
to
postpone
we
have
shown
once
again
that
we
can
put
our
neighbour
s
needs
ahead
of
our
the
filling
will
resume
on
july
he
said
adding
that
water
will
still
flow
into
iraq
in
accordance
with
agreements
between
the
two
countries
iraq
s
minister
of
water
resources
hassan
said
iraq
had
asked
for
the
postponement
and
that
the
two
countries
had
agreed
on
a
way
to
fill
it
while
still
allowing
adequate
water
supplies
to
iraq
we
asked
them
to
postpone
until
the
end
of
june
turkey
agreed
and
we
were
very
happy
he
told
a
news
conference
in
baghdad
the
way
the
dam
gets
filled
is
very
important
and
we
found
a
filling
method
that
guarantees
iraq
s
around
percent
of
iraq
s
water
resources
flow
from
neighbouring
countries
especially
in
the
tigris
and
the
euphrates
rivers
which
run
through
turkey
the
dam
which
first
got
turkish
government
approval
in
is
a
key
part
of
turkey
s
southeastern
anatolia
project
designed
to
improve
its
poorest
and
least
developed
region
but
western
export
credit
insurers
quit
the
project
saying
it
did
not
meet
international
standards
on
the
environment
and
preservation
of
cultural
heritage
the
government
later
secured
credit
from
three
local
banks
to
continue
construction
erdogan
said
in
an
election
rally
two
weeks
ago
that
the
billion
lira
billion
pounds
dam
which
he
described
as
a
truly
gigantic
project
would
start
generating
electricity
next
year
once
it
is
filled
ilisu
will
completely
or
partially
flood
villages
and
the
town
of
hasankeyf
which
is
home
to
people
according
a
report
from
a
campaign
group
the
initiative
to
keep
hasankeyf
alive
hasankeyf
was
used
by
the
romans
as
a
fortress
to
ward
off
persians
the
town
was
later
destroyed
by
mongols
and
rebuilt
in
the
century
by
seljuk
turks
some
of
the
ancient
structures
have
been
moved
to
a
nearby
area
