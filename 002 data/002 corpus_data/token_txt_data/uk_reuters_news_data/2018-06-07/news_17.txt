belgium
s
kbc
will
limit
transactions
to
only
humanitarian
trade
after
the
decision
to
reimpose
sanctions
on
tehran
the
financial
group
said
becoming
the
latest
company
to
scale
back
activities
president
donald
trump
pulled
out
of
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
known
as
the
jcpoa
on
may
and
said
he
would
reimpose
sanctions
within
days
prompting
several
european
companies
to
announce
they
would
end
business
with
tehran
before
the
deadline
since
then
banks
insurers
shipping
companies
and
european
oil
refiners
have
been
gradually
severing
ties
with
iran
complicating
the
efforts
of
european
and
other
countries
to
keep
the
nuclear
deal
alive
immediately
upon
the
exit
by
the
usa
of
the
jcpoa
kbc
group
decided
to
restrict
its
policy
on
iran
to
humanitarian
goods
as
defined
by
ofac
the
company
said
in
an
emailed
statement
to
reuters
referring
to
the
treasury
s
sanctions
enforcement
arm
this
policy
allows
also
such
humanitarian
transactions
for
kbc
s
own
customers
beyond
the
of
november
as
long
as
it
complies
with
ofac
kbc
said
pending
transactions
for
goods
other
than
humanitarian
trade
would
be
wound
down
within
the
allowed
period
kbc
never
financed
any
deal
with
iran
but
only
processed
the
settlement
of
transactions
of
its
customers
taking
into
account
all
applicable
eu
and
ofac
sanctions
and
several
other
specific
conditions
it
said
international
sanctions
were
lifted
in
as
part
of
an
agreement
to
limit
iran
s
nuclear
activity
the
easing
of
measures
included
the
removal
of
some
sanctions
by
the
united
states
such
as
on
iran
s
financial
sector
kbc
which
is
an
integrated
group
said
it
previously
decided
in
to
support
well
established
customers
in
home
markets
in
belgium
the
czech
republic
slovakia
and
hungary
in
their
genuine
trade
with
iran
such
support
restricted
to
dollar
trade
only
and
always
subject
to
an
screening
of
each
transaction
and
all
parties
last
week
swiss
lender
banque
de
commerce
et
de
placements
bcp
told
reuters
it
had
suspended
new
transactions
with
iran
and
was
winding
down
activities
which
finance
sources
said
was
a
blow
for
tehran
germany
s
lender
dz
bank
said
last
month
it
would
halt
financial
transactions
with
iran
in
july
sanctions
specialists
say
humanitarian
business
with
iran
which
includes
the
food
and
medicine
trade
was
never
barred
before
but
the
complexities
involved
made
such
activity
slow
paced
due
to
concerns
over
dealing
with
sanctioned
entities
together
with
a
ban
on
dollar
dealings
