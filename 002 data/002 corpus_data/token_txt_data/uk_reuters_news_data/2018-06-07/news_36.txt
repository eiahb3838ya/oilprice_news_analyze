president
donald
trump
s
tariff
on
imported
solar
panels
has
led
renewable
energy
companies
to
cancel
or
freeze
investments
of
more
than
billion
in
large
installation
projects
along
with
thousands
of
jobs
the
developers
told
reuters
that
s
more
than
double
the
about
billion
in
new
spending
plans
announced
by
firms
building
or
expanding
solar
panel
factories
to
take
advantage
of
the
tax
on
imports
the
tariff
s
bifurcated
impact
on
the
solar
industry
underscores
how
protectionist
trade
measures
almost
invariably
hurt
one
or
more
domestic
industries
for
every
one
they
shield
from
foreign
competition
trump
s
steel
and
aluminum
tariffs
for
instance
have
hurt
manufacturers
of
farm
equipment
made
with
steel
such
as
tractors
and
grain
bins
along
with
the
farmers
buying
them
at
higher
prices

did

respond
to
a
request
for
comment
trump
announced
the
tariff
in
january
over
protests
from
most
of
the
solar
industry
that
the
move
would
chill
one
of
america
s
sectors
solar
developers
completed
installations
costing
a
total
of
billion
last
year
according
to
the
solar
energy
industries
association
those
investments
were
driven
by
tax
incentives
and
the
falling
costs
of
imported
panels
mostly
from
china
which
together
made
solar
power
competitive
with
natural
gas
and
coal
the
solar
industry
employs
more
than
people
about
three
times
more
than
the
coal
industry
with
about
percent
of
those
people
in
installation
and
percent
in
manufacturing
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
solar
was
really
on
the
cusp
of
being
able
to
completely
take
off

recently
lowered
its
and

forecasts
in
the
united
states
by
percent
and
percent
respectively
citing

at

manufacturer
whose
bankruptcy
prompted
the
trump
administration
to
consider
a
tariff
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
companies
with
domestic
panel
factories
are
divided
on
the
policy
solar
giant
sunpower
corp
opposes
the
tariff
that
will
help
its
panel
factories
because
it
will
also
hurt
its
domestic
installation
and
development
business
along
with
its
overseas
manufacturing
operations
there
could
be
substantially
more
employment
without
a
tariff
said
chief
executive
tom
werner
the
percent
tariff
is
scheduled
to
last
four
years
decreasing
by
percent
per
year
during
that
time
solar
developers
say
the
levy
will
initially
raise
the
cost
of
major
installations
by
percent
leading
developer
cypress
creek
renewables
llc
said
it
had
been
forced
to
cancel
or
freeze
billion
in
projects
mostly
in
the
carolinas
texas
and
colorado
because
the
tariff
raised
costs
beyond
the
level
where
it
could
compete
spokesman
jeff
mckay
said
that
amounted
to
about
projects
at
various
stages
of
development
that
would
have
employed
three
thousand
or
more
workers
during
installation
he
said
the
projects
accounted
for
a
fifth
of
the
company
s
overall
pipeline
developer
southern
current
has
made
similar
decisions
on
about
billion
of
projects
mainly
in
south
carolina
said
bret
sowers
the
company
s
vice
president
of
development
and
strategy
either
you
make
the
decision
to
default
or
you
bite
the
bullet
and
you
make
less
money
sowers
said
neither
cypress
creek
nor
southern
current
would
disclose
exactly
which
projects
they
intend
to
cancel
they
said
those
details
could
help
their
competitors
and
make
it
harder
to
pursue
those
projects
if
they
become
financially
viable
later
both
are
among
a
group
of
solar
developers
that
have
asked
trade
officials
to
exclude
panels
used
in
their
projects
from
the
tariffs
the
office
of
the
trade
representative
said
it
is
still
evaluating
the
requests
other
companies
are
having
similar
problems
scott
canada
senior
vice
president
of
renewable
energy
at
solar
project
builder
mccarthy
building
companies
said
his
company
had
planned
to
employ
about
people
on
solar
projects
this
year
but
slashed
that
number
by
half
because
of
the
tariff
pine

meanwhile
will
complete
about
half
of
the
megawatts
of
solar
installations
it
had
planned
this
year
and
has
ditched
plans
to
hire
permanent
employees
hanes
said
the
company
also
withdrew
an
project
that
would
have
cost
up
to
million
from
consideration
in
a
bidding

held
by

power
it
pulled
the
proposal
late
last
year
when
it
learned
the
trump
administration
was
contemplating
the
tariff
it
was
just
not
feasible
hanes
said
for
some
developers
the
tariff
has
meant
abandoning
nascent
markets
in
the
american
heartland
that
last
year
posted
the
strongest
growth
in
installations
that
growth
was
concentrated
in
states
where
voters
supported
trump
in
the
presidential
election
south
bend
developer
inovateus
solar
llc
for
example
had
decided
three
years
ago
to
focus
on
emerging
midwest
solar
markets
such
as
indiana
and
michigan
but
the
tariff
sparked
a
shift
to
massachusetts
where
state
renewable
energy
incentives
make
it
more
profitable
chairman
kanczuzewski
said
other
developers
are
forging
ahead
keen
to
take
advantage
of
the
remaining
years
of
a
federal

solar

is
scheduled

that
broke

the
company

pushing

said
ceo

but
the
tariff
is
forcing
delays
in

allow
the

to
take

he
said
trump
s
tariff
has
boosted
the
domestic
manufacturing
sector
as
intended
which
over
time
could
significantly
raise
panel
production
and
reduce
prices
panel
manufacturers
first
solar
and
jinkosolar
for
example
have
announced
plans
to
spend
million
on
projects
to
increase
panel
construction
in
the
united
states

the
tariff
creating
about
new
jobs
in

it

creation
sunpower
corp
meanwhile
purchased
manufacturer
solarworld
s
oregon
factory
after
the
tariff
was
announced
saving
that
facility
s
jobs
the
company
said
it
plans
to
hire
more
people
at
the
plant
to
expand
operations
without
specifying
how
many
but
sunpower
has
also
said
it
must
cut
up
to
jobs
in
other
parts
of
its
organization
because
of
the
tariffs
jobs
in
panel
manufacturing
are
also
limited
due
to
increasing
automation
industry
experts
said
heliene
a
canadian
company
in
the
process
of
opening
a
facility
capable
of
producing
megawatts
worth
of
panels
per
year
said
it
will
employ
between

workers
in
minnesota
the
factories
are
highly
automated
