the

had
decided
to
phase
out
and
exit
all
activities
to

from
iran
and
suspend
existing
relations
with
iran
that
allowed
it
to
support
certain
customers
in
doing
business
there
during
recent
months
the
operational

reputational
risks
associated
with

sanctions
specialists
say
humanitarian
business
with
iran
which
includes
the
food
and
medicine
trade
was
never
barred
before
but
the
complexities
involved
made
such
activity
slow
paced
due
to
concerns
over
dealing
with
sanctioned
entities
together
with
a
ban
on
dollar
dealings
