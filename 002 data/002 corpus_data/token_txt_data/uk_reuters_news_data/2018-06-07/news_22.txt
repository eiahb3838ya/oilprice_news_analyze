algeria
s
president
abdelaziz
bouteflika
has
stopped
unpopular
tax
increases
and
reforms
to
assert
his
authority
and
counter
doubts
about
his
health
amid
mounting
speculation
that
he
will
seek
a
fifth
term
analysts
said
there
has
been
uncertainty
over
the
direction
of
algeria
an
opec
producer
and
key
gas
supplier
to
europe
as
bouteflika
in
office
since
has
rarely
appeared
in
public
since
suffering
a
stroke
in
the
opposition
and
some
intellectuals
have
urged
the
not
to
run
again
in
next
year
s
polls
due
to
health
concerns
imposing
his
authority
bouteflika
late
on
tuesday
vetoed
down
a
plan
by
prime
minister
ahmed
ouyahia
to
drastically
increase
duties
for
passport
and
other
documents
to
cope
with
a
halving
in
vital
gas
and
oil
revenues
between
and
he
had
already
stopped
another
proposal
to
open
up
farming
to
foreign
investors
to
diversify
the
economy
and
seek
new
revenues
with
oil
prices
having
recovered
bouteflika
stopped
the
plans
while
announcing
social
and
infrastructure
spending
worth
billion
dinars
billion
to
boost
his
credentials
ahead
of
a
possible
new
candidature
analysts
said
he
bouteflika
wants
to
show
that
he
is
the
country
s
ruler
said
a
local
analyst
asking
not
to
be
named
due
to
sensitivity
of
issue
his
move
came
just
a
week
after
a
group
of
intellectuals
and
opposition
figures
urged
bouteflika
not
to
seek
a
fifth
term
your
advanced
age
and
your
dramatic
state
of
health
command
you
to
not
take
care
of
the
duties
of
the
state
any
more
they
wrote
in
an
open
letter
there
is
no
doubt
that
another
mandate
would
be
an
ordeal
for
you
and
for
the
country
the
letter
said
talking
tough
in
a
country
where
open
dissent
has
been
rare
since
a
civil
war
with
islamists
in
the
killed
some
bouteflika
has
yet
to
say
whether
he
will
run
again
but
the
ruling
fln
party
has
urged
him
to
do
so
if
he
does
that
would
mean
stability
for
the
elites
of
fln
army
and
business
tycoons
to
postpone
a
potentially
controversial
succession
but
it
would
move
algeria
where
about
half
the
population
is
under
away
from
reforms
to
protect
it
against
future
energy
price
volatility
oil
and
gas
revenues
make
up
percent
of
foreign
exchange
revenues
ouyahia
had
launched
some
steps
which
proved
unpopular
in
a
country
where
many
harbour
suspicions
towards
foreigners
a
legacy
of
the
trauma
of
the
independence
war
with
france
for
the
elites
political
stability
for
now
is
key
analysts
said
while
another
term
for
bouteflika
could
be
a
source
of
dismay
for
young
algerians
worried
about
joblessness
and
austerity
it
would
give
a
ruling
caste
of
fln
officials
generals
and
businessmen
time
to
set
up
a
smooth
succession
ouyahia
dubbed
by
some
in
the
fln
as
a
dirty
mission
man
in
reference
to
some
unpopular
decisions
has
said
he
would
not
run
against
bouteflika
but
by
stopping
his
reforms
and
making
him
look
weak
bouteflika
has
sidelined
him
just
in
case
should
he
have
higher
ambitions
at
some
later
point
bouteflika
is
demonstrating
that
he
is
a
man
of
the
people
and
trying
to
portray
ouyahia
as
motivated
only
by
unsympathetic
fiscal
calculations
