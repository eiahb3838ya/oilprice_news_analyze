quotes
moscow
june

the
following
are
highlights
from
russian
president
vladimir
putin
s
annual
on
thursday
maybe
it
was
wrong
back
in
the
day
and
we
shouldn
t
have
created
new
billionaires
maybe
there
wasn
t
enough
to
justify
doing
so
but
what
s
done
is
done
whatever
we
could
return
at
the
last
minute
we
did
i
am
referring
for
example
to
the
creation
in
essence
of
a
controlling
stake
under
the
government
s
control
in
gazprom
and
the
creation
of
such
a
controlling
stake
in
leading
oil
company
nationalising
the
whole
oil
sector
would
be
a
difficult
and
highly
dangerous
process
which
could
have
negative
consequences
not
only
for
the
sector
but
for
the
whole
we
must
make
sure
that
no
matter
who
these
businesses
belong
to
they
work
within
the
boundaries
of
the
law
that
they
invest
in
resource
extraction
and
processing
on
the
territory
of
this
country
that
they
fulfil
their
duties
before
the
budget
in
full
and
make
their
businesses
effective
businesses
which
can
compete
on
global
markets
and
in
reality
our
oil
companies
are
achieving
there
are
weapons
being
developed
which
i
have
already
mentioned
two
pieces
of
hardware
with
engines
a
missile
and
an
unmanned
underwater
vessel
in
both
cases
we
have
completed
the
main
development
phase
in
particular
everything
to
do
with
testing
the
but
this
is
not
all
we
plan
to
produce
and
put
into
service
it
s
too
early
to
talk
about
it
but
we
will
do
so
firstly
the
use
of
our
armed
forces
in
the
battlefield
is
a
unique
experience
a
unique
tool
by
which
to
improve
our
armed
forces
no
amount
of
military
exercise
could
compare
with
the
use
of
force
in
combat
yes
we
know
that
the
use
of
force
in
battlefield
conditions
is
also
associated
with
loss
of
but
this
was
an
important
a
noble
mission
aimed
at
protecting
the
interests
of
the
russian
federation
and
its
let
me
remind
you
that
thousands
of
militants
left
russia
and
the
countries
of
central
asia
with
whom
we
do
not
have
hard
borders
and
gathered
on
syrian
soil
it
was
better
to
deal
with
them
there
to
get
to
work
there
so
to
speak
and
liquidate
them
there
than
let
them
come
back
here
weapons
in
major
military
operations
particularly
involving
russian
armed
forces
have
ended
there
isn
t
even
a
need
for
them
our
soldiers
are
there
in
syria
in
order
to
secure
russia
s
interests
in
this
critically
important
part
of
the
world
which
is
so
near
to
us
and
they
will
stay
there
for
as
long
as
it
is
in
russia
s
interest
for
them
to
do
as
yet
we
do
not
plan
to
withdraw
these
forces
but
i
direct
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
i
did
not
call
these
bases
by
any
other
name
i
called
them
bases
we
are
not
building
military
structures
there
and
if
we
need
to
we
could
withdraw
our
military
personnel
very
quickly
without
incurring
any
financial
russia
by
definition
can
not
have
its
own
crypto
currency
just
as
no
other
country
can
have
its
own
crypto
currency
because
when
we
talk
about
crypto
currencies
we
refer
to
something
that
goes
beyond
national
secondly
crypto
currency
mining
is
not
subject
to
regulations
here
and
we
by
and
large
treat
it
with
a
lot
of
caution
in
most
countries
crypto
currencies
are
not
used
as
a
means
of
the
russian
central
bank
believes
that
crypto
currencies
can
t
be
a
method
of
payment
or
exchange
or
be
used
for
savings
and
they
these
crypto
currencies
they
are
not
backed
by
however
this
phenomenon
has
its
place
in
the
world
and
it
s
developing
we
need
to
monitor
and
analyse
what
s
going
on
thoroughly
and
at
some
stage
we
will
need
to
look
at
how
we
can
take
part
in
this
process
how
we
can
use
it
to
avoid
all
sorts
of
restrictions
in
the
sphere
of
international
financial
activity
among
other
many
countries
are
turning
to
the
development
of
ecologically
friendly
forms
of
transport
including
electric
vehicles
as
an
answer
to
questions
about
ecological
conditions
this
has
some
specific
characteristics
here
in
order
to
produce
electrical
energy
to
charge
electric
vehicles
it
is
necessary
to
use
some
sort
of
other
source
of
we
have
to
shift
to
vehicles
and
stimulate
progress
in
this
direction
questions
arise
about
how
to
organise
petrol
stations
gazprom
is
working
on
overall
we
are
moving
in
the
right
direction
what
is
the
basis
for
saying
this
we
have
started
on
the
trajectory
towards
robust
economic
growth
in
russia
yes
this
growth
is
humble
small
but
it
is
also
not
a
fall
growth
was
at
percent
last
not
everyone
feels
this
personally
but
overall
this
is
an
objective
statistic
that
s
how
it
is
it
is
the
truth
export
in
technical
equipment
is
growing
which
shows
that
some
structural
changes
are
going
on
in
the
economy
export
of
agricultural
produce
at
billion
last
year
was
higher
than
defence
exports
which
were
at
based
on
our
preliminary
calculations
we
may
in
the
next
six
years
spend
trillion
roubles
putin
said
billion
but
meant
trillion
but
to
achieve
the
goals
that
we
have
discussed
we
will
need
an
additional
trillion
roubles
and
it
is
clear
where
we
are
going
to
find
firstly
it
is
through
the
growth
of
the
economy
itself
that
s
the
main
source
of
additional
resources
it
is
also
the
more
effective
use
of
existing
resources
adjustment
in
some
senses
of
our
plans
and
of
course
adjustments
to
our
tax
stability
of
tax
policy
must
be
absolutely
guaranteed
for
the
next
six
many
suggest
changing
the
personal
income
tax
we
thought
about
this
for
a
long
time
at
first
glance
progressive
personal
income
tax
seems
and
looks
to
be
but
reality
is
more
complicated
than
theories
and
we
had
such
a
tax
a
tax
on
revenue
this
is
a
serious
strain
on
the
economy
overall
and
in
the
end
on
citizens
because
it
inevitably
leads
to
a
rise
in
inflation
all
this
convinced
us
that
introducing
this
was
also
not
the
thing
is
the
development
plan
which
we
have
been
discussing
in
recent
years
it
was
being
prepared
by
the
previous
government
during
at
least
the
past
one
and
a
half
years
i
know
full
well
that
if
we
were
to
replace
the
entire
government
percent
and
bring
in
totally
new
we
would
have
lost
at
least
two
years
and
we
do
not
have
those
two
but
it
was
also
necessary
to
keep
those
who
made
the
decisions
for
our
country
s
progress
and
to
personalize
responsibility
for
what
has
been
done
so
far
and
for
what
is
coming
up
i
think
that
we
have
an
optimal
make
up
of
government
for
what
is
going
on
right
now
it
is
unacceptable
it
is
wrong
however
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
is
the
result
of
inaccurate
regulation
that
was
brought
in
recently
in
the
sphere
of
energy
in
energy
by
the
autumn
of
this
year
additional
measures
should
be
introduced
which
will
stabilize
the
situation
on
the
market
i
am
basing
this
on
the
fact
that
the
government
will
be
monitoring
this
agreements
have
been
reached
at
the
government
level
with
all
companies
to
increase
the
production
of
oil
products
and
on
deliveries
to
the
domestic
market
to
not
permit
a
additionally
we
have
worked
out
a
series
of
measures
aimed
at
stabilization
i
am
referring
to
the
possibility
of
introducing
export
tariffs
by
the
russian
government
on
deliveries
of
oil
products
for
export
a
law
has
been
prepared
on
this
and
we
will
be
ready
to
present
it
to
parliament
in
the
near
future
and
will
ask
parliament
to
support
we
are
introducing
the
possibility
for
government
to
raise
export
tariffs
on
motor
fuel
and
to
make
it
equal
to
tariffs
on
oil
exports
we
really
hope
we
will
now
have
to
put
it
to
putin
response
i
will
support
with
regards
to
the
infrastructure
these
stadiums
of
course
we
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
this
and
it
is
imperative
that
all
of
this
infrastructure
i
completely
agree
it
must
work
and
above
all
work
towards
the
development
of
sport
on
a
large
scale
including
children
s
i
would
like
right
now
to
address
my
colleagues
in
the
regions
to
ask
them
to
not
allow
under
any
circumstances
for
flea
markets
and
the
like
to
appear
at
these
stadiums
as
appeared
in
other
buildings
in
moscow
during
the
middle
of
the
i
think
our
russian
football
union
must
play
an
active
part
in
and
develop
a
new
generation
of
sportsmen
and
soccer
even
though
our
national
team
has
not
demonstrated
strong
results
recently
but
the
number
of
fans
of
this
beautiful
sport
here
is
massive
it
s
in
the
millions
we
will
rely
on
the
fact
that
our
soccer
team
will
score
a
big
win
so
to
speak
and
will
show
its
best
this
is
a
method
by
which
to
restrain
russia
the
notorious
sanctions
because
endless
accusations
lay
the
groundwork
for
introducing
restraining
it
is
because
russia
is
seen
as
a
threat
because
russia
is
seen
as
becoming
a
competitor
i
believe
this
approach
is
mistaken
instead
of
restraining
whoever
it
would
be
better
to
establish
constructive
cooperation
and
then
the
overall
effect
on
the
global
economy
would
be
it
is
clear
to
us
that
we
have
to
defend
our
interests
and
to
do
so
consistently
not
boorishly
or
rudely
in
both
the
sphere
of
the
economy
and
of
defence
we
have
done
so
and
we
will
continue
to
do
so
but
we
always
look
for
compromises
we
aspire
towards
those
compromises
the
pressure
will
end
when
our
partners
will
be
persuaded
that
the
methods
they
are
using
are
ineffective
counterproductive
and
harmful
to
the
understanding
that
a
third
world
war
could
be
the
end
of
civilisation
should
restrain
us
from
taking
extreme
steps
on
the
international
arena
that
are
highly
dangerous
for
modern
the
threat
of
mutual
destruction
has
always
restrained
participants
of
the
international
arena
prevented
leading
military
powers
from
making
hasty
moves
and
compelled
participants
to
respect
each
other
withdrawal
from
treaties
on
missiles
is
an
attempt
to
put
an
end
to
strategic
parity
but
we
will
respond
to
we
believe
that
the
unilateral
introduction
of
all
kinds
of
sanctions
does
not
resolve
problems
it
only
worsens
when
it
comes
to
the
position
of
our
compatriots
in
the
countries
of
the
baltic
we
are
constantly
talking
about
this
bringing
it
to
the
attention
of
the
governments
of
the
baltic
states
including
the
measures
that
we
take
to
protect
the
interests
of
our
compatriots
must
be
such
that
they
do
not
actually
worsen
their
this
is
an
important
part
of
the
negotiation
process
with
the
leaders
of
france
germany
also
with
our
austrian
friends
where
i
was
visiting
just
now
and
with
the
representatives
of
many
other
european
countries
let
alone
asia
they
don
t
just
say
this
privately
now
they
are
talking
about
this
it
appears
our
partners
thought
that
this
would
never
affect
them
this
counterproductive
politics
of
restrictions
and
sanctions
but
now
we
are
seeing
that
this
is
the
introduction
for
example
of
restrictive
tariffs
on
steel
on
aluminium
not
only
for
europe
but
also
for
canada
and
mexico
in
essence
these
are
also
they
are
related
to
the
pragmatic
national
interests
of
the
united
we
need
to
work
out
united
and
consistently
understandable
and
concrete
rules
on
how
to
behave
in
the
realm
of
security
and
in
the
realm
of
economic
when
in
i
spoke
in
munich
a
speech
that
is
frequently
quoted
i
spoke
about
the
fact
that
the
united
states
is
widening
the
jurisdiction
of
its
laws
beyond
its
national
borders
and
that
this
is
unacceptable
and
that
s
exactly
what
s
happening
now
also
to
our
european
and
other
partners
why
is
this
happening
no
one
wanted
to
listen
and
no
one
did
anything
to
stop
this
from
if
as
britain
insists
a
military
chemical
agent
was
used
against
these
people
they
would
have
died
within
second
or
minutes
on
the
spot
thank
god
this
did
not
happen
clearly
we
are
dealing
with
something
other
than
a
military
we
would
like
to
be
given
access
to
our
citizens
to
yulia
and
we
would
like
to
have
the
opportunity
to
take
part
fully
in
the
with
regards
to
big
business
i
spoke
about
this
a
few
years
ago
at
one
of
the
public
meetings
with
our
business
leaders
it
sounded
a
bit
rude
i
warned
them
that
this
situation
which
we
see
today
could
develop
i
warned
them
about
this
and
recommended
at
the
time
that
our
business
keeps
its
capital
in
russia
in
the
motherland
to
keep
capital
in
the
place
where
it
was
earned
and
to
use
it
to
develop
the
russian
who
is
going
to
help
them
abroad
they
are
just
persecuted
there
conditions
are
created
making
their
work
impossible
this
is
a
big
mistake
by
those
who
are
doing
this
in
the
west
all
these
restrictions
all
this
persecution
of
our
businesses
their
difficulties
with
dollar
transactions
it
damages
the
trust
businesses
from
our
country
and
others
have
in
the
economic
policies
of
leading
global
when
the
united
states
limits
dollar
transactions
this
damages
trust
in
the
in
essence
they
are
sawing
the
branch
on
which
they
are
sitting
this
is
counterproductive
and
damaging
for
those
involved
and
for
the
global
some
say
we
need
to
help
abramovich
and
other
russian
businessmen
who
have
ended
up
in
a
difficult
i
wouldn
t
want
to
speak
right
now
about
those
people
who
have
broken
various
laws
i
am
speaking
about
people
who
acquired
their
capital
through
legal
means
the
former
and
the
latter
are
better
off
being
in
i
hope
that
things
will
not
come
to
provocations
during
the
soccer
world
cup
if
this
happens
i
think
it
would
have
very
serious
consequences
for
the
ukrainian
government
in
we
are
not
going
to
close
anything
i
also
know
perfectly
well
about
the
situation
around
i
am
concerned
and
do
you
know
what
about
about
people
s
at
the
same
time
i
also
worked
in
the
security
services
and
know
it
is
easiest
to
ban
and
harder
to
find
civilised
solutions
therefore
i
m
going
to
urge
all
my
colleagues
to
take
this
route
the
route
of
security
and
law
enforcement
agencies
using
modern
methods
to
combat
offences
including
terrorism
without
restricting
freedoms
including
on
the
we
need
to
take
many
steps
forward
including
in
the
quality
of
our
satellites
in
the
quality
of
our
equipment
and
we
must
return
and
maintain
our
competence
in
launches
there
s
a
lot
of
competition
in
overall
and
in
general
we
have
big
and
very
ambitious
plans
for
the
development
of
our
space
program
i
assure
you
were
will
continue
down
this
path
it
is
no
accident
that
we
spent
a
lot
on
building
a
new
space
base
in
the
east
of
our
on
minister
current
deputy
pm
vitaly
mutko
his
english
obviously
needs
perfecting
but
his
work
as
sport
minister
and
then
deputy
prime
a
lot
has
been
done
in
this
area
it
is
enough
to
look
at
how
much
has
been
done
for
sports
and
physical
culture
we
should
look
at
the
facts
not
the
emotional
aspects
of
his
the
sochi
olympic
mutko
was
involved
in
this
the
world
cup
stadiums
this
was
largely
done
by
mutko
i
understand
everything
but
i
do
not
make
emotional
judgements
my
judgements
are
based
on
the
there
is
one
other
point
we
know
how
he
was
attacked
in
connection
with
the
doping
scandal
and
so
on
and
so
on
in
these
circumstances
it
s
just
impossible
to
send
him
into
retirement
i
repeat
he
has
a
lot
of
potential
let
him
recently
one
of
germany
s
famous
and
popular
publications
wrote
that
president
trump
is
pushing
europe
towards
putin
if
we
take
this
together
with
an
earlier
joke
that
russia
influenced
elections
in
the
united
states
then
this
all
taken
together
starts
sounding
pretty
funny
we
apparently
influenced
the
election
of
the
president
and
then
he
gifted
us
europe
total
nonsense
there
s
no
way
to
describe
this
other
than
as
a
