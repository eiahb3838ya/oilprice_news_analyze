the
interior
department
may
use
executive
powers
to
prevent
a
large
power
plant
from
shutting
down
next
year
in
arizona
the
latest
attempt
by
the
trump
administration
to
throw
a
lifeline
to
coal
and
nuclear
plants
the
head
of
interior
s
bureau
of
reclamation
said
on
friday
that
a
law
gives
interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
power
to
require
an
arizona
water
project
to
buy
energy
from
the
navajo
generating
station
or
ngs
a
power
plant
that
is
scheduled
to
close
in
such
a
move
could
delay
the
plant
s
closure
the
proposal
fits
neatly
with
a
broader
effort
by
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
to
keep
aging
coal
and
nuclear
plants
from
retirement
arguing
their
closure
would
constitute
a
threat
to
national
energy
security
hundreds
of
power
plants
have
shut
in
recent
years
along
with
several
nuclear
plants
under
pressure
from
cheaper
alternatives
like
natural
gas
and
advances
in
wind
and
solar
energy
assistant
secretary
for
water
and
science
timothy
petty
wrote
a
letter
dated
june
to
the
board
of
directors
of
the
central
arizona
project
or
cap
saying
the
colorado
river
basin
project
act
gives
the
secretary
governing
authority
to
decide
the
generation
source
for
the
project
with
the
act
in
mind
the
department
expects
to
consider
several
options
going
forward
including
the
feasibility
of
continued
use
of
power

letter
reviewed
by
reuters
said
a
spokesman
for
the
bureau
of
reclamation
dan
dubray
said
no
final
decisions
had
been
made
the
cap
board
is
due
to
meet
on
thursday
to
discuss
future
options
for
sourcing
cheaper
power
to
run
the
project
deette
person
spokeswoman
for
cap
said
the
board
was
focused
on
seeking
the
most
competitively
priced
power
and
that
it
s
not
our
understanding
that
we
are
obligated
in
that
way
to
buy
power
from
if
a
new
ngs
ownership
group
materializes
and
can
provide
competitively
priced
power
cap
remains
open
to
considering
that
alternative
she
said
in
an
email
the
ngs
and
a
coal
mine
that
supplies
it
are
both
on
native
american
reservation
land
and
employ
as
many
as
people
mostly
members
of
the
navajo
and
hopi
tribes
the
plant
was
uncompetitive
because
of
competition
from
cheaper
natural
facilities
and
will
shut
at
the
end
of
next
year
unless
it
finds
new
buyers
