australian
thermal
coal
prices
have
hit
their
highest
level
since
late
as
the
market
heats
up
on
strong
demand
across
north
asia
and
china
in
particular
spot
prices
for
delivery
from
australia
s
newcastle
terminal
last
closed
at
per
tonne
just
down
from
monday
s
the
highest
since
november
coal
last
reached
such
levels
back
in
early
newcastle
is
now
up
by
almost
percent
from
the
record
lows
seen
in
early
with
a
near
percent
increase
since
the
end
of
newcastle
coal
has
far
outperformed
its
main
fuel
competitor
liquefied
natural
gas
coal
is
even
close
to
the
percent
rally
in
brent
crude
oil
prices
which
has
come
on
the
back
of
voluntary
production
restraint
by
producer
cartel
opec
supply
disruptions
in
venezuela
and
looming
new
sanctions
against
major
exporter
iran
traders
said
the
price
rally
was
largely
down
to
a
surge
in
imports
from
china
as
an
early
summer
heatwave
drives
up
electricity
demand
for
air
conditioning
and
industrial
cooling
since
april
the
seaborne
thermal
coal
market
has
seen
quite
the
move
with
stronger
chinese
demand
being
a
key
driver
said
dutch
bank
ing
in
a
note
to
clients
adding
that
this
was
largely
down
to
warmer
than
usual
weather
data
in
thomson
reuters
eikon
showed
that
average
temperatures
in
china
s
capital
beijing
are
set
to
surge
to
degrees
celsius
in
the
coming
days
which
is
degrees
above
the
seasonal
norm
hot
weather
is
also
supporting
demand
in
other
key
demand
regions
in
north
asia
including
japan
and
south
korea
traders
said
however
commodities
brokerage
marex
spectron
said
in
a
note
to
clients
this
week
that
some
of
the
market
tightness
was
likely
and
could
soon
wane
as
the
peak
of
the
heat
wave
passes
ing
also
said
china
was
set
to
take
a
step
back
from
the
seaborne
market
in
order
to
support
domestic
miners
which
could
put
pressure
on
newcastle
coal
prices
