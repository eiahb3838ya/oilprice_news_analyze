uncertainties
in

said
xi
jianrui
senior
crude
analyst
with
oil
consultancy
jlc
said
venezuela
s
supply
trouble
comes
amid
voluntary
production
cuts
by
opec
which
have
been
in
place
since
in
order
to
tighten
the
market
and
prop
up
prices
the
group
is
due
to
meet
at
its
headquarters
in
vienna
together
with
top
producer
but
member
russia
on
june
to
discuss
production
policy
iraq
said
on
wednesday
that
a
production
increase
was
not
on
the
table
as
the
market
was
stable
and
prices
good
this
comment
followed
an
unofficial
request
from
the
united
states
asking
opec
s
leader
saudi
arabia
to
boost
output
outside
opec
however
there
were
ongoing
signs
of
rising
output
crude
oil
production
hit
another

that
s
a
percent
gain
in
two
years
or
an
average

growth
rate
per

since
surging

has
helped
widen
wti

to
more
