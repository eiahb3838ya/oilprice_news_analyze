sat
at

of
a
small
shallow
inlet
called
kapoho
bay
lava
pouring
into
the

there
has
completely
filled
in
the
bay
extending
nearly
a
mile
km
out
from

said
plumes
of
white
steam
and
hydrochloric
acid
fumes
a
vaporous
corrosive
mix
formed
from
lava
reacting
with
seawater
as
it
enters
the
ocean
could
be
seen
rising
from

distance
authorities
began
evacuating
the
kapoho
area
last
week
with
most
residents
ushered
to
safety
by
early
on
saturday
hours
before
lava
severed
all
road
access
to
the
region
i
just
locked
my
doors
and
walked
away

a
vacationland
resident
who
headed
the
neighbourhood
watch
group
there
it
s
an
emotional
roller
the
river
of
lava
then
spread
out
into
a
towering
blob
about
a
metres
wide
as
it
crept
through
the
flat
open
expanse
of
the
subdivisions
swallowing
everything
in
its
path
over
the
next
few
days
a
handful
of
residents
who
initially
stayed
behind
rather
than
heed
evacuation
orders
were
airlifted
by
helicopter
on
sunday
most
of
the
two
dozen
volcanic
vents
have
grown
largely
quiet
over
the
past
week
with
just
one
fissure
still
spewing
large
volumes
of
molten
rock
from
the
ground
as
of
wednesday
the
usgs
said
that
fissure
is
the
origin
of
the
lava
flow
that
devastated
kapoho
lava
had
covered
nearly
square
miles
sq
km
of
landscape
as
of
monday
and
some
earthquakes
had
been
recorded
on
the
big
island
since
kilauea
rumbled
back
to
life
last
month
that
s
nearly
times
the
monthly
historic
average
for
seismic
activity
on

island
