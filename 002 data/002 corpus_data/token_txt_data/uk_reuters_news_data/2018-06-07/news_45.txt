coal
prices
in
asia
are
being
driven
to
highs
by
a
rare
combination
of
simultaneous
demand
growth
in
the
region
s
top
four
importers
depending
on
the
price
used
thermal
coal
is
either
close
to
a
high
or
near
the
strongest
in
six
years
as
china
india
japan
and
south
korea
imported
more
of
the
polluting
fuel
in
the
first
five
months
of
this
year
compared
to
the
same
period
in
the
australian
thermal
coal
benchmark
the
weekly
newcastle
index
ended
last
week
at
a
tonne
not
far
from
the
hit
in
late
february
which
was
the
highest
price
since
march
the
daily
spot
price
for
newcastle

in

in

was

thermal
coal
from

has
also
been
performing
strongly
with
kilocalorie

coal
assessed
by

ending
last

at

up

low

it
s
still
below
the
peak
this
year
of

from
late
february
which
was
the
highest
price
since
october
no
matter
which
way
the
numbers
are
sliced
and
diced
the
message
is
the
same
namely
that
coal
prices
are
performing
strongly
despite
the
fuel
becoming
increasingly
unpopular
in
many
countries
because
of
its
contribution
to
air
pollution
and
climate
change
it
s
also
unusual
for
the
top
four
asian
importers
to
be
demanding
more
seaborne
coal
at
the
same
time
as
is
currently
the
case
china
imported
million
tonnes
of
coal
from
the
seaborne
market
in
the
first
five
months
of
the
year
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
supply
chain
and
commodity
forecasts
this
was
up
percent
or
million
tonnes
from
the
same
period
in
according
to
the
data
india
the
coal
importer
after
china
brought
in
million
tonnes
in
the
period
up
percent
or
million
tonnes
from
the
first
five
months
of
last
year
japan
imported
million
tonnes
up
million
tonnes
while
the
region
s
number
four
importer
south
korea
brought
in
million
a
small
gain
of
tonnes
put
together
these
four
countries
imported
million
tonnes
more
coal
from
the
seaborne
market
in
the
first
five
months
of
the
year
this
has
had
the
effect
of
tightening
the
market
given
the
lack
of
new
supplies
to
meet
the
demand
in
fact
exports
from
the
top
three
shippers
to
asia
have
been
remarkably
flat
in
the
period
according
to
the
data
australia
shipped
million
tonnes
in
the
first
five
months
up
slightly
from
the
million
in
the
same
period
in
indonesia
managed
million
tonnes
up
from
million
while
south
africa
was
steady
at
million
this
means
that
the
increase
in
import
demand
isn
t
really
being
met
by
the
traditional
export
powerhouses
allowing
countries
such
as
the
united
states
and
russia
to
plug
the
gap
the
united
states
shipped
million
tonnes
of
coal
in
the
first
five
months
of
with
million
tonnes
heading
to
asia
this
is
up
percent
from
the
million
tonnes
it
shipped
in
the
same
period
in
of
which
million
went
to
asia
it
s
a
similar
story
for
russia
with
total
shipments
up
percent
or
million
tonnes
to
million
tonnes
of
which
million
tonnes
went
to
asia
a
gain
of
percent
what
the
numbers
show
is
that
even
though
prices
are
high
and
rising
the
traditional
major
exporters
are
struggling
to
boost
shipments
in
australia
this
is
most
likely
because
of
an
inability
to
boost
production
quickly
enough
in
indonesia
it
s
largely
because
the
government
is
mandating
that
more
coal
be
supplied
to
the
domestic
market
and
in
south
africa
there
are
infrastructure
constraints
mainly
on
the
rail
system
the
numbers
also
show
that
currently
the
price
of
coal
is
high
enough
to
make
cargoes
competitive
in
asia
despite
the
greater
cost
of
freight
the
bulk
of
coal
exported
to
asia
is
coking
coal
used
to
make
steel
but
with
the
thermal
price
above
a
tonne
it
s
likely
that
more
of
the
fuel
will
head
east
especially
to
buyers
in
south
asia
