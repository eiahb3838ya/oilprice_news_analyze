moscow

the
following
are
highlights
from
russian
president
vladimir
putin
s
annual
on
thursday
the
introduction
for
example
of
restrictive
tariffs
on
steel
on
aluminium
not
only
for
europe
but
also
for
canada
and
mexico
in
essence
these
are
also
they
are
related
to
the
pragmatic
national
interests
of
the
united
when
in
i
spoke
in
munich
i
spoke
about
the
fact
that
the
united
states
is
widening
the
jurisdiction
of
its
laws
beyond
its
national
borders
and
that
this
is
unacceptable
and
that
s
exactly
what
s
happening
now
also
to
our
european
and
other
partners
why
is
this
happening
no
one
wanted
to
listen
and
no
one
did
anything
to
stop
this
from
it
appears
our
partners
thought
that
this
would
never
affect
them
this
counterproductive
politics
of
restrictions
and
sanctions
but
now
we
are
seeing
that
this
is
the
understanding
that
a
third
world
war
could
be
the
end
of
civilisation
should
restrain
us
from
taking
extreme
steps
on
the
international
arena
that
are
highly
dangerous
for
modern
the
threat
of
mutual
destruction
has
always
restrained
participants
of
the
international
arena
prevented
leading
military
powers
from
making
hasty
moves
and
compelled
participants
to
respect
each
other
withdrawal
from
treaties
on
missiles
is
an
attempt
to
put
an
end
to
strategic
parity
but
we
will
respond
to
on
possibility
of
military
in
eastern
ukraine
i
hope
that
things
will
not
come
to
provocations
during
the
soccer
world
cup
if
this
happens
i
think
it
would
have
very
serious
consequences
for
the
ukrainian
government
in
on
pressure
on
russian
businessmen
in
britain
and
elsewhere
with
regards
to
big
business
i
spoke
about
this
a
few
years
ago
at
one
of
the
public
meetings
with
our
business
leaders
i
warned
them
that
this
situation
which
we
see
today
could
develop
i
warned
them
about
this
and
recommended
at
the
time
that
our
business
keeps
its
capital
in
who
is
going
to
help
them
abroad
they
are
just
persecuted
there
conditions
are
created
making
their
work
impossible
this
is
a
big
mistake
by
those
who
are
doing
this
in
the
in
essence
they
are
sawing
the
branch
on
which
they
are
sitting
this
is
counterproductive
and
damaging
for
those
involved
and
for
the
global
some
say
we
need
to
help
billionaire
roman
abramovich
and
other
russian
businessmen
who
have
ended
up
in
a
difficult
i
wouldn
t
want
to
speak
right
now
about
those
people
who
have
broken
various
laws
i
am
speaking
about
people
who
acquired
their
capital
through
legal
means
the
former
and
the
latter
are
better
off
being
in
firstly
the
use
of
our
armed
forces
in
the
battlefield
is
a
unique
experience
a
unique
tool
by
which
to
improve
our
armed
forces
no
amount
of
military
exercise
could
compare
with
the
use
of
force
in
combat
major
military
operations
particularly
involving
russian
armed
forces
have
ended
there
isn
t
even
a
need
for
them
our
soldiers
are
there
in
syria
in
order
to
secure
russia
s
interests
in
this
critically
important
part
of
the
world
which
is
so
near
to
us
and
they
will
stay
there
for
as
long
as
it
is
in
russia
s
interest
for
them
to
do
as
yet
we
do
not
plan
to
withdraw
these
forces
but
i
direct
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
i
did
not
call
these
bases
by
any
other
name
i
called
them
bases
we
are
not
building
military
structures
there
and
if
we
need
to
we
could
withdraw
our
military
personnel
very
quickly
without
incurring
any
financial
obviously
i
m
always
thinking
about
it
a
successor
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
no
the
russian
people
the
voters
will
decide
who
that
will
be
but
of
course
i
think
that
we
should
raise
a
new
young
generation
of
leaders
responsible
people
who
will
be
able
to
take
on
the
responsibility
of
with
regards
to
the
infrastructure
these
stadiums
of
course
we
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
this
and
it
is
imperative
that
all
of
this
infrastructure
i
completely
agree
it
must
work
and
above
all
work
towards
the
development
of
sport
on
a
large
i
would
like
right
now
to
address
my
colleagues
in
the
regions
to
ask
them
to
not
allow
under
any
circumstances
for
flea
markets
and
the
like
to
appear
at
these
stadiums
as
appeared
in
other
buildings
in
moscow
during
the
middle
of
the
i
think
our
russian
football
union
must
play
an
active
part
in
and
develop
a
new
generation
of
sportsmen
and
soccer
overall
we
are
moving
in
the
right
direction
we
have
started
on
the
trajectory
towards
robust
economic
growth
in
russia
yes
this
growth
is
humble
small
but
it
is
also
not
a
fall
growth
was
at
percent
last
export
in
technical
equipment
is
growing
which
shows
that
some
structural
changes
are
going
on
in
the
economy
export
of
agricultural
produce
at
billion
last
year
was
higher
than
defence
exports
which
were
at
based
on
our
preliminary
calculations
we
may
in
the
next
six
years
spend
trillion
roubles
putin
said
billion
but
meant
trillion
but
to
achieve
the
goals
that
we
have
discussed
we
will
need
an
additional
trillion
roubles
and
it
is
clear
where
we
are
going
to
find
firstly
it
is
through
the
growth
of
the
economy
itself
that
s
the
main
source
of
additional
resources
it
is
also
the
more
effective
use
of
existing
resources
adjustment
in
some
senses
of
our
plans
and
of
course
adjustments
to
our
tax
stability
of
tax
policy
must
be
absolutely
guaranteed
for
the
next
six
what
is
going
on
right
now
it
is
unacceptable
it
is
wrong
however
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
is
the
result
of
inaccurate
regulation
that
was
brought
in
recently
in
the
sphere
of
energy
in
energy
by
the
autumn
of
this
year
additional
measures
should
be
introduced
which
will
stabilise
the
situation
on
the
putin
said
he
would
support
a
proposal
to
raise
export
tariffs
on
motor
fuel
equalising
them
with
tariffs
on
oil
exports
this
is
a
method
by
which
to
restrain
russia
the
notorious
sanctions
because
endless
accusations
lay
the
groundwork
for
introducing
restraining
it
is
because
russia
is
seen
as
a
threat
because
russia
is
seen
as
becoming
a
competitor
i
believe
this
approach
is
it
is
clear
to
us
that
we
have
to
defend
our
interests
and
to
do
so
consistently
not
boorishly
or
rudely
in
both
the
sphere
of
the
economy
and
of
on
restricting
russian
internet
access
we
are
not
going
to
close
anything
i
also
worked
in
the
security
services
and
know
it
is
easiest
to
ban
and
harder
to
find
civilised
solutions
therefore
i
m
going
to
urge
all
my
colleagues
to
take
this
route
the
route
of
security
and
law
enforcement
agencies
using
modern
methods
to
combat
offences
including
terrorism
without
restricting
freedoms
including
on
the
recently
one
of
germany
s
famous
and
popular
publications
wrote
that
president
trump
is
pushing
europe
towards
putin
if
we
take
this
together
with
an
earlier
joke
that
russia
influenced
elections
in
the
united
states
then
this
all
taken
together
starts
sounding
pretty
funny
we
apparently
influenced
the
election
of
the
president
and
then
he
gifted
us
europe
total
nonsense
there
s
no
way
to
describe
this
other
than
as
a
nationalising
the
whole
oil
sector
would
be
a
difficult
and
highly
dangerous
process
which
could
have
negative
consequences
not
only
for
the
sector
but
for
the
whole
this
phenomenon
has
its
place
in
the
world
and
it
s
developing
we
need
to
monitor
and
analyse
what
s
going
on
thoroughly
and
at
some
stage
we
will
need
to
look
at
how
we
can
take
part
in
this
process
how
we
can
use
it
to
avoid
all
sorts
of
restrictions
in
the
sphere
of
international
financial
activity
