scientists say cost of sucking carbon from thin air could tumble

high
costs
of
extracting
greenhouse
gases
from
thin
air
could
tumble
with
new
technologies
that
can
help
to
combat
climate
change
scientists
said
on
thursday
carbon
engineering
a
clean
energy
company
outlined
the
design
of
a
large
industrial
plant
that
it
said
could
capture
carbon
dioxide
from
the
atmosphere
at
a
cost
of
between
and
a
tonne
that
is
well
below
past
estimates
of
about
a
tonne
by
the
american
physical
society
said
david
keith
a
harvard
university
physics
professor
and
the
founder
of
carbon
engineering
who
led
the
research
i
hope
to
show
that
this
as
a
viable
energy
industrial
technology
not
something
that
is
a
magic
bullet
but
something
that
is
completely
doable
he
told
reuters
of
the
study
published
in
the
journal
joule
carbon
engineering
which
has
about
employees
and
produces
about
a
tonne
of
carbon
dioxide
a
day
from
an
experimental
plant
the
technology
makes
synthetic
fuels
using
only
air
water
and
renewable
power
keith
said
an
plant
could
make
fuel
at
a
dollar
a
litre
that
would
be
competitive
in
california
where
low
carbon
fuel
standards
to
cut
pollution
from
cars
and
trucks
mean
high
prices
he
said
some
investors
were
interested
an
industrial
plant
costing
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
could
capture
a
million
tonnes
of
carbon
dioxide
a
year
equivalent
to
emissions
by
cars
other
experts
welcomed
the
study
as
a
step
to
clear
up
huge
uncertainties
about
the
costs
of
direct
air
capture
reports
indicate
that
governments
may
have
to
deploy
such
novel
technologies
this
century
to
remove
carbon
from
nature
and
bury
it
to
limit
global
warming
under
the
paris
climate
agreement
direct
air
capture
is
a
politically
promising
route
for
carbon
dioxide
removal
said
oliver
geden
of
the
german
institute
for
international
and
security
affairs
and
an
air
capture
plant
could
be
built
almost
anywhere
it
would
not
threaten
farmland
unlike
options
of
planting
vast
forests
which
soak
up
carbon
dioxide
he
said
climeworks
a
swiss
company
and
carbon
engineering
s
main
rival
also
told
reuters
it
was
hoping
to
cut
its
production
price
to
a
tonne
in
the
next
years
from
about
now
it
sells
carbon
dioxide
to
greenhouses
as
an
airborne
fertiliser
to
grow
tomatoes
or
cucumbers
jan
wurzbacher
a
founder
of
climeworks
said
more
and
more
governments
are
likely
to
jack
up
penalties
on
carbon
emissions
to
limit
floods
storms
and
rising
seas
in
coming
years
making
the
technology
more
viable

sweden
has
the

taxes
currently
swedish
