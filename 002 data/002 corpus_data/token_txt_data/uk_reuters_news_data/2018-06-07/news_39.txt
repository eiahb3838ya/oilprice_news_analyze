production
at
the
groningen
natural
gas
field
could
be
reduced
to
less
than
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
per
year
by
october
faster
than
planned
the
dutch
economic
affairs
minister
said
in
a
letter
to
parliament
on
thursday
output
was
projected
to
drop
to
below
bcm
from
its
current
cap
of
bcm
per
year
within
four
to
five
years
under
plans
announced
by
prime
minister
mark
rutte
in
march
aimed
at
ending
production
at
groningen
by
due
to
the
damaging
earthquakes
it
causes
but
that
goal
is
likely
to
be
reached
earlier
minister
eric
wiebes
wrote
as
measures
to
reduce
demand
for
groningen
gas
have
made
promising
progress
in
recent
months
extra
capacity
to
convert
imported
gas
to
the
gas
needed
for
the
dutch
network
and
switching
large
industrial
users
off
groningen
gas
could
cut
production
to
less
than
bcm
by
wiebes
said
reductions
in
german
demand
and
purchases
of
nitrogen
to
mix
with
imported
gas
could
even
see
that
target
reached
a
year
earlier
these
measures
combined
could
allow
for
a
fall
in
groningen
production
to
less
than
bcm
by
in
an
average
year
or
bcm
in
a
cold
year
wiebes
said
he
will
present
a
draft
plan
for
setting
groningen
s
production
cap
for
the
year
beginning
in
october
by
the
end
of
august
he
said
that
plan
will
be
based
largely
on
the
projections
made
in
march
the
minister
wrote
as
the
extra
reductions
identified
are
mostly
expected
in
the
year
starting
october
