finland slashes russia power trading tariffs to ease imports

finland
will
reduce
the
tariff
it
charges
on
electricity
imports
from
russia
making
it
cheaper
for
energy
traders
to
sell
more
russian
power
and
boost
the
nordic
country
s
security
of
supply
its
grid
chief
told
reuters
the
move
conflicts
with
european
union
efforts
to
encourage
eu
members
to
reduce
dependency
on
russian
energy
supplies
imports
from
russia
as
well
as
sweden
are
indispensable
for
finland
to
meet
its
growing
domestic
electricity
needs
and
to
cover
its
power
production
deficit
but
tariffs
transmission
fees
and
capacity
payments
kept
russian
flows
low
last
winter
fingrid
the
country
s
grid
will
cut
russian
tariff
levels
from
july
onwards
the
coefficient
a
tariff
adjustment
rate
will
be
slashed
to
for
importing
power
in
hours
and
scrapped
altogether
for
peak
hours
reducing
the
trading
tariffs
will
in
principle
make
it
less
costly
for
traders
to
import
russian
power
it
is
good
for
finland
s
security
of
supply
fingrid
s
chief
executive
jukka
ruusunen
said
in
the
power
trade
finland
s
imports
far
exceed
its
exports
but
high
transmission
fees
and
capacity
payments
for
electricity
at
times
make
it
unprofitable
to
send
even
at
seasonal
peak
prices
high
transmission
fees
that
vary
depending
on
finland
s
and
russia
s
price
differences
remain
a
discouraging
factor
for
traders
and
were
the
main
cause
for
last
winter
s
low
imports
but
cutting
the
coefficient
to
zero
could
push
them
up
the
transmission
fees
are
dynamic
in
peak
demand
even
when
prices
are
really
high
they
also
grow
that
is
why
we
had
so
low
russian
imports
last
winter
but
lower
tariffs
will
make
imports
just
a
bit
less
costly
ruusunen
said
reliability
of
power
supply
is
particularly
crucial
to
finland
as
its
industrial
sector
including
pulp
and
paper
makers
such
as
upm
and
stora
enso
but
also
for
data
centres
that
it
wants
built
finland
which
imports
up
to
a
fifth
of
its
electricity
needs
at
times
of
peak
winter
demand
saw
industrial
energy
needs
grow
by
percent
last
year
while
net
power
imports
hit
a
record
high
net
imports
of
electricity
to
finland
amounted
to
terawatt
hours
twh
which
corresponded
to
per
cent
of
its
total
electricity
consumption
about
twh
were
imported
from
russia
