a

may
entice
even
more
interest
analysts
say
decio
oddone
director
of
brazilian
oil
regulator
anp
said
he
expected
it
to
be
the
first
auction
where
all
blocks
are
sold
meaning
an
injection
of
billion
reais
million
pounds
into
brazil
s
government
brazil
has
a
history
of
respecting
contracts
and
the
assets
are
appealing
said
oddone
brushing
off
concerns
about
a
possible
impact
on
the
auction
from
a
fresh
wave
of
government
meddling
in
fuel
prices
at
oil
company
petrobras
a
truckers
strike
over
higher
diesel
prices
paralysed
commerce
in
brazil
last
month
prompting
the
government
to
announce
measures
to
cut
prices
for
the
fuel
this
fanned
fears
of
more
government
interference
at
petrobras
and
sent
its
chief
executive
officer
packing
under
current
brazilian
rules
petrobras
will
likely
serve
as
operator
and
take
at
least
a
percent
stake
in
all
blocks
it
expresses
an
interest
in
