has
engulfed
two
entire
seaside
housing
tracts
at
the
eastern
tip
of
hawaii
s
big
island
government
scientists
reported
on
wednesday
an
area
where
civil
defense
officials
said
nearly
homes
once
stood
the
obliteration
of
the
kapoho
beach
lots
and
vacationland
subdivisions
by
a
churning
river
of
molten
rock
some
to
feet
to
meters
tall
brings
to
at
least
the
number
of
homes
and
other
structures
consumed
by
volcanic
lava
during
the
past
month
that
latest
toll
of
property
losses
from
kilauea
s
ongoing
upheaval
which
entered
its
day
on
wednesday
far
surpasses
the
structures
destroyed
by
lava
during
all
years
of
the
volcano
s
last
eruption
cycle
which
began
in

at
the
edge
of
a
small
shallow
inlet
called
kapoho
bay
lava
pouring
into
the
ocean
there
has
completely
filled
in
the
bay
extending
nearly
a
mile
km
out
from
what
had
been
the
shoreline

said
plumes
of
white
steam
and
hydrochloric
acid
fumes
a
vaporous
corrosive
mix
formed
from
lava
reacting
with
seawater
as
it
enters
the
ocean
could
be
seen
rising
from
a
distance
authorities
began
evacuating
the
greater
kapoho
area
last
week
and
ushered
most
of
the
last
remaining
residents
to
safety
early
on
saturday
hours
before
the
lava
flow
severed
all
road
access
to
the
region
i
just
locked
my
doors
and
walked

resident
who
headed
the
neighborhood
watch
organization
there
it
s
an
emotional
roller
the
river
of
lava
then
spread
out
into
a
towering
blob
about
a
meters
wide
as
it
crept
through
the
flat
open
landscape
of
the
subdivisions
swallowing
everything
in
its
path
over
the
following
few
days
a
handful
of
residents
who
initially
stayed
behind
rather
than
heed
the
evacuation
order
were
airlifted
by
helicopter
on
sunday
officials
said
several
miles
km
west
of
kapoho
bay
another
structures
mostly
homes
were
destroyed
weeks
ago
in
the
leilani
estates
community
where
fissures
in
the
ground
first
opened
on
may
on
the
volcano
s
lower
flank
according
to
civil
defense
officials
most
of
the
two
dozen
volcanic
vents
have
grown
largely
quiet
over
the
past
week
with
just
one
fissure
still
spewing
large
volumes
of
molten
rock
from
the
ground
as
of
wednesday
the
usgs
said
fissure
is
the
origin
of
the
lava
flow
that
devastated
the
kapoho
area
lava
had
covered
nearly
square
miles
sq
km
of
landscape
as
of
monday
and
some
earthquakes
had
been
recorded
on
the
big
island
since
kilauea
rumbled
back
to
life
last
month
that
s
nearly
times
the
monthly
historic
average
for
seismic
activity
on
