recovery
workers
with
cadaver
dogs
pressed
on
with
their
search
for
more
victims
in
a
northern
california
town
on
friday
as
authorities
sought
clues
to
the
fate
of
more
than
people
reported
missing
in
the
deadliest
wildfire
in
state
history
remains
of
at
least
people
have
been
recovered
so
far
in
and
around
the
sierra
foothills
hamlet
of
paradise
which
was
home
to
nearly
residents
before
the
town
was
largely
incinerated
by
the
deadly
camp
fire
on
the
night
of
more
than
a
week
later
firefighters
have
managed
to
carve
containment
lines
around
percent
of
the
blaze
s
perimeter
up
from
percent
a
day
earlier
even
as
the
burned
landscape
grew
slightly
to
acres
hectares
besides
the
staggering
toll
on
human
life
property
losses
from
the
blaze
make
it
california
s
most
the
destructive
on
record
posing
a
challenge
of
providing
shelter
for
many
thousands
of
displaced
residents
with
nearly
homes
and
buildings
up
in
smoke
many
refugees
from
the
fire
have
taken
up
temporary
residence
with
friends
and
family
while
others
have
pitched
tents
or
were
camping
out
of
their
vehicles
more
than
evacuees
were
being
housed
in
emergency
shelters
set
up
in
churches
schools
and
community
centers
around
the
region
american
red
cross
spokeswoman
greta
gustafson
said
search
teams
meanwhile
combed
through
charred
expanses
of
neighborhoods
looking
for
bodies
or
anything
else
that
might
carry
human
dna
for
identification
purposes
on
thursday
night
butte
county
sheriff
kory
honea
said
the
official
roster
of
people
reported
unaccounted
for
by
loved
ones
had
grown
to
more
than
double
the
number
counted
as
missing
earlier
in
the
day
meanwhile
the
remains
of
seven
more
people
were
found
bringing
the
death
toll
to
he
said
sheriff
s
spokeswoman
miranda
bowersox
said
the
list
would
likely
fluctuate
greatly
the
overall
number
will
go
down
but
in
the
short
term
we
expect
we
will
see
new
reports
of
people
missing
she
said
some
of
those
still
unaccounted
for
have
likely
survived
but
not
yet
notified
family
or
authorities
that
they
are
alive
either
because
they
lack
telephone
service
or
are
unaware
anyone
is
looking
for
them
on
the
other
hand
there
may
be
some
people
who
perished
but
whose
relatives
have
yet
to
report
them
missing
communication
disruptions
after
the
fire
have
added
to
the
confusion
the
disaster
already
ranks
among
the
deadliest
wildfires
in
the
united
states
since
the
turn
of
the
last
century
authorities
attribute
the
death
toll
partly
to
the
speed
with
which
flames
raced
through
the
town
with
little
advance
warning
driven
by
howling
winds
and
fueled
by
scrub
and
trees
weather
conditions
have
since
turned
more
favorable
to
the
firefighting
effort
nick
pimlott
a
cal
fire
engineer
told
he
said
winds
had
died
down
allowing
crews
around
lake
oroville
to
the
southeast
of
paradise
to
extend
and
shore
up
containment
lines
around
the
blaze
many
on
the
list
are
over
the
age
of
in
keeping
with
the
town
s
recent
history
as
a
haven
for
retirees
family
of
retired
navy
veteran
david
marbury
have
not
heard
from
him
since
the
wildfire
erupted
on
thursday
marbury
s
landlord
confirmed
to
relatives
that
his
paradise
duplex
had
burned
down
his
car
was
still
in
the
garage
i
really
hope
he
s

alive
and
we

going

able
to

sam

many
more
than
california
national

troops
have
been
deployed

the
fire
zone
to
help

for
victims
and
to
fill
logistical
medical
and
administrative
roles
lieutenant
colonel
christopher
angle
said
seven
soldiers
from
his
battalion
lost
their
homes
in
the
fire
including
one
woman
who
asked
to
help
with
the
recovery
effort
because
it
was
better
for
her
piece
of
mind
to
be
part
of
the
camp
fire
coincided
with
a
series
of
smaller
blazes
in
southern
california
most
notably
the
woolsey
fire
which
is
linked
to
three
fatalities
and
has
destroyed
at
least
structures
near
the
malibu
coast
west
of
los
angeles
it
was
percent
contained
on
friday
scientists
have
said
the
growing
frequency
and
intensity
of
wildfires
in
california
and
elsewhere
across
the
west
are
largely
attributable
to
prolonged
drought
that
is
symptomatic
of
climate
change
president
donald
trump
is
due
to
visit
the
fire
zones
on
saturday
to
meet
displaced
residents
critics
say
trump
a
republican
has
politicized
the
fires
by
blaming
them
without
supporting
evidence
on
forest
mismanagement
by
california
governor
jerry
brown
and
gavin
