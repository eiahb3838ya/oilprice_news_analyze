in
the
charred
wreckage
of
the
northern
california
town
of

on
saturday
as
the
number
of
people
listed
as
missing
in

topped
remains

at

people
have

around
the

miles

to
nearly
residents
before
it
was
largely
incinerated
by
the
blaze
on
the
night
of
the
disaster
already
ranks
among
the
deadliest
wildfires
since
the
turn
of
the
last
century
people
perished
in
the
big
burn
firestorm
that
swept
the
northern
rockies
in

fire
in

of
killed
people
president
donald
trump
who
has
blamed
the
recent
spate
of
fires
on
forest
mismanagement
was
due
to
visit
the
fire
zones
on
saturday
to
meet
displaced
residents
governor
jerry
brown
and
gavin
newsom
planned
to
join
trump
on
his
tour
authorities
attribute
the
high
death
toll
from
the
blaze
dubbed
camp
fire
partly
to
the
speed
with
which
flames
raced
through
the
town
with
little
advance
warning
driven
by
howling
winds
and
fueled
by
scrub
and
trees
more
than
a
week
later
firefighters
have
managed
to
carve
containment
lines
around
percent
of
the
blaze
s
perimeter
the
fire
covered
acres
hectares
fire
officials
said
besides
the
toll
on
human
life
property
losses
from
the
blaze
make
it
the
most
destructive
in
california
history
posing
the
additional
challenge
of
providing
shelter
for
many
thousands
of
displaced
residents
with
more
than
homes
up
in
smoke
many
refugees
have
taken
up
temporary
residence
with
friends
and
family
while
others
have
pitched
tents
or
were
camping
out
of
their
vehicles
at
least
evacuees
were
being
housed
in
emergency
shelters
set
up
in
churches
schools
and
community
centers
around
the
region
with
a
total
of
more
than
people
remaining
under
evacuation
orders
authorities
said
search
teams
with
cadaver
dogs
combed
through
expanses
of
neighborhoods
looking
for
bodies
on
friday
night
butte
county
sheriff
kory
honea
said
the
remains
of
eight
more
fire
victims
were
recovered
during
the
day
bringing
the
death
toll
to
that
surpasses
the
previous
fatality
record
from
a
single
california
wildfire
in
the
griffith
park
fire
of
in
los
angeles
honea
said
the
total
roster
of
people
unaccounted
for
had
swelled
to
up
from
the
names
posted
thursday
night
and
well
more
than
triple
the
number
counted
as
missing
on
thursday
afternoon
this
is
a
dynamic
list
honea
told
reporters
saying
it
was
compiled
from
raw
data
that
likely
included
some
duplications
or
multiple
spellings
of
names
honea
bristled
when
asked
whether
many
of
those
listed
at
this
point
more
than
a
week
after
the
disaster
were
expected
to
end
up
either
deceased
or
declared
missing
and
presumed
dead
i
don
t
think
it
s
appropriate
for
any
of
us
to
sit
and
speculate
about
what
the
future
holds
he
said
as
of
friday
he
said
individuals
previously
reported
missing
had
turned
up
alive
the
names
were
being
compiled
from
information
received
from
a
special
hotline
along
with
email
reports
and
a
review
of
calls
that
came
in
on
the
first
night
of
the
fire
honea
said
some
listed
have
likely
survived
but
not
yet
notified
family
or
authorities
others
may
not
have
been
immediately
listed
because
of
delays
in
reporting
them
weather
conditions
have
since
turned
more
to
firefighters
favor
though
strong
gusty
winds
and
lower
humidity
were
expected
to
return
late
saturday
through
early
sunday
ahead
of
rain
showers
forecast
for
the
outbreak
of
camp
fire
coincided
with
a
series
of
smaller
blazes
in
southern
california
most
notably
the
woolsey
fire
which
is
linked
to
three
fatalities
and
has
destroyed
at
least
structures
near
the
malibu
coast
west
of
los
angeles
it
was
percent
contained
on
friday
night
scientists
have
said
the
growing
frequency
and
intensity
of
wildfires
in
california
and
elsewhere
across
the
west
are
largely
attributable
to
prolonged
drought
that
is
symptomatic
of
climate
change
the
precise
causes
of
the
camp
and
woolsey
fires
were
under
investigation
but
electric
utilities
have
reported
equipment
problems
in
the
vicinity
of
both
blazes
around
the
time
they
erupted
