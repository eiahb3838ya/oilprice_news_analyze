president
donald
trump
launched
a
sharp
public
attack
on
germany
on
wednesday
for
supporting
a
baltic
sea
gas
pipeline
deal
with
russia
saying
berlin
had
become
a
captive
to
russia
and
he
criticised
it
for
failing
to
raise
defence
spending
more
trump
meeting
reporters
with
nato
jens
stoltenberg
before
a
nato
summit
in
brussels
said
it
was
very
inappropriate
that
the
united
states
was
paying
for
european
defence
against
russia
while
germany
the
biggest
european
economy
was
supporting
gas
deals
with
moscow
trump
was
due
to
meet
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
at
the
summit
later
in
the
day
and
will
meet
russian
president
vladimir
putin
in
helsinki
on
monday
berlin
has
given
political
support
to
the
building
of
a
new
pipeline
to
bring
russian
gas
across
the
baltic
sea
called
nord
stream
despite
qualms
among
other
eu
states
however
merkel
insists
the
project
is
a
private
commercial
venture
and
is
not
funded
by
german
taxpayers
when
germany
makes
a
massive
oil
and
gas
deal
with
russia
trump
said
to
stoltenberg
we
re
supposed
to
be
guarding
against
russia
and
germany
goes
out
and
pays
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
a
year
to
russia
we
re
protecting
germany
we
re
protecting
france
we
re
protecting
all
of
these
countries
and
then
numerous
of
the
countries
go
out
and
make
a
pipeline
deal
with
russia
where
they
re
paying
billions
of
dollars
into
the
coffers
of
russia
so
we
re
supposed
to
protect
you
against
russia
and
you
pay
billions
of
dollars
to
russia
and
i
think
that
s
very
inappropriate
trump
said
at
the
residence
of
the
ambassador
in
brussels
germany
will
have
almost
percent
of
their
country
controlled
by
russia
with
natural
gas
you
tell
me
is
that
appropriate
he
asked
while
stoltenberg
listened
at
one
point
the
former
norwegian
prime
minister
pointed
out
that
the
nato
allies
in
europe
disagreed
among
themselves
on
ways
to
reduce
the
continent
s
reliance
on
russian
gas
germany
is
totally
controlled
by
russia
cause
they
are
getting
to
percent
of
their
energy
from
russia
and
a
new
trump
renewed
his
call
for
other
nato
allies
to
pay
in
more
to
the
western
alliance
after
years
in
which
taxpayers
have
he
said
borne
an
unfair
share
of
military
spending
i
think
these
countries
have
to
step
it
up
not
over
a
year
period
they
have
to
step
it
up
immediately
germany
is
a
rich
country
they
talk
about
increasing
it
a
tiny
bit
by
well
they
could
increase
it
immediately
tomorrow
and
have
no
problem
trump
said
if
you
look
at
it
germany
is
a
captive
of
russia
they
got
rid
of
their
coal
plants
they
got
rid
of
their
nuclear
they
re
getting
so
much
of
their
oil
and
gas
from
russia
i
think
it
is
something
nato
has
to
look
at
it
is
very
reporting
