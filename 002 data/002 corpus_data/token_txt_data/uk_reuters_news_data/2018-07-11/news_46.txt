libya
s
national
oil
corp
noc
said
on
wednesday
that
four
export
terminals
were
being
reopened
after
eastern
factions
handed
over
the
ports
ending
a
standoff
that
had
shut
down
most
of
the
country
s
oil
output
production
and
export
operations
would
be
restored
within
the
next
few
hours
an
noc
statement
said
though
the
restart
at
es
sider
and
ras
lanuf
where
workers
were
evacuated
and
storage
tanks
damaged
in
fighting
last
month
was
expected
to
be
gradual
eastern
factions
had
effectively
blockaded
exports
from
the
territory
they
control
since
last
month
saying
too
much
oil
revenue
processed
through
tripoli
was
going
to
armed
groups
based
in
western
libya
including
their
rivals
the
disruption
had
threatened
to
keep
offline
as
much
as
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
libyan
oil
from
previous
production
of
a
little
over
million
bpd
it
also
risked
deepening
a
wedge
between
rival
political
and
military
alliances
based
in
eastern
and
western
libya
since
disputed
elections
four
years
ago
and
complicating
efforts
to
end
years
of
turmoil
following
the
country
s
uprising
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
ports
were
shut
when
armed
opponents
of
commander
khalifa
haftar
attacked
them
on
june
the
assault
was
repelled
a
week
later
but
eastern
officials
aligned
with
haftar
blocked
the
internationally
recognised
noc
in
tripoli
from
reentering
the
ports
and
stopped
loadings
at
zueitina
and
hariga
terminals
saying
they
would
take
control
of
exports
through
a
parallel
noc
based
in
the
east
noc
tripoli
announced
the
ports
had
been
restored
to
its
control
early
on
wednesday
allowing
it
to
lift
force
majeure
a
legal
waiver
on
contractual
obligations
at
all
four
terminals
it
commended
haftar
s
libyan
national
army
for
putting
the
national
interest
first
by
handing
them
back
eastern
oil
facilities
guards
and
the
head
of
the
parallel
noc
faraj
said
confirmed
the
ports
were
reopening
although
said
told
reuters
that
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
which
have
been
damaged
in
repeated
rounds
of
fighting
required
maintenance
the
ports
of
zueitina
and
hariga
are
now
open
for
any
tankers
carrying
a
contract
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
need
some
maintenance
he
said
over
the
past
two
weeks
eastern
factions
had
come
under
intense
international
pressure
to
end
the
stoppage
according
to
diplomatic
sources
in
an
apparent
concession
to
the
east
the
internationally
recognised
government
of
national
accord
in
tripoli
called
late
on
tuesday
for
the
formation
of
an
international
committee
that
could
review
the
spending
of
rising
oil
revenues
noc
tripoli
chairman
mustafa
sanalla
said
the
debate
over
fair
distribution
of
oil
revenues
was
at
the
heart
of
the
recent
crisis
the
real
solution
is
transparency
so
i
renew
my
call
on
the
responsible
authorities
the
ministry
of
finance
and
central
bank
to
publish
budgets
and
detailed
public
expenditure
