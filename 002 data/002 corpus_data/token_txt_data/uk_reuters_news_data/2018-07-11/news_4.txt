the

acting
chief
said
on
wednesday
he
would
push
to
cut

on
industry
and
speed
up

on
permits
echoing
the
policies
of
former
head
scott
pruitt
who
stepped
down
last
week
andrew
wheeler
a
longtime
washington

took
the
reins
on

resigned
over
more
than
a
dozen
ethics
controversies
unlike
pruitt
wheeler
has
been
known
to
shun
the
spotlight
but
some
environmentalists
say
his
experience
means
he
can
carry
out
trump
s
policy
of
slashing
regulations
more
effectively
wheeler
said
president
donald
trump
talked
to
him
last
week
and
asked
him
to
provide
regulatory
relief
to
industry
while
protecting
air
and
water
quality
i
think
we
can
do
all
three
of
those
things
at
the
same
time
wheeler
said
in
his
first
address
to
epa
staff
environmentalists
have
complained
that
the
epa
under
trump
has
worked
to
reverse
obama
era
limits
on
pollution
wheeler
worked
at
the
epa
in
the
and
later
in
the
senate
under
senator
jim
inhofe
a
skeptic
of
mainstream
climate
science
before
moving
to
the
private
sector
as
a
lobbyist
and
consultant
he
said
that
he
was
not
at
all
ashamed
of
more
recent
lobbying
for
the
coal
company
murray
energy
corp
the
focus
of
criticism
by
environmentalists
his
top
issue
in
work
for
murray
was
the
miners
protection
act
shoring
up
pension
and
healthcare
benefits
for
united
mine
worker
retirees
said
wheeler
whose
grandfather
was
a
coal
miner

has
pressured
the
trump

to
ease

utility
xcel

the

wheeler

continuing
pruitt
s
goal

bringing
the
agency

to
wheeler
also
pledged
to
speed
up
permitting
setting
a
goal
of
issuing
decisions
on
all
permits
before
the
agency
in
six
months
he
said
this
would
ease
uncertainty
for
small
businesses
left
unmentioned
was
pruitt
s
final
move
at
the
agency
to
undo
rules
on
refurbished
trucks
known
as
gliders
which
environmentalists
say
generate
as
much
as
times
the
pollution
of
modern
engines
like
pruitt
wheeler
believes
the
epa
in
the
previous
administration
of
barack
obama
overstepped
federal
clean
air
law
by
issuing
rules
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
wheeler
who
had
been
confirmed
by
the
senate
to
serve
as
pruitt
s
deputy
will
deal
with
issues
including
replacing
the
clean
power
plan
requirements
of
biofuels
mixed
into
gasoline
and
diesel
and
whether
the
epa
chief
has
a
role
in
promoting
exports
on
monday
after
pressure
from
industry
for
regulatory
certainty
the
epa
sent
a
rule
to
reduce
greenhouse
emissions
from
power
plants
to
the
white
house
s
office
of
management
and
budget
for
review
it
is
expected
to
be
more
industry
friendly
than
the
clean
power
plan
the
epa
will
open
the
rule
to
public
comment
after
the
omb
reviews
it
it
is
not
yet
known
if
trump
will
nominate
wheeler
to
replace
pruitt
permanently
if
he
does
the
senate
would
again
have
to
confirm
him
