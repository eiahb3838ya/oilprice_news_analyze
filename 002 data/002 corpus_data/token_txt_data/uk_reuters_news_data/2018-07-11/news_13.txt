update 9-trump calls germany "captive" of russia; demands higher defence spending
brussels
reuters
president
donald
trump
accused
germany
on
wednesday
of
being
a
captive
of
russia
due
to
its
energy
reliance
before
a
nato
summit
where
he
pressed
allies
to
more
than
double
defence
spending
having
lambasted
nato
members
for
failing
to
reach
a
target
of
spending
percent
of
national
income
on
defence
trump
told
fellow
leaders
in
brussels
he
would
prefer
a
goal
of
percent
similar
to
levels
officials
said
that
would
represent
a
massive
upheaval
of
budgetary
priorities
in
europe
where
germany
and
many
others
have
pledged
only
to
reach
percent
by
or
later
and
it
was
not
clear
what
allies
would
spend
the
money
on
at
the
end
of
the
first
session
of
a
summit
nato
jens
stoltenberg
said
the
aim
first
was
to
reach
percent
but
moments
later
trump
tweeted
that
allies
were
undercutting
the
united
states
on
trade
and
needed
to
immediately
up
spending
the
exchange
was
part
of
an
uncomfortable
day
as
anxious
western
allies
were
subjected
to
the
president
s
america
first
approach
his
comment
that
germany
was
controlled
by
russia
earned
a
rebuke
from
berlin
we
are
not
prisoners
neither
of
russia
nor
of
the
united
states
germany
s
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
told
reporters
but
trump
was
also
at
times
enthusiastic
and
affable
exchanging
embraces
and
handshakes
with
fellow
leaders
posing
for
photographs
in
front
of
a
nato
military
band
and
mingling
at
a
summit
dinner
in
a
brussels
museum
unlike
a
fraught
group
of
seven
summit
in
canada
in
june
trump
did
not
block
a
final
leaders
statement
which
paved
the
way
for
macedonia
to
start
nato
membership
talks
and
a
modernisation
of
the
alliance
to
better
deter
moscow
earlier
trump
strode
into
nato
s
new
headquarters
and
into
the
north
atlantic
council
chamber
to
shake
hands
with
leaders
but
only
after
publicly
railing
against
germany
one
of
nato
s
top
european
powers
at
a
breakfast
meeting
with
stoltenberg
trump
told
stoltenberg
germany
was
wrong
to
support
an
baltic
sea
pipeline
to
import
even
more
russian
gas
while
being
slow
to
meet
targets
for
nato
spending
we
re
supposed
to
be
guarding
against
russia
and
germany
goes
out
and
pays
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
a
year
to
russia
trump
said
in
the
presence
of
reporters
we
re
protecting
germany
we
re
protecting
france
we
re
protecting
all
of
these
countries
and
then
numerous
of
the
countries
go
out
and
make
a
pipeline
deal
with
russia
where
they
re
paying
billions
of
dollars
into
the
coffers
of
russia
he
said
i
think
that
s
very
trump
appeared
to
substantially
overstate
german
reliance
on
russian
energy
and
to
imply
berlin
was
funding
a
pipeline
that
chancellor
angela
merkel
says
is
a
commercial
venture
she
hit
back
by
contrasting
her
own
experience
of
growing
up
in
east
germany
with
the
sovereign
united
germany
now
playing
a
major
role
in
nato
trump
and
merkel
later
held
businesslike
talks
on
the
sidelines
trump
said
he
had
a
very
very
good
relationship
with
merkel
who
described
the
two
as
good
partners
a
source
close
to
french
president
emmanuel
macron
said
trump
had
voiced
his
personal
attachment
to
europe
and
gave
rather
positive
and
constructive
messages
to
his
allies
there
is
no
between
america
and
europe
the
source
said
after
macron
and
trump
held
friendly
talks
but
with
tensions
in
the
alliance
smouldering
over
trump
s
trade
tariffs
on
european
steel
his
earlier
comments
fuelled
concerns
about
the
role
in
keeping
the
peace
that
has
reigned
since
world
war
two
belgian
prime
minister
charles
michel
called
for
fair
play
and
more
respect
for
multilateralism
baltic
leaders
fearful
of
any
repeat
of
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
called
for
unity
while
slovak
president
andre
kiska
said
his
country
was
one
of
the
good
guys
because
it
was
increasing
defence
spending
those
comments
underscored
the
risks
to
trump
s
strategy
by
dividing
allies
between
those
who
spend
more
on
defence
and
those
who
do
not
such
as
belgium
spain
italy
and
luxembourg
but
who
contribute
with
troops
to
nato
missions
nato
s
stoltenberg
later
told
reporters
that
trump
who
will
meet
russian
president
vladimir
putin
on
monday
had
used
very
direct
language
but
that
nato
spending
was
rising
strongly
the
nato
chief
was
also
frank
about
the
impact
of
trump
s
stance
at
a
broader
level
there
are
disagreements
on
trade
this
is
serious
my
task
is
to
try
to
minimise
the
negative
impact
on
nato
he
said
so
far
it
hasn
t
impacted
on
nato
that
much
i
can
not
guarantee
that
that
will
not
be
the
case
in
the
future
the
transatlantic
bond
is
not
one
there
are
many
ties
some
of
them
have
been
