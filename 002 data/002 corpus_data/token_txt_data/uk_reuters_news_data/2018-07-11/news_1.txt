mexico

reuters
mexico
s
next
energy
agenda
will
prioritize
increasing
gasoline
and
diesel
production
and
later
decide
on
possible
changes
to
the
industry
reform
championed
by
the
outgoing
government
according
to
a
top
aide
to
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
rocio
nahle
tapped
by
lopez
obrador
to
be
energy
minister
told
local
outlet
aristegui
noticias
on
wednesday
that
the
country
s
next
government
will
address
the
energy
imbalance
in
which
mexico
produces
less
fuel
at
home
and
turns
to
imports
to
meet
national
demand
lopez
obrador
won
a
landslide
victory
in
the
july
election
and
will
take
office
in
december
we
will
be
assessing
if
any
legislative
changes
to
the
oil
opening
are
necessary
said
nahle
adding
that
the
transition
team
would
not
immediately
propose
changes
to
the
existing
laws
the
comments
by
nahle
who
also
won
a
senate
seat
in
the
election
are
in
line
with
lopez
obrador
s
pledge
last
weekend
to
end
mexico
s
massive
fuel
imports
over
the
first
three
years
of
his
term
so
far
this
year
mexico
has
imported
an
average
of
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
gasoline
and
another
bpd
of
diesel
almost
all
of
it
from
the
united
states
as
gasoline
output
at
the
country
s
six
refineries
owned
and
operated
by
pemex
has
halved
since
the
first
year
of
outgoing
president
enrique
pena
nieto
s
term
domestic
gasoline
output
barely
meets
a
quarter
of
national
demand
from
the
country
s
legions
of
motorists
during
the
election
campaign
lopez
obrador
was
sharply
critical
of
the
pena
nieto
s
policy
to
allow
foreign
and
private
oil
companies
to
operate
fields
on
their
own
for
the
first
time
in
decades
ending
pemex
s
monopoly
the
overhaul
was
designed
to
reverse
a
oil
output
slide
and
has
already
resulted
in
competitive
auctions
that
have
awarded
more
than
exploration
and
production
contracts
deals
lopez
obrador
has
repeatedly
promised
to
review
for
signs
of
corruption
nahle
said
the
next
government
will
also
begin
construction
of
at
least
one
new
oil
refinery
which
she
expects
to
be
operating
by
the
halfway
point
of
lopez
obrador
s
term
so
far
this
year
pemex
s
existing
refineries
are
producing
an
average
of
bpd
of
gasoline
and
about
bpd
of
diesel
