epa scraps detailed plan to force u.s. refiners to blend more biofuels
new
york
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
ditched
a
detailed
plan
that
would
have
forced
refiners
to
blend
more
biofuels
into
their
gasoline
and
diesel
in
to
compensate
for
volumes
likely
to
be
exempted
under
the
agency
s
small
refinery
hardship
waiver
program
according
to
newly
released
epa
documents
the
plan
would
have
boosted
the
renewable
fuel
blending
obligation
for
the
refining
industry
to
percent
from
percent
to
offset
volumes
lost
under
the
waiver
program
which
has
been
expanded
sharply
under
president
donald
trump
s
epa
and
keep
overall
blended
volumes
on
target
the
idea
was
aimed
at
assuaging
the
powerful
corn
lobby
which
has
accused
trump
s
epa
of
undermining
demand
for
biofuels
like
ethanol
through
the
waiver
program
but
was
scrapped
amid
intense
protest
from
the
refining
industry
what
this
shows
is
the
epa
acknowledges
it
has
the
authority
and
the
ability
to
reallocate
the
volumes
lost
under
the
small
refinery
exemption
program
geoff
cooper
an
executive
at
the
renewable
fuels
association
said
on
wednesday
the
epa
said
the
documents
reflect
the
agency
s
process
for
administering
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
which
is
done
in
conjunction
with
the
departments
of
energy
and
agriculture
as
well
as
the
white
house
the
move
would
have
likely
rallied
compliance
credit
prices
that
have
plunged
to
lows
amid
reports
of
the
agency
s
expansion
of
the
waiver
program
under
the
rfs
the
epa
must
set
annual
requirements
for
the
volume
of
renewable
fuels
that
oil
refiners
and
other
fuel
companies
must
blend
with
their
products
the
policy
has
been
a
source
of
contention
between
powerful
corn
and
oil
lobbies
in
washington
the
agency
also
has
the
power
to
exempt
smaller
refineries
from
the
blending
requirements
if
they
can
prove
that
complying
with
the
regulation
would
cause
them
financial
stress
the
epa
under
director
scott
pruitt
has
roughly
tripled
the
number
of
exemptions
granted
to
small
refiners
angering
midwest
farmers
and
their
legislative
backers
who
say
he
effectively
lowered
the
annual
biofuels
mandate
exemptions
representing
some
million
gallons
worth
of
biofuel
were
granted
for
and
according
to
the
epa
that
includes
waivers
covering
million
compliance
credits
called
rins
in
the
epa
said
under
the
scrapped
plan
the
epa
would
have
estimated
the
number
of
gallons
of
gasoline
and
diesel
that
would
likely
be
exempted
in
under
the
small
refinery
waiver
program
and
force
the
larger
refineries
to
make
up
the
difference
the
epa
projected
some
billion
gallons
of
gasoline
and
billion
gallons
of
diesel
produced
by
small
refiners
would
be
exempt
from
the
requirements
in
the
documents
showed
the
documents
were
published
by
the
epa
as
part
of
requirements
aimed
at
providing
the
public
more
insight
into
federal
decision
making
reuters
and
other
news
outlets
reported
on
the
epa
s
volumes
proposal
but
the
documents
provide
new
details
about
the
agency
s
approach
the
proposed
changes
came
in
a
june
email
from
tia
sutton
of
the
epa
to
the
white
house
office
of
management
and
budget
pruitt
who
resigned
amid
ethics
scandals
last
week
had
just
returned
from
a
midwest
tour
where
he
met
with
farmers
angry
over
his
expansion
of
the
exemption
program
a
day
later
some
legal
justification
was
added
to
the
proposed
rule
stating
this
approach
is
consistent
with
the
text
of
our
regulations
which
accounts
for
the
amount
of
gasoline
and
amount
of
diesel
projected
to
be
produced
by
exempt
small
refineries
in
refiners
learned
of
the
changes
and
made
a
press
to
the
agency
and
white
house
to
reverse
it
senators
ted
cruz
of
texas
and
pat
toomey
of
pennsylvania
both
republicans
had
calls
with
pruitt
a
day
after
reports
of
the
changes
circulated
according
to
pruitt
s
public
schedule
on
june
the
epa
struck
the
changes
in
a
new
email
to
the
omb
office
the
documents
showed
the
final
proposed
rule
was
