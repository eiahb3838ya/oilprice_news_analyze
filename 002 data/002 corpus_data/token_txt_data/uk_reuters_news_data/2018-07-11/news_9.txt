ramaphosa
told
the

nigeria
and
south
africa
have
the
two
largest
economies
in
africa
along
with
angola
they
make
up
about
of
africa
s
annual
economic
output
both
countries
have
been
hit
hard
in
recent
years
by
low
commodity
prices
that
slowed
growth
cut
government
revenues
and
weakened
their
currencies
but
each
has
emerged
from
recession
largely
because
of
a
rebound
in
commodity
prices
the
growth
of
the
two
economies
played
a
large
part
in
the
world

by
countries
in
march
south
africa
signed
up
earlier
this
month
six
countries
including
nigeria
are
yet
to
sign
the
agreement
economists
point
to
the
continent
s
low
level
of
trade
as
one
of
the
reasons
for
africa
s
enduring
poverty
and
lack
of
a
strong
manufacturing
base
african
union
officials
said
countries
that
have
signed
the
agreement
will
need
to
submit
a
schedule
of
tariffs
by
december
adding
that
they
expect
trade
to
double
over
the
next
four
years
once
tariffs
are
reduced
