the

had
earned
billion
libyan
dinars
billion
in
oil
revenue
in
the
first
six
months
of
the
year
accounting
for
more
than
percent
of
total
income
and
more
than
double
the
billion
dinars
earned
from
oil
in
the
first
half
of
total
spending
was
billion
dinars
a
little
more
than
total
revenue
of
billion
the
tripoli
based
cbl
said
in
a
statement
figures
released
by
the
cbl
serve
only
as
a
rough
guide
to
overall
spending
in
libya
as
the
country
has
been
politically
and
economically
divided
since
with
a
rival
central
bank
operating
in
the
eastern
town
of
bayda
that
has
thrown
the
economy
into
crisis
contributing
to
a
liquidity
crisis
and
a
sharp
drop
in
living
standards
oil
revenues
which
have
been
boosted
by
higher
production
and
rising
prices
and
most
salary
payments
have
continued
to
be
processed
through
the
cbl
in
tripoli
and
the
two
central
banks
are
meant
to
be
using
a
single
joint
budget
this
year
the
tripoli
cbl
said
public
salary
payments
made
up
percent
of
spending
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
and
subsidies
percent
salary
payments
would
rise
by
billion
dinars
in
due
to
the
inclusion
of
salaries
under
the
eastern
government
it
said
the
cbl
also
listed
spending
in
dollars
including
an
allocation
of
billion
for
the
national
oil
corporation
noc
and
billion
in
family
allowances
the
allowances
are
a
mechanism
for
trying
to
inject
dollars
into
the
market
and
reduce
the
gap
between
a
fixed
official
exchange
rate
of
dinars
to
the
dollar
and
the
black
market
rate
of
around
dinars
with
oil
production
and
prices
rising
since
last
year
the
tripoli
cbl
and
the
internationally
recognised
government
of
national
accord
gna
in
the
capital
have
been
under
pressure
to
increase
transparency
about
how
libya
s
oil
money
is
spent
eastern
factions
have
complained
that
too
much
goes
to
tripoli
s
powerful
militias
and
to
the
east
s
armed
rivals
the
stated
reason
that
eastern
officials
shut
down
oil
exports
from
several
terminals
last
month
blocking
most
of
libya
s
oil
production
on
tuesday
the
gna
appealed
to
the
security
council
to
form
a
technical
committee
that
could
review
the
expenditure
revenues
and
transactions
of
the
central
banks
in
tripoli
and
bayda
the
tripoli
cbl
said
it
would
welcome
such
a
move
the
central
bank
declares
its
full
readiness
to
cooperate
with
any
committee
in
this
regard
