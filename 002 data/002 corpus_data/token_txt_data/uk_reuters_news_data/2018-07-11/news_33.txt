a

the

he
also
said
the
city
s
measures
such
as
an
expansion
of
public
transportation
and
electric
mobility
would
need
to
have
a
sufficient
effect
on
pollution
levels
there
has
been
a
global
backlash
against
cars
since
volkswagen
admitted
in
to
cheating
exhaust
tests
meant
to
limit
emissions
of
particulate
matter
and
nitrogen
oxide
nox
dozens
of
german
cities
including

munich
and
stuttgart
exceed
european

does
not
look
like
the
measures
stuttgart
has
taken
to
improve
air
quality
will
bring
its
nox
levels
within
the
legal
limits
the
ban
could
be
widened
to
diesels
in
january
the
ministry
said
germany
s
top
administrative
court
ruled
in
february
in
favor
of
allowing
major
cities
to
ban
heavily
polluting
diesel
cars
soon
after
hamburg
became
the
first
german
city
to
ban
diesel
cars
that
do
not
meet
the
latest
standards
from
some
busy
streets
seeking
to
raise
pressure
on
carmakers
to
undertake
costly
retrofits
a
regional
court
in
stuttgart
had
demanded
last
month
the
state
of
home
to
carmakers
and
vw

porsche
draw
up
a
firm
plan
for
when
it
will
ban

diesel
vehicles
from

are
also
planned
in
paris
madrid
mexico
city
and
