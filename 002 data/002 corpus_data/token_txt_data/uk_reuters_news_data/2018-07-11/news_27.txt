july
reuters
a
refinery
in
saudi
arabia
has
shipped
its
rbob
gasoline
to
the
united
states
for
the
first
time
a
potential
precursor
for
more
deliveries
to
a
region
where
prices
are
currently
at
seasonal
highs
the
jubail
satorp
refinery
a
joint
venture
between
saudi
aramco
and
french
company
total
said
in
its
verified
twitter
account
that
it
sent
the
shipment
of
reformulated
blendstock
gasoline
commonly
called
rbob
to
the
united
states
it
did
not
say
whether
those
barrels
had
arrived
yet
and
its
exact
destination
was
unclear
the
shipment
is
unusual
because
when
satorp
was
founded
in
it
was
not
expected
to
send
rbob
to
the
united
states
as
saudi
gasoline
demand
remained
strong

motor
gasoline
inventories
in
the
united
states
fell
to
about
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
july
according
to
energy
department
data
stockpiles
were
up
from
the
same
time
last
year
when
inventories
totaled
million
barrels
market
participants
expect
the
additional
supply
could
slow
inventory
drawdowns
rbob
prices
have
been
trading
at
seasonal
highs
as
crude
has
rallied
in
the
midst
of
the
busy
summer
driving
season
cash
prices
for
the
product
in
new
york
harbor
were
at
cents
per
gallon
above
the
futures
benchmark
on
the
new
york
mercantile
exchange
on
tuesday
the
highest
seasonally
since
the
rbob

route
vessels
based
on
favorable
spreads
for
crude
oil
and
products
and
right
now
moving
gasoline
to
the
united
states
is
more
profitable
but
this
shipment
also
could
mean
demand
in
saudi
arabia
is
weakening
campbell
said
the
shipment
suggests
that
the
americas
has
become
one
of
the
best
destinations
for
surplus
gasoline
he
added
it
s
tough
because
that
means
asia
really
is
quite
significantly
oversupplied
campbell
said
demand
in
saudi
arabia
has
waned
as
the
government
has
undertaken
reforms
that
have
reduced
fuel
consumption
across
several
sectors
