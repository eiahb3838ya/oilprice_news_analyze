macedo
admitted
tim

could
have
operated
differently
to

taking
a
slew

measures
including
upgrading
outlets
a
new
kids
menu
and
breakfast
it
also
began
testing
deliveries
this

he
said
many
of
these
ideas
came
from
franchisees
he
said
acknowledging
the
company
had
not
communicated
well
with
them
in
the
past
and
that
he
was
trying
to
change
that
by
meeting
disgruntled
franchisees
all
around

association

was
formed
last
year
to
fight
the
company
s
alleged
mismanagement
of
franchise
operations
did
not
immediately
comment
it
has
previously
said
that
rbi
inflated
prices
on
items
franchisees
buy
from
the
corporate
office
a
claim
the
company
and
the
official
franchisee
advisory
board
which
has
largely
distanced
itself
from
the
gwnfa
attribute
to
market
moves
and
to
lack
of
proper
communication
about
the
reasons
public
perception
of
this
brand
has
really
been
tainted
and
tarnished
over
the
last
year
to
months

said
it

going
to
require
