analyzing

energy
inc

superior
wisconsin
refinery
as

of
an
probe
of

said
on
wednesday
the
shrapnel
blown
away
from
the
fluidic
catalytic
cracking
unit
at
the
refinery
tore
through
other
refinery
units
including
a
tank
containing
hot
asphalt
which
poured
out
in
a
wave
of
flame
across
the
refinery
said
kristen
kulinowski
the
board
s
interim
executive
the
risk
of
further
explosions
forced
most
of
superior
s
residents
to
evacuate
for
hours
the
metallurgical
analysis
is
proceeding
slowly
kulinowski
said
it
s
a
painstaking
process
as
much
of
the
metal
is
covered
with
asphalt
she
said
the
superior
refinery

remained
shut
since
the
explosion
like
the

the

no

authority
but
recommends
changes
in
industry
practices
