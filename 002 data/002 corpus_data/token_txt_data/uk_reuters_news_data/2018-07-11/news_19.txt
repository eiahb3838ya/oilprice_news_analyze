noc
said
on
wednesday
four
export
terminals
were
being
reopened
after
eastern
factions
handed
over
the
ports
ending
a
standoff
that
had
shut
down
most
of
libya
s
oil
output
production
and
export
operations
would
be
restored
within
the
next
few
hours
an
noc
statement
said
although
the
restart
at
es
sider
and
ras
lanuf
where
workers
were
evacuated
and
storage
tanks
damaged
in
fighting
last
month
was
expected
to
be
gradual
a
tanker
at
hariga
terminal
started
loading
million
barrels
of
crude
on
wednesday
afternoon
a
port
source
said
eastern
factions
had
effectively
blockaded
exports
from
the
territory
they
control
since
late
june
saying
too
much
oil
revenue
processed
through
tripoli
was
going
to
armed
groups
based
in
western
libya
including
their
rivals
the
disruption
had
threatened
to
keep
offline
as
much
as
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
libyan
oil
from
previous
production
of
a
little
over
million
bpd
it
risked
deepening
a
wedge
between
rival
political
and
military
alliances
based
in
eastern
and
western
libya
since
disputed
elections
four
years
ago
and
raised
the
prospect
of
complicating
efforts
to
end
years
of
turmoil
since
the
country
s
uprising
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
terminals
were
shut
when
armed
opponents
of
commander
khalifa
haftar
attacked
them
on
june
the
assault
was
repelled
a
week
later
but
eastern
officials
aligned
with
haftar
blocked
the
internationally
recognised
noc
in
tripoli
from
the
ports
and
stopped
loadings
at
zueitina
and
hariga
terminals
saying
they
would
take
control
of
exports
through
a
parallel
noc
based
in
the
east
noc
tripoli
said
the
ports
were
restored
to
its
control
on
wednesday
allowing
it
to
lift
force
majeure
a
legal
waiver
on
contractual
obligations
at
all
four
terminals
it
commended
haftar
s
libyan
national
army
for
putting
the
national
interest
first
by
handing
them
back
eastern
oil
facilities
guards
and
the
head
of
the
parallel
noc
faraj
said
confirmed
the
ports
were
reopening
although
said
told
reuters
that
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
which
have
been
damaged
in
repeated
rounds
of
fighting
required
repairs
the
ports
of
zueitina
and
hariga
are
now
open
for
any
tankers
carrying
a
contract
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
need
some
maintenance
he
said
a
reuters
team
that
visited
the
ports
on
tuesday
found
the
area
littered
with
armed
vehicles
destroyed
in
last
month
s
clashes
an
engineer
at
the
harouge
storage
tanks
in
ras
lanuf
said
four
out
of
tanks
were
still
functional
with
about
barrels
ready
for
export
at
es
sider
an
engineer
said
damage
was
limited
to
bullet
holes
and
theft
of
vehicles
and
that
five
storage
tanks
holding
million
barrels
are
in
use
for
exports
over
the
past
two
weeks
eastern
factions
had
come
under
intense
international
pressure
to
end
the
stoppage
diplomatic
sources
said
sources
in
the
east
said
conditions
for
reopening
the
ports
included
ensuring
an
equitable
distribution
of
resources
across
libya
and
welcomed
the
suggestion
late
on
tuesday
by
the
government
in
tripoli
of
a
committee
to
review
central
bank
spending
noc
tripoli
chairman
mustafa
sanalla
said
the
debate
over
fair
distribution
of
oil
revenues
was
at
the
heart
of
the
recent
crisis
the
real
solution
is
transparency
so
i
renew
my
call
on
the
responsible
authorities
the
ministry
of
finance
and
central
bank
to
publish
budgets
and
detailed
public
expenditure
he
said
in
the
noc
statement
but
analysts
say
any
deal
is
likely
to
be
fragile
given
the
slow
progress
so
far
in
unifying
rival
central
banks
in
east
and
west
libya
reforming
spending
and
reducing
the
economic
power
of
armed
groups
libya
s
oil
production
has
fluctuated
widely
since
sending
what
was
one
of
the
wealthiest
economies
in
the
region
into
crisis
the
gap
between
the
official
and
black
market
exchange
rates
has
fuelled
corruption
and
criminal
activity
bloated
state
salaries
and
subsidies
remain
unreformed
a
western
diplomat
described
the
reopening
of
the
ports
as
a
step
in
the
right
direction
but
said
the
actions
durability
depends
on
how
quickly
a
fiscal
reform
package
moves
forward
