stocks
fell
and
metals
prices
slumped
to
their
lowest
in
a
year
on
wednesday
as
threats
of
tariffs
on
an
additional
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
pushed
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
ever
closer
to
a
trade
war
the
detailing
overnight
of
president
donald
trump
s
tariffs
dampened
hopes
that
washington
will
eventually
step
back
from
the
escalating
row
the
clock
now
starts
ticking
on
a
period
of
public
comment
before
the
levies
get
imposed
trump
has
said
he
may
ultimately
target
more
than
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
roughly
the
total
amount
of
imports
from
china
last
year
inevitably
shanghai
markets
were
hardest
hit
with
stocks
there
closing
down
almost
percent
and
the
yuan
weakening
towards
last
week
s
lows
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
lost
more
than
percent
as
did
japan
s
nikkei
as
the
yen
received
something
of
a
safety
bid
europe
s
main
bourses
extended
losses
after
trump
kicked
off
a
nato
summit
in
brussels
by
accusing
germany
of
being
a
captive
of
russia
there
is
still
a
good
six
or
seven
weeks
before
these
tariffs
take
effect
so
it
is
not
like
we
are
going
to
see
these
tomorrow
but
it
is
definitely
the
next
step
in
a
trade
war

global
strategist
james
rossiter
said
i
m
curious
to
see
what
china
does
to
retaliate
in
the
coming
the
concerns
were
also
evident
in
currency
markets
the
australian
dollar
often
seen
as
a
proxy
for
china
s
economic
fortunes
due
to
raw
materials
it
sells
there
fell
percent
south
korea
s
won
and
taiwan
s
dollar
both
dropped
about
percent
while
mexico
s
peso
which
also
faces
the
threat
of
trump
ditching
the
nafta
trade
pact
lost
percent
it
was
industrial
metals
prices
though
that
took
the
heaviest
hit
over
worries
that
the
dispute
could
ultimately
dent
china
s
economy
copper
zinc
and
lead
all
slumped
as
much
as
percent
to
their
lowest
levels
in
about
a
year
copper
was
down
percent
at
nickel
tin
and
aluminum
also
dropped
to
lows
trump
s
latest
move
took
the
wind
out
of
investors
sails
largely
because
the
central
scenario
for
many
in
the
markets
is
that
washington
will
eventually
step
back
from
the
escalating
row
and
settle
for
some
sort
of
compromise
the
more
it
turns
up
the
heat
therefore
the
more
likely
the
tariffs
get
implemented
just
like
the
levies
on
billion
of
chinese
and
imports
triggered
on
friday
there
certainly
is
going
to
be
pronounced
risks
mainly
because
we
ve
now
moved
on
to
the
phase
of
it
mizuho
bank
s
head
of
economics
and
strategy
vishnu
varathan
said
this
is
going
to
drag
on
until
they
can
all
come
to
the
table
and
agree
to
even
the
playing
field
but
the
unpredictability
of
the
situation
continues
to
rattle
the
markets
varathan
said
washington
had
proposed
the
extra
tariffs
after
efforts
to
negotiate
a
solution
to
the
dispute
failed
to
reach
an
agreement
senior
administration
officials
said
on
tuesday
wall
street
s
s
p
had
closed
at
its
highest
level
for
almost
six
months
but
futures
on
the
index
and
the
dow
jones
were
down
percent
respectively
which
pointed
to
a
bumpy
restart
later
morgan
stanley
told
clients
that
the
approaching
earnings
season
could
also
trigger
a
new
wave
of
risk
aversion
if
firms
start
warning
of
slower
earnings
growth
and
the
rising
threat
to
profitability
caused
by
trade
tariffs
the
yen
often
sought
in
times
of
political
tensions
and
market
turmoil
gained
against
a
number
of
peers
the
dollar
pulled
back
from
a
near
peak
of
to
the
euro
fell
percent
to
and
the
australian
dollar
lost
percent
to
china
s
yuan
meanwhile
dropped
percent
against
the
currency
to
per
dollar
and
back
towards
an
low

last

we
are

of
