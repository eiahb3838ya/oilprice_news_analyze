beijing

the
top
chinese
steelmaking
city
of
tangshan
has
ordered
steel
mills
coke
producers
and
utilities
to
cut
output
further
this
summer
according
to
a
document
from
the
city
government
the
latest
step
to
curb
smog
in
one
of
the
country
s
most
polluted
areas
the
move
to
deepen
cuts
in
emissions
will
last
for
six
weeks
from
july
until
according
to
the
document
which
was
reviewed
by
reuters
that
will
be
in
addition
to
percent
capacity
cuts
imposed
from
march
to
november
the
document
did
not
instruct
factories
to
cut
output
by
a
certain
amount
but
told
the
city
s
local
districts
to
set
their
own
detailed
plans
for
curbing
production
by
july
the
curbs
mark
one
of
the
latest
steps
in
beijing
s
war
on
pollution
as
it
pushes
to
clear
the
country
s
notoriously
polluted
skies
sintering
machines
and
blast
furnaces
will
be
major
targets
of
production
cuts
in
the
steel
sector
and
could
be
at
as
much
as
percent
depending
on
emission
levels
at
mills
an
official
at
the
environment
department
of
tangshan
s
government
told
reuters
by
phone
he
declined
to
be
identified
as
he
is
not
authorized
to
talk
to
media
sintering
is
a
process
where
iron
ore
is
heated
into
a
mass
as
a
precursor
to
making
hot
metal
factories
located
outside
the
city
center
that
have
completed
steps
such
as
environmental
upgrades
will
not
need
to
cut
production
by
as
much
as
some
other
sites
according
to
the
document
tangshan
produced
million
tonnes
of
crude
steel
in
accounting
for
percent
of
the
country
s
total
steel
output
analysts
at
industrial
data
provider
smm
expect
the
latest
restrictions
in
tangshan
to
reduce
production
by
up
to
tonnes
of
hot
metal
a
day
production
curbs
will
also
be
imposed
on
other
industries
that
consume
large
amounts
of
power
or
cause
relatively
high
levels
of
emissions
such
as
the
cement
and
glass
sectors
the
government
said
in
the
document
the
city
aims
to
reduce
sulfur
dioxide
emissions
by
percent
nitrogen
dioxide
emissions
by
percent
and
carbon
monoxide
emissions
by
percent
by
the
end
of
august
compared
to
average
emission
levels
