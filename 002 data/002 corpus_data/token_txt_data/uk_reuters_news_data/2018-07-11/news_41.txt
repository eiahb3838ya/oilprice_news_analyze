rosatom
is
in
talks
with
jordan
to
revive
a
deal
to
build
a
nuclear
plant
in
the
kingdom
according
to
the
deputy
ceo
of
the
russian
company
which
is
looking
to
add
another
nuclear
newcomer
nation
to
its
customer
list
the
firm
is
the
clear
leader
in
the
global
nuclear
industry
after
two
of
its
biggest
rivals
areva
and
westinghouse
hit
financial
troubles
and
it
has
a
track
record
of
building
plants
in
countries
without
any
nuclear
tradition
russia
signed
an
intergovernmental
agreement
with
the
middle
eastern
country
in
to
build
a
billion
facility
but
there
has
been
little
progress
since
and
in
recent
weeks
there
have
been
local
media
reports
that
jordanian
authorities
have
scrapped
the
deal
kirill
komarov
deputy
ceo
of
russian
state
nuclear
firm
rosatom
told
reuters
that
talks
were
still
ongoing
to
resolve
technical
and
financing
issues
without
elaborating
the
jordan
deal
was
definitely
not
scrapped
maybe
we
need
some
more
time
with
our
jordanian
colleagues
komarov
said
he
added
jordan
was
a
difficult
place
for
nuclear
as
a
large
part
of
the
country
was
desert
and
a
reactor
needs
lots
of
water
for
cooling
he
said
that
one
of
the
options
being
considered
was
to
build
a
smaller
reactor
than
originally
envisaged
a
small
modular
reactor
rather
than
a
conventional
one
industry
experts
say
the
main
snag
for
the
tender
won
by
rosatom
was
disagreements
between
jordan
and
the
russian
company
over
how
the
project
should
be
financed
a
senior
source
in
the
jordan
atomic
energy
commission
told
reuters
the
original
project
had
been
put
on
hold
and
now
both
parties
were
exploring
the
feasibility
of
constructing
a
small
modular
reactor
eight
years
ago
france
s
areva
was
also
in
the
running
in
jordan
but
it
has
since
had
a
government
bailout
renamed
framatome
it
is
now
part
of
utility
edf
the
other
big
western
reactor
builder
firm
westinghouse
has
been
in
bankruptcy
for
more
than
a
year
limiting
is
ability
to
pursue
foreign
contracts
with
chinese
and
south
korean
vendors
lacking
much
experience
with
building
reactors
abroad
that
has
left
the
field
open
for
rosatom
the
russian
firm
has
an
order
book
worth
billion
and
contracts
to
build
nuclear
reactors
in
nine
countries
over
the
next
decade
including
belarus
bangladesh
china
india
turkey
finland
hungary
egypt
and
iran
framatome
has
one
contract
in
its
order
book
for
a
nuclear
plant
in
hinkley
point
britain
westinghouse
not
a
single
one
the
biggest
challenge
to
rosatom
s
business
could
come
from
china
in
coming
years
according
to
industry
experts
china
has
the
ambition
to
become
a
top
nuclear
vendor
through
its
companies
even
if
it
has
little
experience
in
building
reactors
abroad
with
a
deal
to
fund
edf
s
project
hinkley
point
project
in
britain
and
later
build
its
own
reactors
there
china
has
a
foot
in
the
door
in
a
top
european
energy
market
and
it
has
signed
cooperation
agreements
in
several
countries
without
nuclear
china
has
the
ability
and
the
appetite
to
export
nuclear
said
george
borovas
head
of
nuclear
at
law
firm
shearman
sterling
i
expect
them
to
become
very
competitive
in
the
global
contracts
rosatom
has
won
most
major
global
contracts
over
the
past
decade
in
turkey
a
country
with
huge
energy
needs
rosatom
won
a
billion
contract
eight
years
ago
to
build
own
and
operate
four
reactors
in
akkuyu
on
the
mediterranean
coast
concrete
on
unit
was
poured
in
april
and
komarov
said
rosatom
has
already
invested
billion
but
it
is
still
looking
for
a
partner
to
take
a
stake
of
up
to
percent
komarov
said
rosatom
is
looking
for
a
partner
who
can
bring
financing
but
also
some
industrial
skills
construction
skills
and
an
understanding
of
turkish
energy
markets
he
said
rosatom
has
held
talks
with
several
firms
in
turkey
and
the
middle
east
and
that
rosatom
is
still
targeting
startup
for
the
centenary
of
the
turkish
republic
industry
experts
say
rosatom
s
key
advantage
is
the
range
of
options
it
can
provide
unlike
westinghouse
and
areva
rosatom
has
the
experience
and
financial
clout
to
not
only
sell
reactors
but
also
to
build
the
entire
power
plant
around
it
areva
following
its
bailout
was
split
up
in
fuel
group
orano
and
reactor
builder
framatome
leaving
rosatom
as
the
world
s
only
integrated
nuclear
firm
with
a
shopping
model
from
uranium
enrichment
to
nuclear
waste
handling
rosatom
s
flexibility
to
offer
different
contracting
methods
and
scenarios
to
suit
the
particular
and
financial
capabilities
of
each
country
is
a
very
smart
way
of
approaching
this
industry
