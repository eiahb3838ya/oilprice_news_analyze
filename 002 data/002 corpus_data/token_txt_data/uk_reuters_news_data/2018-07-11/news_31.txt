update 2-opec sees lower 2019 demand for its oil, points to return of surplus
london

opec
on
wednesday
forecast
world
demand
for
its
crude
will
decline
next
year
as
growth
in
consumption
slows
and
rivals
pump
more
pointing
to
the
return
of
an
oil
market
surplus
despite
an
pact
to
restrain
supplies
giving
its
first
forecasts
in
a
monthly
report
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
said
the
world
would
need
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
from
its
members
next
year
down
bpd
from
this
year
the
drop
in
demand
for
opec
crude
means
there
will
be
less
strain
on
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
in
making
up
for
supply
losses
such
as
falling
venezuelan
and
libyan
output
and
an
imminent
drop
in
iranian
exports
as
sanctions
return
following
the
robust
growth
seen
this
year
oil
market
developments
are
expected
to
slightly
moderate
in
with
the
world
economy
and
global
oil
demand
forecasts
to
grow
slightly
less
opec
said
in
the
report
oil
topped
a
barrel
this
year
for
the
first
time
since
boosted
by
output
cuts
and
involuntary
supply
losses
president
donald
trump
has
been
urging
saudi
arabia
and
opec
to
raise
output
to
cool
prices
opec
and
a
group
of
countries
agreed
on
june
to
return
to
percent
compliance
with
oil
output
cuts
that
began
in
january
after
months
of
underproduction
by
venezuela
and
others
pushed
adherence
above
percent
the
strong
pace
of
oil
demand
that
helped
opec
balance
the
market
is
expected
to
wane
next
year
opec
expects
world
oil
demand
to
grow
by
million
bpd
down
from
million
bpd
in
and
said
any
upside
could
be
accommodated
if
the
world
economy
performs
better
than
expected
leading
to
higher
growth
in
crude
oil
demand
opec
will
continue
to
have
sufficient
supply
to
support
oil
market
stability
opec
said
oil
prices
maintained
an
earlier
decline
on
wednesday
after
the
release
of
the
opec
report
trading
around
a
barrel
in
june
opec
oil
output
rose
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
largely
due
to
higher
saudi
production
the
report
said
citing
figures
opec
collects
from
secondary
sources
this
means
compliance
with
the
original
deal
has
slipped
to
percent
according
to
a
reuters
calculation
meaning
members
are
still
cutting
more
than
promised
opec
s
june
output
is
bpd
more
than
opec
expects
the
demand
for
its
oil
to
average
next
year
suggesting
a
small
surplus
in
the
market
should
opec
keep
pumping
the
same
amount
and
other
things
remain
equal
still
a
drop
in
iranian
exports
could
easily
push
the
balance
back
to
deficit
iranian

citing
figures
from
the
state
oil
company
said
oil
exports
would
drop
by
bpd
with
the
restart
of
sanctions
and
the
higher
prices
that
have
followed
the
deal
have
prompted
growth
in
rival
supply
and
a
surge
of
shale
opec
expects
supply
to
expand
by
million
bpd
next
year
far
more
than
the
expansion
in
world
demand
next
year
s
supply
growth
will
be
led
by
the
united
states
with
brazil
and
canada
also
contributing
but
opec
sees
shale
supply
additions
slowing
in
the
second
half
of
and
into
as
bottlenecks
persist
some
of
the
planned
pipeline
capacity
increases
have
been
delayed
and
as
a
result
the
takeaway
capacity
issue
could
remain
a
major
constraint
until
next
winter
