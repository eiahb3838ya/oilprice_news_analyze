the
military
capabilities
of
the
various
parties
and
the
diplomatic
context
of
the
latest
threats
iran
can
not
legally
close
the
waterway
unilaterally
because
part
of
it
is
in
oman
s
territorial
waters
however
ships
pass
through
iranian
waters
which
are
under
the
responsibility
of
iran
s
islamic
revolutionary
guards
navy
in
the
guards
interrogated
and
held
sailors

after
they
entered

territorial
waters
elsewhere
in
the
gulf
a
year
earlier
iran
fired
shots
at
a
tanker
which
it
said
damaged
an
iranian
oil
platform
and
held
a
container
ship

its
crew
for
a
week
over
a
debt

diverting
it
with
patrol
boats
in
the

the

said
in

iran
could
use
its
cruise
and
ballistic
missiles
and
drones
mines
speedboats
and
missile
launchers
in
the
gulf
area
to
confront
the
united
states
in
the
guards
staged
a
drill
shown
on
state
television
in
which
a
replica
of
a
aircraft
carrier
was
destroyed
with
missiles
and
loaded
with
explosives
while
the
guards
practiced
laying
mines
in
the
strait
in
recent
years
there
have
been
periodic
confrontations
between
the
guards
and
military
in
the
gulf
the
navy
has
said
that
from
january
to
august
there
was
an
average
of
unsafe
or
unprofessional
interactions
per
month
between
navy
and
iranian
maritime
forces
including
an
iranian
drone
flying
near
a
navy
warplane
and
iranian
military
boat
sailing
close

tehran
has
accused
forces
of
provocation
their
security
and
the
security
of
their
interests
in
the
region
are
in
our
hands
the
guards
salami
said
this
year
although
the
number
of
incidents
has
dropped
in
recent
months
during
the
war
in
the
two
sides
attacked
ships
in
the
gulf
to
hamper
one
another
s
oil
exports
in
what
was
known
as
the
tanker
war
in
a
frigate
struck
an
iranian
mine
blowing
a
hole
in
its
hull
and
breaking
its
keel
the
office
of
naval
intelligence
oni
said
the
united
states
destroyed
two
iranian
oil
terminals
sank
an
iranian
warship
and
damaged
another
in
response
the
oni
said
the
fifth
fleet
based
in
bahrain
is
tasked
with
protecting
commercial
ships
in
the
area
officials
have
said
closing
the
strait
would
be
crossing
a
red
line
and
have
pledged
to
take
action
to
reopen
it
we
have
the
forces
we
need
to
maintain
free
flow
of
commerce
and
the
freedom
of
navigation
navy
capt
bill
urban
central
command
spokesman
told
reuters
western
navies
also
stage
military
exercises
in
the
gulf
and
arab
states
across
the
gulf
from
iran
particularly
saudi
arabia
and
the
uae
have
naval
capacities
an
oni
report
said
last
year
that
iran
s
guards
naval
doctrine
was
based
on
speed
numbers
stealth
survivability
and
lethality
and
that
it
had
aquired
fast
attack
craft
small
boats
cruise
missiles
and
mines
individually
these
improvements
can
not
compete
with
western
technology
however
taken
together
they
could
create
an
overall
capability
that
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
particularly
when
employed
in
tight
operational
spaces
like
the
persian
gulf
and
strait
of
hormuz
the
oni
said
the
has
said
it
would
use
minesweepers
warship
escorts
and
potentially
air
strikes
to
protect
the
free
flow
of
commerce
but
reopening
the
strait
could
be
a
lengthy
process
especially
if
the
guards
laid
mines
michael
connell
head
of
the
iran
programme
with
research
body
cna
said
of
all
iran
s
capabilities
mines
were
probably
the
one
that
caused
the
most
concern
he
also
said
a
misjudged
incident
which
would
trigger
direct
fire
was
a
more
likely
scenario
than
a
blockade
of
the
strait
i
would
be
less
worried
about
a
bolt
out
of
the
blue
attempt
to
close
the
strait
and
more
worried
about
stumbling
into
a
conflict
he
said
iranian
officials
differ
over
the
significance
of
the
latest
threat
to
close
the
strait
by
calling
on
countries
to
cut
their
oil
exports
from
iran
america
has
already
declared
war
on
iran
a
senior
iranian
official
and
a
former
revolutionary
guards
commander
who
served
during
the
war
with
iraq
told
reuters
if
we
come
to
that
point
of
not
being
able
to
export
any
oil
we
will
surely
close
the
another
official
who
like
the
first
declined
to
be
named
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
matter
placed
the
threat
in
the
context
of
talks
with
world
powers
on
the
future
of
the
nuclear
deal
iran
has
said
it
would
remain
in
the
deal
which
frees
it
from
international
sanctions
in
return
for
curbs
on
its
nuclear
programme
only
if
its
interests
were
guaranteed
the
strait
issue
gives
iran
an
upper
hand
in
the
talks
everyone
should
know
that
iran
can
not
be
pressured
the
second
senior
iranian
government
official
said
iran
has
never
closed
the
waterway
even
under
the
worst
conditions
and
mounted
pressure
