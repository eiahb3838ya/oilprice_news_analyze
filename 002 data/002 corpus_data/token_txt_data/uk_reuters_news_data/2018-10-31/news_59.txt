big oil outspends billionaires in washington state carbon tax fight
reuters
the
oil
industry
has
spent
a
record
million
to
fight
a
ballot
measure
in
washington
state
that
would
create
the
nation
s
first
carbon
tax
double
what
an
alliance
of
green
groups
and
billionaire
activists
has
spent
to
support
it
according
to
state
data
reviewed
by
reuters
the
battle
reflects
the
stakes
of
climate
regulation
the
oil
industry
is
worried
that
new
curbs
on
carbon
emissions
will
hobble
business
while
environmental
advocates
are
concerned
that
a
failure
to
act
soon
to
halt
global
warming
will
spell
devastating
consequences
for
the
planet
washington
is
the
nation
s
fifth
biggest
state
with
five
refineries
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
it
is
also
among
several
states
that
have
vowed
to
pursue
climate
action
in
defiance
of
president
donald
trump
s
agenda
to
ease
regulation
on
fossil
fuel
companies
the
state
s
carbon
emissions
fee
and
revenue
allocation
initiative
known
as
initiative
would
impose
a
fee
on
each
metric
ton
of
carbon
released
to
the
atmosphere
rising
a
year
until
the
state
s
emissions
target
is
met
it
would
generate
billion
over
five
years
for
clean
energy
and
air
programs
if
it
is
passed
by
voters
in
next
week
s
election
according
to
a
state
analysis
the
measure
is
on
the
ballot
for
the
elections
a
poll
this
month
showed
half
of
voters
approve
of
the
initiative
with
percent
against
and
percent
undecided
if
the
measure
passes
the
oil
industry
is
likely
to
feel
the
most
pain
since
transportation
is
the
largest
contributor
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
washington
at
percent
according
to
a
state
report
from
the
western
states
petroleum
association
raised
million
from
oil
companies
and
business
groups
to
oppose
the
measure
the
most
ever
spent
in
the
state
to
defeat
a
ballot
initiative
according
to
state
campaign
finance
data
the
previous
record
was
set
in
when
agriculture
and
food
companies
spent
million
to
defeat
a
measure
to
require
labeling
of
genetically
engineered
foods
the
tax
money
has
fueled
a
public
relations
blitz
involving
television
and
digital
ads
flyers
and
mailers
that
argued
the
fee
would
drive
up
energy
costs
for
consumers
small
businesses
and
farms
and
which
criticized
proposed
exemptions
for
industries
like
aluminum
pulp
and
paper
and
power
plants
the
state
s
largest
polluters
would
be
exempt
from
s
new
costs
so
many
big
corporations
would
pay
nothing
but
families
small
businesses
and
farms
would
pay
billions
in
higher
energy
costs

says
in
one
ad
while
standing
in
a

on
her

one
of
the
most
widely
viewed

dana
bieber
a
spokeswoman
for
the
no
on
campaign
said
the
high
spending
was
justified
we
re
up
against
a
very
misleading
campaign
and
we
think
it
s
important
that
voters
have
the
facts
she
said
in
an
interview
top
donors
to
the
no
on
campaign
include
bp
america
which
contributed
more
than
million
followed
by
phillips
with
million
and
andeavor
with
million
all
three
own
refineries
in
the
state
bp
spokesman
jason
ryan
said
his
company
supports
action
to
combat
climate
change
but
strongly
opposes
the
washington
ballot
initiative
because
it
believes
it
would
disrupt
the
state
s
economy
without
significantly
reducing
carbon
emissions
it
is
a
poorly
designed
policy
he
said
refining
companies
like
valero
energy
corp
and
hollyfrontier
corp
also
contributed
as
did
the
national
refining
industry
lobby
group
the
american
fuel
and
petrochemical
manufacturers
a
sign
the
industry
is
concerned
the
measure
could
inspire
other
states
to
follow
suit
by
contrast
environmental
groups
and
climate

donated
million
the
league
of
conservation
voters
which

million
and
gates
and

who
each
contributed
million
the
campaign
spent
million
of
the
money
on
television
advertising
emphasizing
the
clean
air
benefits
of
a
carbon
tax
along
with
spending
on
canvassing
and
voter
research
with
big
oil
spending
million
that
makes
it
a
real
fight
