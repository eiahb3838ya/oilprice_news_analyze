japan's nuclear industry growing, but slower than government hoped
tokyo

japan
s
resurgent
nuclear
industry
will
miss
a
government
target
of
providing
at
least
a
fifth
of
the
country
s
electricity
by
a
reuters
analysis
shows
with
eight
reactors
running
and
one
more
set
to
come
online
in
november
nuclear
has
this
year
overtaken
renewables
in
power
output
for
the
first
time
since
the
catastrophe
when
all
of
the
country
s
nuclear
plants
were
idled
yet
operators
can
expect
as
few
as
six
units
to
restart
in
the
next
five
years
and
fewer
than
by
the
analysis
shows
that
is
far
short
of
the
needed
to
meet
the
government
target
reiterated
this
year
based
on
the
analysis
the
world
s
economy
may
get
about
percent
of
its
power
from
nuclear
in
compared
with
a
government
target
of
percent
it
s
impossible
to
meet
the
target
that
s
pretty
much
confirmed
said
takeo
kikkawa
an
energy
studies
professor
at
tokyo
university
of
science
who
sat
on
an
official
panel
that
reviewed
japan
s
energy
policy
this
year
he
said
he
did
not
expect
another
round
of
restarts
before
one
major
trading
house
predicts
nuclear
will
account
for
percent
of
power
production
in
according
to
a
presentation
given
at
a
private
seminar
this
year
and
shown
to
reuters
nuclear
remains
an
unpopular
energy
option
in
japan
and
the
country
will
reboot
only
a
fraction
of
the
reactors
it
had
before
the
disaster
six
reactors
at
fukushima
daiichi
are
being
dismantled
in
a
exercise
that
is
fraught
with
technological
challenges
and
radioactive
waste
operators
have
decided
to
decommission
another
units
across
the
country
since
fukushima
the
nuclear
regulation
authority
created
new
safety
standards
from
scratch
after
the
disaster
highlighted
failings
in
the
industry
and
its
overseers
all
reactors
must
be
relicensed
before
restarting
yet
japan
s
nuclear
industry
which
before
fukushima
operated
the
world
s
number
of
reactors
and
provided
about
percent
of
the
country
s
electricity
has
staged
a
significant
recovery
the
turnaround
has
exceeded
expectations
of
analysts
and
the
utilities
themselves
kansai
electric
power
and
kyushu
electric
power
for
instance
have
won
approval
to
restart
or
are
on
course
to
win
approval
for
all
the
reactors
they
applied
to
relicense
those
units
are
far
from
tokyo

are
pressurised

reactors
pwr
unlike
the
boiling
water
reactor
bwr
designs
favoured
in
eastern
japan
including
those
that
melted
down
at
fukushima
many
court
cases
are
pending
for
reactors
in
the
east
of
the
country
local
political
support
varies
and
the
regulator
is
locked
in
disputes
with
operators
over
earthquake
risk
assessment
the
older
bwr
technology
used
in
many
of
the
reactors
under
review
is
also
an
issue
because
the
stigma
of
fukushima
hangs
over
them
when
you
come
to
the
bwrs
the
issue
becomes
very
politicized
said
nobuo
tanaka
the
chairman
of
the
sasakawa
peace
foundation
who
was
the
head
of
the
international
energy
agency
between
and
after
a
stint
in
japan
s
industry
ministry
the
reputation
of
tepco
which
operates
two
nuclear
plants
that
have
been
damaged
in
natural
disasters
also
looms
large
tanaka
said
tepco
does
not
have
any
support
as
a
nuclear
operator
he
said
the
utility
has
to
be
removed
from
the
equation
before
progress
on
bwr
reactors
can
be
made
he
said
tepco
has
reached
the
first
stage
of
approval
but
faces
strong
opposition
from
local
residents
but
japan
s
utility
lobby
group
said
progress
was
being
made
the
safety
reviews
of
pwr
plants
took
time
but
they
have
been
progressing
steadily
and
there
have
been
some
developments
in
the
bwr
category
as
well
satoru
katsuno
the
chairman
of
japan
s
federation
of
electric
utilities
and
president
of
chubu
electric
said
of
the
outlook
for
restart
approvals
chubu
electric
has
been
locked
in
a
dispute
for
years
with
the
regulator
over
disaster
resilience
measures
at
its
hamaoka
plant
which
uses
bwr
reactors
for

the
analysis
suggests
that
japan
will
rely
on
fossil
fuels
particularly
liquefied
natural
gas
and
coal
as
the
pace
of
renewables
expansion
slows
that
will
make
it
harder
to
meet
its
emissions
targets
under
international
agreement
the
government
estimates
costs
for
replacement
fuel
mostly
liquefied
natural
gas
to
compensate
for
idled
reactors
totalled
trillion
yen
billion
across
the
industry
in
the
six
years
through
march
the
lack
of
realistic
energy
targets
makes
it
harder
for
the
industry
to
plan
for
investment
utility
officials
say
and
the
issue
of
disaster
resilience
is
not
going
away
a
big
earthquake
struck
the
northern
island
of
hokkaido
in
september
and
