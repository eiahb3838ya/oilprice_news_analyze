for
an

which
relies
on
vast
oil
wealth
as
its
most
important
source
of
income
is
seeking
to
increase
crude
production
capacity
to
million

by
from
million
bdp
now

is
trying
to
recover
from
years
of
violence
including
a
war
with
islamic
state
militants
that

we
will
do
our
best
to
stabilize
the

after
officially
taking

the

at
the
moment
is
at
a
fair
price
he
said
in
response
to
a
question
about
an
upcoming
opec
meeting
in
december
it
s
not
too
high
it
s
not
dollars
per
barrel
and
it
s
not
we
will
look
after
our
country
as
a
first
priority
but
will
not
put
aside
the
interests
of
the
the
international
energy
agency
estimates
the
maximum
that
iraq
can
sustainably
pump
is
million
bpd
leaving
little
room
to
increase
output
significantly
in
the
short
term
the
majority
of
its
crude
exports
go
to
asia
ghadhban
nominated
by
prime
minister
adel
abdul
mahdi
and
confirmed
as
minister
in
a
parliamentary
vote
last
week
said
he
would
look
at
ways
to
reform
the
oil
ministry
including
by
eliminating
nepotism
ghadhban
said
he
would
seek
to
develop
oil
refineries
by
increasing
their
production
capacity
and
reducing
gas
flaring
iraq
has
continued
to
flare
some
of
the
gas
extracted
alongside
oil
at
its
fields
because
it
lacks
the
facilities
to
process
it
into
fuel
iraq
has
said
it
hopes
to
end
gas
flaring
by
immediate
challenges
for
ghadhban
and
the
rest
of
iraq
s
new
government
will
include
how
to
contend
with
imminent
sanctions
on
iraqi
neighbor
iran
ghadhban
said
that
iraq
would
prioritize
its
own
national
interests
and
review
current
exports
of
oil
to
iran
which
are
estimated
at
less
than
barrels
a
day
he
said
this
was
a
minor
issue
given
the
amount
on
the
subject
of
resuming
oil
exports
through
kurdish
areas
of
northern
iraq
he
said
we
don
t
have
any
previous
issues
with
the
region
we
will
work
to
overcome
all
exports
from
kirkuk
s
oilfields
were
halted
after
an
iraqi
military
offensive
to
retake
the
disputed
territories
which
had
come
under
kurdish
control
in
following
a
failed
kurdish
independence
referendum
opposed
by
baghdad
the
bulk
of
iraq
s
oil
is
exported
via
its
southern
terminals
which
account
for
more
than
percent
of
the
opec
producer
s
state
revenue
iraq
s
southern
oil
exports
averaged
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
october
two
oil
executives
told
reuters
on
wednesday
exports
were
down
from
the
september
average
of
million
bpd
owing
to
bad
weather
which
slowed
shipments
on
some
days
