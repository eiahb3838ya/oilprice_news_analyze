norway
s
billion
wealth
fund
the
world
s
largest
wants
to
know
how
much
of
a
company
s
carbon
dioxide
emission
costs
can
be
passed
on
to
customers
the
fund
holds
percent
of
all
globally
listed
shares
representing
companies
so
a
lot
is
at
stake
for
the
fund
as
it
considers
how
to
allocate
investments
amid
rising
costs
norges
bank
investment
management
is
turning
to
data
analytics
building
a
software
tool
that
can
help
guide
the
process
called
angle
the
software
can
now
take
data
such
as
carbon
dioxide
emissions
combine
it
with
trading
data
and
earnings
data
of
a
given
company
and
see
how
it
will
affect
its
earnings
in
the
years
ahead
the
next
step
which
has
not
been
disclosed
before
is
to
develop
the
platform
to
see
how
much
of
the
carbon
cost
can
be
passed
on
to
customers
and
how
much
companies
must
pay
themselves
for
us
it
is
reasonably
obvious
that
the
focus
on
climate
change
risk
will
not
go
away
and
that
is
there
as
a
risk
for
the
companies
we
invest
in
whether
directly
or
indirectly
fund
ceo
yngve
slyngstad
said
in
an
interview
therefore
there
is
an
issue
about
the
pricing
of
different
companies
he
told
reuters
adding
that
the
latest
development
of
the
software
was
not
yet
completed
there
is
more
work
to
be
done
on
it
he
said
the
work
began
when
the
fund
was
mandated
by
the
norwegian
parliament
to
divest
from
companies
that
derive
percent
of
more
of
its
business
or
activities
from
thermal
coal
in
we
needed
the
data
to
analyse
utilities
energy
mix
but
it
has
developed
to
see
if
it
can
be
used
to
other
sectors
said
slyngstad
other
institutional
investors
are
also
pushing
companies
to
disclose
the
data
they
need
to
assess
the
risk
to
their
investments
the
norwegian
sovereign
wealth
fund
is
one
of
the
leading
institutional
investors
when
it
comes
to
the
analysis
of
climate
risk
stephanie
pfeifer
chief
executive
of
the
institutional
investors
group
on
climate
change
a
group
of
pension
funds
and
asset
managers
representing
over
trillion
euros
trillion
in
assets
they
have
put
resources
in
the
research
that
others
have
not
necessarily
done
they
have
had
the
capacity
to
do
so
she
told
reuters
still
while
disclosing
data
is
becoming
more
mainstream
few
companies
disclose
the
financial
impact
on
their
businesses
a
survey
by
a
task
force
showed
in
september
for
slyngstad
the
key
is
to
get
hold
of
data
once
you
get
hold
of
good
data
he
said
you
can
go
from
words
to
action
the
only
surprise
with
this
work
is
how
hard
it
is
to
get
the
data
said
slyngstad
i
think
it
will
take
years
to
get
good
data
from
the
majority
of
companies
we
are
invested
euros
