stock
markets
surge
on

bringing
some
relief
to
jittery
investors
after
a
brutal
october
that
saw
equities
suffer
one
of
their
worst
drops
since
the
financial
crisis
ten
years
ago
strong
earnings
reports
in
the
and
europe
spurred
a
broad
rally
despite
data
showing
that
china
s
factory
growth
slowed
to
its
lowest
in
two
years
investors
rushed
into

worst
month
since
the
index
has
dropped
percent
from
highs
hit
in
january
still
despite
the
broad
rally
investors
remained
cautious
ultimately
i
m
still
of
the
belief
that
we
are
in
for
more
downside
and
rallies
are
for
selling
but
squeezes
in
bear
markets
are
not
normally
comfortable
affairs
said
neil
campling
of
the
global
thematic
group
at
mirabaud
securities
i
think

day
battle

to
the
bigger
picture

growth
figures
have
been
disappointing
and
the
bank
of
japan
is
striking
a
dovish
stance
at
a

today

there
is
more

for
the

gain
from
current
levels
