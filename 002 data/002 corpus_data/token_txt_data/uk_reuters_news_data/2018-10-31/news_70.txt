china
s
market

will
set
up
a
system
to
recall
vehicles
that
violate
the
country
s
pollution
and
emissions
standards
it
said
on
wednesday
with
cars
now
the
biggest
source
of
smog
in
major
cities
china
s
air
quality
is
going
to
come
under
even
further
pressure
with
another
million
vehicles
set
to
ply
its
roads
in
the
coming
five
years
the
state
administration
for
market
regulation
said
in
comments
posted
on
its
website
the
nation
s
newly
revised
air
pollution
law
includes
provisions
to
recall
vehicles
that
fail
to
meet
state
emissions
standards
it
said
and
it
has
already
studied
similar
product
recall
systems
in
the
united
states
europe
and
japan
the
regulator
is
currently
studying
key
issues
like
the
identification
of
equipment
defects
and
the
quality
of
key
components
used
in
reducing
engine
emissions
but
it
will
work
with
the
environment
ministry
to
draw
up
new
legislation
and
aims
to
implement
the
new
system
as
soon
as
possible
though
china
has
been
cracking
down
on
factory
emissions
and
curbing
the
consumption
of
coal
vehicle
pollution
remains
a
growing
problem
increasing
ozone
levels
in
many
major
cities
china
s
total
vehicle
fleet
reached
million
last
year
and
cars
were
responsible
for
about
percent
of
air
pollution
in
the
capital
beijing
and
nearly
percent
in
shanghai
according
to
figures
from
the
ministry
of
ecology
and
environment
earlier
this
year
china
eliminated
more
than
million
old
and
substandard
vehicles
from
its
roads
last
year
to
cut
pollution
and
it
has
also
banned
the
sale
of
diesel
its
china
vi
fuel
standards
which
are
tougher
than
those
used
in
the
european
union
have
already
been
introduced
in
the
region
known
for
its
heavy
smog
and
will
be
made
mandatory
nationwide
at
the
beginning
of
next
year
top
refiner
sinopec
is
upgrading
its
refineries
to
produce
fuel
to
comply
with
the
new
standards
but
enforcing
the
standards
has
been
a
challenge
with
fraudulent
practices
believed
to
be
widespread
some
garages
have
been
found
selling
equipment
to
cheat
fuel
quality
detectors
and
the
environment
ministry
said
in
july
it
had
shut
as
many
as
substandard
vehicle
testing
stations
last
year
the
ministry
also
fined
two
truck
makers
late
last
year
for
manufacturing
and
selling
vehicles
that
failed
to
meet
environmental
standards
