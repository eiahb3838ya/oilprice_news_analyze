syrian
refugee
umm
mohammed
fidgeted
in
her
chair
in
a
breezy
office
in
dhlail
city
northern
jordan
before
joking
we
don
t
know
how
to
sit
along
with
others
who
fled
conflict
in
neighbouring
syria
she
works
with
jordanians
in
this
industrial
town
famed
for
its
dairy
and
textile
factories
but
their
work
is
different
retrofitting
homes
to
make
them
green
we
want
to
work
we
don
t
want
to
sit
around
idly
we
want
to
contribute
she
said
of
her
fellow
refugees
motivation
umm
mohammed
she
uses
the
moniker
which
means
mother
of
mohammed
to
avoid
potential
difficulties
with
syrian
officials
is
from
deraa
a
city
close
to
the
jordanian
border
it
was
the
scene
in
march
of
the
first
major
peaceful
protests
against
syrian
president
bashar
umm
mohammed
arrived
in
jordan
later
that
year
with
her
husband
and
four
children
carrying
just
a
few
pieces
of
luggage
at
first
she
worked
from
home
fermenting
pickles
and
making
soap
to
sell
in
the
local
market
but
she
soon
became
involved
with
a
local
women
s
project
to
straw
shading
devices
that
are
fitted
to
windows
to
keep
homes
cooler
her
work
forms
part
of
a
bigger
effort
a
pilot
project
to
retrofit
and
build
affordable
green
homes
led
by
two
organisations
the
jordan
green
building
council
jogbc
and
habitat
for
humanity
the
project
involves
retrofitting
existing
homes
by
adding
shading
devices
water
heaters
and
rainwater
collection
tanks
and
building
new
homes
using
green
techniques
such
as
reflective
paint
and
brick
walls
for
better
insulation
so
far
about
homes
have
been
retrofitted
while
another
or
so
have
been
built
from
scratch
and
have
carbon
emissions
the
jogbc
is
hopeful
that
the
project
which
cuts
emissions
and
builds
community
cohesion
will
spread
to
other
parts
of
the
country
making
the
straw
shades
suits
women
who
do
not
want
to
work
in
factories
with
men
or
who
need
to
work
from
home
due
to
childcare
umm
mohammed
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
and
doing
so
has
also
allowed
her
to
socialise
with
her
jordanian
neighbours
this
project
has
definitely
helped
community
cohesion
in
this
area
umm
mohammed
said
some
of
us
syrians
and
jordanians
are
like
brothers
and
sisters
we
don
t
see
any
difference
the
jordanians
are
very
generous
and
supportive
but
in
other
areas
sometimes
they
shout
at
our
kids
why
are
you
still
here
go
back
to
so
it
jordan
hosts
about
registered
syrian
refugees
according
to
the
united
nations
refugee
agency
unhcr
with
most
living
in
urban
areas
ali
hossein
who
fled
the
fighting
in
his
syrian
hometown
of
ghouta
in
is
one
of
them
in
his
trousers
and
work
boots
he
works
as
a
blacksmith
on
the
green
homes
project
in
dhlail
it
s
a
new
and
interesting
idea
there
s
nothing
like
it
yet
he
said
of
the
building
skills
he
has
acquired
from
to
roof
insulation
techniques
it
was
very
beneficial
and
provided
work
opportunities
for
lots
of
families
and
it
really
helped
us
integrate
he
said
syria
s
bloody
conflict
now
entering
its
eighth
year
has
caused
half
a
million
deaths
and
drawn
in
world
and
regional
powers
more
than
half
of
its
population
have
fled
their
homes
about
million
sought
refuge
abroad
while
millions
more
have
been
displaced
internally
the
influx
of
syrian
refugees
came
as
jordan
already
hosts
nearly
million
palestinian
refugees
according
to
figures
from
the
relief
and
works
agency
the
additional
refugees
from
syria
have
put
a
strain
on
energy
water
and
housing
demands
and
added
pressure
to
jordan
s
ability
to
meet
its
obligations
under
the
paris
climate
agreement
said
jordan
s
environment
minister
nayef
hmeidi
although
difficult
to
measure
the
environmental
impact
of
the
swell
in
population
was
a
big
challenge
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
all
of
a
sudden
whatever
plans
we
had
whatever
targets
we
had
they
had
to
be
revisited
he
said
in
amman
the
jordanian
capital
amman
is
one
of
more
than
cities
worldwide
that
have
pledged
to
become
by
that
means
they
will
eliminate
nearly
all
fossil
fuel
emissions
and
offset
what
they
can
not
through
actions
such
as
planting
trees
and
even
though
jordan
is
not
a
major
emitter
of
greenhouse
gases
said
more
people
inevitably
means
more
carbon
emissions
sometimes
there
are
things
that
will
slow
us
down
but
they
will
never
stop
us
he
said
for
many
jordanians
the
attention
and
funds
directed
towards
refugees
from
syria
are
a
source
of
tension
some
people
ask
why
are
all
the
grants
going
to
syrians
said
jogbc
project
coordinator
aya
rabab
ah
many
conflicts
started
so
we
worked
for
the
development
of
the
host
community
with
the
engagement
of
the
syrians
so
in
this
way
we
re
reducing
the
conflicts
and
trying
to
create
more
for
jordanian
ibtisam
the
green
homes
project
has
healed
community
rifts
and
helped
the
climate
we
made
friendships
and
became
a
community
through
the
work
said
some
of
us
have
intermarried
we
work
together
relations
are
becoming
better
as
we
mix
and
more
cohesion
is
rabab
ah
said
solving
the
dual
issues
of
housing
and
community
cohesion
meant
the
green
homes
were
both
lowering
emissions
and
as
word
spread
becoming
more
popular
there
are
now
waiting
lists
in
several
parts
of
jordan
with
families
keen
to
lower
their
costs
and
emissions
and
with
builders
looking
to
market
their
green
credentials
amman
s
chief
resilience
officer
nisreen
a
city
official
who
works
across
local
government
departments
and
the
mayor
s
office
said
more
refugees
meant
more
pressure
on
the
capital
s
aging
infrastructure
but
she
said
having
jordanians
and
syrians
work
together
could
bring
opportunities
provided
people
s
mindsets
changed
the
children
who
are
living
today
of
those
refugees
it
s
very
possible
that
they
are
the
jordanians
of
tomorrow
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
meantime
many
syrian
refugees
dream
of
going
home
including
umm
mohammed
however
that
is
not
possible
in
august
the
unhcr
said
conditions
were
not
yet
ready
for
mass
refugee
returns
to
syria
in
the
meantime
we
are
becoming
jordanian
said
umm
mohammed
there
nothing
left
for
us
back
at
home
she
said
they
taken
our
land
our
homes
and
most
of
my
relatives
are
dead
