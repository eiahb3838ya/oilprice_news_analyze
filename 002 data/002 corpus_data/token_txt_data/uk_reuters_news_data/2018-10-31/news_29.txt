london
reuters
opec
has
boosted
oil
production
in
october
to
the
highest
since
a
reuters
survey
found
as
higher
output
led
by
the
united
arab
emirates
and
libya
more
than
offset
a
cut
in
iranian
shipments
due
to
sanctions
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
has
pumped
million
barrels
per
day
this
month
the
survey
on
wednesday
found
up
bpd
from
september
and
the
highest
by
opec
as
a
group
since
december
opec
agreed
in
june
to
pump
more
oil
after
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
curb
rising
prices
and
make
up
for
an
expected
shortfall
in
iranian
exports
oil
hit
a
high
of
a
barrel
on
but
has
since
eased
to
as
concerns
over
tight
supplies
faded
oil
producers
appear
to
be
successfully
offsetting
the
supply
outages
from
iran
and
venezuela
said
carsten
fritsch
analyst
at
commerzbank
in
frankfurt
the
june
pact
involved
opec
russia
and
other
returning
to
percent
compliance
with
output
cuts
that
began
in
january
after
months
of
underproduction
in
venezuela
angola
and
elsewhere
had
pushed
adherence
above
percent
in
october
the
opec
members
bound
by
the
agreement
lowered
compliance
to
percent
as
production
rose
from
a
revised
percent
in
september
the
survey
found
this
is
the
closest
opec
has
moved
to
percent
compliance
since
the
june
agreement
the
biggest
increase
has
come
this
month
from
the
uae
output
in
october
rose
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
the
survey
found
and
could
in
theory
rise
further
as
the
uae
says
its
capacity
will
reach
million
bpd
by
the
the
came
from
libya
where
production
averaged
million
bpd
the
survey
found
a
rise
of
bpd
libyan
output
remains
volatile
due
to
unrest
raising
questions
about
the
stability
of
current
opec
production
saudi
arabia
after
opening
the
taps
in
june
and
then
scaling
back
its
plans
to
pump
more
supplied
million
bpd
in
october
more
than
in
june
and
close
to
a
record
high
the
survey
found
the
kingdom
opec
s
top
producer
has
indicated
it
is
concerned
about
potential
oversupply
raising
the
prospect
that
its
next
production
adjustment
could
be
to
rein
in
output
opec
s
producer
iraq
also
raised
output
in
october
iraqi
supply
could
rise
further
if
iraq
s
new
government
goes
ahead
with
a
deal
reached
by
the
outgoing
administration
and
the
kurdistan
regional
government
krg
to
resume
exporting
kirkuk
crude
to
turkey
via
the
krg
angola
where
natural
declines
at
oilfields
curbed
production
in
recent
years
boosted
supply
in
october
due
to
supply
from
a
new
field
gindungo
output
is
still
far
below
its
opec
target
supply
in
nigeria
rose
by
bpd
like
libya
nigeria
is
not
part
of
the
opec
pact
because
it
often
faces
unplanned
outages
stemming
from
unrest
output
in
kuwait
edged
lower
the
survey
found
the
country
had
raised
production
in
july
following
the
opec
deal
and
kept
it
steady
in
august
and
september
among
countries
with
lower
output
the
biggest
drop
bpd
occurred
in
iran
exports
fell
as
returning
sanctions
discouraged
companies
from
buying
the
country
s
oil
although
the
decline
was
lower
than
some
analysts
expected
iran
is
going
to
come
in
above
expectations
said
an
industry
source
who
tracks
opec
output
referring
to
iranian
supply
in
october
production
also
slipped
further
in
venezuela
where
a
lack
of
funds
for
the
oil
industry
because
of
the
country
s
economic
crisis
is
cutting
refinery
operations
and
crude
exports
despite
these
decreases
opec
output
in
october
has
risen
to
the
highest
since
december
the
month
before
the
pact
took
effect
according
to
reuters
surveys
some
of
the
extra
oil
has
come
from
congo
republic
and
equatorial
guinea
which
joined
opec
in
and
respectively
before
congo
joined
opec
had
an
implied
production
target
for
of
million
bpd
based
on
cutbacks
detailed
in
late
and
nigeria
and
libya
s
expectations
of
output
according
to
the
survey
opec
excluding
congo
pumped
about
bpd
above
this
implied
target
in
october
the
survey
aims
to
track
supply
to
the
market
