canada
s
economy
grew
for
a
seventh
month
in
a
row
in
august
its
longest
stretch
of
expansion
for
more
than
a
year
but
analysts
said
the
bank
of
canada
was
under
little
pressure
to
raise
interest
rates
again
next
month
statistics
canada
said
on
wednesday
that
gdp
in
august
edged
up
by
percent
analysts
in
a
reuters
poll
had
predicted
no
change
from
july
the
last
time
the
country
enjoyed
such
a
long
unbroken
streak
of
growth
was
during
the
nine
months
from
november
to
july
if
gdp
is
flat
in
september
annualized
growth
should
be
about
percent
matching
the
central
bank
s
latest
forecast
the
central
bank
which
last
week
raised
rates
for
a
fifth
time
since
july
reiterated
tuesday
that
more
hikes
would
be
needed
to
handle
an
economy
operating
near
full
capacity
with
jobless
levels
hovering
around
lows
the
bank
is
due
to
announce
rate
decisions
in
both
december
and
january
so
as
long
we
keep
getting
growth
around
that
percent
rate
it
still
means
the
bank
of
canada
is
probably
going
to
continue
hiking
interest
rates
gradually
said
nathan
janzen
senior
economist
at
royal
bank
of
canada
market
expectations
of
an
interest
rate
hike
on
dec
as
reflected
in
the
overnight
index
swaps
market
dipped
slightly
to
percent
from
percent
in
a
reuters
poll
released
on
wednesday
analysts
forecast
that
the
bank
of
canada
would
raise
interest
rates
three
times
next
year
but
would
do
nothing
in
december
statscan
said
the
oil
and
gas
extraction
increased
by
percent
in
august
as
total
crude
output
in
the
province
of
alberta
hit
a
record
high
the
finance
and
insurance
sector
posted
a
percent
gain
the
manufacturing
sector
contracted
percent
in
part
because
of
a
percent
drop
in
motor
vehicle
assembly
after
atypical
shutdowns
at
some
auto
plants
overall
of
the
industrial
sectors
posted
declines
rates
will
eventually
need
to
rise
all
in
good
time
of
course
no
urgency
is
required
on
that
front
as
this
growth
report
suggests
said
doug
porter
chief
economist
at
bmo
financial
group
separately
statscan
said
canadian
producer
prices
edged
up
percent
in
september
from
august
on
higher
prices
for
chemicals
and
energy
and
petroleum
products
analysts
had
predicted
no
change
raw

prices
fell
