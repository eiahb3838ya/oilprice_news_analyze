the

of

took
part
in
the

doubled
according

earlier
this
year
more
coffee
specialists
were
called
on
to
help
improve
the
quality
of
the
beans
to
eventually
help
farmers
attract
higher
prices
from
international
buyers
to
achieve
the
best
prices
farmers
also
formed
collectives
for
selling
their
coffee
to
local
buyers
ramasubramanian
told
the
thomson

the
power
project

the
plan
is
for
the
new
coffee
facilities
to
be
developed
step
by
step
to
be
mostly
operated
by
local
people
and
prioritize
the
employment
