oil
product
margins
have
been
tossed
around
on
a
wild
rollercoaster
ride
in
october
as
factors
like
impending
iran
sanctions
the
trade
war
and
upcoming
new
shipping
regulations
yank
fuel
profits
up
down
and
back
again
some
margins
known
as
cracks
including
for
asian
fuel
oil
and
gasoil
have
boomed
while
others
like
asian
and
european
gasoline
cracks
have
plunged
asia
s
cracks
for
gasoil
and
fuel
oil
have
gained
percent
and
a
whopping
percent
respectively
since
the
start
of
the
year
with
most
of
the
jump
happening
this
month
these
cracks
are
extraordinary
said
sukrit
vijayakar
director
of
indian
energy
consultancy
trifecta
vijayakar
a
veteran
of
india
s
refining
industry
said
such
high
gasoil
and
fuel
oil
cracks
should
move
a
refiner
to
maximise
these
products
keenly
aware
that
these
cracks
are
extraordinary
he
the
refiner
should
protect
such
production
decisions
by
hedging
the
cracks
as
an
insurance
to
protect
windfall
gains
vijayakar
said
the
margin
on
fuel
oil
a
residue
from
crude
processing
is
typically
negative
in
the
last
week
of
october
however
it
stood
at
around
per
barrel
pushed
up
in
part
by
tightening
supply
ahead
of
sanctions
against
iran
a
major
supplier
of
fueloil
which
the
united
states
will
impose
from
next
week
another
strong
performer
has
been
distillate
fuel
including
gasoil
one
of
the
biggest
drivers
here
has
been
new
regulation
by
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
this
will
force
shippers
to
adopt
cleaner
fuel
standards
from
and
it
pushing
up
demand
for
gasoil
made
from
heavy
crude
in
an
imo
world
we
expect
distillate
margins
will
increase

said
on
wednesday
in
a
note
to
clients
we
expect
refiners
with
access
to
heavy
crude
barrels
and
yields
to
benefit
most
from
the
not
all
has
been
rosy
in
refining
this
year
has
been
particularly
painful
for
refiners
specialised
in
churning
out
gasoline
booming
auto
sales
in
emerging
markets
and
especially
china
which
sells
more
than
million
new
cars
every
month
but
also
healthy
demand
from
the
united
states
have
in
the
past
made
gasoline
a
favourite
among
refiners
many
of
whom
maximised
its
yield
that
boom
has
turned
into
a
bust
as
refiners
now
pump
more
than
even
this
growing
market
can
absorb
eroding
profit
margins
european
refiners
sent
their
excess
fuel
to
asia
hoping
to
find
a
home
there
for
their
surplus
petrol
this
came
just
as
china
s
massive
refinery
sector
started
exporting
excess
gasoline
as
even
its
thirsty
domestic
market
couldn
t
cope
with
the
flood
of
fuel
analysts
say
things
may
get
worse
especially
if
an
economic
slowdown
on
the
back
of
widespread
emerging
market
currency
weakness
and
the
trade
war
sucks
demand
out
from
under
a
sector
already
swamped
by
glut
gasoline
fundamentals
continue
to
deteriorate
and
are
a
source
of
concern
for
us
