its

billion
euros

hoekstra
said
we
want
financial
markets
to
take
an
important
role
in
financing
green
projects
but
until
now
dutch
pension
funds
insurers
and
banks
had
to
look
abroad
for
safe
green
government
so
far
france
belgium
and
ireland
are
the
only
euro
zone
countries
to
have
issued
government
bonds
with
the
specific
aim
of
financing
environmentally
friendly
projects
though
green
bonds
make
up
just
a
small
fraction
of
the
overall
bond
market
they
are
attracting
more
attention
because
meeting
targets
will
require
trillions
of
dollars
of
capital
from
public
and
private
sectors
global
green
bond
issuance
hit
a
record

could
reach
