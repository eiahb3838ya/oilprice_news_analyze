reuters
canadian
oil
producer
cenovus
energy
inc
is
considering
further
expansion
of
its
agreements
to
move
crude
by
rail
on
canada
s
two
major
railways
its
chief
executive
said
on
wednesday
last
month
cenovus
signed
deals
with
canadian
national
railway
co
and
canadian
pacific
railway
ltd
to
transport
roughly
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
from
northern
alberta
to
the
gulf
coast
starting
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
agreements
come
as
discounts
on
canadian
oil
to
crude
grew
to
record
highs
this
month
due
to
rising
production
bumping
against
pipeline
constraints
cenovus
could
expand
those
agreements
by
a
further
bpd
for
a
total
volume
of
bpd
and
the
equivalent
of
two
unit
trains
ceo
alex
pourbaix
said
in
an
interview
at
the
reuters
global
commodities
summit
unit
trains
carry
a
single
commodity
we
re
quite
confident
that
if
it
makes
sense
to
ramp
up
to
that
we
ll
be
able
to
have
arrangements
in
place
to
achieve
that
pourbaix
said
we
re
going
to
wait
a
little
while
i
want
to
see
how
the
rest
of
rail
movement
is
ramping
the
calgary
company
which
operates
a
rail
loading
terminal
in
northern
alberta
currently
moves
less
than
bpd
of
its
own
oil
by
rail
with
the
entire
canadian
industry
shipping
about
a
record
high
pourbaix
said
total
shipments
look
to
reach
bpd
by
and
bpd
by
end
of
the
company
said
cenovus
said
earlier
on
wednesday
that
it
was
limiting
output
due
to
severe
discounts
and
said
it
expected
the
price
of
domestic
heavy
crude
to
rise
by
as
increased
rail
volumes
ease
transport
bottlenecks
the
company
did
not
specify
how
much
production
it
was
restricting
but
said
it
has
slowed
output
at
both
its
foster
creek
and
christina
lake
sites
pourbaix
said
the
entire
industry
needed
to
do
its
part
to
reduce
excess
supply
we
re
not
going
to
carry
the
industry
on
our
backs
we
re
going
to
do
this
as
long
as
we
can
justify
that
we
re
creating
value
for
our
shareholders
by
deferring
this
production
pourbaix
told
analysts
pourbaix
said
there
has
been
no
effort
among
producers
to
coordinate
reductions
cenovus
faced
investor
ire
following
its
deal
to
buy
some
of
conocophillips
oil
sands
assets
last
year
and
took
on
a
huge
debt
the
company
has
been
since
taking
steps
to
turn
around
its
business
through
layoffs
and
asset
sales
rival
husky
energy
inc
has
made
a
hostile
bid
for
meg
energy
corp
while
other
canadian
producers
are
expanding
production
pourbaix
said
he
is
not
worried
about
losing
market
share
and
that
his
focus
remains
on
cutting
debt
and
later
growth
through
its
own
projects
alberta
premier
rachel
notley
recently
suggested
that
ottawa
buy
rail
cars
or
locomotives
to
ease
the
backlog
pourbaix
said
while
he
supports
government
help
the
bottlenecks
require
quick
solutions
but
will
ease
late
next
year

production
