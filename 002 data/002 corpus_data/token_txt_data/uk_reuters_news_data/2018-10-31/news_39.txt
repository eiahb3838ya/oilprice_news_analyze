low returns put lid on new british gas storage sites, operators say
london
reuters
investment
in
new
large
gas
storage
sites
in
britain
which
can
help
provide
a
buffer
in
times
of
high
demand
and
reduced
supply
is
seen
by
operators
as
unlikely
due
to
market
prices
offering
low
returns
this
is
due
to
weak
gas
price
spreads
the
difference
between
gas
prices
in
summer
and
winter
which
are
not
allowing
operators
to
cover
their
fixed
costs
the
spread
has
narrowed
in
recent
years
making
it
less
profitable
to
buy
gas
in
the
warmer
months
store
it
and
sell
when
temperatures
fall
and
prices
rise
if
we
were
to
see
any
new
gas
storage
it
will
be
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
saw
any
more
seasonal
gas
storage
roddy
monroe
chair
of
the
gas
storage
operators
group
and
former
head
of
regulatory
affairs
at
centrica
storage
told
the
britain
s
business
energy
and
industrial
strategy
parliamentary
committee
on
wednesday
centrica
closed
britain
s
largest
gas
storage
facility
last
year
as
it
had
become
too
costly
to
maintain
the
ageing
rough
offshore
site
leaving
the
country
with
storage
capacity
equivalent
to
four
to
five
days
of
winter
demand
this
was
down
from
days
previously
and
in
march
this
year
a
cold
snap
triggered
a
warning
of
shortages
driving
a
spike
in
wholesale
gas
prices
to
their
highest
in
at
least
a
decade
gas
storage
is
used
as
a
buffer
at
times
of
high
demand
and
disrupted
supply
which
can
result
from
infrastructure
outages
since
a
government
assessment
in
suggesting
britain
would
need
to
double
its
existing
gas
storage
capacity
it
has
halved
and
although
the
gas
industry
called
for
a
review
of
britain
s
storage
capacity
the
government
declined
saying
market
forces
would
ensure
there
is
enough
gas
duncan
burt
director
of
operations
at
national
grid
said
there
are
different
sources
of
gas
which
can
be
brought
into
britain
to
provide
flexibility
under
severe
events
like
this
march
that
system
has
worked
to
deliver
gas
into
the
storage
whether
it
is
additional
gas
stored
on
a
boat
liquefied
natural
gas
or
whether
through
a
pipeline
we
can
not
see
the
need
for
specific
additional
storage
he
told
the
committee
since
existing
capacity
has
been
either
mothballed
where
investment
is
required
or
closed
like
rough
which
was
britain
s
only
storage
site
other
sites
are
which
have
much
shorter
injection
and
withdrawal
times
and
hold
much
less
gas
to
upgrade
rough
would
have
cost
less
than
billion
pounds
billion
but
the
seasonal
gas
price
spread
would
have
had
to
almost
double
to
around
pence
per
therm
from
around
pence
currently
to
justify
this
cost
monroe
said
that
spread
was
years
ago
