washington
reuters
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
said
on
wednesday
the
trump
administration
wants
sanctions
on
iran
s
crude
exports
to
strain
tehran
but
does
not
want
to
harm
countries
that
depend
on
the
oil
the
united
states
is
preparing
to
impose
the
new
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
industry
after
washington
withdrew
from
a
nuclear
deal
between
tehran
and
other
global
powers
earlier
this
year
but
is
also
considering
offering
waivers
to
some
allies
that
rely
on
iranian
supplies
we
want
to
achieve
maximum
pressure
but
we
don
t
want
to
harm
friends
and
allies
either
bolton
said
in
a
talk
at
the
hamilton
society
bolton
said
the
administration
understands
that
a
number
of
countries
some
close
geographically
to
iran
which
he
visited
last
week
and
others
may
not
be
able
to
go
all
the
way
all
the
way
to
zero
it
was
a
more
conciliatory
tone
about
the
sanctions
from
bolton
a
proponent
of
being
tough
on
iran
and
winding
down
its
crude
exports
to
zero
still
bolton
said
that
consequences
can
already
be
seen
in
iran
including
the
collapse
of
the
rial
its
currency
i
think
it
s
important
that
we
not
relax
in
the
effort
he
said
in
a
presidential
memorandum
addressed
to
secretaries
of
state
treasury
and
energy
trump
said
he
determined
there
was
sufficient
supply
of
petroleum
and
petroleum
products
elsewhere
than
iran
to
permit
a
reduction
in
purchases
from
the
islamic
republic
under
the
law
the
president
must
periodically
issue
a
determination
on
whether
there
is
sufficient
supply
in
the
market
from
sources
for
countries
to
significantly
cut
their
iranian
purchases
the
administration
s
renewed
sanctions
are
set
to
come
into
effect
on
under
law
washington
can
sanction
the
financial
institutions
of
foreign
countries
that
fail
to
significantly
reduce
their
purchases
of
iranian
oil
and
petroleum
products
the
purpose
of
the
law
which
came
into
effect
during
the
obama
administration
was
to
put
pressure
on
iran
to
curtail
its
nuclear
programme
by
forcing
its
major
oil
customers
to
reduce
their
purchases
three
of
iran
s
five
largest
buyers
of
crude
china
india
and
turkey
have
resisted
calls
by
washington
to
end
their
oil
purchases
outright
this
week
south
korea
asked
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
for
maximum
flexibility
on
its
request
for
a
waiver
to
prevent
companies
there
from
being
hit
by
the
sanctions
other
countries
including
iraq
and
afghanistan
depend
on
some
imports
from
iran
the
administration
has
said
it
is
considering
waivers
on
a
basis
