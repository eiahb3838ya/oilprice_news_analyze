in
venezuela
but
pdvsa
had
not
transferred
any
money
to
ongc
videsh
in
over
a
year
the
sources
said
due
to
venezuela
s
economic
meltdown
and
sanctions
that
complicate
payments
through
banks
that
had
made
it
difficult
to
pay
in
cash
that
changed
when
some
barrels
of
venezuelan
crude
left
venezuela

main
oil
port
of

recently
has
begun
paying
some
creditors

in
oil
to
avoid
further
asset
seizures
the

also
seeking
to
stimulate
investment
in
venezuela

unraveling
oil
industry
where

production
is
at
its
lowest
in
almost
seven
decades
by

foreign
partners
