washington
reuters
the
supreme
court
on
wednesday
appeared
unlikely
to
revive
a
lawsuit
by
villagers
in
india
seeking
to
hold
a
international
financial
institution
responsible
for
environmental
damage
they
blame
on
a
power
plant
it
financed
the
justices
heard
an
hour
of
arguments
in
an
appeal
by
the
villagers
of
a
lower
court
ruling
that
the
international
finance
corp
part
of
the
world
bank
group
was
immune
from
such
lawsuits
under
law
several
justices
expressed
scepticism
towards
the
villagers
legal
argument
signalling
the
court
was
likely
to
back
the
ifc
a
ruling
is
due
by
the
end
of
june
the
ifc
provided
million
in
loans
in
to
help
construct
the
tata
mundra
power
plant
in
gujarat
india
ifc
loans
include
provisions
requiring
that
certain
environmental
standards
are
met
lead
plaintiff
budha
ismail
jam
and
other
fisherman
and
farmers
living
near
the
plant
sued
in
federal
court
in
washington
in
saying
the
ifc
failed
to
meet
its
obligations
the
legal
question
is
whether
there
are
limits
to
immunity
for
entities
like
the
ifc
under
the
international
organizations
immunity
act
as
there
are
for
foreign
countries
under
a
law
called
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
the
ifc
expressed
concern
that
a
ruling
against
the
organisation
could
invite
similar
lawsuits
targeting
it
and
other
international
development
banks
justice
stephen
breyer
appeared
to
sympathise
asking
justice
department
lawyer
jonathan
ellis
what
is
the
assurance
that
the
government
can
give
us
that
this
isn
t
going
to
lead
to
a
lot
of
lawsuits
fellow
liberal
justice
elena
kagan
said
the
ifc
s
interpretation
of
the
scope
of
immunity
appears
to
make
a
lot
more
the
villagers
said
the
plant
s
construction
and
operations
did
no
comply
with
the
environmental
plan
set
out
for
the
project
the
local
environment
has
been
devastated
according
to
the
plaintiffs
with
marine
life
killed
by
water
discharges
from
the
plant
s
cooling
system
and
coal
dust
contaminating
the
air
lower
courts
ruled
that
the
lawsuit
was
barred
because
the
ifc
is
immune
from
such
litigation
under
the
law
president
donald
trump
s
administration
backed
the
plaintiffs
saying
international
organizations
should
not
be
given
anything
more
than
the
limited
immunity
foreign
countries
are
accorded
one
of
the
nine
justices
did
not
participate
in
the
case
justice
brett
kavanaugh
who
trump
appointed
was
involved
in
