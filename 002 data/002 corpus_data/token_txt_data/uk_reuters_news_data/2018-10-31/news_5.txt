trump carbon plan attacked by coastal states, lauded by coal interests
washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
s
proposal
to
replace
an
policy
to
fight
climate
change
with
a
weaker
plan
allowing
states
to
write
their
own
rules
on
emissions
from
power
plants
was
criticized
by
coastal
states
but
applauded
by
coal
interests
on
wednesday
under
the
proposed
affordable
clean
energy
plan
that
acting
environmental
protection
agency
epa
chief
andrew
wheeler
issued
in
august
the
federal
government
would
set
carbon
emission
guidelines
but
states
would
have
the
leeway
to
set
less
stringent
standards
on
coal
plants
taking
into
account
the
age
and
upgrade
costs
of
facilities
the
heads
of
environmental
and
energy
agencies
from
mostly
coastal
states
including
california
new
york
and
north
carolina
told
the
epa
in
joint
comments
on
the
trump
plan
that
it
would
result
in
minimal
reductions
of
greenhouse
gases
and
possibly
result
in
increased
emissions
relative
to
having
no
federal
program
on
the
pollution
we
urge
epa
to
abandon
this
proposal
and
instead
to
maintain
or
update
the
obama
era
clean
power
plan
which
the
states
said
would
fulfill
epa
s
obligations
under
federal
clean
air
law
and
support
the
efforts
of
states
to
mitigate
the
effects
of
climate
change
some
states
including
new
york
and
virginia
have
threatened
to
sue
the
epa
if
the
plan
becomes
law
the
comment
period
on
the
plan
ends
on
wednesday
night
and
a
final
rule
from
the
epa
is
expected
later
this
year
coal
and
some
utility
interests
lauded
the
trump
plan
the
proposed
ace
rule
is
a
welcome
return
to
federal
restraint
after
years
of
punitive
overreach
said
hal
quinn
the
president
and
ceo
of
the
national
mining
association
an
industry
group
the
coal
industry
had
said
president
barack
obama
s
climate
regulations
represented
a
war
on
coal
but
trump
s
promises
to
reduce
regulations
have
not
led
to
a
revival
as
the
industry
struggles
with
competition
from
an
abundance
of
cheap
natural
gas
ongoing
closings
of
plants
have
pushed
coal
consumption
by
utilities
this
year
to
the
lowest
since
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
in
august
the
epa
projected
the
plan
would
result
in
million
a
year
in
economic
benefits
and
reduce
retail
power
prices
by
up
to
percent
by
the
epa
also
forecast
that
under
the
rule
coal
production
would
rise
by
up
to
percent
by
the
plan
which
had
been
put
on
hold
by
the
supreme
court
set
overall
goals
for
each
state
