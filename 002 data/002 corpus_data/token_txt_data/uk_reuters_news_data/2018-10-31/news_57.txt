poll-iran sanctions seen keeping oil above $75, but 2019 demand outlook darkens
reuters
oil
is
likely
to
stay
above
a
barrel
fueled
by
supply
disruptions
exacerbated
by
sanctions
on
iran
but
further
gains
could
be
limited
as
economists
and
analysts
see
demand
growth
slowing
next
year
due
to
trade
wars
and
economic
weakness
a
survey
of
economists
and
analysts
forecast
brent
crude
to
average
a
barrel
in
up
from
the
forecast
in
september
the
price
is
expected
to
average
in
versus
the
average
so
far
this
year
analysts
who
spoke
to
reuters
said
demand
is
expected
to
decelerate
in
if
concern
over
a
widespread
economic
slowdown
proves
to
be
justified
overall
global
oil
demand
is
projected
to
grow
by
between
and
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
a
range
that
generally
falls
short
of
the
million
bpd
forecast
for
next
year
by
the
international
energy
agency
in
october
brent
neared
a
barrel
earlier
in
the
year
following
efforts
to
isolate
iran
through
renewed
sanctions
but
prices
have
since
edged
off
those
highs
and
brent
is
now
around
analysts
worry
that
there
is
a
lack
of
spare
capacity
to
deal
with
potential
outages
elsewhere
once
the
sanctions
take
effect
on
on
the
supply
side
concerns
about
falling
supplies
from
a
number
of
opec
producers
primarily
iran
owing
to
the
renewed
sanctions
and
also
venezuela
angola
libya
and
nigeria
will
maintain
upward
pressure
on
prices
said
cailin
birch
an
analyst
at
the
economist
intelligence
unit
the
sanctions
against
iran
s
crude
exports
are
expected
to
tighten
supply
especially
to
asia
which
takes
most
of
the
country
s
shipments
apart
from
saudi
arabia
and
russia
few
producers
can
fill
any
gap
left
by
iran
according
to
frank
schallenberger
head
of
commodity
research
at
lbbw
i
expect
saudi
arabia
and
russia
to
raise
output
if
necessary
as
a
shortage
on
the
supply
side
and
an
even
higher
oil
price
could
be
a
major
risk
to
the
global
economy

despite
concerns
about

analysts
said
headwinds
to
global
growth
could
hurt
demand
in
the
coming
year
particularly
as
the
united
states
and
china
engage
in
a
trade
war
that
has
imposed
billions

russell
hardy
said
the
firm
had
lowered
its
outlook
for
oil
demand
growth
to
million
bpd
from
million
previously
potential
variables
for
global
oil
demand
include
trade
protectionist
policies
currency
woes
and
the
effects
of
tighter
monetary
policy
said
benjamin
lu
a
commodities
analyst
with
phillip
futures
the
iea
said
world
oil
consumption
would
top
million
bpd
in
the
final
quarter
of
this
year
putting
upward
pressure
on
prices
although
crises
and
trade
disputes
could
dent
this
demand
major
producers
led
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
agreed
in
june
to
relax
their
oil
production
cuts
but
the
group
said
it
may
need
to
change
course
because
of
rising
inventories
and
economic
uncertainties

six
of
the
analysts
surveyed
expected
supply
from
producers
to
increase
by
an
average
million
bpd
next
year
mainly
driven
by
gains
in
shale
output
which
has
been
constrained
by
a
lack
of
available
transportation
capacity
current
pipeline
bottlenecks
in
the
prove
to
be
a
obstacle
the
situation
should
improve
next
year
thanks
to
the
commissioning
of
additional
pipeline
capacities
said
carsten
fritsch
senior
commodity
analyst
at
commerzbank
the
price
gap
between
brent
and
wti
crude
is
expected
to
narrow
as
a
result
of
new
pipeline
capacity
coming
onstream
in
the
midwest
next
year
that
will
release
new
supply
on
to
the
global
market
fritsch
said
crude
futures
were
forecast
to
average
a
barrel
in
compared
with
the
consensus
