its

clariant
was
more
affected
as
contracts
for
its

chemicals
that
speed
up
the
manufacturing
of
other
products
that
were
spurring
growth
came
to
an
end
i
understand
the
concern
jany
said
but
the
percent
we
show
now
in
the
third
quarter
is
not
a
reflection
of
a
significant
slowdown
it
is
probably
more
the
normal
days
you
would
expect
to
have
in
its
catalyst
sales
fell
percent
which
analysts
at
zuercher
kantonalbank
said
were
worse
than
expected
but
were
offset
by
a
better
performance
of
care
chemicals
for

by

the
company
confirmed
its
outlook
of
achieving
sales
growth
in
local

higher
operating
cash
flow
and
an
improvement
in
profit
margins
still
operating
profit
as
a
percentage
of
sales
stagnated
at
percent
in
the
quarter
and
at
percent
in
the
first
nine
months
shy
of
the
percent
it
is
aiming
for
by
as
it
deepens
its
sabic
partnership
the
slowdown
in
the
middle
east
and
africa
where
sales
slipped
percent
was
largely
driven
by
turkey
where
a
crumbling
lira
hit
results
and
south
africa
s
recession
though
sabic
is
clariant
s
biggest
shareholder
jany
did
not
foresee
much
impact
should
the
kingdom
face
global
sanctions
over
jamal
khashoggi
s
death
it
may
have
some
repercussions
on

in

on

business
no
