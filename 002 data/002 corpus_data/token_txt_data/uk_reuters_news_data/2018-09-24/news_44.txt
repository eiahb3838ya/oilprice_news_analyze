iran
will
export
significantly
less
oil
than
was
initially
expected
when
the
united
states
first
announced
it
would
reimpose
sanctions
on
tehran
and
that
should
boost
prices
a
senior
executive
at
commodities
trader
trafigura
said
on
monday
i
think
when
the
sanctions
were
first
announced
a
number
of
months
ago
people
were
estimating
the
cut
may
be
to
ben
luckock
of
oil
trading
at
trafigura
told
reporters
i
think
the
consensus
has
moved
to
it
s
going
to
be
well
beyond
million
bpd
that
s
cut
and
maybe
million
buyers
across
asia
have
come
under
pressure
to
reduce
their
iranian
oil
imports
as
washington
aims
to
cut
exports
from
opec
s
exporter
to
zero
to
force
tehran
to
renegotiate
a
nuclear
treaty
still
luckock
says
chinese
companies
will
likely
continue
to
import
iranian
oil
while
other
traditional
customers
may
cut
volumes
but
not
reduce
imports
to
zero
export
of
iranian
oil
is
not
going
to
be
zero
but
it
is
going
to
be
significantly
less
than
it
was
and
probably
lower
than
most
people
expected
when
sanctions
were
announced
and
hence
the
higher
oil
prices
he
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
asia
pacific
petroleum
conference
appec
in
singapore
iraqi
and
mexican
oil
have
been
favoured
by
buyers
as
alternatives
to
iranian
crude
he
said
also
to
counter
falling
supply
from
iran
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
other
producers
are
considering
raising
output
by
bpd
luckock
said
earlier
during
the
conference
that
he
expects
oil
prices
could
rise
to
per
barrel
by
christmas
and
per
barrel
by
the
new
year
from
nearly
a
barrel
now
for
brent
crude
due
to
robust
global
oil
demand
production
decline
from
venezuela
and
firm
global
oil
demand
are
also
likely
to
boost
oil
prices
said
luckock
who
was
promoted
in
july
from
his
previous
role
as
of
risk
new
refining
capacity
being
added
in
asia
will
also
likely
provide
incremental
demand
for
crude
oil
he
said
these
are
exciting
times
with
a
bunch
of
new
refineries
coming
online
and
a
bunch
of
dislocation
in
the
crude
oil
market
around
the
world
so
we
really
should
have
incremental
volatility
going
forward
he
said
luckock
also
said
that
while
this
year
has
been
challenging
for
the
industry
next
year
is
looking
more
bullish
