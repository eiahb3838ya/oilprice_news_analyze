update 1-big oil pledges to slash potent greenhouse gas emission
london
reuters
a
group
of
the
world
s
top
oil
and
gas
companies
pledged
on
monday
to
slash
emissions
of
a
potent
greenhouse
gas
by
a
fifth
by
in
an
effort
to
battle
climate
change
the
oil
and
gas
climate
initiative
ogci
which
giants
exxon
mobil
and
chevron
joined
recently
committed
to
cutting
methane
emissions
to
an
intensity
of
percent
of
the
group
s
total
fossil
fuel
production
it
said
in
a
statement
such
a
reduction
would
equate
to
tonnes
of
methane
annually
it
compares
with
a
baseline
intensity
of
percent
in
excluding
new
members
the
pledge
which
could
be
lowered
further
to
percent
intensity
echoes
targets
set
individually
by
members
bp
royal
dutch
shell
and
exxon
to
reduce
methane
emissions
our
aim
is
to
work
towards
near
zero
methane
emissions
from
the
full
gas
value
chain
in
support
of
achieving
the
goals
of
the
paris
climate
agreement
the
heads
of
the
ogci
members
said
in
a
statement
referring
to
an
international
agreement
aimed
at
limiting
global
warming
the
ogci
today
represents
nearly
a
third
of
global
oil
and
gas
production
it
also
includes
bp
royal
dutch
shell
france
s
total
as
well
as
national
oil
companies
of
china
mexico
brazil
and
saudi
arabia
the
environment
defense
fund
edf
a
organisation
said
ogci
needs
to
adopt
more
and
transparent
ways
of
measuring
methane
emissions
to
meet
the
target
it
will
be
critical
now
for
companies
to
follow
through
on
their
commitment
reporting
on
progress
with
actual
measured
emissions
fully
and
publicly
disclosed
edf
president
fred
krupp
said
in
a
statement
a
second
challenge
for
ogci
is
the
risk
that
laggards
in
the
industry
hide
behind
their
efforts
falsely
claiming
that
the
actions
of
an
important
few
represent
what
all
in
the
industry
are
in
a
separate
announcement
timed
to
coincide
with
the
start
of
climate
week
in
new
york
ogci
announced
the
creation
of
a
million
climate
investment
fund
with
china
national
petroleum
corporation
cnpc
the
group
is
investing
in
new
technologies
including
satellite
imagery
to
help
measure
and
detect
methane
leaks
from
pipelines
wells
and
other
infrastructure
said
pratima
rangarajan
head
of
ogci
climate
investments
today
there
is
no
global
measurement
so
what
you
don
t
measure
you
don
t
fix
or
operate
as
well
as
you
should
