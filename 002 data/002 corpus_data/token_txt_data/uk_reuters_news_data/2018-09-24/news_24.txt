royal
dutch
shell
wants
to
reweight
its
footprint
in
nigeria
to
focus
on
oil
and
gas
fields
far
offshore
away
from
the
theft
spills
corruption
and
unrest
that
have
plagued
the
west
african
country
s
onshore
industry
for
decades
but
for
the
company
that
pioneered
nigeria
s
oil
industry
in
the
the
niger
delta
remains
as
important
and
problematic
as
ever
while
shell
has
cut
onshore
oil
production
and
sold
some
onshore
assets
it
continues
to
invest
in
others
in
fact
onshore
production
has
risen
in
recent
years
as
a
share
of
shell
s
output
in
nigeria
an
analysis
of
company
data
over
the
past
decade
shows
much
of
the
increase
comes
from
less
polluting
gas
used
mainly
in
power
generation
which
shell
thinks
will
be
key
to
the
transition
to
lower
carbon
energy
gas
made
up
percent
of
onshore
production
in
up
from
percent
in
the
company
still
controls
thousands
of
kilometres
of
pipelines
connecting
inland
fields
to
coastal
terminals
through
its
subsidiary
shell
petroleum
development
co
of
nigeria
spdc
however
so
while
spdc
has
cut
oil
production
in
the
delta
by
percent
since
when
it
first
started
reporting
data
on
spills
the
incidence
of
spills
and
theft
from
pipelines
has
fallen
at
a
much
lower
rate
and
has
picked
up
again
recently
the
data
shows
shell
s
nigeria
country
chair
osagie
okunbor
hinted
it
was
a
sensitive
balancing
act
we
are
too
big
just
to
see
ourselves
as
there
is
a
problem
and
we
have
to
run
that
is
not
what
we
are
thinking
of
doing
he
told
reporters
on
a
media
trip
to
the
country
in
july
but
at
the
same
time
we
don
t
want
to
spread
our
two
pipeline
spills
in
in
the
small
community
of
bodo
in
ogoniland
are
emblematic
of
the
problems
in
the
delta
a
vast
maze
of
creeks
and
mangrove
swamps
by
pipelines
and
blighted
by
poverty
and
violence
on
a
speedboat
trip
to
the
site
of
a
operation
launched
by
shell
last
year
a
makeshift
oil
refinery
stood
idle
on
a
charred
landing
the
ground
was
soaked
with
oil
the
air
heavy
with
petrol
fumes
and
slicks
glistened
in
the
water
nearby
there
were
few
signs
of
birds
or
fish
so
far
this
year
crude
spills
have
been
recorded
already
higher
than
the
previous
two
years
in
militant
attacks
pushed
the
volume
of
spills
to
more
than
barrels
a
high
since
oil
theft
from
spdc
rose
to
around
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
a
loss
of
nearly
million
for
the
year
from
bpd
the
year
before
despite
all
the
problems
and
costs
however
nigerian
onshore
operations
generate
billions
of
dollars
annually
shell
does
not
break
down
profits
by
country
but
a
report
on
payments
to
governments
that
the
company
publishes
annually
showed
it
paid
around
billion
in
royalties
taxes
and
fees
to
the
nigerian
government
in
that
means
shell
earned
more
than
billion
from
oil
and
gas
production
in
nigeria
in
around
percent
of
its
total
global
output
a
shell
spokesman
declined
to
comment
on
the
specifics
of
reuters
data
analysis
the
nigerian
petroleum
ministry
declined
to
comment
shell
has
shown
it
can
shut
down
if
it
is
not
making
money
it
stopped
producing
oil
completely
in
iraq
last
year
after
half
a
century
in
the
country
although
it
retains
substantial
gas
operations
it
s
hard
to
think
shell
would
stay
put
onshore
and
weather
all
the
problems
if
the
assets
didn
t
offer
decent
returns
said
aaron
sayne
a
financial
crime
lawyer
working
at
the
natural
resource
governance
institute
nrgi
to
some
extent
the
onshore
must
still
be
worth
the
shell
remains
central
to
nigeria
s
economy
and
society
spdc
operated
by
shell
with
a
percent
stake
while
the
nigerian
national
petroleum
co
has
percent
france
s
total
has
percent
and
italy
s
eni
has
percent
is
the
country
s
largest
oil
joint
venture
employing
thousands
the
giant
s
operations
drew
unwelcome
attention
in
the
early
when
residents
of
the
delta
s
ogoni
region
called
for
fairer
distribution
of
oil
wealth
and
compensation
for
spills
the
government
cracked
down
and
in
executed
nine
protest
leaders
including
prominent
writer
ken
prompting
shell
to
end
production
in
the
area
forever
it
retained
control
of
the
pipeline
however
and
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
later
little
seems
to
have
changed
on
the
ground
in
shell
accepted
responsibility
for
operational
faults
that
caused
the
spills
that
dumped
tens
of
thousands
of
oil
barrels
into
creeks
around
bodo
and
paid
a
settlement
of
million
pounds
to
villagers
dozens
of
spills
since
including
one
by
a
barge
carrying
stolen
oil
that
sunk
in
july
are
frustrating
remediation
efforts
officials
said
you
clean
it
up
you
walk
away
somebody
goes
back
there
and
does
the
same
thing
it
s
like
going
around
in
circles
said
ogonnaya
iroakasi
ogoni
restoration
project
supervisor
and
an
spdc
member
around
percent
of
the
spills
are
a
result
of
sabotage
shell
data
shows
shell
has
taken
a
number
of
steps
to
improve
the
situation
in
the
area
including
training
youth
to
start
up
businesses
and
funding
local
community
patrols
campaigns
to
raise
local
awareness
and
even
a
local
radio
station
but
critics
say
it
is
not
enough
i
am
not
minimizing
the
challenge
of
but
shell
are
not
doing
enough
to
solve
it
said
daniel
leader
the
bodo
community
s
lead
uk
lawyer
the
pipelines
are
not
equipped
with
the
most
basic
leak
detection
technology
and
shell
is
simply
not
present
on
the
ground
in
these
local
residents
are
frustrated
as
the
slow
process
stops
many
from
fishing
one
of
the
main
sources
of
income
much
of
the
anger
is
focused
on
shell
but
eni
has
also
struggled
to
cope
in
recent
years
since
starting
to
report
data
to
authorities
in
the
italian
company
has
recorded
more
spills
than
shell
according
to
amnesty
international
please
don
t
give
up
on
us
i
hope
that
you
guys
here
can
force
shell
to
do
the
right
thing
michael
porobunu
chairman

gokana
council
of

told
the
crew
and
reporters
on
his
porch
spdc
has
sold
of
the
field
licences
in
the
delta
it
held
in
mostly
to
local
companies
it
has
applied
to
renew
the
remaining
licences
which
expire
next
year
the
divestments
are
a
reminder
of
another
cost
of
doing
business
in
nigeria
corruption
shell
has
filed
a
criminal
complaint
against
a
former
senior
employee
over
suspected
bribes
in
the
million
sale
of
oil
mining
licence
to
local
firm
neconde
in
offshore
operations
are
an
attractive
alternative
to
the
delta
in
many
ways
the
bonga
field
km
miles
off
the
coast
is
one
of
shell
s
prized
assets
since
starting
up
in
the
giant
tanker
with
a

platform
that
pumps
barrels
of
oil
and
million
cubic
feet
of
gas

bribery
allegations
in
a

court
over
the
purchase

drilling
offshore
is
also
more
expensive
and
technically
complex
shell
and
its
partners
will
decide
next
year
on
whether
to
develop
a
new
offshore
field
