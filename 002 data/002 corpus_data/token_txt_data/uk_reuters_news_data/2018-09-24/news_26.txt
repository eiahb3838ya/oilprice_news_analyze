stumbled

on

as
china
s

with

were

on
monday
while
currency
markets
were
subdued
as
banks
in

countries
were
shut
investors
were
squarely
focused
on
the
trade
war
as
china
added
billion
of
products
to
its
import
tariff
list
retaliating
against
duties
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
that
came
into
effect
at
gmt
monday
china
also
cancelled
trade
talks
with
the
united
states
as
well
as
a
proposed
visit
to
washington
by
vice
premier
liu
he
which
had
been
scheduled
for
this
week
the
wall
street
journal
reported
soon
after
the
duties
went
into
effect
china
accused
the
united
states
of
engaging
in
trade
bullyism
the
official
xinhua
news
agency
said
xinhua
cited
a
white
paper
on
the
trade
dispute
published
by
the
state
council
to
say
china
was
willing
to
restart
negotiations
with
the
united
states
in
an
equal
and
mutually
beneficial
this
shows
china
will
not
hold
talks
under
tariff
threats
said
frances
cheung
head
of
asia
for
westpac
if
the
united
states
is
using
threat
as
a
tactic
it
does
not
seem
to
work
cheung
added
markets
have
low
expectation
that
a
deal
can
be
reached
before
the
intensifying
dispute
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
has
spooked
financial
markets
worried
about
the
impact
on
global
growth
the
japanese
yen
which
sees
fund
inflows
during
times
of
crisis
held
above
a
recent
trough
at
per
dollar
while
the
australian
dollar
slipped
from
a
week
top
to
both
the
and
china
are
digging
in
and
increasingly
the
subtext
seems
to
be
as
much
about
advancing
a
trade
ideology
as
it
is
about
rescinding
trade
tariffs
said
john
bilton
head
of
global
strategy
at
jpmorgan
asset
management
as
a
result
both
the
extent
and
depth
of
any
economic
impact
are
being
recalibrated
bilton
said
so
while
we
continue
to
be
constructive
on
the
global
economy
over
the
coming
quarters
it
is
hard
to
see
the
current
surge
in
activity
morphing
into
another
period
of
coordinated
global
britain
s
negotiation
with
european
union
will
be
another
key
issue
for
investors
with
risks
of
a
no
deal
or
hard
brexit
shooting
up
again
on
friday
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
said
talks
with
the
european
union
had
hit
an
impasse
after
the
bloc
s
leaders
rejected
her
chequers
plan
without
fully
explaining
why
opposition
leader
jeremy
corbyn
said
on
sunday
he
would
back
a
second
brexit
referendum
if
his
labour
party
votes
to
pursue
the
move
heaping
more
pressure
on
may
amid
speculation
that
she
could
opt
to
call
a
snap

elections

its

since
early

on
friday
late
last
week
the
dollar
was
hammered
as
investors
ramped
up
bets
that
the
federal
reserve
will
be
near
the
end
of
its
cycle
after
an
expected
increase
this
week
oil

opec

saudi
