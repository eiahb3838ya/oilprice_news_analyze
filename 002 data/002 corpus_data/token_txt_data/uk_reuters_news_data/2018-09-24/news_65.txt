the
united
states
has
sent
mixed
messages
to
opec
and
its
allies
over
the
last
week
about
whether
they
need
to
do
more
to
raise
oil
production
and
hold
down
prices
the
opec
monopoly
must
get
prices
down
now
president
donald
trump
demanded
on
twitter
on
we
protect
the
countries
of
the
middle
east
they
would
not
be
safe
for
very
long
without
us
and
yet
they
continue
to
push
for
higher
and
higher
oil
prices
he
complained
we
will
remember
the
president
added
implying
that
security
support
might
be
reassessed
if
opec
members
fail
to
cut
crude
prices
but
just
seven
days
earlier
the
president
s
own
energy
secretary
had
told
reporters
that
saudi
arabia
opec
and
russia
are
to
be
admired
and
appreciated
for
raising
their
production
to
avoid
a
spike
in
oil
prices
the
mixed
messages
illustrate
the
narrow
and
difficult
path
the
administration
is
trying
to
take
imposing
tough
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
exports
without
sending
prices
sharply
higher
the
united
states
is
coordinating
policy
on
sanctions
and
production
closely
with
both
saudi
arabia
and
russia
the
energy
secretary
has
met
both
his
saudi
and
russian
counterparts
in
the
last
fortnight
at
the
same
time
the
white
house
is
anxious
to
avoid
being
blamed
by
motorists
for
any
further
escalation
in
the
cost
of
oil
and
gasoline
especially
in
the
to
a
tough
congressional
election
on
but
perhaps
afterwards
too
in
effect
there
are
two
separate
policies
or
at
least
two
different
messages
one
run
by
the
president
and
the
other
by
his
administration
it
is
not
unusual
for
governments
to
try
to
run
multiple
policies
and
messages
addressed
to
different
audiences
and
intended
to
achieve
different
objectives
though
it
risks
creating
confusion
and
disappointment
the
president
has
criticised
opec
for
rising
oil
prices
four
times
on
twitter
this
year
as
well
as
in
an
interview
with
fox
news
the
president
s
tweets
have
generally
been
prompted
when
brent
crude
prices
have
recently
risen
sharply
and
are
in
the
range
from
the
president
s
behaviour
it
is
possible
to
infer
that
he
doesn
t
want
prices
to
rise
above
per
barrel
and
would
prefer
them
closer
to
or
even
below
the
president
s
tweets
are
creating
an
implicit
price
target
even
if
officials
have
been
careful
not
to
specify
an
explicit
one
so
far
the
president
has
been
careful
to
blame
opec
and
unspecified
countries
in
the
middle
east
for
rising
oil
prices
eschewing
identifying
individual
countries
by
name
as
a
practical
matter
saudi
arabia
the
united
arab
emirates
and
kuwait
are
the
only
opec
members
that
have
significant
volumes
of
spare
capacity
and
could
raise
output
but
all
three
are
close
allies
of
the
united
states
and
saudi
arabia
and
united
arab
emirates
have
been
at
the
forefront
pushing
for
tough
sanctions
on
fellow
opec
member
iran
the
president
has
so
far
been
careful
to
avoid
embarrassing
them
by
identifying
them
individually
though
his
tweets
have
left
no
ambiguity
about
their
target
for
the
time
being
the
president
may
be
content
to
complain
on
twitter
but
do
little
else
in
order
to
avoid
being
blamed
for
the
rise
in
oil
prices
that
is
a
byproduct
of
his
sanctions
policy
however
if
oil
prices
continue
rising
and
hit
or
even
the
president
s
tweets
may
become
more
pointed
and
the
white
house
could
take
tougher
action
to
raise
the
political
pressure
on
riyadh
oil
prices
are
now
hovering
uncertainly
amid
dwindling
exports
from
iran
poor

from
other
opec
members
and
brazil
decelerating
