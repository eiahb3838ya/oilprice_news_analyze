venezuela
s
new
digital
fuel
payment
system
got
off
to
a
slow
start
on
monday
as
most
drivers
paid
with
cash
and
only
a
handful
of
gas
stations
were
equipped
with
the
system
that
president
nicolas
maduro
says
will
limit
fuel
smuggling
the
new
system
entails
venezuelans
applying
for
and
using
a
digital
identification
document
to
pay
for
fuel
with
the
government
providing
gas
stations
with
wireless
devices
that
will
read
the
card
leftist
maduro
has
said
the
system
will
limit
the
trading
of
gas
which
is
so
heavily
subsidized
that
drivers
often
do
not
even
bother
paying
for
it
last
week
he
said
the
new
payment
system
would
roll
out
on
monday
that
followed
a
pilot
earlier
this
month
in
border
states
where
fuel
smugglers
are
the
most
active
though
drivers
at
the
time
said
the
system
was
not
functioning
gas
station
employees
and
drivers
that
reuters
spoke
to
on
monday
said
the
system
was
not
fully
operational
right
now
payments
aren
t
being
made
with
the
system
it
s
only
to
show
how
it
works
said
an
employee
of
a
gas
station
in
caracas
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
this
is
a
test
phase
it
s
a
the
information
ministry
did
not
immediately
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
maduro
has
said
gasoline
prices
will
rise
to
international
levels
by
october
but
has
provided
no
details
on
what
the
prices
would
be
the
issue
has
been
politically
delicate
since
a
austerity
package
that
included
a
fuel
price
hike
triggered
rioting
that
left
thousands
dead
maduro
s
previous
plans
to
raise
gasoline
prices
have
either
been
abandoned
or
resulted
in
insignificant
increases
that
were
quickly
overtaken
by
inflation
many
venezuelans
reuters
spoke
to
said
they
were
confused
about
what
the
new
prices
will
be
and
called
the
card
a
mechanism
to
withhold
benefits
and
services
from
those
who
oppose
maduro
to
me
this
system
is
garbage
said
mercedes
fernandez
a
systems
engineer
we
don
t
even
know
how
much
it
s
going
to
cost
or
how
we
re
going
to
fernandez
shortly
thereafter
filled
her
tank
and
paid
for
the
fuel
with
a
bank
note
worth
bolivars
currently
the
smallest
denomination
of
legal
tender
the
combination
of
fixed
fuel
prices
and
annual
inflation
now
topping
percent
has
made
gasoline
so
cheap
as
to
be
effectively
free
for
the
amount
it
costs
to
buy
one
kilo
pounds
of
cheese
a
driver
could
fill
their
tank
