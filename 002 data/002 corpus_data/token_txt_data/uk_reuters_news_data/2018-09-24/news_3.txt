joined
the

the

benchmark
crude
futures
are
currently
deliverable
at
cushing
oklahoma
however
the
growth
in
exports
has
underscored
the
hub
s
waning
influence
as
the
primary
measuring
stick
for
the
oil
market
and
the
leading
barometer
of
future
supply
demand
and
prices
cme

announcement
comes

said

record
crude
production
and
exports
this
year
have
put
the
spotlight
on
the
gulf
coast
and
in
particular
houston
as
a
vital
pricing
center
the
united
states
lifted
a
ban
on
crude
oil
exports
in
late
and
since
then
tankers
filled
with
crude
have
landed
in
more
than
countries
cme
expects
market
participants
to
trade
its
new
houston
contract
largely
as
a
spread
and
as
a
result
boost
liquidity
in
its
cushing
contract
as
well
we
re
not
seeing
this
as
in
any
way
a
replacement
for
cushing
