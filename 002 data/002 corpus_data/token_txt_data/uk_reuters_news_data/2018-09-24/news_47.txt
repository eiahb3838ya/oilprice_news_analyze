reuters
engie
said
its
core
earnings
will
be
slightly
below
the
utility
s
target
due
to
outages
at
its
belgian
nuclear
plants
but
the
belgian
nuclear
availability
rate
should
go
back
to
at
least
percent
by
next
year
on
friday
the
french
gas
and
power
group
warned
that
the
belgian
outages
would
push
its
net
recurring
income
to
the
low
end
of
its
billion
euros
billion
forecast
range
but
did
not
mention
core
earnings
before
interest
tax
depreciation
and
amortisation
ebitda
we
expect
ebitda
to
be
slightly
below
the
indication
that
we
had
given
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
engie
chief
financial
officer
judith
hartmann
said
on
a
call
with
analysts
in
february
engie
had
said
it
aimed
for
core
earnings
of
to
billion
euros
hartmann
said
the
impact
of
the
belgian
outages
on
capital
expenditure
would
be
limited
as
the
repair
work
on
the
reactor
s
degraded
concrete
was
not
excessively
costly
the
capex
impact
for
the
outages
is
quite
limited
in
the
dozens
of
millions
but
not
anything
very
significant
at
the
scale
of
the
company
she
said
those
are
big
works
but
they
are
not
very
sophisticated
technically
she
added
hartmann
said
the
belgian
reactor
s
availability
which
will
come
in
at
just
percent
this
year
should
go
back
to
at
least
percent
next
year
asked
whether
the
belgian
fleet
could
go
back
to
availability
rates
of
percent
in
coming
years
she
said
the
company
would
be
working
on
that
it
is
percent
in
a
normal
year
and
has
been
higher
than
that
in
most
of
the
past
years
except
in
the
past
it
was
around
percent
so
over
time
it
should
normalise
she
said
engie
s
belgian
unit
electrabel
operates
seven
nuclear
reactors
in
belgium
four
at
doel
and
three
at
tihange
which
produce
about
half
the
country
s
electricity
when
they
are
fully
operational
only
two
belgian
reactors
are
in
operation
at
the
moment
namely
the
doel
and
tihange
reactors
three
have
been
halted
for
extended
maintenance
since
the
spring
while
two
have
been
out
since
august
they
are
expected
to
come
back
online
between
december
and
the
end
of
may
