shares
stumbled
in
trading
on
monday
as
china
ramped
up
trade
tensions
by

with

was
in

as
financial
markets
in

asian
centres
japan
china
and

were
closed

investors
were
squarely
focused
on
the
trade
war
as
china
added
billion
of
products
to
its
import
tariff
list
retaliating
against
duties
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
that
come
into
effect
on
monday
china
also
cancelled
trade
talks
with
the
united
states
as
well
as
a
proposed
visit
to
washington
by
vice
premier
liu
he
originally
scheduled
for
this
week
the
wall
street
journal
reported
the
united
states
meanwhile
does
not
have
a
date
for
further
talks
the
intensifying
dispute
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
has
spooked
financial
markets
worried
about
the
fallout
on
global
growth
the
japanese
yen
which
sees
fund
inflows
during
times
of
crisis
held
above
a
recent
trough
at
per
dollar
while
the
australian
dollar
slipped
from
a
week
top
to
both
the
and
china
are
digging
in
and
increasingly
the
subtext
seems
to
be
as
much
about
advancing
a
trade
ideology
as
it
is
about
rescinding
trade
tariffs
said
john
bilton
head
of
global
strategy
at
jpmorgan
asset
management
as
a
result
both
the
extent
and
depth
of
any
economic
impact
are
being
recalibrated
bilton
said
so
while
we
continue
to
be
constructive
on
the
global
economy
over
the
coming
quarters
it
is
hard
to
see
the
current
surge
in
activity
morphing
into
another
period
of
coordinated
global
there
was
some
optimism
generally
about
chinese
growth
as
authorities
in
beijing
step
up
policy
stimulus
to
offset
the
economic
impact
of
the
tariffs
chinese
premier
li
keqiang
said
over
the
weekend
china
will
cut
import
and
export
costs
for
foreign
firms
as
it
looks
to
promote
an
image
of
being
open
for
business
britain
s
negotiation
with
european
union
will
be
another
key
issue
for
investors
with
risks
of
a
no
deal
or
hard
brexit
shooting
up
again
on
friday
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
said
talks
with
the
european
union
had
hit
an
impasse
after
the
bloc
s
leaders
rejected
her
chequers
plan
without
fully
explaining
why
the
pound
fell
as
much
as

friday

biggest

its
weakest

since
early
july
the

was
hammered
late

investors
ramped
up
bets
that
the
federal

will
be
near
