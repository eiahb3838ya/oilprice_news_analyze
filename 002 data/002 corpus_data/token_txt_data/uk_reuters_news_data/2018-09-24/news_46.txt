commodity

said
on
monday
that

rise
to

by

and
pass
in

could

warned

the

exporting
countries
as

russia
are

raising

no
decision
has
been
made

opec
leader
saudi
arabia
and
its
biggest
ally
outside
the
group
russia
on
sunday
ruled
out
any
immediate
extra
increase
in
output
effectively
rebuffing
a
call
by

donald
trump
for
action

cool
the

i

saudi
energy
minister
khalid
told
reporters
as
opec
and
energy
ministers
gathered
in
algiers
for
a
meeting
that
ended
with
no
formal
recommendation
for
any
additional
supply
boost
a
source
familiar
with
opec
discussions
told
reuters
on
friday
that
opec
and
other
producers
have
been
discussing
the
possibility
of
raising
output
by
bpd
we
expect
that
those
opec
countries
with
available
spare
capacity
led
by
saudi
arabia
will
increase
output
but
not
completely
offset
the
drop
in
iranian
barrels
said
edward
bell
commodity
analyst
at
emirates
nbd
bank
morgan
said
in
its
latest
market
outlook
published
on
friday
that
a
spike
to
per
barrel
is
likely
for
oil
prices
in
the
coming
months
due
to
the
iran
sanctions
struggling
with
high
crude
prices
and
a
weak
rupee
indian
refiners
are
preparing
to
cut
back
crude
imports
