the
wall
street
journal
reported
the
united
states
meanwhile
does
not
have
a
date
for
further
talks
the
intensifying
dispute
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
has
spooked
financial
markets
the
japanese
yen
which
sees
fund
inflows
during
times
of
crisis
ticked
up
to
per
dollar
while
the
australian
dollar
slipped
from
a
week
top
to
the
trouble
is
that
further
escalation
is
still
on
the
cards
as
both
sides
are
still
well
apart
on
the
key
issues
said
amp
chief
economist
shane
oliver
trump
remains
defiant
saying
it
s
time
to
take
a
stand
on
china
and
his
threat
to
increase
tariffs
on
all
imports
from
china
remains
oliver
added
he
remained
optimistic
about
chinese
growth
as
authorities
in
beijing
devise
policy
stimulus
to
offset
the
economic
impact
of
the
tariffs
chinese
premier
li
keqiang
said
over
the
weekend
china
will
cut
import
and
export
costs
for
foreign
firms
as
it
looks
to
promote
an
image
of
being
open
for
business
our
view
remains
that
a
negotiated
solution
is
likely
but
its
unlikely
to
come
until
later
this
year
or
early
next
