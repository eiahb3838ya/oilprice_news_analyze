rebuffing

high
near
a
barrel
on
monday

underpinning
the
market
is
the
prospect
of
lower

due

were
unable
and
unwilling
to
add

and
late

can
add
an
extra
million

demand
to

but
energy
minister
khalid
said
on
sunday
such
a
move
was
not
needed
at
the
moment
sunday
s
meeting
appeared
to
leave
unresolved
a
disagreement
which
flared
up
in
june
between
saudi
arabia
and
iran
over
whether
opec
members
are
allowed
to
pump
more
oil
to
make
up
shortfalls
elsewhere
under
pressure
from
trump
opec
and
allies
agreed
in
june
to
boost
production
after
months
of
undersupply
by
opec
countries
including
venezuela
and
angola
and
the
prospect
of
the
iran
sanctions
saudi
arabia
said
the
deal
allowed
countries
able
to
produce
more
such
as
itself
to
go
ahead
and
do
so
to
make
up
for
shortfalls
iran
disagreed
and
kazempour
maintained
that
position
on
monday
extra
production
beyond
opec
quotas
requires
permission
of
the
conference
he
said
assignment
of
opec
share
to
requires
conference
the
next
meeting
of
the
conference
the
full
group
of
opec
and
ministers
is
not
until
december
the
opec
governor
is
typically
the
second
most
senior
post
in
a
country
s
opec
delegation
after
the
oil
minister
iran
s
minister
bijan
zanganeh
was
quoted
on
monday
as
saying
