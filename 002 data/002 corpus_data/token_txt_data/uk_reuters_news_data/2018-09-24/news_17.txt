on
monday
dismissed
iran
s
threats
of
revenge
after
saturday
s
deadly
attack
at
a
military
parade
in
southwestern
iran
and
said
it
was
ludicrous
for
tehran
to
allege
involvement
iran
s
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
said
on
monday
the
attackers
who
killed
people
at

military
parade

arab
emirates
and
that
iran
would
severely
punish
those
behind
the
bloodshed
the
deputy
head
of
iran
s
revolutionary
guards
also
accused
the
united

involvement

the
attack
and
said
they
should
expect
a
devastating
response
mattis
told
reporters
at
the
pentagon
that
iran
s
threat
did
not
give
him
any
concern
we
ve
been
very
clear
that
they
shouldn
t
take
us
on
like
that
and
i
am
hopeful
that
cooler
wiser
heads
will
prevail
mattis
said
they
ve
so
far
blamed
at
least
three
countries
and
i
think
one
terrorist
group
we
ll
see
how
long
the
list
goes
but
it
d
be
good
if
they
knew
what
they
re
talking
about
before
they
started
in
the
southwestern
city
of
ahvaz

packed
the
streets

were
carried

mourners
many
held
pictures
of
a

one
of
the
worst
such
attacks
against
iran
s
most
powerful
military
force
iran
s
intelligence
ministry
said
some
people
had
been
arrested
in
connection
with
the

weapons
explosives

fars
and
irna
news
agencies
said
on
monday
five

were
killed
not
four
as
previously
reported
by
state
media
the
body
of
the
fifth
assailant
had
not
been
identified
as
it
was
mixed
up
with
other
casualties
fars
said
based
on
reports
this
cowardly
act
was
done
by
people
who
the
americans
come
to
help
when
they
are
trapped
in
syria
and
iraq
and
are
paid
by
saudi
arabia
and
the
uae
khamenei
said
on
his
website
guards
brigadier
general
hossein
salami
in
a
speech
broadcast
on
state
tv
said
you
have
seen
our
revenge
before
you
will
see
that
our
response
will
be
crushing
and
devastating
and
you
will
regret
what
you
have
tasnim
news
agency
quoted
salami
as
saying
the
horrific
crime
exposed
the
dark
side
of
an
alliance
that
the
united
states
saudi
arabia
and
israel
had
created
to
counter
iranian
influence
in
the
region
the
secretary
of
iran
s
national
security
council
said
tehran
needed
to
talk
to
its
neighbours
to
avoid
tensions
it
s
essential
to
be
fully
aware
and
increase
our
constructive
dialogues
to
neutralise
the
plots
of
enemies
who
want
to
create
suspicion
and
disagreement
among
regional
countries
ali
shamkhani
said
he
also
said
sanctions
against
iran
were
illegal
and
president
donald
trump
was
using
them
as
a
tool
for
personal
revenge
mattis
said
it
was
clear
that
iran
still
didn
t
know
what
had
happened
he
stressed
the
united
states
had
no
advance
knowledge
that
such
an
attack
was
possible
i
don
t
get
woken
up
with
phone
calls
over
something
we
know
is
going
to
happen
it
s
just
ludicrous
to
say
we
had
anything
to
do
with
it
he
said
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
asked
by
a
fox
news
interviewer
if
the
united
states
played
any
role
in
the
attack
said
when
you
have
a
security
incident
at
home
blaming
others
is
an
enormous
the
loss
of
innocent
lives
was
tragic
pompeo
added
there
has
been
no
reaction
from
saudi
arabia
or
israel
accusations
against
gulf
countries
will
almost
certainly
antagonise
iran
s
regional
foe
saudi
arabia
the
oil
are
waging
a
war
for
influence
across
the
middle
east
backing
opposite
sides
in
syria
yemen
iraq
and
lebanon
it
is
however
highly
unlikely
the
guards
will
strike
any
of
its
foes
directly
and
risk
setting
off
a
regional
conflict
analysts
said
the
violence
has
led
to
a
boost
in
domestic
support
for
the
guards
which
they
could
use
to
silence
their
critics
who
include
pragmatic
president
hassan
rouhani
rouhani
engineered
iran
s
nuclear
deal
with
world
powers
that
ushered
in
a
cautious
detente
with
washington
before
tensions
flared
anew
with
trump
s
decision
in
may
to
pull
out
of
the
accord
and
reimpose
sanctions
on
tehran
iran
s
intelligence
minister
mahmoud
alavi
said
a
network
of

with
the
