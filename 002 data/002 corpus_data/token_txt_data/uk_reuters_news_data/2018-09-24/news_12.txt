reuters
exxon
mobil
corp
royal
dutch
shell
plc
and
other
companies
will
gather
on
friday
in
possibly
their
last
crack
at
brazil
s
coveted
offshore
oil
for
another
four
years
as
a
election
spurs
fears
about
barriers
to
foreign
investment
the
auction
in
rio
de
janeiro
for
four
blocks
in
the
santos
and
campos
basins
comes
just
a
week
before
the
most
unpredictable
presidential
election
in
a
generation
which
features
candidates
that
may
seek
to
slow
the
pace
of
oil
auctions
revise
legislation
or
even
claw
back
oil
areas
already
handed
out
they
can
try
to
revise
the
whole
process
of
opening
up
the
oil
industry
to
international
oil
companies
said
an
oil
services
industry
executive
who
declined
to
be
named
lured
by
world
class
geology
shrinking
reserves
elsewhere
and
rising
oil
prices
companies
have
dropped
big
money
on
brazil
latin
america
s
top
oil
producer
to
lock
in
stakes
to
its
layer
where
billions
of
barrels
of
oil
are
trapped
under
a
thick
layer
of
salt
offshore
china
s
cnooc
chevron
corp
bp
norway
s
equinor
and
france
s
total
are
also
all
registered
to
participate
in
the
auction
their
interest
has
been
fanned
by
policies
under
president
michel
temer
including
a
loosening
of
rules
that
had
favored
local
suppliers
an
extension
of
tax
sweeteners
and
the
removal
of
a
requirement
that
state
oil
giant
petrobras
be
sole
operator
in
blocks
fears
of
a
rollback
of
such
policies
should
encourage
big
bets
on
friday
according
to
edmar
almeida
an
energy
professor
at
the
federal
university
of
rio
de
janeiro
it
will
be
a
hotly
contested
auction
he
said
presidential
frontrunner
jair
bolsonaro
has
said
little
about
the
oil
sector
although
as
a
congressman
he
once
voted
against
easing
petrobras
oil
monopoly
he
has
floated
the
idea
of
privatizing
petrobras
and
has
indicated
that
he
will
champion
a
approach
if
he
wins
however
opinion
polls
indicate
that
a
likely
vote
on
would
be
a
close
contest
fernando
haddad
a
leftist
academic
who
has
climbed
into
the
no
spot
after
an
endorsement
from
jailed
former
president
luiz
inacio
lula
da
silva
has
a
much
more
nationalistic
view
of
the
industry
vowing
to
recover
the
to
serve
the
future
of
the
brazilian
people
not
the
interests
of
international
companies
according
to
his
platform
he
would
restore
stricter
requirements
for
using
local
suppliers
it
is
unclear
if
haddad
would
also
adopt
lula
s
pledge
to
revert
to
giving
petrobras
the
sole
right
to
operate
fields
and
slow
the
pace
of
auctions
ciro
gomes
a
leftist
former
state
governor
in
third
place
has
threatened
to
freeze
auctions
and
expropriate
blocks
already
handed
out
if
haddad
or
gomes
win
we
can
say
goodbye
to
auctions
said
another
oil
industry
executive
who
asked
not
be
named
they
want
to
renationalize
everything
it
will
be
hell
he
said
the
fiercest
bids
this
week
are
expected
to
be
for
the
tita
and
saturno
blocks
in
the
santos
basin
which
were
withdrawn
by
a
court
from
a
prior
auction
in
march
disappointing
exxon
both
pau
brasil
in
the
santos
basin
and
the
southwest
of
tartaruga
verde
in
the
campos
basin
received
no
bids
in
an
auction
last
year
but
this
time
petrobras
exercised
its
right
of
first
refusal
to
bid
for
the
tartaruga
verde
block
adjacent
to
an
area
it
already
owns
under
brazilian
rules
petrobras
can
express
advance
interest
in
operating
a
block
where
it
would
control
at
least
a
percent
stake
though
it
can
still
bid
on
other
blocks
on
the
day
of
the
auction
companies
will
compete
by
pledging
the
greatest
share
of
oil
subtracting
overhead
costs
to
the
government
with
minimums
ranging
from
percent
to
percent
