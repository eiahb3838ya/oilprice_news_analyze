column-tight or well-supplied? the crude oil market dilemma: russell
singapore
reuters
somebody
is
going
to
be
wrong
on
the
outlook
for
the
crude
oil
price
as
the
market
can
not
be
and
increasingly
tight
at
the
same
time
the
message
from
saudi
arabia
the
biggest
producer
in
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
its
ally
russia
is
that
there
is
no
need
for
extra
crude
in
the
market
however
the
word
from
traders
and
refiners
at
the
industry
s
annual
gathering
in
singapore
this
week
is
that
the
market
starting
to
look
short
of
necessary
barrels
and
prices
are
likely
to
head
higher
certainly
the
recent
rise
in
prices
for
oil
benchmarks
such
as
brent
seem
to
support
the
view
that
the
market
is
tightening
brent
traded
as
high
as
a
barrel
in
asia
on
monday
within
spitting
distance
of
the
intraday
peak
for
the
year
on
may
and
if
it
closes
above
it
will
the
first
time
this
has
happened
since
november
but
the
rise
in
prices
doesn
t
seem
to
be
an
issue
for
saudi
arabia
with
energy
minister
khalid
saying
after
a
meeting
of
opec
and
its
allies
in
algiers
at
the
weekend
that
there
was
no
plan
to
boost
output
even
though
they
could
if
needed
the
markets
are
adequately
supplied
i
don
t
know
of
any
refiner
in
the
world
who
is
looking
for
oil
and
is
not
able
to
get
it
falih
told
reporters
after
the
meeting
while
refiners
may
be
able
to
get
crude
oil
they
are
having
to
pay
more
for
it
and
deal
with
mounting
disruptions
to
normal
supply
chains
the
decision
to
sanctions
on
iran
is
already
forcing
refiners
to
look
elsewhere
for
supplies
of
the
heavy
sour
crudes
supplied
by
the
islamic
republic
the
situation
may
worsen
in
the
months
following
november
when
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
imposes
sanctions
on
all
iranian
exports
while
iran
is
unlikely
to
see
a
drop
to
zero
exports
initial
assessments
by
several
analysts
that
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
iranian
oil
would
be
lost
appear
way
too
optimistic
now
it
s
possible
that
iranian
exports
may
drop
by
more
than
million
bpd
and
possibly
even
as
high
as
million
bpd
as
major
customers
with
the
possible
exception
of
china
switch
to
alternatives
add
to
this
the
loss
of
venezuelan
oil
because
of
mounting
economic
and
political
problems
and
ongoing
disruptions
in
libya
and
suddenly
the
market
doesn
t
look
that
any
more
a
further
complicating
factor
is
the
trade
dispute
with
china
which
is
likely
to
result
in
chinese
refiners
buying
less
crude
from
the
united
states
disrupting
what
had
become
a
significant
trade
flow
while
it
s
possible
that
refiners
around
the
world
will
be
able
to
juggle
their
supplies
to
work
around
the
disruptions
this
is
likely
to
come
at
a
cost
as
always
quantifying
that
cost
is
difficult
but
the
of
oil
trading
at
trafigura
ben
luckock
on
monday
told
the
asia
pacific
petroleum
conference
hosted
by
s
p
global
platts
that
a
price
of
a
barrel
by
christmas
and
by
new
year
was
possible
crude
oil
price
curves
are
currently
in
backwardation
with
contracts
more
expensive
that
futures
backwardation
is
normally
a
sign
of
a
tight
market
as
traders
and
consumers
are
prepared
to
pay
more
in
order
to
assure
supplies
in
the
near
term
but
if
prices
really
are
expected
to
rise
sharply
in
the
coming
months
on
the
back
of
the
sanctions
against
iran
it
may
make
sense
to
buy
oil
at
the
current
prices
looking
at
prices
that
more
closely
track
iranian
crude
such
as
oman
futures
on
the
dubai
mercantile
exchange
and
physical
dubai
swaps
and
some
interesting
trends
emerge
the
oman
forward
curve
has
seen
backwardation
steepen
in
the
past
month
with
the
contract
now
at
a
premium
of
to
the
future
up
from
a
month
ago
however
comparing
the
paper
oman
contract
to
physical
dubai
shows
that
the
forward
curve
for
the
physical
market
is
not
as
steeply
backwardated
currently
dubai
swaps
for
november
are
at
a
barrel
a
premium
of
to
the
april
contract
what
may
be
happening
is
that
physical
oil
consumers
such
as
refiners
are
locking
in
supplies
further
along
the
curve
in
anticipation
of
price
rises
while
the
of
the
paper
markets
are
being
driven
higher
by
investor
flows
seeking
to
take
advantage
of
increasing
media
coverage
of
a
tighter
market
but
once
the
sanctions
on
iran
take
full
effect
it
will
become
clearer
whether
the
saudis
are
correct
that
the
market
is
or
whether
the
traders
have
picked
a
winner
in
tipping
higher
prices
