world
oil
demand
will
peak
at
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
the
up
from
just
below
million
bpd
currently
as
new
technologies
gradually
eat
into
oil
use
china
s
unipec
said
on
monday
improved
energy
efficiency
and
technological
changes
including
the
rise
of
renewables
meant
global
oil
demand
growth
would
slow
in
coming
years
before
peaking
in
unipec
president
chen
bo
told
the
annual
asia
pacific
petroleum
conference
appec
this
in
turn
will
slow
growth
in
global
oil
refining
capacity
which
is
set
to
hit
billion
tonnes
per
year
in
he
said
we
believe
will
be
the
last
cycle
of
global
refining
capacity
expansion
after
it
is
difficult
to
see
refining
projects
in
construction
except
for
some
small
upgrade
projects
and
petrochemical
projects
said
chen
unipec
is
the
trading
arm
of
asia
s
largest
refiner
sinopec
the
switch
to
cleaner
fuels
will
also
boost
global
demand
for
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
particularly
in
the
asia
pacific
after
he
added
an
escalating
trade
war
between
china
the
largest
energy
importer
and
the
united
states
has
dampened
the
asian
nation
s
demand
for
crude
oil
and
lng
the
united
states
exported
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
oil
to
china
in
the
first
half
of
and
cargoes
of
lng
through
july
or
roughly
percent
of
its
total
lng
exports
according
to
official
data
despite
the
trade
dispute
chen
said
crude
supply
was
an
important
new
source
for
chinese
refiners
as
it
allowed
diversification
from
middle
east
and
african
crudes
trade
war
tensions
between
the
two
countries
would
last
for
the
time
being
and
in
the
future
we
ll
be
active
in
this
area
he
added
beijing
has
excluded
crude
imports
from
its
tariffs
list
so
far
but
most
chinese
buyers
are
staying
away
from
oil
as
the
trade
war
shows
no
signs
of
cooling
unipec
resumed
loading
crude
in
september
after
a
hiatus
china
is
also
under
pressure
from
the
united
states
to
reduce
its
iranian
oil
imports
as
washington
aims
to
cut
exports
from
opec
s
exporter
to
zero
to
force
tehran
to
negotiate
a
nuclear
treaty
buyers
in
europe
japan
south
korea
and
india
have
either
stopped
or
are
reducing
iranian
oil
imports
sharply
ahead
of
the
introduction
of
sanctions
in
november
i
expect
we
ll
cut
a
little
but
the
volume
has
not
been
finalised
chen
said
without
giving
a
timeframe
for
the
cuts
he
added
that
unipec
has
resumed
normal
loadings
of
saudi
oil
after
it
cut
imports
in
given
the
current
supply
and
demand
dynamic
in
global
markets
chen
said
crude
oil
prices
between
at
and
per
barrel
were
normal
