for
workers
on
offshore
oil
and
gas
drilling
rigs
stepped
up
a
strike

not
respond

demands
for
higher
wages
and
pension
benefits
the
union
is
adding
workers
to
the
strike
under
a
plan
announced
last

win
concessions
before
a
midnight
gmt
deadline
since
almost
workers
on
the
rigs
went
on
strike
on
tuesday
the
expanded
strike
will
not
have
any
immediate
extra
impact
on
oil
or
gas
production
beyond
the
closure
last
week
of
shell
s
knarr
field
which
produces
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
both
the
safe
union

shipowners
association
said

on
sunday
they
had
no
contacts
or
new
offers
during
the
weekend
the
websites
of
both
sides
which
they
said
would
notify
workers
of
any
breakthroughs
had
no
updates
as
the
deadline
passed
the
escalation
takes
place
from
midnight
as
planned
safe
union
spokesman
roy
aleksandersen
said
just
before
deadline
the
workers
on
the
offshore
oil
