u.s. oil boom delivers surprise for traders - and it's costly
york
reuters
the
world
s
biggest
oil
traders
are
counting
hefty
losses
after
a
surprise
doubling
in
the
price
discount
of
light
crude
to
benchmark
brent
in
just
a
month
as
surging
production
upends
the
market
trading
desks
of
oil
major
bp
and
merchants
vitol
gunvor
and
trafigura
have
recorded
losses
in
the
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
each
as
a
result
of
the
whipsaw
move
when
the
spread
reached
more
than
a
barrel
in
june
insiders
familiar
with
their
performance
told
reuters
the
sources
did
not
give
precise
figures
for
the
losses
but
they
said
they
were
enough
for
gunvor
and
bp
to
fire
at
least
one
trader
each
the
companies
declined
to
comment
and
none
of
them
publish
details
of
their
individual
trading
books
it
highlights
the
challenges
of
trading
in
wti
futures
the
benchmark
for
crude
when
pipeline
and
storage
infrastructure
struggles
to
keep
pace
with
surging
shale
output
that
has
lifted
the
united
states
above
saudi
arabia
to
become
the
world
s
second
biggest
crude
producer
behind
russia
as
the
exporter
of
crude
traders
are
naturally
long
wti
and
hedge
their
bets
by
shorting
brent
when
the
spreads
widen
so
wildly
you
lose
money
said
a
top
executive
with
one
of
the
four
trading
firms
the
discount
of
wti
to
brent
hit
a
barrel
on
june
the
widest
in
more
than
three
years
as
output
surged
to
record
highs
and
surpassed
pipeline
capacity
as
traders
rushed
to
export
the
discount
had
been
about
just
a
month
before
betting
on
the
price
spread
a
popular
trade
in
oil
markets
is
based
on
predictions
of
price
differences
between
european
and
market
fundamentals

click
the
jump
in
output
now
almost
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
from
below
million
bpd
a
decade
ago
has
upended
the
spread
until
crude
mostly
traded
at
a
premium
to
brent
but
the
growing
availability
of
crude
has
meant
that
it
has
almost
always
been
at
a
discount
since
then
however
it
is
the
big
sudden
moves
that
tend
to
claim
trade
casualties
sometimes
earning
the
moniker
widowmaker
since
the
june
spike
the
spread
has
narrowed
sharply
again
the
shrinking
discount
was
helped
by
a
rise
in
the
price
of
wti
due
to
an
unexpected
outage
at
the
syncrude
oil
sands
site
in
canada
which
can
produce
up
to
bpd
due
to
the
canadian
outage
inventories
last
week
at
the
cushing
delivery
point
for
crude
futures
fell
to
their
lowest
since
december
data
showed
volatility
in
the
spread
has
been
just
one
of
several
trading
hazards
that
emerged
in
the
first
quarter
of
traders
have
also
had
to
pay
heavy
premiums
to
exit
storage
leases
as
the
oil
price
structure
flipped
to
backwardation
when
prices
are
higher
than
those
for
later
delivery
making
it
unprofitable
to
store
crude
climbing
output
has
put
strains
on
the
pipeline
network
particularly
in
the
permian
basin
in
texas
which
has
been
the
biggest
contributor
to
the
production
surge
a
bottleneck
that
hit
crude
for
delivery
in
midland
texas
caught
bp
off
guard
and
led
to
losses
when
the
discount
to
wti
shifted
sharply
during
april
to
june
according
to
four
market
sources
and
one
source
close
to
bp
in
late
april
the
discount
was
close
to
a
barrel
before
widening
to
as
much
as
on
may
this
was
followed
by
a
sharp
bounce
back
to
around
in
the
second
half
of
may
followed
by
a
similar
move
in
june
three
bp
traders
took
the
heat
for
losses
related
to
the
midland
rollercoaster
the
source
close
to
bp
said
one
was
sacked
and
two
others
were
reshuffled
