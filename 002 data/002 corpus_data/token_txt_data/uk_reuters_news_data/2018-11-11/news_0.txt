engie
brasil
energia
is
negotiating
the
contracts
on
the
free

that
would
allow
it
to
build
new

without
going

its
cfo

freitas
told
reuters
in
an
interview
we
are
already
closing
contracts
and
aim
to
reach
a
critical
mass
that
will
make
the
investment
viable
freitas
said
we
hope
to
make
an
announcement
fierce
competition
in
brazil
s
regulated
energy
market
depressed
wind
power
contracts
last
year
to
record
lows
of

contracts
can
be
signed

according
to
the
bbce
electronic
trading
platform
the
prices
from
the
auctions
on
the
regulated

are
not
attractive
for
us
so
we
prefer
to
focus
on
the
free
market
where
we
are
have
the
advantage
of
being
the
biggest
player
in
brazil
freitas
said
large
wind
farms
that
engie
is
building
already
allow
economies
of
scale
that
bring
down
costs
but
require
heavy
investments

said
the

farm
complex
in
the
brazilian
state
of
bahia
which
has
percent
of
its
future
energy
output
already
sold
on
the
free
market
involves
investment
budgeted
at
billion
reais
phase
of
the
campo
largo
complex
also
in

will
cost
billion

with
