oil pucks and pellets; canada eyes new ways to move stranded crude
calgary

reuters
canada
s
biggest
railroad
says
it
is
attracting
interest
from
oil
producers
in
its
effort
to
move
crude
in
solid
form
as
clogged
pipelines
divert
more
oil
to
riskier
rail
transport
congested
pipelines
have
stranded
much
of
canada
s
crude
in
alberta
driving
discounts
to
levels
canadian
heavy
crude
traded
on
friday
for
less
than
of
the
benchmark
light
oil
price
the
latest
blow
to
the
sector
landed
on
thursday
when
a
court
ruled
construction
must
stop
on
transcanada
corp
s
keystone
xl
pipeline
pipeline
pressure
has
pushed
more
crude
onto
trains
owned
by
canadian
national
railway
co
and
smaller
rival
canadian
pacific
railway
limited
but
crude
movement
by
rail
is
costly
and
prone
to
spills
and
sometimes
disastrous
accidents
such
as
the
derailment
at
lac
megantic
quebec
that
killed
dozens
of
people
enter
cn
s
patented
canapux
product
which
is
solidified
crude
encased
in
plastic
named
to
evoke
the
country
s
most
popular
sport
hockey
the
railroad
argues
that
solid
crude
never
before
commercially
shipped
in
the
world
can
be
transported
more
cheaply
efficiently
and
with
less
environmental
risk
than
liquid
crude
in
tank
cars
since
it
floats
canapux
is
easier
to
recover
from
a
spill
into
a
water
body
interest
from
crude
producers
buyers
and
transport
companies
picked
up
after
a
canadian
court
in
august
overturned
ottawa
s
approval
for
the
trans
mountain
oil
pipeline
expansion
said
james
cairns
cn
s
of
petroleum
and
chemicals
there
have
been
a
lot
more
discussions
about
how
do
we
get
this
done
cairns
said
conversations
are
much
more
advanced
than
they
cn
is
seeking
commercial
partners
to
build
a
pilot
plant
that
will
process
barrels
per
day
of
undiluted
heavy
crude
into
canapux
the
plant
to
be
built
either
at
the
alberta
crude
storage
hub
around
edmonton
or
on
an
oil
producer
s
site
is
estimated
to
cost
less
than
c
million
million
it
could
be
running
as
soon
as
cairns
said
cn
s
oil
pucks
would
move
in
gondola
cars
which
weigh
less
than
tank
cars
allowing
the
railroad
to
load
them
with
more
crude
they
also
do
not
require
diluent
an
oil
that
is
mixed
with
crude
when
it
is
shipped
in
liquid
form
by
rail
or
pipeline
as
a
result
canapux
shipping
costs
would
knock
off
nearly
half
the
expense
of
rail
transportation
in
liquid
form
according
to
cn
other
entrepreneurs
have
pursued
similar
ideas
for
several
years
from
blobs
to
pellets
alberta
inventor
cal
broder
said
two
refineries
in
china
are
interested
in
his
bitcrude
product
which
he
intends
to
produce
from
bitumen
he
plans
a
test
shipment
of
several
containers
of
his
crude
to
asia
before
both
bitcrude
and
canapux
still
require
government
regulatory
approvals
success
of
either
product
also
hinges
on
convincing
oil
refineries
to
make
changes
needed
to
convert
solid
crude
back
to
liquid
for
processing
but
the
idea
of
shipping
crude
in
solid
form
is
compelling
said
alex
pourbaix
chief
executive
of
cenovus
energy
a
major
canadian
shipper
of
crude
by
rail
i
am
quite
intrigued
by
those
technologies
he
said
in
an
interview
we
re
going
to
make
sure
we
take
a
hard
look
at
them
