video
on
social
media
of
people
filling
buckets
from
the
pipeline
during
daylight
hours
in
the
presence
of
the
armed
forces
prompting
questions
about
why
authorities
had
not
acted
the
government
said
soldiers
reached
the
scene
after
pemex
detected
the
illegal
tap
but
could
not
secure
the
area
in
time
at
some
point
there
were
too
many
people
there
and
the
army
and
military
personnel
withdrew
to
avoid
problems
public

told

just
as
they
were
withdrawing
that
the

had
registered
the
charred

others
had
been

he
said
the
death
toll
could
still
rise
as
authorities
reviewed
the
site
lopez
obrador
says
his
shutdown
greatly
reduced
theft
but
it
sparked
fears
for
the
economy
as
well
as
triggering
shortfalls
in
central
mexico
including
hidalgo
soon
after
the
government
said
friday
s
blaze
had
been
put
out
tv
footage
showed
tense
exchanges
between
authorities
guarding
the
site
and
residents
arguing
that
the
death
toll
was
significantly
higher
than
the
damage
also
raised
the
prospect
of
a
new
setback
in
the
government
s
bid
to
restore
fuel
supply
pemex
chief
executive
officer
octavio
romero
said
the
ruptured
pipeline
which
durazo
said
early
findings
suggested
had
been
tapped
before
was
vital
to
transporting
an
additive
needed
for
gasoline
