china
is
unlikely
to
see
a
repeat
surge
in
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
imports
this
coming
winter
as
the
world
s
largest
energy
consumer
has
learned
from
the
previous
cold
season
to
keep
demand
under
control
the
head
of
unipec
said
on
tuesday
last
year
was
a
special
year
chen
bo
president
of
unipec
the
trading
arm
of
china
petroleum
chemical
corp
or
sinopec
told
delegates
at
the
lng
forum
in
singapore
referring
to
government
policies
that
caused
china
s
lng
imports
and
prices
in
asia
to
soar
last
winter
china
overtook
south
korea
as
the
world
s
lng
importer
in
with
imports
of
million
tonnes
percent
higher
than
a
year
ago
the
imports
soared
after
the
government
ordered
millions
of
homes
to
switch
to
natural
gas
and
electric
heating
from
coal
to
counter
rising
air
pollution
we
didn
t
have
the
experience
before
to
deal
with
such
a
situation
chen
said
this
year
demand
will
increase
but
the
government
and
companies
will
control
he
added
the
surge
in
gas
demand
caused
by
the
government
switching
policy
created
a
shortfall
in
supply
that
caused
interruptions
in
shipments
to
industrial
customers
as
gas
was
diverted
to
residential
users
chinese
companies
have
announced
plans
to
secure
more
gas
ahead
of
next
winter
sinopec
said
in
early
april
that
it
will
increase
its
natural
gas
supplies
significantly
in
the
next
six
years
and
also
plans
to
more
than
double
its
liquefied
natural
gas
receiving
capacity
in
the
next
six
years
to
million
tonnes
on
an
annual
basis
petrochina

chen
said
he
sees
sufficient
lng
supplies
in
the
market
and
unipec
has
the
flexibility
to
source
supply
from
various
countries
for
example
we
can
get
supplies
from
the
qatar
expansion
increase
supplies
from
australia
plus
there
is
fantastic
supplies
from
