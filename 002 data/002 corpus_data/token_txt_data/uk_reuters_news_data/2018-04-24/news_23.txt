poland
s
plan
to
improve
air
quality
and
switch
to
electric
vehicles
could
be
financed
with
help
from
the
european
bank
for
reconstruction
and
development
a
top
ebrd
official
said
poland
aims
to
have
million
electric
cars
on
its
roads
by
as
it
seeks
to
cut
emissions
in
its
most
polluted
towns
it
has
offered
tax
and
other
incentives
to
make
electric
cars
more
accessible
and
is
working
on
a
polish
electric

prototype

activist
group
polski
alarm
smogowy
says
cities
such
as
warsaw
katowice
and
krakow
are
among
the
dirtiest
in
europe
we
will
be
delighted
to
support
projects
going
towards
electromobility
both
in
terms
of
public
transport
and
other
projects
that
could
lead
to
the
development
of
this
sector
grzegorz
zielinski
ebrd
s
poland
chief
told
reuters
he
said
the
ebrd
could
for
example
help
finance
the
use
of
electric
buses
rather
than
diesel
ones
in
some
polish
towns
poland
which
is
highly
dependent
on
coal
has
not
yet
requested
the
money
nor
specified
how
much
it
is
budgeting
for
spending
on
the
project
helping
poland
become
cleaner
is
one
of
the
key
elements
of
ebrd
s
new
country
strategy
approved
earlier
this
month
zielinski
also
said
ebrd
was
ready
to
provide
financing
for
poland
s
first
offshore
wind
farms
the
two
most
advanced
projects
are
developed
by
utility
pge
and
polenergia
controlled
by
the
kulczyk
family
one
of
the
richest
in
poland
ebrd
has
helped
financed
many
onshore
wind
farms
in
poland
in
the
past
but
has
criticised
government
policies
which
have
made
them
unprofitable
in
the
government
unexpectedly
banned
building
wind
farms
too
close
to
dwellings
and
imposed
a
higher
property
tax
on
wind
farm
owners
in
its
most
recent
proposal
it
has
withdrawn
from
the
tax
though
zielinski
said
that
these
regulatory
changes
for
renewables
were
one
of
the
reasons
why
many
foreign
investors
have
put
on
hold
their
investment
decisions
in
poland
the
ruling
law
and
justice
party
pis
used
to
say
that
coal
would
remain
poland
s
dominant
source
of
energy
for
many
years
and
saw
renewable
energy
as
unstable
but
more
recently
it
has
suggested
poland
needs
cleaner
sources
of
energy
including
nuclear
power
and
offshore
wind
farms
to
reduce
emissions
and
meet
eu
targets
ebrd
sees
its
annual
investment
in
poland
in
the
coming
years
similar
to
previous
years
it
spent
million
euros
in
and
