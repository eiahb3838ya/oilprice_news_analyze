refiner
jxtg

on

said
that
tsutomu
sugimori
head
of
its
downstream
refining
unit
would
become
the
company
s
next
president
current

holdings
president
yukio
uchida
is
to
become
chairman
the
company
said
in
a
statement
with
the
changes
taking
effect
following
an
annual
shareholders
meeting
in
late
june
faced
with
a
continued
decline
in
domestic
oil
demand
one
of
the
company
s
top
challenges
is
to
balance
its
million
barrels
per
day
worth
of
refining
capacity
with
demand
sugimori
said
following
a
media
briefing
that
there
had
been
some
progress
in
compiling
plans
for
consolidating
the
company
s
domestic
refineries
and
other
plants
but
added
that
the
steps
would
likely
be
announced
one
by
one
he
added
that
it
was
possible
such
announcements
could
come
this
year
downstream
refining
unit
jxtg
nippon
oil
energy
corp
recently
struck
a
deal
with
vietnam
national
petroleum
group
petrolimex
to
work
on
a
feasibility
study
to
jxtg
s
marifu
refinery
sugimori
said
petrolimex
wants
its
own
refinery
because
of
a
lack
of
supply
capacity
in
vietnam
where
demand
is
growing
rapidly
the
study
into
exporting
oil
products
from
marifu
came
after
petrolimex
and
jxtg
concluded
that
for
now
it
would
be
difficult
to
build
a
new
refinery
in
vietnam
he
said
if
the
marifu
refinery
became
a
venture
half
of
the
refinery
would
belong
to
petrolimex
with
half
of
volumes
exported
and
that
would
help
us
to
reduce
our
supply
capacity
as
well
he
told
reporters
asked
whether
if
it
makes
economic
sense
for
vietnam
to
import
oil
products
from
japan
he
said
that
there
is
a
tariff
barrier
which
would
need
to
be
taken
into
account
