papua
new
guinea
s
main
source
of
foreign
revenue
fiscal
pressures
were
already
high
as
a
result
of
the
collapse
in
oil
prices
to
a
barrel
in
early
gas
prices
are
closely
linked
to
oil
crude
markets
have
since
recovered
breaking
above
a
barrel
for
the
first
time
in
nearly

on

that
will
help
make
up
the
revenue
shortfall
sustained
because
of
the
devastating
quake
o
neill
said
it
certainly
will
affect
the
last
couple
of
months
we
received
no
revenue
because
of
the
earthquake
he
added
o
neill
who
stayed

stood
at
percent

of
which
almost
are
domestic

the
premier
said
in
terms
of
our
debt
management
we
are
comfortable
said
o
neill
adding
his
country
had
no
plans
to
talk
to
the
international
monetary
fund
about
assistance
but
recent
pressures
have
cast
a
shadow
over
the
economic
and
fiscal
outlook
earlier
this
year
ratings

s
p
global
lowered
the
pacific
island
nation
s
credit

both
cited
a

profile
lower

lng
project
o
neill
said
there
were
plans

lng
trains
to
the
existing
two
and
details
would
be
announced
before
november
s
economic
cooperation
meeting
apart
from
natural
gas
the
country
can
also
earn
foreign
export
revenue
from
mining
although
its
panguna
mine
on
the
island
of
bougainville
once
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
copper
mines
has
been
shut
since
a
civil
war
in
bougainville
copper
has
been
working
to
restart
the
mine
and
has
contested
a
decision
by
the
bougainville
government
to
impose
an
indefinite
moratorium
the
constitution
and
the
overall
legislation
from
the
federal
national
government
is
the
one
that
underpins
all
the
other
legislation
it
s
subject
to
the
main
laws
the
prime
minister
said
when
asked
about
the
moratorium
he
declined
to
predict
the
outcome
of
court
deliberations
papua
new
guinea
also
hit
the
headlines
over
environmental
protests
because
of
plans
by
nautilus
minerals
to
mine
the
ocean
floor
we
are
reviewing
some
of
the
environmental
issues
we
will
continue
to
engage
with
nautilus
to
see
how
we
can
mitigate
