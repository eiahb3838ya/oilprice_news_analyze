china
s
surging
imports
of
crude
oil
this
year
are
the
major
driver
of
higher
prices
on
the
demand
side
but
the
flip
side
to
this
is
soaring
chinese
fuel
exports
that
are
hurting
profit
margins
at
regional
refiners
the
world
s
largest
crude
importer
took
in
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
the
first
quarter
up
percent
from
the
same
period
in
according
to
customs
data
exports
of
refined
products
however
have
jumped
by
even
larger
margins
with
shipments
of
gasoline
and
diesel
reaching
record
highs
in
march
according
to
the
data
released
on
monday
gasoline
exports
were
million
tonnes
in
march
or
about
double
what
they
were
in
the
same
month
last
year
in
the
first
quarter
china
shipped
million
tonnes
of
gasoline
or
about
bpd
and
some
percent
above
the
bpd
exported
in
the
same
period
of
diesel
exports
were
million
tonnes
in
march
equivalent
to
about
bpd
with
shipments
around
bpd
in
the
first
quarter
a
gain
of
some
percent
on
the
period
taking
all
oil
products
together
shows
that
china
s
exports
in
the
first
quarter
were
million
bpd
up
almost
percent
on
million
bpd
shipped
in
the
same
period
last
year
looking
at
crude
import
numbers
along
with
the
product
exports
shows
that
of
the
additional
bpd
of
crude
oil
imported
in
the
first
quarter
about
bpd
was
exported
as
additional
refined
fuels
it
appears
that
this
rising
supply
of
oil
products
from
china
has
weighed
somewhat
on
regional
prices
especially
in
gasoline
which
has
witnessed
the
biggest
increase
in
exports
from
china
the
profit
margin
or
crack
on
producing
a
barrel
of
gasoline
from
brent
crude
in
singapore
the
regional
benchmark
slumped
to
the
lowest
in
months
on
april
hitting
a
barrel
it
has
since
recovered
somewhat
to
a
barrel
as
of
monday
but
it
s
still
almost
percent
below
the
recent
peak
of
reached
in
august
last
year
diesel
has
fared
better
with
the
profit
margin
in
singapore
for
a
barrel
of
gasoil
the
term
for
diesel
before
retail
additives
are
added
ending
at
on
monday
this
is
slightly
higher
than
the
a
barrel
at
the
end
of
last
year
and
also
up
from
the
low
so
far
this
year
of
reached
in
early
march
the
difference
between
the
gasoline
and
diesel
markets
this
year
is
that
the
region
has
had
to
absorb
a
sharp
increase
in
chinese
gasoline
exports
but
not
so
much
of
diesel
and
now
product
prices
are
still
high
enough
to
prompt
chinese
refiners
to
export
refined
fuels
the
ability
of
china
s
refiners
to
export
fuels
has
been
aided
by
the
higher
crude
import
quotas
granted
this
year
to
smaller
independent
refiners
by
the
authorities
in
beijing
there
may
be
some
temporary
relief
for
the
region
s
other
exporters
of
refined
fuels
such
as
singapore
south
korea
japan
and
india
as
some
chinese
plants
enter
scheduled
maintenance
this
should
lower
the
processing
rate
at
chinese
refineries
which
hit
a
record
million
bpd
in
march
above
the
previous
high
of
million
bpd
in
november
what
is
becoming
increasingly
clear
though
is
that
china
is
emerging
as
a
major
player
in
the
markets
for
refined
fuels
in
asia
especially
since
the
authorities
seem
ready
to
allow
refiners
to
import
more
crude
and
export
surplus
products
