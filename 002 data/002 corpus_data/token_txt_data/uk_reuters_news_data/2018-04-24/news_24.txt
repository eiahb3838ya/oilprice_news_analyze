the
slump
that
characterised
the
oil
market
between
the
middle
of
and
the
middle

has
been
replaced
by
what
looks
like
the
beginning
of
a

benchmark
brent
prices
have
already
risen
by
more
than
per

or

from
their
cyclical
trough
in

prices
at
almost
per

are
now
trading
close
to
the
average
for
the
last
price
cycle
which
started
in
and
finished
in
so

this
year
futures
prices

which
is
well
above
the
real
average
price
of
futures
prices
have
shifted
from
a
big
contango
during
the
slump
into
an
increasingly
wide
backwardation
since
the

global
oil
consumption
is
predicted
to
increase
by
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
the
fourth
consecutive
year
of
very
strong
growth
oil
production
is
forecast
to
increase
by
million
bpd
or
more
this
year
mostly
as
a
result
of
a
large
increase
in
shale
plus
other
output
increases
from
canada
brazil
and
norway
but
with
steep
declines
in
output
from
opec
member
venezuela
as
a
result
of
unrest
and
mismanagement
and
continued
curbs
on
production
by
other
opec
and
members
global
production
is
failing
to
keep
pace
with
consumption
oecd
inventories
have
dropped
sharply
and
are
now
in
line
with
the
average
eliminating
the
surplus
of
over
million
barrels
inherited
from
the
slump
if
inventories
are
adjusted
for
the
rise
in
consumption
which
gives
a
more
accurate
picture
of
the
market
balance
stocks
are
now
well
below
the
average
and
continue
to
tighten
so
on
every
indicator
from
spot
prices
and
spreads
to
consumption
production
and
inventories
the
oil
market
is
now
well
into
the
boom
phase
of
the
cycle
but
booms
are
always
followed
by
slumps
if
opec
allows
the
oil
market
to
tighten
too
much
in
it
will
create
the
conditions
for
the
next
downturn
a
few
years
later
senior
opec
officials
insist
the
organisation
s
work
on
rebalancing
the
market
has
not
yet
been
completed
and
they
resist
the
characterisation
of
mission
accomplished
in
particular
they
point
to
the
relatively
low
level
of
investment
in
exploration
and
production
to
justify
the
need
for
continued
production
curbs
and
even
higher
prices
but
investment
is
a
lagging
indicator
investment
was
slow
to
pick
up
during
the
early
stages
of
the
last
boom
then
proved
stubbornly
resilient
in
the
first
stages
of
the
slump
lagging
upstream
investment
is
one
of
the
principal
causes
of
cyclical
instability
in
the
oil
market
and
has
been
since
the
beginning
of
the
modern
petroleum
industry
if
opec
members
wait
for
an
acceleration
of
upstream
investment
before
relaxing
their
production
curbs
as
ministers
have
indicated
they
will
almost
certainly
the
market
in
the
meantime
the
oil
market
is
already
tight
and
the
increasingly
wide
backwardation
indicates
traders
expect
it
to
become
even
tighter
during
the
second
half
of
the
year
when
oil
consumption
moves
seasonally
higher
if
opec
maintains
its
current
output
curbs
through
december
the
market
is
set
to
become
exceptionally
tight
which
will
push
prices
and
spreads
towards
unstable
levels
the
resulting
increase
in
prices
and
spreads
will
accelerate
production
growth
even
further
and
start
to
restrain
consumption
growth
opec
ministers
profess
to
be
unconcerned
about
the
impact
on
either
supply
or
demand
but
they
have
often
misjudged
market
responses
in
the
past
the
number
of
rigs
drilling
for
oil
in
the
united
states
has
already
resumed
its
upward
trend
over
the
last
three
weeks
in
response
to
higher
prices
which
will
increase
shale
output
even
further
by
the
end
of
consumption
changes
are
harder
to
measure
in
and
tend
to
lag
behind
changes
in
oil
prices
but
the
rise
in
prices
will
restrain
demand
too
as
it
has
always
done
during
every
previous
period
of
rising
prices
opec
members
deny
that
they
are
principally
responsible
for
the
increase
in
oil
prices
over
the
last
year
or
that
they
should
adjust
their
production
policy
in
response
they
can
point
to
unplanned
outages
in
venezuela
and
other
producing
nations
as
well
as
unexpectedly
strong
demand
from
consumers
for
drawing
down
inventories
faster
than
they
predicted
at
the
end
of
last
year
they
can
also
point
to
growing
concern
among
traders
about
the
imposition
of
sanctions
on
venezuela
and
of
sanctions
on
iran
for
accelerating
price
increases
all
these
arguments
are
true
and
all
these
factors
are
outside
opec
s
control
but
production
policy
is
something
opec
controls
directly
and
for
which
it
is
responsible
opec
s
current
production
levels
were
set
back
in
november
when
the
market
was
heavily
oversupplied
inventories
were
rising
and
prices
had
only
risen
modestly
from
cyclical
lows
what
was
appropriate
then
is
arguably
no
longer
appropriate
now
if
opec
members
decide
to
extend
current
levels
through
to
the
they
will
probably
be
held
responsible
for
the
price
increase
likely
to
follow
president
donald
trump
has
already
indicated
he
holds
opec
responsible
for
rising
oil
prices
via
a
message
on
his
twitter
account
if
oil
and
fuel
prices
continue
rising
the
political
pushback
from
consumer
countries
against
opec
will
only
intensify
but
what
should
concern
the
organisation
more
is
the
very
real
risk
that
further
price
increases
will
prove
by
the
market
in
opec
will
be
creating
conditions
for
the
next
cyclical
downturn
