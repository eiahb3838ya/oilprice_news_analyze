uerto
rico
battered
by
hurricane
maria
in
september
is
working
day
and
night
to
restore
public
services
but
a
row
with
washington
over
a
fiscal
turnaround
plan
for
the
bankrupt
territory
is
draining
energy
from
the
recovery
effort
said
the
caribbean
island
s
secretary
of
state
luis
rivera
marín
puerto
rico
s
official
said
the
territory
s
government
would
not
comply
with
some
of
the
measures
announced
by
the
federal
oversight
board
last
week
which
affect
public
policies
such
as
pensions
we
are
going
to
take
care
of
our
most
vulnerable
our
children
our
elderly
and
we
will
take
the
necessary
measures
so
that
through
tourism
and
technology
we
can
return
to
economic
growth
and
pay
our
debts
he
said
in
an
interview
on
the
sidelines
of
the
smart
island
world
congress
in
mallorca
last
year
puerto
rico
filed
the
biggest
government
bankruptcy
in
history
owing
billion
of
bonds
and
billion
in
pension
obligations
the
oversight
plan
forecasts
that
puerto
rico
would
be
able
to
pay
back
billion
through
governor
of
puerto
rico
ricardo
rosselló
said
in
a
statement
on
thursday
the
board
usurps
the
powers
of
the
democratically
elected
government
rivera
marín
a
former
commercial
lawyer
said
puerto
rico
s
government
agreed
with
about
percent
of
the
plan
but
would
disregard
the
rest
it
distracts
us
we
need
to
put
all
of
our
energy
in
the
rebuilding
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
ahead
of
the
start
of
the
hurricane
season
in
june
we
are
working
day
and
night
to
make
sure
the
last
home
on
the
island
gets
its
power
back
all
schools
are
reopened
hospitals
provide
proper
health
services
that
s
our
some
customers
have
been
without
power
since
hurricane
maria
took
out
the
island
s
electricity
supply
restoring
electricity
in
puerto
rico
which
suffered
its
latest
blackout
last
week
when
a
transmission
line
failure
cut
power
to
almost
all
million
residents
has
been
a
major
challenge
rivera
marín
said
the
puerto
rico
government
was
working
on
ways
to
avoid
the
same
thing
happening
in
future
storms
it
has
changed
the
law
for
example
to
allow
individuals
businesses
and
cooperatives
to
set
up
that
can
operate
independently
of
the
main
power
grid
if
needed
people
can
now
store
and
use
solar
power
they
produce
from
panels
installed
at
home
he
said
puerto
rico
aims
to
source
percent
of
its
energy
from
clean
sources
mainly
solar
and
wind
by
up
from
percent
now
rivera
marín
said
it
currently
relies
on
imported
diesel
for
percent
of
its
needs
which
is
costly
and
polluting
we
want
to
get
rid
of
diesel
altogether
rivera
marín
said
noting
the
aim
is
to
bring
the
cost
per
kilowatt
hour
of
electricity
down
from
to
less
than
by
it
would
help
hotels
the
fiscal
position
family
budgets
everyone
he
said
another
measure
to
deal
better
with
disasters
is
to
improve
data
collection
on
everything
from
logistics
to
hospitals
and
generator
sizes
in
partnership
with
businesses
and
using
blockchain
and
cloud
storage
he
added
puerto
rico
also
wants
to
turn
the
destruction
wrought
by
the
hurricane
into
an
opportunity
to
build
better
housing
for
its
people
rivera
marín
said
more
than
homes
were
damaged
or
destroyed
by
the
storm
many
of
them
wooden
shacks
with
tin
roofs
puerto
rico
where
percent
live
below
the
poverty
line
has
asked
washington
for
money
to
build
dignified
housing
that
can
better
withstand
storms
rivera
marín
said
so
far
billion
in
assistance
has
been
granted
by
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
for
disaster
recovery
in
puerto
rico
including
housing
the
island
s
economy
relies
heavily
on
manufacturing
for
the
pharmaceuticals
industry
which
was
disrupted
by
the
hurricane
after
the
storm
tens
of
thousands
of
puerto
ricans
left
for
the
mainland
and
some
have
yet
to
return
but
that
process
of
relocation
had
already
spiked
before
the
disaster
because
of
bad
economic
conditions
rivera
marín
said
there
has
been
a
brain
drain
he
said
the
island
s
government
is
stopping
the
bleeding
through
policies
such
as
lower
tax
rates
for
doctors
he
added
now
we
are
working
on
prosperity
on
making
puerto
rico
safe
making
a
place
where
your
children
can
get
a
good
education
where
you
can
find
a
good
job
or
build
a
small
business
for
yourself
