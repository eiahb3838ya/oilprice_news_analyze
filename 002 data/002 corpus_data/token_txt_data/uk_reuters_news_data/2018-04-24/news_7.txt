bp
chief
executive
bob
dudley
on
tuesday
urged
cambridge
university
not
to
yield
to
pressure
from
hundreds
of
students
and
academics
to
cut
its
investments
in
fossil
fuels
and
pointed
to
bp
s
donations
to
the
university
we
donate
and
do
a
lot
of
research
at
cambridge
so
i
hope
they
come
to
their
senses
dudley
told
the
aipn
international
petroleum
summit
bp
did
not
immediately
disclose
how
much
it
has
been
donating
to
the
university
in
it
gave
grants
worth
around
million
pounds
according
to
cambridge
and
in
a
million
pound
donation
from
bp
helped
to
create
the
bp
institute
for
multiphase
flow
which
focuses
on
research
in
surfaces
and
particles
and
fluid
dynamics
cambridge
said
the
university
council
will
publish
its
decision
on
whether
it
will
change
its
investments
after
years
of
campaigning
by
students
and
academics
after
a
meeting
next
month
a
spokesman
for
bp
said
after
dudley
s
comments
that
he
does
not
expect
the
group
s
relationship
with
cambridge
to
change
one
should
not
infer
from
bob
s
comments
that
he
was
in
any
way
linking
our
support
of
cambridge
with
the
university
s
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
divest
from
the
oil
and
gas
last
week
about
cambridge
academics
signed
a
letter
to
the
university
and
its
colleges
which
enjoy
a
certain
degree
of
independence
from
the
university
s
central
administration
to
excise
fossil
fuel
investments
from
the
roughly
billion
pounds
billion
at
their
disposal
we
call
on
the
university
s
investment
office
to
immediately
freeze
any
new
investments
in
fossil
fuel
companies
and
to
divest
from
direct
ownership
and
any
commingled
funds
that
include
fossil
fuel
public
equities
and
corporate
bonds
within
five
years
an
open
letter
said
signatories
include
chemist
david
king
who
was
britain
s
special
representative
for
climate
change
until
last
year
following
his
stint
as
the
government
s
chief
scientific
advisor
activists
in
the
cambridge
zero
carbon
society
said
they
received
a
letter
on
monday
from
stephen
toope
which
stated
the
university
had
a
leadership
role
in
understanding
and
tackling
climate
change
the
objective
is
to
promote
and
execute
urgent
and
tangible
action
to
deliver
a
carbon
neutral
future
the
university
is
already
taking
steps
that
must
be
further
expanded
in
the
areas
of
its
investments
research
education
estate
and
policy
decisions
toope
s
letter
said
this
mirrored
cambridge
s
response
when
asked
about
dudley
s
comments
a
spokesman
for
the
activist
group
said
in
response
to
dudley
if
the
university
is
unable
to
divest
its
endowment
in
line
with
the
democratic
wishes
of
students
and
staff
due
to
these
threats
then
there
is
no
longer
academic
independence
at
the
world
s
top
oil
and
gas
companies
are
facing
rising
pressure
from
investors
to
shift
to
cleaner
energy
and
renewables
in
order
to
meet
international
targets
to
sharply
reduce
carbon
emissions
by
the
end
of
the
century
dudley
said
that
bp
was
going
to
invest
around
million
per
year
in
renewables
in
the
coming
years
but
that
the
world
will
need
oil
and
gas
for
many
years
to
pounds
