executives
said
at
a
conference
on
tuesday
the
global
lng
industry
has
been
expecting
prices
to
be
depressed
by
a
rush
of
supply
as
projects
to
produce
million
to
million
tonnes
per
year
of
lng
are
coming
online
mainly
in
australia
and
the
united
states
over
the
next
two
years
but
a
surge
in
asian
demand
last
year
took
the
market
by
surprise
with
some
producers
now
expecting
the
new
supply
to
be
easily
absorbed
by
the
increasing
consumption
across
asia
for
the
past
three
years
we
were
told
at
every
conference
that
we
ll
have
a
gas
bubble
that
gas
is
oversupplied
that
we
won
t
be
able
to
sell
lng
but
it
s
a
bubble

still
import
large
volumes
of

this

though
at
a
slower
pace
the
executives
said
china
s
lng
imports
soared
after
the
government
ordered
millions
of
homes
to
switch
to
natural
gas
and
electric

from

the

we

not

for
