a
gauge
of
world
stocks
tumbled
on
tuesday
erasing
early
gains
as

scaled
the

threshold
for
the
first
time
in
four
years
while
oil
prices
reversed
course
after
climbing
above
the

mark
equities
in
europe
hit
session
lows
before
closing
near
the
unchanged
mark
and

began
to
retreat

crossed
the

mark

up

late
on

the
move
higher
in
yields
sapped
the
appetite
for
stocks
which
initially
rose
on
a
strong
batch
of
earnings
from
verizon
and
caterpillar
rising
bond
yields
provide
more
competition
for
stocks
especially
those
with
high
dividend
yields
these
higher
treasury
yields
are
providing
competition
with
riskier
fixed
income
products
and
things
like
reits

northey
senior
vice
president
with

wealth
management
in
helena
montana
the
bond
market
since
late
last
week
stemmed
from
inflation
worries
caused
by
rising
commodity
prices
and
growing
treasury
debt
supply
as
well
as
bets
the
federal
reserve
would
raise
key
borrowing
costs
further
analysts
said
higher
commodity
prices
also
pose
a
risk
for
equities
with
caterpillar
shares
reversing
course
and
last
down
percent
after
the
heavy
equipment
maker
forecast
increases
in
material
expenditures
due
to
rising
steel
prices
there
are
factors
that
are
adding
to
inflation
pressure
like
a
tightening
labor
market
trade
tension
and
rising
commodity
prices
