belarus leader says may loosen grip on power - but not yet
minsk
reuters
belarussian
president
alexander
lukashenko
on
tuesday
said
the
constitution
could
be
improved
to
share
some
of
his
powers
but
not
in
the
near
future
lukashenko
has
run
belarus
in
authoritarian
style
since
during
which
time
he
changed
the
constitution
to
expand
his
control
and
push
opposition
forces
out
of
parliament
in
an
annual
address
to
lawmakers
that
referenced
the
overthrow
of
armenia
s
prime
minister
lukashenko
said
he
was
considering
decentralising
some
of
his
authority
the
constitution
will
be
improved
life
changes
and
we
change
he
said
yes
i
can
easily
hand
over
some
powers
to
other
branches
of
he
was
speaking
a
day
after
armenian
prime
minister
serzh
sarksyan
resigned
after
almost
two
weeks
of
street
protests
lukashenko
said
he
had
asked
the
constitutional
court
to
prepare
recommendations
on
changes
to
the
constitution
but
cautioned
that
the
plans
were
theoretical
for
now
personally
i
have
not
even
thought
about
a
referendum
yet
he
said
referring
to
the
public
vote
needed
to
bring
any
changes
into
force
seeking
to
improve
ties
with
the
european
union
and
lessen
belarus
s
dependence
on
russia
lukashenko
has
in
recent
years
heeded
calls
from
the
west
to
show
more
leniency
towards
political
opposition
he
has
pardoned
several
political
prisoners
while
the
opposition
is
represented
in
parliament
for
the
first
time
in
years
following
a
election
that
western
observers
said
was
not
fully
democratic
but
an
improvement
on
previous
votes
the
opposition
in
belarus
is
made
up
of
about
a
dozen
parties
and
groups
that
have
struggled
to
popularize
their
cause
in
the
face
of
government
repression
nevertheless
in
the
biggest
public
protests
in
years
prompted
the
authorities
to
suspend
a
new
tax
on
those
not
in
employment
a
rare
for
lukashenko
citing
ukraine
s
maidan
uprising
and
the
political
upheaval
in
armenia
lukashenko
said
any
constitutional
changes
would
be
carried
out
in
accordance
with
the
law
to
prevent
public
outcry
and
instability
if
someone
thinks
that
we
will
take
the
constitution
and
create
conditions
for
our
own
maidans
that
won
t
happen
he
said
i
promised
and
will
never
break
my
vow
otherwise
it
will
be
like
