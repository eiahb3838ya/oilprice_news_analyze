a
gauge
of
world
stocks
dipped
on
tuesday
relinquishing
earlier
gains
after
bond
yields
crossed
the
three
percent
threshold
for
the
first
time
in
four
years
while
oil
prices
stretched
above
the
per
barrel
mark
equities
in
europe
hit
session
lows
and
stocks
lost
ground
after
the
treasury
yield
crossed
the
percent
mark
to
a
high
of
percent
its
highest
level
since
january
in
addition
the
yield
touched
percent
for
the
first
time
since
september
benchmark
notes
last
fell
in
price
to
yield
percent
from
percent
late
on
monday
the
move
higher
in
yields
dampened
the
appetite
for
stocks
which
had
been
higher
on
the
back
of
a
strong
batch
of
earnings
from
names
such
as
verizon
up
percent
and
caterpillar
up
percent
the
market
has
to
get
used
to
the
notion
that
this
could
be
just
another
step
in
reversing
a
trend
that
has
been
in
place
in
the
market
for
nearly
four
decades
said
frank
cappelleri
technical
market
analyst
and
trader
at
instinet
in
new
york
referring
to
declining
rates
on
bond
yields
from
my
perspective
if
this
downtrend
is
going
to
break
this
is
the
best
chance
of
it
over
the
last
five
the
ftseurofirst
index
lost
percent
and
msci
s
gauge
of
stocks
across
the
globe
shed
percent
msci
s
index
has
declined
for
three
straight
sessions
its
longest
losing
streak
in
a
month
gains
on
wall
street
were
also
hemmed
in
by
a
percent
drop
in
google
parent
alphabet
as
strong
growth
in
ad
sales
on
search
and
youtube
were
not
enough
to
offset
a
surge
in
costs
google
kicked
off
a
big
week
for
tech
sector
earnings
with
results
expected
from
names
in
the
group
including
facebook
and
microsoft
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
fell
points
or
percent
to
the
s
p
lost
points
or
percent
to

the
nasdaq
composite
dropped
points
or
percent
to
chipmaker
ams
slumped
in
swiss
trading
after
it
reported
sales
towards
the
lower
end
of
its
guidance
range
on
monday
and
warned
of
a
downturn
owing
to
weaker
orders
from
one
of
its
main
customers
ams
did
not
name
the
customer
but
the
austrian
company
is
a
big
supplier
to
apple
making
components
for
the
iphone
earnings
thus
far
have
gotten
off
to
the
strong
start
that
was
expected
with
the
expected
growth
rate
for
the
quarter
currently
at
percent
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
of
the
companies
in
the
s
p
that
have
reported
through
tuesday
morning
percent
have
topped
expectations
brent
crude
oil
prices
the
global
benchmark
rose
above
a
barrel
to
their
highest
level
since
november
supported
by
production
cuts
strong
demand
and
the
prospect
of
renewed
sanctions
on
iran
crude
rose
percent
to
per

and
brent
was
last
at
