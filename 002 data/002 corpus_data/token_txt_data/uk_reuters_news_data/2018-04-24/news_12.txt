u.s. epa set to unveil policy barring 'secret science' -sources
washington
april
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
is
close
to
announcing
a
new
policy
that
would
stop
it
from
relying
on
scientific
research
underpinned
by
confidential
data
in
its
rulemaking
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
the
measure
will
be
billed
by
the
agency
as
a
way
to
boost
transparency
for
the
benefit
of
the
industries
it
regulates
according
to
the
sources
who
asked
not
to
be
named
but
scientists
and
former
epa
officials
worry
the
move
will
hamstring
the
agency
s
ability
to
protect
public
health
by
putting
key
medical
and
industry
data
off
limits
epa
administrator
scott
pruitt
who
has
been
pursuing
president
donald
trump
s
mission
to
ease
the
regulatory
burden
on
business
is
expected
to
unveil
the
new
policy
as
early
as
tuesday
afternoon
the
sources
said
epa
officials
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
the
epa
has
for
decades
relied
on
scientific
research
that
is
rooted
in
confidential
medical
and
industry
data
as
a
basis
for
its
air
water
and
chemicals
rules
while
it
publishes
enormous
amounts
of
research
and
data
to
the
public
the
confidential
material
is
held
back
business
interests
have
argued
the
practice
is
tantamount
to
writing
laws
behind
closed
doors
and
unfairly
prevents
them
from
vetting
the
research
underpinning
the
epa
s
often
costly
regulatory
requirements
they
argue
that
if
the
data
can
t
be
published
then
the
rules
should
not
be
adopted
but
officials
say
the
practice
is
vital
other
government
agencies
also
use
studies
like
these
to
develop
policy
and
regulations
and
to
buttress
and
defend
rules
against
legal
challenges
they
are
in
fact
essential
to
making
sound
public
policy
former
epa
administrator
gina
mccarthy
and
former
assistant
administrator
for
air
and
water
janet
mccabe
wrote
in
an
in
the
new
york
times
last
month
the
new
policy
would
be
based
on
proposed
legislation
spearheaded
by
house
science
chairman
lamar
smith
a
republican
from
texas
who
denies
mainstream
climate
change
science
emails
obtained
through
a
public
records
request
last
week
showed
smith
or
his
staff
met
with
pruitt
s
staff
in
recent
months
to
craft
the
policy
those
emails
also
showed
that
pruitt
s
staff
grappled
with
the
possibility
the
policy
would
complicate
things
for
the
chemicals
industry
which
submits
reams
of
confidential
data
to
epa
regulatory
programs
an
official

smith
s
office
