another

was
sworn
in
as
president
earlier
this
month
after
being
elected
by
parliament
under
a
revised
constitution
approved
in
a
referendum
most
state
powers
shifted
to
the
prime
minister
while
the
presidency
became
a
largely
ceremonial
post
the
opposition
and
ruling
party
could
not
agree
on
an
agenda
or
format
for
wednesday
s
meeting
although
karapetyan
said
one
of
the
topics
at
a
rescheduled
session
could
be
holding
early
parliamentary
elections
something
pashinyan
was
insisting
on
in
another
move
likely
to
prolong
the
political
crisis
that
has
rocked
one
of
russia
s
closest
allies
from
the
former
soviet
union
pashinyan
said
on
tuesday
he
was
ready
to
be
the
country
s
next
premier
and
would
keep
up
pressure
on
the
ruling
elite
until
it
agreed
to
real
change
if
people
put
this
responsibility
on
me
i
m
ready
to
become
the
prime
minister
pashinyan
wearing
his
trademark
black
baseball
cap
and
told
reporters
the
politician
said
the
velvet
revolution
he
had
helped
bring
about
was
not
over
and
that
the
next
step
would
be
the
election
of
a
new
prime
minister
by
parliament
and
the
holding
of
an
early
parliamentary
election
if
elected
pashinyan
said
he
would
try
to
maintain
a
balance
in
foreign
policy
but
ruled
out
challenging
the
presence
of
russian
military
bases
in
armenia
or
the
country
s
membership
in
military
and
economic
alliances
we
are
not
going
to
make
any
sharp
geopolitical
moves
he
said
many
experts
said
it
was
too
early
to
predict
what
lies
ahead
what
is
needed
is
a
sober
reconfiguration
said
richard
giragosian
a
director
of
the
regional
studies
centre
yet
such
consensus
and
compromise
seems
very
far
away
and
with
mounting
expectations
and
anger
dangerously
high
the
real
challenge
of
governance
is
only
