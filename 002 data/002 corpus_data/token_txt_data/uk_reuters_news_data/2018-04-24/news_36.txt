kremlin: we don't regard tumult in armenia as ukraine-style revolution
moscow
reuters
the
kremlin
said
on
tuesday
it
did
not
regard
political
tumult
in
armenia
a
close
russian
ally
as
a
revolution
and
was
pleased
that
the
situation
there
appeared
stable
for
now
the
kremlin
was
speaking
a
day
after
armenian
prime
minister
serzh
sarksyan
resigned
after
almost
two
weeks
of
mass
street
protests
that
plunged
the
republic
into
political
crisis
for
now
we
see
that
the
situation
is
not
unfolding
in
a
destabilising
way
which
is
a
cause
for
satisfaction
kremlin
spokesman
dmitry
peskov
told
reporters
on
a
conference
call
we
hope
that
order
and
stability
will
be
maintained
in
the
country
and
that
the
outlines
of
a
consensus
political
configuration
will
appear
in
the
near
when
asked
if
the
kremlin
regarded
the
events
as
a
revolution
peskov
said
he
would
not
draw
parallels
with
what
happened
in
ukraine
in
when
big
protests
brought
about
a
change
in
power
that
shifted
the
country
away
from
russia
s
orbit
towards
the
west
