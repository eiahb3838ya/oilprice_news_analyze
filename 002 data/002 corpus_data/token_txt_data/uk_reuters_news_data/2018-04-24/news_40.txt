chipmaker

reported

on

and

owing
to
weaker

from

brent

crude

and
renewed

on
the

outlook
has
added
to
upward
pressure
on
bond
yields
recently
it
is
this
move
higher
in
crude
oil
prices
along
with
the
rise
in
demand
that
is
helping
fuel
the
recent
rise
in
yields
as
well
as
the
positive
tone
for
equity
markets
said
michael
hewson
chief
market
analyst
at

markets
in

however
if
it
continues
too
far
we
could
start
to
see
it
act
as
a
drag
on
equity
markets
if
prices
along
with
yields
start
to
move
even
the
fallout
from
rising
bond
yields
which
have
helped
lift
financial
stocks
was
also
felt
in
currency
markets

euro
fell
to
a
low
as
concerns
that
rising
treasury
yields
would
push
the

to
break
