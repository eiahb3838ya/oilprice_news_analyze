forecast
core
earnings
of
billion
to
billion
euros
billion
below
analyst
expectations
for
about
billion
and
with
the
low
end
of
the
forecast
range
only
just
above

we
are
not
sure
some
of
the

in

be
repeated

told

on
a

he
said
that
besides
exceptionally
good
hydropower
earnings
trading
results
were
also
above
what
could
be
expected
in
a
normal
year
but
added
that
wholesale
power
prices
should
be
slightly
higher
this
year
it
is
possible
our
results
would
be
close
to
those
of

we
hope
that
they
will
not
come
in
at
the
lower

kept
a
buy
rating
on
edf
said
that
edf
s
latest
guidance
was
some
percent
below
consensus
expectations
at
first
glance
the
more
moderate
growth
compared
to
expectations
may
be
due
to
lower
open
exposure
to
power
prices
normalization
of
french

in

with

down
from

edf
said
the
state
which
owns
an

would
take
the

were
down
