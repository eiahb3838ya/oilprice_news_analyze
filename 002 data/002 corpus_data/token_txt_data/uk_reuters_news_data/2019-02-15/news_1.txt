venezuela opposition to leave citgo funds, management untouched -envoy
washington
reuters
venezuela
s
opposition
has
no
plans
to
use
funds
belonging
to
refiner
citgo
which
is
owned
by
state
oil
company
pdvsa
despite
having
named
a
new
board
for
the
company
this
week
the
interim
government
s
envoy
said
on
friday
the
opposition
will
not
make
changes
to
the
refining
company
s
management
or
operations
until
juan
guaido
the
leader
of
venezuela
s
congress
who
swore
himself
in
as
president
last
month
has
control
of
state
functions
said
carlos
vecchio
guaido
s
representative
in
washington
we
are
not
touching
that
money
it
belongs
to
citgo
as
a
corporation
vecchio
said
in
an
interview
we
want
citgo
in
financial
health
and
for
operations
to
continue
and
for
that
money
to
stay
there
for
when
we
are
able
to
take
effective
control
of
power
and
the
state
s
institutions
including
citgo
which
owns
about
percent
of
oil
refining
capacity
has
become
central
to
the
power
struggle
between
guaido
and
embattled
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
since
the
united
states
slapped
sanctions
on
petroleos
de
venezuela
known
as
pdvsa
last
month
the
sanctions
require
companies
importing
venezuelan
crude
to
make
payments
into
an
account
held
in
escrow
for
guaido
s
government
in
a
bid
to
oust
maduro
who
has
overseen
a
collapse
in
oil
production
in
the
opec
nation
which
is
undergoing
a
severe
economic
and
humanitarian
crisis
vecchio
said
the
opposition
had
not
yet
opened
an
account
with
any
financial
institution
the
sanctions
also
complicate
venezuela
s
ability
to
make
an
april
payment
on
pdvsa
s
bond
for
which
part
of
citgo
has
been
put
up
as
collateral
that
could
prompt
creditors
to
attempt
to
seize
the
refining
company
s
assets
a
situation
vecchio
said
guaido
s
team
wanted
to
avoid
pdvsa
has
also
been
struggling
to
refinance
a
revolving
line
of
credit
by
a
july
deadline
people
close
to
the
matter
said
guaido
has
invoked
venezuela
s
constitution
to
claim
the
presidency
arguing
that
the
may
vote
resulting
in
maduro
s
was
a
sham
maduro
has
called
guaido
a
puppet
and
vowed
that
he
will
not
allow
citgo
to
be
vecchio
said
the
opposition
upon
taking
power
would
prioritize
attracting
private
investment
to
boost
oil
production
which
has
fallen
to
near
lows
but
had
no
plans
to
privatize
pdvsa
there
is
a
very
clear
consensus
that
pdvsa
should
be
maintained
as
property
of
the
state
vecchio
said
but
if
we
want
to
increase
production
as
much
as
we
hope
most
of
the
investment
is
going
to
have
to
come
from
the
private
sector
because
the
state
will
not
have
anything
to
he
added
that
venezuela
would
not
leave
opec
the
oil
producers
cartel
of
which
it
is
a
founding
member
but
also
would
not
accept
any
opec
deals
that
would
limit
the
south
american
country
s
efforts
to
boost
oil
production
as
i
see
it
opec
today
has
a
diminished
role
on
the
world
stage
because
it
does
not
have
the
market
it
once
had
vecchio
said
citing
growing
crude
output
