orla
de
wardener
said
she
had
been
inspired
by
the
example
of
greta
thunberg
a
student
whose
regular
friday
protests
outside
sweden
s
parliament
have
led
to
a
spreading
international
school
strike
movement
after
reading
about
thunberg
in
a
children
s
science
magazine
i
was
totally
enthralled
with
her
she
s
amazing
said
de
wardener
a
student
at
weston
park
primary
school
near
finsbury
park
in
north
london
adults
she
said
do
not
act
on
climate
change
because
they
re
involved
with
their
money
and
their
work
they
don
t
care
said
de
wardener
who
sported
a
polar
bear
hat
and
a
sign
reading
your
failure
our
future
politicians
she
said
have
had
their
life
they
don
t
see
much
point
in
fighting
for
the
future
her
classmate
iris
adderley
said
she
was
worried
about
the
quickening
pace
of
extinctions
in
nature
and
the
risks
of
sea
level
rise
including
flooding
in
britain
adults
just
don
t
think
about
it
enough
she
said
nora
mackay
a
student
at
graveney
school
in
tooting
south
london
said
her
school
s
administration
had
discouraged
students
from
attending
the
protest
but
everyone
is
here
anyway
she
said
my
parents
said
go
on
the
march
the
future
of
the
world
is
more
important
than
one
day
of
school
she
said
standing
with
dozens
of
classmates
in
the
square
christiana
figueres
who
was
climate
chief
when
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
was
agreed
said
she
hoped
politicians
would
heed
the
deeply
moving
voice
of
youth
and
schoolchildren
who
are
so
worried
about
their
future
that
children
feel
they
need
to
strike
to
draw
attention
to
the
problem
is
a
sign
we
are
failing
in
our
responsibility
to
protect
them
from
the
worsening
impacts
of
climate
change
she
said
john
sauven
the
executive
director
of
greenpeace
uk
said
students
were
taking
action
because
young
people
know
their
lives
are
going
to
be
changed
dramatically
by
the
impacts
of
climate
change
the
risks
that
older
people
hope
they
might
dodge
are
the
problems
the
young
will
inherit
he
warned
in
a
press
release
while
we
re
failing
to
deliver
the
changes
young
people
need
we
can
hardly
blame
them
for
taking
action
global
temperatures
are
on
course
for
a
rise
of
degrees
to
degrees
celsius
degrees
to
degrees
fahrenheit
this
century
far
overshooting
a
global
target
of
limiting
the
increase
to
or
less
the
world
meteorological
organization
says
that
is
bringing
growing
risks
from
extreme
weather
including
worsening
droughts
floods
fires
and
storms
as
well
as
threats
of
worsening
hunger
poverty
and
water
shortages
scientists
say
limiting
those
risks
will
require
rapid
and
unprecedented
changes
to
the
world
s
energy
systems
and
to
human
behavior
scientists
said
in
an
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
report
released
last
october
friday
s
protests
are
just
the
latest
in
an
international
string
of
youth
strikes
and
efforts
to
sue
governments
to
protect
future
generations
many
of
them
led
by
people
too
young
to
vote
organisers
of
the
british
protests
said
their
demands
included
more
information
about
the
ecological
crisis
in
the
national
curriculum
declaration
of
a
national
climate
emergency
and
a
lowering
of
the
national
voting
age
to
many
of
the
students
at
the
parliament
square
protests
said
they
were
taking
action
in
their
own
lives
to
cut
emissions
from
eating
less
meat
to
cutting
out
airline
flights
and
walking
or
biking
more
others
said
they
and
many
of
their
classmates
were
choosing
to
write
speeches
and
essays
on
climate
change
as
part
of
their
schoolwork
and
that
they
saw
the
issue
becoming
a
hot
topic
on
social
media
many
of
friday
s
protests
were
organised
via
social
media
with
participants
saying
they
had
read
up
on
climate
change
there
zakiyya
who
attends
clapton
girls
academy
in
hackney
in
east
london
and
asked
that
her
surname
not
be
used
said
she
became
a
vegan
last
year
after
learning
how
much
meat
and
dairy
production
drove
emissions
this
is
our
lives
our
future
if
we
want
to
live
we
need
to
make
changes
now
she
said
carrying
a
sign
pleading
we
are
scared
listen
to
us
bruno
olliffe
of
norwich
in
the
east
of
england
said
he
and
his
family
had
taken
up
recycling
but
he
thought
the
most
powerful
way
to
bring
change
was
to
convince
parliamentarians
of
the
need
one
reason
he
d
traveled
to
london
with
his
mother
right
now
they
re
too
stuffed
up
with
brexit
said
the
when
it
comes
to
climate
change
they
don
t
realise
how
bad
it
is
but
we
speeches
by
thunberg
and
naturalist
david
attenborough
had
made
it
clear
he
said
that
the
impacts
will
hit
the
whole
world
every
corner
it
s
my
future
and
i
don
t
want
it
to
be
ruined
