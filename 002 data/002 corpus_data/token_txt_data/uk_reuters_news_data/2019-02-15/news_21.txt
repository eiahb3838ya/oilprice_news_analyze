analysis-european lng influx plays into gazpromâ€™s hands this winter
london
reuters
changing
gas
price
dynamics
caused
by
an
influx
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
to
europe
have
played
into
russian
producer
gazprom
s
hands
and
enabled
it
to
increase
pipeline
flows
to
the
continent
so
far
this
year
gazprom
is
moving
determinedly
with
spot
gas
sales
in
europe
due
to
a
spike
in
lng
sales
to
the
continent
in
october
to
january
compared
with
a
year
earlier
but
sales
within
gazprom
contracts
are
also
rising
in
january
gazprom
gas
flows
to
europe
totalled
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
an
almost
bcm
rise
from
the
same
month
a
year
earlier
gazprom
data
shows
one
reason
for
the
rise
is
a
change
in
time
spreads
on
european
wholesale
gas
contracts
which
is
enabling
some
traders
to
increase
purchases
in
deals
with
gazprom
or
through
spot
auctions
by
the
company
this
trend
shows
how
lng
which
has
flooded
europe
since
october
is
reshaping
gas
prices
and
flows
in
the
continent
with
traders
still
adjusting
to
the
new
market
environment
lng
has
really
changed
the
situation
a
gas
trader
said
we
have
to
write
new
a
jump
in
lng
supplies
contributed
significantly
to
oversupply
in
the
european
gas
market
leading
to
high
storage
levels
and
pushing
down
price
spreads
gas
prices
in
most
european
countries
are
almost
on
par
with
summer
contract
prices
which
makes
it
more
profitable
to
buy
gas
on
the
prompt
market
rather
than
withdraw
it
from
storage
sites
when
you
look
at
storages
due
to
the
pricing
being
flattish
compared
to
the
summer
it
makes
sense
not
to
withdraw
as
you
can
t
cover
the
withdrawal
fees
with
the
spread
between
the
and
summer
a
trader
said
this
week
the
price
on
the
dutch
hub
has
traded
slightly
below
the
summer
contract
price
a
year
ago
it
was
trading
almost
percent
above
the
summer
contract
dutch
wholesale
gas
prices
at
the
current
to
summer
spread
it
makes
sense
to
reduce
withdrawal
and
keep
the
contract
with
gazprom
running
a
trader
in
continental
europe
said
gas
traders
have
a
bearish
outlook
for
both
contracts
meaning
gazprom
s
flows
could
remain
high
until
the
end
of
march
with
europe
entering
the
summer
season
with
storage
levels
gazprom
s
trading
arm
gazprom
marketing
and
trading
has
also
been
more
active
on
european
hubs
selling
gas
traders
said
in
the
spot
market
gazprom
has
been
selling
gas
in
auctions
it
launched
in
september
in
february
the
majority
of
gas
in
auction
has
been
sold
for
prompt
delivery
so
far
while
in
january
traders
bought
more
february
contracts
expecting
cold
weather
traders
said
the
price
in
auctions
is
usually
very
close
to
that
on
european
hubs
showing
gazprom
is
becoming
more
flexible
with
its
price
strategy
to
win
buyers
on
the
continent
refinitiv
analysts
expect
storage
in
northwest
europe
excluding
britain
to
close
the
winter
season
at
around
terrawatt
hours
twh
against
twh
at
the
end
of
march
gas
storage
levels
in
belgium
france
the
netherlands
and
germany
this
would
be
the
highest
stock
level
since
and

summer
gas
contracts
further
the
dutch
summer
price
is
percent
cheaper
this
week
than
a
year
ago
and
is
showing
the
biggest
discount
to
the
next
winter
contract
in
seven
years
summer
contracts
in
europe
are
widely
forecast
to
be
very
weak
this
year
a
trader
said
but
what
everyone
expects
is
not
usually
what
happens
as
it
