plans

billion
to
help
clear
power
sector
debt
destabilising
the
finances
of
the
government
and
private
power
producers
a
senior
official
tasked
with
energy
reforms
said
pakistan
s
economy
and
society
have
been
racked
by
a
decade
of
chronic
electricity
shortages
which
have
crippled
its
manufacturing
industries
and
stoked
voter
anger
in
the
south
asian
nation
of
million
people
electricity
shortages
have
eased
in
the
last
months
but
years
of
mismanagement
and
funding
shortfalls
for
subsidies
have
led
to
accumulated
power
sector
payment
arrears
or
circular
debt
soaring
to
trillion
rupees
billion
independent
power
producers
ipps
angry
with
late
government
payments
have
warned
they
face
a
financial
crisis
while
economists
fear
rising
circular
debt
will
further
widen
pakistan
s
yawning
fiscal
deficit
a
key
part
of
ongoing
bailout
talks
with
the
international
monetary
fund
pakistan
earlier
this
month
raised
billion
rupees
through
an
islamic
bond
to
ease
a
financial
crunch
in
its
power
sector
but
critics
say
much
more
needs
to
be
done
nadeem
babar
head
of
the
task
force
on
energy
reforms
created
by
new
prime
minister
imran
khan
told
reuters
the
government
plans
to
ease
financial
pressures
on
power
generation
companies
by
taking
another
billion
rupee
loan
by
april
that
total
of
billion
will
not
bring
the
outstanding
amount
down
to
zero
but
it
will
pay
it
down
substantially
to
a
point
where
no
generator
will
be
at
risk
of
shutting
down
or
having
liquidity
issues
babar
told
reuters
on
thursday
the
loans
are
a
key
part
of
the
government
s
strategy
to
rethink
how
it
deals
with
power
arrears
and
will
give
the
government
breathing
room
to
enact
reforms
babar
added
he
said
khan
s
government
is
looking
to
save
money
by
moving
power
sector
arrears
from
the
balance
sheet
of
the
independent
power
producers
ipps
on
to
the
balance
sheet
of
distribution
companies
under
pakistan
s
power
purchasing
system
ipps
bill
the
government
monthly
for
the
power
they
produce
but
when
the
government
fails
to
pay
up
power
generators
take
commercial
bank
loans
to
stay
afloat
and
the
government
is
hit
with
financial
penalties
for
late
payments
in
the
past
to
keep
debt
off
the
government
s
power
companies
balance
sheet
the
government
has
allowed
a
run
up
of
the
same
debt
on
ipp
balance
sheets
but
at
what
cost
said
babar
who
is
currently
writing
pakistan
s
future
energy
policy
the
finance
minister
has
understood
and
agreed
that
it
is
nonsensical
that
we
are
paying
about
percent
higher
interest
rate
to
keep
this
debt
off
our
balance
sheet
when
we
acknowledge
that
it
is
our
debt
said
babar
pakistan
hiked
electricity
prices
in
january
and
the
new
tariff
set
to
gradually
increase
over
the
next
two
and
half
years
will
drastically
slow
the
accumulation
of
circular
debt
and
will
eventually
help
eradicate
it
babar
said
transmission
losses
and
theft
are
also
being
aggressively
targeted
by
the
government
