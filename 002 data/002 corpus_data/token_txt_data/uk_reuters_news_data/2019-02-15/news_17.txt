further

bill
and
additional

injection
he
said
efforts
since
late
december
to
battle
rampant
fuel
theft
in
mexico
will
result
in
savings
of
about
billion
while
a
plan
to
increase

will
generate
more

it
s
injecting
resources
it
s
lowering

it

luis
gonzalez
a
portfolio
manager
at
franklin
templeton
investments
in

city
noting
that
the
capital
boost
plus
lowered

would
still
barely
save
pemex
from
needing
refinancing
this
year
however
he
praised
the
commitment
to
double
down
on
relief
measures
if
necessary
the
unconditional

they
expressed
