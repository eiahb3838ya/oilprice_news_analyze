retail
sales
tumbled
percent
in

recording
their
biggest
drop
since
september
as
receipts
fell
across
the
board
the
shockingly
weak
report
led
to
economic

cut

kazushige
kaida
head
of
foreign
exchange
at
state
street
in
tokyo
said
he
was
very
surprised
by
the
retail
sales
data
the
extraordinary
weakness
however
appears
to
be
owing
in
part
to
the
government
shutdown
though
the
exact
extent
of
its
impact
is
not
clear
he
said
it
would
be
premature
to
think
the
economy
has
lost
steam
completely
we
have
to
wait
for
figures
in
the
next
couple
of
months
kaida
said
the
collapse
in
retail
sales
came
along
with
data
showing
an
unexpected
increase
in
the
number
of
americans
filing
claims
for
unemployment
benefits
last

the

the
volatile

rose
to
the
highest

in
more

that
prompted
