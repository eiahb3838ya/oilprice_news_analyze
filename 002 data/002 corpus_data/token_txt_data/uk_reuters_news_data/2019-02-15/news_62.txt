after
grim
retail

figures
raised
fresh
doubts
about
the

of
the

offsetting
optimism
on
trade
talks
between
the
united
states
and
china
also
casting
a
shadow
the
white

said
president
donald
trump
will

deal
retail
sales
tumbled
percent
in
december
recording
their
biggest
drop
since
september
as
receipts
fell
across
the
board
the
shockingly
weak
report
led
to
economic
growth
estimates
for

cut
to
below
a
percent

rate

kazushige
kaida
head
of
foreign
exchange
at
state
street
in
tokyo
said
he
was
very
surprised
by
the
retail
sales
data
the
extraordinary
weakness
however
appears
to
be
owing
in
part
to
the
government
shutdown
though
the
exact
extent
of
its
impact
is
not
clear
he
said
it
would
be
premature
to
think
the
economy
has
lost
steam
completely
we
have
to
wait
for
figures
in
the
next
couple
of

collapse
in

sales
came
along
with
data
showing
an
unexpected
increase
in

claims
for
unemployment
benefits
last

the

the
volatile

rose
to
the
highest

in
more
