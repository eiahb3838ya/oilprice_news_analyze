update 1-germany may change law to comply with eu pipeline rules - minister
adds
details
and
context
munich
feb
reuters
germany
is
considering
changes
to
the
legal
framework
governing
the
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
to
make
sure
that
it
complies
with
new
european
union
regulations
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
told
reuters
on
friday
the
eu
this
week
agreed
new
rules
for
gas
import
pipelines
stipulating
that
the
pipelines
should
not
be
owned
by
gas
suppliers
and
that
third
parties
should
also
be
able
to
use
them
the
new
eu
deal
casts
doubt
over
the
structure
of
russia
s
planned
nord
stream
pipeline
which
already
faces
uncertainty
after
denmark
s
potential
ban
on
its
planned
route
which
includes
danish
territorial
waters
altmaier
said
the
pipeline
could
still
be
built
under
the
new
conditions
but
there
would
clearly
be
some
changes
one
regarding
the
ownership
of
the
pipeline
since
european
law
requires
ownership
of
pipeline
and
production
to
be
separated
altmaier
said
on
the
margins
of
the
munich
security
conference
there
may
also
be
changes
regarding
who
has
access
to
the
pipeline
and
who
can
feed
the
pipeline
currently
under
construction
under
the
baltic
sea
and
fully
owned
by
russia
s
gazprom
is
seen
by
berlin
as
a
primarily
commercial
project
that
is
essential
to
germany
s
ongoing
energy
security
but
eastern
european
nordic
and
baltic
sea
countries
see
the
km
mile
pipeline
as
increasing
eu
reliance
on
moscow
the
project
also
faces
opposition
from
washington
altmaier
said
it
was
in
germany
s
interest
that
the
pipeline
be
built
together
with
our
european
partners
but
that
any
amendments
to
the
project
to
allow
it
to
meet
the
new
conditions
had
to
be
germany
s
decision
alone
