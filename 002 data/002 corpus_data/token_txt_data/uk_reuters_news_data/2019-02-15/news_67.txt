drilling
curbs
by
oil
producers
in
the
largest
shale
field
will
continue
until
transport
bottlenecks
ease
and
investors
stop
punishing
companies
for
increasing
capital
spending
executives
at
an
energy
conference
said
on
thursday
the
price
of
crude
in
the
permian
basin
of
west
texas
and
new
mexico
fell
sharply
last
year
selling
as
much
as
below
benchmark
prices
as
a
lack
of
pipeline
capacity
landlocked
some
oil
output
and
as
investors
pushed
producers
to
reduce
spending
and
boost
shareholder
returns
on
thursday
the
regional
price
of
crude
was
at
a
a
barrel
premium
to
crude
futures
the
strongest
in
more
than
a
year
as
companies
including
parsley
energy
pioneer
natural
resources
goodrich
petroleum
corp
have
pared
their
exploration
budgets
easing
the
constraints
pioneer

co
one
of
the
permian
s
largest
producers
said
this
week
it
plans
to
reduce
capital
expenditures
by
percent
or
about
million
slowing
its
production
growth
from
prior
years
there
aren
t
nearly
as
many
drilling
dollars
available
said
bobby
whiteside

regions
permian
llc
if
wall
street
wants
you
to
drill
within
cash
flow
you
re
going
to
have
slower
the
permian
is
the
nation
s
largest
and
fastest
growing
oil
field
its
output
has
driven
crude
production
to
near
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
forcing
opec
and
allies
to
cut
their
output
oil
and
gas
officials
interviewed
at
the
houston
conference
say
the
recent
shale
cutbacks
will
remain
until
three
proposed
pipelines
from
west
texas
to
the
gulf
coast
come
online
over
the
next
months
executives
said
the
recent
strengthening
of
regional
crude
prices
suggest
that
producers
can
expect
oil
sold
at
midland
texas
to
slip
from
the
current
premium
to
a
to
per
barrel
discount
to
benchmark
crude
in
the
second
quarter
i
don
t
think
you
ll
see
a
big
differential
again
unless
they
grow
production
over
capacity

an
employee
of
texas
oil
producer
chisholm
energy
which
drills
in
the
permian
we
re
about
at
breakeven
now
and
that
has
really
helped
us

the
oil
industry
could
easily
meet
the
energy
information
administration
s
forecasts
over
the
next
two
years
if
wall
street
still
rewarded
production
growth
over
returns
said
allen
gilmer
founder
of

intelligence
provider

but
with
investors
insisting
on
free
cash
flow
and
dividends
maybe
we
won

these
guys
have
amazing
assets
but
their
stock
prices
haven

benefited
at
all
from
