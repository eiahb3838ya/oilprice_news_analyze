thermal

tumbling

said
a
significant
slowdown
in

also
weighed
in
coal

the

coal
inventories
at

the

were
at
million

in

million

higher
than

last

the
situation
is
similar
in
natural
gas
where
storage
facilities
hold
ample
supply
mild
weather
and
ample

have
led
to
a

james

energy
analyst
at
ihs
markit
said
earlier
this
month
more
fundamentally
demand
for
thermal
fuels
for
power
generation
has
declined
because
of
improving
energy
efficiency
and
the
rise
of
renewable
power
generation
which
is
eating
into
the
market
share
of
coal
and

our
main
concern
remains
the
outright
bearish
energy
intensity
of
key
lng

said

adding
that
the
pickup
in
renewable
power
generation
would
imply
weaker
