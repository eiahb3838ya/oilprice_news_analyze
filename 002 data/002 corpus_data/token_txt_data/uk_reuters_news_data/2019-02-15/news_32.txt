geneva
reuters
global
commodities
firm
trafigura
has
decided
to
stop
trading
oil
with
venezuela
due
to
sanctions
on
the
opec
nation
s
energy
sector
a
source
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
the
decision
will
come
as
a
blow
to
caracas
as
trafigura
has
a
arrangement
with
pdvsa
to
take
venezuelan
crude
and
in
exchange
supply
the
latin
american
country
with
refined
products
washington
imposed
fresh
sanctions
on
pdvsa
last
month
to
cut
off
a
key
source
of
revenue
for
president
nicolas
maduro
the
move
came
after
congress
head
juan
guaido
invoked
constitutional
provisions
to
become
interim
president
arguing
that
socialist
maduro
s
last
year
was
a
sham
last
year
trading
company
trafigura
directly
took
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
venezuelan
crude
and
products
which
were
mostly
resold
to
and
chinese
refineries
according
to
internal
pdvsa
trade
documents
seen
by
reuters
trafigura
will
stop
business
with
pdvsa
after
completing
a
small
number
of
trades
the
source
said
due
to
the
size
of
venezuela
s
agreements
with
china
and
russia
and
the
weight
of
previous
sanctions
pdvsa
has
become
increasingly
reliant
on
intermediaries
to
export
its
crude
and
import
refined
products
pdvsa
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
trafigura
is
due
to
load
two
cargoes
of
venezuelan
crude
before
the
end
of
february
the
source
with
direct
knowledge
and
a
shipping
source
said
it
was
not
immediately
clear
whether
these
two
tankers
were
the
last
of
the
trades
or
how
many
if
any
product
tankers
would
be
sent
in
return
for
the
trading
firm
the
decision
means
giving
up
a
source
of
crude
supply
for
indian
refiner
nayara
energy
in
which
trafigura
holds
a
near
percent
stake
nayara
would
still
be
able
to
buy
venezuelan
crude
through
russia
s
rosneft
and
other
intermediaries
the
sanctions
limit
refiners
to
paying
for
venezuelan
oil
by
using
escrow
accounts
that
can
not
be
accessed
by
maduro
s
government
foreign
firms
that
use
the
financial
system
for
oil
trading
or
units
are
similarly
restricted
cutting
off
avenues
for
pdvsa
to
collect
revenue
in
an
effort
to
ease
domestic
fuel
shortages
pdvsa
s
imports
skyrocketed
last
year
its
own
refining
system
is
hobbled
by
technical
failure
a
lack
of
investment
delayed
maintenance
and
insufficient
crude
supply
in
the
last
three
months
of
venezuela
exported
about
million
bpd
of
crude
and
products
trading
houses
lifted
bpd
of
that
according
to
the
pdvsa
documents
and
refinitiv
eikon
data
exports
to
the
united
states
venezuela
s
primary
export
customer
have
since
dried
up
as
well
as
those
to
other
destinations
with
loaded
tankers
left
stranded
off
venezuelan
ports
