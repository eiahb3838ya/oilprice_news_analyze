the
opposition
candidate
to
accuse
president
muhammadu
buhari
of
seeking
to
disenfranchise
voters
the
electoral
commission
said
the
postponement
was
due
solely
to
logistical
factors
and
denied
political
pressure
had
played
any
part
in
the
decision
buhari
and
his
rival
former
vice
president
atiku
abubakar
both
urged

to
stay
calm
mahmood
yakubu
chairman
of
the
independent
electoral
commission
said
the
election
would
now
be
held
on
adding
that
the
date
was
sacrosanct
and
that
campaigning
would
be
suspended
until
then
buhari
in
power
since

a
tight
election
contest
against
atiku
of
the
people
s
democratic
party

nigerians
expressed
dismay
and
anger
over
the
delay
in
a
country
where
million
people
have
registered
to
vote
past
elections
have
been
marred
by
violence
intimidation
and
and
the
postponement
raised
the
possibility
of
unrest
they
the
government
are
not
following
the
rule
of
law
this
is
a
total
ploy
it
is
not
true
that
they
are
not
ready

in
the
northern

had
gone
there
specially
to
vote
i
spent
my
morning
my
time
my
energy
for
the
elections
so
actually
i
am
not
happy
he
said
the
electoral
commission
s
yakubu
attributed
the
decision
to
delays
in
transporting
electoral
materials
the
postponement
has
nothing
to
do
with
security
nothing
to
do
with
political
influence
nothing
to
do
with
availability
of
resources
he
told
a
gathering
of
foreign
election
observers
and
reporters
he
said
some
sensitive
election
materials
had
been
distributed
but
all
had
been
retrieved
and
returned
to
the
central
bank
and
an
audit
would
now
be
conducted
in
nigeria
the
central
bank
stores
election
materials
for
safe
keeping
pdp
chairman
uche
secondus
said
the
postponement
was
dangerous
to
our
democracy
he
called
it
part
of
an
attempt
by
buhari
to
cling
on
to
power
even
when
it
s
obvious
to
him
that
nigerians
want
him
out
buhari
who
was
nigeria
s
military
ruler
in
the
early
expressed
disappointment
over
the
delay
but
urged
nigerians
in
a
statement
to
refrain
from
all
civil
disorder
and
remain
peaceful
patriotic
and
united
atiku
urged
voters
to
be
patient
but
later
said
buhari
s
administration
was
behind
the
delayed
elections
without
offering
any
evidence
by
instigating
this
postponement
the
buhari
administration
hopes
to
disenfranchise
the
nigerian
electorate
in
order
to
ensure
that
turnout
is
low
on
the
rescheduled
date
he
said
on
twitter
buhari
s
spokesman
garba
shehu
declined
to
comment
observer
missions

the
african
union
and
other
organisations
urged
nigerians
in
a
statement
to
remain
calm
and
supportive
of
the
election
process
and
said
the
electoral
commission
must
adhere
strictly
to
the
new
date
no
matter
who
wins
it
is
now
far
more
likely
that
the
loser
will
contest
the
result
and
argue
that
the
election
has
been
compromised
because
sensitive
materials
are
out
