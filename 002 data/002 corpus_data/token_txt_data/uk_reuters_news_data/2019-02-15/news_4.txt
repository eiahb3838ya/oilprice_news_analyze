but
if
i
do
that
if
i
see
that
we
re
close
to
a
deal
or
the

is
going
in

right
direction
i
would
do
that
at

tariffs
that
we
re
charging
now
i
would

applauded
the
announcement

language
in
a
memorandum
of
understanding
and
said
its
existence
could
cause
the
trump
to
push

deadline
it

enough
progress
has
been
made

possibly
extend
the
deadline
said
craig
allen
president
of

the
memorandum
of

they
might
the
tariff
war
that
has
roiled
financial
markets
and
disrupted
manufacturing
supply
chains
although
trump
said
this
week
that
an
extension
of
the
tariff
deadline
was
possible
if
a
real
deal
was
close
larry
kudlow
director
of

has
said
the
white
house
had
made
no
such
decision
but
several
sources
informed
about
the
meetings
told
reuters
there
was
little
indication
negotiators
had
made
major
progress
on
sticking
points
to
pave
the
way
for
a
potential
meeting
between
xi
and
trump
in
coming
weeks
to
hammer
out
a
deal
stalemate
on
the
important
stuff
said
one
source
all
of
the
sources
requested
anonymity
because
the
talks
are
confidential
there
s
still
a
lot
of
distance
between
parties
on
structural
and
enforcement
issues
said
a
second
source
i
wouldn
t
quite
call
it
hitting
a
wall
but
it
s
not
a
field
of
dreams
a
third
source
told
reuters
the
white
house
was
irate
over
earlier
reports
that
the
trump
administration
was
considering
a
extension
of
the
tariff
deadline
