germany
is
considering
changes
to
the
legal
framework
governing
the
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
to
make
sure
that
it
complies
with
new
european
union
regulations
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
told
reuters
on
friday
my
assumption
is
that
it
can
be
built
under
the
new
conditions
he
said
but
there
will
clearly
be
some
changes
one
regarding
the
ownership
of
the
pipeline
since
european
law
requires
ownership
of
pipeline
and
production
to
be
separated
there
may
also
be
changes
regarding
who
has
access
to
the
pipeline
and
who
can
feed
it
he
said
but
added
that
it
was
for
germany
to
decide
which
changes
it
would
make
and
how
