u.s. miners seek reversal of uranium mining ban near grand canyon
washington
reuters
the
mining
industry
asked
the
supreme
court
on
friday
to
overturn
an
rule
that
prohibits
the
mining
of
uranium
on
public
lands
adjacent
to
the
grand
canyon
national
park
the
national
mining
association
nma
and
the
american
exploration
and
mining
association
aema
filed
petitions
asking
the
court
to
reverse
the
obama
administration
s
ban
on
new
uranium
mining
claims
on
more
than
million
acres
of
public
land
adjacent
to
the
canyon
in
ken
salazar
then
the
secretary
of
the
interior
instituted
the
ban
for
years
on
the
public
lands
that
the
havasupai
tribe
relies
on
for
water
the
ban
was
upheld
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
december
nma
spokesman
luke
popovich
said
his
organization
was
challenging
salazar
s
constitutional
authority
to
declare
the
large
land
withdrawal
and
he
said
uranium
mining
does
not
harm
the
land
there
is
scant
evidence
that
uranium
mining
outside
the
park
boundaries
poses
any
threat
to
either
the
environment
or
visitor
experience
popovich
said
he
said
salazar
ignored
a
finding
by
the
interior
department
s
bureau
of
land
management
that
showed
mining
would
have
little
impact
conservation
groups
disagreed
and
said
the
ban
should
remain
in
place
until
scientists
have
time
to
study
the
contamination
risks
is
it
worth
gambling
the
future
of
the
grand
canyon
to
allow
private
companies
to
line
their
pockets
when
the
risks
to
groundwater
are
unknown
said
roger
clark
a
program
director
at
the
grand
canyon
trust
currently
the
global
uranium
market
is
so
flooded
that
mining
in
the
united
states
for
the
mineral
used
in
nuclear
power
plants
and
nuclear
weapons
is
not
profitable
but
that
could
change
as
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
is
considering
protections
on
the
mineral
that
could
increase
demand
for
domestically
mined
uranium
last
month
uranium
miner
energy
fuels
said
it
had
won
federal
approvals
to
expand
operations
at
two
mines
in
southeastern
utah
after
years
of
challenges
from
conservation
groups
worried
about
emissions
of
radon
gas
other
companies
have
urged
interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
to
reverse
the
ban

may
