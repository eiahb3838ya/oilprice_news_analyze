crisis

gregorio
sierra
a
psychologist
in
the
capital
bogota
it
s
duque
who
was
handpicked
by
former

projects
as
well
as

the
peace
accord
and
impose
tougher
punishments

former
farc
fighters
under
the
terms
of
the
deal
thousands
of
rebels
demobilized
and
the
group
is
now
a
political
party
but
the
accord
drew
ire
from
many
who
believe
the
farc
should
be
in
prison
and
not
in
congress
some
areas
abandoned
by
the
farc
have
suffered
an
increase
in
fighting

risen
sharply
stirring
concern
in
washington
the

also
coincides
with
a
growing
migration
crisis
from
neighboring
venezuela
colombia
is
appealing
for
international
support
to
cope
with
hundreds
of
thousands
of
venezuelans
streaming
across
the
border
to
flee
shortages
of
food
and
rising
crime

petro
a
combative
populist
who
was
once
a
member
of
the
now
defunct
rebel
group
supports
the
peace
deal
but
some
of
his
economic
policies
spook
investors
and
have
prompted
rivals
to
compare
him
to
former
venezuelan
president
hugo
chavez
he
has
promised
to
take
power
away
from
political
and
social
elites
he
says
have
stymied

and
to
carry
out
a
complete
economic
overhaul

shifted
voters
priorities
to
inequality
and
corruption
from
security
issues
opening
the
door
to
the
left
for
the
first
time
these
elections
may
realign
the
political
axis
to
a
more
ideological
right
versus
left
said
francisco
miranda
a
political
consultant
it
would
be
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
colombia
that
an
openly
leftist
leader
a
socialist
may
get
through
to
the
second
with
the
highest
rejection
rate
among
all
candidates
petro
is
highly
unlikely
to
win
amid
pitched
battles
on
social
media
between
voters
petro
said
that
voting
software
had
been
tampered
with
in
a
bid
to
help
vargas
reach
the
second
round
petro
called
on
his
followers
to
observe
vote
counting
and
may
call
for
protests
if
he
does
not
reach
the
during
his
tenure
as
mayor
of
bogota
he
was
briefly
ousted
over
a
trash
collection
scandal
and
led
massive
marches
calling
for
his
own
reinstatement
in
the
affluent
usaquen
neighborhood
of
the
capital
claudia
guerrero
a
shop
assistant
said
she
hoped
fellow
voters
did
not
just
hurl
insults
on
social
media
but
actually
went
to
the
polls
abstention
in
the
country
is
high
less
than
half
of
eligible
voters
tend
to
participate
in
elections
i
hope
many
young
people
vote
and
above
all
i
hope
the
losers
accept
the
results
