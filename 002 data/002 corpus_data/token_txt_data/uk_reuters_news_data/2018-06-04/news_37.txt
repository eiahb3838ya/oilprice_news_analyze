f
or
almost
a
year
a
clutch
of
bosnian
women
has
kept
watch
over
a
wooden
bridge
to
disrupt
the
march
of
hydropower
part
of
a
protest
against
the
damming
of
europe
s
wild
rivers
from
albania
to
slovenia
critics
fear
the
proposed
run
of
dams
will
destroy
their
majestic
landscape
steal
their
water
and
extinguish
species
unique
to
the
balkans
so
the
village
women
stake
out
the
bridge
around
the
clock
listening
out
for
the
telltale
sounds
of
diggers
on
the
move
we
are
always
here
during
the
day
at
night
always
said
hata
hurem
a
housewife
in
the
shadow
of
the
towering
mountains
that
dominate
the
balkan
landscape
clustered
by
a
creek
on
the
edge
of
the
village
of
kruscica
about
miles
north
west
of
sarajevo
the
local
women
have
taken
turns
to
stand
firm
blocking
trucks
and
scrapers
from
accessing
the
construction
sites
of
two
small
plants
investment
in
renewable
energy
is
growing
worldwide
as
countries
rush
to
meet
goals
set
by
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
but
from
china
to
south
america
dams
cause
controversy
for
flooding
fragile
ecosystems
and
displacing
local
communities
plans
to
build
almost
hydropower
plants
were
underway
across
the
balkans
in
about
percent
of
them
in
bosnia
according
to
a
study
by
consultancy
fluvius
authorities
and
investors
say
boosting
hydropower
is
key
to
reducing
regional
dependency
on
coal
and
to
falling
in
line
with
european
union
energy
policies
as
western
balkan
states
move
towards
integration
with
the
bloc
the
energy
ministry
of
the
federation
of
bosnia
and
herzegovina
one
of
bosnia
s
two
autonomous
regions
where
kruscica
is
located
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
the
government
of
bosnia
s
other
region
republika
srpska
said
building
dams
was
easier
and
cheaper
than
shifting
towards
other
power
sources
the
republic
of
srpska
has
comparative
advantages
in
its
unused
hydro
potential
and
considers
it
quite
justified
to
achieve
the
goals
set
by
the
eu
by
exploiting
its
unused
hydropower
said
energy
ministry
spokeswoman
zorana
kisic
yet
critics
say
the
dam
tsunami
a
term
coined
by
activists
endangers
europe
s
last
wild
rivers
which
flow
free
if
rivers
stop
running
freely
they
say
dozens
of
species
from
the
danube
salmon
to
the
balkan
lynx
are
at
risk
about
a
third
of
the
planned
dam
projects
are
in
protected
areas
including
some
in
national
parks
according
to
the
study
commissioned
by
campaign
groups
riverwatch
and
euronatur
most
plants
are
small
producing
as
little
as
up
to
mw
each
roughly
enough
to
power
about
homes
but
their
combined
impact
is
large
as
activists
say
they
would
cut
fish
migration
routes
and
damage
their
habitat
three
thousand
hydropower
plants
will
destroy
these
rivers
said
viktor
bjelić
of
the
center
for
environment
czzs
a
bosnian
environmental
group
many
of
the
species
depending
on
these
ecosystem
will
disappear
or
will
be
extremely
some
local
communities
fear
displacement
and
lost
access
to
water
they
ve
long
used
for
drinking
fishing
and
farming
in
kruscica
protesters
say
water
would
be
diverted
through
pipelines
leaving
the
creek
empty
and
sinking
hopes
for
a
revival
of
nature
tourism
that
attracted
hikers
hunters
and
fishing
enthusiasts
before
war
intervened
in
the
the
river
means
everything
to
us
it
s
the
life
of
the
community
said
kruscica
s
mayor
tahira
tibold
speaking
outside
the
barren
wooden
hut
used
as
base
by
demonstrators
locals
first
heard
about
the
plants
when
construction
workers
showed
up
last
year
added
the
women
have
led
protests
since
fronting
a
picket
to
shield
men
during
a
confrontation
with
police
last
year
said
tibold
campaigners
have
taken
their
plight
to
court
alleging
irregularities
in
the
approval
process
and
works
have
stalled
but
demonstrators
keep
patrolling
around
the
clock
said
bjelić
of
czzs
as
it
is
not
known
when
or
how
the
case
will
end
the
protest
was
backed
by
clothing
company
patagonia
as
part
of
a
wider
campaign
to
preserve
balkan
rivers
and
dissuade
international
banks
from
investing
in
hydropower
banks
and
multilateral
investors
including
the
european
investment
bank
eib
the
european
bank
for
reconstruction
and
development
ebrd
and
the
world
bank
s
international
finance
corporation
ifc
fund
hundreds
of
projects
according
to
a
study
by
bankwatch
a
financial
watchdog
it
s
a
waste
of
money
and
a
moral
travesty
that
some
of
the
world
s
largest
financial
institutions
have
embraced
this
and
exploitative
technology
patagonia
founder
yvon
chouinard
said
in
a
statement
in
april
the
world
bank
ebrd
and
eib
said
their
investments
have
to
comply
with
environmental
and
social
standards
which
ebrd
and
eib
said
they
were
strengthening
ebrd
said
it
also
improved
its
assessment
process
and
pulled
out
of
some
projects
near
protected
areas
hydropower
is
an
important
source
of
renewable
energy
for
western
balkans
said
ebrd
s
spokeswoman
svitlana
pyrkalo
bosnia
gets
percent
of
its
electricity
from
hydropower
the
rest
from
power
plants
it
plans
to
increase
the
share
of
renewables
to
percent
by
under
a
target
agreed
with
the
eu
dams
are
generally
considered
more
reliable
than
wind
and
solar
plants
as
they
are
less
dependent
on
weather
conditions
but
that
could
change
with
global
warming
if
droughts
and
floods
grow
more
common
said
doug
vine
a
senior
fellow
at
the
center
for
climate
and
energy
solutions
a
think
tank
last
year
a
long
drought
lowered
water
levels
across
the
western
balkans
hitting
hydropower
output
and
driving
up
prices
campaigners
say
balkan
states
should
focus
on
solar
and
wind
power
as
they
involve
less
building
works
and
cost
less
just
because
it
doesn
t
emit
it
doesn
t
mean
it
s
good
said
ulrich
eichelmann
head
of
riverwatch
is
like
saying
that
smoking
is
healthy
because
it
doesn
t
affect
the
liver
