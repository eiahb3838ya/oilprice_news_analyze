it
had
started
commercial
operations
at
a
pioneering
floating

flng
production
platform
in
cameroon
million
under
budget
it
is
the
first
flng
vessel
of
its
kind
and
is
likely
to
boost
demand
for
golar
s
technology
in
africa
and
beyond
the
hilli
episeyo
flng
vessel
converted
from
an
ageing
tanker
for
billion
produced
the
first
lng
on
march
but
only
exported
its
first
cargo
in
may
to
china
after
technical
issues
delayed
a
ramp
up
in
production
after
continuously
producing

golar
s
project
clients
have
contractually
accepted
the
facility
marking
its
commercial
start
golar
said
in
a
statement
golar
is
in
talks
to
develop
similar
projects
in
with
bp
and
with
ophir
energy
in
equatorial
guinea
the
successful
removes
uncertainty
about
the
risks
associated
with
squeezing
a
liquefaction
plant
typically
spanning
hundreds
of
acres
on
land
into
a
single
ship
with
four
liquefaction
units
bolted
onto
its
sides
trading
companies
and
oil
majors
are
keen
on
the
technology
for
its
relatively
low
cost
and
ability
to
unlock
stranded
reserves
beyond
the
reach
of
pipelines
developer
golar
provides
the
liquefaction
facility
and
services
under
a
production

with

firm

all
of
the
plant
s
million
tonne
annual
output
was
sold
via
a
competitive
tender
by
perenco
to
gazprom
marketing
trading
for
eight
years
in

statement
golar
lng
said
commercial
tolling
fees
will
add
about
million
to
its
earnings
before
interest
tax
depreciation
and
amortization
annually
plus
an
estimated
million
in
operating
cash
flow
based
on
current
oil
prices
all
told
the
hilly
episeyo
came
in
million
under
budget
golar
said
a
rarity
in
the
lng
industry
where
project
costs
routinely
balloon
billions
of
dollars
over
budget
