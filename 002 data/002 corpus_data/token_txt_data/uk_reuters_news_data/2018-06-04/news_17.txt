the
planned
exit
of
bhp
billiton
ltd
from
its
shale
business
has
drawn
oil
companies
and
private
equity
firms
into
a
competition
that
may
have
no
clear
winner
until
late
this
year
or
early
next
year
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
negotiations
bhp
the
world
s
largest
miner
said
in
august
that
it
would
exit
its
shale
oil
and
gas
business
after
pressure
from
activist
hedge
fund
elliott
management
which
owns
a
stake
in
the
company
and
argued
the
unit
was
a
drag
on
bhp
s
value
the
company
s
bhp
petroleum
unit
holds
more
than
acres
spread
across
four
shale
plays
texas
permian
and
eagle
ford
basins
and
the
haynesville
and
fayetteville
formations
of
arkansas
a
divestiture
of
all
of
that
land
would
be
among
the
largest
shale
acreage
sales
to
date
bhp
is
offering
to
sell
off
acreage
in
seven
different
packages
spanning
three
formations
it
has
generated
interest
from
oil
companies
that
paired
with
private
equity
firms
to
bid
on
all
the
assets
as
well
as
from
companies
looking
at
individual
packages
first
bids
were
received
last
week
but
no
deal
is
expected
until
very
late
in
or
early
according
to
two
of
the
people
familiar
with
the
matter
who
like
all
the
sources
could
not
speak
for
attribution
as
the
negotiations
are
not
public
it
was
currently
unclear
whether
bhp
may
hold
a
second
bid
round
with
certain
bidders
or
all
of
them
or
it
may
opt
to
continue
weighing
the
received
bids
toward
securing
a
preferred
deal
the
long
delay
can
be
explained
by
the
sheer
scale
of
the
process
and
the
number
of
parties
involved
although
bankers
have
also
been
critical
of
bhp
s
approach
which
has
been
regarded
as
throughout
bidders
include
consortiums
of
royal
dutch
shell
plc
and
blackstone
group
lp
advised
by
jefferies
and
chevron
corp
partnered
with
warburg
pincus
the
people
familiar
with
the
matter
said
apollo
global
management
llc
is
bidding
solo
while
bp
plc
chief
executive
bob
dudley
told
reuters
last
month
that
it
could
place
a
bid
a
bhp
spokeswoman
declined
to
comment
on
the
details
of
the
sale
however
chief
executive
officer
andrew
mackenzie
said
at
a
conference
in
florida
last
month
that
there
was
encouraging
interest
from
potential
bidders
and
that
the
higher
oil
prices
and
lower
corporate
tax
rates
than
when
the
plan
was
first
announced
last
summer
were
supporting
the
process
bp
shell
chevron
blackstone
and
warburg
pincus
declined
to
comment
apollo
did
not
respond
to
a
comment
request
bhp
values
the
entirety
of
the
acreage
at
billion
but
analysts
have
pegged
the
total
value
of
the
assets
lower
at
a
maximum
of
billion
bidding
in
consortiums
would
allow
the
integrated
oil
companies
to
focus
on
acreage
that
complemented
their
holdings
such
as
that
in
the
permian
while
the
private
equity
firms
would
take
on
acreage
in
the
haynesville
formation
the
acreage
includes
holdings
that
bhp
acquired
in
its
billion
takeover
of
petrohawk
energy
in
as
appetite
for
shale
gas
assets
reached
fever
pitch
shale
gas
assets
have
lost
value
as
natural
gas
prices
fell
from
about
in
mid
to
a
low
of
in
prices
have
since
recovered
to
about
per
mmbtu
buyout
houses
are
also
dominant
in
the
sale
process
for
the
gassy
fayetteville
assets
the
bid
deadline
for
which
was
in
late
april
having
been
marketed
separately
from
the
rest
of
bhp
s
shale
portfolio
barclays
plc
and
bank
of
lynch
are
running
the
sale
process
citigroup
and
goldman
sachs
had
also
helped
bhp
research
the
potential
of
the
unit
into
a
new
company
should
divestment
prove
unachievable
