to

despite
vows
to
end
fossil

subsidies
by

by

a
study
led
by

insitute
odi
found
they
spent
at
least
billion
a
year
to
support
fossil
fuels
at
home
and
abroad
in
and
governments
often
say
they
have
no
public
resources
to
support
the
clean
energy
transition
the
study
s
lead
author
shelagh
whitley
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
what
we
re
trying
to
do
is
highlight
that
those
resources
are
there
but
it
is
being
used
inefficiently
the
have
pledged
to
phase
out
fossil
fuel
subsidies
but
they
don
t
have
any
systems
in
terms
of
accountability
to
meet
the
pledges
they
don
t
have
road
maps
or
plans

followed
by
germany
canada
and
the

the

said
the
united

with
out

change

committed
nations
to
curbing
greenhouse

and
keeping
the
