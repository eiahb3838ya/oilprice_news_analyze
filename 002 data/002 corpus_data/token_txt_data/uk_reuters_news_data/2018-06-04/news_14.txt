a
tsunami
of
crude
oil
should
be
headed
toward
asia
according
to
pricing
on
futures
exchanges
but
the
reality
in
the
physical
market
tells
a
somewhat
different
story
the
discount
in
the
futures
markets
of
the
main
light
crude
grade
west
texas
intermediate
wti
to
the
global
benchmark
brent
crude
stood
at
a
barrel
on
june
the
widest
in
more
than
three
years
and
it
s
not
just
a
aberration
with
wti
s
discount
to
brent
for
crude
for
delivery
in
six
months
at
a
barrel
on
june
the
most
since
september
the
pricing
of
wti
and
brent
suggest
that
crude
is
now
so
cheap
compared
to
its
main
competitor
that
refiners
across
the
world
but
especially
in
the
main
consuming
region
of
asia
should
be
snapping
up
vast
quantities
there
is
some
evidence
to
suggest
that
this
has
happened
in
recent
weeks
with
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
oil
research
and
forecasts
pointing
to
record
arrivals
of
crude
in
asia
in
june
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
is
expected
to
land
at
asian
ports
in
june
up
from
bpd
in
may
which
was
the
previous
high
for
crude
exports
to
asia
while
there
may
be
scope
for
exports
to
push
higher
in
coming
months
they
will
probably
be
limited
by
both
infrastructure
constraints
and
a
weakening
of
the
economics
while
the
paper
futures
market
makes
a
compelling
case
for
crude
exports
pricing
in
the
physical
markets
is
far
less
convincing
the
price
of
wti
crude
at
houston
as
assessed
by
argus
media
was
a
barrel
on
june
a
premium
of
a
barrel
or
percent
to
wti
futures
on
the
new
york
mercantile
exchange
that
means
an
asian
buyer
of
physical
wti
crude
for
loading
in
texas
is
paying
quite
a
significant
premium
over
the
price
of
paper
oil
in
the
futures
market
the
premium
has
risen
sharply
in
recent
weeks
given
that
it
was
closer
to
a
barrel
at
the
end
of
april
further
out
along
the
curve
also
shows
a
widening
premium
for
physical
wti
crude
over
the
futures
with
december
houston
wti
being
a
barrel
more
expensive
than
the
equivalent
futures
contract
as
at
the
end
of
may
while
physical
wti
crude
is
currently
at
a
strong
premium
to
the
futures
the
opposite
is
the
case
when
comparing
paper
brent
crude
to
the
prices
of
similar
physical
grades
brent
futures
closed
at
a
barrel
on
june
above
the
for
nigeria
s
bonny
light
and
the
for
angola
s
girassol
grade
putting
the
numbers
together
shows
that
an
asian
refiner
seeking
light
sweet
crude
could
have
on
june
bought
a
cargo
from
angola
at
just
cents
a
barrel
more
than
one
from
houston
this
small
advantage
in
favour
of
wti
from
houston
would
more
than
likely
be
eaten
up
by
the
increase
in
shipping
costs
given
that
texas
is
a
far
longer
voyage
to
asia
than
is
angola
overall
the
seemingly
huge
advantage
that
wti
enjoys
over
crudes
priced
against
brent
disappears
once
you
make
the
jump
from
the
paper
to
the
physical
markets
while
arbitrage
investors
may
enjoy
such
a
situation
the
current
pricing
of
physical
crude
oil
suggests
that
shipments
to
asia
may
struggle
to
be
competitive
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
one
side
issue
worth
mentioning
is
the
potential
impact
of
geopolitical
concerns
if
china
and
the
united
states
do
manage
to
reach
some
kind
of
trade
consensus
it
may
encourage
chinese
buying
of
crude
even
if
it
doesn
t
necessarily
make
economic
sense
on
the
other
hand
an
escalating
trade
dispute
may
see
china
s
refiners
take
less
crude
and
so
far
it
s
far
from
certain
which
is
the
more
likely
of
those
two
outcomes
