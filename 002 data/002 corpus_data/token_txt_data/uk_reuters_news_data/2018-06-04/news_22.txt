airlines adjusting hedges, fares, capacity and fleet as oil price jumps
sydney
reuters
airlines
are
locking
in
fuel
hedges
lowering
capacity
raising
fares
and
retiring
older
jets
to
cope
with
rising
costs
alongside
the
highest
oil
prices
since
industry
executives
say
the
squeeze
from
fuel
costs
which
have
risen
much
faster
than
ticket
prices
poses
a
particular
threat
to
the
industry
s
profitability
the
international
air
transport
association
on
monday
forecast
airlines
combined
profits
would
be
percent
lower
than
it
had
expected
in
december
at
billion
in
total
in
large
part
because
of
costlier
fuel
brent
crude
is
trading
at
around
a
barrel
up
nearly
percent
from
a
year
ago
at
this
point
with
rising
fuel
you
control
costs
raise
prices
and
you
may
have
some
fall
off
in
demand
and
reduce
capacity

zealand
chief
executive
christopher
luxon
told
reuters
on
monday
i
think
we
are
seeing
pricing
move
up
internationally
and
certainly
yields
come
up
as
well
he
added
iata
forecast
passenger
yields
a
proxy
for
airfares
will
rise
by
percent
this
year
in
the
first
annual
gains
since
as
airlines
look
to
recoup
rising
costs
american
airlines
ceo
doug
parker
also
forecast
that
fares
could
rise
as
capacity
is
reined
in
amid
higher
oil
prices
china
eastern
airlines
corp
ltd
has
said
it
would
consider
using
newly
launched
oil
futures
to
hedge
oil
for
the
first
time
in
a
decade
but
others
like
emirates
and
delta
air
lines
have
no
plans
to
return
to
hedging
as
a
result
of
the
recent
oil
price
increases
i
think
rushing
to
get
hedged
when
the
prices
go
up
is
a
bit
dumb
and
when
they
go
down
they
get
complacent
again
capa
centre
for
aviation
executive
chairman
peter
harbison
said
iata
chief
economist
brian
pearce
said
hedging
only
delays
the
impact
it
stabilizes
earnings
it
doesn
t
stop
the
rising
costs
happening
he
said
other
carriers
such
as
singapore
airlines
ltd
and
air
new
zealand
ltd
are
at
lower
prices
but
are
being
forced
to
hedge
at
higher
prices
as
those
contracts
end
in
keeping
with
their
internal
policies
for
example
iag
the
parent
of
british
airways
hedges
up
to
three
years
in
advance
on
a
rolling
basis
that
means
percent
of
its
fuel
is
hedged
for
the
current
first
three
months
a
number
that
drops
to
percent
in
the
final
quarter
of
the
period
whilst
most
of
us
have
hedging
in
place
that
hedging
eventually
runs
out
or
gets
replaced
by
new
positions
you
have
got
and
it
is
a
question
then
of
what
do
you
do
virgin
australia
holdings
ltd
ceo
john
borghetti
said
if
you
look
at
history
typically
some
of
that
cost
has
to
be
passed
on
at
some
point
because
you
just
simply
can
t
absorb
european
carriers
are
also
hedged
between
and
percent
as
a
way
to
give
them
better
control
of
costs
we
take
a
simple
view
that
hedging
is
about
buying
time
it
gives
you
time
to
address
volatility
said
iag
s
chief
executive
willie
walsh
the
higher
oil
price
is
also
expected
to
drive
a
new
cycle
of
airlines
replacing
older
jets
with
more
efficient
newer
generation
models
like
the
and
max
narrowbodies
and
the
and
widebodies
australia
s
qantas
airways
ltd
is
retiring
boeing
co
more
quickly
than
it
had
originally
forecast
and
replacing
them
with
it
will
be
a
bittersweet
moment
when
those
aircraft
will
go
but
it
also
helps
us
manage
the
increase
in
fuel
prices
qantas
ceo
alan
joyce
said
monday
the
are
going
to
give
us
a
big
benefit
this
year
on
our
international
boeing
commercial
airplanes
vice
president
of
marketing
randy
tinseth
said
on
sunday
that
replacement
makes
sense
for
airlines
when
oil
reaches
a
barrel
fuel
is
definitely
an
issue
and
it
is
eating
into
profitability
said
mylene
scholnick
principal
at
consultancy
icf
when
fuel
comes
down
the
airlines
keep
aircraft
longer
so
we
had
seen
ages
pushed
to
years
now
with
fuel
back
up
it
won
t
bring
down
the
retirement
age
drastically
but
will
stabilize
it
at
around
