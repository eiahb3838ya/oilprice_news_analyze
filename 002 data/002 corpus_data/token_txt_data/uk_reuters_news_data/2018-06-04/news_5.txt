update 1-u.s. black lung fund will need taxpayer bailout if coal tax falls -gao
washington
reuters
a
federal
fund
to
help
coal
miners
disabled
by
black
lung
disease
will
require
a
taxpayer
bailout
if
congress
does
not
extend
or
increase
the
tax
on
coal
production
that
funds
it
according
to
a
government
report
on
monday
coal
companies
are
currently
required
to
pay
a
per
ton
tax
on
underground
coal
production
to
finance
the
federal
black
lung
disability
trust
fund
which
pays
medical
and
living
expenses
for
eligible
miners
but
that
amount
is
scheduled
to
revert
to
the
level
of
cents
with
the
scheduled
tax
rate
decrease
our
moderate
case
simulation
suggests
that
expected
revenue
will
likely
be
insufficient
to
cover
combined
black
lung
benefit
payments
and
administrative
costs
as
well
as
debt
repayment
expenditures
according
to
the
report
from
the
government
accountability
office
cases
of
black
lung
an
incurable
illness
caused
by
inhaling
coal
dust
are
rising
to
levels
not
seen
in
decades
as
miners
plumb
the
depths
of
coal
seams
using
heavy
blasting
equipment
according
to
government
health
officials
the
fund
that
helps
them
is
already
roughly
billion
in
debt
as
revenue
since
it
was
created
in
the
has
failed
to
keep
up
with
outflows
that
debt
could
balloon
to
billion
by
without
congressional
action
the
gao
report
said
the
gao
offered
three
options
to
improve
the
solvency
of
the
fund
extend
the
current
excise
tax
rate
to
reduce
the
debt
to
billion
debt
by
increase
the
current
tax
rate
by
approximately
percent
to
eliminate
the
debt
entirely
by
or
allow
the
tax
rate
to
sunset
as
scheduled
cancel
the
current
debt
and
appropriate
billion
to
the
fund
that
third
option
would
amount
to
a
transfer
of
liability
for
black
lung
victims
from
coal
companies
to
taxpayers
the
coal
industry
has
been
lobbying
hard
against
the
tax
arguing
its
payments
have
already
been
too
high
at
a
difficult
time
for
mining
companies
and
that
the
fund
has
been
abused
by
undeserving
applicants
such
as
smokers
ashley
burke
spokeswoman
for
the
national
mining
association
rejected
the
idea
the
tax
should
be
increased
there
is
no
need
for
a
tax
increase
on
the
coal
industry
the
only
reason
borrowing
has
been
necessary
is
for
the
government
to
essentially
repay
itself
for
accumulated
interest
payments
on
legacy
debt
from
the
and
she
said
a
bipartisan
effort
by
lawmakers
to
extend
the
current
coal
tax
failed
earlier
this
year
after
the
coal
industry
lobbied
republican
house
leadership
not
to
take
it
up
democratic
representatives
bobby
scott
of
virginia
and
sander
levin
of
michigan
requested
the
gao
study
in
to
clarify
the
fund
s
financial
condition
scott
told
reuters
the
report
should
compel
congress
to
take
action
to
extend
or
increase
the
coal
excise
tax
the
existing
black
lung
excise
tax
rate
on
coal
companies
is
imperative
to
the
solvency
of
the
trust
fund
scott
said
in
a
statement
the
fund
currently
provides
medical
coverage
and
monthly
payments
for
living
expenses
to
more
than
people
the
trump
administration
has
not
yet
weighed
in
on
the
potential
insolvency
of
the
fund
making
future
policy
options
to
address
the
debt
uncertain
scott
said
the
united
mineworkers
union
of
america
the
coal
miners
trade
union
called
on
congress
to
ensure
that
the
excise
tax
coal
companies
now
pay
remains
at
current
levels
especially
as
the
incidence
of
the
disease
continues
to
rise
and
affect
younger
miners
this
is
a
problem
that
has
been
created
by
the
coal
industry
there
is
a
system
to
help
the
victims
of
this
disease
already
in
place
that
the
coal
industry
pays
for
and
i
see
no
reason
why
we
would
put
the
taxpayers
on
the
hook
instead
