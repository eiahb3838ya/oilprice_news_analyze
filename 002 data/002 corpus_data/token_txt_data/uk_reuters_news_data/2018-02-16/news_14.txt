reuters
independent
refiner
andeavor
said
on
friday
it
plans
to
run
its
refineries
up
to
percent
of
their
combined
capacity
of
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
company
also
said
during
a
conference
call
with
wall
street
analysts
that
its
refineries
ran
at
percent
of
their
combined
crude
oil
throughput
capacity
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
for
all
of
the
refineries
operated
at
percent
of
combined
throughput
andeavor
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
gregory
goff
said
the
company
has
a
heavy
overhaul
schedule
for
we
are
in
the
final
stages
of
completing
a
turnaround
at
los
angeles
that
we
started
some
time
ago
and
we
are
doing
a
turnaround
at
martinez
goff
said
so
we
have
a
very
heavy
turnaround
year
but
everything
is
going
andeavor
is
integrating
refineries
into
a
single
plant
in
carson
and
wilmington
california
adjacent
industrial
suburbs
of
los
angeles
the
bpd
carson
refinery
and
the
bpd
wilmington
refinery
adjoin
each
other
andeavor
chief
financial
officer
steven
sterin
said
the
heavy
schedule
for
refinery
maintenance
would
continue
into
in
part
to
prepare
for
a
change
in
marine
fuel
formulation
to
lower
sulfur
content
from
percent
to
percent
we
are
managing
our
turnarounds
to
have
very
very
little
turnarounds
in
sterin
said
so
our
and
plans
include
preparation
for
being
able
to
supply
the
needs
of
the
market
in
for
the
diesel
fuel
that
we
expect
to
goff
said
andeavor
sees
no
alternative
to
its
stymied
proposal
to
build
a
crude
oil
terminal
that
would
transfer
million
barrels
of
oil
a
month
from
trains
to
tankers
at
the
port
of
vancouver
washington
governor
jay
inslee
a
democrat
on
approved
a
state
board
s
recommendation
denying
andeavor
a
permit
to
build
the
vancouver
energy
center
we
continue
to
scour
all
ideas
and
all
that
but
we
don
t
have
any
immediate
plans
to
do
anything
differently
goff
said
the
vancouver
energy
project
was
very
attractive
primarily
because
it
allows
you
to
take
crude
produced
in
the
united
states
with
a
lower
carbon
intensity
of
other
crudes
that
are
run
by
the
industry
on
the
west
coast
and
run
those
crudes
and
basically
improve
the
environmental
footprint
of
the
fuels
that
we
supply
on
the
west
coast
he
said
in
december
washington
energy
facility
site
evaluation
council
unanimously
recommended
denying
andeavor
and
partner
savage
cos
a
permit
to
build
the
million
center
citing
risk
of
injury
to
workers
and
damage
to
the
environment
if
the
center
went
into
operation
andeavor
took
a
million
asset
impairment
charge
in
the
fourth
quarter
