beirut

lebanon
s
hezbollah
said
on
friday
the
united
states
must
accept
the
lebanese
government
s
demands
over
border
disputes
with
israel
and
vowed
it
was
ready
to
act
against
israel
if
necessary
diplomats
have
been
mediating
between
the
two
countries
after
a
surge
in
tensions
over
a
border
wall
which
israel
is
building
and
lebanon
s
decision
to
explore
for
offshore
energy
near
disputed
waters
earlier
on
friday
parliament
speaker
nabih
berri
told
a
envoy
that
lebanon
rejects
current
proposals
over
the
marine
border
with
israel
the
state
must
have
a
strong
and
firm
position
said
sayyed
hassan
nasrallah
the
leader
of
the
political
and
military
movement
in
a
televised
speech
at
a
rally
if
the
americans
come
and
say
you
must
be
responsive
so
that
i
restrain
israel
from
you
tell
the
americans
they
must
accept
lebanon
s
demands
so
that
we
hold
hezbollah
back
from
israel
he
added
nasrallah
said
the
main
issue
currently
at
stake
was
lebanon
s
maritime
borders
in
the
oil
and
gas
battle
the
only
power
the
lebanese
have
is
the
resistance
he
said
in
a
reference
to
the
heavily
armed
shi
ite
muslim
hezbollah
the
lebanese
army
could
not
stop
israel
in
this
matter
he
said
because
the
united
states
israel
s
key
ally
and
also
a
key
supporter
of
lebanon
s
military
would
stand
in
its
way
if
lebanon
s
higher
defence
council
were
to
decide
that
israeli
offshore
oil
and
gas
plants
should
be
forbidden
from
working
i
promise
they
would
stop
working
within
hours
he
said
nasrallah

in
a
televised
address
at
a
rally
commemorating
senior
commanders
including
former
military

imad
moughniyah

was
formed
in
the
as
a
resistance
movement
against
israel
s
occupation
of
southern
lebanon
and
the
two
remain
bitter
enemies
there
has
been
no
major
conflict
between
them
since
a
war
in
in
recent
years
israeli
jets
have
repeatedly
struck
hezbollah
