update 2-allianz considers group's stance on coal insurance
munich
reuters
germany
s
allianz
is
considering
whether
to
stop
insuring
new
coal
power
plants
but
told
environmental
campaigners
it
would
stay
in
the
business
for
now
the
percent
slide
in
earnings
reported
by
the
insurer
on
friday
brought
into
sharp
focus
the
debate
raging
within
its
munich
headquarters
over
how
to
balance
the
need
to
maximize
profit
with
the
desire
to
address
environmental
concerns
the
company
has
put
together
a
working
group
to
study
the
issue
of
insuring
new
coal
plants
a
spokeswoman
said
on
friday
with
a
decision
expected
in
late
april
or
early
may
allianz
s
chief
executive
oliver
baete
was
a
leader
in
a
drive
to
exit
coal
investments
several
years
ago
a
significant
move
by
one
of
europe
s
largest
investors
it
s
not
a
question
of
if
but
rather
a
question
of
when
and
how
to
manage
the
transition
from
coal
said
a
source
familiar
with
baete
s
thinking
environmental
campaign
group
unfriend
coal
last
week
published
a
scathing
report
that
highlighted
allianz
s
leadership
of
a
consortium
underwriting
a
large
power
plant
under
construction
in
poland
allianz
which
got
out
of
the
business
of
investing
in
coal
in
said
it
would
continue
to
offer
insurance
for
the
energy
industry
for
the
time
being
the
most
important
point
for
us
is
various
countries
have
an
energy
need
that
needs
to
be
fulfilled
they
need
to
be
insured
said
board
member
guenther
thallinger
we
believe
that
with
dialogue
with
various
companies
over
time
we
can
hopefully
work
down
to
a
much
lower
level
of
coal
he
said
campaigners
remain
unhappy
with
allianz
s
stance
allianz
is
still
blind
to
the
contradiction
between
its
ambition
to
be
a
climate
champion
and
its
support
for
coal
and
its
new
policies
will
do
little
to
protect
the
climate
regine
richter
energy
and
finance
campaigner
at
urgewald
said
on
friday
the
company
earlier
posted
a
worse
than
expected
net
profit
of
billion
euros
billion
hit
by
a
tax
overhaul
a
weak
dollar
and
a
spate
of
natural
disasters
analysts
had
forecast
net
profit
of
billion
euros
in
a
reuters
poll
was
an
especially
difficult
year
for
our
industry
baete
said
for
the
full
year
allianz
posted
operating
profit
of
billion
euros
in
line
with
analysts
expectations
of
billion
and
the
company
s
own
target
allianz
forecast
that
profit
would
be
little
changed
in
last
year
insurers
had
to
pay
record
claims
of
about
billion
after
a
spate
of
hurricanes
earthquakes
and
fires
in
north
america
the
series
of
natural
disasters
has
rocked
the
insurance
industry
after
years
of
muted
losses
compounding
pressure
from
low
prices
caused
by
fierce
competition
and
low
interest
rates
allianz
which
is
sitting
on
a
cash
hoard
and
has
been
buying
back
shares
said
it
would
increase
its
annual
dividend
to
euros
per
share
up
from
in
euros
