the
dollar
on
the
other
hand
was
fragile
with
its
index
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
on
the
verge
of
sliding
to
the
lowest
since
late
the
dollar
index
stood
at
just
above
its
low
of
set
on
while
there
is
no
strong
consensus
yet
on
what
is
driving
the
dollar
s
weakness
many
point
to
worries
president
donald
trump
s
tax
cuts
and
fiscal
spending
could
stoke
future
inflation
and
erode
the
value
of
the
dollar
his
protectionist
policies
could
also
fan
inflation
markets
appear
to
have
calmed
down
for
now
but
fundamentally
it
is
different
from
last
year
said

global

strategist

management
you
could
say
that
right
now
rather
than
stocks
rising
around
the
world
it
is

almost
everything

hit
a

the

thursday
on
hopes
the
resignation
of
president
jacob
zuma
had
paved
the
way
for
new
leaders
to
speed
up
economic
growth
the
dollar
s
fall
came
even
as
bond
yields
remained
near
a
high
the
treasuries
yield
hit
a
peak
of
percent
on
thursday
and
last
stood
at
percent
yields
also
rose
as
investors
grew
convinced
that
the
correction
in
stock
prices
in
recent
weeks
would
not
prevent
the
fed
from
raising
interest
rates
in
march
