world
shares
were
set
for
their
best
week
of
gains
in
six
years
on
friday
after
two
consecutive
weeks
in
the
red
shrugging
off
a
rise
in
global
borrowing
costs
while
the
dollar
hit
its
lowest
since
msci
s
world
index
of
stocks
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
was
up
percent
after
european
bourses
opened
after
suffering
its
biggest
weekly
drop
since
august
last
week
the
index
is
now
on
track
for
its
best
showing
since
early
december
some
investors
have
been
puzzled
at
the
quick
rebound
which
has
coincided
with
a
rise
in
bond
yields
on
signs
that
inflation
is
starting
to
creep
up
globally
the
argument
commonly
offered
by
economists
has
been
that
historically
it
is
not
unusual
for
stocks
and
bond
market
borrowing
costs
to
rise
in
tandem
in
a
rapidly
expanding
economy
for
me
it
s
really
a
question
of
maybe
markets
are
taking
a
look
at
the
inflationary
outlook
and
saying
ok
maybe
rates
are
going
up
and
maybe
the
economy
will
compensate
for
that
said
michael
hewson
chief
markets
analyst
at
cmc
markets
that
might
change
if
we
move
to
percent
on
the
treasury
yield
the
global
rise
in
borrowing
costs
has
been
led
by
that
instrument
which
hit
a
high
of
percent
this
week
it
stood
at
percent
on
friday
yields
across
the
euro
area
were
mostly
steady
although
germany
s
benchmark
bund
was
within
sight
of
highs
and
set
for
its
biggest
weekly
rise
in
eight
weeks
investors
were
also
watching
for
a
sovereign
debt
rating
update
on
greece
from
fitch
set
for
release
later
in
the
day
european
shares
were
also
set
to
chalk
up
healthy
weekly
gains
snapping
a
losing
streak
as
earnings
updates
continued
to
impress
and
volatility
and
jitters
over
rising
inflation
eased
among
country
benchmarks
the
uk
s
ftse
was
up
percent
and
germany
s
dax
added
percent
while
italy
s
ftse
mib
was
up
percent
the
benchmark
is
up
percent
so
far
this
week
set
for
its
best
week
since
december
but
still
down
around
percent
from
the
peak
it
hit
in
january
with
many
asian
markets
closed
on
friday
for
the
lunar
new
year
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
rose
percent
japan
s
nikkei
rose
percent
with
investors
relieved
to
see
the
government
appoint
bank
of
japan
governor
haruhiko
kuroda
for
another
term
suggesting
the
central
bank
will
be
in
no
rush
to
dial
back
its
massive
stimulus
programme
equity
investors
have
drawn
a
degree
of
reassurance
from
a
fall
in
the
vix
index
a
measure
of
implied
volatility
on
the
s
p
index
also
known
as
wall
street
s
fear
gauge
the
index
dropped
below
for
the
first
time
since
it
spiked
to
a
high
of
last
week
a
jump
that
caused
massive
losses
among
investors
who
bet
equity
markets
would
stay
stable
on
a
combination
of
solid
economic
growth
and
moderate
inflation
while
the
goldilocks
risk
environment
from
january
appears
to
be
fading
we
do
not
believe
we
are
on
the
cusp
of
a
protracted
risk
because
the
global
growth
cycle
remains
strong
in
our
view

agricole
strategists
said
in
a
note
to
clients
extending
the
previous
day
s
losses
the
dollar
s
index
against
a
group
of
six
major
currencies
fell
to
the
lowest
since
december
the
index
was
on
track
to
lose
around
percent
on
the
week
in
its
largest
decline
since
february
against
the
yen
the
greenback
fell
to
its
lowest
in
over
a
year
there
is
no
strong
consensus
yet
on
what
is
driving
the
dollar
s
persistent
weakness
especially
in
light
of
rising
yields
some
say
it
simply
reflects
a
return
of
risk
appetite
and
a
shift
to
currencies
including
many
emerging
market
ones
but
others
cite
concerns
that
washington
might
pursue
a
weak
dollar
strategy
as
well
as
talk
that
foreign
central
banks
may
be
reallocating
their
reserves
out
of
the
dollar
there
are
also
worries
president
donald
trump
s
tax
cuts
and
fiscal
spending
could
stoke
inflation
and
erode
the
currency
s
value
you
could
say
that
right
now
rather
than
stocks
rising
around
the
world
it
is
the
dollar
falling
against
almost
everything
