world
shares
were
set
to
post
their
best
week
of
gains
in
six
years
on
friday
after
two
consecutive
weeks
spent
in
the
red
shrugging
off
a
rise
in
global
borrowing
costs
while
the
dollar
hit
its
lowest
level
since
the
msci
world
index
of
stocks
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
was
up
percent
after
european
bourses
opened
after
suffering
its
biggest
weekly
drop
since
august
last
week
this
week
s
recovery
puts
the
index
on
track
for
its
best
weekly
showing
since
early
december
the
index
has
now
reclaimed
more
than
half
of
the
percent
plunge
from
a
record
intraday
high
on
to
a
intraday
low
a
week
ago
investors
have
been
puzzled
at
this
week
s
quick
rebound
in
stock
markets
which
has
also
coincided
with
a
rise
in
bond
yields
on
evidence
that
inflation
is
starting
to
creep
up
globally
the
argument
most
commonly
offered
by
economists
has
been
that
historically
it
s
not
unusual
for
stocks
and
bond
market
borrowing
costs
to
rise
in
tandem
with
a
rapidly
expanding
economy
for
me
it
s
really
a
question
of
maybe
markets
are
taking
a
look
at
the
inflationary
outlook
and
saying
ok
maybe
rates
are
going
up
and
maybe
the
economy
will
compensate
for
that
said
michael
hewson
chief
markets
analyst
at
cmc
markets
that
might
change
if
we
move
to
percent
on
the
treasury
the
global
rise
in
borrowing
costs
has
been
led
by
the
treasury
which
hit
a
high
of
percent
this
week
it
last
stood
at
percent
yields
across
the
euro
area
were
mostly
steady
although
germany
s
benchmark
bund
yield
was
within
sight
of
year
highs
and
set
for
its
biggest
weekly
rise
in
eight
weeks
investors
were
also
watching
for
a
sovereign
debt
rating
on
greece
from
fitch
ratings
set
for
release
later
in
the
day
european
shares
were
set
to
chalk
up
healthy
weekly
gains
snapping
a
losing
streak
as
earnings
updates
continued
to
impress
and
volatility
and
jitters
over
rising
inflation
eased
among
country
benchmarks
the
uk
s
ftse
was
up
percent
and
germany
s
dax
added
percent
while
italy
s
ftse
mib
outperformed
up
percent
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
rose
percent
though
many
asian
markets
were
closed
on
friday
for
the
lunar
new
year
japan
s
nikkei
rose
percent
with
investors
relieved
to
see
the
government
appoint
bank
of
japan
governor
haruhiko
kuroda
for
another
term
suggesting
the
central
bank
will
be
in
no
rush
to
dial
back
its
massive
stimulus
programme
the
benchmark
is
up
percent
so
far
this
week
set
for
its
best
week
since
december
but
still
down
around
percent
from
the
peak
it
hit
in
january
some
put
the
rebound
in
equities
down
to
investors
being
reassured
by
a
fall
in
the
vix
index
a
measure
of
implied
volatility
on
the
s
p
index
also
known
as
wall
street
s
fear
gauge
the
index
dropped
below
for
the
first
time
since
its
spike
to
a
high
of
last
week
a
jump
that
caused
massive
losses
among
investors
who
bet
equity
markets
would
be
stable
on
a
combination
of
solid
economic
growth
and
moderate
inflation
extending
the
previous
day
s
losses
the
dollar
s
index
against
a
group
of
six
major
currencies
fell
to
the
lowest
since
december
the
index
was
on
track
to
lose
around
percent
on
the
week
in
its
largest
decline
since
february
there
is
no
strong
consensus
yet
on
what
is
driving
the
dollar
s
persistent
weakness
especially
in
light
of
rising
yields
some
say
it
simply
reflects
a
return
of
risk
appetite
and
a
shift
to
currencies
including
many
emerging
market
ones
but
others
cite
concerns
that
washington
might
pursue
a
weak
dollar
strategy
as
well
as
talk
that
foreign
central
banks
may
be
reallocating
their
reserves
out
of
the
dollar
there
are
also
worries
president
donald
trump
s
tax
cuts
and
fiscal
spending
could
stoke
inflation
and
erode
the
value
of
the
dollar
his
protectionist
policies
could
also
fan
inflation
markets
appear
to
have
calmed
down
for
now
but
fundamentally
it
is
different
from
last
year
said
yoshinori
shigemi
global
market
strategist
at
jpmorgan
asset
management
you
could
say
that
right
now
rather
than
stocks
rising
around
the
world
it
is
the
dollar
falling
against
almost
everything
