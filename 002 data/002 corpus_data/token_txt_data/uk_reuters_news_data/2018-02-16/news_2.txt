in
history
on
march
for
areas
in
federal

off
the

less
than
a
year

s
america
first
offshore
energy
strategy
which
aims
to
reduce
energy
imports
and
boost
jobs
in
the
industry
but
offshore
drilling
is
expensive
in
a
time
of
relatively
low
oil
prices
held
in
check
partially
by
plentiful
supplies
of
onshore
petroleum
which
is
cheaper

a
tepid
response
from
