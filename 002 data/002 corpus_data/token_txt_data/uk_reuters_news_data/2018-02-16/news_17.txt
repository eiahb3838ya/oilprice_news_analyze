texas
senator
john
cornyn
s
plan
to
overhaul
biofuels
policy
faces
resistance
from
the
oil
and
ethanol
sectors
reducing
chances
of
a
reboot
to
the
controversial
regulations
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
the
plan
which
the
sources
said
could
be
released
as
draft
legislation
in
coming
weeks
represents
nearly
two
years
of
negotiations
with
the
rival
industries
to
end
their
ongoing
clash
over
the
future
of
the
renewable
fuel
standard
the
law
requires
refiners
to
cover
the
costs
of
mixing
increasing
volumes
of
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
fuel
supply
by
acquiring
blending
credits
called
rins
that
can
be
purchased
or
earned
while
the
regulation
has
created
a
lucrative
new
market
for
corn
growers
and
fuel
blenders
the
many
refiners
in
cornyn
s
home
state
of
texas
complain
the
system
has
cost
them
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
as
volumes
mandates
grow
and
credit
prices
trend
higher
the
centerpiece
of
the
cornyn
plan
includes
the
creation
of
a
new
type
of
ethanol
rin
credit
called
a
rin
that
the
republican
lawmaker
believes
would
lower
the
price
of
the
existing
ethanol
blending
credits
the
sources
said
a
rin
would
be
generated
when
a
gallon
of
gasoline
containing
more
than
percent
ethanol
is
produced
the
existing
rin
pool
would
then
cover
only
gasoline
with
a
percentage
of
ethanol
below
percent
representing
the
vast
majority
of
the
fuel
sold
in
the
country
by
separating
the
two
types
of
fuel
cornyn
believes
generic
rin
prices
would
tumble
saving
refiners
money
the
credits
would
cover
a
smaller
portion
of
the
market
but
theoretically
sell
at
a
premium
preserving
the
incentive
for
companies
to
invest
in
more
ethanol
blending
infrastructure
the
sources
said
refining
company
marathon
petroleum
has
been
an
advocate
of
the
idea
but
segments
of
the
refining
industry
are
opposed
to
sweeping
changes
because
they
profit
from
the
status
quo
the
downstream
committee
of
the
american
petroleum
institute
api
recently
decided
against
voting
on
whether
it
supported
the
rin
proposal
the
sources
said
because
of
opposition
to
the
plan
within
the
group
api
spokeswoman
sabrina
fang
declined
to
comment
on
the
idea
it
is
not
fair
or
appropriate
to
comment
until
there
is
a
legislative
package
released
that
we
can
review
and
comment
on
she
said
but
she
added
the
group
generally
supported
cornyn
s
efforts
to
seek
a
legislative
overhaul
of
the
rfs
members
of
the
biofuel
industry
have
their
concerns
about
the
credit
as
well
biofuel
and
agricultural
voices
do
not
support
the
rin
brooke
coleman
head
of
the
advanced
biofuels
business
council
said
cornyn
s
proposal
would
impact
the
market
for
niche
biofuels
by
dragging
down
their
prices
and
reducing
the
attractiveness
of
investing
in
the
industry
s
development
coleman
said
a
cornyn
spokesman
drew
brandewie
said
the
senator
is
working
hard
to
unify
all
he
said
the
legislation
is
still
being
drafted
and
the
major
industry
trade
groups
have
not
seen
it
he
did
not
comment
on
the
details
of
the
plan
cornyn
s
plan
would
also
lift
a
ban
on
sales
of
blends
during
the
hot
summer
months
something
now
restricted
due
to
rules
the
sources
said
the
proposal
was
included
as
a
concession
to
the
ethanol
industry
which
has
long
opposed
the
ban
to
support
the
broader
rfs
overhaul
but
plan
faces
resistance
from
the
corn
industry
for
another
reason
it
would
let
the
renewable
fuel
program
expire
in
the
sources
said
effectively
replacing
its
biofuels
volume
quotas
with
a
mandate
for
higher
octane
content
in
gasoline
instead
higher
octane
can
increase
fuel
efficiency
it
and
can
be
achieved
by
blending
ethanol
or
other
additives
into
fuel
bob
dinneen
head
of
the
renewable
fuels
association
said
that
idea
endangered
the
ethanol
industry
s
future
any
effort
to
reform
or
repeal
the
rfs
that
is
founded
on
the
premise
of
demand
destruction
is
a
he
said
on
the
sidelines
of
an
industry
event
this
week
in
san
antonio
this
version
of
the
story

been
refiled
