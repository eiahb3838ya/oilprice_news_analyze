corrected-u.s. spending bill expands carbon tax credit, boosting oil producers
houston
reuters
a
addition
to
the
budget
deal
approved
last
week
will
help
occidental
petroleum
corp
and
other
oil
producers
by
more
than
tripling
a
tax
credit
for
injecting
carbon
dioxide
back
into
the
earth
to
increase
crude
output
the
expansion
although
supported
by
environmentalists
and
energy
producers
had
failed
to
move
out
of
congress
during
the
presidential
election
its
passage
now
likely
will
further
boost
already
surging
oil
output
in
a
year
that
production
is
forecast
to
hit
million
barrels
per
day
the
injection
process
used
for
more
than
years
to
prolong
output
from
traditional
oil
wells
also
is
being
tested
by
oxy
and
others
as
a
way
to
speed
more
oil
production
from
shale
wells
president
donald
trump
last
week
signed
the
spending
plan
into
law
it
boosts
for
years
an
existing
tax
credit
to
per
metric
ton
of
carbon
dioxide
injected
underground
up
from
per
ton
this
will
be
an
economic
driver
for
our
nation
said
north
dakota
senator
heidi
heitkamp
a
democrat
who
had
pushed
for
the
credit
s
expansion
with
a
bipartisan
group
of
senators
it
will
hopefully
push
a
lot
of
innovative
technologies
across
a
range
of
industries
not
just
in
coal
or
oxy
denbury
resources
inc
and
others
inject
more
than
billion
cubic
feet
of
carbon
dioxide
each
day
into
traditional
oil
wells
many
of
which
came
online
more
than
years
ago
the
method
harnesses
the
carbon
dioxide
produced
during
the
extraction
of
oil
or
from
plants
and
forces
it
back
into
the
fields
that
helps
drive
more
oil
to
the
surface
the
technique
one
of
several
enhanced
oil
recovery
eor
strategies
that
can
prolong
the
productive
life
of
oilfields
underpins
more
than
five
percent
of
oil
output
or
about
barrels
per
day
according
to
energy
consultancy
advanced
resources
international
eor
can
help
firms
extract
between
percent
and
percent
of
all
the
oil
held
in
a
reservoir
that
s
far
more
than
the
percent
usually
recovered
from
initial
traditional
drilling
according
to
the
department
of
energy
this
legislation
helps
to
ensure
domestic
energy
security

oxy
s
chief
executive
said
in
a
statement
eor
increases
a
producer
s
costs
but
because
eor
wells
pump
consistently
for
decades
their
value
over
time
can
exceed
shale
wells
whose
production
quickly
tapers
off
oxy
has
not
published
anticipated
financial
benefits
from
the
tax
credit
s
expansion
and
wall
street
analysts
who
track
the
company
have
not
offered
any
estimates
but
partly
because
of
its
carbon
operations
oxy
was
able
to
raise
its
dividend
during
the
oil
price
downturn
from
to
oxy
this
week
swung
to
a
profit
that
met
wall
street
s
expectations
