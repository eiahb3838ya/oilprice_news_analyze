berlin
reuters
audi
chairman
matthias
mueller
appealed
to
workers
to
ignore
a
media
report
that
chief
executive
rupert
stadler
was
about
to
be
ousted
hoping
to
quell
further
unrest
at
the
volkswagen
group
german
tabloid
bild
reported
on
its
front
page
on
friday
that
stadler
would
leave
in
april
because
of
his
handling
of
the
diesel
emissions
affair
in
which
audi
played
a
prominent
role
the
report
said
stadler
would
however
be
given
a
new
role
as
vw
group
finance
chief
in
a
message
to
audi
staff
mueller
who
is
also
ceo
of
parent
company
volkswagen
said
the
luxury
carmaker
needed
the
full
concentration
of
management
and
workers
to
overcome
its
current
challenges
under
stadler
s
proven
leadership
please
pay
no
attention
to
the
personnel
speculation
spread
by
the
media
which
lacks
any
foundation
mueller
said
in
the
message
sent
to
reuters
by
email
volkswagen
has
repeatedly
attempted
to
draw
a
line
under
a
scandal
that
broke
out
in
when
it
admitted
cheating
tests
in
the
united
states
to
conceal
the
amount
of
noxious
gases
emitted
by
some
of
its
vehicles
under
mueller
who
took
over
when
martin
winterkorn
quit
days
after
the
scandal
broke
the
leading
german
carmaker
has
settled
the
main
legal
case
to
result
from
the
cheating
and
sought
to
turn
the
page
with
an
initiative
but
the
dieselgate
crisis
refuses
to
die
reigniting
conflicts
between
the
powerful
family
management
trade
union
and
political
interests
who
vie
for
the
upper
hand
in
the
group
on
thursday
volkswagen
s
top
labor
representative
said
the
company
s
drive
to
improve
accountability
seen
by
investors
as
a
major
plank
in
vw
s
ability
to
regain
trust
had
made
zero
progress
sources
have
said
that
mueller
is
growing
frustrated
by
a
lack
of
support
for
his
reform
efforts
and
by
the
lingering
scandal
vw
chairman
hans
dieter
poetsch
said
on
monday
there
was
no
reason
to
question
mueller
s
position
the
revelation
last
month
that
german
carmakers
including
volkswagen
had
commissioned
tests
in
which
monkeys
were
exposed
to
toxic
diesel
fumes
were
a
stark
reminder
that
vw
had
not
yet
put
its
past
behind
it
and
last
week
audi
s
headquarters
were
searched
by
german
prosecutors
widening
their
inquiry
into
the
manipulation
of
tests
stadler
ran
finance
at
audi
for
four
years
before
becoming
ceo
in
he
was
a
confidant
of
and
former
assistant
to
chairman
ferdinand
piech
the
scion
of
volkswagen
s
controlling
clan
who
was
himself
ousted
in
his
position
as
ceo
has
been
questioned
before
but
so
far
audi
s
board
has
rallied
around
him
bild
said
stadler
would
be
moved
to
take
charge
of
vw
group
s
finance
portfolio
currently
run
by
frank
witter
a
former
head
of
the
carmaker
s
financial
services
division
witter
is
well
regarded
among
investors
and
uncontroversial
with
vw
s
powerful
unions
a
source
close
to
vw
said
sources
close
to
audi
said
there
had
been
no
discussion

the

through
which
the

and
piech

control
their
majority
stake
in
vw
declined
comment
a
senior
source
close
to
vw
told
reuters
last
week
that
stadler
retained
the
backing
of
the
clan
bild
said
that
chief
winfried
vahland
who
quit
the
vw
group
weeks
after
the
scandal
broke
out
in
declining
to
take
up
his
post
as
north
america
chief
was
favorite
to
succeed
stadler
should
vahland
refuse
the
job
bmw
development
chief
klaus
froehlich
was
a
possible
alternative
it
said
but
bmw
said
froehlich
was
not
a
candidate
to
replace
stadler
reuters
could
not
immediately
reach
vahland
who
has
kept
a
low
profile
after
quitting
volkswagen
audi
vw
s
main
profit
contributor
did
not
admit
to
using
illicit
emissions
control
devices
in
the
united
states
until
november
two
months
after
the
scandal
at
parent
vw
was
revealed
audi
developed
the
bigger

diesel
engines
used
in
about

audi
and
porsche
