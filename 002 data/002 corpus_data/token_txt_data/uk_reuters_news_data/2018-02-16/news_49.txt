when
a
mexican
real
estate
investment
trust
bought
four
hotels
along
the
country
s
gulf
coast
operating
under
the
marriott
quality
inn
and
fiesta
inn
brands
it
expected
the
government
s
recent
energy
reform
to
attract
droves
of
oil
executives
engineers
and
technicians
instead
fibrahotel
s
properties
in
ciudad
del
carmen
and
villahermosa
and
an
earlier
purchase
in
coatzacoalcos
like
many
along
the
gulf
are
pinched
for
guests
president
enrique
pena
nieto
s
legislative
overhaul
of
the
energy
sector
which
broke
a
monopoly
by
state
oil
firm
pemex
had
been
expected
to
jumpstart
the
economy
and
revive
the
declining
oil
industry
it
coincided
however
with
a
global
collapse
in
oil
prices
that
muted
investors
interest
prices
are
now
rebounding
and
the
government
forecasts
that
some
of
the
world
s
largest
oil
companies
will
ultimately
invest
about
billion
in
mexico
if
they
succeed
in
extraction
efforts
but
experts
say
the
promised
growth
could
still
be
several
years
coming
in
the
oil
towns
hotel
occupancy
rates
have
fallen
by
as
much
as
half
said
real
estate
brokerage
jones
lang
lasalle
with
some
in
the
region
operating
with
barely
a
third
of
their
rooms
full
hotels
in
coatzacoalcos
in
veracruz
state
registered
percent
occupancy
last
year
the
state
s
main
port
veracruz
and
the
neighboring
boca
del
rio
area
fared
a
little
better
with
percent
as
did
villahermosa
in
neighboring
tabasco
state
that
is
well
below
the
booming
rates
seen
last
year
in
tourist
hotspots
such
as
cancun
and
riviera
maya
the
tourism
ministry
says
and
lower
than
automobile
manufacturing
hubs
such
as
guadalajara
and
leon
it
s
been
weaker
than
in
past
years
said
guillermo
bravo
head
of
fibrahotel
s
corporate
development
he
declined
to
give
occupancy
figures
for
the
gulf
coast
properties
the
company
bought
in
and
but
he
said
they
are
below
the
average
for
the
rest
of
its
portfolio
which
stretches
across
more
than
two
dozen
mexican
states
now
the
company
says
its
best
option
is
to
wait
it
wouldn
t
be
a
good
moment
to
sell
bravo
said
hotels
typically
need
percent
occupancy
to
break
even
according
to
christian
lega
a
director
of
tourism
at
real
estate
services
firm
cbre
hotels
while
hotel
owners
and
operators
on
the
gulf
were
reluctant
to
provide
specific
figures
several
acknowledged
the
falling
occupancy
a
source
familiar
with
hyatt
place
in
ciudad
del
carmen
who
declined
to
be
named
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
matter
said
the
property
is
about
a
third
full
and
recently
closed
some
of
its
rooms
hyatt
declined
to
provide
current
data
but
said
ciudad
del
carmen
hotels
had
percent
occupancy
in
that
is
in
line
with
other
cities
in
the
area
in
the
years
before
oil
prices
plummeted
hoteles
city
express
which
says
percent
of
its
mexico
portfolio
is
largely
reliant
on
the
energy
industry
has
seen
its
gulf
coast
occupancy
rates
slip
since
spokeswoman
blanca
herrera
said
the
company
is
targeting
other
business
sectors
and
leisure
travelers
in
the
area
hotels
are
faced
with
slashing
costs
to
break
even
and
in
the
most
dire
cases
could
risk
losing
partnerships
with
prestigious
brands
such
as
hyatt
marriott
and
holiday
inn
lega
said
hotel
brands
typically
agree
to
emblazon
their
names
on
properties
if
they
expect
percent
occupancy
lega
said
lower
levels
can
pose
a
risk
to
their
reputations
hotels
in
major
oil
towns
are
operating
well
below
that
level
according
to
tourism
ministry
data
compiled
by
jones
lang
lasalle
they
thought
the
energy
reform
would
generate
investment
much
sooner
lega
said
fibrahotel
recently
changed
one
of
its
ciudad
del
carmen
sites
from
a
courtyard
marriott
to
a
fiesta
inn
matching
the
brand
of
its
other
nearby
properties
running
both
hotels
under
one
operator
gave
us
more
synergies
and
economies
of
scale
bravo
said
adding
that
it
was
not
marriott
s
decision
a
spokesperson
for
marriott
international
inc
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
although
many
in
the
sector
are
hopeful
that
hotels
will
again
fill
with
oil
workers
as
firms
that
won
contracts
in
mexico
s
early
auctions
begin
deploying
staff
gulf
coast
hoteliers
worry
travelers
will
be
deterred
by
the
country
s
worst
ever
surge
in
violent
crime
there
s
the
perception
that
we
re
always
in
fear
said
esteban
enriquez
espana
president
of
the
coatzacoalcos
hotel
and
motel
association
in
veracruz
the
state
with
the
fifth
highest
number
of
murders
in
mexico
last
year
it
s
a
problem
that
s
gotten
out
of
control
