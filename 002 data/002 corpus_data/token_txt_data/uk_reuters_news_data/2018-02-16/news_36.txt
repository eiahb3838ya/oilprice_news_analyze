russia
s
economy
could
be
hit
in
by
cuts
in
crude
production
as
part
of
the
supply
pact
with
further
economic
pain
after
the
the
central
bank
said
on
friday
oil
is
a
key
source
of
budget
revenue
for
russia
which
pledged
to
cut
output
by
barrels
per
day
bpd
from
the
peak
of
million
bpd
reached
in
october
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
along
with
other
large
exporters
including
russia
have
agreed
to
maintain
their
restriction
on
crude
supply
for
a
second
year
to
reduce
stockpiles
and
support
prices
we
assume
that
the
deal
along
with
weaker
demand
for
natural
gas
from
abroad
will
temporary
curb
growth
in
russian
oil
and
gas
production
which
may
have
a
negative
impact
on
economic
growth
in
general
it
said
russian
gas
company
gazprom
s
exports
to
countries
outside
the
former
soviet
union
fell
by
percent
year
on
year
in
january
caused
by
relatively
warm
weather
in
more
risks
for
the
russia
s
energy
revenue
could
also
arise
from
the
global
influx
of
electric
vehicles
in
the
the
central
bank
said
given
improving
fuel
efficiency
and
growth
in
electric
car
market
it
said
that
peak
oil
consumption
is
likely
to
be
reached
in
the
leading
to
lower
crude
prices
