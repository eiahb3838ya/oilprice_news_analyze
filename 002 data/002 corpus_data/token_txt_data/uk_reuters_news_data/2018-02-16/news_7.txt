albania
plans
to
launch
a
power
exchange
next
january
and
the
government
will
choose
partners
to
run
it
alongside
the
transmission
system
operator
a
government
official
said
on
friday
albania
s
parliament
passed
legislation
on
thursday
paving
the
way
for
the
government
to
move
ahead
with
its
plans
for
the
exchange
and
meet
a
deadline
set
under
a
cooperation
agreement
with
other
balkan
countries
known
as
the
western
balkans
six
we
are
optimistic
we
ll
have
the
exchange
by
january
this
is
a
difficult
process
entela
cipa
an
energy
specialist
and
adviser
to
the
energy
minister
told
reuters
dependant
entirely
on
hydropower
albania
has
been
a
net
power
importer
since
it
dumped
communism
years
ago
except
for
when
it
exported
for
the
first
time
launching
the
plans
for
the
exchange
became
possible
after
power
generation
transmission
and
distribution
monopolies
invested
more
than
million
euros
million
to
upgrade
their
networks
and
cut
losses
the
albanian
power
exchange
will
be
able
to
take
on
as
shareholders
international
energy
operators
other
transmission
operators
and
also
international
financial
institutions
cipa
said
the
exchange
will
trade

consulting
is
advising
on
the
project
albania
and
neighbouring
kosovo
decided
last
november
their
transmission
operators
would
own
an
equal
share
of
the
exchange
she
said
we
are
open
to
partnerships
because
international
ones
provide
guarantees
since
the
bourse
of
a
small
country
like
ours
might
find
it
hard
to
draw
high
trade
volumes
she
added
albania
is
also
talking
about
possible
partnerships
with
montenegro
and
serbia
initially
the
exchange
will
work
with
industrial
consumers
which
pay
unregulated
prices
and
which
represent
around
percent
of
the
power
consumed
in
the
country
albania
usually
imports
to
tw
of
power
each
year
its
monopoly
kesh
produces
from
to
tw
in
a
good
year
while
private
producers
generate
a
total
of
to
tw
norway
s
statkraft
has
a
power
plant
in
albania
which
now
produce
mw
a
year
and
will
produce

when
its
second
plant
comes
online
