been
reassured
by

vix
index
the
fear
gauge
that
measures
the
implied
volatility
of
stocks
the
index
dropped
below
for
the
first
time
since
its
spike
to
high
of
last
week
a
jump
that
caused
massive
losses
among
investors
who
bet
equity
markets
would
be
stable
on
a
combination
of
solid
economic
growth
and
moderate
inflation
the
vix
futures
fell
back
to
more
normal
patterns
from
the
past
several
days
of
backwardation
in
which
the

becomes

curve
suggested

had
run

easing
investors
nerves
the
dollar
on
the
other
hand
slipped
below
its
january
low
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
to
reach
its
lowest
since
late
the
dollar
index
fell
to
as
low
as
and
was
on
course
to
lose
over
percent
for
the
week
its
bigguest
such
loss
in
two
years
there
is
no
strong
consensus
yet
on
what
is
driving
the
dollar
s
persistent
weakness
especially
in
light
of
rising
yields
some
say
it
simply
reflects
a
return
of
risk
appetite
and
a
shift
to
currencies
including
many
emerging
market
ones
but
others
cite
concerns
that
washington
might
pursue
a
weak
dollar
strategy
as
well
as
talk
that
foreign
central
banks
may
be
reallocating
their
reserves
out
of
the
dollar
there
are
also
worries
president
donald
trump
s
tax
cuts
and
fiscal
spending
could
stoke
inflation
and
erode
the
value
of
the
dollar
his
protectionist
policies
could
also
fan
inflation
markets
appear
to
have
calmed
down
for
now
but
fundamentally
it
is
different
from
last
year
said
yoshinori
shigemi
global
market
strategist
at
jpmorgan
asset
management
you
could
say
that
right
now
rather
than
stocks
rising
around
the
world
it
is
the
dollar
falling
against
almost
everything
he
added
the
euro
rose
to
its
highest
since
december
the
dollar
changed
hands
at
yen
having
fallen
to
as
low
as
its
lowest
level
since
november
the
yen
showed
little
reaction
to
the
government
s
reappointment
of
kuroda
or
its
nomination
of
an
advocate
of
bolder
monetary
easing
as
one
of
his
deputies
the
south
african
rand
hit
a
high
of
to
the
dollar
on
thursday
on
hopes
the
resignation
of
president
jacob
zuma
had
paved
the
way
for
new
leaders
to
speed
up
economic
growth
the
dollar
s
fall
came
even
as
bond
yields
remained
near
a
high
the
treasuries
yield
hit
a
peak
of
percent
on
thursday
and
last
stood
at
percent
yields
also
rose
as
investors
grew
convinced
that
the
correction
in
stock
prices
in
recent
weeks
would
not
prevent
the
fed
from
raising
interest
rates
in
march
and
twice
more
this
year
cleveland

loretta
mester
said
on
tuesday
the
recent
stock
market
and
jump
in
volatility
will
not
damage
the
economy
s
overall
strong
prospects
mester
is
being
considered
a
leading
candidate
for
the

chair
the
