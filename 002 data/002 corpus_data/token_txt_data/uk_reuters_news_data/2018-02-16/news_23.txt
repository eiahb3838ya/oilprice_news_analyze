qatar calls for eu-style security pact for middle east
munich
reuters
middle
eastern
states
should
put
their
differences
behind
them
and
forge
a
security
pact
modelled
on
the
european
union
in
order
to
pull
the
region
back
from
the
brink
qatar
s
emir
sheikh
tamim
bin
hamad
said
on
friday
he
asked
the
international
community
to
keep
up
diplomatic
pressure
on
the
countries
concerned
to
achieve
that
but
offered
few
other
details
i
believe
that
it
is
time
for
wider
regional
security
in
the
middle
east
it
is
time
for
all
nations
of
the
region
to
forget
the
past
including
us
and
agree
on
basic
security
principles
and
rules
of
governance
and
at
least
a
minimum
level
of
security
to
allow
for
peace
and
prosperity
sheikh
tamim
told
a
security
conference
in
munich
this
should
not
be
a
pipe
dream
too
much
is
at
risk
the
middle
east
is
at
the
brink
it
s
time
to
bring
it
qatar
a
tiny
but
rich
gulf
arab
state
has
been
isolated
over
the
past
seven
months
by
trade
and
travel
sanctions
imposed
by
the
united
arab
emirates
saudi
arabia
bahrain
and
egypt
over
accusations
denied
by
doha
that
it
supports
terrorism
and
regional
rival
iran
efforts
by
the
united
states
and
kuwait
to
end
the
rift
have
failed
to
produce
any
results
in
addition
to
the
gulf
row
sheikh
tamim
referenced
violent
conflicts
in
syria
yemen
and
libya
which
have
sparked
humanitarian
catastrophes
and
one
of
the
largest
refugee
crises
ever
with
millions
of
people
washing
up
in
europe
in
recent
years
we
can
mirror
efforts
of
the
european
union
its
ability
to
find
common
ground
to
rebuild
and
prosper
he
added
shifting
from
feuds
to
cooperation
will
require
that
we
each
be
held
