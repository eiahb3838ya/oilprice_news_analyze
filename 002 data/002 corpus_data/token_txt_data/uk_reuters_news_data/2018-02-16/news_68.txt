an
eu
decision
to
curb
palm
oil
imports
was
the
last
thing
malaysian
prime
minister
najib
razak
needed
ahead
of
a
coming
election
with
rural
voters
already
aggrieved
over
financial
scandals
at
palm
oil
agency
felda
around
percent
of
malaysia
s
million
people
belong
to
families
who
own
smallholdings
dedicated
to
harvesting
palm
oil
and
they
account
for
the
majority
of
voters
in
nearly
a
quarter
of
the
national
assembly
s
seats
girding
for
a
general
election
due
by
august
najib
was
given
a
taste
of
the
discontent
rife
in
the
countryside
when
hundreds
of
farmers
flocked
to
kuala
lumpur
last
month
to
protest
a
pending
eu
move
to
phase
out
the
use
of
palm
oil
in
biofuel
i
will
not
support
the
government
if
they
don
t
resolve
this
issue

the

najib
can
to
lose
votes
from
malays
in
rural
areas
that
have
hitherto
been
a
votebank
for
the
united

national
organization
umno
the
party
that
has
led
every
coalition
since
malaysia
emerged
from
british
colonial
rule
in
aged
and
having
stood
down
in
as
malaysia
s
longest
serving
premier
mahathir
mohamad
has
come
out
of
retirement
to
lead
the
campaign
against
his
protege
najib
having
forged
an
unlikely
alliance
with
jailed
opposition
leader
anwar
ibrahim
malays
loyalty
to
umno
has
been
tested
by
the
steady
flow
of
stories
over
the
past
three
years
about
development
bhd
a
state
investment
firm
whose
funds
critics
say
were
used
by
najib
to
boost
his
campaign
for
the
election
which
he
narrowly
won
while
losing
the
popular
vote
to
an
opposition
bloc
led
by
anwar
najib
who
chaired
s
advisory
board
until
it
was
dissolved
in
has
consistently
denied
any
wrongdoing
over
the
billions
of
dollars
lost
by
the
fund
but
an
ongoing
kleptocracy
investigation
into
in
the
united
states
the
biggest
mounted
by
department
of
justice
has
kept
on
the
frontburner
to
cement
authority
and
protect
himself
analysts
say
najib
needs
to
lead
umno
to
a
convincing
victory
the
controversy
has
damaged
najib
s
standing
more
among
urban
malays
but
over
the
past
year
rural
malays
have
found
their
own
reasons
to
be
upset
malaysia

smallholders

told

the
government
is
working
on
expanding
export
markets
to
other
palm
buyers
like
iran
vietnam
and
japan
in
a
bid
to
shore
up
demand
but
the
government
s
threat
of
retaliatory
trade
measures
against
the
eu
has
been
scorned
by
critics
who
say
it
will
lead
to
further
loss
of
palm
oil
business
to
competitors
by
saying
you
will
ban
eu
imports
you
are
just
pushing
away
the
palm

business
to
indonesia
said

hasn

with

last

sell

fighter
jets
worth
about
billion
smallholders
have
seen
monthly
incomes
drop
as
low
as
ringgit
when
palm
prices
were
low
forcing
many
into
debt
over
the
years
and
when
allegations
of
corruption
surfaced
last
year
at
the
federal
land
development
authority
felda
a
state
plantation
agency
founded
to
alleviate
rural
poverty
the
government
came
under
fire
in
the
small
towns
and
villages
that
make
up
the
malay
heartland
many
of
felda
s
settlers
took
loans
to
invest
in
felda
global
ventures
a
listed
unit
of
felda
that
raised
bln
when
it
was
launched
in
and
has
since
seen
its
share
price
plunge
by
percent
fgv
s
chairman
was
forced
to
quit
last
year
and
its
chief
executive
was
suspended
for
four
months
during
a
government
probe
into
suspicious
transactions
at
a
subsidiary
he
later
resumed
his
role
najib
moved
to
appease
felda
settlers
last
july
with
cash
handouts
subsidies
and
debt
waivers
totalling
nearly
billion
ringgit
million
the
game
is
to
constantly
keep
the
palm
planters
happy
said
pkr
s
wong
chen
but
they
are
far
from
happy
the
controversies
at
fgv
have
barely
abated
critics
say
it
overpaid
buying
assets
notably
the
million
purchase
of
a
percent
stake
in
an
indonesian
palm
oil
firm
questions
have
also
been
raised
last
month
over
a
felda
land
deal
in
kuala
lumpur
which
allegedly
points
to
criminal
fraud
felda
did
not
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
but
on
this
most
recent
land
deal
scandal
najib
said
in
a
blog
post
that
the
government
would
ensure
the
interests
of
felda
and
the
settlers
are
not
compromised
however
this
core
constituency
s
patience
with
the
government
may
have
run
out
these
issues
have
raised
anger
among
the
settlers
said
mazlan
aliman
president
of
the
national
felda
settlers
children
society
anak
they
see
the
government
is
not
serious
in
addressing
these
issues
but
instead
try
to
cover
the
damage
that
has
been
done
is
too
big
it
will
influence
the
mood
of
voters
in
the
upcoming
elections
especially
in
felda
areas
