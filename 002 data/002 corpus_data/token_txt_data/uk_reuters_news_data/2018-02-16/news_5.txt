update 3-osce calls for effort to jumpstart ukraine peace process
munich
reuters
urgent
efforts
are
needed
to
jumpstart
the
peace
process
in
eastern
ukraine
the
head
of
the
organisation
for
security
and
in
europe
said
on
friday
warning
that
continued
daily
ceasefire
violations
could
spiral
out
of
control
thomas
greminger
who
took
over
as
secretary
general
of
the
osce
in
july
told
reuters
he
hoped
a
planned
meeting
by
top
officials
from
germany
france
russia
and
ukraine
on
the
sidelines
of
the
munich
security
conference
could
help
end
a
political
impasse
on
the
crisis
a
separatist
insurgency
led
to
fighting
that
has
killed
people
since
while
combat
mostly
ended
in
after
france
germany
russia
and
ukraine
sponsored
a
ceasefire
agreement
in
the
belarus
capital
minsk
casualties
are
still
reported
on
a
near
daily
basis
in
incidents
along
the
front
line
the
osce
a
european
security
body
tasked
with
monitoring
the
agreement
still
sees
an
average
of
ceasefire
violations
a
day
greminger
told
reuters
in
an
interview
at
the
annual
munich
security
conference
this
has
to
stop
greminger
said
what
we
desperately
need
is
another
political
impulse
he
said
adding
that
it
should
come
from
the
four
countries
that
sponsored
minsk
officials
from
the
four
countries
cancelled
a
meeting
that
had
been
due
to
take
place
friday
evening
in
munich
citing
scheduling
conflicts
but
said
they
were
trying
to
find
another
time
to
meet
before
the
annual
security
event
ends
i
would
look
forward
to
seeing
germany
again
assuming
a
leadership
role
ideally
together
with
france
and
then
i
think
we
have
a
fair
chance
that
the
russian
federation
and
ukraine
could
come
along
greminger
said
the
parties
have
failed
to
withdraw
heavy
military
equipment
from
the
lines
of
conflict
as
agreed
in
the
ceasefire
agreement
he
said
there
was
also
a
big
risk
that
shelling
could
inadvertently
result
in
a
catastrophic
chemical
spill
at
a
water
filtration
plant
near
the
front
he
said
the
risk
is
growing
that
one
day
you
will
have
an
incident
that
gets
out
of
control
he
said
greminger
said
he
worried
about
a
general
increase
in
tensions
between
russia
and
the
west
in
the
region
at
a
time
when
both
have
staged
snap
military
exercises
later
in
a
fiery
speech
to
the
conference
ukraine
s
president
pedro
poroshenko
urged
delegates
to
push
for
united
nations
peacekeepers
to
be
deployed
across
the
entire
region
controlled
by
separatists
there
is
a
chance
for
moscow
to
show
the
sense
of
compromise
and
agree
to
peacekeepers
throughout
the
whole
territory
of
donbass
including
the
uncontrolled
part
of
ukraine
on
the
russian
border
he
said
greminger
said
discussions
about
a
peacekeeping
force
could
represent
a
first
step
toward
a
move
to
end
the
fighting
in
the
donbass
region
he
said
one
option
might
be
a
joint
peacekeeping
force
the
osce
set
up
during
the
cold
war
as
a
forum
that
would
include
both
sides
is
still
one
of
the
few
bodies
which
regularly
brings
russia
together
with
the
united
states
and
its
western
allies
it
has
initiated
a
dialogue
aimed
at
lowering
military
and
political
risks
which
greminger
said
could
lead
to
some
measures
in
months
with
an
eye
to
working
on
conventional
arms
reduction
in
years
but
the
prerequisite
was
rebuilding
trust
among
the
parties
greminger
said
we
need
some
political
leadership
and
we
need
to
do
that
now
because
we
are
on
the
brink
of
major
conflict
he
said
greminger
said
he
hoped
ukraine
could
agree
to
some
concessions
on
a
dispute
over
visas
that
prompted
russian
military
officers
to
withdraw
from
a
ceasefire
control
group

december
