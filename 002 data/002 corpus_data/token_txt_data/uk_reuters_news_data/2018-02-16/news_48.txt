mexico
s
foreign
minister
will
travel
to
jamaica
grenada
and
saint
lucia
in
march
a
mexican
official
said
on
thursday
as
part
of
efforts
to
erode
venezuela
s
influence
in
the
caribbean
meanwhile
cuban
diplomats
will
visit
mexico
in
march
to
discuss
the
regional
impact
of
the
crisis
in
venezuela
the
official
said
the
cuban
embassy
in
mexico
city
said
the
trip
was
not
yet
confirmed
but
that
the
two
countries
have
regular
bilateral
meetings
still
there
are
no
signs
that
cuba
a
steadfast
ally
of
caracas
is
ready
to
turn
its
back
on
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
mexican
foreign
minister
luis
videgaray
s
planned
trip
follows
a
visit
to
latin
america
and
the
caribbean
earlier
this
month
by
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
who
announced
plans
to
study
how
possible
oil
sanctions
against
venezuela
could
be
mitigated
in
the
caribbean
the
mexican
foreign
minister
s
trip
represents
the
latest
development
in
pressure
on
maduro
who
retains
loyalty
from
some
caribbean
nations
that
have
long
benefited
from
caracas
oil
largess
and
have
been
unwilling
to
shun
the
country
in
regional
diplomatic
efforts
the
message
is
venezuela
is
not
the
only
country
that
can
help
caribbean
nations
that
if
there
s
a
crisis
in
venezuela
they
have
more
friends
said
the
mexican
official
who
was
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
about
the
undisclosed
trip
the
mexican
foreign
ministry
did
not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for
comment
the
foreign
ministries
of
jamaica
grenada
and
saint
lucia
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
videgaray
has
led
mexico
s
efforts
to
try
and
improve
cooperation
with
its
top
trade
partner
on
security
immigration
and
foreign
policy
hoping
to
convince
the
united
states
to
take
a
softer
stance
on
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
nafta
that
underpins
the
majority
of
mexican
exports
president
donald
trump
has
threatened
to
quit
the
pact
if
it
can
not
be
improved
to
benefit
workers
on
his
way
to
jamaica
tillerson
said
the
united
states
was
closer
to
deciding
whether
to
impose
sanctions
on
venezuelan
oil
adding
that
canada
mexico
and
the
united
states
were
studying
how
to
mitigate
the
impact
of
such
a
move
restrictions
on
venezuela
s
oil
industry
would
represent
an
escalation
of
financial
pressure
on
the
opec
member
which
is
gripped
by
severe
shortages
of
food
and
medicine
such
sanctions
could
also
hurt
refineries
that
process
venezuelan
oil
sanctions
have
so
far
focused
on
individual
members
of
maduro
s
government
and
a
ban
on
buying
new
venezuelan
debt
in
a
june
meeting
in
cancun
foreign
ministers
from
the
organization
of
american
states
oas
failed
to
reach
agreement
on
a
resolution
criticizing
venezuela
with
only
countries
backing
the
proposal
shy
of
the
threshold
saint
kitts
and
nevis
saint
vincent
and
the
grenadines
and
dominica
voted
against
the
resolution
while
grenada
haiti
the
dominican
republic
trinidad
and
tobago
and
antigua
and
barbuda
abstained
jamaica
and
saint
lucia
backed
the
proposal
officials
from
other
caribbean
nations
will
be
present
at
videgaray
s
jamaican
stop
the
mexican
official
said
adding
that
the
caribbean
trip
represents
an
attempt
to
end
the
stalemate
in
the
june
oas
meeting
it
s
a
result
of
cancun
the
official
said
there
was
a
bloc
in
the
caribbean
that
wasn
t
pulling
in
the
same
direction
as
the
reuters
reported
last
year
that
mexico
was
looking
at
the
possibility
of
replacing
venezuela
s
petrocaribe
program
that
provided
cheap
loans
for
oil
to
caribbean
nations
and
has
helped
maduro
retain
diplomatic
support
in
the
region
however
the
mexican
official
said
it
was
still
not
clear
how
mexico
could
furnish
caribbean
nations
with
cheap
energy
given
the
country
s
struggling
domestic
fuel
production
and
that
mexico
relies
on
oil
income
for
about
a
fifth
of
the
government
budget
the
energy
ministry
remains
unconvinced
by
the
oil
diplomacy
plan
led
by
videgaray
but
there
are
signs
it
is
becoming
more
flexible

official
