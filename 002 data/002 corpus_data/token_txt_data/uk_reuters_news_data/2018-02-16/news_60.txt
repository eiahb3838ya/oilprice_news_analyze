corrected-gazprom demands discounts from russian pipemakers as investments peak
moscow
reuters
gas
giant
gazprom
is
demanding
big
discounts
from
russian
pipeline
suppliers
for
its
major
projects
industry
sources
told
reuters
following
the
emergence
of
a
producer
charging
significantly
lower
prices
in
a
move
likely
to
shake
up
the
pipe
and
metals
sectors
the
gazprom
is
seeking
the
discounts
put
by
the
sources
at
percent
as
it
tries
to
limit
investment
spending
that
is
due
to
peak
in
the
next
two
years
gazprom
is
involved
in
three
international
gas
pipeline
projects
it
is
already
building
turkstream
to
turkey
and
power
of
siberia
to
supply
china
and
is
preparing
for
the
nord
stream
link
to
europe
its
average
annual
investments
to
are
planned
at
trillion
roubles
billion
reaching
their
highest
point
between
and
trying
to
stand
up
to
gazprom
a
major
client
which
has
a
de
facto
monopoly
on
russian
gas
exports
by
pipeline
appears
hopeless
sources
at
the
producers
said
you
can
t
say
no

gazprom
s
demands
for
discounts
concern
large
diameter
pipes
ldp
a
market
which
is
currently
oversupplied
one
source
at
a
pipe
producer
and
a
gazprom
source
said
we
looked
at
the
market
and
decided
that
we
were
paying
above
the
market
price
we
wanted
to
discuss
this
with
the
pipemakers
the
gazprom
source
said
ldp
pipes
those
with
a
diameter
of
centimetres
or
more
constitute
over
percent
of
gazprom
s
pipe
purchases
according
to
gazprom
s
report
for
the
first
half
of
it
bought
them
almost
entirely
from
four
russian
firms
steelmakers
omk
and
severstal
plus
specialist
pipemakers
chelpipe
and
tmk
which
buy
in
steel
talks
are
still
underway
between
gazprom
and
the
ldp
producers
another
source
at
a
pipe
maker
and
the
gazprom
source
said
on
condition
of
anonymity
as
they
were
not
allowed
to
talk
to
the
press
the
press
departments
of
tmk
omk
and
chelpipe
declined
requests
for
comment
gazprom
did
not
respond
severstal
which
supplied
a
quarter
of
gazprom
s
ldp
needs
in
the
first
half
of
last
year
said
it
was
continuing
to
make
and
deliver
pipes
from
its
factory
in
st
petersburg
following
negotiations
with
gazprom
we
held
talks
and
agreed
the
main
parameters
of
our
cooperation
we
have
contractual
obligations
which
meant
production
at
our
izhora
plant
did
not
stop
a
company
spokeswoman
said
gazprom
s
hand
appears
to
have
been
further
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
it
has
already
bought
many
of
the
pipes
needed
for
power
of
siberia
and
turkstream
with
the
bulk
of
investment
spending
channelled
into
other
project
costs
its
insistence
on
a
different
deal
for
the
pipes
it
still
requires
for
the
russian
domestic
link
to
nord
stream
follows
the
arrival
on
the
scene
of
a
newcomer
ztz
industry
sources
said
ztz
which
produced
its
first
pipe
only
two
years
ago
says
it
has
offered
prices
between
percent
and
percent
lower
than
its
competitors
our
colleagues
need
to
justify
their
artificially
high
prices
to
their
client
a
company
spokesman
said
adding
that
it
was
buying
steel
at
a
more
optimal
price
ztz
is
ramping
up
production
at
its
plant
near
moscow
just
as
domestic
demand
for
ldp
is
falling
last
year
it
dropped
percent
to
million
tonnes
according
to
the
foundation
for
development
of
the
tube
industry
a
lobby
group
in
ztz
injected
tonnes
of
ldp
into
the
market
while
the
quartet
of
established
producers
had
to
run
their
factories
at
less
than
half
capacity
demand
is
expected
to
fall
a
further
percent
this
year
the
lobby
group
said
as
a
number
of
major
projects
such
as
the
southern
corridor
a
km
mile
domestic
link
to
turkstream
were
wrapped
up
in
meanwhile
ztz
said
it
expects
to
raise
production
to
tonnes
this
year
ztz
is
a
private
company
whose
shareholders
are
not
disclosed
it
is
headed
by
denis
safin
this
is
a
buyers
market
if
the
buyer
can
push
down
prices
by
percent
companies
will
have
to
survive
with
a
very
low
level
of
profitability
boris
krasnojenov
head
of
metals
and
mining
research
at
alfa
bank
said
apart
from
the
large
investment
programme
gazprom
s
costs
could
be
further
under
pressure
from
external
factors
particularly
with
the
nord
stream
which
is
due
to
run
under
the
baltic
to
germany
denmark
has
passed
a
law
that
could
allow
it
to
ban
the
pipeline
from
its
waters
and
a
new
law
imposing
more
sanctions
on
russia
could
also
complicate
the
billion
project
russian
steelmakers
ramped
up
production
in
making
the
most
of
rising
prices
and
demand
after
a
downturn
expecting
a
further
increase
in
the
domestic
consumption
this
year
helped
by
an
economic
recovery
if
the
discounts
with
gazprom
are
finalised
the
pipe
producers
will
try
to
reduce
costs
to
protect
their
margins
analysts
say
with
the
specialists
likely
to
seek
discounts
in
turn
from
their
steel
suppliers
for
tmk
for
example
russia
business
makes
up
around
to
percent
of
its
core
earnings
ebitda
nikolay
sosnovskiy
director
of
metals
and
mining
at
prosperity
capital
said
tmk
also
has
operations
in
the
united
states
europe
and
middle
east
obviously
such
sharp
fluctuations
in
the
price
are
a
big
deal
especially
if
the
company
doesn
t
change
its
cost
structure
they
re
unlikely
to
just
accept
the
discount
as
it
is
sosnovskiy
said
one
of
the
sources
at
a
pipe
company
said
that
his
firm
had
already
started
negotiations
with
its
steel
suppliers
over
a
discount
following
gazprom
s
demands
another
source
confirmed
that
pipe
producers
have
turned
to
their
steel
suppliers
to
find
a
way
to
pass
the
discount
down
the
supply
chain
pipemakers
are
profitable
so
this
is
not
a
tragedy
for
them
a
leading
figure
in
the
pipe
industry
said
but
when
you
are
squeezed
hard
everything
will
come
down
to
individuals
talent
for
business
overall
it
will
have
a
positive
effect
on
the
industry
it
s
a
signal
time
to
start
sweating
