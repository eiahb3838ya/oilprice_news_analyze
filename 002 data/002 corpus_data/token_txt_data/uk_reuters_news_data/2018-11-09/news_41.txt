china
s
record
imports
of
crude
oil
in
october
are
without
a
doubt
a
bullish
outcome
but
within
the
broader
pattern
of
growing
demand
there
were
some
temporary
factors
lifting
purchases
china
imported
million
tonnes
of
crude
in
october
equivalent
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
a
figure
that
beat
the
previous
record
of
million
bpd
from
april
imports
jumped
a
massive
percent
from
the
same
month
a
year
earlier
and
also
by
percent
from
september
according
to
customs
data
it
s
probably
worth
trying
to
split
the
underlying
trend
in
china
s
oil
imports
from
the
factors
that
can
cause
outcomes
such
as
october
s
record
the
chinese
oil
import
story
is
still
one
of
strength
with
economic
growth
falling
domestic
output
and
the
ongoing
strategic
storage
buildup
all
contributing
for
the
first
months
of
the
year
china
the
world
s
biggest
crude
buyer
imported
million
bpd
a
gain
of
percent
over
the
same
period
in
none
of
the
three
factors
driving
china
s
underlying
import
growth
show
any
sign
of
changing
dramatically
in
the
short
to
medium
term
even
though
china
s
economic
growth
has
softened
slightly
as
the
united
states
imposes
trade
tariffs
it
s
likely
that
stimulus
measures
will
help
to
keep
gross
domestic
product
expanding
at
a
rate
above
percent
it
s
also
likely
that
china
s
domestic
oil
production
will
continue
its
gentle
slide
as
shown
by
the
percent
drop
to
million
bpd
in
the
first
three
quarters
of
the
year
compared
to
the
same
period
a
year
earlier
china
is
also
still
some
way
from
completing
its
goal
of
holding
reserves
equivalent
to
days
of
import
cover
with
the
international
energy
agency
estimating
it
held
million
barrels
at
the
end
of
china
doesn
t
disclose
how
much
crude
it
is
directing
into
its
strategic
reserves
although
various
energy
analysts
believe
it
is
in
the
region
of
bpd
against
this
backdrop
of
solid
underlying
demand
growth
october
added
a
couple
of
factors
that
are
unlikely
to
be
permanent
the
first
is
that
smaller
independent
refiners
were
active
in
the
month
buying
almost
million
bpd
which
is
a
record
high
according
to
data
from
refinitiv
oil
research
and
forecasts
the
independents
were
likely
buying
crude
to
use
up
their
import
quotas
before
they
expired
raising
the
possibility
that
demand
from
this
sector
will
moderate
a
touch
in
coming
months
there
also
seemed
to
be
a
bit
of
rush
to
buy
iranian
crude
before
the
resumption
of
sanctions
against
the
islamic
republic
s
exports
imports
from
iran
were
bpd
in
october
according
to
refinitiv
data
which
was
percent
higher
than
september
s
bpd
the
above
numbers
come
with
a
caveat
insofar
as
it
s
becoming
harder
to
track
iranian
exports
as
the
country
s
tankers
have
started
disabling
their
systems
it
may
have
been
the
case
that
chinese
importers
were
stocking
up
on
iranian
crude
ahead
of
the
renewed
sanctions
this
raises
the
possibility
that
china
may
wind
back
purchases
in
coming
months
especially
since
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
decided
to
grant
waivers
to
eight
buyers
of
iranian
crude
including
top
purchasers
china
and
india
for
a
period
of
six
months
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
china
s
exports
of
refined
products
were
only
slightly
weaker
in
october
than
in
september
with
million
tonnes
being
shipped
down
from
million
this
equates
to
about
million
bpd
of
product
exports
with
chinese
refiners
likely
to
be
keen
to
sell
into
the
strong
regional
market
for
middle
distillates
such
as
diesel
and
jet
fuel
where
the
profit
margins
are
at
or
close
to
highs
china
s
product
exports
are
up
percent
in
the
first
months
of
the
year
compared
to
the
same
period
last
year
overall
the
picture
that
emerges
is
that
china
s
appetite
for
imported
crude
oil
remains
strong
and
growing
and
october
s
record
while
boosted
by
temporary
factors
is
unlikely
to
last
for
too
long
given
the
robust
fundamentals
the
opinions
expressed
here
are
