sanctions
against
iran
s
oil
exports
to
punish
tehran
for
its
involvement
in
several
middle
eastern
conflicts
washington
had
been
pushing
governments
to
cut
imports
of
iranian
oil
to
zero
but
fearing
a
price
spike
it
granted
iran
s
biggest
buyers
china
india
south
korea
japan
italy
greece
taiwan
and
turkey
sanctions
waivers
that
will
allow
the
eight
which
account

of
all
iran
s
oil
exports
according
to
trade
data
to
import
at
least
some
oil
for
another
days
washington
and
the
recipients
of
the

with
the
exception
of

will
average
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
during
the
exemption
period
down
from
a
peak
of
almost
million
bpd
in
morgan
said
the
lack
or
difficulty
in
acquiring
shipping
insurance
will
help
in
reducing
exports
quickly
as
they
did
during
last
international
the
bank
also
said
payments
for
the
oil
by
the
exempt
countries
must
go
into
escrow
accounts
in
their
local
currency
and
that
this
means
the
money
won
t
directly
go
to
iran
and
it
can
only
be
used
to
buy
certain
goods

its
crude
export
once
the
waivers
expire
after
days
new
waivers
are
expected
to
be
issued

during
the
exemption
period
of
days
that
would
be
about
half
the
daily
average
china
has
been
importing
from
iran
since

trade
data

however
one
source
said
the
united

had
attached
strings
to
the

including
counterparty
disclosures
and
laying
open
settlement

which
were
being
evaluated
