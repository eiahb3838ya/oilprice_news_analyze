fukushima tests to help assess cooling of damaged reactors - tepco

the
owner
of
the
fukushima
nuclear
plant
destroyed
by
an
earthquake
and
tsunami
nearly
eight
years
ago
said
on
friday
it
planned
tests
early
next
year
to
see
how
much
melted
uranium
fuel
has
cooled
in
the
damaged
reactors
the
tests
planned
for
january
to
march
will
stop
water
cooling
in
the
reactors
to
analyze
how
the
melted
uranium
core
reacts
and
heats
up
after
cooling
has
stopped

electric
power
all
reactors
need
to
be
cooled
to
limit
the
radioactive
reactions
that
produce
heat
to
generate
electricity
at
fukushima
tepco
cooling
systems
after
the
quake
and
tsunami
wrecked
the
plant
in
march
the
natural
disaster
triggered
meltdowns
at
three
of
the
fukushima
daiichi
plant
s
six
reactors
spewing
radiation
into
the
air
soil
and
ocean
and
forcing
residents
to
flee
many
of
whom
have
not
returned
from
january
tepco
will
begin
to
gradually
reduce
the
amount
of
water
being
pumped
over
the
melted
fuel
in
reactor
no
at
the
site
to
half
the
amount
over
a
week
a
company
spokesman
said
then
tepco
will
resume
full
pumping
but
in
march
the
company
will
stop
all
cooling
for
a
period
to
test
analytical
models
which
have
shown
that
the
reactors
will
not
overheat
he
said
tepco
said
it
would
use
the
test
results
to
better
understand
radioactive
reactions
during
an
emergency
cooling
halt
it
will
also
help
manage
other
water
issues
at
the
site
tepco
has
for
years
struggled
to
control
the
amount
of
water
in
the
basements
of
the
damaged
reactors
groundwater
flowing
from
hills
above
the
plant
enters
the
reactors
where
it
mixes
with
highly
radioactive
debris
the
contaminated
material
is
pumped
out
and
treated
before
being
stored
in
tanks
that
are
quickly
filling
