exclusive-russia clashes with western oil buyers over new deals as sanctions loom
moscow
reuters
russian
energy
majors
are
putting
pressure
on
western
oil
buyers
to
use
euros
instead
of
dollars
for
payments
and
introducing
penalty
clauses
in
contracts
as
moscow
seeks
protection
against
possible
new
sanctions
seven
industry
sources
told
reuters
that
western
oil
majors
and
trading
houses
have
clashed
with
russia
s
third
and
fourth
biggest
producers
gazprom
neft
and
surgutneftegaz
over
oil
sales
contract
terms
during
unusually
tough
annual
renegotiation
in
recent
weeks
the
development
mirrors
a
similar
between
western
buyers
and
russia
s
top
oil
producer
rosneft
earlier
this
week
trading
sources
told
reuters
that
rosneft
wants
western
oil
buyers
to
pay
penalties
from
if
they
fail
to
pay
for
supplies
in
the
event
that
new
sanctions
disrupt
sales
now
sources
have
told
reuters
that
surgutneftegaz
and
gazprom
neft
have
also
clashed
with
their
buyers
over
penalties
and
the
use
of
euros
and
other
currencies
to
replace
the
dollar
in
contracts
it
is
part
of
the
same
trend
the
russian
oil
industry
is
working
on
mitigating
new
sanctions
risks
the
buyers
in
turn
argue
they
can
not
carry
those
risks
so
we
are
trying
to
find
compromises
said
one
source
with
a
western
buyer
involved
in
negotiations
asking
not
to
be
named
as
the
talks
are
confidential
russia
has
been
under
and
eu
sanctions
since
when
it
invaded
ukraine
s
crimean
peninsula
the
sanctions
have
been
repeatedly
widened
to
include
new
companies
and
sectors
making
it
tough
for
russian
oil
firms
to
borrow
money
abroad
raise
new
capital
or
develop
arctic
and
unconventional
deposits
president
vladimir
putin
s
administration
has
been
hoping
for
a
thaw
in
relations
with
the
united
states
since
president
donald
trump
came
to
power
but
washington
has
imposed
new
sanctions
instead
including
on
some
of
russia
s
richest
people
russian
businesses
are
preparing
for
a
new
wave
of
sanctions
expected
in
the
coming
weeks
the
firms
are
trying
to
diversify
away
from
dollar
payments
and
tapping
asia
for
more
of
their
financing
and
technology
needs
according
to
four
industry
sources
surgutneftegaz
asked
buyers
to
be
prepared
to
switch
from
dollar
to
euro
payments
in
contracts
and
insisted
on
buyers
being
effectively
responsible
for
any
losses
arising
from
sanctions
they
basically
said
sanctions
don
t
matter
buyers
have
to
find
a
way
to
pay
or
to
return
purchased
goods
or
pay
penalties
a
source
with
a
big
trading
house
said
gazprom
neft
has
also
asked
buyers
to
use
euros
in
payments
and
bear
financial
responsibility
for
contract
breaches
in
the
case
of
new
sanctions
according
to
three
sources
gazprom
neft
refused
to
comment
surgutneftegaz
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
reuters
request
for
comment
russia
supplies
over
percent
of
global
oil
so
drastic
sanctions
against
it
could
lead
to
a
steep
spike
in
oil
prices
all
global
oil
majors
rely
on
russia
to
feed
their
refineries
especially
in
europe
and
asia
and
hence
they
can
not
just
walk
away
from
annual
contract
negotiations
if
they
are
unhappy
with
terms
talks
with
both
gazprom
neft
and
surgutneftegaz
have
been
progressing
slowly
and
painfully
according
to
trading
sources
several
western
buyers
have
managed
to
agreed
compromises
with
surgutneftegaz
and
gazprom
neft
but
others
are
still
in
tough
talks
with
the
producers
the
sources
said
all
surgutneftegaz
s
contracts
are
bespoke
and
are
negotiated
individually
in
the
siberian
town
of
surgut
by
the
firm
s
management
and
visiting
western
trading
bosses
the
sources
declined
to
name
companies
that
have
already
reached
compromise
deals
in
one
such
compromise
a
large
european
buyer
agreed
to
the
use
of
euros
in
payments
in
exchange
for
surgutneftegaz
dropping
its
demand
for
penalties
from
buyers
who
fail
to
pay
for
cargoes
we
have
been
arguing
that
if
sanctions
make
it
impossible
to
pay
for
an
oil
cargo
how
on
earth
are
we
supposed
to
pay
penalties
one
trading
source
said
so
we
have
agreed
that
the
payment
remains
suspended
for
the
entire
duration
of
sanctions
just
like
it
works
with
iran
