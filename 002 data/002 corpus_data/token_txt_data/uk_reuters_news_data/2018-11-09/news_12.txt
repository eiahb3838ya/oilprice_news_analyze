global
stocks
were
on
pace
for
their
biggest
drop
in
two
weeks
while
oil
prices
weakened
again
on
friday
and
soft
chinese
data
hit
demand
for
risky
assets
stocks
were
broadly
lower
with
energy
shares
falling
more
than
percent
as
benchmark
brent
crude
touched
a
low
and
crude
fell
below
for
the
first
time
since
march
after
entering
a
bear
market
on
thursday
everybody
is
starting
to
look
at
oil
with
a
nervous
eye
it
s
probably
too
early
to
make
any
claims
about
oil
falling
because
of
demand
versus
supply
but
when
you
fall
from
to
it
all
of
a
sudden
makes
people
interested
in
what
is
going
on
in
oil
said
michael
antonelli
managing
director
institutional
sales
trading
at
robert
baird
in
milwaukee
adding
to
pressure
was
data
from
china
which
showed
inflation
slowed
for
the
fourth
month
in
october
on
cooling
domestic
demand
and
manufacturing
activity
on
the
side
producer
prices
rose
more
than
expected
in
october
and
at
their
fastest
pace
in
six
years
but
measures
of
underlying
price
pressure
cooled
bolstering
the
view
that
the
central
bank
is
not
facing
a
resurgence
in
inflation
china
always
is
lurking
in
the
background
they
have
been
on
the
struggle
bus
all
year
and
they
are
still
on
the
struggle
bus
said
antonelli
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
fell
points
or
percent
to
the
s
p
lost
points
or
percent
to
and
the
nasdaq
composite
dropped
points
or
percent
to
world
equities
snapped
a
streak
of
seven
straight
days
of
gains
on
thursday
after
the
federal
reserve
held
interest
rates
steady
but
appeared
to
remain
on
track
to
raise
its
key
interest
rate
next
month
some
investors
had
hoped
that
the
sharp
share
price
falls
during
what
has
been
called
red
october
might
have
encouraged
the
central
bank
to
take
a
more
dovish
approach
towards
monetary
policy
european
shares
were
also
hit
by
the
prospect
of
fed
s
interest
rate
rises
in
the
face
of
a
global
economy
that
has
shown
signs
of
slowing
apart
from
the
united
states
the
stoxx
index
lost
percent
and
msci
s
gauge
of
stocks
across
the
globe
shed
percent
the
dollar
which
had
weakened
sharply
after
elections
was
on
track
to
rise
for
its
second
straight
day
and
was
poised
for
a
fourth
straight
week
of
gains
further
dollar
gains
can
pose
headwinds
for
global
risky
assets
as
that
translates
into
tightening
financial
conditions
as
most
emerging
market
economies
borrow
in
dollars
a
strong
dollar
could
also
hurt
earnings
of
multinational
corporations
the
dollar
index
rose

the

on
thursday
oil
prices
fell
to
lows
as
global
supply
increased
and
investors
worried
about
the
impact
on
fuel
demand
of
lower

growth
