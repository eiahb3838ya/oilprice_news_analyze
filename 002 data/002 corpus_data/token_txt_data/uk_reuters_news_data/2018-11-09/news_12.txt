u.s. ethanol producers feeling the pinch from trump trade war
new

ethanol
producers
drew
a
bleak
picture
of
their
industry
in
quarterly
filings
and
analyst
calls
this
week
detailing
how
the
critical
farm
belt
business
has
been
devastated
by
president
donald
trump
s
trade
war
with
china
and
biofuels
management
policies
that
they
say
have
tilted
toward
oil
refiners
the
ethanol
business
had
grown
for
years
at
breakneck
speed
but
its
outlook
has
dimmed
due
to
washington
s
aggressive
protectionist
stance
and
the
administration
s
unpredictable
management
of
its
renewable
fuel
program
no
ethanol
producer
green

a
net
loss
of

in
the
third

has
idled

to
trim
soaring
inventories
and
boost
margins
it
said
thursday
the
company
recently
sold
three
plants
and
a
vinegar
business
to
help
pay
down
debt
ceo
todd
becker
and
others
noted
that
china
had
been
expected
to
import
million
gallons
of
ethanol
this
year
but
has
instead
been
out
of
the
market
for
months
due
to
trump
s
trade
war
becker
said
chinese
buying
would
wipe
out
the
supply
glut
which
he
estimated
at
about
million
gallons
archer
daniels
midland
co
and
pacific
ethanol
inc
other
big
producers
also
reported
problems
related
to
the
trade
fight
as
recently
as
february
china
was
the
no
global
market
for
ethanol
which
consumes
about
a
third
of
the
domestic
corn
crop
then
beijing
boosted
import
tariffs
on
several
american
agricultural
goods
including
ethanol
soybeans
and
pork
pressuring
prices
for
each
ethanol
futures
of
per
gallon
are
near
the
lowest
in
more
than
a
decade
current
stockpiles
of
million
barrels
million
gallons
are
just
below
a
record
from
earlier
this
year
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
the
ethanol
industry
is
in
a
negative
margin
position
i
wouldn
t
say
there
are
many
plants
that
would
be
positive
even
our
best
plants
becker
said
pacific
ethanol
the
no
ethanol
producer
told
investors
last
week
that
it
idled
percent
of
its
production
capacity
to
battle
high
inventories
and
slumping
margins
its
shares
have
sunk
to
less
than
each
the
economic
run
cuts
will
likely
last
into
next
year
and
may
be
expanded
pacific
ethanol
ceo
neil
koehler
warned
with
china
in
the
mix
it
would
be
a
very
different
market
and
margin
environment
today
koehler
said
in
an
earnings
call
the
company
recorded
a
loss
of
million
in
the
third
quarter
it
slashed
its
capital
budget
deferred
portions
of
debt
payments
and
restructured
loan
terms
to
help
preserve
cash
according
to
its
recent
quarterly
financial
filing
adm
ceo
juan
luciano
the
no
ethanol
producer
said
its
carbohydrate
division
did
well
with
one
exception
the
issue
continues
to
be
ethanol
and
recently
we
have
seen
people
taking
some
capacity
down
but
probably
still
not
enough
luciano
told
analysts
other
major
ethanol
producers
like
flint
hills
resources
and
top
producer
poet
llc
are
privately
held
and
do
not
release
financial
details
the
ethanol
industry
s
view
of
trump
s
biofuels
policy
is
a
mixed
bag
it
has
generally
praised
his
recent
decision
to
lift
a
summer
ban
of
gasoline
blended
with
percent
ethanol
or
that
move
could
expand
the
domestic
market
for
the
fuel
still
ethanol
producers
have
blasted
the
environmental
protection
agency
under
trump
for
granting
waivers
exempting
a
record
number
of
refineries
from
federal
ethanol
blending
requirements
biofuel
companies
have
complained
that
the
move
is
an
expensive
political
gift
to
the
oil
industry
the
truth
is
that
the
waivers
capped
domestic
demand
growth
for
ethanol
and
really
hurt
the
industry
said
geoff
cooper
head
of
the
renewable
fuels
associations
the
ethanol
industry
and
corn
state
lawmakers
have
urged
the
epa
to
stop
issuing
the
waivers
and
to
compensate
for
lost
ethanol
blending
volumes
by
requiring
refineries
to
blend
even
more
the
epa
is
in
the
process
of
finalizing
its
biofuels
blending
volumes
requirements
under
the
renewable
fuel
standard
and
is
expected
to
unveil
them
by
the
end
of
the
month
