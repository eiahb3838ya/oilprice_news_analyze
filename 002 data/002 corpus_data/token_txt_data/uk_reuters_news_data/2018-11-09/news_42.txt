delegation
including
oil
buyers
is
expected
to
head
to
iran
next
week
to
discuss
resuming
iranian
oil
imports
after
a
halt
three
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
south
korea
is
one
of
eight
countries
that
received
waivers
from
the
united
states
to
continue
importing
iranian
oil
for
days
it
can
import
up
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
iranian
oil
mostly
condensate
the
sources
said
without
invoking
economic
sanctions
on
iran
on
the
north
asian
country
was
the
buyer
of
iranian
oil
and
also
the
largest
importer
of
its
condensate
before
it
stopped
imports
in
september
ahead
of
sanctions
south
korea
s
condensate
imports
from
iran
stood
at
bpd
in
down
about
percent
from
bpd
in
the
same
period
last
year
according
to
reuters
calculations
based
on
the
korea
national
oil
corp
knoc
data
condensate
is
an
ultra
light
oil
processed
at
splitters
typically
to
produce
naphtha
for
petrochemicals
while
the
waiver
has
given
south
korea
the
green
light
to
resume
iranian
oil
imports
the
sources
said
issues
such
as
payment
shipping
and
insurance
needed
to
be
worked
out
the
actual
import
volume
will
depend
on
next
week
s
negotiations
one
of
the
sources
said
adding
that
the
oil
s
price
will
be
a
key
factor
the
sanctions
waivers
have
eased
pressure
on
iran
to
further
discount
its
oil

saudi
arabia

a
month
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
the
knoc
data
showed
having
a
waiver
doesn
t
mean
you
have
it
in
your
pocket
you
still
have
to
work

chain
