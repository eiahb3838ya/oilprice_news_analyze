u.s. pipeline operators reap hefty profits from bottlenecks in texas
houston
nov
reuters
some
of
the
biggest
pipeline
operators
in
the
united
states
have
supercharged
earnings
this
year
by
buying
deeply
discounted
shale
in
west
texas
oilfields
and
selling
it
at
a
premium
at
gulf
coast
ports
these
companies
are
taking
advantage
of
extraordinary
markdowns
in
west
texas
where
surging
production
and
a
lack
of
pipeline
space
sent
the
regional
price
for
oil
in
late
august
per
barrel
below
the
coastal
price
in
houston
record
profits
illustrate
the
divide
between
the
haves
those
with
guaranteed
pipeline
space
and
the
have
nots
producers
that
must
sell
oil
at
the
wellhead
production
in
the
permian
basin
of
west
texas
and
new

is
projected
to
hit
million

up
from

years
ago
the
biggest
beneficiary
occidental
petroleum
corp
which
last
quarter
earned
million
from
its
marketing
and
logistics
arm
excluding
asset
sales
compared
with
million
in
the
same
period
last
year
that
profit
was
nearly
four
times
what
the
company
made
last
quarter
pumping
oil
in
the

plains
all
american
pipeline
also
got
a
boost
from
buying
cheap
at
the

and
collecting

that
buys
and
resells

earned
million
last

compared
with
a
loss
of
million
a
year
ago
we
were
able
to
catch
additional
crude
differentials
primarily
around
the
permian
chief
executive
willie
chiang
told
investors
this
week
he
expects
the
discount
to
continue

more
favorable

differentials
between
the

for
lifting
its
profit
by

over

earlier
the

also
is

the
crude
