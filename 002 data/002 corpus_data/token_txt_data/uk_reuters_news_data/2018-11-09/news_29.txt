global
stocks
are
on
track
for
their
biggest
drop
in
two
weeks
while
oil
prices
held
near
lows
on
friday
as
a
confident
central
bank
and
weak
chinese
data
hit
demand
for
risky
assets
while
the
decision
to
hold
interest
rates
by
the
federal
reserve
was
anticipated
by
markets
some
participants
had
expected
a
more
cautious
approach
from
the
central
bank
after
a
stock
market
rout
in
october
that
the
fed
indicated
an
optimistic
view
on
the
economy
despite
the
turbulence
in
stock
markets
in
october
suggests
more
rate
hikes
are
in
store
and
that
is
not
positive
for
risky
assets

rick

said
likely
greater
tightening
in
financial
conditions
could
start
affecting
other
sectors
of
the
economy
such
as
autos
and
small
businesses
european
stocks
were
a
sea
of
red
msci
s
main
european
index
was
down
nearly
percent
and
the
broader
euro
stoxx
fell
percent
stocks
in
hong
kong
and
china
were
the
main
losers
in
asia
where
a
financial
sector
fell
more
than
two
percent
after
china
s
banking
watchdog
told
lenders
to
allocate
at
least
a
third
of
new
loans
to
private
companies
raising
the
prospects
of
a
jump
in
bad
assets
a
confident
fed
also
gave
a
boost
to
the
dollar
which
had
weakened
sharply
after
elections
this
week
raised
the
prospects
of
political
gridlock
friday
s
rise
puts
the
greenback
on
track
for
a
fourth
consecutive
week
of
gains
the
greenback
gained
a
quarter
of
a
percent
against
the
euro
and
half
a
percent
against
the
british
pound
further
dollar
gains
can
also
pose
headwinds
for
global
risky
assets
as
that
translates
into
tightening
global
financial
conditions
as
most
emerging
market
economies

in

the

lower
with

germany
and
the
united
states
softening
across
the
board
pressured
by
world
trade
frictions
and
a
budget
standoff
between
italy
and
brussels
oil
prices
fell
to
lows
as
global
supply
increased
and
investors
worried
about
the
impact
on

down

the

the

said
appetite
for

is
likely
to
remain

unless
there

a
