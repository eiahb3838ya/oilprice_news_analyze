update 6-u.s. judge halts keystone xl oil pipeline in blow to trump, trudeau
winnipeg
york
reuters
a
judge
in
montana
has
blocked
construction
of
the
keystone
xl
pipeline
designed
to
carry
heavy
crude
oil
from
canada
to
the
united
states
drawing
praise
on
friday
from
environmental
groups
and
a
rebuke
from
president
donald
trump
the
ruling
of
a
court
in
montana
late
on
thursday
dealt
a
setback
to
transcanada
corp
whose
stock
fell
percent
in
toronto
shares
of
companies
that
would
ship
oil
on
the
pipeline
also
slid
transcanada
said
in
a
statement
it
remains
committed
to
building
the
billion
mile
km
pipeline
but
it
has
also
said
it
is
seeking
partners
and
has
not
taken
a
final
investment
decision
the
ruling
drew
an
angry
response
from
trump
who
approved
the
pipeline
shortly
after
taking
office
it
also
piles
pressure
on
canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
to
assist
the
country
s
ailing
oil
sector
by
accelerating
crude
shipments
by
rail
until
pipelines
are
built
clogged
pipelines
have
made
discounts
on
canadian
oil
even
steeper
than
they
were
earlier
this
year
when
scotiabank
warned
that
they
may
cost
the
country
s
economy
c
billion
district
court
judge
brian
morris
wrote
that
a
state
department
environmental
analysis
of
keystone
xl
fell
short
of
a
hard
look
at
the
cumulative
effects
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
the
impact
on
native
american
land
resources
it
was
a
political
decision
made
by
a
judge
i
think
it
s
a
disgrace
trump
told
reporters
at
the
white
house
the
ruling
was
a
win
for
environmental
groups
who
sued
the
government
in
after
trump
announced
a
presidential
permit
for
the
project
tribal
groups
and
ranchers
also
have
spent
more
than
a
decade
fighting
the
planned
pipeline
the
trump
administration
tried
to
force
this
dirty
pipeline
project
on
the
american
people
but
they
can
t
ignore
the
threats
it
would
pose
to
our
clean
water
our
climate
and
our
communities
said
the
sierra
club
the
state
department
is
reviewing
the
judge
s
order
and
had
no
comment
due
to
ongoing
litigation
a
spokesman
said
the
pipeline
would
carry
heavy
crude
from
alberta
to
steele
city
nebraska
where
it
would
connect
to
refineries
in
the
midwest
and
gulf
coast
as
well
as
gulf
export
terminals
shares
of
canadian
oil
producers
canadian
natural
resources
ltd
and
cenovus
energy
lost
percent
and
percent
respectively
canada
is
the
primary
source
of
imported
oil
but
congested
pipelines
in
alberta
where
bitumen
is
extracted
have
forced
oil
shippers
to
use
costlier
rail
and
trucks
two
pipeline
projects
have
been
scrapped
due
to
opposition
and
the
trans
mountain
line
project
still
faces
delays
even
after
the
canadian
government
purchased
it
this
year
to
move
it
forward
you
have
to
wonder
how
long
investors
will
tolerate
the
delays
and
whether
the
canadian
government
will
intervene
again
to
protect
the
industry
said
morningstar
analyst
sandy
fielden
ensuring
at
least
one
pipeline
is
built
is
critical
to
trudeau
s
plans
with
a
canadian
election
expected
next
autumn
i
am
disappointed
in
the
court
s
decision
and
i
will
be
reaching
out
to
transcanada
later
on
today
to
show
our
support
to
them
and
understand
what
the
path
forward
is
for

minister
amarjeet
sohi
told
reporters
in
edmonton
alberta
alberta
has
felt
the
financial
pressure
and
an
industry
source
said
the
provincial
government
last
month
solicited
proposals
from
companies
on
ways
to
move
crude
faster
by
rail
the
source
said
proposals
included
ideas
such
as
buying
rail
cars
and
investing
in
loading
terminals
i
ve
never
seen
the
alberta
government
so
active
on
this
front
said
the
source
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
because
the
matter
is
politically
sensitive
that
is
a
alberta
energy
minister
margaret
said
the
province
has
sent
a
proposal
to
ottawa
to
move
crude
faster
by
rail
that
includes
making
more
tank
cars
available
we
re
giving
away
our
resources
cheap

told

minister
bronwyn
eyre
said
people
have
placed
quite
a
lot
of
hope
in
that
keystone
project
so
it
s
a
major
setback
she
said
in
an
interview
morris
in
his
ruling
ordered
the
government
to
issue
a
more
thorough
environmental
analysis
before
the
project
proceeds
he
said
the
analysis
failed
to
fully
review
the
effects
of
the
current
oil
price
on
the
pipeline
s
viability
and
did
not
fully
model
potential
spills
and
offer
mitigation
measures
the
ruling
likely
sets
keystone
back
by
up
to
one
year
