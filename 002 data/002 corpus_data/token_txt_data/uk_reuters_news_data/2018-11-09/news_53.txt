raising

pointing
to
healthy

that
were
marred
only
by
a
dip
in

the

significantly
from

expectations
the
fed
meeting
outcome
and
its

did
not
produce
major
surprises
but
it
managed
to
reinforce

that
a

hike
is
coming
in

and
this
tempered
equities
said
masahiro
ichikawa
senior

at
sumitomo
mitsui
asset
management
in
tokyo
the
fed
statement
came
after
a
steep
surge
in
equities
and
gave
the

an
opportunity
to
sell

the

pushing

tall
after

buoyed
by

struggled
near

as
investors
focused
on
swelling

which
is
increasing

than
many

expected
the

took
stock
of
