more
than
expected
in
october
and
at
their
fastest
pace
in
six
years
but
measures
of
underlying

pressure
cooled
bolstering
the
view
that
the

is
not
facing
a
resurgence
in
inflation
european

dipped
as
mining

oil
stocks

with
a
small

oil
is
spooking
the
market
if
oil
prices
are
going
to
go

that
s
another
sign
that

a
streak

disappointed
some
investors
who
had
hoped
that
the

falls
during
what
has
been
called
red
october
might
have
encouraged
the
