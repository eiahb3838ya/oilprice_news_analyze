low
water
levels
on
the
rhine
river
have
caused
a
fuel
supply
deficit
in
parts
of
europe
s
industrial
heartlands
that
is
sucking
up
cargoes
from
more
than
km
away
in
singapore
following
a
long
scorching
summer
water
levels
on
the
rhine
a
key
commodity
shipping
lane
connecting
industrial
centres
in
switzerland
germany
france
and
the
netherlands
to
major
seaports
fell
to
record
lows
limiting
the
transport
of
coal
steel
grains
and
fuel
that
has
created
a
shortage
of
heating
oil
heading
into
the
european
winter
pushing
up
the
market
and
triggering
a
search
for
supplies
from
as
far
away
as
southeast
asia
where
there
is
ample
fuel
and
gasoil
prices
are
low
northwest
european
prices
for
gasoil
hit
a
record
premium
over
singapore
values
for
november
fuel
deliveries
and
december
premiums
are
still
above
a
tonne
that
means
gasoil
could
be
pulled
into
europe
from
southeast
asia
via
arbitrage
trades
through
the
end
of
the
year
the
wide
arb
means
it
s
possible
to
shift
gasoil
to
the
west
europe
at
a
profit
said
sukrit
vijayakar
director
of
indian
energy
consultancy
trifecta
adding
that
the
situation
stemmed
from
the
low
rhine
water
levels
and
asian
refineries
coming
out
of
turnarounds
the
arbitrage
to
europe
from
asia
is
usually
workable
when
the
price
spread
is
at
least
a
tonne
many
asian
refineries
have
just
come
out
of
maintenance
or
turnarounds
increasing
the
region
s
availability
of
fuels
like
gasoil
gasoil
inventories
held
in
the
ara
refining
and
storage
hub
fell
for
the
fourth
straight
week
to
million
tonnes
the
lowest
volume
since
this
year
according
to
data
from
dutch
consultancy
pjk
international
by
refilling
ara
stocks
with
gasoil
including
from
asia
traders
said
they
hope
to
be
able
to
ship
gasoil
up
the
river
as
soon
as
water
levels
recover
europe
typically
starts
to
stockpile
gasoil
which
is
used
for
heating
in
the
region
ahead
of
the
cold
winter
months
asian
refiners
though
must
act
fast
to
serve
the
european
demand
window
as
american
and
also
russian
suppliers
are
also
eying
the
opportunity
comparing
asian
refiners
with
their
counterparts
the
latter
stand
a
better
chance
to
go
to
europe
as
freight
rates
are
cheaper
and
the
voyage
time
is
very
much
shorter
