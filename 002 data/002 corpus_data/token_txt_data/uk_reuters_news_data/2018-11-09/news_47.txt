analysts
said
the
main
downward
price
pressure
came
from
rising
supply
despite
the
sanctions
against
iran
that
were
imposed
this
week
as
well
as
concerns
over

as

exports

inventories

analysts
at

said
a
slowdown

remains
the
key
downside
risk
to

bernstein
added
the
decline
in
prices
over
the
past
weeks
follows
a
rally
between
august
and
october
when
crude
was
pushed
up
ahead
of
the
of
sanctions
against
iran
s
oil
exports
on
november
these
sanctions
however
will
unlikely
cut
as
much
oil
out
of
the
market
as
initially
expected
as
washington
has
granted
exemptions
to
iran
s
biggest
buyers
which
will
allow
them
to
continue
buying
limited
amounts
of
crude
for
at
least
another
six
months
sanctions
on
iran
are
so
far
proving
to
be
less
severe
than
first
thought
because
the
has
now
issued
waivers
to
a
raft
of
countries
