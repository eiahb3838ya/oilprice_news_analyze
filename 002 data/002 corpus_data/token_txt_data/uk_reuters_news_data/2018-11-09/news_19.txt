a
subsea
power
line
set
to
link
the
networks
of
denmark
and
the
netherlands
reached
the
dutch
coast
on
friday
as
part
of
plans
to
share
excess
electricity
from
wind
farms
and
other
sources
the
km
mile
long
cobracable
short
for
copenhagen
brussels
and
amsterdam
has
a
capacity
of
around
megawatts
mw
and
is
expected
to
become
fully
operational
in
the
third
quarter
of
this
is
an
important
step
towards
the
integration
of
electricity
networks
in
western
europe
said
jeroen
brouwers
spokesman
for
dutch
grid
operator
tennet
we
will
now
have
the
first
link
between
the
netherlands
and
denmark
adding
to
existing
connections
with
norway
and
tennet

million
euros
million
in
the
project
supported
by
a
million
euro
subsidy
from
the
european
commission
as

of
efforts
to
build
a
european
electricity
network
the
link
will
run
from
endrup
in
denmark
to
eemshaven
in
the
netherlands
when
completed
rapid
growth
in
renewable
energy
generation
including
wind
and
solar
has
increased
the
need
for
better
interconnections
between
countries
prompting
grid
operators
across
europe
to
invest
in
new
lines
wind
turbines
already
supply
around
half
of
the
total
electricity
needed
in
denmark
but
last
year
delivered
only
around
percent
of
all
energy
in
the
netherlands
the
dutch
plan
to
build
wind
farms
with
a
capacity
of
up
to
mw
in
its
part
of
the
north
sea
in
the
next
decade
the
dutch
will
by
then
have
passed
the
danes
with
their
capacity
in
wind
energy
brouwers
said
this
network
will
guarantee
the
efficient
use
of
all
that
energy
by
making
it
possible
to
import
and
export
