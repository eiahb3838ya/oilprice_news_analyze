update 2-sse, innogy delay uk retail tie-up as price cap looms
london
reuters
a
deal
to
create
the
uk
s
second
biggest
retail
power
provider
has
been
delayed
to
beyond
the
first
quarter
of
next
year
with
sse
and
innogy
renegotiating
merger
terms
after
britain
s
regulator
proposed
a
cap
on
energy
bills
the
merger
a
major
of
the
uk
power
market
that
would
cut
the
dominant
big
six
firms
to
five
comes
after
the
government
ramped
up
scrutiny
of
britain
s
big
energy
suppliers
which
it
has
accused
of
ripping
off
customers
sse
said
the
two
firms
were
discussing
changes
to
the
terms
of
the
planned
of
their
british
retail
units
and
that
the
deal
was
unlikely
to
be
completed
until
after
the
first
quarter
of
it
did
not
give
a
new
timeframe
for
when
talks
might
be
concluded
it
said
the
talks
were
expected
to
take
place
over
several
weeks
with
an
update
on
progress
to
be
given
by
innogy
said
adjustments
could
include
additional
financial
contributions
by
each
party
the
impact
of
some
recent
market
developments
means
that
the
commercial
terms
associated
with
the
proposed
combination
will
need
to
be
reconsidered
sse
said
in
a
statement
such
developments
include
the
potential
impact
of
the
regulator
s
cap
on
the
most
commonly
used
tariffs
on
the
new
company
s
requirement
to
post
collateral
against
its
credit
exposure
and
its
ability
to
obtain
and
retain
an
appropriate
credit
rating
sse
said
regulator
ofgem
proposed
the
price
cap
on
default
energy
bills
those
to
which
customers
default
once
fixed
price
periods
end
to
save
households
about
billion
pounds
billion
a
year
the
regulator
said
it
will
cap
average
default
electricity
and
gas
bills
at
pounds
a
year
from
a
level
well
below
the
tariffs
set
by
the
country
s
big
six
suppliers
sse
and
npower
innogy
s
british
unit
won
final
regulatory
approval
for
the
last
month
clearing
the
way
for
the
creation
of
a
new
entity
with
around
percent
market
share
the
second
largest
in
the
uk
market
behind
centrica
s
british
gas
with
percent
analysts
said
the
delay
was
a
surprise
since
both
companies
have
known
of
the
impending
price
cap
for
many
months
we
believe
a
cash
injection
into
the
new
entity
is
the
key
driver
for
this
need
to
adjust
commercial
terms
analysts
at
bernstein
said
in
a
research
note
sse
issued
a
profit
warning
in
september
after
the
company
was
hit
by
lower
output
from
its
wind
farms
and
high
gas
prices
npower
has
struggled
to
make
money
from
its
uk
retail
business
an
ofgem
report
last
month
said
the
company
s
margin
for
supply
energy
was
percent
shares
in
sse
were
down
percent
while
shares
in
innogy
slipped
percent
by
gmt
assessing
the
broader
implications
of
the
delay
is
complicated
by
the
convoluted
nature
of
the
european
energy
market
a
planned
asset
swap
between
innogy
s
german
parent
rwe
and
peer
would
see
innogy
s
assets
likely
including
npower
divided
between
the
two
companies
said
on
friday
the
delay
in
the
would
not
lead
to
any
material
impact
on
the
innogy
transaction
