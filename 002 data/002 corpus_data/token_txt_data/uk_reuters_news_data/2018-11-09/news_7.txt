stocks
around
the
globe
were
closing
in
on
their
biggest
drop
in
two
weeks
as
soft
chinese
data
hit
demand
for
risky
assets
while
oil
prices
weakened
again
on
friday
stocks
were
broadly
lower
with
energy
shares
falling
more
than
percent
as
benchmark
brent
crude
touched
a
low
and
crude
fell
below
for
the
first
time
since
march
after
entering
a
bear
market
on
thursday
data
from
china
added
to
the
downward
pressure
showing
inflation
slowed
for
the
fourth
month
in
october
on
cooling
domestic
demand
and
manufacturing
activity
on
the
side
producer
prices
rose
more
than
expected
in
october
and
at
their
fastest
pace
in
six
years
but
measures
of
underlying
price
pressure
cooled
bolstering
the
view
that
the
central
bank
is
not
facing
a
resurgence
in
inflation
european
shares
dipped
as
mining
and
oil
stocks
sold
off
but
they
managed
to
end
the
week
with
a
small
gain
you
have
all
this
data
coming
in
and
you
have
a
lot
of
cross
currents
we
are
in
the
midst
of
that
peaking
process
for
growth
in
the
united
states
and
we
don
t
know
where
things
settle
out
with
regards
to
the
euro
zone

the
dow
jones
industrial
average
fell
points
or
percent
to
the
s
p
lost
points
or
percent
to
and
the
nasdaq
composite
dropped
points
or
percent
to
equities
snapped
a
streak
of
seven
straight
days
of
gains
on
thursday
after
the
federal
reserve
held
interest
rates
steady
but
appeared
to
remain
on
track
to
raise
its
key
interest
rate
next
month
some
investors
had
hoped
that
the
sharp
share
price
falls
during
what
has
been
called
red
october
might
have
encouraged
the
central
bank
to
take
a
more
dovish
approach
toward
monetary
policy
the
stoxx
index
lost
percent
and
msci
s
gauge
of
stocks
across
the
globe
shed
percent
the
dollar
which
had
weakened
sharply
after
tuesday
s
elections
was
up
for
a
second
straight
day
and
on
track
for
a
fourth
straight
week
of
gains
further
dollar
gains
can
pose
headwinds
for
risky
assets
as
that
translates
into
tightening
financial
conditions
as
most
emerging
market
economies
borrow
in
dollars
a
strong
dollar
could
also
hurt
earnings
of
multinational
corporations
the
dollar
index
rose
percent
with
the

the

weakness

in
price
to

percent
from

late
on
thursday
oil
prices
fell
to
lows
as
global
supply
increased
and
investors
worried
about
the
possibility
of
slowing
fuel
demand
putting
crude
on
track
for
the
longest
stretch
of
daily
declines
since
west
texas
intermediate
crude
fell
percent
to
per
barrel
and
brent
was
last
at
down

the
