insight-stung by asian dominance, germany pours cash into ev battery ventures
berlin
reuters
germany
has
earmarked
billion
euros
billion
to
support
a
consortium
looking
to
produce
electric
car
battery
cells
and
plans
to
fund
a
research
facility
to
develop
batteries
three
sources
told
reuters
the
measures
expected
to
be
announced
next
week
are
designed
to
reduce
the
dependence
of
german
carmakers
on
asian
electric
vehicle
ev
battery
suppliers
and
protect
german
jobs
at
risk
from
the
shift
away
from
combustion
engines
berlin
s
push
to
shape
industrial
policy
marks
a
break
with
its
generally
hands
off
approach
to
business
decisions
and
is
part
of
european
efforts
to
forge
battery
alliances
to
counter
the
dominance
of
chinese
japanese
and
korean
firms
ensuring
local
companies
are
involved
throughout
the
electric
vehicle
supply
chain
is
particularly
important
for
germany
as
it
has
become
so
economically
dependent
on
the
success
of
its
car
industry
but
germany
s
car
battery
push
could
be
too
late
asian
market
leaders
are
ramping
up
output
and
some
experts
say
there
s
a
risk
of
a
glut
that
could
hinder
the
establishment
of
battery
cell
production
by
european
newcomers
for
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
fractious
ruling
coalition
the
plan
is
also
a
way
to
show
voters
ahead
of
three
elections
next
year
in
eastern
germany
that
it
can
get
its
act
together
to
help
europe
s
largest
economy
thrive
in
the
electric
car
era
we
have
a
concentration
of
risk
in
the
automobile
sector
the
industry
is
too
dependent
on
the
combustion
engine
deputy
economy
minister
christian
hirte
told
reuters
the
government
therefore
wants
to
help
the
sector
in
its
efforts
to
hirte
said
berlin
was
in
talks
with
several
companies
and
other
governments
in
europe
to
support
a
battery
cell
factory
there
are
possibilities
for
example
in
the
lausitz
region
maybe
in
cooperation
with
poland
said
hirte
who
is
the
government
s
coordinator
for
eastern
german
affairs
and
for
and
enterprises
policy
one
thing
is
clear
you
can
not
ignore
east
germany
if
you
are
planning
such
mega
projects
there
is
a
lot
of
space
and
the
acceptance
among
the
population
is
companies
involved
in
talks
with
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
about
building
a
factory
include
german
battery
maker
varta
microbattery
chemical
giant
basf
and
ford
s
german
subsidiary
gmbh
three
people
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
a
spokeswoman
for
basf
said
it
would
attend
a
meeting
with
altmaier
next
week
varta
and
ford
declined
to
comment
varta
specializes
in
batteries
for
hearing
aids
and
large
storage
systems
for
solar
energy
it
said
last
month
it
was
studying
the
production
of
large
lithium
batteries
and
was
in
intensive
discussions
with
relevant
market
actors
volkswagen
s
supervisory
board
is
due
to
discuss
its
electric
car
and
battery
cell
strategy
at
a
meeting
on
the
german
carmaker
has
said
in
the
past
that
it
was
studying
battery
cell
production
at
its
plant
in
salzgitter
a
source
told
reuters
on
thursday
that
the
board
would
discuss
a
alliance
with
south
korean
battery
cell
maker
sk
innovation
some
analysts
say
europe
is
already
too
far
behind
in
the
race
with
asian
firms
at
least
with
the
current
technology
boston
consulting
group
bcg
for
example
has
estimated
global
battery
cell
production
capacity
will
exceed
demand
by
about
percent
in
exerting
massive
pressure
on
prices
and
making
it
hard
for
new
entrants
to
make
money
south
korea
s
lg
chem
is
already
supplying
some
german
carmakers
with
ev
batteries
made
in
poland
while
samsung
sdi
co
and
sk
innovation
are
planning
factories
in
hungary
the
announcement
by
the
world
s
biggest
ev
battery
maker
china
s
contemporary
amperex
technology
ltd
catl
that
it
would
build
its
first
european
plant
in
eastern
germany
and
has
struck
a
deal
with
german
carmaker
bmw
has
been
welcomed
by
the
government
but
merkel
told
business
leaders
it
was
extremely
important
germany
also
develops
its
own
battery
cell
capacity
to
secure
the
country
s
role
in
the
car
industry
for
years
german
car
bosses
have
been
reluctant
to
push
ahead
with
electric
cars
instead
focusing
on
diesel
engines
but
they
now
face
a
challenge
to
make
combustion
engines
comply
with
tougher
emissions
rules
introduced
following
the
emissions
cheating
scandal
that
engulfed
volkswagen
despite
bcg
s
predictions
of
a
glut
analysts
at
consultants
mckinsey
company
and
germany
s
fraunhofer
institute
say
there
will
be
room
for
european
newcomers
as
demand
is
likely
to
outstrip
supply
when
automakers
ramp
up
ev
production
german
carmakers
have
warned
however
that
jobs
could
disappear
because
it
takes
less
time
to
build
electric
cars
and
as
positions
shift
overseas
to
foreign
battery
makers
germany
s
vda
auto
industry
association
has
said
a
ban
on
combustion
vehicles
in
would
threaten
jobs
at
car
companies
and
their
suppliers
battery
cells
are
a
key
technology
and
an
important
part
of
the
value
chain
that
s
why
we
want
to
locate
this
in
germany
hirte
said
recognizing
the
importance
of
a
homegrown
battery
industry
for
jobs
and
profits
the
european
commission
launched
its
own
european
battery
alliance
eba
in
but
sweden
s
northvolt
is
seen
as
the
only
serious
contender
to
emerge
so
far
as
part
of
berlin
s
push
economy
minister
altmaier
is
talking
to
german
and
european
companies
as
well
as
neighboring
countries
to
try
to
join
forces
he
is
coordinating
his
efforts
with
brussels
to
resolve
any
state
aid
and
antitrust
issues
in
a
few
years
europe
will
have
a
competitive
battery
cell
sector
that
can
survive
without
state
aid
altmaier
said
in
september
after
meeting
the
eu
s
for
energy
union
maros
sefcovic
who
has
been
the
driving
force
behind
the
eba
altmaier
is
expected
to
announce
more
details
of
his
battery
cells
plan
during
a
conference
in
berlin
starting
on
that
will
be
attended
by
sefcovic
the
billion
euros
earmarked
for
a
german
battery
cells
consortium
would
help
establish
a
first
factory
probably
in
western
germany
two
sources
familiar
with
the
plans
said
berlin
is
also
willing
to
support
a
second
plant
possibly
in
the
lausitz
region
near
the
border
where
two
of
the
regional
elections
in
will
take
place
they
said
an
economy
ministry
spokeswoman
said
altmaier
was
in
talks
with
all
relevant
parties
and
no
decisions
had
been
made
in
addition
the
government
wants
to
spend
up
to
million
euros
to
a
research
factory
to
help
put
german
companies
ahead
of
the
curve
when
batteries
are
ready
for
the
mass
market
another
source
told
reuters
batteries
are
likely
to
be
overtaken
in
a
matter
of
years
by
technology
that
is
expected
to
produce
cheaper
batteries
with
higher
energy
density
the
location
of
the
research
factory
has
not
been
decided
and
the
government
is
about
to
start
a
tender
process
in
which
authorities
and
firms
can
pitch
for
the
site
the
source
said
a
science
ministry
spokesman
said
the
government
was
supporting
efforts
to
develop
solid
state
batteries
by
bringing
together
leading
research
institutes
with
the
private
sector
companies
involved
in
the
network
known
as
festbatt
include
varta
basf
volkswagen
bmw
car
parts
maker
continental
conglomerate
thyssenkrupp
carbon
fiber
specialist
sgl
carbon
belgian
materials
firm
umicore
coperion
and
heraeus
the
spokesman
said
for
now
german
carmakers
are
sourcing
battery
cells
predominantly
from
asian
suppliers
such
as
catl
lg
chem
and
samsung
sdi
although
bmw
has
struck
a
partnership
with
northvolt
underlining
the
uphill
battle
german
firms
face
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
automotive
suppliers
bosch
has
opted
out
of
making
cells
saying
it
would
be
too
costly
henning
an
electric
mobility
researcher
at
fraunhofer
is
less
pessimistic
if
automakers
boost
their
electric
car
production
to
to
percent
of
total
sales
in
coming
years
europe
will
need
battery
cell
factories
with
more
than
gigawatt
hours
he
said
well
above
the
capacity
planned
by
asian
producers
so
far
we
ll
need
far
more
battery
cells
in
europe
and
this
must
happen
pretty
fast
indeed
henning
said
the
expected
shift
to
batteries
could
also
make
european
suppliers
less
dependent
on
the
rare
earth
resources
largely
controlled
by
china
that
are
used
in
cells
the
landscape
will
change
dramatically
in
coming
years
