a
federal
judge
in
montana
halted
construction
of
transcanada
corp
s
keystone
xl
oil
pipeline
on
thursday
saying
a
environmental
analysis
fell
short
of
a
hard
look
at
the
cumulative
effects
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
the
impact
on
native
american
land
resources
the
ruling
is
the
latest
delay
to
the
project
a
decade
in
planning
which
was
revived
by
president
donald
trump
after
being
halted
by
his
predecessor
barack
obama
kxl
as
it
is
known
is
a
proposed
billion
mile
km
pipeline
that
would
carry
heavy
crude
to
steele
city
nebraska
from
canada
s
oil
sands
in
alberta
planned
by
canada
s
transcanada
kxl
would
provide
a
shortcut
to
carry
more
canadian
oil
to
markets
complementing
the
existing
keystone
line
than
runs
from
alberta
to
steele
city
and
then
gulf
coast
refineries
crude
production
in
alberta
s
oil
sands
is
expanding
faster
than
pipeline
capacity
creating
a
bottleneck
that
has
driven
down
prices
canada
s
heavy
crude
now
fetches
a
fraction
of
the
benchmark
light
oil
price
and
some
producers
have
curtailed
production
the
steep
discount
has
stripped
billions
of
dollars
from
the
canadian
economy
by
some
estimates
environmental
groups
have
campaigned
against
pipelines
to
carry
crude
from
canada
s
oil
sands
saying
extraction
methods
used
in
the
region
harm
the
environment
more
than
conventional
oil
drilling
in
nebraska
landowners
blasted
what
they
saw
as
efforts
by
transcanada
to
force
the
pipe
through
ecologically
sensitive
areas
obama
a
democrat
axed
the
project
in
saying
canada
would
reap
most
of
the
economic
benefits
while
the
project
would
add
to
greenhouse
gas
emissions
president
donald
trump
a
republican
pushed
to
approve
kxl
soon
after
he
took
office
saying
it
would
create
jobs
in
a
presidential
permit
allowed
the
line
to
move
forward
and
several
environmental
groups
sued
the
government
the
nebraska
public
service
commission
issued
an
approval
late
last
year
for
an
alternative
route
a
ruling
that
environmental
groups
are
challenging
in
washington
the
judge
s
ruling
on
thursday
was
a
blow
to
trump
who
critics
say
is
trying
to
force
an
unpopular
project
on
the
american
people
in
ottawa
pressure
is
mounting
on
canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
to
get
a
pipeline
built
to
help
canadian
producers
sell
their
oil
at
higher
prices
while
building
support
for
other
steps
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
before
an
election
expected
next
year
in
summer
trudeau
s
government
bought
the
floundering
trans
mountain
pipeline
project
hoping
to
get
it
built
district
court
judge
brian
morris
ordered
the
federal
government
to
conduct
a
more
thorough
environmental
analysis
separately
transcanada
has
said
it
expects
a
decision
on
routing
from
the
nebraska
supreme
court
by
the
first
quarter
of
transcanada
has
yet
to
make
a
final
investment
decision
to
proceed
with
the
project
even
though
it
had
started
construction
it
said
last
week
that
it
is
also
seeking
partners
to
finance
