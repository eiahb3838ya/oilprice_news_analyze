california-based appeals court has been thorn in trump's side
nov
reuters
a
federal
appeals
court
that
has
often
ruled
against
president
donald
trump
dealt
him
another
setback
this
week
in
a
major
immigration
case
and
soon
could
be
asked
to
weigh
in
on
a
pipeline
project
he
has
championed
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
based
in
san
francisco
has
been
a
thorn
in
trump
s
side
since
he
took
office
last
year
and
has
drawn
the
republican
president
s
ire
for
its
decisions
in
cases
his
latest
setback
before
the
circuit
came
on
thursday
when
a
panel
rejected
his
bid
to
rescind
a
program
launched
by
his
democratic
predecessor
barack
obama
that
protects
from
deportation
hundreds
of
thousands
of
illegal
immigrants
brought
into
the
country
as
children
the
circuit
has
handed
him
defeats
on
his
travel
ban
targeting
people
from
several
countries
and
his
bid
to
withhold
federal
funds
from
sanctuary
cities
that
limit
cooperation
on
immigration
enforcement
it
also
is
set
to
rule
on
the
administration
s
appeal
of
a
judge
s
order
blocking
trump
s
move
to
put
restrictions
on
transgender
people
serving
in
the
military
the
circuit
would
hear
any
appeal
by
trump
s
administration
of
the
ruling
late
on
thursday
by
a
federal
judge
in
montana
blocking
construction
for
environmental
reasons
of
the
keystone
xl
pipeline
project
that
is
designed
to
carry
heavy
crude
oil
from
canada
to
the
united
states
the
justice
department
said
on
friday
it
is
reviewing
the
keystone
xl
ruling
to
decide
its
next
step
transcanada
corp
said
it
remains
committed
to
building
the
billion
pipeline
the
circuit
is
an
easy
punching
bag
for
trump
because
not
only
has
it
been
traditionally
liberal
but
california
is
its
beating
heart
and
we
all
know
how
trump
fares
in
california
said
barry
mcdonald
a
law
professor
at
pepperdine
university
in
malibu
he
probably
sees
much
of
the
west
coast
as
a
nemesis
for
california
the
most
populous
state
is
a
liberal
bastion
that
is
unfriendly
political
territory
for
trump
the
president
regularly
belittles
the
circuit
as
he
did
on
friday
after
the
court
s
ruling
preserving
the
deferred
action
for
childhood
arrivals
daca
program
the
daca
will
now
hopefully
go
to
the
supreme
court
where
it
will
be
given
a
fair
decision
trump
told
reporters
trump
already
has
appointed
two
justices
to
the
supreme
court
solidifying
its
conservative
majority
the
circuit
has
judges
who
were
appointed
by
democratic
presidents
and
seven
who
were
named
by
republican
presidents
democratic
presidents
tend
to
appoint
more
liberal
jurists
while
republican
presidents
favor
more
conservatives
judges
it
is
one
of
the
series
of
powerful
regional
federal
appeals
courts
that
are
one
step
below
the
supreme
court
these
circuit
courts
often
provide
the
last
word
in
a
legal
dispute
because
the
supreme
court
hears
only
a
limited
number
of
cases
the
circuit
hears
appeals
in
federal
cases
spanning
a
huge
region
in
terms
of
both
geography
and
population
covering
the
states
of
alaska
arizona
california
hawaii
idaho
montana
nevada
oregon
and
washington
trump
already
has
named
two
judges
to
the
circuit
with
six
other
vacancies
waiting
to
be
filled
trump
will
not
be
able
to
create
a
conservative
majority
on
the
circuit
however
without
additional
vacancies
caused
when
actively
presiding
judges
retire
aided
by
fellow
republicans
in
the
senate
trump
has
made
it
a
top
priority
to
rapidly
appoint
judges
in
a
bid
to
make
the
federal
judiciary
more
conservative
trump
has
suggested
his
policies
do
not
get
a
fair
shake
in
the
circuit
and
has
touted
the
idea
of
breaking
up
that
court
trump
last
year
decried
the
circuit
s
ridiculous
ruling
on
the
travel
ban
and
said
that
court
has
a
terrible
record
of
being
overturned
by
the
supreme
court
an
charge
that
the
circuit
s
chief
judge
took
issue
with
in
congressional
testimony
for
a
graphic
showing
trump
s
impact
on
federal
appeals
courts
