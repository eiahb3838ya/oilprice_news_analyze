there

to
suggest
things

pick
up
soon
things
don
t
look
good
all
the
way
to
the
end

the
year
because
of
weakness
in
the
market
and
the
high
base
for
comparison
from
last
year

adding
he
was
watching
to
see
if
car
makers
made
a
push
to
spur
sales
if
the
oems
give
up
then
sales
volumes
could
be
really
the

a
driver
of
growth
china

also
a
major
employer
economic

driver
and

open
their
purse

car
dealers
have
