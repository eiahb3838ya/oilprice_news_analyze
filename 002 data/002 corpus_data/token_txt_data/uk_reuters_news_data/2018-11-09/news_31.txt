global
stocks
were
heading
for
their
biggest
drop
in
two
weeks
and
emerging
market
currencies
also
slipped
on
friday
as
a
confident
central
bank
and
weak
chinese
data
hit
demand
for
risky
assets
msci
s
gauge
of
stocks
across
the
globe
fell
half
a
percent
its
biggest
drop
since
as
the
federal
reserve
held
interest
rates
as
expected
but
indicated
that
another
rate
increase
is
likely
in
december
while
the
decision
to
hold
rates
was
anticipated
by
markets
some
participants
had
expected
a
more
cautious
approach
from
the
central
bank
after
a
stock
market
rout
in
october
but
the
fed
indicated
a
december
increase
is
a
distinct
possibility
in
a
robust
economy
that
contrasts
sharply
with
china
where
cooling
producer
price
inflation
and
falling
car
sales
suggested
an
economy
struggling
to
gain
traction
worries
about
trade
wars
and
how
the
slowdown
in
china
will
impact
the
rest
of
the
world
mean
stocks
appear
to
be
more
risky
so
there
s
a
typical
move
in

today

stocks
in
hong
kong
and
china
were
the
main
losers
in
asia
where
a
financial
sector
fell
more
than
percent
after
china
s
banking
watchdog
told
lenders
to
allocate
at
least
a
third
of
new
loans
to
private
companies
raising
the
prospects
of
a
jump
in
bad
assets
european
stocks
followed
asia
lower
with
main
indexes
opening
in
the
red
though
a
batch
of
company
earnings
and
uk
gdp
data
might
offer
some
support
later
in
the
session
msci
s
main
european
index
was
down
nearly
percent
and
the
broader
euro
stoxx
fell
percent
a

also
gave
a
boost
to
the
dollar
which
had
weakened
sharply
after

this
week
raised
the
prospects
of

gridlock
the

a
quarter

against
the

the

the

pressured
by

trade
frictions
and
a

standoff
between
italy
and

oil
prices
fell
to
lows
as
global

increased
and

worried
about
the

down
more

the

still
market
watchers
said
appetite
for
equities
is
likely
to
remain
firm
unless
there
is
a
big

a
spike
in
volatility
