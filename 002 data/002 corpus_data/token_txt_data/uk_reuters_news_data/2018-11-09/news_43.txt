factbox-plans for electric vehicle battery production in europe
nov
reuters
germany
has
earmarked
billion
euros
billion
to
support
a
consortium
looking
to
produce
electric
car
battery
cells
and
plans
to
fund
a
research
facility
to
develop
batteries
three
sources
told
reuters
the
measures
expected
to
be
announced
by
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
next
week
are
designed
to
reduce
the
dependence
of
german
carmakers
on
asian
battery
suppliers
and
protect
german
jobs
at
risk
from
the
shift
away
from
combustion
engines
below
are
details
of
plans
to
establish
electric
vehicle
ev
battery
plants
in
europe
northvolt
the
swedish
company
headed
by
a
former
tesla
executive
aims
to
build
europe
s
biggest
battery
factory
producing
gigawatt
hours
gwh
of
battery
cells
a
year
by
rivalling
tesla
s
gigafactory
it
has
partnered
with
german
carmaker
bmw
ahead
of
plans
to
raise
billion
euros
in
debt
and
equity
to
build
an
initial
gwh
of
capacity
and
has
asked
for
a
million
euro
loan
from
the
european
investment
bank
german
industrial
giant
siemens
is
helping
to
build
the
factory
northvolt
will
become
its
preferred
supplier
for
batteries
when
production
starts
in
northvolt
is
also
planning
a
factory
in
poland
to
produce
battery
systems
for
energy
storage
companies
and
the
mining
industry
the
plant
in
gdansk
would
take
cells
from
the
swedish
factory
and
use
them
to
develop
battery
systems
or
modules
a
northvolt
spokesman
said
the
company
was
not
involved
in
talks
to
forge
a
consortium
but
he
said
northvolt
would
welcome
more
alliances

to
accompany
its
first

co
catl
said
in
july
it
would
build
its
first
production
site
in
europe
in
germany
and
the
plant
would
supply
carmaker
bmw
with
batteries
bmw
plans
to
source
billion
euros
of
battery
cells
from
catl
over
the
next
few
years
with
billion
euros
coming
from
the
new
site
in

in
eastern
germany
the

byd
is
considering

production
in
europe
an
executive
told
reuters
earlier
this
year
adding
it
was
not
clear
where
it
might
be
located
the

plans
to
produce
ev
batteries
per
year
at
its
new
polish
factory
near
the
western
city
of
wroclaw
km
miles
from

audi
porsche
and
daimler
it
has
also
secured
a
contract
to
supply
batteries
for
germany
s
volkswagen
starting
in
late
the
factory
s
planned
output
of
battery
cells
is
equivalent
to
roughly
gwh
per
year
which
means
the
plant
s
capacity
is
just
a
fraction
of
expected
future
demand
in
europe

said
in
january
it
would
set
up
a
factory
in
hungary
that
would
assemble
lithium

batteries
and
would
consider
producing
cells
on
the
site
in
the
future
south

s
samsung
sdi
co
started
production
at
a
new
factory
near
budapest
this
year
that
is
expected
to
produce
batteries
for
electric
vehicles
a
year
samsung
sdi
an
affiliate
of
samsung
electronics
co
ltd
also
produces
rechargeable
batteries
for
electronic
devices
such
as
smartphones
and
energy

s
sk
innovation
plans
to
break
ground
this
year
on
a
battery
plant
in
hungary
and
launch
production
from
producing
gwh
of
batteries
per
year
sk
innovation
started
as
korea
oil
corporation
and
owns
south

saft
france
s
saft
owned
by
energy
company
total
produces
a
range
of
batteries
including
for
power
and
industrial
applications
but
not
for
electric
vehicles
in
february
it
created
an
alliance
with
german
industrial
group
siemens
solvay
and
manz
to
develop
a
new
generation
of
batteries
the
group
will
focus
on
advanced
and
technology
targeting
the
market
for
electric
vehicles
railway
marine
sectors
among
others
a
saft
spokesman
said
the
company
was
not
participating
in
germany
s
summit
on
and
that
saft
was
not
aware
of
another
multinational
battery
cell
alliance
terrae
the
consortium
of
companies
and
research
institutions
announced
plans
last
year
to
build
two
foundries
where
battery
cells
are
produced
to
customers
specifications
it
said
its
two
planned
factories
would
have
a
capacity
of
gwh
by
which
would
top
northvolt
s
plans
but
the
consortium
has
run
into
liquidity
problems
as
companies
shied
away
from
investing
industry
sources
told

so
the
future
of
terrae
remains
unclear
a
spokesman
of
terrae
did
not
respond
when
asked
by

to
give
an
update
of
its

car
and
battery
cell
strategy
at
a
meeting
on
the
german
carmaker
has
said
in
the
past
that
it
was
studying
battery
cell
production
at
its
plant
in
salzgitter
a
source
told
reuters
on
thursday
that
the
board
would
discuss
a
alliance
with
south
korean
battery
cell
maker
sk
innovation
bmw
is
establishing
a
technology
consortium
with
northvolt
and
belgium
s
umicore
to
develop
a
value
chain
for
battery
cells
in
europe
including
development
production
and
ultimately
recycling
the
company
has
also
said
it
will
purchase
specific
raw
materials
such
as
cobalt
and
then
make
them
available
to
battery
cell
suppliers
as
a
way
to
secure
a
supply
of
electric
car
batteries
daimler
said
it
would
add
battery
manufacturing
capabilities
to
its
plants
in
sindelfingen
and
untertuerkheim
in
the
southern
state
of
the
company
is
already
assembling
batteries
in
its
kamenz
plant
in
the
eastern
state
of
saxony
but
the
factory
relies
on
imported
battery
cells
german
auto
parts
and
tyre
maker
continental
ag
formed
a
joint
venture
in
march
with
chinese
auto
parts
supplier
citc
to
produce
mild
hybrid
batteries
in
china
continental
also
said
it
was
considering
making
ev
batteries
using
technology
but
for
was
holding
out
for
