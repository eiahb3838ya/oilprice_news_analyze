on
saturday
it
was
pulling
out
of
iran
for
fear
of
becoming
entangled
in
sanctions
and
president
hassan
rouhani
demanded
that
european
countries
to
do
more
to
offset
the
measures
the
announcement
by
france
s
cma
cgm
that
it
was
quitting
iran
deals
a
blow
to
tehran
s
efforts
to
persuade
european
countries
to
keep
their
companies
operating
in
iran
despite
the
threat
of
new
american
sanctions
iran
says
it
needs
more
help
from
europe
to
keep
alive
an
agreement
with
world
powers
to
curb
its
nuclear
programme
president
donald

abandoned

on
tehran
washington
has
ordered
all

buying
iranian

by
november
and
foreign

to
stop
doing
business
there

face
blacklists
european
powers
which
still
support
the
nuclear
deal
say
they
will
do
more
to
encourage
their
businesses
to
remain
engaged
with
iran
but
the
prospect
of
being
banned
in
the
united
states
appears
to
be
enough
to
persuade
european
companies
to
keep
out
foreign
ministers
from
the
five
remaining
signatory
countries
to
the
nuclear
deal
britain
france
germany
china
and
russia
offered
a
package
of
economic
measures
to
iran
on
friday
but
tehran
said
they
did
not
go
far
enough
european
countries
have
the
political
will
to
maintain
economic
ties
with
iran
based
on
the
jcpoa
the
nuclear
deal
but
they
need
to
take
practical
measures
within
the
time
limit

said
on
saturday

his
official
website
cma
cgm

third
largest
container
shipping
fleet
with
more
than
percent
of
global
capacity
said
it
would
halt
service
for
iran
as
it
did
not
want
to
fall
foul
of
the
rules
given
its
large
presence
in
the
united
states
due
to
the
trump
administration
we
have
decided
to
end
our
service
for
iran

saade
said
during
an
economic
conference
in
the
southern
french
city
of
our
chinese

hesitating
a
little
so

they
have
a
different
relationship
with
trump
but
we
apply
the
rules

also
echoed

our

quoted
as
saying

gulf
in
retaliation
for
efforts
to
reduce

oil
sales
to
zero
rouhani
himself
made
a

threat
along
those
lines
in

exports
from
