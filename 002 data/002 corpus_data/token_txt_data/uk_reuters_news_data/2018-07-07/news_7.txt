wrapup 13-duelling tariffs raise fears of long u.s.-china trade battle
reuters
the
united
states
and
china
exchanged
the
first
salvos
in
what
could
become
a
protracted
trade
war
on
friday
slapping
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
each
others
goods
and
giving
no
sign
of
willingness
to
start
talks
aimed
at
a
reaching
a
truce
duties
on
a
range
of
chinese
goods
imported
into
the
united
states
took
effect
on
friday
and
were
immediately
countered
by
measures
from
china
with
beijing
accusing
the
united
states
of
triggering
the
trade
war
the
escalating
fight
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
meant
that
it
could
take
economic
and
political
pain
to
get
these
two
parties
to
the
negotiating
table

scott
kennedy
head
of
china
studies
at
the
center
for
strategic
and
international
studies
in
washington
president
donald
trump
is
already
threatening
additional
rounds
of
tariffs
possibly
targeting
more
than
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
roughly
the
total
amount
of
imports
from
china
last
year
it
will
take
weeks
or
months
for
the
trade
representative
to
review
and
possibly
activate
any
new
rounds
of
punishment
the
key
questions
during
that
time
are
what
will
happen
to
financial
markets
how
will
voters
react
and
will
china
s
economy
start
to
wobble
kennedy
said
in
a
telephone
interview
erin
ennis
senior
vice
president
of
the
china
business
council
said
there
was
a
danger
the
two
sides
will
dig
in
on
trade
sanctions
without
a
clear
strategy
for
resuming
negotiations
while
companies
doing
business
in
china
agree
with
trump
s
complaint
about
chinese
intellectual
property
practices
ennis
said
they
do
not
see
tariffs
pushing
china
into
submission
china
s
commerce
ministry
said
it
was
forced
to
retaliate
meaning
imported
goods
including
cars
soybeans
and
lobsters
also
faced
percent
tariffs
some
of
trump
s
fellow
republicans
in
the
congress
lashed
out
at
his
actions
tariffs
not
only
hurt
our
farmers
ranchers
and
airplane
manufacturers
but
they
also
harm
every
american
consumer
we
should
be
working
with
our
allies
to
isolate
china
rather
than
escalate
a
trade
war

recovering
most
of

confusion
over
whether
beijing
had
actually
implemented
the
tariffs
which
it
later
confirmed
it
had
friday
s
china
tariff
volley
fueled
fear
that
a
prolonged
and
escalating
battle
would
hurt
global
trade
investment
and
growth

also
damaging

potentially
driving
