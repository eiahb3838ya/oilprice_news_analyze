reuters
mexican
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
will
seek
to
end
the
country
s
massive
fuel
imports
nearly
all
from
the
united
states
during
the
first
three
years
of
his
term
while
also
boosting
refining
at
home
the
landslide
winner
of
last
sunday
s
election
told
reporters
on
saturday
morning
before
attending
private
meetings
with
members
of
his
future
cabinet
that
he
will
also
prioritize
growing
crude
oil
production
domestically
which
has
fallen
sharply
for
years
the
objective
is
that
we
stop
buying
foreign
gasoline
by
the
half
way
point
of
my
term
said
lopez
obrador
repeating
a
position
he
and
his
senior
energy
advisor
staked
out
during
the
campaign
we
are
going
to
immediately
revive
our
oil
activity
exploration
and
the
drilling
of
wells
so
we
have
crude
oil
he
said
on
the
campaign
trail
the
leftist
former
mayor
of
mexico
city
pitched
his
plan
to
wean
the
country
off
foreign
gasoline
as
a
means
to
increasing
domestic
production
of
crude
and
fuels
not
as
a
trade
issue
with
the
united
states
lopez
obrador
also
reiterated
on
saturday
his
goal
to
build
either
one
large
or
two
oil
refineries
during
his
term
which
begins
on
december
while
he
said
the
facilities
will
be
built
in
the
gulf
coast
states
of
tabasco
and
possibly
campeche
he
has
been
less
clear
on
how
the
refineries
would
be
funded
so
far
this
year
mexico
has
imported
an
average
of
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
gasoline
and
another
bpd
of
diesel
as
output
at
the
country
s
domestic
refineries
has
steadily
declined
foreign
gasoline
imports
have
grown
by
nearly
while
diesel
imports
have
more
than
doubled
since
the
first
year
of
outgoing
president
enrique
pena
nieto
s
term
according
to
data
from
national
oil
company
pemex
meanwhile
the
six
oil
refineries
in
mexico
owned
and
operated
by
pemex
are
producing
at
far
below
their
capacity
or
an
average
of
bpd
of
gasoline
so
far
this
year
gasoline
production
at
the
facilities
is
down
percent
compared
to
and
domestic
gasoline
output
only
accounts
for
slightly
more
than
a
quarter
of
national
demand
from
the
country
s
legions
of
motorists
during
the
campaign
the
presidential
also
promised
to
strengthen
pemex
he
also
was
sharply
critical
of
a
constitutional
energy
overhaul
that
ended
the
company
s
monopoly
and
allowed
international
oil
majors
to
operate
fields
on
their
own
for
the
first
time
in
decades
the
overhaul
was
designed
to
reverse
a
oil
output
slide
and
has
already
resulted
in
competitive
auctions
that
have
awarded
more
than
exploration
and
production
contracts
to
the
likes
of
royal
dutch
shell
and
exxonmobil
what
s
most
important
is
to
resolve
the
problem
of
falling
crude
oil
production
we
re
extracting
very
little
oil
said
lopez
obrador
during
the
first
five
months
of
this
year
mexican
crude
oil
production
averaged
about
million
bpd
a
dramatic
drop
compared
to
peak
output
of
nearly
million
bpd
in
or
million
bpd
