guaido
said
in
a
speech
on
tuesday
in
reference
to
maduro
s
government
citgo
s
headquarters
have
been
torn
into
factions
by
the
political
battle
pdvsa
last
week
sought
to
remove
citizens
from
its
board
and
huddled
over
a
legal
strategy
to
block
the
expected
appointments
some
venezuelan
executives
have
been
recalled
to
caracas
others
dismissed
and
some
maduro
loyalists
suddenly
reappeared
people
familiar
with
the
company
s
operations
said
washington
also
has
been
closely
involved
in
talks
on
the
fate
of
citgo
which
owns
about
percent
of
oil
refining
capacity
the
unit
runs
refineries
in
illinois
texas
and
louisiana
operates
fuel
pipelines
and
terminals
and
supplies
a
retail
network
of
gas
station
across
states
esser
has
been
making
routine
decisions
as
citgo
s
current
president
asdrubal
chavez
and
his
closest
collaborators
have
run
the
company
from
the
bahamas
where
a
citgo
executive
office
was
opened
last
year
three
people
at
the
firm
said
the
mechanics
of
how
the
new
board
would
take
over
are
unclear
and
there
are
likely
to
be
court
challenges
to
the
board
s
authority
people
familiar
with
the
deliberations
said
a
long
fight
in
courts
could
jeopardize
guaido
s
attempt
to
control
operation
of
citgo
s
refineries
and
gain
access
to
the
millions
of
dollars
of
dividends
citgo
generates
each
year
the
company
has
been
barred
from
paying
dividends
to
pdvsa
and
the
cash
is
believed
to
have
accrued
on
its
books
his
plan
for
citgo
recently
was
revised
to
give
the
proposed
board
a
timeline
to
act
and
specific
directions
while
offering
candidates
protection
from
liability
over
allegations
linked
to
pdvsa
some
of
which
are
under
investigation
by
authorities
