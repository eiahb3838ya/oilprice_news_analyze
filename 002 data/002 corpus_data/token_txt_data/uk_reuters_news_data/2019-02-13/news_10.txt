seeks
to
replace
deliveries
to
the
united
states
and
europe
that
were
disrupted
by

restrictions
the
south
american
nation
is
turning
its
focus
to
buyers
especially
in
india
its
customer
after
the
united
states
amid
sanctions
designed
to
undercut
financial
support
for
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
sanctions
are
designed
to
bar
maduro
s
access
to
oil
revenue
that
has
helped
his
government
remain
in
power
in
the
two
weeks
since
the
sanctions
were
announced
pdvsa
has
been
able
to
load
and
export
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
and
refined
products
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
data
venezuela
was
exporting
about
million
bpd
in
the
months
before
sanctions
according
to
the
eikon
data
two
supertankers

fuel
towards
asia
although
the
final
destinations
of
these
vessels
were
not
yet
clear
but
finding
customers
in
asia
may
be
difficult
analysts
said
as
washington
uses
its
political
and
financial
clout
to
pressure
countries
to
stay
clear
of
dealing
with
pdvsa
barclays
bank
addressed
the
issue
in
a
special
report
on
venezuela
issued
on
tuesday
considering
all
the
difficulties
that
venezuela
faces
in
delivering
oil
to
other
markets
and
the
legal
reputational
and
financial
risks
confronting
traders
or
counterparties
that
do
business
with
it
under
the
current
conditions
the
bank
wrote
it
seems
unlikely
that
all
production
can
in
short
order
go
to
other
before
the
sanctions
pdvsa
shipped
over
bpd
to
the
united
states
its
largest
cash
market
followed
by
india

quevedo
said
on
monday
in
new

we
want
to
double
that
reliance
is
among
pdvsa
s
main
customers
while
nayara
receives
venezuelan
oil
from
one
of
its
largest
stakeholders
russian
rosneft
the
latter
supplies
pdvsa
oil
to
vadinar
india
s
second
largest
refinery
under
a
rosneft

for

program
that
dates
to
rosneft
should
be
able
to
continue
to
receive
pdvsa
cargoes
under
its
according
to
a
reading
of
sanctions
by
lawyers
and
traders
nayara
receives
around
half
of
venezuelan
crude
supplied
to
rosneft
with
the
remainder
shipped
to
europe
including
rosneft
operations
in

around
million

its

indian
refineries
could
absorb
a
large
portion
of
those
barrels
but
it
is
still
unclear
how
cash
sales
would
be
effected
without
using
the
or
european
bank
systems
after
april
the
deadline
set
by

venezuela
also
is
open
to
barter
arrangements
with
india
using
oil
as
payment
its
oil
minister
said
though
quevedo
did
not
explain
how
such
a
system
would
work
quevedo
s
willingness
to
barter
goods
for
oil
suggests
the
turn
may
not
soon
resolve
the
country
s
need
for
customers
to
replace
buyers
about
million
barrels
were
stuck
last
