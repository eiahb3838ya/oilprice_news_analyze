british
columbia
on
thursday
edged
back
from
its
pledge
to
block
increased
shipments
of
crude
oil
through
the
pacific
coast
province
saying
it
is
now
pursuing
legal
advice
on
whether
it
has
jurisdiction
to
impose
the
temporary
ban
the
province
sparked
a
trade
war
with
neighbouring
alberta
last
month
when
it
announced
numerous
new
environmental
rules
including
plans
to
bar
any
increase
in
heavy
oil
shipments
while
a
panel
studied
the
impact
of
heavy
oil
spills
we
believe
it
is
our
right
to
take
appropriate
measures
to
protect
our
environment
economy
and
our
coast
from
the
drastic
consequence
of
a
diluted
bitumen
spill
said
british
columbia
premier
john
horgan
in
a
statement
and
we
are
prepared
to
confirm
that
right
in
the
the
proposed
rules
were
seen
as
a
direct
attack
on
kinder
morgan
canada
s
c
billion
billion
trans
mountain
pipeline
expansion
which
would
nearly
triple
capacity
on
an
existing
pipeline
from
alberta
s
energy
heartland
to
a
metro
vancouver
port
in
response
alberta
s
premier
rachel
notley
imposed
a
ban
on
the
sale
british
columbia
wine
and
called
on
the
federal
government
to
step
in
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
over
the
project
the
trans
mountain
expansion
was
approved
by
canada
in
but
has
been
repeatedly
delayed
by
permitting
issues
horgan
said
his
government
is
retaining
legal
counsel
to
pursue
the
jurisdictional
issues
in
court
but
that
the
process
could
take
several
weeks
in
the
meantime
the
province
will
proceed
with
the
other
measures
around
oil
spill
preparedness
response
and
compensation
