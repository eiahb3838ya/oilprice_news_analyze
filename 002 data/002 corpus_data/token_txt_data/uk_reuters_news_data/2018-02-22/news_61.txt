world
stocks
tumbled
to
lows
on
thursday
after
the
fed
confirmed
it
was
on
track
to
raise
interest
rates
several
times
this
year
sending
bond
yields
to
new
highs
while
yields
retreated
after
nearing
the
psychologically
key
percent
level
the
minutes
of
the
federal
reserve
s
meeting
at
the
end
of
january
has
at
least
temporarily
taken
the
edge
off
investors
appetite
for
equities
and
other
assets
perceived
as
risky
such
as
emerging
markets
and
commodities
with
fed
policymakers
agreeing
that
a
gradual
upward
trajectory
of
the
federal
funds
rate
would
be
appropriate
the
odds
in
the
market
of
faster
interest
rate
hikes
have
narrowed
and
a
host
of
fed
fund
futures
have
hit
contract
lows
the
dollar
too
was
trading
just
off
highs
against
a
basket
of
currencies
and
was
set
for
its
first
week
of
gains
this
year
three
rate
rises
are
now
almost
fully
priced
in
for
compared
with
two
as
recently
as
december
and
some
traders
are
even
contemplating
the
possibility
of
four

thomsen
global
head
of

research
at
indosuez
wealth
management
in
geneva
said
markets
seemed
to
have
finally
accepted
a
faster
rate
rise
trajectory
for
but
she
saw
no
reason
for
an
equity
market
collapse
or
sharp

selloff
when
i
look
at
the
fundamentals
i
see
stable
growth
in
all
major
economies
good
earnings
from
the
majority
of
companies
and
in
a
historical
context
i
see
low
interest

and
low

owens
thomsen
said
she
was
referring
to
percent
of
s
p
firms
which
have
beaten
analysts
forecasts
with
their
results
while
in
europe
the
number
stands
at

than

all
the

saw
steep
losses
on
wednesday
after
the
fed
minutes
and
asian

european

lost
ground
too

the

failed
to
even

from

new

down
around

analysts
noted
that
the
january
fed
meeting
had
happened
after
lawmakers
approved
a
trillion
package
of
tax
cuts
potentially
adding
more
fuel
to
an
economy
which
has
already
picked
up
steam
the
percent
level
on
yields
is
seen
as
a
huge
psychological
milestone
for
bulls
and
bears
alike
in
the
meantime
though
the
yield
which
hit
highs
around
percent
after
the
minutes
retreated
to
percent
yields
touched
new
peaks
that
weighed
on
euro
zone
yields
with
the
german
benchmark
down
one
basis
point
yields
were
also
dampened
by
data
showing
german
business
confidence
fell
more
than
expected
in
february
though
europe
s
biggest
economy
is
clearly
set
for
solid
growth
the
next
hurdle
for
markets
will
be
minutes
from
the
european
central
bank
s
last
meeting
at
gmt
with
investors
keen
to
see
if
there
was
more
talk
of
an
eventual
unwinding
of
stimulus
the
transatlantic
spread
between
german
and
borrowing
costs
widened
to
near
a
year
high
at
bps
reflecting
the
diverging
monetary
policy
expectations
between
the
two
countries
britain
however
confirmed
itself
as
one
of
the
weak
spots
in
the
world
economy
with
data
showing
percent
growth
in
the
last
quarter
of

pushed
sterling
percent
lower
against
