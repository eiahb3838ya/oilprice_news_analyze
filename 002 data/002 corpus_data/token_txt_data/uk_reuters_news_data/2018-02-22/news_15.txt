coral reefs at risk of dissolving as oceans get more acidic-study

coral
reefs
could
start
to
dissolve
before
as
climate
change
drives
acidification
of
the
oceans
scientists
said
on
thursday
acidification
will
threaten
sediments
that
are
building
blocks
for
reefs
corals
already
face
risks
from
ocean
temperatures
pollution
and
overfishing
coral
reefs
will
transition
to
net
dissolving
before
end
of
century
the
team
of
scientists
wrote
in
the
journal
science
net
dissolving
means
reefs
would
lose
more
material
than
they
gain
from
the
growth
of
corals
carbon
dioxide
the
main
greenhouse
gas
forms
a
weak
acid
in
water
and
threatens
to
dissolve
the
reef
sediments
made
from
broken
down
bits
of
corals
and
other
carbonate
organisms
that
accumulate
over
thousands
of
years
it
said
the
sediments
are
times
more
vulnerable
to
acidification
than
the
tiny
coral
animals
that
also
extract
chemicals
directly
from
the
sea
water
to
build
stony
skeletons
that
form
reefs
the
study
said
coral
animals
will
be
able
to
keep
growing
and
replenish
reefs
long
after
sandy
sediments
start
to
dissolve
lead
author
bradley
eyre
of
southern
cross
university
told
reuters
this
probably
reflects
the
corals
ability
to
modify
their
environment
and
partially
adapt
to
ocean
acidification
whereas
the
dissolution
of
sands
is
a
process
that
can
not
adapt
he
wrote
in
an
the
report
said
it
was
unknown
if
the
whole
reef
will
erode
once
the
sediments
become
net
dissolving
and
whether
reefs
will
experience
catastrophic
destruction
or
merely
a
slow
erosion
some
reef
sediments
were
already
starting
to
dissolve
such
as
at
kaneohe
bay
in
hawaii
where
other
pollutants
were
contributing
eyre
said
it
was
unclear
if
the
dissolution
of
sediments
could
be
a
threat
to
entire
islands
from
the
pacific
to
the
caribbean
other
studies
say
that
deep
cuts
in
greenhouse
gas
emissions
can
limit
acidification
most
studies
show
that
acidification
will
be
overwhelmingly
bad
for
ocean
life
also
threatening
creatures
such
as
oysters
lobsters
and
crabs
another
study
on
thursday
however
found
that
it
might
help
the
growth
of
some
plants
an
increase
of
carbon
dioxide
in
the
ocean
theoretically
could
stimulate
higher
growth
of
kelp
and
seaweeds
