the
retreat
came
after
minutes
of
the
federal

s
last
policy
meeting
showed
the
usual
concerns
that
inflation
might
disappoint
but
also
an
expectation
of
faster
economic
growth
due

fiscal
stimulus
in
particular
members
agreed
that
the
strengthening
in
the
economic
outlook
increased
the
likelihood
that
a
gradual
upward
trajectory
of
the
federal
funds
rate
would
be
that
led

narrow
the

noted
barclays

michael
gapen
since
then
more

has
arrived
and
there
is
some
tentative
though
not
conclusive
evidence
of
stronger
wage
and
inflation
data
he
added
we
continue
to
expect
four
rate
hikes
in
and
that
risk
was
not
welcome
in
the
treasury
market
where
yields
on
notes
touched
their
highest
in
four
years
and
those
on
paper
the
highest
in
nine
yields
on
debt
were
last
trading
at
percent
and
creeping
ever
closer
to
percent
a
huge
psychological
milestone
for
bulls
and
bears
alike
for
once
the
lift
in
yields
seemed
to
benefit
the
dollar
which
was
up
at

a
basket
of
