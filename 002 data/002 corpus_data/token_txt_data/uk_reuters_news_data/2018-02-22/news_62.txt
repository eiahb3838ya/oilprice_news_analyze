caught
between
logistical
bottlenecks
and
surging
demand
from
power
plants
india
will
likely
increase
coal
imports
in
industry
executives
said
in
what
would
be
a
setback
to
the
government
s
plans
to
cut
the
country
s
dependence
on
foreign
supplies
the
projected
higher
coal
demand
which
would
reverse
two
years
of
declines
will
be
a
boon
for
international
miners
such
as
indonesia
s
adaro
energy
australia
s
whitehaven
coal
or
global
commodity
merchant
glencore
but
the
country
s
power
plants
and
cement
makers
the
source
of
the
resurgent
demand
will
end
up
eating
the
cost
of

grappling
with

according

coal
trader
told
reuters
they
power
plants
are
not
going
to
get

were
promised
because
of
limitations
on
the
infrastructure
side
said
rajendra
singh
adani
s
chief
operating
officer
for
coal
trading
now
either
you
shut
down
or
you
absorb
the
price
of
imports
he
said
the
train
shortage
in
india
has
left
about
power
stations
without
spare
coal
supplies
and
other
plants
with
stockpiles
that
are
less
than
seven
days
of
consumption
the

ending

in

the

is
averaging

the

also
said
that
the

india
needs
a
total

per

to
meet

according
to
the
jan
meeting
minutes
the
stretched
supply
chains
and
higher
costs
for
imports
are
worrying
indian
power
companies
the
question
is
how
far
do
you
stretch
a
rubber
band
today
it
is
pretty
stretched
said
vipul
tuli
chief
executive
officer
of

unit
referring
to
the
rising
costs
of
imported
coal
after

state
last

the

said
last

that
indian
coal
imports
will
rise
in
after
falling
for
two
straight
years
power
generators
are
not
the
only
source
of
additional
coal
demand
cement
makers
are
buying
coal
to
replace
the
petroleum
coke
they
use
to
fuel
furnaces
that
make
cement
from
minerals
in
october
india
banned
the
use
around
the
capital
of
new
delhi
of
petroleum
coke
or
petcoke
a
highly
polluting
fuel
that
is
the
solid
remnants
left
over
from
processing
fuel
oil
into
fuels
at
oil
refineries
while
cement
companies
have
gained
exemptions
from
the
ban
they
are
replacing
some
of
their
petcoke
with
coal
to
avoid
production
delays
petcoke
consumption
by
cement
makers
will
likely
fall
by
percent
to
percent
in
said
kirik
gandhi
an
executive
at
shree
cement
adding
that
they
will
diversify
into
other
fuels
mainly
imported
coal
to
further
reduce
petcoke
consumption
the
country
in
december
raised
the
import
duty
on
the
fuel
to
percent
from
percent
australian
mining
giant
bhp
said
this
week
that
the
duty
increase
which
mostly
impacts
cement
manufacturing
is
expected
to
add
roughly
to
million
tonnes
to
coal
we
are
all
geared
up
for
more
coal
imports
because
this
question
will
come
again
for
sure
