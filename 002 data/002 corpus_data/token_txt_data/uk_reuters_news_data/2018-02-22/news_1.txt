it
would
restart
some
production
at
its
ohio
factory
that
was
stopped
late
last
year
and
hire
new
employees
due
to
robust
demand
for
its
solar
panels
both
in
the
united
states
and
overseas
the
solar
company
which
makes
products
both
overseas
and
in
perrysburg
ohio
had
shut
down
the
lines
to
prepare
to
produce
a
panel
known
as
the

demand
for
the
company
s
existing
series
however
has
proved
to
be
so
strong
that
it
will
restart
two
of
those
production
lines
the
company
will
hire
about
employees
to
run
those
lines
the

forecast
for
the
year
it
said
first
solar
has
benefited
from
having
a
technology
that
is
not
subject
to
the
percent
tariffs
imposed
by
president
donald
trump
on
solar
imports
last
month
its
panels
are
made
from
cadmium
telluride
while
the
tariffs
apply
only
to
traditional
silicon
solar
products
the
company
has
also
enjoyed
increased
demand
for
its
panels
outside
the
united
states
whether
we
continue
to
run
these
lines
beyond
will
depend
on
market
conditions
