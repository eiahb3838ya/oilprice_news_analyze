update 5-german court delays ruling on diesel ban to next week
leipzig
germany
reuters
a
german
court
has
delayed
a
ruling
on
whether
major
cities
can
ban
heavily
polluting
diesel
cars
which
could
hit
the
resale
value
of
up
to
million
vehicles
in
europe
s
largest
car
market
and
force
automakers
to
pay
for
costly
modifications
judge
andreas
korbmacher
said
on
thursday
the
country
s
highest
federal
administrative
court
would
rule
on
on
an
appeal
brought
by
german
states
against
bans
imposed
by
local
courts
in
stuttgart
and
duesseldorf
over
poor
air
quality
we
still
see
a
considerable
need
for
guidance
he
said
before
breaking
off
the
leipzig
court
hearing
responding
to
a
question
on
whether
the
european
court
of
justice
ecj
may
have
to
be
consulted
on
the
matter
the
ecj
was
not
immediately
available
for
comment
european
commission
spokesman
margaritis
schinas
said
on
thursday
the
commission
was
not
in
charge
of
traffic
regulations
in
cities
we
don
t
view
this
as
a
case
when
we
have
community
competence
or
we
have
something
meaningful
to
there
has
been
a
global
backlash
against
cars
since
volkswagen
admitted
in
to
cheating
exhaust
tests
meant
to
limit
emissions
of
particulate
matter
and
nitrogen
oxide
nox
known
to
cause
respiratory
disease
while
other
countries
are
also
considering
restrictions
on
diesel
cars
bans
in
the
birthplace
of
the
modern
automobile
would
be
a
new
blow
for
the
car
industry
and
an
embarrassment
for
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
government
which
has
backed
it
the
leipzig
court
is
due
to
rule
on
whether
bans
imposed
by
local
courts
are
legal
after
environmental
group
duh
sued
city
authorities
the
duh
is
also
seeking
bans
in
other
german
cities
everything
is
still
open
but
we
are
much
more
optimistic
duh
chief
juerger
resch
said
after
thursday
s
proceedings
noting
the
judge
had
made
clear
that
european
pollution
limits
were
and
must
be
complied
with
quickly
we
are
convinced
that
the
court
will
make
its
own
decision
and
we
also
want
a
national
germany
has
long
promoted
diesel
to
help
cut
carbon
dioxide
emissions
and
meet
climate
change
goals
but
the
volkswagen
vw
scandal
has
pushed
its
carmakers
to
step
up
spending
on
electric
cars
as
well
as
investments
into
making
diesel
engines
cleaner
during
proceedings
in
leipzig
on
thursday
lawyers
discussed
whether
the
government
would
have
to
introduce
a
new
way
of
labelling
cars
to
enable
authorities
to
enforce
any
bans
merkel
s
government
which
has
come
under
fire
for
its
close
ties
to
the
car
industry
has
lobbied
against
bans
fearing
they
could
anger
millions
of
drivers
and
disrupt
traffic
in
cities
with
public
transport
not
in
a
position
to
take
up
the
slack
meanwhile
authorities
in
paris
madrid
mexico
city
and
athens
have
said
they
plan
to
ban
diesel
vehicles
from
city
centres
by
while
the
mayor
of
copenhagen
wants
to
ban
new
diesel
cars
from
entering
the
city
as
soon
as
next
year
a
small
group
of
protesters
from
greenpeace
gathered
outside
the
leipzig
court
with
images
of
lungs
painted
on
their
chests
and
holding
up
signs
reading
clean
air
now
because
the
government
has
failed
to
do
anything
for
years
about
exhaust
problems
in
the
cities
judges
have
to
decide
today
how
residents
will
be
protected
from
bad
air
said
greenpeace
transport
spokesman
benjamin
stephan
air
quality
has
been
a
broader
issue
in
the
european
union
leading
to
a
meeting
last
month
between
environment
commissioner
karmenu
vella
and
representatives
of
nine
countries
that
face
legal
action
over
the
problem
including
germany
and
france
a
spokesman
for
the
commission
said
on
thursday
the
countries
had
submitted
additional
information
and
the
commission
would
come
back
to
the
matter
in
the
threat
of
bans
has
prompted
a
big
fall
in
sales
of
diesel
cars
in
germany
down
to
just
a
third
of
new
car
sales
in
january
from
almost
half

the

scandal

its
