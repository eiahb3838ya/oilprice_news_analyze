minutes
of
the
fed
s
meeting
at
the
end
of
january
have
at
least
temporarily
taken
the
edge
off
investors
appetite
for
equities
and
other
assets
perceived
as
risky
such
as
emerging
markets
and
the
minutes
showed
fed
policymakers
agreed
at
the
meeting
held
after
lawmakers
had
approved
some
trillion
in
tax
cuts
that
a
gradual
upward
trajectory
of
the
federal
funds
rate
would
be
appropriate
they
also
noted
upward
risks
to
economic
growth
and
inflation
as
a
result
the
odds
of
faster
interest
rate
hikes
have
narrowed
with
a
host
of
fed

hitting

rises
are
almost
fully

now
reckon

might

possible

some
of

down

the
impact
of
the
fed
s
minutes
was
further
tempered
by
the
latest
minutes
from
the
european
central
bank
which
retained
its
dovish
stance
and
said
even
changes
in
communication
would
be
premature
the
comments
suggest
that

will
move
by
increments
keeping
one
eye
on

avoid

not
react

tempered
by

hurdle
analysts
at

said
if
powell
signalled
the
current
tightening
pace

remain
that

the
