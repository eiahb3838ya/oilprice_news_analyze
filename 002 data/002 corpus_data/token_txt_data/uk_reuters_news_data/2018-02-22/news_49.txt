indian
refiner
essar
oil
is
looking
to
raise
over
billion
million
pounds
from
trading
houses
after
its
new
russian
owners
could
not
raise
loans
from
major
western
banks
due
to
sanctions
on
russia
essar
wants
to
borrow
the
money
for
years
and
repay
it
with
cargoes
of
refined
products
as
it
seeks
to
cut
its
reliance
on
lending
from
indian
banks
banking
and
trading
sources
familiar
with
the
discussions
said
it
would
be
the
first
large
deal
by
essar
which
has
previously
engaged
only
in
deals

major
rosneft
fund
ucp
and
swiss
commodities
trader
trafigura
bought
essar
oil
s
large
refinery
fuel
stations
and
infrastructure
for
billion
last
year
rosneft
has
been
under
sanctions
since
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
in
the
essar
deal
was
funded
mainly
by
russian
state
banks
including
vtb
and
the
new
owners
attempts
to
partially
borrow
from
large
western
banks
have
so
far
not
progressed
banks
are
not
technically
forbidden
from
lending
to
essar
in
which
rosneft
owns
percent
sanctions
forbid
lending
to
entities
by
rosneft
but
banking
sources
have
said
they
would
still
exercise
caution
essar
and
rosneft
initially
signalled
interest
in
borrowing
but
have
gone
silent
in
the
past
six
months
after
most
banks
signalled
to
them
they
would
not
be
able
to
lend
said
a
source
with
a
major
western
bank
which
initially
received
an
invitation
to
express
interest
the
new
shareholders
are
keen
to
diversify
their
financing
base
away
from
relying
only
on
indian
banks
as
had
been
the
case
under
the
ruia
family
who
were
the
former
owners
one
of
the
banking
sources
said
a
spokesman
for
essar
oil
declined
to
comment
previously
essar
oil
india
had
credit
lines
with
indian
banks
which
complicated
the
closing
of
the
deal
using
a
prepayment
was
viewed
as
a
easier
alternative
to
widen
its
cash
base
however
lending
to
essar
is
also
complicated
by
the
types
of
crude
it
is
relying
on
for
its
operations
with
significant
volumes
coming
from
iran
and
venezuela
while
the
international
oil
embargo
on
iran
was
lifted
in
early
restrictions
on

use
in
connection
to
iran
remain
president
donald
trump
has
also
repeatedly
criticised
the
nuclear
pact
with
tehran
and
threatened
to
stop
extending
sanctions
relief
as
for
venezuela
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
said
the
government
has
been
weighing
sanctions
on
the
south
american
country
s
oil
industry
essar
is
expected
to
issue
a
early
in
the
second
quarter
of
this
year
outlining
the
details
of
the
loan
a
second
banking
source
said
traders
who
loan
funds
would
be
repaid
with
gasoline
and
gasoil
cargoes
rosneft
said
last
in
august
last
year
that
essar
oil
planned
to
double
throughput
at
the
refinery
and
build
a
petrochemical
plant
