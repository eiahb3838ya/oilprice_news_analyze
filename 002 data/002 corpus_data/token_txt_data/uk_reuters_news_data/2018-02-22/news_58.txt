if
you
were
looking
for
signs
that
the
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
is
starting
to
spin
a
little
faster
the
announcement
of
a
planned
massive
expansion
in
papua
new
guinea
is
ample
evidence
global
majors
exxon
mobil
and
total
are
considering
plans
to
double
lng
exports
from
papua
new
guinea
to
about
million
tonnes
per
annum
their
partner
oil
search
said
on
if
approved
three
new
trains
would
be
added
to
the
existing
png
lng
facility
with
natural
gas
from
total
s
fields
supplying
two
of
the
units
and
the
third
using
existing
fields
and
a
new
exxon
development
while
a
final
investment
decision
on
the
billion
expansion
is
still
more
than
a
year
away
it
s
a
clear
sign
that
lng
producers
believe
the
market
is
headed
for
a
deficit
and
that
projects
are
once
again
viable
the
lng
industry
s
recent
development
has
been
characterised
by
periods
of
massive
investment
and
capacity
expansions
followed
by
lulls
amid
fears
of
low
prices
caused
by
oversupply
the
past
decade
has
witnessed
a
rapid
expansion
of
lng
capacity
with
eight
projects
being
built
in
australia
and
six
in
the
united
states
as
well
as
some
others
such
as
the
yamal
venture
in
russia
most
of
these
developments
have
started
or
are
due
to
start
within
a
fairly
narrow
time
frame
between
and
a
bunching
together
of
new
capacity
that
led
to
widespread
market
concern
of
oversupply
and
weak
prices
while
it
s
still
likely
that
there
may
be
some
oversupply
this
year
and
perhaps
until
the
early
the
market
reality
is
that
new
lng
buyers
in
asia
and
a
surge
in
chinese
demand
has
eaten
away
most
of
the
expected
surplus
china
imported
million
tonnes
of
lng
in
up
percent
from
the
prior
year
according
to
customs
data
a
few
years
ago
there
were
forecasts
that
china
would
import
as
much
as
million
tonnes
of
lng
a
year
by
the
middle
of
the
next
decade
predictions
that
started
to
look
wildly
optimistic
as
lng
imports
struggled
to
gain
traction
in
the
period
however
a
concerted
effort
by
the
authorities
in
beijing
to
switch
from
coal
to
natural
gas
has
seen
a
surge
in
lng
imports
one
that
is
likely
to
continue
as
cleaning
up
air
pollution
remains
a
priority
making
million
tonnes
per
annum
a
realistic
target
the
attractiveness
of
lng
relative
to
coal
has
also
been
boosted
by
a
declining
spot
price
for
lng
in
asia
which
at
the
current
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
is
less
than
half
the
peak
of
reached
in
february
it
s
not
just
china
turning
to
lng
with
other
asian
countries
including
india
pakistan
vietnam
the
philippines
sri
lanka
and
others
all
planning
to
increase
their
capacity
to
the
fuel
this
new
dynamic
hasn
t
gone
unnoticed
by
lng
companies
which
are
starting
to
ramp
up
talk
and
action
about
new
projects
after
a
quiet
few
years
spent
trying
to
complete
existing
developments
while
navigating
lower
prices
and
buyer
demands
for
more
flexible
contracts
australia
s
woodside
petroleum
operator
of
the
existing
million
tonne
per
annum
northwest
shelf
project
recently
launched
an
almost
billion
capital
raising
in
order
to
buy
control
of
an
offshore
field
from
partner
exxon
and
use
the
natural
gas
for
an
expansion
of
its
pluto
lng
plant
mozambique
s
vast
resources
are
also
getting
closer
to
coming
to
market
with
anadarko
petroleum
announcing
a
sales
agreement
on
bringing
it
closer
to
a
final
investment
decision
however
all
these
potential
projects
are
facing
quite
a
different
market
to
the
last
round
of
that
are
now
coming
on
stream
buyers
especially
the
majors
in
north
asia
such
as
japan
south
korea
and
china
have
made
it
clear
they
want
flexible
contracts
this
means
an
end
to
destination
clauses
an
end
or
at
least
substantial
changes
to
the
method
of
pricing
lng
against
crude
oil
and
considerably
contracts
or
even
more
spot
deliveries
this
makes
it
hard
to
secure
the
agreements
needed
to
secure
funding
for
dollar
projects
meaning
it
s
likely
that
those
companies
with
strong
balance
sheets
that
they
can
leverage
off
will
enjoy
greater
chances
of
success
in
developing
a
new
lng
plant
the
lng
market
is
also
likely
to
become
more
volatile
and
the
seasonal
swings
may
become
more
pronounced
especially
if
china
remains
the
main
driver
of
demand
growth
china
s
lng
demand
is
concentrated
over
the
northern
winter
when
the
fuel
is
used
for
mainly
heating
replacing
boilers
in
both
industry
and
residential
use
while
power
demand
for
does
increase
during
summer
china
has
comparatively
little
generation
meaning
demand
for
coal
and
other
forms
of
electricity
such
as
hydro
and
nuclear
shoulder
the
burden
this
dynamic
is
likely
to
lead
to
sharper
price
spikes
during
winter
and
declines
in
summer
than
has
been
the
case
in
past
years
overall
the
lng
market
is
shifting
from
being
staid
and
focused
on
the
long
term
to
one
characterised
by
rising
volatility
deals
and
increasing
innovation
