india
state
refiners
expect
their
profit
margins
to
hold
their
strength
this
year
as
demand
growth
accelerates
for
fuel
products
amid
a
record
billion
spent
on
infrastructure
and
stable
crude
oil
prices
company
executives
and
analysts
said
india
s
sales
of
cars
and
especially
motorbikes
are
forecast
to
rise
rapidly
even
as
the
development
of
a
industrial
corridor
drives
consumption
of
the
country
s
primary
fuel
products
diesel
and
gasoline
the
infrastructure
programme
for
fiscal
calls
for
more
than
km
miles
in
new
highways
to
better
connect
rural
areas
with
urban
hubs
roads
and
other
construction
require
products
such
as
tar
and
plastic
piping
and
fuel
to
move
materials
by
truck
and
rail
they
these
projects
will
have
a
cascading
effect
on
fuel
demand
said
ramachandran
director
of
refineries
at
bharat
petroleum
adding
that
this
would
be
reflected
directly
in
strong
refining
margins
india
s
annual
fuel
demand
made
up
mainly
of
diesel
and
gasoline
is
expected
to
grow
percent
in
according
to
a
report
by
bmi
research
a
unit
of
fitch
that
compares
with
percent
last
year
according
to
government
data
strong
fundamentals
and
rising
demand
in
india
indicate
that
refining
margins
will
remain
strong
in
the
near
term
for
at
least
six
months
ramachandran
said
refining
margins
also
rely
heavily
on
global
crude
oil
prices
currently
around
a
barrel
and
on
the
status
of
world
inventories
of
refined
products
indian
refiners
hope
global
prices
will
remain
per
barrel
as
world
oil
production
rises
while
new
refining
capacity
doesn
t
keep
the
pace
the
international
energy
agency
said
this
month
it
expects
oil
production
to
slightly
outpace
demand
this
year
especially
thanks
to
still
rising
output
in
the
united
states
surana
head
of
hindustan
petroleum
corp
said
he
expected
international
crude
prices
between
and
a
barrel
this
year
as
long
as
there
are
no
geopolitical
crises
or
technical
disturbances
like
damage
to
the
forties
pipeline
based
on
that
expectation
india
s
refiners
should
see
refining
margins
also
known
as
cracks
in
the
range
of
per
barrel
for
all
three
refiners
products
demand
continues
to
rally
on
better
industrial
performance
and
support
rising
oil
prices
have
done
little
to
dampen
the
growth
so
far
said
sri
paravaikkarasu
head
of
east
of
suez
oil
at
consultancy
fge
fge
expects
singapore
margins
to
hold
around
a
barrels
due
to
upcoming
refinery
maintenance
and
summer
demand
the
margins
for
indian
refiners
will
be
slightly
better
as
india
prices
its
products
on
import
parity
basis
she
said
asia
s
benchmark
margins
in
the
oil
trading
hub
of
singapore
currently
stand
around
per
barrel
better
refining
margins
for
the
refiners
and
improved
profit
from
selling
retail
fuel
will
pump
more
cash
into
government
coffers
ahead
of
key
elections
this
year
and
next
for
prime
minister
narendra
modi
who
needs
money
for
his
ambitious
healthcare
and
infrastructure
programmes
the
cash
inflow
would
come
just
ahead
of
eight
state
elections
this
year
and
national
elections
in
healthy
profits
will
also
help
the
refiners
to
continue
spending
on
expansion
plans
india
aims
to
increase
its
refining
capacity
by
percent
to
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
by
which
will
cost
dozens
of
billions
of
dollars
refiners
indian
oil
corp
ltd
hindustan
petroleum
corp
and
bharat
petroleum
corp
that
sell
most
of
their
output
locally
at
prices
linked
to
global
rates
largely
reported
strong
profits
and
margins
for
the
quarter
while
indian
gasoline
and
diesel
prices
are
linked
to
global
rates
during
state
or
central
elections
private
rivals
say
firms
often
do
not
increase
retail
selling
rates
a
risk
to
margins
analysts
point
out
only
if
crude
prices
suddenly
spike
we
expect
margins
to
improve
cracks
appear
to
be
good
