a
german
court
might
not
reach
a
decision
on
thursday
after
all
on
whether
major
cities
can
ban
heavily
polluting
diesel
cars
a
ruling
being
closely
watched
by
automakers
and
drivers
of
million
vehicles
in
europe
s
largest
car
market
judge
andreas
korbmacher
told
the
court
he
was
not
sure
whether
the
country
s
highest
federal
administrative
court
would
rule
on
thursday
after
german
states
had
appealed
against
bans
imposed
by
local
courts
in
stuttgart
and
duesseldorf
korbmacher
suggested
that
the
european
court
of
justice
might
have
to
consider
the
issue
of
whether
driving
bans
are
permissible
despite
the
lack
of
a
national
enabling
framework
there
has
been
a
global
backlash
against
cars
since
volkswagen
admitted
in
to
cheating
exhaust
tests
meant
to
limit
emissions
of
particulate
matter
and
nitrogen
oxide
nox
known
to
cause
respiratory
disease
