ottawa
reuters
boeing
co
may
take
part
in
a
race
to
supply
canada
with
new
fighter
jets
and
stands
an
equal
chance
with
other
bidders
even
though
it
is
locked
in
a
trade
dispute
with
ottawa
a
senior
canadian
official
said
on
thursday
procurement
minister
carla
qualtrough
made
her
comments
shortly
after
the
liberal
government
released
a
list
of
five
companies
that
would
be
allowed
to
compete
boeing
along
with
rival
lockheed
martin
corp
is
on
the
list
of
approved
suppliers
canada
is
due
to
release
the
exact
specifications
for
the
jets
next
year
officials
say
the
deal
is
worth
between
c
billion
billion
and
c
billion
although
boeing
angered
canada
last
year
by
launching
a
trade
challenge
against
planemaker
bombardier
inc
qualtrough
said
the
dispute
would
not
necessarily
harm
boeing
if
it
chose
to
enter
its
super
hornet
all
the
five
teams
on
the
supplier
list
have
an
equal
chance
she
said
in
a
phone
interview
when
asked
about
boeing
s
prospects
given
the
bombardier
row
none
of
the
contenders
are
obliged
to
take
part
boeing
spokesman
scott
day
said
the
aerospace
giant
would
continue
to
evaluate
its
participation
in
the
competition
a
trade
commission
last
month
dismissed
boeing
s
complaint
that
bombardier
was
dumping
planes
on
the
american
market
at
absurdly
low
prices
canadian
officials
have
privately
made
it
clear
that
boeing
needs
to
drop
the
matter
to
stand
a
better
chance
of
winning
the
fighter
jet
contract
say
sources
ottawa
has
made
clear
that
bids
will
be
evaluated
in
part
by
whether
firms
have
caused
any
past
economic
damage
to
canada
a
clear
reference
to
boeing
but
on
thursday
qualtrough
said
we
haven
t
decided
how
far
back
into
the
past
companies
actions
will
be
canada
is
remaining
in
the
consortium
that
helped
fund
development
of
the
which
has
prompted
some
defense
analysts
to
suggest
the
jet
has
an
advantage
going
into
the
competition
we
re
aware
of
that
perception
and
we
are
working
very
hard
to
make
sure
that
the
process
is
fair
and
transparent
said
qualtrough
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
initially
opposed
the
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
too
costly
but
ottawa
has
since
softened
its
line
the
government
said
the
other
companies
eligible
to
take
part
are
airbus
which
makes
the
eurofighter
saab
ab
which
makes
the
gripen
and
dassault
aviation
which
makes
the
rafale
canadian
dollars
