german
solar
battery
maker
sonnen
is
giving
away
electric
car
plugs
to
new
household
customers
seeking
to
attract
drivers
frustrated
by
the
slow
of
shared
charging
points
and
link
them
up
to
better
manage
power
demand
the
venture
unveiled
its
kilowatt
sonnencharger
on
thursday
for
ordering
by
members
of
its
online
energy
sharing
platform
in
germany
with
first
deliveries
expected
by
the
end
of
june
philipp
schroeder
one
of
its
managing
directors
told
reuters
the
company
hoped
to
create
a
network
of
electric
vehicle
ev
owners
to
help
manage
the
charging
process
and
minimise
disruption
for
power
grids
automotive
and
power
network
companies
will
have
to
solve
these
problems
anyway
and
we
are
hoping
for
partners
he
said
there
will
have
to
be
solutions
for
mass
charging
otherwise
the
move
to
evs
will
not
work
he
added
worldwide
sonnen
has
sold
batteries
for
storing
solar
power
mostly
to
rooftop
solar
panel
owners
its
customers
have
the
capacity
to
generate
a
combined
megawatts
of
solar
power
in
its
core
german
market
some
to
percent
of
customers
are
signed
up
to
the
sonnencommunity
which
shares
power
production
consumption
and
storage
via
data
apps
customers
that
opt
for
a
flat
tariff
get
a
guaranteed
kilowatt
hours
kwh
of
power
per
year
more
than
enough
for
a
typical
four
person
household
which
uses
around
kwh
per
year
that
potentially
leaves
them
with
around
kwh
to
charge
an
ev
equating
to
a
driving
range
of
km
with
the
ev
plug
customers
can
choose
between
slow
and
fast
charging
and
adjust
the
required
volume
helping
to
reduce
the
potential
run
on
power
during
peak
loading
times
that
developers
of
ev
infrastructure
say
could
be
a
problem
sonnen
also
aims
to
market
unused
electricity
from
community
members
panels
to
the
national
power
grid
to
help
stabilise
supply
and
to
market
their
battery
capacity
to
absorb
wind
power
whenever
grids
are
unable
to
transport
it
to
consumers
access
to
car
batteries
would
give
us
additional
storage
capacity
schroeder
said
adding
this
would
cut
down
on
the
amount
of
wind
power
currently
left
unused
at
times
of
grid
bottlenecks
sonnen
which
sells
to
foreign
markets
including
italy
the
united
states
and
australia
saw
a
