frankfurt
feb
reuters
german
trade
union
ig
bce
is
urging
workers
at
three
nuclear
sites
run
by
utility
group
to
down
tools
on
in
a
pay
dispute
a
day
before
the
next
scheduled
talks
with
management
the
northern
german
grohnde
reactor
is
the
site
chosen
for
the
protest
action
while
staff
from
the
unterweser
and
stade
plants
in
the
same
region
were
invited
to
travel
to
grohnde
a
spokesman
for
ig
bce
in
hanover
said
while
grohnde
is
due
to
undergo
maintenance
from
the
weekend
unterweser
and
stade
are
already
idle
under
germany
s
exit
from
nuclear
power
but
must
be
maintained
for
safety
reasons
ahead
of
a
long
decommissioning
process
safety
cover
is
of
course
arranged
but
we
reckon
with
wider
support
for
our
action
to
underscore
our
demands
the
spokesman
said
the
news
comes
in
the
context
of
planned
strikes
in
the
french
electricity
sector
in
coming
days
that
could
cut
production
adding
to
tightness
in
the
interconnected
european
wholesale
power
market
while
the
german
action
s
impact
on
output
will
likely
be
small
it
comes
at
a
time
when
traders
are
nervous
about
this
coinciding
with
rising
power
demand
french
power
is
off
wednesday
s
high
but
still
at
its
highest
level
since
early
december
ig
bce
is
seeking
a
percent
pay
rise
for
nuclear
employees
in
s
preussenelektra
unit
and
those
in
regional
subsidiary
avacon
as
well
as
at
power
network
operator
tennet
workers
already
protested
at
avacon
in
salzgitter
on
monday
the
union
said
employers
had
offered
to
raise
salaries
by
percent
over
months
ig
bce
together
with
the
verdi
union
which
shares
representation
of
some
workers
across
say
the
company
s
offer
left
employees
short
in
comparison
with
related
industries
and
given
s
economic
situation
the
company
has
said
it
will
help
generate
a
fair
deal
