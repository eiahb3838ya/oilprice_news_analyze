venezuela
is
preparing
a
new
cryptocurrency
called
petro
gold
that
will
be
backed
by
precious
metals
president
nicolas
maduro
said
on
wednesday
a
day
after
launching
an
token
that
has
been
panned
as
a
pipe
dream
by
blockchain
experts
maduro
is
hoping
cryptocurrencies
will
help
venezuela
skirt
financial
sanctions
as
it
struggles
under
hyperinflation
and
a
collapsing
socialist
economy
on
tuesday
he
said
the
newly
launched
petro
cryptocurrency
raised
million
in
the
first
day
of
a
opposition
leaders
call
the
cryptocurrency
an
illegal
debt
issue
and
investors
have
questioned
its
value
given
concerns
about
venezuela
s
solvency
and
transparency
next
week
i
m
going
to
launch
the
petro
gold
backed
by
gold
which
is
even
more
powerful
that
will
strengthen
the
petro
maduro
said
in
a
televised
speech
it
was
not
immediately
evident
if
he
was
referring
to
gold
reserves
in
the
central
bank
or
to
undeveloped
mineral
deposits
he
did
not
offer
further
details
the
information
ministry
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
cryptocurrencies
already
exist
including
one
called
rmg
created
by
the
royal
mint
in
britain
but
blockchain
experts
have
broadly
panned
venezuela
s
cryptocurrency
efforts
noting
that
digital
tokens
are
only
as
valuable
as
the
faith
inspired
by
their
issuer
the
country
s
history
of
uncompensated
expropriations
and
the
percent
depreciation
of
its
fiat
currency
the
bolivar
have
created
doubts
about
the
ruling
socialist
party
s
capacity
to
manage
digital
tokens
blockchain
technology
is
built
on
making
information
about
transactions
open
to
the
public
but
the
socialist
party
jealously
guards
even
the
most
basic
of
information
including
about
inflation
the
treasury
department
has
already
warned
that
venezuelan
cryptocurrencies
could
violate
sanctions
and
thus
create
legal
risk
for
investors
sean
walsh
founder
of
investment
firm
redwood
city
ventures
said
it
was
difficult
to
reach
conclusions
about
the
petro
gold
without
seeing
specific
details
but
he
said
he
had
little
interest
in
tokens
backed
by
physical
assets
rather
than
buying
a
cryptocurrency
backed
by
gold
i
d
just
go
buy
the
gold
said
walsh
in
a
telephone
interview
gold
is
a
physical
thing
that
you
want
to
be
able
to
hold
in
your
hands
because
