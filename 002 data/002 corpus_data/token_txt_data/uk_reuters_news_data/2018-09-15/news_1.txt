kenyan
islanders
have
built
a
boat
made
entirely
of
recycled
plastic
collected
during
of
the
ocean
to
highlight
the
growing
menace
of
plastic
waste
that
ends
up
in
the
sea
last
year
the
kenyan
government
imposed
the
world
s
toughest
law
against
plastic
bags
with
offenders
including
producers
retailers
and
ordinary
kenyans
risking
imprisonment
for
up
to
four
years
or
fines
of
in
a
bid
to
reduce
plastic
pollution
many
bags
drift
into
the
ocean
strangling
turtles
suffocating
seabirds
and
filling
the
stomachs
of
dolphins
and
whales
the
construction
of
the
boat
has
been
dubbed
the
flipflopi
project
because
of
the
hundreds
of
recycled
plastic
sandals
that
cover
the
vessel
the
sailing
dhow
which
the
team
built
from
over
tonnes
of
plastic
waste
sailed
for
the
first
time
in
the
waters
off
kenya
s
lamu
island
on
saturday
its
launch
coincided
with
international
world
cleanup
day
during
which
environmental
groups
carry
out
activities
to
tackle
pollution
the
boat
is
a
riot
of
colour
including
red
green
blue
and
yellow
due
to
the
flip
flops
used
to
cover
the
hull
and
other
parts
we
hope
people
around
the
globe
are
inspired
by
our
beautiful
multicoloured
boat
and
find
their
own
ways
to
plastics
said
ben
morrison
the
founder
of
the
flipflopi
project
morrison
who
spent
a
decade
building
a
travel
business
focussed
on
africa
turned
to
constructing
colourful
boats
in
when
he
noticed
alarming
pollution
along
the
kenyan
coast
the
team
used
kenyan
facilities
and
technologies
to
recycle
the
plastic
waste
and
was
led
by
local
boat
builder
ali
abdalla
skanda
we
are
proud
to
be
a
guide
to
the
world
and
its
inhabitants
during
this
vital
time
of
challenge
for
our
ocean
environment

had
received
support
from
around
the
world
as
they
built
the
boat
najib
balala
the
kenyan
tourism
minister
praised
the
team
when
he
attended
the
launch
at
lamu
island
a
protected
world
heritage
site
popular
with
local
and
foreign
holidaymakers
on
kenya
s
far
north
coastline
tourism
is
one
of
the
top
hard
currency
earners
for
kenya
