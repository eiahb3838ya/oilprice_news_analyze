tropical
storm
florence
could
taint
north
carolina
waterways
with
murky
coal
ash
and
toxic
hog
waste
as
heavy
rains
test
environmental
rules
written
with
milder
weather
in
mind
carrying
the
risk
of
contaminating
water
with
bacteria
like
salmonella
officials
said
on
friday
many
of
the
state
s
environmental
codes
were
written
to
withstand
a
or
storm
but
florence
promises
heavy
rains
that
some
regions
might
not
see
in
a
thousand
years
straining
systems
meant
to
keep
state
residents
safe
the
deluge
could
push
industrial
waste
sites
to
the
limit
governor
roy
cooper
said
on
friday
all
of
the
infrastructure
here
is
going
to
be
tested
cooper
told
a
news
conference
we
are
deeply
concerned
about
the
inland
florence
would
not
be
the
first
test
of
north
carolina
manure
pits
or
sixteen
lagoons
flooded
under
the
foot
of
rain
that
came
with
hurricane
matthew
in
the
southeast
part
of
the
state
is
expected
to
get
more
than
twice
that
amount
in
the
days
ahead
said

a
meteorologist
at
dtn
marine
weather
a
forecasting
service
there
are
industrial
hog
farms
within
north
carolina
s
floodplain
environmentalists
estimate
and
duke
energy
corp
has
four
coal
ash
sites
in
the
coastal
area
touched
by
florence
if
excrement
escapes
from
the
lagoons
where
it
is
stored
it
could
potentially
contaminate
drinking
water
with
bacteria
like
salmonella
which
can
cause
digestive
problems
and
in
certain
vulnerable
patients
cause
coli
the
environmental
protection
agency
is
working
with
states
and
is
ready
to
respond
to
any
breaches
a
spokeswoman
maggie
sauerhage
said
animal
feeding
operations
above
a
certain
size
need
to
be
designed
and
operated
to
handle
the
rainfall
and
runoff
from
storms
sauerhage
said
in
an
emailed
response
to
questions
from
reuters
even
in
the
midst
of
a
storm
these
feeding
sites
must
report
leaks
she
said
in
north
carolina
hog
and
poultry
waste
pits
make
up
acres
of
land
according
to
a
report
from
the
environmental
working
group
still
north
carolina
has
fewer
hog
farms
than
it
did
when
hurricane
floyd
inundated
about
sites
in
and
sparked
statewide
reforms
ash
pits
and
other
embankments
have
ruptured
under
heavy
rain
in
the
past
and
duke
energy
has
agreed
to
secure
the
sites
in
north
carolina
s
lowland
areas
but
that
work
is
ongoing
erin
culbert
a
spokeswoman
for
duke
energy
said
the
utility
was
ready
to
respond
as
needed
to
the
storm
there
is
however
disagreement
over
the
risk
posed
by
florence
andy
curliss
head
of
the
north
carolina
pork
council
said
spill
dangers
are
overblown
noting
that
hog
farmers
have
faced
severe
weather
before
this
is
not
the
first
hurricane
to
hit
north
carolina
said
curliss
who
noted
that
many
lagoons
are
at
a
low
point
across
the
state
at
this
time
of
year
but
a
state
lawmaker
said
that
hurricanes
have
led
to
dangerous
spills
in
recent
years
and
north
carolina
s
laws
are
too
lax
to
confront
severe
storms
such
as
florence
as
a
state
we
have
put
our
head
in
the
sand
representative
pricey
harrison
said
past

should
have
been

wakeup
