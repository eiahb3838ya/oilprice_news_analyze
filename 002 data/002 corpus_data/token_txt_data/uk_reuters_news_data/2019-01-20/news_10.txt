programme
to
fund

a
measure

qatar
hopes
the

will
ease
conditions
and
restore

part
of
efforts
to
bolster
its

amid
a
diplomatic
dispute
with
saudi

and
other
gulf
neighbours
speaking
from
his
office
in
doha
mohammed
head
of
qatar
s
gaza
strip
reconstruction
committee
said
the
latest
million
wage
payment
was
initially
withheld
by
israel
but
would
now
arrive
on
wednesday
due
to
the
violence
on
the
border
the
israeli
government
postponed
it
the
agreement
is
subject
to
there
not
being
too
much
violence
so
last
friday
they
israel
approved
to
do
the
third
tranche
emadi
told
reuters
gaza
s
health
ministry
has
said
more
than
palestinians
have
been
killed
by
israeli
troops
since
march
at
border
protests
demanding
an
end
to
an
blockade
of
the
coastal
strip
emadi
said
wage
payments
would
not
be
physically
carried
by
him
in
cash
into
gaza
as
with
previous
disbursements
but
that
a
new
system
had
been
arranged
he
declined
to
specify
how
it
would
work
cogat
the
israeli
government
agency
coordinating
the
gaza
aid
declined
to
comment
emadi
said
qatar
would
next
push
for
a
roughly
million
electricity
project
that
would
have
it
effectively
manage
the
strip
s
power
supply
buying
israeli
electricity
in
bulk
and
distributing
it
across
gaza
while
collecting
payment
from
palestinians
in
return
we
will
fund
this
project
but
i
want
to
make
sure
i
have
control
of
the
electricity
so
i
can
get
my
money
back
he
said
of
the
plan
which
would
see
qatar
build
a
power
substation
and
network
to
end
the
need
for
costly
fuel
shipments
we
need
to
find
a
solution
for
these
million
people
this
is
our
aim
and
goal
not
just
to
deliver
money
because
israel
wants
quiet
or
hamas
wants
