australia's solar, wind boom to power past grid woes in 2019
melbourne

australia
s
wind
and
solar
boom
looks
set
to
power
through
following
a
record
year
despite
grid
constraints
and
extra
scrutiny
from
network
operators
to
make
sure
new
projects
don
t
spark
blackouts
like
ones
that
hit
two
years
ago
abundant
wind
and
sun
falling
turbine
and
panel
costs
and
corporate
demand
for
contracts
to
hedge
against
rising
power
tariffs
have
attracted
dozens
of
international
developers
looking
to
build
wind
and
solar
farms
down
under
even
though
the
developers
have
met
with
on
energy
policy
a
strained
grid
that
has
trouble
integrating
intermittent
renewable
power
and
unexpected
costs
they
still
see
australia
as
a
growth
market
we
believe
that
we
have
a
great
future
in
australia
because
we
have
the
right
answers
said
xavier
barbaro
chief
executive
of
france
s
neoen
whose
biggest
market
is
australia
companies
like
neoen
its
compatriot
india
s
adani
utility
aes
corp
and
germany
s
sonnen
are
expanding
in
australia
looking
to
fill
a
gap
as
ageing
plants
are
retired
over
the
next
two
decades
confidence
is
high
as
the
industry
enters
with
unprecedented
levels
of
construction
activity
under
way
said
anna
freeman
a
director
at
the
clean
energy
council
an
industry
group
australia
generates
nearly
percent
of
its
electricity
from
renewables
this
is
forecast
to
jump
to
percent
over
the
next
years
a
total
of
gigawatts
gw
of
solar
and
wind
projects
worth
a
billion
billion
were
under
construction
or
reached
financial
close
last
year
more
than
double

the

renewable
power
this
rush
of
projects
with
no
clear
guidance
on
where
they
best
fit
led
to
an
element
of
anarchy
but
that
is
changing
said
simon
currie
founder
of
advisory
firm
energy
estate
the
australian
energy
market
operator
aemo
the
energy
council
and
network
companies
are
working
out
clear
guidelines
on
where
to
build
plants
and
how
to
connect
them
to
the
grid
we
re
moving
from
what
was
an
approach
into
something
that
will
be
much
more
planned
said
currie
whose
company
wants
to
develop
australia
s
biggest
renewable
energy
hub
with
gw
of
wind
solar
and
pumped
hydro
capacity
in
new
south
wales
renewable
projects
added
to
the
grid
have
grown
from
with
gw
of
capacity
in
to
a
record
projects
with
gw
added
in
aemo
said
there
are
more
applications
representing
gw
pending
indicating
plenty
of
potential
congestion
ahead
the
biggest
challenge
is
that
developers
are
all
vying
to
connect
to
a
grid
running
km
miles
from
queensland
in
the
north
to
south
australia
and
tasmania
see
graphic
this
grid
was
designed
to
deliver
power
mainly
from
plants
near
three
big
mining
areas
while
wind
and
solar
farms
generate
intermittent
power
from
more
remote
sites
where
network
capacity
can
be
limited
to
keep
the
grid
stable
equipment
such
as
synchronous
condensers
or
batteries
need
to
be
added
which
can
increase
costs
by
at
least
million
for
a
condenser
alone
batteries
could
be
much
higher
developers
who
failed
to
account
for
these
issues
have
run
into
delays
on
project
approvals
or
grid
bringing
unanticipated
costs
which
in
one
case
led
to
the
collapse
of

a

found
grid

is
the
biggest

said
solar
investor
octopus
investments
said
grid
issues
were
what
took
it
two
years
to
choose
its
first
investment
in
australia
the

is
about
to
begin
construction

will
be

country
s
largest
the
grid
is
the
biggest
issue
where
assets
fail
in
our
project
filter
octopus
managing
director
sam
reynolds
told
reuters
declining
to
name
projects
the
company
rejected
developers
and
project
lenders
said
they
need
to
consider
grid
congestion
which
can
curtail
power
that
gets
to
the
network
from
any
one
plant
intermittency
of
wind
and
solar

losses
called

mlfs
there
s
a
bit
of
nervousness
around
mlfs
curtailment
and
then
there
s
construction
and
commissioning
risk
said
stephen
panizza
head

at

mlfs
measure
energy
lost
over

networks
and
have
been
increasing
with
renewable
projects
being
on
the
outer
reaches
of
the
grid
weakening
returns
for
some
operators
another
factor
is
the
cost
of
the
extra
technology
to
keep
current
steady
on
the

as
more
intermittent

is
added

director
michael
vawser
says
other
projects
will
face
the
same
trouble
i
do
think
there
are
other
projects
caught
by
new
grid
regulations
that
will
lose
their
ppas
through
delays
in
being
allowed

connect

vawser
told
reuters
in
an
interview
in
november
neoen
which
has
built
gw
of
wind
and
solar
farms
and
the
world
s
biggest
battery
in
australia
over
the
past
four
years
said
in
a
recent
prospectus
it
had
collected
million
euros
million
in
damages
from
a
contractor
building
three
solar
farms
because
of
delays
despite
the
challenges
neoen
and
their
rivals
are
still
scouring
australia
for
more
opportunities
australia
is
still
an
attractive
market
for
us
