ruptured
by
suspected

exploded
in
central
mexico
authorities
said
on
saturday
as
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
defended
the
army
despite
its
failure
to
clear
the
site
before
the
blast
forensic
experts
filled
body
bags
with
charred
human
remains
in
the
field
where
the
explosion
occurred
on
friday
evening
by
the
town
of
tlahuelilpan
in
the
state
of
hidalgo
in
one
of
the
deadliest
incidents
to
hit
mexico
s
troubled
oil
infrastructure
in
years
one
witness
described
how
an
almost
festive
atmosphere
among
hundreds
of
local
residents
filling
containers
with
spilled
fuel
turned
to
horror
as
the
blast
scattered
the
crowd
in
all
directions
incinerating
clothing
and
inflicting
severe
burns
a
number
of
people
at
the
scene
told
reuters
that
local
shortages
in
gasoline
supply
since
lopez
obrador
launched
a
drive
to
stamp
out
fuel
theft
had
encouraged
the
rush
to
the
gushing
pipeline
everyone
came
to
see
if
they
could
get
a
bit
of
gasoline
for
their
car
there
isn
t
any
in
the
gas
stations
said
farmer
isaias
garcia
garcia
was
at
the
site
with
two
neighbours
but
waited
in
the
car
some
distance
away
some
people
came
out
burning
and
screaming
he
added
to
root
out
the
theft
lopez
obrador
in
late
december
ordered
pipelines
to
be
closed
but
that
led
to
shortages
in
central
mexico
including
hidalgo
where
local
media
this
week
said
more
than
half
of
the
gas
stations
were
at
times
shut
hidalgo
governor
omar
fayad
said
people
were
killed
and
people
injured
in
the
explosion
which
happened
as
residents
scrambled
to
get
buckets
and
drums
to
a
gush
at
the
pipeline
that
authorities
said
rose
up
to
feet
meters
high
fayad
said
the
condition
of
many
of
the
injured
was
deteriorating
and
that
some
had
burns
on
much
of
their
body
some
of
the
most
badly
injured
minors
could
be
moved
for
medical
attention
in
galveston
texas
he
added
hidalgo
attorney
general
raul
arroyo
said
bodies
were
so
badly
burned
that
they
could
take
a
long
time
to
identify
the
crackdown
on
fuel
theft
has
become
a
litmus
test
of
lopez
obrador
s
drive
to
tackle
corruption
in
mexico
and
to
stop
illegal
taps
draining
billions
of
dollars
from
the
state
oil
firm
petroleos
mexicanos
pemex
video
on
social
media
showed
people
filling
buckets
from
the
pipeline
during
daylight
hours
in
the
presence
of
the
armed
forces
before
the
blast
but
lopez
obrador
who
vowed
to
continue
the
crackdown
on
theft
defended
the
army
in
the
face
of
questions
about
why
soldiers
failed
to
prevent
the
tragedy
we
re
not
going
to
fight
fire
with
fire
the
veteran
leftist
said
we
think
that
people
are
good
honest
and
if
we
ve
reached
these
extremes
it
s
because
they
were
in
the
aftermath
soldiers
and
other
military
personnel
guarded
the
area
that
was
littered
with
shoes
clothes
and
containers
more
than
people
gathered
at
a
local
cultural
centre
on
saturday
afternoon
hoping
to
get
information
about
loved
ones
who
disappeared
officials
posted
information
about
dna
tests
for
identification
and
a
list
of
people
taken
to
hospital
lopez
obrador
said
the
army
had
been
right
to
avoid
a
confrontation
due
to
the
large
number
of
people
seeking
to
make
off
with
a
trove
of
free
fuel
a
few
litres
of
which
are
worth
more
than
the
daily
minimum
wage
in
mexico
blaming
previous
governments
for
neglecting
the
population
he
said
the
priority
was
to
eradicate
the
social
problems
and
lack
of
opportunities
that
had
made
people
risk
their
lives
he
rejected
suggestions
the
incident
was
linked
to
his
policy
still
lopez
obrador
had
vowed
to
tighten
security
in
sensitive
sections
of
the
oil
infrastructure
and
the
ruptured
pipeline
was
only
a
few
miles
away
from
a
major
oil
refinery
pemex
s
chief
executive
octavio
romero
told
reporters
that
there
had
been
illegal
fuel
taps
in
the
same
municipality
in
the
last
three
months
alone
neither
he
nor
the
president
said
exactly
when
the
valves
to
the
pipeline
were
closed
relatives
of
victims
stood
huddled
together
some
of
them
crying
after
the
massive
blast
much
of
the
rush
to
siphon
off
fuel
and
the
chaos
of
the
explosion
was
captured
on
mobile
phones
and
began
quickly
circulating
on
social
media
mexican
media
published
graphic
pictures
of
victims
from
the
blast
site
covered
in
burns
and
shorn
of
their
clothes
local
journalist
veronica
jimenez
arrived
at
the
scene
before
the
explosion
where
she
said
there
were
more
than
people
with
containers
to
collect
fuel
i
saw
families
mother
father
children
she
told
reuters
it
was
like
a
party
for
a
moment
you
could
even
hear
how
happy
people
when
the
blast
hit
people
ran
in
different
directions
pleading
for
help
some
burned
and
without
clothing
she
said
some
people
s
skin
came
off
it
was
very
ugly
horrible
people
screamed
and
cried
she
said
they
shouted
the
names
of
their
husbands
brothers
their
family
family
members
blocked
access
to
the
field
for
over
half
an
hour
saying
they
would
not
let
funeral
service
vehicles
pass
until
they
were
told
where
the
dead
were
being
taken
lopez
obrador
has
said
his
decision
to
close
pipelines
has
greatly
reduced
fuel
theft
but
the
death
toll
has
raised
questions
about
potentially
unintended
consequences
there
was
a
gasoline
shortage
people
one
way
or
another
wanted
to
be
able
to
move
around

local
farmer
ernesto
