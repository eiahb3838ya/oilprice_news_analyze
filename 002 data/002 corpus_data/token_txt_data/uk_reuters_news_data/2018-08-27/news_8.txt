by

comments
from
fed
chief
jerome
powell
at
the

symposium
on
friday
affirming
that
the
central
bank
was
sticking
with
its
strategy
of
gradual
rate
hikes
to
protect
economic
growth
sparked
a
rally
in
stocks
that
gathered
pace
as
a
new
week
swung
into
gear
helping
to
brighten
the
mood
and
mexican
trade
negotiators
are
seen
as
close
to
reaching
a
common
position
on
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
nafta
the
talks
will
resume
on
monday
and
a
positive
outcome
could
ease
concerns
about
an
escalation
in
global
trade
tensions
the
nafta
talks
add
to
the
sense
that
while
the
is
still
bogged
down
in
its
trade
conflict
with
china
it
is
perhaps
more
willing
to
compromise
elsewhere
such
as
with
mexico
and
the
eu
said
ulrich
leuchtmann
head
of
fx
and
emerging
market
research
at
commerzbank
in
frankfurt
it
s
decreasing
the
risk
of
a
global
trade
a
strengthening
in
the
chinese
yuan
one
causality
of
heightened
trade
tensions
also
boosted
sentiment
china
s
yuan
rose
to
a
near
high
to
the
dollar
after
the
central
bank
revived
a
factor
in
its
daily
fixing
to
support
the
currency
halting
a
record
slide
that
rattled
global
markets
the
announcement
was
seen
as
the
latest
signal
from
the
people
s
bank
of
china
that
is
not
comfortable
with
a
further
yuan
depreciation
that
could
spark
capital
outflows
from
the
cooling
economy

firmer

the
previous
late

session
close
the
offshore

rose
to
a
high
of
its
strongest
since
july
a
firmer
currency
helped
to
lift
chinese
shares
to
highs
with
the
shanghai
composite
index
closing
up
percent
hong
kong
stocks
posted
their
biggest
percentage
rise
in
six
months
the
move
raised
hopes
that
a
yuan
recovery
could
boost
companies
with
significant
costs
such
as
airlines
china
southern
airlines
gained
percent
and
air
china
rose
percent
china
just
seems
to
be
stabilising
its
currency
and
we
re
getting
used
to
that
fact
now
so
we
re
not
looking
at
an
cny
which
could
raise
issues
said
robert
carnell
chief
economist
and
head
of
research
at
ing
on
friday
the
s
p
index
and
nasdaq
composite
hit
record
highs
following
powell
s
comments
the

cemented
the

defined
by
some

s
p

touched
a
record
high

and
were
last
up
percent
in
europe
data
showed
german
business
morale
improved
by
much
more
than
expected
in
august
suggesting
that
concerns
about
a
global
trade
war
among
company
executives
in
europe
s
largest
economy
have
eased
the
ifo
economic
institute
said
its
business
climate
index
jumped
to
from
in
july
that
added
to
the
upbeat
tone
in
stocks
markets
but
weighed
on
german
bond
yields
which
rose
to
their
highest
level
in
more
than
at
percent
we
have
low
volumes
today
but
the
biggest
risks
the
market
were
discounting
were
trade
wars
so
any
reduction
in
trade
war
risk
such
as
nafta
talks
or
even
trump
trying
to
find
bilateral
deals
with
everyone
has
pushed
shares
to
new
records
and
will
support
markets
said
angelo
meda
head
of

and
a

manager
at
banor
sim
in
italy
the
global
economy
is
on
track
there
s
less
trade
war
risk
the
only
cloud
on
the
horizon
is
italy
meda
added
referring
to
upcoming
budget
talks
in
the
weeks
ahead
in

markets
the

steadied
against
its

lower

going
as

as
its

of
progress
in

nafta
talks
lifted
the

fell
while
