the
norwegian
oil
sector
is
set
for
a
promising
three
to
four
years
but
major
discoveries
must
be
made
to
prolong
activity
after
that
the
head
of
the
agency
overseeing
the
country
s
oil
and
gas
resources
told
reuters
norway
s
leading
industry
has
been
on
the
mend
for
the
past
two
years
after
a
downturn
during
which
oil
companies
slashed
investments
projects
and
jobs
we
are
still
in
the
upturn
phase
of
the
cycle
we
have
many
field
developments
ongoing
we
believe
the
next
years
are
looking
very
promising
bente
nyland
said
in
an
interview
on
the
margins
of
an
energy
conference
for
the
rest
of
the
year
and
the
next
we
expect
between
five
and
new
development
plans
to
be
submitted
to
authorities
she
said
adding
that
some
wells
would
likely
be
drilled
in
compared
with
around
last
year
then
we
will
begin
to
eat
into
what
possibilities
we
have
left
we
need
to
sow
more
we
hope
for
a
big
find
that
can
continue
activity
she
added
norway
s
equinor
submitted
on
monday
the
development
plan
for
the
second
phase
of
its
johan
sverdrup
asset
which
could
be
the
last
of
the
giant
north
sea
oilfields
it
is
clear
that
there
aren
t
a
lot
of
big
developments
after
that
and
that
is
worrying
nyland
said
if
no
big
finds
are
made
norway
must
work
on
making
the
smaller
finds
profitable
we
have
some
finds
we
think
we
can
develop
exploration
activity
has
increased
so
we
hope
discoveries
can
be
made
in
the
coming
years
she
said
meanwhile
oil
firms
are
conscious
of
not
letting
costs
inflate
at
the
rate
they
did
between
and
which
helped
precipitate
the
downturn
of
our
impression
so
far
is
that
the
companies
are
focused
and
conscious
of
costs
she
said
norway
s
oil
production
is
so
far
coming
below
the
norwegian
petroleum
directorate
s
forecasts
due
to
a
couple
of
unplanned
offshore
shutdowns
though
nyland
cautioned
the
situation
may
turn
before
the
end
of
the
year
gas
production
is
maintaining
itself
against
our
forecast
oil
production
looks
somewhat
lower
than
expected
but
the
year
is
not
over
she
said
for
the
early
prognosis
we
put
in
the
norwegian
national
budget
shows
an
upswing
in
petroleum
production
mostly
due
to
gas
which
represents
nearly
half
of
output
she
said
oil
production
should
increase
somewhat
due
to
developments
coming
online
still
it
won
t
be
a
massive
rise
it
is
an
uptick
