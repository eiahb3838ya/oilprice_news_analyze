africa
has
cancelled
plans
to
add

by

instead
aim

in
natural
gas
wind
and
other
energy
sources
the

announced
on

africa
s
only
nuclear

an

but
plans

to

hit
hurdles

until
energy
minister
jeff
radebe
said
while
releasing
the
government
s
new
integrated
resource
plan
irp
the
plan
also
showed
that
electricity
demand
on
the
grid
has
been
declining
russian
firm
rosatom
was
seen
as
a
frontrunner
to
build
the
additional
nuclear
capacity
several
meetings
between
zuma
and
russian
president
vladimir
putin
led
to
speculation
that
rosatom
had
secured
the
deal
before
the
launch
of
the
public
tender
south
africa
s
government
and
rosatom
denied
this
claim
but
soon
after
taking
over
from
zuma
in
february
president
cyril
ramaphosa
put
the
nuclear
expansion
on
the
back
burner
saying
the
plan
was
too
expensive
in
july
ramaphosa
said
putin
had
raised
the
subject
of
a
nuclear
deal
at
a
private
meeting
with
him
at
the
brics
summit
in
johannesburg
but
that
he
had
told
him
that
pretoria
could
not
sign
such
a
deal
for
now
radebe
on
monday
instead
outlined
expansion
plans
targeting
other
energy
sources
he
said
the
plan
calls
for
additional
capacity
of
mw
from
wind
and
mw
from
gas
mw
from
photovoltaic
panels
mw
from
hydro
and
mw
from
coal
