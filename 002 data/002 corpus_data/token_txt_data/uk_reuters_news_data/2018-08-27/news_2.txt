one
of
the
side
effects
of
president
donald
trump
s
escalating
trade
dispute
with
china
is
that
exports
of
crude
oil
to
the
world
s
biggest
importer
are
now
viewed
through
the
prism
of
politics
however
this
ignores
that
buyers
and
sellers
of
crude
are
generally
more
motivated
by
profit
margins
and
getting
the
right
grades
of
oil
to
maximise
the
productivity
of
their
plants
while
it
s
true
they
can
t
disregard
politics
and
this
is
especially
the
case
for
the
chinese
majors
it
s
worth
looking
at
the
economics
of
the
crude
trade
as
well
crude
exports
to
china
appear
set
to
slow
dramatically
in
september
with
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
oil
research
and
forecasts
showing
about
million
barrels
or
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
scheduled
for
arrival
this
would
be
down
from
around
bpd
in
august
and
would
also
be
the
weakest
month
since
march
this
year
the
slowdown
in
china
s
imports
of
crude
has
coincided
with
the
imposition
of
trade
tariffs
and
speculation
that
beijing
would
add
crude
to
its
list
of
products
to
be
hit
with
import
taxes
that
hasn
t
happened
yet
although
it
would
have
been
understandable
for
chinese
refiners
to
be
wary
of
buying
from
the
united
states
in
recent
weeks
however
the
pricing
of
the
various
grades
of
crude
oil
also
offers
an
explanation
as
to
why
china
stocked
up
on
crude
in
august
and
appears
to
have
shied
away
in
september
and
probably
october
as
well
chinese
traders
would
have
been
keen
to
buy
west
texas
intermediate
wti
types
of
crude
for
august
delivery
given
these
cargoes
would
have
been
arranged
in
late
may
and
early
june
the
discount
of
wti
crude
oil
futures
to
brent
futures
widened
to
a
barrel
on
june
and
traded
close
to
level
for
around
a
period
from
late
may
to
this
means
that
chinese
refiners
could
buy
wti
at
a
substantial
discount
to
brent
in
the
paper
market
which
would
encourage
them
to
take
physical
cargoes
from
the
gulf
in
the
physical
market
the
difference
between
oil
linked
to
wti
and
oil
linked
to
brent
wasn
t
quite
as
stark
but
was
nonetheless
in
favour
of
the
grades
nigerian
bonny
light
a
crude
oil
similar
to
and
priced
against
brent
was
trading
at
a
barrel
on
may
at
the
same
time
wti
delivered
at
the
magellan
east
houston
terminal
as
assessed
by
argus
media
was
at
a
discount
of
a
barrel
this
level
of
discount
is
enough
to
offset
the
slightly
higher
freight
cost
of
shipping
to
china
from
the
gulf
as
opposed
to
the
west
coast
of
africa
however
by
the
time
september
cargoes
for
china
would
have
been
arranged
the
numbers
had
moved
in
the
other
direction
with
bonny
light
trading
at
a
barrel
on
june
putting
it
at
a
discount
of
to
wti
houston
this
would
have
made
buying
west
african
light
crudes
more
attractive
than
cargoes
from
the
united
states
while
the
chinese
refiners
may
have
been
under
some
political
pressure
to
cut
back
on
buying
crude
it
was
probably
something
they
didn
t
feel
the
need
to
push
back
on
given
the
profits
weren
t
working
anyway
the
current
pricing
isn
t
particularly
supportive
of
chinese
buying
of
cargoes
with
bonny
light
at
a
slight
a
barrel
premium
over
wti
houston
for
refiners
prepared
to
offset
physical
trades
in
the
paper
market
the
discount
of
wti
futures
to
brent
contracts
was
at
a
barrel
on
widening
from
at
the
end
of
july
however
putting
the
paper
and
physical
pricing
together
suggests
that
crude
is
currently
not
a
compelling
purchase
for
chinese
refiners
compared
to
similar
grades
from
other
producers
such
as
those
in
west
africa
while
the
trade
spat
between
washington
and
beijing
could
worsen
to
the
point
where
crude
exports
to
china
are
rendered
completely
uncompetitive
in
the
meantime
it
probably
pays
to
looks
at
the
underlying
pricing
to
help
judge
the
likelihood
of
whether
exports
will
rise
or
fall
