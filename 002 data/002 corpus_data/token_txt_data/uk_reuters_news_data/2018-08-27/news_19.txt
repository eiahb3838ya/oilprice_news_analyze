french
energy
group
total
is
not
looking
at
investing
in
the
shale
oil
industry
the
company
s
chief
executive
said
on
monday
patrick
pouyanne
made
the
comment
when
asked
whether
peer
bp
s
billion
acquisition
of
shale
assets
from
bhp
billiton
had
made
the
sector
more
attractive
it
s
first
quite
expensive
second
we
don
t
have
the
human
resources
bp
had
the
human
resources
bp
had
already
a
position
so
i
can
understand
their
move
but
it
s
not
my
case
pouyanne
said
on
the
sidelines
of
an
oil
conference
bp
s
acquisition
of
about
producing
acres
marked
a
turning
point
for
the
group
since
the
deepwater
horizon
disaster
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
for
which
the
company
is
still
paying
off
more
than
billion
in
penalties
and
costs
shell
and
norway
s
equinor
have
also
invested
in
shale
but
eni
and
total
have
been
cautious

and
pioneer
natural
resources
chairman
scott
sheffield
rang
an
optimistic
note
when
asked
at
the
conference
about
european
oil
and
gas
companies
investing
in
shale
eventually
i
think
more
and
more
majors
will
get
there
because
it
s
the
region
for
the
next
years
in
the
world
and
so
if
you
re
not
in
the
permian
then
you
d
better
find
growth
somewhere
else
sheffield
said
he
was
referring
to
the
permian
basin
which
stretches
across
western
texas
and
eastern
new
mexico
