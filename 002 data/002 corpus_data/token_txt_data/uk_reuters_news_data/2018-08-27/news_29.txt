foundation
i
nsufficient
cash
is
hampering
a
flagship
international
fund
to
help
poor
nations
combat
climate
change
which
is
not
working
as
fast
and
efficiently
as
the
urgency
of
global
warming
requires
said
former
ban
the
green
climate
fund
gcf
was
established
at
climate
talks
in
to
channel
a
substantial
portion
of
the
billion
per
year
wealthy
nations
had
pledged
to
mobilise
by
for
efforts
to
curb
carbon
emissions
and
weather
the
impacts
of
climate
change
ban
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
that
decisions
by
president
donald
trump
to
withdraw
his
country
from
the
paris
agreement
on
global
warming
and
to
walk
away
from
promises
on
climate
finance
jeopardised
global
commitments
i
am
deeply
concerned
that
the
gcf
while
it
has
been
really
trying
to
work
has
not
been
fully
funded
ban
said
in
an
interview
from
south
korea
where
the
fund
is
also
based
with
the
pullout
of
this
paris
climate
agreement
we
are
not
sure
whether
billion
by
will
be
met
he
added
trump
s
predecessor
barack
obama
pledged
billion
to
the
gcf
but
only
billion
of
that
funding
has
been
delivered
of
a
total
of
more
than
billion
committed
to
the
fund
since
it
has
allocated
about
billion
for
projects
in
countries
to
curb
emissions
and
adapt
to
more
extreme
weather
and
rising
seas
but
the
last
meeting
of
its
board
in
july
was
blocked
by
disputes
over
policies
and
governance
meaning
no
new
projects
were
approved
ban
who
is
president
of
the
global
green
growth
institute
a
gcf
partner
described
that
result
as
quite
unfortunate
pressure
is
growing
including
from
the
climate
change
chief
for
the
gcf
to
get
back
to
business
before
major
climate
talks
in
poland
in
december
to
smooth
negotiations
on
a
rule
book
to
implement
the
paris
agreement
ban
said
the
fund
should
focus
on
getting
things
done
it
should
be
more
effective
it
should
be
more
agile
he
said
otherwise
if
you
have
to
wait
many
months
or
years
to
get
the
funding
by
that
time
we
will
miss
the
opportunity
to
mitigate
and
adapt
to
climate
change
according
to
the
gcf
projects
backed
by
about
billion
of
its
funding
are
now
being
rolled
out
from
climate
information
services
to
reduce
disasters
in
the
pacific
island
state
of
vanuatu
to
producing
sustainable
argan
oil
in
morocco
javier
manzanares
deputy
executive
director
of
the
fund
whose
chief
howard
bamsey
resigned
abruptly
at
july
s
meeting
described
the
implementation
figures
as
stellar
he
conceded
the
summer
meeting
was
a
setback
but
said
he
was
confident
that
the
board
will
find
a
way
to
solve
these
challenging
discussions
at
its
next
meeting
in
october
manzanares
is
hoping
projects
worth
up
to
billion
will
be
approved
and
about
new
agencies
accredited
to
lead
work
in
the
field
a
process
to
replenish
the
fund
s
coffers
should
also
be
triggered
he
said
i
believe
there
is
a
very
strong
commitment
to
making
things
happen
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
manzanares
underscored
the
urgency
of
topping
up
the
fund
s
finances
given
its
pipeline
of
projects
compared
with
available
money
we
are
now
dealing
with
a
situation
of
demand
that
clearly
outstrips
supply
he
said
the
difference
is
so
huge
that
there
is
a
true
need
to
start
if
all
goes
well
a
pledging
meeting
for
donors
could
be
held
late
next
year
he
noted
although
it
remains
unclear
whether
a
target
amount
will
be
set
ban
pointed
to
a
climate
summit
to
be
hosted
by
chief
antonio
guterres
in
september
as
a
key
moment
for
governments
to
outline
clearly
how
they
will
reach
their
wider
annual
goal
of
billion
otherwise
it
will
be
a
huge
embarrassment
for
the
developed
countries
not
to
be
able
to
have
a
formula
and
a
strong
commitment
on
this
ban
said
i
am
sure
that
they
will
work
on
this
matter
i
am
urging
them
