not
operational

delaying
the
process
a

diplomat
said
on

there
was
no
way
any
trade
with
this
mechanism
could
be
conducted
before
the
end
of
for
now
no

china
would
be
part
of
it
although
that
could
change
over
time
the
other
parties
to
the
nuclear
deal
see
it
as
an
important
bulwark
against

risk
of
wider
war
in
the
middle
east

have
reaffirmed
their
commitment
to
it
iran
has
said
it
could
