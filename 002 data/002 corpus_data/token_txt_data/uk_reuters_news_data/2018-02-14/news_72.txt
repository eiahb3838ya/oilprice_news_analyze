philippines, china to work out how to tap oil, gas that both sides claim
manila
reuters
the
philippines
and
china
have
agreed
to
set
up
a
special
panel
to
work
out
how
they
can
jointly
explore
oil
and
gas
in
part
of
the
south
china
sea
that
both
sides
lay
claim
without
having
to
address
the
explosive
issue
of
sovereignty
china
claims
most
of
the
south
china
sea
where
billion
in
trade
pass
every
year
and
has
competing
claims
in
various
parts
of
it
with
brunei
malaysia
taiwan
vietnam
and
the
philippines
it
s
just
the
start
of
a
process
philippine
ambassador
to
china
chito
sta
romana
told
reporters
late
on
tuesday
after
diplomats
from
both
sides
met
for
the
second
time
under
a
bilateral
mechanism
aimed
at
defusing
longstanding
maritime
tensions
he
said
the
decision
to
form
a
working
group
on
cooperating
on
energy
was
a
breakthrough
forming
an
agreement
for
a
joint
project
would
be
extremely
complex
and
sensitive
as
both
countries
claim
jurisdiction
of
the
site
of
the
oil
and
gas
reserves
so
sharing
them
could
be
deemed
legitimising
the
other
side
s
claim
or
even
ceding
sovereign
territory
the
idea
of
joint
development
was
first
hatched
in
but
disputes
and
the
sovereignty
issue
have
stopped
it
from
materialising
but
time
is
of
the
essence
for
the
philippines
which
relies
heavily
on
energy
imports
to
fuel
its
economy
that
is
complicated
by
estimates
that
its
only
domestic
natural
gas
source
the
offshore
malampaya
field
will
be
depleted
by
sta
romana
said
a
second
coordinating
group
was
created
to
address
sovereignty
issues
and
to
prevent
any
crisis
from
escalating

the

the

court
of

the

in
to
question
that
among
other
bones
of
contention
the
tribunal
s
ruling
which
china
refuses
to
recognise
included
clarifying
that
the
reed
bank
was
within
the
nautical
mile
exclusive
economic
zone
of
the
philippines
and
therefore
it
had
sovereign
rights
to
exploit
resources
