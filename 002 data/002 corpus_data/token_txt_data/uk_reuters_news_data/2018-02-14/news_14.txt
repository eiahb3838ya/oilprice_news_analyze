reuters
agricultural
merchant
bunge
ltd
reported
a
loss
for
the
fourth
quarter
on
wednesday
the
latest
in
a
string
of
poor
results
that
has
left
the
company
s
management
fending
off
takeover
bids
from
rivals
several
years
of
abundant
grains
supply
on
global
markets
have
made
it
tough
for
bunge
and
its
rivals
to
turn
a
profit
on
their
core
business
buying
processing
and
selling
corn
soy
and
wheat
that
has
left
the
sector
open
to
consolidation
and
bunge
has
received
interest
from
both
rival

chief
executive
soren
schroder
told

the
company
reported
a
million
loss
for
the
fourth
quarter
the
loss
compared
with
a
profit
of
million
a
year
earlier
is
likely
to
raise
shareholder
pressure
on
executives
to
find
a
buyer
or
take
more
aggressive
steps
to
shore
up
the
agribusiness
division
they
have
taken
corrective
actions
said
william
densmore
senior
director
at
fitchratings
after
the
earnings
were
announced
however
management
credibility
has
lessened
during
the
past
year
and
any
further
operating
challenges
in
could
likely
ratchet
up
the
bunge
whose
shares
fell
more
than
percent
in

warned
analysts
the
impact
on
margins
of
global
grains

expected
to
spill
into

management
insisted

europe
tightening

soymeal
supplies
and
rising

as
motives
for
optimism
for

also
make
savings
on

has
made
in
