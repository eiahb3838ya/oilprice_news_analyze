analysis-hail shale, but deepwater oil fights back

penguins
royal
dutch
shell
s
latest
oil
and
gas
development
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
british
north
sea
epitomises
the
new
doctrine
for
deepwater
projects
keep
it
cheap
and
simple
shunned
during
the
oil
price
crash
of
deepwater
projects
are
being
embraced
again
a
challenge
to
the
surge
in
onshore
shale
output
penguins
the
first
new
major
deepwater
project
this
year
will
rejuvenate
the
field
by
drilling
new
wells
metres
feet
underwater
and
connecting
them
to
a
new
production
vessel
due
for
completion
in
at
a
cost
of
around
billion
penguins
will
cost
a
fraction
of
the
average
of
giant
developments
earlier
this
decade
producing
a
modest
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
a
day
it
is
another
example
of
how
we
are
unlocking
development
opportunities
with
lower
costs
andy
brown
head
of
shell
s
oil
and
gas
production
division
said
like
shell
companies
such
as
exxon
mobil
total
and
bp
have
in
recent
years
radically
changed
the
way
they
design
offshore
fields
deploying
steel
platforms
out
at
sea
to
make
them
simpler
and
faster
to
build
and
able
to
challenge
the
economics
of
shale
fields
such
as
the
permian
basin
in
texas
as
executives
gain
confidence
that
their
companies
can
make
a
profit
with
oil
at
around
a
barrel
less
than
half
the
level
of
the
early
boards
are
set
to
approve
more
projects
oil
currently
trades
at
around
a
barrel
analysts
at
bernstein
expect
around
new
offshore
projects
to
be
approved
in
compared
with
last
year
and
in
when
project
numbers
fell
to
the
lowest
since
at
least
companies
including
exxon
shell
and
bp
have
set
a
rigid
cost
ceiling
for
new
projects
requiring
them
to
be
profitable
with
oil
at
a
barrel
in
order
to
withstand
an
uncertain
outlook
clouded
by
the
rise
of
electric
vehicles
as
a
result
most
new
projects
are
set
to
be
significantly
smaller
than
the
traditional
field
size
averaging
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
compared
with
last
year
according
to
bernstein
you
will
see
more
deepwater
over
time
for
sure
bernard
looney
head
of
bp
s
oil
and
gas
production
division
told
reuters
in
january
bp
is
expected
to
approve
a
number
of
projects
this
year
he
added
including
in
senegal
mauritania
oman
and
azerbaijan
leaner
projects
can
be
achieved
by
drilling
simpler
wells
and
connecting
them
to
existing
platforms
and
pipelines
in
what
is
known
as
infill
drilling
or
by
swapping
bespoke
gear
for
equipment
and
by
processing
vast
amounts
of
data
to
streamline
oil
field
construction
a
sharp
drop
in
rig
and
services
costs
by
as
much
as
percent
in
some
cases
over
the
past
three
years
has
further
helped
reduce
the
cost
of
projects
much
is
made
of
the
permian
its
flexibility
and
the
returns
there
but
actually
infill
drilling
for
a
decade
creates
enormous
sources
of
money
looney
said
offshore
oil
projects
there
are
exceptions
to
the
rule
some
fields
are
so
vast
that
they
require
massive
investment
while
remaining
profitable
at
low
oil
prices
among
the
largest
projects
expected
to
be
approved
this
year
are
petrobras
s
libra
ii
in
brazil
at
an
expected
cost
of
billion
shell
s
bonga
southwest
in
nigeria
at
billion
and
exxon
s
mamba
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
project
in
mozambique
at
billion
according
to
analysts
at
jefferies
for
all
the
buzz
around
shale
production
it
accounts
for
around
percent
of
the
world
s
crude
supply
of
around
million
barrels
per
day
while
offshore
production
accounts
for
over
one
quarter
the
scale
of
the
highly
complex
projects
one
platform
can
produce
bpd
in
some
cases
helped
tap
new
resources
in
recent
decades
to
meet
surging
global
demand
for
energy
but
some
deepwater
projects
were
plagued
by
huge
cost
and
delays
one
of
the
most
famous
examples
being
the
giant
kazakh
field
kashagan
later
dubbed
as
costs
ballooned
from
billion
to
billion
but
after
years
of
spending
cuts
companies
urgently
need
to
develop
new
resources
to
offset
the
natural
decline
of
fields
which
can
reach
percent
per
year
when
you
look
at
the
mix
you
need
offshore
you
need
deepwater
the
onshore
by
itself
won
t
be
enough
to
make
up
for
the
decline
rates
that
you
are
seeing
globally
lorenzo
simonelli
chief

company
baker
hughes
told
reuters
exxon
the
world
s
top
publicly

oil
company
last
year
gave
the
for
the
development
of
the
liza
field
in
guyana
the
project
is
expected
to
generate
returns
with
oil
at
the
company
said
oil
majors
have
made
a
number
of
major
discoveries
in
recent
months
exxon
in
guyana
bp
in
the
north
sea
shell
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
eni
and
total
offshore
cyprus
and
their
development
will
hinge
on
keeping
costs
low
discipline
has
to
stay
we
re
very
determined
in
this
space
we
re
not
going
to
say
that
now
that
the
oil
prices
are
back
up
let
s
do
more
let
s
spend
more
