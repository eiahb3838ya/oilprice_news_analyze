asian
share
markets
turned
mixed
on
wednesday
as
investor
nerves
were
strained
ahead
of
a
inflation
report
that
could
soothe
or
inflame
fears
of
faster
rate
hikes
globally
japanese
demand
for
yen
also
saw
the
dollar
break
last
year
s
low
and
skid
to
a
trough
at
dragging
the
currency
down
broadly
that
in
turn
pressured
japan
s
nikkei
which
slipped
as
much
as
percent
to
test
lows
dealers
said
there
was
a
lot
of
focus
on
the
moving
average
at
as
a
break
there
would
ring
bearish
alarm
bells
the
nikkei
was
last
down

at
other
asian

were
steadier

pulled

by

indices
moves
elsewhere
were
tentative
with
investors
clearly
scarred
by
the
return
of
volatility
bofa
merrill
lynch
s
february
fund
manager
survey
found
a
record
jump
in
the
net
percentage
of
investors
taking
out
protection
against
a
sharp
fall
in
equity
markets
funds
were
rotating
into
cash
and
out
of
equities
reducing
their
stock
allocation
to
a
net
percent
overweight
from
percent
the
largest
decline
in
two
years
much
now
rested
on
what
the
consumer
price
report
showed
for
january
given
it
was
the
risk
of
accelerating
inflation
that
triggered
the
global
rout
in
the
first
place
headline
consumer
price
inflation
is
forecast
to
slow
to
an
annual
percent
and
core
inflation
to
percent
an
outcome
that
could
help
calm
nerves
the
concern
is
the
figures
could
surprise
on
the
high
side
as
wages
did
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
the
risk
seems
asymmetric
to
me
said
greg
mckenna
chief
market
strategist
at
cfd
and
fx
provider
axitrader
even
a
slightly
higher
number
could
set
the
cat
among
the
pigeons
given
the
late
cycle
stimulus
the
trump
administration
is
pumping
into
the
in
currency
markets
the
dollar
was
under
fire
again
losing
percent
on
a
basket
of
currencies
to
the
euro
firmed
to
and
away
from
last
week
s
trough
at
it
was
aided
by
expectations
german
gdp
data
later
on
wednesday
would
show
strong
growth
analysts
said
investors
were
becoming
nervous
about
the
prospect
of
swelling
budget
and
trade
deficits
given
the
passage
of
huge
tax
cuts
and
spending
plans
the
of
the
twin
deficit
should
send
shivers
down
the
dollar
s
spine
said
mark
mccormick
north
american
head
of
fx
strategy
at
td
securities
he
noted
the
imf
had
estimated
that
a
percent
rise
in
the
budget
deficit
led
to
a
percent
increase
in
the
current
account
deficit
that
suggested
the
twin
deficit
could
exceed
percent
of
gdp
by
the
end
of
the
decade
all
of
which
had
to
be
funded
by
offshore
money
those
numbers
do
not
bode
well
for
the
greenback
in
the
medium
term
concluded
mccormick
the
drop
in
the
dollar
gave

fillip
