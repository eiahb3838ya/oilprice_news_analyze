the

slid
to
a
low
against
the
yen
on
wednesday
while
world
stock
markets
found
firmer
ground
ahead
of
inflation
numbers
that
could
soothe
or
inflame
fears
of
faster
hikes
globally
european
stock
markets
were
broadly
higher
thanks
to
strong
earnings
results
and
data
confirmed
the
fastest
euro
zone
economic
growth
for
more
than
years
in
indexes
in
london
paris
and
frankfurt
were
up
around
percent
each
while
higher
stock

pointed
to
a
positive
start
for
wall
street
shares
which
climbed
on
tuesday
for

volatility
index
meanwhile
dipped
to

at
a
sign
that
a
degree
of
calm
had
returned
to

after
last

ructions
still
asian

were

ahead
of
the
january
inflation
report
at
gmt
that
data
has
taken
on
particular
significance
after
recent
strong
wage
growth
data
prompted
investors
to
ratchet
up
expectations
for
rate
hikes
this
year
and
sparked
a
rout
in
world
stock
markets
markets
have
suddenly
woken
up
to
the
fact
that
central
banks
are
tightening
rates
and
economists
have
been
saying
for
a
year
now
that
inflation
is
being
artificially
suppressed
by
forces
said
ubs
global
chief
economist
paul
donovan
as
a
result
today
s
data
has
the
potential
to
get
investors
really
excited
if
it
comes
in
higher
than
headline
consumer
price
inflation
is
forecast
to
slow
to
an
annual
percent
and
core
inflation
to
percent
an
outcome
that
could
help
calm
nerves
unease
about
the
looming
inflation
data
was
perhaps
greatest
in
currency
markets
where
the
dollar
slid
to
a
low
against
the
japanese
currency
at
around

it
recovered
to

in
london
but
was
still
down

on
the

measured
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
was
steady
at
having
dipped
to
a
low
the
euro
was
flat
at
around
the
dollar
index
has
now
given
up
of
the
gains
it
notched
up
this
month
when
investors
rushed
into
the
greenback
as
equity
markets
suffered
a
violent
my
read
is
the
dollar
has
not
benefited
in
line
with
previous
corrections
of
this
magnitude
the
dollar
move
also
reflects
the
fact
this
has
not
yet
become
a
correction
where
markets
and
investors
are
worried
about
the
macro
backdrop
said
kamakshya
trivedi
of

today
s
cpi
will
be
key
to
see
if
the

extends
further
