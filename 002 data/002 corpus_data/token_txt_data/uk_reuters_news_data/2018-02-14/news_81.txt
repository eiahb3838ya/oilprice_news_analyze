turned
mixed
on

as
investor
nerves
were
strained
ahead
of
a
inflation
report
that
could
soothe
or
inflame
fears
of
faster

the
largest
decline
in

years
much
now
rested
on
what
the
consumer
price
report
showed
for
january
given
it
was
the
risk
of
accelerating
inflation
that
triggered
the
global

in
the

headline
consumer
price
inflation
is
forecast
to
slow
to
an
annual
percent
and
core
inflation
to
percent
an
outcome
that
could
help
calm
nerves
the
concerns
is
the
figures
could
surprise
on
the
high
side
as

did
a
couple
of

the
risk
seems
asymmetric
to
me
said
greg
mckenna
chief
market
strategist
at
cfd
and
fx
provider
axitrader
even
a
slightly
higher
number
could
set
the
cat
among
the
pigeons
given
the
late
cycle
stimulus
the
trump
administration
is
pumping
into
the
in
currency
markets
the
yen
remained
firm
after
a
sudden
bout
of
buying
from
japanese
investors
on
tuesday
tipped
bids
around
and
took
the
yen
to
a
peak
the

was
last
down
percent
at

and
set
to
threaten
support
around
the

fared

gdp
data
later
wednesday
would
show
strong
growth
against
a
basket

the
dollar
was
down
at
having
shed
percent
overnight
analysts
said
investors
were
becoming
nervous
about
the
prospect
of
swelling
budget
and
trade
deficits
given
the
passage
of
huge
tax
cuts
and
spending
plans
the
of
the
twin
deficit
should
send
shivers
down
the
dollar
s
spine
said
mark
mccormick
north
american
head
of
fx
strategy
at
td
securities
he
noted
the
imf
had
estimated
that
a
percent
rise
in
the
budget
deficit
led
to
a
percent
increase
in
the
current
account
deficit
that
suggested
the
twin
deficit
could
exceed
percent
of
gdp
by
the
end
of
the
decade
all
of
which
had
to
be
funded
by
offshore
money
those
numbers
do
not
bode
well
for
the
greenback
in

concluded

the
