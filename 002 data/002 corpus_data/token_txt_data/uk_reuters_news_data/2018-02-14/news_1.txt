in
a

backed
a
gasoline

problems
the
official
added
trump
expressed
confidence
on
wednesday
a
deal
could
be
reached
this
is
an
issue
where
i
really
believe
we
can
find
common
ground
he
said
some
in
congress
have
said
they
are
open
to
the
idea
of
increasing
the
gasoline
tax
but
that
trump
would
need
to
provide
cover
to
win
approval
for
the
politically
risky
move
republican
senator
john
barrasso
who
attended
the
meeting
said
he
opposed
a
hike
many
in
congress
say
such
an
increase
has
little
or
no
chance
of
approval
trump
wants
to
use
billion
in
federal
funds
to
try
to
stimulate
trillion
in
infrastructure
improvements
over
years
but
would
cut
an
equivalent
amount
in
projected
infrastructure
spending
from
the
federal
budget
as
it
shifted
more
costs
to
states
and
cities
democrats
insist
any
infrastructure
plan
must
include
new
revenue
congress
has
transferred
nearly
billion
to
the
highway
trust
fund
since
lawmakers
to
maintain
current
spending
levels
would
need
to
approve
an
additional
billion
from
through
last
month
the
chamber
of
commerce
backed
hiking
fuel
taxes
by
cents
a
gallon
which
it
said
would
raise
billion
over
the
next
years
