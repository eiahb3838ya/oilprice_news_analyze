woodside
petroleum
australia
s
biggest
independent
gas
and
oil
producer
is
set
to
raise
a
billion
billion
to
fund
the
purchase
of
exxonmobil
corp
s
stake
in
the
scarborough
gas
field
and
to
support
projects
at
home
and
in
west
africa
the
move
puts
woodside
seen
by
some
as
short
on
growth
prospects
in
a
better
position
to
develop
the
scarborough
field
off
western
australia
as
it
will
have
a
stake
and
take
over
running
the
project
now
estimated
to
cost
up
to
billion
woodside
s
share
of
that
cost
would
be
up
to
billion
analysts
raised
concern
that
even
with
the
large
equity
raising
the
company
may
have
to
come
back
to
investors
in
a
few
years
to
fund
development
of
scarborough
and
the
competing
browse
lng
project
also
off
western
australia
there
s
a
lot
of
money
to
pay
said
macquarie
analyst
andrew
hodge
woodside
chief
executive
peter
coleman
said
the
company
could
now
accelerate
development
of
scarborough
to
feed
an
expansion
of
its
pluto
lng
plant
which
would
help
fill
a
need
for
new
lng
supply
particularly
as
chinese
demand
grows
rapidly
this
gives
greater
alignment
and
certainty
over
a
high
value
opportunity
coleman
told
analysts
on
a
conference
call
the
difference
between
supply
and
demand
is

woodside
announced
the
equity
raising
