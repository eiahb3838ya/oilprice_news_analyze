the
world
s
exporter
of
steelmaking
coal
said
on
wednesday
that
growing
global
steel
production
is
expected
to
boost
demand
for
its
coal
in
though
coal
trade
competition
will
also
likely
rise
teck
which
also
mines
copper
zinc
gold
and
oil
sands
said
it
is
feeling
pretty
good
about
after
reporting
financial
results
most
of
us
forget
what
this
feels
like
but
it
s
certainly
very
good
for
commodity
markets
and
they
are
now
demand
driven
rather
than
supply
driven
chief
executive
don
lindsay
said
on
a
conference
call
we
see
continued
strength
in
commodity
prices
and
teck
is
certainly
well
positioned
to
take
advantage
of
steelmaking
coal
demand
is
expected
to
keep
climbing
in
teck
said
while
ongoing
logistics
and
production
issues
at
key
australian
mines
support
prices
it
is
unclear
how
an
expected
recovery
in
australian
exports
this
year
and
coal
trade
rebalancing
will
affect
pricing
but
teck
said
it
can
respond
to
changing
markets
teck
sold
million
tonnes
of
steelmaking
coal
in
the
fourth
quarter
at
an
average
realized
price
of
per
tonne
it
sees
output
of
million
to
million
tonnes
of
steelmaking
coal
production
in
to
will
range
between
million
and
million
tonnes
despite
this
year
s
closure
of
coal
mountain
operations
copper
production
is
forecast
at
to
tonnes
in
and
to
tonnes
for
to
zinc
production
is
seen
at
to
tonnes
in
dropping
to
between
and
tonnes
in
to
teck
expects
its
share
of
production
from
fort
hills
oils
sands
mine
at
million
to
million
barrels
of
bitumen
in
and
million
barrels
in
to
it
holds
a

stake
in
fort
hills
which
produced
its
first
oil
in
january
with
partners
suncor
energy
and
total
sa
production
is
seen
reaching
at
least
percent
of
capacity
by
lindsay
said
he
hopes
teck
will
build
up
cash
reserves
from
high
commodity
prices
and
see
copper
supplies
tighten
before
moving
ahead
with
its
