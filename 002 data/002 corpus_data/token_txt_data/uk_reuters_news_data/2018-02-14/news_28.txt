opec
would
do
better
to
leave
the
oil
market
slightly
short
of
supplies
rather
than
ending
too
early
a
deal
on
cutting
output
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
on
wednesday
oil
prices
have
slid
nearly
percent
in
the
past
three
weeks
together
with
a
broader
decline
in
the
stock
market
due
to
fears
about
global
inflation
and
rising
oil
production
the
decline
comes
at
a
bad
time
for
saudi
arabia
which
needs
high
and
stable
oil
prices
if
it
is
to
succeed
in
turning
the
planned
share
listing
of
oil
giant
saudi
aramco
this
year
into
the
world
s
biggest
share
sale
if
we
have
to
err
on
the
market
a
little
bit
so
be
it
falih
said
after
meeting
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
in
riyadh
novak
and
other
russian
officials
also
met
saudi
king
salman
in
the
saudi
capital
on
wednesday
rather
than
quitting
too
early
and
finding
out
we
were
dealing
with
less
reliable
information
stay
the
course
and
make
sure
that
inventories
are
where
the
industry
needs
them
falih
said
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
of
which
saudi
arabia
is
leader
has
agreed
to
extend
oil
supply
cuts
with
russia
and
other
producers
until
the
end
of
moscow
however
has
signalled
a
gradual
exit
might
be
needed
from
the
second
half
of
this
year
falih
has
insisted
the
cuts
will
continue
throughout
and
to
avoid
shocking
the
market
any
exit
after
that
would
be
very
gradual
on
wednesday
falih
said
opec
and
its
allies
would
need
to
consider
in
coming
months
how
to
adjust
targets
including
how
to
measure
the
average
of
oil
stockpiles
opec
has
made
the
average
its
main
target
and
managed
to
reduce
the
glut
to
million
barrels
above
that
benchmark
from
million
when
the
cuts
began
in
falih
said
opec
should
take
into
account
inventories
floating
storage
and
oil
in
transit
at
present
targets
are
based
on
stockpiles
in
industrialised
oecd
nations
it
is
way
too
premature
to
discuss
an
exit
strategy
do
we
need
to
adjust
for
rising
demand
and
look
at
forward
day
cover
how
do
we
deal
with
inventory
it
s
less
transparent
and
reliable
falih
said
we
have
to
think
of
the
global
market
the
centre
of
demand
has
shifted
from
oecd
to
we
will
discuss
it
in
april
and
june
i
think
we
are
going
to
be
sticking
with
our
policy
throughout
and
that
is
necessary
to
balance
markets
as
novak
and
falih
met
in
riyadh
the
saudi
energy
ministry
said
it
would
restrain
oil
exports
in
march
despite
lower
domestic
need
for
crude
the
kingdom
will
keep
its
crude
exports
below
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
next
month
despite
a
maintenance
shutdown
of
the
samref
refinery
the
ministry
said
confirming
a
plan
given
by
industry
sources
saudi
arabia
remains
focused
on
working
down
excess
oil
inventories
a
ministry
spokesman
said
in
a
statement
market
volatility
is
a
common
concern
for
producers
and
consumers
and
the
kingdom
is
committed
to
mitigating
this
volatility
and
moderating
its
negative
impacts
by
responsibly
meeting
its
pledges
under
the
supply
deal
opec
mohammad
barkindo
who
was
also
in
riyadh
said
oil
demand
would
grow
this
year
at
healthy
levels
and
that
data
pointed
to
continued
high
compliance
by
producers
in
january
with
their
pledges
under
the
supply
deal
opec
has
delivered
more
than
percent
of
the
output
cuts
that
members
pledged
under
the
deal
according
to
figures
from
opec
and
other
analysts
helped
in
part
by
an
involuntary
drop
in
venezuela
where
output
is
falling
amid
an
economic
crisis
the
saudi
ministry
also
said
production
by
aramco
in
march
would
be
bpd
below
february
s
level
suggesting
saudi
arabia
will
continue
to
pump
less
than
its
opec
target
