paris
reuters
french
grid
operator
rte
would
be
keen
to
play
a
part
in
european
union
power
grid
consolidation
and
in
favour
of
changing
its
legal
status
in
order
to
achieve
that
its
chief
executive
said
on
wednesday
the
largest
grid
operator
in
europe
rte
is
majority
owned
by
french
utility
edf
but
it
remains
a
purely
national
player
in
an
industry
where
more
and
more
grid
operators
have
stakes
in
foreign
grids
rte
is
not
meant
to
be
merely
an
observer
in
the
consolidation
of
the
european
power
grid
industry
rte
chief
executive
francois
brottes
told
reporters
most
european
power
grids
were
split
off
from
the
utilities
that
owned
them
more
than
a
decade
ago
in
a
process
called
unbundling
that
was
supposed
to
give
all
power
producers
equal
access
to
the
networks
but
rte
remains
one
of
a
few
independent
transmission
operators
itos
still
owned
by
vertically
integrated
utilities
there
are
just
eight
itos
among
europe
s
grid
operators
and
these
itos
are
not
allowed
to
buy
stakes
in
unbundled
independent
power
grid
operators
but
brottes
said
he
would
be
in
favour
of
changing
rte
s
ito
status
to
be
able
to
take
part
in
any
power
grid
consolidation
i
personally
think
we
should
get
out
of
it
he
said
brottes
who
met
energy
sector
reporters
said
that
he
agreed
that
not
much
could
happen
in
terms
of
major
grid
operator
consolidation
in
europe
as
long
as
a
key
player
like
rte
remains
an
ito
we
can
only
court
other
itos
we
can
not
try
to
seduce
other
companies
he
said
brottes
said
the
european
grid
industry
is
consolidating
right
now
and
that
therefore
rte
needs
to
reconsider
its
business
model
in
rte
had
prepared
a
bid
for
greek
grid
operator
admie
one
of
the
few
other
european
grid
operators
with
the
ito
status
but
it
was
outbid
by
the
state
grid
corporation
of
china
of
china
corporation
sgcc
which
paid
million
euros
for
a
percent
stake
sgcc
also
bought
stakes
in
grid
operators
in
portugal
and
italy
in
recent
years
the
chinese
are
already
in
portugal
and
italy
and
in
germany
they
are
negotiating
now
the
chinese
want
to
buy
everything
that
is
for
sale
brottes
said
brottes
said
its
status
as
a
regulated
company
charging
tariffs
also
made
it
harder
to
bid
for
foreign
peers
we
are
not
an
investment
fund
we
can
not
put
a
bag
of
dollars
on
the
table
our
regulator
would
challenge
that
