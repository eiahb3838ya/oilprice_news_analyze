paris
reuters
french
sigfox
which
builds
networks
to
connect
washing
machines
and
other
objects
to
the
internet
says
it
is
struggling
to
meet
its
growth
targets
due
to
high
expectations
for
alternative
forthcoming
services
the
company
whose
shareholders
include
french
oil
major
total
and
group
missed
its
revenue
target
last
year
ceo
ludovic
le
moan
told
reuters
on
wednesday
but
it
still
sees
good
prospects
for
its
technology
and
aims
to
break
even
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
this
year
if
it
reaches
that
target
it
could
seek
a
stock
market
listing
le
moan
said
in
an
interview
sigfox
seeks
to
tap
into
the
burgeoning
internet
of
things
iot
sector
where
it
faces
competition
from
two
other
emerging
networks
lora
backed
by
french
telecom
operator
orange
and
equipment
maker
cisco
systems
and
which
is
backed
by
japan
s
softbank
these
three
companies
wireless
networks
enable
devices
to
transfer
small
volumes
of
data
over
a
wide
area
while
maintaining
battery
life
over
many
years
whereas
services
can
carry
much
bigger
volumes
but
cost
a
lot
more
there
s
a
lot
of
noise
around
these
days
le
moan
said
but
these
technologies
that
are
being
put
in
place
are
much
more
costly
he
added
for
telecom
players
this
is
all
about
generating
new
the
first
standards
for
the
next
generation
of
broadband
mobile
internet
were
recently
approved
with
first
commercial
offers
expected
in
or
the
for
will
cost
billions
of
euros
for
each
national
market
compared
with
a
few
million
for
sigfox
s
iot
networks
le
moan
said
objects
connected
through
sigfox
s
networks
range
from
house
alarms
to
public
waste
containers
and
water
metres
set
up
in
the
company
generated
revenues
of
million
euros
in
up
from
million
in
but
million
short
of
its
initial
target
le
moan
said
higher
volume
usage
of
iot
chips
such
as
those
made
by
stmicroelectronics
or
texas
instruments
will
help
drive
down
the
cost
of
iot
chips
to
a
few
cents
per
unit
making
the
technology
more
attractive
he
said
sigfox
which
has
raised
more
million
euros
over
the
last
seven
years
and
has
staff
currently
has
million

objects
on
its
networks
