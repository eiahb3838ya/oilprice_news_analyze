update 4-trump weighs tariffs, quotas on u.s. steel, aluminum imports
washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
said
on
tuesday
he
was
considering
a
range
of
options
to
address
steel
and
aluminium
imports
that
he
said
were
unfairly
hurting
producers
including
tariffs
and
quotas
trump
s
comments
his
strongest
signal
in
months
that
he
will
take
at
least
some
action
to
restrict
imports
of
the
two
metals
came
in
a
meeting
with
a
bipartisan
group
of
senators
and
representatives
at
the
white
house
reporters
were
present
for
part
of
the
meeting
some
of
the
lawmakers
urged
him
to
act
decisively
to
save
steel
and
aluminium
plants
in
their
states
but
others
urged
caution
because
higher
prices
would
hurt
downstream
manufacturers
that
consume
steel
and
aluminium
trump
is
weighing
options
presented
last
month
by
the
commerce
department
in
parallel
section
investigations
into
whether
import
restrictions
on
steel
and
aluminium
are
needed
to
protect
national
security
the
probes
were
authorized
under
a
trade
law
that
has
not
been
invoked
since
what
we
re
talking
about
is
tariffs
quotas
trump
said
to
the
group
part
of
the
options
would
be
tariffs
coming
in
as
they
dump
steel
they
pay
tariffs
substantial
tariffs
which
means
the
united
states
would
actually
make
a
lot
of
trump
said
that
the
steel
and
aluminium
industries
were
being
decimated
by
dumping
and
talked
about
the
empty
steel
mills
he
saw
on
the
campaign
trail
in
i
look
at
it
two
ways
i
want
to
keep
prices
down
but
i
also
want
to
make
sure
that
we
have
a
steel
industry
and
an
aluminium
industry
and
we
do
need
that
for
national
defence
trump
said
steel
stocks
rose
broadly
after
the
comments
with
the
s
p
steel
index
closing
up
percent
and
outperforming
the
broader
market
alcoa
inc
shares
ended
percent
higher
with
century
aluminum
up
percent
trump
now
has
until
around
april
to
decide
whether
to
impose
steel
import
curbs
and
april
to
decide
on
aluminium
restrictions
the
commerce
department
has
not
revealed
its
recommendations
in
the
probes
launched
last
spring
but
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
told
the
lawmakers
that
section
powers
can
be
applied
in
a
much
more
surgical
way
that
could
lead
to
tariffs
on
imports
from
certain
countries
and
quotas
from
other
nations
suspected
of
transhipping
products
some
lawmakers
came
away
from
the
meeting
with
the
impression
that
trump
would
impose
some
restrictions
but
understood
the
need
for
a
balanced
approach
my
belief
is
he
ll
take
some
action
but
he
was
truly
open
to
seeking
input
at
the
meeting
today
senator
roy
blunt
a
missouri
republican
told
reporters
at
the
capitol
blunt
who
said
missouri
industries
both
make
and
consume
steel
and
aluminium
told
trump
in
the
meeting
i
think
we
do
need
to
be
careful
here
that
we
don
t
start
a
reciprocal
battle
on
several
lawmakers
cited
the
need
to
maintain
energy
independence
and
the
electrical
grid
they
urged
steps
to
protect
producers
of
oil
drilling
and
transport
pipe
and
noted
ak
steel
is
the
last
american
producer
of
electrical
steel
for
electric
transformers
senator
rob
portman
a
republican
from
ohio
told
trump
that
without
relief
from
imports
ak
steel
is
going
to
pull
out
of
this
business
so
we
won
t
have
the
steel
that
goes
into
our
transformers
and
our
republican
senator
pat
toomey
of
pennsylvania
cautioned
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
trump
to
justify
a
national
security
ruling
when
defence
products
consume
only
percent
of
domestic
steel
so
i
think
it
s
implausible
to
believe
that
we
re
not
able
to
meet
the
needs
of
our
defence
industry
which
is
absolutely
essential
he
said
steelmakers
recently
urged
trump
to
take
broad
action
to
reduce
steel
imports
to
curb
global
excess

economy
was
recovering
and
all
parties
should
cherish
the
momentum
and
send
signals
of
cooperation
and
mutual
benefit
at
this
time
any
unilateral
or
protectionist
moves
would
harm
countries
and
damage
the

environment
geng
told
reporters
in

all

should
make
an
effort

avoid
a
chinese

will
be
met

countermeasures
