the
arbitration
between
australia

shelf
nws
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
project
and
korea
gas
corp
kogas
over
the
price
of
an
expired
supply
contract
comes
as
asian
buyers
are
putting
pressure
on
producers
to
grant
more
flexible
supply
terms
most
of
asia
s
lng
is
supplied
under
contracts
that
ensure
buyers
get
regular
supplies
through
fixed
monthly
cargoes
and
grant
producers
a
steady
stream
of
revenue
before
when
supplies
were
tight
buyers
were
willing
to
sign
up
to
terms
that
allowed
them
little
flexibility
on
price
and
volume
but
with
supplies
now
more
abundant
lng
buyers
are
demanding
changes
there
are
three
sticking
points
which
buyers
are
contesting
lng
buyers
receive
fixed
monthly
volumes
even
if
a
buyer
cancels
a
cargo
due
to
a
period
of
unusually
low
demand
payment
is
still
due
under
obligations
most
asian
supply
contracts
contain
destination
clauses
that
prevent
buyers
from
lng
to
third
parties
to
protect
buyers
and
sellers
from
sharp
price
swings
the
lng
under
most
contracts
is
indexed
to
oil
under
what
are
known
as
when
oil
prices
rise
quickly
the
grants
buyers
a
slope
once
oil
has
reached
a
level
under
which
the
price
for
lng
rises
more
slowly
and
with
a
sellers
of
lng
are
granted
a
similar
slope
which
slows
down
a
price
fall
in
oil
once
crude
has
fallen
to
a
certain
level
buyers
prefer
a
flat
slope
at
high
oil
prices
while
lng
producers
and
sellers
prefer
flat
slopes
at
low
oil
prices
in
most
existing
contracts
a
slope
of
around
percent
of
oil
prices
is
applied
under
a
time
lag
versus
crude
of
several
weeks
or
even
months
many
buyers
are
now
asking
for
a
lower
slope
of
percent
to
percent
at
current
prices
for
brent
crude
oil
of
around
per
barrel
a
reduction
of
the
slope
from
percent
to
percent
for
buyers
would
lead
to
a
fall
in
the
lng
price
of
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
to
per
mmbtu
many
lng
supply
contracts
span
years
some
even
decades
typically
a
window
for
review
is
allowed
at
defined
periods
should
no
agreement
be
reached
during
such
review
periods
the
contracts
include
the
possibility
of
going
into
arbitration
where
both
sides
agree
an
arbiter
to
resolve
the
dispute
without
involving
a
legal
court
between
and
european
utilities
entered
into
dozens
of
cases
against
producers
at
specialist
courts
in
paris
london
and
stockholm
mostly
winning
awards
in
their
favour
the
kogas
case
with
north
west
shelf
is
asia
s
first
lng
arbitration
to
become
public
the

arbitration
centre

lobbying
