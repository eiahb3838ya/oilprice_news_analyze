as
he
seeks

a

percent
short
of
analyst
estimates
as
the
group
was
hit
by
costs
including
paying
goldman
sachs
to
defend
against
activist
shareholder
white
tale
as
well
as
for
environmental

the
activists
sold
their
percent
stake
to
sabic
in
january
two
months
after
scuttling
clariant
s
bid
to
merge
with
huntsman
kottmann
wants
the
next
five
months
to
discuss
with
sabic
chief
yousef
how
their
arrangement
will
work
including
governance
issues
and
board
representation
while
stopping
short
of
labelling
sabic
a
white
knight
the
clariant
boss
was
clearly
pleased
with
white
tale
s
departure
it
depends
on
the
definition
of
a
white
i
consider
sabic
as
a
strategic
anchor
shareholder
which
will
allow
clariant
to
continue
in
its
current
structure
he
said
kottmann
said
he
expected
an
eventual
accord
with
sabic
to
include
restrictions
on
any
move
by
the
world
s
chemicals
group
to
take
control
of
clariant
my
colleague
yousef
is
a
very
reliable
and
credible
internationally
experienced
executive
he
has
clearly
stated
several
times
there
is
no
interest
in
sabic
taking
clariant
over
kottmann
told
a
news
conference
this
will
be
let
s
assume
it
part
of
the
he
added
sabic
was
awaiting
clearance
in
around
jurisdictions
for
its
clariant
stake
the
strategy
update
is
set
to
be
released
after
late
june
or
early
july
he
said
clariant
stock
slipped
percent
by
gmt
extending
a
fall
of
about
percent
since
late
january
when
sabic
said
it
was
becoming
clariant
s
largest
shareholder
analysts
say
the
decline
reflected
disappointment
that
sabic
would
not
seek
to
buy
clariant
outright
although
some
still
say
the
saudi
company
percent
owned
by
the
country
s
sovereign
wealth
fund
will
not
be
content
with
just
a
quarter
share
clariant
s
stock
took
a
hit
after
white
tale
sold
said
kepler
cheuvreux
analyst
christian
faitz
the
market
s
view
is
that
sabic
is
not
going
to
do
much
with
its
stake
while
we
believe
the
opposite
at
least
in
the
is
clariant
s
sales
rose
to
billion
swiss
francs
billion
in
line
with
the
average
estimate
in
a
reuters
poll
of
analysts
but
its
net
profit
after
minority
interests
rose
only
percent
to
million
francs
compared
with
an
average
estimate
of
million
in
addition
to
a
roughly
million
franc
hit
linked
to
tax
changes
clariant
had
million
francs
in
costs
compared
with
just
million
in
as
it
turned
to
goldman
to
help
defend
itself
against
white
tale
the
activist
led
by
new
york
city
real
estate
heir
david
winter
and
hedge
fund
investor
keith
meister
wanted
three
board
seats
and
a
strategic
review
by
investment
bankers
as
a
possible
precursor
to
a
of
clariant
chief
financial
officer
patrick
jany
said
the
failed
merger
with
huntsman
and
the
white

more
than
million
francs
on
top
of
million

clariant
said
it
would
raise
its
