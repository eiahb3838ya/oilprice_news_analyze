new

reuters
the
indian
government
s
plan
to
spend
million
over
two
years
to
prevent
crop
residue
burning
is
below
the
spending
estimates
of
its
policy
advisors
for
the
task
and
may
do
little
to
cut
the
air
pollution
that
envelops
the
capital
region
of
delhi
prime
minister
narendra
modi
s
cabinet
is
expected
to
sign
off
on
the
plan
as
early
as
this
month
three
senior
government
officials
involved
in
the
talks
told
reuters
the
planned
expenditure
is
far
less
than
the
million
per
year
that
niti
aayog
a
government
policy
advisory
group
estimated
last
november
needed
to
be
spent
to
prevent
farmers
from
burning
the
crop
waste
left
over
after
harvesting
it
was
not
clear
if
the
amount
was
recommended
to
the
government
crop
stubble
burning
caused
of
the
air
pollution
that
blanketed
delhi
in
november
the
ministry
of
environment
forest
and
climate
change
told
parliament
last
week
the
particles
from
the
stubble
burning
combine
with
industrial
pollution
vehicle
exhaust
and
dust
to
cover
the
region
every
year
as
winter
approaches
and
wind
speeds
drop
the
proposed
plan
would
give
money
to
farmers
in
three
states
bordering
delhi
punjab
haryana
and
uttar
pradesh
to
cover
percent
of
the
cost
of
machinery
to
remove
the
crop
stubble
said
the
officials
who
declined
to
be
named
ahead
of
cabinet
discussions
on
the
matter
this
would
keep
the
farmers
from
burning
the
residue
ahead
of
winter
planting
this
is
an
important
step
but
a
lot
will
depend
on
how
quickly
the
scheme
is
rolled
out
at
a
scale
that
can
make
a
difference
said
anumita
roychowdhury
executive
director
of
new
the
centre
for
science
and
environment
the
government
officials
said
the
funding
can
be
raised
if
needed
but
warned
against
expecting
immediate
results
we
won
t
be
able
to
improve
more
than
to
percent
of
air
quality
even
if
the
crop
residue
scheme
is
fully
implemented
acknowledged
one
of
the
government
officials
but
we
have
to
accept
that
the
efforts
to
clean
delhi
s
air
will
not
take
less
than
five
modi

delhi

pollution
index
climbed
to
times
higher
than
the
upper
limit
for
healthy

the
air
quality
in
central
delhi
on
wednesday
morning
remains
unhealthy
at
more
than
three
times
the
limit
according
to
the
united
states
embassy
in
new
delhi
delhi
was
dubbed
a
gas
chamber
by
its
chief
minister
and
the
federal
government
was
widely
criticized
after
united
airlines
suspended
flights
to
new

up
on
the
field
during
a
match
in
the
indian
capital
last
december
government
officials
have
vowed
to
reduce
the
pollution
a
strong
message
has
to
go
down
that
pollution
is
a
serious
economic
and
health
issue
and
it
is
linked
to
our
national
image

vardhan
said
at
the
launch
of
a
clean
air
campaign
last
week
we
mean
business
farmers
are
welcoming
the
plan
since
the
majority
of
them
can
not
afford
the
machinery
on
their
own
for
farmers
the
cost
of
most
agricultural
machineries
are
prohibitive
said
kartar
singh
a
farmer
from
punjab
and
that
s
why
the
subsidy
will
come
as
a
relief
to
those
