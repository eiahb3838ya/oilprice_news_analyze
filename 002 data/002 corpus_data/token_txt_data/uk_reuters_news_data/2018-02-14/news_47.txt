update 2-physical oil market sends warning to opec: rout might not be over
london
reuters
as
opec
watches
a
near
percent
drop
in
the
oil
price
in
three
weeks
important
indicators
in
the
physical
crude
market
are
flashing
signals
that
the
decline
might
be
far
from
over
the
warnings
come
not
from
the
heavily
traded
futures
market
but
from
less
transparent
trading
activity
in
crude
oil
and
products
markets
where
key
european
and
russian
crude
prices
have
fallen
of
late
suggesting
less
robust
demand
benchmark
oil
futures
have
plunged
in
recent
days
together
with
global
stock
markets
due
to
concerns
over
inflation
as
well
as
renewed
fears
that
rapid
output
increases
from
the
united
states
will
flood
the
market
with
more
crude
this
year
opec
including
its
mohammad
barkindo
argues
the
decline
is
just
a
blip
because
demand
is
exceeding
supply
and
that
prices
won
t
plunge
again
to
per
barrel
as
they
did
in
and
traditionally
when
oil
futures
decline
prices
in
the
physical
markets
tend
to
rise
because
crude
is
becoming
cheaper
and
hence
more
attractive
to
refiners
but
in
recent
weeks
differentials
in
key
european
and
markets
such
as
north
sea
forties
russia
s
urals
west
texas
intermediate
in
midland
texas
and
the
atlantic
diesel
market
have
fallen
to
lows
the
reasons
tend
to
be
different
for
most
physical
grades
but
overall
the
trend
paints
a
bearish
picture
physical
markets
do
not
lie
if
regional
areas
of
oversupply
can
not
find
pockets
of
demand
prices
will
decline
said
michael
tran
of
rbc
capital
markets
atlantic
basin
crudes
are
the
barometer
for
the
health
of
the
global
oil
market
since
the
region
is
the
first
to
reflect
looser
fundamentals
struggling
north
sea
physical
crudes
like
brent
forties
and
ekofisk
suggest
that
barrels
are
having
difficulty
finding
buyers
he
added
this
follows
a
in
production
to
million
barrels
per
day
as
of
november
the
highest
since
the
increase
pushed
the
united
states
into
second
place
among
crude
producers
ahead
of
saudi
arabia
and
trailing
only
russia
according
to
the
department
of
energy
on
tuesday
the
international
energy
agency
said
increased
supply
could
cause
output
to
exceed
demand
globally
in
forties
crude
differentials
to
dated
brent
have
fallen
to
minus
cents
from
a
premium
of
cents
at
the
start
of
the
year
as
the
forties
pipeline
returned
to
normal
operations
forties
differentials
are
now
not
far
off
their
lowest
since
when
the
benchmark
brent
crude
price
was
around
per
barrel
compared
to
now
and
a
few
weeks
ago
in
the
united
states
key
grades
traded
in
texas
and
louisiana
have
fallen
to
their
lowest
in
several
months
a
similar
pattern
can
be
observed
in
the
russian
urals
market
one
of
the
biggest
by
volume
in
europe
at
a
discount
of
to
dated
brent
urals
differentials
in
the
mediterranean
are
now
at
their
lowest
since
september
when
brent
futures
were
around
per
barrel
sour
grades
are
not
in
good
shape
worldwide
and
neither
are
urals
said
a
european
crude
oil
trader
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
as
he
is
forbidden
from
speaking
publicly
that
contrasts
with
the
start
of
when
opec
cuts
to
predominantly
sour
grades
made
them
attractive
to
buyers
supply
is
more
than
ample
in
europe
urals
face
strong
competition
from
the
middle
eastern
grades
said
another
trader
on
the
russian
crude
oil
market
adding
that
supplies
of
urals
to
asia
were
uneconomic
due
to
a
wide
spread
adding
pressure
on
urals
traders
expect
loadings
of
the
grade
to
rise
in
the
coming
months
due
to
seasonal
maintenance
at
russian
refineries
a
decline
in
physical
crude
values
generally
means
better
margins
for
refiners
but
it
is
also
not
happening
this
time
the
profit
margin
refiners
make
on
processing
crude
into
diesel
collapsed
in
europe
and
the
united
states
by
over
percent
in
the
past
week
according
to
reuters
data
europe
where
nearly
percent
of
vehicles
are
fueled
by
diesel
is
home
to
the
global
benchmark
for
diesel
prices
and
the
biggest
storage
hub
for
the
road
fuel
as
regional
refineries
are
unable
to
meet
local
demand
oil
demand
isn
t
that
bad
in
general
but
heating
oil
demand
has
been
horrible
particularly
in
the
united
states
and
germany
robert
campbell
head
of
global
oil
product
markets
at
consultancy
energy
aspects
said
european
refineries
are
running
at
very
high
rates
since
december
so
there
is
plenty
of
supply
in
the
region
while
the
weather
has
been
warmer
than
usual
which
led
to
weaker
the
refined
product
markets
were
expected
to
tighten
significantly
in
march
and
april
due
to
a
busy
schedule
for
seasonal
refinery
maintenance
but
in
a
further
indication
of
wavering
confidence
the
spread
between
the
april
gasoil
futures
to
the
may
contract
also
crashed
in
recent
weeks
from
an
high
premium
of
on
to
a
discount
of
cents
