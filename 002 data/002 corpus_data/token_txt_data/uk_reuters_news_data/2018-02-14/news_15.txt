reuters
bunge
ltd
is
exiting
the
global
sugar
trading
business
and
has
identified
a
few
interested
parties
in
the
business
as
it
moves
to
concentrate
on
its
grains
and
oilseeds
operations
the
company
s
chief
executive
said
on
wednesday
bunge
is
getting
out
of
sugar
trading
and
distribution
after
reporting
a
loss
which
increased
pressure
on
ceo
soren
schroder
to
improve
results
at
the
agricultural
merchant
that
has
received
takeover
approaches
from
archer
daniels
midland
co
and
glencore
plc
schroder
told
reuters
he
thinks
bunge
s
sugar
trading
business
should
have
value
to
other
industry
members
we
ve
got
a
few
interested
parties
so
that
will
be
our
first
path
of
action
he
said
in
an
interview
schroder
declined
to
name
the
interested
parties
bunge
is
a
major
player
in
the
global
sugar
industry
both
as
a
trader
and
as
a
producer
trading
was
historically
positive
for
the
company
citigroup
analyst
david
driscoll
said
on
a
bunge
conference
call
i
m
not
exactly
clear
why
you
d
really
want
to
shut
that
one
down
he
said
bunge
has
been
seeking
to
get
out
of
the
sugar
milling
business
in
brazil
since
as
a
supply
glut
has
pushed
prices
lower
and
made
it
tough
for
industry
participants
to
turn
a
profit
its
eight
brazilian
mills
can
produce
sugar
and
ethanol
and
have
a
capacity
of
more
than
million
tonnes
according
to
bunge
s
website
the
milling
business
will
have
its
own
direction
from
the
trading
business
schroder
told
reuters
bunge
has
struggled
to
generate
enough
gross
margin
to
cover
costs
in
sugar
schroder
said
on
the
conference
call
with
analysts
last
year
was
a
tough
year
for
traders
and
producers
with
raw
sugar
prices
tumbling
more
than
percent
we
simply
decided
that
it
was
time
to
really
focus
on
what
s
core
to
us
which
is
agribusiness
foods
grains
and
oilseeds
and
get
on
with
it
in
a
good
way
schroder
said
on
the
call
large
grain
traders
that
make
money
by
buying
selling
storing
and
shipping
crops
have
grappled
in
recent
years
with
global
oversupplies
thin
margins
have
squeezed
core
commodity
trading
operations
including
those
of
adm
bunge
cargill
inc
and
louis
dreyfus
co
which
dominate
the
grain
industry
and
are
known
as
the
abcds
because
of
their
initials
bunge
has
declined
to
comment
on
the
takeover
approach
from
adm
which
wound
down
its
global
sugar
trading
in
and
sold
a
brazilian
mill
a
few
years
ago
bunge
rebuffed
glencore
s
approach

year
