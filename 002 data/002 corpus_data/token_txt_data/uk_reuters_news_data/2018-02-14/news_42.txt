nigeria
reuters
the
court
of
appeal
in
london
ruled
on
wednesday
that
two
nigerian
communities
can
not
pursue
royal
dutch
shell
in
english
courts
over
oil
spills
in
nigeria
s
delta
region
the
split
decision
upheld
a
high
court
ruling
last
year
that
was
a
setback
to
attempts
to
hold
british
multinationals
liable
at
home
for
their
subsidiaries
actions
abroad
the
court
rejected
the
appeal
from
law
firm
leigh
day
on
behalf
of
nigeria
s
bille
and
ogale
communities
and
upheld
a
ruling
that
english
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
claims
against
shell
s
nigerian
subsidiary
shell
petroleum
development
company
spdc
spdc
is
jointly
operated
with
the
nigerian
government
shell
said
the
court
rightly
upheld
the
earlier
ruling
and
said
nigeria
s
justice
system
was
the
correct
place
for
the
claims
its
subsidiary
spdc
has
also
denied
responsibility
for
the
spills
which
it
says
were
due
to
sabotage
and
illegal
refining
one
of
the
three
senior
high
court
judges
the
rt
hon
lord
justice
sales
disagreed
with
the
majority
ruling
writing
that
the
communities
have
a
good
arguable
claim
that
shell
assumed
a
material
degree
of
responsibility
in
relation
to
the
management
of
the
pipeline
and
facilities
operated
by
spdc
leigh
day
said
the
two
nigerian
communities
intended
to
bring
the
case
to
britain
s
supreme
court
we
are
hopeful
that
the
supreme
court
will
grant
permission
to
appeal
and
will
come
to
a
different
view

okpabi
the
ruler
of
the
ogale
community
said
the
english
courts
were
the
only
hope
and
that
they
can
not
get
justice
in
nigeria
the
case
is
significant
in
determining
whether
multinational
companies
can
face
legal
action
in
england
over
their
subsidiaries
actions
abroad
last
year
an
appeals
court
upheld
a
ruling
that
a
case
brought
by
zambian
villagers
against
mining
company
vedanta
resources
over
environmental
pollution
could
be
heard
in
england
vedanta
said
it
would
seek
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
