parent
of
japan

steelmaker
plans
to
spend
more
than
billion
yen
billion
over
the
next
three
years
upgrading
domestic
production
facilities
in
a
bid
to
raise
productivity
and
competitiveness
a
key
goal
of
the
capital
expenditure
plans
outlined
by
jfe
holdings
president
eiji
hayashida
in
an
interview
on
wednesday
will
be
to
help
the
firm
meet
growing
demand
from
the
auto
industry
for
lighter
steel
and
new
materials
to
make
electric
and
other
cars
of
the
future
more
the
pivot
comes
as
asia
s
steelmakers
seek
to
make
the
most
of
demand
from
china
but
while
sales
in
the
world
s
economy
offer
hope
festering
tensions
on
global
trade
as
president
trump
ponders
tariffs
and
quotas
on
imports
of
steel
and
aluminium
are
becoming
a
major
headache
for
industry
executives
like
hayashida
we
ve
spent
a
bit
more
than
billion
yen
in
the
past
three
years
on
domestic
facilities
and
we
will
need
to
do
it
again
for
the
next
years
which
would
give
us
a
very
competitive
foundation
hayashida
told
reuters
we
may
even
increase
spending
he
said
with
japan
home
to
most
of
jfe
s
crude
steel
manufacturing
details
of
jfe
s
new
business
plan
through
march
will
be
announced
around
april
i
think
we
don
t
have
to
worry
about
china
economic
risk
at
least
this
year
hayashida
said
warning
he
sees
slower
chinese
demand
from
next
year
my
biggest
fear
is
how
far
president
trump
will
close
down
trade
the
executive
said
if
the
takes
action
to
curb
imports
it
may
trigger
retaliation
by
other
countries
what
is
most
troublesome
is
to
see
the
world
heading
to
japan
s
steelmakers
including
jfe
s
bigger
rival
nippon
steel
sumitomo
metal
corp
are
making
hefty
investment
in
ageing
domestic
plants
glitches
at
the
plants
some
more
than
years
old
have
prevented
them
from
manufacturing
as
much
steel
as
they
would
have
liked
as
well
as
more
modern
products
steel
has
dominated
car
material
usage
for
over
a
century
but
it
now
faces
fierce
competition
from
rivals
such
as
aluminium
and
carbon
fibre
reinforced
plastic
cfrp
as
automakers
turn
to
lighter
materials
to
make
more
cars
for
both
electric
vehicles
and
cars
demand
for
shedding
weight
will
only
get
stronger
hayashida
said
automakers
see
there
is
still
room
to
cut
the
weight
of
gasoline
car
by
percent
we
will
mainly
pour
resources
into
such
efforts
he
said
pointing
to
advanced
steel
and
new
components
to
be
created
through
cooperation
with
chemicals
manufacturers
jfe
said
in
december
that
it
and
a
unit
of
mitsubishi
chemical
holdings
have
jointly
developed
lightweight
car
door
panels
by
combining
steel
and
carbon
fibre
reinforced
plastic
cfrp
we
want
to
accelerate
similar
collaborations
with
multiple
partners
hayashida
said
outside
japan
hayashida
said
jfe
may
build
new
lines
at
its
automotive
steelmaking
plants
in
china
and
thailand
if
demand
picks
up
meanwhile
hayashida
said
there
were
no
plans
for
jfe
to
increase
its
percent
stake
in
indian
partner
jsw
steel
ltd
to
capitalise
on
potential
market
growth
in
india
i
don
t
see
any
benefit
from
raising
our
stake
from
the
current
percent
he
said
i
feel
comfortable
with
the
current
reporting
