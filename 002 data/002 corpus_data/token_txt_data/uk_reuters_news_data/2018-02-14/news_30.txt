analysis-higher wages, fuel prices turn up cost pressure on airlines

with
inflation
paramount
in
investors
minds
at
a
time
of
rising
wages
and
oil
prices
the
line
separating
winners
and
losers
in
the
global
airline
industry
this
year
looks
likely
to
be
drawn
on
how
well
they
manage
costs
especially
on
the
labor
side
industry
body
iata
in
december
flagged
higher
spending
on
labor
and
fuel
which
make
up
about
half
of
airlines
operating
expenses
as
their
members
biggest
challenge
in
especially
after
several
years
of
record
profits
labor
costs
surpassed
fuel
as
global
airlines
biggest
single
expense
in
at
percent
of
costs
against
just
under
percent
for
fuel
that
is
expected
to
jump
this
year
to
percent
versus
percent
for
fuel
back
in
when
oil
prices
were
much
higher
than
now
fuel
was
percent
of
expenses
against
percent
for
labor
staff
costs
are
typically
higher
in
north
america
and
europe
than
in
asia
where
fuel
remains
the
biggest
expense
the
crux
of
the
issue
is
that
amid
signs
of
a
global
shortage
of
workers
generally
in
some
regions
there
s
also
a
scarcity
of
qualified
pilots
at
a
time
of
expanding
fleets
as
airlines
have
been
making
profit
the
workforce
has
got
market
power
so
that
is
pushing
up
the
cost

of

of

carrier
ryanair
was
compelled
last
year
by
pilot
shortages
to
cancel
thousands
of
flights
and
in
december
recognized
trade
unions
for
the
first
time
the
battle
that
forced
ryanair

put

on

experts
say
the
bigger

feel
it
too
at

france
unions
representing
pilots
cabin
and
ground
staff
have
called
for
a
strike
on
to
push
a
demand
for
a
percent
pay
rise
after
three
years
of
strong
profitability
improvements
in
the
sector
we
believe
personnel
and
suppliers
are
asking
for
increases
and
thus
keeping
costs
under
control
will
remain
a
challenge
for
the
sector

from

cut
its
rating
on
german
flagship
carrier
lufthansa
already
on
its
lists
of
stocks
to
avoid
and
least
preferred
in
the
sector
to
reduce
from
hold
in
the
united
states
investors
are
worried
that
the
three
largest
carriers
american
delta
and
united
are
heading
for
a
price
war
just
as
higher
costs
from

increases
agreed
last
year
start
to
bite
lufthansa
british
airways
parent
iag
and
air
are
all
expected
to
report
improved
profits
when
they
publish
results
over
the
next
few
weeks
all
airlines
will
need
to
look
at
areas
where
they
can
save
however
the
most
successful
airline
managements
are
the
ones
that
have
been
very
every
day
not
just
on
staff
costs
but
on
aircraft
costs
airport
charges
distribution
costs
and
so
on
said
aviation
consultant
john
strickland
the
success
of
ryanair
which
boasts
of
having
the
lowest
costs
in
europe
is
partly
down
to
hard
negotiating
with
manufacturers
and
airports
to
get
good
deals
on
orders
and
fees
those
in
the
industry
say
strickland
said
that
while
pilot
costs
would
rise
ryanair
was
unique
in
having
much
lower
overall
costs
than
rivals
if
they
can
continue
to
keep
other
items
such
as
airport
and
aircraft
costs
down
then
they
will
still
be
in
a
very
strong
lufthansa
has
been
taking
a
tougher
stance
lately
both
with
staff
and
airports
unlike
in
previous
negotiations
for
its
main
brand
in
germany
lufthansa
stayed
firm
during
a
series
of
pilot
strikes
from
to
and
has
now
struck
a
deal
to
cut
its
cockpit
staff
costs
by
percent
while
an
increase
in
ground
staff
s
wages
will
be
partly
linked
to
company
profits
last
year
it
also
put
pressure
on
frankfurt
airport
operator
fraport
by
moving
planes
to
munich
it
predicts
unit
costs
will
fall
by
percent
this
year
analysts
at
barclays
say
while
such
measures
should
help
lufthansa
the
rate
of
improvement
is
not
sustainable
and
progress
still
needs
to
be
made
at
budget
unit
eurowings
which
earns
less
than
half
the
margin
of
its
nearest
peer
there
is
a
significant
amount
more
work
for
the
company
to
do
on
its
cost
base
they
wrote
in
a
note
along
with
strong
travel
demand
thanks
to
robust
economies
and
low
oil
prices
last
year
european
airlines
have
also
benefited
from
some
consolidation
following
the
insolvencies
of
air
berlin
and
monarch
which
helped
lead
to
higher
ticket
prices
in
addition
many
european
carriers
hedged
on
jet
fuel
unlike
their
counterparts
who
got
burned
making
the
wrong
bets
when
the
oil
price
starting
tumbling
in
meaning
the
impact
of
higher
fuel
prices
will
come
through
for
european
airlines
later
than
ones
easyjet
s
revenue
per
seat
rose
percent
at
constant
currencies
in
the
quarter
to
the
airline
said
citing
the
struggles
of
rivals
including
air
berlin
monarch
ryanair
and
alitalia
it
forecast
a
rise
of
percent
for
the
six
months
to
march
airlines
need
to
be
careful
they
don
t
lock
themselves
into
cost
structures
that
are
too
high
for
weaker
economic
conditions
iata
s
pearce
warned
at
the
moment
they
re
not
doing
that
but
it
