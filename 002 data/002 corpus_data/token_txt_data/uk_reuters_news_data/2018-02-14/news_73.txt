billion

to
raise

to
take
control
of
and
develop
a
gas
field
off
the
country

west
coast
woodside
said
on
wednesday
it
had
agreed
to
pay
million
for
exxonmobil
corp
s
stake
in
the
scarborough
field
a
project
that
has
been
stuck
on
the
drawing
board
for
nearly
years
due
to
factors
including
its
remote
deepwater
location
the
company
said
that
soaring
international
demand
for
gas
meant
the
time
was
right
for
the
acquisition
with
the
field
expected
to
feed
an
expansion
of
its
pluto
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
plant
in
the
state
of
western
australia
the
difference
between
supply
and
demand
is
opening
up
very
very
quickly
said
woodside
chief
executive
peter
coleman
adding
that
chinese
appetite
for
lng
was
growing
rapidly
but
some
analysts
underscored
the
challenges
of
developing
the
field
with
ben
wilson
at
royal
bank
of
canada
describing
the
site
in
a
broker
note
as
deep
distant
dirty
and
dry
the
move
puts
woodside
seen
as
short
on
growth
prospects
in
control
of
scarborough
with
a
stake
working
with
bhp
billiton
on
a
project
now
estimated
to
cost
up
to
billion
the
rest
of
the
money
raised
through
the
a
billion
offer
to
existing
shareholders
will
be
used
to
support
work
on
scarborough
the
browse
lng
project
in
australia
and
the

development
off
senegal
analysts
said
that
even
with
the
large
equity
raising
woodside
may
have
to
come
back
to
investors
in
a
few
years
to
fund
the
development
of
scarborough
and
browse
woodside
has
a
market
value
of
a

there
s
a
lot
of
money
to
pay

an
rise
in

part
of
the
