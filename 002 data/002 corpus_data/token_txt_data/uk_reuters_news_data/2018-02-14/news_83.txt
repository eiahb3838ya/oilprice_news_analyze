when
malaysia
s
biggest
plantation
company
sime
darby
leased
hectares
of
lush
forest
in
northwest
liberia
in
executives
said
they
had
found
a
much
needed
new
frontier
in
global
palm
oil
development
undulating
hills
a
tropical
climate
and
plenty
of
untouched
land
made
the
west
african
country
s
interior
ideal
for
palm
oil
growers
running
out
of
room
in
southeast
asia
nine
years
later
however
sime
darby
plantation
has
planted
only
hectares
in
liberia
and
has
not
laid
a
seed
in
two
years
stalled
by
uncertainties
over
new
environmental
standards
we
are
losing
money
we
have
to
balance
our
books
or
there
is
no
future
said
david
parker
the
head
of
sime
darby
plantations
in
liberia
in
its
earnings
report
for
the
financial
year
ending
in
june
sime
darby
said
it
had
filed
a
million
ringgit
million
impairment
a
permanent
reduction
in
the
value
of
the
asset
on
its
liberia
operations
the
operations
were
affected
by
a
number
of
factors
including
the
ebola
outbreak
and
more
stringent
environmental
plans
that
have
stalled
expansion
since
it
said
the
billion
palm
oil
industry
is
considering
whether
to
adopt
new
no
deforestation
rules
for
an
oil
found
on
supermarket
shelves
across
the
world
from
cooking
oil
to
snack
food
and
soups
to
soaps
the
rules
mark
a
more
environmentally
friendly
form
of
palm
oil
development
but
leave
producers
with
a
major
conundrum
how
to
meet
growing
demand
and
make
money
with
so
much
land
now
potentially
off
limits
the
debate
is
unfolding
at
the
roundtable
on
sustainable
palm
oil
rspo
an
industry
watchdog
that
consists
of
planters
companies
and
ngos
while
awaiting
those
rules
sime
darby
has
stopped
planting
palm
in
liberia
parker
said
olam
international
in
gabon
has
also
paused
development
on
all
but
grassland
areas
until
the
rules
are
published
said
ranveer
chauhan
its
managing
director
of
edible
oils
but
back
at
corporate
headquarters
in
kuala
lumpur
sime
says
it
is
trying
out
a
new
method
using
satellite
data
to
measure
a
forest
s
carbon
content
so
it
can
tell
exactly
how
much
land
it
can
and
can
not
develop
a
new
plan
for
land
development
in
liberia
is
currently
being
prepared
following
the
completion
of
these
trials
sime
s
chief
sustainability
officer
simon
lord
told
reuters
darrel
webber
chief
executive
officer
at
the
rspo
secretariat
in
malaysia
said
he
can
not
comment
with
the
review
under
way
and
no
conclusive
decisions
on
the
changes
have
been
made
yet
the
rules
are
expected
to
come
to
a
vote
at
rspo
s
annual
meeting
in
november
concerns
about
the
amount
of
forests
and
peatlands
cleared
for
plantations
and
the
greenhouse
gases
that
are
then
emitted
into
the
atmosphere
have
plagued
the
palm
oil
industry
for
years
over
the
past
decade
consumer
activist
groups
have
pressed
big
palm
oil
buyers
such
as
pepsico
unilever
and
nestle
with
supermarket
boycotts
and
other
protests
over
palm
oil
s
perceived
links
to
climate
change
many
companies
are
willing
to
pay
a
premium
price
for
palm
oil
labelled
with
a
valued
rspo
sustainability
certificate
the
new
rules
will
decide
if
land
can
be
cleared
for
palm
based
on
its
carbon
content
a
dense
forest
might
hold
up
to
tonnes
of
carbon
per
hectare
grassland
about
tonnes
if
the
rspo
decides
an
area
holding
above
tonnes
an
hectare
is
off
limits
then
sime
darby
may
be
unable
to
develop
most
of
its
liberia
concession
said
ahmad
rifqi
sime
darby
s
manager
of
plantation
sustainability
in
liberia
almost
all
here
is
over
tonnes
per
hectare
the
only
areas
are
farmlands
already
cultivated
by
local
communities
he
said
sime
darby
boasts
of
being
the
world
s
biggest
producer
of
sustainable
palm
oil
it
has
an
online
dashboard
displaying
information
about
its
supply
chain
and
compliance
with
rspo
rules
it
s
land
bank
of
nearly
hectares
an
area
larger
than
puerto
rico
makes
it
the
world
s
largest
palm
plantation
firm
by
land
size
the
liberia
concessions
account
for
over
a
fifth
of
that
with
governments
and
companies
under
increasing
pressure
to
adhere
to
higher
deforestation
standards
greenfield
expansions
in
southeast
asia
have
become
uncommon
says
ivy
ng
regional
head
of
plantations
research
at
cimb
investment
bank
in
kuala
lumpur
in
recent
years
company
expansion
is
largely
via
buying
stakes
of
other
companies
ng
said
sime
darby
s
only
major
expansion
in
southeast
asia
since
its
merger
with
two
other
large
plantation
firms
has
been
its
acquisition
of
new
britain
palm
oil
in
papua
new
guinea
in
oil
palm
originated
in
west
africa
and
was
used
there
for
thousands
of
years
and
with
global
demand
growing
by
an
average
percent
a
year
growers
had
looked
to
africa
to
expand
yet
production
in
africa
has
grown
by
less
than
percent
since
compared
to
around
percent
for
southeast
asia
and
globally
latin
america
is
now
the

two

low

be
seen
trailing
to
the
horizon
a
duller
green
than
the
natural
forest
canopy
that
towers
above
the
concession
s
edge
the
serene
view
belies
a
cascade
of
troubles
local
residents
who
claimed
sime
had
encroached
on
community
ands
set
up
roadblocks
to
halt
workers
and
stole
keys
from
bulldozers
community
leaders
and
workers
told
reuters
sime
says
the
land
came
from
a
government
concession
but
to
appease
residents
it
built
schools
and
offers
free
medical
services
to
workers
and
their
families
its
own
ambitions
meanwhile
have
shrunk
a
new
mill
that
doesn
t
have
enough
fruit
to
press
into
oil
to
run
at
full
capacity
and
crop
theft
by
local
residents
costs
the
company
about
percent
of
its
harvest
in
some
areas
parker
said
sime
hopes
to
plant
another
hectares
once
it
can
show
the
first
are
profitable
parker
said
sime
darby
is
committed
to
the
long
term
if
we
can
make
a
profit
