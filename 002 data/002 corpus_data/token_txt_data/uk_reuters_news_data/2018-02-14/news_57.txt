oecd says energy taxes in developed economies too low to fight climate change

energy
taxes
in
major
advanced
economies
are
not
doing
enough
to
reduce
energy
use
improve
energy
efficiency
and
drive
a
shift
towards
sources
the
organisation
for
economic
and
development
oecd
said
on
wednesday
taxes
on
energy
use
such
as
fuel
carbon
taxes
and
excise
duties
are
used
by
many
governments
to
make
energy
consumers
pay
for
the
costs
of
pollution
thereby
reducing
harmful
greenhouse
gas
emissions
which
lead
to
global
warming
the
oecd
examined
taxes
on
energy
use
between
and
in
oecd
and
economies
which
represent
around
percent
of
global
energy
use
and
carbon
emissions
from
energy
use
the
study
did
not
include
carbon
market
prices
such
as
in
the
eu
s
emissions
trading
system
but
the
oecd
said
they
do
little
to
change
the
report
s
findings
the
oecd
found
that
almost
all
taxes
are
too
low
to
help
combat
global
warming
compared
to
a
benchmark
level
of
euros
per
tonne
of
carbon
dioxide
a
conservative
minimum
estimate
of
the
damage
from
emitting
one
tonne
of
a
bird
s
eye
view
of
effective
taxes
per
tonne
of
across
all
countries
reveals
that
there
is
hardly
any
change
in
the
tax
rates
on
emissions
outside
the
road
transport
sector
the
report
said
taxes
continue
to
be
poorly
aligned
with
environmental
and
climate
costs
of
energy
use
across
all
countries
it
added
in
the
road
transport
sector
percent
of
emissions
are
taxed
and
rates
were
above
for
percent
of
emissions
in
compared
to
percent
in
in
sectors
which
collectively
account
for
percent
of
carbon
emissions
from
energy
use
percent
of
emissions
were
untaxed
and
rates
were
below
for
percent
of
emissions
coal
which
accounts
for
almost
half
of
carbon
emissions
in
the
countries
goes
untaxed
in
many
countries
and
was
taxed
above
in
just
five
countries
examined
taxes
on
oil
products
were
relatively
high
at
over
on
average
across
all
sectors
and
particularly
high
in
road
transport
a
sector
which
remains
almost
entirely
dependent
on
oil
products
taxes
on
diesel
for
transport
use
are
lower
than
taxes
for
gasoline
in
every
country
except
two
although
this
pattern
appears
to
be
changing
the
report
said
some
governments
have
started
to
raise
diesel
fuel
taxes
amid
pressure
to
improve
air
quality
in
major
cities
apart
from
transport
fuel
tax
increases
in
some
large
income
economies
and
some
first
steps
towards
aligning
diesel
taxes
with
gasoline
taxes
there
is
no
structural
change
to
the
pattern
of
taxes
on
energy
use
between
and
