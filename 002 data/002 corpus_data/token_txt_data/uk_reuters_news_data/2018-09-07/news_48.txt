kenya
s
economic
growth
momentum
for
this
year
could
be
snuffed
out
if
a
widely
unpopular
percent
value
added
tax
on
fuel
is
maintained
the
country
s
chamber
of
commerce
said
on
friday
pointing
at
higher
prices
of
goods
and
transport
the
tax
which
came
into
force
on
is
part
of
a
government
bid
to
boost
revenue
collection
in
order
to
narrow
its
fiscal
deficit
and
secure
an
extension
of
a
standby
credit
facility
from
the
international
monetary
fund
the
high
court
on
thursday
ordered
a
temporary
suspension
of
the
tax
but
prices
at
petrol
stations
visited
by
reuters
on
friday
had
not
come
back
down
we
are
asking
the
government
to
its
options
for
financing
its
development
and
recurrent
expenditure
instead
of
overtaxing
various
products
that
already
bear
large
tax
burdens
the
kenya
national
chamber
of
commerce
and
industry
kncci
said
in
a
statement
the
treasury
could
not
immediately
be
reached
for
comment
the
finance
ministry
expects
economic
growth
to
rebound
to
percent
this
year
after
drought
jitters
over
a
presidential
election
and
sluggish
private
sector
credit
growth
cut
last
year
s
growth
to
percent
the
recent
resurgence
of
the
economy
will
be
negatively
impacted
by
this
move
and
this
will
reverse
any
growth
we
have
seen
in
the
past
year
kncci
said
the
new
vat
on
fuel
sent
the
retail
price
of
petrol
up
by
percent
per
litre
transport
operators
have
also
raised
their
charges
and
some
petrol
dealers
have
gone
on
strike
to
protest
against
the
new
tax
causing
fuel
shortages
the
tax
was
originally
included
in
a
law
passed
in
but
was
postponed
several
times
amid
protests
about
its
impact
the
revenue
authority
introduced
the
tax
on
saturday
but
president
uhuru
kenyatta
could
still
reverse
it
by
signing
a
bill
postponing
it
again
justin
muturi
the
speaker
of
the
national
assembly
told
reuters
on
friday
the
legislature
was
consulting
with
the
finance
ministry
to
find
a
way
forward
on
the
tax
kenyan
businesses
and
ordinary
people
routinely
complain
of
a
heavy
tax
burden
the
chamber
of
commerce
said
the
government
could
widen
the
tax
base
and
increase
the
rate
of
tax
compliance
to
percent
from
the
current
percent
it
also
urged
the
government
to
cut
expenditure
reduce
wastage
of
public
funds
and
deal
with
corruption
which
some
past
studies
have
found
account
for
the
loss
of
up
to
a
third
of
the
government
s
annual
budget
