concludes
that
it
was
suicide
the
head
of
ethiopia
s
federal
police
commission
zeinu
jemal
told
reporters
forensic
examinations
matched
gunshot
residue
to
a
gun
he
had
owned
for
a
decade
he
added
zeinu
said
the
investigation
had
shown
that
the
victim
had
been
under
pressure
from
delays
in
the
construction
of
the
dam
and
that
conversations
with
his
secretary
an
hour
before
his
death
and
with
his
children
the
evening
before
seemed
like
farewell
statements
ethiopia
has
been
pushing
on
with
the
project
in
the
face
of
opposition
from
egypt
which
fears
the
dam
will
affect
the
flow
of
the
nile
its
main
source
of
water
in
june
the
leaders
of
ethiopia
and
egypt
vowed
to
iron
out
their
differences
peacefully
the
government
has
only
acknowledged
recently
that
the
dam
begun
in
and
originally
expected
to
be
completed
this
year
might
take
another
years
to
finish
last
month
prime
minister
abiy
ahmed
said
the
government
had
terminated
the
contract
of
the
metals
and
engineering
corporation
metec
the
contractor
for
the
project
s
electromechanical
and
hydraulic

salini
impregilo
remains
the
main
contractor
building
the
dam
which
is
designed
to
churn
out
megawatts
mw
of
power
on
completion
zeinu
said
the
preliminary
indications
were
that
simegnew
s
suicide
was
linked
not
only
to
the
delays
but
also
to
the
extra
costs
they
were
incurring
for
the
government
all
this
added
up
to
pile
pressure
