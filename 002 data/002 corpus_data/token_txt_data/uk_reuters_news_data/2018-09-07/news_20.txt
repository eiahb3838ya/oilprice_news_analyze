reuters
chevron
corp
said
on
friday
an
international
tribunal
ruled
in
its
favor
in
an
environmental
dispute
with
ecuador
finding
the
south
american
nation
had
violated
its
obligations
under
international
treaties
the
tribunal
unanimously
held
that
a
billion
pollution
judgment
by
ecuador
s
supreme
court
against
chevron
was
procured
through
fraud
bribery
and
corruption
and
was
based
on
claims
that
had
been
already
settled
and
released
by
the
republic
of
ecuador
years
the
decision
adds
to
several
court
victories
that
chevron
has
won
against
the
plaintiffs
and
its
legal
team
in
the
case
texaco
which
chevron
acquired
in
was
released
from
liability
through
a
settlement
with
ecuador
years
earlier
the
tribunal
found
ecuador
plans
to
appeal
the
tribunal
s
ruling

the
decision
in
part
on
its
findings
of
judicial
fraud
in
the
case
inigo
salvador
ecuador
s
attorney
general
said
at
a
news
conference
on
friday
it
worries
us
that
the
tribunal
is
asking
a
country
to
lift
a
sentence
of
one
of
its
courts
that
was
issued
as
part
of
a
dispute
between
private
parties
said
salvador
the
tribunal
administered
by
the
permanent
court
of
arbitration
in
the
hague
will
next
conduct
a
trial
to
determine
the
damages
suffered
by
chevron
a
process
that
could
take
months
chevron
estimated
its
damages
and
legal
costs
would
run
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
said
spokesman
sean
comey
ecuador
had
multiple
opportunities
to
put
an
end
to
this
liability
said
comey
who
said
a
failure
to
now
accept
the
decision
will
continue
to
accrue
further
