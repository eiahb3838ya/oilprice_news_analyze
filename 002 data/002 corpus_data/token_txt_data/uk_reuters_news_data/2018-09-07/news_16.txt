scotland
s
leader
nicola
sturgeon
launched
on
friday
a
major
renewable
energy
project
boasting
the
world
s
most
powerful
wind
turbines
which
she
hopes
will
also
propel
the
independence
ambitions
of
her
nationalist
party
the
turbines
in
the
waters
of
aberdeen
bay
will
eventually
produce
gwh
of
power
a
year
enough
to
power
households
helping
to
reduce
scotland
s
reliance
on
its
oil
industry
scotland
is
a
world
leader
in
energy
and
that
is
good
for
our
present
and
our
future
whatever
that
may
be
sturgeon
told
reuters
standing
on
a
ferry
underneath
the
churning
blades
of
the
new
european
offshore
wind
deployment
centre
eowdc
which
is
run
by
swedish
utility
vattenfall
the
scottish
national
party
she
leads
which
is
seeking
to
maintain
its
drive
for
independence
from
the
united
kingdom
has
embraced
renewable
power
as
the
centre
of
its
energy
policy
the
party
s
emphasis
on
future
oil
revenues
was
seen
by
many
as
a
key
weakness
in
the
failed
campaign
to
win
an
independence
referendum
in
an
snp
strategy
published
this
year
removed
oil
from
the
party
s
baseline
plans
for
the
economy
describing
it
instead
as
a
bonus
while
renewables
were
seen
as
one
of
scotland
s
economic
motors
with
food
and
drink
and
finance
at
the
same
time
renewable
projects
such
as
eodcw
enhance
the
snp
s
appeal
to
the
percent
of
scottish
voters
who
think
climate
change
is
an
urgent
concern
according
to
a
survey
of
households
published
by
the
scottish
government
this
week
sturgeon
wants
percent
of
all
of
scotland
s
energy
to
come
from
renewables
by
compared
with
an
eu
target
of
at
least
percent
scotland
s
energy
minister
paul
wheelhouse
said
the
renewable
power
and
low
carbon
sector
provided
jobs
in
scotland
compared
with
in
oil
and
gas
but
the
difference
was
narrowing
with
scots
unhappy
about
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
another
referendum
for
scottish
independence
is
a
possibility
which
sturgeon
does
not
rule
out
the
eu
s
financial
support
for
renewable
projects
such
as
the
eowdc
has
underpinned
support
for
the
bloc
scotland
has
the
majority
of
the
uk
s
onshore
wind
energy
resources
and
the
seas
around
scotland
have
up
to
percent
of
europe
s
tidal
power
percent
of
its
wave
power
and
around
percent
of
european
offshore
wind
resource
potential
even
so
the
value
of
the
oil
still
under
the
north
sea
has
defied
predictions
of
a
quick
collapse
and
still
dominates
scotland
s
economy
for
now
especially
with
the
recent
recovery
in
the
oil
price
at
the
same
time
more
efficient
techniques
for
dismantling
old
oil
rigs
in
deep
and
often
treacherous
waters
is
a
skill
that
scotland
is
pioneering
as
another
revenue
earner
not
everyone
is
a
fan
of
the
new
wind
power
project
in
aberdeen
bay
before
he
was
elected
as
president
donald
trump
objected
to
the
wind
farm
being
located
in
full
view
of
his
golf
course
at
balmedie
he
was
defeated
in
a
court
battle
maybe
on
his
next
trip
to
scotland
he
can
come
and
see
it
and
change
his
mind
