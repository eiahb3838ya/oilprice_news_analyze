emerging

badly

nerves
were
set
to
be
frayed
further
as
the
public
comment
period
for
proposed
tariffs
on
an
additional

worth
of
chinese
imports
ends
at
gmt
the
tariffs
could
go
into

shortly
afterward

there
was
no
clear
timetable
china
has
warned
of
retaliation
if
washington
launches
any
new
measures
it
seems
unlikely
the

are
not
implemented

the

that
they
are
winning
the

will
be
in

jpmorgan

analysts
at

markets
cautioned
that
despite
employment
indicators
pointing
to
another
strong
report
it
is
worth
noting
that
there
is
a
tendency
for

payrolls
to
initially
disappoint
and
then
be
revised
up
