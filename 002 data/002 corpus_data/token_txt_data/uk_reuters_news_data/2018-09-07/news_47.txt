preview-vw faces 9.2 bln euros investor suit over dieselgate scandal
frankfurt
reuters
volkswagen
faces
a
trial
next
week
as
investors
seek
billion
euros
billion
in
compensation
arguing
that
the
carmaker
should
have
informed
shareholders
about
a
diesel
pollution
scandal
before
regulators
did
in
september
the
lawsuit
bundles
claims
brought
mainly
by
vw
s
institutional
shareholders
who
have
accused
the
carmaker
of
failing
to
inform
investors
about
the
scope
of
a
scandal
which
has
cost
the
company
billion
euros
in
penalties
and
fines
had
vw
warned
investors
about
the
size
of
the
scandal
before
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
issued
a
notice
of
violation
on
then
institutional
investors
may
have
avoided
losses
on
their
shareholdings
plaintiffs
said
vw
shares
lost
up
to
percent
of
their
value
in
the
days
after
authorities
exposed
illegal
levels
of
pollution
emitted
from
vw
diesel
cars
volkswagen
has
admitted
systematic
emissions
cheating
but
denies
wrongdoing
in
matters
of
regulatory
disclosure
presiding
judge
christian
jaede
at
the
braunschweig
higher
regional
court
will
make
opening
remarks
at
the
trial
on
monday
vw
insists
that
the
epa
s
issuance
of
the
notice
of
violation
was
not
in
keeping
with
how
authorities
had
handled
similar
cases
involving
other
carmakers
because
other
carmakers
had
reached
a
settlement
for
emissions
cheating
without
an
epa
notice
of
violation
and
because
vw
was
in
talks
about
reaching
a
settlement
vw
s
board
did
not
see
the
need
to
inform
investors
the
carmaker
said
in
a
filing
with
the
braunschweig
court
vw
had
already
made
substantial
provisions
in
late
to
cover
other
vehicle
recalls
and
because
previous
fines
by
authorities
for
similar
violations
were
below
million
there
was
no
need
to
issue
an
disclosure
notice
under
german
law
the
carmaker
said
in
the
filing
volkswagen
says
board
members
at
the
time
including
volkswagen
s
current
chief
executive
herbert
diess
and
chairman
hans
dieter
poetsch
therefore
did
not
violate
disclosure
rules
according
to
the
vw
defense
document
filed
with
the
court
neither
the
management
board
nor
individual
board
members
caused
or
were
involved
with
the
compliance
violation
in
the
united
states
vw
s
court
filing
said
however
plaintiffs
including
lawyer
andreas
tilp
from
law
firm
tilp
and
fund
management
firm
deka
argue
that
managers
below
management
board
level
including
divisional
heads
knew
about
deliberate
and
systematic
emissions
cheating
the
company
as
such
was
therefore
aware
of
severe
criminal
activity
and
investors
should
therefore
have
been
warned
earlier

plaintiffs
