a
major
canadian
oil
producer
has
signed
a
deal
to
move
more
crude
with
the
canadian
national
railway
co
a
source
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
matter
told
reuters
the
deal
is
one
of
many
being
quietly
signed
that
along
with
the
expedited
deliveries
of
new
locomotives
will
help
boost
canada
s
shipments
percent
by
year
end
a
government
consultant
told
reuters
separately
the
source
said
the
deal
was
inked
days
before
a
canadian
court
last
week
overturned
the
approval
of
the
trans
mountain
oil
pipeline
expansion
shipper
commitments
put
cn
and
smaller
rival
canadian
pacific
railway
ltd
in
position
to
collectively
move
more
than
barrels
per
day
by
december
said
greg
stringham
a
consultant
who
mediated
talks
among
oil
producers
and
railways
for
the
alberta
government
this
year
stringham
did
not
directly
address
the
cenovus
deal
but
said
new
contracts
are
being
signed
not
all
of
those
been
disclosed
yet
but
it
is
the
railways
burned
a
few
years
ago
when
booming
demand
for
vanished
as
oil
prices
fell
and
pipeline
space
opened
are
now
seeking
rich
deals
from
producers
the
bpd
would
be
percent
higher
than
june
s
record
bpd
and
double
bpd
achieved
in
december
it
is
expected
to
further
increase
in
as
locomotive
orders
start
to
catch
up
with
demand
the
two
railways
and
cenovus
declined
to
comment
the
source
declined
to
be
identified
as
the
deal
is
not
public
cenovus
ceo
alex
pourbaix
said
in
july
that
he
was
considering
a
commitment
to
move
to
bpd
by
rail
cenovus
shares
rebounded
to
trade
up
as
much
as
percent
soon
after
the
news
earlier
in
the
day
they
had
fallen
percent
after
goldman
sachs
downgraded
the
stock
to
sell
cn
shares
were
down
percent
increased
crude
shipping
by
rail
while
still
far
short
of
western
canada
s
capacity
of
nearly
million
bpd
would
represent
progress
in
moving
more
canadian
oil
to
refineries
it
remains
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
total
million
bpd
on
average
exported
mostly
to
the
in
but
as
crude
shipments
increase
so
do
safety
concerns
in
a
runaway
train
carrying
crude
exploded
in
the
quebec
town
of
lac
megantic
killing
people
in
june
some
gallons
of
crude
spilled
into
an
iowa
river
after
a
train
derailed
the
head
of
canada
s
transportation
regulator
said
last
month
that
stronger
tank
cars
for
transporting
flammable
liquids
should
be
required
sooner
than
a
deadline
enbridge
inc
s
oversubscribed
mainline
pipeline
rations
space
each
month
as
oil
producers
expand
production
driving
a
bigger
discount
in
western
canada
s
heavy
crude
compared
to
the
north
american
benchmark
the
increased
crude
by
rail
volumes
could
not
happen
without
new
locomotives
that
the
railways
are
placing
into
service
faster
than
before
probably
the
biggest
constraint
that
was
identified
was
the
lack
of
locomotives
being
available
said
stringham
adding
that
the
railways
went
to
their
suppliers
and
were
able
to
cut
delivery
times
from
months
down
to
nine
to
months
cn
said
on
wednesday
that
it
had
ordered
an
extra
locomotives
from
general
electric
co
adding
to
a
previous
deal
for
locomotives
over
three
years
the
original
order
will
now
be
completed
in
two
years
and
the
additional
are
due
in
cn
spokesman
patrick
waldron
said
those
locomotives
will
be
used
for
energy
transport
along
with
intermodal
coal
and
agricultural
products
western
canada
s
crude
inventories
reached
million
barrels
for
the
week
ending
a
record
level
since
genscape
began
monitoring
in
as
oil
production
expands
faster
than
transport
capacity
