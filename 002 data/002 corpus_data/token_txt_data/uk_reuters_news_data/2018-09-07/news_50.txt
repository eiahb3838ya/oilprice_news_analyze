world
shares
limped
toward
their
worst
week
in
almost
six
months
on
friday
with
asia
carving
out
a
trough
as
investors
braced
for
a
new
salvo
of
tariffs
a
slump
in
chip
stocks
and
reports
that
president
donald
trump
had
also
weighed
a
trade
scrap
with
japan
dragged
on

overnight
while

a

since

emerging

have
lost
even
more
some

nerves
were
set
to
be
frayed
further
after
the
public
comment
period
for
proposed
tariffs
on
an
additional
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
passed
at
gmt
the
tariffs
could
now
go
into
effect
at
any
moment
although
there
was
no
clear
timetable
china
has
warned
of
retaliation
if
washington
launches
any

australia

in
as
play
on
china
s
fortunes
due
to
its
huge

exports
there
hit
a
year
low
early
on
it
europe
it
is
all
linked
to
the
trade
comment
period
expiring
and
now
we
are
wondering
what
the
implementation
plan
is
going
to
be
and
how
china
is
going
to
respond

is

as

there
were
some
crumbs
of
comfort
however
for
traders
battered
emerging
market
shares
were
on
course
to
snap
a
losing
streak
china
had
closed

overnight

the
tariff

msci

still

by
a

and
reports
president
donald

could
be
contemplating
taking

over

other
emerging
markets
were
trying
to
steady
after
a
punishing
week
with
indonesia
and
the
philippines
still
badly
scarred
by
fears
of
capital
flight
following
crises
in
argentina
and
turkey
and
the
rumbling
trade
strains
it
seems
unlikely
the
tariffs
are
not
implemented
as
the
administration
believes
that
they
are
winning
the
trade
war
and
will
be
in
a
stronger
position
to
negotiate
if
they
put
more
pressure
on
china
jpmorgan
analysts
wrote
in
a
note
the
tech
sector
was
also
very
weak
overnight
with
a
slide
in
micron
of
almost
percent

further
weakness
in

were
also
turning

month
still
analysts
at
natwest
markets
cautioned
that
despite
employment
indicators
pointing
to
another
strong
report
it
is
worth
noting
that
there
is
a
tendency
for
august
payrolls
to
initially
disappoint
and
then
be
revised
up
noticeably
just
as
important
will
be
