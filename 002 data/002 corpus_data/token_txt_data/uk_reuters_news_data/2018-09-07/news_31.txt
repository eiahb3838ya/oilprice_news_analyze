to
be
their
single
greatest
threat
urging
washington
to
return
to
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
just
as
western
powers
seek
to
check
china
s
rising
influence
in
the
region
australia
which
has
backed
away
from
its
own
commitment
to
paris
without
exiting
the
pact
was
among
the
nations
of
the
pacific
islands
forum
that
made
the
call
at
a
meeting
of
leaders
on
the
tiny
island
state
of
nauru
climate
change
presents
the
single
greatest
threat
to
the
livelihood
security
and
of
pacific
people
the
leaders
said
in
a
communique
asking
the
united
states
to
return
to
the
climate
pact
tuvalu
prime
minister
enele
sopoaga
told
a
news
conference
the
aspiration
is
for
the
to
be
in
the
paris
agreement
again
because
we
can
not
have
comprehensive
robust
emission
reduction
unless
the
biggest
emitter
of
greenhouse
gas
is
there
in
the
process
we
can
not
leave
the
however
participants
said
one
country
would
not
agree
to
even
stronger
language
in
the
communique
and
sopoaga
made
clear
which
it
was
although
he
stopped
short
of
naming
it

the

letter
a
australia
s
representative
at
the
meeting
foreign
minister
marise
payne
declined
to
answer
questions
about
sopoaga
s
comments
it
is
not
appropriate
to
discuss
the
internal
talks
of
the
private
leaders
retreat
payne
said
in
an
emailed
statement
australia
understands
the
importance
that
pacific
countries
place
on
effective
global
action
to
combat
climate
change
she
said
the
demand
for
action
over
the
islands
of
the
pacific
seen
as
the
front
line
of
global
climate
change
comes
as
rising
sea
levels
and
other
crises
force
residents
to
move
to
higher
ground
against
this
backdrop
china
s
vocal
support
for
tackling
global
warming
aids
its
drive
to
win
allies
and
influence
in
the
strategically
significant
and
area
president
donald
trump
who
has
called
climate
change
a
hoax
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
the
paris
agreement
in
saying
it
favored
other
countries
and
put
the
united
states
at
a
disadvantage
climate
change
is
domestic
political
dynamite
in
australia
one
of
the
world
s
largest
coal
exporters
which
has
also
sought
to
push
back
against
china
s
influence
in
the
pacific
wednesday
s
communique
endorsed
with
qualification
a
separate
stronger
statement
from
seven
small
pacific
island
states
seeking
urgent
resolution
of
paris
rules
to
cap
the
rise
in
global
temperatures
at
degrees
celsius
if
that
cap
is
not
reached
there
are
going
to
be
serious
problems
on
islands
like
tuvalu
sopoaga
said
citing
an
estimate
of
island
submergence
by
from
the
geological
survey
is
not
far
away
our
grandchildren
would
still
be
growing
up
and
the
islands
of
tuvalu
and
kiribati
and
maybe
part
of
nauru
would
be
submerged
