austrian
oil
and
gas
group
omv
plans
to
expand
its
exploration
business
with
an
acquisition
in
southeast
asia
by
the
end
of
the
year
in
line
with
its
strategy
to
grow
in
markets
outside
europe
its
upstream
chief
told
reuters
omv
is
betting
on
further
growth
in
fossil
fuels
instead
of
flocking
to
renewables
like
many
of
its
rivals
forecasting
a
strong
increase
in
demand
for
natural
gas
in
particular
because
burning
it
emits
less
carbon
dioxide
than
oil
the
group
whose
presence
in
russia
and
countries
such
as
libya
and
yemen
makes
it
vulnerable
to
geopolitical
tensions
there
expanded
in
new
zealand
and
the
united
arab
emirates
earlier
this
year
to
try
to
balance
risks
johann
pleininger
responsible
for
omv
s
exploration
and
production
business
has
compiled
a
list
of
three
to
five
companies
and
to
assets
that
are
attractive
for
us
in
australia
indonesia
thailand
vietnam
and
malaysia
he
told
reuters
in
an
interview
i
hope
that
we
will
be
able
to
conclude
a
contract
by
the
end
of
the
year
he
said
without
elaborating
on
the
size
of
the
expected
deal
of
the
billion
euros
billion
set
aside
for
acquisitions
until
omv
has
so
far
spent
billion
pleininger
declined
to
comment
on
a
reuters
report
last
month
that
omv
was
interested
in
the
malaysian
gas
fields
of
peer
hess
corp
however
he
said
any
deal
would
have
to
be
in
cooperation
with
a
strong
regional
player
comparable
to
omv
s
partnership
with
gazprom
in
russia
and
with
abu
dhabi
national
oil
company
adnoc
in
the
united
arab
emirates
such
a
partner
was
important
to
secure
support
in
another
country
said
the
austrian
who
has
been
working
for
omv
for
more
than
years
hess
is
an
equal
partner
with
energy
firm
petronas
in
the
malaysian
fields
omv
s
focus
on
low
costs
introduced
when
rainer
seele
took
the
group
s
helm
three
years
ago
requires
further
asset
sales
pleininger
said
the
partly
group
recently
agreed
to
sell
its
stakes
in
the
norwegian
polarled
gas
pipeline
project
and
in
the
nyhamma
gas
processing
plant
to
private
capeomega
he
told
reuters
the
supervisory
board
and
the
norwegian
government
still
had
to
approve
the
deal
a
asset
in
tunisia
where
the
austrian
company
has
been
operating
since
and
an
asset
in
madagascar
were
also
on
pleininger
s
list
of
assets
to
sell
thanks
to
seele
s
focus
on
countries
such
as
russia
omv
s
production
costs
have
more
than
halved
since
to
produce
one
barrel
of
oil
equivalent
boe
or
the
amount
of
energy
equivalent
to
that
found
in
a
barrel
of
crude
oil
cost
it
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
there
is
not
too
much
room
for
further
improvements
according
to
pleininger
but
the
internal
goal
was
less
than
which
would
put
omv
among
the
best
in
the
industry
regarding
a
long
planned
asset
swap
with
gazprom
pleininger
said
he
hoped
for
a
solution
by
the
end
of
the
year
our
priority
is
still
the
asset
swap
he
said
when
asked
about
a
reuters
report
that
the
group
might
prefer
to
simply
buy
some
of
its
partner
s
siberian
assets
instead
of
swapping
them
after
norway
criticized
the
plan
to
give
gazprom
access
to
assets
in
norway
but
he
also
said
the
deal
s
significance
had
been
different
when
agreed
in
when
omv
was
struggling
with
weakening
reserves
and
no
financial
buffer
its
cash
position
stood
at
billion
euros
at
the
end
of
june
for
us
it
is
important
to
have
a
solution
