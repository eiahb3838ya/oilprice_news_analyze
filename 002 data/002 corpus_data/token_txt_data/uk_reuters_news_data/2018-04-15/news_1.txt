canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
on
sunday
moved
to
end
an
escalating
crisis
over
a
kinder
morgan
canada
ltd
oil
pipeline
saying
ottawa
was
prepared
to
offer
financial
aid
to
ensure
the
project
went
ahead
trudeau
cited
investor
confidence
as
one
reason
to
help
kinder
morgan
canada
part
of
kinder
morgan
inc
which
plans
to
almost
triple
the
capacity
of
its
trans
mountain
line
from
alberta
to
the
pacific
province
of
british
columbia
the
company
unhappy
about
moves
by
the
british
columbia
government
to
impede
the
c
billion
billion
project
on
environmental
grounds
is
threatening
to
walk
away
unless
it
receives
sufficient
clarity
about
the
path
ahead
by
may
i
have
instructed
the
minister
of
finance
to
initiate
formal
financial
discussions
with
kinder
morgan
the
result
of
which
will
be
to
remove
the
uncertainty
overhanging
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
expansion
project
trudeau
told
reporters
calling
the
line
a
vital
strategic
interest
to
trudeau
speaking
after
an
emergency
summit
with
the
premiers
of
alberta
and
british
columbia
said
we
are
actively
pursuing
legislative
options
that
will
assert
and
reinforce
the
government
of
canada
s
jurisdiction
in
this
he
declined
to
give
details
on
exactly
what
the
ruling
liberals
had
in
mind
to
end
an
impasse
that
is
prompting
investor
unease
and
could
threaten
his
political
future
both
the
federal
and
alberta
governments
have
already
suggested
they
could
take
a
stake
in
the
project
speaking
before
the
meeting
a
federal
government
source
said
past
examples
of
help
included
a
bailout
of
the
auto
industry
in
federal
loan
guarantees
for
a
project
and
ottawa
s
investment
in
an
offshore
energy
project
construction
will
go
ahead
said
trudeau
who
is
under
increasing
pressure
from
the
business
community
and
opposition
politicians
to
take
action
amid
fears
the
dispute
could
hit
already
flagging
foreign
investment
kinder
morgan
canada
said
it
would
not
comment
on
trudeau
s
remarks
until
we
ve
reached
a
sufficiently
definitive
agreement
on
or
before
may
that
satisfies
our
many
in
the
energy
industry
are
concerned
about
whether
quarrels
over
jurisdiction
and
increasingly
vehement
protests
mean
any
new
pipelines
can
be
built
in
canada
which
sits
on
the
world
s
proven
reserves
of
crude
and
is
the
single
largest
exporter
of
energy
to
the
united
states
the
lack
of
pipeline
capacity
means
canadian
crude
trades
at
a
discount
to
the
oil
benchmark
environmentalists
and
aboriginal
activists
frequently
demonstrate
at
trans
mountain
facilities
and
british
columbia
police
have
arrested
about
people
since
the
federal
government
can
t
buy
off
the
opposition
to
this
failing
pipeline
the
resistance
continues
to
grow
said
mike
hudema
of
greenpeace
canada
although
trudeau
s
liberal
government
could
invoke
emergency
powers
to
ensure
the
project
goes
ahead
that
would
most
likely
anger
voters
in
british
columbia
and
cost
the
liberals
support
in
a
federal
election
in
october
alberta
premier
rachel
notley
who
also
attended
the
talks
in
ottawa
said
she
was
convinced
the
expansion
would
be
built
if
the
financial
assistance
deal
could
be
worked
out
british
columbia
premier
john
horgan
said
after
the
meeting
he
had
not
changed
his
position
that
the
risks
of
a
spill
from
the
pipeline
were
too
great
horgan
wants
ottawa
to
refer
the
matter
to
the
supreme
court
but
the
liberals
are
not
interested
saying
it
is
already
clear
the
federal
government
has
jurisdiction
over
the
project
horgan
also
said
he
would
ask
the
courts
in
british
columbia
to
make
clear
how
much
powers
the
province
had
to
protect
the
provincial
environment
federal
officials
complain
this
is
a
tactic
