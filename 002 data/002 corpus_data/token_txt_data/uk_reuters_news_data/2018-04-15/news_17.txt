canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
will
on
sunday
try
to
tackle
an
escalating
dispute
over
a
oil
pipeline
project
that
threatens
to
undermine
his
political
and
economic
agenda
kinder
morgan
canada
ltd
wants
to
almost
triple
the
capacity
of
its
trans
mountain
pipeline
from
alberta
to
the
pacific
province
of
british
columbia
which
strongly
opposes
the
idea
on
environmental
grounds
trudeau
who
says
the
expansion
will
benefit
the
economy
and
needs
to
proceed
is
due
to
hold
a
emergency
meeting
at
am
et
gmt
with
the
premiers
of
both
provinces
this
is
not
about
punishing
british
columbians
this
is
not
about
hurting
canadians
this
is
about
bringing
forward
a
project
in
the
national
interest
he
told
reporters
in
peru
late
on
saturday
before
returning
to
ottawa
we
will
do
it
in
such
a
way
that
doesn
t
seek
to
further
polarize
or
raise
the
temperature
in
this
although
trudeau
s
liberal
government
could
invoke
emergency
powers
to
ensure
the
project
goes
ahead
that
would
most
likely
anger
voters
in
british
columbia
and
cost
the
liberals
support
in
a
federal
election
in
october
but
trudeau
is
under
increasing
pressure
from
the
business
community
and
opposition
politicians
to
take
action
amid
fears
the
dispute
could
hit
already
flagging
foreign
investment
in
the
absence
of
a
swift
resolution
to
this
issue
foreign
and
domestic
investors
will
be
left
to
question
whether
canada
is
a
suitable
place
to
invest
said
john
manley
president
of
the
business
council
of
canada
and
a
former
liberal
finance
minister
both
the
federal
and
alberta
governments
have
suggested
they
could
take
a
stake
in
the
project
there
are
enough
determined
parties
that
a
solution
will
be
reached
it
won
t
be
easy
it
s
not
an
easy
issue
none
of
this
is
a
senior
government
official
said
ahead
of
the
meeting
british
columbia
premier
john
horgan
told
reporters
on
saturday
he
wanted
to
protect
his
province
against
the
catastrophic
consequences
of
a
pipeline
leak
he
wants
ottawa
to
refer
the
matter
to
the
supreme
court
but
the
liberals
are
not
interested
saying
it
is
already
clear
the
federal
government
has
jurisdiction
over
the
project
horgan
s
office
says
he
plans
to
speak
to
reporters
at
am
suggesting
he
will
not
be
talking
for
long
to
trudeau
and
alberta
premier
rachel
notley
trudeau
is
set
to
face
the
media
