german
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
on
sunday
criticised
russia
for
a
series
of
activities
beyond
its
borders
blaming
it
for
a
cyber
attack
on
his
own
ministry
and
said
moscow
must
change
its
ways
maas
listed
a
series
of
what
he
called
problematic
actions
that
also
included
the
lack
of
progress
in
implementing
a
ceasefire
in
eastern
ukraine
a
poison
gas
attack
in
britain
support
for
the
syrian
government
and
efforts
to
influence
western
elections
we
had
an
attack
on
the
foreign
ministry
where
we
have
to
assume
that
it
stemmed
from
russia
he
told
the
german
broadcaster
zdf
we
can
t
just
wish
all
that
away
and
i
think
it
s
not
only
reasonable
but
necessary
to
point
out
that
we
do
not
view
those
as
constructive
german
government
officials
in
february
disclosed
what
they
called
an
isolated
cyber
attack
on
the
government
computer
network
that
was
first
discovered
in
december
the
head
of
germany
s
domestic
intelligence
agency
last
week
said
there
was
a
high
likelihood
that
moscow
was
behind
the
attack
maas
a
social
democrat
who
has
adopted
a
tougher
stance
on
russia
than
his
predecessors
from
the
same
party
told
the
other
german
public
broadcaster
ard
on
sunday
that
moscow
had
been
an
increasingly
difficult
partner
but
berlin
was
committed
to
maintaining
dialogue
particularly
on
the
crisis
in
syria
it
is
time
i
think
to
point
out
that
we
expect
constructive
contributions
from
the
russian
side
including
on
the
syrian
conflict
and
also
that
they
don
t
always
simply
protect
syrian
president
bashar
he
said
russia
has
denied
any
efforts
to
influence
western
elections
and
scoffed
at
suggestions
it
was
behind
the
cyber
attack
in
germany
it
also
denied
involvement
in
a
poison
gas
attack
on
a
former
russian
double
agent
and
his
daughter
in
britain
western
air
strikes
aimed
at
destroying
syria
s
chemical
weapons
facilities
have
exacerbated
tensions
between
moscow
and
the
west
already
at
a
new
war
high
after
the
expulsion
of
more
than
russian
diplomats
in
response
to
the
nerve
agent
attack
on
sergei
skripal
syria
denied
using
chemical
weapons
against
its
civilian
population
german
president
steinmeier
another
social
democrat
who
has
served
as
foreign
minister
on
sunday
warned
against
demonising
russia
and
said
germany
had
a
particular
role
to
play
in
maintaining
dialogue
with
moscow
given
its
history
steinmeier
told
the
bild
am
sonntag
newspaper
he
was
concerned
about
a
galloping
alienation
between
russia
and
the
west
and
urged
german
politicians
to
avoid
portraying
russia
and
its
people
as
an
enemy
maas
on
saturday
called
for
a
new
international
effort
to
end
the
war
in
syria
and
said
germany
would
use
its
relationship
with
moscow
to
ensure
russia
played
a
constructive
role
whether
we
like
it
or
not
the
syrian
conflict
can
not
be
resolved
without
russia
he
said
on
sunday
germany
which
relies
on
russia
for
about
a
third
of
the
gas
it
uses
has
long
walked
a
careful
line
with
moscow
pushing
for
continued
sanctions
over
ukraine
and
eastern
ukraine
while
also
maintaining
dialogue
and
trade
