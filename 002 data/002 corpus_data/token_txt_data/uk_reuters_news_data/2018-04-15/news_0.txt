update 2-oil, gold open lower despite syria strikes; russian retaliation in focus
york
reuters
gold
and
oil
traded
slightly
lower
as
markets
opened
for
the
first
time
since
western
powers
launched
a
missile
attack
on
syria
but
equities
are
unlikely
to
experience
big
losses
unless
the
west
strikes
again
or
russia
retaliates
the
news
flow
is
actually
better
than
what
it
looked
like
at
one
point
during
last
week
as
the
strike
was
surgical
followed
by
a
pullback
reports
show
a
lot
of
care
was
taken
not
to
hit
russian
targets
which
is
a
good
sign
and
the
market
should
take
heart
from
that
said
salman
ahmed
chief
investment
strategist
at
lombard
odier
investment
managers
in
london
speaking
before
trading
resumed
spot
gold
and
major
crude
benchmarks
eased
slightly
as
the
market
reacted
to
the
military
actions
over
the
weekend
treasuries
also
weakened
while
equities
rose
gold
has
benefited
in
recent
days
as
a
asset
amid
a
trade
dispute
and
the
escalating
conflict
in
syria
which
also
pushed
oil
above
a
barrel
because
of
concerns
about
a
spike
in
middle
eastern
tensions
it
ended
up
being
a
very
measured
attack
said
john
kilduff
a
partner
at
again
capital
management
in
new
york
the
greater
fears
of
the
oil
market
of
this
spilling
into
a
greater
conflict
that
could
involve
iran
and
saudi
arabia
has
not
and
will
not
come
to
world
stocks
wobbled
last
week
but
still
ended
with
the
best
weekly
gain
in
over
a
month
as
investors
await
potentially
healthy
company
earnings
despite
heightened
geopolitical
risks
the
impact
on
assets
has
been
and
modest
while
the
yen
rose
initially
on
fears
of
a
syrian
strike
it
ended
near
lows
to
the
dollar
last
week
on
saturday
french
and
british
missile
attacks
struck
at
the
heart
of
syria
s
chemical
weapons
program
in
retaliation
for
a
suspected
poison
gas
attack
a
week
ago
although
the
assault
appeared
unlikely
to
halt
syrian
president
bashar
s
progress
in
the
civil
war
for
map
of
syrian
strikes
see
the
bombing
denounced
by
damascus
and
its
allies
as
an
illegal
act
of
aggression
was
the
biggest
intervention
by
western
countries
against
assad
and
his
powerful
ally
russia
but
the
three
countries
said
the
strikes
were
limited
to
syria
s
chemical
weapons
capabilities
and
not
aimed
at
toppling
assad
or
intervening
in
the
civil
war
naeem
aslam
chief
market
analyst
at
think
markets
said
gold
was
poised
to
gain
on
monday
but
the
rally
would
not
be
very
steep
the
focus
will
be
on
the
from
gold
often
used
as
a
store
of
value
in
times
of
political
and
economic
uncertainty
could
rally
toward
per
ounce
after
two
consecutive
weeks
of
gains
if
we
do
break
above
that
next
week
we
would
be
very
bullish
said
aslam
tokyo
will
be
the
first
major
market
to
open
on
monday
and
the
yen
will
likely
strengthen
to
the
dollar
but
not
beyond
said
itsuo
toshima
market
analyst
at
toshima
associates
adding
that
he
did
not
expect
stocks
traders
to
make
sharp
moves
the
first
attack
was
within
expectations
and
was
already
priced
in
the
market
however
if
there
is
a
second
round
of
strikes
that
is
not
in
line
with
expectations
so
that
should
prompt
a
sharp
move
in
markets
he
added
frank
benzimra
head
of
global
markets
for
asia
pacific
at
societe
generale
corporate
and
investment
banking
said
stocks
would
plunge
only
in
case
of
new
strikes
by
western
powers
in
case
of
such
an
escalation
oil
would
rally
further
the
yen
would
spike
and
japan
s
domestic
defensive
stocks
would
outperform
international
stocks
for
the
stress
on
asia
equity
markets
to
be
sustainable
we
would
need
to
have
oil
prices
spiking
to
such
a
level
that
fundamental
concerns
higher
inflation
and
risks
on
growth
return
to
the
market
he
said
amrita
sen
from
energy
aspects
said
that
despite
middle
eastern
tensions
and
looming
new
sanctions
on
iran
oil
had
outperformed
most
expectations
this
year
and
may
have
rallied
too
far
too
fast
we
are
likely
to
get
a
this
week
as
the
extent
of
the
syrian
strikes
have
been
muted
and
in
general
calmer
nerves
prevail
in
washington
she
said
oil
traders
had
locked
in
long
positions
ahead
of
the
weekend
in
anticipation
of
potential
strikes
sending
both
west
