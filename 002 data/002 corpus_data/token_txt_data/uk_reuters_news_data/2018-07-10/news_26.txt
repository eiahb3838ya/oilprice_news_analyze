new plasma melting plant opens at bulgaria's nuclear power site
sofia
reuters
bulgaria
has
opened
a
new
plasma
melting
plant
that
will
treat
and
dispose
of
radioactive
waste
at
its
kozloduy
nuclear
power
plant
the
european
bank
for
reconstruction
and
development
ebrd
said
on
tuesday
the
million
euros
million
facility
will
significantly
reduce
the
volume
of
low
and
radioactive
waste
from
kozloduy
s
two
megawatt
units
as
well
as
from
the
four
smaller
reactors
that
have
been
shut
between
and
in
a
breakthrough
in
the
treatment
and
disposal
of
radioactive
waste
a
plasma
melting
plant
has
started
operations
at
the
site
of
the
kozloduy
nuclear
power
plant
in
bulgaria
the
ebrd
which
manages
the
kozloduy
international
decommissioning
support
fund
said
the
fund
has
provided
percent
of
the
financing
for
the
plant
with
the
rest
coming
from
the
bulgarian
government
the
new
technology
allows
for
treatment
of
waste
with
a
minimal
risk
of
radioactive
contamination
as
the
final
waste
form
is
free
from
organics
and
liquids
it
will
meet
strict
quality
and
stability
requirements
for
storage
or
final
disposal
the
ebrd
said
the
plasma
plant
built
by
a
joint
venture
of
spain
s
iberdrola
and
belgium
s
belgoprocess
has
a
capacity
up
to
tonnes
per
year
the
ebrd
said
it
can
also
retreat
historical
radioactive
waste
which
can
make
the
new
technology
potentially
widely
applicable
beyond
kozloduy
it
said
last
year
bulgaria
started
the
construction
of
a
national
depot
for
radioactive
waste
that
should
become
operational
