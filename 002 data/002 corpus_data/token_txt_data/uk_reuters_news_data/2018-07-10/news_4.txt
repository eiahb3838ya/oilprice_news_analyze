the
sale
of
a
remote
canadian
refinery
has
been
scuttled
as
two
former
oil
traders
running
the
company
locked
horns
over
the
value
of
the
plant
according
to
three
people
familiar
with
the
discussions
the
partners
former
traders
neal
shear
and
kaushik

sought
to
sell
the

newfoundland
last
year
to
privately
held
canadian
refiner
irving
oil
which
was
seen
as
the
leading
bidder
the
deal
fell
apart
in
recent
months
and
is
unlikely
to
be
rekindled
because
shear
and
amin
are
at
odds
over
the
sale
price
according
to
three
people
familiar
with
the
firm
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
as
the
events
were
private
shear
was
ready
to
sell
to
irving
for
an
undisclosed
value
that
two
of
the
people
said
was
about
c
million
million

pushing
for

has
since
been
removed
from
the

website
and
talks
with
irving
have
been
put
on

there
are
no
longer
any
immediate

the
refinery
s
value
has
fluctuated
widely
over
the
last
years
it
was
sold
for
c
billion
billion
in
and
for
c
million
three
years
later
but
the
two
bought
it
in
for
just
c
million
due
to
a
slump
in
world
oil
prices
having
paid
less
than
any
other
buyer
of
the
plant
amin
and
shear
wanted
to
use
come
by
chance
as
a
linchpin
for
later
purchases
of
other
fuel
shipping
infrastructure
globally
or
to
sell
quickly
at
a
profit
come
by
chance
s
value
for
suitors
is
hampered
by
its
isolated
locale
reducing
its
access
to
cheap
domestic
crude
that
has
boosted
margins
for
gulf
coast
or
midwest
refiners
and
because
it
lacks
the
processing
scale
of
larger
refineries
the
refinery
s
relative
proximity
to
europe
and
shorter
shipping
time
to
eastern
ports
in
latin
america
is
an
advantage
but
it
has
still
been
hurt
by
slimmer
margins
than
other
north
american
refiners
