warmest may since 1900 to cost norwegians $2.34 bln more for power this year

norwegians
enjoyed
the
warmest
may
this
year
since
records
began
in
but
as
rainfall
has
been
unusually
low
the
treat
will
cost
them
about
billion
euros
billion
in
higher
power
bills
norway
s
energy
regulator
told
reuters
the
unseasonable
weather
accelerated
snow
melt
in
the
mountains
but
some
of
the
water
soaked
into
the
dry
land
or
evaporated
and
did
not
end
up
in
the
reservoirs
that
feed
norway
s
hydropower
plants
raising
electricity
prices
the
warmth
was
accompanied
by
percent
lower
than
normal
rainfall
this
spring
but
the
thousands
of
happy
norwegians
who
flocked
to
sunbathe
and
swim
now
face
payback
in
the
form
of
higher
electricity
bills
the
total
cost
for
power
this
year
for
households
which
consume
terawatt
hours
twh
annually
will
be
billion
euros
higher
than
last
year
vegard
willumsen
section
manager
at
norway
s
water
resources
and
energy
directorate
nve
said
the
added
cost
for
norway
s
entire
power
consumption
including
industry
corresponding
to
about
twh
in
total
can
be
calculated
in
the
same
way
he
added
that
would
bring
the
total
extra
cost
for
power
usage
alone
to
just
over
billion
euros
on
top
of
that
households
and
industrial
consumers
must
pay
taxes
and
grid
tariff
costs
power
prices
were
on
average
percent
higher
this
year
comparing
to
the
second
quarter
of
nve
said
in
a
press
release
on
tuesday
a
number
of
other
factors
contributed
to
the
extra
power
cost
for
norway
such
as
the
price
of
coal
gas
and
emissions
which
made
power
imports
more
expensive
as
a
result
on
a
household
level
a
typical
consumer
in
norway
will
see
his
annual
bill
rise
by
about
crowns
nve
calculated
the
figure
using
power
prices
so
far
and
its
outlook
for
continued
high
prices
in
the
future
the
downturn
in
spring
caused
norwegian
power
generation
and
net
exports
to
fall
by
twh
compared
to
the
second
quarter
of
net
exports
totaled
only
twh
which
is
unusually
low
during
the
snow
melt
said
nve
most
of
the
snow
has
melted
and
we
can
expect
less
intake
than
usual
in
the
future
however
the
power
supply
in
norway
is
not
threatened
by
the
drought
since
we
have
a
lot
of
water
to
take
off
we
also
have
the
ability
to
import
power
