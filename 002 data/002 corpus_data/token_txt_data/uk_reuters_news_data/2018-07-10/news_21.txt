oslo
reuters
hundreds
of
workers
on
norwegian
offshore
oil
and
gas
rigs
went
on
strike
on
tuesday
after
rejecting
a
proposed
wage
deal
leading
to
the
shutdown
of
one
field
and
helping
send
brent
crude
prices
higher
one
union
said
hundreds
more
workers
would
join
the
strike
on
sunday
if
an
agreement
over
union
demands
for
a
wage
increase
and
pension
rights
was
not
reached
royal
dutch
shell
said
that
due
to
the
strike
it
was
temporarily
closing
production
at
its
knarr
field
which
has
a
daily
output
of
barrels
of
mostly
oil
but
also
natural
gas
liquids
and
natural
gas
shutting
the
field
whose
owners
are
idemitsu
wintershall
and
dea
could
take
up
to
hours
it
said
norway
is
western
europe
s
biggest
oil
producer
the
disruption
added
to
a
rise
in
global
oil
supply
outages
and
helped
push
brent
crude
up
percent
to
per
barrel
the
output
of
norway
s
biggest
oil
producer
equinor
formerly
known
as
statoil
was
not
affected
so
far
the
company
said
even
though
it
was
shutting
drilling
operations
at
its
snorre
b
platform
shortly
after
a
midnight
deadline
passed
a
mediator
said
talks
between
two
trade
unions
safe
and
ys
and
the
shipowners
association
representing
the
rig
employers
had
failed
to
reach
a
deal
the
parties
were
so
far
apart
from
each
other
there
was
no
point
presenting
a
proposal
that
could
be
recommended
to
both
sides
mediator
carl
petter
martinsen
said
in
a
statement
the
safe
union
wants
pension
rights
to
be
the
same
for
everyone
regardless
of
whether
an
employee
is
new
to
a
company
or
has
many
years
of
experience
it
also
wants
wages
for
drilling
workers
to
match
those
of
workers
for
oil
companies
which
are
higher
the
norwegian
shipowners
association
said
safe
was
asking
for
a
norwegian
crown
pounds
salary
increase
for
unskilled
workers
equivalent
to
about
percent
of
current
wages
the
leader
of
safe
said
she
did
not
recognise
the
figures
presented
by
the
shipowners
association
around
workers
would
walk
out
from
tuesday
with
an
additional
employees
joining
them
from
midnight
on
sunday
if
the
dispute
is
not
resolved
safe
said
in
letters
to
the
shipowners
association
in
total
up
to

could
join
the
action
it

whom
worked
in
production
and
in
related
services
according
to
statistics
norway
the
rest
were
occupied
in
transportation
through
pipelines
it
was
the
biggest
strike
affecting
the
sector
since
a
industrial
action
in
cut
the
country
s
output
of
crude
by
about
percent
and
its
natural
gas
production
by
about
percent
talks
between
the
two
striking
norwegian
unions
and
rig
employers
will
not
resume
for
a
few
days
the
leader
of
safe
rysst
told
reuters
we
have
no
contact
with
the
employers
yet
it

take
some
days
at

before
we
hear

they
want
to

us

probably
reach
out
to
us
before
the
bigger
strike
on
sunday

shipowners
association
representing
the
employers
said
it
was
keen
to
resolve
the
situation

have
no
scheduled

but
we
have
every
will
to
seek
a
solution
