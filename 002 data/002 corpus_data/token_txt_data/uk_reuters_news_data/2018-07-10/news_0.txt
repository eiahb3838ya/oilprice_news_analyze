the
department
of
agriculture
will
stop
giving
crop
data
under
embargo
to
media
starting
next
month
in
an
attempt
to
make
the
release
of
information
more
fair
officials
said
on
tuesday
the
change
means
news
organizations
will
gain
access
to
reports
on
global
grain
supplies
and
demand
at
the
same
time
as
the
general
public
the
usda
for
years
allowed
media
including
reuters
early
access
to
crop
data
but
barred
news
outlets
from
publishing
the
data
until
a
specified
time
providing
the
information
under
an
embargo
gave
reporters
time
to
analyze
the
data
which
can
roil
grain
prices
and
prepare
news
reports
but
the
usda
said
the
system
effectively
gave
a
head
start
to
customers
of
media
outlets
because
usda
takes
longer
to
publish
the
data
on
its
website
than
the
news
sites
after
public
inquiries
the
agency
determined
this
gave
some
media
users
a
trading
advantage
the
new
procedures
will
level
the
playing
field
and
make
the
issuance
of
the
reports
fair
to
everyone
involved
usda
secretary
sonny
perdue
said
evidence
suggested
that
trading
activity
worth
millions
of
dollars
occurred
in
the
two
seconds
after
monthly
crop
reports
were
released
at
eastern
gmt
the
inference
is
that
private
agents
are
paying
the
news
agencies
for
faster
data
transmission
to
get
a
jump
on
the
market
the
usda
said
the
news
media
are
allowed
access
to
crop
data
about
minutes
early
in
a
room
at
usda
headquarters
in
washington
with
their
reports
embargoed
until
noon
the
media
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
getting
access
to
that
data
so
they
can
disseminate
it
to
the
public
said
kirsten
wegner
chief
executive
of
modern
markets
initiative
which
represents
high
speed
and
algorithmic
traders
if
they
re
making
it
available
to
all
media
and
not
a
select
few
then
there
should
not
be
a
problem
with
the
last
report
available
to
the
media
under
embargo
is
scheduled
for
release
on
thursday
