washington
reuters
brett
kavanaugh
nominated
on
monday
to
be
a
supreme
court
justice
by
president
donald
trump
is
a
skeptic
of
business
regulations
especially
on
rules
limiting
harmful
emissions
although
he
has
called
global
warming
an
urgent
issue
if
confirmed
by
the
senate
the
conservative
judge
who
is
well
known
in
washington
legal
circles
could
serve
for
decades
and
have
a
major
say
over
environmental
regulations
issued
by
future
presidents
long
after
trump
has
left
office
michael
brune
president
of
the
sierra
club
an
environmental
activist
group
said
kavanaugh
is
an
extreme
ideologue
who
has
time
and
again
proven
himself
hostile
to
environmental
a
judge
on
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
since
kavanaugh
often
hears
challenges
to
regulations
brought
by
business
groups
such
as
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
in
line
with
the
views
of
white
house
counsel
don
mcgahn
who
led
the
supreme
court
nominee
selection
process
kavanaugh
has
questioned
environmental
regulations
issued
by
former
democratic
president
barack
obama
and
the
legal
reach
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
the
selection
of
judge
kavanaugh
shows
that
the
trump
administration
is
serious
about
taming
the
administrative
state
said
jonathan
adler
a
law
professor
at
case
western
reserve
university
school
of
law
last
year
kavanaugh
wrote
a
ruling
that
struck
down
a
rule
regulating
hydrofluorocarbons
used
in
spray
cans
and
air
conditioners
scientists
say
they
contribute
to
climate
change
hydrofluorocarbon
manufacturers
including
mexichem
fluor
inc
a
unit
of
mexichem
sab
de
cv
and
arkema
inc
part
of
arkema
sa
were
part
of
a
coalition
that
challenged
the
regulation
however
much
we
might
sympathize
or
agree
with
epa
s
policy
objectives
epa
may
act
only
within
the
boundaries
of
its
statutory
authority
kavanaugh
wrote
companies
that
supported
the
regulation
including
honeywell
international
inc
last
month
filed
court
papers
asking
the
supreme
court
to
reinstate
it
if
kavanaugh
were
confirmed
as
a
supreme
court
justice
and
the
hydrofluorocarbon
case
came
to
the
court
he
would
be
recused
no
other
major
emissions
case
is
clearly
headed
for
the
supreme
court
s
docket
in
its
next
term
beginning
in
october
but
kavanaugh
s
record
could
shape
future
cases
in
he
disagreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision
to
uphold
the
obama
administration
s
first
efforts
to
regulate
greenhouse
gas
emissions
the
regulations
were
challenged
by
business
groups
and
energy
companies
such
as
alpha
natural
resources
inc
which
went
through
a
bankruptcy
in
and
massey
energy
co
later
bought
by
alpha
when
the
court
refused
to
reconsider
its
ruling
kavanaugh
dissented
saying
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
had
exceeded
its
authority
in
seeking
to
regulate
carbon
emissions
under
a
specific
epa
program
he
stopped
short
of
saying
that
agency
could
not
regulate
greenhouse
gas
emissions
altogether
however
the
task
of
dealing
with
global
warming
is
urgent
and
important
he
wrote
the
conservative
supreme
court
majority
in
agreed
with
kavanaugh
on
the
point
he
raised
in
the
case
although
it
upheld
most
of
the
obama
regulations
in
another
environmental
case
kavanaugh
in
criticized
the
obama
administration
for
not
considering
the
costs
of
a
rule
limiting
emissions
of
mercury
and
other
hazardous
pollutants
mainly
from
power
plants
peabody
energy
corp
a
major
coal
producer
was
among
companies
opposing
the
regulation
to
be
sure
epa
could
conclude
that
the
benefits
outweigh
the
costs
but
the
problem
here
is
that
epa
did
not
even
consider
the
costs
kavanaugh
wrote
again
the
conservative
majority
of
the
supreme
court
later
agreed
ruling
in
on
a
vote
that
the
obama
administration
should
have
considered
compliance
costs
