trump allows oil surveys that conservationists say harm whales, dolphins
washington
reuters
the
trump
administration
on
friday
gave
five
companies
initial
permission
to
conduct
surveys
of
oil
and
gas
deposits
beneath
a
vast
region
off
the
east
coast
using
blasts
that
conservationists
say
put
whales
and
dolphins
at
risk
the
fisheries
office
of
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
issued
permits
to
westerngeco
llc
a
subsidiary
of
schlumberger
ltd
and
cgg
to
harass
but
not
kill
marine
mammals
with
air
gun
blasts
in
a
region
of
the
atlantic
from
delaware
to
cape
canaveral
florida
the
permits
that
also
went
to
ion
geoventures
spectrum
geo
inc
and
geophysical
company
are
likely
to
increase
tensions
between
the
administration
which
wants
to
open
up
offshore
drilling
with
governors
from
the
east
coast
who
oppose
it
president
donald
trump
has
espoused
an
energy
dominance
agenda
to
boost
oil
output
for
consumption
and
for
exports
conservationists
worry
that
marine
mammals
including
the
endangered
north
atlantic
right
whale
could
be
harmed
and
that
the
practice
could
lead
to
beachings
of
the
species
trump
is
essentially
giving
these
companies
permission
to
harass
harm
and
possibly
even
kill
marine
life
all
in
the
pursuit
of
dirty
and
dangerous
offshore
oil
said
diane
hoskins
a
campaign
director
at
the
oceana
environmental
group
this
is
the
first
step
toward
offshore
drilling
in
the
noaa
said
impacts
on
marine
mammal
populations
would
be
limited
we
ve
been
assured
that
the
effects
of
the
authorizations
do
not
result
in
jeopardy
to
endangered
or
threatened
species
donna
wieting
director
of
the
noaa
fisheries
office
of
protected
resources
told
reporters
in
a
teleconference
benjamin
laws
a
noaa
fisheries
biologist
said
the
permits
require
protections
for
right
whales
in
places
they
are
expected
to
be
present
the
companies
can
not
conduct
surveys
within
about
miles
km
from
shore
between
and
april
in
such
areas
laws
said
if
any
right
whales
are
spotted
within
just
under
a
mile
of
a
survey
ship
the
tests
must
be
shut
down
he
added
the
administration
of
former
president
barack
obama
denied
six
permits
two
weeks
before
trump
became
president
saying
that
the
value
of
information
from
the
air
gun
surveys
would
not
outweigh
potential
risks
to
marine
life
if
as
expected
the
bureau
of
ocean
energy
management
issues
the
companies
further
permitting
they
will
be
able
to
conduct
air
gun
surveys
in
the
atlantic
for
the
first
time
since
