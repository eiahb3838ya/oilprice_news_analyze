s
meeting
in

people
don

want
to
get

optimistic
heading

you
don

know
how
tough

ll
be
with
this
meeting

these

added

the
anticipation
showing
that
growth
in
china
s
vast
manufacturing
sector
had
stalled
this
month
for
the
first
time

more
than
two
years
trump
has
sent
mixed
signals
saying
i
think
we
re
very
close
to
doing
something
with
china
but
i
don
t
know
that
i
want
to
do
it
because
the
money
coming
in
from
the
tariffs
he
has
imposed
has
been
so
lucrative
the
dollar
rose
as
investors
prepared
for
fallout
from
the
talks
which
are
expected
to
increase
volatility
across
