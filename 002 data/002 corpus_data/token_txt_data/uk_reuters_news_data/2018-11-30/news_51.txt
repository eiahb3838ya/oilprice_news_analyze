singapore
s
maritime
port
authority
mpa
will
ban
the
discharge
of
wash
water
used
in
ships
to
scrub
engine
exhaust
from
the
mpa
said
on
friday
the
ban
of
scrubbers
is
part
of
an
effort
to
prepare
one
of
the
world
s
busiest
ports
for
international
maritime
organization
imo
rules
that
come
into
force
in
and
oblige
ships
to
use
cleaner
fuels
to
protect
the
marine
environment
and
ensure
that
the
port
waters
are
clean

scrubbers
in

port
waters
will
be
prohibited
said
andrew
tan
chief
executive
officer
of
the
mpa
during
an
event
in
singapore
ships
fitted
with
hybrid
scrubbers
will
be
required
to
switch
to
the
mode
of
operation
tan
said
singapore
is
the
world
s
biggest
hub
for
ship
refueling
also
known
as
bunkering
tan
said
singapore
would
provide
facilities
for
the
collection
of
residue
generated
from
the
operation
of
scrubbers
the
mpa
said
the
ban
would
be
enforced
from
under
future
imo
rules
ships
will
have
to
reduce
the
sulfur
content
in
their
fuel
to
below
percent
from
compared
with
percent
now
to
do
so
shippers
can
switch
to
burning
cleaner
oil
shift
to
alternative
fuels
like
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
or
invest
in
exhaust
gas
cleaning
systems
or
scrubbers
the
mpa
s
move
could
be
a
setback
for
shippers
bunkering
in
singapore
that
have
invested
in
scrubbers
scrubbers
use
seawater
to
capture
sulfur
from
engine
exhausts
before
discharging
this
wash
water
back
into
the
ocean
after
treatment
in
systems
scrubbing
is
performed
using
water
treated
with
additives
recycling
the
liquid
internally
hybrid
scrubbers
are
a
combination
of
both
the
cheapest
of
the
scrubbing
options
systems
have
been
the
most
popular
with
shippers
shipping
sources
say
some
anticipate
singapore
s
move
could
cost
the
business
in
the
bunkering
industry
singapore
s
bunker
market
could
lose
out
to
competitive
bunkering
locations
emerging
in
surrounding
locations
provided
they
allow
scrubbers
to
operate
said
ashok
sharma
managing
director
of
shipbroker
brs
baxi
in
singapore
others
are
less
concerned
since
most
shippers
are
opting
for
low
sulfur
fuels
as
a
means
for
compliance
and
the
benefits
of
scrubbers
are
largely
realized
in
open
water
and
not
within
port
limits
prudent
tanker
owners
will
have
likely
factored
in
the
possibility
of
limits
on
the
use
of
scrubbers
said
tim
wilkins
manager
for
intertanko
an
association
of
independent
tanker
owners
and
operators
while
recent
interest
in
scrubbers
has
increased
the
cost
of
installing
them
and
uncertainty
around
emissions
regulations
has
meant
that
a
switch
to
fuels
remains
the
most
practical
form
of
compliance
with
imo
rules

to
industry
