reuters
the
state
department
will
conduct
another
environmental
review
of
transcanada
corp
s
keystone
xl
oil
pipeline
a
official
said
on
friday
a
move
that
could
lead
to
additional
delays
of
the
project
the
supplemental
environmental
impact
statement
was
ordered
by
judge
brian
morris
of
the
district
court
in
montana
in
his
ruling
on
that
blocked
construction
of
the
pipeline
planned
to
bring
heavy
crude
from
canada
s
oil
sands
to
the
united
states
morris
said
in
his
ruling
that
previous
environmental
analysis
of
keystone
xl
fell
short
of
a
hard
look
at
the
cumulative
effects
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
the
impact
on
native
american
land
resources
the
billion
pipeline
which
is
supported
by
canadian
oil
interests
and
refiners
but
opposed
by
landowners
and
environmentalists
has
been
pending
for
a
decade
president
donald
trump
announced
a
permit
for
the
project
soon
after
he
took
office
former
president
barack
obama
nixed
the
pipeline
saying
it
would
do
little
to
help
consumers
and
would
add
greenhouse
gases
transcanada
spokesman
terry
cunha
said
that
the
state
department
s
announcement
of
an
additional
review
was
expected
after
the
judge
s
ruling
earlier
this
week
transcanada
asked
morris
the
district
court
judge
to
allow
it
to
resume
some
activities
blocked
by
the
initial
ruling
morris
decision
on
thursday
gave
the
calgary
company
permission
to
resume
some
activity
on
the
pipeline
project
including
project
development
work
and
stakeholder
meetings
it
is
not
allowed
to
resume
physical
field
work
like
moving
pipe
and
equipment
preparing
work
camp
sites
or
undertaking
road
upgrades
at
this
time
cunha
said
morris
is
set
to
rule
on
that
work
after
it
is
too
soon
to
say
what
the
injunction
will
mean
to
the
timeline
of
the
keystone
xl
pipeline
but
we
remain
confident
the
project
will
be
built
