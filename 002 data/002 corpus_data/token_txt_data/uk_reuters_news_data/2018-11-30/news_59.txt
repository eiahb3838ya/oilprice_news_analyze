asian
shares
wavered
on
friday
as
investors
were
on
edge
before
a
crucial
weekend
meeting
between
the
chinese
and
presidents
that
could
determine
the
course
of
a
heated
trade
war
over
the
next
year
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
wobbled
between
positive
and
negative
territory
in
early
trade
as
more
evidence
of
a
slowdown
in
china
dampened
sentiment
it
was
last
up
less
than
percent
and
has
risen
percent
for
the
week
so
far
largely
reflecting
a
rebound
from
a
recent
steep
in
japan
the
nikkei
was
up
percent
while
korean
shares
dropped
percent
after
the
country
s
central
bank
lifted
its
policy
interest
rate
in
a
widely
expected
decision
chinese
advanced
percent
despite
a
survey
showing
china
s
factory
growth
stalled
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
two
years
in
november
the
weak
manufacturing
growth
reinforced
expectations
that
beijing
will
roll
out
more
economic
support
measures
a
factor
that
has
helped
to
prop
up
battered
chinese
stocks
recently
investor
attention
is
now
squarely
focussed
on
planned
talks
between
chinese
president
xi
jinping
and
his
counterpart
over
the
weekend
on
the
sidelines
of
a
summit

the

and
the

dropped

on
thursday
adding
to
apprehension
ahead
of
the
meeting
were
comments
from
a
official
who
said
white
house
trade
adviser
peter
navarro
who
has
advocated
a
tougher
trade
stance
with
china
would
attend
the
mixed
signals
from
washington
about
the
prospects
for
a
rapprochement
with
china
on
trade
kept
investors
on
the
sidelines
rather
than
jump
at
headlines
the
market
has
taken
a
approach
and
prices
are
treading
water
until
we
see
the
outcome
analysts
at

said
in
a

investment
analyst

securities
in

global
investors
also
remain
hesitant
to
shift
positions
significantly
as
they
seek
clarity
on
federal
reserve
policy
direction
minutes
of
the
latest
fed
policy
meeting
showed
that
almost
all
officials
agreed
another
interest
rate
increase
was
likely
to
be
warranted
fairly
soon
but
opened
debate
on
when
to
pause
further
hikes
and
how
to
relay
those
plans
to
the
public
the
minutes
follow
comments
from

jerome
powell
earlier
this
week
that
some
took
as
indicating
a
