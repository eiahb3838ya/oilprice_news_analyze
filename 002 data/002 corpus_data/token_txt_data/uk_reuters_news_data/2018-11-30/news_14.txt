update 1-u.s. agency lifts 2019 biofuels mandate, drawing mixed reaction
washington
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
on
friday
lifted
its
annual
blending
mandate
for
advanced
biofuels
drawing
praise
from
the
biofuels
industry
but
disappointment
that
the
government
had
not
done
more
to
protect
the
agricultural
market
under
the
renewable
fuel
standard
oil
refiners
must
blend
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
into
their
fuel
each
year
or
purchase
blending
credits
from
those
that
do
the
epa
on
friday
lifted
its
requirement
for
advanced
biofuels
by
percent
for
while
keeping
the
volume
for
conventional
biofuels
like
ethanol
steady
the
figures
were
the
same
as
reported
by
reuters
on
thursday
ahead
of
the
official
release
in
an
article
citing
an
internal
agency
document
republican
senator
chuck
grassley
from
farm
state
iowa
welcomed
the
increase
in
the
advanced
biofuels
requirement
but
slammed
the
epa
for
its
refusal
to
reallocate
biofuel
volumes
that
had
been
previously
waived
under
the
small
refinery
exemptions
program
one
of
the
most
controversial
issues
dividing
the
corn
lobby
and
the
oil
industry
i
m
disappointed
the
rule
didn
t
reallocate
waived
volumes
to
make
up
for
the
damage
done
by
former
administrator
pruitt
grassley
said
in
a
statement
small
refineries
can
be
exempted
from
the
rfs
if
they
prove
that
complying
would
cause
them
financial
strain
since
president
donald
trump
s
election
and
under
the
former
epa
administrator
scott
pruitt
who
stepped
down
in
july
the
epa
has
vastly
expanded
the
number
of
waivers
it
has
handed
out
to
small
refineries
in
a
bid
to
reduce
the
refining
industry
s
regulatory
compliance
costs
the
move
has
infuriated
the
farmbelt
which
argues
the
program
erodes
demand
for
biofuels
the
latest
epa
rule
is
a
missed
opportunity
to
correctly
account
for
billions
of
gallons
of
ethanol
lost
to
refinery
exemptions
growth
energy
ceo
emily
skor
said
in
a
statement
until
these
are
addressed
properly
we
re
still
taking
two
steps
back
for
every
step
but
recently
signs
have
emerged
of
a
potential
shift
the
trump
administration
has
temporarily
put
on
hold
the
processing
of
current
waiver
applications
as
the
epa
and
the
department
of
energy
review
the
scoring
system
used
to
evaluate
them
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
this
week
senator
grassley
said
he
was
glad
the
epa
could
revisit
the
practice
citing
a
meeting
with
acting
epa
administrator
andrew
wheeler
on
thursday
over
the
issue
the
handling
of
these
applications
is
ripe
for
review
there
s
no
good
reason
oil
companies
making
billions
of
dollars
in
profits
should
be
exempted
from
following
the
law
as
passed
and
intended
by
congress
he
said
the
mandate
here
includes
billion
gallons
for
advanced
biofuels
up
from
the
epa
initial
proposal
in
june
of
billion
and
above
the
billion
that
had
been
set
for
the
epa
said
the
requirement
for
conventional
biofuels
remains
at
billion
gallons
for
on
par
with
and
the
same
as
proposed
by
the
agency
in
june
