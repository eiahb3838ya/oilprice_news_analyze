madrid
banned
most
petrol
and
diesel
cars
from
the
heart
of
the
city
on
friday
as
it
tries
to
improve
the
air
quality
in
one
of
europe
s
most
polluted
capitals
police
patrolled
dozens
of
access
points
to
the
almost
sq
km
sq
miles
area
including
the
gran
via
avenue
and
puerta
del
sol
square
teeming
with
tourists
to
block
all
cars
expect
those
with
exemptions
or
that
were
electric
or
grinding
traffic
jams
and
a
lot
of
older
or
diesel
vehicles
plus
a
frequently
windless
dry
climate
have
contributed
to
the
high
levels
of
nitrogen
dioxide
in
madrid
that
have
been
in
violation
of
european
regulations
since
madrid
authorities
hope
to
catch
up
with
other
european
capitals
such
as
london
paris
berlin
or
oslo
that
are
already
imposing
traffic
restrictions
to
improve
the
air
quality
however
the
plan
may
fall
apart
before
it
is
fully
implemented
if
the
conservative
opposition
popular
party
which
argues
that
the
administrative
procedure
of
adopting
the
new
rules
was
flawed
has
its
way
after
challenging
it
in
court
ines
sabanes
in
charge
of
and
mobility
at
the
madrid
city
hall
said
the
city
would
press
ahead
with
measures
we
can
t
afford
it
inversion
of
environment
policies
neither
can
the
cities
nor
the
health
of
the
planet
she
said
traffic
was
heavy
on
friday
around
the
perimeter
of
the
new
exclusion
zone
with
cars
honking
loudly
but
it
was
little
different
from
any
other
day
as
cars
without
the
permits
appeared
to
steer
clear
of
the
area
critics
say
the
rules
have
multiple
complex
exceptions
that
could
undermine
the
plan
s
efficiency
for
instance
residents
of
the
central
area
can
drive
any
kind
of
cars
including
older
diesel
cars
and
so
can
property
owners
even
if
they
are
not
residents
all
motorcycles
are
allowed
during
police
will
enforce
the
restrictions
for
the
first
few
months
without
applying
fines
but
in
march
a
computer
system
is
due
to
fully
assume
control
and
fine
potential
violators
i
am
very
happy
with
these
measures
because
i
think
they
are
going
to
clean
the
air
in
the
centre
of
the
city

student
in
his
who
usually
uses
public
transport
to
access
the
area
