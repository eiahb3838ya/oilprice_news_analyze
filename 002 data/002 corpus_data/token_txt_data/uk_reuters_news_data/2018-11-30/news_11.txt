libya
s
oil
output
is
at
a
high
and
rare
exploration
deals
with
foreign
majors
are
being
won
but
worker
dissent
and
armed
groups
risk
a
repeat
of
disruptions
that
have
choked
off
other
production
surges
since
the
civil
war
staff
at
state
oil
firm
noc
told
reuters
that
small
protests
had
erupted
at
nine
oil
and
gas
fields
and
some
ports
in
recent
months
mainly
among
workers
left
waiting
for
promised
pay
rises
as
inflation
and
a
weak
currency
erode
living
standards
we
are
the
anonymous
soldiers
whose
rights
have
been
stolen
said
a
worker
at
the
oil
field
asking
not
to
be
named
as
noc
has
banned
workers
from
talking
to
the
media
we
should
be
the
best
paid
workers
in
libya
but
we
suffer
from
poor
accommodation
and
medical
treatment
in
the
fields
and
delays
in
salary
other
staff
made
similar
comments
the
most
stable
period
of
production
in
the
north
african
country
since
has
pushed
output
as
high
as
million
barrels
per
day
noc
has
restarted
wells
shut
for
years
as
security
has
improved
in
some
areas
while
oil
majors
like
bp
have
said
they
will
revive
exploration
plans
but
approaching
or
exceeding
output
of
million
bpd
has
tended
to
be
a
psychological
trigger
for
demands
from
workers
and
militia
groups
that
also
want
a
share
of
oil
earnings
in
autumn
blockades
of
oilfields
and
ports
rapidly
cut
production
after
it
had
climbed
to
more
than
bpd
in
may
disruptions
slashed
output
to
around
bpd
its
lowest
since
the
war
before
libya
was
producing
around
million
bpd
seven
years
after
muammar
gaddafi
was
toppled
the
opec
member
also
remains
mired
in
conflict
between
rival
governments
and
armed
groups
noc
said
in
a
statement
it
had
called
on
the
government
to
approve
a
pay
rise
and
would
continue
to
mediate
on
behalf
of
the
sector
for
the
improved
financial
rewards
and
conditions
that
employees
deserve
but
years
of
underfunding
and
destruction
by
militias
had
forced
it
to
focus
on
damaged
infrastructure
noc
is
constantly
having
to
redeploy
budget
to
restore
critical
infrastructure
funds
that
could
otherwise
be
spent
on
facilities
and
improving
working
conditions
it
said
the
threat
to
libyan
oil
and
gas
production
is
not
from
staff
but
from
blockaders
fuel
smugglers
and
others
seeking
to
extort
from
the
libya
was
once
one
of
africa
s
richest
countries
but
living
standards
for
ordinary
citizens
have
declined
as
the
local
currency
has
lost
value
the
dinar
has
dived
on
the
parallel
market
against
the
dollar
since
since
even
basic
foodstuffs
like
milk
have
to
be
imported
inflation
has
soared
hurting
oil
workers
whose
salaries
have
not
risen
since
authorities
then
agreed
a
percent
pay
increase
but
volatile
oil
revenues
meant
it
was
never
implemented
priced
for
its
proximity
to
key
european
markets
and
crude
quality
libyan
oil
has
recently
been
in
demand
as
a
substitute
for
iranian
crude
hit
by
sanctions
part
of
the
technical
work
needed
to
keep
oil
and
gas
fields
going
is
done
by
noc
s
foreign
partners
and
specialist
services
firms
an
oil
executive
said
but
noc
staff
need
to
be
kept
happy
as
they
make
up
the
bulk
of
the
industry
s
workforce
operate
oil
export
ports
and
are
often
alone
at
remote
fields
where
poor
security
makes
oil
majors
wary
of
sending
their
own
staff
oil
workers
protests
have
been
small
and
shortlived
but
in
libya
with
its
dysfunctional
state
pipelines
have
sometimes
been
blocked
by
or
fewer
people
industry
sources
said
many
libyans
see
noc
which
generates
billions
of
dollars
annually
as
a
cash
cow
that
is
potentially
more
responsive
to
their
grievances
than
the
largely
absent
state
armed
groups
have
also
enjoyed
an
oil
bonanza
by
forcing
the
weak
state
to
hire
their
men
they
gain
access
to
cheap
central
bank
dollars
to
sell
on
the
black
market
at
a
premium
one
such
group
the
petroleum
facilities
guards
pfg
is
in
charge
of
securing
facilities
in
september
some
pfg
members
halted
air
transport
to
the
wafa
oil
field
in
what
noc
said
was
an
attempt
to
extract
a
corrupt
contract
noc
workers
make
between
dinars
and
dinars
a
month
more
than
the
average
public
servant
but
frustration
has
been
building
up
over
a
lack
of
investment
in
living
quarters
or
medical
units
in
september
oil
workers
at
noc
s
eastern
zueitina
port
demanded
health
insurance
in
a
letter
to
management
noc
said
it
had
approved
medical
coverage
for
all
staff
last
year
and
instructed
subsidiaries
to
proceed
with
the
policy
after
the
audit
bureau
suspended
health
insurance
in
other
staff
are
tired
of
having
to
work
in
dangerous
places
such
as
the
el
sharara
oilfield
deep
in
the
south
where
gunmen
have
kidnapped
or
robbed
workers
the
security
situation
on
the
el
sharara
field
is
very
dangerous
said
one
frightened
engineer
tribesmen
have
threatened
to
close
the
field
unless
they
get
a
share
of
oil
revenues
a
recurring
theme
while
libya
is
divided
between
rival
governments
relying
on
armed
groups
and
tribes
libya
needs
a
comprehensive
political
settlement
before
situations
like
the
one
we
have
at
sharara
can
be
resolved
a
libyan
oil
source
said
noc
hopes
to
increase
production
further
if
security
improves
but
analysts
remain
sceptical
with
production
at
a
high
the
production
risks
are
more
on
the
downside
considering
the
ongoing
political
instability
in
the
country
and
the
challenging
security
situation
