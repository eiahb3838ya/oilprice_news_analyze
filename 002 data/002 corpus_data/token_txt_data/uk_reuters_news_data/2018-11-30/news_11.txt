poll-slowing demand and a supply glut to drain oil's gains in 2019
reuters
oil
analysts
are
increasingly
pessimistic
about
the
prospect
of
a
price
rally
next
year
when
the
outlook
for
demand
is
uncertain
and
supply
is
growing
at
breakneck
speed
even
though
the
market
expects
opec
to
cut
output
a
reuters
poll
showed
a
survey
of
economists
and
analysts
forecast
brent
crude
to
average
a
barrel
in
lower
than
the
outlook
last
month
the
poll
predicted
brent
would
average
in
mostly
in
line
with
the
average
for
the
global
benchmark
so
far
this
year
in
the
first
half
of
next
year
we
expect
upward
price
pressure
resulting
from
opec
production
cuts
said
adri√†
morron
salmeron
economist
at
caixabank
research
then
we
expect
downward
price
pressures
from
an
uptick
in
shale
production
in
the
second
half
as
bottlenecks
will
disappear
and
a
deceleration
of
global
of
the
contributors
who
participated
in
both
the
october
and
november
polls
cut
their
average
price
forecast
for
brent
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
as
well
as
russia
and
other
producers
meet
in
vienna
on
in
an
attempt
to
support
crude
prices
which
have
fallen
by
over
percent
from
early
october
s
high
of
the
group
could
announce
cuts
of
anywhere
between
and
million
barrels
per
day
analysts
said
the
oil
market
is
definitely
oversupplied
at
the
moment
therefore
opec
will
decide
to
cut
output
in
december
said
frank
schallenberger
head
of
commodity
research
at
lbbw
the
recent
drop
in
prices
was
so
strong
that
i
think
the
members
will
either
agree
to
freeze
production
or
join
in
the
a
slowing
global
economy
could
erode
oil
demand
growth
next
year
when
supply
from
countries
is
forecast
to
expand
at
a
record
pace
citi
had
the
lowest
forecast
for
brent
at
a
barrel
while
abn
amro
and
raymond
james
had
the
highest
at
the
decision
to
grant
waivers
to
countries
that
buy
crude
from
iran
hit
by
sanctions
on
its
energy
exports
has
changed
the
dynamics
in
a
market
already
under
pressure
from
soaring
output
from
the
world
s
top
three
oil
producers
the
united
states
russia
and
saudi
arabia
analysts
said
uncertainty
over
sanctions
against
iran
had
made
the
market
fixated
with
supply
the
waivers
changed
the
arithmetic
raising
the
possibility
of
a
supply
glut
developing
in
said
konstantinos
venetis
senior
economist
at
tsl
research
output
could
rise
by
to
million
bpd
in
led
by
shale
a
few
of
the
analysts
said
sharp
increases
in
production
will
be
a
key
impediment
in
upside
potential
for
oil
prices
in
said
benjamin
lu
commodities
analyst
at
phillip
futures
the
poll
forecast
light
crude
to
average
a
barrel
in
down
from
predicted
in
the
previous
poll
the
contract
has
averaged
about
so
far
in
adding
to
the
possible
glut
was
a
recovery
in
output
from
nigeria
and
libya
excluded
from
previous
cuts
because
of
production
declines
caused
by
unrest
on
the
other
hand
oil
demand
was
seen
growing
by
between
and
million
bpd
in
compared
with
to
million
bpd
projected
in
the
previous
month
s
poll
on
the
demand
side
the
main
driver
is
the
question
how
far
worldwide
economic
growth
will
slow
in
and
how
far
this
will
lead
to
lower
dynamics
of
oil
demand
next
year
