after trump calls, gulf opec members cover most of iran oil loss - reuters survey
london
reuters
opec
oil
supply
has
fallen
in
november
from
a
high
due
to
sanctions
on
iran
a
reuters
survey
found
although
most
of
the
output
gap
left
by
iran
was
plugged
by
saudi
arabia
and
the
uae
in
response
to
calls
from
president
donald
trump
the
organisation
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
has
pumped
million
barrels
per
day
this
month
the
survey
on
friday
found
down
bpd
from
october
which
was
the
highest
by
opec
as
a
group
since
december
the
survey
adds
to
indications
that
opec
output
remains
ample
despite
sanctions
imposed
on
iran
this
month
oil
prices
have
slid
percent
since
early
october
on
worries
a
new
glut
may
emerge
opec
and
its
allies
including
russia
meet
on
in
vienna
to
discuss
cutting
supply
with
saudi
arabia
and
russia
pumping
at
record
rates
output
surging
and
forecasts
pointing
to
lower
demand
in
due
to
a
slowing
economy
some
analysts
are
sceptical
the
producers
will
avoid
generating
a
surplus
the
most
likely
outcome
of
next
week
s
opec
meeting
is
a
fudge
said
stephen
brennock
of
oil
broker
pvm
russia
and
saudi
arabia
will
agree
to
curb
production
but
by
less
than
is
needed
to
prevent
a
supply
imbalance
in
early
opec
russia
and
other
agreed
in
june
to
return
to
percent
compliance
with
output
cuts
that
began
in
january
after
months
of
underproduction
in
venezuela
and
angola
that
had
pushed
adherence
above
percent
in
november
the
opec
members
bound
by
the
agreement
boosted
compliance
to
percent
as
production
fell
in
iran
from
a
revised
percent
in
october
the
survey
found
the
biggest
drop
in
opec
supply
this
month
has
come
from
iran
according
to
the
survey
exports
fell
at
times
below
million
bpd
as
returning
sanctions
discouraged
companies
from
buying
iranian
oil
although
volumes
rose
later
in
the
month
sources
in
the
survey
said
sanctions
waivers
granted
to
eight
buyers
could
lead
to
higher
exports
in
december
analysts
have
said
the
decline
was
in
iraq
where
exports
from
southern
iraqi
terminals
were
curbed
by
bad
weather
despite
the
resumption
of
some
kirkuk
exports
in
the
north
after
a
one
year
halt
there
were
small
falls
in
production
in
libya
and
nigeria
both
exempt
from
the
supply
pact
opec
is
discussing
including
one
or
both
of
the
african
producers
in
a
supply
deal
the
biggest
rise
was
in
saudi
arabia
where
supply
hit
a
record
million
bpd
trump
has
been
urging
saudi
arabia
and
other
producers
to
pump
more
oil
to
curb
rising
prices
and
make
up
for
losses
from
iran
uae
output
rose
following
a
jump
in
october
reaching
million
bpd
the
uae
says
its
capacity
will
reach
million
bpd
by
the
supply
to
market
unexpectedly
rose
in
venezuela
as
two
reported
a
rise
in
exports
which
have
been
declining
for
months
due
to
the
country
s
economic
crisis
before
congo
joined
opec
this
year
the
group
had
an
implied
production
target
for
of
million
bpd
based
on
cutbacks
detailed
in
late
and
nigeria
and
libya
s
expectations
of
output
opec
excluding
congo
pumped
almost
exactly
that
amount
in
