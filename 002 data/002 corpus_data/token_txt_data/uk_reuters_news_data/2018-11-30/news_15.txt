oil
toiled
at
a
more
than
low
after
its
worst
month
in
a
decade
on
friday
while
most
major
markets
were
keeping
moves
tight
ahead
of
a
weekend
meeting
between
and
chinese
presidents
donald
trump
and
xi
jinping
europe
s
main
share
indexes
in
london
frankfurt
and
paris
all
started
their
day
lower
after
the
latest
batch
of
disappointing
chinese
data
had
made
for
another
twitchy
asian
session
overnight
frankfurt
s
dax
and
britain
s
mainly
ftse
were
both
staring
at
their
fourth
consecutive
month
of
falls
for
the
dax
it
is
its
worst
run
since
the
back
end
of
the
real
humdingers
though
have
been
oil
and
apple
which
have
plunged
percent
and
percent
respectively
in
november
the
worst
month
for
either
since
the
financial
crisis
a
decade
ago
expectations
at
the
start
of
the
fourth
quarter
were
for
a
in
risky
assets
but
two
of
the
biggest
trends
have
been
a
reversal
of
some
of
the
few
returns
we
have
seen
this
year
which
have
been
in
oil
and
in
tech
said

strategy
at

michael
metcalfe
also
the
market
seems
to
be
going
into
the
meeting
with
very
low
expectations
of
a
ceasefire
in
the
trade
war
that
may
very
well
be
correct
but
politics
has
proved
very
hard
to
predict
this
anticipation
ahead
of
that
meeting
ensured
cautious
moves
in
the
currency
and
bond
markets
the
dollar
index
was
a
touch
firmer
at
having
slipped
this
back
this
week
after
federal
reserve
chief
jerome
powell
left
investors
wondering
whether
the
central
bank

data
on

added
to
the
anticipation
showing
that
growth
in
china
s
vast
manufacturing
sector
had
stalled
this
month
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
two
years
this
is
not
a
good
year
for

a
german
government
source
told
reuters
about
the
prospects
for
a
statement
at
the
end
of
the

rates
in
a
widely
expected
decision

the

percent
higher
while
chinese
which
have
had
a
relatively
steady
month
all
considered
also
advanced

himself
had
sent
mixed
signals
saying
i
think
we
re
very
close
to
doing
something
with
china
but
i
don
t
know
that
i
want
to
do
it
as
the

so
lucrative
