more than 40 pct of world coal plants are unprofitable -report
london
reuters
more
than
percent
of
the
world
s
coal
plants
are
operating
at
a
loss
due
to
high
fuel
costs
and
that
proportion
could
to
rise
to
nearly
percent
by
a
report
by
environmental
carbon
tracker
showed
on
friday
institutional
investors
are
increasingly
divesting
from
fossil
fuel
companies
due
to
the
risk
their
assets
will
become
stranded
as
tougher
emissions
cut
targets
discourage
their
use
and
renewable
energy
becomes
even
cheaper
carbon
tracker
analysed
the
profitability
of
coal
plants
around
the
world
representing
percent
of
operating
capacity
and
percent
of
capacity
under
construction
it
found
that
percent
of
global
coal
capacity
is
already
unprofitable
from
onwards
it
expects
falling
renewable
energy
costs
air
pollution
regulations
and
carbon
pricing
to
result
in
further
cost
pressures
and
make
around
percent
of
the
fleet
cashflow
negative
by
in
addition
by
new
wind
and
solar
will
be
cheaper
than
continuing
to
operate
percent
of
today
s
existing
and
planned
coal
plants
the
report
said
our
analysis
shows
a
power
system
without
coal
should
be
seen
as
an
economic
inevitability
rather
than
a
clean
and
green
nicety
said
sebastian
ljungwaldh
energy
analyst
at
carbon
tracker
and
of
the
report
on
sunday
almost
countries
will
meet
katowice
poland
one
of
the
most
polluted
regions
in
europe
to
agree
on
the
rules
for
implementing
a
landmark
deal
to
cut
carbon
emissions
called
the
paris
agreement
efforts
are
underway
across
the
world
to
curb
global
warming
by
using
more
renewable
energy
and
burning
less
fossil
fuels
such
as
coal
and
oil
to
produce
power
but
emissions
are
still
rising
a
report
in
october
said
the
share
of
power
in
the
global
energy
mix
would
need
to
be
cut
to
under
percent
by
to
keep
global
temperature
rises
within
safe
limits
in
several
economies
governments
will
have
to
choose
between
closing
plants
subsidising
coal
generation
and
power
prices
or
increasing
power
prices
to
make
coal
viable
which
will
hurt
consumers
and
undermine
competitiveness
carbon
tracker
said
by
phasing
out
coal
globally
by
stranded
asset
risk
worth
billion
billion
pounds
could
be
avoided
