depressed
canadian
oil
prices
are
forcing
energy
companies
to
use
their
shares
as
a
currency
to
fund
acquisitions
but
investors
have
been
hard
to
win
over
to
the
strategy
unusually
large
price
discounts
for
canadian
crude
due
to
clogged
pipelines
and
faltering
global
prices
have
made
growth
hard
to
realize
some
producers
have
reduced
output
and
lower
cash
flow
has
left
consolidation
using
stock
as
the
main
option
shares
of
encana
corp
baytex
energy
corp
and
international
petroleum
corp
for
examples
each
plummeted
by
on
the
days
they
announced
deals
to
buy
rivals
with
shares
the
tsx
energy
index
performed
better
on
those
days
although
it
has
been
in
steep
decline
since
early
october
we
ve
been
getting
shocked
with
bad
news
all
year
and
investors
don
t
necessarily
believe
that
consolidation
is
a
big
enough
catalyst
to
offset
all
the
macro
headwinds
said
kevin
brent
of
investment
for
bluesky
equities
which
owns
shares
in
seven
generations
energy
and
crescent
point
energy
canadian
oil
producers
face
a
dwindling
amount
of
capital
willing
to
invest
in
the
sector
leaving
many
with
a
stark
choice
said
eric
nuttal
senior
portfolio
manager
at
ninepoint
partners
which
owns
shares
in
meg
energy
baytex
and
athabasca
oil
do
you
increase
in
scale
and
get
your
market
cap
above
billion
to
get
on
the
radar
screen
or
do
you
just
throw
in
the
towel
many
are
scaling
up
the
result
nuttall
said
will
likely
be
more
deals
into
early
and
a
shrinking
number
of
canadian
oil
producers
in
the
long
term
the
canadian
oil
patch
has
made
deals
so
far
in
the
second
half
worth
billion
the
busiest
period
for
deals
since
the
first
half
of
according
to
cormark
securities
data
further
deals
may
have
to
rely
on
shares
and
private
equity
said
andy
mah
ceo
of
advantage
oil
gas
when
you
get
into
a
period
of
such
volatility
i
think
any
kind
of
m
a
is
very
difficult
because
revenues
are
certainly
shareholders
are
mainly
interested
in
companies
that
pay
dividends
or
buy
back
shares
said
cormark
analyst
amir
arif
it
s
almost
like
you
can
t
win
if
you
re
a
canadian
energy
company
said
janan
paskaran
a
partner
at
torys
llp
who
provides
m
a
advice
to
energy
companies
it
s
hard
to
invest
within
canada
and
it
s
tough
to
get
investor
support
when
you
expand
people
are
saying
let
s
not
spend
any
on
tuesday
trinidad
drilling
shareholders
rejected
a
friendly
stock
deal
to
sell
to
precision
drilling
corp
choosing
instead
the
certainty
of
a
cash
offer
from
ensign

ipc
s
shares
have
traded
more
in
line
with
the
industry
since
the
steep
last
month
when
it
announced
its
purchase
of
blackpearl
resources
and
investors
generally
support
the
deal
said
ceo
mike
nicholson
we
re
now
well
positioned
for
the
recovery
over
the
next
two
to
three
years
nicholson
said
in
an
interview
from
geneva
should
we
start
to
see
canadian
pipelines
and
improve
i
think
there
s
a
huge
amount
of
upside
now
in
our
share
