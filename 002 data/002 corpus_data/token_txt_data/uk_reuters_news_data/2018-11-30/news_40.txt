a
summit
of
the
world
s
top
economies
will
open
on
friday
with
leaders
struggling
over
fallout
from
a
trade
war
that
has
roiled
global
markets
and
bracing
for
the
kind
of
divisive
geopolitical
drama
that
president
donald
trump
often
brings
to
the
international
stage
the
annual
gathering
will
be
a
major
test
for
the
group
of
industrialized
nations
whose
leaders
first
met
in
to
help
rescue
the
global
economy
from
the
worst
financial
crisis
in
seven
decades
but
which
now
faces
questions
over
its
relevance
to
deal
with
the
latest
round
of
crises
overhanging
the
summit
in
buenos
aires
the
argentine
capital
is
a
bitter
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
which
have
imposed
tariffs
on
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
of
each
other
s
imports
all
eyes
will
be
on
a
planned
meeting
between
trump
and
chinese
president
xi
jinping
on
saturday
to
see
whether
they
can
find
a
way
to
calm
the
waters
and
make
progress
toward
resolving
differences
that
threaten
the
global
economy
on
the
eve
of
the
summit
member
nations
were
still
racing
to
reach
agreement
on
major
issues
including
trade
migration
and
climate
change
that
in
past
years
have
been
worked
out
well
in
advance
those
divisions
have
highlighted
the
fractures
in
the
grouping
in
fact
trump
s
skepticism
that
global
warming
is
caused
by
human
activity
has
even
raised
questions
about
whether
the
countries
will
be
able
to
reach
enough
consensus
on
the
issue
to
include
it
in
the
summit
s
final
communique
further
clouding
the
summit
is
the
escalation
of
conflict
between
russia
and
ukraine
a
topic
that
will
be
on
many
leaders
minds
when
they
see
russian
president
vladimir
putin
there
are
also
questions
about
how
to
handle
the
awkward
presence
of

de
facto
ruler

controversy
over
the
murder
of

journalist
jamal
khashoggi
in
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
in

uncertainty
prevailed
about
how
trump
known
for
his
unpredictability
would
behave
at
what
was
shaping
up
as
one
of
the
group
s
most
consequential
summits
