diversification
efforts
the
state

said
on
friday
by
transferring
lng
to
more
conventional
tankers
in
norway
the
arctic

cut
in
half
the
distance
they
would

enabling
more
frequent
shipments
from
the
novatek

at
a

additional

we
are

by
promoting

the

added
the
united
states
has
been
pressing
europe
to
cut
its
reliance
on
cheap
russian
gas
and
buy
much
more
expensive

european

have
so

resisted
