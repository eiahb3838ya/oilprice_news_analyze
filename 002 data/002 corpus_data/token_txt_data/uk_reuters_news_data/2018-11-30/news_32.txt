bulgaria
will
go
ahead
with
plans
to
spend
billion
euros
billion
to
build
a
new
gas
link
to
turkey
to
transport
russian
gas
from
the
turkstream
pipeline
to
europe
bypassing
ukraine
to
the
south
bulgarian
lawmakers
gave
the
green
light
to
the
state
gas
company
bulgartransgaz
to
launch
tenders
to
build
a
new
gas
link
that
will
carry
mainly
russian
natural
gas
turkstream
is
part
of
the
kremlin
s
plans
to
bypass
ukraine
currently
the
main
transit
route
for
russian
gas
to
europe
and
strengthen
its
position
in
the
european
market
its
two
lines
will
each
have
an
annual
capacity
of
billion
cubic
metres
russian
energy
giant
gazprom
has
completed
the
first
line
of
pipeline
to
turkey
for
local
gas
consumption
gazprom
said
on
friday
it
was
considering
booking
capacity
which
would
effectively
ensure
that
the
gas
russia
plans
to
send
to
europe
through
its
black
sea
pipeline
will
pass
through
its
land
the
news
comes
at
a
time
of
increased
tensions
between
russia
and
ukraine
and
sofia
is
concerned
that
the
conflict
may
once
again
put
the
brakes
on
russia
s
plans
to
ship
gas
through
bulgaria
to
europe
bypassing
kiev
what
follows
from
now
on
is
strict
observation
of
european
union
rules
and
procedures
so
that
we
can
eliminate
all
eventual
mistakes
that
in
the
past
have
led
to
the
cancellation
of
south
stream
energy
minister
temenuzhka
petkova
said
bulgaria
is
still
smarting
from
the
cancellation
of
russia
s
plan
to
bring
gas
to
its
shores
with
its
south
stream
pipeline
the
project
which
had
promised
the
balkan
country
on
the
european
union
s
periphery
money
and
clout
was
dropped
by
russia
after
it
blamed
opposition
from
brussels
at
present
gazprom
transports
about
billion
of
cubic
meters
bcm
of
gas
a
year
to
turkey
via
bulgaria
through
a
contract
that
runs
through
bulgaria
is
ready
to
give
up
on
its
option
in
the
current
contract
if
it
gets
a
new
deal
to
transport
russian
gas
through
the
new
pipeline
and
says
its
net
profit
for
the
period
could
be
as
much
as
billion
euros
brussels
has
been
concerned
that
bulgaria
may
opt
to
simply
send
russian
gas
onto
europe
to
earn
transit
fees
rather
than
allowing
it
to
be
traded
at
its
planned
balkan
gas
hub
cementing
its
almost
complete
dependence
on
gazprom
some
energy
experts
have
also
voiced
concerns
that
bulgaria
is
rushing
too
quickly
with
projects
linked
to
russian
gas
and
dragging
its
feet
with
plans
to
develop
gas
links
that
would
allow
diversification
in
a
bid
to
ease
such
concerns
sofia
says
the
new
pipeline
will
be
built
in
line
with
eu
energy
rules
bulgaria
s
parliament
voted
that
bulgartransgaz
should
set
up
a
gas
trading
bourse
and
take
a
percent
stake
in
a
liquefied
natural
gas
terminal
off
the
coast
in
northern
greece
