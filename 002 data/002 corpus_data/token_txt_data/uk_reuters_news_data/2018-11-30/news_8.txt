children
who
are
too
young

are
demanding
more
action
on
climate
change
as
world
leaders
gather
at
a
major
summit
in
poland
this
week
we
will
be
the
main
victims
of
climate
change
it
will
be
our
generation
who
suffer
the
consequences
said
sydney
student
aisheeya
huq
who
skipped
school
on
friday
to
protest
along
with
tens
of
thousands
of
children
across
australia
the
nationwide

were
inspired
by
stockholm
student
greta
thunberg
who
misses
school
every
friday
to
demonstrate
outside
sweden
s
parliament
she
plans
to
do
so
until
the
country
reaches
its
ambitious
goals
to
curb
carbon
emissions
it
s
amazing
that
kids
are
protesting
and
they
are
making
their
voices
heard
this
is
our
last
chance
we
can
t
mess
this
up
thunberg
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
climate
organisations
and
actions
are
springing
up
around
the
globe
their
desire
for
change
stems
from
personal
experience
of
and
worry
about
climate
change
as
well
as
a
desire
to
hold
their
governments
to
account
their
members
say
half
the
world
s
population
is
now
under
years
old
and
are
increasingly
vocal
on
political
and
social
issues
with
climate
change
the
biggest
concern
for
youths
from
countries
according
to
a
world
economic
forum
survey
the
paris
climate
agreement
pledged
countries
to
shift
the
world
economy
away
from
fossil
fuels
and
limit
the
rise
in
global
temperatures
to
avert
more
extreme
weather
rising
sea
levels
and
the
loss
of
plant
and
animal
species
the
united
states
has
since
said
it
will
withdraw
from
the
deal
global
leaders
will
meet
in
poland
from
to
to
produce
a
rule
book
on
how
to
reach
these
targets
and
implement
the
paris
deal
agreed
by
nearly
nations
australia
one
of
the
largest
carbon
emitters
per
capita
has
vowed
to
lower
emissions
by
percent
from
levels
by
a
figure
that
new
prime
minister
scott
morrison
said
his
administration
would
not
revise
rebuking
the
school
walkouts
morrison
said
in
parliament
on
monday
that
there
should
be
more
learning
in
schools
and
less
activism
on
climate
change
global
temperatures
are
on
course
for
a
rise
of
degrees
to
degrees
celsius
degrees
to
degrees
fahrenheit
this
century
far
overshooting
a
global
target
of
limiting
the
increase
to
or
less
the
world
meteorological
organization
said
thursday
scientists
say
meeting
a
target
would
keep
the
global
sea
level
rise
metre
inches
lower
by
than
a
target
which
could
give
people
living
on
the
world
s
coasts
and
islands
time
to
adapt
to
climate
change
the
climate
projections
have
prompted
some
young
people
to
sue
their
governments
not
taking
action
on
something
that
you
recognise
is
dangerous
is
a
violation
of
our
rights
because
we
have
the
right
to
live
said
student
bernadette
part
of
a
group
that
is
suing
the
canadian
government
official
data
regularly
shows
that
canada
has
little
chance
of
meeting
its
climate
change
goals
of
reducing
emissions
by
percent
from
levels
by
environnement
jeunesse
the
organisation
that
launched
the
class
action
on
behalf
of
in
quebec
province
on
monday
said
the
canadian
government
must
do
more
i
really
feel
like
this
is
an
emergency
for
all
of
us
words
are
really
not
enough
when
it
comes
to
climate
change
said
catherine
gauthier
head
of
the
youth
climate
advocacy
group
across
the
border
in
the
united
states
the
second
largest
contributor
of
carbon
emissions
after
china
children
and
young
adults
are
also
taking
the
government
to
court
the
group
aged
between
and
when
the
lawsuit
was
filed
in
accused
federal
officials
and
oil
industry
executives
of
violating
their
due
process
rights
by
knowing
for
decades
that
carbon
pollution
poisons
the
environment
but
doing
nothing
about
it
these
are
people
who
are
put
in
office
to
work
for
the
general
public
but
they
keep
taking
actions
that
are
directly
linked
to
worsening
climate
change
said
oregonian
avery
mcrae
who
is
one
of
the
plaintiffs
president
donald
trump
who
vowed
to
withdraw
from
the
paris
deal
has
argued
the
accord
would
hurt
his
nation
s
economy
and
provide
little
tangible
environmental
benefit
trump
and
some
cabinet
members
have
repeatedly
cast
doubt
on
climate
change
science
despite
a
recent
government
report
projecting
that
climate
change
will
cost
the
economy
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
by
the
end
of
the
century
i
am
worried
about
my
future
the
future
is
what
i
m
fighting
for
this
is
a
global
movement
and
we
need
everyone
on
board
