workmen
erected
metal
barriers
and
plywood
boards
on
the
facades
of
restaurants
and
boutiques
lining
the
champs
elysees
on
friday
ahead
of
a
second
demonstration
in
the
french
capital
by
protesters
angry
at
high
fuel
prices
for
more
than
two
weeks
the
yellow
vests
have
blocked
roads
across
france
in
a
spontaneous
popular
rebellion
against
diesel
tax
hikes
and
the
high
cost
of
living
it
has
grown
into
one
of
the
largest
and
most
stubborn
challenges
emmanuel
macron
has
faced
in
his
presidency
a
week
ago
thousands
of
protesters
who
have
no
leader
and
have
largely
organised
themselves
online
converged
on
paris
for
the
first
time
turning
the
champs
elysees
into
a
battlezone
as
they
clashed
with
police
firing
tear
gas
and
water
canon
for
now
the
yellow
vests
who
take
their
name
from
the
jackets
all
motorists
in
france
must
carry
in
their
vehicles
enjoy
widespread
public
support
i
completely
agree
with
the
protesters
said
one
shopper
on
the
champs
elysees
who
identified
herself
only
as
brigitte
it
s
regrettable
to
see
measures
being
taken
against
possible
damage
but
i
support
the
when
they
began
the
protests
caught
macron
just
as
he
was
trying
to
counter
a
plunge
in
popularity
with
his
approval
at
barely
percent
his
unyielding
response
has
exposed
him
to
charges
of
being
out
of
touch
with
common
folk
the
outburst
of
anger
is
strongest
in
rural
villages
provincial
towns
and
sprawling
city
outskirts
and
mirrors
the
disconnect
between
urban
elites
and
alienated
voters
that
has
spurred
the
rise
of
populist
forces
across
europe
in
the
united
states
and
in
britain
s
brexit
vote
meeting
french
expatriates
in
buenos
aires
ahead
of
a
summit
macron
said
he
understood
the
legitimate
anger
impatience
and
suffering
of
people
who
wanted
to
live
better
but
said
there
would
be
no
in
policy
direction
it
will
fall
on
me
to
take
additional
steps
in
the
weeks
and
months
to
come
but
they
will
never
be
a
step
backwards
said
the
former
investment
banker
the
yellow
vests
have
also
inspired
protests
next
door
in
belgium
where
on
friday
demonstrators
hurled
rocks
at
the
prime
minister
s
office
france
s
interior
minister
christophe
castaner
said
the
champs
elysees
would
be
closed
to
traffic
and
pedestrians
would
be
funnelled
through
checkpoints
several
thousand
police
officers
will
be
deployed
along
the
avenue
