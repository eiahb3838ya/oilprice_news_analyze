allowing
transfers
in
norwegian
waters
from
yamal
in
arctic
russia
one
of
the
world
s
largest
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
terminals
undercuts
europe
s
energy
diversification
efforts
the
state
department
said
on
friday
by
transferring
lng
to
more
conventional
tankers
in
norway
the
arctic
vessels
cut
in
half
the
distance
they
would
cover
to
deliver
gas
to
europe
enabling
more
frequent
shipments
from
the
novatek
terminal
and
increasing
russia
s
gas
exports
last
week
the
first
such
transfer
took
place
off
the
norwegian
arctic
port
of
honningsvag
asked
what
was
the
position
on
the
activity
in
norwegian
waters
the
state
department
told
reuters
at
a
time
when
russian
gas
comprises
a
growing
proportion
of
europe
s
energy
imports
additional
volumes
of
russian
gas
will
undercut
europe
s
energy
diversification
efforts
we
are
working
closely
with
our
european
partners
to
increase
their
energy
security
by
promoting
diversification
of
energy
fuel
types
energy
routes
and
energy
source
russia
condemned
the
position
such
statements
are
a
definitive
example
of
resorting
to
political
instruments
for
the
sake
of
unfair
competition
and
direct
infringement
of
trade
freedom
principles
the
russian
embassy
in
oslo
said
in
a
statement
the
united
states
has
been
pressing
europe
to
cut
its
reliance
on
cheap
russian
gas
and
buy
much
more
expensive
lng
instead
which
many
european
countries
including
industrial
heavyweight
germany
have
so
far
resisted
it
has
called
on
european
countries
to
reject
russian
gas
pipelines
which
washington
says
are
being
used
to
cement
moscow
s
grip
on
central
and
eastern
in
particular
the
united
states
has
said
it
could
impose
new
sanctions
on
russia
to
try
to
block
the
construction
of
the
nord
stream
pipeline
across
the
baltic
sea
to
the
european
union
norway
europe
s
supplier
of
gas
after
russia
said
it
was
not
concerned
by
the
transfers
europe
has
a
gas
market
the
planned
transfers
of
russian
lng
in
northern
norway
are
a
commercial
project
the
norwegian
ministry
for
oil
and
energy
told
reuters
the
fact
that
lng
is
brought
to
the
market
via
such
transfers
is
not
a
concern
for
the
thanks
to
the
transfers
off
norway
yamal
is
expected
to
export
as
much
as
million
tonnes
of
lng
in
the
next
seven
months
according
to
the
port
hosting
its
operations
and
reuters
calculations
the
in
output
puts
the
novatek
terminal
in
operation
for
less
than
a
year
in
excess
of
its
nameplate
capacity
with
the
norwegian
transfers
the
only
way
it
can
deliver
the
additional
lng
to
the
market
yamal
uses
lng
tankers
to
carry
the
gas
through
the
barents
sea
these
vessels
then
transfer
the
cargo
to
more
conventional
tankers
in
europe
enabling
them
to
return
sooner
to
the
facility
and
pick
up
more
supplies
