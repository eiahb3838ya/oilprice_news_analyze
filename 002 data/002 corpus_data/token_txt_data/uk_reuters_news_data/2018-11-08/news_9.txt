been
colder

and
the

rushed
to
deliver

earlier
this

while

utilities
are
firing
up
emergency
plans
in
case
demand
skyrockets
and
as
more
people
look
to
switch
to
the
cheaper
fuel
heating
oil
costs
particularly
in
the
northeast
are
expected
to
hit
highs
this
winter
that
s
driving
consumers
to
request
switching
to
cheaper
natural
gas
but
that
s
worrying
utilities
who
say
there
will
not
be
enough
pipelines
to
handle
demand
in
subsequent
cold
seasons
households
burning

oil
can
expect
to
pay
an
average
of
this
winter
or
more
than
last
year
up
percent
according
to
the
energy
department
that
will
hit
households
in
the
northeast
hardest
since
over
percent
of
the
homes
burning
oil
for
heat
are
located
there

this

a

it
s
been
a
pretty
good
shot
to
the

about
barrels
a

in
recent
weeks
compared
with
just
barrels

said

consumers
are

homes
using
natural

in
the
northeast
are
expected
to
pay
just
this
winter
down
percent
from
last
year
even
as
homes
in
the
region
are
projected
to
burn
percent
more
fuel
this
year
than
last
with
temperatures
forecast
to
be
about
percent
colder
than
last
year
that
price
tag
is
still
higher
than
the
national
forecasted
average
of
this
winter
and
it
is
driving
more
requests
for
customers
to
switch
to
natural
gas
companies
have
warned
that
capacity
of
the
pipes
supplying
gas
to
new
york
city
and
new
england
has
not
kept
up
with
growing
demand
we
continue
to
see
an
increase
in
demand
from
oil
to
gas
conversions
and
new
construction
and
anticipate
the
need
for
additional
capacity
to
meet
demand
in
time
for
the
winter

karen

a
spokeswoman
for

grid
plc
which

programs
and
a

response
plan
to
incentivize
consumers
to
reduce
gas
use
on

days
the
company
told
new
york
state
regulators
in
a
recent
filing
that
it
may
need
to
impose
a
temporary
moratorium
on
new
gas
customers
due
to
limited
space
on
existing
pipelines
con
edison
s
incentive
programs
will
help
maintain
service
but
they
do
not
eliminate
the
need
for
a
new
