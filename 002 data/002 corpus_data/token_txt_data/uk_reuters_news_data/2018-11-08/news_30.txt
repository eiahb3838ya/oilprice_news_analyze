update 2-dyson wins fight against eu energy labelling rules
brussels
reuters
british
company
dyson
which
makes
bagless
vacuum
cleaners
has
succeeded
in
overturning
a
european
union
law
on
energy
efficiency
labelling
after
a
battle
with
europe
s
second
highest
court
backing
its
argument
that
the
legislation
discriminated
against
its
products
the
general
court
on
thursday
reversed
a
ruling
which
rejected
dyson
s
challenge
to
the
law
and
scrapped
the
labelling
regulation
the
requirements
were
introduced
by
the
european
commission
in
september
to
inform
consumers
of
energy
efficiency
levels
and
cleaning
performance
of
vacuum
cleaners
among
other
items
the
goal
was
to
prevent
energy
waste
reduce
fuel
bills
and
cut
carbon
emissions
dyson
in
challenged
the
proposed
rules
which
apply
in
all
of
the
eu
countries
saying
the
labelling
requirements
on
vacuum
cleaners
discriminated
against
its
particular
technology
and
misled
customers
about
the
efficiency
of
some
vacuum
cleaners
particularly
those
with
bags
it
said
the
rules
unfairly
benefited
its
german
rivals
the
general
court
agreed
with
the
company
s
arguments
and
scrapped
the
regulation
saying
that
the
eu
executive
s
testing
method
failed
to
comply
with
key
elements
of
the
directive
the
move
came
after
the
eu
court
of
justice
ecj
last
year
ordered
the
lower
tribunal
to
the
case
following
an
appeal
by
dyson
tests
of
a
vacuum
cleaner
s
energy
efficiency
carried
out
with
an
empty
receptacle
do
not
reflect
conditions
as
close
as
possible
to
actual
conditions
of
use
judges
said
the
ruling
means
that
companies
will
not
be
required
to
display
energy
efficiency
labels
on
their
products
but
will
still
have
to
comply
with
rules
designed
to
cut
energy
and
resource
consumption
the
commission
which
can
appeal
the
case
at
the
ecj
but
only
on
points
of
law
said
it
would
study
the
ruling
before
deciding
on
the
next
step
this
judgement
does
not
put
into
question
the
effectiveness
of
eu
energy
efficiency
policy
in
general
or
the
important
contribution
it
makes
on
meeting
european
union
efficiency
targets
commission
spokeswoman
itkonen
told
reporters
dyson
welcomed
the
judgement
we
have
been
arguing
consistently
that
the
commission
committed
two
legal
violations
to
the
detriment
of
european
consumers
and
dyson
the
company
said
in
a
statement
european
parliament
lawmaker
ashley
fox
urged
the
eu
executive
to
refine
its
testing
process
the
commission
must
now
urgently
design
new
tests
that
properly
inform
shoppers
promote
a
reduction
in
energy
use
and
are
fair
to
innovative
entrepreneurs
like
mr
dyson
