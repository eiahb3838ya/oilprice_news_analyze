oil

supported
by
rumblings
from
within
opec
that
production
curbs
may
become
necessary
again
to
prevent
a
return
of
global
oversupply

a

opec
as

decided
last

from

to
reduce

of

at

the
introduction
of
sanctions
earlier
this
week
against
iran
failed
to
lift
the
market
given
the
announcement
that
eight
countries
including
three
of
the
world
s
biggest
importers
would
receive
waivers
to
carry
on
buying
iranian
crude
for
up
to
six
months
hansen
said
preventing
oil
prices
from
rising
any
further
has
been
a
relentless
rise
in
crude
output
which
hit
a
record
million
bpd
in
the
week
ending
according
to
energy
information
administration
eia
data
released
on
wednesday
that
s
a
threefold
increase
from
the
low
reached
a

ago
and
a

just
this

it
makes
the
united

the

biggest
producer
of

oil
that
has
impacted
crude

which
rose
by

barrels
in
the
week
ending
to
million

the
eia
said
crude
stocks
moved
back
above
their
average
levels
in

production
has
not
just
risen
in
the
united
states
but
also
in
many
other
countries
including
russia
saudi

and
brazil
stoking

of
