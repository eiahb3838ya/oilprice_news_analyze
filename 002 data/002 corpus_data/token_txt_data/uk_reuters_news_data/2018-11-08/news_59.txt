led

breathed
a

the
midterm

in

wrested

retained

we

analysts
said
in
a
report
while
a
divided
congress
will
make
it
harder
for
president
donald
trump
to
push
through
new
legislation
such
as
additional
tax
cuts
investors
do
not
expect
a
reversal
of
recently
enacted
tax
cuts
and
deregulation
the
key
point
after
the
midterm
elections
is
that
stocks
showed
they
had
developed
immunity
towards
higher
yields
the
last
time
treasury
yields
were
at
this
level
a
month

they
had

a
major
fall

steady
fundamentals
will
support
this
trend

to
pulling
back

plumbed
on
wednesday
its
lowest
since
that
low

the
greenback
was
driven
by
a
reaction
to
the
midterm
election
results
with
a
divided
congress
seen
dulling
trump
s
fiscal
stimulus
drive
some
focus
was
also
on
the
federal
reserve
s
monetary
policy
due
later
on
thursday
the
fed
however
is
not
expected
to
hike
interest
rates
until
its
next
gathering
in
december
and
analysts
expected
this
meeting
to
have
limited
market
impact
the
central
bank
has
tightened
monetary
policy
three
times

the
latest

hike
coming
in

a
split
congress
is
unlikely
to
materially
alter
the

s
hiking
trajectory

the

will

raising
