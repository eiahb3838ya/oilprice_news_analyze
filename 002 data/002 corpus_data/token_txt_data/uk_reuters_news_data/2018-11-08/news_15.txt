the
decision
to
review
its
tariffs
on
argentine
biodiesel
could
mean
a
reversal
of
fortune
for
exporters
whose
shipments
from
the
south
american
country
have
been
practically
nil
the
biodiesel
chamber
of
argentina
said
on
thursday
the
department
of
commerce
announced
on
wednesday
there
was
just
cause
to
review
the
taxes
it
applied
at
the
end
of
to
argentine
biodiesel
which
cut
off
access
to
the
main
market
for
argentina
s
product
at
the
time
wednesday
s
announcement
prompted
enthusiasm
from
argentine
biofuel
exporters
whose
shipments
have
slowed
to
a
trickle
since
september
as
the
european
union
eu
the
new
main
destination
for
argentine
biofuel
also
considers
adding
tariffs
this
is
a
necessary
and
important
first
step
victor
castro
executive
director
of
the
argentine
chamber
of
biofuels
carbio
whose
members
include
biodiesel
exporters
cargill
inc
and
bunge
ltd
told
reuters
we
are
convinced
that
tariffs
are
a
totally
unfair
measure
and
it
is
very
important
to
be
able
to
export
to
that
market
he
said
adding
that
due
to
limited
international
commercial
activity
the
production
level
in
argentine
biodiesel
plants
has
been
very
low
argentina
is
one
of
the
world
s
top
producers
of
biodiesel
fuel
exporting
million
tons
worth
billion
in
this
year
biodiesel
producers
in
argentina
exported
almost
million
tons
of
the
fuel
between
january
and
august
of
which
percent
went
to
the
eu
according
to
official
data
from
argentina
state
statistics
agency
indec
however
in
september
and
october
the
volume
of
biodiesel
shipped
abroad
was
zero
the
halt
in
exports
coincided
with
the
eu
s
expected
decision
on
whether
to
sanction
argentina
s
biodiesel
industry
over
suspicions
of
receiving
subsidies
the
eu
postponed
its
ruling
in
late
september
saying
it
would
continue
its
investigation
the
announcement
by
the
united
states
that
it
will
review
the
tariffs
comes
a
few
months
after
argentina
increased
duties
on
biodiesel
exports
and
cut
tariffs
on
grains
and
soybean
oil
shipments
a
key
ingredient
for
biodiesel
production

argentina
