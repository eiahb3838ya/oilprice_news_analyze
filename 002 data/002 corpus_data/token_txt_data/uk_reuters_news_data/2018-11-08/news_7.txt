global
crude
supply
which
is
increasing
more
quickly
than
many
had
expected
the
market
focused
on
record
crude
production
and
signals
from
iraq
abu
dhabi
and
indonesia
that
output
will
grow
more
quickly
than
expected
in
fears
of
the
potential
supply
glut
dampened
a
rally
early
in
the
session
driven
by
chinese
data
that
showed
record
oil
imports
there
s
a
trifecta
of
trouble
created
by
stockpile

opec
overproduction
and
the
watering
down
of
iran
sanctions

earlier
customs
data
showed
china
will
still
be
allowed
to
import
some
iranian
crude
under
a
waiver
to

that
will
enable
it
to
purchase

two

familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
on
tuesday
crude
output
reached
a
new
record
high
of
million
bpd
in
the
latest
week
and
the
country
has
now
overtaken
russia
as
the
world
s
largest
oil
producer
the
move
higher
in
production
was
a
large
jump
not
just
a
tick
yawger
said
the
energy
information
administration
said
this
week
it
expects
output
to
top
million
bpd
by
the
middle

thanks
to

even
with
sanctions
on
iranian
oil
in
place
investors
believe
there
is
more
than
enough
supply
to
meet
demand
waivers
granted
to
the
sanctions
intensify
the
market
s
perception
that
sanctions
may
not
limit
crude
supply
as
much
as
initially
expected
this
view
is
reflected
in
price
charts
showing
the
january
brent
futures
contract
trading
at
a
discount
to
february
this
price
structure
known
as
contango
materializes
when
market
players
believe
there
is
a
supply
glut
and
decide
to
store
oil
rather
than
sell
it
this
creates
an
even
larger
pool
of
unsold
crude
some
market
watchers
believe
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
allies
including
russia
may
take
steps
to
reduce
supply
opec
and
russia
may
use
