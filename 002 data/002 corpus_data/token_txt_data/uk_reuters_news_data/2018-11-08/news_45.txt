world
stocks
basked
in
an
eighth
straight
session
of
gains
in
their
longest
winning
streak
of
the
year
on
thursday
as
reassuring
trade
data
from
china
kept
the
previous
day
s
midterms
risk
rally
rolling
traders
were
gearing
up
for
the
latest
federal
reserve
meeting
in
a
confident
mood
and
the
contrast
to
a
month
ago
when
markets
were
taking
a
painful
pounding
could
not
have
been
more
stark
european
shares
jumped
to
a
high
after
results
from
socgen
and
commerzbank
and
france
s
sodexho
soothed
concerns
about
slowing
corporate
earnings
asia
and
wall
street
had
set
similar
milestones
overnight
the
dollar
and
bond
yields
also
rose
the
currency
pulling
away
from
week
lows
hit
after
donald
trump
s
loss
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
midterms
reduced
the
chance
of
another
blizzard
of
tax
cuts
that
in
turn
had
analysts
and
money
managers
breathing
a
sigh
of
relief
that
the
economy
wouldn
t
ultimately
overheat
and
force
the
fed
to
keep
jacking
up
borrowing
costs
we
think
we
are
close
to
the
end
of
the
appreciation
of
the
dollar
said
fund
manager
amundi
s
didier
borowski
who
expects
the
fed
to
pause
its
hiking
cycle
next
year
as
the
economy
starts
to
slow
usually
we
see
a
rally
in
stocks
he
added
that
rally
may
in
fact
be
arriving
early
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
had
advanced
percent
and
the
shanghai
composite
index
climbed
percent
overnight
receiving
a
mild
lift
from
october
chinese
exports
data
australian
stocks
rose
percent
too
south
korea
s
kospi
added
percent
and
japan
s
nikkei
surged
percent
which
was
almost
as
much
as
wall
street
s
percent
leap
going
forward
we
think
the
removal
of
uncertainty
and
realization
of
the
expected
outcome
should
be
supportive
for
risk
assets
goldman
sachs
analysts
said
in
a
report
over
in
the
bond
market
there
was
plenty
of
activity
too
the
treasury
note
yield
rose
to
percent
its
highest
since
and
those
on
europe
s
equivalent
german
bund
benchmark
climbed
to
a
high
italian
government
bond
yields
were
up
to
five
basis
points
higher
in
early
trade
too
ahead
of
key
economic
projections
from
the
european
commission
which
are
expected
to
warn
the
country
s
deficit
will
be
much
higher
than
suggested
by
rome
it
pushed
italy
s
bond
spread
over
germany
out
to
basis
points
and
mizuho
rates
strategist
peter
chatwell
warned
of
a
possible
further
if
rome
s
populist
coalition
government
thumbs
its
nose
at
brussels
again
in
our
model
it
doesn
t
move
fair
value
much
from
bps
over
germany
but
scary
headlines
are
likely
to
cause
a
widening
he
added
the
euro
hovered
at
just
above
having
swung
back
from
but
the
focus
was
turning
to
the
federal
reserve
later
it
won
t
hold
a
news
conference
this
month
but
will
as
always
publish
a
statement
that
is
expect
to
lay
the
ground
for
a
fourth
rate
hike
of
the
year
next
month
a
split
congress
is
unlikely
to
materially
alter
the
fed
s
hiking
trajectory
and
the
fed
will
be
biased
to
keep
raising
rates
until
the
data
or
financial
conditions
turn
