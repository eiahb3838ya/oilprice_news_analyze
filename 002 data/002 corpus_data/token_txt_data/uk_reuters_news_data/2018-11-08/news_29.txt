sonatrach
ceo
abdelmoumen

and
his
colleagues
have
been
courting
sunni

masters
from
communities
in
areas
near
prospective
southern

fields
to
win
over
locals
worried
about

to

in

where
most
of

lie

also
home
to
more
traditional
communities

sonatrach
has
to

cares
about

we
appreciate

sonatrach
has
been
increasingly
turning
to
foreign
firms
which
have
long
been
reluctant
to
invest
in
algeria
because
of
red
tape
and
tough
terms
to
push
up
oil
and
gas
output
but
it
needs
to
ensure
that
international
companies
which
sign
up
do
not
face
protests
from
local
communities
like
the
demonstrations
that
forced
sonatrach
temporarily
to
halt
shale
exploration

leaders
can
influence
these
often
remote
communities
from
their
zawiyas
which
are
houses
where
people
gather
to
listen
to
sermons
recite
the
koran
and
conduct
rhythmic
rituals
that
aim
to
bring
practitioners
of
sufism
closer
to
god
we
will
tell
the
people
and
the
youth
that
sonatrach
s
efforts
are
to
be
welcome

sonatrach
employees
ibrahim
ended
the
meeting
by
leading
prayers
you
need
to
respect
people
you
need
to
talk
to
people
and
the
best
way
is
to
go
through
their
spiritual
leaders
said
osmani
a
local
at
the
gathering
who
only
gave
his
first
name
villagers
in
the
south
of
algeria
often
grumble
that
too
much
of
the
nation
s
energy
wealth
heads
to
the
north
and
the
capital
algiers
so
sonatrach
has
promised
to
build
new
public
facilities
such
as
a
cultural
centre
hospital
and
stadium
sonatrach
executives
also
point
to
the
thousands
of
jobs
it
had
provided
in
the
energy
industry
and
related
work
to
youths
in
the
south
during
the
past
months
more
opportunities
may
be
on
the
way
in
