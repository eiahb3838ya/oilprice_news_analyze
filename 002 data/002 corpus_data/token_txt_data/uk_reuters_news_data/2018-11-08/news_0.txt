coke's coffers crammed with kina as dollar crunch hits papua new guinea
reuters
has
mastered
the
business
of
getting
its
sweet
fizzy
drinks
into
even
the
most
isolated
of
papua
new
guinea
s
tropical
islands
and
mountain
villages
but
getting
the
proceeds
out
of
the
south
pacific
nation
is
proving
much
more
troublesome
undermining
efforts
by
the
host
of
this
month
s
apec
meeting
to
portray
itself
as
an
attractive
destination
for
international
investment
amatil
which
distributes
coke
in
the
region
recently
disclosed
it
was
holding
more
of
png
kina
currency
than
it
wanted
due
to
foreign
exchange
restraints
a
complaint
echoed
by
other
big
businesses
the
restrictions
used
to
prop
up
the
kina
by
fixing
its
value
in
a
narrow
band
have
created
a
shortage
of
dollars
and
a
queue
to
buy
them
that
is
stifling
business
investment
and
with
it
the
country
s
economic
prospects
business
leaders
say
for
most
customers
it
has
provided
an
impediment
to
the
growth
of
their
business

of

with
their

earlier
this

that
after

everyone
will
remember
where
papua
new
guinea
is
and
not
confuse
it
with
an
african
country
papua

has
one
of
the
largest
economies
in
the
pacific

region
backed
by
mining
timber
fishing
and
huge
energy
reserves
riding
booming
commodity
prices
the
kina
touched
as
high
as
in
but
fell
as
low
as
the
following
year
when
the
oil
price
plunged
demand
for
kina
also
dropped
away
sharply
since
the
end
of
construction
in
of
a
giant
lng
project
led
by
exxon

the

shortfall
was
exacerbated
by

driving
a

in
august
according
to
papua

s
central

s
most
recent
policy
update
that
has
left
businesses
even
those
earmarked
for
priority
access
to
foreign
currency
such
as

aviation
and
medicine
pleading
with
suppliers
to
accept
late
payments
it
does
make
it
a
challenge
to
get

as

managing

told
reuters
the

even
briefly
considered
buying
coffee
and
trying
to
sell
that
offshore
to
bring
in
some
dollars
he
added
economists
say
the
solution
is
to
let
the
kina
gradually
fall
to
encourage
dollars
to
flow
but
the

is
staking
its
hopes
on
an
anticipated

expected
as
part
of
an
expansion
of

recovering
