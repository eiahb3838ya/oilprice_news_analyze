shares
in
australia
s
biggest

pipeline
company
apa
group
fell
percent
on
thursday
after
australia
s
treasurer
said
he
intended
to
block
a
a
billion
billion
buyout
by
hong
kong
s
ck
group
treasurer
josh
frydenberg
said
after
market
hours
on
wednesday
that
his
preliminary
view
was
that
the
takeover
was
against
the
national
interest
because
it
would
create
a
concentration
of
foreign
ownership
in
the
sector
frydenbeg
said
the
move
was
not
a
reflection
on

analysts
said
the
move
appeared
to
be
partly
aimed
at
preventing
chinese
ownership
of
a
strategic
asset
i
don
t
think
its
just
the
china
element
but
a
combination
of
important
assets
concentration
of
ownership
and
china
said
morningstar
analyst
adrian
atkins
i
think
the
chinese
element
maybe
had
a
bit
more
of
an
impact
than
the
treasurer
s
letting
on
it
d
probably
be
unpopular
with
the
electorate
to
have
a
major
asset
go
to
a
chinese
firm
he
said
the
rebuff
is
likely
to
test
an
already
strained
relationship
between
australia
and
its
largest
trading
partner
just

s
foreign

makes
a
