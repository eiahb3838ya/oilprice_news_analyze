volkswagen
and
an
independent
monitoring
team
still
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
before
the

can
be
certified
after
a
billion
global
emissions
cheating
scandal
larry

an
independent
compliance
auditor
said
on
thursday
thompson
a
former
deputy
attorney
general
was
installed
in
as
compliance
auditor
as
part
of
vw
s
criminal
plea
agreement
with
the
justice
department
thompson
had
been
due
to
appear
at
a
conference
hosted
by
german
magazine
automobilwoche
but
instead
spoke
to
participants
in
a
video
recording
due
to
a
scheduling
conflict
he
said
vw
was
making
good
progress
on
improving
its
processes
and
cited
what
he
called
very
good
cooperation
and
support
by
vw
s
project
management
office
as
well
as
top
company
executives
and
the
works
councils
of
both
vw
and
audi
vw
and
other
german
carmakers
agreed
on
thursday
to
spend
up
to
euros
per
vehicle
including
through
incentives
to
help
reduce
diesel
emissions
given
a
growing
number
of
driving
bans
in
major
cities
top
german
politicians
say
the
emissions
cheating
scandal
damaged
the
global
reputation
of
the
german
car
industry
and
say
consumers
should
not
bear
the
cost
of
retrofitting
cars
thompson
said
his
team
had
reviewed
thousands
of
pages
of
documents
and
spoken
with
hundreds
of
employees
and
officers
now
he
said
vw
and
the
monitoring
team
would
begin
testing
to
ensure
revamped
compliance
procedures
actually
worked
this
effort
is
critical
ultimately
i
must
certify
that
the
company
s
compliance
program
is
effective
that
it
is
designed
to
prevent
and
detect
violations
of
the
and
environmental
laws
he
said
both
the
company
and
the
monitor
team
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
before
in
august
when
thompson
released
a
first
public
report
on
the
turnaround
effort
he
said
he
disagreed
with
some
vw
executives
use
of
privacy
and
attorney
client
privilege
rights
to
withhold
information
hiltrud
werner
vw
s
chief
of
integrity
and
legal
affairs
said
the
company
was
working
hard
to
transform
its
culture
through
a
wide
range
of
measures
including
asking
managers
to
take
be
more
about
compliance
issues
this
is
a
hot
phase
for
us
and
that
means
we
must
bundle
all
energies
in
the
company
she
told
the
conference
adding
that
certification
was
due
to
be
completed
by
it
is
my
personal
conviction
that
we
don
t
need
more
compliance
experts
we
need
compliant
managers
she
said
adding
the
goal
was
to
ensure
that
top
managers
were
forced
to
permanently
grapple
with
this
issue
and
that
it
remains
in
the
consciousness
