the

on

led
by

sectors
as
the
market
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
after
the
midterm
elections
in
which
democrats
wrested
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
republicans
retained
the
senate
going
forward
we
think
the
removal
of
uncertainty
and
realization
of
the
expected
outcome
should
be
supportive

sachs
analysts
said
in
a
report
while
a
divided
congress
will
make
it
harder
for
president
donald
trump
to
push
through
new
legislation
such
as
additional
tax
cuts
investors
do
not
expect
a
reversal
of
recently
enacted
tax
cuts
and
deregulation
the
key
point
after
the
midterm
elections
is
that
stocks
showed
they
had
developed
immunity
towards
higher
yields
the
last
time
treasury
yields
were
at
this
level
a
month
ago
they
had
helped
trigger
a
major
fall

stocks
said
junichi
ishikawa
senior
fx
strategist
at
ig
securities
in
tokyo
steady
fundamentals
will
support
this
trend
of
equities
and
yields
rising
in
tandem
which
should
also
prop
up
the

reducing

the
dollar
index
against
a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
gained
percent
to
pulling
back
from
plumbed
on
wednesday
its
lowest
since
that
low
for
the
greenback
was
driven
by
a
reaction
to
the
midterm
election
results
with
a
divided
congress
seen
dulling
trump
s
fiscal
stimulus
drive
some
focus
was
also
on
the
federal
reserve
s
monetary
policy
due
later
on
thursday
the
fed
however
is
not
expected
to
hike
interest
rates
until
its
next
gathering
in
december
and
analysts
expected
this
meeting
to
have
limited
market
impact
the
central
bank
has
tightened
monetary
policy
three
times
in
with
the
latest
rate
hike
coming
in
september
a
split
congress
is
unlikely
to
materially
alter
the
fed
s
hiking
trajectory
and
the
fed
will
be
biased
to
keep
raising
rates
