update 2-toshiba to pay enn more than $800 million to exit u.s. lng business
reuters
japan
s
toshiba
corp
will
exit
its
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
business
by
paying
china
s
enn
ecological
holdings
co
more
than
million
to
take
over
the
unit
as
part
of
a
plan
to
shed
assets
the
sale
is
the
disappointing
culmination
of
a
venture
that
puzzled
analysts
when
it
was
announced
in
asian
lng
prices
have
plunged
percent
in
the
past
five
years
and
the
potential
for
future
losses
spurred
toshiba
s
exit
under
the
deal
toshiba
will
sell
its
toshiba
america
lng
corp
unit
to
enn
ecological
a
unit
of
enn
group
for
million
the
japanese
company
said
in
a
statement
on
thursday
however
once
that
sale
is
complete
toshiba
will
then
make
a
payment
of
million
to
enn
to
pass
on
its
roughly
billion
commitment
starting
in
to
purchase
million
tonnes
per
year
of
lng
over
years
from
freeport
lng
in
texas
the
project
posed
a
huge
risk
because
no
one
knows
how
the
situation
will
be
over
the
next
years
toshiba
s
chief
executive
officer
nobuaki
kurumatani
told
reporters
at
a
press
conference
the
company
booked
a
charge
of
billion
yen
million
for
exiting
the
lng
business
in
its
earnings
it
announced
on
thursday
the
deal
is
our
second
major
step
to
expand
in
the
overseas
upstream
business
we
expect
to
get
million
tonnes
of
relatively
lng
starting
in
to
meet
growing
domestic
demand
said
clarissa
zhang
public
relations
director
of
enn
ecological
toshiba
has
spent
years
trying
to
either
sell
the
gas
to
power
customers
or
offload
the
business
toshiba
s
annual
cost
of
its
deal
with
freeport
was
a
bit
over
million
dollars
meaning
the
company
is
paying
about
two
years
of
those
costs
to
enn
to
take
the
obligations
said
nicholas
browne
director
of
gas
and
lng
at
wood
mackenzie
for
enn
this
represents
a
relatively
low
cost
and
immediate
way
to
source
significant
volumes
browne
said
for
toshiba
it
clearly
ends
their
short
foray
in
the
lng
business
enn
has
been
very
open
that
it
plans
to
set
up
an
lng
trading
business
as
such
these
volumes
will
contribute
to
their
portfolio
and
some
will
not
end
up
in
still
the
deal
is
a
positive
sign
for
lng
developers
that
china
is
still
open
for
business
amid
a
trade
war
between
the
world
s
economies
toshiba
stunned
the
market
in
when
it
decided
to
enter
the
lng
business
with
no
experience
in
shipping
or
the
logistics
of
the
gas
and
lng
business
it
seemed
an
odd
fit
analysts
said
at
the
time
toshiba
s
plan
was
to
pitch
lng
supplies
as
a
sweetener
to
likely
asian
buyers
of
its
turbines
used
in
combined
cycle
power
plants
the
company
probably
wanted
to
add
value
to
its
power
plant
business
by
selling
not
only
the
power
plants
but
also
fuel
but
for
plant
builders
it
s
always
better
to
do
it
all
via
tenders
