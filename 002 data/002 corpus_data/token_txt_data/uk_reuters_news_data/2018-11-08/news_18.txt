speaking
in

encourage
the

ever
get
to
the

where
we
can
support
nord
stream
he
added
that
sanctions
were
an
option

that

supports
a
and
energy
security
policy
perry
said
of
the
deal
with
warsaw
energy
security
in
turn
requires
energy
diversity
that
is
the
reason
we
oppose
the
nord
stream
project

would
further
increase
the
dangerous
energy
dependence
many
european

have
on
