said
following
the

adding
that

so
but
all
three
big
german
carmakers
including
vw
were
committed
to
spending
up
to
euros
for
various
measures
including
incentives
scheuer
said
they
were
all
keen
to
press
ahead
with
such
incentives
which
aim
to
convince
customers
to
buy
newer
cleaner
vehicles
that
have
lower
emissions

government
has
been
pushing
carmakers
to
shoulder
more

retrofitting
cars
though
germany

auto
giants
have
been
reluctant
to
take
on
more
costs
than
necessary
volkswagen
daimler
and
bmw
will
make
sure
their
customers
can
remain
mobile
scheuer
told
reporters
urging
foreign
rivals
like
fiat
and

to
match
the

said
the
german
firms
had
made
scandals
involving
schemes
to
conceal
the
true
levels
of
pollutant
emissions
from
diesel
cars
has
dealt
repeated
blows
to
the

years
as
the

leaders
were
meeting
scheuer
a

in
cologne
ordered
driving
bans
in
some
parts
of
the

underlining
the
stakes
for
politicians
concerned
that
a
lack
of
progress
could
trigger
deeply
unpopular
driving
bans

group
duh
had
filed
complaints
against
the
western
state
of
north
home
to
cologne
and
bonn
saying
the

needed
to
ensure
their
nitrogen
dioxide
levels
stuck
to
permitted
limits
and
calling
for
a
ban
of
diesel
vehicles
in
those
cities
it
will
cause
disruption
for
the
transport
infrastructure
of
the
city
of
cologne
and

a
significant
impact
on
residents
