up
and
running

have
slipped

muloni
said
at
the
africa
oil
week
conference
in
cape
town
that
date
is
in
line
with
industry
targets
in
april
uganda
signed
a
deal
with
a
consortium
including
a
subsidiary
of
general
electric
to
build
and
operate
a
barrel
per
day
refinery
that
will
cost
billion
muloni
said
the
refinery
should
be
operational
by
uganda
discovered
crude
reserves
more
than
years
ago
but
the
start
of
production
has
been
repeatedly
delayed
by
disagreements
with
field
operators
over
taxes
and
development
strategy
uganda
initially
said
it
would
not
produce
oil
until
the
refinery
was
complete
but
its
timetable
is
now
being
driven
by
a
planned
export
pipeline
that
will
snake
across
neighbouring
tanzania
muloni
said
she
expected
that
to
come
on
line
quickly
we
are
waiting
for
the
companies
to
make
their
final
investment
decisions
the
engineering
designs
have
been
completed
and
we
are
just
going
through
the
processes
of
approval
by

she
said
she
hoped
it
would
be
done
before
the
end
of
but
next
year
now
looks
more
likely
total
has
indicated
it
is
willing
to
partly
fund
the
project
the
pipeline
is
being
developed
as
a
public
private
partnership

uganda
has
crude
reserves
of
billion
barrels
in
the
albertine
rift
basin
along
its
border
with
the
democratic
republic
of
congo
muloni
said
the
success
rate
of
finding
oil
there
was
over
percent
and
the
cost
of
finding
oil
in
that
place
is
less
than
a
dollar
