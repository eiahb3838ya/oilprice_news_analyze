nvironmentalists
in
the
united
states
welcomed
the
election
of
candidates
promising
a
green
new
deal
but
cautioned
that
green
goals
would
be
hard
to
achieve
under
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
congress
will
include
four
new
representatives
who
campaigned
on
a
public
works
program
similar
to
president
franklin
roosevelt
s
new
deal
that
helped
end
the
depression
aimed
at
building
a
renewable
energy
economy
the
plan
will
need
to
be
packaged
differently
said
university
at
albany
political
scientist
brian
greenhill
given
trump
s
rollback
of
climate
regulations
and
his
dismissal
of
global
warming
as
a
hoax
i
can
t
imagine
under
the
trump
administration
that
anything
labeled
a
green
new
deal
would
be
successful
especially
if
it
s
framed
in
terms
of
climate
change
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
however
he
added
the
plan
seemed
like
a
after
recent
discussions
between
house
republicans
and
democrats
about
infrastructure
as
an
area
where
the
two
parties
could
find
common
ground
green
victories
came
amid
setbacks
in
colorado
arizona
and
washington
states
where
voters
rejected
initiatives
to
curb
fossil
fuels
by
restricting
drilling
putting
a
fee
on
carbon
emissions
and
mandating
the
wider
use
of
renewable
energy
jason
albertsons
a
director
at
the
nature
conservancy
said
that
despite
being
disappointed
by
the
rejection
of
those
state
measures
addressing
environmental
issues
by
creating
jobs
is
a
potential
path
to
success
the
most
vocal
champion
of
the
green
new
deal
has
been
alexandria
a
educator
who
won
a
seat
in
new
york
state
has
spoken
of
her
vision
of
the
green
new
deal
as
a
program
comparable
in
scale
to
the
marshall
plan
the
programmed
to
rebuild
western
europe
after
world
war
two
but
focused
on
renewable
energy
but
her
campaign
platform
contains
few
concrete
details
on
the
topic
and
her
representatives
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
further
information
other
candidates
