explainer-opec's challenge - to pump more oil while keeping deal in place
vienna
june
reuters
for
opec
with
its
deal
is
a
nice
problem
to
have
once
known
for
rampant
cheating
on
agreed
oil
output
targets
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
has
been
on
a
pact
in
place
since
january
cutting
around
one
and
a
half
times
the
promised
amount
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
meets
on
friday
to
decide
on
output
policy
amid
calls
from
major
consumers
such
as
the
united
states
india
and
china
to
cool
down
oil
prices
by
producing
more
crude
three
opec
members
iran
venezuela
and
iraq
have
been
reluctant
to
consent
to
a
formal
increase
in
opec
s
output
target
agreed
as
part
of
a
deal
with
russia
and
other
producers
and
running
until
the
end
of
but
on
wednesday
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
opec
members
that
had
on
cuts
should
return
to
compliance
with
agreed
quotas
a
possible
compromise
to
keep
both
the
existing
deal
and
produce
more
oil
if
all
opec
members
produced
as
much
as
they
were
allowed
under
the
deal
opec
output
would
in
theory
rise
by
about
barrels
per
day
based
on
reuters
estimates
of
the
group
s
production
in
may
but
in
practice
it
would
mean
a
much
smaller
boost
of
less
than
a
of
that
amount
effectively
from
saudi
arabia
riyadh
is
considered
the
only
opec
member
pumping
that
could
add
significantly
more
at
short
notice
while
saudi
arabia
s
cutting
by
more
than
required
has
helped
opec
s
compliance
involuntary
reductions
in
venezuela
amid
economic
crisis
and
in
angola
due
to
natural
decline
have
had
a
larger
impact
and
can
not
be
reversed
at
short
notice
so
a
larger
increase
agreed
by
opec
would
require
a
new
set
of
output
targets
this
could
reallocate
production
from
members
their
quotas
to
those
that
can
pump
more
namely
saudi
arabia
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
it
could
also
raise
targets
for
all
even
though
any
increase
would
come
from
only
a
few
members
so
far
there
is
no
indication
that
iran
and
the
other
members
would
agree
to
such
a
reallocation
although
with
officials
holding
extensive
talks
in
the
to
friday
s
opec
meeting
further
compromise
could
be
made
if
the
existing
deal
is
retained
and
saudi
arabia
felt
there
was
a
need
to
add
more
oil
riyadh
could
still
increase
production
unilaterally
as
it
did
after
a
meeting
in
june
ended
with
no
decision
