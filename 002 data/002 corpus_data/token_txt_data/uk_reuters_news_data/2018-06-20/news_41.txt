oil traders ready for musical chairs as china tariffs loom
new
york
june
reuters
oil
markets
are
bracing
for
a
reshuffle
of
global
trade
flows
as
china
threatens
to
impose
tariffs
on
imports
of
energy
products
including
crude
china
which
has
bought
an
average
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
oil
this
year
is
threatening
to
place
a
percent
tariff
on
various
commodity
exports
including
crude
oil
although
it
is
so
far
unclear
when
such
a
measure
would
come
in
place
the
decision
came
in
response
to
president
donald
trump
saying
he
was
pushing
ahead
with
hefty
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
imports
and
it
triggered
an
aggressive
response
by
trump
who
on
monday
threatened
to
slap
a
percent
tariff
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
in
addition
to
the
import
duties
previously
announced
the
tariffs
could
restrict
the
flow
of
barrels
going
to
china
a
business
now
worth
almost
billion
per
month
an
import
duty
would
make
oil
less
competitive
than
other
crudes
almost
certainly
resulting
in
a
sharp
fall
of
chinese
purchases
forcing
oil
firms
to
find
other
buyers
in
the
first
three
months
of
this
year
crude
made
up
around
percent
of
china
s
total
crude
imports
according
to
chinese
customs
data
it
ll
take
the
oil
industry
a
few
months
to
find
new
outlets
said
scott
shelton
a
broker
at
icap
in
durham
adding
that
crude
flows
to
europe
and
the
mediterranean
will
likely
pick
up
outside
china
however
wti
remains
at
a
per
barrel
discount
to
brent
many
traders
expect
this
discount
to
widen
further
should
the
flow
of
oil
to
china
slow
meaning
that
other
producers
would
have
to
deal
with
high
volumes
of
cheap
american
oil
becoming
available
in
other
big
markets
including
europe
china
in
turn
is
likely
to
replace
the
oil
with
increased
purchases
from
top
suppliers
russia
and
saudi
arabia
saudi
and
russia
are
already
pushing
for
an
increase
in
production
at
a
meeting
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
this
week
i
think
it
would
create
a
carousel
affect
where
china
then
buys
more
alternate
grades
and
other
importers
buy
more
grades
a
trader
with
a
global
merchant
said
the
united
states
where
oil
production
has
risen
by
almost
a
third
in
the
last
two
years
to
a
weekly
record
of
million
bpd
relies
heavily
on
exports
to
maintain
market
balance
exports
surged
to
an
unprecedented
million
bpd
in
april
from
million
bpd
in
march
european
countries
including
italy
and
the
netherlands
accounted
for
the
bulk
of
the
increase
in
april
crude
exports
some
traders
expect
barrels
to
get
trapped
if
the
dispute
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
turns
into
a
fully
blown
trade
war
which
in
turn
would
force
own
the
price
of
crude
even
further
there
is
going
to
be
a
sales
lull
that
will
keep
these
barrels
trapped
and
the
widening
of
the
spread
that
we
see
will
persist
and
get
worse
before
it
gets
better
said
john
kilduff
partner
at
again
capital
llc
in
new
york
for
china
the
world
s
biggest
importer
of
crude
oil
relatively
higher
brent
prices
means
oil
would
become
more
expensive
this
would
put
chinese
refiners
at
a
disadvantage
said
john
coleman
senior
analyst
of
north
american
crude
markets
at
wood
mackenzie
as
the
trade
dispute
between
washington
and
beijing
heats
up
the
world
s
top
oil
producers
are
set
to
gather
in
vienna
austria
on
june
to
set
global
output
strategy
producer
group
opec
which
is
effectively
led
by
saudi
arabia
has
been
withholding
supplies
since
to
prop
up
prices
together
with
members
like
top
producer
russia
russia
and
saudi
arabia
are
both
pushing
for
an
increase
in
output
to
make
up
for
losses
in
supplies
in
venezuela
as
well
as
looming
sanctions
against
iran
russia
s
flagship
urals
crude
oil
is
one
of
the
grades
preferred
by
china
s
independent
refiners
known
as
teapots
middle
east
flows
to
asian
countries
such
as
india
have
also
picked
up
over
the
past
two
months
as
brent
s
premium
over
the
dubai
benchmark
has
widened
middle
east
light
grades
such
as
murban
therefore
would
now
have
an
even
easier
time
finding
a
home
in
china
traders
said
overall
however
traders
do
not
expect
serious
supply
shortfalls
to
result
from
chinese
crude
tariffs
against
the
united
states
the
world
s
an
awfully
big
place
consuming
an
awful
lot
of
oil
so
you
may
not
have
it
that
much
harder
for
to
go
elsewhere
said
spencer
dale
chief
economist
at
oil
major
bp
you
may
see
some
differences
in
oil
flows
but
i
don
t
see
it
at
the
moment
as
a
source
of
major
disruption
some
of
that
oil
which
would
ve
been
supplied
by
into
china
will
go
elsewhere
