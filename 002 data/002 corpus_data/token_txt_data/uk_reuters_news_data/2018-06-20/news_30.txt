on
whether

buy
or
swedish
gripen
fighter
jets
to
replace
its
ageing
prime
minister
peter
pellegrini
said
on
wednesday
the
defence
ministry
was
originally
expected
to
submit
an
analysis
of
the
two
options
by
june
for
government
approval
but
pellegrini
said
it
was
too
big
a
decision
to
be
made
under
pressure
i
want
to
see
comparable
offers
to
eliminate
any
doubts
this
is
a
serious
decision
worth
billions
of
euros
he
said
slovakia
a
member
of

has
a
maintenance
contract
with
russia
for
its
until

million
euros
million
to
million
a
year
under
which
dozens
of
russian
technicians
are
based
at
a
slovak
military
air
base
will
need
to
be
extended
even
after
the
government
signs
a
deal
to
buy
new
jets
while
it
awaits
delivery
new
gripen
jets
would
take
to
months
to
deliver
while
may
take
until
around
said
jaroslav
nad
an
analyst
from
the
slovak
security
police
institute
both
options
would
be
a
step
forward
for
slovakia
however
there
has
been
no
public
debate
on
whether
the
country
needs
the
more
expensive
and
more
advanced
or
the
more
gripens
he
added
the
ministry
has
not
disclosed
the
purchase
and
maintenance
costs
of
the
jets
slovakia

gajdos
from
the
junior
coalition
nationalist
and
eurosceptic
sns
party
paused
the
talks
and
invited
other
bidders
that
sparked
criticism
from
coalition
partners
that
delays
in
closing
the
deal
would
prolong
slovakia
s
dependence
on
russia
saab
said
last
month
it
would
move
a
support
centre
from
sweden
to
slovakia
which
may
service
