update 7-iran signals compromise for modest rise in opec oil output
vienna
reuters
iran
signaled
on
wednesday
it
could
compromise
on
a
small
increase
in
opec
oil
output
when
the
group
meets
this
week
as
saudi
arabia
scrambled
to
convince
fellow
members
of
the
need
for
a
larger
rise
in
production
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
meets
on
friday
to
decide
output
policy
amid
calls
from
major
consumers
such
as
the
united
states
and
china
to
cool
down
oil
prices
and
support
the
global
economy
by
producing
more
crude
iran
said
on
tuesday
opec
was
unlikely
to
reach
a
deal
setting
the
stage
for
a
clash
with
kingpin
saudi
arabia
and
russia
which
are
pushing
to
raise
production
steeply
from
july
to
meet
growing
global
demand
but
on
wednesday
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
opec
members
that
had
overdelivered
on
cuts
in
recent
months
should
comply
with
agreed
quotas
that
would
effectively
mean
a
modest
boost
from
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
that
have
been
cutting
more
deeply
than
planned
despite
production
outages
in
venezuela
and
libya
opec
could
keep
the
same
deal
with
compliance
going
back
to
percent
said
an
opec
source
who
is
aware
of
iran
s
stance
opec
mohammad
barkindo
said
he
was
confident
there
would
be
a
deal
when
the
producer
group
meets
in
vienna
on
friday
russia
has
proposed
opec
and
producers
raise
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
effectively
wiping
out
existing
production
cuts
of
million
bpd
that
have
helped
rebalance
the
market
in
the
past
months
and
lifted
oil
to
per
barrel
oil
traded
as
low
as
in
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
also
said
on
wednesday
that
the
market
demanded
more
oil
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
and
that
opec
was
moving
toward
a
good
decision
ecuador
said
opec
and
its
allies
could
agree
to
a
compromise
increase
in
output
of
around
million
bpd
a
decision
to
increase
output
could
be
taken
even
with
iran
refusing
to
sign
up
as
has
happened
before
in
opec

addressing
iran
has
so
far
been
the
main
barrier
to
a
deal
with
zanganeh
saying
opec
should
not
yield
to
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
raise
output
he
said
trump
had
contributed
to
the
rise
in
prices
by
imposing
sanctions
on
opec
members
iran
and
venezuela
which
will
likely
lead
to
lower
exports
zanganeh
said
he
would
leave
vienna
on
friday
even
before
opec
holds
talks
with
producers
the
next
day
but
efforts
were
underway
on
wednesday
to
convince
iran
to
participate
in
a
deal
sources
said
saudi
arabia
did
not
want
to
be
seen
as
putting
too
much
pressure
on
iran
and
hence
russia
was
instead
trying
to
convince
tehran
zanganeh
was
due
to
attend
a
ministerial
committee
on
thursday
two
sources
said
iran
is
usually
not
part
of
the
committee
which
includes
russia
saudi
arabia
the
united
arab
emirates
oman
kuwait
algeria
and
venezuela
iraq
and
venezuela
have
also
opposed
a
relaxation
of
production
cuts
fearing
a
slump

prices

iraqi
oil
minister
jabar
said
on
wednesday
he
hoped
there
would
be
agreement
when
opec
meets
but
added
the
oil
market
has
not
reached
the
level
of
gulf
producers
usually
aligned
with
saudi
arabia
the
uae
kuwait
oman
and
bahrain
have
also
cautioned
against
a
large
output
increase
and
signaled
they
have
been
rattled
by
riyadh
s
close
coordination
with
russia
sources
have
said
gulf
oil
producers
views
still
differed
on
wednesday
on
how
much
to
increase
production
and
whether
such
a
move
should
be
gradual
sources
said
they
nevertheless
tried
to
bring
iran
on
board
for
a
deal
with
ministers
from
the
uae
kuwait
and
oman
meeting
zanganeh
on
wednesday
oman
s
oil
minister
mohammed
bin
hamad
said
he
believed
iran
would
agree
to
an
output
increase
on
friday
he
said
the
meeting
would
tackle
with
oil
output
cuts
and
that
iran
was
very
cooperative
