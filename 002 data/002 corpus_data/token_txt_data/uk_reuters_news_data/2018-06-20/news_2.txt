operators

lack

said
this

that
overall
permian
output
could
flatten
in
the
period
ending
september
when
proposed

are
completed
a
lot
of
independents
will
have
to
actually
shut
in

in
the
permian
to
make
room
for
our
growth
sheffield
said
referring

other

space
the
number
of
active
drilling
rigs
in
the

last

fell
by
four
to
and
another
measure
of
activity
well
completions
fell
to
last
week
from
according
to
researcher
primary
vision
we
think
the
number
of
completions
in
the
basin
does
need
to
come
down
said
colin

bernstein
discovery
operating
a
small

currently
plans
to
send
a
drilling
rig
into
the
midland
basin
but
if
regional
oil
prices
fall
below
a
barrel
the
company
will
put
the
move
on
hold
said
jeff
sparks
discovery
s
chief
operating
officer
if
we
re
in
the
middle
of
drilling
we
might
end
up
with
some
uncompleted
wells
