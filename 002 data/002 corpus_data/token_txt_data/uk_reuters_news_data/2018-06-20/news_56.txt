new
york
reuters
chinese
manufacturer
jinkosolar
holding
co
ltd
expects
to
start
manufacturing
solar
panels
at
a
new
factory
in
jacksonville
florida
by
the
fourth
quarter
and
production
will
not
be
affected
by
the
latest
round
of
tariffs
on
chinese
products
a
company
executive
said
on
tuesday
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
on
monday
threatened
to
slap
a
percent
tariff
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
in
addition
to
import
duties
previously
announced
on
billion
in
goods
deepening
a
trade
conflict
that
has
hit
financial
markets
and
has
led
beijing
to
vow
a
firm
response
jeff
juger
business
development
director
of
jinkosolar
said
the
billion
in
tariffs
on
chinese
products
do
not
impact
our
operation
in
florida
because
all
the
cells
we
re
going
to
import
to
the
plant
come
from
and
to
deal
with
tariffs
imposed
by
the
trump
administration
on
imported
solar
panels
earlier
this
year
juger
said
the
florida
plant
would
take
advantage
of
an
exemption
that
allows
manufacturers
to
import
gigawatts
of
cells
for
use
in
manufacturing
solar
modules
at
american
plants
the
gigawatt
exemption
gives
us
quite
a
bit
of
headroom
to
import
cells
he
said
on
a
panel
at
the
renewable
energy
finance
forum
in
new
york
speaking
to
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
the
conference
juger
said
jinkosolar
has
also
applied
for
an
exclusion
to
the
cell
import
tariffs
that
would
allow
it
to
import
a
solar
cell
it
makes
in
malaysia
for
use
in
building
solar
modules
at
its
florida
factory
he
said
he
is
hopeful
the
administration
will
grant
the
exemption
because
jinkosolar
is
the
only
manufacturer
in
the
world
that
makes
the
cell
in
question
if
the
government
grants
that
exclusion
request
and
lets
us
import
these
cells
it
will
allow
us
to
further
scale
up
the
factory
in
florida
he
said
the
jacksonville
factory
will
employ
more
than
workers
he
said
adding
that
coping
with
tariffs
and
trade
issues
has
been
part
of
jinkosolar
s
business
for
years
we
just
have
to
persevere
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
juger
said
the
decision
to
invest
in
the
florida
factory
is
a
testament
to
our
commitment
to
the

the
