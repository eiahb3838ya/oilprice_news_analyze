for opec, oil tariff spat is short-term gain, long-term pain
vienna
reuters
opec
which
has
lost
chinese
market
share
to
oil
producers
should
in
theory
view
a
tariff
spat
between
beijing
and
washington
as
a
boon
but
while
opec
can
sell
more
oil
to
china
as
a
result
of
import
tariffs
on
crude
in
the
long
term
the
trade
dispute
could
hit
economic
growth
and
oil
demand
opec
officials
and
oil
executives
said
in
the
long
term
this
will
have
a
negative
effect
on
the
global
economy
even
if
in
the
short
term
it
might
be
positive
for
other
producers
austrian
oil
company
omv
s
chief
executive
rainer
seele
said
on
the
sidelines
of
an
opec
seminar
in
vienna
in
the
president
donald
trump
s
policies
will
weigh
on
the
global
a
trade
spat
between
the
and
china
escalated
last
week
with
china
threatening
to
slap
a
percent
tariff
on
billion
worth
of
goods
including
oil
and
refined
products
trade
wars
are
not
good
news
for
the
world
economy
total
s
chief
executive
patrick
pouyanne
told
the
seminar
pouyanne
said
it
was
also
not
good
news
to
see
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminum
which
could
impact
the
costs
of
oil
company
investments
so
i
think
all
that
is
part
of
what
opec
ministers
should
keep
in
oil
executives
are
meeting
opec
ministers
this
week
ahead
of
an
opec
gathering
on
friday
which
is
set
to
decide
on
new
output
policies
president
donald
trump
has
called
on
opec
to
raise
production
to
cool
down
oil
prices
china
has
been
the
largest
asian
buyer
of
crude
with
exports
booming
thanks
to
the
country
s
shale
revolution
oil
exports
to
china
exceed
barrels
per
day
and
compete
with
opec
suppliers
such
as
african
producers
of
light
crude
including
nigeria
angola
and
algeria
for
sure
it
is
good
news
for
algerian
crude
an
algerian
oil
source
said
when
asked
about
the
impact
of
the
trade
spat
new
tariffs
will
support
flow
from
others
sources
starting
from
the
fourth
quarter
it
is
also
a
period
of
robust
demand
in
china
the
source
said
asking
not
to
be
named
because
he
is
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
press
an
opec
source
said
he
believed
chinese
buyers
would
increase
purchases
of
light
crude
grades
from
other
opec
members
such
as
saudi
arabia
kuwait
iraq
the
uae
and
even
iran
but
in
the
long
run
it
is
not
helpful
it
is
destructive
for
the
global
economy
the
opec
source
said
referring
to
the
dispute
majid
jafar
chief
executive
of
crescent
petroleum
said
beyond
targeting
of
oil
exports
oil
producers
need
to
be
concerned
about
how
potential
major
disruption
to
the
global
trade
and
economic
systems
could
harm
demand
over
the
longer
jamie
webster
analyst
from
boston
consulting
group
also
said
that
even
though
chinese
tariffs
represented
an
opportunity
for
opec
to
sell
more
crude
they
also
created
more
oversupply
in
the
united
states
potentially
pushing
oil
prices
down
bp
s
chief
executive
bob
dudley
said
he
did
not
believe
the
trade
spat
could
tilt
the
global
economy
into
a
recession
i
think
when
you
put
sanctions
and
tariffs
the
world
will
respond
and
figure
out
ways
around
it
and
i
think
the
demand
for
energy
will
scott
sheffield
executive
chairman
of
oil
producer
pioneer
said
he
has
not
discussed
new
tariffs
either
with
the
white
house
or
opec
and
said
he
believed
crude
exports
were
set
to
grow
to
million
bpd
in
next
several
years
from
the
current
million
bpd
hopefully
we
can
find
another
home
for
that
oil
he
said
adding
that
singapore
south
korea
japan
and
the
european
union
could
mop
up
what
china
does
not
take
