vedanta
ltd
said
on
wednesday
a
sulphuric
acid
leak
from
a
tank
at
its
southern
indian
copper
smelter
was
severe
and
inaction
could
lead
to
serious
environmental
consequences
the
district
administration
had
said
on
sunday
the
leak
was
minor
and
steps
were
being
taken
to
empty
the
storage
tanks
as
a
safety
precaution
there
is
a
severe
leakage
in
the
pipe
flanges
and
the
pipe
flanges
are
submerged
in
the
acid
pool
collected
in
the
dykes
around
the
acid
storage
tank
the
company
said
in
a
petition
to
the
madras
high
court
vedanta
the
indian
subsidiary
of
vedanta
resources
said
it
sought
a
limited
reconnection
of
the
electricity
supply
for
maintenance
to
guard
against
a
potential
loss
of
life
and
damage
to
air
and
ground
water
there
is
a
grave
risk
and
danger
as
there
are
other
tanks
and
there
are
flammable
chemicals
and
materials
within
the
plant
area
it
said
however
the
district
s
top
administrative
official
sandeep
nanduri
stuck
to
the
earlier
view
that
the
leak
was
minor
that
is
their
version
and
this
is
ours
however
we
are
completely
evacuating
the
sulphuric
acid
from
all
tanks
as
a
safety
precaution
said
nanduri
the
tamil
nadu
state
government
ordered
a
permanent
closure
of
the
plant
and
disconnected
the
power
supply
last
month
following
protests
that
turned
violent
and
culminated
in
the
police
opening
fire
on
protesters
killing
of
them
the
protesters
demanded
a
permanent
shutdown
of
the
plant
which
they
said
was
causing
air
and
water
pollution
locals
and
activists
see
the
smelter
as
a
risk
to
fisheries
vedanta
says
the
protests
are
based
on
false
notions
vedanta
also
said
it
was
unable
to
meet
government
officials
because
of
the
tense
situation
prevailing
after
the
protests
a
senior
state
minister
told
reuters
in
an
interview
early
this
month
that
there
was
no
question
of
engaging
with
the
company
and
the
plant
will
remain
shut
the
smelter
which
has
been
shut
for
about
three
months
annually
produces
about
a
million
tonnes
of
sulphuric
acid
a
corrosive
byproduct
of
copper
smelting
used
as
a
raw
material
by
the
fertiliser
industry
it
accounted
for
over
a
third
of
india
s
refined
copper
production
and
employed
over
people
the
company
plans
to
appeal
the
government
s
move
to
shut
the
plant
