britain
s
biggest
labour
union
is
balloting
rig
workers
at
three
of
total
s
north
sea
oil
platforms
over
a
potential
strike
due
to
the
company
s
refusal
to
reduce
the
number
of
unpaid
working
days
the
union
said
on
wednesday
after
the
oil
price
crash
in
the
workers
agreed
to
work
an
extra
days
unpaid
to
help
the
company
during
the
downturn
wullie
wallace
regional
officer
of
unite
the
union
said
however
with
the
recovery
in
oil
prices
to
around
a
barrel
their
highest
in
over
three
years
the
workers
want
to
return
to
the
previous
system
which
total
has
so
far
refused
the
ballot
will
end
on
june
and
any
industrial
action
would
affect
oil
output
from
the
alwyn
dunbar
and
platforms
most
of
which
feeds
into
the
key
forties
crude
stream
some
also
contributes
to
the
benchmark
brent
grade
wallace
said
industrial
action
could
take
two
forms
an
end
to
working
overtime
or
a
series
of
strikes
which
would
affect
output
the
workers
include
those
in
the
control
room
and
production
technicians
an
output
disruption
could
impact
the
global
oil
market
as
the
price
of
forties
crude
is
one
of
the
five
grades
used
to
set
the
dated
brent
benchmark
which
is
in
turn
used
to
price
the
bulk
of
the
world
s
oil
trades
around
one
fifth
of
all
north
sea
oil
comes
from
the
forties
crude
stream
the
company
has
rejected
unite
s
proposal
to
reduce
the
number
of
days
worked
offshore
the
days
were
given
up
for
no
extra
payments
in
order
to
assist
total
e
p
uk
at
the
height
of
the
downturn
unite
said
in
a
statement
instead
the
union
said
the
company
had
proposed
a
new
system
of
work
shifts
versus
the
traditional
two
weeks
which
would
bring
the
number
of
extra
days
to
no
one
should
be
expected
to
work
twenty
one
days
in
a
row
working
twelve
hour
shifts
being
pushed
to
the
limits
of
what
is
safe
mentally
and
physically
wallace
said
in
the
statement
total
said
it
was
consulting
with
its
workforce
and
the
proposed
rota
change
was
prompted
by
its
acquisition
of
maersk
oil
that
completed
in
march
the
purchase
made
total
the
second
largest
operator
in
the
north
sea
following
the
recent
acquisition
of
maersk
oil
we
now
have
a
number
of
different
rotas
across
our
worksites
and
we
would
like
to
introduce
a
uniform
system
a
total
spokeswoman
said
unite
said
the
industry
has
been
gradually
shifting
to
longer
shifts
and
that
raised
the
likelihood
of
health
problems
the
three
off
rota
pattern
is
now
worked
by
percent
of
the
workforce
offshore
compared
with
just
percent
working
the
same
pattern
in
it
said
the
world
s
top
oil
companies
had
to
make
drastic
cuts
during
the
oil
price
downturn
their
balance
sheets
showed
a
recovery
last
year
while
in
the
majors
are
expected
to
generate
more
cash
than
at
any
time
this
decade
total
recovered
faster
than
some
of
its
competitors
