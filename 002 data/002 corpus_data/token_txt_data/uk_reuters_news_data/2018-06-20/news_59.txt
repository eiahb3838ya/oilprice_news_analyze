oil
prices
rose
in
early
asian
trading
on
wednesday
supported
by
a
drop
in
commercial
crude
inventories
reported
by
the
american
petroleum
institute
api
crude
inventories
fell
by
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
june
to
million
barrels
according
to
the
weekly
api
report
published
on
tuesday
brent
crude
futures
the
international
benchmark
for
oil
prices
were
at
per
barrel
at
gmt
up
cents
or
percent
from
their
last
close
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
futures
were
at
a
barrel
up
cents
or
percent
looming
large
over
markets
however
was
a
june
meeting
in
vienna
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
together
with
some
other
producers
including
russia
to
discuss
forward
supply
policy
opec
leader
and
top
crude
exporter
saudi
arabia
as
well
as
russia
which
is
not
a
member
of
the
cartel
but
the
world
s
biggest
oil
producer
are
pushing
for
looser
supply
controls
which
were
introduced
in
to
prop
up
prices
other
including
iran
are
against
such
a
move
fearing
a
sharp
slump
in
prices
saudi
arabia
and
russia
continued
to
push
for
a
relaxation
in
production
constraints
going
against
many
other
members
wishes
anz
bank
said
on
wednesday
iran
rejected
a
potential
compromise
saying
it
won
t
support
even
a
small
increase
in
oil
production
this
puts
saudi
arabia
in
a
tough
position
as
unanimity
is
needed
for
any
accord
to
be
reached
it
added
jack
allardyce
oil
and
gas
research
analyst
at
cantor
fitzgerald
europe
said
he
had
the
expectation
that
supply
quotas
will
be
increased
but
probably
more
in
line
with
the
smaller
range
being
quoted
barrels
per
day
given
the
lack
of
consensus
amongst
opec
allardyce
said
we
could
see
this
knocking
per
barrel
off
brent
and
perhaps
squeezing
the
wti
discount
a
markets
were
also
anxiously
watching
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
china
in
which
both
sides
have
threatened
to
impose
stiff
duties
on
each
other
s
export
products
including
crude
oil
a
percent
tariff
on
crude
oil
imports
as
threatened
by
china
in
retaliation
for
duties
washington
has
announced
but
not
yet
implemented
against
chinese
products
would
make
american
crude
uncompetitive
in
china
versus
other
supplies
this
would
almost
certainly
lead
to
a
sharp
in
chinese
purchases
of
crude
which
have
boomed
in
the
last
two
years
to
a
business
now
worth
around
billion
per
month
