the
european
union
on
wednesday
finalised
new
climate
rules
after
months
of
talks
targeting
a
total
energy
saving
of
percent
and
an
uplift
in
the
share
of
renewable
energy
to
percent
by
national
governments
must
now
draft
their
own
plans
for
implementing
the
bloc
s
overall
climate
goal
of
lowering
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
at
least
percent
below
levels
by
in
line
with
the
paris
agreement
talks
have
dragged
on
for
months
to
reach
a
compromise
between
the
european
parliament
and
eu
member
states
on
the
new
energy
efficiency
and
renewable
energy
targets
after
as
well
as
the
rules
governing
implementation
a
push
by
lawmakers
for
more
ambitious
targets
and
tougher
monitoring
of
efforts
met
with
resistance
from
member
states
wary
of
the
economic
impact
of
efforts
to
reduce
emissions
environmental
groups
and
green
group
lawmakers
warned
the
agreement
still
falls
short
of
the
paris
agreement
s
pledge
to
keep
global
warming
well
below
degrees
the
measures
are
not
enough
for
the
eu
to
fulfill
its
commitments
under
the
paris
agreement
green
parliamentarian
benedek
javor
said
they
will
need
to
be
strengthened
in
time
if
we
are
to
meet
our
climate
the
final
deal
includes
a
clause
allowing
for
the
bloc
to
revise
up

there
