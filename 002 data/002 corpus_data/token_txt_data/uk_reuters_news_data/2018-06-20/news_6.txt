iran
may
agree
to
an
increase
in
oil
output
by
opec
and
its
allies
through
producers
who
have
overdelivered
on
cuts
moving
up
to
their
quotas
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
in
an
interview
with
cnn
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
russia
and
several
other
producers
had
agreed
to
cut
output
by
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
starting
from
january
the
agreement
has
driven
down
inventories
and
pushed
up
oil
prices
however
a
number
of
producers
including
saudi
arabia
have
been
cutting
more
deeply
than
planned
despite
outages
in
venezuela
and
libya
meaning
they
could
modestly
boost
output
while
complying
with
their
quotas
the
compliance
or
i
say
is
close
to
in
recent
months
percent
it
doesn
t
need
any
agreement
or
resolution
from
opec
to
comply
percent
zanganeh
said
bringing
compliance
to
percent
from
current
levels
would
mean
adding
at
least
million
bpd
of
crude
to
the
market
sources
have
said
opec
meets
on
friday
to
decide
output
policy
amid
calls
from
major
consumers
such
as
the
united
states
and
china
to
cool
down
oil
prices
and
support
the
global
economy
by
producing
more
crude
zanganeh
said
opec
members
are
discussing
about
going
back
to
percent
compliance
and
they
could
agree
to
increase
supply
at
the
meeting
without
the
need
for
new
agreement
or
resolution
