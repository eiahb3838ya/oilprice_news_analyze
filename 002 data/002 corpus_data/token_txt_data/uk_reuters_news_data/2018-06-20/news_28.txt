london

reuters
the
united
kingdom
needs
to
urgently
give
clarity
on
how
trade
with
the
european
union
will
work
after
brexit
and
the
world
s
fifth
largest
economy
should
remain
in
the
customs
union
unless
there
is
a
proper
alternative
the
boss
of
siemens
uk
said
with
nine
months
until
the
united
kingdom
is
due
to
leave
the
eu
on
march
little
is
clear
about
how
trade
will
flow
as
prime
minister
theresa
may
who
is
grappling
with
a
rebellion
in
her
party
is
still
trying
to
strike
a
deal
with
the
bloc
my
biggest
worry
about
brexit
is
that
i
don
t
know
what
we
are
planning
for
juergen
maier
the
uk
ceo
of
siemens
told
reuters
in
an
interview
we
need
to
put
something
in
place
quickly
that
works
and
if
that
is
not
possible
and
until
that
point
then
we
have
to
just
default
to
staying
in
the
customs
union
maier
said
the
uk
has
ruled
out
staying
in
the
eu
customs
union
which
clubs
eu
members
in
a
area
where
there
is
a
common
import
tariff
for
goods
but
the
nature
of
its
future
trading
relationship
with
the
world
s
biggest
trading
bloc
has
split
may
s
government
and
conservative
party
under
the
current
timetable
both
london
and
brussels
are
working
towards
a
final
brexit
deal
in
october
to
give
enough
time
to
ratify
it
by
brexit
day
in
march
we
ship
thousands
of
goods
daily
across
the
borders
that
help
keep
power
stations
running
that
help
keep
trains
running
that
help
keep
british
manufacturing
running
are
those
parts
going
to
be
able
to
pass
pretty
frictionlessly
over
the
border
maier
said
or
are
we
going
to
be
in
a
situation
where
we
have
supply
chains
that
are
struggling
to
deliver
to
us
and
where
we
are
struggling
to
export
from
the
uk
