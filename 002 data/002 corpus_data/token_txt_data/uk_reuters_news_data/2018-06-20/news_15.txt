update 1-cities face dramatic rise in heat, flood risks by 2050, researchers say

in
the
next
years
cities
around
the
world
will
face
dramatically
higher
risks
from
extreme
heat
coastal
flooding
power
blackouts
and
food
and
water
shortages
unless
emissions
are
curbed
urban
researchers
warned
currently
more
than
million
people
in
cities
face
average
daily
peak
temperatures
of
at
least
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
for
three
months
a
year
according
to
a
study
by
cities
a
network
of
cities
pushing
climate
action
but
by
more
than
billion
people
in
cities
will
face
those
conditions
researchers
predicted
the
number
of
people
in
poverty
and
battling
brutal
heat
usually
without
air
conditioning
will
rise
tenfold
they
said
this
is
a
call
said
kevin
austin
deputy
executive
director
of
cities
at
a
meeting
in
cape
town
this
week
on
adapting
to
climate
change
the
magnitude
of
people
affected
by
heat
will
be
much
greater
than
today
if
we
continue
to
increase
greenhouse
gases
at
this
with
experts
at
the
meeting
predicting
extreme
weather
such
as
heavy
rainfall
and
flooding
could
trigger
everything
from
disease
outbreaks
to
road
failures
food
shortages
and
closed
schools
austin
said
cities
must
take
direct
action
to
curb
risks
as
well
as
cut
emissions
in
seoul
for
example
an
elevated
thoroughfare
through
the
centre
of
the
city
has
been
removed
opening
up
access
to
the
river
and
lowering
heat
by
at
least
half
a
degree
he
said
south
korea
s
capital
also
has
planted
more
than
million
trees
and
created
shaded
cooling
centres
we
want
to
encourage
cities
to
adopt
more
of
these
solutions
and
implement
them
as
quickly
as
possible
austin
said
the
research
carried
out
by
the
new
urban
climate
change
research
network
looked
at
data
from
more
than
cities
and
predicted
likely
conditions
if
emissions
continue
to
rise
at
their
current
rate
it
found
that
cape
town
s
ongoing
battle
with
water
shortages
could
become
far
more
common
with
over
million
people
in
cities
among
them
sao
paulo
and
tehran
likely
to
see
their
access
to
water
reduced
by
many
cities
are
already
aiming
to
cap
water
use
per
person
with
los
angeles
pushing
for
litres
a
day
melbourne
for
litres
and
cape
town
a
dramatically
reduced
austin
said
the
geological
survey
estimates
that
an
average
american
today
uses
at
least
litres
of
water
per
day
austin
said
sharing
advice
on
how
to
make
cuts
including
insights
gained
in
cape
town
which
has
slashed
its
water
use
by
half
in
the
face
of
extreme
drought
can
save
cities
time
cape
town
mayor
patricia
de
lille
said
dealing
with
a
crisis
when
it
arrives
leaves
little
room
to
manoeuvre
in
a
crisis
like
this
there
is
no
time
to
go
by
trial
and
error
you
unfortunately
have
to
get
it
right
the
first
time
she
said
at
the
adaptation
futures
conference
in
cape
town
the
cities
study
also
found
that
by
over
million
people
will
live
in
coastal
cities
at
risk
of
flooding
from
weather
extremes
and
sea
level
rise
flooding
presents
a
particular
risk
to
urban
power
supplies
with
many
power
stations
located
in
areas
putting
everything
from
transportation
to
heating
and
hospitals
at
risk
decentralising
power
systems
including
by
getting
clean
energy
from
a
larger
number
of
smaller
power
plants
could
help
cut
the
risks
researchers
said
but
flooding
risks
may
be
coming
faster
than
expected
patrick
child
the
european
commission
s
deputy
for
research
and
innovation
said
a
predicted
one
metre
foot
rise
in
sea
levels
once
anticipated
by
is
now
likely
by
last
year
saw
the
documented
economic
losses
from
severe
weather
and
climate
change
globally
he
said
flooding
as
well
as
water
scarcity
are
two
of
the
biggest
challenges
facing
cities
said
jeff
hebert
vice
president
for
adaptation
and
resilience
at
the
water
institute
of
the
gulf
and
former
chief
resilience
officer
of
new
orleans
cities
are
constantly
having
to
navigate
between
the
extremes
of
too
much
water
or
not
enough
of
it
hebert
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
an
interview
in
london
looking
at
just
one
type
of
problem
such
as
a
health
threats
from
extreme
heat
or
sea
level
rise
also
isn
t
enough
to
capture
the
risks
said
cynthia
rosenzweig
a
climatologist
at
the
nasa
goddard
institute
for
space
studies
and
one
of
the
authors
of
the
report
in
cities
all
of
these
impacts
interact
with
each
other
and
are
all
happening
at
the
same
time
she
said
solutions
also
need
combined
approaches
with
engineering
efforts
to
cut
flooding
for
instance
working
hand
in
hand
with
things
like
better
protection
of
wetlands
rosenzweig
said
rosenzweig
said
she
hoped
the
research
would
help
city
officials
prioritise
what
changes
need
to
happen
first
to
better
protect
their
citizens
in
cities
it
often
overwhelming
with
so
many
things
to
do
