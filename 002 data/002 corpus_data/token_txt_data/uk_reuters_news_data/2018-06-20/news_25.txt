foreign
utilities
with
contracts
to
sell
electricity
at
tariffs
guaranteed
by
the
government
of
around
euros
per
megawatt
mw
for
years
but
public
opposition
to
wind
farms
has
long
delayed
the

and
since
then
prices
for
international
offshore
wind
power
have
more
than
halved

energy
regulator

has
said
the

were
too
costly

adding
up
to
nearly
billion
euros
billion
we
will
bring
about
renewable
energy
more
quickly
and
less
expensively
the
projects
are
confirmed
their
public
subsidy
is
reduced
by

french
president

said
on

confirming
earlier
tweets
by
two
utility
executives
environment
minister
nicolas

that
the

from

in

the

had
proposed
renegotiating

possibly
canceling

for
a
combined
megawatts
of
offshore
wind
on
six
sites
on
france
s

the
renewable
energy
industry
has
been
sharply
critical
of
the

reneging
on
its
contract
saying
that
they
are
not
to
blame
for
the
delays
when
france
awarded
the
tenders
at
what
even
then
were
relatively
high
prices
it
wanted
firms
areva
and
alstom
to
deliver
wind
turbines
for
the
projects
and
thus
launch
a
french
offshore
wind
industry
to
compete
with
denmark
s
vestas
and
germany
s
siemens
but
since
then
the
two
french
firms
wind
turbine
activities
have
been
bought
by
foreign
companies
areva
s
by
siemens
and
gamesa
and
alstom
s
by
ge
and
france
has
had
to
drop
its
dream
of
developing
a
french
offshore
wind
industry
ge
said
in
a
statement
it
welcomed
the
government
s
decision
to
go
ahead
with
the
projects
which
it
said
would
create
jobs
and
economic
growth
