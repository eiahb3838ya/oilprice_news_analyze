london
reuters
hyundai
agreed
a
deal
with
audi
on
wednesday
to
collaborate
on
hydrogen
car
technology
hoping
to
boost
an
energy
segment
that
has
lagged
behind
battery
electric
vehicles
the
south
korean
firm
wants
to
increase
the
uptake
of
hydrogen
cars
which
are
propelled
by
electricity
generated
by
fuel
cells
but
have
been
held
back
by
a
lack
of
infrastructure
and
the
push
for
battery
electric
vehicles
by
the
likes
of
tesla
the
pair
will
be
able
to
access
each
other
s
intellectual
property
and
share
components
including
any
new
parts
developed
by
audi
which
is
responsible
for
hydrogen
fuel
cell
technology
in
the
volkswagen
group
the
world
s
biggest
car
seller
hyundai
hopes
that
the
move
will
create
greater
demand
for
vehicles
such
as
its
model
and
bring
down
costs
to
make
the
technology
profitable
we
want
to
provide
to
our
component
suppliers
more
chance
and
we
want
to
have
competition
between
component
suppliers
sae
hoon
kim
the
head
of
hyundai
s
r
d
fuel
cell
group
told
reuters
in
an
interview
in
london
we
also
want
to
make
them
to
have
competition
with
other
suppliers
and
that
competition
will
bring
down
the
carmakers
such
as
toyota
have
touted
the
benefits
of
hydrogen
vehicles
which
take
less
time
to
refuel
than
the
recharge
times
of
battery
electric
cars
but
are
expensive
and
suffer
from
a
lack
of
refuelling
stations
many
carmakers
are
focusing
on
battery
electric
vehicles
which
can
take
between
half
an
hour
and
half
a
day
to
recharge
but
are
increasingly
able
to
use
a
growing
network
of
charging
points
auto
firms
are
teaming
up
to
share
the
cost
of
developing
greener
technologies
to
replace
combustion
engines
as
regulators
around
the
world
crack
down
on
emissions
gm
and
honda
have
a
partnership
to
jointly
develop
electric
vehicles
with
hydrogen
fuel
cells
that
are
expected
to
go
on
sale
in
while
bmw
is
working
with
toyota
kim
said
that
a
toughening
of
european
union
carbon
emission
limits
in
would
create
a
need
for
more
hydrogen
cars
hyundai
sold
such
models
last
year
and
expects
to
sell
thousands
this
year
but
kim
said
profitability
was
still
far
off
or
vehicles
per
year
per
company
when
that
comes
i
think
we
can
make
money
