world
stocks
steadied
near
lows
on
wednesday
and
chinese
markets
bounced
after
recent
sharp
falls
as
expectations
grew
that
policy
stimulus
by
beijing
could
temper
some
of
the
impact
from
an
escalating
trade
conflict
the
dollar
too
eased
off
highs
against
a
currency
basket
wall
street
looked
set
for
a
stronger
opening
and
msci
s
equity
index
snapped
a
run
of
losses
rising
percent
its
rebound
was
fuelled
by
a
bounce
of
almost
one
percent
in
msci
s
asian
shares
off
lows
following
gains
in
hong
kong
seoul
and
mainland
chinese
indexes
assets
perceived
to
be
safe
such
as
the
yen
swiss
franc
and
the
government
bonds
of
germany
and
the
united
states
took
a
step
back
after
hefty
recent
rallies
i
suspect
such
as
bunds
and
treasuries
could
be
put
to
the
test
as
risk
sentiment
shows
signs
of
stabilising
commerzbank
strategist
rainer
guntermann
said
one
catalyst
appeared
to
be
a
paper
from
china
s
central
bank
which
suggested
cutting
banks
reserve
requirement
ratios
rrr
which
would
boost
market
liquidity
and
loosen
monetary
conditions
analysts
said
an
rrr
cut
appeared
now
to
be
a
matter
of
time
the
central
bank
also
fixed
the
yuan
s
exchange
rate
a
touch
higher
against
the
dollar
after
the
currency
posted
its
biggest
daily
loss
in
years
however
worries
of
a
fully
fledged
trade
war
between
the
two
biggest
world
economies
remain
washington
is
threatening
tariffs
on
billion
more
of
chinese
goods
and
a
white
house
trade
adviser
said
beijing
was
underestimating
president
donald
trump
s
resolve
to
impose
more
tariffs
an
escalation
in
tariffs
would
hit
hard
world
growth
company
profits
and
price
stability
at
a
time
when
several
big
central
banks
notably
federal
reserve
are
in
policy
tightening
mode
the
asian
equity
gains
encouraged
european
bourses
to
open
higher
with
a
index
up
percent
after
slumping
on
tuesday
to
lows
however
an
index
of
auto
shares
a
sector
highly
vulnerable
to
tariffs
stayed
in
negative
territory
equity
futures
for
new
york
s
s
index
rose
percent
a
day
after
stocks
fell
sharply
at
the
end
of
the
day
all
these
circumstances
including
trade
wars
have
been
in
play
for
a
while
and
the
market
reacts
sharply
from
time
to
time
said
francois
savary
chief
investment
officer
at
swiss
wealth
manager
prime
partners
he
cautioned
however
against
pushing
the
equity
rally
too
far
the
framework
is
set
there
is
monetary
policy
tightening
less
liquidity
more
uncertainty
and
an
economic
situation
which
in
europe
at
least
we
need
to
be
more
cautious
as
the
bid
for
safety
abated
yields
on
treasury
notes
rose
above
percent
after
touching
low
around
percent
and
german
yields
also
inched
higher
euro
zone
yields
have
been
pushed
lower
almost
across
the
board
this
week
on
back
of
the
trade
tensions
but
also
on
slowing
growth
momentum
across
the
bloc
and
a
central
bank
which
has
pushed
back
the
timing
of
its
first
interest
rate
rise
in
this
cycle
by
several
months
all
that
has
also
hit
the
euro
which
slipped
percent
to
the
dollar
staying
near
lows
of
hit
after
european
central
bank
chief
mario
draghi
called
on
tuesday
for
a
patient
approach
to
monetary
policy
draghi
had
been
speaking
at
a
banking
forum
in
sintra
portugal
where
he
is
due
to
appear
again
on

alongside

was
struggling
near
a
low

of
a
crucial
vote
in
parliament
over
the
country
s
european
union
withdrawal
process
however
as
the

stalled
emerging

such

that

the

in

we
don

look
for
