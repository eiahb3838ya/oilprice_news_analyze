nigeria
s
president
signed
a
record
billion
budget
for
into
law
on
wednesday
but
said
he
would
use
a
supplementary
spending
plan
to
seek
changes
creating
uncertainty
about
the
final
details
of
his
growth
strategy
muhammadu
buhari
is
pushing
to
foster
growth
in
nigeria
which
has
west
africa
s
biggest
economy
before
an
election
next
february
in
which
he
will
seek
a
second
term
his
economic
policies
and
their
impact
on
nigerians
could
sway
voters
nigeria
s
parliament
the
national
assembly
passed
the
budget
last
month
the
total
sum
is
higher
than
the
trillion
naira
spending
plan
presented
to
parliament
by
buhari
in
november
which
lawmakers
said
was
due
to
an
increase
in
the
assumed
oil
price
to
per
barrel
from
buhari
was
critical
of
changes
made
by
the
national
assembly
which
he
said
cut
a
total
of
billion
naira
for
projects
submitted
to
them
for
consideration
and
introduced
projects
of
their
own
amounting
to
billion
naira
he
cited
examples
of
funds
being
cut
including
billion
taken
from
a
housing
programme
and
said
lawmakers
added
projects
that
were
not
properly
assessed
buhari
also
said
parliament
increased
its
own
budget
from
billion
naira
to
billion
naira
i
have
decided
to
sign
the
budget
in
order
not
to
further
slowdown
the
pace
of
recovery
of
our
economy
which
has
doubtlessly
been
affected
by
the
delay
in
passing
the
budget
said
buhari
in
a
speech
after
the
signing
nigeria
africa
s
top
oil
producer
emerged
from
its
first
recession
in
years
in
helped
by
higher
crude
prices
but
growth
remains
fragile
it
is
my
intention
to
seek
to
remedy
some
of
the
most
critical
of
these
issues
through
a
supplementary
amendment
budget
which
i
hope
the
national
assembly
will
be
able
to
expeditiously
consider
buhari
said
a
spokesman
for
the
lower
house
of
parliament
the
house
of
representatives
said
some
projects
put
forward
by
the
executive
do
not
meet
the
needs
of
the
common
man
and
the
legislature
aimed
to
help
those
it
represents
the
additional
costs
and
projects
to
the
budget
were
done
in
good
faith
for
the
sole
purpose
of
improving
the
lives
of
nigerians
said
the
spokesman
abdulrazak
namdas
a
spokesmen
for
the
upper
house
of
parliament
could
not
immediately
be
reached
budgets
under
buhari
who
took
office
in
may
have
been
nigeria
s
largest
ever
the
latest
is
up
from
last
year
s
spending
plan
but
economists
say
implementation
has
been
poor
and
failed
to
provide
the
type
of
capital
spending
needed
to
improve
infrastructure
despite
the
approach
of
elections
in
early
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
this
time
around
that
all
of
the
spending
plans
will
necessarily
be
executed
said
razia
khan
chief
africa
economist
at
standard
chartered
bank
she
added
that
the
plan
for
a
supplementary
budget
was
likely
to
be
because
of
some
degree
of
uncertainty
as
to
the
value
of
all
the
spending
projects
that
were
proposed
by
the
senate
and
approved
john
ashbourne
senior
emerging
markets
economist
at
capital
economics
said
next
year
s
vote
in
which
some
legislators
will
seek
election
may
have
led
to
the
insertion
of
some
projects
by
lawmakers
the
international
monetary
fund
in
february
said
nigerians
were
getting
poorer
despite
the
recovery
from
recession
inflation
has
fallen
for
straight
months
slowing
to
a
more
than
two
year
low
of
