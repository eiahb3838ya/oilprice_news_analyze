to
fill

political
conditions
sometimes
internal

sometimes
external
result
in
reduced

we

from

its

a
commitment
to
step
in
and
more
than
fill
the
gap
to
ensure
sustainable
prices
indian
oil
minister
dharmendra
pradhan
said
at
a
seminar
in
vienna
he
said
currently
high
oil
prices
dent
the
economic
development
of
many
countries
the
already
fragile
world
economic
growth
will
be
at
threat
if
oil
prices
persist
at
these
levels
my
fear
is
this
will
lead
to
energy
poverty
in
many
parts
of
the
world
he
said
new
delhi
which
imports
about
percent
of
its
crude
oil
needs
has
been
urging
responsible
oil
pricing
that
balances
the
interests
of
producers
and
consumers
and
supports
the
global
economy
pradhan
said
india
does
not
support
the
prevailing
high
price
these
prices
are
creating
stress
throughout
global
economy
as
it
is
giving
pain
to
us
in
india
he
said
india
s
trade
deficit
in
may
widened
to
billion
the
highest
in
four
months
driven
mainly
by
a
percent
surge
in
the
country
s
oil
import
bill
globally
crude
prices
have
gone
beyond
the
threshold
which
can
be
sustained
by
the
world
particularly
countries
like
india
which
is
a
key
driver
of
world
economy
he
said
india
s
footprint
in
global
energy
markets
will
increase
materially
from
to
making
it
the
largest
growth
market
for
global
energy
bp
plc
said
in
its
energy
outlook
report
in
february
pradhan
urged
opec
producers
to
maintain
supply
equilibrium
it
is
in
the
interests
of
producers
that
other
economies
keep
growing
steadily
and
rapidly
so
as
to
ensure
growing
energy
markets
for
themselves
this
is
the
key
to
energy
