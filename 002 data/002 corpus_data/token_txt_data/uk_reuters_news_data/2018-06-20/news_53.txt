china
s
stock
markets
slumped
on
wednesday
extending
a
rout
from
the
previous
day
as
the
prospect
of
a
trade
war
put
a
dampener
on
the
rest
of
asian
equities
even
as
they
managed
a
modest
bounce

recommended
the
move
in
working
paper
on
tuesday
it
is
fair
to
say
an
rrr
cut
seems
imminent
the
only
question
is
the

sue

head

at

capital
markets
in
hong
kong
said
in
a
note
an
apparent
bias
toward
looser
policy
runs
counter
to
the
regional
bias
toward
higher
rates
to
protect
currency
downside
she
said
adding
that
growing
policy
divergence
indicates
room
for
the
onshore

offshore
yuan
to
depreciate
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
china
showed
few
signs
of
easing
after
a
white

trade
adviser
said
on

that
beijing
has
underestimated
the
president

resolve
to
impose
more
tariffs
washington
threatened
on

to
impose
a

tariff
on

to
raise

on

australia
rally
in
contrast
australian
stocks
gained
percent
supported
by
a
weak
local
dollar
which
rose
percent
after
hitting
a
low
on
tuesday
a
more
attractive
dividend
proposition
and
a
weaker
australian
dollar
have
made
the
market
more
alluring
to
overseas
investors
said
ryan
felsman
a
senior
economist
at
commsec
last
year
the
aussie
market
was
only
up
percent
relative
to
the
us
at
percent
we
didn
t
get
the
sugar
hit
from
the
corporate

plan
so
there
s
a
bit
of
in
play
as
well
he
said
the
us
dollar
was
mostly
flat
against
the
yen
rising

to
still
some
distance

analysts
said
in
a
note
that
rising
trade
tensions
and
disagreement
within
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
which

on
friday
are
likely
to
weigh

that
opec
was
unlikely
to
reach
a

on
