serbia
s
president
called
on
western
balkan
countries
to
settle
their
differences
and
create
a
common
market
to
attract
badly
needed
foreign
investment
armed
conflict
in
the
balkans
ended
more
than
years
ago
but
five
of
the
states
that
emerged
after
the
former
yugoslavia
broke
up
bosnia
macedonia
montenegro
kosovo
and
serbia
still
have
border
disputes
to
settle
all
five
along
with
albania
hope
to
join
the
european
union
which
has
called
on
them
to
settle
their
disputes
before
they
join
but
little
progress
has
been
made
serbian
president
aleksandar
vucic
told
a
business
fair
in
the
bosnian
town
of
mostar
the
six
need
to
work
more
closely
to
create
a
better
investment
climate
split
into
small
states
and
even
smaller
markets
we
have
nothing
to
look
and
hope
for
our
only
chance
to
catch
up
with
the
rest
of
the
world
is
in
creating
a
much
bigger
market
in
the
future
vucic
said
he
said
economic
cooperation
could
also
help
build
stability
and
peace
in
the
region
where
persistent
ethnic
tensions
still
block
economic
progress
such
a
market
could
attract
more
investors
open
bigger
projects
create
jobs
and
fuel
growth
and
development
vucic
said
to
create
the
market
the
six
countries
need
to
lift
barriers
to
the
flow
of
goods
and
people
harmonise
taxes
and
abolish
fiscal
charges
vucic
said
such
measures
could
attract
up
to
billion
euros
in
investment
in
coming
years
more
than
triple
their
current
value
he
said
our
businessmen
need
it
more
than
our
politicians
vucic
said
operating
costs
for
companies
whose
trucks
wait
as
long
as
hours
more
than
necessary
to
cross
borders
have
increased
by
percent
but
to
create
a
common
market
belgrade
would
need
to
resolve
all
outstanding
issues
with
kosovo
among
others
little
progress
has
been
made
there
despite
eu
meditation
belgrade
still
refuses
to
recognise
kosovo
s
independence
the
idea
of
a
common
market
has
drawn
a
mixed
response
in
the
region
some
of
the
countries
fear
it
would
be
dominated
by
serbia
it
would
mean
a
lot
for
boosting
economic
ties
said
pane
skrbic
a
member
of
the
european
association
of
managers
the
businessmen
have
been
erasing
these
borders
much
more
easily
than
politicians
