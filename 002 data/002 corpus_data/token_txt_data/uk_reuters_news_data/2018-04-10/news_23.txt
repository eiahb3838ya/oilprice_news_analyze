future
russian
gas
transit
flows
through
ukraine
to
europe
may
be
between
and
billion
cubic
metres
per
year
alexei
miller
head
of
russian
gas
giant
gazprom
said
on
tuesday
which
is
a
significant
decline
from
current
levels
miller
issued
his
comments
after
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
that
the
planned
new
nord
stream
pipeline
between
russia
and
germany
could
not
go
ahead
without
clarity
on
ukraine
s
role
as
a
transit
route
for
gas
we
have
never
raised
an
issue
about
abandoning
the
ukrainian
transit
however
the
russian
resource
base
has
been
moving
northward
and
there
won
t
be
the
same
resources
in
the
central
gas
transportation
corridor
as
it
was
in
the
past
miller
said
in
a
statement
that
s
why
a
certain
transit
could
still
be
in
place
in
the
amount
of
bcm
per
year
but
the
ukrainian
side
has
to
explain
the
viability
of
the
new
transit
contract
he
said
he
did
not
give
a
time
frame
for
when
the
transit
could
be
bcm
a
year
ukraine
has
been
a
key
route
for
carrying
russian
gas
to
europe
where
it
supplies
around
a
third
of
gas
needs
but
moscow
and
kiev
have
clashed
frequently
over
energy
last
year
the
transit
amounted
to
more
than
bcm
while
gazprom
s
total
exports
to
europe
and
turkey
reached
an
high
of
bcm
last
year
ukraine
earned
around
billion
in
russian
gas
transit
fees
gazprom
said
last
month
it
would
terminate
its
gas
contracts
with
ukraine
after
it
lost
a
court
case
escalating
a
dispute
which
had
left
ukraine
struggling
to
stay
warm
and
which
the
european
union
said
could
threaten
gas
flows
to
europe
a
stockholm
arbitration
court
ordered
gazprom
in
february
to
pay
more
than
billion
to
ukrainian
energy
firm
naftogaz
a
ruling
meant
to
conclude
a
long
legal
battle
that
has
run
alongside
ukraine
s
broader
political
with
russia
gazprom
wants
to
bypass
ukraine
as
an
export
route
and
plans
to
build
two
more
undersea
gas
pipelines
to
europe
turkstream
to
turkey
and
nord
stream
to
germany
eastern
european
and
baltic
states
fear
nord
stream
planned
to
run
through
the
baltic
sea
could
increase
reliance
on
russian
gas
and
undermine
ukraine
s
role
as
a
gas
transit
route
the
plans
for
the
pipelines
were
given
new
impetus
after
relations
between
moscow
and
kiev
plunged
as
president
viktor
yanukovich
fled
ukraine
in
following
street
protests
and
a
revolt
subsequently
flared
in
eastern
ukraine
the
current
deal
between
russia
and
ukraine
on
gas
purchases
and
transit
expires
at
the
end
of
and
kiev
has
been
worrying
about
losing
its
transfer
fees
for
shipping
the
russian
gas
westwards
to
europe
