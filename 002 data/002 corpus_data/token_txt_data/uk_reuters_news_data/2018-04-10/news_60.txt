cryptocurrency miners seek cheap energy in norway and sweden
reuters
cryptocurrency
miners
are
moving
in
to
norway
and
sweden
to
take
advantage
of
cheap
energy
and
low
temperatures
to
power
and
cool
their
servers
iceland
has
been
europe
s
most
popular
location
for
miners
of
digital
currencies
such
as
bitcoin
and
ethereum
but
at
euro
cents
and
cents
per
kilowatt
hours
respectively
commercial
power
prices
in
sweden
and
norway
are
cheaper
than
iceland
s
cents
and
far
below
the
european
average
of
cents
the
interest
is
good
news
for
sweden
s
vattenfall
and
norway
s
statkraft
the
dominant
utilities
in
their
countries
supplying
power
to
cryptocurrency
miners
is
a
tiny
part
of
current
business
but
the
two
firms
have
said
they
see
it
as
an
opportunity
the
process
is
energy
intensive
miners
plug
in
thousands
of
servers
at
a
time
to
get
the
computing
power
to
produce
cryptocurrencies
which
is
done
by
solving
mathematical
equations
miners
of
bitcoin
will
use
about
terawatt
hours
of
energy
this
year
matching
argentina
s
consumption
or
the
projected
usage
of
all
the
world
s
electric
vehicles
by
the
according
to
morgan
stanley
we
re
on
a
global
hunt
to
secure
as
much
power
as
we
can
said
olivier
roussy
newton
director
and
of
canadian
group
hive
blockchain
technologies
which
started
mining
ethereum
in
sweden
in
january
the
company
said
it
was
expanding
energy
capacity
for
its
crypto
mining
in
sweden
to
megawatts
with
funds
available
to
ramp
up
a
further
mw
by
september
last
month
it
agreed
to
buy
data
centre
company
kolos
norway
as
for
million
million
pounds
with
a
view
to
expanding
its
mining
operations
in
march
miner
bitfury
opened
a
new
million
mining
data
centre
in
norway
the
miner
will
be
buying
gigawatt
hours
of
pure
clean
energy
from
local
renewable
energy
provider
helgeland
kraft
many
bitcoin
miners
are
looking
at
the
area
including
the
chinese
because
of
abundant
cheap
hydro
power
said
bill
tai
a
member
of
bitfury
s
board
of
directors
china
s
bitmain
the
world
s
largest
bitcoin
miner
which
recently
set
up
a
unit
in
switzerland
has
also
been
investigating
sweden
and
norway
s
potential
two
industry
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
china
accounts
for
around
percent
of
the
crytopcurrency
mining
industry
but
beijing
has
discouraged
it
in
part
due
to
concerns
about
pollution
from
power
this
has
forced
them
to
look
elsewhere
a
lot
of
miners
are
keen
to
get
into
norway
and
that
includes
bitmain
and
other
chinese
names
said
mark
collins
chief
executive
of
cbh
consulting
ag
a
clean
energy
consultant
running
for
the
blockchain
industry
a
second
source
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
also
mentioned
bitmain
s
interest
a
number
of
nationalities
are
turning
to
the
nordics
that
source
said
bitmain
spokesman
nishant
sharma
said
the
company
would
announce
expansions
in
europe
and
other
regions
as
they
occur
he
said
he
was
not
aware
of
any
special
plans
for
sweden
or
norway
mining
a
single
bitcoin
requires
worth
of
electricity
up
to
a
quarter
of
the
total
costs
and
about
the
annual
power
bill
of
a
household
in
germany
this
means
that
cryptocurrency
miners
are
under
pressure
from
policymakers
to
prove
their
green
credentials
and
norway
and
sweden
s
clean
energy
holds
even
greater
appeal
this
area
is
the
saudi
arabia
of
green
energy
said
tai
in
norway
hydropower
accounts
for
over
percent
of
electricity
production
while
in
sweden
the
number
is
about
percent
with
the
same
again
from
nuclear
some
utilities
in
europe
such
as
italy
s
enel
and
germany
s
are
worried
that
the
speculation
behind
cryptocurrencies
could
lead
to
a
market
crash
enel
said
in
february
it
was
not
interested
in
powering
cryptocurrency
miners
but
norway
and
sweden
have
welcomed
the
business
it
is
an
opportunity
for
energy
providers
in
the
area
it
s
a
consistent
power
draw
for
them
without
spikes
and
troughs
and
energy
providers
like
that
said
collins
norway
recently
changed
tax
rules
to
exempt
data
centres
from
paying
property
taxes
in
a
bid
to
attract
foreign

there

said
vattenfall
provides
canaan
with
the
roughly
mw
of
power
capacity
it
needs
and
the
utility
sees
more
bitcoin
deals
on
the
horizon
there
are
a
number
of
companies
in
different
phases
of
evaluating
establishment
on
the
nordic
market
said
matts
wesslen
vattenfall
s
manager
of
energy
intensive
industries
nevertheless
alex
de
vries
blockchain
specialist
at
pwc
said
the
opportunities
in
cryptocurrency
mining
may
be
if
bitcoin
energy
consumption
continues
like
it
does
today
it
will
become
unsustainable
he
said
that
might
be
an
opportunity
for
utilities
in
the
but
over
the
miners
will
have
to
find
ways
to
become
more
efficient
to
cut
