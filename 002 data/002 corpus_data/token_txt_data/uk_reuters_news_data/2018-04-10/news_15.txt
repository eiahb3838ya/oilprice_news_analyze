streible
analyst
at
rjo
futures
in
chicago
oil
markets
are
getting
a
bounce
on
increasing
speculation
about
trump
and
syria
streible
said
president
donald
trump
promised
a
swift
response
to
a
suspected
chemical
attack
in
syria
such
a
response
is
likely
to
increase
the
push
for
the
united
states
to
exit
the
iran
nuclear
deal
streible
said
given
iran
s
support
of
the
syrian
government
departures
from
the
accord
would
result
in
renewed
sanctions
against
iran
which
would
hurt
its
oil
industry
also
supportive
to
crude
prices
was
the
weakness
of
the
dollar
the
dollar
fell
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
hitting
its
lowest
in
nearly
two
weeks
because
oil
is
a
stronger
greenback
makes
purchases
in
other
currencies
more
expensive
the
american
petroleum
institute
will
publish
its
storage
data

anticipated
a

said
it

oil
production

rise
by

bpd
to

year
more
