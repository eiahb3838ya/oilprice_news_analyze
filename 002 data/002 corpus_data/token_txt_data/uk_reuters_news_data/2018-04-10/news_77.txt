new

reuters
california
s
top
clean
air
regulator
told
reuters
on
monday
the
state
is
willing
to
give
automakers
more
flexibility
to
comply
with
vehicle
emissions
rules
even
as
her
agency
prepares
to
fight
the
trump
administration
over
car
and
truck
pollution
standards
mary
nichols
who
chairs
the
california
air
resources
board
said
in
an
interview
she
thinks
the
trump
administration
california
and
automakers
can
reach
agreement
to
revise
and
extend
the
standards
we
think
there
s
a
way
you
could
give
some
recognition
to
the
concerns
of
the
auto
companies
have
raised
that
would
not
do
fundamental
damage
to
those
standards
nichols
said
suggesting
the
state
could
endorse
new
credits
and
flexibilities
or
she
said
the
state
s
precondition
for
discussing
changing
the
rules
is
that
you
also
need
to
talk
to
us
about
the
next
set
of
rules
extending
to
at
least
last
week
scott
pruitt
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
said
the
standards
on
model
year
to
vehicles
were
not
appropriate
and
should
be
revised
reversing
a
decision
by
the
obama
administration
in
january
that
had
sought
to
lock
in
the
rules
nichols
said
california
and
other
states
are
actively
examining
a
lawsuit
challenging
pruitt
s
decision
on
the
appropriateness
of
the
rules
before
the
administration
proposes
specific
changes
to
the
requirements
a
legal
filing
seeking
to
preserve
states
rights
is
under
consideration
but
does
not
mean
they
could
not
still
try
to
reach
agreement
with
automakers
and
the
federal
government
we
can
sue
and
talk
at
the
same
time
nichols
said
the
obama
standards
agreed
to
by
california
and
major
automakers
called
for
roughly
doubling
by
the
average
fuel
efficiency
of
new
vehicles
sold
in
the
united
states
to
about
miles
km
per
gallon
by
proponents
said
they
could
help
spur
innovation
in
clean
technologies
auto
industry
executives
asked
the
trump
administration
to
revise
the
obama
standards
to
make
it
less
costly
to
meet
complex
emissions
and
fuel
economy
targets
which
vary
depending
on
the
size
of
vehicles
and
whether
they
are
classified
as
cars
or
trucks
nichols
said
federal
and
state
governments
and
automakers
should
work
on
setting
rules
through
and
suggested
california
is
open
to
a
significant
overhaul
of
the
way
the
emissions
rules
work
she
rejected
the
idea
that
there
is
a
crisis
facing
automakers
in
meeting
existing
emissions
rules
she
said
current
federal
corporate
average
fuel
economy
standards
do
not
effectively
incentivize
electric
vehicles
or
other
advanced
vehicles
those
standards
commonly
known
as
cafe
were
set
in
in
response
to
the
arab
oil
embargos
nichols
said
the
state
could
agree
to
new
credits
to
account
for
zero
emission
ride
sharing
vehicles
or
revise
earlier
rules
that
held
automakers
accountable
for
upstream
emissions
from
the
generation
of
power
for
electric
vehicles
california
has
long
been
allowed
by
an
epa
waiver
to
impose
stricter
standards
than
washington
does
on
vehicle
emissions
of
some
pollutants
but
the
state
agreed
to
adopt
the
obama
emissions
rules
in
and
other
states
including
new
york
pennsylvania
and
massachusetts
follow
california
s
lead
on
cleaner
cars
the
trump
administration
has
not
shared
any
data
with
california
yet
and
there
have
been
no
substantial
talks
with
the
state
and
federal
regulators
nichols
said
a
primary
concern
among
automakers
is
to
avoid
overlapping
conflicting
regulatory
standards
the
national
highway
traffic
safety
administration
sets
corporate
average
fuel
economy
or
cafe
requirements
that
are
not
identical
to
the
epa
limits
on
vehicle
carbon
dioxide
emissions
automakers
agree
and
we
do
too
that
the
cafe
standards
have
somewhat
outlived
their
usefulness
nichols
said
auto
regulations
should
be
focused
on
overall
vehicle
emissions
as
the
driving
factor
