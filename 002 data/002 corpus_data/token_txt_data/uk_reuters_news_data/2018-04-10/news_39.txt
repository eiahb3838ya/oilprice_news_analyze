the
views
expressed
are
his
own
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
china
are
likely
to
have
an
adverse
impact
on
global
growth
even
if
the
threatened
tariffs
are
never
imposed
conflict
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
is
creating
significant
uncertainty
for
businesses
that
threatens
their
global
supply
chains
and
future
investment
plans
senior
officials
have
emphasized
the
tariffs
are
only
a
proposal
at
this
stage
and
could
be
averted
by
a
settlement
between
the
two
countries
but
the
disjunction
between
hardline
rhetoric
and
aggressive
tariff
proposals
on
the
one
hand
and
reassurance
to
investors
and
businesses
on
the
other
has
whipsawed
the
financial
markets
equity
indices
and
commodity
prices
have
alternated
between
selloffs
and
rallies
as
traders
try
to
estimate
the
probability
tariffs
will
be
imposed
in
reality
the
direct
economic
damage
done
by
tariffs
would
be
fairly
small
though
the
impact
on
some
firms
and
sectors
would
be
more
concentrated
bilateral
trade
of
around
billion
between
the
two
countries
represents
only
a
small
percentage
of
the
gross
domestic
production
of
the
united
states
trillion
and
china
trillion
but
the
threat
of
tariffs
will
have
a
much
more
damaging
and
chilling
impact
on
investment
decisions
that
depend
on
global
supply
chains
even
if
the
import
taxes
are
never
actually
imposed
for
multinational
businesses
considering
the
location
of
new
manufacturing
facility
the
threat
of
tariffs
is
likely
to
cause
at
least
an
additional
pause
before
the
project
is
given
the
if
decisions
are
delayed
the
result
will
be
a
slowdown
in
investment
at
least
in
the
short
term
with
negative
implications
for
growth
officials
have
indicated
it
could
take
six
months
or
more
to
reach
a
final
decision
on
tariffs
which
implies
an
extended
period
of
damaging
uncertainty
the
damage
will
extend
well
beyond
decisions
on
the
location
of
new
automotive
plants
and
semiconductor
factories
most
major
construction
projects
and
manufacturing
systems
depend
on
raw
materials
and
components
that
cross
international
borders
at
least
once
and
in
some
cases
multiple
times
raw
materials
components
and
finished
goods
generally
have
to
be
ordered
many
months
or
even
years
in
advance
projected
costs
depend
on
estimates
of
the
price
of
items
ordered
now
but
which
may
not
arrive
and
clear
customs
until
many
months
in
the
future
when
they
could
be
liable
to
new
tariffs
every
business
relying
on
items
from
one
of
the
countries
engaged
in
a
potential
trade
war
must
calculate
the
risk
the
items
will
be
unavailable
or
significantly
more
expensive
and
make
contingency
plans
accordingly
even
if
a
truce
is
declared
in
the
current
trade
spat
it
has
raised
major
questions
about
the
future
direction
of
trade
and
investment
policies
since
the
broad
thrust
of
international
economic
policies
has
been
towards
greater
openness
to
trade
and
investment
led
by
the
united
states
successive
rounds
of
trade
negotiations
have
lowered
average
tariff
barriers
and
tried
to
control
barriers
on
trade
and
investment
to
create
a
more
predictable
environment
for
business
officials
conducted
eight
successful
rounds
of
multinational
trade
negotiations
between
and
under
the
general
agreement
on
tariffs
and
trade
in
addition
there
have
been
several
ambitious
attempts
to
liberalize
regional
trade
notably
the
european
union
and
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
as
well
as
a
dense
network
of
bilateral
free
trade
agreements
protectionism
has
never
been
far
from
the
surface
but
the
broad
trend
has
been
in
the
direction
of
greater
liberalization
the
liberalization
thrust
has
seemed
to
run
out
of
momentum
in
recent
years
with
the
failure
to
conclude
a
new
round
of
global
trade
negotiations
the
tariff
war
now
threatens
to
send
the
process
into
reverse
proponents
of
tariffs
have
made
explicitly
clear
they
want
to
revive
manufacturing
by
cutting
global
supply
chains
and
them
this
marks
a
major
change
in
the
direction
of
the
international
economic
system
and
could
upend
corporate
strategies
that
have
been
based
on
global
supply
chain
management
the
results
could
leave
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
of
foreign
investments
as
stranded
assets
if
multinationals
are
forced
to
reconfigure
their
supply
networks
the
potential
for
asset
stranding
and
helps
explain
why
stock
markets
have
reacted
so
badly
to
the
threat
of
tariffs
even
when
their
direct
economic
impact
would
be
limited
the
threat
of
a
trade
war
has
injected
an
extra
degree
of
uncertainty
that
will
not
necessarily
be
lifted
even
if
the
two
sides
reach
a
settlement
it
comes
at
a
time
when
britain
is
withdrawing
from
the
european
union
and
international
sanctions
are
also
proliferating
and
disrupting
the
operation
of
supply
chains
for
energy
and
minerals
and
there
is
no
guarantee
another
tariff
war
will
not
break
out
in
future
over
another
issue
corporate
leaders
must
plan
for
a
world
in
which
greater
openness
to
trade
and
investment
is
no
longer
a
given
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
china
have
revealed
the
shallowness
of
political
support
for
the
current
open
trading
system
let
alone
further
liberalization
whatever
the
merits
of
the
current
dispute
the
threat
of
tariffs
has
injected
a
significant
additional
source
of
uncertainty
into
the
global
economy
that
is
likely
to
inhibit
investment
and
output
growth
the
tariff
war
is
a
sign
the
project
of
trade
liberalization
is
in
deep
trouble
and
the
impact
could
linger
even
if
the
united
states
and
china
can
negotiate
a
truce
