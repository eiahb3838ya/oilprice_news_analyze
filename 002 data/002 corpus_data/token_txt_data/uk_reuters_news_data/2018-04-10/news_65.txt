an
influential
japanese
energy
panel
on
tuesday
left
the
door
open
to
building
nuclear
plants
to
help
meet
emissions
targets
urging
rapid
technology
improvements
to
allow
industry
to
develop
safer
and
more
economic
reactors
the
advisory
panel
whose
recommendations
will
feed
into
a
review
of
the
country
s
basic
energy
plan
and
its
measures
to
cut
carbon
emissions
by
said
japan
should
reduce
its
dependence
on
nuclear
power
shift
from
coal
to
gas
and
boost
renewable
energy
however
it
listed
nuclear
power
as
an
option
for
decarbonization
in
implying
the
possibility
of
new
reactors
which
is
not
part
of
the
current
policy
of
the
ministry
of
economy
trade
and
industry
the
report
does
not
specifically
talk
about
possible
building
of
new
reactors
or
replacing
existing
reactors
but
it
does
not
deny
such
a
possibility
either
shogo
tanaka
director
of
the

s
energy
strategy
office
told

nuclear
faces
strong
public
opposition
in

the
deadly
fukushima

with
just
five
of
the

s
commercially
viable
reactors
currently
operating
the
closures
have

did
not
give
a

mix
for

years
it
called
for
a
further
boost
in

to
make
the
