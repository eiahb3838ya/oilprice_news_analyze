rare appearance fuels speculation algeria's bouteflika will run again
algiers
reuters
a
rare
public
appearance
by
veteran
algerian
president
abdelaziz
bouteflika
is
fuelling
speculation
he
will
run
for
a
fifth
term
next
year
a
move
that
would
mean
at
least
stability
for
a
key
ally
and
one
of
europe
s
main
gas
suppliers
bouteflika
has
largely
disappeared
from
public
view
since
a
stroke
in
so
his
appearance
on
monday
to
open
a
restored
mosque
and
two
metro
stations
is
seen
as
a
sign
the
country
s
ruling
elite
want
him
to
stay
on
to
avoid
an
unclear
succession
in
power
since
the
visibly
frail
saluted
a
crowd
outside
the
ketchaoua
mosque
in
the
capital
algiers
waving
national
flags
and
holding
placards
with
photos
of
the
president
bouteflika
s
appearance
also
came
two
days
after
the
ruling
national
liberation
front
fln
called
on
him
to
run
again
and
as
state
media
sought
to
dispel
doubts
about
his
health
by
showcasing
his
past
meetings
with
foreign
dignitaries
while
another
term
for
bouteflika
would
give
a
ruling
caste
of
fln
officials
generals
and
business
tycoons
time
to
organise
a
smooth
succession
it
is
likely
to
be
a
source
of
frustration
for
young
algerians
worried
about
unemployment
and
austerity
in
a
economy
suffering
from
low
oil
prices
i
do
not
care
about
politics
and
politicians
bouteflika
running
for
a
fifth
term
a
sixth
term
or
not
not
my
problem
said
amin
ferrah
a
student
who
works
in
a
pizzeria
politics
is
not
my
in
a
country
where
about
half
the
population
is
under
many
young
algerians
are
looking
abroad
ferrah
wants
to
go
to
canada
while
others
have
taken
the
perilous
sea
crossing
to
europe
the
government
has
said
it
wants
to
diversify
the
economy
away
from
oil
and
gas
which
accounts
for
percent
of
budget
finances
but
there
has
been
resistance
from
those
within
the
ruling
elite
to
opening
up
to
foreign
investment
the
key
decision
makers
in
algeria
are
veterans
who
fought
from
against
french
occupation
and
fiercely
oppose
what
they
call
foreign
interference
that
has
left
the
economy
dominated
by
the
state
and
firms
run
by
business
tycoons
opponents
say
algeria
needs
a
national
dialogue
to
overcome
what
they
call
the
gravity
of
the
situation
a
veiled
call
on
the
country
s
power
brokers
to
assess
bouteflika
s
health
our
country
has
never
been
in
such
a
delicate
situation
carrying
such
a
great
risk
of
breaking
civil
peace
stability
and
national
security
as
it
is
now
ali
benflis
a
leading
opposition
figure
who
ran
against
bouteflika
in
and
told
reporters
a
month
ago
benflis
was
referring
to
strikes
by
teachers
and
doctors
that
have
been
running
for
months
because
the
government
has
been
unable
to
offer
them
more
cash
as
it
has
done
in
the
past
because
the
fall
in
oil
prices
has
stretched
public
finances
energy
revenues
have
halved
since
and
the
government
has
launched
austerity
measures
banning
the
import
of
goods
and
freezing
public
sector
hiring
and
development
projects
bouteflika
has
not
said
he
wants
to
run
again
but
previous
presidential
campaigns
have
followed
similar
statements
from
the
fln
calling
on
him
to
continue
bouteflika
s
supporters
say
his
mind
remains
sharp
even
though
he
needs
a
microphone
to
speak
the
president
enjoys
all
his
mental
and
intellectual
abilities
lakhdar
brahimi
a
retired
diplomat
and
close
friend
said
in
a
recent
interview
with
local
media
his
memory
is
very
strong
and
it
s
him
sometimes
who
reminds
me
of
dates
and
people
he
said
except
for
his
dead
voice
he
is
in
good
shape
and
he
rules
the
bouteflika
is
part
of
a
thinning
elite
of
the
veterans
who
fought
france
in
the
independence
war
and
have
run
algeria
ever
since
many
also
credit
him
with
ending
a
civil
war
with
islamists
in
the
that
killed
people
he
is
unlikely
to
face
competition
from
within
ruling
circles
prime
minister
ahmed
ouyahia
leader
of
the
national
rally
for
democracy
rnd
allied
to
the
fln
has
already
said
he
will
not
run
if
bouteflika
goes
for
a
fifth
term
analysts
say
the
opposition
fractured
between
moderate
islamists
and
groups
is
also
unlikely
to
mount
a
serious
challenge
in
presidential
elections
expected
in
the
first
half
of
no
date
has
been
set
yet
in
addition
thousands
of
former
islamist
fighters
who
accepted
a
partial
amnesty
to
end
the
civil
war
could
be
potential
bouteflika
supporters
if
he
runs
again
while
the
fighters
did
not
get
any
political
rights
under
the
original
deal
bouteflika
is
now
expected
to
offer
them
full
rights
nobody
has
yet
said
they
will
run
against
bouteflika
even
though
the
president
has
said
he
wants
more
competition
he
won
with
percent
of
the
vote
in
percent
in
percent
in
and
percent
in
the
political
scene
must
experience
diversity
a
confrontation
of
programmes
and
a
race
to
power

month
