update 1-national grid sees low uk electricity demand this summer
london
reuters
britain
s
national
grid
said
on
tuesday
it
expects
low
demand
for
electricity
this
summer
as
renewables
output
increases
and
warned
there
could
be
times
when
there
is
more
generation
than
needed
in
its
summer
outlook
report
national
grid
said
peak
transmission
system
demand
for
high
summer
was
forecast
at
gigawatts
gw
and
the
summer
minimum
at
gw
the
increase
in
distribution
connected
generation
for
example
wind
and
solar
photovoltaic
has
contributed
to
this
downward
trend
in
demand
the
grid
operator
said
in
the
report
summer
electricity
demand
from
the
grid
has
been
falling
over
the
past
few
years
due
in
part
to
a
rapid
increase
in
the
amount
of
solar
power
generation
on
people
s
homes
and
factory
roofs
however
increased
renewables
output
can
create
challenges
as
solar
and
wind
output
is
variable
as
a
result
we
may
need
to
take
more
actions
to
curtail
generation
and
possibly
instruct
inflexible
generators
to
reduce
their
output
in
order
to
balance
the
system
the
report
added
lower
overall
electricity
demand
along
with
increased
renewables
generation
means
there
is
less
need
for
electricity
generation
total
uk
gas
demand
for
this
summer
is
forecast
at
billion
cubic
meters
slightly
lower
than
last
summer
national
grid
said
it
expects
to
see
similar
gas
supply
and
demand
patterns
to
last
summer
with
demand
only
around
percent
lower
than
the
winter
peak
however
national
grid
said
its
expects
one
of
the
highest
volumes
of
maintenance
on
the
gas
transmission
system
to
date
this
summer
the
grid
operator
also
forecasts
that
there
will
be
bcm
of
gas
demand
for
storage
sites
compared
to
demand
of
bcm
last
summer
the
amount
of
gas
which
will
be
injected
into
gas
storage
sites
this
summer
will
depend
on
the
level
of
stock
at
the
end
of
winter
gas
is
traditionally
stored
during
the
summer
months
to
be
used
during
winter
when
demand
and
prices
are
higher
however
the
closure
of
britain
s
largest
gas
storage
site
rough
means
less
gas
can
be
stored
last
year
the
most
significant
injection
into
storage
was
when
the
interconnectoruk
pipeline
to
continental
europe
closed
for
annual
maintenance
during
the
summer
national
grid
expects
a
similar
trend
this
summer
