paris
reuters
france
s
president
emmanuel
macron
took
on
critics
of
saudi
arabia
s
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
on
tuesday
saying
it
was
too
easy
to
criticise
the
young
leader
s
haste
to
reform
and
urged
detractors
to
give
him
time
prince
mohammed
who
was
ending
a
tour
to
france
on
tuesday
has
won
western
plaudits
for
seeking
to
reduce
saudi
arabia
s
reliance
on
oil
tackle
chronic
corruption
and
transform
the
deeply
conservative
mainly
sunni
muslim
kingdom
but
the
severity
and
secrecy
of
an
crackdown
last
november
after
the
prince
ousted
an
older
cousin
as
crown
prince
in
a
palace
coup
last
june
has
unnerved
some
investors
human
rights
groups
also
question
how
far
the
kingdom
has
come
after
a
tense
first
exchange
between
the
two
leaders
in
riyadh
last
november
that
was
dominated
by
a
difference
of
opinion
on
how
to
handle
riyadh
s
regional
rival
iran
macron
and
prince
mohammed
sought
to
get
to
know
each
other
and
work
on
what
they
have
in
common
rather
than
their
differences
i
hear
legitimate
questions
from
civil
society
journalists
about
human
rights
and
various
sensitive
issues
concerning
your
country
but
i
m
also
looking
at
what
s
going
on
in
the
region
we
have
here
a
young
leader
who
is
going
to
be
in
the
highest
functions
in
a
country
where
percent
of
the
population
is
under
macron
said
alongside
the
prince
we
can
have
the
choice
to
stick
to
our
traditional
positions
and
we
can
decide
that
the
first
acts
of
modernization
of
his
society
are
cosmetic
if
we
do
that
then
we
are
leaving
prince
mohammed
to
face
those
in
his
area
that
think
the
opposite
and
decide
to
go
backwards
and
keep
to
a
political
islam
or
terrorism
he
said
under
the
reforms
closely
associated
with
the
crown
prince
social
restrictions
have
been
loosened
such
as
bans
on
cinemas
and
women
driving
he
has
promised
to
promote
a
more
moderate
form
of
islam
during
his
visit
to
paris
he
met
interfaith
leaders
and
pushed
for
a
new
strategic
partnership
that
in
essence
focused
heavily
on
france
s
cultural
soft
power
and
tourism
rather
than
signing
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
lucrative
contracts
as
he
had
done
in
the
united
states
and
britain
you
and
i
are
old
in
saudi
arabia
because
percent
of
the
population
is
younger
than
us
prince
mohammed
joked
during
the
news
conference
at
the
elysee
palace
macron
is
only
eight
years
older
than
the
prince
the
partnership
between
saudi
arabia
and
france
is
very
important
especially
now
that
europe
and
the
middle
east
are
going
through
changes
in
the
the
two
leaders
also
had
some
tense
moments
in
november
after
lebanese
officials
accused
saudi
arabia
of
holding
prime
minister
saad
hariri
hostage
in
the
kingdom
macron
eventually
mediated
a
solution
with
prince
mohammed
to
the
problem
and
on
tuesday
the
three
dined
at
the
elysee
palace
with
hariri
tweeting
a
selfie
of
the
three
of
them
while
macron
made
no
specific
references
to
human
rights
or
freedoms
in
the
kingdom
he
had
perhaps
opted
to
push
a
more
subtle
message
two
days
earlier
in
a
private
dinner
and
tour
of
the
louvre
museum
including
an
exhibition
of
revolutionary
french
painter
eugene
delacroix
a
picture
on
macron
s
twitter
feed
showed
the
two
men
contemplating
delacroix
most
famous
painting
liberty
leading
the
people
a
woman
standing
over
revolutionary
barricades
holding
a
french
tricolour
flag
if
there
is
one
chance
that
his
project
succeeds
then
it
s
the
responsibility
of
france
to
accompany
him
