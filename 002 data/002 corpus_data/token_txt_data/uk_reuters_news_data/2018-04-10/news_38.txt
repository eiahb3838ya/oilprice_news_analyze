a
span
of
minutes
fighter
jets
took
off
and
landed
on
the
uss
theodore
roosevelt
aircraft
carrier
in
a
powerful
display
of
military
precision
and
efficiency
the
warship
leading
a
carrier
strike
group
was
conducting
what
the
military
called
routine
training
in
the
disputed
south
china
sea
on
tuesday
headed
for
a
port
call
in
the
philippines
a
defence
treaty
ally
the
united
states
is
not
alone
in
carrying
out
naval
patrols
in
the
strategic
waterway
where
chinese
japanese
and
some
southeast
asian
navies
operate
possibly
increasing
tensions
and
risking
accidents
at
sea
we
have
seen
chinese
ships
around
us
rear
admiral
steve
koehler
the
strike
group
commander
told
a
small
group
of
reporters
on
board
the
carrier
they
are
one
of
the
navies
that
operate
in
the
south
china
sea
but
i
would
tell
you
that
we
have
seen
nothing
but
professional
work
out
of
the
ships
we
have
navies
in
the
western
pacific
including
china
and
nine
southeast
asian
countries
have
been
working
on
a
code
of
unexpected
encounters
cues
at
sea
to
avoid
conflict
the
uss
theodore
roosevelt
s
presence
in
the
south
china
sea
comes
days
after
china
s
massive
air
and
naval
drills
in
the
area
in
what
some
analysts
described
as
an
unusually
large
display
of
beijing
s
growing
naval
might
china
s
growing
military
presence
in
the
waters
has
fuelled
concern
in
the
west
about
beijing
s
end
game
the
united
states
has
criticised
china
s
apparent
militarisation
of
manmade
islands
and
carried
out
regular
air
and
naval
patrols
to
assert
its
right
to
freedom
of
navigation
in
stretches
of
a
sea
china
claims
largely
as
its
own
this
transit
in
the
south
china
sea
is
nothing
new
in
our
planning
cycle
or
in
a
reaction
to
that
it
is
probably
by
happenstance
that
all
that
is
happening
at
the
same
time
said
koehler
who
gave
a
tour
of
the
carrier
to
philippine
military
officials
and
watched
flight
operations
aboard
the
warship
all
of
the
operations
that
we
do
in
and
around
the
south
china
sea
or
any
of
the
bodies
of
water
we
operate
in
there
is
a
function
of
international
law
and
that
is
ultimately
what
we
want
to
recognise
koehler
said
tension
between
the
united
states
and
china
over
trade
and
territory
under
president
donald
trump
has
been
stepped
up
of
late
with
fear
in
the
region
that
the
south
china
sea
vital
to
global
trade
could
one
day
become
a
battleground
between
the
two
rival
powers
philippine
ties
with
china
have
meanwhile
warmed
under
president
rodrigo
duterte
who
has
put
aside
disputes
with
beijing
and
wants
it
to
play
a
key
role
in
building
and
funding
urgently
needed
infrastructure
from
highways
and
ports
to
railways
and
power
plants
china
has
long
objected
to
military
operations
off
its
coasts
even
in
areas
washington
insists
are
free
to
international
passage
they
china
certainly
have
the
right
to
exercise
off
their
coast
like
we
do
nor
are
they
necessarily
in
charge
of
our
transit
cycle
but
our
deployment
s
been
planned
koehler
said
as
the
crew
in
uniforms
raced
to
service
dozens
of
aircraft
taking
off
and
landing
handlers
in
the
flight
deck
control
made
sure
the
deck
had
enough
room
for
jets
to
manoeuvre
and
refuel
with
the
help
of
a
ouija
board
the
board
has
all
the
models
of
each
aircraft
which
are
marked
with
squadron
name
model
make
and
number
of
personnel
at
any
given
moment
the
flight
deck
is
home
to
dozens
of
aircraft
and
helicopters
it
is
a
showcase
of
the
capability
of
the
armed
forces
philippine
army
chief
rolando
bautista
said
of
the
demonstration
since
americans
are
our
friends
in
one
way
or
another
they
can
help
us
