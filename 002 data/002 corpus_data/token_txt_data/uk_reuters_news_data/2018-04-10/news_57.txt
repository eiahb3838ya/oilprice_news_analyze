china
s
major
utilities
are
preparing
to
launch
their
own
coal
price
index
for
imports
an
official
at
china
huaneng
group
said
in
a
move
the
power
firms
hope
will
give
them
more
control
over
how
much
they
pay
for
their
key
raw
material
huaneng
is
working
on
the
plan
with
china
datang
corp
guangdong
yuedean
group
and
zhejiang
energy
said
xu
zanfei
director
of
planning
for
huaneng
s
fuel
department
in
a
presentation
at
the
coaltrans
china
conference
the
plan
for
an
index
also
has
the
backing
of
smaller
power
companies
he
said
even
as
china
s
government
tries
to
cut
the
use
of
dirty
fuels
coal
still
accounts
for
a
majority
of
the
country
s
power
utilities
have
complained
over
the
past
two
years
that
a
prolonged
rally
in
prices
to
record
highs
due
to
tighter
supplies
of
the
fuel
and
strong
demand
has
hurt
profits
the
plan
also
comes
as
utility
executives
say
they
are
increasingly
worried
the
government
will
expand
efforts
to
curb
imports
potentially
fueling
another
rally
and
cutting
their
access
to
raw
materials
imports
are
expected
to
fall
percent
this
year
the
new
index
which
xu
said
will
be
launched
soon
will
cover
percent
of
china
s
total
coal
intake
and
will
offer
prices
for
southern
and
eastern
imports
the
utilities
hope
the
huge
volumes
involved
in
supplying
major
chinese
power
producers
will
induce
coal
suppliers
to
use
the
index
in
their
contracts
we
hope
china
can
have
some
consistency
in
its
import
policy
imported
coal
is
crucial
for
power
plants
in
the
coastal
areas
especially
in
the
summer
when
rail
freight
capacity
is
tight
xu
said
speaking
on
the
conference
sidelines
after
his
presentation
xu
said
the
index
will
mainly
reflect
prices
for
material
from
austrialia
and
indonesia
which
together
accounted
for
almost
of
china
s
coal
imports
last
year
zhao
jianguo
the
vice
chairman
of
china
s
coal
transportation
association
said
the
index
has
a
decent
chance
of
being
used
as
an
industry
benchmark
because
it
has
backing
from
major
utilities
this
index
is
likely
to
be
influential
because
it
will
reflect
prices
purchased
by
power
plants
he
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
conference
this
would
be
china
s
first
price
index
for
coal
imports
the
price
index
bspi
is
a
widely
used
spot
price
benchmark
for
domestic
trade
companies
have
different
schemes
for
pricing
their
imports
but
traders
said
having
a
coal
price
index
may
help
make
the
market
more
transparent
