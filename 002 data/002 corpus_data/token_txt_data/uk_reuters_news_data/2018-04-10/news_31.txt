researchers
have
unveiled
what
they
billed
as
the
world
s
first
house
to
serve
as
a
home
in
the
french
city
of
nantes
with
the
first
tenants
due
to
move
in
by
june
academics
at
the
university
of
nantes
who
led
the
project
said
it
was
the
first
house
built
in
situ
for
human
habitation
using
a
robot
the
robot
known
as
uses
a
special
polymer
material
that
should
keep
the
building
insulated
effectively
for
a
century
it
took
around
days
to
complete
its
part
of
the
work
on
the
house
creating
hollow
walls
that
were
subsequently
filled
with
concrete
for
insulation
is
this
the
future
it
s
a
solution
and
a
constructive
principle
that
is
interesting
because
we
create
the
house
directly
on
site
and
in
addition
thanks
to
the
robot
we
are
able
to
create
walls
with
complex
shapes

a
professor
who
worked
on
the
project
the
square
metre
square
feet
house
will
be
allocated
to
a
local
family
which
qualifies
for
social
housing
authorities
said
the
home
is
equipped
with
multiple
sensors
that
monitor
air
quality
humidity
and
temperature
as
well
as
equipment
to
evaluate
and
analyse
the
thermal
properties
of
the
building
researchers
believe
this
technology
will
enable
tenants
to
save
on
energy
costs
authorities
in
nantes
are
planning
further
building
projects
including
a
public
reception
building
and
a
housing
estate
