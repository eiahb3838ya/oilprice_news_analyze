hedge
funds
trimmed
their
bullish
position
in
crude
oil
and
fuels
in
the
most
recent
week
after
increasing
it
significantly
over
the
previous
fortnight
but
the
overall
reduction
conceals
a
sharp
shift
away
from
light
crude
wti
and
towards
the
international
marker
brent
according
to
an
analysis
of
position
data
published
by
regulators
and
exchanges
hedge
funds

other

while
trimming
their

by
just
million
barrels
the
fall
in
wti
net
length
was
the
largest
reduction
since
the
end
of
august
when
hurricanes
disrupted
the
refining
system
and
continues
a
trend
evident
in
recent
weeks
funds
have
been
steadily
cutting
their
exposure
to
wti
over
the
last
two
months
while
maintaining
a
strong
bullish
position
in
brent
the
net
long
position
in
wti
has
fallen
by
million
barrels
since
it
peaked
on
even
as
the
net
position
in
brent
has
risen
by
an
extra
million
barrels
over
the
same
period
the
result
is
that
the
position
in
brent
now
looks
exceptionally
stretched
while
positioning
in
wti
looks
far
less
lopsided
fund
managers
now
hold
almost
long
positions
in
brent
for
every
short

a

from
a

funds
hold
fewer
than
nine
long

in

for
every

from

the
shift
in
relative
positioning
between

the

spread
in

has
