of

targeting
the
country
s
tycoons
the
rouble
plunged
more
than
percent
against
the

to
its
lowest
since
speaking
at
the
boao
forum
for
asia
in
hainan
province
xi
vowed
to
open
china
s
economy
further
protect
intellectual
property
of
foreign
firms
and
he
criticised
a
cold
war
mentality
as
obsolete
in
his
first
public
comments
since
the
trade
dispute
with
president
donald
trump
s
administration
erupted
xi
s
comments
prompted
a
largely
positive
reaction
in
financial
markets
which
have
been
rattled
over
the
past
week
on
fears
the
tariffs
will
escalate
into
a
trade
war
that
would
threaten
global

markets
are
grabbing
at
the
slightest
hint
today
s
message
from
xi
contained
nothing
really
new
but
it
seemed
like
a
conciliatory
tone
and
so
the
market
is
just
grabbing
at
that
said
peter
garnry
head
of
equity
strategy
at
saxo
bank
in
copenhagen
it
goes
back
to
the
fact
that
there
is
still
uncertainty
on
trade
wars
and
even
if
we
get
a
slight
indication
that
it
won
t
be
the
worst
case
scenario
the
market
reacts
positively
he
said
while
predicting
ongoing
trade
tensions
throughout
oil
markets
rose
sharply
on
hopes
that
the
trade
dispute
may
be
resolved
without
greater
damage
to
the
global
economy
brent
crude
futures
climbed
more
percent
to
after
trading
flat
for
most
of
the
day
the
euro
surged
when
european
central
bank
policymaker
ewald
nowotny
told
reuters
that
the
central
bank
could
stagger
the
process
of
raising
euro
zone
interest
rates
by
first
lifting
its
deposit
rate
back
toward
positive
territory
the
euro
rose
percent
to
and
left
the
dollar
down
across
most
major
currencies
aside
from
the
japanese
yen
the
yen
which
traditionally
rises
in
times
of
market
stress
fell
versus
both
the
dollar
and
euro
the
dollar
rose
to
as
high
as
before
giving
up
some
of
those
gains
safe

bond
prices
including
treasuries
initially
dropped
as
risk
appetite
recovered
gold
rose
percent
the
australian
dollar
which
has
fallen
in
recent
weeks
because
of
the
economy
s
exposure
to
global
trade
flows
gained
against
the
dollar
as
did
asian
currencies
including
the
chinese
yuan
xi
explicitly
did
not
continue
the
trade
war
rhetoric
so
this
is
going
to
be
and
the
market
will
be
relieved
said
kit
juckes
a
macro
strategist
at
societe
generale
russian
financial

sold
off
sharply
the

bringing
its

oleg
deripaska
was
highlighted

its
dollar
bonds
maturing
were
trading
at
record
lows
around
cents
having
lost
half
their
value
since
the
sanctions
were
announced
it
is
very
serious
it
s
very
rare
that
you
see
a
country
literally
force
a
company
from
another
country
towards
bankruptcy
when
you
are
shut
out
of
dollar
funding
markets
a
lot
of
your
business
will
just
stop
working
saxo

garnry
said
adding
that
russia
s
smaller
role
in

limit
