problems
with
weldings
at
a
nuclear
reactor
under
construction
in
flamanville
are
worse
than
first
expected
and
may
impact
the
cost
and
startup
of
the
project
french
utility
edf
said
on
tuesday
when
edf
first
reported
weldings
problems
on
it
initially
said
there
would
be
no
impact
on
safety
costs
or
the
reactor
startup
schedule
however
france
s
asn
nuclear
regulator
warned
on
that
the
substandard
welding
could
well
have
an
impact
on
flamanville
s
startup
even
before
the
welding
problems
emerged
asn
had
warned
several
times
the
reactor
s
construction
schedule
was
tight
following
the
current
checks
and
the
licensing
process
by
the
asn
edf
will
be
able
to
specify
whether
the
project
requires
an
adjustment
to
its
timetable
and
its
costs
edf
said
in
a
statement
about
the
site
in
northern
france
edf
shares
fell
as
much
as
percent
in
early
trading
then
recovered
to
stand
one
percent
lower
any
major
further
delay
to
flamanville
s
epr
reactor
the
same
type
edf
is
building
in
hinkley
point
in
britain
could
add
hundreds
of
millions
of
euros
to
the
budget
and
negatively
impact
edf
earnings
the
flamanville
reactor
is
expected
to
load
nuclear
fuel
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
quarter
of
construction
started
in
with
a
launch
target
of
after
a
string
of
delays
its
cost
was
estimated
at
billion
euros
billion
in
more
than
three
times
its
original
budget
since
then
the
cost
has
not
been
updated
despite
the
discovery
of
several
additional
major
problems
notably
weak
spots
in
the
steel
of
its
containment
vessel
on
edf
said
of
areas
of
welding
on
the
reactor
secondary
cooling
circuit
were
not
in
line
with
standards
aimed
at
making
them
although
it
said
they
still
met
asn
requirements
but
on
tuesday
edf
said
additional
controls
of
all
weldings
on
the
circuit
had
shown
that
some
were
not
in
line
with
asn
requirements
some
weldings
will
have
to
be
redone

said
testing
and
review
of
the
welding
will
be
completed
by
the
end
of
may
after
which
edf
will
announce
any
impact
on
startup
timing
the
secondary
circuit
consists
of

to
