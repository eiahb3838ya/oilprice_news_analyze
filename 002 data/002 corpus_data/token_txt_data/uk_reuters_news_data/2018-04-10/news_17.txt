german
transport
minister
andreas
scheuer
denied
the
government
was
considering
setting
up
a
joint
fund
with
carmakers
to
pay
for
exhaust
systems
to
make
diesel
cars
cleaner
citing
legal
and
technical
concerns
about
retrofitting
older
cars
der
spiegel
magazine
reported
last
week
the
government
could
ask
carmakers
to
contribute
billion
euros
billion
to
such
a
fund
which
would
also
include
government
payments
scheuer
told
the
passauer
neue
presse
newspaper
on
tuesday
there
had
not
yet
been
any
discussion
about
funding
and
he
remained
committed
to
meeting
emissions
targets
using
measures
already
being
implemented
and
without
costly
hardware
retrofits
the
discussion
about
hardware
retrofits
is
not
appropriate
at
this
point
and
definitely
not
with
the
participation
of
taxpayers
he
told
the
newspaper
in
an
interview
the
issue
is
being
closely
watched
by
major
german
carmakers
volkswagen
daimler
and
bmw
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
and
her
cabinet
are
due
to
discuss
vehicle
emissions
and
how
to
avert
driving
bans
during
their
cabinet
retreat
this
week
after
germany
s
top
administrative
court
ruled
in
february
that
local
authorities
could
bar
heavily
polluting
diesel
cars
there
has
been
a
global
backlash
against
cars
since
volkswagen
vw
admitted
in
september
to
cheating
exhaust
tests
the
scandal
has
spread
across
the
industry
and
boosted
investment
in
electric
vehicles
of
the
million
diesel
cars
in
germany
only
million
are
equipped
with
the
latest
emissions
technology
scheuer
said
there
was
no
reason
to
panic
noting
a
combination
of
incentives
and
specific
measures
could
help
lower
emissions
in
cities
now
exceeding
permitted
levels
he
said
software
updates
of
some
million
diesel
cars
to
be
completed
by
the
auto
industry
by
the
end
of
the
year
would
reduce
emissions
by
up
to
percent
he
said
he
had
already
released
the
first
million
euros
of
million
euros
in
government
subsidies
to
fund
the
acquisition
of
electric
vehicles
for
public
infrastructure
agencies
the
initial
funds
would
pay
for
such
vehicles

said
