moscow
reuters
rusal
s
dollar
bonds
slumped
to
record
lows
two
major
customers
said
they
were
reviewing
their
contracts
and
the
london
metal
exchange
distanced
itself
from
the
aluminium
giant
on
tuesday
in
the
latest
aftershocks
from
sanctions
the
sanctions
imposed
on
rusal
and
its
boss
metals
magnate
oleg
deripaska
mark
the
first
time
a
major
international
company
has
been
targeted
by
washington
in
its
moves
to
punish
russia
for
alleged
meddling
in
the
election
while
russian
markets
including
the
rouble
fell
across
the
board
on
monday
rusal
assets
were
hardest
hit
with
its
hong
shares
halving
in
value
and
the
company
warning
it
risked
tipping
into
technical
default
on
tuesday
its
dollar
bonds
maturing
in
fell
cents
to
a
new
low
according
to
tradeweb
their
yields
had
previously
been
steady
at
around
percent
but
on
tuesday
spiked
to
percent
a
record
high
commodities
trader
glencore
a
rusal
shareholder
and
one
of
its
biggest
customers
said
it
was
evaluating
the
position
under
its
contracts
with
rusal
in
the
light
of
the
sanctions
glencore
chief
executive
ivan
glasenberg
also
resigned
from
his
role
as
a
rusal
director
deripaska
s
companies
have
seen
other
resignations
by
board
members
since
the
sanctions
with
his
newly
created
holding
company
group
saying
board
directors
dominique
fraisse
and
zhao
guangming
had
quit
on
april
and
respectively
to
offset
the
impact
of
the
punitive
measures
rusal
has
triggered
a
contingency
plan
asking
customers
to
pay
in
euros
instead
of
dollars
in
a
bid
to
skirt
the
sanctions
a
source
close
to
the
matter
said
this
follows
the
example
of
iran
which
a
few
years
ago
opted
to
use
gold
oil
and
the
japanese
yen
to
pay
for
goods
that
would
typically
be
priced
in
dollars
glencore
also
said
it
was
pulling
back
from
earlier
plans
to
swap
its
percent
stake
in
rusal
for
global
depository
receipts
in
glencore
is
committed
to
complying
with
all
applicable
sanctions
in
its
business
and
is
taking
all
necessary
measures
in
order
to
mitigate
any
risks
to
glencore
s
business
as
a
result
of
the
designation
of
rusal
and
as
sdns
specially
designated
nationals
including
in
respect
of
secondary
sanctions
glencore
said
in
a
statement
glencore
will
not
proceed
with
the
transaction
at
this
time
in
light
of
the
designation
of
rusal
and
as
sdns
it
said
matt
chamberlain
the
chief
executive
of
the
london
metal
exchange
lme
said
the
lme
would
take
steps
to
keep
aluminium
produced
by
rusal
and
sold
after
the
sanctions
were
imposed
out
of
its
warehouses
speaking
in
the
chilean
capital
chamberlain
said
aluminium
that
entered
lme
warehouses
before
the
sanctions
were
imposed
would
not
be
affected
the
websites
of
rusal
and
were
down
on
tuesday
evening
for
unknown
reasons
the
sanctions
explicitly
bar
entities
from
doing
business
with
rusal
but
the
impact
extended
to
companies
outside
the
united
states
too
they
are
wary
that
washington
could
slap
secondary
sanctions
on
them
if
they
are
deemed
to
be
facilitating
rusal
s
business
rio
tinto
a
rusal
customer
said
it
was
reviewing
its
trading
relationship
with
the
russian
firm
we
will
obviously
do
what
we
have
to
do
to
ensure
that
we
comply
with
applicable
sanctions
alf
barrios
rio
tinto
aluminium
s
chief
executive
said
in
an
interview
but
the
company
said
it
was
premature
to
speculate
on
the
future
of
an
australian
venture
of
which
rusal
is
part
owner
rusal
owns
percent
of
rio
s
queensland
alumina
operation
and
rio
owns
the
remaining
percent
according
to
a
rusal
prospectus
its
other
major
customers
include
toyota
other
foreign
firms
with
ties
to
deripaska
s
empire
include
austrian
construction
company
strabag
in
which
the
russian
s
firm
rasperia
has
a
blocking
stake
and
singapore
s
changi
airports
international
which
is
a
partner
with
a
airports
firm
the
sanctions
are
likely
to
mean
rusal
is
unable
to
pay
the
coupon
due
on
may
on
one
of
its
eurobonds
putting
the
company
in
technical
default
on
the
paper
investors
and
analysts
said
rusal
has
the
money
to
pay
the
coupon
which
is
the
interest
payment
on
the
bond
but
will
be
unable
to
make
the
payment
because
it
will
be
blocked
off
from
essential
bond
market
infrastructure
such
as
clearing
services
trading
platforms
and
correspondent
banks
market
participants
said
the
companies
that
provide
those
services
are
wary
that
if
they
have
to
handle
transactions
relating
to
the
rusal
bond
they
too
could
come
under
sanctions
risk
almost
all
of
rusal
s
billion
debt
is
making
it
difficult
for
the
company
to
make
repayments
since
the
sanctions
effectively
cut
off
its
access
to
the
banking
system
and
correspondent
banks
and
creditors
rusal
declined
to
comment
on
tuesday
on
monday
it
said
the
company
intends
to
continue
to
fulfil
its
existing
commitments
in
accordance
with
applicable
legal
and
regulatory
