new
fissures
roaring
like
jet
engines
and
spewing
magma
have
opened
on
hawaii
s
kilauea
volcano
piling
lava
as
high
as
a
building
as
the
geological
survey
warned
that
more
outbreaks
were
likely
a
crack
in
pasture
land
on
kilauea
s
east
flank
was
the

since
the
volcano
one
of
the
world
s
most
active
erupted
eight
days
ago
thousands
of
people
have
fled
their
homes
on
big
island
and
dozens
of
homes
have
been
destroyed
the
new
fissure
opened

about
a
mile
km
east
of
the

leilani
estates
neighbourhood
close
to
several
homes
on
the
edge
of
the
field
it
s
right
by
my
house

is
kind
of
scary

walked
to
see
the
new
crack
with
her
father
darryl
and
sister
jolon
it
s
really
from
afar
the
fissure
gave
off
dull
thumping
roars
that
sharpened
on
approach
to
a
scream
from
venting
steam
and
gas
mixed
with
the
slapping
sounds
of
liquid
lava
within
hours
of
opening
the
fissure
had
piled
lava
about
feet
meters
high
and
at
least
feet
meters
in
length
chunks
of
magma
were
being
spewed
feet
meters
in
the
air
the
intense
heat
left
onlookers
drenched
with
sweat
and
the
air
was
filled
with
an
acrid
burned
scent
but
with
billowing
gas
and
smoke
blowing
in
the
opposite
direction
there
was
no
pungent
smell
of
toxic
sulphur
dioxide
in
the
air

after
the
fissure
opened

and
spread

up

miles
km
kilauea

vents
have
been
oozing
relatively
cool
sluggish
magma
left
over
from
a
similar
event
in
fresher

could
now
emerge
behind
it

threatening
to
start
a
