trump administration axes project to generate power from plutonium
washington
may
reuters
the
trump
administration
plans
to
kill
a
project
it
says
would
have
cost
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
to
convert
plutonium
from
cold
nuclear
bombs
and
burn
it
to
generate
electricity
according
to
a
document
it
sent
to
the
senate
last
week
the
department
of
energy
submitted
a
document
on
may
to
the
senate
appropriations
committee
saying
that
the
mixed
oxide
mox
project
at
the
savannah
river
site
in
south
carolina
would
cost
about
billion
more
than
billion
already
spent
on
it
the
united
states
has
never
built
a
mox
plant
instead
of
completing
mox
the
administration
like
the
obama
administration
before
it
wants
to
blend
the
deadly
plutonium
with
an
inert
substance
and
bury
it
underground
in
a
new
mexico
s
waste
isolation
pilot
plant
wipp
burying
the
plutonium
would
cost
about
billion
according
to
the
document
a
copy
of
which
was
seen
by
reuters
we
are
currently
processing
plutonium
in
south
carolina
for
shipment
to
wipp
and
intend
to
continue
to
do
so
energy
secretary
rick
perry
said
in
a
letter
to
senator
richard
shelby
the
chairman
of
the
appropriations
committee
legislation
passed
in
february
allows
the
energy
department
to
advance
burying
the
plutonium
if
it
showed
that
the
cost
would
be
less
than
half
of
completing
mox
south
carolina
politicians
including
senator
lindsey
graham
have
defended
the
mox
plant
saying
it
is
about
percent
complete
would
help
keep
plutonium
out
of
the
hands
of
militants
and
provide
up
to
direct
jobs
south
carolina
s
governor
henry
mcmaster
complained
to
perry
in
a
letter
earlier
this
month
that
the
energy
department
s
dilution
plan
is
at
best
south
carolina
which
has
already
sued
the
department
over
the
mox
plant
will
use
all
legal
recourses
available
to
continue
the
program
mcmaster
said
the
energy
department
has
deemed
the
savannah
site
could
be
used
to
manufacture
new
plutonium
pits
or
triggers
for
nuclear
weapons
an
idea
mcmaster
said
was
an
attempt
to
pacify
south
carolina
but
would
not
provide
jobs
for
many
years
the
energy
department
document
estimated
that
diluting
the
plutonium
would
require
jobs
at
savannah
river
through
the
late
edwin
lyman
a
physicist
at
science
advisory
group
the
union
of
concerned
scientists
concerned
about
plutonium
getting
into
the
wrong
hands
said
perry
had
made
a
sensible
decision
mox
was
a
train
wreck
and
throwing
good
money
after
bad
simply
wasn
t
