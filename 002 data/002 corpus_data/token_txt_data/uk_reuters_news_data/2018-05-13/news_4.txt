nigeria
s
former
vice
president
atiku
abubakar
will
privatise
parts
of
the
country
s
state
oil
company
and
allow
the
naira
currency
to
float
to
attract
foreign
investment
if
elected
as
head
of
state
he
told
reuters
abubakar
also
confirmed
that
he
intends
to
run
in
next
year
s
presidential
election
becoming
the
biggest
opposition
heavyweight
to
say
he
will
take
on
muhammadu
buhari
the
winner
of
february
s
poll
will
lead
africa
s
top
oil
producer
and
most
populous
nation
which
is
central
to
regional
stability
as
it
battles
islamist
militants
in
the
northeast
abubakar
a
former
key
ally
of
president
buhari
whose
resources
helped
propel
him
to
power
quit
the
ruling
party
in
november
and
the
opposition
people
s
democratic
party
pdp
a
month
later
he
has
long
enjoyed
support
from
the
business
elite
in
nigeria
s
commercial
capital
lagos
for
his
ideals
and
as
vice
president
in
a
pdp
administration
from
he
implemented
a
programme
of
liberalisation
in
areas
including
telecoms
sector
abubakar
said
he
would
go
further
if
elected
president
i
am
also
going
to
expand
it
to
include
the
oil
and
gas
sector
which
have
not
been
touched
at
all
and
other
major
sectors
of
the
economy
like
mining
solid
minerals
he
said
abubakar
said
he
would
privatise
parts
of
nigerian
national
petroleum
corporation
nnpc
which
has
been
beset
by
decades
of
mismanagement
and
is
crucial
to
the
opec
member
s
economic
fortunes
he
did
not
specify
the
parts
that
would
be
privatised
i
am
a
strong
believer
in
very
very
small
government
and
also
the
private
sector
he
said
a
drop
in
crude
oil
prices
from
late
pushed
nigeria
into
its
first
recession
in
years
in
spawning
chronic
dollar
shortages
because
oil
receipts
make
up
of
government
revenue
and
most
of
the
country
s
foreign
exchange
the
economy
moved
out
of
recession
last
year
but
growth
remains
weak
and
multiple
exchange
rates
remain
in
place
imposed
by
the
central
bank
to
support
buhari
s
insistence
that
the
naira
should
not
be
allowed
to
float
i
will
allow
the
naira
to
float
because
i
believe
that
is
one
of
the
ways
foreign
direct
investment
can
be
encouraged
to
come
in
said
abubakar
who
hopes
to
replicate
buhari
s
feat
of
winning
a
presidential
election
at
the
fourth
attempt
buhari
who
took
office
in
and
whoever
becomes
president
next
will
face
challenges
ranging
from
weak
economic
growth
to
communal
violence
between
herdsmen
and
farmers
as
well
as
the
boko
haram
insurgency
abubakar
who
like
buhari
is
a
muslim
from
the
north
said
voters
would
welcome
someone
who
could
revive
their
fortunes
adding
that
of
his
three
previous
presidential
campaigns
he
was
only
once
rejected
by
the
electorate
he
was
not
selected
as
a
party
candidate
on
the
other
two
occasions
parties
must
select
their
candidate
by
the
next
president
should
be
a
northerner
under
an
unofficial
agreement
under
which
the
presidency
alternates
between
the
north
and
south
after
every
two
terms
bismarck
rewane
chief
executive
of
consultancy
financial
derivatives
said
the
former
vice
president
s
familiarity
and
age
could
be
a
disadvantage
to
upset
the
buhari
candidature
you
need
something
different
someone
young
energetic
and
charismatic
you
need
something
distinct
from
the
current
leadership
he
said
abubakar
lacked
buhari
s
popularity
in
northern
states
and
at
just
four
years
younger
than
the
president
would
struggle
to
generate
appeal
rewane
