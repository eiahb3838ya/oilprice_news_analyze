are
likely
after
suspected
islamist
militants
beheaded
people
and
killed
seven
others
since
may
any
sign
of
militant
activity
is
a
concern
for
the
country

fledgling
gas

and
the
area
around
the
town
of
palma
near

advise
american

of
imminent
more
than
billion
is
expected
to
be
invested
in
mozambique
s
natural
gas
sector
to
build
capacity
to
produce
million

per
year
of
lng
with
the
first
exports
from

mozambique
has
not

a
focal
point
of

militant
activity
in
the
past
and
police
have
been
reluctant

to
islamists
mozambique
has
little
history
of
militant
activity
and
police
are
reluctant
to
ascribe
