s
biggest
pipeline
operator
enbridge
inc
said
on
monday
it
was
taking
steps
to
address
complaints
from
oil
shipper
bp
plc
about
abrupt
changes
it
made
in
allocating
space
on
its
mainline
system
the
company
announced
the
policy
change
late
last
month
before
reversing
it
last
week
after
it
caused
panic
among
shippers
and
dramatically
increased
a
discount
on
canadian
heavy
crude
enbridge
had
intended
to
change
how
it
verifies
shippers
oil
supplies
before
dividing
up
capacity
on
the
mainline
to
prevent
shippers
from
overestimating
how
much
crude
they
had
to
move
a
problem
known
as
air
in
a
letter
to
canadian
regulator
the
national
energy
board
neb
enbridge
said
it
would
not
use
the
revised
system
in
august
and
had
no
plans
to
do
so
thereafter
the
company
also
said
in
response
to
bp
s
concerns
that
it
would
not
implement
any
further
changes
during
the
trading
period
the
first
three
weeks
of
the
month
prior
to
shipment
when
sales
and
scheduling
decisions
are
made
enbridge
said
it
would
give
shippers
at
least
one
calendar
month
s
notice
of
future
changes
enbridge
said
in
light
of
its
actions
there
should
be
no
need
for
the
neb
to
continue
a
process
of
receiving
industry
feedback
on
the
situation
bp
could
not
be
immediately
reached
