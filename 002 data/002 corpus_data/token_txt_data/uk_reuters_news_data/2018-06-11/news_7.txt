keeping
healthy
could
become
more
costly
as
climate
change
and
water
scarcity
cause
a
huge
drop
in
the
global
production
of
vegetables
and
legumes
scientists
said
on
monday
the
amount
of
vegetables
produced
could
fall
by
more
than
a
third
especially
in
hot
regions
like
southern
europe
and
swathes
of
africa
and
south
asia
said
researchers
from
the
london
school
of
hygiene
and
tropical
medicine
by
analysing
studies
across
countries
with
some
dating
as
far
back
as
they
found
that
hikes
in
greenhouses
gases
water
scarcity
and
global
temperatures
lowered
the
amount
of
vegetables
and
legumes
produced
such
drastic
changes
could
drive
up
the
prices
of
vegetables
which
would
affect
poorer
communities
the
most
according
to
the
study
which
was
published
in
the
proceedings
of
the
national
academy
of
sciences
if
we
take
a
business
as
usual
approach
environmental
changes
will
substantially
reduce
the
global
availability
of
these
important
foods
said
alan
dangour
a
of
the
paper
which
is
the
first
of
its
kind
in
a
statement
scientists
have
warned
that
world
temperatures
are
likely
to
rise
by
degrees
to
degrees
celsius
this
century
compared
with
times
this
could
lead
to
dangerous
weather
patterns
including
more
frequent
and
powerful
droughts
floods
and
storms
increasing
the
pressure
on
agriculture
food
production
itself
is
a
major
contributor
to
climate
change
agriculture
forestry
and
changes
in
land
use
together
produce
nearly
a
quarter
of
global
greenhouse
gas
emissions
making
them
the
second
largest
emitter
after
the
energy
sector
said
the
united
nations
food
and
agriculture
organisation
the
volume
of
food
transported
around
the
world
also
is
exacerbating
global
warming
the
global
demand
for
food
is
expected
to
soar
as
the
world
s
population
is
projected
to
grow
to
billion
people
by
up
from
billion
today
according
to
the
crops
now
take
up
percent
of
the
world
s
land
surface
and
livestock
grazing
covers
percent
of
land
according
to
the
organisation
for
economic
and
development
oecd
farming
accounts
for
about
percent
of
all
water
used
globally
said
the
oecd
water
scarcity
already
affects
more
than
percent
of
the
world
s
population
according
to
the
that
number
is
expected
to
rise
due
to
global
warming
with
one
in
four
people
projected
to
face
chronic
or
recurring
shortages
by
the
said
urgent
action
needs
to
be
taken
including
working
to
support
the
agriculture
sector
to
increase
its
resilience
to
environmental
changes
said
dangour

this
must
be
a
priority
