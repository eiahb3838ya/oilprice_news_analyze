trump's coal, nuclear bailout no shield from hackers -cyber experts
washington
reuters
bailing
out
nuclear
and
power
plants
will
not
toughen
the
power
grid
against
cyber
attacks
as
the
trump
administration
claims
according
to
cyber
experts
because
hackers
have
a
wide
array
of
options
for
hitting
electric
infrastructure
and
nuclear
facilities
that
are
targets
president
donald
trump
this
month
directed
energy
secretary
rick
perry
to
take
emergency
steps
to
stem
a
surge
in
coal
and
nuclear
plant
retirements
in
recent
years
arguing
that
more
shutdowns
would
leave
the
country
less
able
to
bounce
back
from
disruptions
caused
by
storms
physical
attacks
and
hackers
the
announcement
came
as
the
national
security
council
debated
a
department
of
energy
doe
memo
that
said
cyber
and
physical
threats
are
minimized
at
nuclear
and
coal
plants
because
they
can
store
months
of
fuel
on
site
to
survive
a
supply
cut
unlike
natural
gas
facilities
that
rely
on
pipeline
networks
or
wind
and
solar
installations
that
need
the
right
weather
while
the
administration
had
been
arguing
for
months
that
fuel
secure
facilities
were
important
to
america
s
ability
to
rebound
from
storms
and
physical
attacks
its
efforts
to
link
plant
closures
with
protection
from
cyber
attacks
appeared
to
open
a
new
front
in
its
support
for
the
coal
and
nuclear
industries
chris
bronk
a
professor
of
computer
and
information
systems
at
the
university
of
houston
said
he
could
not
endorse
the
idea
i
don
t
see
where
a
policy
of
keeping
open
aging
infrastructure
that
would
shut
unless
there
was
federal
markets
intervention
keeps
us
any
safer
from
cyber
attacks
he
said
bronk
said
coal
plants
train
deliveries
and
transmission
systems
are
just
as
susceptible
to
hackers
as
gas
pipelines
and
added
that
while
nuclear
facilities
are
tough
targets
the
stakes
involved
in
a
successful
nuclear
cyber
attack
are
enormous
potentially
involving
an
accident
that
leaks
radioactivity
and
hits
surrounding
communities
nuclear
power
backers
stress
that
reactors
are
protected
from
hackers
by
so
called
air
gaps
isolating
them
from
unsecured
networks
but
bronk
said
air
gaps
are
not
impervious
to
attackers
that
may
seek
to
gain
information
such
as
worker
and
maintenance
schedules
from
administrative
networks
over
long
periods
of
time
those
are
the
control
systems
that
frighten
me
to
no
end
bronk
said
sergio
caltagirone
the
director
of
threat
intelligence
at
cyber
security
company
dragos
agreed
that
bailing
out
nuclear
and
coal
plants
offers
little
protection
i
do
not
expect
this
policy
shift
to
deliver
any
additional
cyber
security
resilience
based
on
the
threats
we
re
actively
monitoring
caltagirone
said
a
doe
official
who
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
said
the
agency
recognizes
that
cyber
security
risk
permeates
every
energy
source
but
the
official
said
there
is
concern
that
natural
gas
s
role
has
grown
too
rapidly
in
the
last
decade
making
the
grid
vulnerable
to
hacks
on
pipelines
that
could
knock
out
to
natural
gas
plants
in
one
fell
while
the
administration
talks
about
gas
pipelines
nuclear
plants
have
also
been
attacked
in
march
the
trump
administration
blamed
russia
for
seeking
to
penetrate
multiple
types
of
infrastructure
including
nuclear
water
and
manufacturing
and
last
july
news
reports
said
wolf
creek
nuclear
operating
corp
which
runs
a
nuclear
power
plant
in
kansas
had
been
targeted
by
hackers
wolf
creek
said
there
was
no
operational
damage
and
sensitive
systems
were
separate
from
the
corporate
network
ben
garber
a
cyber
security
engineer
for
ultra
electronics
said
the
government
should
put
greater
focus
on
encouraging
power
utilities
to
strengthen
security
against
attacks
as
it
has
with
the
financial
and
health
industries
the
doe
said
in
february
it
is
forming
an
office
of
cyber
security
to
do
that
trump
s
fiscal
year
budget
included
million
to
fund
it
but
trump
has
not
yet
nominated
a
leader
to
run
it
cameron
camp
a
researcher
at
slovakian
software
maker
eset
said
the
push
to
subsidize
coal
and
nuclear
seemed
more
about
saving
blue
collar
energy
jobs
than
boosting
resiliency
it
s
trying
to
kill
multiple
birds
with
one
stone
rather
than
take
a
holistic
view
of
the
structural
problems
with
the
grid
itself
