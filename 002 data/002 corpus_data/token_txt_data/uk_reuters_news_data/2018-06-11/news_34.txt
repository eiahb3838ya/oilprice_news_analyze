ahead

an
historic
korea
summit
that
investors
hope
might
pave
the
way
to
ending
a

on
the
korean
peninsula
stocks
wobbled
in
early
trade
after
president
donald
trump
raised
fresh
fears
of
a
global
trade
war
when
he
backed
out
of
a
joint
group
of
seven
communique
over
the
weekend
in
a
blow
to
the
group
s
efforts
to
show
a
united
front
the

what
took
place
at
the
weekend
was
within
the
scope
of
earlier
expectations
and
while
the
countries
disagreed
on
trade
they
did
seem
to
show
a
unified
front
on
the
north
korean
issue
so
there
is
also
a
positive
element
from
the
affecting
risk
sentiment
said
masahiro
ichikawa
senior
strategist
at
sumitomo
mitsui
asset
management
after
the
meeting
the
president
withdrew
his
support
for
its
communique
and
raised
fresh
trade
concerns
by
taking
aim
at
canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
amid
a
spat
over
import
tariffs
the
meeting
in
canada
reiterated
the
growing
rift
between
washington
and
its
allies
over
free
trade
wrote
tai
hui
chief
market
strategist
for
asia
pacific
at
morgan
asset
management
business
confidence
and
subsequently
capital
spending
is
at
risk
if
this
tension
continues
through
the
summer
he
said
adding
that
central
bank
meetings
will
be
critical
events
this
week
trump
and
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
will
have
an
unprecedented
meeting
on
tuesday
in
singapore
possibly
laying
the
groundwork
for
ending
a
nuclear
between
the
old
foes
some
analysts
also
raised
the
prospect
of
international
sanctions
against
north
korea
being
lifted
there
are
many
obstacles
that
will
need
to
be
overcome
if
a
deal
between
the
us
and
north
korea
is
to
be
agreed
not
least
a
lack
of
trust
between
the
two
sides

economics
wrote
in
a
note
to
clients
nevertheless
the
improvement
in
ties
between
the
us
and
north
korea
has
at
least
made
the
possibility
of
a
deal
which
sees
economic
sanctions
on
north
korea
being
lifted
seem
a
little
less
investors

got
prepared
for
a
raft
of
other
key
events
the

holds
a

starting
on
june
and
it
is
widely
expected
to
raise

for
the
second
time
this
year
the
focus
is
on
whether
the
central
bank
will
hint
at
raising
rates
a
total
of
four
times
in
the
european
central
bank
meets
on
june
when
it
could
signal
intentions
to
start
unwinding
its
