s
oil
minister
said
on
monday
producers
should
not
be
influenced
by
pressure
to
pump
more
oil
and
unilateral
decisions
on
output
could
be
a
breach
of
a
supply
cut
pact
between
opec
and
countries
that
could
lead
to
its
collapse
jabar
said
in
a
statement
that
oil
prices
still
needed
more
support
and
stability
and
producers
should
not
over
exaggerate
the
need
of
the
oil
market
for
more
oil
supplies
in
the
time
the
minister
rejects
unilateral
decisions
by
some
oil
producers
without
consulting
the
rest
of
the
members
of
the
opec
and
pact
that
took
part
in
the
reduction
agreement
according
