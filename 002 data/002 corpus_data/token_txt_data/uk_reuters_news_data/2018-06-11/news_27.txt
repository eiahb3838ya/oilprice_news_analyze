in
most
vehicles
by
the
end
of
september
according
to
a
document
published
on
the
city
government
s
website
on
monday
as
beijing
pushes
for
adoption
of
the
biofuel
nationwide
the
central
government
said
last
year
that
it
plans
to
roll
out
the
use
of
gasoline
blended
with
percent
added
ethanol
nationally
by
to
cut
corn
stocks
and
clean
up
choking
smog
the
move
by
tianjin
a
port
city
of
around
million
people
in
northern
china
was
the
first
official
plan
by
a
provincial
government
to
implement
the
national
policy
since
it
was
announced
tianjin
is
expected
to
use
tonnes
of
fuel
ethanol
each
year
if
that
goal
is
realized
the
city
government
said
that
would
mean
consumption
of
tonnes
of
corn
as
three
tonnes
of
corn
would
be
used
to
make
one
tonne
of
ethanol
china
is
currently
sitting
on
huge
stocks
of
corn
estimated
to
be
at
about
million
tonnes

stockpiling
scheme
to
support
farmers
china
currently
produces
less
than
million
tonnes
of
ethanol
a
year
but
the
new
policy
could
increase
demand
to
million
tonnes
a
year
by

to
a
reuters
estimate
domestic
producers
were
ramping
up
output
on
cheaper
corn
and
government
subsidies
hoping
to
get
a
share
in
the
potentially
booming
market
