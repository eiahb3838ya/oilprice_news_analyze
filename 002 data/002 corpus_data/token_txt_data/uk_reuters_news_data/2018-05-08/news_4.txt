reuters
iran
s
exports
of
oil
to
china
europe
and
other
countries
will
decline
later
this
year
and
into
if
the
united
states
can
enforce
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
reimpose
the
highest
level
of
economic
sanctions
targeting
oil
trade
with
iran
refining
company
sources
said
asia
s
petroleum
refiners
have
shifted
purchases
to
other
exporters
in
preparation
for
the
renewal
of
sanctions
against
opec
member
iran
which
currently
exports
about
million
barrels
of
oil
a
day
with
china
india
and
other
asian
nations
the
primary
customers
trump
on
tuesday
announced
the
withdrawal
from
the
iran
deal
which
was
struck
between
major
world
powers
and
the
middle
eastern
nation
in
and
the
renewal
of
sanctions
to
the
highest
level
on
tehran
we
re
expecting
it
to
dissuade
some
buyers
from
purchasing
iranian
crude
said
bob
mcnally
president
of
consultancy
rapidan
energy
group
in
washington
the
deal
had
limited
iran
s
nuclear
ambitions
in
exchange
for
removing
joint
sanctions
against
the
middle
eastern
country
iran
now
produces
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
accounting
for
about
percent
of
world
supply
any
decline
in
shipments
would
not
be
immediate
as
sanctions
would
not
come
into
effect
for
days
allies
in
europe
on
tuesday
said
they
were
looking
to
find
ways
to
preserve
what
was
left
of
the
agreement
european
and
asian
importers
may
however
soon
find
themselves
faced
with
the
choice
of
doing
business
with
the
united
states
or
iran
we
think
everyone
is
going
to
scramble
to
call
the
white
house
and
get
an
exemption
mcnally
said
the
trajectory
of
sales
could
match
what
happened
after
tough
western
sanctions
were
put
in
place
in
early
then
iran
s
foreign
sales
fell
to
just
over
million
bpd
with
the
majority
coming
from
four
buyers
china
india
japan
and
south
korea
currently
the
biggest
buyer
of
iran
s
crude
is
china
whose
imports
peaked
at
about
bpd
in
but
have
dropped
to
around
bpd
in
according
to
thomson
reuters
ship
tracking
data
chinese
refiners
said
iran
currently
had
a
relatively
small
share
in
its
supplies
and
alternatives
would
be
easy
to
find
in
russia
saudi
arabia
west
africa
and
the
united
states
international
oil
prices
hit
their
highest
since
late
this
week
on
worries
that
revived
sanctions
would
tighten
global
supplies
moody
s
analytics
said
sanctions
would
reduce
iranian
production
by
about
bpd
the
united
states
may
struggle
to
enforce
sanctions
against
iran
to
the
same
level
as
earlier
in
the
decade
then
the
european
union
s
support
for
the
united
states
measures
made
it
difficult
for
refiners
to
transport
and
purchase
crude
this
time
european
countries
do
not
support
policy
the
governments
of
france
germany
and
the
united
kingdom
all
said
on
tuesday
they
wanted
to
stick
to
the
deal
and
urged
the
not
to
obstruct
that
what
made
the
sanctions
enforced
during
the
obama
era
so
effective
was
precisely
the
fact
that
they
were
whereas
president
trump
s
sanctions
are
not
wrote
chris
lafakis
moody
s
chief
economist
some
refiners
in
japan
and
south
korea
said
they
had
already
taken
measures
to
prepare
for
potential
new
curbs
on
iranian
supplies
by
shifting
to
alternatives
a
source
with
a
korean
petrochemical
company
said
that
the
main
problem
for
korean
importers
was
finding
equivalent
oil
specifications
for
iran
s
supplies
refiners
are
designed
to
use
specific
qualities
of
crude
and
korean
facilities
are
geared
for
iranian
condensate
a
form
of
crude
while
there
are
alternatives
including
from
the
united
states
or
qatar
specifications
and
prices
vary
we
can
source
from
qatar
depending
on
price
the
source
said
in
the
case
of
light
crude
it
s
not
that
economical
to
use
at
the
moment
and
doesn
t
fit
well
with
korean
during
the
last
round
of
sanctions
india
enjoyed
waivers
that
allowed
it
to
continue
to
import
limited
amounts
of
iranian
oil
under
certain
fiscal
restraints
including
paying
iran
in
india
s
rupee
instead
of
the
dollar
the
impact
of
potential
new
sanctions
in
india
will
be
there
but
not
so
high

the

saudi

would
work
with
other
opec
and
producers
to
lessen
the
impact
of
any
shortage
in
oil
supplies
a
saudi
energy
official
said
on
wednesday
inventories
in
major
developed
nations
have
fallen
sharply
in
the
last
to
billion
barrels
slightly
above
their
average
after
opec
and
producers
such
as
russia
cut
supply
at
the
beginning
of
to
end
a
global
glut
now
some
market
participants
say
the
market
could
tighten
dramatically
after
years
of
oversupply
i
think
we
re
going
to
next
year

said
