for
all
the
bullish
commentary
around
oil
prices
at
the
moment
hedge
fund
managers
have
made
only
minor
changes
to
their
overall
position
in
petroleum
futures
and
options
in
the
last
few
weeks
to
the
extent
they
have
made
any
changes
at
all
fund
managers
have
been
reducing
rather
than
adding
to
bullish

have
reduced
their

for
two
consecutive
weeks
to
billion
barrels
by

from
a
recent
peak
of
billion

on

in
a
repeat
of
the
week
before
the

last

concentrated
in

increased
their
exposure
to

the
fundamental
outlook
remains
fairly
bullish

and
exports
from

are
declining
and
the
united

is
threatening
to
withdraw
from
the

nuclear
agreement
which
could
cut
that

exports
in
the

months

hedge

have
already
amassed
a
bullish

positioning
has
become
exceptionally
stretched

lopsided
across
the
petroleum
complex
with
hedge

long
positions
outnumbering
short
ones
by
a
ratio
of
almost
and
as
much
as
in
the
case
of

managers
show
no
inclination
to
