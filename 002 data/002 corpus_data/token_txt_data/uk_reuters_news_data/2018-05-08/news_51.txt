london
reuters
british
regulators
have
launched
an
investigation
into
the
between
the
retail
power
unit
of
sse
plc
and
npower
owned
by
germany
s
innogy
saying
it
may
reduce
competition
and
increase
prices
for
some
households
the
merger
would
create
britain
s
retail
power
provider
and
reduce
the
big
six
dominating
the
market
to
five
companies
when
they
are
already
facing
political
scrutiny
for
their
tariffs
and
pressure
from
smaller
rivals
it
also
comes
as
german
energy
giants
rwe
and
plan
to
carve
up
innogy
the
deal
would
make
another
of
the
big
six
the
parent
company
of
npower
analysts
say
this
may
complicate
the
merger
the
competition
and
markets
authority
cma
warned
at
the
end
of
april
it
would
launch
a
deeper
probe
which
typically
lasts
weeks
and
can
be
extended
unless
the
two
companies
propose
solutions
that
would
lift
its
concerns
sse
and
npower
did
not
offer
measures
to
address
the
cma
s
concerns
and
so
it
has
referred
the
merger
for
a
more
phase
investigation
the
regulator
said
in
a
statement
the
deadline
for
the
final
report
is
combined
sse
and
npower
would
have
million
customers
making
the
new
company
second
only
to
centrica
s
british
gas
which
has
more
than
million
customer
accounts
chief
financial
officer
marc
spieker
said
he
expected
the
deal
to
go
ahead
but
should
it
be
blocked
s
own
plans
for
a
larger
asset
swap
with
innogy
s
parent
company
rwe
would
not
be
affected
even
before
the
announcement
of
the
merger
last
november
the
industry
had
faced
criticism
as
household
bills
doubled
over
the
past
decade
despite
years
of
market
liberalization
that
was
meant
to
make
energy
more
affordable
last
month
the
influential
business
energy
and
industrial
strategy
committee
of
lawmakers
said
the
deal
could
damage
competition
and
would
reduce
consumer
choices
they
had
already
called
the
energy
market
broken
on
tuesday
however
the
two
parent
companies
disagreed
we
did
not
put
forward
measures
to
address
the
cma
s
concerns
because
we
firmly
believe
this
merger
will
be
good
for
competition
as
it
stands
innogy
said
in
an
emailed
statement
it
will
create
an
independent
company
offering
customers
a
more
efficient
improved
service
and
bring
benefits
to
the
wider
market
as
sse
said
it
was
on
track
to
complete
the
formation
and
listing
of
the
new
company
in
the
last
quarter
of
or
first
quarter
of
despite
the
investigation
a
phase
referral
is
a
process
for
transactions
of
this
nature
and
we
remain
confident
that
the
proposed
merger
will
deliver
benefits
for
customers
and
the
energy
market
as
a
whole
sse
chief
executive
alistair
said
in
a
statement
the
british
market
is
dominated
by
british
gas
sse
iberdrola
s
scottish
power
npower
and
edf
energy
which
account
for
about
percent
of
the
retail
electricity
market
but
those
six
companies
held
percent
of
the
market
share
just
three
years
ago
and
have
shed
customers
to
much
smaller
rivals
increasing
pressure
on
their
revenues
additionally
the
government
plans
to
impose
price
caps
on
the
most
common
tariff
from
these
companies
the
standard
variable
tariff
by
the
winter
of
this
year

may
called
