but
off
the

for
the
day
after
president
donald
trump
confirmed
the
will
withdraw
from
the
deal
with
iran
to
curb
its
nuclear
program
brent
crude
oil
futures
briefly
turned
positive
after
trump
said
the
will
withdraw
from
a
international
agreement
designed
to
deny
tehran
the
ability
to
build
nuclear
weapons
and
said
the
will
institute
the
highest
level
of
sanctions
on
iran
iran

about
million
barrels
per

bpd
and
the
country
is
the
producer
among
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
behind
saudi
arabia
and
iraq
its
production
accounts
for
about
percent
of
the
world
s
oil
supplies
as
an
energy
investor
trump
announced
everything
that
one
could
possibly
have
wanted
him
to
say
said
eric
nuttall
partner
and
senior
portfolio
manager
at
ninepoint
partners
in
toronto
it
gives
one
confidence
that
there
could
be
a
reduction
in
the
physical
movement
of
barrels
and
this
also
puts
at
stake
the
medium
and
growth
ambitions
of
iran
to
grow
their
production
and
oil
prices
had
been
supported
over
the
past
month
by
expectations
that
trump
would
pull
out
of
the
deal
which
could
hit
iranian
crude
exports
and
feed
geopolitical
tensions
in
the
middle
east
home
to
a
third
of
the
world
s
daily
oil
supply
since
the
exemption
from
sanctions
came
into
effect
iran
s
crude
oil
exports
have
risen
to
about
million
bpd
from
less
than
one
million
bpd
goldman
sachs
said
in
a
note
that
it
was
unclear
if
a
million
bpd
in
exports
would
be
at
risk
as
it
was
from
to
a
majority
of
iran
s
exports
currently
go
to
asia
with
europe
receiving
about
bpd
earlier
in
the
session
prices
plunged
as
media
reports
rattled
markets
with
doubts
about
whether
trump
would
withdraw
washington
from
the
deal

most
had
expected

struck

as
much
as

trump
s
announcement
had
been
baked
into
the
cake
in
recent
days
hence
we
saw
prices
selling
off
today
given
the
air
of
certainty
surrounding

regardless
of
what
trump
does
with
this
iran

any

are
going
to
be

the

is
the
risk
