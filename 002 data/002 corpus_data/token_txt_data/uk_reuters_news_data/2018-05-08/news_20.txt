the
global
crude
benchmark
briefly
turned
positive
after
trump
announced
the
withdrawal
from
the
international
agreement
aimed
at
stopping
iran
from
obtaining
a
nuclear
bomb
trump
said
the
united
states
was
reimposing
the
highest
level
of
economic
sanctions
on
iran
but
he
did
not
provide
details
oil
prices
plunged
earlier
as
markets
were
rattled
by
media
reports
on
doubts
of
whether
trump
would
withdraw
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
as
most
had
expected
crude
settled
down
at

down

continued
to
pare
losses
in
post
trade
it
was
the
busiest
day
in
contracts
since
august
and
for
brent
the
busiest
in
almost
a
month
oil
prices
had
been
supported
by
expectations
that
trump
would
pull
out
of
the
deal
which
could
crimp
iranian
crude
exports
and
feed
geopolitical
tensions
in
the

trump
s
announcement
had
been
baked
into
the
cake
in
recent
days
hence
we
saw
prices
selling
off
today
given
the
air
of
certainty
surrounding
it

matt
smith
director
of
commodity
research
at
clipperdata
the
dollar
advanced
to
new
highs
for
against
a
basket
of
six
trading
currencies
on
worries
about
political
turmoil
in
italy
but
later
pared
gains
on
the
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
iran
deal
and
emerging
market
currencies
slid
on
worries
about
the
withdrawal
which
would
curb
risk
appetite
in
financial
markets
overall
it
doesn
t
change
the
story
on
dollar
strength
