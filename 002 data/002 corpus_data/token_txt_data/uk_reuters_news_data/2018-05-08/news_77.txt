one
of
the
most
influential

due
to
its
annual
production
of

we
are

we
are
looking

things
said
in
an
interview
at
qp
s
headquarters
in
doha
we
are
looking
very
critically
at
the
united
states
because
we
have
a
position
there
we
have
the
golden
pass
that
we
are
investing
in

owner
of

expanding

year
i
m
not
in
the
business
of
infrastructure
i
m
not
going
to
have
a
liquefaction
plant
only
it
has
to
be
something
that
will
be
linked
with
an
upstream
business
that
we
would
buy
in
the
so
we
need
to
be
naturally
hedged
he
added
to
maintain
its
dominance
in
the
united
states
and
australia
qp
is
cutting
costs
at
home
and
seeking
to
expand
overseas
through
joint
ventures
with
international
companies
we
will
always
go
with
one
of
our
international
partners
that
we
have
business
with
here
in
qatar
said
some
of
our
partners
want
to
divest
some
of
our
partners
want
to
acquire
something
qp
is
focusing
on
other
opportunities
in
mexico
latin
america
africa
and
in
the
mediterranean
he
said
qp
is
also
looking
to
enter
mozambique
where
exxon
and
eni
operate
he
added
said
the
share
of
overseas
upstream
production
will
be
a
good
portion
in
the
but
it
won
t
compare
to
its
share
at
home
our
strategy
says
we
are
going
to
expand
in
upstream
business
with
a
little
bit
of
downstream
that
will
be
connected
to
some
other
businesses
that
we
are
doing
and
a
few
deals
in
petrochemicals
he
said
for
qatar
which
is
locked
in
a
dispute
with
four
arab
states
broadening
its
investments
outside
the
middle
east
would
cement
its
position
as
the
world
s
largest
lng
supplier
and
help
it
to
weather
the
boycott
with
its
neighbours
in

the
united
arab
emirates
bahrain
and
egypt

five
to
seven
years
the
announcement
came
at
a
time
of
an
oversupply
in
the
lng
market
but
said
such
a
glut
would
disappear
in
driven
by
the
rising
demand
for
gas
amid
the
global

towards
cleaner
fuels
and
climate
change
concerns
