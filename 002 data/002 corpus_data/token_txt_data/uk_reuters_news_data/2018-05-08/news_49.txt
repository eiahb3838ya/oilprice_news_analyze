when
qatar
s
gulf
neighbours
and
egypt
sought
to
isolate
doha
with
a
boycott
imposed
last
year
the
nation
s
top
energy
official
kept
a
cool
head
and
ensured
oil
and
gas
exports
barely
felt
a
hiccup
saad
a
engineer
who
rose
the
ranks
to
become
chief
executive
of
qatar
petroleum
qp
in
had
a
contingency
plan
to
hand
to
maintain
energy
flows
that
account
for
percent
of
the
arab
nation
s
state
revenues
it
was
the
best
stress
test
we
can
have
for
our
system
to
show
whether
we
are
really
up
for
a
challenge
said
in
a
reuters
interview
in
doha
brushing
of
the
boycott
s
impact
when
the
blockade
happened
we
had
a
business
continuity
plan
in
every
company
he
said
in
his
simply
furnished
first
floor
office
in
the
capital
of
a
nation
that
has
become
the
world
s
wealthiest
per
capita
because
of
its
huge
gas
reserves
his
understated
office
layout
gives
little
indication
that
is
one
of
qatar
s
most
powerful
figures
a
man
who
is
not
a
member
of
the
ruling
family
but
who
has
nonetheless
climbed
to
one
of
the
country
s
top
jobs
he
has
gained
a
reputation
among
executives
of
the
world
s
energy
majors
such
as
exxon
shell
and
total
as
a
reliable
counterpart
for
energy
projects
that
have
made
the
tiny
nation
of
million
people
the
biggest
exporter
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
on
the
planet
qp
has
been
a
top
partner
for
many
years
and
saad
made
it
even
more
solid
said
an
executive
at
one
of
the
three
majors
his
steady
hand
proved
critical
when
neighbours
saudi
arabia
the
united
arab
emirates
and
bahrain
alongside
egypt
severed
diplomatic
economic
and
transport
ties
in
june
accusing
doha
of
supporting
terrorism
charges
qatar
denies
the
boycott
came
as
a
particular
surprise
given
had
been
in
talks
months
earlier
to
supply
gas
to
saudi
arabia
and
increase
supplies
to
uae
qatar
has
continued
pumping
gas
to
uae
under
existing
deals
despite
the
boycott
undeterred
by
sanctions
announced
a
plan
on
july
to
produce
million
tonnes
of
lng
a
year
equivalent
to
a
third
of
current
global
supplies
in
the
next
five
to
seven
years
who
said
his
business
strategy
was
driven
by
commercial
factors
not
politics
said
the
boycott
meant
qatar
would
no
longer
consider
pipelines
for
gas
exports
basically
the
decision
was
if
this
is
what
they
are
doing
to
us
i
am
just
going
to
go
full
lng
and
never
think
of
pipeline
supplies
in
the
future
said
he
added
that
if
things
go
back
to
normal
in
the
future
qatar
s
neighbours
could
buy
lng
rather
than
piped
gas
s
restructuring
of
qp
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
energy
firms
with
a
daily
output
of
million
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
had
also
put
the
company
on
a
better
footing
to
manage
the
challenge
of
the
boycott
although
the
initial
catalyst
for
corporate
changes
was
the
low
price
of
oil
crude
plunged
from
above
a
barrel
in
to
below
in
prompting
and
other
industry
executives
to
focus
on
cutting
costs
and
tightening
up
a
corporate
structures
that
had
expanded
in
the
oil
boom
years
my
vision
is
to
focus
on
our
core
business
and
get
out
of
anything
that
is
not
core
business
he
said
a
lot
of
people
talked
about
downsizing
i
was
trying
to
rightsize

qatar

had
been
formed
in
as
a
wholly
owned
foreign
investment
arm
and
tasweeq
its
marketing
arm
he
also
merged
two
lng
producers
qatargas
and
rasgas
said
qp
s
operating
costs
would
be
billion
qatar
riyals
billion
a
year
lower
due
to
the
restructuring
which
included
cutting
as
many
as
jobs
to
create
a
more
streamlined
operation
responding
to
the
boycott
qp
also
said
it
would
set
up
a
fuel
oil
bunkering
business
in
qatar
after
ships
heading
to
qatar
were
banned
from
using
the

qatar
shares

vision
to

remains
undimmed
