andeavor says it saves $100 mln in u.s. biofuel costs in 2016-17
new
york
may
reuters
andeavor
one
of
the
largest
refining
companies
has
reported
saving
million
over
the
past
two
years
due
to
lower
compliance
costs
related
to
the
renewable
fuel
standard
which
requires
refiners
to
mix
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
fuel
or
purchase
credits
from
rivals
that
do
the
company
s
announcement
late
on
monday
came
after
reuters
reported
last
month
that
the
environmental
protection
agency
had
granted
the
company
a
financial
hardship
waiver
that
freed
its
smallest
refining
facilities
from
the
regulation
the
biofuels
industry
has
accused
the
trump
administration
s
epa
of
undermining
demand
for
biofuels
by
improperly
granting
waivers
to
companies
like
andeavor
epa
has
rejected
that
charge
andeavor
said
in
its
earnings
statement
monday
that
it
saved
approximately
million
primarily
related
to
a
reduction
in
the
rins
obligation
for
the
and
compliance
periods
for
some
of
the
company
s
inland
andeavor
recorded
net
profits
of
billion
in
reuters
reported
that
andeavor
s
epa
hardship
exemptions
had
freed
andeavor
s
refineries
in
north
dakota
utah
and
new
mexico
from
having
to
blend
biofuels
or
buy
rins
for
the
compliance
period
the
report
did
not
mention
any
waivers
for
the
company
did
not
explicitly
credit
small
refinery
exemptions
for
the
savings
a
company
official
did
not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for
comment
the
epa
said
it
has
granted
more
than
two
dozen
hardship
exemptions
in
recent
months
to
small
refineries
that
say
compliance
would
have
been
too
financially
difficult
this
was
a
major
expansion
of
the
program
this
was
a
major
expansion
for
waivers
since
the
epa
began
issuing
discretionary
exemptions
in
the
epa
has
tended
to
give
out
less
than
such
waivers
a
year
according
to
former
officials
the
epa
has
said
its
criteria
for
granting
the
waivers
has
not
changed
and
that
applications
are
considered
on
a
case
by
case
basis
the
expansion
of
the
small
refinery
waiver
program
is
due
in
part
to
a
federal
court
decision
last
year
that
said
the
epa
had
been
too
stingy
with
the
exemptions
in
the
past
but
biofuel
groups
say
the
epa
has
gone
beyond
the
court
mandate
and
is
using
the
cover
of
the
court
to
gut
