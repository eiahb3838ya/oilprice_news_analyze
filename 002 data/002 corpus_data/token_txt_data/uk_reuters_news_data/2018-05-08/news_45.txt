moscow

reuters
russia
has
exported
less
crude
oil
to
europe
this
year
as
the
quality
of
the
fuel
on
offer
deteriorated
and
tense
diplomatic
relations
prompted
it
to
redirect
more
volumes
to
china
russia
increased
oil
pipeline
exports
to
china
by
almost
percent
in
from
a
year
earlier
to
million
tonnes
igor
dyomin
a
spokesman
for
transneft
russia
s
oil
pipeline
monopoly
said
on
tuesday
moscow
has
embarked
on
a
pivot
east
strategy
and
tried
to
boost
ties
with
asia
as
its
relations
with
the
west
have
chilled
over
russia
s
role
in
ukraine
s
conflict
and
its
alleged
meddling
in
the
presidential
election
in
the
increase
in
oil
supplies
to
china
has
resulted
in
a
worsening
quality
of
urals
blend
including
an
increase
of
unwanted
sulphur
content
dyomin
said
that
hungary
slovakia
and
poland
cut
russian
oil
imports
by
around
percent
in
and
shipments
to
europe
via
the
two
branches
of
the
druzhba
pipeline
declined
by
tonnes
to
million
tonnes
in
the
first
fourth
months
of
the
year
the
decrease
in
purchasing
volumes
happened
as
the
countries
want
to
get
oil
with
sulphur
content
of
percent
though
the
sulphur
content
is
capped
at
percent
in
the
contract
dyomin
said
adding
the
figure
stands
at
percent
now
according
to
reuters
calculation
the
sulphur
content
in
urals
as
of
february
had
increased
on
average
by
percent
from
there
are
no
legal
consequences
for
urals
quality
falling
below
the
standards
but
it
has
dampened
its
price
and
prompted
buyers
to
think
about
the
possibility
of
reducing
the
volumes
they
buy
according
to
traders
and
sources
close
to
european
refineries
