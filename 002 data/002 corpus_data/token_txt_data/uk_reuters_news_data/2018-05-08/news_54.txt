german experts advise against forced retrofits for diesel cars
frankfurt
reuters
german
carmakers
can
not
be
forced
to
retrofit
polluting
diesel
cars
unless
excessive
pollution
is
caused
by
deliberate
fraud
an
expert
report
being
reviewed
by
germany
s
transport
ministry
showed
on
tuesday
the
expert
opinion
supports
germany
s
current
stance
of
relying
on
software
upgrades
rather
than
compulsory
rebuilds
of
exhaust
management
systems
on
cars
with
high
pollution
levels
so
far
no
manufacturer
other
than
volkswagen
has
admitted
to
using
software
to
recognise
when
a
car
is
being
put
through
an
emissions
test
cycle
in
order
to
deliberately
mask
pollution
levels
under
normal
driving
conditions
a
regulatory
on
toxic
emissions
has
however
revealed
several
carmakers
often
exceed
pollution
limits
because
they
make
use
of
a
thermal
window
to
legally
throttle
back
emissions
filtering
systems
to
protect
engines
from
condensation
german
environmental
groups
argue
upgrades
to
exhaust
systems
on
polluting
cars
should
be
made
compulsory
but
transport
minister
andreas
scheuer
has
said
software
updates
to
improve
the
effectiveness
of
filtering
systems
is
sufficient
the
expert
group
was
divided
on
the
cost
and
merit
of
retrofits
retrofitting
diesel
cars
would
cost
at
least
euro
pounds
per
vehicle
for
cars
with
engines
and
the
environmental
benefits
would
only
become
effective
in
three
to
four
years
some
members
said
others
calculated
retrofits
would
cost
only
about
euros
and
recommended
them
as
a
viable
solution
a
federal
court
ruled
in
february
that
german
cities
could
ban
the
most
heavily
polluting
diesel
cars
from
their
streets
chancellor
angela
merkel
wants
to
avoid
such
bans
calling
instead
for
tailored
solutions
to
bring
down
car
emissions
in
heavily
polluted
cities
the
states
of
bavaria
and
also
lower
saxony
home
to
germany
s
biggest
car
manufacturers
want
to
introduce
incentives
or
tax
breaks
to
encourage
car
owners
to
retrofit
vehicles
lower
saxony
home
to
volkswagen
europe
s
biggest
carmaker
suggested
vehicle
owners
should
receive
up
to
euros
in
incentives
and
tax
breaks
to
fund
retrofits
the
cost
of
which
should
be
borne
by
manufacturers
and
the
federal
government
germany
s
finance
ministry
has
shown
no
willingness
to
subsidise
such
incentives
the
german
car
industry
which
accounts
for
some
jobs
in
europe
s
biggest
economy
is
struggling
with
a
global
backlash
against
diesel
cars
after
volkswagen
admitted
in
that
it
had
cheated
diesel
exhaust
tests
on
tuesday
germany
s
transport
ministry
said
audi
a
premium
brand
owned
by
volkswagen
faced
another
investigation
of
vehicles
suspected
of
being
fitted
with
illegal
