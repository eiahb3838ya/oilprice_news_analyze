german energy regulator says new renewable targets create grid challenges

germany
must
build
new
power
transmission
lines
if
it
wants
to
nearly
double
its
renewable
energy
share
by
a
challenge
given
that
grid
expansion
is
already
behind
target
the
head
of
the
federal
network
regulator
said
on
tuesday
there
is
a
simple
correlation
the
more
volatile
renewables
there
are
the
more
the
grids
will
have
to
be
expanded
said
jochen
homann
president
of
the
bundesnetzagentur
responsible
for
keeping
the
lights
on
in
europe
s
biggest
economy
germany
aims
to
raise
wind
and
solar
power
s
energy
share
from
a
third
now
to
percent
by
to
help
cut
carbon
dioxide
emissions
and
achieve
its
climate
commitments
in
line
with
the
wishes
of
the
new
coalition
government
before
these
goals
were
set
the
bundesnetzagentur
or
federal
network
agency
had
made
plans
based
on
a
renewable
share
of
percent
by
homann
told
a
news
conference
now
we
re
dealing
with
significantly
more
he
said
germany
is
set
to
quit
nuclear
power
by
losing
megawatts
mw
of
reliable
capacity
between
and
then
while
germany
s
renewable
power
capacity
of
around
mw
can
theoretically
meet
percent
of
demand
under
favourable
weather
conditions
the
problem
is
that
if
the
weather
turns
there
can
be
next
to
no
green
power
bundesnetzagentur
data
show
that
of
some
kms
miles
of
additional
grids
and
power
line
improvements
planned
to
accommodate
the
rise
of
renewable
installations
in
the
next
decade
only
km
have
been
approved
and
km
have
been
implemented
the
picture
for
plans
up
to
is
a
bit
more
favourable
power
network
operators
overseen
by
the
authority
expect
that
around
percent
of
the
km
of
new
lines
due
to
be
completed
by
that
date
can
be
achieved
even
if
digitalisation
meant
that
existing
networks
could
be
better
tapped
as
unused
resources
could
be
better
allocated
this
must
not
come
at
the
expense
of
security
homann
said
transmission
grid
firms
dependent
on
weather
patterns
reduce
or
add
power
capacity
to
grids
to
keep
supply
stable
costs
for
such
measures
have
been
exploding
due
to
the
volatile
nature
of
renewables
posing
a
burden
for
consumers
who
share
these
as
part
of
their
final
bills
last
year
should
have
seen
another
rise
to
above
billion
euros
million
pounds
in
these
costs
after
was
below
and
those
in
above
that
figure
homann
said
to
ensure
grid
stability
next
winter
the
authority
said
last
week
it
foresees
network
reserve
needs
of
mw
well
down
from
mw
in
the
winter
just
past
this
is
because
germany
s
and
austria
s
power
market
zones
will
be
split
from
october
allowing
for
lower
costs
and
fewer
technical
risks
in
power
flows
