u.s. treasury's mnuchin does not see iran sanctions hiking oil prices
washington

reuters
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
on
tuesday
he
does
not
anticipate
major
oil
price
hikes
after
renewed
sanctions
hit
iranian
production
because
some
countries
are
willing
to
increase
output
to
offset
such
losses
mnuchin
speaking
to
reporters
at
a
news
briefing
declined
to
identify
countries
which
may
add
output
saying
there
had
been
conversations
with
different
parties
that
would
be
willing
to
increase
oil
supply
to
offset
this
so
my
expectation
is
not
that
oil
prices
will
go
higher
to
a
certain
extent
some
of
this
was
already
in
the
market
on
oil
mnuchin
said
that
licenses
for
boeing
co
and
airbus
to
sell
aircraft
and
components
to
iran
will
be
revoked
as
a
result
of
the
reimposed
sanctions
on
tehran
under
the
original
deal
there
were
waivers
for
commercial
aircraft
parts
and
services
and
the
existing
licenses
will
be
revoked
mnuchin
