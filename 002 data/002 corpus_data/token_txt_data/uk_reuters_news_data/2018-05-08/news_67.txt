graphic-could u.s. sanctions hit iranian crude exports?
london
may
reuters
oil
prices
are
at
more
than
highs
driven
by
an
expectation
that
renewed
sanctions
on
tehran
over
the
country
s
nuclear
programme
will
disrupt
iranian
crude
flows
but
without
the
europe
union
or
iran
s
other
big
crude
customers
joining
the
effort
as
the
eu
did
in
it
will
be
harder
for
washington
to
hit
iran
where
it
really
hurts
president
donald
trump
has
given
britain
france
and
germany
a
may
deadline
to
fix
what
he
views
as
the
flaws
of
the
nuclear
deal
or
he
will
reimpose
sanctions
trump
has
all
but
decided
to
withdraw
from
the
agreement
sources
said
though
exactly
how
he
will
do
so
remains
unclear
europe
now
buys
close
to
a
quarter
of
all
iranian
oil
exports
yet
it
is
still
the
asian
heavyweights
china
india
korea
and
japan
that
take
the
bulk
of
the
shipments
turkey
is
iran
s
other
major
buyer
and
flows
there
have
nearly
trebled
since
january
rising
by
bpd
since
january
iran
s
crude
output
has
risen
by
around
a
quarter
or
bpd
to
million
bpd
making
it
the
sixth
largest
oil
producer
in
the
world
exports
meanwhile
have
more
than
doubled
to
record
highs
of
million
bpd
this
april
up
around
million
bpd
in
the
same
time
most
of
which
has
been
driven
by
shipments
to
refineries
in
the
european
union
france
italy
spain
and
greece
are
iran
s
biggest
eu
customers
and
europe
s
share
of
the
pie
is
a
full
bpd
larger
now
than
it
was
in
early
over
the
three
years
of
record
global
surplus
of
oil
and
refined
products
and
prices
iran
has
learned
to
do
more
with
less
according
to
the
imf
iran
will
need
an
average
oil
price
of
a
barrel
in
to
balance
its
budget
