said
the

the

iran

for
about

trump
announced
everything
that
one
could
possibly
have
wanted
him
to
say
said
eric
nuttall
partner
and
senior
portfolio
manager
at
ninepoint
partners
in
toronto
it
gives
one
confidence
that
there
could
be
a
reduction
in
the
physical
movement
of
barrels
and
this
also
puts
at
stake
the
medium
and
growth
ambitions
of
iran
to
grow
their
production
and
oil
prices
had
been
supported
over
the
past
month
by
expectations
that
trump
would
pull
out
of
the
deal
which
could
hit
iranian
crude
exports
and
feed
geopolitical
tensions
in
the
middle
east
home
to
a
third
of
the
world
s
daily
oil
supply
since
the
exemption
from

came
into

iran

have
risen
to
about
million
bpd
from
less
than
million
bpd
goldman
sachs
said
in
a
note
that
it
was
unclear
if
million
bpd
in
exports
would
be
at
risk
as
it
was
from
to
a
majority
of
the
country
s
exports
currently
go
to
asia
with
europe
receiving
about
bpd
earlier
in
the
session
prices
plunged
as
media
reports
rattled
markets
with
doubts
about
whether
trump
would
withdraw

the

as
most

rose

changing

its

trading
day
since
the

was
struck
on
more

lots

the
highest
since
early
february
during
the

fell
as
much
as

hitting
a

touched
a

trump
s
announcement
had
been
baked
into
the
cake
in
recent
days
hence
we
saw
prices
selling
off
today
given
the
air
of
certainty
surrounding
it
said
matt
smith
director
of

research
at

that
said
the
tough
stance
taken
has
helped

limit
iran
s
nuclear
program

known
as
the
joint

the
united

agreed
to

on

and
has
done
so
under
a
string
of
waivers
that
effectively

market
participants
said
oil
was
also
pressured
by
strength
in
the
dollar
which
advanced
to
its
highest
level

a
basket
of
currencies
on

if
the

to
rally

regardless
of
what
trump
does
with
this
iran
deal
any
gains
for
oil
are
going
to
be
as
the
greatest

here
is
the
risk
of
