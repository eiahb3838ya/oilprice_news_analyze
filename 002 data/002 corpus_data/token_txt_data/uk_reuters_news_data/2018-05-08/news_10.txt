president
donald
trump
told
a
group
of
senators
on
tuesday
he
is
considering
allowing
exported
ethanol
to
count
toward
the
volumes
mandated
under
the
nation
s
biofuels
law
a
move
intended
to
appease
both
big
oil
and
big
corn
by
cutting
the
refiners
regulatory
costs
while
preserving
demand
for
corn
according
to
two
sources
briefed
on
trump
s
meeting
with
the
republican
senators
trump
also
reiterated
his
support
for
expanding
sales
of
higher
ethanol
blends
of
gasoline
and
backed
away
from
a
proposal
to
cap
the
price
of
credits
called
rins
that
refiners
must
acquire
and
turn
into
the
government
each
year
to
prove
compliance
with
the
biofuels
quotas
the
proposed
changes
follow
months
of
fractious
negotiations
between
big
corn
and
big
oil
over
the
future
of
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
that
requires
biofuels
to
be
added
to
gasoline
and
diesel
after
refiners
increasingly
complained
the
regulation
was
costing
them
a
fortune
the
ethanol
industry
criticized
the
export
plan
offering
rin
credits
which
are
supposed
to
be
derived
from
a
domestic
renewable
fuel
use
for
ethanol
exports
would
threaten
trade
markets
and
impact
corn
farmers
economic
livelihoods
said
kevin
skunes
president
of
the
national
corn
growers
association
republican
senator
ted
cruz
of
texas
who
attended
the
meeting
declared
the
plan
a
victory
for
both
the
refining
industry
and
for
corn
growers
more
corn
will
be
sold
good
for
farmers
plus
lower
rins
saves
refinery
jobs
plus
more
ethanol
exports
good
for
america

republican
senator
chuck
grassley
of
iowa
who
also
attended
the
meeting
applauded
the
move
to
expand
the
use
of
higher
ethanol
blends
of
gasoline
but
expressed
caution
over
the
export
plan
devil
in
details
he
wrote
republicans
joni
ernst
of
iowa
and
pat
toomey
of
pennsylvania
also
attended
the
meeting
sources
said
the
export
plan
emerged
from
discussions
on
tuesday
about
the
trump
administration
s
expanded
use
of
hardship
waivers
that
free
small
refineries
from
their
obligations
under
the
rfs
industry
experts
say
the
waivers
provided
by
trump
s
epa
have
taken
a
big
chunk
out
the
billion
ethanol
credit
market
senators
concerned
about
the
use
of
waivers
wanted
to
know
how
the
administration
planned
on
making
up
or
reallocating
the
lost
credits
and
the
plan
to
attach
rins
to
exports
was
offered
as
a
solution
the
sources
said
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
and
epa
head
scott
pruitt
are
expected
to
work
out
the
details
on
the
export
plan
a
proposal
to
allow
exported
ethanol
and
other
biofuels
to
generate
the
tradable
rins
credits
under
the
rfs
was
floated
by
the
trump
administration
last
year
to
help
lower
rin
costs
to
refiners
but
was
quickly
shot
down
by
the
powerful
corn
lobby
the
oil
industry
meanwhile
has
also
expressed
opposition
to
expanding
the
sale
of
gasoline
containing
percent
ethanol
known
as
mainly
on
the
grounds
that
it
cuts
into
petroleum
s
share
of
the
fuel
market
the
rfs
is
intended
to
help
farmers
reduce
air
pollution
and
cut
petroleum
imports
but
some
merchant
refiners
like
pbf
energy
and
valero
energy
corp
say
it
costs
them
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
annually
the
trump
administration
waded
into
the
issue
late
last
year
after
fielding
complaints
from
the
refining
sector
and
hosted
a
series
of
meetings
with
lawmakers
and
company
executives
representing
both
sides
both
the
corn
lobby
and
the
merchant
refining
industry
have
said
a
misstep
could
threaten
the
same
jobs
trump
has
vowed
to
support
but
pressure
to
rein
in
regulatory
costs
has
also
softened
in
recent
weeks
as
the
price
of
compliance
credits
have
hit
lows
of
around
cents
those
declines
were
driven
mainly
by
news
the
epa
had
granted
more
than
two
dozen
hardship
exemptions
from
the
rfs
to
small
refineries
that
say
compliance
would
have
been
too
financially
difficult
in
the
past
the
epa
has
tended
to
give
out
less
than
ten
such
waivers
annually
according
to
former
officials
the
expansion
of
the
small
refinery
waiver
program
is
due
in
part
to
a
federal
court
decision
last
year
that
said
the
epa
had
been
too
stingy
with
the
exemptions
in
the
past
but
biofuel
groups
say
the
epa
is
using
the
cover
of
the
court
to
gut
the
rfs
