it
said
on

dealing
a
fresh
setback
to
parent
volkswagen
more
than
years
after
it
first
admitted
to
cheating
diesel
exhaust
tests
audi
said
it
had
stopped
deliveries
of
and
models
with
a
certain
type
of
diesel
engine
after
finding
a
previously
unidentified
problem
with
emissions
software
it
did
not
give
details
of
the
problem
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
said
cars
would
have
to
be
recalled
for
a
software
update
taking
the
total
number
of
vehicles
with
audi
engines
to
be
recalled
over
the
dieselgate
emissions
scandal
to
more
than
volkswagen
vw
has
recalled
millions
of
vehicles
in
total
and
paid
out
billions
of
dollars
in
fines
since
it
admitted
in
september
to
using
illegal
defeat
device
software
that
masked
the
level
of
pollution
emitted
by
its
diesel
engines
having
announced
a
investment
in
electric
vehicles
and
a
new
chief
executive
only
last
month
europe
s
largest
carmaker
has
been
looking
to
move
on
from
the
biggest
business
crisis
in
its
history
audi
s
announcement
came
a
day
before
its
annual
shareholder
meeting
where
it
was
hoping
to
focus
on
its
electric
car
plans
the
german
transport
ministry
said
earlier
on
tuesday
that
the
kba
motor
vehicle
authority
had
summoned
audi
for
a
formal
hearing
about
its
diesel
models
the
kba
has
requested
a
hearing
on
suspicion
the
audi
models
have
been
fitted
with
an
illegal
defeat
device
the
ministry
said
in
a
statement
german
magazine
der
spiegel
was
first
to
report
that
audi
had
discovered
the
problem
prosecutors
in
munich
which
in
the
past
have
raided
audi
s
headquarters
and
are
investigating
of
its
current
and
former
employees
said
on
tuesday
they
would
widen
their
probe
to
include
the
affected
models
however
evercore
isi
analyst
arndt
ellinghorst
did
not
see
a
big
financial
impact
from
the
latest
setback
as
painful
annoying
and
incomprehensible
as
these
issues
are
they
will
unlikely
trigger
massive
incremental
legal
risks
best
guess
this
could
trigger
million
euros
in
additional
costs
which
should
be
covered
by
vw
s
existing
diesel
provisions
he
said
in
a
note
audi
said
it
had
informed
the
monitor
tasked
with
overseeing
vw
s
reforms
of
its
latest
problem
but
added
no
cars
in
the
united
states
were
affected
by
it
audi
said
in
november
two
months
after
the
admission
of
wrongdoing
by
vw
that
defeat
device
software
was
installed
in
about
cars
in
the
united
states
fitted
with
its
larger
engines
