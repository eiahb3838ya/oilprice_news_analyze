china
s
exports
rebounded
more
strongly
than
expected
in
april
after
a
surprise
drop
the
previous
month
suggesting
global
demand
remains
relatively
resilient
and
providing
a
cushion
to
the
economy
amid
a
heated
trade
dispute
with
the
united
states
imports
in
april
also
grew
more
robustly
than
anticipated
signalling
china
s
domestic
demand
is
holding
up
well
good
news
for
policymakers
looking
to
soften
the
blow
from
any
trade
shocks
china
s
april
exports
rose
percent
from
a
year
earlier
beating
analysts
forecasts
for
a
percent
increase
and
snapping
back
from
a
percent
drop
in
march
that
economists
believe
was
heavily
distorted
by
seasonal
factors
some
analysts
however
warned
the
strong
april
export
showing
was
mostly
seasonal
and
that
a
global
trade
recovery
may
have
topped
out
shipments
still
look
healthy
but
today
s
data
does
point
to
a
softening
in
external
demand
recently
capital
economics
senior
china
economist
julian
wrote
in
a
note
estimating
that
exports
by
volume
may
have
actually
slipped
on
a
basis
the
backdrop
of
the
ongoing
trade
negotiations
between
china
and
the
is
one
in
which
global
growth
has
already
peaked
and
china
s
export
performance
is
waning
as
a
still
china
has
outperformed
other
major
asian
economies
such
as
japan
and
south
korea
recently
suggesting
its
exporters
may
be
ramping
up
shipments
of
finished
goods
and
purchases
of
raw
materials
and
parts
in
case
of
supply
chain
disruptions
following
both
sides
tariff
threats
we
may
see
some
retreat
in
exports
in
the
following
months
said
betty
wang
senior
china
economist
at
anz
referring
to
the
risk
of
a
slowdown
after
a
burst
of
by
shippers
eager
to
beat
any
punitive
measures
export
growth
was
led
by
a
percent
increase
in
shipments
of
products
led
by
mobile
phones
imports
also
beat
expectations
growing
percent
beating
forecasts
of
percent
growth
and
accelerating
from
a
percent
rise
in
march
the
strong
readings
suggest
china
s
domestic
demand
remains
resilient
despite
rising
corporate
borrowing
costs
and
cooling
property
sales
the
two
risk
factors
most
commonly
cited
by
economists
who
are
expecting
a
slowdown
imports
were
drive
by
china
s
continued
appetite
for
resources
and
agricultural
commodities
but
also
by
products
especially
electronic
integrated
circuits
which
have
surged
percent
since
the
start
of
the
year
the
tech
buying
binge
comes
as
china
s
strategic
industrial
policies
come
under
increased
global
scrutiny
due
to
complaints
about
forced
technology
transfer
and
intellectual
property
theft
with
integrated
circuits
or
chips
an
especially
sensitive
area
china
imported
billion
billion
pounds
of
chips
in
the
first
four
months
of
the
year
accounting
for
nearly
percent
of
total
imports
and
possibly
pointing
to
solid
growth
in
electronics
exports
for
at
least
a
few
more
months
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
have
threatened
each
other
with
tariffs
on
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
exports
in
recent
months
leading
to
worries
that
washington
and
beijing
may
plunge
into
a
trade
war
that
could
damage
global
growth
and
destabilise
financial
markets
while
economists
still
believe
a
compromise
can
be
reached
and
the
scenario
avoided
the
risk
of
disruptions
in
trade
and
investment
have
added
to
existing
concerns
about
an
economic
slowdown
in
china
this
year
discussions
between
the
two
sides
in
beijing
last
week
appeared
to
make
little
substantive
progress
in
defusing
trade
tensions
apart
from
an
agreement
to
hold
more
talks
china
s
top
economic
official
will
visit
washington
next
week
to
resume
trade
talks
with
the
trump
administration
the
white
house
said
on
monday
the
trump
administration
has
drawn
a
hard
line
demanding
a
billion
cut
in
the
chinese
trade
surplus
with
the
united
states
by
sharply
lower
tariffs
and
advanced
technology
subsidies
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
talks
last
friday
president
xi
jinping
pledged
recently
to
increase
imports
in
comments
that
were
seen
as
a
bid
to
defuse
tensions
with
the
united
states
and
other
trading
partners
but
highlighting
the
challenge
of
reducing
that
gap
any
time
soon
china
s
trade
surplus
with
the
united
states
widened
to
billion
in
april
from
billion
in
march
according
to
reuters
calculations
based
on
customs
data
released
on
tuesday
for
it
rose
to
billion
from
about
billion
in
the
same
period
last
year
china
s
exports
to
the
united
states
rose
percent
in
april
from
a
year
earlier
slowing
from
a
percent
rise
in
the
first
quarter
its
imports
from
the
rose
percent
in
april
the
fastest
growth
in
three
months
china
posted
a
total
trade
surplus
of
billion
for
the
month
compared
with
forecasts
for
a
billion
surplus
in
april
and
a
rare
deficit
of
billion
in
march
while
neither
the
united
states
nor
china
has
set
a
hard
time
frame
for
imposition
of
tariffs
the
threat
of
disruptions
and
higher
costs
may
already
be
altering
global
trade
patterns
as
well
as
companies
production
and
marketing
strategies
companies
in
both
countries
have
said
that
they
are
adjusting
business
plans
and
becoming
more
cautious
in
the
face
of
the
worsening
trade
environment
and
the
threat
of
more
tariffs
china
s
global
exports
of
steel
and
aluminium
a
major
point
of
contention
with
washington
and
other
countries
both
rose
in
april
as
tariffs
and
sanctions
caused
a
spike
in
global
prices
prompting
mills
and
smelters
to
send
more
metal
abroad
