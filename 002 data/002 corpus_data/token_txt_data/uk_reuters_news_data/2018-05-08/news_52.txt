update 3-'upswing remains intact': german industrial data dispels concerns
berlin
reuters
a
rebound
in
german
industrial
output
in
march
and
an
increase
in
exports
in
the
same
month
helped
to
ease
concern
on
tuesday
that
growth
in
europe
s
biggest
economy
had
come
to
a
standstill
at
the
start
of
the
year
the
federal
statistics
office
said
industrial
production
rose
percent
on
the
month
the
strongest
increase
since
november
and
above
expectations
for
a
percent
rise
the
upswing
remains
intact
the
economy
ministry
said
the
government
expects
growth
of
percent
this
year
up
from
percent
in
seasonally
adjusted
exports
rose
percent
while
imports
fell
percent
widening
germany
s
trade
surplus
to
billion
euros
billion
pounds
in
march
the
data
showed
german
companies
continue
to
do
well
on
international
markets
said
holger
bingmann
head
of
the
bga
trade
body
in
the
first
quarter
exports
rose
nearly
percent
on
the
year
he
said
adding
trade
is
still
driving
the
german
president
donald
trump
has
repeatedly
criticised
germany
s
export
strength
arguing
that
import
tariffs
would
protect
american
manufacturing
jobs
and
reduce
the
trade
deficit
with
germany
and
other
eu
countries
the
bullish
output
and
export
figures
brought
some
relief
after
weak
data
for
january
and
february
pointed
to
a
massive
slowdown
in
the
first
quarter
rebounding
exports
and
industrial
production
show
that
talk
of
a
downswing
has
been
premature
ing
bank
economist
carsten
brzeski
said
but
given
the
first
two
disappointing
months
data
on
overall
gross
domestic
product
growth
in
the
first
quarter
due
next
week
are
likely
to
come
in
weaker
than
the
percent
registered
in
the
final
three
months
of
unicredit
economist
andreas
rees
said
the
data
pointed
to
a
quarterly
growth
rate
of
up
to
percent
maybe
this
is
just
a
blip
in
the
first
quarter
but
this
weaker
performance
could
also
continue
in
spring
rees
added
the
outlook
for
german
exporters
has
clouded
as
factories
face
rising
protectionism
and
a
stronger
euro
this
was
also
reflected
in
data
on
monday
which
showed
factory
orders
dropped
for
a
third
month
running
in
march
as
foreign
demand
weakened
a
string
of
unexpectedly
weak
economic
data
had
pointed
to
a
cooling
in
the
euro
zone
economy
as
a
whole
possibly
making
it
more
difficult
for
the
european
central
bank
to
begin
scaling
back
its
unprecedented
monetary
stimulus
later
this
year
in
the
full
first
quarter
german
industrial
output
edged
up
percent
on
the
quarter
the
economy
ministry
said
after
the
strong
performance
in
the
course
of
production
in
manufacturing
took
a
breather
in
the
first
quarter
the
ministry
said
the
ministry
blamed
the
slow
start
to
the
year
on
a
flu
epidemic
an
unusually
high
number
of
strikes
and
an
number
of
holidays
over
easter
falling
in
march
after
a
calm
phase
industrial
output
will
gain
momentum
in
the
course
of
the
year
the
ministry
said
pointing
to
full
order
books
and
favourable
economic
conditions
for
trade
the
diw
economic
institute
has
said
it
expected
economic
growth
to
slow
to
percent
in
the
first
quarter
and
bounce
back
to
around
percent
in
the
second
ing
s
brzeski
agreed
there
was
little
reason
to
doubt
the
underlying
strength
of
germany
s
current
upswing
which
is
now
in
its
ninth
year
the
biggest
domestic
problem
for
the
german
economy
is
that
factories
are
struggling
to
increase
production
he
said
pointing
to
record
employment
and
widespread
labour
shortages
as
well
as
filled
order
books
and
capacity
constraints
against
this
background
more
investment
seems
to
be
the
best
and
easiest
way
forward
it
would
increase
production
capacity
and
could
lift
the
current
speed
limits
he
added
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
coalition
government
has
promised
to
invest
billions
of
euros
in
digital
infrastructure
education
and
social
housing
in
the
coming
four
years
finance
minister
olaf
scholz
from
the
social
democrats
will
present
the
government
s
updated
tax
estimates
on
wednesday
which
could
show
additional
room
for
fiscal
spending
