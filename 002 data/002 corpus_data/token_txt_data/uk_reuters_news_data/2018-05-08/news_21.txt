total's iran gas deal hangs by a thread after trump dumps nuclear deal
paris
reuters
president
donald
trump
s
decision
on
tuesday
to
pull
out
of
the
iran
nuclear
accord
and
reinstate
tough
economic
sanctions
could
scupper
french
oil
major
total
s
gas
project
in
the
country
unless
it
can
secure
a
waiver
total
signed
a
deal
with
tehran
in
july
to
develop
phase
of
iran
s
south
pars
field
with
an
initial
investment
of
billion
million
pounds
marking
the
first
major
western
energy
investment
in
the
islamic
republic
since
the
lifting
of
sanctions
however
trump
described
the
nuclear
agreement
that
made
such
an
investment
possible
as
horribly
and
said
iran
had
used
proceeds
from
the
lifting
of
sanctions
in
to
build
missiles
support
terrorism
and
cause
havoc
across
the
middle
east
and
beyond
he
said
he
would
be
instituting
the
highest
level
of
economic
sanctions
against
tehran
raising
questions
over
the
viability
of
investments
made
in
iran
by
foreign
companies
with
a
footprint
any
nation
that
helps
iran
for
their
quest
for
nuclear
weapons
could
also
be
strongly
sanctioned
by
the
united
states
trump
said
total
buys
iranian
crude
for
its
european
refineries
carries
out
transactions
in
dollars
and
billions
of
dollars
in
investments
including
its
port
arthur
refinery
company
officials
were
not
immediately
available
for
comment
total
expects
the
south
pars
project
part
of
the
world
s
largest
gas
field
to
have
production
capacity
of
billion
cubic
feet
per
day
or
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
including
condensate
to
supply
the
iranian
domestic
market
from
chief
executive
patrick
pouyanne
has
previously
said
that
one
option
open
to
the
company
if
trump
withdrew
from
the
iran
accord
and
imposed
new
sanctions
would
be
to
seek
a
waiver
allowing
it
to
continue
working
in
iran
if
the
sanctions
are
back
we
will
have
to
apply
for
specific
sanctions
waivers
pouyanne
told
journalists
on
the
sidelines
of
a
conference
on
april
total
has
history
of
success
in
such
moves
in
the
it
obtained
a
waiver
for
the
south
pars
and
projects
after
the
imposition
of
sanctions
at
the
time
it
argued
then
as
it
might
do
now
that
it
made
its
investment
at
a
time
sanctions
were
not
in
place
pouyanne
said
that
total
has
been
lobbying
the
french
government
and
other
european
capitals
to
obtain
such
a
waiver
again
and
protect
its
investments
in
iran
total
has
a
percent
stake
in
the
billion
south
pars
project
terms
of
the
partnership
show
it
is
committed
to
investing
an
initial
billion
to
get
the
project
off
the
ground
and
a
further
billion
to
develop
the
project
sources
say
it
has
already
spent
several
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
on
studies
and
tenders
china
s
cnpc
has
a
percent
stake
in
the
project
while
the
iran
s
national
oil
company
s
subsidiary
petropars
holds
the
remaining
percent
if
total
were
to
fail
in
an
eventual
attempt
to
obtain
a
waiver
the
company
is
expected
to
take
a
backseat
and
allow
cnpc
to
become
lead
operator
according
to
people
with
knowledge
of
the
deal
total
has
previously
expressed
its
commitment
to
iran
and
desire
to
press
ahead
with
the
project
as
long
as
it
can
find
a
way
to
continue
operating
legally
in
the
country
