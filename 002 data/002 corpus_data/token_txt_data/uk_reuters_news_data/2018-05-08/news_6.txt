saudi
arabia
indicated
on
wednesday
that
it
could
raise
its
oil
output
to
offset
any
potential
supply
shortage
as
a
result
of
new
sanctions
on
tehran
after
president
donald
trump
said
washington
was
withdrawing
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
oil
prices
had
been
supported
by
expectations
that
trump
would
pull
out
of
the
deal
which
could
hit
iranian
crude
exports
and
feed
geopolitical
tensions
in
the
middle
east

trump
said
on
tuesday
that
the
united
states
was
reimposing
the
highest
level
of
economic
sanctions
on
iran
but
he
did
not
provide
details
the
original
agreement
had
lifted
sanctions
in
exchange
for
tehran
limiting
its
nuclear
program
saudi
arabia
will
work
with
major
producers
and
consumers
within
and
outside
opec
to
limit
the
impact
of
any
supply
shortages
a
saudi
energy
ministry
official
said
on
wednesday
according
to
state
news
agency
spa
following
the
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
nuclear
agreement
with
iran
saudi
arabia
is
committed
to
supporting
the
stability
of
oil
markets
for
the
benefit
of
producers
and
consumers
and
the
sustainability
of
the
global
economic
growth
the
official
said
crude
settled
down
at
per
barrel
and
brent
settled
down
at
it
was
the
busiest
day
in
contracts
since
august
and
for
brent
the
busiest
in
almost
a
month
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
is
in
the
midst
of
an
oil
deal
with
producers
such
as
russia
that
has
helped
erase
a
global
glut
and
boosted
oil
prices
above
the
highest
since
opec
meets
next
in
june
where
it
is
widely
expected
to
continue
with
the
supply
cuts
until
the
end
of
but
a
drop
in
iranian
exports
due
to
a
return
of
sanctions
plus
involuntary
supply
losses
in
other
opec
members
such
as
venezuela
would
mean
the
supply
cut
would
be
significantly
larger
than
intended
that
raised
worries
of
a
quick
rise
in
oil
prices
iran
produces
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
and
the
country
is
opec
s
producer
behind
saudi
arabia
and
iraq
its
production
accounts
for
about
percent
of
the
world
s
oil
supplies
since
the
iran
nuclear
deal
went
into
effect
its
exports
have
risen
to
about
million
bpd
from
less
than
million
bpd
a
majority
goes
to
asia
with
europe
receiving
about
bpd

month

accused
opec
in
a
tweet
of
artificially
boosting
oil
prices
