new

may
reuters
president
donald
trump
is
expected
to
lay
out
his
plans
for
the
nation
s
biofuel
policy
on
tuesday
in
a
closed
door
briefing
with
senators
after
months
of
hearing
arguments
about
the
hotly
contested
regulation
according
to
two
sources
the
meeting
could
bring
to
an
end
a
tumultuous
several
months
of
talks
between
big
corn
and
big
oil
over
the
future
of
the
renewable
fuel
standard
discussions
that
were
mediated
by
the
white
house
and
intended
to
help
oil
refiners
cope
with
the
costs
of
the
regulation
the
white
house
is
saying
this
is
the
last
meeting
so
we
are
expecting
some
type
of
resolution
or
some
plan
going
forward
said
one
of
the
sources
republican
senators
chuck
grassley
and
joni
ernst
of
major
corn
growing
state
iowa
will
attend
the
meeting
along
with
republican
senators
ted
cruz
of
texas
and
pat
toomey
of
pennsylvania
whose
constituents
include
big
oil
refining
companies
the
sources
said
on
monday
asking
not
to
be
named
the
rfs
requires
refining
companies
to
mix
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
fuel
each
year
or
purchase
credits
from
companies
that
do
the
policy
is
intended
to
help
farmers
and
cut
petroleum
imports
but
some
merchant
refiners
like
pbf
energy
and
valero
energy
corp
say
it
costs
them
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
annually
the
trump
administration
waded
into
the
issue
late
last
year
after
fielding
complaints
from
the
refining
sector
and
hosted
a
series
of
meetings
with
lawmakers
and
company
executives
representing
both
sides
but
the
talks
ended
in
dispute
with
both
sides
complaining
that
they
were
not
getting
what
they
wanted
at
one
point
trump
threw
his
support
behind
a
proposal
from
cruz
to
cap
compliance
credits
at
cents
apiece
a
fraction
of
the
current
level
to
reduce
refiner
costs
but
the
administration
backed
off
the
idea
after
corn
states
said
it
would
weaken
the
incentive
to
blend
biofuels
trump
had
also
said
he
supports
the
idea
of
expanding
sales
of
higher
ethanol
blends
of
gasoline
a
concession
to
the
corn
industry
but
a
drawback
for
the
oil
industry
which
complains
it
would
reduce
petroleum
s
share
of
the
fuel
market
the
sources
familiar
with
tuesday
s
meeting
said
they
did
not
know
what
if
any
new
ideas
trump
might
propose
both
the
corn
lobby
and
the
merchant
refining
industry
say
a
misstep
could
threaten
the
same
jobs
trump
has
vowed
to
support
but
pressure
to
rein
in
regulatory
costs
has
also
softened
in
recent
weeks
as
the
price
of
compliance
credits
have
hit
lows
of
around
cents
those
declines
were
driven
mainly
by
news
the
environmental
protection
agency
had
granted
more
than
two
dozen
hardship
exemptions
from
the
rfs
to
small
refineries
that
say
compliance
would
have
been
too
financially
difficult
in
the
past
the
epa
has
tended
to
give
out
less
than
ten
such
waivers
annually
according
to
former
officials
the
expansion
of
the
small
refinery
waiver
program
is
due
in
part
to
a
federal
court
decision
last
year
that
said
the
epa
had
been
too
stingy
with
the
exemptions
in
the
past
but
biofuel
groups
say
the
epa
is
using
the
cover
of
the
court
to
gut
the
rfs
