update 2-sunpower loss narrows, sees $55 mln 2018 tariff impact
reuters
solar
company
sunpower
corp
reported
a
quarterly
loss
on
tuesday
on
higher
demand
for
solar
panels
in
its
residential
and
commercial
business
but
shares
fell
percent
in
extended
trade
when
the
company
said
tariffs
on
solar
imports
would
reduce
a
key
earnings
metric
by
million
this
year
sunpower
is
refocusing
its
business
on
distributed
generation
dg
or
projects
that
generate
power
for
homes
and
businesses
that
market
is
expected
to
increase
about
percent
over
the
next
five
years
sunpower
said
compared
with
flat
growth
for
power
plants
sunpower
s
premium
panels
are
to
the
dg
market
the
company
said
because
they
can
generate
more
power
in
smaller
spaces
than
rival
products
the
san
jose
company
makes
its
solar
products
primarily
in
the
philippines
and
mexico
and
opposed
the
trump
administration
s
percent
tariffs
on
imported
panels
last
month
the
company
said
it
would
buy
panel
maker
solarworld
americas
expanding
its
domestic
manufacturing
to
stem
the
impact
of
the
tariffs
on
tuesday
sunpower
chief
executive
tom
werner
declined
to
disclose
the
purchase
price
but
said
it
was
not
material
to
the
company
s
financials
sunpower
will
be
able
to
expand
upon
the
jobs
at
solarworld
s
hillsboro
oregon
factory
if
it
receives
a
tariff
exemption
on
some
of
its
solar
products
werner
said
in
an
interview
it
requested
an
exclusion
from
the
trade
representative
which
has
not
yet
made
a
decision
there
could
be
substantially
more
employment
without
a
tariff
werner
said
there
is
virtually
no
way
sunpower
can
expand
that
facility
and
pay
sunpower
said
it
expects
a
net
loss
of
million
to
million
in
the
second
quarter
it
also
forecast
adjusted
earnings
before
interest
taxes
depreciation
and
amortization
to
be
between
million
and
million
including
an
estimated
million
impact
from
the
tariffs
sunpower

net
loss
attributable
to
shareholders
narrowed
to
million
or

in
the

of

a

earlier
