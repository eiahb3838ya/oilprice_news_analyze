rise
in

before

to
million
on
a
quarterly
basis
ebitda
fell

as
higher

board
on

recommended
dividends
of
roubles

amounts
to
approximately

flow
for
the
period
the
company
said
dividends
are
stronger
than
expected
but
lower
versus

they
will
not
be
a

said
looking
ahead
to
the
next
quarter
mmk
said
it
expected
healthy
domestic
demand
but
sales
could
be
restrained
by
scheduled
equipment
maintenance
the
company
s
financial
performance
will
be
driven
by
higher
prices
for
steel
on
the
domestic
market
amid
the
seasonal
recovery
in
demand
and
devaluation
of
the
rouble
along
with
correction
in
prices
for
key
raw
materials
