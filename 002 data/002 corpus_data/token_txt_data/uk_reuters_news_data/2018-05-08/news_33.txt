california
regulators
said
reduced
capacity
in
southern
california
gas
socalgas
natural
gas
system
poses
a
moderate
threat
to
gas
and
electric
reliability
this
summer
and
a
more
serious
threat
next
winter
the
socalgas
system
has
been
operating
at
less
than
full
capacity
because
of
pipeline
outages
and
restrictions
on
the
use
of
the
aliso
canyon
gas
storage
facility
the
utility
s
biggest
following
a
leak
between
october
and
february
the
potential
for
additional
pipeline
outages
means
that
the
situation
may
be
getting
worse
not
better
the
aliso
canyon
technical
assessment
group
said
in
a
report
released
monday
noting
socalgas
avoided
serious
problems
last
winter
due
to
unusually
warm
weather
with
so
many
pipeline
outages
it
will
be
difficult
for
socalgas
to
fill
storage
to
a
level
sufficient
to
ensure
energy
reliability
throughout
the
coming
winter
the
group
made
up
of
state
regulators
and
regional
power
companies
said
officials
at
socalgas
a
unit
of
california
energy
company
sempra
energy
could
not
immediately
comment
on
the
report
to
avoid
power
and
gas
interruptions
this
summer
and
next
winter
the
group
recommended
socalgas
import
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
from
costa
azul
in
mexico
and
that
state
regulators
allow
the
utility
to
boost
the
capacity
and
use
of
aliso
canyon
the
state
has
limited
the
amount
of
gas
socalgas
can
inject
into
the
cubic
feet
bcf
aliso
canyon
to
just
bcf
and
only
allows
the
utility
to
pull
gas
from
the
field
when
other
options
are
not
available
to
meet
demand
one
billion
cubic
feet
is
enough
to
fuel
about
five
million
homes
for
a
day
the
report
said
this
summer
s
challenges
stem
primarily
from
continuing
outages
and
reductions
on
key
pipelines
including
lines
and
and
the
technical
group
projected
capacity
on
socalgas
system
would
total
billion
cubic
feet
per
day
bcfd
this
summer
which
includes
bcfd
from
pipelines
and
bcfd
from
storage
that
is
lower
than
the
bcfd
available
without
aliso
canyon
last
summer
and
well
below
the
bcfd
maximum
the
system
could
send
out
without
aliso
canyon
if
all
pipelines
were
available
the
group
has
previously
forecast
this
summer
s
projected
system
capacity
is
just
enough
to
cover
forecast
peak
demand
of
bcfd
the
report
said
warning
higher
gas
usage
or
loss
of
additional
pipelines
could
result
in
curtailments
of
the
fuel
to
electric
generators
