the
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
iran
deal
is
truly
irresponsible
putting
political
posturing
above
human
security
the
iran
nuclear
deal
made
the
world
safer
and
less
at
risk
of
nuclear
proliferation
the
agreement
cut
off
all
the
pathways
to
an
iranian
bomb
this
plays
into
the
hands
of
hardliners
in
iran
who
also
want
to
scuttle
the
deal
it
is
a
blow
to
america
s
credibility
undercutting
its
capacity
to
persuade
others
that
the
us
keeps
its
promises
the
rest
of
the
signatories
of
the
iran
deal
iran
china
france
germany
russia
the
united
kingdom
and
the
eu
should
forge
ahead
with

it
was
very
much
as
advertised
a
lot
of
people
were
this
and
it
became
clear
today
that
is
not
the
case
he
s
very
focused
on
the
oil
revenue
to
the
regime
there
are
other
sanctions
that
will
go
into
effect
as
well
and
i
think
he
spelled
that
out
in
his
remarks
as
well
he
indicated
in
the
speech
that
countries
that
do
business
with
iran
will
also
be
subject
to
sanctions
china
dealing
with
a
different
currency
could
potentially
escape
some
sanctions
but
any
country
that
wants
to
be
doing
business
with
the
needs
to
think
about
sanctions
it
s
going
to
have
a
potential
chilling
effect
in
companies

with
brian

macro
strategist

the
market
has
been
preparing
in
a
sense
for
this
announcement
the
combination
of
the
changeover
in
the
president
s
team
from
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
to
mike
pompeo
and
the
appointment
of
john
bolton
was
a
signal
to
the
market
of
the
direction
that
the
administration
was
going
you
have
seem
some
modest
flight
to
quality
though
it
hasn
t
been
major
i
think
right
now
there
s
still
quite
a
bit
of
uncertainty
about
the
future
of
the
deal
even
now
that
the
has
made
its
intentions
clear
we
do
know
that
the
european
union
has
said
they
will
continue
to
uphold
the
accord
regardless
of
the
decision
we
need
to
know
how
iran
will
respond
to
this
there
s
still
plenty
up
in
the
air
you
could
argue
that
president
trump
being
open
to
negotiation
of
a
better
deal
while
also
hanging
the
risk
of
sanctions
over
iran
that
if
an
agreement
could
still
be
reached
a
risky
scenario
could
be
eric
nuttall
partner
and
senior
portfolio
manager
at
ninepoint
partners
in
toronto
as
an
energy
investor
trump
announced
everything
that
one
could
possibly
have
wanted
him
to
say
the
term
that
he
used
was
the
highest
level
of
sanctions
we
re
obviously
looking
for
the
detail
to
this
but
it
gives
one
confidence
that
there
could
be
a
reduction
in
the
physical
movement
of
barrels
and
this
also
puts
at
stake
the
and
growth
ambitions
of
iran
to
grow
their
production
and
capacity
today
s
announcement
gives
energy
bulls
that
much
more
confidence
that
the
bull
market
for
oil
has
even
greater
longevity
for
it
i
think
we
re
going
to
next
year
for
wti
we
see
the
inventories
reaching
a
low
by
the
end
of
this
brian
battle
director
of
trading
at

capital
partners
in
chicago
this
is
a
really
telegraphed
policy
position
so
i
don
t
think
the
market
is
surprised
the
economic
effects
will
be
minimal
really
this
is
a
political
story
it
s
not
a
markets
or
an
economic
investors
are
also
reacting
to
trump
s
tone
he
s
not
closed
the
door
and
shunned
them
he
wants
a
new
deal
the
door
is
open
to
try
again
which
is
probably
less
harsh
than
what
he
could
have
michael
o
rourke
chief
market
strategist
at
jonestrading
in
greenwich
connecticut
there
was
so
much
of
this
leaked
out
there
in
the
media
it
doesn
t
seem
to
be
much
of
a
surprise
to
the
market
the
initial
reaction
was
that
defense
names
popped
and
rallied
oil
had
rallied
but
they
re
giving
back
now
as
well
overall
we
haven
t
moved
beyond
the
range
we
were
trading
jacques
rousseau
managing
director
of
clearview
energy
in
washington
i
think
people
are
sorting
through
what
could
actually
happen
is
there
actually
any
oil
that
s
going
to
leave
the
market
it
doesn
t
appear
so
in
the
if
you
take
a
look
at
what
s
going
on
now
iran
ships
about
million
barrels
per
day
to
asia
and
that
oil
is
unlikely
to
get
changed
at
all
those
buyers
which
are
mainly
china
india
and
korea
are
unlikely
to
adjust
their
plans
the
piece
that
could
come
into
play
is
what
goes
to
europe
about
barrels
a
day
goes
to
europe
and
so
it
depends
on
the
level
that
europe
is
cooperating
with
trump
one
important
thing
in
all
of
this
the
oil
in
iran
is
very
different
to
the
oil
in
venezuela
one
of
the
issues
venezuela
has
is
that
their
oil
is
very
heavy
and
sour
and
so
not
many
refiners
in
the
world
can
actually
process
it
if
for
example
the
stops
importing
the
oil
from
venezuela
it
s
a
little
more
difficult
to
find
a
home
for
it
whereas
the
oil
from
iran
is
medium
quality
so
there
s
a
lot
more
places
it
could
if
you
look
back
on
the
last
time
sanctions
came
into
effect
the
asian
buyers
did
not
cut
back
on
their
purchases
so
now
that
s
something
that
is
unlikely
to
occur
there
s
definitely
a
lot
of
little
ins
and
outs
that
could
try
and
steer
things
in
that
direction
in
terms
of
whether
cargoes
would
be
insured
there
s
a
lot
of
pieces
to
the
puzzle
and
i
m
not
sure
when
exactly
all
of
that
is
going
to
be
put
out
but
it
doesn
t
seem
like
there
s
going
to
be
volumes

in
the

it
s
difficult
to
see
how
going
back
to
the
old
iranian
sanctions
without
cooperation
from
major
european
countries
will
be
effective
it
might
have
an
impact
on
oil
pricing
more
than
anything
else
but
to
the
stock
market
i
don
t
see
a
big
move
one
way
or
the
other
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
s
not
that

i
do
think
that
there
is
a
good
chance
that
iranian
production
will
start
to
decline
by
and
iran
could
lose
roughly
bopd
over
the
next
months
this
should
oil
prices
to
continue
to
act

the
big
risk
is
a
crude
spike
which
trump
doesn
t
want
ahead
of
the
midterms
does
trump
really
want
that
from
a
political
strategy
point
of
view
so
does
he
bark
at
then
walk
it
back
if
oil
prices
go
too
high
but
the
secondary
impact
is
that
it
drives
up
inflation

could
lift

a
pullout
from

could

term
in
place
of
the
excess

we

already

a
within

that
has
been
quite
violent
so
this
on

is
basically
buy
the
rumor
sell
on
the
news
overall
that
intraday
move
to
positive
territory
in

investors
should
not
take
any
special
note
of
that
i
really
think
the
current
administration
rehearsed
its
signals
in
an
effective
manner
the
decision
to
pull
out
of
the
iran
deal
so
any
type
of
intraday
shift
within
the
market
is
playing
off
of
oil
prices
continuing
to
hit
lower
lows
it
applies
additional
pressure
to
the
overall
sentiment
of
the
market
as
the
dollar
continues
to
grind
higher
and
treasury
yields
continue
to
move
higher
as
well
that
s
the
overall
real

we
re
getting
conflicting
reports
about
the
iran
deal
cnn
reported
that
trump
would
not
withdraw
but
the
new
york
times
is
reporting
that
he
will
withdraw
the
market
will
struggle
until
we
get
clarity
on
this
the
original
report
was
that
he
would
stay
in
the
agreement
and
the
market
liked
that
because
its
less
global
tensions
then
the
ny
times
said
he
will
withdraw
so
that
brings
back
to
the
table
the
thought
of
global
tensions
with
iran
we
re
just
looking
at
iran
today
nothing
else
we
re
all
over
the
place
nobody
knows
what
the
right
answer
is
right
brian
larose
technical
analyst
new
york
i
ve
certainly
seen
reports
early
this
morning
suggesting
that
trump
was
going
to
walk
away
from
the
iran
deal
which
pushed
prices
higher
then
there
was
an
article
on
cnn
where
they
the
thought
then
about
an
hour
ago
was
that
we
were
going
to
remain
in
the
iran
deal
and
there
was
the
possibility
of
new
sanctions
and
all
that
information
has
kind
of
been
jarring
the
market
but
the
reality
is
at
this
point
we
have
not
broken
any
key
support
levels
in
crude
oil
so
there
s
still
an
opportunity
here
that
we
could
visit
fresh
highs
on
the
day
or
on
the
week
if
something
changes
by
o
clock
where
the
market
interprets
trump
s
decision
as
bullish
but
if
the
dollar
continues
to
rally
from
here
regardless
of
what
trump
does
with
this
iran
deal
any
gains
are
going
to
be
as
the
greatest
risk
here
is
the
risk
of
the
stan
shipley
strategist
evercore
isi
new
york
trump
is
going
to
leave
the
deal
but
this
is
pretty
well
anticipated
here
the
market
has
priced
this
in
pretty
well
here
there
are
still
deals
between
iran
with
the
europeans
russia
and
china
does
it
cause
iran
more
problem
to
move
money
around
the
world
yes
it
is
deal
for
the
it
raises
the
risk
that
iran
might
forgo
negotiations
and
go
ahead
with
its
nuclear
