update 1-imf warns of rising african debt despite faster economic growth
accra
reuters
african
nations
are
at
growing
risk
of
debt
distress
because
of
heavy
borrowing
and
gaping
deficits
despite
an
overall
uptick
in
economic
growth
the
international
monetary
fund
said
on
tuesday
the
sober
assessment
came
as
african
countries
continue
to
tap
international
debt
markets
and
issue
record
levels
of
debt
in
foreign
currencies
spurred
on
by
insatiable
investor
demand
for
yields
what
really
we
re
concerned
about
is
the
pace
of
increase
rather
than
the
average
imf
africa
director
abebe
aemro
selassie
told
reuters
at
the
launch
of
its
economic
outlook
for
the
region
in
accra
what
we
re
calling
for
right
now
is
that
those
countries
are
going
to
need
to
go
through
fiscal
consolidation
he
said
adding
that
oil
producers
and
other
economies
were
seeking
the
sharpest
growth
in
their
debt
loads
the
fund
projected
the
rate
of
economic
expansion
would
rise
to
percent
this
year
up
from
percent
in
boosted
by
global
growth
and
higher
commodity
prices
slower
growth
in
south
africa
and
nigeria
the
continent
s
two
largest
economies
weighed
on
the
average
but
the
imf
expects
growth
to
pick
up
in
around
of
african
nations
however
under
current
policies
that
rate
is
expected
to
plateau
below
percent
over
the
medium
term
meanwhile
around
percent
of
countries
in
the
region
are
now
in
debt
distress
or
at
high
risk
of
it
the
imf
report
said
and
refinancing
that
debt
could
soon
become
more
costly
the
current
growth
spurt
in
advanced
economies
is
expected
to
taper
off
and
the
borrowing
terms
for
the
region
s
frontier
markets
will
likely
become
less
favorable
which
could
coincide
with
higher
refinancing
needs
for
many
countries
across
the
region
it
said
african
governments
issued
a
record
billion
in
sovereign
bonds
last
year
times
more
than
in
and
they
have
issued
or
plan
to
issue
over
billion
in
additional
debt
in
the
first
half
of
alone
the
report
said
foreign
currency
debt
increased
by
percent
from
to
and
now
accounts
for
about
percent
of
the
region
s
total
public
debt
on
average
imf
data
showed
average
interest
payments
meanwhile
increased
from
percent
of
expenditures
in
to
percent
in
six
countries
chad
eritrea
mozambique
congo
republic
south
sudan
and
zimbabwe
were
judged
to
be
in
debt
distress
at
the
end
of
last
year
and
the
imf
s
ratings
for
zambia
and
ethiopia
were
changed
from
moderate
to
high
risk
of
debt
the
imf
conceded
that
africa
s
enormous
needs
will
continue
to
demand
heavy
investments
to
build
infrastructure
and
social
development
but
to
do
so
while
avoiding
the
risk
of
a
debt
trap
the
continent
which
currently
has
the
lowest
ratio
in
the
world
will
need
to
become
more
borrowing
to
finance
spending
is
part
of
the
macroeconomic
policy
tool
kits
which
all
countries
use
selassie
said
but
over
the
medium
to
they
have
to
rely
more
on
domestic
revenues
tax
revenues
to
address
their
development
spending
