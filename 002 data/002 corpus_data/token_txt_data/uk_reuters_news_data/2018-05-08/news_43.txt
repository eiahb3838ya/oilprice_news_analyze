swedish

euros
billion
pounds
from
berlin
for
forcing
it
to
halt
nuclear

the
german
government
has
said
in
a
letter
the
letter
seen
by
reuters
on
tuesday
was
addressed
to
a
german
lawmaker
who
had
inquired
about
the
government
s
position
on
vattenfall
s
attempts
to
seek
damages
from
the
international
centre
for
settlement
of
investment
disputes
icsid
in
germany
s
highest
court
ruled
that
utility
companies
were
allowed
to
seek
limited
damages
from
the
german
government
over
the
hastening
of
nuclear
plant
shutdowns
after
japan
s
fukushima
disaster
as
a
company
vattenfall
first
turned
to
the
icsid
in
with
the
filing
of
a
complaint
against
the
german
state
utilities
rwe
and
vattenfall
sued
the
german
government
arguing
that
the
decision
to
close
all
nuclear
plants
by
amounted
to
expropriation
in
the
pending
arbitration
case
of
vattenfall
against
the
federal
republic
of
germany
the
federal
government
has
requested
that
the
arbitration
be
dismissed
deputy
economy
minister
thomas
bareiss
wrote
in
the
letter
dated
april
pointing
to
a
recent
ruling
by
the
court
of
justice
of
the
european
union
ecj
on
a
similar
case
berlin
said
that
an
arbitration
from
a
court
outside
an
eu
country
in
relation
to
a
case
between
a
company
and
a
member
state
is
invalid
in
march
the
ecj
ruled
that
arbitration
clauses
common
to
almost
investment
agreements
between
eu
member
countries
violate
eu
law
casting
doubt
on
such
deals
and
others
struck
by
the
bloc
as
a
whole
the
ecj
found
that
an
award
of
damages
in
to
dutch
insurer
achmea
from
slovakia
under
a
bilateral
investment
treaty
inherited
from
former
czechoslovakia
breached
eu
law
vattenfall
which
is
expecting
a
decision
from
the
united
icsid
this
year
said
the
ecj
ruling
has
no
effect
on
its
pending
case
against
germany
unlike
the
achmea
case
this
procedure
is
based
on
the
european
energy
charter
treaty
the
contract
was
signed
not
only
by
all
member
states
and
third
countries
but
also
by
the
eu
said
vattenfall
s
media
relations
head
sandra
kuhberger
germany
also
rejected
as
baseless
compensation
claims
by
utilities
arguing
that
its
decision
to
end
nuclear
power
was
justified
because
nuclear
risks
had
changed
after
the
fukushima
meltdown
in
it
also
says
a
majority
of
voters
back
the
phasing
out
of
nuclear
power
vattenfall
is
not
questioning
the
decision
to
phase
out
nuclear
power
in
germany
but
we
insist
on
receiving
compensation
for
the
financial
loss
suffered
by
the
company
kuhberger
added
vattenfall
which
derives
much
of
its
turnover
from
activities
in
germany
had
to
idle
the
kruemmel
and
brunsbuettel
reactors
in
northern
germany
permanently
in
when
the
government
decided
to
close
old
reactors
and
accelerate
the
exit
programmes
for
the
remainder
icsid
declined
to
comment
on
any
potential
implications
of
the
previous
ecj
judgment
saying
it
did
not
have
the
parties
consent
to
disclose
further
information

the
status
of
