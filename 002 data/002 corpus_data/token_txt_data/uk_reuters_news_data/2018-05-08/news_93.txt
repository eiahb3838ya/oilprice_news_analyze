some
of

took
profit
after
trump
said
in
a
tweet
he
would
announce
his
decision
on
the

at

the

has
priced
in
the
high
likelihood
of
trump
withdrawing
from
the
nuclear
deal
with
iran
if
he
is
going
to
impose
sanctions
similar

yoshinori

noted
that
technology
shares
have
been
moving

of

there

currently
a
positive
feedback
loop

if
some
sort
of

negative
event
takes
place
it
may
turn
into
a
negative
feedback
loop

off
its

the
combination
of
higher

prices
a
strong

and
higher

is
risky
for
some
emerging

assets
as
it
could
significantly
worsen
their
trade
balance
and
also
encourage
investors
to
shift
