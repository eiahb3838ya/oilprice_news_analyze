oil
production
growth
combined
with
a
slowing
global
economy
will
put
oil
prices
under
downward
pressure
in
challenging
opec
s
resolve
to
support
the
market
with
output
cuts
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
friday
the
iea
which
coordinates
the
energy
policies
of
industrial
nations
said
it
was
keeping
its
estimate
of
oil
demand
growth
for
this
year
unchanged
at
million
barrels
per
day
close
to
levels
the
impact
of
higher
oil
prices
in
is
fading
which
will
help
offset
lower
economic
growth
the
iea
said
in
its
monthly
report
oil
rallied
above
per
barrel
in
the
second
half
of
on
concern
about
lower
supplies
from
iran
due
to
new
sanctions
but
crude
fell
towards
at
the
end
of
due
to
an
economic
slowdown
and
rising
supply
prompting
producer
group
opec
to
cut
output
in
an
effort
to
keep
prices
above
the
iea
said
global
oil
supply
last
month
fell
by
bpd
roughly
percent
led
by
lower
opec
output
even
before
the
organization
s
new
pact
took
effect
in
january
the
iea
said
production
growth
was
set
to
slow
to
million
bpd
in
after
record
annual
gains
of
million
bpd
in
however
the
united
states
will
continue
to
surprise
on
the
upside
the
united
states
already
the
biggest
liquids
supplier
will
reinforce
its
leadership
as
the
world
s
number
one
crude
producer
by
the
middle
of
the
year
crude
output
will
probably
be
more
than
the
capacity
of
either
saudi
arabia
or
russia
