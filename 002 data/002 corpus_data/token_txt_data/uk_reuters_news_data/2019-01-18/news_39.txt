germany
is
expected
to
import
million
tonnes
of
hard
coal
this
year
up
roughly
percent
from
despite
mounting
competition
from
renewable
energy
as
the
closure
of
domestic
mines
reduces
domestic
supply
importers
said
on
friday
the
total
would
comprise
an
estimated
million
tonnes
for
power
generation
and
million
tonnes
of
coking
coal
and
coke
products
used
in
steelmaking

germany
s
last
two
mines
in
the
west
of
the
country
closed
at
the
end
of
december
under
a
deal
to
stop
unprofitable
mining
in
favour
of
imports
the
pair
had

the
coal
importer
lobby
said
hard
coal
usage
would
benefit
from
a
court
ban
on
logging
in
an
ancient
forest
a
move
that
will
impede
the
mining

the
court
ruling
curbs
supply
to
rwe
s
power
plants
and
hard
coal
could
cover
part
of
the
deficit
the
two
types
of
coal
accounted
for
a
combined
percent
of
german
power
production
last
year
despite
the
forecast
rise
there
could
be
import
losses
in
as
a
result
of
a
national
plan
due
within
the
next
fortnight
on
phasing
out
coal
vdki
said
the
projected
increase
would
also
be
from
a
weaker
base
volumes
in
declined
by
percent
to
million
tonnes
as
renewable
energy
gets
priority
on

output
steam
coal
imports
for

alone
fell
percent
to

green
power
made
up
percent
of
total
generation
in
resulting
from
germany
s
politically
driven
process
to
replace
fossil
fuels
vdki
estimated
the
addition
of
green
power
plants
lost
it
million
tonnes
of
imports
last
year
while
relatively
high
solar
production
in
a
hot
year
also
played
a
part
just
like
was
a
very
bad
year
for
hard
coal
in
germany
vdki
chairman
wolfgang
cieslik
said
during
the
presentation
of
the
data
in
hamburg
vdki
managing
director
wodopia
said
steelmaking
usage
of
coal
could
benefit
from
higher
demand
projections
by
the

for

cautioned
that
the
macroeconomic
environment
had
recently
worsened
we
cautiously
expect
the

level
