global
stocks
rose
to
their
highest
in
more
than
a
month
on
friday
after
a
report
suggested
progress
towards
resolving
the
trade
dispute
between
the
united

and
china

the

followed
the

of

in

overnight
which
in
turn
took
their
cue
from
wall
street
s
performance
on
thursday
the
wall
street
journal
reported
on
thursday
that
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin

the

but
pared
some
of
the
gains
after

had
made
any
such
recommendation

also
reported
that
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
resisted
mnuchin

idea

the
story
was
probably
not
as
interesting

that

wrote
in

to

nonetheless
we
still
interpret
the
story
as
another
sign
that
a
trade
deal
is
moving
closer

markets
probably
do
