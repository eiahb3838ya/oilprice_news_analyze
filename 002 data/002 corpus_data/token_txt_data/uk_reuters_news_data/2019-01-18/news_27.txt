before
prices
of
basic
goods
spiked
in
zimbabwe
this
month
cab
driver
and
victor
makazhu
could
buy
nearly
two
weeks
of
groceries
for
now
that
sum
will
get
him
less
than
seven
days
worth
inflation
soared
to
a
high
above
percent
in
december
and
has
probably
risen
further
since
president
emmerson
mnangagwa
this
week
raised
fuel
prices
by
percent
leading
to
protests
that
have
triggered
a
crackdown
by
security
forces
at
the
moment
i
can
not
afford
adequate
food
for
my
family
makazhu
said
after
shopping
for
staples
in
central
harare
on
thursday
these
groceries
will
not
last
me
a
week
he
told
reuters
pointing
to
kg
packs
of
sugar
rice
flour
and
maize
meal
and
milk
the
southern
african
nation
dumped
its
currency
in
and
adopted
the
dollar
over
time
supplies
of
dollars
have
dried
up
and
in
november
authorities
in
harare
launched
a
surrogate
bond
notes
covered
by
a
hard
currency
loan
and
pegged
at
to
the
dollar
on
the
street
however
now
fetches
up
to
three
bond
notes
leaving
citizens
able
to
do
little
but
watch
as
the
money
in
their
bank
accounts
loses
value
compared
with
hard
cash
few
could
blame
zimbabweans
for
feeling
a
sense
of
deja
vu
while
nowhere
near
the
billion
percent
hyperinflation
of
the
crisis
of
the
country
is
again
grappling
with
soaring
prices
and
shortages
of
fuel
and
medicines
after
four
hours
of
what
locals
call
speculative
queueing
outside
a
filling
station
in
the
center
of
town
schoolteacher
gilbert
kepekepe
was
still
nowhere
near
getting
served
before
the
latest
price
increase
he
used
to
spend
to
fill
his
tank
which
he
did
twice
a
month
now
that
would
cost
him
i
will
have
to
probably
cut
on
some
other
things
or
simply
decide
not
to
drive
to
work
but
the
other
question
is
is
it
cheaper
to
use
public
transport
said
kepekepe
analysts
said
the
fuel
price
hike
would
trickle
down
to
other
basic
goods
and
services
and
public
taxis
known
as
kombis
have
at
least
doubled
their
fares
in
the
last
two
weeks
