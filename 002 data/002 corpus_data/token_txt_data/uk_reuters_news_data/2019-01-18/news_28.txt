tunisia
also
plans

raising
the
output
will
boost

the

said
phosphate
exports
are
a
key
source
of
foreign
currency
reserves
which
have
dropped
to
levels
worth
just
days
of
imports
according
tunisia
s
central

tunisia
produced
about
million
tonnes
of
phosphate
in
but
output
dropped
after
its
revolution
annual
output
has
not
exceeded
million
tonnes
since
feriani
said
lower
production
has
caused
tunisia
to
lose
markets
and
about
billion
each
year
phosphate
exports
were
hit
by
repeated
protests
in
the
main
producing
region
of
gafsa
where
unemployed
youth
demanding

blockaded
