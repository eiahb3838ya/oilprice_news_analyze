climate plans could make germany's 'no limits' autobahns history
berlin
reuters
the
days
of
unlimited
speeding
on
germany
s
famously
fast
autobahns
could
be
over
if
the
government
adopts
a
series
of
draft
proposals
on
climate
protection
put
forward
by
its
committee
on
the
future
of
transport
charged
with
coming
up
with
recommendations
on
reducing
the
environmental
harm
caused
by
transport
the
committee
also
proposed
fuel
tax
hikes
and
electric
vehicle
quotas
to
help
germany
finally
meet
european
union
emissions
targets
the
proposals
outlined
in
a
draft
paper
seen
by
reuters
could
prove
controversial
in
germany
whose
motorway
network
is
famous
for
no
limits
sections
where
drivers
can
put
even
the
fastest
cars
through
their
paces
germany
could
be
hit
with
heavy
eu
fines
if
it
fails
to
reduce
emissions
of
greenhouse
gases
and
poisonous
nitrogen
oxides
transport
emissions
which
have
not
fallen
since
are
a
particular
target
for
reductions
the
government
is
torn
between
the
need
to
protect
germany
s
crucial
car
industry
buffeted
by
a
series
of
costly
emissions
cheating
scandals
in
recent
years
and
the
need
to
act
to
protect
a
rapidly
deteriorating
climate
the
paper
says
measures
including
a
motorway
speed
limit
of
kmh
and
fuel
tax
hikes
from
the
abolition
of
tax
breaks
for
diesel
cars
and
quotas
for
electric
and
hybrid
car
sales
could
deliver
half
the
greenhouse
gas
emissions
cuts
that
are
needed
the
national
platform
on
the
future
of
mobility
has
yet
to
finalize
the
recommendations
it
is
due
to
report
its
findings
at
the
end
of
march
which
will
then
be
incorporated
into
a
climate
change
law
the
government
wants
to
enact
this
year
but
the
committee
is
well
aware
that
many
of
its
suggestions
could
be
controversial
not
every
instrument
and
every
measure
will
be
accepted
reads
the
draft
it
will
take
political
deftness
diplomatic
skill
and
a
willingness
to
compromise
to
achieve
the
climate
