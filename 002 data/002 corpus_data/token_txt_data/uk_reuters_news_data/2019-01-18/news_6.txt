it

to
the

that
they
re
serious
said
phil
flynn
an

at

group
in

i
think
they
also
want
to
point
out
that
they
re
probably
going
to
be
overcompliant
with
these
numbers
especially
from
saudi
the
opec
and
ministerial

also
called
on
members
and
the

s
allies
including
russia
to
redouble
their
efforts
in
the
full

timely
implementation
of
the

the

agreed

opec
s
monthly
report
showed
it
had
made
a
strong
start
in

the
pact
went
into

implementing
the
biggest
production
drop
in
almost
two

also
buoyed
by
signs
that

a
bloomberg
report
on
friday
showed
china
offered
to
go
on
a
buying
spree
of
goods
which
investors
saw
as
an
attempt
to
draw
closer
to
a
trade
deal
with
washington
however
some
signs
of
weakening
demand
and
surging
output
may
keep
prices
in
check
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
friday
that
oil
production
growth
combined
with
a
slowing
global
economy
would
put
oil
prices
under
pressure
by
the
middle
of
the
year
crude
output
will
probably
be
more
than
the
capacity
of
either
saudi
arabia
or
russia
said
the
iea
which
kept
its
estimate
of
oil
demand
growth
unchanged
and
close
to
levels
at
million
barrels
