update 2-eu chemicals agency proposes ban on deliberately added microplastics to combat pollution
helsinki
reuters
the
eu
chemicals
agency
echa
on
friday
proposed
a
ban
on
deliberately
adding
microplastics
to
products
such
as
cosmetics
detergents
and
agricultural
fertilisers
in
the
eu
by
to
combat
pollution
the
tiny
bits
of
plastic
pollution
in
waterways
and
oceans
are
causing
growing
concern
among
scientists
about
their
effect
on
marine
ecosystems
the
european
commission
which
estimates
that
between
and
tonnes
of
microplastics
enter
the
environment
each
year
had
requested
the
proposal
from
the
echa
as
part
of
its
plastics
strategy
the
aim
is
to
avoid
nearly
tonnes
of
microplastics
ending
up
in
nature
a
year
the
echa
s
spokesman
matti
vainio
said
at
a
conference
in
helsinki
the
commission
s
vice
president
jyrki
katainen
who
also
spoke
at
the
event
said
an
eu
ban
could
set
a
standard
for
industries
around
the
world
the
european
union
is
first
in
the
world
to
have
launched
a
comprehensive
plastics
strategy
which
aims
at
reducing
also
microplastics
he
said
the
echa
will
present
its
official
proposal
within
a
year
for
the
eu
member
countries
to
consider
and
katainen
said
the
commission
could
approve
it
towards
the
end
of
vainio
warned
the
use
of
microplastics
would
continue
to
increase
rapidly
without
the
ban
it
emerged
as
a
surprise
to
us
that
agriculture
is
the
largest
user
of
microplastics
vainio
said
referring
to
a
technology
to
encapsulate
agricultural
fertilizers
within
tiny
plastic
shells
that
emit
them
slowly
into
the
soil
but
leave
behind
microplastics
the
proposed
ban
would
exclude
some
products
such
as
medicine
and
paints
