global
oil
refining
capacity
is
set
to
increase
at
its
fastest
pace
on
record
this
year
possibly
boosting
stocks
of
products
such
as
diesel
gasoline
and
marine
fuel
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
friday
oil
refining
capacity
will
rise
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
and
demand
for
refined
products
by
around
million
bpd
the
iea
said
in
a
monthly
report
it
was
not
clear
yet
what
that
meant
for
margins
which
slumped
as
the
price
of
crude
rose
last
year
said
the
iea
which
coordinates
the
energy
policies
of
industrialised
countries
this
demand
growth
utilises
only
half
of
the
new
capacity
coming
on
stream
if
refining
margins
are
supported
by
accommodating
crude
prices
utilisation
rates
will
not
decline
this
should
mean
that
product
stocks
will
increase
it
said
an
increase
in
stocks
of
refined
products
could
be
useful
the
iea
said
ahead
of
the
implementation
next
year
of
regulations
by
the
international
maritime
organization
to
reduce
sulphur
content
in
shipping
fuel
margins
remain
under
pressure
from
rising
oil
throughput
which
hit
a
historic
high
last
month
at
million
bpd
refineries
will
process
million
bpd
this
year
compared
with
million
bpd
last
year
according
to
the
agency
the
global
refining
industry
is
facing
a
challenging
if
average
crude
prices
continue
moving
higher
for
the
third
consecutive
year
refining
margins
may
decline
to
levels
that
force
slowdown
in
some
refining
regions
