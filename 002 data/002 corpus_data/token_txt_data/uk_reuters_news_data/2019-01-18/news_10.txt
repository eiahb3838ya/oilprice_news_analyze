reuters
brazil
is
moving
toward
a
system
for
food
processors
agriculture
minister
tereza
cristina
dias
said
on
friday
including
meatpackers
still
recovering
from
an
inspection
scandal
that
hurt
trade
with
key
markets
dias
said
in
an
interview
that
the
south
american
nation
s
new
government
plans
to
send
draft
legislation
on
to
congress
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
widely
used
in
the
united
states
and
other
developed
countries
in
europe
would
be
introduced
gradually
across
various
agricultural
products
and
eventually
be
used
for
oversight
of
meatpackers
why
can
t
brazil
do
when
europe
and
the
united
states
use
it
dias
told
reuters
commercial
partners
banned
certain
brazilian
meat
producers
after
a
federal
probe
revealed
alleged
bribery
and
falsified
inspection
results
in
the
country
s
meat
exporting
industry
the
world
s
largest
the
scandal
briefly
threatened
about
billion
in
exports
from
brazil
s
powerhouse
protein
industry
as
markets
from
china
to
europe
curtailed
shipments
of
meat
pending
a
review
of
the
south
american
nation
s
inspection
protocols
but
dias
a
farm
lobby
congresswoman
who
was
picked
to
head
the
agriculture
ministry
by
new
president
jair
bolsonaro
adamantly
defended
the
food
industry
s
ability
to
monitor
itself
our
agriculture
sector
can
provide
guarantees
just
because
of
one
episode
we
shouldn
t
demonize
brazil
s
food
industry
she
said
dias
argued
that
brazilian
multinational
companies
already
use
at
subsidiaries
abroad
brazil
is
home
to
meatpacking
giants
jbs
sa
and
brf
sa
both
of
which
were
implicated
in
the
ongoing
food
probes
the
federal
investigation
which
started
in
and
was
expanded
last
year
is
examining
relations
between
food
processors
agriculture
ministry
officials
and
laboratories
with
a
mandate
to
certify
the
safety
of
meat
sold
domestically
and
in
foreign
markets
such
as
china
japan
the
middle
east
and
europe
jbs
and
brf
declined
to
comment
on
the
introduction
of
a
system
meat
industry
lobby
group
abpa
said
it
supports
initiatives
to
strengthen
quality
controls
without
elaborating
dias
said
she
could
not
give
specifics
on
what
oversight
would
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
government
since
the
matter
was
still
under
discussion
with
companies
dias
said
she
has
not
begun
talks
with
the
european
union
over
lifting
its
ban
on
brazilian
chicken
imports
as
the
bolsonaro
government
which
took
office
on
was
still
formulating
its
policies
the
agriculture
minister
said
she
may
travel
to
china
in
february
or
march
but
no
date
for
the
trip
has
been
set
beijing
has
imposed
measures
on
brazilian
chicken
products
which
brasília
is
trying
to
get
lifted
brazil
s
farm
sector
is
also
concerned
that
bolsonaro
s
plan
to
move
the
country
s
israeli
embassy
to
jerusalem
could
hurt
halal
meat
sales
to
muslim
countries
dias
said
exports
of
halal
food
including
beef
chicken
honey
and
cheese
rose
to
an
estimated
billion
last
year
of
course
the
agricultural
sector
that
i
represent
is
worried
she
said
when
asked
about
possible
repercussions
for
trade
with
arab
countries
angered
by
the
foreign
policy
shift
by
brazil
which
has
traditionally
backed
a
solution
to
the
conflict
she
said
the
policy
is
still
being
ironed
out
within
brazil
s
government
and
talks
are
being
held
with
trading
partners
we
have
to
find
a
middle
ground
going
forward
because
brazil
can
not
lose
markets
what
we
need
is
to
open
new
markets
