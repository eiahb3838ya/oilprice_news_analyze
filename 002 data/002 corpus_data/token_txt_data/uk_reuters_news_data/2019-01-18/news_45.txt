energy
fund
managers
took
heavy
losses
last
year
with
bets
on
the
prices
of
oil
and
natural
gas
leading
to
a
wave
of
closures
in
the
volatile
fund
sector
the
number
of
active
funds
fell
to
just
in
through
september
from
about
in
according
to
the
latest
available
data
from
hedge

industry
tracker
eurekahedge
that
s
the
lowest
number
of
active
funds
since
the
number
of
funds
solely
focused
on
oil
or
gas
has
tumbled
to
in
from
in
funds
that
have
suspended
operations

along
with
smaller
niche
funds
such
as
casement

there
is
a
massive
decline
in
the
number
of

and
no
replacements
said
david

of

there
has
been
a
near

event
in

hedge
we
had
about
large
hedge

trading
natural

in
houston
a
few
years
ago
he
said
that
number
is
now
reduced
to
a
small
number
of
some
funds
saw
investors
pull
out
because
they
increasingly
view
energy
as
an
unsafe
spot
for
their
money

suspended

after
difficulties
raising

interest
two
industry
sources
said
the
firm
was
supported
by
lighthouse
partners
according
to
a
regulatory
filing
lighthouse
declined
to
comment
and
mooney
would
not
elaborate
on
the
reasons
for
casement
s
decision
to
close
all
hedge

including
commodities

are
being
scrutinized

coming
under
pressure

commodities
closures
of
hedge
funds
have
outpaced
launches
in
the
last
three
years
according
to
data
from
eurekahedge
it
becomes
goldberg
said
in
an
interview
if
people
lose
money
and
are
seeing
negative
feedback
for
it
they
cut
risk
and
it
becomes
harder
and
harder
to
manage
the
macro
hedge
funds
those
with
strategies
based
on
broad
global
macroeconomic
trends
such
as
a
bet
that
oil
prices
will
rise
were
among
the
hardest
hit
falling
percent
in
that
s
the
weakest
annual
performance
since
when
such

fell

according
to
a
late

estimate

in

goldberg
said
he
would
wind
down

flagship

and
focus
instead
on

in

reuters
reported
goldberg
said
in
december
that
returns
had
been
limited
recently
funds
took
heavy
losses
this
past
year
when
oil
prices
took
an
unexpected
dive
beginning
in
october
amid
growing
worries
about
oversupply
and
weakening
demand
oilfields
hit
an
production
record
last
year
at
more
than
million
barrels
a
day
a
sharp
rise
in
natural
gas
prices
in
late
on
concerns
of
tight
supplies
and
cold
weather
also
added
to
the
pain
because
many
funds
had
paired
bets
on
lower
natural
gas
and
higher
crude
fluctuations
in
prices
typically
create
opportunities
for
fund
managers
to
book
a
profit
but
the
moves
of
oil
and
gas
prices
followed
a
prolonged
period
of
subdued
volatility
in
energy
markets
and
caught
fund
managers
off
guard
oil
prices
had
rallied
through
most
of
the
year
and
hedge
funds
built
increasingly
large
bets
on
the
rally
continuing
money
managers
began
the
year
with
a
record
number
of
bullish
open
positions
in
crude
and
largely
maintained
them
near
those
levels
until
that
changed
late
last
year
when
the
granted
waivers
to
big
purchasers
of
iran
s
oil
after
reinstating
sanctions
on
the
nation
and
as
the
united
states
russia
and
saudi
arabia
all
produced
at
record
levels
feeding
worries
about
a
supply
glut
the
market
sunk
in
a
series
of
volatile
trading
days
as
funds
rushed
to
unload
positions
hedge
fund
investors
said
they
do
not
see
the
situation
for
niche
funds
improving
among
those
that
have
been
having
the
most
difficulty
are
natural
