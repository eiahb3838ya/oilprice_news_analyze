sinopec's marketing arm listing may prove hard sell in soft markets
kong
reuters
sinopec
corp
asia
s
top
refiner
may
have
a
hard
time
finding
buyers
for
a
stock
offering
of
its
fuel
marketing
arm
because
of
investor
pushback
against
higher
valuations
amid
tepid
equity
markets
sinopec
won
final
regulatory
approval
in
december
for
the
listing
of
its
marketing
unit
in
hong
kong
said
two
people
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
the
company
runs
the
world
s
largest
retail
fuel
network
with
over
gas
stations
convenience
stores
as
well
as
pipelines
and
storage
for
refined
fuel
products
across
china
the
world
s
oil
consumer
after
the
united
states
but
sinopec
may
have
picked
a
bad
time
for
an
initial
public
offering
ipo
for
a
fuel
marketing
company
amid
investor
fears
of
slowing
economic
growth
in
china
which
posted
a
drop
in
exports
and
imports
in
december
as
its
trade
war
with
the
united
states
drags
on
hong
kong
heng
seng
index
has
dropped
percent
since
it
hit
a
record
in
january
more
specifically
there
are
concerns
about
slowing
chinese
oil
demand
growth
and
the
potential
oversupply
of
fuels
in
the
country
in
november
sinochem
energy
put
its
hong
kong
ipo
on
hold
even
after
it
lowered
its
valuation
reducing
the
amount
of
funds
it
expected
raise
to
about
billion
from
billion
it
will
be
a
hard
sell
for
sinopec
said
one
of
the
two
sources
a
banking
analyst
who
tracks
sinopec
closely
the
market
has
an
average
ratio
of
or
times
but
sinopec
is
looking
for
more
than
times
said
the
analyst
referring
to
a
common
metric
for
valuing
companies
that
measures
how
much
an
investor
is
paying
for
a
portion
of
a
company
s
earnings
sinopec
corp
declined
to
comment
on
its
ipo
plans
the
slowing
market
may
mean
a
further
delay
for
an
ipo
that
has
been
under
discussion
since
sinopec
attempted
to
raise
billion
through
a
listing
of
the
fuel
marketing
business
in
in
sinopec
sold
a
nearly
percent
share
of
the
business
to
investors
for
billion
valuing
the
company
then
at
about
billion
in
the
then
largest
privatization
push
of
enterprises
since
president
xi
jinping
took
office
this
time
sinopec
will
list
the
marketing
arm
through
a
separately
incorporated
entity
sinopec
marketing
ltd
which
was
set
up
just
weeks
after
the
national
development
and
reform
commission
and
later
the
state
council
approved
the
listing
plan
said
the
second
of
the
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
sinopec
will
try
its
best
to
list
its
marketing
division
in
now
that
the
top
government
body
has
given
the
the
source
said
declining
to
be
named
as
the
subject
was
not
public
a
separate
banking
source
estimated
that
sinopec
s
ipo
could
happen
in
the
fourth
quarter
as
the
firm
has
not
started
discussing
the
sale
with
banks
yet
and
none
have
been
mandated
to
work
on
the
deal
