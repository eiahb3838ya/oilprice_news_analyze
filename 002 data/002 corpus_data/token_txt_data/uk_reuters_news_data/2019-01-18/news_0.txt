can
not
work
on
seismic

boem

said
the

further
due

the
pending
litigation
the
trump
administration
s
plans
to
open
up
offshore
drilling
along
the
eastern
seaboard
has
riled
state
governments
including
south
carolina
who
fear
seismic
testing
and
offshore
drilling
will
harm
their
lucrative
tourism
industries
while
oil
and
gas
exploration
could
bring
in
billions
of
dollars
doing
it
without
adequate
study
and
precautions
could
end
up
costing
billions
of
dollars
and
cause
irreversible

to
our
