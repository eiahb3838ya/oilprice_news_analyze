interview-turkish cypriots seek end to natural gas dispute
washington
reuters
northern
cyprus
wants
to
resolve
a
dispute
over
natural
gas
drilling
with
greek
cypriots
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
its
leading
to
wide
instability
the
breakaway
state
s
deputy
prime
minister
said
after
visits
with
trump
administration
officials
and
lawmakers
we
believe
this
is
an
unfair
situation
which
may
put
the
stability
of
the
region
at
risk
kudret
ozersay
who
is
also
foreign
minister
of
northern
cyprus
said
in
an
interview
last
week
ozersay
was
on
his
first
diplomatic
visit
to
the
united
states
in
his
current
position
for
northern
cyprus
which
only
turkey
recognizes
as
a
country
cyprus
is
thought
to
have
rich
deposits
of
offshore
natural
gas
but
the
island
is
divided
and
tensions
are
rising
about
the
drilling
cyprus
was
split
by
a
turkish
invasion
in
that
followed
a
coup
northern
cyprus
is
now
a
turkish
cypriot
state
of
about
people
greek
cypriots
who
run
cyprus
internationally
recognized
government
have
licensed
several
offshore
blocks
to
multinational
energy
companies
for
exploration
they
have
said
a
peace
deal
would
allow
both
communities
to
benefit
from
any
offshore
resources
but
have
balked
at
including
the
issue
in
settlement
talks
peace
talks
collapsed
in
next
month
greek
cypriots
and
exxon
mobil
are
due
to
announce
the
results
of
offshore
natural
gas
exploration
ozersay
said
the
terms
of
drilling
are
unacceptable
because
they
allow
greek
cypriots
to
profit
from
drilling
even
before
a
settlement
is
reached
while
turkish
cypriots
can
only
profit
after
such
an
agreement
there
is
a
window
of
opportunity
for
the
two
sides
to
agree
terms
to
drilling
that
are
acceptable
to
northern
cyprus
said
ozersay
who
talked
with
officials
to
pressure
for
change
last
year
cyprus
accused
the
turkish
military
of
blocking
the
saipem
drill
ship
contracted
by
italian
company
eni
from
exploring
for
natural
gas
turkey
claimed
that
certain
areas
of
cyprus
s
offshore
exclusive
economic
zone
or
eez
fall
under
the
jurisdiction
of
turkey
or
that
of
turkish
cypriots
the
move
was
noticed
by
washington
local
media
reported
in
june
that
wess
mitchell
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
for
european
and
eurasian
affairs
said
washington
had
been
clear
in
its
messaging
with
turkish
officials
that
harassment
of
drilling
vessels
in
the
eez
is
not
something
that
we
will
allow
to
go
unnoticed
or
speak
up
the
state
department
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
about
the
meeting
with
ozersay
ozersay
said
northern
cyprus
has
cooperated
with
international
bodies
to
extradite
individuals
listed
on
interpol
the
international
police
body
and
wants
to
continue
the
efforts
a
hint
that
the
breakaway
state
should
be
recognized
for
its
efforts
to
the
extent
possible
we
will
try
to
implement
the
rules
of
international
law
and
we
will
be
ready
to
cooperate
with
international
actors
and
organizations
he
said
an
expert
on
european
energy
politics
said
northern
cyprus
was
trying
to
build
momentum
while
president
donald
trump
expects
warmer
relations
with
turkey
clearly
the
trump
administration
is
trying
to
improve
relations
with
turkey
thus
it
is
logical
that
northern
cyprus
is
trying
to
leverage
a
deal
