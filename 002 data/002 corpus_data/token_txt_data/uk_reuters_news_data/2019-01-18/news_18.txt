open
indigenous
land
to
commercial
farming
agriculture
minister
tereza
cristina
dias
said
on
friday
while
also
seeking
to
soften
many
of
president
jair
bolsonaro
s
controversial
stances
on
native
people
and
the
environment
farmers
form
a
key
base
of
support
for
firebrand
bolsonaro
who
since
taking
office
has
placed
policies
at
the
center
of
his
agenda
activists
warn
his
government
s
positions
would
strip
away
protections
for
the
environment
the
amazon
rainforest
and
indigenous
peoples
reservation
land
covering
roughly
percent
of
brazil
s
territory
is
currently
off
limits
for
commercial
farming
they
could
plant
there
and
maybe
have
income
for
their
community
dias
told
reporters
they
can
not
do
this
today
that
needs
to
be
changed
in
reservations
should
still
be
required
to
preserve
a
minimum
percentage
of
native
vegetation
as
all
farmers
currently
are
she
said
bolsonaro
has
given
control
over
indigenous
land
designations
to
the
agriculture
ministry
after
arguing
on
the
campaign
trail
that
no
new
indigenous
reservations
should
be
created
but
dias
struck
a
more
moderate
tone
saying
bolsonaro
did
not
favor
new
reservations
in
areas
that
have
long
been
settled
by
farmers
small
farmers
that
have
been
there
years
and
have
deeds
issued
by
the
state
or
federal
government
if
you
kick
them
out
there
aren
t
conditions
there
for
indigenous
people
to
hunt
and
fish
and
have
their
lives
she
said
in
a
press
briefing
when
the
president
says
he
doesn
t
want
more
demarcations
he
s
talking
about
this
type
of
contested
but
the
amazon
deserves
completely
different
treatment
and
tribes
with
little
contact
with
the
outside
world
should
be
protected
she
said
a
position
that
is
shared
by
brazil
s
new
rights
minister
who
will
be
responsible
for
indigenous
affairs
bolsonaro
has
suggested
brazil
may
exit
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
and
appointed
a
foreign
minister
who
calls
global
warming
a
leftist
fabrication
but
dias
said
she
is
fine
with
staying
in
the
accord
as
the
country
is
on
track
to
meet
its
climate
change
goals
as
for
a
campaign
promise
to
end
the
industry
of
environmental
fines
dias
told
reuters
prior
to
the
briefing
that
brazil
must
end
indiscriminate
fines
levied
by
multiple
agencies
without
working
with
the
farmers
to
resolve
misunderstandings
