by
a
loyal
ruling
caste
of
businessmen
trade
unions
and
the

the

since
and

wants
to
seek
a

under
the
constitution
the
election
date
was
made
necessary
by
the
expiry
in
april
of
bouteflika
s
fourth
term
algeria
s
ruling
coalition
and
other
leading
figures
in
labour
unions
and
the
business
world
had
previously
urged
him
to
run
again
for
the
presidency
but
there
have
been
concerns
about
his
health
in
december
boutelfika
who
has
been
since
was
unable
to
meet
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
when
he
came
to
algiers
for
a
visit
due
to
acute
flu
his
last
meeting
with
a
senior
foreign
official
was
during
a
visit
by
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
on
an
earlier
meeting
with
merkel
and
a
meeting
with
italian
prime
minister
giuseppe
conte
were
cancelled
the
north
african
country
an
opec
oil
producer
avoided
the
major
political
upheaval
seen
in
many
other
arab
countries
in
the
past
decade
but
has
experienced
some
protests
and
strikes
unemployment
especially
among
young
people
remains
high
the
economy
has
improved
over
the
past
year
as
oil
and
gas
revenues
have
picked
up
allowing
authorities
to
ease
austerity
measures
imposed
when
they
halved
between
to
oil
and
gas
revenues
account
for
percent
of
the
budget
and
percent
of
export
revenues
analysts
said
bouteflika
s
announcement
of
the
election
date
will
ease
concerns
that
the
vote
might
get
postponed
in
the
army
cancelled
elections
which
an
islamist
party
was
set
to
win
triggering
almost
a
decade
of
civil
war
that
killed
some
people
this
decision
shows
that
bouteflika
is
sticking
to
the
constitution
said
political
analyst
arslan
chikhaoui
observers
say
if
bouteflika
runs
again
he
is
set
to
win
as
the
opposition
is
divided
into
islamists
and
secular
parties
bouteflika
is
part
of
a
thinning
elite
of
the
veterans
who
fought
france
in
the
independence
war
and
have
run
algeria
ever
since
many
also
credit
him
with
ending
the
civil
war
by
offering
former
islamist
fighters
amnesty
bouteflika
s
supporters
say
his
mind
remains
sharp
even
though
he
needs
a
microphone
to
speak
the
opposition
says
he
is
not
fit
to
run
again
he
is
unlikely
to
face
competition
from
within
ruling
circles
prime
minister
ahmed
ouyahia
leader
of
the
national
rally
for
democracy
rnd
allied
to
the
fln
has
already
said
he
will
not
run
if
bouteflika
goes
for
a
fifth
term
nobody
has
yet
said
they
will
run
against
bouteflika
even
though
the
president
has
said
he
wants
more
competition
he
won
with
percent
of
the
vote
in
percent
in
percent
in
and
percent
in
the
government
has
said
it
wants
to
diversify
the
economy
away
from
oil
and
gas
which
accounts
for
percent
of
budget
finances
but
there
has
been
resistance
from
those
within
the
ruling
elite
to
opening
up
to
foreign
investment
that
has
left
the
economy
dominated
by
the
state
