refiners
are
bidding
up
prices
for
scarce
types
of
crude
oil
needed
for
their
most
sophisticated
plants
as
the
united
states
reconsiders
harsher
sanctions
on
venezuela
that
could
further
reduce
imports
of
the
country
s
oil
trump
administration
officials
in
recent
days
met
with
oil
company
executives
to
lay
out
potential
actions
in
response
to
the
inauguration
of
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
in
an
election
it
considered
illegitimate
among
other
steps
officials
have
recognized
the
venezuelan
congress
as
the
only
legitimately
elected
authority
but
the
proposals
that
would
most
affect
the
energy
industry
involve
banning
exports
of
refined
products
or
limiting
oil
imports
a
move
that
until
now
the
white
house
has
not
taken
even
after
sanctioning
individuals
and
barring
access
to
banks
it
s
more
serious
than
i
ve
heard
before
said
a
refining
industry
executive
familiar
with
the
white
house
discussions
they
are
setting
the
table
to
pull
the
trigger
if
they
have
refiners
have
few
supply
alternatives
if
the
trump
administration
were
to
cut
off
crude
imports
from
that
country
supplies
of
the
heavy
oils
preferred
by
gulf
coast
refiners
have
been
harder
to
secure
in
recent
months
because
of
cutbacks
and
production
curbs
in
western
canada
mexico
and
venezuela

so
again

week

several
people
close

big

latin
american
advisors
have
warned
the

could
backfire

making
the
united

appear
too
involved
in
the
venezuelan
political
crisis
