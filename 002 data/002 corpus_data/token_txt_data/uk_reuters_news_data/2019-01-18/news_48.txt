focus-after billion-barrel bonanza, bp goes global with seismic tech
london
reuters
buoyed
by
the
success
of
seismic
imaging
that
found
an
extra
billion
barrels
of
oil
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
bp
is
looking
to
take
its
latest
technology
to
angola
and
brazil
the
software
used
in
the
gulf
based
on
an
algorithm
created
by
xukai
shen
a
geophysicist
straight
out
of
stanford
university
led
to
bp
discovering
the
crude
in
an
area
where
it
had
long
thought
there
was
none
to
be
found
industry
experts
said
the
scale
of
the
discovery
km
below
bp
s
thunder
horse
field
announced
last
week
marked
a
major
leap
forward
for
deepwater
exploration
a
costly
business
known
for
its
low
success
rate
and
high
risk
it
is
an
example
of
how
technology
is
helping
deepwater
make
a
comeback
after
a
decade
when
the
industry
has
focused
on
advances
in
onshore
shale
the
new
deposit
was
found
with
software
known
as
full
waveform
inversion
fwi
which
is
run
on
a
and
analyses
reverberations
of
seismic
soundwaves
to
produce
images
of
ancient
layers
of
rock
thousands
of
metres
under
the
sea
bed
helping
geologists
locate
oil
and
gas
it
is
more
accurate
than
previous
surveying
methods
bp
said
and
processes
data
in
a
matter
of
days
compared
with
months
or
years
previously
while
the
discovery
marked
the
biggest
industry
success
for
digital
seismic
imaging
the
british
oil
major
s
rivals
are
hot
on
its
heel
with
similar
techniques
bp
scientist
john
etgen
the
company
s
top
adviser
on
seismic
imaging
said
it
aimed
to
retain
its
edge
with
a
new
machine
it
has
developed
wolfspar
to
be
used
alongside
fwi
the
wolfspar
is
dragged
by
a
ship
through
the
ocean
and
emits
very
low
frequency
soundwaves
which
are
particularly
effective
for
penetrating
thick
salt
layers
that
lie
above
rocks
containing
fossil
fuels
he
added
etgen
told
reuters
that
bp
planned
to
roll
out
wolfspar
alongside
fwi
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
at
the
atlantis
field
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
where
a
large
salt
layer
still
hides
parts
of
the
site
the
company
plans
to
expand
the
use
of
the
technology
to
other
big
oil
and
gas
basins
including
brazil
next
year
and
angola
at
a
later
stage
he
said
seeing
through
very
complex
very
distorted
salt
bodies
was
the
hardest
problem
we
had
the
most
challenging
the
scientist
said
in
an
interview
in
both
brazil
and
angola
oil
deposits
are
locked
under
thick
salt
layers
brazil
s
deepwater
oil
fields
comprise
one
of
the
world
s
basins
in
terms
of
production
bp
last
year
signed
a
partnership
with
brazil
s
national
oil
company
petrobras
to
develop
resources
there
oil
finds
are
rare
particularly
in
mature
basins
like
the
gulf
of
mexico
but
the
scale
of
output
from
deepwater
wells
means
they
can
compete
with
the
most
basins
in
the
world
in
particular
shale
bp
is
far
from
alone
in
focusing
on
technology
all
big
oil
companies
have
put
a
growing
emphasis
on
digitalisation
to
reduce
costs
following
the
oil
price
collapse
of
in
fact
bp
s
spend
on
r
d
was
the
third
lowest
among
the
world
s
top
publicly
traded
oil
companies
in
at
million
compared
with
exxon
mobil
s
billion
and
royal
dutch
shell
s
and
total
s
budgets
of
over
million
other
majors
have
also
made
advances
italy
s
eni
has
launched
the
world
s
most
powerful
industrial
computer
to
process
seismic
data
for
example
while
france
s
total
is
using
drones
to
carry
out
seismic
mapping
in
dense
forests
such
as
in
papua
new
guinea
however
barclays
analysts
said
in
a
report
last
year
that
bp
and
norway
s
equinor
had
the
most
advanced
deployment
of
technology
among
oil
majors
the
seismic
breakthrough
for
bp
came
when
xukai
shen
tested
a
new
idea
he
had
for
the
fwi
algorithm
in
what
happened
was
magic
the
pieces
came
together
recalled
etgen
we
finally
had
the
right
algorithm
with
the
right
data
set
to
create
the
model
of
the
salt
formation
and
use
the
model
to
remove
bp
says
its
new
seismic
technology
could
save
it
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
exploration
hours
by
pinpointing
the
location
of
the
most
promising
deposits
it
allows
us
to
drill
the
right
wells
drill
wells
at
lower
costs
drill
wells
in
the
best
part
of
the
reservoir
drill
fewer
wells
etgen
said
the
costs
of
the
technology
are
a
fraction
of
bp
s
oil
and
gas
production
budget
of
around
billion
per
year
an
fwi
survey
costs
up
to
million
to
carry
out
while
processing
the
data
costs
up
to
million
etgen
told
reuters
the
annual
spend
on
the
that
runs
the
software
is
about
million
the
companies
that
are
investing
in
technology
are
coming
through
and
winning
the
race
henry
morris
technical
director
at
independent
north
explorer
azinor
catalyst
that
s
where
bp
are
doing
a
good
job
it
s
seeing
through
salt
layers
with
confidence
adds
real
value
and
saves
companies
the
premiums
they
must
pay
to
acquire
resources
through
acquisitions
according
to
bernstein
analysts
with
computing
the
seismic
processing
and
interpretations
are
being
done
in
two
weeks
rather
than
years
as
it
would
have
been
if
they
still
used
century
computers
they
said
investors
should
therefore
expect
more
from
bp
