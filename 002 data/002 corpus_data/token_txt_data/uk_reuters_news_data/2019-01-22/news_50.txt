'a list' climate change firms outperform on stock market -survey
oslo
reuters
apple
l
oreal
and
mitsubishi
electric
are
among
more
than
global
firms
which
scored
top
marks
in
a
ranking
of
corporate
efforts
to
slow
climate
change
many
companies
say
they
are
stepping
up
action
on
climate
change
since
almost
governments
struck
the
paris
climate
agreement
to
phase
out
greenhouse
gas
emissions
this
century
by
shifting
from
fossil
fuels
but
only
two
percent
of
firms
that
submitted
data
made
the
a
list
of
cdp
s
index
including
johnson
johnson
nestle
china
mobile
and
microsoft
cdp
formerly
the
carbon
disclosure
project
said
its
data
showed
the
shares
of
its
index
leaders
tend
to
outperform
on
stock
markets
companies
are
coming
under
increasing
pressure
from
shareholders
to
address
climate
change
cdp
said
the
stoxx
global
climate
leaders
index
based
on
the
cdp
a
list
outperformed
the
stoxx
global
of
major
firms
by
percent
a
year
from
december
to
july
we
think
climate
action
is
a
lead
indicator
of
quality
in
other
areas
especially
sustainability
and
management
dexter
galvin
global
director
of
corporates
and
supply
chains
at
cdp
told
reuters
ahead
of
the
index
publication
on
tuesday
galvin
said
it
was
hard
to
compare
the
results
with
previous
years
due
to
changes
in
the
questions
posed
as
a
result
a
company
that
dropped
off
the
list
was
not
necessarily
performing
worse
he
added
cdp
asks
companies
to
disclose
their
performance
on
climate
change
and
separately
surveys
their
efforts
to
limit
water
use
and
to
protect
forests
in
its
study
which
is
backed
by
more
than
investors
with
assets
of
trillion
and
is
meant
to
spur
efforts
to
protect
the
planet
galvin
said
cdp
would
in
future
be
bolder
in
naming
and
shaming
in
the
report
which
was
issued
to
coincide
with
the
start
of
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
among
examples
of
efforts
made
by
its
a
list
companies
cdp
said
danish
lego
launched
the
first
lego
elements
made
from
plastic
sourced
from
sugar
cane
and
korean
electronics
company
lg
display
had
developed
and
invested
in
more
than
reduction
technologies
