the

united
arab
emirates
has
decided
to
ban
the
use
of
a
type
of
ship
exhaust
cleaner
becoming
the
latest
location
to
impose
restrictions
on
scrubbers
a
port
document
showed
in
recent
months
many
shipping
companies
have
opted
to
fit
scrubbers
onboard
their
ships
ahead
of
major
changes
in
the
use
of
marine
fuel
across
the
world
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
will
prohibit
ships
from
using

sulphur
content
above
percent

with
percent
today
unless
they
are
equipped
with
exhaust
gas
cleaning
systems
known
as
scrubbers
to
clean
up
sulphur
emissions
since
the
imo
s
rules
were
adopted
there
have
been
moves
to
restrict
the
use
of
scrubbers
in
various
jurisdictions
the
other
types
of
scrubber
and
hybrid
are
still
accepted
for
use
in
many
locations
although
scrubbers
prevent
sulphur
emissions
from
ships
escaping
into
the
atmosphere
heavy
metals
and
sulphur
end
up
being
discharged
into
seas
with
washing
