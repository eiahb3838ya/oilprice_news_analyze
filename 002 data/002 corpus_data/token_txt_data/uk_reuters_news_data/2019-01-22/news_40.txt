he
was
truly
ashamed
of
his
government
s
inability
to
clear
air
pollution
that
has
blanketed
seoul
and
parts
of
the
country
for
weeks
and
proposed
an
early
warning
system
with
china
south
korea
often
accuses
china
of
causing
much
of
its
air
pollution
but
china
says
it
is
not
entirely
to
blame
and
south
korea
should
take
more
responsibility
for
its
own
air
quality
the
people
had
to
suffer
greatly
last
week
due
to
an
unprecedented
number
of
days
of
dense
fine
dust
president
moon
told
a
cabinet
meeting
on

i
feel
truly
ashamed
because
we
are
unable
to
clearly
address
the
south
korea
asia
s
fourth
largest
economy
has
been
grappling
with
worsening
air
quality
last
year
the
government
shut
down
five
aging
power
plants
from
march
to
june
in
a
bid
to
reduce
air
pollution
moon
called
for
further
measures
on
tuesday
including
reducing
the
number
of
diesel
cars
on
the
roads
and
modernizing
household
heaters
moon
said
regional
air
pollution
is
a
disaster
that
must
be
resolved
through
creative
efforts
and
cooperation
between
governments
we
know
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
public
concern
because
of
the
fine
dust
coming
from
china
and
because
china
is
also
suffering
from
fine
dust
it
is
necessary
to
strengthen
cooperation
to
drastically
reduce
fine
dust
moon
said
a
senior
chinese
official
acknowledged
on
monday
pollution
was
a
regional
problem
but
that
south
korea
should
do
more
to
solve
its
own
problems
in
large
cities
like
seoul
while
air
quality
in
key
regions
of
china
has
improved
by
more
than
percent
since
concentrations
of
tiny
particles
in
seoul
were
steady
or
rose
slightly
said
liu
bingjiang
of
china
s
atmospheric
pollution
department
of
the
ministry
of
ecology
and
environment
the
experiences
of
many
countries
shows
that
in
the
process
of
treating
atmospheric
pollution
in
a
region
the
local
emissions
treatment
of
large
cities
is
more
important
liu
said
at
a
monthly
briefing
if
we
blame
transmission
effects
and
do
not
face
up
to
our
own
problems
we
will
not
grasp
those
problems
and
miss
the
best
chance
to
solve
air
pollution
he
added
liu
said
china
was
in
close
cooperation
with
regional
neighbors
like
south
korea
and
japan
and
more
studies
were
needed
to
determine
the
interaction
of
pollution
between
cities
a
joint
study
conducted
by
the
space
agency
nasa
and
south
korea
s
national
institute
of
environmental
research
in
found
that
about
percent
of
south
korea
s
pollutants
originated
within
the
country
while
percent
came
from
other
countries
including
percent
from
china
chinese
and
south

met
