shares
and
stock
futures
slipped
on
tuesday
as
pessimism
about
world
growth
drove
investors
away
from
risky
assets
while
sterling
dithered
as
the
latest
plan
for
brexit
appeared
to
come
and
go
with
no

about
percent
markets
were
closed
on
monday
for
a
holiday
so
trading
was
generally
subdued
overnight
however
equity
prices
in
europe
and
latin
america
were
hit
after
data
showed
a
slowdown
in
growth
in
china
the
world
s
second
biggest
economy
adding
to
the
air
of
caution
and
uncertainty
the
international
monetary
fund
trimmed
its
global
growth
forecasts
and
a
survey
showed
increasing
pessimism
among
business
chiefs
as
trade
tensions
loomed
the
gloomy
imf
forecasts
released
on
the
eve
of
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
switzerland
highlighted
the
challenges
facing
policymakers
as
they
tackle
an
array
of
current
or
potential
crises
from
the
trade
war
to
brexit
this
is
now
the
second
imf
downgrade
in
a
row
anz
analysts
said
in
a
note
and
while
there
have
been
some
positive
developments
in
recent
weeks
risks
remain
skewed
towards
weaker
growth
with
a
no
deal
brexit
and
slowdown
in
china
getting
special
between
the
ongoing
negotiations
and
the
uk
s
brexit
impasse
market
sentiment
will
continue
to
be
dominated
by
geopolitics
in
the
near
term
anz
added
in
a
sign
of
risk
aversion
the
australian
dollar
often
used
as
a
liquid
proxy
for
china
investments
nudged
down
to
putting
it
on
track
for
a
third
straight
session
of
losses
sterling
traded
cautiously
around
as
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
refused
to
rule
out
a
brexit
there
are
few
signs
she
can
break
a
deadlock
with
parliament
after
her
brexit
deal
was
rejected
last
week
may
offered
to
tweak
her
defeated
deal
by
seeking
further
concessions
from
the
european
union
on
a
backup
plan
to
avoid
a
hard
border
in
ireland
any
upside
for
sterling
in
the
near
term
may
be
limited
said

peach
uncertainty
would
continue
during
the
extended
negotiations
and
there
is
no
guarantee
that
it
would
last
for
only
a
short
period
of
analysts
said
investors
were
nervous
about
building
positions
in
the
pound
specially
given
the
possibility
of
britain
leaving
the
eu
without
a
deal
the
dollar
held
at
against
the
japanese
yen
while
the
euro
was
near
the
floor
of
its
recent
trading
range
at
against
a
basket
of

the
