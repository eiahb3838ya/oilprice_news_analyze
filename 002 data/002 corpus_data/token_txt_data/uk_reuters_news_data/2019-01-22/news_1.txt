brasileiras
sa
raising
capital
but
whether
that
is
through
privatization
or
another
format
has
not
yet
been
determined
chief
executive
wilson
ferreira
said
on
tuesday
ferreira
told
reuters
he
has
begun
to
discuss
how
to
capitalize
eletrobras
as
the
company
is
known
with
mines
and
energy
minister
bento
albuquerque
but
not
yet
with
economy
minister
paulo
guedes
or
president
jair
bolsonaro
ferreira
said
the
capital
increase
could
be
done
this
year
among
the
options
are
selling
assets
outright
privatization
or
issuing
new
shares
that
would
dilute
the
stake
of
the
state
the
previous
government
tried
that
but
was
not
able
to
get
a
bill
authorizing
the
operation
through
congress
last
year
after
the
new
government
took
office
on
minister
albuquerque
said
that
the
capitalization
process
will
go
ahead
but
he
has
not
given
details
the
decision
on
how
to
do
this
has
not
been
taken
yet
what
is
clear
is
that
the
capitalization
is
necessary
to
increase
the
company
s
capacity
to
invest
ferreira
said
but
he
said
nothing
has
been
decided
on
whether
to
take
up
the
proposal
sent
to
congress
or
some
other
alternative
or
how
much
money
can
be
raised
from
the
capitalization
the
economy
ministry
will
have
to
be
brought
into
the
discussion
