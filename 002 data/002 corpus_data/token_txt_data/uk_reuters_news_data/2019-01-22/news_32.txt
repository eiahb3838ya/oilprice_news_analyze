canada
s
two
major
railways
are
rationing
space
on
trains
traveling
to
the
country
s
biggest
port
and
recently
prioritized
some
commodities
over
others
to
deal
with
congestion
the
latest
indication
of
their
struggle
to
meet
demand
from
new
trade
deals
that
move
prompted
canada
s
transport
regulator
last
week
to
start
an
investigation
into
rail
services
around
port
metro
vancouver
after
shippers
complained
of
discriminatory
treatment
of
certain
commodities
by
canadian
national
railway
cn
and
canadian
pacific
railway
cp
canada
is
a
top
shipper
of
crops
fertilizer
oil
and
pulp
but
has
in
recent
years
needed
government
intervention
to
keep
commodities
moving
from
ordering
railways
to
clear
grain
backlogs
to
alberta
s
crude
oil
curtailments
this
month
due
to
full
pipelines
deals
with
the
european
union
and
pacific
nations
are
boosting
demand
for
commodities
adding
further
strain
to
canada
s
transportation
infrastructure
currently
the
united
states
and
mexico
account
for
at
least
percent
of
canadian
exports
both
railways
last
month
rationed
the
volume
of
traffic
around
vancouver
by
restricting
movement
of
some
commodities
such
as
peas
lentils
pulp
and
paper
according
to
shipper
notices
seen
by
reuters
the
restrictions
called
embargoes
are
usually
a
tool
of
last
resort
for
railways
to
ease
congestion
by
temporarily
limiting
traffic
but
in
december
shippers
allege
that
cn
and
cp
used
them
more
often
than
normal
harming
some
commodity
sellers
more
than
others
in
an
effort
to
push
through
the
maximum
overall
volume
cp
imposed
embargoes
on
three
specific
transloaders
facilities
that
empty
rail
cars
into
containers
for
loading
onto
vessels
these
transloaders
handle
peas
and
lentils
but
were
prevented
from
doing
so
in
december
for
days
at
a
time
said
greg
northey
director
of
industry
relations
at
pulse
canada
the
delays
caused
some
containers
to
miss
their
vessels
triggering
contract
breach
penalties
northey
said
it
was
a
total
mess
he
said
embargoes
also
added
costs
for
pulp
and
paper
producers
who
are
trying
to
bolster
ties
with
asian
buyers
amid
ongoing
tariff
disputes
with
the
united
states
for
a
second
consecutive
year
the
railways
imposed
more
embargo
restrictions
on
pulp
and
paper
than
usual
in
december
leading
to
shipping
delays
according
to
the
forest
products
association
of
canada
whose
members
include
canfor
corp
and
west
fraser
timber
we
can
t
do
business
like
this
if
we
want
to
diversify
markets
said
association
chief
executive
derek
nighbor
it
s
just
a
missed
poor
rail
service
costs
the
forest
products
industry
c
million
million
annually
the
association
said
december
s
problems
cost
mills
as
much
as
a
further
c
million
each
it
said
several
shippers
said
the
transportation
agency
will
be
asked
at
a
hearing
in
late
january
to
consider
whether
the
railways
discriminated
against
shippers
that
fill
manifest
trains
those
carrying
a
variety
of
products
the
investigation
could
also
consider
whether
the
railways
violated
their
common
carrier
obligations
to
haul
a
full
range
of
freight
for
cn
and
cp
the
investigation
raises
the
risk
of
further
regulation
in
an
industry
where
they
already
complain
of
too
much
government
control
in
a
statement
cn
said
the
transportation
agency
s
investigation
should
examine
the
full
supply
chain
and
take
into
account
the
impact
that
rain
and
wind
had
on
operations
late
last
year
cn
said
freight
shipments
are
up
percent
from
november
to
cp
chief
executive
keith
creel
said
he
takes
great
exception
to
cp
being
included
in
the
agency
s
investigation
adding
in
a
statement
that
he
is
not
aware
of
formal
complaints
since
the
railways
embargo
and
permit
system
was
implemented
in
december
to
clear
freight
the
flow
of
cars
to
grain
terminals
has
improved
but
it
is
unclear
how
the
backlog
happened
in
the
first
place
said
wade
sobkowich
executive
director
of
western
grain
elevator
association
it
indicates
that
railways
have
failed
to
invest
in
adequate
capacity
to
move
goods
at
peak
times
