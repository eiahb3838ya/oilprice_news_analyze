pakistan prepares new budget amid balance of payments squeeze
islamabad
reuters
pakistani
finance
minister
asad
umar
is
due
to
announce
a
package
of
measures
to
shore
up
strained
public
finances
in
a
mini
budget
on
wednesday
that
comes
only
months
after
the
government
presented
its
last
finance
plan
in
september
measures
are
expected
to
include
higher
taxes
on
luxury
items
mobile
phones
and
large
cars
as
well
as
cuts
in
import
duty
for
some
machinery
and
raw
materials
imports
to
try
to
boost
local
industry
and
help
exporters
but
the
main
thrust
of
the
package
will
be
on
creating
better
conditions
for
investment
in
an
economy
struggling
from
severe
pressure
on
its
public
finances
and
facing
a
balance
of
payments
crisis
with
foreign
exchange
reserves
sufficient
to
cover
less
than
two
months
of
imports
this
is
not
just
about
taxation
measures
it
is
about
encouraging
investment
whether
in
the
stock
exchange
industry
financial
sector
or
other
said
khaqan
hassan
najeeb
a
senior
adviser
at
the
finance
ministry
with
economic
growth
expected
to
slow
this
year
to
percent
from
percent
in
a
yawning
current
account
deficit
and
a
fiscal
deficit
set
to
hit
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
in
according
to
imf
estimates
pakistan
needs
to
get
control
of
its
public
finances
on
the
fiscal
side
there
s
more
to
be
done
they
really
need
to
find
ways
to
bring
the
fiscal
deficit
down
said
raza
jafri
executive
director
of
research
at
intermarket
securities
since
coming
to
power
in
august
much
of
the
government
s
focus
has
been
in
staving
off
a
balance
of
payments
crisis
and
it
has
opened
talks
with
the
international
monetary
fund
although
there
has
been
no
agreement
so
far
on
the
terms
of
what
would
be
pakistan
s
imf
bailout
since
the
umar
who
was
quoted
earlier
this
month
as
saying
there
was
no
immediate
need
for
an
imf
package
is
due
to
arrive
back
in
pakistan
on
tuesday
from
a
visit
to
qatar
with
prime
minister
imran
khan
the
visit
was
aimed
at
securing
agreement
to
cut
the
price
of
liquefied
natural
gas
from
qatar
and
secure
a
credit
facility
to
defer
payments
on
gas
imports
part
of
a
broader
drive
to
secure
financing
from
sources
other
than
the
imf
an
accord
with
qatar
would
follow
similar
arrangements
with
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
which
have
offered
deals
to
defer
payment
for
oil
imports
in
addition
to
billions
of
dollars
in
loans
high
imports
of
capital
goods
many
related
to
the
china
pakistan
economic
corridor
development
project
part
of
china
s
mammoth
belt
and
road
initiative
as
well
as
strong
demand
for
consumer
goods
and
energy
costs
have
driven
a
wider
current
account
deficit
but
despite
a
sharp
devaluation
of
the
pakistani
rupee
which
has
lost
about
percent
of
its
value
over
the
past
year
and
a
steep
drop
in
oil
prices
over
the
past
three
months
exports
have
been
slow
to
pick
