french
energy
regulator
cre
and
its
spanish
counterpart
cnmc
have
rejected
a
project
by
france
and
spain
s
grid
operators
to
build
a
gas
pipeline
across
the
pyrenees
cre
said
in
a
statement
on
tuesday
the
french
regulator
said
the
million
euro
million
step
interconnector
project
did
not
respond
to
market
needs
and
was
not
sufficiently
mature
to
get
a
from
regulators
reuters
reported
in
april
that
a
report
prepared
for
the
european
commission
had
questioned
the
viability
of
step
which
would
have
been
the
first
part
of
an
billion
euro
midcat
pipeline
project
to
more
than
double
gas
transport
capacity
between
the
two
nations
gas
pipeline
operators
typically
earn
a
fixed
return
on
their
investments
which
can
only
be
charged
to
consumers
if
regulators
consider
the
investment
necessary
cre
said
current
gas
exchange
capacity
between
spain
and
france
was
per
day
in
july
french
grid
operator
terega
owned
by
italy
s
snam
and
spanish
operator
enagas
submitted
a
project
to
boost
that
by
gwh
in
the
france
to
spain
direction
and
by
gwh
in
the
spain
to
france
direction
the
project
had
strong
support
from
european
union
climate
commissioner
miguel
arias
canete
a
spanish
national
who
considers
the
pipeline
would
reduce
europe
s
reliance
on
imported
russian
gas
enagas
operates
a
large
network
of
lng
regasification
plants
on
the
spanish
coast
that
could
help
import
more
gas
from
other
countries
such
as
algeria
qatar
and
the
united
states
but
the
project
has
faced
opposition
from
french
energy
regulator
cre
who
said
shortly
after
the
proposal
that
midcat
would
push
up
consumer
prices
without
improving
security
industry
experts
have
questioned
the
need
for
another
interconnector
arguing
that
existing
pipelines
are
already
even
during
periods
of
high
demand
friends
of
the
earth
said
in
a
statement
that
step
was
a
pipeline
project
and
that
its
rejection
by
regulators
calls
into
question
other
gas
projects
gas
is
a
dangerous
fossil
fuel
which
emits
significant
amounts
of
greenhouse
gases
we
can
t
keep
sinking
taxpayer
billions
into
more
