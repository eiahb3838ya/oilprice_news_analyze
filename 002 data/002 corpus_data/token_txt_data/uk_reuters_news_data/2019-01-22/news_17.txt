china
has
become
a
key
backer
for
power
globally
funding
more
than
a
quarter
of
all
new
plants
being
developed
outside
its
borders
even
as
it
clamps
down
on
the
polluting
fuel
at
home
a
study
published
on
tuesday
said
the
top
destinations
are
bangladesh
vietnam
south
africa
and
pakistan
and
about
a
quarter
of
the
proposed
capacity
would
use
technology
no
longer
allowed
in
china
the
report
by
the
institute
for
energy
economics
and
financial
analysis
ieefa
a
said
china
is
taking
very
forceful
steps
to
slow
down
the
increase
in
power
facilities
in
china
but
is
looking
to
take
that
capacity
and
sell
it
overseas
said
melissa
brown
ieefa
s
energy
finance
consultant
and
an
author
of
the
report
china
the
world
s
biggest
energy
consumer
has
been
investing
heavily
in
alternative
fuels
in
order
to
cut
its
dependence
on
coal
a
major
source
of
smog
as
well
as
carbon
emissions
it
has
closed
down
ageing
mines
and
power
plants
with
the
aim
of
cutting
the
fuel
s
share
of
total
energy
consumption
from
percent
in
to
percent
by
next
year
but
even
as
it
slashes
coal
use
within
its
borders
its
financial
institutions
have
committed
or
offered
funding
of
billion
for
gigawatts
gw
of
power
now
being
developed
outside
the
country
the
report
said
while
overseas
financial
institutions
like
the
world
bank
aim
to
restrict
new
coal
investments
chinese
enterprises
and
policy
banks
are
becoming
lenders
of
last
resort
for
power
it
said
state
firms
facing
caps
on
coal
production
and
targets
to
reduce
consumption
in
regions
have
responded
by
heading
overseas
the
xuzhou
mining
group
is
now
running
projects
in
pakistan
and
bangladesh
after
closing
collieries
in
eastern
china
s
jiangsu
province
china
is
involved
in
nearly
gw
of
planned
capacity
in
bangladesh
and
gw
in
vietnam
the
report
said
adding
that
percent
of
the
gw
of
capacity
was
classified
as
subcritical
technology
no
longer
in
use
at
home
ironically
many
of
the
equipment
types
would
no
longer
be
suitable
for
use
in
china
said
brown
noting
that
many
recipient
countries
have
lower
environmental
standards
and
are
highly
motivated
to
take
investment
in
any
china
brought
its
total
renewable
and
nuclear
generation
capacity
up
to
gigawatts
last
year
raising
its
share
of
total
power
capacity
from
percent
to
percent
in
just
three
years
but
brown
said
china
s
role
in
financing
power
could
overshadow
its
clean
energy
contributions
there
are
a
number
of
countries
that
would
welcome
china
as
a
leading
global
developer
of
renewables
but
what
we
ve
seen
is
that
many
chinese
companies
have
essentially
exported
technology
for
which
there
is
increasingly
no
demand
in
china
