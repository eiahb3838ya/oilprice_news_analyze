will
study
the
possibility
of
converting
the
gigawatts
gw
cordemais
coal
power
generators
to
burn
biomass
due
to
its
importance
in
guaranteeing
security
of

the
energy
ministry
said
on
tuesday
president
emmanuel
macron
s
government
plans
to
phase
out
electricity
production
from
france
s
remaining
power
plants
by
as
part
of
measures
to
curb
carbon
emissions
and
global

the

also
plans
to
reduce
france
s
dependence
on
nuclear
power
which
accounts
for
over
percent
of
french
electricity
needs
while
boosting
the
development
of
greener
energies
french
power
grid
operator
rte
has
warned
that
the
plan
to
shut
down
some
coal
and
nuclear
generators
could
leave
france
a
net
exporter
of
electricity
in
europe
largely
dependent
on
neighbors
during
peak
demand
periods
particularly
in
winter
anxious
to
guarantee
french
electricity
supply
the

edf
are
studying
a
project

ministry
said
in
a
statement
it
added
that
the
cordemais
conversion
project
would
only
be
considered
under
the
strict
condition
that
power
production
from

site
would
be
necessary
to
guarantee
french
security
of

after
the
ministry
said
the
study
would
look
at
the
environmental

the
current
series
of

call
