when
wardell
davis
landed
work
with
a
norfolk
virginia
shipbuilding
contractor
in
the
fall
of
he
felt
lucky
then
years
old
with
no
high
school
diploma
davis
had
for
years
bounced
between
jobs
the
contractor
he
says
promised
better
pay
for
grueling
labor
blasting
the
hulls
of
navy
ships
with
coarsely
ground
coal
particles
to
remove
rust
and
paint
he
recalls
the
fog
of
dust
created
as
workers
fired
the
crushed
coal
a
residue
from
power
plants
against
the
ship
bottoms
from
hoses
moving
through
the
tented
blasting
area
in
respirators
and
protective
suits
a
year
later
davis
found
a
better
job
with
a
plumbing
and
heating
company
he
became
a
father
but
still
found
time
to
hit
the
ymca
most
days
for
a
swim
a
lifelong
passion
then
in
he
began
struggling
to
hold
his
breath
under
water
soon
he
couldn
t
hold
it
at
all
he
was
dogged
by
a
persistent
cough
sweats
and
nausea
in
doctors
at
norfolk
s
sentara
hospital
found
a
black
foreign
material
in
his
lungs
davis
successfully
filed
a
disability
claim
for
interstitial
fibrotic
disease
caused
by
exposure
to
abrasive
blasting
four
years
and
three
biopsies
later
davis
survives
on
a
single
lung
unable
to
work
he
lives
on
disability
payments
and
has
brought
suit
against
abrasives
manufacturers
and
safety
equipment
providers
he
alleges
failed
to
protect
him
they
deny
responsibility
for
his
failing
health
if
i
ever
would
have
thought
that
this
would
have
happened
to
me
i
would
ve
never
ever
worked
there
he
told
reuters
his
words
punctuated
by
coughs
davis
was
one
of
an
estimated
shipyard
and
construction
workers
who
regulators
say
are
exposed
each
year
to
beryllium
a
toxic
carcinogenic
element
laced
through
the
coal
waste
often
used
in
abrasive
blasting
grits
these
workers
lie
at
the
heart
of
a
regulatory
drama
unfolding
behind
the
trump
administration
s
push
to
relax
safety
rules
it
deems
burdensome
to
businesses
just
after
the
election
the
trump
administration
and
its
congressional
allies
began
moving
to
unravel
key
provisions
of
a
federal
rule
issued
in
the
last
days
of
the
obama
presidency
that
sharply
limited
workplace
exposure
to
beryllium
and
required
certain
industries
to
carefully
monitor
health
risks
beryllium
inhalation
has
long
been
known
to
cause
lung
cancer
and
berylliosis
a
debilitating
potentially
fatal
respiratory
illness
yet
efforts
to
set
an
updated
workplace
exposure
standard
had
been
stymied
for
decades
by
debates
over
what
the
new
exposure
limit
should
be
the
obama
rule
was
based
on
a
compromise
developed
by
labor
and
industry
stakeholders
the
trump
administration
has
left
the
new
beryllium
exposure
limits
intact
but
in
june
it
announced
plans
to
exempt
shipbuilding
and
construction
operations
from
the
rule
s
ancillary
provisions
which
require
air
quality
testing
new
workplace
hygiene
measures
and
employee
health
monitoring
for
illnesses
that
decision
scheduled
to
take
effect
in
june
would
remove
the
estimated
workers
from
the
protections
a
government
analysis
shows
a
occupational
safety
and
health
administration
analysis
found
that
the
measures
now
being
supplanted
could
have
saved
lives
estimating
they
would
avert
four
deaths
a
year
in
the
shipbuilding
and
construction
sectors
the
protections
would
cost
affected
industries
nearly
million
a
year
or
about
per
worker
according
to
the
assessment
that
analysis
a
mandated
component
of
the
process
put
the
savings
to
society
from
averted
deaths
and
illnesses
at
nearly
million
yielding
a
net
economic
benefit
of
about
million
a
year
without
the
benefits
of
the
air
testing
and
health
monitoring
requirements
the
exposure
limits
for
beryllium
are
meaningless
said
david
michaels
who
headed
osha
for
seven
years
under
obama
if
there
s
no
air
testing
or
disease
surveillance
there
s
no
way
to
know
how
much
exposure
workers
are
getting
or
who
may
be
getting
sick
said
michaels
who
now
teaches
at
the
george
washington
university
school
of
public
health
at
the
department
of
labor
which
oversees
osha
spokeswoman
amy
louviere
said
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
comment
for
this
article
because
the
process
is
ongoing
the
white
house
did
not
respond
to
interview
requests
the
trump
administration
s
plan
to
weaken
the
beryllium
rule
offers
a
case
study
in
the
renewed
power
businesses
can
wield
in
the
regulatory
process
in
this
case
emails
and
government
documents
reviewed
by
reuters
show
a
small
industry
the
manufacturers
of
abrasive
blasting
grit
used
a
modest
lobbying
campaign
and
congressional
allies
to
unwind
a
rule
a
decade
in
the
making
never
in
osha
s
history
has
the
agency
decided
to
roll
back
worker
protections
for
a
carcinogen
deborah
berkowitz
osha
s
former
chief
of
staff
wrote
the
agency
on
behalf
of
the
national
employment
law
project
a
nonprofit
workers
rights
group
the
rule
s
critics
say
its
provisions
for
construction
and
shipyard
operations
are
unnecessary
because
workers
in
those
environments
are
already
protected
by
other
osha
safety
requirements
extra
costs
unfairly
fall
on
businesses
they
say
osha
officials
have
a
mentality
that
there
s
no
such
thing
as
too
much
safety

that

issues
previously
a
chief
economist
for
several
republican
congressional
offices
brannon
says
the
beryllium
rule
s
construction
and
shipyard
provisions
reflect
a
broken
regulatory
system
that
tends
to
discount
business
impacts
like
lost
jobs
or
greater
compliance
representative
bobby
scott
the
new
chairman
of
the
house
committee
on
education
and
the
workforce
said
in
response
to
reuters
questions
that
the
panel
will
investigate
whether
osha
has
valid
economic
or
scientific
rationale
to
eliminate
the
beryllium
rule
s
shipyard
and
construction
provisions
the
virginia
democrat
noted
that
osha
has
routinely
included
such
provisions
in
other
health
standards
including
a
rule
on
toxic
silica
dust
by
killing
those
provisions
for
beryllium
he
said
the
trump
administration
has
created
a
double
political
push
more
than
a
dozen
lawmakers
ultimately
took
up
the
fight
to
get
the
ancillary
provisions
stripped
from
the
rule
all
are
republicans
mostly
from
districts

representative
bradley
byrne
of
alabama
a
member
of
the
education
and
workforce
committee
who
chaired
its
subcommittee
on
workforce
protections
until
the
democrats
took
over
the
house
of
representatives
this
month
byrne
opposed
the
provisions
out
of
concern
they
would
kill
jobs
at
gulf
coast
abrasives
manufacturing
companies
spokesman
seth
morrow
said
any
additional
costs
could
result
in
layoffs
he
said
in
a
march
letter
to
administration
officials
byrne
noted
that
the
abrasive
blasting
industry
employs
more
than
people
the
beryllium
rule
was
the
last
major
action
osha
took
as
the
obama
administration
wound
to
a
close
it
was
published
january
just
days
before
trump
was
sworn
in
lobbying
for
its
repeal
began
almost
immediately
on
march
the
new
administration
announced
it
would
delay
implementing
the
beryllium
rule
in
light
of
substantive
concerns
raised
about
its
effect
on
the
shipyard
and
construction
industries
said
a
notice
published
in
the
federal
register
and
signed
by
osha
administrator
dorothy
dougherty
dougherty
who
retired
from
the
agency
in
june
declined
to
comment
osha
provided
heavily
redacted
versions
of
her
emails
to
reuters
which
sought
them
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
the
agency
has
failed
to
respond
to
reuters
foia
requests
filed
more
than
nine
months
ago
for
emails
from
other
senior
officials
involved
in
the
decision
dougherty
s
notice
referenced
just
one
name
as
the
source
of
osha
s
concerns
about
the
ancillary
provisions
alabama
s
byrne
on
march
byrne
had
sent
a
letter
to
the
labor
department
and
office
of
management
and
budget
director
mick
mulvaney
whose
agency
oversees
all
regulatory
proposals
by
federal
agencies
urging
them
to
scrap
the
beryllium
rule
s
ancillary
provisions
for
shipyard
and
construction
operations
the
letter
sprang
from
meetings
with
two
abrasive
manufacturers
in
his
district
spokesman
morrow
said
both
of
the
manufacturers
the
mobile
abrasives
inc
and
harsco
minerals
were
members
of
an
industry
group
the
abrasive
blasting
manufacturers
alliance
that
paid
lobbying
firms
nixon
peabody
and
squire
patton
boggs
to
try
to
block
the
safety
requirements
the
abma
s
opposition
centered
on
how
the
rule
would
affect
the
market
for
the
abrasives
its
members
produce
in
comments
submitted
to
the
federal
register
by
squire
patton
boggs
the
alliance
said
the
rule
would
incentivize
employers
to
switch
from
abrasives
to
alternative
blasting
materials
without
any
safety
benefit
harsco
referred
questions
to
the
abma
which
declined
comment
byrne
s
letter
was
submitted
the
same
day
as
those
comments
it
included
passages
that
were
nearly
identical
to
what
the
alliance
said
in
some
cases
word
for
word
other
language
in
byrne
s
letter
was
nearly
verbatim
to
an
article
published
by
a
scientist
employed
by
harsco
in
an
industry
news
publication
five
days
earlier
former
patton
boggs
senior
partner
mark
cowan
a
lobbyist
who
served
on
trump
s
labor
department
transition
team
also
became
involved
on
march
cowan
who
served
as
deputy
head
of
osha
under
president
reagan
attended
a
meeting
at
the
labor
department
where
squire
patton
boggs
lobbyists
asked
agency
lawyers
about
osha
s
plans
for
the
beryllium
rule
cowan
later
wrote
an
essay
arguing
that
thanks
to
existing
safety
rules
the
workers
were
never
threatened
by
beryllium
exposure
to
begin
neither
cowan
nor
squire
patton
boggs
replied
to
interview
requests
gop
opposition
mobilizes
hours
after
osha
announced
the
beryllium
rule
delay
on
march
byrne
sent
another
letter
to
the
agency
this
one
was
organized
with
virginia
republican
robert
wittman
of
a
house
subcommittee
overseeing
naval
programs
and
infrastructure
and
by
other
congressional
republicans
from
the
house
and
senate
the
letter
thanked
osha
for
the
delay
but
urged
it
to
issue
a
new
beryllium
rule
that
did
not
include
the
ancillary
safety
provisions
for
the
shipyard
and
construction
industries
that
same
day
byrne
s
campaign
received
in
contributions
from
the
associated
builders
contractors
an
industry
group
that
supports
scrapping
the
ancillary
provisions
byrne
wittman
and
others
who
signed
the
letter
have
drawn
financial
support
for
years
from
the
contractors
and
other
industry
groups
with
a
stake
in
the
rule
including
the
shipbuilders
council
of
america
which
donated
to
each
lawmaker
in
the
election
cycle
morrow
said
the
two
groups
had
made
other
donations
to
byrne
and
that
there
was
no
correlation
between
the
donations
and
beryllium
rule
asked
about
the
donations
shipbuilders
council
of
america
president
matthew
paxton
said
worker
safety
is
the
top
priority
of
our
industry
and
that
the
council
is
part
of
a
safety
alliance
with
osha
the
associated
builders
contractors
did
not
respond
to
interview
requests
on
may
harsco
employees
and
cowan
attended
another
meeting
at
the
white
house
s
office
of
management
and
budget
seventeen
days
later
osha
announced
a
second
delay
in
the
rule
s
implementation
and
on
june
osha
announced
its
proposal
to
revoke
the
safety
requirements
entirely
virginia
s
wittman
joined
byrne
in
raising
concerns
because
he
believed
the
initial
rule
could
cause
potential
job
loss
his
office
told
reuters
osha
his
office
said
needed
to
reassess
the
mobile
abrasives
chief
financial
officer
matthew
serda
told
reuters
he
did
not
fear
losing
jobs
instead
he
said
he
sought
byrne
s
help
to
lift
the
frivolous
requirements
for
the
shipyard
and
construction
industries
because
they
would
disincentivize
those
companies
from
buying
coal
slag
that
could
compel
manufacturers
to
switch
to
costlier
abrasives
such
as
glass
and
garnet
the
abrasive
blasting
industries
are
already
heavily
regulated
serda
said
twenty
years
ago
when
workers
were
wearing
bandanas
yes
it
may
have
been
necessary
nowadays
they
re
wearing
all
kinds
of
protective
equipment
he
said
i
just
have
not
seen
anyone
contracting
beryllium
disease
from
coal
slag
in
the
years
i
ve
been
working
around
when
osha
initially
announced
plans
to
revise
the
beryllium
rule
it
said
its
previous
analyses
had
not
accounted
for
compliance
with
personal
protective
equipment
and
housekeeping
provisions
already
required
at
shipyards
and
construction
sites
that
argument
ran
against
decades
of
osha
protocol
which
held
that
if
significant
risk
of
exposure
to
a
hazardous
substance
can
not
be
completely
eliminated
ancillary
provisions
are
necessary
beyond
existing
protective
equipment
said
jordan
barab
former
deputy
assistant
secretary
of
osha
under
obama
morrow
the
spokesman
for
byrne
said
there
are
no
known
instances
of
illness
in
the
shipbuilding
and
construction
industries
that
point
comes
with
an
asterisk
no
one
is
officially
checking
for
such
illnesses
say
dozens
of
occupational
health
specialists
and
worker
safety
advocates
interviewed
by
reuters
the
symptoms
of
berylliosis
shortness
of
breath
a
persistent
cough
fatigue
are
similar
to
those
of
some
other
diseases
as
a
result
diagnosing
the
malady
requires
a
specific
blood
test
that
just
a
few
laboratories
in
the
country
perform
said
one
of
the
labs
the
national
jewish
health
advanced
diagnostics
laboratories
they
cost
about
per
person
the
lab
says
the
nonprofit
center
for

research
and
training
a
research
arm
of
north
america
s
building
trade
unions
that
has
partnered
with
osha
to
educate
construction
workers
about
health
hazards
has
researched
beryllium
exposure
in
a
series
of
studies
it
found
airborne
beryllium
concentrations
of
more
than
times
the
new
permissible
exposure
limit
during
coal
slag
abrasive
blasting
operations
other
studies
by
groups
including
the
national
institute
for
occupational
safety
and
health
found
health
problems
in
various
construction
trades
lee
newman
a
beryllium
researcher
at
the
university
of
colorado
denver
said
he
has
treated
construction
trades
workers
who
did
demolition
work
and
went
on
to
develop
berylliosis
berylliosis
definitely
afflicts
such
workers
he
said
to
say
otherwise
is
to
ignore
the
published
science
on
the
subject
newman
said
confounding
illness
shipyard
and
construction
workers
have
sought
treatment
for
lung
ailments
through
the
association
of
occupational
and
environmental
clinics
a
network
of
some
clinics
specializing
in
laborer
illnesses
and
injuries
so
many
of
these
cases
probably
were
beryllium
disease
but
nobody
s
ever
going
to
know
said
association
executive
director
kathy
kirkland
since
occupational
clinics
are
equipped
to
treat
common
worker
ailments
but
not
to
test
workers
blood
for
beryllium
specifically
it
is
impossible
to
know
how
many
cases
were
misdiagnosed
as
sarcoidosis
or
other
pulmonary
diseases
at
the
newport
news
shipyard
a
beryllium
education
campaign
is
underway
driven
by
local
union
leaders
such
as
allen
harville
former
safety
chairman
of
united
steelworkers
local
at
a
recent
town
hall
harville
explained
the
berylliosis
symptoms
to
a
hall
of
shipyard
workers
wardell
davis
said
he
wishes
his
employer
had
told
him
about
the
health
risks
posed
by
coal
slag
and
given
him
a
chance
to
get
his
blood
tested
for
beryllium
years
ago
he
now
prepares
for
more
tests
while
pushing
ahead
on
the
lawsuit
he
filed
alleging
abrasives
manufacturers
and
safety
equipment
providers
failed
to
protect
him
his
suit
pending
in
newport
news
circuit
court
seeks
damages
from
more
than
a
dozen
companies
temporary
laborers
like
davis
who
don
t
belong
to
a
union
are
most
likely
to
encounter
beryllium
exposure
said
chris
trahan
cain
director
of
safety
and
health
at
north
america
s
building
trades
unions
large
unionized
construction
companies
are
shifting
away
from
coal
abrasives
in
favor
of
alternatives
cain
said
smaller
companies
that
often
employ
immigrant
workers
remain
likelier
to
use
them
my
concern
is
that
it
s
the
most
vulnerable
workers
