a
plan

drew
a
rebuke
from
founders
of
the
company
it
merged
with
months
ago
who
said
they
would
challenge
the
energy
firm
s
board
in
an
upcoming
shareholder
ballot
eqt
became
one
of
the
largest
producers
when
it
completed
its
with
rice
energy
in
november
despite
its
new
scale
eqt
s
share
price
has
lagged
since
the
merger
a
situation
which
spurred
in
december
two
of
rice
energy
s
founders
toby
and
derek
rice
to
call
for
changes
in
response
eqt
said
it
would
focus
on
generating
free
cash
flow
that
could
be
returned
to
shareholders
with
eqt
chief
executive
robert
mcnally
telling
reuters
it
was
highly
likely
it
would
seek
to
buy
back
shares
in
the
near
shareholder
reaction
to
the
plan
was
broadly
negative
with
eqt
shares
ending
percent
lower
the
sentiment
was
matched
by
the
two
rice
brothers
who
said
in
a
statement
that
eqt
s
plan
does
not
address
the
fundamental
concerns
being
raised
and
they
will
ask
shareholders
to
replace
board
members
and
install
toby
rice
as
ceo
a
spokeswoman
for
eqt
did
not
respond

request
for
comment
on
the
rice
statement
however
according
to
a
letter
sent
to
the
brothers
seen
by
reuters
the
eqt
board
said
while
it
was
to
new
ideas
and
adding
management
expertise
it
questioned
the
experience
and
suitability
of
the
brothers
to
be
appointed
ceo
and
to
the
board
the
core
schism
is
over
how
the
company
develops
its
assets
the
rice
brothers
insist
eqt
s
poor
stock
performance
since
the
merger
has
been
because
the
current
management
has
not
fulfilled
the
firm
s
potential
while
eqt
insist
the
siblings
projections
are
inflated
and
based
on
outdated
market
conditions
under
its
plan
eqt
expects
to
generate
around
billion
of
accumulated
adjusted
free
cash
flow
over
the
next
five
years

savings
an
initiative
to
trim
a
further
percent
of
costs
across
its
development
program

as
an

decline
in

rice
brothers
have
insisted
they
can

an
additional
million
to
million
free
