the
billionaire
brexit
supporter
who
revolutionised
vacuum
cleaners
with
his
bagless
technology
is
moving
his
head
office
to
singapore
from
britain
to
be
closer
to
his
company
s
markets
dyson
s
company
said
the
move
to
singapore
where
it
will
build
its
new
electric
car
was
not
driven
by
britain
s
looming
departure
from
the
european
union
or
tax
implications
with
much
of
its
product
development
remaining
in
south
west
england
the
inventor
has
become
one
of
britain
s
entrepreneurs
creating
a
company
from
an
insight
that
a
cyclone
could
collect
household
dust
better
than
a
bag
chief
executive
jim
rowan
said
the
manufacturer
of
air
purifiers
hairdryers
and
cleaner
lauded
by
politicians
as
a
british
success
story
was
a
global
technology
company
with
percent
of
its
sales
outside
britain
our
growth
rate
in
asia
has
doubled
most
other
places
in
the
world
over
recent
years
he
said
adding
that
more
than
half
of
its
profit
came
from
the
region
and
the
move
was
aimed
at
future
proofing
dyson
rowan
said
the
company
which
broke
through
the
billion
pound
barrier
for
annual
profit
in
was
moving
to
be
near
its
manufacturing
centres
and
the
markets
where
it
was
seeing
the
biggest
demand
it
allows
us
to
make
sure
we
will
be
putting
our
best
efforts
to
secure
those
opportunities
as
well
as
keeping
an
eye
on
those
investments
especially
ev
electric
vehicles
and
batteries
he
told
reporters
on
tuesday
there
would
be
a
negligible
difference
to
its
tax
payments
as
a
result
said
rowan
who
is
already
based
in
singapore
where
the
corporate
tax
rate
is
percent
it
is
percent
in
britain
but
is
set
to
fall
to
percent
in
he
said
he
would
be
joined
there
by
other
senior
executives
including
the
company
s
chief
financial
officer
once
the
paperwork
to
was
complete
rowan
said
the
chinese
market
had
grown
in
four
years
from
a
to
a
market
of
a
similar
size
to
the
united
states
james
dyson
came
out
in
favour
of
brexit
days
before
the
vote
when
he
said
britain
could
be
about
billion
pounds
better
off
each
year
if
it
left
the
european
union
but
with
only
weeks
before
brexit
other
manufacturers
are
warning
of
huge
damage
if
no
divorce
deal
is
struck
rowan
did
not
foresee
see
any
issues
relating
to
the
movement
of
goods
for
dyson
if
your
supply
chain
is
in
asia
and
you
are
manufacturing
in
the
philippines
singapore
and
malaysia
then
obviously
you
don
t
get
badly
affected
with
those
changes
he
said
dyson
which
has
engineers
and
scientists
working
on
its
new
electric
car
and
other
products
said
it
was
still
expanding
its
research
and
engineering
operation
in
britain
it
reported
earnings
before
interest
tax
depreciation
and
amortisation
ebitda
of
billion
pounds
billion
in
on
turnover
up
percent
to
billion
pounds
dyson
also
said
on
tuesday
it
had
hired
executive
roland
krueger
from
infiniti
motor
company
and
nissan
motor
co
to
oversee
its
automotive
project
we
expect
to
be
able
to
go
in
and
disrupt
yet
another
industry
using
bespoke
dyson
technology
and
innovation
rowan
said
in
october
it
said
it
would
build
its
electric
car
in
singapore
because
it
said
it
was
close
to
suppliers
and
asian
markets
for
the
vehicle
which
is
due
to
launch
