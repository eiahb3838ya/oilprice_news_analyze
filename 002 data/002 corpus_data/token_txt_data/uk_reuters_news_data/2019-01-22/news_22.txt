for
delivering
fuel

vessels

resort

a
risky
manoeuvre

the

while

during
stormy
conditions
russia

just
three
locations
in
the

all

a
source
in
the
ministry
said
all
transfers
especially
of
such
dangerous
cargo
moreover
during
stormy
weather
and
in
the
winter
raises
big
questions
the
source
said
the
ministry
source
said
they
did
not
know
whether
the
tanker
had
been
barred
from
the
port
but
added
that
doing
so
was
within
the
rights
of
the
owners
of
the
gas

terminal

the
ministry
said
the
ships
are
still
on
fire
and
no
attempts
are
being
made
to
put
out
the
blaze
due
to
rough
sea
conditions
a
ministry
spokesman
said
refinitiv
data
showed
milano
shipping
as
the
owner
of
the
venice
and
maestro
shipping
of
the
maestro
the
venice
was
recently
renamed
as
the
candy
one
industry
source
said
but
two
traders
separate
to
the
industry
sources
told
reuters
that
both
vessels
were
ultimately
owned
by
one
turkish
company
milenyum
denizcilik
gemi
milenyum
was
placed
on
the
sanctions
list
in
for
arranging
the
shipment
of
liquefied
petroleum
gas
and
gasoil
to
syrian
government
controlled
areas
phone
numbers
for
milenyum
and
milano
shipping
listed
online
were
not
answered
on
last
year
the
treasury
department
added
nine
russian
and
iranian
individuals
and
companies
on
its
sanctions
list
for
participating
in
the
shipment
of
petroleum
to
syria
it
also
issued
an
advisory
note
warning
of
the
potential
sanctions
risk
for
any
entities
involved
in
such
shipments
which
listed
ships
including
the
maestro
and
venice
as
having
delivered
oil
to
syria
between
and
reuters
reported
in
december
that
both
the
maestro
and
venice
continued
operations
after
the
announcement
and
regularly
entered
temryuk
port
according
to
refinitiv
data
after
the
reuters
report
the
maestro
was
barred
from
using
the
port
s
gas
terminal
by
its
owners
and
thereby
denied
access
to
the
port
the
two
industry
sources
said
but
the
venice
now
known
as
candy
continued
to
dock
at
temryuk
refinitiv
data
showed
there
s
every
indication
that
some
black
scheme
was
going
on
one
of
the
industry
sources
said
why
else
would
the
venice
load
up
with
gas
and
then
immediately
transfer
it
onto
another
tanker
the
source
said
adding
that
the
venice
was
likely
to
have
been
permitted
access
to
the
port
as
it
had
changed
its
name
to
candy
since
the
sanctions
note
since
the
announcement
the
has
travelled
to
near
the
lebanese
and
syrian
coastline
on
three
occasions
refinitiv
data
showed
on
tuesday
while
the
maestro
has
made
the
same
journey
once
the
data
does
not
show
at
which
port
the
vessels
finally
docked
they
appear
to
turn
around
before
reaching
the
coast
vessels
wishing
to
conceal
their
location
have
been
known
to
switch
off
their
transponders
and
go
dark
though
ships
are
allowed
to
switch
off
their
signalling
systems
in
certain
circumstances
for
example
for
reasons
of
security
such
instances
are
relatively
limited
and
rare
richard
meade
managing
editor
of
lloyd
s
list
intelligence
in
london
said
both
vessels
weren
t
showing
up
as
live
despite
being
fairly
close
to
receivers
meade
said
this
certainly
would
raise
red
flags
in
terms
of
anybody
looking
at
the
accident
or
criminal
the
maestro
s
signalling
system
last
reported
its
location
on
saturday
when
it
was
located
off
the
coast
of
turkey
in
the
black
sea
according
to
refinitiv
data
but
on
monday
it
was
near
the
kerch
strait
a
body
of
water
between
crimea
and
southern
russia
which
connects
the
azov
sea
to
the
black
sea
there
it
met
the
venice
which
had
left
temryuk
port
on
sunday
morning
with
a
fresh
cargo
of
liquefied
petroleum
gas
an
industry
source
said
after
attempting
to
transfer
the
highly
flammable
fuel
both
ships
were
on
fire
