rome
reuters
deputy
prime
minister
matteo
salvini
stoking
a
war
of
words
between
rome
and
paris
said
on
tuesday
that
france
did
not
want
to
bring
calm
to
libya
because
its
energy
interests
there
clashed
with
those
of
italy
relations
between
italy
and
france
traditionally
close
allies
have
grown
frosty
since
the
league
and
movement
formed
a
coalition
last
year
and
took
aim
at
french
president
emmanuel
macron
a
source
in
macron
s
office
dismissed
the
latest
attack
as
ludicrous
while
italian
prime
minister
giuseppe
conte
sought
to
ease
the
escalating
tensions
saying
relations
between
the
two
countries
remained
strong
despite
a
string
of
recent
rows
on
monday
france
summoned
italy
s
ambassador
after
salvini
s
fellow
deputy
prime
minister
luigi
di
maio
accused
paris
of
creating
poverty
in
africa
and
generating
mass
migration
to
europe
salvini
backed
up
di
maio
saying
france
was
looking
to
extract
wealth
from
africa
rather
than
helping
countries
develop
their
own
economies
and
pointed
particularly
to
libya
which
has
been
in
turmoil
since
a
uprising
in
that
overthrew
strongman
muammar
gaddafi
in
libya
france
has
no
interest
in
stabilising
the
situation
probably
because
it
has
oil
interests
that
are
opposed
to
those
of
italy
salvini
told
canale
tv
station
a
french
diplomatic
source
said
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
salvini
had
made
such
comments
and
that
it
was
probably
because
he
felt
he
had
been
upstaged
by
di
maio
the
source
added
that
the
accusation
was
baseless
and
reiterated
that
french
efforts
in
libya
were
aimed
at
stabilising
the
country
preventing
the
spread
of
terrorism
and
curbing
the
migration
flows
italy
s
eni
and
france
s
total
have
separate
joint
ventures
in
libya
but
eni
s
ceo
claudio
descalzi
denied
in
a
newspaper
interview
last
year
that
there
was
any
conflict
between
the
two
firms
in
the
north
african
state
salvini
is
head
of
the
league
while
di
maio
leads
both
are
campaigning
hard
for
european
parliamentary
elections
in
may
and
are
eager
to
show
they
have
broken
with
the
consensual
politics
of
and
parties
the
two
men
have
repeatedly
targeted
neighbouring
france
and
accused
macron
of
doing
nothing
to
help
handle
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
mainly
african
migrants
who
have
reached
italy
from
libya
in
recent
years
asked
about
the
latest
diplomatic
spat
salvini
said
on
tuesday
france
has
no
reason
to
get
upset
because
it
pushed
away
tens
of
thousands
of
migrants
at
the
french
border
abandoning
them
there
as
though
they
were
beasts
we
won
t
take
any
lessons
on
humanity
from
a
french
presidential
source
said
populist
forces
in
italy
and
elsewhere
were
looking
to
undermine
countries
like
france
and
germany
which
wanted
to
strengthen
the
european
union
the
european
elections
will
be
the
place
where
we
confront
those
as
you
can
see
again
today
with
the
ludicrous
comments
from
the
italian
government
who
seek
to
destroy
the
european
project
and
the
partnership
the
source
said
looking
to
prevent
a
diplomatic
rupture
the
italian
prime
minister
issued
a
statement
praising
relations
with
paris
saying
that
rome
merely
wanted
a
debate
within
europe
on
difficult
issues
such
as
immigration
this
row
does
not
call
into
question
our
historic
friendship
with
france
nor
with
the
french
people
this
relationship
remains
strong
and
steady
in
spite
of
any
political
disputes
