reuters
carmaker
bentley
is
on
track
to
be
profitable
this
year
but
a
brexit
puts
that
at
fundamental
risk
its
boss
told
reuters
adding
that
the
chance
of
britain
leaving
the
eu
on
march
with
a
deal
now
seemed
fairly
britain
the
world
s
fifth
largest
economy
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
the
globe
s
biggest
trading
bloc
in
days
but
the
government
s
negotiated
deal
was
rejected
by
lawmakers
leaving
open
the
possibility
of
a
disorderly
brexit
the
car
industry
which
employs
over
people
in
the
country
has
warned
that
any
tariffs
and
customs
checks
would
hit
firms
such
as
bentley
s
parent
company
volkswagen
as
it
both
exports
from
britain
and
imports
vehicles
and
components
bentley
which
made
a
million
loss
in
the
first
nine
months
of
last
year
is
undergoing
a
turnaround
under
new
boss
adrian
hallmark
who
said
the
group
is
on
course
to
return
to
the
black
but
that
plan
could
be
undone
depending
on
the
form
brexit
takes
it
s
brexit
that
s
the
killer
he
told
reuters
if
we
ended
up
with
a
hard
brexit
that
would
hit
us
this
year
because
we
do
have
a
potential
to
get
beyond
to
do
the
it
would
put
at
fundamental
risk
our
chance
of
becoming
like
other
carmakers
the
brand
is
taking
steps
to
prepare
including
building
up
stocks
of
imported
parts
from
two
days
to
days
and
building
a
higher
proportion
of
cars
for
some
markets
in
the
next
few
months
we
will
build
more
cars
for
china
or
the
than
we
would
normally
do
in
the
period
hallmark
said
hallmark
said
he
believed
the
company
was
prepared
and
did
not
plan
to
temporarily
halt
output
after
britain
leaves
the
bloc
on
march
as
planned
by
fellow
automakers
mini
and
honda
carry
more
stock
and
it
s
a
few
million
pounds
per
year
if
we
had
to
stop
production
then
that
would
be
a
similar
value
per
day
he
said
hallmark
said
were
three
possible
outcomes
on
brexit
a
deal
by
march
which
has
a
fairly
low
probability
no
deal
with
a
degree
of
unrest
and
chaos
or
an
extension
to
britain
s
eu
membership
german
automakers
bmw
daimler
and
volkswagen
made
around
percent
of
the
million
cars
sold
in
britain
last
year
with
less
than
percent
of
the
total
built
in
the
country
in
britain
was
the
largest
single
export
market
for
german
automakers
which
sold
new
cars
there
or
percent
of
their
overall
global
exports
of
the
top
automotive
plants
which
export
the
highest
proportions
of
their
output
to
britain
seven
are
in
germany
including
ford
in
cologne
psa
in
eisenach
volkswagen
in
ingolstadt
and
mercedes
in
bremen
according
to
data
compiled
by
lmc
automotive
britain
s
brexit
negotiators
have
pointed
to
the
car
industry
as
an
example
of
where
the
eu
would
lose
out
if
there
were
new
trade
barriers
a
source
close
to
the
matter
told
reuters
last
year
bentley
based
in
the
northern
english
town
of
crewe
recorded
a
percent
decline
in
sales
to
vehicles
hit
by
a
delay
in
the
arrival
of
its
continental

model
in
china
sales
rose
percent
asked
whether
the
company
might
move
some
bentley
production
out
of
britain
to
overcome
any
brexit
hit
hallmark
said
he
did
not
see
that
happening
in
the
medium
term
you
can
never
say
never
but
there
s
no
intention
of
moving
what
we
have
to
other
facilities
because
of
brexit
he
said
when
we
look
at
new
products
are
they
under
question
of
course
they
are
like
every
product
that
is
in
there
was
under
question
we
have
to
be
competitive
