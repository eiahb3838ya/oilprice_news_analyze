plans

last

experts

if

speeds

germany
s
manufacturing
industry
is
crucial
to

economic
powerhouse
and
holds
considerable
political
sway
and
the
bdi
dihk
and
bda
urged
berlin
to
provide
a
subsidy
of
at
least
billion
euros
a
year
towards
network

prosperity
largely
depends

association
managing
director
steffen
kampeter
said
adding
that
jobs
would
be
at
risk
from
an
overhasty
exit
from
coal
we
are
in
our
year
of
an
economic
uptrend
but
if
power
becomes
unaffordable
we
can
not
retain
a
functioning
industrial
basis
altmaier
said
at
the
event
which
was
organized
by
business
daily
handelsblatt
altmaier
laid
out
several
ways
in
which
berlin
could
insulate
manufacturers
from
the
increased
costs
associated
with
its
commitment
to
reduce
carbon
dioxide
emissions
this
included
extending
refunds
for
surcharges
on
green
electricity
to
companies
something
altmaier
said
he
expected
to
be
looked
upon
favorably
at
a
european
commission
level
as
germany
unlike
its
european
union
neighbors
plans
to
exit
all
of
its
nuclear
power
and
much
of
its
coal
simultaneously
prices
for
consumers
would
also
be
protected
if
germany
allowed
more
power
imports
including
from
the
nordic
countries
installed
mechanisms
to
reduce
power
demand
at
times
of
low
supply
and
enabled
more
digital
network
technologies
he
added
flexible
gas
turbines
could
also
play
a
bigger
role
in
power
generation
in
former
coal
mining
regions
altmaier
said
adding
that
the
extra
demand
for
gas
could
be
supplied
from
russia
via
the
politically
sensitive
nord
stream
pipeline
or
met
through
new
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
import
terminals
altmaier
has
invited
potential
suppliers
including
from
the
united
stated
to
a
summit
in
february
to
discuss
the
lng
option
but
he
stressed
that
berlin
would
not
be
pressured
to
give
up
the
nord
stream
project
which
washington
opposes
euros
