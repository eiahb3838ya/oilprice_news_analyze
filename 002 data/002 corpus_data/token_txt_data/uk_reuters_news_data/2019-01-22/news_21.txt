james
dyson
the
billionaire
brexit
supporter
who
revolutionised
vacuum
cleaners
with
his
bagless
technology
is
moving
his
corporate
office
and
tax
registration
to
singapore
from
britain
to
be
closer
to
his
fastest
growing
markets
the
company
said
the
move
from
britain
was
not
driven
by
the
looming
departure
from
the
european
union
or
any
tax
implications
it
already
manufacturers
products
in
asia
and
will
build
its
new
electric
car
in
singapore
much
of
its
product
development
will
remain
in
south
west
england
chief
executive
jim
rowan
said
the
group
was
seeing
the
biggest
demand
for
its
products
like
air
purifiers
and
hairdryers
as
well
as
cleaners
in
asia
it
allows
us
to
make
sure
we
will
be
putting
our
best
efforts
to
secure
those
opportunities
as
well
as
keeping
an
eye
on
those
investments
especially
ev
electric
vehicles
and
batteries
he
said
rowan
who
is
already
based
in
singapore
will
be
joined
by
other
senior
executives
he
said
the
change
in
the
company
s
overall
tax
bill
would
be
negligible
as
a
result
of
the
move
and
the
company
was
still
expanding
its
research
and
engineering
operation
in
britain
the
move
comes
as
dyson
said
its
annual
profit
had
broken
through
the
billion
pound
barrier
for
the
first
time
driven
by
strong
demand
in
china
and
other
asian
countries
