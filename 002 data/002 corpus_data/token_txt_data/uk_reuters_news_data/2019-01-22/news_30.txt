pessimism
about
global
growth
drove
down
world
shares
and
commodity
markets
on
tuesday
and
left
investors
seeking
refuge
in
the
dollar
government
bonds
and
gold
the
international
monetary
fund
s
warning
of
a
darkening
outlook
on
monday
after
china
s
confirmation
of
its
slowest
growth
rate
in
nearly
years
and
amid
more
over
brexit
continued
to
weigh
on
the
mood
european
shares
had
followed
asia
into
the
red
with
disappointing
earnings
from
swiss
bank
ubs
also
adding
extra
gloom
after
europe
s
banking
sector
saw
nearly
percent
wiped
off
its
value
last
year
in
its
world
economic
outlook
report
the
imf
predicted
the
global
economy
would
grow
at
percent
in
and
percent
in
down
and
percentage
point
respectively
from
last
october
s
forecasts
the
downgrade
mainly
reflected
signs
of
weakness
in
europe
with
germany
hurt
by
new
car
emission
rules
italy
under
market
pressure
due
to
rome
s
recent
budget
standoff
with
the
european
union
and
brexit
hanging
over
the
bloc
as
well
we
have
seen
a
little
bit
of
a
pull
back
but
whether
it
s
the
imf
growth
downgrade
or
china
related
is
neither
here
nor
there
said
cmc
markets
senior
analyst
michael
hewson
he
pointed
to
the
strong
and
sudden
rebound
that
markets
like
germany
s
dax
have
seen
since
the
end
of
december
as
well
as
other
major
global
indexes
we
are
at
the
top
end
of
the
range
for
this
year
and
given
the
global
uncertainty
investors
are
probably
taking
the
view
that
it
is
probably
wise
to
take
a
bit
of
profit
off
the
futures
markets
were
pointing
to
a
weak
start
for
the
united
states
later
with
falls
of
percent
for
the
s
p
and
nearly
percent
for
the
nasdaq
seen
another
development
nibbling
at
sentiment
was
news
that
the
united
states
plans
to
proceed
with
the
formal
extradition
from
canada
of
chinese
tech
giant
huawei
executive
meng
wanzhou
meng
who
is
also
the
daughter
of
huawei
s
founder
ren
zhengfei
was
arrested
in
early
december
at
the
request
of
the
united
states
over
alleged
violations
of
sanctions
on
iran
she
was
released
on
bail
and
is
due
in
court
in
vancouver
on
asia
s
overnight
losses
had
been
led
by
chinese
shares
with
the
index
off
percent
japan
s
nikkei
skidded
percent
too
while
hong
kong
and
sydney
closed
down
and
percent
in
another
sign
of
risk
aversion
the
australian
dollar
often
used
as
a
liquid
proxy
for
china
investments
eased
percent
to
putting
it
on
track
for
a
third
straight
session
of
losses
the
same
worries
had
also
pushed
the
new
zealand
dollar
down
for
a
seventh
session
and
copper
which
is
used
in
everything
from
electrical
wiring
and
water
pipes
to
cars
drifting
lower
in
the
metals
markets
the
dollar
held
at
a
near
high
as
investors
sought
the
relative
safety
of
the
currency
that
kept
the
euro
pegged
back
at
and
reapplied
pressure
on
the
main
emerging
market
currencies
following
a
decent
start
to
the
year
for
most
of
them
sterling
was
a
shade
firmer
at
after
data
showed
british
workers
pay
growth
hit
a
new
high
and
employment
had
grown
by
much
more
than
expected
in
the
three
months
to
the
end
of
november
otherwise
traders
were
still
waiting
to
see
whether
uk
prime
minister
theresa
may
can
push
her
brexit
plans
through
the
country
s
bitterly
divided
parliament
may
had
offered
tweaks
on
monday
by
seeking
further
concessions
from
the
european
union
on
a
backup
plan
to
avoid
a
hard
border
between
the
province
of
northern
ireland
and
the
irish
republic
but
she
had
also
refused
to
rule
out
leaving
the
eu
at
the
end
of
march
without
any
deal
any
upside
for
sterling
in
the
near
term
may
be
limited

uncertainty
would
continue
during
the
extended
negotiations
and
there
is
no

that
it
would
last

a
