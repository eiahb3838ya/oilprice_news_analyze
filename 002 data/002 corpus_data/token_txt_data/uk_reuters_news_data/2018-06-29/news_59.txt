i
think
there
s
quite
a
lot
of
fairly
erratic
behaviour
when
it
comes
to
the
perception
of
this
threat
of
the
trade
war
said
jim
mccafferty
head
of
equity
research
asia
at
nomura
trump
has
a
habit
of
making
pronouncements
erratically
and
markets
are
reacting
quite
strongly
to
after
falling
to
fresh
lows
on
thursday
shares
in
china
rebounded
friday
while
analysts
said
the
jump
reflected
technical
factors
it
was
helped
by
news
that
beijing
would
ease
foreign
investment
curbs
on
sectors
including
banking
automobiles
heavy
industry
and
agriculture
the
country
s
central
bank
also
said
on
thursday
that
it
would
ensure
that
market
liquidity
remained
reasonably
the
index
gained
percent
and
the
shanghai
composite
index
was
percent
higher
despite
the
gains
on
friday
the
and
shanghai
composite
are
the
world
s
two
major
indexes
this
year
and
are
set
for
their
worst
monthly
performances
since
january
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
index
rose
percent
despite
the
bump
on
friday
analysts
downplayed
the
impact
of
china
s
relaxing
of
investment
curbs
on
broader
trade
issues
this
may
not
be
enough
to
ease
current
tensions
with
the
calling
for
much
greater
market
access
and
fairer
competition
for
foreign
enterprises
the
list
affirms
china
s
stance
that
opening
up
will
occur
in
its
own
timeframe

analysts
said
in
a
note
elsewhere
in
the
region
investors
remained
focused
on
concerns
over
global
trade
as
the
ambassador
to
china
said
washington
was
not
convinced
that
china
is
willing
to
make
fast
progress
on
trade
the
administration
is
due
to
activate
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
worth
billion
on
july
which
is
expected
to
prompt
a
response
from
beijing
the
trade
war
issue
is
coming
up
to
a
critical
junction
because
of
that
impending
implementation
of
those
tariffs
said
shane
oliver
chief
economist
and
head
of
investment
strategy
at
amp
capital
in
sydney
while
the
scope
of
the
initial
tariffs
is
limited
investors
just
worry
that
tariffs
are
going
to
lead
to
more
retaliation
and
then
escalation
he
said
the
dollar
index
which
measures
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
six
currencies
fell
percent
to
the
currency
has
risen
in
recent
weeks
helped
by
the
federal
reserve
s
move
to
raise
interest
rates
in
june
and
expectations
of
further
hikes
this
year
the
ongoing
drip
feed
of
high
us
interest
rates
is
creating
consternation
said
oliver
obviously
it
s
pushing
up
the
us
dollar
and
putting
downward
pressure
on
asian
currencies
generally
including
the
renminbi

that
could
well
have

under

from
