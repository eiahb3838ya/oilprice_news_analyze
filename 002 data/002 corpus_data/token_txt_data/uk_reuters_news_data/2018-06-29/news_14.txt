libya
s
national
oil
corporation
noc
said
on
friday
it
expects
to
declare
force
majeure
on
loadings
from
the
eastern
ports
of
zueitina
and
hariga
from
july
raising
losses
in
output
from
a
power
struggle
over
oil
exports
to
bpd
this
step
will
have
to
be
taken
due
to
insufficient
storage
capacity
and
because
the
libyan
national
army
lna
general
command
has
prevented
legitimate
allocations
being
loaded
by
blocking
vessel
entry
to
ports
the
noc
said
in
a
statement
the
move
would
cause
an
additional
output
cut
of
barrels
per
day
bpd
increasing
total
losses
from
disruption
at
eastern
ports
to
bpd
or
million
in
daily
revenue
the
noc
said
earlier
this
month
fighting
between
the
lna
and
rival
factions
shut
down
the
ports
of
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
reducing
production
by
around
bpd
after
the
lna
regained
those
two
terminals
it
announced
it
would
hand
control
of
all
eastern
ports
and
oilfields
to
a
parallel
noc
based
in
the
eastern
city
of
benghazi
raising
the
prospect
of
prolonged
disruption
to
libya
s
national
production
which
was
previously
more
than
one
million
bpd
noc
benghazi
said
it
was
ordering
port
workers
not
to
load
tankers
that
it
had
not
authorised
holding
up
loadings
booked
by
noc
tripoli
at
zueitina
and
hariga
from
thursday
the
noc
in
tripoli
which
is
internationally
recognised
under
security
council
resolutions
said
blockages
at
the
ports
may
force
the
sarir
refinery
to
cease
operations
which
would
restrict
local
fuel
supplies
it
said
that
noc
subsidiaries
arabian
gulf
oil
company
agoco
and
zueitina
oil
co
had
taken
steps
to
limit
any
pipeline
damage
that
could
result
from
limited
storage
capacity
noc
calls
upon
the
lna
general
command
alongside
whom
it
has
previously
worked
in
the
national
interest
to
end
the
blockade
the
noc
statement
said
the
impact
of
the
standoff
to
the
national
deficit
is
considerable
