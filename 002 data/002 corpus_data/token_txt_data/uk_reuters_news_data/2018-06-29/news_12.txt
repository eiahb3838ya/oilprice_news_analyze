pompeo
has
stressed
to
china
the
importance
of
continued
enforcement
of
sanctions
on
north
korea
to
press
it
to
give
up
its
nuclear
weapons
after
warning
of
signs
of
backsliding
by
beijing
the
state

said
pompeo
had
spoken

his

goal
of
the
complete
verifiable
and
irreversible
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
pompeo
reiterated
that
north
korea
would
have
a
bright
future
if
it
denuclearised
and
emphasized
the
continued
importance
of
full
enforcement
of
all
relevant
un
security
council
resolutions
related
to
north
korea
the
department
said
in
a
statement
it
said
this
was
especially
important
when
it
came
to
preventing
north
korea
s
illegal
export
of
coal
and
imports
of
refined
petroleum
through
transfers
prohibited
by
the
united
nations
president
donald
trump
who
held
an
unprecedented
summit
with
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
on
june
to
try
to
persuade
him
to
give
up
a
nuclear
weapons
programme
that
threatens
the
united
states
urged
continued
sanctions
efforts
by
beijing
last
week
and
said
the
border
between
china
and
north
korea
was
getting
a
little
weaker
officials
have
expressed
concern
that
recent
international
engagement
with
pyongyang
could
lead
countries
to
relax
sanctions
pressure
pompeo
told
a
senate
hearing
this
week
he
had
seen
modest
backsliding
by
china
north
korea
s
neighbour
and
main
trading
partner
which
trump
has
courted
on
the
nuclear
issue
even
while
threatening
a
major
trade
war
with
beijing
we
have
observed
china
not
enforcing
control
over
their
areas
as
vigorously
as
they
were
six
or
months
ago
pompeo
said
in
april
the
security
council
blacklisted
dozens
of
ships
and
shipping
companies
over
oil
and
coal
smuggling
by
north
korea
including
five
based
in
china
on
wednesday
japan
s
kyodo
news
agency
said
tokyo
had
alerted
the
about
a
suspected
transfer
incident
on
june
involving
a
north
korean
tanker
in
the
east
china
sea
pompeo
also
spoke
with
south
korean
foreign
minister
kang
on
thursday
to
discuss
the
next
steps
on
engagement
with
north
korea
the
state
department
said
it
said
they
agreed
on
the
need
to
maintain
pressure
until
north
korea
denuclearises
on
thursday
the
financial
times
quoted
officials
as
saying
that
pompeo
plans
to
travel
to
north
korea
next
week
for
talks
but
the
state
department
has
declined
to
confirm
this
pompeo
said
last
week
he
likely
would
go
back
to
north
korea
before
too
terribly
long
to
try
to
flesh
out
commitments
made
at
the
meeting
trump
has
been
criticized
by
security
analysts
for
agreeing
a
joint
statement
in
his
summit
with
kim
that
gave
no
details
on
how
or
when
north
korea
which
has
rejected
unilateral
disarmament
might
surrender
its
nuclear
weapons
