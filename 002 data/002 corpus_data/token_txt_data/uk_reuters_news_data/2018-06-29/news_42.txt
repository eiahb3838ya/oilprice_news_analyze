world
stocks
enjoyed
a
strong
bounce
on
friday
with
european
shares
recovering
from
a
turbulent
week
of
selling
as
investors
fears
of
higher
barriers
to
trade
came
closer
to
becoming
reality
msci
s
index
of
world
stocks
rose
percent
by
gmt
its
strongest
gain
in
three
weeks
but
its
second
quarter
was
still
set
to
be
in
the
red
as
investors
priced
in
tariffs
set
to
be
implemented
next
week
the
administration
is
due
to
activate
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
worth
billion
on
july
which
is
expected
to
prompt
a
response
from
beijing
european

rallied
strongly
with
the
stoxx
up
percent
and
germany

up
percent
stock
futures
also
rose
to
percent
though
they
briefly
spiked
lower
after
axios
reported
that
president
donald
trump
has
repeatedly
told
aides
he
wants
to
withdraw
from
the
world
trade
organization
it
was
the
latest
sign
of
investors
heightened
sensitivity
to
any
signs
of
deepening
divides
over
trade
tariff
disputes
have
already
mauled
assets
from
the
chinese
yuan
to
european
autos
stocks
and
wiped
trillion
off
the
value
of
world
stocks
since
june
the
euro
jumped
after
leaders
at
an
eu
summit
reached
an
agreement
on
migration
rising
percent
to
that
eased
a
threat
to
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
ruling
coalition
over
the
issue
the
outcome
of
the
summit
tells
us
something
about
the
severity
of
the
situation
said
jan
von
gerich
chief
analyst
at
nordea
in
helsinki
i
m
not
confident
it
will
solve
the
underlying
issues
but
there
was
a
fear
that
the
summit
would
fail
and
we
could
get
a
collapse
of
the
german
government
so
that
risk
premium
is
being
priced
out
he
said
while
asian
stocks
rose
the
chinese
yuan
suffered
its
worst
month
on
record
losing
percent
against
the
dollar
in
june
as
investors
pulled
money
from
a
market
likely
to
suffer
from
higher
barriers
to
trade
the
chinese
yuan
traded
as
low
as
to
the
dollar
on
friday
its
lowest
since
november
as
investors
speculated
china
may
seek
to
devalue
its
currency
to
compensate
for
higher
tariffs
we
continue
to
believe
that
the
yuan
movements
are
largely
reflecting
em
fx
movements
and
are
not
a
sign
of
a
concerted
effort
to
devalue
said
bbh
currency
strategists
despite
gains
on
friday
the

shanghai
composite
are
the
world
s
major
indexes
this
year
in
strong
contrast
to
the
yuan
the
dollar
was
set
for
its
strongest
quarterly
gains
since
helped
by
the
federal
reserve
s
move
to
raise
interest
rates
in
june
and
expectations
of
further
hikes
this
year
the
dollar
index
edged
down
percent
to
on
the
day
as
the
euro
rose
and
the
greenback
was
up
percent
against
the

at
european
bonds
diverged
with
the
eu
summit
migration
agreement
pushing
germany

up
while

fell
to
a
low
the
yield
on
benchmark
treasury

held
steady
at
percent
and
the
yield
curve
widened
slightly
to
basis
points
some
investors
see
its
flattening
as
a
sign
recession
may
be
around
the
corner
intensifying
trade
tariff
fears
contrasted
with
a
still
strong
picture
of
the
global
economy
and
robust
company
earnings
growth
our
view
for
this
year
has
been
that
asset
markets
would
likely
underperform
the
real
economy
as
peaking
growth
momentum
tighter
financial
conditions
higher
inflation
and
more
volatility
would
act
as
a
drag
on
valuations
even
as
eps
trends
remain
solid
