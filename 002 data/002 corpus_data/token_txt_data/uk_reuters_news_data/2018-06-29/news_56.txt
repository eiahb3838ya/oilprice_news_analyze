explainer-trans-korea gas pipeline project reappears, but challenges remain

the
and
much
derided
gas
pipeline
project
is
back
on
the
agenda
buoyed
by
hopes
north
and
south
korea
can
make
peace
if
realized
it
would
be
a
pipeline
for
south
korea
lacking
its
own
energy
resources
or
pipelines
to
regions
with
gas
south
korea
has
been
shipping
the
fuel
in
on
tankers
as
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
based
on
trade
data
and
average
lng
prices
in
that
cost
south
korea
around
billion
in
with
lng
prices
rising
this
year
s
tab
will
likely
be
even
bigger
with
relations
between
north
and
south
warming
albeit
from
levels
the
idea
of
constructing
a
km
mile
long
pipeline
to
bring
russian
gas
through
north
korea
to
the
south
s
industrial
hubs
has
been
revived
the
project
is
now
part
of
south
korea
s
new
northern
policy
south
korean
president
moon
and
his
russian
counterpart
vladimir
putin
last
week
agreed
to
strengthen
energy
cooperation
as
north
korea
s
neighbours
push
for
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
korea
gas
corp
kogas
and
russian
state
gas
company
gazprom
will
conduct
a
joint
pipeline
study
according
south

ministry

the
renewed
enthusiasm
the

remains
riddled

estimating
pipeline
development
costs
is
notoriously
difficult
with
most
projects
ending
up
far
above
initial
estimates
land
pipelines
in
europe
and
north
america
of
similar
length
have
cost
between
billion
to
develop
still
piped
gas
tends
to
be
cheaper
than
lng
due
to
the
cost
of
liquefaction
by
the
producer
and
regasification
by
the
importer
what
s
more
relying
entirely
on
lng
imports
exposes
south
korea
s
industry
to
a
volatile
market
prone
to
price
spikes
should
shipping
lanes
ever
get
interrupted
south
korea
would
even
risk
running
out
of
gas
assuming
relations
with
the
north
normalise
and
remain
good
tapping
russia
s
enormous
reserves
would
bring
a
steady
flow
of

to

the
pipeline
was
included
in
a
memorandum
of
understanding
between
kogas
and
gazprom
the
plan
was
to
supply
million
tonnes
of
russian
gas
annually
over
years
from
vladivostok
into
north
korea
and
on
to
the
south
starting
from
but
the
agreement
fell
apart
after
the
death
of
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
il
and
as
north
korea
advanced
it
nuclear
weapons
programme
said
park
professor
of
energy
policy
at
korea
polytechnic
university
the
risk
of
handing
north
korea
the
power
to
interrupt
supplies
to
the
south
were
deemed
too
big
but
as
we
re
heading
in
the
direction
of
peace
the
likelihood
of
the
gas
pipeline
has
increased
said
park
critics
however
also
point
to
disputes
between
russia
ukraine
and
the
european
union
over
pipeline
supplies
and
fees
which
showed
moscow
s
willingness
to
use
its
gas
as
a
political
tool
beyond
political
risk
the
biggest
hurdle
is
sanctions
which
block
joint
ventures
with
north
korean
firms
prohibit
financial
transactions
with
north
korea
and
forbid
sales
and
purchases
of
commodities
president
donald
trump
has
said
sanctions
on
north
korea
would
remain
in
place
until
it
is
because
of
the
conflict
in
ukraine
there
are
also
and
european
sanctions
against
russia
preventing
western
firms
from
participating
in
russian
oil
and
gas
projects
should
all
obstacles
be
cleared
the
pipeline
could
be
completed
within
three
years
according
to
south
korea
s
posco
research
institute
to
sweeten
the
deal
for
north
korea
which
suffers
from
chronic
electricity
shortages
a
power
station
could
be
built
there
north
korea
can
also
benefit
by
receiving
transit
fees
or
having
gas
infrastructure
said
kim
a
senior
research
fellow
at
energy
think
tank
korea
energy
economics
institute
based
on
comparable
european
pipelines
transit
fees
for
north
korea
would
be
around
million
annually
according
to
park
despite
the
project
s
improving
prospects
critics
say
it
would
be
safer
to
import
more
gas
from
south
korea
s
most
powerful
ally
the
united
states
