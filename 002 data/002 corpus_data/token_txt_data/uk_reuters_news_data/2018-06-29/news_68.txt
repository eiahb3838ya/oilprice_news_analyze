inc
to
rebuild

line
oil

angering
environmentalists
but
offering
hope
to
western
canadian
oil
producers
that
have
struggled
to
move
crude
oil
to
refiners
the
minnesota
public
utilities
commission
s
decision
clears
the
final
major
hurdle
pending
possible

its
aging
corroded

in
western
canada
to
wisconsin

enbridge
closed
up
percent
in

the
commission
also
approved
a
route
that
closely
follows
enbridge
s
preference
and
will
take
line
over
a
new
corridor
for
part
of
its
path
the
certificate
of
need
has
conditions
including
that
enbridge
make
a
financial
guarantee
to
clean
up
any
environmental
damage
and
that
it
remove
at
landowners

pipeline
that

refiners
in

and
surrounding
states
say

necessary
to

shouts
from
native
americans
and
environmental
activists
interrupted
the
meeting
shame
on
you
you
cowards
one
woman
shouted
before
breaking
into
tears
environmental
groups
and
some
indigenous
communities
oppose
the
project
over
concerns
about
spills
and
impact
on
tribal
wild
rice
harvesting
areas
what
they
have
done
to
us
today
is
egregious
said
winona

director
of
honor
the
earth
activist
group
they
have
gotten
their
standing
rock
we
will
do
everything
that
is
needed
to
stop
this
the
standing
rock
tribe
led
opposition
in
to
the
dakota
access
pipeline
in
north
dakota
one
of
the
most
bitterly
contested
energy
projects
in
years
it
was
eventually
built
the
coalition
of
line
opponents
is
likely
to
formally
request
that
the
commission
reconsider
its
approval
said
joe
plumer
lawyer
for
white
earth
nation
business
and
labor
groups
say
the
billion
project
of
which
billion
would
be
spent
in
minnesota
will
create
jobs
and
tax
revenue
it
s
going
to
give
everybody
a
real
boost
said
bob
schoneberger
who
runs
a
piping
contractor
business
in
duluth
minnesota
enbridge
chief
executive
al
monaco
said
in
a
statement
that
he
was
pleased
with
the
commission
s
decisions
and
said
the
project
s
cost
was
materially
unchanged
he
said
he
continues
to
expect
the
rebuilt
pipeline
to
begin
service
in
the
second
half
of
line
which
began
service
in
operates
at
half
its
capacity
its
replacement
would
allow
it
to
return
to
approved
capacity
of
barrels
per
day
that
pipeline
is
an
accident
waiting
to
happen
said
commissioner
dan
lipschultz
it
feels
like
a
gun
to
our
head
that
compels
us
to
approve
a
new
line
but
the
gun
is
real
and
it
s
several
commissioners
voiced
doubts
that
demand
for
crude
oil
and
refined
products
such
as
gasoline
would
grow
enough
to
warrant
the
pipeline
but
enbridge
s
rationing
of
demand
from
oil
shippers
for
space
on
line
was
more
convincing
of
a
need
to
rebuild
said
chairwoman
nancy
lange
the
rebuilt
line
will
follow
the
existing
pipeline
path
partway
through
minnesota
before
veering
south
to
bypass
leech
lake
reserve
and
avoid
a
need
to
shut
down
the
pipeline
for
up
to
one
year
during
construction
the
path
of
a
short
stretch
near
fond
du
lac
reserve
will
be
determined
by
negotiations
between
the
tribe
and
enbridge
tribes
in
the
area
had
said
enbridge
s
preferred
route
was
the
worst
of
numerous
options
fond
du
lac
lawyer
seth
bichler
told
the
commission
that
the
tribes
preferred
a
longer
route
to
the
south
that
would
avoid
more
sensitive
land
recognized
parties
including
enbridge
environmental
and
indigenous
groups
have
days
from
the
time
a
written
order
is
issued
likely
in
a
couple
of
weeks
to
ask
the
commission
to
reconsider
if
such
an
application
is
denied
a
party
can
then
appeal
to
minnesota
s
appeals
court
line
also
requires
additional
permits
from
local
state
and
federal
levels
minnesota
governor
mark
dayton
said
in
a
statement
approvals
are
by
no
means
assured
