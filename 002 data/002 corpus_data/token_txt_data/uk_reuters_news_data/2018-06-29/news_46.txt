bp holds millions of barrels of oil off china as demand falters
reuters
four
supertankers
chartered
by
energy
major
bp
have
been
held
up
or
delayed
off
china
s
east
coast
over
the
last
two
months
unable
to
fully
discharge
oil
as
slowing
demand
from
the
country
s
private
refiners
starts
to
impact
global
markets
two
of
the
four
very
large
crude
carriers
vlccs
are
still
off
shandong
province
holding
half
their
cargoes
of
angolan
crude
oil
and
another
is
headed
back
there
from
south
korea
according
to
trade
flow
data
in
thomson
reuters
eikon
and
two
shipping
sources
who
track
these
vessels
it
s
not
clear
why
the
tankers
have
had
so
much
trouble
offloading
all
their
oil
or
if
bp
had
first
secured
buyers
for
the
million
barrels
worth
more
than
million
at
current
market
prices
that
was
loaded
onto
the
vessels
out
of
africa
bp
has
declined
to
comment
on
the
matter
what
is
apparent
is
that
the
fortunes
of
china
s
independent
refiners
often
called
teapots
have
turned
for
the
worse
amid
escalating
global
trade
tensions
rising
crude
oil
prices
an
oversupplied
domestic
fuel
market
and
tighter
government
tax
scrutiny
either
it
s
because
of
lower
run
rates
curbing
teapots
buying
or
the
buyers
are
having
problems
paying
said
an
executive
with
a
western
trading
house
while
an
executive
at
an
independent
shandong
refiner
said
the
market
is
bad
weak
demand
as
plants
come
under
policy
headwinds
with
the
tax
rules
biting
into
both
executives

to
be
named

they

exports
it
is
not
unusual
for
producers
like
bp
to
ship
cargoes
before
finding
a
buyer
but
having
cargoes
orphaned
for
two
months
is
less
common
several
oil
traders
and
shippers
said
paying
for
supertankers
each
half
a
kilometre
miles
long
to
wait
in
open
seas
to
unload
is
costly
as
well
although
it
is
not
known
at
what
rate
bp
chartered
the
four
vessels
shippers
estimate
the
daily
charter
rate
for
a
vlcc
is
now
about
a
day
so
four
chartered
vlccs
sitting
idle
for
a
month
would
cost
bp
around
million
bp
declined
to
comment
on
the
cost
of
having
the
tankers
waiting
off
china
to
unload
oil
several
traders
and
shippers
said
bp
was
unlikely
the
only
seller
caught
off
guard
by
the
slowdown
in
demand
and
the
teapots
troubles
although
all
said
stranded
cargoes
of
this
size
and
duration
is
rare
among
the
four
ships
the
texas
has
been
held
up
the
longest
it
discharged
part
of
its
angolan
crude
load
in
at
qingdao
and
was
slated
to
offload
the
rest
of
its
cargo
at
rizhao
another
port
in
shandong
shortly
after
instead
the
texas
has
been
anchored
off
the
coast
until
this
week
when
it
discharged

on
thursday
