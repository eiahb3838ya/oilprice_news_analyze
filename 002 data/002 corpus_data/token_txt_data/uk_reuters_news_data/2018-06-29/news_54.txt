world
stocks
enjoyed
a
strong
bounce
on
friday
as
a
recovery
in
asian
markets
spread
to
european
shares
after
a
turbulent
week
of
selling
as
investors
fears
of
higher
barriers
to
trade
came
closer
to
becoming
reality
msci
s
index
of
world
stocks
rose
percent
by
gmt
its
strongest
gain
in
three
weeks
but
its
second
quarter
was
still
set
to
be
in
the
red
as
investors
priced
in
tariffs
that
are
set
to
be
implemented
next
week
the
administration
is
due
to
activate
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
worth

european

the

at

reached

the
outcome
of
the
summit
tells
us
something
about
the
severity
of
the
situation
said
jan
von
gerich
chief
analyst
at
nordea
in
helsinki
i
m
not
confident
it
will
solve
the
underlying
issues
but
there
was
a
fear
that
the
summit
would
fail
and
we
could
get
a
collapse
of
the
german
government
so
that
risk
premium
is
being
priced
out
he
said
while
asian
stocks
rose
the
chinese
yuan
suffered
its
worst
month
on
record
losing
percent
against
the
dollar
in
june
as
investors
pulled
money
from
a
market
likely
to
suffer
from
higher
barriers
to
trade
the
chinese
yuan
traded
as
low
as

on

its
lowest
since

around

chinese
shares
rebounded
from
lows
helped
by
news
that
beijing
would
ease
foreign
investment
curbs
on
sectors
including
banking
automobiles
heavy
industry
and
agriculture
but
despite
friday
s
gains
the

shanghai
composite
are
the
world
s
major
indexes
this
year
in
strong
contrast
to
the
yuan
the
dollar
was
set
for
its
strongest
quarterly
gains
since
helped
by
the
federal
reserve
s
move
to
raise
interest
rates
in
june
and
expectations
of
further
hikes
this
year
the
dollar
index
edged
down

the

widened
slightly

points
many
investors
see
its
flattening
to
record
lows
as
a
sign
recession
may
be
around
the
corner
intensifying
trade
tariff
fears
contrasted
with
a
still
strong
picture
of
the
global
economy
and
robust
company
earnings
growth
our
view
for
this
year
has
been
that
asset
markets
would
likely
underperform
the
real
economy
as
peaking
growth
momentum
tighter
financial
conditions
higher
inflation
and
more
volatility
would
act
as
a
drag
on
valuations
even
as

remain
solid
