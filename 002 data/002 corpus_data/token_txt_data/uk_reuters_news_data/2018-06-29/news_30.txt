nordic power surge will not deter facebook's data centre plans
oslo

a
surge
in
power
prices
in
the
nordic
countries
will
not
deter
facebook
from
looking
at
building
data
centres
in
the
region
a
company
spokeswoman
said
sweden
and
norway
have
traditionally
had
low
electricity
prices
making
them
attractive
locations
for
data
centres
that
big
digital
companies
need
for
their
operations
microsoft
recently
announced
plans
to
build
two
data
centres
in
norway
and
facebook
last
month
decided
to
expand
its
data
centre
in
sweden
s
northern
city
of
lulea
strengthening
its
nordic
operations
but
power
prices
in
sweden
and
norway
are
now
double
those
of
as
inflows
of
water
to
hydropower
reservoirs
are
expected
to
decline
this
year
facebook
spokeswoman
camilla
nordsted
said
we
take
a
view
towards
our
investments
and
the
ingredients
that
make
them
she
said
the
company
would
not
be
affected
by
unusual
power
price
levels
in
the
region
as
facebook
had
signed
a
power
purchase
agreement
ppa
with
three
new
wind
farms
in
norway
the
ppa
term
provides
the
financial
certainty
necessary
for
the
projects
to
be
financed
constructed
and
operated
she
said
in
june
power
prices
in
norway
surged
above
euros
per
megawatt
hour
double
year
on
year
but
the
price
is
only
one
of
the
variables
facebook
is
considering
supportive
state
and
local
partners
a
site
good
access
to
fibre
and
power
access
to
renewable
energy
a
strong
pool
of
talent
for
construction
and
operations
staff
are
important
things
to
consider
nordsted
said
facebook
is
working
on
evaluating
a
number
of
potential
new
sites
for
its
operations
that
it
aims
to
power
with
energy
nordsted
said
but
she
declined
to
identify
specific
plans
at
this
stage
outside
the
united
states
facebook
currently
has
or
has
planned
data
centres
in
ireland
sweden
and
denmark
according
to
data
published
by
the
company
norway
and
sweden
recently
lowered
their
data
centre
taxes
to
attract
more
investments
in
the
region
which
is
rich
in
power
from
renewable
energy
sources
such
as
hydropower
dams
and
wind
farms
