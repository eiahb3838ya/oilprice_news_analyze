on

investors
said
it
has
not
been
a
huge
news
day
in
the
probably
some
of

is
a
snap
back
based
on
the
recent
down
markets
that
we
ve
had
said
curtis
holden
senior
investment
officer
at
tanglewood
total
wealth
management
earlier
the
stock
market
briefly
dipped
on
a
report
by
the
axios
news
website
that
indicated
president
donald
trump
was
keen
for
the
to
withdraw
from
the
world
trade
organization
the
market
recovered
after
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
told
fox
business
network
the
report
was
wrong
the
axios
report
cited
people
involved
in
talks
with
trump
the
market
s
wobbling
was
a
reminder
of
heightened
investor
sensitivity
to
remarks
or
developments
the
markets
are
very
much
subject
to
headlines
on
trade
and
tariffs
said
peter
cecchini
chief
market
strategist
at
cantor
fitzgerald
in
new
york
they
are
important
from
the
standpoint
that
trade
globalization
has
been
the
cornerstone
for
growth
and
when
you
do
something
to
sort
of
undermine
that
cornerstone
that
s
a
reasonable
reason
for
the
administration
is
due
to
impose
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
worth
billion
beginning
july
likely
prompting
a
response
from
beijing
in
europe
the
brief
break
from
trade
fighting
as
well
as
a
deal
struck
by
eu
leaders
on
immigration
also
helped
sentiment
and
triggered
a
jump
in
the
euro
the
stoxx
was
up
percent
at
its
close
while
germany
s
dax
jumped
percent
while
asian
stocks
also
rose
the
chinese
yuan
suffered
its
worst
month
on
record

percent
against
the
dollar
in
june
as
investors
pulled
money
from
a
market
likely
to
suffer
from
higher
barriers
to
trade
the
dollar
slipped
to
a
low
against
the
euro
after
european
union
leaders
reached
an
agreement
on
migration
that
eased
pressure
on
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
but
the
greenback
remained
on
track
to
log
its
best
quarterly
performance
in
six
quarters
the
yield
curve
between

flattened
