will
not
hire

as
it
seeks
to
avoid
the

that
erupted
between

a

no
one
wants
a

situation
said

jarvis
enbridge
s
executive
of
liquids
pipelines
and
major
projects
in
an
interview
we
certainly
don
t
plan
to
be
engaging
our
own
security
efforts
as
a
replacement
or
a
supplement
to
the
official
law
enforcement
agencies
that
s
the
minnesota
public
utilities
commission
on
thursday
approved
a
rebuild
of
line
opponents
vowed
to
stop
the
project
comparing
their
efforts
to
dapl
protests
protests
of
dapl
initially
were
peaceful
but
tensions
rose
after
protesters
were
and
attacked
by
security
dogs
in
late
the
number
of
protesters
multiplied
and
they
were
hit
with
tear
gas
and
water
cannons
in
freezing
weather
enbridge
has
a
minority
stake
in

we
re
here
to
make
sure
that
nobody
gets
hurt
jarvis
said
if
you
employ
your
own
security
to
do
law
enforcement
you
re
broadening
your
responsibilities
to
an
area
where
we
don
t
believe
we

winona
laduke
executive
director
of
the
honor
the
earth
activist
group
said
she
is
pretty
skeptical
that
enbridge
will
leave
security
to
police
during
dapl
protests
laduke
said
she
asked
enbridge
to
get
involved
to
no
avail
i
asked
them
to
that
situation
she
said
jarvis
said
enbridge
expects
to
have
full
authorization
to
build
by
november
construction
could
start
in
early
a
possible
surplus
of
canadian
pipeline
space
in
a
few
years
factoring
in
line
the
trans
mountain
and
transcanada
corp
s
keystone
xl
is
not
a
significant
risk
to
line
s
business
case
although
each
pipeline
company
will
bear
some
brunt
jarvis
said
currently
space
is
so
tight
on
enbridge
s
mainline
network
that
it
rations
space
to
shippers
called
apportionment
enbridge
proposed
a
modified
system
in
may
before
withdrawing
it
over
concerns
by
oil
shippers
this
time
the
company
intends
to
work
through
a
national
energy
board
neb
regulatory
process
to
find
a
solution
this
year
jarvis
said
there
is
such
a
gulf
in
views
that
no
matter
what
we
do
at
our
own
discretion
we
re
going
to
get
challenged
at
the
neb
he
said
we
hope
to
come
up
with
something
that
has
a
degree
of
support
