malaysian
prime
minister

mohamad
said
on

indonesia
should
join
forces
with
his

to
oppose
pressure
from

on
the
palm

industry
in
the
world
s
top
two
producers
of
the
edible
oil
mahathir
speaking
during
a
state
visit
to
indonesia
said
the
neighbours
faced
similar
problems
in
the
industry
our
palm
oil
is
threatened
by
europe
and
we
need
to
oppose
them
together
mahathir
told
a
joint
news
conference
with
indonesian
president
joko
widodo
the
european
union
is
among
the
two
countries
largest
export
markets
for
palm
oil
but
it
has
moved
to
curb
its
use
to
meet
climate
goals
palm
oil
is
used
in
a
wide
range
of
products
from
chocolate
to
shampoo
and
the
industry
has
come
under
scrutiny
in
recent
years
as
it
is
often
blamed
for
causing
deforestation
and
forest
fires
european
countries
used
to
be
covered
with
forests
but
they
ve
cut
them
down
and
nobody
argues
with
them
about
it
but
when
we
clear
land
they
say
it
pollutes
the
climate
said
the
premier
who
recently
came
back
to
power
in
malaysia
after
a
shock
election
victory
mahathir
also
said
the
neighbours
had
revived
plans
to
jointly
develop
a
car
to
be
sold
in
southeast
asia
in
japan
earlier
this
month
mahathir
had
said
he
hoped
to
begin
a
new
car
project
to
follow
proton
the
car
company
founded
during
his
first
premiership
stint
in
initially
floated
years
ago
the
asean
car
was
to
be
developed
by
proton
and
indonesia
s
pt
adiperkasa
but
the
project
was
shelved
in
we
could
not
proceed
because
of
certain
reasons
but
now
we
plan
to
continue
this
project
again
mahathir
said
without
elaborating
proton
has
struggled
in
recent
years
and
last
year
saw
chinese
auto
company
geely
taking
a
percent
stake
in
the
carmaker
