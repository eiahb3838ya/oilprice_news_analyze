on
friday
after
china
eased
foreign
invesment
limits
but
underlying

was
dampened
by
worries
over
trade
frictions
a
week
before
initial
and
chinese
tariffs
were
set
to
take
effect

on

shares
in
china
rebounded
friday
while
analysts
said
the
jump
reflected
technical
factors
it
was
helped
by
news
that
beijing
would
ease
foreign
investment
curbs
on
sectors
including
banking
automobiles
heavy
industry
and
agriculture
the
country
s
central
bank
also
said
on
thursday
that
it
would
ensure
that
market
liquidity
remained
reasonably
the

gained
percent
and
the
shanghai
composite
index
was

higher
nevertheless
the

the

this
year
and

set
for
their
worst
monthly
performances
since
january
hong
kong
s
hang
seng

rose
percent
despite
the
bump
on
friday
analysts
downplayed
the
impact
of
china
s
relaxing
of
investment
curbs
on
broader
trade
issues
this
may
not
be
enough
to
ease
current
tensions
with
the
calling
for
much
greater
market
access
and
fairer
competition
for
foreign
enterprises
the
list
affirms
china
s
stance
that
opening
up
will
occur
in
its
own
timeframe

analysts
said
in
a
note
elsewhere
in
the
region
investors
remained
focused
on
concerns
over
global
trade
as
the
ambassador
to
china
said
washington
was
not
convinced
that
china
is
willing
to
make
fast
progress
on
trade
the
administration
is
due
to
activate
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
worth
billion
on
july
which
is
expected
to
prompt
a
response
from
beijing
the
trade
war
issue
is
coming
up
to
a
critical
junction
because
of
that
impending
implementation
of
those
tariffs
said
shane
oliver
chief
economist
and
head
of
investment
strategy
at
amp
capital
in
sydney
while
the
scope
of
the
initial
tariffs
is
limited
investors
just
worry
that
tariffs
are
going
to
lead
to
more
retaliation
and
then
escalation

said
the
dollar
index
which
measures
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
six
currencies
fell
percent
to
the
currency
has
risen
in
recent
weeks
helped
by
the
federal
reserve
s
move
to
raise
interest
rates
in
june
and
expectations
of
further
hikes
this
year
the
ongoing
drip
feed
of
high
us
interest
rates
is
creating
consternation
said
oliver
obviously
it
s
pushing
up
the
us
dollar
and
putting
downward
pressure
on
asian
currencies

well
have
