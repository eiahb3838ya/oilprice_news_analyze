farmers
planted
more
soybean
acres
than
corn
for
the
first
time
in
years
even
as
domestic
soy
supplies
reached
the
biggest
on
record
for
early
june
the
agriculture
department
said
on
friday
growers
hoped
for
better
profits
for
the
oilseed
which
costs
less
to
plant
than
corn
but
a
brewing
trade
war
with
china
has
driven
prices
sharply
lower
since

season
ended
usda
said

planted
million
acres
of
soybeans
and

of
corn
that
compares
to
soybean
acreage
of
million
and
corn
acreage
of
million
in
analysts
had
pegged
soybean
acreage
at
million
and
corn
acreage
at
million
based
on
the
average
of
estimates
given
in
a
reuters
poll
corn
and
soybean
futures
rallied
to
session
highs
after
the
report
was
released
but
quickly
pared
gains
you
have
to
ask
yourself
with
corn
being
down
cents
for
the
month
and
beans
down
do
the
bears
want
to
push
those
prices
even
further
down

this
news
said
matt
connelly
grain

energy
analyst
with

i
don
t
think

topping
the
record
of

set
in
soybean
usage
was
the
highest
ever
for
the

at

but

the

the
