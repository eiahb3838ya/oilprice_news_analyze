friday
china
said
in

that
it
would
force
industrial
firms
in

chinese

curbs
in

standards
by
october
with
coking
coal
producers
given
another
year
to
make
the
required
adjustments

some
have
expressed
concern
that
the
tougher
emissions
restrictions
would
undermine
efforts
to
create
a
level
playing
field
raising
production
costs
and
making
it
harder
to
compete
with
rivals
in
other
regions
as
china
increases
curbs

i
believe
the
measures
will
be
expanded
to
more
regions
said
tian
weiyong
head

in
shanxi
and
shaanxi
two
major
regions
tian
said
china
has
promised
to
end
a
one
size
fits
all
approach
to
curbing
smog
and
will
impose
production
curbs
only
on

this
winter
regulators
are
desperate
to
avoid
a
repetition
of
the
fuel
shortages
that
hit
large
parts
of
the
region
last
winter
as
overzealous
officials
rushed
to
comply
