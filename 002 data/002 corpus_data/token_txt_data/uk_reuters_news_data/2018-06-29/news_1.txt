reuters
canada
s
main
stock
index
notched
its
biggest
quarterly
gain
in
more
than
four
years
and
could
gain
more
this
year
as
higher
oil
prices
boost
energy
shares
and
legalization
of
pot
leads
to
deal
making
among
cannabis
companies
investors
said
in
the
second
quarter
the
tsx
was
led
by
a
percent
jump
for
the
energy
sector
which
accounts
for
about
of
the
weight
of
the
index
smaller
sectors
such
as
technology
and
healthcare
also
contributed
with
the
latter
boosted
by
the
strong
performance
of
cannabis
stocks
steve
belisle
senior
portfolio
manager
at
manulife
asset
management
expects
energy
stocks
to
benefit
from
higher
oil
prices
that
boost
cash
flows
and
from
improved
prospects
for
canada
getting
its
oil
to
market

holdings
include

the

s

in
the

its
biggest

p
index

belisle
s
biggest
positions

services
company
cgi
i
would
call
it
a
defensive
growth
company
which
is
exactly
what
you
want
at
this
stage
of
the
cycle
belisle
said
while
the
technology
sector
rose
an
impressive
percent
in
the
second
quarter
it
was
outdone
by
healthcare
which
climbed
percent
led
by
cannabis
stocks
canada
s
government
plans
to
legalize
recreational
marijuana
in
october
as
we
get
close
to
the
launch
i
think
you
are
going
to
see
a
lot
of
m
a
and
joint
ventures
coming
into
the
space
said
greg
taylor
portfolio
manager
at
purpose
investments
you
are
going
to
get
hints
of
companies
that
are
going
to
be
able
to
meet
some
of
their
targets
and
those
that
are
going
to
stocks

canntrust

elvis
picardo
likes
canadian
insurance
companies
such
as
manulife
financial
corp
which
has
lost
ground
since
the
start
of
the
year
but
could
benefit
from
a
rising
interest
rate
environment
higher
bond
yields
reduce
the
value
of
insurance
companies
liabilities
picardo
still
expects
another
leg
to
the
global
stock
market
rally
if
the
global
economy
continues
to
hold
up
and
pick
up
a
little
bit
of
momentum
in
the
next
year
or
so
then
we
think
the
tsx
could
participate
