clean fuel? methane leaks threaten natural gas' climate-friendly image
washington
reuters
executives
from
natural
gas
companies
call
their
increasingly
cheap
and
plentiful
fuel
the
world
s
best
answer
to
climate
change
it
produces
about
half
the
carbon
dioxide
of
coal
when
burned
in
a
power
plant
and
it
can
fuel
trucks
trains
and
ships
while
some
outside
the
industry
see
natural
gas
as
but
a
stepping
stone
to
a
future
when
all
energy
will
be
provided
by
wind
solar
and
other
renewable
sources
this
idea
of
natural
gas
as
a
transition
fuel
to
renewables
is
strange
total
sa
chief
executive
patrick
pouyanne
said
natural
gas
is
a
solution
he
said
this
week
at
the
world
gas
conference
in
washington
the
industry
s
biggest
global
summit
but
environmentalists
regulators
and
many
in
the
industry
itself
warn
of
a
dirty
underbelly
to
natural
gas
or
methane
before
it
is
burned
it
is
one
of
the
most
potent
greenhouse
gases
and
can
reach
the
atmosphere
through
leaks
in
wellheads
compressor
stations
and
chemicals
plants
a
study
published
in
the
scientific
journal
nature
last
week
put
methane
emissions
from
the
oil
and
gas
industry
at
about
million
metric
tonnes
per
year
percent
higher
than
the
official
environmental
protection
agency
estimate
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
energy
sources
meanwhile
are
around
billion
tonnes
the
united
states
is
the
world
s
top
natural
gas
producer
one
of
its
biggest
crude
oil
producers
and
a
growing
exporter
of
both
thanks
to
improved
drilling
technology
that
has
vastly
increased
output
while
methane
emissions
are
relatively
small
compared
to
carbon
dioxide
they
are
a
major
force
in
global
warming
scientists
say
methane
can
trap
more
than
times
more
heat
than
carbon
in
the
first
years
after
escaping
into
the
atmosphere
methane
emissions
are
responsible
for
percent
of
the
warming
our
planet
is
experiencing
right
now
mark
brownstein
of
the
environmental
defense
fund
edf
told
reuters
he
added
that
the
united
states
as
a
top
producer
has
a
responsibility
to
properly
track
emissions
and
reduce
them
president
donald
trump
however
has
been
seeking
to
roll
back
environmental
rules
to
allow
companies
to
rapidly
boost
output
last
year
his
administration
halted
an
regulation
that
would
have
required
drillers
on
federal
land
to
curb
methane
leaks
calling
it
redundant
the
administration
is
taking
the
industry
backwards
and
feeding
into
the
narrative
that
fossil
fuels
are
bad
for
the
world
said
fred
krupp
president
of
the
edf
while
some
have
challenged
the
methane
study
s
conclusions
energy
executives
at
the
triennial
summit
said
industry
should
instead
review
them
and
learn
i
do
believe
that
we
have
to
acknowledge
this
is
an
issue
said
bernard
looney
chief
executive
of
upstream
with
bp
plc
gas
will
not
win
the
argument
that
it
needs
to
win
if
we
don
t
all
put
methane
as
an
issue
on
the
the
stakes
are
high
for
the
industry
global
demand
for
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
a
form
of
the
fuel
that
can
be
transported
globally
by
ship
has
jumped
percent
in
the
last
five
years
according
to
data
from
the
energy
information
administration
lng
demand
is
projected
to
rise
another
percent
this
year
and
keep
growing
thanks
to
a
rapid
uptick
in
imports
by
china
and
other
nations
seeking
to
offset
power
plants
to
reduce
pollution
i
see
that
there
s
a
very
important
role
for
gas
in
cleaning
the
energy
mix
said
rachel
kyte
chief
executive
of
sustainable
energy
for
all
but
let
s
not
leave
the
room
with
the
elephant
still
here
untouched
you
have
to
plug
that
methane
the
bulk
of
global
methane
leakage
comes
from
flaring
where
gas
produced
as
a
byproduct
of
crude
oil
drilling
is
burned
off
because
there
are
no
pipelines
yet
available
to
take
it
to
market
a
lot
also
leaks
from
old
inefficient
facilities
that
need
to
be
upgraded
or
replaced
as
a
result
of
the
leaks
about
billion
worth
of
fuel
vanishes
into
the
air
annually
according
to
the
edf
those
financial
losses
are
a
spur
for
major
oil
and
gas
players
to
voluntarily
take
steps
to
reduce
leaks
greg
guidry
shell
s
evp
of
unconventionals
called
voluntary
action
critical
because
if
you
just
wait
for
regulation
there
will
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
methane
emitted
in
the
sara
ortwein
president
of
xto
energy
inc
a
natural
gas
subsidiary
of
exxon
mobil
said
work
still
must
be
done
to
make
solutions
more
cost
effective
and
requirements
for
leak
detection
could
be
a
reasonable
part
of
a
sound
pratima
rangarajan
chief
executive
of
ogci
climate
investments
said
global
standards
are
needed
in
the
longer
term
what
we
need
for
scale
is
for
everybody
to
do
it
because
you
have
to
across
the
world
and
in
every
country
she
said
for
brownstein
of
the
edf
the
solution
is
simple
inexpensive
monitoring
equipment
like
infrared
cameras
and
drones
can
slash
methane
emissions
along
with
operation
changes
a
lot
of
this
is
not
rocket
science
