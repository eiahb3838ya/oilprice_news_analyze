poll-supply risks to bolster oil; opec unlikely to fill deficit
reuters
oil
prices
look
set
to
stay
strong
for
the
rest
of
this
year
and
in
thanks
to
supply
disruptions
and
as
extra
oil
from
opec
fails
to
meet
rising
demand
a
reuters
poll
showed
on
friday
a
survey
of
economists
and
analysts
forecasts
brent
crude
will
average
a
barrel
in
cents
higher
than
the
forecast
in
last
month
s
poll
and
compared
with
the
average
so
far
this
year
the
monthly
survey
sees
crude
futures
averaging
a
barrel
in
compared
with
forecast
last
month
supply
deficit
in
the
oil
market
is
here
to
stay
frank
schallenberger
head
of
commodity
research
at
lbbw
said
i
expect
opec
to
increase
production
by
some
barrels
per
day
till
the
end
of
the
year
this
won
t
be
enough
to
compensate
for
rising
demand
and
declining
output
in
countries
like
iran
or
last
week
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
led
by
saudi
arabia
and
its
allies
including
russia
agreed
to
boost
oil
supplies
the
group
which
has
curbed
output
since
in
an
attempt
to
address
a
global
supply
glut
said
it
would
return
to
percent
compliance
with
previously
agreed
output
cuts
after
months
of
underproduction
partly
due
to
unplanned
disruptions
global
oil
markets
remain
tight
with
unplanned
supply
stoppages
from
libya
venezuela
and
more
recently
an
outage
at
canada
s
syncrude
upgrader
that
has
especially
strained
north
american
markets
a
number
of
other
geopolitical
risks
weigh
on
the
global
outlook
and
these
are
likely
to
have
a
larger
impact
on
prices
than
in
previous
years
when
oil
stocks
were
comfortable
said
cailin
birch
an
analyst
at
the
economist
intelligence
unit
also
threatening
global
supplies
are
the
implementation
of
sanctions
on
iran
in
november
trade
tensions
with
china
and
elsewhere
could
also
have
an
impact
on
oil
supply
asian
oil
demand
growth
is
likely
to
remain
strong
and
industry
analysts
expect
it
to
increase
by
around
bpd
over
this
year
and
next
the
threat
of
tariffs
on
oil
imports
by
china
could
alter
the
usual
seasonality
of
oil
flows
said
daniela
corsini
commodity
market
economist
at
intesa
sanpaolo
in
milan
a
majority
of
analysts
who
participated
in
the
poll
however
said
they
did
not
expect
a
significant
impact
in
the
short
term
from
the
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
other
major
economies
including
china
rising
risk
aversion
could
weigh
on
business
sentiment
investment
decisions
and
oil
demand
import
tariffs
could
also
make
oil
purchases
more
expensive
leading
to
higher
oil
prices
