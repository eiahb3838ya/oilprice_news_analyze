update 1-struggle to control libyan oil ports adds to global supply worries
reuters
libyan
oil
production
could
face
protracted
disruption
as
factions
in
the
east
seek
to
seize
control
of
crude
exports
adding
pressure
to
a
tight
global
market
eastern
factions
have
tried
to
take
over
oil
exports
in
the
past
but
have
struggled
to
find
buyers
because
western
nations
insist
they
will
deal
only
with
the
internationally
recognised
national
oil
corporation
noc
based
in
the
libyan
capital
of
tripoli
but
this
has
not
stopped
eastern
forces
from
seeking
control
of
the
ports
accusing
libya
s
government
of
failing
to
share
revenues
fairly
the
latest
tussle
for
power
has
already
cut
national
production
to
about
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
after
it
had
been
running
earlier
this
year
at
million
bpd
still
well
below
the
million
bpd
output
before
a
uprising
plunged
libya
into
chaos
the
damage
to
libyan
oil
production
started
with
the
latest
series
of
battles
over
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
ports
which
have
been
closed
for
two
weeks
causing
losses
of
about
bpd
on
thursday
a
parallel
noc
in
the
eastern
city
of
benghazi
started
blocking
tankers
booked
by
the
noc
from
loading
at
zueitina
and
hariga
the
other
port
under
eastern
control
is
brega
the
noc
in
tripoli
said
on
friday
that
it
expects
to
declare
force
majeure
at
zueitina
and
hariga
on
july
bringing
total
losses
to
bpd
or
million
in
daily
revenue

tripoli
chairman
mustafa
sanalla
writing
in
the
financial
times
on
thursday
called
the
latest
crisis
by
far
the
most
dangerous
of
the
challenges
facing
libya
s
oil
industry
since
the
uprising
combined
exports
from
the
five
ports
now
under
eastern
control
had
been
about
bpd
in
may
analytics
firm
vortexa
said
we
took
delivery
of
the
ports
and
we
have
authority
over
them
now
the
head
of
the
parallel
noc
in
benghazi
faraj
said
told
reuters
adding
that
orders
had
been
issued
to
prevent
the
entry
of
any
tanker
that
was
not
following
its
instructions
the
oil
market
already
under
pressure
from
falling
venezuelan
and
angolan
output
as
well
as
worries
about
a
squeeze
on
iranian
supplies
as
sanctions
bite
remains
tight
even
after
opec
and
its
allies
agreed
to
ease
their
production
curbs
any
lost
barrel
from
libya
will
be
very
painful
said
commerzbank
analyst
carsten
fritsch
it
could
not
have
come
at
a
more
inconvenient
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
russia
and
its
allies
agreed
last
week
to
return
to
percent
compliance
with
cuts
that
have
been
in
place
since
january
instead
of
exceeding
those
curbs
but
that
brings
its
own
pressure
to
the
market
output
increases
will
mostly
be
met
by
opec
s
de
facto
leader
saudi
arabia
and
russia
which
erodes
the
buffer
of
spare
capacity
that
can
relieve
unexpected
supply
disruptions
libya
s
output
had
tumbled
as
low
as
bpd
in
before
last
year
s
recovery
to
about
million
bpd
the
turnaround
was
made
possible
in
september
when
the
libyan
national
army
lna
led
by
commander
khalifa
haftar
took
over
blockaded
oil
ports
including
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
and
allowed
noc
in
tripoli
to
reopen
them
but
eastern
factions
reversed
that
policy
in
june
accusing
the
central
bank
in
tripoli
of
paying
salaries
to
the
lna
s
opponents
and
giving
insufficient
funds
to
the
east
eastern
officials
have
said
they
would
send
revenues
to
a
parallel
central
bank
based
in
the
eastern
town
of
bayda
yet
those
revenues
may
not
flow
easily
france
s
total
which
this
year
bought
a
percent
stake
in
the
waha
oil
company
that
exports
through
es
sider
said
it
would
only
deal
with
noc
in
tripoli
in
line
and
european
demands
total
is
bound
by
international
and
libyan
laws
including
united
nations
security
council
resolutions
which
demand
that
libya
s
oil
facilities
and
exports
remain
under
the
exclusive
control
of
noc
it
said
referring
to
the
company
in
tripoli
the
united
states
the
european
union
and
individual
european
states
have
repeated
statements
demanding
that
noc
in
tripoli
has
sole
control
though
diplomats
said
the
western
warnings
were
delayed
as
efforts
were
made
to
reverse
the
move
by
eastern
forces
to
put
benghazi

noc
in
charge
