s
competition
regulator
has
identified
local
areas
where
sainsbury
s
and
takeover
target
asda
s
stores
overlap
threatening
higher
prices
or
a
worse
quality
of
service
it
said
on
thursday
last
week
the
competition
and
markets
authority
cma
referred
sainsbury
s
proposed
billion
pound
purchase
of
rival
asda
the
british
supermarket
arm
of
walmart
for
an
or
phase
review
saying
it
could
result
in
a
substantial
lessening
in
competition
in
places
where
both
chains
had
shops
both
sainsbury
s
britain
s
no
supermarket
chain
and
asda
the
no
had
requested
a
to
a
phase
process
on
thursday
the
cma
published
the
full
text
of
its
initial
phase
decision
revealing
the
figure
and
sending
shares
in
sainsbury
s
down
as
much
as
percent
sainsbury
s
has
supermarkets
convenience
stores
and
petrol
filling
stations
asda
has
grocery
stores
and
petrol
filling
stations
encouraged
by
last
year
s
surprise
decision
by
the
cma
to
unconditionally
clear
market
leader
tesco
s
near
billion
pounds
purchase
of
wholesaler
booker
sainsbury
s
and
asda
have
expressed
confidence
the
regulator
will
not
insist
on
mass
store
disposals
but
have
not
said
how
many
would
make
the
deal
unattractive
a
source
with
knowledge
of
sainsbury
s
and
asda
s
thinking
has
told
reuters
store
disposals
that
run
into
the
hundreds
would
likely
kill
their
deal
analysts
noted
that
the
cma
identified
areas
of
concern
in
its
phase
review
of
the
deal
but
did
not
insist
on
any
disposals
after
phase
the
watchdog
had
identified
areas
of
concern
in
its
phase
probe
of
discount
retailer
poundland
s
takeover
of
stores
but
again
did
not
ask
for
any
disposals
whilst
at
first
glance
the
number
of
local
areas
the
cma
identified
seems
high
the
cma
s
decisional
practice
strongly
suggests
that
the
final
number
of
local
areas
of
concern
in
the
phase
merger
review
will
be
significantly
lower
said
nelson
jung
a
partner
at
law
firm
clifford
chance
and
a
former
director
of
mergers
at
the
cma
analysts
at
ubs
have
a
base
case
scenario
of
a
modest
store
disposals
to
satisfy
the
regulator
however
that
number
rises
to
stores
if
the
cma
excludes
discounters
such
as
aldi
and
lidl
as
competitors
in
its
analysis
the
cma
did
not
include
the
impact
of
discounters
aldi
and
lidl
in
its
phase
competition
assessments
but
said
this
did
not
infer
they
would
be
excluded
in
the
phase
review
sainsbury
s
and
asda
have
both
said
that
discounters
online
grocery
and
food
delivery
businesses
should
all
be
included
in
the
cma
s
probe
spokeswomen
for
both
sainsbury
s
and
asda
said
they
welcomed
the
start
of
the
phase
process
the
cma
s
deadline
for
a
decision
on
sainsbury
is
march
next
year
