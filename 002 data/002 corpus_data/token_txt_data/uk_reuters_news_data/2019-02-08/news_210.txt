london
reuters
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
is
facing
likely
defeat
in
parliament
on
tuesday
when
she
asks
members
of
parliament
mps
to
approve
her
brexit
deal
a
decision
that
would
trigger
huge
uncertainty
about
the
future
of
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
may
has
warned
that
rejecting
her
deal
opens
up
the
possibility
of
brexit
being
stopped
or
that
britain
leaves
disruptively
without
a
deal
she
has
promised
to
respond
quickly
to
any
defeat
so
what
could
happen
next
if
she
loses
may
must
submit
a
new
plan
for
britain
s
next
steps
by
the
end
of
it
is
not
clear
what
may
s
plan
b
is
but
some
local
media
have
reported
she
would
ask
parliament
to
vote
again
on
the
deal
perhaps
after
seeking
another
set
of
reassurances
from
the
eu
some
mps
have
floated
the
idea
that
parliament
could
in
a
temporary
break
from
convention
in
britain
take
control
of
the
process
away
from
the
government
and
hand
it
to
a
committee
of
senior
mps
from
across
the
political
spectrum
it
is
not
clear
that
this
plan
is
technically
possible
or
whether
it
has
enough
support
to
succeed
the
government
said
any
attempt
to
prevent
it
from
meeting
its
legal
obligation
to
deliver
an
orderly
eu
exit
would
be
extremely
concerning
may
could
resign
as
leader
of
the
conservative
party
triggering
an
internal
contest
to
replace
her
without
a
general
election
may
defeated
an
attempt
to
oust
her
as
leader
of
the
conservative
party
in
december
winning
a
confidence
vote
by
votes
to
the
result
means
her
position
as
leader
of
the
party
can
not
be
challenged
for
months
the
opposition
labour
party
has
said
it
will
call
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
the
government
if
may
s
deal
is
rejected
but
has
not
specified
exactly
when
if
a
majority
of
mps
vote
against
may
s
government
labour
would
have
days
to
prove
by
a
vote
that
it
could
command
a
majority
and
form
its
own
government
that
would
allow
labour
to
take
control
of
the
country
without
an
if
may
s
government
loses
a
confidence
vote
and
labour
is
unable
to
form
a
new
government
an
election
is
called
may
could
also
call
a
general
election
herself
if
of
mps
in
parliament
agree
to
it
may
has
said
that
a
general
election
is
not
in
the
national
interest
options
the
route
to
a
second
referendum
on
brexit
or
a
people
s
vote
is
unclear
but
unless
the
plan
to
give
control
of
the
process
to
parliament
is
successful
it
would
require
the
backing
of
the
government
of
the
day
a
new
referendum
can
be
called
only
if
it
is
approved
by
parliament
with
may
against
a
second
referendum
and
the
opposition
labour
party
not
committed
to
one
but
not
ruling
one
out
a
second
referendum
would
need
either
a
change
in
prime
minister
a
change
in
government
or
an
abrupt
change
in
policy
an
increasingly
vocal
contingent
of
mps
from
across
the
political
spectrum
supports
a
fresh
vote
to
break
the
impasse
in
parliament
but
so
far
they
have
not
been
able
to
prove
there
is
a
majority
in
parliament
for
this
view
even
if
parliament
did
agree
in
principle
to
a
second
referendum
britain
would
then
have
to
ask
for
an
extension
to
its
timetable
for
leaving
the
eu
the
government
could
seek
to
extend
the
negotiating
period
with
the
eu
to
give
it
time
to
try
to
reach
a
better
deal
hold
a
general
election
or
conduct
a
second
referendum
the
government
could
also
withdraw
its
notice
of
intention
to
leave
the
eu
which
the
european
court
of
justice
has
ruled
it
can
do
without
consent
of
other
eu
countries
may
has
said
she
does
not
want
to
delay
britain
s
exit
from
the
eu
and
will
not
revoke
the
notice
of
intention
to
leave
