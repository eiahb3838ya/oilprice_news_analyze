times
chief
executive
john
ridding
is
to
pay
back
some
of

a
group

the
newspaper
s
reporters
complained
about
his
pay
steve
bird
joint
head
of
the
national
union
of
journalists
at
the
newspaper
wrote
to
ft
editors
and
journalists
this
month
saying
ridding
s
pay
was
absurdly
high
and
calling
for
him
to
give
some
back
to
help
those
on
lower
salaries
ridding
said
in
an
email
to
staff
which
was
seen
by
reuters
that
his
salary
had
been
set
by
japanese
media
group
nikkei
which
bought
the
ft
for
billion
in
adding
it
was
independently
assessed
and
highly
while
our
performance
has
been
strong
i
recognise
that
the
size
of
the
consequent
jump
in
my
own
total
reward
in
feels
anomalous
and
has
created
concerns
he
wrote
ridding
said
he
had
decided
his
remuneration
should
be
restructured
for
now
i
have
decided
to
reinvest
into
the
ft
the
increase
awarded
in
which
is
pounds
before
ridding
said
the
first
call
on
the
money
would
be
a
women
s
development
fund
to
boost
the
ft
s
efforts
to
promote
women
to
more
senior
roles
and
reduce
the
gender
pay
gap
the
balance
of
funds
will
be
used
to
help
meet
the
company
s
overall
financial
objectives
he
said
the
journalists
union
at
the
ft
unanimously
passed
a
resolution
welcoming
redding
s
actions
but
said
they
did
not
go
far
enough
and
demanded
higher
pay
for
trainees
and
pay
increases
for
other
employees
ridding
should
also
clarify
what
he
would
be
paid
this
year
and
forego
his
bonus
for
the
resolution
said
we
believe
the
company
should
respond
to
the
widespread
anger
among
staff
as
a
matter
of
urgency
the
newspaper
s
union
chapel
said
in
a
statement
if
we
do
not
receive
a
timely
response
to
all
of
our
demands
we
instruct
chapel
reps
to
place
this
matter
into
dispute
and
take
such
steps
as
may
be
necessary
up
to
and
including
balloting
for
industrial
nikkei
said
in

it
was
very
satisfied
with
the
growth
of
the
newspaper
under
ridding
and
his
team
and
the
success
of
the
partnership
we
respect
and
support
his
proposal
to
adjust
his
remuneration
to
refocus
attention
