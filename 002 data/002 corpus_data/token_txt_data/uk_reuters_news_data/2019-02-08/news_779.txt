ireland
s
government
on
tuesday
approved
the
exhumation
and
reburial
of
the
remains
of
hundreds
of
babies
left
in
unmarked
graves
at
the
site
of
a
former
home
for
unwed
mothers
in
the
western
town
of
tuam
findings
last
year
by
an
official
inquiry
that
significant
quantities
of
remains
were
stored
in
underground
chambers
horrified
ireland
reviving
anguish
over
how
women
and
children
were
once
treated
at
catholic
institutions
almost
children
could
be
interred
in
the
grounds
according
to
a
local
researcher
who
first
brought
the
issue
to
light
in
by
comparing
the
number
of
death
certificates
issued
to
recorded
burials
at
the
site
the
infant
mortality
rate
at
institutions
was
significantly
higher
than
in
wider
irish
society
at
that
time
with
death
certificates
mostly
blaming
infections
like
measles
gastroenteritis
bronchitis
tuberculosis
and
pneumonia
relatives
have
alleged
the
babies
were
mistreated
because
they
were
born
to
unmarried
women
every
effort
will
be
made
to
locate
and
recover
all
juvenile
remains
from
the
site
children
s
minister
katherine
zappone
told
a
news
conference
saying
the
testimony
of
relatives
who
had
lost
relatives
at
the
home
will
live
with
her
forever
i
am
committed
to
ensuring
that
all
the
children
interred
at
this
site
can
have
a
dignified
and
respectful
burial
she
said
run
by
nuns
from
the
bon
secours
order
the
home
operated
from
to
and
was
demolished
in
the
remains
dated
from
between
foetal
weeks
and
years
of
age
were
found
at
the
site
which
is
now
an
estate
of
modest
homes
the
church
s
prestige
and
authority
have
been
greatly
diminished
over
the
past
three
decades
by
a
series
of
scandals
over
paedophile
priests
abuse
at
magdalene
laundries
forced
adoptions
of
illegitimate
babies
and
other
painful
issues
during
pope
francis
recent
visit
to
ireland
where
he
begged
forgiveness
for
the
multitude
of
abuses
suffered
at
the
hand
of
the
church
he
was
handed
a
letter
by
zappone
calling
for
a
substantial
contribution
to
the
cost
of
action
at
the
site
she
said
on
tuesday
that
the
vatican
had
not
yet
responded
but
that
the
bon
secours
order
had
offered
a
voluntary
contribution
of
million
euros
towards
the
estimated
to
billion
euro
cost
described
as
a
chamber
of
horrors
last
year
by
then
prime
minister
enda
kenny
excavating
the
site
would
not
be
easy
zaponne
said
first
requiring
legislation
and
then
a
phased
approach
that
she
was
unable
to
put
a
timeline
on
she
also
said
that
ireland
must
prepare
itself
for
further
truths
to
come
to
the
fore
next
year
when
a
wider
inquiry
into
the
homes
reports
on
institutions
where
tens
of
thousands
of
unmarried
pregnant
women
including
rape
victims
were
sent
to
give
birth
