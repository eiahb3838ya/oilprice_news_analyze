that sinking feeling? sterling traders prepare for brexit meltdown
london
reuters
having
sunk
to
lows
sterling
could
fall
by
up
to
another
percent
in
the
coming
months
should
britain
crash
out
of
the
european
union
without
a
deal
on
future
trade
ties
luring
more
speculators
to
bet
against
the
currency
sterling
lost
almost
two
percent
last
week
just
as
british
holidaymakers
were
heading
off
for
some
overseas
sun
the
latest
move
lower
was
kickstarted
by
trade
minister
liam
fox
warning
that
with
britain
less
than
eight
months
from
its
scheduled
eu
departure
date
in
march
there
was
a
percent
chance
of
leaving
without
a
deal
the
moves
were
certainly
exacerbated
by
a
big
and
broad
dollar
rally
and
the
pound
has
since
clawed
back
the
worst
of
its
losses
against
the
euro
rebounding
from
lows
but
the
worry
say
analysts
is
that
in
the
absence
of
any
conclusive
developments
towards
a
deal
over
the
coming
months
the
pound
s
spiral
will
accelerate
while
the
clock
ticks
down
on
the
deadline
and
hedge
funds
are
tempted
into
betting
against
the
currency
and
muddying
the
horizon
are
major
political
events
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
conservative
party
conference
in
early
october
and
meetings
of
eu
leaders
in
late
september
and
then
there
s
no
guaranteed
date
for
when
brexit
progress
or
hard
brexit
will
be
known
by
apart
from
exit
day
on
march
nomura
analysts
told
clients
describing
a
hard
brexit
as
a
cliff
edge
moment
in
which
britain
crashes
out
of
the
eu
in
march
without
any
future
trading
arrangements
in
place
we
find
that
we
are
very
much
in
the
early
stages
of
pricing
for
a
hard
pound
vs
dollar
how
will
sterling
trade
in
the
later
stages
then
most
economists
still
believe
britain
will
reach
a
deal
with
the
eu
but
the
latest
reuters
polls
indicate
risk
of
no
deal
have
risen
to
percent
versus
percent
in
july
some
bookmakers
price
even
higher
odds
above
percent
if
that
comes
to
pass
britain
s
currency
would
crash
to
from
today
s
levels
the
reuters
poll
showed
a
fall
of
around
percent
but
sterling
is
forecast
to
rise
to
by
if
an
agreement
is
reached
others
predict
more
precipitous
falls
commerzbank
sees
a
percent
drop
against
the
dollar
and
euro
that
would
leave
the
pound
close
to
parity
with
the
single
currency
below
referendum
lows
of
pence
and
current
levels
of
pence
the
uncertain
outlook
and
the
prospect
of
a
sudden
sterling
surge
had
kept
many
hedge
funds
on
the
sidelines
now
though
sensing
profits
to
be
made
some
funds
have
begun
to
wager
against
the
pound
prominent
brexit
campaigner
and
hedge
fund
boss
crispin
odey
told
reuters
he
was
betting
against
sterling
he
predicts
it
will
hit
before
march
concern
may
be
mounting
at
the
corporate
level
too
a
senior
currencies
trader
at
a
large
european
bank
said
british
exporters
had
rushed
to
hedge
themselves
while
speculators
were
using
options
to
short
the
pound
in
increasing
numbers
below
the
mark
is
where
corporates
start
to
get
nervous
the
trader
said
speaking
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
hedge
funds
have
been
buyers
of
sterling
on
the
dips
but
that
s
starting
to
change
if
it
weakens
further
we
will
see
some
accelerated
perhaps
reflecting
that
shift

prepared
to

sterling
remains
a
risky
play
should
britain

the

a
brexit
on
these
terms
would
also
clear
the
path
for
the

of

to
tighten

policy
further
sterling
also
looks
cheap
according
to
some
historical
measures
using
the
real
effective

rate
or
reer
gauge
a
currency
s
value
against
trade
partners
currencies
adjusted
for

sterling
is
six
percent
below
its
average
and

below
its
average
under

parity
or

theory
which
compares
the
prices
of
a
basket
of
goods

trade
at
and
at
pence
sure
there
is
gloom
now
but
the
currency
remains
undervalued
as
it
has
been
historically
said
geoffrey
yu
head
of

investment
office
at

wealth
management
some
buyers
will
see
this
as
an
sterling
looks
cheap
on
a
historical
basis
