brussels
reuters
european
council
president
donald
tusk
said
on
friday
he
had
no
mandate
to
reopen
brexit
negotiations
with
britain
while
the
head
of
the
bloc
s
executive
juncker
said
he
admired
prime
minister
theresa
may
tusk
and
juncker
were
speaking
at
a
news
conference
after
two
days
of
talks
at
an
eu
summit
that
were
dominated
by
the
issue
of
brexit
and
saw
the
other
national
leaders
of
the
bloc
offer
may
only
vague
assurances
over
their
brexit
deal
i
have
no
mandate
to
organise
any
further
negotiations
we
have
to
exclude
any
further
opening
of
the
withdrawal
agreement
tusk
said
but
of
course
we
are
staying
here
in
brussels
and
i
m
always
at
the
pm
s
juncker
captured
by
cameras
earlier
on
friday
during
an
apparently
heated
exchange
with
may
said
we
have
to
bring
down
the
temperature
around
brexit
talks
he
said
he
did
not
mean
to
offend
may
and
his
comments
describing
the
british
position
as
nebulous
referred
to
the
broader
state
of
the
brexit
debate
in
the
united
kingdom
we
sypmathyse
with
mrs
may
juncker
told
a
news
conference
i
have
the
highest
respect
for
the
british
he
added
the
eu
in
answering
may
s
plea
for
more
assurances
on
the
brexit
deal
so
that
she
could
get
it
past
her
parliament
promised
to
start
negotiations
with
the
uk
on
their
new
trade
deal
the
second
after
their
divorce
deal
is
approved
so
that
the
contentious
irish
backstop
hopefully
never
has
to
kick
in
tusk
also
offered
his
words
of
respect
we
have
treated
pm
may
with
the
outmost
respect
all
of
us
we
really
appreciate
the
efforts
to
ratify
our
common
agreement
tusk
said
we
have
treated
pm
may
with
much
greater
empathy
and
respect
than

british
members
