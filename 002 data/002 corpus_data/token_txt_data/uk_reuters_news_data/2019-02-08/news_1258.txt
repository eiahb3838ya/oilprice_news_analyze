standard
chartered
will
likely
have
to
wait
until
the
autumn
at
the
earliest
for
approval
from
german
and
european
banking
regulators
to
turn
its
frankfurt
branch
into
its
european
union
subsidiary
a
spokeswoman
for
the
bank
said
on
monday
standard
chartered
may
also
have
to
move
a
few
more
jobs
than
originally
envisaged
to
frankfurt
the
spokeswoman
said
as
the
bank
seeks
to
satisfy
the
european
central
bank
and
german
authorities
about
its
plans
for
the
hub
to
conduct
its
business
in
europe
after
britain
leaves
the
bloc
in
march
the
bank
began
interviewing
candidates
in
march
this
year
for
about
jobs
it
is
moving
to
frankfurt

reported
on
march
after
it
submitted
its
license
application
to
german
and
european
authorities
in
november
nine
months
later
stanchart
is
still
waiting
for
approval
a
sign
of
how
european
regulators
are
pushing
banks
to
transfer
more
staff
and
submit
more
detailed
plans
for
their
european
hubs
to
avoid
them
becoming
little
more
than
empty
shells
standard
chartered
was
among
the
first
of
about
banks
to
formally
apply
for
licenses
to
open
bases
or
expand
existing
ones
in
the
euro
zone
by
march
the
delay
in
the
finalization
of
the
move
comes
amid
deepening
scrutiny
by
the
main
european
banking
regulator
to
ensure
lenders
have
a
plan
to
staff
and
structure
their
hubs
the
ecb
which
supervises
the
main
lenders
in
the
euro
zone
and
is
a
central
player
in
setting
conditions
for
the
new
bases
said
last
month
it
will
prevent
banks
from
creating
token
offices
banks
will
be
particularly
scrutinized
as
to
whether
work
that
is
outsourced
from
european
hubs
to
countries
outside
europe
still
complies
with
local
regulations
within
the
trading
bloc
standard
chartered
has
to
that
end
created
a
dedicated
outsourcing
oversight
officer
role
in
frankfurt
the
spokeswoman
said
whose
duties
will
be
to
ensure
that
such
overseas
business
activities
are
compliant
with
german
and
european
rules
