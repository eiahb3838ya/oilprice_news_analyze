instant view - reaction after text of brexit divorce deal agreed
london
reuters
the
european
union
and
britain
have
agreed
a
draft
text
of
a
brexit
withdrawal
agreement
and
prime
minister
theresa
may
will
present
it
to
her
senior
ministers
on
wednesday
below
is
early
reaction
we
will
look
at
the
details
of
what
has
been
agreed
when
they
are
available
but
from
what
we
know
of
the
shambolic
handling
of
these
negotiations
this
is
unlikely
to
be
a
good
deal
for
the
country
labour
has
been
clear
from
the
beginning
that
we
need
a
deal
to
support
jobs
and
the
economy
and
that
guarantees
standards
and
protections
if
this
deal
doesn
t
meet
our
six
tests
and
work
for
the
whole
country
then
we
will
vote
against
it
is
vassal
state
stuff
for
the
first
time
in
a
thousand
years
this
place
this
parliament
will
not
have
a
say
over
the
laws
that
govern
this
country
it
is
a
quite
incredible
state
of
affairs
it
means
having
to
accept
rules
and
regulations
over
which
we
have
no
say
ourselves
it
is
utterly
unacceptable
to
anyone
who
believes
in
democracy
for
the
first
time
since
partition
dublin
under
these
proposals
will
have
more
say
in
some
aspects
of
the
government
of
northern
ireland
than
london
so
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
support
the
trick
will
be
for
theresa
may
can
she
satisfy
everyone
it
is
going
to
be
a
very
very
hard
sell
i
would
have
thought
but
let
s
wait
and
see
the
actual
detail
the
crucial
issue
is
going
to
be
what
happens
when
it
comes
to
cabinet
and
when
it
gets
to
parliament
we
haven
t
seen
any
details
we
ll
see
what
happens
people
know
what
our
position
is
very
clearly
and
we
will
judge
whatever
comes
forward
against
the
positions
that
have
already
been
the
headline
stuff
is
really
just
a
regurgitation
of
the
deal
which
was
offered
in
march
of
this
year
which
the
prime
minister
said
no
uk
prime
minister
could
ever
sign
up
to
if
she
does
sign
up
to
this
it
will
lead
to
the
of
the
united
kingdom
and
it
will
also
keep
the
united
kingdom
tied
into
eu
institutions
without
the
ability
to
decide
when
we
want
to
break
free
from
jacob
leader
of
faction
of
conservative
mps
this
is
the
vassal
state
it
is
a
failure
of
the
government
s
negotiating
position
it
is
a
failure
to
deliver
on
brexit
and
it
is
potentially
dividing
up
the
united
kingdom
it
is
very
hard
to
see
any
reason
why
the
cabinet
should
support
northern
ireland
being
ruled
from
i
hope
the
cabinet
will
block
it
and
if
not
i
hope
parliament
will
block
it
i
think
what
we
know
of
this
deal
is
deeply
i
m
confident
we
ll
get
this
through
parliament
and
that
we
can
deliver
on
what
the
prime
minister
committed
to
on
delivering
brexit
but
making
sure
that
that
is
in
the
best
interests
of
companies
businesses
and
families
it
s
a
major
document
hundreds
of
pages
and
people
will
be
looking
at
that
carefully
but
i
m
confident
that
we
re
hopefully
on
the
cusp
of
beginning
to
get
to
the
point
where
we
re
delivering
on
brexit
in
a
really
practical
way
theresa
may
has
stuck
with
it
through
a
very
very
tough
year
or
two
and
will
be
delivering
the
best
interests
of
asked
if
the
government
s
days
were
numbered
he
referred
to
reports
of
the
deal
and
said
if
this
is
the
case
the
answer
is
almost
certainly
yes
because
they
re
in
real
trouble
if
they
bring
back
something
unacceptable
to
their
if
the
pm
s
deal
satisfies
and
can
t
command
a
majority
we
mustn
t
fall
for
her
spin
that
the
uk
crashing
out
of
eu
without
a
deal
is
then
inevitable
instead
we
should
take
the
opportunity
to
get
better
options
