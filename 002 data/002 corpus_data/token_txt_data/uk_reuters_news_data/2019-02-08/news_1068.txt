and
the

the
bank
of

declined
to
comment
and
the
exact
context
of
carney
s
remarks
is
unclear
according
to
the
guardian
carney
warned
the
ministers
including
may
that
the
impact
of
a
chaotic
brexit
could
be
as
catastrophic
as
the
financial
crisis
speaking
at
the
irish
central
bank
on
friday
carney
did
not
directly
address
the
media
reports
but
reiterated
that
the
boe
had
tested
banks
against
very
severe
scenarios
including
dramatic
house
price
falls
and
much
higher
interest
rates
that
s
not
a
prediction
of
what
s
going
to
happen
but
that
stress
testing
is
what
we
need
to
do
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
system
is
able
to
continue
to
lend
he
said
our
job
after
all
is
not
to
hope
for
the
best

to
plan
for
the

long
said

bank
stress
tests
represent
scenarios
rather
than
forecasts
of
likely
outcomes
many
business
chiefs
and
investors
fear
politics
could
get
in
the
way
of
brexit
thrusting
the
world
s
fifth
largest
economy
into
a
divorce

say
would
weaken

was
due
to
speak
by

to
eu
chief
negotiator
michel
barnier
on
friday
in
recent
months
may
s
government
has
stepped
up
planning
for
a
brexit
and
has
underscored
the
disruption
that
such
a
move
would
cause
to
businesses
and
the
public
without
a
deal
the
uk
would
move
from
seamless
trade
with
the
rest
of
the
eu
to
customs
arrangements
set
by
the
world
trade
organization
for
external
states
with
no
preferential
deals
in
one
note
of
optimism
carney
said
that
if
may
struck
a
brexit
deal
on
the
basis
of
her
chequers
proposals
then
the
economy
would
outperform
current
forecasts
because
it
would
be
better
than
the
bank
s
assumed
outcome
the
ft
said
carney
whose
term
of
office
was
this
week
extended
until
the
end
of
january
to
deal
with
brexit
disruption
told
ministers
a
chaotic
exit
would
lead
to
a
plunge
in
sterling
that
would
drive
up
inflation
and
interest
rates
the
times
said
further
the
bank
of
england
would
be
unable
to
soften
the
crisis
by
cutting
interest
rates
because
of
the
inflationary
impact
of
such
a
move
carney
told
ministers
according
to
the
financial
times
if
carney
s
scenario
were
to
come
to
pass
then
such
a
crash
in
house
prices
would
spell
political
death
for
any
prime
minister
though
there
was
scepticism
about
the
reports
from
his
opponents
and
some
economists
carney
has
made
himself
a
laughing
stock
in
the
city
with
such
an
outrageous
warning
