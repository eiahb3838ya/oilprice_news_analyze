tesla
inc
s
board
named
a
special
committee
of
three
directors
on
tuesday
to
decide
what
to
do
about
chief
executive
elon
musk
s
potential
offer
to
take
the
electric
carmaker
private
although
musk
has
yet
to
make
a
formal
offer
and
is
still
negotiating
to
hire
advisers
needed
to
do
a
deal
the
board
announced
the
move
in
tesla
s
first
filing
with
regulators
since
musk
tweeted
a
week
ago
that
he
was
considering
taking
the
company
private
and
had
already
secured
funding
for
a
offer
valuing
tesla
at
billion
since
that
unorthodox
announcement
on
which
has
triggered
investor
lawsuits
and
an
investigation
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
musk
and
tesla
have
scrambled
to
bring
order
to
the
process
of
negotiating
a
deal
musk
tweeted
on
monday
he
was
working
with
goldman
sachs
group
inc
and
private
equity
firm
silver
lake
as
financial
advisers
however
as
of
tuesday
goldman
sachs
was
still
negotiating
its
terms
of
engagement
with
musk
according
to
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
silver
lake
was
also
not
signed
up
officially
as
a
financial
adviser
as
it
is
helping
musk
explore
how
to
take
tesla
private
with
no
compensation
reuters
reported
on
monday
goldman
sachs
and
silver
lake
declined
to
comment
musk
s
effort
to
associate
his
potential
bid
with
some
of
wall
street
s
most
venerable
institutions
even
at
the
risk
of
misrepresenting
their
involvement
comes
as
pressure
has
been
building
on
him
to
justify
his
pronouncement
last
week
that
funding
for
a
deal
had
been
musk
said
on
monday
he
had
held
talks
with
a
saudi
sovereign
fund
on
a
buyout
that
would
take
tesla
off
the
nasdaq
exchange
an
extraordinary
move
for
what
is
now
the
united
states
most
valuable
automaker
tesla
has
a
market
value
of
billion
bigger
than
detroit
rivals
general
motors
co
or
ford
motor
co
which
produce
far
more
cars
tesla
shares
closed
down
percent
at
on
tuesday
they
are
still
above
their
closing
price
the
day
before
musk
tweeted
his
plan
to
take
tesla
private
which
pushed
the
shares
up
percent
to
an
high
tesla
said
in
its
statement
on
tuesday
the
special
committee
had
the
authority
to
take
any
action
on
behalf
of
the
board
to
evaluate
and
negotiate
a
potential
transaction
and
alternatives
to
any
transaction
proposed
by
musk
that
means
three
members
of
tesla
s
board
will
now
weigh
whether
it
is
advisable
or
even
feasible
to
pursue
what
could
be
the
deal
and
they
are
doing
so
before
receiving
a
formal
proposal
from
the
ceo
musk
has
yet
to
persuade
wall
street
analysts
and
investors
that
he
can
find
the
billions
needed
to
complete
the
deal
or
even
such
a
deal
is
a
good
idea
for
a
company
despite
elon
musk
s
frustration
with
being
a
public
company
i
think
there
are
more
advantages
to
remaining
public
said
cfra
analyst
efraim
levy
citing
cheaper
access
to
capital
and
media
exposure
due
to
interest
in
a
public
company
chaim
siegel
an
analyst
at
elazar
advisors
said
it
would
be
better
for
tesla
to
remain
a
public
company
so
investors
can
benefit
from
an
earnings
inflection
if
musk
fulfills
his
promise
of
making
the
company
profitable

year
