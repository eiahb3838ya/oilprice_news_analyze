'spent' hamilton soaks up special victory in singapore
singapore
reuters
lewis
hamilton
felt
a
mixture
of
elation
and
exhaustion
after
converting
his
stunning
pole
position
into
a
victory
at
the
singapore
grand
prix
on
sunday
as
the
briton
tightened
his
grip
on
a
fifth
formula
one
world
championship
title
once
hamilton
got
a
clean
start
at
the
marina
bay
street
circuit
he
could
control
the
race
from
the
front
and
although
he
stretched
his
advantage
over
sebastian
vettel
to
points
with
six
races
remaining
the
briton
admitted
he
was
shattered
i
m
spent
that
was
a
tough
race
i
have
such
great
support
here
and
we
had
a
great
start
hamilton
said
after
claiming
victory
at
the
floodlit
circuit
for
the
fourth
time
in
his
career
the
team
had
never
given
up
faith
and
belief
in
me
and
team
mate
valtteri
bottas
that
was
the
longest
race
in
my
life
and
its
a
blessing
i
m
just
blessed
it
was
long
but
it
was
still
fun
driving
this
track
is
incredible
especially
with
these
mercedes
have
long
regarded
singapore
as
a
bogey
track
and
were
fearing
the
worst
as
vettel
s
ferrari
team
and
the
red
bulls
dominated
practice
but
hamilton
drove
a
perfect
lap
to
qualify
first
and
was
never
really
threatened
in
the
race
i
got
a
great
start
and
was
able
to
control
the
pack
control
the
tyres
and
push
where
i
needed
to
push
he
said
after
crossing
the
line
almost
nine
seconds
ahead
of
red
bull
s
max
verstappen
with
vettel
way
off
the
pace
in
third
we
knew
they
ferrari
were
going
to
be
spectacular
here
this
weekend
and
we
knew
it
was
going
to
take
something
quite
special
to
beat
them
it
was
quite
a
monumental
moment
for
us
as
a
team
i
definitely
didn
t
think
i
d
come
to
singapore
with
points
more
in
the
lead
of
the
title
but
i
m
very
grateful
the
ferraris
put
a
good
fight
this
weekend
but
i
m
not
sure
where
their
pace
went
in
the
hamilton
did
have
one
minor
scare
on
lap
when
he
got
caught
up
behind
some
back
markers
and
verstappen
closed
right
up
behind
him
he
held
off
a
brief
challenge
from
the
dutchman
and
raced
away
once
he
had
clear
track
in
front
of
him
i
was
a
little
but
unlucky
with
the
traffic
these
guys
haas
romain
grosjean
and
williams
sergey
sirotkin
were
moving
and
it
was
difficult
to
follow
hamilton
added
max
was
lucky
i
think
and
the
guys
wouldn
t
let
me
by
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
but
once
i
got
past
i
could
put
the
pedal
down
and
just
had
to
the
next
round
is
in
sochi
russia
on
where
hamilton
has
won
twice
before
and
mercedes
all
four
races
since
it
was
added
to
the
formula
