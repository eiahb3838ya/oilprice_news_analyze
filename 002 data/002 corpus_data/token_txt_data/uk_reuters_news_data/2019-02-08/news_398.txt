facing
possible
extradition
to
the

states
adjourned
on
monday
without
deciding
her
fate
prosecutors
want
chief
financial
officer
meng
wanzhou
to
be
extradited
to
face
accusations
she
misled
multinational
banks
about
huawei
s
control
of
a
company
operating
in
iran
putting
the
banks
at
risk
of
violating
sanctions
which
would
incur
severe
penalties
court
documents
said
meng
the
daughter
of
huawei
s
founder
was
arrested
on
as
she
was
changing
planes
in
vancouver
in
a
sworn
affidavit
she
said
she
is
innocent
and
will
contest
the
allegations
against
her
at
trial
if
she
is
surrendered
to
the
united
states
the
judge
in
monday
s
bail
hearing
said
he
rolled
the
proceedings
over
to
tuesday
at
pst
gmt
because
he
wants
to
hear
more
about
the
issue
of
surety
who
will
take
responsibility
for
meng
s
actions
if
she
is
released
meng
s
lawyer
david
martin
who
told
the
court
surveillance
devices
and
a
security
detail
would
ensure
his
client
does
not
flee
and
proposed
a
c
million
million
pounds
bail
guarantee
had
offered
her
husband
as
surety
but
the
judge
and
the
public
prosecutor
called
into
question
whether
meng
s
husband
could
perform
this
duty
as
he
is
not
a
resident
of
british
columbia
where
vancouver
is
located
and
would
not
suffer
if
she
were
to
breach
her
bail
conditions
meng
s
arrest
has
roiled
markets
over
fears
it
would
exacerbate
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
china
already
at
a
high
over
tariffs
the
two
sides
have
agreed
to
trade
negotiations
that
must
be
concluded
by
march
beijing
has
demanded
meng
s
immediate
release
and
threatened
consequences
for
canada
but
both
chinese
and
officials
appear
to
be
avoiding
linking
her
arrest
to
the
trade
dispute
meng
s
lawyer
offered
c
million
in
property
equity
and
c
million
in
cash
as
a
guarantee
the
public
prosecutor
said
he
wanted
half
in
cash
and
half
in
property
at
one
point
the
judge
asked
why
meng
had
avoided
travel
to
the
united
states
since
if
not
to
avoid
arrest
martin
cited
a
hostile
climate
toward
huawei
in
the
united
states
i
ask
the
court
to
ask
itself
what
motive
could
she
possibly
have
to
flee
martin
said
arguing
the
evidence
against
her
was
not
overwhelming
if
she
were
to
flee
or
breach
order
in
any
way
it
doesn
t
overstate
things
to
say
she
would
embarrass
china
meng
appeared
confident
in
court
early
on
monday
smiling
and
taking
her
lawyer
s
arm
but
by
she
appeared
more
tense
gesturing
rapidly
as
she
conferred
with
members
of
her
legal
team
she
has
argued
she
needs
to
be
released
because
she
has
severe
hypertension
and
fears
for
her
health
huawei
is
the
world
s
largest
supplier
of
telecommunications
network
equipment

smartphones
with
revenue
of
about
billion
last
year
unlike
other
big
chinese

does
much
of
its
business
overseas

allege
huawei
was
trying
to
use
the
