exclusive: leading brexit donors say britain will reverse decision to leave eu
london
reuters
two
of
the
biggest
donors
to
the
brexit
campaign
say
they
now
believe
the
project
they
championed
will
eventually
be
abandoned
by
the
government
and
the
united
kingdom
will
stay
in
the
european
union
peter
hargreaves
the
billionaire
who
was
the
second
biggest
donor
to
the
leave
campaign
and
veteran
hedge
fund
manager
crispin
odey
told
reuters
they
expect
britain
to
stay
in
the
eu
despite
their
campaign
victory
in
the
referendum
as
a
result
odey
who
runs
hedge
fund
odey
asset
management
said
he
is
now
positioning
for
the
pound
to
strengthen
after
his
flagship
fund
previously
reaped
the
benefit
of
betting
against
uk
assets
amid
wider
market
fears
about
the
impact
of
brexit
the
donors
pessimism
comes
amid
deadlock
in
britain
s
parliament
over
the
exit
deal
that
prime
minister
theresa
may
has
struck
with
the
eu
which
has
cast
significant
uncertainty
over
how
or
even
if
brexit
will
happen
hargreaves
who
amassed
his
fortune
from
fund
supermarket
hargreaves
lansdown
said
the
political
establishment
were
determined
to
scuttle
brexit
and
this
would
lead
to
a
generation
of
distrust
of
britain
s
political
classes
the
government
he
said
is
likely
to
first
ask
for
an
extension
to
the
formal
exit
process
from
the
eu
and
then
call
for
a
second
referendum
i
have
totally
given
up
i
am
totally
in
despair
i
don
t
think
brexit
will
happen
at
all
said
hargreaves
who
is
one
of
britain
s
wealthiest
men
and
donated
million
pounds
million
to
the
leave
campaign
they
are
banking
on
the
fact
that
people
are
so
fed
up
with
it
that
they
will
just
say
sod
it
we
will
stay
i
do
see
that
attitude
the
problem
is
when
something
doesn
t
happen
for
so
long
you
feel
less
angry
about
turning
brexit
upside
down
would
mark
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
reversals
in
modern
british
history
and
the
hurdles
to
another
referendum
remain
high
both
major
political
parties
are
committed
to
leaving
the
eu
in
accordance
with
the
referendum
but
odey
who
donated
more
than
pounds
to
groups
said
while
he
did
not
believe
a
second
referendum
would
take
place
he
did
not
think
brexit
would
happen
either
my
view
is
that
it
ain
t
going
to
happen
odey
said
i
just
can
t
see
how
it
happens
with
that
configuration
of
britain
s
parliament
is
viewed
as
largely
because
about
of
members
of
parliament
voted
to
stay
in
the
eu
in
the
referendum
odey
said
he
had
changed
his
position
on
sterling
over
the
last
month
and
that
the
pound
looks
like
it
could
be
quite
strong
and
rise
to
or
against
the
dollar
from
around
currently
both
odey
and
hargreaves
said
one
reason
for
their
pessimism
was
a
lack
of
direction
from
brexiteers
the
unfortunate
thing
is
that
almost
nobody
is
leading
the
brexit
charge
so
it
s
leaderless
which
is
the
problem
odey
said
he
said
he
would
be
willing
to
donate
to
the
leave
cause
in
the
event
of
another
referendum
while
hargreaves
said
he
was
undecided
other
prominent
brexit
supporters
who
bankrolled
the
campaign
were
more
optimistic
about
the
project
s
fate
paul
marshall
chairman
of
the
hedge
fund
firm
marshall
wace
which
runs
billion
in
assets
told
reuters
that
abandoning
brexit
would
be
wrong
and
highly
damaging
despite
the
antics
in
parliament
the
prospect
of
the
referendum
being
overturned
is
in
my
view
very
small
said
marshall
who
gave
pounds
to
the
leave
campaign
prior
to
the
vote
marshall
predicted
the
most
likely
outcome
is
that
britain
will
leave
the
eu
without
a
deal
in
march
or
the
government
will
secure
a
revised
brexit
deal
solving
the
thorny
issue
of
the
northern
irish
backstop
which
may
involve
brexit
being
briefly
delayed
another
vocal
brexiteer
tim
martin
the
chairman
of
british
pub
chain
jd
wetherspoon
who
donated
pounds
to
the
campaign
said
he
was
refusing
to
contemplate
a
second
vote
he
is
touring
his
pubs
giving
talks
to
customers
about
the
merits
of
leaving
the
eu
without
a
deal
and
aims
to
have
visited
of
his
sites
by
the
end
of
january
a
second
referendum
would
be
a
nightmare
martin
said
it
s
like
saying
do
you
think
we
should
have
another
world
war
or
what
do
you
think
about
being
struck
by
lightning
