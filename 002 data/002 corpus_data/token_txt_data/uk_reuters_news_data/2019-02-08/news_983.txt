'no-deal' brexit would hit trucks, airlines and pet owners - government papers
london
reuters
leaving
the
european
union
without
a
proper
divorce
deal
could
ground
airlines
stop
hauliers
from
lugging
goods
to
the
world
s
biggest
trading
bloc
and
even
make
headaches
for
pet
owners
who
want
to
take
their
dogs
on
holiday
according
to
government
documents
with
just
six
months
to
go
until
the
united
kingdom
is
due
to
leave
the
eu
on
march
prime
minister
theresa
may
has
warned
that
negotiations
are
at
an
impasse
and
that
the
eu
must
come
up
with
new
proposals
on
how
to
craft
a
divorce
settlement
many
business
chiefs
and
investors
fear
politics
could
scupper
an
agreement
thrusting
the
world
s
fifth
largest
economy
into
a
brexit
that
they
say
would
spook
financial
markets
and
silt
up
the
arteries
of
trade
britain
which
has
warned
it
could
leave
without
a
deal
published
technical
notices
on
monday
covering
everything
from
commercial
road
haulage
and
buying
timber
to
airline
regulations
and
taking
pets
abroad
if
the
uk
leaves
the
eu
in
march
with
no
agreement
in
place
uk
and
eu
licensed
airlines
would
lose
the
automatic
right
to
operate
air
services
between
the
uk
and
the
eu
without
seeking
advance
permission
the
government
said
overall
the
government
has
published
more
than
such
notices
giving
a
glimpse
of
what
a
brexit
the
nightmare
scenario
for
chief
executives
of
most
multinationals
operating
in
britain
would
look
like
amid
warnings
that
trucks
could
stack
up
on
both
sides
of
the
english
channel
in
the
confusion
of
a
no
deal
britain
said
it
would
seek
to
strike
bilateral
agreements
with
european
countries
to
ensure
hauliers
would
retain
access
the
notices
covered
a
vast
swathe
of
the
british
economy
warning
for
example
that
labels
on
packaged
food
would
have
to
be
changed
use
of
the
term
eu
in
origin
labelling
would
no
longer
be
correct
for
food
or
ingredients
from
the
uk
the
government
said
honey
producers
would
have
to
change
their
labels
while
eu
countries
might
not
accept
british
mineral
water
the
government
said
in
the
worse
case
scenario
for
pet
owners
dogs
cats
and
even
ferrets
might
need
health
certificates
and
rabies
jabs
travel
plans
would
have
to
be
discussed
with
a
vet
at
least
four
months
in
advance
before
travelling
to
the
eu
that
would
mean
someone
wanting
to
take
their
pet
to
the
eu
on
march
the
day
after
britain
leaves
the
bloc
would
have
to
discuss
the
trip
with
a
vet
before
the
end
of
november
without
a
deal
the
uk
would
move
from
seamless
trade
with
the
rest
of
the
eu
to
customs
arrangements
set
by
the
world
trade
organization
for
external
states
with
no
preferential
deals
brexiteers
accept
there
is
likely
to
be
some
economic
pain
but
say
the
government
is
trying
to
scare
voters
about
the
impact
of
a
brexit
britain
many
brexiteers
say
will
thrive
in
the
longer
term
if
cut
loose
from
what
they
see
as
a
doomed
experiment
in
unity
and
excessive
welfare
