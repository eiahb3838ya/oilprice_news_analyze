djokovic finds secret to grand slam success in french alps
new
york
reuters
when
novak
djokovic
s
year
got
off
to
a
start
the
serbian
set
off
on
a
hike
in
the
french
alps
that
proved
transformative
since
his
june
trek
with
his
wife
up
mont
the
mountain
that
famously
also
served
as
an
inspiration
for
paul
cezanne
the
has
added
a
pair
of
grand
slam
titles
to
his
resume
i
remember
one
moment
particularly
when
we
climbed
that
mountain
it
was
pretty
high
we
reached
the
top
after
three
hours
djokovic
recalled
after
landing
the
open
title
by
beating
juan
martin
del
potro
on
sunday
we
sat
down
and
we
just
looked
at
the
world
from
that
perspective
just
kind
of
breathed
in
the
new
inspiration
new
motivation
i
thought
of
tennis
thought
of
the
emotion
that
tennis
provokes
in
me
in
a
way
it
was
all
positives
i
just
felt
like
i
had
a
new
breath
for
this
sport
the
rest
is
history
in
terms
of
results
in
terms
of
how
i
felt
i
just
felt
like
a
whole
wave
of
energy
that
i
was
kind
of
thriving
on
from
that
moment
after
missing
the
second
half
of
the
season
because
of
an
elbow
problem
djokovic
played
the
australian
open
before
having
surgery
on
the
joint
only
for
the
disappointing
results
to
continue
until
his
exit
at
roland
garros
something
in
the
alpine
air
clearly
agreed
with
him
though
and
he
went
on
to
triumph
at
wimbledon
the
open
in
cincinnati
and
then
in
new
york
to
grab
his
career
grand
slam
title
putting
him
third
on
the
list
i
had
to
kind
of
disconnect
a
little
bit
said
djokovic
we
just
isolated
ourselves
and
took
things
from
a
different
perspective
ever
since
then
the
tennis
is
completely
different
for
me
in
terms
of
results
i
played
finals
of
queen
s
won
wimbledon
won
cincinnati
and
won
open
i
guess
we
ll
be
hiking
some
more
very
soon
he
added
with
a
smile
in
new
york
while
some
of
his
fiercest
rivals
fell
by
the
wayside
over
a
bruising
fortnight
djokovic
did
not
let
the
intense
heat
or
any
of
his
opponents
push
him
off
his
path
to
a
third
title
at
flushing
meadows
djokovic
will
now
set
his
sights
on
conquering
a
different
summit
by
reclaiming
his
place
atop
the
world
tennis
rankings
for
the
first
time
since
october
admitting
it
would
have
been
hard
to
believe
back
in
february
that
he
would
go
on
to
collect
such
prestigious
titles
this
year
he
also
felt
the
barren
spell
had
actually
helped
get
him
back
on
track
i
learned
a
lot
about
myself
learned
to
be
patient
which
was
never
really
a
stronger
side
of
me
djokovic
said
but
at
the
same
time
life
showed
me
that
it
takes
time
for
good
things
it
takes
time
to
really
build
them
for
things
to
fall
into
place
so
you
can
centre
yourself
balance
yourself
and
thrive
