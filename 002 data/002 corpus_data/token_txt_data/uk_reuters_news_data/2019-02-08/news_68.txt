factbox - the brexit compromise that helped send may back to brussels
london
reuters
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
has
won
the
backing
of
parliament
to
seek
changes
to
her
brexit
deal
thanks
in
large
part
to
a
peace
accord
between
both
eurosceptic
and
factions
within
her
divided
conservative
party
the
strategy
which
emerged
this
week
has
been
dubbed
the
malthouse
compromise
after
one
of
its
proponents
lawmaker
kit
malthouse
it
courts
brexiteers
with
a
promise
to
ditch
an
unpopular
irish
border
policy
in
favour
of
an
alternative
and
appeals
to
conservatives
by
pledging
safeguards
against
the
risk
of
disruption
if
no
exit
deal
can
be
agreed
with
brussels
although
the
plan
takes
its
name
from
junior
housing
minister
malthouse
its
political
weight
come
from
the
senior
figures
who
helped
draft
it
these
include
former
education
minister
nicky
morgan
a
prominent
campaigner
for
close
ties
with
the
european
union
and
jacob
leader
of
a
powerful
conservative
eurosceptic
faction
to
get
any
brexit
deal
ratified
may
needs
to
secure
parliament
s
approval
but
her
party
is
divided
over
the
best
way
to
leave
the
eu
and
earlier
this
month
comprehensively
rejected
an
exit
deal
she
negotiated
with
brussels
without
an
exit
deal
britain
could
face
significant
economic
disruption
the
key
point
of
disagreement
in
britain
is
the
irish
backstop
an
insurance
policy
designed
to
prevent
the
revival
of
border
controls
between
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
and
eu
member
ireland
many
mps
including
the
northern
irish
party
which
props
up
may
s
government
fear
britain
could
end
up
tied
to
eu
rules
indefinitely
or
that
the
backstop
could
drive
a
wedge
between
northern
ireland
and
the
rest
of
the
uk
the
malthouse
plan
has
not
been
set
out
in
a
formal
document
but
based
on
reports
of
leaked
communications
and
statements
by
its
backers
it
can
be
broken
into
two
parts
a
modified
set
of
negotiating
aims
and
a
fallback
option
in
case
that
fails
the
group
backs
an
alternative
withdrawal
agreement
which
is
closely
modelled
on
the
existing
agreement
but
includes
a
different
backstop
arrangement
the
new
backstop
would
be
based
around
a
free
trade
agreement
rather
than
its
current
basis
of
a
shared
customs
area
between
britain
and
the
eu
it
relies
on
technological
solutions
to
move
checks
on
goods
away
from
the
border
this
proposal
was
first
announced
in
december
if
negotiations
with
brussels
fail
the
government
should
seek
a
basic
transition
agreement
involving
an
offer
to
keep
paying
into
the
eu
and
guaranteeing
the
rights
of
eu
citizens
living
in
britain
in
return
britain
wants
to
extend
current
trading
terms
beyond
the
end
of
the
implementation
period
utilising
a
clause
in
international
trade
law
if
a
permanent
trade
arrangement
has
not
been
agreed
by
then
may
s
rejected
divorce
deal
envisages
a
transition
or
implementation
period
till
the
end
of
during
which
trade
would
continue
on
current
terms
may
has
not
fully
endorsed
the
plan
but
it
is
one
of
three
options
she
is
considering
as
she
prepares
to
return
to
brussels
they
are
a
right
for
britain
to
unilaterally
decide
it
will
leave
the
backstop
a
time
limit
on
the
backstop
alternative
backstop
arrangements
along
the
lines
of
those
put
forward
by
malthouse
tuesday
s
vote
in
parliament
allows
may
to
present
a
united
front
in
the
hope
of
persuading
brussels
to
reopen
the
deal
but
it
is
not
specific
about
what
she
must
change
this
raises
the
risk
that
the
peace
deal
in
the
party
is
only
temporary
a
chorus
of
eu
voices
has
dismissed
the
prospect
of
renegotiating
the
legal
text
governing
britain
s
withdrawal
which
was
signed
off
by
all
other
eu
countries
last
year
if
whatever
may
is
able
to
secure
from
the
eu
falls
short
of
her
party
s
expectations
she
could
face
a
repeat
of
the
heavy
defeat
her
original
deal
suffered
in
parliament
may
has
promised
to
report
back
to
parliament
