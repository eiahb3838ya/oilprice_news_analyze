danske
bank
elected
the
favored
candidate
of
its
top
shareholder
as
its
new
chairman
on
friday
to
help
steer
the
danish
lender
through
a
euro
money
laundering
scandal
authorities
in
denmark
estonia
britain
and
the
united
states
are
investigating
payments
totaling
billion
euros
billion
made
through
danske
bank
s
tiny
estonian
branch
between
and
the
threat
of
a
heavy
fine
from
the
department
of
justice
has
sent
danske
s
shares
down
almost
percent
since
march
erasing
around
billion
of
market
value
and
raising
the
prospect
of
legal
action
from
investors
the
maersk
shipping
tycoon
family
the
bank
s
top
shareholder
with
a
percent
stake
ousted
chairman
ole
andersen
and
called
friday
s
shareholder
meeting
to
nominate
karsten
dybvad
and
another
board
member
the
more
than
shareholders
at
the
extraordinary
general
meeting
egm
in
copenhagen
elected
dybvad
to
danske
s
board
the
modified
board
of
directors
then
elected
dybvad
who
for
the
last
eight
years
was
ceo
of
the
confederation
of
danish
industry
one
of
the
country
s
most
influential
lobby
groups
as
its
new
chairman
prior
to
that
he
had
a
long
career
as
a
government
official
working
with
ministers
across
the
danish
political
spectrum
we
hope
and
are
confident
that
karsten
can
contribute
to
the
dialogue
with
authorities
which
probably
will
take
up
a
lot
of
time
in
the
next
couple
of
years
said
robert
maersk
uggla
moller
holding
s
chief
executive
at
the
meeting
besides
restoring
danske
s
image
dybvad
is
also
tasked
with
finding
a
new
chief
executive
to
head
the
bank
and
ensure
potential
legal
cases
not
least
in
the
united
states
don
t
detract
from
business
that
s
the
first
task
dybvad
told
reuters
we
will
look
at
this
with
fresh
eyes
so
it
will
take
some
time
but
then
we
hope
we
can
find
exactly
the
right
ceo
he
said
dybvad
declined
to
say
if
he
saw
current
interim
ceo
jesper
nielsen
as
a
candidate
for
the
role
although
he
said
that
he
was
doing
a
good
job
when
asked
if
he
wanted
the
entire
board
consisting
of
members
three
elected
by
employees
replaced
as
a
measure
to
soothe
authorities
and
thus
try
to
minimize
potential
fines
over
the
money
laundering
scandal
dybvad
said
that
two
members
could
be
elected
at
a
general
meeting
in
three
months
time
in
addition
to
the
two
on
friday
that
s
practically
a
new
board
so
we
ll
push
forward
together
he
said
outgoing
chairman
andersen
and
other
managers
were
criticized
harshly
by
several
private
shareholders
at
the
meeting
there
were
probably
things
that
many
people
should
have
done
differently
and
i
will
of
course
also
reflect
on
whether
there
were
things
i
should
have
done
differently
andersen
told
reuters
after
the
egm
adding
there
probably
is
it
is
probably
primarily
related
to
the
recent
the
investment
firm
of
the
maersk
family
which
controls
shipping
group
is
usually
a
passive
shareholder
however
maersk
uggla
said
they
had
acted
because
they
felt
that
danske
s
board
had
not
moved
fast
enough
to
replace
andersen
the
move
was
welcomed
by
others
at
the
meeting
we
see
this
demonstration
of
active
ownership
as
positive
said
mikael
bak
chief
executive
at
the
danish
shareholders
association
a
lobby
group
for
private
investors
we
would
have
liked
to
see
the
large
shareholders
a
little
earlier
perhaps
far
earlier
he
added
claus
wiinblad
senior
vice
president
at
denmark
s
largest
investor
pension
fund
atp
said
dybvad
faced
big
challenges
there
is
great
task
in
handling
the
ongoing
investigations
in
relation
to
the
estonia
case
in
a
way
that
can
contribute
to
confidence
in
danske
bank
he
said
dybvad
said
he
had
decided
to
prioritize
his
new
job
as
chairman
