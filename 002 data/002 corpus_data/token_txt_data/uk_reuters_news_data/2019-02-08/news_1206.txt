on
said
trump

issue
and
it
was
achieved
lopez
obrador
told
reporters
after
arriving
in
the
southern
state
of
chiapas
we
are
satisfied
because
our
sovereignty
was
saved
mexico
reserves
the
right
to
reform
its
constitution
its
energy
laws
and
it
was
established
that
mexico
s
oil
and
natural
resources
belong
to
our
nation

obrador
opposed
a
constitutional
change
pushed
through
by
mexican
president
enrique

nieto
that

exploration
in
the
energy
sector
to
private
capital
mexico
has
already
awarded
more
than
oil
exploration
and
production
contracts
to
private
companies
lopez
obrador
has
said
he
would
pour
resources
into
state
oil
company
pemex
while
still
respecting
private
sector
contracts
as
long
as
a
review
does
not
find
evidence
of
corruption
he
is
expected
to
slow
down
or
stall
the
process
of
offering
more
contracts
to
private
players

had
agreed

change

overhaul
on
energy
that
had
previously
been
a
cut
and
paste
from
the
text

energy
reform
the
