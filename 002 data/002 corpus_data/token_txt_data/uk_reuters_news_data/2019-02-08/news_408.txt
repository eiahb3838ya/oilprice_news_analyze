belgium
s
africa
museum
will
reopen
to
the
public
on
sunday
after
five
years
of
renovations
designed
to
modernise
the
museum
from
an
exhibition
of
propaganda
to
one
that
is
critical
of
belgium
s
imperialist
past
the
museum
full
of
artefacts
and
stuffed
wildlife
was
often
criticised
for
ignoring
the
brutalities
of
king
leopold
ii
s
fiefdom
whose
troops
collected
the
hands
of
those
who
resisted
slave
labour
at
a
time
when
millions
of
congolese
people
are
estimated
to
have
died
many
of
the
artefacts
remain
but
there
is
more
commentary
from
african
people
on
video
screens
displays
by
congolese
artists
one
including
a
family
tree
in
a
bid
to
centralize
africans
rather
than
europeans
colonial
history
is
now
concentrated
in
one
gallery
rather
than
dominating
the
whole
museum
which
also
deals
with
current
issues
facing
democratic
republic
of
congo
drc
and
its
diaspora
we
also
assume
our
responsibility
that
for
more
than
years
we
ve
diffused
we
ve
disseminated
an
image
of
a
superior
western
way
of
thinking
to
african
cultures
said
museum
director
guido
gryseels
in
the
large
rotunda
a
statue
remains
of
a
european
missionary
with
an
african
boy
clutching
his
robes
with
a
plaque
that
reads
belgium
brings
civilization
to
congo
but
now
the
room
is
dominated
by
a
giant
wooden
sculpture
of
an
african
man
s
head
sculptured
by
an
artist
born
in
drc
the
museum
also
features
a
new
entry
pavilion
many
belgians
remain
ignorant
of
their
country
s
harsh
rule
in
what
is
now
democratic
republic
of
congo
drc
in
the
late
century
it
became
the
setting
for
joseph
conrad
s
influential
novella
heart
of
darkness
belgium
s
colonial
past
made
the
small
european
country
one
of
the
world
s
most
successful
trading
economies
the
million
euros
million
renovation
to
the
africa
museum
set
in
a
palatial
neoclassical
building
in
a
landscaped
park
just
outside
the
capital
brussels
hopes
to
confront
belgians
with
their
colonial
past
but
activists
says
that
by
containing
stolen
artefacts
it
represents
a
continuation
of
colonialism
there
is
no
decolonisation
without
restitution
said
robert
who
was
born
in
the
drc
before
moving
to
belgium
where
she
authored
a
book
on
racism
the
debate
about
whether
art
should
be
returned
home
has
intensified
after
french
president
emmanuel
macron
promised
to
return
some
african
art
to
the
continent
and
germany
this
year
published
guidelines
for
considering
repatriation
gryseels
said
the
museum
was
open
to
returning
some
artefacts
king
philippe
declined
an
invitation
to
attend
the
museum
s
inauguration
on
saturday
but
prime
minister
charles
michel
and
some
ministers
will
attend
activists
will
hold
a
separate
ceremony
nearby
at
the
graves
of
seven
congolese
who
died
of
influenza
when
they
were
imported
for
exhibition
in
a
human
zoo
the
group
is
demanding
belgium
erect
a
plaque
in
remembrance
a
plaque
was
put
up
at
the
location
of
the
human
zoo
while
a
new
exhibit
in
the
museum
casts
the
shadows
of
names
of
congolese
people
who
died
in
belgium
over
those
of
belgians
that
perished
in
africa
