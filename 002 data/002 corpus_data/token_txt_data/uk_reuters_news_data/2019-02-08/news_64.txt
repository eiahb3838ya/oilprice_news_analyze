london

bt
group
s
outgoing
ceo
gavin
patterson
said
he
was
handing
over
a
company
with
the
momentum
needed
to
see
through
a
major
restructuring
and
withstand
pressures
ranging
from
demands
from
regulators
to
aggressive
competition
in
consumer
broadband
philip
jansen
a
former
worldpay
chief
executive
takes
the
helm
at
britain
s
biggest
broadband
provider
on
friday
eight
months
after
patterson
launched
a
plan
to
tackle
financial
and
operational
underperformance
patterson
signed
off
with
third
quarter
numbers
and
a
forecast
that
earnings
would
come
in
at
the
top
end
of
guidance
but
the
outlook
made
clear
the
challenge
facing
jansen
we
continue
to
expect
regulation
competition
cost
inflation
and
legacy
product
declines
to
impact
in
the
short
term
before
being
more
than
offset
by
improved
trading
and
cost
transformation
by
our
financial
year
patterson
said
he
said
in
may
he
would
cut
jobs
to
tackle
problems
ranging
from
criticism
of
bt
s
fibre
broadband
plan
to
an
underperforming
it
services
business
bt
s
shares
down
percent
since
patterson
took
over
in
reversed

early
on

hargreaves
lansdown
analyst
george
salmon
said
patterson
had
had
his
critics
in
recent
years
but
the
results
meant
he
was
leaving
on
an
upbeat
note
that
s
not
to
say
bt
is
out
of
the
woods
though
he
said
competition
is
fierce
in
mobile
and
broadband
and
falling
profits
at
openreach
are
a
timely
reminder
that
regulation
has
the
potential
to
limit
progress
at
any
time
he
said
patterson
said
the
highlights
of
his
tenure
included
buying
britain
s
biggest
mobile
operator
ee
and
moving
into
sports
broadcasting
two
moves
that
transformed
bt
s
consumer
business
put
there
were
negatives
including
an
accounting
scandal
in
italy
two
years
ago
and
a
rocky
relationship
with
britain
s
telcoms
regulator
patterson
said
in
retrospect
he
could
have
launched
the
restructuring
plan
a
year
earlier
time
goes
very
quickly
as
a
ceo
and
you
need
to
move
today
rather
than
move
tomorrow
he
said
bt
said
it
was
stepping
up
planning
for
britain
leaving
the
european
union
in
march
including
a
disorderly
exit
that
it
and
other
businesses
fear
we
need
to
plan
for
all
eventualities
including
a
disorderly
transition
patterson
said
bt
was
building
up
stock
of
key
equipment
such
as
broadband
hubs
and
boxes
in
case
there
were
delays
in
the
supply
chain
he
said
it
was
also
making
sure
it
could
continue
to
serve
customers
through
its
european
subsidiaries
and
would
not
have
problems
moving
data
about
like
everyone
else
we
are
expecting
it
hopefully
to
be
a
negotiated
managed
exit
but
are
prepared
for
the
worst
if
it
were
to
happen
patterson
said
the
stockpiling
costs
would
be
covered
by
its
working
capital
provisions
the
company
said
bt
reported
revenue
of
billion
pounds
down
percent
and
core
earnings
of
billion
pounds
down
percent
for
the
quarter
to
the
end
of
december
beating
analysts
expectations
of
billion
pounds
and
billion
pounds
respectively
revenue
and
earnings
grew
strongly
in
its
consumer
business
helped
by
a
september
price
increase
and
higher
handset
costs
offset
by
a
decline
in
its
enterprise
business
and
in
its
openreach
networks
arm
which
was
hit
by
regulated
price
cuts
it
said
adjusted
core
earnings
for
the
year
to
would
be
around
the
top
end
of
guidance
of
billion
to
billion
pounds
