toyota
motor
corp
s
quarterly
profit
edged
up
as
demand
for
its
car
models
from
chinese

outlook
japan
s
biggest
automaker
attributed
the
smaller
forecast
to
unrealised
losses
from

in
an
indication
that

was
still
strong
it
kept
its

unchanged

the

posted
asian

of

in
the
third

up
percent
from
a
year
earlier
as
strong

as
well

the
pace
is

to

further
this

but
japanese
automakers
such
