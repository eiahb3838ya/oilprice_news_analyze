german economy posts weakest growth in five years
berlin
reuters
the
german
economy
grew
by
percent
in
the
weakest
rate
in
five
years
and
markedly
slower
than
the
previous
year
preliminary
data
showed
on
tuesday
in
a
sign
that
exporters
in
europe
s
largest
economy
are
being
hit
by
trade
tensions
german
companies
are
struggling
with
a
cooling
of
the
global
economy
and
tariff
disputes
triggered
by
president
donald
trump
s
america
first
policies
the
risk
that
britain
will
leave
the
european
union
without
a
deal
in
march
is
another
uncertainty
the
preliminary
gdp
estimate
published
by
the
federal
statistics
office
was
in
line
with
market
expectations
and
compared
with
a
growth
rate
of
percent
in
the
german
economy
thus
grew
the
ninth
year
in
a
row
although
growth
has
lost
momentum
the
statistics
office
said
adding
that
growth
was
mainly
driven
by
domestic
demand
with
household
consumption
and
state
spending
up
on
the
year
company
investments
in
machinery
and
equipment
were
particularly
strong
rising
by
percent
on
the
year
this
helped
to
offset
a
slowdown
in
export
growth
which
nearly
halved
to
percent
from
percent
in
as
imports
grew
at
a
faster
pace
than
exports
net
trade
had
a
slightly
negative
effect
on
overall
growth
the
office
said
measured
with
the
high
expectations
from
one
year
ago
german
economic
growth
was
clearly
disappointing
kfw
chief
economist
joerg
zeuner
said
the
head
of
the
diw
economic
institute
marcel
fratzscher
pointed
to
strong
domestic
activity
and
the
record
state
budget
surplus
of
nearly
billion
euros
billion
which
are
both
seen
driving
growth
this
year
as
well
the
strong
labor
market
with
rising
employment
and
healthy
wage
hikes
will
help
to
maintain
private
consumption
as
the
main
pillar
of
economic
growth
fratzscher
said
the
trade
disputes
and
the
uncertainty
surrounding
a
recession
in
the
in
the
coming
two
years
are
probably
the
biggest
risks
for
the
german
exports
to
china
grew
nearly
percent
from
january
to
november
while
exports
to
britain
fell
by
percent
in
the
same
period
the
office
said
the
overall
impact
of
brexit
on
german
economic
growth
is
impossible
to
quantify
an
official
of
the
statistics
office
told
a
news
conference
in
berlin
british
lawmakers
look
set
to
reject
the
withdrawal
agreement
negotiated
with
the
eu
by
prime
minister
theresa
may
in
a
vote
later
on
tuesday
leaving
unclear
what
form
brexit
on
march
will
take
or
even
if
it
will
happen
at
all
the
statistics
office
said
the
economy
probably
grew
slightly
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
which
would
mean
it
escaped
recession
defined
as
two
or
more
consecutive
quarters
of
negative
growth
there
was
also
a
slightly
positive
statistical
overhang
at
the
end
of
suggesting
the
economy
is
carrying
modest
growth
momentum
into
the
office
said
policymakers
and
economists
are
racking
their
brains
over
how
much
the
slowdown
is
caused
by
factors
or
if
there
are
more
fundamental
structural
problems
at
play
the
statistics
office
pointed
to
domestic
bottlenecks
in
new
car
registrations
due
to
the
introduction
of
stricter
pollution
standards
and
a
summer
drought
that
caused
disruptions
to
deliveries
by
river
ferry
of
fuel
and
other
raw
materials
but
the
economy
s
weak
performance
in
the
fourth
quarter
suggests
that
the
contraction
from
july
to
september
was
more
than
just
a
blip
and
that
germany
has
reached
peak
growth
a
string
of
unexpectedly
weak
data
also
from
other
european
countries
has
pointed
to
a
cooling
in
the
euro
zone
economy
as
a
whole
possibly
making
it
more
difficult
for
the
european
central
bank
to
raise
interest
rates
anytime
soon
