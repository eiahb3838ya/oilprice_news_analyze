ill-prepared suppliers threaten aerospace giants in case of hard brexit
farnborough
england
reuters
airbus
is
stockpiling
parts
in
case
of
a
hard
brexit
and
is
months
away
from
doing
so
but
for
smaller
aerospace
companies
that
supply
them
britain
s
departure
from
the
eu
could
be
much
more
challenging
the
largest
aerospace
sector
in
europe
and
second
in
the
world
behind
the
united
states
the
british
industry
generates
exports
worth
billion
pounds
a
year
and
sustains
direct
jobs
plus
as
many
again
indirectly
manufacturing
planes
and
engines
requires
components
to
be
at
factories
on
a
basis
a
disorderly
or
brexit
would
threaten
the
smooth
flow
of
parts
across
borders
and
prevent
european
regulatory
approval
for
aerospace
products
however
much
planning
the
industry
giants
do
they
could
still
be
damaged
via
their
supply
chains
if
component
suppliers
are
not
ready
john
rainey
chairman
of
denroy
a
maker
of
injected
moulded
components
used
on
airbus
planes
has
contingency
plans
in
place
but
won
t
sign
off
on
any
changes
for
the
company
of
employees
until
he
knows
what
brexit
means
everybody
says
you
need
a
plan
but
we
don
t
know
what
to
plan
for
or
against
we
re
going
to
conferences
now
and
we
re
told
to
be
very
afraid
but
we
don
t
know
what
we
have
to
be
afraid
of
he
said
at
the
farnborough
airshow
the
annual
showcase
for
the
british
aerospace
industry
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
on
march
but
there
is
little
clarity
over
its
future
relationship
with
the
world
s
biggest
trading
bloc
alert
to
the
potential
problem
which
makes
engines
for
aircraft
and
ships
has
started
to
talk
to
smaller
suppliers
to
look
at
where
some
of
the
hotspots
might
be
the
company
s
president
of
civil
aerospace
chris
cholerton
said
we
ve
got
a
bit
of
a
heatmap
of
levels
of
risk
he
said
scenario
slow
progress
in
the
brexit
talks
has
convinced
europe
s
airbus
which
makes
the
wings
for
its
commercial
aircraft
in
wales
to
activate
plans
to
prepare
for
a
scenario
but
few
of
the
companies
in
airbus
s
uk
supply
chain
many
of
which
are
small
and
companies
have
dedicated
teams
and
sophisticated
plans
in
place
a
chink
in
the
armour
of
big
companies
there
s
a
limit
to
how
much
they
big
companies
can
do
in
terms
of
digging
down
said
david
stewart
aerospace
partner
at
consultancy
firm
oliver
wyman
there
s
a
small
company
that
does
this
piece
of
bearing
clip
pump
you
can
t
go
and
check
every
one
of
those
single
companies
to
see
how
well
prepared
they
big
companies
hope
that
building
up
stocks
of
parts
will
allow
factories
to
continue
producing
even
if
goods
are
held
up
at
the
border
between
britain
and
the
eu
depending
on
the
future
relationship
goods
could
require
customs
declarations
and
checks
at
borders
a
major
risk
for
airbus
whose
components
can
cross
borders
two
or
three
times
before
products
are
finished
tony
wood
ceo
of
meggitt
which
makes
wheels
and
brakes
for
planemakers
and
has
employees
globally
says
he
has
examined
how
the
company
would
fare
under
all
the
different
outcomes
we
ve
done
so
many
scenarios
around
brexit
planning
he
said
meggitt
which
said
only
percent
of
its
business
is
trading
directly
between
the
uk
and
europe
says
it
can
cope
with
the
extra
administration
on
day
one
if
there
is
a
requirement
for
extra
processing
and
paperwork
to
clear
customs
and
such
like
then
yes
we
have
a
solution
to
put
people
in
place
to
do
that
wood
said
but
for
northern
denroy
it
s
another
story
rainey
who
owns
the
firm
said
more
paperwork
could
mean
extra
staff
and
extra
cost
for
a
small
business
to
absorb
i
m
worried
about
all
the
additional
documentation
requirements
the
implications
for
two
more
employees
is
quid
pounds
you
know
he
said
the
head
of
france
s
dassault
aviation
eric
trappier
urged
britain
and
the
eu
on
thursday
to
settle
differences
over
brexit
and
define
a
new
partnership
as
quickly
as
possible
to
avoid
hurting
hundreds
of
suppliers
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
published
a
plan
for
the
uk
s
future
relationship
with
the
eu
in
july
which
was
generally
by
industry
but
even
if
she
can
secure
enough
support
for
it
at
home
she
still
needs
to
win
agreement
from
the
eu
under
her
plan
britain
would
share
a
common
rule
book
on
goods
with
the
eu
and
continue
to
participate
in
the
european
aviation
safety
agency
easa
addressing
a
key
worry
for
the
industry
which
needs
its
parts
to
be
to
continue
flying
if
that
fails
companies
with
existing
facilities
in
mainland
europe
can
use
those
for
approving
parts
with
six
factories
in
europe
meggitt
has
options
there
are
a
number
of
alternatives
as
to
how
you
ultimately
will
clear
those
parts
we
have
operations
in
france
and
switzerland
wood
said
adding
that
shipping
parts
there
for
easa
approval
would
be
a
very
extreme
scenario
rolls
is
one
step
ahead
putting
in
place
plans
to
move
the
design
approval
process
for
its
large
jet
engines
from
britain
to
germany
but
setting
up
shop
in
europe
isn
t
an
option
for
many
of
the
thousands
of
small
and
companies
and
the
aerospace
and
defence
industry
body
ads
said
it
isn
t
advising
them
to
move
or
seeing
evidence
that
they
re
doing
so
at
this
point
we
re
saying
you
do
need
to
be
aware
you
need
to
have
understood
where
the
vulnerabilities
lie

chief
executive
paul
everitt
said
while
the
costs
of
brexit
are
worrying
for
some
some
smaller
companies
see
an
opportunity
in
the
regulatory
and
customs
difficulties
that
could
lie
ahead
the
boss
of
moyola
precision
engineering
a
supplier
of
titanium
and
aluminium
components
to
airbus
and
boeing
said
it
could
win
new
business
if
it
adapts
quickly
enough
it
employs
people
at
its
base
in
northern
ireland
over
the
years
we
have
been
working
to
reduce
our
cost
and
to
put
ourselves
in
a
situation
where
we
can
still
be
cost
competitive
said
managing
director
mark
semple
who
owns
the
million
pound
turnover
business
with
his
father
you
have
to
keep
doing
these
things
brexit
s
just
another
thing
that
encourages
you
to
look
to
continue
to
take
out
pounds
