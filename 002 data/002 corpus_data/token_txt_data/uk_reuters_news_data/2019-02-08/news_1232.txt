the
irish

endured
its
worst
strike
earlier
in

after
a
by
pilots
in
five
european
countries
disrupted
the
plans
of
an
estimated
people
at
the
height
of
the
summer
holiday
season
that
included
a
fifth
walkout
of
the
summer
by
around
a
quarter
of

that
prompted

to

ended
early
on
thursday
after

stuck
in
negotiations

are
watching
the
irish
talks
closely
although
dutch
pilots
union
vnv
saw
little
read
across
saying
the
irish
agreement
did
not
appear
to
cover
all
the
issues
at
stake
and
was
limited
to
base
transfers
and
promotions
we
shall
have
to
study
the
details
but
for
now
we
don
t
see
much
in
this
agreement
for
us
to
build
on
as
we
have
different
priorities
vnv
spokesman
joost
van

his
assessment
on
documents
the
union
had
seen
so
far
dutch
pilots
were
among
those
that
took
part
in
the
strike
ryanair
employs
more
than
pilots
with
around
of
them
based
in
ireland
negotiations
in
the
country
have
been
among
the
most
difficult
the
company
has
said
shares
in
ryanair
were
percent
higher
at
euros
at
gmt
top
of
the
regional
stoxx
benchmark
index
the
stock
is
still
down
percent
since
the
strike
action
ramped
up
in
and
remains
below
the
euros
it
slumped
to
in
december
when
ryanair
shocked
markets
by
agreeing
to
recognise
unions
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
