the
world
trade
organization
set
up
a
dispute
panel
on
friday
to
rule
on
a
complaint
against
restrictions
in
canada
s
province
of
british
columbia
on
wine
sales
in
grocery
stores
a
wto
official
said
in
line
with
wto
rules
the
decision
was
taken
after
canada
made
its
second
request
at
a
meeting
of
the
wto
s
dispute
settlement
body
the
delegation
said
that
british
columbia
s
regulations
exclude
all
imported
wine
from
grocery
store
shelves
and
violated
wto
rules
on
trade
officials
said
the
restrictions
limited
sales
opportunities
for
american
wine
in
canada
and
gave
a
substantial
competitive
advantage
to
local
wines
it
said
canada
questioned
the
commercial
rationale
for
the
move
noting
that
imported
wines
account
for
around
percent
of
all
wine
sales
and
there
were
nearly
points
of
sale
for
imported
wine
in
the
province
the
european
union
australia
new
zealand
argentina
and
chile
were
among
those
reserving
their
third
party
rights
in
the
wto
dispute
