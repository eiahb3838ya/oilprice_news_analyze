u.s. sanctions venezuela officials, trump slams maduro
new
reuters
the
united
states
imposed
new
sanctions
on
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
s
wife
and
several
of
his
top
allies
on
tuesday
as
president
donald
trump
urged
members
of
the
united
nations
to
support
a
restoration
of
democracy
in
the
opec
nation
the
measure
sanctioned
six
officials
in
maduro
s
inner
circle
including
vice
president
delcy
rodriguez
and
defense
minister
vladimir
padrino
and
blocked
a
million
private
jet
identified
as
belonging
to
a
of
a
top
official
the
move
adds
pressure
to
a
government
already
widely
criticised
for
economic
collapse
and
undermining
democracy
but
it
does
not
materially
change
washington
s
efforts
to
pressure
socialist
party
stalwarts
who
have
shown
no
willingness
to
hand
over
power
or
negotiate
a
transition
today
socialism
has
bankrupted
the
nation
and
driven
its
people
into
abject
poverty
trump
said
in
remarks
to
the
united
nations
general
assembly
we
ask
the
nations
gathered
here
to
join
us
in
calling
for
the
restoration
of
democracy
in
venezuela
he
said
separately
a
group
of
latin
american
nations
will
present
a
complaint
in
new
york
on
wednesday
against
the
maduro
administration
for
alleged
human
rights
abuses
to
be
investigated
by
the
international
criminal
court
officials
said
peru
colombia
paraguay
chile
and
argentina
will
be
joined
by
canada
in
submitting
the
initiative
against
venezuela
s
government
according
to
two
officials
familiar
with
the
plans
under
maduro
venezuela
has
limited
the
powers
of
the
legislature
jailed
opposition
politicians
and
created
a
parallel
congress
with
unlimited
powers
inflation
is
running
at
percent
and
basic
foods
and
medicines
like
rice
and
antibiotics
are
increasingly
difficult
to
obtain
that
has
fuelled
an
exodus
of
venezuelans
to
nearby
latin
american
countries
where
borders
are
now
overwhelmed
by
venezuelan
migrants
maduro
says
he
is
the
victim
of
an
economic
war
led
by
adversaries
he
denies
limiting
political
freedoms
insisting
opposition
leaders
have
plotted
assassination
attempts
and
sought
to
overthrow
him
through
violent
street
protests
on
tuesday
he
said
trump
s
comments
were
an
apology
for
america
s
history
of
colonialism
in
the
region
and
offered
words
of
support
for
the
sanctioned
officials
who
joined
him
during
an
event
broadcast
over
state
television
i
m
surrounded
by
sanctioned
officials
he
said
thank
you
donald
trump
for
surrounding
me
with
he
nonetheless
said
he
hoped
to
arrange
a
meeting
with
trump
the
white
house
responded
to
a
similar
request
last
year
by
saying
such
a
meeting
would
happen
when
the
country
returned
to
democracy
the
trump
administration
has
levied
several
rounds
of
sanctions
against
maduro
s
government
since
sanctions
such
as
those
published
on
tuesday
bar
american
citizens
and
companies
from
any
dealings
with
the
individuals
in
question
which
blocks
them
from
holding
bank
accounts
or
contracting
services
from
firms
more
personal
sanctions
can
maybe
deprive
top
venezuelan
officials
from
some
gains
but
this
will
hardly
destabilise
the
regime
said
raul
gallegos
associate
director
of
consultancy
control
risks
a
broader
set
of
financial
sanctions
created
last
year
bar
american
investors
from
acquiring
newly
issued
debt
effectively
locking
the
country
out
of
credit
markets
and
further
fuelling
its
problems
a
group
of
senators
said
on
tuesday
they
had
introduced
legislation
seeking
to
address
the
crisis
in
venezuela
by
among
other
things
tightening
sanctions
and
providing
million
million
in
humanitarian
aid
vice
president
mike
pence
separately
said
on
tuesday
the
united
states
would
provide
an
additional
million
to
partners
in
the
region
to
confront
the
humanitarian
crisis
caused
by
the
growing
migration
of
venezuelans
the
migration
and
refugees
organizations
said
in
a
joint
statement
in
august
that
million
venezuelans
are
currently
living
abroad
and
more
than
million
have
left
since
venezuela
does
not
release
migration
figures
but
maduro
said
in
september
no
more
than
venezuelans
had
migrated
in
the
past
two
years
and
that
percent
of
them
want
to
return
maduro
has
hung
on
to
power
in
part
because
of
continued
support
of
members
of
the
armed
forces
such
as
padrino
who
was
appointed
defence
minister
in
the
treasury
said
padrino
helped
ensure
the
military
s
loyalty
to
maduro
in
the
past
it
has
accused
officers
of
corruption
and
undermining
human
rights
first
lady
cilia
flores
a
lawyer
and
former
attorney
general
who
also
ran
venezuela
s
legislature
frequently
appears
at
public
events
with
maduro
and
is
seen
an
important
power
broker

also
said
a
gulfstream

jet
located
in
florida
had
been
identified
as
belonging
to
a

the
