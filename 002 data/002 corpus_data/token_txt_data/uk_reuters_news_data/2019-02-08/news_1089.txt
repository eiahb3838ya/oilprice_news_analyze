wednesday
that
north
korea
was
taking
a
lot
of
steps
towards
denuclearising
the
korean
peninsula
but
washington
was
not
responding
and
was
making
endless

disarmament
instead
washington
and
pyongyang
have
been
discussing
north
korea
s
nuclear
programme
since
their
leaders
met
in
singapore
in

though
that
summit
s
outcome
was
criticised
for
being
short
on
details
about
how
and
whether
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
was
willing
to
give
up
weapons
that
threaten
the
united
states
putin
speaking
at
an
economic

city

vladivostok
said
pyongyang
had
taken
positive
steps
and
was
now
waiting
for
a
response
he
said
it
was
if
one
side
did
a
lot
and
the
other
did
nothing
if
north
korea
does
something
towards
denuclearisation
it
expects
reciprocal
steps
and
not
endless
demands
for
full
disarmament
said
putin
putin
said
it
was
also
important
that
north
korea
received
international
guarantees
about
its
own
security
and
said
kim
jong
un
was
welcome
to
visit
russia
at
any
time
that
was
convenient
for
him
