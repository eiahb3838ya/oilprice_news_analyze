eu's barnier says time too short for alternatives to irish backstop
paris
reuters
time
is
too
short
to
find
an
alternative
arrangement
to
the
irish
backstop
and
britain
s
divorce
deal
with
the
european
union
will
not
be
for
negotiation
the
eu
chief
brexit
negotiator
michel
barnier
said
on
wednesday
we
ourselves
talked
of
alternative
arrangements
which
could
prevent
the
return
of
a
hard
border
only
no
one
on
either
side
was
able
to
say
what
arrangement
would
be
needed
to
ensure
controls
on
goods
animals
and
merchandise
without
having
a
border
barnier
told
france
s
rtl
radio
we
have
neither
the
time
nor
the
barnier
expressed
hope
that
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
meeting
with
opposition
leader
jeremy
corbyn
might
yield
new
proposals
he
said
the
eu
was
ready
to
a
political
declaration
outlining
ambitions
for
a
future
trade
deal
with
britain
we
re
open
to
being
more
ambitious
and
perhaps
put
into
perspective
that
which
is
causing
a
problem
in
the
withdrawal
