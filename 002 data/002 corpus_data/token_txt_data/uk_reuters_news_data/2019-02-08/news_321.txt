the
comments
on
kovrig
from
the

were
made
in
recent
days
all
the

requested
anonymity
citing
the
sensitivity

the
situation
under

special

detention
and
interrogation
can
be
used
for
state
security
suspects
rights
groups
say
conditions
in
chinese
detention
facilities
are
often
basic
and
can
be
harsh
with
lack
of
legal
representation
and
due
process
compounding
worries
about
treatment
in
a
british
corporate
investigator
accused
chinese
officials
of
deliberately
withholding
medical
treatment
while
he
was
in
jail
to
try
to
force
him
to
confess
to
a
role
in
a
scandal

while

location
according
to
hong
amnesty
international
east
asia
research

joshua
rosenzweig
previous
reported
experiences
of
individuals
held
under
this
measure
have
included
prolonged
questioning
close
and
constant
monitoring
and
sleep
deprivation
rosenzweig
said
both
the
united
nations
and
amnesty
have
singled
out
this
form
of
detention
as
creating
a
potent
environment
for
abuse
aimed
at
extracting
confessions
which
are
highly
prized
in
china
s
criminal
justice
system
he
said
foreign
ministry
spokeswoman
hua
chunying
said
on
friday
the
details
of
kovrig
s
detention
and
treatment
needed
to
be
checked
and
referred
specific
questions
to
the
relevant
authorities
the
ministry
of
state
security
which
is
leading
the
investigation
into
kovrig
has
no
publicly
available
contact
details
we
have
already
said
that
china
has
in
accordance
with
the
law
guaranteed
michael
kovrig
s
lawful
rights
and
humanitarian
treatment
hua
told
a
daily
news
briefing
canada
has
been
provided
necessary
help
to
get
consular
access
she
said
i
don
t
know
whether
you
paid
attention
to
the
treatment
or
the
human
rights
of
the
chinese
citizen
who
was
illegally
detained
in
canada
at
the
request
of
the
united
states
hua
said
referring
to
huawei
s
meng
a
canadian
court
last
week
granted
meng
bail
among
conditions
of
her
bail
the
executive
must
wear
an
ankle
monitor
and
stay
at
home
from
to
the
canadian
government
has
said
several
times
it
saw
no
explicit
link
between
the
arrest
of
meng
the
daughter
of
huawei
s
founder
and
the
detentions
of
kovrig
and
spavor
but
western
diplomats
and
former
canadian
diplomats
have
said
they
believed
the
detention
of
the
canadians
were
a
reprisal
by
china
if
a
canadian
judge
rules
the
case
against
meng
is
strong
enough
canada
s
justice
minister
must
next
decide
whether
to
extradite
her
to
the
united
states
if
so
meng
would
face
charges
of
conspiracy
to
defraud
multiple
financial
institutions

been
revealed
about
spavor
s
detention
china
