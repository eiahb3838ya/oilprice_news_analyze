london

iran
s
parliament
voted
on
tuesday
to
reject
president
hassan
rouhani
s
explanations
for
economic
hardship
after
a
dramatic
grilling
on
live
tv
a
sign
his
pragmatic
faction
is
losing
sway
to
hardline
rivals
as
new
sanctions
begin
to
bite
the
vote
in
parliament
came
two
days
after
lawmakers
sacked
the
minister
of
economy
and
finance
and
weeks
after
they
sacked
the
labour
minister
blaming
them
for
the
collapse
of
the
rial
currency
and
surging
inflation
rouhani
won
two
landslide
elections
on
a
platform
of
economic
reform
and
opening
iran
up
to
the
outside
world
and
his
pragmatic
supporters
have
a
majority
in
the
parliament
but
his
reputation
and
political
influence
have
taken
a
sharp
hit
as
his
promised
economic
gains
have
failed
to
materialise
his
highest
profile
achievement
was
to
negotiate
the
lifting
of
financial
sanctions
on
iran
in
a
deal
with
world
powers
over
its
nuclear
programme
but
president
donald
trump
pulled
out
in
may
and
washington
has
sanctions
rouhani
spoke
out
in
parliament
in
defence
of
his
economic
record
blaming
the
country
s
woes
on
the
sanctions
rather
than
his
team
s
management
but
a
majority
of
lawmakers
voted
to
reject
his
explanation
in
four
out
of
five
areas
there
were
conflicting
reports
about
what
would
follow
from
the
vote
several
iranian
news
agencies
said
rouhani
s
case
would
now
be
referred
to
the
judiciary
although
the
spokesman
for
the
parliamentary
leadership
behrouz
nemati
said
lawmakers
must
hold
further
discussion
before
that
would
take
place
the
action
in
parliament
is
a
further
sign
of
how
the
trump
administration
s
decision
to
sanctions
could
affect
iran
s
leadership
and
its
relationship
with
the
outside
world
potentially
for
decades
to
come
iran
s
rulers
have
been
divided
between
a
pragmatic
faction
that
aims
for
better
international
relations
and
hardliners
who
are
wary
of
reforms
trump
s
decision
to
abandon
the
nuclear
deal
was
opposed
by
allies
in
europe
who
argued
that
he
undermined
rouhani
and
strengthened
the
hands
of
the
hardliners
while
rouhani
and
his
cabinet
run
iran
s
affairs
ultimate
authority
lies
with
the
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
in
power
since
weakening
the
pragmatists
now
could
affect
the
choice
of
khamenei
s
successor
for
now
rouhani
s
own
position
appears
safe
the
judiciary
could
determine
that
he
broke
the
law
and
parliament
has
the
power
to
impeach
him
but
experts
on
iranian
politics
say
power
struggles
are
more
likely
to
play
out
indirectly
the
parliament
s
move
is
politically
motivated
and
indicates
that
tensions
would
increase
in
the
islamic
republic
in
coming
months
saeed

an
iranian
economist
told
reuters
by
telephone
from
tehran
iranian
political
factions
have
always
used
international
issues
to
pursue
their
domestic
gains
he
added
after
the
sacking
of
the
two
ministers
this
month
tasnim
news
agency
reported
that
lawmakers
had
signed
a
motion
to
impeach
a
third
the
minister
of
industry
mines
and
business
rouhani
has
bowed
to
pressure
and
fired
the
head
of
the
central
bank
a
deputy
central
bank
governor
was
arrested
by
the
judiciary
on
corruption
charges
in
a
crackdown
that
also
saw
foreign
exchange
dealers
rounded
up
the
lawmakers
asked
rouhani
on
tuesday
about
five
subjects
unemployment
slow
economic
growth
the
fall
of
the
rial
smuggling
and
the
lack
of
access
by
iranian
banks
to
global
financial
services
the
parliament
found
only
rouhani
s
answer
about
banks
satisfactory
i
want
to
assure
the
iranian
nation
that
we
will
not
allow
the
plot
against
the
islamic
republic
to
succeed
rouhani
told
parliament
we
will
not
let
this
bunch
of
in
the
white
house
be
able
to
plot
against
iran
s
official
unemployment
rate
is
percent
with
youth
unemployment
as
high
as
percent
in
a
country
where
percent
of
the
million
population
is
under
the
rial
has
lost
more
than
of
its
value
in
a
year
iran
s
economy
has
suffered
not
only
from
sanctions
but
also
from
pervasive
corruption
and
the
concentration
of
its
wealth
and
trade
in
the
hands
of
big
firms
controlled
by
the
hardline
revolutionary
guards
military
force
washington
imposed
a
new
round
of
sanctions
in
august
targeting
iran
s
trade
in
gold
and
other
precious
metals
its
purchases
of
dollars
and
its
car
industry
worse
is
yet
to
come
with
a
new
round
of
sanctions
to
be
imposed
in
november
that
washington
says
aims
to
cut
iran
s
oil
exports
to
zero
the
plunge
in
the
currency
and
soaring
inflation
have
sparked
sporadic
demonstrations
against
profiteering
and
corruption
with
many
protesters
chanting
slogans
against
both
the
government
and
supreme
leader
khamenei
rouhani
said
such
protests
had
encouraged
trump
to
try
to
provoke
more
unrest
by
harming
iran
s
economy
the
protests
tempted
trump
to
withdraw
from
the
nuclear
deal
he
said
asking
lawmakers
to
support
his
cabinet
and
not
add
to
sentiment
although
the
economic
problems
were
critical
rouhani
said
more
important
than
that
is
that
many
people
have
lost
their
faith
in
the
future
of
the
islamic
republic
and
are
in
doubt
