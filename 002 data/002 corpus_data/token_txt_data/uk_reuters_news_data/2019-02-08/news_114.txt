central bank policy tightening: damned if they do, damned if they don't
london
reuters
central
banks
may
be
about
to
face
one
of
their
biggest
challenges
yet
global
economic
growth
is
slowing
but
they
have
struggled
to
build
up
their
policy
arsenals
since
the
last
crisis
to
effectively
deal
with
another
one
the
trade
war
worries
about
britain
s
imminent
departure
from
the
european
union
a
potential
recession
in
italy
and
unrest
in
south
america
all
pose
risks
for
the
global
economy
while
the
federal
reserve
embarked
on
its
current
tightening
cycle
back
in
december
the
european
central
bank
bank
of
england
and
bank
of
japan
still
have
interest
rates
at
or
near
policymakers
want
to
start
raising
borrowing
costs
so
they
have
more
room
to
manoeuvre
if
there
is
another
downturn
but
they
risk
fanning
the
slowdown
hundreds
of
economists
polled
by
reuters
this
month
think
is
already
underway
central
banks
are
also
facing
increasing
pressure
from
governments
to
keep
policy
loose
bringing
their
independence
into
question
president
donald
trump
has
taken
a
swipe
at
the
fed
italy
has
put
pressure
on
the
ecb
to
extend
its
asset
purchases
and
indian
prime
minister
narendra
modi
has
made
it
clear
to
the
reserve
bank
of
india
that
he
wants
stimulative
monetary
policy
ahead
of
national
elections
in
may
with
the
global
economy
likely
to
slow
over
the
coming
quarters
it
seems
more
likely
that
central
banks
will
continue
to
come
under
fire
from
populist
leaders
said
neil
shearing
group
chief
economist
at
capital
economics
but
most
central
banks
target
inflation
not
growth
tighter
policy
usually
strengthens
currencies
while
reducing
consumer
and
business
spending
which
should
keep
inflation
lower
but
it
also
risks
curtailing
what
is
pretty
scant
growth
in
many
countries
the
bank
of
japan
has
been
targeting
inflation
of
percent
for
years
without
success
it
is
not
expected
to
start
normalizing
its
extremely
loose
monetary
policy
until
or
later
ecb
president
mario
draghi
may
also
have
to
wait
a
long
time
before
policy
is
tightened
he
acknowledged
on
thursday
that
growth
in
the
euro
zone
was
likely
to
be
weaker
than
previously
expected
although
the
bank
stuck
to
its
guidance
that
it
intends
to
raise
interest
rates
later
this
year
for
the
first
time
in
a
decade
it
is
now
expected
to
wait
until
the
fourth
quarter
to
raise
its
deposit
rate
however
later
than
thought
a
month
ago
only
of
economists
polled
by
reuters
this
month
were
confident
the
ecb
would
be
able
to
raise
rates
before
the
next
downturn
the
risks
surrounding
the
euro
area
growth
outlook
have
moved
to
the
downside
on
account
of
the
persistence
of
uncertainties
draghi
told
a
news
conference
citing
trade
and
geopolitical
threats
emerging
market
volatility
and
brexit
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
in
a
little
over
two
months
but
there
is
still
huge
uncertainty
about
what
relationship
the
two
sides
will
have
come
brexit
day
on
march
bank
rate
in
the
uk
has
been
at
just
percent
since
august
and
in
a
reuters
poll
this
month
expectations
for
a
hike
next
quarter
were
pushed
back
to
july
at
the
earliest
as
the
potential
for
a
brexit
remains
high
prime
minister
theresa
may
is
engaged
in
a
bid
to
win
support
for
a
tweaked
divorce
deal
after
parliament
this
month
crushed
the
original
plan
in
the
biggest
defeat
in
modern
british
history
her
finance
minister
philip
hammond
said
the
economy
would
suffer
severe
damage
if
the
united
kingdom
left
the
eu
without
a
deal
that
would
leave
little
scope
for
the
boe
to
be
tightening
policy
anytime
soon
across
the
ocean
median
predictions
suggest
the
fed
will
raise
rates
twice
this
year
although
nearly
of
economists
polled
by
reuters
predicted
the
central
bank
would
either
hike
rates
only
once
or
keep
the
fed
funds
rate
unchanged
at
percent
in
monetary
policy
tightening
is
pretty
much
over
and
the
ecb
seems
set
to
miss
the
boat
altogether
in
this
cycle
said
andrew
kenningham
chief
euro
zone
economist
at
capital
economics
a
further
escalation
in
the
trade
war
president
trump
is
waging
on
china
the
world
s
economy
would
likely
lead
to
an
even
sharper
global
slowdown
this
year
economists
said
under
pressure
from
faltering
domestic
demand
and
bruising
tariffs
china
s
economy
cooled
in
the
fourth
quarter
reducing
growth
to
a
near
low
and
pressuring
beijing
to
roll
out
more
stimulus
to
avert
a
sharper
slowdown
