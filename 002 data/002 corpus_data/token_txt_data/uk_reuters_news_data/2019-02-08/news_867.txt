says
she
is
convinced
that

alam
instigated
trouble

spreading
what
she
describes
as
false
news
about
protests
against
her
rule
in

in
an
exclusive
interview
with
reuters
hasina
described
alam
who
is
known
as
one
of
south
asia
s
preeminent
photographers
as
mentally
sick
and
blamed
his
behaviour
on
his
family
background
alam
s
great
uncle
was
on
the
opposing
side
to
hasina
s
father
in
bangladesh
s
war
of
independence
from

she

for
her
accusations
which
alam
s
family
and
lawyer
reject
alam
was
arrested
in
august
hours
after
criticizing
the
government
s
response
to
widespread
student
protests
his
detention
has
been
widely
seen
as
a
test
for
freedom
of
speech
in
the
country
and
has
sparked
worldwide
demands
for
his
release
hasina
who
was
returned
unopposed
in
after
the
opposition
boycotted
the
poll
is
seeking
a
third
term
in
an
election
at
the
end
of
december
against
a
backdrop
of
growing
dissent
at
what
critics
believe
is
her
increasingly
authoritarian
government
you
are
now
guilty
until
proven
innocent
we
have
a
reverse
system
said
ataur
rahman
a
professor
of
political
science
at
dhaka
university
people
don
t
want
to
be
engaged
in
debates
in
case
they
end
up
like
told
of
hasina
s
comments
alam
s
family
said
the
government
had
already
decided
on
his
guilt
before
a
trial
can
be
held
it
shows
they
have
already
made
their
judgement
said
alam
s
niece
dilruba
karim
she
added
that
hasina
s
comments
are
hugely
cruel
and
don
t
befit
the
leader
of
a
democracy
anisul
huq
a
cabinet
minister
who
handles
legal
affairs
in
hasina
s
government
said
the
country
s
judicial
system
has
full
independence
and
freedom
alam
a
critic
of
hasina
s
awami
league
is
being
investigated
under
a
controversial
section
of
the
information
and
communication
technology
act
which
human
rights
watch
says
has
been
used
by
hasina
s
government
in
a
number
of
arbitrary
detentions
of
government
critics
and
is
one
of
several
laws
that
have
been
used
to
stifle
free
speech
the
new
committee
to
protect
journalists
has
called
the
case
rife
with
due
process
violations
an
accusation
that
huq
denied
alam
s
lawyer
shahdeen
malik
said
his
comments
during
the
protests
did
not
constitute
a
criminal
offence
and
that
hasina
s
remarks
regarding
alam
s
uncle
suggested
a
feudal
justice
system
hasina
s
government
has
also
introduced
laws
that
prescribe
jail
time
for
those
spreading
propaganda
against
the
country
while
her
main
political
rival
bangladesh
nationalist
party
leader
khaleda
zia
is
in
jail
on
corruption
charges
she
claims
were
part
of
a
plot
to
prevent
her
from
challenging
hasina
the
government
firmly
denies
it
has
interfered
with
freedom
of
speech
no
government
has
safeguarded
and
upheld
principles
of
freedom
of
expression
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
press
as
much
as
this
government
of
hasina
has
done
huq
said
alam
was
detained
for
what
the
government
says
was
misleading
reporting
on
the
demonstrations
that
began
because
of
the
deaths
of
two
school
students
in
a
traffic
accident
before
escalating
into
the
widest
protests
in
years
alam
says
he
was
covering
the
demonstrations
as
a
photojournalist
in
one
of
a
dozen
facebook
videos
he
posted
from
the
protest
site
alam
said
he
had
been
attacked
and
had
his
camera
smashed
by
goons
wielding
metal
rods
and
sticks
from
the
chhatra
league
a
student
movement
affiliated
with
the
ruling
awami
league
he
later
posted
a
photograph
he
said
showed
men
from
the
movement
wearing
masks
and
being
allowed
to
disrupt
the
protests
in
full
view
of
police
officers
biplob
barua
a
senior
leader
in
the
awami
league
said
the
allegations
made
by
alam
in
the
facebook
videos
about
attacks
on
students
and
the
failure
of
the
police
to
act
were
totally
false
and
had
provoked
additional
violence
photographs
of
protesters
being
attacked
by
young
men
are
widely
available
online
but
reuters
could
not
verify
what
group
the
assailants
belonged
to
alam
was
picked
up
hours
after
giving
an
interview
to
al
jazeera
in
which
he
accused
the
government
of
involvement
in
extrajudicial
killings
in
the
past
the
government
has
denied
allegations
of
sanctioning
extrajudicial
killings
in
its
controversial
campaign
hasina
said
in
the
interview
with
reuters
in
new
york
late
last
month
that
alam
had
spread
false
news
as
authorities
were
trying
to
calm
the
students
he
tried
to
use
this
situation
to
instigate
it
she
said
we
tried
to
save
the
children
but
he
tried
to
use
these
children
all
the
false
news
he
started
how
can
you
accept
it
in
the
interview
she
also
sharply
criticized
alam
s
deceased
great
uncle
abdus
sabur
khan
a
former
government
minister
who
opposed
bangladesh
s
independence
and
allied
with
pakistan
he
opposed
our
liberation
war
he
joined
pakistan
he
didn
t
accept
bangladesh
in
he
was
with
the
pakistani
occupation
army
hasina
said
sometimes
blood
speaks
you
understand
the
war
for
independence
is
still
a
sensitive
topic
in
the
country
a
new
law
called
the
digital
security
act
signed
into
law
by
the
nation
s
president
on
monday
despite
protests
from
local
journalists
and
the
united
states
stipulates
a
maximum
jail
sentence
of
years
for
several
offences
including
secretly
recording
inside
government
buildings
and
spreading
propaganda
against
bangladesh
s
war
for
independence
hasina
told
reuters
that
reporters
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
digital
security
act
if
they
have
confidence
that
they
will
not
do
anything
wrong
then
why
should
they
worry
