emerging markets brought the bears, now they have the bulls
london
reuters
this
weekend
marks
a
year
since
the
start
of
one
of
most
comprehensive
global
bear
markets
on
record
but
just
as
the
developing
world
s
equity
indexes
were
first
to
fold
last
year
now
they
are
leading
the
charge
back
up
although
there
are
a
few
subtleties
this
time
it
largely
fits
with
a
pattern
that
stretches
back
decades
during
the
global
financial
crisis
emerging
market
stocks
dropped
the
percent
that
defines
a
bear
market
three
weeks
sooner
than
the
main
global
indexes
and
started
to
bounce
back
four
months
earlier
it
was
a
similar
story
in
and
when
the
bubble
deflated
in
back
then
em
also
started
to
fall
three
weeks
earlier
took
less
than
a
third
of
the
time
to
reach
bear
territory
and
bottomed
out
months
sooner
you
just
have
more
volatility
and
a
faster
moving
investor
base
in
emerging
markets
said
kiran
at
pictet
asset
management
so
when
fear
tends
to
take
over
the
market
that
can
be
a
really
interesting
buying
last
year
s
rout
saw
em
and
global
indexes
actually
start
their
slides
within
hours
of
each
other
but
there
were
still
plenty
of
familiar
patterns
to
observe
china
s
heavy
falls
and
even
bigger
hits
for
the
likes
of
turkey
meant
msci
s
em
index
was
a
bear
market
by
september
whereas
the
all
world
index
held
out
until
christmas
tech
bulls
were
still
pushing
the
s
p
and
nasdaq
to
record
highs
up
until
late
september
and
early
october
at
that
point
china
was
down
percent
em
overall
had
lost
percent
and
turkey
and
argentina
had
already
troughed
but
em
has
led
the
rebound
too
msci
em
began
to
claw
up
at
the
end
of
october
two
months
earlier
than
the
world
index
analysts
at
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
reckon
funds
have
been
putting
money
into
em
stocks
for
the
last
weeks
and
this
month
the
index
is
up
percent
which
is
nearly
as
much
as
it
surged
last
january
before
buckling
so
badly
we
have
seen
more
interest
in
em
assets
for
several
months
said
aberdeen
standard
s
head
of
global
strategy
andrew
milligan
another
remarkable
symmetry
is
that
almost
a
year
to
the
day
since
the
bears
first
attacked
turkish
stocks
have
came
full
circle
and
achieved
bull
market
status
percent
up
from
their
lows
it
has
been
brazil
that
has
really
set
pace
in
that
respect
though
its
main
stock
market
started
to
rebound
from
a
percent
drop
in
june
and
was
already
a
bull
market
by
the
time
but
jair
bolsonaro
won
the
first
round
of
presidential
elections
in
early
october
brazilian
stocks
are
now
up
percent
from
their
lows
and
at
an
high
aviva
investors
head
of
funds
sunil
krishnan
started
buying
up
more
em
assets
back
in
november
if
we
are
right
that
macro
is
in
reasonable
shape
and
at
least
in
some
areas
trade
dialogue
between
the
and
china
will
improve
and
chinese
authorities
will
be
more
aggressive
with
stimulus
then
it
should
be
a
constructive
year
