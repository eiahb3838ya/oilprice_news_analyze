shi'ite rivalry paralyses iraq's government
baghdad
reuters
a
growing
rivalry
between
two
powerful
shi
ite
muslim
factions
has
paralysed
efforts
to
form
a
government
in
iraq
six
months
after
an
election
aimed
at
steering
the
country
towards
recovery
from
years
of
war
the
two
largest
parliamentary
groupings
to
emerge
after
the
vote
in
may
one
led
by
populist
cleric
moqtada
and
the
other
by
militia
leader
hadi
formed
a
tacit
alliance
in
october
when
they
picked
a
president
and
approved
out
of
cabinet
ministers
but
since
then
there
has
been
stalemate
mainly
over
the
empty
interior
ministry
post
dominated
for
years
by
allies
of
amiri
who
are
backing
the
former
head
of
a
paramilitary
force
supported
by
tehran
sadr
meanwhile
says
no
one
with
a
political
affiliation
should
get
the
post
a
vote
in
parliament
to
fill
the
vacant
ministries
in
prime
minister
adel
abdul
mahdi
s
cabinet
has
been
repeatedly
put
back
iraq
s
return
to
deadlocked
parliamentary
politics
now
involving
shi
ite
factions
rather
than
the
ite
sectarianism
that
followed
the
invasion
prompted
a
plea
last
week
from
iraq
s
most
senior
shi
ite
cleric
for
politicians
to
work
together
that
now
looks
all
but
impossible
as
grand
ayatollah
ali
made
his
remarks
the
two
sides
broke
off
talks
lawmakers
said
we
reached
a
dead
end
hanin
qaddo
a
member
of
the
bloc
led
by
amiri
told
reuters
on
friday
there
s
no
need
for
more
delays
no
use
in
talks
mp
ahmed
said
we
will
go
to
parliament
and
vote
for
the
rest
of
the
he
said
they
would
do
this
without
agreement
from
sadr
s
supporters
even
though
the
parliamentary
arithmetic
is
against
them
sadr
on
monday
urged
abdul
mahdi
to
present
the
rest
of
his
cabinet
to
parliament
for
approval
as
soon
as
possible
without
disputed
candidates
you
must
not
submit
to
what
is
going
on
behind
the
scenes
sadr
told
the
prime
minister
sadr
whose
alliance
won
the
most
parliamentary
seats
in
the
election
has
threatened
to
walk
out
of
the
political
process
and
stage
mass
demonstrations
as
he
has
done
in
the
past
notably
when
protesters
stormed
baghdad
s
fortified
green
zone
in
if
bina
amiri
s
bloc
ignores
us
then
we
will
resort
to
all
possible
options
including
mobilising
the
street
said
a
member
of
sadr
s
alliance
who
declined
to
give
his
name
whether
sadr
s
is
imminent
or
not
the
confrontation
is
paralysing
efforts
to
rebuild
a
country
wrecked
by
its
war
with
islamic
state
and
provide
services
in
poor
areas
flash
floods
killed
several
people
last
month
and
militants
still
stage
attacks
local
officials
blame
political
infighting
for
failure
to
deliver
services
there
s
no
reconstruction
or
jobs
here
said
sheikh
abu
mashan
a
tribal
leader
in
anbar
province
main
electricity
lines
are
still
down
at
first
they
said
we
d
get
power
by
october
now
they
say
january
authorities
have
no
interest
in
us
they
ve
spent
nearly
seven
months
talking
and
still
have
no
the
deadlock
also
means
a
budget
has
not
been
passed
so
provinces
do
not
know
how
much
they
will
have
to
spend
on
fixing
services

said
we
don
t
even
have
enough
money
to
fix
roads
damaged
by
abdul
mahdi
was
seen
by
many
parties
as
a
compromise
candidate
for
the
post
of
prime
minister
who
might
form
a
government
of
independent
technocrats
capable
of
delivering
services
and
reducing
unemployment
the
causes
of
protests
that
turned
violent
in
september
he
was
approved
by
both
parliamentary
groupings
which
include
sunni
parties
sunnis
and
kurds
also
hold
cabinet
posts
but
the
power
struggle
between
sadr
and
amiri
has
removed
the
initiative
from
the
prime
minister
s
hands
and
away
from
parliament
analysts
say
it
s
not
up
to
him
and
it
s
not
up
to
the
parliamentarians
neither
the
executive
nor
the
legislative
branches
of
government
have
a
say
in
forming
the
next
cabinet
said
renad
mansour
a
research
fellow
at
chatham
house
a
london
there
s
no
leader
yet
who
s
able
to
sit
the
two
sides
together
and
get
to
the
bottom
of
who
will
be
interior
minister
it
s
become
a
matter
of
these
divisions
among
shi
ite
leaders
could
weaken
iranian
influence
in
iraq
which
has
grown
since
the
overthrow
of
saddam
hussein
years
ago
if
the
split
persists
iran
would
prefer
to
see
amiri
and
his
fellow
militia
leaders
in
a
strong
position
but
while
iran
will
try
to
stop
the
divisions
getting
any
worse
there
is
no
sign
yet
that
it
has
mediated
between
the
two
factions
lawmakers
from
sadr
s
parliamentary
group
said
they
sent
a
message
last
week
to
amiri
s
candidate
for
interior
minister
falih
the
former
head
of
a
grouping
that
comprises
iraq
s
shi
ite
militias
asking
him
to
step
down
mps
in
amiri
s
bloc
told
reuters
they
would
try
to
push
fayyadh
through
parliament
after
giving
up
on
talks
with
the
sadists
without
agreement
from
sadr
however
the
vote
is
unlikely
to
pass
putting
further
pressure
on
abdul
mahdi
s
government
despite
the
difficulties
the
prime
minister
is
facing
in
nominating
interior
and
defence
ministers
he
should
complete
this
formation
and
present
names
otherwise
his
government
can
not
really
continue
like
this
said
dhiaa
a
top
adviser
to
sadr
the
defence
ministry
is
also
in
play
but
the
interior
post
is
the
main
sticking
point
asadi
said
sadr
would
give
abdul
mahdi
up
to
six
months
to
form
a
full
cabinet
before
withdrawing
support
pressure
is
also
coming
from
amiri
s
side
if
abdul
mahdi
is
convinced
that
fayyadh
is
the
right
candidate
he
needs
to
present
him
said
qais
a
militia
leader
whose
political
wing
has
contributed
lawmakers
to
amiri
s
bloc
the
prime
minister
doesn
t
currently
have
a
majority
bloc
in
parliament
that
would
support
his
government
for
four
years
