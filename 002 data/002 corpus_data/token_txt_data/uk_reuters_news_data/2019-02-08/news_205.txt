president
donald
trump
on
monday
rejected
a
republican
call
for
temporarily
reopening
shuttered
government
agencies
in
order
to
encourage
negotiations
with
democrats
on
border
security
issues
as
a
partial
government
shutdown
limped
through
its
day
about
of
federal
operations
have
been
partially
closed
by
a
lack
of
funding
since
after
trump
demanded
billion
this
year
from
congress
for
building
a
security
wall
on
the
southwest
border
at
a
speech
to
an
american
farm
bureau
convention
in
new
orleans
trump
again
urged
congress
to
grant
him
the
money
saying
drones
sensors
and
other
technology
can
not
do
what
a
wall
can
do
to
stop
illegal
border
crossings
farmers
a
key
bloc
of
trump
supporters
have
been
hit
by
the
shutdown
as
federal
loan
and
farm
aid
applications
have
stalled
and
key
farming
and
crop
data
has
been
delayed
if
you
want
to
help
farmers

democratic
leader
chuck
schumer
said
in
a
twitter
posting
the
number
of
airport
security
screeners
not
showing
up
for
work
continued
to
rise
since
the
start
of
the
disruption
most
transportation
security
administration
workers
were
required
to
report
to
work
but
they
are
not
being
paid
due
to
a
lack
of
funds
tsa
spokesman
michael
bilello
on
monday
said
tsa
had
a
percent
unscheduled
absence
rate
nationally
compared
to
a
percent
rate
a
year
ago
many
security
officers
are
understandably
looking
for
other
work
to
make
ends
meet
house
of
representatives
homeland
security
chairman
bennie
thompson
a
democrat
said
in
a
statement
democrats
who
control
the
house
have
rejected
trump
s
billion
billion
pounds
demand
as
have
senate
democrats
who
are
needed
to
pass
most
legislation
in
the
chamber
even
though
republicans
hold
a
majority
on
sunday
republican
senator
lindsey
graham
urged
trump
to
reopen
the
government
for
a
short
period
of
time
in
an
effort
to
restart
talks
it
is
an
idea
that
democrats
have
been
promoting
for
weeks
that
was
a
suggestion
that
lindsey
made
but
i
did
reject
it
trump
told
reporters
as
he
left
the
white
house
for
louisiana
i
want
to
get
it
solved
i
don
t
want
to
just
delay
the
partial
shutdown
is
the
longest
in
history
and
has
seen
trump
lurch
from
one
idea
to
another
in
an
attempt
to
secure
money
for
building
a
wall
that
he
argues
is
needed
to
secure
the
united
states
against
illegal
immigrants
and
drugs
democrats
say
there
are
cheaper
more
effective
ways
of
enhancing
border
security
than
constructing
a
wall
that
could
cost
well
beyond
billion
they
have
offered
billion
in
new
border
security
funds
this
year
to
help
pay
for
a
range
of
and
other
tools
at
the
border
when
he
ran
for
president
trump
said
mexico
would
pay
for
the
wall
but
its
government
has
refused
more
recently
he
has
suggested
that
a
renegotiated
trade
deal
with
mexico
could
bring
in
the
revenues
needed
to
build
the
wall
or
that
military
funds
and
soldiers
could
be
utilized
last
week
the
administration
was
looking
into
trump
declaring
a
national
emergency
and
redirecting
army
corps
of
engineers
funds
to
the
wall
but
he
has
said
would
not
immediately
take
such
action
in
december
trump
said
he
would
take
responsibility
for
the
shutdown
but
has
since
shifted
the
blame
to
democrats
a
growing
proportion
of
americans
blame
trump
for
the
closures
