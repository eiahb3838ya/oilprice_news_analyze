the
war
in
yemen
and
blame
the
saudi
crown
prince
for
the
murder
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
the
votes
were
largely
symbolic
because
to
become
law
the
resolutions
would
have
to
pass
the
house
of
representatives
whose
republican
leaders
have
blocked
any
legislation
intended
to
rebuke
the
saudis
in
a
historic
move
senators
voted
to
end
military
support
for
the
coalition
in
yemen
s
civil
war
the
conflict
has
killed
tens
of
thousands
of
people
and
spawned
what
the
united
nations
calls
the
world
s
most
dire
human
crisis
with
the
country
on
the
brink
of
famine
it
was
the
first
time
either
chamber
of
congress
had
backed
a
resolution
to
withdraw
forces
from
a
military
engagement
under
the
war
powers
act
that
law
passed
in
limits
the
president
s
ability
to
commit
forces
to
potential
hostilities
without
congressional
approval
seven
of
trump
s
fellow
republicans
joined
senate
democrats
to
back
the
measure
immediately
after
the
yemen
vote
the
senate
backed
a
resolution
blaming
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
for
khashoggi
s
murder
and
insisting
that
saudi
arabia
hold
accountable
anyone
responsible
for
his
death
khashoggi
a
resident
who
was
a
columnist
for
the
washington
post
was
killed
inside
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
in
october
the
senate
vote
which
was
unanimous
puts
pressure
on
house
leaders
to
allow
a
vote
on
the
khashoggi
resolution
this
month
before
congress
adjourns
for
the
year
unanimously
the
united
states
senate
has
said
that
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
is
responsible
for
the
murder
of
jamal
khashoggi
that
is
a
strong
statement
i
think
it
speaks
to
the
values
that
we
hold
dear
said
republican
senator
bob
corker
chairman
of
the
foreign
relations
committee
and
sponsor
of
the
resolution
trump
has
said
he
wants
washington
to
stand
by
the
saudi
government
and
the
prince
despite
a
cia
assessment
it
was
likely
he
ordered
khashoggi
s
killing
he
promised
to
veto
the
war
powers
resolution
opponents
of
the
resolution
are
reluctant
to
take
any
action
to
disrupt
the
strategic
relationship
with
saudi
arabia
seen
as
an
essential
counterweight
in
the
middle
east
to
iran
of
close
ally
israel
administration
officials
also
see
saudi
support
as
a
linchpin
for
an
peace
plan
yet
to
be
unveiled
by
the
trump
administration
and
they
have
argued
that
ending
support
could
complicate
yemen
peace
talks
asked
to
comment
on
the
khashoggi
resolution
a
white
house
spokesperson
noted
sanctions
imposed
on
saudis
over
the
killing
and
said
our
shared
strategic
interests
with
the
kingdom
of
saudi
arabia
remain
and
we
continue
to
view
as
achievable
the
twin
imperatives
of
protecting
america
and
holding
accountable
those
responsible
for
the
but
backers
of
the
resolutions
including
some
republicans
promised
to
press
ahead
on

a
bipartisan
group
of
senators
promised
to
push
in
the
new
congress
legislation
for
humanitarian
sanctions
and
a
ban
on
weapons
sales
to
saudi
arabia
what
s
next
is
to
do
everything
possible
to
demand
that
the
house
of
representatives
do
what
the
members
of
the
house
want
done
an
opportunity
to
vote
on
this
senator
bernie
sanders
told
reuters
sanders
an
independent
who
caucuses
with
democrats

he
would
bring
the
resolution
up
again
after
the
new
congress
convenes
in
january
when
democrats
will
control
the
house
of
representatives
the
measure
could
pass
the
senate
again
given
the
bipartisan
support
it
received
on
thursday
even
though
trump
s
republicans
will
have
a
larger
majority
in
the
upper
chamber
next
year
i
think
we
re
going
to
win
in
the
senate
and
i
think
we
are
going
to
do
what
the
american
people
want
that
is
to
end
our
participation
in
this
horrific
and
destructive
war
