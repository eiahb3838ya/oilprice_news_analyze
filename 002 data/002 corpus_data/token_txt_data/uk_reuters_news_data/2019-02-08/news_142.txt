jakarta

indonesia
s
president
said
on
tuesday
a
radical
muslim
cleric
linked
to
the
bali
bombings
would
only
be
released
from
jail
if
he
pledged
loyalty
to
the
state
and
its
ideology
after
news
he
would
be
freed
unconditionally
sparked
criticism
president
joko
widodo
had
declared
last
week
that
abu
bakar
bashir
would
be
freed
on
humanitarian
grounds
citing
his
age
and
poor
health
a
legal
adviser
to
the
president
had
said
the
cleric
would
be
granted
unconditional
release
but
widodo
said
in
a
statement
on
tuesday
it
would
be
conditional
release
a
day
after
the
chief
security
minister
said
the
decision
was
being
reviewed
conditions
have
to
be
fulfilled
like
loyalty
to
the
unitary
state
of
indonesia
to
the
pancasila
that
is
one
of
the
very
basic
conditions
said
widodo
convicts
eligible
for
early
release
are
required
to
pledge
loyalty
to
the
state
and
its
secular
ideology
known
as
pancasila
and
not
to
repeat
their
crimes
but
bashir
s
lawyers
say
he
has
refused
to
do
that
bashir
was
the
spiritual
leader
of
jemaah
islamiah
ji
an
islamist
group
linked
to
al
qaeda
blamed
for
the
bombing
of
nightclubs
on
bali
island
that
killed
more
than
people
most
of
them
tourists
including
australians
he
was
convicted
in
under
laws
for
links
to
militant
training
camps
in
aceh
province
and
jailed
for
years
although
linked
to
the
bali
attacks
and
a
bombing
at
jakarta
s
marriott
hotel
in
bashir
was
never
convicted
for
them
and
denied
those
ties
australian
prime
minister
scott
morrison
speaking
before
widodo
set
out
conditions
for
bashir
s
release
urged
indonesia
not
to
show
him
leniency
we
have
been
very
clear
about
the
need
to
ensure
that
as
part
of
our
joint
efforts
that
abu
bakar
bashir
would
not
be
in
any
position
or
in
any
way
able
to
influence
or
incite
anything
morrison
told
reporters
on
monday
widodo
has
also
come
under
fire
at
home
over
the
possible
release
critics
have
accused
him
of
trying
to
win
over
religious
conservatives
ahead
of
a
presidential
election
set
for
april
in
the
world
s
largest
country
some
members
of
the
ruling
coalition
including
officials
in
widodo
s
party
fear
bashir
s
release
could
alienate
moderate
muslim
and
voters
everyone
is
asking
how
can
we
possibly
allow
this
said
an
official
from
widodo
s
democratic
party
of
struggle
now
it
s
about
how
many
votes
we
will
lose
not
most
opinion
polls
have
given
widodo
a
lead
over
rival
prabowo
subianto
a
retired
general
who
had
also
contested
the
presidency
in
opponents
and
hardline
islamists
have
repeatedly
attacked
widodo
s
islamic
credentials
during
the
campaign
for
the
presidency
he
had
to
battle
false
rumours
he
was
a
communist
in
a
move
to
shore
up
muslim
support
this
time
widodo
picked
for
his
running
mate
an
islamic
cleric
still
some
analysts
doubted
whether
releasing
bashir
early
would
win
widodo
many
conservative
voters
security
and
government
officials
who
declined
to
be
identified
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
issue
said
they
backed
the
plan
to
release
bashir
to
avoid
the
risk
of
him
dying
as
a
martyr
in
jail
but
felt
doing
so
without
conditions
was
risky
another
official
said
the
government
was
considering
letting
bashir
out
of
jail
but
placing
him
under
house
arrest
terrorism
expert
sidney
jones
told
reuters
that
waiving
the
requirement
for
bashir
to
pledge
loyalty
to
the
state
and
secular
state
ideology
would
have
set
a
dangerous
precedent
it
risks
turning
him
into
even
more
of
a
hero
because
it
s
like
he
has
succeeded
in
defying
the
state
she
said
speaking
before
widodo
set
conditions
on
the
release
the
end
result
is
that
widodo
ends
up
looking
weak
and
poorly
bill
mcneil
an
survivor
of
the
bombings
told
the
australian
newspaper
that
he
found
the
prospect
of
bashir
s
release
hard
to
understand
it
seems
sort
of
crazy
they
will
execute
people
for
drug
offences
but
allow
this
guy
to
go
free
