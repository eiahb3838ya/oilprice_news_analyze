germany
s
bsi
cyber
defence
agency
on
saturday
defended
its
role
in
responding
to
a
data
breach
saying
it
could
not
have
connected
individual
cases
it
was
aware
of
last
year
until
the
entire
data
release
became
public
the
government
said
on
friday
that
personal
data
and
documents
from
hundreds
of
german
politicians
and
public
figures
including
chancellor
angela
merkel
had
been
published
online
in
what
appeared
to
be
one
of
germany
s
biggest
data
breaches
the
incident
has
shocked
the
establishment
and
prompted
calls
for
security
agencies
to
clarify
whether
any
security
deficiencies
they
were
aware
of
had
been
exploited
and
if
they
could
have
acted
sooner
to
head
off
the
breach
the
bsi
said
in
a
statement
that
it
was
contacted
by
a
lawmaker
in
early
december
about
suspicious
activity
on
their
private
email
and
social
media
accounts
only
by
becoming
aware
of
the
release
of
the
data
sets
via
the
twitter
account
on
could
the
bsi
in
a
further
analysis
on
connect
this
case
and
four
other
cases
that
the
bsi
became
aware
of
during
it
said
at
the
beginning
of
december
it
was
not
foreseeable
that
there
would
be
more
the
bsi
said
on
friday
all
but
one
of
the
seven
parties
in
the
lower
house
had
been
affected
german
media
said
that
party
was
the
alternative
for
germany
afd
last
year
lawmakers
said
a
powerful
cyber
attack
had
breached
the
foreign
ministry
s
computer
network
security
officials
have
blamed
most
previous
breaches
of
data
security
on
a
russian
hacking
group
while
the
kremlin
has
consistently
denied
involvement
in
such
incidents
after
the
latest
data
breach
justice
minister
katarina
barley
said
she
was
considering
stricter
security
requirements
for
software
makers
and
internet
platform
operators
we
are
examining
the
extent
to
which
stricter
legal
provisions
are
useful
and
necessary
here
she
told
weekly
newspaper
welt
am
sonntag
according
to
a
article
authorities
were
investigating
all
possibilities
including
espionage
one
government
source
said
on
friday
adding
that
it
was
unlikely
any
single
person
could
have
compiled
the
massive
amounts
of
data
that
had
been
released
the
bsi
said
investigations
so
far
had
showed
the
data
breaches
predominantly
concerned
private
and
personal
accounts
but
that
it
is
responsible
for
the
operational
protection
of
government
networks
