said
on

he
had
separated
from
his
wife
marina

and
the
couple
will
divorce
the
press
association
reported
johnson
is
the
bookmakers
favourite
to
succeed
prime
minister
theresa
may
and
is
seen
as
someone
who
would
lead
britain
to
a
more
radical
departure
from
the
european
union
after
being
the
figurehead
of
the
leave
campaign
in
in
a
joint
statement
johnson
and
wheeler
said
they
separated
some
time
ago
and
divorce
proceedings
had
started
johnson
s
former
adviser
confirmed
that
a
statement
had
been
issued
to
the
press
association
the
statement
came
after
the
sun
newspaper
ran
a
front
page
story
saying
the
couple
who
have
four
children
had
separated
several
months
ago
after
years
of
marriage
we
decided
it
was
in
our
best
interests
to
separate
we
have
subsequently
agreed
to
divorce
and
that
process
is
under
way
the
statement
said
according
to
the
press
association
reuters
attempted
to
contact
johnson
a
former
mayor
of
london
directly
through
phone
calls
to
his
office
and
by
email
johnson
is
one
of
the
most
recognisable
figures
in
british
politics
thanks
to
his
shock
of
blonde
hair
and
colourful
turn
of
phrase
advocates
of
brexit
say
he
is
the
man
who
should
succeed
may
and
he
is
popular
with
the
party
s
grassroots
he
s
still
the
favourite
said
bookmaker
william
hill
spokesman
joe
crilly
commenting
on
the
odds
of
johnson
being
the
party
s
next
leader
over
the
years
boris
has
been
very
teflon
we
think
he
s
got
more
than
a
couple
of
lives
left
johnson
served
as
foreign
minister
under
may
for
two
years
until
july
when
he
quit
in
protest
at
her
brexit
negotiating
strategy
saying
it
would
leave
britain
as
a
colony
of
the
european
union
since
then
he
has
repeatedly
criticised
the
strategy
in
parliament
and
through
his
regular
newspaper
column
may
s
future
and
the
direction
the
country
will
take
at
its
most
significant
strategic
juncture
since
the
end
of
world
war
two
is
subject
to
intense
scrutiny
as
britain
enters
the
final
phases
of
brexit
negotiations
ahead
of
a
march
eu
exit
her
plan
has
little
support
in
brussels
which
says
she
needs
to
agree
to
further
concessions
to
make
the
plan
workable
and
within
her
party
where
eurosceptics
say
she
has
already
conceded
too
much
ground
by
seeking
a
common
rule
book
to
permit
free
trade
in
goods
i
think
if
the
government
was
to
fall
then
he
would
probably
prosper
at
the
point
of
maximum
chaos
but
if
she
gets
through
brexit
i
can
not
see
him
becoming
leader
