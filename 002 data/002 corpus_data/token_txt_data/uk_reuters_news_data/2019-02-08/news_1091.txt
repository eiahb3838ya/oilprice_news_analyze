hungary's orban vows to defy eu pressure ahead of unprecedented vote
strasbourg
france
reuters
hungarian
prime
minister
viktor
orban
told
the
european
parliament
on
tuesday
he
would
not
bow
to
eu
blackmail
as
lawmakers
prepared
to
vote
on
whether
to
punish
budapest
for
eroding
democracy
some
momentum
might
have
been
building
against
orban
during
the
evening
ahead
of
the
wednesday
vote
but
it
was
still
unclear
whether
the
european
parliament
would
be
able
to
muster
the
majority
needed
to
pass
the
censure
motion
which
accuses
hungary
of
breaching
core
eu
values
since
sweeping
to
power
in
orban
has
pressured
hungary
s
courts
media
and
groups
as
well
as
refusing
to
take
in
asylum
seekers
arriving
in
europe
though
the
european
union
has
often
protested
it
has
largely
failed
to
stop
what
his
critics
decry
as
his
growing
authoritarianism
if
approved
the
motion
would
go
to
the
eu
s
national
leaders
theoretically
opening
the
way
for
sanctions
such
as
a
suspension
of
hungary
s
voting
rights
in
the
bloc
but
in
practice
that
is
sure
to
be
blocked
by
orban
s
ally
the
nationalist
government
in
poland
that
is
locked
in
its
own
dispute
with
the
eu
over
undercutting
the
rule
of
law
directly
addressing
eu
lawmakers
in
strasbourg
orban
cast
wednesday
s
vote
as
an
act
of
revenge
for
his
refusal
to
host
refugees
who
have
fled
to
europe
from
the
middle
east
and
north
africa
since
hungary
shall
not
bow
to
blackmail
said
orban
whose
fidesz
party
was
with
a
landslide
majority
last
april
hungary
shall
continue
to
defend
its
borders
stop
illegal
immigration
and
defend
its
rights
against
you
too
if
necessary
he
said
drawing
applause
from
the
eurosceptic
lawmakers
in
the
assembly
orban
has
said
the
mostly
muslim
refugees
pose
an
existential
threat
to
europe
s
christian
civilisation
he
has
also
waged
a
vociferous
campaign
against
jewish
american
billionaire
philanthropist
george
soros
and
the
liberal
causes
he
backs
in
eastern
europe
the
motion
against
orban
s
hungary
goes
well
beyond
the
migration
issue
the
deputy
head
of
the
european
commission
frans
timmermans
said
on
tuesday
he
shared
its
authors
concerns
about
fundamental
rights
corruption
the
treatment
of
roma
and
the
independence
of
the
judiciary
in
hungary
under
orban
former
belgian
prime
minister
guy
verhofstadt
a
leading
liberal
said
hungary
would
never
have
been
allowed
to
join
the
eu
in
had
it
been
back
then
as
it
has
now
become
under
orban
the
group
of
leftists
and
greens
in
the
assembly
said
orban
s
authoritarian
moves
must
be
curbed
dutch
lawmaker
sophie
in
t
veld
urged
the
eu
to
consider
cutting
generous
subsidies
to
hungary
asking
why
are
we
giving
mr
orban
million
euros
a
week
in
order
to
destroy
the
european
union
even
orban
s
fellow
migration
hardliner
austria
s
chancellor
sebastian
kurz
unexpectedly
said
his
party
s
five
european
lawmakers
would
vote
against
budapest
we
believe
that
there
can
be
no
compromises
on
the
rule
of
law
and
democracy
kurz
told
orf
television
greek
members
of
the
group
were
planning
to
do
the
same
but
italy
s
interior
minister
matteo
salvini
said
his
league
party
s
six
eu
lawmakers
would
support
orban
the
parties
of
kurz
and
orban
both
belong
to
the
biggest
faction
in
the
european
parliament
the
conservative
european
people
s
party
epp
which
also
includes
lawmakers
from
the
party
of
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
the
epp
membership
has
muted
eu
reaction
to
orban
s
policies
over
the
years
and
the
big
question
mark
is
what
the
group
s
members
will
now
do
the
vote
represents
a
particular
challenge
for
epp
s
german
head
manfred
weber
since
he
announced
his
bid
for
the
presidency
of
the
eu
s
executive
commission
next
year
on
tuesday
weber
said
the
eu
might
need
to
consider
launching
the
sanctions
procedure
under
article
of
the
bloc
s
lisbon
treaty
if
budapest
did
not
address
the
criticisms
the
epp
decided
on
tuesday
evening
that
its
lawmakers
would
vote
freely
without
a
unified
stance
from
the
whole
group
orban
might
have
lost
some
key
allies
as
epp
lawmakers
said
their
caucus
meeting
showed
many
would
vote
in
favour
of
article
but
the
vote
was
still
hard
to
call
to
become
the
case
of
the
european
parliament
asking
eu
capitals
to
launch
the
punitive
mechanism
against
one
of
their
own
it
must
win
the
backing
of
at
least
lawmakers
and
two
thirds
of
the
votes
cast
