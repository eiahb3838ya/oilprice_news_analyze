sweden seeks way out of political gridlock after far-right gains
stockholm
reuters
swedish
political
parties
face
weeks
of
haggling
to
form
a
government
after
voters
delivered
a
hung
parliament
on
sunday
with
the
sweden
democrats
saying
they
hold
the
balance
of
power
a
preliminary
allocation
of
parliamentary
seats
gave
the
bloc
uniting
the
minority
governing
social
democrat
and
green
parties
with
the
left
party
seats
versus
for
the
alliance
bloc
the
sweden
democrats
who
want
to
leave
the
european
union
won
seats
up
from
in
the
riksdag
where
seats
are
needed
to
form
a
majority
doing
a
deal
with
them
would
give
either
bloc
a
majority
but
the
mainstream
parties
have
ruled
out
cooperating
with
a
party
which
has
roots
in
the
white
supremacist
fringe
both
blocs
have
declared
themselves
victors
in
the
election
but
need
additional
support
to
form
a
viable
government
without
the
sweden
democrats
who
want
influence
over
immigration
policy
there
are
a
number
of
ways
out
of
the
tangle
minority
rule
the
alliance
of
the
moderates
centre
liberals
and
christian
democrats
looks
set
to
be
slightly
smaller
than
the
but
it
will
hope
for
backing
from
the
sweden
democrats
to
oust
prime
minister
stefan
lofven
and
to
install
moderate
leader
ulf
kristersson
as
his
replacement
however
a
formal
agreement
with
the
sweden
democrats
would
very
likely
see
the
centre
and
liberal
parties
who
want
looser
immigration
policies
jump
ship
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
centre
and
liberal
parties
would
take
part
in
a
government
that
had
no
formal
support
from
the
sweden
democrats
but
in
practice
relied
on
their
votes
to
install
a
prime
minister
on
monday
sweden
democrats
leader
jimmie
akesson
invited
the
moderates
and
christian
democrats
to
formal
negotiations
but
was
quickly
rebuffed
akesson
said
his
party
would
vote
against
any
government
that
did
not
give
it
a
say
in
policy
the
social
democrats
and
greens
could
retain
power
in
the
unlikely
event
that
prime
minister
lofven
survives
a
mandatory
vote
on
whether
to
replace
him
lofven
said
he
would
remain
in
office
in
the
coming
weeks
and
called
for
cooperation
across
the
political
divide
when
voting
for
a
prime
minister
in
parliament
a
proposal
is
passed
unless
a
majority
of
all
lawmakers
vote
against
this
has
allowed
minority
governments
to
rule
the
alliance
would
need
the
sweden
democrats
to
back
a
vote
to
oust
lofven
and
install
kristersson
the
alliance
could
join
a
grand
coalition
with
the
social
democrats
and
possibly
the
greens
to
exclude
the
sweden
democrats
the
left
party
sweden
s
former
communist
party
would
also
be
left
out
but
the
moderates
the
biggest
party
in
the
alliance
are
not
interested
in
cooperating
with
the
social
democrats
and
such
a
deal
would
also
raise
questions
about
democratic
accountability
voters
might
see
the
sweden
democrats
as
the
country
s
only
opposition
party
moderate
rule
the
moderates
could
form
a
government
but
that
would
require
support
from
the
sweden
democrats
as
well
as
the
smaller
parties
moderate
leader
kristersson
has
ruled
this
out
and
the
centre
and
liberal
parties
would
probably
not
go
along
with
the
idea
if
the
sweden
democrats
were
given
any
significant
say
over
policy
while
remaining
outside
the
government
parliament
opens
on
if
lofven
is
ousted
the
speaker
is
allowed
to
give
a
maximum
of
four
prime
ministerial
candidates
the
opportunity
to
form
a
government
if
they
all
fail
fresh
elections
must
be
called
there
is
no
formal
time
limit
for
negotiations
but
the
deadline
for
the
budget
is
if
no
new
government
is
in
place
by
then
the
current
government
continuing
as
caretakers
would
put
forward
a
budget
until
a
new
cabinet
can
take
office
