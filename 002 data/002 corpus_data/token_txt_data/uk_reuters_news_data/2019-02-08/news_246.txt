denmark
says
it
foiled
a
iranian
intelligence
plan
to
assassinate
an
iranian
arab
opposition
figure
on

soil
on

the
netherlands
said
it
had
strong
indications
that
iran
was
behind
the
assassinations
of
two
dutch
nationals
of
iranian
origin
in
and
in
the
latter
was
dissident
iranian

moghadam
and
a

sanctions
on
the
intelligence
ministry
which
is
under
the
control
of
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali

european
union
says
are
iran

destabilising
activities
in
europe
and
the
middle

the
deputy
minister

held
by
belgian
authorities
neither
appear
to
have
assets
in
france
which
first
imposed
the
asset
freeze
late
last
year
but
imposing
economic
sanctions
on
iran
once
the
eu
s
top
oil
supplier
remains
highly
sensitive
for
the
bloc
the
eu
has
been
straining
to
uphold
the
nuclear
accord
between
iran
and
world
powers
that
president
donald
trump
pulled
out
of
in
may
it
has
been
less
willing
to
consider
sanctions
instead
seeking
talks
with
tehran
iran
has
warned
it
could
ditch
the
nuclear
deal
if
eu
powers
do
not
protect
its
trade
and
financial
benefits
