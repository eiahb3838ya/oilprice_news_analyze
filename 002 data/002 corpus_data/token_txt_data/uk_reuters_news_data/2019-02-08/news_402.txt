any
assurances
britain
secures
from
the
european
union
on
the
irish
backstop
in
the
brexit
divorce
deal
will
be
completely
irrelevant
if
they
are
not
in
the
withdrawal
agreement
eurosceptic
lawmaker
jacob
said
on
monday
he
said
the
chance
of
britain
leaving
the
eu
without
a
deal
had
increased
after
prime
minister
theresa
may
delayed
a
vote
in
parliament
on
the
agreement
and
said
she
would
instead
go
back
to
the
eu
to
seek
further
reassurances
anything
that
is
not
physically
in
the
treaty
is
junior
law
so
if
the
prime
minister
comes
back
with
a
statement
warm
words
it
s
completely
irrelevant
because
the
treaty
outranks
it
told
reporters
unless
it
s
an
amendment
to
the
treaty
it
s
the
strongest
opposition
to
may
s
deal
centres
around
the
backstop
an
insurance
policy
designed
to
prevent
a
hard
border
between
eu
member
ireland
and
northern
ireland
echoed
the
northern
irish
democratic
unionist
party
dup
which
is
supposed
to
prop
up
may
s
government
but
is
committed
to
voting
against
her
deal
by
saying
the
backstop
had
to
be
removed
entirely
it
would
be
transformative
if
the
backstop
were
removed
but
this
is
the
whole
backstop
this
isn
t
some
paragraph
saying
it
will
finish
in
or
something
it
has
to
be
out
because
no
one
would
believe
the
date
