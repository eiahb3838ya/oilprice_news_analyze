london
reuters
the
uk
s
top
share
index
climbed
on
friday
as
cyclical
stocks
recovered
thanks
to
a
respite
from
trade
and
brexit
worries
while
results
from
mondi
and
rbs
were
the
ftse
index
rose
percent
to
points
though
it
suffered
its
first
weekly
loss
in
a
month
this
week
fresh
concerns
over
global
trade
marred
sentiment
after
president
donald
trump
ramped
up
the
pressure
on
china
by
proposing
a
higher
percent
tariff
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
trade
is
certainly
a
concern
among
other
concerns
around
the
world
it
s
not
one
a
global
investor
can
particularly
do
much
about
we
re
already
seeing
the
impact
in
a
number
of
companies
earnings
said
james
clarke
portfolio
manager
at
brandywine
global
certain
industries
are
hurt
more
than
others
he
said
but
a
lot
of
those
stocks
have
already
been
hit
is
that
an
opportunity
or
not
we
re
listening
very
carefully
to
this
quarter
s
conference
calls
to
see
what
is
actually
happening
in
these
businesses
said
clarke
while
the
bank
of
england
raised
interest
rates
as
expected
on
thursday
it
signalled
it
was
in
no
rush
to
raise
them
further
before
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
next
year
for
which
there
is
no
clear
plan
however
these
broader
worries
eased
briefly
as
traders
instead
focused
on
earnings
updates
from
paper
and
packaging
firm
mondi
and
lender
rbs
overall
analysts
say
the
earnings
season
in
the
uk
has
been
good
the
distraction
of
the
reporting
season
has
been
especially
welcome
in
the
uk
said
ian
williams
strategist
at
peel
hunt
after
a
very
difficult
start
to
the
year
it
now
looks
like
consensus
forecasts
have
been
pitched
at
a
sufficiently
conservative
level
to
allow
a
few
proper
upgrades
to
come
through
in
addition
to
those
that
simply
reflect
foreign
exchange
movements
he
wrote
in
a
note
shares
in
rbs
jumped
percent
and
touched
their
highest
level
since
the
end
of
june
after
the
bank
reported
results
not
only
was
attributable
profit
much
better
than
the
loss
expected
by
analysts
but
the
bank
announced
its
first
dividend
in
a
decade
rbs
continues
to
take
small
steps
rather
than
large
strides
but
even
so
is
demonstrating
something
of
a
return
to
health
richard
hunter
head
of
markets
at
interactive
investor
said
in
a
note
rbs
rise
helped
financials
add
the
most
points
to
the
ftse
while
materials
stocks
also
bounced
back
mondi
gained
percent
after
its
results
beat
expectations
however
shares
in
iag
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
index
down
percent
after
the
british
airways
owner
s
results
came
in
below
expectations
strikes
by
french
air
traffic
control
weighed
on
iag
s
second
quarter
operating
profit
results
were
also
in
focus
among
stocks
as
shares
in
william
hill
tumbled
percent
the
betting
company
posted
a
loss
and
warned
of
more
charges
as
it
revamps
its
retail
business
due
to
tougher
