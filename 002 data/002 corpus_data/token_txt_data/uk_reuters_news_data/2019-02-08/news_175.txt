in 5g play, vodafone and ibm link up cloud systems for business
frankfurt
reuters
vodafone
is
teaming
up
with
ibm
to
offer
businesses
a
way
to
link
different
cloud
computing
systems
to
support
the
next
wave
of
digital
advances
such
as
machine
learning
on
telecoms
networks
as
part
of
the
deal
the
telecoms
operator
will
pay
million
million
to
ibm
under
an
agreement
that
will
offer
tools
such
as
artificial
intelligence
ai
and
automation
to
networked
businesses
the
two
companies
are
pitching
the
venture
as
a
combination
of
cloud
computing
and
connectivity
that
would
for
example
enable
communication
between
robots
on
a
factory
floor
without
the
need
for
a
big
pipe
back
to
a
data
centre
and
with
an
estimated
percent
of
organisations
using
up
to
different
cloud
systems
the
ability
to
link
them
should
make
it
easier
for
firms
to
adapt
and
innovate
without
having
to
redesign
their
networks
from
the
ground
up
businesses
are
beginning
to
embrace
digital
as
they
do
that
they
get
a
lot
of
complexity
greg
hyttenrauch
of
vodafone
one
of
the
of
the
project
told
reuters
in
an
interview
we
predicated
this
venture
on
the
ability
to
simplify
that
vodafone
has
built
a
strong
position
in
mobile
services
for
business
it
is
the
no
or
no
provider
in
britain
germany
italy
and
spain
and
is
stepping
up
its
battle
against
bt
deutsche
telekom
telecom
italia
and
telefonica
in
the
business
market
it
aims
to
grow
business
service
revenue
which
currently
accounts
for
percent
of
its
total
by
combining
and
mobile
services
with
new
technology
in
areas
like
ai
and
the
internet
of
things
the
venture
will
focus
on
vodafone
s
british
german
and
irish
markets
targeting
multinationals
and
national
enterprises
operating
in
industries
such
as
retail
manufacturing
utilities
agriculture
or
transportation
it
is
expected
to
be
operational
in
the
first
half
of
the
partnership
seeks
to
bring
ibm
s
prowess
in
handling
multiple
systems
to
bear
and
reflects
the
priorities
behind
its
billion
takeover
of
red
hat
a
software
firm
that
specialises
in
linux
operating
systems
said
ibm
s
michael
valocchi
the
other
analyst
dave
bartoletti
at
forrester
research
said
the
deal
recognised
vodafone
s
need
for
a
partner
to
build
out
its
cloud
computing
services
at
the
same
time
ibm
is
moving
away
from
competing
head
on
with
hyperscale
cloud
providers
like
amazon
web
services
microsoft
azure
and
google
that
offer
hosted
memory
network
and
storage
services
that
can
grow
with
the
needs
of
big
businesses
instead
it
is
aiming
to
be
the
company
for
enterprises
who
need
to
stitch
together
multiple
cloud
platforms
said
bartoletti
analyst
carla
arend
at
idc
estimates
the
global
cloud
market
at
billion
this
year
with
the
market
for
global
cloud
connectivity
worth
another
billion
the
combined
global
market
opportunity
is
huge
she
said
ireland
and
britain
have
already
allocated
spectrum
and
germany
is
about
to
auction
frequencies
for
a
mobile
technology
that
will
offer
downloads
far
faster
than
on
existing
networks
as
well
as
latency
or
reaction
times
combining
these
characteristics
with
significant
computing
power
will
make
it
possible
to
deploy
applications
such
as
ai
or
computerised
problem
solving
in
the
field
telecoms
operators
say
they
expect
to
start
offering
services
from
next
year
in
european
markets
that
have
moved
to
allocate
spectrum
and
build
out
networks
