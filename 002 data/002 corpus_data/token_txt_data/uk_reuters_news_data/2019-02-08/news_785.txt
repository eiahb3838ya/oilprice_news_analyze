mexico
reuters
president
donald
trump
on
monday
vowed
to
begin
curtailing
millions
of
dollars
in
american
aid
to
three
central
american
nations
and
called
a
caravan
of
migrants
bound
for
the
united
states
a
national
emergency
as
he
sought
to
boost
his
party
s
chances
in
congressional
elections
guatemala
honduras
and
el
salvador
were
not
able
to
do
the
job
of
stopping
people
from
leaving
their
country
and
coming
illegally
to
the
we
will
now
begin
cutting
off
or
substantially
reducing
the
massive
foreign
aid
routinely
given
to
them
trump
wrote
in
a
series
of
twitter
posts
the
caravan
an
estimated
to
central
americans
fleeing
violence
and
poverty
in
their
homelands
is
in
southern
mexico
inching
towards
the
distant
border
trump
and
his
fellow
republicans
have
sought
to
make
the
caravan
and
immigration
campaign
issues
ahead
of
the
midterm
elections
in
which
his
party
is
fighting
to
maintain
control
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
remember
the
midterms
trump
tweeted
trump
s
remarks
also
seemed
aimed
at
piling
pressure
on
mexico
to
stop
the
caravan
something
that
he
complained
the
mexican
police
and
military
had
failed
to
do
mexico
which
has
refused
trump
s
demands
that
it
pay
for
a
border
wall
between
the
countries
tries
to
walk
a
fine
line
between
showing
solidarity
with
the
central
american
migrants
and
responding
to
washington
s
demands
to
control
its
borders
the
caravan
was
moving
north
again
on
monday
as
migrants
left
the
southern
mexican
city
of
tapachula
near
the
guatemalan
border
bound
for
the
town
of
huixtla
also
in
chiapas
state
some
shielded
themselves
from
the
midday
sun
with
umbrellas
others
with
bits
of
cardboard
on
which
they
had
slept
the
previous
night
as
they
left
the
city
and
crossed
a
highway
mexican
drivers
honked
their
horns
in
support
administrations
have
long
seen
aid
programs
as
an
essential
part
of
efforts
to
stabilise
the
countries
of
central
america
and
stem
the
flow
of
migrants
leaving
but
since
trump
became
president
last
year
the
united
states
has
already
moved
to
sharply
decrease
aid
to
the
region
in
the
united
states
provided
some
million
in
aid
to
guatemala
million
to
honduras
and
million
to
el
salvador
according
to
data
by
next
year
those
sums
were
projected
to
fall
to
million
for
guatemala
million
for
honduras
and
million
for
el
salvador
a
reduction
of
almost
percent
for
the
three
nations
later
on
monday
trump
headed
to
texas
a
key
border
state
to
campaign
for
republican
senator
ted
cruz
who
is
seeking
speaking
to
reporters
trump
stepped
up
his
criticism
saying
that
despite
getting
a
tremendous
amount
of
money
in
foreign
aid
guatemala
honduras
and
el
salvador
like
a
lot
of
others
do
nothing
for
our
trump
also
said
without
providing
evidence
that
criminals
and
unknown
middle
easterners
are
mixed
in
with
the
caravan
a
claim
immigration
advocates
disputed
democratic
representative
nita
lowey
said
trump
s
threat
to
cut
foreign
aid
ignores
that
congress
not
the
president
is
entrusted
by
the
constitution
with
the
power
of
the
lowey
said
congress
provides
assistance
to
central
american
countries
to
address
the
root
causes
of
why
people
want
to
leave
in
the
first
place
cutting
funding
would
make
the
problem
worse
not
better
lowey
added
in
a
statement
the
migrants
men
women
and
children
have
defied
threats
by
trump
that
he
will
close
the
border
as
well
as
mexican
government
warnings
argelia
ramirez
a
spokeswoman
for
the
caravan
said
there
were
about
people
in
the
group
and
that
around
of
them
would
seek
to
remain
in
mexico
spokesman
farhan
haq
estimated
the
caravan
includes
more
than
people
donald
trump
can
say
what
he
wants
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
knows
he
s
not
the
king
of
the
world
ramirez
told
reuters
we
re
fighting
for
a
cause
and
i
think
god
will
end
up
moving
the
hearts
of
all
the
american
the
caravan
is
still
a
long
way
more
than
miles
km
from
the
border
mexico
hopes
to
disperse
the
convoy
long
before
it
can
reach
the
border
using
bureaucratic
procedures
telling
migrants
to
register
with
authorities
in
order
to
submit
applications
for
asylum
in
mexico
that
process
can
last
weeks
and
migrants
are
supposed
to
stay
where
they
register
while
applications
are
processed
if
they
violate
those
rules
they
face
deportation
mexican
interior
minister
alfonso
navarrete
told
a
media
briefing

that
hondurans
had
sought
refugee
status
in
mexico

said
migrants
from
honduras
guatemala
and
el
salvador
had
been
returned
to
their
homelands

did
not
give
a
clear
answer
when
asked
if

would
accompany
the
migrants

stop
them
officers
had
instructions

keep
watch
over
the
caravan
and
help
the
national
migration
agency
navarrete
said
he
did
not
provide
further
details
of
how
the
police
would
be
deployed

mexican
president
enrique
pena
nieto
told
a
business
summit
that
those
in
the
caravan
who
did
not
follow
the
rules
were
unlikely
to
be
able
to
remain
in
mexico
or
reach
the
united
states
a

slashed
migration

over
the
past
few
years
a
feat
its
central
american
neighbours
had
not
matched
