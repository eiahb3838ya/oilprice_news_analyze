may must go now, says conservative mp baker
london
reuters
theresa
may
needs
to
be
replaced
as
british
prime
minister
now
a
leading
eurosceptic
lawmaker
in
her
conservative
party
said
on
tuesday
as
he
urged
colleagues
to
trigger
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
her
leadership
what
i
would
like
to
happen
today
is
for
conservative
members
of
parliament
to
realise
that
we
simply
can
not
go
staggering
forward
any
longer
like
this
and
i
m
afraid
to
put
their
letters
of
no
confidence
in
steve
baker
told
bbc
radio
may
on
monday
postponed
a
parliamentary
vote
on
her
brexit
withdrawal
deal
after
it
became
clear
it
would
be
defeated
to
seek
more
concessions
from
the
european
union
but
baker
said
her
policy
was
doomed
for
failure
if
we
can
t
go
forwards
with
her
deal
then
i
m
afraid
the
only
way
to
change
the
policy
is
to
change
the
prime
minister
and
i
really
think
it
her
duty
to
go
