investors
have
rewarded
italy
for
signs
that
it
might
curb
its
spending
ambitions
and
reach
a
deal
with
the
european
commission
over
its
budget
plans
european
central
bank
vice
president
luis
de
guindos
said
on
thursday
italy
has
been
locked
in
conflict
with
brussels
over
its
plans
to
spend
more
next
year
than
allowed
under
european
union
rules
raising
the
prospect
of
a
drawn
out
battle
and
sanctions
for
one
of
the
bloc
s
biggest
member
states
i
expect
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
italian
government
will
reach
an
agreement
with
the
european
commission
de
guindos
told
a
news
conference
adherence
and
full
respect
of
the
rules
is
something
that
is
he
added
that
signs
of
a
compromise
in
recent
days
had
already
pushed
down
borrowing
costs
and
there
was
now
a
clear
correlation
between
the
prospect
of
a
deal
and
italy
s
borrowing
costs
what
we
have
started
to
see
is
that
there
is
a
clear
parallel
evolution
between
the
perception
of
this
potential
agreement
with
the
commission
and
the
evolution
of
the
market
de
guindos
said
over
the
last
days
we
have
seen
that
these
organisations
could
potentially
arrive
at
an
agreement
and
immediately
the
spreads
started
to
come
down

minister
giovanni
tria
said
on
wednesday
that
italy
was
looking
for
ways
to
contain
public
spending
while
supporting
flagging
economic
growth
in
a
bid
to
head
off
eu
disciplinary
action
the
comments
came
less
than
two
days
after
the
government
signalled
it
may
be
willing
to
lower
its
deficit
spending
plans
italian
yields
are
about
basis
points
above
german
yields
down
from
above
basis
points
earlier
this
month
de
guindos
said
any
attempt
to
increase
spending
is
likely
to
punished
by
markets
and
the
gain
in
spending
will
be
offset
by
higher
borrowing
costs
