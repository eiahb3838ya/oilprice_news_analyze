australians eat 'parma' for drought-stricken farmers
sydney
reuters
thirsty
city
slickers
are
pitching
in
to
help
farmers
in
australia
s
parched
interior
by
eating
a
pub
delicacy
called
a
parma
with
some
of
the
proceeds
marked
for
drought
relief
the
dish
of
fried
crumbed
chicken
topped
with
tomato
sauce
and
melted
cheese
called
parmagiana
or
parma
for
short
is
staple
pub
food
across
a
country
in
the
depths
of
a
big
dry
winter
s
wheat
crop
is
failing
in
the
east
and
graziers
are
struggling
to
keep
livestock
alive
on
pastures
all
over
a
continent
where
the
bush
looms
large
in
the
public
psyche
that
s
prompted
bars
to
promise
a
dollar
in
donation
from
each
meal
sold
as
well
as
collecting
cash
from
barflies
as
part
of
the
parma
for
a
farmer
drive
we
thought
let
s
double
that
we
ll
do
two
dollars
james
martin
told
reuters
at
the
old
fitzroy
hotel
in
the
sydney
suburb
of
woolloomooloo
where
he
is
chef
it
resonates
for
me
to
jump
on
board
to
help
do
what
i
can
he
said
we
use
a
lot
of
produce
a
lot
of
meat
and
the
drought
issue
is
obviously
massive
for
the
farmers
but
there
is
this
huge
effect
that
s
occurring
throughout
a
thousand
other
pubs
have
signed
on
as
well
in
just
a
week
illustrating
the
depth
of
feeling
for
farmers
which
has
deepened
further
still
as
images
of
starving
sheep
dry
waterholes
and
fields
turned
to
moonscapes
have
hit
the
city
press
and
evening
bulletins
in
recent
weeks
we
ve
all
seen
the
horrendous
pictures
on
the
news
it
s
shocking
said
amanda
kinross
a
cake
decorator
from
rural
victorian
town
bendigo
who
began
the
campaign
with
a
facebook
post
within
minutes
pubs
were
saying
yep
we
re
australia
s
government
has
already
pledged
almost
a
million
million
in
aid
but
proceeds
from
the
parma
drive
will
be
directed
especially
to
assist
with
buying
and
sending
emergency
livestock
feed
to
affected
farms
sometimes
in
the
city
we
don
t
realise
how
tough
it
is
out
there
and
it
s
a
bit
of
a
tough
time
at
the
moment
so
supporting
in
any
way
that
we
can
said
andy
casey
who
tucked
in
to
a
huge
a
parma
with
chips
and
salad
for
lunch
it
was
fresh
it
was
delicious
