the

sudden
change
of

on
syria
is
surprising
and
risks
damaging
the
fight
against
islamic
state
german
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
said
on
thursday
after
the
united
states
decided
to
withdraw
from
syria
officials
said
on
thursday
the
united
states
would
end
its
air
campaign
against
islamic
state
in
syria
when
it
pulls
out
troops
sealing
an
abrupt
reversal
of
policy
which
has
alarmed
western
allies
as
well
as
washington
s
kurdish
battlefield
allies
is
has
been
pushed
back
but
the
threat
is
not
yet
over
there
is
a
danger
that
the
consequences
of
this
decision
will
damage
the
fight
against

and
jeopardise
the
successes
already
achieved

minister
ursula
von

said
the

was
a
cause
for
concern

good
solution
for
syria
during
negotiations
on

order
the
president
has
given
his
direction
but
the
speed
format
and
consequences
must
now
be
urgently
discussed
with
partners
i
assume
the
americans
won
t
withdraw
in
a
mad
rush
but
rather
be
aware
of
their
responsibility
not
only
towards
their
own
troops
but
also
towards
