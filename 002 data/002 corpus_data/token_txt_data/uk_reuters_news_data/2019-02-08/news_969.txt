fed raises u.s. interest rates, sees at least three more years of growth
washington
reuters
the
federal
reserve
raised
interest
rates
on
wednesday
and
left
intact
its
plans
to
steadily
tighten
monetary
policy
as
it
forecast
that
the
economy
would
enjoy
at
least
three
more
years
of
growth
in
a
statement
that
marked
the
end
of
the
era
of
accommodative
monetary
policy
fed
policymakers
lifted
the
benchmark
overnight
lending
rate
by
a
quarter
of
a
percentage
point
to
a
range
of
percent
to
percent
the
central
bank
still
foresees
another
rate
hike
in
december
three
more
next
year
and
one
increase
in
that
would
put
the
benchmark
overnight
lending
rate
at
percent
roughly
half
a
percentage
point
above
the
fed
s
estimated
neutral
rate
of
interest
at
which
rates
neither
stimulate
nor
restrict
the
economy
that
tight
policy
stance
is
projected
to
stay
level
through
the
timeframe
of
the
fed
s
latest
economic
projections
the
thing
that
folks
were
watching
for
which
they
went
ahead
and
did
was
remove
the
word
accommodative
in
regard
to
their
monetary
policy
said
michael
arone
chief
investment
strategist
at
state
street
global
advisors
it
does
seem
to
potentially
indicate
they
believe
monetary
policy
is
becoming
less
accommodative
and
getting
more
towards
that
neutral
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
said
the
removal
of
the
wording
which
had
been
a
staple
of
the
central
bank
s
guidance
for
financial
markets
and
households
for
much
of
the
past
decade
did
not
signal
a
policy
outlook
change
instead
it
is
a
sign
that
policy
is
proceeding
in
line
with
our
expectations
powell
who
took
over
as
head
of
the
fed
earlier
this
year
said
in
a
press
conference
after
the
release
of
the
statement
the
treasury
yield
curve
flattened
and
the
dollar
briefly
weakened
against
a
basket
of
currencies
stocks
initially
extended
gains
but
fell
later
in
the
trading
session
with
bank
and
financial
stocks
getting
hit
hard
the
fed
sees
the
economy
growing
at
a
percent
this
year
and
continuing
to
expand
moderately
for
at
least
three
more
years
amid
sustained
low
unemployment
and
stable
inflation
near
its
percent
target
the
labor
market
has
continued
to
strengthen
economic
activity
has
been
rising
at
a
strong
rate
it
said
in
its
statement
the
fed
inserted
no
substitute
language
for
the
dropped
accommodative
wording
in
its
statement
that
wording
had
become
less
and
less
accurate
since
the
central
bank
began
increasing
rates
in
late
from
a
level
and
its
removal
means
the
fed
now
considers
rates
near
neutral
wednesday
s
rate
increase
once
again
drew
criticism
from
president
donald
trump
who
has
complained
that
the
fed
s
actions
are
countering
his
efforts
to
boost
the
economy
we
re
doing
great
as
a
country
unfortunately
they
just
raised
interest
rates
because
we
are
doing
so
well
i
m
not
happy
about
that
trump
told
a
press
conference
on
the
sidelines
of
the
united
nations
general
assembly
in
new
york
i
d
rather
pay
down
debt
or
do
other
things
create
more
jobs
so
i
m
worried
about
the
fact
that
they
seem
to
like
raising
interest
powell
at
his
press
conference
declined
to
say
whether
fed
policymakers
had
discussed
trump
s
previous
criticism
of
the
central
bank
last
month
trump
expressed
his
displeasure
about
rising
rates
and
said
the
fed
should
do
more
to
boost
the
economy
powell
who
was
appointed
by
trump
and
took
over
as
fed
chairman
earlier
this
year
said
the
central
bank
would
remain
independent
we
don
t
consider
political
factors
or
things
like
that
the
fed
chief
said
wednesday
s
rate
hike
was
the
third
this
year
and
the
seventh
in
the
last
eight
quarters
ahead
of
wednesday
s
statement
traders
put
the
chance
of
a
rate
increase
at
percent
according
to

the

latest

show
the

a

pace
through

at

next
year
before
slowing
to
