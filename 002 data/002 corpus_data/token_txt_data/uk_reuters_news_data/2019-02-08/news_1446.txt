change
to
takeover
rules
in
almost
two
decades
giving
the
government
new
powers
to
block
deals
in
all
sectors
of
the

to

tighten
the
existing

which
are
limited
to
large
transactions
to
cover
all
british
companies
including
small
firms
the
changes
mark
a
new
era
of
government
oversight
of
business
activity
in
the
world
s
economy
which
has
traditionally
been
one
of
the
most
open
markets
to
global
mergers
and
acquisitions
it
comes
amid
a
boom
in
global
merger
and
acquisition
activity
in
which
britain
has
remained
the
second
most
popular
target
nation
for
deals
behind
the
united
states
about
billion
billion
of
offers
for
uk
firms
were
announced
in
the
first
six
months
of
the
year
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
the
changes
mirror
efforts
in
the
united
states
germany
france
and
australia
where
there
are
concerns
that
china
and
other
rivals
are
gaining
access
to
key
technologies
chinese
foreign
direct
investment
into
britain
reached
a
record
level
last
year
with
firms
acquiring
a
slew
of
energy
technology
and
property
assets
its
foreign
ministry
said
on
tuesday
china
hoped
britain
would
provide
a
fair
investment
environment
for
foreign
firms
britain
which
wants
to
reinvent
itself
as
a
global
trading
nation
after
deciding
to
leave
the
european
union
is
seeking
to
balance
the
demands
of
safeguarding
its
strategic
industries
while
continuing
to
court
foreign
investors
prime
minister
theresa
may
who
is
struggling
with
a
rebellion
in
her
party
over
her
brexit
plans
has
struck
a
more
cautious
tone
on
deals
since
becoming
prime
minister
in
these
proposals
will
ensure
we
have
the
appropriate
safeguards
to
protect
our
national
security
whilst
ensuring
our
economy
remains
unashamedly
and
open
to
high
levels
of
foreign
investment
in
the
future
clark
said
under
the
new
rules
the
government
will
have
the
power
to
intervene
when
a
company
wants
to
acquire
an
asset
such
as
a
particular
piece
of
technology
land
or
intellectual
property
rather
just
when
they
are
seeking
to
buy
or
take
control
of
a
firm
at
present
the
government
can
only
intervene
if
a
deal
creates
a
group
with
percent
of
the
market
or
with
turnover
of
over
million
pounds
that
has
already
been
reduced
to
million
pounds
for
companies
that
make
technology
with
military
or
applications
scrapping
the
revenue
and
market
threshold
targets
illustrates
the
perceived
threat
to
national
security
if
smaller
companies
with
advanced
technology
are
acquired
by
foreign
governments
for
the
first
time
breaches
of
the
government
s
recommendations
over
such
deals
will
also
be
classified
as
a
criminal
rather
than
a
civil
offence
deals
that
take
place
beyond
the
uk
s
borders
might
also
trigger
a
probe
the
types
of
transactions
that
could
be
reviewed
are
broad
said
samantha
mobley
of
law
firm
baker
mckenzie
somewhat
controversially
the
government
wants
the
ability
to
review
acquisitions
of
influence
or
control
over
assets
outside
of
the
uk
if
these
could
threaten
uk
national
the
department
for
business
energy
and
industrial
strategy
expects
to
review
around
deals
a
year
on
national
security
grounds
compared
to
one
so
far
this
year
and
one
last
year
last
year
the
government
approved
the
sale
of
sepura
which
makes
for
london
s
police
to
china
s
hytera
communications
after
a
probe
earlier
this
month
the
government
also
examined
the
impact
on
national
security
of
the
sale
of
northern
aerospace
to
gardner
aerospace
holdings
government
officials
say
the
changes
will
be
the
most
significant
to
takeover
rules
since
the
enterprise
act
which
allowed
a
merger
to
be
blocked
if
it
hurt
media
plurality
national
security
or
public
contracts
on
becoming
prime
minister
in
july
may
delayed
the
hinkley
point
nuclear
power
plant
project
which
is
being
built
by
french
utility
edf
and
by
china
she
ultimately
approved
the
deal
but
said
her
government
would
take
a
more
cautious
approach
over
similar
foreign
investments
in
the
future
a
government
report
last
week
found
that
technical
and
issues
with
equipment
made
by
chinese
firm
huawei
have
exposed
britain
s
telecom
networks
to
new
security
risks
the
rule
change
comes
as
britain
seeks
to
demonstrate
a
more
positive
approach
to
foreign
direct
investment
as
it
prepares
to
negotiate
trade
deals
after
leaving
the
european
union
under
president
donald
trump
the
committee
on
foreign
investment
in
the
united
states
which
assesses
potential
foreign
investment
to
ensure
it
does
not
harm
national
security
has
made
it
harder
for
chinese
firms
to
buy
assets
