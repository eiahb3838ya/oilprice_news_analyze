we

to
we
made
clear
to

that
and
they
agreed
it

time
for
us
to
begin
to
deliver
on
our
joint
commitments
pompeo
said
without

mentioning
the

the

backdrop
of
tense
ties
and
military
aid
cuts
over
islamabad
s
alleged
reluctance
to
crack
down
on
militants

has
accused

network
fighters
who
stage
attacks
in
afghanistan

denies
doing

for
pakistan
including
help

a
peace
process
in
neighbouring
afghanistan
our
bilateral
relationship
moving
forward
is
very
much
going

the
degree
of
cooperation
we
see
from
pakistan
in
doing
that
he
told
reporters
the
united
states
has
withheld
million
in
overall

it
incurs
expenses
in
fighting
militants
who
threaten
troops
in
afghanistan
pompeo

also
expected
to
discuss
pakistan
s
possible
plans
to
seek
a
bailout
from
the
international
monetary
fund
imf
to
ease
currency
pressures
and
avert
an
economic
crisis
in
july
pompeo
said
there
was
no
rationale
for
the
imf
to
give
money
to
pakistan
that
would
then
be
used
to
pay
off
chinese
loans
