turkey
will
not
allow
a
after
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
a
senior
member
of
president
tayyip
erdogan
s
ruling
ak
party
said
on
sunday
warning
that
consequences
could
be
dire
after
denying
any
involvement
in
the
disappearance
of
khashoggi
for
two
weeks
saudi
arabia
on
saturday
said
the
journalist
and
critic
of
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
had
died
in
a
fistfight
at
the
consulate
an
hour
later
another
saudi
official
attributed
the
death
to
a
chokehold
if
the
incident
transpired
as
it
has
been
told
across
the
world
there
is
no
way
saudi
officials
can
cover
this
up
by
saying
a
team
from
saudi
arabia
came
and
two
or
three
men
among
them
murdered
him
numan
kurtulmus
deputy
chairman
of
the
akp
told
cnn
turk
in
an
interview
a
crime
committed
in
a
consulate
can
not
be
carried
out
without
the
knowledge
of
the
senior
state
officials
of
that
country
if
this
crime
was
really
carried
out
as
has
been
said
if
the
evidence
really
leads
to
that
conclusion
the
situation
will
be
dire
and
this
must
have
very
serious
legal
reflecting
the
intensifying
international
scepticism
over
its
account
a
senior
saudi
government
official
has
laid
out
a
new
version
that
in
key
respects
contradicts
previous
explanations
the
latest
account
includes
details
on
how
the
team
of
saudi
nationals
sent
to
confront
khashoggi
had
threatened
him
with
being
drugged
and
kidnapped
and
then
killed
him
in
a
chokehold
when
he
resisted
a
member
of
the
team
then
dressed
in
khashoggi
s
clothes
to
make
it
appear
as
if
he
had
left
the
consulate
