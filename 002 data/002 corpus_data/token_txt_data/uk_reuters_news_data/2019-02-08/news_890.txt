washington
reuters
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
sought
to
put
a
bruising
confirmation
battle
behind
him
on
monday
at
a
white
house
ceremony
in
which
president
donald
trump
declared
him
innocent
of
sexual
misconduct
and
apologised
for
the
heated
process
kavanaugh
whose
bid
to
join
the
top
court
nearly
failed
after
a
california
professor
accused
him
of
assaulting
her
when
they
were
in
high
school
said
he
would
enter
his
new
job
without
bitterness
despite
a
political
fight
that
he
told
lawmakers
had
destroyed
his
family
and
his
name
the
senate
confirmation
process
was
contentious
and
emotional
that
process
is
over
my
focus
now
is
to
be
the
best
justice
i
can
be
he
said
at
the
white
house
with
his
wife
and
children
standing
nearby
kavanaugh
said
he
would
aim
to
be
a
force
for
stability
and
unity
on
the
court
whose
other
eight
members
all
attended
the
ceremony
although
the
senate
confirmation
process
tested
me
as
it
has
tested
others
it
did
not
change
me
he
said
kavanaugh
who
served
as
part
of
special
counsel
kenneth
starr
s
team
that
investigated
democratic
president
bill
clinton
in
the
and
testified
that
the
sexual
misconduct
accusations
were
funded
by
groups
seeking
revenge
on
behalf
of
the
clintons
said
the
supreme
court
was
not
a
partisan
body
the
supreme
court
is
an
institution
of
law
it
is
not
a
partisan
or
political
institution
he
said
the
supreme
court
is
a
team
of
nine
and
i
will
always
be
a
team
player
on
the
team
of
kavanaugh
s
confirmation
proceedings
exploded
in
controversy
after
christine
blasey
ford
went
public
with
allegations
that
kavanaugh
sexually
assaulted
her
in
kavanaugh
gave
a
forceful
emotional
denial
of
those
allegations
during
testimony
before
lawmakers
that
some
democrats
said
showed
a
lack
of
judicial
temperament
the
senate
voted
on
saturday
to
confirm
him
with
just
one
democrat
supporting
him
his
confirmation
to
the
lifetime
job
was
a
victory
for
trump
and
locked
in
a
conservative
majority
on
the
court
on
behalf
of
our
nation
i
want
to
apologise
to
brett
and
the
entire
kavanaugh
family
for
the
terrible
pain
and
suffering
you
have
been
forced
to
endure
trump
said
at
the
start
of
a
ceremonial
those
who
step
forward
to
serve
our
country
deserve
a
fair
and
dignified
evaluation
not
a
campaign
of
political
and
personal
destruction
based
on
lies
and
deception
he
said
trump
under
pressure
from
moderate
republican
senators
had
ordered
a
brief
fbi
investigation
whose
results
republicans
viewed
as
failing
to
corroborate
the
allegations
and
which
democrats
saw
as
insufficient
trump
who
drew
criticism
for
mocking
ford
at
a
rally
said
kavanaugh
had
been
cleared
a
man
or
a
woman
must
always
be
presumed
innocent
unless
and
until
proven
guilty
trump
said
to
applause
and
with
that
i
must
state
that
you
sir
under
historic
scrutiny
were
proven
kavanaugh
has
cited
his
mother
a
former
state
judge
in
maryland
as
an
inspiration
and
emphasized
his
commitment
to
the
advancement
of
women
