in
a
nod
to
his
battlefield
gains
israel
described
victory
by
assad
who
is
on
a
last
push
to
restore
his
rule
after
more
than
seven
years
of
civil
war
as
a
fait
accompli
that
could
calm
the
golan
heights
the
strategic
plateau
divides
israel
and
syria
old
foes
and
saw
decades
of
stable
before
the
syrian
rebellion
meanwhile
in
a
major
change
to
the
status
quo
russian
military
police
began
deploying
on
the
golan
and
planned
to
set
up
eight
observation
posts
in
the
area
the
defence
ministry
in
moscow
said
after
weeks
of
intensive
bombing
syrian
forces
have
seized
the
lush
farmland
where
the
yarmouk
river
flows
that
was
once
controlled
by
a
group
affiliated
to
islamic
state
known
as
the
khaled
bin
walid
army
the
israeli
military
said
it
carried
out
an
air
strike
on
the
golan
on
wednesday
night
killing
seven
insurgents
it
believed
were
from
the
khaled
bin
walid
army
and
en
route
to
attack
an
israeli
target
separately
the
jordan
military
said
it
had
clashed
with
encroaching
khaled
bin
walid
army
fighters
for
hours
between
tuesday
and
wednesday
killing
an
unspecified
number
of
them
we
applied
rules
of
engagement
and
members
of
the
daesh
islamic
state
gang
were
forced
to
retreat
inside
syria
an
army
source
told
jordanian
state
news
agency
petra
assad
s
sweep
of
southwest
syria
drove
hundreds
of
thousands
of
refugees
toward
israel
and
jordan
alarming
both
as
tensions
peaked
last
week
israel
shot
down
a
syrian
warplane
that
it
said
had
strayed
into
the
golan
and
warned
assad
s
iranian
and
lebanese
hezbollah
reinforcements
against
trying
to
deploy
on
the
side
but
israeli
defence
minister
avigdor
lieberman
sounded
more
upbeat
on
thursday
as
he
described
an
assad
win
as
a
given
from
our
perspective
the
situation
is
returning
to
how
it
was
before
the
civil
war
meaning
there
is
a
real
address
someone
responsible
and
central
rule
lieberman
told
reporters
during
a
tour
of
air
defence
units
in
northern
israel
asked
whether
israel
should
be
less
wary
of
possible
on
the
golan
much
of
which
it
seized
from
syria
in
a
war
and
annexed
in
a
move
not
recognised
abroad
lieberman
said
i
believe
so
i
think
this
is
also
in
assad
s
there
was
no
immediate
syrian
government
response
to
the
border
clashes
reported
by
jordan
and
syria
on
thursday
the
syrian
observatory
for
human
rights
a
war
monitoring
group
confirmed
fighting
between
assad
s
forces
and
islamic
state
on
the
golan
which
also
abuts
jordan
in
moscow
the
russian
defence
ministry
said
its
deployment
of
military
police
on
the
golan
was
aimed
at
supporting
a
peacekeeper
presence
it
said
the
new
russian
posts
would
be
handed
over
to
the
syrian
government
once
the
situation
had
stabilised
lieberman
said
that
for
there
to
be
quiet
between
israel
and
syria
assad
must
abide
by
a
armistice
that
set
up
demilitarized
zones
on
the
golan
lieberman
reiterated
israel
s
demand
that
iran
not
set
up
military
bases
against
it
in
syria
nor
that
syria
be
used
to
smuggle
arms
to
hezbollah
guerrillas
in
neighbouring
lebanon
