with

jeeps
stationed
at
key
access
routes
and
tourists
undergoing
metal
detector
and

a
member
of
islamic
state
and
who
had
threatened
to
bomb
churches
in
italy
including
peter
s
in
his
address
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
reference
to
the
shrill
political
climate
in
a
number
of
countries
francis
called
for
fraternity
among
people
with
different
ideas
yet
capable
of
respecting
and
listening
to
one
another
francis
the
first
pope
from
latin
america
alluded
to
polarisation
over
migration
saying
god
wanted
love
acceptance
respect
for
this
poor
humanity
of
ours
which
we
all
share
in
a
great
variety
of
races
languages
and
cultures
our
differences
then
are
not
a
detriment
or
a
danger
they
are
a
source
of
richness
he
said
francis
called
for
the
resumption
of
dialogue
between
israelis
and
palestinians
to
undertake
a
journey
of
peace
that
can
put
an
end

a
conflict

for
over
years
has
lacerated
the
land
chosen
by
the
lord
to
show
his
face
of
love

urged
the
international
community
to
work

a
political
solution

truce
brokered
in
yemen

civil
war
could
bring
relief
to
a
population
exhausted
by
violence
and
famine
the
pope
also
called
for
social
harmony
in
nicaragua
and
venezuela
both
racked
by
internal
political
conflicts
the
millions
of
refugees
or
displaced
people
in
africa
who
are
in
need
of
humanitarian
assistance
and
food
security
should
not
be
forgotten
he
said
in
ukraine
he
called
for
a
peace
respectful
of
the
rights
of
every
nation
ukraine
s
relations
with

a
downwards
spiral

separatists
in
eastern
