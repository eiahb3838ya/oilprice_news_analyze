labour calls on may to try a brexit compromise to get deal passed
london
reuters
prime
minister
theresa
may
could
eventually
get
a
brexit
deal
through
parliament
if
she
negotiated
a
compromise
with
the
opposition
labour
party
the
second
most
powerful
man
in
the
party
told
reuters
on
wednesday
may
s
brexit
deal
suffered
a
crushing
defeat
in
parliament
on
tuesday
triggering
political
chaos
that
could
lead
to
a
disorderly
exit
from
the
eu
a
reversal
of
the
decision
to
leave
or
a
compromise
deal
of
some
sort
the
labour
party
s
finance
policy
chief
john
mcdonnell
said
labour
would
support
may
if
she
agreed
to
stay
in
a
permanent
customs
union
with
the
eu
a
close
relationship
with
its
single
market
and
greater
protections
for
workers
and
consumers
we
will
support
a
deal
that
brings
the
country
back
together
protects
jobs
and
supports
the
economy
mcdonnell
said
we
have
had
that
open
door
policy
all
the
way
through
for
two
years
she
has
not
contacted
not
approached
us
not
reached
with
the
ruling
conservative
party
divided
the
opposition
party
holds
great
influence
over
the
eventual
outcome
of
brexit
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
any
brexit
plan
can
pass
the
house
of
commons
without
the
support
of
some
of
labour
s
lawmakers
in
an
indication
of
the
scale
of
the
political
crisis
gripping
britain
may
has
indicated
she
is
ready
to
reach
out
to
opposition
lawmakers
in
talks
to
find
an
amicable
divorce
deal
to
leave
the
eu
but
labour
like
much
of
britain
is
deeply
split
over
brexit
with
many
younger
supporters
in
urban
areas
enthusiastic
supporters
of
the
eu
while
many
supporters
in
the
party
s
traditional
heartlands
back
leaving
the
bloc
the
party
is
formally
committed
to
carrying
out
brexit
but
says
all
options
including
a
new
referendum
would
be
on
the
table
if
may
fails
to
secure
parliamentary
support
for
a
deal
and
can
not
be
removed
from
power
a
group
of
labour
lawmakers
on
wednesday
urged
their
leader
jeremy
corbyn
to
swing
behind
a
second
referendum
on
remaining
part
of
the
european
union
corbyn
a
veteran
eurosceptic
who
in
voted
no
to
britain
s
membership
of
the
community
is
far
more
wary
of
a
calling
a
second
referendum
than
many
of
his
centrist
labour
colleagues
mcdonnell
who
describes
karl
marx
as
one
of
his
main
influences
said
there
was
no
majority
in
parliament
for
leaving
the
eu
without
a
deal
so
the
two
most
likely
options
are
a
compromise
deal
or
a
national
election
it
is
a
bizarre
situation
but
here
i
am
the
shadow
chancellor
going
on
the
news
to
steady
the
markets
because
the
tories
and
the
existing
chancellor
can
t
do
it
he
said
the
reason
that
i
am
trying
to
do
that
is
because
there
are
an
overwhelming
majority
in
parliament
against
a
no
deal
we
will
use
every
parliamentary
mechanism
to
prevent
a
no
mcdonnell
said
he
still
prefers
a
snap
election
to
win
for
labour
its
own
mandate
for
an
eu
exit
based
around
a
permanent
customs
union
with
the
eu
rather
than
holding
a
new
brexit
referendum
our
view
is
that
we
have
should
have
a
general
election
while
having
a
debate
on
brexit
amongst
all
the
other
issues
as
well
a
much
wider
debate
but
you
can
also
choose
the
team
that
will
then
do
the
negotiation
he
said
mcdonnell
said
it
is
increasingly
likely
that
the
government
will
have
to
ask
for
a
extension
to
the
formal
process
of
leaving
the
eu
which
is
known
as
article
the
next
fortnight
will
be
critical
he
said
the
more
time
it
takes
up
over
the
next
couple
of
weeks
the
more
likely
the
government
is
to
have
to
ask
for
an
