president
donald
trump
s
administration
is
considering
giving
troops
on
the
border
with
mexico
the
authority
to
carry
out
medical
screening
of
migrants
officials
told
reuters
on
tuesday
the
proposal
which
is
still
in
draft
form
and
circulating
within
the
administration
would
involve
the
military
in
screenings
for
things
like
illness
and
injury
only
if
customs
and
border
protection
cbp
agency
personnel
were
overwhelmed
and
unable
to
do
so
on
their
own
the
officials
said
the
proposal
would
expand
the
mission
for
the
pentagon
which
said
previously
it
did
not
expect
its
forces
to
directly
interact
with
migrants
the
pentagon
declined
to
comment
on
internal
deliberations
in
a
statement
it
said
the
operation
would
cost
about
million
million
pounds
through
based
on
current
plans
military
duties
on
the
border
including
stringing
up
concertina
wire
and
building
temporary
housing
have
been
aimed
at
supporting
cbp
personnel
the
officials
who
spoke
to
reuters
about
the
proposal
did
so
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
trump
has
not
yet
signed
off
on
the
idea
it
was
unclear
if
the
proposal
if
confirmed
in
the
coming
days
might
prolong
the
deployment
of
at
least
some
troops
at
the
border
the
commander
of
the
mission
told
reuters
last
week
that
the
number
of
troops
may
have
peaked
at
around
and
he
would
soon
look
at
whether
to
begin
sending
forces
home
or
shifting
some
to
new
border
positions
trump
who
won
the
presidency
in
after
a
campaign
promising
to
crack
down
on
illegal
immigration
has
seized
upon
migrant
caravans
headed
towards
the
border
comparing
it
to
an
critics
have
derided
his
position
as
a
stunt
that
politicizes
the
military
about
central
americans
have
reached
the
mexican
border
cities
of
tijuana
and
mexicali
according
to
local
officials
more
bands
of
migrants
are
making
their
way
towards
tijuana
with
around
expected
in
tijuana
and
other
ports
of

are
trained
to
check
migrants

obvious
signs
of
infectious
conditions
like
fever
bleeding
from
the
eyes
or
other
symptoms
of
quarantinable
and
communicable
diseases
according
to
a
report
by
the
congressional
research
service
one
official
said
that
under
the
latest
proposal
troops
would
carry
out
medical
screenings
only
if
other
officials
such
as
from
state
and
local
governments
or
the
national
guard
were
not
available
or
overwhelmed
the
intent
of
the
authorities
is
not
to
bring
the
troops
in
closer
contact
with
the
migrants
but
to
provide
medical
assistance
if
needed

border
with
mexico
if
they
come
under
threat
from
