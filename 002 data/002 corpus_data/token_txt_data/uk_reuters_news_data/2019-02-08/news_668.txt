in china, female pilots strain to hold up half the sky
shanghai
reuters
when
han
siyuan
first
decided
to
apply
for
a
job
as
a
pilot
cadet
in
she
was
up
against
female
classmates
in
china
on
tests
measuring
everything
from
their
command
of
english
to
the
length
of
their
legs
eventually
she
became
the
only
woman
from
her
university
that
spring
airlines
picked
for
training
that
year
she
is
now
a
captain
for
the
chinese
budget
carrier
but
it
has
not
become
much
easier
for
the
women
who
have
come
after
her
han
is
one
of
just
women
in
china
who
at
the
end
of
held
a
license
to
fly
civilian
aircraft
compared
with
men
of
spring
airlines
pilots
only
six
are
women
i
ve
gotten
used
to
living
in
a
man
s
world
she
said
china
s
proportion
of
female
pilots
at
percent
is
one
of
the
world
s
lowest
which
analysts
and
pilots
attribute
to
social
perceptions
and
hiring
practices
by
chinese
airlines
but
chinese
airlines
are
struggling
with
an
acute
pilot
shortage
amid
surging
travel
demand
and
female
pilots
are
drawing
attention
to
the
gender
imbalance
chinese
carriers
will
need
new
pilots
over
the
next
two
decades
according
to
forecasts
by
planemaker
boeing
co
and
the
shortfall
has
so
far
prompted
airlines
to
aggressively
hire
foreign
captains
and
chinese
regulators
to
relax
physical
entry
requirements
for
cadets
the
mission
is
to
start
cutting
down
the
thorns
that
cover
this
road
to
make
it
easier
for
those
who
come
after
us
said
chen
jingxian
a
lawyer
who
learned
to
fly
in
the
united
states
and
is
among
those
urging
change
such
issues
are
not
confined
to
china
the
proportion
of
female
pilots
in
south
korea
and
japan
where
such
jobs
do
not
conform
to
widespread
gender
stereotypes
is
also
less
than
percent
but
it
is
a
sharp
contrast
to
the
situation
in
india
which
like
china
has
a
aviation
market
but
thanks
to
aggressive
recruiting
and
support
such
as
day
care
india
has
the
world
s
highest
proportion
of
female
commercial
pilots
at
percent
china
s
airlines
only
hire
cadets
directly
from
universities
or
the
military
they
often
limit
recruitment
drives
to
male
applicants
and
very
rarely
take
in
female
cohorts
in
addition
unlike
in
other
markets
such
as
the
united
states
china
does
not
allow
people
to
convert
private
flying
licenses
to
commercial
certificates
for
flying
airliners
li
haipeng
deputy
director
of
the
civil
aviation
management
institute
of
china
s
general
aviation
department
said
many
airlines
were
also
dissuaded
to
hire
women
by
generous
maternity
leave
policies
that
has
been
further
aggravated
by
beijing
s
move
in
to
change
the
policy
he
added
male
pilots
do
not
have
the
issue
of
not
being
able
to
fly
for
two
years
after
giving
birth
and
after
the
introduction
of
the
policy
airlines
are
not
willing
to
recruit
and
train
a
pilot
only
to
have
her
not
being
able
to
fly
for
about
five
years
he
said
he
said
air
china
china
eastern
airlines
and
china
southern
airlines
had
all
made
some
effort
to
recruit
female
pilots
adding
nearly
all
other
companies
do
china
eastern
and
china
southern
declined
to
comment
while
air
china
did
not
respond
to
reuters
requests
for
comment
pilots
said
that
hiring
decisions
were
usually
left
to
individual
airlines
and
did
not
appear
to
be
driven
by
the
country
s
regulator
the
civil
aviation
administration
of
china
whose
recruitment
requirements
do
not
mention
gender
xiamen
airlines
a
china
southern
subsidiary
told
reuters
it
offers
up
to
days
of
maternity
leave
it
started
recruiting
female
pilots
in
and
paused
for
a
few
years
in
between
before
resuming
last
year
out
of
its
pilots
are
women
while
another
are
in
training
allowing
more
women
to
become
pilots
is
undoubtedly
a
good
way
to
supplement
an
airline
s
flying
capability
a
spokesman
for
the
carrier
said
the
strongest
calls
for
change
are
coming
mostly
from
chinese
female
pilots
thanks
to
a
slew
of
returnees
who
learned
how
to
fly
while
living
abroad
in
countries
like
the
united
states
in
march
the
china
airline
pilots
association
chalpa
established
a
female
branch
at
an
event
attended
by
pilots
from
the
people
s
liberation
army
air
force
and
local
airlines
according
to
media
reports
chen
the
lawyer
who
also
serves
as
a
of
the
chalpa
s
women
s
branch
said
she
and
others
have
been
trying
to
spread
the
word
by
speaking
about
the
issue
at
air
shows
in
china
eventually
she
said
the
organisation
hopes
to
persuade
chinese
airlines
to
adjust
their
recruitment
and
maternity
policies
another
key
obstacle
to
tackle
she
added
was
the
inability
of
general
aviation
pilots
to
shift
to
the
commercial
sector
it
s
a
systemic
issue
she
said
we
hope
that
change
can
happen
in
three
to
five
years
but
this
is
not
something
that
is
up
to
others
like
han
who
in
recent
months
has
appeared
in
spring
airlines
promotional
videos
said
she
hoped
the
growing
publicity
would
help
to
raise
awareness
i
can
t
personally
give
people
opportunities
she
said
but
i
hope
that
the
publicity
can
slowly
help
open
the
door
for
companies
or
for
girls
with
dreams

reporting
