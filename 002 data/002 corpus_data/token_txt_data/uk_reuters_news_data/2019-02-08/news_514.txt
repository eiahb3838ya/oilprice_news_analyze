reuters
the
united
arab
emirates
on
monday
pardoned
and
released
a
british
academic
jailed
for
life
on
spying
charges
granting
a
request
for
clemency
after
showing
a
video
of
him
purportedly
confessing
to
membership
of
the
uk
s
intelligence
service
the
case
has
strained
ties
between
the
allies
leading
london
to
issue
a
forceful
diplomatic
response
after
last
week
s
verdict
was
handed
down
with
a
warning
that
it
could
hurt
relations
the
uae
president
issued
the
pardon
as
part
of
a
mass
clemency
of
more
than
prisoners
to
mark
the
country
s
national
day
according
to
a
statement
on
state
news
agency
wam
the
pardon
was
effective
immediately
and
matthew
hedges
a
doctoral
student
at
durham
university
held
for
more
than
six
months
will
be
allowed
to
leave
the
country
once
formalities
are
completed
the
statement
said
a
uae
official
later
said
hedges
lad
been
freed
britain
s
foreign
secretary
jeremy
hunt
welcomed
the
move
which
he
called
fantastic
news
although
we
didn
t
agree
with
charges
we
are
grateful
to
uae
government
for
resolving
issue
hunt
said
it
was
also
a
bittersweet
moment
because
he
was
thinking
about
innocent
people
still
detained
in
iran
the
of
abu
dhabi
justice
won
t
be
truly
done
until
they
too
are
safely
home
he
said
hedge
s
wife
daniela
tejada
said
his
family
was
elated
over
the
news
the
uae
had
signalled
on
friday
that
it
was
working
on
an
amicable
solution
to
the
case
after
prime
minister
theresa
may
had
described
last
week
s
sentence
as
deeply
disappointing
hedges
has
been
held
since
may
when
he
was
arrested
at
dubai
international
airport
after
a
research
visit
tejada
has
said
he
was
kept
in
solitary
confinement
for
more
than
five
months
and
the
evidence
presented
against
him
consisted
of
notes
from
his
dissertation
research
last
week
s
hearing
lasted
less
than
five
minutes
she
said
the
uae
s
ambassador
to
the
uk
has
disputed
the
account
saying
the
case
was
extremely
serious
and
there
had
not
been
a
five
minute
show
minutes
before
the
pardon
was
announced
a
uae
government
spokesman
showed
journalists
a
video
of
hedges
purporting
to
confess
to
belonging
to
britain
s
secret
intelligence
service
and
researching
which
military
systems
the
uae
was
buying
in
the
video
which
was
sometimes
inaudible
and
shown
with
subtitles
that
could
not
be
independently
verified
hedges
appeared
to
say
he
approached
sources
as
a
doctoral
student
the
spokesman
jaber
said
hedges
was
percent
a
secret
service
operative
and
aimed
to
steal
the
uae
s
sensitive
national
secrets
for
his
paymasters
but
did
not
take
questions
on
the
case
he
said
hedges
aimed
to
gather
information
on
government
figures
including
members
of
the
uae
s
ruling
families
and
their
networks
and
economic
data
related
to
strategic
firms
hedges
had
built
an
extensive
network
of
contacts
while
working
with
dubai
s
institute
for
near
east
gulf
military
analysis
inegma
then
returned
to
the
uae
on
assignment
as
an
undercover
student
on
research
trip
lamki
said
hedges
family
and
colleagues
have
cast
him
as
a
talented
researcher
who
fell
foul
of
the
uae
security
and
justice
system
his
dissertation
research
focussed
on
security
structures
tribalism
and
the
consolidation
of
political
power
in
abu
dhabi
which
are
considered
sensitive
topics
in
the
uae
they
said
like
most
gulf
states
the
uae
brooks
little
public
criticism
of
ruling
family
members
senior
officials
or
policy
and
has
prosecuted
activists
for
what
it
calls
insulting
the
country
s
leaders
after
the
pardon
his
family
thanked
british
authorities
and
others
who
had
offered
their
support
in
urging
uae
authorities
to
release
hedges
the
presidential
pardon
for
matt
is
the
best
news
we
could
have
received
our
months
of
nightmare
are
finally
over
