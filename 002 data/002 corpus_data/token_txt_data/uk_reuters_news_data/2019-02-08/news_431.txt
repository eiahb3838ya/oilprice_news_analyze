about
rohingya

and
called
for
action
against
him
senior

at
the

ministry
said
rohingya
muslims
living
as

in
bangladesh
after
escaping

are
being
brainwashed
into
marching
on
the

s
religion
minister
thura
aung
ko
said
in
a
video
released
by
the

we
strongly
protest
their
minister
s
provocative
remarks
it
also
hurt
muslim
sentiments
a
senior
official
in
the
bangladesh
foreign
ministry
told
reuters
on
thursday
condemning
the
comments
about
marching
on
myanmar
he
said
we
have
zero
tolerance
towards
militancy
we
have
never
encouraged
if
you
give
them
citizenship
and
their
property
back
they
will
run
for
myanmar
instead
of
doing
that
you
are
making
provocative
statements
this
is
unfortunate
the

said
more
than
rohingya
fled
myanmar
s
rakhine
state
in
the
wake
of
a
brutal
army
crackdown
last
august

say
and
are
now
living
in
crowded
bangladeshi
refugee
camps
investigators
have
accused
myanmar
soldiers
of
carrying
out
mass
killings
rapes

burning
hundreds
of
villages
with
genocidal
intent
myanmar
denies
most
of
the
allegations
when
bangladesh
summoned
myanmar
ambassador
u
lwin
oo
he
tried
to
dilute
the
comments
by
saying
they
were
the
religion
minister
s
personal
opinion
said
an
official
at
the
bangladesh
foreign
ministry
who
was
present
at
the
meeting
but
we
asked
for
action
against
the
the
religion
minister
s
comments
come
as
both
countries
have
been
engaged
in
negotiations
for
more
than
a
year
to
repatriate
the
rohingya
to
myanmar
often
blaming
each
other
for
delays
in
the
process
the
latest
plan
was
scuppered
last
month
after
no
refugees
agreed
to
return
saying
they
wouldn
t
go
back
unless
myanmar
met
a
series
of
demands
chiefly
granting
them
citizenship
rights
