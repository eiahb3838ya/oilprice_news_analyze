farnborough
england
reuters
executives
from
top
aerospace
and
aviation
companies
called
on
thursday
for
efforts
to
attract
more
women
saying
this
could
help
solve
looming
shortages
of
pilots
mechanics
and
top
managers
in
the
traditionally
sector
the
industries
are
coming
under
scrutiny
because
of
the
low
numbers
of
women
employed
as
senior
executives
or
airline
pilots
at
the
same
time
a
growing
shortage
of
pilots
is
putting
the
sector
s
recent
growth
at
risk
the
head
of
qatar
airways
akbar
al
baker
caused
a
storm
last
month
when
he
said
that
a
woman
could
not
do
his
job
although
he
later
apologised
saying
his
comments
had
been
intended
as
a
joke
and
were
taken
out
of
context
charlotte
pedersen
chief
executive
of
luxaviation
helicopters
a
private
aviation
operator
said
urgent
action
was
needed
since
the
sector
faced
a
potential
huge
gap
in
management
capacity
in
a
decade
as
current
executives
retired
we
can
t
just
recruit
from
half
the
population
pedersen
the
first
female
pilot
in
the
danish
air
force
told
a
panel
discussion
at
the
farnborough
airshow
marnie
munn
an
airline
captain
with
easyjet
told
the
conference
that
only
three
to
four
percent
of
pilots
globally
were
women
jane
basson
chief
of
staff
to
airbus
ceo
tom
enders
said
women
now
accounted
for
percent
of
the
company
s
workforce
of
but
that
was
just
a
tick
up
from
percent
in
it
s
not
progressing
fast
enough
she
said
adding
that
her
company
was
now
using
data
analysis
tools
to
understand
why
it
was
proving
so
difficult
to
recruit
and
retain
women
in
addition
she
said
airbus
was
using
tools
such
as
smart
phone
applications
to
provide
encouragement
and
support
to
workers
but
could
tailor
those
to
reach
women
specifically
hundreds
of
industry
executives
attended
the
panel
with
many
signing
a
uk
charter
that
commits
organisations
to
support
promotion
of
women
to
senior
roles
set
their
own
targets
and
report
on
their
progress
to
boost
accountability
more
than
aviation
and
aerospace
companies
with
operations
in
britain
have
signed
the
charter
and
the
number
is
growing
said
katherine
bennett
a
senior
vice
president
with
airbus
it
is
modelled
on
a
similar
pledge
in
the
finance
sector
signatories
also
agree
to
have
a
senior
executive
oversee
diversity
efforts
and
to
link
pay
of
senior
executives
to
meeting
internal
targets
on
gender
diversity
and
inclusion
budget
airline
easyjet
has
a
target
that
percent
of
its
new
pilots
should
be
female
by
and
british
aviation
minister
liz
sugg
said
other
firms
were
taking
similar
steps
but
more
work
was
needed
to
close
pay
gaps
that
often
exceeded
percent
in
the
aerospace
sector
add
women
to
corporate
boards
and
recruit
more
female
pilots
she
said
noting
that
women
make
up
just
percent
of
pilots
at
airlines
we
really
do
have
a
long
way
to
go
before
these
barriers
disappear
altogether
there
are
fundamental
gender
issues
in
aviation
and
aerospace
