exclusive: u.s. commanders recommend letting kurdish fighters in syria keep weapons
washington
reuters
commanders
planning
for
the
withdrawal
of
troops
from
syria
are
recommending
that
kurdish
fighters
battling
islamic
state
be
allowed
to
keep
weapons
four
officials
said
a
move
that
would
likely
anger
nato
ally
turkey
three
of
the
officials
speaking
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
said
the
recommendations
were
part
of
discussions
on
a
draft
plan
by
the
military
it
is
unclear
what
the
pentagon
will
ultimately
recommend
to
the
white
house
discussions
are
still
at
an
early
stage
inside
the
pentagon
and
no
decision
has
yet
been
made
the
officials
said
the
plan
will
then
be
presented
to
the
white
house
in
the
coming
days
with
president
donald
trump
making
the
final
decision
the
pentagon
said
it
would
be
inappropriate
and
premature
to
comment
on
what
will
happen
with
the
weapons
planning
is
ongoing
and
focused
on
executing
a
deliberate
and
controlled
withdrawal
of
forces
while
taking
all
measures
possible
to
ensure
our
troops
safety
said
commander
sean
robertson
a
pentagon
white
house
did
not
comment
trump
last
week
abruptly
ordered
a
complete
withdrawal
of
troops
from
syria
drawing
widespread
criticism
and
prompting
defence
secretary
jim
mattis
resignation
the
officials
said
trump
s
announcement
has
upset
commanders
who
view
his
decision
as
a
betrayal
of
the
kurdish
ypg
militia
which
has
led
the
fight
to
eradicate
islamic
state
from
northeastern
syria
ankara
views
the
ypg
as
an
extension
of
a
kurdish
insurgency
inside
turkey
turkey
has
threatened
to
launch
an
offensive
against
the
ypg
raising
fears
of
a
surge
in
violence
that
could
harm
hundreds
of
thousands
of
civilians
the
united
states
told
the
ypg
that
they
would
be
armed
by
washington
until
the
fight
against
islamic
state
was
completed
one
of
the
officials
said
the
fight
isn
t
over
we
can
t
simply
start
asking
for
the
weapons
back
said
the
official
the
proposal
to
leave
weapons
with
the
ypg
which
could
include
missiles
armoured
vehicles
and
mortars
would
reassure
kurdish
allies
that
they
were
not
being
abandoned
but
turkey
wants
the
united
states
to
take
the
weapons
back
so
the
commanders
recommendation
if
confirmed
could
complicate
trump
s
plan
to
allow
turkey
to
finish
off
the
fight
against
islamic
state
inside
syria
the
pentagon
keeps
records
of
the
weapons
it
has
supplied
to
the
ypg
and
their
chain
of
custody
but
the
officials
said
it
would
be
nearly
impossible
to
locate
all
of
the
equipment
how
are
we
going
to
get
them
back
and
who
is
going
to
take
them
back
one
of
the
officials
asked
the
debate
over
whether
to
leave
weapons
with
the
ypg
coincides
with
trump
s
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
s
visit
to
turkey
and
israel
next
week
for
talks
on
syria
in
may
the
united
states
started
distributing
arms
and
equipment
to
the
ypg
for
an
offensive
against
raqqa
the
de
facto
capital
of
the
caliphate
that
islamic
state
overran
in
iraq
and
syria
in
the
united
states
told
turkey
that
it
would
take
back
the
weapons
after
the
defeat
of
islamic
state
which
has
lost
all
but
a
few
slivers
of
territory
in
northeastern
syria
the
idea
that
we
d
be
able
to
recover
them
is
asinine
so
we
leave
them
where
they
are
said
a
official
a
person
familiar
with
the
discussions
of
the
withdrawal
plan
said
the
white
house
and
turkish
president
tayyip
erdogan
would
oppose
the
proposal
to
allow
the
ypg
to
keep
its
weapons
the
recommendation
is
a
rejection
of
trump
s
policy
to
withdraw
from
syria
said
the
person
who
asked
not
to
be
further
identified
turkey
has
said
weapons
supplied
to
the
ypg
have
in
the
past
ended
up
in
the
hands
of
its
kurdish
separatists
and
described
any
weapon
given
to
the
insurgents
as
a
threat
to
turkey
s
security
a
phone
call
between
trump
and
erdogan
led
to
the
decision
to
withdraw
all
forces
from
syria
in
the
call
two
weeks
ago
trump
had
been
expected
to
deliver
a
standard
warning
to
the
turkish
president
over
his
plan
to
launch
a
crossborder
attack
targeting
kurdish
forces
in
northeast
syria
officials
said
instead
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
trump
reshaped
policy
in
the
middle
east
abandoning
a
quarter
of
syrian
territory
and
handing
turkey
the
job
of
finishing
off
islamic
state
in
syria
