'new dawn' breaking for uk pay growth, says boe's haldane
london
reuters
signs
of
a
new
dawn
in
british
wage
growth
are
growing
after
years
of
stagnation
but
the
in
pay
is
likely
to
be
limited
the
bank
of
england
s
chief
economist
andy
haldane
said
on
wednesday
haldane
contrasted
the
situation
with
a
year
ago
when
he
said
there
had
been
a
number
of
false
dawns
on
pay
and
repeated
failings
on
the
part
of
the
boe
in
forecasting
higher
pay
now
with
the
end
of
a
government
cap
on
pay
rises
and
a
steady
rise
in
the
average
level
of
pay
deals
pay
growth
was
turning
a
corner
i
think
there
is
more
compelling
evidence
of
a
new
dawn
breaking
for
pay
growth
albeit
with
the
light
filtering
through
only
slowly
he
said
in
a
speech
at
a
conference
held
by
britain
s
acas
labour
dispute
arbitration
service
british
workers
are
earning
less
than
they
did
years
ago
before
the
global
financial
crisis
when
adjusted
for
inflation
and
haldane
highlighted
headwinds
to
pay
if
trends
in
automation
and
the
dominance
of
big
businesses
intensified
haldane
said
the
limited
and
gradual
outlook
for
pay
rises
was
being
reflected
in
bets
by
investors
that
the
central
bank
will
raise
interest
rates
by
only
about
a
quarter
of
a
percentage
point
a
year
over
the
next
three
years
the
boe
pushed
up
borrowing
costs
for
only
the
second
time
since
the
financial
crisis
in
august
taking
them
to
percent
from
percent
the
boe
forecasts
pay
growth
including
bonuses
will
rise
to
percent
by
the
end
of
next
year
up
from
percent
in
the
most
recent
data
before
hitting
percent
by
the
end
of
however
the
boe
has
often
produced
pay
growth
forecasts
that
were
too
high
which
haldane
said
was
largely
due
to
about
productivity
and
an
underestimation
of
how
much
unemployment
could
fall
without
pushing
up
wages
more
recently
pay
appeared
to
be
rising
in
line
with
boe
forecasts
but
haldane
said
in
the
longer
term
there
was
a
risk
of
downward
pressure
on
pay
growth
from
reduced
worker
bargaining
power
automation
and
less
competition
between
businesses
a
fall
in
recent
decades
in
the
proportion
of
britons
in
trade
unions
had
probably
reduced
pay
growth
by
around
percentage
points
a
year
if
britain
reached
levels
of
automation
over
the
next
decade
pay
growth
could
be
lowered
by
about
percentage
points
a
year
and
levels
of
business
concentration
could
reduce
pay
growth
by
percentage
points
haldane
said
britain
s
government
appointed
haldane
on
monday
to
chair
a
committee
looking
at
how
to
improve
productivity
weak
management
appears
a
bigger
problem
in
britain
than
in
other
countries
