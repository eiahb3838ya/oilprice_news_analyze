china's ties with taiwan chip firms under scrutiny as u.s. trade war heats up

washington
s
decision
to
cut
off
supplies
to
a
chinese
spotlights
mounting
tensions
over
china
s
drive
to
be
a
global
player
in
computer
chips
and
the
ways
in
which
taiwan
companies
are
helping
it
get
there
shut
out
of
major
global
semiconductor
deals
in
recent
years
china
has
been
quietly
strengthening
cooperation
with
taiwan
chip
firms
by
encouraging
the
transfer
of
expertise
into
the
mainland
taiwan
chip
giant
united
microelectronics
corp
umc
last
week
halted
research
and
development
activities
with
its
chinese
partner
fujian
jinhua
integrated
circuit
co
ltd
following
the
move
taiwan
firms
such
as
umc
have
helped
supply
china
with
a
steady
pipeline
of
chip
expertise
in
exchange
for
access
to
the
chip
market
there
china
has
faced
a
shortage
of
integrated
circuit
ic
chips
for
years
in
it
imported
billion
worth
of
semiconductors
more
than
its
imports
of
crude
oil
at
least
joint
ventures
or
technology
partnerships
have
been
set
up
in
the
last
few
years
between
chinese
and
taiwanese
firms
according
to
industry
experts
luring
taiwanese
talent
with
hefty
salaries
and
generous
perks
such
companies
will
need
to
also
take
care
to
ensure
no
patent
or
ip
infringement
is
involved
as
the
has
export
control
means
to
restrict
support
of
critical
technology
said
randy
abrams
an
analyst
at
credit
suisse
in
taipei
among
the
most
valuable
partnerships
for
china
would
be
ones
that
strengthen
its
foundry
services
and
memory
chip
production
those
two
sectors
require
help
from
overseas
firms
due
to
the
complexity
of
the
manufacturing
technologies
and
intense
capital
requirements
analysts
have
said
but
the
technology
transfer
between
china
and
taiwan
has
raised
concerns
amid
the
trade
war
and
escalating
tensions
across
the
taiwan
strait
china
has
aggressively
used
subsidies
and
forced
technology
transfers
to
capture
traditional
and
emerging
technology
industries

these

cooperation
with
china
cautiously
and
has
implemented
policies
to
ensure
taiwan
s
most
advanced
technology
is
not
transferred
when
businesses
go
to
the
mainland
to
invest
in
wafer
production
they
must
accept
controls
including
one
that
requires
the
manufacturing
technology
to
be
a
generation
behind
the
economics
ministry
s
industrial
development
bureau
said
in
a
statement
to
reuters
cooperation
between
umc
and
fujian
jinhua
came
under
scrutiny
last
month
when
the
government
put
the
chinese
company
on
a
list
of
entities
that
can
not
buy
components
software
and
technology
goods
from
firms
amid
allegations
it
stole
intellectual
property
from
micron
technology
fujian
jinhua
denied
the
allegations
fujian
jinhua
now
faces
big
challenges
to
reach
commercial
high
volume
production
as
expected
in
industry
observers
say
last
week
both
umc
and
fujian
jinhua
which
was
only
founded
in
were
charged
with
conspiring
to
steal
trade
secrets
from
micron
in

taiwanese
tech
companies
need
to
carefully
their
positions
and
supply
chain
arrangements
as
the
tension
between
the
two
super
powers
escalates
bernstein
analyst
mark
li
said
while
china
will
need
at
least
six
years
before
it
can
catch
up
in
chip
manufacturing
according
to
some
estimates
the
scale
of
its
abilities
is
already
seen
as
a
threat
in
other
parts
of
the
chip
supply
chain
barely
years
after
breaking
ground
on
a
wafer
plant
in
china
nexchip
a
joint
venture
between
the
chinese
city
of
hefei
and
taiwan
dram
maker
powerchip
started
producing
wafers
a
month
wafers
are
thin
pieces
of
material
usually
consisting
of
silicon
used
to
make
semiconductor
chips
nexchip
s
main
goal
is
to
produce
liquid
crystal
display
driver
ics
for
makers
using
powerchip
s
resources
and
taiwanese
talent
which
make
up
a
quarter
of
its
employees
nexchip
is
helping
reduce
china
s
reliance
on
foreign
chip
suppliers
with
an
aim
to
become
the
world
s
chipmaker
for
display
drivers
nexchip
plans
to
build
three
more
wafer
plants
and
ramp
up
its
monthly
production
to
wafers
by
according
to
a
person
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
matter
after
visiting
nexchip
late
last
year
researchers
from
taiwan
s
chip
hub
hsinchu
science
park
said
progress
at
the
hefei
plant
was
a
breakthrough
this
will
likely
increase
taiwan
firms
needs
to
invest
in
the
china
market
and
it
will
be
a
test
