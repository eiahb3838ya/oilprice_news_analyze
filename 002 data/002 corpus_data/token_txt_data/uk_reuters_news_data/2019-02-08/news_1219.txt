numbers
are
fleeing
economic
meltdown

life
threatening
to
overwhelm
neighbouring

peru
this
month
tightened
entry
rules
for
venezuelans
requiring
them
to
carry
passports
instead
of
just
national
id
cards
though
a
judge
in
ecuador
on
friday
rolled
back
a
similar
rule
enacted
there
describing
those
events
as
early
warning
signs
a
spokesman
for
the
international

funding
and
means

venezuelans
more
than
million
of

the
rest
of
their
family
pregnant
women

the

unhcr
spokesman
andrej
mahecic
said
on
friday
that
governments
had
made
commendable
efforts
even
though
some
reception
capacities
and
services
were
overwhelmed
but
he
said
some
disturbing
images
had
emerged
from
the
region
in
the
past
week
that
risked
stigmatizing
venezuelans
who
had
fled
and
complicating
efforts
to
integrate
them
an
ecuadorean
judge
judith
naranjo
on
friday
lifted
an
order
requiring
that
venezuelans
hold
passports
to
be
allowed
entry
in
response
to
a
lawsuit
filed
by
ecuador
s
state
ombudsman
together
with
local
human
rights
groups
the
judge
accepted
the
request
for
the
precautionary
measures
requested
by
the
ombudsman
the
agency
wrote
on
twitter
ecuador
s
government
said
it
would
respect
the
decision
to
allow
migrants
to
enter
on
their
venezuelan
identification
cards
but
it
said
that
the
identification
cards
would
have
to
be
accompanied
by
a
certificate
of
validation
issued
by
venezuela
or
an
international
agency
recognised
by
ecuador
ecuador
said
the
measure
was
intended
to
protect
its
own
citizens
it
did
not
say
when
it
would
take
effect
venezuela
s
information
minister
jorge
rodriguez
said
on
friday
that
a
new
package
of
economic
measures
meant
to
address
hyperinflation
would
win
over
venezuelans
who
had
left
the
country
venezuela
on
monday
cut
five
zeros
from
prices
and
pegged
the
country
s
currency
to
an
obscure
cryptocurrency
critics
slammed
the
plan
as
inadequate
in
the
face
of
inflation
that
topped
percent
in
july
and
is
expected
to
reach
million
percent
this
year
the
conclusion
is
that
venezuelans
are
going
to
return
and
furthermore
we
invite
them
to
return
because
we
need
them
for
this
recovery
