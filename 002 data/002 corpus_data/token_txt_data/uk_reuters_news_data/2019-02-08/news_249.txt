london
reuters
a
smiling
construction
worker
a
grinning
farmer
and
a
jolly
pensioner
these
are
the
cartoon
faces
the
government
is
using
to
try
to
reassure
britons
that
the
country
can
cope
with
a
brexit
a
cheery
illustrated
banner
on
a
new
government
website
sits
atop
links
to
information
on
how
to
prepare
for
a
brexit
that
critics
have
said
could
cause
food
and
medicine
shortages
long
border
delays
and
widespread
economic
disruption
on
tuesday
the
government
launched
the
site
with
a
public
information
campaign
consisting
of
adverts
on
commercial
radio
stations
and
tweets
from
some
government
departments
a
radio
advert
broadcast
on
lbc
radio
at
around
gmt
featured
a
range
of
voice
actors
asking
questions
about
renewing
passports
mobile
phone
charges
and
exporting
goods
it
directed
them
to
the
new
website
for
answers
the
site
covers
all
exit
scenarios
and
includes
previously
published
advice
on
topics
ranging
from
new
restrictions
on
taking
pets
on
holiday
to
extra
paperwork
when
importing
goods
from
the
bloc
with
less
than
three
months
until
britain
leaves
the
eu
prime
minister
theresa
may
is
struggling
to
win
parliamentary
approval
for
her
brexit
deal
increasing
the
chances
that
the
country
ends
up
leaving
without
a
deal
a
exit
is
the
default
scenario
if
may
s
deal
is
rejected
and
the
prospect
of
supply
chain
disruption
and
blocked
ports
has
in
recent
weeks
pushed
companies
and
the
government
to
ramp
up
contingency
planning
some
brexit
supporters
say
a
exit
is
the
only
way
to
truly
leave
the
bloc
and
that
warnings
of
the
economic
consequences
have
been
overblown
to
drum
up
support
for
may
s
deal
the
department
in
charge
of
planning
did
little
to
herald
the
launch
of
the
information
campaign
on
tuesday
but
has
previously
said
it
would
be
stepped
up
in
coming
weeks
to
include
billboard
advertisements
and
other
media
