harare
reuters
zimbabwe
s
opposition
accused
the
election
commission
on
tuesday
of
deliberately
delaying
results
of
this
week
s
vote
to
favour
the
ruling
party
reporting
irregularities
in
the
first
poll
since
the
removal
of
robert
mugabe
in
a
november
coup
even
though
the
election
passed
off
peacefully
several
water
cannon
trucks
patrolled
outside
the
central
harare
headquarters
of
the
opposition
movement
for
democratic
change
mdc
as
its
supporters
danced
in
the
streets
some
local
results
from
parallel
parliamentary
elections
have
been
declared
but
the
zimbabwe
electoral
commission
zec
has
yet
to
produce
any
figures
from
monday
s
presidential
vote
zec
chief
priscilla
chigumba
said
the
presidential
result
may
not
be
ready
until
saturday
former
mdc
finance
minister
tendai
biti
and
zesn
the
main
domestic
election
monitor
said
one
in
five
polling
stations
more
than
in
all
had
not
physically
posted
tallies
on
their
doors
as
required
by
law
that
omission
gave
room
for
the
zec
which
zesn
and
the
opposition
have
accused
of
bias
to
manipulate
the
results
in
favour
of
president
emmerson
mnangagwa
and
the
ruling
party
biti
said
there
is
a
deliberate
delay
in
formally
announcing
results
biti
told
a
news
conference
characterising
it
as
interference
with
the
people
s
will
zesn
and
other
civil
society
groups
were
preparing
a
legal
challenge
to
force
the
results
into
the
open
biti
said
zec
said
there
was
no
rigging
or
cheating
in
the
vote
whose
credibility
is
vital
in
zimbabwe
s
attempts
to
emerge
from
the
pariah
status
and
economic
decay
into
which
it
sank
in
the
latter
half
of
mugabe
s
nearly
four
decades
in
charge
however
zec
did
not
explain
the
failure
by
the
polling
stations
to
post
results
the
poll
is
a
race
between
mnangagwa
a
security
chief
who
took
over
after
mugabe
s
removal
and
mdc
leader
nelson
chamisa
both
men
have
expressed
confidence
in
victory
although
western
diplomats
and
local
observer
groups
said
the
race
which
saw
a
turnout
of
percent
was
too
close
to
call
the
information
from
our
representatives
on
the
ground
is
extremely
positive
mnangagwa
said
on
his
official
twitter
feed
chamisa
had
earlier
said
he
was
poised
for
victory
writing
on
twitter
awaiting
zec
to
perform
their
constitutional
duty
to
officially
announce
the
people
s
election
results
and
we
are
ready
to
form
the
next
as
well
as
electing
a
president
zimbabweans
were
voting
for
members
of
parliament
and
more
than
councillors
the
final
outcome
may
not
be
known
until
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
winner
a
will
be
held
on
the
winner
must
put
zimbabwe
back
on
track
after
years
under
mugabe
tainted
by
corruption
mismanagement
and
diplomatic
isolation
that
brought
one
of
africa
s
most
promising
economies
to
its
knees
election
monitor
sources
said
monday
s
vote
appeared
to
have
passed
without
major
foul
play
although
they
noted
some
coercion
and
intimidation
of
voters
in
rural
areas
by
and
said
state
media
was
biased
towards
the
ruling
party
chamisa
questioned
the
independence
of
the
zec
and
said
voters
were
being
suppressed
in
urban
areas
where
he
is
popular
has
denied
any
misconduct
whatever
the
outcome
unrest
remains
possible
if
the
mdc
loses
and
contests
the
result
there
could
be
street
protests
protracted
court
battles
could
also
spark
violence
and
delay
economic
reforms
should
mnangagwa
lose
many
zimbabweans
fear
some
in
the
ruling
party
may
not
accept
the
result
particularly
given
the
huge
risks
some
senior
cadres
and
army
officers
took
in
removing
mugabe
some
of
the
organisers
of
the
coup
are
now
in
government
including
vice
president
constantino
chiwenga
mnangagwa
and
have
said
they
will
accept
the
result
but
after
a
string
of
questionable
elections
under
mugabe
many
zimbabweans
remained
sceptical
if
this
guy
loses
there
is
no
way
they
will
hand
over
power
said

at
a
huge
banner
of
mnangagwa
hanging
on
a
building
in
harare
those
who
have
the
guns
have
the
power
this
is
several
civil
society
groups
are
collating
results
from
polling
posts
in
parallel
with
zec
but
are
not
allowed
to
release
results
early
a
source
at
one
group
said
it
was
too
early
to
call
a
winner
but
it
was
looking
very
close
in
the
capital
harare
an
mdc
stronghold
results
posted
outside
some
polling
stations
showed
chamisa
winning
by
wide
margins
but
mnangagwa
was
expected
to
claw
back
ground
in
s
rural
heartland
urban
results
tend
to
emerge
quicker
than
those
from
rural
outposts
the
to
monday
s
vote
was
peaceful
compared
with
past
elections
under
mugabe
where
the
ruling
party
and
veterans
of
the
independence
struggle
were
accused
of
violence
against
opponents
dozens
of
people
were
killed
ahead
of
a
runoff
in
between
mugabe
and
morgan
tsvangirai
who
died
of
cancer
in
february
mugabe
emerged
on
the
eve
of
the
election
to
announce
he
would
vote
for
the
opposition
surprising
mnangagwa
who
accused
him
of
striking
a
deal
