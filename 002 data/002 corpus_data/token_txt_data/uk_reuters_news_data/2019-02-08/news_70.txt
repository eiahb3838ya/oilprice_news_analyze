output
going
forward
vale
will
cut

of
its
output
by
decommissioning
dams
chief

triggered
a

rally
in

as
well
as
a
broader
bounce
in

futures
and
shares
of
rival

initiative
aims
to
tough
questions

disaster
coming
after
a
similar
deadly
dam
collapse
in

the
nearby

which
vale
with

the

involves

rose
lifting

in
our

published
over
the
last
few
days
we
highlighted
that
the
two
main
uncertainties
in
the
area
of
financial
impact
were
the
impact
on
short
and
production
and
potential
legal
actions
stemming
from
the
event
xp
strategist
karel
luketic
said
in
a
research
note
vale
s
announcement
helps
ease
worries
relative
to
the
first
uncertainty
mentioned
production
luketic
said
he
said
xp
was
maintaining
its
forecast
for
iron
ore
priced
around
for
the
years
covered
by
the
production
plan
but
added
the
cuts
could
support
prices
above
that
a
vale
shareholder
group
has
asked
brazil
s
securities
regulator
cvm
to
investigate
the
company
s
conduct
alleging
vale
did
not
fulfill
its
obligation
to
disclose
the
risks
and
impact
of
its
activities
at
the
mine
vale
said
it
will
postpone
its
planned
february
earnings
and
production
releases
until
march
as
a
result
of
