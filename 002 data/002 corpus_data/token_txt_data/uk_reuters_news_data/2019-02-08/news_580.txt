in
the
heart
of
belfast
s
unionist
community
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
uncompromising
resistance
of
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
northern
irish
allies
to
her
brexit
deal
here

and

can
buy
the
flutes
and
drums
played
during
the
province
s
divisive
marching
season
i
often
say
that
people
in
northern
ireland
are
probably
more
british
than
people
in
the
mainland
said
shop
owner
david
milleken
who
drums
in
one
of
the
many
marching
bands
that
hold
annual
parades
to
mark
protestant
military
victories
dating
back
to
the
century
we
should
be
treated
exactly
the
same
we
voted
as
the
uk
to
leave
not
as
individual
nations
so
i
wouldn
t
be
happy
at
being
treated
any
differently
from
someone
in
england
scotland
or
unionists
like
milleken
fear
their
culture
and
identity
would
be
eroded
by
a
provision
in
the
draft
deal
that
could
align
northern
ireland
more
closely
with
the
eu
than
the
rest
of
the
united
kingdom
the
northern
ireland
backstop
that
aims
to
keep
open
the
border
between
the
british
province
and
eu
member
ireland
has
provoked
ministerial
resignations
in
london
fury
among
the
democratic
unionist
party
dup
who
helped
may
form
a
government
and
left
the
divorce
deal
hanging
by
a
thread
but
elsewhere
in
northern
ireland
some
unionists
are
being
won
over
by
a
deal
vehemently
opposed
by
the
dup
their
only
representative
party
at
westminster
amid
widespread
support
from
business
groups
a
significant
backer
emerged
on
thursday
when
the
ulster
farmers
union
a
group
traditionally
close
to
unionists
said
the
deal
while
not
ideal
would
protect
the
livelihoods
of
its
members
and
called
on
the
dup
to
vote
in
favour
of
it
brexit
has
become
overly
political
and
emotive
we
are
focussed
on
what
is
best
for
the
future
of
farm
businesses
in
northern
ireland
said
ivor
ferguson
president
of
the
ufu
which
did
not
take
a
position
during
the
referendum
on
eu
membership
ultimately
we
would
like
a
solution
full
stop
however
this
agreement
does
provide
an
insurance
policy
to
prevent
a
no
deal
outcome
which
would
be
disastrous
for
farm
businesses
and
the
economy
in
northern
northern
ireland
voted
to
percent
to
remain
in
the
european
union
in
the
referendum
when
the
united
kingdom
as
a
whole
voted
by
a
small
margin
to
leave
research
by
queens
university
suggested
a
sharp
split
between
an
overwhelming
proportion
of
catholic
irish
nationalists
voting
to
remain
and
most
protestant
unionists
who
themselves
still
make
up
the
majority
of
the
province
s
million
population
opting
to
leave
three
decades
of
sectarian
bloodshed
between
nationalists
who
want
to
unite
with
ireland
and
unionists
who
want
to
remain
part
of
the
uk
left
dead
before
a
peace
deal
many
feel
that
deal
would
be
threatened
by
the
return
of
border
checks
with
customs
posts
a
possible
target
for
small
militant
nationalist
groups
unionists
are
more
british
because
of
the
period
known
as
the
troubles
says
milleken
who
voted
dup
in
the
british
election
that
cemented
its
position
as
the
dominant
unionist
force
and
handed
its
mps
the
balance
of
power
in
parliament
in
london
not
all
of
those
voters
share
dup
positions
such
as
opposition
to
gay
marriage
and
abortion
they
back
the
party
because
choosing
a
smaller
more
moderate
unionist
rival
would
only
hand
an
advantage
to
nationalist
sinn
fein
the
former
political
wing
of
the
ira
whose
ultimate
goal
is
to
unite
the
island
of
ireland
i
m
a
protestant
which
i
am
proud
of
but
i
also
have
gay
friends
and
i
also
have
catholic
friends
i
have
friends
from
all
sides
of
the
community
from
different
ethnic
backgrounds
and
the
dup
don
t
want
us
all
to
be
inclusive
said
stephen
mooney
a
butcher
working
in
the
protestant
shankill
road
it
s
just
the
red
white
and
blue
it
s
just
a
protestant
thing
it
s
nothing
to
do
with
the
dup
s
views
because
i
don
t
agree
with
them
but
i
vote
dup
because
of
red
white
and
blue
who
else
do
you
vote
for
but
once
the
dup
gets
involved
the
dup
will
want
it
their
way
and
they
will
not
sway
either
way
he
added
in
a
reference
to
the
party
s
opposition
to
the
deal
still
surveys
since
the
referendum
suggest
views
on
brexit
have
not
changed
dramatically
over
the
last
two
years
an
opinion
poll
in
september
showed
that
percent
of
voters
in
northern
ireland
want
a
second
brexit
referendum
with
percent
against
and
percent
undecided
nationalists
were
percent
in
favour
unionists
percent
opposed
while
many
unionists
fear
that
keeping
the
province
more
aligned
with
the
eu
could
boost
calls
for
a
united
ireland
others
point
to
the
divergence
that
already
exists
with
the
uk
on
social
issues
like
gay
marriage
and
in
regulations
such
as
veterinary
checks
we
already
live
with
differences
here
and
i
think
the
people
on
the
ground
know
that
said
eileen
weir
who
swapped
membership
of
a
paramilitary
group
as
a
teenager
for
decades
of
relations
work
in
the
shankill
area
we
have
the
good
friday
agreement
and
that
s
the
only
thing
that
can
take
us
out
of
the
united
kingdom
not
a
brexit
the
people
will
decide
whether
we
become
part
of
a
united
ireland
or
stay
within
the
uk
and
until
that
day
comes
i
think
it
s
a
bit
of
scaremongering

the
