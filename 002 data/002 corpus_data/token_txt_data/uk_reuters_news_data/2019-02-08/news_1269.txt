washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
faced
an
unprecedented
outcry
from
former
intelligence
officials
on
friday
after
stripping
the
security
clearance
of
former
cia
director
john
brennan
but
trump
defended
his
move
and
said
he
planned
another
one
soon
the
bipartisan
group
which
included
robert
gates
george
tenet
david
petraeus
james
clapper
and
leon
panetta
lashed
out
at
the
president
in
a
scathing
letter
released
late
on
thursday
by
friday
evening
another
former
intelligence
officers
added
their
voices
in
their
own
letter
brennan
a
former
official
in
the
obama
administration
and
sharp
critic
of
trump
has
said
he
will
not
be
deterred
by
the
removal
of
his
security
clearance
brennan
described
trump
s
actions
at
a
summit
with
russian
president
vladimir
putin
in
helsinki
last
month
as
treasonous
in
an
interview
on
msnbc
on
friday
night
brennan
did
not
back
down
on
his
criticism
of
trump
s
conduct
as
president
but
he
did
walk
back
his
comment
in
july
that
trump
s
behavior
in
helsinki
was
nothing
short
of
i
didn
t
mean
that
he
committed
treason
but
it
was
a
term
that
i
used
nothing
short
of
treasonous
brennan
said
in
the
interview
trump
defended
his
decision
announced
on
wednesday
saying
it
had
elevated
the
former
cia
chief
rather
than
hampering
his
freedom
of
speech
the
president
also
told
reporters
he
was
likely
to
revoke
the
clearance
of
bruce
ohr
a
department
of
justice
official
who
is
linked
to
a
dossier
on
trump
s
campaign
and
russia
that
was
compiled
by
former
british
spy
christopher
steele
trump
lashed
out
again
at
special
counsel
robert
mueller
who
is
leading
an
investigation
into
possible
collusion
between
his
campaign
and
moscow
without
citing
evidence
or
offering
proof
trump
said
that
mueller
had
conflicts
of
interest
in
the
statement
released
late
on
thursday
officials
who
served
under
republican
and
democratic
officials
said
they
did
not
necessarily
agree
with
brennan
s
harsh
criticism
of
the
president
but
that
security
authorizations
should
be
based
on
national
security
not
politics
we
all
agree
that
the
president
s
action
regarding
john
brennan
and
the
threats
of
similar
action
against
other
former
officials
has
nothing
to
do
with
who
should
and
should
not
hold
security
clearances
and
everything
to
do
with
an
attempt
to
stifle
free
speech
the
former
cia
directors
deputy
directors
and
directors
of
national
intelligence
said
we
have
never
before
seen
the
approval
or
removal
of
security
clearances
used
as
a
political
tool
they
wrote
petraeus
one
of
the
signers
was
once
considered
by
trump
as
a
candidate
for
secretary
of
state
like
the
signatories
of
the
first
letter
the
former
cia
officers
said
that
while
they
do
not
necessarily
agree
with
brennan
s
opinions
it
is
our
firm
belief
that
the
country
will
be
weakened
if
there
is
a
political
litmus
test
applied
before
seasoned
experts
are
allowed
to
share
their
the
second
group
included
henry
crumpton
who
also
served
as
the
state
department
s
top
official
and
letitia
long
a
former
head
of
the
national
agency

oversees
the
military
satellites

for
intelligence
collection
navigation
and
communication

another

oversaw
the
operation
that

laden
praised
brennan
and
asked
trump
to
revoke
his
own
security
clearance
as
well
writing
in
a
washington
post
opinion
piece
that
he
would
consider
it
an
trump
challenged
the
suggestion
that
he
was
trying
to
silence
critics
by
taking
away
security
clearances
there
s
no
silence
if
anything
i
m
giving
them
a
bigger
voice
trump
said
many
people
don
t
even
know
who
brennan
is
and
now
he
has
a
bigger
voice
and
that
s
ok
with
me
because
i
like
taking
on
voices
like
that
i
ve
never
respected
the
white
house
said
it
was
studying
a
list
of
other
individuals
for
security
clearance
review
and
trump
suggested
ohr
was
at
the
top
of
that
list
i
think
bruce
ohr
is
a
disgrace
he
said
i
suspect
i
ll
be
taking
it
