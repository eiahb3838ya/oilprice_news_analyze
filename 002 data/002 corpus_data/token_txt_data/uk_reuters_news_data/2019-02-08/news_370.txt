london
reuters
britain
has
not
looked
in
detail
at
how
to
revoke
its
article
notice
to
leave
the
european
union
as
the
government
does
not
plan
to
do
so
attorney
general
geoffrey
cox
said
on
thursday
on
monday
the
european
union
s
top
court
ruled
that
the
british
government
may
reverse
its
article
notice
to
leave
the
bloc
without
consulting
other
member
states
the
giving
of
notice
of
article
would
not
just
be
an
easy
matter
of
pressing
a
button
and
the
revocability
takes
effect
cox
told
parliament
asked
if
he
believed
legislation
would
be
required
to
revoke
article
or
whether
it
could
be
done
by
a
vote
in
parliament
cox
said
that
is
a
matter
that
is
under
review
certainly
let
me
say
very
clearly
that
the
question
of
what
legal
route
would
be
required
to
trigger
it
is
not
one
that
has
been
considered
at
any
length
because
there
is
no
intention
to
do
