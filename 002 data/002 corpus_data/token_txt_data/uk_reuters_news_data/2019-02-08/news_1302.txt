risk of no-deal brexit rising, 'everyone needs to prepare' - hunt
helsinki
reuters
the
risk
of
a
brexit
has
been
increasing
and
the
european
union
commission
needs
to
change
its
attitude
if
a
deal
is
to
be
reached
foreign
secretary
jeremy
hunt
said
on
tuesday
everyone
needs
to
prepare
for
the
possibility
of
a
chaotic
brexit
hunt
told
reporters
in
helsinki
with
less
than
eight
months
until
britain
quits
the
eu
the
government
has
yet
to
agree
a
divorce
deal
with
brussels
and
has
stepped
up
planning
for
the
possibility
of
leaving
the
bloc
without
any
formal
agreement
i
think
the
risk
of
a
no
brexit
deal
has
been
increasing
recently
there
is
absolutely
no
guarantee
that
we
will
get
a
deal
hunt
said
after
a
meeting
with
his
finnish
counterpart
timo
soini
but
it
s
not
what
anyone
wants
and
i
hope
very
much
that
we
ll
find
a
way
to
avoid
that
the
british
government
has
been
doing
everything
it
can
to
avoid
that
outcome
he
said
we
do
need
to
see
a
change
in
approach
by
the
european
both
london
and
brussels
say
they
want
to
get
a
divorce
deal
at
the
eu
council
but
diplomats
think
that
target
date
is
too
optimistic
eu
brexit
negotiator
michel
barnier
rejected
key
elements
of
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
new
trade
proposals
last
month
economists
say
a
failure
to
agree
the
terms
of
the
divorce
would
cause
serious
harm
to
the
world
s
economy
as
trade
with
the
eu
britain
s
largest
market
would
become
subject
to
tariffs
supporters
of
brexit
say
there
may
be
some
pain
for
the
economy
but
that
it
will
prosper
when
cut
free
from
the
eu
meanwhile
some
mps
are
pushing
for
a
rerun
of
the
referendum
