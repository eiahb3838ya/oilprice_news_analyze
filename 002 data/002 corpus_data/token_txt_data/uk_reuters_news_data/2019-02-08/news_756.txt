british
airways
owner
iag

friday
posted
an
unexpected
profit

from
rising
fuel
prices
that
have
hit
the
industry
iag
which
also
owns
aer
lingus

iberia
beat
consensus
expectations
of
a
fall
in
profits
even
as
jet
fuel
prices
increased
beyond
what
the
airline
group
had
planned
for
the
fuel
price
is
certainly
higher
than
we
had
expected
but
the
general
trading
environment
is
good
chief
executive
willie
walsh
said
noting
europe
had
been
especially
strong
without
saying
what
destinations
had
been
in
particular
demand
we
ve
seen
high
oil
prices
before
and
we
know
what
to
shares

to
pence
by

making
them
the
top
gainers
in
the
ftse
and
extending
a
rebound
from
tuesday
low
of
not
only
is
the
group
adding
more
flights
it
s
managing
to
fill
more
seats
on
its
planes
while
also
getting
a
benefit
from
pricing
said
george
salmon
analyst
at
hargreaves
lansdown
take
out
the
impact
of
higher
fuel
prices
and
unfavourable
currency
moves
and
it
becomes
clear
iag
is
doing
some
pretty
impressive
work
on
underlying
operating
improvements

added
iag
said
profit
for
would
increase
by
million
euros
million
pounds
having
previously
said
it
would
show
an
increase
for
the

before
exceptional
items
reached

ahead
of
a
consensus
of
billion
and
up
from
billion

costs
for
the
three
months
to
rose

at
constant
currency
rates
iag
said
echoing
comments
on
thursday
by
budget
airline
norwegian
air
which
rebuffed
a
bid
from
iag
earlier
in
the
year
norwegian
which
competes
with
british
airways
on
transatlantic
routes
posted
results
which
lagged
estimates
due
to
the
higher
fuel
price
fellow
nordic
airline
primera
air
went
bust
earlier
this
month
and
walsh
said
it
was
no
surprise
that
smaller
airlines
which
can
t
hedge
their
fuel
costs
had
gone
out
of
business
i
would
expect
to
see
more
of
this
during
the
remaining
part
of
this
year
and
going
into
the
early
part
of
next
year
given
the
fuel
price
where
it
is
walsh
said
he
said
there
was
nothing
new
to
say
in
relation
to
iag
s
interest
in
norwegian
in
august
he
said
iag
remained
interested
in
buying
norwegian
but
there
were
no
active
discussions
walsh
also
declined
comment
when
asked
to
estimate
the
cost
of
a
theft
of
customer
data
at
ba
after
iag
said
on
thursday
hackers
may
have
stolen
the
personal
information
of
a
further
customers
taking
the
total
number
of
payment
cards
potentially
affected
