labour party to vote against may's brexit deal, senior mp says
london
reuters
britain
s
opposition
labour
party
is
set
to
vote
against
any
brexit
deal
reached
by
prime
minister
theresa
may
and
the
lack
of
a
viable
exit
from
the
european
union
will
force
may
from
office
before
christmas
a
senior
labour
lawmaker
told
the
financial
times
the
united
kingdom
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
on
march
and
yet
little
is
clear
there
is
so
far
no
full
exit
agreement
and
some
rebels
in
may
s
conservative
party
have
threatened
to
vote
down
a
deal
if
she
clinches
one
if
rebels
in
her
party
do
vote
against
a
deal
the
fate
of
may
s
government
and
the
whole
exit
process
would
depend
on
labour
because
she
would
not
command
the
votes
needed
to
carry
parliament
emily
thornberry
labour
s
foreign
secretary
in
waiting
told
the
ft
that
a
workable
deal
was
just
not
going
to
happen
under
may
labour
has
set
six
tests
for
supporting
any
brexit
deal
but
thornberry
said
she
saw
little
chance
of
any
may
deal
satisfying
them
i
can
t
see
them
coming
back
with
a
deal
that
is
going
to
meet
our
six
tests
and
i
can
t
see
them
coming
back
with
a
deal
that
will
unite
the
tory
party
for
heaven
s
sake
thornberry
told
the
thornberry
said
there
would
need
to
be
a
national
election
within
months
given
the
likelihood
that
the
prime
minister
would
be
defeated
on
the
crucial
vote
on
any
brexit
deal
they
are
not
capable
of
governing
we
re
either
going
to
have
a
general
election
in
the
autumn
or
we
re
going
to
have
it
in
the
spring
she
said
thornberry
said
she
wanted
a
national
election
rather
than
another
referendum
