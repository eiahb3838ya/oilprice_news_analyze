normality returns for some in damascus after fighting ends
damascus
reuters
some
people
in
the
syrian
capital
damascus
have
been
able
to
enjoy
a
semblance
of
normality
since
fighting
in
the
area
ended
in
may
but
in
the
rubble
of
shattered
destitute
towns
nearby
life
could
not
be
more
different
central
damascus
was
held
by
the
government
throughout
the
war
and
suffered
much
less
damage
than
areas
evidence
of
the
huge
gulf
in
fire
power
between
the
two
sides
parts
of
the
eastern
ghouta
region
just
outside
damascus
were
all
but
flattened
during
a
government
offensive
this
spring
to
retake
it
from
rebels
when
the
area
surrendered
tens
of
thousands
of
its
people
both
fighters
and
civilians
chose
to
leave
eastern
ghouta
under
safe
passage
for
opposition
areas
in
northern
syria
rather
than
come
back
under
government
rule
others
decided
to
stay
the
risk
of
being
hit
by
bullets
or
shellfire
near
the
capital
has
now
ended
but
conditions
in
central
damascus
with
its
relaxed
nightlife
and
bustling
business
district
seem
a
world
away
from
the
hardship
of
eastern
ghouta
president
bashar
s
success
in
the
war
owes
much
to
russia
which
entered
the
war
on
his
side
in
and
whose
soldiers
are
now
a
common
sight
in
areas
even
during
the
fighting
people
in
damascus
would
go
out
in
the
evenings
to
eat
drink
and
dance
but
this
summer
the
bars
and
restaurants
of
the
old
city
were
much
busier
during
the
war
when
bombs
were
falling
it
could
be
days
without
customers
but
we
never
stopped
working
said
dana
a
bar
tender
mixing
a
blue
moon
cocktail
in
a
shaker
barber
shops
do
good
business
and
cafes
spill
out
onto
the
cobbled
streets
of
the
old
city
on
weekend
evenings
this
was
the
first
summer
since
without
the
sound
of
fighting
in
damascus
at
a
wedding
outside
the
city
the
noise
came
rather
from
student
rock
band
kibreet
a
drummer
two
guitarists
and
a
singer
the
groom
was
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
his
friends
and
family
as
people
clapped
around
him
he
swung
his
bride
in
his
arms
her
white
dress
billowing
out
behind
only
a
few
miles
away
in
the
eastern
ghouta
city
of
douma
rubble
is
all
around
in
one
bulletpocked
building
a
young
man
on
the
fifth
floor
was
shovelling
debris
from
a
balcony
preparing
the
flat
for
entire
streets
seem
destroyed
at
one
of
the
area
s
biggest
hospitals
where
huge
shell
holes
are
blown
into
the
walls
medics
are
still
operating
out
of
the
basement
a
woman
held
up
a
small
boy
on
a
bed
grimacing
as
he
waited
for
the
doctor
to
give
an
injection
in
the
ravaged
streets
a
small
boy
pushed
a
cart
selling
cooked
sweetcorn
cobs
between
ruined
buildings
the
fighting
in
douma
only
ended
a
few
months
ago
but
any
significant
reconstruction
might
be
very
distant
syria
can
not
afford
a
major
rebuilding
programme
its
closest
allies
russia
and
iran
seem
unlikely
to
foot
the
bill
western
nations
will
pay
no
cash
without
a
political
transition
in
district
of
homs
retaken
by
the
government
in
the
slow
nature
of
recovery
is
clear
much
of
it
is
a
ghost
town
uninhabited
and
closed
by
the
army
in
one
area
boys
played
soccer
near
buildings
so
pancaked
by
bombs
that
the
floors
and
ceilings
hung
down
closely
on
top
of
each
other
their
goal
was
made
of
two
rusting
oil
drums
with
posts
sticking
up
and
a
wire
tied
between
them
as
the
crossbar
the
covered
souk
used
to
be
chockablock
but
now
very
few
people
come
to
this
area
said
abu
fares
a
shop
owner
in
the
old
city
of
homs
even
among
the
young
people
enjoying
the
nightlife
in
damascus
the
challenge
of
the
long
slow
economic
recovery
ahead
means
many
people
are
thinking
of
leaving
i
like
my
job
i
like
bars
and
night
life
here
but
in
the
end
i
would
like
to
move
out
of
syria
i
don
t
see
a
future
here
said
rasha
a
bar
owner
when
there
was
war
here
and
we
had
bombs
falling
every
day
i
never
wanted
to
leave
but
now
yes
