special
counsel
robert
mueller
s
office
on
friday
disputed
key
elements
of
a
media
report
that
president
donald
trump
directed
his
former
lawyer
to
lie
to
congress
about
a
moscow
real
estate
deal
raising
questions
about
a
story
that
has
dominated
news
coverage
for
the
past
hours
buzzfeed
news
reported
late
on
thursday
that
michael
cohen
trump
s
former
lawyer
who
is
slated
to
go
to
prison
for
lying
to
congress
and
other
crimes
told
investigators
working
for
mueller
that
trump
had
instructed
him
to
lie
about
efforts
to
build
a
skyscraper
in
moscow
while
he
was
running
for
president
buzzfeed
s
description
of
specific
statements
to
the
special
counsel
s
office
and
characterization
of
documents
and
testimony
obtained
by
this
office
regarding
michael
cohen
s
congressional
testimony
are
not
accurate
peter
carr
a
spokesman
for
mueller
said
in
the
special
counsel
s
first
comment
on
a
media
report
since
its
probe
started
months
ago
while
carr
did
not
directly
address
whether
there
was
evidence
that
trump
directed
cohen
to
lie
to
congress
he
disputed
portions
of
the
story
about
how
buzzfeed
corroborated
the
explosive
allegations
against
trump
citing
information
from
two
federal
law
enforcement
officials
buzzfeed
said
cohen
told
the
special
counsel
that
after
the
presidential
election
trump
instructed
him
to
tell
congress
that
negotiations
over
the
moscow
project
had
ended
earlier
than
they
had
in
order
to
obscure
trump
s
involvement
carr
s
statement
also
appeared
to
dispute
buzzfeed
s
assertion
that
the
special
counsel
learned
about
trump
s
directive
from
interviews
with
employees
of
the
trump
organization
emails
text
messages
and
other
documents
buzzfeed
ben
smith
said
in
a
statement
we
stand
by
the
reporting
and
the
sources
who
informed
it
and
we
urge
the
special
counsel
to
make
clear
what
he
s
after
the
buzzfeed
report
was
published
on
thursday
night
investigators
in
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
said
they
planned
to
investigate
the
allegations
while
some
democrats
described
the
report
as
a
that
if
true
could
be
grounds
for
impeaching
the
president
earlier
on
friday
the
white
house
said
the
story
was
false
look
that
s
absolutely
ridiculous
spokeswoman
sarah
sanders
told
reporters
david
weinstein
a
former
federal
prosecutor
said
mueller
s
decision
to
comment
highlighted
the
significance
of
the
allegations
made
in
the
buzzfeed
article
and
the
attention
it
was
getting
in
the
media
and
among
lawmakers
they
are
making
a
public
comment
to
tell
everyone
to
calm
down
weinstein
said
he
doesn
t
want
people
to
think
his
silence
is
confirming
the
truthfulness
of
the
trump
said
on
twitter
that
cohen
was
lying
to
get
less
prison
time
trump
s
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
said
in
a
statement
that
any
suggestion
that
trump
told
cohen
to
lie
is
categorically
representatives
for
the
trump
organization
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
the
buzzfeed
report
cohen
who
once
said
he
was
so
loyal
to
trump
that
he
would
take
a
bullet
for
him
is
scheduled
to
begin
a
prison
sentence
in
march
after
pleading
guilty
to
charges
including
campaign
finance
violations
tax
evasion
and
lying
to
congress
if
trump
did
tell
cohen
to
lie
that
would
constitute
criminal
activity
said
house
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerrold
nadler
a
democrat
he
added
that
he
would
look
into
the
matter
directing
a
subordinate
to
lie
to
congress
is
a
federal
crime
nadler
said
on
twitter
house
intelligence
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
said
the
allegation
that
trump
may
have
directed
cohen
to
lie
under
oath
is
among
the
most
serious
to
we
will
do
what
s
necessary
to
find
out
if
it
s
true
schiff
also
a
democrat
said
on
twitter
some
senate
intelligence
committee
investigators
hope
to
ask
cohen
about
the
buzzfeed
report
when
he
testifies
behind
closed
doors
in
february
a
committee
source
told
reuters
he
also
will
face
questions
about
it
in
testimony
before
the
house
oversight
committee
on
yet
mueller
s
move
to
push
back
on
the
buzzfeed
report
could
give
some
lawmakers
pause
while
also
giving
ammunition
to
allies
of
trump
in
their
efforts
to
criticize
the
media
and
in
their
calls
for
mueller
to
complete
his
probe
today
s
development
only
underscores
the
need
for
the
special
counsel
to
wrap
this
investigation
up
immediately
republican
representative
mark
meadows
said
on
twittter
the
constant
secrecy
and
breathless
speculation
helps
no
legal
experts
said
the
allegation
if
true
exposed
trump
to
a
new
level
of
risk
in
an
investigation
that
has
already
resulted
in
convictions
of
or
guilty
pleas
from
four
former
campaign
aides
including
chairman
paul
manafort
if
true
it
s
a
seismic
event
andy
wright
an
associate
white
house
counsel
under
former
democratic
president
barack
obama
told
reuters
cohen
his
left
arm
in
a
sling
did
not
comment
as
he
entered
his
apartment
building
in
new
york
on
friday
his
adviser
lanny
davis
also
declined
to
comment
to
reuters
and
his
lawyer
guy
petrillo
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
trump
denounced
cohen
as
a
rat
after
he
began
cooperating
with
investigators
while
cohen
whose
duties
included
making
payoffs
to
two
women
who
said
they
had
affairs
with
trump
said
on
thursday
he
regretted
giving
my
blind
loyalty
to
a
man
who
doesn
t
deserve
directing
or
encouraging
someone
to
lie
under
oath
is
a
crime
known
as
subornation
of
perjury
the
report
also
raises
questions
about
obstruction
of
justice
and
conspiracy
william
barr
trump
s
nominee
to
be
attorney
general
said
at
his
confirmation
hearing
on
tuesday
that
a
president
would
be
committing
obstruction
if
he
directed
a
subordinate
to
lie
under
oath
a
justice
department
spokeswoman
declined
to
comment
while
the
justice
department
has
previously
concluded
that
a
sitting
president
can
not
be
charged
while
in
office
such
an
allegation
if
found
true
could
fuel
impeachment
proceedings
in
congress
trump
repeatedly
has
denied
collusion
with
russia
and
slammed
mueller
s
investigation
as
a
witch
russia
also
has
rejected
intelligence
findings
that
moscow
interfered
in
politics
in
the
election
in
an
effort
to
boost
trump
trump
said
during
the
presidential
campaign
that
he
had
no
ties
or
business
dealings
with
russia
democrats
who
took
over
the
house
of
representatives
this
month
have
generally
been
cautious
regarding
any
talk
of
impeachment
to
remove
trump
from
office
although
some
members
have
pushed
for
such
a
resolution
impeachment
proceedings
would
face
an
uphill
battle
in
the
senate
where
trump
s
fellow
republicans
have
a
majority
buzzfeed
also
reported
that
cohen
regularly
updated
trump
s
son
donald
trump
and
his
daughter
ivanka
trump
who
is
now
a
top
white
house
adviser
about
the
moscow
project
a
spokesman
for
abbe
lowell
a
lawyer
for
ivanka
trump
said
she
was
minimally
involved
in
the
development
trump
who
has
also
testified
previously
before
congress
in
a
twitter
post
called
the
buzzfeed
report
fake
after
mueller
s
statement
disputing
the
report
trump
called
out
the
media
and

a
