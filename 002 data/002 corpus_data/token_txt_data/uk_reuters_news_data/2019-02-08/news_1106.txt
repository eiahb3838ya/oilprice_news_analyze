new
york
reuters
serena
williams
behaviour
in
saturday
s
open
final
divided
the
tennis
world
after
she
called
the
chair
umpire
a
liar
and
a
thief
and
said
he
treated
her
differently
than
male
players
during
her
loss
to
naomi
osaka
williams
who
was
seeking
a
grand
slam
singles
title
on
saturday
was
handed
a
warning
for
a
coaching
violation
before
being
deducted
a
point
for
smashing
her
racquet
she
then
had
a
heated
argument
with
chair
umpire
carlos
ramos
which
cost
her
a
game
the
open
champion
who
has
since
been
fined
by
the
united
states
tennis
association
for
the
violations
vigorously
disputed
each
during
the
match
in
the
wake
of
osaka
s
first
grand
slam
triumph
there
were
messages
of
support
for
williams
as
well
as
those
condemning
her
behaviour
and
agreeing
with
the
umpire
s
calls
tennis
great
billie
jean
king
wrote
on
twitter
when
a
woman
is
emotional
she
s
hysterical
and
she
s
penalized
for
it
when
a
man
does
the
same
he
s
outspoken
and
there
are
no
repercussions
thank
you
serenawilliams
for
calling
out
this
double
standard
more
voices
are
needed
to
do
the
yet
australian
margaret
court
whose
tally
of
grand
slam
singles
titles
is
being
chased
by
williams
had
little
sympathy
for
the
american
former
world
number
one
we
always
had
to
go
by
the
rules
court
who
dominated
tennis
during
the
and
early
said
according
to
a
report
in
the
australian
it
s
sad
for
the
sport
when
a
player
tries
to
become
bigger
than
the
rules
because
the
young
player
outplayed
her
in
the
first
set
i
think
pressure
got
her
more
than
the
drama
started
when
ramos
handed
williams
a
coaching
violation
early
in
the
second
set
because
of
hand
gestures
made
from
the
stands
by
her
coach
patrick
mouratoglou
he
later
admitted
to
coaching
which
is
an
offence
in
the
sport
though
one
rarely
called
when
the
violation
was
announced
williams
approached
ramos
to
say
she
never
takes
coaching
and
would
rather
lose
than
cheat
to
win
things
seemed
to
settle
down
as
williams
went
on
to
break
osaka
for
a
lead
but
she
gave
the
break
right
back
in
the
next
game
with
a
pair
of
double
faults
prompting
the
former
champion
to
smash
her
racquet
on
the
court
that
resulted
in
a
second
violation
meaning
osaka
was
awarded
the
first
point
of
the
sixth
game
williams
who
was
under
the
impression
the
first
violation
had
been
rescinded
returned
to
ramos
to
seek
an
apology
for
saying
she
had
received
coaching
earlier
during
a
changeover
williams
resumed
her
argument
with
the
umpire
this
time
saying
he
was
attacking
her
character
and
was
a
thief
that
triggered
a
third
violation
which
resulted
in
a
game
penalty
that
gave
osaka
a
lead
from
there
williams
summoned
the
tournament
referee
to
the
court
and
said
male
tennis
players
were
not
punished
for
similar
offences
tennis
great
john
mcenroe
one
of
the
game
s
most
tempestuous
characters
in
his
playing
days
said
the
sport
must
find
a
way
to
allow
players
to
express
feelings
and
inject
their
personality
into
the
game
while
adhering
to
the
rules
ramos
should
not
have
given
williams
a
violation
for
breaking
her
racquet
and
should
have
warned
her
early
on
about
what
would
happen
if
she
did
not
move
on
he
said
i
ve
said
far
worse
mcenroe
a
grand
slam
singles
winner
said
on
espn
she
s
right
about
the
guys
being
held
to
a
different
standard
there
s
no
however
richard
ings
a
former
professional
chair
umpire
who
also
used
to
be
the
atp
tour
executive
rules
and
competition
felt
it
was
williams
who
needed
to
apologise
ings
once
issued
a
warning
point
penalty
and
a
game
penalty
against
mcenroe
at
the
open
for
obscenities
directed
at
the
umpire
we
should
not
let
her
record
as
glowing
as
it
is
overshadow
the
fact
that
on
this
day
in
this
match
williams
was
wrong
ings
wrote
in
the
sydney
morning
herald
the
decisions
made
by
ramos
had
nothing
to
do
with
sexism
or
racism
they
had
everything
to
do
with
observing
clear
breaches
of
the
grand
slam
code
of
conduct
and
then
having
the
courage
to
call
them
without
fear
or
a
spokeswoman
for
williams
did
not
immediately
respond
when
asked
to
comment
on
the
remarks
from
court
and
ings
while
the
usta
said
it
does
not
make
chair
umpires
available
to
the
media
according
to
the
official
grand
slam
rule
book
a
first
infraction
gets
a
warning
a
second
offence
results
in
a
point
penalty
while
a
third
brings
about
a
game
penalty
the
rule
book
also
states
that
players
who
receive
coaching
during
a
match
or
intentionally
destroy
a
racquet
shall
be
penalised
in
accordance
with
the
point
