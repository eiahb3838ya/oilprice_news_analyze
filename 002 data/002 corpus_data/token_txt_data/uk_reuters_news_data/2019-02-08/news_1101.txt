sweden
faces
a
political
impasse
after
its
mainstream
and
blocs
virtually
tied
in
an
election
on
sunday
while
the
which
neither
wants
to
deal
with
made
gains
on
a
hardline
platform
with
nearly
all
votes
counted
on
monday
the
ruling
social
democrats
and
greens
and
their
left
party
parliamentary
ally
had
percent
of
the
vote
while
the
opposition
alliance
was
on
percent
that
translates
into
a
advantage
in
the
riksdag
the
sweden
democrats
a
party
with
white
supremacist
roots
won
percent
about
percentage
points
more
than
four
years
ago
it
was
the
biggest
gain
of
any
party
and
in
line
with
conventional
opinion
polls
but
fell
short
of
the
percent
their
leader
jimmie
akesson
had
predicted
the
sweden
democrats
success
follows
a
rise
in
popularity
of
other
parties
in
europe
amid
growing
anxiety
over
national
identity
the
effects
of
globalisation
and
fears
over
immigration
boosted
by
conflicts
in
the
middle
east
and
africa
akesson
was
adamant
his
party
holds
the
balance
of
power
we
won
t
participate
in
letting
through
a
government
which
doesn
t
give
us
influence
he
told
on
the
contrary
we
will
do
what
we
can
to
bring
down
any
such
akesson
s
overtures
found
few
takers
with
a
letter
inviting
the
moderates
and
christian
democrats
to
talks
being
instantly
and
publicly
rebuffed
unless
parties
on
the
and
break
ranks
with
their
blocs
it
is
likely
to
be
impossible
to
form
a
stable
government
without
some
kind
of
support
from
the
sweden
democrats
who
want
the
country
to
leave
the
european
union
and
freeze
immigration
liberal
party
leader
jan
bjorklund
said
he
wanted
to
form
a
minority
government
and
seek
cooperation
with
the
social
democrats
or
the
greens
he
said
the
complicated
situation
meant
he
could
not
completely
rule
out
supporting
a
social
government
but
said
he
would
rather
leave
the
alliance
than
work
with
the
sweden
democrats
should
any
party
in
the
alliance
start
cooperating
with
the
sweden
democrats
then
the
alliance
will
fall
but
it
will
not
happen
he
said
in
an
interview
for
swedish
television
many
online
surveys
which
in
the
last
election
had
gauged
the
sweden
democrats
vote
better
than
conventional
polls
had
signalled
they
could
dethrone
the
social
democrats
as
the
nation
s
biggest
party
a
position
the
has
held
for
a
century
in
the
end
the
sweden
democrats
were
beaten
by
prime
minister
stefan
lofven
s
social
democrats
by
a
percentage
point
margin
and
eclipsed
also
by
the
moderates
of
ulf
kristersson
the
alliance
s
candidate
for
the
premiership
in
some
sense
we
re
happy
the
sweden
democrats
didn
t
grow
more
than
they
did
liberal
party
lawmaker
allan
widman
told
reuters
the
bigger
they
become
the
more
hard
pressed
all
other
parties
graphic
election
result
sweden
saw
itself
as
a
humanitarian
superpower
for
years
but
a
rise
in
gang
violence
in
deprived
city
suburbs
has
also
won
support
for
the
sweden
democrats
after
the
arrival
of
asylum
seekers
in
the
most
in
europe
in
relation
to
the
country
s
population
of
million
the
government
suspended
many
of
its
liberal
asylum
policies
there
was
a
sense
of
relief
among
supporters
of
mainstream
parties
about
the
s
less
dramatic
gains
that
was
shared
in
brussels
it
is
clear
that
the
claim
that
the
is
on
an
inexorable
roll
and
will
devour
everything
that
stands
in
its
way
is
false
said
one
eu
official
still
the
swedish
election
underscored
a
broader
shift
to
the
right
in
one
of
europe
s
most
socially
progressive
nations
senior
figures
in
the
mainstream
parties
headed
into
meetings
on
monday
to
produce
a
strategy
for
forming
a
government
but
the
process
could
take
weeks
and
possibly
fail
akesson
challenged
kristersson
to
choose
between
seeking
support
from
the
sweden
democrats
for
an
alliance
government
or
accepting
four
more
years
of
lofven
as
prime
minister
kristersson
called
on
lofven
to
resign
but
also
rebuffed
akesson
we
have
been
completely
clear
during
the
whole
election
the
alliance
will
not
govern
or
discuss
how
to
form
a
government
with
the
sweden
democrats
he
said
both
sides
laid
claim
to
being
best
placed
to
form
a
government
although
votes
from
swedes
living
abroad
are
not
due
to
be
declared
until
wednesday
and
these
could
still
sway
the
final
outcome
slightly
yet
in
the
same
breath
leaders
of
both
sides
called
for
bipartisan
accommodation
to
avoid
gridlock
in
parliament
the
scenario
of
a
bipartisan
coalition
is
highly
uncertain
and
parties
have
ruled
together
only
a
handful
of
times
since
the
also
a
accord
to
neutralise
the
sweden
democrats
and
let
the
biggest
bloc
rule
proved
deeply
unpopular
among
grassroot
members
and
rapidly
unravelled
the
moderates
the
biggest
party
in
the
alliance
are
not
interested
in
cooperating
with
the
social
democrats
and
any
such
deal
would
also
raise
questions
about
democratic
accountability
voters
might
see
the
sweden
democrats
as
the
country
s
only
opposition
party
a
new
election
will
be
called
if
parliament
doesn
t
agree
on
a
prime
minister
after
four
attempts
