ceo
of
genesis
global

in
new

one
of
the
biggest
trading
desks
folks
who
are
risking
type
of
leverage
it
s
really
difficult
to
think
of
that
as
an
investment
it
s
a
casino
others
blamed
fears
that
last
week
s
hard
fork
in
bitcoin
cash
where
a
software
upgrade
split
the
coin
into
two
separate
currencies
could
destabilize
others
the
price
of
bitcoin
tends
to
be
sensitive
to
debates
over
how
its
underlying
network
evolves
last
year
the
suspension
of
hard
fork
planned
by
major
developers
and
investors
proved
a
major
catalyst
to
its
breakneck
rise
mainstream
investors
have
stayed
clear
of
bitcoin
with
concerns
over
scant
regulatory
oversight
and
undeveloped
market
infrastructure
compounded
by
frequent
swings
in
price
that
lack
of
involvement
has
seen
bitcoin
struggle
to
live
up
to
its
billing
as
something
that
will
revolutionize
world
finance
its
usage
as
a
payment
currency
has
shriveled
this
year
at
the
same
time
bitcoin
s
plunge
in
value
has
calmed
the
fears
of
regulators
and
central
bankers
that
it
could
one
day
pose
a
risk
to
financial
stability
according
to
industry
tracker
the
total
value
of
cryptocurrencies
is
now
around
billion
down
from
a
peak
of
around
billion
in
january
cryptocurrency
advocates
say
bitcoin
is
still
young
and
price
volatility
is
to
be
expected
many
predict
the
need
for
virtual
currencies
that
operate
beyond
mainstream
banking
will
outlast
any
price
falls
by
late
afternoon
xrp
and
ether
were
trading
around
and
respectively
on
the
bitstamp
exchange
the
euphoria
has
died
and
prices
have
consolidated
with
lower
lows
and
lower
highs
