paris
reuters
french
president
emmanuel
macron
s
popularity
has
hit
a
record
low
following
the
resignation
of
a
popular
minister
and
a
summer
scandal
over
his
bodyguard
a
poll
showed
on
thursday
only
percent
of
those
surveyed
reported
a
favourable
opinion
of
macron
in
september
down
from
percent
last
month
the
yougov
poll
for
le
huff
post
and
cnews
found
macron
s
popularity
is
low
in
most
polls
but
the
yougov
survey
pegged
it
worse
than
others
and
indicated
poor
ratings
across
the
political
spectrum
the
former
investment
banker
has
sold
his
reform
drive
on
promises
that
it
will
boost
growth
and
jobs
but
many
voters
ranging
from
conservative
pensioners
to
workers
complain
his
policies
mostly
benefit
companies
and
the
rich
he
was
dealt
a
blow
last
week
with
the
surprise
resignation
of
his
environment
minister
a
popular
former
activist
and
tv
presenter
during
a
live
radio
interview
in
july
his
leadership
was
put
to
the
test
when
a
scandal
broke
out
as
video
emerged
showing
his
top
bodyguard
beating
may
day
protesters
meanwhile
soft
economic
data
has
raised
questions
about
whether
he
has
the
right
recipe
for
growth
while
hesitation
over
a
tax
collection
reform
has
painted
him
as
unusually
indecisive
his
government
has
repeatedly
shrugged
off
poor
poll
ratings
insisting
it
will
not
waver
on
the
reform
agenda
as
politically
sensitive
overhauls
of
unemployment
insurance
and
pensions
loom
in
the
months
ahead
the
yougov
poll
was
conducted
