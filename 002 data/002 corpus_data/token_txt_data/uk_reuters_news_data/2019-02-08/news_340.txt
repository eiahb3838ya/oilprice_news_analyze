no christmas cheer for fashion firms in never-ending sales
reuters
clothing
retailers
have
felt
a
chill
slicing
through
their
margins
as
they
try
to
lure
shoppers
to
spend
rather
than
hold
off
in
anticipation
of
price
cuts
this
has
left
investors
worried
whether
recent
profit
warnings
which
have
spread
to
online
players
such
as
british
online
store
asos
from
retailers
may
be
a
taste
of
the
future
monday
s
warning
from
asos
a
player
seen
as
better
placed
than
most
to
weather
shopper
fatigue
raised
concerns
about
weakening
consumer
strength
globally
and
even
hit
shares
in
internet
retail
giant
amazon
we
have
seen
in
fashion
an
unprecedented
amount
of
discounting
certainly
not
something
i
ve
seen
before
and
that
s
been
across
the
board
asos
chief
executive
nick
beighton
told
analysts
whether
this
is
a
high
street
or
an
online
issue
isn
t
relevant
right
now
what
is
is
the
underlying
fragility
of
the
customer
beighton
added
while
online
retailing
has
made
shoppers
more
savvy
comparing
prices
and
trawling
more
widely
for
discounts
factors
ranging
from
street
demonstrations
in
paris
to
unseasonable
weather
have
been
blamed
for
a
reluctance
to
buy
new
clothes
fashion
chains
including
primark
superdry
and
italy
s
ovs
have
all
warned
of
weak
sales
in
the
crucial
to
christmas
and
while
zara
owner
inditex
resisted
discounting
it
reported
disappointing
sales
customer
behavior
is
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
to
predict
stefano
beraldo
chief
executive
officer
at
ovs
said
last
week
after
an
percent
drop
in
sales
most
retailers
have
responded
by
expanding
their
traditional
summer
and
new
year
sales
to
promotions
even
in
the
crucial
christmas
period
when
they
have
previously
counted
on
shifting
stock
at
full
price
discounting
has
been
building
for
a
number
of
years
and
has
gone
with
the
rise
of
online

samantha
dover
senior
retail
analyst
at
market
research
firm
mintel
said
a

a

a

rail
at

chain
top
shop
in
london
s
canary
wharf
financial
district
she
said
she
was
always
attracted
to
a
bargain
and
would
definitely
compare
prices
online
before
buying
although
if
she
needed
an
item
she
would
buy
it
at
full
price
deloitte
says
consumers
in
britain
are
enjoying
record
price
cuts
with
discounts
at
an
average
of
percent
and
likely
to
hit
a
new
record
by
christmas
eve
the
consultancy
expects
the
number
of
sale
days
at
british
retailers
to
be
as
many
as
this
year
six
more
than
research
by
mintel
shows
almost
half
of
british
consumers
have
delayed
buying
clothing
to
see
if
it
goes
on
promotion
at
upmarket
fashion
chain
reiss
banker
daniel
radford
said
he
wouldn
t
shop
just
anywhere
for
a
bargain
but
depending
on
the
brand
it
can
be
important
sales
are
happening
all
the
time
now
he
said
adding
that
in
the
case
of
a
item
he
would
wait
for
it
to
be
discounted
promotional
activities
like
black
friday
have
meant
shoppers
expect
discounts
earlier
in
the
season
while
they
can
also
shop
around
more
easily
and
compare
prices
people
are
going
to
buy
where
the
discounts
are
and
then
that
hits
margins
across
the
board
said
maureen
hinton
global
retail
research
director
at
globaldata
some
clothing
retailers
have
adapted
better
than
others
to
changing
shopping
habits
inditex
has
set
the
pace
with
its
tight
control
of
inventory
meaning
it
is
able
to
leverage
its
network
of
stores
and
online
apps
to
sell
items
at
full
price
h
m
however
has
had
to
mark
down
prices
as
it
failed
to
react
quickly
to
demand
swings
some
of
which
have
resulted
from
changing
weather
patterns
or
increasingly
fickle
tastes
driven
by
a
growing
army
of
online
influencers
setting
trends
another
factor
in
the
mix
this
autumn
has
been
troubles
such
as
political
unrest
in
france
and
fears
about
britain
leaving
the
european
union
which
have
kept
shoppers
at
home
leaving
piles
of
unsold
clothing
the
french
retail
federation
has
estimated
stores
have
lost
at
least
billion
euros
as
a
result
of
four
weeks
of
yellow
vest
protests
in
france
and
german
retailers
have
been
disappointed
by
christmas
sales
so
far
the
german
retail
association
said
capping
off
a
weak
we
had
a
year
of
soft
trading
in
germany
george
garfield
weston
ceo
of
primark
owner
ab
foods
said
last
month
german
retailers
including
zalando
and
metro
like
others
in
northern
europe
have
blamed
unseasonable
weather
for
weak
demand
