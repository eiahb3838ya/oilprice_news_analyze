singapore

myanmar
government
leader
aung
san
suu
kyi
said
on
tuesday
her
relationship
with
the
military
which
held
her
under
house
arrest
for
nearly
years
was
not
that
bad
and
that
the
generals
in
her
cabinet
were
rather
sweet
however
suu
kyi
who
has
been
criticised
for
failing
to
speak
out
against
an
army
crackdown
in
rakhine
state
that
the
united
nations
has
called
ethnic
cleansing
said
she
hoped
constitutional
change
would
eventually
curb
the
military
s
influence
our
relationship
with
the
army
is
not
that
bad
the
nobel
peace
prize
laureate
and
the
face
of
myanmar
s
democratic
awakening
said
at
an
event
in
singapore
in
response
to
a
question
about
whether
she
feared
another
military
coup
don
t
forget
that
we
have
three
members
of
the
cabinet
who
are
in
fact
military
men
generals
and
they
re
all
rather
the
military
ruled
myanmar
for
nearly
years
after
seizing
power
in
a
coup
the
generals
have
initiated
reforms
beginning
in
late
with
suu
kyi
s
release
from
house
arrest
and
they
have
largely
stepped
back
from
the
running
of
the
country
handing
over
to
suu
kyi
s
government
after
her
party
swept
a
election
but
the
military
retains
considerable
powers
under
a
constitution
and
suu
kyi
barred
under
that
constitution
from
becoming
president
said
the
transition
to
democracy
was
still
incomplete
suu
kyi
did
not
mention
by
name
the
rohingya
muslims
more
than
of
whom
have
fled
from
the
north
of
rakhine
state
into
bangladesh
since
an
army
crackdown
that
began
a
year
ago
after
attacks
on
security
posts
by
rohingya
insurgents
the
attacks
were
launched
by
the
arakan
rohingya
salvation
army
which
myanmar
says
is
a
terrorist
group
and
suu
kyi
said
terrorism
remained
a
threat
which
could
have
grave
consequences
for
the
wider
region
the
danger
of
terrorist
activities
which
was
the
initial
cause
of
events
leading
to
the
humanitarian
crisis
in
rakhine
remains
real
and
present
today
she
said
unless
this
security
challenge
is
addressed
the
risk
of
violence
will
remain
it
is
a
threat
that
could
have
grave
consequences
not
just
for
myanmar
but
also
for
other
countries
in
our
region
and
myanmar
has
rejected
accusations
of
ethnic
cleansing
and
dismissed
most
accounts
from
refugees
of
atrocities
instead
blaming
rohingya
terrorists
myanmar
and
bangladesh
reached
an
agreement
late
last
year
on
the
repatriation
of
rohingya
most
of
whom
are
stateless
and
subjected
to
restrictions
in
myanmar
suu
kyi
said
spaces
have
been
mapped
out
for
the
resettlement
of
people
who
fled
she
also
stressed
the
difficulties
that
other
small
ethnic
and
religious
groups
living
in
rakhine
state
face
there
are
not
just
the
muslims
in
rakhine
like
most
people
think
there
s
hindus
there
there
are
small
ethnic
groups
and
i
would
like
you
to
take
interest
in
these
small
ethnic
groups
because
some
of
them
are
disappearing
very
quickly
she
said
they
live
in
their
own
traditional
ways
they
re
very
peaceful
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
help
them
to
preserve
their
culture
their
traditions
and
to
help
them
on
plans
for
rohingya
refugees
to
return
to
myanmar
she
said
it
was
difficult
to
set
a
time
frame
suggesting
the
onus
was
on
bangladesh
to
get
the
process
started
the
returnees
have
to
be
sent
back
by
bangladesh
we
can
only
welcome
them
at
the
border
she
said
i
think
bangladesh
would
also
have
to
decide
how
quickly
it
wants
the
process
to
be
the
rohingya
who
regard
themselves
as
native
to
rakhine
state
are
widely
considered
as
interlopers
by
myanmar
s
buddhist
majority
and
are
denied
citizenship
