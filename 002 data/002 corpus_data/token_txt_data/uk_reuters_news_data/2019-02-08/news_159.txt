london
reuters
jeremy
corbyn
leader
of
britain
s
opposition
labour
party
will
reiterate
on
monday
his
willingness
to
talk
to
prime
minister
theresa
may
on
ways
to
break
the
deadlock
over
brexit
but
not
while
the
government
wastes
money
on
brinkmanship
after
seeing
her
deal
to
leave
the
european
union
resoundingly
defeated
in
parliament
last
week
may
has
opened
talks
with
lawmakers
from
all
parties
to
try
to
find
a
way
to
move
forward
with
brexit
she
is
due
to
return
to
parliament
on
monday
to
outline
her
plans
but
with
just
weeks
before
britain
is
due
to
leave
in
march
and
little
concrete
yet
to
have
come
out
of
those
talks
some
lawmakers
are
trying
to
wrest
more
control
over
brexit
the
future
of
brexit
britain
s
biggest
shift
in
foreign
and
trade
policy
since
world
war
two
has
never
been
so
uncertain
corbyn
has
said
he
will
enter
into
talks
with
may
only
if
the
prime
minister
rules
out
a
brexit
a
scenario
in
which
britain
leaves
without
an
agreement
and
one
that
some
businesses
say
would
be
disastrous
for
the
economy
we
re
ready
to
talk
to
the
government
and
others
in
parliament
about
a
sensible
alternative
plan
but
not
while
theresa
may
is
wasting
pounds
an
hour
of
taxpayers
money
on
dangerous
and
unnecessary
brinkmanship
he
said
in
a
statement
if
the
prime
minister
is
serious
about
finding
a
solution
that
can
command
support
in
parliament
and
bring
our
country
together
she
must
listen
to
the
majority
of
mps
lawmakers
as
well
as
members
of
her
own
cabinet
and
take
no
deal
off
the
labour
said
some
of
its
top
team
would
visit
businesses
around
the
country
on
monday
to
discuss
the
dangers
of
a
no
deal
brexit
on
sunday
trade
minister
liam
fox
said
may
s
plan
was
still
the
best
basis
for
a
divorce
deal
he
suggested
it
could
win
support
from
parliament
with
a
few
tweaks
to
the
northern
irish
backstop
an
insurance
policy
to
ensure
no
return
to
a
hard
border
between
the
british
province
and
ireland
