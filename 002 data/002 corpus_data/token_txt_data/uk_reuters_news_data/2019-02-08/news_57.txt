a matter of life and death? uk stockpiles drugs as no-deal brexit feared
london
reuters
with
just
days
until
britain
leaves
the
eu
jo
elgarf
has
begun
stockpiling
food
in
case
politicians
fail
to
strike
an
exit
deal
but
she
says
she
can
not
do
the
same
with
vital
drugs
her
disabled
daughter
needs
nora
has
cerebral
palsy
and
epilepsy
and
relies
on
imported
epilim
and
keppra
daily
to
stop
her
suffering
seizures
elgarf
wants
to
stock
up
on
the
drugs
in
case
supplies
are
hit
but
she
can
t
because
they
are
only
available
on
a
monthly
prescription
for
nora
this
could
be
matter
of
life
and
death
elgarf
told
reuters
at
her
home
in
southwest
london
it
could
mean
being
sent
off
in
an
ambulance
to
hospital
with
a
massive
seizure
that
lasts
five
minutes
plus
she
can
not
miss
those
medicines
there
s
no
ifs
and
buts
about
it
and
we
can
not
use
alternatives
with
the
clock
ticking
british
lawmakers
are
still
struggling
to
agree
a
withdrawal
treaty
with
the
european
union
having
comprehensively
rejected
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
agreement
last
month
the
default
position
means
britain
will
leave
on
march
without
a
deal
in
place
unless
something
can
be
agreed
beforehand
that
has
led
to
fears
that
supply
chains
will
be
severely
disrupted
leading
to
shortages
of
food
and
medicines
according
to
the
british
government
about
of
medicines
used
by
the
national
health
service
nhs
come
via
the
eu
may
a
type
diabetic
has
said
she
herself
relies
on
insulin
produced
in
another
eu
country
last
august
health
secretary
matt
hancock
outlined
plans
to
ensure
britain
had
an
extra
six
weeks
of
supplies
in
the
event
of
a
brexit
in
january
he
said
britain
had
bought
fridges
to
hold
medicines
making
him
the
biggest
buyer
of
fridges
in
the
world
and
secured
warehouse
space
making
sure
patients
continue
to
have
access
to
the
medicines
they
need
is
paramount
said
health
minister
responsible
for
brexit
planning
stephen
hammond
we
are
working
extremely
closely
with
industry
to
make
sure
there
are
significant
supplies
of
these
drugs
in
the
uk
hammond
wrote
in
an
article
last
week
but
some
britons
do
not
share
that
confidence
and
anecdotal
evidence
from
newspaper
readers
suggests
people
are
stockpiling
everything
from
children
s
painkillers
to
medicines
for
serious
conditions
for
elgarf
a
member
of
facebook
group
per
cent
preppers
a
reference
to
the
percentage
that
voted
to
remain
in
the
eu
in
the
referendum
that
is
not
an
option
and
that
has
left
her
fearful
it
doesn
t
matter
even
if
i
had
all
the
money
in
the
world
i
can
t
go
and
buy
these
medicines
because
they
are
i
have
no
way
of
securing
my
child
s
future
she
said
it
is
not
just
patients
and
their
families
who
are
concerned
the
chief
executive
of
a
body
running
hospitals
in
birmingham
england
s
city
warned
last
week
there
was
a
risk
operations
could
be
canceled
because
of
a
drug
shortage
in
the
event
of
a
chaotic
exit
many
nhs
trusts
could
quickly
run
out
of
vital
medical
supplies
dr
dave
rosser
wrote
in
a
memo
to
his
board
of
directors
he
said
and
nhs
sources
had
estimated
goods
from
europe
across
the
english
channel
could
be
reduced
to
between
and
of
current
daily
volumes
for
a
period
of
at
least
some
according
to
the
brexit
health
alliance
an
industry
body
million
patient
packs
go
to
the
eu
from
the
uk
every
month
and
million
packs
go
the
other
way
any
divergence
from
these
harmonized
standards
by
the
uk
in
the
future
and
a
lack
of
agreement
on
cooperation
with
the
eu
on
medicines
and
medical
devices
would
mean
that
supply
chains
are
at
risk
it
said
one
unintended
consequence
of
the
concern
is
that
patients
stocking
up
on
medicines
might
bring
about
problems
themselves
hospitals
pharmacies
family
doctor
surgeries
and
patients
should
not
stockpile
medicines
at
any
point
during
this
process
health
minister
hammond
said
doing
so
risks
shortages
for
other
patients
if
everyone
does
what
they
are
supposed
to
we
are
confident
the
supply
of
medicines
will
continue
uninterrupted
whatever
the
brexit
