in argentina crisis, firms do everything to cut costs - except fire workers
buenos
aires
reuters
like
many
argentine
businessmen
marco
meloni
is
doing
everything
he
can
to
avoid
laying
off
staff
at
his
textile
factory
despite
a
slump
in
sales
more
than
percent
interest
rates
and
soaring
utility
bills
the
reason
he
doesn
t
have
the
money
to
fire
anyone
a
and
unusual
feature
of
the
economic
crisis
gripping
latin
america
s
economy
is
the
absence
of
many
workers
losing
their
jobs
small
businesses
the
biggest
employer
in
argentina
have
been
hardest
hit
by
inflation
that
is
nearly
percent
a
tumbling
peso
and
major
cuts
to
subsidies
for
public
utilities
that
have
sharply
increased
companies
operating
costs
but
the
unemployment
rate
has
barely
budged
from
percent
reuters
interviews
with
business
owners
in
textile
plastic
clothing
and
paint
industries
government
officials
and
union
leaders
show
that
many
firms
are
adopting
different
strategies
to
try
to
survive
until
the
economy
begins
to
recover
which
the
international
monetary
fund
expects
to
begin
in
the
second
quarter
firms
are
reducing
working
hours
halting
production
on
some
days
cutting
shifts
and
making
workers
take
their
vacations
now
in
anticipation
of
more
customer
demand
once
the
economy
lifts
the
workforce
contracted
by
just
registered
workers
between
october
and
october
the
latest
government
data
reviewed
by
reuters
shows
that
represents
about
percent
of
the
labor
force
in
contrast
the
united
states
lost
about
percent
or
some
million
people
of
its
workforce
during
the
two
years
of
the
great
recession
as
companies
laid
off
workers
to
stay
afloat
argentina
has
some
of
the
world
s
most
generous
labor
laws
and
they
are
making
it
more
difficult
for
small
business
owners
like
meloni
to
adapt
to
an
economy
now
in
recession
typically
in
a
tough
economic
climate
a
company
might
be
expected
to
reduce
its
workforce
to
cut
costs
but
in
argentina
taking
that
step
could
dramatically
increase
costs
and
potentially
push
a
company
into
bankruptcy
introduced
by
successive
populist
peronist
governments
since
the
the
labor
laws
make
the
country
one
of
the
most
expensive
in
latin
america
to
employ
or
fire
a
worker
argentine
companies
are
required
to
pay
workers
laid
off
a
month
for
every
year
of
service
plus
at
least
one
additional
month
simply
for
informing
them
they
are
being
fired
and
crucially
there
is
no
cap
on
how
much
a
company
needs
to
pay
in
contrast
neighboring
chile
has
a
cap
on
severance
pay
layoff
costs
in
argentina
are
among
the
highest
in
the
world
according
to
the
world
bank
s
doing
business
project
which
measures
business
regulations
in
economies
the
argentine
labor
laws
have
helped
to
contain
what
could
have
been
a
big
increase
in
the
unemployment
rate
in
addition
president
mauricio
macri
a
free
marketer
who
wants
to
reform
the
country
s
rigid
labor
system
to
encourage
foreign
investment
is
taking
steps
to
dissuade
companies
from
firing
workers
he
announced
on
that
companies
must
give
days
notice
of
any
plans
to
lay
off
workers
so
that
the
government
can
help
find
ways
to
keep
them
employed
macri
wants
to
expand
an
existing
program
that
helps
to
subsidize
salaries
of
workers
at
companies
that
can
show
they
are
in
financial
straits
the
government
has
not
yet
issued
any
regulations
to
enforce
its
announcement
so
it
is
not
clear
whether
companies
are
informing
them
of
pending
dismissals
like
many
small
businessmen
meloni
has
found
himself
caught
in
a
vice
sales
from
his
plant
in
the
town
of
quilmes
km
miles
outside
the
capital
buenos
aires
shrank
by
just
over
one
third
last
year
as
argentina
s
economy
sank
deep
into
recession
it
was
not
a
storm
said
meloni
a
reference
to
how
the
country
s
president
has
described
the
economic
crisis
it
was
a
tsunami
the
tsunami
meloni
said
the
plant
which
makes
fabrics
used
to
operate
hours
a
day
from
monday
to
saturday
but
now
just
operates
hours
a
day
five
days
a
week
like
many
other
businesses
meloni
advanced
the
holidays
to
his
roughly
employees
with
the
hope
that
once
summer
ends
in
march
demand
will
pick
up
daniel
funes
de
rioja
the
head
of
one
of
argentina
s
biggest
labor
law
firms
said
a
major
issue
for
companies
was
the
seniority
of
many
workers
many
especially
in
industries
stay
in
the
same
job
for
years
so
paying
them
severance
becomes
very
expensive
there
s
a
cultural
custom
for
argentines
to
remain
in
their
jobs
but
also
as
it
has
been
always
very
expensive
to
fire
people
that
has
extended
the
length
of
service
of
the
workers
in
the
companies
explained
economist
camilo
tiscornia
from
buenos
c
t
consultancy
production
minister
dante
sica
said
companies
were
also
reluctant
to
fire
workers
because
of
forecasts
showing
an
economic
recovery
around
the
corner
they
prefer
to
suspend
and
not
fire
because
of
the
cost
of
layoffs
plus
the
cost
of
hiring
is
costly
sica
said
in
an
interview
the
unemployment
rate
in
argentina
fell
to
percent
in
the
third
quarter
from
percent
in
the
second
quarter
year
on
year
it
increased
only
basis
points
from
the
third
quarter
of
when
the
economy
was
growing
at
an
annual
rate
of
percent
while
workers
are
staying
in
their
jobs
they
are
earning
less
because
of
the
shorter
hours
and
fewer
shifts
some
have
resorted
to
taking
second
jobs
working
for
uber
the
ride
hailing
app
for
example
according
to
anecdotal
reports
we
are
not
happy
with
these
measures
at
all
fewer
shifts
shorter
hours
but
the
last
thing
we
want
is
layoffs
said
jose
minaberrigaray
head
of
setia
a
textile
workers
union
that
represents
workers
but
we
have
to
choose
what
is
bad
and
what
is
worse
he
told
reuters
macri
has
pushed
for
labor
reforms
to
make
it
easier
for
companies
to
hire
and
fire
but
his
government
has
delayed
implementing
them
after
protests
in
december
sica
the
production
minister
has
said
they
will
try
again
in
but
it
will
be
difficult
to
get
political
support
for
the
reforms
in
an
election
year
tiscornia
the
economist
said
the
difficulty
in
firing
workers
ultimately
hurt
the
competitiveness
of
argentine
companies
making
it
easier
to
fire
people
or
to
reduce
salaries
improves
the
economy
efficiency
and
the
companies
capacity
to
adjust
to
different
situations
he
said
in
the
it
s
tremendously
easy
to
fire
but
at
the
same
time
they
are
at
the
lowest
historic
jobless
rate
because
that
market
has
very
strong
flexibility
that
favors
the
creation
of
new
companies
here
if
you
start
a
business
and
it
doesn
t
work
you
are
stuck
with
the
employees
so
you
don
t
even
at
the
metallurgical
company
where
pablo
mansur
works
production
has
fallen
percent
over
the
last
months
to
keep
busy
workers
are
painting
cleaning
and
doing
repairs
mansur
said
workers
were
also
told
to
take
their
vacations
in
december
a
period
when
production
would
be
low
any
way
because
of
public
holidays
he
said
workers
agreed
to
this
because
we
are
aware
of
the
reality
it
is
not
a
whim
he
said
jorge
göttert
president
of
göttert
a
company
that
makes
production
line
systems
for
the
wood
and
auto
sectors
says
he
has
tried
not
to
lay
off
workers
because
of
his
memories
of
what
happened
during
the
country
s
worst
financial
crisis
in
then
the
company
laid
off
half
of
its
staff
to
try
to
survive
when
the
economy
rebounded
however
it
became
very
difficult
for
us
as
it
took
time
to
rebuild
its
workforce
training
new
workers
to
operate
the
specialized
machinery
we
think
this
crisis
will
be
shorter
