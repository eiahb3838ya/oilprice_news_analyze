siemens deal collapse fuels alstom-bombardier tie-up talk, shares rally
reuters
the
european
commission
s
decision
to
block
a
between
alstom
and
germany
s
siemens
is
fuelling
speculation
over
possible
merger
talks
between
the
french
rail
business
and
canada
s
bombardier
lifting
both
companies
shares
on
wednesday
eu
regulators
rejected
the
deal
saying
that
it
would
have
hurt
competition
and
led
to
higher
prices
for
consumers
despite
concessions
offered
by
the
companies
the
deal
s
collapse
helped
bombardier
avoid
the
creation
of
the
world
s
second
largest
rail
company
that
would
be
roughly
twice
its
size
it
also
gives
the
canadian
plane
and
train
maker
a
better
set
of
options
when
weighing
strategies
like
potential
mergers
said
altacorp
analyst
chris
murray
ultimately
the
need
to
consolidate
in
the
industry
has
not
gone
rail
companies
are
eyeing
consolidation
to
reduce
costs
through
scale
in
a
market
dominated
by
china
s
crrc
the
world
s
largest
train
maker
following
the
news
berenberg
analysts
upgraded
alstom
to
a
buy
rating
and
set
a
new
price
target
of
euros
noting
that
alstom
may
now
seek
an
alternative
deal
with
bombardier
s
transportation
division
we
believe
there
is
a
higher
chance
for
approval
than
the
due
to
lower
european
market
share
in
high
speed
rail
and
signalling
berenberg
said
in
a
note
to
clients
bombardier
aims
to
turn
its
transportation
unit
the
company
s
largest
division
by
revenues
into
a
billion
business
by
even
as
it
sheds
plane
programs
sources
including
french
officials
who
spoke
to
reuters
on
condition
of
anonymity
to
discuss
the
sensitive
matter
agreed
that
a
potential
merger
would
likely
face
less
resistance
from
regulators
but
one
noted
that
such
a
deal
could
require
divestitures
in
france
still
a
potential
merger
would
have
less
strategic
value
than
a
with
siemens
which
is
strong
in
signalling
assets
the
sources
said
bombardier
which
wants
to
grow
its
signalling
business
is
strong
in
rolling
stock
with
alstom
a
bit
in
between
the
french
officials
added
if
you
merge
alstom
with
bombardier
you
end
up
with
a
lot
of
iron
put
together
one
of
the
officials
said
bombardier
which
held
its
own
failed
merger
talks
with
siemens
in
would
not
specifically
discuss
future
prospects
or
say
how
the
collapse
of
the
impacts
the
company
we
will
keep
looking
at
opportunities
to
create
the
best
value
for
our
shareholders
bombardier
said
in
a
statement
an
alstom
spokesman
said
any
future
rail
consolidation
in
europe
would
be
examined
in
light
of
the
failed
if
the
rules
do
not
change
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
the
consolidation
of
our
sector
in
alstom

its
highest
