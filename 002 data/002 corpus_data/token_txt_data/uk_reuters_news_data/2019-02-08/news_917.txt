ship
s
engineer
charles
marlan
had
the
unsettling
sensation
his
vessel
was
being
sucked
out
to
sea
the
telltale
sign
of
an
imminent
tsunami
just
minutes
after
a
major
earthquake
struck
the
indonesian
island
of
sulawesi
on
friday
his
passenger
and
cargo
vessel
the
km
sabuk
nusantara
was
docked
in
wani
east
of
the
city
of
palu
which
suffered
the
brunt
of
the
disaster
the
whole
ship
was
shaking
everything
in
our
bunks
started
falling
marlan
said
the
ship
was
picked
up
by
the
tsunami
rushing
in
from
the
sea
and
slammed
onto
land
crashing
into
a
dockside
settlement
and
that
s
where
it
lies
high
and
dry
nearly
a
week
after
the
earthquake
and
tsunami
devastated
the
area
killing
at
least
people
marlan
and
his
fellow
crewmen
knew
they
were
in
trouble
when
they
felt
the
ship
being
pulled
back
out
to
sea
from
the
dock
as
the
sea
receded
heralding
the
arrival
of
a
tsunami
they
had
no
sooner
scrambled
into
life
jackets
when
a
wave
bore
down
on
them
i
could
hear
the
waves
coming
marlan
said
describing
how
he
was
gripped
by
fear
the
waves
carried
us
very
fast
and
before
we
knew
it
we
were
sitting
on
land
he
said
in
an
interview
aboard
the
ship
which
sits
balanced
precariously
its
propeller
and
rudder
exposed
hanging
dusty
metres
above
the
ground
no
one
on
the
boat
was
hurt
now
marlan
and
crewmen
are
stranded
awaiting
a
decision
on
what
should
be
done
from
the
national
ferry
operator
which
owns
the
vessel
they
survive
on
handouts
from
passing
ferries
and
while
away
the
time
attending
a
every
now
and
then
and
chatting
with
neighbourhood
kids
who
climb
up
on
board
marlan
said
he
was
thankful
his
ship
had
not
killed
anyone
when
it
was
hurled
onto
the
land
as
far
as
they
knew
what
is
important
is
we
are
alive
and
for
that
we
should
