the

had
shown
a
tolerance
of
since
corbyn
was
elected
leader
of
the
party
in
it
said
their
response
was
needed
because
of
the
existential
threat
to
jewish
life
in
this
country
that
would
be
posed
by
a
jeremy
government
the
party
that
was
until
recently
the
natural
home
for
our
community
has
seen
its
values
and
integrity
eroded
by
corbynite
contempt
for
jews
and
israel
the
editorial
said
a
labour
spokesman
said
the
party
recognised
the
concerns
raised
by
the
jewish
community
and
acknowledged
there
was
a
huge
amount
of
work
to
do
to
build
trust
and
confidence
the
next
labour
government
poses
no
threat
of
any
kind
whatsoever
to
jewish
people
the
spokesman
said
the
security
and
wellbeing
of
jewish
people
is
a
priority
for
our
party
and
in
government
we
will
always
ensure
schools
synagogues
and
institutions
are
properly
labour
is
benefiting
from
turmoil
in
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
conservatives
over
brexit
and
has
taken
the
lead
in
some
opinion
polls
while
an
election
need
not
be
held
for
another
four
years
the
wrangling
over
britain
s
divorce
from
the
european
union
has
raised
the
possibility
of
a
vote
much
sooner
as
may
struggles
to
keep
her
government
together
but
labour
has
been
wrestling
with
accusations
that
it
has
been
tolerant
of
among
some
of
its
members
and
in
april
leaders
of
britain
s
jews
organised
a
protest
accusing
corbyn
of
failing
to
address
their
concerns
with
the
government
in
brexit
disarray
there
is
a
clear
and
present
danger
that
a
man
with
a
default
blindness
to
the
jewish
community
s
fears
a
man
who
has
a
problem
seeing
that
hateful
rhetoric
aimed
at
israel
can
easily
step
into
could
be
our
next
prime
minister
the
newspapers
wrote
corbyn
has
previously
apologised
for
what
he
called
pockets
of
in
the
party
and
promised
to
stamp
them
out
he
has
responded
to
protests
by
meeting
with
jewish
community
leaders
reassuring
jews
they
are
welcome
in
the
party
the
latest
flashpoint
was
the
party
s
decision
to
approve
a
new
code
of
conduct
which
jewish
groups
said
internationally
accepted
definition
of
labour
said
it
had
concerns
about
