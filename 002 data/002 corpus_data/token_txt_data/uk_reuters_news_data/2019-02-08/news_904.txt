the

said
in
a
statement
this
is
the
first
time
we
have
encountered
this
situation
in
hong
kong
we
have
not
been
given
a
reason
for
the
rejection
it
said
mallet
who
is
the
fcc
s
did
not
respond
immediately
to
a
request
for
comment
while
hong
kong
s
immigration
department
said
it
did
not
comment
on
specific
cases
in
august
mallet
who
was
the
fcc
s
acting
president
at
the
time
hosted
a
speech
by
activist
andy
chan
in
a
move
strongly
condemned
by
china
s
foreign
ministry
the
ministry
had
urged
the
fcc
to
withdraw
its
invitation
to
chan
a
founder
of
the
hong
kong
national
party
which
was
formally
banned
by
hong
kong
authorities
last
month
authorities
in
beijing
and
hong
kong
have
said
the
notion
of
independence
is
inconsistent
with
the
principle
of
one
country
two
systems
under
which
the
territory
has
been
governed
since
britain
handed
it
back
to
china
in
the
principle
promises
hong
kong
a
high
degree
of
autonomy
and
freedoms
not
enjoyed
elsewhere
in
china
rights
which
are
enshrined
in
a
known
as
the
basic
law
mallet
said
in
august
the
fcc
neither
endorsed
nor
opposed
the
diverse
views
of
its
speakers
fully
respected
the
law
and
championed
free
speech
and
freedom
the
fcc
said
it
was
expecting
a
full
explanation
from
the
hong
kong
authorities
in
the
absence
of
any
reasonable
explanation
the
fcc
calls
on
the
hong
kong
authorities
to
rescind
their
decision
the
club
said
in
a
statement
late
on
friday
describing
the
move
as
extremely
rare
if
not
unprecedented
reuters
received
multiple
messages
via
email
and
social
media
from
foreign
banking
and
legal
professionals
expressing
shock
at
the
decision
a
spokesman
for
the
consulate
general
described
the
rejection
as
deeply
troubling
this
decision
is
especially
disturbing
because
it
mirrors
problems
faced
by
international
journalists
in
the
mainland
and
appears
inconsistent
with
the
principles
enshrined
in
the
basic
law
he
said
reporters
without
borders
called
on
hong
kong
authorities
to
reverse
their
decision
this
is
clearly
a
form
of
retaliation
for
his
involvement
in
the
public
talk
organised
in
august
by
fcchk
which
angered
beijing
by
featuring
a
kong
independence
activist
the
group
said
in
a
statement
such
action
is
yet
another
proof
that
the
chinese
authorities
are
extending
their
policy
of
intimidating
foreign
journalists
to
the
territory
of
hong
kong
it
said
the
hong
kong
journalists
association
hkja
said
it
was
shocked
at
the
move
and
urged
the
government
to
reconsider
and
explain
its
decision
if
left
unexplained
it
will
give
rise
to
worries
that
it
is
an
act
of
reprisal
against
mr
mallet
further
undermining
public
confidence
in
freedom
of
speech
and
the
press
the
hkja
said
lawmakers
from
hong
kong
s
democratic
opposition
called
for
mallet
s
visa
to
be
reissued
it
is
sending
a
very
wrong
message
to
the
international
community
that
hong
kong
is
just
another
city
in
mainland
china
veteran
democrat
party
legislator
james
to
told
reporters
some
politicians
backed
the
government
s
move
however
saying
strong
messages
had
to
be
sent
that
hong
kong
had
zero
tolerance

rights
watch
said
in
a
statement
the
visa
rejection
together
with
the
unprecedented
banning
of
the
hong
kong
national
party
showed
a
quickening
downward
spiral
for
human
rights
in
hong
kong
this
is
shocking
and
unprecedented
it
said
the
hong
kong
authorities
visa
renewal
rejection
without
explanation
of
a
journalist
who
s
done
nothing
more
than
his
job
smacks
of
persecution
of
the
fcc
whose
members
include
senior
lawyers
scholars
and
government
officials
besides
journalists
has
long
portrayed
itself
as
fostering
and
defending
