year
s

signalling
that
she
could
break
with
her
mentor
angela
merkel
s
liberal
approach
the
conservative
party
elected
annegret

as
their
leader
on

making
her
frontrunner
to
become
the
next
chancellor
of
germany
which

europe
s
biggest
economy
however
the
narrow
win
over
the
more
conservative
friedrich
merz
exposed
splits
in
germany
s
biggest
party
which
she
must
try
to
close
before
next
may
s
vote
for
the
european
parliament
and
four
state
elections
in
one
of
the

convene
a
workshop
discussion
on
migration
and
security
with
experts
and
critics
of
migrant
and
refugee
policies
to
work
on
concrete
improvements
told
bild
am
sonntag
weekly
our
programme
for
the
european
election
will
build
on
these
merkel
s
approach
eroded
her
popularity
and
led
to
losses
in
regional
elections
culminating
in
her
october
decision
to
stand
down
as
party
leader
she
aims
to
stay
on
as
chancellor
until
the
next
federal
vote
in
by
voting
for
the
cdu
chose
continuity
but
the
new
leader
told
german
television
this
did
not
exclude
some
changes
you
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
your
predecessor
what
is
good
is
continued
and
where
there
is
room
to
change
things
we
will
make
changes
she
told
broadcaster
ard
while
was
less
critical
of
merkel
s
migrant
policy
than
her
rivals
in
the
leadership
contest
she
has
argued
that
migrants
must
learn
german
and
those
with
a
criminal
record
can
not
stay
but
most
of
all
she
has
stressed
that
the
cdu
must
not
dwell
too
long
on
the
damaging
issue
one
of
her
main
tasks
in
elections
next
year
in
three
eastern
states
will
be
to
win
back
voters
who
have
turned
to
the
alternative
for
germany
afd
which
has
capitalised
on
fears
about
the
integration
of
migrants
now
represented
in
all
federal
states
and
polling
at
around
percent
it
is
the
main
opposition
in
parliament
to
merkel
s
grand
coalition
of
the
cdu
its
conservative
bavarian
allies
and
the
social
democrats
spd
an
emnid
poll
on
sunday
put
the
conservative
bloc
on
percent
up
point
from
last
week
but
down
from
percent
in
last
year
s
election
its
lowest
result
since
the
spd
has
slumped
to
percent
from
percent
in
the
election
former
spd
chancellor
gerhard
schroeder
told
handelsblatt
the
cdu
had
made
a
mistake
with
its
choice
merz
would
have
been
the
chance
to
set
the
two
main
parties
further
apart
from
each
other
so
the
fringes
on
the
left
and
right
would
get
weaker
that
is
not
just
important
for
the
cdu
and
spd
but
for
all
germany
