european cohesion, multilateral order under threat - merkel
berlin
reuters
nationalism
and
a
attitude
are
undermining
the
cohesion
of
europe
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
on
thursday
two
days
after
president
donald
trump
rejected
globalism
and
touted
america
first
in
a
united
nations
speech
without
naming
trump
or
his
nationalist
protectionist
approach
merkel
told
fellow
conservatives
at
an
event
of
the
konrad
adenauer
foundation
in
berlin
that
the
european
union
and
germany
were
facing
a
watershed
moment
trump
has
threatened
to
pull
the
united
states
out
of
the
world
trade
organisation
wto
potentially
undermining
one
of
the
foundations
of
the
modern
global
economy
which
washington
was
instrumental
in
creating
the
has
also
questioned
the
value
of
the
nato
alliance
the
centrepiece
of
transatlantic
security
cooperation
for
almost
seven
decades
perhaps
the
most
threatening
development
for
me
is
that
multilateralism
has
come
under
such
pressure
merkel
said
europe
is
facing
attacks
from
the
outside
and
from
the
merkel
who
grew
up
in
old
communist
east
germany
called
the
end
of
the
cold
war
illusory
saying
she
never
would
have
expected
the
world
would
face
a
similar
ideological
clash
between
different
schools
of
thought
again
i
did
not
expect
to
have
conflicts
of
different
systems
again
as
we
have
today
with
china
but
also
in
dealing
with
data
and
certainly
also
with
the
united
states
of
america
merkel
said
the
changing
political
landscape
and
shifting
international
order
she
said
make
it
necessary
again
to
emphasize
supposedly
achievements
such
as
tolerance
and
the
art
of
striving
for
political
compromises
it
s
a
time
of
decisions
where
supposedly
obvious
things
call
for
a
standpoint
said
merkel
adding
that
outcomes
could
hardly
be
achieved
if
some
were
approaching
the
resolution
of
disputes
with
a
attitude
where
compromises
are
scorned
democracy
is
in
danger
merkel
said
against
a
backdrop
of
rising
tensions
within
both
her
governing
coalition
and
european
union
member
states
it
was
the
supreme
discipline
of
democracy
she
said
to
find
a
balance
between
different
interests
pointing
to
the
increased
use
of
social
media
platforms
by
some
politicians
merkel
warned
of
producing
spirals
of
outrage
the
exchange
of
differing
views
was
vital
for
democracy
as
was
the
need
to
avoid
simplification
her
warning
followed
a
report
by
germany
s
leading
economic
institutes
who
said
on
thursday
that
any
escalation
of
trade
friction
involving
the
united
states
could
cause
a
major
recession
in
germany
and
europe
trump
s
speech
to
the
general
assembly
on
tuesday
was
a
thunderous
recitation
of
his
america
first
policies
he
has
disrupted
the
world
order
by
withdrawing
the
united
states
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
paris
climate
accord
and
threatened
to
punish
nato
nations
for
not
paying
more
for
their
common
defence
