nayabans
isn
t
remarkable
as
northern
indian
villages
go
sugar
cane
grows
in
surrounding
fields
women
carry
animal
feed
in
bullock
carts
through
narrow
lanes
people
chatter
outside
a
store
and
cows
loiter
but
this
week
the
village
in
uttar
pradesh
state
became
a
symbol
of
the
deepening
communal
divide
in
india
as
some
hindu
men
from
the
area
complained
they
had
seen
a
group
of
muslims
slaughtering
cows
in
a
mango
orchard
a
couple
of
miles
away
that
infuriated
hindus
who
regard
the
cow
as
a
sacred
animal
anger
against
muslims
turned
into
outrage
that
police
had
not
stopped
an
illegal
practise
and
a
hindu
mob
blocked
a
highway
threw
stones
burned
vehicles
and
eventually
two
people
were
shot
and
killed
including
a
police
officer
the
events
throw
a
spotlight
on
the
religious
strains
in
places
like
nayabans
since
prime
minister
narendra
modi
s
hindu
nationalist
bharatiya
janata
party
bjp
came
to
power
at
the
national
level
in
and
in
uttar
pradesh
in
tensions
are
ratcheting
up
ahead
of
the
next
general
election
due
to
be
held
by
may
the
bjp
said
it
was
bizarre
to
assume
the
party
would
benefit
from
any
religious
disharmony
dismissing
suggestions
that
its
supporters
were
largely
responsible
for
the
tensions
in
a
large
country
like
india
nobody
can
ensure
that
nothing
will
go
wrong
but
it
s
our
responsibility
to
maintain
law
and
order
and
we
understand
that
party
spokesman
gopal
krishna
agarwal
said
but
people
are
trying
to
politicize
these
nayabans
just
about
three
hour
s
drive
from
delhi
has
about
muslims
out
of
a
population
of
the
rest
are
hindu
relations
between
the
communities
began
deteriorating
around
the
muslim
holy
month
of
ramadan
last
year
when
hindus
in
the
village
demanded
that
loudspeakers
used
to
call
for
prayer
at
a
makeshift
mosque
be
removed
local
muslims
said
for
years
mikes
were
used
in
the
mosque
calls
for
prayer
were
made
five
times
a
day
but
no
one
objected
said
waseem
khan
a
muslim
community
leader
in
nayabans
we
resisted
initially
but
then
we
thought
it
s
better
to
live
in
peace
then
create
a
dispute
over
a
mike
he
said
we
don
t
want
to
give
them
a
chance
to
fan
communal
reuters
spoke
with
more
than
a
dozen
muslims
from
the
village
but
except
for
khan
no
one
else
wanted
to
be
named
for
fear
of
angering
the
hindu
population
several
among
a
group
of
muslim
women
and
girls
standing
outside
the
mosque
said
they
have
been
living
in
fear
since
the
bjp
came
to
power
in
the
state
in
they
said
that
hindu
groups
now
hold
provocative
processions
through
the
village
during
every
hindu
festival
loudspeakers
blaring
something
that
used
to
happen
rarely
before
they
said
they
felt
terrorised
by
hindu
activists
while
passing
through
our
areas
during
their
religious
rallies
they
chant
pakistan
murdabad
down
with
pakistan
as
if
we
have
some
connection
to
pakistan
just
because
we
are
muslims
khan
said
the
subcontinent
was
divided
into
muslim
pakistan
and
india
at
the
time
of
independence
from
british
colonial
rule
in
during
the
violence
on
monday
many
muslims
in
nayabans
locked
themselves
in
their
homes
fearing
attacks
some
who
had
attended
a
muslim
religious
congregation
some
miles
away
stayed
outside
the
area
that
night
to
avoid
making
themselves
targets
for
the
mob
muslim
villagers
say
they
are
particularly
fearful
of
the
top
elected
official
in
uttar
pradesh
chief
minister
yogi
adityanath
who
is
a
hindu
priest
and
senior
bjp
figure
hindu
hardliners
started
asserting
themselves
more
in
the
village
after
he
was
elected
they
say
uttar
pradesh
sends
lawmakers
to
the
lower
house
of
parliament
the
largest
of
any
state
in
the
country
considered
the
county
s
political
crucible
it
has
also
been
the
scene
for
spiralling
tensions
adityanath
said
the
lead
up
to
the
rioting
in
nayabans
was
a
big
conspiracy
but
did
not
elaborate
in
the
only
statement
from
his
office
on
the
incident
adityanath
ordered
police
to
arrest
those
directly
or
indirectly
involved
in
the
slaughter
of
cows
and
made
no
mention
of
the
death
of
the
police
inspector
he
announced
million
rupees
as
compensation
for
the
family
of
the
other
dead
man
a
local
who
is
among
those
accused
by
police
for
the
violence
both
men
were
hindus
and
died
of
bullet
wounds
although
police
said
it
was
not
yet
clear
who
shot
whom
police
say
they
have
arrested
up
to
five
people
for
the
cow
slaughter
but
have
not
given
their
religion
locals
say
all
the
arrested
people
are
muslims
at
least
five
hindu
men
including
an
soldier
who
was
home
during
the
violence
have
been
arrested
for
the
unrest
leading
to
the
deaths
all
invidious
elements
who
may
have
conspired
to
vitiate
the
situation
will
be
exposed
through
a
fair
and
transparent
investigation
anand
kumar
the
second
highest
police
official
in
uttar
pradesh
told
reuters
asked
if
there
was
any
bias
against
muslims
uttar
pradesh
government
spokesman
sidharth
nath
singh
who
is
also
the
state
s
health
minister
told
reuters
we
believe
in
equality
and
our
motto
is
sabka
saath
sabka
vikas
using
a
hindi
phrase
often
used
by
modi
that
means
collective
effort
inclusive
growth
the
two
communities
in
nayabans
have
lived
in
relative
harmony
for
years
residents
from
both
groups
said
but
now
hindus
in
the
village
who
mostly
say
they
support
yogi
accuse
the
muslims
of
trying
to
turn
themselves
into
the
victims
when
they
weren
t
can
t
believe
they
are
raising
our
processions
with
journalists
said
daulat
a
hindu
daily
wage
labourer
who
goes
by
one
name
they
are
making
it
a
issue
we
are
not
their
people
have
been
accused
of
killing
cows
so
they
are
playing
the
at
a
middle
school
metres
from
the
police
outpost
near
where
the
two
men
got
killed
two
women
teachers
sitting
on
a
veranda
soaking
in
the
winter
sun
said
its
students
stopped
coming
for
classes
in
the
first
few
days
after
the
violence
we
worship
cows
and
their
slaughter
can
t
be
accepted
said
one
of
the
teachers
uma
rani
two
hindus
died
here
but
nothing
happened
to
the
cow
both
teachers
were
hindus
political
analysts
say
relations
between
the
two
communities
are
likely
to
stay
tense
ahead
of
the
national
vote
particularly
in
polarised
states
such
as
uttar
pradesh
the
bjp
made
a
sweep
in
uttar
pradesh
in
helping
modi
win
the
country
s
biggest
parliamentary
mandate
in
three
decades
but
pollsters
predict
a
tighter
contest
next
year
because
of
a
lack
of
jobs
and
low
farm
prices
facing
economic
headwinds
and
lacklustre
job
growth
modi
will
rally
his
conservative
base
by
selectively
resorting
to
hindu
nationalism
global
security
consultancy
stratfor
said
last
month
on
sunday
more
than
hindu
monks
and
activists
close
to
the
bjp
held
a
rally
in
delhi
demanding
legislation
for
the
construction
of
a
hindu
temple
on
the
site
of
a
century
mosque
that
was
pulled
down
in
sparking
riots
across
the
country
that
killed
about
people
many
hindus
believe
the
mosque
was
built
by
a
muslim
chieftain
over
the
birthplace
of
hindu
ram
muslims
say
they
increasingly
feel
like
citizens
in
their
own
country
the
bjp
will
definitely
benefit
from
such
incidents
said
tahir
saifi
a
muslim
community
leader
a
few
miles
from
the
area
of
violence
who
supports
a
regional
opposition
party
in
uttar
pradesh
they
want
all
hindus
to
unite
and
when
religion
comes
into
the
picture
other
issues
like
development
take
a
back
