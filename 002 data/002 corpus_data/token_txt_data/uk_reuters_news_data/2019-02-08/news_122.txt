widely
credited
with
helping
push
support
for
secession
to
record
levels
told
reporters
outside
edinburgh
sheriff
court
following
a
hearing
which
media
and
public
were
not
allowed
to
attend
i
refute
absolutely
these
allegations
of
criminality
and
i
will
defend
myself
to
the
utmost
in

he
added
i
would
love
to
say
a
great
deal
more
but
i
ve
got
to
observe
the
rules
of
the
court
and
in
court
is
where
i
will
state
my
salmond
was
released
on
bail
and
it
was
not
disclosed
when
further
hearings
would
take
place
the
combative
politician
led
the
devolved
scottish
government
for
seven
years
until
as
leader
of
the
scottish
national
party
snp
he
helped
drive
growing
support
for
scottish
independence
but
scotland
ultimately
voted
to
stay
part
of
the
united
kingdom
in
a
referendum
last
year
salmond
took
legal
action
against
the
scottish
devolved
government
now
led
by
his
successor
and
protege
nicola
sturgeon
over
how
it
handled
a
complaints
process
against
him
in
a
sexual
harassment
case
salmond
who
denied
any
wrongdoing
won
a
judicial
review
earlier
this
month
on
how
that
case
was
handled
by
the
scottish
government
when
it
conceded
it
had
acted
unlawfully
in
probing
the
harassment
claims
the
case
pitted
the
two
most
popular
figures
in
the
scottish
independence
movement
against
one
another
and
some
commentators
believe
it
could
weaken
sturgeon
s
leadership
just
as
she
seeks
to
start
a
new
drive
for
secession
amid
the
chaos
of
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
a
dispute
has
continued
to
simmer
between
two
factions
in
the
snp
around
what
sturgeon
knew
about
the
case
and
when
an
inquiry
by
the
scottish
parliament
is
under
way
to
discover
more
sturgeon
said
the
news
of
salmond
s
charges
would
come
as
a
shock
to
many
but
that
tight
judicial
requirements
and
the
sensitivity
of
the
case
meant
she
could
not
comment
