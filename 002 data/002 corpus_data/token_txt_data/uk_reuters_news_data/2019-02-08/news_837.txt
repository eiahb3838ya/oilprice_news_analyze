s
biggest
software
company
died
on
monday
at
the
age
of
his
family
said
allen
left
microsoft
in
before
the
company
became
a
corporate
juggernaut
following
a
dispute
with
gates
but
his
share
of
their
original
partnership
allowed
him
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
and
billions
of
dollars
on
yachts
art
rock
music
sports
teams
brain
research

in
the
early
before
leaving
microsoft
allen
had
a
list
of
friends
in

but
preferred
to
avoid
the
limelight
at
his
compound
on
mercer
island
across
lake
washington
from
seattle
where
he
grew
up
allen
remained
loyal
to
the
pacific
northwest
region
directing
more
than
billion
to
mostly
local
philanthropic
projects
developing
seattle
s
south
lake
union
tech
hub
that
inc
calls
home
and
building
the
headquarters
of
his

institute
for
brain
science
there
gates
described
allen
as
following
the
microsoft
partnership
with
a
second
act
focused
on
strengthening
communities
and
in
a
statement
said
i
am
heartbroken
by
the
passing
of
one
of
my
oldest
and
dearest
current
microsoft
chief
executive
satya
nadella
on
monday
called
him
a
quiet
and
persistent
man
who
changed
the
world
he
is
in
seattle
said
david
brewster
founder
of
local
news
website
and
the
seattle
weekly
newspaper
he
s
remote
and
reclusive
there
s
too
much
howard
hughes
in
the
way
he
behaves
for
seattle
truly
to
appreciate
a
lot
of
the
good
that
he
paul
gardner
allen
was
born
in
seattle
on
the
son
of
a
librarian
father
and
teacher
mother
he
was
two
years
older
than
gates
but
when
they
met
in
the
computer
room
at
the
exclusive
lakeside
school
in
seattle
in
they
discovered
a
shared
passion
in
those
days
we
were
just
goofing
around
or
so
we
thought
gates
recalled
in
his
book
road
allen
went
on
to
washington
state
university
but
dropped
out
in
to
take
a
job
with
honeywell
in
boston
while
there
he
pestered
gates
who
was
studying
at
nearby
harvard
to
quit
school
and
join
the
nascent
revolution
in
personal
computing
gates
finally
agreed
and
in
the
two
jointly
developed
basic
software
for
the
altair
a
clunky
desktop
computer
that
cost
in
kit
form
the
pair
moved
to
albuquerque
new
mexico
close
to
the
altair
s
maker
and
formed
a
company
it
was
allen
s
idea
to
call
it
an
amalgam
of
microcomputer
and
software
the
hyphen
was
later
dropped
allen
was
in
charge
of
microsoft
s
technical
operations
for
the
company
s
first
eight
years
making
him
one
of
the
handful
of
people
who
created
early
software
such
as
and
word
that
enabled
the
pc
revolution
and
thrust
microsoft
to
the
top
but
he
had
ceased
to
be
on
the
cutting
edge
of
software
development
by
the
early
he
never
displayed
the
commercial
instinct
of
gates
who
generally
is
credited
with
powering
microsoft
s
rise
to
ubiquity
in
the
allen
left
microsoft
in
after
falling
out
with
gates
and
his
new
lieutenant
steve
ballmer
in
december
only
months
after
being
diagnosed
with
hodgkin
s
lymphoma
as
he
recalled
in
his
memoir
idea
man
he
overheard
gates
and
ballmer
secretly
plotting
to
reduce
his
ownership
stake
they
were
bemoaning
my
recent
lack
of
production
and
discussing
how
they
might
dilute
my
microsoft
equity
by
issuing
options
to
themselves
and
other
shareholders
allen
wrote
gates
and
ballmer
later
apologized
but
the
damage
was
done
and
allen
left
microsoft
although
he
remained
on
the
board
until
allen
recovered
from
his
cancer
after
radiation
treatment
but
in
was
diagnosed
with
s
lymphoma
another
form
of
blood
cancer
he
went
into
remission
in
april
but
the
disease
resurfaced
in
allen
held
onto
his
share
of
the
company
his
percent
stake
at
microsoft
s
initial
public
offering
in
instantly
made
him
a
his
wealth
peaked
at
about
billion
in
late
according
to
forbes
magazine
but
allen
was
hurt
by
the
sharp
decline
in
microsoft
stock
after
the
bubble
burst
in
and
some
unprofitable
technology
investments
in
october
forbes
magazine
estimated
his
wealth
at
billion
and
said
he
was
the
richest
person
in
the
world
allen
the
owner
of
patents
liked
to
cast
himself
as
a
technology
visionary
who
drove
microsoft
s
early
success
and
saw
the
future
of
connected
computing
long
before
the
internet
i
expect
the
personal
computer
to
become
the
kind
of
thing
that
people
carry
with
them
a
companion
that
takes
notes
does
accounting
gives
reminders
handles
a
thousand
personal
tasks
allen
wrote
in
a
column
in
personal
computing
magazine
as
far
back
as
long
before
portable
computers
became
a
reality
in
the
same
year
he
outlined
an
early
vision
of
what
turned
out
to
be
the
internet
to
microcomputer
interface
magazine
what
i
do
see
is
a
home
terminal
that
s
connected
to
a
centralized
network
by
phone
lines
fiber
optics
or
some
other
communication
system
he
said
with
that
system
you
can
perhaps
put
your
car
up
for
sale
or
look
for
a
house
in
a
different
city
or
check
out
the
price
of
asparagus
at
the
nearest
grocery
market
or
check
the
price
of
a
allen
later
called
this
sweeping
idea
the
wired
world
which
has
broadly
come
to
fruition
he
was
not
alone
in
predicting
connected
computing
but
was
one
of
the
most
prominent
yet
allen
s
technology
ventures
after
microsoft
which
focused
on
areas
he
thought
would
grow
with
the
advent
of
the
wired
world
were
not
as
successful
he
lost
billion
in
the
cable
television
industry
chiefly
with
a
bad
bet
on
cable
company
charter
communications
while
technology
ventures
he
bankrolled
such
as
metricom
skypix
and
interval
research
were
costly
failures
he
had
better
luck
in
sports
and
real
estate
allen
bought
the
portland
trail
blazers
basketball
team
in
and
became
a
local
hero
in
when
he
purchased
the
seattle
seahawks
football
franchise
after
the
previous
owner
had
tried
to
move
the
team
to
california
the
seahawks
won
the
super
bowl
in
february
and
both
franchises
are
now
valued
at
many
times
what
allen
paid
for
them
allen
also
made
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
redeveloping
south
lake
union
a
shabby
area
of
downtown
seattle
that
became
a
gleaming
technology
mecca
and
site
of
s
glass
spheres
headquarters
all
the
while
the
allen
pursued
myriad
personal
projects
and
pastimes
he
owned
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
yachts
the
meters
octopus
which
was
the
venue
for
many
lavish
parties
and
the
base
for
scuba
expeditions
a
rock
n
roll
aficionado
allen
had
a
band
on
call
to
jam
with
when
he
wanted
and
spent
more
than
million
building
a
museum
devoted
to
his
hero
jimi
hendrix
which
morphed
into
a
music
and
science
fiction
exhibit
designed
by
frank
gehry
he
spent
millions
more
on
a
collection
of
vintage
warplanes
and
funded
the
first
rocket
to
make
it
into
space
he
also
collected
priceless
antiquities
and
works
by
monet
rodin
and
rothko
to
put
in
his
extensive
art
collection
like
gates
allen
was
a
dedicated
philanthropist
giving
away
more
than
billion
in
his
lifetime
and
pledging
to
donate
more
than
half
his
wealth
to
charity
through
various
vehicles
allen
focused
his
giving
on
brain
science
motivated
by
the
loss
of
his
mother
to
alzheimer
s
disease

with
universities
and
libraries
