court battle, trade war and 5g spell tough 2019 for apple in china
francisco
reuters
apple
inc
s
chief
executive
tim
cook
has
his
work
cut
out
in
china
this
year
the
iphone
maker
faces
the
looming
threat
of
a
sales
ban
the
uncertain
outcome
of
trade
war
talks
and
the
of
a
new
network
where
it
finds
itself
behind
rivals
like
huawei
and
samsung
the
complex
outlook
raises
a
challenge
for
apple
as
it
looks
to
revive
its
china
fortunes
after
weakness
there
sparked
a
rare
drop
in
its
global
sales
forecast
knocked
billion
from
its
market
valuation
and
roiled
global
markets
cook
told
investors
that
the
main
drag
on
the
firm
s
performance
in
china
had
been
a
slowdown
in
the
country
s
economy
exacerbated
by
the
impact
of
trade
tensions
between
washington
and
beijing
we
did
not
foresee
the
magnitude
of
the
economic
deceleration
particularly
in
greater
china
he
said
chinese
shoppers
told
reuters
another
element
had
been
key
the
high
on
apple
s
flagship
phones
analysts
said
the
firm
faced
a
brewing
storm
of
challenges
an
economic
slowdown
stronger
rivals
like
huawei
technologies
co
ltd
bringing
out
comparable
tech
at
lower
prices
and
bubbling
patriotic
sentiment
amid
the
trade
war
a
chinese
court
has
also
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
banning
some
apple
phones
part
of
a
legal
battle
with
chip
maker
qualcomm
inc
this
ban
potentially
hitting
iphone
models
from
the
through
the
x
has
yet
to
be
enforced
on
thursday
a
local
industry
body
the
china
and
innovation
strategic
alliance
called
on
apple
to
heed
the
court
order
and
not
trample
the
chinese
law
by
leveraging
its
super
economic
power
and
apple
declined
to
comment
on
the
group
s
statement
but
has
previously
said
it
believes
its
current
phones
comply
with
the
chinese
court
s
order
these
are
tough
times
for
apple
in
china
said
neil
shah
research
director
at
counterpoint
adding
the
iphone
could
see
its
market
share
slip
to
percent
this
year
in
the
face
of
stronger
local
rivals
and
worry
about
the
sales
ban
apple
s
market
share
in
the
of
was
around
percent
and
has
dipped
from
above
percent
in
overtaken
by
local
rivals
like
huawei
oppo
and
vivo
apple
vs
huawei
another
question
mark
for
apple
is
its
strategy
in
china
where
the
firm
is
not
expected
to
have
a
phone
until
behind
rivals
like
huawei
xiaomi
corp
and
samsung
electronics
china
is
looking
to
push
ahead
with
its
rollout
of
a
faster
network
with
a
phase
this
year
and
a
commercial
network
in
some
are
looking
to
make
an
early
bet
on
the
technology
huawei
is
planning
a
phone
while
xiaomi
is
aiming
for
the
third
quarter
samsung
is
expected
to
unveil
a
phone
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
industry
insiders
however
said
apple
would
likely
hold
off
until
the
fall
of
to
have
its
own
phone
a
strategy
that
would
bypass
the
untested
early
period
of
the
technology
but
which
could
mean
chinese
shoppers
delay
iphone
purchases
or
buy
another
brand
that
switched
to
earlier
i
ll
definitely
be
paying
attention
to
functionality
when
i
buy
my
next
phone
said
wu
chengjun
a
graduate
student
in
beijing
who
currently
uses
an
iphone
x
with
the
exception
of
huawei
which
makes
it
own
chips
qualcomm
is
providing
the
technology
to
many
of
the
major
phone
makers
releasing
handsets
this
year
if
you
re
a
phone
maker
looking
for
a
super
cycle
of
sales
if
you
don
t
have
your
situation
won
t
get
any
better
cristiano
amon
qualcomm
s
president
told
reuters
in
an
interview
the
carrier
channel
is
going
to
be
incentivized
to
start
selling
phones
in
the
second
half
of
he
said
but
there
are
risks
integrating
too
early
into
smart
phones
because
the
technology
requires
deeply
the
devices
with
multiple
new
antennas
given
spotty
coverage
in
gambling
on
a
new
design
before
networks
are
mature
could
be
more
risk
than
reward
said
darryn
lowe
a
bain
co
partner
who
works
with
the
wireless
industry
when
you
think
about
it
s
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
complicated
than
an
aluminum
strip
running
around
the
phone
he
said
and
other
shoppers
and
analysts
said
apple
s
more
cautious
approach
to
made
sense
and
that
the
firm
would
not
likely
lose
out
too
much
to
rivals
by
delaying
its
launch
apple
s
decision
to
wait
to
adopt
until
after
other
makers
didn
t
hurt
it
but
that
was
when
consumers
commonly
purchased
a
phone
every
two
years
a
cycle
that
has
elongated
and
might
prompt
buyers
to
want
a
more
future
proof

said
glenn
lurie
ceo
of
synchronoss
technologies
and
the
former
head
of
at
t
s
wireless
unit
if
you
re
going
to
walk
in
to
make
a
decision
the
concept
that
i
ve
already
got
built
in
it
feels
pretty
good
lurie
said
but
buyers
such
as
li
hongzhuo
a
student
in
beijing
said
he
was
interested
in
but
it
wouldn
t
be
the
deciding
factor
and
he
preferred
to
wait
until
the
technology
was
tried
and
tested
typically
my
needs
for
my
phone
are
high
speeds
for
downloading
videos
or
transferring
files
from
chat
apps
this
will
get
faster
with
but
already
satisfies
my
needs
said
li
i
won
t
really
consider
switching
my
phone
until
has
been
operating
stably
on
the
market
for
some
time
without
any
bugs
or
unless
they
