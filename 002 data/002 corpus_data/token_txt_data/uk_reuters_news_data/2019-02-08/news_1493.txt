communist-run cuba starts rolling out internet on mobile phones
havana
reuters
cuba
has
started
providing
internet
on
the
mobile
phones
of
select
users
as
it
aims
to
roll
out
the
service
nationwide
by
in
a
further
step
towards
opening
one
of
the
western
hemisphere
s
least
connected
countries
journalists
at
news
outlets
were
among
the
first
this
year
to
get
mobile
internet
provided
by
cuba
s
telecoms
monopoly
as
part
of
a
wider
campaign
for
greater
internet
access
that
new
president
miguel
has
said
should
boost
the
economy
and
help
cubans
defend
their
revolution
analysts
said
broader
web
access
will
also
ultimately
weaken
the
government
s
control
of
what
information
reaches
people
in
the
island
state
that
has
a
monopoly
on
the
media
cuba
frowns
on
public
dissent
and
blocks
access
to
dissident
websites
it
s
been
a
radical
change
said
yuris
norido
who
reports
for
several
news
websites
and
the
television
i
can
now
update
on
the
news
from
wherever
i
am
including
where
the
news
is
taking
certain
customers
including
companies
and
embassies
have
also
been
able
to
buy
mobile
data
plans
since
december
according
to
the
website
of
cuban
telecoms
monopoly
etecsa
which
has
not
broadly
publicized
the
move
etecsa
has
said
it
will
expand
mobile
internet
to
all
its
million
mobile
phone
customers
nearly
half
of
cuba
s
population
by
the
end
of
this
year
etecsa
did
not
reply
to
a
request
for
more
details
for
this
story
whether
because
of
a
lack
of
cash
a
trade
embargo
or
concerns
about
the
flow
of
information
cuba
has
lagged
behind
in
web
access
until
internet
was
largely
only
available
to
the
public
at
tourist
hotels
in
cuba
but
the
government
has
since
then
made
increasing
connectivity
a
priority
introducing
cybercafes
and
outdoor
hotspots
and
slowly
starting
to
hook
up
homes
to
the
web
long
before
he
took
office
from
raul
castro
in
april
championed
the
cause
we
need
to
be
able
to
put
the
content
of
the
revolution
online
he
told
parliament
last
july
as
vice
president
adding
that
cubans
could
thus
counter
the
avalanche
of
banal
and
vulgar
cuba
could
use
subsidies
to
encourage
the
use
of
applications
analysts
said
last
month
etecsa
launched
a
free
messaging
application
todus
while
cuba
s
own
intranet
with
a
handful
of
sites
and
email
is
much
cheaper
to
access
than
the
wider
internet
in
a
document
about
its
internet
strategy
that
leaked
the
cuban
government
said
it
aimed
to
connect
at
least
half
of
homes
by
and
percent
of
phones
but
many
cubans
are
skeptical
etecsa
president
mayra
arevich
told
media
in
december
it
had
connected
just
homes
last
year
i
ve
been
many
times
to
the
etecsa
shop
to
ask
if
they
can
give
us
home
access
said
yuneisy
galindo
at
a
hotspot
on
one
of
havana
s
thoroughfares
but
they
tell
us
they
still
aren
t
ready
and
will
call
most
mobile
phone
owners
have
smartphones
although
cuba
is
only
now
installing
technology
even
as
most
of
latin
america
has
moved
onto
with
in
its
final
testing
phase
this
rollout
will
expand
slowly
at
first
and
then
more
quickly
if
the
government
is
increasingly
confident
that
it
can
control
any
political
fallout
said
cuba
expert
ted
henken
at
baruch
college
in
the
united
states
the
price
could
prove
the
biggest
restriction
for
many
though
hotspots
currently
charge
an
hour
compared
with
an
average
state
monthly
wage
of
it
was
not
clear
what
most
cubans
will
pay
for
mobile
internet
but
etecsa
is
charging
companies
and
embassies
a
month
for
four
gigabytes
