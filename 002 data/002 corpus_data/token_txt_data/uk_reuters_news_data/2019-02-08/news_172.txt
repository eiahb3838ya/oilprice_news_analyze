facebook
inc
said
on
thursday
it
had
removed
hundreds
of
accounts
which
it
judged
to
be
involved
in
coordinated
inauthentic
behaviour
on
its
platforms
including
some
linked
to
news
agency
sputnik
in
a
separate
statement
sputnik
attacked
the
social
network
for
a
decision
it
said
was
political
and
amounted
to
censorship
of
seven
facebook
pages
belonging
to
its
news
hubs
in
neighbouring
countries
facebook
head
of
cybersecurity
policy
nathaniel
gleicher
said
in
a
blog
post
it
had
unearthed
two
separate
operations
which
originated
in
russia
with
one
active
in
multiple
countries
across
eastern
europe
and
the
other
specific
to
ukraine
the
social
media
company
said
it
had
taken
down
about
facebook
pages
and
accounts
operating
in
baltic
sea
states
central
asia
the
caucasus
and
parts
of
europe
and
that
the
pages
were
linked
to
employees
of
sputnik
despite
their
misrepresentations
of
their
identities
we
found
that
these
pages
and
accounts
were
linked
to
employees
of
sputnik
gleicher
wrote
some
of
the
pages
frequently
posted
about
topics
like
sentiment
protest
movements
and
facebook
has
been
under
fire
for
the
last
two
years
for
its
sluggishness
in
developing
tools
to
combat
extremist
content
and
propaganda
operations
it
and
other
social
media
companies
have
targeted
foreign
interference
on
their
platforms
after
criticism
that
they
did
not
do
enough
to
detect
halt
and
disclose
russian
efforts
to
influence
the
outcome
of
the
presidential
race
iran
and
russia
have
both
denied
allegations
that
they
used
social
media
platforms
to
launch
disinformation
campaigns
but
facebook
and
twitter
inc
took
down
millions
of
posts
and
shuttered
accounts
linked
to
influence
operations
in
the
to
elections
last
november
facebook
also
said
that
based
on
a
tip
from
law
enforcement
it
had
separately
removed
pages
groups
and
accounts
and
instagram
accounts
that
originated
in
russia
and
operated
in
ukraine
we
didn
t
find
any
links
between
these
operations
but
they
used
similar
tactics
by
creating
networks
of
accounts
to
mislead
others
about
who
they
were
and
what
they
were
doing
the
company
said
with
the
accounts
facebook
said
it
identified
some
technical
overlap
with
activity
it
saw
prior
to
the
midterms
including
behaviour
that
shared
characteristics
with
previous
internet
research
agency
ira
activity
ira
was
indicted
by
special
counsel
robert
mueller
in
for
flooding
social
media
with
false
information
in
a
bid
to
sow
discord
in
the
to
the
election
a
new
york
times
report
in
november
contended
that
chief
executive
officer
mark
zuckerberg
and
other
executives
had
tried
to
deflect
criticism
internally
and
in
congress
about
russian
propaganda
spreading
through
facebook
over
the
last
three
years
zuckerberg
defended
his
response
to
russian
election
meddling
on
facebook
and
issued
a
new

aimed
at
stifling
misbehaviour
