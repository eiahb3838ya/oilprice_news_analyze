london
reuters
britain
s
brexit
minister
dominic
raab
wants
the
european
union
to
accept
assurances
that
the
country
will
remain
tied
to
the
bloc
s
rules
for
longer
in
return
for
making
a
hotly
contested
backstop
for
northern
ireland
unnecessary
talks
between
britain
and
the
european
union
have
stalled
over
a
disagreement
over
the
backstop
an
insurance
policy
to
ensure
there
will
be
no
return
to
a
hard
border
on
the
island
of
ireland
a
former
focal
point
for
sectarian
tensions
if
a
future
trading
relationship
is
not
in
place
in
time
raab
writing
in
the
sunday
telegraph
newspaper
said
britain
s
proposal
to
extend
its
brexit
transition
period
should
be
an
alternative
to
the
insurance
plan
the
prime
minister
has
rightly
refused
to
rule
out
considering
different
approaches
including
extending
the
implementation
period
for
a
limited
period
of
a
few
months
as
an
alternative
to
the
backstop
he
said
but
so
far
the
european
union
has
said
the
backstop
on
the
island
of
ireland
must
remain
in
place
to
proceed
with
the
divorce
negotiations
