the
court
banks
have
become
more
rigorous
after
the
financial
crisis

the

have
forced
the
industry
to
become
more
cautious
analysts
say
ubs
s
trial
in
france
follows
a
similar
judicial
process
in
the
united
states
where
the
bank
in
accepted
to
pay
million
in
a
settlement
in
germany
ubs
agreed
to
a
million
euro
fine
in
during
the
french
investigation
ubs
turned
down
a
settlement
offer
of
billion
euros
made
by
the
authorities
the
amount
corresponded
to
what
the
swiss
bank
had
already
paid
as
a
court
bond
according
to
judicial
sources
the
investigation
into
ubs
in
the
united
states
began
after
employee
bradley
birkenfeld
revealed
a
scheme
to
funnel
wealthy
customers
cash
from
the
united
states
to
switzerland
bypassing
the
taxman
birkenfeld
spoke
separately
to
french
investigators
even
though
he
is
not
due
to
testify
in
court
in
paris
he
intends
to
attend
all
the
hearings
the
whistleblower
told
reuters
that
he
hoped
for
a
heavy
penalty
for
the
swiss
bank
if
they
set
an
example
with
ubs
most
other
banks
will
be
scared
he
said
for
money
laundering
french
criminal
law
lets
judges
enforce
fines
as
high
as
half
the
amount
laundered
in
the
french
case
prosecutors
estimate
that
up
to
billion
euros
was
denied
to
the
french
tax
authorities
