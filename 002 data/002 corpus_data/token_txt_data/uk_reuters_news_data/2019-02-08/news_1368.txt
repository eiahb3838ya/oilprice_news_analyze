zimbabwe's mnangagwa promises probe of post-election killings, urges unity
harare
reuters
president
emmerson
mnangagwa
urged
zimbabweans
to
unite
on
friday
after
he
was
declared
the
first
elected
head
of
state
since
robert
mugabe
s
removal
from
power
but
the
opposition
leader
insisted
he
had
won
and
pledged
to
challenge
the
result
sounding
a
conciliatory
note
after
six
people
were
killed
in
a
crackdown
by
the
military
mnangagwa
vowed
to
be
president
for
all
zimbabweans
and
declared
his
rival
nelson
chamisa
would
have
a
vital
role
to
perform
in
zimbabwe
s
future
he
also
said
the
army
s
use
of
violence
in
harare
after
the
vote
would
be
investigated
independently
although
he
also
suggested
he
understood
the
resort
to
military
force
remarking
that
police
had
been
overwhelmed
by
opposition
demonstrators
the
army
s
clampdown
and
opposition
claims
that
the
vote
was
rigged
revealed
the
deep
fissures
in
zimbabwean
society
that
developed
during
the
rule
of
mugabe
when
the
security
forces
became
a
byword
for
in
an
apparent
effort
at
soothing
those
rifts
mnangagwa
said
to
nelson
chamisa
i
want
to
say
you
have
a
crucial
role
to
play
in
zimbabwe
s
present
and
its
unfolding
future
let
us
both
call
for
peace
and
unity
in
our
but
chamisa
told
reporters
mnangagwa
s
ruling
had
authorised
the
army
crackdown
on
opposition
supporters
because
it
knew
it
had
lost
the
election
the
first
since
the
army
removed
mugabe
from
office
in
november
we
are
going
to
explore
all
necessary
means
legal
and
constitutional
to
ensure
that
the
will
of
the
people
is
protected
chamisa
said
voting
passed
off
relatively
smoothly
on
the
day
raising
hopes
of
a
break
from
a
history
of
disputed
and
violent
polls
but
the
violence
in
harare
darkened
the
political
atmosphere
after
three
days
of
claims
and
counterclaims
mnangagwa
a
former
spy
chief
under
mugabe
secured
victory
he
polled
million
votes
against
million
for
chamisa
the
zimbabwe
electoral
commission
zec
announced
in
the
early
hours
of
friday
morning
this
is
a
new
beginning
let
us
join
hands
mnangagwa
said
on
twitter
we
won
the
election
freely
and
fairly
and
have
nothing
to
hide
or
his
bid
to
repair
the
image
of
a
nation
known
for
repression
and
economic
collapse
was
further
hurt
by
a
police
raid
on
the
headquarters
of
chamisa
s
movement
for
democratic
change
and
the
dispersal
of
journalists
before
a
chamisa
news
conference
mnangagwa
won
percent
of
the
vote
official
figures
showed
just
over
the
percent
mark
needed
to
avoid
a
runoff
the
delays
in
announcing
the
presidential
results
and
the
narrow
margin
of
victory
fuelled
the
opposition
accusations
of
rigging
he
now
faces
the
challenge
of
persuading
the
international
community
that
the
army
crackdown
and
lapses
in
the
election
process
will
not
derail
his
promise
of
political
and
economic
reforms
needed
to
fix
a
moribund
economy
european
union
observers
on
wednesday
cited
several
problems
including
media
bias
and
mistrust
in
the
electoral
commission
its
final
assessment
will
be
crucial
in
determining
whether
zimbabwe
can
return
to
the
international
fold
the
united
states
which
is
weighing
whether
to
lift
sanctions
against
zimbabwe
said
it
was
reviewing
data
by
its
own
and
other
election
observers
and
urged
all
sides
to
act
peacefully
we
encourage
all
stakeholders
and
citizens
to
pursue
any
grievances
peacefully
and
through
established
legal
channels
and
we
encourage
all
political
leaders
to
show
magnanimity
in
victory
and
graciousness
in
defeat
state

spokeswoman
heather
nauert
said
in
a
statement
chamisa
who
accused
the
commission
of
trying
to
rig
the
vote
said
it
should
release
proper
and
verified
results
he
told
a
news
conference
he
would
pursue
all
legal
means
necessary
to
challenge
the
result
which
had
serious
legitimacy
problems
he
declined
to
divulge
the
specific
action
that
his
party
would
take
to
challenge
the
election
outcome
christopher
dielmann
economist
at
exotix
capital
said
the
immediate
priorities
for
mnangagwa
would
be
to
continue
on
the
path
of
restoring
the
economy
and
boosting
exports
helped
by
international
engagement
by
many
accounts
this
imperfect
election
delivered
sufficient
transparency
especially
in
relation
to
past
results
in
the
country
that
should
allow
to
occur

maplecroft
said
for
international
investors
zimbabwe
s
election
was
less
about
an
mdc
or
a
win
and
far
more
about
electing
a
legitimate
stable
and
trustworthy
leader
there
is
a
bleak
pall
over
mnangagwa
s
win

to
