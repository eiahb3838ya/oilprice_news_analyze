north korea's 'mass games' provide tourist spectacle, and sobering reminder
pyongyang
reuters
packed
into
pyongyang
s
giant
stadium
this
week
with
thousands
of
other
tourists
australian
mitchell
hamilton
marvelled
at
the
return
of
north
korea
s
mass
games
a
huge
pageant
that
has
produced
some
of
the
most
iconic
images
of
the
isolated
country
my
thought
sitting
there
was
that
it
was
a
show
fit
for
a
god
hamilton
told
reuters
on
tuesday
atop
the
juche
tower
a
obelisk
in
downtown
pyongyang
you
can
t
help
but
get
swept
up
in
the
a
sobering
reminder
of
the
power
of
the
state
in
north
korea
however
was
the
realisation
that
many
of
the
thousands
of
performers
on
the
field
were
young
children
what
brought
me
back
down
to
earth
was
when
the
kids
ran
out
hamilton
said
leaning
in
to
speak
out
of
ear
shot
of
the
north
korean
guides
and
minders
who
were
accompanying
both
tourists
and
media
it
reminded
me
where
i
north
korea
s
first
mass
games
in
five
years
has
provided
a
chance
for
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
to
raise
foreign
currency
at
a
time
when
tourism
remains
one
of
the
few
remaining
reliable
sources
of
income
amid
tough
sanctions
since
a
reduction
in
tensions
over
north
korea
s
nuclear
weapons
programme
this
year
tour
operators
say
tourism
has
increased
exact
numbers
are
not
available
but
tour
operators
say
flights
and
accommodation
in
pyongyang
booked
up
so
fast
after
the
mass
games
were
announced
that
north
korean
authorities
put
holds
on
some
tour
groups
from
china
thousands
of
children
participate
in
the
performances
either
as
dancers
or
as
one
of
the
human
pixels
who
use
coloured
flipbooks
to
form
an
backdrop
of
images
and
slogans
that
practice
has
been
criticized
by
rights
groups
as
tantamount
to
forced
child
labour
and
testimonies
collected
by
defector
groups
describe
harsh
training
regimes
for
this
month
s
mass
games
elementary
middle
and
high
school
practiced
from
early
morning
until
late
at
night
the
website
daily
nk
said
citing
an
unnamed
source
past
reports
from
daily
nk
describe
students
taking
bladder
infection
medicine
due
to
the
long
hours
of
sitting
required
while
training
in
all
weather
for
months
beyond
the
sanctions
over
its
nuclear
weapons
programme
north
korea
is
an
impoverished
state
where
some
percent
of
the
population
or
more
than
million
people
need
humanitarian
assistance
and
about
percent
of
children
suffer
from
malnutrition
according
to
estimates
under
kim
s
rule
the
country
has
also
been
accused
of
widespread
human
rights
abuses
with
a
report
last
year
estimating
between
and
people
are
held
in
prison
camps
still
the
mass
games
performances
expected
to
run
into
early
october
are
a
major
drawcard
for
tourists
most
of
whom
come
from
china
i
think
i
ve
wanted
it
for
like
five
years
or
even
more
tia
nousiainen
from
finland
told
reuters
as
she
visited
tourist
sites
in
pyongyang
since
i
saw
the
first
mass
games
on
the
tv
or
the
internet
i
wanted
to
see
them
by
myself
and
every
year
i
ve
been
asking
the
travel
agency
if
they
are
arranging
them
and
this
year
i
got
the
answer
that
yes
they
are
arranging
personally
attended
by
kim
sunday
s
premiere
at
the
stadium
north
korea
says
can
hold
featured
new
displays
by
glowing
drone
formations
lasers
and
light
projections
thousands
of
dancers
gymnasts
martial
artists
and
singers
acted
out
scenes
addressing
familiar
themes
from
north
korean
propaganda
the
show
however
dropped
most
of
the
typical
themes
instead
focusing
on
kim
jong
un
s
diplomatic
engagement
with
international
leaders
joel
goh
a
visitor
from
singapore
said
the
mass
games
made
him
want
to
see
for
himself
the
country
behind
so
many
of
the
headlines
it
was
a
very
special
i
thought
it
was
as
good
as
any
other
show
i
ve
seen
he
said
adding
that
the
scenes
of
kim
embracing
south
korean
president
moon
at
their
first
summit
in
april
were
quite
we
ve
come
to
realize
it
s
a
bit
different
from
what
we
hear
outside
goh
said
of
north
korea
it
s
an
amazing
place
i
m
not
regretting
my
trip
