may
have
known
about
the

khashoggi
a
resident
and
washington
post

of

prince

had
a
hand
in

trump

t
his

trump

assessment
yesterday
s
statement
is
a
comic
statement
he
told

it
is
not
possible
for
an
intelligence
agency
such
as
the
cia
which
even
knows
the
colour
of
the
fur
on
the
cat
walking
around
the
saudi
consulate
s
garden
to
not
know
who
gave
this
order
he
said
this
is
not
credible
either
for

opinion
or
the
world
public
since
khashoggi
s
killing
at
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
last
month
turkey
has
repeatedly
said
the
order
came
from
the
highest
levels
of
the

government
although
it
has
not
directly
accused
prince
mohammed
saudi
arabia
has
denied
that
the
crown
prince
ordered
the
killing
after
offering
numerous
contradictory
explanations
riyadh
said
last
week
khashoggi
had
been
killed
and
his
body
dismembered
when
negotiations
to
persuade
him
to
return
to
saudi
arabia
failed
trump
said
saudi
arabia
a
major
oil
producer
was
an
important
business
partner
and
a
great
ally
in
the
fight
against
iranian
power
in
the
middle
east
following
a
meeting
with
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
in
washington
turkish
foreign
minister
mevlut
cavusoglu
said
ankara
is
not
entirely
satisfied
with
the
level
of
cooperation
it
is
receiving
from
saudi
arabia
regarding
the
case
cavusoglu
said
ankara
may
seek
a
formal
united
nations
inquiry
if
its
liaising
with
riyadh
comes
to
an
impasse
