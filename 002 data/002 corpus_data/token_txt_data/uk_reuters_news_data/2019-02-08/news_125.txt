reuters
russia
accused
the
united
states
on
thursday
of
trying
to
usurp
power
in
venezuela
and
warned
against
military
intervention
putting
it
at
odds
with
washington
and
the
eu
which
backed
protests
against
one
of
moscow
s
closest
allies
venezuelan
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
declared
himself
interim
leader
on
wednesday
winning
the
support
of
washington
and
parts
of
latin
america
that
prompted
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
who
has
led
the
nation
since
to
sever
diplomatic
ties
with
the
united
states
the
prospect
of
maduro
being
ousted
is
a
geopolitical
and
economic
headache
for
moscow
which
alongside
china
has
become
a
creditor
of
last
resort
for
caracas
lending
it
billions
of
dollars
as
its
economy
implodes
moscow
has
also
helped
its
military
and
oil
industry
and
provided
wheat
russia
on
thursday
accused
washington
of
stoking
street
protests
and
called
maduro
the
legitimate
president
we
consider
the
attempt
to
usurp
sovereign
authority
in
venezuela
to
contradict
and
violate
the
basis
and
principles
of
international
law
kremlin
spokesman
dmitry
peskov
said
the
russian
foreign
ministry
said
an
outside
military
intervention
could
have
catastrophic
turkish
president
tayyip
erdogan
offered
support
for
maduro
too
my
brother
maduro
stand
tall
we
stand
by
you
presidential
spokesman
ibrahim
kalin
writing
on
twitter
quoted
erdogan
as
saying
china
also
said
it
supported
efforts
to
protect
venezuela
s
independence
and
stability
the
european
union
which
has
imposed
sanctions
on
venezuela
and
boycotted
maduro
s
for
a
second
term
earlier
this
month
took
a
more
nuanced
tack
although
it
stopped
short
of
following
washington
and
recognising
guaido
as
interim
president
it
appealed
for
him
to
be
protected
and
appeared
to
support
calls
for
a
peaceful
transition
of
power
away
from
maduro
the
people
of
venezuela
have
massively
called
for
democracy
and
the
possibility
to
freely
determine
their
own
destiny
these
voices
can
not
be
ignored
the
bloc
said
the
biggest
group
in
the
european
parliament
the
european
people
s
party
said
it
recognised
guaido
as
interim
president
and
would
call
on
the
whole
parliament
to
do
so
next
week
as
a
senior
lawmaker
urged
maduro
to
quit
french
president
emmanuel
macron
saluted
venezuelans
marching
for
freedom
germany
switzerland
and
portugal
called
for
free
elections
and
spanish
prime
minister
pedro
sanchez
told
guaido
he
supported
the
venezuelan
parliament
britain
said
maduro
s
election
was
neither
free
nor
fair
and
expressed
support
for
guaido
there
was
nervousness
about
how
far
the
eu
could
go
however
the
problem
is
that
we
can
t
recognise
somebody
who
was
not
elected
democratically
said
one
eu
diplomat
that
would
create
a
dangerous
precedent
for
any
other
person
who
would
want
to
proclaim
themselves
the
