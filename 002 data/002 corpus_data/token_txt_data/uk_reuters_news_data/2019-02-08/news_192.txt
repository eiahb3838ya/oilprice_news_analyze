dutch
prime
minister
mark
rutte
warned
on
wednesday
that
time
is
running
out
to
reach
a
deal
before
britain
leaves
the
european
union
and
urged
the
british
to
make
up
their
minds
it
is
now
up
to
the
british
to
indicate
what
they
want
he
told
reporters
in
the
hague
in
reaction
to
tuesday
s
vote
against
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
brexit
deal
we
have
a
little
bit
more
time
but
it
is
really
going
down
to
the
we
still
hope
to
reach
an
agreement
before
they
leave
at
the
end
of
march
rutte
said
the
netherlands
one
of
the
world
s
leading
exporters
with
close
ties
to
the
british
economy
is
highly
vulnerable
to
international
trade
fluctuations
a
exit
is
of
course
worse
than
with
a
deal
what
the
netherlands
is
doing
is
trying
to
ensure
that
the
damage
is
minimised
rutte
said
he
added
that
britain
s
firm
demands
about
how
it
leaves
the
eu
meant
that
this
is
the
only
deal
possible
at
the
moment
if
they
were
to
move
on
those
demands
we
could
try
to
reach
another
agreement
but
unless
that
happens
this
is
the
only
option
the
dutch
premier
said
