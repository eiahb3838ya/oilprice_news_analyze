the
military
has
identified
the
first
two
american
troops
from
boxes
of
human
remains
from
the
korean
war
that
north
korea
handed
over
in
july
the
agency
leading
the
analysis
said
on
monday
the
identities
are
expected
to
be
officially
announced
in
the
coming
days
after
the
troops
relatives
are
informed
we
will
notify
the
family
first
said
john
byrd
director
of
scientific
analysis
at
the
defence
accounting
agency
as
he
stood
among
the
remains
undergoing
review
in
hawaii
president
donald
trump
s
administration
has
hailed
the
handover
of
the
remains
as
evidence
of
the
success
of
his
summit
with
north
koran
leader
kim
jong
un
in
june
the
white
house
said
on
monday
it
was
looking
at
scheduling
a
second
meeting
critics
however
say
the
summit
has
so
far
failed
to
deliver
on
promised
steps
to
get
kim
to
abandon
his
nuclear
weapons
programme
the
identifications
will
chip
away
at
the
troops
who
the
military
says
remain
unaccounted
for
from
the
korean
war
about
were
lost
in
what
is
now
north
korea
forensic
anthropologists
are
combing
through
the
remains
at
a
secure
facility
on
joint
base
pearl
byrd
and
jennie
jin
who
leads
the
agency
s
korean
war
project
explained
the
painstaking
identification
process
which
includes
methods
for
finding
dna
in
bone
fragments
sampling
for
dna
analysis
has
been
carried
out
so
far
on
about
half
of
the
boxes
of
remains
they
said
some
bone
fragments
are
as
small
as
a
quarter
other
bones
have
decayed
so
much
that
they
are
little
longer
than
a
pencil
however
the
sets
of
bones
from
the
two
troops
are
far
more
complete
we
noticed
within
a
few
seconds
of
opening
up
the
box
and
pulling
him
out
that
we
think
this
individual
is
african
american
and
tall
and
slender
byrd
said
and
that
kind
of
realization
that
we
have
was
made
possible
because
of
the
relatively
more
complete
condition
of
the
remains
the
remains
of
both
servicemembers
came
from
the
same
battlegrounds
near
the
chongchon
river
in
what
is
north
korea
troops
suffered
heavy
casualties
there
against
chinese
forces
that
had
intervened
in
the
war
it
s
a
huge
battle
said
jin
who
estimated
that
of
the
missing
forces
from
the
war
came
from
that
fight
alone
she
spoke
above
tables
of
bone
fragments
still
separated
with
numbers
corresponding
with
the
boxes
other
tables
included
personal
objects
from
soldiers
that
don
t
have
any
identification
on
them
including
buttons
canteens
and
old
boots
byrd
acknowledged
that
it
could
take
months
for
the
next
round
of
identifications
there
could
be
some
more
and
maybe
right
after
christmas
he
said
jin
a
south
american
citizen
said
the
work
has
a
personal
connection
her
grandfather
now
is
a
survivor
of
the
war
who
came
from
one
of
the
areas
of
north
korea
that
saw
some
of
the
heaviest
fighting
he
was
evacuated
south
on
a
navy
ship
she
said
it
s
really
personal
to
me
jin
said
the
july
transfer
coincided
with
the
anniversary
of
the
armistice
that
ended
fighting
between
north
korean
and
chinese
forces
and
south
korean
and
forces
under
the
command
the
two
sides
remain
technically
at
war
because
a
peace
treaty
was
never
signed
the
united
states
and
north
korea
conducted
joint
searches
for
remains
from
until
when
washington
halted
the
operations
citing
concerns
about
the
safety
of
its
personnel
as
pyongyang
stepped
up
its
nuclear
programme
