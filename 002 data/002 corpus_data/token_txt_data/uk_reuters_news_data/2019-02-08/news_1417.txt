washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
on
friday
denied
knowing
about
the
meeting
his
son
donald
trump
and
other
campaign
staff
held
at
trump
tower
with
a
group
of
russians
who
offered
damaging
information
about
democratic
rival
hillary
clinton
i
did
not
know
of
the
meeting
with
my
son
don
jr
trump
wrote
in
on
twitter
after
a
cnn
report
cited
his
longtime
lawyer
michael
cohen
as
saying
trump
had
known
about
the
meeting
in
advance
cnn
citing
unidentified
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
cohen
was
willing
to
make
that
assertion
to
special
counsel
robert
mueller
who
is
investigating
whether
trump
s
presidential
campaign
had
worked
with
russia
to
sway
the
presidential
election
federal
prosecutors
in
new
york
are
investigating
cohen
for
possible
bank
and
tax
fraud
and
for
possible
campaign
law
violations
linked
to
a
payment
to
adult
film
star
stormy
daniels
a
person
familiar
with
the
investigation
has
told
reuters
the
payment
to
daniels
who
says
she
had
an
intimate
relationship
with
trump
was
meant
to
buy
her
silence
over
the
affair
cohen
has
not
been
charged
with
any
crime
trump
who
has
said
in
the
past
he
did
not
know
about
the
meeting
in
advance
suggested
cohen
was
implicating
trump
in
exchange
for
possible
immunity
on
unrelated
charges
related
to
his
business
dealings
sounds
to
me
like
someone
is
trying
to
make
up
stories
in
order
to
get
himself
out
of
an
unrelated
jam
trump
speculated
on
twitter
without
supporting
his
claim
the
criticism
of
a
man
who
was
once
trump
s
fierce
defender
reflects
the
tensions
wrought
by
the
federal
investigations
in
new
york
and
washington
the
role
cohen
a
longtime
personal
confidant
of
trump
might
play
in
the
mueller
probe
is
unknown
on
wednesday
trump
expressed
disbelief
that
cohen
would
have
taped
conversations
with
him
a
day
after
an
audio
recording
of
a
conversation
between
the
two
men
was
aired
on
television
trump
personal
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
called
cohen
a
liar
on
thursday
night
after
the
cnn
report
on
the
trump
tower
meeting
he
s
been
lying
all
week
or
for
two
weeks
he
s
been
lying
for
years
giuliani
told
cnn
the
republican
president
has
been
infuriated
by
the
suggestion
he
might
owe
his
white
house
victory
to
russia
and
has
focussed
on
denying
the
collusion
allegations
rather
than
on
concerns
about
the
intelligence
community
s
findings
that
moscow
intervened
on
his
behalf
in
a
series
of
angry
twitter
posts
on
friday
morning
he
again
denied
any
collusion
with
moscow
and
denounced
the
mueller
probe
as
a
witch
hunt
russia
has
denied
meddling
in
the
election
cohen
did
not
return
a
request
for
comment
on
trump
s
tweet
or
the
cnn
report
his
attorney
lanny
davis
declined
to
comment
on
the
report

for
mueller
