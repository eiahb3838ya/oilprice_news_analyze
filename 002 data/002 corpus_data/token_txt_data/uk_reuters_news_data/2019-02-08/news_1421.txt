soaring
temperatures
in

have
led
to
an
increase
in
electricity
demand
equivalent
to
an
extra
million
homes
a
report
by
academics
at
imperial
college
london
said
on
friday
britain
s
prolonged
heatwave
has
prompted
a
warning
from
the
government
for
people
to
keep
out

efforts
to
keep

such
as
ramping

and

have
boosted
demand
for

demand
for
electricity
rises
megawatts
mw
for
every
degree
the
temperature
rises

degrees
celsius
the
report
said
unseasonably
high
temperatures
led
almost
mw
of
extra
power
demand
a
day
during
the
last
week
of
june
the
equivalent
to
demand
from
million
households

an

the
size

global
demand
for

is
only
going
to
increase
as

said
fortunately
for
the
national
grid
the
weeks
of
blazing
sunshine
that
have
driven
up
temperatures
have
also
boosted
production
from
the
country
s
solar
panels
solar
power
was
providing
almost
percent
of
the
country
s
electricity
at

and
sheffield
university
data
showed
last
year
solar
power
provided
around
percent
of
total
available
uk
power
based
on
government
figures
that
means
the
additional
power
demand
is
unlikely
to
cause
problems
the
warmer
weather
and
increased
demand
have
contributed
to
higher
power
prices
this
summer
average
british
wholesale

prices
averaged
around
pounds
per

over
june
and

around
percent
higher
