mahgoub
said
in
a
statement
on
saturday
secretary
of

as
he
explained

a
warning
that

would
hold
iran
directly
responsible
for
any
attacks
on
americans

diplomatic
facilities

that
pompeo
said
were
directed
at

said
the
rockets
however
had
not
impacted
the

which
is
located
on
the

have
made
clear
that

should
understand
that

any
such
attacks

did
not
explicitly
say
whether
a
response
was
imminent
however
and
other
officials
did
not
disclose
potential
response
options
still
pompeo
said

in

were
increasing
and
specific
and
added
that

was
working
with
iraqi

and
allies
to
address
them
we
look
to
all
international
parties
interested
in
peace
and
stability
in
iraq
and
the
region
to
reinforce
our
message
to
iran
regarding
the
unacceptability
of
their
behavior
he
said
in
a
statement
the
state
department
said
the
consulate
was
placed
on

is
believed
to
effectively
close

president
hassan
rouhani
exchanged
taunts
at

its
allies
or
harms
citizens

may

the
support
of
the
united

and
iran
despite
failing
