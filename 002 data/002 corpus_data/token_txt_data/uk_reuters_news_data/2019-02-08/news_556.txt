factbox: what might a no-deal brexit look like?
london
reuters
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
in
just
over
four
months
time
but
it
still
can
not
count
on
a
transition
period
to
cushion
the
shock
for
its
economy
prime
minister
theresa
may
last
week
agreed
a
draft
withdrawal
deal
with
brussels
but
it
faces
stiff
resistance
in
her
conservative
party
meaning
it
could
fail
in
parliament
following
is
an
outline
of
what
a
brexit
might
look
like
bank
of
england
governor
mark
carney
says
brexit
without
a
transition
would
deliver
a
large
negative
shock
to
the
economy
which
could
be
akin
to
the
oil
crisis
the
international
monetary
fund
forecasts
the
economy
would
shrink
without
a
brexit
deal
the
national
institute
of
economic
and
social
research
a
think
tank
predicts
the
economy
would
grow
by
percent
in
and
without
a
deal
compared
with
percent
and
percent
if
there
is
one
barriers
to
trade
would
go
up
at
least
in
the
short
term
hurting
companies
on
both
sides
of
the
english
channel
british
exporters
would
face
eu
import
tariffs
which
average
percent
but
are
higher
for
major
british
exports
such
as
cars
which
would
pay
a
percent
tariff
manufacturers
across
the
board
are
also
worried
about
border
delays
which
would
hurt
their
production
but
brexit
supporters
say
technology
would
ease
any
border
delays
and
exports
would
flow
freely
if
britain
gets
a
future
eu
free
trade
deal
they
also
say
deals
with
economies
such
as
the
united
states
india
and
china
would
help
britain
more
than
remaining
close
to
the
eu
britain
s
budget
forecasters
say
the
benefits
of
these
bilateral
trade
deals
are
likely
to
be
small
ports
and
airports
are
likely
to
see
the
first
impact
the
government
has
plans
to
turn
two
motorways
and
an
airport
in
the
south
of
england
into
lorry
parks
if
needed
france
is
preparing
various
measures
notably
those
dealing
with
customs
controls
and
checks
at
ports
in
case
there
is
no
brexit
deal
according
to
french
transport
minister
elisabeth
borne
the
chartered
institute
of
procurement
supply
estimates
that
one
in
british
businesses
fear
they
would
go
bankrupt
if
goods
were
delayed
by
minutes
at
customs
many
manufacturers
are
stockpiling
parts
to
keep
production
lines
open
in
the
event
of
border
delays
the
british
government
has
asked
drugmakers
to
stockpile
medicines
for
six
weeks
above
normal
operations
chancellor
philip
hammond
has
built
up
a
fiscal
to
spend
more
in
case
of
a
brexit
shock
to
the
economy
but
he
has
also
warned
that
longer
term
a
brexit
would
mean
a
rethink
of
his
promise
to
end
austerity
brexit
supporters
say
leaving
the
eu
with
no
deal
would
help
the
public
finances
because
it
would
mean
an
immediate
end
to
payments
by
london
into
the
eu
budget
the
boe
has
warned
investors
not
to
assume
that
it
would
rush
to
the
rescue
in
the
event
of
a
brexit
shock
a
fall
in
the
value
of
the
pound
would
push
up
inflation
potentially
preventing
interest
rate
cuts
given
the
likely
economic
hit
a
brexit
would
probably
push
the
pound
down
adding
to
its
losses
against
the
dollar
of
about
percent
since
the
referendum
a
reuters
poll
of
market
strategists
published
on
predicted
sterling
would
sink
by
more
than
percent
if
no
deal
is
reached
but
could
rise
about
percent
if
one
is
struck
a
weaker
pound
could
push
up
the
share
prices
of
many
of
the
country
s
biggest
companies
which
do
business
around
the
world
such
as
british
american
tobacco
and
gsk
in
the
ftse
which
makes
percent
of
its
income
overseas
but
there
could
be
punishment
for
the
more
domestically
focussed
ftse
companies
who
make
half
their
money
at
home
that
would
make
sense
if
the
traditional
correlations
hold
true
last
week
the
trend
briefly
broke
down
and
the
ftse
and
the
pound
both
fell
moving
in
rare
lockstep
as
the
growing
risk
of
a
disorderly
divorce
spooked
investors
the
economic
shock
of
a
brexit
would
normally
encourage
investors
to
seek
the
safe
haven
of
british
government
bonds
gilt
yields
which
move
in
the
opposite
direction
to
prices
fell
by
the
most
since
on
thursday
however
a
brexit
would
be
a
major
blow
to
may
and
could
usher
in
a
new
national
election
the
labour
party
leads
some
opinion
polls
and
its
plans
for
big
increases
in
public
spending
would
unsettle
some
investors
