hammond backs calls for tougher bank disputes scheme
london
reuters
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
philip
hammond
called
on
banks
to
strengthen
a
proposed
redress
scheme
for
small
businesses
which
lawmakers
and
victims
argue
is
too
soft
on
lenders
a
dispute
service
proposed
by
uk
finance
which
represents
banks
must
include
a
broad
range
of
interests
and
not
impose
a
compensation
cap
hammond
said
in
a
letter
released
on
tuesday
the
voluntary
scheme
was
proposed
in
response
to
a
decade
of
campaigning
by
small
firms
who
say
they
were
mistreated
by
their
banks
in
the
wake
of
the
financial
crisis
it
is
aimed
at
companies
with
a
turnover
of
between
million
and
million
pounds
which
is
above
the
eligibility
threshold
for
taking
complaints
to
britain
s
free
financial
services
ombudsman
leaving
them
facing
a
costly
court
case
if
they
want
to
pursue
a
lender
it
includes
a
binding
commitment
on
banks
to
pay
compensation
up
to
pounds
for
historic
complaints
that
date
back
to
the
financial
crisis
a
decade
ago
although
the
scheme
could
recommend
a
higher
amount
uk
finance
which
declined
to
comment
is
setting
up
a
steering
group
to
thrash
out
details
of
the
new
scheme
but
lawmakers
told
reuters
this
month
it
was
too
easy
on
banks
kevin
hollinrake
of
the
parliamentary
group
for
fair
business
banking
appg
has
said
he
would
refuse
a
seat
on
the
steering
group
unless
concerns
over
eligibility
governance
and
claims
limits
were
addressed
hammond
in
a
letter
to
uk
finance
chief
executive
stephen
jones
emphasised
the
need
for
the
steering
group
to
have
balanced
representation
from
banks
business
representatives
and
other
parties
it
is
vital
that
different
perspectives
are
heard
during
this
implementation
stage
to
ensure
that
the
schemes
are
regarded
as
truly
robust
and
independent
hammond
said
in
the
letter
which
was
dated
banks
default
position
should
be
to
pay
whatever
sum
the
new
scheme
awarded
in
compensation
hammond
said
the
appg
welcomed
hammond
s
comments
saying
we
are
particularly
pleased
that
the
chancellor
has
set
an
expectation
that
the
bank
s
default
position
should
be
that
there
is
no
cap
on
the
amount
of
compensation
