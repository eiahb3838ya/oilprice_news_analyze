the

to
convene
his
cabinet

the
first
time
since
the
crisis
began
underlined
madrid
s
opposition
to
full
independence
for
the
prosperous
northeastern
region
of
million
people
but
it
could
also
help
him
to
secure
the
survival
of
his
minority
government
with
the
aid
of
catalonian
parties
in
return
for
more
autonomy
sanchez
who
has
been
trying
to
get
voters
on
his
side
before
a
series
of

a
statement
as
their
notable
differences
friday
s
protests
were
patrolled
by
catalonia
s
local
police
force

of
batons
and
rubber
bullets
caused
an
outcry
meeting
at
a
century
building
on
barcelona
s
historic
sea
front
the
cabinet
approved
a
handful
of
symbolic
measures

no
value

on
the
eve
of
sanchez
s
visit
and
their
party
vowed
to
back
his
broad
plan
for
the
national
budget
in
and
failure
to
approve
the
budget
could
topple
the
government
raising
the
possibility
of
a
administration
with
stronger
centralist
preferences
a
risk
some
catalan
politicians
would
prefer
