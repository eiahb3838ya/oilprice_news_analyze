manchester
city
forward
raheem
sterling
believes
newspapers
are
helping
fuel
racism
and
aggressive
behaviour
with
their
portrayal
of
young
black
players
the
made
the
comments
in
an
instagram
post
on

a
day

alleged
racist
abuse
from
a
supporter
during

and
phil
foden
who

the
headline
referring
to

who
is
black
focuses
on
how
he
spent
million
pounds
million
on
a
house
despite
having
never
started
a
premier
league
match
while
that
on
foden
says
he
bought
a
million
pound
home
for
his
mum
you
have
two
players
starting
out
their
careers
both
play
for
the
same
team
both
have
done
the
right
thing
which
is
buy
a
new
house
for
their
mothers
who
have
put
in
a
lot
of
time
and
love
into
helping
them
get
where
they
are
sterling
wrote
but
look
at
how
the
newspapers
get
their
message
across
for
the
young
black
player
and
then
for
the
young
white
player
i
think
this
is
unacceptable
both
innocent
have
not
done
a
thing
wrong
but
just
by
the
way
it
has
been
worded
this
young
black
kid
is
looked
at
in
a
bad
light
which
helps
fuel
racism
and
aggressive
addressing
the
alleged
abuse
he
received
at
stamford
bridge
sterling
said
that
he
had
to
laugh
when
he
heard
the
remarks
because
he
expects
no
better

man
was
jailed
for

racially
aggravated
