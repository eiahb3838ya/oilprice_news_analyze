pope travels to transformed ireland as abuse crises rage
dublin
reuters
pope
francis
will
arrive
in
ireland
on
saturday
to
find
a
society
transformed
since
the
last
papal
visit
years
ago
and
beset
by
the
kind
of
abuse
scandals
that
have
mired
the
catholic
church
in
crisis
again
more
than
of
the
irish
population
flocked
to
see
pope
john
paul
ii
in
at
a
time
when
divorce
and
contraception
were
illegal
today
ireland
is
no
longer
staunchly
catholic
and
over
the
past
three
years
voters
have
approved
abortion
and
gay
marriage
in
referendums
defying
the
will
of
the
church
numbers
lining
the
streets
or
joining
francis
in
prayer
are
expected
to
be
about
a
quarter
of
the
million
who
greeted
john
paul
ii
marking
how
the
rock
that
was
once
irish
catholicism
has
eroded
since
child
abuse
cases
came
to
light
in
the
the
catholic
church
is
still
very
much
part
of
our
society
but
not
at
the
centre
of
it
as
it
was
years
ago
prime
minister
leo
varadkar
who
last
year
became
ireland
s
first
gay
leader
told
the
bbc
ireland
has
become
a
very
different
place
in
the
last
years
and
our
relationship
with
the
church
has
changed
principally
because
of
so
many
revelations
that
have
occurred
around
child
sex
varadkar
who
remarked
how
some
his
predecessors
would
have
consulted
bishops
about
public
policy
in
decades
past
will
meet
francis
at
the
start
of
the
visit
and
has
promised
to
challenge
the
pope
to
do
more
in
dealing
with
the
abuse
crisis
francis
facing
sexual
abuse
crises
in
several
countries
wrote
an
unprecedented
letter
to
all
catholics
this
week
asking
each
one
of
them
to
help
root
out
this
culture
of
death
and
vowing
there
would
be
no
more
cover
ups
he
will
also
travel
to
knock
a
small
western
village
steeped
in
catholicism
that
welcomes
million
pilgrims
a
year
before
finishing
his
trip
by
saying
mass
in
dublin
s
phoenix
park
where
a
large
cross
erected
for
the
visit
still
dominates
the
skyline
the
tickets
issued
for
the
mass
were
quickly
snapped
up
although
an
unknown
number
have
been
booked
by
a
boycott
group
called
say
nope
to
the
pope
which
encouraged
protestors
to
order
tickets
and
not
use
them
abuse
survivors
and
their
supporters
plan
to
gather
elsewhere
in
dublin
during
the
mass
while
a
silent
vigil
will
also
be
held
at
the
site
of
a
former
home
for
unwed
mothers
where
an
unmarked
grave
with
the
remains
of
hundreds
of
babies
was
found
in
the
vatican
has
said
francis
will
meet
irish
victims
of
clergy
sexual
abuse
but
the
pope
will
also
be
under
pressure
to
address
the
recent
scandals
that
have
led
to
the
church
s
worst
credibility
crisis
in
more
than
years
a
damning
report
last
week
into
abuse
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
combined
with
scandals
in
australia
and
chile
have
formed
what
one
vatican
official
called
a
perfect
storm
and
already
overshadowed
a
trip
where
the
main
purpose
is
to
close
a
international
catholic
gathering
each
time
a
local
church
has
found
itself
facing
a
scandal
it
is
as
if
the
church
must
start
all
over
again
to
understand
the
depths
of
this
heart
of
darkness
