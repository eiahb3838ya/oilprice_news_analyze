reuters
prime
minister
theresa
may
will
tell
the
people
of
northern
ireland
on
friday
that
her
brexit
plan
is
the
best
way
to
avoid
a
hard
border
with
ireland
standing
firm
against
critics
in
her
own
party
still
reeling
from
the
resignation
last
week
of
senior
cabinet
members
and
with
her
own
political
future
uncertain
may
will
also
call
on
the
european
union
to
give
some
ground
in
talks
on
britain
s
departure
from
the
bloc
may
flew
to
northern
ireland
on
thursday
for
a
visit
to
see
up
close
the
troubled
british
region
s
frontier
with
ireland
which
has
become
one
of
the
biggest
stumbling
blocks
in
the
negotiations
after
quitting
the
cabinet
former
foreign
secretary
boris
johnson
singled
out
her
treatment
of
the
border
as
the
biggest
mistake
of
her
negotiations
with
the
eu
for
a
smooth
exit
from
the
bloc
next
year
may
s
brexit
white
paper
the
policy
document
which
prompted
johnson
s
resignation
proposes
negotiating
the
closest
possible
commercial
links
for
goods
trade
to
protect
businesses
and
to
fulfil
a
commitment
to
avoid
having
infrastructure
on
the
border
the
mile
border
has
been
largely
invisible
since
army
checkpoints
were
taken
down
after
a
peace
deal
ended
three
decades
of
violence
between
the
region
s
majority
and
an
irish
nationalist
minority
over
died
the
economic
and
constitutional
dislocation
of
a
formal
third
country
customs
border
within
our
own
country
is
something
i
will
never
accept
and
i
believe
no
british
prime
minister
could
ever
accept
may
is
to
tell
a
crowd
at
belfast
s
waterfront
hall
on
friday
according
to
the
extracts
of
the
speech
provided
by
her
office
instead
she
will
say
that
she
believes
the
close
regulatory
alignment
on
goods
trade
as
described
in
her
white
paper
will
meet
her
commitment
to
prevent
the
inconceivable
eventuality
of
a
hard
border
it
is
now
for
the
eu
to
respond
not
simply
to
fall
back
onto
previous
positions
which
have
already
been
proven
unworkable
but
to
evolve
their
position
in
kind
she
will
say
according
to
the
politicians
have
warned
that
the
of
physical
infrastructure
on
the
border
when
it
becomes
the
eu
s
external
frontier
would
anger
irish
nationalists
in
northern
ireland
who
aspire
to
unification
with
the
republic
of
ireland
and
help
militants
opposed
to
the
peace
deal
to
recruit
new
members
may
has
refused
to
accept
a
backstop
solution
proposed
by
the
european
union
in
which
northern
ireland
would
remain
closely
aligned
with
the
european
union
s
single
market
and
customs
union
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
create
a
border
between
northern
ireland
and
the
rest
of
the
united
kingdom
johnson
on
wednesday
told
parliament
that
may
had
unnecessarily
let
the
readily
soluble
border
issue
become
so
politically
charged
as
to
dominate
the
debate
pushing
may
towards
a
close
alignment
with
the
eu
he
described
as
a
miserable
permanent
limbo
the
process
of
withdrawal
will
be
complex
and
it
will
require
hard
work
serious
work
and
detailed
work
may
will
say
in
belfast
the
government
has
done
that
work
the
white
paper
is
our
plan
for
the
the
first
stop
in
may
s
visit
was
the
border
village
of
belleek
in
fermanagh
the
home
county
of
democratic
unionist
party

foster
whose
party
provides
votes
in
britain

lower
house
of
parliament
that
may
needs
to
govern
she
arrived
in
belleek
by
helicopter
before
touring
a
pottery
factory
with
foster
this
visit
will
enable
mrs
may
to
speak
with
people
who
live
work
and
travel
across
the
much
talked
about
irish
border
on
a
daily
basis
foster
said
in
an
earlier
statement
on
friday
may
will
meet
the
