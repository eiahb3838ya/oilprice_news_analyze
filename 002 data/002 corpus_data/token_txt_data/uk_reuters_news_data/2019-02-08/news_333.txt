global
equity
markets
gave
up
earlier
gains
and
continued
a
weeklong
on
wednesday
after
the
federal
reserve
announced
a
fresh
interest
rate
hike
and
said
some
further
rate
hikes
would
be
necessary
in
the
year
ahead

points
off

index
of
global
stocks
down
nearly
percent
for
the
day
the
index
is
down
nearly
percent
since
the
start
of
december
due
to
concerns
that
global
economic
growth
is
slowing
this
is
clearly
a
disappointment
for
those
hoping
for
a
dovish
rate
hike
said
david
joy
chief
market
strategist
at
ameriprise
financial
in
boston
it
is
a
more
moderate
rate
hike
but
it
is
a
rate
hike
and
there
is
still
a
gap
between
where
the
fed
is
and
where
the
market
is
in
terms
of
policy
expectations
for
next
on
wall

the
dow

s
remarks
added
to
the
selling
pressure
in
stocks
when
he
said
the
pace
of
the
balance
sheet
reduction
is
on
a
preset
course
and
adjusting
the
pace
of
the
balance
sheet
reduction
is
not
an
option
at
this
time
the
central
bank
s
rate
hike
will
likely
dampen
investor
appetite
for
riskier
assets
throughout
the

it
s
a
confluence
of
several
important
factors

adjusting
its
outlook
on
growth
and
there
is
a
consensus
we
will
