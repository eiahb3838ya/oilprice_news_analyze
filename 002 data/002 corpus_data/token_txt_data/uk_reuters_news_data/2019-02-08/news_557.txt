said
on

it
would
remove
listings
in
israeli
settlements
in
the
occupied

a
move
israel
called
a
wretched
capitulation
to
boycotters
and
palestinians
hailed
as
a
step
towards
peace
the
decision
affecting
some
listings
would
take
effect
in
the
coming
days
airbnb
said
israel
captured
the
west
bank
in
a
war
its
settlements
there
are
considered
illegal
by
most
world
powers
palestinians
deem
the
settlements
and
the
military
presence
needed
to
protect
them
to
be
obstacles
to
their
goal
of
establishing
a
state
israel
disputes
this
we
concluded
that
we
should
remove
listings
in
israeli
settlements
in
the
occupied
west
bank
that
are
at
the
core
of
the
dispute
between
israelis
and
palestinians
airbnb
said
on
its
website
our
hope
is
that
someday
sooner
rather
than
later
a
framework
is
put
in
place
where
the
entire
global
community
is
aligned
so
there
will
be
a
resolution
to
this
historic
conflict
and
a
clear
path
forward
for
everybody
to
palestinians
and
their
supporters
had
long
lobbied
airbnb
to
delist
the
settlements
israel
strongly
opposes
such
calls
for
boycotts
which
it
considers
a
biased
approach
to
the
conflict
israeli
tourism
minister
yariv
levin
called
airbnb
s
move
the
most
wretched
of
wretched
capitulations
to
the
boycott
efforts
speaking
on
israel
s
channel
television
he
said
israel
was
not
told
of
the
decision
in
advance
and
that
it
would
respond
by
backing
lawsuits
by
settlement
listers
against
airbnb
in
courts
waleed
assraf
head
of
a
palestinian
group
run
by
the
umbrella
palestine
liberation
organisation
welcomed
airbnb
s
decision
should
other
companies
follow
suit
he
told
reuters
this
will
contribute
to
achieving
peace
oded
revivi
mayor
of
the
west
bank
settlement
of
efrat
and
a
representative
of
the
umbrella
settler
council
yesha
said
airbnb
s
decision
was
contrary
to
the
company
s
stated
mission
of
helping
to
bring
people
together
in
as
many
places
as
possible
around
the
world
when
they
make
such
a
decision
they
get
involved
with
politics
which
is
going
to
defeat
the
actual
purpose
of
the
enterprise
itself
revivi
told
reuters
human
rights
watch
said
the
airbnb
move
came
on
the
eve
of
its
publication
of
a
report
it
has
carried
out
into
tourist
rental
listings
in
settlements
including
by
airbnb
airbnb
s
decision
to
end
its
listings
in
israeli
settlements
is
an
important
recognition
that
such
listings
can
t
square
with
its
human
rights
responsibilities
the
group
said
on
monday
we
urge
other
companies
to
follow
the
group
said
its
report

some
israelis
live
in
the
west

areas
that
are
also
home
to
more

of

as
a
security
bulwark
to
the

palestinians
want
the
