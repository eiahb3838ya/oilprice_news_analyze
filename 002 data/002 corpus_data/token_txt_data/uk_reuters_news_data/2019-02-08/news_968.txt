reuters
president
donald
trump
on
wednesday
accused
china
of
seeking
to
meddle
in
the
congressional
elections
saying
beijing
did
not
want
his
republican
party
to
do
well
because
of
his
pugnacious
stance
on
trade
china
has
been
attempting
to
interfere
in
our
upcoming
election
coming
up
in
november
against
my
administration
trump
told
a
security
council
meeting
whose
ostensible
subject
was
nonproliferation
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
chairing
the
council
for
the
first
time
trump
made
no
reference
to
suspected
russian
meddling
in
the
election
and
provided
no
evidence
for
his
allegation
about
china
which
beijing
immediately
rejected
during
the
same
meeting
we
did
not
and
will
not
interfere
in
any
country
s
domestic
affairs
we
refuse
to
accept
any
unwarranted
accusations
against
china
the
chinese
government
s
top
diplomat
wang
yi
told
the
council
the
united
states
and
china
are
embroiled
in
a
trade
war
sparked
by
trump
s
accusations
that
china
has
long
sought
to
steal
intellectual
property
limit
access
to
its
own
market
and
unfairly
subsidise
companies
later
on
wednesday
trump
referred
to
a
chinese
media
company
s
supplement
in
the
sunday
des
moines
register
promoting
the
mutual
benefits
of
trade
the
practice
of
foreign
governments
buying
space
in
newspapers
to
promote
trade
is
common
and
differs
from
a
clandestine
operation
run
by
a
national
intelligence
agency
china
is
actually
placing
propaganda
ads
in
the
des
moines
register
and
other
papers
made
to
look
like
news
trump
said
in
a
twitter
post
in
a
des
moines
register
article
about
the
advertising
supplement
carol
hunter
executive
editor
of
the
newspaper
said
the
placement
was
not
surprising
it
s
not
surprising
that
china
daily
sought
to
place
advertising
with
the
des
moines
register
because
the
register
is
iowa
s
largest
news
organisation
and
iowa
farmers
are
disproportionately
affected
by
china
s
tariffs
hunter
said
a
senior
trump
administration
official
said
china
uses
political
economic
commercial
military
and
information
tools
to
influence
public
opinion
and
promote
the
interests
of
the
chinese
government
and
communist
party
vice
president
mike
pence
plans
to
make
a
speech
next
week
detailing
the
allegations
said
the
official
who
spoke
to
reporters
on
condition
of
anonymity
saying
the
government
was
working
to
declassify
further
information
on
the
matter
during
an
evening
news
conference
trump
described
chinese
president
xi
jinping
as
a
friend
prompting
a
reporter
to
ask
how
that
could
be
the
case
given
the
allegations
of
meddling
maybe
he
s
not
any
more
i
ll
be
honest
with
you
trump
replied
trump
also
used
the
security
council
session
to
defend
the
withdrawal
in
may
from
a
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
hint
at
progress
in
efforts
to
curb
north
korea
s
nuclear
programme
and
to
criticise
iran
and
russia
for
supporting
syrian
president
bashar
in
the
country
s
war
now
in
its
eighth
year
the
syrian
regime
s
butchery
is
enabled
by
russia
and
iran
trump
said
iranian
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
responded
in
a
twitter
post
saying
the
united
states
had
abused
the
council
and
is
further
trump
s
allegation
of
chinese
election
meddling
came
as
a
surprise
during
a
formal
meeting
around
the
security
council
s
horseshoe
table
that
was
expected
to
concentrate
on
the
spread
of
nuclear
chemical
and
biological
weapons
they
do
not
want
me
or
us
to
win
because
i
am
the
first
president
ever
to
challenge
china
on
trade
and
we
are
winning
on
trade
we
are
winning
at
every
level
we
don
t
want
them
to
meddle
or
interfere
in
our
upcoming
election
said
trump
who
is
attending
the
s
annual
gathering
of
world
leaders
trump
himself
is
not
up
for
until
but
november
s
voting
will
decide
whether
his
republican
party
can
keep
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
some
opinion
polls
show
that
the
democratic
party
could
make
a
strong
showing
notably
in
the
house
in
the
latest
salvo
in
the
trade
dispute
tariffs
on
billion
billion
pounds
worth
of
chinese
goods
and
retaliatory
taxes
by
beijing
on
billion
worth
of
products
kicked
in
on
monday
unnerving
global
financial
markets
during
his
roughly
speech
trump
made
no
reference
to
allegations
against
russia
concerning
the
election
that
brought
him
to
power
speaking
later
to
reporters
trump
said
they
china
are
trying
to
meddle
in
our
elections
and
we
re
not
going
to
let
that
happen
just
as
we
re
not
going
to
let
that
happen
with
trump
s
presidency
has
been
dogged
by
the
russian
issue
which
led
to
an
investigation
by
special
counsel
robert
mueller
into
potential
collusion
between
moscow
and
the
trump
campaign
which
trump
rejects
moscow
