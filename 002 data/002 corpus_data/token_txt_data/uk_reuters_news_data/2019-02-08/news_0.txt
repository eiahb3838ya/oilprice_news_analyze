exclusive-u.s. in direct contact with venezuelan military, urging  defections -source
washington
reuters
the
united
states
is
holding
direct
communications
with
members
of
venezuela
s
military
urging
them
to
abandon
president
nicolas
maduro
and
is
also
preparing
new
sanctions
aimed
at
increasing
pressure
on
him
a
senior
white
house
official
said
the
trump
administration
expects
further
military
defections
from
maduro
s
side
the
official
told
reuters
in
an
interview
despite
only
a
few
senior
officers
having
done
so
since
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
declared
himself
interim
president
last
month
earning
the
recognition
of
the
united
states
and
dozens
of
other
countries
we
believe
these
to
be
those
first
couple
pebbles
before
we
start
really
seeing
bigger
rocks
rolling
down
the
hill
the
official
said
this
week
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
we
re
still
having
conversations
with
members
of
the
former
maduro
regime
with
military
members
although
those
conversations
are
very
very
the
official
declined
to
provide
details
on
the
discussions
or
the
level
at
which
they
are
being
held
and
it
was
unclear
whether
such
contacts
could
create
cracks
in
the
venezuelan
socialist
leader
s
support
from
the
military
which
is
pivotal
to
his
grip
on
power
with
the
venezuelan
military
still
apparently
loyal
to
maduro
a
source
in
washington
close
to
the
opposition
expressed
doubts
whether
the
trump
administration
has
laid
enough
groundwork
to
spur
a
wider
mutiny
in
the
ranks
where
many
officers
are
suspected
of
benefiting
from
corruption
and
drug
trafficking
members
of
the
south
american
country
s
security
forces
fear
they
or
their
families
could
be
targeted
by
maduro
if
they
defect
so
the
would
need
to
offer
them
something
that
could
outweigh
those
concerns
said
eric
farnsworth
vice
president
of
the
council
of
the
americas
think
tank
in
washington
it
depends
on
what
they
re
offering
farnsworth
said
are
there
incentives
built
into
these
contacts
that
will
at
least
cause
people
to
question
their
loyalty
to
the
regime
guaido
says
the
may
vote
in
which
maduro
won
a
second
term
as
president
was
a
sham
and
on
invoked
a
constitutional
provision
to
declare
himself
president
promising
free
and
fair
elections
the
government
also
sees
european
allies
as
likely
to
do
more
to
prevent
maduro
from
transferring
or
hiding
venezuela
government
assets
held
outside
the
country
the
official
said
major
european
countries
have
joined
the
united
states
in
backing
guaido
but
they
have
stopped
short
of
the
sweeping
oil
sanctions
and
financial
measures
that
washington
has
imposed
at
the
same
time
the
trump
administration
is
readying
further
possible
sanctions
on
venezuela
the
official
said
previous
rounds
have
targeted
dozens
of
venezuelan
military
and
government
officials
including
maduro
himself
and
last
month
finally
hit
the
opec
member
s
vital
oil
sector
but
the
administration
has
stopped
short
of
imposing
secondary
sanctions
which
would
punish
companies
for
doing
business
with
the
venezuela
government
or
the
state
oil
monopoly
pdvsa
the
official
said
that
washington
had
every
tool
available
to
apply
pressure
on
maduro
and
his
associates
to
accept
a
legitimate
democratic
the
government
is
also
weighing
possible
sanctions
on
cuban
military
and
intelligence
officials
whom
it
says
are
helping
maduro
remain
in
power
a
second
official
and
person
familiar
with
the
deliberations
have
told
reuters
maduro
s
government
has
accused
guaido
who
has
galvanized
venezuela
s
opposition
of
attempting
to
stage
a
coup
general
francisco
yanez
of
the
air
force
s
high
command
became
the
first
active
venezuelan
general
to
recognise
guaido
but
he
is
one
of
about
generals
venezuela
s
chief
military
attache
to
the
united
states
also
said
he
was
defecting
late
last
month
guaido
has
actively
courted
members
of
the
military
with
promises
of
amnesty
and
preferential
legal
treatment
if
they
disavow
maduro
and
disobey
his
orders
and
washington
this
week
raised
the
prospect
of
dropping
sanctions
on
senior
venezuelan
officers
if
they
recognise
guaido
maduro
still
has
the
support
of
the
military
high
command
and
now
routinely
appears
in
events
at
military
bases
where
officers
stand
behind
him
and
chant
triumphal
slogans
such
as
loyal
always
traitors
