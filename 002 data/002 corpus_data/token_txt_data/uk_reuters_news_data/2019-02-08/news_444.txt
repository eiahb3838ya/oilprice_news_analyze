brussels
reuters
the
united
states
delivered
russia
a
ultimatum
on
tuesday
to
come
clean
about
what
washington
says
is
a
violation
of
a
arms
control
treaty
that
keeps
missiles
out
of
europe
saying
only
moscow
could
save
the
pact
nato
allies
led
by
germany
pressed
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
at
a
meeting
in
brussels
to
give
diplomacy
a
final
push
before
washington
pulls
out
of
the
nuclear
forces
treaty
fearing
a
new
arms
race
in
europe
russia
has
a
last
chance
to
show
in
a
verifiable
way
that
they
comply
with
the
treaty
but
we
also
have
to
start
to
prepare
for
the
fact
that
this
treaty
may
break
down
nato
jens
stoltenberg
told
reporters
nato
foreign
ministers
agreed
to
formally
declare
russia
in
material
breach
of
the
inf
treaty
in
a
statement
in
support
of
the
united
states
after
pompeo
briefed
them
at
the
alliance
headquarters
in
brussels
on
russian
violations
and
on
president
donald
trump
s
stated
aim
to
withdraw
from
it
russia
denies
undertaking
any
such
development
of
cruise
missile
capable
of
carrying
nuclear
warheads
and
hitting
european
cities
at
short
notice
germany
the
netherlands
and
belgian
are
concerned
about
the
deployment
of
missiles
in
europe
as
happened
in
the
touching
off
large
demonstrations
while
being
caught
up
in
nuclear
competition
between
moscow
and
washington
a
exit
from
the
inf
treaty
would
put
another
strain
on
nato
allies
already
shaken
by
trump
s
demands
for
higher
defence
spending
and
what
diplomats
say
is
a
lack
of
clarity
about
where
strategy
is
heading
on
the
issue
while
stoltenberg
said
there
would
now
be
an
intense
diplomatic
push
to
try
to
convince
russia
to
give
up
what
pompeo
said
were
multiple
battalions
of
the
missiles
washington
is
set
to
start
to
pull
out
in
february
prompting
a
withdrawal
period
under
the
accord
diplomats
said
its
range
makes
it
a
direct
menace
to
europe
pompeo
said
of
the
missiles
which
also
are
called
novator
he
added
that
russia
s
actions
greatly
undermine
america
s
national
security
and
that
of
our
allies
difficult
to
detect
and
fired
from
mobile
launchers
the
russian
missiles
are
especially
dangerous
because
they
reduce
the
warning
time
that
nato
air
defences
might
have
to
shoot
them
down
military
experts
say
pompeo
said
the
government
had
raised
the
issue
at
least
times
since
with
moscow
but
had
faced
what
he
said
were
denials
and
he
also
said
that
the
united
states
had
evidence
that
the
test
launches
were
from
a
single
site
in
russia
the
base
kupustin
yar
near
volgograd
southeast
of
moscow
in
the
light
of
these
facts
the
united
states
declares
russia
in
material
breach
of
the
treaty
and
will
suspend
our
obligations
effective
in
days
unless
russia
returns
to
full
and
verifiable
compliance
pompeo
said
washington
has
said
it
would
be
forced
to
restore
the
military
balance
in
europe
after
the
period
but
pompeo
declined
to
elaborate
saying
only
that
tests
and
deployments
of
new
missiles
were
on
hold
until
then
he
also
said
that
because
china
iran
and
north
korea
were
not
signatories
to
the
inf
the
united
states
was
putting
itself
at
a
disadvantage
by
not
developing
missiles
citing
three
failed
diplomatic
attempts
to
enlarge
the
treaty
however
experts
believe
the
united
states
would
be
better
off
modernising
its
missile
deterrent
and
ensuring
that
it
could
penetrate
sophisticated
russian
air
defences
rather
than
developing
a
new
class
of
rockets
the
inf
treaty
negotiated
by
ronald
reagan
and
soviet
leader
mikhail
gorbachev
and
ratified
by
the
senate
eliminated
the
missile
arsenals
of
the
world
s
two
biggest
nuclear
powers
and
reduced
their
ability
to
launch
a
nuclear
strike
at
short
notice
cruise
and
pershing
missiles
deployed
in
britain
and
west
germany
were
removed
as
a
result
of
the
treaty
while
the
soviet
union
pulled
back
its
out
of
european
range
the
treaty
requires
the
united
states
and
russia
not
to
possess
produce
or
a
cruise
missile
with
a
range
capability
of
km
to
km
miles
or
to
possess
or
produce
launchers
