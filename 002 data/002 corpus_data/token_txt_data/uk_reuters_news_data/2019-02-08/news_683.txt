for trump supporters, elections a battle to protect a leader under siege
cleveland
reuters
for
many
americans
tuesday
s
congressional
midterm
elections
are
a
referendum
on
republican
president
donald
trump
s
divisive
persona
policies
and
pugnacious
politics
but
on
the
eve
of
the
election
in
a
packed
airport
hangar
in
cleveland
and
at
other
trump
rallies
across
the
nation
the
stakes
are
different
a
vote
to
protect
a
leader
they
see
as
under
siege
whose
inflammatory
rhetoric
is
a
necessary
price
for
a
era
of
change
you
think
we
re
letting
that
caravan
come
into
this
country
trump
asked
the
crowd
on
monday
referring
to
a
group
of
central
american
migrants
moving
through
mexico
toward
the
border
no
his
supporters
shouted
at
rallies
overflowing
with
mostly
white
supporters
in
conservative
pockets
of
the
country
those
backing
trump
say
they
hope
to
make
his
ideas
the
dominant
force
in
american
political
life
for
decades
to
come
they
face
strong
headwinds
nationally
about
percent
of
americans
disapprove
of
trump
s
performance
more
people
say
they
would
vote
for
a
democratic
candidate
than
a
republican
in
tuesday
s
congressional
elections
polling
shows
but
republicans
are
eager
to
defy
expectations
just
as
the
president
did
with
his
victory
in
grand
rapids
michigan
activist
ben
hirschmann
sees
tuesday
s
elections
as
decisive
for
trump
s
vision
of
america
trump
s
not
on
the
ballot
but
he
is
on
the
ballot
he
said
at
a
event
to
get
out
the
vote
at
the
local
republican
headquarters
everything
we
voted
for
in
is
on
the
line
in
trump
embarked
on
a
tour
in
the
midwest
on
monday
holding
rallies
in
ohio
indiana
and
missouri
he
has
a
clear
strategy
drive
republican
turnout
by
painting
a
dark
apocalyptic
vision
of
life
in
america
under
democrats
while
fanning
fears
over
illegal
immigration
he
casts
his
rivals
as
an
angry
liberal
and
dangerous
mob
and
plays
up
gains
in
the
economy
democrats
produce
mobs
republicans
produce
jobs
trump
said
in
cleveland
repeating
a
familiar
line
from
his
rallies
but
as
the
frequency
of
his
speeches
and
rallies
increases
so
too
have
his
distortions
and
falsehoods
according
to
the
washington
post
s
fact
checker
database
in
the
seven
weeks
before
tuesday
s
elections
trump
averaged
false
or
misleading
claims
a
day
up
from
an
average
of
five
a
day
during
his
first
nine
months
in
office
trump
frequently
denies
that
he
misleads
the
public
and
instead
blames
the
media
for
what
he
describes
as
distortions
of
his
words
it
is
unclear
whether
trump
s
campaign
strategy
will
work
republicans
are
expected
to
keep
control
of
the
senate
but
democrats
are
widely
favoured
to
win
the
seats
they
need
to
assume
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
republican
party
is
defending
dozens
of
seats
in
largely
suburban
districts
where
trump
s
popularity
has
languished
and
democrats
have
performed
well
in
presidential
races
trump
s
rallies
have
focussed
mostly
on
senate
and
gubernatorial
battles
in
states
he
won
in
the
white
house
race
from
florida
and
missouri
to
west
virginia
and
ohio
a
trump
adviser
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
told
reuters
these
are
places
where
data
and
polling
information
tells
us
that
the
president
is
of
best
at
a
rally
in
johnson
city
tennessee
in
early
october
jessica
lotz
and
her
fiance
chad
lavery
said
trump
s
immigration
policies
resonated
with
them
during
the
economic
downturn
lotz
and
lavery
said
they
saw
construction
landscaping
and
jobs
go
to
illegal
immigrants
while
they
struggled
financially
as
the
economy
rebounded
so
too
did
their
fortunes
now
we
re
living
good
lavery
said
crediting
their
ability
to
find
work
and
better
wages
to
trump
who
inherited
an
economy
that
was
already
in
one
of
its
longest
recoveries
and
gave
it
an
additional
boost
with
tax
cuts
after
a
trump
rally
in
september
in
springfield
missouri
activist
brenda
webb
sat
for
a
late
dinner
at
a
restaurant
with
five
friends
who
had
driven
to
the
rally
from
the
louis
suburbs
webb
and
her
friends
had
joined
protests
against
democratic
barack
obama
in
louis
in
that
were
part
of
a
broader
conservative
tea
party
movement
centred
on
calls
for
smaller
government
lower
taxes
and
fewer
regulations
but
the
energy
fizzled
she
said
the
group
became
animated
talking
about
how
trump
had
given
new
focus
to
those
early
tea
party
goals
of
reclaiming
government
for
ordinary
citizens
not
just
the
elites
in
washington
we
feel
like
he
s
working
to
resolve
all
the
problems
that
we
are
so
frustrated
by
webb
said
at
the
springfield
rally
brian
whorton
who
drove
a
few
hours
to
see
the
president
said
he
voted
for
obama
in
and
before
becoming
a
republican
i
was
not
politically
aware
and
awake
i
thought
oh
he
s
cool
and
he
s
a
good
speaker
and
an
guy
said
whorton
who
is
white
trump
s
policies
he
said
were
making
a
difference
for
him
he
said
his
manager
at
an
aluminium
electrical
wire
factory
had
credited
trump
tariffs
with
raising
their
profits
he
is
putting
people
back
to
work
said
retired
postal
worker
barbara
peacock
as
she
leafed
through
trump
merchandise
at
his
rally
in
macon
georgia
on
sunday
he
is
telling
it
like
it
in
ohio
republican
national
committee
spokeswoman
mandi
merritt
referred
to
enthusiasts
as
a
grassroots
army
that
could
be
harnessed
and
dispatched
to
boost
republican
voter
turnout
on
a
sunny
day
in
october
trump
supporter
kimmy
kolkovich
joined
a
friend
on
the
sidewalk
at
a
busy
intersection
near
the
ohio
statehouse
in
columbus
to
urge
people
to
register
and
vote
even
if

people
who
are
going
to

for
the
other
party
they
