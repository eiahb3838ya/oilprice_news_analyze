faced
with
the
advancing
age
of
the
suspects
germany
has
stepped
up
prosecutions
of
individuals
since
the
conviction
of
john
demjanjuk
a
guard
at
sobibor
death
camp
that
case
established
a
new
precedent
that
no
proof
of
a
specific
crime
was
needed
to
convict
a
defendant
in
recent
years
some
other
former
ss
camp
guards
have
been
convicted
but
died
either
before
the
conviction
was
legally
binding
or
before
they
had
to
go
behind
bars
