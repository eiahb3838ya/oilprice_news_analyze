a

about
human

undermine

a

a

riyadh

action
may
do
some
damage
to

it

but
the
row
raises
question
marks
more
broadly
for
the
foreign

riyadh
is
counting
on
to
become
partners
to
the
tune
of
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
in
the
modernisation
of
the
arab
world
s
biggest

crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
widely
known
as
mbs
has
made
a
strong
pitch
for
foreign
capital
since
rising
to
power
in
spearheading
an
ambitious
economic
and
privatisation
plan
that
included
the
future

unstable

costly

arrests

high
international
profile
critics
said
the
spat
risks
slowing
a
faltering
foreign
investment
drive
inflows
have
slowed
mainly
due
to
years
of
low
oil
prices
but
regional
turbulence
doesn
t
help
they
say
saudi
arabia
simply
can
not
afford
to
alienate
any
other
sections
of
the
global
community

the

prominent

commentator
jamal
khashoggi
wrote
in
the
washington
post
most
importantly
saudi
arabia
s
economic
transformation
requires
more
friends
than
enemies
mbs
he
wrote
needs
to
use
ways
and
means
that
investors
are
accustomed
to
if
business
executives
fear
a
backlash
over
any
possible
criticism
regarding
their
investment
the
new
vision
of
saudi
arabia
would
be
in
serious
the
kingdom
insists
it
is
justified
in
punishing
ottawa
for
its
public
appeal
over
the
activists
a
statement
decried
a
blatant
interference
in
the
kingdom

domestic
affairs
against
basic
international
norms
and
all
international
foreign
minister
adel
on
wednesday
ruled
out
mediation
and
said
riyadh
might
take
more
measures
but
for
some
the
canada
row
strengthens
an
impression
of
impulsive
germany
for
example
found
itself
in
hot
water
last
year
after
appearing
to
criticise
riyadh
s
ties
with
lebanon
the
kingdom
reacted
by
moving
to
exclude
german
companies
from
government
contracts
it
risks
suggesting
that
policymakers
may
be
backsliding
on
some
of
the
recent
measures
to
open
up
the
economy
and
that
policymaking
can
be
quite
arbitrary
this
might
hurt
investment
into
the

last

in
riyadh
which
mbs
wants
to
make

regional

powerhouse
within
days
the
euphoria
of
the
event
was
dampened
by
the
severity
and
secrecy
of
an
crackdown
that
saw
the

from

the

isn

so
much
about

as
the
way
in
which
saudi
arabia
in
a
world
of
mobile
global
capital
responds
to

in
saudi

exported
billion
worth
of
goods

to

less
than
one
percent
of
saudi
arabia
s
total
world
exports
of
billion
over
the
same
period
while
canada
s
exports
were
even
lower
it
is
unclear
how
far
the
row
will
affect
that
activity
although
the
suspension
of

exchange
programmes
with

may
affect
thousands
of
saudi

cost
canadian

millions

is
uncertain

are
entering
