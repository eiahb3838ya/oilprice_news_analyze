paris
reuters
renault
requested
a
full
nissan
shareholder
meeting
a
source
close
to
the
company
said
appearing
to
escalate
the
carmaker
s
standoff
with
its
japanese
alliance
partner
in
the
wake
of
the
pay
scandal
engulfing
chairman
and
ceo
carlos
ghosn
thierry
bollore
the
french
group
s
deputy
ceo
issued
the
demand
in
a
letter
to
nissan
the
source
said
on
sunday
confirming
a
report
in
the
wall
street
journal
we
respectfully
ask
that
the
board
consider
calling
an
extraordinary
general
meeting
of
nissan
shareholders
as
promptly
as
practicable
bollore
wrote
in
the
letter
a
renault
spokesman
declined
to
comment
ghosn
s
arrest
in
japan
for
alleged
financial
misconduct
has
shaken
the
alliance
with
nissan
ceo
hiroto
saikawa
calling
for
changes
to
weaken
renault
s
control
renault
owns
percent
of
nissan
whose
reciprocal
percent
stake
in
its
french
parent
carries
no
voting
rights
nissan
in
turn
controls
mitsubishi
via
a
percent
holding
the
call
for
a
shareholder
meeting
will
likely
be
seen
as
an
attempted
show
of
force
by
renault
s
interim
management
led
by
bollore
and
mouna
sepehri
ghosn
s
chief
of
staff
who
also
heads
legal
affairs
and
communications
the
letter
made
no
mention
of
using
the
shareholder
meeting
to
hire
or
fire
nissan
board
members
but
remained
vague
about
its
purpose
saying
only
that
it
would
allow
for
appropriate
disclosure
and
discussion
of
governance
and
other
matters
it
added
that
the
indictment
of
nissan
creates
significant
risks
to
renault
as
nissan
s
largest
shareholder
and
to
the
stability
of
our
industrial
alliance
