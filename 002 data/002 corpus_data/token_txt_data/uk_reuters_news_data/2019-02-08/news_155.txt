european power firms aim to harness electric car batteries
reuters
ever
wanted
to
run
your
electric
car
for
free
if
you
re
open
to
a
bit
of
give
and
take
then
stay
plugged
in
and
your
wishes
might
come
true
at
least
that
s
what
some
european
power
companies
and
japanese
carmakers
believe
and
edf
are
already
working
with
nissan
to
develop
services
that
allow
power
stored
in
electric
vehicle
batteries
to
be
sold
back
to
the
grid
and
now
they
re
trying
to
persuade
european
carmakers
to
follow
suit
with
millions
of
electric
cars
expected
on
european
roads
over
the
next
decade
utility
firms
see
both
an
opportunity
to
sell
drivers
more
electricity
and
a
risk
that
surges
in
charging
at
peak
times
could
destabilise
stressed
power
grids
that
s
why
is
working
with
nissan
to
develop
services
including
software
for
aggregating
and
marketing
charging
data
so
the
german
power
company
can
predict
peaks
and
troughs
in
electricity
demand
nissan
s
idea
is
that
if
you
charge
your
electric
vehicle
ev
at
times
and
are
prepared
to
sell
power
back
to
the
grid
when
it
s
under
strain
you
could
effectively
charge
for
free
french
utility
edf
has
teamed
up
with
san
technology
specialist
nuvve
to
build
the
first
charging
network
in
europe
for
vehicles
made
by
japan
nissan
and
mitsubishi
europe
s
biggest
utility
by
market
value
italy
s
enel
has
also
worked
with
nissan
and
nuvve
on
pilots
in
denmark
and
the
netherlands
as
well
as
in
rome
and
genoa
the
problem
for
the
utilities
is
that
unlike
nissan
the
french
and
german
firms
that
will
make
most
of
the
electric
cars
expected
on
europe
s
road
in
coming
years
are
not
playing
ball
at
least
for
now
and
edf
are
talking
to
european
carmakers
about
taking
seriously
according
to
two
industry
sources
but
they
are
more
focused
on
ev
charging
technology
that
the
sources
say
is
less
suited
to
flows
than
japanese
standards
ionity
a
joint
venture
of
volkswagen
daimler
bmw
and
ford
said
it
did
not
see
an
initial
case
for
in
its
drive
to
install
charging
stations
across
europe
to
facilitate
journeys
our
clients
want
to
charge
fast
and
not
feed
back
in
a
spokesman
for
ionity
said
only
in
combination
with
an
external
storage
system
would
a
use
case
possibly
be
the
other
big
holdout
is
ev
pioneer
tesla
which
also
sells
large
stationary
batteries
for
home
power
storage
tesla
declined
to
comment
on
the
idea
of
using
millions
of
ev
batteries
as
large
virtual
power
plants
to
put
power
back
into
the
grid
has
been
around
for
years
though
the
concept
is
still
mostly
at
the
pilot
phase
mainly
because
there
are
very
few
evs
on
the
roads
now
but
its
appeal
to
the
power
industry
is
obvious
with
a
typical
car
driving
less
than
percent
of
the
day
the
rest
of
the
time
car
batteries
could
be
used
to
balance
out
demand
and
supply
swings
in
energy
networks
that
increasingly
need
to
juggle
intermittent
solar
and
wind
power
that
s
the
case
in
germany
in
particular
as
it
is
phasing
out
baseload
nuclear
and
plants
unlike
france
and
japan
which
are
sticking
with
nuclear
to
ensure
a
secure
supply

jonathan
tudor
director
of
technology
strategy
at
the
innovation
division
of
britain
s
biggest
utility
centrica
said
will
be
part
of
the
mix
of
technologies
stabilising
networks
once
more
evs
hit
the
road
winding
the
clock
forward
years
if
consumer
behaviour
stays
the
same
we
will
see
thousands
of
people
arriving
home
and
wanting
to
charge
up
their
cars
at
the
time
that
is
already
peak
demand
for
most
countries
he
said
alberto
piglia
global
head
of
at
enel
said
as
the
ev
market
grows
exponentially
there
will
be
a
tipping
point
at
which
there
will
be
an
explosion
of
related
energy
services
we
are
preparing
the
world
for
one
major
hurdle
for
the
of
in
europe
is
that
for
now
it
only
works
well
with
the
ev
charging
standard
developed
in
japan
known
as
chademo
the
ionity
joint
venture
meanwhile
is
focused
on
establishing
the
combined
charging
system
ccs
plug
as
the
industry
standard
but
experts
say
the
communication
protocol
between
ccs
chargers
and
ev
batteries
is
not
being
set
up
currently
in
way
that
allows
rapid
changes
in
information
flows
to
charge
and
discharge
electricity
rather
ccs
is
being
developed
so
ev
owners
can
charge
vehicles
as
fast
as
possible
to
encourage
the
acceptance
of
electric
cars
by
drivers
reluctant
to
give
up
the
convenience
of
quickly
filling
up
vehicles
with
gas
we
are
missing
a
charging
standard
said
gregory
poilasne
chief
executive
of
nuvve
the
network
of
charging
stations
it
is
developing
with
edf
in
britain
and
france
will
only
be
used
for
now
with
corporate
fleets
of
nissan
leaf
utility
vans
and
mitsubishi
outlanders
running
on
the
chademo
standard
that
s
why
nuvve
is
also
in
talks
with
french
and
other
carmakers
about
making
ccs
compatible
with
china
the
world
s
biggest
market
for
evs
also
has
in
mind
china
s
own
standard
is
not
well
suited
to
but
the
china
electricity
council
struck
an
agreement
with
the
japan
s
chademo
association
last
year
to
develop
a
common
plug
that
should
handle
rapid
flows
but
at
a
time
when
global
infrastructure
standards
for
evs
have
yet
to
be
established
german
carmakers
are
reluctant
to
give
up
on
the
technology
they
have
invested
in
nor
cede
too
much
control
over
their
vehicle
components
to
utility
firms
something
effectively
requires
them
to
do

plug
wars
the
battle
for
electric
car
supremacy
still
despite
making
little
headway
so
far
hopes
that
the
ccs
standard
will
become
part
of
the
mix
the
technology
for
aggregation
and
marketing
that
we
re
developing
at
based
on
the
chademo
standard
will
also
be
applicable
to
the
ccs
standard
said
johannes
werhahn
s
head
of
flexibility
renewables
marketing
and
storage
solutions
ovo
energy
a
challenger
to
britain
big
six
power
retailers
is
also
eyeing
ccs
as
a
market
for
the
charger
it
launched
last
year
in
a
deal
with
nissan
we
are
very
close
partners
with
nissan
but
we
do
expect
to
work
with
other
car
manufacturers
in
future
including
those
that
use
ccs
said
tom
pakenham
ovo
s
head
of
evs
centrica
invested
in
israeli
ev
software
charging
firm
driivz
last
year
and
said
part
of
the
deal
would
involve
developing
technology
once
the
software
is
integrated
and
we
understand
what
needs
to
be
done
we
will
look
to
start
trials
likely
sometime
in
the
next
months
tudor
said
one
catch
for
proponents
is
that
constantly
charging
and
discharging
is
widely
perceived
to
be
the
fastest
way
to
shorten
the
life
span
of
a
battery
the
most
expensive
component
in
an
ev
usually
accounting
for
about
a
third
of
its
cost
analysts
say
persuading
consumers
that
makes
economic
sense
and
doesn
t
disrupt
their
daily
lives
will
be
crucial
nissan
though
is
convinced
will
change
the
rules
of
the
game
once
consumers
can
be
offered
a
service
that
will
effectively
mean
they
can
charge
vehicles
for
free
japan
s
honda
also
plans
to
incorporate
capability
when
it
launches
its
first
ev
in
europe
this
year
nuvve
s
poilasne
said
could
reduce
the
total
cost
of
ev
ownership
by
about
percent
without
ruining
the
battery
though
earnings
from
services
would
be
greater
in
countries
with
a
larger
share
of
intermittent
renewable
energy
