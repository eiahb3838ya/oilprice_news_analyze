on
four
myanmar

against
rohingya
muslims
and
widespread
human

abuses
across
the
southeast
asian

the
sanctions
by
the

marked
the
toughest
action
so
far
in
response
to
myanmar
s
crackdown
on
the
rohingya
minority
which
started
last
year
and
has
driven
more
than
people
into
neighbouring
bangladesh
and
left
thousands
of
dead
behind
but
the
trump
administration
did
not
target
the
highest
levels
of
myanmar
s
military
and
also
stopped
short
of
calling
the
campaign
crimes
against
humanity
or
genocide
which
has
been
the
subject
of
debate
within
the
government
the
measures
were
announced

state
mike
pompeo

to

to
issue
the
findings
of
an
intensive

of
alleged
atrocities
by

against
the

of
the

compiled
from

at
refugee
camps
in
bangladesh
is
expected
to
be
around
the
august
anniversary
of
the
bloody
crackdown

forces
have
engaged
in
violent
campaigns
against
ethnic
minority
communities
across

using
an
alternative
name
for

treasury
is
sanctioning
units
and
leaders
overseeing
this
horrific
behaviour
as
part
of
a
broader
government
strategy
to
hold
accountable
those
responsible
for
such
human
suffering
mandelker
said
the
sanctions
were
imposed
on

in

to
the

light

divisions
the
measures
call
for
freezes
of
any
assets
the
individuals
hold
a
prohibition
on
americans
doing
business
with
them
as
well
as
bans
on
travel
to
the
united

a
reuters
special
report
in

gave
a
comprehensive
account
of
the
roles
played
by
the
two
infantry
divisions
in
the
offensive
against
the
rohingya
the
military
in
myanmar
also
known
as
burma
has
denied
accusations
of
ethnic
cleansing
and
says
its
actions
were
part
of
a
fight
against
terrorism
myanmar
s
embassy
in
washington
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
critics
have
accused
president
donald
trump
of
being
slow
in
his
response
to
the
rohingya
crisis
human

while

rich
weir
myanmar
researcher
at
human
rights
watch
called
the
sanctions
an
important
but
long
overdue
the
avoidance
of
the
top
military
leaders
is
striking
he
added
the
likelihood
that
they
did
not
know
what
was
happening
is
close
to
in
the
treasury
statement
mandelker
said
the
government
is
committed
to
ensuring
that
burmese
military
units
and
leaders
reckon
with
and
put
a
stop
to
these
brutal
in
november
following
the
lead
of
the
united
nations
and
the
european
union
of
state
rex
tillerson
declared
that
the
rohingya
crisis
constituted
ethnic
cleansing
a
designation
that
increased
pressure
on
its
civilian
leader
nobel
peace
laureate
aung
san
suu
kyi
pompeo
has
yet
to
decide
whether
once
he
releases
the
state
department
s
rohingya
atrocities
report
to
ratchet
up
characterization
of
the
violence
as
crimes
against
humanity
or
genocide
or
to
avoid
any
such
label
the
officials
told
reuters
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
such
terms
could
commit
the
united
states
to
stronger
punitive
measures
or
help
set
the
stage
for
charges
at
the
international
criminal
court
in
the
hague
some
within
the
administration
worry
that
this
could
complicate
suu
kyi
s
relationship
with
the
powerful
military
and
push
myanmar
closer
to
china
washington
s
regional
rival
until
friday

announcement
the
united

had
only
sanctioned
a
single
myanmar

scaled
back
bilateral
military
ties
on
friday
senator
maria
cantwell
a
democrat
from
washington
state
called
on
social
media
companies
to
better
protect
vulnerable
communities
by
regulating
hate
speech
on
their
platforms
citing
a
reuters
report
that
found
more
than
examples
of
content
published
on
facebook
that
attacked
the
rohingya
and
other
muslims
in
myanmar
here
facebook
and
other
technology
companies
must
find
the
means
to
address
these
problems
head
on
and
invest
in
solutions

cantwell
in
a
