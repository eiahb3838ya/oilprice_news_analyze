count
totals
trump
alleged

provided
no

the
florida

should
be
called
in
favour
of
rick
scott

ron
desantis
in
that
large
numbers
of
new
ballots
showed
up
out
of
nowhere
and
many

are
missing
or
forged
an
honest
vote
count
is
no
longer
massively
infected
must
go
with
election
night
he
wrote
studies
have
found
no
evidence
of
voter
fraud
in
the
united
states
although
courts
have
found
evidence
through
the
nation
s
history
of
policies
intended
to
suppress
voting
by
minorities
the
fact
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
fraud
