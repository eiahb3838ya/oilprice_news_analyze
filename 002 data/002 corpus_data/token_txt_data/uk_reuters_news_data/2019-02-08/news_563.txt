riyadh

complicating
president

four
prominent

international
the

and
reporters
without
borders
last
month
urged
turkey
to
ask
the
united
nations
to
investigate
the
disappearance
of
khashoggi
they
say
a
precedent
was
set
for
such
a
move
in
when
pakistan
asked
then
ban
to
establish
an
international
inquiry
into
the
assassination
of
prime
minister
benazir
bhutto
ban
consulted
pakistani
officials
and
members
of
the
security
council
he
then
notified
the
council
in
of
his
intention
to
establish
an
inquiry
and
was
given
informal
approval
by
the
body
to
do
so
in
a
letter
the
secretary
general
does
not
have
the
authority
to
do
it
an
investigation
without
a
mandate
given
to
him
by
a
legislative
body
spokesman
dujarric
said
on
friday
citing
as
examples
the
security
council
or
the
human
rights
council
dujarric
said
that
if
a
country
made
a
formal
request
for
an
inquiry
into
khashoggi
s
death
we
would
obviously
have
to
study
the
content
of
that
