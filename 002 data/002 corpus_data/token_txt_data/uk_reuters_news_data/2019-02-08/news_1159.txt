london
reuters
britain
s
finance
ministry
is
in
talks
with
the
bank
of
england
over
whether
governor
mark
carney
is
willing
to
stay
beyond
his
planned
departure
date
of
june
next
year
amid
difficulties
finding
a
successor
the
bbc
reported
on
monday
carney
originally
planned
to
serve
just
five
years
of
a
maximum
term
as
governor
but
in
october
he
agreed
to
stay
an
extra
year
until
mid
to
see
britain
past
its
expected
departure
from
the
european
union
now
it
appears
he
is
being
asked
to
delay
his
departure
again
albeit
possibly
by
less
than
a
year
the
bbc
said
without
citing
a
specific
source
i
understand
that
the
treasury
is
concerned
that
trying
to
complete
a
process
to
find
a
new
governor
now
in
the
teeth
of
the
brexit
negotiations
would
be
difficult
the
bbc
s
economics
editor
kamal
ahmed
wrote
however
it
has
been
made
clear
to
me
that
no
deal
has
been
agreed
and
the
extension
might
be
much
less
than
a
year
if
it
happens
he
added
a
spokesman
for
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
said
there
had
been
no
change
to
the
finance
ministry
s
plan
to
start
a
formal
search
for
carney
s
successor
the
governor
has
said
that
he
intends
to
step
down
in
june
and
the
treasury
has
said
they
will
start
recruiting
for
a
new
governor
in
due
course
and
that
is
still
the
plan
he
told
reporters
earlier
on
monday
the
financial
times
cited
people
close
to
the
governor
as
saying
carney
would
be
willing
to
serve
more
of
his
term
than
he
had
previously
stated
the
boe
declined
to
comment
on
the
bbc
and
ft
reports
carney
is
due
to
appear
before
a
parliament
committee
for
a
regular
hearing
on
tuesday
when
he
is
likely
to
be
asked
about
his
future
plans
the
to
succeed
carney
is
widely
seen
to
be
andrew
bailey
the
chief
executive
of
britain
s
financial
conduct
authority
and
a
former
deputy
governor
at
the
boe
however
earlier
this
year
finance
minister
philip
hammond
said
he
might
look
abroad
again
for
a
successor
to
carney
the
announcement
of
carney
s
appointment
in
came
as
a
surprise
as
carney
had
previously
denied
interest
in
the
role
and
the
governor
paul
tucker
had
been
seen
as
the
favorite
for
the
role
