japan
will
put
issues
ranging
from
global
trade
imbalances
to
the
impact
of
ageing
populations
on
the
agenda
when
it
chairs
next
year
s
meetings
of
leaders
from
the
group
of
major
economies
government
officials
said
at
the
end
of
the
summit
in
buenos
aires
finance
minister
taro
aso
unveiled
the
priority
issues
to
be
taken
up
by
his
counterparts
and
central
bank
governors
next
year
when
japan
takes
over
the
chairmanship
from
argentina
japan
will
host
a
financial
leaders
meeting
in
fukuoka
in
western
japan
on
june
followed
by
a
leaders
summit
in
osaka
on
june
tokyo
will
assert
that
global
current
account
imbalances
should
be
fixed
via
multilateral
policy
coordination
rather
than
bilateral
trade
deals
the
officials
said
they
declined
to
be
identified
because
they
are
not
authorized
to
talk
to
the
media
excessive
imbalances
should
be
adjusted
by
improving
the
ratio
of
investment
and
saving
through
macroeconomic
policy
and
structural
reform
they
added
global
imbalances
had
once
been
a
key
topic
at
meetings
with
a
focus
on
each
country
s
current
account
balance
or
the
overall
flow
of
money
including
but
not
confined
to
trade
this
approach
runs
counter
to
president
donald
trump
s
focus
on
narrowing
the
trade
deficit
using
import
tariffs
and
bilateral
deals
his
america
first
policies
and
the
trade
war
have
overshadowed
debates
at
recent
meetings
japan
s
plans
underscore
tokyo
s
view
that
instead
of
focussing
too
much
on
bilateral
trade
imbalances
there
should
be
more
emphasis
on
overall
capital
flows
and
structural
factors
behind
the
deficit
such
as
a
lack
of
domestic
savings
saddled
with
its
own
ageing
population
and
the
industrial
world
s
heaviest
public
debt
burden
japan
will
also
highlight
the
issue
of
ageing
and
its
impact
on
fiscal
and
monetary
policies
at
next
year
s
meetings
the
officials
said
bank
of
japan
governor
haruhiko
kuroda
has
said
an
ageing
population
could
pose
serious
challenges
for
central
banks
as
it
undercuts
economies
growth
potential
and
requires
them
to
use
more
monetary
firepower
than
before
to
boost
growth
also
on
the
agenda
under
japan
s
chair
will
be
the
need
to
ensure
debt
sustainability
given
rising
debt
in
countries
and
to
promote
infrastructure
