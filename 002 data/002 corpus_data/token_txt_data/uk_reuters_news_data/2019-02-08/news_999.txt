jeremy
hunt
had
told
bbc

on

that
if
eu
leaders
expected
the

then
they

profoundly
misjudged
the
british

even
if
that
meant
leaving
the
bloc
next

without
a
deal
we
may
be
polite
but
we
have
a
bottom
line

and
so
they
need

engage
with
us
now

initial
reactions
from
across
the
english
channel

france
and
germany
were
digging
in
too
eu

european
affairs
nathalie
loiseau
said

a
no
deal
outcome
she
said
on
france
info
radio
that
britain
s
vote
to

german
deputy
foreign
minister
michael
roth
said
on
twitter
the
other
eu
states
were
striving
to
achieve
reasonable
solutions
and
that
the
blame
game
against
the
eu
was
more
than
unfair
in
london
the
daily
telegraph
reported

the
prospect
of
ministerial
resignations
next
week
if
she

plan
that
she
presented
in
austria
the
sunday
telegraph
said
party
donor
jeremy
hosking
was
mulling
backing
a
new
party
but
domestically
even
some
critics
of
may
s
plan
backed
the
prime
minister
in
her
standoff
against
the
eu
i
have
a
serious
difference
of
opinion
with
our
prime
minister
but
even
so
i
have
to
tell
you
that
i
view
the
behaviour
of
the
european
union
leaders
in
salzburg
with
contempt
david
davis
the
former
brexit
minister
who
resigned
in
protest
at
chequers
said
in
a
speech
at
a
leave
means
leave
rally
in
the
northern
english
town
of

disrespect
our
prime
minister
and
you
disrespect
our
after
may
s
friday
statement
european
council
president
donald
tusk
said
the
results
of
the
eu
s
analysis
of
that
plan
had
been
known
to
britain
for
many
weeks
but
hunt
said
there
was
a
difference
between
rhetoric
and
substance
on
the
substance
of
the
chequers
proposals
we
have
not
had
a
detailed
response
he
said
adding
that
eu
proposals
for
the
irish
border
would
mean
that
it
was
impossible
to
leave
the
eu
intact
as
one
country
may
has
accepted
the
need
for
a
backstop
insurance
policy
on
the
irish
border
but
says
the
eu
s
version
of
the
proposal
would
see
northern
ireland
carved
off
from
the
united
kingdom
the
eu
says
may
s
proposal
keeping
the
province
and
mainland
britain
in
the
same
regulatory
space
undermines
the
single
market
despite
the
differences
irish
foreign
minister
simon
coveney
told
rte
radio
an
irish
backstop
was
doable
by
an
october
summit
hunt
said
britain
wanted
a
deal
but
would
be
able
to
withstand
a
brexit
it
would
be
bumpy
it
would
be
difficult
but
we
would
find
a
way
to
survive
and
prosper
as
a
country
he
said
we
ve
had
far
bigger
challenges
in
our
should
may
get
a
deal
opposition
labour
party
leader
jeremy
corbyn
said
he
would
not
support
it
unless
it
protected
jobs
and
living
standards
the
independent
reported
that
corbyn
would
try
and
force
a
general
election
within
days
if
lawmakers
reject
the
brexit
deal
we
will
challenge
this
government
on
whatever
deal
it
brings
back
corbyn
told
a
rally
in
liverpool
northern
england
on
the
eve
of
labour
s
annual
conference
and
if
this
government
can
t
deliver
then
i
simply
say
to

best
way
to
settle
