taiwan
objects
to
britain
s
proposed
rules
for
managing
its
trade
in
services
after
it
leaves
the
european
union
and
has
requested
negotiations
at
the
world
trade
organization
according
to
a
document
seen
by
reuters
on
wednesday
britain
voted
in
a
referendum
in
to
leave
the
eu
which
has
spoken
for
britain
on
trade
matters
ever
since
the
wto
was
founded
in
as
part
of
the
brexit
divorce
britain
needs
its
own
wto
membership
texts
known
as
schedules
to
set
out
how
it
will
treat
its
trading
partners
in
goods
and
services
last
month
britain
formally
submitted
its
proposed
new
services
schedule
to
the
wto
trade
minister
liam
fox
said
the
process
would
replicate
existing
arrangements
as
far
as
possible
and
was
only
a
technical
exercise
in
a
document
circulated
to
other
wto
members
on
wednesday
taiwan
raised
objections
saying
the
new
text
made
more
than
purely
technical
changes
taipei
looked
forward
to
entering
into
consultations
expeditiously
with
the
united
kingdom
in
order
to
reach
a
satisfactory
resolution
to
this
matter
it
cited
eight
sections
where
it
had
objections
mainly
clauses
that
were
no
longer
relevant
or
necessary
but
in
financial
services
and
aircraft
leasing
and
rental
taiwan
said
the
new
schedule
would
leave
it
with
less
market
access
than
it
had
previously
current
european
union
commitments
require
european
union
member
states
to
allow
airlines
to
lease
aircraft
registered
anywhere
in
the
european
union
however
the
united
kingdom
has
changed
this
obligation
to
require
united
kingdom
airlines
to
lease
aircraft
registered
in
the
united
kingdom
it
said
this
appears
to
reduce
market
access
as
the
scope
of
where
aircraft
may
be
registered
has
been
reduced
the
united
kingdom
should
delete
this
similarly
in
financial
services
there
were
several
areas
where
the
eu
schedule
included
a
requirement
for
establishment
in
the
eu
taiwan
said
the
united
kingdom
changed
eu
to
uk
for
these
entries
in
its
draft
schedule
this
would
appear
to
reduce
market
access
as
it
reduces
the
geographical
scope
of
if
taiwan
and
potentially
other
wto
members
press
britain
for
improvements
to
the
text
fox
may
need
to
offer
them
compensation
by
opening
up
trade
in
other
areas
although
any
such
liberalisation
would
apply
across
the
wto
britain
is
facing
similar
objections
to
its
goods
schedule
with
widespread
dissatisfaction
among
agricultural
suppliers
failing
to
reach
rapid
agreement
may
be
a
bureaucratic
headache
and
add
to
criticism
of
the
brexit
process
but
it
will
not
affect
the
brexit
timetable
many
wto
members
trade
without
finalised
schedules
on
the
understanding
that
they
are
trying
in
good
faith
to
reach
an
agreement
in
the
meantime
