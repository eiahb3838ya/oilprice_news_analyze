uk retail needs internet tax 'shock', says sports direct boss
london
reuters
the
british
government
should
levy
a
tax
on
retailers
with
online
sales
accounting
for
more
than
percent
of
revenue
to
save
traditional
shopping
districts
the
billionaire
boss
of
sports
direct
told
lawmakers
on
monday
mike
ashley
said
the
move
would
be
a
massive
electric
shock
for
the
sector
encouraging
retailers
to
invest
in
physical
stores
you
have
to
tax
the
internet
for
the
good
of
the
high
street
the
good
of
the
all
ashley
told
the
lower
house
of
parliament
s
housing
communities
and
local
government
committee
if
i
m
a
retailer
i
will
make
sure
not
to
pay
the
tax
i
keep
percent
of
my
revenues
going
through
the
high
street
he
said
noting
that
sports
direct
has
a
million
pounds
internet
business
he
said
that
if
the
new
levy
came
in
it
would
make
sense
for
sports
direct
and
retailers
in
general
to
invest
in
and
keep
stores
open
with
annual
revenue
of
about
billion
pounds
sports
direct
currently
would
not
be
liable
for
the
tax
ashley
proposed
ashley
also
called
on
local
councils
to
offer
retailers
free
business
rates
property
taxes
for
five
years
if
every
pound
of
free
rates
was
matched
by
retailer
investment
in
the
site
the
parliamentary
committee
is
conducting
an
inquiry
into
the
future
of
traditional
retail
districts
after
a
torrid
year
for
the
sector
a
string
of
british
store
groups
have
gone
out
of
business
or
announced
shop
closures
this
year
as
they
battle
subdued
consumer

rising

higher

growing

spencer
debenhams
mothercare
and
house
of
fraser
are
in
the
hundreds
a
net
stores
disappeared
from
britain
s
top
high
streets
in
the
first
half
of
research
by
pwc
showed
last
month
an
estimated
people
have
been
affected
this
year
by
the
sector
s
upheaval
the
bbc
reported
on
monday
in
august
sports
direct
snapped
up
the
house
of
fraser
department
store
chain
for
million
pounds
after
it
collapsed
into
administration
so
far
ashley
has
secured
the
future
of
about
stores
he
has
blamed
the
closure
of
others
on
landlords
for
not
offering
more
favourable
terms
ashley
told
lawmakers
his
target
was
to
keep
percent
of
house
of
fraser
s
stores
open
i
m
not
father
christmas
i
m
actually
i
believe
a
very
fair
guy
he
told
lawmakers
in
october
sports
direct
purchased
specialist
bicycle
retailer
evans
cycles
for
an
undisclosed
sum
immediately
after
its
parent
went
into
administration
but
ashley
said
that
only
half
of
the
chain
s
stores
would
avoid
closure
ashley
s
parliamentary
appearance
was
not
his
first
in
he
was
summoned
to
explain
sports
direct
s
working
practices
and
conceded
it
had
effectively
paid
some
warehouse
staff
below
the
statutory
minimum
wage
