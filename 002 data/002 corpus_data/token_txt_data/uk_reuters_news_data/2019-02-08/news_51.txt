cancelling
plans
to
make
the
next
model

utility
vehicle
in
britain
less
than
two
months
before
the
country
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
broadcaster
sky
news
said
on
saturday
nissan
first
said
four
months
after
britain
voted
in
june
to
leave
the
eu
that
it
would
manufacture
a
new
model
of
the
suv
in
britain
which
was
seen
as
a
major
vote
of
confidence
in
the
country
s
manufacturing
future
the
main
production
plant
for
the
current
is
in
japan
while
nissan
s
plant
in
sunderland
northeast
england
makes
the
smaller
qashqai
suv
and
other
models
precise
details
of
nissan
s
impending
announcement
were
unclear
this
weekend
but
sources
said
it
was
likely
to
initially
involve
abandoning
the
production
plans
which
had
been
announced
in
the
autumn
of
sky
reported
a
spokesman
for
nissan
declined
to
comment
sky
said
the
announcement
due
on
monday
was
not
expected
to
lead
to
immediate
job
losses
at
the
sunderland
plant
as
the
is
not
currently
made
there
but
would
raise
doubts
about
further
nissan
investment
in
britain
as
well
as
the
nissan
said
in
it
would
build
the
next
generation
qashqai
suv
in
britain
after
receiving
government
assurances
over
brexit
in
what
was
seen
at
the
time
as
a
boost
for
prime
minister
theresa
may
however
the
failure
of
britain
s
government
so
far
to
negotiate
a
smooth
exit
plan
from
the
european
union
has
made
car
manufacturers
less
willing
to
use
britain
as
a
european
manufacturing
center
investment
in
britain
s
car
industry
halved
last
year
data

thursday
and
car
production
by
nissan
in
britain
fell
by
more
than
percent

body
the

said
leaving
the
eu
on
march
without
a
transition
deal
to
preserve
the
smooth
flow
of
parts
and
finished
vehicles
across

would
cause
