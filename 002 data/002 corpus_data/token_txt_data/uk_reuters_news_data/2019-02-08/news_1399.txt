bangkok
reuters
thailand
has
asked
britain
to
extradite
former
prime
minister
yingluck
shinawatra
overthrown
in
a
coup
in
and
sentenced
in
absentia
to
jail
for
negligence
prime
minister
prayuth
said
on
tuesday
yingluck
fled
the
country
last
august
to
avoid
being
jailed
over
a
rice
subsidy
scheme
that
ran
up
losses
in
the
billions
of
dollars
she
has
denied
wrongdoing
and
said
the
trial
was
politically
motivated
the
supreme
court
sentenced
her
in
absentia
to
five
years
jail
last
september
prayuth
said
the
request
was
a
necessary
procedure
between
the
two
countries
which
share
an
extradition
treaty
we
can
not
go
and
arrest
people
abroad
so
it
is
up
to
that
country
to
arrest
and
send
her
to
us
prayuth
said
yingluck
and
her
brother
ousted
former
prime
minister
thaksin
shinawatra
have
been
at
the
centre
of
a
power
struggle
that
has
dominated
thai
politics
for
more
than
a
decade
pitting
traditional
royalist
and
the
military
elite
against
the
shinawatra
family
and
their
supporters
in
the
rural
north
and
northeast
it
was
not
immediately
clear
why
the
government
had
waited
until
now
to
seek
yingluck
s
extradition
or
how
britain
would
respond
with
a
general
election
due
for
some
time
next
year
both
thaksin
and
yingluck
still
wield
significant
political
influence
the
junta
has
long
maintained
that
it
is
unconcerned
by
the
shinawatra
siblings
but
critics
say
the
military
is
looking
to
end
the
family
s
political
influence
by
introducing
a
new
constitution
and
restrictions
on
political
parties
