tamara
and
yuri
baikov
knew
it
was
time
to
move
away
from
their
village
when
one
of
their
ducks
wandered
into
a
neighbour
s
plot
of
land
only
to
return
with
a
wire
deliberately
threaded
through
its
beak
since
then
the
husband
and
wife
have
lived
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
a
primitive
hut
in
a
forest
in
northeastern
belarus
close
to
the
russian
border
there
are
no
people
there
is
no
conflict
said
tamara
baikov
who
says
she
loves
weeding
her
vegetable
patch
and
would
rather
plough
a
hectare
of
land
than
venture
to
a
city
life
is
simple
for
the
two
there
is
no
electricity
so
they
read
by
torchlight
they
take
the
water
they
need
from
the
river
and
cook
with
a
stove
their
chickens
and
ducks
provide
them
with
meat
and
eggs
their
goats
give
them
milk
and
cottage
cheese
manure
is
their
only
fertiliser
for
growing
potatoes
and
vegetables
daughter
veronika
is
their
main
contact
with
the
outside
world
she
brings
any
additional
supplies
they
might
need
from
a
store
and
also
sells
their
produce
to
generate
some
income
our
veronika
sells
all
this
in
neighbouring
russia
plus
a
pension
we
have
enough
to
live
on
yuri
said
we
can
not
leave
our
animals
and
birds
even
for
a
day
and
we
don
t
want
they
live
on
a
small
farm
they
built
in
the
nearest
belarussian
village
yukhovichi
is
km
miles
away
while
russia
is
a
few
hundred
metres
across
the
river
they
used
to
live
in
yukhovichi
as
farmers
keeping
cows
and
poultry
but
dwelling
near
other
people
did
not
suit
them
the
injured
duck
was
one
example
in
late
the
local
authorities
gave
them
a
piece
of
land
in
the
forest
and
one
night
in
may
they
left
together
with
veronika
five
cows
some
groceries
tools
and
nails
they
spent
the
first
few
nights
under
a
linden
tree
covering
themselves
in
plastic
sheets
for
warmth
veronika
grew
up
and
eventually
moved
beyond
the
river
to
a
village
in
russia
called
davostsy
she
now
has
a
daughter
of
her
own
called
angelina
tamara
and
yuri
stayed
in
the
cramped
hut
that
was
initially
intended
as
a
temporary
shelter
they
had
planned
to
build
a
proper
house
but
a
lack
of
money
and
bureaucratic
hassles
prevented
them
from
doing
so
they
like
to
listen
to
russian
radio
stations
to
keep
up
with
world
news
but
mostly
they
enjoy
the
solitude
silence
is
very
good
only
grandma
is
not
silent
she
talks
a
lot

joked

to
his
wife
