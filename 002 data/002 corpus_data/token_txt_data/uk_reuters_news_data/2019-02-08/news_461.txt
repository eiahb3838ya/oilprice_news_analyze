spain
s
vox
party
won
seats
in
an
election
in
andalusia
on

and
could
end
up
as
a
kingmaker
in
the
region
in
the
first
electoral
success
for
the
since
the
country
s
return
to
democracy
in
the
late
it
was
the
first
time
the
nationalist
surge
that
has
swept
much
of
europe
had
reached
spain
long
seen
as
immune
because
many
still
remember
the
military
dictatorship
of
francisco
franco
with
the
socialists
weakened
in
a
region
they
governed
since
franco
s
death
and
which
they
could
now
lose
to
a
coalition
the
andalusia
result
is
likely
to
send
shockwaves
through
the
spanish
political
landscape
a
series
of
local
municipal
and
european
elections
will
follow
at
the
end
of
may

francisco
serrano
vox
s
candidate
in
andalusia
told
a
loud
crowd
gathered
in
seville
many
of
whom
waved
spanish
flags
and
chanted
spain
spain
there
are
a
total
of
seats
in
andalusia
s
regional
assembly
and
the
vote
was
very
divided
in
a
fresh
sign
of
how
the
large
parties
are
finding
it
harder
and
harder
to
secure
majorities
in
spain
with
percent
of
ballots
counted
the
socialists
received
most
votes
but
with
only
seats
for
them
and
for
the
podemos
and
its
allies
that
is
well
down
from
previous
elections
and
they
would
struggle
to
secure
a
majority
the
conservative
people
s
party
pp
which
came
second
said
they
would
seek
leadership
of
spain
s
most
populous
region
change
has
won
in
andalusia
pp
candidate
juanma
moreno
told
a
rally
the
pp
s
national
leader
pablo
casado
said
his
party
planned
to
hold
talks
in
andalusia
with
all
the
parties
to
the
right
of
the
socialists
that
would
include
vox
and
the
ciudadanos
together
they
have
a
majority
of
seats
all
three
hailed
the
result
of
the
andalusia
election
and
said
they
wanted
to
boot
the
socialists
out
of
the
region
the
socialists
urged
mainstream
parties
to
block
the
and
said
they
saw
vox
s
seats
as
very
this
phenomenon
we
have
seen
in
the
rest
of
europe
and
the
world
has
now
reached
spain
and
is
entering
the
andalusia
parliament
susana
diaz
the
socialist
candidate
in
the
region
told
supporters
andalusia
which
has
one
of
europe
s
highest
unemployment
rates
is
the
entry
point
for
thousands
of
africans
who
have
been
reaching
spain
by
sea
in
greater
numbers
as
traffic
on
the
other
main
route
across
the
mediterranean
to
italy
has
been
curbed
french
leader
marine
le
pen
congratulated
vox
tweeting
strong
and
warm
congratulations
to
my
friends
from
vox
who
tonight
in
spain
scored
a
very
meaningful
result
for
such
a
young
and
dynamic
the
vote
was
the
first
electoral
test
for
socialist
prime
minister
pedro
sanchez
who
came
to
power
without
an
election
in
june
after
parliament
ousted
the
conservatives
over
a
corruption
scandal
the
next
national
election
is
due
in
but
speculation
has
been
rife
for
months
that
sanchez
who
controls
fewer
than
a
quarter
of
seats
in
the
madrid
parliament
could
call
a
snap
vote
however
senior
socialists
said
before
the
andalusia
election
that
they
did
not
expect
it
to
trigger
a
general
election
and
there
would
seem
to
be
little
incentive
for
sanchez
to
do
so
now
after
the
disappointing
results
for
his
party
in
andalusia
much
will
depend
now
on
whether
the
socialists
who
have
not
yet
managed
to
get
the
country
s
budget
approved
in
parliament
gather
enough
support
from
smaller
parties
including
catalan
nationalists
