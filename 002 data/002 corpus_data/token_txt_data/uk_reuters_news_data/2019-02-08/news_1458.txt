quitting
the
eu
could
leave
british
households
up
to
pounds
worse
off
each
year
according
to
a
report
households
will
face
higher
prices
as
they
absorb
costs
from
labour
changes
tariffs
and
red
tape
it
said
whilst
consumer
businesses
could
see
profits
slump
by
percent
the
report
by
consulting
firm
oliver
wyman
focused
on
five
different
brexit
scenarios
where
the
size
of
the
annual
economic
impact
would
vary
between
and
pounds
depending
on
whether
the
uk
avoids
eu
tariffs
the
most
costly
scenario
was
predicted
to
be
a
deal
where
the
uk
reverted
to
world
trade
organisation
wto
nation
mfn
import
tariffs
leaving
the
eu
customs
union
and
its
single
market
consumer
prices
could
be
affected
further
by
a
devaluation
of
the
pound
and
the
likelihood
that
free
trade
deals
with
countries
would
fail
adequately
to
mitigate
the
impact
on
households
the
report
said
two
months
ago
a
report
by
the
house
of
lords
european
union
committee
said
food
prices
are
likely
to
rise
after
brexit
if
no
trade
agreement
with
the
eu
is
reached
and
that
there
could
be
shortages
of
some
products
