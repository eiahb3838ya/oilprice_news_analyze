reuters
the
united
states
said
it
was
ready
to
resume
talks
with
north
korea
after
pyongyang
pledged
on
wednesday
to
dismantle
its
key
missile
facilities
and
suggested
it
would
close
its
main
yongbyon
nuclear
complex
if
washington
took
unspecified
actions
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
he
had
invited
north
korea
s
foreign
minister
to
meet
in
new
york
next
week
with
the
aim
of
completing
its
denuclearisation
by
january
after
a
pyongyang
summit
between
the
leaders
of
the
two
koreas
the
united
states
appeared
eager
to
seize
on
commitments
by
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
at
his
talks
with
south
korean
president
moon
even
as
critics
said
the
steps
did
little
to
put
pyongyang
on
a
course
for
irreversible
denuclearisation
north
korea
will
allow
experts
from
concerned
countries
to
watch
the
closure
of
its
missile
engine
testing
site
and
launch
pad
at
moon
said
at
a
joint
news
conference
with
kim
after
their
meeting
in
the
north
korean
capital
north
korea
will
also
take
additional
steps
such
as
closing
its
main
yongbyon
nuclear
complex
if
the
united
states
undertook
unspecified
reciprocal
measures
moon
added
the
sudden
revival
of
diplomacy
followed
weeks
of
doubts
in
president
donald
trump
s
administration
s
about
whether
north
korea
was
willing
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
after
a
june
summit
between
trump
and
kim
yielded
few
tangible
results
the
january
completion
date
was
the
most
specific
deadline
set
in
what
is
expected
to
be
a
long
process
of
trying
to
get
the
north
to
end
its
nuclear
programme
which
may
threaten
allies
south
korea
and
japan
as
well
as
the
homeland
in
addition
to
inviting
north
korean
foreign
minister
ri
yong
ho
to
meet
when
both
are
in
new
york
next
week
for
the
annual
general
assembly
gathering
of
world
leaders
pompeo
said
washington
invited
pyongyang
s
representatives
to
meet
the
special
representative
for
north
korea
stephen
biegun
in
vienna
at
the
earliest
china
north
korea
s
most
important
economic
backer
and
diplomatic
ally
said
it
warmly
welcomed
the
agreement
reached
in
pyongyang
and
strongly
supported
it
we
absolutely
can
not
let
this
hard
to
come
by
opportunity
for
peace
slip
away
once
again
the
chinese
government
s
top
diplomat
state
councillor
wang
yi
said
in
a
statement
some
officials
were
deeply
sceptical
speaking
before
pompeo
s
announcement
two
senior
officials
involved
in
korea
policy
voiced
fears
kim
was
trying
to
drive
a
wedge
between
washington
and
seoul
at
the
summit
the
two
koreas
agreed
on
plans
to
resume
economic
cooperation
including
working
to
reconnect
rail
and
road
links
they
agreed
as
well
to
restart
a
joint
factory
park
in
a
border
city
of
kaesong
and
tours
to
the
north
s
mount
kumgang
resort
when
conditions
are
met
officials
suggested
kim
was
trying
to
ease
the
economic
pressure
on
him
to
curb
his
nuclear
programs
and
to
undercut
the
rationale
for
troops
being
based
in
south
korea
by
improving
relations
with
seoul
the
united
states
has
some
troops
in
south
korea
to
deter
north
korean
attack
pyongyang
has
long
sought
their
withdrawal
and
trump
has
questioned
their
rationale
and
cost
there
is
nothing
the
north
has
offered
so
far
that
would
constitute
irreversible
movement
toward
denuclearisation
however
you
define
that
by
january
or
any
other
time
or
even
a
reduction
of
the
military
threat
it
poses
to
the
south
and
the
region
said
a
intelligence
official
everything
that
s
out
there
now
is
conditional
on
actions
that
would
reduce
the
pressure
on
the
north
to
cooperate
or
is
filled
with
loopholes
and
exit
ramps
added
the
official
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
officials
said
the
ambiguity
about
what
washington
was
supposed
to
do
for
the
north
to
close
its
nuclear
complex
at
yongbyon
gave
kim
room
to
argue
that
washington
had
not
done
enough
for
north
korea
to
follow
through
on
its
pledges
even
if
north
korea
were
to
shut
down
yongbyon
officials
and
experts
believe
it
has
other
secret
nuclear
facilities
south
korea
s
national
security
adviser
chung
said
the
reciprocal
steps
could
include
an
declaration
south
korea
and
the
united
states
remain
technically
at
war
with
north
korea
because
the
korean
war
ended
in
an
armistice
and
not
a
peace
treaty
though
wednesday
s
agreement
failed
to
stipulate
the
north
s
commitment
to
declare
nuclear
and
missile
facilities
for
inspection
and
eventual
decommissioning
seoul
has
been
in
talks
with
both
pyongyang
and
washington
over
the
issue
a
senior
south
korean
official
said
what
north
korea
really
wants
and
their
priorities
may
be
different
from
ours
the
official
told
reporters
on
thursday
on
condition
of
anonymity
we
re
talking
about
a
package
that
would
carry
many
elements
including
the
declaration
of
the
facilities
yongbyon
and
which
are
of
interest
and
from
the
north
side
the
issues
of
normalizing
relations
ending
the
war
and
easing
despite
the
doubts
of
officials
and
outside
analysts
north
korea
s
pledge
at
the
summit
with
the
south
korean
president
drew
an
enthusiastic
response
from
trump
speaking
before
pompeo
s
comments
welcomed
kim
s
pledges
calling
them
part
of
tremendous
progress
with
pyongyang
on
a
number
of
fronts
and
hailing
very
good
news
from
the
summit
between
the
koreas
he
s
calm
i
m
calm
so
we
ll
see
what
happens
trump
who
last
year
threatened
to
destroy
north
korea
told
reporters
kim
pledged
to
work
toward
the
complete
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
during
two
meetings
with
moon
earlier
this
year
and
at
his
summit
with
trump
but
discussions
over
how
to
implement
the
vague
commitments
have
since
faltered
and
north
korea
has
consistently
refused
to
give
up
its
nuclear
arsenal
unilaterally
washington
has
demanded
concrete
action
such
as
a
full
disclosure
of
north
korea
s
nuclear
and
missile
facilities
before
agreeing
to
pyongyang
s
key
goals
including
an
easing
of
international
sanctions
and
an
official
end
to
the
korean
war
while
north
korea
has
stopped
nuclear
and
missile
tests
in
the
past
year
it
did
not
allow
international
inspections
of
its
dismantling
of
its
nuclear
test
site
in
may
drawing
criticism
that
its
action
was
for
show
and
could
be
reversed
the
day
after
the
june
summit
pompeo
said
he
hoped
to
achieve
major
disarmament
by
north
korea
by
the
end
of
trump
s
first
term
in
january
his
latest
statement
that
the
process
should
be
completed
by
january
may
be
a
signal
washington
will
not
wait
forever
the
statement
clearly
implies
that
summits
and
theatrical
promises
to
dismantle
the
odd
facility
simply
can
t
substitute
for
a
negotiating
process
on
the
nuclear
issue
said
the
asia
society
policy
institute
s
daniel
russel
invoking
the
end
of
trump
s
term
in
january
is
another
way
of
saying
to
the
north
that
american
patience
is
not
unlimited
and
that
kim
jong
un
won
t
be
able
to
sidestep
denuclearisation
indefinitely
