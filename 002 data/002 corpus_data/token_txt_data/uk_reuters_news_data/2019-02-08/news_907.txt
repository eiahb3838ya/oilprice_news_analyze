edinburgh
reuters
the
european
court
of
justice
has
set
a
date
for
a
hearing
to
decide
whether
britain
s
parliament
can
unilaterally
change
its
mind
on
brexit
a
legal
source
told
reuters
adding
that
the
case
is
moving
fast
scottish
lawmakers
opposed
to
brexit
filed
a
petition
with
scotland
s
court
of
session
last
year
to
show
that
britain
has
a
unilateral
option
of
staying
in
the
world
s
biggest
trading
bloc
once
the
outcome
of
brexit
is
known
they
argue
that
while
there
is
no
legal
doubt
that
britain
could
stop
brexit
with
the
permission
of
the
other
eu
member
states
it
should
seek
to
establish
a
legal
right
to
do
so
unilaterally
whether
the
rest
of
the
bloc
likes
it
or
not
the
news
comes
as
britain
appears
to
be
on
the
brink
of
an
agreement
with
brussels
over
its
decision
to
leave
the
european
union
diplomatic
sources
said
on
friday
because
no
country
has
ever
left
the
eu
before
the
exact
meaning
of
article
of
the
lisbon
treaty
which
regulates
withdrawal
from
the
eu
is
untested
we
have
our
hearing
on
november
at
the
source
said
speaking
on
condition
of

this
shows
the
ecj
is
moving
at
breakneck
speed
on
this
the

which
rules
on

make
a
decision
