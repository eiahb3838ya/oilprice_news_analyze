linde-praxair merger hits antitrust hurdle; talks continue
munich
reuters
industrial
gases
giants
linde
and
praxair
are
in
talks
to
try
to
salvage
their
billion
merger
after
competition
regulators
demanded
they
sell
assets
that
generate
more
than
billion
in
sales
linde
said
on
wednesday
the
divestments
were
expected
to
reach
a
level
that
would
allow
either
party
to
abandon
the
deal
although
the
german
company
added
that
talks
continued
with
both
praxair
and
regulators
analysts
said
they
still
expected
the
deal
to
go
ahead
though
they
cautioned
the
asset
sales
could
make
the
deal
less
attractive
make
synergy
targets
harder
to
achieve
linde
and
praxair
agreed
an
merger
in
principle
in
december
aiming
to
create
a
global
leader
in
gas
distribution
ahead
of
france
s
air
liquide
which
had
also
bulked
up
with
the
takeover
of
rival
airgas
the
companies
agreed
that
if
antitrust
regulators
demanded
the
disposal
of
businesses
with
more
than
billion
euros
billion
in
sales
or
billion
euros
in
earnings
before
interest
taxes
depreciation
and
amortization
ebitda
either
party
could
withdraw
without
penalty
linde
said
on
wednesday
it
expected
the
revenue
threshold
for
divestment
commitments
to
be
exceeded
but
didn
t
say
by
how
much
and
did
not
mention
the
ebitda
hurdle
it
had
previously
warned
this
was
very
likely
to
happen
linde
and
praxair
remain
in
constructive
dialogue
with
each
other
and
the
regulators
on
how
to
satisfy
their
requirements
linde
said
earlier
this
month
the
federal
trade
commission
ftc
asked
for
more
assets
to
be
sold
than
previously
anticipated
and
also
said
it
wanted
prospective
buyers
of
these
assets
to
meet
certain
other
requirements
bids
for
major
firms
have
had
mixed
fortunes

meanwhile
went
through
after
billion
euros
worth
of
disposals
a
source
familiar
with
linde
s
thinking
said
both
companies
were
doing
everything
they
could
to
see
the
deal
through
but
they
could
not
lose
track
of
the
targeted
billion
in
annual
synergies
without
perhaps
putting
shareholders
support
at
risk
commerzbank
analyst
michael
schaefer
said
he
expected
linde
and
praxair
to
seek
to
address
the
ftc
s
demands
the
fact
that
they
remain
in
constructive
talks
signals
to
us
that
there
is
still
readiness
on
both
sides
to
stay
the
course
he
said
linde
shares
were
down
percent
at
gmt
paring
initial
losses
of
percent
the
german
group
last
month
lined
up
a
consortium
of
gases
firm
messer
and
investor
cvc
as
a
buyer
of
north
and
south
american
assets
to
allay
antitrust
concerns
while
praxair
s
european
gases
business
will
be
sold
to
japanese
rival
taiyo
nippon
sanso
corp
the
source
said
regulators
had
some
qualms
about
the
proposed
buyer
of
the
former
block
of
assets
which
linde
has
been
trying
to
address
while
the
european
commission
gave
its
this
week
regulators
in
the
united
states
china
india
brazil
south
korea
argentina
and
chile
have
yet
to
decide
arne
rautenberg
a
fund
manager
at
union
investment
this
week
said
he
expected
the
deal
to
be
salvaged
but
added
linde
might
have
to
shed
its
business
in
the
united
states
an
operator
of
gas
production
facilities
near
petrochemical
and
steel
plants
which
would
be
a
huge
blow
the
regulatory
challenge
is
a
setback
for
linde
chairman
wolfgang
reitzle
who
has
been
a
driving
force
for
the
deal
and
had
to
reshuffle
management
following
the
departure
of
the
company
s
chief
executive
and
finance
chief
the
companies
face
an
deadline
to
complete
the
deal
under
german
financial
market
rules
the
time
pressure
would
put
linde
and
praxair
in
a
weak
position
when
negotiating
a
price
with
prospective
buyers
of
the
assets
