milan
reuters
easyjet
and
lufthansa
are
still
interested
in
alitalia
after
an
italian
minister
said
this
week
the
government
wants
the
majority
of
the
carrier
under
state
control
the
british
and
german
carriers
said
easyjet
lufthansa
and
budget
carrier
wizz
air
submitted
expressions
of
interest
earlier
this
year
in
at
least
parts
of
alitalia
but
the
lengthy
formation
of
a
new
government
in
italy
which
finally
came
to
power
in
june
delayed
the
process
new
transport
minister
danilo
toninelli
said
this
week
there
was
a
need
for
percent
of
alitalia
to
be
kept
in
italian
hands
but
with
a
strong
investor
next
to
it
alitalia
needs
to
return
to
being
a
true
flag
carrier
lufthansa
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
italian
market
is
important
for
it
but
that
alitalia
must
be
restructured
before
it
would
invest
a
spokesman
said
the
german
company
had
already
submitted
a
document
to
this
effect
to
the
new
government
we
can
imagine
further
talks
on
this
basis
he
said
on
friday
easyjet
ceo
johan
lundgren
said
at
the
farnborough
airshow
this
week
that
the
company
remained
interested
in
parts
of
alitalia
but
needed
to
study
the
details
of
what
the
new
government
is
proposing
alitalia
once
a
symbol
of
italy
s
economic
boom
but
struggling
to
compete
against
carriers
and
high
speed
trains
in
recent
years
was
put
under
special
administration
last
year
after
workers
rejected
its
latest
rescue
plan
full
story
italy
s
deputy
prime
minister
and
minister
of
internal
affairs
matteo
salvini
has
said
alitalia
was
to
return
to
profitability
and
if
there
are
serious
private
partners
so
much
the
better
the
only
think
we
won
t
allow
is
a
of
the
company
he
said
however
sector
analysts
remain
dubious
that
the
government
will
find
an
investor
willing
to
put
money
into
an
alitalia
in
which
the
state
has
a
say
especially
given
past
political
meddling
that
has
failed
to
return
the
company
to
profitability
even
if
the
state
takes
only
a
minority
stake
in
alitalia
no
investor
will
dare
getting
close
given
what
happened
in
the
past
said
andrea
giuricin
ceo
of
tra
consulting
and
author
of
the
endless
privatisation
of
alitalia
repeated
state
bailouts
have
cost
italian
taxpayers
around
billion
euros
over
a
decade
giuricin
estimates
yet
the
airline
s
situation
remains
precarious
the
carrier
is
losing
at
least
one
million
euros
per
day
he
added
in
the
first
quarter
alitalia
posted
an
ebitda
loss
of
million
euros
million
compared
with
a
loss
of
million
a
year
earlier
alitalia
s
commissioners
are
due
to
meet
government
officials
on
july
the
government
appointed
three
commissioners
last
year
to
assess
whether
alitalia
can
be
restructured
either
as
a
standalone
company
or
through
a
partial
or
total
sale
or
else
liquidated
