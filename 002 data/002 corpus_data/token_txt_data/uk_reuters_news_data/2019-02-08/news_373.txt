london
reuters
prime
minister
theresa
may
survived
a
confidence
vote
by
the
conservative
party
on
wednesday
but
a
mutiny
by
more
than
a
third
of
her
lawmakers
indicated
parliament
was
heading
towards
deadlock
over
brexit
while
conservative
lawmakers
voted
in
support
of
may
as
leader
dissented
indicating
opposition
not
only
from
several
dozen
supporters
of
a
hard
brexit
but
also
from
many
more
pragmatic
lawmakers
and
signalling
that
she
was
no
nearer
to
passing
her
eu
divorce
agreement
it
was
not
the
robust
affirmation
she
needed
as
she
heads
to
brussels
on
thursday
to
ask
the
other
eu
leaders
who
have
made
room
for
her
at
a
summit
for
clarification
of
the
deal
to
reassure
the
doubters
on
monday
may
had
cancelled
a
parliamentary
vote
on
her
deal
struck
after
two
years
of
negotiations
and
designed
to
maintain
close
future
ties
with
the
bloc
after
admitting
it
would
be
heavily
defeated
with
britain
due
to
leave
the
eu
on
march
parliament
s
opposition
has
suddenly
opened
up
possibilities
including
a
potentially
disorderly
exit
with
no
deal
or
even
another
referendum
on
membership
speaking
in
downing
street
after
the
vote
may
said
she
would
listen
to
those
who
had
voted
against
her
and
seek
legal
assurances
on
the
most
controversial
part
of
her
deal
an
insurance
policy
to
prevent
a
hard
border
between
eu
member
ireland
and
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
many
in
her
party
fear
that
these
backstop
measures
could
last
indefinitely
a
significant
number
of
colleagues
did
cast
a
vote
against
me
and
i
ve
listened
to
what
they
said
may
said
we
now
have
to
get
on
with
the
job
of
delivering
brexit
for
the
british
however
eu
leaders
have
lined
up
to
say
they
have
no
intention
of
changing
the
agreement
and
diplomatic
sources
in
brussels
told
reuters
the
draft
of
a
document
being
prepared
for
may
included
only
the
possibility
that
the
bloc
would
look
into
giving
britain
more
assurances
over
the
irish
backstop
without
offering
any
immediately
eurosceptic
critics
of
the
deal
within
may
s
party
triggered
the
vote
hours
after
she
returned
from
a
tour
to
meet
european
leaders
at
the
start
of
the
week
supporters
said
the
result
showed
the
party
should
now
get
behind
her
but
the
eurosceptics
who
see
her
deal
as
a
betrayal
of
the
referendum
said
she
should
now
quit
it
is
a
terrible
result
for
the
prime
minister
jacob
leader
of
a
hard
brexit
faction
told
bbc
television
the
prime
minister
must
realise
that
under
all
constitutional
norms
she
ought
to
go
and
see
the
queen
urgently
and
may
who
voted
to
remain
in
the
eu
in
the
referendum
had
warned
opponents
of
her
withdrawal
deal
that
if
they
toppled
her
brexit
would
be
delayed
or
stopped
shortly
before
the
vote
may
sought
to
win
over
wavering
lawmakers
by
promising
to
step
down
before
the
election
but
the
confidence
vote
was
also
a
proxy
for
the
party
s
divisions
over
europe
if
you
re
a
pm
and
a
third
of
your
mps
vote
against
you
that
is
very
bad
news
eurosceptic
lawmaker
mark
francois
told
reuters
the
northern
irish
party
that
props
up
her
government
and
strongly
opposes
her
withdrawal
deal
said
the
fundamental
arithmetic
in
parliament
was
unchanged
the
opposition
labour
party
said
she
must
now
bring
the
agreement
back
to
parliament
brexit
is
britain
s
most
significant
political
and
economic
decision
since
world
war
two
fear
the
departure
will
weaken
the
west
as
it
grapples
with
the
presidency
of
donald
trump
and
growing
assertiveness
from
russia
and
china
the
outcome
will
shape
britain
s
trillion
economy
have
consequences
for
the
unity
of
the
kingdom
and
determine
whether
london
keeps
its
place
as
one
of
the
top
two
global
financial
centres
supporters
of
brexit
admit
there
may
be
some
pain
for
the
economy
but
say
it
will
prosper
in
the
long
term
when
cut
free
from
the
eu
which
they
cast
as
a
failing
experiment
in
european
integration
may
won
the
top
job
in
the
turmoil
that
followed
the
eu
referendum
where
britons
decided
by
percent
to
to
leave
the
eu
she
promised
to
implement
brexit
while
keeping
close
ties
to
the
bloc
to
heal
a
divided
nation
sterling
jumped
as
high
as
as
the
result
came
in
but
then
fell
to
still
up
percent
on
the
day
after
it
emerged
that
the
number
of
lawmakers
who
had
voted
against
may
was
higher
than
many
in
the
markets
had
expected
it
is
right
at
the
top
end
of
the
number
of
people
who
were
expected
to
be
against
her
said
john
curtice
one
of
britain
s
leading
polling
experts
it
is
not
unlikely
that
she
will
go
by
some
point
