london
reuters
the
labour
party
said
on
monday
prime
minister
theresa
may
had
only
offered
a
date
for
a
new
vote
on
her
brexit
deal
because
it
had
threatened
to
call
for
a
motion
of
no
confidence
in
her
the
prime
minister
has
been
forced
to
bring
her
botched
deal
back
to
parliament
under
threat
of
a
motion
of
no
confidence
in
her
a
spokesman
said
we
will
not
let
her
cynically
run
down
the
clock
to
create
the
false
choice
between
her
botched
deal
and
no
deal
it
is
disgraceful
that
a
month
has
been
wasted
we
were
due
to
vote
on
december
and
there
can
be
no
further
attempts
to
dodge
accountability
