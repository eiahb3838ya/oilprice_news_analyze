had
postponed

due
to
the
partial
shutdown
of
the
government
the
nationally
televised
address
from
the
chamber
of
the
house
of
representatives
now
set
for
presents
trump
with
a
powerful
opportunity
to
appeal
directly
to
the
american
public
to
support
his
policies
including
his
demand
that
congress
fund
a
wall
along
the
border
with
mexico
the
speech
had
originally
been
scheduled
for
but
pelosi
cancelled
it
last

saying
it
should
not
be
delivered
until
a
partial
government
shutdown
was
over
the
shutdown
brought
about
by
a
fight
between
the
white
house
and
democrats
in
congress
over
his
wall
funding
demands
ended
on
friday
after
days
paving
the
way
for
the
speech
to
go
ahead
in
a
letter
to
trump
on
monday
that
she
posted
to
twitter
pelosi
said
the
two
had
spoken
and
agreed
on
the
new
date
it
is
my
great
honour
to
accept
trump
wrote
in
reply
in
pelosi
had
suggested
to
trump
that
he
reschedule
the
speech
citing
security
concerns
related
to
the
shutdown
and
the
next
day
trump
blocked
an
overseas
trip
pelosi
had
planned
in
a
move
many
saw
as
retribution
last
wednesday
trump
told
pelosi
he
was
looking
forward
to
delivering
the
speech
as
scheduled
but
pelosi
the
top
ranking
democrat
in
congress
quickly
yanked
her
invitation
in
what
was
widely
seen
as
an
effort
to
deprive
trump
of
the
national
spotlight
in
the
middle
of
the
border
