british lawmakers instruct may to change brexit deal; eu says 'no'
london
reuters
british
lawmakers
on
tuesday
instructed
prime
minister
theresa
may
to
reopen
a
brexit
treaty
with
the
european
union
to
replace
a
controversial
irish
border
arrangement
and
promptly
received
a
flat
rejection
from
brussels
two
weeks
after
overwhelmingly
rejecting
may
s
brexit
deal
parliament
backed
a
proposal
intended
to
send
her
back
to
brussels
with
a
stronger
mandate
to
seek
changes
that
were
more
likely
to
win
their
support
at
the
same
time
they
rejected
a
proposal
to
give
parliament
a
path
to
prevent
a
potentially
chaotic
exit
by
making
may
ask
brussels
for
a
delay
if
she
can
not
get
a
deal
through
parliament
with
two
months
left
until
britain
is
due
by
law
to
leave
the
eu
investors
and
allies
have
urged
the
government
to
clinch
a
deal
to
allow
an
orderly
exit
from
the
club
it
joined
in
tonight
a
majority
of
honourable
members
have
said
they
would
support
a
deal
with
changes
to
the
backstop
may
said
only
two
weeks
after
her
divorce
deal
was
crushed
in
the
biggest
parliamentary
defeat
in
modern
british
history
it
is
now
clear
that
there
is
a
route
that
can
secure
a
substantial
and
sustainable
majority
in
the
house
for
leaving
the
eu
with
a
deal
may
said
adding
she
would
seek
legally
binding
changes
the
irish
backstop
is
an
insurance
policy
that
aims
to
prevent
the
reintroduction
of
a
hard
border
between
ireland
and
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
a
crucial
part
of
a
peace
deal
that
ended
decades
of
sectarian
violence
and
preserve
frictionless
trade
however
critics
said
it
could
bind
the
united
kingdom
to
the
eu
s
rules
indefinitely
the
proposal
put
forward
by
influential
conservative
lawmaker
graham
brady
and
passed
by
votes
to
called
for
the
backstop
to
be
replaced
with
unspecified
alternative
arrangements
and
said
parliament
would
support
may
s
brexit
deal
if
such
a
change
was
made
however
brussels
has
repeatedly
said
it
does
not
want
to
reopen
a
treaty
signed
off
by
the
other
eu
leaders
speaking
immediately
after
the
vote
in
parliament
a
spokesman
for
european
council
president
donald
tusk
said
the
backstop
was
part
of
the
withdrawal
deal
and
not
up
for
negotiation
a
stance
echoed
by
the
irish
government
this
is
a
deal
which
was
negotiated
with
the
uk
by
the
uk
signed
off
by
the
uk
and
the
prime
minister
and
now
it
looks
as
though
this
evening
essentially
there
is
a
and
a
reneging
on
the
commitments
that
were
made
said
irish
european
affairs
minister
helen
mcentee
french
president
emmanuel
macron
s
office
said
there
could
be
no
renegotiation
and
demanded
a
credible
british
proposal
if
the
british
parliament
can
not
find
a
majority
for
a
way
forward
the
united
kingdom
will
leave
the
largest
global
trading
bloc
without
any
deal
a
scenario
that
businesses
fear
will
bring
chaos
to
the
world
s
fifth
biggest
economy
neither
may
nor
her
ministers
spelled
out
what
compromises
she
would
seek
from
the
eu
but
suggestions
include
securing
a
time
limit
to
the
backstop
or
allowing
a
unilateral
exit
clause
elements
that
defeat
its
purpose
according
to
the
eu
hardline
conservative
lawmakers
made
clear
that
their
support
for
may
on
tuesday
was
conditional
on
her
securing
a
deal
they
approved
of
the
backstop
is
not
going
to
get
through
this
parliament
steve
baker
a
leading
member
of
the
group
told
reuters
change
the
backstop
fix
the
date
of
the
end
of
the
implementation
period
and
agree
a
plan
however
eu
diplomats
played
down
may
s
chances
of
being
able
to
present
a
substantially
different
deal
to
the
british
parliament
in
a
decisive
vote
expected
to
take
place
on
may
will
now
come
back
to
brussels
and
be
rebuffed
one
diplomat
said
the
house
of
commons
will
have
to
vote
again
on
plan
and
it
will
have
to
be
plan
a
all
over
again
but
with
even
more
pressure
of
brexit
members
of
parliament
mps
on
tuesday
rejected
two
amendments
that
set
out
a
clear
path
for
parliament
to
prevent
a
exit
if
may
can
not
get
a
deal
passed
next
month
however
they
did
later
approve
a
symbolic
proposal
calling
on
the
government
to
stop
a
potentially
disorderly
exit
sending
a
signal
that
a
majority
oppose
such
a
departure
it
provided
no
mechanism
for
preventing
a
brexit
but
kept
open
the
option
that
members
of
parliament
could
try
to
take
the
initiative
in
the
amendable
vote
that
may
has
promised
for
if
she
can
not
get
a
deal
approved
opposition
labour
party
leader
jeremy
corbyn
said
he
would
meet
may
to
find
a
sensible
brexit
solution
that
works
for
the
whole
country
listing
changes
that
labour
wanted
to
see
but
that
may
has
shown
no
sign
of
supporting
sterling
which
recently
hit
a
high
of
on
hopes
that
a
brexit
would
be
avoided
fell
about
percent
this
isn
t
a
good
night
for
the
country
labour
lawmaker
wes
streeting
tweeted
the
prime
minister
voted
against
her
own
deal
to
go
back
to
brussels
for
something
she
s
said
is
impossible
mps
voted
against
no
deal
but
also
voted
to
make
no
deal
more
likely
we
ll
be
back
for
another
round
of
groundhog
day
