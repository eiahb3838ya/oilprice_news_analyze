reuters
germany
s
antitrust
watchdog
expects
to
take
first
steps
this
year
in
its
probe
against
facebook
after
finding
that
the
social
media
giant
abused
its
market
dominance
to
gather
data
on
people
without
their
knowledge
or
consent
the
probe
is
being
closely
watched
in
europe
amid
mounting
concerns
over
leaks
of
data
on
tens
of
millions
of
facebook
users
as
well
as
the
extensive
use
of
targeted
ads
by
foreign
powers
seeking
to
influence
elections
in
the
united
states
the
federal
cartel
office
objects
in
particular
to
how
facebook
acquires
data
on
people
from
apps
including
its
own
whatsapp
and
instagram
services
and
its
online
tracking
of
people
who
aren
t
even
members
we
are
conscious
that
this
should
and
must
go
quickly
cartel
office
president
andreas
mundt
told
a
news
conference
on
monday
adding
that
he
hoped
to
take
first
steps
this
year
he
declined
to
elaborate
the
german
probe
is
not
expected
to
end
in
fines
for
facebook
in
contrast
to
european
union
probes
into
google
that
have
ended
in
penalties
most
recently
over
the
preinstallation
of
its
apps
on
android
smartphones
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
say
however
that
the
cartel
office
could
require
facebook
to
take
action
to
address
its
concerns
if
the
company
fails
to
do
so
voluntarily
facebook
responded
earlier
this
year
to
the
cartel
office
s
request
for
information
and
the
authority
was
reviewing
whether
new
features
such
as
a
clear
history
option
announced
by
ceo
mark
zuckerberg
in
may
would
address
its
concerns
we
need
to
establish
whether
this
affects
our
investigation
and
addresses
our
concerns
mundt
said
separately
mundt
confirmed
comments
he
made
in
a
newspaper
interview
earlier
this
month
that
he
may
launch
an
investigation
into
the
industry
under
new
powers
that
enable
the
cartel
office
to
launch
probes
the
focus
would
be
on
hybrid
platforms
such
as
giant
amazon
that
sell
their
own
products
and
services
but
that
also
host
traders
our
question
is
what
is
the
relationship
between
the
platform
which
itself
is
a
very
powerful
trader
and
the
traders
who
use
the
platform
said
mundt
he
added
that
amazon
was
the
of
the
platforms
but
his
interest
in
the
matter
extended
to
other
players
the
cartel
office
would
not
be
looking
at
suspected
tax
evasion
by
traders
on
platforms
an
issue
that
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
government
has
vowed
to
tackle
saying
this
was
a
matter
for
economic
policy
makers
