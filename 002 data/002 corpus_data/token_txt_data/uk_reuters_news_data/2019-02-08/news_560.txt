cairo
reuters
saudi
arabia
s
foreign
minister
said
on
tuesday
that
claims
including
by
the
cia
that
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
gave
the
order
to
kill
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
were
false
according
to
an
newspaper
interview
news
outlets
including
reuters
reported
the
cia
s
finding
over
the
weekend
in
a
case
that
has
sparked
an
international
outcry
against
the
world
s
top
oil
exporter
this
was
the
most
definitive
assessment
to
date
tying
saudi
arabia
s
de
facto
ruler
directly
to
the
killing
and
contradicted
saudi
government
assertions
that
he
was
not
involved
we
in
the
kingdom
know
that
such
allegations
about
the
crown
prince
have
no
basis
in
truth
and
we
categorically
reject
them
whether
through
leaks
or
not
foreign
minister
adel
was
quoted
as
saying
in
al
sharq
al
awsat
newspaper
in
the
first
saudi
official
comment
on
the
cia
report
they
are
leaks
that
have
not
been
officially
announced
and
i
have
noticed
that
they
are
based
on
an
assessment
not
conclusive
evidence
he
added
a
source
familiar
with
the
cia
s
assessment
said
it
was
based
largely
on
circumstantial
evidence
relating
to
the
prince
s
central
role
in
running
the
saudi
government
jubeir
was
also
asked
about
comments
by
turkish
president
tayyip
erdogan
that
the
kill
order
came
from
the
highest
level
of
the
saudi
leadership
but
probably
not
king
salman
which
has
put
the
spotlight
instead
on
the
crown
prince
we
have
already
asked
the
turkish
authorities
at
the
highest
level
about
the
meaning
of
these
comments
and
they
confirmed
to
us
categorically
that
the
crown
prince
is
not
meant
by
these
comments
he
said
the
leadership
of
the
kingdom
of
saudi
arabia
represented
by
the
custodian
of
the
two
holy
mosques
the
king
and
the
crown
prince
is
a
red
line
and
we
will
not
permit
attempts
to
harm
or
undermine
them
he
added
khashoggi
a
washington
post
contributor
and
royal
insider
who
had
been
critical
of
the
crown
prince
recently
was
killed
inside
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
on
last
week
after
offering
numerous
contradictory
explanations
for
khashoggi
s
disappearance
riyadh
said
he
had
been
killed
and
his
body
dismembered
when
negotiations
to
convince
him
to
return
to
saudi
arabia
failed
