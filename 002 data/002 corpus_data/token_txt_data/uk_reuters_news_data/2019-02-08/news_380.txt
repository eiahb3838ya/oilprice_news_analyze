sainsbury

the
british
supermarket
groups
that
want
to
combine
their
businesses
will
challenge
a
refusal
by
the
regulator
probing
their
billion
pound
billion
deal
to
give
them
longer
to
respond
to
the
latest
evidence
the
move
sent
shares
in
sainsbury
s
down
as
much
as
percent
as
it
pointed
to
growing
tension
between
the
two
companies
and
the
competition

authority
cma
regulator
sainsbury
s
chief
executive
mike
coupe
had
already
said
last
month
that
the
firm
would
challenge
in
the
courts
any
unfavourable
final
ruling
by
the
cma
on
the
deal
if
it
believed
it
was
not
backed
up
by
published
evidence
the
deal
agreed
in
april
between
sainsbury
s
and
the
british
arm
of
walmart
the
number
three
player
could
see
the
combined
group
vault
tesco
as
market
leader
it
is
being
assessed
by
the
cma
which
has
said
it
will
publish
preliminary
findings
in
early
january
ahead
of
a
final
report
in
march
both
companies
said
on
wednesday
they
will
lodge
an
application
with
the
competition
appeal
tribunal
cat
for
a
judicial
review
of
the
cma
s
phase
two
investigation
of
the
deal
which
started
in
september
their
application
requests
a
review
of
the
cma
probe
s
timetable
and
process
the
current
timetable
does
not
give
the
parties
or
the
cma
sufficient
time
to
provide
and
consider
all
the
evidence
given
the
unprecedented
scale
and
complexity
of
the
case
sainsbury
s
and
asda
said
sainsbury
s
and
asda
have
said
they
do
not
believe
the
cma
will
insist
on
a
level
of
store
disposals
in
locations
where
they
both
have
shops
that
would
make
the
deal
unpalatable
the
companies
asked
the
cma
for
an
extra
working
days
over
the
christmas
period
to
respond
to
a
large
amount
of
material
recently
provided
to
them
the
cma
declined
the
request
sainsbury
s
and
asda
feared
that
without
the
extension
they
would
not
be
able
to
meaningfully
respond
to
some
core
issues
before
the
cma
s
provisional
findings
are
published
but
the
cma
said
granting
an
extension
would
put
its
ability
to
complete
the
investigation
by
the
required
deadline
at
very
serious
risk
as
with
all
of
our
merger
reviews
we
construct
our
timetable
to
ensure
that
everyone
has
the
chance
to
have
their
say
including
customers
the
companies
involved
and
suppliers
it
said
the
cma
said
its
first
priority
was
assessing
if
customers
would
face
higher
prices
or
a
lower
quality
of
service
tesco
has
said
the
deal
should
not
be
cleared
without
extensive
remedies
and
number
four
morrisons
has
raised
concerns
about
an
effective
duopoly
tesco
and
sainsbury
controlling
in
excess
of
percent
of
the
market
