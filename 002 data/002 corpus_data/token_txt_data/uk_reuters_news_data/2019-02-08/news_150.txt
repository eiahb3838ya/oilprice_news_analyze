the

a
call
to
airports
the

the
largest
operator
at

airport
said
the
disruption
affected
customers
and
forced
the
cancellation
of
more
than
of
its
flights
in
the
run
up
to
christmas
that
knocked
around
million
pounds
off
its
revenue
and
cost
the
airline
million
pounds
to
help
its
customers
we
were
disappointed
that
it
took
a
long
time
to
resolve
chief

lundgren

airports
have
gotten
this
as
a
call
and

be
better
prepared
going

gave
an
otherwise
upbeat
trading
update
and
said
bookings
were

striking
a
more
positive
tone
than
rival

it
had
increased
its
share
ownership
by
nationals
of
the
european
economic
area
to
percent
up
from
november
and
close
to
the
percent
threshold
needed

guarantee
its
right
to
operate
flights
after
britain
leaves
the
eu
on
march
gatwick
was
forced
to
close
its
runway
in
december
when
drones
flew
near
the
site
south
of
london
in
the
most
disruptive
incursion
by
unmanned
aerial
vehicles
at
any
major
airport
it
forced
the
cancellation
or
diversion
of
around
flights
affecting
passengers
over
three
days
in
total
analysts
at
rbc
said
they
had
trimmed
their
forecast
for
easyjet
by
percent
as
a
result
of
the
gatwick
disruption
but
retained
their
outperform
rating
as
far
worse
earnings
cuts
were
already
easyjet
shares
were
percent
higher
at
gmt
after
the
trading
update
drone
disruption
aside
easyjet
said
its
operating
performance
had
been
good
striking
a
contrast
to
ryanair
which
warned
lower
than
expected
winter
air
fares
would
hit
its
profit
easyjet
said
total
revenue
rose
by
percent
to
billion
pounds
in
its
fiscal
first
quarter
to
and
that
it
expected
headline
profit
before
tax
broadly
in
line
with
current
market
expectations
we
feel
that
this
environment
is
robust
and
solid
and
we
do
well
in
it
lundgren
said
adding
that
bookings
for
the
summer
were
ahead
of
last
year
despite
uncertainty
over
