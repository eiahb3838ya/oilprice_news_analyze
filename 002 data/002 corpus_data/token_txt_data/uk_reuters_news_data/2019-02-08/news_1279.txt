los
angeles
reuters
hundreds
of
newspapers
on
thursday
launched
a
coordinated
defence
of
press
freedom
and
a
rebuke
of
president
donald
trump
for
denouncing
some
media
organizations
as
enemies
of
the
american
people
a
central
pillar
of
president
trump
s
politics
is
a
sustained
assault
on
the
free
press
said
the
editorial
by
the
boston
globe
which
coordinated
publication
among
more
than
newspapers
the
greatness
of
america
is
dependent
on
the
role
of
a
free
press
to
speak
the
truth
to
the
powerful
the
globe
said
to
label
the
press
the
enemy
of
the
people
is
as
as
it
is
dangerous
to
the
civic
compact
we
have
shared
for
more
than
two
each
of
the
newspapers
including
some
in
states
that
trump
won
during
the
presidential
election
ran
an
editorial
which
is
usually
an
unsigned
article
that
reflects
the
opinion
of
an
editorial
board
and
is
separate
from
the
news
and
other
sections
in
a
paper
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
guarantees
freedom
of
the
press
trump
has
frequently
criticized
journalists
and
described
news
reports
that
contradict
his
opinion
or
policy
positions
as
fake
news
he
lashed
out
again
on
thursday
tweeting
the
fake
news
media
is
the
opposition
party
it
is
very
bad
for
our
great
country
we
are
winning
he
also
wrote
there
was
nothing
he
would
want
more
for
the
united
states
than
true
freedom
of
the
press
but
that
much
of
what
the
media
published
was
fake
news
pushing
a
political
agenda
or
just
plain
trying
to
hurt
people
honesty
wins
the
republican
president
s
comments
reflect
a
view
held
by
many
conservatives
that
most
newspapers
and
other
news
outlets
distort
make
up
or
omit
facts
because
of
a
bias
against
them
a
representative
for
the
white
house
did
not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for
comment
on
the
editorials
in
its
editorial
the
new
york
times
said
it
was
correct
to
criticise
the
news
media
for
underplaying
or
overplaying
stories
or
for
getting
something
wrong
news
reporters
and
editors
are
human
and
make
mistakes
correcting
them
is
core
to
our
job
the
times
said
but
insisting
that
truths
you
don
t
like
are
fake
news
is
dangerous
to
the
lifeblood
of
democracy
and
calling
journalists
the
enemy
of
the
people
is
dangerous
the
senate
unanimously
adopted
a
resolution
on
thursday
that
affirmed
the
vital
and
indispensable
role
played
by
the
news
media
and
declared
that
the
press
is
not
the
enemy
of
the
thursday
s
coordinated
editorials
were
criticized
by
some
in
the
media
including
a
cbs
news
commentary
that
described
them
as
a
act
of
journalistic
seriously
who
s
going
to
be
persuaded
by
this
effort
or
be
impressed
that
a
few
hundred
newspapers
can
hum
the
same
tune
who
s
even
going
to
notice
cbs
news
commentary
asked
politico
s
media
critic
jack
shafer
wrote
this
week
that
the
coordinated
editorial
response
was
sure
to
backfire
it
will
provide
trump
with
circumstantial
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
national
press
cabal
that
has
been
convened
solely
to
oppose
him
shafer
said
trump
will
reap
enough
fresh
material
to
whale
on
the
media
for
at
least
a
