reuters
reported
in
september
that
the
japanese
car
parts
maker
had
lined
up
around
billion
euros
in
financing
from
japanese
banks
to
fund
its
proposed
acquisition
of
magneti
marelli
the
japanese
car
parts
maker
which
private
equity
fund
kkr
bought
from
nissan
and
other
shareholders
in
has
been
in
talks
with
fca
for
months
and
made
an
initial
proposal
of
billion
euros
for
magneti
marelli
sources
have
said
previously
the
deal
was
being
structured
as
an
outright
acquisition
by
calsonic
to
create
a
global
auto
components
giant
worth
around
billion
euros
in
revenues
cut
costs
through
synergies
and
expand
the
customer
base
of
both
suppliers
the
people
added
marchionne
had
set
in
motion
a
process
to
spin
off
the
unit
and
distribute
its
shares
to
fca
shareholders
by
early
however
at
one
of
his
last
public
appearances
in
june
marchionne
said
fca
would
still
be
receptive
to
an
offer
if
it
properly
recognised
magneti
marelli
s
value
fca
does
not
spell
out
earnings
for
magneti
marelli
which
sits
within
the
carmaker
s
components
unit
alongside
robotics
specialist
comau
and
castings
firm
teksid
the
unit
employs
around
people
and
operates
in
countries
magneti
marelli
has
often
been
touted
as
a
takeover
target
and
fca
has
fielded
interest
from
various
rivals
and
private
equity
firms
over
the
years
but
so
far
a
deal
had
remained
elusive
as
potential
bidders
were
offering
too
little
or
were
only
interested
in
some
parts
of
the
business
fca
also
preferred
the
calsonic
offer
to
a
pure
private
equity
bidder
because
it
limits
the
risk
of
the
unit
being
broken
up
