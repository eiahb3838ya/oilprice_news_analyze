like
to
see
him
disappear
in
a
puff
of
smoke
and
now
a
small
town
in
england
plans
to
grant
them
their
wish
by
burning
a
comic
effigy
of
boris

as
part
of

saddam
hussein
boris
johnson
has
been
near
the
top
of
the
list
for
the
last
few
years
running
said
laura
lawrence
of
the
edenbridge
bonfire
society
he
does
have
a
tendency
to
put
his
foot
in
it
and
i
think
perhaps
this
year
he
might
have
put
his
foot
in
it
one
too
many
times
and
that
s
why
he
s
been
chosen
as
our
celebrity
effigy
for
the
high
effigy
took
artist
andrea
deans
six
days
to
make
he
wears
a
rosette
to
mark
the
bonfire
society
s
anniversary
and
is
portrayed
as
having
his
eu
cake
and
eating
it
i
wanted
him
to
come
across
scruffy
because
that
s
what
he
appears
most
of
the
time
wearing
his
suit
and
a
helmet
at
the
same
time
and
you
can
see
him
running
in
really
peculiar
shorts
that
s
why
we
put
those
on
she
told
reuters
because
he
appears
like
that
sort
of
character
and
also
i
think
boris
being
boris
he
ll
probably
see
the
funny
side
of
it
and
i
m
hoping
that
he
will
even
come
along
on
saturday
and
maybe
bring
