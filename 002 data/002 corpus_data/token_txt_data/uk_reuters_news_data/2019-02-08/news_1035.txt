kim
greeted
moon
with
hugs
and
handshakes
as
the
south
korean
leader
landed
in
the
north
s
capital
with
a
mission
to
rekindle
momentum
in
faltering
talks
between
washington
and
pyongyang
over

and
a
formal
end
to
the
korean

during

visit
kim
said
he
wanted
to
produce
a
bigger
outcome
at

pace
than
the
two
leaders
have
achieved
so
far
moon
himself
the
offspring
of
a
family
displaced
by
the
war
has
met
kim
twice
this
year
at
the
border
village
of
panmunjom
you
president
are
travelling
all
around
the
world
but
our
country
is
humble
compared
with
developed
nations
kim
told
moon
i
ve
been
waiting
and
waiting
for
today
the
level
of
the
accommodation
and
schedule
we
provide
may
be
low
but
it
s
our
best
sincerity
and
moon
said
it
was
time
to
bear
fruit
and
thanked
kim
for
his
hospitality
which
included
a
massive
welcome
ceremony
at
pyongyang
international
airport
featuring
a
large
honour
guard
and
a
military
band
during
their
motor
parade
through
pyongyang
s
landmark
ryomyong
street
a
new
residential
district
launched
last
year
under
kim
s
initiative
to
modernise
the
city
kim
and
moon
briefly
stepped
out
of
the
vehicle
to
greet
and
take
flowers
from
members
of
the
crowd
trump
has
asked
moon
to
be
chief
negotiator
between
himself
and
kim
according
to
moon
s
aides
after
trump
cancelled
a
trip
to
pyongyang
by
his
secretary
of
state
last
month
washington
wants
to
see
concrete
action
toward
denuclearisation
by
north
korea
before
agreeing
to
a
key
goal
of
pyongyang
declaring
an
end
to
the
korean
war
the
conflict
ended
with
an
armistice
not
a
peace
treaty
leaving
forces
including
south
korea
technically
still
at
war
with
the
north
south
korea
is
pinning
high
hopes
on
kim
s
remarks
to
moon
s
special
envoys
earlier
this
month
that
he
wants
to
achieve
denuclearisation
within
trump
s
first
term
in
office
ending
in
early
if
north
dialogue
is
restarted
after
this
visit
it
would
have
much
significance
in
itself
moon
said
before
his
departure
underscoring
the
challenges
ahead
north
korea
s
official
rodong
sinmun
said
on
tuesday
the
responsibility
falls
squarely
on
the
united
states
for
the
stalled
nuclear
discussions
it
is
due
to
its
nonsensical
irrational
stubbornness
that
other
issues
can
only
be
discussed
after
our
country
has
completely
verifiably
irreversibly
dismantled
our
nuclear
capabilities
without
showing
the
intention
to
build
trust
including
declaring
the
end
of
war
the
newspaper
said
in
an
editorial
on
wednesday
moon
and
kim
plan
to
hold
a
second
day
of
official
talks
after
which
they
are
expected
to
unveil
a
joint
statement
and
a
separate
military
pact
designed
to
defuse
tensions
and
prevent
armed
clashes

although
seoul
officials
said
they
did
not
expect
any

to
be
agreed
given
extensive
international
sanctions
the
united

is
pressing
other
countries
to
strictly
observe
sanctions
aimed
at
choking
off
funding
for
pyongyang
s
nuclear

says
it
has
destroyed
its
main
nuclear

missile
engine

site
and
has
halted
