italy's 5-star struggles to keep up with soaring salvini
rome
reuters
the
movement
emerged
as
italy
s
predominant
political
force
at
march
elections
allowing
it
to
enter
government
for
the
first
time
in
its
short
history
and
take
many
top
ministerial
jobs
five
months
later
it
is
discovering
that
governing
is
considerably
more
difficult
than
being
in
opposition
while
its
coalition
partner
the
league
has
overtaken
it
in
opinion
polls
driven
forward
by
its
leader
matteo
salvini
has
seen
its
own
support
slip
led
by
luigi
di
maio
the
party
has
already
had
to
jettison
some
campaign
pledges
has
seen
ministers
make
cabinet
debuts
and
has
struggled
to
corral
its
disparate
bloc
of
parliamentarians
the
worries
facing
coupled
with
salvini
s
surging
popularity
are
certain
to
embolden
the
league
as
it
pursues
its
agenda
confident
that
if
the
coalition
fell
apart
it
would
triumph
in
a
snap
election
the
setbacks
afflicting
show
the
problems
facing
unconventional
populist
parties
that
are
sprouting
up
across
europe
as
they
evolve
from
raucous
protest
movements
into
mature
rulers
but
the
initial
reversals
are
also
likely
to
harden
resolve
in
the
government
s
showdown
with
the
european
union
over
next
year
s
budget
as
it
seeks
to
show
its
voters
that
it
has
not
lost
its
radical
zeal
salvini
has
the
wind
in
his
sails
and
the
doesn
t
any
more
said
sergio
fabbrini
head
of
the
political
science
department
at
rome
s
luiss
university
the
based
its
electoral
success
on
promises
that
are
proving
very
hard
to
fulfil
and
you
can
see
that
it
is
struggling
to
stay
true
to
itself
he
added
di
maio
denies
his
party
is
in
any
difficulty
and
insists
it
has
scored
early
successes
including
curbing
parliamentary
privileges
and
bolstering
workers
rights
he
has
accused
the
press
of
being
prejudiced
against
denouncing
journalists
as
foul
jackals
and
alleging
that
newspapers
are
intent
on
stirring
trouble
between
himself
and
his
fellow
deputy
prime
minister
salvini
this
government
enjoys
a
great
consensus
in
the
country
and
the
other
parties
are
trailing
far
behind
us
he
told
a
group
of
foreign
journalists
earlier
this
month
but
the
polls
are
more
comforting
for
salvini
than
di
maio
while
the
league
won
percent
of
the
vote
in
march
against
percent
for
a
survey
put
salvini
s
party
on
percent
against
percent
for
a
reverse
that
pollsters
swg
said
should
sound
a
red
alarm
for
di
maio
daniela
aiuto
a
european
parliamentarian
who
last
month
quit
after
a
disagreement
with
its
leadership
says
salvini
s
success
is
based
on
his
mastery
of
social
media
as
he
pursues
his
hardline
crackdown
on
immigration
luigi
di
maio
has
ability
but
the
comparison
with
salvini
is
sadly
she
told
reuters
what
luigi
says
might
be
important
but
what
salvini
says
makes
insiders
say
the
two
coalition
leaders
get
on
relatively
well
speaking
to
each
other
every
day
and
regularly
exchanging
messages
via
whatsapp
but
relationships
between
the
two
parties
ministers
lawmakers
and
experts
are
much
more
fraught
while
the
league
has
years
of
experience
of
government
at
a
national
and
local
level
was
only
formed
in
and
has
much
less
administrative
league
lawmakers
such
as
igor
iezzi
say
this
inexperience
can
be
seen
in
parliament
they
must
learn
to
work
in
a
coalition
we
are
not
on
facebook
where
you
read
the
posts
and
then
change
your
mind
iezzi
told
reuters
complaining
that
counterparts
were
chopping
and
changing
their
ideas
on
amendments
if
you
work
days
on
an
amendment
you
can
not
then
go
back
on
it
you
need
to
grow
up
a
bit
he
said
salvini
has
found
it
easier
to
marshal
his
parliamentary
forces
than
di
maio
who
is
trying
to
enforce
order
by
threatening
to
expel
anyone
who
votes
down
coalition
proposals
one
such
dissenter
is
gregorio
de
falco
a
former
coastguard
commander
viewed
as
a
hero
in
italy
for
his
role
in
rescuing
survivors
from
the
stricken
costa
concordia
cruise
ship
in
his
decision
to
stand
as
a
candidate
in
the
march
ballot
was
seen
as
a
coup
for
the
party
but
he
has
now
voted
against
the
government
three
times
in
less
than
a
month
most
recently
in
opposition
to
a
proposed
amnesty
on
illegal
building
on
the
island
of
ischia
was
born
as
an
environmental
group
and
we
can
not
forget
this
now
we
are
in
government
de
falco
told
reuters
the
party
has
already
disappointed
its
environmentalist
wing
by
reneging
on
a
campaign
pledge
to
halt
the
construction
of
the
tap
gas
pipeline
project
in
the
puglia
region
it
explained
the
by
saying
italy
could
have
been
hit
by
fines
of
billion
euro
billion
if
it
had
killed
the
project
and
denied
knowing
this
before
taking
office
likewise
it
infuriated
some
supporters
by
letting
steel
giant
arcelormittal
buy
italy
s
troubled
ilva
steelmaker
rather
than
follow
through
on
promises
to
shut
down
the
firm
s
heavily
polluting
puglia
furnaces
these
decisions
dictated
by
realpolitik
have
put
on
the
defensive
and
made
it
determined
not
to
cede
ground
in
other
battles
most
notably
over
its
flagship
policy
the
citizen
s
wage
an
income
support
plan
for
the
poor
the
proposal
helped
win
up
to
percent
of
the
vote
in
the
underdeveloped
south
and
di
maio
insists
it
must
be
introduced
it
next
year
at
a
cost
of
around
billion
euros
the
league
which
draws
much
support
from
the
wealthy
north
and
is
ideologically
opposed
to
major
welfare
handouts
has
agreed
to
the
plan
in
principle
but
warns
its
implementation
will
be
complicated
this
is
creating
permanent
tensions
with
the
league
but
it
would
be
a
disaster
for
if
the
plan
fails
so
they
will
do
everything
possible
to
prevent
that
said
luiss
university
professor
fabbrini
when
it
comes
to
trying
to
impose
its
will
on
its
coalition
partner
has
one
important
handicap
in
a
country
that
has
seen
some
governments
since
world
war
two
coalition
parties
have
regularly
threatened
to
walk
out
of
administrations
if
they
don
t
get
what
they
want
but
such
threats
from
the
would
ring
hollow
under
party
rules
its
lawmakers
can
only
serve
two
mandates
which
means
di
maio
and
most
top
party
officials
will
not
be
allowed
to
stand
at
the
next
election
analysts
believe
this
means
they
will
do
everything
they
can
to
cling
to
office
di
maio
has
every
interest
in
keeping
the
government
going
even
though
it
can
not
give
him
everything
he
needs
this
puts
him
at
a
distinct
disadvantage
to
salvini
