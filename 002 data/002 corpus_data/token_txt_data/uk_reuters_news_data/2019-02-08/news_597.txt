explainer: what is equivalence? britain's banks face patchy eu access
london
reuters
britain
and
the
european
union
have
agreed
a
deal
that
will
give
london
s
financial
centre
the
same
basic
level
of
access
to
the
bloc
s
markets
after
brexit
that
is
already
offered
to
countries
including
the
united
states
japan
and
singapore
the
deal
is
based
around
the
eu
s
existing
system
of
financial
market
access
known
as
equivalence
the
eu
grants
foreign
financial
firms
market
access
if
it
deems
their
home
rules
equivalent
or
aligned
closely
enough
with
its
own
rules
it
means
foreign
firms
such
as
investment
firms
and
clearing
houses
can
serve
eu
customers
largely
from
their
home
base
and
avoid
having
to
set
up
a
subsidiary
in
the
eu
no
currently
inside
the
eu
all
financial
firms
in
britain
have
unfettered
access
to
its
customers
and
the
city
of
london
had
hoped
this
would
continue
after
brexit
but
not
all
financial
services
are
covered
by
equivalence
the
eu
has
no
such
regime
for
activities
including
commercial
bank
lending
and
deposit
taking
and
parts
of
the
insurance
sector
equivalence
largely
focuses
on
the
wholesale
market
such
as
securities
trading
leaving
out
much
of
the
retail
sector
that
is
why
many
banks
and
insurers
based
in
britain
have
pushed
ahead
with
opening
new
eu
hubs
to
avoid
losing
customers
britain
wanted
the
eu
to
offer
a
more
accommodative
version
of
equivalence
covering
a
broader
range
of
financial
activities
and
ensure
the
eu
could
not
end
access
at
short
notice
none
of
these
are
included
in
the
brexit
deal
britain
has
said
it
will
continue
to
push
for
broadening
equivalence
and
the
eu
has
privately
conceded
the
system
needs
reform
for
some
financial
firms
equivalence
is
better
than
no
access
at
all
as
it
could
mean
shifting
fewer
jobs
and
activities
to
eu
hubs
and
perhaps
continuing
to
centralise
some
back
office
operations
such
as
booking
trades
at
global
centres
in
london
normally
the
eu
will
not
grant
equivalence
to
foreign
firms
until
it
has
completed
lengthy
deliberations
about
four
years
in
the
case
of
one
derivatives
clearing
rule
the
deal
agreed
with
the
eu
would
effectively
fast
track
equivalence
determinations
during
the
transition
period
that
ends
in
december
such
early
notice
that
it
will
still
have
basic
access
to
the
eu
would
help
maintain
london
s
position
as
a
global
base
for
banks
what
s
a
there
could
be
some
political
fallout
from
a
deal
backers
of
brexit
say
leaving
the
eu
gives
britain
a
golden
opportunity
to
ditch
eu
financial
rules
such
as
curbs
on
banker
bonuses
in
order
to
keep
the
city
competitive
as
a
global
financial
hub
they
fear
that
under
equivalence
britain
will
end
up
as
a
having
like
norway
to
mirror
eu
regulation
without
having
a
say
on
them
british
financial
regulators
have
said
they
want
to
stay
aligned
with
eu
rules
but
be
granted
some
flexibility
to
make
changes
when
it
comes
to
maintaining
financial
stability
equivalence
will
cut
both
ways
britain
will
be
asked
by
eu
banks
insurers
and
investment
firms
to
grant
them
equivalence
there
are
several
large
branches
of
eu
banks
operating
in
london
that
will
want
to
avoid
having
to
convert
themselves
into
subsidiaries
a
costly
exercise
that
involves
finding
extra
capital
didn
t
britain
say
equivalence
is
a
yes
government
ministers
have
said
the
current
equivalence
system
is
opaque
and
unreliable
because
all
decisions
are
made
unilaterally
by
brussels
and
can
be
scrapped
at
days
notice
the
city
wanted
a
broader
system
of
market
access
known
as
mutual
recognition
whereby
britain
and
the
eu
accept
each
other
s
rules
across
a
broad
range
of
wholesale
market
financial
services
but
the
eu
rejected
this
yes
but
not
in
the
way
britain
wants
faced
with
having
to
continue
relying
on
a
foreign
financial
centre
from
next
march
the
bloc
and
france
in
particular
is
keen
to
tighten
conditions
for
granting
equivalence
in
order
to
keep
up
the
pressure
on
firms
to
shift
operations
to
the
eu
and
help
it
build
up
its
own
capital
market
foreign
clearing
houses
london
dominates
clearing
of
derivatives
will
have
to
grant
eu
regulators
access
to
their
inner
workings
if
they
want
to
serve
the
bloc
s
customers
foreign
investment
banks
face
having
to
have
more
operations
and
capital
in
the
bloc
on
the
bright
side
for
britain
the
scope
of
equivalence
was
substantially
increased
in
january
when
the
eu
updated
its
mifid
ii
securities
and
investment
rules
letting
banks
and
investment
firms
from
outside
the
bloc
undertake
a
wider
range
of
investment
and
trading
activities
