and
the

is
studying

the

ambassador
to
london
sulaiman
hamid
almazroui
said
we
have
an
extremely
close
partnership
with
the

because
of
the
strength
of
that
relationship
we
are
hopeful
that
an
amicable
solution
can

after
a

we
will
wait
to
see
what
happens
hedges
wife
daniela
tejada
told
reuters
after
the
ambassador
spoke
she
denies
he
is
a
spy
his
family
have
cast
him
as
a
talented
researcher
who
fell
foul
of
the
uae
s
security
and
justice
system
the
uae
cast
him
as
a
british
spy
who
was
given
a
fair
trial
for
grave
espionage
offences
we
hope
the
uae
now
looks
favourably
on
the
family
s
request
for
clemency
a
spokeswoman
for
britain
s
foreign
office
said
the
gulf
state
does
not
dictate
verdicts
to
its
courts
and
there
was
full
and
proper
legal
process
in
hedges
case
the
ambassador
said
there
had
not
been
a
five
minute
show
trial
as
he
said
some
media
had
reported
this
was
an
extremely
serious
case
we
live
in
a
dangerous
neighbourhood
and
national
security
must
be
a
top
priority
said
almazroui
adding
that
everyone
had
the
right
to
request
a
pardon
this
was
an
unusual
case
many
researchers
visit
the
uae
freely
every
year
without
breaking
our
laws
he
said
hedges
family
said
the
evidence
presented
against
him
consisted
of
notes
from
his
dissertation
research
matt

held
in
an
undisclosed
location
in
solitary
confinement
for
over
months
with
no
charge
no
lawyer
and
very
limited
consular
access
his
wife
said
the
judicial
system
in
the
uae
and
the
uk
can
not
be
compared
i
was
in
the

the

lasted
less
than
minutes
