vatican deal with beijing leaves some key questions unresolved
hong
city
reuters
a
landmark
deal
between
china
s
leaders
and
the
vatican
over
the
appointment
of
bishops
has
been
struck
without
beijing
taking
action
on
church
concerns
over
clerics
in
detention
catholic
church
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
say
the
agreement
which
gives
the
vatican
a
say
in
the
appointment
of
bishops
in
china
was
signed
last
saturday
but
details
have
not
been
made
public
three
sources
aware
of
the
substance
of
the
provisional
deal
say
the
plight
of
a
dozen
or
so
detained
priests
and
bishops
some
elderly
remains
unresolved
and
will
be
subject
to
vatican
efforts
beijing
has
provided
little
clear
information
about
their
fate
despite
repeated
vatican
requests
in
recent
years
the
sources
said
a
senior
vatican
source
said
the
precise
number
still
believed
to
be
in
detention
was
not
clear
some
of
those
held
are
feared
to
have
died
in
detention
according
to
catholic
priests
and
activists
who
monitor
the
situation
on
the
mainland
neither
china
s
foreign
ministry
which
has
been
leading
the
talks
with
the
vatican
nor
the
ministry
of
public
security
immediately
responded
to
requests
for
comment
a
vatican
spokesman
said
he
had
no
immediate
comment
the
justice
and
peace
commission
of
the
hong
kong
catholic
diocese
issued
a
statement
in
june
protesting
the
renewed
detention
of
bishop
cui
tai
from
hebei
province
in
april
urging
the
release
of
all
unreasonably
and
illegally
detained
clergy
they
also
highlighted
the
detention
of
baoding
bishop
james
su
zhimin
now
su
has
been
held
since
his
arrest
in
october
but
no
details
of
his
whereabouts
or
condition
are
known
the
reality
is
this
deal
is
a
small
step
a
very
small
step
there
is
much
hard
work
ahead
on
unresolved
issues
said
one
cleric
familiar
with
the
pact
hong
kong
priests
say
a
total
figure
of
clerics
under
detention
or
house
arrest
in
china
is
hard
to
pin
down
given
official
opacity
beyond
detentions
some
are
held
briefly
by
local
authorities
china
s
approximately
million
catholics
have
been
split
between
an
underground
church
loyal
to
the
pope
and
the
catholic
patriotic
association
while
some
critics
have
slammed
this
month
s
agreement
as
a
betrayal
that
could
finally
crush
the
underground
church
vatican
officials
said
failure
to
strike
the
deal
could
have
led
to
a
fatal
schism
between
chinese
catholics
there
are
many
other
points
and
concrete
matters
that
pertain
to
the
life
of
the
church
that
can
now
be
put
forward
said
father
federico
lombardi
a
former
papal
spokesman
who
followed
the
negotiations
closely
the
fact
that
a
positive
result
has
been
achieved
leaves
hope
that
others
can
follow
that
there
can
be
development
he
told
italy
s
catholic
sir
news
agency
another
issue
still
to
be
finalised
according
to
the
same
three
catholic
sources
is
the
future
roles
and
responsibilities
of
some
of
the
seven
bishops
ordained
by
beijing
s
church
without
vatican
approval
but
legitimised
by
pope
francis
to
clear
the
way
for
the
deal
two
of
the
seven
had
faced
earlier
vatican
investigations
into
allegations
they
had
wives
or
girlfriends
according
to
catholic
sources
contravening
the
vow
of
celibacy
taken
by
catholic
priests
they
are
expected
to
take
up
administrative
or
symbolic
roles
keeping
the
title
of
bishop
without
carrying
out
full
responsibilities
including
the
ordination
of
priests
the
sources
said
reuters
has
not
been
able
to
independently
confirm
the
personal
status
of
these
two
bishops
under
the
deal
the
government
will
no
longer
appoint
bishops
without
the
approval
of
the
vatican
which
will
be
given
candidates
chosen
by
catholic
communities
and
chinese
authorities
but
uncertainty
is
already
mounting
among
some
chinese
faithful
over
how
their
underground
body
will
integrate
with
the
church
father
bernardo
cervellera
editor
of
catholic
news
agency
asianews
said
that
underground
bishops
were
still
restricted
they
can
say
mass
but
not
move
around
their
dioceses
as
freely
as
they
wanted
missionary
priests
in
contact
with
underground
counterparts
in
recent
days
say
the
pressure
on
them
has
intensified
in
recent
months
i
think
of
the
endurance
of
the
catholics
who
suffered
it
is
true
that
they
will
suffer
there
is
always
suffering
in
an
accord
but
they
have
great
faith
pope
francis
said
on
tuesday
he
has
repeatedly
defended
the
deal
which
he
said
would
give
him
and
not
beijing
the
final
say
the
bishop
of
hong
kong
for
decades
a
vital
catholic
beachhead
on
the
edge
of
officially
atheist
china
on
saturday
expressed
his
reservations
over
the
pact
saying
time
and
more
details
were
needed
before
it
could
be
fully
judged
or
even
called
an
agreement
quoted
in
this
weekend
s
edition
of
the
sunday
examiner
the
city
s
catholic
newspaper
bishop
michael
yeung
referenced
lyrics
from
the
swedish
pop
group
abba
the
winner
takes
it
all
the
loser
s
standing
catholics
in
china
are
neither
radicals
nor
revolutionaries
instead
they
are
really
poor
people
he
was
quoted
as
saying
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
communist
government
targets
the
catholic
church
more
than
any
other
religious
group
in
bishop
yeung
who
told
the
paper
he
was
not
yet
aware
of
the
content
of
the
accord
did
not
respond
to
reuters
questions
a
hong
vatican
envoy
was
also
quoted
in
the
examiner
saying
that
the
deal
was
of
great
importance
but
more
negotiations
were
needed
to
ensure
more
freedom
and
autonomy
for
the
church
i
hope
the
agreement
may
also
bring
more
trust
between
the
two
parties
and
will
inspire
other
solutions
for
the
benefit
of
our
catholic
church
in
china
said
monsignor
ante
jozic
one
of
only
two
vatican
representatives
in
greater
china
under
communist
party
control
jozic
confirmed
his
remarks
to
reuters
but
said
he
could
not
comment
further
hong
kong
is
one
of
the
most
important
catholic
cities
in
asia
home
to
an
extensive
network
of
aid
agencies
missions
scholars
and
media
that
have
supported
catholics
in
china
and
elsewhere
while
the
vatican
instituted
similar
accords
with
communist
authorities
in
eastern
europe
and
the
former
soviet
union
during
the
cold
war
the
situation
in
china
differs
because
beijing
created
a
rival
brand
of
catholicism
through
the
patriotic
association
