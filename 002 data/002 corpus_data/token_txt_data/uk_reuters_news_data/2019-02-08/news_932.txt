new
reuters
with
oil
prices
hitting
fresh
highs
proposals
to
allow
the
united
states
to
sue
opec
nations
are
getting
a
fresh
look
in
congress
though
they
were
once
considered
a
longshot
to
becoming
law
a
senate
subcommittee
on
wednesday
will
hear
testimony
on
the
no
oil
producing
and
exporting
cartels
act
or
nopec
which
would
revoke
the
sovereign
immunity
that
has
long
shielded
opec
members
from
legal
action
the
bill
would
change
antitrust
law
to
allow
opec
producers
to
be
sued
for
collusion
it
would
make
it
illegal
to
restrain
oil
or
gas
production
or
set
those
prices
removing
sovereign
immunity
that
courts
have
ruled
exists
under
current
law
past
leaders
have
opposed
the
nopec
bill
but
the
possibility
of
its
success
may
have
increased
due
to
president
donald
trump
s
frequent
criticism
of
the
organisation
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
as
some
predict
that
brent
crude
the
international
benchmark
could
reach
a
barrel
before
long
opec
is
a
pet
peeve
for
him
said
joe
mcmonigle
senior
energy
policy
analyst

hedgeye
potomac
research
everybody
thinks
he
could
easily
support
saudi
arabia
is
lobbying
the
government
to
prevent
the
bill
s
passage
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
business
groups
and
oil
companies
also
oppose
the
bill
citing
the
possibility
of
retaliation
from
other
countries
opec
controls
output
from
member
nations
by
setting
production
targets
prices
are
up
percent
following
the
cartel
s
decision
to
cut
output
at
the
end
of
hitting
a
barrel
on
monday
and
lawmakers
have
trained
their
ire
on
the
group
saying
it
is
again
harming
consumers
and
represents
interference
in
free
markets
wednesday
s
hearing
before
the
senate
subcommittee
on
antitrust
competition
policy
and
consumer
rights
could
give
insight
into
the
executive
branch
s
stance
mcmonigle
said
one
of
the
witnesses
will
be
makan
delrahim
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
justice
department
s
antitrust
division
who
has
written
in
support
of
such
legislation
a
version
of
nopec
passed
both
houses
of
congress
in
but
was
shelved
after
president
george
bush
said
he
would
veto
the
legislation
chances
of
passage
this
year
are
slim
as
the
house
of
representatives
is
scheduled
to
be
in
session
only
days
the
rest
of
this
year
leaving
little
time
for
anything
but
legislation
like
keeping
the
government
funded
saudi
arabia
the
world
s
top
oil
exporter
is
worried
that
nopec
could
turn
into
another
justice
against
sponsors
of
terrorism
act
jasta
law
which
allows
victims
of
the
attacks
in
the
united
states
to
sue
riyadh
the
sources
said
the
jasta
law
is
seen
as
key
to
why
saudi
aramco
was
hesitant
in
publicly
listing
its
shares
on
markets
in
an
ipo
that
has
since
been
shelved
with
close
to
trillion
in
investments
in
the
united
states
riyadh
has
a
lot
to
lose
if
nopec
becomes
law
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
raised
concerns
about
it
with
officials
including
energy
secretary
rick
perry
during
private
meetings
in
recent
months
two
sources
told
reuters
on
condition
of
anonymity
earlier
this
year
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
american
petroleum
institute
told
congress
they
opposed
the
bill
saying
surging
energy
output
had
mitigated
opec
s
influence
since
the
renewed
sanctions
on
iran
this
may
other
nations
including
saudi
arabia
have
agreed
to
increase
production
however
that
has
not
yet
stopped
oil
s
upward
climb
