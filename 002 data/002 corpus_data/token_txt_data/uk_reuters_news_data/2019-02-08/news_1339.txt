london
reuters
glencore
said
it
would
favour
share
buybacks
over
after
it
reported
a
percent
rise
in
core
earnings
on
wednesday
just
below
analyst
forecasts
the
miner
and
commodities
trader
said
its
earnings
for
were
a
record
building
on
results
it
said
were
the
best
yet
but
also
that
higher
costs
and
lower
prices
for
cobalt
and
other
byproducts
ate
into
profits
ceo
ivan
glasenberg
said
market
conditions
were
likely
to
remain
volatile
many
mining
stocks
have
pared
gains
this
year
as
metals
markets
weakened
in
response
to
trade
tensions
and
uncertainty
about
chinese
demand
while
other
producers
have
warned
of
cost
inflation
glencore
s
share
price
has
come
under
additional
pressure
from
its
exposure
to
democratic
republic
of
congo
drc
and
a
department
of
justice
doj
investigation
days
after
it
announced
the
investigation
in
july
glencore
said
it
would
buy
back
shares
worth
billion
on
wednesday
it
said
further
buybacks
could
be
in
the
pipeline
as
the
best
way
to
reward
shareholders
right
now
buybacks
may
be
the
best
returns
we
can
get
glasenberg
said
on
a
conference
call
we
just
don
t
see
anything
out
in
the
market
we
look
opportunistically
at
m
a
strong
rebound
in
glencore
s
share
price
last
year
from
the
commodity
crash
of
was
based
on
the
company
s
exposure
to
battery
minerals
and
analyst
expectations
it
would
expand
through
deals
its
share
price
has
retreated
percent
this
year
glasenberg
said
the
stock
was
undervalued
making
buybacks
a
better
option
than
increasing
dividends
by
gmt
glencore
shares
were
flat
in
london
at
pence
the
company
s
adjusted
ebitda
earnings
before
interest
tax
depreciation
and
amortisation
of
billion
billion
pounds
missed
a
consensus
forecast
of
billion
billion
pounds
adjusted
earnings
before
interest
and
tax
ebit
from
its
marketing
division
of
billion
billion
pounds
up
percent
were
in
line
even
allowing
for
geopolitical
risk
many
analysts
also
say
glencore
is
undervalued
but
sven
reinke
lead
analyst
for
glencore
at
moody
s
credit
ratings
agency
said
legal
uncertainties
were
an
obstacle
for
a
potentially
higher
rating
glencore
s
strong
results
and
low
net
debt
of
billion
down
percent
meanwhile
were
in
line
with
moody
s
expectations
he
said
apart
from
the
risks
associated
with
the
doj
investigation
glencore
faces
higher
costs
in
congo
because
of
a
mining
code
signed
into
law
in
june
glasenberg
said
glencore
was
reluctantly
paying
a
higher
rate
royalty
of
percent
on
gross
revenue
for
copper
and
cobalt
compared
with
percent
on
net
revenue
previously
he
said
the
industry
was
negotiating
with
the
government
and
was
also
looking
into
legal
options
to
overturn
the
new
rules
already
as
glencore
this
year
ramped
up
copper
operations
in
congo
it
said
copper
costs
were
higher
than
expected
as
such
as
cobalt
lost
value
cobalt
s
use
as
a
battery
metal
drove
it
to
a
peak
of
per
tonne
in
april
but
it
has
since
dropped
to
around
as
chinese
production
has
created
a
surplus
