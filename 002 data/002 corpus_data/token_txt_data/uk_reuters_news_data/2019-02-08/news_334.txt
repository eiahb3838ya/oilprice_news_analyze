corbyn
on
wednesday
said
he
had
not
referred
to
prime
minister
theresa
may
as
a
stupid
woman
earlier
the
house
of
commons
erupted
in
anger
when
corbyn
appeared
to
mouth
the
words
stupid
woman
after
a
lively
exchange
with
may
during
prime
minister
s
question
time
today
i
referred
to
those
who
i
believe
were
seeking
to
turn
the
debate
about
the
national
crisis
facing
our
country
into
a
pantomine
as
stupid
people
he
told
parliament
later
i
did
not
use
the
word
s
stupid
woman
about
the
prime
minister
or
anyone
else
and
am
completely
opposed
to
the
use
of
sexist
or
misogynist
