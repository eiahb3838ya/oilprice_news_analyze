eu commission pushes back plan to end veto on digital tax to 2025
brussels
reuters
the
european
commission
on
tuesday
pushed
back
plans
to
end
individual
member
states
veto
power
on
the
introduction
of
a
proposed
tax
on
digital
revenues
by
five
years
to
in
a
proposal
on
wider
tax
reform
the
commission
recommended
eu
states
end
the
practice
that
requires
the
backing
of
all
members
to
approve
eu
tax
rules
contrary
to
other
fields
where
decisions
are
made
by
a
majority
the
eu
executive
proposed
that
in
some
sectors
such
as
environment
levies
eu
states
should
agree
quickly
on
whether
to
end
the
veto
however
for
the
digital
tax
whose
progress
is
blocked
by
some
eu
states
the
decision
to
end
the
veto
could
be
taken
by
the
end
of
it
said
pushing
back
the
deadline
from
as
indicated
in
an
initial
draft
seen
by
reuters
in
another
crucial
step
back
from
initial
plans
on
tuesday
the
eu
executive
led
by
former
luxembourg
prime
minister
juncker
decided
to
dismiss
a
legal
procedure
that
could
make
tax
reforms
easier
to
agree
prompting
lawmakers
to
dub
the
move
as
a
smokescreen
the
digital
tax
was
proposed
last
march
by
the
european
union
s
executive
arm
it
would
impose
a
percent
tax
on
online
revenues
of
big
digital
companies
which
are
accused
of
paying
too
little
by
routing
their
eu
profits
to
states
with
lower
taxes
like
luxembourg
and
ireland
however
the
plan
is
deadlocked
after
eu
finance
ministers
failed
to
agree
on
the
tax
in
december
despite
a
plan
to
salvage
the
proposal
by
narrowing
its
focus
to
companies
like
google
and
facebook
the
veto
power
has
blocked
many
key
tax
reforms
including
on
energy
issues
where
the
eu
still
allows
subsidies
to
diesel
despite
its
environmental
policy
deterring
its
use
an
eu
official
said
the
fight
against
tax
evasion
has
also
been
hampered
by
the
vetoes
the
commission
said
citing
the
resistance
by
a
group
of
small
states
spearheaded
by
luxembourg
to
introduce
common
savings
tax
rules
in
the
eu
the
cost
of
the
vetoes
on
tax
reforms
overall
are
in
the
hundreds
of
billions
of
euros
a
year
the
eu
document
said
ironically
the
decision
to
end
veto
powers
will
have
to
be
agreed
unanimously
by
all
eu
states
as
the
commission
refused
on
tuesday
to
recommend
the
use
of
a
treaty
article
that
would
drop
the
unanimity
rule
when
competition
in
the
eu
market
is
distorted
as
in
the
case
of
digital
taxation
invoking
this
rule
would
allow
decisions
on
tax
reforms
to
be
made
by
a
majority
of
states
a
commission
official
said
article
was
not
recommended
because
it
could
be
used
only
for
targeted
measures
and
could
face
legal
challenges
the
european
commission
is
putting
up
a
smokescreen
said
eu
lawmaker
sven
giegold
who
sits
in
the
eu
parliament
s
committee
on
tax
evasion
the
plan
to
overcome
unanimity
blockades
with
a
unanimous
decision
is
absurd
and
obviously
ineffective
he
added
his
fellow
green
party
member
bas
eickhout
called
the
move
an
empty
the
commission
in
its
document
estimated
that
failure
to
agree
a
reform
of
the
corporate
tax
base
which
was
first
proposed
in
has
hampered
eu
growth
with
losses
worth
billion
euros
billion
in
alone
the
lack
of
agreement
on
an
eu
financial
transactions
tax
first
rolled
out
in
has
also
cut
the
bloc
s
tax
revenues
by
billion
euros
a
year
