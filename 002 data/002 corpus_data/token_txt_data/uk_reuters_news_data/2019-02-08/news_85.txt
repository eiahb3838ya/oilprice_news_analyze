eu parliamentarians back visa-free travel for britons after brexit
brussels
reuters
a
european
parliament
committee
proposed
on
tuesday
that
britons
should
enjoy
travel
to
europe
after
brexit
regardless
of
whether
the
bloc
s
divorce
with
britain
goes
smoothly
or
becomes
a
damaging
abrupt
split
the
committee
s
decision
adopted
unanimously
with
votes
in
favour
must
be
endorsed
by
the
full
parliament
next
month
which
is
likely
as
other
eu
institutions
have
backed
a
move
to
relaxed
visa
requirements
for
britain
after
brexit
provided
london
reciprocates
the
parliamentary
motion
covers
both
a
scenario
under
which
prime
minister
theresa
may
breaks
the
deadlock
at
home
and
manages
to
get
the
divorce
deal
she
negotiated
with
the
eu
ratified
by
the
uk
parliament
as
well
as
a
brexit
it
will
also
have
to
be
agreed
to
by
the
eu
s
executive
commission
and
the
european
council
which
represents
all
member
states
of
the
union
eu
visa
exemptions
cover
short
trips
of
up
to
three
months
and
currently
some
countries
in
the
world
from
argentina
to
japan
to
ukraine
benefit
from
the
system
the
visa
waiver
is
designed
for
business
and
tourism
and
does
not
grant
the
right
to
work
in
the
eu
parallel
talks
among
eu
states
on
letting
britons
visit
without
visas
following
a
brexit
were
delayed
last
week
diplomatic
sources
said
after
spain
raised
objections
over
gibraltar
a
british
territory
to
which
madrid
lays
claim
spanish
diplomatic
sources
said
on
tuesday
that
madrid
would
insist
on
excluding
gibraltar
from
any
brexit
deal
as
it
plans
to
revive
its
bid
for
shared
sovereignty
over
the
rocky
outpost
the
dispute
between
madrid
and
london
has
already
threatened
to
derail
the
whole
brexit
negotiation
process
but
a
deal
with
prime
minister
pedro
sanchez
cleared
the
way
in
november
for
the
eu
states
to
approve
the
divorce
package
but
britain
is
struggling
to
ratify
the
deal
which
parliament
rejected
on
mps
seeking
alternatives
to
may
s
troubled
plan
will
hold
a
series
of
votes
later
on
tuesday
the
eu
insists
reciprocity
is
a
key
element
of
its
visa
policy
and
britain
has
also
said
it
wants
to
allow
citizens
to
travel
freely
without
a
visa
for
tourism
and
temporary
business
activity
after
brexit
some
countries
in
the
eu
s
east
are
nevertheless
concerned
that
britain
could
try
to
curb
their
citizens
travel
after
brexit
unease
among
britons
over
migrant
workers
from
those
and
other
poorer
eu
states
was
a
key
factor
in
the
narrow
referendum
vote
to
leave
the
eu
poland
romania
bulgaria
croatia
and
cyprus
have
long
complained
that
their
citizens
are
excluded
from
a
scheme
that
allows
most
europeans
to
travel
to
the
united
states
and
americans
to
visit
europe
without
needing
a
visa
