this

from

in
the
previous
midterm
elections
said
sheila
krumholz
the
centre
s
executive
director
one
reason
for
the
big
spending
trump
this
is
in
no
small
part
a
referendum
on
the
election
and
it
s
been
bolstered
by
the
role
of
women
the
metoo
movement
the
brett
kavanaugh
nomination
and
the
fact
that
so
many
women
are
running

the

california
s
district
is
one
of
the
most
competitive
republicans
have
held
the
seat
since
but
the
past
decade
has
seen
an
influx
of
newcomers
priced
out
of
the
los
angeles
housing
market
and
now
nearly
percent
of
the
district
s
residents
are
hispanic
democrats
set
their
sights
on
taking
the
district
after
presidential
candidate
hillary
clinton
won
it
by
seven
points
and
a
republican
representative
steve
knight
clinched
another
term
by
six
points
this
year
knight
has
been
outraised
and
outspent
by

entirely
funded
by
former
new

mayor
michael
bloomberg
has
spent
more
than
million
in
ads
supporting
hill
the

helped
the
political
newcomer
blanket
the

with
her
liberal
message
supporting
a

to
universal

an
assault
weapons
ban
and

prove
a
sword
district
voter
burke
said
she
had
leaned
toward
knight
then
the
avalanche
of
hill
ads
and
mailers
annoyed
burke
so
much
it
cemented
her
decision
to
cast
her
