after

of
his

terms
has
maintained
that
his
most
recent
ousting
in
july
and
subsequent
conviction
were
part
of
a
plot
against
him
by
the
powerful
military
and
the
judiciary
the
army
has
repeatedly
denied

army
chief
general
qamar
javed
bajwa
expressed
grief
and
heartfelt
condolences
to
the
bereaved
family
said
the
official
military
spokesman
up
until
her
husband
s
ousting
last
year
kulsoom
sharif
had
never
been
a
politician
but
she
memorably
led
protests
after
a
military
coup
that
ended
a
previous
sharif
administration
with
her
husband
jailed
by
general
pervez
musharraf
she
broke
through
a
police
barricade
that
had
been
set
up
around
her
home
in
lahore
in
july
in
an
attempt
to
prevent
her
from
leading
a
public
rally
she
managed
to
get
away
in
a
car
which
was
chased
by
the
police
for
several
miles
when
police
finally
surrounded
the
car
she
locked
herself
in
for
several
hours
in
a
standoff
until
police
finally
towed
the
vehicle
away
the
musharraf
regime
eventually
allowed
nawaz
and
kulsoom
sharif
to
leave
the
country
and
they
spent
years
in
exile
until
returning
in
to
contest
new
elections
after
musharraf
stepped
down
in
the
face
of
mass
protests
