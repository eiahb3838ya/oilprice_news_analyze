german antitrust watchdog to act against facebook - report
berlin
reuters
germany
s
antitrust
watchdog
plans
to
order
facebook
to
stop
gathering
some
user
data
a
newspaper
reported
on
sunday
the
federal
cartel
office
which
has
been
investigating
facebook
since
has
already
found
that
the
social
media
giant
abused
its
market
dominance
to
gather
data
on
people
without
their
knowledge
or
consent
the
bild
am
sonntag
newspaper
said
the
watchdog
will
present
the
company
with
its
ruling
on
what
action
it
needs
to
take
in
the
next
few
weeks
a
facebook
spokeswoman
said
the
company
disputes
the
watchdog
s
findings
and
will
continue
to
defend
this
position
the
investigation
is
being
closely
watched
amid
mounting
concerns
over
leaks
of
data
on
tens
of
millions
of
facebook
users
as
well
as
the
use
of
social
media
by
foreign
powers
seeking
to
influence
elections
in
the
united
states
the
german
watchdog
objects
in
particular
to
how
facebook
acquires
data
on
people
from
apps
including
its
own
whatsapp
and
instagram
services
as
well
as
games
and
websites
and
its
tracking
of
people
who
are
not
members
the
paper
said
it
is
still
not
clear
how
strictly
facebook
will
have
to
comply
with
the
german
order
noting
that
the
watchdog
looks
likely
to
set
a
deadline
for
compliance
rather
than
insisting
on
immediate
action
