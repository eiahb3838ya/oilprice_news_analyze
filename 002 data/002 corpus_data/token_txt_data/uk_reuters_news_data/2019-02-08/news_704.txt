million
exit
package
to
a

she
teared

the
allegation
in
the
new

times
story
which
he
said
contained
wild
exaggerations
about
his
compensation
google
did
not
dispute
the

organizers
said
about

many

are
workers
rights
and

victims
seven

sundar
pichai
speaking
an
hour
later
at
a
new
york
times
conference
in

said
he
was
taking
note
of
the
concrete
steps
workers
presented
to
improve
the
company
s
culture
and
human
resources
processes
i
want
to
make
sure
google
sets
the
bar
he
said
noting
that
a
lack
of
gender
and
racial
diversity
was
part
of
the
issue
we
re
grappling
with
it
as
with
many
organizers
and
other
employees
said
google
executives
like
leaders
at
the
dozens
of
companies
affected
by
the
metoo
movement
have
been
slow
to
address
numerous
structural
issues
such
as
unchecked
power
of
male
executives
they
want
google
to
publicly
report
its
sexual
harassment
statistics
and
end
forced
arbitration
in
harassment
cases
they
also
have
asked
that
the
chief
diversity
officer
be
able
to
directly
advise
the
board
rana
abdelhamid
who
works
in
google
cloud
s
marketing
division
in
san
francisco
told
reporters
that
the
walkout
was
about
safety
of
women
in
the
workplace
adding
that
google
s
historical
support
for
women
s
causes
caused
her
to
be
shocked
when
she
learned
of
the
payout
the
numbers
and
facts
don
t
match
with
the
intentions
of
google
on
equality
and
safety
for
underrepresented
groups
she
told
reuters
we
need
to
reprioritise
energy
and
really
focus
on
these
since
its
founding
two
decades
ago
google
has
been
known
for
its
motto
don
t
be
evil
a
dictum
preserved
in
its
worker
code
of
conduct
and
its
transparency
with
employees
about
corporate
strategy
but
employees
have
internally
organised
for
months
to
increase
diversity
and
improve
treatment
of
women
and
minorities
those
issues
have
been
top
of
mind
since
the
election
of
president
donald
trump
a
republican
stunned
silicon
valley
where
liberal
and
libertarian
policies
are
popular
tech
workers
have
become
more
vocal
to
protest
both
the
president
s
and
their
companies
stances
on
immigration
defence
and
discrimination
workers
have
said
that
they
are
driven
by
the
sense
that
their
technology
pioneer
employers
should
also
be
standard
bearers
on
socioeconomic
issues
we
all
know
that
the
status
quo
is
unacceptable
and
if
there
is
any
company
who
can
solve
this
it
is
google
said
thomas
kneeland
a
google
software
engineer
in
new
york
the
dissatisfaction
among
alphabet
s
employees
and
tens
of
thousands
contractors
has
not
noticeably
affected
the
company
s
share
price
but
employees
who
warned
they
would
demonstrate
again
if
needed
expect
alphabet
to
face
recruiting
and
retention
challenges
if
their
concerns
go
unaddressed
