italy
s
government
opened
an
investigation
on
thursday
into
the
country
s
biggest
operator
hours
after
saying
it
could
face
a
heavy
fine
or
lose
its
concession
over
a
bridge
collapse
that
killed
at
least
people
a
section
of
the
bridge
gave
way
on
tuesday
in
busy
lunchtime
traffic
plunging
dozens
of
vehicles
feet
below
and
engulfing
autostrade
per
l
italia
into
a
political
fire
storm
shares
in
the
operator
s
parent
international
atlantia
fell
by
as
much
as
percent
at
one
point
as
investors
spooked
by
threats
of
government
retaliation
dumped
the
stock
they
closed
down
around
percent
at
euros
shares
in
other
firms
such
as
sias
and
astm
also
fell
after
deputy
prime
minister
luigi
di
maio
said
the
state
would
have
to
take
over
the
country
s
motorways
if
could
not
do
the
job
properly
launching
its
investigation
late
on
thursday
the
transport
ministry
said
it
had
given
autostrade
days
to
show
it
had
met
all
its
contractual
obligations
adding
it
wanted
the
company
to
rebuild
the
bridge
at
its
own
expense
if
the
justifications
provided
by
the
company
were
judged
inadequate
rome
would
consider
it
a
breach
of
the
concession
terms
earlier
deputy
transport
minister
edoardo
said
autostrade
owned
by
italy
s
benetton
family
could
lose
its
concession
as
it
had
failed
to
ensure
the
viaduct
s
safety
the
options
we
re
looking
at
are
the
full
revocation
the
revocation
of
just
the
section
or
a
penalty
but
a
million
euro
million
penalty
is
too
low
rixi
told
reuters
under
the
terms
of
the
concession
autostrade
can
be
fined
up
to
million
euros
a
government
source
separately
suggested
italy
may
impose
a
fine
rather
than
withdraw
autostrade
s
concession
as
the
latter
could
involve
a
long
legal
fight
and
risk
the
government
being
ordered
to
pay
compensation
to
the
company
autostrade
says
it
made
regular
thorough
safety
checks
on
the
viaduct
part
of
a
motorway
linking
the
port
city
of
genoa
with
southern
france
and
had
used
experts
when
conducting
the
tests
and
inspections
autostrade
will
hold
an
extraordinary
board
meeting
on
the
crisis
next
week
a
source
close
to
the
matter
said
prosecutors
have
opened
an
investigation
into
the
reasons
behind
the
bridge
collapse
but
have
yet
to
publicly
identify
the
cause
italian
prime
minister
giuseppe
conte
has
declared
a
state
of
emergency
for
genoa
one
of
italy
s
busiest
ports
whose
main
land
corridor
with
france
has
effectively
been
severed
in
the
valley
below
the
shattered
structure
cranes
moved
away
chunks
of
debris
on
thursday
as
rescue
teams
searched
for
survivors
under
the
rubble
of
a
bridge
completed
in
and
overhauled
just
two
years
ago
genoa
s
chief
prosecutor
francesco
cozzi
said
people
were
still
missing
a
state
funeral
for
the
victims
will
take
place
in
genoa
on
saturday
officials
said
as
the
coffins
of
some
of
the
dead
were
laid
out
in
a
hospital
chapel
one
man
stood
in
silence
with
his
hands
on
the
coffin
in
front
of
him
other
relatives
were
comforted
by
family
members
as
they
wiped
away
their
tears
italy
s
ruling
coalition
has
threatened
to
break
eu
budget
rules
if
needs
be
to
repair
infrastructure
and
ensure
there
s
not
repeat
of
the
disaster
a
spokesman
for
the
executive
european
commission
rebuffed
any
suggestion
eu
spending
rules
were
crimping
action
by
italy
saying
rome
was
getting
billion
euros
from
eu
coffers
for
investments
in
network
infrastructure
in
even
without
this
tragedy
the
likelihood
of
the
italian
government
testing
the
eu
s
patience
with
respect
to
its
budget
rules
was
always
likely
to
be
there
cmc
markets
analyst
michael
hewson
said
and
we
ve
seen
that
in
the
way
that
the
investors
are
reacting
around
the
bond
markets
what
this
has
done
i
think
is
act
as
a
bit
of
a
lightning
rod
for
bonds
issued
by
atlantia
and
its
autostrade
per
l
italia
unit
have
fallen
sharply
since
tuesday
and
now
trade
at
record
lows
a
document
detailing
the
terms
for
billion
euros
worth
of
bonds
guaranteed
by
autostrade
show
that
an
early
termination
of
the
motorway
concession
would
give
bondholders
a
right
to
demand
an
early
repayment
bankers
and
analysts
said
atlantia
was
less
likely
to
bid
for
major
projects
abroad
given
the
threat
of
punitive
government
measures
against
its
autostrade
unit
autostrade
is
percent
owned
by
atlantia
and
accounts
for
around
pct
of
its
revenues
atlantia
is
percent
focused
on
handling
the
genoa
crisis
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
i
can
t
see
them
investing
any
resources
into
a
new
bidding
