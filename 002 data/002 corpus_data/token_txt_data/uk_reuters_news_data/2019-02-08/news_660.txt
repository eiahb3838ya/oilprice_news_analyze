irish foreign minister urges caution on brexit breakthrough
dublin
reuters
ireland
s
foreign
minister
tried
to
dampen
expectations
on
thursday
that
a
brexit
deal
might
be
imminent
and
said
it
would
be
wrong
to
assume
that
any
consensus
within
the
british
government
meant
that
an
agreement
had
been
clinched
let
me
just
say
this
in
terms
of
commentary
today
particularly
in
british
media
i
would
urge
caution
that
an
imminent
breakthrough
is
not
necessarily
to
be
taken
for
granted
not
by
a
long
shot
simon
coveney
told
a
conference
repeatedly
people
seem
to
make
the
same
mistake
over
and
over
again
assuming
that
if
the
british
cabinet
agrees
something
well
then
that
s
it
then
everything
is
agreed
this
is
a
negotiation
i
would
urge
caution
that
people
don
t
get
carried
away
on
the
back
of
rumour
in
the
coming
