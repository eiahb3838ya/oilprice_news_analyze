reuters
rose
farrell
was
an
determined
to
live
by
herself
in
paradise
california
a
caregiver
checked
on
her
daily
and
she
relied
on
a
walker
but
still
had
her
car
in
her
driveway
since
the
camp
fire
swept
rapidly
into
paradise
which
sits
atop
a
ridge
feet
above
a
canyon
cut
by
the
feather
river
farrell
s
family
has
been
unable
to
reach
her
the
hardest
part
is
just
waiting
to
know
what
happened
said
tom
perez
the
husband
of
farrell
s
granddaughter
california
s
deadliest
wildfire
roared
into
the
town
of
last
week
speeding
seven
miles
in
minutes
and
leaving
residents
little
time
to
flee
some
died
in
their
cars
in
a
chaotic
evacuation
as
gridlock
snarled
up
the
two
exits
out
of
town
farrell
is
one
of
people
listed
as
missing
while
the
death
toll
has
climbed
to
the
number
of
those
unaccounted
for
has
fluctuated
wildly
and
officials
warn
it
will
almost
certainly
change
over
the
weekend
the
butte
county
sheriff
s
office
initially
put
the
total
of
missing
people
at
many
of
whom
were
later
accounted
for
but
as
fresh
reports
from
relatives
came
in
the
list
grew
from
to
late
wednesday
jumped
to
by
thursday
morning
and
soared
to
as
of
thursday
night
in
some
cases
people
may
have
survived
but
not
yet
notified
the
authorities
or
relatives
may
not
yet
have
reported
people
missing
poor
cell
phone
coverage
after
the
fire
has
exacerbated
the
problem
in
a
mountainous
region
where
some
areas
got
little
or
no
phone
reception
even
before
the
fire
we
still
have
reports
coming
in
of
people
being
missing
and
of
people
being
found
said
miranda
bowersox
a
spokeswoman
for
the
sheriff
s
office
the
overall
number
will
go
down

short
term
we
expect
to
see
new
reports
of
people
