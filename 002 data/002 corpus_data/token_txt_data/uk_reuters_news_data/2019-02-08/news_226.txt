white house weighs emergency, army funds diversion for border wall - reports
washington
reuters
the
white
house
is
laying
the
groundwork
for
declaring
a
national
emergency
that
would
let
president
donald
trump
build
sections
of
a
wall
along
the
border
possibly
using
funds
from
the
army
corps
of
engineers
the
washington
post
reported
on
thursday
citing
two
unnamed
sources
nbc
news
in
a
similar
report
said
the
plan
called
for
building
miles
km
of
border
barrier
by
declaring
an
emergency
and
tapping
a
billion
billion
pounds
army
corps
fund
that
was
set
aside
for
disaster
relief
and
prevention
projects
such
a
strategy
which
reuters
could
not
immediately
confirm
independently
would
escalate
a
standoff
between
trump
and
democrats
in
congress
from
a
policy
dispute
to
a
test
of
presidential
power
and
likely
trigger
a
legal
challenge
pushing
the
impasse
into
the
courts
could
give
trump
an
escape
path
from
the
political
box
he
has
put
himself
in
by
demanding
that
any
legislation
to
end
a
partial
government
shutdown
include
billion
in
funding
for
his
wall
a
demand
that
congressional
democrats
oppose
the
federal
government
partially
shut
down
on
when
trump
and
lawmakers
failed
to
reach
an
agreement
to
fund
several
agencies
whose
funding
had
expired
for
reasons
unrelated
to
trump
s
wall
nbc

citing
unnamed
officials
said
trump
had
been
briefed
on
the
plan
involving
the
army
corps
while
flying
to
the
southern
border
on
thursday
a
white
house
official
denied
trump
had
been

on
the

the
pentagon
declined
to
comment
on
the
news
reports
the
nbc
story
is
totally
false
fake
news
but
doesn
t
mean
the

won
t
talk
to
them
at
some
point
white

spokeswoman
sarah
sanders
said
the

last
year
