the

southern
indian
state
of
kerala
s
worst

in
a

has
risen
to
a
government
official
said
with
rising
water
levels
likely
to
impact
rubber
and
other
plantations
in
the
region
torrential
rains
in
kerala
india
s
largest
rubber
producer
and
also
a
major
tourism
hub
have
left
over
people
homeless

and
disrupted
air

traffic
within
the
state
for
a
week
ten
people
died
today
said
sivasankar
an
official
at
the
chief
minister
s
office
so
far
people
have
died
in
the
most
recent
floods
over
the
course
of
a
rubber
output
in
india
the
world
s
sixth
biggest
producer
and
second
largest
consumer
is
likely
to
fall
percent
from
a
year
ago
to
tonnes
in
the
fiscal
year
to
march
according
to
radhakrishnan
a

s
automotive
tyre
manufacturers
association
told
reuters
with
industry
officials
saying
that
a
quick
rebound
in
local
rubber
output
is
unlikely
tyre
makers
like
mrf
jk
tyre
apollo
tyres
and
ceat
will
have
to
rely
more
on
imports
that
could
lift
india
s
imports
to
a
record
tonnes
due
to
high
demand
from
tyre
makers
budhraja
said
higher
imports
by
india
could
support
global
rubber
prices
and
lift
shipments
from
major
exporters
like

malaysia
indonesia
and
vietnam
