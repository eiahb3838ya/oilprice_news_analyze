women
serving
on
japan
s
biggest
warship
the
kaga
are
a
group
on
the
frontline
of
a
push
to
transform
the
japanese
navy
into
a
fighting
force
where
men
outnumber
them
more
than
to
one
the
maritime
self
defence
force
msdf
needs
more
women
because
falling
birth
rates
mean
it
has
too
few
men
to
crew
warships
in
home
waters
or
on
helicopter
carriers
such
as
the
kaga
sailing
in
foreign
waters
to
counter
china
s
growing
regional
influence
women
all
over
the
world
are
working
in
a
wider
number
of
areas
and
i
think
japan
needs
to
be
a
part
of
that
said
petty
officer
akiko
ihara
standing
beside
one
of
the
helicopters
she
helps
to
maintain
the
proportion
of
women
in
the
kaga
s
crew
is
about
percent
a
level
japan
is
targeting
for
the
military
overall
by
from
percent
now
that
would
still
fall
short
of
where
percent
of
people
in
uniform
are
women
and
britain
with
percent
we
all
work
in
different
teams
around
the
ship
but
we
are
all
friends
ihara
added
we
do
sometimes
moan
a
little
about
our
male
the
veteran
says
she
has
encountered
no
workplace
discrimination
and
would
challenge
any
man
who
thinks
women
are
unsuited
for
military
life
to
work
with
her
for
accompanying
package
click
on
more
women
recruits
are
making
the
sdf
a
more
rounded
organisation
said
ayako
yoneda
a
firefighter
and
engineer
on
the
kaga
when
i
first
joined
nine
years
ago
there
were
few
women
and
it
felt
like
men
then
didn
t
know
how
to
deal
with
us
she
said
i
think
the
men
now
see
things
more
from
our
perspective
the
sdf
has
become
a
gentler
nonetheless
the
women
do
face
sexual
harassment
in
july
the
navy
discharged
a
male
petty
officer
for
kissing
and
groping
three
women
sailors
over
several
months
japan
s
demographic
woes
are
forcing
it
down
a
path
taken
years
earlier
by
its
ally
which
lifted
a
ban
on
women
on
warships
in
the
msdf
which
let
women
crew
ships
a
decade
ago
could
soon
remove
the
last
major
barrier
to
female
sailors
by
ending
a
ban
on
submarine
duty
defence
ministry
sources
have
told
reuters
japan
has
one
of
the
world
s
largest
navies
with
crew
on
more
than
vessels
including
about
submarines
more
than
destroyers
and
four
helicopter
carriers
such
as
the
kaga
the
kaga
was
on
its
way
to
sri
lanka
after
drills
in
the
contested
south
china
sea
as
part
of
a
deployment
in
waters
stretching
from
the
western
pacific
to
the
indian
ocean
commissioned
in
it
is
among
a
new
generation
of
warships
designed
to
accommodate
mixed
crews
with
more
toilets
and
bathrooms
than
older
vessels
signs
at
the
entrance
to
the
women
s
segregated
sleeping
quarters
warn
men
to
keep
out
the
women
inside
carry
electronic
pagers
that
can
be
contacted
via
numerical
keypads
beside
the
doors
those
better
facilities
and
privacy
safeguards
will
draw
more
women
to
sign
up
the
msdf
hopes
japan
s
navy
struggles
more
to
find
recruits
than
the
air
force
or
army
as
young
people
balk
at
the
prospect
of
being
cut
off
from
social
media
networks
on
long
deployments
in
for
example
the
airforce
received
applications
versus
just
for
the
msdf
even
though
both
have
about
the
same
number
of
enlisted
personnel
miku
ihara
a
woman
cadet
on
the
kaga
says
she
reads
books
or
studies
when
but
misses
access
to
line
and
instagram
sailors
are
limited
to
sending
four
text
emails
every
day
when
at
sea
you
just
have
to
get
used
to
not
having
it
and
make
the
most
of
it
when
you
do
she
added
the
presence
of
women
on
board
has
had
one
unexpected
benefit
on
the
men
that
report
to
him
says
command
master
chief
yasuharu
tohno
the
most
senior
enlisted
sailor
on
board
they
shave
regularly
and
iron
their
clothes
said
tohno
who
joined
up
to
an
fleet
years
ago
