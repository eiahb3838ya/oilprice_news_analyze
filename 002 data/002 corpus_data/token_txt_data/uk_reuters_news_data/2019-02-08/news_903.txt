tens
of
thousands
marched
through
the
streets
of
edinburgh
on
saturday
to
show
support
for
scottish
independence
from
the
united
kingdom
a
cause
scottish
nationalists
say
has
drawn
strength
from
britain
s
struggles
to
leave
the
european
union
the
campaigners
waved
giant
blue
scotland
flags
and
sported
kilts
as
they
congregated
in
a
park
near
the
scottish
parliament
building
the
scottish
national
party
snp
which
backs
secession
from
the
uk
and
has
almost
half
the
seats
in
the
country
s
devolved
parliament
starts
its
annual
conference
on
sunday
a
reuters
journalist
at
the
march
estimated
there
were
several
tens
of
thousands
of
people
present
there
were
a
handful
of
waving
british
flags
scots
voted
to
stay
in
the
european
union
in
by
a
large
margin
but
britain
as
a
whole
voted
to
leave
the
brexit
process
has
since
put
scotland
s
devolved
nationalist
government
increasingly
at
loggerheads
with
the
uk
s
conservative
leadership
scotland
rejected
independence
by
a
percentage
point
margin
in
a
referendum
most
polls
show
public
support
for
scottish
independence
from
the
uk
stuck
at
the
same
percent
level
it
has
been
since
the
vote
although
a
recent
poll
showed
backing
for
a
split
from
the
uk
has
ticked
up
in
a
sign
of
discontent
over
brexit
