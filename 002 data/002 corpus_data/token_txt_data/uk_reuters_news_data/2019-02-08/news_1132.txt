exclusive - right-wing sites swamp sweden with 'junk news' in tight election race
reuters
one
in
three
news
articles
shared
online
about
the
upcoming
swedish
election
come
from
websites
publishing
deliberately
misleading
information
most
with
a
focus
on
immigration
and
islam
oxford
university
researchers
say
their
study
published
on
thursday
points
to
widespread
online
disinformation
in
the
final
stages
of
a
campaign
which
could
mark
a
lurch
to
the
right
in
one
of
europe
s
most
prominent
liberal
democracies
the
authors
from
the
oxford
internet
institute
labelled
certain
websites
junk
news
based
on
a
range
of
detailed
criteria
reuters
found
the
three
most
popular
sites
they
identified
have
employed
former
members
of
the
sweden
democrats
party
one
has
a
former
mp
listed
among
its
staff
it
was
not
clear
whether
the
sharing
of
junk
news
had
affected
voting
intentions
in
sweden
but
the
study
helps
show
the
impact
platforms
such
as
twitter
and
facebook
have
on
elections
and
how
domestic
or
foreign
groups
can
use
them
to
exacerbate
sensitive
social
and
political
issues
prime
minister
stefan
lofven
whose
social
democrats
have
dominated
politics
since
but
are
now
unlikely
to
secure
a
ruling
majority
told
reuters
the
spread
of
false
or
distorted
information
online
risked
shaking
the
foundations
of
democracy
if
left
unchecked
the
institute
a
department
of
oxford
university
analysed
tweets
about
the
swedish
election
from
a
period
in
august
it
counted
articles
shared
from
websites
it
identified
as
junk
news
sources
defined
as
outlets
which
deliberately
publish
misleading
deceptive
or
incorrect
information
purporting
to
be
real
news
roughly
speaking
for
every
two
professional
content
articles
shared
one
junk
news
article
was
shared
junk
news
therefore
constituted
a
significant
part
of
the
conversation
around
the
swedish
general
election
it
said
a
twitter
spokesman
declined
to
comment
on
the
results
of
the
study
facebook
where
interactions
between
users
are
harder
to
track
said
it
was
working
with
swedish
officials
to
help
voters
spot
disinformation
it
has
also
partnered
with
viralgranskaren
an
arm
of
sweden
s
metro
newspaper
to
identify
demote
and
counterbalance
false
news
on
its
site
joakim
wallerstein
head
of
communications
for
the
sweden
democrats
said
he
had
no
knowledge
of
or
interest
in
the
party
sympathies
of
media
outlets
asked
to
comment
on
his
party
s
relationship
with
the
sites
identified
by
the
study
he
said
he
had
been
interviewed
by
one
of
them
once
i
think
it
is
strange
that
a
foreign
institute
is
trying
to
label
various
news
outlets
in
sweden
as
junk
news
and
release
such
a
report
in
connection
to
an
election
he
said
swedish
security
officials
say
there
is
currently
no
evidence
of
a
coordinated
online
attempt
by
foreign
powers
to
sway
the
vote
despite
repeated
government
warnings
about
the
threat
but
mikael
tofvesson
head
of
the
counter
influence
team
at
the
swedish
civil
contingencies
agency
msb
a
government
agency
tasked
with
safeguarding
the
election
said
the
widespread
sharing
of
false
or
distorted
information
makes
countries
more
vulnerable
to
hostile
influence
operations
incorrect
and
biased
reporting
promotes
a
harder
harsher
tone
in
the
debate
which
makes
it
easier
to
throw
in
disinformation
and
other
deceptive
tools
he
said
neudert
a
researcher
from
the
oxford
internet
institute
s
project
on
computational
propaganda
said
most
of
the
junk
news
in
sweden
supported
policies
and
was
largely
focused
on
issues
around
immigration
and
islam
the
top
three
junk
news
sources
identified
by
the
study
websites
samhallsnytt
nyheter
idag
and
fria
tider
accounted
for
more
than
percent
of
the
junk
news
content
samhallsnytt
received
donations
through
the
personal
bank
account
of
a
sweden
democrat
member

it
operated

who
also
previously
ran
the
party
s
youth
wing
is
listed
on
the
samhallsnytt
website
as
a
columnist
samhallsnytt
often
publishes
articles
saying
sweden
is
under
threat
from
islam
in
june
for
example
it
said
a
youth
soccer
tournament
in
the
city
had
banned
pork
as
haram
or
forbidden
under
islamic
law
the
article
is
still
online
with
the
headline
islam
is
the
new
foundation
of
the
gothia
cup
pork
proclaimed
haram
a
tournament
organiser
told
the
dagens
nyheter
newspaper
that
caterers
had
not
served
pork
for
more
than
years
for
practical
reasons
and
there
was
no
ban
against
eating
or
selling
pork
at
the
event
samhallsnytt
and
fria

did
not
respond
to
repeated
requests
for
comment
commenting
before
the
oxford
study
was
published
nyheter
idag
founder
chang
frick
disputed
the
junk
news
label
and
said
his
website
followed
ethical
journalistic
practices
citing
its
membership
of
sweden
s
press
council
body
yes
we
put
our
editorial
perspective
on
news
of
course
like
everyone
else
he
said
if
you
are
doing
a
tabloid
you
can
not
have
dry
boring
headlines
it
should
have
some
punch
to
it
but
we
do
not
lie
we
do
not
make
false
social
media
companies
have
come
under
increasing
pressure
to
tackle
disinformation
on
their
platforms
following
accusations
that
russia
and
iran
tried
to
meddle
in
domestic
politics
in
the
united
states
europe
and
elsewhere
moscow
and
tehran
deny
the
allegations
a
report
by
the
swedish
defence
research
institute
last
week
said
the
number
of
automated
twitter
accounts
discussing
the
upcoming
election
almost
doubled
in
july
from
the
previous
month
such
bot
accounts
shared
articles
from
samhallsnytt
and
fria
tider
more
frequently
than
real
people
the
report
said
and
were
percent
more
likely
to
express
support
for
the
sweden
democrats
facebook
said
its
work
with
viralgranskaren
to
fact
check
content
on
its
sites
helped
it
quickly
identify
false
the
company
declined
to
give
specific
figures
about
the
amount
or
sources
of
false
news
it
had
recorded
around
the
swedish
election
but
said
any
flagged
content
is
given
a
lower
position
on
its
site
a
practice
known
as
downranking
which
it
says
cuts
views
by
percent
users
who
see
disputed
articles
are
also
shown
other
sources
of
verified
information
it
said
in
a
blog
post
on
its
website
twitter
says
it
should
not
be
the
arbiter
of
truth
but
the
msb
s
counter
influence
team
s
head
tofvesson
said
there
had
been
a
positive
increase
in
the
work
of
facebook
twitter
and
other
social
media
companies
to
help
safeguard
the
election
largely
via
better
communication
and
coordination
with
local
authorities
