soaring profit fails to quell barclays investment bank debate
london
reuters
barclays
pretax
profits
almost
trebled
in
the
absence
of
hefty
payouts
for
legal
problems
but
the
british
lender
faced
further
questions
about
the
role
of
investment
banking
in
its
strategy
barclays
reported
pretax
profit
of
billion
pounds
billion
for
the
quarter
up
from
million
pounds
a
year
ago
and
higher
than
the
billion
average
of
analysts
estimates
compiled
by
the
bank
the
improved
profitability
showed
years
of
restructuring
starting
to
pay
off
for
barclays
one
of
the
big
five
that
dominate
the
banking
industry
in
britain
but
little
improvement
to
income
at
its
investment
bank
brought
the
performance
of
that
part
of
the
business
back
into
focus
after
questions
raised
by
activist
investor
edward
bramson
it
is
the
first
quarter
for
some
time
with
no
significant
litigation
or
conduct
charges
restructuring
costs
or
other
exceptional
expenses
which
hit
profitability
american
ceo
jes
staley
said
in
a
statement
income
in
the
investment
bank
rose
just
percent
in
the
first
half
of
largely
due
to
outperformance
in
the
equities
division
where
revenues
rose
by
percent
bolstered
by
strong
sales
of
derivatives
products
barclays
shares
initially
rose
on
thursday
but
were
down
percent
by
gmt
against
a
percent
fall
in
the
broader
stoxx
europe
banks
index
if
you
could
invest
in
barclays
excluding
the
investment
bank
it
would
be
a
great
investment
sadly
you
can
not
and
it
now
looks
like
is
shaping
up
to
be
another
strong
start
followed
by
weak
second
half
analyst
edward
firth
at
broker
kbw
said
the
barclays
investment
banking
performance
compared
favorably
with
european
peers
which
have
struggled
in
recent
months
but
paled
in
comparison
with
peers
which
have
reported
their
best
revenues
since
staley
faces
a
call
to
cut
back
the
trading
arm
of
the
investment
bank
from
bramson
the
new
york
financier
who
disclosed
a
surprise
percent
stake
in
barclays
in
february
bramson
has
argued
in
presentations
to
his
investors
that
the
lender
should
pare
parts
of
the
investment
bank
that
do
not
directly
serve
corporate
clients
we
are
in
conversations
with
bramson
i
have
met
him
and
we
look
forward
to
meeting
him
post
these
results
but
he
has
not
outlined
what
his
strategy
is
to
us
staley
told
reporters
on
a
conference
call
barclays
core
capital
ratio
a
key
measure
of
financial
strength
rose
to
percent
just
above
analysts
average
forecast
of
percent
that
number
had
been
depleted
by
fines
and
misconduct
costs
and
was
a
source
of
concern
for
investors
in
recent
months
fuelling
speculation
the
bank
might
need
to
raise
fresh
capital
the
bank
said
it
would
pay
an
interim
dividend
of
pence
per
share
above
analysts
expectations
and
above
the
pence
paid
at
the
same
time
a
year
ago
barclays
still
faces
a
raft
of
problems
that
threaten
to
dent
its
numbers
in
future
the
uk
s
serious
fraud
office
is
seeking
to
resurrect
its
prosecution
of
barclays
over
undisclosed
payments
to
qatari
investors
and
the
bank
faces
a
host
of
investigations
into
interest
rate
manipulation
and
its
conduct
in
foreign
exchange
trading
barclays
separately
announced
on
thursday
it
is
taking
a
minority
stake
in
marketinvoice
a
financial
technology
firm
which
allows
small
businesses
to
borrow
money
secured
against
invoices
to
their
customers
