vodafone
the
world
s
second
largest
mobile
operator
said
it
was
pausing
the
deployment
of
huawei
equipment
in
its
core
networks
until
western
governments
give
the
chinese
firm
full
security
clearance
the
united
states
and
some
allies
including
australia
and
new
zealand
have
banned
huawei
from
networks
because
of
alleged
ties
to
the
chinese
government
while
the
firm
has
denied
that
its
technology
could
be
used
by
beijing
for
spying
vodafone
s
chief
executive
nick
read
said
on
friday
after
reporting
results
that
the
debate
was
playing
out
at
a
too
simplistic
level
adding
that
huawei
was
an
important
player
in
an
equipment
market
which
it
dominates
along
with
ericsson
sweden
s
ericsson
and
nokia
we
have
decided
to
pause
further
huawei
in
our
core
whilst
we
engage
with
the
various
agencies
and
governments
and
huawei
just
to
finalize
the
situation
of
which
i
feel
huawei
is
really
open
and
working
hard

poland
is
set
to
exclude
huawei
from
after
it
arrested
a
huawei
executive
earlier
this
month
on
spying
allegations
huawei
fired
the
man
who
has
denied
wrongdoing
europe
s
mobile
industry
would
face
higher
costs
and
delays
to
faster
networks
if
authorities
imposed
a
blanket
ban
on
huawei
equipment
particularly
the
radio
technology
deployed
on
mobile
towers
vodafone
s
read
said
operators
in
europe
such
as
bt
and
orange
have
already
removed
huawei
s
equipment
or
taken
steps
to
limit
its
future
use
read
said
huawei
s
equipment
was
used
in
vodafone
s
core
which
he
described
as
the
intelligent
part
of
the
network
in
spain
and
some
other
smaller
markets
european
governments
and
security
agencies
had
not
pressurized
vodafone
into
taking
the
step
but
the
noise
level
had
increased
and
the
debate
now
needed
more
facts
read
said
adding
that
governments
in
africa
and
the
middle
east
where
vodafone
also
uses
huawei
had
not
raised
concerns
a
spokesman
for
huawei
which
become
the
world
s
biggest
telecoms
equipment
maker
earlier
this
decade
despite
being
shut
out
of
the
market
said
it
had
been
a
strategic
partner
to
vodafone
since
huawei
is
focused
on
supporting
vodafone
s
network
rollouts
of
which
the
core
is
a
small
proportion
we
are
grateful
to
vodafone
for
its
support
of
huawei
and
we
will
endeavor
to
live
up
to
the
trust
placed
in
us
he
said
however
read
said
that
vodafone
had
already
agreed
terms
with
a
range
of
suppliers
so
moving
away
from
huawei
in
parts
of
the
would
not
incur
additional
costs
shares
in
vodafone
fell
after
it
reported
a
deterioration
in
its
key
revenue
measure
in
the
third
quarter
down
basis
points
to
percent
reflecting
price
competition
in
spain
and
italy
and
a
slowdown
in
south
africa
analysts
had
expected
growth
of
percent
and
the
stock
fell
to
its
lowest
level
since
july
after
the
update
trading
down
percent
at
pence
at
gmt
vodafone
said
however
that
competition
in
the
spanish
and
italian
markets
had
moderated
through
the
quarter
and
it
improved
its
level
of
churn
or
the
number
of
customers
leaving
by
two

points
the
company
s
chief
financial
officer
margherita
della
valle
said
the
performance
improvements
would
start
to
show
in
the
top
line
after
the
current
quarter
we
expect
as
we
enter
into
the
next
fiscal
year
to
start
seeing
the
benefits
in
terms
of
revenue
growth

analysts
at

vodafone
performed
well
in
net
adds
and
churn
across
europe
but
they
expected
fourth
quarter
service
revenue
to
drop
to
percent
driven
by
weakness
in
spain
and
tougher
comparatives
in
britain
this
is
disappointing
relative
to
prior
comments
that
service
revenues
would
be
similar
to
the
percent
seen
in

said
vodafone

its
guidance
for
