charlotte
reuters
president
donald
trump
accused
the
news
media
on
friday
of
using
reporting
on
the
suspect
in
least
bombs
sent
to
some
of
his
prominent
critics
to
score
political
points
against
him
hours
after
a
trump
supporter
cesar
sayoc
was
arrested
in
florida
in
the
bomb
case
trump
told
a
political
rally
in
charlotte
north
carolina
that
political
violence
must
never
be
tolerated
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
stop
it
he
said
but
any
major
attempt
to
heal
political
divisions
was
quickly
set
aside
as
trump
renewed
attacks
on
his
usual
targets
the
news
media
and
his
democratic
opponents
we
have
seen
an
effort
by
the
media
in
recent
hours
to
use
the
sinister
actions
of
one
individual
to
score
political
points
against
me
and
the
republican
party
trump
said
trump
appeared
to
be
commenting
on
cable
news
blanket
coverage
of
the
bomb
case
and
how
the
people
targeted
are
frequently
criticized
by
the
president
trump
was
in
charlotte
campaigning
for
republican
candidates
ahead
of
the
hotly
contested
congressional
elections
with
republicans
are
trying
to
hang
on
to
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
some
in
the
crowd
on
friday
quickly
chimed
in
with
a
cry
that
is
a
familiar
one
at
trump
s
political
rallies
cnn
trump
paused
while
the
cnn
chant
continued
then
added
and
they
do
have
a
major
role
to
play
as
far
as
tone
the
media
s
constant
unfair
coverage
and
negative
attacks
only
serve
to
drive
people
apart
and
to
undermine
healthy
when
trump
criticized
democrats
the
crowd
chanted
lock
her
up
a
refrain
from
the
republican
president
s
campaign
when
he
called
democratic
opponent
hillary
clinton
crooked
trump
again
referred
to
clinton
as
crooked
hillary
on
friday
night
when
he
listed
democrats
who
supposedly
had
supported
building
a
wall
on
the
border
with
mexico
clinton
was
the
target
of
one
of
the
bombs
sent
this
week
which
was
intercepted
during
a
routine
mail
screening
they
re
gon
na
be
reporting
about
you
tonight
trump
told
the
crowd
in
north
carolina
trump
said
republicans
did
not
try
to
seek
political
gain
over
the
democrats
when
a
supporter
of
democratic
socialist
bernie
sanders
opened
fire
on
congressional
republicans
at
a
baseball
field
last
year
and
severely
wounded
representative
steve
scalise
we
did
not
use
that
heinous
attempt
at
mass
murder
for
political
gain
because
that
would
have
been
wrong
nor
do
we
blame
the
democrat
party
every
time
radical
leftists
seize
and
destroy
public
property
and
unleash
violence
and
mayhem
he
said
trump
made
similar
comments
on
thursday
blaming
the
news
media
for
stirring
up
anger
and
hateful
political
rhetoric
as
two
more
suspicious
packages
were
discovered
in
a
post
on
twitter
he
referred
to
purposely
false
and
inaccurate
reporting
of
the
mainstream
trump
hinted
earlier
on
friday
in
a
tweet
that
the
news
media
s
coverage
of
the
bomb
case
was
taking
attention
away
from
the
midterm
elections
at
a
time
when
republicans
may
be
hitting
their
stride
