ireland says brexit backstop alternatives tested, none work
dublin
reuters
brexit
negotiators
have
spent
two
years
looking
at
alternatives
to
the
backstop
insurance
policy
to
avoid
a
hard
border
on
the
island
of
ireland
and
have
not
found
any
that
work
irish
foreign
minister
simon
coveney
said
on
wednesday
british
lawmakers
ordered
prime
minister
theresa
may
on
tuesday
to
renegotiate
the
divorce
deal
she
struck
with
the
european
union
in
november
to
remove
the
backstop
which
would
require
some
eu
rules
to
apply
in
northern
ireland
until
an
alternative
plan
can
be
found
to
keep
the
border
open
brexit
minister
stephen
barclay
said
possible
options
to
resolve
the
issue
included
time
limits
exit
clauses
and
technological
solutions
but
coveney
told
national
broadcaster
rte
that
none
of
those
proposals
were
new
we
have
been
through
all
of
these
things
we
have
tested
them
and
we
have
found
that
they
do
not
stand
up
to
scrutiny
and
now
we
have
a
british
prime
minister
advocating
again
for
the
same
things
that
were
tested
coveney
said
what
we
are
being
asked
to
do
here
is
to
compromise
on
a
solution
that
works
and
to
replace
it
with
wishful
thinking
that
s
what
s
being
asked
of
the
irish
government
and
we
won
t
do
may
has
said
she
will
seek
legally
binding
changes
to
the
divorce
deal
but
has
been
met
with
a
blunt
response
from
the
eu
with
european
council
president
donald
tusk
among
others
backing
dublin
in
saying
it
was
not
up
for
renegotiation
coveney
said
there
were
mechanisms
to
get
around
some
of
the
challenges
may
faces
but
the
only
way
to
do
so
was
through
the
accompanying
political
declaration
on
future
ties
unlike
the
binding
divorce
agreement
the
declaration
can
be
renegotiated
to
ease
concerns
on
the
backstop
he
said
however
both
sides
were
running
out
of
road
to
prevent
britain
crashing
out
of
the
bloc
at
the
end
of
march
without
an
agreement
he
added
coveney
also
challenged
may
to
stand
by
previous
statements
that
the
backstop
was
necessary
to
rule
out
a
return
of
checks
between
northern
ireland
and
ireland
he
rejected
any
view
in
london
that
the
potential
economic
damage
to
ireland
from
a
no
deal
brexit
would
weaken
its
resolve
in
a
speech
later
on
wednesday
he
said
it
is
vitally
important
that
politicians
in
westminster
understand
the
overwhelming
wish
across
society
in
northern
ireland
not
to
return
to
the
borders
and
division
of
times
anybody
who
allows
that
to
happen
will
be
judged
harshly
by
history
and
rightly
so
this
government
in
dublin
is
not
going
to
allow
it
and
i
want
to
be
crystal
clear
there
are
some
things
that
are
more
important
than
economic
