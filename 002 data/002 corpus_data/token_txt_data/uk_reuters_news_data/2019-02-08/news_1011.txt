independence
party
ukip
launched
a
set
of
populist
policies
on
friday
hoping
to
revive
their
dwindling
political
influence
and
capitalise
on
outrage
over
the
government
s
handling
of
brexit
prime
minister
theresa
may
is
struggling
to
sell
her
plan
for
a
brexit
that
would
continue
to
see
britain
abide
by
many
eu
rules
growing
unrest
among
groups
could
scupper
her
leadership
and
thrust
britain
into
political
crisis
ukip
played
a
defining
role
in
recent
british
history
as
the
force
that
pressured
former
conservative
prime
minister
david
cameron
to
call
a
referendum
on
leaving
the
eu
and
then
stoked
the
uprising
behind
the
leave
vote
but
since
finding
itself
on
the
winning
side
of
the
brexit
vote
ukip
has
struggled
to
influence
the
exit
process
seeing
its
voter
support
evaporate
and
undergoing
two
years
of
inner
turmoil
to
find
a
leader
to
replace
the
talismanic
nigel
farage
on
friday
current
leader
gerard
batten
published
a
manifesto
document
that
sought
to
rediscover
the
everyman
appeal
that
once
made
the
party
a
threat
to
larger
rivals
from
across
the
british
political
spectrum
these
policies
are
aimed
at
helping
the
people
who
form
the
backbone
of
britain
ordinary
workers
and
taxpayers
the
unemployed
who
would
like
to
work
and
small
and
business
owners
batten
a
member
of
the
european
parliament
said
in
a
statement
launching
the
manifesto
its
purpose
is
to
make
ukip
a
populist
party
in
the
real
meaning
of
the
word
one
whose
policies
are
popular
with
the
policies
included
a
complete
and
total
withdrawal
from
the
eu
arguing
that
britain
should
end
all
payments
to
the
eu
and
adherence
to
the
bloc
s
rules
a
much
more
radical
break
than
may
is
proposing
batten
has
been
criticised
including
by
some
former
ukip
members
for
engaging
with
causes
championed
by
groups
and
he
has
described
islam
as
a
death
cult
other
policies
much
of
which
are
similar
to
previous
ukip
positions
include
selective
and
limited
immigration
scrapping
overseas
aid
lower
domestic
taxes
and
a
tougher
approach
to
taxing
multinational
companies
ukip
currently
has
no
elected
representatives
in
parliament
and
it
gathered
only
votes
in
a
general
election
compared
to
million
in
a
fall
from
more
than
percent
of
the
total
vote
to
less
than
percent
nevertheless
in
many
marginal
seats
it
has
the
power
to
influence
which
major
party
can
win
and
with
no
party
clearly
ahead
in
opinion
polls
has
the
potential
to
affect
the
outcome
of
any
future
national
election
although
an
election
is
not
scheduled
until
may
s
government
remains
fragile
