british
organisations
would
need
to
take
action
to
ensure
they
could
continue
to
receive
personal
data
about
their
customers
in
the
european
union
in
the
event
of
the
uk
leaving
the
bloc
without
a
deal
next
year
the
uk
government
said
on
thursday
you
would
need
to
take
action
to
ensure
eu
organisations
were
able
to
continue
to
send
you
personal
data
it
said
in
one
of
a
series
of
technical
notices
published
to
help
businesses
and
the
public
prepare
for
a
brexit
british
companies
with
customers
in
the
european
union
depend
on
a
free
flow
of
personal
information
which
until
now
has
been
possible
because
the
european
union
deems
britain
s
level
of
personal
data
protection
equivalent
to
that
of
the
eu
that
decision
would
need
to
be
reassessed
once
britain
left
the
bloc
