london
reuters
a
brexit
deal
can
be
agreed
in
the
next
weeks
british
finance
minister
philip
hammond
said
on
tuesday
but
there
would
not
be
enough
time
to
have
a
legally
precise
text
on
the
uk
s
future
relationship
with
the
bloc
once
it
leaves
asked
about
comments
from
the
eu
s
chief
brexit
negotiator
michel
barnier
that
a
deal
was
realistic
in
weeks
hammond
told
lawmakers
in
britain
s
upper
house
of
parliament
i
think
it
is
he
added
that
although
the
withdrawal
agreement
would
be
a
legal
text
the
declaration
on
a
future
relationship
could
be
less
detailed
there
s
merit
in
having
quite
a
bit
of
detail
but
clearly
we
don
t
have
enough
time
to
negotiate
the
full
draft
legal
text
in
what
will
be
quite
a
complex
future
partnership
agreement
he
said
