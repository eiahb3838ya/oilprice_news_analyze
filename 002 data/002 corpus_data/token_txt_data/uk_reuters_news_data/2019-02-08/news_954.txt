said
he
was
no
longer
hopeful
about
the
prospects
of
catalonia
gaining
independence
last
year
we
lived
through
one
of
our
best
moments
i
watched
my
parents
cry
with
joy
at
being
able
to
vote
but
now
we
are
stuck
he
said
despite
managing
a
vital
if
narrow
victory
in
regional
elections
last
december
catalan
parties
have
struggled
to
retain
momentum
this
year
with
many
of
their
best
known
leaders
either
in
self
imposed
exile
or
in
detention
awaiting
trial
for
their
role
in
organising
the
referendum
and
subsequent
declaration
of
independence
joan
puig
a

said
the
conflict
had
been
stoked
by
politicians
on
both
sides
it
s
getting
more
and
more
tense
he
said
on
saturday
oriol
junqueras
one
of
nine
catalan
leaders
in
jail
since
late
last
year
announced
he
would
run
in
european
parliament
elections
next
year
standing
as
a
candidate
for
the
european
elections
is
the
best
way
to
denounce
the
regression
in
democratic
values
and
repression
we
have
seen
from
the
spanish
government
