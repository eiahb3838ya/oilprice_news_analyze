day
kim

the

more
than
years
that
follow
said
hong
min
senior
researcher
of
korea
institute
for
national
unification
however
it
won
t
be
easy
for
him
this
weekend
because
he
did
not
really
achieve
anything
after
he
changed
the
national
policy
line
to
economic
sanctions
against
north
korea
over
its
nuclear
weapons
development
have
been
squeezing
the
impoverished
state
where
some
percent
of
the
population
or
more
than
million
people
need
humanitarian
assistance
and
about
percent
of
children
suffer
from
malnutrition
according
to
estimates
under
kim
s
rule
the
country
has
also
been
accused
of
widespread
human
rights
abuses
with
a
report
last
year
estimating
between
and
people
are
held
in
prison
camps
state
media
have
called
for
the
day
to
be
a
celebration
of
the
victor
and
continuously
expand
the
results
of
the
big
economic
development
for
the
first
time
in
five
years
pyongyang
is
organising
mass
games
a
huge
nationalist
pageant
performed
by

one
of
the

largest

one
air
koryo
flight
from
beijing
to
pyongyang
observed
by
reuters
was
fully
booked
mostly
with
foreign
tourists
and
media
the
events
especially
the
photogenic
mass
games
offer
north
korea
a
chance
to
raise
foreign
currency
from
thousands
of
international
visitors
pouring
into
the
capital
at
a
time
when
tourism
remains
one
of
the
few
remaining
reliable
sources
of
income
amid
sanctions
targeting
percent
of
its
billion
annual
exports
while
ticket
prices
for
past
mass
games
topped
out
at
euros
pounds
this
year
vip
seats
cost
euros
said
simon
cockerell
general
manager
for
the
koryo
tours
agency
the
cheapest
seats
are
euros
with
several
other
pricing
brackets
in
between
despite
the
costs
demand
is
strong
he
said
there
s
very
high
interest
cockerell
said
all
the
flights
are
full
all
the
hotels
are
full
it
s
quite
telling
that
chinese
tour
companies
were
banned
by
the
north
korean
side
from
taking
in
any
tourists
until
the
middle
of
september
simply
for
capacity
the
korea
maritime
institute
a
south
korean
estimates
tourism
generates
million
a
year
for
the
isolated
country
with
chinese
tourists
making
up
about
percent
of
foreign
visitors
to
the
north
so
far
only
one
head
of
state
from
mauritania
is
known
to
be
visiting
north
korea
for
the
celebrations
something
north
korea
blames
the
united
states
for
the
is
forcing
other
countries
not
to
send
delegations
to
the
celebrations
of
the
founding
anniversary
of
the
dprk
the
north
s
foreign
ministry
said
in
a
statement
published
by
state
media
kcna
last
month
after
weeks
of
speculation
that
chinese
president
xi
jinping
may
make
his
first
visit
to
pyongyang
on
sunday
beijing
announced
on
tuesday
the
chinese
delegation
would
instead
be
led
by
parliament
chief
li
zhanshu
north
korea
is
also
hosting
a
trade
show
and
other
trips
aimed
at
attracting
foreign
investors
later
in
september
but
many
will
remain
wary
of
sanctions
that
still
block
many
aspects
of
trade
with
the
north
michael
spavor
a
canadian
business
consultant
who
heads
paektu
cultural
exchange
said
he
is
working
with
the
north
korean
government
to
bring
about
chinese
investors
and
entrepreneurs
to
tour
potential
projects
in
pyongyang
wonsan
and
nampho
we
will
attend
matchmaking
sessions
with
various
government
officials
and
stakeholders
as
well
as
visiting
existing
and
future
development
zones
spavor
told
reuters
also
on
the
expected
schedule
for
sunday
is
a
torchlight
procession
as
well
as
a
military
parade
which
will
be
closely
watched
for
signs
of
new
ballistic
missiles
or
other
advanced
weaponry
north
korea
routinely
uses
major
holidays
to
showcase
its
military
capabilities
and
the
latest
developments
in
missile
technology
the
website
north
says
satellite
imagery
suggests
the
military
component
of
sunday
s
parade
could
be
bigger
than
one
held
earlier
this
year
although
no
ballistic
missiles
or
their
launchers
have
been
spotted
display
of
military
prowess
has
always
been
crucial
in
north
korean
statecraft
hong
the
researcher
said
but
north
korea
does
know
that
if
they
do
display
icbms
the
international
society
will
doubt
their
willingness
for
denuclearisation
it
s
highly
unlikely
that
north
korea
would
be
risking
