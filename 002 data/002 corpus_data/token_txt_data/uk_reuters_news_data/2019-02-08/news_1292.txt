war

deep
remorse
on

over
the

vowed

of

abe
sent
a
ritual
offering
to
tokyo
s
controversial
yasukuni

for

visit
out
of
apparent
consideration
for
ties
with
south
korea
and
china
past
visits
by
japanese
leaders
to
the
shrine
have
outraged
china
and
south

honours
japanese
wartime
leaders
convicted
as
war
criminals
by
an
allied
tribunal
along
with
war
dead
china
s
relations
with
japan
have
long
been
haunted
by
what
beijing
sees
as
tokyo
s
failure
to
atone
for
its
occupation
of
parts
of
china
before
and
during
world
war
two
although
ties
have
thawed
recently

and
bitter
memories
rankle
a
akihito
who
will
abdicate
next

spoke
at
the
memorial
for
war
dead
after
a
moment
of
silence
thinking
of
the
peaceful
times
that
have
extended
for
many
years
after
the
war
reflecting
on
our
past
and
with
a
feeling
of
deep
remorse
i
earnestly
hope
that
the
ravages
of
war
will
never
be
repeated
said
akihito
who
was
accompanied
by
a
empress
michiko
akihito
has
carved
out
a
role
as
a
symbol
of
peace
democracy
and
reconciliation
during
his
three
decades
on
the
throne
visiting
wartime
battlefields
to
pray
for
the
dead
of
all
nationalities
his
remarks
on
wednesday
echoed
those
he
first
spoke
on
the
anniversary
of
the
end
of
the
war
which
were
seen
by
many
liberals
and
moderate
conservatives
as
a
subtle
rebuke
to
abe
who
has
said
future
generations
should
not
have
to
keep
apologising
for
the
conflict
i
will
humbly
face
the
