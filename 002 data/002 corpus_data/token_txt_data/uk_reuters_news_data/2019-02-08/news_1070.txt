shares
with
her
husband
in
new
bern
north
carolina
the
macdaniels
are
seeking
shelter
from
the
monster
storm
hurricane
florence
and
they
decided
it
was
best
to
leave
their
little
dogs
behind
they
were
among
north
carolinians
staying
in
shelters
after
being
displaced
by
the
storm
that
is
expected
to
bring
powerful
storm
surges
and
dozens
of
inches
of
rain
to
the
eastern
part
of
the
state
this
has
been
a
really
large
evacuation
and
sheltering
operation
probably
the
largest
we
ve
done
so
that
has
not
been
an
easy
lift
i
think
it
s
working
said
keith
acree
of
north
carolina
s
department
of
emergency
management

carolina
began
feeling
the
effects
of
florence
s
wind
and
heavy
rain
on
thursday
afternoon
but
the
storm
was
not
expected
to
make
landfall
until
late
night
or
early
on
friday
avis
miner
brought
her
friend
and
five
grandchildren
to
a
shelter
in
washington
about
miles
east
of

after
leaving
their
trailer
home
in
aurora
she
worried
that
if
they
stayed
home
we
d
be
blown
in
shelters
on
thursday
people
crowded
on
cots
inflatable
mattresses
and
blankets
on
the
floors
and
in
hallways
of
gymnasiums
clustering
in
corners
to
talk
and
outside
to
smoke
more
than

by
wednesday
afternoon
along
with

nine
cats
and
a
bird

safety
at
another

in
the
city
it
wasn
t
safe

david

a
retired
tow

evacuated
his

debbie
green
director
of
social
services
for
pamlico
county
said
she
is
always
worried
about
people
being
too
isolated
and
vulnerable
to
make
it
to
a
shelter
and
she
said
there
are
always
people
that
are
not
willing
to
still
the
shelter
she
is
overseeing
in
grantsboro
about
miles
east
of
raleigh
was
percent
full
by
noon
on
thursday
and
green
expected
that
number
to
swell
people
will
come
in
the
middle
of
a
storm
she
said
macdaniel
who
has
sat
out
previous
storms
said
everyone
told
her
that
florence
would
be
different
all
the
other
storms
we
stayed
put
but
they
told
us
this
storm
was
the
doozy
macdaniel
said
we
have
never
flooded
before
but
we
didn
t
really
want
to
take
no
now
she
s
counting
the
hours
until
she
can
return
home
to
her
chihuahuas
when
it
clears
up
just
a
little
bit
