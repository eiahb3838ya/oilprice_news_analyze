border blockade: irish riddle defies creative brexit minds
brussels
reuters
brains
sweat
and
toil
over
the
past
week
brought
british
and
eu
civil
servants
to
the
brink
of
a
brexit
deal
at
the
weekend
but
in
the
end
the
painful
history
and
fraught
future
of
a
divided
ireland
defeated
them
eu
sources
familiar
with
events
in
the
european
commission
s
brussels
headquarters
over
the
weekend
told
reuters
more
work
was
needed
on
the
irish
backstop
but
it
is
now
mostly
up
to
political
leaders
to
unravel
a
knot
that
has
defied
the
creativity
of
europe
s
finest
diplomatic
brains
there
is
only
so
much
we
can
do
said
an
eu
diplomat
the
brits
are
not
ready
they
need
more
time
he
added
he
echoed
a
widely
held
view
that
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
needs
more
of
a
sense
of
political
crisis
at
home
in
order
to
persuade
hardline
political
allies
to
give
up
the
last
concessions
needed
for
agreement
teams
led
by
oliver
robbins
may
s
europe
adviser
and
sabine
weyand
german
deputy
to
french
chief
eu
negotiator
michel
barnier
worked
long
hours
often
into
the
night
over
the
past
week
and
were
still
thrashing
over
ways
to
bridge
gaps
late
on
saturday
in
the
hope
of
an
irish
solution
but
by
early
sunday
despite
clearing
out
conflicts
on
other
issues
in
what
diplomats
called
an
atmosphere
of
rising
mutual
appreciation
it
seemed
the
irish
border
was
a
bridge
too
far
london
was
still
loath
to
endorse
even
the
most
modest
insurance
clause
that
might
one
day
treat
northern
ireland
differently
from
the
british
mainland
in
the
interest
of
keeping
the
fragile
province
s
land
border
open
a
key
aspect
of
the
peace
deal
that
ended
decades
of
irish
sectarian
bloodshed
may
s
backstop
solution
remained
keeping
the
whole
of
the
united
kingdom
inside
the
eu
customs
area
longer
than
planned
until
a
new
trade
deal
is
agreed
that
would
ensure
there
is
no
friction
on
the
ireland
border
but
with
a
clause
to
avoid
this
backstop
becoming
permanent
the
europeans
had
scaled
back
demands
on
ireland
as
far
as
they
could
offering
to
extend
the
whole
united
kingdom
s
place
inside
the
eu
customs
area
by
a
year
and
keep
any
checks
on
trade
between
northern
ireland
and
the
mainland
discreet
but
they
could
not
agree
to
sign
a
withdrawal
treaty
that
leaves
the
irish
border
issue
dependent
on
the
uncertain
result
of
future
talks
on
trade
relations
the
british
complained
that
the
eu
wanted
a
backstop
to
the
backstop
and
said
no
addressing
the
british
parliament
on
monday
may
urged
the
eu
not
to
allow
a
over
the
irish
backstop
to
derail
the
brexit
talks
saying
she
believed
a
deal
was
achievable
when
may
s
brexit
secretary
dominic
raab
flew
in
to
meet
barnier
in
late
afternoon
on
sunday
to
formally
convey
britain
s
red
line
on
the
backstop
that
meeting
not
only
did
nothing
to
ease
the
impasse
but
said
eu
sources
seemed
to
reopen
other
issues
that
the
technical
negotiators
thought
were
closed
leaders
of
the
other
eu
states
will
now
meet
over
dinner
in
brussels
on
wednesday
to
discuss
how
to
proceed
they
have
invited
may
to
speak
to
them
ahead
of
their
regular
eu
summit
on
thursday
but
they
will
try
not
to
negotiate
with
her
they
will
take
account
of
a
briefing
from
barnier
to
their
europe
ministers
on
tuesday
in
luxembourg
and
any
new
moves
from
may
who
told
parliament
in
london
on
monday
that
the
irish
backstop
blockage
should
not
derail
brexit
talks
some
notably
including
french
president
emmanuel
macron
want
to
press
britain
and
northern
ireland
s
democratic
unionist
party
dup
which
props
up
may
s
minority
government
to
give
ground
in
part
by
stepping
up
planning
for
a
no
deal
outcome
next
march
widely
seen
as
risking
economic
upheaval
other
leaders
say
diplomats
involved
in
discussions
among
envoys
on
brexit
tactics
warned
after
the
weekend
debacle
to
go
easy
and
not
repeat
the
kind
of
angry
rhetoric
that
followed
their
last
summit
with
may
in
salzburg
last
month
for
now
the
line
for
eu
negotiators
is
in
an
echo
of
a
classic
british
expression
keep
calm
and
carry
on
hoping
that
the
politicians
can
find
a
way
to
get
out
of
their
hole
it
may
take
longer
for
the
panic
around
a
to
sink
in
and
hopefully
soften
the
dup
line
said
an
eu
diplomat
and
there
has
never
been
an
eu
deal
done
before
