president
donald
trump
said
on
thursday
he
will
meet
with
chinese
president
xi
jinping
soon
to
try
to
seal
a
comprehensive
trade
deal
as
trump
and
his
top
trade
negotiator
both
cited
substantial
progress
in
two
days
of
talks
trump
speaking
at
the
white
house
during
a
meeting
with
chinese
vice
premier
liu
he
said
he
was
optimistic
that
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
could
reach
the
biggest
deal
ever
the
chinese
trade
delegation
said
in
a
statement
that
the
talks
made
important
progress
china
s
official
xinhua
news
agency
reported
no
specific
plans
for
a
meeting
with
xi
were
announced
but
trump
said
there
could
be
more
than
one
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
and
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
were
invited
to
bring
a
negotiating
team
to
beijing
around
with
dates
still
pending
the
white
house
also
said
in
a
statement
that
its
scheduled
march
tariff
increase
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
was
a
hard
deadline
if
no
deal
was
reached
by
march
at
the
end
of
the
talks
next
door
to
the
white
house
liu
told
trump
that
china
would
make
a
new
immediate
commitment
to
buy
more
soybeans
an
administration
official
later
clarified
the
amount
as
a
total
of
million
tonnes
effectively
doubling
the
amount
bought
by
china
since
resuming
limited
purchases
in
december
soybean
sales
to
china
which
totalled
million
tonnes
in
were
largely
cut
off
in
the
second
half
of
last
year
by
china
s
retaliatory
tariffs
and
the
announcement
drew
a
positive
reaction
from
trump
who
said
it
would
make
our
farmers
very
the
chinese
delegation
said
china
will
expand
imports
of
agricultural
energy
service
and
industrial
products
according
to
xinhua
while
china
has
previously
offered
increased
purchases
of
farm
energy
and
other
goods
to
try
to
resolve
the
trade
disputes
negotiators
also
dug
into
thornier
issues
including
demands
that
china
take
steps
to
protect
american
intellectual
property
and
end
policies
that
washington
says
force
companies
to
turn
over
technology
to
chinese
firms
lighthizer
said
there
was
substantial
progress
on
these
issues
including
verification
mechanisms
to
enforce
china
s
on
any
reform
commitments
it
makes
at
this
point
it
s
impossible
for
me
to
predict
success
but
we
re
in
a
place
that
if
things
work
out
it
could
happen
lighthizer
said
at
the
oval
office
meeting
later
he
told
reporters
that
the
objective
was
to
make
china
s
commitments
more
specific
and
enforceable
with
a
mechanism
for
taking
action
if
china
fails
to
follow
through
but
declined
to
provide
details
reuters
previously
reported
that
such
an
enforcement
mechanism
could
carry
the
threat
of
tariffs
asked
whether
the
two
sides
discussed
lifting
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
lighthizer
said
they
were
not
part
of
the
talks
the
two
sides
established
a
consensus
in
principle
for
an
implementation
mechanism
framework
xinhua
said
adding
without
elaborating
that
the
united
states
had
agreed
to
earnestly
respond
to
china
s
concerns
chinese
foreign
ministry
spokesman
geng
shuang
declined
during
a
regular
news
briefing
in
beijing
to
give
any
details
on
a
possible
meeting
a
person
familiar
with
the
discussions
said
a
broad
range
of
concerns
about
access
to
chinese
agricultural
markets
were
raised
in
the
talks
but
little
progress
was
made
washington
has
warned
it
will
more
than
double
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
to
percent
from
percent
if
significant
headway
on
a
trade
deal
was
not
made
by
march
trump
said
he
did
not
think
he
would
need
to
extend
the
deadline
i
think
when
president
xi
and
i
meet
every
point
will
be
agreed
to
trump
added
but
trump
has
vetoed
multiple
proposed
trade
deals
with
china
choosing
to
push
ahead
with
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
to
gain
leverage
analysts
mostly
remain
deeply
sceptical
that
a
genuine
trade
deal
can
be
done
on
this
time
frame
economists
from
commonwealth
bank
of
australia
said
in
a
note
we
are
less
pessimistic
since
these
negotiations
are
being
conducted
by
senior
politicians
not
by
trade
bureaucrats
they
added
both
sides
also
have
an
incentive
and
arguably
a
growing
incentive
to
get
a
meaningful
deal
earlier
trump
said
on
twitter
he
was
looking
for
china
to
open
its
markets
not
only
to
financial
services
which
they
are
now
doing
but
also
to
our
manufacturing
farmers
and
other
businesses
and
industries
without
this
a
deal
would
be
unacceptable
the
complaints
on
technology
transfers
and
intellectual
property
protections
along
with
accusations
of
chinese
cyber
theft
of
american
trade
secrets
and
a
systematic
campaign
to
acquire
technology
firms
were
used
by
trump
s
administration
to
justify
punitive
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
china
has
retaliated
with
tariffs
of
its
own
but
has
suspended
some
and
is
allowing
some
purchases
of
soybeans
during
the
talks
chinese
officials
have
said
their
policies
do
not
coerce
technology
transfers
the
chinese
delegation
said
china
will
actively
respond
to
concerns
on
intellectual
property
and
creating
a
fair
market
environment
xinhua
reported
the
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
are
just
one
front
in
trump
s
efforts
to
upend
the
global
trading
order
with
his
america
first
strategy
he
has
also
imposed
global
tariffs
on
imported
steel
and
aluminium
washing
machines
and
solar
panels
and
has
threatened
to
raise
tariffs
on
imported
cars
unless
japan
and
the
european
union
offer
trade
concessions
