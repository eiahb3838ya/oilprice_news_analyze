farnborough

japan
s
mitsubishi
aircraft
corp
trying
to
keep
its
new
regional
jet
on
track
after
series
of
delays
was
forced
to
cancel
a
demo
flight
for
the
world
s
aerospace
industry
on
tuesday
after
the
jet
was
hit
by
a
truck
the
prang
which
follows
the
jet
s
debut
at
the
show
on
monday
will
not
interrupt
marketing
efforts
but
it
will
do
nothing
to
help
the
mitsubishi
regional
jet
mrj
pull
in
orders
at
a
time
when
giants
airbus
se
and
boeing
co
are
extending
their
grip
to
the
smaller
end
of
the
market
the
mrj
japan
s
great
hope
for
reviving
a
dormant
commercial
aviation
industry
was
launched
a
decade
ago
five
delays
later
it
is
now
expected
to
enter
service
with
japanese
carrier
ana
holdings
inc
in
compared
with
the
initial
target
of
as
a
result
it
missed
a
potentially
lucrative
window
of
opportunity
to
be
the
first
to
market
with
the
latest
generation
of
regional
jets
it
is
now
up
against
the
already
airbus
the
newly
rebranded
former
bombardier
inc
cseries
and
the
embraer
series
which
may
be
controlled
by
boeing
if
a
provisional
deal
between
the
manufacturers
is
completed
these
developments
are
disastrous
for
the
mrj
said
richard
aboulafia
vice
president
analysis
at
teal
group
they
are
no
longer
competing
with
small
companies
from
canada
and
brazil
they
are
now
competing
with
global
aerospace
behemoths
with
enormous
pricing
power
and
industrial
mitsubishi
aircraft
is
looking
to
gain
orders
despite
the
increased
competitive
threat
and
executives
at
farnborough
hosting
a
press
conference
as
the
rival
flew
overhead
said
they
felt
they
had
a
good
chance
in
the
regional
market
this
is
the
newest
plane
design
in
several
decades
shunichi
miyanaga
president
and
ceo
of
parent
mitsubishi
heavy
industries
ltd
said
and
aerodynamically
it
is
the
newest
type
of
regional
jet
and
is
highly
it
will
not
compete
with
the
larger
variants
of
the
embraer
and
planes
with
miyanaga
saying
that
it
wanted
to
focus
on
the
and
under
segment
of
the
market
however
analysts
say
the
more
immediate
challenge
is
hanging
onto
its
existing
order
book
given
mitsubishi
aircraft
has
so
far
lost
its
bet
on
pilot
unions
relaxing
strict
rules
about
the
size
of
jets
flown
by
regional
carriers
of
the
firm
orders
are
split
between
two
regional
carriers
skywest
inc
and
trans
states
holdings
the
is
too
large
for
them
to
fly
without
the
relaxation
of
the
pilot
union
rules
and
the
prospect
of
changes
has
dimmed
due
to
a
pilot
shortage
that
has
given
unions
more
bargaining
power
as
a
result
mitsubishi
aircraft
is
now
trying
to
bring
the
smaller
which
can
be
flown
by
regional
pilots
into
service
as
quickly
as
possible
with
late
the
target
date
flightglobal
s
flight
fleet
forecast
released
last
week
estimated
the
regional
jet
market
as
worth
billion
over
the
next
years
with
percent
of
the
value
coming
from
seaters
serving
the
north
american
market
however
mrj
has
yet
to
convince
its
key
customers
to
switch
to
its
smaller
jet
which
has
its
own
challenges
the
has
seats
rather
than
the
of
the
rival
bombardier
and
embraer
when
configured
with
business
and
economy
class
as
is
typical
in
the
united
states
meaning
its
fuel
efficiency
is
less
of
an
advantage
than
it
might
seem
downsized
variants
of
jetliner
families
have
inferior
economics
fewer
seats
but
the
same
engines
systems
and
most
of
the
structures
too
teal
group
s
aboulafia
said
embraer
on
monday
signed
a
firm
order
with
united
airlines
for
jets
shortly
after
jetblue
airways
corp
opted
to
replace
its
fleet
of
embraer
jets
with
the
skywest
and
trans
states
did
not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for
comment
on
whether
they
plan
to
switch
to
the
for
the
japanese
consortium
behind
the
mrj
led
by
mitsubishi
heavy
with
a
percent
stake
the
project
has
so
far
been
a
financial
disappointment
due
to
the
delays
and
technical
challenges
nikkei
last
week
reported
mitsubishi
aircraft
was
looking
to
increase
its
capital
through
a
combination
of
a
swap
and
raising
fresh
equity
japan
inc
s
ultimate
goal
for
the
programme
however
goes
beyond
profit
it
is
about
serving
as
a
foundation
for
the
revival
of
japan
as
a
passenger
jet
manufacturer
rather
than
just
a
major
supplier
to
companies
like
boeing
we
are
working
without
pause
to
deliver
the
first
aircraft
to
ana
in
it
is
the
beginning
of
a
countdown
not
only
to
the
first
delivery
but
to
a
new
era
for
the
industry
