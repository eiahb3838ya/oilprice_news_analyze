hamburg
reuters
germany
s
christian
democrats
have
played
it
safe
by
opting
for
annegret
to
succeed
chancellor
angela
merkel
as
party
leader
they
have
voted
for
a
centrist
who
is
long
on
party
unity
and
short
on
major
policy
initiatives
merkel
s
decision
to
stand
down
as
leader
of
her
christian
democratic
union
cdu
is
part
of
her
slow
exit
from
german
politics
and
in
the
party
has
chosen
a
successor
from
the
same
mould
dubbed
merkel
by
opposition
parties
was
the
continuity
candidate
in
the
leadership
campaign
less
bold
in
her
policy
proposals
than
rival
friedrich
merz
the
cdu
has
opted
for
centrist
continuity
and
it
let
merkel
have
her
way
one
more
time
said
carsten
nickel
managing
director
at
political
consultancy
teneo
today
s
close
result
shows
the
party
is
as
split
as
german
after
her
narrow
victory
by
votes
to
over
merz
s
first
priority
is
to
unite
the
cdu
after
a
series
of
electoral
setbacks
that
threaten
its
role
as
germany
s
leading
volkspartei
or
big
popular
party
in
a
short
speech
to
accept
the
party
leadership
she
called
for
all
the
factions
all
members
everyone
who
carries
responsibility
to
move
forward
with
the
goal
that
we
share
to
remain
the
big
volkspartei
of
the
her
first
act
as
leader
was
to
invite
her
two
rivals
to
take
the
congress
stage
with
her
in
a
show
of
party
unity
has
little
time
to
waste
an
election
in
bremen
next
may
is
the
first
of
four
regional
votes
next
year
in
october
the
cdu
lost
over
percentage
points
in
another
state
election
in
hesse
merkel
announced
she
would
stand
down
as
party
leader
after
that
damaging
result
after
a
robust
campaign
for
the
cdu
leadership
must
now
try
to
engineer
a
rebound
in
next
year
s
state
votes
a
tough
task
that
will
soak
up
her
time
and
energy
and
leave
her
little
bandwidth
for
fresh
policy
initiatives
teneo
s
nickel
said
the
close
leadership
result
means
continuity
in
europe
beyond
merkel
s
personal
leadership
in
the
council
don
t
expect
bold
initiatives
from
berlin
the
cdu
will
continue
to
be
busy
with
is
not
prone
to
bold
policy
moves
anyway
during
the
leadership
campaign
she
took
more
a
cautious
stance
on
the
future
of
europe
than
merz
who
said
germany
should
contribute
more
to
the
european
union
as
it
benefits
from
a
euro
that
is
too
weak
for
our
economy
last
month
told
a
business
conference
with
every
wish
to
take
europe
forward
with
a
nucleus
the
proposals
must
always
fit
with
german
she
said
europe
must
move
towards
a
banking
union
but
first
the
risks
must
be
minimised
so
that
it
is
acceptable
in
german
interests
as
her
great
strength
is
her
record
as
former
state
premier
in
saarland
where
she
led
an
experimental
broad
coalition
with
the
greens
and
free
democrats
skills
useful
in
germany
s
fractured
political
landscape
that
ability
to
build
bridges
clinched
her
the
cdu
top
job
there
is
a
feeling
that
we
are
strengthened
delegate
stephan
toscani
said
after
friday
s
leadership
vote
there
is
a
willingness
to
pull
together
now
i
am
sure
that
merkel
will
remain
chancellor
right
through
her
merkel
plans
to
stay
on
as
chancellor
until
the
next
federal
election
due
by
october
the
cdu
s
election
of
makes
that
scenario
more
likely
with
merz
an
old
rival
would
have
proven
harder
for
merkel
the
risk
for
is
that
opposition
parties
seize
on
her
similarities
to
merkel
whose
authority
has
waned
since
her
divisive
decision
in
to
keep
german
borders
open
to
refugees
fleeing
war
in
the
middle
east
is
a
continuation
of
merkel
with
other
means
said
alexander
gauland
of
the
alternative
for
germany
which
surged
into
the
bundestag
for
the
first
time
last
year
on
a
wave
of
discontent
with
merkel
she
supported
the
refugee
policy
and
will
