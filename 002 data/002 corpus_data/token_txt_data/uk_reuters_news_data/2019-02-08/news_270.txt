london
reuters
the
northern
irish
party
that
props
up
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
government
said
on
friday
that
it
would
not
support
her
brexit
deal
but
that
businesses
should
be
relaxed
about
leaving
the
eu
without
an
agreement
in
fact
we
re
more
alarmed
about
what
is
coming
out
from
the
eu
and
especially
the
irish
government
the
democratic
unionist
party
s
sammy
wilson
said
when
asked
if
he
was
reassured
by
signals
from
brussels
may
still
hopes
to
get
her
deal
through
parliament
though
even
members
of
her
own
cabinet
admit
privately
that
to
do
so
she
will
need
to
make
significant
changes
and
win
over
lots
of
opposition
lawmakers
if
the
lower
house
of
the
british
parliament
does
not
approve
may
s
deal
then
the
world
s
economy
will
leave
the
eu
without
one
on
march
at
gmt
as
the
date
is
set
in
law
the
withdrawal
act
the
northern
irish
dup
whose
lawmakers
have
propped
up
may
s
minority
government
has
demanded
she
ditch
the
irish
backstop
something
the
eu
and
may
have
ruled
out
the
dup
s
wilson
told
bbc
radio
that
the
irish
backstop
was
a
con
trick
and
added
that
farmers
and
businesses
should
be
totally
relaxed
about
a
brexit
if
anyone
should
be
worried
about
the
tariffs
on
beef
and
sheep
then
it
should
be
the
irish
because
of
course
we
the
united
kingdom
are
net
importers
of
food
wilson
said
facing
the
defeat
of
her
deal
last
month
may
postponed
a
parliamentary
vote
on
it
pledging
to
seek
legal
and
political
assurances
from
the
eu
those
efforts
appear
so
far
to
be
in
vain
the
eu
said
it
will
not
reopen
the
negotiation
though
it
signalled
it
might
offer
some
concessions
may
needs
votes
to
get
a
deal
through
parliament
yet
of
her
lawmakers
voted
against
her
in
a
confidence
vote
on
so
she
will
need
the
support
of
some
of
the
labour
party
s
lawmakers
or
to
win
over
swathes
of
her
own
party
and
the
dup
