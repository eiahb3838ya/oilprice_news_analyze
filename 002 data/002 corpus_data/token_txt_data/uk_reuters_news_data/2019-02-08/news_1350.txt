reuters
canada
on
monday
refused
to
back
down
in
its
defense
of
human
rights
after
saudi
arabia
froze
new
trade
and
investment
and
expelled
the
canadian
ambassador
in
retaliation
for
ottawa
s
call
to
free
arrested
saudi
civil
society
activists
in
her
first
public
response
to
saudi
arabia
s
actions
foreign
minister
chrystia
freeland
said
canada
will
always
stand
up
for
human
rights
in
canada
and
around
the
world
and
women
s
rights
are
human
riyadh
on
sunday
recalled
its
ambassador
from
canada
and
gave
the
canadian
ambassador
hours
to
leave
the
saudi
government
also
banned
new
trade
with
canada
although
it
was
unclear
if
it
would
affect
existing
annual
trade
of
nearly
billion
and
a
billion
defense
contract
the
moves
were
a
stern
rebuke
to
canada
after
the
country
on
friday
expressed
concern
over
the
arrests
of
activists
in
saudi
arabia
including
prominent
women
s
rights
campaigner
samar
badawi
and
called
for
their
release
riyadh
said
that
amounted
to
a
blatant
interference
in
the
kingdom
s
domestic
affairs
against
basic
international
norms
and
all
international
saudi
arabia
s
sudden
sharp
response
to
criticism
shows
the
limits
of
reforms
by
saudi
arabia
s
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
who
runs
its
government
he
has
launched
a
campaign
of
social
and
economic
change
but
has
not
eased
the
absolute
monarchy
s
total
ban
on
political
activism
in
recent
months
saudi
arabia
has
lifted
a
ban
on
women
driving
but
it
has
also
arrested
activists
including
more
than
a
dozen
campaigners
for
women
s
rights
in
the
fist
comments
by
washington
since
the
dispute
erupted
a
state
department
official
said
the
united
states
had
asked
riyadh
for
details
on
the
detention
of
activists
we
continue
to
encourage
the
government
of
saudi
arabia
to
respect
due
process
and
to
publicize
information
on
the
status
of
legal
cases
the
official
added
on
monday
saudi
foreign
minister
adel
criticized
canada
s
calls
to
free
arrested
civil
society
activists
as
a
position
built
on
misleading
information
the
moves
carried
on
the
official
saudi
press
agency
caught
diplomats
in
riyadh
off
guard
both
the
saudi
and
canadian
ambassadors
were
away
on
leave
at
the
time
the
kingdom
will
suspend
educational
exchange
programs
with
canada
and
move
saudi
scholarship
recipients
to
other
countries
al
arabiya
reported
on
monday
it
would
be
a
shame
for
those
students
if
they
are
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
study
here
freeland
told
reporters
neighbors
and
allies
bahrain
and
the
united
arab
emirates
said
they
stood
with
riyadh
although
they
did
not
announce
similar
measures

said
it

a

of
the

the

but
qatar
which
has
been
locked
in
a
diplomatic
rift
with
saudi
arabia
and
other
neighbors
for
over
a
year
said
on
its
foreign
ministry
s
official
twitter
account
that
the
gcc
secretary
general
s
statement
did
not
represent
its
view
of
the
situation
crown

as
heir
to
the
throne
is
in
line
to
become
the
first
saudi
king
from
a
new
generation
after
a
succession
of
six
brothers
dating
to
he
has
ambitions
to
diversify
the
economy
from
oil
exports
and
ease
some
social
restrictions
but
his
reforms
include
no
changes
that
would
liberalize
a
political
system
that
allows
no
public
dissent
amnesty
international
said
the
response
to
canada
showed
that
it
was
important
western
countries
not
be
intimidated
into
silence
over
riyadh
s
treatment
of
dissenters
instead
of
pursuing
human
rights
reform
the
government
of
saudi
arabia
has
chosen
to
lash
out
with
punitive
measures
in
the
face
of
criticism
said
samah

s
middle

director
of
campaigns
riyadh
has
a
record
of
responding
robustly
to
western
criticism
under
mohammed
bin
salman
saudi
arabia
is
shooting
itself
in
the
foot
if
you
want
to
open
up
your
country
to
the
world
you
don
t
start
expelling
ambassadors
and
freezing
trade
with
countries
such
as
canada
said
