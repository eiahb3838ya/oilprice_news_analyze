hammond to turn up heat on brexit rebels in budget speech
london
reuters
british
finance
minister
philip
hammond
will
use
his
annual
budget
speech
on
monday
to
urge
his
divided
conservative
party
to
get
behind
the
government
s
push
for
a
brexit
deal
or
put
at
risk
a
easing
of
austerity
hammond
who
routinely
angers
many
conservative
lawmakers
by
calling
for
close
ties
with
the
european
union
after
brexit
will
offer
a
glimpse
of
higher
spending
after
nearly
a
decade
of
cuts
to
many
public
services
but
he
will
also
say
that
an
easing
of
the
spending
squeeze
will
hinge
on
london
reaching
an
agreement
with
brussels
to
smooth
britain
s
exit
from
the
eu
in
five
months
time
if
we
don
t
get
a
deal
we
would
need
to
take
a
different
approach
to
the
future
of
britain
s
economy
hammond
told
sky
news
television
on
sunday
we
would
need
to
look
at
a
different
strategy
and
frankly
we
d
need
to
have
a
new
budget
that
set
out
a
different
strategy
for
the
prime
minister
theresa
may
has
so
far
failed
to
rally
the
conservatives
behind
her
brexit
strategy
raising
concerns
that
britain
could
leave
the
eu
in
march
without
a
transition
deal
hammond
could
soften
an
immediate
shock
to
the
economy
by
spending
some
of
the
reserves
he
has
built
up
within
the
limits
of
his
fiscal
rules
but
a
brexit
would
probably
cut
britain
s
annual
growth
rate
to
just
percent
next
year
and
in
and
push
up
borrowing
the
national
institute
of
economic
and
social
research
a
think
tank
said
last
week
britain
s
economy
has
slowed
since
the
brexit
referendum
but
not
as
much
as
many
economists
feared
allowing
hammond
to
announce
on
monday
a
further
improvement
in
the
budget
deficit
still
britain
s
debt
levels
remain
high
limiting
how
much
hammond
can
relax
his
spending
squeeze
he
said
on
sunday
that
the
biggest
increase
in
spending
in
his
budget
had
already
been
announced
when
may
said
four
months
ago
that
more
money
would
go
to
the
health
service
he
is
set
to
announce
other
measures
including
more
spending
on
roads
a
tax
cut
for
small
retailers
hammered
by
online
competition
and
more
spending
on
broadband
hammond
hinted
on
sunday
that
he
would
soften
the
impact
of
changes
to
the
welfare
system
and
said
he
wanted
a
timetable
for
progress
on
getting
giant
tech
firms
to
pay
more
tax
for
now
however
he
is
expected
to
shy
away
from
talking
about
a
broader
push
for
higher
taxes
that
fiscal
experts
say
britain
will
need
in
order
to
meet
the
costs
of
an
ageing
population
last
year
hammond
was
forced
into
a
on
his
plan
to
raise
more
tax
from
people
after
an
uproar
within
the
conservative
party
which
has
since
have
lost
its
majority
in
parliament
