foreigners
net
holdings
of
british
government
debt
fell
by
a
record
amount
last
month
a
move
partly
driven
by
a
large
volume
of
maturing
bonds
but
one
which
also
revived
concerns
about
the
effect
of
brexit
on
investor
appetite
bank

england
data
released
on
thursday
showed
a
net
billion
pound
drop
in
foreigners
holdings
in
july
the
largest
since
records
began
in
and
up
sharply
from
net
sales
of
billion
pounds
in
june
the
fall
in
holdings
can
represent
both
outright
sales
and
investors
deciding
not
to
immediately
reinvest
the
proceeds
of
gilts
that
mature
and
some
analysts
played
down
the
move
i
think
we
have
to
take
those
data
with
a
pinch
of
salt
said
vatsala
datta
a
fixed
income
strategist
at
royal
bank
of
canada
a
primary
dealer
in
british
government
debt
in
months
with
big
redemptions
we
typically
see
that
kind
of
flow
and
it
reverses
in
the
following
month
she
said
adding
that
gilt
prices
had
been
steady
through
july
some
billion
pounds
worth
of
gilts
matured
last
month
and
issuance
totalled
billion
pounds
giving
net
redemptions
of
billion
pounds
for
the
gilt
market
overall
the
highest
for
any
month
since
september
that
said
other
months
with
heavy
net
redemptions
such
as
in
march
when
maturities
outstripped
new
issuance
by
billion
pounds

see
huge
falls
in

july

have
reflected
