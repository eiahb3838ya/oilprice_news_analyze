in
less
than
a
month
juan
guaido
has
gone
from
a
virtual
unknown
in
venezuelan
politics
to
the
country
s
figure
assuming
the
presidency
of
the
congress
and
briefly
being
detained
by
the
secret
police
on
wednesday
the
skinny
from
the
south
american
country
s
hardscrabble
caribbean
coast
thrust
himself
onto
the
international
stage
with
the
boldest
challenge
to
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
s
rule
in
years
he
declared
himself
interim
president
a
move
swiftly
recognised
by
the
united
states
canada
and
many
latin
american
countries
his
rapid
ascent
has
raised
hopes
that
he
could
fill
a
leadership
vacuum
in
venezuela
s
notoriously
divided
opposition
which
has
failed
in
several
attempts
to
oust
maduro
and
his
predecessor
hugo
chavez
many
of
its
most
prominent
figures
have
been
jailed
exiled
or
barred
from
seeking
public
office
the
baseball
fan
has
animated
the
opposition
s
base
and
won
over
many
venezuelans
fed
up
with
the
country
s
hyperinflationary
economic
collapse
who
have
taken
to
the
streets
demanding
maduro
step
down
yet
guaido
still
needs
the
backing
of
the
armed
forces
to
achieve
his
goal
of
forcing
new
elections
today
in
venezuela
we
are
living
under
a
dictatorship
and
we
need
to
put
on
enough
pressure
to
take
control

hide
