berlin
reuters
germany
will
back
an
agreement
on
sunday
on
britain
s
withdrawal
from
the
european
union
and
hopes
spain
s
objection
to
wording
over
the
disputed
british
territory
of
gibraltar
can
be
resolved
by
then
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
spanish
prime
minister
pedro
sanchez
said
on
tuesday
his
government
would
vote
against
the
eu
s
draft
brexit
agreement
if
the
included
text
on
gibraltar
was
not
changed
gibraltar
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
along
with
the
united
kingdom
in
march
although
percent
of
its
population
voted
in
the
referendum
to
remain
in
the
bloc
we
know
how
difficult
the
discussions
are
in
britain
but
i
can
say
for
germany
that
we
will
agree
to
this
exit
agreement
merkel
told
german
lawmakers
on
wednesday
during
a
budget
debate
we
still
have
an
objection
in
spain
i
can
t
say
exactly
how
we
solve
this
issue
but
i
hope
it
will
be
solved
by
the
eu
is
due
to
hold
a
summit
to
discuss
britain
s
draft
brexit
deal
on
that
day
merkel
said
her
government
regretted
but
respected
britain
s
decision
to
leave
adding
we
want
and
that
is
in
our
fundamental
interests
to
have
a
good
relationship
with
britain
in
the
future
on
the
irish
backstop
an
insurance
policy
to
avoid
a
return
to
controls
between
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
and
eu
state
ireland
she
said
this
presented
a
situation
that
was
very
very
difficult
to
i
think
rightly
we
have
placed
value
on
britain
not
being
able
to
decide
unilaterally
when
it
ends
the
customs
union
but
rather
that
britain
together
with
the
eu
defines
this
date
and
afterwards
the
future
relationship
comes
into
effect
