china
and
south
korea
called
for
concessions
from
the
united
states
as
well
as
north
korea
ahead
of
a
possible
second
summit
between
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
and
president
donald
trump
suggesting
a
pressure
campaign
aimed
at
the
north
s
denuclearisation
may
be
slipping
south
korean
president
moon
said
on
thursday
that
he
would
cooperate
with
the
international
community
to
at
least
partially
ease
sanctions
to
allow
for
some
business
and
tourism
ventures
while
later
noting
that
pyongyang
needed
to
take
bold
steps
towards
denuclearisation
to
win
concessions
from
washington
i
think
north
korea
knows
that
they
clearly
have
to
denuclearise
for
the
easing
of
international
sanctions
and
the
also
understands
that
there
needs
to
be
corresponding
action
to
expedite
the
north
s
denuclearisation
moon
told
reporters
at
the
presidential
blue
house
chinese
president
xi
jinping
hosted
kim
in
beijing
this
week
and
said
he
hoped
the
united
states
and
north
korea
would
meet
each
other
halfway
chinese
state
media
reported
china
the
north
s
lone
major
ally
and
south
korea
have
been
key
players
in
two
years
of
maximum
pressure
led
by
the
united
states
but
both
countries
are
signalling
an
increased
willingness
to
ease
sanctions
and
improve
ties
with
north
korea
pyongyang
and
washington
have
been
struggling
to
find
a
breakthrough
despite
a
pledge
by
kim
at
a
landmark
summit
with
trump
in
singapore
in
june
to
work
towards
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
north
korea
which
has
been
developing
nuclear
and
missile
programmes
in
defiance
of
security
council
resolutions
has
demanded
washington
lift
sanctions
and
declare
an
official
end
to
the
korean
war
those
demands
were
in
response
to
pyongyang
s
initial
unilateral
steps
towards
denuclearisation
that
included
dismantling
its
only
known
nuclear
testing
site
and
a
key
missile
engine
facility
north
korea
has
rejected
calls
for
unilateral
disarmament
and
has
said
it
is
now
up
to
the
united
states
and
the
international
community
to
make
concessions
like
easing
sanctions
for
its
part
the
united
states
has
instead
increased
sanctions
and
said
it
will
not
lift
the
measures
until
north
korea
takes
more
steps
towards
giving
up
its
arsenal
of
nuclear
weapons
and
missiles
in
prepared
remarks
for
his
annual
new
year
speech
moon
made
no
mention
of
any
steps
north
korea
needs
to
take
instead
focussing
on
the
economic
benefits
of
making
peace
with
north
korea
but
when
pressed
by
journalists
at
a
briefing
afterward
moon
said
north
korea
should
take
more
steps
such
as
abandoning
its
missiles
and
dismantling
weapons
production
lines
and
other
nuclear
complexes
to
secure
concessions
such
as
sanctions
relief
he
said
reducing
military
commitments
such
as
a
withdrawal
of
troops
or
strategic
assets
from
the
region
would
be
an
unlikely
option
for
washington
north
korea
used
the
reference
to
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
in
the
past
to
include
the
removal
of
the
nuclear
umbrella
in
the
region
the
second
summit
would
be
a
venue
where
they
settle
on
terms
of
what
specific
measures
north
korea
will
take
and
how
those
moves
will
be
reciprocated
by
the
united
states
moon
said
but
forces
in
south
korea
or
strategic
assets
in
places
like
guam
and
japan
are
not
linked
with
north
korea
alone
as
they
exist
for
the
stability
and
peace
of
the
entire
northeast
kim
renewed
his
resolve
to
meet
trump
again
during
his

week
moon
said
kim
s
latest
trip
to
beijing
signalled
that
a
second
trump
summit
was
imminent
another
korea
summit
would
also
expedite
an
unprecedented
visit
by
kim
to
seoul
planned
for
last
year
but
delayed
amid
the
nuclear
standoff
moon
said
i
expect
we
ll
hear
about
talks
between

the

before
long
for
their
second
summit

kcna
said
on
thursday
kim
and
xi
held
frank
discussions
on
the
korean

and
nuclear
issues
during
kim

his
fourth
since

told

about
the
difficulties
and
concerns
in
improving
north

and
denuclearisation
negotiations
kcna
said
xi
agreed
that
north
korea
s
reasonable
concerns
must
be
addressed
properly
it
said
kcna
reported
that
xi
once
again
accepted
kim
s
invitation
to
visit
pyongyang
but
chinese
officials
would
not
provide
further
details
china
s
official
xinhua
news
agency
also
said
pyongyang
s
legitimate
concerns
must
be
taken
seriously
in
order
to
achieve
a
comprehensive
resolution
xinhua
quoted
xi
as
saying
he
hoped
that
north
korea
and
the
united
states
could
meet
each
other
half
way
and
that
the
international
community
expected
peaceful
negotiations
the
political
settlement
of
the
peninsula
issue
faces
a
rare
historic
opportunity
said
xi
who
spoke
highly
of
the
positive
measures
taken
by
the
north
korea
side
to
maintain
peace
and
stability
and
promote
the
realization
of
denuclearisation
on
the
kim
reiterated
a
pledge
from
his
new
year
s
speech
that
the
north
would
try
to
make
a
second
summit
achieve
a
result
that
the
international
community
would
welcome
xinhua
said
wang
yiwei
a
senior
research
fellow
at
the
center
for
china
and
globalization
said
he
believed
north
korea
was
becoming
impatient
and
beginning
to
lose
hope
with
the
united
states
for
asking
it
to
make
changes
without
in
turn
removing
sanctions
the
crux
is
how
to
let
north
korea
denuclearise
and
to
give
it
security
guarantees
on
this
the
united
states
and
north
korea
don
t
have
trust
so
china
has
to
act
as
a
bridge
