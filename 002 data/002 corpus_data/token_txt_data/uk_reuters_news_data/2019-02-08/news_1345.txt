acknowledged
maintaining
a
flat
in
london
for
the
affair
inflating
expense
reports
and
a
long
list
of
other
misdeeds
in
essence
i
was
living
beyond
my
means
the
married
father
of
four
said
from
the
witness
stand
in
alexandria
virginia
i
m
taking
responsibility
for
it
i
made
a
gates
who
is
cooperating
with
special
counsel
robert
mueller
s
investigation
into
russian
meddling
in
the
election
testified
on
monday
that
he
helped
manafort
doctor
financial
statements
hide
foreign
income
and
evade
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
income
taxes
under
questioning
by
defence
attorney
kevin
downing
on
tuesday
gates
also
admitted
he
wrote
a
fraudulent
letter
to
prospective
investors
in
a
movie
project
and
that
it
s
possible
he
submitted
to
trump
s
inaugural
committee
personal
expenses
which
may
have
been
improper
downing
sought
to
portray
gates
as
an
inveterate
liar
raising
questions
about
whether
he
has
been
truthful
with
mueller
s
office
even
after
cutting
a
plea
deal
in
february
under
the
deal
he
admitted
to
helping
manafort
evade
taxes
violate
lobbying
laws
and
conceal
foreign
bank
accounts
in
addition
he
pleaded
guilty
to
making
false

to

the
lies
you
told
you
expect

to
believe
you
downing
asked
gates
who
responded
that
he
did
i
m
here
to
tell
the
truth
gates
shot
back
mr

path
i
m
undercutting

credibility
is
the
foundation
of
manafort

defence
manafort
has
pleaded
not
guilty
to
counts
of
bank
fraud
tax
fraud
and
failing
to
disclose
foreign
bank
accounts
containing
tens
of
millions
of
dollars

the
charges
largely
predate
the
five
months
manafort
spent
on
trump
s
campaign
if
convicted
on
all
counts
manafort
could
face
eight
to
years

numerous
damaging
admissions

to
stealing
from
manafort
but
he
said
he
did
not
know
how
much
money
he
took
looking
at
a
ledger
listing
nearly
million
in
transactions
he
was
unable
to
say
which
ones
were
legitimate
and
which
ones
he
initiated
with
false
expense
reports
downing
also
pressed
gates
about
creating
fake
and
phony
invoices
to
trigger
payments
to
himself
from

vincent
and
the
grenadines
are
they
payments

part
of
a
quid
pro

calk
and
federal
did
not
reply
to
requests
for
comment
gate
s
testimony
was
part
of
the
prosecution

effort
to
prove
that
manafort
was
responsible
for
financial
maneuverings
that
he
and
other
witnesses
have
testified
include
filing
false
tax
returns
defrauding
banks
in
borrowing
against
real
estate
and
failing
to

foreign
bank
accounts

part
of
his

led
to
laughter
in
the
courtroom
not
happy
i
just
saw
this
wtf
manafort
wrote
to
gates
in
an
email
using
a
common
shorthand
to
show
exasperation

that
he
helped
fabricate
documents
to
convert
some
income
to
a
loan

acknowledged
creating
a
fraudulent

manafort
hid
income
earned
for
political
work

in
cyprus
so
they
could
easily
be
paid
by
ukranian
businessman
who
held
bank
accounts
there
prosecutors
showed
contracts
laying
out
that
manafort
would
be
paid
million
a
year
in
quarterly
installments
of
million
all
channelled
through
cyprus
the

were
logged

loans
in
order
to
meet
later
audits
in
cyprus
that
required
documentation
of
transfers
between
bank
accounts
gates
testified
they
were
not
loans
