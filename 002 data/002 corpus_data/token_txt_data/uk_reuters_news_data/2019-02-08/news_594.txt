euro
zone
banks
which
issued
large
amounts
of
debt
under
english
law
could
have
more
time
to
meet
requirements
after
britain
leaves
the
european
union
the
bloc
s
agency
responsible
to
winding
down
failing
lenders
said
on
thursday
under
eu
banking
rules
banks
must
issue
special
debt
known
as
mrel
minimum
requirement
for
own
funds
and
eligible
liabilities
that
can
be
converted
into
capital
if
a
crisis
burns
through
their
core
capital
buffer
the
single
resolution
board
srb
has
estimated
that
banks
in
the
euro
zone
have
around
billion
euros
billion
pounds
of
debt
issued
under
english
law
if
no
agreement
is
found
between
britain
and
the
eu
on
mutual
acceptance
of
these
outstanding
bonds
to
absorb
losses
euro
zone
banks
will
have
to
issue
new
bonds
to
cover
likely
capital
gaps
after
britain
leaves
the
eu
in
a
report
released
on
thursday
the
srb
said
that
for
banks
that
after
brexit
could
have
a
mrel
shortfall
caused
by
debt
issued
under
english
law
an
extension
of
transitional
periods
to
meet
their
requirements
could
be
considered
this
is
the
first
time
the
agency
which
is
in
charge
of
setting
the
mrel
for
top
euro
zone
banks
is
saying
it
could
be
more
lenient
so
far
the
agency
has
advised
banks
to
introduce
clauses
in
contracts
of
bonds
issued
under
english
law
that
would
clarify
they
could
be
wiped
out
in
case
of
liquidation
under
eu
rules
the
srb
repeated
on
thursday
this
call
and
also
urged
banks
to
consider
issuing
new
debt
under
the
law
of
one
of
the
remaining
eu
countries
to
avoid
possible
legal
uncertainty
in
the
future
banks
who
fail
to
meet
their
mrel
targets
could
be
forced
to
sell
assets
or
be
subject
to
other
punitive
measures
an
srb
official
also
clarified
that
british
or
other
foreign
banks
with
operations
in
the
euro
zone
should
have
sufficient
buffers
at
their
euro
zone
subsidiaries
as
if
they
were
banks
a
requirement
that
could
increase
costs
for
foreign
lenders
