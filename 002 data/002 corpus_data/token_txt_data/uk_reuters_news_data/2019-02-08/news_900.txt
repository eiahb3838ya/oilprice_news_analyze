turkish
authorities
believe
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
was
killed
inside
his
country
s
consulate
in
istanbul
last
week
turkish
sources
said
in
what
they
described
as
the
deliberate
targeting
of
a
prominent
critic
of
the
gulf
kingdom
s
rulers
as
a
journalist
he
interviewed
al
qaeda
leader
osama
bin
laden
several
times
in
afghanistan
and
sudan
and
served
twice
as
editor
of
al
watan
newspaper
khashoggi
gained
a
wide
following
with
his
appearances
on
arab
satellite
television
networks
a
consummate
insider
he
advised
prince
turki
former
saudi
intelligence
chief
and
has
also
been
close
to
billionaire
investor
prince
alwaleed
bin
talal
a
year
ago
khashoggi
left
saudi
arabia
after
he
said
the
authorities
had
instructed
him
to
stop
tweeting
in
his
columns
in
the
washington
post
khashoggi
had
been
escalating
his
criticism
of
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
accusing
him
of
repressing
the
saudi
people
creating
a
mess
in
lebanon
and
prosecuting
a
cruel
war
in
yemen
here
are
excerpts
from
his
writings
in
the
washington
post
sep
saudi
arabia
wasn
t
always
this
repressive
now
it
s
unbearable
it
anguishes
me
to
speak
with
other
saudi
friends
in
istanbul
and
london
who
are
also
in
there
are
at
least
seven
of
us
are
we
going
to
be
the
core
of
a
saudi
diaspora
we
spend
endless
hours
on
the
phone
trying
to
understand
this
wave
of
arrests
that
have
included
my
friend
businessman
and
thoughtful
twitter
personality
essam
it
was
just
last
tuesday
that
he
returned
home
from
the
united
states
having
been
part
of
an
official
saudi
delegation
that
is
how
breathtakingly
fast
you
can
fall
out
of
favor
with
saudi
arabia
it
is
all
quite
shocking
but
this
has
not
been
business
as
usual
in
my
nov
saudi
arabia
s
crown
prince
is
acting
like
putin
as
of
now
i
would
say
mohammed
bin
salman
is
acting
like
putin
he
is
imposing
very
selective
justice
the
crackdown
on
even
the
most
constructive
criticism
the
demand
for
complete
loyalty
with
a
significant
or
else
remains
a
serious
challenge
to
the
crown
prince
s
desire
to
be
seen
as
a
modern
enlightened
leader
mohammed
bin
salman
rather
famously
bought
a
million
yacht
in
rumours
rippled
across
the
kingdom
of
other
extravagances
the
buck
stops
at
the
leader
s
door
he
is
not
above
the
standard
he
is
now
setting
for
the
rest
of
his
family
and
for
the
nov
saudi
arabia
is
creating
a
total
mess
in
lebanon
as
if
we
arabs
need
another
crisis
in
our
shattered
world
but
that
s
exactly
what
s
coming
after
the
mysterious
resignation
of
lebanese
prime
minister
saad
hariri
from
riyadh
last
saturday
and
declarations
from
the
saudi
royal
court
that
iran
has
officially
crossed
a
red
line
the
impulsivity
of
mbs
has
been
a
consistent
theme
from
the
war
in
yemen
to
the
wave
of
arrests
of
constructive
critics
royals
and
senior
officials
accused
of
corruption
the
severity
of
saudi
arabia
s
action
against
lebanon
mirrors
the
blockade
of
qatar
in
june
abrupt
with
no
room
for
negotiation
jan
why
saudi
arabia
s
crown
prince
should
be
worried
about
iran
s
protests
indeed
many
saudis
must
find
it
contradictory
for
their
media
to
hail
iranians
protesting
price
increases
in
iran
while
saudis
are
banned
from
protesting
the
approximately
doubled
cost
of
fuel
and
the
introduction
of
a
sales
tax
for
the
first
time
in
the
country
which
took
effect
just
last
week
salih
shehi
a
prominent
columnist
was
arrested
for
appearing
on
tv
and
defending
the
people
s
right
to
object
ironically
these
protests
may
well
overlap
with
the
seventh
anniversary
of
the
egyptian
revolution
that
changed
the
face
of
the
arab
world
perhaps
arabs
and
saudis
will
dare
to
say
that
they
also
want
some
of
that
iranian
feb
what
saudi
arabia
s
crown
prince
can
learn
from
queen
elizabeth
ii
mbs
s
downsizing
and
relative
humbling
of
the
house
of
saud
is
welcome
news
but
maybe
he
should
learn
from
the
british
royal
house
that
has
earned
true
stature
respect
and
success
by
trying
a
little
humility
himself
if
mbs
can
listen
to
his
critics
and
acknowledge
that
they
too
love
their
country
he
can
actually
enhance
his
aug
saudi
arabia
can
not
afford
to
pick
fights
with
canada
instead
of
lashing
out
at
canada
shouldn
t
we
ask
why
canada
has
turned
against
us
we
saudi
citizens
need
to
see
the
bigger
picture
canada
raised
the
flag
against
human
rights
abuses
in
saudi
arabia
surely
we
can
not
arbitrarily
arrest
female
activists
and
expect
the
world
to
turn
a
blind
sep
saudi
arabia
s
crown
prince
must
restore
dignity
to
his
country
by
ending
yemen
s
cruel
war
the
longer
this
cruel
war
lasts
in
yemen
the
more
permanent
the
damage
will
be
the
people
of
yemen
will
be
busy
fighting
poverty
cholera
and
water
scarcity
and
rebuilding
their
country
the
crown
prince
must
bring
an
end
to
the
violence
and
restore
the
dignity
of
the
birthplace
