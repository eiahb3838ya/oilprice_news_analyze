lawmakers
in
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
conservative
party
on
wednesday
triggered
a
confidence
vote
in
her
leadership
plunging
the
country
s
planned
divorce
from
the
european
union
into
deeper
uncertainty
reaction
prime
minister
theresa
may
i
will
contest
that
vote
with
everything
i
ve
a
change
of
leadership
in
the
conservative
party
now
would
put
our
country
s
future
at
risk
and
create
uncertainty
when
we
can
least
afford
weeks
spent
tearing
ourselves
apart
will
only
create
more
division
just
as
we
should
be
standing
together
to
serve
our
labour
party
leader
jeremy
corbyn
the
time
for
dithering
and
delay
by
this
government
is
over
the
prime
minister
has
negotiated
her
deal
she
has
told
us
it
is
the
best
and
only
deal
available
there
can
be
no
more
excuses
no
more
running
away
put
it
before
parliament
and
let
s
have
the
vote
will
she
now
put
this
deal
before
parliament
and
halt
this
escalating
crisis
that
is
so
damaging
to
the
lives
of
so
many
people
in
this
country
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
philip
hammond
the
prime
minister
has
worked
hard
in
the
national
interest
since
the
day
she
took
office
and
will
have
my
full
support
in
the
vote
tonight
her
deal
means
we
leave
the
eu
on
time
whilst
protecting
our
jobs
and
our
john
normand
head
of
fundamental
strategy
jp
morgan
if
the
government
is
led
by
a
hard
brexiteer
or
parliament
opts
for
a
no
deal
i
would
say
sterling
could
fall
percent
it
could
fall
the
reason
is
from
there
the
focus
will
be
around
potential
capital
flight
or
hedging
as
opposed
to
the
liquidation
of
investor
positions
by
traditional
asset
managers
or
hedge
funds
the
base
case
is
eventually
there
will
be
a
realisation
that
soft
brexit
is
better
than
hard
brexit
and
that
there
s
only
one
option
to
achieve
that
soft
brexit
and
a
vote
will
pass
even
if
there
s
one
or
two
failures
first
but
the
timeline
on
this
is
obviously
unclear
and
there
are
other
potential
scenarios
which
add
to
the
volatility
of
the
emmanuel
cau
head
of
european
equity
strategy
at
barclays
we
still
think
a
crash
out
is
very
unlikely
our
base
case
is
that
we
get
a
deal
but
the
market
is
starting
to
price
in
a
very
high
probability
of
a
no
deal
scenario
i
don
t
think
we
can
bet
on
who
will
win
i
think
it
s
about
the
market
s
interpretation
of
the
capacity
of
the
person
in
charge
to
get
a
deal
and
about
the
timing
left
to
get
a
deal
done
i
m
not
so
keen
to
predict
a
market
move
on
a
hard
basis
because
things
can
change
so
quickly
that
i
think
no
one
is
trying
to
position
for
this
we
need
to
see
some
clarity
on
brexit
before
people
commit
new
money
to
europe
people
need
to
know
a
hard
brexit
is
going
to
be
chief
secretary
to
the
treasury
liz
truss
i
fully
support
the
prime
minister
and
believe
it
would
be
completely
wrong
to
have
a
leadership
election
now
she
is
the
right
person
to
deliver
brexit
and
has
shown
herself
to
be
strong
and
conservative
lawmaker
anna
soubry
removing
theresa
may
at
this
most
critical
of
times
is
grossly

secretary
michael
gove
i
am
absolutely
sure
the
prime
minister
will
win
i
am
backing
the
prime
minister
percent
and
i
urge
every
conservative
mp
to
do
the
same
she
is
battling
hard
for
our
country
and
no
one
is
better
placed
to
ensure
we
deliver
on
the
british
people
s
decision
to
leave
the
international
development
secretary
penny
mordaunt
the
prime
minister
has
my
full
support
not
least
because
she
has
always
done
what
she
firmly
believes
is
in
the
national
interest
our
country
needs
us
all
to
fight
for
a
good
deal
and
prepare
for
a
no
deal
scenario
all
eyes
and
hands
should
be
on
that
work
and
pensions
secretary
amber
rudd
the
pm
has
my
full
support
at
this
critical
time
we
need
to
support
and
work
with
the
pm
to
deliver
on
leaving

our
domestic
agenda

theresa
may
s
plan
would
bring
down
the
government
if
carried
forward
but
our
party
will
rightly
not
tolerate
it
conservatives
must
now
answer
whether
they
wish
to
draw
ever
closer
to
an
election
under
mrs
may
s
leadership
in
the
national
interest

must
conservative
party
donor
alexander
temerko
a
new
prime
minister
would
definitely
be
good
news
for
british
business
a
new
prime
minister
would
have
at
least
some
chance
of
making
progress
on
brexit
mrs
may
has
exhausted
all
her
options
and
her
staying
in
power
is
just
creating
more
uncertainty
for
our
economy
big
and
business
needs
a
robust
guarantee
to
plan
for
the
long
term
not
the
myopic
declaration
we
re
currently
being

we
expect
theresa

should
survive

the
big
risk
it

a

i
am
backing
theresa
may
tonight
being
pm
most
difficult
job
imaginable
right
now
and
the
last
thing
the
country
needs
is
a
damaging
and
long
leadership
contest
brexit
was
never
going
to
be
easy
but
she
is
the
best
person
to
make
sure
we
actually
leave
the
eu
on
march

secretary
sajid

the
last
thing
our
country
needs
right
now
is
a
conservative
party
leadership
election
will
be
seen
as
and
wrong
pm
has
my
full
support
and
is
best
person
to
ensure
we
leave

on
march

secretary
james

strongly
support
to
continue
as
leader
of
conservatives
and
prime
minister
now
is
not
the
time
for
this
distraction
and
even
more
uncertainty
