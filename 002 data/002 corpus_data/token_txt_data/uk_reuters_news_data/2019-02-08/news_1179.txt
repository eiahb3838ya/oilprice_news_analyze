london
reuters
british
consumers
appear
little
fazed
by
the
possibility
of
a
brexit
but
businesses
have
turned
more
worried
surveys
showed
on
friday
britain
s
headline
gauge
of
consumer
confidence
compiled
by
market
research
firm
gfk
for
the
european
commission
rose
to
in
august
from
in
july
matching

struck
in
march
and
may
economists
who
took
part
in
a
reuters
poll
had
mostly
expected
the
reading
to
remain
at
we
are
just
months
away
from
the
brexit
crunch
but
there
is
no
sign
yet
of
any
crash
in
consumer
confidence
joe
staton
gfk
s
client
strategy
director
said
the
core
index
continues
to
muddle
along
in
negative
territory
but
armageddon
seems
a
distant
prospect
he
said
prime
minister
theresa
may
is
trying
to
win
fellow
eu
leaders
round
to
her
plan
for
britain
to
keep
free
trade
for
goods
something
the
european
commission
opposes
less
than
seven
months
before
the
country
leaves
the
bloc
in
july
two
of
her
key
ministers
resigned
in
protest
at
the
plan
raising
questions
about
her
ability
to
secure
a
deal
a
separate
survey
showed
a
different
picture
among
companies
lloyds
bank
said
its
measure
of
business
confidence
in
august
fell
six
points
to
its
lowest
this
year
at
percent
dented
by
concerns
about
trading
prospects
for
the
year
ahead
and
less
economic
optimism
that
compared
with
levels
of
around
percent
before
the
brexit
referendum
confidence
held
steady
only
among
manufacturers
many
of
whom
have
seen
orders
rise
this
year
with
the
global
economy
growing
more
strongly
business
confidence
was
resilient
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
but
has
eased
back
recently
ho
a
lloyds
economist
said
this
reflects
changes
in
perceptions
of
brexit
risks
which
underscores
the
importance
of
current
the
lloyds
survey
found
a
weakening
in
hiring
intentions
by
companies
and
softer
expectations
for
pay
growth
