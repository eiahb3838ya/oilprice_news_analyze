beijing
reuters
earnings
at
china
s
industrial
firms
in
november
dropped
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
three
years
as
slackening
external
and
domestic
demand
left
businesses
facing
more
strain
in
in
a
sign
of
rising
risks
to
the
world
s
economy
the
gloomy
data
points
to
a
further
loss
of
economic
momentum
as
a
trade
dispute
with
the
united
states
piles
pressure
on
china
s
vast
manufacturing
sector
and
as
firms
bracing
for
a
tough
year
ahead
shelve
their
investment
plans
executives
say
industrial
profits
fell
percent
in
november
from
a
year
earlier
to
billion
yuan
billion
pounds
the
national
bureau
of
statistics
nbs
said
on
its
website
on
thursday
it
marked
the
first
decline
since
december
the
fall
in
profits
largely
reflected
slowing
growth
in
sales
and
producer
prices
as
well
as
rising
costs
he
ping
of
the
statistics
bureau
said
in
a
statement
accompanying
the
data
economists
expect
earnings
to
continue
to
worsen
next
year
weighed
down
by
smaller
gains
in
industrial
prices
due
to
cooling
demand
with
some
even
warning
of
the
risk
of
deflation
soft
economic
indicators
such
as
producer
prices
industrial
output
and
orders
all
point
to
further
pressure
on
corporate
profitability
said
nie
wen
a
analyst
at
hwabao
trust
adding
that
firms
revenues
have
been
hit
by
shrinking
demand
industrial
profits
next
year
might
very
well
post
a
percent
decline
on
in
november
china
s
factory
price
growth
slowed
to
the
weakest
pace
in
two
years
as
domestic
demand
lost
further
momentum
survival
is
paramount
for
us
next
year
we
will
be
more
cautious
with
our
investments
jiang
ming
chairman
of
tianming
group
that
has
businesses
in
healthcare
construction
and
finance
told
reuters
we
also
need
to
maintain
better
cashflows
and
save
our
ammunition
to
prepare
for
the
tight
tough
and
difficult
days
china
s
economy
expanded
at
the
slowest
pace
last
quarter
since
the
global
financial
crisis
hit
by
a
deleveraging
campaign
cooling
property
market
and
a
trade
dispute
with
the
united
states
and
is
expected
to
cool
further
next
year
the
growing
pressure
has
prompted
the
government
to
roll
out
a
range
of
measures
to
juice
up
demand
in
a
key
annual
economic
conference
held
this
month
the
country
s
top
leaders
said
they
will
ratchet
up
support
for
the
economy
in
by
cutting
taxes
and
keeping
liquidity
ample
while
promising
to
push
forward
trade
negotiations
with
the
united
states
at
the
beginning
of
this
month
president
donald
trump
and
his
chinese
counterpart
xi
jinping
agreed
to
a
truce
delaying
a
planned
tariff
hike
on
as
they
negotiate
a
trade
deal
yet
there
is
uncertainty
whether
the
two
sides
can
bridge
their
differences
over
a
myriad
of
issues
including
trade
and
intellectual
property
rights
to
reach
a
durable
pact
earnings
growth
at
china
s
industrial
firms
has
been
cooling
since
april
this
year
as
factory
price
gains
slowed
on
the
back
growing
strains
in
the
global
economy
the
bitter
trade
war
with
the
united
states
has
also
pressured
overall
output
and
demand
in
a
blow
to
business
investment
plans
for
the
first
eleven
months
profits
at
industrial
firms
rose
percent
from
the
same
period
a
year
earlier
to
trillion
yuan
slowing
from
a
percent
increase
in
in
the
same
period
earnings
growth
at
industrial
enterprises
also
cooled
upstream
sectors
such
as
oil
extraction
coal
and
metal
mining
still
commanded
the
lion
s
share
of
profit
gains
in
the
period
but
again
their
growth
softened
in
november
profits
for
oil
and
natural
gas
extraction
rose
percent
in
the
first
eleven
months
of
the
year
easing
off
from
a
percent
jump
for
the
next
drag
on
profits
would
likely
come
from
upstream
sectors
where
raw
material
prices
have
been
sliding
fast
hwabao

s
nie
said
with
the
arrival
of
winter
industrial
output
has
taken
a
hit
as
the
government
intensifies
a
crackdown
on
pollution
to
restrict
production
in
factories
china
s
top
steelmaking
city
tangshan
asked
steel
mills
earlier
this
month
to
cut
extra
output
during
december
and
which
is
an
additional
reduction
on
top
of
that
ordered
during
the
winter
heating
season
all
of
this
pointed
to
more
bad
news
for
businesses
next
year
we
expect
the
downtrend
in
industrial
profit
growth
to
extend
into
given
weakening
domestic
demand
the
continued
credit
downcycle
and
an
escalation
in
the
trade
conflict
