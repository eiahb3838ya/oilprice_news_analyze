ankara
reuters
president
tayyip
erdogan
said
on
sunday
he
was
closely
following
the
case
of
missing
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
after
turkish
officials
said
they
believed
he
had
been
killed
at
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
erdogan
told
reporters
that
authorities
were
examining
camera
footage
and
airport
records
as
part
of
their
investigation
into
the
disappearance
last
week
of
khashoggi
who
had
been
increasingly
critical
of
saudi
arabia
s
rulers
a
former
newspaper
editor
in
saudi
arabia
and
adviser
to
its
former
head
of
intelligence
khashoggi
left
the
country
last
year
saying
he
feared
retribution
for
his
criticism
of
saudi
policy
in
the
yemen
war
and
its
crackdown
on
dissent
on
tuesday
he
entered
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
to
get
documents
for
his
forthcoming
marriage
saudi
officials
say
he
left
shortly
afterwards
but
his
fiancee
who
was
waiting
outside
said
he
never
came
out
two
turkish
sources
told
reuters
turkish
authorities
believe
khashoggi
was
deliberately
killed
inside
the
consulate
a
view
echoed
by
one
of
erdogan
s
advisers
yasin
aktay
who
is
also
a
friend
of
the
saudi
journalist
my
sense
is
that
he
has
been
killed
in
the
consulate
aktay
said
erdogan
said
he
was
personally
following
the
issue
without
saying
what
he
believed
had
happened
to
khashoggi
entries
and
exits
into
the
embassy
airport
transits
and
all
camera
records
are
being
looked
at
and
followed
we
want
to
swiftly
get
results
he
said
adding
without
explanation
my
expectation
is
still
a
saudi
source
at
the
consulate
denied
that
khashoggi
had
been
killed
at
the
mission
and
said
in
a
statement
that
the
accusations
were
baseless
the
consulate
has
also
denied
that
khashoggi
was
abducted
the
united
states
is
seeking
information
a
state
department
official
said
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
confirm
these
reports
but
we
are
following
them
closely
the
official
said
khashoggi
s
fiancee
could
not
immediately
be
contacted
but
she
said
in
a
tweet
that
there
had
been
no
official
confirmation
of
the
turkish
sources
statements
jamal
was
not
killed
and
i
do
not
believe
he
was
killed
hatice
cengiz
posted
another
turkish
security
source
told
reuters
that
a
group
of
saudi
nationals
including
some
officials
had
arrived
in
istanbul
in
two
planes
and
entered
the
consulate
on
the
same
day
khashoggi
was
there
and
later
left
the
country
the
source
said
turkish
officials
were
trying
to
identify
them
turkey
s
anadolu
news
agency
also
reported
that
the
group
of
saudis
were
briefly
at
the
consulate
khashoggi
is
a
familiar
face
on
political
talk
shows
on
arab
satellite
television
networks
and
used
to
advise
prince
turki
former
saudi
intelligence
chief
and
ambassador
to
the
united
states
and
britain
over
the
past
year
he
has
written
columns
for
newspapers
including
the
washington
post
criticising
saudi
policies
towards
qatar
and
canada
the
war
in
yemen
and
a
crackdown
on
dissent
which
has
seen
dozens
of
people
detained
i
have
left
my
home
my
family
and
my
job
and
i
am
raising
my
voice
he
wrote
in
september
to
do
otherwise
would
betray
those
who
languish
in
prison
i
can
speak
when
so
many
can
not
two
months
later
writing
about
the
detentions
of
scores
of
saudi
royals
senior
officials
and
businessmen
accused
of
corruption
he
said
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
dispensed
selective
justice
and
said
there
was
complete
intolerance
for
even
mild
criticism
of
the
crown
prince
khashoggi
s
disappearance
is
likely
to
further
deepen
divisions
between
turkey
and
saudi
arabia
relations
were
already
strained
after
turkey
sent
troops
to
the
gulf
state
of
qatar
last
year
in
a
show
of
support
after
its
gulf
neighbours
including
saudi
arabia
imposed
an
embargo
on
doha
erdogan
whose
ak
party
is
rooted
in
political
islam
also
supported
a
government
in
egypt
led
by
the
muslim
brotherhood
which
saudi
arabia
has
designated
a
terrorist
movement
erdogan
s
adviser
aktay
told
reuters
that
turkish
authorities
believed
the
group
of
saudi
nationals
were
most
certainly
involved
in
his
disappearance
the
saudis
are
saying
we
can
come
investigate
but
they
have
of
course
disposed
of
the
body
he
said
adding
that
he
believed
saudi
statements
about
a
lack
of
footage
from
security
cameras
were
insincere
saudi
mohammad
told
reuters
on
saturday
that
the
consulate
s
own
security
cameras
showed
only
a
live
stream
and
did
not
record
footage
so
they
could
not
provide
evidence
of
khashoggi
s
movements
the
committee
to
protect
journalists
said
it
was
alarmed
by
reports
khashoggi
may
have
been
killed
inside
the
consulate
the
saudi
authorities
must
immediately
give
a
full
and
credible
accounting
of
what
happened
to
khashoggi
inside
its
diplomatic
mission
