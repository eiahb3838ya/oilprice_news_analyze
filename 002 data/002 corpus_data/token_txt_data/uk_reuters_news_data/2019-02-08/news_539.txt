nissan ends ghosn's two-decade reign with last-minute renault backing
yokohama
reuters
nissan
s
board
voted
unanimously
to
oust
chairman
carlos
ghosn
over
allegations
of
financial
misconduct
after
french
partner
renault
backed
away
from
a
demand
to
postpone
the
decision
on
their
alliance
leader
s
fate
the
vote
supported
by
renault
appointees
on
the
nissan
board
after
a
meeting
may
begin
to
defuse
a
crisis
that
threatened
to
upend
the
alliance
and
spark
a
diplomatic
rift
between
japan
and
france
renault
s
main
shareholder
it
also
drew
a
firm
line
under
ghosn
s
stewardship
of
the
car
empire
that
was
his
life
s
work
ghosn
was
arrested
in
japan
on
monday
after
a
nissan
investigation
uncovered
evidence
of
serious
wrongdoing
including
of
his
remuneration
and
personal
use
of
company
assets
the
board
acknowledged
the
significance
of
the
matter
and
confirmed
that
the
longstanding
alliance
partnership
with
renault
remains
unchanged
the
japanese
carmaker
said
nissan
said
its
board
dismissed
ghosn
and
fellow
representative
director
greg
kelly
an
alleged
after
reviewing
a
detailed
report
of
the
internal
investigation
the
first
time
renault
had
seen
key
findings
with
ghosn
and
kelly
still
in
custody
neither
man
has
been
able
to
defend
himself
publicly
against
the
allegations
before
the
meeting
two
renault
board
directors
had
demanded
a
postponement
of
the
vote
to
fire
ghosn
until
the
internal
probe
and
legal
proceedings
were
complete
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
failing
that
they
had
warned
that
the
french
carmaker
would
exercise
its
right
under
the
alliance
master
agreement
to
appoint
ghosn
s
successor
and
a
fourth
renault
nominee
to
the
nissan
board
the
sources
said
the
ultimatum
was
issued
in
a
strongly
worded
response
to
nissan
ceo
hiroto
saikawa
who
had
informed
renault
in
an
earlier
confidential
missive
that
the
nissan
investigation
was
expanding
to
include
finances
nissan
is
by
renault
while
almost
percent
bigger
by
sales
it
remains
the
junior
partner
in
their
shareholding
hierarchy
with
a
smaller
reciprocal
percent
stake
in
its
french
parent
ghosn
had
been
exploring
a
deeper
that
was
resisted
by
the
japanese
firm
a
fact
which
has
fuelled
speculation
about
ulterior
motives
for
his
arrest
after
the
board
presentation
and
its
summary
of
findings
however
the
tune
in
paris
had
changed
the
accusations
are
extreme
certainly
but
they
are
also
precise
said
an
official
at
french
president
emmanuel
macron
s
elysee
palace
office
we
know
there
s
a
flourishing
conspiracy
theory
about
all
this
but
that
s
really
not
our
after
heavy
losses
earlier
in
the
week
renault
shares
were
up
percent
at
gmt
nissan
shares
closed
up
percent
the
japanese
company
did
not
announce
a
replacement
for
ghosn
confounding
reports
that
saikawa
was
to
be
appointed
interim
chairman
japanese
prosecutors
say
ghosn
and
kelly
conspired
to
understate
ghosn
s
remuneration
by
about
half
the
billion
yen
million
he
earned
at
nissan
over
five
years
from
following
an
internal
probe
resulting
from
a
whistleblower
alert
ghosn
is
also
accused
of
misappropriating
nissan
assets
and
misrepresenting
the
purpose
of
company
investments
a
nissan
executive
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
board
meeting
said
renault
s
representatives
had
initially
voiced
incomprehension
over
the
accusations
there
was
some
talk
and
frustration
about
an
unjust
arrest
he
said
but
they
suddenly
changed
when
they
heard
the
contents
and
understood
that
this
wasn
t
some
strange
japanese
newspapers
have
been
awash
with
leaked
details
of
the
tokyo
prosecutor
s
investigation
into
ghosn
asahi
shimbun
reported
on
thursday
he
had
emailed
kelly
orders
to
make
false
statements
about
his
remuneration
the
yomiuri
japan
s
daily
said
nissan
had
been
paying
ghosn
s
elder
sister
a
year
since
for
a
advisory
role
she
lived
in
a
luxury
rio
de
janeiro
apartment
funded
by
a
nissan
subsidiary
according
the
report
which
cited
unidentified
sources
mitsubishi
motors
which
joined
the
alliance
in
also
plans
to
oust
ghosn
as
chairman
next
week
renault
s
board
named
interim
replacements
on
tuesday
but
kept
ghosn
on
as
chairman
and
ceo
with
government
backing
that
stance
may
now
change
even
were
he
cleared
french
officials
now
concede
ghosn
would
be
an
unlikely
figure
to
rebuild
the
trust
of
which
he
once
appeared
to
be
the
sole
guarantor
it
really
seemed
there
was
a
common
vision
between
ghosn
and
nissan
the
elysee
official
said
but
now
we
realise
there
was
in
fact
