shares
in
debenhams
the
british
department
store
chain
that
is
fighting
for
survival
plunged
as
much
as
percent
on
friday
as
its
new
interim
chairman
began
the
task
of
trying
to
find
a
consensus
among
investors
on
the
way
forward
on
thursday
two
major
debenhams
shareholders
mike
ashley
s
sports
direct
and
middle
eastern
investor
landmark
group
forced
chief
executive
sergio
bucher
off
the
board
and
chairman
ian
cheshire
out
of
the
company
following
a
drop
in
christmas
sales
terry
duddy
debenhams
senior
independent
director
was
appointed
interim
chairman
and
said
he
would
meet
with
shareholders
to
understand
their
concerns
duddy
a
former
ceo
of
home
retail
group
wasted
no
time
meeting
ashley
informally
in
london
on
thursday
evening
a
spokesman
for
debenhams
said
sports
direct
is
debenhams
biggest
investor
with
a
percent
stake
but
its
plan
for
the
department
store
chain
is
unclear
it
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
on
friday
in
september
sports
direct
ruled
out
a
takeover
bid
shortly
after
an
outgoing
director
said
the
board
had
discussed
combining
debenhams
with
the
house
of
fraser
chain
that
sports
direct
bought
out
of
administration
in
august
for
million
pounds
million
debenhams
has
a
program
to
close
of
its
underperforming
uk
stores
over
three
to
five
years
however
ashley
wants
debenhams
to
move
faster
he
told
sky
news
last
month
he
believed
debenhams
should
carry
out
a
company
voluntary
arrangement
cva
restructuring
to
close
stores
cvas
require
the
approval
of
landlords
and
creditors
also
in
december
debenhams
declined
the
offer
of
a
million
pound
loan
from
ashley
saying
conditions
attached
to
it
could
affect
the
interests
of
other
stakeholders
debenhams
has
net
debt
of
million
pounds
and
debt
facilities
of
million
pounds
its
equity
market
value
as
of
thursday
s
close
was
just
million
pounds
a
key
focus
for
duddy
will
be
refinancing
debenhams
existing
banking
facilities
the
firm
needs
to
pass
a
banking
covenant
test
next
month
we
believe
all
options
are
being
considered
maybe
different
types
of
lenders
an
equity
rights
issue
said
analysts
at
jefferies
the
highly
unusual
situation
of
bucher
remaining
as
ceo
but
not
being
on
the
company
board
will
also
be
problematic
for
debenhams
it
is
not
tenable
for
the
ceo
not
to
be
on
the
board
the
danger
now
is
that
mike
ashley
is
allowed
in
all
the
confusion
to
buy
the
company
on
the
cheap
