had
taken
measures
to

and
the
timing
would
depend
on
factors
including
favorable
market
conditions
the

a
central
part
of

s
reform
drive
aimed
at
restructuring
the
kingdom

economy
and
reducing
its

announced
the
plan
to
sell
about

of

an
international

would
value
the
whole
company
at
trillion
or
more
several
industry
experts
questioned
whether
a
valuation
that
high
was
realistic

hindered
the
process
of
preparing
the
ipo
for
the
advisors
a
