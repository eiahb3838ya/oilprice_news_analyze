hitachi debacle strengthens franco-chinese hand in uk nuclear
paris
reuters
hitachi
s
decision
to
freeze
its
billion
nuclear
power
project
in
britain
strengthens
the
hand
of
france
s
edf
and
its
chinese
partner
in
talks
with
the
government
on
how
to
finance
new
reactors
funding
new
nuclear
plants
has
become
critical
as
hitachi
became
the
second
japanese
firm
to
say
its
british
nuclear
power
project
had
hit
the
buffers
over
financing
the
two
projects
would
have
covered
about
percent
of
britain
s
power
needs
edf
and
its
partner
china
general
nuclear
power
corporation
cgn
want
to
use
a
financing
model
under
which
investors
in
their
nuclear
projects
receive
payment
from
the
moment
they
start
construction
reducing
their
risk
but
to
proceed
with
this
approach
the
government
must
first
win
over
lawmakers
and
consumers
already
frustrated
by
hefty
energy
bills
and
costly
nuclear
projects
that
often
face
delays
the
question
is
whether
it
is
sellable
to
parliament
that
all
the
risks
go
to
the
public
but
if
that
is
not
the
case
they
will
get
no
investors
said
stephen
thomas
emeritus
professor
of
energy
policy
at
greenwich
university
edf
is
negotiating
with
the
government
on
funding
the
sizewell
c
project
using
the
regulated
asset
base
model
in
which
investors
earn
a
fixed
return
from
the
start
instead
of
waiting
years
until
construction
is
completed
before
receiving
a
return
china
general
nuclear
power
corporation
cgn
has
a
percent
stake
in
sizewell
c
while
edf
has
a
percent
stake
in
cgn
s
project
to
build
a
reactor
at
bradwell
essex
if
new
nuclear
is
to
be
successful
in
a
more
competitive
energy
market
which
i
very
much
believe
it
can
be
we
need
to
consider
a
new
approach
to
financing
future
projects
energy
secretary
greg
clark
told
parliament
saying
this
included
sizewell
and
bradwell
he
addressed
lawmakers
after
hitachi
said
it
had
failed
to
find
private
equity
investors
even
though
the
government
had
considered
partly
funding
it
with
taxpayer
s
money
that
announcement
followed
toshiba
s
decision
in
november
to
scrap
its
nugen
project
in
britain
after
its
reactor
unit
westinghouse
went
bankrupt
and
it
failed
to
find
a
buyer
for
the
plan
specialists
say
both
projects
were
doomed
from
the
start
only
utilities
have
the
steady
cash
flows
to
fund
such
projects
but
most
european
utilities
pulled
out
of
britain
s
nuclear
plans
after
the
fukushima
disaster
led
to
rising
safety
costs
and
as
renewable
energy
became
a
more
competitive
investment
prospect
the
regulated
asset
base
model
may
now
be
one
of
the
few
remaining
options
to
fund
new
nuclear
plants
in
europe
it
is
commonly
used
to
fund
construction
of
electricity
transmission
lines
and
in
britain
has
been
used
to
fund
the
thames
tideway
tunnel
a
super
sewer
for
london
dialogue
about
a
regulated
asset
base
financing
model
for
sizewell
c
is
progressing
an
edf
official
said
but
the
model
has
not
be
used
in
the
nuclear
industry
so
talks
are
likely
to
be
tough
as
the
government
seeks
a
clear
outline
of
how
much
it
would
have
to
spend
over
a
specified
period
and
works
to
avoid
writing
a
blank
cheque
to
cover
cost
overruns
the
government
intends
to
publish
its
assessment
by
the
summer
at
the
latest
for
now
the
only
nuclear
plant
under
construction
in
britain
is
edf
s
hinkley
point
c
project
in
which
cgn
also
has
a
percent
stake
the
deal
to
fund
that
plant
involved
edf
taking
on
the
financing
and
bearing
the
full
risk
for
construction
delays
or
cost
overruns
in
return
it
was
guaranteed
a
power
price
of
up
to
pounds
per
for
years
more
than
twice
the
market
rate
when
signed
that
drew
fierce
criticism
from
lawmakers
and
the
public
for
being
too
generous
and
there
are
no
plans
to
repeat
it
after
the
hitachi
and
toshiba
announcements
the
government
is
now
depending
on
just
edf
and
cgn
to
deliver
on
its
plans
for
a
fleet
of
new
reactors
to
meet
energy
demand
as
it
phases
out
old
nuclear
facilities
and
plants
britain
s
energy
security
and
decarbonisation
strategy
are
hanging
by
a
thread
