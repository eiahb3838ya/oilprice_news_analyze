why are iraq's kirkuk oilfields so important?
dhabi

iraq
s
oilfields
in
the
disputed
kirkuk
region
have
taken
on
new
significance
after
the
united
states
restored
oil
sanctions
against
neighboring
iran
washington
is
pressuring
baghdad
to
resume
exports
that
stopped
last
year
iraq
aims
to
raise
its
export
capacity
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
the
coming
years
from
less
than
million
bpd
currently
million
of
which
could
come
via
kirkuk
but
that
resumption
is
not
just
a
question
of
turning
the
tap
back
on
volume
and
revenue
the
halting
of
exports
from
kirkuk
stopped
nearly
bpd
flowing
out
of
iraq
towards
turkey
and
international
markets
causing
a
net
revenue
loss
of
some
billion
since
the
stoppage
last
year
most
of
iraq
s
exports
come
from
southern
fields
but
kirkuk
is
one
of
the
biggest
and
oldest
oilfields
in
the
middle
east
estimated
to
contain
about
billion
barrels
of
recoverable
oil
the
united
states
also
sees
kirkuk
as
an
option
to
help
offset
global
shortfall
in
oil
supply
caused
by
its
sanctions
on
iran
which
forbid
purchasing
iranian
oil
washington
has
pressured
baghdad
to
suspend
all
shipments
of
oil
to
iran
and
resume
flows
from
kirkuk
to
turkey
industry
sources
say
exports
have
been
on
hold
since
october
when
iraqi
government
forces
took
control
of
kirkuk
from
the
kurdish
authorities
in
northern
iraq
in
response
to
a
referendum
calling
for
kurdish
independence
the
kurds
had
controlled
kirkuk
and
its
oilfields
after
islamic
state
militants
drove
the
iraqi
army
out
in
and
kurdish
forces
in
turn
ejected
the
militants
resumption
of
exports
from
kirkuk
depends
on
negotiations
between
baghdad
and
the
kurds
the
pipeline
baghdad
once
used
for
exports
via
turkey
was
wrecked
by
islamic
state
leaving
only
one
working
pipeline
built
and
controlled
by
the
kurds
iraq
s
government
must
use
that
or
build
a
new
pipeline
it
is
considering
both
options
on
paper
baghdad
but
if
iraq
decides
to
use
the
kurdish
pipeline
to
export
oil
it
needs
to
negotiate
the
kurds
will
likely
seek
a
greater
share
of
iraqi
state
oil
revenue
in
return
baghdad
might
also
have
to
contend
with
russia
s
rosneft
which
bought
the
kurdish
section
of
the
pipeline
last
year
as
soon
as
baghdad
and
the
kurds
reach
an
agreement
hence
pressure
to
do
so
if
no
deal
is
reached
iraq
will
have
to
build
the
new
pipeline
which
could
take
around
two
years
the
rosneft
pipeline
has
been
upgraded
to
a
capacity
of
million
bpd
which
could
accommodate
a
current
bpd
coming
from
other
oilfields
in
kurdistan
plus
the
bpd
that
would
come
from
kirkuk
kurdish
authorities
say
iraqi
authorities
say
they
still
need
to
feed
local
refineries
where
kirkuk
s
current
output
is
being
diverted
so
even
if
exports
from
kirkuk
resume
they
won
t
exceed
bpd
at
first
meaning
total
exports
via
kurdistan
would
be
only
bpd
that
would
be
smaller
than
peak
kurdish
exports
of
bpd
before
the
failed
referendum
and
not
enough
to
help
turkey
cut
its
reliance
on
iranian
oil
iraq
and
iran
were
exchanging
only
small
volumes
of
oil
before
the
new
sanctions
around
bpd
in
each
direction
including
from
kirkuk
but
iraq
s
economy
as
a
whole
is
highly
dependent
on
trade
with
iran
iranian
gas
supplies
feed
iraqi
power
stations
for
example
washington
has
given
iraq
a
waiver
for
iranian
gas
as
well
as
food
items
but
says
this
is
only
temporary
causing
uncertainty
in
baghdad
