question for tusk on whether brexit language is helpful - may's spokesman
london
reuters
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
spokesman
said
on
wednesday
it
was
a
question
for
european
council
president
donald
tusk
on
whether
his
choice
of
language
about
brexit
supporters
was
helpful
responding
to
tusk
s
remarks
in
brussels
earlier
in
particularly
outspoken
remarks
after
a
meeting
with
irish
prime
minister
leo
varadkar
tusk
said
i
ve
been
wondering
what
that
special
place
in
hell
looks
like
for
those
who
promoted
brexit
without
even
a
sketch
of
a
plan
how
to
carry
it
out
the
spokesman
told
reporters
i
think
it
s
a
question
for
donald
tusk
as
to
whether
he
considers
the
use
of
that
kind
of
language
helpful
and
i
appreciate
that
was
difficult
this
morning
since
he
didn
t
take
any
the
first
thing
donald
tusk
said
was
our
most
important
task
is
to
prevent
a
no
deal
the
deal
that
was
on
the
table
was
rejected
by
votes
by
mps
members
of
parliament
and
so
if
mps
are
to
support
that
clearly
something
has
got
to
