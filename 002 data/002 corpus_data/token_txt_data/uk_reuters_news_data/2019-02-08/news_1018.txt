mission
the
amount
maezawa
is
paying
for
the
trip

he
told

the
total
sum
was
much
higher
than
the
cost
of
a
basquiat
painting
musk
said
maezawa
had
outlaid
a
significant
deposit
and
would
have
a
material
impact

estimated
at
about
billion

s
new
shepard

are
likely
to
cost
around
to
at
least
to
start
reuters
reported
in
july
these
trips
were
not
attractive
given
the
limited
amount
of
time
spent
in
maezawa
told
reuters
if
i
m
going
to
go
to
space
i
d
rather
go
as
far
as
i
can
he
said
maezawa
has
already
shown
his
penchant
for
fast
machines
splashing
out
on
vehicles
including
the
bugatti
chiron
sports
car
and
the
landaulet
suv
and
last
month
he
tweeted
that
his
new
jet
s
interior
is
being
fashioned
by
luxury
label
hermes
he
is
also
looking
to
acquire
his
own
baseball
team
telling
reuters
an
announcement
could
come
this
year
a
move
that
would
mark
zozo
s
place
in
the
corporate
big
leagues
along
with
tech
giants
such
as
softbank
and
rakuten
while
space
flight
is
a
more
risky
proposition
with
maezawa
in
his
late
by
he
said
there
are
no
training
plans
yet
in
place
spacex
is
going
to
be
doing
many
many
test
flights
to
ensure
safety
and
we
will
wait
for
that
to
happen
before
we
go
maezawa
told
reuters
zozo
shares
fell
as
much
as
percent
and
closed
down
percent
still
a
jaunt
around
the
moon
would
provide
publicity
for
zozo
which
has
ambitious
overseas
sales
targets
to
be
driven
by
its
private
clothing
line
the
diminutive
maezawa
who
as
a
young
man
struggled
to
find
clothes
that
fit
hopes
to
revolutionise
the
fashion
industry
through
his
zozosuit
which
once
donned
allows
users
to
upload
their
body
measurements
and
order
a
growing
number
of
items
spacex
has
already
upended
the
space
industry
with
its
relatively
reusable
falcon
rockets
the
company
has
completed
more
than
successful
falcon
launches
and
snagged
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
contracts
including
deals
with
nasa
and
the
department
of
defense
when
asked
about
boeing
co
ceo
dennis
muilenburg
s
prediction
that
the
first
humans
will
be
carried
to
mars
on
a
boeing
rocket
musk
responded
game
on

sound
of
cheers
