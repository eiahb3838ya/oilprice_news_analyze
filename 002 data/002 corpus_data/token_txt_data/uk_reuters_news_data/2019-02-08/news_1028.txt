totaling

through
its
small
estonian
branch

of
which
the
bank
said
were
suspicious
the
danish
bank
detailed
compliance
and
control
failings
amid
growing
calls
for
a
european
union
crackdown
on
financial
crime
after
a
series
of
money
laundering
scandals
which
have
attracted
the
attention
of
authorities
even
though
i
was
personally
cleared
from
a
legal
point
of
view
i
hold
the
ultimate
responsibility
there
is
no
doubt
that
we
as
an
organization
have
failed
in
this
situation
and
did
not
live
up
to
expectations
borgen
who
will
stay
on
until
a
new
ceo
is
appointed
told
a
press
conference
borgen
was
in
charge
of
danske
bank
s
international
operations
including
estonia
between
and
while
the
report
shed
some
light
on
the
bank
s
activities
in
estonia
investors
are
concerned
whether
the
united
states
which
has
placed
sanctions
on
russia
will
punish
it
as
this
is
the
largest
money
laundering
scandal
in
european
history
and
danske
bank
is
a
major
bank
that
sends
dollars
around
the
world
i
imagine
that
this
will
certainly
get
the
attention
of
the

told

danish
politicians
were
critical
of
danske
bank
for
not
revealing
exactly
how
much
money
was
allegedly
laundered
and
not
saying
who
was
legally
responsible
for
the
lapses
it
is
deeply
embarrassing
that
for
so
many
years
there
have
been
transactions
that
should
not
have
taken
place
much
of
it
is
expected
to
be
money
laundering
and
that
is
simply
not
good
enough

in
its
summary
of
a
report
covering
around
customers
and
million
payments
between
and
that
borgen
chairman
ole
andersen
and
the
board
did
not
breach
their
legal
obligations
andersen
said
the
bank
had
made
an
assessment
of
whether
it
violated
laws
but
declined
to
share
its
conclusion
when
asked
at

said
adding
that
around
a

of

whose
already
battered
shares
fell
by
nearly
percent
said
some
customers
had
been
examined
and
it
expected
a
significant
part
of
the
payments
to
be
suspicious
shares
in
danske

had
doubled
in

from
when
borgen
took
over
in
to
july
but
have
since
lost
more
than
a
third
as
allegations
of
suspicious
transactions
increased
and
denmark
and
estonia
began
criminal
investigations
the
bank
said
it
had
taken
action
including
warnings
dismissals
loss
of
bonus
payments
and
reporting
to
the
authorities
against
current
and
former
staff
as
well
as
overhauling

to
have
failed
in

million
this
month
after
admitting
criminals
had
been
able
to
launder
money
through
its
accounts
and
earlier
this
year
authorities
accused
latvia
s
ablv
of
covering
up
money
laundering
leading
to
the
bank
being
denied
dollar
funding
and
its
swift
collapse
while
danske
does
not
have
a
banking
license
in
the
united

banning
correspondent

from
dealing

amount

performance
the
report
found
that
danske
bank
failed
to
take
proper
action
in
when
it
was
criticized
by
the
estonian
regulator
and
received
information
from
its
danish
counterpart
that
pointed
to
criminal
activity
in
its
pure
form
including
money
laundering
estimated
at
billions
of
rubles
monthly
and
when
a
whistleblower
raised
problems
at
the
estonian
branch
in
early
the
allegations
were
not
properly
investigated
and
were
not
shared
with
the
board
danske
said
adding
that
measures
to
get
its
business
there
under
control
had
been
insufficient
danske
bank
also
said
the
estonian
branch
did
not
employ
its
laundering
procedures
because
it
had
not
migrated
its
baltic
banking
activities
onto
the
bank
s
it
platform
as
this
would
have
been
too
expensive
the
report
describes
serious
shortcomings
in
the

of

were
not

in

danske
bank
which
cut
its
forecast
for
annual
net
profit
to
billion
danish
crowns
from
a
previous
billion
has
successfully
overcome
previous
traumas
the
government
had
to
step
in
when

froze

borgen
had
managed
to
improve
the

image
and
earnings
in
part
by
cutting
costs
shifting
its
