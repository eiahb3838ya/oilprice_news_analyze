on
monday
not
to
underestimate
the
west
after
a
brazen
nerve
agent
attack
on
a
retired
double
agent
in
england
stoked
fears
about
russian
covert
activity
abroad
in
his
second
major
speech
since
being
named
in
to
head
the
secret
intelligence
service
or
alex
younger
ranged
across
the
global
threats
faced
by
britain
as
it
prepares
to
exit
the
european
union
in
less
than
four
months
russia
the
only
national
adversary
named
in
his
scripted
speech
has
a
stance
of
perpetual
confrontation
with
the
west
said
younger
citing
the
nerve
agent
attack
on
former
russian
agent
sergei
skripal
in
march
in
the
english
city
of
salisbury
western
allies
ordered
the
biggest
expulsion
of
russian
diplomats
since
the
height
of
the
cold
war
in
response
to
the

in
which
britain
said
russian
gru
military

had
used

the
university
of
st
andrews
in
scotland
where
he
once
studied
economics
and
computer
science
before
joining
the
british
army
and
then
our
intention
is
for
the
russian
state
to
conclude
that
whatever
the
benefits
it
thinks
it
is
accruing
from
this
activity
they
are
not
worth
the
risk
said
younger
moscow
has
repeatedly
denied
any
involvement
and
accused
british
intelligence
agencies
of
staging
the
attack
to
stoke
hysteria
skripal

officer
in
russian
military
intelligence
betrayed
dozens
of
spies
to
though
he
was
later
pardoned
and
exchanged
in
a
cold
spy
swap
the
motive
of
the
attack
remains
unclear
as
is
the
logic
of
using
such
an
exotic
nerve
agent
which
has
overt
links
to
russia
s
soviet
past
i
should
emphasise
that
even
as
the
russian
state
seeks
to
destabilise
us
we
do
not
seek
to
destabilise
russia
we
do
not
seek
escalation

significant
capital
political
clout
and
technological
dominance
basically
power

is
going
east
he
said
that
s
a
new
political
reality
we
need
to
adjust
he
said
reliance
on
chinese
technology
was
something
britain
needed
to
discuss
though
a
bigger
issue
was
the
likely
chinese
future
dominance
of
emerging
technologies
younger
said
he
had
been
struck
by
president
xi
jinping
s
made
in
china
ambitions
and
that
beijing
could
within
decades
dominate
all
of
the
key
emerging
technologies

in
a
career

joined
as
the
soviet
union

crumbling

that
while
technologies
advanced
human
intelligence
remained
crucial

will
become
even
more
