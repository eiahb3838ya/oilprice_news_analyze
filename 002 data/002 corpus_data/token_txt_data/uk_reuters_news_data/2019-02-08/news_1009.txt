budget deficit jumps in august, but little pressure on hammond
london
reuters
britain
s
budget
deficit
unexpectedly
widened
in
august
driven
by
subdued
tax
receipts
a
rise
in
the
state
pension
and
higher
eu
budget
payments
but
chancellor
philip
hammond
probably
still
has
room
to
ease
his
grip
on
spending
later
this
year
the
deficit
last
month
stood
at
billion
pounds
almost
double
the
median
forecast
in
a
reuters
poll
and
higher
than
a
shortfall
of
billion
pounds
in
august
the
office
for
national
statistics
ons
said
on
friday
while
this
marked
the
first
increase
in
net
borrowing
for
the
month
of
august
in
three
years
the
shortfall
is
unlikely
to
ring
alarm
bells
for
hammond
the
deficit
for
the
first
five
months
of
the
current
financial
year
was
down
percent
from
the
same
point
a
year
ago
at
billion
pounds
helped
by
a
cut
in
the
estimated
size
of
the
shortfall
in
previous
months
of
the
year
hammond
reiterated
his
focus
on
cutting
britain
s
high
debt
levels
in
order
to
allow
him
to
spend
more
this
is
good
progress
but
we
need
to
keep
up
our
efforts
so
we
can
invest
in
our
public
services
and
our
future
he
said
on
twitter
samuel
tombs
an
economist
with
pantheon
macroeconomics
said
the
slowdown
in
tax
receipts
in
august
might
make
hammond
a
little
nervous
as
he
prepares
his
annual
autumn
budget
statement
but
he
would
probably
be
able
to
avoid
raising
taxes
to
pay
for
an
increase
in
spending
on
the
health
service
promised
by
prime
minister
theresa
may
we
expect
the
chancellor
to
ease
off
austerity
measures
in
other
areas
too
ensuring
that
fiscal
policy
doesn
t
dampen
gdp
growth
next
year
when
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
tombs
said
the
deficit
for
august
alone
was
exacerbated
by
a
billion
pound
increase
in
european
union
budget
contributions
compared
with
an
unusually
small
outflow
this
time
a
year
ago
the
ons
also
pointed
to
a
percent
annual
increase
in
the
state
pension
overall
tax
receipts
last
month
edged
up
by
an
annual
percent
while
spending
rose
percent
for
the
period
however
receipts
were
up
percent
while
expenditure
was
up
by
only
percent
britain
s
economy
has
slowed
as
it
heads
for
brexit
in
march
next
year
but
not
by
as
much
as
feared
at
the
time
of
the
referendum
decision
to
leave
the
bloc
britain
s
budget
deficit
stood
at
nearly
percent
of
gdp
when
hammond
s
predecessor
george
osborne
started
a
programme
of
public
spending
cuts
in
it
is
expected
to
fall
below
percent
this
year
leading
to
calls
on
hammond
from
within
his
conservative
party
to
allow
more
spending
public
support
for
increased
levels
of
tax
to
fund
more
public
spending
has
hit
a
high
the
national
centre
for
social
research
survey
showed
