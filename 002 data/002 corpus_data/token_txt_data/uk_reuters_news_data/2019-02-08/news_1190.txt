french
and
british
fisherman
pledged
talks
to
quell
a
dispute
over
access
to
the
seabed
in
the
baie
de
seine
after
french
vessels
chased
their
rivals
out
of
the
zone
hurling
projectiles
and
insults
french
vessels
rammed
british
scallop
dredgers
on
tuesday
off
the
coast
of
normandy
in
an
attack
english
fisherman

cardell
described
as
like
a
scene
out
of
vietnam
they
just
came
out
and
surrounded
our
fleet
throwing
petrol
bombs
it
was
mental
said
cardell
a
scallop
fisherman
from
cornwall
who
told
reuters
his
boat
was
attacked
by
about
french
scallop
fishing
boats
in
international
waters
the
french
are
irritated
that
british
fishermen
are
allowed
to
harvest
scallops
a
key
earner
for
france
s
normandy
region
throughout
the
year
while
they
are
prevented
from
doing
so
during
the
summer
graphic
navigating
brexit
waters
this
is
well
beyond
legal
behavior
we
have
asked
the
british
government
to
intervene
at
a
diplomatic
level
but
also
to
provide
protection
for
our
vessels
barrie
deas
head
of
britain
s
fishermen
s
organizations
told
bbc
radio
british
environment
minister
michael
gove
said
the
uk
boats
were
fishing
legally
he
told
bbc
television
we
can
insist
that
the
french
because
they
have
a
legal
responsibility
to
ensure
that
we
don
t
have
scenes
like
those
we
saw
earlier
this
week
ensure
that
those
waters
their
territorial
waters
are
appropriately
policed
so
that
legal
fishing
activity
can
the
head
of
normandy
s
fishing
organization
dimitri
rogoff
said
the
attack
was
spontaneous
but
acknowledged
events
spiraled
out
of
control
he
said
he
deplored
the
violence
there
should
not
be
any
brawling
that
could
end
badly
our
main
uk
counterpart
has
proposed
we
hold
talks
quickly
in
france
we
ll
receive
a
uk
delegation
in
the
coming
days
rogoff
said
on
wednesday
scallops
known
as
coquille
saint
jacques
in
france
are
one
of
just
a
few
species
whose
catch
is
governed
by
national
rather
than
european
union
regulation
france
bans
all
scallop
dredging
between
may
and
october
but
britain
allows
its
vessels
to
operate
while
british
ships
have
no
access
to
french
territorial
waters
up
to
nautical
miles
km
off
the
coast
they
can
legally
operate
in
the
expansive
baie
de
seine
that
stretches
from
cherbourg
to
dunkirk
after
the
row
dubbed
the
scallop
wars
flared
up
five
years
ago
french
and
uk
fishermen
brokered
yearly
agreements
that
saw
british
fishermen
limit
their
scallop
dredging
in
the
baie
de
seine
in
exchange
for
some
french
scallop
permits
but
in
the
past
two
years
we
feel
our
british
partners
do
not
want
to
negotiate
maybe
because
of
brexit
rogoff
said
rogoff
said
the
root
of
the
problem
is
different
economic
models
normandy
fishermen
he
said
operate
mainly
small
boats
close
to
their
own
shores
and
sell
the
scallops
live
the
british
fleet
he
said
included
floating
factories
which
freeze
and
process
the
catch
onboard
french
fishermen
argue
that
scallops
should
not
be
harvested
in
summer
when
they
reproduce
if
everybody
dredges
for
scallops
all
year
round
soon
there
will
be
none
left
