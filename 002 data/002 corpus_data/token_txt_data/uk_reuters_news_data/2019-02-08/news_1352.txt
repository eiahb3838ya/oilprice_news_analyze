england
s
run
to
the
of
the
soccer
world
cup
and
a
scorching
summer
encouraged
shoppers
in
britain
to
spend
more
on
food
drink
and
electric
fans
in
july
but
overall
spending
rose
only
slowly
according
to
a
survey
of
retailers
total
retail
sales
values
rose
by
percent
compared
with
july
the
british
retail
consortium
brc
said
the
weakest
increase
since
february
excluding
a
fall
in
april
which
was
distorted
by
the
timing
of
easter
last
month
s
sweltering
temperatures
kept
shoppers
focused
on
eating
drinking
and
keeping
cool
food
sales
had
their
best
july
in
five
years
while
fans
and
cooling
equipment
flew
off
the
shelves
helen
dickinson
the
brc
s
chief
executive
said
however
total
sales
growth
slowed
as
the
heat
laid
bare
the
underlying
weakness
in
consumer
retail
sales
fell
after
rising
in
the
previous
two
months
the
brc
said
british
shoppers
whose
spending
accounts
for
about
percent
of
the
economy
have
seen
inflation
rise
faster
than
their
pay
for
much
of
the
past
decade
although
in
recent
months
growth
in
earnings
has
turned
positive
in
real
terms
separately
on
tuesday
barclaycard
the
credit
and
debit
card
division
of
barclays
said
its
measure
of
consumer
spending
which
includes
bars
and
restaurants
rose
by
an
annual
percent
in
july
driven
by
shopping
in
supermarkets
and
an
increase
in
fuel
prices
pub
spending
rose
by
nearly
percent
the
most
since
april
last
year
helped
by
the
world
cup
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
if
this
strong
level
of
growth
continues
barclaycard
director
esme
harwood
said
it
s
clear
that
some
consumers
remain
cautious
about
what
s
to
come
with
interest
rates
rising
and
overall
confidence
in
household
finances
down
slightly
from
the
bank
of
england
last
week
raised
its
benchmark
interest
rate
for
only
the
second
time
since
the
financial
crisis
more
than
a
decade
ago
but
stressed
it
would
continue
to
raise
borrowing
costs
only
gradually
