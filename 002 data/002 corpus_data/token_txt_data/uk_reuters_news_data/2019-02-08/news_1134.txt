eu executive to propose new measures to deter migrants
brussels
reuters
the
european
union
will
announce
plans
next
week
to
strengthen
its
external
borders
and
push
foreign
states
to
do
more
to
deter
migrants
the
plans
are
a
last
effort
by
the
european
commission
led
by
juncker
to
toughen
policy
on
an
issue
that
has
divided
europe
since
when
more
than
a
million
refugees
and
migrants
arrived
across
the
mediterranean
but
disagreements
between
eu
states
make
a
comprehensive
deal
on
migration
unlikely
before
the
new
commission
and
parliament
arrive
next
year
juncker
will
also
propose
more
pathways
for
migrants
to
get
to
the
eu
legally
including
on
study
or
work
visas
as
he
makes
his
last
state
of
the
union
speech
in
the
european
parliament
next
wednesday
before
stepping
down
the
commission
will
release
proposals
including
to
enhance
the
mandate
of
the
bloc
s
frontex
agency
for
external
borders
diplomats
and
officials
said
at
the
same
time
austria
which
currently
holds
the
bloc
s
presidency
is
trying
to
break
a
deadlock
between
member
states
over
how
to
handle
refugees
and
migrants
who
arrive
by
sea
under
vienna
s
proposal
of
mandatory
solidarity
eu
states
could
accept
refugees
and
migrants
provide
experts
or
equipment
for
the
bloc
s
external
borders
or
make
other
contributions
the
plan
does
not
require
all
member
states
to
host
new
arrivals
the
eu
s
eastern
members
oppose
hosting
these
people
just
one
issue
that
has
damaged
the
bloc
s
unity
this
year
sea
arrivals
stand
at
some
people
a
fraction
of
the
mass
influx
in
that
overwhelmed
eu
states
and
stretched
services
precipitating
a
rise
in
the
bloc
s
populist
nationalist
and
parties
we
are
still
handling
an
acute
political
crisis
in
the
eu
even
though
the
arrivals
are
next
to
none
a
senior
diplomat
in
brussels
said
italy
remains
opposed
to
austria
s
plan
rome
has
pushed
more
rigid
policies
and
denied
several
rescue
ships
access
to
its
ports
it
says
other
eu
states
should
take
in
the
migrants
eu
leaders
will
discuss
migration
again
at
a
summit
in
salzburg
on
they
will
also
discuss
stepping
up
returns
and
deportations
of
people
who
make
it
to
the
eu
but
fail
to
win
asylum
the
eu
is
entering
a
campaign
season
with
european
parliament
elections
due
next
may
and
a
new
commission
to
be
installed
in
late
as
a
result
member
states
would
have
to
agree
a
new
migration
package
this
year
to
give
the
parliament
a
chance
to
approve
it
before
its
final
session
in
diplomats
say
the
commission
s
new
measures
further
develop
policies
implemented
since
that
have
contributed
to
a
sharp
decrease
in
migration
by
sea
rights
groups
say
the
policies
leave
migrants
vulnerable
to
abuses
and
death
on
land
and
at
sea
the
bloc
s
idea
for
regional
disembarkation
platforms
around
the
mediterranean
aimed
to
open
eu
ports
for
rescue
ships
and
then
spread
the
migrants
on
board
across
the
bloc
the
plan
was
honed
after
an
eu
summit
last
june
that
saw
italy
and
germany
face
off
through
the
night
but
it
appears
stillborn
as
member
states
remain
reluctant
to
take
immigrants
in
let
alone
through
an
obligatory
scheme
