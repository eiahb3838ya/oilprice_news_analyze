reuters
the
united
states
and
canada
forged
a
deal
on
sunday
to
salvage
nafta
as
a
trilateral
pact
with
mexico
rescuing
a
trillion
zone
that
had
been
about
to
collapse
after
nearly
a
quarter
century
john
bode
president
and
ceo
of
the
corn
refiners
association
this
is
a
milestone
mexican
and
canadian
markets
are
very
important
to
american
farmers
ranchers
and
agribusiness
we
commend
president
trump
for
his
efforts
to
conclude
this
trilateral
agreement
we
look
forward
to
reviewing
the
agreement
text
released
randy

ceo
national
grain
and
feed
association

and
gary

given
the
integrated
nature
of
the
north
american
economy
including
within
the
food
and
agricultural
sector
it
was
extremely
important
to
reach
a
trade
agreement
that
included
all
three
countries
our
industry
is
encouraged
about
reports
that
the
final
agreement
takes
steps
to
modify
some
existing
impediments
to
agricultural
trade
including
dairy
and
will
preserve
some
form
of
the
trilateral
chapter
tariff
mechanism
contained
in
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
president
and
ceo
matthew
shay
the
national
retail
federation
we
are
pleased
a
deal
has
been
reached
that
preserves
nafta
s
trilateral
framework
which
is
critical
to
protecting
north
american
supply
chains
that
support
millions
of
american
jobs
the
administration
as
well
as
officials
from
canada
and
mexico
should
be
applauded
for
months
of
hard
work
aimed
at
modernizing
nafta
for
the
century
a
goal
retailers
have
shared
from
the
geoff
freeman
president
and
ceo
the
grocery
manufacturers
association
gma
consumers
rely
on
the
ingredients
and
affordable
products
made
possible
through
trade
with
our
closest
neighbours
this
trade
has
quadrupled
since
nafta
went
into
effect
more
than
two
decades
ago
totalling
nearly
billion
in
canada
and
mexico
buy
about
half
of
all
processed
product
exports
and
this
agreement
will
expand
that
success

and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
international
dairy
foods
association
a
washington
group
that
represents
dairy
processors
having
this
agreement
be
trilateral
is
very
important
we
are
pleased
to
see
the
negotiators
preserved
access
with
our
number
one
customer
mexico
for
canada
our
priorities
included
increased
market
access
and
my
understanding
is
we
did
get
that
we
are
pleased
with
the
negotiators
and
are
pleased
with
the
priority
they
placed
on
the
dairy
edward
hamberger
chief
the
association
of
american
railroads
the
free
flow
of
goods
across
north
america
without
burdensome
tariffs
is
a
net
positive
for
workers
bedrock
industries
and
the
nothing
but
good
news
here
for
the
us
dairy
industry
class
milk
pricing
in
canada
caused
problems
for
us
manufacturers
in
two
different
ways
first
it
stopped
the
flow
of
milk
a
concentrated
skim
solids
ingredient
that
was
used
to
boost
protein
content
in
cheese
and
yogurt
made
in
canada
second
the
pricing
system
allowed
for
canada
to
be
competitive
to
export
their
excess
skim
milk
powder
taking
away
market
share
from
the
us
eliminating
the
canadian
class
pricing
system
could
open
these
markets
back
up
to
us
processors
lastly
any
further
opening
of
the
canadian
market
to
general
imports
is
helpful
to
the
us
dairy
industry
while
exact
details
of
the
agreement
between
canada
and
the
united
states
have
yet
to
be
released
there
is
nothing
at
the
core
of
the
agreement
that
looks
bearish
to
the
us
dairy
industry
and
should
lead
to
a
boost
in
export
demand
for
us
dairy

an

brokerage
and
advisory
firm
it
opens
up
the
trade
for
a
lot
of
different
agricultural
products
i
don
t
know
if
the
usmca
was
a
surprise
it
was
definitely
a
positive
for
all
the
ag
markets
for
the
psychology
of
the
markets
pushing
forward
to
the
eu
and
japan
talks
those
are
probably
as
dominant
for
the
market
as
looking
at
the
price
action
last
week
the
canadian
dollar
outperformed
so
there
may
have
been
some
inkling
in
the
markets
that
with
this
sort
of
deadline
that
we
had
at
the
end
of
september
that
we
could
get
something
or
should
get
something
but
we
have
run
into
a
lot
of
those
soft
deadlines
before
and
nothing
of
consequence
has
happened
i
don
t
know
that
anyone
was
overly
convinced
that
we
would
get
something
necessarily
this
weekend
but
i
think
most
people
viewed
a
trade
arrangement
would
be
bound
at
some
point
the
good
news
is
that
the
risk
of
bad
news
has
been
removed
i
don
t
think
there
s
anything
here
that
really
changes
the
medium
term
outlook
for
the
canadian
dollar
or
the
canadian
economy
it
s
just
removed

the
most
significant
thing
about
this
new
deal
is
that
they
changed
the
name
reading
it
it
really
is
tweaks
to
nafta
but
at
least
some
of
them
in
a
positive
direction
from
the
economic
perspective
it
really
is
very
small
changes
to
the
underlying
framework
of
north
american
trade
but
that
s
a
positive
there
s
only
downside
to
a
trade
war
to
the
extent
we
avoided
a
trade
war
in
this
hemisphere
at
least
that
is
a
positive
the
fact
that
having
made
a
very
big
deal
about
nafta
during
the
elections
but
then
agreed
to
a
deal
which
only
changes
small
parts
of
it
does
say
something
about
the
potential
end
game
for
trade
talks
with
china
there
is
a
limit
to
how
much
china
will
compromise
in
the
end
a
limit
to
how
much
we
will
need
them
to
compromise
in
the
end
after
all
the
trade
deficit
is
primarily
caused
by
a
dollar
and
a
big
obviously
this
is
a
positive
step
forward
it
s
one
more
box
to
tick
overall
markets
and
investors
are
very
much
focussed
on
economic
policy
and
the
upcoming
earnings
season
and
ignoring
everything
coming
out
of
washington
but
given
that
last
week
it
was
looking
to
be
more
of
a
deal
as
opposed
to
a
trilateral
deal
it
s
a
positive
development
it
shows
investors
that
in
spite
of
an
unconventional
approach

hard
tactics

there
is
a
pretty
significant
tone
following
the
new
nafta
agreement
however
an
eventual
agreement
was
priced
in
or
at
least
a
scenario
was
priced
in
the
market
was
more
focussed
on
the
risk
of
a
trade
war
with
china
than
any
other
area
and
the
market
has
been
positioned
accordingly
and
even
with
china
the
market
has
discounted
what
impact
any
trade
negotiations
will
have
on
the
fundamentals
of
the
economy
this
is
a
positive
and
you
ve
seen
risk
assets
respond
and
you
ve
seen
treasuries
respond
a
bit
but
fundamentals
are
so
strong
right
now
that
the

these
negotiations

anything
positive
relating

always
buoyed

it
s
not

to
see
a
bounce
generally
those
things
are
relatively
short
lived

the
economics
in
the

are
very
strong

about
