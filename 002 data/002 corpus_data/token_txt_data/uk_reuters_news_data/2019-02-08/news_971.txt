a
beluga
whale
spotted
in
london
s
river
thames
surfaced
again
on
wednesday
near
the
british
capital
hundreds
of
miles
from
its
normal
arctic
habitat
the
white
cetacean
which
feeds
on
fish
squid
and
crabs
was
first
spotted
on
tuesday
and
surfaced
near
gravesend
kent
on
the
southern
side
of
the
estuary
television
footage
showed
we
are
surprised
and
a
little
saddened
that
it
has
resurfaced
again
we
had
hoped
it
had
gone
out
to
deeper
waters
and
gone
out
to
where
it
should
be
said
lucy
babey
head
of
science
and
conservation
at
the
orca
charity
the
last
sighting
of
beluga
whales
in
uk
waters
was
in
when
they
were
spotted
off
northeastern
england
near
the
northumberland
coastline
but
they
left
shortly
afterwards
belugas
which
can
grow
up
to
metres
feet
long
spend
most
of
their
time
off
the
coasts
of
alaska
canada
and
russia
though
they
often
travel
great
distances
in
search
of
food
babey
said
it
was
unclear
why
this
one
had
lost
its
way
and
come
into
the
thames
though
it
would
be
unlikely
to
have
lost
its
way
due
to
storms
or
because
it
was
following
prey
the
most
likely
scenario
which
we
are
not
going
to
know
until
we
can
investigate
this
animal
more
is
that
there
is
an
impairment
to
its
navigation
system
babey
said
if
that
navigation
system
is
impaired
or
there
is
a
lot
of
disturbance
to
its
environment
whether
from
natural
causes
or
noise
the
animal
will
not
be
able
to
navigate
correctly
and
can
go
off
the
whale
spotted
in
the
thames
was
clearly
a
mature
beluga
whale
and
possibly
a
female
or
a
younger
whale
due
to
its
size
babey
said
it
is
a
beluga
i
can
confirm
that
she
added
in
a
northern
whale
died
after
stranding
itself
in
the
thames
