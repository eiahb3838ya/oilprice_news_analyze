eased
slightly
on
monday
but
outperformed
europe
as
relative
calm

after
last
week
s
tumult
and
prime
minister
theresa
may
continued
to
fight
for
support
for
her
brexit
deal
the
ftse
fell
percent
giving
up
opening
gains
but
strength
in
the
financial
and
mining
sectors
helped
the
index
outperform
a
percent

in

stoxx
things
are
a
bit
calmer
and
there
s
not
been
anything
particularly
exciting
bearing
in
mind
that
end
of
last

a
rout
in

uk
investors
focussed
on
politics
as
may
vowed
to
fight
on
to
gather
support
for
her
draft
european
union
divorce
deal
as
dissenters
in
her
own
party
scrambled
to
trigger
a
leadership
challenge
may
might
have
overcome
the
issue
of
no
confidence
vote
and
that
adds
an
element
of
certainty
and
may
mean
we
re
looking
at
a
deal
rather
than
a
no
deal
and
businesses
like
certainty

recovered
some
of
the
ground
lost
during
last
week
s
with
lloyds
bank
up
percent
and
kingfisher
up
percent
miners
also
provided
support
adding
percent
but
the
gains
were
more
than
offset
by
a
slump
in
energy
shares
as
the
session
drew
to
a
close
as
several
investors
remained
cautious
over
the
outlook
for
brexit
some
of
the

the

bounced
so
there
s
no
big

relief
if
you
look

happening
