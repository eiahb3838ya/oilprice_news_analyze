jordan
said
on
saturday
it
regretted
a
decision
to
halt
funding
to
a
united
nations
agency
for
palestinian
refugees
saying
it
would
only
fuel
radicalism
and
harm
prospects
for
middle
east
peace
foreign
minster
ayman
safadi
told
reuters
his
country
which
hosts
more
than
million
of
the
over
million
registered
refugees
whom
the
agency
supports
would
continue
to
rally
donor
support
to
ease
the
acute
financial
crunch
faced
by
the
agency
the
announced
on
friday
it
would
no
longer
support
the
united
nations
relief
and
works
agency
unrwa
earlier
this
year
the
united
states
long
its
biggest
donor
had
slashed
funding
disruption
of
unrwa
services
will
have
extremely
dangerous
humanitarian
political
and
security
implications
for
refugees
and
for
the
whole
region
safadi
said
it
will
only
consolidate
an
environment
of
despair
that
would
ultimately
create
fertile
grounds
for
further
tension
politically
it
will
also
further
hurt
the
credibility
of
peacemaking
safadi
said
a
meeting
on
in
new
york
in
the
united
nations
which
the
kingdom
was
with
japan
the
european
union
sweden
and
turkey
would
seek
to
rally
political
and
financial
support
for
the
agency
we
will
do
everything
possible
to
ensure
that
unrwa
gets
the
funds
it
needs
to
continue
offering
its
services
to
palestinian
refugees
safadi
added
staunch
ally
jordan
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
conflict
with
many
of
its
citizens
refugees
or
descendants
of
the
roughly
palestinians
who
were
driven
out
of
their
homes
or
fled
the
fighting
in
the
war
that
led
to
israel
s
creation
diplomats
say
the
decision
has
stirred
fears
of
a
new
middle
east
policy
under
president
donald
trump
s
administration
that
seeks
to
dilute
and
eventually
strike
out
the
right
of
return
for
millions
of
palestinian
refugees
safadi
said
the
international
community
s
support
for
the
agency
was
inseparable
from
future
talks
on
the
fate
of
refugees
among
the
most
sensitive
issues
in
the
conflict
the
issue
was
agreed
to
be
among
final
status
talks
that
were
stalled
in
ultimately
over
whether
israel
would
make
territorial
concessions
in
return
for
a
lasting
peace
deal
with
the
arabs
the
status
of
refugees
is
not
determined
by
any
one
single
country
it
is
determined
under
international
law
and
as
such
no
country
can
take
away
that
status
