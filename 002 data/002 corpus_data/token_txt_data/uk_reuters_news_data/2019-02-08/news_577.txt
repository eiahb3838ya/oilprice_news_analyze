north korea tests new 'tactical' weapon, releases u.s. prisoner
reuters
north
korea
s
leader
witnessed
the
test
of
a
newly
developed
weapon
the
country
s
state
media
reported
on
friday
while
pyongyang
also
released
a
prisoner
sending
conflicting
signals
at
a
time
of
sensitive
negotiations
kim
jong
un
s
visit
to
the
test
site
of
what
north
korea
s
state
media
called
a
tactical
weapon
that
could
protect
north
korea
like
a
steel
wall
threatened
to
sour
the
diplomatic
atmosphere
at
a
time
when
negotiations
between
north
korea
and
the
united
states
appear
to
have
stalled
however
the
state
department
sought
to
play
down
the
development
suggesting
it
would
not
derail
efforts
to
persuade
north
korea
to
give
up
a
nuclear
weapons
programme
that
has
the
potential
to
threaten
the
united
states
we
remain
confident
that
the
promises
made
by
president
trump
and
chairman
kim
will
be
fulfilled
a
spokesman
for
the
state
department
said
at
an
unprecedented
summit
in
june
president
donald
trump
and
kim
in
singapore
agreed
to
work
toward
denuclearisation
and
peace
on
the
korean
peninsula
and
establish
new
relations
but
the
agreement
was
short
on
specifics
and
negotiations
have
made
little
headway
since
north
korea
s
kcna
news
agency
did
not
identify
the
weapon
tested
but
called
the
test
a
success
the
only
picture
released
by
state
media
showed
kim
standing
on
a
beach
surrounded
by
officials
in
military
uniforms
with
no
weapons
visible
the
description
of
the
weapon
as
tactical
appeared
to
rule
out
larger
strategic
weapons
such
as
a
ballistic
missile
or
a
nuclear
bomb
which
north
korea
demonstrated
until
last
year
raising
fears
of
a
new
korean
war
but
testing
of
any
new
weapon
threatens
to
raise
tensions
with
washington
which
has
upset
pyongyang
by
repeatedly
stressing
that
international
sanctions
must
remain
in
place
until
north
korea
gives
up
its
nuclear
weapons
a
source
familiar
with
assessments
said
the
united
states
was
still
evaluating
the
test
but
was
not
particularly
alarmed
the
source
said
the
announcement
was
low
key
by
north
korean
standards
suggesting
that
kim
did
not
want
to
stir
things
up
too
much
even
while
delivering
a
warning
in
an
apparently
conciliatory
gesture
north
korea
also
announced
on
friday
it
was
releasing
an
american
citizen
detained
since
october
after
he
illegally
entered
north
korea
from
china
pyongyang
identified
the
man
as
bruce
byron
lowrance
the
state
department
declined
to
identify
the
citizen
and
did
not
provide
details
about
him
but
in
a
statement
on
friday
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
who
has
led
the
negotiating
effort
with
north
korea
thanked
north
korea
and
sweden
for
cooperating
to
secure
the
release
north
korea
has
held
previous
american
detainees
for
longer
and
washington
has
accused
pyongyang
of
using
them
as
bargaining
chips
adam
mount
of
the
federation
of
american
scientists
saw
the
test
announcement
as
a
warning
to
washington
they
re
trying
to
signal
that
they
are
willing
to
walk
away
from
talks
and
restart
weapons
testing
he
said
it
is
the
most
explicit
in
a
series
of
escalating
statements
designed
to
send
this
kim
this
year
declared
his
nuclear
force
complete
and
said
he
would
focus
on
economic
development
but
north
korea
has
increasingly
expressed
frustration
at
washington
s
refusal
to
ease
sanctions
and
recently
threatened
to
restart
development
of
its
nuclear
weapons
if
more
concessions
were
not
made
a
meeting
in
new
york
planned
this
month
between
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
and
north
korea
s
kim
yong
chol
a
senior
aide
to
kim
was
postponed
however
vice
president
mike
pence
on
thursday
said
trump
planned
to
meet
kim
again
in
and
will
push
for
a
concrete
plan
outlining
pyongyang
s
moves
to
end
its
arms
programs
choi
kang
of
seoul
s
asan
institute
for
policy
studies
said
friday
s
announcement
was
more
likely
aimed
at
reassuring
the
north
korean
military
rather
than
trying
to
torpedo
diplomatic
talks
north
korea
is
trying
to
show
its
soldiers
that
they
are
becoming
and
keeping
a
certain
level
of
military
capability
while
trying
to
eliminate
dissatisfaction
and
worries
inside
its
military
he
said
the
test
may
also
have
been
a
response
to
recent
military
drills
by
the
united
states
and
south
korea
which
pyongyang
said
violated
recent
pacts
to
halt
all
hostile
said

the

and

forum
kim
said
the
weapons
system
tested
was
one
that
his
father
kim
jong
il
had
taken
a
special
interest
in
during
his
life
personally
leading
its
development
international
weapons
experts
noted
the
officials
with
kim
included
a
leader
of
north
korea

artillery
corps
kim
s
last
publicized
military
inspection
was
the
launch
of
the
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
a
year
ago
though
he
engaged
in
at
least
eight
other
military
related
activities
this
year
south
korea
s
unification
ministry
said
while
it
has
conducted
no
nuclear
or
missile
tests
since
last
year
north
korea
has
continued
to
showcase
its
conventional
military
capabilities

at
a
large
military
parade
in
its
capital
