eu says britain must hold european elections if no brexit before july 2
brussels
reuters
the
european
commission
indicated
on
friday
that
britons
would
need
to
choose
their
representatives
to
the
next
european
parliament
if
the
country
were
to
stay
in
the
european
union
beyond
the
first
sitting
of
the
new
assembly
on
july
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
eu
at
midnight
of
march
but
the
british
parliament
has
rejected
a
withdrawal
agreement
prime
minister
theresa
may
negotiated
with
the
eu
expectations
are
rising
that
london
will
need
to
ask
for
more
time
to
agree
its
own
position
on
the
terms
of
its
exit
the
prospect
of
an
extension
sparked
a
debate
over
whether
britain
would
need
to
take
part
in
european
parliamentary
elections
to
avoid
legal
challenges
to
the
institution
s
work
if
britain
were
not
represented
even
though
still
formally
a
member
of
the
eu
at
the
time
when
it
starts
operating
commission
spokesman
margaritis
schinas
told
a
regular
news
briefing
that
the
eu
executive
arm
had
not
received
any
request
from
london
for
an
extension
of
the
march
deadline
to
leave
the
eu
and
therefore
such
a
discussion
was
theoretical
we
as
the
guardian
of
eu
treaties
suggest
caution
with
any
suggestion
that
the
right
of
eu
citizens
to
vote
in
the
european
parliament
elections
according
to
the
rules
that
are
applicable
could
be
called
into
question
schinas
said
we
have
a
legally
composed
european
parliament
which
requires
directly
elected
meps
from
all
member
states
at
the
latest
on
the
first
day
of
the
new
term
of
the
new
parliament
which
this
time
is
the
second
of
july
he
said
this
is
the
legal
situation
as
guardians
of
the
treaty
we
would
prefer
to
stay
within
the
applicable
legal
order
he
said
but
the
legal
services
of
the
european
parliament
itself
have
a
different
view
in
a
legal
opinion
from
seen
by
reuters
european
parliament
lawyers
said
britain
would
not
have
to
elect
its
representatives
even
if
it
were
still
a
member
of
the
eu
the
legal
service
takes
the
view
that
the
european
council
could
validly
adopt
a
decision
containing
a
scenario
for
the
composition
of
parliament
without
seats
envisaged
for
the
uk
if
the
latter
had
not
formally
withdrawn
from
the
union
at
the
time
of
adoption
of
this
decision
the
legal
said
britain
had
a
treaty
obligation
to
organise
elections
to
the
european
parliament
if
it
were
still
a
member
in
may
the
lawyers
but
if
it
decided
not
to
do
that
the
legality
of
the
next
european
parliament
could
not
be
questioned
they
said
the
legal
service
takes
the
view
that
the
possibility
for
the
european
parliament
to
be
validly
constituted
following
the
elections
would
not
be
affected
by
a
potential
failure
of
by
the
uk
to
organise
elections
