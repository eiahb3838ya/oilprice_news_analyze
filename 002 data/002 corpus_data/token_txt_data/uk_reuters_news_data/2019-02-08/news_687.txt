britain's big brexit vote: will parliament back pm may?
london
reuters
if
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
is
able
to
strike
a
brexit
deal
with
the
european
union
in
the
coming
days
or
weeks
she
will
face
a
crucial
vote
in
parliament
when
she
asks
lawmakers
to
approve
it
how
will
the
vote
in
parliament
work
if
a
deal
is
agreed
may
has
to
publish
in
parliament
a
copy
of
the
withdrawal
agreement
and
an
outline
agreement
of
britain
s
future
relationship
with
the
eu
ministers
must
then
arrange
a
debate
in
the
directly
elected
lower
house
of
parliament
this
will
culminate
in
a
vote
to
determine
whether
parliament
has
approved
the
deal
this
is
the
big
vote
the
government
can
move
very
quickly
to
organise
the
vote
once
a
deal
is
reached
but
any
debate
is
expected
to
last
several
days
the
format
of
the
debate
and
vote
is
yet
to
be
decided
and
currently
subject
to
fierce
disagreement
this
is
because
it
could
have
a
crucial
role
in
determining
whether
the
government
wins
the
vote
ministers
argue
that
any
decision
by
parliament
must
be
unambiguous
in
endorsing
the
deal
as
it
is
presented
by
the
government
if
not
they
say
the
vote
might
not
meet
the
legal
criteria
necessary
for
ratification
of
the
withdrawal
agreement
but
opponents
of
may
s
strategy
instead
want
to
use
the
debate
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
majority
support
for
an
alternative
exit
strategy
such
as
a
second
referendum
or
remaining
inside
the
eu
s
customs
union
the
way
in
which
they
are
able
to
do
this
will
depend
on
the
format
there
could
be
multiple
votes
which
although
not
legally
binding
would
be
politically
hard
to
ignore
if
they
show
support
for
an
alternative
exit
arrangement
a
final
decision
on
the
format
will
be
made
closer
to
the
time
by
parliamentary
officials
based
on
recommendations
from
lawmakers
legislation
only
stipulates
ministers
should
try
to
hold
a
debate
before
the
european
parliament
has
its
own
vote
the
unelected
upper
house
of
parliament
the
house
of
lords
will
also
debate
the
deal
but
will
only
be
asked
to
take
note
of
it
the
lords
will
not
get
a
straight
approve
or
reject
vote
and
will
not
have
the
power
to
block
the
deal
the
legislation
defining
the
procedure
for
parliamentary
approval
does
not
specify
how
quickly
after
a
deal
is
announced
the
vote
will
happen
lawmakers
will
be
voting
on
whether
to
approve
a
package
consisting
of
the
withdrawal
agreement
a
legal
text
setting
out
issues
such
as
citizens
rights
the
financial
settlement
a
backstop
for
the
irish
border
and
the
terms
of
an
implementation
period
designed
to
smooth
the
exit
process
the
future
relationship
framework
a
document
defining
how
britain
and
the
eu
will
work
together
in
the
long
term
on
issues
such
as
trade
and
security
these
two
documents
define
the
deal
may
and
her
team
have
been
negotiating
with
the
european
commission
since
june
there
are
elected
lawmakers
in
britain
s
house
of
commons
excluding
members
such
as
the
speaker
and
others
who
never
take
up
their
seats
around
votes
are
needed
to
be
certain
of
winning
a
vote
the
actual
number
needed
for
victory
depends
on
abstentions
and
absences
on
the
day
the
vote
is
decided
by
a
simple
majority
whichever
side
has
more
votes
wins
at
the
end
of
the
debate
the
speaker
will
typically
ask
for
those
in
favour
of
the
motion
to
shout
aye
and
then
those
against
to
say
no
as
long
as
some
lawmakers
shout
no
the
speaker
will
call
for
a
formal
vote
known
as
a
division
votes
are
registered
by
lawmakers
walking
through
different
doorways
out
of
sight
of
television
cameras
and
onlookers
once
the
headcount
is
complete
which
can
take
up
to
minutes
lawmakers
return
to
the
debating
chamber
four
appointed
tellers
will
assemble
in
front
of
the
speaker
and
one
will
read
the
result
out
loud
the
ruling
conservative
party
has
lawmakers
it
governs
with
a
working
majority
of
thanks
to
a
deal
with
the
lawmakers
of
the
northern
irish
democratic
unionist
party
dup
but
may
s
party
is
not
united
behind
her
current
plan
eurosceptics
think
it
leaves
britain
too
tied
to
eu
rules
and
lawmakers
say
the
ties
are
not
close
enough
both
groups
are
potentially
large
enough
to
inflict
defeat
the
support
of
the
dup
lawmakers
is
dependent
on
the
solution
agreed
on
the
irish
border
they
have
said
they
will
not
support
any
deal
that
leaves
northern
ireland
subject
to
different
rules
to
the
rest
of
the
country
the
opposition
labour
party
has
lawmakers
led
by
jeremy
corbyn
the
party
has
pledged
to
vote
down
any
deal
that
does
not
meet
its
criteria
the
plans
currently
under
discussion
are
unlikely
to
do
this
so
most
labour
lawmakers
can
be
expected
to
vote
against
may
however
some
who
disagree
with
corbyn
s
stance
could
rebel
and
vote
with
the
government
in
order
to
avoid
the
risk
of
leaving
without
a
deal
media
reports
have
said
may
is
courting
these
labour
moderates
the
scottish
national
party
s
lawmakers
are
expected
to
vote
against
the
government
deal
as
are
the
liberal
democrats
no
although
the
vote
is
the
focal
point
for
resistance
to
the
deal
the
government
is
also
required
to
pass
separate
legislation
to
implement
the
withdrawal
agreement
and
complete
the
ratification
process
this
legislation
will
be
known
as
the
eu
withdrawal
agreement
bill
it
will
be
subject
to
full
scrutiny
in
parliament
involving
multiple
rounds
of
possible
amending
and
voting
it
has
to
be
passed
before
march
this
process
is
unlikely
to
be
used
to
unpick
the
deal
as
the
legislation
will
be
implementing
what
has
already
been
approved
by
parliament
however
if
parliament
feels
as
if
may
has
ignored
its
wishes
and
is
forcing
the
deal
through
it
could
use
the
bill
to
stall
the
exit
process
this
would
be
a
politically
explosive
outcome
that
could
topple
may
and
her
government
there
are
legislative
guidelines
on
what
happens
next
but
they
could
be
overtaken
by
events
by
law
if
the
government
motion
is
rejected
ministers
have
days
to
set
out
in
a
statement
how
they
intend
to
proceed
the
government
has
said
that
if
their
deal
is
rejected
britain
will
leave
the
eu
without
a
deal
it
then
has
to
call
a
fresh
debate
in
parliament
that
could
give
lawmakers
another
chance
to
set
out
amendments
effectively
giving
parliament
a
vote
on
an
alternative
path
these
amendments
would
not
be
binding
but
if
approved
may
would
again
find
them
hard
to
ignore
however
it
is
also
technically
possible
that
the
government
could
call
a
second
vote
in
the
commons
and
ask
lawmakers
for
their
approval
again
on
either
the
same
or
amended
terms
