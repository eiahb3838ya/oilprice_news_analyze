for emerging market investors, u.s. sanctions on russia will not pack same punch
york
reuters
a
threat
to
impose
sanctions
on
russian
sovereign
debt
transactions
is
one
of
the
biggest
financial
weapons
that
the
can
deploy
against
the
kremlin
but
moscow
s
slide
down
the
investment
league
table
in
recent
years
means
the
move
will
not
pack
the
punch
it
once
would
have
a
bipartisan
group
of
senators
introduced
legislation
on
thursday
aimed
at
penalising
russia
for
interference
in
recent
elections
something
the
kremlin
strongly
denies
as
well
as
for
its
annexation
of
crimea
and
actions
in
syria
the
sanctions
would
need
to
be
passed
by
the
full
house
and
receive
president
donald
trump
s
signature
but
if
they
do
become
a
reality
it
would
mark
a
new
low
in
relations
between
the
former
cold
war
foes
they
would
also
hit
the
energy
sector
russian
uranium
imports
and
a
host
of
oligarchs
but
it
is
a
move
to
ban
purchases
of
any
new
russian
sovereign
debt
going
forward
that
has
raised
the
most
eyebrows
it
is
considered
one
of
washington
s
most
potent
tools
because
it
would
effectively
freeze
the
russian
government
out
of
international
borrowing
markets
creating
a
similar
scenario
to
that
faced
by
argentina
for
a
decade
until
following
a
default
and
a
court
ruling
against
it
the
measure
may
create
fewer
problems
for
russia
though
than
were
faced
by
argentina
given
russia
has
one
of
the
lowest
debt
levels
in
the
world
and
nearly
half
a
trillion
dollars
in
reserves
thanks
to
huge
oil
and
gas
export
revenues
russia
is
also
used
to
during
difficult
times
and
has
sharply
cut
back
on
issuing
dollar
debt
after
the
ukraine
crisis
in
addition
russia
features
less
in
emerging
market
investors
portfolios
than
it
did
even
five
years
ago
russia
is
still
an
overweight
for
most
people
at
the
moment
but
this
isn
t
going
to
kill
the
fund
industry
by
any
means
said
peter
kisler
an
emerging
market
debt
manager
at
north
asset
management
as
overseas
borrowing
by
the
russian
government
and
companies
has
shrunk
so
has
the
country
s
weighting
on
bond
indexes
that
are
used
by
investors
for
instance
russia
comprises
just
percent
of
jpmorgan
s
embi
global
hard
currency
sovereign
bond
index
compared
to
percent
in

indexes

on
the
cembi
corporate
debt
index
it
amounts
to
percent
down
from
percent
years
ago
so
in
theory
at
least
it
would
be
relatively
easy
for
investors
to
bypass
russia
in
portfolios
even
if
its
debt
is
a
current
favourite
due
to
scarcity
value
and
the
country
s
payment
credentials
mike
cirami
of
global
income
at
eaton
vance
in
boston
said
the
weighting
of
russian
debt
was
now
small
enough
and
the
premium
it
offers
was
low
enough
for
investors
to
easily
be
able
to
jettison
it
if
needed
if
all
you
were
was
an
embi
investor
you
could
forget
that
russia
exists
in
my
opinion
and
you
could
manage
just
fine
and
not
have
any
problems
outperforming
the
benchmark
embi
global
diversified
he
said
russia
has
a
higher
percent
weight
in
the
index
for
emerging
local
currency
bonds
the
that
s
up
from
percent
in
but
off
the
percent
it
hit
during
the
oil
boom

while

as

it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
sanctions
will
be
deployed
as
many
reckon
the
treasury
will
hold
off
from
such
aggressive
measures
i
would
say
that
our
base
case
is
that
russian
sovereign
would
be
a
sanction
whereas
they
are
likely
to
use
the
corporate
sector
to
target
individuals
and
companies
from
a
sanctions
perspective
said
shamaila
khan
head
of
emerging
markets
fixed
income
at
alliancebernstein
in
new
york
the
fact
is
once
you
embark
on
a
sanctions
path
you
just
don
t
know
where
it
ends
added
khan
who
said
unpredictability
could
weigh
on
russian
asset
prices
generally
the
developments
nonetheless
focus
attention
on
how
russian
markets
have
stagnated
relative
to
those
in
other
developing
economies
its
importance
over
the
last
decade
has
declined
for
bond
as
well
as
equity
investors
russia
s
weighting
on
msci
s
emerging
equity
index
a
benchmark
for
almost
trillion
in
cash
has
dwindled
to
percent
from
over
percent
in
china
s
weight
meanwhile
has
almost
doubled
in
that
period
to
nearly
percent
that
reflects
russia
s
own
stagnation
says
renaissance
capital
s
global
economist
charles
robertson
he
notes
the
three
biggest
companies
in
russia
s
equity
index
are
the
same
ones
as
back
in
gazprom
sberbank
and
rosneft
all
are
at
one
point
we
were
asking
whether
russia
s
gdp
was
going
to
catch
up
with
california
s
said
robertson
that
is
certainly
not
going
to
happen
and
unless
there
is
a
in
the
russian
political
order
and
economy
these
companies
can
expect
to
hang
on
to
their
top
positions
he
predicted
contrast
this
with
the
united
states
where
the
top
rankings
change
every
decade
or
two
china
is
replicating
that
dynamic
with
technology
giants
such
as
tencent
and
baidu
taking
over
from
previous
companies
that
topped
the
rankings
including
oil
firms
and
banks
within
msci
s
emerging
equity
index
too
technology
firms
have
displaced
commodity
producers
as
the
biggest
firms
russia
s
gazprom
was
the
biggest
company
in
the
index
back
in
today
it
does
not
make
the
