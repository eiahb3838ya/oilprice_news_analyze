eu rules out reworking brexit deal, prepares for no-deal -tusk
brussels
reuters
eu
leaders
will
not
renegotiate
britain
s
brexit
deal
including
the
irish
border
backstop
their
chairman
donald
tusk
said
on
monday
after
prime
minister
theresa
may
put
off
a
parliamentary
vote
on
a
package
that
was
facing
heavy
defeat
eu
officials
said
european
council
president
tusk
could
meet
may
as
early
as
tuesday
to
prepare
talks
on
brexit
during
a
regular
brussels
summit
which
may
will
attend
on
thursday
and
friday
tusk
said
he
had
scheduled
a
meeting
of
the
other
leaders
on
brexit
to
be
held
at
some
point
during
the
summit
we
will
not
renegotiate
the
deal
including
the
backstop
he
said
on
twitter
after
may
said
she
would
go
back
to
european
neighbours
to
seek
new
reassurances
about
the
insurance
clause
which
would
bind
britain
into
a
customs
union
with
the
eu
in
order
to
avoid
a
hard
eu
border
for
troubled
northern
ireland
may
s
domestic
critics
want
a
time
limit
on
the
backstop
but
dublin
and
its
eu
allies
insist
that
it
must
be
able
to
be
used
until
some
better
way
is
found
to
avoid
customs
checks
on
the
land
border
while
letting
britain
escape
eu
rules
eu
officials
said
it
was
almost
inconceivable
that
leaders
would
agree
to
reopen
the
withdrawal
treaty
they
agreed
with
may
two
weeks
ago
which
includes
the
backstop
they
might
agree
to
tweak
the
accompanying
political
declaration
on
future
relations
though
even
that
was
doubtful
finally
they
could
issue
a
new
declaration
of
intent
to
try
and
help
may
tusk
said
only
we
are
ready
to
discuss
how
to
facilitate
uk
but
he
also
warned
that
the
eu
would
forge
ahead
with
preparing
for
there
being
no
deal
at
all
as
it
faces
a
britain
that
seems
incapable
of
forging
a
majority
opinion
on
what
kind
of
brexit
it
wants
or
even
if
it
wants
to
leave
at
all
as
time
is
running
out
we
will
also
discuss
our
preparedness
for
a
scenario
tusk
said
referring
to
the
fact
that
britain
will
be
out
of
the
bloc
on
march
according
to
a
treaty
timetable
with
or
without
a
deal
