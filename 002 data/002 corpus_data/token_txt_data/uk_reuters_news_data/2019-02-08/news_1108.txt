hans-georg maassen- the spy who went out into the heat

spies
usually
operate
in
the
shadows
maassen
chief
of
germany
s
domestic
spy
agency
has
done
just
the
opposite
and
taken
in
a
heated
debate
about
the
that
is
shaking
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
government
to
its
core
in
comments
to
friday
s
edition
of
daily
bild
maassen
said
he
was
sceptical
about
reports
that
migrants
had
been
hounded
in
the
city
of
chemnitz
after
the
fatal
stabbing
of
a
german
man
there
for
which
two
asylum
seekers
were
arrested
the
violence
in
the
eastern
city
has
shaken
germany
deeply
but
maassen
said
his
bfv
domestic
intelligence
agency
had
no
reliable
information
about
such
hunts
taking
place
and
that
a
video
circulating
showing
that
happening
could
have
been
faked
those
comments
put
him
at
odds
with
merkel
who
said
images
from
chemnitz
very
clearly
showed
hate
she
has
also
accused
the
alternative
for
germany
afd
party
of
using
violent
protests
over
the
stabbing
to
stir
up
ethnic
tension
the
upshot
is
that
senior
politicians
are
calling
for
maassen
to
go
he
will
likely
have
to
explain
himself
to
a
parliamentary
committee
this
week
his
own
stance
towards
the
is
also
being
questioned
will
the
afd
soon
have
a
new
hero
the
bild
am
sonntag
newspaper
asked
in
a
headline
next
to
a
picture
of
maassen
whose
face
was
plastered
across
german
weekend
newspapers
and
television
bulletins
questions
have
been
raised
before
about
how
aggressively
maassen
has
taken
on
the
including
the
afd
which
he
has
resisted
putting
under
surveillance
a
former
leader
of
the
afd
s
youth
wing
franziska
schreiber
wrote
in
her
book
published
this
year
inside
afd
the
report
of
a
that
maassen
had
advised
leader
frauke
petry
on
how
the
party
could
avoid
being
put
under
surveillance
by
his
office
he
has
denied
giving
such
counsel
a
trained
lawyer
who
forged
his
career
in
the
interior
ministry
maassen
has
generally
stayed
out
of
the
spotlight
during
his
six
years
in
charge
of
the
bfv
though
he
has
clashed
with
other
more
circumspect
government
officials
for
calling
out
russia
as
the
likely
culprit
behind
cyber
attacks
on
germany
in
a
interview
with
reuters
maassen
said
extremists
in
germany
were
increasingly
ready
to
commit
violent
acts
a
risk
he
has
since
flagged
again
on
friday
maassen
s
bfv
intelligence
agency
said
it
would
make
further
checks
on
information
available
about
the
chemnitz
protests
as
there
are
always
fake
news
and
attempts
at
disinformation
on
social
media
checks
in
particular
with
regard
to
possible
hounding
of
migrants
by
extremists
will
continue
it
added
maassen
s
chemnitz
comments
have
aggravated
tensions
about
whether
politicians
and
the
authorities
are
being
too
complacent
in
the
face
of
rising
xenophobia
in
germany
where
many
thought
the
lessons
of
its
nazi
history
had
long
been
learned
the
remarks
have
also
split
berlin
s
political
class
and
fissures
over
immigration
in
merkel
s
grand
coalition
only
two
months
after
she
closed
a
painful
row
with
her
bavarian
sister
party
on
the
same
issue
interior
minister
horst
seehofer
of
the
bavarian
christian
social
union
csu
has
backed
maassen
alexander
gauland
of
the
afd
told
the
bild
am
sonntag
all
accusations
against
him
are
politically
but
malu
dreyer
a
senior
figure
in
the
social
democrats
junior
partner
in
merkel
s
coalition
said
he
had
created
uncertainty
and
destroyed
trust
in
the
state
so
i
do
not
think
he
is
still
the
right
man
for
this
position
