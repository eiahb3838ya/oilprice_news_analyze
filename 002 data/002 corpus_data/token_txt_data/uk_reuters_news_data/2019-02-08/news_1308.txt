as canada faces rising gun violence, tighter laws are a tough sell
toronto
reuters
rising
violence
in
canada
has
prompted
calls
for
the
federal
government
to
tighten
gun
laws
but
tougher
regulations
could
cause
a
political
backlash
in
a
country
where
million
people
are
licensed
to
own
a
firearm
in
people
were
murdered
with
a
gun
a
percent
increase
from
and
the
highest
rate
since
according
to
statistics
canada
one
of
the
deadliest
shooting
sprees
so
far
this
year
took
place
on
friday
when
four
people
were
shot
to
death
in
the
eastern
canadian
city
of
fredericton
weeks
earlier
a
gunman
opened
fire
on
a
bustling
danforth
avenue
in
toronto
killing
two
and
injuring
before
turning
the
gun
on
himself
in
fredericton
a
commonly
available
long
gun
such
as
a
rifle
or
shotgun
was
used
police
said
monday
adding
that
the
suspect
had
a
permit
to
use
it
in
toronto
the
gunman
used
a
handgun
it
is
not
clear
how
the
suspects
obtained
the
guns
canada
s
firearm
homicide
rate
of
per
people
is
about
times
greater
than
the
rate
in
the
united
kingdom
in
the
united
states
by
contrast
four
in
every
residents
are
killed
with
a
gun
or
almost
annually
canada
s
federal
government
introduced
gun
laws
earlier
this
year
that
would
require
retailer
and
beef
up
background
checks
the
government
is
open
to
considering
tougher
ones
after
toronto
called
for
a
ban
on
handguns
in
the
wake
of
the
danforth
shooting
said
bill
blair
the
minister
charged
with
tackling
gun
violence
we
re
prepared
to
look
at
any
measure
that
will
reduce
gun
violence
he
said
in
an
interview
adding
that
it
s
a
vast
country
and
the
way
in
which
guns
are
viewed
in
toronto
is
different
than
they
might
be
viewed
in
different
municipalities
or
the
bill
has
passed
second
reading
and
is
likely
to
pass
in
the
house
of
commons
where
liberals
hold
a
majority
but
may
face
headwinds
in
the
senate
but
any
move
by
the
liberal
government
to
more
heavily
regulate
ownership
could
prompt
a
backlash
by
the
opposition
conservatives
who
tend
to
do
well
in
rural
areas
where
hunting
is
popular
and
many
farmers
have
guns
canada
requires
residents
to
obtain
a
license
and
pass
a
safety
course
to
buy
a
gun
according
to
the
firearms
commissioner
more
than
million
people
have
such
licenses
in
a
country
of
million
there
is
a
national
registry
of
handguns
and
other
restricted
and
prohibited
guns
the
government
ended
a
similar
registry
for
long
guns
such
as
rifles
in
due
to
its
unpopularity
with
gun
owners
and
conservative
voters
under
proposed
legislation
retailers
would
keep
records
of
everyone
who
buys
a
long
gun
the
national
firearms
association
a
lobby
group
similar
to
the
national
rifle
association
but
with
less
clout
said
it
would
campaign
against
the
liberals
proposed
legislation
which
the
conservatives
said
treat
firearms
owners
as
criminals
because
of
the
background
checks
and
requirements
for
national
firearms
association
executive
vice
president
blair
hagen
said
his
group
which
has
members
has
been
in
touch
with
the
opposition
conservative
party
and
hopes
to
make
gun
control
an
election
issue
it
s
one
of
those
flashpoint
issues
he
said
monday
as
soon
as
you
touch
that
third
rail
you
re
setting
yourself
up
for
a
very
very
serious
political
the
liberals
criticized
the
former
conservative
government
s
move
to
scrap
a
registry
of
shotguns
and
rifles
but
the
issue
became
so
politically
toxic
that
the
party
has
promised
not
to
bring
it
back
that
is
not
part
of
our
plan
and
has
never
been
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
told
reporters
in
prince
edward
island
monday
the
registry
s
elimination
left
a
crucial
gap
when
it
comes
to
tracking
guns
says
wayne
rideout
a
former
royal
canadian
mounted
police
rcmp
officer
now
working
with
the
british
columbia
government
to
tackle
gun
crime
now
someone
with
a
license
buying
a
rifle
can
buy
guns
guns
guns
and
they
don
t
know
who
you
are
they
don
t
keep
a
record

said
