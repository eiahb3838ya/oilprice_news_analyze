million
hectares
this

the

has
stood
out
as
particularly
damaging
to

our
top
concern

the
seventh
largest
tourism
economy
connected
with
a
national

with
million
visitors
spending
an
estimated
million
in
according
to
the
national

service
while
beteta
had
no
official
estimates
for
how
much
wildfires
have
hurt

the
concern
is
that
potential

alarmed
by
the
blazes
are
canceling
trips
nearly
percent
of
visitors
to
california
go
to
a
national

they
re
still
fighting
local
businesses
around
the

this
summer
have
lost
millions
of
dollars
in
revenue
on
everything
from
hotel
rooms
to
trinkets
with
occupancy
rates
at
many
hotels
approaching
zero
said
rhonda
salisbury
chief
executive
of
the
yosemite
sierra
visitors
bureau
the
fire
has
triggered
road
closures
for
large
sections
of
the
park
including
the
yosemite
valley
which
has
been
cut
off
to
visitors
since
july
roads
are
money
and
without
the
roads
open
we
die

potential
profits

said
the
ferguson
fire
has
caused
two
deaths
and
scorched
about
acres
hectares
at
yosemite
which
is
about
miles
km
east
of
san
francisco
it
broke
out
on
july
when
local
businesses
usually
count
on
a
large
influx
of
families
with
children
on
summer
vacation
the
fire
has
also
hurt
businesses
such
as
skydive
yosemite
which
on
its
website
touts
amazing
views
of
yosemite
national
those
views
have
been
obscured
by
billowing
clouds
of
smoke
in
the
past
customers
could
see
half
dome
and
el
capitan
while
plummeting
to
earth
during
a
tandem
jump
said
skydive
yosemite
paul
wignall
but
smoke
blocked
those
views
the
company
had
cancellations
in
august
he
said
california
has
seen
the
worst
start
to
its
fire
season
in
a
decade
and
officials
from
the
national
aeronautics
and
space
administration
said
satellite
images
show
of
the
state
covered
in
smoke
smoke
from
fires
in
northern
california
have
even
reached
oregon
to
the
north
as
a
result
the
annual
oregon
shakespeare
festival
in
ashland
has
canceled
outdoor
shows
due
to
poor
air
quality
causing
a
loss
of
about
half
a
million
dollars
said
linea
gagliano
a
spokeswoman
for
the
oregon
tourism
commission
tourism
officials
in
some
other
parts
of
the
west
such
as
montana
idaho
and
utah
reported
minimal
damage
to
their
local
travel
and
leisure
industries
from
wildfires
but
the
local
tourism
economy
of
durango
southwest
colorado
is
still
feeling
the
effects
from
a
wildfire
when
the
fire
burned
parts
of
the
nearby
san
juan
national
forest
in
june
hotels
in
durango
saw
occupancy
rates
fall
below
percent
said
theresa
blake
graven
spokeswoman
for
the
durango
area
tourism
office
back
in
yosemite
park
spokesman
gediman
said
the
rare
interlude
of
quiet
at
the
peak
of
summer
has
given
wildlife
free
rein
in
the
valley
the
bears
are
walking
around
eating
apples
off
the
trees
and
the
berries
we
saw
a
mama
bear
and
her
cub
by
a
hotel
the
gray
foxes
are
out
so
for
me
it
s
been
fun
