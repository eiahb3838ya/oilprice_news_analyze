close

to
take
effect
after

michel

it
was
possible

in
time
for
a

of
all

leaders
in
brussels
on
though
a

was
also

after
his
latest
talks
with
barnier
britain
s
brexit
minister
dominic
raab
said
he
was
stubbornly
optimistic
and
as
confident
as
before
if
not
more
that
there
would
be
a
deal
the

said
they
made
progress
over
security

is
the
united

s
security

unresolved
issues
included
geographical
indication
labels
for
specialised
local
products
nuclear
cooperation
data
protection
and
the
role
of
the
eu

top
court
in
policing
the
agreement
after
weeks
of
warning
of
growing
risk
of
a
damaging
brexit
and
signalling
delay
was
expected
if
there
is
to
be
any
brexit
deal
the
eu
s
strategy
is
now
to
highlight
how
close
cooperation
with
britain
is
possible
after
brexit
to
make
london
more
willing
to
accept
divorce
terms
that
goes
specifically
for
the
sensitive
issue
of
the
land
border
between
ireland
and
northern
ireland
where
the
eu
wants
a
backstop
solution
in
case
of
no
deal
which
includes
terms
that
are
anathema
to
london
we
must
have
a
detailed
backstop
solution
which
is
legally
operational
in
the
withdrawal
agreement
barnier
said
this
backstop
is
critical
it
s
essential
to
concluding
these
negotiations
with
no
backstop
there
will
be
no
barnier
said
the
eu
and
uk
were
working
for
an
unprecedented
partnership
in
the
future
that
would
include
a
broad
agreement
as
well
as
sectoral
cooperation
deals
in
aviation
security
and
research
among
others
it
s
unprecedented
such
a
partnership
with
a
third
country
barnier
said
but
the
preliminary
condition
to
that
is
that
we
have
to
organise
an
orderly
withdrawal
of
the
uk
that
s
the
condition
of
the
unprecedented
partnership
