when
japanese
emperor
akihito
and
empress
michiko
stood
heads
bowed
at
a
seaside
cliff
on
saipan
years
after
a
bloody
world
war
two
battle
their
silent
prayers
conveyed
a
message
many
felt
resonated
louder
than
words
on
that
june
visit
one
of
many
trips
during
akihito
s
reign
the
royal
couple
paid
their
respects
at
memorials
not
only
for
japanese
but
also
american
and
korean
war
dead
i
think
the
emperor
felt
heartfelt
pain
and
mourning
for
those
who
died
and
that
we
must
not
forget
the
tragedy
of
the
war
and
should
convey
that
to
the
generations
who
have
not
experienced
it
shingo
haketa
former
grand
steward
of
the
imperial
household
agency
which
manages
the
monarch
s
affairs
told
reuters
in
an
exclusive
interview
haketa
and
a
other
associates
of
the
emperor
recounted
to
reuters
how
after
the
death
of
his
father
on
akihito
carved
out
an
active
role
as
symbol
of
peace
democracy
and
reconciliation
although
he
can
not
directly
influence
government
policy
akihito
has
created
a
broader
consciousness
of
japan
s
wartime
past
experts
say
that
is
a
sharp
departure
from
the
legacy
of
his
father
hirohito
once
revered
as
a
living
god
in
whose
name
japan
fought
world
war
two
hirohito
s
comments
about
the
conflict
were
vague
after
japan
s
defeat
and
he
remained
a
divisive
figure
because
of
his
role
akihito
will
abdicate
next
year
on
he
will
for
the
last
time
as
reigning
emperor
take
part
in
an
annual
memorial
ceremony
honouring
war
dead
held
on
the
anniversary
of
japan
s
surrender
his
retirement
comes
amid
tensions
with
china
and
the
koreas
and
his
legacy
appears
threatened
by
a
japanese
drift
to
the
right
mirrored
in
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
s
conservative
agenda
japanese
political
leaders
have
expressed
regret
remorse
and
apology
for
their
country
s
wartime
actions
but
remarks
by
the
emperor
have
a
different
weight
experts
say
emperors
are
like
popes
their
gestures
carry
a
symbolic
message
said
andrew
horvat
a
visiting
professor
at
japan
s
josai
international
university
politicians
have
sometimes
undercut
official
apologies
but
akihito
s
message
has
remained
consistent
people
see
akihito
and
michiko
as
sincerely
and
respectfully
trying
to
reach
out
to
wartime
victims
in
a
deeply
symbolic
and
very
reconciliatory
way
said
jennifer
lind
a
dartmouth
college
professor
who
has
written
about
apologies
friends
and
scholars
credit
akihito
s
education
with
laying
the
foundations
for
how
he
forged
his
role
influences
included
quaker
tutor
elizabeth
vining
and
former
keio
university
head
shinzo
koizumi
who
saw
many
of
his
students
die
in
the
conflict
currently
most
japanese
people
think
that
the
emperor
is
gentle
and
kind
mototsugu
akashi
a
former
classmate
told
reuters
but
that
is
clearly
a
the
makeover
of
the
monarchy
began
after
japan
s
surrender
in
when
akihito
was
in
theory
the
emperor
can
say
what
he
likes
as
long
as
his
remarks
don
t
violate
the
constitution
which
defines
the
emperor
as
the
symbol
of
the
state
and
the
unity
of
the
people
devoid
of
governmental
power
and
unable
to
interfere
in
politics
in
practice
akihito
s
public
remarks
are
carefully
vetted
to
ensure
they
don
t
violate
those
rules
with
delicate
discussions
determining
how
forthright
he
can
be
akihito
strained
against
those
limits
say
those
who
know
him
i
know
that
for
one
or
two
speeches
he
was
angry
with
the
imperial
household
agency
and
foreign
ministry
about
the
words
to
be
used
said
michael
barrett
who
knew
akihito
while
head
of
the
british
council
in
japan
during
the
it
was
said
that
they
the
imperial
couple
were
birds
in
a
gilded
cage
but
he
opened
the
door
of
that
cage
he
added
in
one
early
example
seoul
in
may
wanted
the
new
emperor
to
apologise
for
japan
s
often
brutal
colonisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
ruling
party
lawmakers
objected
and
prime
minister
toshiki
kaifu
offered
to
apologise
instead
to
south
korean
president
roh
tae
woo
akihito
however
had
his
own
ideas
the
current
emperor
wanted
to
make
clear
that
it
was
japan
that
caused
the
suffering
of
the
korean
people
makoto
watanabe
a
former
imperial
grand
chamberlain
an
aide
to
the
emperor
told
reuters
in
an
interview
ultimately
akihito
had
his
way
after
private
negotiations
with
government
officials
i
think
of
the
sufferings
your
people
underwent
during
this
unfortunate
period
which
was
brought
about
by
my
country
and
can
not
but
feel
the
deepest
regret
he
said
at
a
banquet
for
roh
the
early
years
of
akihito
s
reign
saw
a
flourishing
of
debate
over
japan
s
responsibility
for
world
war
two
and
a
series
of
government
apologies
the
statements
and
efforts
to
teach
children
about
japan
s
wartime
actions
sparked
a
conservative
backlash
against
a
view
of
history
seen
as
undermining
national
pride
and
identity
in
akihito
became
the
first
modern
japanese
monarch
to
visit
china
domestic
groups
opposed
the
trip
while
chinese
activists
demanded
an
apology
while
in
china
the
emperor
said
he
felt
deep
sorrow
for
the
suffering
japan
inflicted
on
the
chinese
people
the
next
year
he
began
visits
to
wartime
sites
beginning
in
okinawa
where
resentment
lingered
against
mainland
japan
over
the
islanders
wartime
sacrifices
six
decades
after
the
war
s
end
he
visited
saipan
a
territory
on
his
first
trip
to
a
foreign
battleground
he
had
felt
strongly
that
he
wanted
to
pray
for
all
the
souls
who
died
in
the
war
not
just
domestically
but
overseas
not
just
japanese
but
all
the
people
of
the
world
haketa
said
usually
the
emperor
s
overseas
trips
are
in
response
to
requests
by
the
government
but
this
trip
was
based
on
his
strong
personal
desire
he
added
despite
akihito
s
age
and
health
problems
he
has
had
heart
surgery
and
been
treated
for
prostate
cancer
he
has
continued
his
travels
in
he
and
michiko
went
to
palau
s
tiny
peleliu
island
site
of
a
fierce
battle
in
in
they
visited
the
philippines
and
this
year
returned
to
okinawa
on
the
anniversary
of
japan
s
defeat
akihito
expressed
deep
remorse
over
the
war
a
nuanced
departure
from
his
annual
script
many
liberals
and
moderate
conservatives
saw
it
as
a
subtle
rebuke
to
abe
who
a
day
earlier
had
expressed
utmost
grief
for
the
suffering
japan
inflicted
but
said
future
generations
should
not
have
to
keep
apologising
months
later
akihito
told
a
news
conference
to
mark
his
birthday
i
believe
having
thorough
knowledge
about
the
last
war
and
deepening
our
thoughts
about
the
war
is
most
important
for
the
future
of
akihito
s
heir
crown
prince
naruhito
holds
similar
views
on
teaching
about
the
tragedy
of
the
war
it
is
important
to
look
back
in
a
humble
way
on
the
past
and
pass
on
correctly
the
tragic
experiences
of
war
from
the
generation
that
experienced
the
war
to
those
who
have
grown
up
without
knowledge
of
it
naruhito
told
a
news
conference
ahead
of
his
birthday
but
it
is
unclear
how
much
impact
naruhito
will
have
partly
because
like
most
japanese
he
did
not
experience
the
war
if
he
speaks
of
remorse
many
people
will
ask
remorse
for
what
