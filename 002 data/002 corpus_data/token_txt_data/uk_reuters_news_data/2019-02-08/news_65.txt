london
reuters
britain
will
take
a
few
days
to
formulate
proposals
to
put
to
the
european
union
in
an
attempt
to
resolve
the
issue
of
irish
border
arrangements
after
brexit
foreign
minister
jeremy
hunt
told
bbc
radio
on
thursday
british
lawmakers
on
tuesday
instructed
prime
minister
theresa
may
to
reopen
her
brexit
treaty
with
the
eu
to
replace
a
controversial
irish
border
arrangement
the
backstop
but
promptly
received
a
rejection
from
brussels
we
will
put
those
proposals
together
it
is
going
to
take
a
few
days
to
do
that
hunt
said
i
happen
to
believe
there
is
potential
along
all
the
different
routes
that
have
been
discussed
but
we
need
to
put
those
together
make
sure
they
meet
the
concerns
the
eu
has
expressed
and
then
i
think
we
will
have
a
proper
discussion
he
said
hunt
said
it
was
too
early
to
say
if
an
extension
to
the
brexit
process
would
be
required
britain
is
due
to
leave
on
march
i
think
it
is
true
that
if
we
ended
up
approving
a
deal
in
the
days
before
march
then
we
might
need
some
extra
time
to
pass
critical
legislation
said
hunt
but
if
we
are
able
to
make
progress
sooner
then
that
might
not
be
the
leader
of
the
house
of
commons
andrea
leadsom
told
mps
on
thursday
that
parliament
s
planned
february
recess
would
be
cancelled
so
it
could
make
progress
on
key
business
the
government
has
also
said
it
is
looking
at
extending
the
hours
during
which
parliament
sits
asked
about
hunt
s
comments
may
s
spokesman
said
the
prime
minister
s
position
on
this
is
unchanged
we
will
be
leaving
on
march
we
are
determined
to
have
everything
in
place
in
order
for
us
to
leave
on
march
he
added
the
fact
that
recess
won
t
be
taking
place
and
members
of
parliament
will
be
sitting
shows
you
that
we
are
taking
all
available
steps
to
make
sure
that
march
is
our
exit
