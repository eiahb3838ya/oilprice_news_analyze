jolted by ex-allies' criminal cases, trump faces election and legal risks
reuters
president
donald
trump
suffered
twin
setbacks
on
tuesday
with
two
facing
prison
sentences
and
one
of
them
saying
trump
told
him
to
commit
a
crime
possibly
hurting
his
republican
party
s
election
prospects
and
widening
a
criminal
probe
that
has
overshadowed
his
presidency
within
minutes
of
each
other
in
separate
courts
former
trump
campaign
manager
paul
manafort
was
found
guilty
on
tax
and
bank
fraud
charges
while
trump
s
former
personal
lawyer
michael
cohen
pleaded
guilty
to
a
range
of
charges
cohen
also
testified
that
trump
directed
him
to
commit
a
crime
by
arranging
payments
ahead
of
the
presidential
election
to
silence
two
women
who
said
they
had
affairs
with
trump
the
president
has
denied
having
affairs
with
the
women
his
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
has
said
the
payments
were
made
to
spare
trump
and
his
family
embarrassment
and
were
unrelated
to
the
campaign
the
setbacks
on
tuesday
refocused
attention
on
special
counsel
robert
mueller
s
inquiry
into
russian
meddling
in
the
presidential
election
whether
trump
s
campaign
colluded
with
moscow
and
whether
trump
obstructed
justice
by
firing
director
james
comey
who
was
formerly
in
charge
of
the
investigation
moscow
has
said
it
did
not
interfere
in
the
election
and
trump
has
denied
collusion
calling
mueller
s
probe
a
witch
of
the
two
latest
developments
cohen
s
plea
deal
was
the
more
troublesome
said
those
around
trump
a
bad
day
for
the
home
team
said
one
source
close
to
the
president
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
the
source
added
that
the
legal
woes
could
depress
voter
turnout
and
increase
republicans
risk
of
losing
their
majority
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
november
s
congressional
elections
this
hurts
our
midterm
a
democratic
victory
in
november
would
limit
trump
s
ability
to
push
through
legislation
and
increase
the
risk
of
calls
for
his
impeachment
cohen
s
lawyer
lanny
davis
said
late
on
tuesday
that
his
client
was
more
than
happy
to
tell
mueller
s
legal
team
everything
he
knows
about
trump
democrats
pounced
on
the
cohen
and
manafort
cases
saying
they
bolstered
their
argument
that
the
trump
white
house
was
weighed
down
by
scandal
the
american
people
deserve
answers
regarding
the
president
s
role
in
these
corrupt
and
criminal
actions
said
democratic
representative
rosa
delauro
rodell
mollineau
a
senior
democratic
strategist
said
the
news
adds
to
a
constant
drumbeat
that
will
ultimately
affect
some
independent
voters
and
help
democrats
at
the
polls
manafort
being
convicted
on
its
own
might
not
sway
any
votes
but
given
the
totality
of
criminality
uncovered
it
will
be
hard
for
some
republicans
to
ignore
and
even
harder
to
still
there
were
no
immediate
calls
for
trump
s
impeachment
and
republican
lawmakers
did
not
join
the
chorus
of
criticism
from
democratic
ranks
the
impact
of
the
cohen
and
manafort
cases
will
likely
depend
on
how
they
affect
the
turnout
of
republican
and
democratic
voters
in
november
while
he
undoubtedly
had
a
bad
day
on
tuesday
some
analysts
said
trump
might
be
able
to
turn
the
setbacks
to
his
advantage
by
reinforcing
core
supporters
views
that
he
is
under
siege
said
andy
smith
director
of
the
university
of
new
hampshire
survey
center
in
midterm
elections
the
president
s
party
tends
to
be
less
interested
and
less
motivated
to
vote
but
one
thing
that
will
motivate
people
to
get
out
and
vote
is
if
they
believe
the
party
is
being
attacked
unfairly
he
said
at
a
rally
in
charleston
west
virginia
on
tuesday
night
a
relatively
subdued
trump
did
not
mention
either
the
cohen
or
manafort
case
instead
as
supporters
cheered
him
on
he
made
fun
of
his
opponents
focus
on
the
mueller
investigation
saying
they
were
desperate
to
find
collusion
with
russians
where
is
the
collusion
where
is
it
he
said
mimicking
his
critics
josh
mcgrew
who
travelled
from
huntington
west
virginia
for
the
rally
called
the
investigation
a
smear
campaign
and
said
his
support
for
trump
was
unshaken
this
is
all
about
finding
out
anything
they
can
in
somebody
s
past
mcgrew
said
they
haven
t
come
up
with
anything
in
a
year
and
a
half
almost
two
polling
by
has
shown
trump
s
job
approval
rating
holding
steady
at
about
percent
even
with
mueller
s
investigation
already
bringing
guilty
pleas
by
several
former
trump
advisers
the
cohen
and
manafort
cases
were
unlikely
to
erode
trump
s
support
from
his
political
base
or
the
republican
party
establishment
said
larry
sabato
a
political
analyst
and
director
of
the
university
of
virginia
center
for
politics
i
don
t
think
there
is
any
change
at
all
said
sabato
that
s
the
amazing
part
of
it
the
trump
base
and
virtually
the
entire
republican
party
could
care
less
the
polls
will
bear
