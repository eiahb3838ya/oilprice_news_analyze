london
reuters
business
activity
in
britain
s
dominant
services
sector
slowed
to
a
low
last
month
and
firms
expectations
for
the
coming
year
are
the
gloomiest
since
just
after
the
brexit
vote
a
major
survey
showed
on
monday
the
ihs
purchasing
managers
index
pmi
dropped
to
in
october
from
in
september
its
lowest
since
a
patch
of
unusually
icy
weather
in
march
and
a
bigger
fall
than
economists
had
forecast
in
a
reuters
poll
britain
s
economy
has
slowed
since
the
june
referendum
and
monday
s
data
added
to
signs
that
a
patch
of
solid
growth
over
the
summer
months
is
now
fading
as
firms
focus
on
risks
from
brexit
and
warning
signs
about
the
global
economy
with
autumn
upon
us
consumers
are
tightening
their
belts
and
with
the
prospect
of
any
greater
certainty
seemingly
as
distant
as
ever
businesses
are
struggling
to
maintain
their
confident
outlook
said
chris
a
managing
director
at
lloyds
bank
s
commercial
lending
unit
businesses
expectations
for
stronger
activity
over
the
next
months
were
the
weakest
since
july
when
they
briefly
hit
a
crisis
low
following
the
vote
to
leave
the
european
union
sterling
briefly
dipped
to
a
day
s
low
against
the
dollar
after
the
data
but
market
reaction
was
muted
overall
prime
minister
theresa
may
has
yet
to
agree
a
withdrawal
deal
with
the
eu
to
ensure
goods
services
and
workers
will
continue
to
be
able
to
cross
borders
easily
after
britain
leaves
the
bloc
on
march
next
year
businesses
also
reported
headwinds
from
a
slowing
global
economy
trade
tensions
and
financial
market
turbulence
it
therefore
remains
unclear
as
to
the
extent
to
which
brexit
worries
are
exacerbating
or
obfuscating
a
more
slowing
of
the
economy
ihs
markit
economist
chris
williamson
said
last
week
the
bank
of
england
forecast
britain
s
rate
of
economic
growth
would
halve
to
percent
in
the
final
three
months
of
from
an
estimated
percent
in
the
third
quarter
of
the
year
when
good
weather
lifted
consumer
spending
but
governor
mark
carney
said
the
central
bank
would
look
beyond
what
it
expects
to
be
growth
volatility
and
might
need
to
raise
interest
rates
faster
than
markets
expect
if
brexit
ends
up
going
relatively
smoothly
the
weak
services
data
follows
the
softest
manufacturing
pmi
since
the
brexit
vote
the
two
pmis
combined
with
more
robust
construction
data
are
jointly
the
weakest
since
march
and
point
to
quarterly
growth
of
percent
if
things
do
not
improve
ihs
markit
said
businesses
said
new
orders
were
coming
in
at
the
slowest
rate
since
july
and
their
costs
were
rising
at
the
fastest
rate
since
june
due
to
higher
fuel
bills
and
rising
wages
however
they
expected
orders
to
pick
up
if
the
brexit
talks
were
concluded
successfully
the
services
pmi
in
britain
does
not
include
the
public
sector
or
retailers
who
enjoyed
strong
consumer
spending
over
the
summer
but
face
challenges
from
online
sales
firms
such
as
hotels
restaurants
and
leisure
companies
reported
the
weakest
pmi
performance
