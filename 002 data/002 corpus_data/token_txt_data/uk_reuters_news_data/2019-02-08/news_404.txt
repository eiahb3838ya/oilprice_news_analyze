british
prime
minister
theresa
may
must
either
govern
or
quit
a
senior
eurosceptic
lawmaker
in
her
conservative
party
said
on
monday
after
she
delayed
a
vote
in
parliament
on
her
brexit
deal
what
has
two
years
of
theresa
may
doing
brexit
amounted
to
an
undeliverable
deal
parliament
would
roundly
reject
if
the
prime
minister
has
the
gumption
to
allow
it
to
go
before
the
house
of
commons
who
leads
an
influential
group
of
eurosceptic
conservative
members
of
parliament
said
in
a
statement
this
is
not
governing
it
risks
putting
opposition
labour
leader
jeremy
corbyn
into
government
by
failing
to
deliver
brexit
we
can
not
continue
like
this
the
prime
minister
must
either
govern
