explainer - liquefaction adds to devastation in indonesia earthquake
reuters
liquefied
soil
caused
numerous
buildings
to
collapse
in
the
indonesian
city
of
palu
after
friday
s
magnitude
earthquake
which
has
killed
more
than
people
here
s
a
brief
explanation
of
liquefaction
how
common
it
is
and
where
it
is
likely
to
happen
liquefaction
is
a
phenomenon
where
saturated
sand
and
silt
take
on
the
characteristics
of
a
liquid
during
the
intense
shaking
of
an
earthquake
according
to
the
united
states
geological
survey
website
it
takes
place
when
a
quake
has
increased
water
pressure
in
saturated
soil
and
made
particles
in
the
soil
lose
contact
with
each
other
making
the
soil
particularly
sandy
soil
act
like
liquid
the
effect
has
been
likened
to
slapping
a
wet
hard
beach
and
the
sand
beneath
your
palm
becomes
jelly
in
the
palu
neighborhood
of
balaroa
about
houses
were
swallowed
up
when
the
earthquake
caused
soil
to
liquefy
the
national
rescue
agency
said
satellite
images
of
the
petobo
district
south
of
palu
s
airport
showed
another
large
area
of
urban
development
seemingly
wiped
clear
of
buildings
when
the
quake
hit
the
layers
below
the
surface
of
the
earth
became
muddy
and
loose
said
sutopo
purwo
nugroho
spokesman
of
indonesia
s
national
disaster
mitigation
agency
mud
with
such
large
mass
volume
drowned
and
dragged
the
housing
complex
in
petobo
so
that
most
of
them
became
as
if
they
were
absorbed
we
estimate
units
of
houses
are
amateur
video
footage
appeared
to
show
trees
buildings
and
even
a
large
communications
tower
being
tossed
around
in
landslides
reuters
was
unable
to
verify
the
footage
among
those
killed
were
children
at
a
christian
bible
study
camp
that
was
hit
by
liquefaction
a
red
cross
official
said
liquefaction
is
most
likely
to
happen
in
reclaimed
land
areas
with
shallow
water
tables
and
close
to
the
sea
or
rivers
are
also
susceptible
to
liquefaction
compared
with
what
s
been
formed
naturally
over
a
long
period
of
time
what
s
manmade
has
been
constructed
for
a
short
period
of
time
where
soil
particles
are
only
loosely
connected
to
each
other
said
toshitaka
kamai
professor
at
kyoto
university
s
disaster
prevention
research
institute
the
eastern
japanese
city
of
urayasu
where
the
majority
of
land
was
formed
by
reclamation
saw
percent
of
its
land
affected
by
liquefaction
following
the
massive
earthquake
it
took
the
city
six
years
to
repair
all
the
damaged
underground
sewerage
water
and
gas
facilities
it
renders
underground
pipes
mangled
mess
one
of
its
characteristics
is
it
takes
time
to
recover
from
liquefaction
damage
yoshiharu
yokoyama
an
executive
at
jibannet
co
ltd
which
provides
soil
analysis
services
conditions
that
could
lead
to
liquefaction
can
be
found
in
many
places
in
indonesia
and
throughout
asia
said
mark
quigley
associate
professor
of
earthquake
science
at
the
university
of
melbourne
people
need
to
live
in
places
that
are
habitable
for
a
whole
bunch
of
reasons
in
the
case
of
palu
it
s
on
a
very
nice
natural
bay
it
s
on
a
river
that
would
have
provided
historically
a
source
of
water
for
them
there
s
a
lot
of
really
mountainous
terrain
all
around
it
it
s
not
like
they
had
endless
opportunity
to
just
choose
whatever
site
they
earthquake
and
soil
experts
say
liquefaction
is
fairly
common
it
happened
after
the
massive
magnitude
quake
that
hit
eastern
japan
in
and
numerous
other
japanese
earthquakes
in
recent
years
it
has
also
been
reported
in
several
previous
indonesian
earthquakes
