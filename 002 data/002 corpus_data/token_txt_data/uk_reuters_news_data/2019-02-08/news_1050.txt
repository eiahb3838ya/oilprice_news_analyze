reuters
ambassador
to
the
united
nations
nikki
haley
accused
russia
on
monday
of
cheating
on
sanctions
on
north
korea
and
said
washington
has
evidence
of
consistent
and
russian
the
showdown
between
the
united
states
and
russia
over
north
korea
publicly
showed
cracks
in
the
unity
of
the
security
council
which
has
unanimously
boosted
sanctions
since
in
a
bid
to
choke
off
funding
for
pyongyang
s
nuclear
and
ballistic
missile
programs
haley
told
the
security
council
that
russia
was
helping
north
korea
illegally
obtain
fuel
through
transfers
at
sea
had
refused
to
expel
a
north
korean
who
the
council
blacklisted
last
year
and
had
pushed
for
changes
to
an
independent
report
on
sanctions
violations
to
cover
up
breaches
by
russians
russian
ambassador
vassily
nebenzia
said
moscow
had
not
pressured
the
authors
of
the
report
and
blamed
haley
for
heightening
tensions
he
also
pointed
out
that
the
report
had
determined
that
a
specific
transfer
of
fuel
by
a
russian
ship
cited
by
haley
was
not
a
violation
haley
said
washington
has
tracked
some
cases
this
year
of
oil
tankers
delivering
fuel
to
north
korea
obtained
through
transfers
at
sea
in
breach
of
a
cap
she
did
not
say
how
many
transfers
may
have
received
russian
help
russia
must
cease
its
violations
of
north
korea
sanctions
it
must
end
its
concerted
effort
to
cover
up
evidence
of
sanctions
violations
she
said
its
violations
are
not
they
are
russia
and
china
have
suggested
the
security
council
discuss
easing
sanctions
after
president
donald
trump
and
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
met
in
june
and
kim
pledged
to
work
towards
denuclearisation
haley
said
that
while
difficult
sensitive
talks
between
the
united
states
and
north
korea
are
ongoing
it
was
the
wrong
time
to
start
easing
sanctions
on
pyongyang
it
is
impossible
to
come
to
an
agreement
if
you
offer
nothing
in
return
for
your
demands
said
nebenzia
suggesting
that
a
measure
could
be
for
north
and
south
korea
to
sign
a
peace
treaty
chinese
ambassador
ma
zhaoxu
said
beijing
implements
sanctions
on
north
korea
and
warned
that
confronting
pyongyang
would
be
a
dead
he
called
for
progress
in
negotiations
and
urged
the
security
council
to
remain
united
on
the
issue
resorting
to
force
will
bring
nothing
but
disastrous
consequences
ma
told
the
council
political
affairs
chief
rosemary
dicarlo
told
the
council
that
while
there
had
been
some
recent
positive
developments
there
continue
to
be
signs
the
dprk
north
korea
is
maintaining
and
developing
its
nuclear
weapons
and
ballistic
missile
