berlin
reuters
the
german
air

was
no
suspicion

carrying
chancellor
angela
merkel
to
the
summit
in
argentina
to
make
an
unscheduled
landing
earlier
german

cited
security

saying

checking
whether
the

on
thursday
had
a
criminal
background
though
the
sources
added
that
investigators
would
typically
look
in
all
directions
after
such
an
incident
but
a
spokesman
for
the
german
air
force
said
there
was
no
suspicion
of
any
crime
adding
it
s
a
standard
check
of
the
radio
equipment
that
merkel
was
on
her
way
from
germany
to
the
summit
when
the
government
s
airbus
made
an
unscheduled
but
safe
landing
at

late
on
thursday
guido
henrich
commander
of
the
german

force
s
government
fleet
told
reporters
the
pilots
experienced
the
radio
failure
over
the
netherlands
and
that
other
systems
failed
too
so
they
landed
at
airport
an
electronic
failure
was
the
problem
the
part
concerned
was
an
electronic
distribution
box
which
we
have
changed
henrich
adding
that
the
air
force
was
sending
another
plane
to
argentina
on
friday
for
merkel
s
return
journey
from
the
der
spiegel
magazine
said
the
government
plane
s
entire
communication
system
malfunctioned
constituting
a
serious
emergency
with
the

forced
to
plan
the
landing
using
an
satellite
phone
the
air
force
spokesman
said
the
plane
had
not
discharged
jet
fuel
before
