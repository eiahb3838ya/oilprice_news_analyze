carney - no deal brexit would prompt interest rate review
farnborough
england
reuters
bank
of
england
governor
mark
carney
said
on
tuesday
that
a
brexit
would
have
big
economic
consequences
prompt
a
review
of
interest
rates
and
leave
many
bankers
idle
britain
and
the
eu
have
negotiated
a
transition
deal
that
would
effectively
keep
britain
as
member
of
the
bloc
from
brexit
day
next
march
until
the
end
of
but
it
has
not
been
ratified
yet
meaning
the
uk
could
crash
out
and
have
to
rely
on
wto
trading
terms
which
carney
said
would
leave
the
country
worse
off
our
job
is
to
make
sure
we
are
as
prepared
as
possible
carney
told
mps
at
a
parliamentary
hearing
held
at
an
air
show
in
farnborough
southern
england
crashing
out
would
prompt
the
bank
s
monetary
policy
committee
to
reassess
the
economic
outlook
and
interest
rates
it
would
be
a
material
event
i
wouldn
t
prejudge
in
which
direction
though
carney
said
speaking
very
narrowly
about
the
financial
services
side
in
the
event
of
a
scenario
there
would
be
big
economic
consequences
we
might
have
a
lot
of
idle
bankers
as
there
is
not
a
lot
of
demand
for
their
services
carney
said
lenders
insurers
and
asset
managers
in
britain
are
playing
safe
and
opening
new
eu
hubs
by
march
to
maintain
links
with
customers
there
irrespective
of
whether
a
transition
deal
of
generous
future
trading
terms
are
secured
but
they
worry
that
without
a
transition
deal
existing
contracts
such
as
derivatives
and
insurance
policies
would
be
disrupted
leaving
consumers
unable
to
make
claims
or
companies
not
covered
against
adverse
moves
in
currencies
or
borrowing
costs
britain
has
said
it
will
legislate
to
ensure
continuity
in
contracts
and
that
the
eu
must
reciprocate
but
the
bloc
says
it
was
up
to
banks
and
not
public
authorities
to
get
ready
yes
we
are
concerned
that
the
eu
has
not
yet
indicated
its
solution
the
private
sector
can
not
solve
these
issues
carney
said
this
is
fundamentally
about
taking
responsibility
to
protect
the
financial
system
it
s
cold
comfort
but
it
will
be
worse
in
europe
than
it
is
britain
s
banks
however
hold
enough
capital
and
cash
reserves
to
withstand
a
disorderly
brexit
carney
said
britain
last
week
published
its
proposals
for
a
future
trading
agreement
with
the
eu
after
brexit
saying
it
wanted
close
ties
in
goods
but
with
financial
services
having
less
access
to
the
bloc
than
now
the
financial
sector
attacked
the
government
for
not
backing
the
industry
s
more
ambitious
proposals
that
seek
to
replicate
existing
market
access
the
industry
s
proposals
which
the
bank
had
also
backed
were
rejected
by
eu
officials
in
brussels
who
say
it
would
mean
britain
getting
all
the
benefits
of
eu
membership
without
the
costs
and
obligations
carney
said
it
was
too
soon
to
judge
what
the
government
s
proposals
meant
for
financial
services
or
for
the
bank
s
ability
to
take
all
decisions
necessary
to
keep
the
financial
system
and
banks
stable
it
s
premature
for
us
to
make
a
judgement
on
the
white
paper
and
the
outcome
of
these
negotiations
it
s
also
not
clear
which
activities
are
going
to
be
in
scope
carney
said
the
white
paper
was
a
first
step
in
a
hugely
important
negotiation
