buttler boosts england as they push lead towards 250
southampton

reuters
an
enthralling
fourth
test
between
england
and
india
remained
intriguingly
balanced
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
as
hosts
edged
to
and
a
lead
of
on
a
wearing
pitch
that
should
continue
to
cause
problems
for
the
batsmen
a
battling
from
jos
buttler
and
an
unbeaten
from
sam
curran
ensured
england
reached
the
close
just
about
on
target
for
the
win
that
would
clinch
the
series
but
india
remain
very
much
in
the
game
particularly
after
mohammed
shami
trapped
adil
rashid
lbw
for
in
the
final
over
and
will
look
to
knock
over
the
final
two
wickets
cheaply
on
sunday
much
will
rest
on
the
shoulders
of
curran
who
after
top
scoring
in
england
s
first
innings
will
look
to
push
the
lead
up
towards
on
sunday
when
conditions
are
forecast
to
be
overcast
and
favouring
the
seamers
we
ve
got
plenty
to
work
with
already
but
anything
about
would
be
a
great
number
to
try
and
eke
out
tomorrow
morning
that
would
give
us
plenty
of
runs
on
a
challenging
pitch
said
buttler
for
india
to
win
and
level
the
series
they
will
need
to
improve
on
their
poor
record
of
winning
only
three
tests
outside
asia
when
set
a
target
in
excess
of
england
had
resumed
on
six
without
loss
in
the
morning
a
deficit
of
with
their
openers
finally
hoping
to
post
the
sort
of
partnership
that
has
eluded
them
all
series
once
again
they
failed
but
several
batsmen
dug
out
valuable
contributions
each
time
india
s
attack
sensed
they
might
be
getting
on
top
after
alastair
cook
and
the
promoted
moeen
ali
fell
cheaply
joe
root
and
keaton
jennings
provided
the
first
resistance
before
the
opener
was
trapped
lbw
by
shami
for
to
the
final
ball
of
the
morning
session
shami
claimed
another
success
with
the
first
ball
after
lunch
when
he
bowled
jonny
bairstow
with
a
delivery
the
batsman
completely
misjudged
shami
then
ran
out
root
on
with
a
direct
hit
from
to
reduce
england
to
but
buttler
has
provided
terrific
value
down
the
order
for
england
in
three
of
his
innings
since
winning
a
recall
this
summer
his
was
his
ninth
in
tests
and
third
of
a
productive
summer
during
which
he
also
scored
a
century
after
sharing
partnerships
of
with
ben
stokes
and
with
curran
he
fell
lbw
late
in
the
day
to
the
new
ball
which
ishant
sharma
moved
back
into
his
pads
sharma
proved
a
real
handful
after
earlier
being
twice
warned
for
running
on
the
pitch
a
transgression
that
would
have
led
to
his
removal
from
the
attack
if
repeated
clearly
concerned
skipper
virat
kohli
voluntarily
removed
him
from
the
attack
just
when
his
threat
was
at
his
most
potent
allowing
england
to
regroup
at
a
key
moment
shami
was
the
pick
of
india
s
bowlers
