australia
s
competition
watchdog
on
monday
recommended
tougher
scrutiny
and
a
new
regulatory
body
to
check
the
dominance
of
tech
giants
facebook
inc
and
alphabet
inc
s
google
in
the
country
s
online
advertising
and
news
markets
the
recommendation
in
a
preliminary
report
on
the
firms
market
power
is
being
closely
watched
around
the
world
as
lawmakers
wrestle
with
the
powerful
tech
firms
large
and
growing
influence
in
public
life
from
privacy
to
publishing
it
comes
days
after
australia
passed
laws
forcing
tech
companies
to
help
police
access
private
user
data
and
amid
growing
concern
from
authorities
worldwide
about
the
giants
commercial
behavior
and
distribution
of
fake
news
when
you
get
to
a
certain
stage
and
you
get
market
power
which
both
google
and
facebook
have
with
that
comes
special
responsibilities
and
that
means
also
additional
scrutiny
australian
competition
and
consumer
commission
accc
chairman
rod
sims
told
reporters
in
sydney
he
said
the
companies
enormous
market
share
google
has
a
percent
share
of
web
searches
in
australia
and
opaque
methods
for
ranking
advertisements
gave
the
firms
the
ability
and
incentive
to
favor
their
businesses
over
advertisers
the
idea
of
the
regulator
role
would
be
to
keep
an
eye
on
that
and
proactively
bring
some
transparency
he
said
adding
the
two
firms
also
had
outsized
influence
over
news
distribution
drafting
the
report
had
also
spurred
five
investigations
into
possible
consumer
or
privacy
law
breaches
in
australia
sims
said
without
disclosing
which
firms
they
concerned
facebook
and
google
in
separate
statements
both
said
they
will
continue
to
work
with
the
accc
while
the
regulator
prepares
its
final
report
due
in
june
the
two
firms
have
already
promised
to
do
more
to
tackle
the
spread
of
fake
news
and
in
submissions
to
the
accc
said
they
provided
users
access
to
global
news
articles
while
providing
advertisers
a
cheap
way
of
reaching
big
audiences
the
accc
has
said
its
recommendations
are
subject
to
change
but
suggests
handing
the
new
regulator
investigative
powers
to
examine
how
the
companies
rank
advertisements
and
news
articles
it
is
potentially
a
game
changer
margaret
simons
an
associate
professor
of
media
at
monash
university
in
melbourne
said
by
phone
since
it
would
bring
the
tech
companies
under
a
regulatory
framework
more
typically
applied
to
media
firms
with
the
if
being
whether
or
not
governments
act
she
said
adding
that
the
accc
s
work
was
being
closely
watched
internationally
australia
s
government
which
ordered
the
probe
into
the
firms
influence
a
year
ago
as
part
of
wider
media
reforms
said
it
would
consider
the
accc
s
final
recommendations
in
june
traditional
media
companies
in
australia
including
nine
entertainment
co
holdings
ltd
and
news
corp
s
local
arm
already
squeezed
by
online
rivals
