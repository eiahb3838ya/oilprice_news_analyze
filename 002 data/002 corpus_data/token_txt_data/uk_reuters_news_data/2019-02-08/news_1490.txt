s
negotiating
position
on
britain
s
exit
from
the

irish
prime
minister
leo
varadkar
said
on
tuesday
britain
s
parliament
on
monday
accepted
the
insistence
of
eurosceptic
hardliners
in
her
conservative
party
for
a
legal
guarantee
that
there
will
be
no
customs
border
in
the
irish
sea
that
move
could
complicate
ireland
s
demand
for
a
backstop
agreement
that
could
keep
northern
ireland
but
not
the
rest
of
the
united
kingdom
in
an
eu

could
reach
agreement
on
the
terms
of
brexit
by
october
six
months
ahead
of
britain
s
intended
withdrawal
but
we
can
t
make
assumptions
that
the
withdrawal
agreement
will
get
through
westminster
british
parliament
he
added
it
s
not
evident
or
not
obvious
that
the
government
of
britain
has
the
majority
for
any
form
of
brexit
quite
frankly
that
shouldn
t
give
us
cause
for
panic
and
that
shouldn
t
give
us
any
reason
to
change
our
varadkar
said
ireland
needed
to
step
up
preparations
for
a
scenario
although
he
added
that
he
thought
it
unlikely
britain
would
crash
chaotically
out
of
the
eu
