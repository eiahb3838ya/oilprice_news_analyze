ge dismisses talk that it may owe billions of dollars in taxes
reuters
general
electric
co
on
monday
downplayed
concerns
that
its
tax
liabilities
could
increase
by
billions
of
dollars
and
that
a
decision
by
british
tax
authorities
could
saddle
the
company
with
an
additional
billion
tax
bill
based
on
current
law
and
guidance
we
believe
our
current
accrual
is
a
reasonable
estimate
for
the
enactment
of
tax
reform
todd
ernst
ge
s
vice
president
of
investor
communications
said
in
an
unusually
detailed
email
to
investors
on
monday
referring
to
the
tax
cuts
and
jobs
act
of
the
bill
passed
by
congress
that
significantly
reduced
corporate
tax
rates
ernst
said
ge
had
disclosed
the
risk
of
billion
in
additional
british
tax
with
earnings
but
considers
it
unlikely
we
expect
to
successfully
contest
the
assessment
if
made
and
not
owe
any
additional
taxes
to
the
ernst
said
the
payments
would
come
after
ge
reported
a
billion
quarterly
loss
last
week
and
has
seen
its
cash
income
plummet
as
it
has
taken
more
than
billion
in
writedowns
and
charges
in
less
than
a
year
from
its
power
division
care
insurance
portfolio
the
tax
law
and
other
issues
ernst
s
comments
came
after
analyst
john
inch
at
research
firm
gordon
haskett
said
years
of
booking
inexplicably
low
tax
rates
could
land
ge
with
billions
of
dollars
of
additional
cash
tax
payments
in
the
united
states
ge
likely
owed
up
to
billion
in
taxes
under
the
corporate
tax
cuts
but
took
only
a
billion
charge
while
saying
offsets
would
reduce
cash
tax
costs
in
the
future
the
taxman
knocks
said
inch
in
the
note
published
on
friday
if
even
some
of
these
offsets
are
disallowed
the
company
could
wind
up
owing
a
large
tax
bill
near
inch
also
said
ge
s
sheet
and
sheet
liabilities
could
exceed
billion
paying
would
be
difficult
as
ge
is
trying
to
turn
around
troubled
businesses
ernst
said
ge
expects
tax
authorities
to
provide
more
clarity
possibly
in
the
fourth
quarter
and
ge
would
then
disclose
an
increase
or
decrease
in
reporting
