mps criticise rbs and barclays for online banking outages
reuters
royal
bank
of
scotland
apologised
for
outages
that
hit
its
online
and
mobile
banking
services
on
friday
the
latest
in
a
string
of
such
failings
at
british
banks
which
have
drawn
criticism
from
customers
and
members
of
parliament
rbs
later
on
friday
said
it
had
fixed
the
problems
which
followed
similar
outages
on
thursday
that
hit
barclays
the
bank
and
fintech
firm
cashplus
mps
on
britain
s
treasury
select
committee
in
letters
published
on
friday
called
on
barclays
and
rbs
to
explain
what
caused
the
problems
and
set
out
how
they
would
compensate
customers
who
suffered
financial
losses
as
a
result
the
outages
come
when
britain
s
lenders
have
been
driving
customers
towards
such
services
as
the
banks
cull
branch
networks
to
cut
costs
regulators
and
politicians
are
increasing
scrutiny
over
banks
cyber
resilience
high
street
banks
justify
the
closure
of
their
branch
networks
on
the
basis
that
they
are
providing
a
seamless
online
and
mobile
phone
banking
service
these
justifications
carry
little
weight
if
their
banking
apps
and
websites
can
not
be
relied
upon
nicky
morgan
chair
of
the
treasury
committee
said
morgan
gave
the
banks
until
friday
to
respond
to
her
questions
about
the
outages
royal
bank
of
scotland
chief
executive
ross
mcewan
told
lbc
radio
that
the
outage
may
be
related
to
regular
changes
it
had
made
to
its
technology
such
a
change
to
its
firewall
but
the
cause
was
not
clear
yet
the
team
are
working
flat
we
feel
the
pain
for
our
customers
every
time
this
happens
he
said
the
rbs
outage
on
friday
also
affected
natwest
rbs
s
most
highly
rated
brand
among
customers
the
lender
used
twitter
to
apologise
to
customers
and
said
telephone
banking
and
atms
were
working
as
normal
many
customers
took
to
social
media
to
complain
about
the
outage
so
how
do
you
expect
me
to
pay
my
bills
today
when
i
work
natalie
wilkinson
said
in
a
tweet
to
natwest
asking
other
users
to
recommend
a
more
reliable
bank
the
consequences
for
banks
of
online
banking
problems
and
the
subsequent
scrutiny
of
those
failings
by
politicians
can
be
severe
earlier
this
year
a
major
outage
at
lender
tsb
owned
by
spain
s
sabadell
left
thousands
of
customers
unable
to
access
their
money
or
make
vital
payments
for
long
periods
tsb
chief
executive
paul
pester
resigned
this
month
following
heavy
criticism
by
the
treasury
committee
and
the
bank
s
customers
for
his
handling
of
the
crisis
british
banks
do
not
have
long
to
strengthen
their
contingency
plans
for
when
online
banking
services
fail
the
bank
of
england
and
the
financial
conduct
authority
in
july
set
a
deadline
of
for
british
lenders
to
explain
how
they
can
avoid
damaging
it
breakdowns
and
respond
to
the
growing
threat
of
cyber
attacks
