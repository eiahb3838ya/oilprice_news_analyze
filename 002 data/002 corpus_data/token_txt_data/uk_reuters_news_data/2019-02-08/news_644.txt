this
week
s
fatal
shooting
of
people
in
a
california
bar
by
a
marine
combat
veteran
came
the
day
after
the
election
of
a
new
democratic
governor
who
has
pushed
for
tighter
gun
control
in
the
state
which
already
has
some
of
the
strictest
firearms
laws
in
the
country
ian
david
long
used
a
caliber
glock
handgun
equipped
with
a
magazine
to
mow
down
patrons
late
on
wednesday
in
the
bar
and
dance
hall
filled
with
college
students
authorities
said
the
shooting
raised
questions
about
the
efficacy
of
existing
gun
safety
laws
as
gavin
newsom
a
lieutenant
governor
closely
aligned
with
gun
control
advocates
prepares
to
take
the
helm
in
the
most
populous
state
following
his
election
victory
on
tuesday
he
s
been
such
a
champion
on
this
issue
so
we
expect
to
see
more
innovation
from
the
legislators
and
approved
by
gavin
newsom
said
laura
cutilletta
legal
director
of
the
giffords
law
center
to
prevent
gun
violence
by
champion
she
was
referring
to
the
former
san
francisco
mayor
s
avid
support
of
gun
safety
regulations
two
years
ago
newsom
a
gun
control
ballot
initiative
that
sought
to
extend
the
state
s
ban
on
the
sale
and
transfer
of
magazines
to
include
those
owned
before
the
original
legislation
passed
in
went
into
effect
those
magazines
were
grandfathered
into
the
law
newsom
s
measure
was
challenged
in
a
lawsuit
supported
by
the
national
rifle
association
and
the
courts
put
on
hold
the
provision
relating
to
magazines
newsom
on
thursday
vowed
to
push
for
even
stricter
laws
though
he
provided
no
specifics
he
signalled
a
shift
from
outgoing
governor
jerry
brown
also
a
democrat
who
vetoed
numerous
gun
control
measures
including
a
bill
to
tighten
the
state
s
law
against
assault
weapons
the
response
is
not
just
prayers
the
said
at
a
news
conference
on
thursday
referring
to
the
shooting
at
the
borderline
bar
and
grill
in
thousand
oaks
miles
km
northwest
of
los
angeles
the
response
can
not
just
be
excuses
the
response
sure
as
hell
can
not
be
more
magazines
allow
shooters
to
unleash
prolonged
torrents
of
bullets
and
reduce
the
need
to
gun
rights
advocates
have
argued
that
such
magazines
help
people
defend
their
homes
from
intruders
but
gun
safety
supporters
say
banning
them
would
force
perpetrators
of
mass
shootings
to
pause
and
reload
creating
an
opening
for
law
enforcement
to
respond
it
was
not
immediately
clear
how
or
when
long
obtained
his
gun
and
magazine
he
was
a
small
child
when
california
banned
the
sale
of
magazines
and
would
not
have
been
able
to
legally
own
a
gun
or
ammunition
said
chuck
michel
a
lawyer
representing
gun
owners
challenging
california
s
ban
long
he
said
could
have
easily
gone
to
another
state
to
purchase
a
magazine
for
his
glock
he
also
could
have
stolen
one
numerous
other
states
including
colorado
connecticut
hawaii
maryland
massachusetts
new
jersey
new
york
vermont
and
washington
