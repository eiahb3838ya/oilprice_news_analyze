eu
brexit
negotiator
michel
barnier
rejected
key
elements
of
britain
s
new
trade
proposals
on
thursday
even
as
he
and
his
new
british
counterpart
dominic
raab
voiced
a
shared
determination
to
reach
a
deal
by
october
at
a
joint
news
conference
with
the
brexit
secretary
after
three
days
of
talks
among
officials
in
brussels
barnier
made
clear
british
offers
to
collect
customs
duties
for
the
eu
as
part
of
efforts
to
avoid
friction
on
northern
ireland
s
new
eu
border
had
failed
to
convince
already
skeptical
europeans
the
eu
can
not
and
will
not
delegate
the
application
of
its
customs
policy
and
rules
vat
and
excise
duty
collection
to
a
who
would
not
be
subject
to
the
eu
s
governance
structures
barnier
said
any
customs
arrangements
or
customs
union
must
respect
this
the
uk
wants
to
take
back
control
of
its
money
law
and
borders
we
will
respect
that
he
said
but
the
eu
also
wants
to
keep
control
of
its
money
law
and
borders
the
uk
should
respect
barnier
added
that
prime
minister
theresa
may
might
instead
offer
to
join
a
customs
union
with
the
eu
although
that
would
prevent
london
cutting
its
own
trade
deals
with
other
countries
may
has
ruled
out
a
customs
union
and
raab
said
britain
still
believed
it
could
reach
a
deal
to
avoid
a
hard
border
negotiations
to
provide
an
outline
of
how
trade
will
work
between
britain
and
the
eu
after
brexit
next
march
and
more
particularly
after
the
end
of
a
status
quo
transition
in
have
become
tangled
up
with
resolving
the
irish
question
which
brussels
says
must
be
done
in
a
withdrawal
treaty
raab
said
his
officials
had
answered
eu
counterparts
concerns
on
the
customs
plan
part
of
a
white
paper
which
may
pushed
through
her
cabinet
at
the
expense
of
the
resignation
of
raab
s
predecessor
and
fellow
brexit
campaigner
david
davis
at
the
heart
of
the
conundrum
lies
an
eu
insistence
that
the
way
to
avoid
a
hard
border
is
for
northern
ireland
to
follow
eu
rules
as
in
ireland
and
if
need
be
different
from
those
on
the
british
mainland
while
may
rejects
new
barriers
to
goods
moving
from
the
mainland
to
the
troubled
province
raab
said
he
believed
a
backstop
clause
in
the
treaty
on
ireland
could
be
agreed
though
he
said
britain
would
insist
it
was
not
valid
forever
something
barnier
says
it
must
be
in
case
britain
s
promised
better
proposals
do
not
work
with
pragmatism
on
both
sides
i
am
confident
we
can
find
a
way
to
resolve
it
into
a
workable
solution
and
that
will
be
easier
to
achieve
if
the
backstop
if
it
were
to
be
exercised
at
all
could
only
be
for
a
period
before
the
future
arrangements
become
operational
raab
told
reporters
barnier
however
said
the
talks
this
week
had
failed
to
convince
him
we
have
no
objections
in
principle
to
this
he
said
of
what
he
calls
an
backstop
but
he
added
we
have
doubts
that
it
can
be
done
without
putting
at
risk
the
integrity
of
our
customs
union
our
common
commercial
policy
our
regulatory
policy
and
our
fiscal
revenue
we
have
had
an
open
and
frank
and
therefore
useful
discussion
with
dominic
on
these
issues
i
think
the
uk
has
understood
our
concerns
and
respects
our
principles
and
the
uk
had
promised
to
come
back
to
us
with
concrete
proposals
on
how
to
address
our
both
men
said
negotiations
would
resume
in
normally
a
time
when
the
eu
institutions
are
closed
for
summer
holidays
and
would
continue
weekly
thereafter
