murray true to word with second round exit at u.s. open
new
york
reuters
andy
murray
lived
up
to
his
prediction
that
he
would
not
win
this
year
s
open
when
he
was
beaten
by
spain
s
fernando
verdasco
in
the
second
round
on
wednesday
the
number
one
and
open
champion
who
is
still
working
his
way
back
from
hip
surgery
and
had
earlier
downplayed
his
chances
battled
verdasco
for
nearly
three
hours
and
minutes
before
finally
surrendering
on
a
fourth
match
point
while
trying
to
force
a
fifth
set
i
think
some
of
the
tennis
i
played
today
was
some
of
the
best
i
ve
played
since
i
had
the
surgery
or
since
i
came
back
said
murray
but
there
were
also
periods
in
the
match
especially
in
the
first
set
where
i
really
didn
t
play
particularly
well
then
kind
of
at
the
end
when
my
back
was
against
the
wall
i
came
up
with
some
good
tennis
to
make
it
close
and
playing
in
just
his
fifth
event
since
hip
surgery
in
january
what
murray
lacked
in
sharpness
he
more
than
made
up
for
in
gritty
determination
as
the
battled
through
a
gruelling
opening
set
that
lasted
minutes
drenched
in
sweat
murray
slowly
began
to
find
his
comfort
zone
in
the
sauna
like
conditions
taking
the
second
to
level
the
match
but
verdasco
would
not
be
rattled
and
dominated
large
chunks
of
play
until
the
end
of
the
clash
when
murray
dug
in
and
the
seeded
spaniard
struggled
to
seal
the
match
it
was
tough
of
course
to
close
the
match
said
verdasco
after
collecting
just
his
second
win
in
matches
against
murray
and
his
first
in
nine
years
with
andy
it
is
always
tough
he
is
an
unbelievable
verdasco
will
face
yet
another
open
champion
in
the
third
round
in
argentine
juan
martin
del
potro
who
was
a
winner
over
american
denis
kudla
murray
meanwhile
leaves
flushing
meadows
with
all
signs
pointing
he
is
headed
in
the
right
direction
it
s
still
quite
early
in
this
process
for
me
said
murray
i
did
all
right
i
chased
balls
down
right
to
the
end
of
the
match
i
wasn
t
giving
up
on
points
but
you
just
don
t
know
exactly
what
s
round
the
corner
if
things
keep
going
smoothly
physically
i
continue
to
improve
i
believe
that
i
will
get
back
to
competing
for
the
biggest
competitions
because
there
s
no
reason
why
i
couldn
t
but
you
don
t
