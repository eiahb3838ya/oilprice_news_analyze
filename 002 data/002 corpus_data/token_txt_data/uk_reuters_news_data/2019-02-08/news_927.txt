'chuck chequers', johnson challenges may on brexit
birmingham
england
reuters
former
british
foreign
minister
boris
johnson
set
out
his
stall
to
the
conservative
party
faithful
on
tuesday
stopping
just
short
of
an
outright
leadership
bid
to
replace
prime
minister
theresa
may
but
tearing
into
her
brexit
blueprint
to
standing
ovations
cheers
and
laughter
johnson
may
s
most
powerful
critic
in
her
governing
party
said
her
chequers
plan
to
leave
the
european
union
was
a
cheat
that
would
leave
britain
locked
in
the
tractor
beam
of
brussels
but
may
who
did
not
watch
her
former
minister
again
showed
little
sign
of
shifting
away
from
her
chequers
plan
to
keep
close
ties
with
the
eu
after
brexit
the
biggest
shift
in
british
foreign
and
trade
policy
for
more
than
years
with
just
six
months
before
britain
leaves
the
eu
may
s
precarious
position
at
the
helm
of
her
party
has
been
further
shaken
by
criticism
of
her
chequers
plan
named
after
her
country
residence
at
home
and
in
brussels
johnson
the
figurehead
for
the
campaign
to
leave
the
eu
and
the
bookmakers
favourite
to
replace
may
has
become
the
loudest
critic
warning
conservatives
that
if
they
supported
chequers
they
could
be
signing
up
to
the
party
s
electoral
death
but
despite
seeming
to
rally
party
members
to
his
cause
by
calling
on
conservatives
to
return
to
their
traditional
values
he
disappointed
some
supporters
by
saying
he
would
stick
by
may
at
least
for
now
if
we
get
it
wrong
if
we
bottle
brexit
now
believe
me
the
people
of
this
country
will
find
it
hard
to
forgive
johnson
told
the
hundreds
of
conservatives
who
queued
to
get
a
seat
in
a
hall
just
across
from
the
main
venue
where
may
will
address
the
party
s
annual
conference
on
wednesday
do
not
believe
that
we
can
somehow
get
it
wrong
now
bodge
it
now
and
fix
it
later
he
said
to
cheers
this
is
the
moment
to
chuck
chequers
he
said
if
we
cheat
the
electorate
and
chequers
is
a
cheat
we
will
escalate
that
sense
of
may
has
shown
little
sign
of
moving
away
from
her
blueprint
and
had
tried
to
put
on
a
show
of
unity
at
her
party
conference
in
the
central
english
city
of
birmingham
but
her
bid
to
revitalise
her
domestic
agenda
and
steal
the
initiative
from
the
main
opposition
labour
party
has
been
overshadowed
by
the
party
splits
over
brexit
she
told
the
bbc
she
was
a
bit
cross
with
johnson
but
only
because
his
alternative
brexit
proposals
would
she
said
tear
up
the
united
kingdom
by
forcing
northern
ireland
to
operate
separately
from
the
rest
of
the
uk
boris
always
puts
on
a
good
show
but
what
matters
to
people
is
what
we
are
delivering
for
them
on
the
things
that
affect
their
day
to
day
lives
she
told
sky
news
other
ministers
chimed
in
with
justice
minister
david
gauke
doubting
whether
johnson
s
credentials
for
leadership
now
is
a
time
for
a
credible
and
serious
plan
and
credible
and
serious
leadership
we
have
that
from
theresa
may
i
think
there
are
others
who
would
struggle
to
provide
that
type
of
leadership
gauke
said
some
of
johnson
s
supporters
while
welcoming
his
speech
said
they
believed
now
was
not
the
time
to
launch
a
leadership
bid
against
may
he
is
absolutely
right
about
the
threat
that
chequers
poses
to
our
democracy
our
country
and
ultimately
the
fortunes
of
the
conservative
party
if
we
stick
with
it
andrew
bridgen
a
conservative
lawmaker
said
am
i
disappointed
that
he
didn
t
declare
no
because
i
think
we
probably
can
t
have
the
of
a
leadership
but
while
johnson
may
be
holding
his
fire
on
the
leadership
for
now
he
gave
both
barrels
to
may
s
brexit
plan
and
set
out
his
vision
for
the
conservative
party
one
that
returned
to
its
traditional
values
of
low
taxes
and
a
strong
police
namechecking
margaret
thatcher
the
prime
minister
from
to
who
remains
a
hero
to
many
in
the
party
he
called
on
the
party
to
build
more
houses
and
while
courting
business
he
struck
out
at
bankers
over
the
financial
crisis
it
was
a
great
speech
he
was
optimistic
he
talked
about
conservative
values
and
he
talked
about
the
opportunities
if
we
do
brexit
properly

said
after
johnson
s
speech
i
think
the
whole
country
will
be
listening
and
the
whole
country
will
be
saying
here
is
a
guy
that
was
deeply
involved
in
securing
brexit
in
the
first
place
who
is
basically
saying
that
chequers
is
a
constitutional
outrage
