dublin
reuters
northern
ireland
s
largest
irish
nationalist
party
sinn
fein
stepped
up
calls
on
wednesday
for
a
split
from
the
united
kingdom
saying
a
referendum
on
irish
unity
should
be
held
in
the
event
of
a
no
deal
brexit
sinn
fein
has
been
regularly
calling
for
a
vote
for
northern
ireland
to
leave
the
uk
and
unite
with
the
republic
of
ireland
since
britain
voted
to
leave
the
european
union
in
while
most
voters
in
northern
ireland
voted
to
remain
however
its
leader
mary
lou
mcdonald
raised
the
demand
for
the
second
successive
day
in
the
dublin
parliament
where
separate
to
their
colleagues
in
the
devolved
assembly
in
belfast
its
lawmakers
make
up
the
third
largest
party
a
crash
out
brexit
will
be
catastrophic
for
our
island
it
will
rupture
our
economy
our
social
fabric
and
our
peace
accords
so
the
contingency
planning
required
goes
well
beyond
the
recruitment
of
additional
officials
mcdonald
told
irish
prime
minister
leo
varadkar
in
the
event
of
a
no
deal
situation
arriving
it
is
the
strong
view
of
sinn
fein
that
a
referendum
on
unity
must
be
advanced
as
a
matter
of
urgency
and
varadkar
dismissed
the
timing
of
sinn
fein
s
call
as
destructive
and
disruptive
a
day
after
mcdonald
said
she
raised
it
in
a
telephone
call
with
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
whom
she
said
also
disagreed
with
her
i
don
t
believe
now
is
the
time
for
us
to
start
talking
about
border
polls
varadkar
said
under
a
peace
deal
that
ended
years
of
sectarian
violence
in
the
province
the
british
government
can
call
a
referendum
if
it
appears
likely
a
majority
of
those
voting
would
seek
to
form
part
of
a
united
ireland
a
newspaper
poll
on
friday
showed
that
if
there
was
a
referendum
next
year
percent
of
voters
would
definitely
vote
for
a
united
ireland
if
britain
leaves
the
eu
on
the
terms
theresa
may
is
currently
proposing
but
that
would
rise
to
percent
if
britain
quit
the
bloc
without
a
deal
the
pollsters
said
the
opposition
to
holding
a
referendum
was
driven
by
unionists
who
want
northern
ireland
to
remain
part
of
the
uk
with
the
province
s
irish
nationalists
leading
calls
for
a
vote
when
deferring
a
parliamentary
vote
on
her
deal
this
week
may
told
lawmakers
that
if
they
cared
about
preserving
the
union
between
england
scotland
wales
and
northern
ireland
they
should
listen
to
the
people
of
northern
ireland
who
she
said
supported
her
deal
