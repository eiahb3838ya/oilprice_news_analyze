new
tariffs
on
billion
billion
pounds
worth
of
goods
less
than
hours
after
president
donald
trump
imposed
percent
tariffs
on
an
additional
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
having
shrugged
off
the
move
in

though
as
it

the

investors
and
analysts
had
been
perplexed
by
early
market
moves
which
shrugged
off
washington
s
escalation
of
the
tariff
spat
waging
between
the
and
china
mark
haefele
chief
investment
officer
at
ubs
wealth
management
highlighted
how
important
chinese
retaliation
was
to
the
outlook
for
markets
a
round
of
retaliation
would
likely
be
taken
positively
by
the
market
reducing
the
risk
of
a
significant
escalation
in
the
conflict
he
wrote
in
a
note
explaining
the
market
s
sanguine
reaction
earlier
neil
wilson
chief
market
analyst
at
said
on
tuesday
the
fine
print
of
the
new
tariffs
could
also
be
seen
as
providing
some
relief
exemptions
have
turned
this
into
something
of
a
sell
the
rumour
buy
the
fact
type
scenario
for
investors
he
said
thomas
costerg
senior
economist
at
pictet
said
ahead
of
the
trade
announcement
that
investors
might
well
take
the
view
that
the
trump
administration
had
shown
some
restraint
as
it
could
have
imposed
even
higher
tariffs
ten
percent
could
actually
come
as
a
relief
he
said
adding
that
such
a
figure
would
be
bad
but
manageable
on
the
corporate
front
dealmaking
prompted
steep
moves
across
european
bourses
the
top
gainer

ending
the
day
up
percent
after
a
media
report
that
private
equity
funds
are
studying
a
potential
takeover
bid
while
we
acknowledge
that
the
decelerating
performance
continues
to
be
worrying
pandora
is
still
a
relatively
strong
business
which
we
believe
could
be
turned
around
should
management
be
replaced
