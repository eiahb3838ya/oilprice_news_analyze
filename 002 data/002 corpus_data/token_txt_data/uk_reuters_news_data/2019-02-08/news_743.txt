brazil leftist's hopes of catching bolsonaro slim, but gap narrows
paulo
reuters
the
chances
of
brazil
s
leftist
presidential
candidate
fernando
haddad
narrowing
the
lead
of
jair
bolsonaro
took
a
hit
when
he
failed
to
win
a
crucial
endorsement
on
saturday
a
day
before
the
two
face
off
in
a
runoff
election
however
polls
published
late
saturday
from
brazil
s
two
biggest
surveying
firms
showed
momentum
shifting
toward
haddad
though
he
still
trails
bolsonaro
by
a
solid
margin
former
candidate
ciro
gomes
said
in
a
video
on
social
media
that
he
would
not
take
sides
in
the
election
campaign
withholding
support
for
haddad
of
the
workers
party
pt
gomes
a
former
governor
of
ceará
state
in
the
northeast
is
influential
in
brazil
s
poorest
region
his
endorsement
could
have
given
haddad
a
big
lift
in
the
south
american
country
s
most
polarized
election
in
a
generation
but
rodrigo
janot
brazil
s
influential
former
prosecutor
general
under
whose
watch
the
country
s
unprecedented
investigations
and
prosecutions
of
endemic
political
graft
took
place
tweeted
late
saturday
that
he
would
vote
for
haddad
that
was
a
blow
to
bolsonaro
s
work
positioning
himself
as
the
only
candidate
i
think
we
are
at
the
brink
of
a
process
that
could
push
our
democracy
beyond
its
limits
janot
told
reuters
late
saturday
freedom
equality
and
fraternity
always
and
at
any
haddad
narrowed
bolsonaro
s
lead
to
percentage
points
in
an
ibope
poll
released
late
saturday
a
survey
that
gave
him
percent
compared
with
bolsonaro
s
percent
as
only
two
candidates
remain
and
those
figures
discard
voters
who
say
they
will
annul
their
votes
that
in
practice
means
haddad
needs
to
win
percentage
points
to
overtake
the
in
a
datafolha
poll
also
released
late
saturday
bolsonaro
had
percent
of
voter
backing
compared
with
percent
for
haddad
while
haddad
failed
to
get
gomes
to
endorse
him
he
won
the
backing
on
saturday
not
just
of
janot
but
of
brazil
s
most
popular
youtube
host
felipe
neto
who
has
million
followers
on
his
channel
a
popular
judge
joaquim
barbosa
who
jailed
several
top
pt
leaders
for
corruption
also
came
out
for
haddad
gomes
finished
third
in
the
first
round
vote
with
percent
of
the
vote
behind
bolsonaro
s
percent
and
haddad
s
percent
gomes
had
hoped
to
be
the
standard
bearer
of
the
left
but
was
outmanoeuvred
by
jailed
pt
leader
luiz
inacio
lula
da
silva
who
is
serving
a
prison
sentence
for
corruption
and
anointed
haddad
as
his
bolsonaro
a
former
army
captain
is
poised
to
become
brazil
s
first
president
since
the
end
of
the
military
dictatorship
the
congressman
has
promised
to
crack
down
on
crime
and
corruption
pitching
himself
as
the
candidate
for
voters
fed
up
with
political
graft
and
violent
crime
bolsonaro
s
sudden
rise
comes
as
brazil
finds
itself
in
its
worst
recession
and
embroiled
in
its
biggest
corruption
scandal
after
the
leftist
pt
ran
the
government
for
of
the
last
years
until
his
presidential
run
bolsonaro
was
best
known
for
defending
the
former
military
regime
and
its
use
of
torture
he
has
faced
charges
for
misogynist
racist
and
homophobic
rants
the
supreme
court
rejected
the
racism
charge
but
has
not
ruled
on
a
charge
of
inciting
to
rape
in
a
case
in
which
he
told
a
fellow
lawmaker
she
was
not
pretty
enough
to
rape
he
called
the
case
political
persecution
a
week
ago
bolsonaro
vowed
to
run
all
the
red
leftists
out
of
brazil
or
put
them
in
jail
harsh
words
that
probably
contributed
to
the
narrowing
of
his
lead
youtuber
neto
said
he
had
been
neutral
until
that
point
everything
changed
when
bolsonaro
said
he
will
sweep
opponents
out
of
the
country
or
into
jail
in
years
of
pt
i
have
been
robbed
but
never
threatened
neto
said
by
twitter
in
the
final
two
days
of
campaigning
bolsonaro
has
sounded
more
moderate
in
his
statements
backing
down
on
a
plan
to
follow
president
donald
trump
s
example
and
pull
brazil
out
of
the
paris
climate
change
accord
on
friday
he
told
xingú
tribes
people
they
had
a
right
to
charge
royalties
for
mining
and
hydro
electric
power
generation
on
their
reservations
a
proposal
welcomed
by
some
natives
but
rejected
by
anthropologists
and
environmentalists
who
see
the
tribes
as
the
last
guardians
of
the
amazon
rainforest
and
its
biodiversity
you
are
as
brazilian
as
any
of
us
he
said
in
a
video
posted
on
social
media
i
want
you
to
have
the
right
to
use
your
land
and
exploit
its
biodiversity
and
mineral
in
his
final
hours
of
campaigning
in
sao
paulo
haddad
accused
the
bolsonaro
camp
of
sweetening
their
candidate
to
make
him
appear
what
he
is
not
he
is
a
truculent
and
dangerous
person
and
that
s
how
he
should
be
presented
to
the
