said

swing

surging
to
victory
over
a

approval
rating
of

datafolha
poll
tuesday
he
has
also
yet
to
build
a
base
in
congress
where
he
has
eschewed
the
political
that
traditionally
helped
brazilian
presidents
govern
as
a
result
he
may
have
an
uphill
battle
to
enact
his
agenda
which
includes
austerity
measures
to
bring
down
an
unsustainable
budget
deficit
of
about

reduce
the
deficit
and
restore
confidence
and
growth
to
