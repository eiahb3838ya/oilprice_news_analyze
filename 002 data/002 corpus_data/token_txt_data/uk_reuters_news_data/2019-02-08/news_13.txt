introduced
the
bill
one
day
before
the
deadline
for
president
donald
trump
s
administration
to
submit
a
report
to
congress
on
whether
saudi
crown
prince
mohamed

ordered
khashoggi
s
killing
congressional
aides
said
they
had
been
given
no
indication
that
the
administration
would
meet
that
deadline
the
white
house
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
meanwhile
a
united
inquiry
into
the
khashoggi
s
murder
said
on
thursday
that
evidence
pointed
to
a
brutal
crime
planned
and
perpetrated
by
saudi
officials
among
other
things
the
saudi
arabia
accountability
and
yemen
act
of
would
impose
mandatory
sanctions
on
anyone
found
responsible
for
the
death
of
khashoggi
a
resident
and
columnist
for
the
washington
post
menendez
graham
and
other
lawmakers
had
tried
to
pass
similar
legislation
last
year
during
the
previous
congress
but
it
failed
to
advance
the
senate
did
unanimously
pass
a
resolution
blaming
bin
salman
for
khashoggi
s
killing
and
a
measure
that
would
have
barred
support
for
the
coalition
waging
war
in
yemen
however
the
republicans
who
then
led
the
house
of
representatives
did
not
allow
a
vote
on
the
legislation
trump
has
resisted
legislative
efforts
to
rebuke
the
saudis
pointing
to
weapons
sales
as
an
important
source
of
jobs
his
administration
is
also
reluctant
to
disturb
the
strategic
relationship
with
the
kingdom
seen
as
an
important
regional
counterbalance
to
iran
of
ally
israel
graham
a
close
trump
ally
who
nonetheless
has
led
the
push
for
a
strong
response
to
saudi
arabia
said
he
expected
strong
bipartisan
support
for
serious
while
saudi
arabia
is
a
strategic
ally
the
behaviour
of
the
crown
prince
in
multiple
ways
has
shown
disrespect
for
the
relationship
and
made
him
in
my
view
beyond
toxic
graham
said
in
a
statement
i
fully
realise
we
have
to
deal
with
bad
actors
and
imperfect
situations
on
the
international
stage
however
when
we
lose
our
moral
voice
we
lose
our
strongest
asset
graham
added
democrats
now
control
the
house
and
have
been
more
open
to
legislation
penalizing
saudi
arabia
the
chairman
of
the
house
foreign
affairs
committee
held
a
hearing
on
relations
with
saudi
arabia
on
wednesday
where
he
opened
the
door
to
new
restrictions
on
weapons
exports
to
the
kingdom
besides
putting
new
limits
on
weapons
sales
the
senate
legislation
announced
on
thursday
would
bar
refuelling
of
aircraft
for
the
coalition
engaged
in
the
civil
war
in
yemen
it
would
also
impose
sanctions
on
anyone
blocking
humanitarian
assistance
in
yemen
sanction
anyone
supporting
the
houthi
rebels
fighting
yemen
s
internationally
recognised
government
demand
an
accountability
report
for
anyone
involved
in
the
yemen
conflict
who
commits
war
crimes
and
mandate
a
report
on
human
rights
in
saudi
arabia
seeing
as
the
trump
administration
has
no
intention
of
insisting
on
full
accountability
for
khashoggi
s
murderers
it
is
time
for
congress
to
step
in
and
impose
real
consequences
to
fundamentally
reexamine
our
relationship
with
the
kingdom
of
saudi
arabia
and
with
the
coalition
in
yemen
