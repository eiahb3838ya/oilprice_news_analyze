reuters
the
kremlin
on
thursday
said
a
new
batch
of
sanctions
on
moscow
announced
by
the
united
states
was
illegal
under
international
law
and
that
russia
s
financial
system
was
stable
washington
said
on
wednesday
it
was
imposing
fresh
sanctions
on
russia
by
the
end
of
august
after
determining
that
moscow
had
used
a
nerve
agent
against
a
former
russian
agent
and
his
daughter
in
britain
something
the
kremlin
denies
kremlin
spokesman
dmitry
peskov
speaking
to
reporters
on
a
conference
call
said
the
move
was
absolutely
unfriendly
but
said
moscow
continued
to
hope
that
for
an
improvement
in
battered
relations
making
a
linking
to
these
events
the
british
poisoning
is
for
us
unacceptable
and
such
restrictions
like
those
passed
by
the
american
side
earlier
are
absolutely
illegal
and
do
not
correspond
to
international
law
said
peskov
news
of
the
measures
sent
the
rouble
tumbling
to
lows
at
one
point
and
sparked
a
wider
asset
over
fears
that
moscow
was
locked
in
a
spiral
of
sanctions
