tehran says trump wrong to expect saudis to cover loss of iran oil supply
london
reuters
iran
said
on
tuesday
president
donald
trump
was
mistaken
to
expect
saudi
arabia
and
other
oil
producers
to
compensate
for
supply
losses
caused
by
sanctions
on
iran
after
opec
production
rose
only
modestly
in
july
the
comments
from
iran
s
opec
governor
came
a
day
after
a
reuters
survey
showed
opec
production
rose
by
barrels
per
day
in
july
saudi
production
increased
but
was
offset
by
a
decline
in
iranian
supply
due
to
the
restart
of
sanctions
the
survey
found
it
seems
president
trump
has
been
taken
hostage
by
saudi
arabia
and
a
few
producers
when
they
claimed
they
can
replace
million
barrels
per
day
of
iranian
exports
encouraging
him
to
take
action
against
iran
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
told
reuters
now
they
and
russia
sell
more
oil
and
more
expensively
not
even
from
their
incremental
production
but
their
he
said
oil
prices
which
trump
has
been
pressuring
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
to
bring
down
by
raising
output
will
rise
unless
the
united
states
grants
waivers
to
buyers
of
iranian
crude
they
are
also
calling
for
the
use
of
the
spr
strategic
petroleum
reserve
this
will
also
mean
higher
prices
waivers
to
our
clients
if
they
come
is
due
to
the
failure
of
bluffers
saudi
and
the
other
producers
and
if
not
given
will
again
push
the
prices
higher
he
said
so
they
hanged
him
trump
on
the
wall
now
they
want
to
have
a
mega
opec
congratulations
to
president
trump
russia
and
saudi
opec
governors
represent
their
respective
country
on
the
organisation
s
board
of
governors
and
are
typically
the
second
most
senior
person
in
a
country
s
opec
delegation
after
the
oil
minister
the
solution
mr
president
is
to
support
and
facilitate
capacity
building
in
all
countries
proportionate
to
their
reserves
of
oil
and
gas
and
we
will
remain
the
biggest
opportunity
