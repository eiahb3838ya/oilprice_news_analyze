the
bounce
didn
t
signal
a
sudden
change
of
mind
from
the
market
over
the
challenges
facing
housebuilders
in
an
economy
hurt
by
the
decision
to
exit
the
european
union
but
rather
an
acknowledgement
that
they
may
not
have
much
further
to
fall

housebuilders
shares
are
currently
pricing
in
cuts
of
to
percent
barclays
analysts
wrote
in
a
note
on
wednesday
which
they
said
reflects
a
fall
of
up
to
percent
in
house
prices
and
a
percent
reduction
in
transactions
in
the
housing
market
in
the
bank
of
england
s
disorderly
brexit
scenario
the
central
bank
said
house
prices
could
fall
by
percent
what
some
see
as
a
higher
probability
of
tuesday
s
vote
ultimately
yielding
a
no
brexit
outcome
also
helped
boost
the
shares
which
have
been
under
pressure
since
the
brexit
vote
jp
morgan
analysts
upped
their
estimated
probability
of
no
brexit
to
percent
from
percent
on
wednesday
speculation
the
bank
of
england
would
step
in
to
support
housebuilders
could
also
be
helping
them
people
might
well
think
that
the
government
will
pump
money
into
the
economy
in
which
case
construction
and
housebuilding
are
fairly
obvious
areas
to
go

at
cavendish
asset
management
with
valuations
nearly
at
their
lows
hit
just
after
the
brexit
vote
and
dividend
yields
among
the
highest
in
the
ftse
housebuilders
also
look
attractive
to
income
investors
willing
to
