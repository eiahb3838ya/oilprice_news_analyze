london
reuters
britain
s
royal
mail
apologised
on
friday
after
historians
pointed
out
that
a
stamp
design
it
planned
to
issue
to
commemorate
the
landings
in
france
in
fact
showed
troops
going
ashore
thousands
of
miles
away
weeks
earlier
the
stamp
part
of
a
series
of
to
mark
the
anniversary
of
the
june
landings
was
part
of
a
special
programme
for
to
showcase
the
best
of
british
the
stamp
issue
will
be
a
timely
commemoration
of
all
those
who
participated
and
will
use
images
from
the
day
itself
the
royal
mail
said
before
the
blunder
was
revealed
however
after
a
preview
of
the
stamp
was
put
on
the
royal
mail
s
twitter
feed
historians
and
others
noticed
that
it
actually
showed
troops
wading
ashore
in
may
in
dutch
new
guinea
now
indonesia
from
a
landing
craft
that
was
not
involved
in
the
landings
we
sincerely
apologise
that
our
special
stamp
preview
included
a
design
which
had
been
incorrectly
associated
with
the
landings
royal
mail
said
on
twitter
this
stamp
design
has
not
been
printed
we
would
like
to
reassure
our
customers
that
this
image
will
not
be
part
of
the
final
this
story
has
been
corrected
in
the
first
paragraph
to
show
troops
landed
weeks
not
months
earlier
