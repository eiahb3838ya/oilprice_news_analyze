reuters
the
european
union
can
offer
britain
more
assurances
over
the
irish
border
backstop
in
a
political
declaration
on
ties
if
london
moves
towards
accepting
a
permanent
customs
union
a
leading
eu
lawmaker
dealing
with
brexit
said
danuta
hubner
spoke
to
reuters
as
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
headed
back
to
brussels
to
demand
the
renegotiation
of
the
legal
withdrawal
treaty
she
agreed
with
the
eu
but
can
not
get
ratified
at
home
may
wants
to
replace
the
emergency
irish
border
fix
with
unspecified
alternative
arrangements
to
ensure
no
return
of
extensive
border
checks
on
the
island
of
ireland
something
the
eu
says
is
vague
and
not
enough
of
a
guarantee
alternative
arrangements
relates
to
the
future
what
can
be
added
or
changed
in
the
political
declaration
is
to
ensure
some
new
arrangements
that
would
solve
the
issue
of
a
hard
border
hubner
said
on
wednesday
evening
key
to
this
is
the
conversation
with
corbyn
dialogue
must
yield
some
new
elements
for
the
future
the
only
thing
we
have
not
yet
tried
is
a
shift
of
the
uk
s
red
lines
she
said
of
may
s
talks
with
opposition
leader
jeremy
corbyn
corbyn
wants
britain
to
be
in
a
permanent
customs
union
with
the
eu
after
brexit
something
may
has
opposed
so
far
as
it
would
hinder
britain
s
ability
to
pursue
independent
trade
deals
around
the
world
if
there
is
no
openness
on
the
uk
side
to
include
those
assurances
in
the
political
declaration
on
the
future
ties
the
process
could
mechanically
take
us
to
the
political
declaration
is
a
binding
document
that
accompanies
the
legally
binding
withdrawal
deal
negotiated
by
the
eu
and
may
s
government
the
british
parliament
resoundingly
rejected
that
deal
two
weeks
ago
and
has
told
may
to
reopen
negotiations
with
the
eu
on
it
hubner
said
the
eu
would
not
blink
on
refusing
to
renegotiate
the
withdrawal
agreement
or
replacing
the
backstop
a
step
further
would
risk
undermining
the
single
market
if
the
single
market
loses
its
integrity
it
would
be
the
end
of
the
eu
she
said
it
s
not
just
about
the
risk
of
brexit
