the
european
union
s
executive
said
on
wednesday
the
bloc
would
do
its
utmost
to
avoid
extensive
border
controls
between
eu
member
state
ireland
and
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
regardless
of
how
brexit
goes
a
spokesman
said
the
irish
border
issue
remains
the
biggest
obstacle
to
a
divorce
deal
being
agreed
between
britain
and
the
eu
in
the
countdown
to
brexit
which
is
scheduled
for
march
the
eu
is
determined
to
do
all
it
can
deal
or
no
to
avoid
a
hard
border
in
ireland
the
commission
s
chief
spokesman
margaritis
schinas
told
a
news
conference
on
tuesday
schinas
said
a
brexit
would
automatically
erect
a
border
on
the
island
of
ireland
putting
dublin
on
the
spot
as
to
what
preparations
it
was
making
for
a
scenario
all
sides
say
they
want
to
avoid
an
irish
government
spokesman
reacted
on
tuesday
by
saying
dublin
would
not
accept
a
hard
border
which
is
seen
as
possibly
endangering
peace
on
the
island
and
was
not
planning
for
one
on
wednesday
schinas
reaffirmed
eu
solidarity
with
dublin
but
also
noted
that
the
irish
border
would
become
an
external
border
of
the
eu
after
brexit
that
meant
policing
the
frontier
properly
if
there
is
no
alternative
arrangements
with
britain
in
the
case
of
a
brexit
ireland
and
the
eu
have
responsibilities
as
regards
the
protection
of
the
single
market
and
the
customs
union
schinas
said
speaking
in
the
polish
city
of
krakow
on
wednesday
the
commission
s
first
frans
timmermans
reiterated
that
the
eu
could
not
renegotiate
the
backstop
agreement
in
the
withdrawal
deal
negotiated
by
brussels
and
london
the
backstop
is
an
insurance
policy
designed
to
ensure
there
is
no
return
to
customs
and
other
extensive
border
checks
between
ireland
and
northern
ireland
after
brexit
the
british
parliament
resoundingly
rejected
the
withdrawal
deal
last
week
mainly
due
to
concerns
over
the
backstop
fearing
it
would
commit
the
uk
to
eu
customs
rules
after
brexit
may
is
now
trying
to
secure
further
eu
concessions
on
the
backstop
to
overcome
opposition
in
the
uk
parliament
