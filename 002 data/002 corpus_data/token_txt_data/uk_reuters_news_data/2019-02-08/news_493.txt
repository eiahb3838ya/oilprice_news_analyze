brussels
reuters
the
european
union
s
hawks
have
called
for
more
sanctions
on
russia
after
a
fresh
of
tensions
with
ukraine
but
the
divided
bloc
is
not
going
to
act
swiftly
if
at
all
diplomatic
sources
said
in
a
sign
of
their
divisions
on
how
to
handle
president
vladimir
putin
s
russia
the
eu
states
have
taken
three
days
to
agree
a
joint
statement
after
russia
seized
ukrainian
navy
vessels
and
sailors
on
sunday
in
the
end
the
bloc
issued
a
statement
by
its
top
diplomat
federica
mogherini
on
wednesday
night
expressing
utmost
concern
about
the
dangerous
increase
of
tensions
and
dismay
at
the
unacceptable
use
of
force
by
russia
the
three
former
soviet
republics
sitting
on
the
baltic
sea
coast
backed
by
poland
and
britain
wanted
much
tougher
language
on
more
sanctions
looming
several
senior
european
politicians
raised
the
prospect
on
tuesday
and
president
donald
trump
said
he
might
cancel
a
meeting
with
putin
later
this
week
over
the
maritime
clash
he
described
as
aggression
but
the
bloc
s
top
powers
germany
and
france
have
so
far
emphasised
efforts
to
ease
tensions
the
statement
by
mogherini
did
not
mention
sanctions
but
only
says
regarding
the
situation
that
the
bloc
will
continue
to
follow
closely
and
act
countries
including
italy
greece
bulgaria
and
cyprus
have
long
called
for
a
softer
stance
moscow
saying
the
bloc
s
existing
economic
sanctions
over
russia
s
role
in
the
turmoil
in
ukraine
hurt
eu
businesses
too
we
are
not
going
to
move
very
quickly
on
any
new
sanctions
there
could
be
some
later
on
that
is
not
ruled
out
but
for
now
the
unity
of
the
is
key
and
focus
on
one
eu
diplomat
said
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
spoke
to
putin
and
ukraine
s
president
petro
poroshenko
on
tuesday
russian
foreign
minister
sergei
lavrov
was
in
france
there
is
a
lot
of
contacts
going
on
let
s
see
where
they
take
us
i
doubt
we
will
rush
on
sanctions
too
much
another
eu
diplomat
also
said
the
bloc
first
imposed
sanctions
after
russia
annexed
the
black
sea
peninsula
of
crimea
from
kiev
in
brussels
tightened
the
measures
as
moscow
went
on
to
back
rebels
fighting
against
government
troops
in
east
ukraine
eu
leaders
are
expected
to
decide
to
roll
the
economic
sanctions
over
for
another
year
when
they
meet
in
brussels
in
december
they
could
also
look
at
any
new
punitive
measures
then
after
a
discussion
among
their
foreign
ministers
on
in
order
to
discuss
sanctions
we
d
need
to
have
a
clearer
picture
of
what
happened
another
eu
source
said
highlighting
unease
in
some
eu
quarters
that
poroshenko
could
also
stand
to
gain
from
the
situation
putin
on
wednesday
accused
poroshenko
of
orchestrating
a
provocation
in
the
sea
to
boost
his
flagging
popularity
ratings
before
an
election
next
year
following
the
incident
ukraine
introduced
martial
law
in
parts
of
the
country
it
says
are
vulnerable
to
russian
attack
the
european
commission
has
said
it
received
important
assurances
from
poroshenko
that
this
would
not
interfere
with
democratic
processes
or
restrict
citizens
rights
the
eu
statement
called
on
russia
to
free
the
ukrainian
vessels
and
sailors
as
well
as
ensure
unrestricted
sea
access
it
would
urge
both
sides
to
show
restraint
and
express
support
for
ukraine
s
territorial
integrity
and
sovereignty
diplomatic
sources
said
eu
diplomats
said
the
latest
escalation
weakens
the
hand
of
russia
doves
in
the
bloc
while
the
eu
was
unlikely
to
introduce
new
economic
sanctions
it
could
add
more
names
to
its
existing
blacklists
including
some
russian
military
personnel
the
sources
said
despite
the
fact
that
imposing
any
sanctions
requires
the
unanimity
of
all
eu
states
the
bloc
has
at
times
had
problems
enforcing
them
as
prominently
showcased
when
gas
turbines
made
by
germany
s
siemens
were
delivered
to
crimea
enforcing
and
policing
eu
sanctions
is
a
matter
for
every
state
separately
but
they
sometimes
fail
to
act
lacking
the
political
will
or
bowing
to
pressure
from
their
businesses
the
state
department
called
on
the
eu
on
tuesday
to
do
more
to
help
ukraine
in
its
struggle
with
russia
including
through
tougher
enforcement
of
existing
sanctions
and
dropping
support
for
the
nord
stream
pipeline
with
moscow
washington
which
under
trump
has
promoted
more
exports
of
its
own
natural
gas
that
competes
with
russia
has
long
lobbied
the
eu
against
the
construction
of
another
pipeline
that
would
deepen
the
bloc
s
dependence
on
russian
gas
deliveries
the
government
has
threatened
to
sanction
those
involved
in
the
project
but
germany
the
final
destination
of
the
pipeline
and
the
project
s
with
russia
said
it
was
sticking
to
it
