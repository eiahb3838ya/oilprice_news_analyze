donald
trump
s
stunning
white
house
win
got
a
major
boost
from
sagging
democratic
enthusiasm
in
pennsylvania
but
now
the
party
is
poised
for
big
wins
on
tuesday
in
congressional
races
in
the
state
that
could
signal
which
party
controls
the
house
of
representatives
a
overhaul
of
pennsylvania
voting
districts
and
stubbornly
low
approval
ratings
for
trump
in
the
state
have
placed
democrats
within
striking
distance
of
claiming
at
least
half
of
pennsylvania
s
congressional
seats
in
a
test
of
the
party
s
ability
to
win
back
voters
republicans
are
scrambling
take
republican
incumbent
keith
rothfus
he
won
election
in
in
pennsylvania
s
current
district
outside
pittsburgh
which
includes
some
staunch
republican
strongholds
the
attorney
was
reelected
twice
by
constituents
who
favoured
trump
by
over
percentage
points
in
but
redistricting
has
forced
rothfus
into
a
new
district
where
only
percent
of
voters
are
republicans
and
nearly
half
are
democrats
opinion
polls
now
show
rothfus
trailing
moderate
democrat
conor
lamb
a
former
marine
who
gained
political
stardom
by
winning
a
special
house
election
in
a
solidly
republican
district
last
spring
lamb
has
support
from
more
than
half
of
likely
voters
the
change
in
democratic
fortunes
increases
the
party
s
hopes
of
making
the
net
gain
of
seats
it
needs
to
control
the
house
and
stall
much
of
trump
s
agenda
republicans
are
favoured
to
hold
the
senate
pennsylvania
is
going
to
be
the
bellwether
it
is
ground
zero
if
you
re
looking
at
who
s
going
to
control
the
house
said
mike
devanney
a
republican
strategist
democrats
who
currently
hold
six
of
pennsylvania
s
house
seats
could
win
at
least
nine
according
to
the
university
of
virginia
centre
for
politics
which
tracks
house
and
senate
races
anything
more
than
that
probably
would
reflect
an
outcome
in
which
democrats
won
significantly
more
than
the
net
seats
they
need
said
centre
analyst
kyle
kondik
all
told
at
least
seven
house
republican
seats
once
considered
safe
are
now
in
play
as
a
result
of
the
redrawn
map
in
pennsylvania
we
were
having
elections
that
did
not
have
two
candidates
running
in
them
in
many
of
these
districts
that
doesn
t
give
people
a
real
choice
lamb
told
reuters
in
an
interview
a
citizen
deserves
to
have
a
competitive
rothfus
who
was
not
available
for
an
interview
has
campaigned
largely
on
economic
issues
a
position
that
won
him
an
endorsement
on
friday
from
the
pittsburgh
the
healthy
economy
we
re
seeing
is
a
result
of
a
combination
of
the
tax
cuts
and
jobs
act
and
the
deregulation
of
small
businesses
rothfus
said
last
month
on
twitter
that
s
what
is
putting
americans
to
work
and
that
s
what
is
putting
more
money
in
their
republicans
and
democrats
have
both
tried
to
use
district
lines
to
maximize
their
power
the
last
redistricting
wave
began
eight
years
ago
when
the
conservative
tea
party
movement
driven
by
opposition
to
democratic
former
president
barack
obama
gave
republicans
control
of
the
house
and
new
governorships
the
dynamics
underlying
this
year
s
house
races
in
pennsylvania
including
anger
among
democratic
and
independent
voters
over
trump
could
give
democrats
a
shot
at
exceeding
their
state
sweep
in
which
was
a
banner
year
nationally
for
the
party
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
ordered
the
state
s
new
district
map
earlier
this
year
in
a
ruling
that
later
survived
a
republican
challenge
to
the
supreme
court
under
the
new
map
two
house
seats
outside
philadelphia
where
republican
incumbents
are
stepping
down
are
seen
as
likely
democratic
or
safe
democratic
wins
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of
a
trio
of
political
forecasting
groups
cook
political
report
inside
elections
and
the
university
of
virginia
s
centre
for
politics
a
third
republican
seat
with
a
retiring
incumbent
near
the
eastern
city
of
allentown
is
rated
as
leaning
democratic
meanwhile
trump
s
political
style
looks
to
be
becoming
a
liability
a
franklin
marshall
college
survey
of
likely
pennsylvania
voters
conducted
found
that
percent
preferred
democratic
house
candidates
two
out
of
three
viewed
that
choice
as
a
vote
against
trump
who
has
a
percent
approval
rate
in
the
state
at
least
three
other
house
republican
incumbents
mike
kelly
scott
perry
and
brian
fitzpatrick
are
in
tight
reelection
battles
democrat
george
scott
needs
republican
support
to
defeat
perry
in
a
district
including
the
state
capital
harrisburg
on
thursday
he
was
able
to
showcase
republican
backing
by
appearing
with
about
a
dozen
republicans
including
a
former
state
senator
a
former
state
representative
and
a
staffer
to
a
former
republican
governor
several
said
perry
had
become
too
partisan
in
washington
where
he
joined
the
hardline
conservative
house
freedom
caucus
perry
whose
campaign
declined
an
interview
request
has
defended
membership
in
that
group
it
is
not
a
organization
we
take
anybody
that
comes
perry
said
in
a
debate
last
month
according
to
local
media
the
critics
expressed
concern
over
perry
s
votes
to
repeal
the
affordable
care
act
obama
s
signature
healthcare
program
and
its
insurance
protections
for
people
with
preexisting
medical
conditions
former
state
representative
steve
nickol
told
reuters
that
he
supported
perry
during
his
first
run
for
congress
but
was
dismayed
to
see
him
become
radically
partisan
in
washington
i
ve
talked
to
even
some
elected
republican
officials
who
are
kind
of
upset
with
the
way
things
are
and
feel
that
scott
perry
is
a
little
too
extreme
in
some
of
his
positions
nickol
said
they
re
not
about
to
come
out
and
endorse
george
even
though
they
ve
told
me
in
private
that
they
ll
vote
