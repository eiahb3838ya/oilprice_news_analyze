for kavanaugh, a collegial start to u.s. supreme court career
washington
reuters
brett
kavanaugh
spent
a
collegial
first
day
on
the
bench
as
a
supreme
court
justice
on
tuesday
that
contrasted
sharply
with
the
venom
of
his
confirmation
process
taking
an
active
role
in
arguments
alongside
his
eight
new
colleagues
kavanaugh
a
veteran
of
such
proceedings
after
years
on
an
influential
appeals
court
looked
at
ease
as
he
asked
several
questions
during
two
hours
of
lively
oral
arguments
involving
a
federal
sentencing
law
for
repeat
offenders
it
seemed
like
business
as
usual
in
the
ornate
courtroom
three
days
after
kavanaugh
was
confirmed
by
the
senate
despite
being
accused
of
sexual
assault
by
a
university
professor
named
christine
blasey
ford
appointed
by
president
donald
trump
kavanaugh
s
confirmation
cemented
a
conservative
majority
on
the
court
that
could
last
for
years
kavanaugh
took
his
seat
at
the
right
end
of
the
courtroom
s
mahogany
bench
the
location
assigned
to
the
court
s
member
and
wore
traditional
black
robes
like
the
other
justices
retired
justice
anthony
kennedy
the
jurist
who
kavanaugh
replaced
was
in
the
courtroom
as
were
members
of
the
new
justice
s
family
with
police
standing
by
a
small
group
of
protesters
demonstrated
outside
the
courthouse
holding
signs
saying
shame
and
he
sits
on
a
throne
of
lies
while
chanting
this
isn
t
over
we
re
still
with
courtroom
security
tight
there
were
no
disruptions
by
protesters
during
the
arguments
as
there
had
been
during
kavanaugh
s
confirmation
hearings
chief
justice
john
roberts
formally
welcomed
kavanaugh
to
a
court
that
now
has
five
conservative
members
and
four
liberals
we
wish
you
a
long
and
happy
career
in
our
common
calling
roberts
told
kavanaugh
who
could
serve
for
decades
in
the
lifetime
job
the
bitterly
divided
senate
voted
on
saturday
to
confirm
kavanaugh
with
just
one
democrat
supporting
him
kavanaugh
s
confirmation
gave
the
republican
president
a
political
victory
ahead
of
crucial
congressional
elections
kavanaugh
was
trump
s
second
selection
for
the
nation
s
highest
judicial
body
following
conservative
justice
neil
gorsuch
last
year
kavanaugh
posed
questions
to
lawyers
in
both
cases
before
the
court
his
first
one
coming
about
minutes
into
the
arguments
at
one
point
kavanaugh
could
be
seen
having
a
lighthearted
exchange
with
liberal
justice
elena
kagan
seated
next
to
him
at
another
point
liberal
justice
sonia
sotomayor
appeared
to
pinch
gorsuch
sitting
next
to
her
to
playfully
illustrate
her
point
about
what
constitutes
a
violent
act
gorsuch
responded
with
a
faux
grimace
of
pain
tuesday
s
cases
involved
the
armed
career
criminal
act
a
criminal
sentencing
law
that
boosts
prison
sentences
for
people
who
are
convicted
of
crimes
involving
guns
if
they
previously
have
been
convicted
of
certain
other
crimes
the
cases
involving
a
florida
robbery
and
burglaries
in
tennessee
and
arkansas
challenged
the
types
of
crimes
that
qualify
as
violent
felonies
under
that
law
and
can
lead
to
mandatory
minimum
sentences
roberts
prompted
laughter
when
he
described
asking
his
law
clerks
to
try
to
grab
a
dollar
bill
from
his
hand
to
determine
if
that
constituted
a
violent
act
i
m
not
saying
nobody
could
do
it
but
it
requires
a
lot
of
force
more
than
you
might
think
roberts
said
based
on
tuesday
s
arguments
defendants
could
win
in
both
cases
with
liberal
justices
likely
to
be
joined
by
some
conservatives
in
the
majority
kavanaugh
appeared
less
sympathetic
to
the
defendants
than
gorsuch
kavanaugh
had
served
as
a
judge
on
the
court
of
appeals
in
washington
since
before
tuesday
s
arguments
the
justices
turned
aside
appeals
of
a
ruling
authored
by
kavanaugh
while
on
the
lower
court
striking
down
a
environmental
rule
imposed
under
democratic
former
president
barack
obama
regulating
a
potent
greenhouse
gas
linked
to
climate
change
the
justices
privately
made
the
decision
to
reject
the
appeals
by
an
environmental
group
and
companies
that
supported
the
regulation
before
kavanaugh
s
confirmation
and
announced
the
action
on
tuesday
kavanaugh
is
expected
to
push
the
court
further
to
the
right
as
he
is
replacing
kennedy
a
conservative
who
sometimes
voted
with
the
liberal
justices
on
key
social
issues
such
as
abortion
and
gay
rights
his
nomination
had
appeared
safe
until
ford
last
month
went
public
with
allegations
that
kavanaugh
sexually
assaulted
her
in
when
they
were
high
school
students
in
maryland
two
other
women
accused
kavanaugh
of
sexual
misconduct
dating
to
the
kavanaugh
denied
the
allegations
and
during
a
senate
hearing
accused
democrats
of
an
orchestrated
political
he
later
expressed
regret
over
some
of
his
comments
but
critics
said
kavanaugh
s
demeanor
raised
questions
about
his
temperament
and
potential
political
bias
in
deciding
cases
at
a
white
house
ceremony
on
monday
night
kavanaugh
said
he
was
starting
his
new
job
with
no
bitterness
seeking
to
be
a
force
for
stability
and
trump
on
twitter
on
tuesday
said
he
was
very
proud
of
kavanaugh
and
his
family
and
disparaged
the
protesters
