the
slaying
of
two
competitors
at
a
jacksonville
video
game
tournament
on
sunday
has
stirred
the
gun
rights
debate
in
florida
on
the
eve
of
its
hotly
contested
state
and
federal
primary
elections
with
florida
voters
scheduled
to
pick
candidates
for
governor
and
congress
on
tuesday
some
democratic
contenders
said
the
shooting
was
further
evidence
of
the
need
for
stricter
gun
legislation
while
other
hopefuls
cancelled
campaign
appearances
we
as
society
have
to
come
together
and
say
enough
of
this
democratic
senator
bill
nelson
told
reporters
in
jacksonville
near
the
site
of
the
shooting
at
a
madden
online
football
game
tournament
the
violence
which
also
injured
people
was
the
latest
in
a
series
of
shootings
in
the
state
following
the
killing
of
students
and
educators
at
a
high
school
in
february
and
the
massacre
of
people
at
an
orlando
nightclub
in
the
jacksonville
sheriff

identified
the
shooter
who
took
his
own

could
not
independently
confirm
the
report
nelson
s
campaign
is
facing
a
november
challenge
by
the
state
s
republican
governor
rick
scott
in
one
of
the
key
races
that
will
determine
the
balance
of
power
in
the
senate
gun
rights
which
are
covered
by
the
second
amendment
of
the
constitution
are
one
of
the
most
contentious
themes
of
american
politics
the
debate
breaks
along
party
lines
with
republicans
typically
arguing
that
better
enforcement
of
existing
gun
laws
is
the
best
way
to
deter
shootings
while
democrats
call
for
more
restrictions
on
weapons
ownership
given
the
partisan
breakdown
the
shooting
may
not
change
outcomes
in
tuesday
s
primaries
where
people
will
pick
candidates
from
within
their
own
parties

their
democratic

on
putnam
and
his
leading
republican
rival
representative
ron
desantis
to
offer
a
stronger
policy

are
avoiding
jacksonville

are
scared
to
answer
questions
on
gun
violence
