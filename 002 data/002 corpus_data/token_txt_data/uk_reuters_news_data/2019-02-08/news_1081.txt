and
the
use

wednesday
after
the

accused
them
of
being
unsavory
radicals
protests
by
militants
in
the
eastern
city
of
chemnitz
two
weeks
ago
after
the
fatal
stabbing
of
a
german
blamed
on
two
migrants
have
reignited
a
fierce
debate
about
merkel
s
decision
to
let
in
more
than
a
million
refugees
there
is
no
excuse
or
reason
for
hunting
people
down
using
violence
and
nazi
slogans
showing
hostility
to
people
who
look
different
who
have
a
jewish
restaurant
for
attacks
on
police
officers
merkel
told
the
bundestag
we
will
not
allow
whole
groups
in
our
society
to
be
quietly
excluded
she
said
adding
that
jews
muslims
christians
and
atheists
all
belong
in

bundestag
said
germany
s
domestic
peace
was
at
risk
as
disgusting
as
hitler
salutes
are
i
would
like
to
remind
you
that
the
really
serious
event
in
chemnitz
was
the
bloody
deed
committed
by
two
asylum
seekers
said
alexander
gauland
he
accused
merkel
of
spreading
fake
news
about
the
protests
and
supported
maassen
head
of
the
bfv
intelligence
agency
who
is
under
fire
for
questioning
whether
video
footage
showing
rightist
gangs
hounding
migrants
were
real
the
truth
is
there
was
no
hunting
down
of
people
in
chemnitz
the
citizens
who
demonstrated
were
criminalised
said
gauland
mrs
chancellor
you
have
nothing
more
to
offer
the
people
of
this
country
than
obstinacy
dogmatism
and
insults
barricade
yourself
up
in
the
chancellery
away
from
reality
after
maassen
took
questions
from
a
parliamentary
committee
behind
closed
doors
about
his
comments
on
event
in
chemnitz
interior
minister
horst
seehofer
said
he
saw
no
reason
to
dismiss
the
bfv
chief
but
the
spd
said
that
after
examining
a
bfv
report
on
the
violence
and
hearing
maassen
s
defence
of
his
disputed
views
that
he
should
resign
saying
it
remained
unconvinced
he
was
the
right
person
to
lead
the
agency
the
spd

the
junior
member
of
merkel
s
coalition
the
afd
some
of
whose
members
joined

the
third
biggest
party
in
germany
its
lawmakers
presence
in
parliament
which
they
entered
after
the
election
has
generated
a
more
confrontational
climate
senior
social
democrat
johannes
kahrs
launched
a
verbal
attack
on
the
afd

you
ugly
look
in
the
mirror
at
that
all

stood
up
and
left
the
