the
european
union
is
looking
at
how
brexit
might
be
postponed
and
is
open
to
the
idea
with
eu
officials
talking
of
delays
from
a
few
weeks
to
a
full
year
but
it
questions
whether
any
such
move
can
prevent
a
divided
nation
crashing
out
in
chaos
senior
representatives
of
member
states
and
eu
institutions
in
brussels
who
are
close
to
negotiations
told
reuters
that
an
extension
to
the
march
deadline
for
britain
to
leave
the
bloc
was
becoming
more
likely
as
prime
minister
theresa
may
struggles
to
win
parliamentary
backing
for
a
treaty
she
agreed
last
month
it
s
probably
the
most
likely
outcome
now
said
one
senior
official
who
said
eu
leaders
now
expected
may
to
either
lose
a
vote
on
the
withdrawal
agreement
due
next
tuesday
or
to
postpone
a
reckoning
with
lawmakers
as
she
did
a
month
ago
we
can
of
course
postpone
brexit
no
one
wants
a
deal
said
a
second
but
the
question
would
remain
what
is
it
for
to
hold
a
general
election
another
referendum
it
is
not
clear
that
britain
can
resolve
its
problems
this
person
said
so
eu
leaders
would
question
the
point
of
a
delay
the
senior
figure
said
a
brexit
would
hurt
the
eu
less
than
britain
and
added
in
an
echo
of
may
s
defiant
mantra
early
in
the
talks
no
deal
is
better
than
a
bad
defeat
for
may
would
leave
the
process
in
uncharted
territory
talks
between
britain
and
the
eu
on
how
to
handle
that
have
been
very
limited
with
only
close
aides
to
leaders
involved
eu
officials
say
eu
experts
have
prepared
various
scenarios
and
british
officials
have
sought
indications
of
how
delaying
brexit
might
work
one
official
said
may
s
government
insisted
on
tuesday
that
it
has
no
plans
to
delay
the
march
departure
following
a
newspaper
report
that
british
officials
had
sounded
out
the
eu
about
a
postponement
among
brexit
scenarios
now
being
considered
in
brussels
are
britain
asking
to
delay
departure
under
article
of
the
eu
treaty
this
would
require
unanimous
approval
by
the
other
states
something
eu
officials
say
would
be
likely
to
be
granted
britain
revoking
its
notice
of
withdrawal
while
avoiding
a
huge
backlash
from
brexit
supporters
by
indicating
it
would
revive
its
notification
shortly
under
an
eu
court
ruling
last
month
this
would
not
need
eu
approval
and
so
may
prove
simpler
britain
revoking
its
notice
of
withdrawal
pending
a
new
election
or
referendum
to
decide
how
or
whether
to
leave
a
short
delay
of
at
most
three
months
so
as
to
avoid
a
problem
for
the
european
parliament
the
legislature
is
due
to
meet
in
july
for
a
first
sitting
after
eu
elections
in
late
may
a
longer
delay
of
up
to
a
year
which
would
complicate
the
legal
status
of
the
new
european
parliament
this
might
mean
britain
having
to
elect
new
eu
lawmakers
in
may
even
if
it
still
planned
to
leave
the
union
within
the
coming
year
may
has
been
seeking
fresh
commitments
from
brussels
to
appease
opponents
some
of
whom
prefer
leaving
with
no
deal
and
others
who
would
rather
not
leave
the
eu
at
all
but
eu
leaders
have
lined
up
to
rule
out
any
change
to
the
draft
and
officials
say
that
any
public
reassurances
that
the
eu
might
give
would
be
limited
to
reiterations
of
the
terms
