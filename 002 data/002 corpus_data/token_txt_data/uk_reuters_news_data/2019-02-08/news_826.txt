brussels
reuters
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
offered
her
fellow
eu
leaders
no
new
brexit
proposals
on
wednesday
though
she
appeared
keen
to
reach
an
agreement
the
head
of
the
european
parliament
said
antonio
tajani
spoke
after
listening
to
her
address
in
brussels
where
she
is
meeting
the
other
eu
leaders
on
the
talks
stalled
over
how
to
ensure
a
continued
open
irish
border
after
britain
leaves
tajani
said
may
said
she
would
evaluate
an
idea
to
extend
the
transition
period
by
a
year
from
the
current
date
at
the
end
of
but
that
the
british
prime
minister
did
not
say
whether
she
would
favour
that
or
not
there
is
a
message
of
goodwill
readiness
to
reach
an
agreement
but
i
did
not
perceive
anything
substantially
new
in
terms
of
content
as
i
listened
to
may
tajani
said
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
the
content
is
not
yet
acceptable
but
the
tone
is
of
somebody
who
wishes
to
continue
the
negotiations
and
not
let
them
break
down
he
said
on
may
s
comments
made
to
eu
leaders
behind
closed
doors
tajani
said
the
european
parliament
which
must
endorse
any
brexit
deal
sealed
between
london
and
the
eu
for
it
to
take
effect
was
in
favour
of
extending
the
transition
period
to
three
years
from
months
both
sides
mentioned
the
idea
of
an
extension
of
the
transition
period
as
one
possibility
which
is
on
the
table
and
would
have
to
be
looked
into
he
added
mrs
may
recalled
the
importance
of
a
customs
territory
but
we
are
defending
the
single
may
s
office
had
ruled
out
extending
the
period
even
though
some
members
of
the
government
had
held
out
that
possibility
