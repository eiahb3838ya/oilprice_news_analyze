struck
a
more
conciliatory
tone
over
california
s
raging
wildfires
on

was
in
constant
contact
with
officials
there
a
day
after

exacerbating
the
fires
one
of
the
major
fires
in
california
dubbed
the
mendocino
complex
became
the
biggest
in
state
history
on
tuesday
eclipsing
a
previous
record
set
only
eight
months
ago
as
hot
windy
conditions
fanned
the
blazes
in
what
governor
jerry
brown
has
called
a
new
the
mendocino
complex
made
up
of
two
fires
grew
to
nearly
acres
hectares
almost
the

cal
fire

and
ventura
counties
in
southern
california
last
december
destroying
over
structures
in
the
last
two
days
trump
has
said
california
was
letting
water
run
into
the
ocean
instead
of
using
it
to
fight
blazes
and
blamed
california
s
environmental
policies
for
worsening
the
fires
the
comments
baffled
california
firefighters
who
said
they
had
more
than
enough
water
to
douse
the
flames
we
re
going
to
have
to
have
some
meetings
about
it
because
there
are
things
you
can
do
to
mitigate
what
s
happening

jersey
the
fires
have
killed
seven
people
destroyed
over
structures
and
displaced
tens
of
thousands
of
people
over
the
past
month
climate
change
is
widely
blamed
for
higher
temperatures
that
have
fueled
wildfires
in
california
and
as
far
afield
as
portugal
sweden
and
siberia
temperatures
in
northern
california
could
reach
degrees
fahrenheit
celsius
over
the
next
few
days
the
national
weather
service
said
making
it
easier
for
fire
to
spread
the
mendocino
complex
has
burnt
homes
and
forced
the
evacuation
of
people
firefighters
are
trying
to
keep
fire
out
of
communities
like
nice
lucerne
and
clearlake
oaks
it
s
going
into
residences
backyards
farmland

mitch
bosma
a
spokesman
with
cal
fire
the
fires
are
on
track
to
be
the
most
destructive
in
a
decade
prompting
brown
and
republican
leaders
such
as
state
senator
ted
gaines
to
call
for
thinning
and
controlled
burns
of
forests
to
reduce
fire
danger
moves
opposed
by
environmentalists
who
say
they
kill
wildlife
we
have
to
the
way
we
manage
our
forests
the
way
we
build
our
houses
how
we
build
them
where
we
build
them
and
how
much
we
invest
in
our
fire
protection
services
