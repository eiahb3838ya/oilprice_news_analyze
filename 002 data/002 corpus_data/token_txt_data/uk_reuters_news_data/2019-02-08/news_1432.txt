from
both
parties
denounced
trump
s
behaviour
particularly
at
his

tough
questioning
from
democrats
and
republicans
during
testimony
before
the
senator
foreign
relations
committee
about
trump
s
failure
to
hold
the
russian
president
accountable
for
moscow
s
meddling
in
the
election
at
their
meeting
in
helsinki
last
week
i
have
tremendous
faith
in
you
i
think
you
re
a
patriot
but
it
s
the
president
s
actions
that
create
tremendous
distrust
in
our
nation
the
committee
s
republican
chairman
bob
corker
told
pompeo
is
there
some
strategy
behind
creating
doubt
in
senators
minds
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
doubt
in
the
american
people
as
to
what
his
motivations
are
added
corker
a
frequent
critic
of
trump
corker
also
criticized
comments
by
trump
that
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
was
very
talented
and
that
he
loves
his
people
given
the
country
s
serious
human
rights
abuses
really
corker
said
pompeo
said
he
had
been
comprehensively
briefed
on
trump
s
meeting
with
putin
who
intelligence
agencies
said
knew
about
russia
s
meddling
in
the
election
putin
has
said
no
such
interference
occurred
and
trump
has
denied
there
was
any
collusion
between
his
campaign
and
moscow
the
matter
is
under
investigation
by
special
counsel
robert
mueller
in
often
testy
exchanges
with
senators
pompeo
listed
actions
by
the
trump
administration
against
russia
including
what
he
said
were
over
sanctions
against
moscow
just
before
his
testimony
pompeo
issued
a
statement
restating
policy
rejecting
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
the
crimea
declaration
appeared
to
try
to
quell
suggestions
that
washington
could
accept
moscow
s
occupation
of
the
ukrainian
peninsula
following
the
meeting
and
questions
about
what
trump
agreed
to
in
the
talks
trump
has
repeatedly
declined
to
hold
putin
accountable
for
annexing
crimea
pointing
to
former
president
barack
obama
instead
for
allowing
it
to
happen
under
his
watch
the
united
states
rejects
russia
s
attempted
annexation
of
crimea
and
pledges
to
maintain
this
policy
until
ukraine
s
territorial
integrity
is
restored
pompeo
said
in
the
statement
the
united
states
calls
on
russia
to
respect
the
principles
to
which
it
has
long
claimed
to
adhere
and
to
end
its
occupation
of
crimea
he
said
pompeo
later
reassured
senators
that
the
united
states
would
not
lift
sanctions
against
russia
until
moscow
returned
control
of
crimea
to
ukraine
russia
s
foreign
ministry
quickly
dismissed
pompeo
s
comments
we
know
the
worth
of
such
momentous
declarations
ministry
spokeswoman
maria
zakharova
said
on
her
facebook
account
speaking
after
the
summit
putin
said
trump
believed
that
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
was
legal
based
on
a
referendum
white
house
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
said
on
wednesday
that
trump
would
postpone
a
second
meeting
with
putin
until
next
year
after
the
federal
probe
into
the
alleged
meddling
is
over
trump
said
last
week
he
would
invite
putin
to
washington
for
an
autumn
meeting
a
move
that
sparked
a
new
outcry
including
from
lawmakers
in
trump
s
republican
party
who
argued
that
putin
was
an
adversary
not
worthy
of
a
white
house
visit
pompeo
declined
to
offer
details
of
what
he
knew
about
the
helsinki
meeting
he
said
conversations
between
the
president
and
his
cabinet
should
remain
private
you
come
before
a
group
of
senators
today
who
are
filled
with
serious
doubts
about
this
white
house
and
its
conduct
of
american
foreign
policy
corker
said
democrats
like
senator
chris
coons
voiced
concern
about
how
trump
s
courting
of
putin
unsettled
allies
while
your
statements
have
been
clear
our
president
s
statements
have
confused
our
allies
encouraged
our
adversaries
and
have
failed
to
be
comparably
clear
and
i
m
concerned
that
an
invitation
to
president
putin
to
the
white
house
without
clarity
about
his
threats
to
our
election
his
threats
to
our
allies
puts
at
risk
clarity
