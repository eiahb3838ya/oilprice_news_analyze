lee
best
director

i
found
out
about
these
golden
globe
nominations
for
blackkklansman
in
between
advising
my
nyu
grad
school
students
because
i
teach
on
thursdays
the
first

was

for

book
i
m
humbled
that
all
our
work
has
been
recognised
in

for

to
embody
a
man
with
breadth

so
grateful

has
resonance
in
a
time
that
calls
for
alfonso
cuaron
best
director
nominee
for
roma
at
its
core
this
film
is
about
celebrating
families
and
people
and
encourages
in
my
belief
that
the
human
experience
is
one
and
the
same
for
adam
mckay
best
director
nominee
for
vice
what
we
tried
to
do
was
reflect
the
times
that
we
are
living
in
which
can
be
pretty
absurd
and
pretty
dramatic
and
tragic
at
the
same
time
it
s
an
amazing
portrayal
of
power
with
what
s
going
on
in
the
world
that
kind
of
subject
and
those
kinds
of
performances
resonate
with
the
john
david
washington
best
actor
nominee
for
blackkklansman
my
deepest
appreciation
to
the
legendary
spike
lee
we
stand
on
