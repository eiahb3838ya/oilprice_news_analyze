beijing

china
s
exports
are
expected
to
have
maintained
solid
growth
in
july
despite
new
tariffs
on
billions
of
dollars
of
shipments
to
the
united
states
though
the
outlook
has
darkened
as
both
sides
raised
the
stakes
in
a
trade
conflict
that
has
rattled
financial
markets
china
proposed
retaliatory
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
goods
ranging
from
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
to
some
aircraft
on
friday
following
a
proposal
by
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
for
a
higher
percent
tariff
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
the
increasingly
heated
rhetoric
between
beijing
and
washington
has
rattled
global
markets
worried
about
the
impact
on
world
trade
and
growth
with
few
signs
either
side
is
willing
to
make
significant
concessions
economists
say
that
tariffs
on
billion
billion
pounds
of
china
s
exports
to
the
united
states
which
went
into
effect
on
july
so
far
are
not
having
a
significant
impact
on
overall
chinese
exports
july
exports
are
predicted
to
have
risen
percent
according
to
median
estimates
from
economists
compared
to
percent
growth
in
june
while
july
s
forecast
does
not
point
to
any
sharp
slowdown
economists
do
see
headwinds
mounting
for
china
s
massive
export
sector
in
addition
to
the
tariffs
impact
there
might
be
some
impact
from
of
orders
in
previous
months
said
betty
wang
senior
china
economist
at
anz
in
hong
kong
there
will
be
some
gradual
impacts
that
could
be
seen
over
the
following
months
as
this
is
the
first
month
the
tariffs
were
anz
forecasts
china
s
exports
rose
percent
in
july
markets
will
be
closely
watching
the
data
on
trade
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
as
well
as
china
s
trade
surplus
with
the
united
states
a
sore
point
in
the
trade
relationship
the
billion
of
chinese
exports
impacted
by
current
tariffs
amount
to
less
than
percent
of
its
total
exports
to
the
united
states
last
year
trump
however
has
effectively
threatened
to
slap
tariffs
on
all
of
china
s
shipments
to
the
united
states
the
asian
giant
s
largest
export
market
china
s
surplus
with
the
swelled
to
a
record
in
june
as
exports
continued
to
rise
though
signs
of
orders
suggest
the
spike
may
have
been
a
china
s
imports
are
expected
to
have
risen
percent
in
july
picking
up
from
percent
growth
in
june
the
poll
showed
china
s
overall
trade
surplus
likely
fell
to
billion
in
july
from
billion
in
june
though
that
amount
would
be
china
s
surplus
of
the
year
there
was
no
separate
forecast
on
china
s
trade
surplus
with
the
united
states
which
has
continued
to
grow
even
as
its
total
surplus
has
narrowed
over
the
last
two
years
china
ran
a
billion
goods
trade
surplus
with
the
united
states
in
which
trump
has
said
is
unacceptable
chinese
officials
have
vowed
to
retaliate
against
any
further
measures
though
they
have
also
taken
steps
in
recent
weeks
to
shore
up
economic
growth
and
have
warned
of
the
risks
of
job
losses
as
a
result
of
the
trade
war
these
measures
could
help
mitigate
a
broader
impact
to
economic
growth
economists
say
china
has
made
it
very
clear
it
is
going
to
boost
infrastructure
investment
for
the
second
half
of
the
year
said
anz
s
wang
that
would
support
overall
gdp
growth
momentum
even
though
we
see
more
downside
risk
and
uncertainties
around
the
export
