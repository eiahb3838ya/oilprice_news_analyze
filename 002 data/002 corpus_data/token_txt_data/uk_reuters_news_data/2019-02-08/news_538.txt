to
stop
making
provocations
showing
little
sign
of
backing
down
days
ahead
a

is
due

talks
with
president
donald
trump
during
a
summit
in

at

with
the
rest

the

hoping
they
can
find
a
way
to
a
trade
war
that
is
threatening
the
global
economy
china
s
commerce
ministry
said
it
is
deeply
concerned
by

had
failed
to
alter
its
unfair

it
totally
unacceptable
commerce

spokesman
gao
feng
told
reporters
at
a
news
conference
in
beijing
the
findings
were
issued
in
an
update
of
the
trade
representative
s
section
investigation
which
looks
into
china
s
intellectual
property
and
technology
transfer
policies
and
has
sparked
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
that
later
ballooned
to
billion
gao
said
the
report
reflects
unilateralism
in
violation
of
world
trade
organization
rules
we
hope
the
united
states
will
drop
the
words
and
behaviors
that
damage
bilateral
economic
and
trade
relations
and
adopt
a
constructive
attitude

also
evaluating
the
potential
impact
from
a
separate
proposal
this

increase
control
over
technology
exports
and
said
it
would
take
the
necessary
steps

legitimate
interests

on
monday
proposed
stepping
up
scrutiny
over
technology
exports
in
key
areas
including
artificial
intelligence
and
microprocessor
technology
a
move
that
many
analysts
view
as
directly
targeting
china
a
public
consultation
period
on
the
proposal
to
include
those
sectors
in
its
broader
export
control
regime
is
underway
and

end
on
according

a
document
published

the
government
s
federal
register
on
monday
we
are
evaluating
the
measures
that
the
united
states
may
take
gao
said
stressing
that
washington
s
generalization
of
the
concept
on
national
security
would
only
result
in
unnecessary
barriers
and
damage
trade
china
will
pay
close
attention
to
the
relevant
legislation
and
take
necessary
measures
to
safeguard
the
legitimate
rights
and
interests
of
chinese
enterprises
as
appropriate

demanding
beijing
to
improve
market
access
and
intellectual
property
protections
for
companies
cut
industrial
subsidies
and
slash
a
billion
trade
gap
