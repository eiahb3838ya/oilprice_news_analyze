monza
italy
reuters
french
driver
romain
grosjean
was
disqualified
from
the
italian
grand
prix
on
sunday
after
stewards
upheld
a
renault
protest
against
the
legality
of
his
haas
car
grosjean
had
finished
sixth
in
the
race
sending
haas
ahead
of
renault
in
the
constructors
standings
the
disqualification
which
is
subject
to
appeal
meant
the
french
carmaker
stayed
fourth
while
force
india
s
esteban
ocon
was
promoted
to
sixth
in
the
race
force
india
s
sergio
perez
moved
up
to
seventh
with
renault
s
carlos
sainz
eighth
and
the
williams
pairing
of
lance
stroll
and
sergey
sirotkin
ninth
and
the
point
was
sirotkin
s
first
in
formula
one
the
governing
fia
said
in
a
long
explanation
of
the
ruling
that
renault
had
argued
that
grosjean
s
haas
did
not
comply
with
a
technical
clarification
issued
to
teams
in
july
all
teams
had
been
given
until
monza
to
comply
but
haas
had
not
done
so
with
renault
presenting
photographic
evidence
to
back
their
case
haas
had
provided
details
of
a
new
solution
in
an
email
exchange
with
the
fia
but
had
asked
for
more
time
to
implement
it
given
the
august
break
we
will
endeavour
to
introduce
this
upgrade
for
the
singapore
gp
but
will
be
somewhat
at
the
mercy
of
our
suppliers
so
we
would
request
some
flexibility
in
this
matter
they
had
written
in
an
email
haas
had
thought
their
solution
and
timing
request
had
been
accepted
but
the
fia
said
its
head
of
single
seater
technical
matters
had
warned
them
they
risked
a
protest
if
the
car
was
not
corrected
by
monza
while
the
stewards
are
also
sympathetic
to
the
difficulties
of
producing
these
parts
the
stewards
noted
that
at
least
one
other
competitor
was
able
to
comply
in
the
time
provided
the
statement
said
further
it
was
made
clear
to
the
competitor
from
the
outset
that
the
fia
technical
department
did
not
consider
their
car
to
be
in
compliance
and
further
that
they
left
themselves
open
to
the
circumstances
they
now
the
stewards
ordered
grosjean
to
be
disqualified
from
the
results
and
the
classification
amended
