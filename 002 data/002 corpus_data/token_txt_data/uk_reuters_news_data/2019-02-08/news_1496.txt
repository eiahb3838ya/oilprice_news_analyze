uk pay growth slows to six-month low despite record employment
london
reuters
british
workers
wages
have
risen
at
the
slowest
rate
in
six
months
despite
a
record
number
of
people
in
jobs
challenging
the
bank
of
england
as
it
considers
raising
interest
rates
next
month
for
only
the
second
time
since
the
financial
crisis
average
weekly
earnings
increased
by
an
annual
percent
in
the
three
months
to
may
slowing
from
percent
in
the
three
months
to
april
and
the
weakest
growth
since
november
the
office
for
national
statistics
said
on
tuesday
pay
growth
excluding
bonuses
which
the
boe
says
sometimes
gives
a
better
picture
of
the
underlying
trend
slowed
by
a
similar
amount
to
percent
both
readings
were
in
line
with
the
average
forecast
in
a
reuters
poll
of
economists
markets
took
the
data
in
their
stride
with
the
numbers
doing
little
to
shift
perceptions
that
the
majority
of
the
boe
s
policymakers
will
vote
to
raise
rates
after
their
next
meeting
on
we
see
recent
labour
dynamics
including
today
s
report
as
consistent
with
the
bank
of
england
pressing
ahead
with
an
august
rate
hike
said
investec
economist
victoria
clarke
britain
s
economy
appears
to
be
picking
up
after
a
slow
first
three
months
of
the
year
when
unusually
heavy
snow
hurt
demand
and
the
central
bank
worries
that
growth
is
close
to
the
modest
pace
at
which
it
will
start
to
push
up
inflation
tuesday
s
data
showed
the
unemployment
rate
remained
at
its
since
at
percent
while
the
proportion
of
people
in
employment
rose
to
a
record
percent
after
jobs
were
created
over
the
three
months
to
may
but
economic
growth
since
s
brexit
vote
has
been
weak
by
historic
standards
due
to
high
inflation
and
business
uncertainty
and
on
monday
the
international
monetary
fund
cut
britain
s
growth
forecast
for
to
percent
moreover
the
boe
has
been
repeatedly
surprised
over
the
years
as
the
labour
market
has
tightened
but
wages
have
risen
less
than
expected
a
pattern
seen
to
a
slightly
lesser
degree
in
most
other
advanced
economies
in
recent
years
pay
growth
is
one
of
the
pieces
of
data
the
bank
of
england
looks
at
most
closely
for
signs
that
domestic
inflation
pressures
are
rising
strongly
enough
for
inflation
to
be
at
risk
of
breaching
its
percent
target
over
the
medium
term
if
the
boe
does
not
raise
rates
in
the
immediate
future
boe
governor
mark
carney
said
at
the
start
of
the
month
that
both
the
economy
as
a
whole
and
pay
were
growing
as
the
central
bank
had
forecast
in
may
smoothing
the
way
for
an
august
rate
rise
but
last
week
one
of
his
deputies
jon
cunliffe
who
opposed
november
s
rate
rise
said
pay
growth
did
not
seem
to
be
breaking
out
of
its
recent
percent
range
and
heading
towards
the
percent
growth
rate
that
the
boe
predicts
for
the
end
of
the
year
britain
had
seen
numerous
false
dawns
for
pay
growth
in
the
past
and
there
could
be
more
spare
capacity
in
the
labour
market
than
the
central
bank
thought
he
added
tuesday
s
figures
showed
average
hours
worked
per
employee
had
fallen
giving
scope
for
a
future
increase
in
output
investec
s
clarke
said
slower
wage
growth
probably
reflected
unusually
big
increases
a
year
earlier
the
boe
said
last
month
that
wage
growth
could
slow
for
a
few
months
before
picking
up
in
july
more
than
a
million
health
workers
will
receive
a
pay
rise
of
around
percent
but
other
economists
are
less
sure
pay
will
accelerate
on
a
lasting
basis
low
unemployment
is
yet
to
generate
serious
wage
pressures
and
brexit
uncertainties
continue
to
reign
said
ian
stewart
chief
economist
at
accountants
deloitte
the
case
for
raising
interest
rates
in
august
may
have
strengthened
but
is
hardly
