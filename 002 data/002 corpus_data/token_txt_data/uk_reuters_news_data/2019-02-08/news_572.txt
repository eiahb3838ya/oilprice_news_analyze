winless
in
their
last
tests
away
from
home
their
last
series
victory
in
asia
was
in
india
six
years
ago
and
not
many
would

a
match
to
spare
against
sri

who
defeated
south
africa
at
home
in
july
we
said
we
are
going
to
come
out
here
and
play
bold
cricket

were
quite
courageous
at
times
and
everyone
s
really
bought
into
that
we
are
seeing
the
rewards
now
root
said
at
the

we
have
to
keep
looking
to
improve
we
have
seen
this
team
grow
in
the
last
months
we
are
not
the
finished
article
we
want
to
get
to
number
one
at
some
point
we
have
to
be
consistent
to
do
that
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
on
different
for
the
first
time
in
a
test

wickets
with
leach
and
moeen
sharing
between
them
on
a
turning
track
at
pallekele
sri
lanka
s
captain
lakmal
was
the
only
quick
to
pick
up
a
wicket
while
the
other
was
a
run
out
it
was
also
the
first
time
since
in
karachi
that
no
seamer
took
a
wicket
in
a
test
for
england
when
play
resumed
on
sunday
sri
lanka
s
hopes
of
squaring
the
series
rested
entirely
on
wicketkeeper
niroshan
dickwella
who
was
unbeaten
on
overnight
the
hosts
managed
to
keep
the
england
spinners
at
bay
for
minutes
while
picking
up
singles
to
advance
towards
their
target
but
moeen
broke
their
resistance
by
dismissing
dickwella
who
was
caught
at
slip
by
stokes
for
the
then
sent

lakmal
for
a
duck
two
deliveries
later
before

was
a
brilliant
test
match

of
the
match
for
his
brilliant
in
the
second
innings
we
were
very
good
for
the
whole
game
at
times
we
were
under
pressure
and
we
responded
really
well
to
that
i
couldn
t
be
more
proud
of
the
sri
lanka
batted
well
in
both
innings
but
sam
curran
s
in
the
first
innings
and
root
s
century
under
pressure
in
the
second
made
the
difference
for
england

brilliantly
in
both
innings
added
root
after
registering
his
first
away
series
victory
as
captain
at
times

wickets
but
we

find
ways

get
back
in
the
game

get
the
control
back
in
our
the
