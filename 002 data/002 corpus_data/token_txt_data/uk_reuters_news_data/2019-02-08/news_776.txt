trump adviser tells putin: we'll quit arms control treaty you're breaking
moscow
reuters
washington
will
press
ahead
with
a
plan
to
quit
a
landmark
nuclear
arms
control
pact
despite
objections
from
russia
and
some
european
countries
senior
official
john
bolton
said
on
tuesday
after
meeting
russian
president
vladimir
putin
bolton
had
a
meeting
in
the
kremlin
with
putin
which
resulted
in
an
agreement
for
the
russian
leader
to
hold
talks
with
president
donald
trump
in
paris
next
month
their
first
meeting
since
a
july
summit
in
helsinki
but
the
moscow
talks
appeared
to
yield
no
breakthrough
over
trump
s
stated
desire
for
washington
to
leave
the
nuclear
forces
inf
a
step
moscow
has
decried
as
dangerous
and
many
european
countries
have
warned
could
reignite
a
cold
arms
race
there
s
a
new
strategic
reality
out
there
bolton
who
is
national
security
advisor
to
trump
told
a
news
conference
adding
that
the
cold
treaty
did
not
address
new
missile
threats
from
countries
such
as
china
iran
and
north
korea
and
was
therefore
redundant
in
terms
of
filing
the
formal
notice
of
withdrawal
that
has
not
been
filed
but
it
will
be
filed
in
due
course
he
said
suggesting
it
was
a
process
that
could
take
several
months
moscow
has
warned
washington
it
will
be
forced
to
respond
in
kind
to
restore
the
military
balance
if
trump
carries
through
with
his
threat
to
quit
the
inf
treaty
a
agreement
that
eliminated
all
and
nuclear
and
conventional
missiles
held
by
both
countries
in
europe
putin
used
the
start
of
the
meeting
with
bolton
to
take
the
white
house
to
task
over
what
he
said
were
a
series
of
unprovoked
steps
against
moscow
but
bolton
told
reporters
afterwards
russian
missiles
were
a
threat
and
signalled
washington
would
ignore
russian
objections
to
its
exit
plans
the
problem
is
there
are
russian
inf
violations
in
europe
now
bolton
told
reporters
repeating
an
allegation
moscow
denies
the
threat
is
not
america
s
inf
withdrawal
from
the
treaty
the
threat
is
russian
missiles
already
he
said
russia
had
first
illegally
tested
a
cruise
missile
in
and
described
its
violations
of
the
treaty
as
long
and
deep
russia
in
turn
accuses
washington
of
violating
the
same
treaty
something
it
denies
bolton
has
said
the
treaty
is
outdated
because
other
countries
remain
free
to
make
ballistic
missiles
and
cruise
missiles
while
the
united
states
finds
its
hands
tied
he
noted
that
previous
efforts
to
expand
the
treaty
to
include
other
countries
had
come
to
nothing
putin
made
an
acerbic
reference
to
the
coat
of
arms
at
the
start
of
his
meeting
with
bolton
we
barely
respond
to
any
of
your
steps
but
they
keep
on
coming
he
jokily
complained
to
bolton
on
the
coat
of
the
arms
of
the
united
states
there
s
an
eagle
holding
arrows
in
one
talon
and
an
olive
branch
in
the
other
my
question
is
whether
your
eagle
has
gobbled
up
all
the
olives
leaving
only
the
arrows
bolton
quipped
that
he
had
not
brought
any
olives
before
the
talks
a
kremlin
spokesman
said
the
inf
treaty
had
its
weak
points
but
that
the
approach
of
talking
about
leaving
it
without
proposing
a
replacement
was
dangerous
but
kremlin
foreign
policy
aide
yuri
ushakov
speaking
to
reporters
after
the
talks
finished
sounded
a
conciliatory
note
saying
that
moscow
viewed
bolton
s
visit
as
a
sign
that
washington
wanted
to
continue
dialogue
on
the
issue
he
said
moscow
wanted
the
same
thing
leader
mikhail
gorbachev
now
and
an
original
signatory
to
the
treaty
has
warned
that
unravelling
the
pact
could
have
catastrophic
consequences
countries
such
as
poland
have
however
backed
trump
s
move
trump
s
withdrawal
announcement
is
causing
particular
concern
in
europe
which
was
the
main
beneficiary
of
the
inf
treaty
as
a
result
of
the
removal
of
pershing
and
cruise
missiles
from
europe
and
of
soviet
missiles
from
the
european
part
of
the
then
soviet
union
without
the
treaty
some
european
countries
fear
that
washington
might
deploy
nuclear
missiles
in
europe
again
and
that
russia
might
move
to
deploy
such
missiles
in
its
exclave
of
kaliningrad
which
would
once
again
turn
europe
into
a
potential
nuclear
battlefield
bolton
said
washington
was
a
long
way
from
making
any
such
deployments
in
europe
and
said
grim
warnings
about
the
dangerous
consequences
of
washington
quitting
the
treaty
were
wide
of
the
mark
and
reminded
him
of
similarly
hollow
warnings
when
the
united
states
left
the
cold
missile
treaty
in
it
was
not
true
then
and
it
will
not
be
true
now
