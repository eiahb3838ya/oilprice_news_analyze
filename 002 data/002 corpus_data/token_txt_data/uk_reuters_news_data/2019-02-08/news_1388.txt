trump urges attorney general to end russia probe 'right now'
washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
appealed
to
attorney
general
jeff
sessions
to
end
an
investigation
into
russia
s
role
in
the
election
drawing
a
rebuke
from
his
fellow
republicans
in
congress
who
said
the
probe
must
go
on
it
was
trump
s
most
direct
call
for
his
top
law
enforcement
officer
to
shut
down
special
counsel
robert
mueller
s
criminal
investigation
and
democrats
promptly
accused
the
president
of
trying
to
obstruct
justice
trump
s
remark
coincided
with
the
start
of
the
trial
this
week
of
his
former
campaign
chairman
paul
manafort
on
charges
arising
from
mueller
s
inquiry
in
a
series
of
tweets
trump
called
a
total
hoax
the
idea
his
campaign
worked
with
moscow
which
mueller
is
examining
this
is
a
terrible
situation
and
attorney
general
jeff
sessions
should
stop
this
rigged
witch
hunt
right
now
before
it
continues
to
stain
our
country
any
further
he
said
since
his
surprise
election
in
november
republican
trump
has
chafed
at
any
suggestion
that
the
russian
interference
might
have
helped
him
win
the
white
house
and
while
he
has
long
maligned
mueller
and
the
investigation
his
tweet
on
wednesday
was
an
extraordinary
bid
to
try
to
influence
the
course
of
an
inquiry
hanging
over
his
presidency
in
any
case
sessions
recused
himself
from
the
investigation
in
march
and
does
not
have
the
power
to
stop
it
the
white
house
said
the
tweet
was
not
an
order
to
sessions
and
that
trump
was
expressing
his
frustration
with
the
length
of
the
probe
it
s
not
an
order
it
s
the
president
s
opinion
white
house
spokeswoman
sarah
sanders
told
a
news
briefing
she
denied
that
trump
was
trying
to
obstruct
the
probe
he
s
fighting
back
she
said
trump
s
personal
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
said
trump
was
expressing
an
opinion
long
espoused
by
his
team
some
lawmakers
said
shutting
down
the
investigation
early
would
be
a
mistake
trump
also
said
that
mueller
is
totally
he
provided
no
evidence
that
the
team
led
by
mueller
a
republican
who
was
appointed
by
a
republican
is
biased
against
him
peter
carr
spokesman
for
the
special
counsel
s
office
declined
to
comment
on
trump
s
twitter
post
a
justice
department
spokeswoman
said
the
department
had
no
comment
trump
has
steadily
attacked
sessions
for
recusing
himself
sessions
cited
his
role
as
a
senior
adviser
to
trump
s
presidential
campaign
and
appointed
deputy
attorney
general
rod
rosenstein
to
oversee
the
investigation
rosenstein
in
turn
appointed
mueller
and
is
the
person
with
the
authority
to
fire
him
mueller
a
republican
and
former
fbi
director
who
served
a
republican
and
democratic
president
has
broad
support
in
congress
where
republicans
control
both
chambers
six
republican
senators
going
into
a
vote
on
wednesday
disapproved
of
trump
s
tweet
calling
for
an
end
to
the
probe
they
ought
to
let
them
conclude
their
work
what
they
re
doing
is
something
that
is
important
and
we
support
and
i
don
t
think
any
effort
to
truncate
that
or
somehow
shut
it
down
early
is
in
the
public
s
best
interest
said
senator
john
thune
senator
orrin
hatch
said
he
did
not
think
sessions
had
the
power
to
end
the
probe
and
it
would
be
unwise
to
do
so
an
element
of
mueller
s
investigation
includes
whether
trump
or
anyone
in
the
campaign
tried
to
obstruct
justice
the
new
york
times
reported
last
week
that
mueller
s
office
was
examining
negative
tweets
and
statements
by
trump
about
sessions
and
former
fbi
director
james
comey
trump
fired
comey
in
may
intelligence
agencies
concluded
last
year
that
moscow
meddled
in
the
campaign
to
try
to
tip
the
vote
in
trump
s
favour
moscow
has
denied
such
interference
and
trump
has
denied
any
collusion
by
his
campaign
or
any
obstruction
of
justice
senator
dianne
feinstein
the
top
democrat
on
the
judiciary
committee
said
after
trump
s
tweet
it
s
clear
to
me
he
s
very
worried
about
it
and
he
wants
to
prevent
it
any
way
he
in
april
the
committee
approved
legislation
to
protect
mueller
but
republican
senate
leader
mitch
mcconnell
said
there
was
no
need
to
advance
the
bill
because
he
did
not
believe
trump
would
fire
mueller
some
legal
analysts
said
wednesday
s
tweet
alone
was
not
enough
to
bring
an
obstruction
of
justice
charge
but
it
could
be
used
to
establish
a
pattern
of
conduct
revealing
trump
s
intentions
it
is
a
piece
of
evidence
it
is
part
and
parcel
with
the
other
things
the
man
has
done
that
show
obstruction
of
justice
said
paul
rosenzweig
a
former
prosecutor
who
was
part
of
a
team
that
investigated
president
bill
clinton
jens
david
ohlin
a
law
professor
at
cornell
university
said
the
tweets
would
likely
not
be
seen
as
an
order
to
sessions
but
as
trump
venting
his
continued
frustration
with
the
fact
that
he
can
t
control
