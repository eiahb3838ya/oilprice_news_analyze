red hat jumps, ibm shares dip on cloud mega-merger
reuters
ibm
corp
s
billion
billion
pounds
deal
to
buy
red
hat
inc
drove
shares
in
the
small
but
software
maker
about
percent
higher
on
monday
reflecting
the
huge
premium
ibm
is
paying
to
ward
off
any
potential
challenger
bids
at
shares
of
red
hat
were
still
trading
around
short
of
the
price
agreed
by
the
two
companies
in
sunday
s
announcement
and
analysts
said
that
pointed
to
some
remaining
nerves
among
investors
over
the
chances
of
the
deal
closing
the
breakup
fee
for
the
deal
which
would
be
among
the
largest
on
record
in
the
tech
sector
has
yet
to
be
announced
and
a
high
fee
would
also
deter
red
hat
from
entertaining
other
buyers
ibm
s
stock
was
down
percent
on
news
of
the
deal
a
hint
that
investors
were
concerned
that
at
times
projected
sales
it
had
overpaid
for
the
deal
the
company
s
chief
executive
officer
ginni
rometty
told
cnbc
in
an
interview
aired
early
on
monday
that
she
felt
the
deal
was
done
at
the
right
price
this
is
a
very
fair
price
red
hat
ceo
jim
whitehurst
has
built
a
great
company
and
unlike
others
high
growth
high
profit
and
cash
and
so
this
is
why
i
think
really
those
are
important
things
for
our
investors
rometty
said
one
brokerage
stifel
raised
the
prospect
of
a
competing
offer
from
one
of
the
other
major
players
in
cloud
computing
for
whom
the
deal
represents
the
emergence
of
a
more
substantial
rival
google
amazon
and
microsoft
and
potentially
oracle
have
the
strategic
motivations
and
financial
resources
to
consummate
such
a
transaction
and
would
not
be
surprised
if
we
were
to
see
one
of
them
make
a
competing
bid
analysts
from
stifel
said
in
a
note
rometty
told
reuters
on
sunday
that
the
increasing
use
of
cloud
services
from
multiple
providers
was
the
driving
force
behind
the
deal
along
with
the
rise
of
the
hybrid
cloud
in
which
companies
run
some
of
their
software
in
their
own
data
centres
and
other
elements
of
it
in
data
centres
run
by
ibm
amazon
web
services
or
google
cloud
among
others
red
hat
has
been
investing
heavily
in
tech
tools
such
as
containers
which
make
it
easier
for
businesses
to
split
up
their
computing
work
among
a
mix
of
data
centres
they
want
choice
and
we
are
going
to
give
it
to
them
rometty
said
is
a
fact
of
in
buying
red
hat
ibm
will
have
assembled
a
cloud
that
includes
physical
servers
its
own
operating
system
and
applications
like
human
resources
software
but
the
combined
entity
will
also
sell
software
that
runs
on
its
customers
own
hardware
and
other
clouds
that
will
put
it
in
direct
competition
with
firms
like
microsoft
which
has
a
similar
mix
of
software
and
cloud
services
we
are
going
to
both
compete
and
partner
with
those
other
clouds
rometty
said
the
thing
about
ibm
is
we
ve
been
around
long
enough
to
know
this
is
a
jim
whitehurst
the
ceo
of
red
hat
said
the
use
of
multiple
clouds
has
been
an
advantage
for
red
hat
cloud
providers
such
as
amazon
often
offer
a
version
of
the
linux
operating
system
for
free
or
at
little
cost
but
that
version
of
linux
is
available
only
on
amazon
and
if
the
business
wants
to
run
software
on
another
cloud
they
would
have
to
ensure
it
works
with
a
different
version
of
linux
there
red
hat
offers
a
standard
version
of
linux
that
runs
on
commonly
available
clouds
as
well
as
a
business
s
own
data
centres
and
whitehurst
said
red
hat
customers
were
increasingly
running
its
operating
system
on
public
clouds
we
are
growing
faster
on
the
public
clouds
than
the
public
clouds
are
growing
whitehurst
said
in
an
interview
yeah
you
pay
us
a
little
extra
versus
a
free
cloud
offering
but
you
get
the
benefit
of
a
standard
operating
analysts
had
raised
concerns
that
the
purchase
may
alienate
customers
worrying
that
ibm
will
infringe
on
the
neutrality
of
red
hat
which
is
dubbed
as
switzerland
of
the
it
ibm
reiterated
on
a
conference
call
on
monday
that
red
hat
would
continue
to
be
led
by
whitehurst
and
red
hat
s
current
management
team
it
also
intends
to
maintain
red
hat
s
headquarters
facilities
brands
and
practices
