organisations

in
myanmar
while
suu
kyi
continues
to
inspire
devotion
among
many
ordinary
burmese
the
emergence
of
a
dissenting
youth
movement
driven
by
anger
over
her
handling
of
ethnic
minorities
including
the
muslim
rohingya
as
well
as
curbs
on

and
civil

new
challenge

military
rule
with
a
general

the
country
s
first
civilian
government
in
decades
is
confronted
by
growing
divisions
among
activists
who
once
coalesced
around
her
national
league
for
democracy
party
nld
spokesman
myo
nyunt
said
the
party
was
trying
to
win
over
young
people
increasing
the
budget
for
education
and
supporting
vocational
training
programmes
the
youth
and
the
people
expected
a
lot
from
our
government
he
said
we
couldn
t
live
up
to
their
expectations
we
admit
but
we
are
doing
our
suu
kyi
took
power
in
after
a
landslide
election
win
vowing
to
continue
democratic
reforms
and
end
the
country
s
civil
wars
since
then
the
administration
has
come
under
pressure
over
its
response
to
a
military
crackdown
against
the
rohingya
minority
that
the
united
nations
has
described
as
ethnic
cleansing
with
genocidal
intent
as
well
as
faltering
peace
talks
with
ethnic
armed
groups
and
a
stagnating
economy
activists
say
the
civilian
government
has
also
become
increasingly
authoritarian
failing
to
use
its
overwhelming
parliamentary
majority
to
scrap
laws
used
to
stifle
dissent
while
tightening
restrictions
on
civil
society
in
recent
months
they
have
staged
several
protests
including
an
march
in
the
commercial
capital
of
yangon
in
may
that
ended
in
scuffles
a
total
of
people
were
charged
with
unlawful
protest
including
thinzar
shun
lei
yi
their
trial
is
ongoing
sensitive
issues
are
banned
and
protesters
arrested
and
beaten
she
said
the
national
league
of
democracy
the
party
using
the
name
of

must
respect
democracy
and
human
according
to
free
speech
organization
athan
which
means
voice
in
burmese
journalists
and
activists
have
faced
trial
since
the
suu
kyi
government
took
power
they
include
reuters
reporters
wa

and
kyaw
soe

who
were

convicted
of
breaking
the
colonial
era
official
secrets
act
the
journalists
are
appealing
their
conviction
to
the
country
s
high
court
citing
evidence
of
a
police
and
lack
of
proof
of
a
crime
suu
kyi
said
in
september
their
jailing
had
nothing
to
do
with
freedom
of
expression
the
government
says
myanmar
s
courts
are
independent
athan
s
founder
poet
and
activist
maung
saung
kha
was
among
the
protesters
charged
alongside

shun
lei
yi
in
may
four
months
later
in
september
they
both
helped
organise
another
demonstration
this
time
for
free
speech
facing
the
crowd
maung
saung
kha
who
is
still
an
nld
member
donned
the
orange
shirt
traditionally
worn
by
his
party
s
lawmakers
and
draped
a
green
jacket
resembling
military
garb
over
it
armed
with
a
copy
of
the
daily
newspaper
the
mirror
he
began
beating
journalists
gathered
nearby
the
government
has
failed
to
use
its
power
to
protect
people
s
rights
he
told
reuters
myo
nyunt
the
party
spokesman
said
the
government
was
cooperating
with
organisations
but
their
activities
needed
to
be
examined
if
it
is
not
related
to
security
or
not
a
divisive
issue
among
ethnics
we
accept
them
he
said
we
are
going
forward
to
democracy
so
we
acknowledge
the
role
of
ngos
but
we
have
concerns
that
ngos
are
being
influenced
by
sponsors
instead
of
being
while
she
has
no
control
over
the
military
suu
kyi
has
faced
international
criticism
for
failing
to
defend
the
rohingya
more
than
of
whom
fled
a
sweeping
army
crackdown
in
western
rakhine
state
in
according
to
agencies
the
operation
was
launched
in
response
to
insurgent
rohingya
attacks
on
security
forces
myanmar
denies
almost
all
the
allegations
of
atrocities
made
by
refugees
saying
the
army
was
carrying
out
a
legitimate
campaign
against
terrorists
while
many
among
myanmar
s
buddhist
majority
revile
the
rohingya
the
young
activists
offer
a
rare
sympathetic
voice
we
acknowledge
rohingya
we
totally
denounce
the
fact
that
they
are
referred
to
as
bengali
said
maung
saung
kha
referring
to
a
term
commonly
used
in
myanmar
to
imply
the
rohingya
are
interlopers
from
bangladesh
despite
a
long
history
in
the
country
we
haven
t
seen
any
acknowledgement
or
punishment
for
the
things
that
happened
he
said
the
refugees
will
not
come
back
as
long
as
these
people
think
of
them
as
less
than
humans
and
that
it
is
not
a
crime
to
kill
khin
sandar
another
young
activist
facing
unlawful
protest
charges
spent
months
campaigning
for
the
nld
ahead
of
the
election
but
lost
faith
in
suu
kyi
over
her
handling
of
the
rakhine
crisis
her
family
was
affected
in
a
wave
of
communal
violence
in
when
not
only
rohingya
but
members
of
the
kaman
muslim
minority
who
also
face
discrimination
but
unlike
the
rohingya
are
considered
myanmar
citizens
were
driven
from
their
homes
they
live
in
crowded
internal
displacement
camps
outside
the
rakhine
state
capital
sittwe
and
are
subjected
to
severe
restrictions
on
movement
in
a
speech
after
last
year
s
violence
suu
kyi
said
all
residents
of
rakhine
have
access
to
education
and
healthcare
services
without
discrimination
my
own
nephew
and
nieces
are
still
living
in
the
sittwe
camps
and
they
don
t
have
those
rights
said
khin
sandar
i
was
shocked
how
can
she
say
that
in
her
speech
afterwards
she
said
she
quit
her
job
as
researcher
for
an
nld
lawmaker
while
the
youth
activists
represent
only
a
small
segment
of
myanmar
society
they
are
increasingly
influential
in
the
grassroots
activism
scene
while
their
protests
and
public
comments
have
attracted
significant
attention
from
media
and
from
their
vast
social
media
followings
mostly
in
their
and
they
highlight
the
gulf
between
myanmar
s
young
population
the
median
age
is
and
its
ageing
leadership
comprised
of
mostly
men
in
their
and
myanmar
is
a
very
conservative
country
these
young
people
especially
from
yangon
are
now
challenging
that
said
myat
thu
a
political
analyst
from
the
yangon
school
of
political
science
in
order
to
have
a
revolution
of
ideas
not
many
people
need
to
know
they
will
spread
it
