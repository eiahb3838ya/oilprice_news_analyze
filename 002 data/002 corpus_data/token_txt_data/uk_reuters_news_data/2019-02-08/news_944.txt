chancellor
of
the
exchequer
philip
hammond
said
on
monday
the
united
kingdom
had
the
fiscal
capacity
to
cope
with
leaving
the
european
union
without
any
agreement
but
believed
the
mood
in
brussels
was
to
reach
a
divorce
deal
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
next
march
has
increased
uncertainty
for
employers
with
talks
about
the
future
relationship
between
the
world
s
fifth
largest
economy
and
its
largest
trading
partner
becoming
increasingly
fraught
i
m
clear
that
we
will
have
the
fiscal
capacity
to
support
the
british
economy
if
we
were
unfortunately
to
find
ourselves
in
a
situation
he
told
sky
news
however
hammond
said
the
doubts
about
the
future
had
already
hit
the
economy
and
the
next
few
weeks
would
be
crucial
in
securing
an
agreement
with
the
eu
the
mood
is
undoubtedly
that
people
want
to
do
a
deal
with
the
uk
people
want
to
minimise
the
disruption
of
the
uk
s
departure
from
the
european
union
they
want
to
continue
having
a
relationship
with
us
and
smooth
trading
partnership
in
the
future
he
told
bbc
tv
clearly
there
has
been
a
hit
to
the
economy
through
the
uncertainty
the
brexit
process
has
caused
many
businesses
are
sitting
on
their
hands
frankly
waiting
to
see
what
the
outcome
of
this
negotiation
is
before
confirming
their
investment
reassuring
businesses
they
remain
at
the
heart
of
the
conservatives
party
s
plan
for
the
economy
will
be
the
focus
of
hammond
s
speech
to
his
party
s
conference
on
monday
the
business
community
has
expressed
frustration
over
the
government
s
lack
of
clarity
during
the
brexit
process
and
what
some
see
as
a
decision
to
put
ideology
before
the
economy
we
back
business
as
the
cornerstone
of
a
successful
economy
as
a
force
for
good
in
our
society
and
as
an
essential
expression
of
our
values
hammond
will
say
in
his
speech
to
the
conservative
party
s
annual
conference
in
birmingham
the
british
chambers
of
commerce
said
it
wanted
the
conservatives
to
overcome
their
internal
divisions
and
to
deliver
practical
answers
to
business
s
ongoing
questions
around
brexit
and
avoid
a
messy
and
disorderly
exit
from
the
relations
suffered
earlier
this
year
when
minister
boris
johnson
was
quoted
dismissing
business
leaders
concerns
about
brexit
using
foul
language
in
a
meeting
with
eu
diplomats
johnson
the
bookmakers
favourite
to
succeed
may
has
become
a
cheerleader
for
hardline
brexit
supporters
in
the
conservative
party
who
have
denounced
her
chequers
proposals
and
has
put
forward
his
own
plans
for
an
alternative
free
trade
deal
hammond
said
johnson
s
idea
was
not
on
offer
from
the
eu
what
chequers
does
is
offer
an
solution
down
the
centre
taking
the
best
from
both
models
and
proposing
a
way
forward
which
delivers
on
the
mandate
of
the
british
people
in
the
referendum
but
also
protects
british
jobs
and
british
businesses
he
told
sky
news
last
week
britain
s
opposition
labour
party
sought
to
woo
business
bosses
even
as
it
unveiled
a
raft
of
radical
economic
policies
saying
the
conservatives
had
given
them
the
opportunity
to
pitch
an
alternative
leftist
strategy
despite
brexit
dominating
political
discussions
polls
suggest
it
lags
behind
the
national
health
service
as
britons
greatest
concern
and
hammond
said
people
would
have
to
pay
more
in
tax
to
fund
extra
investment
the
prime
minister
was
very
clear
and
very
honest
with
the
public
that
if
we
want
in
the
future
a
growing
nhs
to
support
our
ageing
population
of
course
we
ll
have
to
accept
a
little
more
tax
to
fund
that
service
