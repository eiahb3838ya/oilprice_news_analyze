position
to
be
the
cdu
s
candidate
for
chancellor
of
europe
s
biggest
economy
in

and
the
outcome
could
even
spell
the
end
of
merkel
s
coalition
with
her
bavarian
allies
and
social
democrats
spd
the
two
front
runners
are
merkel
protege
and
cdu
general
secretary
annegret
who
leads
polls
of
ordinary
voters
and
party
supporters
and
merz
who
bild
am
sonntag
weekly
newspaper
said
is
ahead
among
cdu
delegates
a
majority
for
merz
would
be
the
best
thing
for
the
country
schaeuble
who
was
loyal
to
merkel
as
her
hardline
finance
minister
but
had
previously
been
a
rival
told
the
frankfurter
allgemeine
zeitung
on
wednesday
working
with
merkel
who
wants
to
remain
chancellor
the
new
cdu
leader
will
be
influential
in
shaping
german
domestic
economic
and
foreign
policy
from
relations
with
president
donald
trump
and
russian
president
vladimir
putin
to
helping
shape
the
eu
schaeuble
argued
that
merz
who
lost
out
to
merkel
in
a
power
struggle
in
and
quit
politics
for
business
in
would
be
able
to
boost
the
cdu
by
giving
it
a
stronger
profile
and
working
better
with
its
bavarian
sister
party
merz
an
economic
liberal
on
the
right
of
cdu
has
said
he
wants
to
halve
support
for
the
alternative
for
germany
afd
now
on
about
percent
which
capitalised
on
anger
with
merkel
s
migrant
policy
in
a
dig
at
merkel
s
cautious
approach
schaeuble
said
he
is
a
man
who
sends
clear
signals
with
clear
ideas
who
has
the
courage
not
to
wait
for
the
end
of
a
debate
but
shape
after
deep
rows
with
her
bavarian
allies
in
the
summer
and
heavy
losses
for
the
cdu
in
the
state
of
hesse
in
october
merkel
announced
she
would
stand
down
as
party
leader
but
remain
chancellor
until
the
election
that
may
prove
impossible
merz
a
millionaire
who
has
said
he
wants
bold
steps
to
strengthen
the
economic
and
monetary
union
has
said
he
respects
merkel
who
has
pulled
the
cdu
into
the
political
centre
ground
and
would
work
with
her
many
commentators
are
sceptical
and
it
is
also
unclear
if
the
spd
also
desperate
to
boost
its
poll
ratings
which
have
slumped
to
about
percent
could
work
with
him
with
the
more
centrist
a
former
premier
of
the
tiny
state
of
saarland
cooperation
with
merkel
and
the
spd
would
be
easier
she
insists
she
is
not
a
merkel
clone
but
there
is
scant
evidence
she
would
break
with
merkel
s
main
policies
the
third
candidate
trailing
in
all
the
polls
is
health
minister
jens
spahn
a
harsh
critic
of
merkel
s
migrant
policy
with
many
of
the
delegates
undecided
commentators
say
the
speeches
given
by
the
candidates
at
a
party
conference
in
hamburg
on
friday
before
the
vote
could
be
crucial
