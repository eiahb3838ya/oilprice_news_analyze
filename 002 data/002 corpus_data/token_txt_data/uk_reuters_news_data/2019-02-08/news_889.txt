norwegian
has
been
rapidly
expanding
in
the
transatlantic
market
over
the
last
five
years
prompting
the
owner
of
british
airways
iag
to
try
to
buy
it
earlier
this
year
the

four
airlines
led
by

are
the
biggest
carriers
of

norwegian

that
can
be
as
little
as
half
those
charged
by
traditional

the

have
responded
by
selling
a
new
budget
class
of
ticket
as
well
as
setting

new
airline
level
to
compete
directly
with
norwegian
on

our
commitment
to
new

is
as
strong
as
ever
a

spokeswoman
said
we
fly
up

norwegian
said
in
may
it
had
rejected
two
approaches
from
iag
which
also
owns
the
iberia
aer
lingus
and
vueling
brands
because
they
undervalued
the
company
iag
owns
a

stake
in

growth
figures
from

show
it
only

it
faces
mounting
pressure
to
control
costs
and
shore
up
its
balance
sheet
fares
have
been
too
high
for
too
long
as
transatlantic
routes
have
been
long
dominated
by
carriers
with
outdated
legacies
running
on
fumes
a
norwegian
spokesman
said
norwegian
will
continue
to
spread
its
wings
to
the
big
apple
with
