ryanair
is
to
end
its
practice
of
allowing
passengers
to
take
a
piece
of
hand
luggage
for
free
and
will
charge
between
and
euros
for
the
service
from
november
under
the
new
rules
passengers
will
still
be
allowed
to
take
one
small
personal
bag
on
board
to
be
placed
under
the
seat
in
front
but
if
a
passenger
wants
to
bring
a
suitcase
of
up
to
they
will
now
have
to
pay
they
can
pay
between
and
euros
to
take
it
on
board
and
put
it
in
the
overhead
locker
or
pay
between
and
euros
to
check
it
in
the
airline
said
it
was
making
the
change
as
planes
were
being
delayed
as
passengers
brought
too
much
hand
luggage
rivals
easyjet
wizz
and
norwegian
air
shuttle
currently
all
allow
a
piece
of
hand
luggage
for
free

flights
ryanair
said
it
does
not
expect
to
make
additional
revenue
as
checking
in
a
bag
under
the
new
system
is
significantly
cheaper
than
the
current
cost
of
checking
in
a
bag
it
also
said
it
was
increasing
the
size
allowed
for
all
bags
