momentum gathers behind british mps' bid to stop no-deal brexit
london
reuters
an
attempt
by
british
lawmakers
to
prevent
a
brexit
was
gaining
momentum
on
wednesday
after
the
opposition
labour
party
said
it
was
likely
to
throw
its
parliamentary
weight
behind
that
the
united
kingdom
facing
the
deepest
political
crisis
since
world
war
two
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
at
gmt
on
march
but
has
no
approved
deal
on
how
the
divorce
will
take
place
prime
minister
theresa
may
is
battling
to
break
the
deadlock
after
last
week
s
crushing
defeat
of
her
attempt
to
forge
an
orderly
divorce
raised
the
prospect
of
an
exit
without
a
deal
in
a
step
that
could
overturn
centuries
of
constitutional
convention
some
mps
are
trying
to
grab
control
of
brexit
from
the
government
in
an
attempt
to
prevent
what
they
say
would
be
an
economically
disastrous
departure
labour
will
probably
back
one
such
attempt
an
amendment
proposed
by
labour
lawmaker
yvette
cooper
that
could
result
in
may
being
given
until
to
get
a
deal
approved
by
parliament
or
face
mps
voting
on
delaying
brexit
john
mcdonnell
the
second
most
powerful
figure
in
the
party
told
the
bbc
the
amendment
was
sensible
and
labour
was
highly
likely
to
back
it
at
least
nine
conservative
mps
have
also
publicly
said
they
will
support
it
suggesting
it
has
a
good
chance
of
passing
sterling
jumped
to
a
high
against
the
dollar
rising
to
on
bets
that
a
brexit
can
be
avoided
if
parliament
exerts
greater
control
over
the
process
as
the
united
kingdom
s
tortuous
crisis
over
eu
membership
approaches
its
finale
the
possible
outcomes
for
the
world
s
fifth
largest
economy
still
include
a
brexit
a
deal
a
delay
or
a
snap
election
but
the
eu
whose
members
are
also
worried
by
the
prospect
of
a
disorderly
brexit
that
would
cost
jobs
in
major
economies
such
as
germany
cautioned
that
was
still
the
default
scenario
until
london
proposed
something
else
preparing
for
a
scenario
is
more
important
now
than
ever
even
though
i
still
hope
that
we
can
avoid
this
scenario
eu
brexit
negotiator
michel
barnier
said
in
brussels
opposing
will
not
stop
from
happening
he
said
adding
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
british
to
find
a
majority
in
favour
of
another
solution
to
a
disorderly
exit
europe
s
most
powerful
leader
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
she
wanted
an
orderly
brexit
but
that
it
was
in
london
s
hands
may
has
said
thwarting
brexit
would
threaten
social
cohesion
by
undermining
faith
in
democracy
while
police
have
said
the
febrile
atmosphere
could
be
exploited
by
extremists
another
alternative
is
that
may
gets
enough
concessions
from
the
eu
to
win
over
rebels
in
her
conservative
party
as
well
as
the
northern
irish
party
that
props
up
her
minority
government
some
said
they
could
be
won
over
if
may
secures
concessions
on
the
northern
irish
backstop
an
insurance
policy
to
keep
the
border
open
between
the
british
province
and
ireland
if
a
future
trade
deal
falls
short
i
think
there
is
good
news
for
us
to
hope
that
a
reformation
of
this
deal
could
be
achieved
that
could
make
it
acceptable
lawmaker
jacob
said
but
it
is
not
there
yet
and
until
it
is
people
like
me
will
vote
parliament
will
vote
on
on
different
options
put
forward
by
mps
potentially
opening
a
way
out
of
the
stalemate
a
labour
spokesman
said
the
party
would
look
at
all
mechanisms
to
take
no
deal
off
the
table
and
to
give
parliament
more
of
a
say
in
this
process
and
that
leader
jeremy
corbyn
was
meeting
cooper
on
wednesday
to
discuss
the
amendment
if
her
amendment
is
passed
it
would
effectively
give
parliament
the
power
to
set
may
a
deadline
of
to
get
a
deal
through
parliament
if
may
fails
parliament
would
be
given
a
vote
on
asking
the
eu
for
a
postponement
of
the
article
deadline
to
prevent
britain
leaving
without
a
deal
on
march
it
proposes
a
extension
to
if
britain
asked
to
delay
its
departure
under
article
the
other
eu
members
would
need
to
unanimously
approve
such
a
move
something
eu
officials
say
would
be
likely
to
be
granted
if
this
question
is
presented
they
will
have
questions
for
the
british
government
what
is
it
for
what
is
the
purpose
for
how
long
barnier
said
may
told
parliament
the
move
would
not
solve
the
issue
of
the
impasse
in
parliament
what
we
have
seen
is
amendments
seeking
to
engineer
a
situation
where
article
is
extended
that
does
not
solve
the
issue
there
will
always
be
a
point
of
decision
the
decision
remains
the
same
no
deal
a
deal
or
no
brexit
