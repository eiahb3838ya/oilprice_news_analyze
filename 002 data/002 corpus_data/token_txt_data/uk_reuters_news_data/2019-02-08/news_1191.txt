has
been
criticised
for
failing

it
s
important
to
remember
that

is
awarded
for
some
effort
or
achievement
of
the
past

said
and
the
rules
regulating
the
nobel

do
not
allow

withdrawn
he
added
the
norwegian
nobel
committee
consists
of
a
panel
of
five
norwegians
mostly
former

academics
that

award
after
previous
criticism
of
aung
san
suu
kyi
s
role
in
the
rohingya
crisis
we
don
t
do
it
it
s
not
our
task
to
oversee
or
censor
what
a
laureate
does
after
the
prize
has
been
won
she
said
in
a
television
interview
the
prize
winners
themselves
have
to
safeguard
their
