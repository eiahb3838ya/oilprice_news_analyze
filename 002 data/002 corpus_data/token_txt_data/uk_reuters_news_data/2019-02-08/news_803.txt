hundreds
of
thousands
of
supporters
of
the
european
union
marched
through
london
on
saturday
in
the
biggest
demonstration
so
far
to
demand
that
the
british
government
holds
a
public
vote
on
the
terms
of
brexit
the
protesters
waved
the
blue
and
gold
flag
of
the
eu
and
held
up
bollocks
to
brexit
banners
under
sunny
skies
to
call
for
another
referendum
on
the
eventual
deal
on
how
britain
will
leave
the
world
s
biggest
trading
bloc
the
march
comes
after
another
tumultuous
week
for
prime
minister
theresa
may
in
which
she
failed
to
agree
a
divorce
deal
with
eu
leaders
in
brussels
and
infuriated
members
of
her
own
party
by
making
further
concessions
in
the
talks
with
just
over
five
months
until
britain
is
due
to
leave
there
is
no
clarity
about
what
a
future
trade
deal
with
the
eu
will
look
like
and
some
rebels
in
may
s
conservative
party
have
threatened
to
vote
down
a
deal
if
she
clinches
one
james
mcgrory
one
of
the
organisers
of
the
march
said
voters
should
have
the
chance
to
change
their
minds
because
the
decision
will
impact
their
lives
for
generations
people
think
the
brexit
negotiations
are
a
total
mess
they
have
no
faith
in
the
government
to
deliver
the
promises
that
were
made
partly
because
they
can
not
be
delivered
he
said
at
the
march
demonstrators
carried
placards
saying
brexit
is
pants
time
for
an
eu
turn
and
european
and
organisers
said
about
people
took
part
in
the
march
which
would
make
it
the
largest
in
britain
since
a
demonstration
against
the
iraq
war
in
the
people
s
vote
campaign
which
includes
several
groups
said
they
had
stewards
stationed
at
regular
intervals
to
estimate
the
size
of
the
crowd
the
police
did
not
provide
an
independent
estimate
of
numbers
participating
protesters
originally
gathered
near
hyde
park
and
then
walked
past
downing
street
and
finished
outside
parliament
where
they
listened
to
politicians
from
all
main
political
parties
britain
s
referendum
saw
percent
vote
in
favour
of
leaving
the
european
union
but
the
past
two
years
have
been
politically
fraught
as
the
government
has
struggled
to
agree
on
a
plan
and
there
are
fears
that
britain
could
leave
the
bloc
without
a
deal
some
opinion
polls
have
shown
a
slight
shift
in
favour
of
remaining
in
the
european
union
but
there
has
yet
to
be
a
decisive
change
in
attitudes
and
many
in
britain
say
they
have
become
increasingly
bored
by
brexit
the
prime
minister
has
repeatedly
ruled
out
holding
a
second
referendum
the
opposition
labour
party
s
brexit
spokesman
said
last
month
his
party
open
to
a
second
referendum
with
the
option
of
staying
in
the
bloc
in
certain
circumstances
in
belfast
in
northern
ireland
around
people
gathered
on
saturday
to
oppose
brexit
brendan
heading
a
it
worker
said
he
was
worried
the
decision
to
leave
the
eu
would
damage
the
economy
and
could
lead
to
the
break
up
of
the
united
kingdom
i
feel
that
brexit
threatens
prosperity
and
stability
he
said
people
should
have
the
opportunity
to
vote
for
an
alternative
based
on
what
we
now
brexit
supporters
held
their
own
rally
in
the
town
of
harrogate
in
the
north
of
england
richard
tice
of
leave
means
leave
and
one
of
the
speakers
at
the
event
described
the
people
on
the
march
in
london
as
losers
and
said
a
second
referendum
would
trigger
a
constitutional
crisis
we
had
a
vote
we
voted
to
leave
the
idea
to
have
a
second
referendum
would
be
incredibly
damaging
he
said
people
need
to
be
under
no
illusions
as
to
how
people
feel
about
what
is
a
significant
potential
for
a
total
betrayal

democracy
