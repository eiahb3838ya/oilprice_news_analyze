washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
plans
to
sign
an
executive
order
as
soon
as
wednesday
that
will
slap
sanctions
on
any
foreign
companies
or
people
who
interfere
in
elections
based
on
intelligence
agency
findings
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
trump
s
decision
coincides
with
intelligence
agencies
military
and
law
enforcement
preparing
to
defend
the
congressional
elections
from
predicted
foreign
attacks
even
as
trump
derides
a
special
counsel
investigation
into
russian
interference
in
the
elections
the
white
house
declined
to
comment
sanction
targets
could
include
individual
people
or
entire
companies
accused
of
interfering
in
elections
by
cyber
attacks
or
other
means
a
official
told
reuters
the
administration
is
keen
to
set
a
new
norm
in
cyberspace
the
official
said
this
is
a
first
step
in
stating
boundaries
and
publicly
announcing
our
response
for
bad
the
order
represents
the
latest
in
a
series
of
trump
administration
efforts
to
look
tough
on
election
security
before
voting
in
november
that
will
decide
whether
trump
s
republican
party
can
keep
its
majorities
in
both
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
the
order
will
put
a
range
of
agencies
in
charge
of
deciding
if
meddling
occurred
led
by
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
and
including
the
cia
the
national
security
agency
and
the
homeland
security
department
the
sources
said
based
on
a
recent
draft
of
the
order
reviewed
by
the
official
it
will
require
any
federal
agency
aware
of
election
interference
by
foreigners
to
take
the
information
to
the
office
of
director
of
national
intelligence
election
interference
will
be
defined
in
the
order
as
hacking
attempts
against
election
infrastructure
and
efforts
to
sway
public
opinion
through
coordinated
digital
propaganda
or
systematic
leaks
of
private
political
information
intelligence
officials
have
found
that
in
the
campaign
leading
up
to
the
presidential
election
russian
hackers
breached
the
democratic
national
committee
and
leaked
confidential
information
the
washington
post
and
the
wall
street
journal
previously
reported
on
earlier
drafts
of
the
executive
order
congress
has
been
purposefully
left
out
of
the
executive
order
drafting
process
the
official
said
because
the
administration
wants
to
preempt
legislation
being
considered
in
the
house
and
senate
that
addresses
similar
issues
lawmakers
have
introduced
various
pieces
of
legislation
including
the
deter
act
to
set
out
punishments
for
election
meddling
and
what
one
lawmaker
called
a
sanctions
bill
from
hell
to
punish
moscow
for
cyber
crime
and
its
activities
in
syria
ukraine
and
elsewhere
both
democrats
and
republicans
are
looking
to
redress
what
they
consider
trump
s
weak
stance
on
accusations
of
russian
interference
in
when
he
met
russian
president
vladimir
putin
at
a
summit
in
july
trump
stunned
the
world
by
accepting
putin
s
denials
over
the
word
of
his
own
intelligence
agencies
congress
passed
a
russia
sanctions
bill
more
than
a
year
ago
some
lawmakers
including
some
republicans
as
well
as
democrats
have
chafed
at
what
they
saw
as
the
administration
s
reluctance
to
implement
it
trump
signed
the
bill
only
after
congress
passed
it
with
huge
majorities
acting
on
that
law
the
treasury
imposed
major
sanctions
against
russians
striking
at
allies
of
putin
in
one
of
washington
s
most
aggressive
moves
to
punish
moscow
