vienna
reuters
a
european
union
tax
overhaul
to
raise
levies
on
large
digital
firms
needs
a
thorough
debate
although
an
agreement
could
still
be
found
by
the
end
of
the
year
germany
s
finance
minister
olaf
scholz
said
on
saturday
under
a
proposal
from
the
european
commission
in
march
eu
states
would
charge
a
percent
levy
on
digital
revenues
of
large
firms
like
google
and
facebook
that
are
accused
of
routing
their
profits
to
the
bloc
s
states
the
plan
is
opposed
by
smaller
states
like
ireland
who
fear
losing
revenues
and
by
nordic
governments
who
think
the
tax
could
stifle
innovation
and
trigger
retaliation
from
the
united
states
which
is
home
to
most
of
the
firms
who
could
be
hit
by
the
proposed
tax
it
is
necessary
to
take
some
time
for
debate
scholz
told
reporters
at
a
vienna
meeting
of
eu
finance
ministers
adding
that
he
aimed
at
reaching
a
compromise
by
the
year
end
after
having
pushed
for
the
tax
berlin
took
a
more
cautious
approach
after
scholz
took
office
in
march
and
his
latest
remark
will
be
closely
scrutinized
by
european
union
governments
who
oppose
the
new
tax
as
it
may
be
perceived
as
showing
germany
s
little
appetite
to
the
project
eu
officials
said
germany
wants
to
make
sure
the
tax
does
not
damage
its
carmakers
who
could
face
retaliatory
measures
from
international
partners
or
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
new
taxation
if
their
digital
revenues
increased
french
finance
minister
bruno
le
maire
one
of
the
main
supporters
of
the
new
levy
tried
to
facilitate
a
compromise
by
offering
to
add
a
sunset
clause
to
the
european
union
tax
under
his
proposal
the
new
tax
would
end
once
a
deal
is
reached
at
global
level
on
the
taxation
of
digital
companies
the
clause
was
seen
as
a
progress
by
eu
partners
there
will
be
a
sunset
clause
austrian
finance
minister
hartwig
loeger
said
at
the
end
of
the
eu
meeting
the
eu
plan
already
foresees
that
the
percent
levy
would
be
only
a
temporary
solution
until
a
global
deal
is
reached
le
maire
s
proposal
makes
clearer
that
the
tax
has
an
expiry
date
france
is
also
willing
to
consider
ways
to
compensate
ireland
for
possible
lost
revenue
french
officials
said
on
saturday
however
asked
about
this
offer
and
other
possible
compensations
irish
finance
minister
paschal
donohoe
remained
cautious
and
insisted
on
a
global
deal
as
the
best
solution
an
overhaul
of
digital
taxation
has
been
for
long
under
discussion
at
global
level
but
no
compromise
is
in
sight
as
large
differences
remain
among
rich
nations
eu
tax
reforms
require
the
backing
of
all
its
member
states
to
be
adopted
austria
who
is
holding
the
eu
s
rotating
presidency
is
working
to
find
a
compromise
by
the
end
of
the
year
it
has
proposed
reducing
the
scope
of
the
tax
which
would
no
longer
be
applied
to
the
sale
of
users
data
as
in
the
commission
proposal
only
revenue
from
online
advertising
services
in
which
google
and
facebook
excel
and
from
virtual
marketplaces
such
as
amazon
would
be
subject
to
the
new
tax
eleven
eu
states
are
already
planning
national
web
taxes
which
are
likely
to
be
adopted
if
no
eu
solution
is
agreed
