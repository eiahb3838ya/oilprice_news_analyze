in
with
his

kate
and
brother
harry
we
went

nobody
before
we
started
was
interested
in
being
a
part
of
heads
together
because
it
was
mental
health
he
said
speaking
on
a
panel
at
the
world
economic
forum
in
the
swiss
resort
of
davos
william
who
is
second
in
line
to
the
british
throne
also
opened
up
about
his
experiences
of
dealing
with
trauma
during
his
daily
work
in
the
air
ambulance
which

ago
remembering
a
particularly
affecting
incident
he

if
i
hadn
t
taken
the
action

different
his
fellow

new

s
prime
minister
jacinda

said
she
will
introduce
new

s
first
budget

how
policy
impacts
the
quality

s
lives
i
think
unfortunately
one
of
the

life
we

have
to
look
far
in
my
cabinet
to
find
others
who

well
ardern
added
william
who
has
previously
warned
british
men
of
the
dangers
of
keeping
a
traditional
stiff

said
he
thought
his
country

difficulties
with
expressing
emotions
came
from
a
wartime

he
thought

the
davos
crowd

think
more
leaders
need
to
talk
