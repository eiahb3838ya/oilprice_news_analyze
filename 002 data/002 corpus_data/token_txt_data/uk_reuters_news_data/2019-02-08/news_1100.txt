the
vatican
is
preparing
a
response
to
bombshell
allegations
made
by
an
italian
archbishop
who
asked
pope
francis
to
step
down
accusing
him
of
covering
up
sexual
misconduct
by
an
american
cardinal
his
top
advisers
said
on
monday
the
statement
came
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
of
a
meeting
of
the
a
group
of
nine
cardinals
from
around
the
world
who
meet
with
the
pope
at
the
vatican
several
times
a
year
to
advise
him
on
church
matters
in
an
statement
published
on
archbishop
carlo
maria
viganò
the
former
vatican
ambassador
to
washington
launched
an
unprecedented
broadside
by
a
church
insider
against
the
pope
and
a
long
list
of
vatican
and
church
officials
the
cardinals
statement
said
they
had
expressed
their
total
solidarity
with
the
pope
over
events
of
the
last
few
weeks
and
added
that
the
holy
see
was
preparing
eventual
and
necessary
clarifications
viganò
said
he
had
told
francis
soon
after
the
pontiff
s
election
in
that
theodore
mccarrick
the
former
archbishop
of
washington
had
engaged
in
sexual
misconduct
viganò
who
is
in
hiding
and
communicating
through
the
same
conservative
journalists
who
helped
him
prepare
edit
and
distribute
his
broadside
said
the
pope
had
done
nothing
and
even
lifted
sanctions
that
had
been
imposed
on
mccarrick
by
benedict
the
previous
pope
francis
in
july
accepted
the
resignation
of
mccarrick
who
became
the
first
cardinal
in
living
memory
to
lose
his
red
hat
and
title
american
church
officials
had
said
allegations
that
mccarrick
had
sexually
abused
a
boy
almost
years
ago
were
credible
and
substantiated
mccarrick
has
said
he
has
absolutely
no
recollection
of
the
alleged
abuse
of
the
teenager
critics
say
viganò
s
statement
has
holes
and
contradictions
and
is
his
vendetta
for
not
being
made
a
cardinal
by
francis
they
say
mccarrick
disregarded
any
sanctions
appearing
in
public
often
even
alongside
benedict
in
the
years
after
viganò
says
the
former
pope
acted
against
mccarrick
hours
after
viganò
s
statement
was
printed
in
conservative
media
outlets
francis
told
reporters
on
his
plane
returning
from
a
trip
to
ireland
that
he
would
not
say
a
word
about
the
statement
because
it
speaks
for
itself
he
did
not
however
rule
out
an
institutional
response
such
as
the
one
the
cardinals
said
the
vatican
was
preparing
the
cardinals
statement
gave
no
indication
when
the
clarification
would
be
issued
the
cardinals
also
said
they
had
asked
the
pope
to
reflect
on
the
work
structure
and
of
the
group
that
was
formed
five
years
ago
taking
into
consideration
the
advanced
age
of
some
of
its
francis
spoke
of
his
intention
to
make
changes
to
the
in
an
exclusive
interview
with
reuters
in
june
saying
he
wanted
to
renew
it
a
bit
two
of
the
members
of
the
current
australian
cardinal
george
pell
and
chilean
cardinal
francisco
javier
errázuriz
