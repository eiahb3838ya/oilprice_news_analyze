london
reuters
britain
s
opposition
labour
party
is
not
prepared
to
hold
substantive
talks
with
prime
minister
theresa
may
on
the
way
forward
on
brexit
until
she
takes
the
option
of
no
deal
off
the
table
a
spokesman
said
on
wednesday
may
earlier
said
she
had
invited
parliamentary
party
leaders
to
meet
her
on
wednesday
evening
to
try
to
break
the
deadlock
over
brexit
after
her
government
won
a
vote
of
confidence
from
mps
of
course
labour
leader
jeremy
is
prepared
to
meet
the
prime
minister
but
if
we
re
talking
about
substantive
talks
on
how
to
resolve
the
crisis
over
brexit
then
the
starting
point
for
that
needs
to
be
that
no
deal
comes
off
the
table
the
spokesman
told
reporters
labour
s
alternative
plan
which
is
based
around
a
customs
union
and
a
strong
single
market
deal
is
the
basis
of
a
workable
alternative
and
could
command
a
majority
in
parliament
and
is
the
right
deal
for
the
country
if
the
government
comes
forward
with
such
a
deal
we
will
support
