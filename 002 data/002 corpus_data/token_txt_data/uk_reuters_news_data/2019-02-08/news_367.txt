european
union
leaders
arrive
in
brussels
for
two
days
of
talks
on
brexit
the
euro
zone
migration
and
russia
among
others
below
are
some
of
their
comments
made
on
arrival
we
can
have
a
political
discussion
tonight
but
the
legal
framework
and
the
agreement
that
were
negotiated
are
not
supposed
to
it
s
important
to
avoid
any
ambiguity
we
can
not
reopen
a
legal
agreement
we
can
t
renegotiate
what
was
negotiated
for
several
it
s
up
to
theresa
may
to
tell
us
what
political
solution
she
expects
to
pursue
to
find
a
majority
for
this
the
kind
of
things
that
we
talked
about
was
how
we
might
give
the
uk
government
a
greater
assurance
that
the
future
relationship
treaty
will
actually
be
negotiated
in
an
expeditious
manner
and
will
be
negotiated
and
agreed
long
before
we
d
have
to
consider
things
such
as
the
extension
to
the
transition
period
or
the
implementation
of
the
in
that
space
we
all
accept
that
the
backstop
is
the
backstop
it
s
an
insurance
policy
nobody
wants
us
to
have
to
invoke
it
and
if
it
is
invoked
we
want
to
make
sure
that
it
s
only
for
as
short
a
period
as
if
the
backstop
has
an
expiry
date
if
there
is
a
unilateral
exit
clause
this
is
not
a
backstop
that
would
be
to
render
it
inoperable
that
would
mean
reopening
the
substance
of
the
withdrawal
agreement
and
the
european
union
is
unequivocal
that
this
is
not
an
the
objective
here
is
to
get
this
agreement
the
united
kingdom
is
leaving
the
european
union
any
agreement
that
deals
with
the
withdrawal
has
to
be
an
agreement
between
the
eu
and
the
uk
ireland
is
europe
when
it
comes
to
these
what
we
want
is
an
enduring
assurance
that
there
will
not
be
a
hard
border
between
northern
ireland
and
the
republic
of
ireland
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
that
an
assurance
that
the
uk
government
gave
us
over
a
year
ago
the
withdrawal
agreement
puts
that
into
law
and
now
we
d
like
to
see
that
agreement
it
s
within
the
gift
of
the
uk
government
and
the
uk
parliament
to
take
the
threat
of
off
the
table
it
impossible
if
the
uk
wishes
to
revoke
the
article
to
seek
an
extension
of
the
article
so
that
the
uk
parliament
has
more
time
to
come
together
and
decide
what
they
would
like
the
outcome
to
it
seems
to
me
there
is
majority
in
westminster
in
favour
of
the
proposition
that
there
shouldn
t
be
a
no
brexit
christmas
wish
finally
decide
what
you
really
want
and
santa
will
deliver
she
said
on
twitter
in
posting
a
picture
of
a
chocolate
christmas
tree
i
think
the
withdrawal
agreement
has
been
negotiated
very
we
have
our
principles
and
i
do
not
see
how
the
withdrawal
agreement
can
be
changed
we
can
see
if
there
are
additional
assurances
but
in
this
the
eu
member
states
are
together
and
make
their
interests
we
want
very
very
good
relations
with
great
britain
after
great
britain
has
left
the
european
we
are
prepared
to
accommodate
theresa
i
think
we
have
a
good
deal
my
impression
is
that
on
the
british
side
people
have
not
yet
understood
that
this
is
a
good
it
is
impossible
to
open
the
negotiated
withdrawal
agreement
that
is
now
a
given
there
is
nobody
in
their
right
mind
in
europe
who
wants
to
use
the
the
uk
decided
to
leave
the
eu
to
draw
these
red
given
brexit
given
the
red
lines
this
deal
is
now
on
the
we
can
not
break
open
or
start
to
the
withdrawal
agreement
then
it
is
about
clarification
the
question
is
what
language
you
put
in
this
clarification
this
is
all
up
for
today
is
about
this
whole
northern
ireland
backstop
nobody
in
the
eu
wants
to
use
it
but
we
need
to
have
how
to
make
that
clarification
on
paper
that
s
something
we
have
to
look
at
q
would
eu
extend
article
a
if
and
when
it
s
up
to
the
uk
to
ask
for
that
at
the
moment
no
such
thing
is
on
the
i
am
sure
that
both
sides
we
need
the
agreement
the
united
kingdom
and
also
the
european
we
want
to
help
first
of
all
our
goal
is
that
the
new
relationship
is
ready
before
the
backstop
enters
into
force
legally
binding
will
be
a
bit
difficult
let
s
see
if
we
can
find
something
from
the
legal
side
as
i
recognise
the
strength
of
concern
in
the
house
of
commons
and
that
is
what
i
will
be
putting
to
colleagues
i
don
t
expect
an
immediate
breakthrough
but
what
i
do
hope
is
that
we
can
start
work
as
quickly
as
possible
on
the
assurances
that
are
i
said
that
in
my
heart
i
would
love
to
able
to
lead
the
conservative
party
into
the
next
general
election
but
i
think
it
is
right
that
the
party
feels
it
would
prefer
to
go
into
that
election
with
a
new
i
will
be
seeking
the
legal
and
political
assurances
i
believe
we
we
will
clarify
certain
points
we
will
not
renegotiate
the
whole
document
i
am
happy
that
mrs
may
received
support
yesterday
because
otherwise
we
would
have
been
heading
towards
a
no
you
should
not
forget
that
the
whole
referendum
was
based
on
lies
there
were
so
many
people
who
said
that
billions
of
euros
would
come
back
from
brussels
into
the
health
service
i
would
be
not
against
it
if
theresa
may
said
rather
a
second
referendum
than
a
no
deal
this
idea
that
you
could
just
leave
europe
in
a
mere
click
of
the
fingers
and
that
you
would
only
get
benefits
a
win
for
the
uk
and
a
loss
for
the
rest
of
the
world
we
see
that
s
not
the
we
are
ready
to
the
council
will
confirm
our
strong
position
and
our
demand
for
russia
to
release
the
vessels
and
the
we
ll
reaffirm
not
only
our
strong
support
to
territorial
integrity
and
sovereignty
of
ukraine
but
also
our
strong
policy
of
of
the
annexation
of
the
crimean
peninsula
and
a
very
substantial
package
of
support
to
ukraine
that
the
eu
has
put
in
place
so
far
and
is
ready
to
we
must
support
ukraine
and
the
people
of
ukraine
we
must
support
ukraine
s
territorial
integrity
and
it
is
fully
unacceptable
that
the
flow
of
migrants
to
europe
is
managed
by
smuggler
we
have
to
help
north
african
countries
in
a
way
like
we
did
with
turkey
we
have
to
help
individual
african
countries
we
want
to
help
them
improve
their
lives
at
this
is
not
the
time
to
enter
a
debate
on
france
we
are
in
the
process
of
fighting
this
is
not
a
good
moment
to
discuss
other
it
is
not
for
us
to
say
what
should
be
done

internal
