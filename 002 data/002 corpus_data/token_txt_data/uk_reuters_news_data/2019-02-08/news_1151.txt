syria
could
be
spared
its
bloodiest
battle
yet
if
the
russian
and
turkish
presidents
talk
to
each
other
urgently
about
resolving
the
situation
in
the
region
of
idlib
syria
envoy
staffan
de
mistura
said
on
tuesday
de
mistura
said
that
talks
between
russia
and
turkey
held
the
key
to
averting
an
assault
on
the
region
of
million
people
but
six
reported
air
strikes
on
tuesday
suggested
the
ankara
talks
were
not
going
well
media
reports
had
said
the
syrian
government
might
wait
until
before
launching
an
assault
making
a
summit
to
be
held
between
russia
turkey
and
iran
on
friday
crucial
he
said
if
true
the
rumour
we
are
hearing
there
is
a
plan
to
actually
start
moving
and
increasing
the
escalation
militarily
on
the
the
time
is
of
essence
he
said
de
mistura
made
an
appeal
via
the
media
to
russian
president
vladimir
putin
and
turkey
s
tayyip
erdogan
a
telephone
call
between
the
two
of
you
would
make
a
big
difference
he
said
we
therefore
ask
for
more
time
to
be
given
for
negotiations
especially
between
russia
and
turkey
who
are
the
main
stakeholders
who
are
talking
and
do
hold
in
my
opinion
the
key
for
a
soft
solution
he
added
de
mistura
called
for
protected
civilian
evacuation
routes
to
allow
idlib
residents
to
leave
the
city
voluntarily
accompanied
by
personnel
president
donald
trump
warned
syrian
president
bashar
and
his
allies
iran
and
russia
on
monday
not
to
recklessly
attack
idlib
warning
that
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
could
be
killed
de
mistura
noting
that
trump
s
tweet
used
the
word
humanitarian
twice
said
it
sent
the
right
message
the
top
military
officer
warned
on
tuesday
that
a
major
syrian
military
assault
on
idlib
would
lead
to
a
humanitarian
catastrophe
and
instead
recommended
more
narrowly
tailored
operations
against
militants
there
there
is
indeed
intense
humanitarian
and
political
diplomacy
now
surrounding
idlib
said
jan
egeland
de
mistura
s
humanitarian
adviser
and
if
it
succeeds
we
will
have
hundreds
of
thousands
of
lives
spared
if
it
fails
in
the
next
days
and
hours
we
could
see
a
battle
more
cruel
than
any
previous
battle
in
this
the
cruellest
war
of
our
generation
