london
reuters
the
royal
mail
has
been
fined
million
pounds
for
discriminating
against
whistl
its
only
major
competitor
delivering
letters
regulator
ofcom
said
on
tuesday
royal
mail
changed
wholesale
customers
contracts
in
early
when
whistl
was
set
to
become
the
first
company
to
challenge
its
monopoly
in
the
delivery
of
bulk
mail
as
a
result
whistl
suspended
plans
to
extend
delivery
services
to
new
parts
of
the
uk
ofcom
said
royal
mail
broke
the
law
by
abusing
its
dominant
position
in
bulk
mail
delivery
said
jonathan
oxley
ofcom
s
competition
group
director
all
companies
must
play
by
the
rules
royal
mail
s
behaviour
was
unacceptable
and
it
denied
postal
users
the
potential
benefits
that
come
from
effective
royal
mail
said
it
would
appeal
the
fine
which
is
the
biggest
ever
imposed
by
the
regulator
royal
mail
strongly
refutes
any
suggestion
that
it
has
acted
in
breach
of
the
competition
act
and
considers
that
the
decision
is
without
merit
and
fundamentally
flawed
it
said
royal
mail
which
was
privatised
in
said
the
wholesale
price
changes
were
designed
to
support
the
sustainability
of
the
universal
service
its
obligation
to
deliver
to
all
uk
destinations
for
the
same
charge
as
competitors
cherry
picked
profitable
urban
areas
for
delivery
whistl
had
been
trying
to
compete
with
royal
mail
in
delivering
bulk
mail
such
as
utility
bills
and
bank
statements
direct
to
addresses
in
some
urban
areas
while
still
using
royal
mail
for
final
deliveries
elsewhere
royal
mail
also
said
it
would
challenge
the
ruling
on
the
basis
that
for
an
allegation
of
abusive
price
discrimination
to
be
established
the
relevant
prices
must
actually
be
paid
and
it
said
the
party
paying
such
prices
must
be
placed
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
as
a
result
an
essential
element
that
didn
t
exist
in
this
case
analyst
gerald
khoo
at
liberum
said
that
although
the
fine
itself
was
not
material
and
whistl
has
long
since
ended
its
attempts
at
competing
with
royal
mail
through
direct
delivery
there
were
broader
potential
implications
we
believe
this
is
a
reminder
that
royal
mail
must
act
with
restraint
given
its
dominant
market
shares
in
both
letters
and
parcels
and
this
limits
the
group
s
ability
to
grow
parcels
revenue
over
the
long
term
he
said
shares
in
royal
mail
were
trading
down
percent

pence
