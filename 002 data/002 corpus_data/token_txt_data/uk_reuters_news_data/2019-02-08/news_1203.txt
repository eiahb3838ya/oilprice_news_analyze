to
the

chancellor
angela
merkel
s
spokesman
said
germany
would
not
tolerate
vigilante
justice
the
unrest
reflected
a
growing
schism
in
german
society
after
merkel
s
government
allowed
about
million
asylum
seekers
to
enter
the
country
in
triggering
a
shift
to
the
right
in
german
politics

a
thousand
leftist

massed
near

giant
statue
of
karl
marx
in
chemnitz
on
monday
evening
to
protest
attacks
on
foreigners
that
occurred
during
an
impromptu
demonstration
on
sunday
after
reports
spread
on
social
media
about
the
stabbing
of
a
german
man
the
scenes
of
people
going
after
those
who
look
like
foreigners
scare
us
we
want
to
show
that
chemnitz
has
another
side
that
is
cosmopolitan
and
opposes
xenophobia
tim
detzner
the
head
of
the
radical
left
party
in
chemnitz
told
the
rally
nearly
the
same
number
of
demonstrators
waving
german
and
bavarian
flags
gathered
nearby
some
breaking
through
police
barriers
aimed
at
keeping
the
two
sides
apart
many
chanted
we
are
the
people
a
slogan
used
by
supporters
the
police
in
saxony
the
eastern
state
where
chemnitz
lies
said
on
twitter
at
around
gmt
that
the
demonstration
had
ended
and
they
were
accompanying
participants
to
the
train
station
tensions
were
running
high
after
some
demonstrators
including
about
that
police
described
as
ready
to
commit
violence
had
taken
to
the
streets
on
sunday
after
the
stabbing
which
police
said
occurred
after
a
row
local
prosecutors
said
they
had
arrested
two
suspects
a
syrian
man
and
a
iraqi
man

news
channels
broadcast

protest

said
they
were
still
investigating
reports
of
injury
filed
by
syrian
afghan
and
bulgarian
people
and
at
least
four
demonstrators
had
been
charged
we
don
t
tolerate
such
unlawful
assemblies
and
the
hounding
of
people
who
look
different
or
have
different
origins
and
attempts
to
spread
hatred
on
the
streets
merkel
s
spokesman
steffen
seibert
told
a
regular
news
briefing
that
has
no
place
in
our
cities
and
we
as
the
german
government
condemn
it
in
the
strongest
terms
he
said
our
basic
message
for
chemnitz
and
beyond
is
that
there
is
no
place
in
germany
for
vigilante
justice
for
groups
that
want
to
spread
hatred
on
the
streets
for
intolerance
and
for
roland
woeller
interior
minister
of
the
state
of
saxony
which
includes
chemnitz
said
authorities
would
not
allow
anarchists
to
run
rampant
he
warned
against
misinformation
and
lies
circulating
in
social
media
the
arrival
of
huge
numbers
of
migrants
from
the
middle
east
three
years
ago
has
fuelled
support
for
groups
such
as
pegida
and
the
alternative
for
germany
afd
now
the
main
opposition
party
in
parliament
tweeting
about
sunday
s
incident
afd
politician
markus
frohnmaier
said
if
the
state
is
no
longer
to
protect
citizens
then
people
take
to
the
streets
and
protect
themselves
it
s
as
simple
as
that
martina
renner
a
left
party
lawmaker
accused
the
of
trying
to
exploit
a
murder
for
its
own
political
ends
a
terrible
murder
the
background
to
which
is
still
unclear
is
being
instrumentalised
in
the
most
repugnant
way
for
racist
riots
in
chemnitz
she
tweeted
the
violence
in
chemnitz
is
likely
to
put
further
pressure
on
merkel
s
conservatives
who
last
week
faced
accusations
of
ignoring
the
rise
of
groups
in
saxony
