brexit - where will the uk end up: fudge, no-deal exit or halting brexit?
london
reuters
with
just
weeks
until
the
united
kingdom
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
it
is
unclear
how
or
even
whether
the
divorce
will
take
place
the
crushing
defeat
of
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
deal
means
she
must
now
work
with
other
parties
in
parliament
on
a
new
variant
if
she
is
to
avoid
a
brexit
or
the
other
option
a
referendum
on
membership
as
the
clock
ticks
down
to
gmt
on
march
the
time
and
date
set
in
law
for
brexit
may
has
three
main
options
a
compromise
deal
a
brexit
or
halting
brexit
altogether
after
her
defeat
may
pledged
to
speak
to
senior
to
parliamentarians
to
find
a
compromise
and
financial
markets
are
betting
that
lawmakers
will
cobble
together
a
deal
the
opposition
labour
party
s
finance
policy
spokesman
john
mcdonnell
said
labour
would
support
may
if
she
agreed
to
stay
in
a
permanent
customs
union
with
the
eu
a
close
relationship
with
its
single
market
and
greater
protections
for
workers
and
consumers
with
may
s
conservatives
deeply
split
the
opposition
party
holds
great
influence
over
the
eventual
outcome
of
brexit
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
any
brexit
plan
can
pass
the
house
of
commons
without
the
support
of
some
of
labour
s
lawmakers
but
if
may
moves
closer
to
labour
s
position
she
risks
losing
the
support
of
dozens
of
conservative
lawmakers
as
well
as
the
small
northern
irish
party
which
props
up
her
minority
government
if
may
is
unable
to
forge
a
compromise
deal
she
will
have
to
chose
between
calling
a
national
election
delaying
brexit
or
going
for
a
exit
many
conservative
lawmakers
would
oppose
fighting
a
national
election
at
such
a
crucial
juncture
especially
after
she
lost
the
party
its
majority
in
a
snap
poll
in
may
herself
said
on
wednesday
an
election
would
be
the
worst
thing
we
could
do
eu
chief
negotiator
michel
barnier
indicated
that
one
way
forward
would
be
for
britain
to
accept
closer
alignment
with
eu
regulations
eu
officials
say
london
could
for
example
abandon
its
plan
to
leave
the
eu
customs
union
and
single
market
but
that
is
unlikely
to
win
backing
among
many
conservatives
brexit
despite
strong
opposition
among
a
majority
of
british
lawmakers
and
many
businesses
to
leaving
the
eu
without
a
deal
this
remains
the
default
option
unless
parliament
can
agree
on
a
brexit
plan
it
is
not
enough
to
just
not
like
may
s
deal
to
not
have
a
there
has
to
be
something
to
replace
it
with
otherwise
we
leave
without
a
deal
said
one
senior
british
lawmaker
means
there
would
be
no
transition
so
the
exit
would
be
abrupt
the
nightmare
scenario
for
international
businesses
and
the
dream
of
hard
brexiteers
who
want
a
decisive
split
britain
is
a
member
of
the
world
trade
organization
so
tariffs
and
other
terms
governing
its
trade
with
the
eu
would
be
set
under
wto
rules
business
leaders
are
triggering
contingency
plans
to
cope
with
additional
checks
on
the
border
they
fear
will
clog
ports
silt
up
the
arteries
of
trade
and
dislocate
supply
chains
in
europe
and
beyond
brexit
supporters
say
there
would
be
disruption
but
in
the
the
uk
would
thrive
if
cut
free
from
what
they
cast
as
a
doomed
experiment
in
unity
that
is
falling
behind
china
and
the
united
states
since
the
referendum
opponents
of
brexit
have
sought
another
vote
they
hope
would
overturn
the
result
but
may
has
repeatedly
ruled
this
out
saying
it
would
undermine
faith
in
democracy
among
the
million
who
voted
in
to
leave
a
new
referendum
can
only
be
called
if
it
is
approved
by
parliament
and
there
is
currently
no
majority
in
favour
of
one
the
opposition
labour
party
wants
to
push
for
an
election
and
only
if
that
is
rejected
will
it
consider
another
referendum
labour
leader
jeremy
corbyn
is
a
veteran
eurosceptic
who
has
also
spoken
out
in
the
past
against
a
second
referendum
however
a
prominent
conservative
lawmaker
dominic
grieve
on
wednesday
submitted
legislation
making
provisions
for
a
second
brexit
referendum
if
parliament
agreed
to
a
second
referendum
britain
would
have
to
ask
for
an
extension
to
its
timetable
for
leaving
the
eu
to
allow
enough
time
for
a
campaign
probably
by
withdrawing
its
article
formal
departure
notification
the
electoral
commission
would
have
to
agree
what
question
or
questions
would
be
asked
of
the
public
at
the
highest
levels
of
government
there
are
worries
that
a
second
referendum
would
exacerbate
the
deep
divisions
exposed
by
the
referendum
alienate
millions
of
voters
and
stoke
support
for
the
if
britons
voted
to
remain
brexit
supporters
might
then
demand
a
third
and
decisive
vote
i
became
prime
minister
immediately
after
that
referendum
may
said
minutes
after
her
brexit
deal
was
rejected
on
tuesday
i
believe
it
is
my
duty
to
deliver
on
their
instruction
and
i
intend
to
