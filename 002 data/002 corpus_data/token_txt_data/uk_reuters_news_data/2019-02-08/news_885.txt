nations
reuters
nikki
haley
a
rising
republican
star
said
on
tuesday
she
was
stepping
down
as
ambassador
to
the
united
nations
but
knocked
down
speculation
that
she
might
challenge
president
donald
trump
at
the
next
election
sitting
beside
trump
in
the
oval
office
haley
said
her
stint
at
the
united
nations
had
been
an
honour
of
a
lifetime
and
that
she
would
stay
on
until
the
end
of
the
year
a
former
governor
of
south
carolina
and
the
daughter
of
indian
immigrants
haley
is
the
highest
profile
woman
in
trump
s
cabinet
and
has
often
been
seen
as
a
possible
presidential
candidate
haley
criticized
trump
during
the
election
campaign
but
has
been
the
face
of
his
america
first
policies
at
the
united
nations
steering
the
withdrawal
from
several
programs
and
ardently
defending
his
policies
against
iran
and
north
korea
over
their
nuclear
programs
haley
said
in
her
resignation
letter
to
trump
that
she
would
surely
not
be
a
candidate
for
any
office
in
and
would
instead
support
his
bid
she
referred
to
returning
to
the
private
sector
and
some
media
reports
said
she
had
debts
to
pay
off
but
haley
also
said
she
did
not
have
any
future
plans
set
and
her
decision
surprised
many
at
the
white
house
and
the
united
nations
speaking
to
reporters
later
on
tuesday
aboard
air
force
one
trump
said
he
had
five
people
on
his
short
list
for
envoy
including
former
white
house
adviser
dina
powell
a
friend
of
haley
s
trump
said
ambassador
to
germany
richard
grenell
was
not
on
the
short
list
but
that
he
was
willing
to
consider
him
trump
s
eldest
daughter
ivanka
trump
who
is
a
senior
adviser
to
her
father
ruled
herself
out
of
consideration
in
a
twitter
post
he
had
said
she
would
be
incredible
in
the
role
and
acknowledged
he
would
be
accused
of
nepotism
if
he
nominated
her
trump
said
haley
had
told
him
six
months
ago
that
she
was
thinking
of
leaving
by
the
end
the
year
to
take
a
little
time
he
was
effusive
in
his
praise
of
her
she
has
done
an
incredible
job
she
is
a
fantastic
person
very
importantly
but
she
also
is
somebody
that
gets
it
trump
said
on
tuesday
she
s
done
a
fantastic
job
and
we
ve
done
a
fantastic
job
haley
s
name
has
come
up
as
possible
republican
running
mate
in
the
last
two
presidential
elections
and
she
could
also
become
a
senator
if
fellow
south
carolina
republican
lindsey
graham
takes
up
a
job
in
the
trump
administration
as
is
often
speculated
trump
suggested
the
two
of
them
jointly
announce
haley
s
departure
in
the
oval
office
an
administration
official
said
noting
that
haley
was
the
only
outgoing
senior
member
of
trump
s
administration
to
be
feted
in
this
way
returning
the
favour
haley
praised
trump
and
his
family
for
their
support
she
described
jared
kushner
trump
s
and
aide
as
such
a
hidden
genius
that
no
one
understands
for
his
work
on
renegotiating
the
nafta
trade
deal
and
preparing
a
middle
east
peace
plan
that
has
not
yet
been
released
the
nature
of
her
resignation
was
markedly
different
from
other
departures
from
trump
s
cabinet
trump
unceremoniously
announced
his
firing
of
former
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
in
march
in
a
tweet
haley
was
seen
by
her
counterparts
at
the
united
nations
as
a
voice
of
clarity
in
a
administration
that
often
gave
off
mixed
signals
on
foreign
policy
diplomats
say
nikki
haley
is
one
of
the
most
talented
most
authentic
government
officials
that
i
have
ever
met
said
ambassador
for
france
francois
delattre
but
she
has
been
overshadowed
in
recent
months
by
the
appointments
of
trump
loyalist
mike
pompeo
as
secretary
of
state
and
hawk
john
bolton
as
white
house
national
security
adviser
pompeo
has
led
policy
on
talks
with
north
korea
while
bolton
has
taken
the
lead
on
trying
to
implement
trump
s
hard
line
against
iran
a
convert
to
christianity
in
her
after
being
raised
a
sikh
haley
is
popular
with
religious
conservatives
in
the
south
her
status
as
a
potential
candidate
for
national
high
office
was
boosted
in
when
she
ordered
the
confederate
battle
flag
to
be
pulled
down
at
south
carolina
s
state
capitol
grounds
after
a
white
supremacist
gunman
shot
dead
nine
black
worshipers
at
a
church
in
charleston
haley
has
also
applauded
women
who
come
forward
to
denounce
sexual
abuse
or
misconduct
by
men
and
said
they
should
be
heard
even
if
they
are
accusing
trump
women
who
accuse
anyone
should
be
heard
haley
said
last
december
after
accusations
against
three
members
of
congress
they
should
be
heard
and
they
should
be
dealt
referring
to
women
whose
accusations
brought
down
powerful
men
like
movie
producer
harvey
weinstein
haley
said
i
m
proud
of
their
strength
i
m
proud
of
their
haley
has
long
taken
a
tougher
public
stance
on
russia
than
trump
who
has
sought
better
relations
with
president
vladimir
putin
haley
raised
eyebrows
within
the
administration
when
she
announced
in
april
that
washington
was
going
to
impose
sanctions
on
moscow
over
its
support
of
syria
s
government
trump
then
decided
not
to
go
ahead
with
the
move
haley
fought
against
what
she
called
bias
at
the
united
nations
and
sometimes
seemed
to
be
channelling
trump
s
abrasive
style
of
diplomacy
last
year
she
upset
allies
and
foes
alike
by
warning
that
the
united
states
would
be
taking
names
of
countries
that
backed
a
resolution
criticizing
trump
s
decision
to
recognise
jerusalem
as
israel
s
capital
echoing
previous
statements
from
trump
haley
said
on
tuesday
that
the
united
states
under
his
presidency
is
now
respected
around
the
world
now
the
united
states
is
respected
countries
may
not
like
what
we
do
but
they
respect
what
we
do
they
know
that
if
we
say
we
re
going
to
do
something
we
follow
it
through
