reuters
jpmorgan
chase
co
and
bank
of
america
corp
have
placed
the
jobs
of
chairman
and
chief
executive
in
the
hands
of
one
person
and
now
no
citigroup
inc
must
decide
whether
to
follow
suit
the
matter
will
be
resolved
in
the
next
few
months
as
the
current
chairman
mike
o
neill
reaches
the
company
s
retirement
age
for
directors
citigroup
ceo
mike
corbat
will
soon
know
if
he
will
be
taking
on
the
additional
duties
of
chairman
or
working
for
a
new
boss
the
change
in
the
chairman
is
the
biggest
corporate
governance
decision
at
citigroup
in
six
years
said
analyst
mike
mayo
of
wells
fargo
that
s
important
given
what
we
see
as
returns
efficiency
and
stock
market
citigroup
the
bank
by
assets
reports
results
on
friday
investors
will
be
watching
its
progress
toward
cost
efficiency
and
return
on
equity
targets
as
well
as
revenue
from
its
big
credit
card
business
six
years
ago
o
neill
became
chairman
and
shortly
after
he
led
the
board
to
replace
vikram
pandit
with
corbat
o
neill
said
corbat
had
impressed
him
with
his
handling
of
some
billion
of
citigroup
assets
damaged
in
the
financial
crisis
since
then
corbat
has
kept
citigroup
on
a
path
of
improving
profits
and
returning
billions
of
dollars
of
excess
capital
to
investors
but
the
recovery
has
been
slow
and
has
fallen
short
of
the
company
s
goals
as
well
as
the
performance
of
competitors
citi
needs
a
greater
sense
of
urgency
to
improve
mayo
said
under
corbat
citigroup
shares
have
nearly
doubled
but
their
percent
gain
as
of
wednesday
pales
compared
with
the
percent
jump
for
jpmorgan
and
the
percent
gain
for
bank
of
america
the
biggest
and
banks
citigroup
stock
has
lagged
the
past
year
but
probably
not
enough
for
citigroup
directors
to
feel
pressed
to
make
big
changes
when
o
neill
leaves
said
analyst
brian
kleinhanzl
of
keefe
bruyette
woods
you
need
something
like
for
the
stock
to
be
down
percent
he
said
that
s
not
what
is
going
on
in
the
second
quarter
citigroup
s
return
on
tangible
common
equity
was
percent
compared
with
bank
of
america
s
percent
and
jpmorgan
s
percent
kleinhanzl
said
citigroup
stock
is
weak
partly
because
investors
doubt
citigroup
can
reach
its
target
for
return
on
tangible
common
equity
which
rises
to
percent
in
getting
there
kleinhanzl
said
is
going
to
be
a
citigroup
declined
to
comment
on
the
selection
of
the
next
chairman
in
a
statement
it
said
it
was
successfully
executing
its
financial
plan
and
had
updated
and
in
one
case

o
neill
has
publicly
addressed
the
question
of
his
successor
at
annual
shareholder
meetings
at
the
april
meeting
he
said
corbat
might
become
chairman
and
that
he
was
a
bit
agonistic
on
whether
the
jobs
of
ceo
and
chairman
should
be
kept
separate
one
year
earlier
o
neill
said
the
board
believed
that
an
independent
chairman
is
a
good
other
banks
have
faced
shareholder
votes
on
the
issue
bank
of
america
took
the
chairmanship
title
away
from
ceo
ken
lewis
in
following
a
shareholder
vote
on
the
issue
only
to
give
the
job
to
ceo
brian
moynihan
five
years
later
since
then
the
board
has
faced
three
shareholder
votes
on
the
question
and
prevailed
in
each
in
jpmorgan
directors
beat
back
a
shareholder
proposal
seen
as
calling
for
ceo
jamie
dimon
to
give
up
his
chairmanship
after
a
billion
trading
loss
mayo
said
some
of
citigroup
s
largest
shareholders
have
told
him
that
they
want
the
board
to
keep
the
chairman
and
chief
executive
roles
separate
they
would
be
reassured
having
an
extra
set
of
eyes
representing
their
interests
he
said
studies
are
inconclusive
on
whether
companies
perform
better
with
different
people
in
the
two
posts
said
abby
adlerman
founder
of
consulting
firm
boardspan
adlerman
said
she
used
to
advocate
separating
the
two
posts
but
has
come
to
realize
that
titles
suggesting
independence
and
objectivity
are
not
as
important
as
personalities
and
collaborative
relationships
between
directors
and
executives
the
best
ceos
whether
they
are
currently
a
chair
or
aspire
to
be
a
chair
realize
the
value
of
independent
boards
