uk watchdog intervenes to release mortgage 'prisoners'
london
reuters
tens
of
thousands
of
mortgage
prisoners
in
britain
could
be
freed
after
the
financial
regulator
said
on
thursday
it
would
ease
affordability
checks
required
by
home
loan
providers
when
remortgaging
to
a
cheaper
deal
the
prisoners
took
out
loans
before
tougher
rules
introduced
since
the
financial
crisis
left
them
unable
to
meet
stricter
mortgage
affordability
tests
even
if
they
have
an
unblemished
record
of
repayments
interest
rates
in
britain
have
begun
to
rise
making
it
more
pressing
to
help
those
customers
locked
into
mortgages
with
a
high
rate
of
interest
unable
to
shop
around
for
cheaper
deals
they
include
customers
at
authorised
lenders
with
firms
that
are
no
longer
actively
offering
loans
and
with
loans
from
firms
not
regulated
by
the
uk
s
financial
conduct
authority
fca
banks
at
uk
finance
a
trade
body
came
to
a
voluntary
arrangement
earlier
this
year
to
allow
some
customers
of
authorised
lenders
to
remortgage
if
they
met
basic
conditions
but
lenders
have
said
that
changes
were
needed
to
help
people
who
want
to
move
home
loans
from
an
unregulated
firm
to
avoid
being
in
breach
of
current
regulations
fca
chief
executive
andrew
bailey
said
the
watchdog
will
publish
a
consultation
paper
in
the
spring
to
help
these
customers
we
will
consult
on
changes
to
our
responsible
lending
rules
with
the
aim
to
deliver
a
more
proportionate
affordability
assessment
bailey
said
in
a
letter
to
parliament
s
treasury
select
committee
that
was
published
on
thursday
jackie
bennett
director
of
mortgages
at
uk
finance
said
they
would
continue
to
work
with
their
members
and
the
fca
to
help
customers
who
want
a
mortgage
to
switch
lenders
more
easily
bailey
said
the
new
test
would
be
whether
the
new
mortgage
costs
are
more
affordable
than
the
current
costs
and
would
focus
on
people
who
want
a
cheaper
deal
and
are
not
increasing
the
amount
borrowed
there
also
needs
to
be
a
willingness
from
industry
to
offer
opportunities
to
these
customers
once
the
regulatory
barriers
are
removed
he
added
over
the
coming
months
we
will
work
with
firms
and
trade
bodies
on
the
practicalities
