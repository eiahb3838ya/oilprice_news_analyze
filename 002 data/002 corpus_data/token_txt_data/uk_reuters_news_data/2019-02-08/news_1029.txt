kavanaugh accuser wants fbi investigation before she will testify
washington
reuters
a
woman
who
has
accused
president
donald
trump
s
supreme
court
nominee
brett
kavanaugh
of
sexual
assault
decades
ago
wants
her
allegations
to
be
investigated
by
the
fbi
before
she
appears
at
a
senate
hearing
her
lawyers
said
on
tuesday
the
development
further
roiled
a
confirmation
process
that
once
seemed
smooth
for
kavanaugh
whose
confirmation
to
the
lifetime
post
could
consolidate
the
conservative
grip
on
the
top
court
christine
blasey
ford
a
university
professor
in
california
has
accused
kavanaugh
of
attacking
her
and
trying
to
remove
her
clothing
while
he
was
drunk
at
a
suburban
maryland
party
in
when
they
were
both
high
school
students
allegations
kavanaugh
has
called
completely
the
senate
judiciary
committee
which
is
overseeing
the
nomination
had
called
a
hearing
for
monday
to
examine
the
matter
and
the
white
house
had
said
kavanaugh
was
ready
to
testify
in
a
letter
to
the
committee
s
chairman
republican
senator
chuck
grassley
ford
s
attorneys
said
an
fbi
investigation
needed
to
come
first
a
full
investigation
by
law
enforcement
officials
will
ensure
that
the
crucial
facts
and
witnesses
in
this
matter
are
assessed
in
a
manner
and
that
the
committee
is
fully
informed
before
conducting
any
hearing
or
making
any
decisions
the
lawyers
wrote
a
copy
of
the
letter
was
posted
on
the
committee
website
grassley
said
there
is
no
reason
to
delay
ford
s
testimony
and
an
invitation
for
her
to
appear
before
the
committee
on
monday
stands
dr
ford
s
testimony
would
reflect
her
personal
knowledge
and
memory
of
events
nothing
the
fbi
or
any
other
investigator
does
would
have
any
bearing
on
what
dr
ford
tells
the
committee
so
there
is
no
reason
for
any
further
delay
grassley
said
in
a
statement
democrats
already
fiercely
opposed
to
the
nominee
have
also
been
seeking
an
fbi
investigation
a
request
that
republicans
have
rebuffed
trump
and
other
republicans
said
they
did
not
think
the
fbi
needed
to
be
involved
a
hearing
would
represent
a
potential
moment
for
the
conservative
federal
appeals
court
judge
s
confirmation
chances
as
trump
pursues
his
goal
of
moving
the
federal
judiciary
to
the
right
the
supreme
court
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
i
got
elected
president
i
hope
republican
voters
and
others
are
watching
and
studying
the
democrats
playbook
trump
tweeted
late
on
tuesday
republicans
control
the
senate
by
only
a
narrow
margin
meaning
any
defections
within
the
party
could
sink
the
nomination
and
deal
a
major
setback
to
trump
earlier
on
tuesday
senator
lindsey
graham
one
of
the
committee
s
republicans
said
the
panel
would
vote
on
the
nomination
next
week
whether
or
not
ford
testified
a
vote
in
committee
would
be
a
precursor
to
action
in
the
full
senate
if
she
does
not
want
to
come
monday
publicly
or
privately
we
re
going
to
move
on
and
vote
wednesday
he
told
fox
news
channel
in
a
statement
on
monday
a
representative
for
the
justice
department
said
the
fbi
had
followed
protocol
forwarding
information
about
the
allegation
to
the
white
house
the
fbi
s
role
in
such
matters
is
to
provide
information
for
the
use
of
the
decision
makers
the
statement
said
trump
earlier
on
tuesday
stepped
up
his
defence
of
kavanaugh
and
expressed
sympathy
towards
his
nominee
who
met
with
officials
at
the
white
house
for
a
second
straight
day
although
not
with
the
president
i
feel
so
badly
for
him
that
he
s
going
through
this
to
be
honest
with
you
trump
told
a
news
conference
this
is
not
a
man
that
deserves
hopefully
the
woman
will
come
forward
state
her
case
he
will
state
his
case
before
representatives
of
the
united
states
senate
and
then
they
will
vote
trump
added
senator
john
cornyn
a
member
of
the
senate
republican
leadership
appeared
to
cast
doubt
on
ford
s
allegations
we
just
don
t
know
what
happened
years
ago
and
there
are
gaps
in
her
memory
she
doesn
t
know
how
she
got
there
when
it
was
and
so
that
would
logically
be
something
where
she
would
get
questions
cornyn
told
reporters
cornyn
s
fellow
republicans
have
generally
avoided
criticizing
ford
instead
castigating
democrats
for
not
revealing
her
allegations
earlier
the
confirmation
fight
comes
just
weeks
before
the
congressional
elections
in
which
democrats
are
seeking
to
take
control
of
congress
from
trump
s
fellow
republicans
which
would
be
a
major
blow
to
the
president
s
agenda
ford
detailed
her
allegation
in
a
letter
sent
in
july
to
senator
dianne
feinstein
the
committee
s
top
democrat
the
letter
s
contents
leaked
last
week
and
ford
identified
herself
in
an
interview
with
the
washington
post
published
on
sunday
that
included
details
about
the
alleged
assault
in
a
statement
feinstein
said
the
committee
should
accede
to
ford
s
wishes
and
postpone
monday
s
hearing
a
proper
investigation
must
be
completed
witnesses
interviewed
evidence
reviewed
and
all
sides
spoken
to
only
then
should
the
chairman
set
a
hearing
date
she
said
in
a
statement
lisa
banks
an
attorney
for
ford
told
cnn
her
client
was
dealing
with
hate
mail
harassment
death
threats
and
that
her
immediate
focus
was
protecting
herself
and
her
family
democrats
have
objected
to
the
proposed
hearing
format
with
feinstein
arguing
there
should
be
more
than
just
two
witnesses
possibly
to
include
people
in
whom
ford
previously
confided
the
committee
s
democrats
said
witnesses
should
include
kavanaugh
s
friend
mark
judge
who
ford
has
said
witnessed
the
alleged
incident
a
lawyer
representing
judge
sent
a
letter
to
grassley
saying
judge
did
not
want
to
speak
publicly
about
the
matter
in
fact
i
have
no
memory
of
this
alleged
incident
brett
kavanaugh
and
i
were
friends
in
high
school
but
i
do
not
recall
the
party
described
in
dr
ford
s
letter
more
to
the
point
i
never
saw
brett
act
in
the
manner
dr
ford
describes
the
letter
quoted
judge
as
saying
judge
is
the
author
of
a
memoir
titled
wasted
tales
of
a
gen
x
drunk
which
recounts
his
experiences
as
a
teenage
alcoholic
one
democratic
senator
richard
blumenthal
said
kavanaugh
should
withdraw
his
nomination
i
believe
dr
ford
i
believe
the
survivor
here
blumenthal
said
she
has
come
forward
courageously
and
bravely
knowing
she
would
face
a
nightmare
of
possible
and
vicious
the
showdown
has
echoes
of
current
supreme
court
justice
clarence
thomas
contentious
confirmation
hearings
in
involving
sexual
harassment
allegations
lodged
against
him
by
a
law
professor
named
anita
hill
thomas
the
court
s
second
black
justice
was
ultimately
confirmed
but
only
after
a
nasty
televised
hearing
in
which
hill
faced
pointed
questions
from
republican
senators
and
the
nominee
said
he
was
the
victim
of
a
lynching
