wanzhou
a
top
executive
at

s
huawei
technologies
co
ltd
and
daughter
of
the
founder
and
ceo
jolted
the
global
business
community
on
thursday
and
raised
fears
that
a
truce
in
the
trade
war
could
come
to
a
swift
end
meng
s
arrest
came
at
the
behest
of
authorities
and
is
connected
to
an
investigation
into
alleged
violations
of
trade
sanctions
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
china
s
foreign
ministry
said
neither
the
united
states
nor
canada
have
explained
reasons
for
the
arrest
what
is
huawei
huawei
is
the
world
s
largest
supplier
of
telecommunications
network
equipment
and
maker
of
smartphones
with
revenue
of
about
billion
billion
pounds
last
year
unlike
other
big
chinese
technology
firms
it
does
much
of
its
business
overseas
and
is
a
market
leader
in
many
countries
across
europe
asia
and
africa
the
company
was
founded
in
by
former
military
officer
ren
zhengfei
it
remains
privately
held
and
describes
itself
as
though
its
ownership
structure
is
unknown
it
is
based
in
the
southern
chinese
tech
hub
of
shenzhen
and
employs
about
people
how
did
the
company
become
so
successful
huawei
was
a
pioneering
supplier
of
telecom
gear
at
a
time
when
china
was
spending
heavily
to
upgrade
its
networks
importing
much
of
its
equipment
huawei
began
competing
internationally
in
the
and
was
known
for
drastically
undercutting
rivals
on
price
competitors
branded
huawei
a
vendor
of
copycat
equipment
and
companies
including
cisco
systems
and
motorola
filed
lawsuits
over
alleged
trade
secret
theft
but
huawei
spent
heavily
on
research
and
development
and
is
now
regarded
as
a
global
leader
in
key
telecom
network
technologies
and
smartphones
in
contrast
its
major
western
rivals
nokia
and
ericsson
have
struggled
financially
in
recent
years
huawei
today
continues
to
expand
into
new
areas
including
chip
development
artificial
intelligence
and
cloud
computing
why
have
some
governments
banned
huawei
equipment
intelligence
agencies
allege
that
huawei
is
linked
to
china
s
government
and
that
its
equipment
could
contain
backdoors
for
use
by
government
spies
no
evidence
has
been
produced
publicly
and
the
firm
has
repeatedly
denied
the
claims
but
suspicions
persist
concern
now
centres
on
the
deployment
of
mobile
networks
where
huawei
is
at
the
cutting
edge
a
new
law
in
china
requiring
any
domestic
firm
to
assist
the
government
when
asked
has
also
stoked
concern
the
government
has
taken
a
series
of
steps
to
block
the
firm
from
markets
including
banning
government
purchases
of
huawei
gear
and
denying
government
help
to
any
carrier
that
uses
huawei
equipment
top
carriers
verizon
communications
and
at
t
pulled
out
of
deals
to
distribute
huawei
smartphones
earlier
this
year
most
countries
even
close
allies
such
as
canada
britain
and
germany
have
not
made
any
moves
against
huawei
arguing
they
have
sufficient
procedures
to
test
equipment
for
security
but
australia
and
new
zealand
recently
banned
huawei
from
building
networks
and
there
are
indications
that
other
countries
including
germany
are
revisiting
the
issue
is
the
arrest
of
meng
wanzhou
related
to
these
security
concerns
authorities
have
not
disclosed
circumstances
surrounding
meng
arrest
but
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
the
arrest
relates
to
violations
of
trade
sanctions
reuters
published
an
investigation
almost
six
years
ago
about
her
and
huawei
ties
to
a
company
call
skycom
that
tried
to
sell
computer
equipment
to
an
iranian
operator
in
contravention
of
those
sanctions
wasn
t
another
chinese
company
also
accused
of
iran
sanctions
violations
huawei
s
smaller
rival
zte
corp
pleaded
guilty
last
year
to
conspiring
to
evade
embargoes
by
selling
equipment
to
iran
earlier
this
year
the
commerce
department
said
zte
violated
the
settlement
and
barred
it
from
buying
any
components
a
move
that
all
but
halted
many
zte
operations
a
new
settlement
was
reached
and
the
ban
lifted
at
the
behest
of
president
donald
trump
a
perceived
concession
to
chinese
president
xi
jinping
that
surprised
and
angered
others
in
the
government
are
these
issues
related
to
the
trade
war
the
sanctions
investigations
long
preceded
the
trade
war
but
the
timing
of
the
arrest
tangles
the
issues
as
it
came
just
as
presidents
trump
and
xi
reached
a
temporary
trade
war
truce
financial
markets
turned
negative
on
news
of
the
arrest
on
fears
it
could
scupper
the
truce
however
there
is
no
evidence
of
it
being
a
deliberate
provocation
by
the
rather
than
just
an
awkward
coincidence
what
might
happen
to
huawei
now
a
ban
on
component
purchases
such
as
the
one
temporarily
imposed
on
zte
would
be
devastating
but
there
is
no
immediate
reason
to
suggest
that
will
happen
if
the
case
prompts
major
european
countries
in
particular
to
turn
against
the
firm
that
would
have
a
impact
on
its
growth
and
influence
still
huawei
s
status
as
a
kingpin
of
china
s
industry
at
a
time
when
the
country
is
racing
to
catch
up
with
the
in
difficult
areas
such
as
chip
development
means
it
will
almost
certainly
remain
a
powerful
force
for
years
to
come
