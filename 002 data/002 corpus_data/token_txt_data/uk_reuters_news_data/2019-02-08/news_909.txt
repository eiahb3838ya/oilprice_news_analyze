clutching
her

chest
hidayat
was
not
on
sulawesi
last
friday
when
the
magnitude
earthquake
struck
triggering
a
phenomenon
called
soil
liquefaction
which
turns
the
ground
into
a
roiling
quagmire
the
neighbourhood
of
petobo
in
the
south
of
the

of
palu

prayers
at
a

in
the
centre
of

km
miles
northeast

indonesia
s
capital
jakarta
worshippers
knelt
to
pray
on
red
carpets
put
down
outside
the
mosque
as
the
building
is
unsafe
due
to
quake
damage
indonesia
has
the
world
s
biggest
muslim
population
but
also
pockets
of
christians
including
on
sulawesi
and
other
religions
the
official
death
toll
from
the
quake
and
the
tsunami
it
triggered
stands
at
but
it
will
certainly
rise
most
of
the
dead
have
been
found
in
palu
figures
for
more
remote
areas
some
still
cut
off
by
destroyed
roads
and
landslides
are
only
trickling
in
if
at
all
no
one
knows
how
many
people
were
dragged
to
their
deaths
when
the
ground
under
petobo
and
nearby
areas
south
of
palu
dissolved
so
violently
the
national
disaster
agency
says
homes
in
one
neighbourhood
alone
were
swallowed
up
and
hundreds
of
people
killed

of
my
children

my
sister
my
brother
in

and
their
children
all
homes
were
sucked
into
the
earth
torn
apart
and
shunted
hundreds
of
metres
by
the
churning
mud
the
earth
was
like
a
blender
blending
everything
in
its
way
said
hasnah
who
like
many
indonesians
goes
by
only
one
name
hasnah
said
she
has
enough
food
and
water

area
only
began
on
thursday

said
they
would
come
with
the
heavy
machines

no
one
here

dig
them
