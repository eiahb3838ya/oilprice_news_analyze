washington
reuters
the
economy
grew
at
its
fastest
pace
in
nearly
four
years
in
the
second
quarter
as
consumers
boosted
spending
and
farmers
rushed
shipments
of
soybeans
to
china
to
beat
retaliatory
trade
tariffs
before
they
took
effect
in
early
july
president
donald
trump
who
ahead
of
friday
s
release
of
the
gross
domestic
product
report
had
promoted
the
notion
that
growth
would
be
robust
declared
victory
we
have
accomplished
an
economic
turnaround
of
historic
proportions
trump
told
reporters
these
numbers
are
very
very
gross
domestic
product
increased
at
a
percent
annualised
rate
also
as
government
spending
picked
up
the
commerce
department
said
in
its
snapshot
of
gdp
while
that
was
the
strongest
performance
since
the
third
quarter
of
it
was
not
the
best
since
the
recession
ended
in
quarter
gdp
growth
was
revised
up
to
a
percent
pace
from
the
previously
reported
percent
rate
to
account
for
updated
information
and
methodology
improvements
compared
to
the
second

in
the
first
half
of
putting
the
economy
on
track
to
hit
the
trump
administration
s
target
of
percent
annual
growth
a
measure
of
domestic
demand
surged
at
a
percent
rate
in
the
second
quarter
contrary
to
trump
s
assertions
the
economy
enjoyed
periods
of
robust
growth
during
the
obama
administration
gdp
growth
recorded
a
percent
pace
in
the
second
quarter
of
and
the
economy
experienced
four
quarters
of
output
above
a
percent
rate
economists
also
cautioned
against
putting
much
weight
on
the
surge
in
growth
as
factors
including
a
trillion
tax
cut
package
were
behind
the
growth
spurt
the
soybean
boost
is
likely
to
reverse
in
the
coming
quarters
and
the
fiscal
stimulus
is
seen
fading
in
pop
the
champagne
today
but
don
t
get
used
to
it
growth
going
forward
has
a
lot
of
headwinds
said
chris
rupkey
chief
economist
at
mufg
in
new
york
unless
you
cut
taxes
again
there
won
t
be
additional

monies
to

company
and
consumer
pocket
the
united
states
slapped
percent
duties
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
effective
july
provoking
a
similar
response
from
beijing
which
targeted
soybeans
and
other
agricultural
products
as
well
as
cars
trump
has
also
imposed
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
imports
leading
to
retaliation
by
the
united
states
main
trade
partners
including
canada
the
european

mexico
and
china
strong
growth

the

more
times

economists
in

earlier
this

slow

said
joel

that
said
there
is
every
reason
to
expect
that
