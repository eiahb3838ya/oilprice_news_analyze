that
evidence
pointed
to
a
brutal
crime
planned
and
perpetrated
by
saudi
officials
khashoggi
s
killing
by
a
team
of
saudi
operatives
on
provoked
widespread
revulsion
and
tarnished
the
image
of
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
previously
admired
in
the
west
for
pushing
deep
changes
including
tax
reform
infrastructure
projects
and
allowing
women

still
publicly
unknown
riyadh
denies
the
prince
had
any
involvement
in
the
murder
evidence
collected
during
my
mission
to
turkey
shows
prime
facie
case
that
khashoggi
was
the
victim
of
a
brutal
and
premeditated
killing
planned
and
perpetrated
by
officials
of
the
state
of
saudi
arabia
agnes
callamard
special
rapporteur
for
extrajudicial
summary
or
arbitrary
executions
said
in
statement
issued
in
geneva
she
said
her
jan
mission
to
turkey
with
a
team
of
three
experts
could
not
firmly
establish
whether
the
original
intention
was
to
abduct
khashoggi
with
his
murder
planned
only
in
the
eventuality
of
this
abduction
saudi
officials
had
seriously
undermined
and
delayed
turkey
s
efforts
to
investigate
the
crime
scene
at
its
istanbul
consulate
where
khashoggi
had
gone
to
get
papers
needed
for
his
wedding
she
said
neither
the
saudi
government
communications
office
nor
turkey
s
foreign
ministry
gave
immediate
responses
to
requests
for
comment
on
the
report
of
the
crimes
scenes
delayed
access
to
the
consulate
and
residence
and
clean
up
of
the
crimes
scenes
had
severely
limited
the
potential
for
the
turkish
criminal
forensic
investigation
to
produce
telling
evidence
callamard
added
after
khashoggi
s
first
visit
to
the
consulate
on
sept
saudi
planning
included
the
travel
of
the
three
teams
that
carried
out
the
operation
the
presence
of
a
lookalike
of
mr
khashoggi
who
was
seen
leaving
the
consulate
the
presence
of
a
forensic
doctor
the
escape
of
the
teams
members
and
of
course
the
disposal
of
khashoggi
s
it
was
unconscionable
that
saudi
authorities
continued
to
fail
to
disclose
the
whereabouts
of
khashoggi
s
remains
after
having
admitted
that
he
met
his
death
within
their
custody
in
their
consular
premises
she
added
callamard
said
her
team
had
access
to
part
of
chilling
and
gruesome
audio
material
of
khashoggi
s
death
obtained
by
the
turkish
intelligence
agency
she
had
also
been
promised
access
to
forensic
and
police
reports
critical
to
her
inquiry
a
saudi
public
prosecutor
s
spokesman
said
late
last
year
that
saudis
had
been
indicted
and
referred
for

over
the

saudi
arabia
has
denied
turkey
s
request
for
extradition
of

suspects
amid
conflicting
claims
for

callamard
said
she
had
major
concerns
about
the
fairness
of
the
trial
proceedings
and
had
sought
an
official
visit
to
the
kingdom
callamard
