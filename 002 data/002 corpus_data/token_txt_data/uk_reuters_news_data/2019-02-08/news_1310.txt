independent labels urge eu to block sony's $2.3 billion bid for emi
brussels
reuters
independent
music
labels
group
impala
has
called
on
eu
antitrust
regulators
to
block
sony
corp
s
bid
to
become
the
world
s
largest
music
publisher
with
its
billion
offer
for
control
of
emi
saying
the
combination
would
have
too
much
market
power
sony
announced
the
deal
in
may
the
boldest
strategy
move
by
its
new
ceo
kenichiro
yoshida
which
would
give
it
rights
to
million
songs
from
artists
such
as
drake
sam
smith
pharrell
williams
and
sia
the
japanese
conglomerate
which
currently
owns
a
percent
stake
in
emi
wants
to
buy
mubalada
investment
co
s
percent
stake
last
month
it
acquired
the
estate
of
michael
jackson
s
minority
share
of
emi
the
growing
popularity
of
music
streaming
services
such
as
spotify
apple
music
google
play
soundcloud
and
youtube
has
boosted
the
industry
sony
s
control
of
emi
would
give
it
the
power
to
do
what
it
wants
said
helen
smith
impala
s
executive
chair
the
market
needs
big
operators
but
not
when
they
are
allowed
to
acquire
so
much
power
that
they
start
to
strangle
it
and
squeeze
out
the
independents
who
are
the
ones
taking
the
risks
she
said
adding
that
percent
of
new
releases
come
from
independent
labels
she
said
the
deal
would
give
sony
the
clout
to
negotiate
online
rights
for
both
its
recording
and
publishing
catalogs
promote
its
global
repertoire
both
on
radio
and
in
playlists
and
be
better
able
to
attract
songwriters
with
better
terms
there
was
also
a
risk
that
sony
might
focus
more
on
hits
rather
than
local
songs
smith
said
blocking
seems
to
be
the
only
outcome
as
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
remedies
could
help
in
this
case
she
said
impala
plans
to
submit
its
comments
to
the
european
commission
this
week
the
eu
competition
enforcer
cleared
sony
and
mubadala
s
acquisition
of
emi
s
music
publishing
business
in
in
return
for
hefty
concessions
including
the
sale
of
the
worldwide
publishing
rights
to
four
catalogs
and
the
musical
works
of
composers
