italy
reuters
britain
believes
an
orderly
agreed
exit
from
the
european
union
is
still
the
most
likely
outcome
but
time
is
running
out
and
a
deal
should
be
done
by
november
at
the
latest
cabinet
office
minister
david
lidington
said
on
saturday
speaking
on
the
sidelines
of
italy
s
annual
ambrosetti
conference
on
european
affairs
lidington
said
london
wanted
a
deal
that
satisfied
all
eu
member
states
but
its
contingency
plan
for
a
brexit
was
well
developed
we
remain
very
much
committed
to
getting
a
good
deal
and
believing
that
that
is
not
just
the
right
outcome
but
the
most
probable
outcome
he
told
reuters
in
an
interview
he
said
it
was
important
to
wrap
up
negotiations
by
november
in
order
to
give
british
and
european
parliaments
enough
time
to
review
and
approve
the
text
of
any
agreement
this
is
not
something
that
can
simply
be
left
to
the
hour
lidington
added
the
uk
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
on
march
yet
little
is
clear
if
the
world
s
fifth
largest
economy
leaves
the
eu
without
a
detailed
agreement
financial
markets
fear
a
chaotic
divorce
that
would
disrupt
trade
flows
across
europe
there
is
so
far
no
full
exit
deal
rivals
to
prime
minister
theresa
may
are
circling
and
some
mps
are
pushing
for
a
rerun
of
the
referendum
may
recently
outlined
proposals
on
economic
and
trade
policy
in
a
white
paper
which
lidington
said
would
ensure
frictionless
trade
especially
across
the
uk
s
only
land
border
with
the
eu
between
ireland
and
northern
ireland
but
eu
chief
brexit
negotiator
michel
barnier
has
criticised
the
proposals
saying
they
imply
britain
wants
a
kind
of
Ã 
la
carte
single
market
a
kind
of
cherrypicking
approach
