several

the
effect
of
trade
wars
just
as
automakers
pump
billions
into
greener
technologies
to
meet
stricter
emissions
rules
and
customers
shun
combustion
engines
in
the
face
of
higher
levies
demand
in
china
which
had
once
been
one
of
its
strongest
countries
but
has
since
been
hit
by
a
slowdown
fell
by
percent
the
biggest
drop
of
any
of
its
markets
the
economic
slowdown
in
china
along
with
ongoing
trade
tensions
is
continuing
to
influence
consumer
confidence

chief
commercial
officer
felix
brautigam
diesel
accounts
for
percent
of
the
firm
s
british

the

as

tumbles
following
new
levies
in
the
wake
of
the
volkswagen

the

s
chief
financial
officer
said
in
october
that
the
firm
s
changshu
plant
in
china
has
basically
been
closed
for
most
of
october
in
order
to
allow
the
inventory
of
both
our
vehicles
and
dealer
inventory
to
start
to
like
fellow
automakers
the
company
could
see
its
three
british
car
factories
grind
to
a
halt
in
fewer
than
days
if
mps
next
week
reject
a
deal
by
prime
minister
theresa
may
leading
to
tariffs
and
customs
checks
after
a
outcome
given
the
difficulties
that
they
re
going
through
to
add
further
costs
and
further
disruption
from
a
brexit
it
s
clear
why
they
ve
been
so
clear
that
this
would
be
against
their
interests
said
business
minister
greg
clark
car
brand
is
also
taking
steps
to
prepare
for
a
brexit
but
called
on
the
government
to
prevent
that
outcome
we
urge
the
government
to
avoid
any
hard
brexit
