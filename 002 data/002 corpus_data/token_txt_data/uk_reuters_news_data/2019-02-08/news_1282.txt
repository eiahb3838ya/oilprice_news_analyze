exclusive - amazon considering uk insurance comparison site: sources
london
reuters
inc
is
sounding
out
some
of
europe
s
top
insurance
firms
to
see
if
they
would
contribute
products
to
a
uk
price
comparison
website
in
what
would
be
a
major
foray
by
the
online
retail
giant
into
the
region
s
financial
services
three
industry
executives
told
reuters
they
had
held
talks
with
amazon
about
the
possible
launch
of
a
site
one
said
the
talks
were
part
of
several
discussions
amazon
is
having
with
insurers
a
second
said
there
were
no
imminent
launch
plans
while
it
was
not
immediately
clear
what
type
of
insurance
would
be
sold
on
any
amazon
site
home
and
motor
policies
are
popular
sellers
on
existing
uk
price
comparison
sites
as
amazon
becomes
a
larger
part
of
the
home
whether
it
s
products
delivered
to
the
home
security
monitoring
home
services
like
installation
you
can
make
the
case
that
insurance
is
the
next
logical
step
for
this
company
said
morningstar
analyst
hottovy
the
industry
sources
declined
to
be
named
as
the
talks
are
confidential
amazon
declined
to
comment
an
amazon
price
comparison
website
for
insurance
products
would
be
a
potential
challenge
to
existing
uk
sites
given
the
company
s
technology
reach
and
loyal
customer
base
two
of
the
most
high
profile
are
which
shows
products
from
insurers
including
axa
hastings
and
esure
and
gocompare
which
lists
insurance
from
firms
such
as
santander
and
in
response
to
the
prospect
of
amazon
launching
a
rival
service
shares
in
moneysupermarket
gocompare
and
admiral
which
runs
the
site
were
down
between
percent
and
percent
on
thursday
a
uk
insurance
site
would
also
build
on
amazon
s
existing
products
in
europe
offering
extensions
to
manufacturers
warranties
a
service
known
as
amazon
protect
while
amazon
s
loyal
customer
base
and
reach
would
probably
prove
attractive
to
some
insurers
happy
to
cede
some
of
their
premiums
to
amazon
to
expand
sales
the
potential
for
premiums
to
be
forced
lower
through
competition
could
deter
others
one
of
the
industry
sources
said
the
comparison
site
model
fitted
amazon
s
strategy
of
offering
a
range
of
products
as
opposed
to
partnering
with
one
firm
a
price
comparison
website
in
particular
could
also
be
used
to
help
drive
traffic
to
its
other
marketplaces
hottovy
said
it
was
not
immediately
clear
what
financial
arrangements
amazon
would
strike
with
insurers
if
it
were
to
go
ahead
google
launched
a
financial
services
comparison
site
in
the
united
kingdom
and
the
united
states
in
but
shut
it
down
after
only
a
year
due
to
low
traffic
in
the
united
states
amazon
has
a
joint
venture
with
insurer
berkshire
hathaway
and
jp
morgan
aimed
at
slashing
healthcare
costs
it
also
offers
a
small
business
loan
programme
in
europe
amazon
has
had
a
partnership
with
the
warranty
group
since
to
offer
the
warranty
extensions
it
also
offers
credit
cards
in
the
united
kingdom
and
germany
although
it
does
not
lend
money
of
its
own
in
a
sign
of
potential
expansion
plans
amazon
began
to
place
job
ads
last
year
for
staff
for
a
new
insurance
business
in
europe
without
giving
details
while
chinese
tech
giants
alibaba
and
tencent
have
large
finance
arms
leading
western
tech
firms
have
taken
a
more
cautious
approach
to
heavily
regulated
financial
services
which
often
have
hefty
capital
requirements
a
comparison
site
however
would
let
amazon
give
its
customers
access
to
insurance
from
a
variety
of
providers
while
avoiding
that
level
of
regulatory
burden
industry
sources
said
the
use
of
comparison
websites
to
buy
motor
and
home
insurance
is
more
prevalent
in
the
united
kingdom
than
europe
or
the
united
states
some
insurers
rely
heavily
on
comparison
websites
for
sales
uk
insurer
hastings
for
example
told
reuters
it
sells
percent
of
its
motor
policies
through
such
sites
rival
car
insurer
admiral
also
relies
on
websites
for
sales
and
would
be
open
to
joining
any
amazon
site
its
chief
financial
officer
geraint
jones
said
if
it
establishes
a
comparison
site
then
i
suspect
admiral
will
be
interested
in
being
a
member
potentially
price
comparison
is
the
main
source
of
distribution
of
our
products
and
we
ll
await
with
interest
what
they
do
