deputy
chief
of
indonesia
s
transportation
safety
committee
knkt
told
a
news
conference
the
extent
of
damage
to
the
device
showed
the
extraordinary
impact
of
the
crash
he
said
despite
initial
reports
authorities
did
not
know
for
certain
whether
the
crash
survivable
memory
unit
was
from
the
flight
data
recorder
or
cockpit
voice
recorder
as
portions
of
it
were
missing
satmiko
said
searchers
have
yet
to
detect
a
location
signal
from
the
second
of
the
two
black
boxes
housed
at
opposite
ends
of
the
aircraft
although
the
seafloor
is
only
about
metres
down
strong
currents
and
energy
pipelines
in
the
area
have
hampered
search
efforts
the
data
it
holds
should
provide
clues
to
what
went
wrong
the
plane
which
had
only
been
in
service
since
august
went
silent
minutes
after
taking
off
on
monday
from
jakarta

for
the
town
of
pangkal
pinang
the

had
already
received
permission
to
return
to
base
a
navy
diver
on
board
a
search
vessel
told
the
broadcaster
metro
tv
that
his
team
found
the
orange
cylinder
containing
the
recorder
among
debris
on
the
muddy
sea
floor
under
normal
conditions
the
data
should
only
take
two
hours
to
download
said
satmiko
although
analysing
it
could
take
several
weeks
the
results
from
a
preliminary
investigation
will
be
made
public
after
days
another
knkt
official
said
hopes
are
fading
of
finding
a
large
section
of
fuselage
intact
with
easily
retrievable
bodies
inside
what
is
important
for
us
is
to
get
more
information
about
the
victims
because
having
their
remains
back
is
important
for
us
so
we
can
bury
them
properly
