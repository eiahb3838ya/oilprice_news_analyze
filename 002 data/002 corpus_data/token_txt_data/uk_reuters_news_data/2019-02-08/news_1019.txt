lose
in
the
event

many
global

have
begun
to
scatter
senior
executives

staff
to
a
welter

inherited

a
more
than
institution

always
concentrated
its
operations
in
britain
will
set
up
two
additional
hubs

better
support
its
bond

the
amount
of
money
it
would
need
to
capitalize
its
frankfurt
entity
but
the
sum
required
by
the
main
berlin
subsidiary
is
expected
to
run
to
the
low
hundreds
of
millions
of
pounds
representing
less
than
percent
of
the
bank
s
overall
capital
lloyds
employs
around
people
in
berlin

a
full
management

the
frankfurt
subsidiary
will
not
need
