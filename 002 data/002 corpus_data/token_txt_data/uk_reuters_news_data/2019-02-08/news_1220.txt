zimbabwe
s
constitutional
court
confirmed
president
emmerson
mnangagwa
s
disputed
july
election
victory
on
friday
dismissing
an
opposition
challenge
that
had
held
up
his
inauguration
which
will
now
be
held
on
sunday
before
the
vote
mnangagwa
had
said
a
credible
election
could
pull
zimbabwe
out
of
its
diplomatic
isolation
under
former
president
robert
mugabe
ending
international
sanctions
and
prompting
an
economic
recovery
instead
the
vote
left
the
nation
polarised
with
nelson
chamisa
who
leads
the
opposition
movement
for
democratic
change
mdc
mounting
the
legal
challenge
and
violence
flaring
on
the
streets
of
harare
in
a
unanimous
ruling
of
the
nine
judges
of
the
country
s
top
court
chief
justice
luke
malaba
said
chamisa
had
failed
to
prove
allegations
of
fraud
during
the
presidential
vote
emmerson
dambudzo
mnangagwa
is
duly
declared
the
winner
of
the
presidential
elections
held
on
the
of
july
malaba
said
in
his
ruling
chamisa
had
earlier
said
he
reserved
the
right
to
take
alternative
actions
including
peaceful
protests
if
he
lost
the
legal
case
on
friday
he
did
not
spell
out
his
next
step
but
told
his
supporters
on
twitter
that
he
would
consult
them
on
the
course
of
action
to
be
taken
to
rescue
our
beautiful
zimbabwe
from
the
jaws
of
poverty
corruption
dishonesty
the
election
in
which
mnangagwa
and
chamisa
were
the
main
contenders
was
touted
as
a
crucial
step
towards
shedding
zimbabwe
s
pariah
reputation
and
securing
international
donor
funding
to
revive
an
economy
suffering
chronic
shortages
of
investment
and
cash
as
well
as
high
unemployment
an
army
crackdown
in
response
to
violence
by
opposition
supporters
left
six
people
dead
on
recalling
the
security
tactics
that
marked
the
rule
of
mugabe
who
was
removed
in
a
coup
last
november
mnangagwa
now
faces
the
challenge
of
persuading
the
international
community
that
the
army
crackdown
and
lapses
in
the
election
process
will
not
derail
his
promise
of
reforms
to
overcome
corruption
and
mismanagement
under
mugabe
after
the
ruling
was
delivered
the
president
called
for
peace
on
his
twitter
feed
nelson
chamisa
my
door
is
open
and
my
arms
are
outstretched

are
one

first

all
now
put

differences
behind
us

was
not
fair

enough
evidence
but
it
was
not
considered
