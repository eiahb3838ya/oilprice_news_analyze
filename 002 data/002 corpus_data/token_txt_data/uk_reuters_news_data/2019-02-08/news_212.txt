seamless nadal drubs australian duckworth in melbourne opener
melbourne
reuters
former
champion
rafa
nadal
showed
no
signs
of
discomfort
from
his
thigh
strain
as
he
sailed
through
to
the
second
round
of
the
australian
open
with
a
win
over
local
hope
james
duckworth
on
monday
the
spaniard
had
pulled
out
of
the
brisbane
warmup
with
a
thigh
strain
to
raise
doubts
about
his
campaign
but
he
allayed
those
fears
on
rod
laver
arena
against
an
opponent
it
s
normal
that
beginnings
are
tough
but
every
day
helps
and
every
day
makes
me
feel
better
makes
me
feel
more
confident
nadal
whose
season
ended
early
with
ankle
surgery
and
an
abdominal
injury
told
reporters
so
that
s
an
important
victory
because
it
is
the
first
victory
since
a
while
and
at
the
same
time
gives
me
the
chance
to
be
on
court
again
and
that
s
what
i
the
first
meeting
between
the
grand
slam
champion
a
winner
at
melbourne
park
in
and
australian
wildcard
duckworth
who
is
ranked
in
the
world
always
had
the
potential
to
be
an
uneven
contest
but
the
duckworth
who
reached
a
ranking
of
in
april
did
not
help
his
cause
by
looking
to
attack
nadal
from
the
start
and
committing
unforced
errors
in
the
process
compared
to
just
from
his
opponent
nadal
who
is
bidding
to
become
the
first
man
in
the
open
era
and
only
the
third
man
ever
to
win
each
of
the
four
grand
slams
twice
ran
his
opponent
down
with
his
superior
court
coverage
and
ability
to
hit
winners
under
pressure
i
played
against
a
player
today
he
went
on
court
with
the
determination
to
not
play
tennis
the
way
i
understand
tennis
nadal
told
reporters
it
is
not
a
negative
point
not
at
all
believe
me
he
went
on
court
probably
doing
a
thing
that
works
well
for
him
and
he
gives
himself
some
chances
and
he
played
smart
and
he
played
sporting
a
yellow
sleeveless
and
white
shorts
nadal
hit
his
gear
early
by
breaking
duckworth
s
serve
in
the
first
game
which
was
enough
for
him
to
take
out
the
first
set
after
an
early
trade
of
breaks
in
the
second
duckworth
served
his
sixth
double
fault
to
go
down
a
break
and
then
lost
the
second
set
with
his
eighth
two
brilliant
winners
in
the
sixth
game
which
brought
about
an
animated
celebration
from
the
spaniard
gave
him
a
break
and
a
lead
but
duckworth
got
the
break
back
in
the
ninth
game
the
spaniard
who
will
next
meet
the
winner
of
australian
matthew
ebden
s
contest
with
struff
of
germany
broke
duckworth
for
the
sixth
time
and
brought
an
end
to
the
match
with
a
brilliant
backhand
pass
in
his
news
conference
nadal
said
he
has
brought
a
remodelled
serve
to
melbourne
aimed
at
generating
more
pace
after
losing
two
service
games
in
the
match
nadal
was
pleased
with
it
my
serve
worked
well
i
don
t
know
my
percentage
but
was
a
lot
of
good
positions
after
the
first
serve
he
said
i
felt
solid
with
the
