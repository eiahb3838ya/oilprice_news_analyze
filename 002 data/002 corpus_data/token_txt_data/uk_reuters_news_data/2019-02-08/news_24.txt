germany to seek antitrust reform in 2020 eu presidency - source

germany
will
seek
to
reform
competition
law
during
its
european
union
presidency
in
a
government
source
told
reuters
on
wednesday
hours
after
antitrust
regulators
blocked
a
rail
deal
between
siemens
and
alstom
the
european
commission
said
the
deal
would
have
hurt
competition
and
led
to
higher
prices
for
consumers
dismissing
the
companies
argument
that
it
would
help
them
better
compete
against
chinese
rival
crrc
following
the
eu
veto
german
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
said
that
europe
should
look
at
changing
its
rules
to
facilitate
mergers
and
create
european
champions
which
can
compete
with
rivals
from
china
and
the
united
states
altmaier
launched
a
committee
of
antitrust
experts
last
year
to
modernise
german
and
european
competition
law
with
the
goal
of
safeguarding
germany
s
competitiveness
the
committee
has
identified
several
themes
to
look
into
such
as
whether
antitrust
laws
need
to
be
amended
to
enable
internationally
competitive
digital
companies
but
the
moves
have
concerned
some
and
fears
of
being
left
behind
china
and
the
united
states
with
their
different
antitrust
frameworks
should
not
drive
the
debate
in
europe
peter
alexiadis
a
partner
at
gibson
dunn
said
the
eu
is
a
thought
leader
in
antitrust
and
has
been
for
a
number
of
years
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
not
continue
to
do
so
especially
in
combination
with
international
fora
such
as
the
oecd
in
a
global
marketplace
unilateralism
will
get
us
nowhere
in
the
field
of
antitrust
he
said
still
there
is
room
for
updating
the
rules
he
said
we
probably
need
to
move
away
from
the
straightjacket
of
concerns
about
short
term
price
rises
and
develop
our
views
about
an
idea
of
consumer
welfare
that
is
more
dynamic
and
more
consistent
with
important
emerging
public
policy
values
common
across
all
eu
member
state
political
cultures
alexiadis
said
another
issue
being
looked
at
by
the
committee
is
whether
the
antitrust
regime
needs
to
allow
for
more
innovation
and
investment
in
key
technologies
the
committee
will
also
examine
whether
competition
laws
can
be
integrated
with
consumer
protection
and
consumer
protection
laws
the
committee
is
due
to
present
proposals
later
this
year
changes
in
eu
merger
rules
need
to
be
approved
by
all
eu
countries
and
consent
from
european
parliament
