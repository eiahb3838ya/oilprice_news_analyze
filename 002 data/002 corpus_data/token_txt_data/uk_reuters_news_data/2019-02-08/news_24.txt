world
stocks
fell
for
a
third
straight
day
on
friday
on
pessimism
about
global
economic
growth
and
trade
tensions
and
were
set
for
their
first
weekly
drop
this
year
while
the
dollar
was
on
track
for
its
biggest
weekly
gain
since

msci
s
gauge
of
stocks
across
the
globe
shed
percent
and
was
set
to
fall
this
week
following
six
consecutive
weekly
increases
investors
were
digesting
economic
and
trade
developments
from
a
day
earlier
when
the
european
commission
sharply
cut
its
forecasts
for
euro
zone
growth
this
year
and
next
while
president
donald
trump
said
he
did
not
plan
to
meet
with
chinese
president
xi
jinping
before
a
march
deadline
to
achieve
a
trade
deal
thursday
s
trade
developments
took
off
the
table
what
the
market
was
probably
starting
to
price
in
which
was
a
resolution
by
march
said
anthony
saglimbene
global
market
strategist
at
ameriprise
financial
in
troy
michigan
it
just
adds
to
the
fact
that
investors
want
some
of
these
trade
tensions
off
the
front
pages
and
it
doesn
t
look
like
we
are
going
to
get
that

said
on

fell
points

to
the

p
lost
points
or
percent
to
and
the
nasdaq

dropped
points
or
percent
to
slower
global
growth
trade
tensions
and
the
fact
that
we
have
moved
an
incredible
amount
off
of
the
december
lows
probably
means
that
stocks
were
a
little
bit
overbought
and
we
may
be
trading
in
a
range
for
a
little
while
saglimbene
said
the
stoxx
index
lost
percent
the
dollar
edged
higher
against
a
basket
of
currencies
keeping
it
on
track
for
its
strongest
weekly
gain
in
six
months
as
traders
piled
into
the
greenback
in
a
move
on
worries
about
a
weakening
global
economy
the
dollar
index
rose
percent
with
the
euro
down

to
the
rally
that
propelled
the
dollar
broadly
higher
last
year
has
enjoyed
renewed
life
with

solid
