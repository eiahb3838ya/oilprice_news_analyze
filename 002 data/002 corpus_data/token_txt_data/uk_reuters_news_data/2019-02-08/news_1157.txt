richard

has
returned
to
china
the
chinese
giant
said
on
monday
days
after
he
was

by

in
the
city
of
minneapolis
on
suspicion
of
criminal
sexual

ongoing

said
that
the
accusation
against
liu
was
unsubstantiated
a
lawyer
for
liu
earl
gray
said
liu
denies
any
wrongdoing
and
added
he
does
not
expect
his
client
to
be
charged
noting
that
liu
was
released
without
charges
or
bail
and
was
allowed
to
return
to
china
under
these
circumstances
based
on
our
substantial
experience
in
the
criminal
justice
system
in
minnesota
charges
are
highly
unlikely
in
the
future
to
be
brought
against
our
client
gray
said
in
an
emailed
statement
minneapolis
police
said
on
sunday
that
an
active
investigation
was
under
way
although
it
was
possible
for
the
billionaire
founder
of
the
firm
to
leave
the
united
states
reuters
has
not
been
able
to
reach
liu
for
comment
we
don
t
know
if
there
will
be
charges
or
not
because
we
haven
t
concluded
an
investigation
john
elder
a
spokesman
for
the
minneapolis
police
department
told
reuters
on
sunday
he
declined
to
provide
details
of
the
arrest
in
addition
to
making
liu
the
chinese
businessperson
to
be
accused
publicly
of
sexual
misconduct
the
case
has
raised
concerns
that
could
face
difficulties
making
decisions
due
to
its
unusual
governance
structure
the
company
is
backed
by
walmart
inc
alphabet
inc
s
google
and
china
s
tencent
holdings
s
rules
require
liu
who
holds
nearly
percent
of
the
company
s
voting
rights
to
be
present
at
board
meetings
for
the
board
to
make
decisions
although
it
was
not
immediately
clear
if
he
has
to
be
physically
present
or
could
participate
by
teleconference
i
m
not
aware
of
any
other
company
that
has
similar
rules
said
chris
leahy
of
advisory
firm
blackpeak
and
a
corporate
governance
expert
if
the
board
isn
t
quorate
without
richard
liu
if
he
is
unable
to
attend
and
if
there
are
no
other
provisions
that
offer
a
way
round
that
the
company
could
become
ungovernable
