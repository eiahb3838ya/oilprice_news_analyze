apple
inc
facing
a
court
ban
in
china
on
some
of
its
iphone
models
over
alleged
infringement
of
qualcomm
inc
patents
said
on
friday
it
will
push
software
updates
to
users
in
a
bid
to
resolve
potential
issues
apple
will
carry
out
the
software
updates
at
the
start
of
next
week
to
address
any
possible
concern
about
our
compliance
with
the
order
the
firm
said
in
a
statement
sent
to
reuters
earlier
this
week
qualcomm
said
a
chinese
court
had
ordered
a
ban
on
sales
of
some
older
iphone
models
for
violating
two
of
its
patents
though
intellectual
property
lawyers
said
the
ban
would
likely
take
time
to
enforce
based
on
the
iphone
models
we
offer
today
in
china
we
believe
we
are
in
compliance
apple
said
early
next
week
we
will
deliver
a
software
update
for
iphone
users
in
china
addressing
the
minor
functionality
of
the
two
patents
at
issue
in
the
in
a
statement
qualcomm
s
general
counsel
don
rosenberg
said
apple
continues
to
disregard
and
violate
the
fuzhou
court
s
orders
despite
the
planned
software
changes
they
are
legally
obligated
to
immediately
cease
sales
offers
for
sale
and
importation
of
the
devices
identified
in
the
orders
and
to
prove
compliance
in
court
he
said
in
the
statement
the
case
brought
by
qualcomm
is
part
of
a
global
patent
dispute
between
the
two
companies
that
includes
dozens
of
lawsuits
it
creates
uncertainty
over
apple
s
business
in
one
of
its
biggest
markets
at
a
time
when
concerns
over
waning
demand
for
new
iphones
are
battering
its
shares
qualcomm
has
said
the
fuzhou
intermediate
people
s
court
in
china
found
apple
infringed
two
patents
held
by
the
chipmaker
and
ordered
an
immediate
ban
on
sales
of
older
iphone
models
from
the
through
the
apple
has
filed
a
request
for
reconsideration
with
the
court
a
copy
of
which
qualcomm
shared
with
reuters
qualcomm
and
apple
disagree
about
whether
the
court
order
means
iphone
sales
must
be
halted
the
court
s
preliminary
injunction
which
the
chipmaker
also
shared
with
reuters
orders
an
immediate
block
though
lawyers
say
apple
could
take
steps
to
stall
the
process
all
iphone
models
were
available
for
purchase
on
apple
s
china
website
on
friday
qualcomm
the
biggest
supplier
of
chips
for
mobile
phones
filed
its
case
against
apple
in
china
in
late
saying
the
iphone
maker
infringed
patents
on
features
related
to
resizing
photographs
and
managing
apps
on
a
touch
screen
apple
argues
the
injunction
should
be
lifted
as
continuing
to
sell
iphones
does
not
constitute
irreparable
harm
to
qualcomm
a
key
consideration
for
a
preliminary
injunction
the
copy
of
its
reconsideration
request
dated
shows
that
s
one
of
the
reasons
why
in
a
very
complicated
patent
litigation
case
the
judge
would
be
reluctant
to
grant
a
preliminary
injunction
said
yiqiang
li
a
patent
lawyer
at
faegre
baker
daniels
apple
s
reconsideration
request
also
says
any
ban
on
iphone
sales
would
impact
its
chinese
suppliers
and
consumers
as
well
as
the
tax
revenue
it
pays
to
authorities
the
request
adds
the
injunction
could
force
apple
to
settle
with
qualcomm
but
it
was
not
clear
whether
this
referred
to
the
latest
case
or
their
broader
legal
dispute
qualcomm
has
paid
a
million
yuan
million
bond
to
cover
potential
damages
to
apple
from
a
sales
ban
and
apple
is
willing
to
pay
a
counter
security
of
double
that
to
get
the
ban
lifted
the
copy
of
the
reconsideration
request
shows
apple
did
not
immediately
respond
to
questions
about
the
reconsideration
request
and
reuters
was
not
independently
able
to
confirm
its
authenticity
yiqiang
li
said
the
case
would
undoubtedly
ramp
up
pressure
on
apple
especially
if
a
ban
was
enforced
i
think
that
qualcomm
and
apple
they
always
have
those
ip
litigations
to
try
to
force
the
other
side
to
make
concessions
they
try
to
get
their
inch
somewhere
that

always
