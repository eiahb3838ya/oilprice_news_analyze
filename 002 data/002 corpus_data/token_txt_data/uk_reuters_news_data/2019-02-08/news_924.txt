brexit talks must focus on divorce deal before future ties - czech official
brussels
reuters
britain
and
the
european
union
must
focus
on
getting
a
divorce
deal
with
an
irish
border
fix
before
they
embark
on
discussions
on
their
trade
ties
the
czech
republic
s
pointman
on
europe
said
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
eu
in
days
but
talks
on
managing
the
unprecedented
split
have
stalled
over
differences
on
how
to
avoid
border
checks
between
ireland
and
britain
s
province
of
northern
ireland
officials
expect
a
flurry
of
negotiations
after
wednesday
s
speech
by
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
closing
the
annual
conservative
party
conference
as
both
sides
seek
to
break
the
deadlock
in
time
for
an
eu
summit
in
two
weeks
the
chief
concern
for
the
eu
right
now
is
reaching
a
deal
on
the
withdrawal
agreement
that
would
provide
us
with
a
two
year
transition
period
in
which
to
set
out
the
future
relationship
between
the
eu
and
the
uk
state
secretary
for
european
affairs
ales
chmelar
said
adding
divorce
must
cover
an
irish
fix
britain
s
preferred
option
is
focusing
on
agreeing
close
future
trade
ties
london
wants
this
arrangement
to
regulate
the
irish
border
but
the
bloc
wants
an
emergency
solution
if
trade
talks
fail
or
take
longer
the
future
relationship
is
a
matter
for
future
discussions
without
the
withdrawal
agreement
we
are
very
soon
heading
towards
a
scenario
in
which
a
hard
border
would
inevitably
be
drawn
up
chmelar
said
as
both
sides
ready
concessions
britain
is
expected
to
present
a
new
proposal
for
the
irish
border
soon
the
other
eu
member
states
will
put
in
writing
for
the
first
time
next
week
their
free
trade
proposal
for
britain
for
after
brexit
hoping
a
more
promise
would
woo
london
into
compromises
on
ireland
and
help
may
get
enough
support
behind
any
divorce
deal
however
eu
negotiators
are
also
keen
to
maintain
the
sequencing
used
to
keep
up
pressure
on
london
to
first
deal
with
the
irish
issue
in
order
to
ensure
a
smooth
exit
from
the
bloc
before
brussels
will
fully
engage
on
a
future
trade
deal
the
leaders
scheduled
a
crunch
summit
dinner
in
brussels
for
wednesday
the
evening
before
may
joins
them
for
a
quarterly
meeting
that
is
the
point
at
which
the
eu
hopes
that
the
outline
of
an
exit
deal
is
agreed
if
it
is
more
talks
will
follow
on
the
future
relationship
in
the
hope
that
a
further
summit
on
can
wrap
up
both
elements
of
the
accord
the
eu
rejected
london
s
previous
fix
for
ireland
last
june
because
it
envisaged
only
a
emergency
border
backstop
and
assumed
all
of
the
uk
would
remain
in
the
eu
s
customs
area
for
a
while
after
brexit
eu
diplomats
and
negotiating
officials
stress
they
have
not
yet
seen
the
new
british
plan
but
warned
against
recasting
what
was
already
discussed
after
britain
s
brexit
minister
dominic
raab
told
his
party
s
conference
we
said
we
would
need
to
retain
a
customs
we
will
be
open
to
looking
at
some
of
the
options
on
regulatory
checks
he
added
though
it
was
not
sure
if
that
would
also
cover
manufactured
goods
northern
ireland
s
democratic
unionist
party
on
whose
support
may
relies
to

quick
on
tuesday
to
reject
differing
regulation

the
rest
of
the
uk
after
brexit
