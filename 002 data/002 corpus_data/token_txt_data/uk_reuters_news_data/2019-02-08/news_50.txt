melbourne
reuters
developers
have
lost
a
court
appeal
to
build
a
coal
mine
in
australia
s
hunter
valley
over
its
potentially
dire
environmental
impact
in
the
country
s
first
legal
review
of
a
coal
mine
project
to
hear
evidence
from
a
climate
scientist
in
the
landmark
ruling
justice
brian
preston
on
friday
denied
the
appeal
on
the
rocky
hill
project
in
new
south
wales
state
citing
an
increase
in
greenhouse
gas
emissions
as
well
as
uncertain
economic
benefits
and
adverse
social
and
visual
impacts
the
rocky
hill
project
was
developed
by
privately
held
gloucester
resources
a
unit
of
grl
holdings
pty
ltd
which
has
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
new
south
wales
supreme
court
gloucester
resources
limited
will
assess
the
implications
of
today
s
decision
and
consider
its
next
steps
it
said
in
a
statement
australia
is
the
world
s
biggest
coal
exporter
and
the
fuel
is
its
largest
resources
earner
canberra
last
year
scrapped
plans
for
a
national
energy
policy
that
aimed
to
cut
carbon
emissions
as
well
as
power
prices
in
part
due
to
opposition
from
coal
supporters
within
its
ranks
in
his
ruling
the
judge
found
that
mine
and
associated
greenhouse
gas
ghg
emissions
would
add
to
the
global
total
at
a
time
when
what
is
now
urgently
needed
in
order
to
meet
generally
agreed
climate
targets
is
a
rapid
and
deep
decrease
in
ghg
in
short
an
open
cut
coal
mine
in
this
part
of
the
gloucester
valley
would
be
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
preston
found
these
dire
consequences
should
be
at
the
end
of
january
the
organisation
of
economic
cooperation
and
development
made
waves
in
australia
when
it
said
the
country
needed
to
cut
emissions
more
sharply
to
meet
its
paris
climate
accord
target
as
the
country
remained
heavily
dependent
on
power
but
on
thursday
a
study
published
earlier
on
friday
by
australian
national
university
anu
researchers
found
the
country
is
adopting
renewable
energy
faster
per
capita
than
the
rest
of
the
world
rapid
recent
growth
in
wind
and
solar
power
has
left
it
on
track
to
meet
paris
carbon
emissions
reductions
targets
well
before
it
found
the
ruling
was
set
to
make
developing
new
coal
mines
or
expanding
existing
projects
more
challenging
said
shaw
partners
analyst
peter
o
connor
on
first
pass
it
doesn
t
read
well
for
the
industry
he
said
and
it
does
indicate
an
ongoing
and
increased
level
of
scrutiny
of
this
industry
which
is
only
likely
to
become
shares
in
coal
miners
whitehaven
and
new
hope
which
both
have
coal
projects
on
the
drawing
board
fell
and
percent
respectively
by
gmt
on
friday
in
line
with
lower
australian
thermal
coal
prices
whitehaven
declined
to
comment
on
whether
it
expects
any
impact
on
its
own
development
plans
new
hope
officials
couldn
t
immediately
be
reached
environmental
campaigners
welcomed
the
court
ruling
the
chief
executive
of
australia
s
climate
council
amanda
mckenzie
said
australia
must
continue
to
transition
away
from
fossil
fuels
and
embrace
renewable
energy
with
storage
the
science
says
so
and
now
the
law
does
too
