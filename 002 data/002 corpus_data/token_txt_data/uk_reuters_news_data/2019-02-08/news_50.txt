eu irks britain by calling gibraltar a 'colony'
brussels
reuters
britain
complained
about
the
european
union
calling
gibraltar
a
colony
in
a
piece
of
draft
legislation
on
friday
highlighting
how
the
eu
is
lining
up
behind
spain
in
its
territorial
dispute
as
britain
quits
the
bloc
the
remaining
member
states
agreed
to
offer
britons
travel
to
the
eu
after
brexit
in
march
even
if
talks
on
a
broader
withdrawal
treaty
collapse
on
condition
that
britain
offers
the
same
terms
to
eu
citizens
visiting
for
up
to
days
but
diplomats
said
britain
s
ambassador
to
the
eu
had
objected
to
the
wording
of
the
text
it
placed
the
people
of
gibraltar
in
a
different
category
from
uk
citizens
with
the
same
travel
rights
and
it
also
spelled
out
spain
s
claim
to
sovereignty
over
the
rock
at
the
united
nations
in
particular
it
stated
gibraltar
is
a
colony
of
the
british
crown
there
is
a
controversy
between
spain
and
the
united
kingdom
concerning
the
sovereignty
over
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
spokesman
insisted
gibraltar
was
not
a
colony
the
port
at
the
mouth
of
the
mediterranean
ceded
to
britain
by
spain
in
after
a
war
was
a
crown
colony
when
britain
joined
the
european
bloc
in
but
london
reclassified
it
as
a
british
overseas
territory
in
gibraltar
is
not
a
colony
and
it
is
completely
inappropriate
to
describe
in
this
way
a
british
spokeswoman
said
gibraltar
is
a
full
part
of
the
uk
the
wording
has
however
been
used
in
other
eu
texts
the
european
court
of
justice
said
in
rulings
in
and
that
gibraltar
was
a
colony
of
the
british
crown
and
not
part
of
the
united
kingdom
britain
had
not
raised
specific
objections
to
the
wording
in
those
cases
officials
said
but
was
irritated
by
spain
s
push
to
push
the
phrase
and
the
sovereignty
dispute
into
legislation
in
the
present
circumstances
spain
s
claim
to
sovereignty
makes
use
of
rules
on
decolonisation
those
among
other
things
limit
the
weight
given
to
the
preferences
of
people
living
in
a
territory
gibraltarians
favour
remaining
british
despite
having
voted
overwhelmingly
against
brexit
in
the
referendum
spain
had
sought
a
more
sweeping
reference
to
un
resolutions
on
colonies
diplomats
said
but
france
objected
to
protect
its
interests
in
some
of
its
own
overseas
territories
the
text
agreed
by
the
governments
will
be
discussed
by
the
european
parliament
and
the
eu
executive
in
order
to
finalise
a
regulation
giving
britons
access
recalling
how
eu
policy
on
gibraltar
had
so
far
largely
favoured
britain
which
joined
the
bloc
before
spain
a
senior
eu
official
told
reuters
recently
now
the
table
has
the
union
position
was
the
british
position
but
with
brexit
the
union
position
is
now
the
spanish
position
we
will
always
take
the
side
of
a
member
against
a
the
official
said
spain
has
already
secured
a
right
of
veto
over
whether
future
brexit
arrangements
can
apply
to
gibraltar
prime
minister
pedro
sanchez
held
up
an
agreement
on
the
current
withdrawal
treaty
in
november
over
the
issue
and
said
spain
would
seek
joint
sovereignty
after
britain
leaves
the
eu
spanish
sources
said
this
week
that
madrid
would
insist
on
excluding
gibraltar
from
all
agreements
between
britain
and
the
eu
once
britain
has
left
but
there
is
concern
among
other
eu
countries
that
madrid
s
hard
line
could
disrupt
efforts
to
ease
britain
out
of
the
bloc
eu
diplomats
point
to
the
territorial
issue
as
one
of
those
that
could
fray
the
unity
the
have
shown
in
negotiations
so
far
