boris
johnson
britain
s
former
foreign
secretary
on
sunday
called
on
the
government
to
use
its
international
aid
budget
to
focus
on
national
priorities
amid
speculation
about
whether
he
will
challenge
prime
minister
theresa
may
johnson
who
left
the
government
during
the
summer
over
his
opposition
to
may
s
brexit
plans
and
is
the
bookmakers
favourite
to
replace
her
has
declined
to
say
whether
he
would
challenge
her
for
the
leadership
in
his
latest
newspaper
column
johnson
did
not
mention
brexit
and
instead
said
britain
s
aid
budget
should
be
shifted
to
projects
consistent
with
the
political
and
commercial
priorities
of
this
everywhere
you
go
you
will
find
other
countries
that
subtly
or
openly
use
their
development
aid
budgets
as
leverage
to
support
their
exports
or
other
popular
objectives
johnson
said
it
was
infuriating
to
travel
to
south
east
asia
and
see
for
instance
how
japanese
contractors
were
supported
by
development
assistance
as
they
applied
for
contracts
in
ways
we
deem
to
be
britain
has
an
aid
budget
at
percent
of
economic
output
and
the
target
has
previously
come
under
fire
from
lawmakers
who
say
it
is
a
blunt
tool
that
is
too
high
and
should
be
spent
in
britain
itself
if
we
are
going
to
spend
so
much
on
aid
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
wins
britain
friends
and
admirers
around
the
world
then
let
s
get
value
for
this
country
as
well
