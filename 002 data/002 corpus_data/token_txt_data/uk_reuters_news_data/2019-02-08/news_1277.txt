washington
reuters
china
s
military
has
expanded
its
bomber
operations
in
recent
years
while
likely
training
for
strikes
against
the
united
states
and
its
allies
a
pentagon
report
released
on
thursday
said
the
assessment
which
comes
at
a
time
of
heightened
tensions
over
trade
was
contained
in
an
annual
report
that
highlighted
china
s
efforts
to
increase
its
global
influence
with
defence
spending
that
the
pentagon
estimates
exceeded
billion
in
over
the
last
three
years
the
pla
has
rapidly
expanded
its
overwater
bomber
operating
areas
gaining
experience
in
critical
maritime
regions
and
likely
training
for
strikes
against
and
allied
targets
the
report
said
using
an
acronym
for
china
s
people
s
liberation
army
the
report
comes
as
china
and
the
united
states
plan
to
hold
trade
talks
offering
hope
they
might
resolve
an
escalating
tariff
conflict
that
threatens
to
degenerate
into
an
trade
war
the
report
said
that
while
the
pla
had
continued
to
extend
operations
it
was
not
clear
what
message
beijing
was
seeking
to
send
by
carrying
out
the
flights
beyond
a
demonstration
of
improved
the
chinese
embassy
in
washington
could
not
immediately
be
reached
for
comment
this
year
china
s
air
force
landed
bombers
on
islands
and
reefs
in
the
south
china
sea
as
part
of
a
training
exercise
in
the
disputed
region
in
january
the
pentagon
put
countering
beijing
along
with
russia
at
the
centre
of
a
new
national
defence
strategy
while
washington
and
beijing
maintain
a
relationship
aimed
at
containing
tensions
this
has
been
tested
in
recent
months
notably
in
may
when
the
pentagon
withdrew
an
invitation
to
china
to
join
a
multinational
naval
exercise
in
june
defense
secretary
jim
mattis
became
the
first
pentagon
chief
to
visit
china
since
the
pentagon
report
said
that
despite
a
projected
slowdown
in
economic
growth
china
s
official
defence
budget
would
be
more
than
billion
by
the
pentagon
report
also
said
china
s
space
program
was
progressing
rapidly
the
pla
continues
to
strengthen
its
military
space
capabilities
despite
its
public
stance
against
the
militarization
of
space
it
said
this
month
president
donald
trump
s
administration
announced
an
ambitious
plan
to
usher
in
a
new
space
force
as
the
sixth
branch
of
the
military
by
one
of
the
arguments
in
favour
of
developing
such
a
force
is
that
american
rivals
like
china
appear
increasingly
ready
to
strike
capabilities
in
the
event
of
a
conflict
