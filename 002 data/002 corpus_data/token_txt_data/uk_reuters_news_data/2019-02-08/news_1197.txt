s
trade
concessions
on
autos
and
labor
rights

rejoined

while

warned

a
bilateral
trade
deal
would
struggle

win
approval
in
congress
automotive
executives
and
other
sources
also
told

that
the
bilateral

announced
on
monday
allows
president
donald
trump
to
impose
percent
tariffs
on
imports
of
passenger
vehicles
and
auto
parts
above
certain
volumes
if
trump
proceeds
with
the
tariffs
now
under
consideration
based
on
national
security
concerns
mexican
exports
of
cars
and
vehicles
to
the
united
states
would
be
capped
at
million
vehicles
annually
volumes
above
that
level
would
be
subject
to
tariffs
auto
industry
officials
and
other
sources
said
canadian
foreign
minister
chrystia
freeland
said
that
mexico
s
difficult
concessions
to
the
united
states
on
monday
would
pave
the
way
for
productive
talks
this
week
as
all
three
countries
race
toward
a
friday
deadline
for
a
deal
to
modernize
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
these
concessions
are
really
going
to
be
important
for
workers
in
canada
and
the
united
states
she
told
reporters
after
meeting
with
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
freeland
who
later
met
with
mexican
officials
on
tuesday
evening
said
she
is
due
to
dig
into
detailed
discussions
with
lighthizer
on
wednesday
trump
warned
on
monday
he
could
proceed
with
a
deal
with
mexico
alone
and
levy
tariffs
on
canada
if
it
does
not
come
on
board
with
the
revised
trade
terms
after
being
sidelined
from
the
talks
for
more
than
two
months
freeland
will
be
under
pressure
to
accept
terms
the
united
states
and
mexico
worked
out
on
a
trade
deal
announced
on
monday
one
of
the
main
sticking
points
for
canada
in
the
revised
deal
is
the
effort
to
dump
the
chapter
dispute
resolution
mechanism
that
hinders
the
united
states
from
pursuing
and
cases
lighthizer
said
on
monday
that
mexico
had
agreed
to
eliminate
the
mechanism
other
hurdles
include
intellectual
property
rights
such
as
the
data
exclusivity
for
biologic
drug
makers
and
extensions
of
copyright
protections
to
years
from
all
higher
thresholds
than
canada
has
previously
supported
dan
ujczo
a
columbus
trade
lawyer
who
focuses
on
issues
said
it
would
be
hard
for
freeland
to
win
concessions
from
lighthizer
on
these
issues
i
think
he
s
going
to
sit
there
with
his
arms
folded
a
lot
ujczo
added
mexican
foreign
minister
luis
videgaray
told
mexican
television
on
tuesday
the
three
sides
would
work
for
a
deal
we
are
now
going
to
devote
long
hours
to
the
negotiation
with
canada
he
said
negotiations
among
the
three
partners
whose
mutual
trade
totals
more
than
trillion
annually
have
dragged
on
for
more
than
a
year
putting
pressure
on
the
mexican
peso
and
the
canadian
dollar
both
currencies
gained
against
the
dollar
on
monday
but
the
peso
weakened
on
tuesday
if
a
deal
is
not
reached
with
canada
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
has
said
the
trump
administration
intends
to
proceed
with
a
separate
trade
agreement
with
mexico
the
mexican
government
has
also
taken
that
position
even
as
it
says
it
wants
a
trilateral
deal
mexican
president
enrique
pena
nieto
is
keen
to
sign
the
agreement
before
leaving
office
at
the
end
of
november
some
lawmakers
said
however
that
a
bilateral
pact
could
lose
the
benefits
of
negotiating
authority
which
calls
for
a
trilateral
deal
a
trilateral
deal
would
need
only
votes
in
the
senate
while
a
bilateral
pact
would
need
a
far
more
difficult
threshold
republican
senator
pat
toomey
said
if
republicans
retain
of
the
senate
s
seats
in
november
elections
they
could
approve
a
new
nafta
agreement
next
year
without
the
support
of
democrats
canada
s
main
stock
index
opened
higher
on
tuesday
on
hopes
for
a
nafta
trade
deal
before
ending
lower
stocks
edged
to
record
highs
for
a
third
consecutive
session
trump
said
he
still
could
put
tariffs
on
cars
if
canada
did
not
join
its
neighbors
and
warned
he
expected
concessions
on
canada
s
dairy
protections
canada
s
dairy
farmers
operate
under
a
protectionist
system
that
manages
supplies
and
prices
and
imposes
high
tariffs
to
limit
imports
demands
have
ranged
from
ending
those
tariffs
to
scrapping
a
pricing
system
for
milk
ingredients
that
hurt
exports
of
milk
proteins
it
seems
like
a
pretty
steep
challenge
to
now
resolve
these
issues
in
three
days
said
david
wines
a
manitoba
dairy
farmer
and
vice
president
of
industry
group
dairy
farmers
of
canada
if
talks
with
canada
are
not
wrapped
up
by
friday
trump
plans
to
notify
congress
that
he
intends
to
sign
a
deal
with
mexico
but
would
be
open
to
canada
joining
lighthizer
told
reporters
on
monday
the
white
house
has
said
trump
will
sign
the
deal
days
after
notification
congress
needs
to
approve
it
in
a
process
that
will
take
several
months
