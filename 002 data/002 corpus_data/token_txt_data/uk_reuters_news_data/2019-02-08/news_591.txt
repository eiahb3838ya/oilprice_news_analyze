prime
minister
theresa
may
said
on
thursday
that
had
produced
an
alternative
to
her
brexit
plan
and
that
all
options
involved
a
backstop
arrangement
that
has
been
criticised
by
many
in
her
own
party
nobody
has
produced
any
alternative
proposal
may
told
reporters
at
a
news
conference
adding
that
repudiating
a
backstop
altogether
would
kill
any
chance
of
a
deal
with
the
european
union
if
we
do
not
move
forward
with
that
agreement
nobody
can
know
for
sure
the
consequences
that
will
follow
it
would
be
to
take
a
path
of
deep
and
grave
uncertainty
when
the
british
people
just
want
us
to
get
on
with
it
