britain
s
biggest
retailer
tesco
is
going
with
german
discounters
aldi
and
lidl
on
price
with
a
new
grocery
store
it
says
will
be
the
cheapest
in
town
chief
executive
dave
lewis
unveiled
tesco
s
new
jack
s
format
on
wednesday
saying
it
would
sell
essential
items
including
jack
products
that
compares
with
the
thousands
of
goods
on
sale
in
its
traditional
supermarkets
and
mimics
the
german
chains
focus
on
simplicity
and
to
keep
costs
down
a
strategy
that
has
seen
them
grab
percent
of
britain
s
grocery
market
some
jack
s
stores
will
open
over
the
next
six
months
with
the
first
two
on
thursday
at
chatteris
and
immingham
in
eastern
england
jack
s
is
named
after
jack
cohen
who
in
founded
the
business
that
became
tesco
and
is
a
significant
move
by
lewis
who
has
rebuilt
tesco
after
a
accounting
scandal
capped
a
dramatic
downturn
in
trading
but
the
limited
number
of
openings
and
initial
capital
expenditure
of
about
million
pounds
disappointed
some
analysts
as
media
reports
had
said
that
up
to
existing
tesco
outlets
could
be
converted
this
is
first
and
foremost
about
how
we
celebrate
the
centenary
lewis
told
reporters
at
the
chatteris
store
which
was
built
as
a
tesco
supermarket
but
mothballed
in
when
the
group
was
in
crisis
we
only
have
plans
for
if
we
feel
that
customers
are
absolutely
supportive
of
what
we
re
doing
then
yes
of
course
we
have
optionality
going
forward
he
said
and
he
played
down
jack
s
financial
significance
to
the
group
it
s
not
a
calculation
that
we
re
currently
doing
he
said
shares
in
tesco
were
up
percent
at
gmt
patrick
o
brian
research
director
at
globaldata
had
expected
a
bolder
store
opening
schedule
aldi
and
lidl
are
unlikely
to
be
too
concerned
about
this
opening
salvo
he
said
some
tesco
investors
were
however
thrilled
jack
s
fits
perfectly
into
the
current
consumer
zeitgeist
and
will
drive
revenues
as
well
as
protecting
margins
across
the
tesco
group
said
freddie
lait
chief
investment
officer
of
latitude
investment
management
aldi
and
lidl
have
steadily
grown
market
share
in
britain
since
the
financial
crisis
chipping
away
at
tesco
and
its
three
biggest
rivals
sainsbury
s
asda
and
morrisons
the
intention
is
for
us
to
be
the
cheapest
in
town
said
lewis
adding
jack
s
could
benefit
from
tesco
s
buying
power
eight
out
of
ten
of
jack
s
food
and
drink
products
are
grown
reared
or
made
in
britain
a
large
chicken
is
priced
at
pounds
while
four
pints
of
semi
skimmed
milk
will
cost
pounds
the
stores
will
also
stock
some
familiar
major
brands
such
as
coca
cola
as
well
as
a
range
of
general
merchandise
on
a
when
it
s
gone
it
s
gone
basis
jack
s
stores
will
be
a
mixture
of
entirely
new
sites
sites
adjacent
to
existing
tesco
stores
and
converted
tesco
stores
tesco
currently
has
a
percent
share
of
britain
s
grocery
market
according
to
the
latest
industry
data
although
it
could
be
overtaken
by
sainsbury
s
proposed
billion
pound
takeover
of
asda
the
between
tesco
s
two
nearest
competitors
which
regulators
on
wednesday
said
would
be
scrutinised
in
depth
is
also
driven
at
least
in
part
by
the
rise
of
the
discounters
britain
s
big
four
grocers
are
trying
to
adapt
to
changing
habits
including
the
declining
popularity
of
big
weekly
shops
and
the
growth
of
online
shopping
they
have
cut
prices
and
improved
service
but
analysts
say
that
with
sales
at
aldi
and
lidl
growing
at
percent
each
year
it
makes
sense
for
tesco
to
try
to
capture
some
of
that
growth
analysts
do
however
have
concerns
that
jack
s
could
take
sales
from
tesco
s
existing
stores

down

lewis

rather
cannibalise
myself
than
somebody
