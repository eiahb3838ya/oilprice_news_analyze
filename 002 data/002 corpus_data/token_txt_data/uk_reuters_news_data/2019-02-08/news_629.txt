french remarks on khashoggi affair prompt turkish anger
ankara
reuters
turkey
reacted
with
fury
on
monday
after
french
foreign
minister
le
drian
said
president
tayyip
erdogan
was
playing
a
political
game
over
sharing
intelligence
about
the
killing
of
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
le
drian
had
questioned
remarks
by
erdogan
at
the
weekend
in
which
he
said
turkey
gave
tapes
relating
to
khashoggi
s
killing
to
the
united
states
saudi
arabia
germany
france
and
britain
le
drian
said
he
was
not
aware
that
france
had
any
tapes
asked
if
erdogan
was
lying
he
said
he
has
a
political
game
to
play
in
these
circumstances
that
prompted
a
furious
response
from
ankara
which
insisted
it
had
shared
evidence
with
paris
and
said
le
drian
s
comments
were
unacceptable
our
intelligence
shared
information
with
them
on
oct
including
the
voice
recordings
foreign
minister
mevlut
cavusoglu
said
it
is
very
impudent
for
them
to
accuse
our
president
of
playing
political
what
s
behind
the
remarks
of
the
french
foreign
minister
i
wonder
if
they
are
trying
to
cover
up
the
murder
he
added
the
furious
turkish
remarks
towards
france
were
the
most
direct
public
expression
yet
of
a
concern
in
ankara
that
western
countries
with
close
commercial
relations
with
riyadh
might
their
response
to
the
khashoggi
killing
seeking
to
clarify
le
drian
s
comments
a
senior
french
diplomat
later
said
the
minister
never
commented
on
intelligence
shared
between
countries
and
that
he
was
neither
confirming
or
denying
french
officials
having
listened
to
recordings
what
counts
for
us
is
to
establish
the
complete
truth
whatever
one
may
think
of
the
recordings
the
entire
truth
can
t
be
based
on
the
turkish
recordings
we
are
still
waiting
for
elements
from
the
saudis
the
diplomat
said
the
dispute
between
ankara
and
paris
may
hinge
on
erdogan
s
account
that
turkey
gave
recordings
to
the
other
countries
turkish
officials
said
instead
that
france
had
been
allowed
to
hear
a
recording
and
blamed
france
for
the
misunderstanding
if
there
is
miscommunication
between
the
french
government
s
various
agencies
it
is
up
to
the
french
authorities
not
turkey
to
take
care
of
that
problem
