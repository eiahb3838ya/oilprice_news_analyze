washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
on
thursday
cancelled
a
planned
visit
later
this
month
to
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
switzerland
signalling
he
was
prepared
for
the
political
showdown
over
the
partial
federal
government
shutdown
to
stretch
into
late
january
it
was
unclear
whether
the
shutdown
now
in
its
day
would
end
before
the
start
of
the
global
economic
meeting
which
is
scheduled
for
to
trump
and
congressional
democrats
are
in
a
battle
over
funding
for
the
government
and
trump
s
wall
along
the
border
because
of
the
democrats
intransigence
on
border
security
and
the
great
importance
of
safety
for
our
nation
i
am
respectfully
cancelling
my
very
important
trip
to
davos
switzerland
for
the
world
economic
forum
trump
wrote
on
twitter
the
president
had
told
reporters
at
the
white
house
earlier
on
thursday
that
he
intended
to
speak
at
the
forum
but
would
not
attend
if
the
shutdown
continued
the
cancellation
quashes
any
opportunity
for
trump
to
meet
with
other
world
leaders
about
economic
issues
including
trade
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
told
reporters
after
a
briefing
with
lawmakers
on
capitol
hill
that
he
was
talking
with
the
white
house
about
whether
he
would
still
make
the
trip
to
switzerland
my
guess
is
if
we
do
continue
it
it
will
be
in
a
version
mnuchin
said
the
trump
administration
is
engaged
in
trade
talks
with
the
european
union
and
china
among
others
china
and
the
united
states
have
agreed
to
a
pause
in
implementing
tariffs
in
order
to
hammer
out
a
trade
deal
china
s
vice
president
wang
qishan
was
expected
to
attend
the
swiss
meeting
but
it
was
unclear
whether
any
talks
had
been
planned
between
him
and
trump
