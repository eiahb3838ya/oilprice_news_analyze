reuters
president
donald
trump
said
on
thursday
he
presumes
missing
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
is
dead
and
that
the
response
to
saudi
arabia
will
likely
be
very
severe
but
that
he
still
wanted
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
exactly
happened
turkish
police
are
searching
a
forest
on
the
outskirts
of
istanbul
and
a
city
near
the
sea
of
marmara
for
the
remains
of
khashoggi
more
than
two
weeks
after
he
vanished
after
entering
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
two
senior
turkish
officials
told
reuters
trump
who
has
forged
closer
ties
with
saudi
arabia
and
the
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
acknowledged
for
the
first
time
on
thursday
that
khashoggi
a
resident
and
washington
post
columnist
had
likely
been
killed
it
certainly
looks
that
way
to
me
it
s
very
sad
trump
told
reporters
before
boarding
air
force
one
on
a
political
trip
in
an
interview
with
the
new
york
times
on
thursday
trump
based
his
acknowledgment
that
khashoggi
was
dead
on
intelligence
reports
turkish
officials
have
said
they
believe
khashoggi
was
murdered
at
the
consulate
and
his
body
chopped
up
and
removed
riyadh
strongly
denies
the
allegations
and
said
it
is
investigating
the
disappearance
of
the
journalist
who
was
critical
of
saudi
rulers
calling
for
reforms
trump
spoke
hours
after
receiving
an
update
from
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
on
the
results
of
pompeo
s
emergency
talks
in
saudi
arabia
and
turkey
this
week
in
the
new
york
times
interview
trump
also
expressed
confidence
in
intelligence
reports
that
suggest
a
saudi
role
in
the
suspected
killing
of
khashoggi
trump
said
however
it
was
still
a
little
bit
early
to
draw
definitive
conclusions
about
who
may
have
been
behind
it
pompeo
told
reporters
that
he
advised
trump
that
saudi
arabia
should
be
given
a
few
more
days
to
complete
its
investigation
into
the
disappearance
of
khashoggi
which
has
caused
an
international
outcry
and
strained
saudi
relations
with
western
countries
and
corporations
trump
said
he
was
waiting
for
the
results
so
that
we
can
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
very
soon
and
that
he
would
be
making
a
statement
about
it
at
some
point
asked
what
would
be
the
consequences
for
saudi
arabia
trump
said
well
it
ll
have
to
be
very
severe
i
mean
it
s
bad
bad
stuff
but
we
ll
see
what
the
united
states
considers
riyadh
a
linchpin
in
efforts
to
contain
iran
s
regional
influence
and
a
key
global
oil
source
and
trump
has
shown
no
inclination
to
mete
out
harsh
punishment
to
the
saudis
the
united
states
and
other
western
nations
are
in
a
dilemma
of
how
to
respond
because
of
lucrative
business
ties
including
weapons
sales
to
riyadh
referring
to
the
saudis
pompeo
said
he
told
trump
that
when
the
saudi
investigation
was
completed
we
can
make
decisions
about
how
or
if
the
united
states
should
respond
to
the
incident
surrounding
by
casting
doubt
on
whether
the
united
states
will
respond
at
all
pompeo
reflected
the
internal
struggle
among
trump
and
his
national
security
advisers
on
what
to
do
should
the
saudi
leadership
be
blamed
for
what
happened
to
khashoggi
i
think
it
s
important
for
us
all
to
remember
too
we
have
a
long
since
a
long
strategic
relationship
with
the
kingdom
of
saudi
arabia
pompeo
told
reporters
also
calling
saudi
arabia
an
important
counterterrorism
a
government
source
said
that
intelligence
agencies
are
increasingly
convinced
of
the
crown
prince
s
culpability
in
the
operation
against
khashoggi
which
they
believe
resulted
in
his
death
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
abandoned
plans
to
attend
an
investor
conference
in
riyadh
as
did
executives
from
goldman
sachs
group
putting
the
event
in
question
this
incident
is
unacceptable
and
clearly
they
have
to
answer
questions
specifically
regarding
this
incident
goldman
sachs
ceo
david
solomon
told
cnbc
earlier
on
thursday
senior
government
ministers
from
france
britain
and
the
netherlands
also
withdrew
from
the
riyadh
conference
joining
a
list
of
international
officials
and
business
executives
how
western
allies
deal
with
riyadh
will
hinge
on
the
extent
to
which
they
believe
responsibility
for
khashoggi
s
disappearance
lies
with
prince
mohammed
and
the
saudi
authorities
trump
previously
speculated
without
providing
evidence
that
rogue
killers
could
be
responsible
after
investigations
at
the
saudi
consulate
and
the
consul
s
residence
turkish
authorities
have
widened
the
geographic
focus
of
the
search
the
senior
turkish
officials
said
investigators
tracked
the
routes
and
stops
of
cars
that
left
those
two
places
on
the
officials
said
khashoggi
s
killers
may
have
dumped
his
remains
in
belgrad
forest
adjacent
to
istanbul
and
at
a
rural
location
near
the
city
of
yalova
a
mile
drive
south
of
istanbul
the
officials
said
the
investigations
led
to
some
suspicion
that
his
remains
may
be
in
the
city
of
yalova
and
the
belgrad
forest
police
have
been
searching
these
areas
one
of
the
officials
said
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
a
farm
house
or
villa
may
have
been
used
for
the
disposal
of
remains
the
official
said
the
sabah
newspaper
published
a
series
of
photos
of
a
man
it
identified
as
someone
who
travels
with
the
saudi
crown
prince
the
photos
showed
the
man
outside
the
saudi
consulate
building
in
istanbul
on
the
morning
khashoggi
disappeared
sabah
said
khashoggi
went
to
the
consulate
seeking
documents
for
his
planned
marriage
to
his
turkish
fiancee
who
was
waiting
outside
and
was
never
seen
again
