thousands
of
people
sporting
traditional
ethnic
costumes
and
karen
rebel
fighters
showing
off
their
guns
marched
sang
and
danced
last
week
to
celebrate
years
since
the
start
of
the
struggle
for
greater
autonomy
from
myanmar
boasting
more
than
soldiers
the
karen
national
union
knu
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
and
of
the
country
s
myriad
militia
groups
that
have
fought
the
government
since
shortly
after
myanmar
gained
independence
in
the
knu
s
parade
served
as
a
reminder
that
the
biggest
priority
of
the
aung
san
suu
kyi
s
administration
ending
decades
of
ethnic
wars
remains
elusive
suu
kyi
has
struggled
to
make
progress
with
ethnic
minority
rebels
who
have
accused
her
government
of
a
approach
and
ignoring
their
grievances
and
aspirations
the
knu
celebrations
took
place
at
a
remote
base
in
the
mountains
straddling
the
border
the
history
of
the
revolution
for
years
is
a
very
rough
one
as
someone
who
has
been
involved
in
the
revolution
for
years
i
can
say
it
s
very
tough
and
the
sacrifices
were
very
big
man
nyein
maung
one
of
the
knu
s
executive
members
told
the
irrawaddy
online
news
magazine
the
celebrations
lasted
several
days
and
nights
with
a
folk
dance
competition
and
theatre
performances
before
a
military
parade
and
speeches
on
a
dusty
parade
ground
carved
from
the
hills
at
the
crack
of
dawn
a
banner
hoisted
above
the
grounds
listed
some
of
the
group
s
political
demands
including
calls
to
retain
our
arms
and
to
decide
our
own
political
destiny
one
of
the
dance
groups
was
made
up
of
women
wearing
yellow
scarves
with
their
hair
tied
in
a
bun
and
an
exposed
fringe
their
yellow
shirts
with
green
patterns
contrasted
with
their
white
face
powder
and
red
lipstick
the
performers
mingled
with
villagers
and
soldiers
of
the
karen
national
liberation
army
the
knu
s
armed
wing
the
men
smoked
cigarettes
as
they
watched
some
with
heavy
bullet
belts
draped
around
automatic
rifles
and
with
insignia
in
red
white
and
blue
displayed
on
their
uniforms
the
knu
signed
a
ceasefire
with
the
government
in
after
more
than
six
decades
of
conflict
that
had
driven
tens
of
thousands
of
refugees
into
thailand
some
have
come
back
although
about
remain
in
the
refugee
camps
on
the
other
side
of
the
border
according
to
the
united
nations
while
major
clashes
have
been
avoided
the
knu
s
relations
with
the
myanmar
army
remain
tense
suu
kyi
has
struggled
to
secure
peace
elsewhere
in
the
country
and
conflicts
in
the
north
and
the
west
have
intensified
in
recent
years
in
a
military
offensive
drove
out
rohingya
muslims
from
the
western
state
of
rakhine
to
bangladesh
creating
one
of
the
world
s
largest
refugee
crises
