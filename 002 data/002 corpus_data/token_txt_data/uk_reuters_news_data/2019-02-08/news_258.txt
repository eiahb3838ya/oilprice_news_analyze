may says if brexit deal is rejected, uk will be in uncharted territory
london
reuters
prime
minister
theresa
may
said
on
sunday
that
britain
would
be
in
uncharted
territory
if
her
brexit
deal
is
rejected
by
parliament
later
this
month
despite
little
sign
that
she
has
won
over
sceptical
lawmakers
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
on
march
but
may
s
inability
so
far
to
get
her
deal
for
a
managed
exit
through
parliament
has
alarmed
business
leaders
and
investors
who
fear
the
country
is
heading
for
a
damaging
brexit
may
said
the
vote
in
parliament
would
be
around
as
expected
contrary
to
reports
she
could
delay
it
may
has
already
delayed
the
vote
once
in
december
when
it
became
clear
she
would
lose
unless
extra
reassurances
from
the
eu
were
agreed
describing
what
would
happen
if
she
was
defeated
may
told
the
bbc
we
re
going
to
be
in
uncharted
territory
i
don
t
think
anybody
can
say
exactly
what
will
happen
in
terms
of
the
reaction
we
ll
see
in
amid
the
uncertainty
over
britain
s
next
steps
which
range
from
leaving
without
a
deal
to
not
leaving
at
all
a
poll
showed
more
britons
want
to
remain
a
member
of
the
eu
than
leave
and
voters
want
to
make
the
final
decision
themselves
may
s
party
itself
is
divided
over
her
deal
with
many
fearing
that
an
insurance
policy
designed
to
avoid
the
of
a
hard
border
between
ireland
and
northern
ireland
could
leave
britain
subject
to
eu
rules
indefinitely
one
of
those
leading
that
opposition
lawmaker
jacob
said
in
a
newspaper
article
that
it
was
wishful
thinking
that
time
away
from
parliament
over
the
christmas
holiday
could
persuade
him
to
change
his
mind
and
back
the
deal
the
northern
irish
party
that
props
up
may
s
minority
government
called
on
her
to
stand
firm
in
demanding
that
the
eu
changes
its
poison
backstop
provision
on
ireland
s
border
with
the
parliamentary
debate
on
her
deal
due
to
begin
on
may
said
there
was
still
work
to
do
to
get
reassurances
over
the
backstop
from
the
eu
she
also
promised
parliament
would
have
a
greater
say
in
the
rest
of
the
brexit
process
and
warned
that
rejecting
her
deal
could
prevent
britain
s
exit
don
t
let
the
search
for
the
perfect
become
the
enemy
of
the
good
because
the
danger
there
is
actually
we
end
up
with
no
brexit
at
all
may
said
she
did
not
answer
whether
she
would
if
defeated
make
a
second
attempt
to
get
the
deal
passed
by
parliament
may
also
did
not
directly
respond
when
asked
if
she
was
leading
the
country
toward
a
brexit
on
tuesday
her
government
could
face
a
bid
to
block
an
unmanaged
exit
when
a
group
of
lawmakers
try
to
amend
budget
legislation
to
deny
funding
for
some
preparations
unless
they
are
approved
by
parliament
it
is
unclear
yet
whether
the
amendment
has
enough
support
to
pass
may
repeated
her
objections
to
holding
a
fresh
public
vote
on
the
deal
she
said
a
second
referendum
would
be
divisive
and
also
highlighted
the
lack
of
time
available
to
hold
a
new
referendum
practically
actually
you
couldn
t
get
a
referendum
in
time
before
the
of
march
you
d
be
talking
about
extending
