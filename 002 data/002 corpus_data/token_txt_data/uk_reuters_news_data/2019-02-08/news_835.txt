brussels
reuters
european
council
president
donald
tusk
on
tuesday
bemoaned
the
lack
of
leaders
great
enough
to
overcome
a
deadlock
on
the
irish
border
in
brexit
talks
which
he
compared
to
the
gordian
knot
unravelled
by
alexander
the
great
casting
gloom
on
the
state
of
play
ahead
of
a
summit
of
eu
leaders
this
week
tusk
said
he
wished
for
a
leader
of
the
likes
of
the
macedonian
king
fabled
to
have
solved
the
riddle
of
the
gordian
knot
by
slicing
through
it
with
one
stroke
of
his
sword
it
looks
like
a
new
version
of
the
gordian
knot
tusk
said
of
an
impasse
over
how
to
ensure
there
is
no
return
to
a
hard
border
between
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
and
ireland
unfortunately
i
can
t
see
a
new
version
of
alexander
the
great
he
quipped
it
s
not
so
easy
to
find
this
kind
of
creative
with
less
than
six
months
to
go
before
britain
s
departure
he
said
he
hoped
prime
minister
theresa
may
would
present
something
creative
enough
to
solve
the
impasse
at
the
leaders
summit
but
added
there
was
not
much
grounds
for
optimism
asked
whether
may
s
former
foreign
minister
boris
johnson
might
have
the
mettle
to
find
a
solution
tusk
said
such
claims
may
be
exaggerated
