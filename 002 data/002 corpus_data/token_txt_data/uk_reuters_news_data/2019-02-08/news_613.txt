a
draft
divorce
deal
with
the
european
union
after
more
than
a
year
of
talks
thrusting
prime
minister
theresa
may
into
a
perilous
battle
over
brexit
that
could
shape
her
country
s
prosperity
for
generations
to
come
while
brussels
choreographs
the
first
withdrawal
of
a
sovereign
state
from
the

a
far
from
secure
leader
hemmed
in
by
opponents
in
government
and
her
own
conservative
party
must
now
try
to
get
the
deal
approved
by
her
cabinet

in
the
toughest
test
of
all
by
parliament
brexiteers
in
may
s
party
accused
her
of
surrendering
to
the
eu
and
said
they
would
vote
the
deal
down
while
the
northern
irish
party
which
props
up
her
minority
government
questioned
whether
she
would
be
able
to
get
parliamentary
approval
these
are
momentous
days
and
the
decisions
being
taken
will
have
ramifications
said
arlene
foster
leader
of
the
northern
irish
democratic
unionist
party
dup
which
keeps
the
government

a
downing
street
spokesman
said
after
irish
and
british
media
were
leaked
details
of
the
agreement
on
the
text
sterling
which
has
seesawed
since
reaching
just
before
britain
s
referendum
that
saw
a
percent
margin
for
leaving
the
eu
surged
on
news
of
a
deal
but
then
erased
some
gains
as
opponents
lined
up
to
criticise
may
brexit
will
pitch
the
world
s
fifth
largest
economy
into
the
unknown
and
many
fear
it
will
serve
to
divide
the
west
as
it
grapples
with
both
the
unconventional
presidency
of
donald
trump
and
growing
assertiveness
from
russia
and
china
supporters
of
brexit
say
that
while
the
divorce
might
bring
some
instability
in
the
longer
term
it
will
allow
the
united
kingdom
to
thrive
and
also
enable
deeper
eu
integration
without
such
a
powerful
reluctant
member
a
senior
eu
official
confirmed
that
a
draft
text
had
been
agreed
eu
leaders
could
meet
on
for
a
summit
to
seal
the
brexit
deal
if
may
s
cabinet
approves
the
text
diplomatic
sources
said
the
eu
and
britain
need
an
agreement
to
keep
trade
flowing
between
the
world
s
biggest
trading
bloc
and
the
united
kingdom
home
to
the
biggest
international
financial
centre
but
may
an
initial
opponent
of
brexit
who
won
the
top
job
in
the
turmoil
that
followed
the
referendum
has
struggled
to
untangle
nearly
years
of
eu
membership
without
damaging
commerce
or
upsetting
the
mps
who
will
ultimately
decide
the
fate
of
the
divorce
accord
by
seeking
to
leave
the
eu
while
preserving
the
closest
possible
ties
may
s
compromise
plan
has
upset
brexiteers
scottish
nationalists
the
northern
irish
party
that
props
up
her
government
and
some
of
her
own
ministers
it
is
unclear
when
parliament
might
vote
on
a
deal
to
get
the
deal
approved
she
needs
the
votes
of
about
mps
in
the
parliament
she
faces
a
deeply
divided
government
party
parliament
and
country
prominent
brexiteers
such
as
conservative
lawmaker
jacob
and
former
foreign
secretary
boris
johnson
said
may
had
sold
out
the
united
kingdom
and
that
they
would
oppose
it
it
is
a
failure
of
the
government
s
negotiating
position
it
is
a
failure
to
deliver
on
brexit
and
it
is
potentially
dividing
up
the
united
kingdom
conservative
lawmaker
jacob
said
the
opposition
labour
party
which
has
said
it
would
oppose
any
agreement
that
does
not
retain
the
exact
same
economic
benefits
that
it
now
has
with
the
eu
said
it
was
unlikely
the
announced
deal
was
right
for
britain
it
is
vassal
state
stuff
johnson
said
adding
that
he
would
vote
against
such
an
unacceptable
accord

calling
for
another

to
avoid
her
brexit
plans
unleashing
britain
s
greatest
crisis
since
world
war
two
may
formally
began
britain
s
divorce
in
march
ushering
in
tortuous
negotiations
on
everything
from
space
exploration
and
fishing
territories
to
selling
complex
financial
products
and
the
future
of
the
land
border
on
the
island
of
ireland
as
deadlines
passed
officials
such
as
britain
s
olly
robbins
and
the
commission

a
german
raced
to
get
a
deal
in
late
night
sessions
at
the
european
commission
s
modernist
berlaymont
building
in
brussels
with
less
than
five
months
until
britain
leaves
the
eu
the
northern
irish
backstop
was
the
main
sticking
point
the
backstop
is
an
insurance
policy
to
avoid
a
return
to
controls
on
the
border
between
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
and
eu
member
state
ireland
if
a
future
trading
relationship
is
not
agreed
in
time
the
british
government
supplied
no
immediate
details
on
the
brexit
deal
text
which
runs
to
hundreds
of
pages
three
eu
sources
said
the
backstop
would
come
in
the
form
of
a
customs
arrangement
with
specific
provisions
for
northern
ireland
which
go
deeper
on
the
issue
of
customs
and
alignment
with
the
rules
of
the
eu
single
market
than
for
the
rest
of
the
united
kingdom
it
would
include
a
review
mechanism
to
bridge
between
eu
demands
that
the
insurance
policy
is
permanently
available
and
britain
s
request
to
avoid
being
held
in
a
customs
alliance
with
the
bloc
perpetually
the
dup
has
ruled
out
any
deal
that
treats
northern
ireland
differently
