to
billion
in
suspicious

or
nearly
of
the

danske
bank
s

was
one
of
the
lenders
clearing
dollar
transactions
for
danske
s
estonian
branch
a
deutsche
bank
spokesman
confirmed
in
a
statement
to
reuters
the
lender
acted
as
a
correspondent
bank
for
danske
in
estonia
our
role
was
to
process
payments
for
danske
bank
we
terminated
the
relationship
in
after
identifying
suspicious
activity
the
spokesman
said
wilkinson
said
two
banks
were
also
involved
in
handling
dollar
payments
for
danske
in
estonia
without
identifying
them
alongside
deutsche
jpmorgan
and
bank
of
america
cleared
dollar
transactions
for
danske
s
estonian
branch
sources
have
told
reuters
jpmorgan
ended
the
correspondent
banking
relationship
with
danske
in
on
grounds
that
transactions
did
not
comply
with
laundering
rules
according
to
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
bank
of
america
declined
to
comment
authorities
in
denmark
estonia
britain
and
the
united
states
are
investigating
payments
totalling
billion
euros
billion
made
through
danske
bank
s
tiny
estonian
branch
between
and
in
a
growing
global
scandal
i
would
guess
that
billion
went
through
this
particular
bank
the
large
european
bank
in
the
the
briton
told
a
danish
parliamentary
hearing
no
one
really
knows
where
this
money
went
all
we
know
is
that
the
last
people
to
see
it
was
these
three
large
banks
in
the
they
were
the
last
check
and
when
that
failed
the
money
was
into
the
global
financial
system
wilkinson
said
interim
ceo
jesper
nielsen
said
the
affair
had
tarnished
the
reputation
of
danske
bank
we
have
breached
the
expectations
society
had
of
us
the
case
and
the
course
of
events
around
it
does
not
reflect
the
bank
we
want
to
be
nielsen
told
the
danish
lawmakers
after
wilkinson
s
testimony
wilkinson
said
that
he
had
been
offered
cash
by
danske
bank
not
to
speak
out
but
had
got
a
waiver
last
month
allowing
him
to
talk
to
some
authorities
adding
that
he
did
not
expect
investigations
into
the
dirty
money
to
bear
fruit
there
is
no
chance
in
the
world
that
any
of
that
money
is
ever
going
to
be
tracked
down
and
that
any
criminals
lose
a
single
cent
he
said
danske
bank
has
acknowledged
that
its
money
laundering
controls
in
estonia
were
insufficient
but
in
a
report
issued
in
september
said
its
board
chairman
and
chief
executive
had
not
breached
their
legal
obligations
in
april
it
became
clear
that
the
bank
didn
t
intend
to
do
anything
the
former
danske
bank
employee
said
referring
to
earlier
whistleblower
reports
there
was
a
curious
lack
of
interest
at
senior
management
wilkinson
said
that
at
the
start
of
january
he
had
looked
at
the
three
most
profitable
accounts
involving
british
limited
liability
partnerships
llps
they
were
all
fake
not
just
that
they
all
basically
looked
the
same
and
it
turned
out
they
all
had
the
same
registered
office
in
a
suburb
in
north
london
i
passed
those
on
by
april
none
of
the
accounts
had
been
closed
i
warned
them
danske
that
if
they
didn
t
do
a
proper
investigation
and
make
the
appropriate
report
to
the
police
then
i
was
going
to
do
it
myself
wilkinson
said
in
september
this
year
danske
bank
said
the
first
whistleblower
report
which
was
titled
whistleblowing
disclosure
knowingly
dealing
with
criminals
in
estonia
branch
was
sent
to
its
executive
board
group
compliance
and
internal
auditor
at
the
end
of
december
however
the
bank
s
report
concluded
that
no
red
flags
were
shared
with
thomas
borgen
when
he
held
ultimate
executive
responsibility
for
estonia
from
to
borgen
stepped
down
as
ceo
following
the
september
report
saying
that
although
he
was
cleared
from
a
legal
point
of
view
he
held
the
ultimate
responsibility
the
scandal
has
emerged
at
the
same
time
as
a
major
government
tax
scandal
and
a
fraud
case
in
the
danish
ministry
for
social
affairs
undermining
confidence
in
once
trusted
institutions
and
sparking
calls
for
action
from
lawmakers
wilkinson
said
that
denmark
s
fsa
financial
regulator
which
was
not
immediately
available
for
comment
did
not
contact
him
before
issuing
a
report
on
the
allegations
in
may
and
called
for
danish
authorities
to
investigate
the
fsa
s
role
if
howard
wilkinson
is
correct
in
that
he
can
t
talk
to
the
danish
authorities
without
being
prosecuted
that
must
obviously
be
changed
authorities
should
investigate
the
case
thoroughly
and
they
can
only
do
that
if
they
can
get
the
information
danish
business
minister
rasmus
jarlov
said
on
twitter
the
fsa
said
in
may
it
had
not
found
sufficient
basis
for
launching
cases
against
members
of
danske
bank
s
management
