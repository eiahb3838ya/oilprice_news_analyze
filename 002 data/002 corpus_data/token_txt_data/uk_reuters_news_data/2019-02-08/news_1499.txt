saying
they
were
confident

would
win
regulatory
and
shareholder
approvals
while
launching
embraer
into
new
markets
i
can
t
anticipate
that
anyone

the

a

giving

a
controlling
stake
in
embraer
s
commercial
aircraft
arm
the
alliance
following

of

aerospace
market
in

strengthening
established

newcomers
from
china
russia
and
japan
analysts
say
the
new
company
thrusts
boeing
into
the
lower
end
of
the
market
giving
stiffer
competition
to
the
cseries
jets
now
rebranded
as
the
designed
by
canada
s
bombardier
inc
which
are
backed
by
european
rival
airbus
se
the
deal
must
still
clear
political
and
regulatory
barriers
before
closing
as
proposed
at
the
end
of
next
year
the
partnership
which
adds
a
to
family
to
boeing
s
lineup
is
expected
to
boost
the
firm
s
earnings
per
share
from
generating
annual
cost
savings
of
about
million
by
the
third
year
the
companies
said
boeing
ceo
dennis

the
defining
moments
in
boeing
s
long
history
in
aerospace
in

to
the
passenger
jet
deal
boeing
and
embraer
will
deepen
a
sales
and
services
partnership
on
the
new
military
cargo
jet
through
a
separate
defence
venture
that
is
likely
to
eventually
receive
a
joint
investment
the
companies
told
reporters
they
would
collaborate
on
or
modifications
to
the
platform
as
well
as
mutual
agreements
for
managing
the
supply
chain
on
the
military
and
commercial
side
while
giving
embraer
access
to
more
markets
the
deal
will
allow
the
companies
to
go
to
customers
with
combinations
of
fleet
services
between
