russia
voiced
support
for
saudi
arabia
in
its
worsening
row
with
canada
on
wednesday
telling
ottawa
it
was
unacceptable
to
lecture
the
kingdom
on
human
rights
saudi
arabia
froze
new
trade
and
investment
with
canada
and
expelled
the
canadian
ambassador
this
week
in
a
retaliatory
move
after
canada
publicly
called
for
the
release
of
arrested
human
rights
activists
russian
foreign
ministry
spokeswoman
maria
zakharova
said
that
human
rights
should
be
promoted
with
respect
for
specific
national
customs
and
traditions
we
have
always
said
that
the
politicization
of
human
rights
matters
is
unacceptable
zakharova
said
what
one
probably
needs
in
this
situation
is
constructive
advice
and
assistance
rather
than
criticism
from
a
moral
superior
