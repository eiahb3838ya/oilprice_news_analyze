donald
trump
faced
outrage
on
tuesday
for
his
failure
to
hold
russia
accountable
for
meddling
in
the
election
and
some
lawmakers
threatened
action
in
congress
to
punish
moscow
and
show
support
for
intelligence
agencies
at
a
joint
news
conference
with
russian
president
vladimir
putin
after
a
summit
in
helsinki
on
monday
trump
stunned
politicians
back
home
by
shying
away
from
criticizing
putin
for
moscow
s
efforts
to
undermine
the
election
contradicting
the
findings
of
american
intelligence
agencies
trump
whose
summit
with
putin
concluded
a
europe
trip
that
included
a
nato
meeting
and
talks
with
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
pushed
back
on
tuesday
at
the
storm
of
criticism
blaming
media
coverage
while
i
had
a
great
meeting
with
nato
raising
vast
amounts
of
money
i
had
an
even
better
meeting
with
vladimir
putin
of
russia
sadly
it
is
not
being
reported
that
way
the
fake
news
is
going
crazy
he
tweeted
the
condemnation
for
his
performance
at
the
helsinki
news
conference
including
from
many
fellow
republicans
matched
or
eclipsed
previous
controversies
in
trump
s
turbulent
months
in
office
the
president
needs
to
understand
he
has
damaged
foreign
policy
representative
mike
turner
a
republican
on
the
house
intelligence
committee
told
cnn
he
s
given
them
a
pass
and
is
certainly
not
holding
them
accountable
for
what
they
re
some
lawmakers
said
they
would
seek
remedies
in
congress
republican
senator
jeff
flake
a
longtime
trump
critic
has
raised
the
idea
of
passing
a
resolution
that
would
voice
lawmakers
support
for
the
intelligence
community
and
allies
many
of
who
are
feeling
the
sting
of
strong
trump
criticism
in
recent
weeks
robert
menendez
the
top
democrat
on
the
senate
foreign
relations
panel
has
floated
a
resolution
similar
to

sasse
republican
pat
toomey
senate
democratic
leader
chuck
schumer
and
mark
warner
the
senior
democrat
on
the
senate
intelligence
panel
have
backed
more
sanctions
on
russia
but
it
was
unclear
whether
senate
or
house
of
representatives
leaders
would
support
such
a
move
or
how
new
sanctions
might
be
crafted
house
speaker

ryan
calling
russia
s
government
menacing
said
he
was
willing
to
consider
additional
sanctions
on
russia
and
reiterated
his
support
for
intelligence
community
findings
that
russia
interfered
in
the
election
congress
nearly
unanimously
passed
a
sanctions
law
last
year
targeting
moscow
for
election
meddling
and
for
its
actions
in
ukraine
and
syria
in
april
that
law
led
the
treasury
to
impose
major
sanctions
on
russian
officials
and
oligarchs
in
one
of
washington
s
most
aggressive
moves
to
punish
moscow

also
called
for
the
immediate
passage
of
legislation

senate
to
hold
immediate
hearings
to
get
testimony
from
trump
s
national
security
team
about
what
transpired

what
the
heck
happened

last
year
that
the
russian
government
interfered
in
the
election
campaign
and
sought
to
tilt
the

in
trump
s
favour
something
moscow
has
long
denied
special
counsel
robert
mueller
is
probing
that
allegation
and
any
possible
collusion
by
trump

campaign
trump
has
denied
collusion

casts
mueller

probe
as
a
witchhunt
that
detracts
from
his
election
victory
