on
her
deal
in

first
seeking
assurances

over
the

an
insurance
policy
to
avoid
a
hard
border
between
the
british

party
dup
leader
arlene
foster
reiterated
that
her
party
required
changes
to
the
actual
withdrawal
agreement
but
said
they
would
work
with
the
government
to
achieve
a
better
deal
for
our
part
we
want
to
leave
with
a
sensible
deal
which
works
for
the
united
kingdom
northern
ireland
in
particular
but
also
our
neighbours
in
the
republic
of
ireland
we
want
an
orderly
exit
which
implements
the
referendum
result
foster
said
in
a
statement
we
have
been
consistent
throughout
the
negotiations
that
great
britain
is
northern
ireland
s
main
market
therefore
any
deal
which
will
undermine
the
economic
or
constitutional
integrity
of
the
united
kingdom
single
market
will
not
have
dup
northern
irish
business
groups
have
overwhelmingly
come
out
in
favour
of
may
s
draft
agreement
including
the
contentious
backstop
foster
said
the
dup
was
mindful
of
people
in
all
sectors
who
she
said
were
frustrated
with
the
pace
of
negotiations
and
the
lack
of
certainty
we
share
the
frustration
as
politicians
we
have
a
duty
to
look
to
the
impact
of
any
deal
on
our
core
industries
that
s
where
our
energies
will
be
focused
in
the
coming
days
