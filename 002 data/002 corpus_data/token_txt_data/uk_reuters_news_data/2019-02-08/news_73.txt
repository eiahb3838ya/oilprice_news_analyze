factbox - brexit: what happens next?
london
reuters
britain
s
parliament
has
demanded
that
prime
minister
theresa
may
renegotiate
a
brexit
divorce
deal
that
the
other
members
of
the
european
union
say
they
will
not
reopen
less
than
two
months
until
the
united
kingdom
is
due
by
law
to
leave
the
eu
the
options
include
a
disorderly
brexit
a
delay
to
brexit
or
no
brexit
at
all
below
is
a
summary
of
what
is
due
to
happen
next
opposition
labour
leader
jeremy
corbyn
who
had
refused
to
hold
talks
on
brexit
with
may
said
after
the
vote
on
tuesday
night
that
he
was
now
prepared
to
meet
with
her
that
meeting
is
due
to
take
place
at
gmt
on
wednesday
with
a
source
in
his
party
saying
corbyn
would
tell
may
a
exit
must
be
taken
off
the
table
and
she
should
pursue
his
party
s
alternative
plan
for
brexit
may
s
conservatives
do
not
have
a
majority
in
parliament
and
many
of
her
own
mps
and
the
small
northern
irish
party
which
props
up
her
government
oppose
her
deal
as
it
stands
so
winning
the
support
of
labour
would
help
ensure
she
can
get
it
through
parliament
the
meeting
is
not
expected
to
result
in
a
breakthrough
on
tuesday
mps
backed
a
symbolic
call
on
the
government
to
stop
a
potentially
disorderly
exit
sending
a
signal
that
most
oppose
such
a
departure
it
does
not
bind
the
government
but
may
said
she
would
talk
to
mps
to
discuss
how
that
outcome
could
be
prevented
by
securing
a
deal
which
parliament
could
support
may
also
said
she
would
engage
seriously
with
a
compromise
plan
put
forward
by
conservative
mps
which
seeks
to
draw
a
line
under
internal
divisions
that
have
so
far
prevented
parliament
approving
a
deal
it
courts
brexiteers
with
a
promise
to
ditch
an
unpopular
irish
border
policy
in
favour
of
an
alternative
and
appeals
to
conservatives
by
pledging
safeguards
against
the
risk
of
disruption
if
no
deal
can
be
agreed
with
the
eu
may
has
said
she
will
speak
to
the
eu
to
seek
the
changes
demanded
by
parliament
but
she
has
no
confirmed
plans
to
travel
to
brussels
yet
ambassadors
are
due
to
meet
on
wednesday
to
discuss
brexit
and
may
will
speak
to
european
council
president
donald
tusk
by
phone
at
gmt
on
wednesday
on
tuesday
tusk
said
the
divorce
deal
was
not
up
for
renegotiation
may
will
also
speak
to
irish
prime
minister
leo
varadkar
later
on
wednesday
may
said
the
government
would
bring
a
revised
deal
back
to
parliament
for
a
vote
as
soon
as
possible
before
the
previous
vote
parliament
held
five
days
of
debate
but
it
is
not
clear
whether
there
would
be
another
lengthy
debate
before
any
subsequent
vote
may
said
that
if
she
did
not
bring
a
deal
back
for
a
vote
by
she
would
make
a
statement
to
parliament
and
put
forward
a
motion
for
debate
on
mps
will
be
able
to
put
propose
amendments
to
that
motion
an
attempt
by
labour
lawmaker
yvette
cooper
and
conservative
nick
boles
to
give
parliament
the
power
to
request
a
delay
to
britain
s
march
exit
was
defeated
by
mps
on
tuesday
but
boles
said
he
would
renew
that
effort
on
if
a
deal
has
not
been
passed
by
then
we
remain
committed
to
ensuring
that
we
don
t
reach
the
cliff
edge
on
march
without
a
deal
boles
and
cooper
said
in
a
statement
on
tuesday
may
also
said
that
if
she
brings
a
deal
back
for
a
vote
and
it
is
rejected
she
will
put
forward
a
motion
the
following
day
which
mps
will
be
able
to
propose
amendments
to
all
eu
leaders
are
due
to
meet
in
brussels
on
march
this
could
be
an
opportunity
for
an
deal
or
it
would
be
the
last
chance
to
agree
an
extension
of
the
article
negotiation
period
and
delay
brexit
to
avoid
disruptions
if
may
does
not
get
a
deal
approved
by
parliament
by
march
britain
faces
a
disorderly
exit
or
may
be
forced
to
seek
an
extension
of
article
to
give
more
time
to
reach
an
agreement
it
is
not
certain
the
eu
would
agree
to
this
some
mps
including
labour
leader
corbyn
have
said
it
is
now
inevitable
that
the
government
will
have
to
seek
an
extension
regardless
as
there
will
not
be
enough
time
to
pass
the
necessary
legislation
for
britain
s
exit
before
march
last
week
the
leader
of
britain
s
lower
house
of
parliament
andrea
leadsom
said
the
date
might
need
to
be
pushed
back
by
a
couple
of
weeks
the
bloc
will
vote
to
elect
a
new
european
parliament
on
may
the
new
chamber
would
sit
from
july
a
date
that
is
shaping
up
to
be
the
eu
s
limit
for
any
extension
of
article
the
eu
says
britain
would
have
to
organise
european
parliament
elections
on
its
soil
if
it
were
to
delay
brexit
beyond
that
as
otherwise
its
people
would
be
deprived
of
their
democratic
representation
while
still
being
in
the
eu
the
bloc
fears
britain
would
not
do
that
some
in
the
eu
also
fear
that
should
britain
vote
it
would
elect
a
staunchly
eurosceptic
representation
to
the
european
parliament
that
is
already
expected
to
have
a
larger
contingent
of
eu
critics
influencing
the
bloc
s
policies
