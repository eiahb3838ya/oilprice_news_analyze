liverpool

reuters
britain
s
opposition
labour
party
will
vote
this
week
to
keep
a
second
brexit
referendum
as
an
option
if
theresa
may
fails
to
pass
her
plan
to
quit
the
european
union
through
parliament
heaping
pressure
on
a
struggling
prime
minister
but
with
the
leadership
intent
on
any
such
referendum
not
allowing
a
of
a
vote
to
stay
or
leave
the
eu
the
move
could
reignite
tensions
in
the
party
which
like
much
of
britain
is
divided
over
how
to
quit
the
bloc
after
may
s
plans
for
brexit
the
biggest
shift
in
british
policy
for
more
than
four
decades
were
rebuffed
by
the
eu
on
thursday
the
outcome
of
talks
to
leave
are
more
uncertain
than
ever
and
have
boosted
those
who
want
to
stop
the
divorce
labour
leader
jeremy
corbyn
has
been
reluctant
to
support
growing
demands
for
a
second
referendum
or
people
s
vote
but
the
party
agreed
a
motion
after
five
hours
that
went
some
way
to
appeasing
members
who
want
another
chance
to
vote
on
brexit
labour
agreed
late
on
sunday
night
the
party
would
vote
on
tuesday
on
a
motion
committing
the
party
to
support
all
options
remaining
on
the
table
including
campaigning
for
a
public
vote
if
no
election
is
triggered
by
may
s
brexit
plans
for
corbyn
s
backers
the
motion
does
little
to
change
his
position
that
labour
prefers
a
new
national
election
to
a
second
vote
which
will
ask
a
different
question
from
the
one
posed
at
the
referendum
in
which
the
leave
campaign
beat
remain
by
percent
to
percent
corbyn
s
second
in
command
finance
spokesman
john
mcdonnell
repeated
that
labour
was
ready
for
an
election
which
he
said
was
the
best
solution
and
that
any
new
vote
would
not
be
a
repeat
of
the
referendum
to
stay
or
leave
the
bloc
the
labour
party
says
the
motion
is
not
prescriptive
on
what
the
question
of
any
second
referendum
should
be
leaving
options
open
to
gauge
the
lie
of
the
land
if
or
when
such
a
vote
needs
to
take
place
a
source
in
the
campaign
for
a
people
s
vote
cautiously
welcomed
the
move
saying
we
feel
it
s
moved
in
the
right
it
s
always
going
to
be
babysteps
rather
than
a
giant
leap
but
it
s
an
important
in
the
opposing
corner
brendan
chilton
of
labour
leave
told
reuters
there
are
million
labour
leavers
in
the
country
who
will
look
upon
this
motion
with
britain
is
to
exit
the
eu
in
march
next
year
after
months
of
talks
that
have
again
exposed
the
deep
divisions
in
both
the
country
s
main
parties
the
conservatives
are
all
but
at
war
with
each
other
and
labour
is
also
at
odds
over
how
to
leave
the
country
s
path
out
of
the
bloc
is
even
more
unclear
after
weeks
of
positive
noises
about
the
prospects
of
clinching
a
divorce
deal
and
one
on
a
future
trading
relationship
the
mood
between
britain
and
the
eu
turned
sour
on
thursday
brexit
minister
dominic
raab
again
said
he
was
confident
of
clinching
a
deal
with
the
eu
calling
the
summit
in
austria
last
week
just
one
of
several
blips
in
the
world
they
re
blown
a
little
bit
out
of
proportion
but
we
double
down
we
don
t
throw
our
toys
out
the
pram
hold
our
nerve
keep
our
cool
raab
said
but
the
summit
in
salzburg
seemed
to
increase
the
possibility
of
britain
leaving
without
a
deal
which
could
hurt
the
economy
and
sever
trade
flows
and
spurred
those
who
want
another
referendum
to
try
to
overturn
the
vote
may
has
ruled
out
a
second
referendum
and
eu
officials
say
they
would
not
want
to
see
a
of
the
vote
prolonging
uncertainty
that
has
already
forced
companies
to
stop
taking
investment
decisions
and
with
talk
of
a
new
election
swirling
may
s
conservative
party
was
keen
to
target
corbyn
over
his
move
to
back
a
second
referendum
jeremy
corbyn
this
morning
proved
he
is
not
fit
to
govern
our
country
brandon
lewis
the
party
s
chairman
said
on
sunday
he
confirmed
labour
would
take
us
back
to
square
