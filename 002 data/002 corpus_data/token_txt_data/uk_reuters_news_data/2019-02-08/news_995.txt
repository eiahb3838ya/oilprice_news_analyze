comcast demonstrates sky-high ambition in global media shake-up
york
reuters
cable
giant
comcast
scored
a
big
win
in
the
scramble
for
media
assets
by
beating
rupert
murdoch
and
his
backer
disney
in
the
battle
for
sky
with
an
billion
bid
it
was
a
great
day
for
comcast
chairman
and
chief
executive
brian
roberts
said
of
saturday
s
auction
victory
the
group
has
had
its
sights
set
on
sky
europe
s
biggest
company
ever
since
walt
disney
co
beat
it
to
most
of
murdoch
s
century
fox
assets
in
july
some
analysts
however
said
that
comcast
s
bid
of
pounds
per
share
in
the
rare
blind
auction
was
driven
by
an
urgent
need
to
build
scale
to
defend
against
the
threat
posed
by
streaming
services
netflix
and
amazon
the
price
being
paid
for
sky
is
shocking
but
it
is
a
clear
sign
that
legacy
media
companies
are
desperate
for
scale
in
a
world
dominated
by
tech
platform
giants
said
richard
greenfield
technology
and
media
analyst
at
research
firm
btig
explaining
the
basis
of
big
media
s
rush
to
merge
greenfield
likened
it
to
the
opening
scene
in
the
documentary
march
of
the
penguins
the
penguins
huddle
to
survive
winter
with
and
it
s
penguins
huddling
winter
is
still
coming
he
said
referring
to
the
advance
of
tech
players
such
as
amazon
sky
would
reduce
comcast
s
reliance
on
its
mature
market
by
opening
the
door
to
europe
where
penetration
is
at
about
percent
and
rising
the
deal
would
also
transform
comcast
into
the
world
s
largest
operator
with
million
customers
and
lift
the
proportion
of
its
revenue
to
about
percent
from
about
percent
based
on
figures
comcast
is
paying
a
high
price
more
than
double
sky
s
share
price
before
fox
made
its
approach
in
december
but
analysts
said
that
a
favorable
result
in
the
english
premier
league
soccer
rights
auction
sky
s
biggest
expense
during
the
takeover
saga
had
made
the
business
more
valuable
sky
also
gives
comcast
an
immediate
beachhead
in
online
video
streaming
with
its
now
tv
business
which
has
about
million
customers
analysts
see
comcast
now
tv
to
combat
netflix
across
the
globe
and
sky
s
exclusive
relationships
to
distribute
hbo
entertainment
content
and
premier
league
soccer
further
insulate
comcast
over
the
next
few
years
critics
of
the
deal
however
argue
that
such
relationships
are
sure
to
come
under
threat
in
the
longer
term
as
content
producers
launch
their
own
services
and
competition
for
sports
broadcasting
rights
intensifies
as
tech
companies
join
the
fray
on
the
upside
however
sky
s
product
range
including
broadband
connections
that
complement
its
satellite
offer
in
platforms
such
as
sky
q
and
its
brand
make
it
more
than
a
content
aggregator
said
alice
enders
head
of
research
at
enders
analysis
sky
has
an
extraordinarily
well
established
brand
it
is
a
destination
and
that
is
very
valuable
in
the
world
of
fragmented
media
