french pm philippe: we have to be ready for "no-deal" brexit
paris
reuters
french
prime
minister
edouard
philippe
said
on
thursday
that
ongoing
political
uncertainty
in
britain
over
brexit
raised
concerns
about
whether
the
agreement
struck
with
brussels
to
leave
the
european
union
would
end
up
being
ratified
we
need
to
prepare
ourselves
for
the
possibility
of
a
brexit
philippe
said
during
a
visit
to
dunkirk
a
port
city
in
northern
france
where
locals
are
concerned
about
the
impact
of
brexit
on
business
and
trade
it
will
escape
no
one
that
the
current
political
situation
in
britain
could
fuel
uncertainty
over
the
ratification
of
the
accord
he
said
referring
to
the
resignation
of
several
british
ministers
over
the
deal
philippe
said
the
withdrawal
agreement
reached
between
britain
and
the
european
union
after
months
of
negotiation
was
a
step
forward
but
crucially
it
now
depends
on
ratification
by
britain
s
parliament
as
well
as
the
parliaments
of
the
european
union
and
the
other
eu
member
states
the
concern
in
britain
is
that
prime
minister
theresa
may
could
face
a
vote
given
the
growing
opposition
to
the
deal
within
her
conservative
party
if
she
were
forced
out
the
risk
of
a
brexit
would
greatly
increase
philippe
said
that
if
britain
were
to
leave
the
eu
without
a
deal
in
march
next
year
it
would
cause
very
serious
problems
for
france
especially
around
trade
across
the
channel
we
therefore
need
to
prepare
ourselves
for
the
eventuality
that
remains
on
the
table
one
that
i
must
say
very
clearly
we
do
not
wish
for
that
of
a
brexit
