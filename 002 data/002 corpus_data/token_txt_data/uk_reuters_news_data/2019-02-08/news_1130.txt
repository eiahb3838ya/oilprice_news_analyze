italy
s
government
on
thursday
moved
to
prevent
people
convicted
of
serious
corruption
from
ever
working
with
the
state
again
with
a
bill
it
says
will
save
billions
of
euros
the
bribe
destroyer
or
spazzacorrotti
bill
is
a
brainchild
of
the
movement
which
took
office
after
campaigning
against
the
rampant
corruption
that
has
characterised
italian
politics
in
the
past
has
governed
in
a
coalition
with
the
league
party
since
june
deputy
prime
minister
luigi
di
maio
who
is
also
leader
told
reporters
the
bill
would
save
the
state
billions
of
euros
he
did
not
specify
how
that
figure
had
been
calculated
justice
minister
alfonso
bonafede
also
member
hailed
the
bill
as
a
revolution
in
the
fight
against
corruption
after
the
cabinet
approved
it
this
is
the
first
in
a
series
of
measures
that
should
make
the
country
competitive
again
prime
minister
giuseppe
conte
said
the
bill
now
goes
to
parliament
the
coalition
has
a
majority
in
both
houses
but
italian
legislation
is
often
amended
by
deputies
before
becoming
law
under
the
government
s
draft
anyone
convicted
of
corruption
and
sentenced
to
more
than
two
years
in
prison
will
never
be
able
to
hold
public
office
or
seek
a
state
contract
again
bonafede
said
those
convicted
of
corruption
crimes
carrying
sentences
of
less
than
two
years
will
be
shut
out
of
public
business
for
five
to
seven
years
he
said
the
legislation
would
also
allow
undercover
agents
to
work
on
corruption
investigations
for
the
first
time
another
component
of
the
bill
is
that
it
will
require
full
transparency
on
private
and
corporate
contributions
to
political
parties
and
foundations
di
maio
said
this
will
allow
us
to
finally
understand
why
over
the
years
we
ve
seen
some
policy
choices
made
that
went
against
the
interests
of
citizens
