a fed tally - nearing normal, central bank won a few, and lost as well
washington

win
lose
or
draw
the
federal
reserve
has
begun
signalling
the
end
of
its
cycle
is
not
far
off
winding
down
its
sometimes
sisyphean
effort
to
restore
a
semblance
of
normalcy
to
monetary
policy
it
has
been
a
slow
slog
the
fed
has
managed
just
nine
increases
in
three
years
and
it
may
squeeze
in
just
a
couple
more
the
fed
has
picked
up
a
few
wins
along
the
way
but
it
also
notched
some
losses
and
draws
here
are
a
few
unemployment
the
percent
jobless
rate
at
a
low
is
arguably
the
fed
s
touchstone
achievement
of
the
crisis
era
sure
other
steps
helped
along
the
way
including
the
republican
tax
cut
and
spending
boost
from
the
trump
administration
but
the
historic
run
of
job
growth
has
gone
on
longer
than
even
the
fed
expected
so
score
one
for
the
central
bank
lower
for
longer
strategy
of
keeping
rates
pinned
down
its
steady
guidance
that
any
increases
would
be
ploddingly
slow
and
arguably
its
massive
balance
sheet
that
anchored
home
mortgage
and
other
important
rates
balance
sheet
at
its
peak
the
fed
s
stash
of
bonds
totalled
an
trillion
and
served
as
a
key
plank
of
its
crisis
response
over
time
this
became
a
political
liability
as
republicans
in
particular
urged
the
central
bank
to
pull
back
from
financial
markets
former
fed
chair
janet
yellen
ignored
their
demands
to
sell
off
the
assets
out
of
concern
a
withdrawal
from
the
fed
could
shock
global
bond
markets
never
a
good
thing
instead
the
fed
is
allowing
its
assets
to
mature
and
roll
off
by
as
much
as
billion
per
month
so
far
with
little
apparent
disruption
over
the
last
year
it
has
winnowed
its
stash
to
around
trillion
interest
on
excess
reserves
the
crisis
upended
the
fed
s
method
for
controlling
its
target
interest
rate
which
it
previously
had
done
by
raising
or
lowering
the
supply
of
scarce
reserves
in
the
banking
system
in
the
world
the
fed
s
expanding
balance
sheet
meant
banks
were
flush
with
reserves
and
that
the
fed
needed
a
new
system
using
powers
earlier
authorized
by
congress
banks
are
now
paid
interest
on
reserves
parked
at
the
fed
creating
a
baseline
for
other
rates
though
also
politically
unpopular
among
some
lawmakers
the
system
has
largely
worked
well
with
some
adjustments
at
fixing
the
federal
funds
rate
within
the
range
set
by
officials
forecasting
the
fed
in
began
releasing
projections
each
quarter
from
its
governors
and
reserve
bank
presidents
for
economic
measures
that
first
set
of
forecasts
showed
median
growth
for
expected
at
percent
actual
growth
was
percent
the
first
in
a
series
of
forecast
misses
that
showed
just
how
poorly
the
country
s
top
economic
minds
were
at
unravelling
how
the
great
recession
changed
the
economy
it
did
matter
much
to
policy
at
the
time
rates
were
not
going
to
be
raised
anyway
but
it
arguably
nicked
the
fed
credibility
as
policymakers
were
continually
forced
to
downgrade
their
outlook
year
by
year
neutral
the
neutral
rate
of
interest
blessed
with
the
wonky
moniker
r
star
went
from
being
a
cornerstone
of
policy
and
a
fixation
of
researchers
under
former
chair
janet
yellen
to
a
source
of
confusion
under
jerome
powell
it
is
important
to
economic
models
in
trying
to
assess
the
point
at
which
the
fed
is
no
longer
influencing
economic
decisions
but
holding
things
steady
but
consider
policymakers
first
public
estimates
of
the
longer
run
federal
funds
rate
ran
from
to
percent
the
most
recent
issued
this
week
were
in
a
completely
different
range
from
percent
to
percent
foggy
to
say
the
least
political
economy
the
fed
ventured
into
the
unknown
during
the
crisis
slashing
interest
rates
to
zero
and
launching
a
massive
asset
purchase
program
its
oversight
since
has
been
intense
with
criticism
pulling
it
in
all
directions
depending

grilling
powell
in
february
your
task
is
to
continue
to
unwind
the
fed
s
asset
purchases
gradually
and
predictably
return
to
interest
rates
and
remove
monetary
distortions
from

without

president
donald

meanwhile
has
heaped
scorn
on
the

for
doing
just
that
calling

hikes
loco
and
asking
them
to
stop
with
the
s
when
it
comes
to
the

sheet
runoff
inflation
the
fed
has
yet
to
formally
declare
victory
on
its
percent
inflation
target
even
though
the
pace
of
price
increases
has
edged
toward
that
goal
it
has
not
convincingly
hit
or
exceeded
it
in
a
way
officials
believe
will
stick
and
the
readings
of
late
have
been
weaker
communications
the
fed
in
the
era
has
become
far
more
open
in
how
it
talks
to
the
public
and
markets
a
plus
in
an
era
when
it
was
acting
in
unconventional
ways
and
needed
to
maintain
public
trust
but
that
same
openness
has
caused
confusion
from
the
hailstorm
of
chatter
from
reserve
bank
presidents
to
the
misbegotten
nature
of
the
dot
plot
of
officials
estimates
of
where
the
fed
funds
rate
is
heading
the
fed
says
it
isn
t
a
forecast
but
markets
read
it
as
such
and
have
made
a
parlour
sport
of
guessing
which
dot
is
the
chair
s
and
thus
first
among
equals
meanwhile
powell
like
his
predecessors
has
had
his
stumbles
confounding
markets
in
recent
weeks
by
implying
rates
would
rise
fast
then
having
to
dial
that
back
just
this
week
the
fed
s
projections
showed
a
slowing
economy
and
a
slowing
set
of
rate
increases
while
its
statement
was
a
bullish
recount
