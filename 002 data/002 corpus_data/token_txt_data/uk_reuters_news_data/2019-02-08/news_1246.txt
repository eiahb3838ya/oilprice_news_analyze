london

iran
said
on
tuesday
it
would
boost
its
military
might
and
also
showcased
a
new
fighter
jet
amid
increased
tensions
with
the
united
states
and
with
regional
rivals
over
conflicts
in
the
middle
east
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
said
the
islamic
republic
s
military
prowess
was
what
deterred
washington
from
attacking
it
adding
that
under
president
donald
trump
the
united
states
was
becoming
isolated
even
from
its
own
allies
we
should
make
ourselves
ready
to
fight
against
the
military
powers
who
want
to
take
over
our
territory
and
our
resources
rouhani
said
in
a
speech
broadcast
live
on
state
television
ahead
of
wednesday
s
national
defence
industry
day
why
does
the
united
states
not
attack
us
because
of
our
power
because
it
knows
the
consequences
rouhani
added
last
week
iran
s
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
also
said
the
united
states
would
avoid
any
military
confrontation
with
tehran
because
of
iranian
military
might
khamenei
has
rejected
trump
s
offer
of
unconditional
talks
on
a
new
nuclear
deal
prompting
trump
to
tell
reuters
in
an
interview
on
monday
if
they
want
to
meet
that
s
fine
and
if
they
don
t
want
to
meet
i
couldn
t
care
relations
between
washington
and
tehran
worsened
further
after
trump
in
may
took
the
united
states
out
of
an
international
deal
that
curbed
tehran
s
nuclear
programme
in
return
for
an
easing
of
economic
sanctions
trump
branded
that
deal
as
flawed
because
it
did
not
address
iran
s
missile
programme
or
involvement
in
conflicts
in
syria
and
yemen
and
he
has
reimposed
economic
sanctions
rouhani
compared
the
sanctions
on
iran
with
the
trade
war
with
china
and
its
new
tariffs
on
some
imports
from
turkey
and
european
countries
it
s
not
only
us
who
do
not
trust
america
today
even
europe
and
china
do
not
trust
them
even
american
allies
like
canada
have
lost
their
trust
he
said
earlier
on
tuesday
rouhani
attended
a
ceremony
broadcast
by
state
tv
that
included
the
of
a
new
fighter
jet
called
kowsar
which
iran
says
is
indigenously
made
and
able
to
carry
various
weapons
and
to
be
used
for
short
aerial
support
missions
however
some
military
experts
believe
the
fighter
jet
is
a
carbon
copy
of
an
first
produced
in
the
united
states
in
the
the
airframe
appears
to
be
an
externally
unaltered
tiger
whilst
it
may
be
domestically
manufactured
it
s
an
entirely
foreign
airframe
said
justin
bronk
a
research
fellow
specialising
in
combat
airpower
and
technology
in
the
military
sciences
team
at
the
royal
united
services
institute
it
s
a
very
small
lightweight
fighter
with
very
small
engines
which
limits
the
thrust
output
a
very
low
internal
fuel
capacity
which
limits
range
and
a
very
small
nose
which
limits
the
size
and
power
of
radar
that
you
can
fit
he
told
reuters
all
of
those
constraints
are
not
going
to
be
changed
by
updating
the
internal
components
while
you
might
put
a
modern
radar
or
modern
avionics
by
iranian
standards
in
there
it
is
still
going
to
be
subject
to
all
limitations
of
the
iran
s
air
force
has
been
limited
to
perhaps
a
few
dozen
strike
aircraft
using
either
russian
or
ageing
models
acquired
before
the
iranian
revolution
iran
has
sent
weapons
and
thousands
of
soldiers
to
syria
to
help
prop
up
president
bashar
s
forces
but
had
to
rely
on
russia
for
aerial
support
due
to
its
own
lack
of
a
powerful
air
force
the
islamic
republic
launched
in
what
it
said
was
a
new
domestically
built
fighter
jet
called
qaher
but
some
experts
expressed
doubts
about
the
viability
of
the
aircraft
at
the
time
