minutes
it
s
a
very
strong
political
choice
at
a
time
when
we
are
paying
very
close
attention
to
public
the
insee

agency
estimates
that
in
some
million
people
in
france
were
living

poverty
defined
as

that
was
equivalent
to
percent
of

from
fresh
funds
or
existing
cash
reallocated
from
other
budgets
macron
s
poverty
plan
which
has
already
been
delayed
once
has
been
much
anticipated

he
seeks
to
convince

his
reform
agenda
does
not
benefit
only
the
wealthy
and
businesses
griveaux
did
not
specify

would
be
spent
but
said
the
government
planned
several
measures
to
get
people
either
back
to
work
or
into
better
jobs
while
various
welfare
programmes
have
been
expanded
over
the
last
two
decades
griveaux
said
they
had
failed
to
root
out
the
causes
of
poverty
