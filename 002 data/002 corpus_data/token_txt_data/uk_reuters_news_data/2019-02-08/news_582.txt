london
reuters
prime
minister
theresa
may
vowed
to
fight
for
her
draft
divorce
deal
with
the
european
union
on
thursday
after
the
resignation
of
her
brexit
secretary
and
other
ministers
put
her
strategy
and
her
job
in
peril
just
over
hours
after
may
announced
that
her
cabinet
had
agreed
to
the
terms
of
the
deal
brexit
secretary
dominic
raab
and
work
and
pensions
minister
esther
mcvey
resigned
eurosceptics
in
may
s
conservative
party
said
they
had
submitted
letters
calling
for
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
her
leadership
may
called
a
news
conference
at
her
downing
street
residence
to
underline
her
determination
to
stay
the
course
asked
if
she
would
contest
any
challenge
to
her
position
she
replied
am
i
going
to
see
this
through
however
hostility
from
government
and
opposition
mps
raised
the
risk
that
the
deal
would
be
rejected
in
parliament
and
that
britain
could
leave
the
eu
on
march
without
a
safety
net
that
prospect
pushed
the
pound
down
as
much
as
percent
to
although
it
recovered
slightly
after
may
s
statement
the
main
stock
index
in
ireland
which
is
highly
dependent
on
trade
with
britain
plunged
percent
the
german
carmaker
bmw
which
produces
its
mini
model
in
britain
said
that
with
the
political
situation
so
uncertain
it
would
continue
to
prepare
for
a
brexit
two
junior
ministers
two
ministerial
aides
and
the
conservatives
vice
chairman
joined
raab
and
mcvey
in
quitting
may
said
she
understood
their
unhappiness
but
added
i
believe
with
every
fibre
of
my
being
that
the
course
i
have
set
out
is
the
right
one
for
our
country
and
all
our
people
i
am
going
to
do
my
job
of
getting
the
best
deal
for
by
seeking
to
preserve
the
closest
possible
ties
with
the
eu
may
has
upset
her
party
s
many
advocates
of
a
clean
break
and
northern
ireland
s
democratic
unionist
party
dup
which
props
up
her
minority
government
meanwhile
proponents
of
closer
relations
with
the
eu
in
her
own
party
and
the
labour
opposition
say
the
deal
squanders
the
advantages
of
membership
for
little
gain
both
sides
say
it
effectively
cedes
power
to
the
eu
without
securing
the
promised
benefits
of
greater
autonomy
it
is
mathematically
impossible
to
get
this
deal
through
the
house
of
commons
the
stark
reality
is
that
it
was
dead
on
arrival
said
conservative
lawmaker
mark
francois
the
deal
will
need
the
backing
of
about
of
parliament
s
mps
to
pass
the
ultimate
outcome
remains
uncertain
scenarios
include
may
s
deal
ultimately
winning
approval
may
losing
her
job
britain
leaving
the
bloc
with
no
agreement
or
even
another
referendum
analysts
from
bank
citi
said
britain
was
now
likely
either
to
stay
in
the
eu
or
leave
without
a
deal
jacob
the
leader
of
a
conservative
eurosceptic
group
in
parliament
said
the
draft
was
worse
than
anticipated
and
he
had
formally
requested
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
may
at
least
conservative
mps
openly
said
they
had
submitted
such
letters
although
others
could
have
done
so
secretly
are
needed
to
trigger
a
challenge
but
may
told
parliament
the
choice
is
clear
we
can
choose
to
leave
with
no
deal
we
can
risk
no
brexit
at
all
or
we
can
choose
to
unite
and
support
the
best
deal
that
can
be
told
journalists
the
next
prime
minister
should
be
someone
who
believed
in
brexit
but
a
may
ally
former
home
secretary
amber
rudd
told
sky
news
the
problem
isn
t
the
prime
minister
the
problem
is
the
challenges
she
s
got
to
deliver
in
trying
to
pull
together
this
brexit
she
s
the
best
person
to
do
the
labour
party
said
the
government
was
falling
apart
in
parliament
mps
from
all
sides
spent
three
hours
mostly
attacking
the
draft
agreed
with
the
eu
on
tuesday
after
more
than
a
year
of
difficult
negotiations
no
democratic
nation
has
ever
signed
up
to
be
bound
by
such
an
extensive
regime
imposed
externally
without
any
democratic
control
over
the
laws
to
be
applied
nor
the
ability
to
decide
to
exit
the
arrangement
raab
said
in
his
resignation
letter
others
said
the
irish
backstop
to
be
used
if
no
better
way
can
be
found
to
avoid
future
checks
on
the
border
between
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
and
ireland
would
tear
britain
apart
leaving
northern
ireland
all
but
inside
the
eu
s
single
market
it
was
this
arrangement
which
sees
britain
and
the
eu
establishing
a
single
customs
territory
but
northern
ireland
aligned
more
closely
with
the
eu
that
spurred
most
criticism
the
dup
has
threatened
to
pull
its
support
from
the
minority
government
if
the
backstop
means
the
province
is
treated
differently
from
mainland
britain
eu
leaders
are
ready
to
meet
on
to
sign
off
on
the
divorce
deal
or
withdrawal
agreement
but
french
prime
minister
edouard
philippe
summed
up
the
uncertainty
when
he
said
events
in
london
raised
concerns
about
whether
it
would
be
ratified
we
need
to
prepare
ourselves
for
a
brexit
he
said
a
group
of
eu
states
including
france
also
raised
objections
to
what
has
been
agreed
so
far
on
fishing
between
the
eu
and
uk
after
brexit
diplomatic
sources
said
raab
was
named
brexit
secretary
in
july
after
the
resignation
of
his
predecessor
david
davis
who
also
quit
in
protest
at
may
s
strategy
at
the
heart
of
raab
s
criticism
was
the
belief
that
the
pursuit
of
a
temporary
customs
union
with
the
eu
would
be
the
starting
point
for
talks
on
the
future
relationship
with
the
bloc
severely
prejudicing
what
britain
could
achieve
he
said
he
could
not
support
an
indefinite
backstop
arrangement
and
that
may
s
plan
threatened
the
integrity
of
the
united
kingdom
