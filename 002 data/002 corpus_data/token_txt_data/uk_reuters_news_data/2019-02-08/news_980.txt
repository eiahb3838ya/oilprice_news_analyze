bank of england can unwind qe without hurting economy - vlieghe
london
reuters
the
bank
of
england
can
reverse
its
huge
stimulus
programme
without
sharply
pushing
up
interest
rates
and
hurting
the
economy
as
long
it
explains
the
plan
properly
and
moves
only
gradually
a
top
boe
policymaker
said
on
tuesday
gertjan
vlieghe
said
the
careful
messages
sent
out
by
the
federal
reserve
about
the
reversal
of
its
quantitative
easing
qe
programme
had
avoided
sending
the
wrong
signals
about
how
fast
it
will
wean
the
economy
off
its
stimulus
the
boe
said
in
june
it
might
start
to
unwind
the
billion
pounds
of
government
bonds
it
has
amassed
since
the
financial
crisis
once
its
benchmark
interest
rate
reaches
percent
double
its
current
level
understanding
the
main
channels
through
which
qe
works
is
going
to
be
very
important
when
it
comes
to
unwinding
qe
vlieghe
one
of
the
central
bank
s
nine
monetary
policymakers
said
in
a
speech
at
imperial
college
in
london
on
tuesday
his
speech
challenged
the
boe
s
view
that
qe
works
mostly
through
portfolio
rebalancing
or
the
idea
that
a
central
bank
s
government
bond
purchases
force
investors
to
buy
other
assets
like
corporate
bonds
helping
the
economy
vliehge
argued
that
qe
shaped
expectations
of
future
policy
steps
which
implies
that
unwinding
qe
need
not
have
a
material
impact
on
the
shape
of
the
yield
curve
or
indeed
on
the
economy
if
properly
communicated
and
done
gradually
jp
morgan
economist
allan
monks
said
vlieghe
had
presented
a
new
case
for
the
view
among
policymakers
that
qe
had
a
more
powerful
impact
on
pushing
rates
down
when
a
central
bank
buys
bonds
than
on
pushing
rates
up
when
the
purchases
are
unwound
vlieghe
said
economists
should
look
back
into
history
for
where
rates
might
be
heading
he
said
the
yield
curve
the
difference
between
the
return
on
short
and
debt
had
been
flat
in
the
period
before
world
war
one
when
the
gold
standard
was
still
in
force
since
the
boe
was
granted
independence
in
britain
s
inflation
and
inflation
risk
fundamentals
had
been
more
similar
to
the
gold
standard
period
than
the
century
average
so
we
should
expect
yield
curves
to
be
flat
again
on
average
he
said
he
repeated
his
view
that
one
or
two
interest
rates
hikes
a
year
would
be
needed
for
the
boe
to
meet
its
percent
inflation
target
