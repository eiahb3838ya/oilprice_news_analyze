south
african
president
cyril
ramaphosa
s
plan
to
split
struggling
state
power
utility
eskom
is
a
positive
show
of
intent
to
investors
but
a
lack
of
detail
has
raised
market
concerns
that
concrete
change
will
take
years
to
deliver
eskom
which
produces
over
percent
of
south
africa
s
electricity
and
employs
people
is
a
lynchpin
of
africa
s
most
developed
economy
but
is
drowning
in
billion
of
debt
facing
a
parliamentary
election
on
may
ramaphosa
said
on
thursday
that
to
avert
an
economic
crisis
eskom
s
generation
transmission
and
distribution
businesses
would
become
separate
entities
crucially
ramaphosa
added
that
the
newly
created
units
would
remain
under
an
eskom
holding
company
meaning
its
inefficient
and
unwieldy
monopoly
would
remain
he
also
said
another
eskom
bailout
would
be
laid
out
in
the
budget
later
this
month
what
markets
were
hoping
for
was
the
creation
of
three
independent
companies
that
could
more
easily
cut
costs
raise
finance
and
be
partially
privatised
in
the
future
most
eskom
bonds
eased
very
slightly
on
friday
with
the
bond
softening
cent
to
trade
at
cents
in
the
dollar
however
eskom
s
bonds
had
chalked
up
stellar
gains
in
previous
weeks
with
many
issues
seeing
their
best
monthly
gains
on
record
the
risk
is
very
little
will
change
in
this
structure
said
peter
attard
montalto
head
of
capital
markets
research
at
intellidex
the
intention
may
well
be
to
have
this
as
a
first
step
and
then
separate
out
after
that
from
the
umbrella
however
we
think
the
market
underestimates
how
complex
this
separation
process
will
be
he
added
forecasting
it
could
take
two
years
even
if
ramaphosa
intends
eventually
to
create
independent
units
that
could
be
partly
sold
off
he
will
face
fierce
resistance
from
elements
of
the
ruling
african
national
congress
anc
and
powerful
trade
unions
the
anc
is
expected
to
win
may
s
election
but
ramaphosa
will
need
the
support
of
a
united
ruling
party
and
union
allies
if
he
is
to
deliver
the
decisive
victory
that
would
give
him
a
mandate
to
push
through
unpopular
but
reforms
the
two
largest
unions
at
eskom
who
say
they
account
for
half
of
the
utility
s
workforce
said
on
friday
they
would
fight
ramaphosa
s
plan
with
one
calling
it
a
war
in
the
short
term
ramaphosa
will
need
to
raise
eskom
s
revenues
and
cut
its
debt
if
he
is
to
delay
inevitable
job
cuts
until
after
the
election
that
means
tariff
increases
and
bailouts
that
are
toxic
with
voters
i
agree
with
president
that
we
need
drastic
action
but
we
can
t
be
paying
for
them
screwing
up
all
the
time
said
thokozane
a
taxi
driver
in
johannesburg
if
they
have
to
cut
jobs
it
is
sad
but
we
can
t
go
on
year
after
year
with
these
bailouts
and
ramaphosa
is
also
trying
to
hold
together
the
anc
to
avoid
the
fate
of
his
predecessor
jacob
zuma
whom
he
ousted
a
year
ago
in
a
bitter
internal
battle
the
liberation
movement
remains
deeply
divided
between
socialist
and
reformist
elements
and
ramaphosa
faces
resistance
from
a
powerful
faction
a
task
team
formed
by
ramaphosa
to
create
a
reform
programme
for
eskom
recommended
more
policies
than
were
announced
however
a
backlash
from
members
of
his
cabinet
saw
the
plans
diluted
an
anc
source
said
ramaphosa
s
opponents
will
be
obstructing
him
every
step
of
the
way
with
his
plan
for
eskom
said
darias
jonker
director
for
africa
at
eurasia
group
a
political
risk
consultancy
this
is
yet
another
proxy
war
involving
entrenched
interests
linked
to
the
zuma
faction
in
the
it
is
likely
ramaphosa
will
avoid
major
job
cuts
at
eskom
until
after
the
election
while
the
details
of
restructuring
could
be
delayed
so
as
not
to
rile
allies
analysts
say
but
with
eskom
expected
to
lose
more
than
billion
a
year
this
year
and
next
there
is
only
so
long
ramaphosa
can
delay
reforms
without
risking
economic
malaise
investor
departure
and
credit
rating
downgrades
the
eskom
issue
needs
a
clear
resolution
and
we
did
not
get
that
yesterday
said
jonas
david
strategist
at
swiss
bank
ubs
eskom
is
a
big
concern
for
reporting

alexander
winning
