eu proposes tighter money laundering supervision but no single agency
brussels
reuters
the
european
commission
has
recommended
changes
to
banking
supervision
following
a
series
of
money
laundering
cases
but
stopped
short
of
setting
up
a
new
agency
to
tackle
financial
crime
as
called
for
by
the
european
central
bank
the
move
comes
after
dutch
giant
ing
last
week
admitted
it
had
failed
for
years
to
prevent
money
laundering
the
latest
in
a
string
of
incidents
involving
banks
in
malta
latvia
estonia
denmark
spain
and
luxembourg
the
european
banking
authority
eba
has
for
a
long
time
said
it
has
neither
enough
powers
nor
staff
to
combat
money
laundering
at
banks
in
the
european
union
states
eu
officials
said
the
eba
should
add
money
laundering
officials
to
its
current
count
of
just
out
of
its
nearly
staff
it
will
also
have
a
bigger
say
on
the
activities
of
bloc
s
national
banking
supervisors
and
could
force
investigations
into
banks
suspected
of
breaching
money
laundering
rules
national
supervisors
would
effectively
be
subject
to
money
laundering
stress
tests
on
their
application
of
the
rules
a
commission
official
said
adding
that
the
eba
would
have
to
publish
the
results
local
authorities
two
years
ago
took
little
action
against
a
maltese
lender
suspected
of
money
laundering
the
eba
only
opened
an
investigation
on
the
maltese
supervisory
system
after
extensive
media
pressure
and
in
july
said
there
were
general
and
systematic
shortcomings
in
the
island
s
application
of
eu
rules
the
commission
s
proposal
which
needs
the
approval
of
eu
states
and
lawmakers
comes
close
to
the
end
of
its
mandate
and
ahead
of
european
parliament
elections
in
may
as
a
result
eu
regulators
and
finance
ministers
do
not
envisage
any
concrete
action
before
next
year
last
week
the
ecb
called
for
the
establishment
of
a
single
agency
to
tackle
money
laundering
in
europe
but
the
proposal
does
not
include
this
bolder
measure
which
would
allow
centralised
supervision
similar
to
that
exercised
by
the
central
bank
over
the
financial
stability
of
euro
zone
banks
the
commission
also
stopped
short
of
proposing
to
harmonise
existing
rules
to
investigate
and
punish
money
laundering
which
currently
give
broad
discretion
to
member
states
causing
what
eu
regulators
called
gaps
in
the
bloc
s
legal
framework
states
are
for
instance
not
obliged
to
name
banks
that
are
found
to
have
money
laundering
failings
despite
international
guidelines
saying
the
negative
publicity
surrounding
the
imposition
of
fines
is
one
of
the
most
effective
tools
in
combating
financial
crime
judicial
sources
told
reuters
last
year
that
luxembourg
had
imposed
a
fine
of
million
euros
on
a
branch
of
industrial
and
commercial
bank
of
china
icbc
in
the
grand
duchy
after
an
investigation
in
spain
exposed
wrongdoings
but
luxembourg
is
still
declining
to
name
the
bank
