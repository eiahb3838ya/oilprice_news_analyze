world
trade
organization
arbitrators
will
evaluate
a
request
to
impose
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
sanctions
on
european
products
after
a
final
wto
ruling
that
found
the
european
union
had
given
illegal
subsidies
to
airbus
the
request
for
retaliation
for
losses
incurred
by
rival
boeing
in
the
dispute
over
claims
of
illegal
handouts
for
aircraft
makers
adds
fuel
to
mounting
transatlantic
trade
tensions
it
comes
as
eu
trade
commissioner
cecilia
malmstrom
said
in
brussels
that
she
hoped
an
eu
mission
to
washington
would
help
ease
a
trade
dispute
linked
to
steel
and
aluminium
but
that
the
bloc
is
preparing
a
list
of
imports
to
hit
if
the
united
states
imposes
tariffs
on
eu
cars
the
united
states
made
the
request
to
the
wto
last
friday
for
three
judges
to
set
the
level
of
retaliatory
sanctions
the
global
watchdog
said
in
a
document
posted
on
thursday
which
gave
no
figure
for
the
amount
of
sanctions
sought
the
wto
arbitration
is
expected
to
take
around
a
year
the
wto
appeals
body
ruled
on
may
that
the
eu
had
failed
to
remove
subsidised
government
development
loans
for
the
world
s
largest
airliner
the
and
europe
s
newest
jet
the
causing
losses
for
boeing
and
aerospace
workers
it
was
the
first
of
two
key
planemaker
subsidy
decisions
due
this
year
the
european
union
has
been
locked
in
a
parallel
row
with
the
united
states
over
prohibited
support
it
says
washington
has
given
boeing
and
malmstrom
has
said
she
wants
to
get
that
judgement
on
the
table
too
before
starting
any
negotiation
the
eu
told
the
wto
dispute
settlement
body
two
weeks
later
that
it
had
acted
within
days
of
the
ruling
in
the
case
to
bring
its
funding
of
airbus
into
line
with
wto
rules
a
trade
official
who
attended
the
meeting
said
but
a
representative
at
the
wto
meeting
said
it
was
hard
to
give
credence
to
the
eu
s
assertion
after
four
previous
rulings
that
had
disagreed
with
similar
eu
claims
to
have
brought
airbus
s
financing
into
line
with
market
benchmarks
the
united
states
in
its
initial
request
in
december
said
that
based
on
data
at
the
time
it
estimated
the
annual
value
of
lost
sales
at
between
billion
and
billion
