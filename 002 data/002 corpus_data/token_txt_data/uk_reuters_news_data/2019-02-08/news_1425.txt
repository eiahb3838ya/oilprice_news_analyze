the
commerce
department
will
continue
its
probe
into
whether
auto
imports
pose
a
national
security
risk
despite
ongoing
trade
talks
with
the
european
union
but
president
donald
trump
asked
that
no
action
be
taken
at
this
time
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
said
on
thursday
we
ve
been
directed
by
the
president
to
continue
the
investigation
get
our
material
together
but
not
actually
implement
anything
pending
the
outcome
of
the
negotiation
ross
told
reporters
aboard
air
force
one
the
trump
administration
in
may
launched
a
probe
into
whether
car
and
auto
part
imports
pose
a
national
security
risk
last
week
major
automakers
warned
imposing
tariffs
of
percent
on
imported
cars
and
parts
would
raise
the
price
of
vehicles
by
billion
billion
pounds
annually
cost
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
and
sharply
reduce
auto
sales
the
work
is
continuing
probably
sometime
in
the
month
of
august
we
ll
be
willing
to
render
a
report
ross
said
he
added
that
tariffs
on
foreign
autos
may
not
be
necessary
or
it
may
be
necessary
we
will
foreign
governments
and
automakers
reject
the
suggestion
that
imported
vehicles
pose
a
national
security
risk
and
no
automaker
has
backed
the
idea
they
have
insisted
the
probe
was
only
opened
to
press
for
concessions
in
trade
talks
we
had
to
take
a
route
of
trying
to
make
it
more
painful
for
the
other
parties
to
continue
bad
practices
than
to
drop
them
and
that
s
why
he
put
up
tariffs
to
put
pressure
on
and
it
seems
to
be
starting
to
work
ross
said
if
we
hadn
t
had
the
threat
of
automotive
tariffs
we
never
would
have
gotten
to
the
point
where
we
are
trump
s
threat
to
impose
the
percent
tariffs
on
auto
imports
which
would
harm
european
carmakers
such
as
bmw
and
volkswagen
was
put
on
hold
after
he
met
european
commission
president
juncker
at
the
white
house
on
wednesday
to
discuss
ongoing
trade
disputes
juncker
called
trump
s
decision
to
delay
any
tariffs
as
long
as
trade
talks
continue
a
major
other
officials
on
thursday
also
touted
an
agreement
with
the
eu
to
negotiate
a
solution
the
alliance
of
automobile
manufacturers
a
trade
group
representing
major
and
foreign
automakers
said
bilateral
negotiations
are
a
more
effective
approach
to
resolving
