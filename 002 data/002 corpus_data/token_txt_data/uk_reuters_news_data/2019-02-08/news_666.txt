riyadh

saudi
arabia
s
king
salman
has
embarked
on
a
domestic
tour
this
week
with
his
favourite
son
demonstrating
his
support
for
his
chosen
heir
despite
the
crisis
spawned
by
the
murder
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
roads
were
lined
with
saudi
flags
and
images
of
the
king
and
his
son
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
when
they
arrived
in
the
central
region
of
qassim
late
on
tuesday
distinguished
figures
greeted
them
and
children
offered
flowers
the
tour
is
the
latest
public
outreach
by
the
monarch
apparently
intended
to
shore
up
the
power
of
prince
mohammed
known
as
mbs
who
has
taken
over
rule
but
whose
international
reputation
was
battered
in
the
month
since
khashoggi
was
killed
in
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
state
media
said
the
king
laid
the
foundation
for
new
or
planned
projects
worth
billion
and
ordered
the
release
of
some
people
from
debtors
prison
in
qassim
a
conservative
province
in
the
heart
of
the
arabian
peninsula
there
is
a
lot
of
tension
fear
and
apprehension
among
saudis
in
the
aftermath
of
the
khashoggi
affair
so
it
s
a
trip
that
reassures
the
various
regions
that
the
king
is
still
in
his
place
and
he
s
the
highest
authority
said
madawi
a
saudi
author
critical
of
the
al
saud
turkish
officials
have
accused
mbs
of
ordering
khashoggi
s
murder
president
donald
trump
has
suggested
ultimate
responsibility
lies
with
the
crown
prince
as
de
facto
ruler
saudi
arabia
which
offered
numerous
contradictory
explanations
for
khashoggi
s
disappearance
now
says
the
washington
post
columnist
was
killed
in
a
rogue
operation
mbs
broke
weeks
of
silence
on
to
vow
justice
would
prevail
king
salman
stepped
in
to
defuse
the
situation
he
sent
a
trusted
aide
to
turkey
last
month
then
fired
five
senior
officials
including
his
son
s
most
trusted
adviser
after
weeks
of
lying
low
the
prince
has
now
returned
to
the
public
stage
he
visited
troops
near
the
border
with
yemen
where
riyadh
is
involved
in
a
war
appearing
in
an
online
video
on
monday
with
a
soldier
he
called
a
hero
in
a
ceremony
at
a

laid

for
a
planned

research
reactor
greg
gause
a

texas
a
m
university
said
the
domestic
tour
with
his
father
did
not
indicate
that
the
royal
family
is
in
the
clear
yet
only
that
the
king
is
confident
that
nothing
is
afoot
right
the
crown
prince
is
on
course
to
become
the
first
saudi
monarch
from
a
new
generation
in
years
following
a
succession
of
six
brothers
drawn
from
among
at
least
sons
of
state
founder
abdulaziz
ibn
saud
who
died
in
but
mbs
s
rise
has
upended
the
system
of
rule
in
place
for
decades
in
which
successive
kings
sought
family
consensus
and
allocated
powerful
posts
to
their
brothers
and
nephews
mbs
consolidated
his
rule
by
stripping
some
of
his
most
powerful
cousins
from
positions
of
authority
and
locking
some
under
house
arrest
others
were
caught
up
in
an
crackdown
and
confined
inside
a
luxury
hotel
for
months
there
have
been
signs
since
last
week
that
some
princes
are
being
rehabilitated
to
foster
family
unity
in
the
wake
of
the
khashoggi
killing
last
week
one
of
the
king
s
surviving
younger
brothers
prince
ahmed
bin
abdulaziz
returned
from
months
abroad
where
he
had
appeared
to
criticise
the
leadership
two
of
the
king
s
nephews
detained
last
year
appear
to
have
been
released
recently
with
pictures
circulating
of
them
reuniting
with
family
diplomats
say
the
ruling
family
is
circling
the
wagons
but
there
is
no
indication
king
salman
is
considering
elevating
another
prince
either
to
replace
his
son
or
balance
his
authority
by
serving
as
his
deputy
mbs
is
not
going
anywhere
the
family
is
meeting
and
they
will
unite
stronger
behind
him
said
a
senior
arab
diplomat
there
is
no
way
back
after
the
king
cleared
mbs
s
path
to
the
throne
by
sidelining
potential
rivals
last
year
the
king
s
decision
to
put
mbs
in
charge
of
restructuring
the
intelligence
apparatus
a
move
aimed
at
addressing
a
purported
cause
of
the
khashoggi
crisis
indicates
that
the
crown
prince
remains
untouchable
the
diplomat
added
on
tuesday
evening
as
king
salman
and
mbs
arrived
in
qassim
north
of
riyadh
to
a
stadium
of
cheering
residents
online
photos
emerged
showing
prince
abdulaziz
bin
fahd
with
his
brothers
and
daughters
in
a
residential
setting
the
images
were
the
first
of
the
prince
the
son
of
a
former
king
since
his
detention
which
the
government
never
acknowledged
it
was
not
made
clear
whether
he
had
reached
a
settlement
with
the
state
like
other
detainees
who
were
subsequently
released
or
if
his
freedom
is
still
restricted
over
the
weekend
another
of
the
king
s
nephews
a
brother
of
billionaire
investor
prince
alwaleed
bin
talal
was
photographed
at
his
ailing
father
s
bedside
after
being
held
for
months
over
online
criticism
of
the
purge
ordered
late
last
year
by
mbs
the
next
day
alwaleed
who
was
among
scores
of
top
royals
businessmen
and
government
officials
held
at
riyadh
s
hotel
as
part
of
the
sweep
went
on
fox
news
to
defend
mbs
in
the
khashoggi
crisis
and
the
campaign
i
believe
the
saudi
crown
prince
will
be
percent
vindicated
and
exonerated
alwaleed
said
of
his
cousin
alwaleed
s
own
detention
was
forgiven
and
forgotten
