realign
brazil
with
more
advanced
economies
such
as
the

overhauling
diplomatic
priorities
after
nearly
a
decade
and
a
half
of
leftist
party
rule
bolsonaro
won
the
presidential
race
handily
despite
scarce
campaign
resources
and
no
support
from

and
crime
in

monday
night
interview
with
tv
record
bolsonaro
offered
some
of
his
first
concrete
measures
on
both
fronts
bolsonaro
said
he
would
press
brazil
s
congress
to
loosen
the
country
s
restrictive
gun
laws
this
year
before
he
even
takes
office
on
january
he
reiterated
that
more
widespread
gun
ownership
would
limit
crime
although
critics
worry
it
could
add
to
brazil
s
tally
of
nearly
homicides
last
year
the
highest
in
the
world
bolsonaro
also
said
he
wants
to
nominate
the
crusading
judge
sergio
moro
to
be
his
justice
minister
or
the
newest
member
of
the
supreme
court
moro
who
has
overseen
the
car
wash
trials
that

did
not
immediately
reply

bolsonaro
a
former
paratrooper
joins
a
list
of
populist
figures
to
win
elections
in
recent
years
that
include
trump
philippine
president
rodrigo
duterte
and
hungarian
prime
minister
viktor
orban
trump
s
friendly
call
augurs
closer
political
ties
between
the
two
largest
economies
in
the
americas
both
now
led
by
conservative
populists
promising
to
overturn
the
political
establishment
in
a
telephone
call
on

with

mike
pompeo
bolsonaro
discussed
collaboration
on
priority
foreign
policy
issues
including
venezuela
tackling
transnational
crime
and
ways
to
strengthen
economic
ties
bolsonaro
has
vowed
to
increase
pressure
on
venezuela
s
authoritarian
leftist
government
to
hold
free
elections
that
could
stem
the
flow
of
refugees
into
neighbouring
brazil
and
colombia
also
governed
by
a
conservative
president
mauricio
santoro
a
political
scientist
with
rio
de
janeiro
state
university
said
he
was
concerned
that
brazil
would
not
soon
dispel
the
tense
and
occasionally
violent
atmosphere
that
enveloped
the
polarizing
campaign
it
s
possible
that
even
with
his
win
we
could
see
a
further
wave
of
violence
among
bolsonaro
s
supporters
against
those
who
backed
his
opponent
santoro
said
bolsonaro
supporters
carried
out
physical
attacks
and
organised
campaigns
of
online
harassment
in
the
to
sunday

targeting

bolsonaro
won

of
votes
in
a
election
against
hopeful
fernando
haddad
of
the
workers
party
pt
who
got
percent
according
to
electoral
authority
tse
the
controversial
lawmaker
s
rise
has
been
propelled
by
rejection
of
the
leftist
pt
that
ran
brazil
for
of
the
last
years
and
was
ousted
two
years
ago
in
the
midst
of
a
deep
recession
and
political
graft
scandal
thousands
of
bolsonaro
supporters
cheered
and
set
off
fireworks
outside
his

beachfront
barra
de
tijuca
neighbourhood
as
his

was
announced
i
don

know
if
he
will
govern
well

we
are
hopeful

they
can
t
take
any
more
corruption
said
tatiana
cunha
a
systems
analyst
during
the
noisy
celebrations
investors
have
been
hopeful
that
bolsonaro
would
carry
out
fiscal
reforms
proposed
by
his
orthodox
economic
guru
paulo
guedes
brazil
s
benchmark
bovespa
stock
index
rose
as
much
as
percent
to
an
high
in
opening

led
higher
by
shares
of
firms
and
before
retreating
and
closing
percent
down
brazil
s
currency
the
real
has
gained
around
percent
against
the
dollar
this
month
as
bolsonaro
s
prospects
improved
investors
have
been
particularly
heartened
by
bolsonaro
s
choice
of
guedes
a
chicago
economist
and
investment
banker
as
future
economy
minister
guedes
who
wants
to
privatise
an
array
of
state
firms
said
on
sunday
the
new
government
will
try
to
erase
brazil
s
budget
deficit
within
a
year
simplify
and
reduce
taxes
and
create
million
jobs
by
cutting
payroll
taxes
new
rules
will
boost
investment
in
infrastructure
he
told

still
fitch
ratings
on
monday
highlighted
the
deep
fiscal
challenges
confronting
bolsonaro
s
team
as
weak
economic
growth
and
a
huge
budget
deficit
leave
little
room
to
manoeuvre
the
exact
details
of
how
his
administration
plans
to
achieve
its
objectives
are
limited
wrote
fitch
analysts
led
by
shelly
shetty
the
lack
of
fiscal
space
a
high
unemployment
rate
and
a
sluggish
economic
recovery
will
also
likely
limit
economic
policy
onyx
lorenzoni
a
fellow
congressman
whom
bolsonaro
has
tapped
as
chief
of
staff
told
journalists
that
guedes
would
be
responsible
for
structuring
the
government
s
relationship
with
an
independent
autonomous
central
bank
with
targets
asked
about
brazil
s
currency
lorenzoni
said
bolsonaro
would
offer
businesses
more
predictability
but
ruled
out
an
exchange
rate
target
lorenzoni
reiterated
his
view
that
efforts
to
reform
brazil
s
pension
system
should
wait
until
next
