bill
aimed
at
curbing
violent
protests
in
response
to
three
months
of
demonstrations
by

movement
despite
criticism
that
the
law
could
curb
civil
liberties
it
passed
the
lower
house
the

be
discussed

the
assembly
has
the
last
word
the
law
bans
protesters
from
hiding
their
faces

police
greater
powers
to
extract
potential
from
demonstrations

grants
local

the
right
to
ban
individual
protesters
the
yellow
vest
movement
erupted
in
november
as
a
protest
against
fuel
taxes
but
has
morphed
into
a
broader
revolt
against
inequality
and
macron
s
presidency
it
takes
its
name
from
the
fluorescent
vests
that
motorists
in
france
carry
in
their
cars
rioters
ran
amok
in
paris
during
the
early
street
protests
torching
cars
smashing
luxury
boutiques
and
defacing
the
arc
de
triomphe
it
was
among
the
worst
violence
the
capital
has
experienced
since
a
student
uprising
