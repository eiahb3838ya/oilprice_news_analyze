it
does

i
m
not

s
republican
party
going

more
than
percent
of
republican
and
adults
believe
increased
tariffs
between
the

states
and
its
trading
partners
will
be
good
for
the
country
according
to
a
pew
research
center
survey
released
late
thursday
however
most
economists
warn
that
the
imposition
of
import
tariffs
could
disrupt
global
manufacturing
supply
chains
raise
input
costs
and
raise
prices
for
consumers
leading
to
slower
economic
growth
after
the
interview
trump
reiterated
criticism
of
the
federal
reserve
s
planned
hikes
posting
on
twitter
that
the
tightening
policy
would
diminish
any
trade
advantage
and
exacerbate
losses
from
bad
trade
louis
federal
reserve
bank
james
bullard
said
on
friday
the
fed
would
remain
unaffected
by
trump
s
comments
on
monetary
policy
and
expressed
concerns
about
rising
tariffs
the
escalating
trade
war
if
it
goes
badly
could
be
a
risk
for
the
economy
bullard
said
adding
he
understands
the
policy
s
objective
but
it
could
be
that
all
we
end
up
with
is
a
lot
of
tariffs
globally
and
a
lot
of
other
types
of
protectionism
