u.s. military says no plans to suspend more major exercises on korean peninsula
washington
reuters
the
military
has
no
plans
yet
to
suspend
any
more
major
military
exercises
with
south
korea
the
defence
secretary
said
on
tuesday
in
the
middle
of
a
breakdown
in
diplomacy
with
north
korea
over
its
nuclear
weapons
defense
secretary
james
mattis
told
a
pentagon
news
conference
that
no
decisions
had
been
made
about
major
exercises
for
next
year
but
noted
that
the
suspension
of
drills
this
summer
as
a
gesture
to
north
korea
was
not
president
donald
trump
s
june
decision
to
unilaterally
suspend
the
drills
caught
many
american
military
planners
off
guard
and
was
broadly
criticised
as
a
premature
concession
to
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
who
trump
wants
to
give
up
his
nuclear
weapons
we
took
the
step
to
suspend
several
of
the
largest
exercises
as
a
measure
coming
out
of
the
singapore
summit
mattis
told
reporters
referring
to
the
june
meeting
between
trump
and
kim
we
have
no
plans
at
this
time
to
suspend
any
more
exercises
he
said
adding
that
no
decisions
had
yet
been
made
on
major
exercises
for
next
year
mattis
also
said
smaller
exercises
deemed
to
be
exempt
from
the
suspension
were
ongoing
mattis
comments
on
the
drills
come
at
a
delicate
time
for
negotiations
between
the
united
states
and
north
korea
after
trump
scrapped
plans
for
a
meeting
between
top
officials
from
both
countries
at
the
june
summit
the
first
meeting
between
a
serving
president
and
a
north
korean
leader
kim
agreed
in
broad
terms
to
work
towards
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
but
north
korea
has
given
no
indication
it
is
willing
to
give
up
its
weapons
unilaterally
as
the
trump
administration
has
demanded
since
then
diplomats
have
failed
to
advance
the
process
north
korean
officials
even
warned
in
a
letter
to
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
last
week
that
denuclearisation
talks
risked
falling
apart
officials
told
reuters
in
particular
the
north
wants
steps
towards
a
peace
treaty
the
korean
war
ended
in
an
armistice
rather
than
a
peace
treaty
leaving
forces
technically
still
at
war
with
north
korea
officials
fear
north
korea
might
turn
its
attention
to
cutting
a
separate
deal
with
south
korea
and
driving
a
wedge
between
the
korea
alliance
a
south
korea
presidential
spokesman
acknowledged
that
talks
between
washington
and
pyongyang
were
at
a
stalemate
with
north
korea
and
the
remaining
stalemated
there
is
an
even
bigger
need
for
an
summit
kim
a
spokesman
for
the
presidential
blue
house
told
a
briefing
south
korean
president
moon
said
this
month
his
planned
third
summit
with
north
korea
s
kim
next
month
would
be
another
step
towards
the
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
and
an
end
to
the
korean
war
trump
abruptly
cancelled
his
top
diplomat
s
planned
trip
to
north
korea
on
friday
publicly
acknowledging
for
the
first
time
that
his
effort
to
get
pyongyang
to
denuclearize
had
stalled
since
his
summit
with
the
north
s
leader
trump
partly
blamed
china
for
the
lack
of
progress
with
north
korea
and
suggested
that
talks
with
pyongyang
led
so
far
by
pompeo
could
be
on
hold
until
after
washington
resolved
its
bitter
trade
dispute
with
beijing
on
sunday
north
korea
s
state
media
accused
the
united
states
of
and
hatching
a
criminal
plot
but
did
not
mention
pompeo
s
cancelled
visit
intelligence
and
defence
officials
have
repeatedly
expressed
doubts
about
north
korea
s
willingness
to
give
up
its
nuclear
weapons
and
they
had
not
expected
pompeo
s
trip
to
yield
positive
results
mattis
declined
to
comment
on
the
broader
diplomatic
efforts
deferring
to
pompeo
s
state
department
we
will
work
very
closely
as
i
said
with
the
secretary
of
state
and
what
he
needs
done
we
will
certainly
do
to
reinforce
his
effort
but
at
this
time
there
is
no
discussion
about
further
suspensions
mattis
said
the
traditional
calendar
for
other
major
drills
does
not
pick
up
again
until
next
spring
officials
say
which
could
give
diplomats
and
military
planners
time
the
korean
exercise
calendar
hits
a
high
point
every
spring
with
the
foal
eagle
and
max
thunder
drills
which
take
months
to
plan
one
defence
official
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
said
preliminary
planning
for
next
year
s
drills
was
already
taking
place
still
the
official
acknowledged
that
would
not
be
indicative
of
whether
the
drills
will
go
forward
max
thunder
s
air
combat
exercises
so
unnerved
north
korea
this
year
that
it
issued
threatening
statements
that
nearly
scuttled
