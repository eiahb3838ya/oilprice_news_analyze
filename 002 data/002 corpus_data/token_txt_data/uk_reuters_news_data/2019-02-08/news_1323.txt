frankfurt
reuters
investors
dumped
euro
zone
bank
shares
on
friday
on
concerns
about
their
exposure
to
turkey
as
the
lira
fell
to
yet
another
record
low
with
a
defiant
government
showing
few
signs
it
is
ready
to
take
decisive
steps
to
stabilise
the
currency
a
widening
rift
with
the
united
states
its
main
nato
ally
and
president
tayyip
erdogan
s
grip
on
monetary
policy
under
a
new
powerful
executive
presidency
have
helped
to
drive
the
lira
down
by
more
than
percent
this
year
a
particular
vulnerability
for
turkish
banks
as
over
a
third
of
their
lending
is
in
foreign
currencies
president
donald
trump
said
on
friday
he
had
authorised
higher
tariffs
on
imports
from
turkey
imposing
a
percent
duty
on
aluminium
and
percent
one
on
steel
as
tensions
rose
between
the
two
nato
allies
over
ankara
s
detention
of
an
american
pastor
and
other
diplomatic
issues
the
euro
zone
bank
was
exacerbated
by
a
report
in
the
financial
times
that
the
european
central
bank
is
increasingly
concerned
about
some
lenders
particularly
bbva
of
spain
unicredit
of
italy
and
bnp
paribas
of
france
as
they
have
some
of
the
largest
operations
in
turkey
among
euro
zone
banks
the
ecb
declined
to
comment
sources
familiar
with
its
work
added
that
a
review
has
been
going
on
for
several
weeks
and
this
was
considered
a
prudent
supervisory
practice
given
the
situation
this
echoed
the
ft
report
which
said
that
the
situation
was
not
yet
considered
critical
shares
in
bbva
were
down
percent
late
on
friday
unicredit
was
off
percent
and
bnp
dropped
percent
all
exceeding
a
percent
drop
in
the
euro
zone
bank
index
turkey
accounted
for
million
euros
of
bbva
s
its
first
half
net
attributable
profit
percent
of
the
group
total
suggesting
that
it
may
be
the
most
vulnerable
to
the
country
s
market
turmoil
the
bank
declined
to
comment
unicredit
whose
turkish
unit
yapi
kredi
is
viewed
by
goldman
sachs
analysts
as
the
most
vulnerable
in
terms
of
capital
levels
played
down
its
exposure
in
its
recent
earnings
presentation
it
argued
that
the
country
accounted
for
less
than
percent
of
group
revenues
and
a
percent
fall
in
the
lira
would
affect
its
ratio
capital
that
must
be
set
aside
as
a
buffer
against
financial
shocks
by
only
around
basis
points
it
declined
to
comment
on
friday
however
a
report
by
credit
suisse
said
turkey
remained
a
risk
for
unicredit
italy
s
biggest
bank
by
assets
as
the
depreciation
of
the
lira
could
further
hit
its
core
capital
which
came
in
lower
than
expected
at
the
end
of
june
the
yapi
kredi
stake
is
valued
on
the
bank
s
books
at
billion
and
is
currently
worth
billion
credit
suisse
said
in
a
report
on
friday
the
turkish
risks
may
also
come
from
potential
asset
quality
deterioration
as
turkish
corporate
could
be
under
pressure
due
to
its
large
amount
of
debt
usd
denominated
it
said
we
can
not
rule
out
that
the
regulator
may
require
an
on
capital
for
the
unicredit
is
also
exposed
to
the
rouble
s
fall
and
widening
italian
government
bond
spreads
bbva
which
reported
a
lowly
cet
ratio
of
percent
at
the
end
of
the
first
half
also
said
a
percent
slump
in
the
lira
would
shave
basis
points
off
its
core
capital
data
from
the
bank
of
international
settlements
indicate
that
banks
exposure
to
turkey
is
about
billion
in
the
case
of
spain
and
billion
for
italy
relatively
low
figures
given
that
top
euro
zone
banks
have
combined
total
assets
of
more
than
trillion
euros
much
of
these
exposures
are
also
lira
in
the
balance
sheets
of
local
subsidiaries
suggesting
that
the
actual
risk
to
their
parent
firms
is
even
smaller
while
the
lira
s
plunge
could
drag
down
the
turkish
economy
the
impact
on
euro
zone
banks
in
general
is
seen
as
modest
economists
said
the
surge
in
turkish
inflation
bond
yields
and
the
even
more
dramatic
plunge
in
turkey
s
exchange
rate
in
suggest
that
the
country
could
now
be
in
danger
of
heading
for
a
bust
berenberg
economist
carsten
hesse
said
the
impact
on
euro
zone
gdp
growth
would
be
small
hesse
added
the
total
damage
from
a
turkish
recession
would
be
smaller
than
percentage
point
to
the
euro
zone
still
the
may
not
be
over
after
the
government
struck
a
defiant
tone
on
friday
even
after
trump
s
move
erdogan
who
says
a
shadowy
interest
rate
lobby
and
western
credit
ratings
agencies
are
attempting
to
undermine
turkey
s
economy
said
turks
should
exchange
their
gold
and
dollars
into
lira
to
help
the
currency
