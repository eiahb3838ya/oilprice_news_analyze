the

sfo
said
on
tuesday
it
was
seeking
to
resurrect
a
prosecution
of
barclays
over
undisclosed
payments
to
qatari
investors
during
the
credit
crisis
two
months
after
a
london
court
dismissed
its
case
the
agency
had
been
praised
as
fearless
for
taking
on
one
of
the
world
s
largest
banks
when
it
first
charged
barclays
and
four
former
senior
executives
including
a
chief
executive
with
criminal
offences
in
june
but
the
prosecution
fell
at
the
first
hurdle
after
a
london
court
in
may
threw
out
its
charges
of
conspiracy
to
commit
fraud
and
unlawful
financial
assistance
against
barclays
plc
and
a
charge
of
unlawful
financial
assistance
against
its
subsidiary
barclays

had
been
charged
over
payments
to
qatari
investors
in
connection
with
a
billion
pound
billion
emergency
fundraising
that
included
a
billion
loan
to

of
the

the
deal

the
bank
to
avoid
a
state
bailout
the
sfo
said
it
had
applied
to
the
high
court
for
permission
to
serve
a
draft
indictment
a
rare
legal
procedure
once
called
a
voluntary
bill
of
indictment
that
allows
prosecutors
to
challenge
a
decision
made
in
the
lower
crown
court
the
sfo
last
applied
for
a
voluntary
bill
of
indictment
unsuccessfully
in
a
welsh
mining
rights
case
in
and
lawyers
said
it
was
a
risky
strategy
the
sfo
is
attempting
a
second
bite
of
the
cherry
which
could
be
a
strategy
and
viewed
as
a
misstep
said
charles
kuhn
a
partner
at
law
firm
clyde
barclays
which
said
in
may
it
expected
the
sfo
to
try
to
reinstate
the
case
plans
to
oppose
the
application
it
declined
to
comment
on
the
substance
of
the
sfo
s
case
the
case
centers
on
agreements
between
barclays

authorities
examined
whether
payments
from
barclays
to
qatar
at
the
same
time
such
as
advisory
services
agreements
and
the
billion
loan
were
honest

qatar
a
major
investor
in
britain
has
not
been
accused
of
wrongdoing
any
failure
to
revive
the
case
would
mark
a
major
setback
for
the
sfo

narrowly
avoided
being
rolled
into
