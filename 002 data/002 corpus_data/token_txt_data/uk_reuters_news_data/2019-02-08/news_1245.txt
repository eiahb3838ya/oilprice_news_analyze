cohen testifies trump told him to commit crime by paying off women
new
york
reuters
president
donald
trump
s
former
personal
lawyer
michael
cohen
testified
on
tuesday
that
trump
had
directed
him
to
commit
a
crime
by
arranging
payments
ahead
of
the
presidential
election
to
silence
two
women
who
said
they
had
affairs
with
trump
cohen
s
voice
cracked
several
times
as
he
pleaded
guilty
to
eight
criminal
charges
in
federal
court
in
manhattan
including
tax
evasion
bank
fraud
and
campaign
finance
violations
facing
up
to
five
years
in
prison
the
admissions
were
a
dramatic
change
from
cohen
s
earlier
boasts
that
he
was
trump
s
fixer
and
would
take
a
bullet
for
the
president
most
legal
experts
say
a
sitting
president
can
not
be
indicted
for
a
crime
but
the
constitution
allows
congress
to
impeach
and
remove
a
president
from
office
for
high
crimes
and
cohen
s
accusation
increases
political
pressure
for
trump
ahead
of
november
s
congressional
elections
where
democrats
are
trying
to
regain
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
senate
cohen
told
judge
william
pauley
iii
that
in
coordination
with
and
at
the
direction
of
a
candidate
for
federal
office
he
arranged
payments
to
two
women
for
their
silence
for
the
principal
purpose
of
influencing
the
star
stormy
daniels
was
given
and
former
playboy
model
karen
mcdougal
was
paid
cohen
did
not
name
trump
in
court
but
his
lawyer
lanny
davis
said
afterward
that
he
was
referring
to
the
president
today
he
cohen
stood
up
and
testified
under
oath
that
donald
trump
directed
him
to
commit
a
crime
by
making
payments
to
two
women
for
the
principal
purpose
of
influencing
an
election
davis
said
in
a
statement
if
those
payments
were
a
crime
for
michael
cohen
then
why
wouldn
t
they
be
a
crime
for
donald
trump
davis
said
trump
has
denied
having
affairs
with
the
women
his
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
has
said
the
payments
were
made
to
spare
trump
and
his
family
embarrassment
and
were
unrelated
to
the
campaign
trump
did
not
mention
cohen
at
a
rally
in
west
virginia
hours
later
giuliani
lashed
out
at
cohen
on
tuesday
calling
him
a
devious
little
rat
and
saying
he
had
a
history
of
lying
i
think
the
president
is
absolutely
in
the
clear
giuliani
told
reuters
the
cohen
thing
is
under
election
law
campaign
contributions
defined
as
things
of
value
given
to
a
campaign
to
influence
an
election
must
be
disclosed
a
payment
intended
to
silence
allegations
of
an
affair
just
before
an
election
could
constitute
a
campaign
contribution
which
is
limited
to
per
person
per
election
some
experts
said
ross
garber
a
lawyer
who
has
represented
four
republican
governors
in
impeachment
proceedings
said
cohen
s
statement
dramatically
increases
the
likelihood
that
were
democrats
to
take
control
of
the
house
in
the
midterms
they
would
begin
an
impeachment
the
odds
of
an
investigation
have
definitely
gone
up
garber
said
the
guilty
pleas
came
in
the
same
hour
that
a
federal
jury
in
alexandria
virginia
convicted
former
trump
campaign
chairman
paul
manafort
of
eight
charges
of
tax
and
bank
fraud
and
failing
to
disclose
foreign
bank
accounts
the
manafort
conviction
resulted
from
special
counsel
robert
mueller
s
investigation
into
russian
meddling
in
the
election
and
possible
coordination
with
the
trump
campaign
the
charges
against
manafort
mostly
predate
his
work
on
trump
s
campaign
the
probe
also
led
to
a
referral
from
mueller
about
cohen
to
federal
prosecutors
in
new
york
who
began
their
own
probe
of
the
longtime
trump
lawyer
trump
has
repeatedly
denied
any
collusion
and
has
called
the
mueller
investigation
a
witch
russia
has
denied
meddling
in
the
election
although
intelligence
agencies
have
concluded
moscow
interfered
mueller
has
also
brought
indictments
against
russian
intelligence
officers
in
the
hacking
of
democratic
national
committee
emails
cohen
is
scheduled
for
sentencing
on
and
his
bail
was
set
at
davis
told
cnn
he
believed
his
client
had
information
that
would
be
of
interest
to
the
special
counsel
but
did
not
give
further
details
mueller
s
investigation
which
began
in
may
has
resulted
in
the
indictment
of
more
than
people
and
five
guilty
pleas
