london
reuters
former
scottish
first
minister
alex
salmond
said
on
wednesday
he
has
resigned
from
the
scottish
national
party
which
he
led
for
two
decades
days
after
allegations
of
sexual
misconduct
became
publicly
known
salmond
has
denied
the
allegations
and
taken
legal
action
against
the
snp
administration
he
once
ran
over
the
way
it
has
handled
the
complaints
against
him
the
driving
force
behind
scotland
s
independence
referendum
and
still
a
popular
figure
in
scotland
salmond
said
he
was
taking
the
action
to
protect
the
snp
from
its
opponents
and
avoid
any
internal
division
were
he
to
have
been
suspended
from
the
party
i
did
not
come
into
politics
to
facilitate
opposition
attacks
on
the
snp
and
with
parliament
returning
next
week
i
have
tendered
my
resignation
to
remove
this
line
of
opposition
attack
salmond
said
in
a
statement
salmond
said
he
would
reapply
to
the
party
if
he
wins
his
court
action
at
the
same
time
he
launched
a
appeal
to
raise
pounds
to
help
pay
his
legal
costs
against
the
scottish
government
over
its
handling
of
the
misconduct
complaints
against
him
the
scottish
government
said
last
week
two
allegations
of
misconduct
against
salmond
were
filed
in
january
of
this
year
salmond
said
he
rejects
any
suggestion
of
criminality
salmond
who
headed
the
devolved
scottish
government
for
seven
years
until
is
credited
with
helping
to
push
support
for
scottish
independence
from
the
united
kingdom
to
record
levels
during
the
referendum
campaign
scots
however
voted
percent
in
favour
of
staying
in
the
uk
nicola
sturgeon
his
successor
as
party
leader
and
first
minister
has
come
under
pressure
from
opposition
parties
to
suspend
his
membership
while
the
claims
are
investigated
sturgeon
said
she
felt
a
huge
sadness
about
this
whole
situation
but
understood
why
he
decided
to
resign
she
said
that
scotland
s
battle
for
independence
is
bigger
than
any
one
salmond
s
relationship
with
his
own
party
has
been
more
strained
since
he
lost
his
seat
in
the
westminster
parliament
last
year
i
am
conscious
that
if
the
party
felt
forced
into
suspending
me
it
would
cause
substantial
internal
division
salmond
said
he
intended
to
reapply
for
party
membership
just
as
soon
as
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
clear
my
name
which
he
hoped
would
be
by
the
end
of
the
year
for
my
part
i
have
always
thought
it
a
very
poor
idea
to
suspend
any
party
member
on
the
basis
of
complaints
and
allegations
salmond
said
innocent
until
proven
guilty
is
central
to
our
concept
