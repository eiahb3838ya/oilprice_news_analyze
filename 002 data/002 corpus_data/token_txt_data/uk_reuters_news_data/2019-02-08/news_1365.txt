singapore
reuters
north
korea
and
the
united
states
on
saturday
sparred
over
an
agreement
reached
at
a
landmark
summit
in
june
for
the
asian
country
to
end
its
nuclear
program
as
washington
called
for
maintaining
sanctions
pressure
against
pyongyang
which
in
turn
said
it
was
alarmed
by
intentions
the
discord
at
a
regional
forum
in
singapore
was
the
latest
reminder
of
the
difficulties
that
have
long
impaired
efforts
to
negotiate
an
end
to
north
korea
s
nuclear
and
missile
programmes
despite
commitments
made
at
an
unprecedented
summit
between
president
donald
trump
and
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
in
the
city
state
less
than
two
months
ago
the
dprk
stands
firm
in
its
determination
and
commitment
for
implementing
the
joint
statement
in
a
responsible
and
manner
north
korea
s
foreign
minister
ri
yong
ho
told
the
asean
regional
forum
using
his
country
s
official
name
the
democratic
people
s
republic
of
korea
what
is
alarming
however
is
the
insistent
moves
manifested
within
the
to
go
back
to
the
old
far
from
its
leader
s
intention
he
said
ri
made
the
statement
after
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
had
left
the
singapore
conference
centre
for
indonesia
having
pressed
southeast
asian
nations
to
maintain
sanctions
on
north
korea
until
it
gives
up
a
nuclear
weapons
programme
that
now
threatens
the
united
states
at
the
june
summit
kim
who
is
seeking
relief
from
tough
sanctions
committed
to
work
towards
denuclearisation
but
north
korea
has
offered
no
details
on
how
it
might
go
about
this
pompeo
suggested
on
friday
that
continued
work
on
weapons
programmes
by
north
korea
was
inconsistent
with
kim
s
commitment
to
denuclearise
on
saturday
he
nevertheless
said
he
was
optimistic
a
north
korean
denuclearisation
could
be
achieved
although
it
would
take
some
ri
said
north
korea
had
made
goodwill
gestures
including
a
moratorium
on
nuclear
tests
and
rocket
launches
and
the
dismantling
of
a
nuclear
test
ground
however
the
united
states
instead
of
responding
to
these
measures
is
raising
its
voice
louder
for
maintaining
the
sanctions
against
the
dprk
and
showing
the
attitude
to
retreat
even
from
declaring
the
end
of
the
war
a
very
basic
and
primary
step
for
providing
peace
on
the
korean
peninsula
he
said
on
saturday
pompeo
said
washington
took
very
seriously
any
relaxation
of
sanctions
calling
out
russia
for
possibly
violating
a
resolution
by
issuing
work
visas
to
north
korean
workers
i
want
to
remind
every
nation
that
has
supported
these
resolutions
that
this
is
a
serious
issue
and
something
that
we
will
discuss
with
moscow
he
said
we
expect
the
russians
and
all
countries
to
abide
by
the
security
council
resolutions
and
enforce
sanctions
on
north
russia
has
denied
a
report
by
the
wall
street
journal
that
said
moscow
was
allowing
thousands
of
fresh
north
korean
labourers
into
the
country
and
granting
them
work
permits
in
a
potential
breach
of
sanctions
russia
s
ambassador
to
north
korea
also
denied
moscow
was
flouting
restrictions
on
oil
supplies
to
north
korea
according
to
a
confidential
report
seen
by
reuters
on
friday
north
korea
has
not
stopped
nuclear
and
missile
programs
in
violation
of
united
nations
sanctions
although
pompeo
has
been
leading
negotiating
efforts
with
north
korea
he
had
no
formal
meeting
with
ri
in
singapore
however
at
a
group
photo
session
on
saturday
he
walked
up
to
the
north
korean
and
shook
hands
and
exchanged
words
and
smiles
he
told
ri
we
should
talk
again
soon
the
state
department
said
i
agree
there
are
many
productive
conversations
to
be
had
ri
replied
according
to
the
state
department
pompeo
later
tweeted
that
it
had
been
a
quick
polite
exchange
and
there
had
been
the
opportunity
to
deliver
a
letter
for
kim
jong
un
from
trump
ambassador
sung
kim
handed
ri
the
letter
which
the
state
department
said
was
in
return
for
one
from
kim
to
trump
that
the
white
house
said
was
received
on
wednesday
the
state
department
has
not
said
what
is
in
trump
s
letter
to
kim
trump
posted
a
note
on
twitter
on
thursday
thanking
kim
for
returning
the
remains
of
soldiers
from
the
korean
war
and
saying
he
looked
forward
to
seeing
kim
again
soon
although
the
white
house
said
no
second
meeting
was
currently
planned
it
is
not
the
first
time
since
the
summit
that
north
korea
has
appeared
to
offer
a
more
negative
impression
of
the
progress
of
talks
with
the
united
states
that
washington
following
a
trip
to
pyongyang
in
july
pompeo
spoke
of
progress
but
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
country
north
korea
accused
him
of
diplomacy
casting
doubts
about
the
future
of
the
discussions
even
so
trump
has
continued
to
hail
progress
emphasizing
the
halt
in
bomb
and
missile
tests
and
north
korea
s
return
of
purported
american
war
remains
a
senior
state
department
official
sought
to
play
down
ri
s
statement
saying
it
was
to
be
expected
much
of
the
intervention
was
positive
and
that
s
an
improvement
from
the
past
the
official
said
we
re
building
a
relationship
with
north
korea
after
years
of
difficult
since
talks
with
north
korea
resumed
this
year
pompeo
has
primarily
engaged
with
kim
yong
chol
a
top
north
korean
party
official
and
former
spy
agency
chief
not
ri
pompeo
told
a
senate
committee
hearing
on
july
that
north
korea
was
continuing
to
produce
fuel
for
nuclear
bombs
in
spite
of
its
denuclearisation
pledge
on
monday
a
senior
official
said
spy
satellites
had
detected
renewed
activity
at
the
north
korean
factory
that
produced
the
country
s
first
intercontinental
ballistic
missiles
capable
of
reaching
the
united
