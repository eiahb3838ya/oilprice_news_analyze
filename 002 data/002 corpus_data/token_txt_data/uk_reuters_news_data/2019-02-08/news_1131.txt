merkel accuses far-right party of stoking ethnic tension
berlin
reuters
chancellor
angela
merkel
on
thursday
accused
the
alternative
for
germany
afd
of
using
violent
protests
over
a
fatal
stabbing
blamed
on
migrants
to
stir
up
ethnic
tension
groups
clashed
with
police
and
chased
people
they
deemed
to
be
migrants
in
the
eastern
city
of
chemnitz
on
after
police
said
a
syrian
and
an
iraqi
had
been
detained
as
suspects
in
the
killing
of
a
german
man
afd
leader
alexander
gauland
had
earlier
this
week
urged
a
peaceful
revolution
against
merkel
s
liberal
immigration
policy
and
said
this
required
banishing
politicians
and
members
of
the
media
who
support
the
merkel
system
asked
about
the
role
of
the
afd
in
the
events
in
chemnitz
merkel
told
the
rtl
broadcaster
the
afd
is
stirring
up
the
mood
and
this
has
to
be
said
clearly
i
view
some
of
their
remarks
very
the
protests
in
chemnitz
have
set
off
a
debate
about
whether
politicians
are
being
too
complacent
in
the
face
of
rising
xenophobia
in
a
country
where
many
had
thought
the
lessons
of
germany
s
nazi
history
had
been
learned
the
protests
during
which
some
members
of
an
crowd
performed
the
illegal
hitler
salute
laid
bare
the
divisions
in
germany
over
merkel
s
decision
in
to
take
in
around
one
million
mostly
muslim
asylum
seekers
a
survey
of
voters
for
broadcaster
ard
conducted
on
monday
and
tuesday
and
published
on
thursday
showed
just
percent
believed
the
integration
of
refugees
into
society
had
been
successful
with
percent
believing
it
had
gone
badly
some
in
germany
blame
merkel
s
liberal
immigration
policy
for
the
rise
of
the
afd
which
entered
parliament
for
the
first
time
in
an
election
last
year
as
the
party
after
the
violence
in
chemnitz
german
politicians
urged
intelligence
agencies
to
start
monitoring
the
party
some
of
whose
members
marched
with
supporters
of
the
pegida
group
in
the
city
last
weekend
to
protest
the
stabbing
merkel
repeated
her
position
in
the
rtl
interview
that
only
intelligence
chiefs
can
decide
whether
to
monitor
the
party
we
first
want
to
deal
with
the
afd
politically
merkel
said
the
state
intelligence
agency
in
thuringia
on
thursday
said
it
would
examine
whether
the
afd
s
state
chapter
was
pursuing
goals
a
possible
step
towards
putting
the
group
under
official
surveillance
merkel
s
immigration
policy
has
also
caused
a
rift
within
her
conservative
bloc
which
includes
her
christian
democrats
cdu
and
their
christian
social
union
csu
bavarian
allies
that
almost
toppled
her
coalition
government
in
june
interior
minister
and
csu
leader
horst
seehofer
had
threatened
to
pull
out
of
the
coalition
government
over
immigration
in
an
interview
with
the
rheinische
post
published
on
thursday
seehofer
said
people
are
annoyed
and
outraged
because
of
such
homicides
and
i
understand
that
if
i
had
not
been
a
minister
i
would
have
taken
to
the
streets
as
a
citizen
but
of
course
not
with
the
he
added
i
understand
it
when
people
protest
but
this
doesn
t
make
them
seehofer
has
taken
an
increasingly
hardline
stance
on
immigration
as
his
party
tries
to
fight
off
a
strong
challenge
from
the
afd
in
october
s
regional
election
in
bavaria
seehofer
was
rebuked
by
politicians
and
germans
on
social
media
for
telling
csu
members
in
the
eastern
state
of
brandenburg
on
wednesday
migration
is
the
mother
of
all
asked
what
she
thought
about
seehofer
s
remark
merkel
said
i
say
it
differently
migration
presents
us
with
challenges
and
here
we
have
problems
but
