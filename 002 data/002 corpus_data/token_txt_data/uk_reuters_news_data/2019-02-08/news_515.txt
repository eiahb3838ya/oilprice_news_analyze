reuters
european
union
judges
dismissed
a
case
brought
by
a
world
war
two
veteran
and
other
britons
living
on
the
continent
against
the
brexit
negotiation
ruling
on
monday
that
their
rights
as
eu
citizens
had
not
yet
been
infringed
harry
shindler
a
living
in
italy
was
among
expatriates
who
complained
to
the
eu
s
general
court
that
brexit
would
deprive
them
of
eu
citizenship
and
that
the
decision
last
year
by
the
bloc
s
council
of
member
states
to
accept
notification
of
britain
s
withdrawal
next
march
breached
their
rights
because
they
had
been
denied
a
vote
in
the
referendum
on
monday
the
court
dismissed
the
action
as
inadmissible
because
the
council
s
move
to
start
talks
with
london
did
not
in
itself
carry
any
definite
consequences
for
their
rights
the
decision
of
the
council
authorising
the
opening
of
negotiations
on
brexit
does
not
produce
binding
legal
effects
capable
of
affecting
the
interests
of
the
applicants
by
bringing
about
a
distinct
change
in
their
legal
position
it
said
julien
fouchet
a
french
lawyer
acting
for
the
plaintiffs
said
they
would
appeal
to
the
court
of
justice
the
eu
s
top
court
unacceptable
he
tweeted
the
fight
goes
shindler
had
taken
a
demand
that
all
expatriates
be
given
a
vote
in
the
referendum
to
london
s
high
court
judges
there
ruled
two
months
before
the
vote
that
this
would
be
too
difficult
for
the
authorities
campaigners
say
millions
of
british
citizens
fall
foul
of
a
law
depriving
them
of
a
vote
after
years
abroad
under
article
of
the
eu
treaty
prime
minister
theresa
may
notified
the
european
council
on
march
that
britain
would
leave
the
bloc
setting
in
motion
a
countdown
that
will
see
britain
leave
in
four
months
time
on
sunday
may
and
the
other
eu
leaders
formally
agreed
a
treaty
setting
terms
for
departure
and
outlining
a
close
future
trading
relationship
but
the
british
parliament
may
yet
reject
that
deal
britain
could
then
leave
without
clear
legal
terms
on
tuesday
the
european
court
of
justice
in
luxembourg
will
hear
a
case
brought
by
scottish
politicians
who
oppose
brexit
and
want
judges
to
rule
on
whether
the
article
notification
process
can
be
simply
revoked
by
the
british
government
whether
or
not
other
eu
states
agree
they
hope
that
can
strengthen
a
campaign
to
have
brexit
halted
altogether
although
may
insists
it
will
go
ahead
