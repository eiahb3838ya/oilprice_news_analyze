when
danny
reagan
was
he
began
exhibiting
signs
of
what
doctors
usually
associate
with
drug
addiction
he
became
agitated
secretive
and
withdrew
from
friends
he
had
quit
baseball
and
boy
scouts
and
he
stopped
doing
homework
and
showering
but
he
was
not
using
drugs
he
was
hooked
on
youtube
and
video
games
to
the
point
where
he
could
do
nothing
else
as
doctors
would
confirm
he
was
addicted
to
his
electronics
after
i
got
my
console
i
kind
of
fell
in
love
with
it
danny
now
and
a
junior
in
a
cincinnati
high
school
said
i
liked
being
able
to
kind
of
shut
everything
out
and
just
danny
was
different
from
typical
american
teenagers
psychiatrists
say
internet
addiction
characterized
by
a
loss
of
control
over
internet
use
and
disregard
for
the
consequences
of
it
affects
up
to
percent
of
americans
and
is
becoming
more
common
around
the
world
we
re
all
mildly
addicted
i
think
that
s
obvious
to
see
in
our
behavior
said
psychiatrist
kimberly
young
who
has
led
the
field
of
research
since
founding
the
center
for
internet
addiction
in
it
becomes
a
public
health
concern
obviously
as
health
is
influenced
by
the
psychiatrists
such
as
young
who
have
studied
compulsive
internet
behavior
for
decades
are
now
seeing
more
cases
prompting
a
wave
of
new
treatment
programs
to
open
across
the
united
states
mental
health
centers
in
florida
new
hampshire
pennsylvania
and
other
states
are
adding
inpatient
internet
addiction
treatment
to
their
line
of
services
some
skeptics
view
internet
addiction
as
a
false
condition
contrived
by
teenagers
who
refuse
to
put
away
their
smartphones
and
the
reagans
say
they
have
had
trouble
explaining
it
to
extended
family
anthony
bean
a
psychologist
and
author
of
a
clinician
s
guide
to
video
game
therapy
said
that
excessive
gaming
and
internet
use
might
indicate
other
mental
illnesses
but
should
not
be
labeled
independent
disorders
it
s
kind
of
like
pathologizing
a
behavior
without
actually
understanding
what
s
going
on
he
said
at
first
danny
s
parents
took
him
to
doctors
and
made
him
sign
contracts
pledging
to
limit
his
internet
use
nothing
worked
until
they
discovered
a
pioneering
residential
therapy
center
in
mason
ohio
about
miles
km
north
of
cincinnati
the
reboot
program
at
the
lindner
center
for
hope
offers
inpatient
treatment
for
to
who
like
danny
have
addictions
including
online
gaming
gambling
social
media
pornography
and
sexting
often
to
escape
from
symptoms
of
mental
illnesses
such
as
depression
and
anxiety
danny
was
diagnosed
with
attention
deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
at
age
and
anxiety
disorder
at
and
doctors
said
he
developed
an
internet
addiction
to
cope
with
those
disorders
reboot
patients
spend
days
at
a
suburban
facility
equipped
with
bedrooms
classrooms
a
gym
and
a
dining
hall
they
undergo
diagnostic
tests
psychotherapy
and
learn
to
moderate
their
internet
use
chris
tuell
clinical
director
of
addiction
services
started
the
program
in
december
after
seeing
several
cases
including
danny
s
where
young
people
were
using
the
internet
to
instead
of
drugs
and
alcohol
the
internet
while
not
officially
recognized
as
an
addictive
substance
similarly
hijacks
the
brain
s
reward
system
by
triggering
the
release
of
chemicals
and
is
accessible
from
an
early
age
tuell
said
the
brain
really
doesn
t
care
what
it
is
whether
i
pour
it
down
my
throat
or
put
it
in
my
nose
or
see
it
with
my
eyes
or
do
it
with
my
hands
tuell
said
a
lot
of
the
same
neurochemicals
in
the
brain
are
even
so
recovering
from
internet
addiction
is
different
from
other
addictions
because
it
is
not
about
getting
sober
tuell
said
the
internet
has
become
inevitable
and
essential
in
schools
at
home
and
in
the
workplace
it
s
always
there
danny
said
pulling
out
his
smartphone
i
feel
it
in
my
pocket
but
i
m
better
at
ignoring
medical
experts
have
begun
taking
internet
addiction
more
seriously
neither
the
world
health
organization
who
nor
the
american
psychiatric
association
recognize
internet
addiction
as
a
disorder
last
year
however
the
who
recognized
the
more
specific
gaming
disorder
following
years
of
research
in
china
south
korea
and
taiwan
where
doctors
have
called
it
a
public
health
crisis
some
online
games
and
console
manufacturers
have
advised
gamers
against
playing
to
excess
youtube
has
created
a
time
monitoring
tool
to
nudge
viewers
to
take
breaks
from
their
screens
as
part
of
its
parent
company
google
s
digital
wellbeing
initiative
who
spokesman
tarik
jasarevic
said
internet
addiction
is
the
subject
of
intensive
research
and
consideration
for
future
classification
the
american
psychiatric
association
has
labeled
gaming
disorder
a
condition
for
further
whether
it
s
classified
or
not
people
are
presenting
with
these
problems
tuell
said
tuell
recalled
one
person
whose
addiction
was
so
severe
that
the
patient
would
defecate
on
himself
rather
than
leave
his
electronics
to
use
the
bathroom
research
on
internet
addiction
may
soon
produce
empirical
results
to
meet
medical
classification
standards
tuell
said
as
psychologists
have
found
evidence
of
a
brain
adaptation
in
teens
who
compulsively
play
games
and
use
the
internet
it
s
not
a
choice
it
s
an
actual
disorder
and
a
disease
said
danny
people
who
joke
about
it
not
being
serious
enough
to
be
super
official
it
hurts
me
