london
reuters
british
lawmakers
launched
an
inquiry
on
friday
into
computer
systems
failures
at
financial
services
firms
after
a
number
of
outages
in
recent
months
left
millions
of
customers
unable
to
access
their
money
or
make
vital
payments
the
treasury
committee
of
lawmakers
said
it
will
examine
how
financial
firms
are
trying
to
guard
against
it
failings
and
whether
regulators
have
the
skills
and
powers
to
hold
them
to
account
when
customers
lose
out
in
the
last
year
and
a
half
financial
firms
including
equifax
tsb
visa
barclays
cashplus
and
royal
bank
of
scotland
have
experienced
it
failures
nicky
morgan
chair
of
the
committee
said
measly
apologies
and
hollow
words
from
financial
services
institutions
will
not
suffice
when
consumers
aren
t
able
to
access
their
own
money
and
face
delays
in
paying
bills
she
said
the
computer
systems
failings
have
come
at
a
particularly
sensitive
time
as
banks
increasingly
nudge
customers
towards
their
online
channels
in
a
bid
to
cut
costs
compared
with
serving
them
through
physical
branches
the
treasury
committee
said
it
is
hiring
a
specialist
advisor
to
inform
the
inquiry
which
could
lead
to
recommendations
to
the
government
on
tougher
regulations
or
penalties
for
it
failings
a
botched
it
project
at
tsb
owned
by
spain
s
sabadell
earlier
this
year
led
to
one
of
britain
s
banking
outages
and
the
resignation
of
tsb
chief
executive
paul
pester
in
the
wake
of
sustained
and
bruising
questioning
by
the
committee
about
his
handling
of
the
crisis
as
part
of
the
lawmakers
announcement
of
their
probe
they
published
the
responses
of
banks
that
have
suffered
recent
outages
explaining
what
went
wrong
a
glitch
that
hit
thousands
of
business
and
personal
customers
of
barclays
on
was
caused
by
a
rare
interaction
between
two
software
systems
that
had
been
recently
tweaked
barclays
chief
executive
jes
staley
said
in
a
letter
to
morgan
an
unrelated
outage
that
hit
rbs
customers
the
very
next
day
was
caused
by
incorrect
implementation
of
a
network
firewall
rule
update
rbs
chief
executive
ross
mcewan
said
in
a
letter
published
by
the
treasury
