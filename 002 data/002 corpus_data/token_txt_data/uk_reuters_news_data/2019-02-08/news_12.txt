timetable
for
the

volume
is
estimated
at
barrels

crude

of
natural
resources
the
spill
and
subsequent
shutdown
of
portions
of
enbridge
s
platte
pipeline
and
the
bigger
keystone
line
raised
fresh
concerns
about
pipeline
safety
and
about
the
already
constricted
flow
of
canadian
oil
to
refineries
crews
were
excavating
a
segment
of
the

friday
transcanada
spokesman
terry
cunha
said

said
there
was
no

the
keystone
pipeline
is
a
critical

taking
canadian
crude
from
northern

spill
in
rural
charles
county
missouri
on

source
it

unclear
how

the
release
lasted

on
thursday
that
it
was
declaring
force

on
shipments
affected
by
the

a
notice
seen
by

force
majeure
is
a
declaration
that
unforeseeable
circumstances
prevented
a

to
order
