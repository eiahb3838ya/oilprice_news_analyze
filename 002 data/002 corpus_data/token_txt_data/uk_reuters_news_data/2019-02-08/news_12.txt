trucks
carrying
humanitarian
aid
for
venezuela
arrived
in
the
colombian
border
city
of
cucuta
on
thursday
as
president
nicolas
maduro
appeared
set
to
block
its
entry
amid
an
escalating
political
crisis
the
arrival
of
the
aid
convoy
which
includes
supplies
provided
by
the
united
states
has
increased
the
pressure
on
maduro
hours
after
a
european
group
called
for
dialogue
and
elections
and
warned
against
interventionism
maduro
has
rejected
the
aid
convoy
as
a
political
show
and
vowed
to
remain
in
office
despite
dozens
of
nations
around
the
world
disavowing
his
leadership
and
recognising
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
as
the
country
s
rightful
head
of
state
escorted
by
police
motorcycles
the
trucks
pulled
into
cucuta
where
venezuelans
were
waiting
to
see
whether
maduro
s
government
would
clear
the
border
road
he
has
blocked
and
allow
the
humanitarian
shipments
to
pass
the
crowd
waved
signs
denouncing
maduro
as
a
cancer
and
celebrated
the
arrival
of
the
convoy
this
gives
me
such
hope
especially
for
the
family
that
i
left
behind
my
children
my
wife
said
israel
escobar
a
venezuelan
who
came
to
cucuta
a
year
ago
to
sell
on
the
streets
this
is
one
more
step
towards
ending
that
terrible
across
the
border
on
the
venezuelan
side
a
group
of
around
protesters
demanded
that
the
aid
be
let
through
maduro
has
overseen
an
economic
collapse
that
has
left
millions
struggling
to
eat
and
fuelled
an
unprecedented
migration
crisis
in
the
region
an
estimated
million
venezuelans
have
left
the
opec
country
since
some
of
whom
have
ended
up
in
colombia
but
maduro
showed
little
sign
of
relenting
on
aid
as
a
bridge
linking
colombia
and
venezuela
remained
blocked
with
a
cistern
and
two
shipping
containers
the
humanitarian
aid
operation
is
a
show
a
cheap
show
a
bad
show
maduro
said
in
interview
with
mexican
newspaper
la
jornada
published
on
thursday
you
can
be
sure
that
it
won
t
disturb
on
thursday
he
appeared
in
an
event
at
the
presidential
palace
as
part
of
a
campaign
by
government
supporters
demanding
an
end
to
aggression
against
venezuela
elliott
abrams
washington
s
special
envoy
on
venezuela
said
the
aid
effort
was
being
coordinated
with
guaido
s
team
but
that
the
aid
would
not
be
forced
into
venezuela
let
it
in
that
s
what
we
re
asking
let
it
in
abrams
told
reporters
at
a
state
department
briefing
calling
on
members
of
venezuela
s
armed
forces
to
persuade
maduro
to
step
down
or
to
disobey
his
orders
he
said
the
supplies
would
be
delivered
to
venezuelans
when
it
was
logistically
safe
to
do
so
washington
last
week
implemented
crippling
sanctions
on
venezuelan
oil
firm
pdvsa
which
are
expected
to
exacerbate
the
hyperinflationary
economic
crisis
offering
a
to
washington
s
stance
the
eu
and
a
group
of
latin
american
governments
that
have
kept
a
moderate
line
on
venezuela
called
for
dialogue
and
fresh
elections
the
international
contact
group
on
venezuela
in
its
inaugural
meeting
in
the
uruguayan
capital
of
montevideo
said
overly
forceful
intervention
could
aggravate
the
crisis
eu
foreign
policy
chief
federica
mogherini
said
a
resolution
ultimately
must
come
from
the
people
of
venezuela
this
is
not
only
the
most
desirable
result
but
is
the
only
result
if
we
want
to
avoid
more
suffering
and
a
chaotic
process
mogherini
said
maduro
via
twitter
welcomed
the
call
for
dialogue
critics
have
said
three
previous
dialogue
processes
have
allowed
the
ruling
socialist
party
to
stall
for
time
without
making
major
concessions
on
key
issues
including
imprisoned
opposition
politicians
and
electoral
transparency
guaido
has
galvanized
the
opposition
since
taking
over
as
head
of
venezuela
s
national
assembly
in
january
last
month
he
declared
himself
interim
president
opening
the
door
for
washington
and
others
to
recognise
him
as
the
legitimate
leader
maduro
who
calls
guaido
a
puppet
seeking
to
foment
a
coup
has
maintained
power
with
the
backing
of
venezuela
s
military
one
venezuelan
air
force
general
and
several
venezuelan
diplomats
abroad
have
turned
on
maduro
and
recognised
guaido
the
websites
of
venezuelan
embassies
in
brazil
argentina
and
mexico
on
thursday
posted
statements
recognising
guaido
which
the
embassies
quickly
dismissed
as
the
work
of
hackers
reiterating
absolute
support
for
maduro
the
international
monetary
fund
which
a
new
government
in
caracas
would
likely
call
on
for
financial
assistance
is
awaiting
guidance
from
its
member
countries
on
whether
to
recognise
guaido
