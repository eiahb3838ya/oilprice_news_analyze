austria
would
support
granting
britain
more
time
for
negotiations
to
avoid
it
crashing
out
of
the
european
union
with
no
exit
deal
chancellor
sebastian
kurz
said
on
wednesday
though
he
stressed
the
current
deal
could
not
be
renegotiated
the
uk
parliament
resoundingly
rejected
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
brexit
divorce
deal
on
tuesday
prompting
expressions
of
concern
among
eu
leaders
who
say
they
are
stepping
up
emergency
planning
for
a
possible
hard
brexit
kurz
said
the
eu
could
help
to
further
clarify
aspects
of
the
withdrawal
deal
but
that
britain
needed
to
take
the
initiative
and
state
clearly
what
it
wants
regarding
the
future
relations
there
is
of
course
the
possibility
of
further
defining
certain
points
if
this
helps
to
avoid
a
hard
brexit
scenario
kurz
told
a
news
conference
in
vienna
the
main
target
is
to
avoid
a
hard
brexit
if
we
need
more
time
to
reach
that
then
we
should
consider
that
option
kurz
said
echoing
a
proposal
by
german
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
eu
on
march
though
speculation
has
increased
that
the
deadline
may
have
to
be
extended
to
allow
may
more
time
to
overcome
deep
divisions
in
her
conservative
party
and
in
the
uk
parliament
