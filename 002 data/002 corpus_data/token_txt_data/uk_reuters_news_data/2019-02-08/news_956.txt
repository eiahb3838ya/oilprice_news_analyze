london
reuters
gina
miller
who
took
the
british
government
to
court
over
triggering
brexit
said
if
britain
leaves
the
european
union
next
year
all
sides
must
accept
the
result
and
the
campaign
to
remain
in
the
bloc
should
be
abandoned
more
than
two
years
since
the
eu
referendum
the
united
kingdom
its
politicians
and
its
business
leaders
remain
deeply
divided
over
brexit
while
prime
minister
theresa
may
has
yet
to
clinch
a
divorce
deal
with
the
eu
opponents
of
brexit
are
exploring
ways
to
stop
what
they
say
is
britain
s
biggest
mistake
since
world
war
two
miller
is
leading
a
campaign
to
have
another
referendum
but
she
said
if
the
government
manages
to
successfully
navigate
an
exit
deal
then
politicians
must
be
allowed
to
focus
on
domestic
issues
without
the
distractions
of
a
debate
about
britain
s
relationship
with
europe
whatever
happens
at
the
end
of
the
brexit
process
we
have
got
to
draw
a
line
under
it
miller
told
reuters
on
friday
in
an
interview
in
mayfair
in
central
london
everyone
is
obsessed
our
bandwidth
is
completely
taken
up
with
brexit
our
money
our
time
we
can
t
carry
on
like
this
we
need
to
make
the
best
of
the
complexity
of
delivering
brexit
has
sapped
the
government
s
time
as
officials
focus
on
creating
new
systems
for
policing
immigration
and
customs
settling
the
rights
of
citizens
in
each
other
s
countries
negotiating
a
potential
exit
bill
and
preparing
to
strike
new
trade
deals
miller
who
an
investment
management
company
and
campaigns
for
transparency
in
the
industry
is
one
of
the
most
outspoken
campaigners
on
brexit
best
known
for
successfully
taking
the
government
to
the
supreme
court
to
challenge
its
authority
to
leave
the
eu
without
a
vote
in
parliament
she
now
wants
a
new
referendum
this
time
offering
voters
the
option
of
leaving
on
the
terms
of
may
s
deal
or
staying
in
a
reformed
eu
or
for
there
to
be
another
general
election
miller
has
been
vilified
in
the
media
and
faced
death
threats
harassment
and
racial
abuse
for
her
views
opinion
polls
show
britain
remains
deeply
divided
over
brexit
though
some
recent
surveys
have
shown
a
swing
towards
support
for
staying
in
the
eu
while
supporters
have
praised
miller
opponents
have
cast
her
as
a
wealthy
member
of
an
establishment
which
wants
to
soften
or
slow
brexit
in
defiance
of
the
wishes
of
the
people
a
british
aristocrat
was
sentenced
to
weeks
in
prison
last
year
for
racial
threats
against
miller
and
she
said
that
a
few
weeks
ago
she
was
sent
a
package
with
crystals
in
and
that
if
she
had
opened
it
it
would
have
burned
her
hands
campaigners
on
both
sides
of
the
argument
have
been
stepping
up
their
efforts
in
recent
weeks
as
some
brexiteers
argue
for
a
cleaner
break
from
the
eu
and
remainers
say
ending
membership
as
currently
planned
would
do
economic
damage
to
britain
miller
says
it
is
very
likely
britain
will
need
to
hold
a
second
referendum
on
eu
membership
or
a
general
election
to
break
the
deadlock
over
brexit
some
eurosceptic
rebels
in
may
s
party
and
opposition
parties
have
publicly
said
they
will
oppose
the
prime
minister
s
plans
to
leave
the
eu
if
the
opposition
parties
and
just
over
a
dozen
rebels
in
may
s
party
vote
against
a
deal
she
would
fall
short
of
the
majority
needed
to
get
her
deal
through
parliament
this
would
plunge
british
politics
into
crisis
and
increase
the
likelihood
that
britain
would
face
leaving
the
eu
without
an
agreement
or
face
the
possibility
of
another
general
election
or
a
second
referendum
there
s
no
way
out
other
than
to
give
it
back
to
the
people
miller
said
it
is
only
morally
and
democratically
right
to
give
people
a
miller
said
though
if
the
government
does
eventually
pass
a
deal
then
she
is
not
interested
in
leading
a
campaign
for
britain
to
the
eu
in
the
future
she
would
instead
like
to
campaign
on
other
constitutional
issues
like
devolving
policy
and
government
spending
away
from
london
to
the
rest
of
the
united
kingdom
at
what
point
do
you
need
to
say
that
the
country
needs
to
get
on
with
being
a
country
you
can
t
have
a
nation
living
in
stress
miller
said
whatever
happens
there
has
to
be
