telford shares tumble after flagging higher brexit risk in housing market
reuters
telford
homes
shares
fell
more
than
percent
on
wednesday
after
the
homebuilder
warned
of
lower
demand
especially
for
luxury
homes
as
the
uk
s
exit
from
the
european
union
approaches
the
british
property
market
was
among
the
hardest
hit
since
the
referendum
decision
to
leave
the
european
union
in
june
with
households
seeing
their
spending
power
pinched
by
inflation
that
has
risen
faster
than
pay
we
continue
to
see
very
little
domestic
investor
demand
from
individuals
telford
said
in
a
statement
adding
that
sales
of
homes
above
pounds
had
become
more
challenging
and
each
transaction
takes
longer
to
secure
this
is
not
expected
to
get
any
easier
in
the
short
term
as
negative
sentiment
is
leading
customers
to
take
a
wait
and
see
approach
or
to
look
for
more
significant
price
reductions
to
offset
a
perception
of
higher
risk
as
brexit
gets
closer
the
company
said
shares
in
the
company
were
down
percent
at
pence
at
gmt
and
were
among
the
top
losers
on
the
london
stock
exchange
telford
shares
suffered
their
biggest
drop
since
the
brexit
referendum
during
wednesday
s
session
homebuilders
have
increasingly
been
focussing
on
affordable
housing
as
it
is
becoming
harder
to
sell
premium
or
luxury
homes
because
britons
are
becoming
more
careful
with
money
the
companies
have
been
taking
advantage
of
the
government
s
scheme
which
helps
britons
get
on
the
housing
ladder
by
providing
them
subsidies
telford
which
has
about
employees
has
been
focussing
on
brownfield
opportunities
across
london
to
take
advantage
of
areas
where
demand
for
homes
exceeds
supply
it
has
concentrated
on
locations
across
london
and
forward
selling
to
customers
including
individual
investors
housing
associations
and
increasingly
institutional
investors
in
the
build
to
rent
sector
the
developer
of
mixed
use
sites
in
london
said
it
has
under
homes
left
to
sell
to
cross
its
target
of
million
pounds
of
pretax
profit
for
the
year
to
march
however
of
those
homes
are
priced
over
pounds
and
the
company
sees
a
greater
risk
in
them
telford
forecast
pretax
profit
to
exceed
mln
pounds
in
the
first
half
of
but
said
it
would
be
lower
than
the
second
half
of
next
year
