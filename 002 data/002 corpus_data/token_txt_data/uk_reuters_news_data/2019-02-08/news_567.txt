bangladesh
s
plans
to
tackle
the
rohingya
refugee
crisis
are
set
to
be
stalled
until
the
new
year
with
repatriation
and
relocation
programmes
only
likely
be
revisited
after
general
elections
a
top
bangladeshi
official
said
on
sunday
abul
kalam
bangladesh
s
refugee
relief
and
repatriation
commissioner
told
reuters
a
new
course
of
action
needed
to
be
adopted
on
repatriation
that
took
into
account
refugees
key
demands
he
later
clarified
these
were
his
own
personal
views
and
not
those
of
the
government
more
than
rohingya
fled
a
sweeping
army
crackdown
in
myanmar
s
rakhine
state
in
according
to
agencies
the
crackdown
was
launched
in
response
to
insurgent
rohingya
attacks
on
security
forces
rohingya
refugees
say
soldiers
and
buddhist
civilians
killed
families
burned
many
villages
and
carried
out
gang
rapes
investigators
have
accused
myanmar
s
army
of
genocidal
intent
and
ethnic
cleansing
myanmar
has
denied
almost
all
the
accusations
saying
its
forces
engaged
in
a
operation
against
terrorists
in
late
october
bangladesh
and
myanmar
agreed
to
begin
to
repatriate
hundreds
of
thousands
of
rohingya
muslim
refugees
who
fled
but
the
plan
has
been
opposed
by
the
rohingya
refugees
in
bangladesh
and
the
refugee
agency
and
aid
groups
who
fear
for
the
safety
of
rohingya
in
myanmar
the
repatriation
of
the
first
batch
of
refugees
was
to
begin
officially
on
but
it
stalled
amid
protests
at
the
refugee
camps
none
of
those
on
the
list
agreed
to
return
if
their
demands
for
justice
citizenship
and
the
ability
to
go
back
to
their
original
villages
and
lands
were
not
met
i
don
t
think
anyone
s
agreeing
to
go
back
without
these
said
kalam
who
last
week
called
on
the
international
community
to
pressure
myanmar
to
accept
certain
logical
and
acceptable
demands
in
order
for
any
repatriation
to
take
place
myanmar
does
not
consider
the
rohingya
a
native
ethnic
group
and
calls
them
bengalis
suggesting
they
belong
in
bangladesh
it
has
agreed
to
take
the
rohingya
back
and
said
they
would
need
to
accept
the
national
verification
card
which
it
says
would
allow
rohingya
to
apply
for
citizenship
the
rohingya
reject
the
card
saying
it
brands
them
foreigners
kalam
said
he
believed
myanmar
needed
to
propose
a
clearer
path
to
citizenship
for
the
rohingya
if
any
returns
were
to
take
place
adding
he
would
raise
the
matter
at
the
next
bilateral
meeting
on
repatriation
likely
to
take
place
next
month
myanmar
government
spokesman
zaw
htay
was
not
reachable
on
sunday
for
comment
with
bangladesh
now
set
to
go
to
the
polls
on
any
decision
either
to
repatriate
people
or
relocate
refugees
from
the
crowded
camps
to
bangladesh
s
bhasan
char
island
will
not
proceed
until
kalam
said
adding
later
a
final
decision
had
not
been
taken
and
it
would
be
the
government
s
call
elections
are
coming
up
now
so
the
government
will
only
finalise
a
future
course
of
action
after
the
elections
said
kalam
bangladesh
has
vowed
not
to
force
anyone
to
return
and
has
asked
the
high
commissioner
for
refugees
unhcr
to
ensure
those
to
return
really
want
to
go
back
a
unhcr
spokesman
said
it
was
not
clear
when
repatriations
could
begin
at
this
moment
it
s
unclear
perhaps
we
can
get
clarity
in
the
next
few
some
rohingya
refugee
leaders
in
bangladesh
said
they
were
relieved
bangladesh
had
not
forced
refugees
to
return
and
called
for
the
repatriation
plan
to
be
revised
kalam
said
construction
work
on
alternative
housing
on
bhasan
char
was
nearly
he
said
he
was
hopeful
some
refugees
would
agree
to
move
given
the
island
s
livelihood
opportunities
such
as
fishing
and
farming
aid
agencies
express
caution
as
the
island
is
prone
to
flooding
the
possibility
of
refugees
being
relocated
to
the
island
until
elections
are
over
is
slim
kalam
