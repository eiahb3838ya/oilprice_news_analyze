caracas
reuters
venezuela
s
top
military
envoy
to
the
united
states
defected
from
the
government
of
president
nicolas
maduro
on
saturday
as
the
south
american
nation
said
the
two
countries
had
scaled
back
their
diplomatic
missions
to
skeleton
staff
the
diplomatic
friction
and
defection
was
triggered
by
recognition
of
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
as
venezuela
s
interim
president
washington
canada
and
most
latin
american
nations
said
maduro
s
election
win
was
fraudulent
today
i
speak
to
the
people
of
venezuela
and
especially
to
my
brothers
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
nation
to
recognise
president
juan
guaido
as
the
only
legitimate
president
colonel
jose
luis
silva
said
in
a
video
recorded
at
the
embassy
in
washington
seated
at
a
desk
alongside
the
venezuelan
flag
silva
told
reuters
in
washington
that
one
consular
official
in
houston
and
one
in
another
city
also
recognised
guaido
but
that
he
was
the
only
diplomat
in
washington
he
knew
had
taken
the
step
reuters
was
not
able
to
independently
confirm
other
defectors
the
top
brass
of
the
military
and
the
executive
branch
are
holding
the
armed
forces
hostage
there
are
many
many
who
are
unhappy
silva
said
my
message
to
the
armed
forces
is
don
t
mistreat
your
we
were
given
arms
to
defend
the
sovereignty
of
our
nation
they
never
never
trained
us
to
say
this
is
for
you
to
attack
your
people
to
defend
the
current
government
in
while
small
rebellions
against
maduro
have
broken
out
in
venezuela
s
armed
forces
in
recent
months
there
has
been
no
large
scale
military
uprising
against
him
guaido
welcomed
silva
in
a
message
on
twitter
and
encouraged
others
to
follow
his
example
national
security
council
spokesman
garrett
marquis
called
the
defection
an
example
of
the
principle
that
the
role
of
the
military
is
to
protect
constitutional
order
not
to
sustain
dictators
and
repress
its
own
people
encourage
others
to
do
the
a
deadline
issued
by
maduro
for
embassy
personnel
to
leave
caracas
expired
on
saturday
after
the
embattled
socialist
leader
broke
off
bilateral
relations
on
wednesday
some
embassy
staff
left
caracas
on
friday
and
venezuela
was
withdrawing
staff
from
washington
on
saturday
venezuela
s
foreign
ministry
said
in
a
statement
however
maduro
softened
his
demand
that
all
embassy
staff
withdraw
by
saturday
instead
the
two
countries
will
seek
an
agreement
to
replace
the
embassies
with
interest
offices
in
their
respective
capitals
within
days
the
statement
said
for
decades
diplomacy
between
cuba
and
the
united
states
was
represented
by
an
interest
section
if
the
two
sides
fail
to
reach
an
agreement
the
remaining
diplomatic
staff
will
have
to
leave
and
the
missions
will
close
we
would
maintain
an
interests
office
with
minimum
personnel
and
office
of
representation
of
interests
as
functioned
in
cuba
that
is
true
diplomacy
maduro
said
on
a
live
broadcast
with
venezuelan
youth
we
don
t
want
to
be
a
north
american
colony
he
sang
during
the
broadcast
during
which
he
also
pounded
conga
drums
for
now
the
remaining
staff
can
only
carry
out
their
activities
within
the
diplomatic
missions
the
statement
said
the
state
department
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
the
status
of
the
embassy
