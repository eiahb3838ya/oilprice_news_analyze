the
shift

political
upheaval
remains
with
may
s
minority
government
facing
a
series
of
moments
in
the
brexit
process
over
coming
months
she
must
find
a
way
to
strike
a
deal
with
the
eu
which
has
already
rejected
her
preferred
plan
on
trade
then
sell
that
deal
to
her
deeply
divided
conservative
party
before
putting
it
to
a
vote
in
parliament
failure
at
any
of
those
three
hurdles

cost
her
