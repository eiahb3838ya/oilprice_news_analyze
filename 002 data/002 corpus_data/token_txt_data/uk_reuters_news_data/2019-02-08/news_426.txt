russia must scrap or alter missiles u.s. says violate arms treaty
washington
reuters
russia
must
scrap
its
cruise
missiles
and
launchers
or
modify
the
weapons
range
to
return
to
compliance
with
a
key
cold
arms
control
treaty
and
avert
a
pullout
from
the
pact
a
senior
official
said
thursday
either
you
rid
the
system
rid
the
launcher
or
change
the
system
where
it
doesn
t
exceed
the
range
in
a
verifiable
manner
said
under
secretary
of
state
for
arms
control
and
international
security
andrea
thompson
on
tuesday
the
united
states
announced
it
was
giving
russia
days
to
end
what
washington
charges
is
the
missiles
violation
of
the
nuclear
forces
treaty
or
it
would
begin
to
withdraw
from
the
pact
the
possibility
that
the
treaty
might
unravel
alarms
washington
s
european
allies
who
fear
its
collapse
would
trigger
a
new
nuclear
weapons
race
with
the
danger
that
europe
itself
could
become
a
nuclear
battleground
ambassador
to
russia
jon
huntsman
who
briefed
reporters
with
thompson
said
that
a
withdrawal
from
the
treaty
does
not
mean
we
are
walking
away
from
arms
we
remain
committed
to
arms
control
but
we
need
a
reliable
partner
and
do
not
have
one
in
russia
on
inf
or
for
that
matter
on
other
treaties
that
it
s
violating
huntsman
said
sounding
a
similar
theme
on
thursday
at
a
washington
post
event
the
top
military
commander
warned
that
russia
s
continued
breach
of
the
inf
pact
could
hamper
extending
the
new
start
treaty
which
limits
and
russian
offensive
nuclear
weapons
deployments
beyond
its
expiration
i
will
not
obviously
not
make
this
decision
i
ll
make
recommendations
said
marine
general
joseph
dunford
the
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
but
it
s
very
difficult
for
me
to
envision
progress
in
extending
new
start
if
the
foundation
of
that
is
with
the
inf
unless
the
sides
agree
on
a
extension
provided
by
the
pact
new
start
s
expiration
will
end
all
restrictions
on
their
deployments
of
offensive
nuclear
weapons

president

on
said
