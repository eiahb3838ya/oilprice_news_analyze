the
world
court
ordered
the
united
states
on
wednesday
to
ensure
that
sanctions
against
iran
due
to
be
tightened
next
month
do
not
affect
humanitarian
aid
or
civil
aviation
safety
judges
at
the
international
court
of
justice
icj
handed
a
small
victory
to
tehran
which
had
argued
that
sanctions
imposed
since
may
by
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
violate
terms
of
a
treaty
of
amity
between
the
two
countries
but
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
rejected
the
decision
he
said
the
united
nations
court
often
called
the
world
court
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
sanctions
which
pompeo
said
were
essential
to
security
interests
and
that
washington
would
terminate
the
treaty
with
iran
this
is
a
decision
frankly
that
is
years
overdue
pompeo
told
a
news
conference
iran
is
abusing
the
icj
for
political
and
propaganda
purposes
and
their
case
as
you
can
see
from
the
decision
lacked
pompeo
said
the
united
states
had
already
taken
steps
to
ensure
that
the
sanctions
which
it
intends
to
tighten
next
month
do
not
impact
humanitarian
aid
regardless
of
the
court
s
ruling
the
court
order
issued
on
wednesday
was
temporary
pending
a
resolution
of
iran
s
full
lawsuit
against
washington
at
the
icj
something
that
could
take
years
iran
s
foreign
ministry
said
in
a
statement
the
decision
proved
once
again
that
the
islamic
republic
is
right
and
the
sanctions
against
people
and
citizens
of
our
country
are
illegal
and
cruel
the
united
states
must
comply
with
its
international
commitments
and
lift
obstacles
to
iranian
trade
it
added
the
icj
is
the
united
nations
highest
court
for
resolving
disputes
between
nations
its
rulings
are
binding
but
it
has
no
power
to
enforce
them
and
both
the
united
states
and
iran
have
ignored
them
in
the
past
the
court
said
assurances
offered
by
washington
to
ensure
sanctions
do
not
affect
humanitarian
conditions
were
not
adequate
the
court
considers
that
the
united
states
must
by
means
of
its
choosing
any
impediment
arising
from
the
measures
announced
on
may
said
presiding
judge
abdulqawi
yusuf
reading
a
summary
of
a
ruling
by
the
panel
of
justices
the
sanctions
may
not
hurt
exportation
to
the
territory
of
iran
of
goods
required
for
humanitarian
needs
such
as
medicines
medical
devices
and
foodstuffs
and
agricultural
commodities
as
well
as
goods
and
services
required
for
the
safety
of
civil
aviation
he
said
while
sanctions
in
principle
exempt
food
and
medical
supplies
the
court
said
it
has
become
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
iran
iranian
nationals
and
companies
to
engage
in
international
financial
transactions
to
purchase
such
goods
the
trump
administration
argued
last
month
that
iran
s
request
was
an
attempt
to
misuse
the
court
and
that
the
treaty
specifically
ruled
out
using
courts
to
resolve
disputes
the
treaty
was
signed
long
before
iran
s
islamic
revolution
which
ended
friendly
relations
between
the
countries
state
department
legal
adviser
jennifer
newstead
had
said
iran
s
real
quarrel
was
its
frustration
over
the
pullout
from
the
nuclear
pact
under
which
tehran
restricted
its
disputed
uranium
enrichment
programme
under
monitoring
in
exchange
for
a
lifting
of
most
international
sanctions
trump
s
unilateral
move
has
put
it
at
odds
with
the
other
signatories
to
the
deal
including
washington
s
close
european
allies
britain
france
and
germany
as
well
as
russia
and
china
washington
nonetheless
plans
to
pursue
a
new
series
of
sanctions
due
to
go
into
effect
aimed
at
curtailing
iranian
oil
exports
the
lifeblood
of
its
economy
