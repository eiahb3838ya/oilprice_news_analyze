reuters
since
president
donald
trump
made
his
debut
at
the
united
nations
a
year
ago
pushing
an
america
first
policy
he
has
quit
the
iran
nuclear
deal
the
human
rights
council
and
lashed
out
at
some
of
the
closest
allies
of
the
united
states
next
week
at
the
united
nations
trump
plans
to
stay
on
message
touting
his
drive
to
protect
sovereignty
before
world
leaders
some
of
them
worried
about
america
s
commitment
to
the
multilateralism
that
has
governed
the
united
nations
since
the
end
of
world
war
two
it
is
not
saying
multilateralism
can
t
work
but
it
s
saying
sovereignty
is
a
priority
over
all
of
that
ambassador
to
the
united
nations
nikki
haley
said
previewing
trump
s
address
on
tuesday
at
the
annual
general
assembly
all
of
these
things
that
we
felt
like
were
mandating
things
on
the
united
states
those
aren
t
things
we
want
to
be
involved
in
she
said
citing
the
paris
climate
agreement
trump
pulled
out
of
in
and
global
talks
on
a
migration
pact
that
washington
quit
before
they
started
in
the
past
year
the
united
states
has
also
left
the
cultural
agency
cut
funding
for
the
agency
that
helps
palestinian
refugees
and
sparked
a
trade
war
with
china
at
a
nato
summit
in
july
trump
threatened
that
the
united
states
would
go
its
own
way
if
members
did
not
spend
more
on
defence
trump
is
now
surrounded
by
hawkish
advisers
more
in
tune
with
his
world
view
such
as
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
and
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
after
the
departure
of
their
predecessors
rex
tillerson
and
mcmaster
along
with
former
white
house
economic
adviser
gary
cohn
while
some
leaders
and
diplomats
have
voiced
concern
about
the
future
of
multilateralism
since
trump
took
office
in
january
last
year
they
rarely
name
and
shame
i
don
t
like
to
personalize
things
antonio
guterres
told
reporters
this
week
when
asked
if
trump
was
a
threat
to
multilateralism
in
different
areas
and
for
different
reasons
the
trust
of
people
in
their
political
establishments
the
trust
of
states
among
each
other
the
trust
of
many
people
in
international
organizations
has
been
eroded
he
said
multilateralism
has
been
under
fire
and
so
this
is
a
haley
said
trump
would
lay
down
a
marker
on
foreign
aid
while
the
is
generous
we
re
going
to
be
generous
to
those
that
share
our
values
generous
to
those
that
want
to
work
with
us
and
not
those
that
try
and
stop
the
or
say
they
hate
america
and
are
counterproductive
she
said
trump
has
long
been
sceptical
of
the
value
of
the
united
nations
though
haley
told
reuters
that
she
has
shown
him
the
world
body
s
worth
by
pushing
the
security
council
several
times
to
toughen
sanctions
on
north
korea
the
trump
administration
now
has
its
sights
on
iran
but
a
bid
by
washington
to
use
the
united
nations
to
call
out
tehran
over
accusations
of
meddling
in
the
middle
east
has
failed
in
may
trump
pulled
washington
out
of
a
international
agreement
to
put
controls
on
tehran
s
nuclear
programme
trump
is
set
to
chair
a
security
council
meeting
on
nonproliferation
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
on
wednesday
that
will
allow
him
to
attack
iran
and
flaunt
the
latest
developments
in
his
attempt
to
get
north
korea
to
denuclearize
trump
touted
his
role
in
a
post
on
twitter
on
friday
writing
i
will
chair
the
united
nations
security
council
meeting
on
iran
next
week
a
senior
diplomat
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
described
the
approach
of
the
trump
administration
to
several
foreign
policy
issues
during
the
past
year
as
if
you
want
things
to
change
you
ve
got
to
cause
throw
the
pieces
up
in
the
air
and
see
where
they
land
and
the
president
is
quite
masterful
at
claiming
victory
even
if
the
pieces
when
look
a
lot
like
the
pieces
did
before
they
were
thrown
up
in
the
air
the
diplomat
said
one
such
issue
say
diplomats
is
north
korea

drew
gasps
by
threatening
from
the
podium
to
totally
destroy
north
korea
now
he
is
talking
to
leader
kim
jong
un
while
there
have
been
some
gestures
of
