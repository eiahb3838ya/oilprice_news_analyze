the

said
last

the

two
thirds
of
employers
surveyed
by
sigmar
and
accounting
firm
ey
earlier
this
year
said
they
expected
to
give
staff
a
pay
rise
in
order
to
stop
poaching
by
rivals
a
practice
already
accounting
for

in

reached

by

around
a
fifth

being
filled
from

and
more
employers
were
also
offering
flexible

to
help
seal
the
deal
andrew
crawford
head
of
experis
ireland
said
applicants
were
coming
from
as
far
afield
as
australia
and
the
united
states
after
many
had
left
following
the
financial
crisis
ireland
s
economy
has
grown
faster
than
any
other
in
the
european
union
for
the
last
four
years
and
is
forecast
to
expand
by
percent
in
against
percent
for
the
region
the
central
bank
last
week
said
that
fast
growth
could
lead
to
full
capacity
in
the
economy
with
a
risk
it
overheats
and
creates
a
cycle
but
brexit
also
brings
with
it
some
uncertainty
for
ireland
the
central
bank
estimates
that
if
neighboring
britain
leaves
the
eu
without
a
formal
divorce
agreement
in
march
it
would
shave
percent
off
economic
growth
over
years
and
result
in
the
creation
of
around
fewer
jobs
an
economy
is
considered
at
its
limit
when
unemployment
is
so
low
that
rising
wages
push
up
prices
ireland
s
jobless
rate
has
dropped
sharply
in
recent
months
to
percent
in
part
due
to
hiring
at
fund
managers
insurers
and
banks
irish
business
lobby
ibec
said
it
has
also
seen
steep
pay
rises
for
specialist
positions
in
other
areas
such
as
ireland
s
large
pharmaceutical
and
medical
device
sectors
and
for
it
roles
in
retail
that
was
due
to
faster
growth
rather
than
brexit
however
for
those
hiring
the
wage
rises
can
also
bring
problems
macgiolla
phadraig
said
he
was
worried
about
the
effect
of
defensive
pay
hikes
on
the
competitiveness
of
the
economy
which
relies
on
foreign
firms
for
almost
one
in
ten
jobs
the
indicators
are
honestly
quite
worrying
he
said
estelle
davis
managing
partner
at
brightwater
executive
said
she
had
seen
a
percent
rise
in
financial
services
job
vacancies
with
almost
a
quarter
of
senior
roles
placed
in
the
second
half
of
directly
attributed
to
brexit
the
buoyant
economy
and
attractive
market
outlook
was
also
encouraging
irish
workers
to
move
back
home
she
said
particularly
for
more
experienced
hires
someone
who
has
years
plus
senior
management
experience
under
their
belt
returnees
commanding
higher
wages
nevertheless
have
to
dig
a
little
deeper
to
find
a
place
to
live
as
property
prices
both
commercial
and
residential
heat
up
while
average
house
prices
are
still
percent
below
their
property
bubble
peak
they
rose
percent
in
dublin
in
the
year
to
residential
rents
have
already
passed
the
previous
peak
that
said
mark
o
donnell
a
partner
working
in
financial
services
in
the
dublin
office
of
odgers
was
the
biggest
impediment
for
some
financial
services
firms
rents
have
and
this
has
already
put
off
potential
