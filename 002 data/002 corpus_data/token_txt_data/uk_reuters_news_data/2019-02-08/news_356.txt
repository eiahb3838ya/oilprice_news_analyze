france
will
deploy
tens
of
thousands
of
police
nationwide
and
around
in
paris
on
saturday
to
handle
a
fifth
weekend
of
yellow
vest
protests
although
the
movement
appears
to
be
losing
steam
after
concessions
by
president
emmanuel
macron
the
chief
of
police
in
paris
said
concerns
remained
about
violent
groups
infiltrating
the
protests
officers
will
protect
landmarks
such
as
the
arc
de
triomphe
and
prevent
people
getting
close
to
the
presidential
palace
we
need
to
be
prepared
for
scenarios
police
chief
michel
delpuech
told
rtl
radio
he
expected
businesses
in
the
capital
to
be
less
affected
this
weekend
after
heavy
disruption
over
the
past
three
weeks
when
major
stores
shut
hotels
suffered
cancellations
and
tourists
stayed
away
during
the
usually
busy
to
christmas
nicknamed
acte
v
of
the
protests
the
yellow
vest
demonstrators
will
take
to
the
streets
this
weekend
as
france
recovers
from
an
unrelated
attack
on
a
christmas
market
in
the
eastern
city
of
strasbourg
on
tuesday
when
a
gunman
shot
and
killed
three
people
and
wounded
several
others
hundreds
of
police
officers
were
redeployed
to
strasbourg
to
search
for
the
gunman
who
was
shot
dead
in
an
exchange
of
fire
on
thursday
evening
interior
minister
christophe
castaner
said
it
was
time
for
the
yellow
vests
to
scale
down
their
protests
and
accept
they
had
achieved
their
aims
police
officers
also
deserved
a
break
he
added
i
d
rather
have
the
police
force
doing
their
real
job
chasing
criminals
and
combating
the
terrorism
threat
instead
of
securing
roundabouts
where
a
few
thousand
people
keep
a
lot
of
police
busy
he
said
graphic
yellow
vests
in
france
attractions
such
as
the
louvre
museum
and
opera
garnier
will
be
open
this
weekend
as
will
luxury
department
stores
like
galeries
lafayette
and
printemps
last
saturday
they
were
closed
as
thousands
of
sometimes
violent
protesters
tore
through
the
city
the
previous
weekend
the
arc
de
triomphe
was
vandalised
cars
were
overturned
and
torched
and
businesses
smashed
up
the
protests
have
taken
a
toll
on
the
economy
with
output
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
year
set
to
be
half
initial
projections
while
macron
s
concessions
are
likely
to
push
the
budget
deficit
above
an
eu
agreed
limit
the
yellow
vest
movement
which
began
as
a
protest
against
fuel
taxes
and
then
grew
into
an
alliance
appears
to
have
calmed
since
the
president
announced
a
series
of
measures
to
help
the
working
poor
however
many
people
wearing
the
motorists
safety
jackets
which
are
the
symbol
of
the
protests
were
manning
barricades
outside
cities
on
friday
after
heavy
criticism
for
not
being
seen
to
respond
to
the
protesters
complaints
macron
made
a
tv
address
this
week
during
which
he
said
he
understood
their
concerns
and
acknowledged
the
need
for
a
different
approach
as
well
cancelling
fuel
tax
increases
that
were
due
to
kick
in
next
month
macron
said
he
would
increase
the
minimum
wage
by
euros
a
month
from
january
and
reduce
taxes
for
poorer
pensioners
among
other
measures
since
the
first
yellow
vest
protests
on
supporters
have
kept
up
a
steady
stream
of
dissent
although
the
numbers
joining
marches
have
steadily
fallen
