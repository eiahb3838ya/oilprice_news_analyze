ftse rides out trade war tit-for-tat
reuters
britain
s
top
share
index
barely
budged
on
tuesday
as
investors
took
in
their
stride
an
escalation
in
the
trade
and
losses
among
tobacco
stocks
were
balanced
by
gains
in
miners
and
oil
companies
the
ftse
ended
the
day
down
percent
while
rose
percent
tracking
higher
european
markets
after
washington
decided
to
slap

tariffs
on
another
billion
of
chinese
goods
and
beijing
retaliated
beijing
s
retaliation
was
less
harsh
than
feared
and
caused
just
a
temporary
blip
in
stock
markets
which
recovered

mark
haefele
chief
investment
officer
at
ubs
wealth
management
said
in
a
note
a
round
of
retaliation
would
likely
be
taken
positively
by
the
market
reducing
the
risk
of
a
significant
escalation
in
the
the
ftse
remains
down
percent
so
far
this
year
however
as
a
recovery
in
sterling
on
growing
expectations
of
a
brexit
deal
has
weighed
on
the
index
the
biggest
drag
on
the
ftse
on
tuesday
was
tobacco
firm
bat
which
fell
percent
after
morgan
stanley
started
covering
the
stock
with
an
rating
its
rival
imperial
brands
also
fell
percent
at
these
low
levels
at
this

valuation
after
this
period
of
underperformance
bat
should
be
a
buy
it
certainly
ticks
a
lot
of
boxes
however
a
combination
of
new
challenges
and
some
familiar
ones
leaves
us
on
the
sidelines
said
an
analyst
at
the
investment
bank
serviced
offices
provider
iwg
fell
percent
after
credit
suisse
analysts
downgraded
the
stock
to
underperform
from
neutral
citing
risks
to
earnings
from
the
implementation
of
new
accounting
standards
and
the
departure
of

after
its
ceo
declined
to
say
whether
it

ocado
rose
percent
after
the
online
supermarket
said
retail
sales
growth
slowed
a
touch
in
the
latest
quarter
though
it
was
in
line
with
the
group
s
guidance
for
the
full
year
as
commerce
migrates
online
the
winners
will
be
those
with
access
to
advanced

their

our

is
that
this

so
