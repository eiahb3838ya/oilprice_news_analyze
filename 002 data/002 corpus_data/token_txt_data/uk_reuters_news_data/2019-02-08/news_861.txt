after
suffering
months
of
capital
outflows
policy
makers
from
emerging
markets
attending
bank
meetings
in
indonesia
had
a
message
for
leading
economies
current
monetary
and
trade
policies
risk
undermining
us
all
the
international
monetary
bank
meetings
wrapping
up
on
sunday
gave
central
bankers
and
finance
ministers
from
around
the
world
a
chance
to
meet
in
indonesia
whose
rupiah
currency
hit
a
new
low
this
week
poorer
and
populous
emerging
markets
have
been
particularly
vulnerable
to
the
escalating
tariff
war
and
rate
rises
by
the
central
bank
investors
dumped
assets
seen
as
riskier
sparking
painful
currency
plunges
that
have
punished
countries
from
india
to
south
africa
as
well
as
triggering
crises
in
turkey
and
argentina
we
are
all
aware
that
the
normalisation
of
the
monetary
policy
in
the
combined
with
their
fiscal
policy
and
trade
policy
are
all
creating
a
systemic
impact
to
the
whole
economy
in
the
world
indonesian
finance
minister
sri
mulyani
indrawati
said
in
an
interview
during
the
meetings
in
bali
the
federal
reserve
s
nearly
tightening
cycle
has
in
part
prompted
a
global
shift
in
capital
away
from
emerging
markets
and
after
three
hikes
this
year
it
foresees
another
december
rise
three
more
next
year
and
one
in
a
senior
fed
official
in
bali
said
the
rate
rises
were
right
for
domestic
policy
and
ensuring
they
were
gradual
and
predictable
was
the
best
solution
for
minimising
unintended
volatility
in
emerging
markets
in
a
bid
to
support
the
rupiah
bank
indonesia
has
raised
rates
five
times
since
and
intervened
regularly
but
still
the
currency
has
lost
nearly
percent
this
year
leaving
it
at
the
weakest
levels
since
the
asian
financial
crisis
bank
indonesia
governor
perry
warjiyo
said
that
the
basis
point
rate
hikes
since
aimed
to
keep
indonesian
assets
attractive
enough
for
foreigners
to
stay
invested
but
calibrating
this
in
the
current
environment
was
hard
the
risk
premia
are
very
difficult
to
incorporate
because
risk
premia
are
responding
to
geopolitical
responding
to
trade
tension
warjiyo
told
a
panel
in
bali
finance
ministers
for
developing
nations
in
the
group
of
economies
urged
major
economies
to
reform
the
global
trading
system
rather
than
discard
it
the
statement
issued
on
the
sidelines
of
the
bali
meetings
said
all
emerging
markets
were
adversely
affected
by
excessive
capital
flow
volatility
while
many
countries
shared
common
fears
indrawati
said
it
was
difficult
to
forge
cooperation
to
counter
the
risks
it
s
not
really
clear
how
the
world
is
going
to
coordinate
more
effectively
especially
when
each
country
has
their
own
domestic
issues
she
said
the
philippine
peso
has
shed
nearly
percent
this
year
and
its
deputy
central
bank
governor
diwa
guinigundo
said
the
imf
and
other
global
institutions
should
advise
advanced
economies
on
the
potential
negative
consequences
of
their
moves
it
s
the
spillovers
that
we
are
concerned
with
the
spillover
could
have
effects
from
one
market
to
the
other
from
the
financial
market
to
the
real
market
said
guinigundo
he
said
while
it
was
good
for
policymakers
to
be
ahead
of
the
curve
in
tightening
they
should
take
account
of
the
growing
clout
of
emerging
markets
it
should
also
be
emphasized
that
china
japan
korea
we
account
for
a
good
bulk
of
the
world
s
population
and
imf
managing
director
christine
lagarde
urged
members
at
the
meeting
to
trade
tensions
and
work
on
fixing
global
trade
rules
she
also
warned
against
adding
currency
to
the
trade
conflict
saying
this
would
hurt
global
growth
as
well
as
innocent
bystander
nations
including
emerging
markets
that
supply
commodities
to
china
egyptian
finance
minister
mohamed
maait
said
policy
makers
in
developed
countries
should
understand
that
if
their
actions
hurt
other
countries
it
would
have
effects
you
need
me
i
am
a
market
for
you
i
am
an
opportunity
for
you
maait
told
reuters
i
don
t
believe
there
will
be
a
winner
and
a
loser
either
all
are
winners
or
all
are
indeed
market
ructions
have
now
cascaded
through
to
developed
markets
with
wall
street
seeing
a
six
session
slide
until
a
rebound
on
friday
amid
fears
over
the
trade
war
between
china
and
the
united
states
however
other
than
having
effective
monetary
policies
developing
markets
can
do
little
to
cope
with
the
impact
of
rate
hikes
and
trade
battles
