it started with a kiss - how juncker wooed trump
brussels
reuters
some
personal
chemistry
with
a
fellow
veteran
dealmaker
and
a
quick
sense
that
donald
trump
was
ready
to
bargain
helped
juncker
strike
a
surprise
accord
to
avert
a
transatlantic
trade
war
for
now
that
is
the
view
of
european
commission
officials
familiar
with
the
eu
chief
executive
s
meeting
at
the
white
house
on
wednesday
after
which
the
president
declared
there
was
love
between
the
two
sides
and
withdrew
a
threat
to
slap
new
tariffs
on
eu
cars
that
would
have
drawn
retaliation
in
europe
clearly
there
is
a
good
chemistry
between
president
juncker
and
president
trump
it
helps
one
eu
official
who
was
present
said
the
human
dimension
is
of
crucial
juncker
criticised
trump
notably
at
a
summit
last
month
but
he
went
into
the
white
house
showdown
oozing
charm
trump
tweeted
a
photograph
of
juncker
giving
him
a
trademark
kiss
he
also
gave
him
a
picture
of
the
grave
in
his
native
luxembourg
of
one
of
trump
s
heroes
barnstorming
world
war
two
general
george
patton
with
a
note
reminding
dear
donald
of
a
shared
history
juncker
has
been
tough
on
trump
in
the
past
and
trump
respects
that
said
another
eu
official
on
returning
to
brussels
on
thursday
you
could
tell
from
the
atmosphere
from
the
start
that
trump
was
interested
in
doing
a
that
deal
was
twofold
to
face
down
trump
by
waving
a
threat
of
europe
s
own
to
curb
access
to
the
world
s
biggest
market
and
to
present
mostly
old
and
effectively
eu
offers
as
something
trump
could
sell
to
voters
ahead
of
november
elections
new
talks
on
lowering
eu
tariffs
for
industrial
goods
outlets
for
gas
and
soybeans
and
potential
eu
backing
in
trade
rows
with
china
the
eu
delegation
which
had
been
playing
down
expectations
confessed
to
some
surprise
at
how
well
it
worked
surmising
that
trump
assailed
at
home
on
a
range
of
issues
saw
advantage
in
how
an
eu
deal
could
be
sold
compared
to
a
bigger
trade
war
juncker
himself
told
the
politico
news
website
we
get
along
well
surprisingly
and
adding
that
trump
took
past
criticism
well
he
doesn
t
like
those
who
beat
about
the
the
two
have
very
different
backgrounds
juncker
has
worked
in
politics
all
his
life
most
of
it
at
the
top
table
of
eu
backroom
bargaining
as
finance
minister
and
prime
minister
of
luxembourg
trump
the
real
estate
baron
and
reality
tv
star
held
no
office
before
his
extraordinary
election
in
yet
both
like
to
be
seen
as
dealmakers
in
their
different
ways
and
juncker
will
relish
the
praise
heaped
on
him
notably
by
relieved
german
exporters
for
what
his
team
concede
may
only
be
a
truce
while
trump
engages
in
talks
before
any
action
juncker
knows
how
to
tame
trump
wrote
vienna
s
der
standard
describing
the
deal
as
a
masterpiece
the
old
fox
showed
that
even
from
the
most
difficult
of
political
situations
he
can
find
a
diplomatic
way
it
is
a
far
cry
from
two
weeks
ago
when
some
germans
were
questioning
his
fitness
for
the
job
after
he
was
seen
staggering
due
to
sciatica
he
insisted
not
alcohol
during
a
nato
summit
where
trump
was
busy
trashing
his
european
allies
a
lot
of
love
went
into
their
preparations
a
brussels
diplomat
from
one
eu
member
states
said
of
how
the
commission
in
one
of
the
biggest
tasks
the
eu
executive
has
undertaken
on
behalf
of
its
member
governments
worked
out
its
trump
plan
in
saying
the
eu
would
import
more
gas
juncker
was
able
to
surprise
the
president
two
eu
officials
said
by
telling
him
it
was
bureaucracy
over
export
licences
that
was
partly
holding
back
sales
in
any
case
it
is
part
of
a
eu
plan
to
diversify
away
from
russia
gas
and
can
not
happen
quickly
as
special
terminals
still
have
to
be
built
in
saying
soybean
imports
would
also
rise
juncker
was
effectively
just
reflecting
market
conditions
as
chinese
curbs
have
driven
down
the
price
of
soy
making
it
attractive
to
european
farmers
who
use
it
in
animal
feed
as
well
as
carrots
though
juncker
also
had
a
big
stick
i
think
they
weighed
what
it
would
mean
to
open
up
a
billion
euro
trade
nightmare
a
third
eu
official
said
in
trying
to
explain
how
juncker
succeeded
where
others
notably
in
asia
had
failed
they
wouldn
t
know
how
this
would
