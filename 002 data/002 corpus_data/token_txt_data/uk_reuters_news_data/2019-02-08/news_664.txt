hopes
he
can
work
with

as
well
as
possibly
addressing
the
thousands
of
young
immigrants
living
in
the
united
states
without
legal
status
speaking
to
reporters
at
the

said
he
wanted
to
see
lawmakers
provide
enough
money
to
build
his
wall
along
the
southern
border
with
mexico
but
he
said
he
would
not
necessarily
force
a
government
shutdown
over
the

need
the

to
build
the

not
pieces

need
the
wall
many
democrats
know
we
need
the

have
to
see

really
do
something

ll
see
how
it
works
