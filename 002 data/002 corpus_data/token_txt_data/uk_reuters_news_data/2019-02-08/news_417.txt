if

selling
more

than
the
region
needs
making

a
tinderbox
president
donald
trump
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
a
multilateral
nuclear
deal
with
iran
in
may
and
reimposed
sanctions
on
iran
s
vital
oil
industry
last
month
drug
trafficking
is
a
serious
challenge
for
iran
as
it
borders
afghanistan
the
world
s
largest
opium
producer
and
pakistan
a
major
transit
country
for
drugs
we
spend
million
a
year
to
fight
drugs
which
ensures
the
health
of
nations
stretching
from
of
eastern
europe
to
the
american
west
and
north
africa
to
west
asia
imagine
what
a
disaster
there
would
be
if
there
is
a
breach
in
the
dam

said
in
iran
accounted
for
two
thirds
of
the
world
s
opium
seizures
and
one
fourth
of
the
world
s
heroin
and
morphine
seizures
a
report
published
in
showed
we
have
been
just
as
determined
in
the
fight
against
terrorism
sacrificing
hundreds
of
valuable
troops
and
spending
millions
of
dollars
annually
rouhani
said
we
don
t
expect
the
west
to
pay
their
share
but
they
should
know
that
sanctions
hurt
iran
s
capacity
to
fight
drugs
and
terrorism
rouhani
added
iran
a
key
supporter
of
president
bashar
in
syria
s
civil
war
has
sent
military
advisers
as
well
as
materiel
and
regional
shi
ite
militias
to
fight
militant
groups
in
iraq
militias
and
their
iranian
advisers
helped
iraq
defeat
islamic
state
economic
terrorism
means
creating
horror
in
a
country
and
create
fear
in
other
countries
that
intend
to
invest
there
america
s
withdrawal
from
the
nuclear
accord
is
undoubtedly
a
clear
example
of
economic
terrorism
rouhani
told
a
meeting
of
heads
of
parliaments
of
china
russia
and
four
other
countries
more
than
undocumented
afghans
have
returned
from
iran
this
year
as
the
iranian
economy
tightens
according
to
data
from
the
s
migration
agency
and
iranian
media
said
some
afghans
were
seeking
to
enter
turkey
to
reach
europe
zarif
warned
about
the
dangers
of
large
arms
sales
in
the
middle
east
where
iran
s
regional
rival
saudi
arabia
is
a
major
buyer
of
western
weapons
the
americans
have
turned
the
region
into
a
tinderbox
the
level
of
arms
sales
by
the
americans
is
unbelievable
and
much
beyond
regional
needs
and
this
points
to
the
very
dangerous
policies
followed
by
the
americans
