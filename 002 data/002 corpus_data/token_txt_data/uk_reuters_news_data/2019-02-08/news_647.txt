chance of no-deal brexit holds firm at one-in-four as clock ticks - reuters poll
london
reuters
with
less
than
five
months
left
before
britain
and
the
european
union
officially
part
ways
there
remains
a
chance
the
sides
fail
to
reach
a
deal
on
the
terms
of
departure
according
to
economists
polled
by
reuters
this
week
the
eu
would
have
to
see
a
breakthrough
on
brexit
within
a
week
if
its
leaders
are
to
endorse
any
deal
with
britain
this
month
several
official
and
diplomatic
sources
in
brussels
told
reuters
on
wednesday
britain
s
land
border
with
ireland
has
proved
a
major
stumbling
block
between
the
two
sides
and
with
time
running
out
to
reach
a
resolution
the
chance
of
no
deal
being
agreed
by
march
when
the
two
sides
are
due
to
divorce
has
held
steady
at
october
s
percent
it
has
been
between
and
percent
since
reuters
began
asking
in
july
forecasts
in
the
latest
poll
ranged
from
to
percent
both
sides
have
every
incentive
to
ensure
that
the
uk
does
not
leave
the
eu
in
a
disorderly
fashion
in
march
said
peter
dixon
at
commerzbank
if
prime
minister
theresa
may
fails
to
reach
agreement
with
brussels
or
parliament
votes
it
down
then
britain
faces
leaving
the
eu
without
a
divorce
deal
and
thus
without
a
transition
period
leading
to
economic
disruption
britain
and
the
eu
are
in
the
closing
stages
of
talks
british
interior
minister
sajid
javid
said
on
thursday
but
ireland
s
foreign
minister
tried
to
dampen
expectations
a
brexit
deal
might
be
imminent
the
risk
of
a
disorderly
brexit
is
rising
it
looks
to
be
theresa
may
s
strategy
to
postpone
decisions
until
everyone
has
its
back
against
the
wall
said
stefan
koopman
at
rabobank
this
is
a
very
risky
approach
as
the
complex
dynamics
in
the
uk
parliament
make
ratification
particularly
still
the
most
likely
eventual
relationship
is
they
settle
for
a
free
trade
agreement
as
has
been
predicted
since
reuters
first
began
polling
on
this
two
years
ago
in
second
place
was
leaving
without
an
agreement
and
trading
under
basic
world
trade
organization
rules
holding
in
third
was
britain
being
a
member
of
the
european
economic
area
paying
into
the
eu
budget
to
maintain
access
to
the
eu
s
single
market
again
least
likely
was
brexit
being
cancelled
no
respondent
pegged
this
as
most
likely
while
the
anticipated
recession
never
materialised
economic
growth
has
slowed
and
is
predicted
to
be
percent
this
year
the
poll
of
economists
found
incorporating
their
expectations
for
brexit
economists
consensus
forecast
is
for
growth
to
accelerate
to
percent
next
year
and
hold
there
in
still
slower
than
where
it
was
running
up
to
the
referendum
to
leave
the
eu
growth
forecasts
ranged
from
to
percent
the
economy
fared
better
than
expected
in
after
a
very
weak
first
quarter
but
momentum
was
slowed
by
weak
investment
amid
uncertainty
noted
economists
at
ubs
assuming
the
uk
and
eu
can
strike
a
withdrawal
agreement
and
that
parliament
ratifies
it
in
advance
of
the
deadline
that
uncertainty
will
be
alleviated
for
a
time
as
a
result
we
expect
gdp
to
when
asked
about
the
chance
of
a
recession
in
the
coming
year
economists
have
a
median
response
of
percent
barely
changed
from
last
month
when
asked
about
one
within
the
next
two
years
they
said
percent
inflation
jumped
in
the
wake
of
the
june
referendum
mostly
driven
by
a
fall
in
sterling
and
is
expected
to
hold
above
the
bank
of
england
s
percent
target
until
late
yet
as
a
deal
has
not
been
made
respondents
mostly
said
the
central
bank
would
wait
until
at
least
april
before
raising
borrowing
costs
by
basis
points
to
percent
policymakers
won
t
then
increase
them
again
until
early
when
they
will
add
another
basis
