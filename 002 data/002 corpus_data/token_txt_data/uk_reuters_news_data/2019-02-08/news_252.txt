eu looks at help for may, but will not rework brexit deal
brussels
reuters
the
european
union
is
considering
ways
to
help
prime
minister
theresa
may
convince
the
british
parliament
to
back
the
brexit
treaty
she
agreed
with
eu
leaders
last
month
but
ruled
out
on
monday
any
change
to
the
deal
eu
sources
told
reuters
that
senior
officials
in
brussels
are
discussing
whether
and
how
to
issue
reassurances
that
might
help
may
overcome
resistance
to
the
deal
before
lawmakers
vote
in
london
next
week
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
told
cnbc
he
hoped
the
eu
and
united
kingdom
could
find
a
way
to
avoid
negative
ramifications
from
a
hard
brexit
related
not
only
to
commerce
and
trade
but
importantly
to
the
national
security
issues
that
we
have
with
the
british
as
well
as
the
european
among
the
reassurances
eu
officials
were
considering
was
a
request
they
said
may
put
to
fellow
eu
leaders
at
a
summit
before
the
christmas
break
on
to
commit
to
having
a
new
free
trade
treaty
in
place
by
the
end
of
however
the
european
union
shows
no
sign
of
going
beyond
an
existing
aspiration
to
do
that
not
a
hard
promise
the
date
is
important
as
it
could
allow
may
to
assure
her
own
party
and
others
that
the
unpopular
irish
backstop
in
the
treaty
would
not
be
triggered
after
a
transition
period
ends
some
time
by
the
backstop
would
bind
britain
to
follow
eu
rules
to
avoid
a
hard
customs
border
across
the
island
of
ireland
unless
a
better
way
is
agreed
to
do
that
by
means
of
a
new
trade
pact
critics
of
may
s
deal
to
smooth
britain
s
passage
out
of
the
eu
on
march
say
the
backstop
could
leave
britain
subject
to
eu
rules
indefinitely
long
after
it
gives
up
any
say
over
them
eu
officials
familiar
with
the
discussions
said
they
saw
little
sign
of
any
shift
in
the
position
of
eu
leaders
last
month
when
they
said
the
agreement
could
not
be
renegotiated
and
they
would
make
no
binding
commitments
that
could
be
construed
as
altering
it
we
can
provide
reassurances
one
official
said
but
whatever
it
might
be
will
just
reiterate
the
summit
conclusions
from
last
among
ways
in
which
the
eu
could
offer
more
detail
and
clarity
on
its
agreed
position
officials
said
would
be
an
exchange
of
legal
letters
with
the
british
government
setting
out
expectations
of
when
a
trade
deal
could
be
completed
however
eu
leaders
are
wary
of
introducing
legal
ambiguity
if
the
language
of
any
statement
differs
from
the
original
text
the
eu
executive
repeated
on
monday
that
leaders
would
not
renegotiate
the
treaty
and
said
it
was
pressing
on
with
planning
for
britain
to
crash
out
of
the
union
without
a
deal
the
deal
that
is
on
the
table
is
the
best
and
the
only
deal
possible
the
european
commission
s
chief
spokesman
margaritis
schinas
told
reporters
when
asked
about
a
phone
conversation
on
friday
between
may
and
commission
president
juncker
this
deal
will
not
be
he
also
repeated
that
there
were
no
talks
planned
between
negotiators
from
the
two
sides
as
negotiations
are
complete
schinas
said
that
juncker
s
conversation
with
may
on
friday
was
friendly
and
that
the
two
would
speak
again
this
week
may
also
spoke
last
week
to
eu
summit
