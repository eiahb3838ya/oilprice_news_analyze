germany's maas - uk must spell out what backstop changes it wants
berlin
reuters
britain
must
spell
out
quickly
what
changes
it
envisages
to
the
irish
backstop
an
arrangement
to
avoid
a
hard
border
between
eu
member
ireland
and
northern
ireland
after
brexit
german
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
said
on
wednesday
britain
s
parliament
late
on
tuesday
instructed
prime
minister
theresa
may
to
seek
changes
from
the
european
union
in
the
negotiated
divorce
deal
which
includes
the
backstop
the
eu
has
repeatedly
said
the
deal
can
not
be
reopened
the
house
of
commons
the
lower
chamber
also
voted
late
on
tuesday
in
favour
of
an
amendment
ruling
out
a
brexit
though
that
measure
is
not
legally
binding
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
eu
on
march
it
is
important
that
the
british
lower
house
spoke
out
yesterday
against
a
disorderly
brexit
as
no
one
can
have
an
interest
in
that
maas
said
but
the
british
government
has
not
yet
said
what
changes
to
the
northern
ireland
backstop
it
envisages
it
must
now
say
quickly
what
it
wants
because
time
is
running
out
maas
added
we
are
ready
to
talk
our
position
is
clear
the
withdrawal
agreement
is
the
best
and
only
solution
for
an
orderly
the
comments
from
maas
a
leading
member
of
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
government
suggest
germany
could
be
open
to
fresh
talks
on
the
backstop
the
main
obstacle
to
concluding
the
brexit
divorce
deal
many
british
lawmakers
especially
in
may
s
governing
conservative
party
fear
the
backstop
will
trap
the
uk
in
a
permanent
customs
union
with
the
eu
after
brexit
ireland
and
the
rest
of
the
eu
say
there
is
no
credible
alternative
to
the
backstop
which
would
prevent
customs
and
other
checks
having
to
be
conducted
after
brexit
on
the
border
between
the
irish
republic
and
northern
ireland
on
the
backstop
germany
and
the
whole
european
union
stand
firmly
at
ireland
s
side
we
will
not
allow
ireland
to
be
isolated
on
this
issue
