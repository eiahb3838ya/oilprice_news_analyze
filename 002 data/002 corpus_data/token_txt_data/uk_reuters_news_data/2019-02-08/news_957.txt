londoners
fed
up
with
brexit
can
vent
their
rage
with
a
special
gym
routine
that
includes
exercises
like
pummelling
punchbags
bearing
photographs
of
some
of
the
main
players
like
boris
johnson
and
juncker
the
circuit
also
features
the
theresa
may
sack
race
jacob
lifts
and
politico
headslammer
in
which
participants
slam
balls
on
to
pictures
of
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
and
opposition
labour
party
leader
jeremy
corbyn
there
is
also
a
cameron
quitters
corner
named
after
may
s
predecessor
david
cameron
to
take
time
out
the
brexfit
classes
are
being
offered
by
fitness
company
gymbox
whose
boss
marc
diaper
said
the
theme
was
chosen
by
a
members
poll
of
their
main
frustrations
with
living
in
the
british
capital
fifty
two
percent
of
respondents
said
brexit
followed
by
rent
prices
and
train
delays
we
thought
well
what
better
way
to
actually
release
frustration
and
anger
than
actually
put
on
a
brexfit
class
as
we
ve
called
it
where
you
can
actually
punch
your
most
hated
politician
in
the
face
on
a
punch
bag
he
told
reuters
the
course
was
designed
with
the
help
of
an
anger
management
expert
said
fitness
instructor
boriss
visokoborskis
it
s
for
our
members
to
relieve
the
stress
caused
by
brexit
and
all
the
frustration
they
see
in
the
mass
media
and
internet
and
so
on
he
added
they
are
leaving
our
classes
feeling
relieved
lighter
and
they
do
something
good
for
themselves
they
work
on
their
student
ania
jarzabkiewicz
originally
from
poland
said
she
felt
amazing
after
the
class
i
have
a
problem
to
get
my
student
loan
because
of
brexit
so
today
i
really
take
out
my
frustration
on
this
whole
situation
and
i
feel
really
good
she
said
fitness
coach
george
said
his
favourite
exercises
were
the
sack
races
and
punch
bags
in
this
particular
class
leading
brexiteer
and
former
foreign
secretary
johnson
bore
the
brunt
of
his
frustration
it
d
be
wrong
to
punch
him
in
the
face
in
real
life
so
doing
it
on
a
punch
bag
there
s
nothing
wrong
with
that
and
it
s
definitely
a
great
way
to
get
your
frustration
out
he
said
with
six
months
until
britain
leaves
the
eu
may
has
yet
to
reach
a
deal
on
the
terms
of
the
divorce
and
her
plan
for
future
trade
ties
has
been
rebuffed
by
both
the
eu
and
many
in
her
own
conservative
party
corbyn
said
this
week
that
labour
would
vote
against
a
brexit
deal
based
on
may
s
proposals
the
strongest
warning
yet
to
a
prime
minister
whose
plan
to
leave
the
eu
is
hanging
by
a
thread
