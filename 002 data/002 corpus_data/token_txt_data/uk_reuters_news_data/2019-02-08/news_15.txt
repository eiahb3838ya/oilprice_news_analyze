wednesday
said
it
would
use
a
fund
to
receive
some
of
the

in
a
key
step
to
bankroll
its
efforts
to
dislodge

would
receive
income
accrued
by
oil

if
they
recognise
guaido
as
interim
leader
if
not
the
international
financial
circle
will
be
closed

completely
bolton
wrote
on

aside
from
one
senior
general
who
recognised
guaido
in
a
video
and
urged
others
in
the
military
to
do
the
same
most
of
venezuela
s
top
military
officers
have
not
defected
from
maduro
citgo
the
refiner
and
venezuela
s
top
foreign
asset
is
in
the
middle
of
a
tug
of
war
as
the
united
states
has
made
aggressive
moves
to
remove
it
from
maduro
s
control
and
imposed
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
oil
industry
this
is
already
quite
advanced
i
hope
that
next
week
it
can
be
announced
by
our
representative
in
the
united
states
paparoni
said
though
he
did
not
give
details
about
the
nature
of
the
fund
or
the
financial
institution
involved
pressure
is
building
on
maduro
a
socialist
to
resign
amid
an
economic
crisis
marked
by
widespread
shortages
and
hyperinflation
maduro
was
last
year
in
a
vote
critics
have
called
a
sham
yon

a
member
of
guaido
s
policy
team
told
reuters
that
guaido
was
in
contact
with
pdvsa
s
international
partners
and
they
were
willing
to
keep
operating
in
venezuela
he
did
not
identify
the
partners

s
team
is
planning
for
a
government
with
an
emergency
arrangement
to
supply
fuel
domestically
given
widespread
shortages
across
venezuela
goicoechea
said
most
latin

also
recognise
guaido
although
italy
so
far
has
not
guaido
has
reached
out
to
italy
s
ruling
coalition
seeking
its
support
maduro
who
retains
control
over
the

denounces
guaido
as
a
puppet
who
is
seeking
to
foment
a
coup
against
him
he
is
supported
by
china
and
russia

on
wednesday
joined
italy
in
defying
the
coordinated
action
of
european
union
nations
and
the
united
states
the
opposition
has
also
sought
to
prevent
the
government
from
selling
gold
believing
that
it
is
using
the
proceeds
to
try
to
stay
solvent
as
the
sanctions
cut
off
other
revenue
streams
but
maduro
s
government
last
year
sold
tonnes
of
gold
to
turkey
and
the
united
arab
emirates
without
the
required
approval
of

bought
the
largest
amount
tonnes
of
gold

a

paparoni
said
we
will
keep
working
so
that
not
one
more
gram
of
gold
can
be
sold

gold
reserves
of

it
does
not
engage
in
any
illegal

prohibited
in
recent
days
at

five
tankers
carrying
gasoline
gasoil

power
generation
and
naphtha
have
been
ordered

guaido
asked
italy
s
ruling
coalition
leaders
in
a
letter
to
meet
with
his
representatives
as
he
seeks
their
explicit
backing
italy
s
league
has
expressed
strong
support
for
guaido
but
coalition
partner
the

though
it
is
