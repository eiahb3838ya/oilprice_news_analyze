the
head
of
a
small
chicago
bank
was
directly
involved
in
approving
million
in
loans
to
former
trump
campaign
chair
paul
manafort
while
seeking
manafort
s
help
securing
a
post
in
the
new
administration
a
witness
testified
on
friday
in
manafort
s
fraud
trial
dennis
raico
a
former
federal
savings
bank
executive
testifying
under
immunity
said
the
bank
s
chief
executive
steve
calk
expressed
interest
in
such
posts
as
treasury
secretary
or
housing
and
urban
development
secretary
calk
took
a
personal
interest
in
manafort
s
loan
applications
and
expedited
them
raico
said
one
loan
was
approved
a
day
after
a
july
call
in
which
calk
let
it
be
known
to
manafort
he
wanted
a
role
in
the
administration
i
knew
steve
was
interested
politics
raico
said
manafort
later
asked
the
incoming
administration
to
consider
tapping
calk
for
secretary
of
the
army
according
to
testimony
earlier
in
the
week
calk
a
retired
army
officer
and
helicopter
pilot
did
not
get
any
post
in
the
administration
although
he
was
named
to
a
trump
campaign
advisory
panel
in
august
a
spokeswoman
for
federal
savings
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
calk
declined
to
comment
raico
was
one
of
just
three
witnesses
called
to
the
stand
on
friday
as
the
trial
resumed
after
an
unexpected
recess
that
lasted
into
the
midafternoon
the
delay
derailed
the
prosecution
s
plans
to
wrap
up
its
case
by
the
end
of
the
week
greg
andres
a
prosecutor
on
special
counsel
robert
mueller
s
team
said
he
would
call
james
brennan
a
vice
president
at
federal
savings
bank
who
was
also
granted
immunity
and
two
other
witnesses
on
monday
before
resting
their
case
it
was
not
clear
if
manafort
who
has
pleaded
not
guilty
to
felony
counts
of
bank
fraud
tax
fraud
and
failing
to
disclose
about
foreign
bank
accounts
will
call
any
witnesses
so
far
manafort
s
lawyers
have
focused
their
defence
on
attacking
rick
gates
manafort
s
former
man
who
cut
a
plea
deal
and
is
cooperating
with
mueller
s
probe
raico
testified
that
gates
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
two
federal
savings
loans
in
question
a
million
mortgage
on
manafort
s
estate
in
the
hamptons
and
a
million
loan
on
a
brownstone
in
brooklyn
prosecutors
say
manafort
lied
about
his
income
and
provided
other
false
information
to
get
the
loans
raico
said
calk
asked
him
to
call
manafort
shortly
after
the
election
to
see
if
he
could
be
a
candidate
for
the
treasury
or
hud
posts
raico
said
the
involvement
of
calk
in
the
manafort
loans
was
unusual
and
made
him
uncomfortable
he
said
had
never
seen
loans
approved
so
quickly
at
the
bank
on
defence
attorney
richard
westling
sought
to
show
that
the
loans
to
manafort
were
justified
westling
pointed
out
that
the
hamptons
property
had
been
appraised
at
million
well
above
the
million
borrowed
and
that
federal
s
credit
committee
had
approved
the
loans
raico
said
that
a
letter
from
gates
indicating
that
he
not
manafort
would
be
paying
for
yankees
season
tickets
in
lowered
his
debts
helping
him
qualify
for
the
federal
loans
in
the
letter
gates
said
he
had
borrowed
manafort
s
american
express
card
to
pay
for
the
tickets
which
cost
more
than
a
year
gates
testified
this
week
the
letter
was
false
and
a
favor
to
manafort
to
help
him
get
the
loans
irfan
kirimca
senior
director
of
ticket
operations
at
the
yankees
testified
on
friday
that
manafort
had
purchased
four
season
tickets
since
at
least
and
that
gates
never
had
an
account
with
the
yankees
kirimca
said
manafort
paid
for
the
legends
suite
package
which
includes
food
service
and
cushioned
seats
kirimca
testified
about
one
email
exchange
in
which
manafort
instructed
a
yankees
employee
to
send
the
tickets
to
his
trump
tower
address
andres
also
on
friday
briefly
questioned
andrew
chojnowski
chief
operating
officer
of
home
lending
at
federal
asking
him
whether
manafort
had
signed
various
documents
warning
that
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
giving
false
information
to
the
bank
chojnowski
read
one
disclaimer
which
noted
that
mortgage
fraud
was
punishable
by
up
to
years
in
prison
andres
said
he
plans
to
call
james
brennan
a
federal
savings
executive
who
like
raico
was
granted
immunity
on
monday
he
then
wants
to
recall
paula
liss
a
special
agent
for
the
treasury
department
s
financial
crimes
enforcement
network
who
testified
earlier
this
week
manafort
s
lawyers
have
opposed
liss
taking
the
stand
again
a
matter
on
which
ellis
the
judge
overseeing
the
case
has
yet
to
rule
ellis
said
the
recess
on
friday
could
not
be
avoided
as
he
had
matters
to
attend
to
without
further
details
courtroom
observers
were
left
to
speculate
about
the
reason
for
the
break
and
a
long
bench
discussion
with
attorneys
from
both
sides
ellis
who
reminded
jurors
in
the
morning
in
unusual
detail
about
the
need
to
keep
an
open
mind
about
the
trial
and
not
to
talk
to
anyone
about
the
case
gave
them
the
same
instructions
before
dismissing
them
for
the
weekend
put
it
completely
out
of
your
mind
until
monday
i
certainly
plan
to
do
that
