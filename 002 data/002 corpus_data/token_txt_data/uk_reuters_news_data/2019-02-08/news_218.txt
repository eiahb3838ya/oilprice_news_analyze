christophe

called
on
authorities
to
take
action
this
is
blackmail
from
people

consider
they
can
beat
up
journalists

disagree
with
the
way
events
are
covered

the
press
is
free

said
france
has
been
rocked
by
yellow
vest
protests
against
macron
s
reforms
since
the
middle
of
november
in
a
movement
that
has
no
designated
leaders
and
is
not
linked
to
political
parties
or
unions
started
as
a
protest
against
high
fuel
prices
the
movement
has
morphed
into
a
fight
for
social
justice
and
more
direct
democracy
several
demonstrations
have
degenerated
into
violent
clashes
with
police
over
the
coming
week
macron
will
launch
three
months
of
national
debate
to
air
grievances
in
the
hope
of
appeasing
the
movement
which
has
undermined
his
authority
and
upended
his
reform
drive
