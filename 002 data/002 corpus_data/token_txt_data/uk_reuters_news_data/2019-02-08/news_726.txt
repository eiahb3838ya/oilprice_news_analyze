pitch
to
freshmen
at

s
tamkang
university
seemed
compelling
join
the
island
s
armed
forces
and
get
a
degree
days
of
leave
each
year
and
annual
savings
of
t
but
many
listening
students
showed
little
interest
arguing
national
service
was
a
waste
of
time
and
prospects
of
the
island
standing
up
economically
or
militarily
to
an
increasingly
aggressive
china
were
slim
china
could
simply
crush
taiwan
with
its
economic
power
there
s
no
need
for
a
war
which
wastes
money

confidence

taiwan
s
military
is
working
hard
to
recruit
soldiers
as
it
moves
to
a
fully
volunteer
force
after
decades
of
conscription
taiwan
vowed
in
to
phase
out
conscription
to
cut
costs
and
boost
the
professionalism
of
its
forces
as
it
tries
to
better
deter
the
chinese
threat
through
enhanced
cyber
warfare
capabilities
and
other
weapons
the
island
s
defence
ministry
said
it
will
be
able
to
reach
a
target
of
enlisting
percent
of
the
estimated
volunteer
troops
needed
to
defend
against
any
attack
by
beijing
by
it
hopes
to
raise
that
to
percent
by
beijing
sees
taiwan
as
a
wayward
province
and
has
never
renounced
the
use
of
force
to
bring
it
to
heel
but
military
experts
and
government
auditors
say
recruitment
is
proving
challenging
and
the
growth
in
voluntary
recruitment
isn
t
fast
enough
to
catch
up
with
a
worsening
military
imbalance
across
the
strait
china
whose
official
defence
budget
grew
to
roughly
times
that
of
taiwan
s
last
year
has
alarmed
taipei
by
flying
bombers
around
the
island
and
luring
away
members
of
its
dwindling
band
of
diplomatic
allies
in
a
report
from
december
three
government
auditors
warned
the
growth
of
voluntary
recruits
had
been
slow
raising
concerns
about
taiwan
s
combat
power
the
government
needs
to
think
whether
it
s
necessary
to
bring
conscription
back
if
they
think
national
security
matters
said
lin
a
convener
for
the
national
policy
foundation
and
former
head
of
taiwan
s
congressional
defence
and
foreign
committee
we
will
pay
a
heavy
price
for
the
move
we
won
t
be
able
to
find
enough
the
island
s
defence
ministry
told
reuters
it
will
continue
to
raise
the
quantity
and
quality
of
its
armed
forces
and
has
made
all
necessary
plans
for
possible
military
actions
from
china
it
also
urged
the
public
to
give
support
and
encouragement
to
the
transition
convincing
more
young
people
to
join
the
armed
forces
is
made
more
difficult
by
taiwan
s
past
as
a
military
dictatorship
the
death
of
a
young
conscript
in
after
being
punished
for
misconduct
which
triggered
large
protests
also
dealt
a
blow
to
the
army
the
service
is
so
unpopular
that
more
than
reservists
were
charged
in
the
last
three
years
for
dodging
mandatory
retraining
it
raises
a
very
difficult
question
about
national
morale
if
there
ever
is
a
conflict
what
are
people
going
to
do
said
william
stanton
professor
at
national
taiwan
university
and
former
head
of
the
de
facto
embassy
in
taipei
taiwan
last
year
spent
nearly
percent
of
its
defence
budget
of
t
billion
on
costs
military
experts
said
that
squeezed
the
budget
for
weapon
acquisitions
the
island
s
goal
to
move
to
an
all
volunteer
force
by
will
be
costlier
than
anticipated
diverting
funds
from
defence
acquisition
and
readiness
the
defense
department
said
in
a
report
to
congress
in
may
taiwan
has
shortened
its
mandatory
service
to
a
training
from
three
years
a
move
analysts
said
was
made
to
placate
young
voters
who
prioritise
personal
liberty
over
civil
obligations
but
for
some
even
the
reduced
training
is
seen
as
an
exercise
in
futility
we
won
t
win
a
war
with
china
anyway
