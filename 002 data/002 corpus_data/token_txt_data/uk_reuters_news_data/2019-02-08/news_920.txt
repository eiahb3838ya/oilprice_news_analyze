pirc advises investors to 'oppose' unilever headquarters move to netherlands
london
reuters
a
leading
proxy
voting
adviser
said
investors
with
shares
of
unilever
should
oppose
the
consumer
goods
company
s
plan
to
create
a
single
holding
company
in
the
netherlands
the
call
by
the
influential
advisory
firm
follows
a
series
of
public
announcements
in
recent
days
from
institutional
investors
concerned
about
the
move
pensions
investment
research
consultants
limited
pirc
which
advises
pension
schemes
and
other
investors
said
it
was
concerned
about
the
impact
on
investors
who
would
be
forced
to
sell
their
shares
the
company
s
exclusion
from
the
ftse
may
compel
some
shareholders
to
sell
their
shares
at
a
price
and
time
that
is
not
of
their
choosing
effectively
resulting
in
a
forced
selling
decision
pirc
said
in
a
report
with
affected
holders
likely
to
be
some
of
unilever
s
investors
the
board
was
being
to
presume
that
they
have
no
voice
pirc
said
ultimately
it
could
be
viewed
that
the
uk
plc
shareholders
are
being
asked
to
consent
to
a
takeover
without
a
premium
being
paid
it
added
pirc
said
it
had
issued
separate
guidance
to
holders
of
the
dutch
shares
backing
the
move
earlier
on
wednesday
royal
london
asset
management
said
it
would
also
vote
against
the
plan
following
similar
statements
from
legal
general
investment
management
schroders
and
others
for
unilever
s
proposal
to
pass
it
needs
approval
from
percent
of
the
uk
plc
s
voted
shares
and
percent
of
the
dutch
nv
s
it
also
needs
to
be
endorsed
by
a
majority
of
shareholders
if
approved
at
votes
scheduled
for
and
the
existing
shares
would
stop
trading
on
with
the
new
shares
beginning
to
trade
