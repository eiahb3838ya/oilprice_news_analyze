australia vows to clean up financial sector after landmark misconduct inquiry
canberra
reuters
a
special
inquiry
excoriated
australia
s
financial
sector
for
misconduct
on
monday
referring
two
dozen
cases
to
regulators
for
possible
legal
action
but
leaving
the
structure
of
the
country
s
powerful
banks
in
place
regulators
will
be
subjected
to
a
new
oversight
body
and
the
financial
industry
s
pay
will
be
overhauled
to
remove
conflicts
of
interest
according
to
the
recommendations
of
the
royal
commission
but
the
recommendations
stopped
short
of
measures
that
would
threaten
the
a
billion
billion
pounds
industry
s
dominant
position
the
recommendations
come
after
the
public
inquiry
heard
months
of
shocking
revelations
of
the
financial
industry
s
wrongdoing
including
that
fees
were
charged
to
the
accounts
of
dead
people
and
that
cash
bribes
were
paid
over
the
counter
to
win
mortgage
business
wiping
a
billion
from
the
country
s
top
finance
stocks
the
conservative
government
which
was
initially
opposed
to
the
setting
up
of
the
inquiry
promised
it
would
act
on
all
the
recommendations
while
the
changes
are
likely
to
make
the
financial
sector
more
liable
to
be
punished
for
violations
banks
in
the
world
s
economy
have
been
spared
any
enforced
breakup
or
interference
in
the
way
they
choose
to
lend
money
the
inquiry
said
it
would
be
costly
and
disruptive
to
separate
banks
providing
products
and
advice
i
don
t
know
that
it
was
a
missed
opportunity
but
a
lot
of
people
were
thinking
that
he
would
force
structural
separation
said
pamela
hanrahan
a
professor
of
commercial
law
at
university
of
new
south
wales
who
advised
the
inquiry
referring
to
its
commissioner
kenneth
hayne
there
are
parts
of
the
community
that
might
have
expected
the
commissioner
to
go
in
a
bit
harder
but
he
has
left
a
very
clear
pathway
for
whomever
is
in
government
and
for
the
industry
to
think
about
what
they
need
to
the
inquiry
recommended
sweeping
changes
to
the
business
and
pay
models
of
mortgage
and
insurance
broking
financial
advice
and
pension
fund
management
authorities
were
urged
to
consider
laying
charges
for
misconduct
like
charging
fees
for
services
not
rendered
including
instances
at
major
lenders
commonwealth
bank
of
australia
national
australia
bank
ltd
and
australia
and
new
zealand
banking
group
misconduct
reached
into
the
sector
s
upper
echelons
with
top
wealth
manager
amp
ltd
engaging
in
deception
of
a
regulator
over
the
deliberate
charging
of
customers
for
financial
advice
it
never
gave
firms
were
found
to
prey
on
some
of
society
s
most
vulnerable
customers
highlighted
by
the
case
of
an
insurer
who
used
aggressive
sales
techniques
to
sell
an
opaque
product
to
a
young
man
with
down
syndrome
the
price
paid
by
our
community
has
been
immense
and
goes
beyond
just
the
financial
businesses
have
been
broken
and
the
emotional
stress
and
personal
pain
have
broken
lives
australian
treasurer
josh
frydenberg
said
the
recommendations
included
banning
trailing
commissions
for
mortgage
brokers
forcing
financial
planners
to
disclose
any
fees
they
receive
for
selling
products
and
banning
banks
from
charging
default
interest
for
farm
businesses
affected
by
drought
regulators
also
needed
greater
oversight
after
they
were
accused
of
working
too
closely
with
the
banks
when
misconduct
was
revealed
it
either
went
unpunished
or
the
consequences
did
not
reflect
the
seriousness
of
what
had
been
done
the
inquiry
found
australia
s
corporate
regulator
said
in
response
to
the
report
that
it
would
prioritise
serious
matters
referred
to
it
by
the
royal
commission
for
possible
prosecutions
ahead
of
the
report
s
release
which
came
after
the
close
of
market
trading
in
sydney
shares
in
the
big
four
banks
closed
up
about
percent
as
investors
looked
forward
to
some
certainty
around
the
new
regulatory
framework
however
wealth
managers
whose
reputations
were
shredded
in
the
inquiry
were
punished
with
ioof
holdings
ltd
stock
closing
down
percent
and
amp
sliding
to
a
record
low
the
broader
market
closed
percent
higher
the
key
macro
issue
we
have
been
interested
in
is
if
this
was
going
to
further
reduce
the
banks
willingness
to
lend
which
would
be
a
further
headwind
to
the
economy
which
is
already
under
some
pressure
said
andrew
ticehurst
a
strategist
at
nomura
at
this
stage
it
does
not
appear
to
be
the
case
it
would
be
a
bit
milder
than
fallout
from
the
royal
commission
has
already
prompted
banks
to
tighten
lending
practices
in
their
core
mortgage
businesses
contributing
to
some
of
the
biggest
housing
price
falls
in
a
generation
the
report
comes
ahead
of
an
election
expected
in
may
in
which
falling
house
prices
could
be
a
issue
the
government
is
fighting
for
its
survival
with
opinion
polls
suggesting
an
election
victory
for
the
labour
party
labour
says
it
expects
to
adopt
all
the
commission
s
recommendations
while
prime
minister
scott
morrison
has
also
said
he
will
take
up
the
recommendations
he
has
warned
against
overreaching
and
cutting
off
credit
flows
the
report
from
hayne
a
former
high
court
justice
found
that
the
industry
s
problems
were
exacerbated
by
an
unwillingness
to
accept
responsibility
that
is
there
remains
a
reluctance
in
some
entities
to
form
and
then
to
give
practical
effect
to
their
understanding
of
what
is
ethical
of
what
is
efficient
honest
and
fair
of
what
is
the
right
thing
to
do
the
report
said
national
australia
bank
chairman
ken
henry
came
in
for
particular
criticism
after
appearing
dismissive
during
his
public
interrogation
by
the
commission
s
barristers
i
thought
it
telling
that
dr
henry
seemed
unwilling
to
accept
any
criticism
of
how
the
board
had
dealt
with
some
issues
commissioner
hayne
wrote
adding
he
was
not
as
confident
as
i
would
wish
to
be
that
the
lessons
of
the
past
have
been
learned
australian
banking
association
chief
anna
bligh
said
banks
accept
full
responsibility
for
these
failings
and
they
know
that
they
must
now
change
to
ensure
that
this
never
happens
again
banks
are
determined
to
learn
the
lessons
to
fix
the
problems
and
to
make
it
right
