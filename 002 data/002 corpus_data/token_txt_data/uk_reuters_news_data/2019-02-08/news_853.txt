reuters
three
days
before
president
donald
trump
took
office
in
january
chinese
president
xi
jinping
portrayed
beijing
as
the
champion
and
defender
of
globalisation
at
the
davos
world
economic
forum
amid
rising
fears
of
trade
protectionism
a
few
months
later
as
xi
launched
a
forum
on
china
s
vast
belt
and
road
effort
promising
to
spread
chinese
investment
and
soft
power
through
the
world
it
appeared
his
country
s
global
stature
was
rising
but
now
the
lustre
on
beijing
s
trade
and
investment
story
has
dulled
amid
rising
tariffs
higher
interest
rates
and
capital
flight
from
emerging
markets
all
of
which
threaten
to
erode
global
growth
at
the
international
monetary
fund
and
world
bank
annual
meetings
on
the
indonesian
resort
island
of
bali
some
of
that
sentiment
spilled
into
the
open
i
think
there
is
a
broad
view
growing
in
the
west
that
china
has
in
some
ways
taken
advantage
of
the
system
said
charles
dallara
former
head
of
the
institute
of
international
finance
who
attended
the
meetings
it
reminds
me
of
the
view
in
the
west
of
japan
in
the
very
much
calls
to
fix
global
trading
rules
are
tellingly
coming
not
just
from
the
trump
administration
imf
managing
director
christine
lagarde
this
week
laid
out
what
needed
to
be
done
this
means
looking
at
the
distortionary
effects
of
state
subsidies
improving
the
enforcement
of
intellectual
property
rights
and
taking
steps
to
ensure
effective
competition
to
avoid
the
excesses
of
positions
she
said
at
a
trade
conference
during
the
bali
meetings
lagarde
did
not
mention
china
but
all
those
issues
are
charges
frequently
levelled
by
the
trump
administration
others
were
less
restrained
we
absolutely
need
to
address
the
issue
of
overcapacities
in
china
nobody
can
say
that
this
is
not
a
problem
this
has
to
be
dealt
with
european
commissioner
for
economic
and
financial
affairs
pierre
moscovici
said
at
the
same
event
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
struck
a
more
confident
tone
at
the
bali
meetings
compared
with
similar
gatherings
over
the
last
year
when
he
was
the
target
of
criticism
over
trump
s
tariff
plans
fresh
off
a
deal
to
revamp
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
with
mexico
and
canada
and
with
trade
talks
coming
soon
with
the
european
union
and
japan
the
administration
is
trying
to
build
a
coalition
of
allies
to
revamp
global
trade
rules
to
combat
technology
transfer
and
other
trade
policies
it
associates
with
china
mnuchin
said
allies
first
viewed
trump
s
trade
views
as
simply
protectionist
but
now
have
a
better
understanding
of
his
desire
for
free
fair
and
reciprocal
this
is
not
a
coalition
to
pressure
china
this
is
a
coalition
of
people
who
have
very
similar
issues
as
it
relates
to
china
mnuchin
said
china
is
still
a
major
political
and
economic
power
but
chinese
officials
appeared
more
on
the
defensive
this
week
with
the
tone
of
debate
at
some
imf
forums
shifting
more
quickly
than
beijing
may
have
expected
vice
finance
minister
zou
jiayi
on
a
world
bank
panel
on
xi
s
signature
belt
and
road
initiative
found
herself
fielding
questions
from
other
panelists
and
the
audience
over
debt
sustainability
how
effectively
small
countries
could
negotiate
with
beijing
and
whether
the
effort
was
viable
in
the
midst
of
a
protracted
trade
war
the
debt
burdens
from
the
belt
and
road
initiative
came
into
sharper
focus
as
pakistan
a
major
recipient
of
port
rail
and
road
projects
formally
sought
an
imf
bailout
programme
during
the
bali
meetings
zou
said
china
was
using
risk
analysis
methods
from
bodies
such
as
the
imf
and
world
bank
and
would
supervise
the
projects
debt
more
vigorously
but
she
also
said
that
they
are
essentially
commercial
projects
and
that
countries
should
exercise
caution
and
make
their
own
evaluations
of
their
commercial
viability
and
she
said
some
of
the
risks
came
from
a
drastic
change
in
external
environment
giving
an
example
of
an
unnamed
african
country
with
sound
debt
levels
that
sank
into
crisis
after
oil
prices
tanked
and
its
currency
fell
david
dollar
a
former
treasury
official
and
a
senior
fellow
at
the
brookings
institution
who
spoke
on
the
panel
said
that
belt
and
road
could
reduce
trade
costs
but
that
more
work
needed
to
be
done
for
countries
there
is
really
this
risk
of
taking
on
too
much
debt
even
if
the
projects
are
very
very
good
dollar
said
some
delegates
from
china
at
the
bali
imf
and
world
bank
meetings
expressed
frustration
that
beijing
s
agenda
was
being
bypassed
while
international
institutions
had
largely
been
ineffective
in
deterring
trump
s
tariff
actions
personally
i
think
unfortunately
the
hasn
t
contributed
much
to
reconciliation
and
coordination
of
macroeconomic
policies
across
the
world
said
xiang
songzuo
deputy
director
of
international
monetary
institute
at
renmin
university
of
china
who
was
a
speaker
at
a
sideline
event
during
the
meetings
in
bali
we
wish
all
these
forums
including
un
world
bank
imf
wto
would
become
stronger
stronger
and
more
productive
in
containing
all
these
wrong
things
protectionism
unilateralism
xiang
added
the
current
leaders
of
the
which
bills
itself
as
a
leading
forum
that
seeks
to
develop
global
policies
and
address
the
most
pressing
challenges
conceded
that
it
is
effectively
sidelined
on
trade
the
can
play
a
role
in
providing
the
platform
for
discussions
said
argentine
treasury
minister
nicolas
dujovne
chairman
of
this
year
s
finance
leaders
meeting
but
the
differences
that
still
persist
should
be
resolved
by
the
members
that
are
directly
involved
in
the
although
there
are
reports
that
xi
and
trump
will
meet
at
the
leaders
summit
on
november
mnuchin
told
reuters
that
currency
issues
would
be
part
of
trade
talks
and
that
the
onus
was
squarely
on
china
to
take
concrete
steps
before
trade
talks
could
resume
this
can
t
just
be
talk
there
have
to
be
meaningful
commitments
to
create
a
rebalanced
trading
relationship
mnuchin
told
reporters
on
saturday
adding
that
structural
changes
were
needed
to
balance
the
relationship
this
is
not
about
buying
more
soybeans
and
buying
more
lng
