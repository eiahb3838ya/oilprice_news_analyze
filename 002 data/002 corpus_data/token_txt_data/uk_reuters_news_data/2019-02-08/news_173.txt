for

on
thursday
what
i
did
was
at
the
direction
of
and
for
the
sole
benefit
of
realdonaldtrump
potus
i
truly
regret
my
blind
loyalty
to
a
man
who
doesn
t
deserve
the
attempts
to
influence
the
polls
ultimately
proved
largely
unsuccessful
but
shed
a
light
on
the
tactics
of
the
trump
campaign
and
cohen
s
role
within
it
on
the
campaign
trail
trump
frequently
referred
to
his
polling
numbers
to
help
fuel
his
candidacy
cohen
was
sentenced
last
month
to
three
years
in
prison
for
his
role
in
making
illegal
payments
to
women
to
help
trump
s
campaign
and
for
lying
to
congress
about
a
proposed
trump
tower
project
in
russia
cohen
has
said
trump
had
directed
him
to
commit
the
violations
which
trump
has
denied
the
journal
said
cohen
commissioned
john
gauger
who
runs
redfinch
solutions
to
write
a
computer
script
to
repeatedly
vote
for
trump
in
a
february
drudge
report
poll
on
potential
republican
candidates
the
move
came
as
trump
was
preparing
to
enter
the
presidential
election
race
the
newspaper
reported
trump
ranked
fifth
in
the
drudge
report
poll
with
about
votes
or
percent
of
the
total
according
to
the
journal
cohen
also
commissioned
gauger
to
do
the
same
for
a
cnbc
online
poll
identifying
the
country
s
top
business
leaders
although
trump
was
unable
to
break
into
the
top
candidates
the
journal
reported
the
president
has
no
knowledge
of
the
polls
being
rigged
trump
lawyer
rudy
giuliani
said
in
an
interview
with
reuters
trump
tweeted
about
a
cnbc
poll
on
business
leaders
in
calling
it
a
joke
and
suggested
he
was
removed
from
the
list
because
of
reuters
was
not
immediately
able
to
confirm
the
details
of
the
newspaper
report
cohen
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
and
neither
did
representatives
for
redfinch
solutions
and
the
trump
organization
charles
james
a
lawyer
for
gauger
declined
to
comment
gauger
said
cohen
paid
him
in
cash
out
of
a
blue
walmart
bag
although
not
for
the
total
amount
he
was
owed
cohen
also
promised
gauger
work
on
the
trump
campaign
that
never
materialized
according
to
the
journal
cohen
worked
for
trump
for
many
years
as
his
fixer
and
once
said
he
would
take
a
bullet
for
trump
but
the
relationship
has
since
publicly
soured
trump
has
called
cohen
a
rat
while
cohen
has
cooperated
with
special
counsel
robert
mueller
s
investigation
of
links
between
the
trump
campaign
and
russia
during
the
campaign
both
trump
and
moscow
have
denied
any
wrongdoing
cohen
has
also
agreed
to
testify
publicly
in
front
of
the
house
of
representatives
oversight
committee
in
a
hearing
scheduled
to
take
place
next
month
