environmental
campaigners
launched
a
boat
on
the
river
thames
on
thursday
made
almost
entirely
of
recycled
plastic
waste
in
an
effort
to
raise
awareness
of
growing
levels
of
rubbish
in
britain
s
waterways
the
punt
was
built
by
mark
edwards
who
also
made
the
gloriana
barge
for
queen
elizabeth
s
diamond
jubilee
named
the
pet
project
the
boat
will
run
regular
trips
along
the
river
to
fish
out
plastic
rubbish
which
in
turn
will
be
used
to
build
more
such
vessels
edwards
used
traditional
techniques
to
make
the
boat
we
went
back
to
the
technology
inherited
from
the
vikings
he
told
reporters
at
the
launch
in
richmond
southwest
london
it
took
us
two
men
about
six
weeks
flat
out
so
it
s
quite
a
lot
of
work
but
for
a
craft
that
s
going
to
last
years
it
s
each
year
tonnes
of
rubbish
is
cleared
from
the
thames
and
a
large
proportion
of
it
is
food
and
drink
packaging
that
comes
from
dry
land
says
the
environmental
charity
hubbub
which
is
behind
the
project
it
adds
on
its
website
much
of
the
litter
is
being
eaten
by
birds
fish
and
other
species
which
is
leading
to
percent
of
thames
fish
found
to
have
plastic
in
their
pet
project
is
hubbub
s
second
boat
made
of
recycled
plastic
waste
i
think
this
shows
that
plastic
is
not
just
an
issue
that
s
in
far
away
oceans
it
s
present
here
in
london
and
actually
there
s
lots
we
can
all
do
about
it
said
its
director
gavin
ellis
it
s
about
making
sure
you
don
t
put
litter
in
an
overflowing
bin
where
it
can
blow
out
into
the
river
and
it
s
obviously
about
not
dropping
litter
directly
into
the
