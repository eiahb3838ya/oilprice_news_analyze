london

delays
to
the
planned
sale
of
toshiba
s
nugen
nuclear
project
in
britain
have
prompted
a
review
of
the
roles
of
direct
employees
who
are
mainly
based
in
manchester
raising
further
doubts
over
its
future
the
plant
in
moorside
england
was
expected
to
provide
around
percent
of
britain
s
electricity
when
built
but
has
faced
several
setbacks
after
toshiba
s
nuclear
arm
westinghouse
went
bankrupt
last
year
following
the
westinghouse
bankruptcy
nugen
joint
venture
partner
engie
pulled
out
of
the
project
leaving
the
japanese
firm
searching
for
new
investors
toshiba
put
nugen
up
for
sale
and
south
korea
s
korea
electric
power
corp
kepco
was
chosen
as
preferred
bidder
last
year
but
the
process
has
stalled
britain
needs
to
invest
in
new
capacity
to
replace
aging
coal
and
nuclear
reactors
that
are
due
to
close
in
the
but
large
new
plants
have
struggled
to
get
off
the
ground
due
to
high
costs
and
weak
electricity
prices
toshiba
has
pursued
a
sale
of
nugen
to
kepco
and
the
prolonged
time
it
has
taken
reach
a
conclusion
has
required
nugen
to
undertake
a
review
a
spokesman
for
nugen
said
as
such
additional
options
are
being
pursued
for
nugen
s
future
direction
to
deliver
the
next
generation
of
nuclear
new
build
in
the
uk
he
said
nugen
has
around
direct
employees
mostly
based
in
manchester
while
the
roles
of
around
contractors
would
also
be
placed
under
a
day
consultation
period
later
this
week
the
spokesman
added
britain
s
government
has
yet
to
announce
any
kind
of
deal
for
the
nugen
project
we
continue
to
engage
with
new
build
developers
though
the
detail
of
these
discussions
is
commercially
confidential
a
spokeswoman
for
the
business
energy
and
industrial
strategy
department
said
another
plant
to
be
built
by
a
unit
of
japan
s
hitachi
ltd
has
also
struggled
to
find
funding
leading
the
british
government
to
consider
direct
investment
however
edf
s
hinkley
point
c
will
be
the
first
new
nuclear
plant
built
in
the
country
in
more
than
twenty
years
after
securing
additional
backing
from
the
french
government
investment
from
china
general
nuclear
power
corp
and
a
power
price
guarantee
from
britain
the
government
has
been
criticised
for
being
too
generous
in
the
terms
it
has
set
for
this
deal
