a
bigger
than
expected
loss
in
the
fourth
quarter
and
weakness
at
its
investment
bank
overshadowed
the
first
annual
profit
in
four
years
for
deutsche
bank
germany
s
largest
lender
has
been
trying
to
turn
itself
around
under
a
new
leadership
but
has
faced
a
series
of
hurdles
including
allegations
of
money
laundering
ratings
downgrades
and
failed
stress
tests
deutsche
has
also
become
the
subject
of
rampant
merger
speculation
and
friday
s
earnings
figures
underscore
that
the
company
still
has
a
long
way
ahead
to
post
a
sustainable
profit
time
is
running
out
for
the
bank
to
turn
around
on
its
own
making
a
merger
with
rival
commerzbank
more
likely
two
people
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
on
thursday
results
were
a
mixed
bag
with
deutsche
posting
a
profit
of
million
euros
million
compared
with
a
net
loss
of
million
euros
in
our
return
to
profitability
shows
that
deutsche
bank
is
on
the
right
track
said
chief
executive
christian
sewing
who
took
over
last
april
and
has
embarked
on
plans
to
cut
more
than
jobs
in
an
overhaul
of
the
bank
in
we
aim
not
only
to
save
costs
but
also
to
make
focused
investments
in
growth
he
said
sewing
in
an
interview
with
reuters
tv
said
he
was
optimistic
that
profit
would
grow
in
but
it
was
not
all
good
news
on
the
downside
the
net
loss
of
million
euros
was
greater
than
the
million
euros
expected
on
average
by
analysts
according
to
a
consensus
report
on
the
bank
s
website
the
quarter
was
marked
by
continued
weakness
in
its
key
trading
business
revenue
at
its
division
plunged
percent
for
the
investment
bank
as
a
whole
revenue
dropped
percent
in
the
fourth
quarter
executives
said
that
negative
headlines
about
police
raids
on
the
bank
in
november
dented
business
the
weakness
in
investment
banking
is
striking
said
alexandra
annecke
fund
manager
with
union
investment
which
holds
the
bank
s
stock
it
needs
to
finally
be
possible
to
stop
the
loss
of
market
share
she
said
analysts
at
citigroup
said
they
feared
that
deutsche
s
investment
bank
would
continue
to
lose
ground
to
competitors
a
downgrade
in
market
expectations
for
future
earnings
is
possible
they
added
the
bank
s
shares
lost
more
than
half
their
value
in
though
they
have
recovered
slightly
over
the
past
month
they
opened
slightly
higher
early
in
frankfurt
but
were
down
percent
by
gmt
sewing
in
a
call
with
analysts
when
asked
about
merger
speculation
said
that
the
bank
was
focused
on
executing
its
plan
and
that
he
had
a
lot
of
confidence
he
later
told
journalists
the
bank
was
fully
focused
on
its
homework
of
turning
around
the
bank
sewing
also
denied
there
was
any
pressure
from
the
german
government
to
merge
i
do
not
feel
that
and
there
is
no
intervention
either
he
was
quoted
as
saying
by
german
broadcaster
speculation
of
a
merger
between
the
two
has
heightened
under
the
tenure
of
finance
minister
olaf
scholz
who
has
spoken
in
favor
of
strong
banks
his
team
has
met
frequently
with
executives
of
deutsche
commerzbank
and
major
shareholders
deutsche
is
considered
one
of
the
most
important
banks
for
the
global
financial
system
along
with
jpmorgan
chase
bank
of
america
and
citigroup
but
the
german
lender
has
been
plagued
by
losses
and
a
scandal
a
billion
fine
in
for
its
role
in
the
mortgage
market
crisis
was
a
major
blow
that
spooked
clients
and
concerned
regulators
the
european
central
bank
has
set
conditions
for
a
possible
merger
between
deutsche
and
commerzbank
