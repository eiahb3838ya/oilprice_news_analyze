prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
faces
an
uphill
battle
to
be
in
a
national
poll
due
by
may
we
will
look
very
seriously
and
thoughtfully
and
humbly
at
the
way
in
which
the
voters
have
responded
turnbull
told
reporters
in
sydney
on
sunday
in
what
was
coined
super
saturday
voters
in
five
seats
went
to
the
polls
after
a
handful
of
mainly
labor
opposition
lawmakers
were
forced
from
office
after
falling
foul
of
the
country
s
constitution
that
bans
politicians
from
elected
office
if
they
are
dual
citizens
the
australian
electoral
commission
aec
on
sunday
said
four
seats
were
retained
by
labor
and
a
fifth
by
the
small

say
turnbull
must
win
marginal
seats
in
the
state
of
queensland
traditionally
a
conservative
heartland
if

his
government
failed

labor
retained
the

with
a

ratings
said
the
results
reflected
the
party
s
focus
on
core
issues
such
as
health
and
education
it
renews
my
conviction
to
double
down
in
fighting
for
fairness
and
challenging
growing
inequality
