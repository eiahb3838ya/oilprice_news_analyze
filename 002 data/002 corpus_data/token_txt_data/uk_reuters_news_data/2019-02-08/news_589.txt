there
have
been
extensive
doubts
about
the
plan
it
has
been
opposed
by
rohingya
at
camps
in
bangladesh
and
the
refugee
agency
and
aid
groups
who
fear
for
the
safety
of
the
rohingya
in
myanmar
hundreds

had
returned

bangladesh
for
failing
to
bring
any
returnees
but
said
it
remained
ready
to
accept

weak
in
following
the
physical
arrangement

affairs
ministry
at

media
briefing
we
will
accept
them
according

return
what
can
we
do
we
will
not

pressure
on
myanmar
to
accept

demand
that
myanmar
recognises
their
ethnic
identity

their
original
homes
and
lands
