london
reuters
brexit
will
cost
britain
up
to
financial
services
jobs
in
the
the
city
of
london
financial
district
s
leader
said
on
tuesday
and
many
more
jobs
might
disappear
in
the
longer
term
at
the
lower
end
of
the
scale
jobs
could
be
lost
to
eu
states
catherine
mcguinness
told
parliament
s
exiting
the
european
union
committee
more
than
million
people
work
in
financial
services
across
britain
with
in
london
we
are
not
expecting
a
big
brexodus
in
the
first
instance
but
depending
on
how
things
pan
out
in
the
longer
term
we
may
see
many
more
go
mcguinness
told
lawmakers
banks
insurers
and
asset
managers
in
britain
are
opening
hubs
in
the
eu
before
britain
s
departure
from
the
eu
in
march
to
ensure
continuity
in
services
to
customers
there
so
far
there
have
been
confirmed
job
moves
a
city
of
london
spokeswoman
said
separately
the
city
was
disappointed
that
britain
s
government
ditched
its
preferred
option
of
future
eu
trade
based
on
mutual
recognition
whereby
britain
and
the
eu
accept
each
other
s
rules
under
regulatory
cooperation
we
had
expected
continued
support
for
mutual
recognition
mcguinness
said
instead
britain
has
asked
for
access
based
on
a
more
accommodative
version
of
the
eu
s
equivalence
system
used
by
japan
and
the
united
states
whereby
brussels
alone
decides
who
gets
access
the
eu
had
already
dismissed
mutual
recognition
and
has
said
it
won
t
adapt
its
equivalence
system
in
the
way
britain
wants
we
can
all
see
it
s
going
to
be
an
uphill
task
to
persuade
the
mcguinness
said
huw
evans
director
general
of
the
association
of
british
insurers
said
that
opting
for
some
form
of
equivalence
posed
a
risk
that
britain
would
end
up
becoming
a
rule
taker
having
to
continue
copying
eu
rules
in
return
for
access
after
brexit
you
are
asking
the
eu
to
partner
with
you
in
a
way
to
make
equivalence
work
in
future
equivalence
is
something
the
eu
considers
proprietary
evans
said
it
s
quite
a
big
psychological
there
was
plenty
of
opportunity
for
mischief
making
by
eu
states
topping
up
equivalence
with
national
rules
evans
said
the
lawmakers
also
quizzed
the
broadcasting
and
tech
sectors
about
britain
s
white
paper
proposals
for
future
eu
trade
which
calls
for
full
access
for
goods
but
less
access
for
services
in
return
for
flexibility
to
diverge
from
eu
rules
sammy
wilson
a
committee
member
accused
the
industry
officials
of
giving
alarmist
evidence
adding
that
foreign
direct
investment
in
financial
services
was
around
a
high
you
are
now
trying
to
do
an
airbus
on
us
with
the
kind
of
evidence
you
have
been
giving
wilson
said
referring
to
brexit
warnings
from
the
european
aircraft
manufacturer
that
angered
some
government
ministers
there
is
no
getting
away
that
brexit
is
deeply
suboptimal
evans
replied
this
isn
t
a
scare
story
added
mcguinness
the
government
also
ditched
mutual
recognition
for
broadcasters
from
its
white
paper
but
unlike
with
banks
proposed
no
alternative
adam
minns
executive
director
of
commercial
broadcasters
association
told
lawmakers
the
white
paper
for
us
was
a
backward
step
we
are
not
certain
if
we
are
being
thrown
under
a
bus
or
just
hitting
a
temporary
roadblock
this
could
not
have
come
at
a
worst
time
minns
said
britain
is
home
to
international
tv
channels
that
beam
programmes
to
viewers
in
the
european
union
but
without
an
eu
licence
they
would
have
to
relocate
minns
said
giles
derrington
head
of
brexit
policy
at
techuk
said
the
sector
wanted
the
same
as
proposed
for
goods
meaning
eu
rules
in
return
for
eu
access
but
without
flexibility
to
diverge
the
tech
sector
struggles
to
see
where
the
benefits
of
diverging
from
eu
rules
would
come
from
derrington
said
lawmakers
asked
whether
the
industry
officials
if
they
would
like
britain
to
join
norway
in
the
european
economic
area
whose
members
must
follow
eu
rules
but
without
any
say
over
them
i
look
at
the
eea
longingly
we
don
t
desire
more
flexibility
at
the
moment
