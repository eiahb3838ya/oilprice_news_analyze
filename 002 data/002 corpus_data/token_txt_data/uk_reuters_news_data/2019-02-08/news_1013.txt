kim
jong
un
wants
a
second
summit
with
president
donald
trump
soon
to
hasten
denuclearisation
but
a
key
goal
is
declaring
an
end
this
year
to
the
korean
war
the
south
s
president
moon
said
on
thursday
moon
said
he
and
kim
spent
most
of
a
summit
discussing
how
to
break
an
impasse
and
restart
nuclear
talks
between
pyongyang
and
washington
which
are
at
odds
over
which
should
come
first
denuclearisation
or
ending
the
war
kim
who
recently
proposed
another
summit
with
trump
after
their
unprecedented
june
talks
in
singapore
said
the
north
was
willing
to
permanently
dismantle
key
missile
facilities
in
the
presence
of
outside
experts
and
the
yongbyon
main
nuclear
complex
if
the
united
states
took
corresponding
action
the
joint
statement
from
the
summit
stipulates
his
commitment
to
a
verifiable
irreversible
dismantlement
of
the
nuclear
programmes
and
ending
the
war
would
be
a
first
reciprocal
step
moon
said
chairman
kim
expressed
his
wish
that
he
wanted
to
complete
denuclearisation
quickly
and
focus
on
economic
development
moon
told
a
news
conference
in
seoul
shortly
after
returning
from
the
summit
with
kim
in
pyongyang
he
hoped
a
second
summit
with
trump
would
take
place
in
the
near
future
in
order
to
move
the
denuclearisation
process
along
moon
said
kim
was
also
open
to
inspection
of
a
nuclear
test
site
in
the
northwest
town
of
which
he
called
the
north
s
sole
existing
facility
for
underground
detonations
while
pyongyang
has
stopped
nuclear
and
missile
tests
this
year
it
failed
to
keep
its
pledge
to
allow
international
inspections
of
its
dismantling
of
the
site
in
may
stirring
criticism
that
the
move
could
be
reversed
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
on
wednesday
he
had
invited
north
korea
s
foreign
minister
to
meet
in
new
york
next
week
and
other
pyongyang
officials
to
vienna
for
talks
with
nuclear
envoy
stephen
biegun
asked
on
thursday
if
those
meetings
would
take
place
state

said
invitations
had
been
sent
and
added
we
certainly
stand
ready
to
meet
if
they
are
able
nauert
said
washington
looked
forward
to
a
formal
readout
of
the
talks
in
meetings
with
the
south
koreans
next
week
which
will
include
one
between
trump
and

of
the

asked
about
pompeo
s
statement
on
wednesday
welcoming
plans
for
the
dismantlement
of
all
facilities
at
yongbyon
in
the
presence
of
and
iaea
inspectors
nauert
said
moon
and
kim
had
talked
about
inspectors
having
iaea
inspectors
and
united
states
inspectors
be
a
part
of
anything
is
really
just
a
shared
understanding
she
said
any
time
you
have
a
nuclear
situation
like
this
where
there
is
a
dismantlement
the
expectation
is
that
the
iaea
would
be
part
of
that
so
that
would
be
just
the
normal
course
of
doing
business
we
have
that
shared
understanding
with
the
asked
why
this
detail
was
not
in
the
document
signed
by
moon
and
kim
nauert
replied
we
have
had
conversations
with
the
government
of
north
korea
and
that
is
our
mutual
understanding
that
is
also
the
understanding
between
south
korea
and
north
korea
that
was
one
of
the
things
discussed
according
to
my
understanding
of
it
over
the
past
few
nauert
did
not
respond
when
asked
if
the
united
states
was
willing
to
take
corresponding
measures
except
to
say
nothing
can
happen
in
the
absence
of
denuclearisation
denuclearisation
has
to
come
the
north
korean
ambassador
to
the
united
nations
kim
song
did
not
reply
when
asked
by
reporters
on
thursday
if
his
foreign
minister
would
meet
pompeo
on
the
sidelines
of
the
general
assembly
next
week
kim
pledged
to
work
towards
the
complete
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
during
two
meetings
with
moon
and
his
encounter
with
trump
but
negotiations
on
how
to
implement
the
vague
commitments
have
since
faltered
washington
calls
for
concrete
action
such
as
a
full
disclosure
of
north
korea
s
nuclear
and
missile
facilities
before
satisfying
pyongyang
s
key
demands
including
an
official
end
to
the
war
and
the
easing
of
international
sanctions
the
war
ended
in
an
armistice
rather
than
a
peace
treaty
meaning
united
nations
forces
including
south
korea
are
technically
still
at
war
with
the
north
but
there
have
been
concerns
in
south
korea
and
the
united
states
that
ending
the
war
would
ultimately
prompt
china
and
russia
if
not
north
korea
to
demand
that
the
united
nations
command
unc
which
overlaps
with
forces
in
south
korea
be
disbanded
and
leave
seoul
aims
to
jointly
announce
with
the
united
states
an
end
to
the
war
within
this
year
a
measure
moon
said
he
would
discuss
with
trump
when
they
meet
next
week
at
the
united
nations
general
assembly
in
new
york
an
declaration
would
not
affect
the
presence
of
troops
and
the
unc
in
the
south
moon
said
adding
that
kim
shared
his
view
it
would
be
a
political
declaration
that
would
mark
a
starting
point
for
peace
negotiations
moon
said
a
peace
treaty
would
be
sealed
as
well
as
normalisation
of
north
relations
after
the
north
