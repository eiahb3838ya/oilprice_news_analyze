of
the
largest
independent
news
outlet
in
hungary
say
they
will
not
meddle
in
its
editorial
policies
reporters
at
are
far
from
sure
and
recent
history
shows
why
dozens
of
newspapers
radio
and
television
stations
critical
of
prime
minister
viktor
orban
have
changed
hands
in
the
past
four
years
some
subsequently
closed
down
while
others
quickly
and
dramatically
changed
their
tune
on
the
day
news
channel
hir
tv
was
taken
over
last
month
one
of
its
new
owners
zsolt

the
newsroom
he
would
not
interfere
with
its
work
that
evening
s
programmes
including
a
political
talk
show
were
cancelled
in
its
place
a
recent
orban
speech
played
on
a
loop
last
week
the
european
union
s
parliament
voted
to
punish
hungary
for
flouting
eu
rules
on
democracy
corruption
and
civil
rights
including
media
freedom
although
the
actual
punishment
suspending
its
voting
rights
is
unlikely
an
eu
parliamentary
report
said
media
had
been
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
oligarchs
advertising
went
largely
to
outlets
loyal
to
the
government
and
other
journalists
were
often
banned
from
parliament
hungary
s
government
has
denied
undermining
press
freedom
and
says
it
has
no
desire
to
control
the
media
it
is
taking
the
eu
parliament
to
court
accusing
it
of
breaching
voting
rules
asked
about
index
s
independence
one
of
its
new
ultimate
owners
gabor
ziegler
said
on
wednesday
it
was
guaranteed
we
have
no
right
to
interfere
with
daily
editing
or
the
paper
s
contents
he
said
in
an
interview
with
one
of
a
number
of
smaller
sites
clustered
around
index
that
ziegler
and
his
partner
also
acquired
we
need
an
independent
widely
read
and
decidedly
to
achieve
our
business
s
editorial
line
has
not
changed
since
the
takeover
on
monday
but
staff
are
on
the
alert
a
new
dial
on
its
home
page
has
a
needle
pointing
towards
independent
next
to
it
is
in
danger
and
further
along
not
independent
when
it
changes
we
ll
talk
as
loudly
as
possible
the
strapline
says
a
statement
signed
by
dozens
of
staff
likened
the
situation
to
a
war
chief
editor
attila
told
reuters
his
fellow
journalists
were
tense
we
would
like
to
work
peacefully
he
said
it
is
not
good
for
anyone
for
us
to
be
the
ziegler
and
media
investor
jozsef
oltyan
gained
ultimate
control
over
index
by
buying
media
group
online
zrt
which
sells
its
advertising
space
as
well
as
the
company
owning
the
foundation
set
up
to
guarantee
index
s
editorial
freedom
oltyan
is
a
member
of
a
party
in
coalition
with
orban
s
ruling
fidesz
while
ziegler
has
been
a
staff
member
on
index
s
business
side
for
nearly
two
decades
editor
said
he
was
concerned
that
the
ownership
change
could
bring
under
the
influence
of
fidesz
and
its
ideological
agenda
called
the
national
system
of
cooperation
ner
ner
was
launched
in
to
counter
liberal
values
and
champion
nationalist
policies
and
under
its
auspices
some
of
orban
s
friends
and
family
have
won
an
increasing
share
of
publicly
funded
business
what
seems
to
be
the
doomsday
scenario
may
be
reality
said
it
may
in
fact
be
the
ner
approaching
index
right
ziegler
denied
that
i
would
like
to
reject
that
in
the
strongest
possible
terms
he
wrote
in
an
emailed
response
to
reuters
we
decided
freely
to
buy
the
companies
that
own
index
and
sister
publications
there
is
nobody
behind
he
added
that
nobody
had
the
option
to
buy
the
companies
in
the
future
and
they
wanted
to
hold
on
to
them
for
the
long
term
oltyan
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
since
orban
was
reelected
for
a
third
straight
term
in
a
landslide
election
in
april
the
pace
of
news
outlets
changing
hands
has
accelerated
political
loyalty
has
paid
off
for
dozens
of
titles
that
have
toed
the
government
line
those
that
back
orban
get
more
state
advertising
spending
media
researchers
say
about
percent
of
state
online
ad
spending
goes
to
index
for
example
while
its
closest
rival
origo
gets
about
percent
a
proportion
that
shot
up
after
its
takeover
by
a
group
in
media
analysis
group
mertek
said
asked
about
state
ad
revenue
ziegler
told
if
the
change
of
ownership
means
we
have
an
easier
time
we
will
take
advantage
of
opportunities
more
revenue
from
state
ads
