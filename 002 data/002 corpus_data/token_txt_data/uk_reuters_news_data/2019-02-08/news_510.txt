europe
may
need
to
impose
tougher
sanctions
against
moscow
following
russia
s
seizure
of
ukrainian
vessels
an
ally
of
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
on
tuesday
ukraine
president
petro
poroshenko
has
warned
of
the
extremely
serious
threat
of
a
land
invasion
after
russia
seized
three
ukrainian
naval
ships
and
took
their
crew
prisoner
at
the
weekend
norbert
roettgen
a
member
of
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
christian
democratic
union
who
chairs
the
german
parliamentary
foreign
affairs
committee
said
russia
s
behaviour
was
deeply
worrying
and
that
tougher
sanctions
were
an
option
so
far
there
are
no
talks
about
tougher
sanctions
but
i
generally
would
not
rule
this
out
roettgen
told
deutschlandfunk
radio
in
my
view
such
behaviour
can
not
remain
without
consequences
and
i
don
t
think
one
should
say
that
there
won
t
be
any
further
merkel
has
stressed
the
need
for
dialogue
while
the
european
union
britain
france
poland
denmark
and
canada
all
condemned
what
they
called
russian
aggression
