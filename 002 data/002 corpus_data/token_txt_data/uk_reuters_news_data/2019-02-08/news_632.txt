an
investor

on
its
billion
acquisition

next
month
and
aims
to
close
the

on
signaling
its
confidence
in
securing
the
required
support
shares
in
shire
rose
percent
on
the
news
hitting
their
highest
level
since
takeda
first
disclosed
its
interest
in
buying
the
rare
diseases
specialist
in
march
the
deal
would
be
the
overseas
acquisition
by
a
japanese
company
but
it
needs
support
from
shareholders
some
of
whom
are
worried
about
the
enlarged
company
s
resulting
debt
burden
takeda
said
on
monday
it
would
hold
an
extraordinary
general
meeting
egm
of
shareholders
to
vote
on
the
transaction
on
previously
takeda
had
said
it
hoped
to
hold
the
egm
early
in
leaving
uncertain
the
level
of
backing
for
the
deal
which
has
been
opposed
by
some
members
of
the
founding
takeda
family
with
the
date
of
our
extraordinary
general
meeting
of
shareholders
now
set
we
are
looking
forward
to
continue
our
dialogue
with
shareholders
regarding
the
compelling
strategic
and
financial
benefits
of
this
transaction
chief
executive
christophe
weber
said
weber
a
frenchman
and
the
first
ceo
of
the
company
believes
that
buying
shire
will
accelerate
takeda
s
growth
and
increase
its
international
reach
boosting
earnings
the
transaction
is
still
awaiting
approval
from
european
regulators
although
two
people
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
last
week
that
takeda
was
set
to
win
conditional
eu
antitrust
approval
takeda
has
offered
to
divest
shire
s
experimental
drug
to
address
concerns
about
overlap
in
inflammatory
bowel
disease
treatments
the
takeover
has
already
secured
clearance
from
regulators
in
the
united
states
japan
china
and
brazil
weber
said
last
week
he
was
confident
of
securing
investor
backing
for
the
purchase
of
shire
but
until
now
it
has
not
been
clear
when
exactly
takeda
would
call
its
egm
takeda
which
has
a
market
value
of
around
billion
has
secured
a
billion
bridge
loan
to
help
finance
the
shire
acquisition
and
some
investors
are
concerned
as
to
how
well
it
will
cope
with
debt
repayments
the
japanese
company
struck
its
agreement
to
take
over
shire
in
may
in
a
deal
that
will
propel
it
into
the
top
rankings
of
global
drugmakers
by
sales
however
the
enlarged
group
faces
significant
challenges
particularly
in
hemophilia
where
a
new
drug
from
roche
and
the
prospect
of
new
gene
therapies
now
in
development
threaten
a
key
part
of
shire
s
existing
business
