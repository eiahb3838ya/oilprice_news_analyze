ducey
will
appoint
a
member
of
his

party
to
succeed

funeral
that

also
give
republicans
a
slight
edge
in
the
battle
to

brett
kavanaugh
to
the
supreme
court
because
mccain
had
been
too
ill

alternatively
affable

cantankerous

in

public
eye
since

mccain
lost
to

said
in
a
statement
that
he
and
mccain
despite
their
different
backgrounds
and
political
views
shared
a
belief
in
american
ideals
we
saw
our
political
battles
even
as
a
privilege
something
noble
an
opportunity
to
serve
as
stewards
of
those
high
ideals
at
home
and
to
advance
them
around
the
world
obama
wrote
mccain
chairman
of
the
senate
armed
services
committee
was
a
frequent
critic
and
target
of
his
fellow
republican
trump
who
was
elected
president
in
november
mccain
denounced
trump
for
among
other
things
his
praise
of
russian
president
vladimir
putin
and
other
leaders
the
senator
described
as
foreign
flattery
secures
his
friendship
criticism
his
enmity
mccain
said
of
trump
in
his
memoir
the
restless
wave
which
was
released
in
may
mccain
castigated
trump
in
july
for
his
summit
with
putin
calling
their
joint
news
conference
in
helsinki
one
of
the
most
disgraceful
performances
by
an
american
president
in
defense
secretary
james
mattis
saluted
mccain
as
a
figure
who
always
put
service
to
the
nation
before
in
germany
whose
government
has
clashed
with
trump
over
a
range
of
issues
including
trade
and
defense
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
john
mccain
was
guided
by
the
firm
conviction
that
the
value
of
all
political
work
could
be
found
in
serving
freedom
democracy
and
the
rule
of
french
president
emmanuel
macron
called
mccain
a
true
american
hero
whose
voice
will
be
missed
and
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
said
he
embodied
the
idea
of
service
over
mccain
a
traditionally
republican
foreign
policy
hawk
was
admired
in
both
parties
for
championing
civility
and
compromise
during
an
era
of
acrid
partisanship
in
politics
but
he
also
had
a
famous
temper
and
rarely
shied
away
from
a
fight
including
several
with
trump
he
was
the
central
figure
in
one
of
the
most
dramatic
congressional
moments
in
trump
s
presidency
when
he
returned
to
washington
shortly
after
his
brain
cancer
diagnosis
for
a
vote
in
july
still
bearing
a
black
eye
and
scar
from
surgery
mccain
gave
a
signal
in
a
vote
to
scuttle
a
bill
that
would
have
repealed
the
obamacare
healthcare
law
and
increased
the
number
of
americans
without
health
insurance
by
millions
trump
was
furious
about
mccain
s
vote
and
frequently
referred
to
it
at
rallies
after
trump
launched
his
presidential
campaign
in
mccain
condemned
his
hardline
rhetoric
on
illegal
immigration
and
said
trump
had
fired
up
the
trump
retorted
that
mccain
was
not
a
war
hero
adding
i
like
people
who
weren
t
after
trump
became
president
mccain
blasted
what
he
called
the
president
s
attempts
to
undermine
the
free
press
and
rule
of
law
and
lamented
the
spurious
nationalism
of
the
trump
era

a
financial
crisis
it
was
a
stark
contrast

veteran
of
washington
and
the
obama
who
was
offering
a
yes
we
can
message
of
change

to
inject
some
youth
into
his
campaign
with
his
selection
of
