rockets
must
stop
restraint
must
be
shown
by
all
violence
has
simmered
since
palestinians
launched
weekly
border
protests
on
march
to
demand
the
easing
of
a
blockade
on
gaza
and
rights
to
lands
lost
in
the
war
of
israel
s
founding
israeli
troops
have
killed
more
that
palestinians
during
the
confrontations
which
have
included
border
breaches
a
qatari
cash
infusion
of

last

appeared
to
dampen
gazan
anger
on

israeli
prime

benjamin
netanyahu
said
he
hoped
to
reach
an
arrangement
to
avoid
another
gaza
war
and
ease
palestinian
economic
hardship
but
hours
later
a
botched
incursion
by
undercover
israeli
troops
in
gaza
led
to
fighting
that
killed
a
hamas
commander
six
other
palestinian
militants
and
an
israeli
colonel
in
response
to
yesterday
s
crime
the
joint
command
of
palestinian
factions
announce
the
beginning
of
bombardment
of
the
enemy
s
settlements
with
scores
of
rockets
hamas
said
in
a
statement
on
monday
in
an
apparent
attempt
to
defuse
tensions
israel
s
military
spokesman
said
the
special
forces
had
not
been
dispatched
to
assassinate
hamas
commanders
a
tactic
that
led
to
wider
conflict
in
the
past
and
which
has
largely
been
abandoned
israeli
media
reports
suggested
the
raid
was
mounted
to
gather
intelligence
hamas
which
is
branded
a
terrorist
group
in
the
west
and
israel
have
fought
three
wars
in
the
last
decade
and
neither
side
appeared
keen
to
precipitate
another
conflict
on
monday
palestinian
factions
placed
the
onus
on
israel
to
cease
fire
saying
they
were
prepared
to
increase
the
range
of
rocket
fire
for
as
long
as
the
air
barrage
on
gaza
persisted
but
the
israelis
jarred
by
dozens
of
civilian
casualties
in
their
border
communities
appeared
set
on
deterring
hamas
ronen
manelis
israel
s
military
spokesman
said
hamas
was
leading
gaza
to
ruin
and
that
israeli
attacks
on
it
would
intensify
to
the
degree
