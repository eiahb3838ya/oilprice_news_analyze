the
united
states
is
pushing
for
regular
reviews
of
china
s
progress
on
pledged
trade
reforms
as
a
condition
for
a
trade
deal
and
could
again
resort
to
tariffs
if
it
deems
beijing
has
violated
the
agreement
according
to
sources
briefed
on
negotiations
to
end
the
trade
war
between
the
two
nations
a
continuing
threat
of
tariffs
hanging
over
commerce
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
would
mean
a
deal
would
not
end
the
risk
of
investing
in
businesses
or
assets
that
have
been
impacted
by
the
trade
war
the
threat
of
tariffs
is
not
going
away
even
if
there
is
a
deal
said
one
of
three
sources
briefed
on
the
talks
who
spoke
with
reuters
on
condition
of
anonymity
chinese
negotiators
were
not
keen
on
the
idea
of
regular
compliance
checks
the
source
said
but
the
proposal
didn
t
derail
a
chinese
source
said
the
united
states
wants
periodic
assessments
but
it
s
not
yet
clear
how
often
it
looks
like
humiliation
the
source
said
but
perhaps
the
two
sides
could
find
a
way
to
save
face
for
the
chinese
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
has
imposed
import
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
to
put
pressure
on
beijing
to
meet
a
long
list
of
demands
that
would
rewrite
the
terms
of
trade
between
the
two
countries
the
demands
include
changes
to
china
s
policies
on
intellectual
property
protection
technology
transfers
industrial
subsidies
and
other
trade
barriers
an
enforcement
and
verification
process
is
unusual
for
trade
deals
and
is
akin
to
the
process
around
punitive
economic
sanctions
such
as
those
imposed
on
north
korea
and
iran
disputes
over
trade
are
more
typically
dealt
with
through
courts
the
world
trade
organization
wto
or
through
arbitration
panels
and
other
dispute
settlement
mechanisms
built
into
trade
agreements
trump
s
team
has
criticized
the
wto
for
failing
to
hold
china
accountable
for
not
executing
on
promised
market
reforms
the
has
also
criticized
the
wto
s
dispute
settlement
process
and
is
seeking
reforms
at
the
organization
for
an
explainer
on
how
the
talks
differ
from
any
other
trade
negotiation
see
regular
reviews
would
be
one
potential
solution
to
address
a
demand
from
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
for
ongoing
verification
of
any
trade
pact
between
the
two
countries
three
sources
familiar
with
the
talks
told
reuters
the
threat
of
tariffs
would
be
used
to
keep
reform
on
track
the
sources
said
lighthizer
is
leading
negotiations
with
china
a
ustr
spokesman
declined
to
comment
on
the
possibility
of
regular
assessments
the
idea
of
quarterly
reviews
was
part
of
a
negotiating
document
leaked
after
talks
in
may
before
the
united
states
had
slapped
its
first
round
of
duties
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
the
renewed
focus
on
regular
reviews
in
current
negotiations
this
time
carrying
the
threat
of
tariffs
underscores
the
growing
distrust
between
the
two
countries
the
extra
scrutiny
is
needed
and
should
be
based
on
clear
benchmarks
with
consequence
for
failing
to
meet
them
said
erin
ennis
senior
vice
president
of
the
business
council
a
trade
group
representing
american
companies
doing
business
in
china
it
needs
to
be
tied
to
removing
or
reducing
the
tariffs
ennis
said
if
china
can
show
compliance
through
a
process
like
this
it
would
also
be
a
measure
for
both
trump
s
administration
has
accused
china
of
repeatedly
failing
to
follow
through
on
previous
pledges
to
implement
reforms
sought
by
the
united
states
washington
often
cites
as
an
example
the
difficulties
still
faced
by
foreign
payment
card
operators
in
entering
china
s
market
despite
a
wto
ruling
that
beijing
was
discriminating
against
them
a
separate
industry
source
said
it
is
likely
that
different
agreement
on
separate
issues
forced
technology
transfer
intellectual
property
changes
to
china
s
legal
system
would
require
separate
verification
processes
all
of
which
will
need
to
be
hammered
out
by
negotiators
the
challenge
of
verification
and
enforcement
stems
from
the
fact
that
china
has
made
promises
it
hasn
t
kept
the
source
said
trump
and
chinese
president
xi
jinping
agreed
to
a
truce
in
the
trade
war
in
december
to
give
their
teams
time
to
negotiate
a
deal
nearly
days
later
there
is
little
sign
that
china
will
make
the
concessions
the

lighthizer

no
progress
on
structural
issues
at

days
of

week
