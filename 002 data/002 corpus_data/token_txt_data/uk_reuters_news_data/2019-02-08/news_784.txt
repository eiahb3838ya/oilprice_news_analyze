may tries to calm brexit rebels, says deal almost done
london
reuters
prime
minister
theresa
may
urged
restive
lawmakers
to
back
her
in
the
final
stages
of
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
saying
talks
were
in
their
most
difficult
phase
even
if
a
deal
was
close
after
facing
some
of
the
fiercest
attacks
to
date
over
her
brexit
plans
since
again
failing
to
clinch
a
deal
at
an
eu
summit
last
week
may
tried
to
calm
passions
in
parliament
where
her
strategy
has
angered
eurosceptics
and
eu
supporters
alike
serving
our
national
interest
will
demand
that
we
hold
our
nerve
through
these
last
stages
of
the
negotiations
the
hardest
part
of
all
may
told
parliament
financial
markets
seized
on
the
possibility
that
may
could
be
toppled
as
prime
minister
by
rebels
in
her
conservative
party
driving
sterling
below
to
its
lowest
since
with
just
over
five
months
until
britain
is
scheduled
to
exit
the
eu
talks
have
stalled
over
a
disagreement
on
the
northern
irish
backstop
an
insurance
policy
to
ensure
there
will
be
no
return
to
a
hard
border
on
the
island
of
ireland
if
a
future
trading
relationship
is
not
agreed
in
time
but
may
s
attempt
to
unlock
the
talks
by
considering
an
extension
to
a
transition
period
beyond
the
current
proposed
end
date
of
december
has
further
riled
both
and
factions
in
her
deeply
split
conservative
party
may
again
dismissed
the
eu
s
proposed
backstop
as
unacceptable
and
she
set
out
two
options
for
britain
to
choose
from
an
extension
to
the
transition
period
or
a
temporary
customs
territory
which
was
first
outlined
earlier
this
year
may
said
the
eu
had
made
a
substantial
shift
on
the
latter
option
eu
sources
told
reuters
negotiators
were
looking
at
ways
to
promise
britain
a
customs
deal
that
could
stretch
brussels
brexit
red
lines
but
might
break
a
deadlock
in
an
attempt
to
highlight
how
much
progress
has
been
made
in
more
than
a
year
of
talks
with
the
eu
she
told
parliament
the
government
has
reached
agreement
on
everything
from
gibraltar
to
future
security
over
the
last
three
weeks
taking
all
of
this
together
per
cent
of
the
withdrawal
agreement
and
its
protocols
are
now
settled
she
said
but
the
deal
the
terms
of
britain
s
divorce
can
not
be
signed
off
until
the
two
sides
settle
on
future
management
of
the
border
between
northern
ireland
and
eu
member
state
ireland
british
and
eu
leaders
are
committed
to
avoiding
obstacles
at
the
border
a
crucial
aspect
of
the
good
friday
peace
deal
that
ended
decades
of
irish
sectarian
bloodshed
the
eu
proposal
for
northern
ireland
to
remain
in
the
bloc
s
customs
union
has
been
rejected
by
may
as
it
would
potentially
create
barriers
to
trade
with
the
rest
of
britain
something
ruled
out
by
northern
ireland
s
dup
party
whose
votes
in
parliament
prop
up
may
s
government
at
an
eu
summit
in
brussels
last
week
any
agreement
seemed
just
as
far
off
as
it
did
months
earlier
with
eu
officials
and
diplomats
saying
that
may
had
offered
nothing
new
to
ease
the
deadlock
since
then
her
proposal
to
extend
the
transition
period
has
stoked
anger
among
conservative
eurosceptics
who
fear
she
is
leading
britain
into
a
deal
that
will
make
britain
a
vassal
state
indefinitely
unable
ever
to
fully
leave
the
eu
or
to
forge
its
own
free
trade
deals
with
other
countries
critics
of
may
used
britain
s
sunday
newspapers
to
rhetorically
savage
the
british
leader
with
unnamed
rivals
using
phrases
such
as
assassination
is
in
the
air
however
that
approach
looked
to
have
backfired
as
even
may
s
harshest
critics
condemned
the
violent
nature
of
the
comments
tempering
any
confrontation
with
their
leader
a
vote
of
in
may
would
be
triggered
if
conservative
lawmakers
submit
letters
to
the
chairman
of
the
party
s
committee
of
backbenchers
to
demand
such
a
vote
the
sunday
times
said
had
now
been
sent
but
reuters
could
not
verify
that
number
however
a
planned
show
of
strength
among
the
brexiteers
who
intended
to
rebel

a
vote
