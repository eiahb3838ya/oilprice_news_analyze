g20, forged in crisis, faces major test next week - donald trump
aires
reuters
when
world
leaders
met
for
the
first
time
in
their
mission
was
a
desperate
one
to
rescue
the
global
economy
from
the
worst
financial
crisis
in
more
than
years
they
were
successful
ten
years
on
that
picture
of
unity
in
the
face
of
economic
calamity
is
in
the
mirror
leaders
of
the
industrialized
nations
meeting
in
argentina
next
week
are
expected
to
struggle
to
agree
on
a
joint
statement
on
two
of
the
biggest
and
thorniest
global
issues
on
their
agenda
trade
and
climate
change
officials
in
european
and
asian
capitals
helping
to
prepare
for
the
meeting
said
they
were
cautiously
optimistic
that
a
communique
would
be
issued
when
the
meeting
ends
on
but
many
said
it
would
likely
be
watered
down
to
try
to
ensure
approval
from
president
donald
trump
an
avowed
skeptic
of
climate
change
who
has
adopted
protectionist
trade
policies
and
a
more
isolationist
foreign
policy
recent
history
suggests
those
who
draft
the
communique
face
a
tough
challenge
when
they
begin
their
work
in
earnest
in
buenos
aires
on
monday
last
weekend
officials
from
countries
attending
a
major
summit
failed
to
agree
on
a
joint
communique
for
the
first
time
as
the
united
states
clashed
with
china
over
trade
and
security
in
may
trump
rejected
a
statement
by
fellow
leaders
of
the
industrialized
economies
after
a
tense
gathering
ended
in
acrimony
again
over
tariffs
and
trade
it
s
a
club
that
is
even
more
difficult
to
manage
than
the
said
a
french
diplomatic
source
let
s
face
it
the
issues
are
difficult
the
talks
have
been
difficult
since
last
year
it
will
be
the
case
again
this
year
maybe
even
it
will
be
the
first
time
the
leaders
have
met
since
trump
imposed
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
imports
to
force
concessions
from
beijing
on
greater
access
to
chinese
markets
forced
technology
transfer
and
intellectual
property
theft
china
responded
with
import
tariffs
on
goods
the
organisation
for
economic
and
development
oecd
warned
this
week
that
an
escalation
in
the
trade
war
the
tariff
rate
on
billion
in
chinese
goods
is
set
to
increase
to
percent
from
percent
on
would
impede
global
economic
growth
officials
from
some
countries
anxious
to
see
a
swift
end
to
the
trade
war
are
hopeful
but
not
confident
that
a
meeting
between
trump
and
chinese
president
xi
jinping
on
the
sidelines
of
may
yield
at
least
a
partial
ceasefire
but
in
the
united
states
and
china
there
is
pessimism
within
the
white
house
there
is
uncertainty
over
how
hard
trump
is
prepared
to
push
xi
during
their
talks
on
trade
and
other
disputes
as
the
president
sorts
through
sometimes
conflicting
advice
from
his
own
top
aides
a
senior
trump
official
said
expectations
on
the
meeting
are
low
but
keeping
the
personal
relationship
going
is
an
extremely
high
priority
the
official
said
referring
to
trump
and
xi
who
have
sought
to
forge
a
close
working
relationship
despite
the
tensions
between
their
countries
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
china
s
main
goal
at
the
is
to
get
the
united
states
to
refrain
from
raising
the
tariffs
in
january
said
chinese
economists
and
academics
but
xi
would
not
be
bullied
into
making
a
bad
deal
even
if
they
are
able
to
reach
a
small
agreement
the
leaders
of
china
and
the
united
states
can
not
reach
a
fundamental
agreement
so
there
would
not
be
a
ceasefire
in
the
trade
war
said
shi
yinhong
the
head
of
the
center
for
american
studies
at
beijing
s
elite
renmin
university
who
has
advised
the
chinese
government
on
diplomacy
trump
said
on
thursday
he
was
well
prepared
for
his
meeting
with
xi
it
s
not
like
oh
gee
i
m
going
to
sit
down
and
i
know
every
ingredient
i
know
every
stat
i
know
it
better
than
anybody
knows
it
and
my
gut
has
always
been
right
and
we
re
doing
very
well
and
i
will
tell
you
china
very
much
wants
to
make
a
trump
will
also
meet
russian
president
vladimir
putin
the
two
leaders
have
not
met
face
to
face
since
a
bilateral
summit
in
july
in
helsinki
that
prompted
trump
critics
to
accuse
him
of
cozying
up
to
the
kremlin
leaders
are
also
expected
to
discuss
reform
of
the
world
trade
organization
but
officials
said
it
was
unlikely
any
agreement
would
be
reached
the
united
states
is
increasingly
skeptical
of
the
wto
s
ability
to
resolve
international
trade
disputes
the
european
union
is
also
pushing
to
reform
the
body
to
make
it
better
able
to
address
modern
trade
problems
european
countries
are
anxious
that
the
final
communique
refer
to
the
fight
against
climate
change
a
senior
european
union
official
said
trump
has
announced
his
intention
to
withdraw
the
united
states
from
the
paris
climate
accord
casting
doubt
on
the
science
underpinning
the
agreement
despite
disagreements
on
key
issues
and
the
united
states
growing
skepticism
about
the
usefulness
of
multilateral
bodies
members
insist
the
forum
remains
an
important
opportunity
for
world
leaders
to
meet
and
exchange
views
on
pressing
issues
its
existence
itself
helps
us
gather
quickly
and
discuss
key
issues
on
a
global
level
when
needed
said
a
senior
official
in
asia
a
senior
german
official
involved
in
preparations
said
germany
remained
committed
to
as
a
place
for
multilateral
and
bilateral
discussions
despite
the
current
tensions
sometimes
you
have
to
be
patient
there
is
no
alternative
anyway
than
to
try
to
work
together
