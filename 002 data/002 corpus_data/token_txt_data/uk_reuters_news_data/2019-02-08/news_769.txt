reuters
president
donald
trump
said
on
tuesday
saudi
authorities
staged
the
worst
ever
in
the
killing
of
prominent
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
this
month
as
the
united
states
vowed
to
revoke
the
visas
of
some
of
those
believed
to
be
responsible
trump
spoke
hours
after
turkey
s
president
tayyip
erdogan
dismissed
saudi
efforts
to
blame
khashoggi
s
death
on
rogue
operatives
erdogan
urged
riyadh
to
search
from
top
to
bottom
to
uncover
those
behind
khashoggi
s
death
in
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
on
an
incident
that
has
sparked
global
outrage
and
strained
relations
between
riyadh
and
washington
for
saudi
arabia
s
allies
the
question
will
be
whether
they
believe
that
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
who
has
painted
himself
as
a
reformer
has
any
culpability
trump
said
the
killing
and
subsequent
by
saudi
arabia
were
a
total
there
should
have
never
been
an
execution
or
a
because
it
should
have
never
happened
trump
told
reporters
he
said
he
had
spoken
on
monday
with
the
crown
prince
who
denied
having
anything
to
do
with
khashoggi
s
killing
earlier
trump
said
the
khashoggi
matter
was
handled
badly
by
saudi
officials
bad
deal
should
have
never
been
thought
of
somebody
really
messed
up
and
they
had
the
worst
ever
trump
told
reporters
at
the
white
house
khashoggi
a
critic
of
the
crown
prince
was
a
resident
and
washington
post
columnist
trump
s
comments
in
recent
days
have
ranged
from
threatening
saudi
arabia
with
very
severe
consequences
and
mentioning
possible
economic
sanctions
to
more
conciliatory
remarks
highlighting
the
country
s
role
as
a
ally
against
iran
and
islamist
militants
as
well
as
a
major
purchaser
of
arms
trump
did
not
give
his
views
on
who
was
ultimately
responsible
but
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
the
united
states
had
identified
some
of
the
saudi
government
and
security
officials
it
believed
were
involved
in
khashoggi
s
murder
and
would
take
appropriate
actions
including
revoking
visas
the
state
department
said
saudis
would
have
their
visas
revoked
or
be
made
ineligible
for
visas
another
official
said
the
vast
majority
of
the
group
had
visas
as
we
continue
to
develop
our
understanding
of
the
individuals
that
were
responsible
for
this
not
only
those
who
executed
it
but
those
who
were
connected
to
it
the
world
should
know
that
we
intend
to
hold
those
individuals
accountable
when
we
develop
this
fact
set
pompeo
told
reporters
pompeo
also
said
the
state
department
was
looking
into
whether
sanctions
could
be
applicable
for
those
found
to
be
involved
these
penalties
will
not
be
the
last
word
on
this
matter
from
the
united
states
pompeo
said
although
he
emphasized
as
have
other
senior
officials
the
importance
of
the
relationship
neither
the
president
nor
i
are
happy
with
this
the
saudi
embassy
in
washington
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
the
measures
as
the
crisis
unfolded
over
the
past
three
weeks
saudi
arabia
changed
its
tune
on
khashoggi
riyadh
initially
denied
knowledge
of
khashoggi
s
fate
before
saying
on
saturday
he
was
killed
in
a
fight
in
the
consulate
an
account
met
with
skepticism
from
several
western
governments
straining
their
relations
with
the
world
s
biggest
oil
exporter
saudi
arabia
has
detained
people
and
dismissed
five
senior
government
officials
as
part
of
an
investigation
into
khashoggi
s
death
one
of
those
fired
includes
saud
a
top
aide
who
ran
social
media
for
prince
mohammed
according
to
two
intelligence
sources
qahtani
ran
khashoggi
s
killing
by
giving
orders
over
skype
turkish
security
sources
say
that
when
khashoggi
entered
the
consulate
he
was
seized
by
saudi
intelligence
operatives
who
had
flown
in
on
two
jets
just
hours
before
erdogan
on
tuesday
stopped
short
of
mentioning
the
crown
prince
who
some
lawmakers
suspect
ordered
the
killing
the
saudi
administration
has
taken
an
important
step
by
admitting
to
the
murder
from
now
on
we
expect
them
to
uncover
all
those
responsible
for
this
matter
from
top
to
bottom
and
make
them
face
the
necessary
punishments
erdogan
said
in
a
speech
in
parliament
from
the
person
who
gave
the
order
to
the
person
who
carried
it
out
they
must
all
be
brought
to
account
turkey
s
president
said
turkish
sources
have
said
that
authorities
have
an
audio
recording
purportedly
documenting
the
killing
erdogan
made
no
reference
to
any
audio
recording
a
saudi
cabinet
meeting
chaired
by
king
salman
said
riyadh
would
hold
to
account
those
responsible
for
the
killing
and
those
who
failed
in
their
duties
whoever
they
were
turkish
investigators
searched
a
saudi
consulate
vehicle
in
istanbul
that
contained
two
suitcases
and
other
items
according
to
broadcaster
cnn
turk
it
was
not
clear
what
was
in
the
suitcases
trump
said
he
would
work
with
the
congress
to
determine
the
response
to
the
khashoggi
matter
in
terms
of
what
we
ultimately
do
i
m
going
to
leave
it
very
much
in
conjunction
with
me
up
to
congress
trump
said
adding
he
would
like
a
bipartisan
recommendation
cia
director
gina
haspel
in
turkey
to
investigate
the
death
of
khashoggi
has
sought
to
hear
the
purported
audio
recording
of
his
torture
and
murder
four
sources
familiar
with
her
mission
told
reuters
on
tuesday
a
host
of
western
executives
and
governments
have
pulled
out
of
a
saudi
investment
summit
that
started
on
tuesday
because
of
the
khashoggi
affair
erdogan
said
the
killing
was
planned
from
when
khashoggi
first
went
to
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
on
to
obtain
documents
necessary
for
his
marriage
he
was
told
he
would
need
to
return
later
to
collect
the
documents
a
day
before
khashoggi
s
death
agents
arrived
from
overseas
and
began
to
scout
locations
including
the
belgrad
forest
near
istanbul
and
the
city
of
yalova
to
its
south
erdogan
said
police
have
searched
both
areas
for
evidence
of
khashoggi
s
remains
reuters
has
reported
on
the
day
khashoggi
arrived
for
his
appointment
and
was
later
killed
the
hard
disk
in
the
consulate
s
camera
system
was
removed
erdogan
said
covering
up
a
savage
murder
like
this
will
only
hurt
the
human
conscience
we
expect
the
same
sensitivity
from
all
parties
primarily
the
saudi
arabian
leadership
he
said
we
have
strong
signs
that
the
murder
was
the
result
of
a
planned
operation
not
a
