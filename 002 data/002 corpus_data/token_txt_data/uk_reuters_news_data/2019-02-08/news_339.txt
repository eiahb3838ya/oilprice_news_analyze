washington
reuters
a
judge
fiercely
criticized
president
donald
trump
s
former
national
security
adviser
michael
flynn
on
tuesday
for
lying
to
fbi
agents
in
a
probe
into
russian
interference
in
the
election
and
delayed
sentencing
him
until
flynn
has
finished
helping
prosecutors
district
judge
emmet
sullivan
told
flynn
a
retired
army
lieutenant
general
and
former
director
of
the
defense
intelligence
agency
that
he
had
arguably
betrayed
his
country
sullivan
also
noted
that
flynn
had
operated
as
an
undeclared
lobbyist
for
turkey
even
as
he
worked
on
trump
s
campaign
team
and
prepared
to
be
his
white
house
national
security
adviser
flynn
pleaded
guilty
to
lying
to
fbi
agents
about
his
december
conversations
with
sergei
kislyak
then
russia
s
ambassador
in
washington
about
sanctions
imposed
on
moscow
by
the
administration
of
trump
s
democratic
predecessor
barack
obama
the
conversations
took
place
between
trump
s
november
election
victory
and
his
inauguration
in
january
special
counsel
robert
mueller
leading
the
investigation
into
possible
collusion
between
trump
s
campaign
and
russia
ahead
of
the
election
had
asked
the
judge
not
to
sentence
flynn
to
prison
because
he
had
already
provided
substantial
cooperation
over
the
course
of
many
interviews
lying
to
the
fbi
carries
a
statutory
maximum
sentence
of
five
years
in
prison
flynn
s
plea
agreement
stated
that
he
was
eligible
for
a
sentence
of
between
zero
and
six
months
sullivan
sternly
told
flynn
his
actions
were
abhorrent
noting
that
flynn
had
also
lied
to
senior
white
house
officials
who
in
turn
misled
the
public
the
judge
said
he
had
read
additional
facts
about
flynn
s
behaviour
that
have
not
been
made
public
at
one
point
sullivan
asked
prosecutors
if
flynn
could
have
been
charged
with
treason
although
the
judge
later
said
he
had
not
been
suggesting
such
a
charge
was
warranted
arguably
you
sold
your
country
out
sullivan
told
flynn
i
m
not
hiding
my
disgust
my
disdain
for
this
criminal
flynn
dressed
in
a
suit
and
tie
showed
little
emotion
throughout
the
hearing
and
spoke
calmly
when
he
confirmed
his
guilty
plea
and
answered
questions
from
the
judge
sullivan
appeared
ready
to
sentence
flynn
to
prison
but
then
gave
him
the
option
of
a
delay
in
his
sentencing
so
he
could
fully
cooperate
with
any
pending
investigations
and
bolster
his
case
for
leniency
the
judge
told
flynn
he
could
not
promise
that
he
would
not
eventually
sentence
him
to
serve
prison
time
flynn
accepted
that
offer
sullivan
did
not
set
a
new
date
for
sentencing
but
asked
mueller
s
team
and
flynn
s
attorney
to
give
him
a
status
report
by
march
sullivan
later
imposed
travel
restrictions
on
flynn
ordering
him
to
surrender
his
passport
and
to
obtain
court
permission
before
travelling
outside
the
washington
area
the
curbs
are
typical
for
people
released
on
their
own
recognizance
the
judge
said
prosecutors
said
flynn
already
had
provided
most
of
the
cooperation
he
could
but
it
was
possible
he
might
be
able
to
help
investigators
further
flynn
s
attorney
said
his
client
is
cooperating
with
federal
prosecutors
in
a
case
against
bijan
rafiekian
his
former
business
partner
who
has
been
charged
with
unregistered
lobbying
for
turkey
rafiekian
pleaded
not
guilty
on
tuesday
to
those
charges
in
federal
court
in
alexandria
virginia
his
trial
is
scheduled
for
flynn
is
expected
to
testify
prosecutors
have
said
rafiekian
and
flynn
lobbied
to
have
washington
extradite
a
muslim
cleric
who
lives
in
the
united
states
and
is
accused
by
turkey
s
government
of
backing
a
coup
attempt
flynn
has
not
been
charged
in
that
case
flynn
was
a
adviser
to
trump
s
campaign
team
at
the
republican
party
s
national
convention
in
flynn
led
trump
s
supporters
in
cries
of
lock
her
up
directed
against
democratic
candidate
hillary
clinton
a
group
of
protesters
including
some
who
chanted
lock
him
up
gathered
outside
the
courthouse
on
tuesday
along
with
a
large
inflatable
rat
fashioned
to
look
like
trump
several
flynn
supporters
also
were
there
cheering
as
he
entered
and
exited
one
held
a
sign
that
read
michael
flynn
is
a
flynn
became
national
security
adviser
when
trump
took
office
in
january
but
lasted
only
days
before
being
fired
he
told
fbi
investigators
on
that
he
had
not
discussed
the
sanctions
with
kislyak
when
in
fact
he
had
according
to
his
plea
agreement
trump
has
said
he
fired
flynn
because
he
also
lied
to
vice
president
mike
pence
about
the
contacts
with
kislyak
trump
has
said
flynn
did
not
break
the
law
and
has
voiced
support
for
him
raising
speculation
the
republican
president
might
pardon
him
good
luck
today
in
court
to
general
michael
flynn
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
he
has
to
say
despite
tremendous
pressure
being
put
on
him
about
russian
collusion
in
our
great
and
obviously
highly
successful
political
campaign
there
was
no
collusion
trump
wrote
on
twitter
on
tuesday
morning
after
the
hearing
white
house
spokeswoman
sarah
sanders
told
reporters
the
fbi
had
ambushed
flynn
in
the
way
agents
questioned
him
but
said
his
activities
at
the
centre
of
the
case
don
t
have
anything
to
do
with
the
president
and
disputed
that
flynn
had
committed
treason
we
wish
general
flynn
well
sanders
said
in
contrast
trump
has
called
his
former
personal
lawyer
michael
cohen
who
has
pleaded
guilty
to
separate
charges
a
mueller
s
investigation
into
russia
s
role
in
the
election
and
whether
trump
has
unlawfully
sought
to
obstruct
the
probe
has
cast
a
shadow
over
his
presidency
several
former
trump
aides
have
pleaded
guilty
in
mueller
s
probe
but
flynn
was
the
first
former
trump
white
house
official
to
do
so
mueller
also
has
charged
a
series
of
russian
individuals
and
entities
trump
has
called
mueller
s
investigation
a
witch
hunt
and
has
denied
collusion
with
moscow
russia
has
denied
meddling
in
the
election
contrary
to
the
conclusion
of
intelligence
agencies
that
have
said
moscow
used
hacking
and
propaganda
to
try
to
sow
discord
in
the
united
states
and
boost
trump
s
chances
