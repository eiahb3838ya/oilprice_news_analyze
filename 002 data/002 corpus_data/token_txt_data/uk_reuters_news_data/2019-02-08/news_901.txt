no siren, no warning - indonesians caught unawares by devastating tsunami
indonesia
reuters
when
up
to
tsunami
waves
crashed
into
the
indonesian
city
of
palu
last
month
didiek
wahyudi
kurniawan
s
house
near
the
beach
was
quickly
engulfed
with
water
leaving
his
wife
and
two
daughters
barely
any
time
to
escape
i
know
there
is
supposed
to
be
a
tsunami
warning
alarm
but
maybe
it
was
outdated
i
have
no
idea
we
never
get
any
warning
from
it
said
kurniawan
he
said
he
was
out
at
the
time
but
his
family
escaped
by
wading
through
water
to
a
neighbour
s
building
while
his
family
was
spared
scores
attending
a
beach
festival
in
palu
were
among
those
swept
away
adding
to
the
more
than
deaths
from
the
magnitude
quake
and
tsunami
that
have
been
confirmed
so
far
other
survivors
also
said
they
heard
no
sirens
even
though
a
tsunami
warning
was
issued
and
then
lifted
minutes
after
the
quake
based
on
data
available
from
the
closest
tidal
sensor
around
km
miles
from
palu
which
is
on
sulawesi
island
as
indonesia
struggles
with
the
aftermath
of
the
devastating
quake
the
spotlight
has
again
been
shone
on
the
apparent
lack
of
preparedness
in
a
sprawling
archipelago
that
suffers
regular
tremors
lying
on
the
seismically
active
pacific
ring
of
fire
there
was
a
major
push
in
the
region
to
improve
warning
systems
after
the
indian
ocean
tsunami
killed
more
than
in
indonesia
alone
including
establishing
a
network
of
warning
buoys
to
detect
tsunamis
that
was
put
in
place
with
german
and
help
international
agencies
and
countries
poured
billion
into
the
reconstruction
of
indonesia
s
devastated
aceh
province
on
sumatra
island
with
new
infrastructure
such
as
strategically
placed
evacuation
centres
still
with
the
first
waves
in
palu
arriving
within
around
four
minutes
and
power
and
communications
knocked
out
by
the
quake
text
message
alerts
or
sirens
would
probably
not
have
been
enough
even
if
they
were
working
denis
mcclean
a
spokesman
of
the
disaster
risk
reduction
agency
told
a
briefing
only
public
awareness
would
have
saved
people
under
these
circumstances
it
happened
very
quickly
there
wasn
t
much
time
for
warnings
to
be
disseminated
so
it
was
very
much
dependent
on
the
level
of
public
awareness
in
order
to
save
indonesia
s
national
disaster
mitigation
agency
spokesman
sutopo
purwo
nugroho
said
people
still
often
did
not
know
what
to
do
when
a
disaster
strikes
unlike
in
countries
like
japan
and
new
zealand
earthquake
education
and
drills
are
conducted
only
sporadically
in
indonesia
the
problem
in
tsunami
early
warning
systems
is
not
the
structure
not
its
tools
but
the
culture
in
our
communities
nugroho
told
reporters
palu
has
some
tsunami
evacuation
route
signs
but
mokhtar
a
resident
said
while
he
was
aware
of
government
sponsored
simulations
shown
on
television
on
what
to
do
in
an
earthquake
he
had
not
seen
any
on
the
ground
there
is
a
warning
system
but
on
that
day
there
was
none
no
siren
or
anything
said
the
civil
servant
adding
that
he
has
never
heard
the
warning
system
ever
nugroho
of
the
disaster
agency
said
communities
sometimes
vandalise
early
warning
tools
like
tsunami
buoys
the
network
of
buoys
in
indonesia
which
are
connected
to
seabed
sensors
have
been
inoperable
since
often
due
to
neglect
or
vandalism
fishermen
often
used
buoys
to
tie
their
boats
sometimes
damaging
sensors
while
in
one
case
a
buoy
was
towed
by
fishermen
from
its
original
mooring
to
another
part
of
the
sea
off
sulawesi
indonesian
president
joko
widodo
called
this
week
for
the
buoys
to
be
repaired
or
replaced
but
experts
and
officials
say
investment
has
also
been
neglected
in
other
areas
according
to
data
from
the
disaster
agency
out
of
about
tsunami
sirens
needed
across
indonesia
only
are
in
place
only
about
km
miles
of
evacuation
routes
have
been
established
against
a
need
for
km
miles
while
there
are
only
evacuation
shelters
compared
with
estimates
of
needed
the
data
showed
the
speaker
of
indonesia
s
parliament
bambang
soesatyo
pledged
in
a
statement
that
at
least
in
the
case
of
buoys
parliament
would
support
the
budget
for
this
adam
switzer
a
tsunami
expert
at
the
earth
observatory
of
singapore
said
from
evidence
so
far
it
appeared
the
tsunami
in
palu
was
generated
by
a
submarine
landslide
something
most
warning
systems
would
not
pick
up
the
earthquake
is
the
warning
the
first
thing
you
need
to
do
is
take
cover
in
a
safe
space
until
the
shaking
stops
and
then
get
yourself
away
from
the
coast
it
s
about
education
said
switzer
stressing
that
this
needed
to
be
ingrained
in
every
child
in
asia
especially
in
southeast
asia
even
putting
aside
the
human
cost
there
are
powerful
economic
arguments
for
doing
more
to
prepare
for
disasters
udrekh
a
disaster
expert
at
indonesia
s
agency
for
the
assessment
and
application
of
technology
bppt
said
indonesia
is
discussing
with
japan
whether
to
invest
in
seabed
cables
with
sensors
that
could
detect
tsunami
and
earthquakes
similar
to
a
system
in
japan
such
cables
would
be
less
vulnerable
and
quicker
than
buoys
and
cost
billion
rupiah
million
a
year
for
every
km
miles
he
said
we
always
say
for
disaster
infrastructure
that
you
save
for
every
investment
you
make
so
this
is
needed
and
the
cost
is
nothing
compared
to
other
infrastructure
he
said
he
estimated
indonesia
lost
about
trillion
rupiah
billion
each
year
from
disasters
but
spent
too
little
on
disaster
mitigation
infrastructure
and
education
it
s
like
we
never
learned
from
he
