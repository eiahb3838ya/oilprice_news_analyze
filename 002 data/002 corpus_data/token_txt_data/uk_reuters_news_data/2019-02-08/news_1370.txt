an
ebola
outbreak
in
eastern
democratic
republic
of
congo
is
likely
spread
over
tens
of
kilometres
and
poses
a
high
regional
risk
given
its
proximity
to
borders
a
world
health

four

mostly
in

just
last
week
a
previous
outbreak
on
the
other
side
of
the
central
african
country
was
declared
over
after
killing
people
it
would
appear
that
the
risk
as
we
can
surmise
for
drc
is
high
for
the
region
it
s
high
given
the
proximity
to
borders
particularly
uganda
said
who
s
emergency
response
chief
peter
salama
we
are
talking
about
tens
of
kilometres
but
i
stress
that
this
is
very
preliminary
information
at
this
ebola
is
believed
to
be
transported
long
distances
by
bats
and
can
find
its
way
into
bush
meat
sold
at
local
markets
and
eaten
once
present
in
humans
it
causes
haemorrhagic
fever
vomiting
and
diarrhoea
and
is
spread
through
direct
contact
with

fluids
over
people
died
of
an
epidemic
in
west
africa
from

this
is
the
vast
forested
central
african
country
s
outbreak
since
when
the
virus
was
discovered
near
congo
s
ebola
river
in
the
north
that
is
more
than
twice
as
many
epidemics
as
any
other
country
the
response
to
congo
s
previous
outbreak
was
considered
a
success
despite
the
deaths
as
the
use
of
a
vaccine
made
by
merck
helped
contain
the
virus
the
kind
of
ebola
in
the
latest

has
been
confirmed
as
the
zaire
strain
that
the
merck
vaccine
protects
against
congo
s
health
ministry
said
late
on

this
should
allow
health

to
again
use
what
has
become
the
greatest
weapon
against
ebola
epidemics
to
date
still
this
outbreak
poses
new
challenges
eastern
congo
is
a
tinderbox
of
conflicts
over
land

this
could
hamper
efforts
to
contain
the
virus

been
killed
