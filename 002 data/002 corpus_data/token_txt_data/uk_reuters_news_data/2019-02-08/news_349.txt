welcomed
on
monday
the
british
government
s
response
to
a
review
into
workplace
rights
which
looks
set
to
preserve
the
business
models
of
gig
economy
companies
but
unions
rubbished
the
business
ministry
s
plans
firms
like
uber
for
its
service
and
food
courier
deliveroo
have
been
criticized
for
hiring
workers
on
a
basis
which
means
they
are
not
entitled
to
many
workplace
rights
including
the
minimum
wage
uber
and
taxi
service
addison
lee
have
lost
court
battles
over
the
issue
a
review
looked
into
the
matter
of
modern
workplace
practices
and
in
response
on
monday
the
business
ministry
said
it
would
legislate
to
improve
the
clarity
of
the
employment
status
tests
the
government
said
its
reforms
reflect
the
review
s
findings
that
completely
banning
zero
hours
contracts
which
offer
no
guarantees
on
working
hours
would
negatively
impact
some
people
and
that
the
flexibility
of
gig
working
was
not
incompatible
with
access
to
employment
protections
we
welcome
more
clarity
from
the
government
and
look
forward
to
working
closely
with
them
to
make
sure
drivers
can
keep
all
the
benefits
that
come
from
being
your
own
boss
said
an
uber
spokeswoman
deliveroo
said
it
would
work
with
the
government
to
ensure
the
interests
of
its
riders
can
be
advanced
but
britain
s
biggest
trade
union
unite
criticized
the
government
s
plans
people
on
zero
hour
contracts
and
workers
in
the
insecure
economy
need
much
more
than
a
weak
right
to
request
a
contract
and
more
predictable
hours
said
general
secretary
len
mccluskey
the
independent
workers
union
of
great
britain
which
has
won
court
cases
against
uber
on
worker
rights
but
recently
lost
to
deliveroo
was
similarly
downbeat
exploited
workers
in
this
country
are
sick
of
press
releases
rhetoric
and
government
announcements
said
general
secretary
jason
as
part
of
the
plans
britain
s
governing
conservatives
will
introduce
legislation
to
scrap
the
swedish
derogation
which
currently
allows
agency
workers
to
be
employed
on
cheaper
rates
than
permanent
counterparts
by
some
companies
