huawei in british spotlight over use of u.s. firm's software
francisco
reuters
huawei
technologies
is
facing
increased
scrutiny
in
britain
because
it
is
using
an
aging
software
component
sold
by
a
firm
based
in
the
united
states
one
of
the
countries
where
lawmakers
allege
its
equipment
could
facilitate
chinese
spying
sources
told
reuters
the
fact
that
the
british
misgivings
stem
in
part
from
huawei
s
relationship
with
a
company
shows
how
trade
wars
and
heightened
national
security
concerns
are
making
it
harder
for
technology
firms
and
governments
to
safeguard
products
and
communication
networks
a
report
last
month
by
a
british
government
oversight
board
charged
with
analyzing
huawei
equipment
said
it
had
found
technical
and
supply
chain
shortcomings
which
exposed
the
country
s
telecoms
networks
to
new
security
risks
one
of
those
is
due
to
huawei
s
use
of
the
vxworks
operating
system
which
is
made
by
wind
river
systems
said
three
people
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
all
of
whom
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
when
discussing
details
which
were
not
made
public
in
the
report
the
sources
said
the
version
of
vxworks
being
used
by
huawei
will
stop
receiving
security
patches
and
updates
from
wind
river
in
even
though
some
of
the
products
it
is
embedded
in
will
still
be
in
service
potentially
leaving
british
telecoms
networks
vulnerable
to
attack
third
party
software
including
security
critical
components
on
various
component
boards
will
come
out
of
existing
support
in
even
though
the
huawei
end
of
life
date
for
the
products
containing
this
component
is
often
longer
the
july
report
which
did
not
name
vxworks
said
and
australian
lawmakers
have
said
huawei
s
products
can
be
used
to
facilitate
chinese
espionage
operations
an
allegation
the
world
s
biggest
producer
of
telecoms
equipment
has
repeatedly
denied
all
three
sources
said
there
was
no
indication
that
the
vxworks
mismatch
was
deliberate
there
is
also
no
suggestion
that
the
software
itself
represents
a
security
risk
reuters
was
not
able
to
establish
which
huawei
products
were
involved
or
what
steps
the
chinese
company
was
taking
to
address
the
issue
a
spokeswoman
for
wind
river
systems
said
she
was
unable
to
comment
on
huawei
but
said
the
company
often
helped
customers
upgrade
to
newer
software
versions
wind
river
offers
migration
routes
and
paths
for
its
customers
which
should
be
pretty
well
known
and
understood
in
the
industry
she
said
a
huawei
spokesman
declined
to
comment
on
specific
issues
in
the
report
but
said
the
company
would
address
any
areas
for
improvement
which
were
raised
by
british
authorities
cyber
security
remains
huawei
s
top
priority
and
we
will
continue
to
actively
improve
our
engineering
processes
and
risk
management
systems
he
said
while
the
united
states
and
australia
have
moved
to
restrict
the
use
of
its
gear
due
to
security
concerns
huawei
has
been
deepening
ties
with
britain
supplying
broadband
equipment
to
its
largest
telecoms
provider
bt
group
and
mobile
networks
for
wireless
giant
vodafone
group
consultant
edward
amoroso
a
former
chief
security
officer
at
at
t
said
huawei
s
experience
in
britain
showed
the
challenges
of
securing
international
supply
chains
although
no
one
should
dismiss
huawei
as
a
supplier
solely
because
of
its
geographical
location
reliance
on
software
that
is
going
out
of
support
is
a
legitimate
concern
amoroso
said
i
don
t
care
if
it
s
from
china
indiana
or
the
moon
it
speaks
badly
for
them
he
added
the
globalized
nature
of
the
technology
industry
has
come
under
increasing
scrutiny
as
countries
seek
to
limit
the
use
of
equipment
from
nations
they
regard
as
adversaries
in
the
united
states
the
pentagon
is
working
on
a
do
not
buy
list
to
block
vendors
who
use
software
code
originating
from
russia
and
china
and
moscow
has
had
problems
implementing
a
data
storage
law
without
relying
on
foreign
technology
by
contrast
london
says
it
effectively
addresses
any
security
issues
presented
by
the
use
of
huawei
products
as
part
of
britain
s
critical
national
infrastructure
by
having
the
equipment
reviewed
by
staff
at
a
special
company
laboratory
this
is
overseen
by
british
government
and
intelligence
officials
who
report
annually
on
its
work
in
addition
to
the
issue
with
vxworks
this
year
s
report
also
cited
technical
issues
which
limited
security
researchers
ability
to
check
internal
product
code
many
in
the
cybersecurity
industry
say
efforts
to
bar
equipment
or
software
on
grounds
of
nationality
are
futile
because
of
the
deeply
nature
of
the
global
technology
business
there
s
a
real
dilemma
for
policy
makers
for
politicians
said
robert
hannigan
former
director
of
britain

gchq
spy
agency
and
now
executive
chairman

europe
at

services

how
do
we
find
a
way
of
taking
advantage
of
foreign
technology
in
a
way
that
we
don
t
think
compromises
our
security
that
s
a
really
difficult
balance
