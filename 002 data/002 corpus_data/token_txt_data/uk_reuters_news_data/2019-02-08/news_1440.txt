barclays boss says uk finance sector will dodge brexit bullet
london
reuters
britain
s
banking
industry
will
emerge
largely
unscathed
from
brexit
and
retain
its
position
as
one
of
the
world
s
top
two
financial
centres
for
the
foreseeable
future
barclays
chairman
john
mcfarlane
told
reuters
home
to
the
world
s
highest
number
of
banks
and
largest
commercial
insurance
market
the
city
of
london
and
its
sister
district
in
east
london
s
canary
wharf
are
scrambling
to
prepare
for
britain
s
departure
from
the
european
union
the
biggest
challenge
the
uk
financial
sector
has
faced
since
the
financial
crisis
mcfarlane
shrugged
off
fears
expressed
by
some
bankers
and
politicians
that
a
blueprint
for
britain
s
future
trading
relationship
with
the
european
union
proposed
by
prime
minister
theresa
may
would
cripple
job
creation
and
trigger
london
s
rapid
decline
as
a
global
financial
services
centre
i
don
t
think
in
the
long
run
that
there
will
be
terminal
damage
to
london
mcfarlane
said
in
an
interview
in
his
capacity
as
chair
of
lobby
group
the
cityuk
brexit
will
cost
britain
up
to
financial
services
jobs
in
the
short
term
the
city
of
london
financial
district
s
leader
catherine
mcguinness
said
on
tuesday
and
many
more
jobs
might
disappear
in
the
longer
term
but
mcfarlane
said
london
would
remain
europe
s
primary
hub
for
financial
services
because
the
city
has
the
continent
s
deepest
markets
and
broadest
pool
of
talent
scotching
doomsayers
who
claim
the
sector
could
end
up
the
biggest
loser
from
the
end
of
unfettered
access
to
eu
markets
supporters
of
brexit
admit
there
may
be
some
pain
for
britain
s
trillion
economy
but
that
long
term
it
will
prosper
when
cut
free
from
the
eu
which
they
cast
as
a
failing
experiment
in
european
integration
a
sharp
spike
in
italy
s
cost
of
borrowing
in
late
may
also
handed
eu
stakeholders
a
sobering
reminder
that
the
eu
needs
london
s
markets
as
much
as
london
needs
the
eu
mcfarlane
said
italian
bond
yields
suffered
the
biggest
jump
since
on
may
after
a
fresh
phase
of
political
turmoil
forced
the
government
to
pay
the
highest
yield
in
more
than
five
years
at
an
auction
of
debt
and
when
prices
tumbled
traders
and
market
makers
with
relationships
with
the
world
s
biggest
investors
executed
the
largest
volume
of
italian
government
bond
trading
mcfarlane
pointed
out
the
only
reason
that
was
dealt
with
is
because
london
existed
given
that
we
have
a
competitive
advantage
in
those
areas
that
is
not
easily
replicated
that
is
a
fair
argument
for
why
people
need
to
use
this
system
going
forward
because
it
is
better
than
the
alternative
he
said
the
financial
sector
accounts
for
percent
of
britain
s
economic
output
but
mcfarlane
said
the
government
s
dismissal
of
the
sector
s
preferred
plans
for
access
to
the
eu
single
market
will
not
be
as
destructive
as
some
commentators
have
predicted
many
had
pinned
hopes
on
a
bid
for
mutual
recognition
whereby
britain
and
the
eu
would
accept
each
other
s
rules
in
exchange
for
broad
market
access
as
the
best
way
to
protect
financial
contracts
and
activity
worth
trillions
of
euros
once
britain
exits
the
eu
on
march
prime
minister
may
has
instead
chosen
to
build
trading
ties
on
a
legal
mechanism
known
as
equivalence
whereby
the
eu
deems
a
country
s
rules
to
be
as
robust
as
its
own
mcfarlane
said
the
government
now
needed
to
act
fast
to
negotiate
expanded
equivalence
for
britain
after
critics
said
the
regime
exposed
firms
to
sudden
loss
of
eu
market
access
you
need
to
get
on
with
it
aggressively
because
radical
change
in
this
space
is
difficult
he
said
the
eu
has
so
far
opposed
any
attempts
to
modify
equivalence
and
said
it
has
no
plans
to
reform
the
regime
mcfarlane
who
has
chaired
the
british
lender
and
thecityuk
since
said
he
was
confident
may
would
avert
a
potentially
chaotic
no
deal
scenario
despite
recent
ructions
in
westminster
that
have
put
further
strain
on
britain
s
relationship
with
eu
negotiators
i
am
always
optimistic
until
i
am
pessimistic
and
that
line
has
not
been
crossed
while
it
is
all
to
play
for
we
should
play
for
it
and
secure
it
economic
logic
must
win
through
somewhere
and
therefore
we
have
a
very
good
chance
of
securing
something
he
said
concerns
about
the
future
prosperity
of
britain
s
financial
services
sector
have
surged
since
some
of
its
biggest
employers
scrapped
wait
and
see
policies
on
relocation
and
began
executing
plans
to
shift
people
and
resources
from
the
uk
to
multiple
eu
outposts
barclays
has
announced
plans
to
shift
up
to
roles
to
the
continent
as
part
of
its
brexit
planning
mcfarlane
however
said
he
felt
reassured
that
may
and
her
cabinet
were
striving
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
private
sector
despite
statements
to
the
contrary
made
by
recalling
a
recent
dinner
attended
by
may
uk
finance
minister
philip
hammond
and
around
senior
banking
executives
from
all
over
europe
mcfarlane
said
both
politicians
impressed
with
their
grasp
of
the
biggest
problems
the
industry
faced
she
came
she
had
no
notes
but
she
was
fully
prepared
and
she
was
impressive
it
was
highly
symbolic
to
that
group
that
she
cared
he
said
i
don
t
think
the
official
part
of
government
is
dismissive
of
business
if
anything
they
are
