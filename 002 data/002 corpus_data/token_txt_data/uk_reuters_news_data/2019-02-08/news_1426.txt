bank of england poised to push rates above crisis lows
london
reuters
the
bank
of
england
looks
set
to
pass
a
crisis
milestone
next
week
by
finally
raising
interest
rates
above
their
emergency
levels
set
more
than
nine
years
ago
but
with
a
potentially
messy
brexit
nearing
governor
mark
carney
may
sound
cautious
about
the
pace
of
further
moves
away
from
the
boe
s
stimulus
programme
in
march
when
the
financial
crisis
was
raging
the
boe
slashed
its
benchmark
rate
to
percent
to
stave
off
the
risk
of
a
depression
bank
rate
has
sat
there
since
apart
from
a
period
after
the
shock
referendum
vote
in
for
britain
to
leave
the
european
union
when
it
was
cut
again
to
percent
the
lowest
in
the
history
of
the
central
bank
now
carney
and
his
colleagues
are
expected
to
nudge
rates
up
to
percent
on
going
beyond
last
november
s
increase
back
up
to
percent
however
taking
rates
above
their
crisis
levels
will
not
be
a
vote
of
confidence
in
the
world
s
economy
britain
has
gone
from
having
the
strongest
growth
of
the
group
of
seven
rich
nations
to
being
one
of
the
slowest
after
the
brexit
decision
the
terms
of
britain
s
future
relationship
with
the
eu
are
still
unclear
eight
months
before
brexit
and
prime
minister
theresa
may
could
yet
be
unseated
by
her
own
conservative
party
which
is
split
on
how
close
the
country
should
remain
to
the
bloc
at
the
same
time
consumers
are
still
feeling
a
squeeze
on
their
spending
power
and
inflation
while
above
the
boe
s
percent
target
at
percent
has
been
weaker
than
expected
nonetheless
the
boe
says
the
economy
can
not
grow
even
at
its
current
sluggish
rate
without
causing
too
much
inflation
given
britain
s
chronically
weak
productivity
growth
a
boe
decision
to
raise
borrowing
costs
could
also
be
backed
up
by
a
new
estimate
of
what
it
considers
the
neutral
interest
rate
for
britain
s
economy
which
neither
stimulates
nor
suppresses
demand
and
which
is
likely
to
be
rising
in
the
coming
years
as
the
effects
of
the
financial
crisis
fade
ahead
boe
officials
have
tried
to
soothe
concerns
about
raising
rates
something
they
promise
will
be
gradual
and
limited
voting
for
a
rate
rise
a
full
decade
after
monetary
policy
was
first
placed
on
an
emergency
setting
is
hardly
either
surprising
or
radical
chief
economist
andy
haldane
said
in
late
june
but
some
analysts
believe
raising
borrowing
costs
is
an
unnecessary
risk
that
the
central
bank
is
taking
because
it
failed
to
deliver
on
previous
signals
that
a
hike
was
coming
john
wraith
a
strategist
at
ubs
said
domestic
inflation
pressure
chiefly
from
wage
growth
was
very
benign
while
tighter
monetary
conditions
risked
triggering
a
squeeze
on
indebted
consumers
and
cooling
domestic
demand
if
and
when
that
happens
the
interest
rate
market
may
start
to
anticipate
a
reversion
by
the
boe
to
a
neutral
policy
stance
especially
if
there
are
ongoing
headwinds
and
downside
risks
to
the
outlook
emanating
from
the
uk
s
protracted
exit
from
the
eu
he
said
in
a
note
to
clients
adding
that
investors
might
even
start
to
bet
on
a
rate
cut
ahead
yet
the
chance
of
an
increase
on
thursday
is
rated
at
percent
by
financial
markets
and
eight
of
the
boe
s
nine
monetary
policymakers
are
likely
to
back
a
rise
analysts
say
investors
will
be
listening
closely
for
whatever
signals
carney
gives
about
the
outlook
for
further
increases
markets
are
not
pricing
in
an
increase
in
borrowing
costs
to
percent
for
at
least
another
year
in
the
past
carney
has
warned
investors
they
are
being
too
relaxed
about
the
prospect
of
further
hikes
victoria
clarke
an
economist
with
investec
said
the
boe
might
want
to
send
another
reminder
to
the
market
to
remain
on
guard
as
long
as
britain
manages
to
secure
a
deal
with
the
eu
and
avoid
a
damaging
brexit
we
don
t
know
what
politics
will
bring
but
i
think
carney
would
want
to
push
those
expectations
up
a
bit
