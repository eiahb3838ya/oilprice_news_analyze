london
reuters
foreign
secretary
jeremy
hunt
on
wednesday
set
out
plans
to
reinvigorate
and
expand
british
diplomacy
after
years
of
budget
cuts
as
the
country
looks
to
boost
its
influence
around
the
world
after
brexit
with
just
five
months
until
britain
leaves
the
european
union
its
biggest
foreign
policy
shift
in
more
than
years
hunt
said
britain
plans
to
hire
nearly
more
diplomatic
staff
open
new
embassies
and
boost
language
training
this
country
is
at
a
pivotal
historic
moment
the
global
balance
of
power
is
shifting
once
more
and
our
place
within
it
changes
as
well
hunt
said
in
a
speech
at
the
policy
exchange
think
tank
at
the
same
time
our
democratic
values
are
arguably
under
greater
threat
than
at
any
time
since
the
fall
of
the
berlin
wall
we
can
use
our
influence
our
reach
and
power
to
defend
our
values
by
becoming
an
invisible
chain
that
links
the
world
s
since
britain
voted
in
a
referendum
to
leave
the
eu
the
government
has
repeatedly
flagged
its
ambition
for
a
global
britain
but
mps
and
foreign
policy
experts
have
accused
it
of
lacking
a
strategy
or
resources
to
deliver
on
that
goal
hunt
said
britain
needed
to
redouble
its
efforts
to
defend
the
international
order
and
support
reform
of
international
institutions
including
the
united
nations
the
world
trade
organization
the
world
bank
and
the
commonwealth
the
foreign
office
has
faced
budget
cuts
under
successive
governments
which
have
seen
it
reduce
embassy
jobs
and
sell
off
exotic
properties
overseas
at
the
same
time
its
remit
has
shrunk
with
key
policy
areas
including
foreign
aid
trade
and
the
relationship
with
the
eu
moved
to
other
departments
the
foreign
office
s
operating
expenditure
fell
by
percent
between
and
and
was
then
frozen
in
real
terms
spending
watchdog
the
national
audit
office
said
last
year
there
is
a
mismatch
between
the
rhetoric
and
ambition
around
a
global
britain
and
actually
what
we
invest
in
the
diplomatic
service
itself
said
tom
raines
head
of
the
europe
programme
at
global
affairs
chatham
house
the
mismatch
he
added
was
quite
obvious
to
others
in
his
speech
entitled
britain
s
role
in
the
world
after
brexit
hunt
said
the
new
jobs
would
be
in
place
by
the
end
of
and
would
include
diplomatic
positions
overseas
in
london
and
new
local
staff
around
the
world
according
to
the
national
audit
office
the
foreign
office
employed
staff
globally
in
we
have
to
reinvigorate
and
expand
british
diplomacy
in
the
past
you
may
have
heard
of
retrenchment
and
retreat
not
anymore
hunt
said
adding
that
he
would
also
open
up
one
or
two
ambassador
posts
a
year
to
those
outside
the
civil
service
particularly
business
people
the
government
said
it
would
create
new
embassies
or
missions
many
of
them
in
commonwealth
countries
as
it
looks
to
revitalise
links
with
former
colonies
the
foreign
office
also
plans
to
boost
language
training
doubling
the
number
of
diplomats
who
speak
the
local
language
and
increasing
the
number
of
languages
taught
at
the
department
to
from
including
the
addition
of
kazakh
and
gujarati
there
is
a
perception
in
many
places
that
brexit
is
an
isolationist
or
backwards
step
for
the
uk
which
has
generally
been
seen
as
internationalist
and
open
so
there
is
a
big
job
for
the
uk
to
correct
that
narrative
