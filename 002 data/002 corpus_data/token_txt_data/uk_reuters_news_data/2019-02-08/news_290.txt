uk to spend over Â£100 million on ferries to cope with no-deal brexit
london
reuters
the
british
government
will
spend
more
than
million
pounds
chartering
extra
sea
ferries
to
ease
congestion
if
the
united
kingdom
fails
to
secure
a
trade
deal
before
leaving
the
european
union
next
year
just
three
months
before
the
united
kingdom
is
due
to
leave
the
world
s
largest
bloc
the
risk
of
a
brexit
is
rising
the
nightmare
scenario
for
many
businesses
which
are
now
planning
for
an
economic
shock
extra
ships
will
be
needed
to
work
new
routes
across
the
channel
in
the
event
that
the
main
french
terminal
of
calais
and
britain
s
dover
and
folkestone
are
clogged
up
by
customs
checks
currently
britain
s
membership
of
the
eu
means
that
trucks
drive
smoothly
through
border
checks
within
the
bloc
but
in
a
brexit
even
a
few
minutes
delay
at
customs
for
each
truck
would
be
likely
to
mean
vehicles
backing
up
at
ports
and
queuing
on
feeder
roads
on
both
sides
of
the
channel
to
ease
a
potential
backlog
the
government
has
awarded
three
contracts
to
provide
additional
freight
capacity
on
routes
from
english
ports
including
poole
portsmouth
and
plymouth
they
comprise
one
worth
million
pounds
with
the
french
firm
brittany
ferries
a
million
pound
deal
with
the
danish
shipping
company
dfds
and
a
million
pound
contract
with
seaborne
freight
the
leader
of
the
opposition
liberal
democrat
party
vince
cable
called
the
move
complete
madness
and
said
public
money
was
being
spent
recklessly
in
a
bid
to
prepare
for
a
outcome
the
contracts
were
not
put
out
to
tender
the
department
for
transport
said
it
was
responding
to
a
situation
of
extreme
urgency
brought
about
by
unforeseeable
events
about
trucks
pass
between
dover
and
calais
every
day
transporting
everything
from
perishable
food
to
medicines
and
the
industrial
goods
needed
to
keep
factories
running
this
extra
capacity
is
a
small
but
important
element
of
the
dft
s
planning
the
department
for
transport
said
in
a
statement
while
remaining
committed
to
working
to
ensure
a
deal
is
reached
the
department
is
helping
ensure
the
rest
of
government
are
fully
prepared
for
a
range
of
earlier
this
month
the
government
announced
that
all
government
departments
must
step
up
planning
for
a
brexit
including
putting
armed
forces
personnel
on
standby
to
deal
with
any
disruption
