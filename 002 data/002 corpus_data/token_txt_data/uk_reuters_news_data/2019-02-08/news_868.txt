i
m
not
stressed
at
all
eugenie
told
vogue
magazine
for
its
september
issue
it
s
very
because
you
want
it
to
be
perfect
but
then
you
realise
that
you
re
going
to
be
with
the
person
you
love
forever
and
nothing
else
really
while
the
royal
family
is
paying
for
the
wedding
itself
there
has
been
disquiet
among
republicans
and
some
newspapers
over
the
security
bill
for
the
event
which
has
been
estimated
at
more
than
million
pounds
million
given
that
eugenie
does
not
carry
out
official
royal
duties
about
people
signed
a
petition
organised
by
campaign
group
republic
against
taxpayers
money
being
spent
on
the
occasion
most
brits
opposed
taxpayer
funding
of
prince
harry
s
wedding
but
as
with
all
royal
events
were
forced
to
accept
it
a
spokesman
for
the
group
said
but
there
s
something
different
about
friday
s
royal
wedding
and
people
aren
t
britain
s
sun
newspaper
ran
a
front
page
story
on
wednesday
with
the
headline
too
much
for
eugenie
wedding
saying
the
event
could
have
been
held
at
a
chapel
near
her
childhood
home
