'a real offer' - raab suggests brexit proposal to eu may be final
london
reuters
britain
has
put
forward
a
real
offer
to
a
win
a
deal
on
leaving
the
european
union
by
october
brexit
secretary
dominic
raab
said
on
tuesday
suggesting
the
government
would
not
shift
much
from
its
agreed
negotiating
stance
with
just
under
three
months
before
britain
and
the
eu
want
to
agree
a
deal
to
end
over
years
of
union
prime
minister
theresa
may
is
struggling
to
sell
what
she
calls
her
brexit
to
her
own
party
and
across
a
divided
country
the
eu
has
tentatively
welcomed
what
has
become
known
as
the
chequers
plan
but
also
says
the
proposals
for
a
free
trade
areas
with
the
bloc
on
goods
raises
more
questions
than
answers
and
has
stepped
up
its
warnings
of
a
no
deal
outcome
but
may
s
two
negotiators
raab
and
europe
adviser
oliver
robbins
suggested
that
the
chequers
plan
was
britain
s
last
attempt
to
get
a
deal
that
will
usher
in
the
country
s
biggest
policy
shift
for
decades
this
is
as
we
have
engaged
in
that
dialogue
towards
the
end
date
of
october
a
real
offer
to
get
us
across
the
line
raab
told
a
parliamentary
committee
we
are
at
a
mature
stage
in
these
negotiations
this
isn
t
our
opening
pitch
what
i
would
say
is
this
is
a
far
advanced
well
principled
and
pragmatic
document
and
we
expect
to
negotiate
on
the
basis
of
but
asked
if
negotiators
had
received
any
informal
assurances
from
the
eu
that
the
chequers
plan
would
be
accepted
robbins
said
no
not
in
those
he
added
over
months
now
ministers
the
prime
minister
and
of
course
the
official
team
supporting
them
have
been
sounding
european
parliaments
out
on
all
of
the
eu
officials
have
voiced
concern
that
britain
is
still
trying
to
the
best
bits
of
their
union
suggesting
a
customs
arrangement
on
goods
but
ending
free
movement
of
people
one
of
the
bloc
s
four
basic
freedoms
may
had
to
fight
hard
to
secure
the
agreement
of
her
cabinet
of
ministers
at
her
chequers
country
residence
earlier
this
month
for
her
vision
for
britain
s
future
relationship
with
the
eu
but
as
soon
as
she
hailed
that
agreement
two
key
ministers
both
hardline
brexiteers
resigned
and
were
followed
out
of
the
door
by
junior
officials
in
protest
at
what
they
said
was
a
flawed
plan
that
in
keeping
close
economic
ties
with
the
eu
would
not
honour
the
result
of
the
brexit
referendum
some
mps
in
her
conservative
party
fear
that
she
will
be
forced
to
offer
up
more
in
the
negotiations
something
that
could
further
enrage
eurosceptics
who
fear
that
may
will
preside
over
a
brexit
in
name
only
and
the
bitterness
among
brexit
supporters
at
the
parliamentary
committee
was
clearly
targeted
at
robbins
with
some
suggesting
he
had
hijacked
the
talks
and
softened
may
s
position
a
statement
confirming
that
may
s
office
and
not
the
brexit
ministry
was
spearheading
the
negotiations
did
little
to
soothe
those
concerns
but
raab
was
upbeat
saying
he
believed
britain
would
get
a
good
deal
with
the
eu
though
that
it
would
be
a
challenge
to
get
an
agreement
on
the
future
trading
relationship
by
brexit
day
in
march
next
year
he
told
the
parliamentary
committee
i
think
that
would
be
a
challenge
but
one
that
i
am
up
