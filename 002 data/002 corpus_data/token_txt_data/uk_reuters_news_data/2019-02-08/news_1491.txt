reuters
lawyers
for
immigrant
families
separated
by
the
government
at
the
border
with
mexico
said
a
federal
judge
s
order
barring
rapid
deportations
until
at
least
next
tuesday
would
give
their
clients
breathing
room
as
they
decided
their
next
steps
the
families
had
been
separated
amid
a
broader
crackdown
on
illegal
immigration
by
president
donald
trump
s
administration
sparking
an
international
outcry
and
a
lawsuit
by
the
american
civil
liberties
union
aclu
trump
ordered
that
the
practice
be
halted
on
june
and
the
government
faces
a
july
deadline
to
reunite
families
but
with
more
than
children
and
their
parents
remaining
separate
lawyers
have
been
scrambling
to
stem
deportations
and
give
immigrant
families
a
greater
say
in
their
futures
in
monday
s
order
district
judge
dana
sabraw
in
san
diego
agreed
with
the
aclu
that
parents
facing
imminent
deportation
deserved
a
week
to
decide
whether
to
leave
their
children
in
the
united
states
to
pursue
asylum
separately
the
order
gave
lawyers
more
time
to
figure
out
what
reunification
is
going
to
mean
for
our
clients
said
beth
krause
a
supervising
lawyer

project
immigrant
families
won
a
separate
victory
on
monday
night
when
district

laura
taylor
swain
in
manhattan
temporarily
barred
the
government
from
moving
any
of
the
dozens
of
separated
children
represented
in
new
york
by
the
legal
aid
society
without
at
least
hours
notice
legal
aid
had
sought
an
emergency
injunction
saying
the
government
was
moving
children
and
parents
without
giving
them
time
to
meet
their
lawyers
and
discuss
possible
legal
consequences
including
removal
from
the
country
at
a
tuesday
afternoon
hearing
before
district
judge
jesse
furman
in
manhattan
government
lawyers
sought
to
overturn
swain
s
order
saying
the
case
could
impede
its
ability
to
comply
with
the
order
to
reunify
families
furman
declined
to
rule
immediately
saying
he
had
yet
to
read
the
underlying
paperwork
gregory
copeland
a
legal
aid
lawyer
told
the
judge
he
did
not
believe
any
children
had
been
moved
out
of
new
york
since
the
lawsuit
had
been
filed
swain
s
temporary
order
expires
on
july
unless
a
judge
extends
it

rights
project
said
sabraw
s
broader
ban
on
rapid
deportations
buys
us
a
little
bit
of
i
am
still
uncertain
we
have
made
contact
with
all
the
parents
who
are
detained
in
our
particular
region
he
said
baron
s
group
has
secured
legal
representation
for
several
dozen
separated
parents
sent
to
government
detention
centres
in
washington
state
but
even
on
monday
he
said
he
learned
of
an
immigrant
mother
who
had
yet
to
make
contact
with
a
lawyer
she
might
have
slipped
through
the
cracks
without
the
judge
s
order
baron
said
many
of
the
immigrants
are
fleeing
violence
