london
reuters
an
exit
deal
between
britain
and
the
european
union
is
within
sight
brexit
minister
dominic
raab
told
parliament
on
tuesday
as
lawmakers
from
all
sides
told
him
the
current
negotiating
plan
had
little
hope
of
winning
their
approval
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
eu
on
march
but
has
yet
to
secure
an
agreement
to
define
future
relations
with
brussels
and
manage
the
economic
impact
of
ending
over
four
decades
of
integration
with
the
world
s
largest
trading
bloc
brussels
has
dismissed
key
elements
of
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
brexit
strategy
formulated
in
july
at
her
chequers
country
retreat
and
it
has
been
widely
criticised
by
both
those
who
want
a
more
radical
break
from
the
eu
and
those
who
want
even
closer
ties
nevertheless
raab
was
upbeat
when
delivering
a
summary
of
progress
in
the
negotiations
to
parliament
on
its
first
day
back
after
the
summer
break
we
have
made
significant
progress
we
are
making
significant
progress
every
week
and
a
deal
is
within
our
sights
he
said
however
other
lawmakers
were
less
positive
indicating
that
may
s
minority
government
will
struggle
to
find
support
for
whatever
deal
it
strikes
with
brussels
may
must
win
parliamentary
approval
on
a
deal
or
risk
leaving
the
eu
without
any
formal
agreement
chequers
is
a
dead
as
a
dodo
the
secretary
of
state
raab
knows
that
and
so
does
everyone
else
in
this
house
said
tom
brake
a
lawmaker
from
the
liberal
democrat
party
raab
said
he
disagreed
describing
the
negotiations
as
positive
earlier
may
s
spokesman
said
britain
had
to
step
up
efforts
to
get
a
deal
describing
talks
as
at
a
crucial
and
intense
phase
nevertheless
with
an
october
deadline
for
a
deal
expected
to
slip
into
november
and
little
sign
of
breakthrough
on
fundamental
disagreements
with
the
eu
financial
markets
remain
nervous
about
the
possibility
of
britain
leaving
without
a
deal
a
senior
official
at
the
brexit
ministry
said
he
was
confident
that
plans
were
in
place
for
the
possibility
of
a
exit
raab
said
that
while
no
deal
was
not
what
the
government
wants
there
would
be
some
countervailing
opportunities
but
the
main
opposition
labour
party
s
brexit
policy
chief
keir
starmer
said
raab
had
failed
to
reassure
anyone
and
that
may
s
brexit
negotiating
strategy
would
not
survive
intact
