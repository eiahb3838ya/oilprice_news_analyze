highlights - eu leaders' comments at special brexit summit
brussels
reuters
the
eu
national
leaders
gathered
on
sunday
to
endorse
both
a
detailed
treaty
setting
out
the
terms
on
which
britain
will
leave
the
european
union
and
a
declaration
outlining
how
britain
can
keep
close
to
its
biggest
market
by
following
many
eu
rules
after
a
two
to
four
year
transition
the
following
are
their
comments
there
was
no
applause
no
flowers
and
everyone
said
it
was
an
unhappy
there
is
no
plan
b
this
is
the
deal
on
the
table
and
i
m
not
willing
to
contemplate
defeat
in
the
british
parliament
because
i
have
every
confidence
in
theresa
may
and
the
wisdom
of
the
british
i
can
only
tell
you
in
all
honesty
what
the
situation
is
and
the
situation
is
that
there
is
no
plan
b
this
is
the
deal
on
the
table
if
anyone
thinks
in
the
united
kingdom
that
by
voting
no
something
better
would
come
out
of
it
they
are
wrong
this
is
the
best
we
can
get
for
both
the
european
union
and
the
united
you
can
certainly
say
it
was
a
historic
summit
and
a
historic
day
which
produces
mixed
emotions
it
is
tragic
that
great
britain
leaves
the
eu
after
years
but
we
have
to
respect
the
vote
of
the
british
people
and
based
on
this
it
is
good
that
we
agreed
on
a
withdrawal
agreement
and
a
political
declaration
about
future
ties
with
great
what
if
deal
rejected
by
uk
parliament
this
is
a
speculative
question
that
i
can
not
answer
we
have
committed
to
something
in
a
very
difficult
situation
and
i
think
that
theresa
may
as
british
prime
minister
will
do
everything
she
can
to
play
her
part
and
so
we
are
concentrating
on
completing
the
course
we
have
set
ourselves
the
negotiations
to
date
have
been
difficult
and
for
the
current
and
future
ones
we
should
base
ourselves
on
the
motto
where
there
is
a
will
is
there
a
way
in
this
tragic
and
sad
situation
what
is
good
is
that
we
have
gone
down
a
difficult
path
with
this
withdrawal
agreement
and
that
should
give
us
assurance
and
strength
so
that
we
can
sort
out
the
future
relations
the
european
parliament
will
stress
its
role
referring
to
any
extension
of
the
transition
period
changes
can
not
be
made
without
the
due
involvement
of
the
european
said
the
parliament
vote
on
the
withdrawal
treaty
will
be
in
either
february
or
march
today
is
not
a
good
day
asked
what
would
happen
if
uk
parliament
rejects
deal
it
s
impossible
to
the
we
must
draw
all
the
consequences
that
show
that
the
european
union
has
a
fragile
side
it
can
be
improved
it
shows
that
our
europe
needs
to
be
rebuilt
and
that
is
the
option
i
support
and
will
continue
to
work
on
the
issue
of
fishing
of
reciprocal
access
our
fishermen
will
be
well
protected
that
is
a
priority
in
our
future
relationship
reinstated
in
the
text
and
very
present
in
today
s
it
s
not
a
day
when
we
should
celebrate
nor
a
day
of
mourning
it
is
the
choice
of
a
sovereign
people
european
commission
president
juncker
it
is
a
sad
day
seeing
a
country
like
great
britain
but
i
would
say
this
of
any
others
leaving
the
european
union
is
not
a
moment
of
jubilation
or
celebration
it
is
a
sad
moment
a
i
believe
that
the
british
government
will
succeed
in
securing
the
backing
of
the
british
i
would
vote
in
favour
of
this
deal
because
this
is
the
best
deal
possible
for
britain
this
is
the
deal
it
is
the
best
deal
possible
and
the
european
union
will
not
change
its
fundamental
position
when
it
comes
to
this
all
along
this
extraordinary
negotiation
very
difficult
we
have
worked
to
reach
a
deal
that
means
to
organise
in
an
orderly
fashion
the
withdrawal
decided
by
the
uk
we
have
negotiated
with
the
uk
never
against
the
uk
now
it
is
time
for
everybody
to
take
their
responsibility
everybody
this
deal
is
a
necessary
step
to
build
trust
between
the
uk
and
the
eu
we
need
build
in
the
next
phase
of
this
unprecedented
and
ambitious
partnership
we
will
remain
allies
partners
and
i
think
the
loss
of
the
united
kingdom
is
really
bad
news
i
have
always
thought
that
i
think
we
now
have
an
agreement
that
limits
the
damage
for
the
uk
and
for
the
eu
what
we
have
found
is
an
acceptable
package
but
it
remains
bad
news
but
a
balanced
package
for
both
this
is
a
balanced
outcome
with
no
political
winners
or
victories
but
i
think
it
is
acceptable
i
don
t
expect
a
no
vote
i
expect
a
yes
vote
and
this
is
the
deal
on
the
table
i
don
t
think
there
s
anything
i
don
t
want
to
contemplate
a
no
vote
i
think
there
will
be
a
yes
vote
but
more
in
general
i
think
this
is
the
maximum
we
can
all
do
both
theresa
may
and
her
government
as
well
as
the
european
union
no
victors
here
today
nobody
winning
we
re
all
losing
but
given
the
context
that
