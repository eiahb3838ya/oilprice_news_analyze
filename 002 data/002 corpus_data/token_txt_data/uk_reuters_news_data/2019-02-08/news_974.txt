paris

the
european
union
has
more
pressing
priorities
than
britain
s
future
relationship
with
the
bloc
starting
with
its
own
future
french
finance
minister
bruno
le
maire
said
eu
leaders
last
week
rejected
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
proposals
for
trade
standing
firm
on
their
position
that
the
plan
would
undermine
their
cherished
single
market
the
british
made
their
choice
that
s
fine
excuse
me
to
say
so
brutally
but
there
are
more
important
things
for
us
than
the
future
of
the
united
kingdom
it
s
the
future
of
the
european
union
le
maire
told
a
small
group
of
foreign
journalists
on
tuesday
any
decision
that
gives
european
citizens
the
impression
that
you
can
leave
the
european
union
and
keep
all
the
advantages
would
be
suicidal
he
added
he
said
the
priority
was
to
strengthen
the
euro
zone
notably
by
completing
plans
for
a
backstop
for
its
bank
resolution
fund
and
creating
a
shared
budget
so
that
it
could
cope
with
a
new
financial
or
economic
crisis
paris
is
reluctant
to
let
britain
s
eu
divorce
talks
drag
on
and
president
emmanuel
macron
said
last
week
that
he
expected
britain
to
put
forward
new
proposals
next
month
may
has
insisted
she
is
sticking
with
her
chequers
plan
despite
fierce
opposition
from
some
in
her
party
she
has
complained
that
the
eu
had
not
given
her
detailed
reasons
for
its
rebuff
macron
s
cabinet
is
holding
meetings
every
two
weeks
to
ensure
practical
preparations
are
in
place
should
britain
leave
the
eu
without
a
agreement
in
place
le
maire
said
far
more
was
at
stake
for
britain
as
all
estimates
indicated
brexit
would
have
only
a
limited
impact
on
french
economic
growth
