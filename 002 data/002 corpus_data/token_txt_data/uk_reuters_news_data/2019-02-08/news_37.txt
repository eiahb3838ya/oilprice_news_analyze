to

widespread
calls
to
resign
after
last
year
s
disputed
presidential

sources
briefed
on
the
matter
said
that
the
lima
group
looked
set
though
to
hold
off
imposing
further
sanctions
on
the
maduro
government
when
it
meets
in
ottawa
most
group
members
say
maduro
should
quit
in
favour
of
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
who
declared
himself
interim
president
last
month
and
are
calling
for
a
new
presidential
election
in
the
troubled
opec
nation
the
united
states
which
is
not
a
member
of
the
group
also
wants
maduro
gone
how
can
we
continue
to
support
the
opposition
to
keep
the
pressure
up
on
the
regime
and
push
for
new
elections
certainly
that
s
something
we
ll
be
looking
at
said
a
canadian
government
official
maduro
who
has
overseen
an
economic
collapse
and
the
exodus
of
millions
of
venezuelans
said
in
an
interview
that
aired
on
spanish
television
channel
antena
on
sunday
we
don
t
accept
ultimatums
from
anyone
adding
i
refuse
to
call
for
elections
now
there
will
be
elections
in
maduro
who
has
maintained
the
critical
support
of
the
military
has
said
guaido
is
staging
a
coup
against
him
monday
s
meeting
in
ottawa
will
also
discuss
how
to
aid
the
people
of
venezuela
including
through
immediate
humanitarian
assistance
said
the
office
of
canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
last
month
the
lima
group
announced
a
travel
ban
on
senior
venezuelan
officials
and
a
freeze
on
their
foreign
assets
the
canadian
source
who
requested
anonymity
given
the
sensitivity
of
the
situation
declined
to
comment
when
asked
whether
more
punitive
measures
could
be
imposed
two
sources
briefed
on
the
talks
said
such
an
announcement
was
unlikely
for
now
president
donald
trump
s
administration
last
week
issued
sanctions
on
venezuelan
oil
firm
pdvsa
in
a
move
likely
to
cut
revenues
for
a
country
hit
by
medicine
shortages
and
malnutrition
trump
in
an
interview
that
aired
on
sunday
said
military
intervention
in
venezuela
was
an
trudeau
spoke
on
sunday
to
guaido
and
the
two
discussed
the
importance
of
the
international
community
sending
a
clear
message
regarding
the
illegitimacy
of
the
maduro
regime
trudeau
s
office
said
the
challenge
for
participants
is
that
mexico
a
member
of
the
lima
group
opposes
any
measures
to
oust
maduro
who
also
has
the
backing
of
russia
china
and
turkey
while
european
union
governments
will
soon
move
to
recognise
guaido
as
interim
president
members
are
set
to
use
cautious
language
for
fear
of
setting
a
precedent
for
political
crises
said
diplomatic
sources
that
does
not
sit
well
with
nations
such
as
columbia
which
neighbours
venezuela
the
most
important
issue
now
is
to
get
europe
in
line
and
to
deepen
the
isolation
of
venezuela
and
its
backers

government
