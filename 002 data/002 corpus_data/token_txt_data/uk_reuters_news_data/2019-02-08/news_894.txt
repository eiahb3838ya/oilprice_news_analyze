threw
a
little
dance
move
before
a
speech
on

raising
a
laugh
in
brussels
as
he
appeared
to
mimic
theresa
may
but
angering
supporters
of
the
embattled
british

minister
and
her
brexit
plan
may
sashayed
on
stage
last

to
the
sound
of
abba
s
dancing
queen
a
gag
about
a
recent
trip
to
south
africa
where
she
had
danced
with
schoolchildren
may
then
used
the
stage
to
rally
her
divided
party
behind
her
efforts
to
negotiate
a
smooth
withdrawal
from
the
european
union
preparing
to
speak
at
a
conference
on
monday
juncker
was
unable
to
start
as
music
continued
to
play
in
the
hall
looking
up
from
his
notes
the
european
commission
president
whose
negotiators
are
locked
in
talks
with
may
s
officials
spread
his
arms
and
moved
his
shoulders
and
hips
in
time
with
the
rhythm
a
couple
of
seconds
was
enough
to
provoke
laughter
in
the
room
as
the
music
faded
juncker
gave
a
broad
grin
in
response
britons
were
quick
to
spot
how
close
his
gestures
were
to
may
s
before
her
keynote
speech
last
wednesday
at
the
annual
conference
of
her
conservative
party
the
daily
mail
said
he
appeared
to
mock
may
while
online

on
its
website
reflected
anger
over
the
eu

refusal
to
accept
the
may
government
s
terms
for
leaving
the
bloc
next
march
a
spokesman
for
juncker
a
former
premier
of
luxembourg
said
his
improvised
performance
was
not
directed
at
anyone
and
repeated
that
the
commission
president
has
great
respect
for
may
