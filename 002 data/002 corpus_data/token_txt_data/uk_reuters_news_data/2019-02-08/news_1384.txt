as
it
sought
to
quell
concerns
that
rival
deutsche
boerse
was
beginning
to
steal
significant
market
share
euro
clearing
has
become
a
brexit
battleground
as
some
eu
policymakers
want
it
moved
from
london
where

dominates
to
the

the
bloc
next
march
threatening
the
city
s
role
as
a
global
financial
centre
deutsche
bank
said
this
week
it
was
shifting
a
large
part
of
its
new
euro
derivatives
clearing
from
london
to
deutsche
boerse
in
frankfurt
we
have
seen
no
discernible
change
in
customer
behaviour

told

when
the

sharply
higher
lse
s
clearing
unit
lch
which
clears
about
percent
of
euro
denominated
contracts
globally
saw
a
percent
increase
in
customers
clearing
euro
swaps
in
the
first
half
warren
said
deutsche
boerse
was
simply
getting
a
small
slice
of
a
growing
pie
he
added
the
lse
reported
a
percent
rise
in
adjusted
operating
profit
to
million
pounds
as
its
clearing
capital

and
information
services

the
lse
said
it
was
activating
contingency
plans
in
case
britain
crashes
out
of
the
european
union
next
march
without
a
transition
deal
these
include
applying
for
an
eu
licence
in
amsterdam
for
its
turquoise
share
trading
platform
the
complexity
and
the
lack
of
clarity
of
the
application
of
a
hard
brexit
may
decrease
the
effectiveness
or
applicability
of
some
of
these
contingency
plans
the
bourse
operator
said
in
a
statement
a
hard
brexit
could
adversely
affect
its
business
results
of
operations
financial
condition
and
cash
flows
it
said
the
exchange
also
has
a
clearing
subsidiary
in
paris

warren
said
it
was
not
applying
for
an
extension
of
its
licence
there
to
clear
interest
rate
swaps
the
contracts
that
deutsche
boerse
is
attracting
from
deutsche
bank
warren
said
lch
in
london
will
apply
instead
to
the
eu
for
recognition
to
continue
serving
customers
in
the
eu
from
london
after
brexit
customers
don
t
want
clearing
to
be
split
between
different
clearing
houses
which
would
bump
up
costs
warren
said
it
s
never
going
to
be
about
one
currency
one
product
