hugely
outpacing
inflation
won
t
be

even
if
britain
and
the
eu
strike
a
brexit
deal
the
vast
majority
of
economists
and
analysts
polled
by

said
property
values
in
the
capital
long
a
haven
for
foreign
investors
more
than
tripled
in
the
last
years
but
demand
and
turnover
have
crumbled
since
the
june
vote
to

the
european
union
and

were
raised
according
to
the
nov

from

according
to

website
rightmove
sterling
the
stock
market
and
businesses
have
had
a
turbulent
few
years
since
britons
narrowly
voted
to
end
their
membership
of
the
eu
with
just
over
four
months
left
until
brexit

prime
minister
theresa
may
faces
opposition
from
lawmakers
in
all
parties
to
her
negotiated

fuelling
fears
the
country
may
leave
without

that
risk
appeared
to
grow
on
shares
in
housebuilders

fell
between
and
percent
in
their
worst
daily
performance
since
the
referendum
things
are
starting
to
look
a
bit
bleak
uncertainty
is
about
the
only
thing
we
can
be
certain
about
over
the
next
two
years
said
independent
buying
agent
henry
pryor
asked
if
there
would
be
a
return
to
strong
turnover
and
house
price
growth
in
london
and
the
south
east
if
a
brexit
deal
was
struck
of
respondents
said
no
two
said
it
would
happen
regardless
and
one
said
it
depended
on
the
deal
but
brexit
is
not
the
only
factor
holding
back
prices
a
sharp
increase
in
stamp
duty
land
tax
paid
when
buying
a
house
has
particularly
affected
the
capital
where
houses
are
much
more
expensive
than
the
rest
of
the
country
the
high
rates
of
sdlt
will
continue
to
stifle
transaction
volumes
especially
in
expensive
price
areas
like
london
and
the
south
east

boulger
a
senior

at

modest
dip
london

market
by
the
median
forecast
was
only
percent
significantly
down
from
the

given
in

that
may
be
partly
explained
by
the
view
that
prices
are
already
falling
but
not
everyone
was
gloomy
about
the

prospects
london

history
tells
us
that
you

therefore
it
s
clear
that

again
in
the

those
moderate

below
expectations
for

increases
and
will
likely
cheer
buyers
who
are
struggling
to
get
on
the
property
ladder
when
asked
to
rate
the
level
of
london
house
prices
on
a
scale
of
to
where
one
is
extremely
cheap

the
median
response
was
nationally
they
were
rated
where
it
has
been
for
a
couple
of
years
while
borrowing
costs
are
currently
low
the
bank
of
england
is
forecast
to
raise
rates
again
after
brexit
but
the
new
level
of
bank
rate
will
still
be
historically
low
at
percent
and
it
is
not
expected
to
rise
to
percent
