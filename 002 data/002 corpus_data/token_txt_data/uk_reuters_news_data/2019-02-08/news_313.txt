reuters
turkey
will
take
over
the
fight
against
islamic
state
militants
in
syria
as
the
united
states
withdraws
its
troops
president
tayyip
erdogan
said
on
friday
in
the
latest
upheaval
wrought
by
washington
s
abrupt
policy
shift
the
surprise
announcement
by
president
donald
trump
this
week
that
he
would
withdraw
roughly
troops
has
felled
a
pillar
of
american
policy
in
the
middle
east
critics
say
trump
s
decision
will
make
it
harder
to
find
a
diplomatic
solution
to
syria
s
conflict
for
turkey
the
step
removes
a
source
of
friction
with
the
united
states
erdogan
has
long
castigated
his
nato
ally
over
its
support
for
syrian
kurdish
ypg
fighters
against
islamic
state
turkey
considers
the
ypg
a
terrorist
group
and
an
offshoot
of
the
armed
kurdistan
workers
party
pkk
fighting
for
kurdish
autonomy
across
the
border
on
turkish
soil
in
a
speech
in
istanbul
erdogan
said
turkey
would
mobilise
to
fight
remaining
islamic
state
forces
in
syria
and
temporarily
delay
plans
to
attack
kurdish
fighters
in
the
northeast
of
syria
shifts
both
precipitated
by
the
american
decision
to
withdraw
the
news
was
less
welcome
for
other
allies
both
france
and
germany
warned
that
the
change
of
course
risked
damaging
the
campaign
against
islamic
state
the
jihadists
who
seized
big
swathes
of
iraq
and
syria
in
but
have
now
been
beaten
back
to
a
sliver
of
syrian
territory
likewise
the
militia
spearheaded
by
the
ypg
said
a
turkish
attack
would
force
it
to
divert
fighters
from
the
battle
against
islamic
state
to
protect
its
territory
a
official
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
said
american
troops
may
continue
to
operate
against
islamic
state
in
syria
the
pentagon
is
considering
using
special
operation
teams
based
in
iraq
to
target
militants
in
syria
the
official
said
the
official
emphasized
that
using
special
operators
on
the
ground
was
one
of
many
options
being
considered
was
still
in
the
planning
stages
and
that
no
final
decision
had
been
made
islamic
state
launched
an
attack
on
friday
in
syria
s
southeast
against
the
sdf
militia
employing
car
bombs
and
dozens
of
militants
we
will
be
working
on
our
operational
plans
to
eliminate
isis
islamic
state
elements
which
are
said
to
remain
intact
in
syria
in
line
with
our
conversation
with
president
trump
erdogan
said
the
turkish
president
had
announced
plans
last
week
to
start
an
operation
east
of
the
euphrates
river
in
northern
syria
to
oust
the
ypg
from
the
area
that
it
largely
controls
this
week
he
said
the
campaign
could
come
at
any
moment
but
on
friday
he
cited
the
talk
with
trump
as
a
reason
to
wait
our
phone
call
with
president
trump
along
with
contacts
between
our
diplomats
and
security
officials
and
statements
by
the
united
states
have
led
us
to
wait
a
little
longer
he
said
we
have
postponed
our
military
operation
against
the
east
of
the
euphrates
river
until
we
see
on
the
ground
the
result
of
america
s
decision
to
withdraw
from
erdogan
said
however
that
this
was
not
an
waiting
period
and
that
due
to
past
negative
experiences
ankara
welcomed
the
united
states
statements
with
an
equal
amount
of
pleasure
and
caution
turkey
has
repeatedly
voiced
frustration
over
what
it
says
is
the
slow
implementation
of
a
deal
with
washington
to
pull
ypg
fighters
out
of
manbij
a
town
in
mainly
arab
territory
west
of
the
euphrates
in
northern
syria
the
united
states
will
probably
end
its
air
campaign
against
is
in
syria
when
it
pulls
out
troops
officials
have
said
erdogan
s
foreign
minister
said
the
withdrawal
plan
would
be
discussed
by
the
two
countries
in
washington
in
january
trump
maintained
that
is
had
been
wiped
out
a
view
not
shared
by
key
allies
that
washington
had
been
doing
the
work
of
other
countries
and
it
was
time
for
others
to
finally
fight
his
defence
secretary
jim
mattis
opposed
the
decision
and
abruptly
announced
on
thursday
he
was
resigning
after
meeting
with
the
president
in
a
candid
letter
to
trump
the
retired
marine
general
emphasised
the
importance
of
showing
respect
to
allies
that
have
voiced
surprise
and
concern
about
the
president
s
decision
russia
said
on
friday
it
did
not
understand
what
the
united
states
next
steps
in
syria
would
be
adding
that
chaotic
and
unpredictable
in
washington
was
creating
discomfort
in
international
affairs
several
of
trump
s
fellow
republicans
in
congress
joined
by
opposition
democrats
urged
the
president
to
reverse
course
saying
the
withdrawal
would
strengthen
the
hand
of
russia
and
iran
in
syria
and
enable
a
resurgence
of
islamic
state
trump
has
given
no
sign
of
changing
his
mind
he
promised
to
remove
forces
from
syria
during
his
election
campaign
the
roughly
troops
in
syria
many
of
them
special
forces
were
ostensibly
helping
to
combat
islamic
state
but
were
also
seen
as
a
possible
bulwark
against
syrian
president
bashar
who
has
retaken
much
of
the
country
from
his
foes
in
the
civil
war
with
military
help
from
iran
and
russia
is
declared
a
caliphate

parts
of
syria
and
iraq
the
sunni

established
their
de
facto
capital
in
the
syrian
city
of
raqqa
using
it
as
a
base
to
plot
attacks
in
europe
a
senior
official
last
week
said
islamic
state
was
down
to
the
last
percent
of
the
territory
it
once
held
the
group

no
remaining

an

may
not
be
