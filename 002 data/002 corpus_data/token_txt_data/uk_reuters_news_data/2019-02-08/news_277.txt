ralph
snake
walked
across
washington
s
national
mall
on
wednesday
he
stopped
every
few
feet
to
pick
up
litter
that
has
accumulated
in
the
expanse
of
grass
since
a
budget
showdown
partially
closed
the
federal
government
days
ago
i
decided
to
clean
up
this
one
section
because
that
s
what
americans
will
do
said
snake
a
member
of
the
indigenous
nation
in
wisconsin
snake
came
to
the
capital
to
witness
sharice
davids
get
sworn
in
as
one
of
the
first
two
women
of
native
american
descent
to
become
members
of
congress
the
partial
shutdown
which
has
cut
off
many
government
services
entered
its
day
on
wednesday
with
no
end
in
sight
it
stems
from
an
impasse
between
congressional
democrats
who
control
the
house
of
representatives
as
of
thursday
and
president
donald
trump
who
is
demanding
billion
billion
pounds
in
funding
for
a
wall
on
the
border
with
mexico
national
parks
have
closed
campgrounds
out
of
fear
that
toilets
will
overflow
with
human
waste
hundreds
of
thousands
of
federal
employees
are
working
without
pay
the
immigration
court
system
already
suffocating
under
a
backlog
is
largely
shuttered
the
prospects
for
an
end
to
the
showdown
remained
unclear
even
as
congressional
leaders
visited
the
white
house
on
wednesday
in
washington
the
museums
run
by
the
smithsonian
as
well
as
the
national
zoo
closed
their
doors
on
wednesday
after
running
out
of
emergency
funding
leaving
tourists
frustrated
with
politicians
of
both
parties
it
s
stupid
said
laura
vanbragt
a
student
from
grand
rapids
michigan
there
should
just
be
more
communication
between
the
two
more
give
on
both
outside
the
bureau
of
engraving
and
printing
clint
woods
and
his
family
stood
waiting
for
a
guided
tour
with
other
visitors
who
were
locked
out
of
more
popular
venues
it
s
like
two
squabbling
children
woods
said
of
trump
and
democratic
leaders
in
congress
they
both
think
they
re
right
and
they
re
dug
at
joshua
tree
national
park
which
is
named
after
the
spiked
yucca
plants
that
grow
all
over
the
park
s
desert
landscape
roads
and
scenic
turnouts
were
full
of
cars
on
wednesday
but
campgrounds
were
closed
rock
climbers
kiera
waskey
and
stefan
nelson
were
able
to
camp
in
the
park
for
three
nights
after
arriving
on
a
visit
from
minnesota
we
were
told
that
today
we
had
to
clean
up
camp
and
we
can
t
camp
here
anymore
which
was
a
bummer
waskey
said
standing
near
rock
outcroppings
dotted
by
several
climbers
i
guess
we
take
it
for
granted
almost
these
beautiful
places
that
we
have
and
we
never
thought
we
d
have
to
prepare
for
it
the
shutdown
he
said
public
bathrooms
and
trash
bins
at
the
park
were
well
kept
because
volunteers
were
cleaning
them
visitors
said
the
booth
at
the
park
s
entrance
was
closed
so
visitors
were
able
to
roll
in
without
paying
an
entrance
fee
frequent
park
visitors
marie
hoffman
and
trevor
goodman
who
are
both
and
students
at
university
of
california
davis
said
they
noticed
a
lot
more
climbers
and
general
visitor
than
they
normally
see
at
the
park
it
looks
like
disneyland
today
with
just
all
the
cars
and
everything
so
many
visitors
hoffman
said
attributing
the
increased
traffic
to
the
temporary
lack
of
an
entrance
fee
unlike
in
some
previous
government
shutdowns
many
national
parks
have
remained
open
though
without
staff
to
collect
trash
and
service
restrooms
advocates
have
voiced
alarm
that
an
extended
shutdown
could
cause
environmental
damage
we
re
very
concerned
about
the
reports
we
re
seeing
of
human
waste
in
inappropriate
places
said
john
garder
senior
director
of
budget
and
appropriations
for
the
national
parks
conservation
association
trash
is
a
serious
concern
for
the
impact
of
the
shutdown
has
reached
the
nation
s
immigration
courts
as
well
hundreds
of
judges
are
on
furlough
and
only
cases
of
immigrants
in
detention
are
being
heard
the
trump
administration
has
expanded
the
system
which
is
run
by
the
department
of
justice
aiming
to
cut
down
on
the
backlog
of
more
than
cases
but
the
shutdown
will
complicate
that
effort
said
ashley
tabaddor
the
president
of
the
national
immigration
judges
union
to
reschedule
these
cases
can
take
several
years
because
the
judges
are
all
booked
she
said
a
justice
department
spokesman
said
he
could
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
because
of
the
shutdown
meanwhile
some
government
workers
are
either
furloughed
or
working
without
pay
until
the
shutdown
ends

the
local
chapter
of
a
union
that
represents
government

she
is
avoiding
using
her
credit
cards
and
putting
off
some
expenses

that
