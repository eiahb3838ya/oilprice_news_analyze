north korea media says denuclearisation includes ending 'u.s. nuclear threat'
seoul
reuters
any
deal
for
north
korea
to
give
up
its
nuclear
arsenal
must
include
completely
removing
the
nuclear
threats
of
the
north
korean
state
media
said
on
thursday
in
one
of
the
clearest
explanations
of
how
north
korea
sees
denuclearisation
president
donald
trump
and
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
issued
a
statement
after
a
historic
meeting
in
singapore
in
june
reaffirming
the
north
s
commitment
to
work
towards
complete
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
and
including
guarantees
of
security
to
north
korea
conflicting
or
vague
views
of
what
exactly
denuclearisation
means
however
have
complicated
negotiations
that
now
appear
stalled
when
we
refer
to
the
korean
peninsula
they
include
both
the
area
of
the
dprk
and
the
area
of
south
korea
where
aggression
troops
including
the
nuclear
weapons
of
the
are
deployed
the
north
s
kcna
news
agency
said
in
a
commentary
using
the
initials
of
north
korea
s
official
name
the
democratic
people
s
republic
of
korea
when
we
refer
to
the
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
it
therefore
means
removing
all
elements
of
nuclear
threats
from
the
areas
of
both
the
north
and
the
south
of
korea
and
also
from
surrounding
areas
from
where
the
korean
peninsula
is
the
united
states
deployed
nuclear
weapons
in
south
korea
from
to
since
they
were
withdrawn
the
united
states
has
extended
its
nuclear
umbrella
of
support
to
japan
and
south
korea
using
bombers
and
submarines
based
elsewhere
north
korea
rejects
american
calls
for
it
to
unilaterally
denuclearize
and
washington
should
give
up
its
ambition
to
force
pyongyang
to
abandon
its
nuclear
weapons
by
practices
and
pressure
the
news
agency
said
the
united
states
needs
to
understand
the
phrase
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
before
it
is
too
late
it
said
a
spokesman
for
south
korean
president
moon
who
has
said
kim
intends
to
achieve
complete
denuclearisation
declined
to
comment
on
the
north
korean
call
to
lift
the
nuclear
protection
from
south
korea
saying
there
was
no
need
to
respond
to
every
kcna
comment
truth
the
united
states
has
said
that
it
will
not
lift
sanctions
on
north
korea
until
more
progress
has
been
made
toward
its
verifiable
denuclearisation
the
united
states
has
also
rejected
any
suggestion
that
it
would
reduce
its
military
presence
in
the
region
as
part
of
a
deal
with
north
korea
but
in
a
surprise
step
after
the
june
summit
trump
announced
that
the
pentagon
would
cancel
most
of
its
largest
military
exercises
conducted
with
the
south
koreans
the
exact
definition
of
denuclearisation
is
likely
to
be
raised
again
as
trump
has
said
he
is
working
to
meet
again
with
kim
sometime
early
next
year
it
is
a
truth
that
the
denuclearization
of
the
korean
peninsula
is
a
joint
work
which
can
never
come
true
unless
the
dprk
and
the
make
joint
efforts
kcna
said
in
the
commentary
arguing
that
threats
had
forced
north
korea
to
develop
a
nuclear
deterrent
it
would
be
proper
to
say
that
the
denuclearization
of
the
korean
peninsula
means
completely
removing
the
nuclear
threats
of
the
to
the
dprk
before
it
means
the
elimination
of
its
nuclear
at
a
press
briefing
in
washington
on
tuesday
state
department
spokesman
robert
palladino
said
he
would
not
split
words
when
asked
about
whether
the
promise
of
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
means
only
north
korea
or
the
broader
region
we
are
focused
on
the
denuclearisation
of
north
korea
palladino
said
we
remain
confident
and
we
look
forward
to
the
commitments
that
chairman
kim
and
that
president
trump
have
