ireland ready for resumption of 'professional' brexit talks
dublin
reuters
ireland
expects
brexit
negotiators
to
return
to
the
kind
of
professional
talks
that
had
been
going
on
before
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
party
conference
and
do
what
is
needed
to
reach
a
deal
foreign
minister
simon
coveney
said
on
tuesday
with
six
months
to
go
before
britain
leaves
the
eu
may
s
precarious
position
at
the
helm
of
her
party
has
been
tested
this
week
by
a
conference
that
further
highlighted
the
deep
divisions
within
her
party
over
how
she
intends
to
see
britain
leave
the
eu
coveney
said
that
had
resulted
in
a
lot
of
very
forceful
language
on
both
sides
of
the
brexit
debate
within
britain
s
ruling
conservative
party
but
that
much
of
that
was
for
domestic
and
internal
political
party
consumption
the
european
union
which
is
deadlocked
in
negotiations
with
britain
over
how
to
avoid
the
return
of
a
hard
border
between
ireland
and
northern
ireland
should
instead
be
calm
and
sensible
and
not
get
dragged
into
that
debate
he
said
as
soon
as
this
conference
is
over
i
hope
we
will
get
back
to
the
kind
of
professional
negotiations
that
had
been
going
on
before
the
tory
party
conference
to
get
what
needs
to
be
done
in
the
next
couple
of
months
over
the
line
coveney
told
reporters
that
will
be
our
focus
and
not
taking
the
bait
from
comments
that
are
somewhat
inflammatory
i
think
we
would
be
foolish
to
get
drawn
into
distractions
what
s
needed
now
is
to
ensure
that
the
commitments
that
have
been
made
by
the
british
government
are
actually
going
to
be
followed
