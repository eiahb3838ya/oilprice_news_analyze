sweden's centre-left in slim lead as uncertain election nears - poll
stockholm
reuters
the
swedish
bloc
holds
a
slim
lead
over
the
ahead
of
sunday
s
national
election
a
survey
showed
but
both
are
short
of
a
majority
and
the
sweden
democrats
could
yet
emerge
as
the
largest
single
party
the
ruling
social
democrats
and
greens
and
their
parliament
ally
the
left
party
were
backed
by
percent
according
to
friday
s
poll
by
novus
for
public
service
broadcaster
svt
the
other
of
the
two
blocs
that
have
defined
swedish
politics
for
a
decade
the
alliance
coalition
trailed
close
behind
on
percent
the
nationalist
sweden
democrats
scored
percent
well
above
the
percent
they
won
in
the
previous
election
in
those
figures
suggest
political
gridlock
may
be
hard
to
avoid
after
sunday
s
vote
i
think
we
are
facing
an
extremely
complicated
process
to
form
a
government
maybe
the
most
complicated
in
modern
times
said
political
scientist
niklas
bohlin
at
the
mid
sweden
university
either
some
form
of
cooperation
between
the
and
alliance
or
an
accommodation
with
the
sweden
democrats
is
likely
to
be
necessary
but
the
two
blocs
have
never
governed
in
tandem
and
so
far
all
other
parties
have
shunned
the
sweden
democrats
while
most
pollsters
see
the
two
blocs
winning
roughly
equal
support
the
figures
for
the
sweden
democrats
differ
widely
between
surveys
ranging
at
about
percent
in
the
traditional
polls
based
on
phone
calls
the
nationalists
score
as
high
as
percent
in
some
online
surveys
which
have
often
been
seen
as
at
greater
risk
of
being
skewed
but
the
traditional
polls
greatly
underestimated
support
for
the
sweden
democrats
before
the
previous
election
while
the
online
surveys
were
far
closer
to
the
result
it
s
not
that
they
are
shy
voters
but
that
they
are
distrustful
of
the
polling
agencies
said
henrik
ekengren
oscarsson
a
professor
in
political
science
at
gothenburg
university
so
the
sweden
democrats
sympathisers
are
not
participating
in
these
kinds
of
traditional
pollsters
have
said
they
have
altered
their
methods
to
better
reflect
the
level
of
support
for
the
sweden
democrats
