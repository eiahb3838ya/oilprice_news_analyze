amid problems, macron names new environment minister in reshuffle
paris
reuters
french
president
emmanuel
macron
appointed
a
former
green
lawmaker
as
his
new
environment
minister
on
tuesday
hoping
to
inject
new
life
into
his
rattled
administration
after
a
summer
of
problems
and
before
another
round
of
reforms
macron
was
forced
into
the
move
after
nicolas
hulot
a
popular
resigned
live
on
radio
last
week
over
what
he
felt
were
hollow
commitments
on
environmental
policy
the
nomination
of
francois
de
rugy
to
replace
him
reflected
macron
s
desire
to
give
the
sensitive
portfolio
which
includes
energy
to
a
career
politician
with
experience
balancing
ideals
with
political
realities
energy
analysts
said
the
president
also
named
roxana
maracineanu
as
sports
minister
to
replace
former
olympic
fencing
champion
laura
flessel
who
said
she
was
quitting
for
personal
reasons
maracineanu
is
an
olympic
swimming
silver
medalist
hulot
s
resignation
was
a
blow
for
macron
who
is
still
reeling
from
a
bodyguard
scandal
in
july
just
as
he
prepares
to
embark
on
reforms
to
cut
public
sector
jobs
tame
the
budget
deficit
and
streamline
the
pension
system
for
much
of
macron
s
first
year
in
power
the
former
investment
banker
appeared
untouchable
and
unphased
by
his
falling
popularity
as
he
pushed
through
reforms
with
efficiency
recently
however
macron
has
looked
more
vulnerable
economic
growth
is
slower
than
forecast
undermining
his
credentials
unemployment
is
no
longer
coming
down
usually
decisive
macron
is
wavering
on
an
impending
tax
collection
reform
meanwhile
voters
are
growing
impatient
with
his
monarchical
style
and
sharp
tongue
it
wasn
t
supposed
to
happen
to
this
president
he
promised
to
be
audacious
in
his
reforms
efficient
in
the
exercise
of
power
and
the
embodiment
of
dignity
in
his
first
few
months
the
promise
was
kept
but
now
everything
is
going
wrong
the
le
figaro
said
in
an
editorial
on
monday
even
so
macron
s
minimalist
reshuffle
with
just
two
changes
points
to
a
president
determined
to
pursue
his
reforms
and
not
be
seen
to
react
to
the
latest
poll
numbers
analysts
said
he
has
sold
his
overhaul
on
promises
that
it
will
boost
growth
and
jobs
but
voters
spanning
typically
conservative
pensioners
to
workers
complain
his
policies
mostly
favour
big
business
and
the
wealthy
next
up
for
his
centrist
government
is
tackling
social
spending
a
delicate
balancing
act
as
he
seeks
to
restore
credibility
with
the
left
just
as
growth
puts
pressure
on
the
budget
deficit
macron
s
election
victory
which
blew
apart
france
s
mainstream
parties
and
halted
the
march
of
the
national
front
party
delighted
french
business
and
urban
liberal
voters
but
prone
to
haughty
and
at
times
condescending
remarks
he
has
struggled
to
connect
with
common
folk
an
survey
on
tuesday
showed
just
percent
of
respondents
were
happy
with
his
performance
with
support
eroding
across
all
ages
on
both
the
political
left
and
right
the
headline
number
was
down
percentage
points
that
is
lower
than
his
predecessor
francois
hollande
was
at
the
same
stage
in
the
socialist
s
presidency
hollande
went
on
to
become
so
unpopular
he
was
the
first
president
in
france
s
fifth
republic
not
to
run
for
it
s
something
of
a
year
zero
for
emmanuel
macron
the
slate
is
being
wiped
clean
even
his
popularity
is
starting
at
zero
again
everything
has
to
be
rebuilt
said
philippe
moreau
chevrolet
of
the
sciences
po
political
school
in
paris
in
a
rare
moment
of
humility
macron
on
monday
acknowledged
the
challenges
to
a
class
of
young
school
students
there
are
some
days
which
are
easy
and
others
which
