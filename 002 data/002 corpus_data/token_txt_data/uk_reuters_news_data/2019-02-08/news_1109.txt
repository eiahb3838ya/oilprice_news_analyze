told

governor
has
been
appointed
as
the
coordinator
for
the
bridge
disaster
relief
giving
him
a
powerful
voice
in
the
reconstruction
initiative
italy
s
ruling
coalition
which
comprises
the
league
and
movement
has
accused
autostrade
of
serious
oversights
in
its
maintenance
of
the
bridge
and
said
it
wants
to
revoke
its
motorway
concessions
transport
minister
danilo
toninelli
who
is
a
member
of
has
said
autostrade
must
pay
for
the
rebuilding
work
but
should
not
be
involved
in
any
other
way
but
toti
appeared
to
reject
that
line
fincantieri
will
have
the
leadership
of
the
reconstruction
together
with
a
group
of
companies
that
will
also
include
autostrade
he
said
toti
said
he
had
asked
the
government
to
issue
a
decree
to
waive
european
union
tender
rules
for
public
works
to
the
reconstruction
a
consortium
including
fincantieri
and
autostrade
would
be
the
quickest
way
to
rebuild
the
viaduct
a
key
piece
of
infrastructure
for
both
genoa
and
the
country
he
said
the
port
of
genoa
generates
percent
of
italy
s
gross
domestic
product
we
have
to
focus
to
give
the
bridge
back
to
genoa
and
its
citizens
said
toti
who
is
a
member
of
the
conservative
opposition
group

go
italy
toninelli
took
to
twitter
to
criticise
toti
s
drive
to
put
together
a
consortium
saying
he
was
using
the
disaster
to
win
political
consensus
but
toti
dismissed
the
attack
a
ministry
that
was
not
able
to
supervise
infrastructure
as
it
should
have
can
not
block
local
authorities
who
are
working
efficiently
on
behalf
of
their
citizens
