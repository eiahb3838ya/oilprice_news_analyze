on
board
the
aquarius
reuters
rescue
ship
aquarius
which
has
picked
up
almost
migrants
from
the
mediterranean
this
year
will
carry
out
rescue
missions
without
waiting
for
orders
from
coastguards
and
will
not
return
people
to
libya
its
search
and
rescue
head
said
when
we
see
there
is
a
vessel
in
distress
with
a
high
likelihood
of
people
dying
we
will
go
and
rescue
them
immediately
as
per
international
maritime
law
nick
romaniuk
told
reuters
on
board
the
aquarius
over
the
last
year
coordination
centres
asking
rescue
vessels
to
go
on
standby
or
wait
for
clarification
on
certain
things
had
added
to
the
danger
of
people
needing
to
be
rescued
which
is
why
they
would
no
longer
wait
he
added
the
vessel
operated
by
charity
sos
mediterranee
set
sail
from
marseille
this
week
on
its
tenth
mission
of
the
year
the
ship
will
be
patrolling
between
miles
from
the
libyan
coast
west
of
tripoli
an
area
that
is
outside
libya
s
territorial
waters
but
inside
the
libyan
search
and
rescue
region
international
law
states
the
country
responsible
for
operations
in
an
area
has
primary
responsibility
for
disembarking
rescue
ships
romaniuk
said
that
while
aquarius
would
continue
to
abide
by
international
maritime
law
it
would
not
be
taking
people
back
to
libya
because
it
was
not
a
safe
place
putting
it
at
odds
with
the
wishes
of
the
new
italian
government
libya
is
still
not
recognised
as
a
port
of
safety
so
we
will
not
be
taking
people
back
there
because
a
rescue
can
not
terminate
in
a
place
which
is
not
deemed
a
port
of
safety
he
said
it
has
to
continue
for
the
time
being
to
be
european
ports
but
again
it
s
not
our
decision
to
make
maritime
authorities
they
make
that
decision
but
our
red
line
will
be
not
taking
people
back
to
libya
he
said
in
the
past
the
aquarius
has
waited
for
orders
from
the
responsible
authorities
before
moving
ahead
to
rescue
migrants
aiming
to
reach
italy
from
libya
but
italy
has
toughened
its
stance
since
the
new
government
a
coalition
including
the
league
party
took
office
earlier
this
year
interior
minister
matteo
salvini
leader
of
the
league
has
spearheaded
a
policy
to
shut
ports
to
charity
ships
that
pick
up
migrants
from
overcrowded
smugglers
boats
he
now
wants
as
many
as
possible
to
be
picked
up
by
libyan
coastguards
and
returned
in
june
the
aquarius
picked
up
migrants
off
the
coast
of
libya
planning
to
take
them
to
the
nearest
european
port
the
usual
practice
with
such
rescue
missions
but
the
italian
government
asked
the
ship
to
go
to
malta
rather
than
italy
triggering
a
standoff
that
drew
in
the
european
union
and
france
salvini
has
accused
sos
mediterranee
and
other
charities
of
acting
like
a
mediterranean
taxi
service
for
the
migrants
the
aquarius
is
one
of
a
number
of
ships
that
have
carried
out
rescue
operations
in
the
southern
mediterranean
alongside
the
italian
navy
and
missions
a
rescue
boat
operated
by
the
spanish
charity
proactiva
open
arms
this
week
rescued
migrants
in
the
southern
mediterranean
in
international
waters
more
than
migrants
have
drowned
in
the
region
since
