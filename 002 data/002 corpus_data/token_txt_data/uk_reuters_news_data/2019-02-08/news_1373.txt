less
than
a
third
of
uk
business
leaders
surveyed
have
carried
out
contingency
planning
on
brexit
the
institute
of
directors
iod
said
on
friday
percent
were
not
intending
to
do
any
planning
and
of
those
percent
thought
brexit
would
not
affect
them
while
percent
were
waiting
until
the
relationship
between
britain
and
the
eu
becomes
clearer
firms
that
trade
with
both
eu
and
countries
were
more
active
in
contingency
planning
the
survey
showed
many
companies
are
still
unprepared
for
brexit
and
it
s
hard
to
blame
them
said
stephen
martin
iod
director
general
when
it
comes
to
knowing
what
to
plan
for
and
when
firms
have
been
left
in
the
dark
he
added
in
a
statement
as
long
as
remains
a
possibility
it
is
essential
that
the
government
steps
up
to
the
plate
and
provides
advice
on
preparing
for
such
an
outcome
we
therefore
urge
them
to
speed
up
publication
of
the
technical
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
government
has
said
it
will
set
out
the
notices
on
preparations
in
august
and
september
