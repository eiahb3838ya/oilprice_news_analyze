london
reuters
one
of
britain
s
biggest
pension
funds
has
joined
other
investors
law
firms
and
trade
bodies
in
raising
concerns
about
plans
to
give
the
government
more
power
to
scrutinize
takeovers
and
other
deals
on
security
grounds
documents
seen

which

stakes
in
heathrow

and
the

thames
water
has
said
it
is
worried
that
politics
could
influence
the
way
future
governments
use
the
proposed
powers
britain
announced
a
sweeping
plan
in
july
to
give
the
government
more
scope
to
examine
deals
and
investments
on
the
basis
of
national
security
in
the
biggest
overhaul
of
the
rules
since
the
enterprise
act
in
the
plan
would
allow
the
uk
to
investigate
a
wide
range
of
transactions
from
company
takeovers
and
loans
to
sales
of
assets
such
as
land
and
intellectual
property
putting
key
decisions
in
the
hands
of
a
senior
minister
the
government
has
said
it
is
mainly
seeking
to
safeguard
infrastructure
and
technology
assets
with
the
new
rules
reuters
has
reviewed
responses
submitting
during
a
consultation
by
the
government
respondents
included
the
uss
which
has
billion
pounds
billion
in
assets
we
are
concerned
that
the
interpretation
and
implementation
of
this
regime
could
evolve
with
the
political
mood
of
the
nation
and
corresponding
change
of
government
and
therefore
lead
to
uncertainty
the
uss
said
although
it
recognised
the
government
s
need
to
scrutinize
infrastructure
deals
the
british
venture
capital
association
said
in
its
submission
that
it
was
concerned
that
the
power
might
be
used
for
political
other
respondents
to
the
consultation
which
closed
last
month
said
they
were
worried
the
plan
could
deter
foreign
investment
in
britain
the
government
which
has
yet
to
respond
to
the
consultation
has
not
said
how
many
submissions
it
received
these
reforms
are
aimed
solely
at
ensuring
the
government
s
ability
to
protect
national
security
a
government
spokesman
said
we
remain
open
for
business
and
welcome
foreign
britain
s
move
mirrors
initiatives
in
other
nations
to
prevent
sensitive
assets
falling
under
the
control
of
foreign
powers
such
as
china
such
steps
have
been
taken
by
germany
italy
and
the
united
states
but
respondents
to
the
consultation
said
britain
s
proposals
were
too
broad
they
also
said
the
government
had
underestimated
how
many
firms
would
flag
up
deals
for
security
screening
britain
has
only
formally
intervened
in
deals
on
the
grounds
of
national
security
in
nine
instances
since
according
to
fingleton
associates
a
firm
set
up
by
john
fingleton
who
ran
britain
s
office
of
fair
trading
under
the
new
rules
the
government
estimates
it
would
screen
about
cases
a
year
of
which
it
expects
to
face
deeper
examination
and
to
be
blocked
or
face
restrictions
law
firm
herbert
smith
freehills
said
in
its
consultation
submission
it
expected
the
number
of
reviews
and
interventions
to
be
dramatically
higher
given
the
numerous
acquisitions
with
assets
or
business
in
the
uk
and
also
given
the
regime
s
reach
on
for
example
