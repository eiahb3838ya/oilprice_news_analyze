eu's top court urged to rule brexit can be reversed
luxembourg
reuters
britain
can
unilaterally
reverse
its
decision
to
leave
the
european
union
an
urgent
hearing
of
europe
s
top
court
was
told
on
tuesday
in
a
case
supporters
of
eu
membership
hope
could
pave
the
way
to
a
second
referendum
and
ultimately
stop
brexit
lawyers
for
a
group
of
scottish
politicians
want
the
european
court
of
justice
ecj
to
interpret
whether
britain
can
revoke
its
notice
to
withdraw
from
the
eu
under
article
of
the
lisbon
treaty
without
agreement
of
the
other
states
britain
is
due
to
exit
the
eu
on
march
two
years
after
london
served
notice
in
line
with
a
june
vote
to
leave
but
the
fate
of
brexit
remains
up
in
the
air
with
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
draft
divorce
deal
agreed
with
the
eu
on
sunday
facing
a
difficult
vote
in
parliament
on
may
has
said
that
if
her
deal
is
voted
down
britain
could
leave
without
a
deal
or
there
could
be
no
brexit
at
all
some
opponents
of
brexit
want
a
second
referendum
giving
british
voters
the
option
to
remain
in
the
eu
may
s
government
says
a
second
referendum
will
not
happen
and
any
ruling
that
would
allow
the
reversal
of
britain
s
withdrawal
notice
would
be
irrelevant
since
it
is
against
government
policy
aidan
o
neill
lawyer
for
the
scottish
politicians
told
the
ecj
a
ruling
was
necessary
so
that
lawmakers
could
make
informed
decisions
these
petitioners
need
to
know
the
options
for
revocation
which
are
open
to
withdrawing
member
states
now
to
allow
them
properly
and
in
a
fully
informed
way
to
carry
out
their
duties
as
democratically
elected
representatives
if
britain
could
not
unilaterally
reverse
brexit
then
it
could
be
forced
out
against
its
wishes
he
said
it
is
fundamental
to
the
treaties
and
to
the
values
of
the
european
union
that
a
member
state
can
choose
to
revoke
its
withdrawal
from
the
union
without
the
need
for
the
unanimous
agreement
of
all
the
other
member
states
he
said
the
case
was
referred
to
the
luxembourg
justices
for
a
ruling
by
scotland
s
top
court
it
was
expedited
for
tuesday
s
hearing
before
a
full
court
of
judges
article
of
the
eu
treaty
which
sets
the
rules
for
leaving
the
bloc
states
that
if
a
country
decides
to
withdraw
it
has
two
years
to
agree
an
exit
deal
a
deadline
which
can
be
extended
only
if
the
remaining
eu
states
unanimously
agree
there
is
no
mention
of
whether
a
state
can
change
its
mind
no
other
member
state
has
ever
left
the
bloc
richard
keen
the
lawyer
for
the
british
government
said
the
ecj
should
refuse
to
consider
the
issue
at
all
saying
it
was
hypothetical
as
the
uk
had
no
intention
of
reversing
brexit
as
you
know
the
uk
does
not
intend
to
revoke
its
notification
said
keen
he
said
the
campaigners
behind
the
case
wanted
a
ruling
from
the
court
for
political
ammunition
to
put
pressure
on
the
british
parliament
likening
it
to
opening
pandora
s
box
we
respectfully
plead
that
the
court
should
not
open
this
box
keen
said
lawyers
for
the
eu
told
the
judges
revocation
would
require
the
unanimous
agreement
of
the
other
eu
states
otherwise
said
hubert
legal
representing
the
eu
s
executive
commission
it
could
allow
states
to
notify
their
intent
to
leave
and
then
seek
better
terms
from
the
remaining
eu
countries
to
charm
the
notifying
sheep
back
to
the
flock
