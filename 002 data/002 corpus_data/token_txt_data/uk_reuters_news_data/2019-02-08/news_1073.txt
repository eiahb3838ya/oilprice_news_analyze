simulated

interceptions
over
western
europe
on
wednesday
as
part
of
nato
drills
to
deter
russian
planes
from
entering
allied
airspace
and
to
showcase
european
efforts
to
integrate
their
air
defences
fighter
pilots
carrying
missiles
from
nato
nations
took
turns
to
simulate
the
interception
of
a
belgian
air
force
transport
plane
en
route
to
spain
performing
visual
inspections
of
the
aircraft
s
status
by
hovering
off
the
wings
at
speeds
of
mph
some
nato
jets
mainly
from
european
allies
are
on
alert
to
defend
alliance
airspace
as
nato
deals
with
a
dramatic
increase
in
russian
air
activity
on
its
borders
since
moscow
s
annexation
of
crimea
in
with
a
record
interceptions
across
nato
airspace
in
this
month
moscow
is
holding
its
largest
war
games
since
the
fall
of
the
soviet
union
with
some
aircraft
nato
is
relevant
this
is
not
theoretical
said
spanish
air
force
lieutenant
general
ruben
garcia
servert
on
board
the
belgian
military
transport
plane
as
italian
eurofighters
flew
close
to
the
cockpit
to
simulate
interceptions
they
later
included
british
typhoons
and
french
mirages
we
have
not
always
been
successful
in
showing
the
taxpayer
that
we
have
the
means
and
the
capabilities
to
protect
the
population
he
told
reuters
during
a
rare
public
display
of
flight
interceptions
european
allies
hope
such
displays
highlight
how
their
air
forces
are
defending
europe
in
the
face
of
sharp
criticism
from
president
donald
trump
who
at
a
summit
in
july
railed
against
europeans
for
not
spending
enough
on
defence
and
ports
able
to
divert
force
to
land
or
potentially
even
shoot
down
combat
aircraft
nato
says
its
air
policing
is
not
directed
at
russia
but
showdowns
between
rival
warplanes
in
the
baltic
and
black
sea
are
intensifying
two
jets
escorted
two
russian
bombers
over
the
arctic
ocean
on
in
the
latest
incident
while
russia
has
scrambled
fighter
jets
to
intercept
bombers
in
interceptions
that
have
echoes
of
the
cold
war
analysts
warn
that
any
collisions
in
the
air
over
the
mediterranean
baltic
or
black
sea
could
risk
the
start
of
a
wider
conflict
with
russia
both
sides
accuse
the
other
of
dangerous
pilot
behaviour
but
nato
says
russian
warplanes
regularly
fly
without
respecting
international
safety
norms
such
as
responding
to
air
traffic
control
and
requests
to
identify
themselves
russia
says
all
its
flights
are
conducted
in
accordance
with
international
law
we
have
seen
aircraft
coming
to
our
borders
without
flight
plans
without
any
kind
of
controls
safety
regulations
entering
into
our
area
garcia
severt
said
we
have
seen
frequent
activities
in
the
black
sea
but
not
only
sometimes
we
have
seen
aircraft
flying
around
europe
he
said
referring
to
russian
bombers
off
portugal
s
coast
nato
will
hold
its
biggest
exercise
since
in
october
and
november
in
norway
called
trident
juncture
and
involving
finland
and
sweden
with
more
than
troops
while
tensions
with
russia
have
already
prompted
nato
to
deploy
multinational
land
battalions
in
poland
and
the
baltics
nato
is
also
pushing
to
integrate
its
air
forces
despite
political
resistance
over
issues
of
sovereignty
under
an
agreement
being
negotiated
individual
nato
countries
air
forces
would
defend
each
other
s
airspaces
regardless
of
the
country
they
are
in
under
a
single
sky
concept
that
could
see
portuguese
planes
defending
spanish
airspace
for
example
today
each
nation
defends
its
own
airspace
unless
as
in
the
case
of
the
baltics
it
does
not
have
fighter
planes
