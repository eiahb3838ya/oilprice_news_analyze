ba apologises after 380,000 customers hit in cyber attack
london
reuters
british
airways
apologised
on
friday
after
the
credit
card
details
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
its
customers
were
stolen
over
a
period
in
the
most
serious
attack
on
its
website
and
app
the
airline
discovered
on
wednesday
that
bookings
made
between
and
had
been
infiltrated
in
a
very
sophisticated
malicious
criminal
attack
ba
chairman
and
chief
executive
alex
cruz
said
it
immediately
contacted
customers
when
the
extent
of
the
breach
became
clear
around
card
payments
were
compromised
the
airline
said
with
hackers
obtaining
names
street
and
email
addresses
credit
card
numbers
expiry
dates
and
security
codes
sufficient
information
to
steal
from
accounts
the
attack
came
months
after
the
carrier
suffered
a
massive
computer
system
failure
at
london
s
heathrow
airport
which
stranded
customers
over
a
holiday
weekend
shares
in
ba
s
parent
international
airlines
group
were
down
percent
in
afternoon
trading
on
friday
cruz
said
the
carrier
was
deeply
sorry
for
the
disruption
caused
by
the
attack
which
was
unprecedented
in
the
more
than
years
that
ba
had
operated
online
he
said
the
attackers
had
not
broken
the
airline
s
encryption
but
did
not
explain
exactly
how
they
had
obtained
the
customer
information
there
were
other
methods
very
sophisticated
efforts
by
criminals
in
obtaining
the
data
he
told
bbc
radio
it
security
company
avast
said
that
based
on
the
limited
information
available
the
attackers
had
probably
targeted
a
gateway
between
the
airline
and
a
payment
processor
because
no
travel
details
had
been
stolen
quite
often
when
it
s
just
a
hack
of
a
database
somewhere
it
is
hard
to
identify
when
something
has
been
compromised
avast
s
consumer
security
expert
pete
turner
said
this
feels
much
more
like
a
attack
where
data
is
moving
about
within
the
britain
s
government
said
authorities
including
the
national
cyber
security
centre
and
the
national
crime
agency
part
of
the
country
s
police
were
piecing
together
what
happened
specialist
officers
from
the
nca
s
national
cyber
crime
unit
are
managing
the
ongoing
investigation
and
are
on
site
working
with
ba
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
incident
the
nca
said
the
country
s
information
commissioner
s
office
said
it
had
been
alerted
by
ba
and
it
was
making
enquiries
under
new
gdpr
data
regulations
companies
must
inform
regulators
of
a
cyber
attack
within
hours
ba
advised
customers
to
contact
their
bank
or
credit
card
provider
and
follow
their
recommended
advice
it
also
took
out
ads
in
national
newspapers
on
friday
cruz
said
anyone
who
lost
out
financially
would
be
compensated
by
the
airline
data
security
expert
trevor
reschke
said
that
like
any
website
which
sees
large
volumes
of
card
transactions
ba
was
a
ripe
target
for
hackers
it
is
now
a
race
between
british
airways
and
the
criminal
underground
said
reschke
head
of
threat
intelligence
at
trusted
knight
one
will
be
figuring
out
which
cards
have
been
compromised
and
alerting
victims
whilst
the
other
will
be
trying
to
abuse
them
while
they
are
still
natwest
one
of
britain
s
biggest
card
issuers
said
it
was
receiving
call
volumes
because
of
the
breach
it
said
in
a
recorded
message
that
its
security
systems
would
likely
stop
any
fraud
as
a
result
of
the
hack
but
anyone
affected
should
look
out
for
unusual
activity
on
their
accounts
american
express
said
clients
did
not
need
to
take
any
action
and
the
company
would
alert
anyone
with
unusual
activity
on
their
cards
iag
said
the
data
breach
had
been
resolved
and
the
website
was
working
normally
and
that
no
travel
or
passport
details
were
stolen
after
the
computer
system
failure
in
may
ba
said
it
would
take
steps
to
ensure
such
an
incident
never
happened
again
but
in
july
it
was
forced
to
cancel
and
delay
flights
out
of
the
same
airport
due
to
problems
