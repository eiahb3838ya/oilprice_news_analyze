ireland
s
foreign
minister
insisted
there
was
no
credible
fallback
option
to
take
the
place
of
the
backstop
to
prevent
the
return
of
border
checks
on
the
island
of
ireland
after
brexit

are
all
committed
to
ensuring
that
the
backstop
never
takes
effect
and
should
it
ever
take
effect
we
are
committed
to
trying
to
ensure
that
it
is
only
temporary
and
can
be
replaced
with
something
more
permanent

thursday
but

the

in
my

is
not
another
credible
fallback
solution
that
can
take
the
place
of
the
backstop
and
that
is
why
eu
leaders
have
been
so
clear
and
why
the
british
prime
minister
has
been
so
clear
that
there
is
a
need
for
the
backstop
even
though
we
want
to
avoid
