tony blair sees 50-50 chance of another brexit referendum
london
reuters
former
british
leader
tony
blair
said
there
was
a
chance
of
another
brexit
referendum
as
prime
minister
theresa
may
will
be
unlikely
to
secure
a
parliamentary
majority
for
any
divorce
deal
less
than
six
months
before
britain
leaves
the
european
union
there
is
little
clarity
about
how
trade
between
the
eu
and
the
world
s
fifth
largest
economy
will
function
if
may
can
strike
a
deal
with
the
eu
her
minority
government
then
has
to
get
it
approved
by
a
parliament
whatever
brexit
is
on
offer
today
is
going
to
result
in
significant
economic
harm
blair
former
head
of
the
opposition
labour
party
and
prime
minister
from
to
told
reuters
i
think
the
odds
are
now
percent
that
you
will
get
another
referendum
i
still
believe
it
is
possible
that
brexit
is
stopped
he
said
there
is
no
majority
in
parliament
for
any
proposition
that
the
prime
minister
brings
both
opponents
and
supporters
of
brexit
agree
that
the
divorce
is
britain
s
most
significant
political
and
economic
move
since
world
war
two
though
they
cast
vastly
different
futures
for
the
trillion
uk
economy
and
the
world
s
biggest
trading
bloc
leaving
the
european
union
was
once
less
than
two
decades
ago
british
leaders
such
as
blair
were
arguing
about
when
to
join
the
euro
and
talk
of
an
eu
exit
was
the
reserve
of
fringe
politicians
but
the
euro
zone
crisis
fears
in
britain
about
immigration
and
miscalculations
by
former
prime
minister
david
cameron
prompted
britons
to
vote
to
percent
for
brexit
in
a
june
referendum
a
new
vote
blair
said
could
ask
whether
voters
wanted
to
exit
without
a
deal
or
stay
in
a
reformed
eu
and
offer
new
membership
terms
he
said
eu
leaders
would
be
willing
to
reform
the
bloc
blair
has
repeatedly
called
for
reversing
brexit
echoing
other
critics
including
french
president
emmanuel
macron
who
have
suggested
britain
could
still
change
its
mind
recent
opinion
polls
indicate
a
slight
move
towards
support
for
staying
in
the
eu
but
may
has
repeatedly
said
there
will
be
no
new
referendum
blair
said
that
if
brexit
did
happen
economic
dislocation
would
force
britain
to
deregulate
further
to
attract
foreign
investors
brexiteers
anticipate
some
economic
pain
but
say
britain
will
then
thrive
if
cut
loose
from
what
they
see
as
a
doomed
experiment
in
unity
and
excessive
welfare
spending
blair
said
that
if
the
uk
exited
the
eu
and
then
socialist
labour
party
leader
jeremy
corbyn
won
power
the
country
would
face
a
truly
damaging
and
challenging
situation
this
is
the
problem
with
the
policies
of
both
major
parties
they
seem
to
think
you
can
do
brexit
and
then
engage
in
a
whole
lot
of
social
legislation
to
make
capitalism
fairer
and
more
equal
and
so
on
blair
said
they
have
got
to
wake
up
to
the
fact
that
if
you
do
brexit
your
priority
is
going
to
be
keeping
this
place
as
an
attractive
place
for
investors
to
he
said
european
regulators
would
not
want
the
centre
of
european
finance
currently
london
to
be
outside
their
orbit
why
give
ourselves
this
problem
in
a
field
of
the
global
economy
where
we
are
globally
preeminent
blair
said
adding
that
the
government
had
cast
aside
the
interests
of
the
service
sector
