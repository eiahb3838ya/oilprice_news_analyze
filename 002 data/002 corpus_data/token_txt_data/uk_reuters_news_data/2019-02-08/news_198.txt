ireland readies 'mega' no-deal brexit legislation package
dublin
reuters
ireland
will
begin
pushing
through
a
mega
package
of
legislation
next
month
to
deal
with
the
fallout
from
a
brexit
if
there
is
still
a
prospect
of
britain
leaving
the
european
union
without
a
divorce
deal
in
march
ireland
s
cabinet
on
tuesday
began
to
build
upon
the
contingency
plans
it
issued
last
month
by
seeking
to
reassure
business
of
the
availability
of
additional
transport
capacity
and
patients
of
the
security
of
medicine
supplies
its
preparations
will
be
underpinned
by
one
single
emergency
brexit
bill
incorporating
new
laws
that
deputy
prime
minister
simon
coveney
will
if
required
begin
moving
through
parliament
in
the
final
week
of
february
we
don
t
want
to
have
to
do
this
of
course
nobody
wants
a
brexit
and
everybody
will
work
towards
avoiding
that
but
we
also
have
to
ensure
that
ireland
has
done
everything
it
can
to
protect
itself
and
its
citizens
coveney
told
a
news
conference
to
allow
officials
to
make
preparations
the
government
will
prioritise
just
six
new
proposed
laws
in
other
areas
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
compared
to
the
pieces
of
legislation
given
priority
during
the
same
period
last
year
as
part
of
tuesday
s
plans
the
transport
ministry
said
sufficient
capacity
will
be
available
for
direct
sailings
from
ireland
to
continental
eu
ports
as
a
potential
alternative
for
the
large
amount
of
goods
transited
through
the
uk
should
demand
for
further
capacity
arise
the
shipping
sector
can
respond
quickly
to
meet
it
it
added
however
the
department
also
said
the
scale
of
checks
required
in
a
brexit
would
likely
result
in
delays
for
goods
moving
through
irish
ports
requiring
measures
to
prevent
congestion
the
plans
again
did
not
touch
on
the
central
issue
for
ireland
in
the
event
of
a
brexit
how
it
can
defend
the
single
market
without
imposing
physical
infrastructure
on
its
border
with
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
transport
minister
shane
ross
told
the
news
conference
he
anticipated
that
there
would
be
checks
but
was
interrupted
by
coveney
who
said
the
best
way
to
deal
with
the
border
issue
was
through
the
draft
agreement
struck
by
brexit
negotiators
there
are
a
number
of
areas
where
we
haven
t
published
contingency
plans
not
least
because
people
are
voting
this
evening
on
how
to
deal
with
this
issue
coveney
said
speaking
before
british
lawmakers
resoundingly
defeated
the
deal
if
britain
leaves
without
a
deal
well
then
we
obviously
have
to
have
difficult
discussions
with
the
european
commission
and
the
uk
in
terms
of
how
we
protect
the
eu
single
market
but
we
have
deliberately
not
got
into
that
detail
because
we
have
a
way
of
dealing
