british

higher
taxes
need
not
hurt
the
economy
but
may
s
fragile
hold
on
power
as
she
attempts
to
navigate
brexit
made
significant
increases
unlikely
in
the

statement
instead
efforts
to
lighten
britain
s
debt
burden
were
the
likeliest
casualty
of

promise
to
end
austerity
potentially
leaving

vulnerable

the

crisis
hits

said
it
s
going
to
be
very
hard

not

its

concerns
at
a
point
where
you
don

parliamentary
majority
the
public

don
t
tend
to
be
looked
after
in
such
a
conservative
way
as
they
might
otherwise
johnson
said
weak
economic
growth
made

reduction
much
slower
than
the

they
took

said
he
aims
to
run
a
balanced
budget
by
the
at
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
the
budget
deficit
last
year
was
the
lowest
since
the
financial
year
but
public

more

even
a
narrow
interpretation
of
no
more

for

but
a
continued
welfare
squeeze
would
leave
a
hole
in
hammond
s
budget
plans
filling

rises
would
need

as
a

doing
that
would

that
we
haven
t
had

a
sustained
period
since
