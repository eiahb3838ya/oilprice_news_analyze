turkey
could
end
its
crisis
with
the
united
states
instantly
by
freeing
a
detained
american
pastor
president
donald
trump
s
national
security
adviser
said
adding
that
a
qatari
cash
infusion
would
not
help
ankara
s
economy
the
turkish
currency
has
been
in
freefall
since
washington
ordered
tariffs
in
retaliation
for
the
detention
of
pastor
andrew
brunson
on
charges
of
complicity
in
a
failed
coup
brunson
denies
wrongdoing
and
ankara
has
in
the
past
suggested
his
fate
could
be
linked
to
that
of
a
turkish
cleric
whom
president
tayyip
erdogan
accuses
of
orchestrating
the
attempted
putsch
look
the
turkish
government
made
a
big
mistake
in
not
releasing
pastor
brunson
bolton
told
reuters
in
an
interview
during
a
visit
to
israel
every
day
that
goes
by
that
mistake
continues
this
crisis
could
be
over
instantly
if
they
did
the
right
thing
as
a
nato
ally
part
of
the
west
and
release
pastor
brunson
without
asked
if
the
united
states
questioned
turkey
s
membership
in
nato
given
the
bolton
said
that
s
not
an
issue
at
the
moment
we
re
focussed
on
pastor
brunson
and
the
other
americans
that
the
turkish
government
s
holding
illegitimately
and
we
expect
that
to
get
qatar
s
emir
this
month
approved
a
package
of
economic
projects
including
a
billion
pledge
of
support
for
turkey
giving
a
boost
to
a
lira
that
has
lost
some
percent
of
its
value
this
year
bolton
was
sceptical
about
the
intervention
by
the
gulf
state
which
has
been
feuding
with
allies
in
the
middle
east
such
as
saudi
arabia
united
arab
emirates
and
egypt
well
i
think
what
they
pledged
is
utterly
insufficient
to
have
an
impact
on
turkey
s
economy
it
s
certainly
not
helpful
but
we
ll
actually
see
what
develops
from
their
pledge
