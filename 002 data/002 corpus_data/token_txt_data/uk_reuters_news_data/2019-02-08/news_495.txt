secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
on
wednesday
that
there
was
no
direct
evidence
connecting

to
the
murder
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
last
month
in

pompeo
spoke
to
reporters
after
he
and
defense
secretary
jim
mattis
told
the
senate
behind
closed
doors
that
weakening
ties
over
the
killing
would
hurt
national
security
there
is
no
direct
reporting
connecting
the
crown
prince
to
the
order
to
murder
jamal
khashoggi
pompeo
said
however
many
senators
left
the
briefing
saying
otherwise
i
don
t
think
there
s
anybody
in
the
room
that
doesn
t
believe
he
was
responsible
for
it
senator
bob
corker
the
republican
chairman
of
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
told
reporters
after
the
briefing
mbs
has
not
taken
ownership
of
the
death
corker
said
using
the
initials
for
the
crown
prince
the
cia
has
assessed
that
the
crown
prince
had
ordered
the
killing
of
khashoggi
at
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
republican
senator
lindsey
graham
said
he
would
withhold
his
vote
on
any
key
issue
including
a
government
spending
bill
until
he
gets
a
briefing
on
the
topic
from
the
cia
i
am
not
going
to
be
denied
the
ability
to
be
briefed
by
the
cia
that
we
have
oversight
of
about
whether
or
not
their
assessment
supports
my
belief
that
this
could
not
have
happened
without
mbs
knowing
graham
told
reporters
leading
democratic
senators
said
the
intelligence
they
had
seen
convinced
them
