poland
s
ruling
eurosceptic
law
and
justice
pis
scored
limited
gains
in
regional
government
in
sunday
s
election
but
lost
a
race
for
warsaw
mayor
an
exit
poll
showed
laying
bare
divisions
in
poland
over
the
party
s
democracy
record
since
sweeping
into
power
in
pis
has
remained
broadly
popular
benefiting
from
welfare
reforms
nationalist
rhetoric
and
strong
economic
growth
but
critics
at
home
and
abroad
have
accused
it
of
a
tilt
towards
authoritarian
rule
after
moves
to
increase
government
control
over
the
judiciary
and
public
media
that
have
also
fuelled
poland
s
isolation
within
the
european
union
the
party
won
some
percent
of
votes
for
provincial
assemblies
compared
with
percent
in
a
vote
four
years
earlier
and
percent
it
scored
in
the
parliamentary
election
a
coalition
of
centrist
opposition
parties
was
set
to
win
some
percent
an
opinion
poll
by
ipsos
showed
a
strong
showing
for
the
agrarian
psl
party
which
was
on
track
to
win
percent
on
sunday
was
a
blow
for
pis
which
had
focussed
much
of
its
election
campaign
on
winning
the
rural
vote
in
warsaw
however
the
pis
candidate
patryk
jaki
came
in
second
place
after
rafal
trzaskowski
a
centrist
who
unexpectedly
secured
the
office
in
a
first
round
of
voting
by
winning
more
than
percent
of
votes
if
confirmed
the
results
will
mean
pis
could
struggle
to
keep
its
support
base
during
a
parliamentary
election
in
late
and
a
presidential
vote
a
year
later
pis
leader
jaroslaw
kaczynski
said
the
party
s
showing
on
sunday
bodes
well
for
next
year
but
he
added
we
have
to
work
work
and
work
some
pis
leader
told
party
activists
after
exit
polls
came
out
the
election
campaign
is
final
results
of
the
election
will
be
released
by
the
electoral
commission
by
the
middle
of
the
week
the
election
is
part
of
a
larger
battle
over
europe
s
future
as
brexit
and
hungary
s
viktor
orban
who
like
pis
believes
the
eu
s
powers
should
be
reined
in
shake
up
the
bloc
and
parties
make
gains
across
the
continent
with
brussels
entering
campaign
mode
ahead
of
a
european
parliament
election
in
may
the
polish
vote
could
give
some
hints
on
whether
eurosceptic
groups
can
secure
a
stronger
voice
and
thwart
further
eu
integration
i
d
say
its
a
tie
with
some
advantage
for
the
opposition
said
warsaw
university
political
scientist
rafal
chwedoruk
of
the
polish
vote
while
exit
poll
results
can
not
give
a
clear
indication
of
how
many
of
poland
s
provincial
assemblies
will
fall
under
pis
control
any
gains
will
mean
better
access
to
local
funding
that
could
affect
a
general
election
in
since
the
election
pis
only
controls
one
such
assembly
i
don
t
believe
in
a
liberal
democracy
because
it
leads
to
anarchy
said
stanis≈Çaw
lawniczak
a
real
estate
manager
who
voted
for
pis
candidates
in
warsaw
the
turnout
in
the
election
topped
percent
and
was
the
highest
in
a
regional
vote
since
poland
overthrew
communism
in
an
indication
of
divisions
that
may
have
galvanised
voters
winning
warsaw
a
bastion
of
protests
since
was
seen
as
the
top
prize
in
the
election
with
pis
jaki
vowing
city
hall
under
his
leadership
would
side
with
ordinary
people
against
what
he
calls
arrogant
liberal
elites
a
eu
emissary
for
the
centrist
civic
platform
party
trzaskowski
had
promised
the
capital
would
remain
open
tolerant
and
european
i
hope
the
victory
in
warsaw
is
the
first
step
and
that
we
will
win
upcoming
votes
it
s
important
for
poland
that
politicians
who
respect
the
rule
of
law
have
access
to
power
trzaskowski
said
after
exit
polls
came
out
underlining
divisions
the
eu
s
top
court
ordered
the
warsaw
government
on
friday
to
suspend
an
overhaul
of
the
supreme
court
and
reinstate
judges
forced
into
early
retirement
the
moves
were
part
of
broader
reforms
of
the
judiciary
which
pis
says
are
crucial
to
making
the
system
more
fair
and
efficient
but
opponents
say
they
are
an
attack
on
democratic
checks
and
balances
