trade
dealers
said
the

was
also
boosted
by
a
report
in
britain

on

that
h

h
m
has
seen
profits
shrink
and
inventories
pile
up
over
the
past
couple
of
years
as
its
core
budget
brand
has
lost
sales
to
rivals
like
primark
and
forever
as
well
as
online
competitors
such
as
asos
and
zalando
however
the
company
has
invested
heavily
in
digitalisation
cut
prices
and
launched
a
review
of
its
mix
of
stores
and
brands
closing
some
h
m
stores
and
expanding
its
newer
brands
more
quickly
it
is
also
working
on
a
new
h
m
store
concept
the
firm
which
will
report
full
fiscal
figures
on
said
the
steps
it
had
taken
to
face
the
major
shift
within
the
industry
had
contributed
to
gradually
improved
sales
and
increased
share
in
many
markets
we
are
in
a
transition
year
and
see
that
things
are
starting
to
go
in
the
right
direction
nils

s
sales
including
value
added
tax
vat
rose
percent
in
the
period
against
a
mean
reuters
poll
forecast
for
a
percent
increase
they
were
flat
in
the
second
quarter
reported
sales
excluding
vat
were
up
percent
to
billion
swedish

billion
beating
a
forecast
percent
rise
to
billion

bigger

inditex
the
owner
of
zara
last
week
reported
percent
sales
growth
for
the
six
months
to
the
end
of
july
and
forecast
sales
growth
of
percent
as
well
as
improved
profitability
we
think
h
m
has
done
the
right
thing
in
lowering
entry
point
prices
and
investing
in
its
offer
for
the
long
term
but
expect
this
to
lead
to
margin
pressure
in
the
short
term
rbc
capital
markets
said
in
a
note
lars
soderfjell
portfolio
manager
at
alandsbanken
agreed
noting
sales
were
probably
still
down
to
percent
in
the
quarter
there
is
a
headline
surprise
which
is
enough
to
lift
an
underowned
stock
h
m
shares
have
been
heavily
shorted
recently
which
traders
said
exacerbated
monday
s
recovery
the
stock
has
gyrated
this
year
as
the
founding
persson
family
has
made
large
stock
purchases
stoking
rumours
of
buyout
plans
persson
dismissed
the
talk
in
june
h
m
shares
have
also
lagged
inditex
which
has
been
helped
by
a
more
flexible
supply
chain
and
earlier
integration
of
online
and
stores
with
services
such
as
h
m
is
rolling
out
a
new
logistics
system
to
make
its
supply
chain
faster
and
more
efficient
and
better
integrate
its
more
than
stores
with
its
website
which
vinge
said
had
overall
been
helpful
in
the
quarter
however
the
retailer
said
the
introduction
of
the
system
had
hit
sales
and
raised
costs
in
important
markets
such
as
the
united
states
france
italy
and
belgium
vinge
said
the
logistics
problems
should
be
over
after
the
fourth
quarter
we
have
solved
the
fundamental
problems
it
will
have
an
impact
on
the
fourth
quarter
as
we
have
a
backlog
with
the
supply
of
new
fashion
garments
especially
in
the
but
it
will
be
smaller
for
each
and
every
day
he
said
h
m
has
forecast
a
continued
slowdown
in
comparable
sales
at
its
physical
stores
this
year
and
a
return
to
growth
