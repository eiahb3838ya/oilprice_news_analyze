told
bbc

on
wednesday
lawmakers
have
attempted
to
have
an
increased
say
over
the
brexit
process
if
may
s
deal
is
rejected
by
parliament
but
leadsom
said
that
the
default
position
if

is
for
a
no

a
potentially
disorderly
scenario
unless
government
were
to
do
something
completely
different
to
change
tack
or
indeed
to
pass
this
deal
then
we
will
be
leaving
the

on
march
next
year
without
a
deal
so
it
defaults
to
no
deal
