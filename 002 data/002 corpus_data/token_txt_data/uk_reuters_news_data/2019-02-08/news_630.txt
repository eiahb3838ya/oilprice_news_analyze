and

led
her
party

over
the
security
forces
amnesty

rohingya
calling
it
a
shameful
betrayal
of
the
values
she
once
stood
for
the
global
advocacy
organisation
s
secretary
general
kumi
naidoo
wrote
to
suu
kyi
on
sunday
saying
the
group
was
withdrawing
the

of
hope
courage
and
the
undying
defence
of
human
rights
