explainer: how u.s. congress will negotiate border security deal
washington
reuters
a
struggle
between
president
donald
trump
and
the
congress
to
cut
a
deal
to
end
the
partial
government
shutdown
finally
ended
on
friday
now
the
hard
part
begins
republican
and
democratic
lawmakers
will
have
until
to
craft
a
border
security
agreement
satisfactory
to
both
sides
trump
has
threatened
that
if
he
doesn
t
like
the
outcome
he
could
throw
the
government
right
back
into
shutdown
mode
or
he
also
said
he
might
try
declaring
a
national
emergency
which
he
said
would
get
him
the
billion
he
wants
for
a
border
wall
such
a
step
would
also
likely
trigger
a
court
battle
with
democrats
while
trump
did
not
get
that
money
in
friday
s
deal
he
won
a
promise
that
congress
will
work
on
a
department
of
homeland
security
spending
bill
that
contains
border
security
funding
for
the
rest
of
the
fiscal
year
ending
on
here
is
how
the
negotiations
in
congress
are
expected
to
go
a
conference
committee
will
be
appointed
by
senate
republican
leader
mitch
mcconnell
and
democratic
house
of
representatives
speaker
nancy
pelosi
who
led
the
opposition
to
trump
s
demand
that
his
border
wall
money
be
part
of
any
legislation
to
fully
reopen
the
government
the
committee
will
include
members
of
the
house
and
senate
appropriations
panels
they
will
meet
in
public
session
and
in
private
sessions
to
work
on
a
conference
trump
will
try
to
pressure
fellow
republicans
to
insist
on
including
billion
in
the
report
for
his
wall
although
a
white
house
aide
said
on
friday
a
compromise
for
less
would
be
acceptable
democrats
are
likely
to
resist
any
wall
funding
the
committee
will
weigh
different
compromises
including
possibly
billion
in
border
security
spending
resembling
a
request
trump
included
in
his
budget
proposals
to
congress
last
year
higher
sums
are
likely
to
be
debated
too
a
house
democratic
aide
said
the
committee
also
could
consider
major
changes
to
immigration
law
such
as
providing
protection
from
deportation
for
dreamers
those
undocumented
immigrants
who
were
brought
into
the
united
states
when
they
were
minors
the
committee
will
specify
uses
for
any
border
money
in
the
past
congress
has
provided
money
for
physical
barriers
along
the
border
and
for
electronic
sensors
drones
and
other
tools
once
a
deal
is
struck
the
conference
committee
members
will
vote
to
send
it
to
the
house
and
senate
floor
for
passage
under
the
rules
lawmakers
can
try
to
remove
provisions
in
the
agreement
seen
as
outside
the
scope
of
the
conference
committee
if
the
house
and
the
senate
each
pass
the
conference
agreement
it
will
go
to
the
president
for
signing
into
law
if
at
any
point
in
the
process
there
is
a
breakdown
there
is
the
risk
of
government
agencies
being
thrown
back
into
partial
shutdown
after
alternatively
congress
could
pass
another
stopgap
funding
bill
to
give
conferees
a
little
more
time
to
work
out
a
deal
