emotional mahrez seals points for man city at tottenham
manchester
city
returned
to
the
premier
league
summit
on
goal
difference
as
they
dug
out
a
victory
over
tottenham
hotspur
courtesy
of
an
early
goal
by
riyad
mahrez
at
a
subdued
wembley
stadium
on
monday
it
was
not
the
city
of
late
and
tottenham
will
rue
missing
some
good
chances
to
salvage
something
from
a
disjointed
affair
on
a
patchwork
pitch
at
a
wembley
mahrez
caught
tottenham
cold
in
the
sixth
minute
after
a
defensive
mistake
but
despite
city
s
dominance
they
were
missing
their
clinical
edge
on
a
surface
that
looked
more
suitable
for
american
football
after
an
nfl
fixture
a
day
earlier
david
silva
and
mahrez
both
could
have
put
the
game
beyond
tottenham
but
the
hosts
who
were
on
a
winning
run
in
the
league
and
could
have
gone
above
city
into
second
with
a
victory
always
posed
a
threat
dele
alli
returned
from
a
hamstring
injury
for
tottenham
and
his
arrival
as
a
substitute
sparked
some
late
pressure
in
which
erik
lamela
spurned
a
glorious
chance
to
equalise
city
held
firm
for
a
sixth
consecutive
premier
league
clean
sheet
to
knock
liverpool
off
top
spot
they
both
have
points
while
tottenham
have
after
the
tragic
events
of
saturday
in
which
leicester
city
owner
vichai
srivaddhanaprabha
died
alongside
four
other
people
in
a
helicopter
crash
outside
the
king
power
stadium
it
was
fitting
that
mahrez
a
leicester
hero
during
their
title
success
proved
the
matchwinner
the
game
was
only
six
minutes
old
when
city
goalkeeper
ederson
launched
the
ball
forward
and
spurs
right
back
kieran
trippier
made
a
mess
of
his
clearing
header
that
let
in
raheem
sterling
who
squared
for
mahrez
to
fire
home
past
hugo
lloris
the
algerian
celebrated
in
poignant
fashion
by
raising
both
arms
towards
the
heavens
i
am
very
very
sad
that
is
why
when
i
scored
i
put
my
hands
in
the
sky
for
him
mahrez
who
was
voted
pfa
player
of
the
year
after
leicester
s
stunning
title
said
of
vichai
s
death
he
did
a
lot
for
me
and
leicester
and
it
is
difficult
to
speak
about
it
is
very
city
coach
pep
guardiola
said
there
was
never
any
chance
he
would
leave
mahrez
out
sometimes
to
play
in
a
big
game
helps
he
said
he
did
really
good
he
was
focused
and
did
a
great
spurs
appeared
to
lack
confidence
in
the
opening
stages
and
city
threatened
every
time
they
went
forward
mahrez
had
another
shot
turned
onto
the
post
by
lloris
while
silva
fired
straight
at
the
french
keeper
city
s
defending
was
sloppy
at
times
though
and
tottenham
striker
harry
kane
whizzed
one
shot
narrowly
over
and
then
his
touch
let
him
down
as
he
was
played
through
by
lamela
after
a
mistake
by
aymeric
laporte
the
halftime
interval
featured
a
message
for
ailing
spurs
maestro
glenn
hoddle
who
suffered
a
heart
attack
on
saturday
and
mauricio
pochettino
s
side
could
have
used
some
of
hoddle
s
flair
as
they
toiled
way
city
should
have
buried
the
hosts
in
the
minute
when
bernardo
silva
played
in
namesake
david
but
the
spaniard
inexplicably
opted
not
to
shoot
with
the
goal
gaping
leaving
guardiola
angrily
kicking
the
air
sterling
was
also
guilty
of
a
miss
but
tottenham
grew
in
belief
and
when
alli
rolled
the
ball
across
the
area
for
an
unmarked
lamela
the
argentine
looked
set
to
equalise
but
lifted
his
shot
over
the
crossbar
