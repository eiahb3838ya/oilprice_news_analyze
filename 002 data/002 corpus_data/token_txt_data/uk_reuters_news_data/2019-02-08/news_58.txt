skirting u.s. sanctions, europeans open new trade channel to iran
reuters
france
germany
and
britain
have
opened
a
new
channel
for
trade
with
iran
to
avert
sanctions
although
diplomats
say
it
is
unlikely
to
allow
for
the
big
transactions
that
tehran
says
it
needs
to
keep
a
nuclear
deal
afloat
washington
s
major
european
allies
opposed
last
year
s
decision
by
president
donald
trump
to
abandon
the
deal
under
which
international
sanctions
on
iran
were
lifted
in
return
for
tehran
accepting
curbs
on
its
nuclear
programme
iran
has
threatened
to
pull
out
of
the
deal
unless
the
european
powers
enable
it
to
receive
economic
benefits
the
europeans
have
promised
to
help
companies
do
business
with
iran
as
long
as
it
abides
by
the
deal
it
is
a
political
act
french
foreign
minister
le
drian
told
reporters
after
a
meeting
of
eu
counterparts
in
bucharest
it
is
a
gesture
to
protect
european
washington
says
that
although
iran
has
met
the
terms
the
accord
was
too
generous
failing
to
rein
in
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
or
curb
its
regional
meddling
new
sanctions
have
largely
succeeded
in
persuading
european
companies
to
abandon
business
with
iran
and
washington
said
on
thursday
that
it
did
not
expect
the
eu
effort
known
as
the
special
purpose
vehicle
spv
to
change
that
we
do
not
expect
the
spv
will
in
any
way
impact
our
maximum
economic
pressure
campaign
a
state
department
spokeswoman
said
the
united
states
questions
the
efficacy
of
the
spv
and
remains
committed
to
fully
enforcing
its
sanctions
said
a
senior
trump
administration
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
the
european
trade
vehicle
was
conceived
as
a
way
to
help
match
iranian
oil
and
gas
exports
against
purchases
of
eu
goods
however
those
ambitions
have
been
toned
down
with
diplomats
saying
that
realistically
it
will
be
used
only
for
smaller
trade
for
example
of
humanitarian
products
or
food
it
won
t
change
things
dramatically
but
it
s
an
important
political
message
to
iran
to
show
that
we
are
determined
to
save
the
jcpoa
iran
deal
and
also
to
the
united
states
to
show
we
defend
our
interests
despite
their
extraterritorial
sanctions
one
european
diplomat
said
the
eu
has
spent
months
preparing
the
system
and
it
will
take
several
months
more
to
become
operational
britain
s
jeremy
hunt
said
the
three
countries
were
working
closely
with
tehran
to
finalise
arrangements
registration
is
a
big
step
but
there
is
still
more
work
to
be
done
hunt
said
the
instrument
in
support
of
trade
exchanges
or
instex
is
registered
in
france
and
will
be
headed
by
german
banker
per
fischer
a
former
commerzbank
director
the
three
european
powers
are
shareholders
and
hope
other
states
will
join
later
although
a
senior
german
official
said
this
was
not
imminent
iranian
deputy
foreign
minister
abbas
araqchi
said
the
mechanism
was
a
good
first
step
the
european
powers
must
now
establish
a
budget
for
instex
and
define
its
rules
iran
must
also
set
up
a
mirror
company
it
seems
that
iran
should
set
up
the
same
system
inside
iran
to
organise
rial
transactions
for
iranian
companies
araqchi
was
quoted
as
saying
by
the
tasnim
news
agency
the
embassy
in
germany
said
it
did
not
expect
instex
to
blunt
its
effort
to
pile
economic
pressure
on
tehran
even
as
european
powers
and
the
european
union
have
worked
to
preserve
the
nuclear
deal
relations
with
tehran
have
been
worsening
the
eu
this
month
imposed
its
first
sanctions
on
iran
since
the
nuclear
pact
in
response
to
the
ballistic
missile
tests
and
assassination
plots
on
european
soil
in
a
symbolic
move
the
eu
added
two
iranian
individuals
and
an
iranian
intelligence
unit
to
its
terrorist
list
the
three
big
european
powers
are
also
assessing
whether
to
push
for
new
sanctions
on
iran
over
its
missile
programme
diplomats
have
told
reuters
we
are
clear
this
commitment
does
not
in
any
way
preclude
us
from
addressing
iran
s
hostile
and
destabilising
activities
