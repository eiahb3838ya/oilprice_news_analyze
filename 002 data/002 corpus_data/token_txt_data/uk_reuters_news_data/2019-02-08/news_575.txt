chico
reuters
thousands
of
people
displaced
by
california
s
most
destructive
wildfire
including
hundreds
living
in
tents
and
cars
face
heavy
rains
next
week
that
could
trigger
dangerous
floods
and
mudslides
while
helping
douse
the
flames
at
least
people
who
fled
the
camp
fire
were
sheltering
on
friday
in
the
parking
lot
of
a
walmart
in
chico
about
miles
km
west
of
where
the
blaze
consumed
the
mountain
town
of
paradise
on
more
than
are
missing
according
to
police
the
remains
of
at
least
people
have
been
identified
so
far
a
rain
storm
is
forecast
to
hit
next
week
and
so
authorities
are
asking
people
to
leave
the
walmart
lot
by
sunday
afternoon
said
bryan
may
a
spokesman
for
the
california
office
of
emergency
services
hillsides
that
have
been
scorched
by
a
wildfire
are
at
risk
for
mudslides
when
it
rains
experts
say
the
flames
burn
away
vegetation
that
holds
the
soil
in
place
and
bake
a
waxy
layer
into
the
earth
that
prevents
water
from
sinking
more
than
a
few
inches
into
the
ground
authorities
say
they
have
enough
shelter
space
to
provide
a
bed
for
everyone
who
wants
one
but
they
acknowledge
challenges
ahead
in
finding
more
housing
for
the
displaced
may
said
it
was
not
clear
exactly
how
many
people
are
in
need
of
housing
but
at
the
height
of
the
camp
fire
authorities
had
ordered
more
than
people
to
evacuate
a
survey
found
only
housing
units
available
for
rent
in
all
of
butte
county
where
the
fire
has
been
burning
may
said
already
more
than
people
are
bunking
at
shelters
in
the
area
according
to
the
red
cross
and
countless
more
are
staying
with
friends
and
family
the
fire
forced
caregiver
robin
tompkins
and
her
family
from
their

in
the
town
of
magalia
north
of
paradise
friends

a
week
but
now
the
family
needs
to
find
other
accommodation
she
said
at
an
evacuee
relief
station
in
the
chico
walmart
parking
lot
her
husband
timothy
who
works
as
a
cook
at
a
chico
cafe
was
frustrated
by
the
lack
of

about

long
he
might
be
kept
from

to
magalia
i
keep
hearing
different
things

us
greb
said
everybody
has
been
doing
their
the
walmart
tent
village
is
the
largest
of
several
outdoor
encampments
of
refugees
from
the
camp
fire
some
displaced
people
prefer
to
remain
outdoors
because
they
want
to
stay
with
their
pets
which
many
shelters
say
they
can
not
accept
or
are
concerned
about
losing
their
privacy
may
said
but
authorities
are
encouraging
them
to
camp
near
a
shelter
so
they
can
access
services
for
hygiene
and
other
needs
such
as
free
diapers
and
clorox
wipes
given
the
shortage
of
suitable
housing
attention
has
turned
to
the
federal
emergency
management
agency
it
has
said
that
it
is
working
with
state
and
local
officials
to
evaluate
options
and
is
considering
using
travel
trailers
to
house
some
of
the
displaced
last
year
after
a
deadly
wildfire
destroyed
hundreds
of
homes
in
the
san

of
santa
rosa
