statement
of
carlos
ghosn
your
honour
i
am
grateful
to
finally
have
the
opportunity
to
speak
publicly
i
look
forward
to
beginning
the
process
of
defending
myself
against
the
accusations
that
have
been
made
against
me
first
let
me
say
that
i
have
a
genuine
love
and
appreciation
for
nissan
i
believe
strongly
that
in
all
of
my
efforts
on
behalf
of
the
company
i
have
acted
honourably
legally
and
with
the
knowledge
and
approval
of
the
appropriate
executives
inside
the
company
with
the
sole
purpose
of
supporting
and
strengthening
nissan
and
helping
to
restore
its
place
as
one
of
japan
s
finest
and
most
respected
companies
now
i
would
like
to
address
the
allegations
the
fx
forward
contracts
when
i
first
joined
nissan
and
moved
to
japan
almost
years
ago
i
wanted
to
be
paid
in
dollars
but
was
told
that
was
not
possible
and
was
given
an
employment
contract
that
required
me
to
be
paid
in
japanese
yen
i
have
long
been
concerned
about
the
volatility
of
the
yen
relative
to
the
dollar
i
am
a
individual
my
children
live
in
the
and
i
have
strong
ties
to
lebanon
whose
currency
has
a
fixed
exchange
rate
against
the
dollar
i
wanted
predictability
in
my
income
in
order
to
help
me
take
care
of
my
family
to
deal
with
this
issue
i
entered
into
foreign
exchange
contracts
throughout
my
tenure
at
nissan
beginning
in
two
such
contracts
are
at
issue
in
this
proceeding
one
was
signed
in
when
the
nissan
stock
price
was
around
yen
and
the
rate
was
around
the
other
was
signed
in
when
the
nissan
stock
price
was
around
yen
and
the
exchange
rate
was
around
the
financial
crisis
caused
nissan
s
shares
to
plummet
to
yen
in
october
and
to
yen
in
february
down
more
than
from
its
peak
and
the
exchange
rate
dropped
below
it
was
a
perfect
storm
that
no
one
predicted
the
entire
banking
system
was
frozen
and
the
bank
asked
for
an
immediate
increase
in
my
collateral
on
the
contracts
which
i
could
not
satisfy
on
my
own
i
was
faced
with
two
stark
choices
resign
from
nissan
so
that
i
could
receive
my
retirement
allowance
which
i
could
then
use
to
provide
the
necessary
collateral
but
my
moral
commitment
to
nissan
would
not
allow
me
to
step
down
during
that
crucial
time
a
captain
doesn
t
jump
ship
in
the
middle
of
a
storm
ask
nissan
to
temporarily
take
on
the
collateral
so
long
as
it
came
to
no
cost
to
the
company
while
i
gathered
collateral
from
my
other
sources
i
chose
option
the
fx
contracts
were
then
transferred
back
to
me
without
nissan
incurring
any
loss
khaled
juffali
khaled
juffali
has
been
a
supporter
and
partner
of
nissan
during
a
very
difficult
period
khaled
juffali
company
helped
nissan
solicit
financing
and
helped
nissan
solve
a
complicated
problem
involving
a
local
distributor
indeed
juffali
helped
nissan
restructure
struggling
distributors
throughout
the
gulf
region
enabling
nissan
to
better
compete
with
rivals
like
toyota
which
was
outperforming
nissan
juffali
also
assisted
nissan
in
negotiating
the
development
of
a
manufacturing
plant
in
saudi
arabia
organising
meetings
with
saudi
officials
khaled
juffali
company
was
appropriately
compensated
an
amount
disclosed
to
and
approved
by
the
appropriate
officers
at
nissan
in
exchange
for
these
critical
services
that
substantially
benefited
nissan
fiel
allegations
four
major
companies
sought
to
recruit
me
while
i
was
ceo
of
nissan
including
ford
by
bill
ford
and
general
motors
by
steve
rattner
the
czar
under
president
barack
obama
even
though
their
proposals
were
very
attractive
i
could
not
in
good
conscience
abandon
nissan
while
we
were
in
the
midst
of
our
turnaround
nissan
is
an
iconic
japanese
company
that
i
care
about
deeply
although
i
chose
not
to
pursue
the
other
opportunities
i
did
keep
a
record
of
the
market
compensation
for
my
role
which
those
companies
offered
me
if
i
had
taken
these
jobs
this
was
an
internal
benchmark
that
i
kept
for
my
own
future
reference
it
had
no
legal
effect
it
was
never
shared
with
the
directors
and
it
never
represented
any
kind
of
binding
commitment
in
fact
the
various
proposals
for
and
advisory
services
made
by
some
members
of
the
board
did
not
reflect
or
reference
my
internal
calculations
underscoring
their
hypothetical
nature
contrary
to
the
accusations
made
by
the
prosecutors
i
never
received
any
compensation
from
nissan
that
was
not
disclosed
nor
did
i
ever
enter
into
any
binding
contract
with
nissan
to
be
paid
a
fixed
amount
that
was
not
disclosed
moreover
i
understood
that
any
draft
proposals
for
compensation
were
reviewed
by
internal
and
external
lawyers
showing
i
had
no
intent
to
violate
the
law
for
me
the
test
is
the
death
test
if
i
died
today
could
my
heirs
require
nissan
to
pay
anything
other
than
my
retirement
allowance
the
answer
is
an
unequivocal
contribution
to
nissan
i
have
dedicated
two
decades
of
my
life
to
reviving
nissan
and
building
the
alliance
i
worked
towards
these
goals
day
and
night
on
the
earth
and
in
the
air
standing
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
hardworking
nissan
employees
around
the
globe
to
create
value
the
fruits
of
our
labours
have
been
extraordinary
we
transformed
nissan
moving
it
from
a
position
of
a
debt
of
trillion
yen
in
to
cash
of
trillion
yen
at
the
end
of
from
million
cars
sold
in
at
a
significant
loss
to
million
cars
sold
profitably
in
nissan
s
asset
base
tripled
during
the
period
we
saw
the
revival
of
icons
like
the
fairlady
z
and
nissan
nissan
s
industrial
entry
into
wuhon
china
petersburg
russia
chennai
india
and
resende
brazil
the
pioneering
of
a
mass
market
for
electric
cars
with
the
leaf
the
jumpstarting
of
autonomous
cars
the
introduction
of
mitsubishi
motors
to
the
alliance
and
the
alliance
becoming
the
number
one
auto
group
in
the
world
in
producing
more
than
million
cars
annually
we
created
directly
and
indirectly
countless
jobs
in
japan
and
nissan
as
a
pillar
of
the
japanese
economy
these
accomplishments
secured
alongside
the
peerless
team
of
nissan
employees
worldwide
are
the
greatest
joy
of
my
life
next
to
my
family
your
honour
i
am
innocent
of
the
accusations
made
against
me
i
have
always
acted
with
integrity
and
have
never
been
accused
of
any
wrongdoing
in
my
professional
career
i
have
been
wrongly
accused
and
unfairly
detained
based
on
meritless
and
unsubstantiated
accusations
thank
you
your
honour
for
listening
to
me
