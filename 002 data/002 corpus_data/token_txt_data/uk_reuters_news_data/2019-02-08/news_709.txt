bank of england to stay in 'suspended animation' after halloween meeting
london
reuters
britain
s
central
bank
is
expected
to
keep
interest
rates
steady
on
thursday
after
a
halloween
policy
meeting
which
economists
said
would
leave
plans
to
raise
borrowing
costs
in
suspended
animation
rather
than
zombie
companies
or
supernatural
forces
it
is
the
more
familiar
bogeyman
of
an
economically
damaging
brexit
which
is
almost
certain
to
keep
the
bank
of
england
on
hold
after
its
last
interest
rate
rise
three
months
ago
until
a
deal
is
done
or
not
we
suspect
the
boe
is
in
suspended
animation

economist
robert
wood
wrote
in
a
note
to
clients
a
year
ago
the
boe
raised
interest
rates
for
the
first
time
since
the
global
financial
crisis
and
followed
this
with
a
further
rise
in
borrowing
costs
to
percent
in
august
economists
polled
by
reuters
expect
the
nine
members
of
the
boe
s
monetary
policy
committee
to
have
voted
unanimously
to
keep
rates
on
hold
this
month
and
on
average
do
not
see
a
further
rate
rise
until
may
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
european
union
on
march
next
year
but
prime
minister
theresa
may
has
yet
to
secure
a
transitional
deal
that
will
ensure
goods
and
people
can
continue
to
move
freely
between
britain
and
the
eu
the
day
after
the
pound
s
fall
against
the
dollar
and
the
euro
after
june
s
brexit
vote
pushed
inflation
to
a
near
high
of
percent
last
year
the
effects
of
this
are
now
fading
and
inflation
dropped
to
percent
in
september
but
some
boe
policymakers
are
concerned
that
a
in
wage
growth
this
year
will
delay
inflation
s
return
to
its
percent
target
stripping
out
volatile
bonuses
annual
pay
growth
in
the
three
months
to
august
rose
to
percent
its
biggest
rise
since
january
prompting
boe
chief
economist
andy
haldane
to
talk
of
a
new
dawn
for
pay
growth
other
officials
such
as
deputy
governor
jon
cunliffe
are
more
sceptical
and
recent
consumer
data
has
shown
slower
spending
after
a
summer
splurge
which
was
driven
by
unusually
warm
weather
the
boe
will
update
its
growth
and
inflation
forecasts
on
thursday
some
economists
expect
the
inflation
forecast
to
come
in
a
fraction
closer
to
percent
than
in
august
as
a
stronger
currency
and
higher
global
interest
rates
offset
the
inflationary
potential
of
higher
wages
growth
for
this
year
was
forecast
at
a
lacklustre
percent
in
august
due
to
heavy
snow
hitting
the
economy
at
the
start
of
the
year
and
the
boe
is
likely
to
stick
with
predictions
of
a
in
assuming
brexit
goes
smoothly
boe
governor
mark
carney
said
in
august
that
market
expectations
of
about
one
basis
point
rate
rise
a
year
was
a
good
rule
of
thumb
for
households
and
economists
see
no
shift
from
this
broad
approach
on
thursday
as
we
approach
the
endgame
for
brexit
transition
talks
we
do
not
expect
the
boe
to
make
changes
to
its
guidance
