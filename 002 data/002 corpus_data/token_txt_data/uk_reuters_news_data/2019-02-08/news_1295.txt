retired
south
korean
farmer
hwang
would
love
to
see
his
mother
again
but
nearly
years
after
he
last
set
eyes
on
her
he
says
he
would
settle
for
a
photograph
too
much
time
has
passed
by
and
it
is
over
now
he
told
reuters
standing
near
his
home
within
sight
of
the
north
korean
border
i
don
t
think
she
is
during
the
korean
war
which
raged
up
and
down
the
peninsula
for
three
years
hwang
s
family
fled
here
to
gyodong
island
in
what
is
now
south
korea
but
his
mother
returned
to
their
home
in
the
north
to
prepare
for
a
hoped
for
peace
and
was
caught
on
the
northern
side
of
the
heavily
fortified
border
that
divided
the
two
koreas
after
the
armistice
hwang
now
stayed
on
gyodong
island
even
building
a
home
within
sight
of
north
korea
hoping
one
day
his
mother
would
return
so
far
there
has
only
been
silence
with
tensions
on
the
korean
peninsula
easing
north
and
south
korea
plan
to
revive
the
family
reunions
that
were
halted
three
years
ago
as
concerns
over
pyongyang
s
nuclear
and
missile
programmes
mounted
more
than
south
korean
survivors
are
registered
with
the
south
korean
government
hoping
for
a
shot
at
a
brief
meeting
with
loved
ones
just
south
koreans
and
north
koreans
have
been
selected
for
a
new
round
of
reunions
that
will
begin
on
august
at
a
resort
in
north
korea
s
mt
kumgang
a
popular
tourist
region
i
still
cry
whenever
i
talk
about
my
family
i
will
probably
cry
again
once
i
see
them
said
bae
who
was
picked
to
meet
her
sisters
for
the
first
time
since
the
war
i
was
utterly
in
shock
after
hearing
that
i
was
hwang
the
retired
farmer
was
not
one
of
the
few
picked
for
this
new
round
of
meetings
when
can
we
meet
our
loved
ones
he
asked
after
all
of
us
are
dead
people
per
each
event
is
just
meaningless
there
are
people
waiting
all
over
the
his
question
is
not
entirely
rhetorical
since
south
koreans
have
added
their
names
to
a
government
registry
hoping
to
reunite
with
their
families
but
survivors
of
the
war
are
aging
rapidly
and
people
on
that
list
have
already
died
the
vast
majority
without
ever
having
seen
their
relatives
again
in
a
decade
most
of
the
survivors
already
in
their
or
will
have
died
said
cheong
vice
president
of
research
planning
at
seoul
s
sejong
institute
that
is
why
the
reunion
programme
is
a
matter
of
urgency
an
extremely
pressing
matter
he
said
park
who
lives
in
goyang
city
near
the
north
korean
border
didn
t
want
to
wait
on
the
government
during
a
period
of
closer
relations
in
the
she
unsuccessfully
searched
for
her
family
during
three
tightly
controlled
tours
in
north
korea
once
glimpsing
her
old
home
briefly
from
the
window
of
a
tour
bus
all
i
wanted
was
to
tell
my
mom
how
i
lived
but
she
is
dead
now
park
said
i
miss
my
brothers
it
s
so
hurtful
leaving
them
for
many
survivors
the
reunions
offer
the
first
details
of
their
family
s
fate
following
the
war
that
left
more
than
million
dead
i
will
probably
ask
them
how
they
have
been
and
when
mother
died
bae
said
of
her
sisters
that
s
what
i
want
to
south
and
north
korea
first
agreed
to
hold
reunions
after
a
historic
summit
in
the
reunions
were
held
every
year
until
over
that
period
people
were
picked
by
a
computer
which
prioritises
them
on
factors
including
their
age
and
family
background
others
are
selected
when
their
relatives
in
the
north
request
a
meeting
i
could
not
believe
it
at
first
i
thought
i
was
being
scammed
said
kim
describing
her
shock
when
her
daughter
and
granddaughter
in
north
korea
asked
to
meet
her
in
many
of
those
selected
however
say
being
torn
away
after
seeing
their
relatives
for
only
a
few
hours
under
the
watchful
eye
of
north
korean
guards
is
a
traumatic
experience
when
the
time
was
up
i
let
go
of
my
daughter
s
hand
and
went
to
the
bus
kim
said
the
moment
i
sat
down
i
could
not
kim
said
she
wants
to
see
her
family
again
before
she
dies
but
with
north
korea
still
largely
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
those
who
have
already
had
reunions
ruled
out
of
the
selection
process
that
seems
increasingly
unlikely
she
is
alive
and
i
can
t
see
her
anymore
for
the
rest
of
my
life
can
you
even
imagine
that
