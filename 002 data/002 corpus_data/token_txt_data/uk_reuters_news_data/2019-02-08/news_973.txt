london
reuters
as
few
as
finance
jobs
have
been
shifted
or
created
overseas
so
far
ahead
of
brexit
while
the
number
of
jobs
that
financial
institutions
said
they
expected
to
move
in
the
event
of
a
hard
brexit
is
a
reuters
survey
shows
nearly
all
of
the
financial
companies
that
responded
to
reuters
third
survey
on
staff
moves
said
that
while
they
continue
to
plan
for
the
scenario
they
are
shifting
as
few
jobs
as
possible
hoping
for
a
political
deal
that
protects
access
after
britain
leaves
the
european
union
on
march
reuters
approached
banks
asset
managers
insurers
ratings
agencies
and
exchanges
with
uk
operations
on
their
plans
and
received
answers
from
against
in
march
when
respondents
predicted
jobs
would
move
the
numbers
of
respondents
are
different
because
some
companies
who
responded
in
march
did
not
do
so
this
time
while
others
were
included
in
the
survey
for
the
first
time
the
first
reuters
survey
in
september
which
collated
answers
from
firms
indicated
roles
would
be
affected
the
survey
was
conducted
by
email
and
telephone
between
and
a
total
of
banks
responded
along
with
insurers
and
insurance
brokers
and
asset
managers
two
exchanges
and
three
ratings
agencies
of
the
companies
that
responded
said
they
would
have
to
move
staff
or
restructure
their
businesses
because
of
brexit
although
only
specified
numbers
the
rest
said
it
would
have
no
impact
that
they
were
still
deciding
what
to
do
or
they
declined
to
comment
many
participants
declined
to
comment
on
several
questions
some
participants
also
asked
for
the
information
to
be
part
of
an
aggregate
only
which
is
why
reuters
has
not
published
the
complete
data
the
respondents
included
the
investment
banks
that
earned
the
most
fees
from
investment
banking
in
europe
the
middle
east
and
africa
in
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
the
insurers
who
responded
to
the
survey
included
the
largest
listed
insurers
in
britain
along
with
large
european
union
and
insurers
operating
in
britain
major
insurance
brokers
and
listed
and
unlisted
insurers
with
an
international
focus
such
as
those
operating
in
the
lloyd
s
of
london
market
the
asset
managers
who
responded
included
many
of
the
global
managers
who
use
the
uk
as
a
base
in
europe
as
well
as
most
of
the
leading
british
firms
survey
participants
were
asked
if
brexit
would
mean
new
jobs
moved
or
created
in
the
european
union
by
march
how
many
had
already
been
moved
or
created
and
what
other
steps
they
were
taking
they
were
also
asked
how
many
uk
employees
they
currently
have
the
employee
numbers
totalled
and
included
employed
by
banks
by
insurers
and
by
asset
managers
the
banks
who
gave
figures
when
asked
the
question
about
how
many
jobs
would
be
affected
by
brexit
said
they
expected
jobs
to
be
moved
or
created
in
the
eu
although
just
had
been
so
far
sixteen
insurers
answered
the
question
by
saying
they
expected
roles
to
be
created
elsewhere
in
the
eu
in
total
of
which
had
been
so
far
fifteen
asset
managers
who
gave
the
information
saw
jobs
in
total
being
created
of
which
had
already
been
moved
or
created
there
are
banks
registered
in
britain
according
to
the
bank
of
england
although
that
includes
the
subsidiaries
of
many
larger
banks
as
well
as
many
smaller
lenders
that
earn
the
bulk
of
their
revenue
in
britain
so
won
t
be
affected
so
much
by
brexit
there
are
uk
authorised
insurers
according
to
the
bank
of
england
though
many
larger
firms
have
more
than
one
authorisation
many
uk
insurers
also
have
a
purely
domestic
focus
insurance
specialists
say
while
the
asset
managers
contacted
account
for
the
lion
s
share
of
the
assets
managed
in
britain
there
remains
a
long
tail
of
smaller
managers
registered
with
the
financial
conduct
authority
a
figure
it
currently
puts
at
firms
