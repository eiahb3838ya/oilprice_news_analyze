demand outlook, emissions worries put brakes on truckmaker volvo
stockholm
reuters
swedish
truckmaker
volvo
forecast
slower
demand
for
trucks
in
europe
and
china
next
year
fuelling
investor
concerns
these
major
markets
may
have
peaked
and
sending
its
shares
into
reverse
it
also
gave
no
clarity
on
the
potential
costs
of
fixing
an
emissions
issue
with
some
trucks
and
buses
sold
in
north
america
and
europe
disclosed
this
week
causing
its
stock
to
fall
percent
despite
its
profit
having
topped
consensus
volvo
which
also
makes
construction
equipment
and
engines
forecast
truck
market
demand
in
china
would
fall
about
percent
to
units
next
year
and
predicted
a
contraction
in
europe
of
about
percent
to
units
it
also
expects
demand
in
the
chinese
construction
market
to
be
between
flat
and
down
percent
its
comments
came
after
china
s
economic
growth
slowed
to
its
weakest
quarterly
pace
since
ceo
martin
lundstedt
blamed
the
volvo
slowdown
in
china
partly
on
the
trade
war
with
the
united
states
but
also
said
new
emission
legislation
had
led
truck
clients
to
hesitate
after
a
number
of
years
of
strong
growth
generally
speaking
there
is
a
certain
worry
about
what
will
happen
when
it
comes
to
tariffs
and
different
other
types
of
uncertainty
in
the
geopolitical
and
macroeconomic
climate
he
told
reuters
but
still
i
think
the
overwhelming
part
of
our
customers
sentiment
is
really
good
activity
in
different
markets
so
what
we
see
that
is
not
really
a
strong
trend
of
a
robust
demand
in
recent
years
has
come
from
a
need
for
truck
buyers
to
renew
fleets
starved
of
investment
during
the
last
downturn
but
the
surge
has
caused
bottlenecks
leaving
volvo
having
to
cope
with
higher
raw
material
and
labor
costs
volvo
in
which
china
s
geely
holding
has
a
percent
stake
said
on
friday
that
supply
chain
were
expected
to
persist
in
north
america
volvo
said
on
tuesday
it
could
face
material
costs
as
some
of
its
engines
could
be
exceeding
limits
set
for
toxic
nitrogen
oxide
emissions
as
catalytic
converters
were
wearing
down
more
quickly
than
expected
in
certain
situations
volvo
management
fielded
multiple
questions
from
analysts
about
the
scale
of
the
issue
and
the
cost
of
dealing
with
it
on
friday
but
provided
little
in
the
way
of
fresh
detail
lundstedt
told
analysts
he
viewed
the
problem
as
a
one
off
rather
than
a
going
concern
adding
that
some
trucks
had
been
fixed
already
and
that
volvo
had
identified
potential
solutions
the
company
reported
a
jump
in
adjusted
operating
profit
to
billion
swedish
crowns
billion
from
billion
topping
the
billion
forecast
in
a
reuters
poll
of
analysts
it
also
showed
progress
in
curbing
costs
with
adjusted
margins
rising
percent
exceeding
its
target
thanks
to
slightly
lower
r
d
costs
and
higher
sales
