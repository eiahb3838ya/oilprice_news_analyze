kingfisher
europe
s
second
largest
home
improvement
retailer
reported
weak
quarterly
sales
in
france
and
said
it
would
pull
out
of
russia
spain
and
portugal
sending
its
shares
lower
and
raising
questions
over
its
plan
to
increase
profit
the
group
which
across
europe
trails
france
s
groupe
adeo
is
in
the
third
year
of
programme
to
raise
annual
profit
by
million
pounds
from
however
profits
are
forecast
to
go
backwards
in
its
year
kingfisher
s
shares
fell
as
much
as
percent
on
wednesday
taking
losses
for
the
year
to
more
than
percent
after
the
group
whose
main
businesses
are
b
q
and
screwfix
in
britain
and
castorama
and
brico
depot
in
france
reported
a
fall
in
underlying
sales
in
its
third
quarter
with
castorama
in
continuing
to
trade
particularly
poorly
and
underperform
the
wider
french
market
chief
executive
v√©ronique
laury
who
has
cut
castorama
s
prices
and
revamped
its
marketing
warned
there
is
no
quick
fix
for
that
business
we
believe
kingfisher
s
transformation
plan
will
not
yield
the
margin
benefits
it
was
supposed
to
so
there
will
be
more
calls
for
a
but
in
between
a
margin
reset
may
be
necessary
said

analyst
richard
chamberlain
who
has
a
sector
perform
rating
on
the
stock
kingfisher
s
sales
fell
percent
in
the
quarter
to
reflecting
the
weak
performance
at
castorama
france
where
sales
on
the
same
basis
slumped
percent
worse
than
analysts
expectations
of
a
fall
of
about
percent
laury
said
the
margin
outlook
in
france
was
uncertain
given
the
difficult
trading
and
the
impact
of
recent
national
fuel
tax
protests
castorama
is
likely
to
be
still
losing
share
to
leroy
merlin
due
to
unified
products
not
resonating
with
customers
and
a
suboptimal
digital
offer
said
rbc
s
chamberlain
kingfisher
s
plan
for
the

pounds
over
five
years

for
the
as
part
of
this
commitment
we
have
taken
the
decision
to
exit
russia
spain
and
portugal
said
laury
this
will
allow
us
to
apply
our
strategy
with
more
focus
and
efficiency
in
our
main
markets
where
we
have
or
can
reach
