serena
williams
squandered
four
match
points
and
blew
a
lead
in
the
deciding
set
as
seventh
seed
karolina
pliskova
produced
a
fightback
for
the
ages
to
claim
a
win
over
the
american
great
at
the
australian
open
on
wednesday
williams
chasing
a
milestone
grand
slam
triumph
also
saved
two
match
points
in
the
last
game
but
netted
on
the
third
as
the
czech
shocked
a
packed
rod
laver
arena
with
her
remarkable
rally
from
the
brink
of
defeat
the
american
s
hopes
of
matching
margaret
court
s
record
of
grand
slam
singles
titles
and
claiming
a
first
since
becoming
a
mother
in
were
denied
once
more
after
she
also
lost
in
finals
at
wimbledon
and
the
open
last
year
while
disappointed
the
was
philosophical
in
defeat
and
pledged
to
regroup
for
another
tilt
at
the
french
open
it
s
definitely
not
easy
for
me
from
day
one
i
expect
to
go
out
and
quite
frankly
to
win
the
champion
in
melbourne
told
reporters
that
hasn
t
happened
but
i
do
like
my
attitude
i
ve
only
been
playing
months
but
i
expect
to
win
and
if
i
don
t
it
s
disappointing
i
rather
think
of
it
that
way
and
know
that
it
s
going
to
happen
sooner
or
later
than
making
an
excuse
for
myself
i
don
t
like
making
the
brave
pliskova
advanced
to
meet
naomi
osaka
in
the
last
four
denying
williams
a
chance
to
avenge
her
controversial
open
final
defeat
to
the
japanese
fourth
seed
normally
i
m
having
a
lot
of
comebacks
but
maybe
from
a
set
down
or
a
break
down
so
nothing
like
this
i
think
it
s
the
best
comeback
ever
so
far
in
my
life
an
elated
pliskova
told
reporters
after
qualifying
for
her
first
melbourne
this
time
i
really
believed
like
she
s
still
a
player
i
know
she
s
the
greatest
ever
but
i
don
t
want
to
put
her
somewhere
where
i
would
not
have
a
chance
to
beat
pliskova
avenged
her
loss
to
williams
at
last
year
s
open
and
now
holds
an
enviable
grand
slam
record
against
the
american
having
beaten
her
in
the

former

and
kvitova

pliskova
will
emerge
as
the
woman
if
she
claims
the
title
williams
seeded
as
she
continues
her
return
from
maternity
leave
rolled
her
ankle
when
serving

for
playing
unbelievable
