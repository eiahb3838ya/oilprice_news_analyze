istanbul
reuters
turkey
s
ruling
party
said
on
monday
jamal
khashoggi
was
the
victim
of
a
monstrously
planned
murder
dismissing
riyadh
s
assertion
he
died
in
a
fight
as
western
incredulity
deepened
over
varying
saudi
accounts
of
the
journalist
s
disappearance
khashoggi
a
washington
post
columnist
and
critic
of
the
powerful
saudi
crown
prince
disappeared
three
weeks
ago
after
he
entered
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
to
obtain
documents
for
an
upcoming
marriage
riyadh
s
reaction
since
it
initially
denied
knowledge
of
his
fate
before
saying
he
was
killed
in
a
fight
in
the
consulate
has
left
several
western
governments
deeply
sceptical
and
strained
ties
with
the
world
s
largest
oil
exporter
ruling
ak
party
spokesman
omer
celik
said
efforts
had
been
made
to
cover
up
the
killing
referring
to
surveillance
footage
aired
by
cnn
showing
a
man
dressed
as
khashoggi
walking
around
istanbul
after
he
vanished
in
an
apparent
attempt
at
deception
we
are
facing
a
situation
that
has
been
monstrously
planned
and
later
tried
to
be
covered
up
it
is
a
complicated
murder
he
told
reporters
we
are
being
careful
so
nobody
tries
to
cover
the
issue
up
the
truth
will
come
out
those
responsible
will
be
punished
something
like
this
will
not
cross
anybody
s
mind
khashoggi
went
missing
on
when
he
entered
the
kingdom
s
consulate
in
istanbul
after
weeks
of
denying
knowledge
of
his
fate
saudi
officials
said
the
prominent
journalist
was
killed
in
a
fistfight
on
sunday
saudi
arabia
s
foreign
minister
adel
said
that
khashoggi
had
died
in
a
rogue
operation
but
some
of
his
comments
appeared
to
contradict
previous
statements
from
riyadh
marking
yet
another
shift
in
the
official
story
several
countries
including
germany
britain
france
and
turkey
have
pressed
riyadh
to
provide
all
the
facts
and
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
berlin
would
not
export
arms
to
saudi
arabia
while
uncertainty
over
khashoggi
s
fate
persisted
one
can
not
help
but
wonder
how
there
could
have
been
a
fistfight
between
young
expert
fighters
and
a
khashoggi
alone
and
defenceless
yasin
aktay
an
adviser
to
turkish
president
tayyip
erdogan
and
a
friend
of
khashoggi
s
wrote
in
the
yeni
safak
newspaper
the
more
one
thinks
about
it
the
more
it
feels
like
our
intelligence
is
being
mocked
he
wrote
erdogan
has
said
he
will
release
information
about
turkey
s
investigation
in
a
speech
on
tuesday
turkish
officials
suspect
khashoggi
was
killed
inside
the
consulate
by
saudi
agents
and
his
body
cut
up
turkish
sources
say
authorities
have
an
audio
recording
purportedly
documenting
the
murder
of
the
a
car
belonging
to
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
was
found
in
the
sultangazi
district
of
the
city
broadcaster
ntv
and
other
local
media
said
on
monday
adding
that
police
would
search
the
vehicle
for
saudi
arabia
s
allies
the
question
will
be
whether
they
believe
that
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
who
has
painted
himself
as
a
reformer
has
any
culpability
king
salman
has
handed
the
running
of
saudi
arabia
to
him
in
some
critical
areas
jubeir
s
explanation
appeared
to
depart
from
previous
official
statements
he
said
the
saudis
did
not
know
how
khashoggi
had
died
that
contradicted
the
public
prosecutor
s
statement
a
day
earlier
that
khashoggi
died
after
a
fistfight
with
people
who
met
him
inside
the
consulate
it
also
contradicted
two
saudi
officials
comments
to
reuters
that
it
was
a
chokehold
that
killed
him
a
member
of
the
team
dressed
in
khashoggi
s
clothes
to
make
it
appear
as
if
he
had
left
the
consulate
a
saudi
official
has
said
support
for
that
strand
of
the
account
appeared
to
come
from
footage
aired
by
cnn
showing
a
man
dressed
as
khashoggi
walking
around
istanbul
cnn
described
the
images
as
law
enforcement
surveillance
footage
some
top
lawmakers
turned
their
ire
on
the
crown
prince
and
said
they
believed
he
ordered
the
killing
do
i
think
he
did
it
yes
i
think
he
did
it
republican
senator
bob
corker
the
influential
chairman
of
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
said
in
an
interview
with
cnn
over
the
course
of
the
crisis
trump
s
comments
have
varied
from
appearing
to
downplay
riyadh
s
role
in
the
incident
to
warning
of
potential
economic
sanctions
he
has
repeatedly
highlighted
the
kingdom
s
importance
as
