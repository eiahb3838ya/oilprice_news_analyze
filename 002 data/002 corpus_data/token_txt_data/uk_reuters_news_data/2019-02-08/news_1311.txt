barclays
has
begun
shifting
direct
ownership
of
its
french
german
and
spanish
branches
from
a
entity
to
its
irish
bank
according
to
sources
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
plans
ahead
of
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
the
move
shows
barclays
putting
its
brexit
contingency
plans
into
action
in
common
with
other
banks
which
are
not
waiting
for
the
outcome
of
negotiations
over
how
financial
services
will
operate
after
britain
leaves
the
eu
in
march
the
british
bank
outlined
plans
to
expand
its
irish
entity
in
a
slide
presentation
to
investors
earlier
this
month
saying
the
unit
would
primarily
consist
of
barclays
corporate
investment
and
private
banking
activities
and
its
barclaycard
credit
card
business
in
germany
in
addition
to
the
french
german
and
spanish
branches
barclays
will
ultimately
move
all
of
its
european
branches
under
control
of
barclays
bank
ireland
one
of
the
sources
said
its
other
main
corporate
and
investment
banking
businesses
in
europe
include
luxembourg
switzerland
portugal
italy
and
the
netherlands
according
to
a
reuters
review
of
company
filings
barclays
bank
ireland
will
have
total
assets
of
around
billion
pounds
after
absorbing
all
the
european
business
barclays
said
in
its
presentation
to
investors
out
of
trillion
pounds
for
the
entire
bank
as
of
the
end
of
barclays
no
longer
operates
a
consumer
banking
business
in
europe
having
sold
the
last
of
its
retail
operation
in
as
the
bank
shifted
its
global
strategy
to
focus
on
the
united
states
and
britain
while
barclays
european
branches
will
still
ultimately
be
owned
by
its
holding
company
the
change
in
organisational
structure
shows
how
lenders
are
shifting
business
to
try
to
avoid
any
disruption
that
brexit
might
cause
banks
are
trying
to
ensure
that
even
under
a
scenario
where
britain
would
crash
out
of
the
eu
without
any
agreements
in
place
they
would
still
be
able
to
serve
eu
customers
as
before
british
banks
have
largely
chosen
to
base
their
main
european
hubs
wherever
they
already
have
a
suitably
licensed
existing
subsidiary
as
they
seek
to
minimise
costs
and
inconvenience
in
the
event
a
deal
renders
the
reorganisations
unnecessary
barclays
rival
hsbc
has
begun
shifting
direct
ownership
of
its
european
branches
from
its
british
entity
to
its
french
subsidiary
while
lloyds
is
planning
three
eu
subsidiaries
