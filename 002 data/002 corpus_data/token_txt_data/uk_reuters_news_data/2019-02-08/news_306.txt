the

blamed
the

know
that
with
every
attack
they
carry
out
against
our
people
our
resolve
is
further
strengthened

their
conduct
is
a
disgrace

very
notion

considering
pulling
out
at

of
the
troops
currently
deployed
in
afghanistan
the
possibility
of
thousands
of
troops
leaving
has
triggered
confusion
and
panic
in
the
kabul
government
and
foreign
missions
who
fear
that
sudden
withdrawal
would
lead
to
the
return
of
the
taliban
regime
who
are
fighting
to
expel
foreign
forces
topple
the
government
and
restore
their
version
of
