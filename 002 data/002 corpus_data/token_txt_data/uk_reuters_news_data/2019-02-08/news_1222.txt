uk says brexit could hit banks' stock of 'risk free' eu debt
london
reuters
britain
could
force
european
union
banks
operating
in
london
to
start
holding
capital
against
inventory
of
riskier
eu
government
bonds
in
the
case
of
a
brexit
at
part
of
preparations
for
britain
s
departure
from
european
union
next
march
the
finance
ministry
has
published
a
statutory
instrument
or
si
to
help
transfer
eu
rules
like
financial
regulation
into
national
law
to
avoid
a
legal
void
on
the
first
day
of
brexit
banks
in
the
eu
don
t
have
to
hold
capital
against
holdings
of
their
own
government
s
bonds
a
rule
known
as
zero
risk
weight
as
such
domestic
debt
is
considered
risk
free
the
government
said
in
its
si
published
on
tuesday
that
if
britain
leaves
the
bloc
with
no
transition
deal
next
march
the
eu
would
automatically
become
a
third
country
this
means
that
the
zero
risk
weight
rule
would
no
longer
apply
to
eu
banks
in
britain
therefore
this
si
will
remove
preferential
treatment
for
exposures
the
document
said
the
si
acknowledges
that
the
same
change
would
be
made
by
the
eu
when
regulating
british
banks
operating
in
the
bloc
after
brexit
the
finance
ministry
said
it
plans
to
put
the
si
to
parliament
in
the
autumn
the
intention
of
this
si
is
not
to
make
policy
changes
other
than
to
reflect
the
uk
s
new
position
outside
the
eu
and
to
smooth
the
transition
to
this
position
the
finance
ministry
said
the
zero
risk
weight
rule
is
based
on
a
global
standard
from
the
basel
committee
of
banking
supervisors
it
became
discredited
when
a
sharp
deterioration
in
greek
irish
portuguese
and
spanish
government
bonds
during
the
euro
zone
debt
crisis
showed
that
such
debt
can
be
risky
and
feed
a
doom
loop
to
drag
down
lenders
efforts
to
change
the
rule
at
the
global
level
have
dragged
on
as
the
issue
is
seen
as
politically
sensitive
in
the
euro
zone
where
introducing
capital
charges
could
prompt
lenders
to
ditch
the
bonds
of
governments
with
lower
credit
ratings
to
minimize
capital
requirements
