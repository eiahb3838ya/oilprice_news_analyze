wonder
appeared
to
respond
in
part
to
williams
when
he
delivered
remarks
at
the
end
of
the
service
following
his
own
musical
tribute
to
franklin
we
can
talk
about
all
the
things
that
are
wrong
and
there
are
many
but
the
only
thing
that
can
deliver
us
is
love
so
what
needs
to
happen
today
not
only
in
this
nation
but
throughout
the
world
is
that
we
need
to
make
love
great
again
wonder
said
because
black
lives
do
matter
because
all
lives
do
matter
and
if
we
love
god
then
we
know
truly
that
it
is
our
love
that
will
make
all
things
matter
when
we
make
love
great
again
that
is
what
aretha
has
said
throughout
her
life
throughout
the
pain
she
gave
us
the
joy
and
said
let
s
make
love
great
again
