washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
pledged
on
sunday
not
to
bend
in
his
demand
for
a
wall
along
the
southern
border
with
mexico
but
said
the
barrier
could
be
made
of
steel
instead
of
concrete
as
a
potential
compromise
with
democrats
who
refuse
to
fund
it
trump
s
comments
came
at
the
start
of
the
third
week
of
a
partial
government
shutdown
resulting
from
the
dispute
that
has
left
hundreds
of
thousands
of
federal
workers
idled
or
without
paychecks
trump
threatened
again
without
providing
specifics
on
where
the
funding
would
originate
to
declare
a
national
emergency
as
an
alternative
way
to
build
the
wall
depending
on
the
outcome
of
talks
in
the
coming
days
democrats
have
declined
to
approve
the
billion
billion
pounds
trump
wants
to
fulfil
a
campaign
promise
to
curb
illegal
immigration
led
by
new
speaker
nancy
pelosi
democrats
passed
a
bill
in
the
house
of
representatives
last
week
to
reopen
the
government
without
wall
funding
pelosi
has
called
a
border
wall
immoral
this
is
a
very
important
battle
to
win
from
the
standpoint
of
safety
number
one
and
defining
our
country
and
who
we
are
trump
told
reporters
at
the
white
house
before
leaving
for
a
short
trip
to
the
camp
david
presidential
retreat
the
barrier
or
the
wall
can
be
of
steel
instead
of
concrete
if
that
helps
people
it
may
be
better
he
said
the
white
house
painted
that
offer
which
trump
floated
previously
as
an
olive
branch
in
a
letter
to
congressional
leaders
on
sunday
detailing
its
funding
demands
the
trump
administration
included
a
request
for
an
additional
million
to
address
urgent
humanitarian
needs
at
the
southern
border
mick
mulvaney
trump
s
acting
chief
of
staff
told
nbc
s
meet
the
press
that
agreeing
to
a
steel
barrier
would
allow
democrats
to
stick
to
their
refusal
to
fund
a
wall
that
should
help
us
move
in
the
right
direction
he
said
house
majority
leader
steny
hoyer
did
not
show
his
hand
when
asked
whether
the
white
house
offer
to
move
away
from
a
concrete
structure
was
evidence
of
compromise
it
ll
be
discussed
he
said
on
nbc
vice
president
mike
pence
led
a
second
round
of
talks
with
congressional
aides
on
sunday
about
the
issue
but
trump
said
he
did
not
expect
those
talks
to
produce
results
noting
that
the
principals
himself
pelosi
and
senate
democratic
leader
chuck
schumer
were
the
ones
who
could
solve
it
quickly
if
we
don
t
find
a
solution
it
s
going
to
go
on
for
a
long
time
there
s
not
going
to
be
any
bend
right
here
trump
said
he
later
tweeted
that
the
pence
talks
were
productive
but
a
democratic
aide
familiar
with
the
meeting
said
democrats
urged
the
white
house
to
pass
measures
to
reopen
the
government
without
wall
funding
and
pence
said
trump
would
not
do
that
the
aide
said
no
progress
was
made
and
no
further
meetings
of
the
group
were
scheduled
democrats
could
demand
other
concessions
from
the
white
house
such
as
protections
for
immigrants
brought
illegally
to
the
united
states
as
children
known
as
dreamers
or
changes
to
other
spending
provisions
trump
said
he
wanted
to
help
on
the
dreamer
issue
but
preferred
to
wait
for
a
supreme
court
ruling
on
it
first
democratic
senator
dick
durbin
reacted
coolly
to
trump
s
suggestion
of
declaring
a
national
emergency
i
don
t
know
what
he
s
basing
this
on
but
he
s
faced
so
many
lawsuits
when
he
ignores
the
law
and
ignores
tradition
and
precedent
durbin
said
on
cbs
face
the
large
chunks
of
the
federal
government
were
shut
down
on
after
lawmakers
and
the
president
hit
an
impasse
over
trump
s
demand
that
a
bill
to
keep
the
federal
government
operational
include
money
to
help
build
a
billion
wall
along
the
border
with
mexico
about
government
workers
are
either
furloughed
or
working
without
pay
i
can
relate
trump
a
former
new
york
businessman
said
when
asked
if
he
could
relate
to
the
pain
of
federal
workers
struggling
to
pay
their
bills
i
m
sure
that
the
people
that
are
on
the
receiving
end
will
make
asked
if
workers
would
get
paid
on
friday
trump
said
we
ll
see
whether
or
not
it
s
not
all
republicans
agree
with
trump
s
insistence
on
keeping
government
agencies
shuttered
until
the
border
debate
is
resolved
it
is
not
a
sign
of
weakness
to
try
to
figure
out
a
middle
ground
and
i
think
that
both
sides
need
to
indicate
a
willingness
to
listen
and
to
compromise
senator
susan
collins
of
maine
said
on
nbc
she
called
the
debate
over
using
steel
versus
concrete
house
democrats
plan
to
pass
a
series
of
bills
this
week
to
reopen
government
breaking
up
legislation
they
have
already
approved
in
a
bid
to
get
republicans
to
agree
to
reopen
certain
agencies
hoyer
said
on
meet
the
we
need
to
open
up
government
and
then
negotiate
not
the
other
way
around
