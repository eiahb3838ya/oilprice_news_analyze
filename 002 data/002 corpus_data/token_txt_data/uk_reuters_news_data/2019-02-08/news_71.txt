washington
reuters
the
united
states
and
china
opened
a
pivotal
round
of
talks
on
wednesday
aimed
at
bridging
deep
differences
over
china
s
intellectual
property
and
technology
transfer
practices
and
easing
a
tariff
war
officials
led
by
chinese
vice
premier
liu
he
and
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
met
in
the
eisenhower
executive
office
building
next
to
the
white
house
with
only
a
month
left
to
reach
a
deal
before
a
march
deadline
to
increase
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
but
details
of
the
talks
were
scant
with
official
statements
seen
as
unlikely
before
they
conclude
on
thursday
a
ustr
spokeswoman
declined
comment
on
the
discussions
the
talks
began
with
an
awkward
silence
on
both
sides
of
a
long
negotiating
table
during
a
photo
opportunity
broken
when
lighthizer
made
joking
remarks
about
table
positioning
and
appearing
in
photographs
of
a
dinner
between
president
donald
trump
and
chinese
president
xi
jinping
in
december
it
was
at
that
meeting
in
buenos
aires
that
leaders
of
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
called
a
truce
to
try
to
work
out
trade
differences
through
negotiations
wednesday
s
meeting
was
the
gathering
since
then
liu
who
is
xi
s
top
economic
adviser
is
expected
to
meet
with
trump
on
thursday
seated
next
to
liu
was
people
s
bank
of
china
governor
yi
gang
a
official
has
advocated
further
opening
of
china
s
financial
services
markets
with
officials
from
the
finance
and
commerce
ministries
also
present
trump
s
top
trade
finance
and
economic
officials
flanked
lighthizer
on
the
side
including
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
and
white
house
advisers
larry
kudlow
and
peter
navarro
the
talks
began
two
days
after
the
united
states
charged
chinese
telecommunications
company
huawei
technologies
co
ltd
and
its
chief
financial
officer
meng
wanzhou
with
conspiring
to
violate
sanctions
on
iran
by
doing
business
through
a
subsidiary
it
tried
to
hide
meng
was
arrested
in
canada
on
at
the
request
of
the
united
states
which
is
seeking
to
have
her
extradited
mnuchin
and
ross
have
insisted
that
there
is
no
link
between
the
trade
talks
and
the
huawei
case
the
talks
in
washington
are
expected
to
be
tense
with
little
indication
so
far
that
chinese
officials
are
willing
to
address
core
demands
to
fully
protect
american
intellectual
property
rights
and
end
policies
that
washington
has
said
force
companies
to
transfer
technology
to
chinese
firms
the
complaints
along
with
accusations
of
chinese
cyber
theft
of
trade
secrets
and
a
systematic
campaign
to
acquire
technology
firms
were
used
by
the
trump
administration
to
justify
punitive
tariffs
on
billion
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
trump
has
threatened
to
raise
tariffs
on
billion
of
goods
to
percent
from
percent
on
march
if
an
agreement
can
not
be
reached
he
has
also
threatened
new
tariffs
on
the
remainder
of
chinese
goods
shipped
to
the
united
states
china
has
retaliated
with
tariffs
of
its
own
but
has
suspended
some
and
is
allowing
some
purchases
of
soybeans
during
the
talks
chinese
officials
deny
that
their
policies
coerce
technology
transfers
they
have
emphasized
steps
already
taken
including
reduced
automotive
tariffs
and
a
draft
foreign
investment
law
that
improves
access
for
foreign
firms
and
promises
to
outlaw
administrative
means
to
force
the
transfer
of
china
is
that
new
law
with
the
country
s
largely
parliament
likely
to
approve
it
in
march
a
crucial
component
of
any
progress
in
the
talks
according
to
top
trump
administration
officials
is
agreement
on
a
mechanism
to
verify
and
enforce
china
s
on
any
reform
pledges
that
it
makes
this
could
maintain
the
threat
of
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
for
the
long
term
federal
reserve
chairman
jerome
powell
asked
whether
anecdotal
evidence
of
tariff
effects
had
influenced
the
fed
s
decision
not
to
hike
interest
rates
on
wednesday
said
the
duties
so
far
have
not
had
a
material
effect
on
economic
output
the
concern
for
me
is
a
longer
set
of
negotiations
back
and
forth
could
result
in
sapping
business
confidence
powell
told
a
news
conference
uncertainty
is
not
the
friend
of
some
business
executives
expressed
hopes
for
progress
in
the
talks
including
boeing
chief
executive
dennis
muilenburg
aircraft
exports
have
thus
far
been
spared
from
retaliatory
chinese
tariffs
we
do
see
some
convergence
happening
we
think
both
countries
are
leaning
forward
and
we
anticipate
some
successful
conclusions
to
those
trade
talks
muilenburg
told
cnbc
a
breakthrough
deal
was
unlikely
this
week
as
both
sides
may
wait
to
reveal
their
best
offers
said
erin
ennis
senior
vice
president
of
the
business
council
i
don
t
think
there
s
going
to
be
any
big
outcome
ennis
said
of
the
talks
hopefully
they
make
some
good
progress
that
will
set
them
up
to
be
able
to
get
to
completion
at
the
end
of
the
but
the
chinese
side
would
likely
have
to
bring
to
the
table
a
new
offer
that
goes
significantly
beyond
its
previous
offers
to
significantly
increase
purchases
of
goods
including
soybeans
energy
and
manufactured
goods
