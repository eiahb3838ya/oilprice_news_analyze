kept
investors
on

digesting
a
positive
report
following
the
central
bank
s
latest
stress
test
of
seven
british
banks
and
building
societies
which
showed
they
could
withstand
a
disorderly
brexit
without
having
to
curb
lending
all
of
the
banks
passed
fairly
comfortably
in
the
most
extreme
scenarios
though
lloyds
was
perceived
to
be
the
most
vulnerable
due
to
its
high
uk
exposure
of
credit
card
loans
and
mortgages

analyst
at

were
up
percent
lloyds
and
rbs
were
both
percent
higher
mining
stocks
were
some
of
the
biggest
beneficiaries
of

was
up
percent
and
on

best
day

lifted
the

with
miner
antofagasta
up
percent
topping
the
ftse
investors
piled
into
building
materials
stocks
after
the
dovish
fed
comments
betting
that
rate
hikes
may
boost
the
flagging
housing
sector
the
sector
which
includes
crh
and
melrose
industries
was
up

their
best
day
since
april
ashtead
group
which
rents
equipment
such
as
diggers
and
construction
tools
got
an
extra
boost
rising
percent
after
news
its
ceo
geoff
drabble
will
step
down
next
year
most
of
the
action
was
on
the
mid

small
cap
indexes
with
intu
losing
more
than
a
third
of
its
market
cap
and
hitting
record
low
after
a
consortium
led
by
deputy

john
whittaker
abandoned
its
plan
to
buy
the
british
shopping
centre
group
the
news
sent
fresh
shivers
through
the
sector
dragging
its
rival
hammerson
percent
lower
elsewhere
earnings
boosted
soft
drinks
maker
britvic
and
pub
group
greene
king
which
were
up
percent
and
percent
respectively
if
greene
king
can
continue
to
manage
its
margins
and
maintain
decent
sales
then
investors
will
certainly
be
getting
the
rounds
in
when
the
results
are
announced

investors
in

services
provider
dignity
mourned
the
news
that
the
competition
and
markets
authority
cma
have
launched
a
probe
into
pricing
in
the
funeral
services
sector
after
it
found
problems
of
large
price
hikes
that
hit
people
at
their
most
vulnerable
shares
plunged
percent
to
their
lowest
since
june
peel
hunt
cut
its
rating
to
sell
from
hold
on
the
news
the
best
case
scenario
is
that
the
cma
just
ends
up
asking
for
greater
visibility
on
pricing
however
the
tone
of
the
statement
suggests
greater
remedies
will
be
required
