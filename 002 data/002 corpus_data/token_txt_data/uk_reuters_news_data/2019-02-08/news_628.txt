the
united
states
is
not
too
concerned
by
europe
s
idea
for
a
special
purpose
vehicle
spv
to
get
around
sanctions
with
iran
as
companies
are
already
withdrawing
from
the
country
in
droves
the
senior
official
for
financial
intelligence
said
i
think
the
bigger
news
in
europe
is
that
companies
are
withdrawing
from
iran
in
droves
under
secretary
of
the
treasury
sigal
mandelker
told
reporters
in
london
when
asked
about
the
spv
idea
i
am
not
concerned
by
the
spv
actually
at
all
she
said
i
do
believe
we
are
going
to
find
additional
mechanisms
by
which
we
can
work
the
restoration
of
sanctions
is
part
of
a
wider
effort
by
president
donald
trump
to
force
iran
to
curb
its
nuclear
and
missile
programs
as
well
as
its
support
for
proxy
forces
in
yemen
syria
lebanon
and
other
parts
of
the
middle
east
in
may
trump
exited
iran
s
nuclear
deal
with
six
powers
and
washington
reimposed
a
first
round
of
sanctions
on
iran
in
august
trump
s
moves
target
iran
s
main
source
of
revenue
its
oil
exports
as
well
as
its
financial
sector
essentially
making
iranian
banks
and
their
subsidiaries
off
limits
to
foreign
banks
on
pain
of
losing
access
to
the
financial
system
the
islamic
republic
opec
s
producer
called
the
moves
economic
warfare
said
they
would
hit
ordinary
iranians
and
vowed
defy
the
sanctions
to
sell
oil
to
the
world
voicing
opposition
to
policy
on
the
day
washington
announced
a
new
raft
of
sanctions
on
iran
the
european
union
earlier
this
month
said
it
was
setting
up
the
special
purpose
vehicle
i
have
do
doubt
that
we
will
be
able
to
find
common
ground
because
the
threats
are
real
and
the
threats
are
here
in
europe
mandelker
said
she
said
she
hoped
the
united
states
and
the
eu
could
take
joint
disruptive
action
against
iran
the
united
states
mandelker
said
would
strictly
enforce
its
sanctions
on
iran
when
asked
what
was
next
on
iran
she
said
on
iran
you
are
going
to
see
a
lot
more
from
swift
which
facilitates
the
bulk
of
global
payments
has
already
cut
off
the
iranian
central
bank
and
other
financial
institutions
mandelker
said
we
believe
swift
has
made
the
right
decision
to
disconnect
those
entities
mandelker
said
when
asked
if
that
included
the
iranian
central
bank
she
said
we
are
going
to
strictly
enforce
our
sanctions
and
that
s
a
message
we
are
sending
loud
and
clear
all
over
europe
to
the
private
sector
she
said
if
there
are
those
who
decide
not
to
abide
by
them
then
they
are
going
to
see
action
