macron's government wins no-confidence vote over bodyguard scandal
paris
reuters
the
french
government
on
tuesday
firmly
defeated
two
motions
put
forward
by
opposition
lawmakers
over
its
handling
of
a
scandal
involving
president
emmanuel
macron
s
bodyguard
confirming
his
solid
majority
although
the
two
motions
had
virtually
no
chance
of
succeeding
the
votes
capped
a
tumultuous
two
weeks
in
french
politics
after
a
video
showing
the
bodyguard
beating
protesters
triggered
the
most
serious
crisis
of
macron
s
tenure
the
motion
backed
by
the
conservative
opposition
party
won
votes
falling
short
of
the
necessary
to
topple
the
government
while
the
one
put
forward
by
an
alliance
of
parties
only
gathered
votes
macron
s
republic
on
the
move
party
controls
an
outright
majority
in
the
lower
house
national
assembly
and
not
a
single
of
the
president
s
mps
broke
ranks
on
tuesday
despite
the
parliamentary
victories
what
has
become
known
as
the
benalla
affair
after
bodyguard
alexandre
benalla
has
left
an
impact
on
macron
s
presidency
denting
his
popularity
and
throwing
parts
of
his
agenda
off
schedule
the
president
was
criticised
for
firing
the
aide
only
after
the
video
showing
him
assaulting
a
may
day
protester
while
wearing
police
gear
was
revealed
by
the
press
undermining
his
claim
of
building
an
exemplary
republic
as
well
as
forcing
his
government
to
postpone
a
constitutional
reform
the
affair
has
pushed
macron
down
in
the
polls
with
his
popularity
now
at
barely
percent
according
to
one
recent
survey
it
has
also
emboldened
a
fragmented
opposition
which
had
been
floundering
since
macron
s
landslide
victory
last
year
the
scandal
has
also
raised
questions
about
macron
s
highly
centralised
governing
style
and
the
wide
powers
conferred
on
the
president
under
france
s
fifth
republic
this
scandal
reveals
above
all
the
abuses
of
a
regime
veteran
communist
lawmaker
andre
chassaigne
told
mps
before
the
vote
this
is
not
just
a
summer
affair
it
shows
the
ultra
concentration
of
powers
by
an
elected
monarch
which
undermines
the
very
principle
of
separation
of
powers
he
said
the
former
investment
banker
has
dismissed
the
case
as
a
storm
in
a
teacup
although
macron
will
soon
head
off
to
the
south
of
france
for
a
summer
break
where
he
will
host
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
on
friday
the
scandal
will
continue
to
make
waves
when
lawmakers
return
in
september
the
senate
france
s
upper
house
of
parliament
has
set
up
an
enquiry
which
may
question
the
old
bodyguard
after
benalla
said
in
an
interview
he
was
open
to
it
despite
the
separate
judicial
investigation
opened
by
prosecutors
on
tuesday
the
head
of
macron
s
party
christophe
castaner
told
the
enquiry
he
had
fired
vincent
crase
the
second
man
who
was
seen
roughing
up
protesters
with
benalla
on
the
video
revealed
by
le
monde
newspaper
crase
who
held
a
security
position
in
the
president
s
party
was
also
placed
under
formal
investigation
by
prosecutors
