brussels
reuters
the
european
union
s
brexit
negotiators
believe
a
divorce
deal
with
britain
is
very
close
diplomatic
sources
said
in
a
sign
a
compromise
on
the
most
contentious
issue
the
future
irish
border
might
be
in
the
making
though
details
were
scarce
the
eu
signalled
on
thursday
it
was
engaging
with
new
proposals
emerging
in
britain
on
how
to
avoid
extensive
border
checks
between
britain
s
province
of
northern
ireland
and
eu
member
state
ireland
after
brexit
the
critical
potential
in
the
talks
to
end
four
decades
of
union
a
member
of
eu
brexit
negotiator
michel
barnier
s
team
told
a
briefing
with
national
diplomats
in
brussels
late
on
thursday
that
a
divorce
pact
with
britain
was
very
close
according
to
two
sources
present
we
are
going
in
the
right
direction
a
senior
eu
diplomat
said
separately
of
the
work
on
the
irish
fix
two
days
of
cautiously
positive
comments
from
brussels
have
helped
strengthen
sterling
but
britain
has
yet
to
formally
put
any
new
proposals
to
the
eu
in
writing
on
friday
evening
eu
brexit
negotiators
told
ambassadors
of
the
states
remaining
in
the
bloc
that
there
was
still
no
breakthrough
on
the
irish
issue
and
much
would
depend
on
what
their
british
counterparts
bring
to
brussels
next
week
the
two
sides
are
trying
to
push
the
divorce
deal
as
well
as
an
agreement
on
relations
over
the
line
in
time
for
leaders
summits
scheduled
for
and
under
the
plan
described
by
eu
sources
britain
would
give
up
on
insisting
on
only
a
emergency
irish
border
solution
britain
would
get
its
way
in
having
all
of
the
united
kingdom
rather
than
just
northern
ireland
stay
in
a
customs
union
with
the
bloc
if
the
backstop
is
triggered
irish
prime
minister
leo
varadkar
speaking
in
brussels
on
thursday
urged
britain
to
make
new
proposals
well
ahead
of
the
eu
summit
in
less
than
two
weeks
to
leave
enough
time
for
analysis
sources
in
brussels
say
the
devil
is
in
the
detail
negotiations
are
not
easy
because
we
also
have
to
be
critical
that
we
receive
different
signals
from
london
european
commission
head
juncker
said
in
austria
there
is
a
polyphonic
chorus
at
the
level
of
the
british
cabinet
and
we
try
to
arrange
the
pieces
so
that
they
become
a
melody
he
said
referring
to
divisions
within
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
government
over
the
terms
of
brexit
any
such
compromise
would
leave
the
eu
concerned
that
britain
could
use
northern
ireland
s
special
access
to
the
bloc
s
single
market
to
sell
cheaper
goods
that
would
not
adhere
to
eu
labour
environment
and
other
standards
the
bloc
worries
that
london
would
try
to
use
that
unique
trade
arrangement
as
a
building
block
for
the
overall
future
trade
relationship
and
win
an
unfair
competitive
edge
for
britain
the
problem
is
agreeing
to
checks
on
goods
and
livestock
with
northern
ireland
something
strongly
opposed
by
the
province
s
democratic
unionist
party
on
whose
votes
may
relies
to
govern
britain
s
brexit
ministry
said
on
friday
london
s
new
proposals
on
the
irish
border
would
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
united
kingdom
while
the
eu
is
pushing
london
on
the
irish
issue
the
states
remaining
in
the
bloc
are
also
fleshing
out
their
proposal
on
future
ties
with
britain
the
chairman
of
eu
leaders
donald
tusk
said
on
thursday
a
canada
plus
plus
plus
was
on
offer
meaning
an
advanced
free
trade
deal
coupled
with
close
security
ties
tight
cooperation
on
global
affairs
and
research
among
other
elements
another
senior
eu
diplomat
said
the
eu
would
propose
zero
tariffs
and
zero
quotas
in
trade
with
britain
after
brexit
which
would
go
beyond
what
the
bloc
has
with
canada
such
a
proposal
goes
down
well
with
may
s
critics
at
home
who
advocate
a
more
uncompromising
split
with
the
eu
than
she
is
seeking
but
for
the
eu
an
irish
backstop
would
be
an
essential
part
of
any
such
offer
which
in
turn
is
not
to
the
liking
of
brexiteers
who
do
not
want
britain
s
means
to
forge
independent
trade
deals
limited
by
staying
in
a
customs
union
any
deal
between
may
and
fellow
eu
leaders
must
be
endorsed
by
both
the
eu
and
british
parliaments
another
hurdle
to
clear
to
avoid
the
most
damaging
scenario
of
britain
leaving
the
bloc
with
little
in
place
to
mitigate
the
economic
shock
time
is
pressing
all
partners
know
that
a
german
government
spokesman
said
britain
exiting
without
an
agreement
would
not
be
in
the
interests
of
britain
