auction battle looms for comcast and fox as sky bidding deadline nears
london
reuters
britain
s
takeover
regulator
could
take
the
rare
step
of
intervening
in
the
battle
between
comcast
and
century
fox
for
sky
next
month
by
staging
an
auction
for
the
broadcaster
to
bring
the
bidding
war
to
an
end
the
takeover
panel
has
the
power
to
instigate
a
formal
auction
process
for
sky
to
help
resolve
its
future
if
two
competing
bids
that
have
not
been
declared
final
remain
on
the
table
for
the
company
on
according
to
britain
s
takeover
code
there
have
only
been
three
british
takeover
situations
since
that
have
involved
auctions
handled
by
the
regulator
including
the
billion
sale
of
steelmaker
corus
to
india
s
tata
steel
according
to
analysis
by
reuters
a
fourth
battle
ended
just
before
an
auction
was
due
to
start
when
royal
dutch
shell
abandoned
its
takeover
attempt
of
gas
explorer
cove
energy
in
allowing
thailand
s
ptt
exploration
production
to
clinch
a
billion
deal
that
marked
the
last
time
the
panel
invoked
the
auction
procedure
cable
giant
comcast
currently
leads
rupert
murdoch
s
fox
in
the
fight
for
sky
with
a
pound
a
share
offer
last
month
that
values
the
broadcaster
at
billion
pounds
and
has
been
recommended
by
the
group
s
independent
directors
that
trumped
the
pound
a
share
offer
made
by
fox
earlier
in
july
for
the
percent
of
sky
it
does
not
already
own
and
is
percent
above
fox
s
original
pound
a
share
bid
sky
s
shares
currently
trade
at
pounds
under
the
current
timetable
for
a
deal
which
can
be
changed
by
the
panel
fox
and
comcast
are
free
to
lift
their
bids
at
any
point
up
until
the
deadline
if
neither
suitor
has
admitted
defeat
by
then
the
regulator
can
step
in
and
start
an
auction
the
panel
did
not
comment
the
aim
of
an
auction
is
to
bring
a
protracted
bidding
war
to
a
close
by
giving
the
suitors
an
opportunity
to
submit
revised
offers
in
an
orderly
process
managed
by
the
panel
which
remains
neutral
but
it
can
also
serve
to
drive
up
the
price
that
the
successful
suitor
ultimately
pays
i
hope
it
goes
to
an
auction
said
crispin
odey
whose
eponymous
hedge
fund
is
a
shareholder
in
sky
every
day
i
look
at
that
price
and
think
why
is
it
not
at
pounds
in
there
were
concerns
that
tata
overpaid
for
corus
after
it
became
embroiled
in
a
lengthy
fight
for
the
steelmaker
with
brazilian
firm
companhia
siderurgica
nacional
the
panel
eventually
stepped
in
and
ran
an
auction
that
went
for
nine
rounds
over
the
course
of
about
eight
hours
and
finished
in
the
early
hours
of
a
wednesday
morning
tata
emerged
the
winner
with
a
pence
a
share
offer
a
third
higher
than
its
original
pence
bid
tata
s
expensive
foray
into
british
steelmaking
later
proved
problematic
for
the
indian
group
after
overcapacity
in
europe
plunged
the
uk
s
steel
industry
into
crisis
in
it
subsequently
agreed
a
deal
to
create
a
european
steel
joint
venture
with
germany
s
thyssenkrupp
earlier
this
year
to
help
their
operations
withstand
the
pressures
facing
the
industry
since
the
corus
sale
the
panel
has
tweaked
the
rules
governing
auctions
so
that
unless
the
bidders
and
target
agree
an
alternative
procedure
the
regulator
runs
a
process
over
five
consecutive
business
days
the
suitors
can
announce
revised
offers
by
each
day
up
until
the
fifth
day
after
which
no
new
bids
are
allowed
and
the
offers
become
final
the
auction
ends
earlier
than
the
fifth
day
if
there
is
a
round
that
draws
no
new
offers
the
sky
battle
is
one
part
of
a
much
broader
consolidation
sweeping
the
entertainment
industry
as
the
growth
of
netflix
and
amazon
force
the
world
s
traditional
media
giants
to
spend
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
to
keep
pace
fox
s
existing
percent
shareholding
in
sky
is
part
of
a
host
of
tv
and
film
assets
that
murdoch
s
group
has
agreed
to
sell
to
walt
disney
for
about
billion
comcast
was
also
vying
to
buy
those
fox
assets
until
it
dropped
out
of
that
battle
in
july
to
focus
on
taking
control
of
sky
pounds
