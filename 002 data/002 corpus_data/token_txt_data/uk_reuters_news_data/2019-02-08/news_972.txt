new

reuters
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
was
reminded
of
how
worried
businesses
are
about
brexit
on
wednesday
when
a
rallying
speech
to
executives
in
new
york
was
met
with
a
single
stark
question
from
the
floor
just
how
bad
can
things
get
may
assured
her
audience
that
britain
would
flourish
after
brexit
and
remain
an
attractive
place
to
invest
seeking
to
ease
concerns
about
the
country
s
future
after
it
leaves
the
european
union
next
march
she
said
she
was
confident
that
britain
would
be
able
to
achieve
a
good
deal
with
the
eu
over
its
future
trading
relationship
but
in
a
question
and
answer
session
following
her
speech
stephen
schwarzman
chief
executive
of
private
equity
firm
blackstone
group
asked
may
to
confront
the
downside
risks
to
britain
s
eu
exit
i
guess
we
are
believers
said
schwarzman
whose
firm
was
part
of
a
joint
venture
that
agreed
to
buy
up
the
commercial
property
portfolio
of
britain
s
rail
network
owner
for
billion
but
on
the
other
side
things
could
really
go
off
with
a
bad
brexit
and
ultimately
a
change
of
government
what
we
really
worry
about
is
how
bad
things
can
get
in
response
may
said
i
absolutely
appreciate
and
understand
from
that
you
re
making
decisions
and
looking
ahead
to
what
the
future
holds
and
at
the
moment
there
is
that
uncertainty
about
what
the
future
will
hold
in
terms
of
she
pledged
britain
would
make
a
success
of
brexit
whatever
the
outcome
of
negotiations
earlier
ibm
boss
ginni
rometty
asked
may
on
stage
how
she
suggested
businesses
should
manage
the
risks
of
brexit
if
you
were
us
what
would
you
do
in
our
shoes
to
be
planning
right
now
what
would
you
do
now
to
balance
that
risk
may
s
brexit
proposals
were
savaged
by
eu
leaders
at
a
summit
last
week
and
many
in
her
own
party
have
criticised
her
approach
raising
prospects
that
she
will
fail
to
strike
any
agreement
and
that
britain
could
leave
without
a
deal
something
business
leaders
fear
would
be
hugely
damaging
we
re
at
the
point
of
the
negotiations
where
we
ve
got
a
few
weeks
to
go
may
said
we
don
t
know
where
the
negotiations
will
end
i
m
confident
about
getting
a
deal
but
we
have
to
make
sure
we
re
prepared
for
any
in
her
speech
may
said
she
would
not
abandon
her
current
brexit
plan
shrugging
off
criticism
at
home
and
in
brussels
she
said
her
proposal
to
keep
a
close
trading
relationship
with
the
eu
on
goods
protect
manufacturing
jobs
and
resolve
arguments
over
the
borders
of
northern
ireland
while
ending
unrestricted
immigration
from
the
eu
was
the
only
way
forward
however
with
many
of
her
own
lawmakers
and
the
opposition
labour
party
saying
they
will
vote
against
such
a
deal
in
parliament
there
are
major
doubts
over
the
final
outcome
of
negotiations
and
may
s
long
term
future
as
leader
in
her
speech
may
promised
that
businesses
investing
in
britain
would
get
the
lowest
rate
of
corporation
tax
among
the
group
of
leading
economies
with
access
to
service
industries
and
a
financial
centre
in
london
that
are
the
envy
of
the
world
she
pledged
to
deliver
an
economy
that
is
highly
innovative
highly
skilled
and
high
quality
but
with
low
tax
and
smart
regulation
and
said
a
new
immigration
system
would
allow
businesses
to
attract
the
brightest
and
best
