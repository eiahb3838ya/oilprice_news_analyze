ambassador
to
the

nikki
haley
warned
russia
on
monday
that
its
seizure

three
ukrainian
vessels
was
an
outrageous
violation
of
sovereign
ukrainian
territory
and
urged
moscow
to
reduce
tensions
caused
by
its
arrogant
act
haley
said
she
had
spoken
with
president
donald
trump
and
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
earlier
on
monday
and
that
her
statement
reflects
the
concerns
at
the
highest
as
president
trump
has
said
many
times
the
united
states
would
welcome
a
normal
relationship
with
russia
but
outlaw
actions
like
this
one
continue
to
make
that
impossible
said
haley
a
member
of
trump
s
cabinet
russia
seized
two
small
ukrainian
armoured
artillery
vessels
and
a
tug
boat
which
moscow
said
had
illegally
entered
russia
s
territorial
waters
kiev
said
its
vessels
did
nothing
wrong
and
has
accused
russia
of
military
aggression
the
united
states
will
maintain
its
sanctions
against
russia
further
russian
escalation
of
this
kind
will
only
make
matters
worse
it
will
further
undermine
russia
s
standing
in
the
world
it
will
further
sour
russia
s
relations
with
the
and
many
other
countries
haley
said
ukrainian
ambassador
volodymyr
yelchenko
called
on
the
international
community
to
implement
a
new
set
of
sanctions
aimed
at
addressing
the
situation
in
the
region
including
against
russia
s
azov
he
told
the
council
that
increased
political
pressure
on
moscow
would
help
the
situation
but
also
warned
that
ukraine
was
ready
to
use
all
available
means
in
exercising
our
right
to
russian
deputy
ambassador
dmitry
polyanskiy
accused
ukraine
of
planning
the
incident
and
suggested
it
was
because
president
petro
poroshenko
s
popularity
among
voters
was
low
ahead
of
an
election
next
year
how
can
he
maintain
power
in
these
circumstances
it
s
clear
organise
provocation
and
once
again
accuse
russia
of
everything
inflate
his
own
ratings
and
put
himself
forward
as
the
saviour
of
the
nation
polyanskiy
told
the
council
this
is
about
cancelling
the
elections
despite
all
of
poroshenko
s
assurances
to
the
contrary
he
said
warning
that
russia
has
never
caused
the
first
blow
but
it
knows
how
to
protect
yelchenko
rejected
polyanskiy
s
remarks
about
motives
he
told
the
council
the
incident
was
a
clear
threat
to
international
peace
and
security
and
that
russia
was
mixing
reality
with
fiction
in
trying
to
explain
what
happened
political
affairs
chief
rosemary
dicarlo
told
the
security
council
the
united
nations
could
not
independently
verify
what
had
happened
we
strongly
urge
both
the
russian
federation
and
ukraine
to
refrain
from
any
ratcheting
up
of
actions
or
rhetoric
and
remind
both
of
the
need
to
contain
this
incident
so
as
to
prevent
a
serious
escalation
she
said
the
security
council
has
met
dozens
of
times
over
the
crisis
in
ukraine
since
russia
annexed
crimea
in
it
is
unable
to
take
any
action
as
russia
is
one
of
the
council
s
five
veto
powers
the
ukrainian
vessels
seized
by
russia
on
sunday
had
been
trying
to
enter
the
sea
of
azov
from
the
black
sea
via
the
narrow
kerch
strait
that
separates
crimea
