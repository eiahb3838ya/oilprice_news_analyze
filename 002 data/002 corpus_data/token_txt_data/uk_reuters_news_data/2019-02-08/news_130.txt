south
korea
s
pet
industry
is
booming
fueled
by
the
same
factors
that
have
made
the
country
s
birth
rate
at
births
per
woman
the
lowest
in
the
world
the
high
cost
of
education
and
housing
as
well
as
extremely
long
working
days
social
pressures
in
south
korea
are
such
that
parents
are
required
to
provide
resources
for

from
private
schooling
to
tutoring
to
art
classes
said

rica
the

growing
as
more

or
even
not
to
