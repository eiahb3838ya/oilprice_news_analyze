after brexit vote delay, leadership challenge looms for may
reuters
an
attempt
to
oust
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
gathered
pace
on
tuesday
a
day
after
her
decision
to
delay
a
vote
in
parliament
on
her
brexit
deal
for
fear
of
a
rout
angered
many
in
her
conservative
party
with
may
on
a
tour
of
european
capitals
to
try
to
secure
reassurances
to
calm
the
crisis
at
home
the
bbc
and
other
media
cited
sources
as
saying
the
required
number
of
letters
from
conservative
lawmakers
calling
for
a
vote
in
her
leadership
of
the
party
had
been
met
only
one
member
of
the
party
knows
how
many
lawmakers
have
submitted
their
letters
but
her
position
looked
more
precarious
than
ever
with
less
than
four
months
left
until
the
united
kingdom
is
due
to
leave
the
eu
on
march
may
s
premiership
and
her
deal
to
stave
off
a
disorderly
departure
or
a
bid
to
stop
brexit
are
hanging
by
a
thread
if
she
is
toppled
and
it
is
far
from
certain
that
she
would
lose
a
vote
among
all
the
party
s
members
of
parliament
could
further
complicate
brexit
the
bbc
cited
multiple
sources
as
saying
the
required
letters
had
been
reached
the
chairman
of
the
party
s
committee
of
backbench
lawmakers
graham
brady
asked
to
see
may
on

enforcer

her
downing
street
residence
on
tuesday
night
lawmaker
andrew
bridgen
a
critic
of
may
said
he
believed
conservative
members
of
parliament
would
vote
on
her
leadership
at
the
first
opportunity
which
could
be
on
wednesday
night
may
s
postponement
of
the
vote
on
her
deal
to
maintain
close
ties
with
the
eu
after
leaving
in
march
infuriated
lawmakers
on
all
sides
of
the
debate
from
hardline
brexit
supporters
to
those
who
want
to
remain
in
the
eu
acknowledging
that
she
faced
significant
losses
if
she
asked
parliament
to
vote
on
tuesday
may
had
said
she
would
try
to
ease
lawmakers
concerns
particularly
over
the
northern
irish
backstop
that
took
her
on
a
tour
of
eu
capitals
on
tuesday
but
there
little
sign
that
she
might
be
able
to
do
away
with
the
backstop
a
guarantee
that
there
will
be
no
return
to
a
hard
border
between
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
and
eu
member
ireland
after
brexit
her
former
brexit
minister
david
davis
wrote
in
the
telegraph
newspaper
that
the
prime
minister
s
latest
ploy
of
looking
for
more
fudge
with
which
to
buy
off
the
house
of
commons
will
not
work
he
instead
urged
a
change
of
strategy
rip
up
her
deal
and
pursue
a
free
trade
deal
similar
to
one
that
the
eu
has
with
canada
so
now
is
the
moment
to
seize
control
and
deliver
our
own
destiny
he
wrote
we
are
crying
out
for
leadership
and
direction
kicking
the
can
down
the
road
is
not
a
strategy
it
s
a
delaying
the
message
from
the
eu
was
also
clear
it
could
give
assurances
about
how
it
interprets
the
exit
treaty
but
would
not
countenance
reopening
the
text
itself
donald
tusk
who
will
chair
an
eu
summit
in
brussels
on
thursday
and
friday
tweeted
after
talking
to
may
clear
that
eu
wants
to
help
the
question
is
two
sources
said
merkel
had
told
her
own
german
conservative
parliamentary
group
there
would
be
no
more
negotiations
but
efforts
were
being
made
to
give
britain
reassurances
may
told
merkel
that
it
was
in
nobody
s
interest
for
britain
to
leave
with
no
accord
the
sources
said
european
commission
head
juncker
said
the
deal
we
achieved
is
the
best
possible
it
s
the
only
deal
possible
there
is
no
room
whatsoever
for
renegotiation
but
of
course
there
is
room
enough
to
give
further
clarifications
and
further
interpretations
without
opening
the
withdrawal
may
s
team
has
continued
working
to
try
to
get
the
vote
through
with
her
ministers
telling
parliament
that
it
will
get
its
vote
before
the
pound
which
has
lost
cents
against
the
dollar
since
the
referendum
fell
again
amid
the
reports
that
may
would
face
a
leadership
challenge
the
biggest
obstacle
to
approval
remains
the
irish
backstop
may
s
critics
say
it
could
leave
britain
subject
to
eu
rules
indefinitely
the
eu
has
said
neither
side
wants
the
backstop
to
take
effect
but
it
has
to
be
part
of
the
deal
just
in
case
with
little
hope
of
scrapping
it
the
options
open
to
britain
range
from
a
chaotic
brexit
to
risking
the
wrath
of
brexit
backers
by
calling
the
whole
thing
off
both
may
s
conservatives
and
the
main
opposition
labour
party
have
pledged
to
implement
the
result
of
the
referendum
in
which
britons
voted
narrowly
to
leave
the
eu
but
more
and
more
backbench
lawmakers
along
with
three
of
four
living
say
the
only
option
may
be
a
new
referendum
with
an
option
to
stay
the
eu
s
top
court
ruled
this
week
that
britain
could
abandon
brexit
with
no
consequences
up
until
the
moment
it
finally
leaves
former
prime
minister
john
major
who
also
faced
a
conservative
revolt
over
europe
in
the
said
britain
must
revoke
its
divorce
notice
immediately
it
s
clear
we
now
need
the
most
precious
commodity
of
all
time
time
for
serious
and
profound
reflection
by
both
parliament
