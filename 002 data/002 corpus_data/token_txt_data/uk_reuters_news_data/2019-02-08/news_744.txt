vatican
city
reuters
a
major
meeting
of
catholic
bishops
ended
on
saturday
with
a
call
for
women
to
play
a
greater
role
in
church
decision
making
as
a
duty
of
justice
but
appeared
to
water
down
language
that
would
have
been
more
welcoming
to
gays
the
role
of
women
took
centre
stage
at
the
synod
which
was
focussed
on
reaching
out
to
young
people
but
has
been
overshadowed
by
the
scandal
over
sex
abuse
in
the
church
and
acrimony
between
social
conservatives
and
reformers
in
a
sign
of
the
divisions
the
synod
used
what
appeared
to
be
compromise
language
on
the
topic
of
homosexuality
saying
people
could
not
be
identified
solely
by
sexual
orientation
a
working
paper
for
the
gathering
which
began
on
had
used
the
acronym
lgbt
but
this
did
not
appear
in
the
final
document
the
document
also
called
for
stricter
measures
to
combat
sexual
abuse
including
more
transparency
in
church
structures
and
denounced
a
culture
of
elitism
among
some
church
leaders
which
it
said
can
facilitate
and
corruption
all
three
issues
were
among
the
subjects
debated
at
the
gathering
officially
titled
young
people
faith
and
discernment
of
vocation
and
attended
by
some
bishops
priests
nuns
and
lay
participants
only
synod
fathers
including
bishops
and
some
other
male
representatives
were
allowed
to
vote
on
the
final
document
it
will
be
sent
to
the
pope
who
will
take
it
into
consideration
when
he
writes
his
own
document
attention
was
drawn
to
the
issue
of
women
s
rights
by
the
synod
s
own
rules
under
which
two
monks
who
lead
religious
orders
were
permitted
to
vote
while
a
nun
with
a
similar
role
was
not
the
catholic
church
restricts
the
priesthood
to
men
but
allows
people
of
both
sexes
who
are
not
priests
to
hold
positions
of
authority
in
other
areas
however
none
of
the
vatican
s
departments
is
headed
by
a
women
and
only
six
women
hold
decision
making
roles
in
the
vatican
bureaucracy
young
people
the
document
said
believed
the
church
still
lagged
in
attempts
to
give
women
space
in
decision
making
processes
in
jobs
not
restricted
to
priests
the
synod
recommends
making
everyone
in
the
church
aware
of
the
urgency
of
an
unavoidable
change
the
document
says
it
called
for
a
female
presence
in
church
roles
at
all
levels
even
in
positions
of
responsibility
which
it
described
as
a
duty
of
justice
the
three
sections
on
sexuality
in
the
document
were
not
as
strong
or
as
inclusive
as
some
young
people
had
wanted
although
it
renewed
the
church
s
commitment
against
all
discrimination
and
violence
the
acronym
lgbt
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
a
vatican
document
in
the
working
paper
for
synod
issued
in
may
that
working
paper
said
some
lgbt
youths
wish
to
benefit
from
greater
closeness
and
experience
greater
care
by
the
but
conservative
bishops
including
those
from
africa
and
at
least
one
from
the
united
states
opposed
the
mention
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
lgbtq
catholic
or
a
transgender
catholic
or
a
heterosexual
catholic
as
if
our
sexual
appetites
defined
who
we
are
philadelphia
archbishop
charles
chaput
said
in
his
address
to
the
synod
the
church
teaches
that
having
homosexual
urges
is
not
sinful
but
people
must
not
act
on
them
in
its
sections
on
sexual
abuse
scandals
that
have
scarred
the
church
in
a
number
of
countries
the
document
called
for
strong
preventive
measures
to
prevent
any
repeat
and
supported
calls
for
a
stricter
selection
of
men
who
want
to
be
priests
