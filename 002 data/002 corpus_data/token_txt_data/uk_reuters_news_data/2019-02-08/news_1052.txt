a
volunteer
medic
and
the
man
whose
life
he
saved
a
lawmaker
whose
facebook
post
calling
for
protests
in
kiev
s
maidan
square
helped
bring
down
a
president
these
are
some
of
the
characters
featured
in
a
virtual
reality
reconstruction
of
the
bloodiest
day
in
the
street
demonstrations
in
ukraine
when
dozens
of
protesters
were
killed
in
the
final
moments
of
viktor
yanukovich
s
rule
ahead
of
the
fifth
anniversary
of
the
protests
a
group
of
fourteen
journalists
designers
and
it
engineers
developed
a
programme
allowing
the
user
to
walk
through
the
area
around
maidan
square
videos
of
people
who
were
there
on
february
the
bloodiest
day
of
violence
pop
up
to
relate
their
experiences
and
explain
the
significance
of
particular
spots
a
transparent
blue
wall
marks
where
yanukovich
s
forces
lined
up
to
repel
the
protesters
for
alexey
furman
of
new
cave
media
who
covered
the
protests
as
a
photojournalist
the
experience
of
recreating
the
event
was
cathartic
for
me
especially
it
was
a
very
traumatic
morning
as
it
was
for
hundreds
of
other
people
he
said
i
saw
people
getting
i
think
the
project
actually
helped
fight
the
ptsd
that
i
had
because
i
d
been
on
maidan
dozens
of
times
in
and
he
said
in
an
interview
referring
to
stress
disorder
he
used
to
avoid
instytutska
street
which
runs
on
a
hill
down
to
maidan
and
was
the
scene
of
much
of
the
bloodshed
because
of
the
painful
memories
but
now
to
be
honest
i
come
to
instytutska
and
go
like
oh
we
still
don
t
have
that
we
have
to
work
on
the
team
says
it
took
around
images
to
build
the
virtual
reality
model
a
project
which
was
with
a
grant
from
google
labs
more
than
people
were
killed
during
the
protests
who
came
to
be
known
locally
as
the
heavenly
hundred
a
small
strip
of
instytutska
was
subsequently
renamed
after
them
from
exile
in
russia
yanukovich
has
denied
ukrainians
widespread
belief
that
he
ordered
his
special
forces
to
open
fire
at
the
end
of
the
experience
the
user
meets
two
people
whom
fate
threw
together
on
february
a
wounded
protester
and
a
medical
volunteer
who
held
his
hand
over
the
wound
for
a
good
twenty
minutes
maybe
even
more
said
of
new
cave
media
sergiy
polezhaka
in
an
interview
hiding
in
a
tiny
place
under
the
tree
waiting
for
danger
to
calm
down
a
little
bit
to
save
this
protester
s
life
this
is
the
iconic
image
from
that
morning
for
the
user
will
also
meet
the
journalist
turned
mp
mustafa
nayyem
whose
facebook
post
in
november
calling
for
demonstrations
against
yanukovich
s
decision
to
pull
out
of
a
deal
with
the
european
union
triggered
the
maidan
revolt
the
protests
in
turn
lit
the
fuse
for
russia
seizing
and
annexing
crimea
in
march
and
the
outbreak
of
separatist
fighting
in
the
donbass
region
that
has
killed
more
than
despite
a
notional
ceasefire
