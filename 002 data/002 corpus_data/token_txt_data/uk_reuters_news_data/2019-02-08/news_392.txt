macron's concessions set to blow out french deficit
paris
reuters
france
will
overshoot
the
european
union
s
budget
deficit
ceiling
next
year
without
deeper
spending
cuts
after
president
emmanuel
macron
caved
in
to
protests
macron
announced
wage
increases
for
the
poorest
workers
and
a
tax
cut
for
most
pensioners
on
monday
in
an
effort
to
quell
a
near
public
revolt
but
the
measures
will
leave
a
billion
euro
billion
pounds
hole
in
the
treasury
s
finances
pushing
france
back
over
the
eu
deficit
limit
of
percent
of
national
output
and
dealing
a
blow
to
macron
s
reformist
credentials
we
are
preparing
a
fiscal
boost
for
workers
by
accelerating
tax
cuts

not
give
details
on
the
impact
of
the
concessions
on

or
possible

saying
only
that
the
government
aimed
to
keep

societe

economist
michel
martinez
wrote
in
a
research
note
any
failure
to
respect
the
eu
deficit
ceiling
could
shatter
france
s
fiscal
credibility
with
its
european
partners
after
paris
flouted
it
for
a
decade
before
macron
took
office
and
any
sign
of
leniency
from
brussels
could
complicate
the
european
commission
s
tense
discussions
with
italy
about
keeping
its
deficit
down
italian
deputy
prime
minister
luigi
di
maio
said
paris
should
be
subject
to
the
same
treatment
as
rome
and
now
risked
eu
censure
over
its
budget
concessions
if
the
rules
are
valid
for
italy
then
i
expect
them
to
be
valid
for
macron
di
maio
said
france
s
borrowing
costs
climbed
to
their
highest
level
compared
with
germany

europe

credit
rating
agency
said
it
was
unlikely
macron
would
be
able
to
push
through
reforms
of
france
s
costly
pension
and
healthcare
systems
if
he
continued
to
lose
public
support
budget
minister
gerald
darmanin
said
macron
s
concessions
would
amount
to
billion
euros
including
the
cancelling
of
energy
tax
hikes
announced
last
week
darmanin
told
senators
the
government
now
expected
a
budget
deficit
of
percent
of
gdp
in
excluding
the
impact
of
a
payroll
tax
rebate
scheme
becoming
a
permanent
tax
cut
at
a
cost
of
billion
euros
that
compares
with
a
previous
forecast
of
percent
without
or
percent
overall
the
new
higher
underlying
deficit
thus
implies
pushing
the
overall
number
towards
percent
next
year
without
measures
to
rein
in
spending
moreover
the
yellow
vest
protests
are
slowing
economic
growth
two
opinion
polls
on
tuesday
showed
roughly
one
in
two
french
people
think
they
should
now
end
their
protests
an
elysee
official
said
on
monday
france
had
some
wiggle
room
on
spending
if
the
tax
rebate
was
not
taken
into
account
the
european
union
s
executive
arm
is
to
make
a
final
assessment
of
france
s
budget
in
the
second
quarter
of
next
year
when
it
releases
new
economic
forecasts
