president
donald
trump
s
verbal
attacks
on
the
media
run
the
risk
of
triggering
real
violence
against
journalists
the
rapporteur
for
freedom
of
expression
said
on
thursday
in
a
joint
statement
with
edison
lanza
who
holds
the
same
post
at
the
commission
on
human
rights
david
kaye
said
trump
s
tirades
against
the
media
violated
the
basic
norms
of
press
freedom
these
attacks
run
counter
to
the
country
s
obligations
to
respect
press
freedom
and
international
human
rights
law
they
said
we
are
especially
concerned
that
these
attacks
increase
the
risk
of
journalists
being
targeted
with
trump
frequently
brands
stories
and
outlets
he
dislikes
as
fake
news
last
week
cnn
said
one
of
its
white
house
correspondents
was
excluded
from
a
trump
event
prompting
a
complaint
from
the
white
house
correspondents
association
the
freedom
of
expression
experts
said
trump
s
attacks
on
the
press
were
designed
to
raise
doubts
about
verifiable
facts
and
that
he
and
his
administration
had
sought
to
undermine
reporting
on
potential
illegal
conduct
but
he
has
failed
to
show
even
once
that
specific
reporting
has
been
driven
by
any
untoward
motivations
kaye
and
lanza
said
they
also
urged
the
administration
to
stop
suing
journalists
to
discover
their
sources
and
to
stop
using
the
espionage
act
to
pursue
there
have
been
at
least
two
prosecutions
of
people
leaking
to
journalists
under
that
