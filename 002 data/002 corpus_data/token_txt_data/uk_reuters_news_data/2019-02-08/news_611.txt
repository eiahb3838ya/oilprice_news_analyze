eu-uk brexit deal sees july 2020 decision on keeping irish border open - eu sources
brussels
reuters
the
draft
accord
reached
between
the
eu
and
britain
envisages
a
july
decision
on
what
would
have
to
be
done
to
safeguard
an
open
irish
border
after
the
transition
runs
its
course
and
if
a
new
trade
deal
is
not
in
place
eu
sources
said
britain
would
then
have
two
choices
one
would
be
extending
the
transition
period
once
beyond
december
possibly
until
the
end
of
the
other
would
be
going
into
a
customs
arrangement
that
would
cover
all
of
the
united
kingdom
but
in
which
its
province
of
northern
ireland
would
be
aligned
more
closely
with
the
eu
s
customs
rules
and
production
standards
three
diplomatic
sources
said
in
brussels
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
was
trying
to
convince
her
cabinet
on
wednesday
to
accept
the
draft
eu
divorce
deal
which
her
opponents
say
threatens
both
her
government
and
the
unity
of
the
united
kingdom
under
world
trade
organisation
rules
however
northern
ireland
and
the
rest
of
britain
would
remain
part
of
the
same
customs
area
under
the
draft
deal
eu
sources
stressed
an
effort
to
appease
may
s
northern
irish
unionist
allies
who
prop
up
her
minority
government
in
london
the
eu
sources
said
the
customs
arrangement
option
included
clauses
to
ensure
a
level
playing
field
by
stipulating
the
uk
would
have
to
align
itself
with
eu
rules
on
state
aid
and
competition
environment
and
labour
standards
anathema
to
hardline
brexiteers
in
her
divided
conservative
party
for
the
eu
this
measure
is
crucial
as
otherwise
it
fears
britain
could
gain
open
access
to
the
bloc
s
cherished
single
market
with
no
tariffs
or
quotas
and
without
needing
to
observe
the
same
standards
this
could
lead
to
british
goods
in
the
eu
being
offered
at
prices
undercutting
the
bloc
s
own
producers
france
is
spearheading
a
group
of
eu
countries
in
demanding
guarantees
to
prevent
any
such
outcome
the
sources
said
northern
ireland
would
remain
inside
the
eu
customs
union
the
sources
said
as
an
emergency
fix
to
keep
the
irish
border
open
if
a
separate
deal
on
future
trade
relations
with
the
eu
has
not
been
reached
by
the
end
of
the
transition
period
they
said
ways
for
britain
to
exit
the
customs
arrangement
were
still
not
finalised
and
would
require
more
negotiations
the
eu
wants
any
such
exit
to
be
approved
jointly
through
a
common
arbitration
mechanism
the
joint
committee
under
the
preferred
eu
option
should
the
two
sides
be
unable
to
agree
they
would
seek
guidance
from
the
bloc
s
top
court
the
european
court
of
justice
ecj
but
may
s
government
wants
to
be
able
to
walk
away
unilaterally
powerful
brexiteers
in
her
party
vow
to
reject
any
deal
that
would
keep
britain
in
an
eu
customs
zone
indefinitely
hampering
its
freedom
to
pursue
independent
trade
deals
ending
the
jurisdiction
of
the
ecj
in
britain
was
also
a
central
promise
of
the
leave
campaign
that
narrowly
won
britain
s
referendum
on
eu
membership
the
british
side
has
not
yet
shared
any
details
of
the
deal
another
open
issue
is
fisheries
according
to
the
sources
the
eu
wants
to
maintain
the
current
mutual
access
to
fishing
waters
which
often
means
eu
countries
and
companies
fishing
in
uk
waters
london
wants
to
take
full
control
of
its
fisheries
france
belgium
the
netherlands
and
denmark
were
among
those
eu
states
pushing
for
firm
guarantees
of
access
to
uk
waters
the
three
sources
however
said
that
this
issue
was
left
outside
the
customs
arrangement
in
the
draft
brexit
deal
the
two
sides
would
only
agree
to
work
this
out
by
july
they
added
all
in
all
eu
sources
have
said
they
felt
like
the
bloc
has
given
quite
some
ground
to
uk
demands
in
the
negotiation
though
that
would
not
be
the
way
may
s
critics
see
it
may
s
cabinet
will
convene
on
wednesday
at
the
same
time
as
national
envoys
of
eu
member
states
in
brussels
they
will
look
at
the
proposed
deal
and
wait
to
see
if
the
british
cabinet
has
approved
it
should
that
happen
the
eu
s
national
ministers
for
european
affairs
would
meet
in
brussels
on
monday
to
start
preparing
what
is
expected
to
be
a
eu
leaders
summit
to
the
deal
sources
in
brussels
said
if
the
european
parliament
and
much
more
uncertain
britain
s
house
of
commons
ratify
the
deal
it
would
give
britain
a
transition
period
after
brexit
day
on
march
it
would
settle
the
divorce
bill
and
ensure
the
rights
of
some
million
expatriates
in
the
future
among
other
things
but
both
the
eu
and
uk
have
also
stepped
up
preparations
for
the
most
damaging
scenario
in
which
they
fail
to
finalise
the
deal
and
britain
crashes
out
from
the
bloc
with
no
agreement
in
place
to
manage
the
fallout
