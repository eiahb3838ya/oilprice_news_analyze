greeceâ€™s deadly fire: a 'blowtorch' no one could stop
athens
reuters
when
the
wind
whipping
wildfire
through
the
pine
forests
around
the
greek
coastal
village
of
mati
suddenly
changed
direction
on
monday
afternoon
it
left
residents
with
perhaps
minutes
to
save
their
lives
for
the
or
more
who
died
it
was
already
too
late
not
even
airplanes
would
have
helped
prevent
this
catastrophe
said
dimitris
stathopoulos
head
of
the
union
of
fire
brigade
employees
in
that
cursed
hour
the
fire
became
a
blowtorch
aimed
at
the
fires
are
not
uncommon
in
greece
s
forests
which
cover
almost
half
its
territory
and
the
mount
penteli
area
has
suffered
regularly
in
the
past
decades
but
until
monday
the
wind
blew
almost
every
fire
inland
towards
the
mountains
shielding
mati
from
all
but
minor
damage
on
monday
it
suddenly
swung
around
to
come
from
the
southwest
and
picked
up
speed
stathopoulos
said
the
time
window
for
any
response
was
roughly
minutes
the
mayor
of
marathon
elias
psinakis
who
is
responsible
for
mati
said
that
was
simply
not
enough
there
is
a
civil
protection
plan
every
municipality
has
one
but
there
is
no
time
to
do
anything
when
the
wind
is
so
strong
he
told
skai
tv
and
that
was
when
mati
s
basic
vulnerabilities
were
suddenly
exposed
unfortunately
this
area
is
chaotically
built
people
couldn
t
find
a
way
out
to
save
themselves
stathopoulos
said
most
of
the
roads
are
dead
ends
and
the
rest
are
very
many
greek
villages
develop
in
a
haphazard
way
houses
are
often
built
without
planning
permission
which
is
then
obtained
retrospectively
without
full
compliance
homes
are
embedded
among
pine
trees
viable
evacuation
routes
are
not
a
priority
a
string
of
torched
cars
on
a
road
leading
to
the
beach
provide
a
chilling
tableau
of
the
scramble
to
find
an
escape
route
they
only
drove
into
traffic
jams
or
thick
treacherous
smoke
television
footage
showed
that
some
cars
had
crashed
in
the
race
to
leave
while
some
ended
up
with
other
vehicles
it
s
tragic
it
s
really
tragic
it
looks
like
the
area
was
hit
by
a
rocket
said
leonidas
leonidou
head
of
a
team
of
firefighters
from
cyprus
the
fire
went
so
fast
i
ve
never
seen
anything
like
it
and
i
ve
got
years
experience
it
was
like
nature
was
dozens
of
people
are
still
missing
and
rescue
teams
are
still
scouring
the
scorched
land
and
the
sea
for
survivors
stathopoulos
complained
that
some
fire
hydrants
had
failed
to
function
but
he
added
that
this
time
the
consequences
of
a
decade
of
national
debt
crisis
that
had
forced
spending
cuts
in
the
fire
brigade
were
not
the
main
reason
for
the
catastrophe
i
ve
often
protested
about
shortages
of
funds
or
staff
about
old
equipment
he
said
but
this
time
none
of
that
could
have
stopped
