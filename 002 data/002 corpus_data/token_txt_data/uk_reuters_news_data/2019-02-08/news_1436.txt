about
we

there
were
people
who
did
not

we
got
into

us
up

were
at
the
beach
with
about
people
some
were
burned
some
were
near
fainting
from
the
smoke
and
the
flames
groups
of
us
we
were
holding
each

medicine
told

it
was
unclear
what
caused
the
fire
which
spread
rapidly
through
the
community
but
some
suggested
that
the
sheer
force
of
winds
thick
pine
fire
and
panic
was
a
deadly
combination
making
even
the
most
evacuation
plan
futile
