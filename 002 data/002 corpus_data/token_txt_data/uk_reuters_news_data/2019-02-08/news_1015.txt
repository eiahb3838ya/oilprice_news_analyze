the

days
of
talks

in

varadkar
said
other
states
offered
him
their
full
support
in
the
brexit
talks
all
of
the
eu
leaders
gave
me
their
absolute
support
in
standing
behind
ireland
saying
that
an
agreement
that
doesn
t
work
for
ireland
doesn
t
work
for
the
eu
the
irish

next
step
is
further
negotiations
with
a
view
to
the
next

and
then
a
summit
after
that
in
november
he
said
adding
he
would
want
a
deal
in
principle
next
month
so
it
can
be
formalised
at
the
following
meeting
time
is
running
out
people
need
to
know
what
is
going
to
happen
after
brexit
day
on
march
the
irish
leader
said
i
really
think
we
have
to
redouble
and
intensify
our
varadkar
reiterated
that
the
emergency
backstop
solution
for
the
irish
border
after
brexit
had
to
be
workable
and
legally
operative
he
said
he
was
waiting
for
a
new
proposal
to
come
from
london
nobody
is
trying
to
dispute
the
constitutional
status
of
northern
ireland
varadkar
said
we
need
to
get
away
from
the
idea
of
anyone
trying
to
create
a
border
between
northern
ireland
and
great
britain
that
s
not
the
eu
s
he
said
the
eu
was
reworking
the
existing
backstop
proposal
by
the
bloc
to
say
that
agriculture
and
phytosanitary
checks
would
be
the
only
physical
controls
that
would
need
to
take
place
between
northern
ireland
and
britain
s
mainland
he
also
spoke
in
favour
of
offering
london
a
declaration
as
detailed
as
possible
on
ties
while
he
said
the
remaining
eu
states
did
not
want
to
punish
britain
they
were
determined
to
defend
their
single
market
the
whole
brexit
project
is
full
of
risks
i
believe
we
can
come
to
a
deal
between
the
european
union
including
ireland
and
the
uk
but
of
course
that
deal
has
to
go
through
the
british
parliament
the
european
parliament
there
are
risks
at
all
steps
of
this
