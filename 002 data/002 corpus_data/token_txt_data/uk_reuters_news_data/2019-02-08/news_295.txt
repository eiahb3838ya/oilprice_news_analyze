syrian surprise: how trump's phone call changed the war
reuters
president
donald
trump
s
declaration
in
a
phone
call
with
tayyip
erdogan
that
he
was
pulling
troops
from
syria
has
stunned
turkey
and
left
it
scrambling
to
respond
to
the
changing
battlefield
on
its
southern
border
in
the
phone
call
two
weeks
ago
trump
had
been
expected
to
deliver
a
standard
warning
to
the
turkish
president
over
his
plan
to
launch
a
crossborder
attack
targeting
kurdish
forces
in
northeast
syria
officials
say
instead
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
trump
reshaped
policy
in
the
middle
east
abandoning
a
quarter
of
syrian
territory
and
handing
ankara
the
job
of
finishing
off
islamic
state
in
syria
trump
asked
if
we
withdraw
our
soldiers
can
you
clean
up
isis
a
turkish
official
told
reuters
he
said
erdogan
replied
that
turkish
forces
were
up
to
the
task
then
you
do
it
trump
told
him
abruptly
to
his
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
also
on
the
call
trump
said
start
work
for
the
withdrawal
of
troops
from
i
have
to
say
it
was
an
unexpected
decision
the
word
surprise
is
too
weak
to
describe
the
situation
said
the
official
one
of
five
turkish
sources
who
spoke
to
reuters
about
the
call
between
the
two
leaders
trump
s
decision
was
also
a
shock
in
washington
where
senior
administration
officials
including
secretary
of
defense
jim
mattis
tried
for
days
to
change
the
president
s
mind
officials
said
when
trump
made
clear
he
would
not
back
down
mattis
and
a
senior
official
coordinating
the
fight
against
islamic
state
brett
mcgurk
both
resigned
on
a
visit
to
a
air
base
in
iraq
this
week
trump
said
that
military
commanders
had
repeatedly
requested
extensions
for
the
troops
in
syria
requests
that
he
finally
turned
down
because
he
said
islamic
state
was
largely
beaten
we
ve
knocked
them
silly
i
will
tell
you
i
ve
had
some
very
good
talks
with
president
erdogan
who
wants
to
knock
them
out
also
and
he
ll
do
it
he
told
american
troops
for
turkey
trump
s
decision
offers
opportunity
and
risk
ankara
has
complained
bitterly
for
years
that
the
united
states
a
nato
ally
had
chosen
the
kurdish
ypg
militia
as
its
main
partner
on
the
ground
in
syria
against
islamic
state
turkey
says
the
ypg
is
a
terrorist
group
inseparable
from
the
kurdistan
workers
party
pkk
which
has
waged
an
insurgency
in
southeast
turkey
in
which
people
have
been
killed
the
withdrawal
potentially
frees
turkey
s
military
to
push
the
ypg
back
from
km
of
border
without
risking
a
confrontation
with
american
forces
it
also
removes
a
main
cause
of
this
year
s
diplomatic
crisis
between
the
two
countries
but
it
also
opens
up
an
area
of
syria
far
larger
than
anything
turkey
had
expected
to
fill
potentially
pitting
it
against
not
just
kurdish
forces
but
also
the
damascus
government
which
is
committed
to
regaining
control
of
all
of
syria
and
its
russian
and
iranian
backers
the
ypg
on
friday
asked
the
syrian
government
to
take
over
the
town
of
manbij
which
the
kurdish
militia
currently
controls
with
support
to
protect
it
from
turkish
attack
and
if
turkish
forces
are
to
take
on
islamic
state
in
its
last
pocket
of
syrian
territory
near
the
iraqi
border
they
would
first
have
to
cross
km
of
territory
controlled
by
the
syrian
democratic
forces
erdogan
got
more
than
he
bargained
for
said
soner
cagaptay
director
of
the
turkish
program
at
the
washington
institute
he
had
asked
the
to
drop
the
ypg
but
not
withdraw
from
syria
erdogan
has
for
years
backed
rebels
who
once
hoped
to
topple
bashar
but
the
syrian
president
s
survival
has
been
assured
by
support
from
tehran
and
moscow
even
though
the
north
and
east
including
syrian
oilfields
remain
beyond
assad
s
control
for
now
as
it
takes
stock
of
the
new
challenge
turkey
is
launching
intensive
talks
with
washington
and
moscow
ankara
expects
military
officials
to
visit
within
days
as
well
as
bolton
and
possibly
the
special
syria
envoy
james
jeffrey
turkey
s
intelligence
chief
and
defence
and
foreign
ministers
are
also
due
in
moscow
on
saturday
the
spokesman
for
erdogan
s
ak
party
said
of
course
it
will
be
difficult
the
whole
issue
needs
to
be
planned
again
from
the
start
a
turkish
security
official
said
a
official
said
military
planners
were
drafting
plans
that
could
see
a
withdrawal
over
the
course
of
several
months
one
of
the
proposals
under
consideration
is
a
withdrawal
period
according
a
person
familiar
with
discussions
washington
is
also
grappling
with
what
to
do
with
weapons
it
provided
to
the
ypg
militia
and
promised
to
take
back
after
the
campaign
against
islamic
state
ended
turkey
says
the
weapons
must
be
collected
so
they
are
not
used
against
turkish
troops
but
officials
say
they
can
not
disarm
their
own
allies
when
the
fight
is
not
yet
over
erdogan
announced
last
week
turkey
is
postponing
its
planned
military
operation
against
the
ypg
in
light
of
trump
s
decision
the
turkish
military
has
already
carried
out
two
incursions
into
north
syria
backed
by
syrian
rebels
in
they
targeted
islamic
state
and
kurdish
fighters
and
earlier
this
year
took
control
of
the
afrin
region
but
ankara
and
its
syrian
rebel
allies
alone
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
take
over
the
whole
region
which
the
united
states
is
abandoning
cagaptay
said
turkey
s
priority
therefore
may
be
to
secure
its
southern
frontier
distancing
the
ypg
from
the
border
and
wiping
out
these
elements
is
of
critical
importance
the
security
official
said
he
stressed
the
need
for
careful
coordination
over
who
should
fill
other
areas
which
departing
forces
will
leave
and
warned
of
problems
ahead
if
agreement
could
not
be
reached
is
it
a
big
victory
for
turkey
another
official
said
i
m
not
sure
right
