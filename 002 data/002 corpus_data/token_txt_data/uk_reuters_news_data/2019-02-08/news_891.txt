at least 40 of may's mps willing to vote down brexit deal, ex-minister says
london
reuters
at
least
lawmakers
in
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
conservative
party
are
willing
to
vote
down
her
possible
brexit
deal
if
it
leaves
the
united
kingdom
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
european
union
a
senior
lawmaker
said
on
tuesday
my
estimate
is
that
there
are
at
least
colleagues
who
are
not
going
to
accept
a
half
in
half
out
chequers
deal
or
indeed
a
backstop
that
leaves
us
in
the
internal
market
and
the
customs
union
lawmaker
steve
baker
told
bbc
radio
colleagues
will
not
tolerate
a
half
in
half
out
brexit
said
baker
who
served
as
a
junior
brexit
minister
in
may
s
government
until
he
resigned
in
protest
at
her
brexit
proposals
if
may
secures
a
deal
with
the
eu
she
has
to
get
the
british
parliament
to
approve
it
and
would
need
the
backing
of
about
lawmakers
to
get
approval
if
of
her
lawmakers
voted
against
a
possible
deal
the
fate
of
the
government
and
exit
process
would
depend
on
the
opposition
labour
party
which
has
indicated
it
will
vote
against
almost
any
deal
may
might
secure
under
may
s
proposals
britain
will
seek
a
free
trade
area
for
goods
with
the
eu
largely
by
accepting
a
common
rulebook
for
goods
and
british
participation
in
eu
agencies
that
provide
authorisations
for
goods
some
brexiteers
say
those
proposals
would
ensure
the
eu
kept
control
over
swathes
of
the
british
economy
and
thus
run
counter
to
the
spirit
of
her
manifesto
pledge
to
leave
the
eu
customs
union
and
the
single
market
we
are
awaiting
the
detail
of
exactly
what
we
are
going
to
be
asked
for
vote
for
i
don
t
doubt
that
every
possible
technique
us
going
to
be
used
to
sow
doubt
in
colleagues
minds
and
to
encourage
them
to
vote
with
the
government
baker
said
in
the
end
the
eu
is
not
entitled
to
split
the
uk
and
it
s
not
entitled
to
constrain
how
we
regulate
our
economy
and
govern
ourselves
after
we
leave
he
added
without
an
approved
deal
the
uk
would
move
from
seamless
trade
with
the
rest
of
the
european
union
to
customs
arrangements
set
by
the
world
trade
organization
for
external
states
with
no
preferential
deals
if
the
uk
faces
either
possibility
then
we
must
in
the
end
be
willing
to
say
it
s
a
bad
deal
and
no
deal
is
better
than
a
bad
deal
baker
said
we
would
need
to
be
unafraid
to
go
forward
