as

swiss
grand
slam
champion

in
saturday
s
the

a
dashing
display
of
power
and
guile
to
stun
the
djokovic

did
he
become
the
youngest
winner
of

in
and
finals
it
means
so
much
zverev
told
reporters
i
m
incredibly
happy
and
incredibly
proud
right
djokovic
had
schooled
zverev
on
wednesday
in
the
stage
but
following
his
victory
over
federer
after
which
he
was
booed
by
fans
over
a
controversial
point
in
the
tiebreak
the
german
was
a
different
proposition
zverev
said
the
loss
to
djokovic
had
prompted
a
different
approach
following
a
discussion
with
coach
ivan
lendl
the
grand
slam
champion
who
helped
britain
s
murray
to
multiple
major
titles
he
obviously
analysed
the
match
that
i
played
with
him
a
few
days
ago
told
me
a
few
things
i
had
to
do
different
i
was
more
aggressive
today
zverev
who
will
end
the
year
ranked
fourth
in
the
atp
rankings
said
after
this
statement
victory
zverev
s
next
task
will
be
to
go
past
the
of
a
grand
slam
for
the
first
time
told
that
djokovic
had
predicted
he
could
surpass
his
own
achievements
including
grand
slam
titles
zverev
was
quick
to
urge
some
perspective
oh
jesus
oh
my
god
zverev
said
i
mean
i
ve
won
one
of
these
he
s
won
five
he
s
won
i
don
t
know
what
titles
more
than
me
let
s
not
go
there
for
after
a
couple
of
years
finding
his
feet
and
learning
to
deal
with
huge
expectation
levels
however
zverev
s
match
wins
this
year
is
proof
of
a
more
mature
attitude
and
a
greater
level
of
consistency
i
will
do
everything
i
can
to
get
better
to
compete
with
them
always
i
feel
like
i
m
doing
that
zverev
said
with
russian
karen
khachanov
who
beat
djokovic
to
win
the
paris
masters
and
greek
stefanos
tsitsipas
also
making
huge
strides
including
a
win
over
djokovic
zverev
believes
the
new
generation
are
starting
to
make
inroads
obviously
us
young
guys
we
re
coming
through
he
said
we
ve
still
got
multiple
years
for
all
of
us
ahead
a
lot
of
things
can
happen
a
lot
of
things
can
change
