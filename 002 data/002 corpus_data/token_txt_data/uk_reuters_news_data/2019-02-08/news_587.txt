klobuchar
told
the
senate
judiciary
committee
she
would
send
a
letter
seeking
details
about
a
new
york
times
article
that
named
the
minnesota

as
a
target
of
an
aggressive
facebook
lobbying
campaign
that
relied
partly
on
a
republican
opposition
research
firm

did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
klobuchar
but
facebook
chief

while
reading
the
new
york
times

definers
did
not
respond
to
a
request
to
comment
the
new
york
times

facebook
conducted
an
aggressive
campaign

combat
critics
shift
public
anger
toward
rival
companies
and
fend
off
new
regulations
contained
in
proposed
legislation
that
klobuchar
supports
this
is
a
pretty
serious
matter
for
those
of
us
on
the
receiving
line
klobuchar
told
the
committee
i
would
like
to
know
what
was
going
on
with
elected

she
said
if
they
in
fact
were
taking
actions
against
critics
this
could
be
a
campaign
finance
issue
it
could
also
have
other
legal
if
facebook
spent
money
trying
to
influence
the
outcome
of
an
election
it
would
have
been
required
to
disclose
that
spending
to
the
federal
election
commission
and
failure
to
do
so
would
be
a
violation
of
the
law
however
recent
supreme
court
rulings
have
given
companies
leeway
requiring
that
they
directly
call
for
someone
to
be
elected
or
lose
their
office
to
trigger
the
campaign
finance
laws
the
times
report
said
facebook
hired
the
republican
firm
to
discredit
activist
protesters
and
lobbied
a
jewish
civil
rights
group
to
cast
some
critics
of
the
company
as
its
issue
with
klobuchar
involved
legislation
known
as
the
honest
ads
act
which
she
has
supported
along
with
democratic
senator
mark
warner
and
the
late
arizona
republican
senator
john
mccain
the
bill
would
compel
facebook
and
other
internet
firms

sponsors
of
political
ads
on
their
websites
