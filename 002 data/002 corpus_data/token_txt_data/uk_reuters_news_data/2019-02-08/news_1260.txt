empty
hotel
rooms
idle
tour
boats
and
shuttered
travel
agencies
reveal
widening
fissures
in
the
tiny
pacific
nation
of
palau
which
is
caught
in
an
escalating
diplomatic
between
china
and
taiwan
late
last
year
china
effectively
banned
tour
groups
to
the
idyllic
tropical
archipelago
branding
it
an
illegal
destination
due
to
its
lack
of
diplomatic
status
as
china
extends
its
influence
across
the
pacific
palau
is
one
of
taipei
s
remaining
allies
worldwide
and
is
under
pressure
to
switch
allegiances
officials
and
business
people
there
say
there
is
an
ongoing
discussion
about
china
weaponising
tourism
said
jeffrey
barabe
owner
of
palau
central
hotel
and
palau
carolines
resort
in
koror
some
believe
that
the
dollars
were
allowed
to
flow
in
and
now
they
are
pulling
it
back
to
try
and
get
palau
to
establish
ties
in
the
commercial
centre
of
koror
the
chinese
pullback
is
obvious
hotel
blocks
and
restaurants
stand
empty
travel
agencies
are
boarded
and
boats
which
take
tourists
to
palau
s
green
mushroom
shaped
rock
islands
are
docked
at
the
piers
prior
to
the
ban
chinese
tourists
accounted
for
about
half
the
visitors
to
palau
of
the
visitors
in
were
from
china
and
from
taiwan
official
data
showed
chinese
investors
had
also
gone
on
a
buying
frenzy
building
hotels
opening
businesses
and
securing
large
swathes
of
prime
coastal
real
estate
the
decline
since
the
ban
was
announced
has
been
so
sharp
charter
airline
palau
pacific
airways
announced
in
july
it
would
terminate
flights
to
china
four
hours
away
from
the
end
of
this
month
the
chinese
government
was
putting
an
effort
to
slow
or
stop
tourists
going
to
palau
said
the
airline
which
has
experienced
a
percent
fall
in
bookings
since
the
china
restrictions
began
china
has
previously
used
its
tourism
clout
as
a
diplomatic
tool
last
year
halting
tours
to
south
korea
after
seoul
installed
a
controversial
missile
defence
system
asked
if
designating
palau
an
illegal
destination
was
a
way
of
putting
pressure
on
it
to
move
away
from
taiwan
china
s
foreign
ministry
said
relations
with
other
countries
had
to
happen
under
the
framework
of
the
one
china
principle
the
one
china
principle
is
the
and
political
foundation
for
china
to
maintain
and
develop
friendly
cooperative
relations
with
all
countries
around
the
world
it
said
in
a
statement
to
reuters
without
specifically
addressing
the
palau
issue
the
one
china
principle
is
a
core
government
policy
that
states
taiwan
is
an
inseparable
part
of
china
taiwan
s
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
says
china
has
lured
four
countries
to
switch
diplomatic
recognition
from
taipei
to
beijing
in
the
past
two
years
by
offering
generous
aid
packages
and
investment
while
taiwan
faces
serious
diplomatic
challenges
the
government
will
not
bow
down
to
pressure
from
beijing
the
ministry
said
on
its
website
taiwan
will
work
with
friendly
nations
to
uphold
regional
peace
and
stability
and
ensure
our
rightful
place
in
the
international
palau
president
tommy
remengesau
said
there
had
been
no
official
communication
from
beijing
on
the
tourism
restrictions
it
is
not
a
secret
that
china
would
like
us
and
the
diplomatic
friends
of
taiwan
to
switch
to
them
but
for
palau
it
is
not
our
choosing
to
decide
the
one
china
policy
he
told
reuters
in
an
interview
in
palau
s
second
biggest
city
meyuns
remengesau
whose
second
and
final
term
as
president
ends
in
january
said
palau
welcomed
investment
and
tourism
from
china
but
the
current
administration
s
principles
and
democratic
ideals
aligned
more
closely
with
taiwan
palau
was
adapting
to
the
china
pullback
by
focusing
on
higher
spending
visitors
rather
than
mass
tourism
which
had
taken
a
toll
on
the
environment
said
remengesau
dressed
in
a
lemon
coloured
shirt
and
white
shell
necklace
one
of
palau
s
key
tourist
attractions
the
saltwater
jellyfish
lake
was
shut
in
after
large
numbers
of
swimmers
were
blamed
for
contributing
to
plummeting
jellyfish
numbers
the
reality
is
that
numbers
did
not
mean
big
revenues
for
palau
it
actually
made
us
more
determined
to
seek
the
policy
of
quality
versus
quantity
said
remengesau
who
in
declared
most
of
palau
s
territorial
waters
a
marine
sanctuary
the
size
of
california
former
palau
government
officials
say
beijing
is
trying
to
cement
its
influence
in
the
region
ahead
of
the
expiry
of
the
compact
funding
agreements
between
the
united
states
the
federated
states
of
micronesia
the
marshall
islands
and
palau
in
and
the
united
states
provides
around
million
a
year
on
average
to
the
compact
states
and
is
responsible
for
the
defence
of
the
three
countries
which
each
hold
a
seat
at
the
united
nations
last
december
the
belatedly
approved
million
in
assistance
for
palau
through
till
but
has
not
announced
any
plans
to
extend
the
compact
agreements
the
united
states
and
china
are
not
competitors
a
state
department
spokesperson
told
reuters
however
we
have
concerns
about
the
sustainability
of
debt
loads
for
countries
highly
indebted
to
china
as
well
as
the
environmental
social
or
labour
conditions
that
often
come
along
with
a
june
security
report
from
the
economic
and
security
review
commission
said
beijing
s
increasing
economic
engagement
in
the
pacific
was
driven
by
its
diplomatic
and
strategic
priorities
including
reducing
taiwan
s
international
presence
gaining
access
to
natural
resources
and
developing
a
blue
water
navy
former
micronesian
government
officials
said
beijing
also
wants
to
extend
its
belt
and
road
initiative
to
palau
and
could
provide
an
important
source
of
investment
once
the
compact
agreement
expires
china
is
making
overtures
said
former
palau
president
johnson
toribiong
we
should
be
bringing
in
investors
and
that
is
a
big
factor
in
our
toribiong
who
served
until
told
reuters
palau
should
not
isolate
itself
i
like
taiwan
but
even
taiwanese
want
china
now
the
businessmen
they
also
want
china
they
don
t
care
about
political
consequence
think
about
the
economics
toribiong
said
palau
receives
million
annually
from
taiwan
as
well
as
education
and
medical
scholarships
remengesau
said
palau
has
not
had
any
official
talks
with
china
for
funding
after
the
compact
expires
but
the
government
was
discussing
the
issue
internally
china
has
quickly
become
one
of
the
dominant
economic
players
in
the
pacific
spending
billions
of
dollars
in
trade
investment
aid
and
tourism
across
micronesia
and
the
broader
region
china
s
total

with

forum
member
countries

billion
in
versus
billion
for
the
united
states
according
to
the
security
report
chinese
concessional
loans
to
pacific
islands
have
also
risen
sharply
in
contrast
washington
s
efforts
to
strengthen
its
position
in
palau
have
been
largely
superficial
according
to
locals
who
cite
examples
of
bigger
flags
on
their
official
vehicles
and
increased
public
signage
chinese
activity
has
slowed
significantly
however
barabe
the
resort
owner
said
chinese
investors
had
secured
leases
for
around
hotel
projects
prior
to

construction
has
been
