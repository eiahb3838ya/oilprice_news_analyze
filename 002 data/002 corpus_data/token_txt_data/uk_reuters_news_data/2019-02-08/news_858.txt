north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
is
sincere
and
really
means
to
abandon
nuclear
weapons
south
korean
president
moon
told
a
french
newspaper
adding
that
the
international
community
needed
to
reward
him
for
that
kim
and
president
donald
trump
pledged
at
a
landmark
summit
in
singapore
in
june
to
work
towards
denuclearisation
but
the
agreement
was
short
on
specifics
and
talks
have
made
little
headway
since
with
the
north
refusing
to
declare
its
nuclear
weapons
and
facilities
or
agree
to
a
concrete
timeline
this
year
i
have
discussed
in
depth
with
kim
for
hours
these
meetings
have
convinced
me
that
he
has
taken
the
strategic
decision
to
abandon
his
nuclear
weapon
moon
told
le
figaro
in
an
interview
before
a
state
visit
to
paris
moon
is
to
meet
president
emmanuel
macron
on
monday
while
pyongyang
has
stopped
nuclear
and
missile
tests
this
year
it
failed
to
keep
its
promise
to
allow
international
inspections
of
its
dismantling
of
the
site
in
may
stirring
criticism
that
the
move
could
be
reversed
but
moon
said
kim
was
sincere
calm
and
polite
and
felt
frustrated
by
the
international
community
s
continuing
mistrust
it
is
now
time
to
respond
to
these
efforts
that
were
hard
to
agree
to
moon
said
we
need
to
assure
kim
jong
un
that
he
took
the
right
decision
in
deciding
to
denuclearise
and
we
need
to
accompany
him
in
his
wish
for
a
durable
and
solid
washington
wants
concrete
action
such
as
a
full
disclosure
of
north
korea
s
nuclear
and
missile
facilities
before
meeting
pyongyang
s
demands
including
an
official
end
to
the
korean
war
and
the
easing
of
international
sanctions
moon
said
he
hoped
another
summit
would
allow
the
two
leaders
to
go
further
than
the
statements
they
made
at
their
first
meeting
in
singapore
declaring
an
end
to
the
korea
war
would
be
a
start
to
establishing
a
regime
of
peace
he
said
also
calling
for
the
united
states
to
take
reliable
corresponding
measures
to
guarantee
the
security
of
the
regime
we
could
also
in
the
future
discuss
the
easing
of
sanctions
in
accordance
with
progress
on
denuclearisation
he
