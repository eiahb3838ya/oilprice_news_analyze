suffered
a
fall
in
december
sales
for
the
sixth
straight
year
a
survey
showed
on
saturday
hurt
by
brittle
consumer
confidence
and
the
ongoing
shift
to
buying
online
accountancy
and
business
advisory
firm
bdo
said
its
monthly
high

high

sales
fell
by
percent
in
december
an
eleventh
consecutive
month
of
decline
bdo
said
online
sales
grew
percent
in
december
as
retailers
suffered
the
worst
year
for
well
over
a
decade
for
sales
it
s
clear
that
consumer
confidence
is
low
said
sophie
michael
head
of
retail
and
wholesale
at
bdo
shoppers
have
exercised
extreme
caution
or
shopped
strategically
online
seeking
out
discounts
rather
than
visiting
bricks
and
mortar
stores
or
making
impulse
purchases
she
said
adding
was
set
to
be
another
challenging
year
for
the
sector
analysts
have
highlighted
a
disconnect
between
supportive
economic
factors
with
consumers
real
earnings
growing
and
employment
levels
high
and
an
apparent
reluctance
to
spend
partly
due
to
uncertainty
over
britain
s
departure
from
the
european
union
in
march
britain
s
economic
growth
slowed
to
a
crawl
at
the
end
of
and
the
housing
market
is
stalling
according
to
data
published
on

less
than

months
before
brexit
day
clothing
chain
next
is
the
only
major
listed
uk
retailer
to
have
reported
on
christmas
trade
so
far
it
fared
better
than
expected
with
a
late
surge
in
online
demand
offsetting
steep
falls
in
store
sales
a
raft
of
retailers
are
due
to
