determine
the
future
of
the
country
the
chief
eu
brexit
negotiator
said
on
thursday
insisting
that
the
deal
was
the
only
route
to
secure
an
orderly
withdrawal
from
the
eu
if
there
is
no
withdrawal
treaty
there
is
no
transition
no
basis
of
confidence
that
we
need
with
the
british
regarding
the
future
relationship
michel
barnier
told
representatives
from
cities
and
regions
in
the
european
union
barnier
told
the
gathering
of
the
european
committee
of
the
regions
that
it
was
key
now
that
the
withdrawal
treaty
agreed
between
brussels
and
london
be
ratified
now
is
now
the
moment
for
everyone
to
bear
their
responsibilities
you
know
the
british
parliament
will
give
its
verdict
on
this
text
and
on
the
future
relationship
in
the
coming
days
it
is
a
vote
in
which
the
future
of
their
country
is
at
the
british
parliament
is
due
to
vote
on
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
brexit
deal
next
tuesday
with
the
odds
looking
stacked
against
may
s
government
winning
that
vote
many
of
may
s
conservatives
are
particularly
sceptical
about
the
fallback
arrangement
or
backstop
to
guarantee
that
there
is
no
return
to
a
hard
border
between
ireland
and
northern
ireland
seen
as
essential
to
preserving
peace
supporters
of
a
clean
break
with
the
eu
say
the
backstop
could
leave
britain
forced
to
accept
eu
regulations
indefinitely
or
northern
ireland
treated
differently
from
the
rest
of
britain
this
backstop
said
barnier
we
will
do
everything
we
can
to
avoid
using
barnier
repeated
his
view
that
the
brexit
deal
that
may
wants
the
british
parliament
to
back
is
the
best
britain
will
get
to
arrange
its
orderly
withdrawal
from
the
eu
the
agreement
that
is
on
the
table
the
withdrawal
agreement
and
the
agreement
on
the
future
relationship
are
in
our
view
the
only
and
best
possible
to
organise
an
orderly
withdrawal
