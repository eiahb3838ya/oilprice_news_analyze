washington
reuters
the
economy
was
expected
to
lose
billion
from
the
partial
federal
government
shutdown
over
president
donald
trump
s
demand
for
border
wall
funding
congressional
researchers
said
on
monday
as
federal
employees
returned
to
work
after
days
without
pay
the
nonpartisan
congressional
budget
office
said
the
cost
of
the
shutdown
would
make
the
economy
percent
smaller
than
expected
in
more
significant
effects
will
be
felt
by
individual
businesses
and
workers
particularly
those
who
scrambled
to
make
ends
after
not
being
paid
overall
the
economy
lost
about
billion
during
the
period
the
cbo
said
it
expects
billion
to
be
recovered
however
as
the
government
reopens
and
employees
receive
back
pay
the
longest
shutdown
in
history
ended
on
friday
when
trump
and
congress
agreed
to
temporary
government
funding
without
money
for
his
border
wall
as
the
effects
of
the
shutdown
intensified
across
the
country
the
republican
president
had
demanded
that
legislation
to
fund
the
government
contain
billion
for
his
wall
he
says
it
is
necessary
to
stop
illegal
immigration
human
trafficking
and
drug
smuggling
while
democrats
call
it
costly
and
inefficient
a
committee
of
republican
and
democratic
lawmakers
have
scheduled
an
initial
meeting
on
wednesday
which
will
be
open
to
the
public
as
they
try
to
negotiate
a
compromise
on
border
security
before
the
deadline
that
session
is
likely
to
see
little
more
than
opening
statements
by
lawmakers
subsequent
meetings
could
be
conducted
in
private
where
the
hard
bargaining
would
take
place
several
congressional
aides
said
owing
to
rules
governing
legislation
in
the
house
of
representatives
requiring
a
period
for
lawmakers
to
review
legislation
before
having
to
vote
on
it
the
committee
might
have
to
wrap
up
its
work
by
around
in
order
to
meet
a
deadline
for
congressional
approval
trump
said
he
would
be
willing
to
shut
down
the
government
again
if
lawmakers
do
not
reach
a
deal
he
finds
acceptable
on
border
security
on
sunday
he
expressed
skepticism
such
an
deal
could
be
made
trump
has
also
said
he
might
declare
a
national
emergency
to
get
money
for
the
border
wall
democrats
would
likely
challenge
that
in
court
democratic
lawmakers
said
the
cbo
report
served
as
a
stark
warning
to
trump
against
another
shutdown
families
across
the
nation
are
still
trying
to
recover
from
a
month
of
missing
paychecks
and
overdue
bills
but
the
president
is
already
threatening
a
second
shutdown
if
he
doesn
t
get
his
way

most

those
who
worked
without
pay
or
were
furloughed
contractors
and
businesses
that
relied
on

business
face
huge
