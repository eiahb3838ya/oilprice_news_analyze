washington
reuters
this
november
story
has
been
refiled
to
correct
day
of
congressional
elections
to
november
in
the
second
paragraph
two
democratic
senators
on
sunday
said
voters
angry
that
republicans
confirmed
brett
kavanaugh
to
the
supreme
court
despite
allegations
of
sexual
misconduct
should
focus
on
next
month
s
congressional
elections
instead
of
seeking
to
impeach
the
new
justice
some
democrats
in
the
house
of
representatives
have
indicated
kavanaugh
could
face
investigations
or
even
potential
impeachment
if
they
win
majorities
in
the
house
and
possibly
the
senate
but
senators
chris
coons
and
mazie
hirono
distanced
themselves
from
those
demands
saying
they
are
concentrating
on
the
congressional
elections
i
think
that
s
premature
coons
said
of
impeachment
talk
on
nbc
s
meet
the
frankly
we
are
just
less
than
a
month
away
from
an
election
folks
who
feel
very
strongly
one
way
or
other
about
the
issues
in
front
of
us
should
get
out
and
vote
and
kavanaugh
was
sworn
in
late
on
saturday
amid
protests
at
the
court
after
he
was
narrowly
confirmed
in
a
senate
vote
but
with
questions
raised
from
democrats
and
liberal
groups
as
to
whether
he
will
be
a
partisan
justice
democrats
are
hopeful
of
winning
control
of
the
house
but
the
senate
is
a
long
shot
republicans
say
that
anger
on
the
right
at
the
way
democrats
treated
kavanaugh
may
have
energized
their
voters
as
well
president
donald
trump
said
the
public
protests
against
kavanaugh
were
the
work
of
an
angry
mob
and
has
urged
his
supporters
to
vote
in
november
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
said
on
saturday
that
nothing
unifies
republicans
like
a
court
with
both
parties
focusing
on
the
confirmation
battle
it
is
unclear
who
will
capitalise
on
it
most
effectively
in
the
elections
hirono
speaking
on
abc
s
this
week
said
i
m
focused
like
a
laser
beam
on
the
elections
when
asked
about
impeachment
i
m
very
focused
on
the
here
and
now
which
is
that
all
these
angry
women
mainly
out
there
who
saw
what
was
going
on
and
how
the
senate
was
not
able
to
deal
with
the
entire
issue
of
sexual
assault
she
said
noting
that
only
one
supreme
court
justice
has
ever
been
impeached
coons
said
the
senate
needed
to
show
leadership
and
seek
to
heal
the
country
i
think
talking
about
it
at
this
point
isn
t
necessarily
healing
us
and
moving
us
forward
he
said
samuel
chase
in
was
the
only
justice
to
be
impeached
by
the
house
he
was
acquitted
by
the
senate
the
following
year
kavanaugh
fought
back
against
the
accusations
with
a
blistering
partisan
attack
at
a
senate
hearing
on
christine
blasey
ford
s
allegation
that
he
had
sexually
assaulted
her
when
they
were
in
high
school
kellyanne
conway
a
senior
white
house
adviser
said
on
abc
s
this
week
that
the
focus
should
turn
from
kavanaugh
s
combative
testimony
and
toward
his
years
as
a
respected
appeals
court
judge
in
washington
the
supreme
court
thank
god
is
a
sacrosanct
institution
that
can
withstand
much
conway
said
kavanaugh
s
confirmation
means
the
court
now
has
a
solid
conservative
majority
that
is
likely
to
move
the
court
further
to
the
right
as
it
rules
on
contentious
issues
such
as
abortion
immigration
transgender
rights
industry
regulation
and
presidential
powers
