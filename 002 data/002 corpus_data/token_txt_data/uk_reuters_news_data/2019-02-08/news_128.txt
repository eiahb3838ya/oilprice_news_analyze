ecb's draghi warns of weaker growth ahead
frankfurt
reuters
european
central
bank
president
mario
draghi
acknowledged
on
thursday
that
economic
growth
in
the
euro
zone
was
likely
to
be
weaker
than
earlier
expected
due
to
the
from
factors
ranging
from
china
s
slowdown
to
brexit
the
region
s
economy
is
already
suffering
its
biggest
slowdown
in
half
a
decade
raising
questions
over
whether
the
ecb
will
be
able
to
increase
interest
rates
for
the
first
time
in
a
decade
later
this
year
as
its
current
guidance
indicates
the
ecb
left
that
guidance
and
interest
rates
unchanged
at
its
meeting
on
thursday
but
draghi
s
downbeat
comments
including
a
reference
to
downside
risks
will
fuel
market
speculation
that
the
bank
will
delay
any
rate
hike
mirroring
a
more
cautious
approach
by
the
federal
reserve
and
may
offer
new
cheap
loans
to
banks
the
risks
surrounding
the
euro
area
growth
outlook
have
moved
to
the
downside
on
account
of
the
persistence
of
uncertainties
draghi
told
a
news
conference
citing
trade
and
geopolitical
threats
and
emerging
market
volatility
the
growth
momentum
is
likely
to
be
weaker
than
previously
his
comments
pushed
the
dollar
to
a
more
than
high
against
the
euro
the
single
currency
was
percent
lower
against
the
dollar
at
after
falling
as
low
as
its
weakest
since
despite
citing
the
rising
risks
draghi
nonetheless
reeled
off
reasons
for
not
changing
policy
now
notably
the
strength
of
the
region
s
labor
market
and
rising
wage
growth
which
he
said
would
help
push
underlying
inflation
up
over
the
medium
term
the
key
factor
to
assess
is
the
persistence
of
the
uncertainty
he
said
adding
he
was
confident
that
those
uncertainties
ranging
from
the
outcome
of
brexit
to
china
s
slowdown
and
trade
protectionism
were
being
addressed
the
governing
council
will
give
itself
more
time
to
assess
whether
all
these
risk
factors
have
affected
confidence
and
we
are
going
to
have
another
discussion
in
march
when
we
will
also
have
the
new
growth
draghi
said
the
governing
council
was
unanimous
both
in
acknowledging
the
growth
slowdown
and
the
factors
causing
it
but
some
policymakers
were
less
optimistic
than
others
about
the
economic
outlook
with
the
ecb
already
owning
a
quarter
of
the
euro
zone
s
outstanding
governing
debt
analysts
were
expecting
it
to
turn
to
other
instruments
to
keep
credit
flowing
a
new
round
of
cheap
loans
to
banks
known
as
targeted
refinancing
operations
tltro
was
widely
seen
as
the
first
port
of
call
we
do
expect
an
announcement
in
march
that
t
ltros
will
be
extended
most
likely
via
variable
rate
operations
frederik
ducrozet
an
economist
at
pictet
wealth
management
said
draghi
said
on
thursday
tltros
had
been
raised
by
several
policymakers
but
no
decision
had
been
taken
having
ended
a
landmark
trillion
euro
trillion
bond
purchase
scheme
just
weeks
ago
the
ecb
said
on
thursday
it
still
expected
to
keep
interest
rates
at
record
lows
through
the
summer
sticking
with
its
guidance
even
though
markets
now
see
a
much
later
move
investors
see
a
rate
hike
only
in
while
a
reuters
poll
of
economists
predicted
the
first
rise
in
nearly
a
decade
in
the
fourth
quarter
when
markets
place
the
first
rate
hike
in
they
are
using
the
state
contingent
part
of
our
forward
guidance
and
it
shows
that
they
have
understood
our
reaction
function
draghi
said
with
thursday
s
decision
the
ecb
s
deposit
rate
now
its
main
benchmark
remains
at
percent
while
the
main
refinancing
rate
its
key
rate
during
normal
times
stands
at
percent
germany
france
and
italy
the
euro
zone
s
biggest
economies
barely
grew
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
and
survey
data
showed
on
thursday
business
activity
across
the
euro
zone
expanded
at
the
slowest
pace
since
at
the
start
of
this
year
draghi
said
on
thursday
that
the
ecb
did
not
see
recessions
as
likely
in
germany
or
italy
but
the
reference
to
downside
risks
meant
the
central
bank
had
now
given
up
its
facade
of
optimism
and
joined
the
federal
reserve
in
signaling
a
more
cautious
stance
some
policymakers
have
in
the
past
objected
to
changing
the
risk
assessment
since
such
a
move
would
raise
expectations
of
policy
action
and
the
ecb
is
not
yet
prepared
for
such
a
move
just
weeks
after
ending
its
biggest
stimulus
scheme
with
today
s
meeting
the
ecb
has
joined
the
crowd
of
concern
carsten
brzeski
an
economist
at
ing
said
the
return
of
a
downside
risks
to
the
growth
assessment
does
not
yet
signal
any
policy
changes
but
only
a
slight
easing
