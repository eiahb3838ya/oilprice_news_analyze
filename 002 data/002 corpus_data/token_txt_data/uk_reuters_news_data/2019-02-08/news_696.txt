their
cooks
and
servants
to
kill
them
saiful
mulook
had
kept
a
low
profile
during
the
years
he
represented
bibi
a
who
has
been
on
death
row
since
due
to
the
highly
sensitive
nature
of
the
case
two
politicians
who
had
tried
to
help
her
have
been
assassinated
mulook
told
reuters
in
a
whatsapp
message
he
had
gone
abroad
just
to
save
my
life
from
angry
mob
and
because
of
fears
for
the
safety
of
his
family
i
consulted
and
everybody
is
of
this
opinion
that
i
should
leave
he
said
adding
that
he
would
return
to
the
country
to
continue
his
work
on
the
case
if
he
was
given
protection
by
security
forces
the
tlp
called
off
the
protests
late
on
friday
after
striking
a
deal
with
the
government
that
would
see
authorities
seek
to
put
bibi
on
an
exit
control
list
barring
her
from
leaving
the
country
bibi
s
whereabouts
are
unknown
but
islamists
have
warned
the
authorities
against
taking
her
out
of
the
country
there
will
be
a
war
if
they
send
asia
out
of
country
tlp
leader
khadim
hussain
rizvi
said
after
the
deal
was
reached
earlier
in
the
week
one
of
rizvi
s
deputies
called
for
pakistan
s
chief
justice
saqib
nisar
and
two
other
judges
who
ruled
in
the
case
to
be
murdered
whoever
who
has
got
any
access
to
them
kill
them
before
the
evening
tlp
muhammad
afzal
qadri
told
supporters
the
tlp
was
founded
out
of
a
movement
supporting
a
bodyguard
who
assassinated
punjab
provincial
governor
salman
taseer
after
he
spoke
in
bibi
s
defence
in
federal
minister
for
minorities
shahbaz
bhatti
was
also
killed
after
calling
for
her
release
bibi
was
convicted
of
blasphemy
in
for
allegedly
making
derogatory
remarks
about
islam
after
neighbours
objected
to
her
drinking
water
from
their
glass
because
she
was
not
muslim
she
always
denied
having
committed
blasphemy
the
case
has
outraged
christians
worldwide
and
been
a
source
of
division
within
pakistan
where
islamist
parties
such
as
the
tlp
have
framed
bibi
s
release
as
pakistan
s
government
caving
into
western
demands
bibi
s
acquittal
is
being
reviewed
though
it
is
extremely
rare
for
a
review
to
overturn
a
supreme
court
ruling
