got
into

american
s
head

seventh
seed
pliskova
saved
a
match
point
at
down
in
the
deciding
set
and
another
three
at
before
williams
crumbled
in
front
of
a
stunned
crowd
at
rod
laver
arena
the
win
booked
the
tall
czech
her
first
melbourne
and
she
will
meet
open
champion
naomi
osaka
for
a
place
in
the
pliskova
described
the
victory
as
the
comeback
of
her
life
but
one
that
wouldn
t
have
happened
without
some
assistance
from
her
grand
slam
champion
opponent
she
was
already
match
point
up
in
that
game
lots
of
things
happened
in
those
games
i
just
felt
a
chance
she
told
reporters
i
think
she
maybe
got
little
bit
i
don
t
know
for
sure
it
was
in
her
head
lots
of
things
happen
i
saw
a
chance
and
i
just
took
the
czech
was
brilliant
in
the
face
of
defeat
capturing
the
decisive
break
in
the
game
before
sealing
the
win
on
a
third
match
point
when
williams
slapped
a
forehand
into
the
net
her
unforced
error
having
avenged
her
loss
to
williams
at
the
open
pliskova
now
has
an
enviable
grand
slam
record
against
the
american
great
having
beaten
her
in
two
of
their
three
matches
at
the
majors
pliskova
toppled
williams
at
the
open
when
the
american
was
top
seed
but
felt
the
williams
she
faced
at
melbourne
park
had
played
better
i
think
honestly
she
played
much
better
than
when
she
was
playing
when
i
beat
her
in
new
york
the
match
was
so
much
better
there
were
more
mistakes
in
new
york
maybe
she
was
nervous
it
was
in
pliskova
who
reached
world
number
one
in
but
has
yet
to
claim
a
grand
slam
title
has
a
chance
to
regain
the
top
ranking
if
she
wins
the
tournament
her
next
opponent
osaka
and
compatriot
petra
kvitova
who
faces
danielle
collins
in
the
next
match
are
also
in
the
running
to
be
crowned
number
one
i
don
t
want
to
say
it
means
zero
but
it
doesn
t
mean
the
same
right
now
in
this
situation
it
would
not
mean
the
same
as
winning
the
grand
slam
she
said
i
m
not
going
to
chase
this
so
for
me
nothing
is
pliskova
has
won
two
out
of
three
of
her
matches
against
osaka
she
fell
to
the
in
the
at
indian
wells
last
year
before
beating
her
in
front
of
home
fans
in
their
last
meeting
at
the
japan
open
yeah
i
ve
played
a
few
hitters
here
in
the
last
matches
obviously
camila
giorgi
now
serena
i
think
i
m
well
prepared
for
naomi
said
pliskova
if
i
play
well
i
think
for
sure
