a
widespread

among

from
washington
for
working
with
targeted
russian
individuals
and
entities
for
russia
s
elite
such
steps
could
close

well
as
a
safe
haven
for
billions
of
rubles
of
their
wealth
credit
suisse
works
with
international
regulators
wherever
it
does
business
to
ensure
compliance
with
sanctions
including
compliance
with
sanctions
involving
russia
said
a
spokeswoman
for
the
bank
which
did
not
identify
the
owners
of
the
money
long
popular
with
wealthy
russians
for
its
combination
of
bank
secrecy
political
stability
and
glitzy

such
as
zermatt
and
moritz
switzerland
has
become
one

would
like

remain
strained

members
of

where
both

are
controlled
by
trump
s
fellow
republicans
called
for
more
action
including
introducing
new
sanctions
legislation
from
hell
to
punish
the
russian
menace
while
sanctions
do
not
apply
to
neutral
switzerland
its
banks
are
obliged
to
follow
suit
because
they
depend
on
access
to
the
dollar
and
could
be
blackballed
by
the
united
states
for
any
missteps
