a
wide
range
of
apple
inc
products
including
the
apple
watch
would
be
affected
by
proposed
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
the
company
told
trade
officials
but
gave
no
sign
of
an
impact
on
its
iphone
cash
cow
apple
did
not
disclose
specific
revenues
for
most
of
the
affected
products
but
of
those
the
apple
watch
may
be
the
biggest
seller
it
brought
in
about
billion
billion
pounds
in
revenue
last
year
according
to
an
estimate
from
analyst
firm
bernstein
that
represents
a
small
portion
of
apple
s
billion
in
overall
sales
apple
laid
out
the
impact
on
its
products
of
the
trump
administration
s
proposed
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
in
an
unsigned
letter
it
submitted
on
wednesday
to
officials
as
part
of
a
public
comment
period
on
friday
president
donald
trump
speaking
aboard
air
force
one
said
that
he
has
tariffs
on
an
additional
billion
in
chinese
goods
ready
to
go
on
short
notice
if
i
cell
phones
the
biggest
import
from
china
have
so
far
been
spared
but
would
be
hit
if
trump
activates
the
new
billion
tariff
list
airpods
headphones
some
of
apple
s
beats
headphones
and
its
new
homepod
smart
speaker
also
face
levies
as
part
of
the
proposed
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
according
to
the
letter
submitted
on
wednesday
our
concern
with
these
tariffs
is
that
the
will
be
hardest
hit
and
that
will
result
in
lower
growth
and
competitiveness
and
higher
prices
for
consumers
apple
said
in
the
letter
apple
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
the
letter
did
not
mention
the
iphone
which
accounted
for
about
of
apple
s
billion
in
revenue
in
its
most
recent
fiscal
year
the
letter
also
made
no
mention
of
the
ipad
which
brought
in
billion
in
sales
in
the
most
recent
year
or
most
of
its
mac
computers
which
generated
billion
apple
did
say
its
macmini
a
computer
that
comes
without
a
keyboard
or
mouse
would
be
affected
many
apple
accessories
such
as
mice
keyboards
chargers
and
even
leather
covers
for
iphones
and
ipads
would
face
tariffs
apple
said
reuters
reported
in
july
that
the
apple
watch
was
likely
to
be
affected
by
the
tariffs
shares
of
apple
closed
down
percent
in
regular
nasdaq
trade
on
friday
and
slipped
another
percent
in
extended
trading
apple
also
said
that
computer
parts
for
its
operations
would
be
hit
by
the
tariffs
the
company
said
that
main
logic
boards
with
microprocessing
units
could
face
levies
along
with
equipment
used
for
research
and
development
on
apple
s
most
recent
earnings
call
in
july
chief
executive
officer
tim
cook
said
the
company
could
face
such
tariffs
related
to
data
in
its
letter
apple
argued
that
the
way
trade
officials
calculate
the
trade
balance
attributing
the
entire
value
of
a
product
to
a
country
like
china
where
final
assembly
happens
fails
to
reflect
the
true
value
that
apple
generates
in
the
united
states
the
company
noted
it
spent
billion
with
suppliers
in
its
most
recent
fiscal
year
including
chip
firm
finisar
corp
and
corning
given
the
balance
of
apple
s
economic
footprint
the
burden
of
the
proposed
tariffs
will
fall
much
more
heavily
on
the
united
states
than
on
china
apple
said
in
its
letter
the
technology
sector
is
one
of
the
biggest
potential
losers
in
the
proposed
billion
tariff
list
fitness
tracker
maker
fitbit
said
it
would
be
hit
by
tariffs
and
chipmaker
intel
corp
said
the
levies
could
slow
down
the
adoption
of
networks
the
next
generation
of
wireless
data
technology
for
phones
and
other
devices
