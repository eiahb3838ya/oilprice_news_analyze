a matter of volume - threat from ascendant chinese phones hangs over apple
san
francisco
reuters
a
raft
of
profit
warnings
from
apple
inc
suppliers
this
week
has
fuelled
investor
concerns
that
iphone
sales
in
terms
of
volume
have
hit
a
wall
that
could
spell
trouble
for
the
company
s
plans
to
make
services
its
main
pillar
of
growth
for
the
past
year
investors
had
largely
been
willing
to
overlook
stagnating
unit
sales
of
the
iphone
because
average
selling
prices
kept
rising
but
it
now
faces
fierce
competition
from
phones
from
makers
such
as
xiaomi
corp
apple
has
often
stated
its
plan
to
increase
its
revenue
from
paid
services
such
as
apple
music
and
icloud
that
at
least
in
part
requires
a
growing
base
of
device
owners
driven
by
its
iphone
which
analysts
believe
accounts
for
about
of
the
billion
apple
devices
in
use
around
the
world
wall
street
analysts
have
expressed
concerns
that
slower
overall
smartphone
sales
will
make
it
harder
for
apple
to
hold
smartphone
market
share
as
people
put
off
buying
its
generally
more
expensive
phones
that
in
turn
could
hurt
the
growth
of
apple
s
services
revenue
said
bernstein
s
toni
sacconaghi
without
volume
growth
in
promising
overseas
markets
such
as
india
brazil
and
russia
the
worry
among
analysts
and
investors
is
that
apple
has
at
least
parts
of
its
strategy
wrong
with
too
much
emphasis
on
its
premium
brand
and
the
high
prices
that
go
with
it
more
than
pounds
for
its
top
models
hal
eddins
chief
economist
for
apple
shareholder
capital
investment
counsel
said
phones
like
the
oneplus
are
roughly
comparable
to
apple
s
phones
for
almost
half
the
price
you
can
get
a
lot
of
phone
for
a
lot
less
he
said
the
phone
landscape
is
rapidly
changing
and
i
think
manufacturers
are
missing
a
trick
by
going
the
apple
declined
to
comment
on
its
strategy
or
the
share
moves
among
its
suppliers
the
company
s
executives
have
warned
investors
in
the
past
against
fixating
on
sparse
data
points
from
its
large
supply
chain
apple
has
for
more
than
a
decade
insisted
that
its
gadgets
should
not
be
judged
on
their
specs
alone
an
argument
that
sales
data
suggests
apple
made
successfully
the
company
also
has
customer
satisfaction
and
loyalty
rates
that
are
unparalleled
in
the
mobile
phone
industry
said
ben
bajarin
an
analyst
with
creative
strategies
nevertheless
a
trio
of
chinese
smartphone
makers
xiaomi
oppo
and
vivo
accounted
for
roughly
a
quarter
of
the
global
market
in
the
first
half
of
according
to
data
from
research
firm
idc
up
from
just
percent
for
all
of
and
almost
percent
last
year
with
the
exception
of
fiscal
apple
has
not
increased
its
market
share
it
had
percent
of
the
world
market
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
down
from
percent
for
although
its
share
typically
rises
with
results
due
to
strong
sales
in
december
the
billion
iphones
ipads
and
macs
used
around
the
world
serves
as
the
pool
of
potential
customers
for
apple
s
services
a
business
that
hit
billion
in
revenue
for
the
most
recent
fiscal
year
that
represented
percent
of
apple
s
overall
revenue
up
from
percent
in
fiscal
when
iphone
unit
sales
hit
their
high
but
idc
expects
the
global
smartphone
market
to
grow
only
percent
on
a
compound
basis
to
billion
units
by
indicating
a
saturated
market
in
which
the
cupertino
firm
will
be
fighting
rivals
for
each
customer
xiaomi
in
particular
is
gaining
fans
rapidly
in
india
where
apple
has
only
a
minor
presence
xiaomi
has
in
some
quarters
beat
samsung
electronics
co
ltd
to
become
the
country
s
top
phone
seller
and
is
also
making
headway
into
european
markets
like
spain
idc
said
in
a
report
according
to
data
from
idc
xiaomi
was
the
top
smartphone
seller
in
india
in
the
first
and
second
quarters
of
with
percent
and
percent
respectively
of
the
market
for
smartphone
units
there
this
is
the
case
where
it
s
much
different
in
other
parts
of
the
world
said
ryan
reith
programme
vice
president
for
idc
s
mobile
device
tracking
programme
noting
that
most
consumers
are
not
familiar
with
xiaomi
oppo
and
vivo
phones
many
of
those
brands
don
t
play
in
the
united
states
but
they
re
playing
in
places
where
they
never
played
before
such
as
india
and
europe
he
said
in
its
latest
earnings
this
month
apple
shocked
investors
with
a
sales
forecast
for
the
holiday
shopping
quarter
and
with
its
announcement
that
it
would
stop
reporting
unit
sales
for
its
hardware
products
as
has
been
customary
for
the
last
years
underscoring
flattening
iphone
unit
sales
it
also
said
it
sold
million
iphones
in
its
most
recent
fiscal
year
virtually
unchanged
from
the
year
before
and
well
below
a
high
point
of
million
in
fiscal
its
share
price
hit
at
the
time
of
the
forecast
has
since
extended
losses
after
profit
warnings
from
suppliers
like
japan
display
inc
british
chipmaker
iqe
plc
and
lumentum
holdings
inc
the
stock
is
now
down
about
percent
since
its
earnings
apple
s
newest
models
such
as
the
iphone
xs
and
iphone
xr
are
proving
popular
with
its
most
loyal
fans
in
wealthy
economies
but
they
range
up
to
in
price
out
of
reach
for
many
consumers
in
less
developed
markets
apple
s
strategy
is
to
lure
those
consumers
to
its
with
older
models
at
cheaper
prices
it
has
also
emphasized
that
its
phones
are
designed
to
last
longer
than
the
competition
expanded
its
repair
options
and
crafted
its
most
recent
operating
system
update
to
speed
up
older
devices
but
chinese
smartphone
makers
have
been
packing
their
phones
with
chips
and
features
like
fingerprint
sensors
that
seek
to
attract
consumers
who
might
otherwise
give
apple
s
phones
a
look
those
manufacturers
are
increasingly
adopting
qualcomm
inc
s
most
powerful
mobile
phone
chips
said
cristiano
amon
the
head
of
chip
operations
at
the
chipmaker
which
is
locked
in
a
bitter
court
dispute
with
apple
those
phones
were
initially
sold
in
china
but
we
ve
also
seen
them
gaining
share
outside
china
especially
in
areas
such
as
india
and
europe
amon
said
on
its
home
turf
too
apple
is
facing
new
challenges
from
at
least
one
chinese
maker
oneplus
which
is
creeping
in
to
the
firm
s
traditionally
high
pricing
territory
though
the
iphone
s
processor
chip
beats
the
oneplus
in
some
speed
tests
posted
by
chip
tracking
firm
geekbench
the
oneplus
phone
has
a
contemporary
design
with
thin
bezels
around
the
display
similar
to
newer
iphone
models
after
years
of
being
available
in
the
united
states
only
via
an
online
store
and
developing
a
following
among
tech
enthusiasts
the
oneplus
is
being
carried
by
us
inc
stores
at
it
sits
between
the
iphone
and
iphone
in
terms
of
pricing
kyle
kiang
the
general
manager
for
north
america
for
oneplus
said
sales
of
the
new
model
were
percent
higher
in
the
united
states
than
for
the
previous
oneplus
released
there
although
he
did
not
disclose
absolute
unit
figures
he
said
sales
were
higher
because
of
the
relationship
