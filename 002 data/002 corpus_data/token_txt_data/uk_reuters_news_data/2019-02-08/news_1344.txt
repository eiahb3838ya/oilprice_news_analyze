moments
after
fleeing
their
home
dodging
falling
tiles
and
shattering
glass
indonesian
farmer
haji
ruslan
and
his
family
stood
in
a
field
opposite
and
watched
the
house
collapse
they
survived
unlike
others
in
the
area
who
residents
say
perished
in
sunday
s
earthquake
but
it
is
hard
to
feel
fortunate
as
they
wait
for
government
help
what
is
most
important
is
that
we
re
alive
but
we
are
out
of
hope
and
we
are
out
of
energy
ruslan
said
as
his
wife
rummaged
through
the
ruins
to
recover
anything
usable
such
as
ground
mats
pillows
and
kitchenware
the
earthquake
which
killed
more
than
people
and
drove
thousands
of
tourists
to
leave
was
the
worst
on
record
to
hit
the
holiday
island
of
lombok
just
a
week
earlier
another
quake
of
magnitude
rocked
the
same
area
killing
people
the
people
of
gumantar
a
rural
hamlet
surrounded
by
fields
of
corn
and
rice
rely
on
the
generosity
of
family
and
friends
from
the
rest
of
the
island
as
well
as
volunteer
groups
to
deliver
essentials
such
as
medicines
rice
instant
noodles
and
water
like
thousands
living
in
the
farmland
and
hills
of
northern
lombok
they
camp
out
under
flimsy
tarpaulin
tents
too
rattled
by
the
huge
quake
and
continuing
aftershocks
to
sleep
indoors
most
have
nothing
to
return
to
anyway
the
road
that
winds
through
gumantar
about
minutes
drive
east
of
the
quake
s
epicentre
is
lined
with
the
rubble
of
houses
village
halls
and
schools
toppled
electricity
poles
have
left
villagers
without
power
or
mobile
phone
reception
to
communicate
with
emergency
response
teams
or
relatives
water
pipes
poke
out
of
the
ground
cracked
and
leaking
from
the
force
of
the
quake
women
sit
in
tents
by
the
roads
trying
to
ration
out
instant
noodles
and
water
playgrounds
are
a
mess
of
twisted
metal
so
children
who
would
otherwise
be
in
school
chase
each
other
around
the
fields
and
play
with
chickens
at
night
portable
generators
power
a
few
light
bulbs
shared
among
hundreds
of
evacuees
residents
speak
of
neighbours
and
family
members
who
died
in
the
disaster
but
there
is
little
emotion
in
their
voices
many
remain
in
shock
it
s
like
being
in
a
dream
i
can
t
believe
this
has
happened
and
everything
is
gone
said
suniati
who
goes
by
one
name
the
community
is
still
feeling
the
trauma
of
the
earthquake
and
now
the
some
residents
like
ruslan
are
already
to
clear
up
the
debris
with
their
bare
hands
other
men
in
the
village
use
sledgehammers
and
ropes
to
bring
down
partially
toppled
walls
so
construction
can
eventually
start
anew
many
say
they
need
more
assistance
to
rebuild
their
homes
and
lives
we
don
t
know
how
to
start
over
in
the
future
and
we
hope
someone
will
help
us
