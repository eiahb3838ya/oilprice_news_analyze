end 'botched' brexit and protect jobs, corbyn says
london
reuters
jeremy
corbyn
criticised
the
government
on
tuesday
for
failing
business
with
its
botched
brexit
plan
saying
only
his
labour
party
could
make
britain
s
departure
from
the
european
union
work
for
manufacturers
unveiling
a
labour
campaign
to
boost
manufacturing
and
keep
public
contracts
in
britain
corbyn
took
aim
at
prime
minister
theresa
may
for
driving
a
brexit
plan
that
would
leave
britain
in
hock
to
donald
trump
in
a
bid
to
sell
the
benefits
of
his
brexit
vision
of
negotiating
a
new
customs
union
corbyn
piled
pressure
on
may
who
is
struggling
to
sell
her
plans
to
not
only
the
competing
factions
in
her
governing
conservative
party
but
across
britain
just
over
eight
months
before
the
country
is
due
to
leave
but
corbyn
also
faces
dissent
in
his
party
with
many
labour
mps
and
members
calling
for
him
to
back
a
second
referendum
on
any
deal
and
support
keeping
the
closest
possible
ties
with
the
eu
by
staying
in
its
single
market
and
customs
union
theresa
may
and
her
warring
cabinet
should
think
again
even
at
this
late
stage
and
reconsider
the
option
of
negotiating
a
brand
new
customs
union
corbyn
told
the
eef
manufacturers
organisation
in
the
city
of
birmingham
a
botched
brexit
will
sell
our
manufacturers
short
with
the
fantasy
of
a
free
trading
buccaneering
future
which
in
reality
would
be
a
nightmare
of
chlorinated
chicken
public
services
sold
to
multinational
companies
and
our
country
in
hock
to
donald
trump
he
said
in
a
speech
may
has
often
said
she
wants
to
forge
a
free
trade
agreement
with
president
donald
trump
after
brexit
but
some
mps
fear
the
government
could
open
the
door
to
imports
of
beef
that
contains
growth
hormones
chicken
washed
in
chlorinated
water
and
genetically
modified
organisms
the
government
has
frequently
said
it
will
not
lower
its
standards
and
will
pursue
a
brexit
but
with
its
plans
opposed
by
many
in
britain
corbyn
senses
his
vision
may
find
more
support
no
election
is
due
in
britain
until
but
labour
is
preparing
for
a
vote
aware
that
the
conservatives
are
increasingly
at
war
with
each
other
over
brexit
conservative
robert
jenrick
a
minister
at
the
finance
department
said
corbyn
s
words
were
laughable
coming
from
the
labour
party
who
oversaw
millions
of
jobs
lost
and
a
record
decline
in
manufacturing
corbyn
s
speech
build
it
in
britain
was
a
direct
appeal
for
the
backing
of
british
companies
promising
more
support
from
the
state
he
said
again
that
a
labour
government
would
pursue
exemptions
or
clarifications
on
state
aid
rules
which
prevent
countries
handing
organisations
an
advantage
by
using
state
resources
from
the
eu
something
the
bloc
may
not
agree
to
but
whatever
the
outcome
of
the
brexit
negotiations
we
will
use
the
powers
we
have
to
the
full
where
there
is
a
will
there
is
a
way
and
if
we
need
to
support
our
manufacturing
sector
we
will
find
a
way
to
do
it
he
said
highlighting
that
some
business
and
union
groups
support
trying
to
negotiate
a
new
customs
union
corbyn
went
further
to
say
he
would
also
try
to
bring
public
contracts
back
labour
will
reprogramme
our
economy
so
that
it
works
for
the
people
of
britain
and
not
against
them
he
said
and
we
will
build
this
economy
this
future
fair
for
all
right
