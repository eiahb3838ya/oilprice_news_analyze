washington
reuters
brett
kavanaugh
president
donald
trump
s
supreme
court
nominee
embraced
judicial
independence
on
wednesday
but
sidestepped
senate
democrats
questions
on
whether
a
president
can
pardon
himself
or
fire
a
prosecutor
investigating
him
kavanaugh
faced
a
grueling
session
of
more
than
hours
of
questioning
before
a
senate
panel
that
was
disrupted
repeatedly
by
shouting
protesters
senators
pressed
the
conservative
federal
appeals
court
judge
on
his
views
about
presidential
power
abortion
gun
rights
and
race
issues
all
four
issues
deeply
divide
americans
and
could
come
before
the
supreme
court
with
kavanaugh
likely
to
tip
the
court
in
an
even
more
conservative
direction
kavanaugh
signalled
respect
for
the
landmark
roe
wade
supreme
court
ruling
legalizing
abortion
nationwide
calling
it
an
important
legal
precedent
that
had
been
reaffirmed
by
the
justices
over
the
decades
he
condemned
the
spate
of
school
shootings
but
defended
an
opinion
he
wrote
questioning
whether
rifles
could
be
banned
he
also
defended
his
record
on
race
issues
senate
democrats
have
vowed
a
fierce
fight
to
block
kavanaugh
s
nomination
however
with
trump
s
fellow
republicans
holding
a
slim
senate
majority
and
no
sign
of
defections
in
republican
ranks
it
remains
likely
kavanaugh
will
be
confirmed
to
the
lifetime
job
on
the
top
judicial
body
with
trump
s
presidency
clouded
by
a
widening
probe
into
russian
election
meddling
kavanaugh
declined
to
pledge
to
step
aside
from
any
cases
that
might
come
before
the
court
involving
trump
s
conduct
kavanaugh
said
in
reply
to
a
question
from
democratic
senator
richard
blumenthal
he
could
not
commit
to
recusing
himself
from
any
cases
involving
investigations
or
civil
lawsuits
relating
to
the
president
to
be
consistent
with
the
principle
of
the
independence
of
the
judiciary
i
should
not
and
may
not
make
a
commitment
about
how
i
would
handle
a
particular
case
kavanaugh
said
trump
has
often
criticized
the
judiciary
some
liberals
have
expressed
concern
kavanaugh
could
be
a
rubber
stamp
for
trump
and
protect
him
from
lawsuits
and
investigations
asked
by
judiciary
committee
chairman
chuck
grassley
a
republican
whether
he
would
have
any
trouble
ruling
against
trump
or
the
executive
branch
kavanaugh
replied
no
one
is
above
the
law
in
our
constitutional
i
think
the
first
quality
of
a
good
judge
in
our
constitutional
system
is
independence
kavanaugh
said
kavanaugh
dodged
democratic
senator
dianne
feinstein
s
question
about
whether
a
sitting
president
can
be
required
to
respond
to
a
subpoena
a
query
that
could
come
into
play
as
special
counsel
robert
mueller
investigates
potential
collusion
between
trump
s
presidential
campaign
and
russia
i
can
t
give
you
an
answer
on
that
hypothetical
question
kavanaugh
said
he
sidestepped
democratic
senator
christopher
coons
query
on
whether
he
still
believed
as
he
wrote
years
ago
that
a
president
could
fire
a
special
prosecutor
investigating
him
all
i
can
say
is
that
was
my
view
in
kavanaugh
said
he
also
avoided
democratic
senator
patrick
leahy
s
question
about
whether
a
president
could
pardon
himself
or
someone
else
in
exchange
for
a
promise
not
to
testify
against
him
trump
claimed
in
a
twitter
post
in
june
the
absolute
right
to
pardon
kavanaugh
said
the
question
of
is
something
i
have
never
in
citing
examples
of
judicial
independence
kavanaugh
lauded
a
ruling
that
ordered
president
richard
nixon
to
hand
over
subpoenaed
materials
during
the
watergate
scandal
and
a
supreme
court
ruling
that
ended
racial
segregation
in
public
schools
feinstein
asked
kavanaugh
about
his
article
that
concluded
sitting
presidents
should
be
free
from
the
distractions
of
civil
lawsuits
criminal
prosecutions
and
investigations
kavanaugh
promised
a
completely
open
mind
if
such
issues
came
before
him
as
a
supreme
court
justice
trump
told
reporters
at
the
white
house
he
was
pleased
with
the
hearing
and
said
the
other
side
is
grasping
at
liberals
are
concerned
kavanaugh
could
provide
a
decisive
fifth
vote
on
the
court
to
overturn
the
abortion
ruling
kavanaugh
called
the
roe
wade
decision
an
important
precedent
of
the
supreme
court
that
has
been
reaffirmed
many
he
highlighted
the
planned
parenthood
casey
ruling
that
reaffirmed
roe
calling
it
a
precedent
on
while
stopping
short
of
saying
the
roe
case
correctly
decided
kavanaugh
s
remarks
suggested
he
might
be
cautious
toward
overturning
it
but
that
may
not
preclude
him
from
joining
the
court
s
other
conservatives
in
restricting
its
scope
by
upholding
abortion
restrictions
enacted
in
conservative
states
pressed
by
democratic
senator
dick
durbin
kavanaugh
defended
a
ruling
he
took
part
in
that
issued
an
order
preventing
a
illegal
immigrant
detained
by
authorities
in
texas
from
immediately
having
an
abortion
the
ruling
was
later
overturned
and
she
had
the
abortion
on
gun
rights
feinstein
pressed
kavanaugh
on
his
dissent
in
an
appellate
ruling
upholding
a
district
of
columbia
gun
law
banning
rifles
kavanaugh
said
then
that
such
guns
were
covered
by
the
constitution
s
second
amendment
which
protects
the
right
to
bear
arms
of
course
the
violence
in
the
schools
is
something
we
all
detest
and
want
to
do
something
about
kavanaugh
said
responding
to
questions
from
democratic
senator
cory
booker
on
race
issues
including
promoting
diversity
in
education
kavanaugh
cited
cases
in
which
he
ruled
in
favour
of
minorities
and
his
efforts
to
hire
law
clerks
from
diverse
backgrounds
i
have
done
my
best
to
understand
the
real
world
and
apply
the
law
kavanaugh
said
trump
picked
kavanaugh
to
replace
justice
