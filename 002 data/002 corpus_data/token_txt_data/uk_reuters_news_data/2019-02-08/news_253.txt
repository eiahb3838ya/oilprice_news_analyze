a
convoy
of
nearly
trucks
rolled
through
the
southeast
english
countryside
to
britain
s
main
port
to
continental
europe
on
monday
in
a
government
for
a
potentially
chaotic
brexit
that
was
mocked
as
a
farce
by
opponents
of
the
split
prime
minister
theresa
may
is
trying
to
force
her
brexit
deal
through
parliament
but
lawmakers
are
expected
to
reject
it
if
so
business
chiefs
and
investors
fear
the
world
s
economy
will
leave
the
european
union
at
gmt
on
march
without
an
agreement
on
their
future
relationship
with
parliament
deadlocked
the
ultimate
destination
of
the
brexit
project
remains
unclear
possible
outcomes
range
from
another
referendum
on
european
union
membership
to
a
disorderly
departure
with
no
deal
may
s
government
has
repeatedly
warned
that
a
no
deal
will
lead
to
severe
economic
disruption
and
monday
s
exercise
was
part
of
preparations
to
ensure
essential
supplies
can
keep
flowing
through
dover
europe
s
busiest
ferry
port
the
transport
ministry
said
it
was
testing
manston
airfield
as
a
holding
facility
for
lorries
and
traffic
congestion
on
kent
roads
in
the
event
of
disruption
at
the
border
setting
off
from
manston
trucks
drove
the
miles
km
to
dover
and
back
again
they
then
drove
again
to
dover
hiring
the
lorries
cost
pounds
the
transport
ministry
said
the
war
game
was
criticised
by
lawmakers
as
a
waste
of
time
and
money
and
mocked
on
twitter
as
a
fake
traffic
jam
to
show
the
eu
we
are
ready
for
no
deal
britain
s
road
haulage
association
rha
said
the
trial
was
too
little
too
late
and
would
need
to
be
repeated
to
properly
the
management
of
thousands
of
lorries
less
than
a
hundred
lorries
is
a
drop
in
the
ocean
compared
to
the
more
than
that
go
to
the
channel
ports
every
day
said
charlie
elphicke
a
conservative
lawmaker
for
dover
sending
lorries
across
kent
on
a
wild
goose
chase
to
manston
airport
and
then
to
the
port
of
dover
by
small
and
winding
often
single
track
a
roads
through
kent
villages
is
not
the
right
dover
has
been
britain
s
most
important
gateway
to
europe
since
roman
times
and
the
port
now
handles
percent
of
the
united
kingdom
s
goods
trade
up
to
trucks
a
day
pass
through
with
everything
from
perishable
food
to
medicines
layla
moran
a
liberal
democrat
lawmaker
who
wants
another
referendum
on
eu
membership
said
the
truck
journey
would
not
convince
the
eu
that
britain
was
ready
for
no
deal
this
is
a
farce
moran
said
brexit
supporters
say
that
while
there
may
be
some
disruption
in
the
the
uk
will
thrive
outside
the
eu
which
they
cast
as
a
doomed
and
excessively
bureaucratic
project
dominated
by
germany
but
fear
britain
s
exit
will
hammer
the
economy
and
undermine
the
west
as
it
grapples
with
donald
trump
s
unpredictable
presidency
and
growing
assertiveness
from
russia
and
china
today
s
trial
can
not
possibly
duplicate
the
reality
of
trucks
being
held
at
manston
airport
in
the
event
of
a
brexit
the
rha
s
chief
executive
richard
burnett
said
in
a
statement
it
s
too
little
too
late
this
process
should
have
started
nine
months
ago
at
this
late
stage
it
looks
like
window
facing
defeat
in
parliament
last
month
may
postponed
a
vote
on
the
withdrawal
agreement
she
negotiated
with
the
eu
and
pledged
to
seek
further
political
and
legal
assurances
from
the
bloc
the
eu
has
signalled
it
may
try
to
allay
the
fears
of
may
s
critics
but
will
not
renegotiate
the
deal
may
said
on
sunday
that
britain
would
be
in
uncharted
territory
if
her
brexit
deal
is
rejected
by
parliament
a
vote
is
due
around
it
s
still
hard
to
see
any
upside
to
brexit
said
mike
hawes
chief
executive
of
the
society
of
motor
manufacturers
and
traders
smmt
which
said
new
car
sales
in
fell
at
their
fastest
rate
since
the
global
financial
crisis
a
decade
ago
everyone
recognises
that
brexit
is
an
existential
threat
to
the
uk
automotive
industry
and
we
hope
a
practical
solution
will
prevail
he
said
calling
for
lawmakers
to
support
may
s
deal
to
guarantee
a
transition
period
britain
s
main
opposition
labour
party
is
expected
to
back
a
proposal
on
tuesday
that
could
mean
the
government
needs
parliamentary
approval
for
a
brexit
the
european
commission
repeated
on
monday
that
eu
leaders
would
not
renegotiate
the
brexit
deal
agreed
with
may
who
said
she
was
seeking
further
assurances
from
brussels
on
the
deal
the
deal
that
is
on
the
table
is
the
best
and
the
only
deal
possible
chief
spokesman
margaritis
schinas
told
reporters
when
asked
about
a
phone
conversation
on
friday
between
may
and
commission
president
juncker
this
deal
will
not
be
