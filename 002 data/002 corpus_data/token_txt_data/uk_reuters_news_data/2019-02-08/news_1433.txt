to
washington
for
an
autumn
meeting
a
daring
rebuttal
to
fierce
criticism
over
their
summit
in

which
he
appeared
to
give
credence
to
the
russian
leader
s
assertion
that
moscow
did
not
interfere
in
the
presidential
election
the
invitation
sparked
a
new
outcry
including
from
lawmakers
in
trump
s
republican
party
who
argued
that
putin
is
an
adversary
not
worthy
of
a
white
house
visit
and
that
they
still
did
not
know
what
the
leaders
had
discussed
during
their
meeting
the
president
believes
that
the
next
bilateral
meeting
with
president
putin
should
take
place
after
the
russia
witch
hunt
is
over
so
we
ve
agreed
that
it
will
be
after
the
first
of
the
year
bolton
said
in
a
statement
intelligence
agencies
have
concluded
that
moscow
interfered
to
sway
the
vote
towards
trump
and
special
counsel
robert
mueller
is
investigating
whether
trump
s
campaign
worked
with
the
russians
trump
rejected
the
criticism
sparked
by
his
helsinki
news
conference
with
putin
and
said
he
misspoke
in
a
series
of
over
the
summit
he
then
abruptly
issued
the
invitation
to
putin
reflecting
the
unease
among
lawmakers
house
of
representatives
speaker
paul
ryan
and
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell

on
tuesday
that
putin
would
not
be
invited
to
address
congress
or
visit
the
capitol
if
he
accepted
trump
s
invitation
the
kremlin
said
this
week
that
although
washington
and
moscow
agreed
there
was
a
need
for
another
meeting
russia
had
not
yet
begun
any
practical
preparations
for
a

there
are
other
options

our
leaders
can
look
at
