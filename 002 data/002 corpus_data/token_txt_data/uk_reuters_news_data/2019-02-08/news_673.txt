we

is
organised
and
the

did
not
respond
to

questions
put
this

the
club
said
in
an
april
response
to
uefa
investigators
about
sponsorship
that
it
had
complied
with
the
rules
and
adopted
a
good
faith
and
correct
interpretation
of
the
uefa
said
in
an
emailed
response
to

that
it
could
not
comment
on
specific
cases
due
to
confidentiality
obligations
the
uefa
control
body
chairman
declined
to
comment
citing
confidentiality
obligations
in
an
overall
statement
about
the
financial
fair
play
rules
uefa
said
the
rules
were
there
to
help
clubs
become
financially
sustainable
and
it
was
very
satisfied
with
how
they
had
been
applied
and
the
results
achieved
noting
an
improvement
in
the
finances
of
european
soccer
clubs
no
system
is
perfect
but
on
the
whole
ffp
the
financial
fair
play
regime
has
increasingly
protected
european
football
from
financial
difficulty
since
its
introduction
in
uefa
said
the
documents
provide
insight
into
the
nature
of
the
huge
sums
flowing
through
man
city
and
could
supercharge
one
of
the
biggest
controversies
in
soccer
some
rivals
have
alleged
that
man
city
has
benefited
unfairly
from
the
financial
firepower
of
its
gulf
owner
the
club
has
rejected
those
claims
the
issue
is
of
interest
to
millions
of
fans
who
pay
to
support
soccer
teams
man
city
s
arrangements
for
boosting
income
from

and
offloading
some
costs
formed
part
of
a
programme
termed

longbow
by
executives
according
to
club
presentations
and
emails
between
managers
it
is
unclear
from
the
emails
reviewed
by

whether
sheikh
mansour
was
aware
of
the
arrangements
nor
do

man

deceive
uefa

and
accounting

said
the
sponsors
and
other
counterparties
in
the
transactions
with
man
city
in
all
likelihood
did
not
break
any
rules
because
their
shareholders
were
not
disadvantaged
by
the
arrangements
and
because
the
amounts
were
likely
not
material
enough
to
require
detailed
disclosure
to

or
the

a
spokesperson
for
etihad
airways
said
in
a
statement
the
airline
s
financial
obligations
associated
with
the
partnership
of
the
club
and
the
broader
city
football
group
have
always
been
and
remain
the
sole

and

of

the
spokesperson
added
our
partnership
with

the

continues
to
deliver
important
ongoing
and
accumulative
returns
on
our
etisalat
is
a
telecoms
company
headquartered
in
abu
dhabi
a
spokesman
for
the
company
said
in
a
statement
that
football
had
become
a
highly
competitive
market
for
sponsors
and
that
we
believe
that
etisalat
has
delivered
excellent
returns
from
its
investments
in
this
he
added
as
a
publicly
listed
company
etisalat
is
driven
to
create
returns
for
its
shareholders
in
all
of
its
investments
including
our
commercial
tobias
troeger
a
professor
of
law
at
goethe
university
frankfurt
said
the
directors
of
sponsoring
companies
would
not
be
breaking
their
fiduciary
duty
to
their
shareholders
if
they
paid
over
the
odds
for
a
sponsorship
contract
providing
the
overpayment
was
covered
by
another
party
and
the
directors
believed
the
overall
transaction
was
in
the
best
interests
of
the
company
and
its
investors
in
other
words
if
the
payments
from
sheikh
mansour
s
adug
were
covering
any
potential
overvaluation
of
man
city
s
sponsorship
deals
there
would
be
no
loss
to
the
sponsors
shareholders
all
the
jurisdictions
we
re
talking
about
have
a
business
judgement
rule
so
executives
can
essentially
determine
without
being
held
liable
how
they
want
to
pursue
the
corporate
interest
if
it
s
a
reasonable
judgement
they
make
with
sound
information
troeger
said
provided
all
the
payments
were
recorded
correctly
in
the
accounts
there
would
likely
be
no
breaches
of
corporate
reporting
rules
he
added
luca
enriques
professor
of
corporate
law
at
the
university
of
oxford
said
that
while
a
football
club
might
be
bound
by
uefa
s
rules
the
club
s
sponsors
or
business
partners
would
not
have
any
legal
obligation
to
follow
the
governing
body
s
rules
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
put
third
parties
under
the
domain
of
football
rules
he
said
widdowson
man
city
s
head
of
finance
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
on
what
was
meant
by
funds
being
routed
through
sponsors
another
strand
of
project
longbow
focused
on
a
quirk
in
how
top
players
are
paid
known
as
image
leading
clubs
in
britain
and
some
other
european
countries
often
declare
that
around
percent
of
what
they
pay
players
is
for
the
right
to
use
their
images
for
marketing
man
city
decided
to
sell
those
rights
to
a
new
company
it
created
receiving
million
pounds
and
shifting
costs
of
around
million
pounds
a
year
off
its
books
the
manoeuvre
would
have
the
double
benefit
of
boosting
the
club
s
income
and
reducing
its
expenses
so
on
may
man
city
sold
its
top
players
image
rights
to
its
new
company
called
manchester
city
football
club
image
rights
ltd
and
known
as
mir
on
the
same
day
the
club
then
sold
mir
to
fordham
sports
management
according
to
the
documents
fordham
sports

ultimately
owned
by
david
rowland
a
british
financier
based
in
guernsey
according
to
publicly
available
financial
filings
rowland
did
not
respond
to
requests

mir
had
agreed
to
pay
man
city
million
pounds
and
to
take
on
costs
of
over
million
pounds
a
year
in
return
it
received
the
right
to
sell
the
players
images
but
only
under
restricted
terms
existing
sponsorship
contracts
between
marketers
and
players
were
excluded
and
mir
did
not
receive
the
right
to
use
the
players
images
in
association
with
club
logos
or
colours
also
in
some
cases
mir
s
contracts
required
it
to
share
any
revenue
it
generated
with
the
players
in
the
following
years

began
to
rack
up
large
losses
more
than

its

there
would
be
nothing

about

required

to
take

more
than
million
pounds
in

rights
payments
a
year
the
evidence
submitted
by

did
not
provide
the
necessary
comfort
about
the
economic
rationale
of
the
transactions
the
letter
said
uefa

did
not
say
in
the
letter
that
man
city
had
intended
to
evade
its
financial

or
deceive
it
uefa

ultimately
did
allow

to
retain
the
benefit
of
the
million
pounds
it
received
for
selling
the
rights
uefa
s
control
body
did
not
disclose
the
reasons
for
that
decision
the
million
boost
to
its
income
helped
the

comply
with

limiting
the
amount
of
losses
clubs
can
incur
according
to
letters
and
emails
between
uefa
s
control
body
and
the
club
and
correspondence
between
club
executives
uefa
investigators
also
challenged
some
of
man
city
s
accounting
of
sponsorship
income
questioning
whether
the
arrangements
conformed
with
the
rules
on
financial
fair
play
as
reuters
outlined
on
documents
reported
here
show
uefa
investigators
said
that
two
abu

sponsors
state
investment
firm
aabar
and
telecom
firm
etisalat
were
parties
related
to
man
city
s
owners
under
financial
fair
play
rules
such
sponsorship
deals
had
to
be
recorded
at
fair
market
value
when
calculating
whether
the
club
had
broken
even
or
not
but
independent
experts
hired
by
uefa
said
the
contracts
were
at
rates
uefa
investigators
said
the
aabar
contract
had
a
fair
value
of
million
euros
million
according
to
a
preliminary
view
report
but
the
sponsor
was
paying
million
euros
the
etisalat
sponsorship
rights
were
estimated
to
have
a
fair
value
of
million
euros
a
year
but
the
sponsor
was
paying
million
euros
a
year
uefa
investigators
in
the
may
preliminary
view
report
also
noted
that
they
had
found
no
evidence
of
a
commercial
negotiation
over
the
deals
leading
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
not
an
arm
s
length
transaction
between
unrelated
etisalat
said
it
strove
to
create
returns
from
all
its
investments
uefa
did
not
respond
directly
to
questions
about
individual
sponsorship
deals
but
said
one
of
its
aims
was
to
encourage
clubs
to
operate
on
the
basis
of
their
own
uefa
s
control
body
declined
to
comment
for
reasons
of
confidentiality
under
the
final
settlement
uefa
s
control
body
required
adjustments
to
the
club
s
and
financial
reports
however
for
and
the
following
two
years
uefa
s
control
body
did
allow
the
club
to
recognise
the
sponsorship
contracts
at
values
that
independent
experts
had
said
were
above
market
rates
according
to
the
settlement
documents
in
other
words
in
those
years
the
sport
s
european
governing
body
allowed
man
city
to
count
far
more
income
from
sponsors
under
financial
fair
play
rules
than
uefa
s
external
experts
thought
was
appropriate
