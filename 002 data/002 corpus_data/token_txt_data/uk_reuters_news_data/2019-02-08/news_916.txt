about
metres
from
the
beach
north
of
the
indonesian
city
of
palu
a
wooden
home
is
rising
in
the
midst
of
a
wasteland
of
concrete
mangled
sheets
of
iron
and
uprooted
trees
in
the
absence
of
help
survivors
of
last
friday
s
quake
and
a
devastating
tsunami
minutes
later
are
helping
themselves
with
a
mix
of
stoicism
and
fatalism
picking
through
debris
to
construct
homes
and
rescue
household
items
two
brothers
nanang
and
eko
joko
are
busy
nailing
planks
of
salvaged
timber
in
the
hammering
heat
i
was
born
here
and
it
is
better
to
die
here
said
eko
a
furniture
maker
standing
near
three
wrecked
sewing
machines
that
once
upholstered
sofas
in
a
nearby
workshop
the
magnitude
earthquake
triggered
a
devastating
tsunami
three
waves
in
only
a
few
minutes
that
levelled
much
of
the
coastline
for
km
miles
north
of
palu
inland
the
tremor
destroyed
homes
while
liquefied
soil
sucked
up
entire
villages
according
to
indonesia
s
disaster
mitigation
agency
people
have
died
more
than
have
been
injured
and
homes
damaged
there
are
internally
displaced
people
at
sites
in
the
centre
of
palu
tent
cities
are
starting
to
appear
though
further
away
aid
has
been
slow
to
arrive
and
evacuation
centres
are
still
being
constructed
an
assessment
from
the
asean
humanitarian
assistance
centre
reviewed
by
reuters
said
people
had
urgent
needs
including
children
and
elderly
where
else
can
we
build
who
will
give
us
the
money
to
buy
land
elsewhere
said
eko
besides
the
evacuation
centres
are
not
the
makeshift
house
will
shelter
ten
people
as
the
construction
continues
male
members
of
the
community
are
staying
in
the
teetering
ruins
of
their
former
homes
some
of
them
shorn
in
half
within
minutes
of
the
earthquake
as
people
gathered
outside
their
homes
the
men
said
they
heard
a
loud
noise
like
rolling
thunder
our
home
withstood
the
earthquake
but
the
tsunami
was
too
much
the
wave
was
half
as
high
as
that
said
nanang
pointing
to
a
telecommunications
tower
residents
ran
as
far
and
as
fast
as
they
could
after
hearing
the
roar
of
the
ocean
but
about
of
the
roughly
residents
in
the
neighbourhood
were
killed
the
men
said
on
thursday
four
bodies
were
recovered
a
short
distance
from
the
emerging
home
while
the
government
has
helped
recover
some
bodies
and
cleared
the
road
the
area
has
received
no
other
help
the
men
said
we
will
start
again
here
ourselves
because
god
does
not
strike
twice
said
eko
we
can
reinforce
as
much
as
we
want
we
could
build
dykes
but
how
tall
are
we
going
to
build
them
how
can
we
withstand
the
forces
of
nature
