by

not
exempt

was

ryanair
said
that
it
believed
that
compensation
was
not
payable
in
the
case
of
strikes
courts
in
germany
spain
and
italy
have
already
ruled
that
strikes
are
an
extraordinary
circumstance
and
compensation
does
not
apply
we
expect
the
uk
caa
and
courts
will
follow
this
precedent
a
spokesman
for
ryanair
said
enforcement
action
is
when
the
caa
seeks
legal
undertakings
from
operators
to
ensure
they
change
their
policies
and
comply
with
the
law
