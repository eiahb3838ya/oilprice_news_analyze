pound to bounce 5.5 percent if brexit deal struck - reuters poll
london
reuters
sterling
will
rise
around
percent
against
the
dollar
if
britain
and
the
european
union
agree
a
divorce
deal
a
reuters
poll
found
but
will
sink
more
than
percent
if
no
agreement
is
reached
as
predicted
in
numerous
reuters
fx
polls
ahead
of
the
june
referendum
when
britons
shocked
markets
by
voting
to
part
ways
with
the
eu
cable
is
down
about
percent
since
then
and
was
trading
around
on
wednesday
with
less
than
five
months
until
the
marriage
is
due
to
end
the
two
sides
have
yet
to
finalise
a
divorce
settlement
and
if
none
is
made
by
the
end
of
march
sterling
will
fall
to
the
poll
found
however
economists
polled
by
reuters
last
month
said
there
was
only
a
chance
of
a
disorderly
brexit
where
no
deal
is
reached
and
thursday
s
poll
of
foreign
exchange
strategists
said
the
pound
would
bounce
to
if
a
deal
is
made
our
central
forecasts
are
based
on
the
expectation
that
there
is
a
deal
said
ryan
djajasaputra
at
investec
if
you
look
at
sterling
there
is
a
significant
brexit
risk
premium
embedded
within
the
currency
and
should
you
get
a
deal
you
see
that
effectively
however
traders
hold
a
more
negative
view
on
the
outlook
for
the
pound
than
at
any
time
since
shortly
after
the
brexit
referendum
according
to
options
markets
as
fears
grow
that
britain
is
headed
for
a
disruptive
exit
from
the
eu
medians
in
the
wider
oct
poll
of
strategists
pegged
sterling
at
in
a
month
at
the
end
of
april
a
month
after
britain
leaves
the
eu
and
in
a
year
those
forecasts
are
little
changed
from
an
october
poll
but
the
horizon
range
is
slightly
wider
reflecting
the
ongoing
uncertainty
among
speculators
ahead
of
the
divorce
date
adding
to
downward
pressure
on
the
pound
the
bank
of
england
is
not
expected
to
raise
interest
rates
again
until
after
brexit
in
contrast
the
united
states
federal
reserve
is
expected
to
raise
borrowing
costs
again
in
december
and
follow
that
up
with
three
more
increases
next
year
while
the
european
central
bank
is
expected
to
end
its
asset
purchases
programme
in
december
it
won
t
start
tinkering
with
record
low
interest
rates
until
after
june
so
against
the
euro
the
pound
is
expected
to
move
little
it
was
around
pence
on
wednesday
and
will
be
at
in
a
month
the
poll
said
in
six
months
the
pound
will
have
strengthened
marginally
to
and
be
at
in
a
year
