a
moment
many
californians
have
come
to
dread
seeing
smoke
from
one

increasingly
devastating
wildfires
approaching
and
knowing
they
may
soon
be
forced
to

their
homes
perhaps
forever
for
residents
of
the
los
angeles
suburb
of
thousand
oaks

moment
came
at
the
end
of
a
week

a
combat
veteran
entered
a
local

killed
a
dozen
people
in
the
kind
of
mass
shooting
that
has
become
increasingly
commonplace
