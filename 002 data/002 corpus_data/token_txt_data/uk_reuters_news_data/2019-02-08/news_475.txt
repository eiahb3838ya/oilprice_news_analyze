reuters
britain
will
not
use
the
european
union
s
galileo
space
project
for
defence
or
critical
national
infrastructure
after
brexit
prime
minister
theresa
may
said
on
friday
a
row
over
galileo
which
the
bloc
is
developing
to
rival
the
global
positioning
system
erupted
earlier
this
year
when
london
accused
the
eu
of
shutting
british
businesses
out
of
the
project
before
britain
s
exit
next
march
the
eu
has
said
its
rules
prohibit
it
sharing
sensitive
security
information
with
countries
outside
the
bloc
britain
will
explore
options
to
build
its
own
global
navigation
satellite
system
to
help
guide
military
drones
run
energy
networks
and
provide
essential
services
for
civilian
smart
phones
may
s
office
said
it
will
also
work
with
the
united
states
to
continue
accessing
its
gps
system
i
have
been
clear
from
the
outset
that
the
uk
will
remain
firmly
committed
to
europe
s
collective
security
after
brexit
may
who
is
attending
the
summit
in
argentina
said
in
a
statement
but
given
the
commission
s
decision
to
bar
the
uk
from
being
fully
involved
in
developing
all
aspects
of
galileo
it
is
only
right
that
we
find
britain
told
the
eu
earlier
this
year
it
would
demand
the
repayment
of
up
to
billion
pounds
if
the
bloc
restricted
its
access
to
galileo
a
senior
british
official
said
the
question
of
past
contributions
was
still
a
live
issue
which
would
be
discussed
as
part
of
talks
on
britain
s
future
relationship
with
the
bloc
in
august
britain
said
its
uk
space
agency
with
support
from
the
ministry
of
defence
would
start
work
on
an
alternative
satellite
system
to
galileo
to
ensure
its
national
security
if
it
were
barred
from
equal
access
to
the
eu
programme
after
brexit
setting
aside
million
pounds
for
it
i
can
not
let
our
armed
services
depend
on
a
system
that
we
can
not
be
sure
of
that
would
not
be
in
our
national
interest
may
said
may
s
office
said
britain
s
overseas
territories
and
crown
dependencies
would
be
used
to
provide
a
global
network
of
locations
needed
for
the
infrastructure
and
worldwide
coverage
