msps
to
remotely
manage

and

unsealed

technology
firms
or

any
affected
clients
the
sources
who
were
not
authorized
to
comment
on
confidential
information
gleaned
from
investigations
into
the
hacks
said
that
hpe
and
ibm
were
not
the
only
prominent
technology
companies
whose
networks
had
been
compromised
by
cloudhopper
cloudhopper
which
has
been
targeting
technology
services
providers
for
several
years
infiltrated
the
networks
of
hpe
and
ibm
multiple
times
in
breaches
that
lasted
for
weeks
and
months
according
to
another
of
the
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
ibm
investigated
an
attack
as
recently
as
this
summer
and
hpe
conducted
a
large
breach
investigation
in
early
the
source
said
the
attackers
were
persistent
making
it
difficult
to
ensure
that
networks
were
safe
said
another
source
ibm
has
dealt
with
some
infections
by
installing
new
hard
drives
and
fresh
operating
systems
on
infected
computers
said
the
person
familiar
with
the
effort
cloudhopper
attacks
date
back
to
at
least
according
the
indictment
the
indictment
cited
one
case
in
which
cloudhopper
compromised
data
of
an
msp
in
new
york
state
and
clients
in
countries
including
brazil
germany
india
japan
the
united
arab
emirates
britain
and
the
united
states
they
were
from
industries
including
finance
electronics
medical
equipment
biotechnology
automotive
mining
and
oil
and
gas
exploration
one
senior
intelligence
official
who
declined
to
name
any
victims
who
were
breached
said
attacks
on
msps
were
a
significant
threat
because
they
essentially
turned
technology
companies
into
launchpads
for
hacks
on
clients
by
gaining
access
to
an
msp
you
can
in
many
cases
gain
access
to
any
one
of
their
customers
said
the
official
call
it
the
walmart
approach
if
i
needed
to
get
different
items
for
my
shopping
list
i
could
go
to
different
stores
or
i
could
go
to
the
one
that
has
representatives
with
the
fbi
and
department
of
homeland
security
declined
to
comment
officials
with
the
justice
department
and
the
chinese
embassy
in
washington
could
not
be
reached
a
british
government
spokeswoman
declined
to
comment
on
the
identities
of
companies
affected
by
the
cloudhopper
campaign
or
the
impact
of
those
breaches
a
number
of
msps
have
been
affected
and
naming
them
would
have
potential
commercial
consequences
for
them
putting
them
at
an
unfair
disadvantage
to
their
competitors
