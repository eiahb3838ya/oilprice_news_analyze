eu parliament pushes hungary sanctions over orban policies
strasbourg
reuters
the
european
parliament
voted
on
wednesday
to
sanction
hungary
for
flouting
eu
rules
on
democracy
civil
rights
and
corruption
in
an
unprecedented
step
that
left
prime
minister
viktor
orban
isolated
from
powerful
allies
hungary
said
it
would
seek
legal
ways
to
challenge
the
vote
it
described
as
petty
revenge
delivering
more
than
the
majority
required
as
many
of
orban
s
allies
in
the
conservative
party
deserted
him
the
vote
however
has
little
chance
of
ending
up
with
the
ultimate
penalty
of
hungary
being
suspended
from
voting
in
the
eu
if
nothing
else
its
polish
ally
would
veto
that
but
the
votes
cast
against
the
parliament
s
first
bid
to
launch
the
punitive
process
of
the
eu
treaty
s
article
highlighted
the
substantial
minority
of
european
opinion
who
see
orban
as
a
crusader
for
the
rights
of
nation
states
and
ethnic
majorities
against

behaviour
agreed
in
brussels
since

has
used
his
parliamentary
majority
to
pressure
courts
media
and
groups
in
ways
his
opponents
say
breach
eu
rules
he
has
also
led
opposition
to
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
and
others
who
want
europe
to
take
in
more
muslim
refugees
today
s
european
parliament
decision
was
nothing
else
but
a
petty
revenge
of
politicians
against
hungary
foreign
minister
peter
szijjarto
told
a
news
conference
in
budapest
the
decision
was
made
in
a
fraudulent
way
and
contrary
to
relevant
rules
in
european
as
abstaining
votes
had
not
been
counted
he
said
that
changed
the
outcome
of

after
the

viktor
orban
s
government
has
been
leading
the
charge
against
european
values
by
silencing
independent
media
replacing
critical
judges
and
putting
academia
on
a
leash
individuals
