trump is right, jobs for black americans abound. here's why it may not last
memphis
reuters
ask
memphis
residents
and
they
might
say
that
president
donald
trump
got
this
one
right
this
is
the
best
job
market
as
far
as
many
in
this
majority
black
city
can
remember
for
single
mother
latasha
harwell
it
has
meant
finally
landing
a
full
time
job
as
a
medical
assistant
one
with
the
regular
to
hours
she
needs
so
she
can
care
for
her

an
hour
more
for
switching
employers
unemployment
in
memphis
hit
a
low
of
percent
in
april
it
has
since
crept
back
above
percent
though
partly
because
of
more
people
joining
the
labor
force
but
with
poverty
rates
here
still
among
the
highest
in
the
country
workers
employment
advocates
and
government
officials
also
say
that
is
only
half
the
story
for
this
good
spell
to
truly
matter
to
black
americans
they
say
it
will
need
to
continue
for
years
to
come
trump
often
highlights
that
overall
unemployment
has
reached
a
low
on
his
watch
and
that
joblessness
among
black
americans
has
set
a
modern
record
as
well
the
unemployment
rate
for
blacks
sunk
to
percent
in
may
the
lowest
since
when
the
figure
was
first
reported
separately
but
the
milestone
reflects
a
trend
that
took
shape
years
before
trump
took
office
black
employment
has
risen
about
million
under
trump
to
hit
a
record
million
in
october
but
job
gains
were
the
strongest
during
barack
obama
s
second
term
when
recovery
from
the
great
recession
became
more
firmly
rooted
recent
data
indicate
job
gains
for
blacks
may
already
be
leveling
off
graphic
in
memphis
state
officials
job
recruiters
and
executives
credit
a
confluence
of
forces
including
a
continued
boom
in
logistics
warehousing
and
related
jobs
for
creating
what
one
employment
agency
executive
deemed
a
gold
rush
moment
graphic
yet
what
matters
for
them
is
not
who
gets
credit
for
today
s
strong
labor
market
but
whether
it
will
be
durable
enough
to
help
workers
weather
the
next
downturn
something
past
upswings
failed
to
accomplish
national
data
analyzed
by
reuters
shows
minority
hiring
has
remained
clustered
in
industries
such
as
food
service
retail
and
logistics
that
tend
to
pay
less
and
have
been
quicker
to
lay
off
staff
when
the
economy
slows
the
fear
is
that
will
repeat
itself
and
that
after
outsized
gains
during
the
upswing
relatively
more
black
workers
will
lose
their
jobs
when
leaner
times
arrive
that
is
what
happened
during
the
last
recession
when
white
unemployment
peaked
at
just
over
percent
while
black
unemployment
shot
above
percent
as
a
result
past
recoveries
have
done
little
to
narrow
the
gap
between
black
and
white
incomes
as
numerous
studies
including
recent
work
by
the
atlanta
federal
reserve
have
documented
nationally
median
incomes
for
black
families
remain
a
third
below
white
household
incomes
in
memphis
the
gap
is
even
larger
with
a
median
annual
income
for
blacks
representing
just
percent
of
that
of
white
families
it
is
a
good
thing
that
african
american
unemployment
is
at
a
very
low
level
fed
chair
jerome
powell
said
at
a
meeting
with
community
groups
in
houston
this
month
but
if
you
look
at
what
happens
in
a
downturn
you
see
the
last
people
hired
are
the
first
to
get
fired
he
said
for
that
to
change
workers
such
as
harwell
need
enough
time
to
pay
off
student
loans
get
a
raise
or
two
start
saving
for
a
home
and
gain
the
additional
skills
and
seniority
needed
to
keep
working
through
the
next
recession
this
isn
t
a
job
anymore
it
is
a
career
personally
i
say
i
need
two
years
to
feel
economically
stable
harwell
said
with
the
recovery
pushing
a
decade
and
some
signs
of
a
growth
slowdown
ahead
local
social
service
agencies
and
state
officials
say
the
time
for
is
now
we
know
it
is
not
going
to
last
forever
said
deniece
thomas
an
assistant
commissioner
at
the
tennessee
department
of
labor
and
workforce
development
there
is
a
sense
of
urgency
for
workers
to
assess
what
skills
their
employers
will
need
even
if
business
slows
she
said
to
help
them
the
state
has
made
community
college
free
for
high
school
graduates
and
adults
who
have
not
previously
earned
a
degree
one
of
the
most
expansive
efforts
in
the
country
to
encourage
educated
adults
to
improve
their
skills
other
programs
provide
certifications
for
specific
jobs
in
industries
such
as
the
booming
medical
device
field
that
are
struggling
with
labor
shortages
a
look
behind
the
headline
numbers
shows
there
is
still
ground
to
cover
the
black
unemployment
rate
far
outstrips
the
national
average
now
at
percent
and
since
reaching
that
record
low
in
may
has
crept
up
to
percent
and
above
even
as
white
unemployment
keeps
edging
lower
other
gauges
such
as
the
employment
to
population
ratio
also
lag
reuters
analysis
of
the
federal
quarterly
workforce
indicators
shows
that
out
of
five
industry
groups
where
the
share
of
jobs
held
by
blacks
grew
the
most
between
and
three
were
among
those
that
paid
the
least
three
of
those
five
were
also
among
the
industries
that
shed
the
most
jobs
during
the
last
recession
the
qwi
tracks
industry
groups
still
the
gains
are
real
overall
black
employment
has
soared
by
nearly
a
third
since
the
lows
of
late
compared
to
a
percent
increase
in
the
number
of
jobs
held
by
white
workers
according
to
federal
data
blacks
share
of
employment
has
also
been
catching
up
with
their
share
of
the
working
age
population
and
the
gap
is
now
at
a
record
low
in
memphis
where
percent
of
the
population
is
black
and
more
than
a
quarter
lives
in
poverty
compared
with
a
percent
national
average
there
is
some
optimism
that
there
may
be
more
than
just
a
cyclical
upturn
at
work
windfall
the
city
has
long
been
politically
and
culturally
important
as
a
battleground
of
the
civil
rights
movement
the
site
of
martin
luther
king
s
assassination
and
a
cornerstone
of
american
music
where
the
careers
of
elvis
presley
king
and
otis
redding
took
off
now
it
is
also
making
its
name
as
a
major
logistics
hub
a
fulcrum
of
the
internet
economy
that
hosts
fedex
s
global
headquarters
and
the
country
s
busiest
cargo
boom
is
a
game
changer
for
us
memphis
is
a
poor
city
but
logistics
is
a
way
for
a
lot
of
minorities
to
pull
themselves
into
jobs
said
neil
harris
president
of
the
prestigious
placements
recruiting
and
hiring
firm
the
firm
has
more
than
workers
placed
around
memphis
area
warehouses
and
other
facilities
harris
said
that
firms
were
so
keen
to
fill
vacancies
that
they
were
relaxing
demands
for
prior
experience
raising
pay
offering
more
training
and
becoming
more
flexible
in
scheduling
fedex
s
presence
has
led
others
to
invest
in
this
corner
of
western
tennessee
including
inc
which
is
expected
to
hire
for
distribution
facilities
near
memphis
along
with
at
the
facility
it
announced
in
nashville
earlier
this
month
in
all
employment
in
transportation
and
warehousing
in
memphis
climbed
to
more
than
last
year
from
around
in
with
more
than
half
the
new
jobs
going
to
blacks
as
of
the
end
of
october
fedex
alone
had
about
vacancies
posted
on
the
tennessee
department
of
labor
s
job
site
the
question
is
how
long
it
can
all
last
reid
dulberger
president
of
edge
a
memphis
economic
development
group
said
he
was
worried
that
automation
will
eventually
eliminate
many
of
the
brawn
jobs
giants
such
as
fedex
and
amazon
now
rely
on
to
move
tens
of
millions
of
packages
in
their
warehouses
for
now
though
forklifts
still
need
drivers
and
that
demand
gave
jefferson
confidence
to
give
two
weeks
notice
at
the
warehouse
paying
him
an
hour
to
move
to
one
that
pays
the
years
during
and
after
the
last
recession
were
hard
the
said
with
work
more
difficult
to
find
and
mostly
coming
through
temp
agencies
those
were
years
spent
bouncing
among
warehousing
fast
food
janitorial
jefferson
said
but
now
a
lot
of
opportunities
have
opened
up
and
jefferson
said
his
aim
is
to
build
the
experience
needed
to
be
brought
on
