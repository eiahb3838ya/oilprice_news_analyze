in oval office speech, trump demands a wall but does not declare emergency
washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
urged
congress
in
a
televised
speech
on
tuesday
to
give
him
billion
billion
pounds
this
year
to
help
build
a
wall
on
the
border
with
mexico
but
stopped
short
of
declaring
a
national
emergency
to
pay
for
the
barrier
with
military
funds
facing
democratic
opposition
in
congress
to
a
wall
that
he
promised
to
build
as
a
presidential
candidate
trump
said
in
his
first
address
from
the
oval
office
that
there
was
a
growing
security
and
humanitarian
crisis
at
the
border
using
blunt
language
in
an
attempt
to
win
public
support
the
republican
president
said
illegal
immigrants
and
drugs
flowing
across
the
southern
border
posed
a
serious
threat
to
american
safety
how
much
more
american
blood
must
be
shed
before
congress
does
its
job
he
said
recounting
gruesome
details
of
murders
he
said
were
committed
by
illegal
immigrants
but
after
days
of
hinting
he
might
use
presidential
powers
to
declare
an
emergency
as
a
first
step
towards
directing
money
for
the
wall
without
congressional
approval
trump
said
he
would
continue
seeking
a
solution
to
the
impasse
with
congress
trump
s
speech
came
days
into
a
partial
government
shutdown
precipitated
by
his
demand
for
the
wall
public
opposition
to
the
shutdown
is
growing
and
that
could
hurt
trump
as
he
said
last
month
he
would
be
proud
to
close
the
government
to
fight
for
the
wall
democratic
leaders
in
a
rebuttal
also
carried
live
on
national
television
accused
the
president
on
tuesday
night
of
using
fear
tactics
and
spreading
misinformation
about
the
situation
along
the
border
the
president
has
chosen
fear
we
want
to
start
with
the
facts
said
nancy
pelosi
democratic
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
fact
is
president
trump
has
chosen
to
hold
hostage
critical
services
for
the
health
safety
and
of
the
american
people
and
withhold
the
paychecks
of
innocent
workers
across
the
nation
many
of
them
veterans
she
said
a
poll
released
on
tuesday
found
that
percent
of
adults
mainly
blamed
trump
for
the
shutdown
up
percentage
points
from
late
december
while
percent
blamed
congressional
democrats
and
percent
faulted
republicans
in
congress
republican
lawmakers
have
increasingly
expressed
concerns
about
trump
s
handling
of
the
dispute
but
he
has
shown
no
signs
of
giving
up
he
is
scheduled
to
visit
the
southwest
border
on
thursday
and
may
still
choose
to
make
the
national
emergency
declaration
vice
president
mike
pence
told
reporters
on
monday
the
president
was
considering
the
possibility
and
the
white
house
counsel
s
office
was
studying
its
legality
democrats
and
other
opponents
of
a
wall
have
threatened
to
take
legal
action
if
trump
issues
an
emergency
order
they
say
he
is
manufacturing
a
crisis
in
a
bid
to
meet
his
presidential
campaign
promise
for
a
wall
that
he
said
at
the
time
would
be
paid
for
by
mexico
the
mexican
government
has
refused
to
provide
such
funds
trump
was
to
meet
at
the
white
house
on
wednesday
with
democratic
and
republican
congressional
leaders
politics
coloured
the
remarks
from
both
sides
on
tuesday
trump
said
and
hispanics
were
especially
hard
hit
by
the
border
crisis
both
groups
are
key
democratic
constituencies
pelosi
pointedly
mentioned
that
veterans
were
hurt
by
the
shutdown
trump
has
courted
veterans
as
a
candidate
and
as
president
trump
at
times
tried
to
adopt
a
softer
tone
this
is
a
humanitarian
crisis
a
crisis
of
the
heart
and
a
crisis
of
the
soul
he
said
suggesting
that
women
and
children
were
among
the
migrants
often
victimized
by
trafficking
across
the
border
hoping
to
demonstrate
flexibility
during
his
nearly
speech
trump
said
of
the
border
barrier
he
wants
built
at
the
request
of
the
democrats
it
will
be
a
steel
barrier
and
not
a
concrete
but
democrats
have
opposed
not
just
the
construction
materials
to
be
used
but
the
extent
of
a
project
that
could
end
up
costing
more
than
billion
over
the
long
run
democrats
also
argue
that
a
mix
of
fencing
which
already
has
been
constructed
in
many
parts
of
the
border
and
tools
would
be
cheaper
and
more
effective
in
securing
the
border
pelosi
said
trump
rejected
bipartisan
legislation
to
reopen
the
government
agencies
shuttered
as
a
result
of
the
fight
over
the
wall
and
that
he
was
obsessed
with
forcing
american
taxpayers
to
waste
billions
of
dollars
on
an
expensive
and
ineffective
she
has
previously
called
the
wall
immoral
trump
took
issue
with
that
in
his
speech
the
only
thing
that
is
immoral
is
the
politicians
to
do
nothing
and
continue
to
allow
more
innocent
people
to
be
so
horribly
victimized
he
said
senate
democratic
leader
chuck
schumer
who
delivered
a
rebuttal
along
with
pelosi
urged
the
president
to
reopen
the
government
while
the
debate
over
immigration
policies
continued
the
symbol
of
america
should
be
the
statue
of
liberty
not
a
wall
he
said
so
our
suggestion
is
a
simple
one
president
reopen
the
government
and
we
can
work
to
resolve
our
differences
over
border
security
but
end
this
shutdown
