brexit hash makes britain 'hot heads' of europe - city chief
london
reuters
mismanagement
of
brexit
has
made
britain
the
new
hot
heads
of
europe
and
caused
damage
to
its
valuable
financial
services
industry
that
will
take
at
least
a
decade
to
repair
the
city
of
london
s
policy
chief
said
brexit
poses
the
biggest
challenge
to
the
city
since
the
global
crisis
as
it
will
probably
lead
to
banks
and
insurers
losing
full
or
partial
access
to
the
european
union
the
world
s
biggest
trading
bloc
catherine
mcguinness
said
banks
insurers
and
asset
managers
in
the
square
mile
financial
district
were
pushing
ahead
with
setting
up
new
hubs
in
the
european
union
by
march
without
waiting
to
see
if
parliament
votes
through
a
divorce
settlement
the
prospect
of
lawmakers
voting
through
the
deal
first
time
next
tuesday
appears
slim
raising
the
likelihood
of
a
hard
brexit
which
throws
up
greater
trade
barriers
for
financial
firms
people
realise
it
is
going
to
be
very
turbulent
whatever
happens
mcguinness
told
reuters
the
scenario
would
be
happening
by
accident
or
the
city
is
exasperated
with
the
uncertainty
surrounding
brexit
which
has
hurt
britain
s
image
abroad
and
will
take
time
to
rebuild
she
said
we
do
travel
the
world
quite
extensively
and
i
do
find
people
asking
what
is
going
on
in
the
uk
saying
you
used
to
be
so
and
rather
boring
and
now
you
seem
to
have
become
the
hot
heads
and
hot
bloods
of
europe
she
said
the
uncertainty
for
britain
s
largest
economic
sector
would
continue
whether
a
transition
deal
starts
next
march
or
if
britain
crashed
out
of
the
bloc
mcguinness
said
about
financial
jobs
are
expected
to
have
left
britain
by
brexit
day
with
a
further
shift
in
staff
and
operations
likely
we
won
t
know
what
we
are
going
to
look
like
for
at
least
years
mcguinness
said
adding
that
the
city
will
remain
a
leading
global
financial
centre
which
adapts
to
create
jobs
in
areas
like
fintech
after
a
standstill
transition
is
due
to
end
in
december
if
approved
the
sector
faces
more
limited
access
to
the
eu
s
financial
market
after
an
industry
push
for
broader
relations
was
rejected
by
brussels
looking
back
over
the
period
since
britain
s
referendum
in
favour
of
brexit
mcguinness
said
the
sector
underestimated
how
unified
the
eu
would
be
and
the
other
pressing
issues
the
bloc
faces
we
forget
it
isn
t
just
an
economic
exercise
for
the
but
a
major
political
one
it
s
a
lack
of
understanding
on
what
the
eu
is
seeking
to
achieve
she
said
some
lawmakers
have
proposed
that
britain
could
temporarily
at
least
have
close
ties
with
the
eu
like
norway
but
mcguinness
said
that
becoming
a
rule
taker
or
having
to
follow
the
bloc
s
regulation
without
a
say
would
be
divisive
the
financial
sector
also
worries
that
if
there
is
a
general
election
to
end
political
gridlock
over
brexit
the
opposition
labour
party
could
end
up
in
government
and
introduce
sweeping
changes
such
as
tax
on
financial
transactions
overseas
and
business
are
looking
very
carefully
at
what
announcements
are
being
made
and
whether
they
are
or
not
mcguinness
said
anyone
making
policies
needs
to
think
very
hard
about
priorities
and
jobs
and
growth
and
what
is
best
for
