low emission zones improve city air, but not enough - study
london
reuters
london
s
low
emission
traffic
zone
has
modestly
reduced
residents
exposure
to
diesel
engine
pollution
but
the
better
air
quality
has
not
brought
improved
lung
health
among
the
capital
s
children
research
found
on
wednesday
the
results
suggest
that
while
air
pollution
levels
may
be
reduced
by
low
emission
zones
that
are
now
in
place
in
around
cities
across
europe
extra
measures
are
needed
to
deliver
air
clean
enough
to
improve
health
the
world
health
organization
says
outdoor
air
pollution
is
linked
to
million
premature
deaths
a
year
globally
in
europe
where
more
than
half
of
new
cars
are
nitrogen
oxide
which
has
been
linked
to
asthma
and
impaired
lung
development
in
children
has
become
a
major
problem
low
emission
zones
are
seen
as
a
way
to
tackle
traffic
pollution
and
there
are
now
around
in
operation
across
europe
london
introduced
the
world
s
largest
citywide
low
emission
zone
in
stages
during
and
requiring
diesel
vehicles
entering
greater
london
to
meet
certain
emission
standards
or
pay
daily
charges
this
study
published
in
the
lancet
public
health
journal
on
wednesday
looked
at
data
from
more
than
school
children
aged
and
years
old
living
in
highly
polluted
areas
of
london
s
low
emission
zone
between
and
the
children
were
given
yearly
winter
health
checks
that
included
measuring
lung
function
and
size
parents
were
asked
to
complete
a
medical
questionnaire
about
the
children
with
information
on
breathing
and
allergic
symptoms
such
as
asthma
eczema
and
hay
fever
the
results
found
that
despite
improvements
in
air
quality
after
the
low
emission
zone
was
implemented
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
fall
in
the
proportion
of
children
with
small
lungs
or
asthma
symptoms
over
the
following
five
years
in
many
areas
of
london
air
pollution
still
remains
a
major
issue
said
chris
griffiths
a
professor
at
queen
mary
university
of
london
who
the
research
he
said
many
areas
of
the
city
are
still
breaching
eu
air
pollution
standards
and
are
unlikely
to
meet
them
without
a
substantial
tightening
of
current
emission
london
is
set
to
introduce
an
ultra
low
emission
zone
early
next
year
a
measure
experts
say
should
deliver
major
improvements
in
air
quality
ian
mudway
a
professor
at
king
s
college
london
who
also
worked
on
the
study
said
there
is
an
urgent
need
to
improve
air
quality
in
congested
cities
but
he
stressed
the
importance
of
evaluating
the
effectiveness
of
policies
not
only
in
terms
of
whether
they
improve
air
quality
but
more
importantly
whether
they
deliver
better
health
