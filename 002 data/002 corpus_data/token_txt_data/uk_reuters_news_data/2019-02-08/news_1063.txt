london
reuters
british
lawmakers
on
friday
accused
royal
bank
of
scotland
rbs
chief
executive
ross
mcewan
of
withholding
information
when
he
gave
evidence
to
their
committee
in
january
a
charge
the
ceo
disputes
nicky
morgan
chair
of
parliament
s
treasury
committee
said
mcewan
failed
to
disclose
when
asked
whether
there
had
been
any
criminal
activity
at
the
bank
that
one
of
its
former
employees
was
under
investigation
by
police
despite
rbs
having
been
aware
of
this
since
mcewan
said
in
a
statement
he
did
not
disclose
the
information
because
he
did
not
consider
it
related
to
the
subject
under
discussion
with
lawmakers
the
ceo
was
called
before
the
treasury
committee
to
discuss
allegations
of
malpractice
at
rbs
s
restructuring
unit
in
the
aftermath
of
the
financial
crisis
britain
s
financial
conduct
authority
investigated
the
unit
for
the
period
from
to
and
concluded
that
many
aspects
of
its
culture
governance
and
practices
were
deficient
although
there
had
not
been
criminal
activity
as
the
police
investigation
into
the
employee
related
to
a
later
period
mcewan
did
not
consider
it
relevant
to
the
committee
s
inquiry
i
replied
to
the
committee
s
questions
in
good
faith
he
said
in
a
statement
however
morgan
said
his
explanation
in
a
letter
to
the
committee
was
unconvincing
if
the
committee
decides
to
ask
mr
mcewan
to
provide
further
oral
evidence
it
will
expect
him
to
tell
the
whole
truth
not
an
edited
version
to
suit
him
she
said
in
a
statement
the
treasury
committee
is
an
influential
group
of
lawmakers
in
june
the
committee
said
it
had
lost
confidence
in
tsb
bank
boss
paul
pester
after
an
it
crisis
under
widespread
pressure
pester
stepped
down
this
month
morgan
said
rbs
had
displayed
a
pattern
of
defensiveness
and
failure
to
acknowledge
mistakes
throughout
its
handling
of
the
problems
at
the
restructuring
group
mcewan
s
letter
to
me
is
an
example
of
this
and
it
casts
doubt
on
his
assurances
that
rbs
s
culture
has
changed
fundamentally
since
he
took
up
his
position
