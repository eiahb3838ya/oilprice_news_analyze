update 3-eu nations back rules that may stall russia's nord stream 2 pipeline
brussels
reuters
european
union
nations
backed
a
plan
to
regulate
russia
s
nord
stream
pipeline
on
friday
a
move
that
will
likely
slow
but
not
rule
out
its
construction
the
agreement
comes
after
a
german
and
french
push
to
amend
the
draft
and
give
berlin
a
greater
say
in
how
to
ensure
the
pipeline
to
carry
russian
gas
to
europe
under
the
baltic
sea
complies
with
eu
law
chancellor
angela
merkel
hailed
the
vote
as
an
example
of
berlin
s
close
ties
with
paris
after
the
two
major
european
powers
which
both
have
firms
invested
in
the
project
were
publicly
at
odds
ahead
of
the
eu
meeting
nord
stream
has
divided
the
eu
with
german
opposition
to
the
new
draft
rules
stalling
discussions
since
it
was
proposed
by
the
eu
executive
in
november
eastern
european
nordic
and
baltic
sea
countries
see
the
km
mile
pipeline
which
is
already
under
construction
as
increasing
eu
reliance
on
moscow
while
those
in
northern
europe
especially
germany
prioritize
the
economic
benefits
eu
capitals
overcame
differences
on
friday
over
shared
geopolitical
concerns
that
the
pipeline
would
deprive
ukraine
of
transit
fees
that
are
a
lifeline
of
its
economy
by
doubling
the
amount
of
gas
that
could
be
pumped
under
the
baltic
sea
such
worries
have
driven
fierce
lobbying
against
the
russian
project
a
french
official
rejected
suggestions
that
washington
s
threat
to
sanction
the
project
broke
the
eu
logjam
we
don
t
make
decisions
based
on
bravado
the
official
said
france
had
long
raised
concerns
in
private
about
the
pipeline
not
wanting
to
be
seen
as
supporting
the
stance
and
french
president
emmanuel
macron
discussed
it
at
least
four
times
with
merkel
said
another
source
familiar
with
the
issue
the
draft
law
will
likely
require
a
change
in
business
model
for
the
project
led
by
russian
state
energy
firm
gazprom
in
partnership
with
five
western
firms
germany
s
uniper
and
basf
s
wintershall
unit
firm
shell
austria
s
omv
and
france
s
engie
it
calls
for
all
import
pipelines
to
meet
eu
energy
market
rules
by
not
being
directly
owned
by
gas
suppliers
applying
tariffs
and
transparent
reporting
and
allowing
at
least
percent
of
capacity
to
be
made
available
to
third
parties
berlin
worked
overnight
with
paris
to
amend
the
proposed
bill
when
it
became
clear
that
it
had
lost
its
blocking
minority
among
the
nations
the
changes
give
it
greater
say
because
the
pipeline
would
connect
with
the
european
gas
grid
in
germany
eu
sources
say
berlin
may
now
seek
an
exemption
from
the
bloc
s
energy
rules
or
it
may
cut
a
deal
with
moscow
over
how
the
pipeline
is
operated
subject
to
review
by
the
eu
executive
the
details
of
the
proposal
may
still
shift
when
the
eu
s
three
lawmaking
institutions
meet
next
week
to
agree
the
final
rules
if
adopted
eu
diplomats
say
the
rules
will
not
stop
the
pipeline
but
are
likely
to
make
its
completion
more
costly
and
lengthy
the
pipeline
plan
has
become
increasingly
controversial
since
russia
s
annexation
of
ukraine
s
crimea
in
in
an
effort
to
address
concerns
merkel
has
insisted
that
gas
volumes
must
continue
via
ukraine
the
traditional
route
for
supplies
that
make
up
over
a
third
of
the
eu
s
gas
needs
so
far
talks
between
russia
and
ukraine
have
failed
to
agree
the
terms
of
such
transits
before
their
current
contract
expires
by
year
s
end
russia
has
been
in
mode
but
this
compromise
gives
the
european
commission
major
leverage
said
one
of
the
sources
any
delay
to
gazprom
s
push
to
complete
construction
of
nord
stream
in
could
weaken
moscow
s
hand
in
those
negotiations
western
firms
invested
in
the
project
have
so
far
each
financed
million
euros
million
until
year
s
end
in
what
they
say
is
a
sign
of
faith
that
it
will
be
continued
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
it
would
be
fatal
if
a
fully
approved
project
in
which
billions
have
been
invested
could
suddenly
no
longer
be
carried
out
omv
ceo
rainer
seele
said
earlier
this
week
that
wouldn
t
necessarily
strengthen
investor
confidence
in
eu
imports
of
russian
gas
