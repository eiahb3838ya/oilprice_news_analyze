brussels
reuters
the
european
union
is
ready
to
have
a
closer
relationship
with
the
united
kingdom
after
brexit
so
that
the
contentious
irish
border
backstop
would
never
have
to
be
used
the
brexit
pointman
for
the
bloc
s
parliament
said
speaking
after
he
met
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
in
brussels
to
demand
that
the
backstop
is
removed
from
the
brexit
deal
guy
verhofstadt
said
the
bloc
could
only
upgrade
the
accompanying
declaration
on
their
new
relationship
it
s
important
that

today
in
the
meeting
assured
us
that
there
will
be
a

would
spell
disaster
in
both
the

may
s
cooperation
with
britain
s
opposition
labour
party
which
wants
a
permanent
customs
union
with
the
bloc
after
brexit
was
essential
to
overcoming
that
risk
it
s
important
now
that
this
leads
to
a
position
in
the
uk
that
has
the
broadest
possible
majority
so
that
we
can
conclude
this
negotiation

go
towards
a
customs
union

never
be
eu
leaders
have
repeatedly
said
it
would
be
impossible
to
replace
