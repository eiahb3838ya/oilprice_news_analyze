the
lion
air
boeing
max
jet
that
crashed
in
indonesia
on
monday
flew
erratically
the
previous
evening
and
its
airspeed
readings
were
unreliable
according
to
an
accident
investigator
and
a
flight
tracking
website
according
to
data
from
the
jet
displayed
unusual
variations
in
altitude
and
airspeed
in
the
first
several
minutes
of
flight
after
taking
off
from
denpasar
on
the
holiday
island
of
bali
on
sunday
evening
including
an
drop
over
seconds
when
it
would
normally
be
ascending
before
stabilising
and
flying
on
to
jakarta
however
the
pilots
kept
the
plane
at
a
maximum
altitude
of
feet
compared
with
feet
on
the
same
route
earlier
in
the
week
lion
air
ceo
edward

told

a
technical
problem
had
occurred

it
had
been
resolved
according

procedure
national
transport
safety
committee
nstc
deputy
chief
haryo
satmiko
told
reporters
on
tuesday
there
were
technical
problems
on
that
flight
including
unreliable
airspeed
readings
the
suspected
cause
of
the
accident
is
still
being
investigated
and
it
is
making
us
all
curious
what
could
have
caused
it
he
said
satmiko
gave
no
further
details
two
passengers
on
sunday
s
flight
posted
on
instagram
reporting
that
they
had
been
concerned
about
problems
with
the
air
conditioning
system
and
cabin
lighting
before
the
plane
departed
nearly
three
hours
late
i
was
angry
because
as
a
passenger
who
had
paid
her
ticket
we
have
every
right
to
question
the
aircraft
s
safety
said
one
of
them
tv
presenter
conchita
caroline
she
added
there
was
a
weird
engine
noise
upon
that
continued
during
flight
it
was
not
clear
if
the
cabin
problems
were
in
any
way
related
to
the
technical
trouble
mentioned
by
the
airline
s
ceo
the
flight
landed
at
local
time
on
sunday
giving
engineers
hours
at
most
for
checks
before
it
was
dispatched
for
the
fatal
pinang
flight
at
on
monday
the
plane
plunged
into
the
sea
minutes
after
taking
off
from
jakarta
and
all
people
on
board
are
believed
dead
also
reported
unusual
air
speeds
and
altitudes
in
the
few
minutes
that
flight
was
in
the
air
on
monday
photos
of
alleged
technical
and
maintenance
logs
following
the
sunday
flight
have
been
circulating
online
but
to
date
they
have
not
been
verified
as
accurate
by
the
airline
or
investigators
sirait
declined
to
detail
the
maintenance
procedures
taken
and
on
tuesday
he
told
reuters
the
airline
had
provided
the
relevant
aircraft
flight
and
maintenance
logs
to
ntsc
ntsc
chairman
soerjanto
tjahjono
said
there
was
a
similarity
between
the
maintenance
log
circulating
online
and
the
one
received
from
lion
air
but
he
had
not
checked
the
exact
details
satmiko
said
the
agency
had
not
yet
met
with
the
technician
who
handled
the
maintenance
of
the
aircraft
between
the
two
flights
safety
experts
say
the
crash
investigation
is
at
a
very
preliminary
stage
and
it
is
too
early
to
speculate
about
the
cause
but
pilot
and
engineering
sources
told
reuters
the
data
for
both
flights
while
not
conclusive
could
be
a
potential
indicator
of
something
wrong
with
the
pitot
static
systems
those
are
instruments
that
feed
airspeed
and
altitude
information
to
an
avionics
computer
certainly
the
big
changes
in
very
early
on
in
the
flight
is
what
makes
me
think
unreliable
speed
said
a
pilot
at
another
airline
who
declined
to
be
named
because
he
was
not
authorised
to
speak
to
media
the
data
from
shows
the
first
sign
that
something
was
amiss
on
monday
s
fated
flight
came
about
two
minutes
after
when
the
plane
had
reached
feet
at
that
point
it
descended
more
than
feet
and
veered
to
the
left
before
climbing
again
to
feet
where
it
stayed
during
most
of
the
rest
of
the
flight
it
began
gaining
speed
in
the
final
moments
and
reached
knots
mph
before
data
was
lost
when
it
was
at
feet
they
were
going
way
faster
than
you
would
normally
expect
said
a
second
pilot
at
another
airline
two
fishermen
who
saw
the
crash
from
their
boat
out
at
sea
told
reuters
that
the
plane
swayed
slightly
but
made
no
noise
as
it
fell
almost
horizontal
with
its
nose
slightly
down
there
was
an
explosive
sound
as
it
plunged
into
the
sea
and
then
there
was
a
column
of
smoke
the
weather
was
clear
at
the
time
of
the
crash
at
on
monday
according
to
the
head
of
indonesia
s
transport
safety
committee
who
said
the
pilots
had
requested
a
turnback
to
jakarta
a
safe
visual
landing
should
have
been
possible
even
with
faulty
indicators
and
a
lack
of
autopilot
