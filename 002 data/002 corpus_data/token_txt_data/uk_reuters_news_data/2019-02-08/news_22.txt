eu antitrust policy under fire after siemens-alstom deal blocked
reuters
siemens
and
alstom
s
plan
to
create
a
european
rail
champion
collapsed
on
wednesday
after
eu
regulators
blocked
the
deal
prompting
germany
and
france
to
call
for
an
overhaul
of
eu
competition
policy
to
better
meet
global
challenges
the
european
commission
also
rejected
a
bid
by
german
copper
company
ag
to
buy
a
business
unit
from
aurubis
europe
s
biggest
copper
smelter
similarly
arguing
the
deal
could
have
pushed
up
prices
for
consumers
the
two
vetoes
are
likely
to
spur
efforts
by
france
and
germany
to
loosen
eu
competition
rules
so
as
to
take
a
more
global
than
solely
european
view
of
mergers
and
potentially
to
allow
eu
ministers
to
have
a
say
shortly
after
the
commission
s
announcements
german
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
said
berlin
and
paris
were
working
on
a
proposal
to
change
european
competition
rules
to
facilitate
large
mergers
france
s
alstom
said
the
veto
was
a
clear
for
industry
in
europe
while
joe
kaeser
the
chief
executive
of
germany
s
siemens
said
europe
urgently
needed
to
reform
its
industrial
policy
to
help
its
companies
compete
protecting
customer
interests
locally
must
not
mean
that
europe
can
not
be
on
a
level
playing
field
with
leading
nations
like
china
the
united
states
and
others
kaeser
said
in
a
statement
proponents
of
the
bloc
s
strict
merger
regime
however
argue
such
changes
could
lead
to
opaque
and
unpredictable
rules
the
commission
has
approved
over
mergers
in
the
past
years
and
blocked
only
nine
including
those
on
wednesday
eu
competition
commissioner
margrethe
vestager
dismissed
siemens
and
alstom
s
argument
about
merging
to
compete
with
their
bigger
chinese
rival
crrc
in
the
european
market
we
don
t
see
the
chinese
coming
the
chinese
are
nowhere
not
at
all
in
europe
she
told
a
news
conference
shares
in
siemens
were
little
changed
by
the
announcement
which
was
widely
expected
however
alstom
stock
gained
more
than
percent
broker
berenberg
said
the
market
had
been
overly
focused
on
the
potential
benefits
of
the
rail
merger
and
ignoring
that
alstom
s
earnings
could
double
by
alstom
chief
executive
henri
told
reporters
the
company
was
looking
into
new
avenues
for
expansion
saying
future
growth
would
be
more
organic

siemens
and
alstom
had
wanted
to
combine
their
rail
operations
to
compete
more
effectively
with
crrc
globally
backed
by
the
french
and
german
governments
which
favour
creating
industrial
champions
however
vestager
said
she
blocked
the
deal
to
protect
competition
in
the
european
railway
industry
without
sufficient
remedies
this
merger
would
have
resulted
in
higher
prices
for
the
signalling
systems
that
keep
passengers
safe
and
for
the
next
generations
of
very
trains
she
said
in
the
copper
case
vestager
said
rolled
copper
would
become
even
more
important
in
an
age
of
electrical
vehicles
she
said
the
companies
in
both
deals
were
not
willing
adequately
to
address
the
regulator
s
competition
concerns
and
their
concessions
fell
short
the
rail
deal
also
triggered
criticism
from
national
competition
agencies
in
germany
britain
spain
belgium
and
the
netherlands

canadian
rival
bombardier
welcomed
the
commission
s
decision
it
would
have
severely
undermined
the
health
and
competitiveness
of
the
whole
european
rail
market
leaving
european
consumers
both
as
rail
users
and
tax
payers
to
pay
the
price
said
daniel
desjardins
bombardier
general
counsel
and
company
secretary
bombardier
which
sources
say
also
held
talks
with
siemens
in
would
have
faced
a
rival
with
operations
more
than
double
its
size
in
the
european
market
even
though
the
merged
group
in
revenue
terms
would
only
have
been
half
the
size
