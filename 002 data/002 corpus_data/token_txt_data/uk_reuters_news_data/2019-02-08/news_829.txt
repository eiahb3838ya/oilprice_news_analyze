the
potential
for
british
online
fashion
retailer
asos
is
huge
as
the
shift
to
internet
shopping
accelerates
the

said
on
wednesday
sending
its

soaring
as
it
beat

asos

current

are
for
a
billion
pounds
billion
a

business
in
terms
of
revenue
up
from
billion

in
the

to
but
that
s
not
the
end
for
us
we
will
continue
to
invest
and
we
re
eyeing
up
a
significantly
bigger
prize
than
billion
pounds
chief
executive
nick
beighton
told
reporters
the
opportunity
for
asos
remains
huge
which
is
why
we
re
investing
to
capture
it
he
said
asos
which
sells
fashion
aimed
at
twentysomethings
invested
million
pounds
in
its
financial
year
mainly
on
warehouses
and
it
and
plans
to
spend
million
a
year
over
the
medium
term
while
asos
and
online
peer
boohoo
continue
to
report
robust
sales
growth
britain
s
traditional
clothing
retailers
such
as
marks
spencer
debenhams
and
house
of
fraser
are
struggling
and
closing
stores
beighton
said
online
sales
currently
account
for
about
percent
of
the
uk
clothing
market
and
that
this
is
forecast
to
hit
percent
within
five
years
the
united
states
and
europe
are
following
similar
patterns
while
asos
market
share
in
britain
is
percent
it
is
still
tiny
overseas
with
shares
of
percent
in
the
rest
of
europe
and

in
the
united
states
prior
to
wednesday
s
update
asos
shares
had
fallen
percent
this
year
the
stock
listed
on
london
s
junior
aim
market
fell
sharply
in
july
after
the
firm
missed
analysts
forecasts
for
third
quarter
sales
growth
asos
said
at
the
time
it
had
reined
in
marketing
as
it
focused
on
ramping
up
warehouse
space
in
germany
and
the
united
states
but
on
wednesday
the
firm
hit
sales
growth
forecasts
and
reported
a
percent
rise
in
pretax
profit
combined
with
its
confident
outlook
that
sent
its
stock
as
much
as
percent
higher
shares
in
the
old
company
were
up
pence
at
pence
at
gmt
giving
a
market
capitalisation
of
billion
pounds
just
ahead
of
the
old
marks
spencer
s
at
billion
pounds
we
believe
that
asos
remains
a
structural
winner
given
the
shift
online
by
consumers
together
with
harnessing
the
global
opportunity
as
the
platform
for
online
clothing
said
shore
capital
analyst
greg
lawless
maintaining
a
buy
stance
asos
made
a
pretax
profit
of
million
pounds
in
the
year
to
just
ahead
of
analysts
average
forecast
of
million
pounds
on
the
back
of
a
percent
jump
in
retail
sales
and
percent
rise
in
active
customers
the
underlying
business
is
humming
said
beighton
asos
forecast
sales
growth
of
percent
for
the
year
and
expects
to
grow
at
that
rate
for
the
medium
term
the
difficulties
at
traditional
retailers
in
the
face
of
internet
competition
has
prompted
calls
in
britain
for
a
relaxation
of
business
rates
a
property
tax
and
for
the
imposition
of
an
online
sales
tax
to
level
the
playing
field
it
strikes
me
the
core
problem
to
solve
and
where
the
attention
should
be
is
on
solving
corporation
tax
leakage
and
fixing
business
rates
said
beighton
we
will
pay
whatever
tax
the
government
says
we
should
