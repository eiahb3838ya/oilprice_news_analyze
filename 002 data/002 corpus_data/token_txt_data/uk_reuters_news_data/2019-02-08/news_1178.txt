london
reuters
britain
s
ftse
will
take
until
the
end
of
next
year
to
return
close
to
record
levels
according
to
a
reuters
poll
held
back
in
the
as
investors
grapple
with
the
possibility
that
britain
leaves
the
european
union
with
no
deal
the
median
forecast
of
analysts
brokers
and
fund
managers
polled
by
reuters
projects
the
ftse
reaching
by
the
end
of
just
shy
of
its
record
high
of
hit
in
may
in
a
poll
taken
three
months
ago
the
panel
expected
the
ftse
to
hit
six
months
earlier
by
the
middle
of
next
year
the
latest
reuters
survey
results
suggest
the
ftse
will
end
this
year
up
just
percent
and
then
gain
percent
in
well
below
the
expected
overall
rate
of
inflation
those
gains
in
percentage
terms
are
also
just
half
of
those
forecast
for
the
stoxx
worries
that
britain
could
fail
to
reach
a
deal
with
brussels
before
it
leaves
the
european
union
in
march
have
been
a
particular
pain
point
for
uk
equities
and
sterling
this
year
in
the
uk
the
key
is
clarity
on
the
final
outcome
of
the
brexit
negotiations
with
the
eu
ian
forrest
investment
research
analyst
at
the
share
centre
said
if
there
is
no
clarity
by
march
next
year
the
market
will
become
increasingly
volatile
if
the
prospect
of
no
deal
gets
closer
he
added
in
the
meantime
that
lack
of
clarity
has
forced
businesses
to
delay
investment
decisions
while
investors
have
shied
away
from
uk
equities
so
far
this
year
uk
equities
have
lost
percent
that
followed
two
years
of
gains
fuelled
by
a
weak
currency
since
the
june
referendum
vote
to
leave
the
eu
the
ftse
s
large
constituents
have
benefited
from
a
revenue
boost
from
a
weaker
pound
but
allocations
to
uk
equities
by
fund
managers
this
month
had
their
biggest
drop
since
may
also
due
to
rising
worries
over
a
brexit
scenario
according
to
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
s
august
fund
manager
survey
more
than
a
quarter
of
fund
managers
are
underweight
uk
equities
coupled
with
the
fact
the
uk
market
remains
cheap
compared
with
euro
zone
stocks
on
a
forward
basis
some
investors
see
this
as
an
opportunity
brexit
poses
a
lot
of
challenges
to
uk
companies
but
it
s
certainly
not
the
nail
in
the
coffin
said
adam
laird
head
of
etf
strategy
for
northern
europe
at
lyxor
etf
remember
the
uk
market
has
a
lot
of
international
exposure
a
lot
of
mining
and
energy
investors
would
be
foolish
to
write
it
off
completely

ftse
cheaper
