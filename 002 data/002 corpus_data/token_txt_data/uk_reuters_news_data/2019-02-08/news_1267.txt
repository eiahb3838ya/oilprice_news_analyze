of
barring
its
citizens
from
this
year
s
haj
something
riyadh
denies
saying
a
diplomatic
dispute
is
not
stopping
qataris
from
making
the
pilgrimage
to
mecca
although
qataris
are
eligible
to
perform
the
haj
under
a
quota
system
qatar
says
it
has
become
impossible
to
get
permits
blaming
the
campaign
by
saudi
arabia
the
united
arab
emirates
bahrain
and
egypt
to
cut
trade
and
diplomatic
ties
with
the
country
abdullah
of
the
qatar
national
human
rights
committee
said
saudi
arabia
had
shut
down
an
electronic
system
used
by
travel
agencies
to
obtain
permits
for
pilgrims
from
qatar
there
is
no
chance
this
year
for
qatari
citizens
and
residents
to
travel
for
haj
he
told
reuters
registration
of
pilgrims
from
the
state
of
qatar
remains
closed
and
residents
of
qatar
can
not
be
granted
visas
as
there
are
no
diplomatic
a
saudi
official
said
qatar
had
blocked
several
registration
links
set
up
for
its
pilgrims
an
official
at
saudi
arabia
s
haj
ministry
said
a
group
of
qataris
had
arrived
for
the
pilgrimage
which
runs
from
sunday
to
but
he
did
not
say
how
many
there
were
or
whether
they
had
travelled
directly
from
qatar
last
year
qatari
pilgrims
attended
he
said
saudi
arabia
says
the
qatari
government
is
using
the
issue
for
political
ends
and
it
rejects
any
effort
to
politicise
the
haj
or
drag
political
differences
into
the
pilgrimage
the
official
said
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
saudi
arabia
and
the
three
other
arab
countries
closed
land
air
and
sea
links
with
qatar
in
july
last
year
accusing
it
of
funding
terrorism
something
doha
denies
saudi
arabia
has
said
qatari
pilgrims
can
arrive
on
any
airline
other
than
qatar
airways
but
three
travel
agencies
in
doha
told
reuters
they
had
stopped
trying
to
sell
haj
packages
which
can
cost
up
to
riyals
last
year
we
lost
a
lot
of
money
as
the
crisis
started
after
we
had
booked
everything
in
mecca
and
medina
and
we
had
to
pay
people
back
said
a
manager
of
one
travel
agency
in
doha
declining
to
be
named
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
matter
this
year
nobody
is
really
trying
as
people
have
understood
there
is
no
way
to
go
there
in
these
riyadh
temporarily
opened
the
land
border
for
the
haj
last
year
but
not
this
time
a
travel
agency
catering
to
migrant
labourers
in
doha
said
that
had
hit
business
we
sell
haj
journeys
by
bus
with
accommodation
for
around
riyals
its
manager
said
but
as
nobody
can
get
visas
and
land
borders
are
closed
it
is
zero
bookings
this
the
diplomatic
crisis
has
defied
mediation
efforts
by
the
united
states
which
has
strong
alliances
with
both
sides
and
fears
the
split
among
its
sunni
muslim
allies
could
benefit
shi
ite
iran
saudi
arabia
and
iran
are
involved
in
proxy
wars
including
in
yemen
and
syria
and
tensions
between
the
two
have
spilled
over
into
the
haj
in
the
past
in
iran
boycotted
the
haj
over
security
concerns
after
hundreds
of
people
were
killed
in
a
crush
there
