the

church
s
holy
synod
ruling
body
convened

to
consider
how
to

as
the
ukrainian
orthodox
church
has
courted
constantinople
to
formally
make
it
a
body
independent
of
moscow
ukraine
s
political
leaders
have
sought
step
by
step
to
take
the
former
soviet
republic
out
of
moscow
s
orbit
after
russia
annexed
the
crimean
peninsula
in
and
a
insurgency
broke
out
in
eastern
ukraine
vladimir
legoida
a
russian
church
spokesman
said
the
holy
synod
had
decided
to
suspend
its
participation
in
all
structures
chaired
or
by
representatives
of
the
patriarchate
of
constantinople
it
is
also
suspending
all
services
with
top
priests
of
the
patriarchate
of
constantinople
and
will
not
commemorate
the
ecumenical
patriarch
bartholomew
i
in
its
services
legoida
wrote
on
social
media
summarising
the
outcome
of
the
meeting
essentially
this
is
a
breakdown
of
relations
to
take
an
example
from
secular
life
the
decision
is
roughly
equivalent
to
cutting
diplomatic
ties
the
russian
church
s
metropolitan
ilarion
was
quoted
by
ria
news
agency
as
saying
the
moscow
patriarchate
is
part
of
the
russian
orthodox
church
and
has
a
sizeable
following
in
ukraine
kiev
considers
it
a
tool
for
the
kremlin
to
wield
influence
while
the
moscow
patriarchate
sees
itself
as
the
only
legitimate
orthodox
church
in
ukraine
the
kremlin
said
it
was
following
the
situation
closely
and
opposed
any
split
in
orthodoxy
adding
that
the
state
should
not
intervene
in
church
matters
of
course
for
moscow
and
indeed
for
the
entire
orthodox
world
the
single
preferable
scenario
is
the
preservation
of
unity
of
this
orthodox
world
kremlin
spokesman
dmitry
peskov
told
reporters
on
a
conference
call
the
moscow
patriarchate
vies
for
influence
in
ukraine
with
the
kiev
patriarchate
a
branch
of
the
orthodox
church
that
broke
away
from
moscow
in
after
the
fall
of
the
soviet
union
and
with
other
orthodox
and
catholic
denominations
the
kiev
patriarchate
s
leader
has
been
sharply
critical
of
russian
president
vladimir
putin
and
in
suggested
he
was
possessed
by
satan
the
ecumenical
patriarch
does
not
wield
the
power
enjoyed
by
the
pope
in
the
roman
catholic
church
but
is
traditionally
regarded
as
the
first
among
equals
among
the
patriarchs
of
the
orthodox
churches
and
also
as
the
spiritual
leader
of
the
roughly
million
orthodox
christians
worldwide
the
ecumenical
patriarch
currently
bartholomew
also
holds
the
title
of
archbishop
of
constantinople
the
old
greek
name
for
istanbul
turkey
s
largest
city
the
city
fell
to
the
muslim
turks
in
but
has
remained
the
historic
seat
of
orthodoxy
however
russia
has
long
been
home
to
the
world
s
largest
orthodox
christian
church
