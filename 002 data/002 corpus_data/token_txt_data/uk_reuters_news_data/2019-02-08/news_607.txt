no-deal brexit would cost britain 6 percent of gdp, imf warns
london
reuters
leaving
the
european
union
without
a
transitional
trade
deal
would
cost
britain
about
percent
of
gdp
roughly
four
years
of
economic
growth
compared
with
staying
in
the
bloc
the
international
monetary
fund
said
on
wednesday
the
imf
which
warned
of
the
costs
of
brexit
before
britons
voted
to
leave
in
june
said
securing
a
trade
deal
would
roughly
halve
the
economic
damage
from
trade
barriers
and
reduced
foreign
investment
and
immigration
directors
emphasised
the
importance
of
a
timely
agreement
with
the
eu
accompanied
by
an
implementation
period
to
avoid
a
exit
in
march
and
to
allow
firms
and
workers
time
to
adjust
to
the
new
relationship
the
imf
said
two
months
ago
imf
managing
director
christine
lagarde
said
she
expected
the
world
s
economy
would
shrink
outright
if
it
left
the
eu
without
a
deal
the
imf
s
estimates
part
of
a
regular
review
of
britain
s
economy
come
as
prime
minister
theresa
may
is
attempting
to
secure
her
top
ministers
agreement
to
a
transitional
deal
which
will
then
need
approval
by
parliament
and
the
eu
some
supporters
of
brexit
have
argued
that
britain
would
be
better
off
leaving
without
any
deal
with
brussels
if
they
can
not
secure
their
full
demands
trading
instead
under
world
trade
organization
rules
the
imf
forecast
this
would
carry
a
cost
in
a
scenario
in
which
the
uk
and
eu
trade
under
world
trade
organization
rules
the
level
of
output
is
likely
to
fall
by
between
about
and
percent
relative
to
a
scenario
with
an
average
of
about
percent
the
imf
said
britain
s
economy
has
slowed
since
the
brexit
vote
its
annual
growth
rate
fell
from
the
top
of
the
group
of
nations
to
near
the
bottom
as
businesses
put
investment
on
hold
and
higher
inflation
reduced
households
disposable
income
some
eurosceptics
in
may
s
conservative
party
say
a
brexit
would
allow
britain
to
reach
trade
deals
with
third
countries
more
easily
and
determine
its
own
regulations
but
may
favours
a
transitional
arrangement
that
she
hopes
will
preserve
free
trade
in
goods
though
not
services
while
placing
controls
on
immigration
from
the
eu
the
imf
said
this
type
of
free
trade
agreement
would
reduce
british
gdp
by
around
to
percent
probably
about
percent
over
an
unspecified
period
compared
with
staying
in
the
eu
may
has
ruled
out
staying
in
before
the
referendum
the
imf
estimated
brexit
would
have
a
cost
of
between
percent
and
percent
of
gdp
depending
on
the
terms
of
departure
the
effect
of
brexit
would
vary
widely
between
industries
the
imf
said
britain
s
financial
services
chemicals
and
automotive
industries
were
likely
to
suffer
most
from
new
regulatory
barriers
and
disrupted
supply
chains
by
contrast
farms
food
processors
and
oil
and
mining
companies
might
do
better
government
programmes
would
be
needed
to
retrain
british
workers
for
these
jobs
