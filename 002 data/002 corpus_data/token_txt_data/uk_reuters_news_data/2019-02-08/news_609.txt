london

the
draft
brexit
deal
agreed
between
britain
and
the
european
union
won
t
stop
banks
in

with
relocation

because
the

is
far
from
being
ratified

financial
sector
officials
said

wednesday
the
deal
agreed
between
britain
and
brussels
on
tuesday
includes
a
transition
period
from
march
to
the
end
of
uk
ministers
and
parliament
or
the
eu
itself
have
yet
to
ratify
the
deal
whose
details
are
dividing
the
ruling
conservative
party
of
prime
minister
theresa
may
the
announcement
that
a
draft
brexit
agreement
has
been
reached
between
the
uk
and
eu
is
a
step
forward
but
there
is
still
a
long
way
to
go
before
the
deal
is
done
said
catherine
mcguinness
chairman
of
the
city
of
london
financial
district
banks
insurers
and
asset
managers
in
britain
are
opening
new
eu
hubs
to
avoid
disruption
to
services
next
march
regardless
of
whether
there
will
be
a
transition
period
our
clients
are
continuing
with
their
planning
and
execution

joe
cassidy
financial
services
brexit
lead
at
consultants
kpmg
everybody
knows
we
are
just
at
the
beginning
and
not
at
the
end
and
a
lot
could
happen
in
the
intervening
other
industry
source
said
only
a
legally
binding
divorce
settlement
and
transition
period
would
prompt
banks
to
pause
relocation
plans
we
are
not
there
yet
until
we
are
we
would
expect
firms
regulators
and
governments
to
continue
to
prepare
for
all
outcomes
including
a
no
deal
scenario
the
source
said
mcguinness
said
eu
regulators
should
in
the
meantime
urgently
mirror
efforts
by
uk
regulators
to
address
potential
in
markets
the
european
commission
published
on
tuesday
its
contingency
plans
that
include
allowing
eu
customers
to
continue
clearing
derivatives
contracts
in
london
it
s
reassuring
to
hear
increasing
acknowledgment
that
these
issues
need
dealing
with
but
we
need
firm
action
not
just
words
firms
can
not
tackle
these
issues
alone
in
the
time
remaining
mcguinness
said
cassidy
said
the
plans
from
brussels
lack
detail
in
some
areas
a
reflection
of
how
negotiations
between
britain
and
the
eu
continue
it
s
a
good
direction
of
travel
cassidy
said
swiss
bank
ubs
told
cnbc
on
wednesday
that
the
next
few
weeks
will
be
very
important
for
britain
s
financial
markets
whose
biggest
customer
is
the
eu
we
re
prepared
for
the
worst
and
we
hope
for
the
best
said
axel
weber
chairman
of
ubs
which
is
spending
million
swiss
francs
on
moving
some
of
its
staff
in
london
to
frankfurt
fund
managers
in
britain
fear
they
won
t
be
able
to
continue
managing
funds
worth
trillions
of
pounds
across
the
eu
after
brexit
but
financial
services
minister
john
glen
said
the
deal
would
minimise
risks
in
markets
from
brexit
the
sheer
economic
weight
of
our
financial
services
sector
is
one
of
the
strongest
things
in
our
favour
it
means
we
will
not
retreat
to
a
place
of
isolation
nor
blindly
run
a
regulatory
race
to
the
bottom
he
told
a
managed
funds
association
conference
we
have
confidence
the
issue
will
be
resolved
and
resolved
soon
