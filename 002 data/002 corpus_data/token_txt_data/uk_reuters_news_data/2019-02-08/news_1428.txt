imran
khan
his
party
s
first
place
in
a
national
election
putting
him
on
the
brink
of
becoming
the
country
s
next
prime
minister
is
the
culmination
of
a
battle
that
started
more
than
two
decades
ago
for
years
he
was
dismissed
as
a
political
dilettante
who
could
not
convert
his
personal
popularity
into
significant
seats
in
parliament
for
the
pakistan
pti
or
pakistan
movement
for
justice
he
founded
but
wednesday
s
election
has
dramatically
changed
that
putting
the
former
sports
star
on
the
brink
of
power
with
nearly
half
the
votes
counted
pti
held
a
commanding
lead
and
khan
declared
victory
in
a
speech
on
thursday
khan
could
join
george
weah
one
of
africa
s
greatest
footballers
who
took
over
as
president
of
liberia
earlier
this
year
as
the
only
other
international
sports
personality
to
head
his
country
s
government
as
prime
minister
khan
would
be
tested
on
several
fronts
from
dealing
with
an
urgent
foreign
currency
shortage
to
managing
a
tense
relationship
with
the
united
states
i
don
t
discount
the
role
that
experience
in
sports
leadership
can
translate
into
other
domains
said
sameer
lalwani
of
the
south
asia
program
at
the
stimson
center
think
tank
but
he
has
never
had
to
govern
i
worry
that
what
we
ve
seen
about
his
public
profile
and
the
way
he
portrays
himself
that
he
is
much
more
likely
to
surround
himself
with
khan
will
also
have
to
battle
allegations
that
he
has
been
helped
by
pakistan
s
powerful
military
both
during
the
campaign
and
in
the
vote
count
rival
parties
have
said
soldiers
at
voting
centres
threw
out
their
observers
when
counting
began
khan
promised
to
investigate
voting
complaints
but
has
said
those
who
accuse
him
of
military
help
are
trying
to
preserve
a
corrupt
system
the
army
which
has
ruled
the
country
for
almost
half
its
history
denies
interfering
in
politics
an
oxford
graduate
khan
campaigned
hard
on
populist
promises
of
a
prosperous
pakistan
that
breaks
away
from
its
persistent
legacy
of
corruption
before
the
advent
of
pti
pakistani
politics
had
been
dominated
by
two
parties
former
prime
minister
nawaz
sharif
s
pakistan
muslim
and
the
pakistan
people
s
party
of
assassinated
former
leader
benazir
bhutto
when
the
military
has
not
been
in
power
khan
began
his
cricket
career
in
as
a
fast
bowler
known
for
his
pace
and
aggressive
tactics
by
the
time
he
retired
more
than
years
later
he
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
world
s
best
ever
a
glamorous
fixture
of
london
s
high
society
in
his
younger
days
he
was
captain
of
pakistan
s
team
of
talented
but
wayward
stars
and
with
a
reputation
as
a
stern
taskmaster
led
them
to
win
cricket
s
world
cup
for
the
first
time
in
he
is
still
known
as
kaptaan
captain
in
pakistan
after
his
retirement
khan
raised
funds
to
open
a
cancer
hospital
in
the
memory
of
his
mother
in
his
native
lahore
in
he
has
mostly
shed
the
playboy
image
and
made
public
shows
of
devotion
to
islam
building
a
large
political
following
in
northern
pakistan
especially
with
the
conservative
pashtun
population
earlier
this
year
he
married
his
spiritual
adviser
khan
s
previous
two
marriages
particularly
when
he
wed
his
first
wife
british
heiress
jemima
khan
had
captivated
international
tabloids
khan
started
the
pti
in
but
until
it
briefly
held
only
one
seat
in
parliament
it
s
been
a
struggle
for
justice
for
the
people
of
pakistan
khan
told
reuters
in
an
interview
earlier
this
month
his
party
became
the
country
s
in
the
national
assembly
in
the
previous
election
benefiting
in
part
from
a
groundswell
of
support
especially
from
young
urban
voters
fed
up
with
the
country
s
corruption
khan
has
been
critical
of
the
united
states
policy
in
the
region
and
vocally
opposed
drone
strikes
on
pakistani
territory
he
would
have
to
manage
a
tense
relationship
with
washington
which
has
accused
islamabad
of
not
doing
enough
to
root
out
taliban
militants
earlier
this
year
president
donald
trump
tweeted
that
the
united
states
had
foolishly
given
pakistan
more
than
billion
billion
in
aid
khan
opposes
the
united
states
presence
in
afghanistan
in
his
victory
speech
on
thursday
he
said
he
wanted
mutually
beneficial
relations
with
washington
and
peace
in
afghanistan
i
do
think
he
will
be
publicly
more
but
he
is
certainly
capable
of
being
more
pragmatic
that
just
hasn
t
served
his
purposes
in
campaigning
and
branding
himself
said
a
former
senior
official
who
has
met
khan
several
times
the
official
speaking
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
said
khan
s
stance
on
the
united
states
would
likely
be
moderated
by
pakistan
s
powerful
military
which
seeks
a
more
stable
relationship
with
america
khan
will
also
have
to
urgently
resolve
a
currency
crisis
that
threatens
pakistan
s
economy
which
expanded
by
percent
in
the
past
year
but
will
most
likely
need
its
second
bailout
from
the
international
monetary
fund
imf
since
he
has
said
his
future
government
will
launch
an
campaign
and
poverty
reduction
program
modelled
on
china
pakistan
s
traditional
ally
that
has
financed
billions
of
dollars
of
infrastructure
projects
at
the
same
time
he
has
promised
to
build
an
islamic
welfare
state
create
million
jobs
and
build
million
homes
for
the
poor
asked
how
he
would
fund
such
social
spending
khan
has
vowed
to
double
pakistan
s
woefully
low
tax
collection
rates
the
country
has
one
of
the
world
s
lowest
ratios
by
reforming
the
corrupt
federal
bureau
of
revenue
instead
of
making
policies
for
a
small
elite
we
will
make
all
policies
for
this
poor
class
the
oppressed
class
