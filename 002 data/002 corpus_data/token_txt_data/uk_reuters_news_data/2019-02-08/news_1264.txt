russian
president
vladimir
putin
and
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
discussed
the
conflicts
in
ukraine
and
syria
as
well
as
iran
and
a
gas
pipeline
project
that
has
drawn
ire
during
tough
talks
outside
berlin
that
ended
with
no
clearcut
progress
kremlin
spokesman
dmitry
peskov
told
reporters
no
agreements
were
reached
but
the
meeting
had
simply
been
intended
to
check
the
watches
after
merkel
s
meeting
with
putin
in
the
black
sea
resort
of
sochi
in
may
ties
between
the
two
countries
have
been
strained
since
russia
s
annexation
of
the
crimea
region
of
ukraine
in
the
two
leaders
both
viewed
the
nord
stream
pipeline
project
as
a
purely
commercial
venture
despite
persistent
fire
by
the
and
ukrainian
governments
peskov
said
that
s
why
it
is
necessary
to
take
measures
against
possible
and
illegal
attacks
from
the
third
countries
in
order
to
complete
this
project
eventually
he
told
reporters
shortly
before
putin
flew
back
to
russia
it
was
not
immediately
clear
what
such
measures
could
entail
at
the
start
of
the
talks
merkel
underscored
her
expectation
that
ukraine
should
continue
to
have
a
role
in
gas
transit
to
europe
and
welcomed
the
start
of
discussions
among
the
european
union
ukraine
and
russia
on
that
issue
putin
speaking
at
the
german
government
s
meseburg
castle
said
such
a
move
had
to
make
sense
from
a
business
perspective
the
main
thing
is
that
the
ukrainian
transit
which
is
traditional
for
us
meets
economic
demands
he
said
nord
stream
is
exclusively
an
economic
the
united
states
is
pressing
berlin
to
halt
the
pipeline
that
will
carry
gas
from
russia
under
the
baltic
sea
arguing
it
will
increase
germany
s
dependence
on
russia
for
energy
ukraine
fears
the
pipeline
will
allow
russia
to
cut
it
off
from
the
gas
transit
business
while
germany
s
eastern
european
neighbours
worry
about
russian
encroachment
peskov
said
the
threat
of
possible
sanctions
against
companies
involved
in
the
project
was
not
discussed
on
saturday
standing
beside
putin
before
the
talks
merkel
said
both
countries
but
especially
russia
as
a
permanent
member
of
the
security
council
had
a
responsibility
to
try
to
solve
the
ongoing
fighting
in
ukraine
and
syria
she
said
she
also
planned
to
raise
potentially
thorny
human
rights
issues
with
putin
and
discuss
bilateral
relations
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
controversial
issues
can
only
be
addressed
in
dialogue
and
through
dialogue
she
said
both
leaders
raised
concerns
about
syria
and
the
plight
of
the
many
refugees
created
by
the
war
there
merkel
said
it
was
important
to
avert
a
humanitarian
crisis
in
idlib
syria
and
the
surrounding
region
and
said
she
and
putin
had
already
discussed
the
issue
of
constitutional
reforms
and
possible
elections
when
they
last
met
in
sochi
in
may
putin
told
reporters
that
everything
must
be
done
to
help
syrian
refugees
to
return
to
their
country
and
that
syria
needed
assistance
to
rebuild
the
two
leaders
took
no
questions
on
ukraine
merkel
said
she
hoped
fresh
efforts
could
be
undertaken
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
school
year
to
disentangle
ukrainian
military
forces
and
separatists
on
the
front
lines
in
the
