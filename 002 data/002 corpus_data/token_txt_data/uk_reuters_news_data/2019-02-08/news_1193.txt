a
hardening
of
tehran
s
attitude
towards
france
according
to
an
internal
memo
seen
by

any
hardening
of
relations
with
france
could
have
wider
implications
for
iran
france

been
one

between
iran
and
world
powers

donald
trump
pulled
out
of
in

has
been
hammered

the
prospect
of
the
of
sanctions
that
had
been
lifted
under
the
deal
european
countries
including
france
have
pledged
to
try
to
soften
the

to
persuade
their
firms

defy
washington

rally
held
by
an
exiled
iranian
opposition
group
near

rudy
giuliani
as
a
sign
of
tehran
s
more
aggressive
stance
towards
france
the
behaviour
of
the
iranian
authorities
suggests
a
hardening
of
their
position
our
country
as
well
as
some
of
our
allies
maurice
the
ministry
s
secretary
general
wrote
in

to
officials
in
government
departments
outside
the
foreign
ministry
to
be
passed
on
to
staff
who
intended
to
travel
to
iran
a
separate

showed
the

or
say
whether
embassy
staff
had
been
asked
to
repatriate
their
families
iranian
officials
at
the

did
not
respond

reacting
on

iran
s
foreign
ministry
spokesman
said
iran
should
be
vigilant
against
enemies
trying
to
affect
ties
between
the
countries
the
relations
between
iran
and
europe
especially
iran
and
france
have
some
enemies
and
we
should
be
vigilant
against
their
actions
bahram
qasemi
was
quoted
as
saying
by
the
state
news
agency
irna
the
restriction
on
the
french
diplomats
travel
to
iran
is
not
france
s
latest
travel
advisory
for
its
citizens
published
on
may
cautions
against
visitors
entering
iran
with
electronic
equipment
such
as
drones
and
and
taking
too
many
photographs
the
memo
underscores
how
confidence
in
the
tehran
government
has
been
eroded
in
paris
as
relations
between
the
two
become
increasingly
strained
even
as
president
emmanuel
macron
talks
up
preserving
the
nuclear
accord
iran
has
said
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
alleged
plot
to
attack
a
national
council
of
resistance
of
iran
ncri
meeting
on
june
germany
has
detained
an
iranian
diplomat
based
in
austria
belgium
where
the
plot
was
uncovered
has
sought
the
diplomat
s
extradition
french
officials
have
not
commented
on
the
matter
but
diplomatic
sources
have
said
privately
that
if
iran
s
involvement
were
proven
then
it
would
be
difficult
for
france
not
to
react
strongly
since
pulling
out
of
the
nuclear
accord
trump
has
expressed
a
readiness
to
negotiate
a
new
deal
while
warning
tehran
of
dire
consequences
the
like
of
which
few
throughout
history
have
suffered
before
if
it
made
threats
against
the
united
states
it
was
macron
who
led
efforts
to
persuade
trump
to
stick
with
the
agreement
arguing
it
was
the
best
means
western
powers
had
to
check
iran
s
nuclear
activities
rouhani
on
monday
urged
the
remaining
signatories
to
the
nuclear
agreement
to
act
to
save
the
pact
macron
reiterated
france
s
commitment
to
maintaining
the
accord
but
europe
s
leaders
have
appeared
powerless
to
prevent
the
sanctions
inflicting
pain
on
iran
s
economy
the
ministry
memo
said
any
staffer
who
travelled
to
iran
for
personal
reasons
would
not
be
shielded
by
diplomatic
immunity
even
if
holding
a
diplomatic
passport
it
made
specific
reference
to
tourism
and
language
classes
britain
s
foreign
ministry
said
its
advice
on
iran
to
diplomats
was
the
same
as
to
the
british
public
it
flags
the
risks
of
terrorist
attacks
and
arbitrary
detentions
and
advises
against
all
travel
to
the
frontiers
with
iraq
and
afghanistan
