mounting
pressure

reports
of
vehicles
catching
fires
the
recall
headache
adds
to
a
plethora
of
issues
at
hyundai
which
had
counted
on
new
suvs
to
engineer
a
recovery

of
annual

declines
stemming

shares
of
affiliate
kia

slumped
percent
a
consumer
advocate
group
this
month
called
for
an
expansion
of
the
recall
which
was
announced
by
the
south
korean
duo
last
year
citing
a
surge
in
fire
complaints
a
senate
committee
asked
hyundai
and
kia
executives
to
testify
at
a
hearing
next
month
a
south
korean
whistleblower
in
reported
concerns
about
engine
defects
to
the
safety
regulator
which
has
subsequently
launched
a
probe
into
the
timeliness
of
the
recalls
and
whether
they
covered
enough
vehicles
transportation
authorities
in
the
and
other
countries
are
taking
a
more
rigorous
and
detailed
look
at
quality
matters
than
in
the
past
lee
hyang
head
of
global
quality
strategy
division
said
during
a
conference
call
with
analysts
we
are
continuing
efforts
to
minimise
additional
quality
problems
going
forward
he
added
the
charge
will
also
cover
expenses
related
to
new
technology
aimed
at
detecting
engine
defects
that
will
be
used
in
upcoming
and
some
existing
models
the
costs
were
too
big
and
the
question
is
whether
the
costs
will
be
just
or
whether
there
will
be
more
to
come
said
jung
an
auto
analyst
at
shinhan
investment
securities
adding
that
he
did
not
expect
a
meaningful
earnings
recovery
in
the
near
term
hyundai
also
said
sharp
drops
in
currencies
of
emerging
markets
such
as
turkey
and
russia
weighed
on
its
bottom
line
hyundai
said
escalating
trade
wars
and
slowing
growth
in
china
and
the
united
states
cloud
the
industry
outlook
but
predicted
its
profit
would
rebound
in
the
fourth
quarter
helped
by
new
suvs
it
did
not
elaborate
hyundai
had
been
counting
on
its
new
santa
fe
suv
to
turn
around
its
flagging
fortunes
in
the
united
states
where
it
had
missed
out
on
a
suv
boom
due
to
its
heavy
reliance
on
sedans
but
its
retail
sales
rose
only
percent
in
the
third
quarter
sales
in
china
declined
percent
despite
an
agreement
between
seoul
and
beijing
last
year
to
normalise
ties
putting
a
diplomatic
row
that
had
hit
sales
of
south
korean
goods
behind
them
the
automaker
said
santa
fe
sales
should
increase
gradually
the
initial
response
for
the
santa
fe
is
positive
said
koo
zayong
head
of
investor
relations
adding
the
model
will
raise
the
utilisation
rate
of
its
factory
to
above
percent
in
the
fourth
quarter
from
the
s
percent
hyundai
is
also
bracing
for
a
decision
from
the
united
states
as
to
whether
it
will
slap
tariffs
on
imports
of
vehicles
and
vehicle
parts
south
korea
has
argued
it
should
get
tariff
exemptions
saying
it
has
already
made
concessions
in
the
auto
sector
after
a
bilateral
deal
was
revised
last
month
