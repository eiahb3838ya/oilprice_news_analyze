persistence
paid
off
when
she
knocked
on
the
door
of
jose
alberto
and
norma
moreno
mexican
immigrants
who
are
now
citizens

he
had
no

i
don
t
believe
in
any
of
that
all
politicians
are
liars

moreno
who
works
at
a
furniture
warehouse
but
nevarez
insisted
engaging
him
in
a
conversation
that
eventually
turned
to
healthcare
moreno

main
concern
after
a
few
minutes
he
agreed
to

i
m
going
to
do
it
now

a
drive
in
states
america
s
million
latinos
account
for
nearly
percent
of
eligible
voters
this
year
but
their
turnout
rate
has
declined
since
according
to
the
pew
research
centre
only
percent
of
eligible
latinos
voted
in
the
last
midterm
elections
in
and
only
percent
of
those
aged
to
pew
said
some
activists
said
they
were
motivated
by
watching
joe
arpaio
a
former
arizona
sheriff
whose
policies
brought
his
office
penalties
for
racial
profiling
and
eventually
a
contempt
of
court
conviction
he
maintained
that
the
prosecution
was
political
aimed
at
helping
oust
him
from
office
trump
later
pardoned
him
we
have
seen
an
igniting
of
fear
division
and
violence
under
this
trump
administration
but
that
s
not
new
to
arizona
