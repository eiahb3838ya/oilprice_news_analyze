skim
milk
proteins
and
other
components
and
ultrafiltered
milk
within
months
after

goes
into

farmers
said
those
schedules
had
effectively
pushed
them
out
of
the
canadian
dairy
market
the
agreement
will
increase
access
to
canada
s
dairy
market
beyond
partnership
levels
a
senior
trump
administration
official
said

will
preserve

from
tariffs

appear
to
have
been
made
to

chapter
trade
dispute
settlement

the
dispute
settlement
however
the

to
preferential
treatment
cases
and
certain
sectors
dominated
by
state
firms
such
as
energy
and
telecoms
and
infrastructure
keeping
chapter
will
not
affect
washington
s
enforcement
of
and
laws
said
a
official
a
to
the
agreement
showed
that
trump
preserved
the
ability
to
impose
threatened
percent
global
tariffs
on
autos
while
largely
exempting
passenger
vehicles
pickup
trucks
and
auto
parts
from
canada
and
mexico
if
trump
imposes
section
autos
tariffs
on
national
security
grounds
mexico
and
canada
would
each
get
a
passenger
vehicle
quota
of
million
passenger
vehicles
exported
to
the
united
states
annually
well
above
their
current
export
levels
pickup
trucks
built

both
countries
will
be
exempted
entirely
additionally
mexico

annually
while
canada
will
get
a
parts
quota
of
billion
annually
in
the
event
of
autos
tariffs
the
deal
set
a
transition
period
after
the
agreement
enters
into
force
for
the
regional
value
content
requirement
for
autos
to
increase
to
percent
from
a
current
percent
it
requires
percent
of
vehicles
value

be
made
in
high

areas
paying
an
hour
requiring
significant
automotive
production
in
the
united
states
and
canada
the
pact
also
requires
that
vehicle
manufacturers
source
at
least
percent
of
their
steel
and
aluminium
from
within
the
three
countries
reflecting
the
concerns
of
mexico
s
incoming
government
that
the
agreement
would
limit
the
country
s
control
over
its
oil
resources
the
deal
states
that
mexico
has
the
direct
inalienable
and
imprescriptible
ownership
of
all
hydrocarbons
in
its
subsoil
despite
the
strongly
worded
language
the
energy
chapter
does
not
prevent
foreign
oil
companies
from
producing
oil
in
mexico
under
a
liberalisation
of
the
industry
passed
by
the
outgoing
government
