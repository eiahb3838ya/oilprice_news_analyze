reuters
president
donald
trump
gave
saudi
arabia
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
the
disappearance
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
even
as
lawmakers
pointed
the
finger
at
the
saudi
leadership
and
western
pressure
mounted
on
riyadh
to
provide
answers
i
think
we
have
to
find
out
what
happened
first
trump
told
the
associated
press
in
an
interview
on
tuesday
here
we
go
again
with
you
know
you
re
guilty
until
proven
innocent
i
don
t
like
trump
then
referred
directly
to
his
nomination
of
brett
kavanaugh
to
the
supreme
court
which
ran
into
trouble
in
the
senate
after
several
women
came
forward
to
accuse
kavanaugh
of
sexual
misconduct
before
kavanaugh
was
ultimately
confirmed
earlier
in
a
twitter
post
trump
said
that
saudi
arabian
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
denied
knowing
what
happened
in
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
where
khashoggi
vanished
two
weeks
ago
after
going
there
to
collect
documents
he
needed
for
his
planned
marriage
turkish
officials
have
said
they
believe
the
saudi
journalist
was
murdered
and
his
body
removed
which
the
saudis
have
strongly
denied
khashoggi
was
a
resident
who
wrote
columns
for
the
washington
post
and
he
was
critical
of
the
saudi
government
calling
for
reforms
just
spoke
with
the
crown
prince
of
saudi
arabia
who
totally
denied
any
knowledge
of
what
took
place
in
their
turkish
consulate
trump
wrote
on
twitter
trump
also
wrote
that
the
crown
prince
told
me
that
he
has
already
started
and
will
rapidly
expand
a
full
and
complete
investigation
into
this
matter
answers
will
be
forthcoming
how
the
crown
prince
often
referred
to
as
mbs
emerges
when
the
dust
settles
over
khashoggi
s
disappearance
is
a
test
of
how
the
west
will
deal
with
saudi
arabia
in
the
future
at
issue
will
be
to
what
extent
the
west
believes
responsibility
lies
with
mbs
for
khashoggi
mbs
who
has
enjoyed
a
close
relationship
with
the
trump
administration
painted
himself
as
the
face
of
a
new
vibrant
saudi
arabia
diversifying
its
economy
away
from
reliance
on
oil
and
making
some
social
changes
but
there
has
been
mounting
criticism
of
some
of
the
prince
s
moves
these
include
riyadh
s
involvement
in
the
war
in
yemen
the
arrest
of
women
activists
and
a
diplomatic
dispute
with
canada
the
kingdom
also
denied
an
assertion
by
france
that
it
held
lebanese
prime
minister
saad
captive
in
november
despite
western
concerns
about
saudi
arabia
s
human
rights
record
trump
still
says
he
is
unwilling
to
pull
out
of
weapons
sales
agreements
with
riyadh
also
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
plans
to
attend
a
investment
conference
in
riyadh
starting
on
those
are
all
indications
trump
is
sticking
by
saudi
arabia
the
first
country
he
visited
as
president
in
trump
told
the
ap
that
mnuchin
s
trip
could
be
cancelled
by
friday
depending
on
what
the
investigation
finds
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
who
met
with
saudi
king
salman
the
crown
prince
and
the
foreign
minister
said
his
assessment
from
the
meetings
was
that
there
was
a
serious
commitment
to
determine
all
the
facts
and
ensure
accountability
including
accountability
for
saudi
arabia
s
senior
leaders
or
senior
officials
pompeo
is
due
to
travel
to
turkey
on
wednesday
pompeo
and
trump
s
remarks
reflect
a
dilemma
for
the
united
states
britain
and
other
western
nations
in
how
to
respond
to
an
authoritarian
monarchy
that
does
not
typically
bow
to
foreign
pressures
saudi
arabia
is
the
world
s
top
oil
exporter
spends
lavishly
on
western
arms
and
is
a
major
sunni
muslim
ally
senator
lindsey
graham
a
republican
close
to
trump
on
some
issues
called
the
crown
prince
a
toxic
figure
adding
he
can
never
be
a
world
leader
on
the
world
i
ve
been
their
biggest
defender
on
the
floor
of
the
united
states
senate
graham
said
this
guy
is
a
wrecking
ball
he
had
this
guy
murdered
in
a
consulate
in
turkey
and
to
expect
me
to
ignore
it
i
feel
used
and
abused
graham
said
the
group
of
seven
foreign
ministers
including
the
united
states
said
in
a
statement
that
they
remained
very
troubled
by
khashoggi
s
disappearance
and
looked
forward
to
riyadh
conducting
a
thorough
credible
transparent
and
prompt
investigation
as
the
statement
was
unusual
for
a
group
that
normally
weighs
in
on
global
foreign
policy
issues
and
speaks
generally
about
human
rights
abuses
in
other
countries
media
outlets
reported
on
monday
that
saudi
arabia
will
acknowledge
that
khashoggi
was
killed
in
a
botched
interrogation
trump
speculated
on
monday
that
rogue
killers
could
be
behind
the
disappearance
but
gave
no
evidence
to
back
up
that
theory
members
of
the
congress
including
some
of
trump
s
fellow
republicans
are
among
the
loudest
voices
in
the
united
states
demanding
answers
and
action
on
khashoggi
who
moved
to
washington
last
year
fearing
retribution
for
his
criticism
of
the
crown
prince
republican
representative
jeb
hensarling
outgoing
chairman
of
the
house
of
representatives
financial
services
committee
said
washington
might
have
to
seriously
review
relations
with
saudi
arabia
if
riyadh
was
involved
in
killing
khashoggi
if
this
was
a
assassination
which
it
may
prove
to
be
then
there
will
have
to
be
a
fundamental
rethinking
of
our
relationship
the
kingdom
of
saudi
arabia
absolutely
hensarling
told
reuters
turkish

tayyip
