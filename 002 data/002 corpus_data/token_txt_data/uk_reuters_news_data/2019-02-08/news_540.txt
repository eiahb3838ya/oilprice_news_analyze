its
worst
political
crisis
in
decades
over
the
killing
of
khashoggi
at
riyadh
s
consulate
in
istanbul
early
last
month
which
has
damaged
the
kingdom
s
standing
and
strained
its
ties
with
the

mohammed
said
the
refusal
of
saudi
arabia
and
its
arab
allies
to
end
a
political
and
economic
boycott
of
qatar
was
recklessness
that
risked
regional
security

arabia
the
united
arab

bahrain

egypt
cut
trade
and
transport
ties
with
qatar
in

their
foe

the
boycott
aims
to
impinge
on
its
sovereignty
we
still
see
them
saudis

emiratis
continuing
with
the
same
behaviour
continuing
not

be
responsive
to
any
attempt
of
the
international
community
to
end
the
conflict
he
said
the
united

has
increased
pressure
on
riyadh
to
end
its
protracted
dispute
with
qatar
following
khashoggi
s
killing
to
restore
gulf
unity
which
washington
sees
as
essential
to
containing
iranian
influence
in
the
region
shiekh
mohammed
said
qatar
would
continue
to
deal
with
iran
which
helped
doha
secure
supplies
when
the
boycott
was
first
imposed
and
was
ready
to
mediate
between
washington
and
tehran
there
is
this
dispute
between
and
iran
it
s
putting
us
in
a
situation
in
which
we
see
a
disagreement
between
our
strongest
ally
and
our
neighbour
which
is
not
comfortable
he
said
there
should
be
a
way
to
find
a
bridge
to
mediate
this
problem
if
qatar
can
provide
this
bridge
