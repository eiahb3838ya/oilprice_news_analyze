s
newspaper
on
sunday
accused
the

and
hatching
a
criminal
plot
against
pyongyang
after
washington
abruptly
cancelled
a
visit
by
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
negotiations
have
been
all
but
deadlocked
since
president
donald
trump
s
summit
with
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
in
singapore
in
june
pompeo
has
pressed
for
tangible
steps
toward
north
korea

abandonment
of
its
nuclear

while
pyongyang
is
demanding
that
washington
first
make
concessions
of
its

s
rodong
sinmun
newspaper
said
special
units
based
in
japan
were
staging
an
air
drill
aimed
at
the
infiltration
into
pyongyang
citing
a
south
korean
media
outlet
such
acts
prove
that
the
is
hatching
a
criminal
plot
to
unleash
a
war
against
the
dprk
and
commit
a
crime
which
deserves
merciless
divine
punishment
in
case
the
fails
in
the
scenario
of
the
dprk
s
unjust
and
brigandish
denuclearisation
first
the
paper
said
we
can
not
but
take
a
serious
note
of
the
attitudes
of
the
as
it
is
busy
staging
secret
drills
involving
special
units
while
having
a
dialogue
with
a
smile
on
its
face
it
noted
a
spokesman
at
the
embassy
in
seoul
said
he
had
no
information
on
the
drill
alleged
in
the
newspaper
the
military
spokesman
in
south
korea
was
not
immediately
available
to
comment
the
editorial
which
did
not
mention
the
pompeo
visit
urged
washington
to
give
up
the
pointless
military
gamble
and
implement
the
singapore
agreement
in
which
the
leaders
pledged
to
work
towards
a
complete
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
since
the
summit
the
two
sides
have
struggled
to
narrow
differences
over
the
north
s
nuclear
weapons
programme
pyongyang
is
calling
for
a
declaration
of
peace
as
part
of
security
guarantees
designed
to
encourage
it
to
abandon
its
nuclear
weapons
and
ballistic
missiles
while
the
trump
administration
says
a
peace
deal
and
other
concessions
will
only
come
after
more
progress
on
denuclearisation
in
part
to
reassure
north
korea
trump
cancelled
or
delayed
joint
military
drills
with
south
korea
but
smaller
exercises
continue
trump
partly
blamed
china
for
the
lack
of
progress
with
north
korea
and
suggested
that
talks
with
pyongyang
could
be
on
hold
until
after
washington
resolved
its
bitter
trade
dispute
with
beijing
china
expressed
serious
concern
about
trump
s
comments
which
it
called
irresponsible
