london
reuters
lloyds
banking
group
and
schroders
said
on
tuesday
they
had
struck
a
pound
wealth
management
deal
aimed
at
changing
the
way
britons
save
and
invest
schroders
britain
s
second
largest
listed
fund
management
group
by
assets
under
management
and
lloyds
its
biggest
retail
lender
said
they
would
launch
a
financial
planning
joint
venture
after
confirming
earlier
this
month
they
were
in
talks
the
deal
the
highest
profile
of
its
kind
between
a
british
bank
and
fund
manager
combines
schroders
investment
offering
with
lloyds
customer
base
and
wide
distribution
network
it
revives
a
traditional
partnership
model
between
banks
and
insurers
that
has
dominated
in
mainland
europe
for
decades
the
aim
is
to
become
a
top
three
uk
financial
planning
business
within
five
years
said
antonio
lorenzo
director
of
insurance
and
wealth
at
lloyds
and
chief
executive
of
its
subsidiary
scottish
widows
the
bank
launched
a
renewed
push
into
insurance
and
wealth
earlier
this
year
it
is
already
a
market
leader
in
its
core
products
like
mortgages
and
the
limited
opportunity
for
growth
in
key
markets
has
helped
drag
its
share
price
down
percent
this
year
for
schroders
the
deal
is
likely
to
boost
its
ability
to
sell
its
broad
range
of
equity
and
fixed
income
products
to
lloyds
customers
and
is
the
latest
move
in
a
plan
to
diversify
its
revenues
we
think
this
move
makes
good
sense
for
both
parties
bernstein
analyst
edward
houghton
said
of
the
deal
which
follows
a
series
of
mergers
and
in
the
asset
management
sector
schroders
shares
were

lloyds
ceo
antonio
and
schroders
chief
executive
peter
harrison
welcomed
the
deal
under
which
lloyds
will
own
percent
of
the
new
entity
and
schroders
percent
the
venture
whose
branding
was
not
outlined
in
the
statement
will
be
led
by
a
management
team
compromising
representatives
from
both
parties
lloyds
lorenzo
will
be
its
chairman
while
james
rainbow
schroders
of
uk
intermediary
will
be
its
chief
executive
schroders
also
won
an
investment
contract
from
lloyds
billion
of
which
represents
a
large
part
of
the
mandate
that
lloyds
pulled
from
previous
manager
standard
life
aberdeen
earlier
this
year
the
assets
previously
managed
by
sla
are
subject
to
arbitration
after
sla
disputed
lloyds
right
to
terminate
the
contract
however
the
statement
said
they
will
transfer

schroders
whatever
the
outcome
of
this
process
either
once
arbitration
concludes
or
when
the
bank
s
contract
with
sla
expires
in
march
and
remain
with
the
firm
for
at
least
five
years
lloyds
has
been
using
negotiations
over
the
mandate
to
leverage
partnerships
that
support
its
push
into
the
sector
it
also
handed
billion
pounds
of
the
