another

want
for

future
state
israeli
police
said
they
shot
dead
an
arab
who
attacked

s
deaths
brought
to
the
number
of
palestinians
killed
by
israeli
forces
since
the
weekly
protests
began
on
march
the
campaign
is
pressing
for
rights
to
land
that
palestinians
lost
to
israel
in
the
war
of
its
foundation
and
for
an
end
to
the
blockade
of
gaza
anger
in
gaza
has
also
been
stoked
by
funding
cuts
by
the
administration
of
palestinian
president
mahmoud
abbas
which
dominates
the
west
bank
and
is
the
rival
of
hamas
which
runs
gaza
their
efforts
at
agreeing
on
a
unity
deal
with
egyptian
mediation
have
not
borne
fruit

no
immediate
comment

incidents
hamas
official
izzat
reshiq
said
the
group
and
other
palestinian
factions
concluded
a
round
of
talks
with
egyptian
security
officials
over
a
possible
truce
with
israel
and
that
further
talks
were
scheduled
for
later
this
month
efforts
will
resume
after
the
holiday
of
eid
reshiq
said
on
twitter
referring
to
a
muslim
festival
that
begins
on
and
ends
on
israel
sees
the
gaza
protests
as
a
bid
by
hamas
against
which
it
has
fought
three
wars
in
the
last
decade
to
use
civilians
as
cover
for
attacks
hamas
denies
this
separately
israeli
police
said
they
were
attacked
on
friday
by
a
man
after
he
emerged
from
a
complex
housing
al
aqsa
mosque
islam
s
shrine
in

jerusalem
the
man
was
shot
dead

said
describing
him
as
a
resident
of
an
israeli
arab
town
where
sympathies
are
strong
cctv
video
from
the
scene
showed
a
man
lunging
at
a
police
trooper
with
a
knife
but
not
what
followed
palestinians
said
that
after
the
incident
israeli
authorities
barred
muslim
worshippers
from
al
aqsa
mosque
this
is
a
grave
escalation
that
may
lead
to
unpredictable
consequences
