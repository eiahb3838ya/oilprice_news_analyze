vests
took
to
motorway
sliproads
tunnel
entrances
or
airport
access
roads
the
demonstrations
coordinated
on
social
media
were
born
out
of
a
backlash
against
higher
fuel
prices
and
echo
complaints
about
a
perceived
squeeze
in
spending
power
and
mounting
dissatisfaction
with
macron
who
some
view
as
out
of
touch
with
ordinary
people
at
a
blockade
in
the
southeastern
department
of
savoie
a
driver
panicked
when
protesters
surrounded
her
car
and
she
accelerated
hitting
and
killing
a
female
demonstrator
french
interior

demonstrators

serious
injuries
by

people
had
been
taken
into

some
demonstrators
were
still
in
place
at
nightfall
police
used
tear
gas
to
clear
the
entrance
to
a
tunnel
under
the
mountain
in
the
alps
and
to
push
back
demonstrators
near
the
elysee
palace
in
paris
and
in
the
centre
of
lyon
protestors
chanted
macron
resign
and
some
sported
slogans
such
as
give
us
back
our
purchasing
power
on
the
back
of
the
yellow
vests
which
have
come
to
symbolise
the
movement
there
are
just
too
many
taxes
in
france
said
veronique
lestrade
a
demonstrator
on
the
outskirts
of
paris
who
said
her
family
was
struggling
to
make
ends
meet
in
months
in
power
macron
has
seen
off
trade
unions
and
street
demonstrations
as
he
loosened
labour
laws
and
overhauled
the
heavily
indebted
state
rail
operator
sncf
in
a
bid
to
reboot
the
economy
derided
by
political
opponents
as
the
president
of
the
rich
for
measures
such
as
the
end
of
a
wealth
tax
macron
s
popularity
has
dwindled
to
new
lows
of
percent
tax
hikes
on
fuel
and
tobacco
as
well
as
an
increase
to
a
social
welfare
levy
before
other
tax
cuts
came
into
force
have
left
some
voters
feeling
squeezed
the
diesel
tax
increases
designed
to
encourage
drivers
to
switch
to
more
cars
were
approved
in
late
but
began
to
bite
when
oil
prices
surged
in
october
angering
some
in
the
provinces
who
rely
on
their
cars
to
get
to
work
ministers
announced
funds
last
wednesday
to
help
motorists
on
the
lowest
incomes
even
if
macron
is
standing
firm
on
his
fuel
policy
prices
have
eased
this
month
although
protestors
on
saturday
had
other
complaints
too
as
macron
s
next
test
at
the
ballot
box
in
european
parliamentary
elections
in
may
looms
i
happily
voted
for
macron
in
but
he
s
really
making
fun
of
us
said
dominique
jouvert
a
retired
civil
servant
demonstrating
in
lyon
there
s
no
discussion
to
be
had
with
him
no
dialogue
he
s
arrogant
what
s
certain
is
that
i
won
t
vote
for
him
