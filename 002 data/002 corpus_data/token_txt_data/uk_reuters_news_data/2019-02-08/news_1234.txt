reuters
the
jury
in
the
trial
of
paul
manafort
would
have
convicted
the
former
trump
campaign
chairman
on
all
criminal
charges
if
not
for
one
juror
who
had
questions
about
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
of
guilt
a
juror
told
fox
news
on
wednesday
there
was
one
holdout
the
juror
in
the
trial
paula
duncan
said
in
an
interview
we
all
tried
to
convince
her
to
look
at
the
paper
trail
we
laid
it
out
in
front
of
her
again
and
again
and
she
still
said
that
she
had
a
reasonable
the
jury
on
tuesday
found
manafort
guilty
on
two
counts
of
bank
fraud
five
counts
of
tax
fraud
and
one
charge
of
failing
to
disclose
foreign
bank
accounts
giving
special
counsel
robert
mueller
a
victory
in
the
first
trial
arising
from
his
investigation
of
russia
s
role
in
the
election
but
the
jury
of
six
men
and
six
women
could
not
reach
a
consensus
on
other
counts
judge
ellis
who
oversaw
the
trial
in
a
federal
court
in
alexandria
virginia
declared
a
mistrial
on
those
counts
in
the
first
public
comments
by
a
juror
in
the
case
duncan
said
that
members
of
the
jury
were
in
agreement
that
manafort
was
guilty
on
all
felony
charges
but
that
they
could
not
get
the
one
holdout
to
change
her
mind
after
nearly
four
days
of
deliberations
we
didn
t
want
it
to
be
hung
so
we
tried
for
an
extended
period
of
time
to
convince
her
but
in
the
end
she
held
out
and
that
s
why
we
have
counts
that
did
not
get
a
verdict
she
said
duncan
said
she
was
speaking
out
to
inform
the
public
and
that
she
was
not
concerned
about
her
safety
ellis
said
that
he
had
received
threats
and
he
has
not
released
juror
names
citing
worries
about
their
safety
i
thought
that
the
public
america
needed
to
know
how
close
this
was
and
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
she
said
duncan
said
she
was
a
trump
supporter
and
wanted
to
believe
that
manafort
was
innocent
she
noted
that
even
his
critics
had
described
him
as
a
brilliant
political
consultant
and
that
trump
had
trusted
him
with
overseeing
his
campaign
i
did
not
want
paul
manafort
to
be
guilty
but
he
was
and
no
one
is
above
the
duncan
said
some
of
the
jurors
had
a
problem
accepting
the
testimony
of
rick
gates
manafort
s
former
man
because
he
was
testifying
as
part
of
a
plea
deal
and
would
have
done
anything
that
he
could
to
preserve
she
said
the
jury
decided
to
not
consider
gates
testimony
and
focus
instead
on
the
documentary
evidence
duncan
had
tough
words
for
attorneys
on
both
sides
she
said
the
prosecution
looked
bored
at
times
and
that
she
saw
two
of
them
napping
manafort
s
lawyers
on
the
other
hand
gave
short
rarely
objected
and
gave
off
an
easy
going
vibe
she
said
i
think
i
expected
a
little
more
duncan
said
duncan
said
the
deliberations
were
heated
at
times
leading
some
jurors
to
tears
at
one
point
but
that
politics
did
not
influence
their
i
think
we
all
went
in
there
like
we
were
supposed
to
and
assumed
that
mr
manafort
was
innocent
we
did
due
diligence
we
applied
the
evidence
our
notes
the
witnesses
and
we
came
out
with
guilty
verdicts
on
the
eight
counts
