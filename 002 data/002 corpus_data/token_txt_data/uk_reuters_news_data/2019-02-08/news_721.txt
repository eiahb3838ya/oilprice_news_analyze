in

the

some
this

a

reported
an

by
the

weighed
on

hit
sales
of
luxury

maserati
the

s
margins
fell
to
percent
from

last

manley
said
he
saw
significant
upside
for
europe
in
future
he
also
expects
progress
at
maserati
in
the
second
half
of
next
year
adding
the
product
remained
competitive
but
was
plagued
by
issues
related
to
how
it
was
positioned
and
managed
fca
expects
to
take
a
hit
of
around
million
euros
from
higher
steel
and
aluminium
prices
this
year
and
a
similar
impact
in
group
net
profit
in
the
quarter
was
down
percent
as
fca
set
aside
million
euros
to
cover
potential
costs
related
to
talks
with
authorities
over
suspected
diesel
emissions
violations
which
fca
denies
the
charge
does
not
represent
an
agreed
settlement
nor
is
an
admission
of
liability
fca
added
this
provision
sits
someway
below
most
expectations
of
a
figure
in
excess
of
