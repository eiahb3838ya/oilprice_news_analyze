ecb keeps policy unchanged even as growth wanes
frankfurt
reuters
the
european
central
bank
kept
its
policy
unchanged
as
expected
on
thursday
staying
on
course
to
end
bond
purchases
by
the
end
of
december
and
to
raise
rates
sometime
after
next
summer
with
inflation
rebounding
and
growth
on
a
run
the
ecb
has
been
removing
stimulus
for
much
of
this
year
even
if
more
recent
growth
indicators
appear
to
show
that
the
expansion
is
running
out
of
steam
and
risks
to
the
outlook
are
mounting
but
with
the
bank
having
already
exhausted
much
of
its
firepower
the
threshold
for
any
extension
of
its
stimulus
is
high
requiring
a
major
shock
rather
than
the
gradual
slowdown
that
has
characterized
this
year
the
bank
also
made
no
change
to
its
policy
guidance
first
formulated
in
june
and
kept
broadly
unchanged
through
several
meetings
the
governing
council
expects
the
key
ecb
interest
rates
to
remain
at
their
present
levels
at
least
through
the
summer
of
and
in
any
case
for
as
long
as
necessary
it
said
repeating
its
guidance
attention
now
turns
to
ecb
president
mario
draghi
s
gmt
news
conference
at
which
he
is
likely
to
discuss
the
broader
economic
outlook
and
will
be
questioned
about
italy
s
budget
fight
with
the
european
commission
investors
will
also
look
to
see
if
draghi
maintains
the
ecb
s
stance
that
growth
risks
are
broadly
balanced
or
takes
a
more
dovish
view
given
a
string
of
disappointing
data
with
thursday
s
decision
the
ecb
s
rate
on
bank
overnight
deposits
which
is
currently
its
primary
interest
rate
tool
remains
at
percent
the
main
refinancing
rate
which
determines
the
cost
of
credit
in
the
economy
remained
unchanged
at
percent
while
the
rate
on
the
marginal
lending
facility
the
emergency
overnight
borrowing
rate
for
banks
remains
at
percent
