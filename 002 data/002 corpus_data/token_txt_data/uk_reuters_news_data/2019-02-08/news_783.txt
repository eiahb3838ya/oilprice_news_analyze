trump's missile treaty pullout could escalate tension with china
washington
reuters
a
withdrawal
from
a
cold
nuclear
arms
treaty
with
russia
could
give
the
pentagon
new
options
to
counter
chinese
missile
advances
but
experts
warn
the
ensuing
arms
race
could
greatly
escalate
tensions
in
the
officials
have
been
warning
for
years
that
the
united
states
was
being
put
at
a
disadvantage
by
china
s
development
of
increasingly
sophisticated
missile
forces
which
the
pentagon
could
not
match
thanks
to
the
treaty
with
russia
president
donald
trump
has
signalled
he
may
soon
give
the
pentagon
a
freer
hand
to
confront
those
advances
if
he
makes
good
on
threats
to
pull
out
of
the
nuclear
forces
treaty
which
required
elimination
of
and
nuclear
and
conventional
missiles
dan
blumenthal
a
former
pentagon
official
now
at
the
american
enterprise
institute
said
a
treaty
pullout
could
pave
the
way
for
the
united
states
to
field
conventional
missiles
in
places
like
guam
and
japan
that
would
make
it
harder
for
china
to
consider
a
conventional
first
strike
against
ships
and
bases
in
the
region
it
could
also
force
beijing
into
a
costly
arms
race
forcing
china
to
spend
more
on
missile
defences
it
will
change
the
picture
fundamentally
blumenthal
said
even
as
trump
has
blamed
russian
violations
of
the
treaty
for
his
decision
he
has
also
pointed
a
finger
at
china
beijing
was
not
party
to
the
inf
treaty
and
has
been
fielding
new
and
more
deadly
missile
forces
these
include
china
s
ballistic
missile
irbm
which
has
a
maximum
range
of
km
miles
and
which
the
pentagon
says
can
threaten
land
and
forces
as
far
away
as
the
pacific
island
of
guam
it
was
first
fielded
in
if
russia
is
doing
it
developing
these
missiles
and
china
is
doing
it
and
we
re
adhering
to
the
agreement
that
s
unacceptable
trump
said
on
sunday
john
bolton
white
house
national
security
advisor
noted
that
recent
chinese
statements
suggest
it
wanted
washington
to
stay
in
the
treaty
and
that
s
perfectly
understandable
if
i
were
chinese
i
would
say
the
same
thing
he
told
the
echo
moskvy
radio
station
why
not
have
the
americans
bound
and
the
chinese
not
bound
officials
have
so
far
relied
on
other
capabilities
as
a
to
china
like
missiles
fired
from
ships
or
aircraft
but
advocates
for
a
missile
response
say
that
is
the
best
way
to
deter
chinese
use
of
its
muscular
missile
forces
kelly
magsamen
who
helped
craft
the
pentagon
s
asian
policy
under
the
obama
administration
said
china
s
ability
to
work
outside
of
the
inf
treaty
had
vexed
policymakers
in
washington
long
before
trump
came
into
office
but
she
cautioned
that
any
new
policy
guiding
missile
deployments
in
asia
would
need
to
be
carefully
coordinated
with
allies
something
that
does
not
appear
to
have
happened
yet
mismanagement
of
expectations
surrounding
a
treaty
pullout
could
also
unsettle
security
in
the
she
cautioned
it
s
potentially
destabilising
she
said
experts
warn
that
china
would
put
pressure
on
countries
in
the
region
to
refuse
requests
to
position
missiles
there
abraham
denmark
a
former
senior
pentagon
official
under
obama
said
guam
japan
and
even
australia
were
possible
locations
for
missile
deployments
but
there
are
a
lot
of
alliance
questions
that
appear
at
first
glance
to
be
very
tricky
he
cautioned
still
current
and
former
officials
say
washington
is
right
to
focus
on
china
s
missile
threat
harry
harris
who
led
military
forces
in
the
pacific
before
becoming
ambassador
to
seoul
said
earlier
this
year
that
the
united
states
was
at
a
disadvantage
we
have
no
missile
capability
that
can
threaten
china
because
of
among
other
things
our
rigid
adherence
to
the
treaty
harris
told
a
senate
hearing
in
march
without
calling
for
the
treaty
to
be
scrapped
asked
about
trump
s
comments
china
s
foreign
ministry
said
a
unilateral
withdrawal
would
have
a
negative
impact
and
urged
the
united
states
to
think
thrice
before
talking
about
china
on
the
issue
of
unilaterally
pulling
out
of
the
treaty
is
completely
mistaken
