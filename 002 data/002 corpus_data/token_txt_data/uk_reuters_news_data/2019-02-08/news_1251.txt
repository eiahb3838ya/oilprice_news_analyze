they
were
not
issued
with
documents
when
they
came
to
the
country
from
the
caribbean
after
world
war
two
the
scandal
damaged
the
authority
of
prime

theresa
may
who
had
led
efforts
to

illegal
immigration
when
she
led
the
home
office

thousands

such
as
the
empire
windrush
had
been
appalling

were
completely
unacceptable

personally
apologise
to
those
identified
in
our
review
and
am
committed
to
providing
them
with
the
support
and
compensation
they
deserve
he
said
on
tuesday
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
ensure
that
nothing
like
this
happens
again
which
is
why
i
have
asked
an
independent
adviser
to
look
at
what
lessons
we
can
learn
from
the
government
also
said
people
were
either
detained
or
removed
because
they
had
lost
their
entitlement
to
stay
in
britain
after
leaving
for
more
than
two
years
and
a
further
people
were
detained
temporarily
at
port
but
allowed
to
enter
a
set
up
after
the
scandal
had
helped
people
to
get
the
documentation
they
needed
to
prove
their
existing
right
to
be
in
the
uk
the
government
said
a
further
people
had
been
granted
citizenship
or
documentation
to
prove
their
status
under
a
formal
windrush
scheme
