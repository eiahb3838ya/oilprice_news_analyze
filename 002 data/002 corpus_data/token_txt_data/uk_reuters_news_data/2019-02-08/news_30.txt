exclusive-russia's sechin raises pressure on putin to end opec deal
moscow
reuters
igor
sechin
head
of
russian
oil
giant
rosneft
and
one
of
vladimir
putin
s
closest
allies
has
written
to
the
russian
president
saying
moscow
s
deal
with
opec
to
cut
oil
output
is
a
strategic
threat
and
plays
into
the
hands
of
the
united
states
the
letter
did
not
say
whether
the
agreement
in
place
since
between
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
other
large
oil
producers
led
by
russia
to
cut
output
should
be
extended
or
not
but
according
to
two
industry
sources
the
letter
was
a
clear
signal
to
other
senior
russian
officials
involved
in
energy
policy
that
sechin
wants
the
deal
to
come
to
an
end
there
is
no
guarantee
putin
will
back
sechin
s
view
because
the
president
sees
the
pact
with
opec
as
part
of
a
much
bigger
puzzle
involving
dialogue
with
opec
s
leader
saudi
arabia
over
syria
and
other
geopolitical
issues
the
letter
is
a
threat
to
the
deal
extension
but
anyway
putin
is
the
ultimate
decision
maker
one
of
the
sources
said
reuters
has
seen
a
copy
of
the
letter
with
no
date
or
header
a
government
source
said
it
was
sent
at
the
end
of
december
the
deal
has
helped
oil
prices
double
to
more
than
per
barrel
it
has
been
extended
several
times
and
under
the
latest
deal
participants
are
cutting
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
until
the
end
of
june
opec
and
its
allies
will
meet
on
april
in
vienna
to
review
the
pact
should
russia
abandon
the
deal
it
would
result
in
a
steep
oil
price
crash
or
force
saudi
arabia
to
carry
most
of
the
burden
of
cutting
output
to
continue
propping
up
global
crude
prices
riyadh
has
said
it
will
not
do
this
alone
a
price
crash
would
deal
a
severe
blow
to
oil
firms
as
they
operate
fields
where
it
is
more
expensive
to
extract
oil
but
would
benefit
the
broader
economy
the
united
states
which
overtook
russia
and
saudi
arabia
as
the
world
s
biggest
oil
producer
last
year
is
not
participating
in
the
output
cuts
crude
oil
output
is
expected
to
rise
to
a
record
of
more
than
million
bpd
this
year
and
climb
to
nearly
million
bpd
next
year
the
energy
information
administration
said
on
tuesday
sechin
has
been
the
only
russian
official
to
consistently
oppose
the
opec
deal
since
the
kremlin
endorsed
the
plan
saying
it
has
allowed
clout
to
rise
significantly
the
participants
of
the
agreement
have
actually
created
a
preferential
advantage
for
the
usa
that
sees
raising
its
own
market
share
and
the
seizure
of
target
markets
as
its
primary
task
which
has
become
a
strategic
threat
to
russia
s
oil
industry
development
the
letter
seen
by
reuters
says
the
key
strategic
challenge
which
the
domestic
oil
industry
is
faced
with
today
is
the
further
decline
in
russia
s
market
share
despite
the
availability
of
quality
recoverable
oil
reserves
necessary
infrastructure
and
personnel
it
said
rosneft
russia
s
largest
oil
producer
has
been
the
main
contributor
to
the
country
s
share
of
cuts
rosneft
has
signaled
that
its
oil
production
may
increase
by
percent
to
percent
this
year
subject
to
opec
agreements
sechin
who
worked
closely
with
putin
in
the
mayor
s
office
of
petersburg
in
the
has
long
been
skeptical
of
opec
s
ability
to
regulate
oil
markets
and
has
opposed
output
cuts
before
former
saudi
energy
minister
ali
said
in
his
book
out
of
the
desert
that
sechin
told
him
in
a
meeting
with
several
oil
ministers
in
vienna
in
that
russia
was
not
in
a
position
to
cut
production
in
the
book
naimi
wrote
that
he
then
gathered
his
papers
and
said
so
i
think
the
meeting
is
over
the
first
attempts
to
forge
an
output
deal
fell
through
that
year
it
took
another
two
years
of
talks
and
saudi
arabia
replacing
its
oil
minister
to
clinch
a
deal
sechin
s
letter
also
reflects
growing
tension
within
russia
s
government
over
the
oil
production
agreement
the
head
of
russia
s
sovereign
wealth
fund
kirill
dmitriev
one
of
the
main
architects
of
russia
s
agreement
with
opec
told
reuters
in
january
that
he
saw
no
reason
to
abandon
the
pact
despite
a
steep
rise
in
output
dmitriev
said
oil
output
would
decline
only
if
prices
fell
to
per
barrel
but
if
that
happened
it
would
also
cause
major
damage
to
the
russian
economy
which
relies
on
oil
and
gas
exports
for
more
than
half
its
budget
revenues
