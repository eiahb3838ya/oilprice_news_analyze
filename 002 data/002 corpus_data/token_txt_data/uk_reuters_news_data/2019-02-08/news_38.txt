analysis-shell leads cash race but exxon catching up
london
reuters
royal
dutch
shell
widened
its
lead
over
exxon
mobil
as
king
of
cash
among
the
world
s
top
oil
and
gas
companies
last
year
but
its
rival
could
catch
up
with
its
investment
drive
in
new
production
the
five
leading
firms
known
as
oil
majors
more
than
tripled
profits
and
doubled
cash
generation
since
as
deep
cost
cutting
bore
fruit
after
an
industry
slump
unlike
previous
cycles
most
executives
have
promised
in
the
past
week
to
stay
thrifty
with
memories
of
the
oil
price
plunge
below
a
barrel
still
fresh
and
the
outlook
remaining
foggy
for
investors
it
s
been
a
bumpy
ride
in
the
past
five
years
oil
majors
broadly
underperformed
global
stock
markets
a
sharp
drop
in
crude
prices
in
the
last
quarter
of
to
below
a
barrel
from
a
high
of
a
barrel
in
october
was
a
bleak
reminder
of
the
uncertainty
but
stronger
than
expected
results
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
reported
over
the
past
week
gave
the
sector
a
boost
as
companies
surprised
investors
with
their
resilience
to
generate
profit
or
breakeven
at
oil
prices
around
a
barrel
a
barrel
of
benchmark
brent
is
now
trading
around
the
cyclical
driver
is
higher
oil
prices
and
strong
refining
margins
but
underlying
this
is
a
structural
move
to
lower
breakevens
which
is
driving
higher
cash
flows
said
rohan
murphy
energy
equity
analyst
at
allianz
global
investors
i
think
the
companies
will
remain
disciplined
he
said
when
i
meet
the
managements
of
these
companies
they
are
enthused
about
the
future
rather
than
feeling
after
exxon
and
shell
the
other
three
majors
are
firm
chevron
britain
s
bp
and
france
s
total
exxon
is
the
outlier
of
the
group
for
now
as
it
boosts
its
spending
to
develop
projects
in
guyana
and
mozambique
and
its
sprawling
onshore
shale
portfolio
the
company
still
the
biggest
energy
firm
in
terms
of
production
and
market
size
was
slow
to
respond
to
the
drop
in
crude
prices
lagging
rivals
when
they
slashed
costs
sacked
employees
and
sold
assets
in
the
past
three
years
but
under
chief
executive
darren
woods
who
succeeded
rex
tillerson
when
he
became
secretary
of
state
from
until
last
year
exxon
is
undergoing
profound
changes
in
its
operations
and
structure
in
an
effort
to
catch
up
exxon
will
increase
capital
spending
to
billion
this
year
from
billion
in
it
is
also
trying
to
sell
large
assets
in
azerbaijan
and
tanzania
woods
told
analysts
in
a
fourth
quarter
earnings
call
that
the
irving
company
would
accelerate
divestments
exxon
mobil
has
pulled
the
divestiture
value
creation
lever
much
less
than
peers
over
five
and
years
said
doug
terreson
analyst
at
evercore
isi
it
is
timely
for
them
to
divest
and
use
proceeds
to
reinvest
in
higher
quality
exxon
has
pledged
to
double
earnings
and
cash
flow
from
operations
by
shell
is
still
set
to
retain
the
crown
for
cash
generation
until
the
end
of
the
decade
thanks
to
rising
production
and
its
dominance
in
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
but
exxon
s
new
production
should
sharply
narrow
the
gap
according
to
estimates
by
hsbc
which
has
a
hold
rating
on
shell
and
buy
on
exxon
while
exxon
invests
heavily
into
future
production
shell
s
output
growth
is
set
to
slow
after
years
of
gains
following
the
acquisition
of
rival
bg
group
in
for
shell
and
other
rivals
which
have
held
back
on
new
investments
the
race
to
find
new
reserves
to
replace
depleting
fields
will
be
a
key
challenge
said
darren
sissons
portfolio
manager
at

firm
campbell

ross
the

off
of

has
worked
to
strengthen
balance
sheets
with

deterioration
sissons
said
the
next
wave
of
e
p
was
largely
started
tepidly
last
year
by
exxon
and

the
