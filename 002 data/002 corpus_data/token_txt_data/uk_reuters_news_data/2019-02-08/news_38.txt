japanese
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
said
on
monday
that
he
and
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
share
a
responsibility
to
work
towards
global
peace
and
prosperity
with
both
hoping
for
a
prompt
democratic
solution
to
venezuela
s
leadership
crisis
merkel
on
a
visit
to
japan
said
that
germany
recognises
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
as
the
nation
s
interim
president
joining
many
european
nations
and
said
he
should
organise
new
elections
as
soon
as
possible
guaido
is
the
person
with
whom
we
are
talking
and
who
we
expect
to
initiate
an
election
process
as
quickly
as
possible
and
he
is
the
legitimate
interim
president
for
this
task
from
the
german
perspective
and
also
from
the
perspective
of
many
european
partners
merkel
told
a
news
conference
with
abe
and
we
hope
that
this
process
is
as
short
as
possible
and
of
course
peaceful
she
added
abe
emphasized
his
cooperation
with
merkel
during
a
visit
aimed
a
forging
an
alliance
of
multilateralists
to
resist
president
donald
trump
s
america
first
approach
to
trade
and
china
s
pursuit
of
narrow
national
interests
our
responsibility
towards
working
for
global
prosperity
and
security
has
merely
increased
he
said
adding
that
the
two
leaders
would
work
for
a
global
order
based
on
merkel
referred
to
an
trade
deal
that
entered
into
force
on
saying
all
in
all
a
trip
at
a
time
in
which
we
have
demonstrated
that
even
at
times
when
multilateral
agreements
are
in
difficult
straits
we
are
ready
to
conclude
such
good
situations
can
occur
when
all
partners
talk
to
each
other
of
course
fairness
and
reciprocity
are
part
of
this
but
that
is
what
we
abe
did
not
comment
on
guaido
s
status
but
he
said
japan
wanted
a
stable
democratic
and
prompt
solution
to
venezuela
s
political
crisis
several
european
nations
have
joined
the
united
states
in
recognising
guaido
as
interim
president
intensifying
a
global
showdown
over
nicolas
maduro
s
socialist
rule
merkel
said
germany
would
do
everything
possible
to
avoid
a
brexit
but
she
did
not
want
to
see
britain
s
divorce
deal
with
the
eu
the
withdrawal
agreement
renegotiated
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
said
on
sunday
she
would
seek
a
pragmatic
solution
to
a
parliamentary
impasse
over
the
terms
on
which
britain
leaves
the
european
union
when
she
tries
to
reopen
talks
with
brussels
less
than
two
months
before
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
bloc
on
march
there
are
definitely
options
for
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
single
market
even
when
northern
ireland
isn
t
part
of
it
because
it
is
part
of
britain
while
at
the
same
time
meeting
the
desire
to
have
if
possible
no
border
controls
merkel
said
to
solve
this
point
you
have
to
be
creative
and
listen
to
each
other
and
such
discussions
can
and
must
be
conducted
she
added
we
can
still
use
the
time
to
perhaps
reach
an
agreement
if
everyone
shows
