a
piece
of
the
same
campaign
parts
of
which
were
taken
down
last
week
by
facebook

and
alphabet
iuvm
pushes
content
from
iranian
state
media
and
other
outlets
aligned
with
the
government
in

the
iranian
mission
to
the
united
nations
last
week
dismissed
accusations
of
an
iranian
influence
campaign
as
the
extended
network
of
disinformation
highlights
how
multiple
groups
are
exploiting
social
media
to
manipulate
users
and
further
their
geopolitical
agendas
and
how
difficult
it
is
for
tech
companies
to
guard
against
political
interference
on
their
platforms
in
july
a
grand
jury
indicted
russians
whom

campaigns
for

the

network
displayed
the
extent
and
scale
of
the
iranian
operation
it
s
a
amplifier
for
iranian
state
messaging
nimmo
said
this
shows
how
easy
it
is
to
run
an
influence
operation
online
even
when
the
level
of
skill
is
low
the
iranian
operation
relied
on
quantity
not
quality
but
it
stayed
undetected
for
facebook
