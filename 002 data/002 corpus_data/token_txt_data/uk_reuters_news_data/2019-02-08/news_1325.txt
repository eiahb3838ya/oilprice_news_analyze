why uk energy firms are upping prices while government fights to keep them down
london
reuters
an
increase
in
wholesale
energy
prices
pushed
britain
s
centrica
to
announce
its
second
price
rise
of
the
year
this
week
even
as
regulators
prepare
to
cap
prices
to
help
millions
of
households
struggling
with
rising
costs
all
of
britain
s
top
energy
suppliers
have
increased
prices
since
prime
minister
theresa
may
lashed
out
at
what
she
called
energy
prices
last
october
and
pledged
to
cap
prices
in
the
biggest
market
intervention
since
privatisation
almost
years
ago
wholesale
gas
prices
spiked
to
their
highest
level
in
at
least
years
as
the
country
was
hit
by
a
cold
weather
snap
dubbed
the
beast
from
the
east
in
february
while
the
heatwave
felt
across
the
country
this
summer
has
also
led
to
higher
than
usual
demand
for
electricity
academics
said
british
demand
for
electricity
rises
megawatts
mw
for
every
degree
the
temperature
rises
above
degrees
celsius
a
frequent
occurrence
in
recent
weeks
while
lower
wind
speeds
curb
power
output
from
the
country
s
wind
farms
regulator
ofgem
will
cap
prices
on
the
most
widely
used
standard
tariffs
svts
by
the
end
of
the
year
but
experts
warn
prices
could
continue
to
rise
ahead
of
the
cap
if
wholesale
prices
which
make
up
almost
percent
of
a
bill
continue
to
remain
high
we
can
not
of
course
rule
out
further
svt
price
rises
given
the
trajectory
of
commodity
price
changes
analysts
at
bernstein
said
in
a
research
note
reuters
data
shows
average
wholesale
gas
prices
in
the
first
half
of
were
almost
percent
higher
than
over
the
same
period
last
year
while
the
average
electricity
price
was
around
percent
higher
this
is
mostly
due
to
the
global
rise
in
oil
prices
feeding
through
to
wholesale
gas
prices
which
impacts
both
domestic
heating
and
electricity
generation
ofgem
said
this
week
as
it
announced
it
would
allow
suppliers
to
raise
prices
for
the
most
vulnerable
customers
average
benchmark
brent
crude
oil
prices
in
the
first
half
of
were
up
almost
percent
on
a
year
earlier
although
british
energy
users
pay
less
per
unit
for
electricity
and
gas
than
those
in
most
western
european
countries
including
germany
italy
and
spain
according
to
eurostat
data
for
the
second
half
of
ofgem
says
the
cost
of
supplying
britain
s
near
million
homes
has
soared
intervention
in
a
free
market
is
an
unusual
step
for
britain
s
ruling
conservative
party
and
indeed
the
idea
of
capping
prices
was
first
floated
by
the
opposition
labour
party
before
the
parliamentary
election
but
may
made
a
promise
upon
taking
office
in
to
help
poorer
britons
who
are
just
about
managing
many
of
whom
vented
their
frustration
with
years
of
low
earnings
growth
by
voting
for
brexit
two
years
ago
utilities
have
denied
overcharging
but
the
competition
and
markets
authority
found
they
had
overcharged
some
british
households
a
total
of
billion
pounds
a
year
on
average
from
to
the
government
launched
a
campaign
to
persuade
consumers
to
seek
out
the
cheapest
deals
by
switching
tariff
or
supplier
but
the
majority
of
households
remain
on
svts
which
can
be
as
much
as
pounds
a
year
higher
than
other
deals
offered
by
the
same
supplier
all
of
britain
s
big
six
energy
companies
have
announced
price
increases
this
year
the
others
are
sse
edf
energy
innogy
s
npower
and
iberdrola
s
scottish
power
the
closure
last
year
of
rough
britain
s
largest
gas
storage
site
also
means
there
is
less
gas
in
reserve
when
demand
spikes
happen
like
during
last
winter
s
cold
snap
forcing
the
country
to
rely
more
on
imports
a
weaker
pound
makes
imports
of
products
such
as
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
priced
in
dollars
more
expensive
around
percent
of
british
homes
are
heated
by
gas
while
about
percent
of
britain
s
electricity
comes
from
power
plants
so
high
gas
prices
have
a
effect
higher
environmental
levies
such
as
carbon
costs
have
also
lifted
electricity
prices
this
year
britain
s
fossil
fuel
power
generators
are
subject
to
two
carbon
emission
levies
the
european
emission
trading
system
ets
and
the
domestic
carbon
floor
tax
with
cuts
in
the
supply
of
carbon
permits
expected
from
next
year
prices
in
the
ets
have
more
than
doubled
in
to
around
euros
a
tonne
which
must
be
paid
on
top
of
the
domestic
tax
which
is
currently
around
pounds
per
tonne
