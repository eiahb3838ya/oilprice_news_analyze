in

its
day
with
neither

donald
trump
nor
democratic
congressional
leaders
showing
signs
of
bending
on
the

to
try
to
take
some
of
the

democratic
leaders
said
they
did
not
tell
members
to
boycott
trump
s
lunch
but
had
pressed
those
invited
to
consider
whether
the
talks
would
be
merely
a
for
trump
separately
a
bipartisan
group
of
senators
explored
solutions

a

hit
about

was
working
with
the
white
house
and
congress
to
pass
legislation
to
fund
the
coast
guard
while
the
pentagon
is
not

the

is
part
of

department
like
the

be
paid
for
their
service
and

initially
estimated
the
shutdown
would
cost
the
economy
percentage
point
in
growth
every
two
weeks
that
employees
were
without
pay
but
on
tuesday
there
was
an
updated
figure
percentage
point
every
week
because
of
the
impact
of
work
left
undone
by
furloughed
employees
as
well
as
work
left
aside
by
federal
contractors
a
white
