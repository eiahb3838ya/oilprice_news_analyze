israel
still
hopes
the
united
states
will
recognise
its
claim
to
sovereignty
over
the
golan
heights
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
said
on
thursday
after
a
top
official
said
the
issue
was
not
currently
under
consideration
by
washington
israel
captured
much
of
the
golan
from
syria
in
a
war
and
annexed
it
a
move
not
endorsed
internationally
netanyahu
raised
the
possibility
of
recognition
in
his
first
white
house
meeting
with
president
donald
trump
in
february
trump
reversed
a
policy
by
recognising
jerusalem
as
israel
s
capital
in
december
few
other
countries
have
followed
the
move
which
angered
palestinians
who
want
east
jerusalem
as
capital
of
their
own
future
state
last
may
netanyahu
s
intelligence
minister
said
that
recognition
on
the
golan
issue
could
be
forthcoming
within
months
but
in
a
reuters
interview
during
a
visit
to
israel
this
week
trump
s
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
said
there
s
no
discussion
of
it
no
decision
within
the
government
netanyahu
was
asked
by
reporters
whether
israel
in
light
of
bolton
s
remarks
had
dropped
expectations
of
recognition
of
israel
s
golan
claim
he
replied
would
i
give
up
on
such
a
thing
no
in
the
interview
bolton
said
that
while
the
united
states
understands
israel
s
position
regarding
the
golan
there
s
no
change
in
the
position
for
now
once
willing
to
consider
returning
the
golan
for
peace
with
syria
the
israelis
have
argued
in
recent
years
that
the
country
s
civil
war
and
the
presence
of
an
iranian
garrison
backing
damascus
showed
they
had
to
keep
the
strategic
plateau
yoav
gallant
an
israeli
security
cabinet
minister
suggested
on
thursday
that
the
priority
for
israel
and
its
ally
was
the
removal
of
iranian
forces
and
lebanese
hezbollah
guerrillas
from
syria
bolton
discussed
the
matter
with
his
russian
counterpart
in
geneva
on
thursday
moscow
which
backs
damascus
wants
syrian
territorial
integrity
restored
as
syria
is
rebuilt
we
have
two
significant
interests
the
first
is
iran
and
hezbollah
each
going
back
where
they
belong
gallant
told
israel
s
channel
television
and
the
second
interest
is
unequivocal
israeli
sovereignty
on
every
metre
of
the
golan
i
think
that
if
we
work
the
right
way
we
will
get
russia
has
said
that
it
can
not
compel
iran
to
quit
syria
bolton
in
his
reuters
interview
said
russia
was
stuck
in
syria
and
seeking
alternative
sources
of
reconstruction
funds
this
gave
washington
leverage
in
urging
an
iranian
withdrawal
the
prerequisite
for
resolving
the
syria
crisis
bolton
said
moscow
disputed
those
remarks
