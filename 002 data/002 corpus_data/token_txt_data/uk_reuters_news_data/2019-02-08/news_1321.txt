washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
intensified
his
spat
with
turkey
on
friday
by
imposing
higher
tariffs
on
metal
imports
putting
unprecedented
economic
pressure
on
a
nato
ally
and
deepening
turmoil
in
turkish
financial
markets
criticizing
the
state
of
the
relationship
with
ankara
trump
announced
on
twitter
that
he
had
authorized
a
doubling
of
duties
on
aluminium
and
steel
imported
from
turkey
making
them
percent
and
percent
respectively
the
white
house
said
trump
would
use
a
section
of
law
that
allows
for
tariffs
on
national
security
grounds
to
impose
the
increased
duties
washington
and
ankara
have
been
at
odds
for
months
over
an
american
pastor
detained
in
turkey
the
syrian
civil
war
and
other
diplomatic
issues
trump
s
move
sent
turkey
s
lira
currency
deeper
into
tailspin
the
lira
which
has
long
been
falling
on
worries
about
the
government
s
influence
over
monetary
policy
and
the
tensions
plunged
more
than
percent
at
one
point
on
friday
to
a
record
low
against
the
dollar
even
before
trump
s
announcement
president
tayyip
erdogan
told
turks
to
exchange
gold
and
dollars
for
lira
in
order
to
fight
an
economic
waves
from
the
crisis
spread
abroad
with
investors
selling
off
shares
in
european
banks
with
large
exposure
to
the
turkish
economy
i
have
just
authorized
a
doubling
of
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminum
with
respect
to
turkey
as
their
currency
the
turkish
lira
slides
rapidly
downward
against
our
very
strong
dollar
trump
said
in
an
early
morning
post
on
twitter
aluminum
will
now
be
percent
and
steel
percent
our
relations
with
turkey
are
not
good
at
this
time
the
united
states
the
world
s
biggest
steel
importer
imposed
tariffs
of
percent
on
aluminium
and
percent
on
steel
in
march
for
imports
from
a
variety
of
countries
turkey
is
the
steel
exporter
to
the
united
states
ankara
sent
a
delegation
this
week
to
washington
to
meet
with
both
the
state
and
treasury
departments
to
resolve
some
of
the
disputes
but
those
talks
showed
no
signs
of
breakthrough
last
week
the
united
states
imposed
sanctions
on
turkey
s
justice
minister
and
interior
minister
for
not
releasing
pastor
andrew
brunson
brunson
an
evangelical
presbyterian
pastor
from
north
carolina
was
jailed
for
allegedly
supporting
a
group
that
ankara
blames
for
an
attempted
coup
in
brunson
denies
the
charge
his
cause
resonates
with
christian
conservative
supporters
of
trump
who
could
also
be
influential
as
republicans
seek
to
retain
control
of
congress
in
midterm
elections
in
november
trump
and
turkey
s
erdogan
have
had
an
relationship
at
the
general
assembly
last
year
trump
called
erdogan
a
friend
who
got
very
high
marks
for
how
he
runs
the
country
just
weeks
ago
trump
was
reported
to
have
erdogan
during
a
nato
meeting
in
brussels
aaron
stein
senior
fellow
at
the
atlantic
council
think
tank
in
washington
said
trump
has
personalized
the
brunson
issue
and
feels
like
erdogan
cheated
we
are
in
uncharted
waters
here
no
idea
how
this
ends
or
where
ankara
wants
to
take
this
but
it
s
going
to
be
a
wild
ride
stein
said
in
addition
to
the
brunson
case
washington
is
seeking
the
release
of
three
locally
employed
embassy
staff
trade
issues
and
differences
over
syria
have
also
strained
bilateral
ties
turkey
also
wants
the
united
states
to
extradite
fethullah
gulen
a
muslim
cleric
who
turkish
authorities
say
masterminded
the
coup
attempt
against
erdogan
in
which
people
were
killed
gulen
denies
the
allegation
turkey
home
to
the
incirlik
air
base
which
is
used
by
forces
in
the
middle
east
has
been
a
nato
member
since
the
and
a
close
ally
of
the
united
states
