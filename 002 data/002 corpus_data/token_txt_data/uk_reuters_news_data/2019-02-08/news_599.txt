brexit minister raab quits uk government over may's eu deal
london
reuters
britain
s
brexit
minister
dominic
raab
resigned
on
thursday
in
protest
at
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
deal
for
leaving
the
european
union
here
is
the
text
of
the
resignation
statement
it
has
been
an
honour
to
serve
in
your
government
as
justice
minister
housing
minister
and
brexit
secretary
i
regret
to
say
that
following
the
cabinet
meeting
yesterday
on
the
brexit
deal
i
must
resign
i
understand
why
you
have
chosen
to
pursue
the
deal
with
the
eu
on
the
terms
proposed
and
i
respect
the
different
views
held
in
good
faith
by
all
of
our
colleagues
for
my
part
i
can
not
support
the
proposed
deal
for
two
reasons
first
i
believe
that
the
regulatory
regime
proposed
for
northern
ireland
presents
a
very
real
threat
to
the
integrity
of
the
united
kingdom
second
i
can
not
support
an
indefinite
backstop
arrangement
where
the
eu
holds
a
veto
over
our
ability
to
exit
the
terms
of
the
backstop
amount
to
a
hybrid
of
the
eu
customs
union
and
single
market
obligations
no
democratic
nation
ever
signed
up
to
be
bound
by
such
an
extensive
regime
imposed
externally
without
any
democratic
control
over
the
laws
to
be
applied
nor
the
ability
to
decide
to
exit
the
arrangement
that
arrangement
is
now
also
taken
as
the
starting
point
for
negotiating
the
future
economic
partnership
if
we
accept
that
it
will
severely
prejudice
the
second
phase
of
negotiations
against
the
uk
above
all
i
can
not
reconcile
the
terms
of
the
proposed
deal
with
the
promises
we
made
to
the
country
in
our
manifesto
at
the
last
election
this
is
at
its
heart
a
matter
of
public
trust
i
appreciate
that
you
disagree
with
my
judgment
on
these
issues
i
have
weighed
very
carefully
the
alternative
courses
of
action
which
the
government
could
take
on
which
i
have
previously
advised
ultimately
you
deserve
a
brexit
secretary
who
can
make
the
case
for
the
deal
you
are
pursuing
with
conviction
i
am
only
sorry
in
good
conscience
that
i
can
not
my
respect
for
you
and
the
fortitude
you
have
shown
in
difficult
times
remains
undimmed
