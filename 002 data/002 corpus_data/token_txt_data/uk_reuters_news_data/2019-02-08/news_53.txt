central

risk
kidnapping
or
death
under
a
new
plan
to
deport
them
to
murderous
and
mexican
border
cities
while
their
asylum
cases
are
processed
the
city
of
reynosa
and
a
nearby
stretch
of
the
rio
grande
that
divides
texas
from
the
mexican
state
of
tamaulipas
is
by
far
the
busiest
crossing
point
along
the
northern
mexican
border
for
migrants
seeking
asylum
in
the
united
states
but
reynosa
is
a
wasteland
of
vandalised
and
abandoned
homes
in
a
state
that
is
a
key
battlefield
in
mexico
s
bloody
drug
wars
with
cartel
factions

civilians
are
often
caught
in
the
crossfire
on
tuesday
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
launched
a
plan
to
return
central
american
to
mexico
rather
than
have
them
wait
in
the
united
states
dubbed
the
migration
protection
protocols
the
first
return
of
an
took
place
in
mexico
s
west
coast
city
of
tijuana
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
border
from
reynosa
authorities
plan
to
gradually
widen
the
program
to
other
legal
ports
of
entry
including
tamaulipas
according
to
the
department
of
homeland
security
dhs
we
re
returning
them
to
where
they
came
in
said
dhs
spokeswoman
katie
waldman
last
year
people
asked
for
asylum
in
the
rio
grande
valley
sector
that
skirts
the
river
in
southern
texas
after
being
caught
by
border
agents
on
river
banks
and
in
fields
or
after
walking
up
to
ports
of
entry
more
than
half
the
cases
for
the
entire
border
asked
to
comment
on
the
risks
of
returning
migrants
to
a
country
afflicted
with
disappearances
and
violent
crime
waldman
said
that
s
no
more
dangerous
than
some
of
these
violent
parts
of
the
united
states
like
in
fbi
data
indicates
that
chicago
one
of
the
most
violent
cities
in
the
united
states
had
a
homicide
rate
of
about
murders
per
residents
similar
to
the
level
in
tamaulipas
cited
by
the
interior
ministry
in
mexico
however
around
percent
of
crimes
went
unreported
last
year
the
national
statistics
office
estimated
while
the
data
does
not
include
unresolved
disappearances
reckoned
by
geovanni
barrios
president
of
justicia
tamaulipas
at
over
in
tamaulipas
alone
the
border
zone
has
become
a
central
theatre
of
conflict
since
the
mexican
government
launched
a
militarised
effort
against
the
cartels
in
and
they
began
fragmenting
according
to
information
from
the
defence
ministry
soldiers
have
since
died
in
tamaulipas
more
than
in
any
other
mexican
state
now
splinter
groups
of
the
gulf
and
zeta
drug
cartels
fight
pitched
battles
for
territory
in
armoured
vehicles
emblazoned
with
their
emblems
hundreds
of
unidentified
bodies
lie
in
unmarked
graves
the
state
department
has
a
level
do
not
travel
warning
for
five
mexican
states
including
tamaulipas
more
frequently
levelled
in
active
war
zones
the
project
of
securely
hosting
central
americans
while
immigration
judges
adjudicate
their
cases
seems
a
pipe
dream
according
to
reynosa
s
mayor
maki
ortiz
we
don
t
have
the
capacity
we
don
t
have
the
resources
the
infrastructure
or
the
budget
for
them
ortiz
said
adding
that
no
one
had
earmarked
the
extra
funds
for
a
city
that
barely
has
the
means
to
combat
its
criminals
unlike
recent
caravans
of
migrants
that
headed
for
tijuana
often
several
hundred
people
strong
most
of
those
who
journey
to
reynosa
make
their
way
alone
or
aided
by
clandestine
people
smugglers
dependent
on
those
smugglers
to
guide
them
for
a
steep
fee
over
the
rio
grande
with
the
assent
of
cartel
factions
that
control
parts
of
the
riverbank
they
wait
nervously
in
safe
houses
for
their
appointed
crossing
hour
or
they
ponder
their
options
in
the
senda
de
vida
shelter
the
only
one
to
accept
central
americans
in
a
district
dominated
by
the
gulf
cartel
who
are
blamed
for
multiple
kidnappings
and
disappearances
migrants
at
the
shelter
are
warned
not
to
venture
out
alone
i
ve
never
even
seen
the
city
since
i
arrived
at
the
bus
terminal
said
maria
alfaro
a
honduran
cook
staying
in
the
shelter
too
old
to
find
work
in
a
factory
in
honduras
she
came
to
mexico
hoping
for
job
she
said
a
salvadoran
she
befriended
in
a
migrant
shelter
in
the
southern
mexican
town
of
tapachula
turned
out
to
be
a
member
of
the
zeta
cartel
she
said
an
assertion
supported
by
a
local
press
clipping
seen
by
reuters
when
she
tried
to
escape
him
he
sent
associates
to
kidnap
her
from
a
bus
station
and
hauled
her
to
a
house
where
the
gang
members
made
her
their
sex
slave
she
said
her
voice
breaking
weeks
later
she
escaped
but
she
said
she
feared
the
gang
s
criminal
ties
in
honduras
would
put
her
at
risk
of
being
hunted
down
if
she
went
home
so
she
went
north
planning
to
ask
for
asylum
in
the
united
states
the
united
states
takes
better
care
of
people
doesn
t
it
she
said
keeping
accurate
figures
for
the
central
americans
who
go
missing
is
difficult
because
migrants
are
in
transit
often
illegally
and
anyone
accompanying
them
is
unlikely
to
notify
authorities
said
barrios
of
justicia
tamaulipas
pastor
hector
silva
founder
of
senda
de
vida
said
numerous
central
americans
in
his
shelter
had
disappeared
after
venturing
out
against
his
advice
the
most
recent
case
a
few
weeks
earlier
each
time
silva
said
his
visitors
left
their
few
possessions
as
if
they
meant
to
return
within
minutes
sometimes
families
or
friends
found
the
missing
migrants
and
paid
a
ransom
before
it
was
too
late
he
said
in
the
shadow
of
the
international
bridge
with
a
flag
fluttering
just
over
the
river
a
cross
carved
with
the
words
memoria
migrantes
stands
as
a
bleak
memorial
to
those
who
were
never
heard
from
again
