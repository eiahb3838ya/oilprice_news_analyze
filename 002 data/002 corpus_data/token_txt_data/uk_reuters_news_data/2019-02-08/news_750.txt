uk budget and bank of england take back seat to brexit drama
london
reuters
britain
s
budget
announcement
on
monday
and
a
super
thursday
at
the
bank
of
england
would
normally
be
key
moments
for
the
world
s
economy
but
this
time
they
are
likely
to
be
overshadowed
by
the
drama
of
brexit
finance
minister
philip
hammond
and
bank
of
england
governor
mark
carney
have
little
option
but
to
sit
on
the
fence
as
they
wait
to
see
whether
a
exit
from
the
european
union
which
they
warn
would
harm
the
economy
can
be
averted
both
men
have
other
business
they
want
to
get
on
with
hammond
is
under
pressure
from
prime
minister
theresa
may
to
end
a
decade
of
austerity
to
see
off
a
rise
in
popularity
of
the
opposition
labour
party
at
the
boe
where
an
interest
rate
decision
and
economic
forecasts
are
due
to
be
announced
on
thursday
carney
and
his
fellow
policymakers
want
to
progress
with
their
plan
to
raise
borrowing
costs
gradually
over
the
coming
years
that
would
allow
the
british
central
bank
to
follow
the
lead
of
other
central
banks
especially
in
the
united
states
and
canada
which
are
dismantling
years
of
massive
stimulus
expectations
of
another
rate
hike
by
the
federal
reserve
in
december
are
likely
to
grow
if
the
monthly
payrolls
report
on
shows
further
jobs
growth
and
rising
pay
in
the
euro
zone
data
on
economic
growth
and
inflation
on
tuesday
and
wednesday
will
show
whether
the
recovery
in
the
single
currency
area
has
kept
pace
but
in
britain
with
brexit
just
five
months
away
things
are
much
less
clear
cut
there
is
no
sign
of
a
brexit
breakthrough
with
brussels
in
large
part
because
may
s
conservative
party
is
riven
over
how
close
britain
should
remain
to
the
european
union
after
it
leaves
the
bloc
the
budget
is
likely
to
be
something
of
a
holding
exercise
until
the
brexit
fog
clears
and
the
mpc
is
likely
to
remain
in
a
state
of
inertia
until
there
is
a
bit
more
clarity
on
the
state
of
the
brexit
negotiations
ruth
gregory
an
economist
with
capital
economics
a
research
firm
said
when
he
stands
up
in
parliament
on
monday
afternoon
hammond
is
expected
to
use
his
budget
speech
to
try
to
cool
the
conservative
rebels
by
dangling
the
prospect
of
higher
spending
in
the
future
as
long
as
a
brexit
deal
is
done
britain
s
economy
has
slowed
since
the
referendum
decision
to
leave
the
eu
but
it
has
not
suffered
as
badly
as
many
forecasters
expected
giving
hammond
some
fiscal
wiggle
room
to
fund
higher
health
spending
already
promised
by
may
hammond
might
get
further
help
if
britain
s
budget
forecasters
scale
back
their
estimates
of
future
deficits
as
they
have
suggested
they
will
but
his
ability
to
ramp
up
spending
in
other
areas
depends
most
on
avoiding
a
new
shock
to
the
economy
a
brexit
would
slash
economic
growth
to
just
percent
a
year
in
and
compared
with
and
percent
if
there
is
a
deal
the
national
institute
of
economic
and
social
research
estimated
on
friday
britain
s
budget
deficit
would
stop
falling
and
would
rise
under
a
scenario
according
to
its
forecasts
looking
further
ahead
hammond
has
suggested
he
will
need
to
raise
taxes
to
help
fund
higher
public
spending
but
the
prospect
of
getting
controversial
measures
passed
in
parliament
where
the
conservatives
have
no
outright
majority
is
probably
too
daunting
at
a
time
of
heightened
brexit
tensions
for
the
boe
the
brexit
stakes
are
high
too
it
has
begun
raising
interest
rates
from
their
levels
and
its
chief
economist
has
said
he
sees
signs
of
a
new
dawn
for
british
workers
pay
long
the
missing
link
in
the
country
s
recovery
from
the
financial
crisis
but
most
economists
think
it
will
wait
until
may
to
raise
rates
again
assuming
britain
leaves
the
eu
with
a
deal
in
any
other
situation
we
suspect
the
bank
of
england
would
be
looking
to
increase
interest
rates
pretty
soon
ing
economists
said
in
a
note
to
clients
on
friday
but
inevitably
brexit
remains
policymakers
number
one
consideration
and
given
that
there
may
still
be
some
time
before
we
know
for
sure
whether
a
deal
will
be
in
place
before
the
uk
formally
leaves
the
eu
there
is
a
risk
growth
slows
as
businesses
and
consumers
grow
