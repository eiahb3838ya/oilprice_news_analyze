next boosted by hot summer but stays cool on outlook
london
reuters
next
got
a
boost
from
britain
s
hot
summer
with
a
percent
rise
in
sales
but
the
fashion
retailer
does
not
see
the
warm
glow
lasting
sticking
to
forecasts
that
indicate
little
growth
for
the
rest
of
the
year
we
in
the
second
quarter
as
a
result
of
the
weather
we
think
some
of
that
will
be
sales
pulled
forward
form
august
chief
executive
simon
wolfson
said
on
wednesday
some
of
the
stock
we
were
planning
to
sell
in
august
has
already
he
said
the
warm
weather
had
been
good
for
summer
fashion
but
that
was
not
a
reason
in
itself
to
change
its
outlook
shares
in
next
which
has
been
a
standout
performer
among
struggling
british
retailers
largely
due
to
the
success
of
its
online
range
fell
percent
in
early
trading
hargreaves
lansdown
analyst
george
salmon
said
hopes
had
been
high
that
the
sunny
weather
would
have
led
to
higher
profit
expectations
but
next
said
it
would
rather
wait
and
see
how
the
remainder
of
the
summer
goes
this
seems
fair
enough
but
it
will
have
left
a
few
wondering
if
the
best
summer
in
years
isn
t
enough
to
upgrade
profits
then
want
is
he
said
next
s
positive
performance
followed
a
strong
first
quarter
for
the
fashion
and
homewares
retailer
against
an
easy
comparative
which
led
it
to
upgrade
forecasts
in
may
it
expects
sales
to
grow
by
percent
for
the
year
to
january
and
group
profit
before
tax
to
dip
slightly
to
million
pounds
at
the
centre
of
its
guidance
wolfson
said
the
percent
rise
in
sales
implied
there
would
be
little
growth
in
rest
of
the
year
the
second
half
is
slightly
bigger
so
sales
will
be
slightly
up
but
not
dramatically
he
said
in
an
interview
growth
continued
to
be
driven
by
next
s
online
operation
with
sales
up
percent
in
the
weeks
to
july
sales
in
its
retail
stores
fell
percent
in
the
quarter
an
acceleration
of
the
percent
decline
seen
in
the
first
quarter
wolfson
said
the
online
operation
had
suffered
growing
pains
in
our
online
warehouses
we
are
beginning
to
get
close
to
capacity
and
as
warehouses
get
close
to
capacity
they
become
crowded
and
a
little
bit
less
efficient
he
said
we
are
investing
in
new
capacity
so
we
don
t
expect
there
will
be
a
crunch
but
it
does
mean
in
the
first
half
there
has
been
some
operating
the
higher
warehouse
costs
would
largely
offset
a
million
pound
boost
to
profit
from
a
successful
clearance
