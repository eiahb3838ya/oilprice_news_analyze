softly, softly for now, may's enforcers gear up for big brexit vote
london
reuters
less
than
five
months
before
britain
leaves
the
european
union
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
parliamentary
enforcers
are
on
the
prowl
for
now
the
government
whips
whose
job
it
is
to
ensure
parliament
backs
whatever
brexit
deal
may
agrees
with
brussels
are
taking
a
approach
but
chief
whip
julian
smith
and
his
team
have
a
powerful
armoury
at
their
disposal
to
force
politicians
into
line
with
an
agreement
most
likely
to
go
before
lawmakers
later
this
year
may
s
team
and
the
whips
she
appointed
are
quietly
sounding
out
who
might
vote
against
it
several
politicians
told
reuters
lacking
a
parliamentary
majority
may
is
hostage
not
only
to
her
bitterly
divided
conservative
party
over
brexit
but
also
to
the
northern
irish
party
that
props
up
her
government
it
was
never
going
to
be
easy
but
is
looking
even
more
difficult
after
the
resignation
on
friday
of
jo
johnson
a
transport
minister
and
brother
to
leading
brexit
campaigner
boris
johnson
there
are
also
suggestions
that
others
in
government
may
follow
and
that
there
could
be
a
rebellion
by
the
democratic
unionist
party
so
far
the
whips
tactics
show
no
sign
of
success
to
persuade
them
to
support
the
government
some
eurosceptic
conservatives
have
been
wined
and
dined
including
at
may
s
downing
street
office
others
including
some
members
of
the
opposition
labour
party
have
been
invited
to
private
meetings
at
which
they
have
been
asked
their
opinions
and
subjected
to
painstaking
explanations
of
the
prime
minister
s
position
i
am
not
going
to
change
my
mind
no
matter
how
nice
a
dinner
might
be
said
one
conservative
lawmaker
on
condition
of
anonymity
explaining
that
he
had
refused
three
invitations
to
downing
street
for
such
a
meal
clearly
they
are
trying
to
pick
off
people
who
they
think
might
be
malleable
but
frankly
first
of
all
before
they
get
to
that
point
they
should
be
able
to
explain
what
the
government
is
going
to
do
and
at
the
moment
no
one
has
a
government
and
opposition
parties
each
have
their
own
whips
a
term
with
its
roots
in
that
dates
back
to
and
refers
to
the
whipping
of
lawmakers
to
get
them
to
attend
votes
and
support
the
party
line
they
also
act
as
tellers
for
parliamentary
votes
and
manage
the
pairing
system
with
rival
parties
that
ensures
genuine
absences
do
not
skew
votes
in
parliament
smith
outraged
lawmakers
in
july
when
he
told
some
conservatives
to
break
a
pairing
arrangement
in
what
may
said
was
an
honest
mistake
one
then
voted
with
the
government
at
a
key
brexit
vote
even
though
his
liberal
democrat
pair
was
away
as
she
had
just
given
birth
tactics
used
by
whips
in
the
past
are
the
stuff
of
parliamentary
legend
a
series
of
votes
on
the
maastricht
treaty
on
deeper
eu
integration
in
the
early
brought
reports
of
blackmail
threats
to
expose
lawmakers
indiscretions
and
even
physical
manhandling
to
win
support
one
former
conservative
chief
whip
gavin
williamson
kept
a
pet
tarantula
on
his
desk
named
cronus
after
the
greek
god
who
ate
his
own
children
he
once
said
that
while
he
preferred
the
carrot
to
the
stick
it
is
amazing
what
can
be
achieved
with
a
sharpened
carrot
such
practices
have
inspired
television
shows
such
as
the
british
and
versions
of
house
of
cards
but
for
many
in
parliament
now
such
behaviour
bears
little
resemblance
to
the
reality
of
everyday
political
life
the
strongest
coercion
so
far
over
the
brexit
vote
lawmakers
say
has
been
the
promise
of
budget
sweeteners
to
curry
favour
they
can
make
your
life
difficult
said
one
lawmaker
recounting
how
the
whips
once
refused
him
permission
to
be
absent
from
parliament
for
a
family
celebration
because
he
would
have
missed
a
vote
the
whips
can
also
threaten
to
put
wavering
lawmakers
on
boring
procedural
committees
or
block
any
career
promotion
another
member
of
parliament
said
defying
a
strict
whip
can
lead
to
a
lawmaker
s
temporary
expulsion
from
their
party
in
parliament
the
whips
themselves
must
support
the
party
line
or
quit
may
has
promised
to
give
parliament
a
say
over
brexit
britain
s
biggest
foreign
and
trade
policy
shift
in
decades
if
lawmakers
vote
down
the
deal
she
agrees
britain
could
leave
the
eu
without
clarity
on
the
terms
of
its
departure
causing
uncertainty
for
businesses
and
trade
and
making
a
challenge
to
may
s
leadership
or
an
early
election
more
likely
may
says
the
agreement
with
brussels
is
percent
complete
although
how
to
prevent
a
return
to
a
hard
border
between
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
and
eu
member
ireland
remains
a
sticking
point
in
talks
and
within
her
cabinet
and
while
even
winning
the
backing
of
her
top
ministers
for
any
deal
is
a
struggle
her
main
challenge
will
be
securing
the
support
of
parliament
where
divisions
opened
by
britain
s
referendum
to
leave
the
eu
have
become
deeply
entrenched
in
the
lower
chamber
may
has
a
working
majority
of
only
with
the
support
of
northern
ireland
s
dup
their
confidence
and
supply
deal
was
negotiated
by
the
two
parties
whips
after
a
june
election
produced
a
hung
parliament
more
than
conservative
lawmakers
have
said
they
reject
may
s
chequers
plan
and
at
the
weekend
dup
leader
arlene
foster
said
her
party
could
not
support
her
proposals
as
they
now
stand
the
prime
minister
may
have
to
break
with
tradition
and
rely
on
support
from
the
labour
party
with
the
ink
drying
on
a
deal
as
one
eurosceptic
lawmaker
described
it
minds
are
increasingly
focussed
i
couldn
t
support
the
chequers
proposals
and
they
have
been
further
diluted
through
negotiations
with
the
european
union
so
i
will
not
be
able
to
vote
for
the
final
deal
said
andrew
bridgen
a
conservative
lawmaker
and
brexit
supporter
he
told
reuters
the
deal
that
is
taking
shape
would
not
allow
britain
to
do
full
trade
deals
including
goods
and
failed
to
hand
back
power
to
parliament
from
unelected
eurocrats
the
whips
whose
work
is
largely
behind
the
scenes
and
who
do
not
give
interviews
will
need
to
crush
similar
dissent
to
get
the
vote
passed
for
now
they
are
not
indicating
how
they
will
do
this
asked
whether
he
would
change
his
mind
if
the
whips
applied
pressure
bridgen
said
i
don
t
think
the
whips
will
bother
trying
to
turn
nasty
on
me
they
know
from
experience
that
it
won
t
but
other
lawmakers
say
the
heat
will
only
be
turned
up
when
a
deal
is
done
i
think
their
conversations
with
colleagues
are
a
bit
premature
anyway
said
one
but
once
we
do
know
what
the
government
is
going
to
do
by
and
large
people
will
have
pretty
fixed
