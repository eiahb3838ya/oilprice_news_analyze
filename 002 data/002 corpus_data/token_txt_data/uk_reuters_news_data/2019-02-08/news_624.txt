president
tayyip
erdogan
said
recordings
related
to
the
killing
of
jamal
khashoggi
which
turkey
has
shared
with
western
allies
are
appalling
and
shocked
a
saudi
intelligence
officer
who
listened
to
them
turkish
media
reported
on
tuesday
khashoggi
a
critic
of
de
facto
saudi
ruler
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
was
killed
in
saudi
arabia
s
istanbul
consulate
on
in
a
hit
which
erdogan
says
was
ordered
at
the
highest
levels
of
the
saudi
government
six
weeks
after
khashoggi
s
death
turkey
is
trying
to
keep
up
pressure
on
prince
mohammed
and
has
released
a
stream
of
evidence
that
undermined
riyadh
s
early
denials
of
involvement
prince
mohammed
won
support
on
tuesday
from
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
who
said
he
did
not
think
recordings
of
the
killing
shared
by
turkey
implicated
the
young
crown
prince
erdogan
told
reporters
on
his
plane
returning
from
a
weekend
visit
to
france
that
he
discussed
the
saudi
journalist
s
killing
with
the
french
and
german
leaders
there
adding
that
turkey
had
played
the
recording
to
at
least
six
countries
the
recordings
are
really
appalling
indeed
when
the
saudi
intelligence
officer
listened
to
the
recordings
he
was
so
shocked
he
said
this
one
must
have
taken
heroin
only
someone
who
takes
heroin
would
do
this
he
added
khashoggi
s
murder
has
provoked
global
outrage
but
little
concrete
action
by
major
powers
against
saudi
arabia
the
world
s
largest
oil
exporter
and
a
strong
proponent
of
policy
to
contain
iranian
influence
across
the
middle
east
president
donald
trump
has
expressed
reluctance
to
punish
saudi
arabia
economically
citing
its
purchases
of
military
equipment
and
investments
in
firms
bolton
said
he
did
not
think
that
people
who
heard
the
recordings
concluded
that
the
crown
prince
was
linked
to
the
killing
and
certainly
that
is
not
the
position
of
the
saudi
government
he
said
in
singapore
asked
again
if
the
audio
tape
provided
by
turkey
did
not
link
prince
mohammed
to
the
killing
in
any
way
bolton
said
i
haven
t
listened
to
the
tape
myself
but
in
the
assessment
of
those
who
have
listened
to
it
that
is
bolton
shares
with
saudi
arabia
a
hawkish
stance
against
riyadh
s
biggest
middle
east
rival
iran
and
he
championed
washington
s
resumption
of
sanctions
on
the
islamic
republic
the
new
york
times
in
a
report
confirmed
by
a
turkish
official
said
a
member
of
the
saudi
team
which
was
sent
to
istanbul
to
kill
khashoggi
told
one
of
his
superiors
after
the
killing
to
tell
your
boss
which
the
newspaper
said
was
believed
to
be
a
reference
to
prince
mohammed
the
individual
was
identified
as
maher
mutreb
who
reports
to
an
aide
to
the
crown
prince
saud
mutreb
was
also
quoted
as
saying
words
to
the
effect
that
the
deed
was
done
in
his
comments
to
reporters
erdogan
said
it
was
clear
the
killing
was
planned
and
that
the
order
came
from
the
top
level
of
saudi
authorities
but
that
he
could
not
think
such
a
thing
of
king
salman
for
whom
he
has
limitless
respect
the
crown
prince
says
i
will
clarify
the
matter
i
will
do
what
is
necessary
we
are
waiting
patiently
erdogan
said
adding
that
the
perpetrators
of
the
killing
were
among
suspects
detained
in
saudi
arabia
it
must
be
revealed
who
gave
them
the
order
to
last
month
two
separate
intelligence
sources
told
reuters
that
qahtani
gave
orders
over
skype
to
khashoggi
s
killers
at
the
consulate
more
recently
a
government
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
qahtani
featured
prominently
throughout
the
recordings
saudi
state
media
said
king
salman
sacked
him
and
other
officials
over
the
killing
and
a
senior
saudi
official
said
last
month
that
qahtani
had
been
detained
but
four
sources
based
in
the
gulf
told
reuters
this
week
that
he
was
still
at
liberty
and
continued
to
operate
discreetly
he
still
has
the
same
influence
one
of
the
sources
said
qahtani
has
wielded
that
influence
over
the
last
three
years
with
his
authority
growing
alongside
that
of
the
young
prince
he
ran
social
media
for
prince
mohammed
masterminded
the
arrest
of
hundreds
of
saudi
arabia
s
elite
late
last
year
in
a
campaign
riyadh
said
aimed
at
rooting
out
corruption
and
took
a
harsh
line
against
neighbouring
qatar
when
saudi
arabia
imposed
an
economic
boycott
of
the
gulf
state
in
june
he
also
supervised
the
