reuters
france
s
yellow
vest
demonstrators
kept
numerous
roads
across
the
country
blocked
on
saturday
as
groups
of
protesters
marched
in
city
centres
but
the
backlash
was
more
dispersed
and
muted
than
in
previous
weeks
driven
by
anger
over
a
perceived
squeeze
on
household
income
the
movement
has
shaken
emmanuel
macron
s
presidency
and
hurt
retailers
and
other
businesses
after
the
spontaneous
protest
against
fuel
taxes
gave
way
to
riots
in
early
december
sporadic
clashes
with
police
broke
out
as
protesters
in
several
cities
including
bordeaux
and
nantes
were
pushed
back
by
teargas
and
stun
grenades
though
the
turnout
across
france
dwindled
on
the
seventh
saturday
of
demonstrations
official
estimates
were
not
yet
available
though
french
tv
channel
lci
citing
unnamed
sources
put
the
turnout
at
well
below
the
nearly
last
week
in
paris
where
protests
turned
violent
in
early
december
police
said
by
early
evening
that
they
had
detained
some
people
after
demonstrators
took
to
the
streets
down
from
at
least
arrests
last
week
with
a
similar
number
of
protesters
people
wearing
vests
mingled
among
shoppers
and
tourists
and
chanted
macron
resign
on
the
champs
elysees
avenue
home
to
boutiques
that
were
smashed
and
bore
the
brunt
of
lootings
at
the
height
of
the
violence
major
stores
including
some
that
were
boarded
up
on
recent
weekends
opened
their
doors
other
demonstrators
converged
west
of
the
capital
near
the
headquarters
of
news
channel
bfm
tv
where
scuffles
ensued
and
several
cars
were
set
on
fire
outside
the
offices
of
the
parisien
newspaper
in
the
evening
though
it
was
initially
unclear
who
had
torched
them
and
whether
it
was
directly
linked
to
the
protests
in
toulouse
where
like
in
bordeaux
crowds
exceeded
people
protesters
set
bins
on
fire
and
some
hurled
yellow
paint
at
police
several
highway
tolls
and
motorway
across
france
were
blocked
operator
vinci
said
and
traffic
on
some
of
the
roads
leading
to
spain
was
severely
backed
up
the
protests
months
into
macron
s
tenure
and
his
bid
to
reshape
the
economy
are
expected
to
rumble
on
into
january
despite
his
attempts
to
defuse
them
including
by
backtracking
on
planned
fuel
tax
hikes
and
signalling
wage
rises
for
the
poorest
workers
we
will
continue
until
we
win
until
macron
backs
down
and
gives
us
what
we
deserve
more
purchasing
power
less
taxes
a
healthy
life
without
having
to
tighten
and
tighten
and
tighten
the
belt
at
the
end
of
every
single
month
a
protester
in
nantes
who
only
gave
her
name
as
virginie
told
reuters
my
son
asks
me
for
something
and
i
say
no
i
can
t
but
i
work
so
it
is
not
stemming
in
part
from
a
feeling
of
disconnect
between
more
provincial
and
rural
areas
and
an
urban
elite
macron
has
come
to
represent
for
his
critics
the
protest
has
spawned
at
roundabouts
and
roadsides
as
people
dig
their
heels
in
demanding
more
measures
to
help
household
incomes
the
yellow
vest
protests
named
after
the
garments
that
drivers
have
to
carry
in
their
cars
in
case
of
emergency
have
been
concentrated
on
saturdays
after
first
erupting
on
following
a
campaign
spread
on
social
media
but
protesters
were
also
being
urged
to
turn
out
on
including
for
a
show
of
force
on
the
champs
elysee
where
revellers
tend
to
gather
for
new
year
s
celebrations
and
a
firework
display
the
city
council
has
said
festivities
usually
boxed
in
by
a
heavy
police
presence
would
go
ahead
as
planned

is
expected
to
address
voters
