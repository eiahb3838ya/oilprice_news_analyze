brexit betrayal would hurt uk more than leaving - hammond
london

a
brexit
outcome
that
left
a
large
segment
of
the
british
people
feeling
betrayed
would
damage
the
country
more
than
the
small
economic
cost
of
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
preferred
brexit
plan
chancellor
philip
hammond
said
on
wednesday
may
s
government
looks
unlikely
to
win
parliament
s
backing
for
the
plan
she
has
agreed
with
the
european
union
to
leave
on
march
which
will
preserve
some
trade
advantages
but
leave
britain
subject
to
eu
rules
if
may
loses
the
parliamentary
vote
on
her
deal
it
would
open
up
possibilities
that
include
a
limited
renegotiation
britain
leaving
with
no
transition
deal
a
new
election
or
even
a
second
brexit
referendum
although
the
last
is
something
may
has
ruled
out
hammond
told
parliament
s
treasury
committee
of
the
dangers
of
rejecting
may
s
plan
and
either
not
leaving
the
eu
at
all
or
abruptly
breaking
most
ties
with
the
bloc
any
solution
which
left
the
country
divided
left
a
large
segment
of
the
population
feeling
betrayed
in
my
view
would
have
a
negative
political
impact
and
societal
impact
that
would
far
outweigh
the
very
small
economic
impact
that
the
white
paper
scenario
is
showing
here
he
told
the
committee
hammond
said
it
would
be
catastrophic
for
britain
if
it
remained
mired
in
the
brexit
debate
for
years
to
come
we
have
to
resolve
this
he
said
a
government
analysis
last
week
showed
a
plan
similar
to
may
s
preferred
option
would
cause
only
a
small
amount
of
economic
damage
compared
with
staying
in
the
european
union
while
a
no
deal
brexit
would
hurt
growth
more
separate
bank
of
england
analysis
showed
that
in
a
no
deal
scenario
britain
would
suffer
a
sharper
recession
than
after
the
financial
crisis
the
boe
would
probably
expect
the
government
to
step
in
to
provide
fiscal
stimulus
in
that
situation
due
to
its
inability
to
cut
interest
rates
at
a
time
when
sterling
would
be
tumbling
and
inflation
pressures
mounting
hammond
said
years
not
months
would
be
needed
for
britain
s
ports
to
be
ready
to
handle
the
customs
and
regulatory
checks
required
under
the
standard
world
trade
organization
terms
favoured
by
some
brexit
supporters
he
said
to
be
very
frank
with
you
the
planning
system
might
struggle
to
approve
such
significant
infrastructure
changes
in
two
years
