eu floats new irish border compromise in tentative brexit plan - ft
london
reuters
european
union
negotiators
have
floated
a
tentative
brexit
plan
to
avoid
a
hard
border
on
the
island
of
ireland
and
to
give
britain
stronger
guarantees
that
a
customs
border
would
not
be
needed
along
the
irish
sea
the
financial
times
said
on
thursday
as
reuters
reported
last
month
eu
negotiators
offered
to
include
a
plan
in
the
withdrawal
agreement
to
keep
mainland
britain
in
a
customs
union
after
brexit
in
order
to
avoid
a
hard
border
the
deal
offered
was
bending
eu
red
lines
which
have
included
refusing
to
give
assurances
on
future
trade
relations
in
the
brexit
treaty
accounts
of
how
british
and
eu
negotiators
came
close
to
a
deal
on
focus
on
how
prime
minister
theresa
may
balked
at
an
eu
demand
for
a
backstop
clause
the
ft
said
eu
brexit
negotiators
were
now
considering
a
new
proposal
to
compromise
on
an
irish
backstop
which
would
be
an
insurance
policy
to
ensure
there
will
be
no
return
of
customs
checks
on
the
border
between
ireland
and
northern
ireland
if
a
future
trading
relationship
is
not
in
place
in
time
the
biggest
obstacle
to
a
brexit
deal
has
been
britain
s
wish
to
keep
the
border
of
its
province
of
northern
ireland
with
ireland
open
preserving
frictionless
trade
and
a
peace
deal
that
ended
sectarian
violence
while
leaving
the
eu
s
single
market
and
customs
union
to
forge
its
own
trade
deals
with
just
over
five
months
until
britain
is
scheduled
to
leave
the
eu
talks
have
stalled
over
the
issue
eu
diplomats
familiar
with
the
latest
briefing
by
negotiators
this
week
said
that
the
eu
proposals
did
not
appear
to
have
changed
significantly
from
that
october
offer
northern
ireland
would
remain
in
a
deep
customs
union
with
the
bloc
applying
the
union
s
full
customs
code
and
following
single
market
regulations
for
goods
and
products
the
ft
reported
meanwhile
the
uk
would
be
in
a
more
customs
arrangement
with
the
eu
in
which
it
would
apply
a
common
external
tariff
on
imports
from
outside
the
union
and
rules
of
origin
the
ft
reported
saying
the
plan
had
been
presented
to
eu
ambassadors
on
wednesday
and
floated
with
uk
officials
the
paper
said
may
s
negotiating
team
would
give
an
indication
next
week
on
whether
britain
was
open
to
the
compromise
which
would
be
a
crucial
decision
on
whether
the
eu
will
hold
a
special
summit
to
discuss
a
potential
deal
this
month
such
a
compromise
plan
is
likely
to
face
opposition
from
brexit
supporters
in
may
s
government
and
party
who
do
not
want
britain
to
be
tied
into
an
customs
union
with
the
bloc
until
a
trade
deal
was
agreed
the
ft
said
the
plan
contained
many
proposals
which
london
had
rejected
last
month
the
same
fundamental
problems
are
there
the
ft
quoted
one
eu
diplomat
briefed
on
the
plan
they
ve
played
around
with
the
ingredients
to
the
however
sterling
rose
against
the
dollar
and
euro
following
the
report
adding
to
earlier
gains
after
officials
said
britain
and
the
eu
had
made
progress
on
a
deal
to
give
london
s
dominant
financial
centre
basic
access
to
the
bloc
s
markets
after
brexit
