cabin

unions
in
belgium
spain
portugal

the
netherlands
are
planning
a
strike
on
over
ryanair
s
labour

they
plan
to
strike
once
a
month
until
their
demands
are
met
some
pilots
associations
are
also
planning
to
join
the
strike
the
belgian
cabin
crew
union
predicted
that
the
strike
would
be
the
biggest
ever
seen
in
europe
and
cause
the
cancellation
of
about
percent
of
flights
from
charleroi
airport
and
probably
all
of
the
airline
s
flights
from
brussels
airport

in
september
ryanair
rejected
claims
by
the
unions
that
the
strike
would
cause
travel
chaos

said
the
airline
would
warn
affected
customers
of
a
small
number
of
flight
cancellations
during
a
walkout
by
pilots
and
crew

this
month
the
airline
was
forced
to
cancel
of
its
german
flights
customers
on
twitter
have
asked
the
irish
airline
about
the
status
of
their
flights
on
ryanair
has
responded
to
some
that
it
expects
the
vast
majority
of
cabin
crew
to
work
as
normal
on
as
they
have
during
previous
strikes
and
that
all
fights
are
scheduled
