may could face trouble over brexit deal, conservative lawmaker warns
london
reuters
prime
minister
theresa
may
could
face
trouble
getting
her
brexit
deal
approved
by
the
british
parliament
before
exit
day
unless
she
changes
her
proposals
the
head
of
an
influential
group
of
lawmakers
said
in
an
interview
published
on
sunday
jacob
chair
of
the
european
research
group
a
faction
within
may
s
conservative
party
is
strongly
opposed
to
the
government
s
chequers
plan
for
brexit
and
favours
a
clean
break
with
the
bloc
on
march
next
year
if
she
sticks
with
chequers
she
will
find
she
has
a
block
of
votes
against
her
in
the
house
of
commons
tipped
as
a
possible
successor
to
may
told
the
sunday
times
newspaper
describing
the
chequers
proposals
as
surrender
to
the
eu
of
course
the
eurosceptics
in
parliament
are
not
in
a
majority
on
all
issues
but
we
will
inevitably
be
in
a
majority
on
some
of
them
and
that
will
make
the
legislation
extraordinarily
difficult
if
it
is
based
on
the
chequers
plan
would
keep
britain
in
a
free
trade
zone
with
the
eu
for
manufactured
and
agricultural
goods
but
some
brexit
supporters
have
said
it
would
mean
parts
of
the
british
economy
would
still
be
subject
to
rules
set
in
brussels
both
london
and
brussels
say
they
want
to
get
a
divorce
deal
at
the
eu
council
but
diplomats
think
that
target
date
is
too
optimistic
if
may
can
not
get
a
deal
by
october
an
agreement
could
be
reached
at
the
december
eu
council
said
letting
it
run
to
december
would
be
very
risky
the
newspaper
reported
as
that
would
only
leave
three
months
to
get
the
deal
approved
by
the
british
parliament
that
would
mean
the
government
must
come
forward
with
a
deal
that
brexiteers
like
because
otherwise
they
might
find
it
s
much
harder
to
get
through
parliament
than
they
think
he
was
quoted
as
saying
parliament
will
have
two
votes
one
on
the
brexit
deal
and
one
on
the
withdrawal
agreement
and
implementation
bill
may
is
betting
that
the
fear
of
a
so
called
scenario
will
push
many
conservative
and
labour
lawmakers
to
support
a
deal
but
the
numbers
are
tight
in
recent
votes
may
commanded
a
majority
of
around
six
votes
on
major
brexit
issues
britain
s
brexit
minister
dominic
raab
will
travel
to
brussels
on
tuesday
in
a
bid
to
pick
up
the
pace
of
talks
with
the
eu
s
chief
negotiator
michel
barnier
but
the
government
is
also
stepping
up
planning
for
a
brexit
said
he
believed
a
deal
a
free
trade
pact
along
the
lines
of
the
eu
s
agreement
with
canada
but
with
deeper
ties
given
britain
s
already
closer
trading
links
could
command
a
majority
in
parliament
if
the
prime
minister
came
to
the
house
of
commons
with
a
style
brexit
people
like
me
would
say
yes
that
s
all
right
and
people
who
are
strongly
would
say
yes
that
s
better
than
leaving
on
world
trade
organisation
terms
said
so
although
that
wouldn
t
be
what
people
might
choose
it
could
