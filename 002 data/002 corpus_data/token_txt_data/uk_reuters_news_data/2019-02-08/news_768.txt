london
reuters
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
received
a
show
of
support
from
her
conservative
party
on
wednesday
at
a
meeting
in
parliament
shifting
the
focus
away
from
talk
of
an
imminent
leadership
challenge
over
her
brexit
strategy
may
has
angered
both
supporters
of
brexit
and
lawmakers
since
failing
to
clinch
a
deal
at
an
eu
summit
last
week
by
raising
the
possibility
of
extending
a
transition
period
to
help
ease
the
deadlocked
negotiations
but
her
arrival
at
the
packed
meeting
was
greeted
with
cheers
and
some
of
those
who
heard
her
speak
said
it
had
gone
well
other
attendees
complained
the
event
had
been
heavily
stage
managed
to
distract
from
their
dissatisfaction
may
had
asked
to
address
the
powerful
committee
after
persistent
criticism
over
the
direction
of
the
brexit
talks
she
s
brilliantly
united
the
party
well
at
least
for
tonight
said
one
lawmaker
who
attended
the
meeting
with
just
over
five
months
to
go
until
britain
s
scheduled
departure
from
the
eu
on
march
may
s
brexit
negotiations
have
stalled
over
a
disagreement
on
a
fallback
plan
for
the
border
between
northern
ireland
and
ireland
many
business
leaders
and
investors
fear
internal
party
politics
could
scupper
an
agreement
thrusting
the
world
s
fifth
largest
economy
into
a
brexit
they
say
would
spook
markets
and
clog
up
the
arteries
of
trade
indeed
sterling
has
already
weakened
in
recent
days
over
the
prospect
of
a
leadership
challenge
people
spoke
very
freely
to
her
about
their
concerns
but
a
lot
of
people
came
back
to
the
fact
that
they
really
wanted
her
to
realise
that
they
backed
her
in
delivering
for
the
country
and
for
government
said
former
interior
minister
amber
rudd
as
she
left
the
meeting
an
ipsos
mori
poll
on
wednesday
showed
a
record
percent
of
voters
lacked
confidence
in
may
to
get
a
good
deal
from
brussels
compared
with
percent
in
september
and
yet
the
public
don
t
put
all
the
blame
at
her
door
and
nor
is
there
much
evidence
that
they
would
have
much
more
confidence
in
anyone
else
said
gideon
skinner
head
of
political
research
at
ipsos
mori
many
conservative
party
lawmakers
are
wary
of
toppling
a
leader
on
the
eve
of
britain
s
most
significant
political
and
economic
move
since
world
war
two
many
also
fear
an
election
could
bring
the
opposition
labour
party
into
power
there
is
an
appetite
among
the
majority
of
the
party
to
pull
together
because
the
risks
are
too
high
said
another
lawmaker
who
attended
the
meeting
but
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
ever
since
losing
her
party
its
majority
in
parliament
with
a
botched
bet
on
a
snap
election
may
has
faced
talk
of
a
leadership
challenge
a
vote
of
in
may
would
be
triggered
if
conservative
lawmakers
submit
letters
to
the
chairman
of
the
committee
to
demand
such
a
vote
the
number
of
letters
held
by
the
committee
chairman
is
not
made
public
the
sunday
times
newspaper
said
had
now
been
sent
and
the
bbc
s
political
editor
said
on
monday
that
the
number
had
not
yet
been
reached
but
with
the
brexit
clock
ticking
down
and
little
sign
of
a
plan
to
satisfy
her
critics
there
was
a
change
of
tone
in
the
british
media
this
week
upping
the
ante
before
the
meeting
some
newspapers
carried
unusually
bloodthirsty
language
by
unidentified
opponents
one
said
may
was
entering
the
killing
zone
while
another
said
may
should
bring
her
own
noose
to
the
meeting
lawmakers
said
that
language
crossed
a
line
for
many
conservatives
and
had
been
a
point
of
common
concern
for
those
speaking
in
the
meeting
