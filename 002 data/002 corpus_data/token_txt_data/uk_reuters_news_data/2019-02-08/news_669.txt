indonesia
authorities
extended
on
wednesday
a
search
for
victims
of
a
plane
crash
last
week
when
all
on
board
a
lion
air
flight
were
killed
and
for
the
aircraft
s
second
black
box
the
cockpit
voice
recorder
the
nearly
new
boeing
max
passenger
plane
slammed
into
the
sea
on
only
minutes
after
takeoff
from
jakarta
en
route
to
bangka
island
near
sumatra
we
have
extended
the
operation
for
three
more
days
muhammad
syaugi
the
head
of
the
national
search
and
rescue
agency
basarnas
told
reuters
it
was
the
second
time
the
search
has
been
extended
but
he
said
search
teams
from
the
military
police
and
others
would
stand
down
leaving
just
his
agency
to
press
on
this
operation
has
been
running
for
days
and
the
results
from
combing
the
sea
surface
and
the
sea
bed
are
declining
therefore
the
resources
of
basarnas
should
be
sufficient
syaugi
told
a
news
conference
basarnas
had
personnel
including
divers
as
well
as
four
ships
involved
in
the
search
and
were
focussing
on
an
area
with
a
radius
of
metres
yards
he
said
a
police
official
said
body
bags
containing
human
remains
had
been
retrieved
and
victims
identified
after
forensic
examination
authorities
have
downloaded
data
from
one
of
the
black
boxes
found
last
week
the
flight
data
recorder
but
are
still
looking
for
the
cockpit
voice
recorder
a
ping
has
been
detected
from
the
second
black
box
but
the
signal
was
very
weak
possibly
because
it
was
encased
in
mud
said
nurcahyo
utomo
an
air
accident
official
at
the
transportation
safety
committee
knkt
a
vessel
capable
of
sucking
up
mud
was
likely
to
be
brought
in
to
help
he
told
a
news
conference
boeing
said
on
wednesday
it
had
issued
a
safety
bulletin
reminding
pilots
how
to
handle
erroneous
data
from
a
sensor
in
the
wake
of
the
lion
air
crash
the
planemaker
said
investigators
looking
into
the
lion
air
crash
had
found
that
one
of
the
angle
of
attack
sensors
on
the
aircraft
had
provided
erroneous
data
experts
say
the
angle
of
attack
is
a
crucial
parameter
that
helps
the
aircraft
s
systems
understand
whether
its
nose
is
too
high
relative
to
the
current
of
air
a
phenomenon
that
can
throw
the
plane
into
an
aerodynamic
stall
and
make
it
fall
knkt
said
that
there
was
a
problem
with
the
sensor
on
the
last
flight
taken
by
the
doomed
plane
from
the
island
of
bali
to
jakarta
even
though
one
sensor
had
been
replaced
in
bali
the
knkt
has
interviewed
crew
and
technicians
on
duty
for
two
previous
flights
while
also
retrieving
the
faulty
sensor
from
bali
for
inspection
knkt
is
planning
to
simulate
a
flight
to
assess
the
impact
of
sensor
damage
at
boeing
s
engineering
simulator
facility
in
seattle
