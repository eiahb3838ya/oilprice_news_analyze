italian banks lead european shares lower after government budget deal
reuters
european
shares
slid
on
friday
after
the
italian
government
agreed
to
set
a
higher
than
expected
budget
deficit
target
that
could
put
rome
on
a
collision
course
with
brussels
shares
in
italian
banks
whose
big
sovereign
bond
portfolios
makes
them
sensitive
to
political
risk
bore
the
brunt
of
selling
pressure
sinking
percent
as
government
bonds
sold
off
and
the
focus
turned
to
rating
agencies
along
with
the
main
italian
stock
index
the
banks
had
their
worst
day
since
the
june
brexit
vote
triggered
a
selloff
across
markets
the
stoxx
index
slid
percent
with
the
leading
euro
zone
stocks
index
down
percent
as
the
quarter
drew
to
a
close
the
index
managed
a
modest
gain
its
second
quarter
in
the
black
but
the
fact
the
three
months
resulted
in
just
a
percent
rise
reflects
the
turmoil
the
region
has
gone
through
in
that
time
italy
ftse
mib
index
fell
percent
while
germany
dax
fell
percent
the
deficit
number
is
higher
than
expected
and
that
clearly
is
not
a
good
sign
all
the
attention
will
now
shift
to
ratings
agencies
which
were
waiting
for
the
budget
to
reconsider
their
scorings
said
gilles
guibout
portfolio
manager
at
axa
im
in
paris
meanwhile
it
s
difficult
to
imagine
that
italian
stocks
will
perform
well
he
added
italy
s
government
on
thursday
targeted
the
budget
deficit
at
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
for
the
next
three
years
defying
brussels
and
marking
a
victory
for
party

fell
percent
its
worst
day
in
four
months
analysts
at
credit
suisse
led
by
carlo
tommaselli
said
italy
s
deficit
target
at
percent
of
gdp
was
not
the
scenario
for
markets
but
still
posed
some
issues
the
key
point
is
that
the
higher
than
expected
deficit
is
addressed
to
finance
new
expenses
rather
than
growth
they
wrote
in
a
note
adding
that
action
from
rating
agencies
was
now
critical
for
the
country
s
banks
a
potential
downgrade
of
the
country
rating
could
pose
risks
to
the
sovereign
investment
grade
and
additional
potential
charges
to
ratios
which
nevertheless
would
be
mitigated
by
the
internal
models
which
most
of
the
italian
banks
adopt
they

italy

two
largest
