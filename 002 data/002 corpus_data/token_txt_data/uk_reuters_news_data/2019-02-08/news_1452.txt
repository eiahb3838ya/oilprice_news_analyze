german
football
star
mesut
ozil
s
decision
to
quit
the
national
team
due
to
racism
and
disrespect
he
faced
over
his
turkish
roots
triggered
a
public
debate
on
monday
about
the
country
s
relations
with
its
largest
immigrant
community
the
most
prominent
german
politician
of
turkish
origin
said
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
head
of
the
national
football
association
to
stay
in
the
role
adding
that
ozil
s
departure
would
only
be
welcomed
by
those
who
opposed
diversity
ozil
s
announcement
on
social
media
late
on
sunday
led
national
newspapers
to
clear
their
front
pages
for
the
midfielder
a
key
member
of
germany
s
world
side
in
and
also
of
the
side
eliminated
at
the
group
stage
of
the
tournament
in
russia
the
player
who
came
under
fire
for
having
his
photograph
taken
with
turkey
s
authoritarian
president
tayyip
erdogan
in
may
was
especially
piqued
by
criticism
from
german
football
association
dfb
head
reinhard
grindel
who
he
said
blamed
him
for
germany
crashing
out
of
this
year
s
tournament
a
spokesman
for
the
dfb
did
not
respond
immediately
when
asked
for
a
comment
from
grindel
cem
ozdemir
the
former
head
of
the
greens
party
and
the
most
prominent
politician
of
turkish
background
said
it
would
be
difficult
for
grindel
to
do
his
job
in
future
given
the
diverse
reality
of
germany
and
its
football
team
it
will
be
very
hard
for
grindel
after
this
he
told
deutschlandfunk
radio
he
doesn
t
reflect
the
breadth
of
football
in
germany
and
so
it
will
be
hard
for
german
turks
or
indeed
german
croats
to
feel
that
the
dfb
is
gokay
sofuoglu
leader
of
the
turkish
community
in
germany
called
for
grindel
to
resign
adding
diversity
in
the
national
team
was
a
great
showcase
project
that
is
now
at
risk
of
failing
due
to
incompetent
former
dfb
president
theo
zwanziger
was
quoted
in
german
media
as
saying
the
dfb
had
not
done
enough
to
solve
conflicts
ahead
of
the
world
cup
communication
mistakes
mean
something
happened
that
should
never
happen
to
migrants
they
should
never
feel
like
germans
he
said
adding
ozil
s
resignation
is
a
major
setback
for
integration
efforts
beyond
football
in
our
the
dfb
said
it
regretted
ozil
s
departure
but
rejected
his
accusations
of
racism
saying
it
had
for
years
helped
to
integrate
people
with
migrant
backgrounds
and
would
continue
to
do
so
adding
the
dfb
stands
for
diversity
a
spokeswoman
for
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
on
monday
that
most
of
the
roughly
three
million
people
with
turkish
roots
living
in
germany
were
she
said
germany
was
a
cosmopolitan
country
where
people
with
migrant
backgrounds
were
welcome
and
sport
played
a
big
role
in
integration
merkel
valued
ozil
as
a
great
footballer
the
row
coincides
with
a
testy
political
debate
in
germany
about
an
influx
of
million
migrants
since
that
has
seen
a
rise
of
the
far
right
alternative
for
germany
afd
party
at
the
expense
of
traditional
parties
it
also
exposed
differences
of
opinion
over
the
country
s
large
and
turkish
community
hundreds
of
thousands
of
turks
came
to
germany
in
the
to
help
it
tackle
a
shortage
of
labour
as
guest
workers
but
little
attempt
was
made
to
help
them
learn
german
and
integrate
a
survey
by
the
wzb
berlin
social
science
center
in
june
showed
people
of
turkish
descent
like
other
groups
with
migrant
backgrounds
suffered
discrimination
when
they
applied
for
jobs
just
as
s
victorious
german
side
was
celebrated
for
its
diversity
so
too
was
france

having
numerous
key

roots

it
was
a
pleasure

abi

brother
in
turkish
but
german
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
questioned
the
debate
around
ozil
who
plays
for
english
club
arsenal
saying
i
don
t
believe
the
case
of
a
multimillionaire
living
and
working
in
england
gives
much
insight
into
the
success
or
failure
of
integration
in
british
body
kick
it
out
said
the
racist
treatment
ozil
had
received
at
the
hands
of
media
supporters
and
society
was
disappointing
but
reflected
what
a
number
of
footballers
with
mixed
heritage
in
europe
faced
ozdemir
said
that
even
if
ozil
had
been
naive
however
his
departure
would
be
good
news
for
erdogan
for
the
afd
all
those
who
are
against
afd
leader
alice
weidel
wrote
that
the
integration
dream
doesn
t
work
even
with
football
millionaires
describing
ozil
s
tirade
as
a
typical
example
of
failed
integration
in
turkey
however
politicians
heaped
praise
on
the
player
and
lashed
out
at
those
who
had
abused
him
what
mesut
ozil
went
through
and
how
he
was
treated
is
unforgivable
there
is
no
excuse
for
racism
and
discrimination
