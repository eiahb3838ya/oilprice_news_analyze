may's party offers new compromise to break brexit impasse
london
reuters
mps
in
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
conservative
party
on
tuesday
proposed
a
compromise
brexit
plan
which
seeks
to
draw
a
line
under
internal
divisions
that
have
so
far
prevented
parliament
approving
an
exit
deal
may
is
under
acute
pressure
to
find
a
way
out
of
britain
s
worst
political
crisis
since
world
war
two
after
her
proposed
deal
for
leaving
the
european
union
was
overwhelmingly
rejected
by
parliament
earlier
this
month
the
new
plan
aims
to
broker
peace
between
conservatives
who
voted
leave
and
those
who
voted
remain
in
the
brexit
referendum
and
has
been
endorsed
by
senior
figures
from
both
sides
the
small
northern
irish
party
that
props
up
may
s
minority
government
has
also
indicated
its
support
it
courts
brexiteers
with
a
promise
to
ditch
an
unpopular
irish
border
policy
in
favour
of
an
alternative
and
appeals
to
conservatives
by
pledging
safeguards
against
the
risk
of
disruption
if
no
deal
can
be
agreed
with
the
eu
but
its
chances
of
success
depend
on
the
both
official
endorsement
from
may
and
a
change
in
policy
from
eu
negotiators
the
eu
has
so
far
been
unwilling
to
consider
reopening
the
withdrawal
agreement
it
reached
with
may
and
which
was
subsequently
rejected
by
parliament
in
a
vote
that
would
be
required
under
the
new
plan
in
order
to
replace
the
irish
backstop
a
policy
designed
to
prevent
a
hard
border
between
northern
ireland
and
ireland
if
no
better
agreement
can
be
reached
the
new
plan
dubbed
the
malthouse
compromise
after
one
of
its
backers
kit
malthouse
was
announced
on
the
eve
of
a
debate
in
parliament
over
may
s
response
to
the
rejection
of
her
original
deal
may
has
not
yet
commented
on
the
malthouse
plan
but
she
has
already
said
she
wants
to
go
back
to
the
eu
to
renegotiate
the
backstop
without
setting
out
what
changes
she
is
seeking
she
is
hoping
that
mps
signal
their
support
for
this
and
add
pressure
to
the
eu
to
reopen
talks
by
voting
to
approve
a
statement
calling
on
her
to
replace
it
with
alternative
arrangements
the
malthouse
plan
itself
will
not
be
directly
discussed
or
voted
upon
during
the
debate
but
its
backers
are
hoping
may
will
verbally
endorse
it
as
a
way
to
unite
the
party
