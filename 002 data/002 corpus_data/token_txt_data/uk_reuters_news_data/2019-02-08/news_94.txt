fears

into

a

partner
at
galt
capital
in
rio
de

at
the
same
time
the
reaction
of
the
government
and
other
public
agencies
has
been
quite
a
bit
stronger
than
in
the
samarco
accident
he
said
referring
to
a
mining
dam
burst
involving
a
vale
joint
venture
this
reaction
has
brought
quite
a
lot
of
uncertainty
about
the
size
of
the
financial
punishment
vale
will
have
to
brazil
s
top
prosecutor
raquel
dodge
said
the
company
should
be
criminally
prosecuted
executives
could
also
be
personally
held
responsible

cut
their

saying
they

pension
fund
and

that
it
could
absorb
the
impact
from
the
steep
share
price
drop
without
the
need
to
eventually
sell
any
of
its
holdings
billions
of
dollars
in
vale

assets
have
already
been
frozen
as
we
discussed
this
weekend
said
michael
underhill
chief
investment
officer
at
capital
innovations
llc
in
milwaukee
adding
that
the
lost
production
from
the
affected
mine
could
be
made
up
elsewhere
in
vale
s
system
there
remains
a
fair
chance
that
all
of
vale
s
dams
which
exceed
in
count
will
also
be
coming
under
great
scrutiny
going
forward
