prime

have
agreed
to
focus
britain
s
migration
system
on
migrants
and
will
not
offer
preference

union
workers
newspapers
said
in
a
nod
to
the
concerns
of

the
plan
backed
by
may
s
cabinet
on
monday
would
also
allow
some
access
for
foreign
workers
the
newspapers
said
last
week
official
advisers
recommended
prioritising
migrant
workers
coming
to
britain
after
brexit
alarming
companies
in
sectors
they
also
said
there
should
be
no
preferential
treatment
for
workers
from
the
eu
the
financial
times
said
that
while
ministers
backed
the
advisers
proposals
the
idea
of
giving
no
preferential
treatment
to
eu
workers
could
change
if
britain
agrees
a
trade
deal
with
the
bloc
that
would
mean
a
better
deal
on
migration
but
the
same
offer
would
be
available
if
we
struck
trade
deals
with
other
countries
around
the
world
the
newspaper
quoted
a
source
as
saying
with
little
more
than
six
months
to
go
before
britain
leaves
the
eu
london
and
brussels
remain
at
loggerheads
on
what
their
future
relationship
will
look
like
and
may
has
insisted
on
new
controls
for
migrant
workers
from
the
bloc
spokesmen
for
may
s
office
and
for
britain
s
interior
ministry
declined
to
comment
on
the
reports
earlier
may
s
office
said
the
ministers
had
agreed
that
britain
would
be
able
to
introduce
a
new
system
which
works
in
the
best
interests
of
the
united
kingdom
including
by
helping
to
boost
the
government
s
advisers
said
in
their
report
that
evidence
suggested
migrants
had
a
more
positive
impact
on
productivity
than
workers
from
abroad
after
she
was
rebuffed
by
other
eu
leaders
who
told
her
last
week
that
her
brexit
plans
would
not
work
may
told
her
ministers
that
they
must
hold
their
nerve
in
the
impasse
her
office
said
after
monday
s
cabinet
meeting
may
said
her
plan
was
the
only
viable
one
on
the
table
and
that
she
remained
confident
of
securing
a
deal
it
said
in
a
statement
at
the
same
time
the
government
will
continue
to
sensibly
plan
for
no
deal
the
statement
quoted
her
as
saying
may
s
government
published
a
latest
batch
of
notices
on
monday
explaining
to
businesses
and
individuals
what
could
happen
if
britain
leaves
the
eu
without
a
deal
the
lack
of
an
agreement
could
hamper
airlines
stop
the
movement
of
goods
to
the
world
s
biggest
trading
bloc
and
cause
headaches
for
pet
owners
who
want
