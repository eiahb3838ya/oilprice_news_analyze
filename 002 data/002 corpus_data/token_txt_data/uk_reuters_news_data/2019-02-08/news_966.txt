brussels in waiting mode as italy budget uncertainty rattles markets
brussels
reuters
eu
officials
were
waiting
anxiously
on
thursday
for
the
eurosceptic
italian
government
s
decisions
on
its
deficit
targets
for
next
year
which
could
challenge
the
bloc
s
fiscal
rules
and
further
rattle
markets
fearing
that
public
statements
from
brussels
could
inflame
the
eurosceptic
wave
in
italy
they
have
largely
preferred
to
maintain
silence
but
informally
admit
concerns
for
its
economy
and
the
risk
of
spillovers
into
other
euro
zone
countries
let
the
markets
talk
is
the
refrain
repeated
by
officials
implying
that
italy
may
be
forced
into
fiscal
discipline
by
higher
yields
on
its
sovereign
bonds
and
crashing
prices
of
its
domestic
bank
shares
rather
than
by
eu
recommendations
market
pressure
resurfaced
vigorously
on
thursday
as
the
italian
press
reported
divisions
within
the
government
on
fiscal
plans
a
spokesman
for
the
european
commission
on
thursday
declined
to
comment
on
rome
s
budget
plans
until
they
are
submitted
to
brussels
the
government
is
expected
to
agree
its
targets
later
in
the
day
and
submit
a
draft
budget
for
next
year
by
privately
eu
officials
say
nobody
expects
italy
to
stick
to
a
pledge
of
a
structural
correction
of
public
finances
worth
percent
of
the
country
s
gross
domestic
product
next
year
the
issue
is
how
broadly
this
target
can
be
missed
under
highly
complex
eu
rules
a
member
state
may
deviate
from
targets
by
a
maximum
of
percentage
points
over
two
years
eu
economics
commissioners
have
repeatedly
stated
they
expect
italy
next
year
to
improve
its
structural
deficit
a
measure
that
strips
out
the
effects
of
the
business
cycle
and
income
and
spending
this
in
turn
would
allow
a
reduction
of
the
country
s
huge
debt
the
second
largest
in
the
eu
after
greece
as
a
proportion
of
gdp
they
have
not
clarified
publicly
what
headline
deficit
figure
would
correspond
to
a
minimal
structural
improvement
but
eu
officials
have
informally
said
between
and
percent
of
gdp
could
allow
a
debt
reduction
a
percent
headline
deficit
could
also
be
consistent
with
a
slight
drop
in
italy
s
debt
which
hovers
dangerously
around
percent
of
gdp
but
only
in
exceptionally
positive
circumstances
the
commission
said
it
had
reached
an
understanding
on
fiscal
targets
with
italy
s
finance
minister
giovanni
tria
but
many
in
his
government
are
pushing
for
a
deficit
above
percent
to
meet
election
promises
on
tax
cuts
a
lower
retirement
age
and
a
basic
income
for
the
poor
that
could
cross
brussels
red
lines
eu
reaction
depends
on
how
far
italy
tries
to
bend
the
rules
the
commission
could
reject
its
draft
budget
after
receiving
it
in
but
this
is
a
nuclear
option
that
has
never
been
used
against
euro
zone
states
who
have
broken
fiscal
rules
in
the
past
more
likely
the
commission
would
wait
until
spring
to
decide
whether
to
open
a
sanctions
procedure
against
rome
when
final
figures
for
the
deficit
will
be
available
that
is
very
close
to
european
parliament
elections
in
may
and
political
considerations
might
weigh
heavily
on
its
decisions
