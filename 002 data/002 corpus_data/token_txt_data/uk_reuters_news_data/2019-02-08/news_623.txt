fox: no one believes "no deal" is a good brexit outcome
london
reuters
british
trade
secretary
liam
fox
said
on
tuesday
a
lot
of
effort
was
being
put
into
achieving
a
brexit
deal
with
the
european
union
as
no
one
believed
leaving
without
an
agreement
was
a
good
outcome
during
a
question
and
answer
session
following
a
speech
in
london
fox
a
strong
brexit
supporter
said
it
was
impossible
to
know
whether
he
would
like
the
final
deal
which
both
sides
say
has
almost
been
agreed
until
he
knew
what
it
was
over
the
last
few
days
in
particular
there
has
been
a
lot
of
effort
put
in
to
get
to
an
agreement
on
the
withdrawal
agreement
itself
and
i
think
all
you
can
say
is
that
there
is
a
lot
of
effort
being
put
into
reaching
that
because
none
of
us
believes
that
no
deal
is
a
good
outcome
he
said
with
less
than
five
months
until
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
eu
talks
are
mired
in
a
disagreement
over
an
irish
backstop
an
insurance
policy
to
ensure
there
will
be
no
hard
border
between
northern
ireland
and
eu
member
ireland
if
a
future
trading
relationship
is
not
in
place
in
time
local
media
have
reported
fox
is
among
key
ministers
who
are
concerned
britain
could
end
up
locked
into
a
customs
union
with
the
eu
i
will
want
to
look
at
the
package
as
a
whole
fox
said
when
asked
at
what
point
he
might
consider
a
deal
so
bad
that
it
would
be
worse
than
leaving
without
a
deal
we
need
to
look
at
any
agreement
in
the
round
and
we
need
to
make
a
judgement
about
is
that
in
the
best
interests
of
the
united
kingdom
and
we
have
to
weigh
it
against
the
for
britain
to
be
perpetually
in
a
customs
union
would
be
a
profound
impediment
to
an
independent
trade
policy
