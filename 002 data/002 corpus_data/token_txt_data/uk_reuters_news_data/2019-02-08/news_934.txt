uk could go it alone on digital services tax - hammond
birmingham
england
reuters
britain
will
unilaterally
implement
a
digital
service
tax
if
there
is
no
international
agreement
soon
on
how
to
tax
big
internet
companies
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
philip
hammond
said
on
monday
blaming
tax
reforms
for
slow
multilateral
progress
the
best
way
to
tax
international
companies
is
through
international
agreements
but
the
time
for
talking
is
coming
to
an
end
and
the
stalling
has
to
stop
hammond
told
the
conservative
party
conference
in
the
english
city
of
birmingham
if
we
can
not
reach
agreement
the
uk
will
go
it
alone
with
a
digital
services
tax
of
its
own
he
said
britain
has
previously
said
it
was
considering
taxing
the
revenues
of
internet
firms
such
as
facebook
and
google
until
international
tax
rules
are
changed
to
cope
with
digital
firms
that
can
shift
sales
and
profits
between
jurisdictions
speaking
at
a
later
event
hammond
said
the
tax
would
only
apply
to
firms
above
a
quite
substantial
size
threshold
and
would
involve
putting
a
value
on
the
content
and
data
of
british
consumers
as
a
share
of
the
firms
overall
value
and
calculating
what
proportion
of
the
business
is
based
in
the
uk
he
said
talks
at
an
international
level
had
been
stalled
by
tax
reforms
aimed
at
ensuring
internet
firms
pay
their
taxes
there
i
have
to
say
my
prognosis
is
that
it
is
quite
unlikely
that
we
will
be
able
to
achieve
international
agreement
in
anything
like
a
sensible
time
scale
because
the
isn
t
frankly
onside
with
this
agenda
he
said
hammond
said
britain
was
also
looking
at
ways
to
update
its
competition
policy
in
response
to
the
power
of
major
companies
the
expansion
of
the
global
tech
giants
and
digital
platforms
while
of
course
bringing
huge
benefits
to
consumers
raises
new
questions
about
whether
too
much
power
is
being
concentrated
in
too
few
global
technology
businesses
he
said
hammond
has
appointed
president
barack
obama
s
former
chief
economist
jason
furman
to
lead
a
review
of
britain
s
competition
regime
to
ensure
it
is
fit
for
the
digital
era
the
confederation
of
british
industry
warned
that
any
tax
moves
should
not
damage
the
uk
s
global
competitiveness
all
businesses
are
increasingly
digital
any
new
approach
must
be
built
on
evidence
from
enterprise
or
it
risks
being
blunt
and
counterproductive
