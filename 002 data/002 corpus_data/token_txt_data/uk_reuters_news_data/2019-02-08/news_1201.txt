sizzling
weather
this
summer
will
put
pressure
on
almost
governments
to
reach
a
deal
in
poland
in
december
on
the
details
of
a
global
plan
to
limit
climate
change
the
incoming
president
of
the
talks
said
environment
ministers
will
meet
in
katowice
the
heart
of
poland
s
region
silesia
to
agree
rules
for
the
paris
climate
accord
that
accord
set
a
sweeping
goal
of
ending
the
fossil
fuel
era
this
century
but
the
text
was
vague
on
details
paris
is
empty
without
katowice
michal
kurtyka
a
former
deputy
energy
minister
of
poland
who
will
preside
at
the
talks
told
reuters
poland
which
generates
most
of
its
electricity
from
coal
is
hosting
the
annual
climate
talks
for
the
third
time
the
paris
agreement
includes
certain
principles
however
the
way
they
will
be
implemented
will
be
described
in
the
katowice
package
so
the
more
detailed
and
concrete
it
is
the
better
kurtyka
said
hot
weather
this
summer
that
set
off
wildfires
from
california
to
greece
has
made
officials
more
determined
to
reach
a
detailed
deal
in
katowice
he
said
for
sure
this
is
something
that
affected
millions
of
people
all
over
the
societies
in
particular
countries
will
act
on
politicians
i
think
that
this
will
increase
political
determination
for
the
solutions
to
be
as
concrete
and
as
detailed
as
possible
kurtyka
said
many
issues
remain
to
be
discussed
at
an
extra
session
in
bangkok
next
month
he
said
where
a
vision
of
the
whole
should
be
built
some
of
the
sticking
points
include
the
way
the
countries
report
on
their
emission
reductions
adapting
to
climate
change
and
financing
tools
he
said
environmentalists
have
complained
about
by
the
countries
involved
french
environment
minister
nicolas
hulot
resigned
on
tuesday
in
frustration
over
sluggish
progress
on
climate
goals
writing
the
rule
book
formally
known
as
implementation
guidelines
is
the
biggest
test
of
the
international
commitment
to
the
paris
agreement
since
president
donald
trump
said
in
june
last
year
that
he
would
pull
out
if
some
countries
such
as
for
example
the
conclude
that
they
are
not
ready
to
follow
the
paris
agreement
direction
then
i
d
assume
that
all
other
countries
will
seek
to
keep
their
presence
so
that
they
are
part
of
the
agreement
kurtyka
said
i
will
strive
for
all
parties
to
become
signatories
whereas
the
question
i
will
ask
at
the
end
will
be
do
i
hear
a
voice
of
objection
i
hope
not
the
choice
of
poland
for
the
climate
talks
is
itself
a
point
of
contention
because
of
its
dependence
on
coal
in
february
the
european
union
s
top
court
said
the
country
had
failed
to
uphold
standards
one
of
several
environmental
conflicts
between
poles
and
the
eu
the
opinions
that
poland
is
not
a
reliable
climate
talks
host
due
to
the
significant
share
of
coal
in
power
production
are
formulated
from
the
eu
perspective
the
world
is
more
diverse
than
that
kurtyka
said
kurtyka
was
appointed
the
climate
talks
president
in
april
he
replaced
the
former
environment
minister
jan
szyszo
who
had
been
initially
named
to
preside
at
the
conference
in
katowice
szyszko
had
approved
the
increased
logging
in
the
ancient
bialowieza
forest
back
in
another
of
poland
s
conflicts
with
the
