boris johnson, sniping at may, calls for 'no deal' brexit minister
belfast
reuters
former
foreign
secretary
boris
johnson
on
saturday
called
for
the
government
to
appoint
a
minister
to
prepare
for
a
british
exit
from
the
european
union
in
order
to
increase
london
s
leverage
in
talks
with
brussels
he
also
called
for
prime
minister
theresa
may
to
withhold
much
of
britain
s
exit
payment
to
renegotiate
its
withdrawal
deal
and
to
dump
the
northern
ireland
backstop
while
avoiding
triggering
a
brexit
the
withdrawal
treaty
s
backstop
provision
could
ultimately
align
northern
ireland
more
closely
with
the
eu
than
the
rest
of
the
united
kingdom
if
no
other
way
can
be
found
to
avoid
a
hard
border
with
eu
member
the
republic
of
ireland
the
proposals
received
a
rapturous
reception
from
the
audience
at
the
annual
conference
of
northern
ireland
s
democratic
unionist
party
but
johnson
did
not
explain
how
he
would
secure
eu
acquiescence
to
the
plan
eu
leaders
have
repeatedly
said
they
are
not
willing
to
renegotiate
the
withdrawal
agreement
and
observers
have
suggested
britain
would
have
to
make
major
concessions
elsewhere
for
it
to
be
changed
may
is
due
formally
to
agree
the
withdrawal
deal
with
the
eu
s
remaining
members
on
sunday
unless
we
junk
this
backstop
we
will
find
that
brussels
has
got
us
exactly
where
they
want
us
a
satellite
state
johnson
told
the
crowd
britain
he
said
risked
economic
and
political
we
need
a
secretary
of
state
for
or
wto
world
trade
organisation
terms
with
real
powers
across
whitehall
britain
s
civil
service
to
make
things
happen
johnson
told
the
conference
winning
a
standing
ovation
i
do
not
believe
that
we
will
exit
without
a
deal
that
is
totally
unnecessary
but
it
is
only
responsible
of
government
to
make
the
proper
johnson
one
of
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
fiercest
critics
since
he
quit
her
cabinet
in
july
has
not
formally
called
for
her
ouster
but
he
is
one
of
the
leaders
of
a
large
group
of
conservative
members
of
parliament
opposing
may
s
strategy
and
is
regularly
touted
as
a
possible
contender
to
replace
her
as
conservative
party
leader
should
she
fall
over
brexit
may
does
not
currently
have
enough
support
in
the
british
parliament
to
ratify
the
deal
she
has
warned
lawmakers
they
have
a
simple
choice
back
her
deal
or
risk
ushering
in
a
no
deal
departure
a
delay
to
brexit
or
possibly
no
brexit
at
all
speaking
to
the
bbc
johnson
said
he
did
not
believe
a
brexit
was
likely
but
added
i
don
t
think
it
will
be
nearly
as
bad
as
some
people
johnson
who
is
known
for
his
colourful
language
and
outlandish
proposals
repeated
a
call
for
the
construction
of
a
bridge
between
northern
ireland
and
scotland
a
project
that
several
experts
have
dismissed
as
impractical
we
need
urgently
to
recover
our
confidence
and
our
self
belief
and
to
stop
treating
brexit
as
if
it
were
a
plague
of
frogs
or
a
murrain
on
our
cattle
or
some
adverse
weather
event
that
had
to
be
managed
