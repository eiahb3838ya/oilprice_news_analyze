former volkswagen boss dragged feet in emissions scandal - judge
braunschweig
germany
reuters
former
volkswagen
boss
martin
winterkorn
was
slow
to
address
emissions
test
cheating
that
led
to
huge
fines
a
judge
hearing
a
damages
case
brought
by
investors
against
the
german
carmaker
said
on
tuesday
the
question
of
who
knew
what
and
when
will
be
vital
in
determining
the
outcome
of
the
suit
in
which
investors
are
seeking
billion
euros
billion
in
damages
for
share
price
losses
suffered
when
the
scandal
became
public
separately
a
consumer
rights
group
said
it
would
file
a
lawsuit
on
wednesday
against
vw
over
the
manipulation
of
emissions
software
seeking
compensation
for
up
to
million
owners
of
affected
diesel
models
the
plaintiffs
in
the
first
case
say
volkswagen
vw
failed
in
its
duty
to
inform
them
about
the
financial
impact
of
the
scandal
which
broke
when
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
issued
a
notice
of
violation
on
judge
christian
jaede
said
winterkorn
had
dragged
his
feet
after
a
management
meeting
two
months
earlier
discussed
how
to
deal
with
regulators
who
were
threatening
to
ban
vw
because
of
excessive
pollution
levels
the
plaintiffs
say
that
from
this
moment
winterkorn
was
aware
of
the
cheating
anyone
acting
in
good
faith
would
have
followed
up
on
this
information
jaede
said
on
the
second
day
of
hearings
into
the
case
at
the
braunschweig
higher
regional
court
this
appears
not
to
have
it
was
not
clear
the
judge
added
why
the
company
had
not
put
out
a
statement
after
establishing
that
engine
software
had
been
manipulated
to
get
around
emissions
tests
the
judge
also
said
it
was
reasonable
to
take
the
view
that
winterkorn
knew
about
the
emissions
cheating
far
earlier
however
thomas
liebscher
a
lawyer
for
vw
said
it
would
be
unfair
to
assume
the
chief
executive
knew
how
the
company
s
engine
management
software
worked
winterkorn
resigned
in
the
days
after
the
scandal
broke
he
told
german
lawmakers
in
early
that
he
did
not
find
out
about
the
cheating
any
earlier
than
vw
had
officially
admitted
his
lawyer
was
not
immediately
available
for
comment
on
tuesday
the
old
faces
criminal
charges
filed
in
may
accusing
him
of
conspiring
to
cover
up
the
dieselgate
scandal
vw
has
also
said
it
may
seek
damages
from
him
the
plaintiffs
say
vw
failed
in
its
duty
to
inform
investors
about
the
potential
financial
implications
of
the
emissions
test
cheating
which
has
cost
the
company
billion
euros
in
penalties
and
fines
so
far
had
investors
known
about
vw
s
cheating
they
might
have
sold
shares
earlier
or
not
made
purchases
thereby
avoiding
losses
on
their
holdings
the
plaintiffs
argue
vw
shares
lost
up
to
percent
in
value
in
the
days
after
the
scandal
broke
the
company
has
argued
it
did
not
inform
investors
of
the
issue
because
it
did
not
want
to
endanger
the
chance
of
reaching
a
settlement
with
the
authorities
jaede
said
this
would
only
have
been
legitimate
if
a
settlement
could
have
been
reached
quickly
and
vw
had
cooperated
with
the
authorities
to
the
best
of
its
efforts
the
judge
told
the
opening
day
of
the
trial
that
vw
s
decision
between
and
to
install
cheating
software
in
diesel
vehicles
was
illegal
but
it
was
not
clear
that
the
intent
was
to
deceive
investors
fund
manager
deka
investment
brought
the
case
known
in
german
as
a
musterklage
or
specimen
claim
the
outcome
of
the
case
could
apply
to
a
further
similar
shareholder
claims
it
s
possible
that
claims
covering
incidents
prior
to
may
not
be
valid
under
the
statute
of
limitations
the
judge
said
on
monday
the
case
is
expected
to
continue
into
next
year
and
may
end
up
before
a
higher
court
