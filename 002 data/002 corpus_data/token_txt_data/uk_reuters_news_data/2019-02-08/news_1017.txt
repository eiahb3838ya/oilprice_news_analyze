ambassador
to
germany
saying
its
position
on
the
country
had
not
changed
sanctions
against
iran
introduced
by
president
trump
after
his
decision
to
pull
the
united

of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
have
forced

there
ambassador
richard
grenell
has
appeared
to
take
credit
for
this
shift
in
a
series
of
tweets
and
interviews
over
the
past
weeks
announcing
the
withdrawal
of
german
blue
chips
like
siemens
basf
and
now
volkswagen
to
the
surprise
of
the
companies
themselves
a

on
thursday
quoting
grenell
said
he
had
led
talks
with
volkswagen
over
the
past
weeks
hammering
out
the
final
details
of
its
new
iran
stance
on
tuesday
however
a
company
source
said
there
had
been
no
talks
with

a
vw

some
time
to
ceos
and
industry
leaders
urging

they
comply

no
major

it
had
abandoned
exploratory

grenell
a
former
spokesman
at
the
united
nations
and
outspoken
defender
of
trump
has
ruffled
feathers
since
arriving
in
germany
in
may
within
hours
of
landing
he
sent
a
tweet
warning
german
firms
to
halt
all
activities
in
iran
weeks
later
he
drew
fire
from
german
politicians
for
telling
website
breitbart
news
that
he
wanted
to
empower
other
conservatives
in
europe
his
remarks
on

s
iran
plans
triggered
more
criticism
bijan
foreign
policy
spokesman
for
the
free

fdp
in
parliament
said
it
was
ridiculous
to
think
that
german
companies
would
make
decisions
based
on
pressure
from
the
ambassador
the
policies
coming
out
of
washington
are
having
an
impact
but
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
ambassador
he
said
urging
grenell
to
be
more
careful
in
his
choice
of
words
the
german
and
european
economies
are
strong
we
don
t
need
to
take
orders
as
if
we
were

occupied
