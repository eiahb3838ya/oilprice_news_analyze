reuters
a
second
trial
between
apple
inc
and
qualcomm
inc
before
the
international
trade
commission
began
monday
in
washington
with
the
iphone
maker
squaring
off
against
the
world
s
biggest
mobile
chipmaker
over
whether
apple
should
be
banned
from
importing
several
recent
iphone
models
to
the
united
states
apple
and
qualcomm
are
locked
in
a
legal
dispute
in
which
apple
has
accused
qualcomm
of
unfair
patent
licensing
practices
qualcomm
the
world
s
largest
mobile
phone
chipmaker
has
in
turn
accused
apple
of
patent
infringement
monday
s
trial
is
the
second
of
two
qualcomm
is
pursuing
against
apple
at
the
itc
in
which
it
is
asking
trade
judges
to
ban
the
import
of
certain
iphone
models
containing
intel
corp
modem
chips
which
help
phones
connect
to
wireless
data
networks
import
bans
are
rare
and
apple
would
have
time
potentially
to
change
the
design
of
its
devices
to
avoid
any
patent
infringement
the
courts
may
find
but
apple
has
come
to
rely
more
heavily
on
intel
for
modem
chips
with
qualcomm
officials
telling
investors
in
july
that
its
chips
are
not
in
the
newest
iphone
models
at
the
first
trial
which
concluded
in
june
a
staff
attorney
recommended
that
the
judge
find
apple
infringed
at
least
one
qualcomm
patent
and
that
some
phones
should
be
blocked
from
coming
into
the
market
but
the
attorney
said
that
models
with
the
next
generation
of
wireless
network
should
be
allowed
to
keep
the
market
for
chips
competitive
the
itc
staff
acts
as
a
third
party
in
such
trade
cases
the
staff
lawyers
opinions
are
not
binding
but
judges
often
follow
them
a
decision
in
that
case
is
expected
later
this
month
monday
s
trial
began
concerns
three
patents
two
of
them
relate
to
how
intel
s
modem
chips
handle
radio
signals
and
one
relates
to
how
apple
s
processor
chips
put
its
iphones
to
sleep
while
blocking
iphones
is
a
drastic
step
apple
would
have
several
chances
to
appeal
the
decision
including
to
president
donald
trump
in
barack
obama
overturned
a
ban
on
some
apple
ipads
and
iphones
that
arose
out
of
a
dispute
with
samsung
electronics
co
ltd
the
more
consequential
outcome
of
the
itc
cases
is
for
qualcomm
to
test
whether
its
patents
are
upheld
under
court
scrutiny
it
is
suing
apple
over
many
of
the
same
patents
in
civil
lawsuits
that
take
longer
to
process
and
the
itc
case
may
give
an
early
indication
of
how
those
civil
lawsuits
could
ultimately
play
out
