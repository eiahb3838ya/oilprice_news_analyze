britain
sent
troops
to
its
airport
after
an
unprecedented
attempt
to
cripple
christmas

to
be
cancelled

drones
which
reappeared
near

every
time
the
airport
tried
to
reopen
the
runway
police
said
there
was
no
indication
of
a
terrorism
motive
behind
the
devices
which
first
appeared
on
wednesday
night
the
assessment
earlier
on
today
was
that
we
wouldn
t
be
using
firearms
detective
chief

late

this
is
continually

drones
were
seen
as
recently
as
the
last
hour
a
gatwick
spokesman
said
at
about
gmt
on
thursday
more
than
hours
after
their
first
sighting
the
airport
said
flights
would
remain
shut
down
for
the
rest
of

on
a
day
when

completely
unacceptable
passenger

had
been
bound
for
georgia
but
spent
six
hours
overnight
sitting
on
a
plane
with
her
children
i
m
very
annoyed
because
i
m
with
two
kids
a
and
she
told
reuters
by
phone
among
thousands
camped
in
the
terminal
they
require
a
lot
of
space
and
food
and
changing
and
all
that
and
the
airport
is
crazy
busy
so
it
s
flights
were
halted
at
gmt
on
wednesday
after
two
drones
were
spotted
near
the
airfield
triggering
the
biggest
disruption
at
gatwick
since
a
volcanic
ash
cloud
in
police
said
more
than
units
were
hunting
the
operators
near
gatwick
airport
km
miles
south
of
london
transport
minister
chris
grayling
said
it
was
clearly
a
deliberate
act
this
is
a
drone
he
said
every
time
gatwick
tries
to
the
runway
the
drones
grayling
temporarily
lifted
restrictions
at
other
airports
to
ease
congestion
caused
by
diverted
aircraft
sky
news
reported
with
a
surge
in
public
enthusiasm
for
drones
there
has
been
an
increase
in
by
unmanned
aircraft
and
commercial
jets
in
recent
years
the
number
of
near
misses
between
private
drones
and
aircraft
in
britain
more
than
tripled
between
and
with
incidents
recorded
last
year
according
to
the
uk
airprox
board
regulator
richard
parker
head
of
air
traffic
management
technology
firm
altitude
angel
said
this
was
the
first
time
a
major
airport
had
been
hit
by
such
a
sustained
and
deliberate
incursion
into
its
airspace
it
s
sophisticated
not
from
a
technology
side
but
it
s
organised
people
have
charged
lots
of
batteries
and
are
deliberately
trying
to
avoid
being
caught
probably
by
driving
around
to
different
locations
he
told
reuters
it
really
is
gatwick
s
chief
operating
officer
chris
woodroofe
described
one
of
the
drones
as
a
heavy
industrial
model
the
police
advice
is
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
seek
to
shoot
the
drone
down
because
of
what
may
happen
to
the
stray
bullets
he
told
bbc
radio
drone
expert
peter
lee
of
portsmouth
university
said
he
and
others
had
been
anticipating
disruption
one
of
my
concerns
about
today
is
that
it
may
well
encourage
incidents
because
you
can
achieve
a
high
amount
of
disruption
for
a
very
very
low
cost
he
said
it
is
illegal
to
fly
drones
within
km
mile
of
a
british
airport
boundary
punishable
by
five
years
in
prison
even
after
gatwick
the
backlog
and
disruption
are
expected
to
last
for
days
gatwick
said
it
was
working
with
its
airlines
the
biggest
of
which
also
include
british
airways
and
norwegian
on
recovery
plans
once
the
runway
safety
was
its
foremost
priority
it
said
gatwick
which
competes
with
europe
s
busiest
airport
heathrow
west
of
london
had
previously
said
sunday
would
be
its
busiest
day
of
the
festive
period
