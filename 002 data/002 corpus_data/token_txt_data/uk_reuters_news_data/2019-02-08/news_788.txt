he
had
urged

the

marriage
riyadh
initially
denied
knowledge
of
his
fate
before
saying
he
was
killed
in
a
fight
in
the
consulate
a
reaction
greeted
sceptically
by
several
western
governments
straining
relations
with
the
world
s
biggest
oil
exporter
but
as
incredulity
deepened
over
saudi
arabia
s
account
comments
from
president
donald
trump
have
varied
he
has
appeared
at
times
to
downplay
riyadh
s
role
in
the
incident
but
also
warned
of
potential
economic
sanctions
he
has
repeatedly
highlighted
the
kingdom
s
importance
as
an
ally
kushner
trump
s
and
senior
adviser
has
cultivated
a
personal
relationship
with
prince
mohammed
and
urged
trump
to
act
with
caution
to
avoid
upsetting
a
critical
strategic
and
economic
relationship
a
senior
administration
official
said
on
monday
kushner
said
he
had
told
the
crown
prince
just
to
be
transparent
to
be
fully
transparent
the
world
is
watching
this
is
a
very
very
serious
accusation
and
a
very
serious
asked
how
the
prince
responded
kushner
speaking
on
cnn
said
we
ll
he
said
the
united
states
was
in
a
phase
on
the
case
and
had
its
eyes
wide
open
he
did
not
say
when
or
by
what
means
he
had
communicated
with
prince
mohammed
khashoggi
went
missing
on
when
he
entered
the
consulate
in
istanbul
after
weeks
of
denying
knowledge
of
his
fate
saudi
officials
said
the
journalist
was
killed
in
a
fist
fight
on
sunday
saudi
arabia
s
foreign
minister
adel
said
khashoggi
had
died
in
a
rogue
operation
but
some
of
his
comments
appeared
to
contradict
previous
statements
from
riyadh
marking
yet
another
shift
in
the
official
story
several
countries
including
germany
britain
france
and
turkey
have
pressed
riyadh
to
provide
all
the
facts
and
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
berlin
would
not
export
arms
to
saudi
arabia
while
uncertainty
over
khashoggi
s
fate
persisted
