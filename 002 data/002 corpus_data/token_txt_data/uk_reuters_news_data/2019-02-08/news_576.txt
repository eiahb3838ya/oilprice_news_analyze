thousands
of
protesters
demonstrated
in
norwegian
cities
on
saturday
against
restricting
women
s
access
to
abortion
the
subject
of
talks
between
the
ruling
minority
coalition
and
a
small
party
seeking
to
join
the
government
in
norway
s
capital
oslo
the
demonstrators
some
pushing
children
in
strollers
marched
through
the
city
centre
carrying
banners
with
slogans
such
as
my
body
my
right
and
defend
abortion
the
new
law
that
s
proposed
is
limiting
women
s
rights
said
ine
lund
a
criminology
student
i
feel
it
should
be
up
to
the
woman
to
when
the
christian
democrats
opened
talks
on
teaming
up
with
the
opposition
labour
party
to
bring
down
the
government
prime
minister
erna
solberg
intervened
offering
to
discuss
tightening
abortion
rules
the
argument
helped
persuade
members
of
the
socially
conservative
party
to
vote
for
talks
to
join
the
ruling
coalition
potentially
securing
solberg
a
majority
in
parliament
until
the
next
election
in
the
christian
democrats
want
further
restrictions
or
an
end
to
terminations
after
the
twelfth
week
of
pregnancy
potentially
reining
in
exemptions
for
genetic
conditions
or
injuries
the
party
also
wants
to
make
it
more
difficult
or
stop
altogether
selective
abortions
in
pregnancies
it
is
discriminating
to
select
on
the
basis
of
having
different
skills
children
with
down
syndrome
should
have
the
same
legal
rights
as
other
children
kjell
ingolf
ropstad
deputy
leader
of
the
christian
democrats
told
public
broadcaster
nrk
earlier
this
month
since
a
termination
after
weeks
must
be
authorised
by
a
panel
of
two
hospital
doctors
if
the
panel
refuses
the
decision
can
be
appealed
in
an
effort
to
quell
a
backlash
within
her
own
party
as
well
as
from
the
opposition
solberg
said
any
changes
to
the
abortion
law
would
not
undermine
women
s
rights
in
practice
this
will
mean
that
in
future
women
who
seek
an
abortion
after
the
twelfth
week
of
pregnancy
will
as
much
as
before
have
the
right
to
have
an
abortion
she
told
parliament
on
wednesday
some
percent
of
norwegians
are
against
changing
the
abortion
law
while
percent
are
in
favour
according
to
a
poll
published
in
daily
vg
on
the
phone
survey
