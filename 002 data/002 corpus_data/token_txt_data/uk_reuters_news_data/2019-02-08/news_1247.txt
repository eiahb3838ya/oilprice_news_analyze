uber
technologies
inc
has
hired
a
chief
financial
officer
the
company
said
on
tuesday
filling
a
vacancy
and
clearing
the
way
for
a
initial
public
offering
next
year
uber
said
it
had
hired
nelson
chai
a
financial
services
veteran
with
deep
connections
to
the
banks
and
uber
must
impress
ahead
of
what
is
expected
to
be
a
large
complicated
ipo
uber
lost
more
than
billion
per
quarter
in
three
of
the
last
six
quarters
still
it
hopes
its
growth
potential
will
attract
investors
uber
must
meet
its
deadline
of
an
ipo
next
year
or
a
shareholder
provision
that
would
lift
transfer
restrictions
on
shares
could
create
a
chaotic
market
of
buying
and
selling
uber
stock
the
cfo
position
has
been
empty
since
when
brent
callinicos
departed
previous
uber
chief
executive
officer
travis
kalanick
had
shown
little
interest
in
hiring
a
replacement
but
the
search
stepped
up
last
year
under
new
ceo
dara
khosrowshahi
uber
s
most
senior
finance
executive
prabir
adarkar
left
last
month
to
become
cfo
at
service
doordash
further
depleting
the
department
uber
s
lack
of
a
cfo
and
the
protracted
search
for
one
had
worried
investors
operating
without
such
a
senior
manager
is
rare
for
a
company
the
size
of
uber
whose
net
revenue
after
payment
for
drivers
promotions
and
refunds
was
billion
in
the
second
quarter
this
year
a
cfo
is
also
vital
for
conducting
an
initial
public
offering

spring
rowe

it
down
under
pressure
from

board
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
matter
chai
acknowledged
uber
must
work
to
convince
public
market
investors
it
can
keep
growing
and
that
it
has
a
path
to
profitability
after
losing
more
than
billion
last
year
revenue
for
the
second
quarter
was
up
percent
over
the
first
quarter
and
more
than
percent
from
last
year
potential
investors
will
challenge
him
to
explain
the
sphere
of
business
at
uber
which
has
oscillated
between
investing
and
divesting
in
products
strategies
and
geographies
this
year
uber
sold
its
russia
and
southeast
asia
businesses
while
pledging
to
invest
heavily
in
india
it
scrapped
its
autonomous
trucking
effort
while
doubling
down
on
its
business
it
bought
an
electric
bikes
company
and
is
eyeing
a
scooter
service
but
retrenched
from
its
car
ambitions
the
bigger
part
is
going
to
be
talking
through
some
of
the
strategy
choices
the
company
has
made
to
invest
in
and
shareholder
return
chai
said
uber
had
a
number
of
executive
vacancies

fill
since
kalanick
departed
and
not
all
have
gone
smoothly
chief

been
accused
of
making
racially
insensitive
comments
prompting
an
internal
probe
