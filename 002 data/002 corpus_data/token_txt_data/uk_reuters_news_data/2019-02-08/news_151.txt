a
taliban
attack
in
central
afghanistan
on
monday
killed
scores
of
security
personnel
officials
said
with
some
estimates
putting
the
death
toll
at
more
than
amid
government
silence
about
one
of
the
most
deadly
insurgent
attacks
in
months
attackers
rammed
a
captured
military
humvee
packed
with
explosives
into
a
training
centre
of
the
national
directorate
for
security
in
maidan
wardak
province
west
of
the
capital
kabul
at
least
two
gunmen
followed
up
spraying
the
compound
with
gunfire
before
they
were
shot
down
we
have
information
that
people
have
been
killed
in
the
explosion
inside
the
military
training
centre
eight
special
commandoes
are
among
the
dead
said
a
senior
official
in
the
defence
ministry
in
kabul
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
local
officials
also
said
that
scores
of
troops
and
nds
personnel
were
killed
in
the
attack
but
there
was
no
official
confirmation
of
the
casualty
toll
with
officials
ordered
not
to
talk
to
media
for
fear
of
damaging
morale
i
have
been
told
not
to
make
the
death
toll
figures
public
it
is
frustrating
to
hide
the
facts
said
a
senior
interior
ministry
official
in
kabul
the
complex
attack
on
a
highly
secured
base
underlined
the
heavy
pressure
facing
afghan
security
forces
as
increasingly
confident
taliban
fighters
have
stepped
up
operations
even
as
diplomatic
efforts
to
agree
a
peaceful
settlement
to
the
conflict
have
begun
taliban
insurgents
fighting
to
drive
out
international
forces
from
afghanistan
and
reintroduce
their
version
of
strict
islamic
law
claimed
responsibility
for
the
attack
which
spokesman
zabiullah
mujahid
said
killed
people
the
attack
the
most
serious
against
afghan
forces
in
months
occurred
on
the
same
day
that
taliban
representatives
met
zalmay
khalilzad
the
special
envoy
for
peace
in
afghanistan
in
qatar
last
week
taliban
fighters
set
off
a
car
bomb
outside
a
highly
fortified
compound
killing
at
least
five
people
and
wounding
more
than
in
the
capital
kabul
but
casualties
from
monday
s
attack
appear
to
have
been
far
higher
sharif
hotak
a
member
of
the
provincial
council
in
maidan
wardak
said
he
saw
the
bodies
of
members
of
the
afghan
forces
in
the
hospital
many
more
were
killed
several
bodies
were
transported
to
kabul
city
and
many
injured
were
transferred
to
hospitals
in
kabul
said
hotak
adding
that
the
government
was
hiding
the
accurate
casualty
figures
to
prevent
a
further
dip
in
morale
of
the
afghan
monday
s
attack
caused
the
biggest
casualty
total
suffered
by
afghan
forces
since
august
when
the
taliban
overran
central
ghazni
province
that
confrontation
killed
afghan
security
forces
and
civilians
dead
as
well
as
hundreds
of
taliban
fighters
said
officials
then
president
ashraf
ghani
s
office
said
in
a
statement
the
enemies
of
the
country
had
carried
out
the
attack
and
had
killed
and
wounded
a
number
of
our
beloved
and
honest
sons
in
recent
years
the
afghan
government
has
stopped
releasing
detailed
casualty
figures
but
commanders
have
said
repeatedly
that
the
losses
being
suffered
by
afghan
forces
are
unsustainable
last
year
ghani
said
afghan
police
officers
and
soldiers
had
been
killed
since
the
british
embassy
in
afghanistan
said
monday
s
casualties
were
a
stark
reminder
of
the
sacrifice
the
afghan
security
and
defence
forces
make
for
their
country
