serena
williams
said
she
did
not
know
her
coach
was
giving
her
instructions
and
had
never
cheated
in
her
life
after
her
hopes
of
winning
a
grand

ended
in
extraordinary
scenes
at
the

saturday
the
american
received
three
code

including
a
game

verbal
abuse
from
chair
umpire

the
final
where
she
was
beaten
by
japan
s
naomi
osaka
after
williams
lost
the
first
set
to
the
japanese
seed
ramos
gave
williams
the
first
code
violation
in
the
form
of
a
warning
early
in
the
second
set
for
getting
instructions
from
her
coach
patrick
mouratoglou
mouratoglou
later
said
he
had
been
giving
her
instructions
but
added
he
did
not
think
williams
had
looked
in
his
direction
he
said
osaka
s
coach
sascha
bajin
had
also
been
giving
his
player
advice
if
i
m
honest
i
was
coaching
i
don
t
think
she
looked
at
me
mouratoglou
told
espn
sascha
was
coaching
every
point
out
on
court
an
unsettled
williams
protested
her
innocence
telling
ramos
i
don
t
cheat
to
win
i
d
rather
lose
i
m
just
letting
you
she
added
in
her
news
conference
that
she
had
asked
mouratoglou
why
he
said
he
was
coaching
her
i
just
texted
patrick
like
what
is
he
talking
about
williams
told
reporters
i
m
trying
to
figure
out
why
he
would
say
williams
continued
protesting
to
ramos
during
a
changeover
but
returned
to
break
osaka
s
serve
to
go
up
in
the
second
set
but
osaka
broke
back
in
the
next
game
and
the
american
smashed
her
racket
in
frustration
earning
a
second
code
violation
and
a
deduction
from
ramos
the
deduction
enraged
williams
and
she
screamed
at
ramos
at
the
next
changeover
drawing
the
game
penalty
after
she
called
him
a
thief
i
have
never
cheated
in
my
life
she
said
i
have
a
daughter
and
i
stand
for
what
s
right
for
her
i
ve
never
cheated
and
you
owe
me
an
apology
you
will
never
be
on
another
court
of
mine
as
long
as
you
live
say
it
say
you
re
sorry
and
you
stole
a
point
from
me
you
re
a
afterwards
williams
said
ramos
had
never
taken
a
game
from
a
man
for
calling
him
a
thief
and
referenced
alize
cornet
being
given
a
code
violation
for
changing
her
shirt
on
court
earlier
in
the
tournament
as
an
another
example
of
double
standards
within
the
game
i
can
t
sit
here
and
say
i
wouldn
t
say
he
s
a
thief
because
i
thought
he
took
a
game
from
me
she
said
but
i
ve
seen
other
men
call
other
umpires
several
things
i
m
here
fighting
for
women
s
rights
and
for
women
s
equality
and
for
all
kinds
of
stuff
for
me
to
say
thief
and
for
him
to
take
a
game
it
made
me
feel
like
it
was
a
sexist
remark
he
s
never
taken
a
game
from
a
man
because
they
said
thief
for
me
it
blows
my
mind
but
i
m
going
to
continue
to
fight
for
women
and
to
fight
for
us
to
have
equal
like
cornet
should
be
able
to
take
off
her
shirt
without
getting
a
fine
