washington
reuters
a
house
of
representatives
committee
will
look
into
a
newspaper
report
that
the
fbi
investigated
whether
president
donald
trump
has
been
working
on
behalf
of
russia
against
interests
the
panel
s
democratic
chairman
said
on
saturday
the
new
york
times
reported
that
the
probe
began
in
the
days
after
trump
fired
james
comey
as
director
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
in
may
and
said
the
agency
s
counterintelligence
investigators
had
to
consider
whether
trump
s
actions
constituted
a
possible
threat
to
national
security
trump
rejected
the
times
piece
in
a
late
saturday
night
interview
on
fox
news
as
the
most
insulting
article
i
ve
ever
had
written
and
lashed
out
at
comey
and
the
fbi
in
half
a
dozen
tweets
house
judiciary
committee
chairman
jerrold
nadler
said
his
panel
will
take
steps
to
better
understand
both
the
president
s
actions
and
the
fbi
s
response
to
that
behaviour
in
coming
weeks
he
also
said
lawmakers
would
seek
to
protect
investigators
from
the
president
s
increasingly
unhinged
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
the
seriousness
or
professionalism
of
the
fbi
as
the
president
did
in
reaction
to
this
story
nadler
a
new
york
democrat
said
in
a
statement
we
have
learned
from
this
reporting
that
even
in
the
earliest
days
of
the
trump
administration
the
president
s
behaviour
was
so
erratic
and
so
concerning
that
the
fbi
felt
compelled
to
do
the
unprecedented
open
a
counterintelligence
investigation
into
a
sitting
president
nadler
said
house
intelligence
committee
chairman
adam
schiff
said
he
could
not
comment
on
the
specifics
of
the
report
but
said
his
committee
would
press
ahead
with
its
probe
of
trump
s
contacts
with
russia
counterintelligence
concerns
about
those
associated
with
the
trump
campaign
including
the
president
himself
have
been
at
the
heart
of
our
investigation
since
the
beginning
said
schiff
a
california
democrat
schiff
said
meetings
contacts
and
communications
between
trump
associates
and
russians
as
well
as
the
web
of
lies
about
those
interactions
and
the
president
s
own
statements
and
actions
have
heightened
the
need
to
follow
the
evidence
where
it
leads
trump
took
notes
from
his
interpreter
made
during
a
meeting
with
russian
president
vladimir
putin
in
hamburg
and
took
other
steps
to
conceal
details
of
their
conversations
a
report
in
the
washington
post
said
on
saturday
trump
denied
on
fox
news
that
he
was
keeping
anything
under
wraps
on
his
meetings
with
putin
the
new
york
times
said
fbi
officials
became
suspicious
of
trump
s
ties
to
russia
during
the
presidential
campaign
but
held
off
on
opening
an
investigation
until
trump
tied
his
dismissal
of
comey
to
a
probe
into
allegations
of
election
meddling
by
russia
the
fbi
also
considered
whether
the
republican
president
s
firing
of
comey
amounted
to
obstruction
of
justice
special
counsel
robert
mueller
took
over
the
investigation
into
trump
days
after
the
fbi
opened
it
as
he
examined
allegations
of
russian
election
interference
the
times
reported
russia
denies
it
sought
to
influence
the
election
trump
lashed
out
at
the
times
and
former
fbi
leaders
and
criticized
the
agency
s
earlier
probe
of
democrat
hillary
clinton
his
rival
in
the
election
wow
just
learned
in
the
failing
new
york
times
that
the
corrupt
former
leaders
of
the
fbi
almost
all
fired
or
forced
to
leave
the
agency
for
some
very
bad
reasons
opened
up
an
investigation
on
me
for
no
reason
with
no
proof
after
i
fired
lyin
james
comey
a
total
sleaze
trump
tweeted
comey
took
to
twitter
later
on
saturday
offering
a
quote
he
attributed
to
former
president
franklin
delano
roosevelt
i
ask
you
to
judge
me
by
the
enemies
