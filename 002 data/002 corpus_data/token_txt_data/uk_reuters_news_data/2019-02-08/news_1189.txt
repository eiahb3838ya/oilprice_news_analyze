aston
martin
plans
to
float
on
the
london
stock
exchange
completing
a
turnaround
for
the
once
perennially
company
that
could
now
be
valued
at
up
to
billion
pounds
billion
the
old
firm
famed
for
making
the
sports
car
driven
by
fictional
secret
agent
james
bond
would
become
the
first
british
carmaker
to
list
in
london
for
years
following
the
sale
of
brands
such
as
jaguar
and
bentley
to
foreign
owners
the
initial
public
offering
ipo
which
follows
italian
rival
ferrari
s
new
york
flotation
in
could
see
aston
valued
at
up
to
billion
pounds
sources
have
told
reuters
after
it
expanded
its
model
and
production
the
firm
which
last
year
made
its
first
profit
since
and
has
gone
bankrupt
seven
times
in
its
history
said
on
wednesday
the
ipo
would
involve
a
sale
of
shares
by
its
main
owners
kuwaiti
and
italian
private
equity
groups
with
at
least
percent
of
the
stock
to
be
floated
it
said
it
had
filed
a
registration
document
with
britain
s
financial
conduct
authority
a
requirement
for
firms
considering
an
ipo
at
a
time
when
the
likes
of
tesla
boss
elon
musk
have
slammed
the
additional
pressures
of
being
listed
pending
a
final
decision
a
prospectus
will
be
published
on
or
around
as
the
maker
of
sports
cars
that
can
cost
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
hopes
to
tap
into
global
demand
from
wealthy
buyers
who
want
a
slice
of
the
brand
the
carmaker
hopes
to
complete
the
flotation
this
year
the
same
target
that
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
is
working
towards
to
agree
a
deal
for
leaving
the
european
union
aston
sells
roughly
percent
of
its
cars
to
the
eu
and
operates
its
only
plant
in
gaydon
central
england
with
a
second
one
due
to
begin
operations
in
wales
in
we
can
demonstrate
that
brexit
is
not
a
major
effect
for
us
chief
executive
andy
palmer
told
reuters
if
there
is
a
tariff
into
europe
it
s
countered
by
a
tariff
into
the
uk
for
our
competitors
so
you
might
lose
a
little
bit
of
market
share
in
the
eu
but
you
pick
it
up
in
the
uk
he
said
niche
carmakers
such
as
aston
and
mclaren
are
more
concerned
about
customs
checks
than
tariffs
as
they
believe
many
of
their
buyers
can
absorb
a
price
hike
like
many
carmakers
it
imports
parts
from
europe
including
engines
which
could
face
delays
at
ports
in
the
event
britain
crashes
out
of
the
eu
without
a
deal
palmer
said
the
firm
had
increased
its
stock
in
preparation
for
any
eventuality
aston
martin
which
has
licensed
its
name
for
use
on
apartment
blocks
and
even
a
submarine
hopes
to
follow
ferrari
by
using
its
exclusivity
to
appeal
to
investors
aston
which
forecasts
volumes
will
rise
to
between
and
vehicles
aims
in
to
match
its
recent
sales
high
of
roughly
cars
achieved
in
just
before
the
financial
crisis
the
firm
then
languished
for
several
years
as
sales
slumped
and
it
failed
to
invest
adequately
in
new
models
spending
most
of
without
a
boss
before
palmer
s
appointment
since
then
the
firm
s
main
shareholders
have
invested
million
pounds
as
part
of
a
plan
to
update
its
model
produce
new
lower
emissions
vehicles
and
make
its
first
sport
utility
vehicle
suv
which
is
due
next
year
it
projects
volumes
will
reach
nearly
units
in
italian
group
investindustrial
kuwait
s
investment
dar
and
shareholder
daimler
will
retain
stakes
in
the
firm
after
the
ipo
aston
made
adjusted
pretax
profit
of
million
pounds
as
revenue
rose
percent
to
million
pounds
due
to
strong
demand
for
its
coupe
and
volante
models
the
company
has
suggested
for
years
it
would
eventually
go
public
but
palmer
said
now
was
the
right
time
as
the
firm
gears
up
for
further
growth
with
its
move
into
the
popular
suv
market
we
ve
got
a
very
solid
balance
sheet
now
very
solid
results
as
we
move
into
the
third
phase
which
is
the
portfolio
expansion
it
also
means
we
ve
got
plenty
of
runway
in
front
of
us
