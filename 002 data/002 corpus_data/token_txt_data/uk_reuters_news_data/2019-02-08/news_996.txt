reuters
opec
s
leader
saudi
arabia
and
its
biggest
ally
outside
the
group
russia
ruled
out
on
sunday
any
immediate
additional
increase
in
crude
output
effectively
rebuffing
president
donald
trump
s
calls
for
action
to
cool
the
market
i
do
not
influence
prices
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
told
reporters
as
opec
and
energy
ministers
gathered
in
algiers
for
a
meeting
that
ended
with
no
formal
recommendation
for
any
additional
supply
boost
benchmark
brent
oil
reached
a
barrel
this
month
prompting
trump
to
reiterate
on
thursday
his
demand
that
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
lower
prices
the
price
rally
mainly
stemmed
from
a
decline
in
oil
exports
from
opec
member
iran
due
to
fresh
sanctions
we
protect
the
countries
of
the
middle
east
they
would
not
be
safe
for
very
long
without
us
and
yet
they
continue
to
push
for
higher
and
higher
oil
prices
we
will
remember
the
opec
monopoly
must
get
prices
down
now

wrote
on
twitter
falih
said
saudi
arabia
had
spare
capacity
to
raise
output
but
such
a
move
was
not
required
at
the
moment
and
might
not
be
needed
next
year
as
according
to
opec
s
projections
a
stellar
rise
in
production
could
exceed
global
demand
growth
the
markets
are
adequately
supplied
i
don
t
know
of
any
refiner
in
the
world
who
is
looking
for
oil
and
is
not
able
to
get
it
falih
said
adding
that
saudi
arabia
could
raise
output
by
up
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
if
needed
given
the
numbers
we
saw
today
that
an
output
increase
in
is
highly
unlikely
unless
we
have
surprises
on
the
supply
and
demand
falih
added
the
statement
from
trump
meanwhile
was
not
his
first
criticism
of
opec
higher
gasoline
prices
for
consumers
could
create
a
political
headache
for
republican
trump
before
congressional
elections
in
november
iran
opec
s
producer
has
accused
trump
of
orchestrating
the
oil
price
rally
by
imposing
sanctions
on
tehran
and
accused
its
regional
saudi
arabia
of
bowing
to
pressure
on
sunday
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
trump
s
tweet
was
the
biggest
insult
to
washington
s
allies
in
the
middle
east
a
report
released
by
opec
on
sunday
forecast
that
supply
from
countries
led
by
the
united
states
would
rise
by
million
bpd
in
while
global
oil
demand
should
grow
by
just
million
it
also
steeply
raised
oil
output
growth
estimates
to
predicting
opec
would
lose
further
market
share
our
attention
is
shifting
to
we
have
been
briefed
on
the
prospect
of
inventory
builds
which
result
from
significant
supply
growth
from
counties
falih
said
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
no
immediate
output
increase
was
necessary
although
he
believed
a
trade
war
between
china
and
the
united
states
as
well
as
sanctions
on
iran
were
creating
new
challenges
for
oil
markets
oil
demand
will
be
declining
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
this
year
and
the
first
quarter
of
next
year
so
far
we
have
decided
to
stick
to
our
june
agreements
novak
said
seeking
to
reverse
a
downturn
in
oil
prices
that
began
in
opec
russia
and
other
allies
decided
in
late
to
reduce
supply
by
some
million
bpd
in
june
this
year
however
after
months
of
cutting
by
more
than
their
pact
had
called
for
largely
due
to
involuntary
reductions
from
venezuela
and
other
producers
they
agreed
to
boost
output
by
returning
to
percent
compliance
that
equates
to
an
increase
of
about
million
bpd
but
the
latest
data
shows
they
are
some
way
from
achieving
that
target
in
august
opec
and
its
allies
cut
production
by
bpd
more
than
their
pact
required
mainly
as
a
result
of
falling
output
in
iran
as
customers
in
europe
and
asia
reduced
purchases
ahead
of
the
sanctions
deadline
opec
put
iran
s
current
production
at
million
bpd
down
some
bpd
from
the
start
of
the
year
according
to
opec
s
secondary
sources
such
as
researchers
and
iran
s
opec
governor
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
insisted
on
sunday
that
iranian
production
was
steady
at
million
bpd
but
appeared
to
soften
his
stance
on
potential
increases
in
opec
output
if
there
is
a
fall
not
only
from
iran
but
anybody
else
it
is
the
responsibility
of
opec
and
to
balance
the
market
kazempour
told
reporters
falih
said
returning
to
percent
compliance
was
the
main
objective
and
should
be
achieved
in
the
next
two
to
three
months
although
he
refrained
from
specifying
how
that
could
be
done
saudi
arabia
is
the
only
oil
producer
with
significant
spare
capacity
the
biggest
issue
is
not
with
the
producing
countries
it
s
with
the
refiners
it
s
with
the
demand
we
in
saudi
arabia
have
not
seen
demand
for
any
additional
barrel
that
we
did
not
the
monitoring
committee
next
meets
on
in
abu
dhabi
