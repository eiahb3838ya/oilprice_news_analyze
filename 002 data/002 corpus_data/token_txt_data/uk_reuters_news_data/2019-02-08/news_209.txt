basel eases capital hit from new trading book rules for banks
london
reuters
revisions
to
global
rules
for
bank
trading
books
will
result
in
a
halving
of
the
extra
capital
needed
from
january
to
cover
risks
from
market
price
swings
the
basel
committee
said
on
monday
it
marks
a
completion
of
a
welter
of
changes
introduced
by
basel
since
taxpayers
had
to
bail
out
undercapitalised
lenders
during
the
financial
crisis
a
decade
ago
banks
had
lobbied
heavily
to
persuade
the
group
of
banking
supervisors
from
the
world
s
main
financial
centres
to
water
down
the
original
plans
for
new
capital
requirements
for
trading
books
basel
said
in
a
statement
that
its
oversight
body
the
governors
and
head
of
supervision
chaired
by
european
central
bank
president
mario
draghi
endorsed
the
revisions
on
monday
the
new
rules
will
mean
an
average
increase
of
about
percent
in
total
market
risk
capital
requirements
for
banks
compared
with
existing
rules
a
framework
published
in
would
have
resulted
in
a
percent
hike
the
change
in
overall
capital
held
by
most
banks
will
be
relatively
modest
however
though
some
of
the
giant
trading
banks
will
suffer
a
bigger
hit
the
bulk
of
a
bank
s
capital
requirements
cover
the
threat
of
souring
loans
while
market
risk
capital
is
far
lower
at
about
percent
of
the
total
basel
revised
its
market
risk
capital
rules
after
getting
better
data
from
banks
so
that
regulators
could
ease
the
initially
conservative
approach
they
took
in
the
draft
rules
basel
committee
secretary
general
william
coen
said
last
april
that
regulators
were
being
left
with
only
a
small
sample
of
observations
to
make
revisions
for
a
graphic
on
basel
market
risk
see
a
key
change
has
been
to
ease
a
test
which
decides
if
a
bank
can
use
its
own
computer
model
to
add
up
market
risks
for
determining
capital
requirements
or
must
use
a
model
set
out
by
regulators
in
house
models
tend
to
be
more
refined
and
result
in
lower
capital
requirements
than
the
standard
regulatory
approach
the
final
rules
also
known
as
the
fundamental
review
of
the
trading
book
or
frtb
ease
what
was
seen
as
a
harsh
pass
or
fail
test
by
including
a
much
broader
amber
zone
than
originally
proposed
giving
more
wriggle
room
for
banks
to
correct
deficiencies
regulators
want
banks
to
better
capture
risks
from
assets
like
stocks
bonds
and
derivatives
held
on
their
trading
books
such
as
illiquidity
or
assets
becoming
harder
to
offload
to
replenish
safety
buffers
in
turbulent
markets
