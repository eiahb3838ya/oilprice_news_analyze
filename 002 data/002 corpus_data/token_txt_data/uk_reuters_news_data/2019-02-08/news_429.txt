eu judges to rule on brexit on eve of may's crucial vote
luxembourg
reuters
the
eu
s
top
court
will
say
on
monday
whether
britain
can
unilaterally
halt
brexit
potentially
offering
a
boost
to
those
opposed
to
leaving
the
european
union
on
the
very
eve
of
a
crucial
and
tumultuous
vote
in
the
british
parliament
in
a
brief
statement
on
thursday
the
court
of
justice
in
luxembourg
said
judges
would
deliver
a
ruling
at
gmt
on
in
a
case
brought
by
scottish
politicians
who
argue
britain
can
simply
withdraw
its
plan
to
leave
in
march
without
waiting
for
the
approval
of
the
other
member
states
prime
minister
theresa
may
is
battling
to
get
a
brexit
deal
that
she
negotiated
with
the
european
union
through
parliament
and
insists
there
is
no
question
of
her
stopping
brexit
but
in
a
vote
due
on
tuesday
the
treaty
faces
opposition
from
lawmakers
both
for
and
against
britain
leaving
the
bloc
acting
with
rare
speed
in
a
case
only
brought
in
october
a
legal
adviser
to
the
court
said
on
tuesday
that
britain
could
indeed
make
a
entirely
of
its
own
accord
such
advice
is
usually
though
not
always
followed
by
the
judges
clarification
of
article
of
the
eu
treaty
matters
because
opponents
of
brexit
want
a
second
referendum
that
gives
the
option
of
staying
in
the
eu
stating
that
this
does
not
need
eu
approval
makes
a
new
ballot
more
credible
according
to
supporters
of
a
people
s
vote
britons
voted
in
to
leave
the
eu
by
percent
to
eu
leaders
have
long
insisted
they
would
welcome
britain
changing
its
mind
but
many
eu
officials
and
legal
experts
had
believed
that
the
approval
of
either
all
or
most
of
the
other
members
states
would
be
needed
to
halt
brexit
altogether
it
is
far
from
clear
whether
or
how
britain
could
organise
a
new
referendum
notably
given
the
short
time
left
until
brexit
if
may
wins
her
vote
on
tuesday
the
withdrawal
seems
likely
to
proceed
as
agreed
with
brussels
last
month
if
she
loses
her
own
position
could
be
in
jeopardy
there
could
be
a
move
for
a
new
election
or
possibly
to
hold
a
new
referendum
many
warn
however
that
it
could
stir
unrest
opinion
polls
suggest
that
any
new
majority
for
staying
in
the
eu
is
narrow
may
said
on
thursday
that
the
alternatives
to
her
deal
under
which
britain
will
for
now
remain
closely
tied
to
eu
regulations
over
which
it
has
no
say
were
a
disorderly
no
deal
brexit
or
no
brexit
at
all
that
echoed
notably
eu
summit
chair
donald
tusk
last
week
he
has
repeatedly
said
britain
can
still
stay
tusk
will
chair
a
regular
summit
next
thursday
and
friday
and
if
may
has
lost
the
vote
eu
diplomats
expect
leaders
to
offer
her
some
prospect
of
further
discussions
on
how
to
make
the
deal
acceptable
in
london
while
making
clear
there
is
no
time
left
for
substantial
changes
to
agreed
texts
but
talk
of
a
possible
british
has
increased
in
brussels
in
the
light
of
the
parliamentary
opposition
to
may
s
deal
and
of
the
ecj
opinion
other
governments
are
concerned
that
a
deeply
divided
britain
would
remain
an
awkward
eu
member
however
few
appear
willing
to
be
seen
to
force
britain
out
as
a
result
officials
and
diplomats
say
most
are
ready
to
postpone
brexit
from
march
at
least
by
a
few
weeks
either
to
ensure
an
orderly
withdrawal
or
just
possibly
give
time
for
a
second
referendum
few
see
the
latter
as
likely
however
the
speed
of
the
ecj
s
intervention
compared
with
rulings
that
typically
take
many
months
prompted
the
likes
of
brexit
campaigner
nigel
farage
to
accuse
it
of
meddling
in
politics
ecj
president
koen
lenaerts
has
long
predicted
that
britain
s
withdrawal
will
end
up
before
his
court
in
taking
on
what
is
known
as
the
wightman
case
after
one
of
the
lawmakers
who
brought
it
the
court
said
on
that
it
aimed
to
rule
before
the
british
parliament
takes
its
decision
on
the
deal
