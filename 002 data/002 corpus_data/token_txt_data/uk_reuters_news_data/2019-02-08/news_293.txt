the
european
union
is
not
trying
to
keep
britain
in
and
wants
to
start
discussing
future
ties
the
moment
the
uk
parliament
approves
brexit
partly
to
focus
on
its
own
unity
ahead
of
may
elections
the
head
of
the
bloc
s
executive
said
it
is
being
insinuated
that
our
aim
is
to
keep
the
united
kingdom
in
the
eu
by
all
possible
means
that
is
not
our
intention
all
we
want
is
clarity
about
our
future
relations
and
we
respect
the
result
of
the
juncker
the
head
of
the
european
commission
told
german
newspaper
welt
am
sonntag
in
an
interview
juncker
said
the
eu
was
ready
to
start
negotiating
a
new
deal
with
britain
right
after
the
british
parliament
approves
the
divorce
deal
a
vote
is
now
due
in
the
week
starting
he
also
said
britain
should
get
its
act
together
and
then
tell
us
what
it
is
you
want
he
said
i
am
working
on
the
assumption
that
it
will
leave
because
that
is
what
the
people
of
the
united
kingdom
have
decided
he
added
refusing
to
be
drawn
into
whether
britain
would
hold
a
second
brexit
vote
that
is
for
the
british
to
on
other
challenges
facing
europe
juncker
said
he
was
watching
closely
president
donald
trump
on
trade
i
trust
him
for
as
long
as
he
keeps
his
word
and
if
he
no
longer
keeps
it
then
i
will
no
longer
feel
bound
by
my
word
either
juncker
said
of
tensions
between
the
eu
and
washington
around
car
tariffs
he
said
he
felt
eu
citizens
were
increasingly
growing
apart
another
problem
to
tackle
ahead
of
parliamentary
elections
in
may
we
have
to
ensure
that
these
rifts
do
not
become
too
deep
juncker
said
we
must
not
imply
that
the
populists
are
right
they
are
just
loud
and
do
not
have
any
specific
proposals
to
offer
on
solving
the
challenges
of
our
he
said
europe
had
to
stand
united
in
combating
the
trolls
and
hacker
groups
from
china
or
russia
that
could
seek
to
sway
the
european
vote
he
expressed
doubt
about
eu
state
romania
which
takes
over
the
bloc
s
rotating
presidency
from
but
struggles
with
corruption
and
bitter
divisions
the
government
in
bucharest
has
not
yet
fully
understood
what
it
means
to
take
chair
over
the
eu
member
states
romania
s
internal
situation
is
such
that
the
country
can
not
act
as
a
compact
unit
in
europe
