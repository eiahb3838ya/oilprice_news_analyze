after tragedies and big losses, hyundai looks to reverse north korea fortunes
seoul
reuters
for
hyundai
the
south
korean
conglomerate
north
korea
has
been
a
story
of
lost
opportunities
and
tragedy
in
months
before
hyundai
was
set
to
open
an
industrial
complex
in
north
korea
the
executive
behind
the
project
committed
suicide
amid
accusations
his
company
had
made
a
secret
million
payment
to
the
north
five
years
later
a
resort
in
the
north
was
closed
after
a
north
korean
soldier
shot
a
south
korean
tourist
both
projects
have
long
been
shuttered
symbolizing
the
difficulties
south
korean
companies
have
had
doing
business
across
the
border
but
emboldened
by
a
thawing
of
relations
on
the
korean
peninsula
and
attracted
by
its
promise
of
cheap
labor
and
untapped
growth
hyundai
is
again
preparing
to
return
to
north
korea
hyundai
executives
and
investors
are
encouraged
by
a
pledge
by
seoul
and
pyongyang
to
the
kaesong
industrial
park
and
the
mt
kumgang
resort
as
part
of
a
warming
in
ties
between
the
neighbors
international
sanctions
over
the
north
s
nuclear
weapons
program
make
it
unclear
how
quickly
investments
can
resume
but
executives
and
investors
are
betting
hyundai
stands
to
benefit
the
most
from
any
peace
dividend
on
the
korean
peninsula
we
have
invested
a
lot
for
a
long
time
and
have
a
solid
and
wide
network
and
business
rights
there
said
baek
a
senior
executive
at
hyundai
asan
the
subsidiary
that
managed
the
kaesong
and
mt
kumgang
projects
combining
all
that
hyundai
will
eventually
be
better
off
in
north
for
korea
inc
struggling
with
high
labor
costs
and
slowing
growth
north
korea
s
cheap
labor
vast
resources
and
huge
growth
potential
represent
an
unmissable
opportunity
baek
and
several
business
executives
told
reuters
for
hyundai
and
its
ruling
family
north
korea
also
has
symbolic
importance
founder
chung
was
born
to
a
peasant
family
in
asan
north
korea
and
named
the
subsidiary
to
handle
the
group
s
enterprises
after
his
birthplace
we
re
doing
this
not
only
for
hyundai
but
for
the
greater
good
of
all
south
korean
companies
baek
said
if
we
restart
our
north
korea
businesses
there
will
be
many
new
jobs
for
us
but
also
for
a
number
of
other
firms
working
with
hyundai
s
ebb
and
flow
in
north
korea
also
illustrate
how
it
could
again
become
one
of
the
biggest
casualties
from
any
setback
in
international
efforts
to
get
pyongyang
to
abandon
its
nuclear
program
other
south
korean
conglomerates
such
as
samsung
and
lotte
have
made
smaller
bets
on
north
korea
and
will
need
to
start
from
scratch
if
economic
ties
resume
both
have
set
up
taskforces
in
recent
months
to
explore
opportunities
shares
of
unlisted
hyundai
asan
have
nearly
quadrupled
to
a
record
high
in
trading
this
year
other
companies
such
as
train
maker
hyundai
rotem
builder
hyundai
engineering
construction
and
hyundai
elevator
have
also
surged
as
the
two
koreas
work
toward
officially
ending
their
conflict
stocks
like
hyundai
elevator
are
now
going
up
and
down
driven
by
anticipation
and
headline
news
rather
than
fundamentals
said
lee
a
fund
manager
bnk
asset
management
but
we
think
there
is
a
better
chance
and
visibility
about
economic
cooperation
than
in
the
past
since
the
two
koreas
are
now
talking
about
ending
the
lee
manages
a
unification
fund
for
his
investment
firm
targeting
stocks
with
potential
exposure
to
north
korea
mostly
hyundai
companies
such
as
hyundai
elevator
but
also
banks
and
logistics
firms
south
korean
president
moon
who
has
pushed
for
rapprochement
with
the
north
since
his
election
last
year
calls
the
kaesong
industrial
park
a
lifeline
for
south
korea
asia
s
economy
is
being
squeezed
globally
between
innovative
manufacturers
and
producers
in
china
and
elsewhere
before
the
closure
of
kaesong
some
south
korean
companies
employed
north
korean
workers
there
making
everything
from
clothes
and
kitchen
utensils
to
electronic
components
the
north
korean
workers
were
well
qualified
hard
working
and
cost
just
a
fraction
of
what
workers
in
the
south
were
paid
factory
owners
said
almost
all
small
and
medium
enterprises
which
used
to
operate
in
kaesong
said
they
would
like
to
go
back
according
to
an
april
survey
seven
out
of
south
korean
companies
would
prefer
to
use
north
korean
workers
instead
of
foreign
migrants
due
to
language
barriers
and
high
costs
associated
with
hiring
foreign
labor
a
separate
survey
by
the
korea
federation
of
smes
found
hyundai
asan
has
the
most
riding
on
the
prospect
of
a
peaceful
peninsula
it
paid
billion
to
buy
exclusive
rights
for
kaesong
and
mt
kumgang
and
has
interests
in
railroads
and
infrastructure
projects
including
reconnecting
railways
hyundai
asan
s
rights
to
land
the
size
of
manhattan
in
kaesong
last
for
years
and
it
has
a
plan
to
build
an
even
bigger
factory
town
if
the
complex
reopens
accommodating
companies
and
north
korean
workers
less
than
percent
of
the
total
property
in
kaesong
has
been
developed
currently
hyundai
told
reuters
officials
say
hyundai
has
also
agreed
with
the
north
to
run
tours
in
the
coastal
city
of
wonsan
which
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
is
trying
to
build
into
a
hotspot
for
tourism
and
foreign
investment
as
well
as

mythical
homeland
of
both

the

is
also
in
talks
with
seoul
and
corporations
about
projects
to
reconnect

the

the

respects
hyundai
s
business
rights
it
signed
with
the

said
a
spokeswoman
at
south

unification
ministry
who
did
not
respond
to
a
question
about
its
discussions
with
hyundai
south
korean
government
officials
and
business
executives
say
the
biggest
hurdle
is
opposition
from
washington
which
wants
to
maintain
sanctions
until
pyongyang
completely
denuclearizes
in
july
mark
lambert
director
for
korean
affairs
at
the
state
department
called
about
south
korean
businessmen
for
a
meeting
at
the
embassy
in
seoul
to
deliver
a
stern
message
no
resumption
of
any
businesses
until
denuclearization
the
mood
in
the
room
was
bleak
said
sjtech
chairman
yoo
who
used
to
operate
a
factory
at
kaesong
and
attended
the
meeting
baek
who
was
also
present
unsuccessfully
argued
kaesong
and
mt
kumgang
should
be
waived
from
sanctions
to
show
our
goodwill
to
north
korea
a
spokeswoman
for
the
state
department
declined
to
comment
on
details
of
private
diplomatic
conversations
hyundai
s
relationship
with
north
korea
goes
back
a
long
way
hyundai
founder
chung
drove
head
of
cattle
across
the
border
to
the
north
in
to
aid
reconciliation
on
the
divided
peninsula
kim
jong
il
the
late
father
of
kim
jong
un
was
quoted
as
saying
our
first
love
is
hyundai
when
it
comes
to
relations
a
way
earlier
than
with
south
korean
authorities
according
to
a
north
korean
book
titled
patriots
who
left
their
names
on
path
to
unification
but
the
suspension
of
its
north
korea
projects
left
hyundai
asan
with
combined
losses
of
million
in
the
past
decade
hyundai
admitted
it
paid
north
korean
authorities
million
in
to
secure
business
rights
there
two
days
after
being
questioned
by
prosecutors
over
the
scandal
chung
s
son
and
successor
chung
fell
to
his
death
from
hyundai
headquarters
indictments
against
him
were
dropped
after
his
death
the
supreme
court
gave
hyundai
asan
s
then
chief
executive
a
suspended
jail
term
for
violating
foreign
money
transfer
rules
but
he
was
later
pardoned

and
visited
pyongyang
in
september
as
part
of
a
south
korean
delegation
for
a
summit
between
moon
and
kim
there
are
many
hurdles
to
be
overcome
but
i
feel
there
is
hope
ahead

us
