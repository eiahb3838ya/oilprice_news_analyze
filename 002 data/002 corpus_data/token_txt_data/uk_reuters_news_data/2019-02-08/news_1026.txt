british
prime
minister
theresa
may
arriving
at
an
eu
summit
dinner
in
austria
on
wednesday
called
on
fellow
european
union
leaders
to
follow
her
lead
and
adapt
their
brexit
negotiating
stance
to
get
a
good
deal
if
we
re
going
to
achieve
a
successful
conclusion
then
just
as
the
uk
has
evolved
its
position
the
eu
will
need
to
evolve
its
position
too
may
told
reporters
on
arrival
in
salzburg
i
m
confident
that
with
goodwill
and
determination
we
can
agree
a
deal
that
right
for
both
she
defended
her
chequers
proposals
on
a
future
customs
and
trade
arrangement
with
the
bloc
saying
it
maintains
frictionless
trade
it
s
the
only
credible
and
negotiable
plan
on
the
table
that
delivers
no
hard
border
in
northern
ireland
and
also
delivers
on
the
vote
of
the
british
asked
about
comments
from
eu
negotiator
michel
barnier
that
he
would
improve
a
proposal
on
the
northern
ireland
border
she
said
that
was
positive
but
she
still
saw
difficulties
with
eu
calls
for
checks
on
trade
between
the
province
and
the
british
mainland
if
the
backstop
were
ever
activated
i
welcome
the
fact
that
michel
barnier
is
recognising
the
need
to
find
a
new
solution
the
original
proposal
put
forward
by
the
european
commission
was
unacceptable
to
us
may
said
we
ve
always
recognised
that
there
are
unique
circumstances
that
apply
in
northern
ireland
for
example
in
relation
to
checks
for
some
agricultural
products
but
what
we
can
not
accept
is
seeing
northern
ireland
carved
away
effectively
from
the
united
kingdom
s
customs
territory
regardless
of
where
the
checks
will
be
what
that
would
mean
is
that
there
would
be
a
challenge
to
our
constitutional
and
economic
she
criticised
some
members
of
the
opposition
labour
party
for
pressing
for
a
vote
to
reverse
the
brexit
referendum
there
are
prominent
labour
members
like
the
mayor
of
london
who
are
now
trying
to
take
us
back
to
square
one
and
are
backing
a
second
referendum
and
postponing
the
brexit
date
the
exit
day
i
want
to
be
absolutely
clear
this
government
will
never
accept
a
second
referendum
the
british
people
have
voted
to
leave
the
european
union
and
we
will
be
leaving
on
the
of
march
i
now
call
on
the
labour
leadership
to
rule
out
a
second
referendum
and
stop
trying
to
frustrate
the
brexit
process
it
s
now
a
matter
of
trust
in
british
politicians
that
we
should
deliver
on
the
will
