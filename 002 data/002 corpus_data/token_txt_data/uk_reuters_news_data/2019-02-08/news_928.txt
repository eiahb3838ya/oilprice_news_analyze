officials
it
said
were
to
blame
for
a
deepening
on
rome
s
financial
markets
the
government
last
week
set
a
deficit
target
of
percent
of
economic
output
for
the
next
three
years
that
tripling
of
its
predecessor
s
goal
by
the
eu
s
second
most
indebted
nation
unnerved
investors
and
prompted
criticism
and
calls
for
a
rethink
from
the
european
commission
we
are
not
turning
back
from
the
percent
target
we
will
not
backtrack

and

sold
off
sharply
di
maio
said
there
was
no
doubt
the
leaders
of
france
and
germany
wanted
the
italian
government
to
fall
while
one
lawmaker
suggested
the
country
would
be
better
off
without

finance
ministers
meeting
in
luxembourg
said
italy
whose
representative
giovanni
tria
was
a
notable
absentee
needed
to
toe
the
fiscal
line
the
majority
of
the
member
states
will
clearly
ask
and
demand
that
these
eu
budget
rules
are
observed
austrian

whose

holds
the
rotating

told
a
news
conference
european
commission
vice
president
valdis
dombrovskis
said
the
current
draft
appeared
not
to
comply
with
the
rules
though
brussels
was
open
to
dialogue
italy
s
ruling
coalition
which
joined
forces
in
june
on
promises
to
slash
taxes
and
boost
welfare
spending
directed
anger
at
brussels
its
other
deputy
prime
minister
league
leader
matteo
salvini
said
it
might
seek
compensation
from
the
eu
over
italy
s
rising
borrowing
costs
the
words
and
the
threats
of
juncker
and
other
high
eu
bureaucrats
continue
to
raise
the
spread
between
italian
and
german
bond
yields
we
are
ready
to
seek
damages
from
those
who
want
to
harm
italy
salvini
said
italian
bond
yields
peaked
at
a
high
on
tuesday
and
shares
in
italian
banks
at
a
low
both
assets
later

losses
eu
commission
president
juncker
drew
parallels
on
monday
between
italy
s
budget
plans
and
the
finances
of
greece
which
emerged
from
its
third
international
bailout
as
recently
as
august
while
the
headline
deficit
of
percent
that
italy
is
proposing
would
be
within
the
commission
s
percent
limit
under
the
current
plan
the
structural
or
underlying
deficit
would
rise
which
runs
contrary
to
eu
rules
the
commission
is
also
concerned
the
proposal
will
increase
italy
s
huge
public
debt
proportionally
the
eu
s
second
highest
after
greece
s
the
government
says
the
debt
will
fall
as
the
expansionary
budget
spurs
economic
growth
on
monday
juncker
said
the
eu
must
be
strict
with
italy
to
avoid
putting
the
euro
project
at
risk
salvini
called
that
a
threat
that
in
italy
is
taken
in
by
he
said
the
government
s
priority
was
to
respond
to
its
citizens
needs
and
criticism
of
its
budget
will
not
stop
the
government
s
task
is
made
harder
by
pressure
on
italian
bonds
intensified
when
euroskeptic
league
lawmaker
claudio
borghi
said
the
country
s
economic
situation
would
improve
outside
the
euro
zone
borghi
did
not
suggest
the
government
planned
to
drop
the
euro
and
di
maio
and
prime
minister
giuseppe
conte
later
reiterated
that
rome
has
no
intention
of
leaving
either
the
euro
zone
or
the
eu
the
euro
is
our
currency
and
for
us
it
is
unrenounceable
and
declarations
suggesting
otherwise
had
nothing
to
do
with
government
policy
conte
said
on
facebook
di
maio
said
rome
s
adversaries
were
hoping
to
use
markets
to
weaken
the
coalition
but
their
bid
would
fail
because
the
alliance
was
more
united
than
ever
economy
minister
tria
a
moderating
but
seemingly
increasingly
isolated
voice
in
government
who
is
a
member
of
neither
party
left
luxembourg
late
on
monday
for
rome
to
put
the
finishing
touches
to
the
budget
plan
the
document
is
expected
in
coming
days
but
could
be
published
as
soon
as
tuesday
