u.s. launches campaign to erode support for iran's leaders
washington
reuters
the
trump
administration
has
launched
an
offensive
of
speeches
and
online
communications
meant
to
foment
unrest
and
help
pressure
iran
to
end
its
nuclear
programme
and
its
support
of
militant
groups
officials
familiar
with
the
matter
said
more
than
half
a
dozen
current
and
former
officials
said
the
campaign
supported
by
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
and
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
is
meant
to
work
in
concert
with
president
donald
trump
s
push
to
economically
throttle
iran
by
tough
sanctions
the
drive
has
intensified
since
trump
withdrew
on
may
from
a
deal
to
stop
iran
from
developing
nuclear
weapons
the
current
and
former
officials
said
the
campaign
paints
iranian
leaders
in
a
harsh
light
at
times
using
information
that
is
exaggerated
or
contradicts
other
official
pronouncements
including
comments
by
previous
administrations
the
white
house
declined
comment
on
the
campaign
the
state
department
also
declined
to
comment
on
the
campaign
specifically
including
on
pompeo
s
role
a
senior
iranian
official
dismissed
the
campaign
saying
the
united
states
had
sought
in
vain
to
undermine
the
government
since
the
islamic
revolution
he
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
their
efforts
will
fail
again
the
official
said
a
review
of
the
state
department
s
twitter
account
and
its
shareamerica
website
which
describes
itself
as
a
platform
to
spark
debate
on
democracy
and
other
issues
shows
a
number
of
posts
critical
of
tehran
over
the
last
month
iran
is
the
subject
of
four
of
the
top
five
items
on
the
website
s
countering
violent
extremism
section
they
include
headlines
such
as
this
iranian

helps
spread
violence
and
in
social

posts
and
speeches
pompeo
himself
also
appeals
directly
to
iranians
the
iranian
diaspora
and
a
global
audience
on

pompeo
tweeted
out

headlined
protests
in
iran
are
growing
iranian
people
deserve
respect
for
their
human

and
iran
s
revolutionary
guard
gets
rich
while
iranian
families
the
tweets
were
translated
into
farsi
and
posted
on
the
shareamerica
website
on
sunday
pompeo
will
give
a
speech
titled
supporting
iranian
voices
in
california
and
meet
iranian
americans
many
of
whom
fled
the
islamic
revolution
that
toppled
shah
mohammad
reza
pahlavi
let
me
be
clear
we
are
not
seeking
regime
change
we
are
seeking
changes
in
the
iranian
government
s
behaviour
a
state
department
official
said
in
response
to
questions
from
reuters
we
know
we
are
driving
iran
to
make
some
hard
choices
either
they
can
change
their
ways
or
find
it
increasingly
difficult
to
engage
in
their
malign
activities
said
the
official
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
and
we
believe
we
are
offering
a
very
positive
vision
for
what
we
could
achieve
and
what
the
iranian
people
could
some
of
the
information
the
administration
has
disseminated
is
incomplete
or
distorted
the
current
and
former
officials
said
in
a
may
speech
in
washington
pompeo
said
iranian
leaders
refused
to
spend
on
their
people
funds
freed
by
the
nuclear
weapons
deal
using
it
instead
for
proxy
wars
and
corruption
by
contrast
in
march
testimony
before
a
senate
committee
the
defence
intelligence
agency
director
robert
ashley
said
social
and
economic
expenditures
remained
tehran
s
priority
despite
some
spending
on
security
forces
pompeo
also
accused
shia
militia
groups
and
terrorists
of
infiltrating
iraqi
security
forces
and
jeopardizing
iraq
s
sovereignty
throughout
the
period
of
the
nuclear
agreement
while
opponents
accuse
the
iraqi
militias
of
human
rights
abuses
against
civilians
which
the
groups
deny
the
militias
fought
islamic
state
extremists
and
helped
keep
them
from
overrunning
iraq
in
after
iraq
s
army
collapsed
they
then
aided
the
offensives
that
liberated
territory
and
some
units
are
being
incorporated
into
iraqi
security
forces
the
state
department
official
acknowledged
that
the
militias
known
as
the
popular
mobilization
forces
are
by
law
part
of
iraq
s
security
forces
and
played
a
role
in
countering
islamic
state
in
we
understand
however
that
some
of
the
undisciplined
pmf
are
especially
close
to
iran
responsive
to
iran
s
directives
and
have
a
history
of
criminal
activity
and
terrorism
the
official
said
those
groups
are
as
problematic
for
the
iraqi
state
as
they
are
for
experts
said
the
administration
also
is
exaggerating
the
closeness
of
the
relationship
between
iran
and
afghanistan
s
taliban
militants
and
al
qaeda
by
calling
them
the
state
department
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
about
the
accuracy
of
the
information
it
was
disseminating
it
is
too
early
to
determine
the
impact
of
the
administration
s
communications
campaign
officials
said
karim
sadjadpour
an
iran
expert
at
the
carnegie
endowment
for
international
peace
think
tank
said
the
strategy
to
economically
strangle
iran
and
stoke
public
discontent
with
the
leadership
aimed
to
produce
one
of
two
outcomes
outcome
one
is
capitulation
forcing
iran
to
further
curtail
not
only
its
nuclear
programme
but
also
its
regional
ambitions
sadjadpour
said
outcome
two
is
the
implosion
of
the
islamic
but
some
officials
and
other
experts
cautioned
that
by
fuelling
turmoil
in
iran
the
administration
could
foster
greater
authoritarian
rule
and
a
more
aggressive
foreign
policy
raising
the
threat
of
a
confrontation
washington
has
long
called
iran
the
world
s
leading
state
sponsor
of
terrorism
because
tehran
arms
and
funds
proxy
militant
groups
like
lebanese
hezbollah
iranian
leaders
urge
the
destruction
of
the
united
states
and
israel
and
iranian
proxies
have
killed
hundreds
of
soldiers
and
diplomats
since
the
islamic
revolution
that
record
provided
previous
administrations
with
ample
material
for
waging
their
own
public
relations
campaigns
against
tehran
including
trying
to
communicate
directly
with
the
iranian
people
president
