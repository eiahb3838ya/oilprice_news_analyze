british
prime
minister
theresa
may
who
faces
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
her
leadership
of
the
conservative
party
on
wednesday
said
any
new
leader
would
have
to
extend
the
march
deadline
for
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
a
new
leader
wouldn
t
be
in
place
by
legal
deadline
so
a
leadership
election
risks
handing
control
of
the
brexit
negotiations
to
opposition
mps
in
parliament
may
said
a
new
leader
wouldn
t
have
time
to
a
withdrawal
agreement
and
get
the
legislation
through
parliament
by
march
so
one
of
their
first
acts
would
have
to
be
extending
or
rescinding
article
delaying
or
even
stopping
brexit
when
people
want
us
to
get
on
with
it
