president
donald
trump
made
a
surprise
christmas
visit
to
troops
in
iraq
on
wednesday
his
first
trip
to
a
conflict
zone
nearly
two
years
into
his
presidency
and
days
after
announcing
a
pullout
of
american
troops
from
neighbouring
syria
trump
was
looking
for
some
positive
headlines
after
several
days
of
turmoil
over
his
decisions
to
withdraw
the
troops
in
syria
pull
out
half
of
the
contingent
in
afghanistan
and
push
out
defence
secretary
james
mattis
two
months
earlier
than
planned
for
criticizing
his
policies
accompanied
by
first
lady
melania
trump
and
speaking
at
the
al
asad
air
base
west
of
baghdad
trump
defended
the
withdrawal
from
syria
and
said
it
was
made
possible
by
the
defeat
of
islamic
state
militants
our
presence
in
syria
was
not
open
ended
and
it
was
never
intended
to
be
permanent
he
told
troops
wearing
camouflage
fatigues
in
a
hangar
at
the
base
he
said
some
troops
can
now
return
home
to
their
many
republican
and
democratic
lawmakers
have
heaped
scorn
on
trump
over
his
syria
policy
saying
the
fight
against
islamic
state
is
far
from
over
and
the
withdrawal
leaves
allies
in
the
lurch
one
of
those
critics
was
mattis
who
said
in
a
candid
resignation
letter
last
week
that
his
views
did
not
align
with
trump
s
particularly
on
the
treatment
of
allies
mattis
had
planned
to
leave
at
the
end
of
february
but
trump
forced
him
to
go
on
after
his
resignation
letter
was
made
public
trump
has
also
drawn
fire
from
some
in
the
military
for
not
having
visited
troops
in
conflict
zones
since
taking
office
in
january
particularly
after
he
cancelled
a
trip
to
a
world
war
one
cemetery
in
france
last
month
due
to
rain
while
there
has
been
no
violence
in
iraq
since
islamic
state
suffered
a
series
of
defeats
last
year
some
troops
train
and
advise
iraqi
forces
still
waging
a
campaign
against
the
militant
group
trump
spent
a
little
more
than
three
hours
in
iraq
on
his
way
home
he
stopped
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
at
ramstein
air
base
in
germany
where
he
shook
hands
and
posed
for
pictures
with
some
of
the
hundreds
of
troops
lined
up
inside
a
hangar
after
ramstein
trump
headed
back
to
washington
trump
was
supposed
to
meet
with
iraqi
prime
minister
adel
abdul
mahdi
but
in
the
end
they
only
spoke
by
telephone
abdul
mahdi
s
office
said
there
was
a
disagreement
over
how
to
conduct
the
iraqi
lawmakers
said
the
prime
minister
declined
trump
s
request
to
meet
him
at
the
military
base
white
house
spokeswoman
sarah
sanders
said
the
meeting
could
not
be
arranged
due
to
security
concerns
and
the
short
notice
of
the
trip
but
she
said
they
had
a
great
call
and
that
abdul
mahdi
accepted
trump
s
invitation
to
the
white
house
in
the
new
year
the
unannounced
visit
in
iraq
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
two
of
trump
s
predecessors
republican
george
bush
and
democrat
barack
obama
who
both
made
surprise
trips
to
see
troops
for
security
reasons
the
visits
are
usually
kept
secret
until
after
the
president
arrives
a
small
group
of
aides
and
secret
service
agents
and
a
pool
of
reporters
were
with
trump
and
the
first
lady
on
the
overnight
flight
from
washington
trump
said
his
main
security
concern
was
for
the
first
lady
while
in
iraq
trump
also
spoke
to
military
commanders
and
the
ambassador
sanders
said
they
came
up
with
a
powerful
plan
that
will
allow
us
to
continue
our
path
to
total
victory
over
islamic
state
unlike
syria
trump
said
he
had
no
plans
to
withdraw
from
iraq
trump
has
had
an
uneven
relationship
with
america
s
military
he
did
not
have
to
serve
during
the
vietnam
war
after
being
diagnosed
with
bone
spurs
in
his
heels
as
trump
was
drawn
to
the
brawn
of
the
armed
forces
and
stacked
his
first
cabinet
with
generals
many
of
whom
have
since
left
his
administration
trump
has
also
wanted
to
end
protracted
involvement
in
overseas
conflicts
and
to
force
allies
to
pay
more
of
the
costs
that
he
says
fall
disproportionately
on
american
taxpayers
a
point
he
made
again
on
wednesday
trump
spoke
to
troops
gathered
in
a
dining
hall
festooned
with
holiday
decorations
and
teased
soldiers
about
their
favourite
football
teams
to
reporters
he
lamented
the
wear
and
tear
of
overseas
conflicts
it
s
time
to
get
our
young
people
out
trump
said
and
i
ve
been
signing
plenty
of
letters
and
i
don
t
like
sending
those
letters
home
to
parents
saying
that
your
young
man
or
your
young
woman
has
been
killed
i
don
t
like
doing
it
