president
donald
trump
exhorts
throngs
of
supporters
to
treat
next
week
s
congressional
elections
as
a
referendum
on
trumpism
and
the
movement
that
swept
him
to
power
you

me
in
trump
told
a
raucous
crowd
in
a
late
september
appearance
for
republican
candidates
in
missouri
you
re
voting
for
the
plea
speaks
to
the
challenge
facing
the
president
and
his
supporters
with
democrats
threatening
to
take
over
the
house
of
representatives
and
key
governors
offices
the
success
of
his
legislative
agenda
over
the
next
two
years
hinges
on
whether
he
can
energise
his
backers
around
candidates
who
are
not
named
trump
this
year
s
election
is
the
first
real
test
of
whether
the
coalition
behind
trump
s
make
america
great
again
slogan
can
evolve
from
a
diffuse
following
to
an
organised
political
force
able
to
boost
candidates
outside
his
electoral
strongholds
reuters
surveyed
officials
from
republican
campaigns
analysed
data
from
polling
partner
ipsos
and
interviewed
dozens
of
candidates
strategists
and
trump
supporters
to
assess
the
reach
and
influence
of
the
president
s
maga
movement
ahead
of
the
elections
united
behind
trump
s
america
first
agenda
of
tighter
borders
protectionist
economic
policies
and
unilateralist
diplomacy
the
maga
coalition
swept
up
voters
who
felt
ignored
by
washington
and
welcomed
trump
s
vows
to
upend
its
institutions
today
it
attracts
tea
party
conservatives
evangelical
christians
gun
rights
advocates
and
voters
drawn
to
trump
s
outsider
persona
trump
s
populist
base
is
firmly
established
in
the
mostly
southern
and
western
parts
of
the
country
where
he
s
most
popular
maga
supporters
turn
out
in
force
for
candidates
in
those
areas
boosting
them
in
opinion
polls
and
volunteering
for
their
campaigns
in
some
cases
they
have
taken
control
of
state
party
machines
harnessing
their
infrastructure
and
money
for
candidates
in
trump
s
mould
but
outside
of
trump
s
strongholds
the
influence
of
maga
supporters
is
more
pocketed
especially
in
rust
belt
states
such
as
pennsylvania
and
ohio
and
the
upper
midwest
so
while
trump
loyalists
can
tip
the
scales
in
specific
house
districts
in
those
areas
they
have
done
less
to
boost
candidates
in
statewide
contests
for
governor
and
senate
with
no
central
organisation
and
little
regard
for
republican
hierarchies
maga
enthusiasts
agitate
largely
through
social
media
and
internet
forums
such
as
facebook
and
reddit
the
social
networking
site
in
dozens
of
interviews
reuters
found
their
willingness
to
back
local
campaigns
often
has
less
to
do
with
party
loyalty
than
with
helping
trump
the
elections
will
be
a
test
of
how
popular
trump
is
how
popular
his
policies
are
did
we
organise
well
or
do
we
need
to
do
better
and
improve
things
for
said
scott
presler
a
maga
activist
in
virginia
beach
virginia
among
the
republicans
running
for
senate
or
governor
in
states
where
trump
won
the
presidential
race
by
more
than
percentage
points
in
more
than
percent
are
ahead
in
opinion
polls
based
on
data
aggregated
by
realclearpolitics
and
websites
that
gather
polling
from
multiple
sources
yet
among
the
candidates
for
senate
or
governor
in
states
where
he
won
by
fewer
than
points
just
four
a
quarter
are
polling
ahead
the
challenge
is
starkest
where
candidates
are
trying
to
flip
governors
offices
and
senate
seats
held
by
democrats
reuters
found
in
states
where
trump
won
by
double
digits
in
two
of
the
five
candidates
he
has
endorsed
in
races
for
senate
and
governors
seats
are
leading
in
the
polls
and
two
others
are
within
a
few
points
but
in
states
where
trump
won
by
less
than
points
all
six
candidates
he
has
endorsed
in
races
for
democratic
seats
are
behind
in
recent
polls
five
of
them
by
at
least
points
through
much
of
the
campaign
season
trump
supporters
in
many
places
were
leaning
on
their
shovels
because
they
were
of
victory
steve
bannon
a
former
trump
adviser
and
campaign
strategist
told
reuters
maga
loyalists
have
grown
more
energized
in
recent
weeks
realizing
trump
s
agenda
would
come
grinding
to
a
halt
if
democrats
capture
the
house
bannon
added
you
ve
seen
the
establishment
and
the
hardcore
in
the
trump
base
all
come
the
president
remains
enormously
popular
with
that
base
polling
gives
him
an
percent
approval
rate
among
republicans
and
more
than
of
those
who
voted
for
him
in
say
they
identify
with
maga
ideals
yet
their
views
diverge
on
what
maga
means
while
more
than
half
equate
it
with
strengthening
the
economy
and
tightening
borders
upwards
of
a
quarter
say
maga
simply
means
donald

raises

once

on
trump
whipped
up
a
crowd
of
nearly
at
a
rally
supporting
marsha
blackburn
s
senate
campaign
in
tennessee
where
trump
won
in
by
points
a
vote
for
marsha
is
really
a
vote
for
me
and
everything
that
we
stand
for
he
told
the
audience
soon
after
opinion
polls
showed
blackburn
a
house
member
pulling
ahead
of
her
democratic
opponent
former
governor
phil
bredesen
we
knew
president
trump
would
be
an
extraordinary
surrogate
in
east
tennessee
republican
party
spokesman
garren
shipley
told
reuters
bredesen
s
campaign
dismissed
the
polls
the
only
poll
that
matters
is
on
election
day
said
spokeswoman
alyssa
hansen
on
the
president
held
another
rally
miles
km
away
with
a
similar
message
for
lou
barletta
s
senate
campaign
in
pennsylvania
where
trump
eked
out
a
victory
in
i
need
you
trump
told
the
crowd
vote
for
lou
it
was
trump
s
second
rally
with
barletta
since
august
but
barletta
also
a
house
member
trails
incumbent
democratic
senator
bob
casey
and
has
remained
behind
by
more
than
points
in
polls
the
divergent
fortunes
of
blackburn
and
barletta
reflect
the
challenge
in
harnessing
trump
s
maga
coalition
following
trump
s
victory
in
tennessee
s
republican
establishment
embraced
his
agenda
and
welcomed
his
supporters
many
are
volunteering
now
for
blackburn
and
other
candidates
helping
with
phone
banks
neighbourhood
canvassing
and
other
efforts
the
state
party
leaders
who
didn
t
support
trump
initially
have
figured
out
they
have
to
help
him
says
todd
fowler
who
heads
the
local
party
in
johnson
city
tennessee
and
serves
on
the
state
party
s
executive
committee
tennessee
likes
what
he
s
in
pennsylvania
where
trump
s
win
was
his
support

mostly
concentrated
in
rural

trump
s
pick
for
governor
scott

running
well
behind
incumbent
democratic
governor
tom
wolf
trump
is
drawing
people
to
congressional
campaigns
in
pennsylvania
but
they
are
coming
very
tentatively
says
eugene
sorrentino
a
retired
power
company
technician
and
member
of
the
local
republican
committee
in
erie
pennsylvania
sorrentino
recently
staffed
a
welcome
tent
set
up
by
the
party
at
a
county
fair
and
all
i
heard
was
requests
for
trump
paraphernalia
he
said
the
congressional
races
weren
t
on
their
agenda
he
added
in
trump
s
strongholds
his
ability
to
help
candidates
goes
beyond
a
bounce
in
the
polls
nearly
all
the
campaigns
contacted
by
reuters
reported
a
surge
of
volunteer
activism
a
trump
bump
after
the
president
s
endorsement
in
western
pennsylvania
a
corner
where
trump
is
enormously
popular
representative
mike
kelly
says
his
campaign
relies
heavily
on
maga
volunteers
kelly
s
district
redrawn
this
year
includes
counties
where
trump
won
by
as
much
as
points
in
according
to
a
nonpartisan
group
trump
provides
that
shot
of
adrenaline
you
need
from
time
to
time
kelly
told
reuters
as
he
prepared
to
join
the
president
for
an
rally
in
erie
one
engine

turning
out
trump

base
in
his
stronghold

america
first

a
super
pac
allowed
to
spend
unlimited
amounts
of
money
on

the
group
has
spent
more
than
million
on
phone
messaging
and
advertising
in
five
battleground
senate
races
arizona
montana
indiana
missouri
and
north
dakota
and
across
congressional
districts
in
texas
minnesota
maine
michigan
west
virginia
new

pennsylvania
nevada
and
north
carolina
it
is
run
by
trump
loyalists
and
relies
on
big
donations
from
republican
party
stalwarts

casino
magnates
sheldon
adelson
and
steve
wynn
and
mining

and
businessman
robert
murray
in
an
memo
white
house
political
director
bill
stepian
advised
congressional
campaigns
that
the
best
way
to
capture
maga
support
is
to
align
closely
clearly
and
boldly
with
trump
the
president
he
wrote
is
ready
willing
and
able
to
put
the
power
and
force
of
his
coalition
to
work
for
the
candidates
with
whom
he
stands
and
who
stand
with
at
the
national
level
republican
party
officials
have
fallen
in
line
and
embraced
the
president
routinely
echoing
trump
s
nationalist
campaign
themes
but
for
candidates
in
areas
where
the
president
doesn
t
dominate
the
electorate
embracing
trump
has
mixed
success
in
florida
where
trump
prevailed
by
one
point
in
he
endorsed
republican
gubernatorial
candidate
and
supporter
ron
desantis
before
the
party
primary
but
now
in
a
state
that
hasn
t
elected
a
democratic
governor
in
years
desantis
is
polling
slightly
behind
in
the
general
election
contest
against
andrew
gillum
the
democratic
mayor
of
tallahassee
some
republican
candidates
in
areas
with
moderate
voters
who
view
trump
less
favourably
have
steered
clear
of
the
president
a
reuters
analysis
found
last
month
maga
supporters
have
become
a
force
in
many
state
party
offices
including
some
states
outside
the
president
s
established
southern
and
western
strongholds
in
ohio
a
swing
state
where
trump
won
by
eight
points
in
the
state
republican
party
selected
jane
timken
a
trump
friend
and
loyalist
to
take
over
as
chairwoman
in
the
wake
of
the
election
in
nevada
where
democrat
hillary
clinton
won
the
presidential
vote
the
state
republican
party
has
launched
weekly
events
such
as
maga
mondays
and
trump
tuesdays
to
attract
the
president
s
supporters
rochelle
swanson
a
maga
activist
in
reno
who
began
posting
articles
and
interviewing
local
republican
candidates
on
social
media
was
asked
by
a
party
official
in
july
to
help
with
voter
outreach
she
now
aligns
her
social
media
and
canvassing
with
the
party
s
messaging
she
says
and
there
is
good
unity
yet
even
as
maga
supporters
have
become
woven
into
the
fabric
of
the
republican
party
many
acknowledge
it
will
be
a
challenge
to
preserve
their
coalition
and
continue
shaping
politics
once
trump
leaves
office
in
a
poll
earlier
this
month
more
than
a
quarter
of
trump
voters
said
they
did
not
know
who
would
carry
trump
s
vision
if
he
leaves
politics
i
don

think
anybody
could
take
trump
s
spot
