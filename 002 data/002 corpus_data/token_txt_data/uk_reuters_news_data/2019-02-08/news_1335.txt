reuters
russia
s
embassy
in
the
united
states
on
thursday
called
new
sanctions
draconian
and
said
the
reason
for
the
new
restrictions
allegations
it
poisoned
a
former
spy
and
his
daughter
in
britain
were
the
united
states
on
wednesday
announced
it
would
impose
fresh
sanctions
on
russia
after
washington
determined
moscow
had
used
a
nerve
agent
against
a
former
russian
double
agent
sergei
skripal
and
his
daughter
yulia
in
britain
russia
has
repeatedly
denied
responsibility
for
the
attack
and
russia
s
embassy
in
washington
said
in
a
statement
that
washington
s
findings
against
it
in
the
case
were
not
backed
by
evidence
on
august
our
deputy
chief
of
mission
was
informed
in
the
state
department
of
new
draconian
sanctions
against
russia
for
accusations
of
using
the
novichok
nerve
agent
against
a
uk
citizen
the
embassy
said
in
a
statement
we
grew
accustomed
to
not
hearing
any
facts
or
the
announcement
fuelled
already
worsening
investor
sentiment
about
the
possible
effect
of
more
sanctions
on
russian
assets
and
the
rouble
slid
by
over
percent
on
thursday
against
the
dollar
a
day
after
falling
towards
its
lowest
level
in
nearly
two
years
the
russian
embassy
said
moscow
continued
to
advocate
for
an
open
and
transparent
investigation
into
the
poisoning
sergei
skripal
a
former
colonel
in
russia
s
gru
military
intelligence
service
and
his
daughter
yulia
were
found
slumped
unconscious
on
a
bench
in
the
southern
english
city
of
salisbury
in
march
after
a
liquid
form
of
the
novichok
type
of
nerve
agent
was
applied
to
his
home
s
front
door
european
countries
and
the
united
states
expelled
russian
diplomats
after
the
attack
in
the
strongest
action
by
president
donald
trump
against
russia
since
he
came
to
office
the
new
sanctions
would
cover
sensitive
controlled
goods
a
senior
state
department
official
told
reporters
there
would
however
be
exemptions
for
space
flight
activities
government
space
cooperation
and
areas
covering
commercial
passenger
aviation
safety
which
would
be
reviewed
on
a
case
by
case
basis
the
official
added
the
official
said
a
second
batch
of
more
draconian
sanctions
would
be
imposed
after
days
unless
russia
gave
reliable
assurances
it
would
no
longer
use
chemical
weapons
and
allow
inspections
by
the
united
nations
or
other
international
observer
groups
given
that
russia
flatly
denies
involvement
in
the
incident
it
appears
unlikely
to
accede
to
the
demands
