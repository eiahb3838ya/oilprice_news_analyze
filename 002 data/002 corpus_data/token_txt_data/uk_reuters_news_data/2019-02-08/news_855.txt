francis
to
visit
its
president
tsai
said
just
weeks
after
the
vatican
reached
a
milestone
deal
on
the
appointment
of
bishops
with
china
which
claims
the
island
as
its
own
last
month
s
deal
gives
the
holy
see
taiwan
s
last
remaining
diplomatic
ally
in
europe
a
say
over
such
appointments
although
both
sides
call
it
provisional
and
sources
have
said
some
key
issues
remain
unresolved
taiwan
vice
president
chen
met
francis
on
sunday
and
invited
him
to
visit
tsai
s
office
said
in
a
statement
adding
that
the
pope
had
replied
he
would
pray
for
taiwan
but
it
gave
no
date
for
the
proposed
visit
chen
emphasized
the
provisional
nature
of
the
agreement
between
the
vatican
and
china
saying
it
did
not
involve
a
diplomatic
element
or
affect
the
friendship
between
taiwan
and
the
vatican
the
statement
added
we
urge
everyone
not
to
excessively
interpret
and
worry
about
this
deal
it
quoted
chen
as
saying
on
social
media
tsai
thanked
the
pope
for
his
blessings
we
will
take
active
and
concrete
actions
to
support
the
pope
and
to
transmit
our
common
values
of
freedom
justice
peace
and
care
to
all
corners
of
the
world
she
wrote
although
the
vatican
says
its
deal
is
not
political
some
taiwan
officials
worry
it
could
be
a
prelude
to
establishing
diplomatic
ties
with
beijing
and
taiwan
s
vatican
envoy
has
said
china
wants
to
make
the
island
irrelevant
taipei
has
routinely
accused
china
which
considers
it
a
breakaway
province
and
has
never
ruled
out
the
use
of
force
to
return
it
to
the
fold
of
using
dollar
diplomacy
and
bullying
to
lure
away
its
allies
charges
beijing
has
denied
this
year
former
allies
el
salvador
burkina
faso
and
the
dominican
republic
switched
ties
to
beijing
from
taipei
leaving
it
with
just
formal
allies
mostly
less
developed
nations
in
central
america
and
the
pacific
on
in
the
first
sign
of
a
thaw
after
the
pact
which
was
more
than
years
in
the
making
the
vatican
said
beijing
would
for
the
first
time
allow
chinese
bishops
to
attend
a
major
vatican
meeting
the
meeting
known
as
a
synod
began
on
and
runs
until
however
michael
yeung
the
bishop
of
hong
kong
told
reuters
it
will
take
time
to
tackle
issues
beyond
the
appointment
of
bishops
and
he
feared
suppression
of
catholics
in
mainland
china
would
continue
despite
the
accord
about
a
dozen
bishops
and
priests
some
elderly
remain
in
detention
in
china
some
have
not
been
heard
from
in
decades
beijing
has
provided
little
clear
information
about
their
fate
this
version
of
the
story
has
been
refiled
to
change
dateline
to
taipei
