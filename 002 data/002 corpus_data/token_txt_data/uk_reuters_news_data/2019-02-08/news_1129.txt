north
korea
s
kim
jong
un
has
given
his
first
time
line
for
denuclearisation
aiming
for
the
end
of
president
donald
trump
s
first
term
seoul
officials
said
on
thursday
prompting
thanks
from
trump
who
said
they
would
get
it
done
together
kim
and
south
korean
president
moon
will
meet
in
pyongyang
on
for
a
third
summit
and
discuss
practical
measures
towards
denuclearisation
moon
s
national
security
adviser
chung
said
a
day
after
meeting
kim
the
summit
could
provide
renewed
momentum
to
talks
over
denuclearisation
between
north
korea
and
the
united
states
after
trump
cancelled
a
visit
to
pyongyang
by
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
last
month
citing
lack
of
progress
kim
told
south
korean
officials
his
faith
in
trump
was
unchanged
and
that
he
wanted
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
and
an
end
to
hostile
relations
with
the
united
states
before
trump
s
first
term
ends
in
early
chung
said
but
there
was
no
indication
that
kim
had
offered
concrete
steps
towards
giving
up
his
nuclear
arsenal
something
some
officials
have
said
privately
they
doubt
he
is
willing
to
do
he
particularly
emphasised
that
he
has
never
said
anything
negative
about
president
trump
chung
said
trump
welcomed
kim
s
remarks
in
a
trademark
tweet
kim
jong
un
of
north
korea
proclaims
unwavering
faith
in
president
thank
you
to
chairman
kim
we
will
get
it
done
together
trump
wrote
trump
had
previously
hailed
his
landmark
june
summit
with
kim
as
a
success
and
said
the
north
korean
nuclear
threat
was
over
despite
little
evidence
to
back
that
assertion
in
previous
failed
talks
north
korea
has
said
it
could
consider
giving
up
its
nuclear
programme
if
the
united
states
provided
security
guarantees
by
removing
troops
from
south
korea
and
withdrawing
its
nuclear
umbrella
of
deterrence
from
the
south
and
japan
officials
involved
in
the
latest
negotiations
have
said
north
korea
has
refused
to
even
start
discussions
about
defining
denuclearisation
and
has
insisted
the
united
states
must
first
agree
to
simultaneous
steps
to
reduce
sanctions
pressure
some
analysts
suggested
kim
was
flattering
trump
in
hopes
of
dividing
the
president
from
advisers
who
have
advocated
a
tougher
stand
kim
just
owns
trump
he
knows
his
mark
vipin
narang
a
political
scientist
at
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
who
specializes
in
nuclear
issues
said
in
a
message
on
twitter
pompeo
on
a
trip
to
new
delhi
said
there
was
still
an
enormous
amount
of
work
to
do
on
the
denuclearisation
issue
he
visited
pyongyang
in
july
after
which
north
korea
accused
him
of
making
unilateral
and
demands
for
denuclearisation
asked
about
intelligence
that
north
korea
was
still
advancing
its
weapons
programmes
pompeo
noted
pyongyang
had
ceased
its
nuclear
tests
and
missiles
which
he
said
was
a
good
but
the
work
of
convincing
chairman
kim
to
make
this
strategic
shift
that
we
ve
talked
about
for
a
brighter
future
for
the
people
of
north
korea
continues
pompeo
said
the
state
department
later
said
pompeo
was
sending
his
newly
appointed
north
korea
envoy
stephen
biegun
to
south
korea
china
and
japan
from
signalling
that
washington
s
concerns
extend
beyond
pyongyang
s
nuclear
programme
the
government
on
thursday
charged
and
sanctioned
an
alleged
north
korean
hacker
over
the
global
wannacry
ransomware
cyberattack
the
cyber
assault
on
sony
and
other
malign
cyber
chung
said
kim
had
stressed
the
need
for
the
united
states
to
reciprocate
north
korea
s
initial
moves
which
have
included
dismantling
a
nuclear
test
site
and
a
missile
engine
facility
we
support
progress
in
relations
and
president
moon
s
statements
that
such
progress
must
go
with
denuclearisation
a
spokesperson
for
the
white
house
national
security
council
nsc
said
when
asked
about
the
meeting
north
korea
s
official
kcna
news
agency
said
kim
told
the
south
s
envoys
that
his
fixed
stand
was
to
turn
the
korean
peninsula
into
a
cradle
of
peace
without
nuclear
weapons
free
from
nuclear
threat
chung
said
kim
showed
frustration
over
the
doubt
raised
by
some
parts
of
the
international
community
about
his
willingness
to
denuclearise
and
asked
us
to
convey
his
message
to
the
united
states
he
expressed
his
strong
will
to
carry
out
more
proactive
measures
towards
denuclearisation
if
action
is
taken
in
response
to
the
north
s
preemptive
steps
chung
said
koh
a
professor
of
north
korean
studies
at
dongguk
university
in
seoul
said
looks
like
kim
is
trying
to
wash
away
worries
that
talks
could
stall
or
fail
knowing
well
that
washington
is
losing
officials
have
previously
said
they
have
already
made
conciliatory
gestures
such
as
suspending
joint
military
exercises
with
south
korea
during
his
meeting
with
kim
chung
delivered
a
message
from
trump
and
will
relay
comments
from
kim
to
national
security
advisor
john
bolton
moon
s
spokesman
kim
told
reporters
chung
later
spoke
to
bolton
the
nsc
official
said
trump
spoke
to
moon
on
the
evening
before
chung
s
trip
and
asked
moon
to
act
as
chief
negotiator
between
washington
and
pyongyang
the
spokesman
said
however
a
summit
between
trump
kim
and
moon
an
idea
that
south
korea
has
floated
is
not
expected
on
the
sidelines
of
the
general
assembly
in
new
york
this
month
chung
said
suggesting
that
kim
is
not
likely
to
become
the
first
north
korean
leader
to
attend
the
gathering
antonio
guterres
praised
the
koreas
for
their
efforts
and
expressed
hope
for
further
progress
towards
complete
and
verifiable
denuclearisation
his
spokesman
said
kim
and
trump
held
an
unprecedented
summit
in
singapore
in
june
in
which
the
north
korean
leader
made
a
broad
vague
commitment
to
work
towards
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
but
negotiations
have
stalled
while
signs
north
korea
has
maintained
work
on
its
weapons
have
emerged
under
discussion
is
whether
north
korean
denuclearisation
or
declaring
an
end
to
the
korean
war
should
come
first
the
war
ended
with
an
armistice
not
a
peace
treaty
meaning
forces
are
technically
still
at
war
with
the
north
the
united
states
shouldn
t
delay
any
further
an
declaration
which
the
president
promised
at
the
singapore
summit
the
north
s
official
rodong
sinmun
newspaper
said
officials
have
said
such
a
declaration
could
weaken
north
korea
s
incentive
for
denuclearisation
and
create
uncertainty
about
the
purpose
of
troops
stationed
in
south
korea
