the
united
states
wants
a
strong
europe
and
is
willing

europe
must
be
fair
when
it
comes
to
sharing
the
defence
burden

trump
said
on

we
want
a
strong

it
s
very
important
to
us
and
whichever
way
we
can
do
it
the
best
and
more
efficient
would
be
something
we
both
want

has
been
largely
on

shared
trump
s
view
that
europe
needed
to
finance
a
greater
