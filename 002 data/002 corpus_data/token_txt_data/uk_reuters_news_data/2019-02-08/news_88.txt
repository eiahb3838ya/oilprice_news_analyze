placing
the
car

which
detonated
in
londonderry
in
a
statement
sent
to
the
derry
journal
on
tuesday
northern
irish
police
said
the
main
focus
of
the
investigation
was
on
the
new
ira
one
of
a
small
number
of
groups
opposed
to
a
peace
deal
that
largely
ended
three
decades
of
violence
in
the
province
we
also
caution
those
who
collaborate
with
the
british
that
they
are
to
desist
immediately
as
no
more
warnings
will
be
given

no
one
was
injured

the
peace
agreement
police
in
northern
ireland
and
european
union
member
ireland
have
said

a
return
to
a
hard
border
between

see
a
return
to
strife

group
denied
that
brexit
was
a
motivating
factor
for
their
actions
all
this
talk
of
brexit
hard
borders
soft
borders
has
no
bearing
on
our
actions
and
the
ira
won
t
be
going

fight
goes
on

ira
was
the
principal
nationalist
paramilitary
group
during
the
decades
of
violence
between
protestant
unionists
and
mainly
catholic
republicans
until
it
agreed
to
a
ceasefire
