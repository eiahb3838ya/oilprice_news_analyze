what the gunman didn't get - in squirrel hill, diversity made us strong
reuters
in
the
when
i
was
growing
up
in
pittsburgh
s
squirrel
hill
district
we
used
to
take
the
trolley
up
murray
avenue
heading
downtown
passing
through
a
tableau
of
jewish
life
there
were
silverman
s
and
rosenbloom
s
the
two
bakeries
where
we
bought
our
dark
rye
bread
there
were
kosher
butcher
shops
delicatessens
synagogues
and
a
hillel
academy
small
jewellery
shops
and
clothing
stores
back
then
the
synagogues
and
hebrew
schools
bore
signs
that
read
save
soviet
jewry
we
were
all
acutely
aware
that
pittsburgh
then
the
steel
capital
of
the
world
would
most
likely
be
hit
by
one
of
the
first
russian
nuclear
missiles
should
world
war
three
erupt
but
the
plight
of
soviet
jews
worried
my
neighbours
almost
as
much
it
was
no
surprise
the
soviet
jewry
movement
resonated
in
squirrel
hill
we
were
after
all
a
neighbourhood
of
refugees
though
most
of
us
didn
t
come
through
formal
programs
my
neighbours
families
had
fled
pogroms
in
eastern
europe
or
genocide
in
germany
or
in
my
family
s
case
poverty
in
ireland
we
understood
in
our
dna
the
need
to
seek
refuge
the
man
accused
of
slaughtering
people
at
the
tree
of
life
synagogue
in
squirrel
hill
on
saturday
robert
bowers
appears
from
social
media
postings
to
have
had
a
very
different
view
of
refugees
hours
before
saturday
s
attack
he
accused
one
prominent
refugee
group
the
hebrew
immigrant
aid
society
of
liking
to
bring
invaders
in
that
kill
our
social
media
postings
attributed
to
him
display
a
particular
animus
for
jews
the
minority
in
squirrel
hill
were
mainly
catholics
italian
and
irish
whose
parents
and
grandparents
were
also
immigrants
seeking
a
better
life
the
cultural
diversity
enriched
us
all
sometimes
literally
we
went
to
each
other
s
birthday
parties
bar
mitzvahs
and
confirmations
which
meant
more
envelopes
containing
money
at
the
end
of
the
night
almost
all
the
families
on
mt
royal
road
where
we
lived
were
jewish
we
had
the
great
fortune
to
live
across
the
street
from
the
sterns
whose
father
george
owned
the
manor
theatre
on
murray
avenue
we
saw
flubber
and
dalmatians
at
the
sterns
house
before
they
opened
in
theatres
down
the
street
were
the
alperns
who
had
a
men
s
store
the
family
gave
me
and
my
brothers
sport
coats
ties
and
slacks
much
better
than
the
stuff
we
used
to
get
at
claber
s
the
local
equivalent
of
those
days
the
friedman
s
next
door
were
very
close
family
friends
the
mother
sylvia
was
a
nurse
who
had
emigrated
from
south
africa
she
was
in
our
kitchen
every
day
after
school
having
tea
with
my
mother
her
daughter
linda
practically
raised
my
two
younger
sisters
we
never
felt
like
a
minority
in
predominantly
jewish
squirrel
hill
indeed
the
exotic
shops
the
men
in
black
hats
and
sidelocks
the
clanging
street
cars
provided
a
much
more
vibrant
american
lesson
in
multiculturalism
than
the
one
we
studied
in
civics
class
at
school
