brussels
reuters
the
european
union
and
britain
still
have
work
to
do
to
settle
a
range
of
issues
in
brexit
negotiations
including
avoiding
a
hard
border
in
ireland
the
eu
said
before
its
negotiator
michel
barnier
briefs
ministers
from
member
states
barnier
will
update
the
ministers
from
the
countries
that
will
remain
in
the
eu
on
progress
of
the
negotiations
on
tuesday
the
note
said
this
will
precede
an
eu
summit
in
the
austrian
city
of
salzburg
on
wednesday
and
thursday
some
parts
of
the
draft
withdrawal
agreement
have
already
been
agreed
in
principle
by
the
uk
and
the
eu
negotiators
although
nothing
is
agreed
until
everything
is
agreed
the
note
seen
by
reuters
said
there
are
still
parts
of
the
withdrawal
agreement
that
require
further
negotiation
one
of
them
is
the
issue
of
how
to
avoid
a
hard
border
between
ireland
and
northern
both
sides
are
keen
to
avoid
controls
on
the
border
between
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
and
the
irish
republic
which
will
become
the
only
land
frontier
between
the
uk
and
eu
after
brexit
day
six
months
from
now
however
agreement
on
a
practical
solution
has
remained
elusive
so
far
the
note
said
other
outstanding
issues
included
policing
of
the
deal
protecting
data
and
special
local
goods
an
agreement
on
a
future
relationship
can
only
be
negotiated
and
concluded
once
the
uk
has
become
a
third
country
however
an
overall
understanding
on
the
framework
for
the
future
relationship
will
be
set
out
in
a
political
declaration
accompanying
the
withdrawal
agreement
it
added
visiting
madrid
on
tuesday
barnier
said
separately
the
negotiations
were
continuing
in
spirit
of
good
cooperation
as
the
international
monetary
fund
warned
britain
s
economy
would
shrink
if
the
country
left
the
eu
without
a
brexit
deal
separately
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
defended
her
brexit
strategy
as
the
only
realistic
one
saying
the
country
otherwise
risked
the
most
bruising
brexit
