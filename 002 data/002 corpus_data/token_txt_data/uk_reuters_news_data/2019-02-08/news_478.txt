london murders back below new york levels, but set for highest rate in a decade
london
reuters
the
number
of
murders
in
london
has
fallen
below
that
of
new
york
city
but
could
still
hit
a
high
if
it
continues
at
the
current
pace
police
data
analysed
by
reuters
shows
provisional
figures
for
february
and
march
released
earlier
in
the
year
suggested
that
the
murder
rate
in
london
had
overtaken
new
york
for
the
first
time
in
modern
history
but
the
number
of
murders
in
new
york
so
far
this
year
is
now
double
the
number
in
london
according
to
figures
from
the
nypd
and
london
s
metropolitan
met
police
there
had
been
murders
in
london
to
october
this
year
compared
to
in
new
york
but
with
more
murders
in
london
in
november
the
total
for
the
year
stands
at
on
pace
to
reach
the
highest
number
since
when
there
were
it
s
difficult
for
us
to
be
even
slightly
positive
when
we
ve
got
the
murder
rate
that
we
have

green
ceo
of
the
ben
kinsella
trust
an
crime
charity
named
after
a
young
victim

london
and
new
york
are
similarly
sized
cities
but
there
is
less
gun
violence
in
britain
which
has
strict
gun
control
laws
than
in
the
united
states
and
most
british
police
are
not
equipped
with
firearms
but
the
rise
in
violent
crime
in
london
is
challenging
that
approach
the
met
denied
that
it
would
routinely
deploy
armed
officers
in
communities
affected
by
violence
after
media
reports
on
friday
but
did
say
armed
police
might
be
deployed
in
specific
instances
where
violence
had
happened
or
where
intelligence
suggested
it
could
happen
imminently
the
rise
is
driven
by
an
increase
in
knife
crime
so
far
this
year
percent
of
homicides
have
been
stabbings
while
only
percent
have
been
shootings
met
police
commander
david
musker
said
a
violent
crime
task
force
formed
earlier
this
year
had
arrested
more
than
people
in
the
last
eight
months
and
seized
more
than
knives
offensive
weapons
and
more
than
lethal
firearms
whilst
rates
in
london
are
now
beginning
to
stabilise
we
are
not
complacent
and
are
committed
to
using
all
the
powers
at
our
disposal
to
tackle
this
issue
he
said
while
members
of
parliament
in
westminster
obsess
over
brexit
the
rise
in
violent
crime
is
still
having
political
ramifications
during
an
election
campaign
last
year
prime
minister
theresa
may
was
criticised
for
her
record
as
home
secretary
where
she
presided
over
police
cuts
rather
than
bolstering
support
for
her
brexit
plan
through
the
vote
she
lost
her
parliamentary
majority
may
says
that
million
pounds
has
been
made
available
for
policing
this
year
london
mayor
sadiq
khan
has
highlighted
the
difficulties
caused
by
cuts
in
police
numbers
but
has
himself
faced
scrutiny
for
saying
that
london
remains
one
of
the
safest
global
cities
in
the
world
in
general
terms
khan
is
right
london
ranked
in
the
economist
intelligence
unit
s
safe
cities
index
above
paris
milan
and
moscow
and
last
year
had
a
lower
murder
rate
than
berlin
but
in
an
interview
with
bbc
radio
this
month
khan
said
it
could
take
a
generation
to
deal
with
the
increase
in
violent
crime
to
really
make
significant
progress
it
can
take
up
to
years
