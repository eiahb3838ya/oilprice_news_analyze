apple
farmers
across
the
northwest
fear
they
will
be
the
next
victims
of
a
trade
war
that
left
cherry
growers
in
the
same
region
with
weak
prices
and
having
to
scramble
for
alternative
buyers
because
of
prohibitive
chinese
tariffs
president
donald
trump
has
dealt
a
blow
to
farmers
this
year
with
trade
tactics
that
have
prompted
retaliation
from
key
markets
for
products
including
the
sweet
cherries
and
apples
that
speckle
landscapes
across
the
western
united
states
from
summer
through
autumn
we
d
like
this
to
be
settled
right
away
but
it
doesn
t
seem
like
it
will
be
so
we
re
just
holding
on
said
ray
norwood
director
of
sales
and
marketing
for
auvil
fruit
co
a
washington
grower
of
cherries
and
apples
the
apple
is
the
state
s
top
agricultural
crop
representing
some
billion
billion
pounds
to
billion
in
sales
each
year
according
to
the
washington
apple
commission
while
the
bulk
of
these
apples
are
consumed
domestically
about
percent
are
exported
and
are
vulnerable
to
tariffs
china
is
the
world
s
largest
producer
of
the
fruit
but
it
has
also
become
a
major
destination
for
varieties
like
red
delicious
and
gala
apples
according
to
industry
experts
cherry
producers
which
ship
about
a
third
of
their
fragile
and
highly
perishable
crop
overseas
saw
shipments
held
up
at
chinese
ports
and
ultimately
slapped
with
prohibitive
duties
in
the
harvest
which
ran
through
that
had
a
notable
impact
on
auvil
s
bottom
line
norwood
said
auvil
had
to
lower
prices
and
find
alternative
destinations
as
china
is
one
of
the
top
three
export
markets
for
about
percent
of
the
farm
s
cherry
sales
one
fruit
retailer
said
many
cherries
went
to
hong
kong
instead
of
mainland
china
prices
there
dropped
from
an
average
of
hk
us
per
pound
to
as
low
as
hk
per
pound
in
a
landmark
fruit
market
in
kowloon
s
yau
ma
tei
district
growers
of
apples
and
other
speciality
crops
are
worried
they
may
experience
the
same
fate
that
cherry
growers
and
shippers
already
faced
having
to
scramble
for
alternative
buyers
at
lower
prices
because
steep
duties
imposed
by
china
india
and
mexico
make
their
products
too
expensive
for
those
markets
the
governments
of
those
key
destinations
have
countered
trump
s
tariffs
with
hefty
levies
of
their
own
the
same
uncertainty
is
plaguing
growers
of
almonds
pistachios
pears
peaches
and
other
produce
and
crops
the
direct
impact
of
the
tariffs
on
fruit
vegetable
and
tree
nut
sales
is
expected
to
swell
to
more
than
billion
according
to
a
recent
study
conducted
by
university
of
california
davis
economists
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
unveiled
a
billion
aid
package
last
week
that
included
billion
for
the
purchase
of
apples
pears
pistachios
and
other
such
crops
but
farmers
said
it
likely
would
not
be
enough
dennis
nuxoll
vice
president
of
federal
affairs
for
the
western
growers
in
washington
dc
said
the
group
never
expected
department
of
agriculture
to
make
up
for
growers
losses
but
had
hoped
for
more
direct
assistance
the
group
said
in
a
statement
that
the
aid
program
will
fall
substantially
auvil
is
based
in
orondo
a
town
nestled
in
washington
state
home
to
about
percent
of
fresh
apple
production
apple
sellers
like
auvil
are
bracing
for
the
same
downturn
that
hit
cherries
just
as
orchards
ramp
up
harvesting
of
some
million
tonnes
i
don
t
know
just
how
much
it
ll
be
down
but
we
do
think
it
ll
be
drastic
said
rebecca
lyons
international
marketing
director
of
the
washington
apple
commission
in
wenatchee
washington
noting
effective
percent
levies
on
apples
in
china
mexico
india
and
china
which
are
expected
to
have
duties
in
place
during
the
shipping
season
represent
about
half
of
total
export
volumes
of
the
fruit
she
said
the
global
apple
market
is
very
competitive
even
if
the
tariffs
are
lifted
it
ll
be
harder
for
us
to
get
back
into
those
