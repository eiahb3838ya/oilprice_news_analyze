afghans shut out by polling station chaos return to vote
kabul

afghans
unable
to
vote
in
saturday
s
parliamentary
election
because
hundreds
of
polling
stations
failed
to
open
were
given
another
chance
to
cast
their
ballot
on
sunday
after
the
authorities
extended
voting
for
another
day
with
the
taliban
operating
freely
across
much
of
the
country
and
heavy
pressure
from
international
partners
for
the
vote
to
be
held
the
election
was
seen
as
a
major
test
of
the
credibility
of
the
government
around
three
million
afghans
voted
on
saturday
a
turnout
but
across
the
country
serious
technical
problems
were
reported
and
large
numbers
of
polling
stations
remained
closed
often
because
staff
failed
to
turn
up
turnout
was
above
expectations
and
we
should
appreciate
that
but
unfortunately
mismanagement
and
other
problems
with
the
commission
gave
us
the
worst
election
in
our
history
said
mohammad
arif
rahmani
a
member
in
the
last
parliament
saying
there
were
obvious
signs
of
fraud
this
extension
of
the
election
by
a
day
and
a
half
was
in
itself
clearly
something
that
opens
the
way
to
fraud
he
said
facing
a
swell
of
complaints
the
independent
election
commission
iec
announced
it
would
extend
voting
at
polling
stations
which
had
not
opened
until
sunday
despite
warnings
that
the
extended
opening
would
stretch
security
forces
it
is
not
an
ideal
scenario
one
international
security
official
said
in
the
event
fewer
than
two
thirds
of
the
polling
stations
meant
to
open
on
sunday
actually
did
so
with
the
remainder
closed
for
security
reasons
iec
chairman
abdul
bade
sayad
said
preparations
for
the
election
had
been
marred
by
organizational
problems
accusations
of
cheating
and
the
threat
of
violence
from
taliban
militants
more
than
attacks
involving
grenades
or
improvised
explosive
devices
were
reported
on
saturday
and
dozens
of
people
were
killed
and
wounded
across
the
country
on
saturday
in
kabul
people
were
killed
in
one
suicide
attack
many
independent
election
observers
were
reluctant
to
work
fearing
militant
attacks
but
the
threat
came
from
other
groups
as
well
as
the
taliban
armed
men
loyal
to
local
power
brokers
in
some
provinces
entered
polling
stations
by
force
and
broke
election
materials
and
on
sunday
the
bodies
of
four
observers
were
found
in
the
northern
province
of
balkh
after
they
had
been
abducted
a
day
earlier
and
shot
ballot
counting
has
begun
but
preliminary
results
of
the
election
are
not
expected
to
be
announced
until
next
month
the
parliamentary
vote
was
seen
as
a
dry
run
for
next
year
s
more
important
presidential
election
which
afghanistan
s
international
partners
are
desperately
hoping
will
avoid
the
bitterness
and
cheating
that
tainted
the
last
election
in
more
than
a
million
people
voted
in
the
capital
kabul
but
turnout
was
very
low
in
the
provinces
said
naeem
ayubzada
director
of
transparent
election
foundation
of
afghanistan
a
civic
action
body
that
has
been
monitoring
the
ballot
he
also
said
the
decision
to
extend
the
vote
opened
the
way
for
abuse
with
ballot
boxes
left
open
all
night
in
some
polling
centres
from
a
planning
point
of
view
it
s
very
difficult
he
said
it
provides
an
opportunity
for
mariam
sulaimankhel
a
candidate
for
the
nomadic
kochi
minority
who
have
reserved
seats
said
that
along
with
many
kochis
in
kabul
she
had
been
unable
to
vote
because
officials
did
not
have
the
lists
with
their
names
we
are
a
minority
and
the
election
commission
does
not
care
about
fair
representation
she
said
in
addition
voting
in
the
province
of
kandahar
was
delayed
by
a
week
following
the
assassination
of
the
powerful
local
police
commander
abdul
razeq
the
election
in
the
central
province
of
ghazni
was
also
postponed
due
to
disagreements
over
the
representation
of
different
ethnic
groups
