the
european
commission
said
on
tuesday
it
intended
to
adopt
by
the
end
of
december
all
the
legislation
necessary
to
prepare
the
eu
for
a
british
exit
without
a
divorce
agreement
should
it
be
necessary
by
brexit
day
on
march
the
eu
executive
is
in
charge
of
negotiating
a
departure
agreement
with
britain
on
behalf
of
the
countries
remaining
in
the
eu
after
britain
leaves
as
britain
s
exit
date
comes
closer
and
negotiations
on
the
withdrawal
treaty
have
not
yet
been
completed
the
commission
issued
a
document
on
tuesday
on
the
preparations
the
eu
would
have
to
take
in
case
a
divorce
agreement
could
not
be
reached
the
draft
withdrawal
agreement
constitutes
the
best
option
for
the
withdrawal
in
the
absence
of
a
withdrawal
agreement
the
european
union
will
act
to
protect
its
interests
and
should
display
a
united
and
coordinated
approach
in
all
areas
the
commission
said
in
london
the
bbc
said
the
eu
and
britain
had
agreed
a
draft
brexit
divorce
deal
text
and
prime
minister
theresa
may
would
present
the
agreement
to
her
senior
ministers
on
wednesday
any
deal
has
to
be
approved
by
parliament
the
commission
said
it
intended
to
propose
all
necessary
legislative
measures
and
adopt
all
the
legal
acts
required
for
preparing
the
eu
for
britain
crashing
out
without
a
divorce
deal
before
dec
it
said
this
deadline
would
give
the
european
parliament
and
eu
governments
the
time
needed
to
complete
the
procedures
in
time
for
brexit
day
the
commission
said
the
time
needed
for
these
procedure
could
not
be
contracted
because
eu
treaties
provided
for
an
period
for
the
consultation
of
national
parliaments
while
some
legal
acts
were
subject
to
mandatory
scrutiny
by
the
european
parliament
and
governments
it
said
the
risks
of
financial
instability
in
the
event
of
a
brexit
have
diminished
significantly
due
to
ongoing
contingency
preparations
though
such
a
scenario
could
still
pose
risks
for
cleared
derivatives
announcing
its
latest
contingency
plans
for
a
brexit
the
eu
s
executive
said
it
was
looking
at
temporary
bridging
solutions
to
mitigate
disruption
in
key
areas
on
air
traffic
the
commission
said
it
would
propose
extending
current
rules
to
allow
uk
airlines
to
land
in
eu
territory
and
take
off
from
its
airports
but
that
this
was
conditional
on
britain
applying
equivalent
measures
for
carriers
from
the
bloc
for
road
transport
however
the
commission
said
its
unilateral
contingency
measures
would
allow
for
considerably
less
traffic
than
what
currently
takes
place
between
the
union
and
the
united
kingdom
