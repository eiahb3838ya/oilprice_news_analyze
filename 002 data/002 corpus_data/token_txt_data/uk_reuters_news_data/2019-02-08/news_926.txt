'don't bully us', britain takes new combative tone to brexit talks
birmingham
england
reuters
britain
can
not
be
bullied
brexit
minister
dominic
raab
said
on
monday
sharpening
the
government
s
criticism
of
the
european
union
for
taunting
prime
minister
theresa
may
and
souring
difficult
brexit
talks
may
s
ministers
have
come
out
one
by
one
at
their
party
s
annual
conference
in
the
city
of
birmingham
to
warn
the
eu
that
they
will
embrace
leaving
without
a
deal
if
the
bloc
fails
to
show
respect
in
the
talks
to
end
britain
s
membership
just
six
months
before
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
eu
in
the
country
s
biggest
shift
in
foreign
and
trade
policy
in
more
than
years
may
faces
growing
criticism
over
her
proposals
not
only
in
her
governing
party
but
also
in
brussels
party
unity
is
on
british
ministers
minds
and
they
are
encouraging
the
faithful
to
direct
their
anger
at
the
eu
rather
than
at
their
prime
minister
who
some
eurosceptic
conservatives
accuse
of
leading
britain
towards
a
brexit
in
name
only
but
the
new
strident
tone
has
annoyed
many
in
brussels
especially
when
foreign
minister
jeremy
hunt
compared
the
bloc
to
the
soviet
union
the
master
of
several
states
in
eastern
europe
which
saw
membership
of
the
eu
as
a
measure
of
their
freedom
other
ministers
such
as
finance
minister
philip
hammond
have
taken
a
softer
tone
pointing
out
that
leaving
without
a
deal
could
hurt
britain
s
economy
the
world
s
fifth
largest
but
raab
said
he
had
called
on
the
eu
to
match
the
ambition
and
pragmatism
britain
had
put
forward
with
may
s
chequers
proposals
named
after
her
country
residence
where
an
agreement
with
her
ministers
was
hashed
out
in
july
unfortunately
that
wasn
t
on
display
in
salzburg
he
said
describing
a
summit
last
month
in
the
austrian
city
where
eu
leaders
rejected
parts
of
the
chequers
plan
our
prime
minister
has
been
constructive
and
respectful
in
return
we
heard
jibes
from
senior
leaders
and
we
saw
a
starkly
approach
to
what
is
unthinkable
is
that
this
government
or
any
british
government
could
be
bullied
by
the
threat
of
some
kind
of
economic
embargo
into
signing
a
deal
against
our
country
s
interests
raab
said
later
calling
again
on
the
eu
to
move
their
position
and
meet
britain
half
way
instead
of
the
staging
post
the
salzburg
summit
has
become
a
byword
for
a
sharp
deterioration
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
talks
when
british
government
officials
felt
may
was
ambushed
by
the
other
eu
leaders
over
brexit
a
tweet
by
european
council
president
donald
tusk
showing
him
offering
may
a
selection
of
cakes
with
the
comment
a
piece
of
cake
perhaps
sorry
no
cherries
certainly
had
an
impact
one
official
said
with
no
divorce
deal
and
a
standoff
over
the
shape
of
any
future
relationship
the
possibility
of
a
no
deal
brexit
has
increased
with
some
businesses
preparing
for
what
they
see
as
a
worst
case
scenario
european
commission
president
juncker
said
the
discussion
in
britain
over
brexit
was
still
far
removed
from
reality
the
world
is
watching
said
matthew
fell
chief
uk
policy
director
at
the
confederation
of
british
industry
every
signal
is
hugely
important
in
terms
of
setting
the
tone
so
the
more
that
people
can
coalesce
around
some
areas
of
agreement
such
as
an
industrial
strategy
innovation
and
skills
would
be
hugely
helpful
he
told
reuters
but
one
source
close
to
the
government
said
there
was
now
a
sense
that
the
eu
had
realised
that
the
tone
set
in
salzburg
was
perhaps
a
bit
off
and
behind
the
scenes
conversations
between
the
two
sides
were
more
constructive
raab
later
said
the
government
was
open
to
looking
at
regulatory
checks
to
try
to
ease
talks
on
a
backstop
to
prevent
a
return
to
a
hard
border
between
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
and
eu
member
ireland
one
of
the
outstanding
issues
yet
to
be
agreed
hammond
for
one
was
keen
to
pursue
a
more
positive
stance
after
brexit
britain
and
the
eu
will
still
be
neighbours
and
we
are
going
to
have
to
carry
on
living
with
each
other
he
told
the
conference
again
backing
may
s
chequers
plan
mr
tusk
says
it
won
t
work
but
that
s
what
people
said
about
the
light
bulb
in
our
job
is
to
prove
him
but
hunt
s
popular
line
at
conference
that
the
eu
was
acting
like
the
soviet
union
did
little
to
soothe
relations
provoking
those
eastern
members
of
the
bloc
which
only
regained
full
independence
after
the
collapse
of
the
soviet
union
in
they
joined
the
eu
more
than
a
decade
later
lithuania
s
eu
commissioner
vytenis
andriukaitis
told
hunt
he
was
born
in
a
soviet
gulag
forced
labour
camp
and
was
jailed
by
the
soviet
kgb
state
security
agency
happy
to
brief
you
on
the
main
differences
between
eu
and
soviet
union
he
said
anytime
whatever
but
back
in
birmingham
it
was
raab
winning
a
standing
ovation
for
his
story
about
his
father
s
journey
from
then
czechoslovakia
after
the
nazi
invasion
who
summed
up
britain
s
new
combative
stance
the
eu
s
theological
approach
allows
no
room
for
serious
compromise
he
said
if
the
eu
want
a
deal
they
need
to
get
