plantation
reuters
long
before
cesar
sayoc
was
arrested
on
friday
for
allegedly
sending
pipe
bombs
to
critics
of
president
donald
trump
the
former
stripper
with
a
long
arrest
record
threatened
to
bomb
a
power
company
and
posted
angry
rants
he
was
like
a
in
an
adult
s
body
and
the
kind
of
arrests
he
had
were
reflective
of
that
ron
lowy
his
former
attorney
and
now
lawyer
for
sayoc
s
family
told
cnn
in
an
interview
on
friday
sayoc
was
arrested
friday
morning
in
plantation
at
a
car
parts
store
and
charged
with
sending
package
bombs
to
former
president
barack
obama
former
secretary
of
state
hillary
clinton
and
other
public
figures
trump
has
frequently
hours
after
federal
authorities
arrested
him
in
plantation
florida
his
social
media
posts
and
extraordinary
work
history
began
to
offer
the
first
sketch
of
a
man
whose
rudimentary
bombs
launched
a
nationwide
manhunt
sayoc
has
worked
as
a
male
stripper
a
professional
wrestler
a
store
manager
and
a
club
promoter
according
to
public
records
social
media
profiles
and
interviews
with
people
who
interacted
with
him
his
white
van
which
authorities
seized
had
numerous
signs
in
the
windows
including
a
drawing
depicting
the
president
standing
on
top
of
a
tank
emblazoned
with
the
van
also
had
photos
of
clinton
and
other
democrats
with
bulls
eyes
superimposed
on
their
faces
it
was
not
immediately
clear
where
sayoc
has
been
living
or
working
most
recently
david
cypkin
a
documentary
filmmaker
recalled
seeing
the
van
parked
outside
a
shopping
center
near
his
home
for
more
than
a
year
and
as
recently
as
this
summer
it
often
had
an
open
door
or
an
open
window
which
led
me
to
believe
there
was
somebody
inside
cypkin
said
in
a
phone
interview
it
stayed
overnight
i
saw
it
dozens
of
sayoc
s
social
media
accounts
are
filled
with
sentiments
and
racist
diatribes
but
lowy
his
lawyer
back
in
said
his
political
awakening
seemed
to
be
recent
records
show
he
was
a
registered
republican
his
mother
confirmed
to
me
he
had
never
voted
he
never
had
an
interest
in
any
type
of
political
issues
his
interest
was
more
body
building
nightclub
according
to
bankruptcy
records
in
he
had
been
living
with
his
mother
with
no
furniture
then
lowy
said
sayoc
may
have
been
attracted
to
trump
s
appeal
to
outsiders
people
who
don
t
fit
in
people
who
are
angry
at
america
telling
them
that
they
have
a
place
at
the
table
telling
them
that
it
s
ok
to
get
lowy
became
sayoc
s
lawyer
when
he
was
charged
in
with
threatening
to
bomb
a
power
utility
for
trying
to
shut
off
the
lights
of
a
laundromat
he
owned
at
the
time
telling
a
company
representative
it
would
be
worse
than
september
according
to
a
miami
police
report
over
the
years
he
was
arrested
for
domestic
violence
theft
and
fraud
while
sayoc
in
his
social
media
posts
appears
to
identify
with
the
seminole
nation
lowy
said
his
father
was
from
the
philippines
who
left
the
family
when
the
boy
was
young
and
his
mother
was
of
italian
ancestry
from
brooklyn
and
he
adopted
this
claim
to
being
a
seminole
because
he
was
trying
to
create
an
identity
lowy
said
in
sayoc
reported
that
worth
of
donald
clothing
was
stolen
from
his
car
while
he
worked
out
at
a
gym
along
with
a
laptop
and
other
items
according
to
broward
county
sheriff
s
office
records
there
was
not
enough
evidence
to
identify
a
suspect
according
to
the
records
he
delivered
pizzas
at
the
new
river
pizza
fresh
kitchen
in
fort
lauderdale
working
only
nights
because
of
the
politically
charged
images
on
his
van
said
his
former
boss
debra
gureghian
who
described
herself
as
a
proud
lesbian
when
sayoc
learnt
that
gureghian
was
a
lesbian
he
told
her
if
he
had
control
i
would
be
on
an
island
with
the
blacks
the
jews
the
gays
the
lesbians
the
transgenders
and
that
he
would
nuke
the
island
she
said
he
was
otherwise
a
fabulous
worker
gureghian
said
on
time
diligent
articulate
never
had
any
complaints
with
any
customers
i
wish
i
had
more
of
federal
officials
said
on
friday
they
were
unsure
of
the
motive
behind
his
rudimentary
package
bombs

he
made
no
secret
of
his
political
grievances
