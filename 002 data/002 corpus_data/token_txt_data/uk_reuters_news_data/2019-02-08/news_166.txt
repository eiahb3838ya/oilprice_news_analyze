popcorn to hand, eu watches brexit show but frets for own future
reuters
eu
brexit
negotiators
are
watching
the
bbc
and
eating
popcorn
in
the
words
of
one
of
them
as
britain
s
domestic
rows
over
leaving
make
for
compelling
tv
but
frustrate
europe
s
hopes
for
a
clean
break
unsure
whether
britain
will
crash
out
of
the
european
union
weeks
from
now
prolong
the
agony
in
the
hope
of
salvaging
an
orderly
divorce
or
even
change
its
mind
and
stay
its
neighbours
are
torn
between
brexit
boredom
and
a
worry
it
is
distracting
from
their
own
pressing
problems
as
campaigning
gets
under
way
for
eu
parliament
elections
in
may
hours
after
a
packed
and
rowdy
house
of
commons
tore
up
the
deal
prime
minister
theresa
may
spent
two
tortuous
years
arguing
over
only
a
few
dozen
of
their
counterparts
in
strasbourg
showed
up
on
wednesday
to
hear
eu
negotiator
michel
barnier
tell
them
all
he
could
do
is
wait
for
britons
to
make
up
their
minds
several
in
the
debate
praised
britain
s
democratic
history
and
were
bemused
by
its
poisonous
meltdown
over
brexit
among
them
was
dutch
conservative
esther
de
lange
collectively
they
don
t
know
what
they
want
she
said
of
watching
the
commons
in
action
but
boy
do
they
hold
great
speeches
about
compared
to
a
full
house
to
mark
the
anniversary
of
the
euro
the
eu
currency
britain
snubbed
the
hundreds
of
empty
seats
around
her
were
a
mark
of
europe
s
weariness
with
brexit
but
it
also
belied
anxiety
that
paralysis
in
london
will
distract
and
divide
leaders
on
other
eu
problems
from
a
slowing
economy
amid
global
trade
disputes
to
deep
divisions
over
money
migrants
and
by
many
members
french
president
emmanuel
macron
says
he
does
not
want
to
waste
time
on
brexit
as
he
presses
to
reshape
the
euro
zone
and
the
broader
union
after
the
european
elections
in
four
months
time
his
eu
affairs
minister
nathalie
loiseau
said
brexit
took
up
a
third
of
her
time
it
s
too
much
she
said
because
we
have
many
other
things
to
do
in
europe
than
dealing
with
a
manfred
weber
an
ally
of
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
who
is
leading
the
campaign
said
that
europe
s
door
is
still
open
should
britain
decide
to
stay
but
he
told
reuters
it
is
now
time
to
move
on
and
get
brexit
over
weber
complained
that
a
brexit
process
had
taken
huge
amounts
of
time
money
and
expertise
from
the
eu
it
has
consumed
valuable
political
energy
especially
in
this
election
year
he
said
and
has
held
us
back
from
shaping
a
real
positive
european
agenda
for
the
nearly
three
years
after
britain
s
shock
referendum
vote
to
leave
put
supporters
of
european
integration
on
the
back
foot
a
push
to
regain
momentum
lies
behind
a
summit
of
the
remaining
leaders
to
be
held
in
the
romanian
town
of
sibiu
on
may
it
was
intended
by
eu
chief
executive
juncker
to
focus
minds
on
a
future
without
one
of
europe
s
three
biggest
economies
and
two
nuclear
military
powers
and
be
the
culmination
of
efforts
to
end
divisions
threatening
eu
cohesion
during
last
month
s
eu
summit
which
they
hoped
would
be
the
last
on
brexit
leaders
were
visibly
weary
of
it
the
fatigue
was
palpable
said
one
diplomat
in
the
room
they
don
t
want
to
be
bothered
with
it
they
want
to
get
it
over
if
there
has
been
a
positive
from
brexit
leaders
say
it
has
been
the
exceptional
unity
the
have
shown
in
negotiation
though
a
scary
could
yet
test
that
togetherness
many
also
believe
turmoil
in
britain
has
dampened
appetites
to
follow
suit
with
european
voters
warming
to
the
union
and
eurosceptic
governments
such
as
in
italy
hungary
and
poland
stressing
their
criticisms
of
the
eu
do
not
presage
an
exit
yet
sibiu
and
the
eu
elections
on
may
are
set
to
expose
continuing
schisms
on
how
to
move
the
union
forward
founders
france
and
germany
disagree
over
tightening
monetary
union
as
do
italy
and
its
northern
neighbours
over
sharing
out
migrants
arriving
by
sea
rich
contributor
states
and
the
east
are
split
over
filling
a
hole
in
the
eu
budget
and
over
some
eastern
governments
manoeuvring
to
stifle
their
opponents
on
brexit
the
eu
has
shown
exceptional
unity
if
only
we
could
show
the
same
kind
of
unity
on
everything
else
lamented
one
diplomat
involved
in
preparing
the
summit
one
result
of
may
s
troubles
could
be
that
britain
is
still
a
member
come
sibiu
and
the
eu
elections
a
new
headache
that
makes
some
wary
of
extending
the
brexit
deadline
few
however
seem
willing
to
force
britain
out
against
its
will
yet
prolonging
the
process
though
is
bad
news
said
an
envoy
to
brussels
from
a
country
leaders
have
tried
to
drive
it
down
their
list
of
priorities
and
the
negotiations
in
barnier
s
task
force
but
brexit
sits
around
like
a
bad
penny
he
said
you
can
t
ignore
it
it
s
in
your
face
and
will
continue
to
be
in
your
face
until
