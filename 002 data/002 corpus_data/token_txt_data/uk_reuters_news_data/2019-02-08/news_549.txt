reuters
nissan
wants
more
influence
in
its
alliance
with
france
s
renault
following
the
arrest
of
group
chairman
carlos
ghosn
arguing
the
structure
does
not
adequately
reflect
the
japanese
carmaker
s
size
and
global
sales
japan
s
auto
manufacturer
has
long
felt
like
the
junior
partner
in
the
alliance
built
by
ghosn
over
the
last
years
since
he
rescued
nissan
from
the
alliance
was
extended
to
include
mitsubishi
motors
in
but
while
nissan
is
agitating
for
change
the
french
and
japanese
governments
talked
up
stability
on
wednesday
saying
they
wanted
to
consolidate
the
alliance
following
ghosn
s
shock
arrest
on
suspicion
of
financial
misaccounting
nissan
has
said
it
will
fire
ghosn
as
chairman
on
thursday
we
need
to
return
to
the
original
idea
of
a
relationship
a
nissan
executive
told
reporters
at
a
briefing
in
tokyo
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
it
should
be
a
more
equal
relationship
than
nissan
while
almost
percent
bigger
than
renault
by
sales
remains
junior
in
their
shareholding
structure
while
renault
holds
percent
of
nissan
nissan
has
just
a
stake
in
renault
renault
s
biggest
shareholder
is
the
french
state
with
percent
the
nissan
executive
said
a
reduction
of
renault
s
stake
in
nissan
should
be
one
option
under
consideration
ghosn
a
brazilian
lebanese
and
french
citizen
had
personally
shaped
the
alliance
and
pledged
to
consolidate
it
with
a
deeper
one
that
not
all
parties
were
convinced
by
before
his
arrest
the
was
exploring
a
full
merger
at
the
french
government
s
urging
we
d
asked
carlos
ghosn
to
reinforce
the
alliance
a
french
official
told
reuters
adding
that
the
government
was
still
in
the
dark
about
the
case
against
him
it
s
difficult
to
see
what
s
behind
all
this
whether
it
s
all
true
or
whether
it
s
been
swiftly
brought
out
to
scupper
the
alliance
or
take
auto
analyst
thomas
besson
of
paris
brokerage
kepler
was
less
equivocal
nissan
s
planned
dismissal
of
its
chairman
appears
to
be
an
indirect
way
of
formally
refusing
a
financial
merger
that
ghosn
was
advocating
he
said
as
well
as
geography
and
culture
the
ties
among
the
companies
are
complicated
by
the
role
of
the
french
state
which
enjoys
rights
in
renault
in
japan
there
is
concern
france
is
ultimately
seeking
to
take
control
of
nissan
and
mitsubishi
in
france
there
are
suspicions
ghosn
may
have
been
targeted
so
as
to
hinder
french
influence
trust
has
been
undermined
on
both
sides
there
is
a
feeling
of
crisis
at
the
ministry
of
economy
trade
and
industry
that
at
this
rate
nissan
and
mitsubishi
will
be
seized
by
the
french
government
said
a
senior
source
familiar
with
japanese
government
thinking
french
finance
minister
bruno
le
maire
sought
to
ease
the
tensions
saying
stability
remained
critical
for
both
france
and
japan
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
the
evidence
against
ghosn
before
reaching
conclusions
and
added
that
he
would
meet
japan
s
economy
and
industry
minister
on
thursday
for
talks
at
this
stage
we
do
not
have
any
evidence
to
support
the
accusations
against
mr
carlos
ghosn
le
maire
told
reporters
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
renault
board
s
request
that
nissan
share
all
the
evidence
available
to
renault
on
tuesday
tapped
its
chief
operating
officer
and
a
senior
board
member
to
fill
in
for
ghosn
but
the
board
refrained
from
ousting
him
while
waiting
for
details
on
the
allegations
a
decision
that
could
buy
more
time
for
an
accelerated
permanent
succession
process
one
of
the
world
s
auto
industry
executives
ghosn
bestrode
the
alliance
although
he
often
said
that
his
efforts
to
drive
integration
were
hampered
by
the
french
government
s
stake
in
renault
on
monday
nissan
ceo
hiroto
saikawa
portrayed
nissan
as
a
victim
of

were
weighing
bringing
a
case
against
the
japanese

gone
from

the
future
of
the
alliance
is
the
subject
of
intense
investor

it
may
be
hard
to
manage

the
success
of
the

which
helps
the

products
and
control

is
critical
for

changes

tastes
