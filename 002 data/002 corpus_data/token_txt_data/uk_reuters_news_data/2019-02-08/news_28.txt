stray cows add to modi's farmer woes as indian election looms

as
night
fell
on
the
bucolic
northern
indian
hamlet
of
mahaban
gopi
chand
yadav
gathered
blankets
and
a
flashlight
to
spend
the
night
sitting
on
a
wooden
platform
in
his
field
his
task
to
use
bamboo
sticks
to
ward
off
stray
cattle
from
intruding
and
eating
a
maturing
mustard
crop
like
yadav
many
thousands
of
farmers
stay
awake
to
guard
their
farms
over
a
cold
winter
or
face
losing
their
crops
to
the
cattle
a
double
whammy
for
growers
already
reeling
from
a
plunge
in
indian
crop
prices
while
stray
cows
ambling
around
towns
and
villages
have
always
been
a
feature
of
life
in
rural
india
farmers
say
their
number
has
increased
sharply
in
recent
years
to
the
extent
that
they
have
become
a
menace
and
blame
the
policies
of
prime
minister
narendra
modi
s
hindu
nationalist
government
protecting
cows
considered
sacred
to
hindus
was
one
of
the
measures
meant
to
shore
up
support
in
the
heavily
populated
belt
across
northern
india
that
has
been
a
heartland
of
the
ruling
bharatiya
janata
party
s
bjp
instead
it
is
creating
a
backlash
even
among
hindu
farmers
we
already
had
enough
problems
and
now
the
government
has
created
one
more
said
octogenarian
farmer
baburao
saini
from
kakripur
village
about
kilometres
miles
from
new
delhi
for
the
first
time
we
ve
been
forced
to
stay
in
the
fields
to
protect
our
more
than
farmers
reuters
spoke
to
in
mahaban
and
nine
other
villages
in
uttar
pradesh
state
said
they
would
think
twice
before
voting
for
modi
s
bjp
in
the
next
general
election
due
by
may
the
cattle
issue
and
low
farm
prices
are
major
reasons
behind
their
disillusionment
with
a
party
that
most
say
they
voted
for
in
the
last
election
in
modi
swept
uttar
pradesh
at
that
poll
winning
of
seats
in
india
s
most
populous
state
with
rural
voters
swayed
by
a
promise
of
higher
crop
prices
and
as
hindu
farmers
supported
the
bjp
amid
tensions
with
the
minority
muslim
community
modi
is
trying
hard
to
claw
back
support
among
india
s
million
farmers
and
their
many
millions
of
dependents
after
the
bjp
lost
power
in
december
to
the
opposition
congress
in
three
big
northern
states
where
agriculture
is
a
mainstay
indian
farmers
keep
cows
to
produce
milk
cheese
and
butter
but
to
harm
or
kill
a
cow
especially
for
food
is
considered
taboo
by
most
hindus
most
states
in
india
have
long
outlawed
cow
slaughter
but
after
coming
to
power
in
the
bjp
ratcheted
up
its
distaste
for
trade
in
cattle
launching
a
crackdown
on
unlicensed
abattoirs
in
uttar
pradesh
and
on
cattle
smuggling
nationwide
at
the
same
time
a
wave
of
attacks
on
trucks
carrying
cattle
by
hindu
vigilante
groups
has
scared
away
traders
most
of
whom
are
muslims
bringing
to
a
halt
the
trade
even
in
bullocks
which
are
not
considered
sacred
rising
sales
of
tractors
and
increasing
mechanisation
mean
that
more
animals
are
redundant
for
use
in
farming
the
farmers
reuters
spoke
to
said
they
revered
cows
as
most
devout
hindus
would
but
a
sudden
halt
in
the
trade
of
cattle
had
hit
the
rural
economy
in
their
view
the
government
should
come
up
with
more
cow
shelters
and
let
cattle
traders
deal
in
other
animals
without
fear
of
attack
the
government
has
only
enforced
the
laws
by
closing
down
unlicensed
abattoirs
and
cracking
down
on
cattle
smuggling
said
bjp
spokesman
gopal
krishna
agarwal
who
added
that
he
runs
a
cow
shelter
of
cattle
we
re
not
trying
to
hurt
either
any
community
or
the
rural
fodder
prices
have
gone
up
by
more
than
a
third
in
the
past
year
and
most
farmers
can
not
afford
to
keep
cows
after
they
stop
producing
milk
said
farmer
rajesh
pahalwan
as
he
smoked
a
hookah
pipe
in
the
village
of
manoharpur
six
farmers
sitting
with
him
mainly
nodded
in
agreement
in
india
the
world
s
biggest
milk
producer
about
million
cattle
become
unproductive
every
year
in
the
past
hindu
farmers
would
sell
unproductive
cows
to
muslim
traders
and
about
million
of
these
would
end
up
smuggled
to
bangladesh
for
meat
and
leather
but
that
trade
has
now
been
throttled
by
the
government
crackdown
trade
and
industry
officials
say
that
has
led
to
many
unproductive
cattle
being
abandoned
farmers
said
but
governments
both
state
and
federal
have
failed
to
construct
new
shelters
leaving
rising
numbers
of
stray
cattle
that
are
feeding
on
crops
or
even
garbage
the
government
clearly
did
not
think
of
alternatives
before
putting
these
curbs
in
place
said
farmer
deepak
chaudhary
who
grows
wheat
on
the
outskirts
of
mathura
considered
to
be
the
birthplace
of
the
hindu
god
krishna
as
hindus
we
treat
cows
as
sacred
but
these
unwarranted
measures
have
upended
the
economics
of
the
government
did
provide
some
relief
in
its
interim
budget
last
week
as
it
announced
a
cow
welfare
programme
costing
billion
rupees
million
pounds
in
the
year
beginning
april
but
there
are
hardly
any
adequate
measures
to
rehabilitate
cattle
said
fauzan
alvi
of
the
all
india
meat
and
livestock
exporters
association
forget
about
cows
we
can
not
sell
even
a
single
animal
to
even
our
relatives
thanks
to
cow
vigilante
groups
which
are
aided
and
abetted
by
the
bjp
said
the
wheat
farmer
chaudhary
modi
has
in
the
past
condemned
violence
by
cow
vigilantes
but
critics
and
opposition
politicians
say
some
of
the
hindu
groups
involved
have
links
to
his
party
a
charge
the
bjp
denies
nearly
percent
of
india
s
farmers
own
less
than
hectares
acres
of
land
so
even
a
relatively
small
area
damaged
has
a
big
impact
on
their
livelihood
only
two
weeks
ago
some
cattle
ravaged
an
acre
of
wheat
grown
by
farmer
chandra
pal
in
the
mathura
district
of
uttar
pradesh
my
investment
went
down
the
drain
after
some
stray
cattle
trampled
and
ate
up
the
crop
he
said
many
farmers
in
uttar
pradesh
are
now
using
barbed
wire
to
stop
animals
from
entering
their
farms
but
that
is
expensive
we
have
been
at
the
receiving
end
of
policies
of
the
government
and
the
problem
of
stray
cattle
is
just
another
blow
to
us
said
farmer
amar
chand
from
maholi
village
who
voted
for
modi
in
unlike
the
previous
general
election
farmers
are
not
solidly
behind
modi
who
s
on
shaky
ground

time
