washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
said
on
thursday
his
administration
planned
to
require
immigrants
seeking
asylum
in
the
united
states
to
come
into
the
country
through
a
legal
port
of
entry
pushing
a
hard
line
on
immigration
ahead
of
elections
next
week
the
president
s
remarks
five
days
before
voters
determine
which
party
will
control
congress
and
state
governorships
across
the
country
drew
immediate
criticism
as
an
effort
to
generate
fear
and
energise
his
political
base
migrants
seeking
asylum
will
have
to
present
themselves
lawfully
at
a
port
of
entry
trump
told
reporters
at
the
white
house
painting
a
caravan
of
migrants
travelling
from
central
america
toward
the
united
states
as
a
dangerous
threat
those
who
choose
to
break
our
laws
and
enter
illegally
will
no
longer
be
able
to
use
meritless
claims
to
gain
automatic
admission
into
our
country
he
said
it
was
not
clear
whether
the
plan
would
pass
legal
muster
although
trump
who
sought
to
use
immigration
as
an
issue
to
motivate
republican
voters
in
the
presidential
race
and
now
ahead
of
the
elections
said
it
would
he
added
that
an
executive
order
was
in
the
process
of
being
finalised
but
provided
few
details
federal
law
provides
that
any
immigrant
in
the
united
states
may
apply
for
asylum
regardless
of
whether
he
or
she
enters
the
country
through
a
designated
port
of
entry
trump
has
ramped
up
his
tough
stance
on
illegal
immigration
in
recent
days
he
deemed
the
group
of
migrants
from
central
america
a
threat
to
americans
it
is
made
up
of
people
who
have
left
poverty
and
violence
at
home
and
are
heading
slowly
through
mexico
toward
the
border
trump
referred
to
the
movement
as
an
mexico
on
wednesday
put
the
size
of
the
caravan
that
left
honduras
in
at
to
people
other
caravans
have
since
followed
the
president
who
has
ordered
troops
to
the
border
with
mexico
also
suggested
by
migrants
would
be
treated
as
equivalent
to
gun
usage
they
want
to
throw
rocks
at
our
military
our
military
fights
back
we
re
going
to
consider
and
i
told
them
to
consider
it
a
rifle
when
they
throw
rocks
like
they
did
at
the
mexico
military
police
i
say
consider
it
a
rifle
trump
said
a
pentagon
spokesman
lieutenant
colonel
jamie
davis
declined
to
discuss
specifics
on
the
military
s
potential
use
of
force
but
said
that
troops
always
have
the
inherent
right
of
critics
said
the
president
was
stoking
fear
ahead
of
the
elections
in
which
trump
s
republicans
are
battling
to
keep
their
congressional
majorities
president
trump
s
attempt
to
paint
peaceful
families
seeking
asylum
as
a
national
security
threat
is
as
absurd
as
it
is
cruel
said
advocacy
group
human
rights
first
in
a
statement
the
president
is
fear
mongering
to
score
political
points
ahead
of
a
contentious
election
at
the
expense
of
people
s
the
american
civil
liberties
union
said
if
he
plans
at
some
point
to
prohibit
people
from
applying
for
asylum
between
the
ports
of
entry
that
plan
is
republican
senator
chuck
grassley
an
ally
of
the
president
and
head
of
the
powerful
senate
judiciary
committee
said
in
a
letter
to
the
secretaries
of
the
department
of
homeland
security
and
the
state
department
that
his
office
had
received
information
that
several
members
of
the
caravan
had
significant
criminal
trump
said
on
wednesday
the
united
states
could
send
as
many
as
troops
to
the
border
to
confront
the
migrant
caravan
more
than
twice
the
number
previously
disclosed
by
defence
officials
a
defence
official
said
about
troops
arrived
on
the
border
at
mcallen
texas
on
thursday
republican
lawmakers
and
other
trump
supporters
have
applauded
the
deployment
but
critics
argue
trump
has
manufactured
a
crisis
for
the
military
to
address
trump
also
said
this
week
he
would
seek
to
scrap
the
constitutional
right
of
citizenship
for
children
of
noncitizens
and
illegal
immigrants
such
an
action
would
face
a
likely
legal
challenge
