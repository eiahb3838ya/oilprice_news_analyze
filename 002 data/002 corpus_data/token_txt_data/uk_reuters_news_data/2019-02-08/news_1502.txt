britain
unveiled
a
model
of
a
sleek
proposed
fighter
jet
named
tempest
on
monday
raising
questions
about
the
future
of
european
defence
cooperation
given
that
germany
and
france
launched
their
own
fighter
jet
program
a
year
ago
at
the
farnborough
airshow
defence
minister
gavin
williamson
said
billion
pounds
billion
had
been
earmarked
to
finance
the
programme
out
to
and
that
britain
would
seek
international
partners
to
provide
additional
funding
the
aircraft
meant
to
eventually
replace
the
eurofighter
typhoon
jet
will
be
developed
and
built
by
bae
systems
plc
britain
s
biggest
defence
company
alongside
uk
holdings
plc
italian
defence
firm
leonardo
and
european
missile
maker
mbda
unveiled
before
visiting
foreign
military
chiefs
and
industry
executives
at
the
bae
chalet
the
new
jet
can
be
flown
by
a
pilot
or
operated
as
a
drone
germany
and
france
are
already
working
on
a
new
jet
with
the
program
led
by
france
s
airbus
part
of
the
eurofighter
consortium
and
dassault
aviation
sa
the
maker
of
the
rafale
industry
executives
said
the
two
programs
could
eventually
be
fused
once
britain
and
the
european
union
sorted
out
britain
s
departure
from
the
economic
bloc
in
nine
months
failure
to
unite
around
a
single
fighter
programme
risked
further
fragmenting
the
european
defence
market
but
the
decision
was
up
to
government
leaders
airbus
s
defence
chief
dirk
hoke
told
reuters
if
the
politicians
decide
differently
we
ll
have
to
adapt
but
in
my
opinion
that
would
be
bad
for
europe
he
said
leonardo
chief
executive
alessandro
profumo
also
voiced
hope
that
europe
would
unite
around
one
program
it
s
up
to
the
governments
but
europe
is
moving
more
and
more
towards
being
unified
i
have
to
be
air
simon
rochelle
from
britain
s
royal
air
force
said
britain
was
having
discussions
with
potential
partner
countries
including
sweden
and
japan
he
said
it
was
not
clear
if
the
uk
project
would
eventually
be
merged
with
the
one
adding
we
are
having
a
lot
of
conversations
with
a
lot
of
analysts
see
sweden
as
a
likely
partner
although
countries
such
as
south
korea
japan
and
turkey
or
gulf
nations
like
saudi
arabia
are
also
possibilities
but
experts
say
there
is
unlikely
to
be
sufficient
demand
to
support
two
separate
european
programmes
particularly
given
the
high
cost
of
developing
a
new
aircraft
uk
plans
call
for
the
new
jet
to
be
operational
by
in
time
to
replace
the
typhoon
fleet
when
it
ends
service
in
the
jet
is
the
centerpiece
of
a
new
uk
combat
air
strategy
that
prime
minister
theresa
may
said
was
aimed
at
maintaining
our
air
power
france
announced
in
june
that
it
would
take
a
leading
role
on
a
new
fighter
programme
that
would
start
as
a
bilateral
effort
with
germany
but
could
be
expanded
later
the
typhoon
in
contrast
was
developed
by
the
group
of
germany
spain
britain
and
italy
in
the
a
german
defence
ministry
spokesman
declined
to
comment
on
the
uk
programme
but
said
the
project
was
open
to
additional
partners
michael
christie
bae
systems
strategy
director
for
air
said
britain
had
the
capability
to
develop
tempest
alone
but
that
it
made
sense
to
develop
it
with
a
partner
given
the
cost
and
a
desire
to
lock
in
future
sales
however
he
added
that
bae
wanted
to
play
a
leading
role
in
whatever
partnership
that
we
are
involved
britain
has
not
developed
a
fighter
jet
alone
since
the
however
it
helped
develop
and
build
the
most
advanced
stealth
fighter
in
the
uk
