uzbek bloggers test - and hit - the limits of new-found freedom
tashkent
reuters
when
uzbek
authorities
detained
several
online
activists
in
september
blogger
davronbek
tojialiyev
packed
some
clothes
in
a
bag
and
waited
for
the
knock
on
his
door
the
police
never
came
and
tojialiyev
one
of
a
handful
of
bloggers
breaking
taboos
by
criticising
state
policies
and
officials
writes
on
the
s
experience
suggests
the
new
government
in
tashkent
is
willing
to
make
concessions
as
it
vows
to
ease
restrictions
that
made
uzbeks
wary
of
speaking
freely
for
the
past
years
the
detention
of
the
bloggers
however
shows
the
change
has
limits
even
as
uzbekistan
tries
to
project
a
more
liberal
image
to
foreign
investors
whose
help
it
needs
to
revive
the
economy
after
years
of
stagnation
the
government
is
still
sensitive
to
challenges
to
its
authority
including
in
the
sphere
of
religion
the
country
was
rocked
by
bombings
in
the
late
and
early
that
were
blamed
on
islamist
extremists
and
by
an
armed
uprising
in
in
which
hundreds
of
people
were
killed
tojialiyev
says
that
mixed
messages
from
the
state
on
freedom
of
expression
are
unlikely
to
stop
people
like
him
from
pushing
the
boundaries
i
was
not
afraid
of
arrest
but
i
was
ready
for
it
he
said
with
a
smile
public
criticism
of
the
government
was
unthinkable
under
former
president
islam
karimov
who
ran
the
majority
muslim
former
soviet
republic
from
until
his
death
in
critics
such
as
journalist
yusuf
ruzimuradov
spent
years
in
prison
on
charges
related
to
public
security
and
inciting
rebellion
ruzimuradov
was
released
last
march
after
years
behind
bars
during
karimov
s
time
bloggers
could
write
only
about
small
issues
mostly
social
said
tojialiyev
whose
day
job
is
running
a
catalogue
of
uzbek
literature
it
was
not
possible
to
talk
about
serious
and
political
karimov
s
successor
shavkat
mirziyoyev
has
proclaimed
a
new
era
of
openness
and
freedom
of
the
press
and
moved
to
curb
the
powers
of
the
security
forces
i
regard
as
real
journalists
the
ones
who
expose
bureaucracy
indifference
extortion
corruption
he
said
in
remarks
published
by
his
office
last
year
there
needs
to
be
plurality
of
opinions
in
the
national
media
space
he
said
the
foreign
ministry
which
answers
all
queries
from
the
international
media
including
to
the
police
did
not
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
on
this
story
mirziyoyev
s
approach
has
improved
uzbekistan
s
image
abroad
and
helped
it
start
rebuilding
ties
with
institutions
such
as
the
european
bank
for
reconstruction
and
development
ebrd
which
had
in
effect
withdrawn
from
the
country
under
karimov
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
praised
the
successful
political
and
democratic
reforms
that
are
underway
in
uzbekistan
on
a
visit
to
tashkent
last
week
the
types
of
reforms
the
president
has
embraced
here
are
essential
to
establishing
the
certitude
that
companies
need
to
open
operations
in
the
local
economy
he
told
an
chamber
of
commerce
business
forum
bordering
kazakhstan
turkmenistan
kyrgyzstan
tajikistan
and
afghanistan
the
country
of
million
produces
gold
natural
gas
and
oil
one
of
its
selling
points
to
foreign
investors
is
as
a
stepping
stone
between
russia
and
china
some
of
the
government
s
steps
have
been
clumsy
however
journalists
from
russia
who
visited
tashkent
this
month
as
members
of
president
vladimir
putin
s
media
pool
including
a
reuters
reporter
were
instructed
not
to
leave
their
hotels
without
official
minders
for
their
own
safety
the
uzbek
blogosphere
has
expanded
since
the
election
in
december
of
mirziyoyev
who
was
prime
minister
under
karimov
bloggers
writing
mostly
on
facebook
question
policies
they
see
as
excessively
strict
or
unnecessary
mirziyoyev
himself
has
a
facebook
page
as
do
many
senior
officials
although
less
than
percent
of
uzbeks
regularly
visit
facebook
one
story
that
went
viral
was
that
of
a
young
teacher
killed
by
a
truck
while
cleaning
up
a
highway
ahead
of
a
presidential
visit
last
march
part
of
a
mass
mobilisation
of
public
sector
workers
by
provincial
authorities
mirziyoyev
quickly
responded
to
the
outcry
telling
reporters
he
felt
responsible
for
the
woman
s
death
and
ordering
his
subordinates
to
stop
what
he
called
bloggers
have
become
the
moving
force
not
only
in
social
networks
but
in
society
as
well
tojialiyev
said
if
they
raise
certain
issues
the
government
is
forced
to
address
in
several
cases
authorities
have
punished
officials
after
bloggers
helped
spread
news
of
abuse
of
power
such
as
a
district
mayor
filmed
beating
headmasters
for
failing
to
bring
enough
people
to
a
national
holiday
event
on
monday
mirziyoyev
sacked
a
deputy
pm
who
was
criticised
on
social
media
after
a
photo
showed
his
subordinates
standing
in
a
ditch
full
of
water
as
a
punishment
the
announcement
did
not
mention
the
photo
but
it
follows
an
online
outcry
it
was
successes
like
these
that
emboldened
about
a
dozen
young
male
bloggers
mainly
focused
on
religious
issues
to
criticise
a
draft
of
school
uniform
regulations
in
june
that
disallowed
hijabs
headscarves
prescribed
in
islam
for
girls
and
women
after
the
government
enacted
the
regulations
in
august
bloggers
cried
foul
and
some
called
for
protests
they
were
joined
by
fazliddin
parpiyev
imam
of
one
of
tashkent
s
mosques
the
pushback
was
swift
police
arrested
at
least
eight
bloggers
and
the
imam
was
dismissed
parpiyev
told
reuters
he
remains
out
of
work
after
refusing
to
apologise
one
of
the
detained
bloggers
adham
olimov
told
reuters
a
court
sentenced
him
to
days
of
administrative
arrest
on
charges
of
disobeying
police
orders
he
and
others
were
out
of
jail
by
things
have
improved
under
karimov
we
would
have
been
sent
to
prison
for
years
said
another
blogger
who
asked
not
to
be
named
so
as
to
avoid
further
problems
but
i
am
now
avoiding
sensitive
issues
i
have
a
family
blogging
is
not
worth
going
to
jail
tojialiyev
said
he
would
continue
to
write
about
the
school
uniform
issue
however
and
criticised
the
response
as
going
against
the
spirit
of
liberal
reforms
there
was
no
official
explanation
or
response
from
the
government
on
what
was
going
on
he
said
we
live
in
a
democratic
society
or
we
claim
to
have
one
but
what
happened
was
not
in
line
with
our
claim
for
example
arresting
bloggers
on
charges
not
informing
relatives
about
the
whereabouts
of
the
detainees
and
so
tojialiyev
said
he
has
not
experienced
any
pressure
or
intimidation
from
the
authorities
but
friends
have
tried
to
persuade
him
to
be
more
careful
about
sensitive
issues
we
can
no
longer
see
the
bravery
and
fury
which
used
to
be
there
in
the
blogosphere
months
ago
he
says
bloggers
have
once
again
started
writing
about
minor
and
old
while
tojialiyev
s
optimism
may
have
wavered
his
determination
has
not
i
know
that
what
i
am
doing
is
not
a
crime
and
perhaps
that
s
why
i
am
not
afraid
also
public
and
international
pressure
is
a
factor
now
maybe
this
gives
me
