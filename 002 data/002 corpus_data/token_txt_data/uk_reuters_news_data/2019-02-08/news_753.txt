london
reuters
a
high
court
judge
has
denied
a
serious
fraud
office
application
to
charge
barclays
over
its
capital
raising
potentially
ending
the
biggest
remaining
legal
headache
facing
the
british
bank
over
its
conduct
during
the
financial
crisis
a
british
court
dismissed
the
charges
against
the
bank
last
may
in
a
decision
that
the
sfo
which
prosecutes
financial
crimes
said
it
would
seek
to
reverse
by
applying
to
the
high
court
to
reinstate
them
the
high
court
has
today
denied
the
sfo
s
application
to
reinstate
in
respect
of
all
of
the
charges
as
a
result
all
of
the
charges
remain
dismissed
barclays
said
in
a
statement
the
sfo
said
on
friday
it
could
not
comment
on
the
decision
citing
reporting
restrictions
on
other
cases
related
to
the
fundraising
which
are
set
to
continue
barclays
denied
the
sfo
s
allegation
that
a
billion
loan
it
made
to
qatar
in
november
was
connected
with
a
qatari
investment
in
the
british
bank
which
ultimately
helped
it
avoid
a
british
government
rescue
during
the
financial
crisis
qatar
which
is
a
major
investor
in
britain
has
not
been
accused
of
wrongdoing
but
public
companies
in
britain
are
normally
prohibited
from
lending
money
for
the
purchase
of
their
own
shares
known
as
financial
assistance
the
collapse
of
one
of
its
most
corporate
prosecutions
represents
a
major
setback
for
the
sfo
which
has
long
faced
criticism
from
british
politicians
and
the
verdict
deals
a
decisive
blow
to
the
unprecedented
criminal
prosecution
of
a
major
bank
over
events
which
took
place
at
the
height
of
the
credit
crisis
the
sfo
s
attempt
to
try
and
reinstate
the
charges
once
they
were
knocked
back
by
a
court
was
an
unusual
strategy
and
some
lawyers
said
they
were
not
surprised
it
had
failed
sam
tate
a
partner
at
rpc
in
london
said
he
did
not
think
it
unreasonable
of
the
sfo
to
have
attempted
the
move
and
noted
it
was
now
for
the
financial
conduct
authority
fca
and
other
authorities
to
continue
their
parallel
investigations
i
wouldn
t
describe
this
as
a
huge
setback
it
reaffirms
a
decision
already
made
by
a
lower
court
and
it
was
an
unusual
process
tate
said
separately
four
former
barclays
bankers
face
a
charge
of
conspiracy
to
commit
fraud
by
false
representation
when
they
negotiated
a
capital
injection
for
the
bank
from
qatar
in
a
trial
due
to
start
in
january
barclays
still
faces
other
legal
and
regulatory
problems
related
to
the
fundraising
the
department
of
justice
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
are
investigating
the
case
british
businesswoman
amanda
staveley
has
a
separate
