pwc says more tech is solution for higher audit standards
london
reuters
the
big
four
accounting
firms
can
invest
in
technology
that
will
raise
standards
beyond
what
could
be
achieved
by
smaller
rivals
the
head
of
pricewaterhousecoopers
pwc
said
on
tuesday
defending
the
top
firms
against
uk
calls
to
be
broken
up
british
lawmakers
want
the
country
s
competition
watchdog
to
consider
forcing
pwc
ey
kpmg
and
deloitte
the
four
accounting
firms
that
check
the
books
of
most
blue
chip
companies
globally
to
separate
out
their
audit
and
consultancy
operations
this
the
lawmakers
said
earlier
this
year
would
provide
a
better
focus
on
raising
standards
to
ensure
auditors
flag
company
difficulties
before
collapses
like
at
retailer
bhs
and
outsourcer
carillion
in
britain
various
people
are
providing
this
relatively
easy
answer
to
split
up
the
firms
but
we
do
not
support
it
pwc
global
chairman
bob
moritz
told
reuters
pwc
which
employs
over
people
will
have
invested
a
billion
dollars
on
cloud
computing
by
a
huge
sum
that
firms
outside
the
big
four
would
find
hard
to
match
such
advanced
technology
will
mean
harvesting
far
more
data
from
a
company
to
ensure
accounts
face
tougher
checks
and
balances
to
meet
the
criticisms
over
audit
standards
from
policymakers
moritz
said
any
intervention
in
the
market
must
be
well
thought
out
given
it
would
be
watched
closely
by
the
rest
of
the
world
he
added
moritz
was
speaking
as
pwc
announced
record
annual
revenues
of
billion
billion
pounds
for
its
year
ended
june
making
it
the
second
largest
accounting
firm
in
the
world
behind
deloitte
whose
latest
annual
revenues
topped
billion
moritz
said
the
focus
was
on
pwc
being
a
balanced
firm
i
don
t
want
to
be
number
one
just
for
the
sake
of
pwc
was
hit
by
a
record
million
pound
million
fine
in
june
from
britain
s
financial
reporting
council
after
it
failed
to
flag
significant
doubts
over
the
future
of
bhs
moritz
said
pwc
made
mistakes
and
had
taken
responsibility
for
its
actions
but
authorities
should
not
rush
to
carve
up
the
sector
because
of
them
the
industry
has
already
met
with
britain
s
competition
and
markets
authority
cma
to
offer
temporary
voluntary
limits
on
how
many
big
listed
companies
a
big
four
accounting
firm
could
audit
in
a
bid
to
help
smaller
rivals
expand
the
cma
has
yet
to
respond
the
challenge
is
whether
or
not
the
other
firms
have
the
skills
capability
and
staff
to
do
those
audits
as
well
moritz
said
there
is
nothing
abusive
in
the
competition
that
s
happening
he
said
adding
there
was
a
need
for
the
big
four
to
have
more
scalable
and
credible
competitors
so
far
attempts
in
britain
to
persuade
companies
to
rotate
their
accountant
every
decade
have
ended
up
creating
a
big
four
