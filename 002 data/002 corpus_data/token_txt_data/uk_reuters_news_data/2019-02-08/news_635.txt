change tack or face defeat, brexit critics tell may
london
reuters
prime
minister
theresa
may
was
under
growing
pressure
on
sunday
to
change
her
plan
for
britain
to
leave
the
european
union
to
avoid
defeat
in
a
parliamentary
vote
with
both
britain
and
the
eu
suggesting
an
agreement
is
close
eurosceptic
lawmakers
and
a
leading
member
of
a
small
northern
irish
party
that
props
up
her
conservative
government
made
new
threats
to
vote
against
the
terms
of
the
deal
she
is
working
on
with
brussels
the
vote
in
parliament
most
likely
to
come
later
this
year
is
gearing
up
to
be
the
biggest
showdown
in
the
lengthy
negotiations
to
leave
the
eu
britain
s
biggest
shift
in
foreign
and
trade
policy
in
more
than
years
may
who
was
attending
a
ceremony
to
mark
years
since
the
end
of
world
war
one
found
some
support
from
ministers
in
her
cabinet
but
it
would
be
hard
for
her
to
ignore
the
growing
calls
to
change
tack
after
a
minister
resigned
and
northern
ireland
s
democratic
unionist
party
threatened
to
rebel
if
the
government
makes
the
historic
mistake
of
prioritising
placating
the
eu
over
establishing
an
independent
and
whole
uk
then
regrettably
we
must
vote
against
the
deal
steve
baker
a
leading
eurosceptic
and
former
minister
wrote
alongside
the
dup
s
brexit
spokesman
sammy
wilson
in
the
sunday
telegraph
newspaper
the
main
battleground
is
over
a
backstop
to
prevent
the
return
of
a
hard
border
between
the
british
province
of
northern
ireland
and
ireland
something
that
would
only
come
into
force
if
a
deal
on
future
ties
can
not
guarantee
the
type
of
frictionless
trade
needed
to
keep
it
open
fears
that
proposals
would
mean
keeping
britain
inside
the
eu
s
customs
union
indefinitely
or
that
northern
ireland
would
have
to
accept
different
rules
and
regulations
to
the
rest
of
the
united
kingdom
have
focused
opposition
to
may
s
deal
eurosceptics
have
long
criticised
may
s
proposals
but
it
was
the
resignation
of
jo
johnson
the
younger
brother
to
brexit
campaign
leader
boris
johnson
that
highlighted
the
depth
of
anger
over
her
plans
many
say
may
s
desire
to
prioritise
free
flowing
trade
of
goods
with
the
rest
of
europe
will
make
britain
little
more
than
a
rule
taker
unable
to
break
free
of
brussels
decisions
comments
by
education
minister
damian
hinds
will
also
do
little
to
temper
those
concerns
he
told
the
bbc
britain
could
not
push
for
a
deal
giving
london
the
sole
right
to
say
when
it
was
ready
to
leave
any
backstop
arrangement
the
prime
minister
has
to
negotiate
something
which
is
negotiable
with
the
other
side
as
well
as
working
for
people
here
hinds
said
but
may
did
find
some
support
both
he
and
the
eurosceptic
leader
of
the
lower
house
of
parliament
andrea
leadsom
said
they
supported
the
prime
minister
i
mean
to
support
the
prime
minister
to
get
a
brexit
that
works
for
the
united
kingdom
and
the
eu
keeps
our
country
together
and
delivers
on
the
referendum
said
leadsom
who
some
media
reported
was
considering
quitting
her
post
she
said
she
did
not
expect
further
resignations
adding
i
do
urge
colleagues
to
support
the
prime
minister
we
are
at
a
very
difficult
stage
but
it
is
a
negotiation
so
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
hold
our
nerve
and
keep
