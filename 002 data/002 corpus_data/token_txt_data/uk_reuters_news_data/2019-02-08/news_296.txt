a
strip

not
inside
the
town
itself
creating
a
barrier
with
fighters
nearby
manbij
which
forces
captured
from
islamic
state
in
has
emerged
as
a
focal
point
of
new
tensions
after
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
withdraw
forces
whose
presence
has
effectively
deterred
turkey
after
the
syrian
army
announcement
syrian
rebels

in
nearby
territory
said
they
had
begun
moving

turkish

liberate

machine
guns
were
moving
towards
the
frontline
with
the
town

where
troops
have
a
military
base
is
held
by
a
local
militia
allied
to
the
ypg
which
turkey
deems
a
security
threat

rather
on
the

of
the
city
turkish
president
tayyip
erdogan
who
has
vowed
to
crush
the
ypg
said
turkish
officials
would
visit

and
discuss

indicated
turkey
was
not
in
a
hurry
to
launch
an
offensive
trump
s
abrupt
decision
to
withdraw
troops
from
syria
has
alarmed
the
fighters
who
have
fought
islamic
state
alongside
them
for
years
kurdish
leaders
are
scrambling
for
a
strategy
to
protect
their
region
stretching
across
the
north
and
east
where
the
presence
of
some
troops
has
so
far
deterred
turkey
a
deployment
of
syrian
government
forces
backed
by
russia
would
complicate
any
offensive
by
turkey
and
its
syrian
rebel
proxies
military
support
for
the
kurdish
fighters
has
infuriated
turkey
which
sees
the
ypg
as
an
extension
of
the
pkk
movement
that
has
been
waging
an
insurgency
inside
turkey
for
decades

would
guarantee
security

all
syrian
citizens

others
a
resident
inside
the

had
changed
and
he
had
not
seen
any
such
flags
the
ypg

its
fighters
had
withdrawn
from
manbij
before
to
fight
islamic
state
elsewhere
we
invite
the
syrian

to
which
we
belong
as
people
land
and
borders
to
send
its
armed
forces
to
take
over
these
positions
and
protect
manbij
in
the
face
of
turkish
threats
