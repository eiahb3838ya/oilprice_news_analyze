brexit
minister
dominic
raab
dismissed
suggestions
put
forward
by
brexit
supporters
for
britain
to
pursue
an
enhanced
free
trade
deal
saying
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
plan
was
the
only
one
to
keep
the
united
kingdom
intact
some
brexit
campaigners
in
the
governing
conservatives
including
former
brexit
minister
david
davis
has
suggested
that
the
government
should
scrap
its
chequers
plan
in
favour
of
pursuing
a
free
trade
deal
along
the
lines
of
the
one
between
the
european
union
and
canada
asked
by
a
committee
of
lawmakers
whether
he
would
agree
that
an
enhanced
deal
took
britain
further
forward
and
closer
to
a
deal
than
chequers
raab
said
i
don
t
understand
why
anyone
of
the
brexit
flavouring
would
cite
that
as
a
credible
alternative
he
said
adding
that
it
would
involve
the
backstop
for
the
northern
irish
and
ireland
border
that
may
argues
would
split
the
united
kingdom
