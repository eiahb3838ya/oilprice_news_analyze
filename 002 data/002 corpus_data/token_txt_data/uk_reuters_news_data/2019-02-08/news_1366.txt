dublin
reuters
ryanair
proposed
that
a
mediator
join
talks
with
a
trade
union
representing
its
irish
pilots
who
went
on
strike
for
a
fourth
time
on
friday
before
wider
stoppages
planned
around
europe
next
week
the
forsa
trade
union
which
had
called
for
such
mediation
welcomed
ryanair
s
response
and
said
it
would
recommend
it
to
pilots
europe
s
biggest
airline
by
passenger
numbers
agreed
to
recognise
unions
for
the
first
time
late
last
year
but
negotiations
since
have
faltered
it
has
seen
strikes
in
some
of
its
biggest
markets
including
ireland
spain
and
italy
as
it
struggles
to
reach
collective
labour
agreements
with
trade
unions
around
a
quarter
of
ryanair
s
pilots
based
in
ireland
have
taken
part
in
a
series
of
strikes
and
a
number
picketed
in
the
rain
outside
dublin
airport
on
friday
morning
ryanair
has
limited
the
damage
from
the
irish
strikes
so
far
and
said
passengers
on
the
flights
it
cancelled
from
the
that
flew
in
and
out
of
ireland
on
friday
were
either
put
on
another
flight
or
refunded
however
it
faces
greater
disruption
next
friday
with
irish
pilots
joining
colleagues
in
sweden
and
belgium
on
strike
and
ryanair
braced
for
action
in
germany
and
the
netherlands
on
the
same
day
so
far
that
has
forced
ryanair
to
cancel
percent
of
the
more
than
flights
it
has
scheduled
across
europe
next
friday
a
further
to
and
from
ireland
in
and
out
of
sweden
and
in
belgium
ryanair
shares
were
down
percent
at
euros
by
gmt
near
lows
and
well
below
the
level
hit
in
december
when
it
shocked
the
markets
by
ending
years
of
refusing
to
recognise
unions
while
the
irish
airline
has
signed
recognition
deals
in
some
markets
it
has
failed
to
do
so
in
others
and
not
yet
reached
any
collective
labour
agreements
this
is
part
and
parcel
of
life
in
aviation
when
you
recognise
unions
ryanair
chief
marketing
officer
kenny
jacobs
told
ireland
s
newstalk
radio
station
pointing
to
years
of
wrangling
over
pay
and
conditions
at
rival
lufthansa
there
is
going
to
be
disruption
it
will
be
small
we
will
manage
it
we
are
making
progress
around
the
rest
of
europe
strikes
can
be
part
of
that
process
they
are
not
helpful
but
we
will
get
collective
labour
agreements
in
place
over
the
autumn

our
