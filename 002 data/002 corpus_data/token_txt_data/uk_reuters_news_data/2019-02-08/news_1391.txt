uk factories lose steam on eve of bank of england rate decision
london
reuters
british
factories
lost
momentum
in
july
and
manufacturers
were
their
most
downbeat
in
nearly
two
years
a
survey
showed
on
wednesday
but
the
data
was
unlikely
to
deter
the
bank
of
england
from
raising
interest
rates
on
thursday
the
weak
domestic
demand
highlighted
in
the
ihs
uk
manufacturing
purchasing
managers
index
pmi
added
to
other
signs
of
a
largely
sluggish
british
economy
facing
an
uncertain
exit
from
the
european
union
in
less
than
eight
months
time
the
pmi
slipped
to
its
level
since
late
at
down
from
in
june
and
weaker
than
a
median
forecast
of
in
a
reuters
poll
of
economists
rob
dobson
an
ihs
markit
director
said
the
sector
which
accounts
for
percent
of
the
british
economy
had
provided
no
meaningful
boost
to
economic
growth
so
far
this
year
the
financial
markets
still
seem
to
have
an
interest
rate
increase
nailed
on
for
august
he
said
referring
to
thursday
s
policy
announcement
by
the
boe
however
if
the
combination
of
weaker
growth
and
a
softening
of
pipeline
cost
pressures
at
manufacturers
is
mirrored
in
the
larger
service
sector
the
bank
of
england
s
decision
will
be
far
from
unanimous
and
they
may
even
yet
find
some
cause
for
pause
he
said
the
pmi
for
britain
s
services
industry
is
due
to
be
published
on
friday
but
is
likely
to
be
shown
to
the
boe
s
policymakers
ahead
of
their
rate
decision
a
rise
in
the
boe
s
benchmark
rate
above
its
crisis
levels
is
widely
expected
on
thursday
even
though
britain
s
economy
is
growing
only
slowly
sterling
and
government
bond
prices
were
little
changed
by
wednesday
s
pmi
survey
governor
mark
carney
says
the
economy
with
unemployment
at
a
low
will
generate
too
much
inflation
unless
they
raise
borrowing
costs
gradually
over
the
coming
years
but
several
private
economists
have
challenged
the
need
for
a
rate
hike
now
pointing
to
inflation
that
is
below
the
boe
s
forecasts
and
no
clear
acceleration
in
wages
as
well
as
the
risk
of
a
disruptive
brexit
elizabeth
martins
an
hsbc
economist
said
wednesday
s
pmi
was
unlikely
to
deter
the
boe
from
raising
rates
on
thursday
but
there
were
clouds
on
the
horizon
other
than
brexit
while
uk
manufacturing
export
orders
appear
to
have
held
up
better
in
july
the
poorer
numbers
from
across
the
channel
may
pose
some
risks
going
forward
she
said
also
pointing
to
uncertainty
about
global
trade
a
leading
economic
think
tank
said
the
boe
should
raise
rates
but
also
said
it
would
make
a
if
brexit
talks
sour
or
trade
tensions
with
the
united
states
escalate
ihs
markit
s
gauge
of
manufacturing
output
fell
to
its
lowest
level
since
march
of
last
year
and
growth
in
new
orders
was
the
weakest
since
june
even
as
export
demand
rose
manufacturers
were
their
least
confident
in
months
reflecting
concerns
about
brexit
and
the
value
of
the
pound
and
there
was
another
warning
sign
in
the
first
fall
in
two
years
in
the
production
of
intermediate
goods
which
are
used
in
the
process
of
manufacturing
other
products
but
the
survey
also
showed
the
steepest
rise
in
prices
charged
by
factories
since
february
as
input
costs
continued
to
grow
strongly
albeit
a
bit
more
slowly
than
in
june
