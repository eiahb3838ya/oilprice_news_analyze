uk inflation falls again, leaving boe under no pressure on rates
london
reuters
british
inflation
hit
its
lowest
in
nearly
two
years
in
december
as
fuel
prices
fell
leaving
the
bank
of
england
under
no
pressure
to
carry
on
raising
interest
rates
as
uncertainty
over
brexit
dominates
the
economic
outlook
consumer
prices
rose
at
an
annual
rate
of
percent
in
december
slowing
from
percent
in
november
the
office
for
national
statistics
said
as
a
reuters
poll
of
economists
had
predicted
the
rise
was
the
smallest
since
january
although
inflation
remained
just
above
the
bank
s
percent
target
it
was
likely
to
fall
below
that
level
soon
and
there
was
little
immediate
urgency
for
the
boe
to
move
economists
said
the
central
bank
has
sketched
out
a
range
of
brexit
scenarios
including
a
outcome
in
which
sterling
would
plunge
to
parity
against
the
dollar
inflation
would
exceed
percent
and
the
economy
contract
by
percent
on
tuesday
mps
voted
against
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
brexit
plans
by
a
crushing
margin
boe
governor
mark
carney
said
on
wednesday
that
sterling
s
rise
after
the
vote
suggested
investors
felt
the
risk
of
a
brexit
had
diminished
or
that
the
departure
process
would
be
extended
may
faces
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
her
government
moved
by
the
opposition
labour
party
on
wednesday
that
she
is
expected
to
win
although
we
think
that
brexit
uncertainty
will
keep
the
monetary
policy
committee
on
hold
for
the
time
being
we
doubt
the
bank
will
miss
out
on
the
global
tightening
cycle
altogether
ruth
gregory
senior
uk
economist
at
capital
economics
said
the
central
bank
has
raised
interest
rates
twice
since
late
and
has
said
it
plans
to
carry
on
increasing
borrowing
costs
gradually
wednesday
s
inflation
figures
could
be
a
relief
for
british
consumers
who
have
been
pressured
by
inflation
since
the
brexit
referendum
in
june
which
triggered
a
slump
in
sterling
of
more
than
percent
against
the
dollar
and
euro
inflation
peaked
at
a
high
of
percent
in
november
it
has
fallen
since
then
and
wages
have
grown
at
their
fastest
in
a
decade
but
businesses
have
reported
a
downturn
in
consumer
spending
in
recent
months
and
surveys
show
households
are
worried
about
the
outlook
for
sterling
and
uk
government
bonds
were
little
moved
by
wednesday
s
data
which
suggested
less
pressure
in
the
pipeline
for
consumer
prices
with
factory
input
costs
rising
at
the
weakest
rate
since
june
the
ons
also
said
house
prices
in
november
rose
by
an
annual
percent
nationwide
compared
with
percent
in
october
prices
in
london
alone
fell
percent
the
fifth
month
of
decline
a
run
last
seen
