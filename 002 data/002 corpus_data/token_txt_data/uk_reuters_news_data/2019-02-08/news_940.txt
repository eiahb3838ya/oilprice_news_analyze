may
s
government
will
not
accept
two
different
customs
regimes
in
the
united
kingdom
after
brexit
so
the
european
union
needs
to
show
less
dry
legalism
in
talks
on
northern
ireland
brexit
secretary
dominic
raab
said
what
we
re
not
going
to
do
is
see
the
united
kingdom
carved
up
into
two
separate
customs
regimes
that
is
just
not
on
the
table
frankly
i
think
it
s
outrageous
even
to
contemplate
it
raab
told
sky
news
we
need
to
see
a
bit
less
dry
legalism
and
dry
dogmatism
and
a
bit
more
of
the
flexibility
that
we
have
demonstrated
in
our
white
paper
