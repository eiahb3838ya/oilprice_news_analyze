won
t
disrupt
their
supply
chains
we
will
take
back
control
of
our
borders
our
laws
and
our
money
but
we
will
do
so
in
a
way
that
is
good
for
business
and
good
for
our
future
prosperity
she
said
businesses
have
been
getting
increasingly
frustrated
about
the
lack
of
clarity
over
future
trading
relations
less
than
nine
months
before
brexit
day
on
march
airbus
which
employs
around
people
in
britain
warned
earlier
this
month
that
if
britain
left
the
eu
without
a
deal
a
hard
brexit
it
could
result
in
production
at
its
factories
stopping
and
aircraft
being
grounded
also
at
the
air
show
britain
s
defence
minister
gavin
williamson
unveiled
a
model
of
a
new
fighter
jet
called
tempest
that
the
country
plans
to
build
he
announced
billion
pounds
billion
of
funding
for
the
project
to
and
said
he
was
looking
for
other
countries
to
join
with
a
senior
royal
air
force
official
saying
sweden
was
the
most
likely
partner
the
project
faces
competition
from
a
rival
european
one
after
france
announced
in
june
that
it
would
take
a
leading
role
on
a
new
fighter
programme
saying
it
would
start
as
a
bilateral
effort
with
germany
that
could
be
expanded
later
worries
on
the
civilian
side
the
air
show
is
expected
to
confirm
demand
for
narrowbody
jets
from
airlines
such
as
mexico
s
vivaaerobus
which
is
shopping
for
some
airbuses
and
lessors
like
goshawk
which
ordered
jets
on
monday
but
is
also
expected
to
be
interested
in
max
major
lessors
air
lease
and
avolon
are
also
in
town
but
both
airbus
and
boeing
are
under
pressure
to
increase
orders
for
some
of
their
jets
due
to
a
recent
slowdown
in
that
part
of
the
market
one
exception
is
the
boeing
after
a
effort
to
end
delays
and
cost
overruns
speaking
after
the
deal
for
with
starlux
airbus
chief
commercial
officer
eric
schulz
said
he
was
confident
the
market
for
such
planes
would
pick
up
what
i
have
said
consistently
is
that
i
see
the
market
picking
up
within
months
i
am
quite
there
are
explanations
as
to
why
this
wave
is
now
coming
we
had
a
very
massive
wave
years
ago
with
a
lot
of
orders
i
think
the
market
had
to
pause
a
little
bit
until
we
could
deliver
consistently
and
get
to
ramp
up
and
rate
i
think
this
is
behind
us
