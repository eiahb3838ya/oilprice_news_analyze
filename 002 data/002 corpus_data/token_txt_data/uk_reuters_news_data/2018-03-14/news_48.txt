volkswagen
s
core
autos
division
said
costs
for
its
programme
technology
and
a
new
emissions
testing
procedure
will
stand
in
the
way
of
major
profitability
gains
this
year
and
in
future
vw
s
namesake
brand
expects
its
operating
profit
margin
to
climb
to
between
and
percent
this
year
a
range
it
is
also
targeting
for
the
carmaker
said
on
wednesday
cost
reductions
efforts
to
weed
out
complexity
in
parts
and
models
and
rising
sales
of
vehicles
helped
to
more
than
double
the
profitability
benchmark
to
percent
last
year
but
vw
on
wednesday
damped
hopes
for
further
significant
profitability
gains
this
year
and
over
the
next
few
years
the
brand
will
face
severe
challenges
despite
its
improved
competitiveness
vw
said
citing
costs
for
electric
cars
technology
and
the
new
wltp
testing
procedure
for
emissions
and
fuel
consumption
