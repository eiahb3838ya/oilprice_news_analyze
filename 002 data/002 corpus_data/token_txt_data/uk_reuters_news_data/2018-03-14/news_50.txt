reuters
south
australians
go
to
the
polls
on
saturday
in
a
tight
race
with
big
implications
for
national
politics
and
foreign
investment
in
a
state
with
the
most
wind
and
solar
power
but
the
highest
electricity
prices
in
the
country
while
its
outcome
will
not
dislodge
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
the
vote
presents
a
choice
between
renewable
energy
pushed
by
south
australia
s
labor
government
and
coal
backed
by
turnbull
s
conservative
government
which
has
mocked
the
state
s
big
experiment
in
wind
and
solar
energy
south
australia
s
economy
has
suffered
blow
after
blow
in
the
last
six
years
with
mining
giant
bhp
billiton
scrapping
a
plan
to
expand
its
olympic
dam
copper
mine
in
the
collapse
of
steel
maker
arrium
and
a
blackout
in
followed
by
general
motors
closure
of
its
holden
car
plant
last
year
labor
in
power
for
years
has
turned
to
renewable
energy
luring
foreign
investors
such
as
elon
musk
s
tesla
which
built
the
world
s
biggest
battery
at
a
windfarm
run
by
france
s
neoen
and
british
billionaire
sanjeev
gupta
who
wants
to
revive

works
using

we
re
sending
really
a
market
signal
to
the
world
to
come
to
south

state
premier
jay
weatherill
said
at
the
launch
of
a
poll
campaign
that
targets
percent
of
state
energy
to
come
from
renewables
by
south
australia
already
gets
nearly
half
its
electricity
from
renewables
but
has
suffered
blackouts
when
power
from
coal
and
gas
is
unavailable
the
plan
is
a
potential
bonanza
for
renewable
energy
developers
as
south
australia
has
the
nation
s
highest
power
prices
which
are
a
big
deterrent
to
other
investors
along
with
supply
reliability
concerns
south
australians
know
that
jay
weatherill
is
like
a
problem
gambler
doubling
down
to
chase
his
losses
on
energy
policy
josh
frydenberg
the
federal
energy
minister
said
in
an
email
to
reuters
if
labor
wins
an
unprecedented
fifth
term
it
will
be
a
blow
to
the
federal
government
s
plans
for
a
national
energy
policy
that
has
no
renewable
energy
target
but
sets
requirements
for
emissions
cuts
and
reliability
south
australia
s
liberal
party
promises
to
cut
power
bills
by
cancelling
labor
s
plan
for
a
new
power
plant
and
fund
instead
a
new
power
link
to
a
neighbouring
state
to
back
up
wind
and
solar
power
the
federal
government
has
proposed
its
own
plan
but
it
requires
all
the
states
to
sign
up
south
australia
has
refused
to
go
along
concluding
it
could
inhibit
their
plans
for
higher
renewables
said
david
blowers
an
energy
policy
specialist
at
the
grattan
institute
if
the
liberals
were
to
win
in
south
australia
you
would
expect
the
government
will
get
the
approval
it
needs
to
labor
and
liberals
are
running
almost
with
support
of
percent
and
percent
respectively
the
latest
newspoll
on
the
south
australian
election
showed
clean
air
is
also
the
hottest
issue
in
a
federal
on
saturday
in
melbourne
capital
of
the
southeastern
state
of
victoria
where
labor
is
battling
the
greens
over
the
fate
of
a
huge
coal
project
a
win
for
the
greens
australia
s
fourth
largest
political
party
would
complicate
the
legislative
agenda
for
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
whose
government
holds
just
a
majority
