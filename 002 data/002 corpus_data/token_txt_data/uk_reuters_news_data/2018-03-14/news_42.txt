oil companies temper iraq's dreams of production expansion
london
reuters
iraq
opec
s
producer
of
crude
is
hitting
a
roadblock
in
the
next
phase
of
expanding
its
oil
production
capacity
as
the
appetite
of
international
energy
firms
for
investing
in
the
country
s
environment
slackens
having
slashed
production
targets
in
and
most
international
oil
firms
in
iraq
are
revising
their
oilfields
plateau
production
levels
even
lower
and
the
discussions
involved
are
moving
slowly
iraqi
and
company
sources
say
growth
has
been
the
hallmark
of
iraq
s
oil
production
in
the
past
decade
with
a
rise
of
over
million
barrels
per
day
to
a
peak
of
million
bpd
in
late
reuters
assessments
show
iraq
owes
much
of
that
growth
to
the
likes
of
bp
exxon
mobil
lukoil
eni
total
and
royal
dutch
shell
which
oversaw
the
redevelopment
of
its
oilfields
after
the
invasion
in
progress
to
plateau
production
levels
in
iraq
but
those
companies
have
long
complained
that
the
technical
service
contracts
baghdad
offers
are
too
stringent
and
give
little
return
on
investment
most
companies
in
the
past
five
years
negotiated
their
production
plateaus
lower
forcing
iraq
to
reduce
its
capacity
expansion
plan
from
million
bpd
to
million
bpd
by
now
this
new
target
is
far
from
attainable
and
iraq
aims
to
raise
capacity
to
million
bpd
by
all
companies
except
petronas
and
total
are
suggesting
their
plateaus
be
lowered
abdul
mahdi
head
of
the
iraqi
oil
ministry
s
licensing
and
contracts
office
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
a
conference
in
berlin
last
month
told
reporters
in
principle
we
accept
that
we
reduce
the
plateau
level
for
certain
fields
to
lower
production
rates
but
this
is
all
under
total
with
partner
petrochina
has
committed
to
phase
three
of
the
expansion
of
the
halfaya
oilfield
which
will
double
production
there
to
bpd
in
petronas
is
on
track
to
attain
production
of
bpd
at
its
garraf
oilfield
iraq
monthly
crude
oil
production
what
you
re
seeing
now
is
a
second
wave
of
renegotiations
in
light
of
the
oil
price
and
the
fact
that
budgets
are
down
considerably
compared
to
five
years
ago
ian
thom
principal
analyst
at
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
said
there
are
alternatives
in
tight
oil
and
deepwater
from
many
of
the
iraq
players
that
are
more
favourable
thom
said
only
lukoil
has
so
far
reached
a
preliminary
agreement
with
the
oil
ministry
on
a
lower
plateau
target
bringing
the
goal
for
its
west
qurna
oilfield
down
to
bpd
from
million
bpd
said
but
the
two
sides
have
not
yet
finalised
talks
as
discussions
continue
on
when
lukoil
can
hit
the
new
target
he
said
we
are
in
discussions
but
nothing
has
been
approved
yet
said
iraq
wants
the
plateau
to
be
hit
earlier
than
lukoil
does
said
but
he
declined
to
specify
which
timeframes
were
being
discussed
lukoil
declined
to
comment
delays
in
such
negotiations
are
a
headache
for
any
oil
company
that
needs
to
plan
its
annual
budget
based
on
how
many
oilfields
it
wants
to
drill
and
what
new
facilities
it
needs
to
bring
extra
production
on
stream
the
impact
of
negotiation
delays
is
being
felt
disproportionately
with
companies
that
have
production
levels
farthest
from
the
previously
agreed
plateau
feeling
the
most
heat
a
source
at
one
of
those
firms
told
reuters
iraq
s
oil
capacity
is
near
million
bpd
and
it
can
easily
increase
that
by
a
further
percent
in
the
next
year
or
two
even
without
a
new
agreement
on
plateaus
analysts
and
industry
sources
say
if
you
bring
the
few
fields
where
there
is
activity
under
way
and
if
the
kirkuk
and
bai
hassan
fields
return
you
could
see
production
capacity
from
existing
investments
getting
close
to
million
bpd
in
the
next
year
or
two
thom
said
but
beyond
those
investments
at
oilfields
such
as
rumaila
west
qurna
halfaya
and
zubair
you
would
certainly
expect
a
of
iraq
s
oil
production
with
the
element
of
natural
decline
