according

an
official
from
a
south
korean
utility
said
the
increased
fuel
oil
demand
was
partly
a
result
of
the
government
s
decision
to
halt
plants
temporarily
due
to
pollution
and
reduced
nuclear
power
because
of

maintenance

coal

about

nuclear
around

natural

the
rest
comes
from
oil
and
renewables
even
with
the
increase
in
fuel
oil
purchases
south
korea
will
have
to
raise
imports
of
other

to
meet
demand
as
nearly
half

its
nuclear

plants
are
down
