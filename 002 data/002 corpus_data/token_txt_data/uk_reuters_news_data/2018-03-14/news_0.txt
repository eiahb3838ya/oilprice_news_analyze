programme
to
halt
deforestation
in

republic
of
congo
home
to
the
world
s
rainforest
is
harming
local
communities
and
failing
to
protect
forests
land
rights
researchers
said
on
wednesday
the
group
rights
and
resources
initiative
rri
called
on
the
world
bank
to
withhold
funding
from
current
or
pending
projects
in
the
province
of
which
has
been
a
test
case
for
a
conservation
scheme
known
as
in
an
area
rife
with
land
conflict
an
rri
report
said
the
forest
protection
projects
in
this
western
province
threatened
the
rights
and
incomes
of
rural
women
and
indigenous
groups
including
about
pygmies
was
created
to
both
halt
deforestation
and
benefit
local
communities
yet
the
current
projects
in
fail
to
address
both
objectives

the
report
s
author
a
spokesman
for
the
s
programme
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
the
world
bank
was
not
immediately
available
for
comment
one
of
the
focal
cases
involves
company
wildlife
works
carbon
wwc
which
denied
the
accusations
the
company
obtained
a
large
land
concession
in
order
to
protect
a
forest
from
loggers
and
uses
a
share
of
the
money
earned
from
selling
carbon
credits
to
benefit
people
living
there
said
president
mike
korchinsky
millions
of
dollars
of
benefits
have
gone
to
the
communities
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
he
said
wwc
had
built
schools
invested
in
medical
clinics
and
provided
years
of
agricultural
support
but
gauthier
said
local
communities
which
signed
agreements
with
the
company
were
not
properly
consulted
and
claimed
the
project
had
hindered
their
farming
and
other
activities
these
communities
actually
bear
the
burden
of
reducing
deforestation
she
said
rri
said
women
and
minorities
had
been
worst
affected
by
the
projects
that
were
up
and
running
because
they
often
lack
formal
land
rights
and
are
not
consulted
about
decisions
or
reduced
emissions
from
deforestation
and
degradation
was
one
of
the
solutions
to
climate
change
laid
out
in
the
paris
accord
it
offers
monetary
incentives
to
scale
back
deforestation
congo
could
become
the
first
country
to
sign
a
deal
with
the
world
bank
this
year
setting
an
example
for
more
than
developing
countries
that
plan
to
follow
suit
said
rri
however
it
warned
that
deal
could
exacerbate
conflict
and
set
a
dangerous
global
precedent
if
changes
were
not
made
rri
said
it
had
shared
the
results
and
that
discussions
with
donors
were
underway
