on
wednesday

would
be
hit
even
as

sales
and
deliveries
at
the
german
firm
were
forecast
to
hit
new
records
this
year
vw

told
a
media
briefing
the
european
union
has
proposed
tougher
vehicle
emissions
targets
for
and
to
reduce
carbon
dioxide
and
other
greenhouse
gases
carmakers
which
are
racing
to
develop
electric

evs
can
be
fined
for
violating
the
limits
the
vw
brand
shoulders
the
bulk
of
volkswagen
group
s
development
spending
as
well
as
costs
related
to
the
dieselgate
emissions
scandal
vw
finance
chief
arno
antlitz
said
vw
faced
heavy
financial
demands
due
to
bottlenecks
expected
from
introducing
wltp
lab
tests
related
to
car
emissions
and
fuel
consumption
regulations
to
curb
emissions
and
ev
development
costs
the
fleet
targets

certainly
pose
the
greatest
challenge

doubled
its
return
on

on
the
back
of
cuts
in
research

development
spending
lower
production
costs
and
rising
sales
of
sport
utility
vehicles
which
deliver
higher
margins
the
carmaker
said
its
operating
margin
might
come
in
between

percent
this
year
a
range
it
said
it
would
also
maintain
in
the
year
before
a
new
lower
limit
of
grams
of

takes
effect
this
year
and
over
the
next
few
years
the

will
face
severe
challenges
despite
its
improved
competitiveness

further
cost
savings
expansion
