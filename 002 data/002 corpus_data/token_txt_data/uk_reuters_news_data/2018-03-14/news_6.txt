new

reuters
oil
prices
gained
percent
in
choppy
trade
on
wednesday
after
a
report
showing
a
crude
stock
build
was
offset
by
large
distillate
and
gasoline
inventory
draws
crude
stocks
rose
by
million
barrels
the
biggest
jump
since
late
january
the
energy
information
administration
eia
said
expectations
had
been
for
a
million
barrel
build
but
there
was
a
draw
on
fuel
stocks
we
re
not
pressuring
the
downside
that
much
of
course
the
reason
is
because
we
had
some
unexpectedly
large
draws
in
distillates
and
gasoline
that
when
added
together
are
two
times
bigger
than
the
crude
build
said
bob
yawger
director
of
energy
futures
at
mizuho
brent
crude
oil
futures
were
up
cents
or
percent
to
settle
at
per
barrel
west
texas
intermediate
wti
futures
also
gained
cents
to
settle
at
per
barrel
i
don
t
think
we
have
a
clear
set
of
directions
and
i
don
t
think
this
eia
report
gives
that
much
of
an
insight
as
to
whether
the
rebalance
continues
or
not
we
continue
to
just
chop
around
here

mcgillian
manager

research
at
tradition
energy
prices
were
pressured
after
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
said
in
its
monthly
report
that
supply
from
is
likely
to
grow
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
almost
double
the
growth
it
predicted
in
november
largely
due
to
rising
supply
opec
also
said
oil
inventories
across
the
most
industrialized
countries
rose
in
january
for
the
first
time
in
eight
months
a
sign
the
impact
of
its
output
cuts
may
be
waning
opec
trimmed
its
demand
forecast
for
its
own
crude
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
a
fourth
consecutive
decline
according
to
the
opec
report
demand
for
opec
s
oil
must
be
million
barrels
per
day
for
the
rest
of
the
year
to
get
rid
of
any
remaining
oversupply
commerzbank
strategist
carsten
fritsch
said
oil
prices
got
a
boost
early
in
the
session
from
a
broader
investor
push
into
commodities
after
chinese
data
showed
industrial
production
in
the
world
s
largest
importer
of
raw
materials
grew
more
than
expected
over
the
first
two
months
of
the
year
oil
may
also
soon
get
some
support
from
seasonal
demand
we
are
now
only
two
to
four
weeks
away
from
when
weekly
oil
inventory
data
will
start
to
draw
again
which
should
be
supportive
for
oil
prices
