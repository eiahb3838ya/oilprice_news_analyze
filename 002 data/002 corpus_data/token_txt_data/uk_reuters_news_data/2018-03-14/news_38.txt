bosnia
s
maiden
wind
farm
began
producing
electricity
on
wednesday
as
part
of
the
country
s
efforts
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
meet
the
renewable
energy
standards
of
the
european
union
it
aspires
to
join
the
megawatt
mw
mesihovina
wind
power
plant
located
near
the
northwestern
town
of
tomislavgrad
consists
of
turbines
and
can
produce
gwh
of
power
a
year
or
enough
to
supply
households
the
turbines
are
set
in
terrain
ascending
the
duvanjsko
field
the
project
was
commissioned
by
majority
power
utility
elektroprivreda
hzhb
ehzhb
the
smallest
of
the
three
power
utilities
operating
in
the
balkan
country
and
took
years
to
complete
bosnia
generates
percent
of
its
electricity
from
power
plants
and
the
remainder
from
it
plans
to
increase
the
share
of
renewable
energy
to
percent
by
we
hope
that
this
project
which
has
a
safe
future
on
the
energy
market
will
encourage
new
investment
in
renewable
sources
the
utility
s
general
manager
marinko
gilja
said
at
an
opening
ceremony
elektroprivreda
hzhb
which
itself
operates
seven
plants
with
a
combined
capacity
of
mw
relies
on
imports
to
cover
demand
in
increasingly
dry
weather
conditions
the
new
capacity
will
boost
its
output
by
percent
ehzhb
s
profit
dropped
percent
last
year
as
a
long
drought
and
soaring
temperatures
lowered
water
levels
across
the
western
balkans
hitting
output
and
driving
demand
and
spot
power
prices
sharply
higher
the
project
built
at
a
total
cost
of
million
euros
million
was
financed
mainly
through
a
loan
provided
by
german
development
bank
kfw
while
germany
s
siemens
supplied
the
turbines
several
developers
are
seeking
to
add
around
mw
in
wind
capacity
in
bosnia
over
the
coming
years
but
only
four
have
been
issued
permits
so
far
due
to
steady
winds
from
the
adriatic
and
western
balkan
mountains
energy
experts
expect
the
newly
installed
wind
capacity
in
the
region
could
reach
gw
within
five
years
