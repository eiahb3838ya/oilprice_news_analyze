trump
fired
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
on
tuesday
after
a
series
of
public
rifts
over
policy
on
north
korea
russia
and
iran
replacing
his
chief
diplomat
with
hawkish
cia
director
mike
pompeo
critics
said
the
move
would
sow
more
instability
in
the
volatile
trump
administration
and
marks
the
departure
of
another
moderate
who
sought
to
emphasize
the
united
states
strong
ties
to
its
allies
separately
trump
is
also
looking
to
impose
tariffs
on
up
to
billion
of
chinese
imports
targeted
at
information
technology
consumer
electronics
and
telecoms
two
people
who
had
discussed
the
issue
with
the
trump
administration
said
tillerson
s
departure
has
left
some
worrying
that
it
provides
a
green
light
to
those
in
the
office
pushing
for
more
protectionist
measures
analysts
at
anz
bank
said
in
a
note
to
clients
protectionism
is
on
the
investors
suspect
policy
makers
who
favour
protectionism
will
also
seek
to
use
the
currency
as
a
trade
weapon
if
not
overtly
then
through
benign
neglect
tillerson
s
exit
and
the
potential
for
new
import
duties
on
china
coincided
with
subdued
consumer
price
data
with
annual
core
inflation
at
percent
meeting
expectations
all
that
put
together
meant
dollar
weakness
across
a
basket
of
currencies
it
was
a
touch
firmer
at
yen
but
still
not
far
from
a
recent
trough
of
the
euro
rose
overnight
to
edge
towards
a
recent
top
of
it
was
last
at
many
traders
feel
that
equities
could
have
ended
higher
if
it
weren
t
for
rexit
analysts
at
citi
said
referring
to
tillerson
s
departure
it
was
the
fear
of
higher
inflation
and
faster
rate
hikes
that
had
hit
global
shares
in
early
february
but
tuesday
s
data
did
little
to
change
market
expectations
of
fed
rate
rises
with
an
increase
next
week
now
fully
while
tillerson
s
exit
has
been
rumoured
for
months
it
speaks
to
persistent
trump
turnover
and
potentially
more
protectionist
headlines
citi
analysts
added
since
trump
took
office
in
as
many
as
senior
officials
from
his
administration
have
walked
out
including
tillerson
according
to
citi
in
commodities
oil
prices
inched
up
after
two
straight
days
of
losses
after
data
showed
a
build
in
crude
inventories
crude
rose
cents
to

gold
was
steady
