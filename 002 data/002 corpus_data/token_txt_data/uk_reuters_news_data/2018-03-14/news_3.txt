by

grigas
march
reuters
as
another
energy
conflict
is
erupting
between
russia
and
ukraine
moscow
seeks
to
start
construction
of
the
second
branch
of
the
nord
stream
pipeline
to
deliver
russian
natural
gas
directly
to
germany
while
the
european
union
countries
remain
divided
the
united
states
needs
to
maintain
its
consistent
and
principled
position
to
reduce
europe
s
on
russian
natural
gas
on
march
russian
state
gas
company
gazprom
announced
that
it
would
terminate
all
gas
contracts
with
ukraine
s
energy
company
naftogaz
after
a
stockholm
arbitration
court
ordered
gazprom
to
pay
more
than
billion
to
naftogaz
for
failing
to
uphold
contractual
obligations
regarding
volumes
of
transit
gas
through
ukraine
gazprom
s
apparent
reprisal
has
increased
european
fears
of
a
possible
gas
war
in
the
midst
of
a
cold
winter
ukraine
has
already
closed
schools
to
conserve
energy
and
the
eu
is
worried
about
its
own
gas
supplies
these
fears
could
play
into
gazprom
s
efforts
to
push
through
its
nord
stream
which
moscow
presents
as
a
simple
business
project
to
ensure
europe
s
gas
supply
to
buy
into
this
line
of
thinking
however
is
to
misunderstand
the
rationale
for
this
project
gazprom
is
not
a
commercial
entity
but
the
right
hand
of
the
kremlin
and
russia
today
is
no
ally
of
europe
but
rather
a
sanctioned
state
engaged
in
war
on
the
continent
and
bent
on
destabilizing
the
eu
and
nato
nord
stream
may
give
the
russian
military
a
freer
hand
in
ukraine
impede
the
eu
s
foreign
policy
and
energy
strategy
and
increase
moscow
s
influence
over
germany
s
political
and
business
elites
thus
aggravating
divisions
between
europe
and
the
united
states
initially
conceived
in
moscow
as
a
means
of
eliminating
uncooperative
transit
countries
from
its
gas
business
the
nord
stream
project
gained
momentum
when
kiev
started
turning
toward
the
west
in
the
years
following
its
orange
revolution
the
first
nord
stream
pipeline
was
completed
in
and
following
the
annexation
of
crimea
and
the
war
in
eastern
ukraine
moscow
has
vowed
to
limit
gas
flows
through
ukraine
by
the
end
of
the
nord
stream
infrastructure
would
enable
gazprom
to
cut
ukraine
out
of
gas
transit
traffic
which
could
cost
the
country
about
billion
in
transit
fees
the
equivalent
of
nearly
percent
of
its
projected
budget
for
revenues
aside
as
polish
prime
minister
mateusz
morawiecki
recently
stated
in
berlin
the
real
danger
lies
in
the
fact
that
russia
can
launch
a
massive
land
offensive
against
ukraine
without
fear
of
damaging
ukraine
s
pipeline
infrastructure
and
interrupting
gazprom
s
exports
to
western
countries
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
disagrees
with
morawiecki
saying
that
nord
stream
is
an
economic
project
that
poses
no
danger
to
energy
diversification
german
business
interests
see
economic
benefits
if
the
country
becomes
a
key
european
gas
distribution
hub
for
russian
gas
likewise
germany
wants
to
ensure
its
gas
supply
as
it
is
phasing
out
nuclear
power
unfortunately
completing
nord
stream
would
go
counter
to
the
main
principles
of
the
eu
s
energy
and
foreign
policy
strategy
it
would
challenge
nearly
two
decades
of
brussels
efforts
of
trying
to
boost
eu
energy
security
by
offering
alternatives
to
russian
gas
such
as
pursuing
the
southern
gas
corridor
pipeline
to
bring
caspian
gas
to
europe
investing
in
lng
import
terminals
and
pipeline
interconnections
and
increasing
reliance
on
renewables
as
well
as
supporting
ukraine
and
maintaining
unity
moscow
germany
does
not
seem
to
have
learned
any
lessons
from
its
history
as
i
write
in
my
newest
book
on
the
geopolitics
of
gas
when
german
chancellor
willy
brandt
signed
the
country
s
first
gas
contract
with
the
soviets
in
he
considered
such
gas
trade
as
part
of
his
ostpolitik
an
economic
policy
toward
the
east
that
could
reduce
cold
war
tensions
and
help
reestablish
contact
with
communist
east
germany
but
it
was
washington
s
military
spending
and
containment
policy
not
the
german
marks
that
went
to
moscow
that
eventually
bankrupted
the
soviet
union
and
brought
down
the
berlin
wall
washington
should
recall
its
own
efforts
during
the
cold
war
era
when
it
tried
to
discourage
its
european
allies
from
dependence
on
soviet
gas
president
ronald
reagan
imposed
sanctions
on
the
ussr
in
late
in
response
to
soviet
martial
law
in
poland
and
also
to
block
soviet
construction
of
the
pipeline
that
would
have
brought
vast
quantities
of
siberian
gas
to
germany
and
western
europe
in
the
administration
extended
sanctions
to
american
energy
equipment
so
it
would
not
be
used
for
the
pipeline
s
construction
yet
the
effort
failed
to
convince
europe
and
by
late
washington
cancelled
the
sanctions
while
the
pipeline
was
built
today
the
united
states
faces
a
similar
predicament
washington
s
july
russia
sanctions
threatened
to
target
nord
stream
but
the
most
recent
sanctions
implemented
in
january
did
not
do
so
explicitly
more
recently
poland
has
called
for
nord
stream
to
be
included
under
sanctions
there
is
still
time
for
president
donald
trump
to
try
to
achieve
what
reagan
could
not
and
derail
russian
pipeline
plans
american
sanctions
against
nord
stream
would
not
be
easy
to
implement
given
the
resistance
from
countries
like
germany
austria
the
netherlands
and
france
german
support
for
future
russia
sanctions
is
crucial
but
getting
merkel
to
agree
to
add
nord
stream
to
these
measures
seems
unlikely
instead
washington
should
push
brussels
to
take
a
harder
look
at
nord
stream
s
compliance
with
eu
energy
policy
while
washington
today
has
less
sway
over
its
european
allies
than
it
did
during
the
height
of
the
cold
war
the
united
states
can
now
offer
europe
an
alternative
to
russian
gas
american
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
american
lng
has
been
exported
to
europe
since
and
expanded
to
include
countries
like
poland
and
lithuania
last
year
the
abundance
of
gas
in
the
global
markets
due
to
the
booming
global
lng
trade
makes
nord
stream
less
commercially
or
strategically
necessary
for
europeans
already
opinions
have
shifted
in
europe
denmark
initially
accepted
nord
stream
but
has
had
a
change
of
heart
about
its
second
phase
danish
legislators
passed
a
law
this
year
that
could
allow
the
government
to
ban
russia
s
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
from
going
through
its
waters
for
security
reasons
based
on
this
new
law
the
danish
energy
agency
will
likely
release
its
decision
on
nord
stream
s
application
for
permission
to
pass
through
danish
waters
by
the
end
of
march
however
as
danish
sources
told
me
on
a
recent
visit
copenhagen
wants
the
eu
to
take
the
lead
on
any
pipeline
decision
this
would
prevent
denmark
from
damaging
its
relations
with
germany
and
the
united
states
and
incurring
the
wrath
of
russia
it
would
also
prevent
russia
from
developing
an
alternative
route
to
bypass
danish
waters
and
eliminate
the
division
emerging
in
the
eu
as
some
member
states
the
czech
republic
estonia
croatia
hungary
lithuania
latvia
poland
romania
and
slovakia
oppose
the
project
fifty
years
since
the
first
soviet
pipelines
were
laid
to
supply
western
european
countries
with
soviet
gas
the
eu
stands
again
at
a
crossroads
in
its
energy
policy
while
security
considerations
and
economic
interests
divide
the
eu
countries
washington
should
continue
to
make
its
opposition
clear
nord
stream
has
no
place
in
europe
s
security
and
energy
strategy
