oil majors give in to investors with share buyback spree
reuters
after
almost
three
barren
years
for
investors
who
have
poured
millions
into
the
oil
sector
producers
are
finally
opening
the
floodgates
to
a
wave
of
share
buybacks
that
will
return
money
to
shareholders
this
year
oil
production
topped
million
barrels
per
day
earlier
this
year
approaching
a
record
set
in
but
until
recently
many
investors
in
the
shale
oil
revolution
were
still
waiting
for
their
payday
here
since
the
beginning
of
year
companies
have
promised
buybacks
with
six
alone
in
the
past
three
weeks
including
devon
energy
hess
corp
and
noble
energy
inc
in
all
companies
have
committed
to
buy
back
about
billion
worth
of
shares
since
february
graphic
buyback
mania
the
united
states
second
largest
producer
chevron
corp
also
weighed
in
last
week
hinting
it
would
start
buying
back
shares
if
it
produced
stronger
cash
flow
in
the
payouts
come
courtesy
of
a
combination
of
higher
and
more
stable
oil
prices
and
pressure
from
investors
west
texas
intermediate
wti
has
more
than
doubled
crossing
per
barrel
back
in
oil
fell
to
its
lowest
in
years
there
was
a
time
when
the
consensus
was
that
we
d
be
stuck
at
around
a
barrel
for
oil
and
obviously
conditions
have
improved
since
then
said
derek
rollingson
a
portfolio
manager
at
icon
advisers
there
is
a
disconnect
between
commodity
prices
and
returns
from
exploration
and
production
before
oil
started
to
take
a
downturn
in
energy
companies
had
spent
billions
of
dollars
in
exploration
and
new
projects
when
oil
fell
below
producers
in
north
america
sought
to
raise
cash
by
selling
more
shares
pushing
down
stock
prices
the
s
p
energy
index
is
down
about
percent
since
when
oil
prices
topped
a
barrel
wall
street
finally
put
its
foot
down
last
year
here
with
investors
demanding
a
shift
to
dividends
and
share
buybacks
exxon
mobil
was
punished
for
ignoring
the
demands
and
focusing
on
its
expansion
plans
i
ve
seen
companies
going
to
boston
to
get
yelled
at
that
s
how
angry
shareholders
are
david
beard
lead
energy
analyst
at
research
firm
coker
and
palmer
said
reacting
to
market
sentiments
hess
and
devon
said
they
would
either
buy
back
billion
worth
of
shares
or
add
that
much
to
existing
programs
anadarko
added
a
further
million
to
its
buyback
program
while
noble
energy
authorized
a
repurchase
of
million
for
hess
the
announcement
was
also
a
way
to
avoid
a
skirmish
with
activist
hedge
fund
elliott
management
ahead
of
nominations
for
its
board
elliott
which
owns
more
than
percent
of
hess
had
criticized
the
company
for
continuing
underperformance
but
supported
the
buy
back
program
earlier
this
month
we
believe
that
repurchasing
our
shares
represents
a
highly
compelling
return
opportunity
for
our
shareholders
said
hess
energy
chief
executive
officer
john
hess
shale
producers
have
started
believing
they
can
drill
more
profitably
as
crude
prices
hold
steady
at
around
a
barrel
propping
up
share
prices
also
makes
sense
if
they
do
want
to
raise
more
funds
to
invest
over
the
next
year
as
long
as
oil
holds
to
current
prices
companies
can
afford
to
keep
focusing
on
shareholder
returns
analysts
said
i
think
we
re
likely
at
the
beginning
of
a
theme
there
is
a
lot
of
room
to
improve
in
terms
