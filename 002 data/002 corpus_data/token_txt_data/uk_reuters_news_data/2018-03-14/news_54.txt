asian
shares
faltered
on
wednesday
amid
fears
of
rising
protectionism
as
president
donald
trump
fired
his
secretary
of
state
regarded
as
a
moderate
in
his
administration
and
sought
to
impose
hefty
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
the
combination
of
moves
by
trump
left
investors
scurrying
for
safety
as
global
equities
took
a
knock
the
dollar
fell

the

intensified
after

following

of
public
rifts
over
policy
on
north

russia
and
iran
he
was
replaced
with

cia
director
mike

the
move
comes
only
days
after
the
exit
of
white
house
economic
advisor
gary
cohn
who
was
a
strong
proponent
of
free
trade
reinforcing
investor
uncertainty
about
trump
s
future
policies
tillerson
s
departure
has
left
some
worrying
that
it
provides
a
green
light
to
those
in
the
office
pushing
for
more
protectionist
measures
analysts
at
anz
bank
said
in
a
note
to
clients
protectionism
is
on
the
since
trump
took
office
in
as
many
as
senior
officials
from
his
administration
have
walked
out
including
tillerson
according
to
citi
separately
trump
is
looking
to
impose
tariffs
on
up
to
billion
of
chinese
imports

as

down

a
trade
war
is
the
main
risk
said
amp
chief
economist
shane
oliver
a
global
trade
war
is
unlikely
but
there
may
not
be
much
peace
on
the
trade
front
investors
suspect
policymakers
who
favour
protectionism
will
also
seek
to
use
the
currency
as
a
trade
weapon
if
not
overtly
then
through
benign
neglect
as
news
from
the
united
states
dominated
investors
shrugged
off
stronger
than
expected
data
from
china
which
showed
the
country
s
industrial
output
expanded
at
a
surprisingly
faster
pace
at
the
start
of
the
year
fixed
asset
investment
also
handily
beat
forecasts
while
retail
sales
improved
from
december
tillerson
s
exit
and
the
potential
for
new
import
duties
on
china
coincided
with
subdued
consumer
price
data
on
tuesday
with
annual
core
inflation
at
percent
meeting
expectations
the
reading
should
have
been
positive
for
risky
assets
as
it
was
the
fear
of
a
in
inflation
and
faster
rate
hikes
that
had
hit
global
shares
in
early
february
many
traders
feel
that
equities
could
have
ended
higher
if
it
weren
t
for
rexit
analysts
at
citi
said
referring
to
tillerson
s
departure
tuesday
s
data
did
little
to
move
market
expectations
of
fed
rate
rises
with
an
increase
next
week
now
fully
all
that
put
together
meant
dollar
weakness
across
a
basket
of
currencies
it
eased
percent
to
yen
the
yen
did
dip
briefly
after
minutes
of
the
bank
of
japan
s
january
meeting
showed
most
policymakers
shared
the
view
that
the
central
bank
should
persistently
pursue
powerful
monetary
easing
the
euro
rose
overnight
to
edge
towards
a
recent

the

firmer
