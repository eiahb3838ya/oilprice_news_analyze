the

producer
wants
to
end
a
global
supply
glut
and
boost
prices
saudi
arabia
the
world
s
biggest
oil
exporter
has
been
pumping
below
its
opec
target
since
january
and
reducing
its
crude
shipments
particularly
to
the
united
states
as
it
turns
its
focus
on
cutting
exports
in
an
attempt
to
drain
global
oil
stocks
despite
nominations
coming
in
at
barrels
a
day
higher
than
the
previous
month
allocations
were
maintained
on
par
with
their
march
levels
the
ministry
said
in
a
statement
a
spokesman
for
the
energy
ministry
said
that
saudi
arabia
along
with
the
opec
and
oil
producers
participating
in
a
global
supply
cut
agreement
remain
committed
to
pursuing
the
common
objective
of
restoring
inventories
back
to
their
normal
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
producers
led
by
russia
have
agreed
to
maintain
oil
output
cuts
until
the
end
of
aiming
to
reduce
global
inventories
and
support
prices
opec
has
made
the
average
its
main
target
and
managed
to
reduce
the
glut
to
around
million
barrels
above
that
benchmark
from
above
million
when
the
cuts
began
in
opec
has
delivered
more
than
percent
of
the
output
cuts
that
members
pledged
under
the
deal
according
to
figures
from
opec
and
other
analysts
helped
in
part
by
an
involuntary
drop
in
venezuela
where
output
is
falling
amid
an
economic
crisis
we
are
happy
with
the
excellent
overall
conformity
levels
and
look
forward
to
all
participating
countries
maintaining
or
exceeding
full
conformity
with
their
commitments
as
agreed
the
saudi
energy
ministry
spokesman
said
but
the
relentless
rise
in
production
has
this
year
put
pressure
on
oil

also
increasingly
