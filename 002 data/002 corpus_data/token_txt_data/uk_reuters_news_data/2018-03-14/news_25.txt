u.s. energy pipeline developers to seek exemptions to steel tariff
reuters
energy
pipeline
developers
say
they
intend
to
pursue
exemptions
to
the
trump
administration
s
proposed
steel
tariffs
as
concerns
grow
for
those
companies
and
from
key
exporters
to
the
united
states
like
south
korea
we
have
a
number
of
pipeline
projects
that
would
be
impacted
significantly
by
this
cost
increase
said
adam
bedard
chief
executive
of
arb
midstream
an
energy
transportation
and
marketing
company
if
exemptions
become
available
we
d
certainly
try
and
qualify
for
he
was
referring
to
the
commerce
department
s
effort
to
devise
a
procedure
for
companies
to
apply
to
avoid
paying
a
percent
tariff
on
imported
steel
or
percent
on
imported
aluminum
commerce
has
days
to
come
up
with
the
procedure
to
apply
for
exemptions
from
the
steel
and
aluminum
tariff
declaration
issued
last
week
there
is
a
national
security
exemption
for
companies
to
buy
steel
items
that
domestic
manufacturers
do
not
produce
in
the
volumes
or
quality
required
the
president
also
said
exemptions
would
be
available
to
certain
countries
imports
account
for
percent
of
the
steel
used
in
pipelines
according
to
a
study
conducted
for
the
pipeline
industry
some
manufacturers
already
have
customers
waiting
two
years
for
pipeline
to
construct
lines
to
carry
shale
oil
and
gas
from
west
texas
fields
to
gulf
coast
export
hubs
energy
trade
associations
fought
for
a
way
around
the
tariff
they
argued
that
manufacturers
either
do
not
offer
key
metal
grades
or
diameters
or
have
long
production
times
that
would
impede
development
of
shale
oil
and
gas
pipelines
namerico
partners
lp
which
is
proposing
a
multibillion
dollar
pipeline
to
move
natural
gas
from
west
texas
to
the
gulf
coast
estimates
the
steel
tariff
would
raise
the
cost
to
its
customers
by
between
percent
and
percent
we
will
do
everything
we
are
capable
of
to
limit
the
impact
to
our
shippers
said
jeff
welch
the
company
s
managing
partner
namerico
has
not
yet
made
the
final
decision
to
begin
construction
of
the
kilometer
pipeline
he
said
even
with
exemptions
tariffs
could
still
raise
costs
and
slow
down
projects
said
nicolas
adrian
mctyre
an
austin
texas
attorney
and
former
trial
attorney
for
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
you
are
looking
at
a
new
regulatory
hurdle
potentially
and
there
are
a
lot
of
unknowns
to
that
process
one
of
the
primary
providers
of
steel
for
pipeline
companies
is
south
korea
manufacturers
there
have
said
they
are
considering
sending
exports
to
other
parts
of
the
world
due
to
difficulties
with
shipping
to
the
united
states
even
before
the
tariffs
go
into
effect
john
stoody
a
spokesman
for
the
association
of
oil
pipe
lines
said
at
least
one
member
firm
which
he
did
not
name
tried
to
buy
steel
from
south
korea
in
recent
days
but
was
rebuffed
due
to
tariff
uncertainty
foreign
pipe
sellers
are
hesitant
to
sell
pipe
he
said
executives
at
steel
companies
in
south
korea
say
the
move
is
nudging
them
toward
markets
seah
steel
whose
sales
to
the
united
states
account
for
percent
of
total
revenue
is
exploring
other
markets
a
company
official
said
trump
s
tariff
will
inevitably
impact
our
exports
and
make
it
necessary
for
us
to
find
a
new
channel
for
exports
the
seah
official
said
he
declined
to
be
named
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
matter
seah
acquired
two
plants
in
to
reduce
any
tariff
burden
according
to
the
company
but
still
has
to
rely
on
its
korean
manufacturing
lines
for
sales
the
commerce
department
said
in
april
that
it
had
found
that
korean
steel
producers
had
been
unfairly
dumping
octg
in
the
market
imports
of
oil
country
tubular
goods
octg
from
south
korea
which
includes
drill
pipes
casing
and
tubings
were
valued
at
about
billion
for
the
to
period
it
examined
that
accounted
for
nearly
percent
of
all
octg
imports
ahead
of
all
other
countries
commerce
said
at
the
time
commerce
responded
by
raising
duties
as
high
as
percent
from
a
previous
range
of
about
percent
to
percent
the
best
case
is
to
get
exempted
but
there
s
nothing
else
we
can
say
said
park
hoon
ceo
of
husteel
on
the
sidelines
of
a
meeting
between
korean
government
officials
and
industry
executives
to
discuss
the
tariffs
he
said
nearly
percent
of
the
company
s
business
relies
on
sales
and
the
company
also
is
looking
to
other
export
markets
