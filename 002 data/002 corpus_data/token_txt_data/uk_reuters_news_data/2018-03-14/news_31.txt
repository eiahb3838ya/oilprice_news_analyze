moscow
reuters
russian
gas
giant
gazprom
will
cut
hundreds
of
jobs
at
its
overseas
trading
and
export
offices
including
britain
and
move
them
to
st
petersburg
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with
the
plan
which
comes
at
a
time
of
rising
tensions
with
the
west
one
of
the
sources
said
the
decision
reflected
a
broader
trend
of
russian
state
firms
retreating
from
the
west
as
part
of
president
vladimir
putin
s
drive
to
repatriate
capital
to
reduce
exposure
to
sanctions
and
also
shore
up
the
domestic
economy
in
russia
this
story
can
be
sold
as
a
job
creation
exercise
on
home
turf
this
is
useful
especially
ahead
of
the
presidential
election
said
the
source
referring
to
the
vote
on
sunday
that
putin
is
widely
expected
to
win
the
reorganization
comes
as
relations
between
russia
and
britain
where
gazprom
has
the
largest
trading
office
by
far
have
hit
a
new
low
after
prime
minister
theresa
may
said
moscow
was
to
blame
for
the
attempted
murder
a
former
russian
double
agent
in
an
english
city
however
the
jobs
decision
was
taken
earlier
this
year
long
before
the
spy
scandal
erupted
according
to
the
sources
who
declined
to
be
named
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
matter
gazprom
which
has
its
headquarters
in
st
petersburg
said
it
was
too
early
to
comment
on
numbers
and
moves
the
company
last
month
that
it
planned
to
reorganize
its
overseas
trading
and
export
operations
but
gave
no
details
this
work
is
aimed
at
strengthening
the
company
s
position
abroad
a
spokesman
said
gazprom
s
overseas
trading
and
exports
divisions
employ
around
people
with
the
bulk
of
them
around
in
london
it
also
has
offices
in
locations
including
paris
houston
singapore
and
cities
in
germany
not
all
employees
are
traders
as
they
also
include
finance
and
logistics
specialists
the
reorganization
will
see
the
number
of
people
more
than
halved
while
about
the
same
number
of
people
will
be
hired
in
st
petersburg
from
where
many
trading
operations
will
be
executed
according
to
one
of
the
sources
who
did
not
give
more
specific
details
about
where
the
cuts
would
happen
since
setting
up
gazprom
s
trading
offices
in
london
in
gazprom
has
hired
dozens
of
top
traders
from
rival
companies
such
as
total
and
gunvor
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
from
ukraine
in
triggered
a
series
of
and
eu
sanctions
against
the
kremlin
and
its
companies
and
ties
have
worsened
further
after
russia
was
accused
of
meddling
in
the
presidential
election
russian
state
banks
such
as
vtb
and
companies
such
as
rosneft
have
since
scaled
back
their
presence
in
the
west
while
some
of
putin
s
closest
allies
such
as
businessman
gennady
timchenko
have
sold
their
assets
in
the
west
and
repatriated
capital
to
russia
the
west
has
repeatedly
accused
putin
of
using
gazprom
as
a
economic
and
political
weapon
after
the
gas
behemoth
cut
supplies
to
ukraine
thus
disrupting
deliveries
to
europe
moscow
denies
that
charge
europe
gets
a
third
of
its
gas
from
russia
and
gazprom
has
spent
years
on
building
a
mighty
trading
division
to
help
it
further
boost
that
share
the
plan
to
move
gazprom
s
trading
headquarters
from
london
to
st
petersburg
was
first
considered
by
the
company
s
management
in
but
it
was
put
on
ice
due
to
concerns
about
an
exodus
of
people
and
the
difficulties
of
raising
credit
for
a
operation
according
to
gazprom
sources
the
last
time
gazprom
s
marketing
and
trading
division
published
its
results
for
it
said
it
made
a
net
income
of
million
and
a
return
on
equity
of
percent
while
staff
costs
stood
at
million
