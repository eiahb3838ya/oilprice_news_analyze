shares
were
under
pressure
for
a
second
day
on
wednesday
and
the
dollar
held
near
lows
after
a
threat
by
president
donald
trump
to
slap
billion
in
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
rekindled
investors
concerns
about
the
economic
growth
outlook
equities
attempted
to
recover
after
tuesday
s
hefty
losses
heartened
by
robust
chinese
factory
data
with
s
futures
signalling
a
firmer
opening
for
wall
street
but
markets
struggled
to
overcome
fears
of
a
trade
war
and
political
uncertainty
after
trump
abruptly
sacked
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
the
tillerson
news
coming
days
after
the
exit
of
gary
cohn
a
strong
free
trade
proponent
had
sent
the
dollar
skidding
pushed
world
stocks
lower
and
bond
prices
higher
the
moves
accelerated
after
news
of
the
planned
tariffs
which
reportedly
target
chinese
tech
electronics
and
telecoms
all
this
is
creating
very
uncertain
times
for
markets
said
peter
lowman
cio
of
uk
wealth
manager
investment
quorum
the
fear
is
the
united
states
and
china
could
hurt
each
other
quite
badly
in
a
trade
the
events
pushed
wall
street
percent
lower
on
tuesday
filtering
through
to
asia
where
technology
shares
led
heavy
falls
the
negative
momentum
faded
somewhat
in
europe
with
a
equity
index
up
percent
after
it
fell
percent
on
tuesday
the
index
was
boosted
by
a
percent
jump
in
resources
stocks
which
benefited
from
the
chinese
data
as
well
as
a
share
buyback
at
german
sportswear
firm
adidas
that
left
msci
s
equity
index
down
only
marginally
its
second
day
in
the
red
and
off
highs
hit
before
news
broke
of
tillerson
s
sacking
his
departure
brings
to
the
number
of
senior
trump
administration
officials
who
have
left
citi
estimates
the
market
probably
correctly
viewed
this
move
as
weakening
internal
white
house
opposition
to
some
of
trump
s
less
policies
in
particular
the
president
s
trade
policy
daiwa
strategist
mantas
vanagas
said
the
dollar
has
been
another
casualty
though
it
swung
percent
higher
after
three
days
of
losses
treasury
yields
traded
just
off
lows
touched
earlier
in
the
session
german
government
bond
yields
approached
lows
and
stand
basis
points
below
this
year
s
peak
at
percent
the
trade
war
fears
at
least
temporarily
eclipsed
data
from
china
which
showed
industrial
output
expanding
at
a
surprisingly
faster
pace
at
the
start
of
the
year
fixed
asset
investment
also
beat
forecasts
while
retail
sales
improved
that
news
helped
brent
oil
futures
up
almost
half
a
percent
after
two
days
of
declines
while
copper
futures
jumped
almost
one
percent
morgan
stanley
analysts
said
the
data
suggested
that
some
losses
within
its
export
business
may
be
absorbed
by
strength
the
data
highlighted
the
relatively
robust
position
of
china
s
and
also
the
world
s
economy
the
latter
is
slated
to
grow
this
year
by
percent
according
to
the
international
monetary
fund
s
forecast
in
january
but
with
inflation
remaining
subdued
markets
do
not
see
interest
rates
rising
faster
than
currently
priced
while
european
and
japanese
rate
rises
remain
a
distant
prospect
while
a
rate
rise
next
week
is
already
priced
in
tuesday
s
data
showing
annual
core
inflation
steady
at
percent
did
not
persuade
markets
the
federal
reserve
would
raise
rates
more
than
three
times
this
year
that
along
with
the
trade
war
fears
is
keeping
the
dollar
from
strengthening
much
against
a
basket
of
currencies
it
failed
to
make
headway
against
the
yen
against
which
it
had
briefly
hit
highs
around
yen
the
developments
support
our
outlook
or
a
weaker
dollar
this
year
mufg
analyst
lee
hardman
said
referring
to
events
within
the
trump
administration
and
the
trade
fears
central
banks
in
japan
and
the
euro
zone
meanwhile
also
stuck
with
their
dovish
message
the
former
said
most
of
its
policymakers
believed
it
should
persistently
pursue
powerful
monetary
easing
the
euro
slipped
percent
against
the
dollar
inching
off
an
overnight
high
after
european
central
bank
president
mario
draghi
said
the
ecb
needed
more
evidence
that
inflation
was
rising
towards
target
he
warned
of
risks
from
possible
spillovers

the
