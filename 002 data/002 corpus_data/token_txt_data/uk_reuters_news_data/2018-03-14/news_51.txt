a

said
amp
chief
economist
shane
oliver
a
trade
war
is
the
main
investors
suspect
policymakers
who
favour
protectionism
will
also
seek
to
use
the
currency
as
a
trade
weapon
if
not
overtly
then
through
benign
neglect
as
news
from
the
united
states
dominated
the
market
shrugged
off
data
from
china
which
showed
the
country
s
industrial
output
expanded
at
a
surprisingly
faster
pace
at
the
start
of

fixed

handily
beat
forecasts
while

from

the
latest
chinese
economic
data
is
very
encouraging
said
craig
james
chief
economist
at
commsec
the
economy
is
well
placed
to
weather
any
increase
in
tariff
rates
in
fact
the
chinese
statistical
bureau
is
tipping
relatively
fast
growth
for
both
exports
and
consumption
in
still
investors
were
inconsolable
and
followed
overnight
losses
on
wall
street
with
the
dow
off
percent
the
s
p
down
percent
and
the
nasdaq
composite
falling
percent
the
selling
intensified
after
trump
dismissed
tillerson
following
a
series
of
public
rifts
over
policy
on
north
korea
russia
and
iran
he
was
replaced
with
loyalist
cia
director
mike
pompeo
the
move
comes
only
days
after
the
exit
of
white
house
economic
advisor
gary
cohn
who
was
a
strong
proponent
of
free
trade
tillerson
s
departure
has
left
some
worrying
that
it
provides
a
green
light
to
those
in
the
office
pushing
for
more
protectionist
measures
analysts
at
anz
bank
said
in
a
note
to
clients
protectionism
is
on
the
since
trump
took
office
in
as
many
as
senior
officials
from
his
administration
have
walked
out
including
tillerson
according
to
citi
tillerson
s
dismissal
and
the
risk
of
new
import
duties
on
china
coincided
with
subdued
consumer
price
data
on
tuesday
with
annual
core
inflation
at
percent
meeting
expectations
the
reading
should
have
been
positive
for
risky
assets
as
it
was
the
fear
of
a
in
inflation
and
faster
rate
hikes
that
had
hit
global
shares
in
early
february
but
the
inflation
data
did
little
to
move
market
expectations
of
fed
rate
rises
with
an
increase
next
week
now
fully
all
that
put
together
meant
dollar
weakness
across
a
basket
of
currencies
it
eased
a
tad
to
yen
the
yen
did
dip
briefly
after
minutes
of
the
bank
of
japan
s
january
meeting
showed
most
policymakers
shared
the
view
that
the
central
bank
should
persistently
pursue
powerful
monetary
easing
the
euro
rose
overnight
to
edge
towards
a
recent
top
