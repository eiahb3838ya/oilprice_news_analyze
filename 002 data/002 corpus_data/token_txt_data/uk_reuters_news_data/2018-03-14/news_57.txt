republicans
are
scrambling
to
avoid
a
political
embarrassment
in
a
conservative
district
of
pennsylvania
where
a
democrat
could
be
about
to
win
a
congressional
election
in
one
of
president
donald
trump
s
white
strongholds
democrat
conor
lamb
a
marine
veteran
and
former
federal
prosecutor
is
in
a
dead
heat
with
republican
state
representative
rick
saccone
in
tuesday
s
special
election
for
an
open
seat
in
the
house
of
representatives
that
republicans
have
held
since
the
race
is
seen
as
a
referendum
on
trump
and
a
harbinger
for
november
s
congressional
elections
according
to
pollsters
and
party
insiders
who
say
the
moderate
democrat
could
emerge
as
a
model
for
democratic
candidates
in
other
competitive
house
districts
that
trump
carried
in
the
democrats
have
nominated
the
ideal
candidate
because
he
fits
the
profile
of
the
electorate
if
they
d
nominated
a
liberal
who
allowed
the
campaign
to
become
nationalized
it
would
be
over
by
now
said
terry
madonna
director
of
the
franklin
and
marshall
college
poll
in
lancaster
pennsylvania
if
he
wins
or
even
if
he
just
comes
close
he
is
a
model
for
democrats
in
competitive
trump
districts
trump
won
the
district
in
southwest
pennsylvania
by
nearly
points
in
and
has
endorsed
saccone
the
economy
is
raging
at
an
all
time
high
and
is
set
to
get
even
better
jobs
and
wages
up
vote
for
rick
saccone
and
keep
it
going
the
president
tweeted
on
tuesday
still
lamb
has
fought
to
make
the
contest
a
local
referendum
and
said
he
was
focused
on
issues
in
his
district
even
as
he
welcomed
democratic
enthusiasm
over
the
race
this
is
a
local
race
lamb
told
reporters
after
voting
at
a
church
in
his
hometown
of
mt
lebanon
shortly
after
sunrise
on
tuesday
i
don
t
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
polls
closed
at
gmt
republican
dominance
has
been
so
strong
in
the
district
that
democrats
ran
no
candidates
in
the
previous
two
house
elections
even
though
state
voter
registration
records
show
democrats
outnumbering
republicans
but
dynamics
have
changed
in
the
district
which
runs
from
wealthy
suburbs
south
of
pittsburgh
through
hardscrabble
steel
and
coal
mining
towns
to
farmlands
along
the
west
virginia
border
saccone
a
conservative
who
has
described
himself
as
trump
before
trump
was
trump
led
the
race
by
more
than
percentage
points
in
january
the
contest
has
since
narrowed
to
a
on
a
wave
of
democratic
voter
enthusiasm
for
lamb
republicans
have
also
found
it
harder
than
expected
to
mount
effective
attacks
on
lamb
s
positions
on
abortion
guns
and
the
national
democratic
party
he
has
eschewed
the
national
democratic
brand
saying
he
would
not
support
house
democratic
leader
nancy
pelosi
as
speaker
lamb
says
he
personally
opposes
abortion
but
accepts
the
supreme
court
s
roe
wade
landmark
decision
allowing
abortion
as
the
law
of
the
land
he
favors
enforcing
existing
gun
laws
and
improving
the
current
system
of
background
checks
over
setting
new
gun
restrictions

a
young
new
guy
with
a

fresh
ideas
i

a
