china
s
economy
is
well
placed
to
weather
any
increase
in
tariff
rates
in
fact
the
chinese
statistical
bureau
is
tipping
relatively
fast
growth
for
both
exports
and
consumption
in
said
craig
james
chief
economist
at
commsec
the
data
highlighted
the
relatively
robust
picture
of
china
s
and
also
the
global
economy
the
latter
is
slated
to
grow
this
year
by
percent
according
to
the
international
monetary
fund
s
forecast
in
january
but
with
inflation
remaining
subdued
markets
do
not
see
interest
rates
rising
faster
than
currently
priced
in
while
european
and
japanese
rate
rises
remain
a
distant
prospect

a
rate
rise
by
the
federal
reserve
next

is
already
priced
in
tuesday
s
data
which
showed
annual
core
inflation
steady
at

did
not
persuade
markets
the
fed
could
raise
rates
more
than
three
times
this
year
that
along
with
the
trade
war
fears
is
keeping
the
dollar
from
strengthening
much
against
a
basket
of

failed

against
the

it

briefly
hit

around

central
banks
in
japan
and
the
euro

stuck
with
their
dovish
message
to

the
former
revealed
in
its
previous

minutes
that
most
of
its
policymakers
believed
it
should
persistently
pursue
powerful
monetary
easing
the
euro
slipped

against
the
dollar
inching
off
an
overnight
high
after
european
central

president
mario
draghi
said
the
ecb
needed
more
evidence
that

was
rising
towards
