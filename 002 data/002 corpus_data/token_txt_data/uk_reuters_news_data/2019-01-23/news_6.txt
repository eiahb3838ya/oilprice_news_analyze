update 1-norway gas to benefit from end to coal in germany - equinor
berlin
reuters
norway
germany
s
third
biggest
gas
supplier
after
russia
and
the
netherlands
could
make
further
inroads
into
the
german
market
as
the
country
phases
out
coal
a
top
executive
at
norwegian
oil
and
gas
firm
equinor
said
on
wednesday
i
m
sensing
that
there
is
going
to
be
an
increasing
demand
for
gas
in
germany
said
irene
rummelhoff
member
of
equinor
s
executive
committee
i
think
it
could
be
an
increasing
market
for
us
going
forward
she
told
reuters
at
a
german
industry
event
a
commission
comprising
politicians
researchers
and
lobbyists
has
been
tasked
with
setting
out
a
schedule
for
german
coal
mining
and
power
generation
on
friday
or
by
at
the
latest
this
comes
amid
a
push
by
germany
to
cut
emissions
in
coal
had
an
percent
share
in
german
power
generation
versus
just
percent
for
gas
the
commission
is
likely
to
propose
the
closure
of
half
the
nation
s
gigawatts
gw
hard
coal
and
lignite
fleet
by
the
quicker
the
of
coal
the
stronger
the
demand
for
gas
as
i
see
it
because
there
is
no
other
viable
alternative
rummelhoff
said
she
said
germany
could
not
run
on
renewables
alone
and
it
is
also
phasing
out
nuclear
power
by
while
gas
offered
steady
supply
at
half
the
emissions
of
coal
rummelhoff
also
saw
more
room
for
the
use
of
gas
in
home
heating
where
it
currently
accounts
for
around
percent
of
all
units
but
is
due
to
take
market
share
from
more
polluting
heating
oil
and
in
transport
the
heat
segment
is
very
dependent
on
gas
and
we
see
interesting
movement
in
the
transport
sector
such
as
in
public
sector
buses
she
said
germany
s
gas
strategy
is
important
for
norway
s
export
success
out
of
norway
s
pipeline
gas
exports
of
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
in
bcm
went
to
germany
figures
from
grid
company
gassco
showed
rummelhoff
also
said
she
was
a
little
puzzled
by
germany
s
plans
under
pressure
from
supplier
the
united
states
for
a
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
import
terminal
existing
terminals
around
europe
s
coasts
are
because
lng
is
more
expensive
than
pipeline
gas
but
traders
and
customers
at
the
conference
support
the
new
terminal
as
a
way
of
opening
up
more
shipment
options
and
boosting
liquidity
i
guess
the
rationale
would
be
to
have
more
diversification
rather
than
more
capacity
