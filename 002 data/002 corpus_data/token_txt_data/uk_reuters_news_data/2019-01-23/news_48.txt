japanese
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
said
on
wednesday
he
will
seek
to
use
his
chairmanship
of
the
group
of
leading
economies
to
rebuild
trust
in
the
global
trade
system
his
speech
to
the
world
economic
forum
in
the
swiss
alps
was
significant
at
a
time
when
a
bitter
trade
dispute
is
one
of
several
factors
threatening
to
bring
about
a
sharp
slowdown
in
global
growth
japan
is
determined
to
preserve
and
committed
to
enhancing
the
free
open
and
international
order
he
told
delegates
i
call
on
all
of
you
to
rebuild
trust
toward
the
system
for
international
trade
that
should
be
a
system
that
is
fair
transparent
and
effective
in
protecting
intellectual
property
rights
and
also
in
such
areas
as
and
government
with
the
french
british
and
leaders
cancelling
their
visits
because
of
more
pressing
concerns
at
home
abe
is
one
of
only
three
group
of
seven
leaders
attending
the
annual
event
in
davos
where
business
executives
are
worried
about
the
damage
that
populism
and
trade
protectionism
are
inflicting
on
the
global
economy
abe
said
japan
as
chair
of
this
year
s
gathering
of
the
group
of
will
also
seek
to
spearhead
discussions
on
climate
change
and
ways
to
facilitate
use
of
digital
data
while
protecting
intellectual
property
the
comments
underscore
japan
s
hope
to
rally
support
from
some
of
its
counterparts
in
pushing
for
a
multilateral
approach
in
solving
trade
frictions
that
could
help
tokyo
fend
off
pressure
from
washington
to
open
up
its
politically
sensitive
agriculture
market
and
take
other
steps
to
fix
bilateral
trade
imbalances
analysts
say
japan
has
to
be
consistent
on
the
need
to
promote
free
trade
and
shouldn
t
change
this
stance
even
if
the
united
states
is
always
talking
about
doing
a
bilateral
deal
said
takeshi
niinami
head
of
brewer
suntory
holdings
ltd
and
an
economic
adviser
to
abe
australia
singapore
and
other
partnership
tpp
countries
could
help
japan
make
free
trade
a
key
topic
of
debate
at
the
he
told
reuters
at
his
previous
davos
visit
in
abe
pledged
to
pull
the
economy
out
of
stagnation
with
his
abenomics
mix
of
fiscal
spending
monetary
policy
and
steps
to
boost
japan
s
potential
growth
via
labour
market
reform
and
deregulation
five
years
later
the
boost
to
growth
from
abenomics
is
fading
inflation
remains
far
below
the
bank
of
japan
s
target
and
critics
point
to
a
lack
of
progress
on
deregulation
abe
sought
to
counter
such
criticism
saying
that
through
policies
he
had
demolished
a
wall
of
despair
and
pessimism
on
japan
that
had
existed
five
years
ago
he
said
japan
hoped
to
build
a
consensus
on
the
need
to
reduce
plastic
waste
flowing
into
the
oceans
and
coordinate
on
global
usage
of
digital
data
without
infringing
on
personal
privacy
and
intellectual
property
i
must
say
that
spending
money
for
a
green
earth
and
a
blue
ocean
once
deemed
costly
is
now
a
growth
generator
he
said
decarbonisation
and
profit
making
can
happen
in
tandem
we
policy
makers
must
be
held
responsible
to
make
it
happen
as
i
will
be
stressing
in
osaka
this
people
close
to
the
premier
have
said
abe
is
keen
to
use
the
summit
in
osaka
western
japan
in
june
to
boost
his
poll
ratings
ahead
of
an
upper
house
election
looming
