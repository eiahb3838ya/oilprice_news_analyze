update 2-fujairah joins other ports to tighten exhaust rules ahead of 2020 fuel rules
singapore
reuters
fujairah
in
the
united
arab
emirates
has
become
the
latest
major
port
to
ban
a
type
of
fuel
exhaust
cleaning
system
to
comply
with
a
coming
tightening
in
rules
regarding
global
sulfur
emissions
mirroring
similar
moves
in
singapore
and
china
under
international
maritime
organization
imo
rules
that
come
into
effect
from
ships
will
have
to
reduce
the
sulfur
content
in
their
fuel
to
less
than
percent
compared
with
percent
now
forcing
huge
changes
upon
global
shippers
and
also
oil
refiners
fujairah
s
harbor
master
said
in
a
faxed
document
seen
by
reuters
that
the
port
has
decided
to
ban
the
use
of
scrubbers
in
its
waters
and
ships
will
have
to
use
compliant
fuel
once
the
imo
sulfur
cap
comes
into
this
follows
top
marine
fuelling
port
of
singapore
announcing
a
similar
move
in
november
while
china
banned
the
use
of
scrubbers
from
singapore
china
and
fujairah
marine
sales
volumes
represent
a
quarter
of
global
ship
refueling
also
known
as
bunkering
to
comply
with
imo
rules
shippers
can
switch
to
burning
cleaner
but
more
expensive
oil
invest
in
exhaust
cleaning
systems
known
as
scrubbers
that
may
allow
them
to
still
use
cheaper
fuels
or
redesign
vessels
to
run
on
alternatives
like
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
scrubbers
use
water
to
clean
up
fuel
emissions
preventing
them
from
being
released
into
the
atmosphere
scrubbers
are
the
cheapest
option
but
they
have
come
under
criticism
as
they
wash
heavy
metals
and
sulfur
from
the
waste
water
into
seas
instead
of
storing
it
for
a
controlled
discharge
in
ports
as
scrubbers
do
of
the
more
than
ships
that
have
so
far
opted
to
invest
in
scrubbers
around
have
installed
the
cheaper
type
shipping
sources
estimated
scrubbers
which
store
wash
water
for
later
discharge
are
still
accepted
in
most
ports
despite
the
spreading
bans
of
scrubbers
douglas
raitt
of
ship
classifier
lloyd
s
register
said
vessels
can
still
benefit
from
such
systems
as
they
can
pump
out
the
waste
water
in
open
seas
outside
a
port
s
jurisdiction
the
benefits
of
scrubbers
are
largely
realized
in
open
water
during
transit
from
one
port
to
the
next
he
said
ashok
sharma
managing
director
of
shipbroker
brs
baxi
in
singapore
said
the
bigger
ships
with
larger
fuel
consumption
on
long
haul
voyages
will
still
realize
substantial
savings
from
scrubbers
that
can
pump
the
waste
water
into
the
ocean
lloyd
s
raitt
said
shippers
should
also
consider
alternative
measures
to
prepare
for
imo
considering
that
when
the
new
rules
come
into
force
refueling
infrastructure
will
be
mostly
geared
toward
compliant
low
sulfur
fuel
oil
lsfo
rather
than
high
sulfur
fuel
oil
hsfo
prevailing
wisdom
would
be
for
operators
opting
for
scrubbers
to
have
a
meaningful
dialogue
with
their
supplier
base
to
secure
hsfo
in
ports
of
call
raitt
said
in
a
sign
of
how
the
industry
is
preparing
for
the
imo
change
sinopec
s
shanghai
refinery
has
produced
its
first
batch
of
bunker
fuel
totaling
tonnes
the
company
said
on
wednesday
sinopec
which
is
asia
s
biggest
oil
refiner
said
the
shanghai
refinery
was
the
first
in
china
to
produce
low
sulfur
fuel
oil
to
meet
new
imo
