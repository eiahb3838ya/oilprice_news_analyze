martin
neubert
told
reuters
the
business
is
generally
still
for
sale
there
are
better
owners
for
this
that
much
remains
clear

said
on
the

of
the
annual
handelsblatt
energy
conference
in

denmark
s
social

orsted
is
the
world

largest
offshore
wind
developer
with

and
under

neubert
said
that
while
two
major
wind
farm
projects
it
was
pursuing
in
taiwan
were
on
hold
for
now
the
country
remained
committed
to
offshore
wind
we
will
hear
more
about
this
within
the
next
eight
weeks
he
said
taiwanese
authorities
have
not
issued
permits
for
power
purchase
agreements
ppa
for
the
two
wind
farms
that
orsted
hopes
will
open
doors
to
more
work

also
optimistic
about

signed
a
memorandum
with
the
country
s
power
market
leader
tepco
to
work
jointly
on
offshore
projects
including
choshi
near

we
will
work
out
over
the
next
few
months
how
we
can
jointly
handle
planning
construction
operations

financing
neubert
said
in

orsted
as
a
strong
external
partner
neubert
said
as
for
germany
he
said
there
should
be
a
consensus
soon
for
how
to
expand
offshore
wind
after
we
are
falling
behind
comparable
european
markets
such
as
britain
denmark
and
the
netherlands
said
neubert

meanwhile
the

on
