said

adding
that
it
was
now
up
to
london
to
decide
what
it
wants
we
must
all
now
live
with
the
shock
that
britain
wants
to
leave
the
european
union
all
my
energy
and
thoughts
are
focused
on
achieving
this

us
to
have
a
good
partnership

merkel
said
adding
that
britain
had
much
to
offer
in
terms
of
security
and
defense
but
we
are
also
a
trading
area
and
the
closer
and
less
complicated
our
relations
are
the
better
but

is
now
