steen
jakobsen
chief
economist
at
denmark
s
saxo
bank
said
in
a
first
quarter
outlook
that
the
global
economy
is
suffering
but
added
that
china
s
government
will
do
all
it
can
for
stability
a
key
support
would
be
for
the
united

find
a
solution
to
their
bitter
trade
dispute
jakobsen
said
but
to
prevent
a
sharp
economic
slowdown
a
solution
needs
to
show
itself
before
the
chinese
new

should
a
deal
be
reached
by
then
we
will
see
powerful
support
for
the
chinese
economy

said
as
well
as
the
launch
of
strong
stimulus
programmes
to
keep
the
economy
growing
despite
this
jakobsen
warned
that
stimulus
programmes
could
not
keep
the
economy
going
forever
and
there
was
a
large
risk
of
another
downturn
