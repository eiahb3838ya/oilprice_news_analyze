russia
should
not
unleash
an
oil
price
war
against
the
united
states
but
rather
stick
with
output
cuts
even
at
the
cost
of
losing
market
share
in
the
medium
term
one
of
the
main
russian
architects
of
a
production
pact
with
opec
said
since
russia
and
opec
have
cut
oil
production
jointly
for
the
first
time
in
an
effort
to
boost
the
price
of
crude
following
their
supply
pact
oil
has
traded
between
roughly
and
per
barrel
from
below
before
the
deal
took
effect
for
shale
production
to
go
down
you
need
oil
prices
at
per
barrel
and
below
that
is
not
healthy
for
the
russian
economy
kirill
dmitriev
head
of
the
russian
direct
investment
fund
said
on
wednesday
we
should
not

to
destroy
shale
production
said
dmitriev
speaking
at
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
switzerland
three
years
ago
in
davos
dmitriev
became
the
first
russian
official
to
mention
publicly
the
possibility
of
a
supply
pact
with
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
at
that
time
oil
prices
had
collapsed
after
opec
kingpin
saudi
arabia
raised
output
to
hurt
producers
the
rise
in
prices
thanks
to
output
cuts
has
brought
roughly
an
additional
billion
in
revenues
to
russia
dmitriev
said
however
higher
oil
prices
have
also
helped
the
united
states
which
is
not
participating
in
output
cuts
the
country
s
production
has
rocketed
overtaking
that
of
russia
and
saudi
arabia
and
making
it
the
world
s
largest
oil
liquids
producer
production
is
expected
to
reach
new
highs
this
year
russian
president
vladimir
putin
will
visit
saudi
arabia
later
in
to
strengthen
cooperation
further
dmitriev
said
azerbaijan
one
of
the
largest
former
soviet
oil
producers
and
a
participant
in
the
production
deal
with
opec
believes
the
pact
should
be
extended
to
the
end
of
this
year
president
ilham
aliyev
said
this
week
such
a
move
should
keep
oil
prices
in
the
to
range
aliyev
said
this
story
was
refiled

of
