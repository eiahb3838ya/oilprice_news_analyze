china
s

in
december
soared
percent
from
the
same
period
a
year
earlier
to
a
monthly

of
million

customs
data
showed
on
wednesday
the
previous
record
of
million
tonnes
was
set
in
november
for
the
whole
of
imports
grew
percent
from
to
a
record
million
tonnes
according
to
the
data
from
the
general
administration
of
customs
that
saw
china
retain
its
position
as
the
world
s
buyer
of
the
fuel
after
japan
having
leapfrogged
south
korea
in
the
surge
came
after
gas
shortages
last
winter
prompted
chinese
companies
to
buy
supplies
ahead
of
this
winter
with
beijing
continuing
to
push
millions
of
households
to
shift
to
gas
from
coal
for
heating
but
analysts
at
ihs
markit
and
wood
mackenzie
are
forecasting
slower
growth
this
year
at
percent
as
the
government
move
to
a
more
moderate
stance
in
its
push
for
domestic
demand
the
focus
this
year
of
air
pollution
campaign
has
changed
to
clean
coal
rather
than
switching
said
lu
xiao
gas
analyst
with
ihs
speaking
before
the
customs
data
was
released
meantime
this
winter
temperatures
have
been
higher
than
normal
leaving
suppliers
with
hefty
inventories
dealers
said
there
had
been
backlogs
at
some
receiving
terminals
as
deliveries
were
particularly
strong
in
the
first
few
weeks
of
the
winter
heating
season
because
the
supplies
this
time
somehow
outpaced
demand
the
pressure
was
on
how
to
remove
the
surplus
an
official
from
a
state
oil
and
gas
importer
said
speaking
before
the
customs
data
was
issued
however
the
official
who
declined
to
be
identified
as
he
was
not
authorised
to
speak
to

said
that
oversupply
had
been
gradually
easing

the
country

largest

importer

to
resell
a

demand
cover
industry
sources
said
this
week
growth
in
appetite
for
lng
has
also
been
curbed
as
industrial
users
including
some
steel
mills
and
ceramics
plants
had
to
restrict
production
over
winter
to
meet
china
s
targets
meanwhile
china
s
gasoline
and
diesel
exports
last
year
both
hit
record
as
state
refiners
won
more
quotas
to
ship
surplus
fuel
for
the
whole
of
gasoline
exports
were
up
percent
from
at
million

in

stood
at
million

and
gasoline
exports
were
million
