crude
oil
production
will
continue
to
grow
through

but
at
a
much
slower
pace
than
in
according
to
the
latest
forecasts
from
the
energy
information
administration
crude
and
condensates
production
is
estimated
to
have
risen
by
almost
million
barrels
per
day
last
year
according
to
the
agency
the
largest
annual
increase
in
history
but
the

forecasts
growth
will
slow
to
just
over
million
barrels

growth
from
the
lower
states
excluding
federal

in
the
gulf
of
mexico
is

to
slow
even
more
sharply
from
almost
million

million

production
mostly
from
onshore

contributed
to
the
oversupply
which
emerged
in
the
oil
market
during
and
the
consequent
fall
in
prices
during
the
fourth
quarter
slower
growth
from
the
shale
plays
will
therefore
have
to
play
an
important
role
in
rebalancing
the
market
during
and
even
if
the
global
economy
avoids
a
recession
the
dramatic
fall
in
oil
prices
in
the
fourth
quarter
was
largely
driven
by
shale
production
surprising
to
the
upside
as
a
result
of
the
surge
in
activity
earlier
in
the
year
oilfield
services
firm
schlumberger
told
investors
last
week
the
shale
surge
combined
with
generous
waivers
from
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
exports
and
the
sharp
fall
in
global
equity
markets
created
a
near
perfect
storm
to
close
out
according
to
schlumberger
but
the
company
sees
a
more
balanced
market
ahead
as
sanctions
waivers
are
not
renewed
the
united
states
and
china
resolve
their
trade
differences
