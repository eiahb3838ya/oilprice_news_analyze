boys
played
and
chatted
on
a
rickety
wooden
ramp
under
a
baking
sun
in
west
java
while
just
below
their
feet
flowed
one
of
indonesia
s
most
horribly
polluted
rivers
clogged
with
hundreds
of
tonnes
of
smelly
trash
authorities
in
the
nation
of
million
are
battling
a
lack
of
recycling
culture
or
environmental
awareness
to
achieve
an
ambitious
target
of
a
percent
cut
in
marine
plastic
debris
by
despite
having
devoted
billion
a
year
to
the
task
every
time
it
rains
and
floods
the
whole
village
goes
down
to
help
with
the
trash
and
clean
the
river
said
marzuki
a
resident
of
tarumajaya
on
the
banks
of
the
pisang
batu
river
that
carries
along
waste
from
villages
upstream
we
never
get
tired
of
it
but
the
trash
never
stops
yet
the
river
is
just
one
of
many
thickly
carpeted
with
trash
formed
mostly
of
plastic
waste
of
which
indonesia
churns
out
about
million
tonnes
each
year
with
nearly
half
ending
up
in
the
sea
a
study
in
the
journal
science
showed
the
archipelago
of
more
than
islands
is
estimated
to
be
the
world
s
contributor
of
plastic
pollutants
in
the
oceans
after
china
the
study
added
even
though
we
ve
brought
an
armada
of
garbage
trucks
that
take
three
turns
every
day
the
reality
is
we
haven
t
cleared
even
half
of
it
said
suseno
the
village
security
chief
in
tarumajaya
as
java
struggles
with
its
rivers
the
resort
island
of
bali
this
year
banned
the
use
of
plastic
bags
by
large
supermarkets
and
grocery
stores
a
measure
it
aims
to
widen
to
smaller
shops
yet
that
caused
its
own
backlash
i
ve
seen
people
protest
because
they
didn
t
get
plastic
bags
after
they
shop
said
one
supermarket
shopper
thomas
wibowo
while
adding
that
he
understood
the
need
to
cut
back
but
if
we
are
suddenly
forbidden
from
using
plastic
as
indonesians
we
d
be
the
risks
to
marine
life
were
graphically
highlighted
last
november
when
a
dead
sperm
whale
on
a
beach
was
found
to
have
kg
of
plastic
waste
in
its
stomach
i
think
this
is
also
a
global
issue
not
just
a
national
problem
said
ida
bagus
rai
dharmawijaya
mantra
the
mayor
of
bali
s
capital
of
denpasar
i
ve
seen
that
a
lot
of
citizens
are
accepting
and
helping
of
this
movement
including
tourists
they
too
want
to
help
replace
plastic
