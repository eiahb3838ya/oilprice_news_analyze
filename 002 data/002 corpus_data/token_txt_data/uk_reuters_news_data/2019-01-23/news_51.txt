renewed
concerns
about
a
global
economic
slowdown
continued
to
sap
investor
appetite
for
assets
considered
risky
dragging
global
stocks
and
bond
yields
lower
on
wednesday
while
the
dollar
held
near
highs
trading
was
choppy
overnight
as
hopes
of
more
stimulus
measures
from
china
to
shore
up
economic
growth
clashed
with
worries
over
progress
between
washington
and
beijing
to
resolve
a
trade
spat
between
the
world
s
top
two
economies
msci
world
equity
index
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
was
down
percent
the
main
culprit
for
the
tone
this
morning
is
the
change
in
sentiment
around
trade
talks
that
seeped
into
asia
overnight
and
europe
this
morning
said
edward
park
deputy
chief
investment
officer
at
brooks
macdonald
the
mood
soured
overnight
after
a
report
in
the
financial
times
that
the
trump
administration
had
rejected
an
offer
from
china
for
preparatory
trade
talks
this
week
ahead
of
negotiations
scheduled
for
next
week
white
house
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
denied
the
report
helping
equities
pare
some
losses
though
the
fresh
concerns
about
relations
kept
share
prices
in
check
the
report
dented
hopes
for
a
thawing
in
trade
tensions
that
have
fuelled
a
rally
in
stocks
through
much
of
january
also
supported
by
a
more
federal
reserve
a
fresh
batch
of
disappointing
corporate
updates
from
european
companies
further
knocked
confidence
about
earnings
pushing
european
stocks
lower
for
a
third
session
the
pan
european
index
was
down
percent
with
bourses
all
across
europe
losing
ground
as
a
profit
warning
by
ingenico
sent
the
french
payment
group
down
over
percent
and
hit
the
whole
european
tech
sector
msci

p
the
nasdaq

the

all
posted
their
biggest
percentage
drops
since
on
tuesday
in
another
sign
of
risk
aversion
most
bond
yields
fell
after
the
bank
of
japan
set
the
tone
for
further
easing
by
warning
of
rising
risks
to
its
economy
ahead
of
thursday
s
european
central
bank
meeting
markets
expect
the
bank
to
acknowledge
growing
threats
to
the
economy
justin
onuekwusi
a
fund
manager
at
legal
general
said
central
banks
stimulus
unwinding
china
s
slowdown
the
broader
impact
of
trade
wars
and
populist
rhetoric
from
politicians
were
all
keeping
markets
on
edge
all
these
issues
have
an
impact
on
markets
every
time
you
have
an
increase
in
rhetoric
markets
react
it
feels
like
there
is
a
greater
political
risk
the
biggest
risk
is
that
as
you
see
markets
fall
confidence
drops
and
you
get
people
not
spending
which
becomes
the
probability
of
that
has
recent
data
all
pointed
to
a
rough
year
ahead
for
the
world
economy
home
sales
tumbled
percent
in
december
falling
short
of
the
weakest
forecast
to
their
lowest
in
three
years
compared
with
a
year
earlier
they
were
down
more
than
percent
for
the
first
time
since
house
price
increases
slowed
sharply
adding
to
evidence
of
a
further
loss
of
momentum
in
the
housing
market
canadian
factory
sales
and
wholesale
trade
both
slumped
more
than
expected
in
november
while
in
germany
a
survey
by
the
zew
research
institute
showed
morale
among
german
investors
improved
slightly
in
january
but
their
assessment
of
the
economy
s
current
condition
deteriorated
to
a
low
japan
s
exports
and
imports
also
fell
short
of
market
expectations
with
exports
posting
their
biggest
fall
in
more
than
two
years
the
dollar
held
near
a
high
after
the
bank
of
japan
left
monetary
policy
unchanged
as
expected
boosting
risk
appetite
and
sending
the
yen
lower
against
a
basket
of
other
currencies
the

was
trading
at
near
the
hit
in
the
previous
session
the

was
a
shade
lower
at
but
remained
in
close
reach
of
a
low
of
set
on
tuesday
weighed
by
recent
