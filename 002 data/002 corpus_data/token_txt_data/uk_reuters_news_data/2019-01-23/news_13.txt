china
s
economy
can
maintain
sustainable
rates
of
growth
despite
global
uncertainties
vice
president
wang
qishan
said
on
wednesday
days
after
the
world
s
economy
posted
its
weakest
expansion
in
nearly
three
decades
in
a
remark
apparently
aimed
at
the
united
states
wang
also
urged
countries
to
uphold
multilateralism
and
respect
the
independent
choices
of
each
other
on
technological
innovation
there
will
be
a
lot
of
uncertainties
in
but
china
s
economy
will
continue
to
achieve
sustainable
growth
wang
told
delegates
at
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
speed
does
matter
but
what
really
matters
is
the
quality
and
efficiency
of
our
economic
development
he
said
china
does
not
see
its
economic
expansionary
cycle
coming
to
an
end
wang
added
seeking
to
dispel
market
concerns
that
faltering
domestic
demand
and
bruising
tariffs
could
spark
a
major
slowdown
ahead
growing
signs
of
weakness
in
china
which
has
generated
nearly
a
third
of
global
growth
in
recent
years
have
fuelled
anxiety
about
risks
to
the
world
economy
and
overshadowed
the
gathering
of
business
and
political
elites
at
the
alpine
resort
now
we
do
face
a
lot
of
imbalances
wang
said
urging
countries
to
take
measures
to
combat
them
what
we
need
to
do
is
to
make
the
pie
bigger
instead
of
bickering
over
how
to
divide
it
he
said
his
comments
came
after
data
on
monday
showed
china
s
economy
cooled
in
the
fourth
quarter
dragging
growth
to
the
lowest
in
nearly
three
decades
and
pressuring
beijing
to
roll
out
more
stimulus
to
avert
a
sharper
slowdown
with
no
quick
end
in
sight
to
trade
frictions
chinese
finance
ministry
officials
said
on
wednesday
they
would
ramp
up
fiscal
spending
this
year
to
spur
growth
with
a
march
deadline
approaching
to
reach
an
agreement
or
risk
an
escalation
of
tariffs
on
another
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
the
two
sides
are
still
far
apart
on
key
structural
elements
critical
for
a
deal
the
united
states
for
one
accuses
china
of
stealing
intellectual
property
and
forcing
companies
to
share
technology
when
they
do
business
in
the
country
in
an
apparent
retort
to
such
accusations
wang
said
it
was
imperative
to
respect
national
sovereignty
and
refrain
from
seeking
technological
hegemony
interfering
in
other
countries
domestic
affairs
and
conducting
shielding
or
protecting
activities
that
undermine
other
countries
national
security
but
in
more
conciliatory
comments
he
said
the
two
economies
had
become
indispensable
for
each
other
and
that
confrontation
would
harm
both
sides
we
need
to
uphold
multilateralism
engage
in
extensive
dialogue
and
cooperation
based
on
mutual
respect
and
mutual
trust
and
jointly
build
a
system
of
rules
for
technology
wang
said
fang
xinghai
vice
chairman
of
china
s
securities
regulatory
commission
told
a
separate
seminar
he
was
hopeful
beijing
and
washington
would
reach
a
deal
on
trade
i
think
there
will
be
deal
president
donald
trump
measures
success
of
his
measures
by
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
dow
jones
average
fang
said
whenever
you
have
difficulties
in
trade
cognations
wall
street
stocks
fall
he
said
that
indication
is
so
strong
i
believe
it
s
in
the
administration
s
interest
to
have
