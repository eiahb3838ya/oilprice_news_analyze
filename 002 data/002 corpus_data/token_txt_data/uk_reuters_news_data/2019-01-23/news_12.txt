dealtalk-despite 60 pct support, canada's husky scrapped meg oil merger
manitoba
reuters
when
the
final
numbers
were
tallied
late
last
wednesday
for
husky
energy
s
hostile
bid
for
rival
canadian
oil
producer
meg
energy
husky
s
top
executives
learned
they
had
the
support
of
nearly
percent
of
meg
shareholders
people
familiar
with
the
situation
told
reuters
that
meant
they
easily
surpassed
the
percent
threshold
usually
needed
to
extend
their
offer
and
reach
the
mark
necessary
to
win
the
deal
on
thursday
morning
however
husky
walked
away
saying
it
had
insufficient
support
the
move
shocked
investors
analysts
and
meg
itself
it
is
usually
a
given
that
a
company
securing
such
significant
backing
would
extend
its
bid
buying
extra
time
to
drum
up
remaining
support
however
husky
in
a
statement
on
thursday
noted
two
negative
developments
since
it
made
the
offer
in
september
a
lack
of
progress
expanding
pipelines
in
western
canada
and
the
province
of
alberta
s
decision
to
order
production
cuts
to
drain
a
glut
of
oil
in
storage
the
company
has
nothing
further
to
add
spokesman
mel
duvall
said
on
tuesday
in
fact
the
deal
began
losing
its
financial
appeal
shortly
after
husky
made
the
offer
people
close
to
husky
said
by
last
wednesday
it
seemed
to
one
of
the
people
as
if
husky
was
hoping
the
bid
would
fail
the
economics
of
the
transaction
changed
very
materially
since
they
launched
the
bid
it
was
an
extremely
shrewd
move
by
husky
to
launch
the
hostile
offer
and
just
as
smart
to
let
it
go
said
an
energy
m
a
lawyer
who
declined
to
be
identified
because
of
his
ties
to
both
companies
crude
prices
have
dropped
some
percent
since
husky
launched
its
bid
worse
for
canadian
oil
producers
discounts
on
their
crude
reached
levels
less
than
two
weeks
later
as
pipeline
congestion
worsened
husky
whose
majority
investor
is
hong
kong
tycoon
li
was
largely
immune
because
it
owns
refineries
that
can
handle
all
of
its
own
crude
but
the
industry
s
crisis
pressured
alberta
premier
rachel
notley
to
order
mandatory
production
cuts
in
early
december
over
opposition
from
husky
and
a
couple
of
other
producers
husky
displayed
doubts
as
far
back
as
november
that
month
according
to
meg
it
did
not
take
up
meg
s
offer
of
signing
a
confidentiality
agreement
to
take
a
closer
look
at
the
target
curtailments
quickly
changed
the
economics
boosting
canadian
prices
and
diluting
a
major
advantage
for
husky
husky
s
upgrader
and
refineries
previously
insulated
it
nicely
from
deep
price
discounts
and
cheap
crude
fattened
its
margins
downstream
husky
s
refining
capacity
exceeds
its
own
heavy
oil
production
and
so
in
an
market
it
bought
cheap
barrels
from
competitors
with
nowhere
to
move
them
driving
up
husky
s
margins
said
steve
kallir
senior
analyst
at
wood
mackenzie
but
such
trades
became
less
profitable
as
canadian
prices
rose
and
the
appeal
of
buying
meg
s
oil
production
may
have
also
diminished
he
said
early
this
month
as
the
oil
industry
s
ground
shifted
with
alberta
s
curtailments
husky
chief
executive
rob
peabody
did
not
accept
an
invitation
from
meg
ceo
derek
evans
to
negotiate
a
friendly
agreement
according
to
meg
but
husky
s
change
of
heart
on
shifting
price
dynamics
does
not
satisfy
everyone
meg
s
assets
will
endure
for
decades
making
thinking
less
relevant
