reuters
petroleo
brasileiro
sa
has
rejected
the
most
recent
bid
by
an
eig
global
energy
firm
to
purchase
a
pair
of
oil
clusters
two
sources
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
potentially
derailing
a
major
divestment
late
in
the
process
ouro

oleo
e
gas
a
brazilian
energy
firm
backed
by
private
equity
firm
eig
entered
exclusive
talks
in
july
with
petrobras
as
the
oil
firm
is
known
to
purchase
its
pampo
and
enchova
clusters
at
the
time
the
fields
located
in
the
campos
basin
off
the
coast
of
rio
de
janeiro
were
seen
fetching
around
billion
petrobras
is
cutting
stakes
in
fields
to
focus
on
brazil
s
larger
deepwater
play
that
is
creating
an
opportunity
for
smaller
oil
companies
and
private
equity
firms
eager
to
extract
value
from
relatively
mature
assets
but
the
process
has
been
rocky
at
times
for
petrobras
the
collapse
or
delay
of
the
pampo
and
enchova
deal
could
hurt
its
bid
to
meet
an
ambitious
divestment
target
of
billion
over
five
years
with
combined
oil
production
of
about
barrels
per
day
pampo
and
enchova
is
the
largest
mature
production
asset
currently
in
petrobras
divestment
portfolio
in
december
petrobras
reopened
bidding
for
the
clusters
as
brazil
s
federal
audit
court
known
as
the
tcu
requires
for
most
petrobras
divestitures
under
the
final
rebidding
round
investors
can
submit
bids
of
varying
values
so
long
as
they
have
the
same
contractual
terms
as
the
winning
bid
in
the
original
round
ouro
preto
took
advantage
of
the
rebidding
process
to
cut
its
offer
due
in
part
to
a
drop
in
oil
prices
reuters
reported
in
december
however
petrobras
unhappy
with
ouro
preto
s
price
cut
has
rejected
the
consortium
s
updated
bid
according
to
the
sources
who
requested
anonymity
to
discuss
confidential
matters
eig
and
ouro
preto
declined
to
comment
petrobras
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
the
setback
underlines
the
slow
at
times
convoluted
process
surrounding
petrobras
divestments
which
have
often
frustrated
potential
buyers
the
next
steps
in
the
pampo
and
enchova
divestiture
are
unclear
one
of
the
sources
said
the
ouro
preto
consortium
may
try
to
come
back
to
the
table
to
resume
bilateral
negotiations
with
petrobras
should
petrobras
the
process
to
other
potential
buyers
or
open
a
fresh
bidding
round
it
could
create
an
opportunity
for
firms
like
trident
energy
backed
by
private
equity
firm
warburg
pincus
which
had
submitted
an
offer
for
pampo
and
enchova
during
the
original
bidding
round
in
trident
did
not
respond

a
