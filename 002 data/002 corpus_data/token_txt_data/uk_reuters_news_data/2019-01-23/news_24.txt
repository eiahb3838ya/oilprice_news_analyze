root and branch reform: swedish scientist makes fuel from tree waste
lund
sweden
reuters
might
tree
roots
twigs
and
branches
one
day
be
used
to
power
cars
that
s
what
a
swedish
researcher
is
hoping
after
developing
a
pulp
byproduct
that
on
a
modest
scale
does
just
that
chemical
engineering
scientist
christian
hulteberg
from
lund
university
has
used
the
black
liquor
residue
from
pulp
and
paper
manufacturing
to
create
a
polymer
called
lignin
after
purification
and
filtration
that
is
then
turned
into
a
gasoline
mixture
we
re
actually
using
the
stuff
of
the
wood
that
they
don
t
use
when
they
make
paper
and
pulp
it
adds
value
to
components
of
the
tree
he
told
reuters
in
environmental
terms
he
says
that
gives
it
an
advantage
over
other
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
a
lot
of
the
controversy
with
ethanol
production
has
been
the
use
of
feedstock
that
you
can
actually
eat
he
said
hulteberg
has
a
pilot
plant
in
operation
and
hopes
the
forest
fuel
will
be
available
in
service
stations
by
though
it
will
only
serve
a
fraction
of
the
demands
of
swedish
motorists
he
is
hopeful
that
along
with
other
renewable
products
under
development
it
could
help
wean
us
off
our
addiction
to
fossil
fuels
