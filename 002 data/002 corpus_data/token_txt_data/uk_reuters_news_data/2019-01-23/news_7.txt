update 2-barnier to uk mps: agree alternative to stop no deal
brussels
reuters
eu
negotiator
michel
barnier
warned
british
lawmakers
on
wednesday
that
their
disparate
efforts
to
amend
delay
or
thwart
brexit
will
see
britain
crash
out
of
the
eu
in
march
if
they
can
not
rally
behind
one
alternative
referring
to
parliament
s
rejection
of
a
negotiated
withdrawal
treaty
and
raging
debate
about
preventing
a
march
departure
without
a
deal
to
cushion
businesses
and
people
barnier
said
the
house
of
commons
faced
a
choice
there
are
two
possible
ways
to
leave
the
eu
he
told
a
gathering
of
business
and
labour
leaders
in
brussels
number
one
an
orderly
withdrawal
based
on
the
agreement
that
we
have
built
with
the
uk
over
the
last
months
number
two
a
disorderly
withdrawal
leaving
the
eu
without
a
deal
is
the
default
scenario
and
there
appears
to
be
a
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
to
oppose
a
but
opposing
will
not
stop
from
happening
at
the
end
of
march
to
stop
another
majority
will
have
to
emerge
said
the
former
french
minister
speaking
in
english
to
drive
home
his
message
to
british
politicians
referring
to
the
need
to
build
a
majority
behind
an
alternative
to
a
no
deal
he
added
this
is
the
objective
of
the
political
consultations
that
theresa
may
has
started
and
we
hope
sincerely
we
hope
that
this
process
will
be
prime
minister
may
has
said
she
will
seek
amendments
to
the
existing
deal
to
try
to
overcome
massive
resistance
even
within
her
own
party
but
some
of
her
own
conservatives
in
parliament
are
working
with
labour
opponents
to
pass
legislation
that
seeks
to
force
may
to
seek
a
delay
in
leaving
rather
than
exit
without
a
deal
asked
by
several
people
from
the
floor
of
the
conference
of
the
european
economic
and
social
committee
including
several
representatives
of
british
and
irish
businesses
if
the
brexit
deadline
of
march
could
be
put
back
barnier
was
cautious
he
noted
that
a
request
for
extension
to
the
deadline
under
article
of
the
eu
treaty
would
have
to
come
from
the
british
government
which
has
not
done
so
yet
it
would
then
have
to
be
approved
unanimously
by
the
other
national
leaders
if
this
question
is
presented
they
will
have
questions
for
the
british
government
what
is
it
for
what
is
the
purpose
for
how
long
barnier
said
referring
to
elections
to
the
european
parliament
in
late
may
he
also
said
any
extension
to
britain
s
membership
of
the
eu
should
not
disrupt
the
democratic
functioning
of
european
institutions
some
eu
officials
say
britain
might
have
to
hold
its
own
eu
legislative
election
if
it
is
not
leaving
by
july
barnier
restated
his
readiness
to
swiftly
revise
plans
linked
to
the
withdrawal
treaty
for
a
future
trade
pact
with
britain
if
london
changed
its
red
lines
may
rules
out
staying
in
a
customs
union
with
the
eu
while
labour
favours
that
a
customs
union
could
ease
problems
with
guarantees
on
the
irish
border
that
anger
many
british
lawmakers
though
barnier
again
stressed
that
while
it
did
not
expect
those
guarantees
to
be
used
the
eu
would
not
ease
its
support
for
ireland
