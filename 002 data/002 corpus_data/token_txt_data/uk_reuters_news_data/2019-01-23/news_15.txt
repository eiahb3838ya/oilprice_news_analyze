british
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
brexit
deal
could
be
reformed
to
make
it
acceptable
to
leave
lawmakers
in
her
party
who
object
to
proposals
on
the
irish
border
prominent
eurosceptic
lawmaker
jacob
said
on
wednesday
who
chairs
the
european
research
group
erg
was
among
conservative
lawmakers
who
voted
against
may
s
deal
when
it
was
overwhelmingly
defeated
last
week
but
he
said
he
was
more
optimistic
that
changes
might
be
made
to
the
deal
that
could
see
it
approved
by
parliament
i
think
at
last
things
are
going
our
way
i
think
there
is
good
news
for
us
to
hope
that
a
reformation
of
this
deal
could
be
achieved
that
could
make
it
acceptable
he
added
at
a
event
but
it
is
not
there
yet
and
until
it
is
people
like
me
will
vote
against
the
said
changes
to
the
deal
would
have
to
have
equal
legal
status
to
the
deal
itself
and
that
the
backstop
must
be
somehow
removed
or
nullified
to
win
his
vote
something
the
eu
has
repeatedly
said
it
is
unwilling
to
consider
if
may
is
able
to
achieve
that
and
win
the
support
of
the
erg
head
it
could
be
enough
to
persuade
large
numbers
of
other
eurosceptics
to
vote
for
may
s
amended
deal
and
unlock
the
stymied
brexit
process
said
attempts
under
way
in
parliament
to
take
the
exit
process
out
of
may
s
hands
and
delay
leaving
the
eu
were
a
threat
to
the
british
constitution
and
urged
the
government
to
do
what
ever
it
took
to
block
them
including
suspending
parliament
if
necessary
if
the
house
of
commons
undermines
our
basic
constitutional
conventions
then
the
executive
is
entitled
to
use
other
vestigial
constitutional
means
to
stop
it
by
which
i
basically
mean
prorogation

closure

parliament
