a
temporary
safeguard
to
avoid
erecting
a
physical
border
between
ireland
and
northern
ireland
after
brexit
would
serve
no
purpose
the
eu
s
chief
negotiator
michel
barnier
said
on
wednesday
in
an
interview
to
newspapers
le
monde
rzeczpospolita
and
luxemburger
wort
barnier
said
the
current
backstop
proposal
over
the
border
was
the
only
option
on
the
table
the
question
of
limiting
the
backstop
in
time
has
already
been
discussed
twice
by
european
leaders
this
is
the
only
possible
option
because
an
insurance
is
of
no
use
if
it
is
time
limited
