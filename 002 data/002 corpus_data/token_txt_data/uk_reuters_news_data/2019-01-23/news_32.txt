berlin
reuters
shares
in
rwe
germany
s
largest
power
producer
rose
almost
percent
on
wednesday
at
the
prospect
of
higher
compensation
should
power
stations
be
shut
down
early
a
draft
paper
by
germany
s
coal
commission
which
is
tasked
with
organising
the
exit
from
coal
showed
operators
of
power
stations
should
receive
compensation
for
early
closure
but
did
not
specify
the
size
of
payments
a
shut
down
date
is
due
to
be
settled
on
friday
the
draft
document
seen
by
reuters
said
a
mutual
agreement
between
the
government
and
the
plant
operators
including
rwe
and
uniper
was
the
preferred
option
the
commission
assumes
that
in
the
negotiations
with
the
operators
of
power
plants
the
entire
planning
period
up
to
will
be
settled
by
mutual
agreement
the
draft
said
if
such
an
agreement
can
not
be
reached
by
june
the
commission
will
recommend
a
regulatory
solution
including
compensation
payments
based
on
legal
requirements
it
said
while
no
figures
are
mentioned
the
commission
suggests
that
the
compensation
for
operators
should
be
based
on
payments
made
for
similar
cases
in
the
past
utilities
have
already
received
around
million
euros
million
per
gigawatt
to
idle
plants
and
put
them
into
a
strategic
reserve
if
true
this
would
imply
much
more
meaningful
compensation
for
rwe
than
we
currently
assume
jefferies
analysts
wrote
in
a
note
following
the
reuters
report
shares
in
rwe
were
the
highest
gainer
on
germany
s
index
shares
in
uniper
gained
only
percent
however
the
commission
consisting
of
politicians
researchers
and
lobbyists
is
expected
to
adopt
a
more
detailed
version
of
the
paper
on
friday
according
to
the
draft
fees
for
the
use
of
electricity
grids
should
be
reduced
for
both
industry
and
private
consumers
and
operators
of
power
stations
should
receive
compensation
for
early
closure
the
necessary
funds
must
be
made
available
by
the
state
to
finance
the
recommended
measures
there
will
be
no
surcharge
on
electricity
prices
the
paper
says
the
entire
is
to
be
reviewed
again
in
and
with
a
view
to
security
of
supply
prices
climate
protection
and
structural
change
