davos - total ceo says influx of u.s. oil exports could weigh on prices
paris
reuters
an
expected
increase
in
oil
exports
could
weigh
on
oil
prices
towards
the
end
of
the
year
the
chief
executive
of
french
energy
company
total
said
on
wednesday
speaking
to
france
s
bfm
business
tv
on
the
sidelines
of
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
pouyanne
said
there
were
many
factors
weighing
on
oil
prices
yet
a
key
one
was
related
to
the
situation
in
the
united
states
one
of
the
main
reasons
as
to
why
prices
were
expected
to
be
weak
was
because
in
the
united
states
a
major
oil
producer
a
good
part
of
its
production
was
not
being
exported
because
of
bottlenecks
at
the
pipelines
these
are
being
constructed
and
when
it
will
be
done
at
the
end
of
the
year
there
will
be
an
influx
of
crude
in
the
market
and
this
will
drag
prices
lower
towards
the
end
of
the
year
