oil
producers
sought
on
wednesday
to
soothe
opec
s
worries
about
losing
market
share
telling
the
group
that
investors
in
the
firms
wanted
a
reduction
in
growth
and
higher
payouts
the
organisation
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
allies
such
as
russia
have
cut
output
since
to
support
oil
prices
while
watching
producers
in
the
united
states
which
is
not
party
to
the
cuts
drive
up
production
the
united
states
has
overtaken
russia
and
saudi
arabia
to
become
the
world
s
biggest
crude
producer
output
is
approaching
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
opec
s
forecasts
and
even
government
predictions
have
repeatedly
underestimated
output
growth
the
bosses
of
firms
occidental
petroleum
and
hess
corp
attending
a
session
at
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
said
that
growth
of
shale
oil
output
would
slow
the
session
was
a
rare
occasion
when
producers
and
an
opec
representative
opec
mohammed
barkindo
sat
on
the
same
panel
i
believe
not
as
much
money
will
be
pouring
into
the
permian
basin
this
time
i
believe
investors
will
hold
companies
accountable
for
returns
and
a
lot
of
this
didn
t
happen
previously
occidental
chief
executive
vicki
hollub
said
echoing
her
comments
hess
corp
founder
and
chief
executive
john
hess
said
shale
production
now
accounted
for
about
percent
of
global
production
it
will
probably
go
up
to
percent
by
but
then
it
flattens
out
he
said
but
he
added
that
resources
would
start
to
degrade
shale
is
not
the
next
saudi
arabia
it
is
an
important
component
he
said
president
donald
trump
has
repeatedly
criticised
opec
for
manipulating
prices
and
demanded
several
times
last
year
that
the
group
bring
them
down
he
has
also
praised
opec
and
its
de
facto
leader
saudi
arabia
when
prices
have
fallen
oil
prices
surged
above
a
barrel
in
october
but
have
since
slipped
back
on
wednesday
brent
was
about
barkindo
said
opec
aimed
to
balance
supply
and
demand
and
had
helped
the
united
states
by
rescuing
its
oil
industry
from
oil
prices
the
oil
industry
is
under
siege
globally
barkindo
said
adding
that
opec
wanted
to
talk
more
regularly
to
producers
to
understand
their
industry
better
even
if
they
could
not
participate
in
any
production
cuts
in
response
hess
said
opec
plays
a
very
important
role
in
stabilising
the
market
and
those
efforts
need
to
be
fatih
birol
the
head
of
the
international
energy
agency
which
represents
industrialised
nations
said
most
forecasts
were
still
underestimating
oil
production
growth
there
is
a
huge
potential
in
the
birol
told
reuters
adding
that
the
united
states
could
raise
output
by
another
million
bpd
in
the
next
decade
