the
msci
global
stock
index
ended
wednesday
s
choppy
trading
session
with
a
small
gain
as
worries
over
politics
global
economic
growth
and
trade
tensions
were
countered
by
a
boost
from
quarterly
earnings
reports
however
the
dollar
and
oil
prices
declined
treasury
yields
climbed
but
analysts
expect
the
trillion
trillion
market
to
be
confined
within
a
tight
trading
range
due
to
a
dearth
of
fresh
economic
data
amid
the
government
shutdown
the
dollar
edged
lower
against
a
basket
of
currencies
as
uncertainty
over
trade
and
the
global
economy
clouded
the
greenback
s
outlook
and
restricted
it
to
tight
trading
ranges
against
other
major
currencies
the
trade
conflicts
and
tensions
the
government
shutdown
and
certainly
more
chatter
about
global
growth
in
those
are
the
factors
that
need
to
be
hashed
out
before
we
get
a
clear
direction
said
minh
trang
senior
currency
trader
at
silicon
valley
bank
in
santa
clara
california
after
falling
more
than
percent
in
the
previous
day
s
session
wall
street
indexes
strong
quarterly
reports
from
procter
gamble
comcast
corp
and
international
business
machines
helped
the
dow
show
the
biggest
gains
of
the
day
but
political
uncertainty
weighed
heavily
on
investors
white
house
economic
adviser
kevin
hassett
said
in
a
cnn
interview
the
united
states
could
see
zero
growth
in
the
first
three
months
if
the
partial
government
shutdown
is
extended
for
the
whole
quarter
what
we
re
seeing
here
is
a
very
indecisive
market
and
a
market
that
s
very
sensitive
to
headline
news
on
trade
and
the
shutdown
peter
cardillo
chief
market
economist
at
spartan
capital
securities
in
new
york
referring
to
hassett
s
comment
and
according
to
cardillo
it
didn
t
help
investor
mood
that
president
donald
trump
and
house
of
representatives
speaker
nancy
pelosi
argued
publicly
over
whether
trump
can
deliver
the
annual
state
of
the
union
address
in
the
house
chamber
during
the
shutdown
the
longer
the
bickering
goes
on
the
longer
the
shutdown
goes
on
and
everyone
gets
affected
if
the
economy
slows

trump
told
reporters
on
wednesday
that
the
united

was
doing
well
in

that
china
very
much
wants

he
would
not

his
position
that

must
make
real
