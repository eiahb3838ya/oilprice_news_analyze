asian
stocks
took
a
breather
on
wednesday
with
mounting
signs
of
slowing
global
growth
and
concerns
over
a
trade
dispute
putting
the
brakes
on
investor
appetite
for
risk
assets
msci
s
broadest

outside

was
mostly
unchanged

a

all
posted
their
biggest
percentage
drops
since
on
tuesday
following
a
sharp
drop
in
december
shares
gained
through
much
of
january
supported
in
part
by
expectations
for
a
thaw
in
trade
tensions
and
a
more
federal
reserve
that
also
prompted
global
investors
to
plow
into
riskier
assets
but
putting
a
dent
on
sentiment
again
was
a
report
by
the
financial
times
that
the
trump
administration
had
rejected
an
offer
from
china
for
preparatory
trade
talks
this
week
ahead
of
negotiations
scheduled
for
next

data
published
over

all
pointed

a

ahead
for

home

tumbled
percent
in
december
falling
short
of
the
weakest
forecast
to
their
lowest
in
three
years
compared
with
a
year
earlier
they
were
down
more
than
percent
for
the
first
time
since
house
price
increases
slowed
sharply
adding
to
evidence
of
a
further
loss
of
momentum
in
the
housing
market
canadian
factory
sales
and
wholesale
trade
both
slumped
more
than
expected
in
november
while
in
germany
a
survey
by
the
zew
research
institute
showed
morale
among
german
investors
improved
slightly
in
january
but
their
assessment
of
the
economy
s
current
condition
deteriorated
to
a
low
japan
s
exports
and
imports
also
fell
short
of
market
expectations
with

at

economic
data
has
been
weak
and
the
government
shutdown
should
be
hurting
economic
sentiment
but
even
that
has
been
considered
as
positive
for
risk

on
the
grounds
that
they
make
it
