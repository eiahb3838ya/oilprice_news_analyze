jan
reuters
germany
is
planning
to
protect
consumers
and
manufacturers
from
the
impact
of
abandoning
cheap
power
which
berlin
is
looking
to
ditch
for
environmental
reasons
according
to
a
government
body
s
draft
paper
the
coal
commission
which
is
tasked
with
organising
the
exit
from
coal
said
in
a
draft
document
seen
by
reuters
that
companies
and
private
households
should
be
spared
from
heavy
price
increases
the
commission
consisting
of
politicians
researchers
and
lobbyists
is
expected
to
adopt
the
paper
on
friday
when
it
will
also
decide
on
the
shut
down
date
for
the
last
power
plant
germany
according
to
the
draft
fees
for
the
use
of
electricity
grids
should
be
reduced
for
both
industry
and
private
consumers
and
operators
of
power
stations
should
receive
compensation
for
early
closure
the
commission
assumes
that
in
the
negotiations
with
the
operators
of
power
plants
the
entire
planning
period
up
to
will
be
settled
by
mutual
while
no
figures
are
mentioned
the
commission
suggests
that
the
compensation
for
operators
should
be
based
on
payments
made
for
similar
cases
in
the
past
utilities
have
already
received
around
million
euros
million
per
gigawatt
to
idle
plants
and
put
them
into
a
strategic
reserve
the
necessary
funds
must
be
made
available
by
the
state
to
finance
the
recommended
measures
there
will
be
no
surcharge
on
electricity
prices
the
paper
says
the
entire
is
to
be
reviewed
again
in
and
with
a
view
to
security
of
supply
prices
climate
protection
and
structural
change
