fukushima nuclear plant owner apologises for still-radioactive water
tokyo
reuters
the
owner
of
the
fukushima
nuclear
plant
destroyed
by
an
earthquake
and
tsunami
more
than
seven
years
ago
said
water
treated
at
the
site
still
contains
radioactive
materials
that
for
years
it
has
insisted
had
been
removed
the
admission
by
tokyo
electric
power
tepco
could
ruin
its
chances
of
releasing
the
water
into
the
ocean
a
move
the
nuclear
regulator
says
is
safe
but
which
local
fishermen
oppose
tokyo
won
the
bid
to
host
the
summer
olympics
more
than
five
years
ago
with
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
declaring
that
fukushima
was
under
control
in
his
final
pitch
to
the
international
olympic
committee
the
nearly
one
million
tonnes
of
stored
water
at
the
wrecked
plant
enough
to
fill
about
olympic
swimming
pools
still
contained
detectable
levels
of
potentially
harmful
radioactive
particles
tepco
told
a
government
committee
on
tepco
apologised
to
the
committee
under
the
ministry
of
economy
trade
and
industry
which
is
looking
into
ways
to
dispose
of
the
water
a
spokesman
at
tepco
confirmed
the
findings
and
the
apology
a
quake
and
tsunami
in
march
triggered
meltdowns
at
three
of
the
fukushima
daiichi
plant
s
six
reactors
spewing
radiation
into
the
air
soil
and
ocean
and
forcing
residents
to
flee
many
of
whom
have
not
returned
it
was
the
world
s
worst
nuclear
disaster
since
chernobyl
years
earlier
hundreds
of
deaths
have
been
attributed
to
the
chaos
of
evacuations
during
the
crisis
and
to
the
hardship
and
trauma
refugees
have
experienced
since
then
but
the
government
only
last
month
acknowledged
for
the
first
time
that
one
worker
at
the
plant
had
died
from
radiation
exposure
documents
on
the
government
committee
s
website
show
that
of
tonnes
of
water
held
at
fukushima
tonnes
or
percent
contain
higher
concentrations
of
radioactive
materials
than
legal
limits
allow
in
tonnes
of
treated
water
the
levels
of
radioactive
materials
are
more
than
times
government
safety
levels
radioactive
readings
of
one
of
those
isotopes
considered
dangerous
to
human
health
were
detected
at
becquerels
per
litre
in
some
tanks
times
the
legal
limit
tepco
has
for
years
insisted
that
its
purification
processes
remove
strontium
and
other
radioactive
elements
from
the
contaminated
water
but
leaves
tritium
a
mildly
radioactive
element
that
is
difficult
to
separate
from
water
tritium
is
regularly
released
after
dilution
in
normally
operating
nuclear
plants
we
will
filter
the
water
in
the
tanks
one
more
time
to
bring
the
levels
to
below
regulatory
limits
before
release
into
the
ocean
if
a
decision
is
made
to
do
so
the
tepco
spokesman
said
the
water
has
come
about
because
tepco
must
pour
water
over
the
three
reactors
to
keep
the
melted
uranium
fuel
at
a
safe
temperature
groundwater
flowing
from
the
hills
above
the
plant
enters
the
reactor
basements
where
it
mixes
with
highly
radioactive
debris
that
gets
pumped
out
and
treated
before
being
stored
in
tanks
that
are
fast
filling
up
and
a
costly
ice
wall
is
failing
to
keep
groundwater
from
entering
the
basements
a
reuters
analysis
of
the
tepco
data
showed
earlier
this
year
the
groundwater
seepage
has
delayed
tepco
s
and
may
undermine
the
entire
decommissioning
process
nearby
residents
particularly
fishermen
oppose
ocean
releases
of
the
treated
water
because
they
fear
it
will
keep
consumers
from
buying
fukushima
products
many
countries
including
south
korea
and
china
still
have
restrictions
on
produce
from
fukushima
and
neighbouring
areas
