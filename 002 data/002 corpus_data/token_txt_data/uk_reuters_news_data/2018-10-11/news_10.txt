belo
monte
hydro
dam
on
the
xing√∫
river
a
tributary
of
the

which

for
displacing
indigenous

and
causing

to
the
sensitive
biome
shelved
plans
for
other

in

could
also
be
revived
he
said
bolsonaro
easily
outpaced
his
leftist
rival
fernando
haddad
in
sunday
s
vote
taking
percent
compared
to
haddad
s
percent
but
short
of

help
build
the
infrastructure
brazil
badly
needs
ferreira
said
the
country
is
one
of
the
world
s
top
food
exporters
but
the
poor
state
of
roads
and
lack
of
railways
makes
getting
goods
to
ports
slow
and
expensive
popular
with
brazil
s
powerful
evangelical
and
farming
lobbies
bolsonaro
has
pledged
to
pull
brazil
out
of
the
paris
agreement
climate
deal
due
to
disagreements
over
how
the
amazon
should
be
protected
his
top
agriculture
adviser
nabhan
garcia
told

on
tuesday
that
bolsonaro
s
government
would
slash
fines
for
farmers
who
break
environmental
laws
in
sensitive
areas
like
the
amazon
rainforest
environmentalists
are
also
concerned
about
bolsonaro
s
plans
to
stop
recognising
new
native
reservation
lands
and
to
merge
the
agriculture
and
environment
ministries
under
the
control
of
a
farm
lobby
representative
garcia
a
conservative
voice
in
agriculture
in
brazil
had
been
floated
in
the
local
press
as
a
candidate
to
head
that
ministry
bolsonaro
said
on
thursday
that
garcia
would
not
have
that
post
without
elaborating
ferreira
said
hundreds
of
unfinished
infrastructure
projects
including
railways
and
roads
for
exporting
grains
will
be
studied
and
completed
if
viable
with
the
help
of
investors
through
partnerships
but
energy
will
be
a
priority
if
brazil
is
to
return
to
the
rates
of
growth
that
we
all
want
there
will
be
a
need
for
energy
that
can
not
be
supplied
from
other
sources
he
said
in
a
wednesday
night
telephone
interview
bolsonaro
said
on
thursday
that
his
team
had
an
economic
agenda
practically
ready
to
present
upon
taking
office
in
january
if
he
wins
including
a
tax
overhaul
that
would
not
raise
taxes
but
rather
cut
red
tape
ferreira
said
bolsonaro
favoured
privatising
the
transmission
and
distribution
units
of
brazil
s
largest
utility
centrais
eletricas
brasileiras
sa
known
as
eletrobras
but
retaining
state
control
of
power
generation
he
emphasized
that
a
bolsonaro
administration
would
focus
on
clean
energy
from
hydropower
to
wind
and
solar
and
that
environmental
concerns
would
be
given
full
ferreira
struck
a
less
moderate
tone
in
an
interview
published
on
thursday
by
newspaper
o
estado
de
where
he
described
environmental
regulators
as
a
nuisance
when
the
army
was
responsible
for
opening
up
roads
in
the
amazon
during
the
military
regime
trees
could
be
felled
without
permission
but
today
to
cut
down
one
tree
a
handful
of
people
will
come
and
bother
you
