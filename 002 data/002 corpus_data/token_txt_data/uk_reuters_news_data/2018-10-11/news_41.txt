said

an

at

consultant
on

street
the
s
s
sharpest
fall
since

wiped
out
around

as

on
fears
of

the

wednesday
with
a
loss
of
percent
and
the
nasdaq
composite
percent
while
the
dow
shed

the
blood
letting
was
bad
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
president
donald
trump
who
pointed
an
accusing
finger
at
the
fed
for
raising
interest
rates
i
really
disagree
with
what
the
fed
is
doing
trump
told
reporters
before
a
political
rally
in
pennsylvania
i
think
the
fed
has
gone
it
was
hawkish
commentary
from
fed
policymakers
that
triggered
the
sudden
sell
off
in
treasuries
last
week
and
sent
yields
to
their
highest
in
seven
years
the
surge
made
stocks
look
less
attractive
compared
to
bonds
while
also
threatening
to
curb
economic
activity
and
profits
the
shift
in
yields
is
also
sucking
funds
out
of
emerging
markets
putting
particular
pressure
on
the
chinese
yuan
as
beijing
fights
a
protracted
trade
battle
with
the
united
states
on
thursday
the
president
of
the
world
bank
said
he
is
very
concerned
about
trade
tensions
and
warned
of
a
clear
global
economic
slowdown
if
tariff
threats
escalate
china
has
suspended
approvals
for
an
overseas
investment
product
in
shanghai
and
has
asked
license
holders
such
as
jpmorgan
asset
management
and
aberdeen
standard
investments
to
be
low
profile
in
marketing
it
as
concerns
rise
in
beijing
over
possible
outflow
pressures
china
s
central
bank
has
been
allowing
the
yuan
to
gradually
decline
breaking
the
psychological
barrier
and
leading
speculators
to
push
the
dollar
up
to
at
gmt
the
onshore
yuan
was
trading
at
per
dollar
at
gmt
pips
weaker
than
the
onshore
close
of
wednesday
china
s
move
has
forced
other
emerging
market
currencies
to
weaken
to
stay
competitive
and
drawn
the
ire
of
the
united
states
which
sees
it
as
an
unfair
devaluation
the
yuan
has
already
weakened
significantly
to
offset
the
tariffs
announced
so
far
said
alan
ruskin
deutsche
s
global
head
of
fx
strategy
further
weakness
could
exacerbate
concerns
of
a
flight
of
capital
and
a
loss
of
there
was
also
a
danger
for
the
if
beijing
had
to
intervene
heavily
to
support
the
yuan
china
buying
yuan
and
selling
dollars
would
likely
entail
some
selling
of
treasuries
at
a
point
where
the
market
is
showing
some
vulnerability
and
could
be
very
vulnerable
to
signs
of
china
liquidation
added
ruskin
the
dollar
was
already
losing
ground
to
both
the
yen
and
the
euro
as
investors
favoured
currencies
of
countries
that
boasted
large
current
account
surpluses
the
euro
pushed
up
to
and
away
from
a
low
of
early
in
the
week
the
dollar
lapsed
to
yen
down
percent
and
a
telling
retreat
from
last
week
s
peak
that
left
the
dollar
at
against
a
basket
of
currencies
in
commodity
markets

to

any

edged

in

even
though
energy

worried
about
shrinking

from

the
