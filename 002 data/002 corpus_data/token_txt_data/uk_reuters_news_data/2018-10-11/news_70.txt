european
biofuel
producers
clamouring
for
used
cooking
oil
comes
as
eu
pushes
to
phase
out
fresh
vegetable
oils
in
fuel
has
unleashed
wave
of
demand

from

industry

once
surreptitiously
dumped
down
drains
in
the
dead
of
night
asia
s
used
cooking
oil
is
fast
becoming
one
of
the
most
commodities
in
europe
as
a
feedstock
for
biodiesel
aggressive
green
energy
targets
in
the
european
union
that
were
bolstered
further
this
year
are
pushing
fuel
makers
to
churn
out
biodiesel
containing
recycled
cooking
oils
and
fats
phasing
out
the
use
of
fresh
vegetable
oils
in
the
process
by
that
has
unleashed
a
wave
of
demand
for
used
oil
from
places
such
as
china
and
southeast
asia
where
cooking
oils
are
widely
used
to
prepare
everything
from
to
piping
hot
samosas
amizuri
abdullah

picks
up
used
oil
from
restaurants
fast
food
outlets
and
food
factories
for
malaysian
waste
oil
collection
firm
fathopes
energy
said
his
job
had
been
getting
markedly
busier
when
i
first
joined
the
company
a
year
ago
there
were
about
or
stops
to
make
in
a
day
now
there
can
be
as
many
as
and
more
people
are
asking
about
it
said
amizuri
who
wears
bright
blue
protective
gloves
to
pump
used
oil
into
a
tank
on
the
back
of
his
truck
on
the
outskirts
of
kuala
lumpur
the
oil
is
unloaded
at
a
collection
centre
where
it
is
filtered
to
remove
food
scraps
like
chicken
bones
and
skin
before
being
processed
to
reduce
contamination
it
is
then
transferred
into
tankers
for
export
to
europe
fathopes
chief
executive
vinesh
sinha
said
the
company
s
exports
of
feedstock
to
european
oil
majors
had
grown
percent
in
the
last
three
years
forecasting
a
threefold
increase
in
europe
s
demand
for
such
feedstock
by
used
cooking
oil
makes
up
a
good
chunk
of
what
the
company
collects
from
thousands
of
sites
across
southeast
asia
but
it
also
buys
coffee
grinds
animal
fats
and
palm
oil
mill
waste
my
clients
are
struggling
to
find
feedstock
in
anticipation
of
the
eu
policy
he
said
asia
s
used
cooking
oil
industry
was
estimated
to
be
worth
around
million
a
couple
of
years
ago
but
analysts
said
more
recent
estimates
were
not
available
due
to
the
rapid
growth
in
the
number
of
new
collectors
and
traders
justin
yuan
chief
executive
of
the
used
cooking
oil
division
at
chinese
consulting
company
stin
group
said
shipments
from
china
would
likely
hit
tonnes
this
year
up
from
tonnes
in
he
said
most
cargoes
go
to
europe
and
that
volumes
were
set
to
keep
surging
in
coming
years
more
overseas
biodiesel
plants
will
source
used
cooking
oil
in
china
with
soaring
demand
from
home
and
abroad
it
will
put
great
pressure
on
used
cooking
oil
supplies
yuan
said
the
competition
will
be
indeed
waste
oil
demand
is
already
outstripping
supply
around
asia
with
traders
estimating
that
the
premium
it
fetches
over
crude
palm
oil
prices
has
doubled
from
around
two
years
ago
to
stand
at
about
percent
used
cooking
oil
is
traded
at
prices
pegged
to
crude
palm
oil
typically
trading
at
a
premium
due
to
its
greener
credentials
traders
said
it
currently
cost
around
a
tonne
on
average
that
appetite
is
also
good
news
for
the
thousands
of
restaurants
and
other
businesses
where
the
used
oil
is
collected
which
typically
earn
around
cents
per
kilo
of
the
commodity
analysts
said
that
in
the
past
many
restaurants
and
food
manufacturers
poured
old
oil
down
the
drain
when
the
time
came
to
replace
it
often
breaking
rules
designed
to
protect
sewage
systems
that
are
very
difficult
to
enforce
mission
today
collectors
are
competing
to
lock
up
supplies
from
around
the
region
to
feed
expanding
biofuel
operations
in
europe
in
june
the
european
union
agreed
to
phase
out
crude
vegetable
oils
usage
in
transport
fuel
from
as
part
of
a
broader
plan
to
increase
the
share
of
renewables
in
the
bloc
s
energy
production
the
industry
here
in
asia
is
about
whether
you
have
the
capacity
to
get
more
oil
competition
is
very
fierce
now
so
the
margins
we
have
are
little

biofuel
producer
neste
told
reuters
by
email
that
it
was
planning
to
double
its

in

to
million
tonnes
all
that
means
that
amizuri
back
at
fathopes
energy
in
kuala
lumpur
could
be
set
to
get
busier
i
think
there
is
going
to
be
more
used
cooking
oil
collected
as
awareness
that
it
can
be
recycled
rises
i
think
this
industry
is
going
to
grow
he
said
instead
of
throwing
it
out
collect
and
sell
it
there
is
value
