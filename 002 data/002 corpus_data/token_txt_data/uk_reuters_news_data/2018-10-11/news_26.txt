new wind farms could thrive in norway without subsidies - state grid

declining
costs
and
rising
power
prices
mean
major
new
wind
farms
could
be
built
in
the
south
of
norway
without
subsidies
the
country
s
grid
operator
said
on
thursday
the
report
by
statnett
is
part
of
an
analysis
that
norway
s
energy
regulator
nve
is
putting
together
on
the
potential
for
increasing
the
country
s
wind
power
generation
which
currently
has
a
total
estimated
capacity
of
about
gigawatt
gw
the
development
of
increased
european
and
nordic
power
prices
combined
with
continued
declining
operating
and
development
costs
has
made
it
profitable
to
build
wind
power
without
subsidies
in
norway
statnett
said
the
analysis
said
a
large
amount
of
wind
power
could
be
generated
in
southern
norway
without
creating
new
bottlenecks
in
the
main
grid
however
statnett
added
that
without
significantly
higher
consumer
growth
and
possibly
more
network
capacity
northern
norway
and
the
northern
parts
of
central
norway
appear
less
favourable
for
further
wind
power
statnett
did
not
give
a
figure
for
the
amount
of
new
wind
capacity
that
could
be
built
norway
s
current
wind
capacity
is
behind
that
of
neighbour
sweden
although
several
wind
farms
are
being
built
there
is
currently
more
wind
power
under
construction
in
norway
than
is
in
operation
and
a
multiplication
of
wind
power
production
in
norway
is
expected
in
the
next
few
years
