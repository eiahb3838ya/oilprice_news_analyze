indonesia
wants
to
export
more
coal
in
order
to
earn
dollars
to
shore
up
its
faltering
currency
but
the
problem
is
buyers
don
t
seem
to
be
hearing
the
message
indonesia
s
coal
exports
dropped
to
million
tonnes
in
september
down
percent
from
august
s
million
tonnes
and
percent
from
million
tonnes
in
the
same
month
last
year
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
refinitiv
if
the
drop
isn
t
worrying
enough
it
comes
even
as
the
price
of
indonesian
coal
is
at
its
widest
discount
to
australian
thermal
coal
indonesia
is
planning
to
increase
its
output
of
coal
to
around
million
tonnes
up
from
a
previous
target
of
million
tonnes
the
aim
is
to
convert
the
additional
dollars
from
sales
of
the
polluting
fuel
into
rupiah
which
has
dropped
about
percent
so
far
this
year
against
the
currency
in
theory
importers
should
be
keen
to
ramp
up
purchases
of
indonesian
coal
as
the
massive
discount
to
australian
cargoes
more
than
compensates
for
the
lower
energy
value
the
price
of
thermal
coal
at
australia
s
newcastle
port
as
assessed
by
argus
media
was
a
tonne
in
the
week
ended
indonesian
coal
with
an
energy
content
of
kilocalories
per
kilogram
was
at
a
tonne
at
the
end
of
the
same
week
according
to
argus
this
represents
a
discount
of
a
tonne
the
widest
on
record
exceeding
the
recorded
in
november
according
to
the
argus
data
even
indonesian
coal
with
a
similar
energy
content
to
newcastle
is
trading
at
a
fairly
wide
discount
with
the
indonesian
government
s
reference
price
known
as
the
hba
set
at
a
tonne
for
october
graphic
the
hba
is
a
composite
price
made
up
equally
of
the
platts
kalimantan
assessments
the
coal
index
for
newcastle
export
index
of
and
the
globalcoal
newcastle
grade
of
in
effect
the
hba
index
sets
the
price
for
much
of
indonesia
s
thermal
coal
exports
and
its
discount
to
newcastle
should
provide
support
for
exports
from
the
southeast
asian
nation
indonesia
the
world
s
largest
exporter
of
thermal
coal
used
in
power
stations
has
two
major
customers
china
and
india
the
planet
s
two
largest
coal
importers
chinese
buyers
mainly
use
indonesian
coal
as
a
blending
feedstock
with
domestic
supplies
trading
off
a
loss
in
energy
value
for
lower
sulphur
and
ash
indonesia
s
exports
to
china
are
up
strongly
in
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
reaching
million
tonnes
percent
above
the
level
for
the
same
period
last
year
according
to
the
data
however
much
of
this
strength
was
in
the
first
quarter
of
and
september
marked
a
third
month
of
declining
imports
from
indonesia
china
imported
million
tonnes
from
indonesia
in
september
down
sharply
from
august
s
million
tonnes
making
it
the
weakest
month
so
far
this
year
the
news
on
india
s
imports
isn
t
quite
as
bad
for
indonesian
exporters
with
september
s
million
tonnes
down
slightly
from
august
s
million
tonnes
however
for
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
india
s
imports
from
indonesia
have
been
relatively
flat
dropping
fractionally
to
million
tonnes
from
million
in
the
same
period
in
what
may
be
worrying
for
indonesian
coal
exporters
is
that
their
rivals
seem
to
be
gaining
on
them
in
india
while
they
stand
still
india
bought
million
tonnes
of
coal
from
the
united
states
in
the
period
up
percent
on
the
million
tonnes
imported
in
the
same
period
last
year
from
south
africa
india
imported
million
tonnes
in
the
first
nine
months
of
up
percent
from
million
tonnes
in
the
same
period
a
year
ago
although
the
overwhelming
majority
of
australia
s
coal
exports
to
india
are
coking
coal
used
in
it
s
worth
noting
that
these
are
also
up
in
the
first
nine
months
of
climbing
to
million
tonnes
compared
to
million
tonnes
in
the
same
period
last
year
what
the
numbers
are
showing
is
that
indonesia
is
likely
to
struggle
to
ramp
up
exports
of
its
mainly
thermal
coal
as
there
doesn
t
seem
to
be
appetite
among
buyers
even
though
the
discount
to
fuel
is
as
wide
as
it
has
ever
been

opinions
expressed
here
are
