the
agriculture
department
surprisingly
trimmed
its
forecasts
for
both
domestic
corn
and
soybean
production
on
thursday
with
the
soy
cut
stemming
from
a
reduction
in
acres
while
the
corn
harvest
will
be
lower
due
to

soybean
production
was
seen
falling
from
the
government
s
september
estimate
due
to
a
decrease
in
harvested
acres
in
key
states
such
as
illinois
and
minnesota
despite
the
cuts
the
soybean
crop
was
still
projected
as
the
biggest
ever
while
corn
harvest
was
pegged
as
the

the
corn
crop
was
seen
at
billion

its
monthly

report
soybean
production
was

bushels
per

it
s
still
a
very
big
crop
said
bob
utterback
president
of
utterback
marketing
it
s
not
as
bad
as
we
thought
it
could
have
been
with
the
rain
delays
i
think
the
trade
is
going
to
take
the
attitude
that
yields
could
shift
down

analysts
had
been
expecting
corn
production
of
billion
bushels
with

soybean
production
of

yields

corn
led
the

rising

to
its
highest

in
more
than
seven

it
makes
you
wonder
what
happens
if
the

comes
down
even
more

with
the

that
we

got
