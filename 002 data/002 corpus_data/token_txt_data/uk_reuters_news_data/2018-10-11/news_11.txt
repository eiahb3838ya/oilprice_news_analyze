crews
to
relocate
pressure
sensors
during
pipeline
work
the
national
transportation
safety
board
ntsb
said
on
thursday
resulting
in
overpressured
lines
that
caused
explosions
and
fires
in
three
massachusetts
communities
last
month
overpressurized
gas
poured
through
columbia
gas
co
of
massachusetts
distribution
system
in
lawrence
north
andover
and
andover
flooding
into
homes
and
businesses
and
sparking
explosions
and
fires
that
killed
one
person
and
injured
critical
valves
controlling
the
gas
flow
were
not
shut
for
nearly
hours
after
the
first
alarm
was
raised
at
columbia
gas
s
monitoring
center
ntsb
said
in
a
preliminary
report
the
center
had
no
ability
to
remotely
open
or
close
valves
on
its
own
but
did
notify
technicians
it
added
nisource
is
fully
cooperating
with
the
ntsb
chief
executive
joe
hamrock
said
in
a
statement
on
thursday
however
it
will
not
comment
on
the
cause
of
the
incident
until
the
ntsb
completes
its
work
he
added
the
incident
raised
safety
concerns
about
the
sprawling
networks
of
aging
pipelines
the
september
explosions
and
fires
damaged
homes
and
businesses
as
columbia
gas
was
replacing
pipe
with
safer
plastic
lines
when
the
accident
occurred
the
ntsb
laid
out
the
timetable
of
events
in
a
dry
account
of
the
company
s
activities
that
day
crews
were
working
for
columbia
gas
in
lawrence
a
city
northwest
of
boston
to
replace
an
aged
main
with
a
new
plastic
distribution
main
line
the
abandoned
main
had
regulator
sensing
lines
used
to
detect
pressure
in
the
system
after
that
main
line
was
disconnected
the
sensing
lines
lost
pressure
and
the
regulators
fully
opened
allowing
the
full
flow
of
gas
into
the
distribution
system
supplying
the
neighborhood
the
report
said
columbia
gas
had
approved
a
work
package
that
did
not
account
for
the
location
of
the
sensing
lines
or
require
their
relocation
to
ensure
the
regulators
were
sensing
actual
system
pressure
according
to
the
ntsb
minutes
before
the
explosion
columbia
gas
monitoring
center
in
columbus
ohio
received
high
pressure
alarms
for
its
south
lawrence
gas
pressure
system
the
company
shut
down
the
regulator
at
issue
about
minutes
later
around
the
ntsb
said
september
s
explosion
was
the
largest
natural
gas
pipeline
accident
since
in
terms
of
structures
involved
eight
years
ago
an
interstate
gas
transmission
line
operated
by
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
ruptured
in
san
bruno
california
killing
eight
people
destroying
buildings
and
damaging
others
according
to
the
ntsb
columbia
gas
has
said
all
cast
iron
and
bare
steel
piping
in
affected
neighborhoods
will
be
replaced
with
high
pressure
plastic
mains
that
have
regulators
at
each
service
meter
