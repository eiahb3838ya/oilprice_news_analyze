profits
from
supplying
gas
and
electricity
at
britain
s
big
six
energy
firms
fell
by
a
combined
percent
last
year
as
they
lost
customers
to
smaller
rivals
a
report
by
industry
regulator
ofgem
said
on
thursday
earnings
at
britain
s
energy
firms
are
under
political
scrutiny
with
ofgem
set
to
impose
a
price
cap
in
time
for
winter
following
a
government
promise
to
tackle
prices
britain
s
big
energy
suppliers
are
also
facing
competition
from
more
than
smaller
challenger
firms
often
offering
cheaper
prices
ofgem
said
the
market
share
of
the
challenger
companies
had
risen
to
percent
by
june
up
from
percent
a
year
earlier
and
up
from
just
percent
around
six
years
ago
the
lower
customer
numbers
led
aggregated
domestic
supply
revenues
at
the
big
six
companies
to
fall
by
billion
pounds
billion
to
billion
pounds

said
in
its
annual
state
of
the
market
report
total
domestic
supply
profits
aggregated
across
the
six
companies
measured
as

the
first

the
report
said
ofgem
said
the
big
difference
in
margins
was
likely
due
to
varying
operating
costs
and
the
extent
to
which
costs
were
passed
onto
