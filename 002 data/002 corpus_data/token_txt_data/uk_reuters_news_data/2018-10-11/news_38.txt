rpt-tomato squeeze: us sanctions begin to distort iran's economy
reuters
tomato
paste
is
not
the
most
obvious
economic
indicator
but
in
iran
where
it
is
a
staple
that
some
people
have
started
it
says
a
lot
about
the
impact
of
renewed
sanctions
while
iran
makes
its
own
paste
from
an
abundant
crop
of
locally
grown
tomatoes
sanctions
reimposed
by
president
donald
trump
since
august
have
played
havoc
with
supply
a
percent
slide
in
the
rial
this
year
has
prompted
a
scramble
for
foreign
currency
that
has
made
exports
much
more
valuable
in
local
terms
than
selling
produce
at
home
some
shops
are
limiting
purchases
of
tomato
paste
which
is
used
in
many
persian
dishes
and
some
lines
have
sold
out
as
people
buy
up
existing
stock
the
government
has
responded
by
banning
tomato
exports
one
of
a
raft
of
interventions
to
try
to
limit
economic
instability
that
has
fuelled
public
protests
and
criticism
of
the
government
this
year
but
the
tomato
policy
is
not
working
an
industry
representative
said
tomatoes
were
being
smuggled
abroad
we
have
heard
that
trucks
full
of
tomatoes
are
still
leaving
the
country
especially
to
iraq
mohammad
head
of
the
syndicate
of
canning
industry
said
by
telephone
they
put
boxes
of
greenhouse
tomatoes
on
top
and
hide
normal
tomatoes
at
the
bottom
he
said
referring
to
an
exemption
for
grown
tomatoes
that
left
a
loophole
it
is
one
of
many
ways
in
which
the
sanctions
are
hurting
ordinary
iranians
while
benefiting
those
with
access
to
hard
currency
washington
reintroduced
steps
against
iran
s
currency
trade
metals
and
auto
sectors
in
august
after
the
withdrawal
from
a
deal
that
lifted
sanctions
in
return
for
limits
on
iran
s
nuclear
programme
trump
said
the
deal
was
not
strict
enough
with
curbs
on
iran
s
oil
exports
set
to
come
into
force
next
month
some
iranians
fear
their
country
is
entering
an
economic
slump
that
may
prove
worse
than
the
period
from
to
when
it
last
faced
major
sanctions
there
is
an
emerging
consensus
that
the
economy
will
go
through
a
period
of
austerity
similar
to
that
recorded
during
the
war
said
mehrdad
emadi
an
iranian
economist

analysis
at
london
s
betamatrix
consultancy
jumps
in
prices
are
occurring
in
a
range
of
goods
particularly
imports
such
as
mobile
telephones
and
other
consumer
electronics
but
also
some
staples
a
bottle
of
milk
rials
last
year
now
sells
for
an
can
of
tomato
paste
was
selling
in
tehran
stores
for
around
rials
in
march
it
is
now
rials
or
at
the
unofficial
rate
prompting
a
scramble
by
households
to
stock
up
the
price
of
tomatoes
has
increased
more
than
compared
to
last
year
signs
on
the
shelves
of
some
stores
limit
each
customer
to
two
cans
iranian
online
shopping
site
digikala
lists
the
top
nine
tomato
paste
items
as
out
of
stock
and
the
rest
as
coming
soon
in
supermarkets
in
najaf
in
neighbouring
iraq
meanwhile
supplies
of
iranian
tomato
paste
are
plentiful
adding
to
the
pressure
is
a
fourfold
rise
in
the
price
of
cans
said
traders
importing
material
to
make
cans
sought
to
buy
dollars
at
a
official
rate
of
rials
authorities
asked
them
to
use
a
more
expensive
rate
the
issue
has
delayed
shipments
of
material
to
factories
the
government
is
mounting
a
campaign
against
periodically
ordering
shopkeepers
to
sell
at
lower
prices
but
some
shopkeepers
respond
by
not
selling
at
all
believing
prices
will
eventually
rise
again
as
the
sanctions
bite
iran
a
big
oil
producer
with
a
diverse
economy
has
shown
its
farming
manufacturing
and
distribution
sectors
can
ride
out
long
periods
of
war
and
sanctions
the
tehran
stock
exchange
index
has
soared
percent
this
year
as
shares
of
exporting
companies
have
rocketed
urban
real
estate
prices
have
also
risen
as
iranians
plough
their
savings
into
property
rather
than
keeping
them
in
depreciating
rials
the
rial
s
plunge
which
in
the
unofficial
market
has
taken
it
to
around
against
the
dollar
from
at
the
end
of
according
to
currency
tracking
website
may
even
have
strengthened
the
financial
system
in
one
way
banks
and
pension
funds
have
been
struggling
with
massive
debts
emadi
said
the
rial
s
slide
to
as
low
as
in
late
september
had
given
the
government
huge
windfall
profits
on
its
dollar
holdings
authorities
appear
to
have
injected
some
of
those
profits
into
insolvent
banks
to
shore
them
up
he
said
but
while
official
data
for
the
last
few
months
has
not
yet
been
released
emadi
said
he
believed
the
economy
was
already
in
a
recession
that
could
deepen
in
coming
months
the
international
monetary
fund
predicted
this
week
that
the
economy
would
shrink
percent
this
year
and
percent
in
before
recovering
slowly
that
would
make
the
slump
less
deep
than
the
recession
of
when
the
economy
shrank
over
percent
and
not
nearly
as
damaging
as
the
war
of
when
it
shrank
by
about
a
quarter
the
imf
also
forecast
the
average
inflation
rate
would
jump
to
a
peak
above
percent
next
year
briefly
returning
to
its
level
in
how
much
the
current
recession
resembles
past
periods
of
economic
pain
for
iran
will
depend
on
the
extent
to
which
washington
can
use
the
sanctions
to
push
other
countries
into
cutting
oil
and
trade
with
the
islamic
republic
officials
have
said
the
sanctions
will
be
tougher
than
the
steps
in
they
aim
to
reduce
iranian
oil
exports
more
sharply
and
to
disrupt
exports
to
iran
from
trading
hubs
such
as
dubai
more
aggressively
i
think
the
return
of
the
sanctions
has
had
a
devastating
effect
on
their
economy
and
i
think
it
s
going
to
get
worse
trump
s
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
told
reuters
in
late
august
but
emadi
said
that
if
european
nations
succeeded
in
creating
a
special
payments
system
permitting
trade
with
iran
to
continue
and
if
tehran
cracked
down
on
endemic
corruption
the
economy
might
start
recovering
gradually
a
year
from
now
in
the
meantime
many
iranians
may
continue
to
struggle
with
surging
prices
and
an
unstable
currency
peyman
mohammadian
an
unemployed
university
graduate
in
the
western
city
of
andimeshk
said
he
had
tried
to
protect
billion
rials
in
savings
by
converting
them
into
dollars
last
month
at
a
rate
of
since
then
the
rial
has
partially
rebounded
as
authorities
have
sold
dollars
to
support
it
and
threatened
currency
speculators
with
arrest
mohammadian
said
this
left
him
in
a
quandary
on
one
hand
i
want
the
dollar
to
rise
so
i
don
t
lose
my
money
but
on
the
other
hand
i
want
it
to
drop
below
otherwise
inflation
will
be
so
high
that
i
won
t
be
able
to
get
married
for
for
a

versus
