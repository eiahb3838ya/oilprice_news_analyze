and
rio
de

at

dam
on
the
xing√∫
river
a
tributary
of
the
amazon
which
was
criticized

have
been
slammed
by
environmentalists
for
harming

bolsonaro
a
former
army
favored
by
financial
markets
fell
just
short
of
an
outright
majority
in

election
he
will
face
leftist
fernando
haddad
a
former
sao

powerful
evangelical
and

pull

out
of
the
paris
agreement
climate
deal
due
to
disagreements
over
how
the
amazon
should
be
protected
his
top
agriculture
adviser
told

that
his

would
slash

in
sensitive
areas
like
the
amazon
rainforest
ferreira
said
hundreds
of
unfinished
infrastructure
projects
from
railways
and
roads
for
exporting
grains
will
be
studied
and
completed
if
viable
with
the
help
of
investors
through
partnerships
but
energy
will
be
a
priority
if
brazil
is
to
return
to
the
rates
of
growth
that
we
all
want
there
will
be
a
need
for
energy
that
can
not
be
supplied
from
other
sources
he
said
in
an
interview
late
on

an
interview
posted

bolsonaro
said
his
team
had
an
economic
agenda
practically
ready
to
present
upon
taking
office
in
january
if
he
wins
including
a
tax
reform
that
would
not
raise
taxes
but
rather
cut
red
tape
ferreira
said
bolsonaro
favored
privatizing
the
transmission
and
distribution
units
of
brazil
s
largest
utility
centrais
eletricas
brasileiras
sa
known
as
eletrobras
but

struck
a
less
moderate
tone
in
an
interview
published
on
thursday
by
newspaper
o
estado
de
where
he
described
environmental
regulators
as
a
nuisance
when
the
army
was
responsible
for
opening
up
roads
in
the
amazon
during
the
military
regime
trees
could
be
felled
without
permission
but
today
to
cut
down
one
tree
a
handful
of
people
will
come
and
bother
you
he
told
the
paper
environmentalists
are
most
concerned
with
bolsonaro
s
plans
to
stop
recognizing
new
native
reservation
lands
and
to
merge
the
agriculture
and
environment
ministries
under
the
control
of
