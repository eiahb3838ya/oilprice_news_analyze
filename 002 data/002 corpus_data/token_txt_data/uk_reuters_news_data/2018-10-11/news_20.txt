a

under
which
moscow
has
been
sending
crude

and
oil
products
to
minsk
with
no
export
fee
belarus
then
some
of
those
goods
pocketing
the
associated
charges
russia
has
used
cheap
energy
exports
and
loans
to
belarus
as
a
way
of
keeping
its
former
soviet
neighbour
in
moscow
s
geopolitical
orbit
but
the
arrangement
has
become
harder
to
sustain
as
russia
s
budget
tightens
on
wednesday
russia
and
belarus
signed
amendments
to
intergovernmental
agreements
regarding
exports
of

oil

from
moscow
to
minsk
according
to
russian
energy
ministry
data
the
two
government
sources
told
reuters
that
exports
of
light
oil
products
such
as
gasoline
and
diesel
as
well
as
heavy
oil
products
and
lpg
also
used
in
the
petrochemical
industry
would
be
suspended
after
the
revised
agreement
the
sources
said
moscow
would
not
cut
exports
of
products
minsk
does
not
produce
itself
for
example
certain
oil
products
used
in
petrochemicals

of
the

said
exports
of
crude
oil
also
would
not
be
revised

ilya
dzhus

dmitry
kozak
who
oversees
the
energy
sector
in
government
dzhus
told
reuters
on
thursday
that
moscow
would
suspend
exports
of
heavy
oil
products
to
belarus
but
declined
to
elaborate
on
other
oil
products
moscow
supplies
belarus
each
year
with
around
million
tonnes
of
oil
products
but
wants
to
cut
that
to
tonnes
the
russian
finance
ministry
has
said
reuters
reported
in
july
that
belarus
often
seen
as
a
buffer
between
moscow
and
the
rest
of
europe
has
capitalised
on
a
general
aversion
from
trading
with
the
kremlin
to
become
the
largest
of
russian
lpg
