opec sec-gen questions "misguided" renewables debate after climate report
london
reuters
opec
s
on
thursday
criticized
a
report
calling
for
radical
action
to
fight
climate
change
saying
the
idea
that
renewable
energy
was
the
world
s
only
future
was
misguided
and
that
a
bombardment
of
green
advocacy
could
be
harmful
a
panel
this
week
called
for
unprecedented
changes
in
how
the
world
consumes
energy
and
a
dramatic
rise
in
the
use
of
renewable
power
to
contain
global
warming
and
protect
the
planet
from
heatwaves
floods
and
rising
sea
levels
we
have
significant
concerns
with
some
of
their
conclusions
not
to
talk
about
their
solutions
going
forward
mohammad
barkindo
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
told
an
oil
money
conference
in
london
the
past
years
have
been
the
warmest
on
record
since
the
when
measurements
began
according
to
scientists
who
attribute
the
temperature
rises
and
extreme
weather
mainly
to
greenhouse
gases
including
carbon
dioxide
from
fossil
fuels
such
as
coal
oil
and
gas
it
is
not
about
choosing
one
energy
source
against
another
as
it
is
being
suggested
by
some
of
our
colleagues
in
the
scientific
community
in
some
quarters
we
hear
stories
that
suggest
renewables
are
our
only
energy
future
this
with
all
true
respect
to
our
friends
is
clearly
misguided
he
said
the
report
said
renewable
energy
would
need
to
supply
percent
of
electricity
by
to
stay
within
a
degrees
celsius
limit
compared
with
about
percent
now
barkindo
said
a
bombardment
of
advocacy
for
alternative
energy
sources
was
impacting
sources
of
financing
and
investment
in
the
hydrocarbon
industry
with
potentially
dangerous
consequences
for
society
and
the
global
economy
to
contain
the
rise
in
global
temperatures
at
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
said
global
net
carbon
dioxide
emissions
would
need
to
fall
by
about
percent
by
from
levels
it
said
emissions
should
be
net
zero
by
oil
is
not
toxic
at
the
end
of
the
day
emissions
are
toxic
barkindo
said
adding
that
technologies
to
reduce
and
ultimately
eliminate
emissions
from
fossil
fuels
should
be
the
focus
of
attention
opec
raised
its
forecast
for
growth
in
global
oil
demand
last
month
it
now
sees
oil
consumption
reaching
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
up
million
bpd
from
last
year
s
report
oil
demand
is
expected
to
increase
by
million
bpd
to
million
bpd
