storm
clouds
were
building
over
the
global
economy
even
before
the
brutal

during
the
last
hours
escalating
oil
prices
rising
interest
rates
an
appreciating
dollar
and
growing
uncertainty
about
the
outlook
for
international
trade
are
proving
a
poisonous
cocktail
for
global
growth
and
have
been
triggered
crises
in
the
past
economic
growth
and
corporate
earnings
have
remained
strong
in
the
united
states
but
in
much
of
the
rest
of
the
world
momentum
has
been
slackening
since
the
start
of
the
year
strong
and
synchronised
growth
in
has
been
replaced
by
an
unbalanced
expansion
that
increasingly
relies
on
consumers
and
businesses
to
be
sustained
the

composite
leading
indicator
points
to
a
progressive
loss
of
momentum
in
the
advanced
economies
since
the
start
of
and
is
now
at
the
lowest
level
since
world
trade
growth
peaked
in
the
three
months
to
january
at

but
slowed
to
percent
in
the
three
months
to

south

a

proxy
for

peaked
at
the
end
of
october
and
has
since
fallen
to
a

air

are

more

these
indicators
are
all
correlated
closely
with
one
another
and
with
the
rate
of
expansion
in
the
world
economy
and
they
all
tell
a
consistent
story
of
slowing
momentum
outside
the
united
states
the
global
economic
expansion
shows
signs
of
increasing
maturity
with
unemployment

falling

in

of

prices
rising
oil
prices
have
risen
strongly
especially
when
expressed
in
terms
of
currencies
other
than
the

and
are
now
at
levels
that
have
preceded
recessions
in
the
past
for
countries
outside
the
united
states
the
global
economy
shows
signs
of
being
at
a
relatively
late
stage
in
the
cycle
and
policymakers
have
made
a
series
of
choices
that
have
complicated
the
outlook
still
further
in
the
united
states
the
combination
of
an
expansionary
fiscal
policy
tax
cuts
with
a
restrictive
monetary
policy
rising
interest
rates
is
causing
the
real
exchange
rate
to
appreciate
dollar
appreciation
is
worsening
trade
deficit
while
rising
interest
rates
are
increasing
costs
for
some
of
the
most
vulnerable
and
borrowers
in
emerging
markets
aggressive
sanctions
on
iran
are
reducing
global
crude
supplies
and
using
up
what
remains
of
the
industry
s
spare
capacity
intensifying
the
upward
pressure
on
oil
prices
proliferating
tariffs
are
increasing
costs
for
businesses
and
sowing
uncertainty
about
the
future
of
global
supply
chains
which
will
likely
cause
a
pause
in
investment
intensifying
superpower
competition
between
the
united
states
and
china
has
led
to
growing
concerns
about
national
security
and
the
proliferation
of
trade
and
investment
restrictions
national
security
officials
have
increasingly
become
more
influential
than
officials
in
many
countries
reversing
the
balance
of
power
that
had
prevailed
for
much
of
the
previous
years
sanctions
policies
have
disrupted
supply
chains
from
oil
and
aluminium
to
electronics
and
telecommunications
equipment
the
political
environment
for
business
has
turned
much
more
uncertain
with
increasing
country
risk
and
weakening
commitment
to
a
international
order
as
the
global
economic
expansion
has
become
longer
and
memories
of
the
downturn
have
faded
policymakers
have
started
to
take
it
for
granted
and
adopted
policies
that
put
it
at
increasing
risk
there
is
a
significant
possibility
that
the
global
economy
experiences
either
a
gradual
slowdown
or
an
outright
recession
before
the
end
of
slower
growth
in
economic
activity
may
be
needed
to
ease
some
of
the
pressure
on
oil
supplies
and
in
other
parts
of
the
supply
chain
crucially
the
threat
of
slower
growth
might
concentrate
the
minds
of
policymakers
on
the
need
to
provide
a
more
predictable
and
supportive
environment
for
growth
