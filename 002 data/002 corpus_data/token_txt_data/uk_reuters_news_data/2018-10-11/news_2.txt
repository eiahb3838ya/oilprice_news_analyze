opec
sees
the
oil
market
as
well
supplied
and
is
wary
of
creating
a
glut
next
year
the
group
s
said
on
thursday
suggesting
producers
are
in
no
rush
to
expand
a
june
agreement
that
raises
output
oil
prices
have
rallied
this
year
on
expectations
that
sanctions
on
iran
will
strain
supplies
by
lowering
shipments
from
opec

oil
producer
brent
crude
last
week
reached
the
highest
since
opec
mohammad
barkindo
speaking
at
the
oil
money
conference
in
london
said
there
were
many
factors
influencing
the
oil
market
that
were
beyond
oil
producers
control
the
market
has
been
reacting
to
perceptions
of
a
possible
supply
shortage
the
market
remains
well
supplied

the
projections

possible
rebuild

he
said
of
the
supply
and
demand
balance
for
next
year
opec
separately
updated
its
oil
supply
and
demand
forecasts
on
thursday
cutting
demand
estimates
for
next
year
due
to
economic
challenges
such
as
trade
disputes
and
volatile
emerging
markets
and
pointing
to
excess
supply
one
of
the
factors
boosting
prices
according
to
analysts
and
some
members
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
has
been
the
decision
by
president
donald
trump
to
reimpose
sanctions
on
iran
trump
has
demanded
that
opec
cool
prices
by
pumping
more
oil
barkindo
asked
whether
trump
s
criticism
of
opec
was
unfair
said
the
market
is
currently
being
largely
driven
by
decisions
taken
elsewhere
outside
opec
outside
opec
and
allied
producers
not
including
the
united
states
agreed
in
june
to
return
to
percent
compliance
with
output
cuts
that
began
in
january
after
months
of
underproduction
in
venezuela
and
elsewhere
pushed
adherence
above
percent
opec
s
report
said
its
own
production
rose
by
barrels
per
day
in
september
to
million
bpd
the
highest
this
year
although
producers
have
yet
to
increase
supply
enough
to
reach
percent
compliance
barkindo
responding
to
a
question
whether
producers
needed
to
go
beyond
full
delivery
of
the
agreement
said
they
were
taking
it
step
by
step
we
have
to
continue
to
assess
to
see
how
and
when
we
will
achieve
the
percent
conformity
and
how
the
market
would
respond
hoping
that
some
of
these
factors
will
evaporate
by
then
he
said
we
remain
faithful
to
what
we
agreed
in
opec
and
its
allies
hold
their
next
meeting
in
december
to
decide
policy
for
next
year
in
the
report
released
on
thursday
opec
cut
the
estimate
for
demand
in
for
its
own
crude
to
million
bpd
because
of
weaker
demand
and
rising
supplies
outside
the
group
should
opec
keep
pumping
at
september
s
rate
the
report
points
to
an
excess
supply
of
almost
million
bpd
in
although
this
is
before
any
sizeable
reduction
takes
place
in
iranian
output
iran
pumped
million
bpd
in
september
according
to
figures
in
opec
s
report
on
thursday
down
bpd
from
august
production
dropped
below
million
bpd
under
previous

that
were
lifted

oil
production
barkindo
said
oil
producers
were
worried
about
their
levels
of
spare
output
capacity
which
reduces
their
ability
to
make
up
for
sudden
supply
shortages
amid
a
reduction
in
investment
we
are
very
concerned
barkindo
said
when
asked
about
spare
capacity
citing
a
continued
decline
in
oil
industry
investment
resulting
from
a
market
downturn
that
began
in
saudi
arabia
the
de
facto
leader
of
opec
is
the
only
oil
producer
with
significant
spare
capacity
on
hand
to
supply
the
market
if
needed
the
kingdom
will
invest
billion
in
the
next
few
years
to
maintain
and
possibly
expand
its
spare
oil
production
capacity
