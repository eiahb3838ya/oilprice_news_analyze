update 1-britain can meet winter energy demand -national grid
london
reuters
britain
will
be
able
to
meet
power
and
gas
demand
this
winter
even
in
the
event
of
an
extreme
cold
snap
national
grid
said
in
its
winter
outlook
report
on
thursday
for
this
winter
even
under
colder
conditions
than
experienced
in
recent
years
we
are
confident
we
have
the
right
products
and
strategies
in
place
to
help
us
balance
the
gas
and
electricity
networks
national
grid
said
in
march
this
year
national
grid
was
forced
to
issue
a
gas
deficit
warning
for
the
first
time
in
eight
years
after
europe
was
gripped
by
a
cold
snap
dubbed
the
beast
from
the
east
and
after
several
pieces
of
gas
infrastructure
suffered
outages
national
grid
said
the
warning
had
the
desired
effect
encouraging
more
gas
to
come
to
the
market
and
demonstrated
that
britain
can
meet
its
gas
demands
from
a
variety
of
sources
even
if
there
is
an
extreme
event
total
gas
demand
is
forecast
at
billion
cubic
metres
this
winter
slightly
lower
than
last
winter
which
national
grid
said
was
due
to
lower
forecasts
of
demand
from
power
generators
as
global
gas
prices
have
risen
it
is
likely
that
coal
will
replace
gas
in
the
generation
merit
order
for
some
of
the
winter
the
report
said
national
grid
said
the
country
would
also
have
enough
electricity
to
meet
demand
this
winter
with
the
margin
or
surplus
power
margin
forecast
at
gigawatts
gw
gw
more
than
the
forecasted
margin
of
winter
electricity
demand
is
expected
to
peak
in
the
first
half
of
december
with
peak
demand
forecast
at
gw
wholesale
electricity
prices
are
likely
to
be
volatile
over
the
period
partly
driven
by
the
weather
dependency
of
renewable
generation
the
report
said
electricity
prices
in
continental
europe
are
likely
to
be
lower
than
in
britain
in
winter
meaning
national
grid
expected
to
see
a
net
flow
of
electricity
imports
into
britain
over
the
period
however
outages
on
the
belgian
nuclear
fleet
could
increase
continental
prices
and
create
some
uncertainty
on
interconnector
flow
direction
the
report
said
belgium
faces
an
unprecedented
power
shortfall
ahead
of
winter
with
only
one
of
seven
nuclear
reactors
scheduled
to
operate
in
november
which
provide
around
percent
of
the
country
s
electricity
britain
has
electricity
interconnectors
with
france
the
netherlands
and
ireland
