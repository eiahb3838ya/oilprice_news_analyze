after

suffered
its
worst
drubbing
in
eight
months
a
conflagration
of
wealth
that
could
threaten
business
confidence
and
investment
across
the
globe
it
also
raised
the
stakes
for
inflation
figures
due
later
on
thursday
as
a

would
only
stoke
speculation
of
more

summed

analysts
at

percent
to
its

japan
s
nikkei
sank
percent
in
early
trading
which
would
be
the
biggest
daily
drop
since
march
on
wall

the

suffered
its
biggest
fall
since
february
as
technology

tumbled
on
fears
of
slowing

the

with

percent
while
the

shed
percent
the
blood
letting
was
bad
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
president
donald
trump
who
pointed
an
accusing
finger
at
the
fed
for
raising
interest
rates
i
really
disagree
with
what
the
fed
is
doing
trump
told
reporters
before
a
political
rally
in
pennsylvania
i
think
the
fed
has
gone
it
was
hawkish
commentary
from
fed
policy
makers
that
triggered
the
sudden
sell
off
in
treasuries
last
week
and
sent
yields
to
their
highest
in
seven
years
the
surge
made
stocks
look
less
attractive
compared
to
bonds
while
also
threatening
to
curb
economic
activity
and
profits
the
shift
higher
in
yields
also
threatens
to
suck
funds
out
of
emerging
markets
putting
particular
pressure
on
the
chinese
yuan
as
beijing
fights
a
protracted
trade
battle
with
the
united
states
china
s
central
bank
has
been
guiding
its
yuan
steadily
weaker
breaking
past
the
psychological
barrier
and
leading
speculators
to
push
the
dollar
up
to
that
has
forced
other
emerging
market
currencies
to
weaken
to
stay
competitive
and
drawn
the
ire
of
the
united
states
which
sees
it
as
an
unfair
devaluation
the
yuan
has
already
weakened
significantly
to
offset
the
tariffs
announced
so
far
said
alan
ruskin
deutsche
s
global
head
of
fx
strategy
further
weakness
could
exacerbate
concerns
of
a
flight
of
capital
and
a
loss
of
there
was
also
a
danger
for
the
if
beijing
had
to
intervene
heavily
to
support
the
yuan
china
buying
yuan
and
selling
dollars
would
likely
entail
some
selling
of
treasuries
at
a
point
where
the
market
is
showing
some
vulnerability
and
could
be
very
vulnerable
to
signs
of
china
liquidation
added
ruskin
the
dollar
was
already
losing
ground
to
both
the
yen
and
the
euro
as
investors
favoured
currencies
of
countries
that
boasted
large
current
account
surpluses
the
euro
pushed
up
to
and
away
from
a
low
of
early
in
the
week
the
dollar
fell
back
to
yen
a
telling
retreat
from
last
week
s
peak
that
left
the
dollar
at
against
a
basket
of
currencies
in
commodity
markets
gold
got
a
modest
safety
bid
and
edged
up

skidded
in

even
though
energy

worried
about
shrinking
