french
wind
power
developers
could
increase
the
rate
at
which
they
add
capacity
and
boost
their
share
of
the
energy
mix
if
the
government
created
a
stable
and
simple
regulatory
environment
in
its

france
is
expected
to
unveil
the
plan
at
the
end
of
the

which
will
set
out
targets
a
timeline
and
energy
priorities
to
reduce
the
country
s
dependence
on
nuclear
electricity
and
increase
renewables
energy
the
government
has
received
proposals
from
industry
for
the
plan
known
as
ppe
to
cover
and
it
will
lay
out
how
and
by

generation
to
percent

olivier
perot
president
of
france
energie
eolienne
said
the
wind
sector
was
currently
adding
around
gw
to
gw
of
capacity
per
year
and
given
the
backlog
of
projects
it
could
hit
the
upper
end
of
the
target
and
add
up
to
gw
by
although
france
is
on
track
to
reach
its
target
of
gw
of
installed
onshore
wind
capacity
in
it
has
lagged
some
of
its
european
peers
such
as
germany
it
takes
around
six
to
seven
years
to
develop
a
wind
project
in
france
compared
with
half
that
time
in
germany
perot
told
journalists
that
germany
was
adding
around
gw
of
wind
capacity
per
year
he
said
the
sector
had
the
ability
to
add
over
gw
every
year
after
to
take
france
s
installed
onshore
capacity
to
gw
by
representing
around
percent
electricity
generation
it
also
has
a
target
for
gw
of
offshore
wind
in
which
could
reach
gw
in
for
this
to
happen
perot
said
the
industry
needed
a
stable
and
simplified
regulatory
environment
what
we
almost
need
is
a
sort
of
moratorium
on
regulations
he
said
a
scheme
was
announced
by
the
government
in
january
to
remove
administrative
hurdles
that
have
hindered
the
growth
of
france
s
wind
sector
and
halve
the
time
it
takes
for
projects
to
come
onstream
but
most
of
the
reforms
are
still
pending
said
pauline
le
bertre
a
senior
fee
official
she
said
measures
such
as
those
that
aim
to
reduce
the
time
it
takes
to
develop
projects
particularly
one
that
would
cut
length
of
time
it
takes
to
deal
with
appeals
against
projects
and
accelerate
the
administrative
procedure
have
not
been
taken
the
decree
is
being
finalised
and
we
hope
that
it
will
be
published
in
the
coming
weeks
