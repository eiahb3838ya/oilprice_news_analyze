interview-africa rebounding, but must prepare for future -imf official

africa
s
gdp
growth
is
rising
but
it
must
do
more
to
solidify
a
fragile
recovery
and
prepare
for
major
disruptions
in
the
global
economy
the
international
monetary
fund
s
top
official
for
africa
said
economic
growth
in
africa
is
on
track
to
hit
percent
this
year
up
from
percent
in
and
a
turnaround
from
the
commodities
crash
abebe
selassie
director
of
the
imf
s
african
department
told
reuters
it
could
quicken
further
to
percent
in
of
africans
live
in
countries
where
per
capital
gdp
fell
last
year
however
according
a
report
released
by
the
imf
on
thursday
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
other
major
economies
including
china
could
lead
to
a
cumulative
loss
of
gdp
for
africa
of
up
to
percent
by
and
africa
will
face
challenges
due
to
rapid
advances
in
artificial
intelligence
and
increased
automation
which
are
expected
to
shape
future
job
markets
if
you
are
not
equipping
your
labor
force
for
the
jobs
that
have
to
be
created
you
could
end
up
with
much
lower
growth
rates
and
that
s
what
we
re
worried
about
selassie
said
in
a
telephone
interview
africa
will
need
to
create
an
average
of
million
new
jobs
for
its
rapidly
growing
population
each
year
through
more
than
double
the
job
creation
rate
of
the
past
five
years
though
the
growth
rate
is
dragged
down
by
the
sluggish
performances
of
large
economies
like
south
africa
angola
and
nigeria
many
countries
are
seeing
robust
expansion
we
have
countries
that
are
growing
at
close
to
percent
or
more
and
quite
a
lot
of
others
in
the
or
percent
selassie
said
however
despite
pledges
to
reform
little
progress
has
been
made
to
improve
revenue
mobilisation
and
diversify
economies
to
make
them
less
vulnerable
to
future
crises
he
said
capital
inflows
to
africa
have
grown
exponentially
in
recent
years
but
there
too
risks
exist
much
of
the
increase
has
come
from
debt
liability
inflows
ballooned
from
billion
in
to
billion
last
year
selassie
said
we
are
very
very
careful
to
highlight
that
this
is
a
sword
he
said
a
very
healthy
stable
macro
environment
is
paramount
those
are
necessary
conditions
they
re
not
governments
must
also
promote
digital
connectivity
ensure
flexibility
in
their
education
systems
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
future
job
market
better
allocate
public
spending
and
nurture
private
investment
economies
can
potentially
benefit
greatly
from
new
technologies
that
are
already
transforming
the
continent
selassie
said
the
widespread
adoption
of
mobile
money
for
example
has
given
millions
of
africans
access
to
financial
services
for
the
first
time
but
an
enormous
amount
of
work
is
required
to
ensure
africa
is
not
left
behind
the
region
currently
has
the
lowest
internet
penetration
rate
in
the
world
at
less
than
half
the
global
average
secondary
education
enrolment
rates
in
africa
are
also
the
world
s
lowest
