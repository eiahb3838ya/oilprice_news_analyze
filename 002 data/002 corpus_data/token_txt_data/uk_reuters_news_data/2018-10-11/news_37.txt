german
consumers
who
pay
the
highest
electricity
bills
in
europe
are
likely
to
see
a
percent
drop
in
the
surcharge
they
have
to
pay
to
support
renewable
power
next
year
green
energy
lobby
group
bee
forecast
on
thursday
the
levy
is
a
key
part
of
germany
s
energiewende
policy
to
switch
to
less
environmentally
damaging
sources
of
energy
but
has
sparked
criticism
from
some
consumers
with
all
government
fees
now
accounting
for
over
percent
of
final
power
bills
the
surcharge
under
the
renewable
energy
act
eeg
could
fall
to
euro
cents
cents
per
kilowatt
hour
kwh
in
from
cents
in
bee
said
in
a
statement
it
gave
a
forecast
range
was
cents
germany
s
four
network
operators
tsos
which
collect
the
fee
are
due
to
announce
the
surcharge
next
monday
but
bee
s
predictions
have
in
the
past
been
close
to
the
outcome
the
fee
accounts
for
about
a
fifth
of
consumers
final
bills
explaining
the
expected
fall
bee
pointed
to
a
rise
in
wholesale
power
prices
which
has
allowed
renewable
producers
to
achieve
higher
revenues
and
so
rely
less
on
subsidies
indeed
the
funds
collected
to
support
green
electricity
are
expected
to
exceed
anticipated
payouts
next
year
even
though
an
increase
in
wind
and
solar
installations
will
raise
the
number
of
potential
recipients
for
subsidies
the
eventual
cost
depends
on
weather
patterns
which
determine
how
much
renewable
energy
is
generated
and
so
how
much
producers
can
claim
from
the
eeg
account
payouts
under
the
eeg
this
year
are
expected
to
amount
to
over
billion
euros
billion
according
to
industry
estimates
so
far
the
surcharge
has
only
fallen
twice
since
its
introduction
in
in
and
internet
portal
said
last
week
annual
power
bills
paid
by
german
households
had
risen
percent
to
a
total
of
billion
euros
the
wholesale
price
of
german
power
delivery
next
year
has
increased
by
percent
since
the
start
of
the
year
to
stand
at
