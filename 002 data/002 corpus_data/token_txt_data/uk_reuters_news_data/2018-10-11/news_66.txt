further

global

have
raised
the
stakes
for
inflation
figures
due
later
on
thursday
as
a
high
outcome
would
only
stoke
speculation
of
more
aggressive
rate
hikes
from
the
federal
reserve
we
re
all
just
watching
the
fed
we
re
all
watching
the
economy
we
re
worrying
about
an
inflation
spike
or
a
wages
spike
that
will
come
through
said
rob
carnell
chief
economist
and
head
of
research
at
ing
in
singapore
but
he
said
that
he
expected
the
data
to
show
inflation
peaking
rather
than
moving
sharply
higher
which
could
restore
a
little
bit
of
on
wall
street
the
s
s
sharpest
fall
since
february
wiped
out
around
billion
of
wealth
as
technology
shares
tumbled
on
fears
of
slowing
demand
the

p

wednesday
with
a
loss
of
percent
and
the
nasdaq
composite
percent
while
the
dow
shed
percent
the
blood
letting
was
bad
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
president
donald
trump
who
pointed
an
accusing
finger
at
the
fed
for
raising
interest
rates
i
really
disagree
with
what
the
fed
is
doing
trump
told
reporters
before
a
political
rally
in
pennsylvania
i
think
the
fed
has
gone
it
was
hawkish
commentary
from
fed
policymakers
that
triggered
the
sudden
sell
off
in
treasuries
last
week
and
sent
yields
to
their
highest
in
seven
years
the
surge
made
stocks
look
less
attractive
compared
to
bonds
while
also
threatening
to
curb
economic
activity
and
profits
the
rise
in
treasury
yields
has
been
the
primary
catalyst
for
the
in
equities
since
higher
yields
suggest
a
lower
present
value
of
future
dividend
streams
assuming
an
unchanged
economic
outlook
said
steven
friedman
senior
economist
at
bnp
paribas
asset
management
it
is
also
possible
that
equity
investors
are
growing
concerned
that
the
federal
reserve
s
projected
rate
path
will
choke
off
the
the
shift
in
yields
is
also
sucking
funds
out
of
emerging
markets
putting
particular
pressure
on
the
chinese
yuan
as
beijing
fights
a
protracted
trade
battle
with
the
united
states
on
thursday
the
president
of
the
world
bank
said
he
is
very
concerned
about
trade
tensions
and
warned
of
a
clear
global
economic
slowdown
if
tariff
threats
escalate
china
has
suspended
approvals
for
an
overseas
investment
product
in
shanghai
and
has
asked
license
holders
such
as
jpmorgan
asset
management
and
aberdeen
standard
investments
to
be
low

in
marketing
it
as
concerns
rise
in
beijing
over
possible

pressures
china
s
central
bank
has
been
allowing
the
yuan
to
gradually
decline
breaking
the
psychological
barrier
and
leading
speculators
to
push
the
dollar
up
to

the
onshore
yuan
was
trading
at

of
wednesday
china
s
move
has
forced
other
emerging
market
currencies
to
weaken
to
stay
competitive
and
drawn
the
ire
of
the
united
states
which
sees
it
as
an
unfair
devaluation
the
yuan
has
already
weakened
significantly
to
offset
the
tariffs
announced
so
far
said
alan
ruskin
deutsche
s
global
head
of
fx
strategy
further
weakness
could
exacerbate
concerns
of
a
flight
of
capital
and
a
loss
of
there
was
also
a
danger
for
the
if
beijing
had
to
intervene
heavily
to
support
the
yuan
as
it
could
lead
to
china
selling
treasuries
he
added
the
dollar
was
already
losing
ground
to
both
the
yen
and
the
euro
as
investors
favoured
currencies
of
countries
that
boasted
large
current
account
surpluses
the
euro
was
at
up
from
a
low

the

lapsed

telling
retreat
from
last

peak

left
the

at
