energy
companies
and
investors
are
focused
on
profits
and
reluctant
to
boost
spending
even
after
crude
prices
surged
to
highs
a
senior
goldman
sachs
banker
said
on
thursday
rattled
by
the
recent
downturn
in
the
sector
and
concerns
over
oil
demand
and
the
switch
to
renewables
big
oil
is
facing
an
unprecedented
challenge
we
re
firmly
through
that
survival
phase
and
the
better
capitalized
players
are
now
positioned
to
do
well
on
the
other
side
of
it
andrew
fry
global
head
of
energy
at
goldman
said
at
the
oil
money
conference
in
london
companies
typically
seek
to
increase
spending
as
they
emerge
from
a
downturn
in
order
to
capture
low
drilling
costs
and
an
expected
supply
shortage
but
this
time
round
the
barriers
for
investments
are
high
with
investors
seeking
returns
of
as
much
as
to
percent
from
dollar
oil
and
gas
projects
fry
said
in
the
near
term
the
focus
is
on
returns
as
opposed
to
growth
for
the
sake
of
growth
he
said
as
a
result
companies
are
currently
focusing
on
buying
back
shares
and
paying
dividends
to
investors
with
the
excess
cash
they
generate
for
the
first
time
since
the
downturn
the
oil
companies
now
have
their
balance
sheets
in
order
they
are
all
starting
to
think
about
growth
but
it
is
very
conservative
james
janoskey
global
of
oil
and
gas
at
jpmorgan
said
when
we
came
out
of
downturns
in
the
past
we
didn
t
have
energy
transition
issues
and
there
probably
wasn
t
that
much
pressure
from
capital
expenditure
among
the
world
s
top
oil
companies
is
expected
to
rise
to
billion
by
from
the
current
billion
but
will
remain
well
below
the
billion
before
the
oil
price
collapse
according
to
adam
brett
hsbc
global
head
of
natural
resources
advisory
that
means
oil
majors
will
show
very
healthy
returns
on
capital
invested
he
added
he
said
that
even
in
the
united
states
where
oil
output
has
resumed
spectacular
growth
on
the
back
of
high
oil
prices
large
companies
will
try
to
maintain
capital
discipline
and
focus
on
returns
rather
than
pure
production
growth
for
big
oil
value
will
prevail
over
volume
brett
said
adding
that
most
remuneration
reports
now
made
clear
that
top
executives
at
oil
majors
are
being
rewarded
for
delivering
robust
cash
flows
rather
than
production
increases
acquisitions
another
way
to
boost
production
and
reserves
are
also
expected
to
be
constrained
and
focused
energy
mergers
and
acquisitions
amounted
to
billion
last
year
and
stand
at
billion
so
far
this
year
said
brett
although
the
volume
of
m
a
has
been
relatively
stable
in
recent
years
the
structure
has
changed
since
china
largely
suspended
its
buying
spree
over
the
past
three
years
he
said
an
drive
and
revisions
of
overly
expensive
deals
have
prompted
china
to
cut
down
on
buying
resources
around
the
world
in
the
past
three
years
brett
said
that
m
a
were
currently
dominated
by
downstream
and
transactions
with
the
share
of
upstream
declining
to
percent
from
as
high
as
percent
when
china
was
an
active
asset
buyer
you
see
much
more
downstream
m
a
activity
and
i
expect
this
to
continue
in
the
years
ahead
