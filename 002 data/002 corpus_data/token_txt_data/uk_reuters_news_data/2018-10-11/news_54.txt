a
major
city
in
northern
china
s
shanxi
province
will
establish
zones
in
urban
districts
as
part
of
its
efforts
to
curb
pollution
the
provincial
government
said
on
thursday
the
shanxi
government
said
the
restrictions
would
cover
square
kilometers
square
miles
and
would
include
bans
on
the
storage
sale
and
direct

of
all
kinds
of
coal
power
and
central
heating
systems
will
still
be
permitted
it
said
households
in
datong
would
switch
to
cleaner
gas
heating
this
winter
and
that
it
had
already
demolished
boilers
datong
was
one
of
china
s
major
coal
producing
regions
for
decades
but
many
of
its
collieries
are
now
depleted
overmining
has
contaminated
the
city
s
soil
and
underground
water
tables
as
well
as
causing
devastating
subsidence
that
has
left
large
parts
of
its
old
mining
districts
unfit
for
farming
or
construction
the
city
was
also
ranked
as
one
of
the
country
s
worst
performers
when
it
came
to
meeting
water
quality
standards
in
the
of
this
year
shanxi
which
produces
nearly
a
billion
tonnes
of
coal
a
year
has
been
forced
to
relocate
more
than
people
from
unsafe
former
mining
districts
at
risk
of
collapse
the
province
is
one
of
china
s
major
pollution
control
zones
over
the
period
and
it
is
under
pressure
to
keep
coal
consumption
levels
unchanged
from
neighboring
hebei
which
has
been
on
the
frontline
of
china
s
war
on
pollution
since
established
similar
zones
in
several
districts
in
the
smog
prone
cities
of
langfang
and
baoding
last
year
hebei
was
ordered
by
the
central
government
to
cut
coal
consumption
by
million
tonnes
over
the
period
as
part
of
its
commitments
to
boost
air
quality
however
the
province
struggled
to
find
the
natural
gas
supplies
required
to
replace
coal
heating
systems
for
thousands
of
rural
households
last
winter
forcing
the
government
to
slow
the
conversion
process
according
to
a
report
submitted
to
parliament
earlier
this
year
all
households
in
the
region
as
well
as
the
neighboring
provinces
of
shanxi
and
shaanxi
will
have
converted
from
coal
to
natural
gas
heating
by
the
report
said
million
households
throughout
northern
china
had
already
made
the
switch
over
the
period
