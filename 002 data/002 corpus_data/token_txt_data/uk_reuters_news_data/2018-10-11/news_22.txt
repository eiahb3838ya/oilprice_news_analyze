exclusive-naftogaz courting partners to develop ukraine gas fields
london

ukraine
s
naftogaz
is
in
talks
in
london
with
a
number
of
big
oil
and
gas
firms
to
help
it
develop
the
country
s
existing
and
gas
fields
the
company
s
chief
executive
has
told
reuters
ukraine
is
looking
to
increase
domestic
production
so
it
can
lessen
its
energy
dependence
on
hostile
neighbour
russia
the
cost
of
which
is
straining
kiev
s
limited
finances
ukraine
used
to
produce
around
billion
cubic
meters
bcm
of
gas
a
year
when
it
was
part
of
the
soviet
union
but
now
draws
out
only
around
bcm
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
am
currently
in
london
is
that
i
am
negotiating
with
big
international
oil
and
gas
companies
potential
partnership
agreements
to
develop
gas
fields
in
ukraine
chief
executive
andriy
kobolev
said
in
an
interview
kobolev
believes
the
potential
to
recover
some
of
the
production
lost
over
the
last
years
is
sizable
if
it
can
revive
existing
gas
fields
and
tap
new
shale
and
offshore
areas
we
have
done
lots
of
studies
we
have
lots
of
geological
materials
we
have
lots
of
experience
producing
from
those
fields
and
we
see
huge
potential
he
said
by
the
end
of
the
year
we
will
sign
at
least
one
partnership
and
i
believe
if
we
have
one
partner
this
year
i
would
expect
we
could
sign
partnership
agreements
with
at
least
two
big
names
next
ukraine
imported
almost
percent
of
its
gas
during
last
year
s
icy
winter
but
the
cost
has
risen
in
recent
years
due
to
the
hryvnia
s
devaluation
in
international
currency
markets
the
international
monetary
fund
is
also
demanding
kiev
hike
what
households
are
charged
for
gas
to
match
what
it
costs
the
country
to
buy
it
at
the
moment
that
requires
a
roughly
percent
increase
it
s
a
tough
political
sell
ahead
of
presidential
elections
next
year
but
without
it
the
imf
is
unlikely
to
disperse
a
trillion
aid
tranche
my
hope
is
the
imf
deal
will
be
reached
this
month
kobolev
said
this
might
sound
strange
he
added
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
such
reforms
gas
price
rises
if
they
are
done
the
right
way
they
can
actually
be
positive
for
the
his
advice
was
to
make
sure
poorer
parts
of
the
population
receive
special
payments
to
help
cover
their
increased
bills
on
top
of
that
they
should
be
able
to
keep
any
money
they
save
by
cutting
their
consumption
it
is
simple
you
need
to
monetise
if
kiev
and
the
imf
can
not
agree
a
new
aid
deal
however
kobolev
said
naftogaz
would
almost
certainly
have
to
shelve
its
plans
for
a
billion
bond
sale
that
has
been
pencilled
in
for
sometime
over
the
next
month
if
the
deal
doesn
t
happen
our
probability
of
success
will
be
very
very
