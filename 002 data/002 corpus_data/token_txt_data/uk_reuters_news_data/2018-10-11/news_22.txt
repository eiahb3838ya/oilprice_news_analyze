too
losses
in
london
paris
and
milan
were
already
climbing

percent
in
early
trading
although
the
selloff
wasn
t
quite
as
dramatic
as
the

it
meant
msci

emerging

index
was
having
its
worst
day
since
early
after

swoon

given

equivalent
its
worst
day
since

equity
markets
are
locked
in
a
sharp
with
concern
around
how
far
yields
will
rise
warnings
from
the
imf
about
financial
stability
risks
and
continued
trade
tension
all
driving
uncertainty
summed
up
analysts
at

came
as
the

of
the
international
monetary
fund
christine
lagarde
said
stock

valuations
have
been
extremely
high

since

the

market
value

shanghai
s
drop
was
its
most
severe
since
february
and
left
it
at
its
lowest
level
since
late
shares
in
taiwan
were
even
harder
hit
losing
percent
seoul
s
kospi
index
dropped
percent
i
think
what
happened
was
that
we
were
a
maximum
elevation
of
risk
appetite
and
maximum
valuation
of
large
caps
and
tech
so
when
you
have
that
situation
you
are
always
vulnerable
said
ubp
macro
and

koon
chow
europe
s
traders
retreated
to
the
safety
of
german
and
other
government
bonds
italian
bonds
aren
t
on
that
list
and
they
saw
more
selling
before
a
key
set
of
auctions
amid
ongoing
concern
about
the
country
s
financial
health
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
the
accelerating
equity
plunge
is
a
healthy
correction
or
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
commerzbank
analysts
said
in
a
note
for
sure
it
creates
a
more
challenging
environment
for
today
s
italian
sinking
global
shares
have
raised
the
stakes
for
inflation
figures
due
later
on
thursday
high
inflation
would
only
stoke
speculation
of
more
aggressive
rate
hikes
from
the
federal
reserve
on
wall
street
the
s
s
sharpest
fall
since
february
wiped
out
around
billion
of
wealth
as
technology
shares
tumbled
on
fears
of
slowing
demand
the
s
p
ended
wednesday
with
down
percent
the
nasdaq
composite
percent
and
the
dow
percent
the
bloodletting
attracted
the
attention
of
president
donald
trump
who
pointed
an
accusing
finger
at
the
fed
for
raising
interest
rates
i
really
disagree
with
what
the
fed
is
doing
trump
told
reporters
before
a
political
rally
in
pennsylvania
i
think
the
fed
has
gone
crazy
hawkish
commentary
from
fed
policymakers
triggered
the
off
in
treasuries
last
week
and
sent
yields
to
their
highest
in
seven
years
the
surge
made
stocks
look
less
attractive
compared
with
bonds
while
also
threatening
to
curb
economic
activity
and
profits
the
rise
in
treasury
yields
has
been
the
primary
catalyst
for
the
in
equities
since
higher
yields
suggest
a
lower
present
value
of
future
dividend
streams
assuming
an
unchanged
economic
outlook
said
steven
friedman
senior
economist
at
bnp
paribas
asset
management
it
is
also
possible
that
equity
investors
are
growing
concerned
that
the
federal
reserve
s
projected
rate
path
will
choke
off
the
the
shift
in
yields
is
also
sucking
funds
out
of
emerging
markets
putting
particular
pressure
on
the
chinese
yuan
as
beijing
fights
a
protracted
trade
battle
with
the
united
states
china
s
central
bank
has
been
allowing
the
yuan
to
gradually
decline
breaking
the
barrier
and
leading
speculators
to
push
the
dollar
up
to
at
gmt
china
s
move
has
forced
other
currencies
to
weaken
to
stay
competitive
and
drawn
the
ire
of
the
united
states
which
sees
it
as
an
unfair
devaluation
the
yuan
has
already
weakened
significantly
to
offset
the
tariffs
announced
so
far
said
alan
ruskin
deutsche
s
global
head
of

further
weakness
could
exacerbate
concerns
of
a
flight
of

a
