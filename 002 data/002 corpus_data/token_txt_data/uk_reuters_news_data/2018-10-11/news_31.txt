cheap
reliable
and
hard
to
hijack
the
sun
could
be
an
ideal
energy
source
in
many
war
zones
and
disaster
areas
prompting
aid
agencies
to
consider
ditching
costly
fuel
for
solar
power
while
the
technology
has
not
advanced
far
enough
to
make
a
full
swap
viable
some
solar
projects
are
already
underway
in
the
field
and
aid
workers
expect
many
more
to
follow
it
s
very
easy
to
exploit
the
fuel
chain
and
it
happens
in
a
number
of
big
emergencies
it
s
too
easy
to
nick
there
s
a
lot
of
bad
practice
around
making
money
out
of
fuel
said
andy
bastable
head
of
oxfam
s
water
and
sanitation
projects
traditional
fuel
can
be
used
as
a
weapon
hijacked
by
militants
sold
on
the
black
market
or
must
be
flown
vast
distances
to
reach
relief
camps
increasing
costs
and
volatility
for
the
aid
sector
and
the
sun
shines
in
most
areas
where
they
work
in
percent
of
cases
we
are
acting
in
places
where
there
is
abundant
solar
supply
said
eriksson
an
engineer
with
medical
charity
doctors
without

msf
to
avoid
logistical
challenges
and
over
time
to
save
costs
solar
energy
would
certainly
be
a
very
good
solution
in
most
of
our
projects
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
renewable
energy
sources
such
as
solar
power
are
key
to
reducing
emissions
and
keeping
the
earth
s
temperature
rise
to
degrees
celsius
a
report
this
week
by
the
united
nations
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
said
renewable
energy
would
need
to
supply
percent
of
electricity
by
to
stay
within
a
limit
compared
with
about
percent
now
for
engineer
talal
kanaan
rolling
out
nearly
solar
panels
to
power
hospitals
in
syria
last
year
was
the
logical
way
to
keep
the
country
s
health
system
running
we
didn
t
want
to
put
solar
for
the
sake
of
it
because
it
s
cool
or
environmentally
friendly
said
kanaan
founder
of
syria
solar
part
of
the
union
of
medical
care
and
relief
organizations
uossm
a
coalition
of
medical
groups
the
role
of
solar
was
to
increase
the
resilience
of
the
health
system
he
said
in
a
phone
interview
with
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
syria
s
electrical
grid
has
taken
a
big
hit
after
seven
years
of
war
with
infrastructure
destroyed
leaving
hospitals
relying
on
diesel
generators
and
at
the
mercy
of
fuel
shortages
the
costs
and
the
availability
of
fuel
is
volatile
that
s
the
problem
the
source
of
it
is
coming
from
an
area
that
is
in
conflict
or
across
the
firing
line
said
kanaan
he
said
fuel
could
easily
be
used
as
a
weapon
of
war
referring
to
when
islamic
state
militants
hijacked
oil
fields
in
northern
syria
which
drove
up
diesel
prices
and
paralysed
hospitals
ambulances
and
rescue
services
in
contrast
syria
solar
says
if
there
was
an
outage
its
solar
system
can
fully
power
an
intensive
care
unit
operating
rooms
and
emergency
departments
for
up
to
hours
without
diesel
which
is
to
percent
of
the
hospital
s
energy
cost
the
group
said
it
also
saves
about
litres
of
diesel
per
month
and
cuts
about
tonnes
of
carbon
each
year
using
grant
money
kanaan
said
he
hopes
to
deploy
electric
ambulances
next
year
and
remotely
connect
people
in
syria
with
overseas
doctors
through
online
services
like
skype
which
would
be
powered
by
the
existing
solar
energy
system
msf
s
eriksson
said
there
was
a
dire
need
to
use
solar
in
emergencies
especially
in
rural
areas
that
are
not
connected
to
the
grid
eriksson
who
has
worked
in
remote
parts
of
the
democratic
republic
of
congo
on
renewable
energy
projects
said
delivering
fuel
was
often
the
hardest
and
most
expensive
part
in
some
projects
we
even
fly
in
fuel
and
that
s
really
tough
and
costly
but
it
s
been
the
only
alternative
and
that
s
why
we
do
it
he
said
in
a
phone
interview
many
aid
groups
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
they
already
run
some
solar
energy
projects
but
admit
that
a
complete
switch
to
cleaner
energy
could
take
years
humanitarian
agencies
still
largely
depend
on
diesel
generators
said
alain
oppliger
a
sustainable
development
adviser
at
the
international
committee
of
the
red
cross
icrc
renewable
energy
sources
such
as
solar
panels
take
time
to
be
installed
when
you
require
energy
immediately
in
an
emergency
then
generators
are
still
the
best
option
said
oppliger
in
emailed
comments
many
locals
in
the
community
already
know
how
to
use
traditional
generators
but
implementing
solar
energy
would
need
specialised
knowledge
aid
agencies
said
but
one
of
the
biggest
hurdles
is
storing
excess
renewable
energy
in
large
enough
batteries
several
aid
agencies
said
battery
technology
hasn
t
moved
much
at
all
it
s
the
final
frontier
said
oxfam
s
bastable
if
they
can
come
up
with
some
kind
of
innovation
around
how
to
store
the
energy
better
then
renewables
become
a
lot
more
batteries
have
long
held
the
promise
of
solving
the
intermittent
nature
of
renewables
such
as
wind
and
solar
pairing
big
batteries
with
renewable
energy
boosts
reliability
without
creating
carbon
emissions
and
more
homes
and
businesses
are
looking
to
batteries
for
backup
power
and
to
capture
excess
energy
to
use
when
the
sun
is
not
shining
msf
s
eriksson
was
confident
technology
would
trickle
down
prices
for
solar
technology
are
coming
down
quite
rapidly
but
it
s
still
a
few
years
away
which
is
why
it
might
be
more
difficult
in
the
emergency
context
said
eriksson
but
i
really
strongly
believe
that
we
will
see
a
stronger
movement
towards
renewable
energy
over
the
coming
