walked
together
in
tough
and
good
times
and
we
will
but
prince

is
at
risk
of
being
overshadowed
by
pakistan

in
need
of

in
the
garrison
town
of

before

personally
drove
the
crown
prince
to
the
capital
islamabad
saudi
arabia
has
always
been
a
friend
in
need
which
is
why
we
value
it
so
much
said
khan
while
seated
next
to
prince
mohammed
i
want
to
thank
you
for
the
way
you
helped
us
when
we
were
in
bad
saudi
arabia
has
in
recent
months
helped
keep
pakistan
s
economy
afloat
by
propping
up
its
rapidly
dwindling
foreign
exchange
reserves
with
a
billion
loan
giving
islamabad
breathing
room
as
it
negotiates
a
bailout
with
the
international
monetary
fund
islamabad
has
shown
appreciation
by
treating
prince
mohammed
s
trip
as
the
biggest
state
visit
since
chinese
president
xi
jinping
in
soon
after
beijing
announced
plans
to
invest
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
on
infrastructure
in
pakistan
as
part
of
china
s
global
belt
and
road
initiative
the
tour
is
seen
as
a
attempt
by
the
crown
prince
to
rebuild
his
reputation
after
the
murder
of
saudi
critic
and
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
analysts
say
many
in
the
west
blamed
prince
mohammed
for
the
killing
which
triggered
the
kingdom
s
biggest
political
crisis
for
a
generation
he
has
denied
being
involved
he
had
also
planned
to
visit
indonesia
and
malaysia
during
the
tour
but
those
trips
have
been
postponed
according
to
malaysian
and
indonesian
officials
in
pakistan
most
of
the
agreements
signed
focused
on
energy
projects
including
a
billion
refinery
and
petrochemicals
complex
in
the
coastal
city
of
gwadar
where
china
is
building
a
port
memorandums
of
understanding
were
also
signed
for
investments
in
minerals
and
agriculture
khan
said
the
two
nations
relationship
has
in
the
past
centred
on
saudi
arabia
backing
pakistan
s
economy
during
difficult
periods
and
in
return
pakistan
s
powerful
army
lending
support
to
saudi
arabia
and
its
royal
family
as
the
guardians
of
most
holy
sites
in
the
birthplace
of
islam
the
saudi
royal
family
carries
vast
religious
clout
in
pakistan
a
staunchly
conservative
and
mainly
muslim
nation
of
million
people
what
is
happening
in
this
relationship
is
a
renewal
of
pakistan
s
commitment
to
help
protect
the
royal
family
and
the
order
as
it
exists
in
saudi
arabia
said
mosharraf
zaidi
senior
fellow
at
tabadlab
a
pakistani
think
tank
focused
on
global
and
local
public
policy
on
the
flip
side
there
is
reassurance
that
saudi
arabia
will
not
only
continue
to
serve
as
a
strategic
friend
who
will
help
shore
up
pakistan
s
finances
when
needed
but
it
s
also
going
to
become
a
participant
in
the
wider
investment
in
prince
mohammed
was
also
set
to
meet
representatives
of
the
afghan
taliban
militant
group
to
discuss
peace
negotiations
to
end
the
civil
war
in
afghanistan
pakistani
government
and
militant
sources
said
but
that
was
unlikely
after
the
taliban
spokesman
zabihullah
mujahid
said
the
group
s
planned
meetings
with
khan
and
officials
in
islamabad
