guaido
who
argues
that
maduro
s
was
a
sham
invoked
constitutional
provisions
to
declare
himself
the
country
s
leader
last
month
most
western
countries
and
many
of
venezuela
s
neighbors
have
recognized
guaido
as
the
legitimate
head
of
state
but
maduro
retains
the
backing
of
russia
and
china
and
control
of
venezuelan
state
institutions
including
the
military
guaido
has
said
he
will
announce
details
of

he
plans
to
get
the
aid
into
the

curacao
on

opposition

sets
the
stage

a
showdown
with
maduro

has
said
the
aid
is
not
needed
maduro
calls
the
aid
a
show
and
denies
any
crisis
despite
many
venezuelans
scant
access
to
food
and
medicine
it
is
unclear
whether
the
military
will
allow
aid
to
cross
the
border
rubio
of
florida
is
considered
to
have
played
a
major
role
in
convincing
president
donald
trump
a
fellow
republican
to
ratchet
up
pressure
on
maduro
the
senator
has
long
been
a
harsh
critic
of
the
venezuelan
leader
who
he
regularly
refers
to
as
a
dictator
on
social
media
and
has
urged
support
for
venezuela
s
opposition
standing
near
a
pedestrian
bridge
on
the
border
between
the
two
countries
as
hundreds
of
protesters
chanted
and
waved
flags
rubio
said
the
united
states
and
the
world
would
not
abandon
venezuelans
one
thing
is
to
see
human
suffering
another
is
to
see
it
up
close
and
personal
and
to
meet
the
people
and
hear
their
stories
he
said
what
is
happening
in
venezuela
is
a
crisis
of
epic
proportions
a
criminal
regime
that
is
willing
to
starve
and
kill
its
own
people
before
it
gives
up
the
delegation
including
carlos
trujillo
the
ambassador
to
the
organization
of
american
states
