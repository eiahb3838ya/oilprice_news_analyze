previous

africa
s
biggest
democracy
and
top
oil

have
been
marred
by
vote
rigging
voter
intimidation
and
violence
kingsley
moghalu
one
of
the
candidates
aside
from
buhari
and
atiku
and
civil
society
groups
said
there
was
uncertainty
over
the
extent
to
which
ballot
papers
and
result
sheets
may
have
been
exposed
there
is
the
risk
of
manipulation
said
moghalu
a
former
deputy
governor
of
the
central
bank
whose
campaign
has
focussed
on
reviving
the
economy
even
if
there
was
a
need
to
postpone
the
election
it
could
have
been
done
in
a
much
tidier
way
that
would
not
have
exposed
the
process
to
these
kinds
of
risks
he
said
they
fear
the
paperwork
that
was
distributed
only
to
be
recalled
hours
before
polling
was
due
to
begin
could
be
used
to
falsify
information
to
enable
vote
rigging
in
some
areas
voters
at
one
church
in
the
capital
abuja
appeared
largely
unfazed
on
sunday
the
last
two
presidential
elections
in
and
were
also
delayed
over
logistics
and
security
issues
are
people
demoralised
absolutely
definitely
but
we
are
also
a
resilient
people
whatever
it
takes
they
ve
shifted
it
to
next
week
we
are
ready
to
go
back
to
vote
said
banker
doyin
coker
at
the
church
mahmood
yakubu
chairman
of
the
electoral
commission
said
the
postponement
was
due
to
logistical
factors
he
denied
political
pressure
had
played
any
part
clement
nwankwo
convener
of
the
situation
room
which
represents
more
than
civil
society
groups
said
there
had
been
a
few
reports
from
some
of
the
organisation
s
observers
of
instances
in
which
the
ballots
have
been
exposed
although
he
said
the
scale
of
the
problem
was
not
clear
there
is
concern
over
whether
materials
that
have
travelled
are
safe
from
partisan
abuse
it
would
be
an
issue
of
how
much
manipulation
this
could
mean
said
nwankwo
he
said
civil
society
groups
were
due
to
hold
a
meeting
with
yakubu
on
monday
to
address
this
and
other
issues
over
the
delay
in
abuja
on
sunday
church
pastor

said
he
and
others
would
remain
patient
until
the

they
keep
postponing
and
cancelling
we
would
keep
getting
ready
until
the
day
