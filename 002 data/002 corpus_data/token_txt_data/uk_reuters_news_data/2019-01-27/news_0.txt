tensions
in
germany
s
loveless
ruling
coalition
flared
on
sunday
after
transport
minister
andreas
scheuer
a
conservative
from
the
state
of
bavaria
called
for
a
reassessment
of
limits
on
vehicle
emissions
scheuer
told
the
bild
am
sonntag
newspaper
he
would
raise
the
issue
and
could
push
for
changes
at
the
next
meeting
of
european
union
transport
ministers
following
the
publication
last
week
of
a
letter
in
which
more
than
doctors
questioned
current
limits
on
the
emission
of
particulates
he
said
germany
should
end
the
masochistic
debates
in
which
we
in
germany
harm
ourselves
with
limits
and
he
rejected
imposing
speed
limits
on
german
motorways
to
curb
emissions
and
help
meet
climate
protection
goals
environment
minister
svenja
schulze
a
member
of
the
social
democrats
spd
junior
partners
in
the
coalition
shot
back
in
an
interview
in
the
sueddeutsche
zeitung
newspaper
that
current
limits
were
and
there
no
reason
to
revise
them
we
should
support
communities
with
clean
air
programs
instead
of
letting
ourselves
succumb
to
diversionary
tactics
she
said
that
includes
for
example
pushing
for
retrofits
of
diesel
cars
as
quickly
as
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
coalition
has
been
deeply
strained
over
whether
to
impose
driving
bans
or
require
car
companies
to
retrofit
vehicles
to
lower
emissions
following
volkswagen
s
admission
more
than
three
years
ago
that
it
deliberately
cheated
pollution
tests
critics
say
conservatives
have
sought
to
shield
the
car
companies
from
the
high
costs
associated
with
retrofits
the
latest
dispute
comes
after
merkel
fragile
coalition
nearly
collapsed
last
summer
over
disagreements
on
migration
and
then
ran
into
trouble
after
the
former
chief
of
domestic
intelligence
presented
himself
as
the
victim
of
a
by
forces
in
the
spd
scheuer
s
comments
also
drew
criticism
from
the
opposition
greens
party
in
the
same
bild
am
sonntag
interview
he
accused
german
environmental
groups
that
favor
driving
bans
of
trying
to
destroy
the
country
s
car
industry
the
longstanding
debate
over
emissions
and
driving
bans
sparked
headlines
last
week
after
the
doctors
letter
dieter
koehler
a
former
president
of
the
german
respiratory
society
who
the
letter
said
on
a
talk
show
on
broadcaster
ard
on
sunday
that
the
eu
emission
limits
were
completely
absurd
and
not
based
on
hard
science
wichmann
an
epidemiologist
who
helped
develop
the
world
health
organization
guidelines
that
underpin
eu
standards
countered
that
koehler
was
a
complete
outsider
and
that
the
german
respiratory
society
itself
rejected
