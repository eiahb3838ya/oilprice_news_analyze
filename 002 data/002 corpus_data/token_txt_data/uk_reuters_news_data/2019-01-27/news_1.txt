the
nigerian
government
said
it
would
not
accept
any
foreign
meddling
after
the
european
union
united
states
and
britain
raised
concerns
over
last
week
s
suspension
of
nigeria

most
senior
judge
before
a
presidential
election
president

buhari
who

seeking
a

suspended
chief
justice
walter
onnoghen
on
friday
over
allegedly
breaching
rules
drawing
criticism
at
home
and
abroad
the
main
opposition
party
called
it
an
act
of
dictatorship
and
halted
its
election
campaign
for
hours
in
protest
the
eu
election
observation
team
said
onnoghen
s
suspension
raised
concerns
about
the
opportunity
for
electoral
justice
nigeria
s
judiciary
has
helped
resolve
electoral
disputes
following
previous
votes
some
of
which
have
been
marred
by
violence
and
vote
rigging
the
chief
justice
of
nigeria
cjn
could
rule
on
any
future
dispute
fg
federal
government
determined
to
ensure
free
fair
elections
this
government
will
not
bend
the
rules
and
will
not
allow
meddling
in
our
affairs
read
a
statement
issued
late
on
saturday
by
buhari
s
spokesman
garba
shehu
coming
hours
after
statements
expressing
concern
were
issued
by
the
and
britain
the
statement
said
the
government
would
reject
any
interference
or
perception
management
that
promotes
apprehension
about
the
outcome
of
the
election
in
a
separate
statement
issued
by
shehu
late
on
sunday
the
presidency
said
the
statements
by
the
three
seem
more
driven
by
unfounded
assumptions
and
to
be
honest
a
certain
condescension
to
this
african
it
questioned
the
link
drawn
between
the
judge
s
suspension
and
the
upcoming
election
since
he
would
only
be
called
upon
at
a
late
stage
of
any
dispute
for
the
authors
to
link
the
cjn
to
the
elections
in
this
way
is
illogical
unless
they
assume
that
election
complaints
will
be
filed
and
will
go
all
the
way
to
the
supreme
court
the
statement
said
onnoghen
has
not
responded
to
the
charges
and
his
lawyers
say
the
tribunal
does
not
have
the
authority
to
try
him
buhari
who
took
office
in
after
winning
an
election
largely
on
his
vow
to
fight
corruption
and
improve
security
