iraq
must
wean
itself
off
economic
reliance
on
iran
and
become
more
energy
britain
s
foreign
office
minister
for
the
middle
east
said
on
sunday
alistair
burt
visited
iraq
after
a
flurry
of
diplomacy
in
baghdad
this
month
that
followed
president
donald
trump
s
surprise
announcement
he
was
pulling
american
troops
out
of
syria
allies
worry
the
withdrawal
even
if
it
proceeds
more
slowly
than
initially
planned
will
embolden
iran
whose
influence
has
grown
in
iraq
and
syria
in
recent
years
washington
hopes
to
counter
iranian
influence
through
renewed
sanctions
and
has
pressured
iraq
to
halt
imports
of
iranian
gas
to
expect
iran
to
have
no
influence
in
iraq
is
fanciful
burt
said
in
an
interview
with
reuters
at
the
british
embassy
in
baghdad
what
is
important
is
that
iraq
finds
the
opportunity
to
follow
its
own
future
in
terms
of
foreign
relations
and
that
its
economy
is
strong
and
isn
t
reliant
on
burt
said
iraq
must
convert
oil
resources
to
become
more
the
sooner
all
its
oil
wealth
can
come
on
stream
and
can
capture
all
the
energy
that
is
sometimes
not
used
as
effectively
as
possible
the
better
he
said
iraq
s
oil
export
capacity
is
nearly
million
barrels
per
day
although
it
is
pumping
below
capacity
in
line
with
an
opec
agreement
to
reduce
production
to
stabilise
prices
washington
hopes
it
can
reduce
its
gas
flaring
to
satisfy
domestic
energy
needs
and
rely
less
on
iranian
power
imports
burt
said
there
were
ideas
for
more
power
projects
in
iraq
without
elaborating
tensions
mount
he
doubted
that
a
military
escalation
between
the
united
states
and
iran
in
iraq
or
syria
was
imminent
but
warned
of
confrontation
which
might
occur
should
there
be
a
tension
has
ramped
up
between
washington
s
chief
regional
ally
israel
and
iran
and
its
allies
in
syria
and
iraq
in
recent
weeks
israel
struck
what
it
said
were
iranian
targets
near
damascus
on
monday
in
an
increasingly
open
assault
on
iran
s
presence
there
burt
said
britain
remained
concerned
about
the
threat
from
islamic
state
in
the
region
especially
after
the
decision
to
withdraw
troops
and
that
london
would
continue
to
support
baghdad
s
efforts
against
remaining
is
militants
who
have
stepped
up
attacks
in
iraq
