germany
s
ruling
coalition
will
move
quickly
to
begin
implementing
the
recommendations
of
a
commission
for
exiting
coal
power
by
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
told
german
broadcaster
ard
on
sunday
altmaier
a
conservative
said
he
was
in
close
touch
with
finance
minister
olaf
scholz
a
social
democrat
about
the
issue
and
some
money
had
already
been
earmarked
in
the
budget
to
get
started
with
various
measures
we
need
a
whole
series
of
laws
including
one
that
would
secure
new
jobs
and
set
out
plans
for
closing
power
plants
altmaier
said
promising
quick
action
after
a
review
of
a
compromise
proposal
finalised
early
on
saturday
the
plans
call
for
shutting
down
the
last
of
germany
s
power
plants
by
at
the
latest
and
providing
at
least
billion
euros
billion
pounds
in
aid
to
regions
affected
by
the
altmaier
said
details
would
still
need
to
be
worked
after
the
proposals
were
reviewed
in
coming
days
environment
minister
svenja
schulze
a
social
democrat
said
exiting
coal
would
send
a
positive
signal
internationally
and
studies
completed
by
her
ministry
showed
the
shift
would
by
no
means
lead
to
higher
electricity
prices
eric
schweitzer
president
of
germany
s
chambers
of
commerce
dihk
welcomed
the
proposals
which
must
now
be
implemented
by
the
german
government
and
regional
states
but
said
they
could
drive
electricity
costs
higher
christian
lindner
leader
of
the
free
democrats
said
the
exit
from
coal
production
was
already
in
the
offing
due
to
climate
change
targets
and
the
commission
s
plan
would
further
inflate
already
high
german
energy
prices
there
was
absolutely
no
need
to
think
about
an
exit
from
coal
with
a
fixed
it
was
coming
anyway
he
said
he
said
it
would
be
far
more
efficient
and
economical
to
use
carbon
offsets
to
regulate
emissions
from
the
energy
and
transportation
sectors
the
coal
commission
proposed
that
an
independent
panel
assess
the
announced
measures
in
and
to
see
whether
they
were
delivering
in
the
intended
results
with
regard
to
jobs
security
of
supply
and
prices
schulze
said
regions
that
now
produced
coal
would
remain
important
players
in
the
german
energy
market
through
investment
in
new
technologies
renewables
and
climate
protection
the
proposals
embody
germany
s
strategy
of
shifting
to
renewable
sources
of
energy
which
made
up
more
than
percent
of
the
energy
mix
last
year
beating
coal
for
the
first
time
and
follow
a
decision
to
halt
nuclear
power
