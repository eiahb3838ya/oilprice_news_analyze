crude
prices
rose
on
friday
but
declined
on
the
week
on
worries
that
oversupply
would
weigh
on
the
market
while
trade
disputes
and
slowing
global
economic
growth
would
dampen
demand
for
oil
crude
declined
for
the
seventh
consecutive
week
and
global
benchmark
brent
was
dropped
for
a
third
week
one
of
the
biggest
concerns
out
there
is
that
china
s
demand
numbers
are
coming
down
if
china
s
gdp
growth
is
slowing

said
friday
s
pull
back
from

highs
came
on
mounting
worries
that
crude

would
post
another
consecutive
gain
said
bob

americas
government
data
this
week
showed
a
large
build
up
in
crude
inventories
with
production
also
increasing
investors
remain
cautious
as
wednesday

surprise
gain

remained
fresh
in

anz
bank
said
on
friday
the
number
of
oil
drilling
rigs
an
indicator
of
future
production
was
unchanged
this
week
at
rigs
much
higher
than
the
rigs
operating
a
year
ago
according
to
energy
company
baker
hughes
another
major
drag
on
prices
was
the
darkening
economic
outlook
on
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
china
and
weakening
emerging
market
currencies
that
are
weighing
on
growth
and
fuel
consumption
traders
and
analysts
said
investment
bank
jefferies
said
there
was
a
lack
of
demand
for
crude
oil
and
refined
products
from
emerging
markets
while
singapore
s
dbs
bank
said
that
chinese
data
showed
a
steady
decline
in
activity
and
that
the
economy
is
facing
added
headwinds
due
to
rising
trade
tensions
japan
s
mufg
bank
meanwhile
said
that
the
weakening
turkish
lira
will
constrain
further
growth
in
gasoline
and
diesel
demand
this
year
although
emerging
market
contagion
and
china
slowdown
fears
seem
somewhat
overstated
neither
fundamental
nor
sentiment
should
provide
support
for
higher
commodity
prices
julius
baer
head
of
macro
and
commodity
research
norbert
r√ºcker
said
furthermore
just
as
demand
seems
to
be
slowing
supply
looks
to
be
rising
increasing
the
drag
on
markets
despite
the
bearish
factors
analysts
said
prices
were
prevented
from
falling
further
because
of
sanctions
against
iran
which
target
the
financial
sector
from
august
and
will
include
petroleum
exports
from
november
iranian
crude
exports
were
still
near
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
july
and
will
likely
begin
to
fall
dramatically
in
august
with
financial
sanctions
taking
effect
with
oil
export
sanctions
now
three
months
out
we
expect
exports
to
fall
by
more
than
bpd

the
