from
developing
its
controversial
carmichael
coalmine
on
friday
clearing
one
of
the
final
legal
hurdles
to
its
development
the
company
is
still
securing
financing
for
the
a
billion
billion
first
stage
of
the
huge
mine
but
the
company
said
the
verdict
allows
it
to
secure
land
tenure
for
the
site
the
carmichael
mine
has
faced
years
of
delays
amid
opposition
from
environmental
groups
who
argue
it
will
contribute
to
global
warming
and
damage
the
great
barrier
reef
leading
some
banks
to
rule
out
any
role
in
funding
it
was
also
challenged
in
australia
s
federal
court
by
the
some
members
of
the
wangan
and
jagalingou
indigenous
groups
who
argued
the
company
did
not
properly
negotiate
indigenous
permission
for
the
mine
because
their
views
weren
t
sought
none
of
their
grounds
of
challenge
had
any
merit
justice
john
reeves
said
in
a
written
judgment
he
handed
down
in
brisbane
the
project
is
located
in
the
remote
galilee
basin
a
square
mile
expanse
in
the
central
outback
that
some
believe
has
the
potential
to
become
australia
s
largest
region
adani
said
in
a
statement
it
will
now
work
with
the
wangan
and
jagalingou
other
indigenous
landowners
and
government
authorties
take
the
next
steps
in
order
to
finalise
land
tenure
a
spokesman
for
the
wangan
and
jagalingou
flagged
an
appeal
unless
there
s
some
serious
from
our
legal
team
upon
reading
it
in
detail
the
thing
s
going
to
go
to
an
appeal
for
sure
anthony
esposito
an
adviser
to
the
wangan
and
jagalingou
told
reuters
by
phone
environmental
challenges
and
funding
also
still
remain
as
stumbling
blocks
they
were
compounded
when
australian
hauler
operator
aurizon
holdings
ltd
in
february
scrapped
plans
for
a
rail
line
that
could
have
served
the
mine
adani
had
hoped
to
start
shipping
coal
from
carmichael
by
march
in
the
first
stage
of
the
project
which
it
bought
amid
a
coal
boom
in
australian
dollars
