the

states
was
withdrawing
from
an
iran
nuclear
deal
sealed
in
between

and
six
world
powers
the
united
states
has
said
it

end
the
sanctions
if
iran
allowed
the
negotiation
of
a
tougher
deal
hook
who
was
a
close
adviser
to
former
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
worked
with
national
security
advisor
john
bolton
on
iran
sanctions

of
mitt

and
tim
pawlenty
trump
has
said
he
would
be
willing
to
meet
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
although
tehran
said
the
way
back
to
talks
was
for
the
united
states
to
return
to
the
nuclear
deal
asked
whether
he
supported
such
a
meeting
and
whether
his
brief
would
be
to
set
up
those
talks
hook
said
if
iran
showed
that
it
was
willing
to
change
its
behavior
then
trump
was
prepared
to
engage
in
dialogue
in
order
to
find
washington
aims
to
force
tehran
to
end
its
nuclear
program
and
its
support
of
militant
groups
in
the
middle
east
where
iran
is
involved
in
proxy
wars
from
yemen
to
syria
iran
and
other
signatories
including
britain
france
germany
russia
and
china
have
been
working
to
find
a
way
to
salvage
the
nuclear
agreement
even
as
the
united
states
has
started
reimposing
some
sanctions
on
iran
dennis
ross
a
former
official
in
democratic
and
republican
administrations
said
hook
s
new
post
might
be
a
bureaucratic
maneuver
to
try
to
inject
more
clarity
into
washington
s
policy
toward
tehran
it
creates
an
address
within
the
administration
for
making
the
approach
a
more
coherent
one
with
someone
being
given
broader
responsibility
across
departments
to
try
to
shape
the
policy
said
ross
now
a
fellow
at
the
washington
institute
for
near
east
policy
think
tank
at
least
that
would
be
the
real
question
is
is
the
policy
going
to
continue
to
be
just
basically
strong
tough
rhetoric
and
sanctions
or
is
it
going
to
be
something
more
to
curtail
what
washington
sees
as
iran
s
destabilizing
actions
in
syria
yemen
and
iraq
