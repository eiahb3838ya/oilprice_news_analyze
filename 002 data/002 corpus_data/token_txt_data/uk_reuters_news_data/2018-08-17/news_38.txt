update 1-texas, refineries urged to plan storm shutdowns to cut pollution
washington
reuters
texas
environment
regulators
should
coordinate
shutdowns
of
oil
refineries
and
other
petrochemical
plants
during
major
storms
to
avoid
big
releases
of
air
pollution
like
during
last
year
s
hurricane
harvey
a
report
said
on
thursday
a
year
ago
harvey
dumped
more
than
inches
meters
of
rain
on
southeastern
texas
halting
refineries
that
produce
a
quarter
of
fuel
and
damaging
infrastructure
texas
industry
including
refineries
and
petrochemical
plants
released
an
extra
million
pounds
million
kg
of
air
pollutants
including
benzene
during
harvey
said
the
report
by
the
environmental
integrity
project
the
report
called
preparing
for
the
next
storm
can
be
seen
at
most
of
that
pollution
was
released
in
the
houston
area
where
refineries
did
not
shut
until
the
rains
arrived
three
days
after
texas
governor
greg
abbott
issued
a
warning
for
coastal
counties
much
of
that
pollution
resulted
from
equipment
malfunctions
and
electrical
outages
emissions
that
could
have
been
avoided
if
the
state
coordinated
early
shutdowns
the
report
said
in
corpus
christi
refineries
that
shut
before
rains
came
released
less
pollution
on
average
the
report
said
houston
suffered
three
high
ozone
days
which
can
be
dangerous
for
people
with
lung
and
heart
conditions
following
harvey
including
the
worst
day
for
smog
in
texas
in
the
state
should
take
a
more
approach
for
future
storms
because
with
climate
change
we
are
going
to
have
more
storms
like
this
said
tom
pelton
a
spokesman
at
the
eip
headed
by
former
environmental
protection
agency
director
of
civil
enforcement
eric
schaeffer
the
report
recommended
that
the
texas
commission
on
environmental
quality
plan
coordinate
and
stagger
the
complicated
shutdowns
of
major
industrial
facilities
during
hurricanes
and
other
disasters
as
well
as
the
subsequent
restarting
of
plants
to
reduce
pollution
it
also
recommended
that
the
state
not
suspend
pollution
reporting
requirements
during
future
natural
disasters
as
it
did
for
months
after
harvey
tceq
spokesman
brian
mcgovern
said
every
storm
is
unique
and
every
plant
is
unique
so
developing
a
approach
would
be
a
virtually
impossible
refining
companies
should
invest
in
robust
backup
power
generation
systems
and
the
best
available
pollution
controls
to
reduce
emissions
during
storms
eip
said
chet
thompson
the
head
of
the
industry
group
the
american
fuel
and
petrochemical
manufacturers
said
refineries
and
petrochemical
plants
have
already
put
generators
on
higher
land
hardened
infrastructure
and
will
apply
lessons
learned
from
harvey
he
did
not
directly
address
eip
s
recommendations
about
investing
in
extra
backup
power
systems
or
better
pollution
controls
