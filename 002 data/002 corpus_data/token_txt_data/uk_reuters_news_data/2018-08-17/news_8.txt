rolling summer blackouts weigh on libya's struggling traders
benghazi
reuters
lengthy
power
outages
have
left
tradesmen
and
small
businesses
in
libya
struggling
to
survive
in
an
economy
already
crippled
by
a
liquidity
crisis
and
high
inflation
for
several
years
power
cuts
lasting
most
of
the
day
have
become
common
across
the
north
african
country
during
the
hot
summer
months
when
air
conditioning
drives
up
electricity
demand
bill
payment
for
heavily
subsidized
electricity
is
rarely
enforced
so
there
is
little
incentive
to
limit
consumption
plans
to
boost
capacity
at
power
stations
have
stalled
due
to
security
problems
and
political
turmoil
meaning
a
shortfall
of
at
least
mw
at
times
of
high
demand
that
leaves
small
businesses
facing
constant
disruption
in
libya

city
benghazi
caf√©
owner
ibrahim
elumami
says
power
cuts
nearly
halve
the
rate
at
which
he
sells
coffee
and
have
also
forced
him
to
stop
offering
fresh
juice
frankly
the
power
cuts
in
benghazi
have
become
unbearable
there
are
long
cuts
and
short
cuts
and
in
both
cases
we
take
losses
he
said
i
have
a
generator
but
it
s
not
good
it
works
for
four
hours
then
can
t
keep
going
because
of
the
coffee
at
metal
workshops
in
the
city
owners
say
they
reopen
at
night
when
power
returns
or
work
by
hand
power
surges
that
occur
when
the
electricity
is
switched
back
on
can
break
their
machines
and
industrial
generators
cost
around
libyan
dinars
at
black
market
rates
generator
repair
work
is
one
of
libya
s
few
flourishing
trades
the
economy
has
been
crippled
by
the
conflict
that
developed
after
a
uprising
as
well
as
by
the
competition
between
rival
factions
and
governments
power
supply
is
overseen
by
separate
administrations
in
the
east
and
west
the
east
was
receiving
about
mw
from
neighbouring
egypt
last
week
a
power
official
said
but
still
faced
a
supply
shortfall
of
up
to
mw
in
the
capital
tripoli
in
the
more
populous
west
power
outages
have
been
lasting
hours
a
day
but
sometimes
stretch
to
more
than
hours
gecol
the
state
power
supplier
based
in
tripoli
has
blamed
the
crisis
on
problems
including
lack
of
funding
for
regular
maintenance
and
on
theft
and
vandalism
it
frequently
reports
the
theft
of
copper
from
power
facilities
and
recently
deployed
technicians
to
remove
illegal
connections
cutting
more
than
in
the
first
six
days
of
the
campaign
in
tripoli
militias
have
also
manipulated
the
power
network
to
ensure
supplies
for
their
neighbourhoods
officials
say
on
both
sides
of
the
country
living
standards
have
declined
steeply
as
the
dinar
has
lost
value
on
the
parallel
market
inflation
has
climbed
to
around
percent
and
banks
have
run
out
of
cash
a
divided
central
bank
and
an
internationally
recognised
government
in
tripoli
have
failed
to
deliver
on
promised
reforms
deepening
resentment
among
citizens
forced
to
queue
at
banks
for
hours
or
even
days
to
make
withdrawals
residents
also
vent
their
anger
against
a
largely
powerless
parallel
government
in
the
east
where
prices
for
sheep
ahead
of
next
week
s
muslim
holiday
of
eid
have
risen
to
record
levels
hopes
that
the
power
supply
crisis
will
be
resolved
have
dimmed
i
use
an
electric
oven
and
if
there
s
no
power
it
means
i
can
not
serve
my
customers
said
tripoli
restaurant
owner
mohamed
zighaale
who
fears
he
may
have
to
close
i

the
salaries
of

but
at
the
end
i

nothing
