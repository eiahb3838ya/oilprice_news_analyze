foundation
for
the
millions
of
sun
seekers
who
head
to
thailand
s
resort
island
of
phuket
each
year
in
search
of
stunning
beaches
and
clear
waters
cutting
down
on
waste
may
not
be
a
top
priority
but
the
island
s
hotel
association
is
hoping
to
change
that
with
a
series
of
initiatives
aimed
at
reducing
the
use
of
plastic
tackling
the
garbage
that
washes
up
on
its
shores
and
educating
staff
local
communities
and
tourists
alike
hotels
unchecked
are
huge
consumers
and
users
of
plastics
said
anthony
lark
president
of
the
phuket
hotels
association
and
managing
director
of
the
trisara
resort
every
resort
in
southeast
asia
has
a
plastic
problem
until
we
all
make
a
change
it
s
going
to
get
worse
and
worse
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
established
in
and
with
about
members
including
all
phuket
s
hotels
the
association
has
put
tackling
environmental
issues
high
on
its
list
last
year
the
group
surveyed
members
plastics
use
and
then
began
looking
at
ways
to
shrink
their
plastics
footprint
as
part
of
this
three
months
ago
the
association
s
hotels
committed
to
phase
out
or
put
plans
in
place
to
stop
using
plastic
water
bottles
and
plastic
drinking
straws
by
about
five
years
ago
lark
s
own
resort
with
about
villas
used
to
dump
into
landfill
about
plastic
water
bottles
annually
it
has
now
switched
to
reusable
glass
bottles
the
hotel
association
also
teamed
up
with
the
documentary
makers
of
a
plastic
ocean
and
now
show
an
edited
version
with
thai
subtitles
for
staff
training
meanwhile
hotel
employees
and
local
school
children
take
part
in
regular
beach
the
association
is
involved
in
good
and
inclusive
action
rather
than
just
hotel
general
managers
getting
together
for
a
drink
lark
said
phuket
like
bali
in
indonesia
and
boracay
in
the
philippines
has
become
a
top
holiday
destination
in
southeast
asia
and
faces
similar
challenges
of
a
similar
size
to
singapore
and
at
the
geographical
heart
of
southeast
asia
phuket
is
easily
accessible
to
tourists
from
china
india
malaysia
and
australia
with
its
white
sandy
beaches
and
infamous
nightlife
phuket
attracts
about
million
visitors
each
year
media
reports
say
helping
make
the
thai
tourism
industry
one
of
the
few
bright
spots
in
an
otherwise
lacklustre
economy
popular
with
holiday
makers
and
retirees
phuket
like
many
other
southeast
asian
resorts
must
contend
with
traffic
congestion
poor
water
management
and
patchy
waste
collection
services
despite
these
persistent
problems
hotels
in
the
region
need
to
follow
phuket
s
lead
and
step
up
action
to
cut
their
dependence
on
plastics
said
susan
ruffo
a
managing
director
at
the
group
ocean
conservancy
worldwide
between
million
and
million
tonnes
of
plastic
are
dumped
in
the
ocean
every
year
killing
marine
life
and
entering
the
human
food
chain
un
environment
says
five
asian
countries
china
indonesia
the
philippines
vietnam
and
thailand
account
for
up
to
percent
of
plastic
waste
leaking
into
the
seas
an
ocean
conservancy
study
found
as
both
creators
and
victims
of
waste
the
hotel
industry
has
a
lot
to
gain
by
making
efforts
to
control
their
own
waste
and
helping
their
guests
do
the
same
ruffo
said
we
are
seeing
more
and
more
resorts
and
chains
start
to
take
action
but
there
is
a
lot
more
to
be
done
particularly
in
the
area
of
ensuring
that
hotel
waste
is
properly
collected
and
recycled
she
added
data
on
how
much
plastic
is
used
by
hotels
and
the
hospitality
industry
is
hard
to
find
but
packaging
accounts
for
up
to
percent
of
an
establishment
s
waste
stream
according
to
a
study
by
the
travel
foundation
a
charity
water
bottles
shampoo
bottles
toothbrushes
and
even
food
delivered
by
room
service
all
tend
to
use
plastics
in
the
past
the
hospitality
industry
has
looked
at
how
to
use
less
water
and
energy
said
von
hernandez
global
coordinator
at
the
break
free
from
plastic
movement
in
manila
now
hotels
are
turning
their
attention
to
plastics
amid
growing
public
awareness
about
damage
to
oceans
a
lot
of
hotels
are
doing
good
work
around
plastics
adopting
measures
to
eliminate
or
shrink
their
footprint
said
hernandez
but
hotels
in
southeast
asia
often
have
to
contend
with
poor
waste
management
and
crumbling
infrastructure
i
ve
seen
resorts
in
bali
that
pay
staff
to
rake
the
beach
every
morning
to
get
rid
of
plastic
but
then
they
either
dig
a
hole
and
bury
it
or
burn
it
on
the
beach
said
ruffo
those
are
not
effective
solutions
and
can
lead
to
other
hotels
should
look
at
providing
reusable
water
containers
and
refill
stations
giving
guests
metal
or
bamboo
drinking
straws
and
bamboo
toothbrushes
and
replacing
soap
and
shampoo
containers
with
refillable
dispensers
experts
said
over
time
this
could
actually
lower
their
operational
costs
it
could
give
them
savings
said
hernandez
it
could
help
change
mindsets
of
people
so
that
when
they
go
back
to
their
usual
lives
they
have
a
little
bit
of
back
in
phuket
the
hotel
association
is
exploring
ways
to
cut
plastic
waste
further
and
will
host
its
first
regional
forum
on
environmental
awareness
next
month
the
hope
is
that
what
the
group
has
learned
over
the
last
two
years
can
be
implemented
at
other
southeast
asian
resorts
and
across
the
wider
community
if
the
staff
in
our
hotels
go
home
and
educate
mum
and
dad
about
recycling
or
reusing
it
going
to
make
a
big
difference
