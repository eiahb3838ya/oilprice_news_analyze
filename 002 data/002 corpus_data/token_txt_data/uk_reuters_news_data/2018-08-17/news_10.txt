warren
bachman
a
iowa
soybean
farmer
is
one
of
many
who
turned
clarke
county
into
donald
trump
country
as
the
republican
president
took
percent
of
the
votes
in
in
a
county
that
went
for
democrat
barack
obama
four
years
earlier
but
bachman
s
loyalty
to
trump
is
wavering
under
the
weight
of
a
trade
war
that
has
disproportionately
hurt
farmers
due
to
big
tariffs
on
agricultural
exports
other
farmers
meanwhile
are
upset
that
the
white
house
has
not
yet
followed
through
on
a
promise
to
reform
rules
that
would
boost
demand
for
ethanol
one
of
the
state
s
biggest
businesses
i
still
support
him
but
not
as
much
bachman
said
between
bites
of
pork
chops
and
baked
beans
at
the
iowa
state
fair
in
des
moines
last
week
i
am
afraid
we
are
close
to
seeing
a
repeat
of
the
where
farmers
across
iowa
lost
their
land
because
they
ran
out
of
money
and
couldn
t
get
november
s
congressional
elections
represent
the
first
nationwide
response
to
trump
s
aggressive
trade
policies
particularly
in
the
farm
belt
which
runs
roughly
from
indiana
to
kansas
and
the
dakotas
which
favored
trump
heavily
two
years
ago
the
administration
s
move
to
impose
numerous
tariffs
on
imports
has
sparked
retaliation
particularly
from
top
agricultural
buyer
china
which
put
levies
on
products
like
hogs
corn
and
soybeans
hammering
those
markets
soybeans
are
among
the
with
prices
down
percent
since
may
the
united
states
exported
billion
in
agriculture
products
in
including
billion
in
soybeans
according
to
the
department
of
agriculture
farmers
say
they
are
growing
impatient
as
harvest
season
approaches
trump
is
more
popular
in
the
farm
belt
than
in
the
nation
overall
but
his
support
there
has
dipped
from
percent
approval
in
to
percent
in
early
august
according
to
polling
trump
won
iowa
by
percentage
points
in
after
obama
carried
the
state
twice
for
a
graphic
on
how
trump
farm
belt
approval
rating
has
fallen
with
soybean
and
hog
prices
see
the
anxiety
is
starting
to
escalate
said
iowa
governor
kim
reynolds
a
republican
locked
in
a
tight
race
with
democrat
fred
hubbell
they
are
willing
to
give
him
some
more
time
but
the
window
is
closing
and
they
have
to
see
some
movement
somewhere
to
alleviate
the
bachman
said
he
is
a
registered
republican
but
has
not
decided
whether
to
vote
for
reynolds
in
november
saying
he
will
pull
the
lever
for
whoever
will
best
protect
the
state
s
agricultural
industry
he
said
the
tariffs
on
imported
metals
have
increased
the
costs
for
farming
equipment
but
that
he
had
saved
money
for
a
down
cycle
but
his
wife
linda
bachman
who
supported
hillary
clinton
in
said
her
husband
is
too
proud
to
acknowledge
the
burden
on
their
family
including
their
son
who
is
just
starting
out
as
a
farmer
he
s
stressed
out
i
see
it
every
day
and
we
are
worried
about
our
son
she
said
democrats
are
hoping
to
pick
up
two
congressional
seats
in
iowa
as
part
of
their
quest
to
win
the
house
of
representatives
they
need
to
win
a
net
seats
to
regain
control
of
the
chamber
the
president
is
using
iowa
farmers
and
its
families
as
poker
chips
in
a
trade
war
said
abby
finkenauer
a
democrat
running
against
republican
incumbent
rod
blum
in
a
race
for
a
house
seat
in
eastern
iowa
that
forecasters
rate
a
blum
has
been
a
staunch
trump
supporter
in
a
region
that
generally
leans
to
democrats
in
presidential
elections
but
which
flipped
to
trump
in
last
month
in
iowa
blum
publicly
thanked
trump
for
his
trade
stance
you
ve
taken
some
heat
for
it
in
the
but
in
the
long
run
the
farmers
the
manufacturers
the
employers
are
all
going
to
be
better
off
said
blum
who
did
not
respond
to
interview
requests
the
administration
last
month
announced
billion
in
aid
for
farmers
hurt
by
tariffs
finkenauer
however
said
the
state
needs
someone
to
stand
up
to
the
president
not
pat
him
on
the
back
china
s
tariffs
are
a
direct
hit
to
iowa
the
nation
s
top
exporter
of
corn
and
pork
and
no
exporter
of
soybeans
behind
illinois
iowa
exported
nearly
billion
in
agricultural
goods
in
trailing
only
california
according
to
usda
data
china
is
the
world
s
biggest
importer
of
soybeans
and
among
the
largest
pork
buyers
but
iowa
farmers
are
also
getting
hit
by
levies
imposed
by
mexico
the
leading
importer
of
pork
dean
hamblin
owns
a
farm
in
buchanan
county
which
also
flipped
to
trump
from
obama
in
an
august
town
hall
event
he
urged
republican
senator
joni
ernst
to
push
the
president
to
act
quickly
we
can
t
wait
for
a
year
to
settle
this
tariff
business
if
we
lose
those
markets
they
will
be
gone
forever
hamblin
told
ernst
who
agreed
prices
for
lean
hog
futures
have
fallen
percent
since
may
ernst
noted
farmers
are
throwing
away
pigs
heads
for
the
first
time
because
the
tariffs
wiped
out
the
market
for
them
hog
parts
such
as
feet
tongue
and
heads
are
shunned
by
most
americans
but
are
considered
a
delicacy
in
china
and
iowa
farmers
had
profited
handsomely
by
exporting
those
products
trump
s
energy
policies
also
factor
in
to
the
election
outlook
iowa
is
the
top
producer
of
ethanol
it
produced
million
barrels
in
a
quarter
of
the
nation
s
total
according
to
the
energy
department
and
as
such
federal
policy
regarding
this
biofuel
is
a
sensitive
topic
in
the
state
refiners
are
required
by
law
to
blend
billion
gallons
of
biofuels
yearly
into
the
fuel
supply
but
the
government
has
not
increased
that
level
for
several
years
causing
domestic
ethanol
demand
to
flatline
to
increase
demand
farmers
have
asked
washington
to
rescind
a
ban
on
selling
a
gasoline
with
higher
levels
of
ethanol
in
the
summer
that
has
not
happened
yet
instead
over
the
last
year
the
industry
has
become
embroiled
in
a
related
dispute
with
washington
the
white
house
has
become
more
aggressive
than
the
obama
administration
in
granting
numerous
requests
from
refiners
seeking
relief
from
having
to
blend
or
pay
for
the
cost
of
adding
biofuels
to
the
nation
s
fuel
supply
that
undercuts
demand
for
ethanol
farmers
say
last
month
trump
attempted
to
mollify
the
corn
industry
telling
a
roomful
of
iowa
farmers
that
he
was
close
to
lifting
the
ban
drawing
cheers
in
the
state
and
surprise
in
washington
from
those
unaware
of
the
plans
trump
in
recent
weeks
has
told
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
and
others
to
strike
a
deal
with
the
oil
industry
that
will
lift
the
ban
according
to
three
sources
briefed
on
the
meetings
oil
companies
have
opposed
these
efforts
the
goal
was
to
get
something
done
in
august
to
help
embattled
incumbents
like
blum
but
summer
is
nearly
over
and
farmers
have
not
seen
the
relief
they
expected
we
are
sick
of
the
runaround
on
the
said
kevin
ross
an
iowa
farmer
from
pottawattamie
county
which
trump
won
with
percent
of
the
vote
this
is
something
that
has
gone
on
way
too
