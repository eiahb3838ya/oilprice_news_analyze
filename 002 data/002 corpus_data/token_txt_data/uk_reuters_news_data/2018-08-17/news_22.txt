berlin
reuters
chancellor
angela
merkel
has
warned
against
expectations
that
her
meeting
with
russian
president
vladimir
putin
on
saturday
will
produce
any
breakthrough
on
the
conflicts
in
ukraine
and
syria
speaking
on
the
eve
of
talks
with
the
russian
leader
merkel
pitched
the
meeting
as
the
product
of
necessity
rather
than
choice
russia
and
germany
must
engage
in
dialogue
on
the
long
list
of
problems
they
have
an
interest
in
solving
it
s
a
working
meeting
from
which
no
specific
results
are
expected
but
the
number
of
problems
that
occupy
us
from
ukraine
and
syria
to
the
issue
of
economic
cooperation
is
so
big
that
it
is
justified
to
be
in
a
permanent
dialogue
merkel
said
merkel
spoke
to
french
president
emmanuel
macron
on
friday
ahead
of
her
meeting
with
putin
and
discussed
the
situation
in
ukraine
and
syria
macron
s
office
said
friday
in
a
statement
without
elaborating
merkel
and
putin
last
met
in
sochi
in
may
when
they
struggled
to
overcome
differences
during
the
german
chancellor
s
first
visit
to
russia
since
it
annexed
ukraine
s
crimea
peninsula
in
the
annexation
and
ensuing
conflict
between
separatists
in
eastern
ukraine
and
the
ukrainian
army
set
off
the
worst
confrontation
between
russia
and
the
west
since
world
war
two
russia
and
germany
agree
that
an
internationally
brokered
peace
deal
known
as
the
minsk
agreement
must
be
fully
implemented
to
end
the
conflict
but
can
not
agree
on
the
mandate
of
the
peacekeeping
mission
germany
and
france
want
troops
deployed
in
all
areas
controlled
by
rebels
including
on
the
border
russia
opposes
this
idea
relations
between
the
two
countries
have
also
been
strained
by
the
nord
stream
pipeline
that
will
carry
gas
from
russia
to
germany
under
the
baltic
sea
the
united
states
says
it
will
increase
germany
s
dependence
on
russia
for
energy
ukraine
fears
the
pipeline
will
allow
russia
to
cut
it
off
from
the
gas
transit
business
germany
s
eastern
european
neighbours
nervous
of
russian
encroachment
have
also
raised
concerns
about

spokesman
for
merkel
said
this
week
that
the
european
union
was
still
in
talks
with
russia
to
ensure
that
ukraine
continues
to
play
a
role
in
the
lucrative
energy
transit
business
even
after
nord
stream
is
completed
on
syria
germany
wants
putin
to
finalise
a
lasting
ceasefire
there
