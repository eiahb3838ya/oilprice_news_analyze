on

after
china

the

agreed
to
hold
their

news
that
a
chinese
delegation
led
by
vice
minister
of
commerce
wang
shouwen
will
meet
representatives
helped
to
improve
the
mood
the
meeting
is
set
to
take
place
as
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
are
due
to
slap
tariffs
on
billions
of
dollars
of
eachother
s
goods
on
in
addition
to
levies
that
took
effect
on

but
there
are
doubts
over
whether
talks
can
resolve
the
trade
dispute
given
what
is
at
stake
white

economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
warned
beijing
not
to
underestimate
president
donald
trump
s
resolve
in
pushing
for
changes
in
china
s
economic
policies
indeed
chinese
share
markets
were
hardly
impressed
by
the
news
the
shanghai
composite
index
fell
percent
by
early
afternoon
for
a
weekly
fall
of
percent
risking
a
close
below
a
year
low
set
on
msci
china
mostly
made
up
of
chinese
shares
listed
in
hong
kong
and
the
united

has
fallen
percent
so
far
this
week
that
weighed
on
msci
emerging
markets
index
which
closed
at
a
low
on
thursday
that
weakness
also
stemmed
from
falls
in
emerging
market
currencies
after
the
turkish
lira
plunged
this
month
on
concerns
about
diplomatic
rifts
between
ankara
and
washington
because
of
the
currency
crisis
in
turkey
investors
are
shifting
funds
from
emerging
markets
to
developed
markets
said
shuji
shirota
head
of
macro
economic
strategy
at
hsbc
securities
in
tokyo
but
if
you
look
at
prospects
the
could
be
affected
if
the
trade
disputes
linger
given
a
president
tends
to
do
badly
in
his
first
election
he
might
do
more
on
trade
issues
after
the
election
he
added
in
the
currency
market
the
lira
slipped
percent
to
per
dollar
but
it
retained
much
of
its
rebound
this
week
and
up
almost
percent
from
its
record
low
of
hit
early
on
monday
despite
threats
of
more
sanctions
from
washington
it
has
gained
some
support
from
the
announcement
late
on
wednesday
of
a
qatari
pledge
to
invest
billion

turkey
the
offshore
chinese
yuan
weakened
slightly
after
a
percent
climb
on

biggest
daily
gain
since
january

the

talks
news
the
yuan
last
stood
at

down
percent
on
the
day
but
still
off
wednesday
s
low
of
we
believe
that
the
wave
of
rmb
depreciation
is
probably
over
and
that
renewed
fiscal
stimulus
in
china
will
bring
a
halt
to
decelerating
growth
as
well
as
higher
