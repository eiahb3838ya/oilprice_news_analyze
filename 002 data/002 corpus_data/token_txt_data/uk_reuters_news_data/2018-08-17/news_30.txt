analysis-russian oil industry would weather u.s. 'bill from hell'
moscow
reuters
stiff
new
sanctions
against
russia
would
only
have
a
limited
impact
on
its
oil
industry
because
it
has
drastically
reduced
its
reliance
on
western
funding
and
foreign
partnerships
and
is
lessening
its
dependence
on
imported
technology
western
sanctions
imposed
in
over
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
have
already
made
it
extremely
hard
for
many
state
oil
firms
such
as
rosneft
to
borrow
abroad
or
use
western
technology
to
develop
shale
offshore
and
arctic
deposits
while
those
measures
have
slowed
down
a
number
of
challenging
oil
projects
they
have
done
little
to
halt
the
russian
industry
s
growth
with
production
near
a
record
high
of
million
barrels
per
day
in
july
and
set
to
climb
further
since
the
russian
oil
industry
has
effectively
halted
borrowing
from
western
institutions
instead
relying
on
its
own
cash
flow
and
lending
from
banks
while
developing
technology
to
replace
services
once
supplied
by
western
firms
analysts
say
this
is
partly
why
russian
oil
stocks
have
been
relatively
unscathed
since
senators
introduced
legislation
to
impose
new
sanctions
on
russia
over
its
interference
in
elections
and
its
activities
in
syria
and
ukraine
the
measures
introduced
on
dubbed
by
the
senators
as
the
bill
from
hell
include
potential
curbs
on
the
operations
of
russian
banks
restrictions
on
holding
russian
sovereign
debt
as
well
as
measures
against
western
involvement
in
russian
oil
and
gas
projects
while
the
ruble
has
fallen
more
than
percent
and
russian
banking
stocks
have
slumped
percent
since
the
legislation
was
introduced
shares
in
russian
oil
firms
have
climbed
percent
leaving
them
percent
higher
so
far
in
the
main
driver
of
the
russian
oil
industry
s
profitability
is
the
oil
price
denominated
in
roubles
and
it
is
currently
posting
new
records
as
the
rouble
is
getting
weaker
hence
the
sanction
noise
often
even
has
a
positive
impact
on
russian
oil
stocks
said
dmitry
marinchenko
at
fitch
ratings
the
prospects
for
the
latest
sanctions
bill
are
not
immediately
clear
it
would
have
to
pass
both
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
and
then
be
signed
into
law
by
president
donald
trump
to
be
sure
washington
could
really
hurt
the
russian
oil
industry
if
it
introduced
measures
forbidding
oil
purchases
from
the
country
but
given
russia
produces
more
than
percent
of
global
crude
such
a
measure
would
lead
to
a
major
spike
in
oil
prices
and
hit
the
united
states
itself
hard
as
it
is
the
world
s
largest
oil
consumer
russian
gas
exporting
monopoly
gazprom
for
example
has
maintained
its
output
since
and
actually
increased
exports
to
europe
to
an
high
in
securing
a
percent
share
of
eu
markets
amid
rising
demand
but
of
all
russian
oil
and
gas
companies
it
is
the
only
one
to
have
borrowed
significant
sums
from
the
west
about
billion
in
and
billion
in
so
far
using
eurobonds
and
syndicated
loans
what
s
more
those
amounts
are
only
equivalent
to
a
small
proportion
of
gazprom
s
annual
capital
spending
of
billion
the
rest
of
the
russian
oil
industry
invests
a
similar
amount
each
year
as
well
mostly
without
western
funding
that
represents
a
major
departure
from
the
years
prior
to
the
sanctions
when
the
lion
s
share
of
russian
oil
industry
s
borrowing
came
from
western
banks
or
facilities
with
trading
houses
and
major
oil
companies
in
for
example
a
year
before
the
first
western
sanctions
rosneft
alone
borrowed
more
than
billion
from
western
institutions
to
buy
smaller
rival
and
to
fund
its
capital
spending
there
has
been
a
similar
shift
in
joint
ventures
between
russian
and
western
companies
a
decade
ago
dozens
of
projects
were
planned
but
the
number
has
shrunk
to
just
a
few
ventures
which
are
important
but
not
critical
to
help
russia
maintain
its
output
growth
oil
giant
exxon
mobil
and
italy
s
eni
for
example
have
dropped
plans
to
help
russia
develop
offshore
fields
and
company
conocophillips
sold
out
from
russia
s
biggest
private
oil
firm
lukoil
the
key
remaining
ventures
involving
western
companies
are
three
projects
between
bp
and
rosneft
in
east
and
west
siberia
and
a
gas
venture
between
rosneft
and
exxon
mobil
on
sakhalin
island
also
on
the
gas
front
royal
dutch
shell
and
france
s
total
have
been
considering
new
liquefied
natural
gas
projects
with
gazprom
and
novatek
as
well
as
a
new
pipeline
to
europe
under
the
baltic
sea
but
to
put
the
projects
in
perspective
the
combined
cost
of
all
of
them
is
about
billion
less
than
a
of
the
russian
oil
industry
s
investment
program
for
the
next
decade
and
if
western
institutions
are
wary
of
lending
to
russia
other
countries
such
as
china
have
been
prepared
to
step
in
novatek
and
total
for
example
launched
the
billion
yamal
lng
plant
this
year
with
beijing
s
financial
support
the
weakest
link
in
the
russian
oil
industry
in
the
face
of
sanctions
has
traditionally
been
western
technology
such
as
complex
drilling
hydraulic
fracturing
or
it
said
denis
borisov
director
of
ey
s
oil
and
gas
center
in
moscow
russia
s
drilling
and
oil
servicing
market
is
worth
about
billion
a
year
and
the
share
of
the
market
held
by
western
service
companies
has
remained
fairly
steady
over
the
last
few
years
and
at
about
a
fifth
but
the
process
of
replacing
foreign
equipment
with
local
production
has
gathered
pace
said
borisov
rosneft
which
produces
percent
of
russian
oil
has
recently
tested
its
own
simulated
hydraulic
fracturing
technology
the
extraction
technique
that
spurred
the
boom
in
shale
oil
production
the
technology
first
came
to
russia
mainly
via
major
western
oil
services
firms
such
as
schlumberger
and
halliburton
companies
such
as
schlumberger
are
still
doing
a
lot
of
complex
drilling
work
in
the
caspian
sea
and
west
siberia
for
lukoil
as
well
as
working
on
the
world
s
longest
extended
reach
well
for
exxon
and
rosneft
off
the
sakhalin
island
but
fitch
s
marinchenko
said
the
reliance
of
russian
oil
firms
on
western
technology
has
declined
since
thanks
to
imports
from
china
and
local
production
of
drilling
equipment
since
rosneft
s
own
drilling
subsidiary
has
doubled
its
market
share
to
percent
meaning
the
company
has
become
almost
self
sufficient
it
is
clear
that
new
sanctions
on
technology
will
not
become
the
start
of
an
end
for
the
russian
oil
industry
especially
if
europe
doesn
t
join
them
said
marinchenko
but
it
will
complicate
the
development
of
hard
to
extract
or
depleted
