an
indonesian
court
has
rejected
a
legal
challenge
from
local
residents
attempting
to
halt
the
expansion
of
a
coal
power
plant
on
the
holiday
island
of
bali
the
environmental
group
greenpeace
said
on
friday
three
residents
near
the
celukan
bawang
power
plant
about
km
miles
from
the
main
tourism
hub
of
denpasar
had
tried
to
stop
the
planned
expansion
due
to
pollution
fears
the
judge
only
used
the
perspective
of
our
opponents
said
didit
wicaksono
a
climate
and
energy
campaigner
at
greenpeace
indonesia
which
backed
the
legal
challenge
we
are
very
sad
about
the
decision
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
adding
that
an
appeal
in
a
higher
court
was
now
planned
the
legal
bid
claimed
that
the
expansion
which
would
more
than
double
power
capacity
at
the
site
would
be
a
setback
to
the
remote
area
s
tourism
and
fishing
industries
the
expansion
would
lead
to
increased
air
and
water
pollution
damage
crops
and
have
a
negative
effect
on
wildlife
at
a
nearby
national
park
argued
the
plaintiffs
in
its
ruling
on
thursday
the
denpasar
administrative
court
said
the
action
had
no
legal
standing
and
that
new
technology
would
be
able
to
mitigate
the
risk
of
pollution
according
to
greenpeace
the
court
also
ruled
that
expansion
work
should
not
be
halted
during
any
appeal
process
wicaksono
said
adding
that
activists
and
community
members
are
planning
to
protest
near
the
plant
pt
general
energy
bali
which
runs
the
celukan
bawang
power
plant
could
not

an

spokesman
said
by

that
the
government
would
respect
the
court
s
ruling
in
a
statement
one
of
the
plaintiffs
i
ketut
mangku
said
that
pollution
from
the
coal
plant
has
negatively
affected
the
health
of
both
his
family
and
his
crops
the
planned
expansion
is
going
to
be
even
more
harmful
with
far
reaching
impact
he
said
indonesia
is
among
the
countries
for
energy
consumption
due
to
a
steadily
increasing
population
economic
development
and
a
rise
in
urbanization
like
other
asian
nations
the
government
faces
the
challenge
of
boosting
electricity
access
while
meeting
its
pledge
to
cut
emissions
under
the
paris
agreement
indonesia
emissions
targets
can
only
be
achieved
by
reducing
its
reliance
on
coal
power
and
ramping
up
investment
in
clean
renewable
energy
projects
