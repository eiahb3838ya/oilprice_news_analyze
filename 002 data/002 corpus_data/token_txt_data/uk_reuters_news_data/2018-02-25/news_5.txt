feb
reuters
the
trump
administration
and
key
asian
allies
are
preparing
to
expand
interceptions
of
ships
suspected
of
violating
sanctions
on
north
korea
a
plan
that
could
include
deploying
coast
guard
forces
to
stop
and
search
vessels
in
waters
senior
officials
said
washington
has
been
talking
to
regional
partners
including
japan
south
korea
australia
and
singapore
about
coordinating
a
crackdown
that
would
go
further
than
ever
before
in
an
attempt
to
squeeze
pyongyang
s
use
of
seagoing
trade
to
feed
its
nuclear
missile
program
several
officials
told
reuters
while
suspect
ships
have
been
intercepted
before
the
emerging
strategy
would
expand
the
scope
of
such
operations
but
stop
short
of
imposing
a
naval
blockade
on
north
korea
pyongyang
has
warned
it
would
consider
a
blockade
an
act
of
war
the
strategy
calls
for
closer
tracking
and
possible
seizure
of
ships
suspected
of
carrying
banned
weapons
components
and
other
prohibited
cargo
to
or
from
north
korea
according
to
the
officials
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
depending
on
the
scale
of
the
campaign
the
united
states
could
consider
beefing
up
the
naval
and
air
power
of
its
pacific
command
they
said
the
initiative
which
has
not
been
previously
reported
shows
washington
s
increasing
urgency
to
force
north
korea
into
negotiations
over
the
abandonment
of
its
weapons
programs
the
officials
said
north
korea
may
be
only
a
few
months
away
from
completing
development
of
a
missile
capable
of
hitting
the
mainland
despite
existing
international
sanctions
that
at
times
have
been
sidestepped
by
smuggling
and
transfers
at
sea
of
banned
goods
according
to
officials
there
is
no
doubt
we
all
have
to
do
more
short
of
direct
military
action
to
show
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
we
mean
business
said
a
senior
administration
official
the
white
house
declined
official
comment
the
effort
could
target
vessels
on
the
high
seas
or
in
the
territorial
waters
of
countries
that
choose
to
cooperate
it
was
unclear
however
to
what
extent
the
campaign
might
extend
beyond
asia
washington
on
friday
slapped
sanctions
on
dozens
more
companies
and
vessels
linked
to
north
korean
shipping
trade
and
urged
the
united
nations
to
blacklist
a
list
of
entities
a
move
it
said
was
aimed
at
shutting
down
north
korea
s
illicit
maritime
smuggling
activities
to
obtain
oil
and
sell
coal
tighter
sanctions
plus
a
more
assertive
approach
at
sea
could
dial
up
tensions
at
a
time
when
fragile
diplomacy
between
north
and
south
korea
has
gained
momentum
it
would
also
stretch
military
resources
needed
elsewhere
possibly
incur
massive
new
costs
and
fuel
misgivings
among
some
countries
in
the
region
the
initiative
which
is
still
being
developed
would
be
fraught
with
challenges
that
could
risk
triggering
north
korean
retaliation
and
dividing
the
international
community
china
and
russia
which
have
blocked
efforts
at
the
united
nations
to
win
approval
for
use
of
force
in
north
korea
interdiction
operations
are
likely
to
oppose
new
actions
if
they
see
the
united
states
as
overstepping
a
chinese
official
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
said
such
steps
should
only
be
taken
under
united
nations
auspices
but
washington
is
expected
to
start
gradually
ratcheting
up
such
operations
soon
even
if
discussions
with
allies
have
not
been
completed
according
to
the
senior
official
experts
are
developing
legal
arguments
for
doing
more
to
stop
vessels
citing
the
last
security
council
resolution
which
they
say
opened
the
door
by
calling
on
states
to
inspect
suspect
ships
on
the
high
seas
or
in
their
waters
washington
is
also
drawing
up
rules
of
engagement
aimed
at
avoiding
armed
confrontation
at
sea
the
officials
said
treasury
secretary
steve
mnuchin
told
reporters
in
washington
on
friday
the
united
states
does
not
rule
out
boarding
ships
for
inspections
but
officials
said
privately
that
such
actions
especially
the
use
of
boarding
crews
would
be
decided
on
a
and
with
utmost
caution
some
officials
believe
the
risk
could
be
minimized
if
coast
guard
cutters
which
carry
less
firepower
and
technically
engage
in
missions
are
used
in
certain
cases
rather
than
warships
the
coast
guard
declined
to
address
whether
it
might
deploy
ships
to
the
region
but
acknowledged
its
ties
to
countries
there
future
ship
deployments
would
depend
on
foreign
policy
objectives
and
the
operational
availability
of
our
assets
said
spokesman
lieutenant
commander
dave
french
a
senior
south
korean
government
official
said
there
had
been
discussions
over
intensified
maritime
interdictions
including
at
a
foreign
ministers
meeting
in
vancouver
last
month
where
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
pressed
counterparts
on
the
issue
we
are
discussing
with
various
countries
including
the
and
south
korea
how
to
fully
implement
the
sanctions
but
i
have
not
heard
talk
of
creating
a
framework
or
a
coalition
said
a
japanese
defense
ministry
official
involved
in
policy
planning
the
trump
administration
has
also
sought
greater
cooperation
from
southeast
asian
countries
which
may
have
little
military
capability
to
assist
but
are
seen
as
sources
of
intelligence
on
ship
movements
officials
said
the
more
partners
we
have
the
more
resources
we
have
to
dedicate
to
the
effort
said
chris
ford
assistant
secretary
of
state
for
international
security
and
nonproliferation
he
declined
to
talk
about
discussions
with
specific
countries
washington
is
especially
interested
in
detecting
of
transfers
at
sea
of
banned
goods
something
north
korea
has
increasingly
resorted
to
as
vessels
have
faced
greater
scrutiny
of
their
cargo
in
asian
ports
the
officials
said
reuters
reported
in
december
that
russian
tankers
had
supplied
fuel
to
north
korea
at
sea
in
a
violation
of
sanctions
washington
also
said
at
the
time
it
had
evidence
that
vessels
from
several
countries
including
china
had
engaged
in
shipping
oil
products
and
coal
china
denied
the
allegation
interception
of
ships
close
to
chinese
waters
is
something
likely
to
be
avoided
in
favor
of
informing
chinese
authorities
of
banned
cargo
onboard
and
asking
them
do
the
inspection
one
official
said
it
s
probably
impossible
to
stop
everything
but
you
can
raise
the
cost
to
north
korea
