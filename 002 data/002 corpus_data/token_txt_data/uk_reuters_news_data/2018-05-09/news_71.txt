crude
oil
prices
jumped
back
to
highs
on
wednesday
after
president
donald
trump
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
while
the
dollar
continued
its
tireless
ascent
and
world
stocks
held
steady
trump
s
move
sparked
worries
about
fresh
tension
in
the
middle
east
and
uncertainty
over
global
oil
supplies
demand
for
assets
remained
limited
however
as
the
price
of
gold
retreated
and
bond
yields
rose
the
treasury
breached
the
key
percent
level
once
more
and
was
last
at
percent
a
high
supported
by
expectations
of
higher
interest
rates
caroline
simmons
deputy
head
of
the
uk
chief
investment
office
at
ubs
wealth
management
said
that
while
generally
central
banks
tend
to
look
through
the
oil
price
in
terms
of
its
impact
on
inflation
it
is
still
of
note
to
market
watchers
in
an
environment
where
the
fed
particularly
is
already
at
its
inflation
target
and
people
are
closely
watching
the
pace
of
the
monetary
tightening
something
like
this
which
could
possibly
nudge
inflation
a
little
bit
higher
is
going
to
be
quite
interesting
for
the
market
simmons
said
that
s
why
you
re
seeing
the
yields
go
up
a
little
bit
on
the
the
impact
of
trump
s
decision
remained
broadly
limited
to
oil
markets
and
stocks
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
futures
hit
their
highest
level
since
november
at
per
barrel
up
percent
brent
crude
futures
jumped
as
much
as
percent
to
a
high
of
there
is
still
an
interim
period
before
sanctions
kick
in
and
other
signatories
and
iran
want
to
keep
the
deal
going
so
there
is
a
period
where
things
could
be
hammered
out
said
benjamin
schroeder
rates
strategist
at
ing
but
i
would
have
expected
a
bit
of
a
bid
this
morning
he
added
referring
to
bonds
the
msci
world
equity
index
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
was
flat
in
percentage
terms
and
continued
to
trade
in
a
narrow
range
the
stoxx
meanwhile
rose
percent
as
oil
majors
gained
and
earnings
from
siemens
and
imperial
brands
dominated
the
market
action
in
the
very
short
term
it
looks
as
if
the
impact
of
heightened
geopolitical
worries
was
limited
to
oil
markets
but
that
is
not
the
end
of
the
story
said
norihiro
fujito
senior
investment
strategist
at
mitsubishi
ufj
morgan
stanley
securities
sanctions
could
affect
various
industries
and
tensions
between
iran
and
israel
look
set
to
intensify
those
will
begin
to
cap
share
prices
he
added
the
reaction
in
asian
markets
was
more
pronounced
as
renewed
sanctions
on
tehran
were
seen
as
disruptive
for
many
companies
that
have
deals
with
iran
trump
s
move
is
also
seen
as
likely
to
worsen
relations
between
iran
and
allies
in
the
region
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
was
flat
while
japan
s
nikkei
fell
percent
iran
the
producer
among
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
produces
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
or
about
percent
of
the
world
s
oil
supplies
the
treasury
said
it
will
reimpose
a
wide
array
of
sanctions
after
the
expiry
of
and
periods
including
those
aimed
at
iran
s
oil
sector
and
transactions
with
its
central
bank
the
rise
in
treasury
yields
helped
fuel
the
dollar
s
rally
with
the
greenback
trading
at
a
fresh
high
for
the
dollar
s
index
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
was
last
up
at
and
has
risen
percent
so
far
this
year
souring
risk
sentiment
is
hitting
emerging
markets
which
have
been
clobbered
in
recent
weeks
by
concerns
about
capital
outflows
as
the
prospect
of
higher
interest
rates
lures
investors
back
to
bonds
rather
than
riskier
assets
countries
with
high
perceived
political
risks
such
as
brazil
and
turkey
were
among
the
worst
hit
the
brazilian
real
hit
a
near
low
and
the
turkish
lira
reached
a
record
low
since
the
start
of
this
week
those
currencies
are
both
down
around
percent
the
indonesian
rupiah
hit
a
low
and
has
slid
percent
this
week
among
major
currencies
the
australian
dollar
hit
an
low
of
and
last

continued
to
slide
to
a
fresh
low
of
and
last
stood
at
having
declined
more
than
percent
in
the
past
three
weeks
the
currency
was
hit
by
increasing
prospects
of
another
election
in
italy
as
the
political
impasse
there
has
continued
since
early
march
s
inconclusive
ballot
the
british
pound
stood
at
near
a
low
of
touched
on
tuesday
the
dollar
rose

to
yen
edging
near
its
high
