california
s
electric
grid
operator
has
forecast
power
supplies
will
be
tight
this
summer
due
to
below
average
hydropower
production
and
reduced
generation
according
to
an
assessment
released
on
wednesday
the
california
independent
system
operator
iso
the
grid
operator
said
the
system
s
capacity
to
serve
consumers
will
be
tight
in
periods
in
the
summer
months
especially
during
the
evenings
of
hot
days
when
solar
power
dissipates
but
it
forecast
only
an
extremely
low
probability
it
will
be
forced
to
initiate
rotating
power
outages
this
summer
the
iso
which
forecast
peak
demand
during
the
summer
would
be
about
the
same
as
last
year
said
hydropower
production
is
expected
to
be
down
megawatts
mw
by
late
summer
compared
with
s
hydropower
output
one
megawatt
can
power
about
homes
in
addition
the
iso
said
natural
generation
will
see
a
drop
of
about
mw
due
to
plant
retirements
the
iso
assessment
came
a
few
days
after
a
group
of
state
regulators
and
regional
power
firms
including
the
iso
released
a
technical
report
warning
of
a
moderate
threat
to
gas
and
electric
reliability
this
summer
and
a
more
serious
threat
next
winter
because
the
southern
california
gas
socalgas
system
is
operating
at
less
than
full
capacity
socalgas
cautioned
that
pipeline
outages
and
restrictions
on
its
giant
aliso
canyon
gas
storage
facility
in
los
angeles
which
suffered
a
devastating
leak
between
october
and
february
could
reduce
its
ability
to
deliver
gas
to
fuel
power
generation
facilities
in
southern
california
this
summer
and
winter
socalgas
is
a
unit
of
california
energy
company
sempra
energy
the
iso
projected
there
will
be
mw
of
generation
available
to
serve
demand
this
summer
with
peak
usage
expected
to
reach
mw
under
normal
conditions
if
temperatures
are
warmer
than
normal
as
they
were
last
year
the
iso
said
supply
margins
will
tighten
significantly
as
consumers
crank
up
their
air
conditioners
last
year
peak
demand
hit
mw
in
september
the
california
department
of
water
resources
said
water
content
of
snowpack
in
the
mountains
was
just
percent
of
average
as
of
april
in
addition
the
iso
said
mw
of
generation
retired
since
last
summer
including
mw
of
resources
energy
firms
added
mw
of
new
power
sources
since
last
year
but
percent
of
that
was
solar
which
will
not
supply
much
when
supplies
are
tight
in
the
evenings
