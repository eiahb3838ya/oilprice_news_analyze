follow

of
enbridge
s
preferred
route
enbridge
said
that
if
it
were
to
follow
the
recommended
route
the

pipeline
would
need
to
be
shut
down

nine

months
negatively
impacting
minnesota
s
energy
the
c
billion
line
replacement
would
double

said
its
longstanding
history
with
enbridge
and
the
fund
s
desire
to
grow
its
renewables
exposure
led
to
the
agreement
we
were
having
conversations
about
a
broader
arrangement
and
the
ability
to
grow
value
over
time
which
was
a
much
more
sellable
package
to
enbridge
than
they
initially
envisaged
he
said
the
pension
fund
will
also
provide
c
million
