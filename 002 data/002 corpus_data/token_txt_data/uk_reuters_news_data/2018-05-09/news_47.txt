the
idea
of
a
agreement
that
would
preserve
the
central
pillars
of
the
jcpoa
while
addressing
other
issues
beyond
the
nuclear
programme
the
central
idea
is
that
around
the
core
of
the
jcpoa
you
build
a
a
agreement
that
would
address
the
problems

administration
took
office
we
made
the
case
for
keeping
the
jcpoa
at
every
level
he
said
the
decision
makes
no
difference
to
the
british
assessment
that
the
constraints
imposed
on
iran
s
nuclear
ambitions
by
the
jcpoa
remain
vital
for
our
national
security
and
the
stability
of
the
middle
east
for
as
long
as
iran
abides
by
the
agreement

will
remain
a
party
to
the
jcpoa
he
added
britain
has
no
intention
