oil
prices
are
at
risk
for
further
gains
due
to
the
united
states
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
iran
nuclear
agreement
coupled
with
rising
tensions
in
other
countries
such
as
saudi
arabia
and
venezuela
goldman
sachs
said
in
a
note
wednesday
the
investment
bank
s
current
forecast
is
for
brent
crude
to
hit
a
barrel
by
the
summer
it
is
currently
trading
around
a
barrel
the
harsher
approach
by
the
united
states
could
result
in
an
initial
loss
of
about
barrels
a
day
bpd
in
iran
s
output
which
is
currently
million
bpd
such
a
loss
would
boost
oil
prices
by
about
per
barrel
goldman
said
such
elevated
oil
geopolitical
risks
exacerbate
the
upside
risks
to
brent
forecasts
and
reinforce
our
view
that
oil
price
volatility
will
continue
to
increase
