foundation
builders
in
california
will
be
required
to
fit
solar
panels
on
most
new
homes
from
under
new
building
standards
adopted
on
wednesday
a
move
that
is
the
first
in
the
united
states
and
could
provide
a
big
boost
to
the
solar
industry
the
decision
adopted
unanimously
by
the
california
energy
commission
is
part
of
the
state
s
effort
to
fight
global
climate
change
it
came
despite
estimates
it
would
raise
the
cost
of
a
new
home
by
nearly
in
one
of
the
most
expensive
parts
of
the
country
the
commission
estimated
the
standards
will
add
about
to
monthly
mortgage
payments
but
will
compensate
for
that
by
saving
residents
a
month
on
energy
bills
we
can
not
let
californians
be
in
homes
that
are
essentially
the
residential
equivalent
of
gas
guzzlers
commissioner
david
hochschild
said
ahead
of
the
vote
the
new
building
codes
include
updates
to
building
ventilation
and
lighting
standards
they
are
collectively
expected
to
reduce
the
state
s
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
metric
tons
over
three
years
a
level
equal
to
taking
cars
off
the
road
according
to
state
officials
the
vote
was
a
major
win
for
the
solar
installation
industry
which
already
counts
california
as
its
biggest
market
demand
for
solar
equipment
in
california
could
rise
by
percent
to
percent
because
of
the
new
standards
the
energy
commission
forecast
in
a
study
earlier
this
year
solar
companies
cheered
the
move
saying
they
hoped
such
requirements
would
one
day
be
adopted
in
other
states
too
we
think
it
s
another
example
of
california
policy
preceding
what
will
happen
in
other
markets
tom
werner
chief
executive
of
san
solar
company
sunpower
said
in
an
interview
ahead
of
the
decision
california
has
one
of
the
most
ambitious
renewable
energy
mandates
in
the
country
with
a
goal
of
sourcing
half
of
its
electricity
needs
from
renewable
sources
by
at
the
end
of
it
had
reached
about
percent
according
to
the
cec
because
of
such
policies
the
most
populous
state
has
frequently
been
at
odds
with
president
donald
trump
s
aggressive
rollback
of
policies
to
combat
climate
change
governor
jerry
brown
is
planning
a
global
climate
summit
this
september
just
percent
of
detached
homes
in
the
state
of
million
people
currently
have
solar
panels
according
to
a
department
of
energy
report
the
energy
commission
cited
buildings
that
are
shaded
or
have
a
roof
that
is
too
small
to
accommodate
panels
will
be
among
those
exempt
