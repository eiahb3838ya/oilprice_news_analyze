in 1990s redux, eu to consider blocking u.s. sanctions over iran
brussels
reuters
in
when
the
united
states
tried
to
penalise
foreign
companies
trading
with
cuba
the
european
union
forced
washington
to
back
down
by
threatening
retaliatory
sanctions
two
decades
later
the
european
union
is
being
driven
to
threaten
such
measures
again
over
iran
and
this
time
may
follow
through
after
president
donald
trump
withdrew
from
the
nuclear
pact
between
iran
and
world
powers
and
reimposed
an
array
of
wide
sanctions
on
the
islamic
republic
this
left
dismayed
european
allies
scrambling
to
salvage
the
international
nuclear
pact
as
tehran
said
trump
had
made
a
mistake
and
proved
washington
could
not
be
trusted
the
eu
s
blocking
statute
is
the
most
powerful
tool
at
its
immediate
disposal
because
it
bans
any
eu
company
from
complying
with
sanctions
and
does
not
recognise
any
court
rulings
that
enforce
american
penalties
but
it
has
never
been
used
and
is
seen
by
european
governments
more
as
a
political
weapon
than
a
regulation
because
its
rules
are
vague
and
difficult
to
enforce
serving
mainly
as
a
warning
to
the
united
states
the
international
reach
of
the
financial
system
and
the
presence
of
many
european
companies
also
raise
questions
about
its
effectiveness
it
is
a
technical
tool
that
worked
with
president
bill
clinton
because
it
was
coupled
with
a
political
strategy
said
one
senior
eu
source
involved
in
iran
negotiations
referring
to
clinton
s
decision
to
waive
sanctions
on
eu
companies
related
to
cuba
iran
and
libya
eu
officials
say
they
are
revamping
the
blocking
statute
to
encompass
trump
s
may
decision
to
revive
sanctions
after
the
expiry
of
and
periods
including
sanctions
aimed
at
iran
s
lifeblood
oil
sector
and
transactions
with
its
central
bank
the
blocking
statute
is
one
of
the
main
options
it
s
being
updated
to
make
it
ready
said
a
second
senior
eu
official
european
commissioners
are
expected
to
decide
whether
to
go
ahead
next
week
in
brussels
setting
the
stage
for
eu
government
leaders
to
take
a
final
decision
at
a
summit
in
sofia
on
may
but
diplomats
say
it
will
be
difficult
to
gain
the
agreement
of
all
eu
states
the
blocking
statute
threat
has
less
weight
than
in
clinton
s
era
because
sanctions
targeting
financial
transactions
have
become
more
robust
and
costly
for
eu
firms
european
companies
with
big
operations
in
the
united
states
such
as
shell
are
pressuring
their
governments
instead
to
pursue
waivers
on
a
basis
europeans
are
most
worried
about
how
to
sustain
incentives
for
iran
to
stick
to
the
groundbreaking
accord
signed
by
world
powers
in
july
which
lifted
international
sanctions
on
iran
in
in
return
for
tehran
shutting
down
its
capacity
under
strict
surveillance
by
the
nuclear
watchdog
to
stockpile
enriched
uranium
for
a
possible
atomic
bomb
trump
denounced
the
accord
completed
under
his
predecessor
barack
obama
as
a
horrible
deal
that
should
have
never
ever
been
made
as
it
did
not
cover
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
or
its
role
in
middle
east
conflicts
the
deal
s
proponents
say
it
is
crucial
to
forestalling
a
nuclear
iran
and
preventing
wider
war
in
the
middle
east
the
issue
of
incentives
to
keep
iran
in
the
deal
is
completely
absent
from
thinking
in
meeting
with
diplomats
it
s
all
about
confrontation
and
isolation
of
tehran
another
official
said
without
the
carrot
of
economic
benefits
the
eu
worries
it
will
also
lose
influence
over
iran
once
iran
s
top
trading
partner
and
its
oil
customer
the
eu
has
sought
to
pour
hundreds
of
billions
of
euros

islamic
republic
since
the

along
with
the
united
nations
and
united

blanket
economic
sanctions

lamed
