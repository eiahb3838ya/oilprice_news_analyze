eye
with
its

fpm
seats
the
fpm
founded
by
maronite
christian
politician
michel
aoun
has
been
a
political
ally
of
hezbollah
since
the
alliance
is
particularly
important
to
hezbollah
because
the
fpm
is
the
biggest
christian
force
in
parliament
hezbollah
s
backing
for
aoun
was
vital
to
his
bid
to
become
head
of
state
a
goal
he
finally
realised
in
in
a
political
deal
that
saw
saad
become
prime
minister
aoun
has
said
hezbollah
s
weapons
are
critical
to
the
defence
of
lebanon
in
an
interview
last
year
he
said
the
lebanese
army
was
not
strong
enough
to
confront
israel
and
so
hezbollah
s
arms
were
a
necessity
aoun
said
on
tuesday
he
intended
to
call
a
national
dialogue
to
address
issues
including
a
national
defence
strategy
a
phrase
that
implies
discussion
of
hezbollah
s
arms
but
without
giving
further
details
his
fpm
leader
gebran
bassil
came
under
fire
in
lebanon
last
year
for
saying
lebanon
did
not
have
an
ideological
problem
with
israel
but
in
his
role
as
foreign
minister
bassil
has
acted
in
hezbollah
s
interests
at
the
arab
league
nasrallah
said
in

the
fpm
alliance
remained
strong

this
did

began
disintegrating
after
the
election

suffered
from
waning
saudi
support
hariri
still
wants
hezbollah
disarmed
but
says
this
is
an
issue
that
should
be
resolved
by
dialogue

the
regional
level

hezbollah
s
most
significant
christian
opponent

lf
which
emerged
from

powerful

also
been
fiercely
critical
of
