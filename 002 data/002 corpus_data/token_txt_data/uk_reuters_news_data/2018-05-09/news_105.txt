oil
prices
pushed
higher
in
early
trading
on
wednesday
after
president
donald
trump
walked
away
from
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
a
move
that
may
curb
the
s
crude
exports
in
an
already
tight
market
trump
on
tuesday
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
that
was
agreed
in
late
raising
the
risk
of
conflict
in
the
middle
east
and
casting
uncertainty
over
global
oil
supplies
brent
crude
oil
futures
were
at
per
barrel
at
gmt
up
or
percent
from
their
last
close
and
not
far
off
monday
s
the
highest
since
late
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
futures
were
up
per
barrel
or
percent
at
a
barrel
also
close
to
highs
last
seen
in
late
the
big
event
of
the
night
was
president
trump
s
cancelling
of
the
nuclear
deal
made
with
iran
back
in
sanctions
will
therefore
likely
be
reimposed
on
iran
which
will
ultimately
affect
iran
s
oil
exports
said
william
o
loughlin
investment
analyst
at
australia
s
rivkin
securities
iran
as
a
major
oil
exporter
in
after
international
sanctions
against
it
were
lifted
in
return
for
curbs
on
iran
s
nuclear
programme
with
its
april
exports
standing
at
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
this
makes
iran
the
third
biggest
exporter
of
crude
within
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
behind
saudi
arabia
and
iraq
walking
away
from
the
deal
means
that
the
united
states
will
likely
sanctions
against
iran
after
days
unless
some
other
agreement
is
reached
before
then
anz
bank
said
trump
s
decision
puts
into
place
a
scenario
that
could
see
the
crude
oil
market
tighten
significantly
in
and
into
next
iran
s
exports
of
oil
to
asia
and
europe
will
almost
certainly
decline
later
this
year
and
into
as
some
nations
seek
alternatives
in
order
to
avoid
trouble
with
washington
and
as
sanctions
start
to
bite
despite
this
it
is
not
yet
clear
how
strongly
global
oil
markets
will
be
affected
the
united
states
buys
no
iranian
oil
while
the
other
signatories
of
the
agreement
russia
britain
france
and
germany
are
opposed
to
ending
the
agreement
and
may
continue
to
buy
iranian
crude
asia
by
far
the
biggest
importer
of
oil
from
iran
will
likely
continue
to
take
in
some
supplies
as
well
as
it
did
during
the
previous
round
of
sanctions
there
are
worries
that
iran
s
oil
exports
could
fall
by
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
from
current
levels
said
tomomichi
akuta
senior
economist
at
mitsubishi
ufj
research
and
consulting
in
tokyo
the
oil
balance
is
roughly
in
balance
now
but
it
could
turn
to
a
complete
supply
shortage
in
case
of
new
supply
curbs
oil
prices
could
rise
at
least
a
barrel
with
brent
approaching
near
