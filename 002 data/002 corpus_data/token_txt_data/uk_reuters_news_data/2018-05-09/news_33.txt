big gulf arab economies may be winners as u.s. exits iran deal
dubai

surging
oil
prices
mean
the
big
arab
countries
of
the
gulf
especially
saudi
arabia
look
set
to
gain
financially
as
well
as
politically
from
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
pull
out
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
in
saudi
arabia
was
willing
to
see
oil
prices
tumble
during
a
supply
glut
partly
diplomats
said
because
cheaper
oil
cut
the
income
of
iran
limiting
tehran
s
capacity
to
finance
proxy
wars
against
saudi
interests
in
the
region
it
was
a
painful
which
also
hurt
the
saudi
economy
now
riyadh
faces
an
ideal
situation
trump
s
decision
appears
likely
to
reduce
iran
s
oil
income
while
giving
the
gulf
arab
states
room
to
boost
their
own
energy
exports
monica
malik
chief
economist
at
abu
dhabi
commercial
bank
said
saudi
arabia
s
ambitious
reform
program
which
aims
to
create
jobs
and
new
industries
while
curbing
a
huge
state
budget
deficit
could
benefit
saudi
arabia
may
be
able
to
start
increasing
oil
production
at
a
time
when
oil
prices
are
already
high
this
gives
them
extra
funds
to
support
their
investment
program
while
still
showing
a
narrowing
of
the
a
united
arab
emirates
economic
official
agreed
trump
s
decision
could
help
arab
oil
exporting
economies
higher
oil
income
would
improve
liquidity
in
the
uae
banking
sector
aiding
the
whole
financial
industry
despite
any
rise
in
geopolitical
tensions
related
to
iran
he
told
reuters
the
impact
on
iran
s
oil
exports
will
depend
on
how
buyers
in
asia
and
europe
react
to
sanctions
which
may
not
be
clear
for
months
but
analysts
estimate
iranian
oil
production
could
drop
by
between
and
million
barrels
per
day
from
about
million
bpd
saudi
arabia
is
expected
to
fill
much
of
that
gap
on
wednesday
a
saudi
energy
official
indicated
riyadh
might
raise
output
to
offset
any
supply
shortage
malik
estimated
saudi
oil
revenues
billion
riyals
billion
in
could
be
to
percent
higher
this
year
than
they
would
have
been
without
trump
s
decision
that
assumes
saudi
oil
output
will
average
million
bpd
this
year
instead
of
million
bpd
and
that
increased
geopolitical
tensions
will
lift
this
year
s
average
oil
price
a
barrel
in
other
possibly
smaller
ways
trump
s
decision
is
bad
news
for
some
countries
in
the
gulf
european
countries
are
trying
to
preserve
the
nuclear
deal
but
it
could
collapse
entirely
raising
the
danger
of
worse
conflict
in
the
region
this
will
impact
how
the
region
is
viewed
by
foreign
investors
there
will
be
more
negativity
more
highlighting
of
the
risks
said
one
uae
banker
most
regional
stock
markets
fell
on
wednesday
with
the
saudi
index
sinking
percent
after
yemen
s
houthi
forces
said
they
fired
ballistic
missiles
at
riyadh
saudi
authorities
said
they
intercepted
the
missiles
dubai
traditionally
a
center
for
iranian
business
may
suffer
as
companies
already
cautious
about
trading
with
iran
become
more
so
because
they
see
a
greater
risk
of
legal
action
against
them
the
uae
s
exports
to
iran
are
worth
about
percent
of
its
gross
domestic
product
oman
which
has
been
hoping
iranian
investment
will
support
industrial
expansion
plans
may
suffer
last
year
oman
s
central
bank
signed
a
memorandum
of
understanding
with
its
iranian
counterpart
in
order
to
boost
trade
but
much
trade
with
iran
is
expected
to
continue
possibly
through
barter
deals
which
flourished
under
sanctions
that
prevailed
before
the
nuclear
deal
took
effect
in
and
apart
from
dubai
and
oman
the
wealthy
gulf
oil
exporting
states
have
minimal
trade
and
investment
links
with
iran
meaning
they
have
little
to
lose
shares
in
saudi
food
producer
savola
group
one
of
the
few
gulf
firms
with
big
manufacturing
operations
in
iran
fell
only
percent
on
wednesday
and
remained
up
percent
suggesting
investors
do
not
foresee
disaster
for
its
iranian
business
but
a
tumble
of
iran
s
rial
to
record
lows
against
the
dollar
in
the
free
currency
market
on
wednesday
showed
many
iranians
expect
tough
economic
times
well
before
trump
s
decision
the
economy
was
struggling
with
high
unemployment
estimated
at
around
percent
or
higher
among
young
people
and
a
banking
system
which
may
be
close
to
insolvency
the
move
threatens
iran
with
lower
export
income
and
less
access
to
hard
currency
analysts
expect
oil
exports
to
remain
higher
than
they
were
before
so
the
economy
may
muddle
through
but
banks
problems
mean
a
financial
crisis
is
not
impossible
mehrdad
emadi
an
iranian
economist
who
heads
energy
risk
analysis
at
london
s
betamatrix
consultancy
said
the
currency
market
turmoil
in
some
ways
resembled
this
year
s
instability
in
venezuela
and
argentina
s
currency
crisis
simply
put
the
economy
is
like
a
giant

a
heavy
