last

in
november
after
trump
on
tuesday
abandoned
the
deal
and
announced
the
highest
level
of
sanctions
against
iran
trump
s
move
raises
the
risk
of
conflict
in

and
casts
uncertainty
over
oil

on

arone
said
now
we
re
starting
to
see
that

close

this
could
be
a

a

by

over

the

the
notion
that

have
peaked
arone
said
those
things
certainly
have
the
market
in
a
bit
of
a
sideways
pattern
he
said
the
dollar
fell
from
its
strongest
levels
in
against
a
basket
of
currencies
due
to
mild
but
the
greenback
was
expected
to
resume
its
rise
due
to
solid
economic
growth
and
further
monetary
tightening
by
the
fed
the
weaker
dollar
stemmed
from
a
bounce
in
the
euro
which
hit
a
fresh
low
for
the
year
in
early

before
paring

there
s
a
little
exhaustion
with
the
