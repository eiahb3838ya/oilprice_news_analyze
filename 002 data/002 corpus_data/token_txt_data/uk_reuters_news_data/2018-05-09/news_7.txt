its

more

last
seen
in
november
after
trump
on
tuesday
abandoned
the
deal
and
announced
the
highest
level
of
sanctions
against
iran
trump
s
action
raises
the
risk
of
conflict
in
the
middle
east
and
casts
uncertainty
over
oil
supplies
in
an
already
tight

which
helped
their
gains
on
wednesday
arone
said
now
we
re
starting
to
see
that

close
so
this
could
be
a
bit
of
a
rally
for
the

range
on
concerns
about
trade
negotiations
differing
views
by
the
federal

and
investors
over
inflation
and
the
economy
and
the
notion
that
earnings
and
growth
have
peaked
arone
said
those
things
certainly
have
the
market
in
a
bit
of
a
sideways
pattern
he
said
the
dollar
fell
from
its
strongest
levels
in
against
a
basket
of
currencies
because
of
mild
but
the
greenback
was
expected
to
resume
its
rise
as
a
result
of
solid
economic
growth
and
further
monetary
tightening
by
the
fed
a
bounce
in
the
euro
which
dropped
to
a
low
for
the
year
in
early
trading
helped
weaken
the
dollar
there
s
a
little
exhaustion
with
the
trade
but
i
don
t
think
we

reached
the
end
of
it
yet

the
