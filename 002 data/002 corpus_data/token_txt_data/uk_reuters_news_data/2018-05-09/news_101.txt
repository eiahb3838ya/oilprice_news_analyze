crude

prices
jumped
back
to
near
highs
on
wednesday
after

donald
trump
pulled
his

out

an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
sparking
worries
about

on
tehran
were
seen
as
disruptive

is
also
seen
as
risking
worsening
relations
between
iran
and
allies
in
the
region
in
the
very
short
term
it
looks
as
if
the
impact
of
heightened
geopolitical
worries
was
limited
to
oil
markets

that
is
not
the
end
of
the
story
