urged
the
united
states
on
wednesday
not
to
abandon

a
partnership
with
leaders
perpetuating
endless
war
we
are
asking
the
united
states
not
to
abandon
this
country
south
sudan
because
we
need
them
their
role
to

not
be
ignored

has
been
in
the

of
a
civil
war
since
late

has
displaced
around
a
third
of
the
populaton
and
killed
tens
of
thousands
of
people
in
a
sharply
worded
statement
on
tuesday
the

said
the
united
states
was
a
proud
and
hopeful
supporter
of
south
sudan
when
it
gained
independence
in
seven
years
later
the
leaders
of
this
country
have
squandered
this
partnership
killed
their
own
people
and
repeatedly
demonstrated
their
inability
and
unwillingness
to
live
up
to
their
commitments
to
end
the
country
s
civil
the
funding
provides
aid
to
millions
of
south
sudanese
refugees
in
uganda

lifesaving

such
as
food
to
people
still
inside
the
country
washington
s
statement
says
the
united
states
is
committed
to
saving
lives

does
not
want
its

prolong
the
conflict

elites

being
produced
juba
spends
well
more
than
half
ifs

according
to
experts
washington
should
reconsider
whatever
harsh
matter
they
are
taking
against
this
country

led
by
president
salva

is
fighting

a
number
of
rebel

some
of
them
loyal
to

under
house
arrest
in

it
was
violated
within
hours
a
new
round
of
talks
is
scheduled
to
begin
later

month
after
delays
but
there
is
little
hope
among
diplomats
it
will
end
the
war
the
government
of
south
sudan
has
lost
credibility
and
the
united
states
is
losing
patience
