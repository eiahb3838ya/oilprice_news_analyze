the

states
will
continue
working
with
its
allies
to
ensure
iran
does
not
acquire
a
nuclear
weapon
defense
secretary
jim
mattis
said
on
wednesday
a
day
after
president
donald
trump
withdrew
from
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
tehran
we
will
continue
to
work
alongside
our
allies
and
partners
to
ensure
that
iran
can
never
acquire
a
nuclear
weapon
and
will
work
with
others
to
address
the
range
of
iran
s
malign
influence
mattis
said
in
a
hearing
before
the
senate
appropriations
committee
this
administration
remains
committed
to
putting
the
safety
interests
and
of
our
citizens
first
mattis
said
trump
on
tuesday
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
the
nuclear
deal
with
iran
raising
the
risk
of
conflict
in
the
middle
east
upsetting
european
allies
and
casting
uncertainty
over
global
oil
supplies
the
agreement
worked
out
by
the
united
states
five
other
world
powers
and
iran
lifted
sanctions
on
tehran
in
exchange
for
its
agreement
to
limit
its
nuclear
program
the
pact
was
designed
to
prevent
iran
from
obtaining
a
nuclear
bomb
trump
s
decision
has
intensified
the
strain
on
the
alliance
since
he
took
office
months
ago
a
number
of
european
leaders
came
to
washington
ahead
of
trump
s
decision
on
tuesday
to
plead
with
him
to
preserve
the
deal
the
trump
administration
kept
the
door
open
to
negotiating
another
deal
with
allies
but
it
is
far
from
clear
if
the
europeans
would
agree
to
that
approach
and
if
they
could
convince
iran
to
accept
it
last
year
mattis
said
the
united
states
should
consider
staying
in
the
iran
nuclear
deal
unless
it
was
proven
that
tehran
was
not
abiding
by
the
agreement
or
that
it
was
not
in
the
national
interest
to
do
so
in
the
hearing
on
wednesday
mattis
said
trump
s
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
deal
had
not
been
a
hasty
one
the
president
could
not
affirm
as
required
that
this
agreement
was
being
lived
up
to
and
in
the
best
interest
in
all
aspects
of
what
was
supposed
to
be
happening
under
the
jcpoa
mattis
said
using
an
acronym
for
the
joint
comprehensive
plan
of
action
the
formal
name
of
the
nuclear
deal
with
iran
i
think
we
now
have
the
opportunity
to
move
forward
to
address
those
shortcomings
and
make
it
more
compelling
mattis
said
he
added
that
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
and
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
were
working
on
the
issue
