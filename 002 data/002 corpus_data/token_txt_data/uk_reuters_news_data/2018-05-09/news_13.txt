edf
said
improved
availability
of
its
french
nuclear
power
stations
and
higher

boosted

percent
to
billion
euros
chief
financial
officer
xavier
girre
told
analysts
that
edf
expects
the
french
state
council
to
decide
on
regulated
power
tariffs
in
coming
weeks
after
an
adviser
to
the
council
last
week
recommended
scrapping
the
tariffs
under
which
edf
sells
power
to
most
of
its
clients
he
declined
to
comment
on
the
possible
impact
for
edf
a
decade
after
the
french
power
market
was
opened
to
competition
edf
still
sells
about
percent
of
all
electricity
in
france
with
competitors
such
as
direct
energie
trying
to
woo
clients
with
offers
the
scrapping
of
regulated
tariffs
could
speed
up
the
client
exodus
at
edf
which
lost
nearly
million
customers
last
year
edf
said
nuclear
electricity
production
in
france
rose
percent
to
twh
in
line
with
its
forecast
for
nuclear
output
greater
than
twh
in
as
nearly
all
its
reactors
are
now
back
on
line
following
a
series
of
outages
last
year
the
company
also
confirmed
its
earnings
guidance
for
core
earnings
of
to
billion
euros
and
cash
flow
that
is
slightly
positive
or
close
to
balance
excluding
investments
in
its
linky
smart
meters
and

uk
sales
up
percent
to
billion

and
sales
in
italy
were
up
percent
to
billion

edf
also
for
the
first
time
detailed
the
revenues
of
its
dalkia
energy
services
unit
and
its
edf
energies
nouvelles
unit
which
had
revenues
of
billion
euros
and
million
euros
respectively
while
overall
sales
were
up
percent
from
a
restated
billion
euros
in
they
were
down
percent
compared
to
the
billion
euro
revenue
published
a
year
ago
girre
said
new
accounting
rules
no
longer
allow
edf
to
recognise
the
delivery
component
of
energy
supply
contracts
and
some
market
trading
activities
as
revenue
the
revenue
reduction
is
offset
by
a
similar
reduction
in
fuel
and
energy
purchases
and
will
have
no
impact
on
core
earnings
