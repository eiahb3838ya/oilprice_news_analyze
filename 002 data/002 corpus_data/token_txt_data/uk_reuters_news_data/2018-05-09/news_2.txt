the
highest
level
of
sanctions
against
iran
trump
s
action
raises
the
risk
of
conflict
in
the
middle
east
and
casts
uncertainty
over
oil
supplies
in
an
already
tight
market
crude
rose

range
on
concerns
about
trade
negotiations
differing
views
between
the

over
inflation
and
the
economy
and
the
notion
that

and
growth
have
peaked
arone
said
those
things
certainly
have
the
market
in
a
bit
of
a
sideways
pattern
he
said
the
dollar
fell
from
its
strongest
levels
in
against
a
basket
of
currencies
because
of
mild
but
the
greenback
was
expected
to
resume
its
rise
as
a
result
of
solid
economic
growth
and
further
monetary
tightening
by
the
