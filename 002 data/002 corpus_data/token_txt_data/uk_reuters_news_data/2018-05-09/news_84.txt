france
s
foreign
minister
said
on
wednesday
the
iran
deal
was
not
dead
despite
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
pull
out
and
french
president
emmanuel
macron
would
speak
to
his
iranian

that
france
wanted
to
stick
to
the

with
world
powers
in
a
pact
which
he
said
iran
had
honoured

meeting
would
be
followed
by
talks
between
the
iranians
and
britain
and
germany
as
well
as
france
le
drian
said
meetings
would
also
be
held
with
the
likes
of
oil
giant
total
and
others
with
major
business
and
economic
stakes
in
the
region
he
added
the
deal
is
not
dead
there
s
an
american
withdrawal
from
the
deal
but
the
deal
is
still
there
he
said
the
region
deserves
better
than
further
destabilisation
provoked
by
american
withdrawal
so
we
want
to
adhere
to
it
and
see
to
it
that
iran
does
too
that
iran
behaves
with
the
agreement
worked
out
by
the
united
states
france
germany
britain
russia
china
and
iran
lifted
sanctions
on
iran
in
exchange
for
tehran
limiting
its
nuclear
programme
the
pact
was
designed
to
prevent
iran
from
obtaining
a
nuclear
bomb
trump
said
on
tuesday
he
would
reimpose
economic
sanctions
on
iran
as
he
pulled
out
of
a
horrible
deal
that
should
have
never
ever
been
made
other
countries
that
helped
iran
develop
its
nuclear
programme
would
also
face
sanctions
he
added
britain
germany
and
france
have
already
urged
the
united
states
not
to
take
steps
that
would
make
life
harder
for
other
countries
that
still
want
to
stick
to
the
pact
separately
french
finance
minister
bruno
le
maire
told
french
radio
that
trump
s
decision
on
iran
was
a
mistake
and
that
the
united
states
should
not
consider
itself
as
the
world
s
economic
policeman
le
drian
said
france
like
others
was
well
aware
that
there
were
concerns
about
issues
beyond
iran
s
nuclear
capability
namely
its
ballistic
weapons
programme
but
said
they
could
be
addressed
without
ditching
the
nuclear
deal
yes
there
is
a
real
risk
of
confrontation
he
told
rtl
regarding
trump
s
decision
on
iran
i
hope
it
will
not
be
a
setback
for
peace
he
added
le
drian
said
that
regular
reports
by
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
had
showed
iran
was
complying
with
the
agreement
