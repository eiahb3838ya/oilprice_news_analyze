update 1-eu defence of iran deal brings companies little relief
reuters
european
governments
vowed
on
wednesday
to
try
to
shield
their
improved
economic
ties
with
iran
from
the
impact
of
renewed
sanctions
but
business
leaders
struck
a
more
pessimistic
note
the
eu
said
it
remained
committed
to
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
the
suspension
of
its
own
sanctions
the
day
after
president
donald
trump
announced
washington
s
withdrawal
from
the
pact
french
foreign
minister
le
drian
also
insisted
the
deal
was
not
dead
however
companies
with
active
iranian
investments
or
plans
mostly
stayed
quiet
on
the
viability
of
those
projects
beyond
a
period
of
three
to
six
months
until
the
united
states
reimposes
sanctions
on
entities
doing
business
with
tehran
siemens
is
still
assessing
the
implications
of
the
iran
decision
the
german
industrial
giant
s
chief
financial
officer
ralf
thomas
told
reporters
on
a
call
one
of
the
strongest
industrialised
countries
in
the
world
has
made
a
political
decision
as
an
industrial
company
we
have
to
recognise
that
thomas
said
existing
projects
will
be
completed
as
far
as
legally
possible
he
added
trump
s
move
will
lead
to
the
reimposition
of
penalties
that
were
waived
under
the
nuclear
deal
including
financial
sanctions
that
had
made
it
extremely
difficult
for
global
companies
to
do
business
with
or
in
iran
companies
worst
affected
are
likely
to
include
plane
manufacturer
airbus
peugeot
maker
psa
group
and
its
fellow
french
automaker
renault
france
is
seeking
an
understanding
with
the
to
safeguard
its
carmakers
significant
iran
investments
a
government
official
said
psa
which
sold
vehicles
in
iran
last
year
called
on
the
european
union
to
maintain
a
united
front
in
defence
of
the
nuclear
agreement
germany
s
bdi
industry
association
also
said
the
eu
russia
and
china
should
commit
clearly
to
the
deal
after
washington
s
new
ambassador
ruffled
feathers
by
tweeting
german
companies
doing
business
in
iran
should
wind
down
operations
the
nuclear
detente
had
sparked
great
hopes
for
the
opening
of
the
iranian
market
bdi
head
dieter
kempf
said
these
hopes
have
now
clearly
been
government
and
company
officials
said
business
with
iran
had
slowed
recently
in
anticipation
of
washington
s
likely
withdrawal
from
the
deal
france
germany
and
italy
have
introduced
export
guarantees
designed
to
avoid
dollar
exposure
and
withstand
sanctions
while
the
eu
may
resort
to
statutes
ordering
companies
not
to
comply
in
updated
advice
to
businesses
however
the
british
government
said
how
uk
companies
act
in
response
to
sanctions
is
a
commercial
and
legal
decision
for
that
the
renewed
sanctions
may
have
implications
for
uk
businesses
and
individuals
dealing
with
iran
it
added
british
exports
to
iran
rose
nearly
percent
in
to
million
pounds
dwarfed
by
the
billion
euros
billion
pounds
of
german
exports
recorded
last
year
up
percent
volkswagen
which
resumed
exports
to
iran
in
said
it
was
monitoring
the
situation
closely
some
european
banks
that
had
resumed
financing
iranian
entities
after
the
nuclear
deal
said
they
had
already
stopped
doing
so
in
anticipation
of
trump
s
move
during
recent
months
the
operational
and
reputational
risks
associated
with
doing
business
in
iran
have
increased
danske
bank
s
spokesman
kenni
leth
said
earlier
this
year
we
decided
to
phase
out
and
exit
all
activities
to
and
from
iran
and
suspend
our
existing
relations
with
austria
s
oberbank
decided
last
november
not
to
provide
financing
to
iranian
counterparts
due
to
the
constantly
changing
political
framework
a
spokesman
said
germany
s
hermes
export
guarantee
scheme
for
iran
remains
in
place
for
the
time
being
the
country
s
economy
ministry
said
but
france
s
export
finance
programme
which
had
been
due
to
launch
in
has
been
put
on
hold
in
recent
weeks
pending
trump
s
decision
several
french
officials
told
reuters
export
finance
is
still
being
discussed
an
elysee
official
said
but
it
s
not
necessarily
that
simple
the
bpifrance
sovereign
fund
which
was
due
to
administer
the
scheme
declined
to
comment
french
officials
will
be
focused
on
helping
companies
exit
iran
within
the
periods
said
one
or
on
seeking
unlikely
waivers
or
assurances
for
activities
they
want
to
pursue
beyond
the
deadlines
companies
will
have
to
choose
between
their
iranian
economic
interests
and
their
potential
interests
said
a
senior
diplomat
generally
that
decision
is
quickly
made
in
favour
of
the
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
risk
calculation
the
trump
administration
appears
to
be
banking
on
companies
should
not
do
business
in
iran
a
state
department
official
said
in
a
phone
briefing
for
reporters
on
wednesday
when
asked
whether
foreign
business
interests
could
be
damaged
as
an
unintended
consequence
of
sanctions
that
s
an
intended
consequence
and
we
thank
our
ambassador
out
there
for
reaffirming
that
