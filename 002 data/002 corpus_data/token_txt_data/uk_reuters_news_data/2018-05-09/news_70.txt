beirut
may
reuters
iran
s
supreme
leader
called
president
donald
trump
s
comments
on
withdrawing
from
the
nuclear
agreement
silly
and
superficial
said
he
did
not
trust
the
european
countries
that
were
sticking
with
the
agreement
and
cast
doubt
on
the
future
of
the
deal
the
comments
came
on
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
s
official
website
on
wednesday
where
khamenei
reiterated
his
distaste
for
the
agreement
i
said
many
times
from
the
first
day
don
t
trust
america
khamenei
said
and
he
added
i
don
t
trust
these
three
countries
britain
france
and
germany
all
three
are
parties
to
the
agreement
and
were
trying
after
trump
s
withdrawal
to
salvage
the
deal
but
khamenei
sounded
dubious
about
their
efforts
if
you
can
t
get
a
definite
guarantee
then
the
nuclear
deal
can
not
be
continued
he
said
khamenei
heaped
scorn
on
trump
saying
you
heard
last
night
that
the
president
of
america
made
some
silly
and
superficial
comments
he
had
maybe
more
than
lies
in
his
comments
he
threatened
the
regime
and
the
people
saying
i
ll
do
this
and
that
trump
i
tell
you
on
behalf
of
the
iranian
people
you
ve
made
a
mistake
this
man
will
turn
to
dust
and
his
body
will
become
food
for
snakes
and
ants
he
added
and
the
islamic
republic
will
still
be
khamenei
the
highest
authority
in
iran
reluctantly
gave
his
backing
for
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
has
publicly
criticized
the
multiple
times
for
not
following
through
on
its
promises
under
the
agreement
raising
the
issue
of
iran
s
nuclear
programme
was
an
excuse
to
curb
the
islamic
republic
s
regional
influence
and
missile
programme
khamenei
said
accepting
negotiations
on
its
missiles
and
regional
influence
would
mean
iran
had
to
make
endless
concessions
he
said
we
accepted
the
nuclear
deal
but
the
enmity
against
the
islamic
republic
did
not
end
khamenei
said
iran
needs
to
preserve
its
nuclear
programme
because
the
country
will
need
megawatts
of
electricity
in
the
next
few
years
