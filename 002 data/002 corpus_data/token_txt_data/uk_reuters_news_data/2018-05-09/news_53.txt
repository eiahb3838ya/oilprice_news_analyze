after facebook, sweden set for more data centre deals -vattenfall
oslo
reuters
sweden
s
low
electricity
prices
are
likely
to
attract
new
data
centers
to
the
country
this
year
according
to
swedish
utility
vattenfall
which
said
it
is
discussing
deals
with
silicon
valley
companies
and
chinese
firms
the
nordic
countries
which
can
generate
electricity
relatively
cheaply
from
renewable
sources
such
as
hydropower
and
wind
have
long
been
a
magnet
for
heavy
power
industries
but
are
now
attracting
data
centers
sweden
which
also
has
nuclear
reactors
tends
to
have
the
cheapest
electricity
prices
during
most
of
the
year
vattenfall
already
supplies
power
to
a
number
of
data
centers
in
sweden
including
facebook
s
facility
in
the
city
of
lulea
which
facebook
decided
on
monday
to
double
in
size
we
are
actively
discussing
bringing
more
data
centers
to
sweden
with
big
companies
we
also
had
our
first
discussions
with
chinese
firms
that
showed
interest
vattenfall
s
head
of
strategy
andreas
regnell
told
reuters
based
on
these
discussions
i
expect
this
year
that
more
data
centers
will
come
to
sweden
though
not
of
the
facebook
magnitude
but
centers
will
come
as
well
by
said
regnell
sweden
plans
to
decommission
two
of
its
remaining
eight
nuclear
reactors
by
but
big
wind
projects
that
will
enter
the
nordic
power
system
will
make
up
for
lost
ground
and
keep
prices
competitive
regnell
added
in
sweden
cut
its
tax
rate
on
electricity
for
data
centers
by
percent
with
norway
following
suit
to
compete
with
its
neighbor
vattenfall
said
it
would
seek
to
win
supply
contracts
itself
but
added
regardless
who
won
the
deals
new
centers
would
be
good
news
for
utilities
in
sweden
where
margins
are
tight
we
will
be
happy
even
if
it
is
not
us
that
will
sign
the
electricity
supply
contract
total
consumption
grows
and
that
means
prices
will
go
up
which
will
create
profit
for
us
anyway
he
said
vattenfall
believes
other
industries
can
benefit
from
sweden
s
competitive
prices
such
as
carbon
fiber
makers
but
data
centers
are
its
prime
target
data
centers
are
the
number
one
two
and
three
targets
for
sweden
at
the
moment
after
these
comes
everything
else
