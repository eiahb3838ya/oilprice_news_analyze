adds
conoco
response
caracas
may
reuters
a
legal
dispute
between
conocophillips
and
venezuelan
state
oil
firm
pdvsa
could
leave
curacao
s
economically
important
isla
refinery
without
crude
oil
to
process
posing
a
potential
crisis
for
the
caribbean
island
curacao
s
prime
minister
said
on
tuesday
conoco
has
won
court
orders
allowing
it
to
seize
pdvsa
assets
on
caribbean
islands
including
curacao
in
efforts
to
collect
on
a
billion
arbitral
award
linked
to
the
nationalization
of
conoco
assets
the
operations
of
the
isla
refinery
which
provides
as
much
as
percent
of
curacao
s
gross
domestic
product
could
be
left
without
crude
supplies
if
pdvsa
halts
all
oil
shipments
to
prevent
them
from
being
seized
prime
minister
eugene
rhuggenaath
said
in
a
telephone
interview
we
are
aware
of
the
potential
risks
for
the
operation
of
the
refinery
rhuggenaath
said
a
stoppage
of
the
operation
would
have
a
devastating
impact
economically
and
pdvsa
has
already
suspended
oil
storage
and
shipping
from
its
caribbean
facilities
according
to
a
pdvsa
source
and
reuters
data
curacao
a
small
island
off
the
coast
of
venezuela
is
prepared
to
purchase
refined
products
on
the
global
market
to
ensure
it
can
maintain
supplies
for
the
local
population
as
well
as
for
shipping
this
is
indeed
a
potential
crisis
that
can
very
profoundly
affect
the
social
and
economic
situation
of
our
island
and
therefore
we
are
always
willing
to
discuss
and
reach
out
to
relevant
parties
rhuggenaath
said
he
said
conoco
has
yet
to
seize
any
assets
curacao
is
still
scrutinizing
a
lien
a
legal
instrument
that
paves
the
way
for
an
asset
seizure
because
the
government
s
legal
counsel
does
not
fully
understand
it
he
said
conoco
is
also
seeking
to
seize
assets
on
the
nearby
island
of
bonaire
where
pdvsa
owns
a
storage
terminal
in
contrast
isla
is
owned
by
curacao
firms
and
is
leased
to
pdvsa
this
is
a
different
situation
than
in
bonaire
said
the
prime
minister
neither
pdvsa
nor
conoco
has
contacted
curacao
authorities
regarding
how
the
legal
dispute
could
affect
the
island
according
to
rhuggenaath
conocophillips
said
it
has
sought
to
resolve
issues
caused
by
its
efforts
to
collect
the
arbitration
award
we
have
been
in
touch
with
the
local
officials
and
are
working
to
address
their
concerns
spokesman
daren
beaudo
said
as
we
said
previously
we
will
work
with
the
community
and
local
authorities
to
address
issues
that
may
arise
as
a
result
of
enforcement
pdvsa
did
not
immediately
respond
to
an
email
seeking
comment
curacao
is
a
constituent
country
within
the
kingdom
of
the
netherlands
with
a
vibrant
tourism
industry
and
ports
used
by
the
oil
industry
during
the
oil
boom
years
venezuelans
flooded
the
island
to
shop
and
vacation
but
the
opec
nation
s
calamitous
economic
decline
in
recent
years
has
turned
curacao
and
neighboring
islands
into
havens
for
migrants
seeking
escape
from
hunger
and
disease
