syrah
resources
is
targeting
the
market
for
electric
vehicle
batteries
with
its
balama
graphite
mine
in
mozambique
which
started
production
in
november
a
global
scramble
is
on
for
commodities
such
as
graphite
cobalt
and
lithium
which
are
among
the
key
components
in
the
rechargeable
batteries
used
to
power
mobile
devices
and
electric
vehicles
the
growth
market
and
our
focus
in
the
coming
years
is
very
much
in
the
battery
segment
syrah
chief
executive
shaun
verner
told
reuters
in
a
telephone
interview
verner
said
syrah
saw
the
market
for
graphite
more
than
doubling
over
the
next
eight
years
to
million
tonnes
from
tonnes
currently
with
the
battery
industry
accounting
for
the
bulk
of
that
demand
currently
battery
demand
is
about
tonnes
or
around
percent
of
the
market
about
percent
of
our
production
is
the
smaller
flake
in
demand
in
the
battery
sector
verner
said
capacity
for
the
balama
mine
and
plant
is
tonnes
annually
and
the
company
is
looking
at
to
tonnes
in
the
first
year
reaching
full
production
in
three
years
and
cutting
into
the
dominance
of
china
where
percent
of
global
supply
currently
originates
by
it
will
be
providing
to
percent
of
global
supply
if
current
projections
remain
on
target
in
our
first
four
months
of
operation
we
have
exported
to
countries
across
asia
verner
said
with
most
going
to
china
japan
and
south
korea
in
europe
germany
has
been
the
biggest
consumer
the
resource
is
close
to
the
surface
and
easy
to
access
the
graphite
is
exported
through
the
port
of
nacala
taken
there
by
road
on
a
km
mile
journey
from
the
mine
in
the
interior
of
northern
mozambique
south
africa
s
grinrod
has
a
logistics
contract
to
provide
road
transport
and
warehousing
infrastructure
challenges
in
the
southern
african
country
which
is
extremely
poor
and
underdeveloped
have
stymied
the
growth
of
its
coal
sector
mozambique
also
has
huge
offshore
gas
reserves
that
are
being
brought
to
commercial
production
parts
of
mozambique
s
remote
north
and
central
regions
have
been
hit
in
recent
years
by
security
incidents
and
banditry
but
verner
said
the
project
had
not
been
impacted
we
have
not
seen
any
security
concerns
right
through
the
period
from
exploration
to
construction
and
now
into
operations
