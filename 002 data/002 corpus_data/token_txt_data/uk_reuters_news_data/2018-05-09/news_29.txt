germany's uniper makes head start in converting wind power to gas
frankfurt
reuters
german
utility
uniper
launched
a
pilot
scheme
at
its
falkenhagen
site
on
wednesday
to
produce
methane
gas
from
wind
power
as
the
country
seeks
wider
uses
for
renewable
energy
the
falkenhagen
plant
set
up
five
years
ago
in
germany
s
brandenburg
state
already
produces
green
hydrogen
by
running
wind
power
through
water
to
split
it
into
oxygen
and
hydrogen
methane
gas
would
provide
a
higher
quality
material
with
more
diversified
uses
this
is
an
important
step
for
a
successful
energy
transition
uniper
said
in
a
statement
after
the
company
opened
a
new
facility
at
the
site
for
the
scheme
green
methane
in
contrast
to
green
hydrogen
can
be
used
in
a
wider
variety
of
germany
is
looking
at
new
ways
to
use
and
store
renewable
energy
at
a
number
of
sites
as
a
boom
in
wind
and
solar
power
in
the
country
has
led
to
excess
production
billions
of
euros
have
also
been
spent
building
up
a
natural
gas
infrastructure
which
the
government
wants
to
use
to
store
energy
rather
than
retiring
it
once
renewables
largely
replace
coal
nuclear
power
and
gas
by
the
middle
of
the
century
under
the
government
s
energy
policy
while
green
hydrogen
can
be
used
as
a
transport
fuel
or
fed
into
gas
grids
which
can
technically
absorb
percent
hydrogen
as
a
complementary
fuel
to
natural
gas
green
methane
would
take
renewable
energy
a
step
further
it
can
be
made
available
to
a
variety
of
markets
such
as
the
manufacturing
sector
the
electricity
and
heating
markets
as
well
as
the
mobility
sector
uniper
said
under
the
pilot
scheme
the
company
will
set
out
to
produce
green
methane
by
using
carbon
dioxide
from
a
plant
and
mixing
it
with
the
hydrogen
creating
a
substance
if
uniper
engineers
can
show
the
technology
is
viable
they
hope
that
germany
can
lead
the
way
in
providing
the
renewables
sector
with
an
entirely
new
raw
material
but
it
is
early
days
uniper
says
the
methanation
plant
s
initial
hourly
production
of
gas
will
be
equivalent
only
to
the
heat
consumed
by
a
metre
square
foot
apartment
in
a
month
which
is
tiny
the
material
s
potential
for
industrial
use
longer
term
could
be
huge
however
and
there
is
wide
interest
in
the
facility
as
companies
including
uniper
vattenfall
basf
and
enbw
have
all
invested
individually
in
research
falkenhagen
is
part
of
a
european
energy
project
called
store
go
that
is
calling
for
regulatory
and
policy
support
given
efficiency
rates
are
still
well
below
marketability
