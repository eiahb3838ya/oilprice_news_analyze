aranguren
said
as
the
country
s
unconventional
gas
production
increases
argentina
is
also
in
talks
with
its
neighbors
chile
and
bolivia
to
solve
its
seasonal
gas
deficit
by
increasing
winter
imports
from
bolivia
while
selling
its
surplus
to
chile
in
the
summer
this
is
quite
a
constraint
i
m
prepared
to
pay
more
to
bolivia
during
the
summer
if
we
can
adjust
the
volumes
the
minister
said
argentina
under
president
mauricio
macri
has
been
pushing
to
reverse
the
nation
s
oil
and
gas
production
decline
while
the
retail
fuel
market
but
as
global
oil
prices
continue
rising
refiners
in
the
country
are
struggling
to
avoid
transferring
the
hike
to
consumers
the
minister
said
he
will
call
oil
producers
to
participate
in
a
program
recently
agreed
with
refiners
royal
dutch
shell
pan
american
and
ypf
to
defer
fuel
price
increases
planned
for
may
and
june
to
the
second
half
the
year
i
think
they
could
try
to
make
sale
terms
easier
for
refining
