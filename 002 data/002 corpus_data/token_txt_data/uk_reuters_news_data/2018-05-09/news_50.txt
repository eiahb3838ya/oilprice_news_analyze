nigeria
s
parliament
aims
to
pass
a
bill
to
overhaul
the
oil
sector
by
the
end
of
july
senate
president
bukola
saraki
told
reuters
the
petroleum
industry
bill
pib
which
aims
to
improve
transparency
attract
investors
and
stimulate
growth
has
been
debated
for
more
than
a
decade
and
was
broken
into
sections
to
help
it
pass
into
law
the
pib
was
discussed
for
some
years
before
the
governance
bill
was
passed
by
both
houses
of
parliament
in
january
that
unprecedented
move
following
the
decision
to
break
up
the
unwieldy
pib
into
smaller
bills
raised
hopes
that
the
other
pieces
of
legislation
could
be
passed
soon
after
nigeria
is
an
opec
member
and
africa
s
largest
oil
producer
crude
sales
make
up
of
government
revenue
but
the
sector
s
development
has
been
held
back
for
decades
by
mismanagement
saraki
said
in
an
interview
the
aim
was
to
ensure
all
three
remaining
parts
of
the
legislation
were
passed
by
the
national
assembly
before
it
went
on
holiday
in
july
we
go
on
the
summer
break
in
july
if
we
don
t
pass
it
by
july
by
the
time
we
come
back
in
september
it
is
all
going
to
be
elections
said
saraki
referring
to
presidential
and
legislative
polls
scheduled
to
take
place
early
next
year
he
said
the
break
would
begin
in
the
third
week
of
july
any
bills
passed
by
lawmakers
would
have
to
be
signed
into
law
by
president
muhammadu
buhari
the
governance
bill
passed
in
january
is
awaiting
buhari
s
approval
the
other
three
parts
the
fiscal
administrative
and
host
community
bills
are
yet
to
be
passed
saraki
said
the
bills
would
be
discussed
at
a
public
hearing
between
the
first
and
third
weeks
of
may
before
being
returned
to
lawmakers
we
are
working
on
all
three
at
the
same
time
the
three
should
go
at
the
same
time
said
saraki
on
tuesday
when
asked
about
the
order
in
which
the
bills
would
be
passed
antony
goldman
of
pm
consulting
said
huge
logistical
and
policy
challenges
would
have
to
be
resolved
for
the
legislation
to
be
passed
by
the
end
of
july
if
they
could
get
it
done
it
would
be
a
very
significant
achievement
said
goldman
if
they
fail
risk
increases
that
the
whole
process
might
stall
until
well
after
the
next
growth
remains
weak
in
nigeria
s
economy
as
it
continues
to
emerge
from
its
recession
the
country
s
first
contraction
in
years
the
recession
was
largely
caused
by
low
crude
prices
and
militant
attacks
on
energy
facilities
with
economic
growth
still
slow
there
have
been
calls
for
parliament
to
complete
its
work
on
the
record
trillion
naira
billion
budget
that
was
presented
to
the
legislature
by
buhari
in
november
any
changes
made
by
lawmakers
must
be
sent
back
to
buhari
for
approval
the
central
bank
governor
last
month
urged
the
swift
passage
of
the
budget
to
bolster
the
economy
since
it
would
enable
the
government
to
implement
its
spending
plan
it
should
be
laid
probably
end
of
this
week
latest
tuesday
and
hopefully
passed
on
wednesday
saraki
said
of
the
budget
during
the
interview
in
the
national
assembly
in
the
capital
abuja
he
said
the
delay
in
passing
the
spending
plan
was
largely
due
to
a
number
of
ministries
and
government
agencies
providing
incomplete
information
delays
in
passing
budgets
amid
wrangling
between
the
executive
and
legislature
are
common
in
nigeria
and
hindered
the
implementation
of
buhari
s
previous
spending
plans
