saudi
arabia
is
in
pole
position
to
be
the
major
beneficiary
of
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
walk
away
from
the
iranian
nuclear
deal
and
reimpose
sanctions
on
the
islamic
republic
it
s
little
surprise
that
one
of
the
few
voices
of
support
for
trump
s
move
was
from
saudi
arabia
the
main
rival
to
iran
in
the
volatile
middle
east
the
saudis
stand
to
enjoy
a
windfall
as
crude
oil
prices
may
remain
strong
and
state
producer
saudi
aramco
will
also
likely
to
be
able
to
pump
more
oil
to
replace
any
iranian
barrels
lost
because
of
the
reimposed
sanctions
a
cherry
on
top
of
this
is
that
customers
who
had
been
turning
away
from
saudi
crude
such
as
the
world
s
top
importer
china
may
be
forced
to
buy
more
from
the
kingdom
this
would
allow
the
saudis
to
regain
market
share
lost
since
the
deal
between
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
allies
such
as
russia
to
reduce
output
in
order
to
tighten
global
oil
markets
the
main
risk
for
the
saudis
is
that
the
decision
inflames
an
already
tense
situation
in
the
middle
east
resulting
in
increased
conflict
and
even
the
possibility
of
outright
war
however
the
saudis
are
probably
taking
a
calculated
risk
that
the
conflict
situations
won
t
worsen
much
and
in
the
meantime
they
stand
to
gain
a
financial
windfall
and
weaken
their
key
rival
at
the
same
time
whether
the
eventual
reality
aligns
with
what
the
saudis
hope
for
is
inherently
uncertain
but
there
are
some
points
worth
noting
firstly
despite
the
usual
flourish
of
belligerence
and
flamboyance
in
trump
s
announcement
not
much
is
likely
to
happen
for
several
months
this
is
because
the
treasury
department
has
indicated
that
sanctions
won
t
be
reimposed
immediately
rather
that
it
will
take
up
to
days
to
allow
iranian
oil
customers
and
other
companies
involved
in
doing
business
with
tehran
to
make
plans
it
s
also
not
clear
what
sanctions
will
be
reimposed
and
in
what
form
with
the
main
risk
being
the
secondary
sanctions
that
would
target
companies
that
do
business
with
other
entities
involved
with
iran
this
means
for
the
moment
it
is
pure
speculation
as
to
how
much
iranian
oil
may
be
lost
to
the
market
most
analyst
estimates
seem
to
vary
from
around
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
being
at
risk
which
would
be
enough
to
add
to
an
already
existing
tightness
in
global
crude
markets
but
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
even
the
upper
end
of
this
range
could
be
replaced
relatively
easily
by
the
rest
of
opec
and
its
allies
party
to
the
agreement
to
restrict
production
in
addition
crude
exports
from
the
united
states
also
have
the
capacity
to
increase
especially
if
oil
prices
remain
high
thereby
incentivising
shale
producers
to
drill
more
wells
in
short
the
global
oil
supply
chain
can
handle
the
loss
of
bpd
of
iranian
crude
although
doing
so
may
come
at
the
cost
of
higher
prices
it
also
remains
uncertain
as
to
how
buyers
of
iranian
crude
will
respond
to
the
decision
virtually
all
of
them
from
europe
to
asia
vehemently
disagree
with
trump
s
move
china
s
imports
from
iran
were
bpd
in
the
first
quarter
up
percent
from
the
same
period
in
and
enough
to
make
iran
the
supplier
although
the
gap
to
number
five
brazil
is
miniscule
china
imported
million
bpd
from
saudi
arabia
in
the
first
quarter
down
percent
making
the
kingdom
the
second
biggest
supplier
behind
russia
india
asia
s
crude
importer
brought
in
bpd
of
iranian
crude
in
the
first
quarter
down
percent
from
the
same
period
last
year
the
south
asian
nation
s
imports
from
saudi
arabia
were
up
percent
to
about
bpd
but
the
big
mover
was
imports
from
iraq
up
a
massive
percent
to
million
bpd
while
both
india
and
china
have
scope
to
lower
their
imports
from
iran
they
will
likely
be
reluctant
especially
given
the
ongoing
dispute
over
pricing
between
china
s
top
refiner
sinopec
and
saudi
arabia
the
most
likely
outcome
is
that
asian
crude
buyers
will
do
only
the
barest
minimum
to
give
the
appearance
of
complying
with
whatever
measures
the
trump
administration
takes
or
even
openly
defy
them
the
least
likely
outcome
is
that
asian
countries
cooperate
fully
with
the
united
states
in
its
renewed
conflict
with
iran
while
the
next
months
are
likely
to
be
characterised
by
uncertainty
it
s
likely
the
united
states
is
going
to
find
it
considerably
harder
to
make
the
rest
of
the
world
bend
to
its
will
this
time
especially
when
the
major
financial
beneficiaries
are
its
own
oil
producers
and
the
saudi
arabians
