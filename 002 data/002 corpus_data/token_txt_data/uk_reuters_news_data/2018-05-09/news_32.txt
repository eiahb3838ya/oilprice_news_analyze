bats have hung around for 33 million years, fossil shows
brussels
reuters
belgian
scientists
have
discovered
the
oldest
ever
fossil
of
the
common
bat
proving
the
species
already
existed
more
than
million
years
ago
the
bones
of
the
tiny
mammal
were
found
at
a
fossil
site
in
the
late
unearthed
when
a
new
train
track
was
built
east
of
brussels
but
researchers
spent
decades
sifting
through
tonnes
of
soil
to
make
the
discovery
eventually
they
encountered
the
bones
of
a
tiny
bat
from
the
myotis
or
bat
genus
barely
changed
from
those
commonly
found
in
europe
today
this
fossil
bat
is
tiny
it
is
only
made
up
of
tiny
isolated
teeth
fragments
of
the
jaw
and
some
small
bones
said
thierry
smith
one
of
the
researchers
involved
in
the
project
at
the
royal
institute
of
natural
sciences
some
species
survive
a
few
thousand
years
or
one
or
two
million
years
but
not
like
here
million
years
he
added
the
belgian
discovery
shows
that
the
previous
estimate
of
when
such
bats
appeared
for
the
first
time
was
off
by
some
seven
million
years
smith
said
the
long
life
of
the
bat
species
could
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
bats
are
the
only
mammal
capable
of
flying
and
as
such
did
not
need
to
compete
with
others
for
resources
