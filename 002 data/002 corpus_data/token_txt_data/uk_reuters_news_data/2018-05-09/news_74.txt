update 5-buyers seek u.s. waivers to buy iranian oil amid new sanctions
reuters
south
korea
said
on
wednesday
it
would
seek
exemptions
to
buy
iranian
oil
a
path
many
big
oil
consumers
are
likely
to
follow
in
the
wake
of
new
sanctions
on
tehran
which
will
tighten
world
oil
markets
and
push
up
prices
iran
is
the
oil
producer
in
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
a
key
supplier
especially
to
refiners
in
asia
the
united
states
plans
to
impose
new
unilateral
sanctions
after
abandoning
an
agreement
reached
in
late
which
limited
iran
s
nuclear
ambitions
in
exchange
for
removing
joint
sanctions
which
included
strict
curbs
on
crude
oil
exports
new
sanctions
will
include
measures
aimed
at
its
oil
and
shipping
sectors
with
a
wind
down
period
to
allow
companies
to
end
contracts
terminate
business
and
get
their
money
out
according
to
the
state
department
president
trump
is
clearly
articulating
that
he
has
minimal
desire
in
an
alternative
agreement
with
iran
said
ehsan
khoman
head
of
research
for
middle
east
and
north
africa
at
mitsubishi
ufj
financial
group
during
the
last
round
of
sanctions
iran
s
oil
supplies
fell
by
around
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
but
the
country
as
a
major
oil
exporter
after
sanctions
were
lifted
in
january
since
then
iran
ramped
up
supplies
producing
million
bpd
in
march
almost
percent
of
global
output
its
crude
exports
averaged
over
million
bpd
in
quarter
this
year
analysts
now
expect
iran
s
supplies
to
fall
by
between
bpd
and
million
bpd
depending
on
how
many
other
countries
fall
in
line
with

it

khoman
said
trade
data
already
show
a
reduction
of
iranian
oil
supplies
to
japan
and
south
korea
and
refinery
sources
confirmed
they
had
started
shifting
purchases
in
preparation
for
renewed
sanctions
iranian
crude
oil
shipments
to
japan
and
south
korea
have
fallen
by
half
from
their
peak
in
march
hitting
just
over
bpd
in

according

the
biggest
single
buyer
of
iran
s
crude
is
china
which
imported
about
bpd
in
but
has
scaled
back
shipments
to
around
bpd
in
a
senior
official
with
a
chinese
oil
major
who
declined
to
be
identified
because
he
is
not
authorised
to

to

said
new
sanctions
would
hurt
chinese
refiners
by
pushing
up
the
price

brent

hit
its
highest
since
november
on
wednesday
at

a

china
s
response
to
the
sanctions
is
unclear
beijing
has
opposed
the
move
and
many
chinese
companies
may
continue
to
buy
iranian
crude
analysts
say
and
chinese
refiners
say
there
are
alternative
suppliers
including
russia
saudi
arabia
and
exporters
in
west
africa
in
india
another
major
buyer
of
iranian
oil
refiners
hope
they
can
continue
importing
iranian
oil
during
the
last
round
of
sanctions
india
enjoyed
waivers
allowing
limited
iranian
oil
imports
paid
for
in
rupees
instead
of
dollars
the
impact
of
new
sanctions
in
india
will
be
there
but
not
so
high
said
r
ramachandran
head
of
refineries
at
oil
firm
bharat
petroleum
corp
when
sanctions
were
loosened
against
tehran
in
india
ramped
up

almost
bpd
in

intake
has
fallen
back
to
around

the
threat
of
new

comes
as
demand
in

the
world
s
biggest
region
hit
a
record
and
producers
including
saudi
arabia
and
russia
restrict
supply
to
prop
up
prices
as
a
result
crude

inventories
in
major

have
fallen
sharply
in
the

a
half
to
billion

only
slightly
above

trying
to
ease

concerns
saudi
arabia
said
on

that
it

work
with
