paper
said
without

we

industrial
strategy
beis
said
in
an
emailed

nuclear
power
remains
a
crucial
part

energy

but
we
have
always
been
clear
that
this
must
be
delivered
at
the
right
price
for
consumers
and
taxpayers
he
said
britain
is
seeking
new
ways
to
fund
nuclear
projects
after
criticism
over
a
deal
awarded
to
france
s
edf
to
build
the
first
nuclear
plant
in
britain
for
years
which
could
cost

these

are
commercially
sensitive

no

horizon
plans

the

said
the
two

could
generate
enough
electricity
to
power
million
homes

create
tens
of
thousands
of
jobs
there
are
regular
and
ongoing
discussions
between
ourselves
and
the
uk
government
on
the
project
but
we
will
not
comment
on
the
specifics
in
terms
of
the
participants
in
or
content
of
the
conversations
a
spokesman
for
horizon
said
the
mainichi
report
said
hitachi
is
still
pushing
for
the
british
government
to
take
a
stake
in
the
project
and
guarantee
electricity
prices
to
ensure
it
is
profitable
the
cost
of
the
hitachi
project
in
wales
has
ballooned
to
trillion
yen
billion
pounds
due

measures
