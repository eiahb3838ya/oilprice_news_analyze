urban
areas
by
according
to
the
united

the

presents
an
environmental
challenge

lines
to
programs
said
jonathan

technology
which
created
the

as
you

the

aims
to
encourage
users
in

canadian
cities
to
use
cleaner
modes
of
transportation
from
mass

to
walking

accounts
for
less

sperling
the

s
suggested
route
is
a
cowline
city

whitworth
in
pastoral
settings
a

is
the
most
direct
path
cattle
use
to
reach
grazing
grounds
the
app
shows
users
after
a
trip
how
many
kilograms
of
equivalent
emissions
they
are
responsible
for
whitworth

such

users
carbon
footprints
cowlines
claims
its

for
standardization
is
most
accurate
