saudi
arabia
raised
oil
production
to
an
high
in
november
an
industry
source
said
on
monday
as
president
donald
trump
piled
pressure
on
the
kingdom
to
refrain
from
production
cuts
at
an
opec
meeting
next
week
the
meeting
at
which
opec
members
will
consider
how
to
arrest
a
decline
in
oil
prices
comes
days
after
leaders
of
top
global
oil
producers
russian
president
vladimir
putin
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
and
trump
travel
to
argentina
for
a
summit
this
week
saudi
arabia
agreed
to
raise
supply
steeply
in
june
in
response
to
calls
from
consumers
including
the
united
states
and
india
to
help
cool
oil
prices
and
address
a
supply
shortage
after
washington
imposed
sanctions
on
iran
but
the
move
backfired
on
riyadh
after
washington
imposed
softer
than
expected
sanctions
on
tehran
that
triggered
worries
of
a
supply
glut
and
prices
collapsed
to
below
per
barrel
on
friday
from
as
high
as
per
barrel
in
october
the
industry
source
who
is
familiar
with
the
matter
said
saudi
crude
oil
production
hit
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
november
although
it
will
not
be
clear
what
the
exact
average
november
output
is
until
the
month
is
over
those
levels
are
up
around
million
bpd
equal
to
percent
of
global
demand
from
october
and
more
than
million
bpd
higher
than
in
early
when
riyadh
was
curtailing
production
together
with
other
opec
members
russia
which
teamed
up
with
saudi
arabia
in
the
first
opec
joint
production
cuts
since
has
also
raised
production
steeply
in
recent
months
to
a
high
of
million
bpd
analysts
at
goldman
sachs
one
of
the
most
active
banks
in
commodities
said
the
meeting
could
be
a
catalyst
for
prices
to
rebound
we
expect
an
opec
cut
and
its
announcement
to
lead
to
a
recovery
in
brent
prices
the
bank
said
in
a
note
saudi
oil
industry
sources
have
signaled
they
wanted
prices
to
stay
above
per
barrel
and
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
al
falih
said
this
month
global
oil
supply
could
exceed
demand
by
over
million
bpd
next
year
requiring
opec
to
take
action
falih
said
earlier
this
month
that
state
oil
giant
saudi
aramco
would
ship
million
bpd
less
crude
in
december
than
in
november
as
demand
from
customers
was
lower
possibly
complicating
saudi
decisions
on
oil
output
is
the
crisis
around
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
riyadh
s
consulate
in
istanbul
last
month
trump
stood
behind
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
despite
calls
from
many
politicians
to
impose
stiff
sanctions
on
riyadh
prince
mohammed
is
the
ultimate
saudi
oil
policy
maker
and
saudi
watchers
have
said
the
prince
will
try
to
avoid
confrontation
with
washington
including
on
oil
prices
the
united
states
is
not
a
member
of
opec
and
is
not
participating
in
the
output
reduction
trump
has
repeatedly
called
on
opec
to
refrain
from
cuts
and
has
raised
pressure
on
the
group
in
the
last
few
days
on
sunday
trump
thanked
himself
for
lower
oil
prices
and
compared
it
to
a
big
tax
cut
for
the
economy
so
great
that
oil
prices
are
falling

you
president
t
trump
