europe
s
markets
rallied
on
monday
on
signs
that
italy
was
preparing
to
rework
the
spending
plans
that
have
fuelled
tensions
with
the
european
union
while
wall
street
futures
were
looking
for
friday
a
bounce
in
oil
after
its
own
black
friday
the
survival
chances
of
britain
s
newly
sealed
brexit
agreement
and
renewed
russia
and
ukraine
tensions
had
all
kept
europe
s
traders
busy
but
it
was
italy
that
stole
the
show
deputy
prime
minister
matteo
salvini
had
hinted
over
the
weekend
at
the
possibility
of
tweaking
the
country
s
budget
deficit
goal
saying
no
one
is
stuck
to
the
percent
target
and
there
was
talk
on
monday
of
closer
to
percent
italy
s
banks
index
duly
leapt
percent
towards
its
strongest
day
since
june
and
an
equally
strong
rally
in
bond
markets
sent
italian
borrowing
costs
to
their
lowest
since
september
it
will
help
the
banks
if
the
spread
goes
lower
which
it
has
been
this
morning
pierre
bose
head
of
european
strategy
at
credit
suisse
wealth
management
said
you
potentially
move
from
a
negative
spiral
to
a
more
positive
spiral
where
you
end
up
with
less
pressure
on
the
banks
more
ability
to
lend
and
that
will
underpin
growth
in
a
better
the
euro
also
climbed
rising
percent
to
and
as
much
as
percent
at
yen
though
it
lost
a
bit
of
traction
after
germany
s
monthly
ifo
survey
showed
a
drop
in
business
morale
the
ifo
index
s
fall
is
somewhat
alarming
uwe
burkert
of
lbbw
wrote
in
a
note
it
was
generally
expected
that
the
economic
weakness
of
the
third
quarter
would
be
corrected
with
a
firmly
positive
growth
figure
in
the
fourth
there
was
also
a
percent
rise
for
the
pound
against
the
dollar
after
britain
and
european
union
reached
an
agreement
over
brexit
plans
on
sunday
it
was
flat
against
the
euro
though
and
analysts
remain
cautious
that
the
brexit
deal
faces
stiff
opposition
within
the
british
parliament
which
will
is
expected
to
vote
on
the
agreement
in
around
two
weeks
time
the
failure
of
the
pound
to
rally
on
recent
positive
developments
suggest
the
market
is
pricing
in
that
the
deal
won
t
pass
the
first
time
in
parliament
said
lee
hardman
a
currency
analyst
at
mufg
during
the
next
two
weeks
the
pound
will
likely
trade
with
increased
volatility

both

brent

down
more

and
unless
they
recover
further
this

the

russian

saw
