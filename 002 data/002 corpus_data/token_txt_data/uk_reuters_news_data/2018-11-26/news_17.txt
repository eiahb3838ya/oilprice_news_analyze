update 5-faroe petroleum scorns $781 mln dno bid as 'inadequate'
london
reuters
britain
s
faroe
petroleum
rejected
a
million
pound
hostile
bid
by
dno
on
monday
which
it
said
substantially
undervalued
the
firm
norway
s
dno
which
already
owns
percent
of
faroe
returned
to
the
north
sea
last
year
after
years
of
expansion
in
the
middle
east
focusing
on
iraqi
kurdistan
with
the
aim
of
growing
via
acquisitions
and
other
investments
we
urge
shareholders
to
reject
dno
s
opportunistic
unsolicited
and
inadequate
offer
faroe
s
chairman
john
bentley
said
faroe
shares
closed
nearly
percent
higher
at
pence
above
the
pence
cash
offer
price
while
shares
in
dno
rose
by
more
than
percent
after
it
made
the
bid
public
on
monday
paul
mumford
at
cavendish
asset
management
which
holds
between
and
percent
of
faroe
said
dno
would
need
to
offer
around
pounds
per
share
for
its
bid
to
succeed
given
the
falling
oil
prices
dno
clearly
thought
it
could
swoop
in
and
secure
itself
a
bargain
mumford
said
faroe
which
said
dno
had
not
engaged
with
it
before
making
its
offer
said
that
its
board
would
write
to
shareholders
and
urged
them
to
take
no
action
in
the
meantime
its
ceo
graham
stewart
told
reuters
in
september
that
faroe
wanted
to
stay
independent
dno
said
its
offer
represented
a
percent
premium
to
faroe
s
closing
price
on
april
a
day
before
it
triggered
bid
speculation
by
building
a
stake
in
the
period
between
our
first
acquisition
and
this
offer
the
price
of
brent
crude
has
dropped
percent
and
oil
and
equity
markets
have
entered
a
period
of
great
uncertainty
dno
executive
chairman
bijan
said
sparebank
markets
analyst
teodor
said
the
deal
would
give
faroe
shareholder
access
to
dno
s
strong
cashflow
but
added
he
expected
dno
would
need
to
increase
the
offer
price
by
to
percent
dno
said
it
had
made
the
offer
to
safeguard
its
investment
because
of
faroe
s
refusal
to
grant
it
a
seat
on
the
board
and
against
moves
to
dilute
shareholdings
in
august
dno
withdrew
its
request
for
seats
on
faroe
s
board
amid
an
escalating
war
of
words
over
the
british
company
s
wider
governance
culture
and
strategies
bmo
capital
markets
which
advises
faroe
said
in
a
note
that
it
valued
faroe
s
shares
much
higher
at
around
pence
and
at
around
pounds
on
a
fully
basis
