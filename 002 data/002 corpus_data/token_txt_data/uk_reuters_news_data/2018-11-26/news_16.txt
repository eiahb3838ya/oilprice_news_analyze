and
whether
the

compensate

well
as
regions

losses
a
commission
said
with
brown
coal

in
a
country
reliant

imports
germany
faces
wrangling
over
when
to
abandon
to
meet
ambitious
climate
goals
by
as
it
also
wants
to
be
free
of
nuclear
energy
by
the
german
cabinet
has
appointed
a
group
the
coal
commission
to
find
a
compromise
deal
it
was
expected
to
present
an
exit
plan
by
the
end
of
the
year
but
after
another
round
of
talks
in
berlin
on

the
heads

economy
minister
peter
altmaier
said
the
postponement
of
the
decision
could
increase
the
chances
for
a
broader
acceptance
of
the
coal
exit
plan
i
think
there
is
no
reason
to
be
disappointed
altmaier
said
adding
that
finance
minister
olaf
scholz
who
also
participated
in
the
talks
on
monday
was
trying
to
fend
off
calls
for
extra
spending
two
people
familiar
with
the
talks
told
reuters
that
scholz
has
shown
little
sympathy
for
paying
compensation
to
operators
of
power
plants
that
could
be
forced
to
shut
down
early
scholz
is
also
sceptical
of
other
measures
to
help
companies
cope
with
the
effects
of
the
planned
brown
coal
exit
such
as
lowering
energy
tax
two
people
familiar
with
the
talks
said
a
finance
ministry
spokeswoman
declined
to
comment
so
far
the
coalition
parties
have
agreed
to
spend
billion
euros
billion
pounds
to
help
regions
especially
affected
by
structural
change
such
as
the
planed
coal
exit
the
commission
will
help
allocate
federal
funds
for
bringing
new
industries
into
the
regions
such
as
battery
cell
research
and
production
production
both
from
brown
coal
and
imported
hard
coal
accounts
for
percent
of
germany
s
total
power
production
making
the
exit
from
coal
difficult
while
maintaining
reliable
supply
to
industries
and
households
