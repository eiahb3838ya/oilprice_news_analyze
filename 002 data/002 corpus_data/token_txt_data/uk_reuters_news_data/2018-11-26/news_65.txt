oil
prices
won
back
some
ground
after
hefty
losses
on
friday
but
remained
under
pressure
with
brent
crude
below
per
barrel
amid
weak
fundamentals
and
struggling
financial
markets
brent
crude
oil
futures
were
at
per
barrel
at
gmt
up
cents
or
percent
from
their
last
close
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
futures
were
up
cents
or
percent
at

but
monday
s
gains
did
little
to
make
up
for
the
almost
plunge
on
friday
which
traders
have
already
dubbed
black
friday
greg
mckenna
an
independent
financial
analyst
from
australia
said
there
had
been
an
utter
capitulation
in
crude
oil
markets
the
downward
pressure
comes
from
surging
supply
and
a
slowdown
in
which
is
expected
to
result
in
an
oil
supply
overhang
in
beyond
weak
fundamentals
oil
markets
are
also
being
impacted
by
a
downturn
in
wider
financial
markets
clearly
marked
the
end
of
the
asia
credit
bull
market
due
to
tightening
financial
conditions
in
asia
especially
china
and
we
expect
this
to
remain
the
case
in
morgan
stanley
said
in
a
note
released
on
sunday
we
don
t
think
that
we
are
at
the
bottom
of
the
cycle
yet
the
bank
said
oil
markets
have
also
been
weighed
down
by
the
strong
which
has
surged
against
most
other
currencies
this
year
thanks
to
rising
interest
rates
that
have
pulled
investor
money
out
of
other
currencies
and
also
assets
like
oil
which
are
seen
as
more
risky
than
the
greenback
anything
denominated
against
the
usd
is
under
pressure
right
now
said
mckenna
another
risk
to
global
trade
and
overall
economic
growth
is
the
trade
war
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
the
united
states
and
china
the
trade
conflict
poses
a
downside
risk
as
we
forecast
the
to
impose
percent
tariffs
on
all
china
imports
