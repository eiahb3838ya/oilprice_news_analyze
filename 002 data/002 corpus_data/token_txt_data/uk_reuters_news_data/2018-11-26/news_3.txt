washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
said
on
monday
the
agreement
allowing
the
united
kingdom
to
leave
the
european
union
may
make
trade
between
washington
and
london
more
difficult
but
the
uk
prime
minister
s
office
disputed
his
interpretation
trump
told
reporters
outside
the
white
house
that
the
deal
sounded
like
it
would
be
good
for
the
european
union
but
i
think
we
have
to
take
a
look
seriously
whether
or
not
the
uk
is
allowed
to
trade
because
right
now
if
you
look
at
the
deal
they
may
not
be
able
to
trade
with
us
he
said
and
that
wouldn
t
be
a
good
thing
i
don
t
think
they
meant
he
said
he
hoped
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
would
be
able
to
address
the
problem
but
he
did
not
specify
which
provision
of
the
deal
he
was
concerned
about
a
spokeswoman
for
may
s
office
said
the
agreement
struck
with
the
eu
allowed
the
uk
to
sign
trade
deals
with
countries
throughout
the
world
including
with
the
united
states
we
have
already
been
laying
the
groundwork
for
an
ambitious
agreement
with
the
through
our
joint
working
groups
which
have
met
five
times
so
far
the
spokeswoman
said
under
the
deal
secured
with
eu
leaders
on
sunday
the
uk
will
leave
the
bloc
in
march
with
continued
close
trade
ties
but
the
odds
look
stacked
against
may
getting
it
approved
by
a
divided
british
parliament
