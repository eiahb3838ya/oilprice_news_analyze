britain
is
likely
to
experience
hotter
drier
summers
and
warmer
wetter
winters
by
the
as
well
as
rising
sea
levels
which
can
lead
to
floods
due
to
the
effects
of
climate
change
projections
by
the
met
office
show
to
help
homes
and
businesses
plan
for
the
future
a
report
based
on
science
from
the
met
office
and
around
the
world
sets
out
a
range
of
climate
scenarios
over
the
next
century
based
on
different
rates
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
released
into
the
atmosphere
uk
climate
projections
shows
rising
summer
temperatures
more
extreme
weather
and
rising
sea
levels
are
expected
in
britain
and
urgent
action
is
needed
even
in
the
scenario
average
annual
temperatures
are
expected
to
be
up
to
degrees
celsius
higher
by
the
end
of
the
century
in
the
scenario
summer
temperatures
could
be
up
to
higher
by
and
winters
up
to
higher
the
chance
of
a
summer
as
hot
as
this
year
is
about
percent
by
this
summer
was
the
joint
hottest
on
record
when
a
spell
of
hot
weather
saw
daytime
temperatures
in
many
parts
of
the
country
regularly
over
the
report
said
average
summer
rainfall
could
fall
by
up
to
percent
by
and
winter
rainfall
could
be
up
to
percent
higher
meanwhile
sea
levels
could
rise
by
up
to
meters
ft
by
which
increases
the
risk
of
flooding
sea
levels
are
projected
to
rise
over
the
century
and
beyond
under
all
emission
scenarios
meaning
we
can
expect
to
see
an
increase
in
both
the
frequency
and
magnitude
of
extreme
water
levels
around
the
uk
coastline
the
met
office
said
in
a
statement
although
britain
has
already
reduced
emissions
by
more
than
percent
since
the
projections
show
a
future
britain
could
face
without
further
action
it
added
the
report
was
developed
by
the
met
office
hadley
center
in
partnership
with
the
government
and
the
environment
agency
it
is
the
first
major
update
on
britain
s
climate
projections
since
this
story
corrects
seventh
paragraph
to
say
there
will
be
percent
more
rainfall
in
winter
not
less
