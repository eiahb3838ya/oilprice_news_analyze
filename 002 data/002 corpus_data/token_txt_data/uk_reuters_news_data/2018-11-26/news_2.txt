quashed

ahead
with
raising

trump
said
it
was
highly
unlikely
he
would
accept
china
s
request
to

off
on
the

ran
counter

with

harsh
report
from
the

representative
investors
have
only
the
flimsiest
hope
that
the
meeting
in
argentina
will
amount
to
more

a

limited
to
a
drop

the

remained
firm
for
the
moment
at

while
the
euro
nursed
losses
at
that
left
the
dollar
a
shade
firmer
at
against
a
basket

reaction
to
trump
s
comments
that
tariffs
could

trump
s
remarks
came

the
mood
among

had
shown
signs
of
brightening

from
an
upbeat

that
italy
was
preparing
to
rework

that
have
fuelled
tensions
with
the
european

later
said
