column-oil market power ebbs from opec to the troika: kemp
london
reuters
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
has
been
marginalised
as
critical
decisions
about
the
oil
market
are
taken
by
a
troika
of
the
united
states
russia
and
saudi
arabia
the
rise
and
subsequent
fall
in
oil
prices
this
year
has
been
almost
entirely
driven
by
production
decisions
in
these
three
countries
and
their
policies
towards
managing
the
impact
of
renewed
sanctions
on
iran
the
troika
accounted
for
million
barrels
per
day
of
crude
and
condensates
production
in
percent
of
the
global
total
compared
with
just
million
bpd
from
the
rest
of
opec
percent
of
the
global
total
troika
production
has
surged
even
further
this
year
as
shale
firms
ramped
up
output
in
response
to
higher
prices
while
russia
and
saudi
arabia
relaxed
production
curbs
put
in
place
at
the
end
of
output
from
the
troika
is
the
element
in
global
oil
supplies
which
will
likely
push
its
share
above
percent
in
while
the
rest
of
opec
falls
below
percent
statistical

bp
production
decisions
made
in
the
troika
tend
to
determine
whether
the
oil
market
will
be
or
in
the
short
to
medium
term
while
other
opec
and
countries
watch
from
the
sidelines
the
rest
of
opec
is
struggling
under
sanctions
mismanagement
and
unrest
is
too
small
to
matter
is
maximising
production
rather
than
participating
in
output
controls
or
simply
aligns
its
output
policies
with
those
of
saudi
arabia
the
only
opec
member
that
operates
an
independent
production
policy
and
has
been
able
to
increase
its
output
significantly
in
has
been
iraq
in
this
context
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
distinction
between
opec
and
members
has
become
increasingly
blurred
and
shifted
outside
the
organisation
discussion
and
analysis
have
moved
away
from
opec
s
ministerial
conference
to
the
joint
ministerial
monitoring
committee
jmmc
which
blends
opec
and
members
the
jmmc
contains
two
leading
producers
russia
and
oman
and
just
four
opec
countries
saudi
arabia
kuwait
algeria
and
venezuela
plus
the
opec
president
currently
the
united
arab
emirates
the
jmmc
s
membership
is
a
tacit
admission
that
russia
and
to
a
lesser
extent
oman
play
a
more
important
role
in
production
policy
than
most
opec
members
dividing
oil
production
into
opec
and
has
become
an
obsolete
way
of
analysing
the
oil
market
a
better
approach
recognises
a
hierarchy
of
with
varying
degrees
of
freedom
and
importance
the
inner
core
of
consists
of
saudi
arabia
and
russia
which
have
closely
coordinated
their
output
policy
during
and
act
as
the
de
facto
leaders
of
opec
and
respectively
next
comes
the
united
states
which
is
not
in
opec
and
lacks
a
unified
production
policy
but
has
a
decisive
influence
on
oil
supplies
and
prices
through
its
rapidly
growing
shale
output
and
sanctions
decisions
about
the
severity
of
sanctions
including
scope
enforcement
and
waivers
give
the
united
states
significant
influence
less
than
saudi
arabia
and
russia
but
more
than
other
opec
and
members
the
united
states
has
acted
as
a
third
member
of
the
troika
even
though
it
is
formally
forbidden
by
law
from
coordinating
production
policy
domestically
or
with
foreign
countries
recognising
their
joint
influence
policymakers
from
saudi
arabia
russia
and
the
united
states
have
regularly
briefed
one
another
about
production
decisions
and
sanctions
in
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
expressed
strong
and
clear
views
about
the
appropriate
level
of
oil
prices
and
exerted
pressure
on
saudi
arabia
the
third
level
of
the
hierarchy
consists
of
opec
members
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
and
oman
which
have
proved
willing
to
adjust
their
production
under
saudi
and
russian
leadership
the
troika
plus
kuwait
the
uae
and
oman
account
for
almost
half
of
global
liquids
production
the
fourth
level
consists
of
iraq
which
has
also
to
some
extent
coordinated
its
production
policy
with
saudi
arabia
and
russia
but
retained
much
more
independence
the
fifth
and
final
level
consists
of
all
other
opec
and
producers
which
essentially
maximise
their
output
and
are
not
part
of
the
production
control
system
in
this
hierarchical
system
production
policy
is
driven
by
initial
consultations
between
saudi
arabia
and
russia
paying
due
attention
to
the
diplomatic
requirements
and
anticipated
output
reactions
of
the
united
states
kuwait
the
uae
oman
and
later
iraq
are
then
brought
on
board
followed
eventually
by
the
rest
of
opec
and
allies
in
this
hierarchy
only
saudi
arabia
russia
and
the
united
states
are
genuinely
independent
actors
while
kuwait
the
uae
oman
and
iraq
are
important
followers
other
opec
and
members
are
largely
inconsequential
in
terms
of
and
production
outcomes
iran
which
was
a
founder
member
of
opec
and
its
important
member
through
the
has
been
pushed
out
of
the
process
by
sanctions
iran
s
exclusion
from
membership
of
the
jmmc
is
symptomatic
of
its
marginalisation
within
opec
and
the
wider
oil
market
in
this
new
system
the
locus
of
has
shifted
from
the
opec
conference
in
vienna
to
the
periodic
meetings
of
the
jmmc
and
bilateral
briefings
among
ministers
in
saudi
arabia
and
russia
took
the
critical
decision
to
start
increasing
output
in
bilateral
discussions
held
well
before
it
was
formally
ratified
by
the
opec
conference
and
then
countries
in
june
under
pressure
saudi
arabia
backed
by
russia
kuwait
the
uae
and
oman
decided
to
raise
output
further
in
september
again
outside
the
formal
opec
framework
experienced
observers
expect
the
next
round
of
critical
production
decisions
will
be
taken
at
least
in
outline
form
at
this
week
s
group
of
meeting
in
buenos
aires
rather
than
at
opec
s
formal
conference

leaders
from
all
members
of
the
troika
will
attend

their
senior
economic

energy
advisers
for
the
oil
market
it
looks
like
the
real
opec
meeting
will
come
a
week
ahead
of
schedule
according
to
javier
blas
chief
energy
correspondent
at
bloomberg
the
cartel
is
set
to
meet
on
in
vienna
but
days
earlier
the
key
decision
makers
are
set
to
gather
on
the
sidelines
of
the
summit
blas
notes
it
provides
an
opportunity
for
leaders
and
their
ministers
to
reach
an
understanding
about
the
preferred
direction
of
prices
next
year
as
oil
plunges
the
real
opec
meeting
will
be
at
next

is
increasingly

how

financial
times
as
the
balance

shifted
away
from
