and
is
eyeing
deals
in
china
and
africa
as
it
aims
to
become
a
global
leader
in
chemicals
the
head
of
the
world
s
top
oil
producer
said
on
monday
amin
nasser
chief

of
the

told
reuters
that
his
company
would
abide
by
any
opec
agreement
to
cut
crude
production
in
less
than
two
weeks
before
the
exporter
group
meets
to
decide
output
policy
but
he
added
that
he
still
sees
growth
opportunities
in
asia
identifying
china
india
malaysia
and
indonesia
and
will
push
ahead
with
refining
ventures
to
guarantee
new
outlets
for
aramco
s
crude
we
are
always
going
to
be
attempting
to
expand
our
market
share
but
at
the
same
time
the
company
is
obliged
to
meet
any
agreement
by
opec
nasser
said
in
an
interview
in
dhahran
saudi
arabia
asia
is
a
very
important
market
for
us
we
are
looking
at
two
potential
jvs
joint
ventures
for
refineries
in
china
right
now
we
continue
to
expand
our
market
share
in
different
markets
we
are
looking
at
india
we
are
looking
at
malaysia
we
are
looking
at
indonesia
we
are
looking
at
china
all
these
markets
are
very
important
to
us
and
other
markets
as
well
even
in
africa
he
added
aramco
said
last
week
it
would
sign
five
crude
oil
supply
agreements
with
chinese
customers
taking
its
supply
to
china
to
a
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
nasser
did
not
explain
how
aramco
would
meet
that
higher
demand
if
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
of
which
saudi
arabia
is
the
de
facto
leader
decided
to
restrict
production
next
year
asked
whether
the
company
planned
to
reduce
crude
exports
to
the
united
states
as
inventories
there
increase
he
said
all
markets
are
important
for
us
asia
is
the
biggest
market
for
sure
then
europe
and
the
nasser
added
that
plans
to
expand
the
company
s
motiva
refinery
in
the
united
states
and
move
into
petrochemical
production
at
that
plant
were
going
ahead
as
scheduled
opec
meets
in
vienna
on
amid
expectations
that
saudi
arabia
will
push
for
a
production
cut
of
up
to
million
bpd
by
the
producer
club
and
its
allies
to
prop
up
sagging
oil
prices
benchmark
brent
crude
was
trading
near
a
barrel
on
monday
clawing
back
some
losses
after
plunging
nearly
percent
the
previous
session
amid
fears
of
a
supply
glut
saudi
arabia
s
crude
production
has
hit
an
high
in
november
of
about
million
bpd
an
industry
source
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
on
monday
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
earlier
this
month
that
aramco
would
ship
less
crude
in
december
compared
to
november
due
to
lower
seasonal
demand
aramco
aims
to
become
a
global
leader
in
chemicals
and
the
world
s
largest
integrated
energy
firm
with
plans
to
expand
its
refining
operations
and
petrochemical
output
the
company
plans
to
raise
its
total
refining
capacity
inside
the
kingdom
and
abroad
to
million
bpd
from
around
million
bpd
now
nasser
said
we
are
the
industry
leader
when
it
comes
to
upstream
oil
and
gas
but
when
it
comes
to
downstream
even
though
we
have
a
big
position
in
refining
our
ambition
is
much
bigger
we
are
looking
at
million
bpd
in
refining
he
said
chemicals
is
a
major
area
for
expansion
we
are
going
to
be
the
global
leader
when
it
comes
to
to
get
there
aramco
is
embarking
on
the
possible
acquisition
of
a
strategic
stake
in
saudi
arabia
s
sabic
the
world
s
petrochemicals
maker
nasser
said
he
hoped
to
finalize
talks
soon
with
the
public
investment
fund
to
buy
the
sovereign
wealth
fund
s
stake
in
sabic
we
are
doing
partly
the
due
diligence
and
the
negotiations
at
the
same
time
these
things
take
time
he
said
and
then
if
we
are
able
to
conclude
the
negotiations
still
there
is
the
process
of
antitrust
in
different
countries
and
that
also
takes
some
time
we
did
not
put
a
timeframe
that
we
need
to
have
but
we
are
hoping
to
have
it
aramco
aims
to
allocate
some
million
bpd
of
its
crude
production
to
petrochemicals
