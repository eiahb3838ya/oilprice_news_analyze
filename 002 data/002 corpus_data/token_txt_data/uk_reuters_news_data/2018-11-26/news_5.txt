washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
on
monday
rejected
projections
that
climate
change
will
cause
severe
economic
harm
to
the
economy
findings
outlined
by
a
report
his
own
government
published
last
week
the
congressionally
mandated
report
said
that
climate
change
will
cost
the
country
economy
billions
of
dollars
by
the
end
of
the
century
but
trump
said
he
does
not
believe
the
economic
impacts
will
be
devastating
i
ve
seen
it
i
ve
read
some
of
it
and
it
s
fine
the
republican
president
told
reporters
at
the
white
house
asked
about
severe
economic
impacts
he
said
i
don
t
believe
the
report
was
issued
on
black
friday
the
day
after
thanksgiving
when
many
americans
traditionally
go
shopping
a
timing
that
trump
s
critics
said
was
chosen
to
bury
the
report
last
year
trump
announced
his
intent
to
withdraw
the
united
states
from
the
paris
deal
to
combat
climate
change
becoming
the
first
country
of
to
do
so
due
to
rules
he
can
not
quit
the
deal
until
after
the
presidential
election
right
now
we
re
at
the
cleanest
we
ve
ever
been
and
it
s
very
important
to
me
trump
said
but
if
we
re
clean
but
every
other
place
on
earth
is
dirty
that
s
not
so
carbon
emissions
from
industry
slipped
percent
last
year
as
coal
plants
shut
and
use
of
natural
gas
and
renewable
energy
rose
but
trump
s
critics
said
leaving
the
paris
agreement
means
the
united
states
is
allowing
others
to
lead
the
global
fight
to
curb
climate
change
trump
has
also
rolled
back
environmental
and
climate
rules
such
as
the
clean
power
plan
while
seeking
to
boost
output
of
oil
gas
and
coal
for
domestic
use
and
for
shipping
to
allies
and
partners
output
of
crude
oil
is
already
the
highest
in
the
world
above
saudi
arabia
and
russia
the
report
written
with
the
help
of
more
than
a
dozen
government
agencies
and
departments
said
the
effects
of
climate
change
would
harm
human
health
damage
infrastructure
limit
water
availability
and
alter
coastlines
agriculture
tourism
and
fishing
industries
that
depend
on
natural
resources
and
favorable
climate
conditions
would
all
be
hit
it
said
the
report
also
said
projections
of
damage
could
change
if
greenhouse
gas
emissions
were
curbed
although
many
of
the
impacts
of
climate
change
like
powerful
storms
droughts
and
flooding
have
already
begun
the
report
supplements
a
study
issued
last
year
that
concluded
humans
are
the
main
driver
of
global
warming
and
warned
of
catastrophic
effects
to
the
planet
