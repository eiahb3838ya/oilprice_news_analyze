ecuador
would
support
a
decision
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
to
cut
oil
production
when
the
group
meets
next
week
in
vienna
the
south
american
country
s
energy
minister
said
on
monday
but
ecuador
one
of
opec
s
smallest
members
does
not
expect
the
cut
to
derail
its
own
plans
to
boost
production
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
next
year
up
from
bpd
currently
as
it
seeks
to
increase
government
revenue
to
cut
its
fiscal
deficit
said
the
minister
carlos
perez
the
country
needs
these
resources
and
i
do
not
think
there
will
be
any
issue
because
our
output
is
marginal
in
the
context
of
opec
perez
said
during
a
tour
of
the
itt
oilfield
in
the
country
s
amazon
region
the
country
s
interest
comes
before
our
commitments
to
the
itt
field
is
crucial
to
those
plans
the
government
expects
output
in
the
area
to
rise
to
bpd
next
year
up
from
bpd
currently
opec
will
meet
on
amid
expectations
that
leading
producer
saudi
arabia
will
push
for
a
production
cut
of
up
to
million
bpd
by
the
producer
club
and
its
allies
to
prop
up
weak
oil
prices
we
will
support
it
because
it
will
have
a
positive
impact
perez
said
the
moment
we
get
crude
inventories
under
control
that
will
have
an
effect
on
the
price
