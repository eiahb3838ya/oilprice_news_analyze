residents
in
the
rugged
overmined
city
of
jincheng
in
northern
china
s
coal
heartland
have
been
breathing
a
little
easier
after
campaigns
to
reduce
pollution
forced
dozens
of
collieries
and
chemical
plants
to
close
everything
was
covered
in
dust
and
it
s
cleaner
now
said
zhang
haibin
a
farmer
living
in
a
largely
abandoned
hamlet
on
the
edge
of
a
defunct
coal
deposit
that
once
attracted
migrant
workers
from
across
the
country
but
jincheng
has
paid
a
heavy
price
zhang
said
factories
and
coal
mines
have
shut
down
sending
shockwaves
through
the
local
economy
the
migrants
have
drifted
away
and
jobs
are
hard
to
find
even
for
locals
and
the
air
is
still
not
clean
enough
falling
short
of
the
government
s
pollution
targets
that
means
that
as
another
punishing
campaign
gets
underway
this
winter
in
north
china
jincheng
will
be
under
even
more
pressure
the
city
s
experience
illustrates
the
challenges
facing
the
chinese
government
as
it
tries
to
rein
in
pollution
without
further
weighing
on
an
economy
that
is
showing
signs
of
a
slowdown
exacerbated
by
the
effects
of
a
bruising
trade
war
with
the
united
states
across
north
china
cities
are
struggling
to
strike
a
balance
between
reversing
the
environmental
damage
done
by
decades
of
breakneck
growth
and
keeping
their
heavy
industrial
economies
afloat
jincheng
has
done
particularly
poorly
according
to
the
central
government
a
sprawling
mountainous
administrative
region
in
the
south
of
shanxi
province
jincheng
is
still
dominated
by
coal
though
many
pits
have
been
shut
the
craggy
landscape
bears
the
scars
of
decades
of
excessive
mining
residents
say
air
quality
has
improved
but
whiffs
of
sulfur
pervade
the
city
s
industrial
districts
and
smoke
can
be
seen
billowing
from
factory
chimneys
jincheng
was
the
worst
performer
among
northern
cities
forced
to
impose
special
pollution
measures
last
year
according
to
data
from
the
ministry
of
ecology
and
environment
it
failed
to
meet
its
target
of
cutting
concentrations
of
particles
by
percent
last
winter
and
recorded
pollution
violations
the
most
of
the
cities
summoned
to
beijing
in
april
to
explain
his
city
s
poor
performance
mayor
liu
feng
said
the
city
s
gross
domestic
product
plunged
percent
and
fixed
asset
investment
percent
in
the
first
quarter
as
a
result
of
production
cuts
feng
told
officials
at
a
meeting
attended
by
reuters
that
he
was
deeply
embarrassed
and
would
seek
to
learn
painful
lessons
about
improving
compliance
this
year
feng
said
city
inspectors
had
been
too
passive
and
had
failed
to
properly
forecast
smog
or
supervise
industries
but
he
also
blamed
unfavorable
weather
conditions
as
well
as
the
city
s
industrial
structure
dominated
by
polluting
power
plants
steel
mills
and
cement
factories
the
economy
bounced
back
after
the
winter
curbs
were
lifted
with
gdp
growing
percent
from
a
year
earlier
in
the
first
three
quarters
of
according
to
the
city
s
statistics
bureau
although
fixed
asset
investment
was
still
down
percent
on
the
year
but
with
the
winter
curbs
that
took
effect
on
jincheng
like
many
cities
in
shanxi
will
again
struggle
to
reconcile
official
pollution
targets
with
their
industrial
structures
shanxi
faces
a
very
complex
situation
it
has
few
resources
and
its
supervision
capabilities
are
quite
weak
it
has
a
lot
of
different
kinds
of
challenges
said
ma
jun
director
of
the
institute
of
public
and
environmental
affairs
ipe
a
group
that
monitors
pollution
many
cities
in
shanxi
rank
the
lowest
in
the
country
when
it
comes
to
environment
law
enforcement
and
information
disclosure
ma
said
shanxi
produces
nearly
a
billion
tons
of
coal
a
year
around
a
quarter
of
the
national
total
and
despite
promises
to
promote
cleaner
energy
its
production
of
the
fossil
fuel
actually
increased
in
the
first
three
quarters
of
last
year
s
winter
smog
crackdown
was
criticized
for
a
one
size
fits
all
approach
that
failed
to
take
account
of
local
conditions
shuttering
hundreds
of
factories
whether
they
had
implemented
pollution
controls
or
not
beijing
has
promised
a
more
campaign
this
year
setting
lower
targets
and
promising
to
exempt
environmentally
compliant
firms
but
after
its
failures
last
year
jincheng
is
unlikely
to
be
treated
leniently
in
the
war
on
pollution
which
is
a
signature
policy
of
president
xi
jinping
on
monday
inspectors
said
firms
in
jincheng
had
failed
to
follow
rules
to
restrict
output
during
a
smog
outbreak
last
week
the
latest
in
a
series
of
problems
uncovered
this
year
the
city
s
coal
districts
are
now
in
a
state
of
siege
as
inspectors
scour
mines
coal
processing
facilities
chemical
plants
and
storage
depots
for
violations
this
winter
jincheng
aims
to
cut
coal
chemical
production
by
percent
and
impose
output
curbs
of
as
much
as
percent
in
certain
districts
it
will
also
establish
a
kilometer
zone
banning
household
coal
combustion
and
convert
more
than
households
to
gas
one
manager
with
shanxi
lanhua
a
local
conglomerate
involved
in
coal
chemicals
and
real
estate
said
the
city
was
under
far
greater
pressure
the
firm
will
completely
shut
down
some
of
its
subsidiaries
in
winter
and
expects
to
lose
around
million
yuan
million
in
earnings
over
the
winter
period
this
year
the
intensity
is
going
to
be
stronger
said
the
manager
who
requested
anonymity
because
he
wasn
t
authorized
to
talk
to
the
media
ma
of
the
ipe
said
polluting
firms
in
cities
like
jincheng
had
long
taken
advantage
of
the
system
their
failure
to
comply
with
costly
rules
means
they
could
outcompete
compliant
rivals
and
china
needed
to
create
a
level
playing
field
to
make
sure
lawbreakers
were
eliminated
from
the
market
but
at
a
meeting
of
china
s
parliament
in
march
delegates
from
jincheng
said
the
city
needed
more
financial
support
from
beijing
to
diversify
and
regenerate
its
economy
despite
years
of
crackdowns
jincheng
continues
to
rely
heavily
on
coal
and
while
surviving
mines
have
benefited
from
the
closure
of
smaller
rivals
related
businesses
including
local
truckers
are
struggling
with
higher
compliance
costs
and
intensifying
competition
gas
has
now
emerged
as
the
major
bright
spot
for
the
city
with
its
seams
rich
in
coalbed
methane
which
has
replaced
coal
as
a
source
of
heating
for
many
outlying
villages
but
development
will
still
take
time
the
gdp
growth
that
jincheng
wishes
to
accomplish
will
be
driven
from
gas
today
while
historically
it
would
have
been
from
coal
said
randeep
grewal
chairman
of
greka
a
unit
of
exploration
which
has
drilled
more
than
coalbed
methane
wells
in
jincheng
we
are
in
that
transition
mode
and
clearly
in
transition
you
have
a
bit
of
growing
pains
but
the
transition
is
in
the
meantime
the
legacy
of
coal
is
still
being
felt
by
residents
of
jincheng
like
zhang
the
farmer
his
sparsely
furnished
home
is
riddled
with
dangerous
cracks
the
result
of
subsidence
caused
by
mining
but
he
said
he
has
not
received
enough
compensation
from
the
state
to
move
out
they
ve
even
closed
down
livestock
farms
here
because
of
the
environmental
policies
and
lots
of
farmers
are
out
of
work
he
said
the
government
knows
how
to
ask
you
for
money
but
it
doesn
t
know
how
to
resolve
the
problems
