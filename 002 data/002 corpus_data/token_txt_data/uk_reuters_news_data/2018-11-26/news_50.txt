when

hit
its

high
the

it

in

were
fragile
keeping

their
lowest
levels
since
october
last
year
having
dived
percent
on
friday
for
the
biggest
weekly
losses
in
almost
three
years
as
rising

intensified
fears
of
a
supply
glut
so
far
this
month
both
wti

brent
futures
were
down
more
than

on

for

fall
since

unless

recoup
some
of

on

in
argentina
at
the
end
of
this

barring
any

there
the
tariffs
on

goods
introduced
in
late

are
likely
to
be
raised
to
a
proposed

next

corporate
earnings
have
hardly
been
affected
by
the
latest

it
s
in

that
we
will
see
the
impact

if
the

are
raised
further
next

further
said
mizuho
s
kuramochi
some
market
players
say
investor
worries
go
well
beyond
trade
issues
noting
the
decline
in
global
stocks
and
oil
prices
began
right
after
vice
president
mike
pence
intensified
pressure
on
china
in
a
speech
on
in
that
speech
pence
accused
china
of
malign
efforts
to
undermine
trump
and
chinese
security
agencies
of
masterminding
the
wholesale
theft
of
american
technology
including
military
blueprints
pence
s
speech
is
a
start
of
the
cold
war
said
a
currency
trader
at
a
bank
meaning
global
supply
chains
would
be
put
at
risk
and
we
have
a
slowdown
in
iphones
sales
and
all
that
bearish
factors
are
piling
up
he
said
already
the
global
economy
is
showing
cracks
with
businesses
wary
about
investment
amid
the
rising
headwinds
to
earning
growth
a
survey
on
friday
showed
euro
zone
business
growth
has
been
much
weaker
than
expected
this
month
as
slowing
global
economic
momentum
and
a
trade
war
have
led
to
a
sharp
fall

the
