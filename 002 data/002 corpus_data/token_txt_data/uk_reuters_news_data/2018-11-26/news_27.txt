president
donald
trump
has
boasted
that
falling
crude
prices
are
like
a
tax
cut
for
the
world
however
motorists
in
much
of
asia
have
yet
to
pocket
substantial
savings
from
the
recent
rout
in
oil
markets
since
its
closing
peak
of
a
barrel
on
brent
crude
has
tumbled
percent
to
end
at
on
this
decline
has
been
matched
by
the
price
of
gasoline
in
singapore
which
was
down
by
percent
from
its
peak
of
a
barrel
on
to
on
however
the
retail
price
of
gasoline
in
major
asian
countries
has
fallen
by
significantly
smaller
margins
the
pump
price
of
gasoline
in
india
s
capital
new
delhi
was
rupees
a
litre
on
according
to
price
monitoring
website
this
is
down
percent
from
the
peak
of
rupees
on
illustrating
that
the
sharp
decline
in
crude
and
gasoline
prices
has
yet
to
filter
through
to
consumers
however
the
above
calculation
doesn
t
factor
in
the
impact
of
fuel
taxes
which
in
india
are
about
of
the
retail
price
excluding
taxes
from
the
price
reveals
a
slightly
larger
percent
drop
in
the
untaxed
component
of
india
s
gasoline
price
from
the
october
peak
until
australia
s
national
average
gasoline
price
has
dropped
by
about
percent
from
a
peak
of
a
a
litre
in
the
week
to
to
a
in
the
week
to
according
to
data
from
the
australian
institute
of
petroleum
australia
s
fuel
taxes
are
about
the
same
percentage
as
those
in
india
meaning
there
has
been
a
slightly
larger
drop
in
the
untaxed
component
of
the
fuel
price
but
still
nothing
close
to
the
plunge
in
brent
china
which
has
a
managed
system
for
retail
fuel
prices
has
seen
a
lower
drop
than
india
and
australia
with
gasoline
falling
percent
to
yuan
a
litre
in
the
week
ended
according
to
data
on
the
website
it
s
likely
that
retail
gasoline
prices
will
drop
in
those
countries
in
coming
weeks
but
it
would
be
unlikely
that
they
fall
by
as
much
as
motorists
might
hope
for
given
the
slump
in
crude
asian
refiners
are
already
struggling
to
make
any
money
producing
gasoline
with
the
profit
margin
or
crack
for
making
a
barrel
of
from
brent
crude
in
singapore
at
cents
on
this
is
up
from
a
loss
of
a
barrel
on
which
was
the
weakest
crack
in
seven
years
but
still
well
below
the
peak
for
reached
on
with
profits
from
gasoline
currently
tenuous
the
scope
for
refiners
to
lower
prices
further
is
likely
constrained
in
some
ways
it
s
a
sword
for
the
region
s
refiners
as
they
can
lower
gasoline
prices
and
make
a
loss
in
the
hope
of
boosting
demand
in
order
to
remove
a
surplus
of
the
fuel
asian
refiners
are
also
in
a
quandary
over
strong
margins
for
middle
distillates
such
as
diesel
which
encourage
them
to
run
their
plants
at
high
rates
even
though
this
also
ensures
they
produce
more
gasoline
than
the
market
is
demanding
the
profit
margin
for
producing
a
barrel
of
gasoil
the
base
for
diesel
and
jet
fuel
from
dubai
crude
in
singapore
was
in
early
trade
on
monday
down
from
the
peak
of
on
but
well
above
the
low
of
from
june
given
the
strong
demand
for
diesel
and
robust
refinery
profits
it
s
no
surprise
that
the
retail
price
in
india
and
australia
has
failed
to
reflect
the
recent
decline
in
crude
diesel
in
new
delhi
was
rupees
a
litre
on
down
percent
from
the
recent
peak
of
rupees
on
the
national
average
diesel
price
in
australia
was
a
in
the
week
to
down
only
percent
from
the
recent
high
of
a
in
the
week
to
while
much
of
the
focus
in
crude
markets
has
been
on
the
supply
side
and
the
rapid
switch
from
fears
of
tightness
to
oversupply
the
demand
side
of
the
equation
shouldn
t
be
ignored
probably
the
best
method
for
producers
traders
and
refiners
of
clearing
oversupply
in
crude
markets
is
to
have
demand
gain
to
clear
the
surplus
however
given
the
modest
declines
in
retail
prices
for
gasoline
and
diesel
in
major
asian
countries
a
tightening
of
the
market
may
remain
elusive
