fishing
communities
along
africa
s
coastline
are
at
a
greater
risk
of
extinction
as
countries
eye
oceans
for
tourism
industrial
fishing
and
exploration
revenue
to
jumpstart
their
blue
economies
experts
and
activists
said
on
monday
the
continent
s
coastal
and
island
states
have
in
recent
years
moved
to
tap
ocean
resources
through
commercial
fishing
marine
tourism
and
mining
according
to
the
united
nations
economic
commission
for
africa
uneca
there
is
a
great
risk
and
a
great
danger
that
those
communities
will
be
marginalized
said
joseph
zelasney
a
fishery
officer
at
s
food
and
agriculture
organization
fao
the
resources
that
they
depend
on
will
be
decimated
he
added
at
a
side
event
at
the
blue
economy
conference
organised
by
kenya
canada
and
japan
in
nairobi
the
world
s
poorest
continent
hosts
a
blue
economy
estimated
at
trillion
but
loses
billion
a
year
to
illegal
fishing
and
logging
of
mangroves
along
the
coast
according
to
uneca
estimates
seismic
waves
generated
by
prospectors
to
search
for
minerals
oil
and
gases
along
the
ocean
floor
have
scared
away
fish
stocks
said
dawda
saine
of
the
confederation
of
african
artisanal
fishing
in
gambia
noise
and
vibration
drives
fishes
away
which
means
they
fishermen
have
to
go
further
to
fish
saine
said
pollution
from
a
vibrant
tourism
sector
and
foreign
trawlers
have
reduced
stocks
along
the
indian
ocean
salim
mohamed
a
fisherman
from
malindi
in
kenya
said
we
suffer
as
artisanal
fishers
but
all
local
regulation
just
look
at
us
as
the
polluter
and
doesn
t
go
beyond
that
he
said
the
continent
s
fish
stocks
are
also
being
depleted
by
industrial
trawlers
which
comb
the
oceans
to
feed
european
and
asian
markets
experts
say
posing
a
threat
to
livelihoods
and
food
security
for
communities
living
along
the
coast
growth
of
blue
economies
in
africa
could
also
take
away
common
rights
to
land
and
water
along
the
coastline
and
transfer
them
to
corporations
and
a
few
individuals
said
andre
standing
advisor
with
the
coalition
for
fair
fisheries
arrangements
most
of
the
land
and
beaches
along
africa
s
thousands
of
miles
of
coastline
is
untitled
making
it
a
good
target
for
illegal
acquisition
activists
said
there
is
a
great
worry
that
we
could
see
privatisation
of
areas
that
were
previously
open
to
these
communities
standing
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
we
need
to
have
a
radical
vision
that
values
communities
and
livelihoods
or
they
will
become
extinct
