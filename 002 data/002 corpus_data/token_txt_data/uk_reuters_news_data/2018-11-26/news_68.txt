uk's drax starts pilot of europeâ€™s first bioenergy carbon capture project
london
reuters
britain
s
drax
has
started
a
pilot
project
to
capture
and
store
carbon
dioxide
emissions
at
its
biomass
plant
the
first
of
its
kind
in
europe
drax
said
on
monday
carbon
capture
and
storage
ccs
involves
the
capture
of
emissions
from
power
plants
and
industry
to
allow
them
to
be
stored
underground
or
compressed
in
containers
to
be
used
for
industrial
applications
such
as
making
drinks
fizzy
the
technology
is
also
likely
to
be
needed
to
help
limit
a
rise
in
global
temperatures
at
degrees
celsius
according
to
a
recent
report
drax
said
using
the
technology
at
the
plant
in
north
yorkshire
england
that
burns
biomass
wood
pellets
often
made
from
compressed
sawdust
could
enable
the
company
to
operate
the
world
s
first
carbon
negative
power
station
when
coupled
with
ccs
the
overall
process
of
generating
electricity
from
biomass
removes
more
carbon
dioxide
from
the
atmosphere
than
it
releases
the
company
said
if
successful
the
pilot
project
will
capture
a
tonne
of
carbon
dioxide
a
day
from
the
gases
produced
when
renewable
power
is
generated
drax
said
in
a
statement
drax
said
the
will
initially
be
stored
on
site
but
that
eventually
it
will
seek
to
find
a
use
for
the
gas
such
as
in
the
drinks
industry
which
earlier
this
year
was
hit
with
a
shortage
britain
has
a
target
to
cut
its
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
percent
compared
with
levels
by
but
has
asked
its
climate
change
experts
to
advise
on
whether
it
should
set
a
date
to
meet
a
net
zero
emissions
target
a
report
by
the
united
nations
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
in
october
warned
not
meeting
the
goal
to
limit
rising
temperatures
at
degrees
would
mean
huge
changes
to
the
world
such
as
rising
sea
levels
heat
and
loss
of
species
