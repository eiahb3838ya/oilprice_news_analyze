norwegian
gas
system
operator
gassco
and
canadian
energy
firm
enbridge
are
working
on
reviving
a
megawatt
mw
offshore
wind
project
to
boost
power
supply
security
at
norway
s
nyhamna
gas
processing
plant
they
told
reuters
the
project
which
would
be
the
country
s
first
offshore
wind
farm
is
called
havsul
and
was
fully
licensed
by
norwegian
energy
regulators
in
before
being
abandoned
in
due
to
profitability
concerns
and
insufficient
subsidies
nyhamna
is
one
of
norway
s
biggest
gas
processing
plants
handling
output
from
shell
s
ormen
lange
field
its
capacity
was
raised
to
million
cubic
meters
mcm
per
day
this
year
to
accommodate
gas
from
the
aasta
hansteen
field
however
the
plant
s
power
supply
is
fed
by
a
single
grid
line
the
fragility
of
which
has
caused
outages
in
recent
years
affecting
exports
to
britain
gassco
spokeswoman
lisbet
kallevik
said
the
company
was
undertaking
a
technical
study
for
enbridge
evaluating
the
possibility
of
a
of
havsul
to
the
nyhamna
plant
the
study
was
expected
to
be
completed
by
spring
the
windmill
project
will
if
decided
secure
power
supply
for
the
nyhamna
processing
plant
and
the
region
for
years
to
come
she
said
the
additional
capacity
at
nyhamna
means
the
need
for
a
reliable
power
supply
is
increasing
but
discussions
to
upgrade
the
power
line
between
gassco
and
state
grid
statnett
have
failed
to
produced
results
havsul
with
a
capacity
to
produce
about
terawatt
hour
twh
of
electricity
annually
would
not
only
benefit
the
gas
plant
but
also
feed
the
local
grid
enbridge
told
reuters
our
intention
is
to
enter
into
a
commercial
agreement
with
nyhamna
gas
processing
facility
to
supply
a
dedicated
source
of
renewable
electricity
also
enhancing
security
of
supply
for
the
facility
and
local
grid
spokeswoman
mandy
dinning
said
adding
the
partners
would
only
be
able
to
reach
a
final
investment
decision
after
initially
havsul
was
part
of
a
larger
plan
to
construct
three
offshore
wind
farms
with
around
megawatts
capacity
but
norway
s
regulator
rejected
the
other
farms
the
estimated
cost
for
havsul
was
up
to
billion
crowns
million
at
the
time
of
its
licensing
since
then
the
project
s
rights
have
changed
ownership
twice
with
enbridge
securing
its
licenses
earlier
this
year
however
development
costs
for
offshore
wind
have
fallen
since
havsul
was
abandoned
in
while
norway
said
last
year
it
would
offer
some
concessions
for
such
projects
