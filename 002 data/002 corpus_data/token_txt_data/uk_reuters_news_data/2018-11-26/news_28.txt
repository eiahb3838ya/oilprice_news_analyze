speaking
to

before
a
new
round
of
climate
talks
in
katowice
poland
on
how
to
implement
the
paris
agreement
although
we
have
encountered
a
lot
of
difficulties
a
lot
of
problems
our
targets
and
our
resolution
will
not
change
he
added
china
the
world
s
biggest
source
of
carbon
dioxide
has
pledged
to
halt
its
rise
in
emissions
by
around
through
cleaner
forms
of
energy
boosting
efficiency
and
encouraging
industries
however
overseas
researchers
have
suggested
that
china
s
emissions
already
reached
a
peak
of
gigatonnes
in
and
declined
in
the
three
years
that
followed
suggesting
that
beijing
s
targets
were
far
too
conservative
president
donald
trump
said
last
year
that
he
would
pull
out
of
the
agreement
arguing
that
it
was
too
lenient
on
china
xie
said
trump
s
decision
to
withdraw
hurt
the
confidence
and
resolution
of
many
other
countries
but
its
impact
was
now
beginning
to
wane
and
china
s
own
commitments
to
clean
development
were
unbending
china
has
already
met
a
target
to
cut
carbon
intensity
the
amount
of
emissions
per
unit
of
economic
growth
by
percent
from
levels
by
and
it
is
also
on
course
to
bring
the
share
of
fuels
to
percent
of
total
energy
consumption
by
the
end
of
the
decade
xie
said
china
was
the
world
s
biggest
investor
in
renewable
energy
and
is
in
the
process
of
establishing
the
world
s
largest
carbon
trading
exchange
he
added
xie
said
he
hoped
developed
countries
would
honor
their
commitments
to
the
paris
agreement
and
provide
the
promised
financial
and
technical
support
to
poorer
nations
he
also
called
on
nations
to
use
the
upcoming
meeting
to
reaffirm
their
commitment
to
combating
climate
change
we
hope
that
this
meeting
can
send
out
a
strong
political
signal
that
these
economic
powers
should
continue
to
make
efforts
to
carry
out
the
paris
agreement
and
sustainable
development
goals
