reuters
venezuela
s
oil
ministry
last
month
turned
down
a
proposal
by
bp
to
buy
total
s
stake
in
a
promising
but
inactive
natural
gas
project
along
the
maritime
border
with
trinidad
and
tobago
five
people
briefed
on
the
matter
said
bp
owns
the
rights
to
the
trinidadian
side
of
the
gas
play
it
could
have
used
the
output
from
the
neighbouring
area
the
deltana
platform
s
fourth
block
off
venezuela
s
eastern
coast
to
feed
its
growing
operations
on
the
island
said
the
people
who
were
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
the
rejection
highlights
how
venezuela
s
socialist
government
often
hostile
to
foreign
companies
remains
an
obstacle
to
investment
even
as
oil
majors
eye
the
opec
nation
s
barely
tapped
gas
reserves
to
expand
their
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
portfolios
the
ministry
told
the
parties
the
area
s
reserves
needed
to
be
an
argument
it
has
used
to
reject
other
deals
two
of
the
people
said
the
deal
had
been
waiting
for
approval
for
two
years
france
s
total
said
in
a
march
filing
that
the
sale
of
its
percent
stake
was
awaiting
approval
from
the
norway
s
equinor
owns
the
other
percent
an
equinor
spokesman
said
it
finished
exploration
drilling
years
ago
but
declined
to
comment
on
total
s
plans
gas
investment
could
help
venezuela
which
has
the
world
s
largest
crude
reserves
compensate
for
lack
of
capital
for
its
oil
industry
whose
production
continues
plummeting
amid
a
political
and
economic
crisis
venezuela
s
mostly
undeveloped
gas
reserves
were

at
the

to

the

is
pushing
venezuela
to
let
it
produce
gas
in
the
offshore
dragon
field
close
to
its
hibiscus
platform
off
trinidad
there
s
a
real
shortage
of
gas
supply
in
the
downstream
industries
in
trinidad
said
tanvir
malik
a
research
analyst
at
the
economist
intelligence
unit
total
s
attempt
to
sell
comes
as
some
western
oil
firms
seek
to
shrink
their
venezuelan
operations
as
reputational
risk
grows
amid
sanctions
and
corruption
probes
linked
to
government
officials
and
oil
company
pdvsa
shell
requested
approval
this
year
to
sell
its
only
crude
asset
in
venezuela
to
french
firm
maurel
prom
total
recently
downgraded
its
venezuelan
projects
to
the
lowest
investment
category
implying
it
could
continue
looking
for
buyers
two
company
sources
said
bp
declined
to
comment
venezuela
s
oil
ministry
and
total
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
venezuelan
law
requires
pdvsa
to
take
a
majority
stake
in
crude
oil
joint
ventures
but
is
more
flexible
with
gas
allowing
foreign
firms
to
individually
operate
projects
through
exploration
and
production
licenses
but
ownership
changes
in
gas
projects
are
still
subject
to
regulatory
approval
and
the
government
is
required
to
provide
an
explanation
for
rejections

eugenio

the

mckenzie

under

hugo
chavez
pdvsa
tried
to
take
control
of
prominent
gas
projects
including
the
deltana
and
mariscal
sucre
offshore
plays
both
close
to
trinidad
with
total
estimated
reserves
of
about
tcf
neither
project
has
yet
started
commercial
production
due
to
long
delays
stemming
from
lack
of
funds
and
disputes
over
control
between
pdvsa
and
the
private
companies
it
is
really
difficult
for
a
foreign
investor
to
feel
comfortable
with
venezuelan
laws
applied
in
practice
said
we
don
t
have
the
financial
resources
or
technical
expertise
for
developing
natural
gas
projects
whereas
trinidad
has
the
expertise
and
the
backing
of
foreign
while
once
an
afterthought
to
crude
oil
big
oil
is
focusing
increasingly
on
natural
gas
as
global
demand
for
less
fuels
rises
and
lng
facilitates
international
gas
trading
both
shell
and
bp
