the
united
nations
climate
conference
in
the
polish
city
of
katowice
went
into
overtime
on
saturday
after
intensive
shuttle
diplomacy
overnight
by
ministers
negotiators
and
delegates
from
nearly
countries
trying
to
find
common
ground
on
rules
to
implement
the
paris
agreement
initially
scheduled
to
end
on
friday
the
polish
presidency
of
the

plenary
session
after
it
released
a
draft
of
the
deal
as
it
holds
last
minute
talks
with
various
parties
to
smooth
out
differences
a
plenary
has
been
scheduled
for
gmt
on
saturday
while
the
time
of
a
final
joint
closing
session
has
been
changed
a
few
times
in
the
last
two
hours
one
sticking
point
that
has
held
up
the
negotiations
is
the
issue
of
emissions
counting
cited
in
article
of
the
paris
agreement
regarding
mechanisms
to
combat
climate
change
under
the
article
countries
should
agree
to
rules
to
ensure
they
do
not
double
count
emissions
reductions
a
senior
negotiator
told
reuters
that
brazil
was
still
obstructive
on
this
issue
and
did
not
want
clear
rules
to
prevent
double
counting
which
is
unacceptable
to
many
nations
bits
and
pieces
of
the
draft
agreement
were
published
early
on
saturday
but
the
main
body
of
the
text
is
still
to
be
released
meanwhile
the
sprawling
spodek
sports
and
concert
venue
has
started
to
resemble
a
ghost
town
in
the
wait
for
the
latest
draft
text
and
the
final
plenary
as
support
services
start
their
work
of
dismantling
the
temporal
sections
of
the
venue
including
exhibition
pavilions
water
food
and
coffee
is
running
low
in
some
sections
of
the
venue
haggard
activists
observers
and
reporters
try
to
catch
a
quick
sleep
on
their
desks
chairs
and
wherever
they
can
some
hope
the
talks
will
not
drag
on
until
sunday
fearing
potential
complications
in
their
families
plans
for
christmas
however
some
are
changing
their
travel
plans
with
the
latest
postponement
of
the
final
joint
plenary
to
later
on
saturday
afternoon
as
the
talks
in
katowice
draw
to
a
close
participants
of
the
annual
climate
