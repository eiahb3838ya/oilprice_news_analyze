during

trump
said
on
twitter
the
trump
administration
will
be
announcing
the
new
secretary
of
the
interior
next
zinke
has
run
the
interior
department
which
oversees
america
s
vast
public
lands
since
early
he
has
aggressively
pursued
trump
s
agenda
to
promote
oil
drilling
and
coal
mining
by
expanding
federal
leasing
cutting
royalty
rates
and
easing
land
protections
despite
environmental
protests
zinke
was
among
trump
s
most
active
cabinet
members
cutting
huge
wilderness
national
monuments
in
utah
to
a
fraction
of
their
size
and
proposing
offshore
oil
drilling
in
the
arctic
pacific
and
atlantic
he
became
a
darling
of
the
energy
and
mining
industries
and
a
prime
target
for
conservationists
and
environmental
groups
senate
democratic
leader
chuck
schumer
welcomed
zinke
s
departure
in
a
tweet
ryan
zinke
was
one
of
the
most
toxic
members
of
the
cabinet
in
the
way
he
treated
our
environment
our
precious
public
lands
and
the
way
he
treated
the
govt
like
it
was
his
personal
honey
the
swamp
cabinet
will
be
a
little
less
foul
without
him
schumer
said
jamie
williams
president
of
the
wilderness
society
said
he
expects
zinke
s
deputy
and
likely
successor
david
bernhardt
to
continue
with
the
drill
everywhere
agenda
deputy
secretary
bernhardt
has
made
it
his
mission
to
stifle
climate
science
and
silence
the
public
so
polluters
can
profit
said
williams
unfortunately
even
with
secretary
zinke
out
the
interior
department
remains
disturbingly
biased
in
favour
of
special
interests
over
the
health
of
american
communities
and
the
public
lands
that
they
critics
have
questioned
zinke
s
ethics
and
some
of
his
moves
triggered
government
investigations
in
july
the
interior
department
s
office
of
inspector
general
began
investigating
a
montana
land
deal
between
a
foundation

set
up
and
a
development
group
backed
by
the
chairman
of
oil
service
company
halliburton
co
which
has
business
with
the
interior
department
in
late
october
that
investigation
was
referred
to
the
justice
department
for
a
possible
criminal
investigation
according
to
multiple
media
reports
the
department
of
justice
and
the
interior
department
have
declined
to
comment
there
are
two
other
investigations
of
zinke
s
conduct
interior
s
watchdog
is
examining
whether
the
department
purposely
redrew
the
boundaries
of
utah
s
grand
national
monument
to
benefit
a
state
lawmaker
who
owns
adjoining
property
it
is
also
probing
zinke
s
decision
to
block
casinos
proposed
by
two
connecticut
native
american
tribes

allege
he
made
that
move
overruling

met
with
lobbyists
for
mgm
resorts

which
owns
a
new
casino
in
the

s
travel
expenses
those
probes
found
that
a
private
flight
he
took
after
a
meeting
with
a
professional
hockey
team
could
have
been
avoided
and
that
the
security
detail
he
took
on
a
family
vacation
to
greece
and
turkey
cost
taxpayers

repeatedly
praised
