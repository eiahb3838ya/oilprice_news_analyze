update 3-nations agree global climate pact rules, but seen as weak
katowice
poland
reuters
nearly
countries
overcame
political
divisions
late
on
saturday
to
agree
on
rules
for
implementing
a
landmark
global
climate
deal
but
critics
say
it
is
not
ambitious
enough
to
prevent
the
dangerous
effects
of
global
warming
after
two
weeks
of
talks
in
the
polish
city
of
katowice
nations
finally
reached
consensus
on
a
more
detailed
framework
for
the
paris
agreement
which
aims
to
limit
a
rise
in
average
world
temperatures
to
well
below
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
above
levels
it
is
not
easy
to
find
agreement
on
a
deal
so
specific
and
technical
through
this
package
you
have
made
a
thousand
little
steps
forward
together
you
can
feel
proud
polish
president
of
the
talks
michal
kurtyka
told
delegates
after
he
struck
the
gavel
to
signal
agreement
had
been
reached
ministers
joined
him
on
the
stage
hugging
and
laughing
in
signs
of
relief
after
the
marathon
talks
before
the
talks
started
many
expected
the
deal
would
not
be
as
robust
as
needed
the
unity
which
underpinned
the
paris
talks
has
fragmented
and
president
donald
trump
intends
to
pull
his
country
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
emitters
out
of
the
pact
at
the
hour
ministers
managed
to
break
a
deadlock
between
brazil
and
other
countries
over
the
accounting
rules
for
the
monitoring
of
carbon
credits
deferring
the
bulk
of
that
discussion
to
next
year
but
missing
an
opportunity
to
send
a
signal
to
businesses
to
speed
up
their
actions
still
exhausted
ministers
managed
to
bridge
a
series
of
divides
to
produce
a
rulebook
which
is
broken
down
into
themes
such
as
how
countries
will
report
and
monitor
their
national
pledges
to
curb
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
update
their
emissions
plans
not
everyone
is
happy
with
everything
but
the
process
is
still
on
track
and
it
is
something
to
build
on
several
ministers
said
while
some
rulebook
elements
still
need
to
be
fleshed
out
it
is
a
foundation
for
strengthening
the
paris
agreement
and
could
help
facilitate
into
the
paris
agreement
by
a
future
presidential
administration
said
alden
meyer
of
the
union
of
concerned
scientists
some
countries
and
green
groups
criticised
the
outcome
for
failing
to
urge
increased
ambitions
on
emissions
cuts
sufficiently
to
curb
rising
temperatures
poorer
nations
vulnerable
to
climate
change
also
wanted
more
clarity
on
how
an
already
agreed
billion
a
year
of
climate
finance
by
will
be
provided
and
on
efforts
to
build
on
that
amount
further
from
the
end
of
the
decade
a
statement
by
ant√≥nio
guterres
who
left
the
talks
on
thursday
stressed
the
need
for
more
work
from
now
on
my
five
priorities
will
be
ambition
ambition
ambition
ambition
and
ambition
it
said
and
ambition
must
guide
all
member
states
as
they
prepare
their
emissions
cut
plans
for
to
reverse
the
present
trend
in
which
climate
change
is
still
running
faster
than
a
report
by
the
ipcc
in
october
warned
that
keeping
the
earth
s
temperature
rise
to
degrees
c
would
need
unprecedented
changes
in
every
aspect
of
society
last
week
saudi
arabia
the
unites
states
russia
and
kuwait
refused
to
use
the
word
welcome
in
association
with
the
findings
of
the
report
the
decision
text
now
merely
expresses
gratitude
for
the
work
on
the
report
welcomes
its
timely
completion
and
invites
parties
to
use
the
information
in
it
for
many
states
and
islands
at
risk
from
rising
sea
levels
this
is
not
strong
enough
but
had
to
be
accepted
grudgingly
in
exchange
for
other
during
the
two
weeks
of
talks
in
katowice
in
the
mining
region
of
silesia
a
focus
on
the
fossil
fuel
industry
provided
an
unwelcome
distraction
for
some
countries
and
environmental
groups
which
want
to
focus
on
cleaner
energy
the
conference
itself
has
been
hosted
by
poland
which
has
sought
to
protect
its
mining
industry
the
administration
s
only
event
in
katowice
was
seen
as
trying
to
rebrand
coal
as
a
potentially
clean
energy
