the
last
stumbling

have
been
around
the
ambition
of
developed
countries

countries
more
vulnerable

are
trying

a

still
had
concerns
over
the

aimed
at
avoiding
double

emissions

chief
negotiator
told

countries
are
on
a
deadline
to
produce
a
rulebook
to
flesh
out
details
of
the
paris
agreement
which
aims
to
limit
the
global
temperature
rise
to
less
than
degrees

in
talks
in
katowice
have
been
going
on
for
two
weeks
and
were
due
to
end
on
but
they
have
been
clouded
by
political
divisions
a
rift
last
week
over
how
to
express
the
importance
of
a
commissioned
report
on
keeping
global
warming
within
a
degrees
celsius
limit
appears
to
have
been
calmed
with
language
changed
to
note
rather
than
welcome
the
report
talks
have
also
faltered
over
increasing
finance
for
climate
adaptation
for
poorer
countries
governments
have
already
agreed
to
raise
billion
a
year
by
but
developing
countries
wanted
more
the
latest
text
says
a
meeting
in
will
start
deliberations
to
increase
that
amount
