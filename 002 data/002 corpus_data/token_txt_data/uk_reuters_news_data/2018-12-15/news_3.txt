iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
praised
opec
on
saturday
for
what
he
said
was
the
producer
group
s
ability
to
reach
agreement
despite
intense
internal
political
differences
the
organisation
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
allies
agreed
on
to
cut
output
by
more
than
expected
despite
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
reduce
the
price
of
crude
opec
has
shown
the
capacity
in
which
members
can
hold
talks
and
reach
important
results
regarding
their
common
interests
despite
having
the
most
intense
political
disputes
or
even
military
conflicts
such
as
during
the
war
zanganeh
said
on
twitter
the
opec
deal
had
hung
in
the
balance
for
two
days
first
on
fears
that
russia
would
cut
too
little
and
later
on
concerns
that
iran
whose
crude
exports
have
been
depleted
by
sanctions
would
receive
no
exemption
and
block
the
agreement
