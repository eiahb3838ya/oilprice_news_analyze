us pressing gulf states to keep syria isolated - sources
dubai
reuters
the
united
states
is
lobbying
gulf
states
to
hold
off
restoring
ties
with
syria
including
the
uae
which
has
moved
closer
to
damascus
to
counter
the
influence
of
its
rival
iran
five
sources
told
reuters
the
opposing
approaches
are
an
early
test
of
whether
syrian
president
bashar
can
gain
political
and
diplomatic
credibility
after
a
nearly
civil
war
turned
him
into
an
international
pariah
many
countries
cut
links
with
syria
at
the
start
of
the
war
several
gulf
states
shut
or
downgraded
their
embassies
syria
was
suspended
from
the
arab
league
flights
stopped
and
border
crossings
were
closed
the
united
states
and
other
countries
imposed
economic
sanctions
washington
backed
by
gulf
countries
saudi
arabia
and
qatar
does
not
want
syria
welcomed
back
into
the
international
community
until
a
political
process
to
end
the
war
is
agreed
the
saudis
are
quite
helpful
in
pressing
the
others
qatar
also
is
doing
the
right
thing
said
a
official
when
asked
about
the
diplomatic
pressure
the
official
said
that
the
united
states
was
pleased
that
some
gulf
states
are
putting
the
brakes
on
the
position
suggests
that
assad
is
still
a
long
way
from
being
accepted
even
after
his
forces
reclaimed
most
of
syria
through
victories
over
sunni
rebels
thanks
largely
to
help
from
iran
and
russia
the
lack
of
support
from
washington
and
regional
heavyweight
riyadh
to
end
syria
s
isolation
will
make
it
harder
for
the
devastated
country
to
attract
investment
needed
to
rebuild
it
while
the
uae
believes
sunni
muslim
states
must
embrace
syria
swiftly
in
order
to
move
assad
out
of
shi
ite
iran
s
orbit
saudi
arabia
and
qatar
back
the
approach
the
uae
sees
assad
as
the
only
option
according
to
one
gulf
source
and
believes
that
stemming
iranian
influence
in
syria
could
help
prevent
the
kind
of
hold
it
now
has
in
iraq
during
the
war
the
uae
did
support
armed
groups
opposed
to
assad
but
its
role
was
less
prominent
than
that
of
saudi
arabia
and
qatar
and
its
support
was
mostly
to
do
with
ensuring
that
islamist
forces
did
not
dominate
the
uprising
and
saudi
officials
have
spoken
to
representatives
of
other
gulf
countries
urging
them
not
to
restore
ties
with
syria
three
gulf
political
sources
a
official
and
a
senior
western
diplomat
said
they
particularly
want
to
ensure
that
those
countries
do
not
back
syria
s
return
to
regional
organisation
the
arab
league
and
that
embassies
are
kept
closed
or
operating
with
only
junior
staffing
with
assad
strengthening
his
position
militarily
relations
with
some
countries
have
started
to
thaw
the
uae
reopened
its
damascus
embassy
in
december
this
was
a
major
boost
for
assad
and
the
united
states
gave
the
emiratis
flak
said
the
official
a
uae
official
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
in
the
last
seven
years
there
has
been
absolutely
zero
arab
influence
in
syria
zero
arab
influence
has
been
a
disaster
uae
minister
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
anwar
gargash
told
reporters
in
a
recent
briefing
in
washington
he
said
abu
dhabi
diplomatic
ties
with
damascus
to
be
closer
to
the
reality
on
the
ground
gargash
said
more
arab
states
need
to
engage
to
crowd
the
space
taken
by
russia
and
iran
who
support
assad
and
turkey
which
backs
the
rebels
the
next
step
for
syria
s
international
rehabilitation
could
be
reinstatement
to
the
arab
league
which
would
be
largely
symbolic
but
something
assad
s
government
would
likely
use
to
show
its
return
from
the
diplomatic
wilderness
the
league
said
last
monday
that
there
was
not
yet
the
necessary
consensus
for
this
to
happen
and
the
united
states
is
pushing
hard
to
ensure
it
does
not
according
to
the
sources
washington
is
lobbying
against
it
and
saudi
arabia
and
egypt
are
working
to
slow
down
the
readmittance
of
syria
in
the
arab
league
said
the
senior
western
diplomat
government
media
offices
in
saudi
arabia
the
united
arab
emirates
bahrain
and
oman
s
foreign
ministry
did
not
respond
to
a
reuters
request
for
comment
a
kuwaiti
foreign
ministry
official
declined
to
comment
on
whether
kuwait
had
been
asked
by
washington
or
riyadh
to
hold
off
on
normalising
ties
and
reiterated
the
country
s
stance
that
any
possible
return
of
relations
with
it
can
only
be
through
the
arab
league
not
all
arab
league
nations
severed
ties
with
syria
after
the
outbreak
of
the
war
in
oman
maintained
diplomatic
ties
with
damascus
a
day
after
the
uae
reopened
its
embassy
bahrain
said
its
embassy
in
damascus
and
the
syrian
diplomatic
mission
in
manama
had
been
operating
without
interruption
kuwait
s
deputy
foreign
minister
said
in
december
it
would
reopen
its
embassy
in
damascus
once
the
arab
league
allowed
it
saudi
arabia
has
no
plans
now
to
normalise
ties
said
one
gulf
official
adding
everything
is
suspended
until
syrians
agree
a
transition
from
assad
s
rule
rival
qatar
has
said
it
sees
no
encouraging
signs
for
restoring
normal
relations
its
foreign
minister
said
in
january
but
abu
dhabi
hopes
it
can
eventually
sway
syria
towards
the
uae
model
and
dubai
can
play
a
role
as
a
hub
for
trade
with
syria
abu
dhabi
last
month
hosted
a
syrian
delegation
led
by
prominent
businessman
mohammad
hamsho
to
discuss
potential
cooperation
in
trade
infrastructure
agriculture
tourism
logistics
and
renewable
energy
state
media
reported
gargash
acknowledged
however
that
real
investment
would
not
happen
without
a
political
process
a
second
senior
western
diplomat
said
that
without
a
political
process
it
would
be
difficult
for
sanctions
to
be
removed
which
would
clear
the
way
for
investment
i
don
t
think
this
is
the
end
of
the
war
and
time
for
reconstruction
