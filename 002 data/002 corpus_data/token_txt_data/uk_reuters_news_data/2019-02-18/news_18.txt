the

asking

as
he
was
not
authorised
to
speak
to
the

it
was
not
clear
why
china
had

up
checks
on

the
reason
china
has
curbed
coal
imports
in
the
past
to
support
domestic
coal
miners
and
reduce
consumption
to
tackle
air
pollution
it
restricted
indonesian
coal
imports
in

high
impurities
and
low

efficiency
the

said
the

time
for
beijing
to
curb
coal

a
specific
country
