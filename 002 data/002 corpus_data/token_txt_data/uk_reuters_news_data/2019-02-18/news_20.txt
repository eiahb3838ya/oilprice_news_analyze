david
vickers
senior

manager
at
russell

adding
much
focus
was
now
on

now
reassert
themselves
vickers
added
a
run
of
soft
economic
data
has
fuelled
expectations
that
the
world
s
most
powerful
central
banks
could
deliver
on
reflationary
policies
and
provide
support
for
markets
the
need
for
stimulus
was

hikes
this
year
there
is
also
talk
the

will
keep
a
much
larger
balance
sheet
than
previously
planned
given
the

of
speakers
since
