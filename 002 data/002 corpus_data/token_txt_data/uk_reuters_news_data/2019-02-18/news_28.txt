saudi
arabia
has
eased
concerns
about
oversupply
by
acting
as
swing
producer
cutting
output
promptly
despite
poor
compliance
from
other
members
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
allies
a
group
known
as
sanctions
on
iran
and
venezuela
have
also
removed
significant
volumes
of
oil
from
the
market
especially
heavy
crudes
adding
to
the
sudden
tightening
of
the
supply
side
at
the

time
traders
have
become
more
optimistic
trade
negotiations
between
the
united
states
and
china
will
avoid
the
imposition
of
new
tariffs
on
march

avert
a
global
recession

growth
may
not

hedge
fund
sales
forced
an
abrupt
change
in
strategy
by
in

fourth
quarter
as
the
global
economy
and
oil
consumption
outlook
deteriorated
but
now
the
producer
group
has
shifted
course
hedge
fund
buying
has
accelerated
the
recent
rise
in
brent
prices
providing
saudi
arabia
with
an
early
payoff
for
production
cuts
and
validating
strategy
and
because
hedge
fund
positions
tend
to
be
concentrated
in

nearest

which
offer

liquidity
buying
has
also
accelerated
