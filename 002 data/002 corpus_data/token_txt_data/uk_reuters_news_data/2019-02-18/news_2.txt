oil
rose
for
a
fifth
day
on
monday
on
track
for
its
strongest
first
quarter
in
eight
years
thanks
to
a
growing
belief
among
investors
that
opec
s
supply
cuts
will
prevent
a
in
unused
fuel
though
concern
over
china
s
economy
tempered
gains
brent
futures
were
last
up
cents
at
a
barrel
by
gmt
having
touched
a
high
of
earlier
in
the
day
while

rose
cents
to
a
barrel
oil
has
risen
nearly
percent
so
far
this
year
and
is
on
course
for
its
strongest
performance
since
thanks
largely
to
a
commitment
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
allies
to
cut
output
our
numbers
do
tell
us
that
we
are
looking
at
the
tightest
crude
balance
in
many
years
and
as
such
a
certain
degree
of
price
support
does
simply
make
sense
for
the
time
being

said
in
a
note
refiners
around
the
world
are
also
having
to
pay
more
to
secure
supplies
of
the
medium
or
heavy
sour
crudes
produced
by
iran
and
venezuela
both
of
which
are
under
sanctions
the
broader
financial
markets
eased
a
little
after
data
showing
a
drop
in
chinese
car
sales
in
january
raised
concerns
about
the
world
s
economy
some
of
this
weakness
rubbed
off
on
the
oil
market
but
analysts
said
the
overall
trend
in
crude
prices
remained
convincingly
upwards
for
now
there
are
lots
of
ifs
and
buts
that
could
have
a
profound
impact
on
oil
prices
just
think
of
the
unpredictable

brexit
trade
talks
or

eventual

point
in
the
direction
of
a
tightening
market
it
is
not
recommended
to
swim
against
the
current
and
presently
the
oil
river
is
flowing
some
analysts
said
the
continued
rise
in
oil
production
could
act
as
a
drag
on
the
current
rally
energy
companies
last
week
increased
the
number
of
oil
rigs
looking
for
new
supply

said
in

last

we
view
the
current

rise
as
exaggerated
and

said
in
a
note
the
fact
that
oil
production
in

is
currently
rising
significantly
more
sharply
than
previously
expected
is
being
completely
ignored
