almost
a
decade
after
norway
signed
a
deal
with
indonesia
to
help
protect
its
tropical
forests
the
first
payment
for
reduced
emissions
will
be
made
after
deforestation
rates
fell
environmentalists
and
government
officials
said
indonesia
imposed
a
moratorium
on
under
the
climate
deal
with
payments
linked
to
the
southeast
asian
nation
s
progress
on
lowering
emissions
from
felling
trees
which
release
carbon
when
they
rot
or
are
burned
indonesian
environment
and
forestry
minister
siti
nurbaya
bakar
and
norwegian
climate
and
environment
minister
ola
elvestuen
agreed
the
first
payments
would
be
made
after
deforestation
rates
dropped
in
according
to
a
statement
issued
on
saturday
by
the
norwegian
embassy
in
jakarta
no
details
were
provided
on
the
payment
amount
although
green
groups
estimate
the
figure
to
be
about
million
it
is
a
big
deal
because
it
reflects
the
fact
that
indonesia
has
turned
a
corner
and
that
is
great
news
for
all
of
us
said
oyvind
eggen
director
of
the
rainforest
foundation
norway
we
want
to
see
from
indonesia
that
this
is
a
trend
and
not
a
event
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
home
to
the
world
s
tropical
forests
indonesia
is
also
the
biggest
producer
of
palm
oil
environmentalists
blame
much
of
the
forest
destruction
on
land
clearance
for
plantations
deforestation
and
forest
fires
continue
to
blight
many
parts
of
the
country
while
revisions
to
the
moratorium
have
lacked
transparency
environmental
campaigners
say
by
november
indonesia
s
forest
moratorium
covered
an
area
of
more
than
million
hectares
million
acres
in
an
attempt
to
tackle
its
annual
haze
from
fires
on
deforested
land
indonesia
switched
its
focus
from
containment
to
prevention
after
a
particularly
bad
outbreak
in
that
cost
the
country
billion
and
left
more
than
people
suffering
respiratory
ailments
the
fires
in
were
one
of
the
key
reasons
we
are
moving
now
said
forest
expert
eggen
on
the
climate
deal
s
progress
there
had
been
a
shift
in
political
will
and
greater
transparency
from
indonesia
over
the
last
four
years
he
noted
indonesia
confirmed
on
saturday
that
carbon
emissions
from
deforestation
declined
in
once
independently
verified
payments
for
about
million
tonnes
of
avoided
emissions
will
be
made
the
norwegian
embassy
statement
said
new
measures
introduced
by
the
indonesian
government
including
a
ban
on
destroying
primary
forests
and
peatlands
and
limiting
palm
oil
expansion
were
critical
said
norwegian
minister
elvestuen
future
under
the
billion
deal
would
be
made
when
further
deforestation
progress
was
proven
eggen
said
he
urged
jakarta
to
strengthen
and
extend
its
moratorium
to
include
secondary
forests
areas
that
have
been
cleared
but
where
woody
vegetation
has
again
taken
over
of
forestry
concessions
with
a
high
deforestation
risk
a
more
transparent
approach
and
protecting
the
interests
of
indigenous
people
were
also
key
eggen
said
the
commitment
is
there
but
now
it
depends
clearly
on
whether
indonesia
continues
to
reduce
deforestation
