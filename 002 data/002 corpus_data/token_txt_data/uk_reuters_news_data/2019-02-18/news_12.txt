reuters
for
yaya
niass
who
cuts
hair
in
a
roadside
shack
on
the
outskirts
of
dakar
the
time
for
political
change
in
senegal
and
in
africa
as
a
whole
is
well
overdue
we
are
late
in
terms
of
development
compared
to
other
continents
so
i
expect
from
the
next
president
from
the
next
african
presidents
that
they
work
to
be
in
power
for
the
people
he
said
as
the
country
prepares
to
elect
a
new
leader
on
sunday
niass
who
grew
up
in
france
and
lived
there
until
did
not
say
who
he
will
vote
for
but
was
sure
he
wanted
to
see
fundamental
changes
in
the
country
the
african
people
are
really
tired
we
make
do
but
i
think
states
really
have
the
power
to
change
senegal
was
on
a
good
path
he
said
but
just
one
group
of
senegalese
that
live
really
well
in
comfort
while
all
the
rest
suffer
that
needs
