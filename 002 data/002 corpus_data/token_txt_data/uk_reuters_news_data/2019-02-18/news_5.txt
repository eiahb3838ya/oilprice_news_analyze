dealers
said
the
market
was
supported
by
a
diminished
outlook
for
sugar
production
in
the
key
region
of
brazil
this
year
due
partly
to
a
lack
of
rainfall
in
january
and
the
first
half
of
this

a
relatively
poor
sugar
supply
from
cs
brazil
this

is
on

of

spectron
said
in
a
market
update
he
added
however
that
sugar
could
not
sustain
a
major
rally
there
is
simply
too
much
extra
supply
which
will
occur
if
sugar
prices
rally
substantially
much
more
sugar
from

brazil
if
sugar
prices
are
above
the

parity
and

more

he
said
some
mills
in

switch
between
producing
either
sugar
