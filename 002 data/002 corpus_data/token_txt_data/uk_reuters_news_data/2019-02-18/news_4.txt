the
bid
for
the
power

once

against
the

fighting
to
prevent
their
flagship
steel
asset
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
global

creditors
are
selling
many
of
the

little
say
over
who
buys
the

was
not
immediately
available
for
comment
if
the
steel
giant
manages
to
clinch
the
deal
for
the

would
be
yet
another
blow

attempt
to
renegotiate
debt
settlements
and
retain
control
of
their
assets
