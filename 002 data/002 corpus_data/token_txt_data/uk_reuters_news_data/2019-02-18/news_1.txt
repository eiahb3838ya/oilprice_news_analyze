paris
reuters
french
president
emmanuel
macron
will
describe
brexit
as
a
call
in
a
speech
in
coming
weeks
in
which
he
will
outline
how
europe
must
be
more
assertive
in
the
face
of
rival
world
powers
sources
close
to
macron
said
his
words
are
intended
as
a
warning
shot
for
a
continent
unable
to
project
power
and
defend
itself
said
aides
who
described
the
speech
as
macron
s
most
important
since
he
spoke
at
the
sorbonne
university
in
paris
in
september
urging
fundamental
reform
of
the
european
union
this
is
a
critical
time
a
source
close
to
macron
told
reuters
if
we
europeans
don
t
want
to
have
other
brexits
and
become
trapped
in
a
naive
defence
of
status
quo
we
have
to
wake
macron
s
speech
coincides
with
rising
tensions
in
the
west
which
has
been
shaken
by
president
donald
trump
s
america
first
policies
and
britain
s
departure
from
the
eu
a
more
assertive
china
and
russia
also
pose
major
challenges
although
macron
will
use
britain
s
planned
departure
from
the
eu
on
march
as
the
main
impetus
for
his
speech
the
aim
is
not
to
offer
an
initiative
to
unblock
the
negotiating
stalemate
between
london
and
brussels
the
source
said
macron
s
office
said
on
monday
the
speech
will
be
at
end
of
february
or
early
march
although
the
exact
date
and
location
had
not
yet
been
fixed
he
won
t
comment
on
the
negotiation
or
offer
some
kind
of
macron
plan
to
fix
the
problem
the
idea
is
to
draw
the
lessons
from
brexit
the
source
said
in
macron
s
view
brexit
is
part
of
the
same
phenomenon
that
brought
trump
to
power
and
sparked
the
yellow
vest
movement
in
france
a
fear
of
losing
out
from
globalisation
territorial
inequalities
and
rising
contempt
for
the
establishment
the
french
leader
will
focus
on
championing
a
europe
that
protects
in
the
may
european
election
and
seek
to
convince
voters
with
plans
aimed
at
reforming
europe
s
trade
competition
digital
and
climate
policies
the
speech
will
also
seek
to
convince
his
european
counterparts
who
have
watered
down
many
of
his
sorbonne
proposals
since
to
start
thinking
of
the
eu
as
a
tougher
geopolitical
player
in
a
ruthless
world
the
eu
has
done
the
internal
regulation
rather
well
built
a
nice
peaceful
area
with
benign
trade
and
regulated
competition
but
europe
hasn
t
understood
how
to
carry
itself
in
a
brutal
world
