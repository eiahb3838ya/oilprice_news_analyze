update 14-oil jumps as opec agrees to modest output hikes
new
york
reuters
oil
prices
soared
on
friday
after
oil
producers
agreed
to
modest
crude
output
increases
to
compensate
for
losses
in
production
at
a
time
of
rising
global
demand
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
other
top
crude
producers
meeting
in
vienna
agreed
to
raise
output
from
july
by
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
the
real
increase
however
will
be
around
bpd
according
to
iraq
because
several
countries
that
recently
suffered
production
declines
will
struggle
to
reach
full
quotas
while
other
producers
may
not
be
able
to
fill
the
gap
the
actual
output
increases
set
a
bullish
tone
as
they
came
in
below
some
of
the
highest
figures
that
had
been
discussed
prior
to
the
meeting
there
was
a
lot
of
anticipation
in
the
market
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
lot
of
new
oil
coming
to
market
and
that
isn
t
going
to
happen
at
least
for
now
said
john
kilduff
a
partner
at
again
capital
we
were
teased
with
an
increase
of
about
million
barrels
per
day
at
one
point
and
we
ended
up
getting
about

brent
crude
settled
up
or

crude
rose
or

to
a

getting
an
additional
boost
after
a
surprise
large
drawdown
at
the
storage
hub
at

oklahoma
brent
crude
was
up

on
the
week
while

in

crude
continued
to

brent

crude
s
discount
to
brent
narrowed
by
about
percent
to
in
the
session
making
it
the
smallest
since
may
for
about
three
weeks
ahead
of
the
opec
meeting
prices
had
retreated
from
highs
on
fears
that
larger
production
increases
could
lead
to
oversupply
ultimately
saudi
arabia
persuaded
iran
to
cooperate
with
the
plan
to
cut
output
following
calls
from
major
consumers
to
curb
rising
fuel
costs
opec
s
decision
confused
some
in
the
market
as
the
producers
gave
opaque
targets
for
the
increase
making
it
difficult
to
understand
precisely
how
much
more
it
will
pump
the
expectation
that
the
increase
will
fall
short
of
the
million
bpd
figure
boosted
the
market
the
effective
increase
in
output
can
easily
be
absorbed
by
the
market
harry
tchilinguirian
head
of
oil
strategy
at
french
bank
bnp
paribas
told
the
reuters
global
oil
forum
you
think
about
million
bpd
coming
back
online
it
s
not
going
to
happen
instantaneously
it
s
going
to
take
time
said
brian
lerose
the
senior
technical
analyst
at
icap
international
marker
brent
traded
above
a
barrel
for
several
years
until
dropping
to
almost
in
and
then
recovering
to
over
last
month
the
most
recent
price
rally
followed
an
opec
decision
to
restrict
supply
in
an
effort
to
drain
global
inventories
the
group
started
withholding
supply
in
and
this
year
amid
strong
demand
the
market
tightened
significantly
triggering
calls
by
consumers
for
higher
supply
falling
production
in
venezuela
and
libya
as
well
as
the
risk
of
lower
output
from
iran
as
a
result
of
sanctions
have
all
increased
market
worries
of
a
supply
shortage
crude
futures
extended
their
rally
during
the
session
trading
as
much
as
a
barrel
above
the
second
month
contract
that
was
the
biggest
premium
since
august
the
spread
eased
slightly
to
settle
at
about
a
barrel
a
large
decline
in
inventories
at
the
storage
hub
of
cushing
oklahoma
helped
trigger
the
rally
traders
said
storage
has
fallen
as
gulf
coast
refiners
have
soaked
up
crude
that
was
available
at
a
discount
said
bob
yawger
director
of
energy
at
mizuho
the
result
is
lower
inventories
at
the
hub
for
at
least
seven
weeks
he
said
drillers
cut
the
number
of
rigs
drilling
for
oil
by
one
to
the
first
cut
in
weeks
according
to
a
weekly
report
from
ge
s
baker
hughes
division
the
rig
count
is
a
leading
indicator
of
production
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
cut
their
bullish
wagers
on
crude
futures
and
options
to
the
lowest
in
nearly
eight
months
as
crude
fell
percent
as
production
soared
