update 7-opec agrees modest hike in oil supply after saudi and iran compromise
vienna
reuters
opec
agreed
on
friday
on
a
modest
increase
in
oil
production
from
next
month
after
its
leader
saudi
arabia
persuaded
iran
to
cooperate
following
calls
from
major
consumers
to
curb
rising
fuel
costs
but
the
agreement
failed
to
announce
a
clear
target
for
the
output
increase
leaving
traders
guessing
how
much
more
opec
will
actually
pump
oil
prices
rose
by
to
a
barrel
president
donald
trump
was
among
those
wondering
how
much
more
oil
opec
will
deliver
hope
opec
will
increase
output
substantially
need
to
keep
prices
down
trump
wrote
on
twitter
after
opec
announced
its
decision
the
united
states
china
and
india
had
urged
oil
producers
to
release
more
supply
to
prevent
an
oil
deficit
that
could
undermine
global
economic
growth
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
said
in
a
statement
that
it
would
raise
supply
by
returning
to
percent
compliance
with
previously
agreed
output
cuts
but
gave
no
concrete
figures
saudi
arabia
said
the
move
would
translate
into
a
nominal
output
rise
of
around
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
or
percent
of
global
supply
iraq
said
the
real
increase
would
be
around
bpd
because
several
countries
that
had
suffered
production
declines
would
struggle
to
reach
full
quotas
by
avoiding
setting
individual
country
targets
the
deal
appears
to
give
saudi
arabia
the
leeway
to
produce
more
than
its
official
opec
target
and
fill
the
gap
left
by
those
like
venezuela
who
can
not
pump
enough
to
meet
their
official
allocation
iran
opec
s
producer
had
demanded
opec
reject
calls
from
trump
for
an
increase
in
oil
supply
arguing
that
he
had
contributed
to
a
recent
rise
in
prices
by
imposing
sanctions
on
iran
and
fellow
member
venezuela
trump
slapped
fresh
sanctions
on
tehran
in
may
and
market
watchers
expect
iran
s
output
to
drop
by
a
third
by
the
end
of
that
means
the
country
has
little
to
gain
from
a
deal
to
raise
opec
output
unlike
top
oil
exporter
saudi
arabia
however
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
convinced
his
iranian
peer
bijan
zanganeh
to
support
the
increase
just
hours
before
friday
s
opec
meeting
opec
and
its
allies
have
since
last
year
been
participating
in
a
pact
to
cut
output
by
million
bpd
the
measure
had
helped
rebalance
the
market
in
the
past
months
and
lifted
oil
to
around
per
barrel
from
as
low
as
in
but
unexpected
outages
in
venezuela
libya
and
angola
have
effectively
brought
supply
cuts
to
around
million
bpd
in
recent
months
the
output
boost
agreed
on
friday
had
been
largely
priced
into
the
market
and
was
seen
as
modest
it
will
be
enough
for
now
but
not
enough
for
the
fourth
quarter
to
address
a
decline
in
iranian
and
venezuelan
exports
said
gary
ross
head
of
global
oil
analytics
at
s
p
global
there
isn
t
a
lot
of
spare
capacity
in
the
world
if
we
lose
a
million
bpd
of
output
from
venezuela
and
iran
in
the
fourth
quarter
where
will
all
these
barrels
come
from
we
are
in
for
higher
prices
for
longer
he
said
falih
has
warned
the
world
could
face
a
supply
deficit
of
up
to
million
bpd
in
the
second
half
of
and
that
opec
s
responsibility
was
to
address
consumers
worries
we
want
to
prevent
the
shortage
and
the
squeeze
that
we
saw
in
falih
said
referring
to
a
time
when
oil
rallied
close
to
per
barrel
opec
s
deal
to
release
more
supply
centres
on
returning
to
percent
compliance
with
existing
agreed
cuts
current
compliance
is
around
percent
above
target
because
of
production
outages
in
venezuela
libya
and
angola
as
a
group
we
can
meet
the
percent
compliance
as
individual
countries
it
is
challenging
said
united
arab
emirates
energy
minister
suhail
bin
mohammed
zanganeh
has
said
that
if
opec
returned
to
regular
compliance
the
group
would
raise
output
by
around
bpd
iran
has
objected
to
having
members
with
additional
capacity
such
as
saudi
arabia
fill
venezuelan
output
gaps
both
saudi
and
iran
can
show
that
they
won
an
opec
delegate
said
zanganeh
can
go
back
to
his
country
and
say
i
won
because
we
are
keeping
the
original
agreement
unchanged
falih
can
go
back
and
say
we
will
be
able
to
raise
production
to
meet
market
needs
opec
and
producers
will
meet
on
saturday
to
iron
out
details
of
the
pact
and
then
again
in
september
to
review
the
deal
the
next
formal
opec
meeting
