india
is
environmental
clearances
for
projects
like
power
plants
and
coal
mines
in
a
bid
to
propel
growth
setting
off
alarm
bells
among
environmentalists
and
affected
residents
who
say
the
decisions
are
being
made
too
quickly
in
a
country
where
state
machinery
typically
moves
slowly
the
environment
ministry
under
prime
minister
narendra
modi
has
slashed
the
average
time
taken
to
grant
clearances
to
days
from
days
said
two
government
sources
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
matter
we
re
standardizing
processes
and
taking
decisions
swiftly
said
one
of
the
officials
who
did
not
want
to
be
named
citing
government
policy
we
know
the
basic
issues
and
merely
taking
more
time
for
approvals
does
not
mean
the
environment
ministry
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
the
push
appears
to
be
similar
to
president
donald
trump
s
efforts
to
speed
up
infrastructure
approvals
his
administration
has
said
it
wants
environmental
reviews
for
major
projects
to
take
no
longer
than
months
instead
of
years
india
s
industrial
sector
grew
at
percent
last
year
but
growth
slowed
from
percent
a
year
ago
the
speedier
approvals
come
as
some
infrastructure
projects
face
delays
including
the
proposed
billion
industrial
corridor
and
the
billion
bullet
train
any
loss
of
jobs
from
slowing
growth
could
hurt
modi
as
he
seeks
a
second
term
in
environmental
group
greenpeace
says
india
s
construction
sector
and
power
plants
are
major
contributors
to
rising
levels
of
particulate
matter
in
the
air
the
world
health
organization
says
india
is
home
to
the
world
s
most
polluted
cities
the
index
which
measures
the
concentration
of
particulate
matter
of
microns
diameter
or
less
in
the
air
hit
in
the
capital
new
delhi
last
week
the
highest
measure
on
monitoring
devices
this
coarse
particulate
matter
is
mostly
dust
which
attaches
to
toxic
material
from
other
emissions
a
level
of
is
considered
hazardous
and
people
are
advised
to
remain
indoors
the
government
halted
construction
activities
in
the
capital
and
nearby
cities
to
ease
the
pollution
and
by
friday
afternoon
it
was
at
although
that
is
still
considered
unhealthy
the
way
in
which
in
the
last
ten
years
government
has
allowed
power
plants
to
come
up
in
the
periphery
of
delhi
and
its
surrounding
region
is
a
major
contributor
to
pollution
said
sunil
dahiya

campaigner
with
greenpeace
projects
across
the
country
cleared
by
the
environment
ministry
this
year
include
three
new
thermal
power
plants
a
carbon
black
manufacturing
facility
two
cement
plants
and
the
expansion
of
four
coal
mines
according
to
government
data
faster
clearances
can
certainly
compromise
the
quality
of
evaluation
said
srestha
banerjee
program
manager
at
the
private
centre
for
science
and
environment
by
standardizing
terms
of
references
for
various
sectors
the
government
has
tried
to
reduce
time
in
the
environment
clearance
process
this
is
not
a
bad
step
but
in
order
to
reduce
time
it
has
exempted
public
hearing
for
some
important
sectors
this
is
