i
m
not
sure
it
s
a
victory
for
iran
they
were
kind
of
isolated
here
to
the
extent
they
get
the
blame
for
higher
prices
it
s
not
welcome
news
for
their
customers
especially
those
who
have
signaled
they
will
continue
buying
from
them
despite
opec
has
once
again
the
impact
should
be
price
positive
all
they
agreed
to
was
to
get
back
to
percent
compliance
at
the
group
level
million
bpd
less
than
october
production
levels
that
barely
moves
the
mark
on
aggregate
opec
levels
of
production
oil
markets
should
remain
tight
as
a
result
they
were
very
elusive
on
actual
figures
and
seem
to
have
abandoned
individual
country
targets
no
information
on
who
will
make
up
for
the
shortfall
was
announced
markets
were
expecting
larger
production
increases
prices
should
rise
as
a
the
real
rise
in
supply
for
opec
and
will
probably
be
around
bpd
barrels
per
day
it
will
be
enough
for
now
but
not
enough
for
to
address
a
decline
in
iranian
and
venezuelan
exports
plus
there
isn
t
a
lot
of
spare
capacity
in
the
world
if
we
lose
a
million
bpd
of
output
from
venezuela
and
iran
in
where
will
all
these
barrels
come
from
we
are
in
for
higher
prices
for
harry
tchilinguirian

of
commodities

paribas
the
effective
increase
in
output
can
easily
be
absorbed
by
the
market
and
is
not
going
to
tip
the
oil
balance
into
negative
territory
so
i
suspect
the
market
will
continue
to
grind
higher
notably
in
view
of
oil
inventories
in
the
oecd
being
below
the
famous
average
target
and
the
ever
present
risk
of
supply
outages
in
venezuela
and
libya
and
eventually
there
will
be
some
shuttering
of
supply
in
iran
as
start
having
a
negative
impact
on
the
country
s
in
the
short
term
we
are
likely
to
see
crude
oil
being
supported
by
continued
risks
related
to
supply
concerns
from
venezuela
and
not
least
iran
as
the
deadline
for
the
implementation
of
sanctions
approaches
these
concerns
may
however
eventually
be
replaced
by
a
shifting
focus
towards
a
continued
rise
in
supply
and
not
least
demand
growth
which
may
begin
to
suffer
due
to
a
slowdown
among
emerging
market
opec
was
likely
to
agree
to
raise
output
but
the
increase
is
slightly
more
than
we
assumed
based
on
our
previously
published
balance
we
expect
opec
crude
output
to
increase
by
about
bpd
by
the
end
of
the
year
assuming
libya
s
oil
output
can
rebound
to
bpd
this
agreement
is
consistent
with
those
expectations
though
we
see
a
slight
upside
risk
in
saudi
uae
and
kuwaiti
output
expectations
compared
with
our
going
into
the
real
opec
meeting
today
followed
by
tomorrow
the
recommendation
to
the
members
after
longer
than
expected
discussions
and
debates
yesterday
is
for
a
formal
increase
of
million
bpd
to
be
split
with
some
calculations
which
will
result
in
a
real
increase
anywhere
between
bpd
iran
is
however
not
fully
clear
on
allowing
a
formal
consensus
as
it
tries
to
push
its
acceptance
of
it
with
a
formal
condemnation
