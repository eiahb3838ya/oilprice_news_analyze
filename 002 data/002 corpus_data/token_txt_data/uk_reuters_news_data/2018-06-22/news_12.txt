renewable energy seeks demand, investment to survive trump squeeze

reuters
the
wind
and
solar
industries
hope
demand
for
power
from
cities
states
and
corporations
can
offset
headwinds
from
president
donald
trump
s
tax
policy
and
tariffs
developers
said
this
week
the
trump
tax
overhaul
trimmed
production
and
investment
tax
credits
and
the
administration
also
slapped
a
percent
tariff
on
imported
solar
panels
the
moves
aimed
at
boosting
manufacturing
and
economic
growth
also
dimmed
prospects
for
renewables
but
trump
s
withdrawal
of
federal
support
for
climate
goals
indirectly
helped
the
industry
by
inspiring
a
backlash
among
cities
states
and
corporations
which
have
grown
more
ambitious
about
installing
cleaner
forms
of
energy
also
investors
with
years
of
deals
under
their
belts
are
less
wary
about
financing
solar
and
wind
than
they
were
years
ago
and
socially
responsible
funds
are
actively
seeking
projects
to
invest
in
according
to
executives
and
investors
at
the
renewable
energy
finance
street
in
new
york
gregory
wetstone
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
american
council
on
renewable
energy
noted
that
two
big
solar
projects
worth
about
billion
total
have
been
canceled
or
stalled
since
the
tariffs
were
announced
in
january
the
solar
energy
industries
association
has
said
the
tariffs
would
result
in
the
loss
of
jobs
but
some
manufacturers
and
developers
have
announced
new
projects
in
the
face
of
the
tariffs
wetstone
noted
that
solar
led
all
generation
sources
with
gigawatts
of
new
capacity
in
the
first
quarter
of
there
is
a
sea
change
in
demand
for
renewable
energy

about
billion

in
the
sector
said
in
an
interview
on
the
sidelines
of
the
conference
on
tuesday
more
and
more
corporations
and
consumers
are
saying
we
want
percent
renewable
energy
she
said
adding
city
and
state
governments
are
adopting
policies
to
reflect
that
growing
demand
she
cited
a
survey
of
financial
institutions
that
showed
of
respondents
planned
to
boost
renewable
investments
this
year
some
percent
said
they
would
sharply
increase
planned
investments
from
now
to
unless
government
policies
slow
demand
for
renewable
energy
craig
cornelius
president

nrg
renewables
told
a
panel
at
the
conference
that
while
trump
s
tax
bill
was
initially
worrying
it
has
been
ultimately
easier
to
work
through
the
repercussions
than
we
as
the
bill
moved
through
congress
republican
lawmakers
from
states
with
renewable
projects
joined
democrats
to
make
changes
the
final
version
kept
percent
of
the
investment
tax
credit
and
production
tax
credit
values
and
dropped
a
proposed
corporate
alternative
minimum
tax
that
would
have
made
the
tax
credits
less
valuable
members
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle

out
to
support

laura

said
on
wednesday
avangrid
is
developing
the
vineyard
wind
project
off
the
coast
of
massachusetts
quick
action
helped
many
developers
dodge
harm
from
tariffs
on
solar
cells
noted
stacey
kusters
president

hathaway
energy
co
s
bhe
solar
a
lot
of
the
projects
that
were
planned
went
in
and
bought
two
years
worth
of
panels
before
the
tariffs
she
said
meanwhile
the
industry
is
bracing
for
the
scheduled
reduction
and
ultimate
expiry
of
lucrative
subsidies
on
solar
and
wind
power
over
the
coming
years
including
a
percent
tax
credit
on
solar
installations
this
will
make
it
trickier
to
finance
some
renewable
projects
said
robert
sternthal
managing
director
at
rubicon
capital
advisors
who
is
putting
together
a
team
of
bankers
to
advise
on
renewable
deals
in
north
america
without
the
incentives
pricing
may
have
to
go
up
on
the
electricity
side
for
some
projects
he
said
on
tuesday
yet
he
also
expects
growing
demand
from
tech
corporations
that
have
pledged
to
be
and
will
not
rely
on
wind
or
solar
energy
for
profits
google
facebook
and
apple
don
t
have
to
make
to
percent
returns
on
these
assets
he
said
improvements
in
technology
could
help
make
wind
and
solar
more
competitive
in
terms
of
cost
and
sustainability
after
tax
credits
expire

rafael

whose
projects
include

solar
geothermal
and

beane
said
avangrid
renewables
is
betting
on
prospects
for
a
lot
of
demand
for
offshore
wind
power
in
the
the
company
starts
construction
on
the
vineyard
wind
project
next
year
and
it
is
slated
to
come
online

she
said
the

may
be
competitive
on
