australia
no
longer
faces
a
looming
gas
shortage
thanks
to
government
pressure
on
exporters
to
divert
the
commodity
into
local
markets
and
a
reduced
demand
forecast
for
power
according
to
estimates
from
the
nation
s
energy
market
operator
no
supply
gaps
are
forecast
before
under
expected
market
conditions
the
australian
energy
market
operator
aemo
said
on
friday
in
its
annual
outlook
for
gas
that
is
starkly
different
from
a
year
ago
when
dire
warnings
from
the
body
about
potential
shortfalls
in
eastern
australia
from
onward
prompted
the
government
to
threaten
to
curb
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
exports
the
nation
s
three
east
coast
lng
plants
operated
by
royal
dutch
shell
conocophillips
and
santos
averted
those
curbs
by
promising
to
plug
the
expected
deficit
their
moves
combined
with
greater
availability
of
lng
on
the
global
market
the
of
a
new
pipeline
from
the
northern
territory
to
queensland
and
growth
in
wind
and
solar
power
diminishing
the
need
for
power
have
eliminated
the
feared
shortage
aemo
said
alongside
international
market
changes
newly
committed
electricity
generation
resources
have
resulted
in
a
favourable
increase
of
gas
availability
for
the
east
coast
market
aemo
executive
general
manager
david
swift
said
in
a
statement
more
than
megawatts
of
wind
and
solar
power
are
due
to
start
up
in
the
next
two
years
which
should
ease
demand
for
power
except
when
renewable
generation
is
low
he
said
aemo
cut
its
gas
consumption
forecast
for
by
petajoules
from
its
last
estimate
made
in
september
while
increasing
its
gas
production
outlook
from
fields
in
the
southern
states
by
pj
in
september
it
had
predicted
a
supply
gap
of
between
pj
and
pj
for
or
up
to
percent
of
market
demand
an
extra
pj
of
gas
has
also
been
freed
up
for
the
local
market
as
a
global
lng
glut
has
given
overseas
buyers
more
supply
choice
aemo
said
while
producers
told
the
market
operator
output
would
increase
from
southern
gas
fields
aemo
s
forecasts
still
show
that
further
exploration
and
development
will
be
needed
to
meet
demand
from
as
early
as
swift
said
production
forecasts
from
gas
producers
show
an
increase
in
output
of
pj
between
and
aemo
said
while
flagging
those
new
supplies
will
be
more
costly
to
produce
than
existing
production
the
sharply
changed
view
has
not
deterred
groups
considering
importing
lng
to
southeastern
australia
within
the
next
two
years
as
they
see
the
assumptions
on
future
gas
production
as
bullish
and
view
lng
import
terminals
as
much
cheaper
to
install
than
developing
new
gas
fields
for
the
sake
of
a
new
entrant
and
a
compelling
certain
product
i
just
think
imports
win
hands
down
said
james
baulderstone
chief
executive
of
australian
industrial
energy
one
of
at
least
three
groups
considering
importing
