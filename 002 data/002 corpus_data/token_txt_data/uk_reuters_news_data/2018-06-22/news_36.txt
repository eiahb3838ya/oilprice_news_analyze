defence
and
financial
sectors
have
been
prolonged
every

months
since

being

after

annexed
the
peninsula

from
kiev
and
backed
rebels
fighting
government
troops
in
east

the

then
the
leaders
of

leading
powers
have
used
their
annual
meetings
to
coordinate
their
stance
this

they
called
on
moscow
to
stop
undermining
democracies
and
said
in
their
statement
we
recall
that

continuation

is
clearly
linked
to

to
demonstrate
complete
implementation

its
commitments
in
the
peace
minsk
agreements
and
respect
for
ukraine
s
italian

at
the

the
first
major
international

the
head
of
the
new
populist
government
italy
thinks
it
is
important
to
have
a
dialogue
with
russia
but
this
does
not
mean
that
the
system
of
sanctions
can
be
overcome
overnight
conte
has
said
the
eu
is
also
at
loggerheads
with
russia
over
its
role
in
the
war
in
syria
and
elsewhere
in
the
middle
east
as
well
as
the
kremlin

track
record
on
human
rights
