k
enyan
farmer
sam
mung
ala
once
struggled
to
feed
his
family
by
growing
cowpeas
and
sorghum
these
days
he
is
betting
on
a
new
type
of
merchandise
shopping
bags
the
farmer
from
kibwezi
town
in
the
country
s
south
is
planting
and
selling
sisal
a
source
of
fibre
that
roadside
vendors
and
market
traders
use
to
make
carrier
bags
a
kilo
used
to
sell
for
kenyan
shillings
but
now
it
can
fetch
up
to
shillings
since
the
plastic
ban
he
said
crouching
to
sharpen
a
machete
at
his
farm
last
year
kenya
passed
a
law
aimed
at
reducing
plastic
pollution
whereby
kenyans
producing
selling
or
even
using
plastic
bags
risk
imprisonment
of
up
to
four
years
or
fines
of
big
supermarket
chains
like
france
s
carrefour
and
kenya
s
nakumatt
have
already
started
offering
customers
cloth
bags
as
alternatives
creating
demand
for
fibre
like
sisal
said
robert
gituru
a
botanist
at
the
jomo
kenyatta
university
of
agriculture
and
technology
farmers
are
taking
more
interest
in
sisal
due
to
the
growing
demand
for
shopping
bags
made
with
plant
fibre
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
sisal
provides
a
greener
alternative
to
plastic
as
it
decomposes
faster
and
can
be
recycled
as
farm
manure
he
said
kenya
is
the
world
s
producer
of
sisal
after
brazil
and
tanzania
said
dickson
kibata
technical
officer
at
the
government
s
agriculture
and
food
authority
and
it
generates
about
billion
shillings
million
in
annual
revenue
but
that
could
rise
to
billion
shillings
million
in
the
next
five
years
if
demand
for
sisal
keeps
growing
he
said
the
kenyan
government
is
encouraging
farmers
to
invest
in
the
crop
kibata
said
for
example
by
hosting
a
conference
later
this
year
for
farmers
and
businessmen
on
alternatives
to
plastic
such
as
plant
fibre
mung
ala
who
said
sisal
can
cope
with
kenya
s
arid
weather
used
to
grow
only
a
small
strip
of
the
crop
on
the
edge
of
his
field
now
he
has
a
full
acre
of
land
one
quarter
of
his
farm
sprouting
with
sisal
plants
the
prospects
look
good
i
even
have
road
sellers
coming
to
the
farm
to
buy
my
produce
said
mung
ala
who
is
considering
devoting
half
of
his
land
to
sisal
farming
back
in
the
capital
nairobi
it
is
and
the
shores
of
the
nairobi
dam
on
the
edges
of
kibera
slum
are
buzzing
with
activity
a
group
of
students
volunteers
and
government
officials
are
collecting
plastic
and
paper
to
help
clean
up
the
capital
s
spare
water
reservoir
which
is
faced
with
choking
pollution
this
has
to
stop
said
yohana
gikara
a
community
worker
leading
a
team
of
volunteers
planting
trees
to
rehabilitate
the
dam
without
plastics
our
wetlands
can
have
a
future
he
said
picking
up
plastic
trash
from
a
makeshift
toilet
bags
made
with
plant
fibre
like
sisal
can
help
the
slum
battle
its
plastics
problem
he
said
however
according
to
juliette
biao
koudenoukpo
the
regional
director
of
the
environment
programme
unep
alternatives
such
as
sisal
come
at
a
cost
a
sisal
bag
costs
about
double
the
price
of
a
plastic
bag
and
poor
people
can
not
afford
to
buy
them
in
bulk
to
minimise
the
cost
said
biao
this
worries
mercy
nyaga
a
nairobi
housewife
who
does
her
weekly
shop
at
the
neighbourhood
mall
although
she
tries
to
cloth
bags
she
often
has
to
buy
new
ones
to
carry
all
of
her
groceries
this
is
causing
me
to
overspend
my
budget
she
said
kibata
hopes
the
solution
to
that
lies
in
increased
sisal
production
by
farmers
like
mung
ala
as
that
could
help
to
cut
the
for
customers
or
he
said
supermarkets
might
decide
to
hand
out
free
sisal
bags
dionysious
kihika
kiambi
a
scientist
at
kenya
s
pan
africa
christian
university
said
an
additional
factor
could
be
to
use
sisal
seeds
that
can
withstand
pests
for
example
that
could
help
farmers
increase
their
yields
and
further
accelerate
the
of
sisal
in
the
country
that
would
also
reduce
the
amount
of
polluting
chemicals
used
to
tackle
pests
