kenya
airways
will
resume
aviation
fuel
hedging
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
after
price
volatility
drove
up
its
costs
the
airline
s
ceo
said
on
friday
the
carrier
which
is
percent
owned
by
air
france
klm
suspended
fuel
hedging
in
after
contract
losses
sent
it
deeper
into
the
red
following
a
prolonged
business
slump
and
a
jump
in
finance
costs
chief
executive
officer
sebastian
mikosz
said
the
recent
increase
in
the
price
of
brent
crude
had
driven
up
fuel
costs
a
quarter
of
its
total
costs
forcing
a
rethink
on
hedging
the
volatility
of
the
fuel
price
has
been
really
tremendous
addressing
this
is
our
utmost
concern
he
told
a
news
conference
after
the
company
s
annual
meeting
kenya
airways
suspended
hedging
at
a
time
when
it
was
struggling
to
cope
with
a
sharp
drop
in
air
travel
to
kenya
due
to
militant
attacks
and
concerns
about
an
ebola
outbreak
in
west
africa
the
airline
has
since
restructured
billion
of
debt
and
mikosz
said
now
was
the
time
for
a
very
lean
mean
conservative
policy
of
buying
insurance
against
fuel
price
volatility
i
m
absolutely
confident
that
in
the
third
or
fourth
quarter
of
this
year
kenya
airways
will
start
opening
hedge
policies
again
you
can
expect
some
hedging
disclosures
next
year
he
said
kenya
airways
has
also
opened
talks
with
the
kenya
airports
authority
kaa
the
state
organisation
that
runs
all
kenyan
airports
on
a
partnership
that
would
allow
it
to
run
nairobi
s
main
airport
such
a
deal
which
could
come
into
effect
before
the
end
of
this
year
would
provide
the
airline
with
fresh
revenue
streams
such
as
landing
fees
from
other
carriers
said
chairman
michael
joseph
citing
the
example
of
rivals
for
us
to
compete
with
them
gulf
carriers
and
to
offer
the
same
benefits
that
they
offer
we
need
to
almost
copy
them
he
told
the
news
conference
the
proposal
would
enable
kenya
airways
to
increase
its
fleet
from
to
and
start
flying
to
new
international
destinations
by
an
official
government
document
seen
by
reuters
showed
mikosz
said
the
airline
remained
interested
in
potential
