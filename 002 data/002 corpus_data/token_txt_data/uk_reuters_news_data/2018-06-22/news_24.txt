brexit poses risk to international power cables - norway's grid

britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
could
leave
companies
planning
to
build
more
power
interconnections
at
the
mercy
of
possible
new
trading
arrangements
and
potential
tariffs
norway
s
grid
operator
statnett
said
statnett
and
britain
s
national
grid
agreed
before
the
brexit
vote
to
construct
the
first
interconnector
between
the
two
countries
by
a
separate
consortium
of
norwegian
energy
companies
and
sweden
s
vattenfall
is
seeking
to
build
a
second
cable
by
for
about
billion
euros
billion
pounds
brexit
could
mean
that
new
trading
arrangements
may
be
required
to
sell
power
via
the
interconnectors
as
britain
might
not
be
allowed
to
participate
in
the
european
spot
and
power
trading
market
according
to
the
norwegian
grid
in
that
case
the
uk
will
be
treated
in
the
same
way
as
switzerland
statnett
told
norway
s
nve
power
regulator
in
a
letter
reviewed
by
reuters
brexit
could
also
mean
that
britain
will
no
longer
be
bound
by
eu
competition
rules
which
currently
allow
interconnectors
to
seek
british
subsidy
payments
for
providing
supply
capacity
there
is
therefore
a
risk
that
british
authorities
exclude
international
connections
from
participation
in
the
capacity
market
or
significantly
reduce
the
value
of
participation
statnett
said
we
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
risk
that
british
authorities
may
introduce
a
border
tariff
it
added
northconnect
has
been
at
the
centre
of
a
political
row
in
norway
with
opposition
parties
and
some
trade
unions
opposing
the
second
cable
over
fears
of
rising
power
prices
statnett
also
said
that
plans
to
build
northconnect
by
were
unrealistic
given
the
time
needed
to
manufacture
and
install
the
cable
odd
oeygarden
chairman
of
the
northconnect
owners
group
said
brexit
made
the
situation
unclear
to
some
extent
but
pointed
out
that
statnett
was
already
building
a
cable
and
that
there
are
more
links
from
the
european
mainland
in
place
i
think
in
the
long
run
the
uk
and
the
eu
will
find
the
solutions
that
would
allow
the
interconnectors
to
operate
