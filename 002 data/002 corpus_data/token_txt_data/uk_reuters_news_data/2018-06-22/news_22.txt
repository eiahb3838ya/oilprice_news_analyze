venezuelan
security
forces
suspected
of
killing
hundreds
of

is
virtually
absent

and
said
it
was
sending
its
report
to
the
international
criminal
court
icc
whose
prosecutor
opened
a
preliminary
investigation
in
february
the
report
cited
credible
shocking
accounts
of
extrajudicial
killings
of
young
men
during
operations
in
poor
neighbourhoods
conducted
without
arrest
warrants
security
forces
would
tamper
with
the
scene
so
that
there
appeared
to
have
been
an
exchange
of
fire
it
said
there
was
no
immediate
response
from
the
government
of
president
nicolas
maduro
to
the
report
critics
say
maduro
has
used
increasingly
authoritarian
tactics
as
the
opec
nation
s
economy
has
spiralled
deeper
into
recession
and
hyperinflation
fuelling
discontent
and
prompting
hundreds
of
thousands
to

says
the
opposition
protests
were
aimed
at
overthrowing
him
and
accuses
the
united
states
of
directing
an
economic
war
against
venezuela
the
failure
to
hold
security
forces
accountable
for
such
serious
human
rights
violations
suggests
that
the
rule
of

is
virtually
absent
in

cast
the

peace
gesture
following
his

a
new

as
an
undemocratic
farce
