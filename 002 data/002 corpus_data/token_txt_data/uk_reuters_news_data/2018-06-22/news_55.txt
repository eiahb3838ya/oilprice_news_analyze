the

major
sinopec
the
result
of
a
government
drive
to
develop
domestic
technology
to
tap
the
country
s
vast
shale
gas
resources
buried
in
the
region
s
mountainous
terrain
it
is
the
latest
key
technology
that
china
has
learned
to
master
except
for
a
handful
of
tools
sinopec
and
a
crop
of
independent
companies
make
everything
from
trucks
and
pumps
to

proppants

to

we

ourselves
the
amount
of
work
handled
by
foreign
firms
is
minimal
said
shi

a
senior
sinopec
service
engineer
the
push
motivated
in
part
by
cost
cutting
amid
the
oil
price
slump
of
has
seen
international
firms
like
oil
services
group
schlumberger
halliburton
or
baker
hughes
scale
back
operations
in
china
meanwhile
chinese
firms
are
starting
to
export
equipment
including
pressure
pumps
even
to
the
home
of
the
shale
boom
in
the
united
states
over
the
past
years
the
cost
of
building
a
well
has
nearly
halved
to
an
average
of
under
million
yuan
per
well
million
and
drilling
speed
has
improved
by
to
days
according
to
interviews
with
state
oil
officials
equipment
makers
and
service
providers
china
has
over
the
years
developed
its
unique
practice
that
employs
compact
drilling
equipment
to
suit
the
terrains
and
improved
greatly
on
drilling
efficiency

state
energy
giants
sinopec
and
petrochina
pumped
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
of
shale
gas
in
up
from
scratch
a
decade
ago
and
equivalent
to
about
percent
of
the
country
s
total
natural
gas
production
still
the
hilltop
scene
illustrates
some
of
the
problems
facing
the
world
s
biggest
energy
consumer
in
exploiting
its
unconventional
gas
unlike
the
flatter
regions
containing
shale
chinese
firms
operate
in
tricky
environments
including
mountainous
arid
remote
and
also
highly
populated
regions
leading
to
higher
costs
china
s
shale
is
also
buried
deeper
and
is
more
fractured
making
it
difficult
and
expensive
to
extract
china
is
expected
to
nearly
double
output
to
bcm
by
according
to
wood
mackenzie
while
below
beijing
s
target
of
bcm
set
out
four
years
ago
and
just
a
fraction
of
bcm
produced
in
the
united
states
last
year
domestic
gas
is
a
major
focus
as
the
country
looks
to
ease
its
reliance
on
dirtier
coal
china
s
leading
manufacturer
of
fracking
equipment
is
jianghan
machinery
plant
which
accounts
for
more
than
half
of
the
country
s
production
of
fracking
trucks
and
pumps
the
firm
under
the
supervision
of
what
was
then
the
ministry
of
petroleum
bought
several
dozen
fracking
trucks
in
on
condition
the
manufacturer
allowed
access
to
its
technology
said
a
jianghan
marketing
executive
who
declined
to
be
named
as
he
was
not
authorized
to
speak
to
media
the
was
initially
applied
to
conventional
wells
before
jianghan
now
part
of
sinopec
china
s
top
shale
gas
firm
built
the
country
s
first
shale
fracker
in
baoji
machinery
a
unit
of
cnpc
and
independent
equipment
builders
honghua
group
and
jereh
group
have
also
expanded
into
shale
and
are
competing
in
new
more
efficient
frackers
jereh
and
honghua
are
also
leading
an
export
push
said
company
officials
competing
with
the
likes
of
halliburton
jereh
exports
trucks
pressure
pumps
and
pipes
with
total
overseas
sales
making
up
half
of
its
billion
yuan
million
in
revenue
in
a
company
spokeswoman
said
declining
to
give
a
breakdown
by
country
lucrative
export
contracts
will
be
needed
as
china
s
shale
industry
still
struggles
to
make
cash
at
home
sinopec
has
acknowledged
it
would
be
difficult
to
break
even
without
government
subsidies
currently
at
roughly
percent
of
prices
helping
increase
efficiency
chinese
firms
can
now
drill
multiple
wells
at
a
single
pad
known
as
well
factory
drilling
they
can
also
carry
out
extended
horizontal
fracturing
up
to
metres
sinopec
engineers
said
the
expertise
will
be
needed
if
china
is
to
make
the
most
of
its
shale
gas
estimated
by
the
energy
information
administration
as
the
world
s
largest
western
majors
like
exxon
mobil
royal
dutch
shell
total
conocophillips
and
chevron
largely
abandoned
china
s
shale
scene
after
disappointing
initial
results
geologists
at
sinopec
said
they
have
struggled
to
replicate
a
find
like
fuling
the
largest
commercial
field
a
gas
field
similar
but
smaller
to
the
hugely
successful
marcellus
formation
there
are
also
complaints
that
sinopec
s
and
petrochina
s
domination
is
a
barrier
to
future
development
as
these
state
behemoths
hinder
competition
only
in
late
as
shale
drilling
quickened
on
the
back
of
rising
oil
prices
did
the
two
majors
start
awarding
service
contracts
to
independent
