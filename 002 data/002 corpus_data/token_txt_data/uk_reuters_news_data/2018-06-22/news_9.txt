big oil eyes u.s. minority groups to build offshore drilling support
washington
reuters
the
largest
oil
and
gas
lobby
group
is
seeking
to
convince
hispanic
and
black
communities
to
support
the
trump
administration
s
proposed
expansion
of
offshore
drilling
arguing
it
would
create
high
paying
jobs
including
for
puerto
ricans
the
american
petroleum
institute
api
launched
its
explore
offshore
campaign
earlier
this
month
to
counter
offshore
drilling
foes
in
coastal
southeast
states
from
virginia
to
florida
where
lawmakers
and
governors
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
have
expressed
fear
an
oil
spill
could
ruin
tourism
we
want
to
build
support
in
minority
communities
because
the
message
that
increasing
the
supply
of
affordable
energy
and
good
paying
jobs
will
resonate

the
interior
department
in
january
announced
a
proposal
to
open
up
nearly
all
offshore
waters
to
drilling
triggering
a
backlash
from
coastal
states
that
rely
on
tourism
interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
told
a
senate
panel
in
april
that
he
is
likely
to
scale
back
the
proposal
following
meetings
with
coastal
governors
shortly
after
he
unveiled
his
offshore
drilling
proposal
zinke
offered
an
exemption
for
florida
after
he
held
a
private
meeting
with
republican
governor
rick

the

keen
to
pursue
seismic

the
api
campaign
published
in
local
newspapers
this
week
including
one
by
stephen
gilchrist
chair
of
south
carolina
s
african
american
chamber
of
commerce
in
it
he
touts
api
s
major
talking
point
that
oil
and
gas
exploration
jobs
offer
locals
an
average
salary
of
without
requiring
a
college
degree
it
s
a
myth
that
communities
of
color
are
not
interested
in
supporting
offshore
exploration
he
wrote
in
south
carolina
s
post
and
courier
i
ve
personally
attended
town
hall
meetings
up
and
down
south
carolina
s
coast
where
there
has
been
significant
support
for
the
economic
opportunity
offshore
exploration
holds
especially
in
communities
that
have
been
historically
api
however
acknowledged
it
needs
to
hold
community
meetings
and
improve
local
outreach
to
sway
minority
communities
that
have
been
inclined
to
oppose
offshore
drilling
miriam
ramirez
a
of
the
api
s
florida
campaign
and
a
former
puerto
rico
state
senator
said
she
thinks
the
lure
of
jobs
especially
for
victims
of
s
hurricane
maria
would
create
economic
opportunities
that
outweigh
environmental
concerns
we
have
an
influx
of
thousands
of
puerto
ricans
in
florida
including
doctors
and
engineers
who
plan
to
relocate
permanently
ramirez
said
a
study
released
in
march
by
oceana
an
ocean
conservancy
group
found
interior
s
offshore
drilling
plan
would
put
more
than
million
jobs
and
nearly
billion
in
gross
domestic
product
at
risk
for
only
two
year
of
oil
and
just
over
one
year
of
gas
at
current
consumption
jobs
that
come
from
offshore
drilling
do
not
guarantee
local
good
paying
jobs
compared
to
the
tourism
industry
which
can
keep
jobs

and

of
the
national
caucus
of
environmental
legislators
julio
fuentes
president
of
florida
s
hispanic
chamber
of
commerce
said
he
is
reaching
out
to
new
puerto
rican
evacuees
as
well
as
existing
local
communities
that
are
skeptical
of
offshore
drilling
by
hosting
roundtables
with
business
leaders
and
community
organizations
i
always
like
to
talk
about
the
safety
aspect
of
it
fuentes
said
since
the
bp
oil
spill
there
have
been
over
new
industry
standards
put
in
place
he
said
referring
to
the
devastating

oil
spill
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
that
caused
tremendous
damage
to
beaches
and
coastlines
in
gulf
coast
states
but
environmental
justice
advocates
counter
that
there
is
no
way
to
guarantee
safe
offshore
drilling
marce
president

group
azul
said
it
takes
only
one
spill
or
accident
to
deprive
hispanic
communities
access
to
the
shore
which
she
argues
is
an
important
form
of
escape
from
the
stress
of
urban
