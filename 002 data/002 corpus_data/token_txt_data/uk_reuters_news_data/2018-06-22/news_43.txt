opec
will
seek
agreement
on
friday
to
raise
oil
production
despite
opposition
from
iran
which
has
threatened
to
block
the
move
as
it
faces
sanctions
opec
s
de
facto
leader
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
said
a
production
increase
of
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
or
around
percent
of
global
supply
had
become
a
proposal
for
the
group
and
its
allies
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
will
be
gathering
in
vienna
amid
calls
from
top
consumers
the
united
states
china
and
india
to
cool
down
the
price
of
crude
and
prevent
an
oil
shortage
that
would
hurt
the
global
economy
it
will
be
a
hard
meeting
today
i
wouldn
t
say
all
will
accept
the
million
bpd
proposed
an
opec
delegate
said
adding
the
group
could
agree
on
a
lower
figure
iran
opec
s
producer
has
so
far
been
the
main
barrier
to
a
deal
as
it
called
on
opec
to
reject
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
pump
more
oil
trump
imposed
fresh
sanctions
on
tehran
in
may
and
market
watchers
expect
iran
s
output
to
drop
by
a
third
by
the
end
of
that
means
the
country
has
little
to
gain
from
a
deal
to
raise
opec
output
unlike
saudi
arabia
i
don
t
think
we
can
reach
agreement
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
on
thursday
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
the
overwhelming
majority
of
producers
had
recommended
raising
output
by
million
bpd
gradually
and
on
a
basis
opec
and
its
allies
have
since
last
year
been
participating
in
a
pact
to
cut
output
by
million
bpd
the
measure
has
helped
rebalance
the
market
in
the
past
months
and
lifted
oil
to
around
per
barrel
from
as
low
as
in
but
unexpected
outages
in
venezuela
libya
and
angola
have
effectively
brought
supply
cuts
to
around
million
bpd
in
recent
months
brent
oil
prices
were
up
percent
on
friday
falih
has
warned
the
world
could
face
a
supply
deficit
of
up
to
million
bpd
in
the
second
half
of
and
that
opec
s
responsibility
was
to
address
consumers
worries
we
want
to
prevent
the
shortage
and
the
squeeze
that
we
saw
in
falih
said
referring
to
a
time
when
oil
rallied
close
to
per
barrel
earlier
this
week
zanganeh
left
the
door
open
for
a
deal
saying
opec
members
that
had
overdelivered
on
cuts
in
recent
months
should
comply
with
agreed
quotas
that
would
effectively
mean
a
modest
boost
from
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
that
have
voluntarily
cut
more
deeply
than
planned
zanganeh
has
said
that
if
opec
returned
to
regular
compliance
the
group
would
raise
output
by
around
bpd
falih
also
said
the
real
increase
would
be
smaller
than
the
nominal
gain
of
million
bpd
meaning
a
compromise
with
iran
remained
possible
opec
sources
also
said
iran
had
demanded
that
sanctions
be
mentioned
in
the
group
s
communique
as
tehran
has
blamed
measures
for
the
recent
rise
in
oil
prices
the
united
states
which
rivals
russia
and
saudi
arabia
for
the
position
of
world
oil
producer
is
not
participating
in
the
current
supply
pact

possible
scenarios
