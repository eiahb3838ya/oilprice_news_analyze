is
looking

revive
a
rupee
trade
mechanism

settle

to
pay
tehran
might
choke
under
pressure
from
sanctions
two
government
sources
said
during
a
previous
round
of
sanctions
india
devised
a
scheme
acceptable
to
washington
to
allow
it
to
make
some
oil
payments
to
tehran
in
rupees
through
a
small
state
bank
iran
used
the

looking
at
reviving
rupee
mechanism
we
have
to
prepare
ourselves

to
decide

president
donald
trump
withdrew
from
a
nuclear
accord
with
iran

ordered
the
reimposition
of
sanctions
some
sanctions
take
effect
from
while
those
notably
affecting
the
oil
sector
will
be
effective
from

to
the

refiners
and
the

say
it
would
not
be
able
to
handle
oil
payments
to
iran
from
nov
an
official
at
sbi
said
india
refiners
receive
a
credit
period
for
payments
to
iran
suggesting
oil
imports
from
iran
could
be
hit
from
august
the
indian
government
has
not
asked
its
refiners
to
cut
iranian
oil
imports
but
some
firms
have
started
reducing
purchases
from
tehran
so
far
we
don
t
know
what
we
are
expected
to
do
we
have
not
asked
refiners
to
cut
imports

the

to
find
alternative
payment
routes
the

adding
it
had
found
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
use
european
banks
for
payment
to
restarting
the
rupee
payment
mechanism
would
help
fix
a
trade
balance
tilted
in
favour
of
iran
