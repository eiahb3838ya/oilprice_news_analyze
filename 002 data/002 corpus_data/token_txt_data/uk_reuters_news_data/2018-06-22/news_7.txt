who
was
at
the
helm
when
it
emerged
the
carmaker
had
cheated
on
emissions
tests
supervisory
board
member
stephan
weil
told
a
newspaper
damages

former
management
board
members
are
under
serious
consideration
i
m
not
just
saying

in
an
interview
when

whether
volkswagen
vw
would
seek
damages
from

once
we
know
the

of

we
will
make
a
decision
said

represents
the
german
state
of
lower
saxony
a
vw
shareholder
on
the
company
s
board
vw
has
for
years
said
only
managers
knew
of
the
emissions
cheating
but
authorities
filed
criminal
charges
against
winterkorn
earlier
this
year
this
month
munich
prosecutors
widened
their
probe
into
vw
s
premium
brand
audi
they
said
they
were
investigating
audi
chief
executive
rupert
stadler
for
suspected
fraud
and
false
advertising
and
for
his
alleged
role
in
helping
to
bring
cars
equipped
with
illegal
software
on
to
the
european
market
this
week
they
arrested
stadler
citing
concerns
he
might
try
to
interfere
with
the
investigation
the
arrest
prompted
the
supervisory
board
to
suspend
him
and
name
bram
schot
to
take
over
as
interim
audi
ceo
asked
by
sueddeutsche
why
stadler
was
suspended
rather
than
removed
entirely
weil
said
many
questions
remained
unanswered
it
is
a
matter
of
fairness
to
wait
until
the
matter
is
cleared
up
any
normal
employer
would
do
that
he
said
adding
he
could
not
predict
whether
stadler
would
return
to
his
post
stadler
remains
remanded
in
custody
but
has
not
been
charged
with
a
crime
vw
and
audi
have
said
that
stadler
should
be
presumed
innocent
unless
proven
otherwise
