of
additions
this

smaller

production
according
to

executives
the
rig
count
an
early
indicator
of
future
output
is
much
higher
than
a
year
ago
when
rigs
were
active
as
energy
companies
have
been
ramping
up
production
in
tandem
with
opec
s
past
efforts
to
cut
global

to
take
advantage

jumped
by
the
most
since
november

after
opec
and
its
allies
led
by
russia
agreed
to
increase
production
by
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
so
far
this
year
oil
futures
have
averaged
per
barrel
that
compares
with
averages
of
in
and
in
looking
ahead
crude
futures
were
trading
near

in
the
same
as
last
week
since
oil
and
gas
rigs
were
currently
in

drillers
would
only
have
to
add
a
handful
of
rigs
for
the
rest
of
the
year
to
hit
simmons
forecast
for
so
far
this
year
the
total
number
of
oil
and
gas
rigs
active
in
the
united
states
has
averaged
that
keeps
the

count
for
on
track
to
be
the
highest
since
which
