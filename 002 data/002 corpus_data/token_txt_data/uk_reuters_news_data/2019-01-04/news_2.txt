shutdown risks delays to u.s. drilling, ethanol, wind initiatives
york
reuters
the
partial
government
shutdown
is
increasing
the
chances
of
delays
in
energy
initiatives
from
the
release
of
president
donald
trump
s
proposed
offshore
drilling
plan
to
allowing
higher
levels
of
ethanol
in
gasoline
during
summer
months
energy
industry
groups
said
on
friday
the
department
of
interior
had
been
expected
to
release
its
highly
anticipated
to
offshore
oil
and
gas
drilling
plan
in
early
january
the
trump
administration
has
made
opening
up
greater
areas
to
offshore
drilling
and
holding
more
frequent
lease
sales
part
of
its
energy
dominance
agenda
to
boost
fossil
fuel
output
for
both
domestic
use
and
exports
industry
interest
in
several
lease
sales
has
been
tepid
but
the
administration
has
said
more
interest
is
expected
in
the
future
the
interior
department
is
operating
at
reduced
staffing
levels
due
to
the
partial
shutdown
which
has
stretched
two
weeks
nicolette
nye
a
spokeswoman
at
the
national
ocean
industries
association
said
her
group
is
expecting
the
shutdown
will
lead
to
a
delay
in
the
proposed
plan
s
release
but
she
said
members
of
her
group
should
not
be
overly
affected
as
long
as
the
final
drilling
plan
expected
to
be
released
this
summer
comes
on
time
it
s
always
a
good
thing
to
have
something
in
place
that
they
can
use
to
plan
on
but
it
s
more
important
to
have
the
final
plan
on
schedule
for
our
companies
nye
said
the
interior
department
did
not
comment
on
a
potential
delay
due
to
the
lapse
in
appropriations
the
department
is
unable
to
respond
to
inquiries
unrelated
to
shutdown

said
in
an

in
response

a

on
the
drilling
proposal
timeline
biofuel

are
worried
the
shutdown
could
lead
to
delays
in
environmental
protection
agency
epa
rules
that
would
allow
sales
in
summer
of
gasoline
containing
up
to
percent
ethanol
called
agricultural
interests
have
lobbied
for
the
sales
after
the
trump
administration
gave
breaks
on
ethanol
requirements
to
some
oil
refiners
from
the
outset
the
epa
gave
itself
very
little
wiggle
room
to
complete
the
rulemaking
before
summer
so
the
shutdown
is
making
a
tight
timeline
even
tighter

said
in
a
release
still
cooper
said
we
he
was
confident
the
epa
will
allow
sales
before
june
when
asked
about
the
potential
for
delays
an
epa
spokeswoman
said
the
agency
will
only
be
responding
to
queries
directly
related
to
the
government
shutdown
or
to
environmental
emergencies
this
week
the
bureau
of
ocean
energy
management
an
office
of
the
interior
department
warned
that
public
meetings
related
to
what
is
slated
to
be
the
largest
offshore
wind
farm
will
be
rescheduled
if
the
shutdown
continues
into
next
week
the
five
meetings
are
meant
to
allow
the
public
to
comment
on
the
megawatt
project
s
environmental
impacts
and
are
currently
scheduled
to
take
place
in
massachusetts
and
rhode
island
between
and
the
project
is
being
developed
by
avangrid
inc
and
copenhagen
infrastructure
partners
the
trump
administration
has
said
development
of
a
domestic
offshore
wind
industry
is
critical
to
its
energy
strategy
the
department
of
energy
and
its
independent
office
the
federal
energy
regulatory
committee
are
both
already
funded
for
so
the
shutdown
has
minimal
effect
on
their
programs
