markets
were
on
edge
on
friday
as
dire
economic
data
slammed
wall
street
and
pushed
investors
to
bet
the
federal

could
reverse
its
policy
tightening
before
the

of
this
year

some
basis
this

to
the
safety

yields
on
the
treasuries
sank
below
percent
to
reach
parity
with
the
federal

effective

for
the
first
time
since

yields
were
even
lower
an
inversion
that

sometimes
heralded
recessions
in
the
past
yields
on

paper
dropped
to
percent
a
staggering
turnaround
from
the
highs
of
percent
seen
as
recently
as
november
the

kept
the
dollar
on
the
defensive
the
greenback
plumbed
a
more
than
low
of

the
yen
on
thursday
driven
by
technical
factors
amid

it
has
fallen
more
than

more
than
five

a
drop
of
this

has
only
been
seen
four
times
since

which
the

was
in
the
midst
of

said
michelle
girard
economist
at
rbs
the
ism
has
a
long

big

often
prove
to
be

the

therefore
gives
pause
even
to

economic
optimists
girard
added
now
a
indicator
is
flashing
yellow
putting

likely
the
federal

a
total
six
times

galloped
ahead

showed
signs
of
picking
up
investors
had
initially
expected
the
policy
tightening
to
continue
through
this

but
the
ongoing
trade
war
and
recent
disappointing

have
put
those
expectations

investors
now
see
