rallied
on
friday
after
beijing
announced
a

with

though
recession
fears
still
had

news
that
the
united
states
and
china
would
hold

talks
on
monday
and
tuesday
to
resolve
a

some
respite
to
battered

with

up
a

around

edward

of
valuations
if
you
look
at
the
two
core
risks
trade
and
the
fed
there
s
room
for
markets
to
be
positively
surprised
in
both
of
those
global
markets
have
had
a
rough
start
to
hurt
by
a
shock
revenue
warning
from
iphone
maker
apple
and
concerns
about
slowing
global
economic
growth

of

weighed
by
growth
worries
and
the
strength
of
the
yen
the
yen
edged
back
from
its
recent
surge
on
friday
on
hopes
trade
talks
would
make
some
progress
but
the
japanese
currency
remains
well
bid
by
investors
fretting
about
a
global
economic
slowdown
the
yen
fell
as
much
as
percent
against
the
dollar
to
before
recovering
some
of
those
losses
to
trade
at
the
euro

the

hurt
the
improving
tone
also
fed
through

europe
s
bond
markets
pushing
yields
on
safe

assets
such
as
germany
s

off

hit
this
week
but
analysts
are
unconvinced
that
the
trade
talks
and
subsequent
relief
rally
signal
sustained
improvements
particularly
in
a
new
era
of
tightening
liquidity
central
banks
are
trying
to
get
markets
weaned
off
the
idea
that
they
will
come
riding
to
the
rescue
and
people
are
trying
to
learn
what
the
new
rules
of
the
game
are
said
colin
harte
head
of
research
multi
asset
solutions
at
bnp
paribas
asset
management
harte
added
that
he
was
sceptical
that
the
talks
would
have
a
meaningful
resolution
the
picture
will
remain
unclear
for
the
first
half
of
this
year
he
said
german
bond
yields
while
higher
on
friday
were
set
for
their
biggest
weekly
fall
since
october
down
around
basis
points
the
move
is
evidence
of
a
key
change
in
central
bank
rate
expectations
bob
michele
chief
investment
officer
and
head
of
fixed
income
at
jp
morgan
asset
management
said
with
rate
cut
expectations
and
a
in
the
does
it
look
realistic
that
the
ecb
will
raise
rates
at
all
this
year
he
added
in
such
a
risk
michele
said
it
was
not
inconceivable
that
the
european
central
bank
would
return
to
quantitative
easing
which
would
push
bond
yields
even
lower
money
markets
price
just
a
percent
chance
of
a
basis
point
ecb
rate
hike
in
the
risk
of
a
economic
downturn
or
even
a
recession
has
caused
a
tectonic
shift
in
expectations
for
interest
rates
with
investors
now
pricing
in
the
possibility
of
a
cut
investors
will
be
looking
for
any
clues
from
federal
reserve
chair
jerome
powell
who
is
due
to
speak
on
friday
as
well
as
the
latest
jobs
numbers
released
later
this
session
while
the
fed
is
still
projecting
two
more
hikes
this
year
the
futures
market
implies
the
next
move
will
be
down
with
around
a
percent
probability
of
a
move
by
year
end
the
market
is
fully
pricing
in
an
easing
to
percent
by
may
next
year
from
the
current
range
of
percent
the
mounting
speculation
sent
yields
on
treasuries
as
low
as
percent
taking
them
under
the
effective
federal
funds
rate
for
the
first
time
since
they
were
last
trading
at
percent
and
yields
were
even
lower
an
inversion
that
has
sometimes
heralded
recessions
in
the
past
yields
on
benchmark
paper
dropped
to
percent
overnight
a
staggering
turnaround
from
the
highs
of
percent
seen
as
recently
as
november
elsewhere
the
news
of
the
trade
talks
boosted
oil
prices
with
brent
crude
oil
was
percent
higher
at
dollars
