her
farm
in
eastern
kenya
grace
kaari
hums
to
herself
as
she
slices
out
weeds
with
a
blunt
machete
two
years
ago
kaari
would
not
have
had
time
to
tend
her
crop
in
the
morning
instead
she
would
have
been
traveling
to
gather
water
at
a
river
kilometres
miles
away
i
used
to
spend
the
whole
day
fetching
water
i
could
not
do
anything
else
for
the
day
because
of
tiredness
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
but
a
recently
installed
water
pump
has
now
brought
the
precious
resource
direct
to
her
village
and
with
the
village
water
storage
tanks
full
she
has
time
for
the
endless
other
tasks
on
her
piece
of
land
she
said
access
to
clean
water
remains
a
struggle
for
many
of
rural
kenya
s
poorest
households
with
families
blaming
the
problem
on
everything
from
a
lack
of
infrastructure
to
a
lack
of
government
commitment
to
help
the
country
s
most
marginalised
but
some
counties
such
as
kaari
s
tharaka
nithi
where
rural
electrification
is
widely
lacking
now
are
tapping
solar
energy
to
pump
water
to
villages
from
nearby
rivers
the
water
is
then
directed
into
village
storage
tanks
where
household
members
can
fetch
it
free
of
charge
people
have
been
struggling
with
water
scarcity
yet
this
county
has
three
permanent
rivers
the
challenge
was
to
tap
water
from
the
sources
and
bring
it
near
homes
said
jasper
nkanya
the
county
s
executive
commissioner
for
agriculture
water
irrigation
and
fisheries
nkanya
said
the
county
has
plenty
of
sunshine
a
resource
that
went
untapped
for
years
though
that
is
now
changing
the
solar
units
are
able
to
absorb
energy
which
can
be
used
to
pump
water
during
the
day
and
at
night
using
a
a
battery
system
he
said
in
an
interview
established
at
a
cost
of
million
kenya
shillings
the
solar
pump
project
which
serves
over
people
is
funded
by
the
county
government
nkanya
said
residents
say
easier
access
to
water
has
made
a
difference
in
their
lives
particularly
those
of
women
and
girls
who
are
traditionally
charged
with
gathering
water
my
daughter
used
to
miss
school
as
she
accompanied
her
mother
to
fetch
water
said
martin
mwiti
a
motorbike
taxi
operator
in
marimanti
now
her
performance
has
improved
because
she
is
always
at
school
he
said
nkanya
said
the
government
hopes
to
expand
the
project
to
other
parts
of
the
the
county
that
face
similar
water
security
problems
once
more
funds
are
available
another
kenyan
counties
also
are
seeing
solar
power
put
in
place
to
boost
development
including
access
to
water
as
part
of
a
world
effort
said
joseph
njoroge
the
energy
ministry
s
principal
secretary
the
aim
is
to
use
solar
energy
to
bring
development
in
marginalised
parts
of
kenya
including
access
to
water
lighting
and
heating
njoroge
said
of
the
million
project
launched
in
mbeo
ogeya
an
african
research
fellow
at
the
stockholm
environment
institute
said
the
use
of
solar
power
to
fuel
water
pumping
and
irrigation
can
be
a
game
changer
in
energy
and
food
security
for
marginalised
parts
of
kenya
in
marimanti
the
impact
of
access
to
water
is
already
becoming
visible
modern
homes
are
gradually
replacing
huts
in
the
area
long
one
of
the
poorest
in
kenya
as
easier
access
to
water
spurs
new
businesses
in
part
by
freeing
women
s
time
health
centers
now
have
enough
stored
water
to
ensure
good
hygiene
while
babies
are
delivered
while
children
no
longer
have
to
spend
lesson
time
at
school
fetching
water
said
john
kibaara
a
marimanti
resident
njoroge
of
the
energy
ministry
sees
much
more
use
of
solar
power
ahead
for
kenya
we
are
looking
at
the
potential
we
have
looking
ahead
and
counting
on
renewable
energy
to
supply
our
energy
needs
this
is
will
reduce
energy
costs
and
spur
the
growth
of
micro
and
medium
enterprises
especially
in
rural
areas
