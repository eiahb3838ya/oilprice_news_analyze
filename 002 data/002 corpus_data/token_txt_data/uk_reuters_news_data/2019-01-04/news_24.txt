however
there
are
less

left
in

and
recent

suggests
the
standoff
is
taking

hurting

than

concerns
about
a

overnight
the

lost
percent
and
the

percent
for
fed
the
risk
of
a
economic
downturn
or
even
a
recession
has
caused
a
tectonic
shift
in
expectations
for
interest
rates
with
investors
now
pricing
in
the
possibility
of
a
cut
while
the
fed
is
still
projecting
two
more
hikes
this

market
implies
the

be

is
fully
pricing
in
an
easing

from
the
current
range
of

the
mounting
speculation
sent
yields
on
treasuries
as

as
percent

them
under
the
effective
federal

rate
for
the
first
time
since
they
were
last
trading
at
percent
and
yields
were
even
lower
an
inversion
that
has
sometimes
heralded
recessions
in
the
past
yields
on
benchmark
paper
dropped
to
percent
overnight
a
staggering
turnaround
from
the
highs
of
percent
seen
as
recently
as
november
the
decline
has
been
a
drag
on
the
dollar
especially
against
the
yen
the
greenback
plumbed
a
more
than
low
of

the
yen
on
thursday
driven
partly
by
technical
factors
it
had
bounced

friday
but
was
still

was
a
shade
firmer
