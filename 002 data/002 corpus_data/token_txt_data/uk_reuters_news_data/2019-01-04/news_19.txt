ongoing
efforts
to
reach
victims
of
a
mining
disaster
in
northeastern
india
have
exposed
what
campaigners
say
is
poor
enforcement
against
such
illegal
mines
where
undocumented
workers
risk
injury
or
death
at
least
people
were
trapped
when
an
illegal
coal
mine
in
meghalaya
state
flooded
on
rescue
efforts
continue
although
relatives
said
this
week
they
had
lost
hope
that
the
miners
were
still
alive
environmental
concerns
have
led
to
india
imposing
bans
on
the
mining
of
coal
mica
and
sand
among
other
minerals
yet
workers
across
the
country
continue
to
put
themselves
at
risk
as
illegal
mining
continues
a
ban
does
not
mean
you
close
your
eyes
to
mining
it
means
you
physically
protect
natural
resources
in
some
way
said
sumaira
abdulali
founder
of
the
environmental
advocacy
group
awaaz
foundation
but
we
never
set
systems
in
place
we
would
prefer
for
things
to
remain
the
most
recent
disaster
highlighted
the
dangers
of
mines
where
workers
crawl
into
narrow
shafts
on
bamboo
ladders
to
extract
coal
in
meghalaya
campaigners
estimate
that
mines
continue
to
function
despite
a
ban
imposed
in
by
india
s
environmental
court
the
national
green
tribunal
ngt
india
s
courts
have
ordered
bans
on
mining
various
minerals
but
it
is
up
to
state
authorities
to
enforce
them
according
to
niranjan
kumar
singh
a
joint
secretary
in
the
mining
ministry
the
role
of
states
has
become
important
as
the
centre
s
role
is
in
policy
making
he
said
by
phone
we
do
not
have
the
machinery
to
monitor
or
but
teining
dkhar
commissioner
of
meghalaya
s
mining
and
geology
department
said
his
state
has
no
regulatory
mechanism
to
enforce
bans
on
illegal
mining
only
when
we
give
a
licence
for
mining
we
ensure
that
all
environmental
and
labour
laws
are
followed
he
said
by
phone
on
friday
illegal
mining
tends
to
attract
workers
from
around
india
and
neighbouring
countries
who
are
lured
by
the
promise
of
relatively
high
wages
but
are
faced
with
dangerous
conditions
once
they
arrive
workers
in
the
coal
mines
are
promised
about
rupees
per
day
more
than
times
the
average
indian
daily
wage
said
angela
rangad
of
thma
u
war
of
the
oppressed
a
collective
of
democracy
and
human
rights
groups
they
think
they
will
work
a
few
days
and
return
but
they
are
never
paid
on
time
and
remain
trapped
as
they
keep
waiting
for
their
wages
said
rangad
other
workers
including
children
are
trafficked
when
the
charity
impulse
ngo
network
surveyed
mines
in
meghalaya
between
and
it
found
children
many
of
whom
were
trafficked
from
nepal
and
bangladesh
india
is
one
of
the
world
s
most
dangerous
countries
to
be
a
coal
miner
with
one
miner
dying
every
six
days
on
average
in
according
to
government
data
the
number
is
likely
even
larger
as
deaths
in
illegal
mines
are
common
but
often
go
unreported
according
to
campaigners
a
thomson
reuters
foundation
investigation
in
maharashtra
state
found
that
workers
were
drowning
as
they
illegally
extracted
sand
from
the
bottom
of
a
creek
near
mumbai
india
s
commercial
capital
the
deaths
were
not
reported
and
employers
paid
only
a
few
families
a
small
amount
of
money
in
response
to
the
revelations
the
maharashtra
state
government
promised
to
end
illegal
mining
along
the
creek
impose
regulations
and
provide
alternate
jobs
but
a
year
later
sand
mining
was
continuing
and
most
of
those
promises
remained
unfulfilled
campaigners
said
state
governments
need
to
draw
up
protocols
on
how
to
monitor
and
enforce
bans
against
illegal
mining
while
the
central
government
must
follow
up
as
well
if
the
state
fails
to
take
action
the
centre
should
intervene
to
check
the
negligence
and
apathy
said
hasina
kharbhih
founder
of
the
impulse
ngo
network
whose
petition
against
mines
led
the
ngt
to
ban
them
in
meghalaya
