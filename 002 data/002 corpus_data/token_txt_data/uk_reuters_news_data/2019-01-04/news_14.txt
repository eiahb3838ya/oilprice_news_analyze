the
dollar
has
recently
appreciated
to
its
highest
level
in
real
terms
since
the
start
of
and
before
that
september
dollar
appreciation
weighed
on
oil
prices
in
as
prices
in
some
currencies
hit
record
levels
earlier
in
the
year
and
dampened
consumption
growth
yet
there
are
signs
that
the
dollar
s
rise
may
be
coming
to
an
end
as
trade
tensions
with
china
weigh
and
pressure
to
raise
rates
dissipates
lifting
prospects
for
oil
prices
to
recover
for
now
dollar
strength
has
helped
hold
down
inflation
even
as
unemployment
has
fallen
to
its
lowest
level
in
decades
but
it
has
contributed
to
a
worsening
trade
deficit
and
cut
the
dollar
value
of
overseas

of

the
united
states
is
currently
running
a
mix
of
expansionary
fiscal
policy
tax
cuts
and
increased
spending
on
the
military
and
a
less
accommodative
or
contractionary
financial
policy
rising
interest
rates
the
consequence
is
an
improvement
in
the
between
employment
and
inflation
internal
balance
but
a
deterioration
in
the
trade
deficit
external
balance
exchange
rate
movements
have
suppressed
inflation
despite
the
booming
economy
but
at
the
cost
of
declining
international
competitiveness
despite
tariffs
the
strong
dollar
has
posed
a
dilemma
for
the
federal
reserve
halting
interest
rates
hikes
runs
the
risk
of
pushing
down
the
real
exchange
rate
and
pushing
up
inflation
the
trump
administration
and
the
federal
reserve
are
to
some
extent
the
policy
mix
of
the
reagan
administration
and
the
central
bank
under
paul
volcker
in
the
the
reagan
administration
s
tax
cuts
and
defence
coupled
with
higher
interest
rates
caused
the
dollar
to
surge
and
the
trade
deficit
to
soar
the
reagan
administration
pressed
trading
partners
to
cut
exports
to
the
united
states
especially
cars
steel
and
electronics
and
boost
their
currencies
eventually
the
white
house
pushed
the
fed
to
adopt
a
more
accommodative
policy
triggering
the
departure
of
the
chairman
it
is
worth
noting
the
current
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
was
the
deputy
trade
representative
in
the
reagan
administration
when
it
forced
japan
to
accept
voluntary
export
restraints
to
curb
its
exports
to
the
united
states
the
administration
went
on
to
press
the
other
major
economies
to
appreciate
their
currencies
and
depreciate
the
dollar
as
part
of
the
plaza
accord
in
the
strong
dollar
of
the
early
worsened
the
demand
destruction
and
oversupply
of
oil
in
the
early
and
contributed
to
the
price
crisis
of
and
subsequent
dollar
depreciation
likely
helped
steady
oil
prices
in
the
second
half
of
the
at

it
did
once
saudi

s
oil

ahmed
zaki
yamani
was
replaced
and
the
kingdom
abandoned
netback
pricing
and
its

warfare
strategy
just
as
japan
was
the
target
for
policymakers
in
the
complaining
about
unfair
trading
practices
china
has
become
the
target
in
the
the
experience
of
the
fiscal
expansion
strong
dollar
and
trade
deficits
of
the
hold
important
lessons
for
the
next
two
years
and
a
possible
roadmap
the
trade
war
between
the
united
states
and
china
has
pushed
both
economies
as
well
as
their
trading
partners
towards
a
slowdown
or
even
a
recession
in
as
economic
growth
slows
both
countries
are
likely
to
become
increasingly
eager
for
a
negotiated
solution
that
kickstarts
business
activity
and
raises
equity
prices
the
worse
the
economic
news
becomes
the
greater
the
pressure
on
both
countries
particularly
the
united
states
which
holds
a
presidential
election
in
to
reach
a
deal
lighthizer
s
involvement
suggests
any
eventual
deal
with
china
and
deals
with
the
european
union
and
other
trading
partners
will
likely
employ
some
combination
of
managed
trade
to
reduce
the
deficit
voluntary
export
restraints
purchases
of
big
ticket
items
such
as
aircraft
and
farm
products
together
with
selective
tariffs
and
quotas
are
likely
to
form
part
of
the
eventual
deal
negotiators
will
also
push
for
structural
reforms
on
intellectual
property
subsidies
and
enterprises
probably
even
harder
than
they
did
with
japan
in
the
the
trump
white
house
has
already
made
its
displeasure
with
the
fed
over
recent
interest
rate
increases
very
clear
signs
of
a
domestic
slowdown
will
give
the
central
bank
an
opportunity
to
the
case
for
further
rises
or
even
contemplate
a
cut
if
policymakers
wish
to
do
so
without
more
pressure
from
the
white
house
the
white
house
has
been
vigilant
over
the
strength
of
the
dollar
pressing
other
trading
partners
not
to
depreciate
their
currencies
further
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
administration
will
try
to
repeat
the
plaza
accord
or
include
exchange
rate
conditions
in
any
trade
with
china
even
without
a
formal
exchange
rate
agreement
an
end
to
interest
rate
increases
could
halt
the
currency
s
upward
move
and
interest
rate
cuts
would
probably
send
it
lower
again
as
they
did
between
and
in
the
short
term
lower
oil
prices
have
been
an
important
part
of
global
rebalancing
and
will
support
economic
activity
in
consuming
countries
and
ultimately
buy
back
some
demand
growth
in
but
a
scenario
with
lower
interest
rates
dollar
depreciation
easing
trade
tensions
and
an
improving
global
economic
outlook
could
ultimately
help
push
oil
prices
higher
everything
hinges
on
whether
policymakers
in
the
united
states
and
china
can
find
a
way
to
avoid
further
escalation
of
their
economic
war
and
avert
