could
be
taken
on
more
than
million

said
the
new
capacity
would
bulk
out
the
pipeline
of
gas
set
to
come
on
stream
in
coming
years
adding
to
the
more
than
million

if
you
have
seen
the
potential
demand
for
lng
you
have
seen
costs
where
they
are
now
that
is
motivating
companies
to
push
projects
forward
and
motivating
buyers
to
come
forward
to
support
some
of
these
projects
farrer
said
frontrunners
this
year
include
the
billion
arctic
lng
project
by
russia
s
novatek
at
least
one
project
in
mozambique
and
three
in
the
united
states
woodmac
said
in
a
report
to
its
clients
the
three
potential
projects
are
qatar
petroleum
s
golden
pass
with

and

s
calcasieu

the

said
canada
s
woodfibre
lng
project
developed
by
pacific
oil
and
gas
may
also
get
the
in
woodmac
said
new
projects
typically
take
several
years
to
develop
with
many
of
those
under
consideration
likely
to
be
ready
to
ship
gas
in
the
early
if
approved
a
final
investment
decision
on
golden
pass
is
expected
by
this
month
while
a
decision
on
sabine
pass
is
expected
in
the
first
quarter
and
one
on
calcasieu
pass
is
expected
in
the
first
half
amid
a
plethora
of
potential
new
production
from
russia
australia
east
africa
and
the
united
states
top
exporter
qatar
is
also
expanding
qatar
is
recognizing
that
it
needs
to
capture
demand
for
its
lng
now
so
it
s
bringing
forward
its
projects
farrer
said
now
is
a
good
time
to
invest
if
you
look
at
industry
costs
they
have
really
come
off
a
cliff
from
to
years
ago
so
if
you
re
investing
now
you
re
investing
in
the
bottom
of
the
cost
cycle
said
farrer
other
projects
awaiting
fid
include
train
of
nigeria
lng
and
a
expansion
in
papua
new
guinea
although
some
projects
are
widely
expected
to
be
pushed
into
the
huge
increases
in
china
s
demand
growth
as
part
of
a
programme
to
shift
households
and
factories
from
coal
to
gas
increased
lng
import
dependency
in
europe
and
a
backlash
against
dirtier
coal
is
driving
optimism
in
the
industry
lng
supply
will
already
grow
by
an
estimated
record
million
tonnes
or
percent
this
year
potentially
putting
pressure
on
asian
lng
prices
currently
around
per
million
british
thermal
units
most
of
this
year
s
new
supply
will
come
from
the
united
states
with
new
trains
at
cameron
lng
corpus
christi
lng
elba
island
lng
and
the
freeport
lng
said
edmund
siau
analyst
at
fge
in
terms
of
demand
china
continues
to
post
strong
growth
while
europe
could
also
see
increases
after
years
of
stagnation
growing
by
about
million
tonnes
and
playing
a
key
role
in
absorbing
new
american
supply
siau
said
but
risks
loom
especially
from
the
trade
war
which
threatens
global
growth
which
in
turn
could
pull
down
oil
and
gas
prices
and
delay
or
cancel
