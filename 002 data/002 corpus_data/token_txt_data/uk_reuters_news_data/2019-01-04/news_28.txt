financial
markets
were
on
edge
on
friday
as
weak
economic
data
added
to
fears
of
a
global
slowdown
and
pushed
investors
to
bet
the
federal
reserve
could
reverse
policy
and
start
cutting
interest
rates
before
the
end
of
this
year
but
nerves
were
soothed
somewhat
by
news
that
the
united

and
china
would
hold

analysts
now
expect
the
two
economic
giants
to
find
some
common
ground
in
their
dispute
with
added
impetus
possibly
coming
from
a
run
of
disappointing
data
and
weak
stock
market
on
both
sides
however
there
are
less
than

months
left
in

the
dismal

report
came
after

data
on

showed
its
manufacturing

contracted
in

for
the
first

in

its

this
is
more
proof
if
needed
that
president
donald
trump
s
trade
actions
against
china
are
now
hurting
the
as
much
as
they
are
china
rather
than
being
as
trump
would
have
us
belief
a
zero

game
where

spoils
at
all

expense
said
ray
attrill
head
of

strategy
at

australia
bank
there
is
more
reason
to
think
a
trade
deal
is
in
the
offing
in
coming
the
spectre
of
a
deep
economic
downturn
in
the
united
states
or
even
a
recession
spooked
global
investors
who
flocked
away
from
risky
equities
to
the
safety
of
bonds
investors
had
expected
the
federal
reserve
to
stay
on
its
tightening
path
after
three
hikes
last
year
but
the
trade
war
and
recent
disappointing
data
have
put
those
expectations
to
rest
investors
are
now
fully
pricing
in
a
rate
cut
to
percent
by
april
next
year
the
december
fed
funds
contract
implies
a
cash
rate
of
percent
below
the
current
percent
and
expectations
of
percent
just
a
couple
of
months
ago
in
response
treasuries
rallied
with
yields
on
paper
sinking
below
percent
to
reach
parity
with
the
federal
funds
effective
rate
for
the
first
time
since
and
yields
were
even
lower
an
inversion
that
has
sometimes
heralded
recessions
in
the
past
yields
on
benchmark
paper
dropped
to
percent
overnight
a
staggering
turnaround
from
the
highs
of
percent
seen
as
recently
as
november
the
falls
kept
the
dollar
on
the
defensive
the
greenback
plumbed
a
more
than
low
of

the
yen
on
thursday
driven
by
technical
factors
amid
thin
holiday
trade
it
has
fallen
more
than

so
far
this
week
the
biggest
weekly
loss
since

february
and
was
last
at
the
ism
has
a
long
and
big
moves
often
prove
to
be
meaningful
the
december
drop
therefore
gives
pause
even
to
us
economic
optimists
said
