global
markets
were
on
edge
on
friday
as
dire
economic
data
slammed
wall

and
pushed
investors
to
bet
the
federal

could
reverse
its
policy
tightening
before
the

fears

growth
roiled
assets
in
driving
a
surge
in
volatility
and
sending
major
stock
markets
deep
into
the
red
those
worries
found
some
basis
this
week
with
thursday
s
disappointing
survey
data
from
the
institute
for
supply
management
ism
showing
factory
activity
slowed
more
than
expected
in
december
that
followed
apple
inc
s
announcement
on
wednesday
that
it
had
cut
its
revenue
forecast
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
years
blaming
weaker
iphone
sales
in
china
its
shares
crashed
nearly
percent
overnight
the
dismal
ism
report
drove
investors
to
the
safety
of
bonds
yields
on
the
treasuries
sank
below
percent
to
reach
parity
with
the
federal
funds
effective
rate
for
the
first
time
since
and
yields
were
even
lower
an
inversion
that
has
sometimes
heralded
recessions
in
the
past
yields
on
benchmark
paper
dropped
to
percent
a
staggering
turnaround
from
the
highs
of
percent
seen
as
recently
as
november
the
falls
kept
the
dollar
on
the
defensive
the
greenback
plumbed
a
more
than
low
of
against
the
yen
on
thursday
driven
by
technical
factors
amid
thin
holiday
trade
it
has
fallen
more
than
percent
so
far
this
week
the
biggest
weekly
loss
since
last
february
and
was
last
at
the
ism
manufacturing
index
tumbled
more
than
five
points
a
drop
of
this
magnitude
has
only
been
seen
four
times
since
three
of
which
the
economy
was
in
the
midst
of
recession
said
michelle
girard
economist
at
rbs
the
ism
has
a
long
and
big
moves
often
prove
to
be
meaningful
the
december
drop
therefore
gives
pause
even
to
us
economic
optimists
girard
added
now
a
indicator
is
flashing
yellow
putting
ourselves
and
likely
the
federal
reserve
on
higher
investors
had
expected
the
fed
to
stay
on
its
tightening
path
after
three
hikes
last
year
but
the
ongoing
trade
war
and
recent
disappointing
corporate
earnings
have
put
those
expectations
to
rest
the
december
fed
funds
contract
imply
a
cash
rate
of
percent
below
the
current
percent
and
expectations
of
percent
just
a
couple
of
months
ago
investors
see
rates
at
percent
by
april
next
year
markets
have
sharply
the
outlook
for
the
fed
with
a
rate
cut
percent
priced
by
december
and
fully
priced
by
april
said
tapas
strickland
markets
strategist
for
national
australia
bank
whether
this
pessimism
continues
for
the
rest
of
will
largely
depend
on
whether
there
is
a
resolution
to
the
trade
war
strickland
added
concerns
about
a
recession
whacked
wall
street
overnight
with
the
dow
skidding

the

and
nasdaq
losing
more

msci
