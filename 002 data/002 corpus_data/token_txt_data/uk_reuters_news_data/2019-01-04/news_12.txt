world
stock

rallied
on
friday
after
china
s
central
bank
moved
to
support
its
slowing
economy
chinese
services
data
pointed
to
positive
growth
and
beijing
announced
a
new
round
of
trade
talks
with
washington
markets
were
buoyed
by
the
resumption
of
trade
talks
between
china
and
the
united
states
and
by
encouraging
surveys
of
china
s
services
sector
a
slew
of
weak
data
had
showed
china
s
economy
was
losing
steam
china
s
central
bank
said
on
friday
it
was
cutting
the
amount
of
cash
that
banks
must
hold
as
reserves
for
the
fifth
time
in
the
past
year
freeing
billion
for
new
lending
as
it
tries
to
reduce
the
risk
of
a
sharper
economic
slowdown
the
boost
from
china
brought
some
respite
to
battered
markets
with
msci
s
world
stock
index
up
a
third
of
a

and
stock
futures
around

we
re
not
expecting
a
major
breakthrough
in

talks
on
said
edward
park
deputy
chief
investment
officer
at
brooks
macdonald
that
said
where
equity
markets
are
in
terms
of
valuations
if
you
look
at
the
two
core
risks
trade
and
the
fed
there
s
room
for
markets
to
be
positively
surprised
in
both
of
those
global
markets
have
had
a
rough
start
to
hurt
by
a
revenue
warning
from
iphone
maker
apple
and
concern
about
slowing
global
economic
growth
but
on
friday
a
rally
in
european
markets
gathered
steam
after
a
cautious
move
higher
in
asian
stocks
europe
s
stoxx
index
rose
percent
while
germany
s
dax
jumped
percent
and
was
set
for
its
best
day
in
a
month
in
asia
shanghai
blue
chips
rose
percent
while
south
korean
shares
bounced
percent
but
japan
s
nikkei
skidded
over
percent
on
its
first
trading
day
of
the
year
hobbled
by
growth
worries
and
the
strength
of
the
yen
the
yen
edged
back
from
its
recent
surge
on
friday
on
hopes
the
trade
talks
would
make
some
progress
but
the
japanese
currency
remains
well
bid
by
investors
fretting
about
a
global
economic
slowdown
the
yen
fell
as
much
as
percent
against
the
dollar
to
before
recovering
some
of
those
losses
to
trade
at
around
the
euro
held
above
the
single
currency
traded
up
percent
at
despite
a
survey
showing
that
euro
zone
business
activity
fell
to
a
low
in
december
and
official
data
showing
that
inflation
in
december
had
slowed
by
more
than
expected
the
dollar
index
which
measures
the
currency
against
a
basket
of
rivals
was
percent
lower
at
the
improving
tone
also
fed
through
to
europe
s
bond
markets
pushing
yields
on
safe
haven
assets
such
as
germany
s
government
bond
off
lows
hit
this
week
but
analysts
are
unconvinced
that
the
trade
talks
and
subsequent
relief
rally
signal
sustained
improvements
particularly
in
a
new
era
of
tightening
liquidity
central
banks
are
trying
to
get
markets
weaned
off
the
idea
that
they
will
come
riding
to
the
rescue
and
people
are
trying
to
learn
what
the
new
rules
of
the
game
are
said
colin
harte
head
of
research
solutions
at
bnp
paribas
asset
management
harte
added
that
he
was
sceptical
that
the
talks
would
have
a
meaningful
resolution
the
picture
will
remain
unclear
for
the
first
half
of
this
year
he
said
german
bond
yields
while
higher
on
friday
were
still
set
for
their
biggest
weekly
fall
since
october
down
around
basis
points
the
move
is
evidence
of
a
key
change
in
central
bank
expectations
bob
michele
chief
investment
officer
and
head
of
fixed
income
at
jp
morgan
asset
management
said
with
rate
cut
expectations
and
a
slowdown
in
the
does
it
look
realistic
that
the
ecb
will
raise
rates
at
all
this
year
he
added
in
such
a
environment
michele
said
the
european
central
bank
might
conceivably
return
to
quantitative
easing
which
would
push
bond
yields
even
lower
money
markets
are
pricing
in
just
a
percent
chance
of
a
ecb
rate
hike
in
the
risk
of
a
economic
downturn
or
even
a
recession
has
caused
a
tectonic
shift
in
expectations
for
interest
rates
with
investors
now
pricing
in
the
possibility
of
a
cut
investors
will
be
looking
for
any
clues
from
federal
reserve
chair
jerome
powell
who
is
due
to
speak
on
friday
as
well
as
the
latest
jobs
numbers
released
later
this
session
while
the
fed
is
still
projecting
two
more
rate
increases
this
year
the
futures
market
implies
the
next
move
will
be
down
with
around
a
percent
probability
of
a
move
by
year
end
the
market
is
fully
pricing
in
an
easing
to
percent
by
may
next
year
from
the
current
range
of
percent
the
mounting
speculation
sent
yields
on
treasuries
as
low
as
percent
taking
them
under
the
effective
federal
funds
rate
for
the
first
time
since
they
were
last
trading
at
percent
and
yields
were
even
lower
an
inversion
that
has
sometimes
heralded
recessions
in
the
past
yields
on
benchmark
paper
dropped
to
percent
overnight
a
turnaround
from
the
highs
of
percent
seen
as
recently
as
november
elsewhere
the
news
of
the
trade
talks
boosted
oil
prices
with
brent
crude
oil
was
percent
higher
at
dollars
