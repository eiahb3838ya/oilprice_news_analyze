airline

the

led
by
outspoken
ceo
alan

has
to
many
embodied
the
industry
s
turnaround
the
australian
airline
nicknamed
the
flying
kangaroo
swung
from
a
record
loss
in
to
forecast
a
record
profit
in
the
financial
year
ending
june
as
it
cut
costs
boosted
revenue
and
benefited
from
lower
oil
prices
shares
have
risen
since
late
but
now
like
other
carriers
it
is
grappling
with
the
return
of
a
barrel
oil
rising
airport
charges
and
a
global
pilot
shortage
that
has
led
it
to
cancel
flights
and
invest
a
million
million
in
a
new
training
school
iata
which
represents
about
airlines
comprising
percent
of
global
air
traffic
in
december
predicted
a
record
billion
of
net
profit
for
the
airline
industry
in
with
billion
coming
from
and
european
airlines
that
estimate
however
assumed
an
average
oil
price
of
a
barrel
in
an
updated
profit
forecast
to
be
issued
on
monday
will
be
lower
as
the
cost
of
oil
infrastructure
and
labour
rises
iata
ceo
alexandre
de
juniac
told
reporters
in
sydney
on
thursday
we
have
seen
a
rise
in
the
fuel
cost
now
for
almost
months
he
said
usually
you
see
an
impact
on
fares
to
months
after
but
for
the
moment
i
have
to
say
the
fuel
increase
has
not
been
passed
on
in
major
airlines
the
biggest
of
which
have
not
hedged
fuel
costs
reported
a
percent
or
million
decline
in
profits
in
the
quarter
that
ended
march
compared
with
a
year
earlier
as
rising
costs
crimped
margins
according
to
data
from
trade
group
airlines
for
america
several
major
airline
ceos
notably
in
europe
have
warned
that
rising
oil
prices
could
put
pressure
on
carriers
in
the
northern
hemisphere
summer
that
might
lead
to
further
consolidation
or
bankruptcies
after
the
collapse
of
air
berlin
and
monarch
airlines
last
year
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
to
see
a
few
of
these
weaker
carriers
slip
further
into
difficulties
and
potentially
see
some
exits
from
the
market
in
the
latter
part
of
this
year
willie
walsh
ceo
of
british
airways
and
iberian
parent
iag
said
in
early
may
lower
oil
prices
have
allowed
airlines
to
expand
rapidly
with
lower
costs
helping
spur
percent
growth
in
passenger
demand
last
year
well
above
the
average
annual
growth
rate
of
percent
if
they
are
forced
to
start
raising
prices
that
traffic
growth
could
very
quickly
disappear
at
the
same
time
that
profits
disappear
said
peter
harbison
executive
chairman
of
capa
centre
for
aviation
flying
remains
uncertain
because
of
the
need
to
pursue
deals
but
a
dispute
between
and
gulf
carriers
that
had
led
to
vigorous
debate
over
subsidies
at
previous
iata
gatherings
has
finally
been
put
to
rest
that
could
leave
more
time
for
industry
leaders
to
focus
on
improving
safety
after
a
poor
start
to
the
year
following
a
performance
so
positive
that
president
donald
trump
in
january
took
credit
for
the
best
and
safest
year
on
record
in
a
tweet
five
serious
aviation
accidents
have
killed
people
in
the
first
five
months
of
according
to
reuters
calculations
which
compares
with
just
fatalities
in
all
of
australian
dollars
