focus-clash of the titans: rosneft takes on gazprom in gas markets
london
reuters
russian
energy
major
rosneft
is
increasingly
challenging
domestic
rival
gazprom
in
international
gas
markets
from
west
africa
to
turkey
and
even
europe
according
to
five
industry
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
last
week
rosneft
won
a
dollar
contract
in
ghana
that
had
been
targeted
by
gazprom
the
sources
said
it
also
signed
a
gas
fields
and
pipeline
deal
in
iraqi
kurdistan
aimed
at
supplying
gas
to
turkey
and
europe
gazprom
s
core
markets
rosneft
s
international
expansion
in
gas
will
put
the
two
russian
giants
in
direct
competition
particularly
in
the
lucrative
european
market
which
is
worth
over
billion
a
year
rosneft
has
also
hired
a
handful
of
employees
in
recent
months
who
advised
on
the
ghana
deal
and
has
poached
one
of
gazprom
s
senior
european
risk
officers
according
to
the
sources
and
information
on
linkedin
rosneft
and
gazprom
declined
to
comment
while
rosneft
could
potentially
take
some
gas
market
share
from
gazprom
it
is
unlikely
to
be
able
to
make
a
major
dent
in
its
rival
s
dominance
gazprom
which
has
monopoly
rights
on
gas
pipeline
exports
from
russia
is
the
world
s
biggest
gas
producer
and
the
main
supplier
to
europe
where
it
shares
has
steadily
grown
to
reach
nearly
percent
last
year
the
rosneft
drive
aimed
at
boosting
earnings
as
the
world
moves
towards
cleaner
fuels
such
as
gas
points
to
an
attempt
by
rosneft
ceo
igor
sechin
a
powerful
ally
of
president
vladimir
putin
to
further
expand
his
influence
sechin
has
repeatedly
lobbied
the
kremlin
to
curb
gazprom
s
export
rights
including
in
a
letter
to
putin
in
rosneft
has
been
long
trying
to
persuade
the
kremlin
to
dismantle
gazprom
s
monopoly
having
failed
to
do
it
from
within
russia
they
are
now
trying
to
do
this
externally
said
one
of
the
sources
who
works
with
rosneft
on
gas
projects
rosneft
announced
the
ghana
deal
last
friday
a
contract
worth
almost
billion
at
today
s
prices
to
ship
million
tonnes
of
lng
to
the
country
over
years
however
three
sources
said
the
project
was
initially
supposed
to
go
to
gazprom
which
signed
a
preliminary
deal
with
the
ghanaian
government
last
september
the
agreement
fell
apart
because
gazprom
was
slow
to
finalize
it
due
to
a
restructuring
of
its
export
division
abroad
added
the
sources
who
declined
to
be
named
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
matter
due
to
a
corporate
restructuring
gazprom
s
supply
obligations
under
the
agreement
have
been
assumed
by
rosneft
said
ghana
s
national
petroleum
corporation
which
signed
the
deal
the
kurdistan
project
had
also
been
offered
to
gazprom
although
much
earlier
at
the
end
of
last
decade
but
it
was
never
finalised
allowing
rosneft
to
expand
its
dominance
in
the
region
beyond
oil
according
to
two
sources
close
to
the
contract
the
deal
to
develop
gas
reserves
in
the
region
and
build
an
export
pipeline
was
also
announced
last
friday
but
neither
rosneft
nor
the
kurdish
regional
government
krg
have
disclosed
potential
export
volumes
or
destinations
the
two
sources
said
rosneft
would
build
a
pipeline
which
would
have
a
capacity
of
up
to
billion
cubic
meters
bcm
a
year
when
it
begins
operation
early
in
the
next
decade
the
pipeline
could
supply
up
to
bcm
of
gas
to
turkey
and
up
to
bcm
to
europe
putting
gazprom
s
russian
gas
in
competition
with
iraqi
resources
said
the
sources
a
spokesman
for
the
krg
s
national
resources
ministry
said
the
government
did
not
comment
on
the
corporate
activities
of
international
energy
companies
in
the
region
rosneft
could
also
supply
europe
with
new
volumes
from
the
giant
zohr
gas
field
in
egypt
where
it
is
a
partner
in
a
joint
venture
with
eni
and
bp
the
projects
partners
have
said
gas
would
initially
go
to
egypt
but
could
be
also
liquefied
for
exports
at
a
later
stage
rosneft
is
russia
s
most
valuable
energy
company
with
a
market
capitalization
of
billion
but
its
gas
operations
are
relatively
small
with
an
annual
output
of
bcm
though
it
is
expanding
them
rapidly
it
is
dwarfed
in
gas
by
gazprom
which
has
an
annual
output
of
bcm
gazprom
supplies
bcm
of
gas
a
year
to
europe
and
turkey
and
volumes
have
grown
steadily
in
recent
years
the
gas
giant
worth
billion
is
the
biggest
supplier
to
turkey
with
volumes
of
over
bcm
a
year
representing
more
than
percent
of
the
country
s
gas
demand
gazprom
s
biggest
rivals
in
europe
are
algeria
s
sonatrach
and
norway
s
statoil
while
globally
it
faces
competition
from
liquefied
gas
from
qatar
petroleum
and
the
united
states
one
of
rosneft
s
recent
hires
was
gazprom
s
head
of
risk
in
germany
dzhamil
bulgakov
according
to
two
sources
and
bulgakov
s
linkedin
profile
he
has
been
working
for
rosneft
s
gas
export
offices
in
germany
since
last
year
bulgakov
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
gazprom
is
currently
restructuring
its
export
division
and
plans
to
cut
hundreds
of
jobs
at
its
overseas
trading
and
export
offices
including
britain
and
move
them
to
st
petersburg
sources
told
reuters
in
march
some
former
employees
from
gazprom
s
trading
offices
have
been
working
as
advisers
to
rosneft
on
the
ghana
deal
in
recent
months
according
to
two
industry
sources
it
was
not
clear
if
the
staff
had
been
poached
from
gazprom
or
had
already
left
in
the
restructuring
