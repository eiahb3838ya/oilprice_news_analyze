london
reuters
may
was
a
manic
month
for
markets
but
brace
yourself
for
june
the
fate
of
a
historic
summit
between
north
korea
and
the
united
states
is
unclear
but
there
are
other
events
on
the
radar
to
potentially
convulse
world
markets
from
turkish
elections
to
a
swiss
referendum
on
sovereign
money
here
are
six
events
listed
chronologically
that
investors
will
be
watching
in
june
possible
swiss
shock
june
switzerland
holds
a
referendum
on
june
on
whether
to
introduce
a
sovereign
money
system
that
would
shake
up
how
its
banks
operate
the
measure
if
passed
would
bar
commercial
banks
from
creating
money
every
time
they
make
a
loan
graphic
another
swissie
shock
in
store
supporters
want
the
swiss
national
bank
to
be
the
only
authority
producing
new
money
in
the
country
but
the
snb
argues
the
plan
will
damage
its
ability
to
conduct
monetary
policy
if
the
referendum
passes
investors
could
lose
faith
in
the
swiss
franc
since
will
not
be
backed
by
assets
it
could
also
hurt
the
profits
of
swiss
banks
such
as
ubs
and
credit
suisse
opinion
polls
show
just
percent
support
for
the
change
but
as
brexit
and
the
election
showed
electoral
upsets
can
happen
fed
up
june
on
june
the
federal
reserve
should
deliver
what
will
be
the
second
of
three
interest
rate
hikes
expected
for
this
year
rates
should
rise
to
percent
graphic
fed
second
hike
the
question
now
is
whether
the
fed
might
squeeze
in
a
fourth
rate
rise
in
that
likelihood
lifted
the
dollar
in
may
to
its
best
month
since
november
interest
rates
and
treasury
yields
are
the
main
reference
rate
for
global
borrowing
costs
so
fed
chair
jerome
powell
s
statement
will
be
closely
watched
to
gauge
the
central
bank
s
intentions
the
economy
is
enjoying
its
expansion
since
world
war
two
with
unemployment
at
a
low
on
the
other
hand
trade
tensions
with
china
pose
risks
to
growth
a
hawkish
note
from
powell
could
well
fuel
a
fresh
surge
in
the
dollar
and
yields
trump
and
kim
to
meet
or
not
to
meet
the
fate
of
a
historic
korea
summit
scheduled
for
june
is
unclear
but

donald
trump
said

a

will
visit
the
white
house
on
june
to
give
trump
a

from
their
leader
kim

soaring
to

a
june
oil
producers
meeting
in
vienna
will
be
monitored
by
global
policymakers
and
market
players
since
early
members
of
the
organization
of
petroleum
exporting
countries
russia
and
some
other
producers
have
curbed
oil
output
the
pact
runs
until
the
end
of
and
the
vienna
meeting
will
discuss
whether
to
extend
it

but
oil
s

fanned

fears
the

oil
has
slipped
somewhat
after
russia
and
de
facto
opec
leader
saudi
arabia
discussed
partly
restoring
output
halted
under
the
accord
but
some
other
producers
oppose
raising
production
so
consensus
could
be
hard
to
achieve
analysts
reckon
brent
will
remain
comfortably
above
a

this
year
turkey
once
counted
among
the
most
promising
emerging
markets
has
suffered
a
massive
currency
and
bond
this
year
it
holds
an
election
on
june
with
tayyip
erdogan
expected
to
be
to
a
newly
empowered
executive
presidency
erdogan
has
overseen
strong
economic
growth
in
his
years
in
power
but
his
plans
to
take
greater
control
of
the
economy
and
monetary
policy
and
a
deepening
crackdown
on
opponents
criticised
by
rights
groups
and
western
allies
have
unnerved
many
investors

turkey
interest
rates
polls
show
support
for
erdogan
s
ak
party
and
its
nationalist
partner
at
only
around
percent
however
so
a
loss
of
parliamentary
control
may
offset
some
of
his
sweeping
powers
turkey
is
struggling
to
stabilise
the
lira
which
has
plunged
as
much
as
percent
this
year
versus
the
dollar
a
recent
percentage
point
emergency
increase
in
interest
rates
was
almost
immediately
undermined
by
erdogan
a
enemy
of
interest
rates
the
central
bank
meets
formally
on
june
and
could
take
further
steps
to
stabilise
the
currency
with
time
running
out
for
britain
to
secure
a
deal
before
exiting
the
european

says
london
is
yet
to
come
up
with
a
viable

the

that
reinstating

revive
