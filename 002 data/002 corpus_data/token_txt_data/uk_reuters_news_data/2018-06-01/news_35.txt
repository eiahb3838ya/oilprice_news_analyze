the
european
bank
for
reconstruction
and
development
has
published
guidance
for
companies
reporting
on
the
physical
impact
of
climate
change
in
their
financial
results
concerns
in
the
financial
community
that
assets
are
being
mispriced
because
climate
risk
is
not
being
factored
into
financial
reporting
has
prompted
demand
for
more
meaningful
and
transparent
financial
information
a
global
task
force
set
up
by
the
the
task
force
on
financial
disclosure
tcfd
has
developed
a
voluntary
framework
for
companies
to
disclose
the
financial
impact
of
risks
and
opportunities
around
two
thirds
of
member
states
have
engaged
with
the
framework
since
its
launch
last
year
a
study
by
the
cambridge
institute
for
sustainability
leadership
shows
however
the
tcfd
framework
does
not
provide
much
concrete
detail
on
the
metrics
for
reporting
climate
risks
and
opportunities
in
financial
disclosures
the
european
bank
for
reconstruction
and
development
ebrd
and
the
global
centre
for
excellence
on
climate
adaptation
gceca
therefore
conducted
an
analysis
with
working
groups
in
the
financial
and
corporate
sectors
to
identify
a
standard
set
of
metrics
the
working
groups
included
representatives
from
organisations
and
firms
such
as
the
organisation
for
economic
and
development
allianz
the
bank
of
england
barclays
maersk
lloyds
shell
blackrock
and
zurich
asset
management
they
came
up
with
recommendations
for
firms
when
disclosing
climate
impacts
which
include
projecting
physical
climate
effects
such
as
droughts
heat
stress
and
extreme
rainfall
on
their
assets
or
financial
instruments
lifetime
over
a
five
to
time
frame
risks
beyond
years
should
also
be
assessed
using
scenarios
to
account
for
uncertainty
in
climate
policy
and
impacts
of
climate
change
the
guidance
said
another
recommendation
is
for
firms
to
assess
the
potential
changes
in
their
value
chains
as
a
result
of
physical
climate
impacts
and
potential
market
shifts
as
customer
needs
change
companies
should
also
describe
their
processes
for
identifying
assessing
and
managing
climate
risks
such
as
risk
management
processes
insurance
coverage
planned
facility
moves
or
retrofits
and
corporate
climate
resilience
strategy
last
week
a
survey
by
a
uk
committee
of
lawmakers
showed
that
seven
out
of
britain
s
largest
pension
funds
have
committed
to
report
on
climate
risks
in
line
with
the
tcfd
framework
eight
are
considering
to
do
so
while
have
no
plans
to
do
so
