where's the data? angst for commods traders as china trade figures held in limbo
beijing
reuters
commodities
traders
have
been
waiting
more
than
a
week
for
china
to
release
overdue
monthly
data
frustrating
many
market
watchers
and
fuelling
speculation
about
reasons
for
the
delay
the
prolonged
wait
for
final
april
commodities
trade
statistics
from
the
world
s
top
buyer
of
oil
metals
and
grains
comes
as
negotiators
from
washington
gather
in
beijing
for
a
round
of
talks
aimed
at
avoiding
an
trade
war
the
april
data
initially
due
on
may
will
show
the
scale
of
market
disruptions
since
washington
and
beijing
embarked
on
escalating
tariff
threats
roiling
flows
of
commodities
such
as
soybeans
sorghum
and
corn
traders
were
hoping
to
glean
from
the
final
april
data
signs
that
china
had
stopped
buying
american
agricultural
goods
or
started
to
switch
to
buying
more
from
other
countries
such
as
brazil
russia
and
australia
the
company
which
collates
and
sells
the
data
china
cuslink
co
ltd
which
is
operated
by
customs
was
ordered
to
delay
publication
indefinitely
due
to
technical
reasons
three
officials
at
the
company
told
reuters
one
said
the
instructions
came
from
customs
while
another
said
it
was
from
another
government
agency
the
officials
who
declined
to
be
identified
gave
no
further
details
a
spokesman
for
general
administration
of
customs
confirmed
the
suspension
but
gave
no
reason
while
the
timing
of
the
delay
may
be
coincidence
some
traders
speculated
beijing
may
want
to
conceal
statistics
that
could
somehow
undermine
its
negotiating
stance
but
michael
mao
senior
energy
analyst
in
shandong
province
at
china
sublime
information
group
doubted
there
was
a
link
if
beijing
wants
to
adjust
the
april
data
to
sweeten
trade
talks
it
won
t
work
for
obvious
reasons
mao
said
if
the
official
data
and
shipping
data
don
t
match
analysts
are
smart
enough
to
tell
that
authorities
massaged
official
companies
like
thomson
reuters
and
other
media
companies
and
consultancies
pay
to
receive
the
final
statistics
which
give
a
breakdown
by
import
origin
and
export
destination
for
everything
from
sorghum
to
natural
gas
and
steel
mao
said
speculation
had
circulated
in
the
market
that
beijing
was
considering
stopping
the
sale
of
the
data
to
some
companies
reuters
was
not
able
to
verify
this
traders
and
analysts
seeking
to
use
the
data
to
devise
trading
strategies
expressed
frustration
at
the
delay
and
lack
of
information
it
is
such
nonsense
to
delay
the
data
for
political
reasons
said
one
veteran
oil
trader
who
declined
to
be
identified
as
he
is
not
authorised
to
speak
to
the
media
it
s
not
unusual
for
statistical
releases
to
be
postponed
by
a
day
or
two
and
many
analysts
and
trade
experts
have
anyway
long
questioned
the
accuracy
of
official
chinese
economic
data
the
delay
also
comes
as
china
s
customs
department
undergoes
a
major
overhaul
taking
on
extra
functions
including
import
safety
which
was
previously
handled
by
a
separate
agency
as
part
of
a
broader
effort
to
make
policymaking
more
efficient
still
an
indefinite
delay
without
a
clear
explanation
is
extremely
rare
experts
say
preliminary
numbers
showing
total
imports
and
exports
earlier
in
the
month
revealed
upheaval
in
flows
of
grains
such
as
sorghum
which
were
temporarily
hit
with
sanctions
by
china
the
wait
for
the
data
comes
as
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
heads
to
beijing
for
talks
aimed
at
narrowing
china
s
billion
billion
pounds
trade
surplus
an
effort
washington
hopes
results
in
china
significantly
ramping
up
purchases
of
american
farm
products
and
energy
ross
is
due
in
beijing
on
june
to
on
wednesday
a
delegation
of
more
than
officials
arrived
in
the
chinese
capital
for
talks
according
to
china
s
commerce
ministry
michael
lion
a
china
metals
industry
veteran
who
is
president
of
lion
consulting
asia
in
hong
kong
said
the
delay
may
be
a
strategic
decision
while
trade
talks
continue
it
would
be
consistent
from
my
experience
for
the
chinese
authorities
to
withhold
information
that
they
might
believe
could
be
used
by
counterparties
in
negotiations
lion
told
reuters
by
email
some
market
participants
are
resigned
to
a
long
wait
as
the
veteran
oil
trader
noted
customs
will
probably
delay
the
data
until
china
solves
the
trade
dispute
