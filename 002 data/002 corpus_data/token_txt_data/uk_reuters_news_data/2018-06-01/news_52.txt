analysis-new zealand push on clean power comes with high political, economic risks
reuters
new
zealand
has
set
out
to
burnish
its
clean
green
image
by
becoming
asia
pacific
s
first
developed
economy
to
stop
using
fossil
fuels
to
generate
power
although
the
pitfalls
encountered
by
a
maori
iwi
or
tribe
may
signal
trouble
ahead
the
ngaati
kea
ngaati
tuara
iwi
in
rotorua
when
switching
to
renewables
found
local
geothermal
sources
were
not
hot
enough
to
generate
electricity
so
the
tribe
set
up
small
hydro
units
for
its
meeting
ground
and
dairy
farm
but
the
units
struggle
to
operate
during
floods
and
to
produce
enough
power
at
peak
demand
said
project
manager
eugene
a
battery
could
store
energy
for
periods
of
high
use
but
there
is
currently
no
appetite
to
invest
the
more
than
needed
he
said
new
zealand
in
its
push
to
be
free
of
power
fired
by
coal
and
natural
gas
would
likely
face
similar
problems
scaled
to
national
size
and
potentially
billions
of
dollars
in
costs
if
we
move
too
quickly
the
risk
is
to
the
new
zealand
consumer
having
to
pay
more
for
their
energy
and
this
could
make
new
zealand
less
competitive
as
a
market
said
marc
england
chief
executive
of
new
zealand
s
biggest
energy
retailer
and
generator
genesis
energy
other
countries
that
have
turned
fully
to
renewables
for
power
such
as
norway
and
denmark
are
connected
to
regional
grids
that
can
help
back
up
shortages
new
zealand
in
the
remote
south
pacific
would
not
have
that
option
for
graphic
on
new
zealand
power
prices
are
low
click
new
zealand
would
need
large
batteries
extra
wind
and
solar
power
and
might
still
need
to
use
gas
or
coal
to
prevent
blackouts
such
investments
would
send
costs
soaring
and
could
alienate
voters
who
elected
prime
minister
jacinda
ardern
last
year
in
part
due
to
her
pledge
to
counter
climate
change
ardern
said
in
april
the
government
was
also
halting
new
offshore
oil
and
gas
exploration
permits
as
part
of
efforts
to
convert
the
nation
to
renewable
energy
by
critics
say
ardern
s
goals
would
require
huge
investments
in
renewable
energy
sources
grid
expansion
and
an
overhaul
of
new
zealand
s
biggest
export
industry
dairy
which
relies
heavily
on
coal
driving
up
power
prices
sapere
research
group
advised
wellington
its
goals
would
require
wholesale
electricity
prices
to
rise
by
up
to
percent
to
around
nz
per
mwh
making
them
some
of
the
highest
in
the
world
that
would
destroy
a
key
advantage
for
agriculture
and
industry
in
new
zealand
where
baseload
power
futures
are
currently
running
about
percent
less
than
in
australian
states
new
south
wales
and
victoria
where
soaring
electricity
costs
have
forced
some
manufacturers
to
shut
a
backlash
from
industry
and
politicians
has
deepened
partisan
fault
lines
that
ardern
s
government
installed
in
october
is
trying
so
smooth
over
but
the
criticism
has
not
stopped
her
from
looking
to
establish
a
legacy
by
combating
climate
change
ardern
s
government
has
set
a
goal
for
the
country
to
be
carbon
neutral
by
emitting
no
more
carbon
dioxide
than
its
biosphere
can
absorb
an
effort
she
compares
to
an
earlier
generation
standing
against
nuclear
warfare
and
declaring
new
zealand
a
nuclear
free
zone
climate
change
minister
james
shaw
has
set
up
a
panel
to
develop
a
carbon
neutrality
plan
by
and
a
public
and
business
consultation
is
scheduled
for
june
we
need
to
be
looking
at
more
renewable
generation
and
potentially
storage
to
replace
our
aging
fossil
fuel
generators
as
well
as
energy
efficiency
initiatives
to
better
manage
demand
shaw
told
reuters
new
zealand
gets
more
than
percent
of
its
energy
from
renewables
mostly
hydropower
another
percent
comes
from
natural
gas
and
percent
from
coal
fonterra
group
however
the
world
s
top
dairy
exporter
and
one
of
new
zealand
s
biggest
energy
users
gets
around
of
its
energy
from
fossil
fuels
fonterra
is
trying
to
ditch
coal
but
a
change
is
going
to
require
significant
investment
said
chief
operating
officer
robert
spurway
it
s
very
important
to
us
that
we
find
ways
to
do
this
in
an
economically
sustainable
way
so
that
we
remain
competitive
globally
spurway
told
reuters
part
of
the
problem
is
that
while
most
of
the
population
and
industry
is
on
the
north
island
most
of
the
hydro
stations
are
on
the
south
island
that
increases
the
outage
risk
because
of
the
possibility
of
damage
to
the
cables
connecting
the
two
islands
the
inconvenient
truth
in
new
zealand
is
for
decades
we
ve
used
coal
to
back
up
hydroelectricity
genesis
ceo
england
told
reuters
new
zealand
s
biggest
power
plant
huntly
owned
by
genesis
was
due
to
shut
its
coal
units
in
but
rival
generator
meridian
energy
agreed
to
pay
genesis
to
keep
them
open
as
at
least
until
genesis
said
batteries
are
not
yet
an
economic
option
to
fall
back
on
through
extended
droughts
new
zealand
lakes
have
only
up
to
eight
weeks
of
water
storage
while
norway
has
about
two
years
worth
many
analysts
still
say
new
zealand
s
plan
to
go
green
is
viable
and
will
benefit
the
country
although
england
said
switching
to
electric
vehicles
ev
to
wean
transport
off
petrol
would
be
better
than
percent
renewable
power
generation
ev
could
be
a
better
economic
choice
for
the
market
as
a
whole
he
said
said
power
independence
has
become
a
point
of
pride
for
the
ngaati
kea
ngaati
tuara
iwi
and
that
he
gets
requests
each
month
from
other
tribes
interested
in
making
similar
changes
they
like
the
idea
that
we
