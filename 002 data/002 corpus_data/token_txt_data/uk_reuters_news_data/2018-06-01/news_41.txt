a
power
cable
being
laid
between
germany
and
norway
may
lower
norwegian
energy
prices
in
its
first
years
as
wind
power
in
northern
germany
at
times
can
not
be
exported
further
south
due
to
grid
bottlenecks
norway
s
statnett
said
nordlink
a
interconnector
that
will
begin
operations
in
will
export
power
produced
by
dams
from
norway
to
germany
it
could
also
import
power
the
project
and
other
planned
cables
have
been
under
fire
in
norway
over
concerns
the
nordic
country
would
lose
its
cheap
power
supply
by
exporting
electricity
to
germany
cheap
power
has
been
a
draw
for
industries
in
norway
statnett
spokesman
christer
gilje
said
the
new
cable
could
initially
lower
prices
for
norwegian
customers
until
germany
s
grid
is
upgraded
to
distribute
the
extra
supplies
from
nordlink
although
he
said
prices
would
rise
after
power
prices
in
norway
may
sometimes
be
lower
in
the
beginning
he
said
on
a
visit
to
the
site
where
a
bright
yellow
subsea
cable
was
being
connected
to
norway
s
grid
on
land
he
said
this
was
because
germany
now
sometimes
had
surplus
power
from
wind
generation
in
the
north
pushing
down
prices
as
the
german
grid
could
not
yet
transmit
the
extra
power
south
when
you
have
a
big
surplus
that
drives
prices
down
to
zero
and
sometimes
actually
below
zero
in
germany
it
will
affect
norwegian
prices
he
said
without
saying
by
how
much
after
the
billion
euro
billion
cable
would
increase
norwegian
power
prices
by
an
estimated
one
euro
per
megawatt
hour
he
said
this
week
statnett
began
laying
the
second
of
two
gigawatt
subsea
wires
that
together
make
up
the
interconnector
in
a
fjord
in
the
southwest
of
the
country
the
norwegian
subsea
part
will
be
completed
this
year
