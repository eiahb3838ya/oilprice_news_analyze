foundation
cameroon
has
cut
thousands
of
hectares
of
forest
to
build
stadiums
hotels
roads
and
housing
to
host
the
africa
cup
of
nations
a
move
that
could
lead
to
worsening
urban
flooding
and
droughts
the
country
s
environmental
groups
warn
cameroon
s
ability
to
host
the
africa
football
cup
of
nations
depends
on
the
availability
of
adapted
modern
infrastructure
said
oumarou
tado
secretary
general
of
cameroon
s
ministry
of
sports
and
physical
education
it
is
regrettable
that
many
of
these
new
projects
have
led
to
vast
deforestation
but
we
had
to
meet
the
strict
guidelines
of
the
african
football
confederation
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
yaounde
the
capital
about
hectares
of
trees
were
cut
to
build
the
new
olembe
stadium
about
km
from
the
centre
of
the
city
in
limbe
hectares
of
forests
were
removed
to
create
space
for
a
stadium
and
a
sport
training
facility
much
more
land
has
been
cleared
to
build
other
facilities
related
to
the
competition
including
roads
hotels
and
large
new
tracts
of
housing
environmentalists
say
part
of
what
has
driven
tree
cutting
tado
said
is
that
specifications
for
cup
of
nations
infrastructure
improvements
require
the
new
facilities
to
be
built
in
areas
that
are
easily
accessible
but
without
traffic
problems
these
specifications
were
found
in
forested
areas
on
the
outskirts
of
major
cities
he
said
cameroon
s
legendary
world
cup
soccer
player
roger
milla
a
sports
ambassador
for
the
country
said
forested
areas
had
to
give
way
to
improve
the
country
s
sporting
facilities
noting
that
to
make
omelets
one
has
to
break
eggs
cameroon
is
a
lead
football
nation
in
africa
but
paradoxically
without
modern
sports
infrastructure
we
have
been
waiting
for
this
for
a
long
time
said
milla
whose
foundation
coeur
d
afrique
has
taken
part
in
tree
planting
efforts
in
yaounde
since
environment
experts
however
have
criticised
the
decision
to
build
on
forested
areas
saying
urban
trees
must
be
protected
if
the
country
is
to
avoid
worsening
impacts
of
climate
change
including
flooding
and
droughts
forests
are
very
important
in
regulating
city
climate
thus
their
loss
or
degradation
is
a
major
source
of
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
which
contributes
to
climate
change
and
is
a
big
threat
to
the
livelihood
of
the
population
said
samuel
nguifo
executive
director
of
the
centre
for
environment
and
development
a
yaounde
environmental
he
said
forests
act
as
air
conditioners
for
cities
cooling
residents
suffering
increasingly
hot
weather
cameroon
has
in
recent
years
seen
large
areas
of
forest
cut
for
mining
projects
new
ports
hydroelectric
dams
and
other
projects
under
the
country
s
vision
project
that
economic
development
plan
aims
to
slash
widespread
unemployment
and
cut
cameroon
s
poverty
rate
from
percent
in
to
less
than
percent
by
between
and
cameroon
lost
nearly
hectares
of
trees
a
percent
reduction
in
the
country
s
forests
according
to
data
from
global
forest
watch
a
forest
monitoring
initiative
more
than
half
of
all
the
tree
losses
were
in
the
centre
south
east
and
littoral
regions
where
most
new
investment
projects
are
concentrated
the
data
showed
adding
football
infrastructure
has
now
made
the
pressure
on
cameroon
s
existing
deforestation
hotspots
worse
forest
experts
said
these
new
sports
infrastructure
projects
will
only
increase
the
susceptibility
of
these
cities
to
the
effects
of
climate
change
said
julius
chuezi
tieguhong
a
forest
researcher
with
the
african
forest
forum
the
cities
of
douala
yaounde
and
limbe
have
in
recent
years
faced
worsening
water
shortages
floods
and
rising
temperatures
all
problems
likely
to
become
worse
as
forest
is
cut
tieguhong
said
in
some
roads
and
buildings
in
cameroon
s
economic
hub
douala
were
submerged
following
days
of
heavy
rains
while
in
yaounde
the
sight
of
women
and
children
trekking
across
the
city
to
fetch
scarce
drinking
water
has
become
increasingly
common
cameroon
s
government
however
is
hopeful
that
teaming
up
with
city
authorities
to
plant
more
urban
trees
can
offset
some
of
the
damage
jules
doret
ndongo
the
country
s
ministry
of
forestry
and
wildlife
this
month
signed
a
deal
with
city
councils
in
regions
of
the
country
to
plant
more
city
trees
and
create
new
parks
the
effort
is
a
combined
forest
floods
drought
and
water
shortage
protection
effort
he
said
the
government
says
city
councils
will
receive
over
million
fcfa
million
annually
to
help
curb
deforestation
according
to
bruno
mfou
ou
mfou
ou
director
of
forestry
in
the
ministry
of
forestry
and
wildlife
tree
planting
efforts
will
target
areas
particularly
suffering
flooding
or
drought
targeting
vulnerable
areas
is
critical
in
the
fight
against
climate
disasters
he
said
the
city
tree
project
comes
on
top
of
a
government
project
that
aims
to
restore
million
hectares
of
deforested
land
