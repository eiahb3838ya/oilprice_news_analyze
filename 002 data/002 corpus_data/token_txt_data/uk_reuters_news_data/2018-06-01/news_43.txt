fell

welcomed
an

prospects
of
a

put
a
dampener
on

the

it
was

where
prime

mariano
rajoy
set
to
be
forced
out
of

by
a
vote
we
ve
had
a
rude
awakening
of
european
political
risks
this
week
so
the
potential
fall
of
the
spanish
government
would
cause
volatility
but
the
situation
in
spain
is
very
different
from
italy
said
michael
metcalfe
head
of
global
macro
strategy
state
street
global
markets
the
parties
leading
in
the
polls
in
spain
are
centrists
so
we
re
not
getting
the

extremes

we
have
in
of
potentially
greater
concerns
to
investors

outside
japan
rose
percent
but
the

was
still
down
roughly
percent

reflecting
earlier
concerns
about
italy
s
struggle
to
form
a
government
that
drove
it
to
a
low

markets

likely
to
feel
pressure
said
soichiro
monji
senior

at

sb
investments
in
tokyo
as
the
united
states
has
opened
up
a
new
point
of
contention
on
the
trade
front
by
getting
involved
with
the
european
union
president
donald
trump
has
not
accomplished
very
much
in

issues

likely
to
remain
vocal

the
elections
coming
up
the

traders
said
chinese

the
inclusion
of
