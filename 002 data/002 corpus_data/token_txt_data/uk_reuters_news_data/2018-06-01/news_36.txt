plans
to
raise
its
annual
production
of

lng
to
as
much
as
million

take
market
share
from

and

by
capitalising
on

in
the

with
capacity
of
million

per

seen
reachable
by
the
end
of

highlights
russia
s
ability
to
produce
lng
in
harsh
climates
and
further
strengthens
its
foothold
in
the
global
energy
market
russia
may
set
a
goal
of
producing
million
tonnes
of
lng
per
year
by
deputy
energy
minister
pavel
sorokin
said
in
an
interview
we
understand
this
from
our
discussions
with
the
companies
about
their
potential
which
they
can
add
to
their
previously
announced
yamal
lng
aims
to
help
russia
double
the
country
s
share
of
the
global
lng
market
by
from
about
percent
now
qatar
aided
by
production
costs
that
are
among
the
world
s
lowest
is
the
biggest
lng
exporter
with
a
percent
market

novatek
also
plans
to
launch
lng
production
at
the
neighbouring
gydan
peninsula
russia

including
shell
launched
the
country
s
first
lng
plant
in
on
the
pacific
island
of
sakhalin
with
a
capacity
of
more
than
million
tonnes
per
year
yamal
lng
has
produced
around
million
tonnes
since
its
launch
in
december
so
far
russia
has
been
the
dominant
player
in
pipeline
gas
supplies
to
europe
with
gazprom
supplying
around
a
third
of
the
continent
s
needs
demand
for
seaborne
lng
has
taken
off
in
recent
years
as
it
is
cleaner
than
oil
or
coal
and
can
reach
markets
worldwide
because
it
does
not
depend
on
pipeline
networks
lng
is
typically
more
expensive
than
pipeline
gas
however
sorokin
said
he
expects
global
lng
demand
almost
to
double
in
the
next
years
to
exceed
million
tonnes
per
year
export
capacity
has
shot
up
from
less
than
million
tonnes
per
year
in
to
million
tonnes
in
and
is
projected
to
top
million
by
that
would
see
the
united
states
leapfrog
australia
to
become
the
world
s
no
exporter
what
will
trigger
the
rivalry
are
the
additional
volumes
that
the
or
australia
could
supply
sorokin
said
adding
that
russian
companies
are
highly
competitive
due
to
their
low
costs
for
production
and
transportation
according
to
the
skolkovo
think
tank
average
production
and
transportation
costs
at
yamal
lng
for
exports
to
shanghai
are
seen
at
just
above
per
million
british
thermal
units
mbtu
by
that
is
roughly
the
same
as
the
cost
for
lng
projects
in
western
australia
and
less
than
the
approximately
for
lng
exports
from
the
southeastern
united
states
the
same
figure
for
stands
at
below
the
lowest
among
current
global
