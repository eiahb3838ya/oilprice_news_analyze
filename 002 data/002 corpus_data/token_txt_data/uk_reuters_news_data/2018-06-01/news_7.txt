refile-analysis-brazil strike boosts far right candidate's shot at presidency
brasilia
reuters
presidential
candidate
jair
bolsonaro
went
out
on
a
limb
to
support
a
truckers
strike
that
paralysed
brazil
and
forced
the
government
to
reinstate
costly
fuel
subsidies
and
the
strategy
may
have
helped
his
chances
of
beating
one
of
several
reform
candidates
in
october
s
election
the
scale
of
the
truckers
stoppage
overwhelmed
president
michel
temer
s
unpopular
government
which
was
pressured
into
granting
truckers
demands
as
airports
ran
out
of
fuel
grocery
shelves
emptied
and
drivers
waited
hours
to
fill
their
tanks
despite
these
disruptions
truckers
won
support
from
many
brazilians
angry
at
a
surge
in
diesel
prices
since
state
oil
company
petrobras
scrapped
subsidies
under
temer
an
opinion
poll
on
wednesday
found
that
percent
of
brazilians
supported
the
strike
centrist
candidates
such
as
former
sao
paulo
governor
geraldo
alckmin
and
ruling
party
candidate
henrique
meirelles
did
not
come
out
in
support
of
the
truckers
when
they
blocked
brazil
s
main
highways
there
has
been
no
poll
on
voter
intentions
yet
to
show
whether
lack
of
support
for
the
strike
hurt
these
politicians
who
back
further
fiscal
that
many
voters
oppose
but
investors
would
like
to
see
bolsonaro
a
former
army
captain
turned
congressman
running
on
an
platform
praised
the
truckers
in
social
media
messages
for
fighting
extortionist
taxes
levied
by
temer
s
corrupt
government
ahead
of
the
election
bolsonaro
had
just
under
percent
support
giving
him
the
lead
in
polls
that
exclude
jailed
leftist
luis
inacio
lula
da
silva
who
received
percent
support
in
one
poll
even
though
he
can
not
run
due
to
a
graft
conviction
bolsonaro
s
strong
support
in
a
crowded
field
has
alarmed
moderate
politicians
and
unnerved
some
investors
but
with
brazil
slow
to
recover
from
its
most
painful
recession
in
decades
many
voters
believe
temer
s
government
has
ignored
the
hardships
of
ordinary
people
this
has
led
analysts
and
politicians
to
say
this
year
s
election
may
come
down
to
a
choice
between
the
far
left
and
the
far
right
during
the
strike
many
truckers
displayed
placards
expressing
support
for
bolsonaro
the
government
handled
this
strike
so
badly
said
lorivan
carvalho
a
federal
employee
who
spent
two
hours
waiting
in
a
line
of
cars
at
a
gas
station
in
brasilia
bolsonaro
gained
points
by
backing
the
the
protest
which
wound
down
this
week
after
temer
reintroduced
subsidies
demonstrated
the
unpopularity
of
temer
s
efforts
to
liberalize
latin
america
s
largest
economy
many
brazilians
tired
of
violent
crime
and
corruption
among
mainstream
parties
have
been
drawn
to
bolsonaro
s
hardline
pledges
for
instance
the
candidate
said
he
would
appoint
five
generals
to
his
cabinet
and
would
give
police
carte
blanche
to
kill
delinquents
who
shoot
at
them
brazil
has
some
deaths
a
year
congressman
major
olimpio
one
of
bolsonaro
s
campaign
managers
told
reuters
the
strike
was
a
vote
winner
for
his
candidate
who
had
emerged
as
the
only
credible
politician
whereas
temer
s
policies
were
blamed
for
the
crisis
if
no
candidate
wins
a
majority
in
the
first
round
a
runoff
between
the
two
leaders
will
be
held
on
even
political
rivals
conceded
that
bolsonaro
s
odds
are
improving
if
he
continues
with
this
level
of
support
and
the
centre
remains
divided
bolsonaro
could
reach
the
runoff
said
congressman
fabio
sousa
of
the
centrist
brazilian
social
democracy
party
psdb
bolsonaro
holds
nationalist
views
of
economic
development
of
the
kind
implemented
by
brazil
s
military
dictatorship
and
has
opposed
the
privatisation
of
state
companies
he
also
has
been
indicted
by
federal
prosecutors
on
hate
speech
charges
yet
in
an
overture
to
the
business
community
he
picked
investment
banker
paulo
guedes
as
his
economic
advisor
a
who
would
sell
off
everything
from
petrobras
to
state
banks
and
the
post
office
some
business
leaders
in
the
world
s
eighth
largest
economy
may
view
him
as
the
lesser
evil
if
he
is
in
a
runoff
with
the
leading
leftist
candidate
fiery
former
state
governor
ciro
gomes
the
market
likes
guedes
but
doubts
he
can
apply
his
ideas
in
a
bolsonaro
government
said
the
manager
of
a
brazilian
investment
fund
speaking
on
the
condition
he
was
not
identified
the
market
does
not
prefer
bolsonaro
but
might
have
to
accept
frustration
with
how
the
temer
government
handled
the
strike
added
to
popular
anger
at
a
political
establishment
discredited
by
graft
investigations
more
than
powerful
politicians
and
businessmen
are
now
behind
bars
the
truckers
protest
weakened
temer
more
than
anything
else
since
he
took
power
more
than
two
years
ago
following
the
impeachment
of
leftist
dilma
rousseff
temer
is
the
first
sitting
brazilian
president
to
be
charged
with
corruption
his
approval
ratings
have
sunk
to
around
percent
even
lower
than
that
of
president
nicolas
maduro
of
neighbouring
venezuela
hit
by
hyperinflation
and
food
shortages
this
has
dashed
hopes
that
temer
s
lame
duck
government
can
push
through
congress
business
friendly
measures
such
as
the
privatisation
of
brazil
s
largest
utility
centrais
eletricas
brasileiras
sa
known
as
eletrobras
that
was
a
already
a
tough
sell
now
it
becomes
almost
impossible
said
lucas
de
aragão
partner
at
the
political
consultancy
arko
advice
former
ceará
state
governor
ciro
gomes
has
emerged
as
the
most
likely
standard
bearer
for
brazil
s
left
with
just
under
percent
aragão
believes
many
voters
view
gomes
as
part
of
the
establishment
while
bolsonaro
will
gain
ground
from
the
truck
crisis
because
he
is
perceived
as
an
outsider
the
truckers
strike
knocked
down
the
last
pillar
of
hope
temer
s
government
had
of
electing
a
successor
that
will
continue
its
policies
said
rafael
cortez
chief
analyst
at
tendencias
consultancy
who
sees
little
chance
of
a
moderate
like
meirelles
winning
this
climate
of
radicalisation
benefits
the
extremes
