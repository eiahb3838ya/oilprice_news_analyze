mandatory evacuation ordered as hawaii eruption hits 4-week mark
honolulu
reuters
the
hawaii
community
hardest
hit
by
the
kilauea
volcano
was
ordered
sealed
off
under
a
strict
new
mandatory
evacuation
on
thursday
as
the
eruption
marked
its
fourth
week
with
no
end
in
sight
the
big
island
s
mayor
harry
kim
declared
a
roughly
swath
of
the
leilani
estates
subdivision
indefinitely
and
gave
any
residents
remaining
there
hours
to
leave
or
face
possible
arrest
the
mandatory
evacuation
zone
lies
within
a
slightly
larger
area
that
was
already
under
a
voluntary
evacuation
and
curfew
the
latest
order
was
announced
a
day
after
police
arrested
a
leilani
estates
resident
who
fired
a
handgun
over
the
head
of
a
younger
man
from
the
same
community
apparently
believing
his
neighbor
was
an
intruder
or
looter
the
confrontation
on
tuesday
was
recorded
on
cell
phone
video
that
later
went
viral
but
the
mandatory
evacuation
was
decided
prior
to
that
incident
said
david
mace
a
spokesman
for
the
federal
emergency
management
agency
currently
assigned
to
the
hawaii
county
civil
defense
authority
civil
defense
officials
have
previously
said
about
residents
in
and
around
leilani
estates
were
displaced
at
the
outset
of
the
current
eruption
which
began
on
may
but
the
total
number
of
evacuees
was
estimated
to
have
risen
to
about
after
authorities
ushered
residents
from
the
nearby
kapoho
area
as
a
precaution
on
wednesday
as
a
lava
flow
threatened
to
cut
off
a
key
access
road
at
least
homes
most
of
them
in
leilani
estates
have
been
devoured
by
streams
of
molten
rock
creeping
from
about
two
dozen
large
volcanic
vents
or
fissures
that
have
opened
in
the
ground
since
kilauea
rumbled
back
to
life
four
weeks
ago
lava
flows
also
have
knocked
out
power
and
telephone
lines
in
the
region
disrupting
communications
besides
spouting
fountains
of
lava
around
the
clock
the
fissures
have
released
high
levels
of
toxic
sulfur
dioxide
gas
on
a
near
constant
basis
posing
an
ongoing
health
hazard
meanwhile
the
main
summit
crater
has
periodically
erupted
in
clouds
of
volcanic
ash
that
create
breathing
difficulties
and
other
problems
for
residents
living
downwind
the
heightened
volcanic
activity
has
been
accompanied
by
frequent
earthquakes
as
magma
the
term
for
lava
before
it
reaches
the
surface
pushes
its
way
up
from
deep
inside
the
earth
and
exerts
tremendous
force
underground
after
a
month
of
continual
eruptions
at
kilauea
s
summit
and
along
its
eastern
flank
geologists
say
they
have
no
idea
how
much
longer
it
will
last
there
s
no
sign
we
re
getting
that
anything
is
going
to
slow
down
at
the
moment
wendy
stovl
a
vulcanologist
for
the
geological
survey
told
reporters
on
a
conference
call
on
thursday
we
don
t
see
any
changes
the
island
s
mayor
on
wednesday
renewed
an
emergency
proclamation
for
more
days
allowing
construction
of
temporary
shelters
and
other
relief
projects
to
proceed
on
an
expedited
basis
without
reviews
and
permits
normally
required
the
eruption
of
kilauea
one
of
the
world
s
most
active
volcanoes
followed
an
eruption
cycle
that
had
continued
almost
nonstop
for
years
stovall
said
geologists
now
believe
the
latest
upheaval
should
be
classified
as
a
separate
volcanic
event
though
an
official
determination
has
yet
to
be
made
