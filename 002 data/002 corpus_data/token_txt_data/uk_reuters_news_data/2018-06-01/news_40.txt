agl
energy
ltd
australia
s
biggest
power
producer
expects
to
make
a
final
investment
decision
on
the
country
s
first
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
import
terminal
in
the
financial
year
of
a
company
official
said
on
friday
the
a
million
million
project
will
consist
of
a
leased
floating
storage
and
regasification
unit
fsru
and
jetty
at
crib
point
in
the
southeastern
state
of
victoria
the
terminal
will
handle
up
to
to
petajoules
a
year
or
million
tonnes
of
lng
by
or
we
are
working
to
progress
the
project
to
a
final
investment
decision
in
the
financial
year
and
are
on
track
to
do
that
said
phaedra
deckart
general
manager
of
agl
s
energy
supply
and
origination
team
we
are
in
discussion
with
lng
suppliers
and
fsru
providers
on
the
other
components
to
the
agl
s
financial
year
runs
from
july
to
june
australia
is
set
to
become
the
world
s
top
exporter
of
lng
but
that
is
paradoxically
creating
a
shortage
at
home
as
gas
is
pulled
away
from
local
markets
in
the
southeast
agl
is
looking
to
fill
a
looming
gas
supply
shortfall
in
southeast
australia
and
break
the
grip
of
the
market
s
major
gas
suppliers
led
by
exxonmobil
corp
and
bhp
billiton
the
company
needs
gas
for
its
retail
customers
as
well
as
its
own
power
plants
it
depends
heavily
on
supply
from
the
gippsland
basin
joint
venture
owned
by
exxon
and
bhp
and
from
royal
dutch
shell
which
has
been
selling
gas
from
queensland
lng
imports
into
australia
could
provide
competition
to
the
gas
market
in
southern
australia
and
in
turn
cap
prices
deckart
said
australian
consumers
are
paying
at
times
more
and
higher
prices
than
the
lng
netback
prices
so
we
see
the
lng
imports
effectively
putting
a
cap
she
said
at
a
conference
organised
by
s
p
global
platts
in
singapore
it
doesn
t
mean
other
australian
supply
won
t
be
coming
to
the
market
in
australia
but
it
will
mean
it
can
t
come
to
the
market
at
a
price
higher
than
lng
import
the
company
could
also
import
additional
cargoes
if
there
are
any
unplanned
outages
capacity
constraint
or
if
there
is
a
security
of
supply
issue
