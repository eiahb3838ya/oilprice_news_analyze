fnsea
france
s
largest
farmers
union
on
thursday
called
for
the
nationwide
blockade
from

total
has
said
feedstock
for
the
tonnes
per
year

will
be
made
up
of
around
to

around

a
solid
business
case
for
the
biorefinery

would
continue
talks
with
farmers
and
had
decided
to
buy

sincerely
the

is
not
most
profitable

the
feedstock
that
will
go
into
the
refinery
he
said
france
consumes
around
million
tonnes
of
biodiesel
per
year
and
produces
about
percent
of
that
in
france
importing
the
rest
including
tonnes
from
southeast
asia
and
argentina
our
project
represents
around
tonnes
the
la
mede
refinery
project
will
make
france
a
lot
more
independent
