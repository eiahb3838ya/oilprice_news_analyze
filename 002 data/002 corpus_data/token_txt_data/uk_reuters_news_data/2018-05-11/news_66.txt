u.s. military seeks rules for drilling in eastern gulf of mexico
york
reuters
an
expansion
of
oil
drilling
in
the
eastern
gulf
of
mexico
would
interfere
with
military
testing
unless
the
pentagon
and
another
agency
develop
rules
to
govern
the
work
the
department
of
defense
said
in
a
report
this
week
the
defense
department
concluded
in
a
report
it
sent
on
wednesday
to
lawmakers
that
drilling
east
of
the
military
mission
line
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
a
demarcation
more
than
miles
km
west
of
florida
would
harm
military
testing
operations
without
the
rules
military
flexibility
in
the
region
would
be
lost
and
test
and
training
activities
would
be
severely
affected
without
mutually
agreed
restrictions
between
the
pentagon
and
the
interior
department
on
the
drilling
said
the
report
a
copy
of
which
was
seen
by
reuters
industry
groups
interpreted
the
report
with
optimism
the
report
confirmed
that
collaboration
between
the
department
of
defense
and
interior
will
enable
the
successful
coexistence
of
continued
military
training
and
expanded
american
oil
production
said
erik
milito
a
director
of
upstream
operations
at
the
american
petroleum
institute
randall
luthi
the
president
of
the
national
ocean
industries
association
said
the
report
showed
there
is
a
lot
of
ocean
out
there
and
while
there
will
be
devils
in
the
details
the
overall
message
from
the
pentagon
should
be
interpreted
as
cooperation
and
interest
in
drilling
offshore
in
the
united
states
is
high
as
the
trump
administration
pursues
a
policy
of
maximizing
oil
gas
and
coal
output
for
domestic
and
foreign
use
in
january
interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
said
the
administration
would
not
allow
drilling
off
florida
after
the
state
s
governor
protested
that
opening
it
up
would
harm
tourism
but
drilling
far
off
florida
is
still
in
play
the
departments
of
defense
and
interior
have
been
holding
meetings
on
drilling
in
the
region
that
are
likely
to
go
on
for
months
a
defense
department
spokeswoman
did
not
immediately
comment
on
whether
those
meetings
were
hammering
out
an
agreement
on
drilling
in
the
most
recent
gulf

mexico
auction
held
in

many
