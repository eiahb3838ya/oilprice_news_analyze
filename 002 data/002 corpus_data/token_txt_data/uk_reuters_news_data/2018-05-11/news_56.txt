insight-plastics mines? europe struggles as pollution piles up
oslo
reuters
europe
has
sent
just
over
half
the
plastic
waste
it
used
to
ship
to
china
to
other
parts
of
asia
since
beijing
s
environmental
crackdown
closed
the
world
s
biggest
recycling
market
in
january
the
knotty
problem
is
what
to
do
with
the
rest
some
of
the
surplus
is
piled
up
in
places
from
building
sites
to
ports
officials
say
waiting
for
new
markets
to
open
up
recycling
closer
to
home
is
held
back
by
the
fact
that
the
plastic
is
often
dirty
and
unsorted
the
same
reasons
china
turned
it
away
countries
led
by
malaysia
and
vietnam
and
india
imported
far
more
of
europe
s
plastic
waste
in
early
than
before
european
union
data
show
but
unless
they
or
others
take
more
the
only
options
will
be
to
either
bury
or
burn
it
in
an
overcrowded
continent
where
landfills
are
much
more
restricted
than
elsewhere
burning
is
the
obvious
option
to
help
generate
electricity
or
heat
from
hundreds
of
thousands
of
tonnes
of
surplus
waste
but
more
radical
ideas
such
as
putting
oil
derived
plastic
back
underground
to
mine
back
when
recycling
becomes
more
sophisticated
are
being
aired
as
europe
tries
to
work
out
what
to
do
european
waste
policies
need
to
become
much
more
nuanced
because
some
landfill
might
actually
be
quite
good
professor
ian
boyd
chief
scientific
adviser
for
the
british
government
s
department
of
environment
food
and
rural
affairs
told
reuters
i
m
putting
out
a
challenge
to
the
current
system
he
said
referring
to
the
fact
that
waste
policies
in
europe
either
ban
or
limit
landfill
but
do
little
to
restrict
what
has
been
dubbed
skyfill
the
release
of
pollutants
into
the
air
europe
has
favoured
the
construction
of
power
plants
that
burn
waste
for
electricity
or
heat
because
land
is
scarce
and
landfills
produce
toxins
and
greenhouse
gases
such
as
methane
as
organic
waste
from
food
to
nappies
rots
plants
produce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
too
but
in
most
of
europe
they
are
exempt
from
carbon
taxes
that
stand
at
about
euros
a
tonne
in
an
industrial
market
boyd
said
buried
plastic
could
become
a
valuable
resource
only
if
the
penalties
for
emitting
greenhouse
gases
both
in
making
plastics
and
burning
them
were
far
higher
than
today
globally
plastics
accounted
for
million
tonnes
of
carbon
dioxide
emissions
in
ranging
from
production
to
incineration
and
equivalent
to
the
emissions
by
a
nation
such
as
turkey
according
to
the
ellen
macarthur
foundation
a
that
specialises
in
recycling
the
plastics
industry
takes
issue
with
such
assessments
saying
they
ignore
the
vast
contribution
of
plastic
in
reducing
other
emissions
by
for
example
preserving
food
and
reducing
the
weight
of
transport
the
confederation
of
european
plants
cewep
a
group
of
some
plants
using
million
tonnes
of
municipal
waste
to
provide
heat
and
electricity
for
millions
of
people
said
burying
and
then
mining
back
plastic
was
a
fantasy
digging
waste
into
landfills
and
then
waiting
until
a
magic
technology
pops
up
in
the
future
is
not
a
responsible
option
cewep
managing
director
ellen
stengler
said
adding
that
the
idea
was
a
minority
view
she
heard
here
and
there
in
europe
just
cleaning
plastic
waste
before
burial
would
be
hugely
expensive
plastic
would
degrade
underground
and
there
would
be
risks
such
as
fire
she
said
the
latest
major
assessment
of
climate
change
in
also
floated
the
idea
that
cities
might
sort
and
bury
waste
such
as
metals
paper
and
plastics
to
create
a
material
reservoir
that
can
be
mined
sometime
in
future
plastic
pollution
is
surging
and
could
according
to
un
environment
exceed
the
weight
of
fish
in
the
oceans
by
china
which
used
to
process
half
the
world
s
exports
of
plastic
waste
has
insisted
on
higher
standards
of
cleanliness
and
sorting
to
prevent
waste
that
can
not
be
recycled
being
burnt
which
in
its
case
often
means
in
open
pits
for
europe
the
restrictions
have
so
far
acted
as
an
effective
ban
according
to
official
data
reviewed
by
reuters
which
showed
exports
to
china
crashing
by
percent
in
the
first
two
months
of
the
year
for
graphic
click
nations
led
by
malaysia
vietnam
turkey
india
and
indonesia
took
on
around
percent
of
the
waste
but
the
surplus
means
europe
s
market
for
waste
has
collapsed
a
tonne
of
plastic
waste
for
export
with
up
to
percent
impurities
such
as
paper
labels
could
be
sold
for
between
and
pounds
a
tonne
in
april
according
to
british
recycling
group
last
month
by
contrast
you
had
to
pay
between
and
pounds
to
get
someone
to
take
it
away
despite
this
patawari
borad
of
the
bureau
of
international
recycling
in
brussels
said
recycling
within
europe
had
not
increased
dramatically
one
can
only
guess
that
this
unsorted
material
is
going
for
either
energy
or
body
cewep
said
it
saw
no
sign
extra
plastic
was
being
burnt
incinerators
would
notice
a
higher
share
of
plastics
stengler
said
because
tonne
for
tonne
they
produce
a
lot
of
energy
proponents
of
the
idea
of
burying
plastic
include
keith
freegard
a
director
of
axion
polymers
in
england
one
of
europe
s
leading
recyclers
of
waste
from
cars
and
electronics
all
those
tonnes
of
waste
material
that
were
going
into
the
landfill
are
now
being
released
into
the
sky
why
are
we
allowing
this
free
access
to
skyfill
said
freegard
who
is
vice
chair
of
the
british
plastic
federation
s
recycling
group
we
should
separate
and
store
plastic
in
a
landfill
as
a
future
mine
he
told
reuters
to
produce
a
megawatt
hour
of
electricity
he
said
a
plant
would
need
to
burn
kg
of
plastic
emitting
kg
of
carbon
dioxide
by
contrast
a
power
plant
would
generate
the
same
amount
of
energy
by
burning
kg
of
natural
gas
emitting
just
kg
of
carbon
dioxide
stengler
and
nations
that
favour
plants
say
such
accounting
is
misleading
and
that
helps
replace
fossil
fuels
a
key
goal
of
the
paris
climate
agreement
to
limit
heat
waves
floods
droughts
and
rising
seas
swedish
government
estimates
for
instance
show
that
three
tonnes
of
municipal
waste
contain
as
much
energy
as
a
tonne
of
oil
world
production
of
plastics
has
increased
about
twentyfold
since
the
and
is
expected
to
double
again
over
the
next
years
according
to
the
european
commission
erik
solheim
head
of
environment
in
nairobi
said
the
global
focus
for
plastic
policies
should
be
to
cut
use
especially
products
such
as
microplastics
used
in
some
cosmetics
or
drinking
straws
that
he
said
were
unnecessary
the
best
of
all
is
to
avoid
the
plastics
we
don
t
need
he
said
burying
waste
and
mining
it
sounds
a
difficult
option
of
million
tonnes
of
plastic
waste
collected
in
europe
in
percent
went
to
energy
generation
percent
to
recycling
including
in
china
and
percent
to
landfills
according
to
plastics
europe
it
was
the
first
time
that
recycling
rates
exceeded
landfills
it
said
by
contrast
in
the
more
spacious
united
states
percent
of
million
tonnes
of
collected
plastics
was
landfilled
in
according
to
the
environmental
protection
agency
fifteen
percent
was
burnt
and
percent
recycled
it
said
and
worldwide
a
report
by
scientists
in
estimated
that
only
about
percent
of
municipal
solid
waste
is
recycled
about
percent
used
to
generate
energy
and
the
rest
dumped
