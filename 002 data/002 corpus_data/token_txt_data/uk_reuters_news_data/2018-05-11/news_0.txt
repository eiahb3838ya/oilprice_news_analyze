exclusive-pdvsa to shut curacao refinery amid fight with conoco -sources
reuters
venezuela
s
oil
company
pdvsa
is
preparing
to
shut
a
caribbean
refinery
that
is
running
out
of
crude
amid
threats
by
conocophillips
to
seize
cargoes
sent
to
resupply
the
facility
according
to
two
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
situation
conoco
of
the
united
states
last
week
began
legal
actions
in
the
caribbean
to
enforce
a
billion
arbitration
award
by
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
icc
over
the
nationalisation
of
its
projects
in
venezuela
the
moves
have
disrupted
fuel
deliveries
throughout
the
caribbean
much
of
which
depends
on
pdvsa
the
isla
refinery
in
curacao
which
has
not
received
new
shipments
from
pdvsa
since
last
week
plans
to
exhaust
existing
inventories
in
the
coming
days
the
two
sources
said
pdvsa
did
not
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
pdvsa
is
seeking
ways
to
sidestep
legal
orders
to
hand
over
assets
the
venezuelan
firm
has
transferred
custody
over
the
fuel
produced
at
the
refinery
to
the
curacao
government
the
owner
of
the
facility
the
sources
said
in
another
legal
move
to
avoid
oil
being
seized
pdvsa
transferred
ownership
of
crude
to
be
refined
at
isla
to
its
unit
citgo
petroleum
one
of
the
sources
added
the
seizure
in
curacao
was
enforced
on
thursday
so
the
inventories
custody
was
transferred
the
refinery
will
eventually
stop
operations
the
source
said
pdvsa
has
told
customers
they
must
send
their
own
ships
to
pick
up
oil
cargoes
in
venezuelan
waters
rather
than
wait
for
it
to
deliver
that
keeps
pdvsa
s
ships
out
of
conoco
s
grasp
pdvsa
which
was
already
struggling
to
export
its
oil
amid
falling
output
and
a
lack
of
maintenance
is
looking
for
a
place
in
venezuelan
waters
to
start
transferring
oil
from
small
to
larger
tankers
which
is
typically
done
for
large
cargoes
bound
for
asian
destinations
the
country
s
oil
ports
increasingly
are
snarled
with
vessels
waiting
to
load
for
exports
conoco
said
on
friday
that
it
had
been
in
touch
with
local
officials
across
the
caribbean
to
address
issues
that
may
arise
as
a
result
of
enforcement
curacao
fuel
distributor
curoil
told
reuters
on
friday
the
company
has
diversified
its
fuel
supply
so
it
does
not
foresee
any
issues
at
the
moment
the
island
s
prime
minister
eugene
rhuggenaath
earlier
this
week
said
curacao
would
import
fuel
if
the
refinery
is
paralysed
in
bonaire
another
of
the
islands
affected
by
conoco
s
actions
there
is
enough
fuel
to
continue
generating
electricity
for
at
least
two
weeks
said
caspar
itz
a
spokesman
for
the
dutch
ministry
of
economic
affairs
pdvsa
last
year
shipped
from
the
terminals
it
owns
and
rents
in
curacao
bonaire
and
eustatius
percent
of
its
total
exports
or
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
facilities
in
curacao
are
crucial
for
loading
big
vessels
bound
for
china
and
india
while
most
of
its
fuel
oil
exports
are
sent
from
bonaire
for
may
pdvsa
had
planned
to
ship
from
curacao
million
barrels
bpd
of
fuels
to
haiti
cuba
el
salvador
nicaragua
belize
and
other
smaller
caribbean
islands
according
to
the
firm
s
internal
trade
documents
pdvsa
also
planned
to
deliver
this
month
over
million
barrels
of
crude
and
fuel
oil
to
citgo
and
russia
s
rosneft
from
curacao
and
bonaire
the
documents
showed
in
its
first
official
comments
since
conoco
s
actions
started
venezuela
on
thursday
suggested
it
was
ready
to
pay
the
oil
company
conoco
said
it
was
looking
forward
to
pdvsa
s
proposals
but
added
that
absent
any
agreement
or
payment
it
would
continue
its
enforcement
actions
