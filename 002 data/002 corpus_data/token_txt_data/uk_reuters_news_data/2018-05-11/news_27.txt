in
early
petrofac
became
the
first
foreign
company
for
more
than
years
to
operate
state
oil
fields
in
mexico
when
it
was
awarded
two
integrated

contracts
by
petróleos
mexicanos
pemex
mexico
s
national
oil
company

million
million
pounds
at
the
end
of
below
the
million
it
forecast
it
reported
a
net
loss
of
million
for
the
year
oilfield
service
companies
had
been
hurt
by
weak
demand
as
recent
subdued
oil
prices
forced
explorers
and
producers
to
cut
capital
expenditure
and
defer
or
cancel
contracts
alongside
oil
producers
companies
that
drill
wells
haul
water
and
provide
other
services
to
energy
exploration
firms
had
been
hit
by
a
slump
in
oil
prices
with
benchmark
brent
tumbling
to
about
a
barrel
in
from
more
than
in
it
is
now
trading
at
in
recent
months
oil
firms
have
returned
to
profits
due
to
higher
oil
prices
and
the
benefits
of
deep
cost
cuts
they
made
during
the
downturn
but
their
suppliers
are
still
feeling
the
squeeze
and
trying
to
cope
with
low
profitability
this
has
led
to
a
wave
of
consolidation
in
the
sector
with
the
merger
of
france
s
technip
and
rival
fmc
technologies
and
the
acquisition
of
