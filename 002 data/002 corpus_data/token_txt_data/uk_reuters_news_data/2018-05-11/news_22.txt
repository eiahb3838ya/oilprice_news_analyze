germany
has
proposed
setting
up
some
sort
of
consortium
to
ensure
that
ukraine
retains
its
role
as
a
transit
country
for
russian
gas
once
the
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
is
operational
german
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
made
the
proposal
without
giving
details
during
a
meeting
on
friday
with
his
counterparts
from
baltic
countries
which
oppose
the
pipeline
germany
has
backed
nord
stream
which
will
run
from
russia
to
germany
through
the
baltic
sea
but
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
last
month
that
the
project
can
not
go
ahead
without
clarity
on
ukraine
s
role
as
a
transit
route
for
gas
we
are
making
intensive
efforts
to
allow
the
transit
of
gas
through
ukraine
in
the
future
maas
said
after
meeting
the
foreign
ministers
of
lithuania
estonia
and
latvia
in
lithuania
we
are
considering
setting
up
a
consortium
to
ensure
that
that
is
the
case
he
said
but
did
not
elaborate
an
initiative
of
russia
s
gazprom
and
five
european
companies
the
new
pipeline
on
the
baltic
seabed
would
double
russia
s
export
capacity
to
germany
baltic
states
fear
the
pipeline
could
increase
reliance
on
russian
gas
and
undermine
ukraine
s
role
as
a
gas
transit
route
which
provides
valuable
revenues
to
the
country
that
saw
its
crimean
peninsula
annexed
by
russia
it
is
very
important
that
no
such
project
would
give
any
gas
supplier
greater
leverage
over
european
union
policies
estonia
s
foreign
affairs
minister
sven
mikser
said
maas
s
comments
will
do
little
to
assuage
public
concerns
in
the
three
baltic
countries
once
ruled
by
their
giant
eastern
neighbour
but
now
part
of
the
european
union
and
nato
we
consider
this
project
very
much
out
of
line
with
the
eu
s
energy
policy
and
quite
detrimental
to
ukraine
said
lithuanian
foreign
minister
linas
linkevicius
we
believe
it
is
not
a
purely
economical
project
it
has
a
political
poland
also
opposes
the
pipeline
which
would
cost
kiev
valuable
transit
income
and
could
make
it
easier
for
russia
to
cut
supplies
to
countries
without
inconveniencing
germany
its
biggest
customer
this
week
poland
s
office
launched
proceedings
against
the
developers
of
nord
stream
saying
the
project
raised
competition
concerns
maas
ruled
out
any
increase
in
his
country
s
military
involvement
in
the
baltic
region
where
germany
leads
a
deployment
of
about
nato
troops
one
of
four
such
battle
groups
designed
to
deter
russia
from
meddling
in
the
region
for
the
time
being
it
will
not
be
possible
for
us
to
enhance
troop
numbers
here
