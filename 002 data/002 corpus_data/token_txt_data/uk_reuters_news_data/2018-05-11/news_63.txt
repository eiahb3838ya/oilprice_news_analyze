armers
everywhere
know
water
means
life
and
a
lack
of
it
can
spell
ruin
in
hojancha
a
canton
that
lies
about
kilometres
miles
west
of
the
costa
rican
capital
san
jose
cattle
farmer
manuel
rojas
understands
that
as
well
as
anyone
normally
by
this
time
of
year
he
said
his
small
herd
of
cattle
would
be
desperate
for
water
not
any
longer
now
they
have
it
there
easily
he
said
pointing
to
a
full
drinking
trough
what
changed
last
month
rojas
installed
a
rainwater
harvest
system
that
as
the
name
suggests
captures
rainwater
and
stores
it
in
an
tank
it
is
one
of
the
country
s
first
such
systems
its
inverted
pyramid
structure
stores
million
litres
of
water
enough
to
last
four
months
if
used
carefully
we
hope
that
this
system
can
help
us
maintain
production
throughout
the
whole
year
and
not
only
when
it
rains
he
said
hojancha
lies
in
guanacaste
province
a
region
on
the
pacific
coast
that
is
particularly
prone
to
drought
especially
during
the
intense
summer
months
this
area
has
few
rivers
said
oscar
vasquez
the
provincial
director
at
the
ministry
of
agriculture
who
was
at
rojas
farm
for
a
ceremony
marking
the
system
s
installation
i
do
not
see
another
way
than
this
water
comes
only
from
the
sky
he
said
despite
the
need
for
it
though
capturing
rain
is
in
its
infancy
in
costa
rica
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
part
because
people
do
not
know
about
the
technology
but
there
are
other
reasons
vasquez
said
it
is
costly
to
set
up
and
there
is
not
enough
clarity
about
the
law
covering
rainwater
harvesting
both
factors
lower
the
economic
incentives
for
farmers
to
invest
a
system
like
the
one
rojas
installed
costs
about
a
sum
that
in
practice
is
unaffordable
for
farmers
like
him
it
consists
of
a
network
of
gutters
that
captures
rain
from
the
roof
of
his
barn
and
directs
it
to
the
tank
from
there
a
pump
distributes
it
to
the
troughs
an
irrigation
system
for
grazing
and
another
that
cleans
the
barn
housing
the
cattle
rojas
s
system
was
financed
through
the
mexican
agency
for
international
development
cooperation
with
the
united
nations
food
and
agriculture
organization
fao
helping
to
design
and
install
it
fao
programme
assistant
diego
fallas
said
it
is
hard
for
farmers
to
get
financing
for
green
solutions
like
rainwater
harvesting
as
the
existence
of
such
systems
is
largely
unknown
access
to
green
financing
is
important
for
example
these
are
actions
that
adapt
producers
to
climate
change
and
green
financing
should
make
this
type
of
technology
more
accessible
to
producers
fallas
said
the
fao
wants
to
encourage
more
farmers
in
the
guanacaste
region
to
consider
rainwater
harvesting
said
octavio
ramirez
fao
country
head
during
the
ceremony
at
rojas
farm
doing
so
would
help
farmers
deal
with
the
effects
of
climate
change
said
fallas
by
creating
a
water
reserve
to
supply
their
farm
s
needs
during
drought
the
fao
focuses
on
guanacaste
because
it
lies
in
central
america
s
dry
corridor
one
of
the
regions
whose
agriculture
the
agency
regards
as
being
more
vulnerable
to
rising
temperatures
the
area
is
also
exposed
to
extreme
events
such
as
el
nino
said
hydrologist
alejandra
rojas
who
is
not
related
to
manuel
rojas
from
the
university
of
costa
rica
the
last
el
nino
which
hit
costa
rica
s
typically
dry
northern
and
central
regions
in
caused
losses
of
more
than
billion
costa
rican
colon
million
to
agriculture
and
livestock
government
figures
show
so
while
rainwater
harvesting
will
help
farmers
deal
with
the
effects
of
climate
change
and
lower
the
stress
on
aquifers
it
will
take
much
more
than
that
to
minimise
the
effects
of
extreme
weather
events
she
said
what
happens
a
lot
of
the
time
is
that
the
system
goes
into
a
hydrological
drought
in
other
words
there
is
a
decrease
in
all
water
sources
both
rain
and
reservoirs
as
well
as
aquifers
rojas
said
dealing
successfully
with
those
types
of
situations
needs
more
including
setting
up
habits
and
using
drip
irrigation
and
although
nature
is
beyond
the
government
s
control
fixing
regulations
around
rainwater
harvesting
is
not
both
the
ministry
s
vasquez
and
fallas
from
the
fao
said
a
lack
of
clear
rules
is
holding
back
the
spread
of
rainwater
harvesting
regulations
about
water
use
have
long
been
complex
in
costa
rica
farmers
for
instance
must
get
permits
if
they
want
to
use
rainwater
once
it
has
landed
on
the
country
s
soil
and
until
last
year
they
also
needed
a
permit
to
capture
rainwater
from
their
own
roofs
that
changed
after
an
executive
order
was
issued
allowing
farmers
to
store
up
to
cubic
metres
of
rainwater
without
permission
said
fallas
water
that
has
not
touched
national
soil
can
still
be
used
without
any
permits
fallas
explained
that
remains
true
for
now
however
as
the
executive
order
expires
next
year
it
is
unclear
what
will
happen
then
the
complications
do
not
end
there
regulations
around
water
storage
are
also
complex
fallas
said
as
they
involve
strict
construction
rules
that
can
take
two
years
to
complete
a
lengthy
costly
process
that
many
farmers
can
not
afford
patricia
quiros
general
manager
of
the
government
s
national
service
of
groundwater
irrigation
and
drainage
senara
said
local
authorities
could
help
by
including
rules
on
rainwater
harvesting
in
their
regulations
on
land
use
they
could
do
the
same
by
devising
local
regulations
on
building
storage
systems
she
said
cutting
both
the
amount
of
red
tape
and
the
time
farmers
need
to
spend
on
securing
water
the
fao
s
fallas
said
time
is
of
the
essence
we
must
take
the
issues
on
the
table
and
start
working
together
because
the
ones
suffering
right
now
are
the
producers
the
agriculture
and
livestock
sector
is
being
harmed
