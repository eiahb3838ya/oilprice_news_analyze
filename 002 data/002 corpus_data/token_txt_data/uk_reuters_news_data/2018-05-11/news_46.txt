china
s
energy
major
cnpc
is
ready
to
take
over
total
s
stake
in
the
giant
iranian
south
pars
gas
project
if
the
french
company
leaves
amid
newly
announced
sanctions
industry
sources
said
the
united
states
this
week
said
it
would
impose
new
sanctions
against
major
oil
and
gas
producer
iran
after
abandoning
an
agreement
reached
in
late
that
limited
tehran
s
nuclear
ambitions
in
exchange
for
sanctions
relief
while
the
new
sanctions
are
unilateral
many
companies
including
japan
s
inpex
already
appear
to
be
bowing
to
washington
s
pressure
and
abandoning
projects
in
iran
if
total
walks
away
from
the
south
pars
field
which
has
the
world
s
biggest
natural
gas
reserves
ever
found
in
one
place
cnpc
is
prepared
to
step
in
the
sources
said
it
was
not
clear
whether
cnpc
had
received
top
government
approval
to
do
so
but
such
a
move
could
further
strain
the
tense
trade
relationship
between
beijing
and
washington
reuters
reported
in
december
that
a
billion
deal
signed
last
july
gave
the
chinese
firm
the
option
to
take
over
total
s
stake
if
it
left
iran
since
then
the
giant
has
conducted
significant
due
diligence
and
planning
several
industry
sources
told
reuters
the
possibility
of
total
s
pullout
is
quite
high
now
and
in
that
scenario
cnpc
will
be
ready
to
take
it
over
fully
said
a
senior
state
oil
official
with
knowledge
of
the
contract
an
executive
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
project
added
that
planning
began
the
day
the
investment
was
cnpc
foresaw
a
high
probability
of
a
reimposition
of
sanctions
the
executive
said
all
the
sources
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
they
were
not
authorized
to
speak
to
media
under
the
terms
of
the
agreement
to
develop
phase
of
south
pars
cnpc
could
take
over
total
s
percent
stake
and
become
operator
of
the
project
cnpc
already
holds
a
percent
stake
in
the
field
while
iranian
national
oil
company
subsidiary
petropars
holds
the
remaining
percent
so
far
the
chinese
oil
giant
which
already
operates
two
oil
fields
in
iran
has
spent
about
million
on
planning
to
develop
the
field
the
sources
said
despite
cnpc
s
preparations
the
two
sources
said
they
were
not
aware
of
any
meetings
between
total
and
cnpc
after
trump
s
move
cnpc
and
total
declined
to
comment
a
source
close
to
total
said
the
french
company
was
analysing
the
impact
of
new
sanctions
and
whether
it
could
get
a
waiver
that
would
allow
it
to
keep
its
stake
an
experienced
onshore
oil
and
gas
producer
cnpc
is
relatively
green
in
offshore
drilling
most
of
its
experience
lies
in
its
subsidiary
china
petroleum
offshore
engineering
company
cpoe
which
has
worked
in
shallow
waters
off
north
china
the
south
pars
gas
reservoirs
are
buried
beneath
the
seafloor
metres
underwater
the
project
will
have
a
production
capacity
of
billion
cubic
feet
per
day
or
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
including
condensate
total
has
said
at
current
market
prices
the
whole
reserves
of
the
field
which
iran
shares
with
qatar
would
be
worth
around
trillion
the
field
is
set
to
start
supplying
the
iranian
domestic
market
in
cnpc
is
prepared
to
use
its
banking
unit
bank
of
kunlun
ltd
as
a
funding
and
clearing
vehicle
if
it
takes
over
operation
of
south
pars
the
second
senior
state
oil
official
said
the
bank
was
used
to
settle
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
oil
imports
during
the
un
sanctions
against
tehran
between
and
the
official
added
most
of
the
bank
s
settlements
during
that
time
were
in
euros
and
chinese
renminbi
the
treasury
sanctioned
kunlun
in
for
conducting
business
with
iran
if
cnpc
goes
ahead
it
would
also
likely
have
to
develop
crucial
equipment
such
as
compressors
needed
for
developing
gas
deposits
on
this
scale
on
its
own
leading
manufacturers
like
firm
ge
and
germany
s
siemens
could
be
barred
from
supplying
to
iran
under
sanctions
