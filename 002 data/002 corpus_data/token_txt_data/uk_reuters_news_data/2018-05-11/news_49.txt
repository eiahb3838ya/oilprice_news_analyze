bombers
and
fighter
jets
from
china
s
air
force
conducted
encirclement
drills
around
taiwan
on
friday
the
latest
round
of
increasingly
frequent
military
manoeuvres
near
the
island
that
taipei
has
denounced
as
intimidation
china
claims
taiwan
as
its
sacred
territory
and
its
hostility
towards
the
island
has
grown
since
the
election
of
president
tsai
from
the
democratic
progressive
party
in
the
past
year
beijing
has
stepped
up
such
military
exercises
designed
to
send
a
message
to
taiwan
that
it
will
thwart
what
it
sees
as
any
moves
towards
independence
even
as
tsai
has
pledged
to
maintain
the
status
quo
and
keep
the
peace
the
people
s
liberation
army
air
force
said
in
a
statement
on
its
official
microblog
that
bombers
and
surveillance
aircraft
flew
in
opposite
directions
around
taiwan
displaying
a
new
upgrade
in
combat
capabilities
it
said
it
was
the
first
time
fighter
jets
had
flown
with
the
bombers
through
the
bashi
channel
which
separates
taiwan
from
the
philippines
china
is
in
the
midst
of
an
ambitious
programme
to
modernise
its
armed
forces
developing
stealth
fighters
aircraft
carriers
and
advanced
missiles
as
it
strives
to
acquire
a
military
by
the
middle
of
the
century
that
goal
coupled
with
an
increasingly
assertive
stance
in
the
disputed
south
china
sea
waterway
and
around
taiwan
has
rattled
nerves
around
the
region
and
in
washington
taiwan
is
well
equipped
with
mostly
weaponry
but
has
been
pushing
for
washington
to
sell
it
more
advanced
equipment
including
new
fighter
jets
to
help
it
better
deter
its
giant
neighbour
military
experts
say
the
balance
of
power
between
taiwan
and
china
has
now
shifted
decisively
in
favour
of
china
which
could
probably
overwhelm
the
island
unless
forces
came
quickly
to
its
aid
