fiat
chrysler
automobiles
nv
chief
executive
sergio
marchionne
said
on
friday
proposed
changes
to
automotive
rules
by
the
government
may
prompt
the
automaker
to
shift
exports
of
the
company
s
vehicles
marchionne
told
reuters
that
changes
planned
for
automotive
rules
under
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
by
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
were
directionally
correct
but
we
re
not
the
revised
agreement
would
not
threaten
the
automaker
s
mexican
production
he
said
i
think
we
have
to
redirect
the
mexican
production
to
a
global
market
marchionne
said
i
think
there
are
things
we
can
do
but
it
s
part
of
a
ahead
of
an
industry
meeting
with
trump
and
major
automakers
marchionne
said
he
supported
white
house
efforts
to
revise
vehicle
rules
to
account
for
a
shift
in
buying
habits
towards
larger
vehicles
and
hoped
for
an
agreed
way
epa
chief
scott
pruitt
has
said
standards
on
model
year
to
vehicles
should
be
revised
reversing
a
decision
on
tighter
standards
by
the
obama
administration
in
january
but
environmental
and
health
advocates
say
emissions
standards
should
remain
stricter
citing
the
risks
to
health
the
environment
and
climate
from
looser
emissions
regulations
seventeen
states
have
mounted
a
legal
challenge
to
the
trump
administration
s
decision
to
revise
emission
and
rules
marchionne
was
fully
supportive
of
trump
s
efforts
to
try
to
get
this
reexamined
in
view
of
the
changing
circumstances
he
said
in
one
of
two
brief
interviews
he
said
he
still
hoped
the
administration
could
reach
a
deal
with
california
to
maintain
nationwide
emissions
standards
trump
is
probably
the
most
consummate
deal
maker
i
ve
seen
in
a
long
long
time
said
marchionne
while
characterizing
the
obama
administration
s
effort
to
a
review
of
whether
standards
through
were
appropriate
as
he
said
the
industry
would
continue
to
improve
vehicle
efficiency
and
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
no
matter
how
the
rules
change
we
shouldn
t
become
sort
of
poster
children
of
a
cause
here
