npower
will
raise
domestic

for
one
million
british
customers
saying
its
standard
variable
dual
fuel
price
for
gas
and
electricity
would
increase
percent
from
friday
s
price
rise
announcement
comes
despite
intense
political
scrutiny
of
energy
bills
and
follows
hikes
by
british

npower
s
price
rise
means
customers
on
its
dual
fuel
tariff
who
pay
by
direct
debit
will
have
an
average
energy
bill
of
around
pounds
a
year
the
rise
is
made
up
of
an
average
rise
of
percent
on
gas
and
percent
on
electricity
npower
said
in
a
statement
the
price
change
largely
stems
from
increases
in
policy
and
wholesale
energy
costs
which
are
widely
acknowledged
to
have
continued
to
rise
since
npower
implemented
its
last
price
change
in
march
it
added
british
gas
prices
trgbnbpwkd
have
become
more
volatile
and
experienced
a
huge
spike
during
a
sudden
freeze
in
late
february
in
part
due
to
the
closure
of
a
large
storage
site
which
acted
as
buffer
during
cold
months
baseload
power
prices
are
broadly
higher
this
month
than
a
year
ago
too
but
the
wholesale
price
constitutes
less
then
half
of
retail
prices
other
charges
some

encourage
a
switch
to
renewable

make
up
the
rest
britain
s
dominant
energy
companies
which
also
include

sse
plc
face
price
caps
on
the
standard
variable
tariffs
which
the
government
plans
to
implement
in
time
for
winter
as
well
as
fierce
competition
from
smaller
rivals
the
government
has
said
british
energy
prices
are
a
after
it
emerged
household
bills
have
doubled
over
the
last
decade
despite
a
series
of

liberalisation
reforms
