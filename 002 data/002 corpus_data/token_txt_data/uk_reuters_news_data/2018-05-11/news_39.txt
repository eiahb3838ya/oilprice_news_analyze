for
sri

ceylon
petroleum
corporation
cpc
the
head
of
the
fuel
retailer
said
on
friday
sri
lanka
has
a
single
bpd
oil
refinery
in
colombo
suburb
sapugaskanda
built
originally
to
refine
iranian
light
crude
however
when
toughened
sanctions
were
imposed
on
tehran
in
to
curb
its
nuclear
ambitions
cpc
was
forced
to
look
for
other
light
crudes
cpc
chairman
dammika
ranatunga
said
the
fuel
retailer
is
looking
for
a
partner
to
build
a
bpd
refinery
on
a
bot
basis
it
is
going
to
cost
anything
between
billion
and
billion
ranatunga
told
reuters
in
an
interview
a
chinese
firm
two
middle
eastern
companies
and
a
russian
company
have
all
expressed
interest
to
invest
in
the
new
refinery
ranatunga
declined
to
name
the
potential
investors
but
said
the
discussions
are
in
a
preliminary
stage
ranatunga
said
a
bpd
refinery
could
knock
million
a
year
off
of
sri
lanka
s
import
bill
for
refined
fuels
the
country
spent
billion
on
fuel
imports
in
investors
would
have
the
option
of
building
a
refinery
with
a
capacity
greater
than
bpd
and
exporting
any
excess
refined
fuels
he
said
sri
lanka
had
earlier
planned
to
upgrade
its
sole
refinery
which
accounts
for
percent
of
the
country
s
fuel
requirement
and
double
its
capacity
to
boost
output
and
reduce
the
cost
of
importing
refined
fuels
upgrading
the
refinery
may
not
be
the
solution
it
is
important
for
us
to
refine
all
types
of
crude
that
is
the
way
we
can
get
crude
at
a
competitive
price
ranatunga
russia
s
energy
ministry
said
in
march
its
officials
have
discussed
an
oil
refinery
project
in
sri
lanka
two
chinese
companies
have
jointly
bid
for
a
separate
bpd
refinery
with
an
annual
output
of
around
million
tonnes
a
year
or
bpd
in
the
southern
town
of
hambantota
near
an
important
shipping
route
where
china
controls
a
sea
port
and
plans
an
industrial
zone
sri
lanka
is
still
in
discussion
on
the
hambantota
refinery
although
the
government
has
blocked
a
proposal
by
the
chinese
companies
bidding
on
the
refinery
there
to
sell
fuel
locally
sri
lanka
has
also
discussed
another
bpd
refinery
in
partnership
with
indian
oil
corp
but
there
has
been
on
progress
on
that
plan
