china
s
jiangsu
province
is
considering
shutting
small
coke
plants
along
the
yangtze
river
and
near
lake
tai
as
the
eastern
province
steps
up
its
campaign
against
pollution
an
official
at
the
provincial
government
familiar
with
the
matter
said
the
move
is
part
of
a
broader
proposal
being
considered
by
the
provincial
government
said
the
official
who
declined
to
be
named
as
he
is
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
media
jiangsu
province
is
china
s
steel
producing
region
and
its
output
of
coke
used
to
smelt
iron
ore
in
blast
furnaces
accounts
for
percent
of
the
country
s
total
on
average
local
officials
in
the
eastern
province
have
become
more
aggressive
in
tackling
pollution
with
a
flurry
of
chemical
plant
and
steel
mill
closures
in
recent
weeks
coke
futures
prices
jumped
more
than
percent
on
friday
to
yuan
per
tonne
as
investors
bet
that
the
proposal
will
reduce
coke
supplies
two
traders
said
the
latest
proposal
is
likely
to
increase
costs
for
steel
mills
bringing
in
coke
from
elsewhere
could
also
add
to
pressure
on
the
country
s
rail
system
after
china
cracked
down
on
diesel
trucks
carrying
bulk
commodities
in
many
regions
it
is
not
known
when
the
authorities
will
make
a
final
decision
