london
reuters
european
oil
companies
are
not
ruling
out
reducing
iranian
oil
imports
after
the
threat
of
new
sanctions
with
some
expecting
banking
issues
to
hinder
trade
but
there
was
no
rush
to
immediately
cut
volumes
president
donald
trump
said
on
tuesday
the
united
states
was
exiting
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
and
would
impose
new
sanctions
that
seek
to
reduce
oil
exports
from
opec
s
producer
but
as
of
friday
companies
in
europe
said
they
were
still
taking
iranian
oil
iran
pumps
about
percent
of
the
world
s
oil
and
exports
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
to
europe
according
to
data
at
this
moment
our
trading
activity
is
business
as
usual
said
marta
llorente
a
spokeswoman
for
spanish
oil
company
cepsa
one
of
iran
s
customers
in
europe
we
strictly
conform
with
european
union
and
international
laws
and
regulations
and
scrupulously
respect
any
trade
restriction
that
could
occur
from
any
potential
international
sanctions
or
another
european
buyer
italy
s
eni
said
it
is
buying
million
barrels
a
month
of
iranian
crude
as
part
of
a
contract
running
to
adding
any
new
sanctions
would
take
six
months
to
kick
in
the
sanctions
have
a
period
during
which
buyers
should
wind
down
oil
purchases
meaning
any
loss
of
supply
will
not
be
immediately
felt
and
companies
don
t
have
to
rush
to
find
alternatives
but
greece
s
biggest
oil
refiner
hellenic
which
was
the
first
european
company
to
agree
to
buy
crude
oil
from
the
national
iranian
oil
company
nioc
after
sanctions
on
iran
were
lifted
in
january
rang
a
cautious
note
we
are
closely
monitoring
developments
following
the
administration
decision
and
will
assess
our
position
and
commercial
arrangements
accordingly
hellenic
said
in
any
case
we
will
make
sure
that
we
comply
with
the
applicable
international
regulatory
framework
and
given
our
crude
supply
flexibility
and
diversification
we
do
not
expect
any
significant
effect
on
our
the
bulk
of
iran
s
crude
exports
about
million
bpd
go
to
asia
a
decline
in
volumes
due
to
the
sanctions
will
add
to
upward
pressure
on
oil
prices
which
have
gained
this
year
because
of
an
supply
cutting
deal
and
strong
global
demand
crude
has
topped
a
barrel
the
highest
since
following
trump
s
sanctions
announcement
market
participants
said
there
were
still
many
unanswered
questions
about
how
the
united
states
might
impact
european
companies
we
re
doing
nothing
said
the
head
of
trading
at
another
european
refiner
it
s
wait
and
see
if
we
re
forced
to
reduce
we
will
iranian
is
not
the
only
sources
at
global
trading
companies
predicted
an
imminent
drop
in
iranian
exports
due
to
banking
issues
such
as
availability
of
trade
finance
a
source
at
a
trading
company
buying
iranian
oil
said
it
hoped
to
keep
buying
at
least
during
the
wind
down
period
before
new
sanctions
take
effect
but
expected
banking
issues
to
put
a
stop
to
trade
it
looks
like
you
can
still
go
on
for
six
months
the
source
who
declined
to
be
identified
said
the
key
is
banks
if
banks
stop
us
we
might
a
senior
trader
with
another
company
said
he
expected
banking
to
pose
a
major
problem
to
iranian
oil
trade
and
a
third
said
even
if
waivers
are
granted
volumes
would
still
decline
waivers
seem
a
sensible
course
of
action
the
third
source
said
referring
to
potential
exemptions
from
the
latest
sanctions
but
you
need
to
reduce
your
volume
take
over
the
grace
period
of
days
to
be
favourably
treated
in
the
waiver
discussion
you
can
t
just
stay
at
current
levels
until
then
