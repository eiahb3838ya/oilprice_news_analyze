update 2-trump biofuel policy overhaul to include fewer refinery waivers - source
reuters
the
trump
administration
will
scale
back
the
use
of
biofuels
waivers
for
small
refineries
and
count
ethanol
exports
toward
federal
biofuels
usage
quotas
as
part
of
a
broad
overhaul
of
the
nation
s
renewable
fuel
policy
a
source
briefed
on
the
plans
said
on
friday
the
changes
are
aimed
at
easing
tensions
between
the
oil
and
corn
industries
rivals
that
have
been
clashing
for
months
over
the
future
of
the
renewable
fuel
standard
a
law
that
requires
refiners
to
add
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
into
the
nation
s
gasoline
and
diesel
while
the
rfs
has
helped
farmers
by
creating
a
billion
gallon
a
year
market
for
ethanol
oil
refiners
have
increasingly
complained
that
complying
with
the
law
costs
them
a
fortune
and
threatens
the
very
jobs
president
donald
trump
has
promised
to
protect
after
hosting
several
meetings
between
representatives
of
the
corn
and
refining
industries
the
administration
is
in
the
last
stages
of
formally
proposing
changes
to
the
biofuels
law
intended
to
appease
both
sides
the
source
said
on
friday
a
white
house
announcement
is
imminent
the
source
said
but
did
not
have
a
timetable
the
changes
would
be
subject
to
the
federal
process
added
the
source
who
was
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
the
white
house
did
not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for
comment
the
biofuels
changes
include
cutting
back
on
the
number
of
waivers
that
the
environmental
protection
agency
can
provide
to
small
refiners
to
free
them
from
the
regulation
and
to
ensure
that
any
waived
obligations
are
redistributed
to
other
refiners
the
epa
is
required
by
the
rfs
to
provide
such
waivers
to
refineries
of
less
than
barrels
per
day
in
capacity
that
can
prove
that
complying
with
the
rfs
would
cause
them
disproportionate
economic
hardship
but
the
agency
has
broad
discretion
over
assessing
the
applications
in
recent
months
the
epa
has
granted
more
than
two
dozen
such
waivers
in
an
effort
to
help
the
refining
industry
cope
with
the
rfs
about
triple
the
typical
level
under
past
administrations
angering
the
corn
lobby
which
argued
the
exemptions
are
reducing
overall
demand
for
ethanol
reuters
has
reported
that
the
recent
epa
waivers
have
gone
to
refineries
belonging
to
companies
like
the
large
and
andeavor
and
to
cvr
energy
owned
by
billionaire
trump
ally
carl
icahn
the
source
did
not
say
by
how
much
the
waiver
program
would
be
reduced
but
said
that
the
administration
was
committed
to
ensuring
that
any
waivers
provided
do
not
have
the
effect
of
reducing
the
amount
of
biofuels
blended
in
a
given
year
something
that
would
be
accomplished
by
redistributing
waived
blending
obligations
to
other
refineries
republican
senator
tom
barraso
who
represents
wyoming
home
to
several
smaller
refineries
said
he
would
oppose
any
agreement
that
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
small
refineries
to
obtain
hardship
relief
in
the
another
change
will
be
to
allow
exports
of
biofuels
like
ethanol
to
count
toward
the
annual
biofuels
volume
mandates
under
the
rfs
which
could
ease
the
burden
on
domestic
refiners
by
reducing
the
amounts
they
would
have
to
blend
domestically
biofuels
groups
have
strongly
opposed
the
idea
saying
it
could
spark
trade
tensions
and
goes
against
the
rfs
intent
to
increase
domestic
use
of
biofuels
counting
exports
toward
the
annual
volumes
mandates
would
be
achieved
by
allowing
such
shipments
to
qualify
for
tradable
biofuels
credits
that
must
be
turned
in
to
epa
each
year
to
prove
compliance
with
the
rfs
the
trump
administration
s
tweaks
to
the
rfs
would
also
include
temporarily
lifting
restrictions
on
selling
a
certain
kind
of
blend
gasoline
in
the
summer
called
according
to
the
source
trump
has
already
publicly
stated
his
support
for
such
a
move
which
has
been
long
sought
by
the
corn
lobby
because
it
would
theoretically
expand
the
market
for
biofuels
sales
of
are
currently
banned
in
the
summer
over
worries
that
it
could
increase
smog
but
the
biofuels
industry
and
numerous
scientific
studies
show
that
is
little
different
from
the
currently
approved
blends
in
that
regard
the
white
house
and
epa
did
not
immediately
respond
to
request
for

about
the
proposed
changes

the
