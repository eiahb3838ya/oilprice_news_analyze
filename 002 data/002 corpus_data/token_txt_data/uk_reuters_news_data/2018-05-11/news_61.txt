oil
prices
on
friday
held
highs
reached
the
previous
session
as
looming
sanctions
against
major
oil
producer
and
iran
threatened
to
tip
an
already
tight
market
into
undersupply
the
united
states
plans
to
sanctions
against
iran
which
produces
around
percent
of
global
oil
supplies
after
abandoning
an
agreement
reached
in
late
that
limited
tehran
s
nuclear
ambitions
in
exchange
for
removing
sanctions
the
sanctions
come
amid
an
oil
market
that
has
been
tightening
due
to
strong
demand
especially
in
asia
and
as
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
and
top
producer
russia
have
led
efforts
since
to
withhold
oil
supplies
to
prop
up
prices

the

west

intermediate
wti
crude
futures
were

a
barrel
also
not
far
off
thursday
s
november
high
of

many
analysts
expect
oil
prices
to
rise
to
per
barrel
later
this
year
once
sanctions
start
to
bite
and
iran
s
exports
start
sinking
there
are
however
signs
that
other
suppliers
from
within
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
will
step
up
output
in
order
to
counter
the
iran
disruption
the
market
is
now
focused
on
opec
and
other
producers
ability
to
react
to
this
potential

investors
are
increasingly
viewing
kuwait
and
iraq
as
the
producers
with
the
best
ability
to
raise
output
quickly
in
response
to
any
fall
in
iranian
exports
it
added
outside
opec
soaring
crude
oil
production
may
also
help
fill
iran
s
supply
gap
hitting
another
record
last
week
by
climbing
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
that
s
up
percent
since
and
means
output
is
creeping
ever
closer
to
that
