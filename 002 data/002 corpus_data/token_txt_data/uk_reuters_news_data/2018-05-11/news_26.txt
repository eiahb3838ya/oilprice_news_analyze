refile-analysis-some u.s. fund managers finally convinced oil rally is for real
new
york
reuters
fund
managers
are
barrelling
into
the
energy
sector
by
making
broad
bets
on
anything
connected
with
oil
finally
convinced
that
gains
in
crude
prices
on
track
for
their
fourth
consecutive
quarterly
gain
the
longest
such
stretch
for
more
than
years
are
more
than
a
mirage
ever
since
oil
prices
slid
in
late
after
rallying
above
a
barrel
mutual
fund
managers
have
largely
stayed
underweight
the
sector
convinced
that
advances
in
fracking
technology
would
allow
production
to
ramp
up
at
any
moment
and
keep
a
lid
on
prices
yet
with
oil
futures
hitting
highs
on
thursday
up
approximately
percent
from
this
time
last
year
after
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
and
producer
russia
led
efforts
since
to
cap
output
some
fund
managers
are
convinced
that
high
oil
prices
are
finally
here
to
stay
fund
managers
from
westwood
hotchkiss
and
wiley
and
hodges
capital
are
among
those
who
say
they
are
making
broad
bets
on
anything
oil
they
say
that
oil
prices
will
not
dip
back
down
quickly
because
global
demand
is
rising
at
a
time
when
energy
companies
are
showing
less
inclination
to
take
on
debt
to
fuel
production
and
have
tightened
operations
oil
companies
are
so
much
more
efficient
then
they
were
even
a
year
ago
and
much
more
disciplined
i
think
that
you
can
finally
say
that
this
is
the
real
deal
said
gary
bradshaw
a
portfolio
manager
at
hodges
capital
at
the
same
time
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
on
tuesday
raises
geopolitical
risks
giving
oil
another
leg
higher
fund
managers
said
crude
hit
per
barrel
on
thursday
its
highest
since
november
a
reuters
poll
at
the
end
of
april
forecast
that
oil
would
average
in
bradshaw
expects
crude
oil
prices
to
stay
at
roughly
between
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
boosting
the
earnings
of
companies
such
as
schlumberger
nv
and
diamondback
energy
inc
still
bradshaw
does
not
see
them
spiking
high
enough
to
significantly
cut
into
consumer
spending
or
the
broader
economy
although
they
may
crimp
the
spending
power
for
the
most
customers
he
said
which
could
eat
into
the
revenues
of
value
chains
like

general
corp
the
dramatic
comeback
in
oil
prices
which
have
jumped
nearly
percent
for
the
year
to
date
has
helped
the
s
p
energy
sector
jump
percent
over
the
same
time
the
broad
s
p
as
a
whole
by
comparison
is
up
less
than
percent
since
the
start
of
the
year
that
in
turn
is
prodding
fund
managers
back
into
the
sector
they
had
largely
shunned
nine
months
ago
global
funds
were
underweight
energy
stocks
by
percent
on
average
the
largest
collective
underweight
since
according
to
a
september
report
by
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
in
april
by
comparison
equity
allocations
to
commodities
and
energy
stocks
hit
highs

merrill
lynch
noted
we
ve
already
had
some
of
the
trade
but
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
said
bill
costello
a
senior
portfolio
manager
at
westwood
who
has
been
adding
to
his
positions
in
energy
companies
such
as
callon
petroleum
co
and
src
energy
inc
while
energy
stocks
have
rallied
shares
are
still
trading
at
levels
that
suggest
that
oil
will
remain
between
and
a
barrel
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
costello
said
if
people
believed
in
a
barrel
plus
for
the
next
months
they
would
be
foolish
to
be
underweight
now
costello
said
adding
that
he
expects
more
money
to
flow
into
the
sector
as
fund
managers
sell
utilities
and
telecom
stocks
that
are
getting
hurt
by
rising
interest
rates
the
stretched
valuations
of
the
s
p
which
is
about
percent
below
the
record
high
it
hit
in
january
should
provide
another
support
for
energy
stocks
said
stan
majcher
of
the
hotchkis
wiley
mid
cap
value
fund
we
look
at
it
and
say
the
overall
market
is
close
to
expensive
and
this
is
one
area
which
is
and
viewed
in
the
last
few
years
as
a
risky
place
he
said
signs
of
declining
production
by
opec
countries
such
as
venezuela
and
bottlenecks
that
could
slow
production
in
the
permian
basin
in
the
could
push
oil
prices
well
above
by
the
end
of
the
year
leaving
fund
managers
flatfooted
majcher
said
we
think
that
the
biggest
risk
is
not
preparing
for
higher
oil
prices
