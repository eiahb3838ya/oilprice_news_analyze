and
tens
of
thousands
of
nepalis
work
in
india
the
neigbours
share
close
religious
and
cultural
bonds
but
india
has
been
slow
to
implement
projects
despite
ambitious
plans
and
it
has
also
often
been
a
target
of
nepali
politicians
critical
of
what
they
see
as
meddling
by
their
overweening
much
bigger
neighbour
china
on
the

pouring
aid
and
investment
into

remains
a
steadfast
partner

indian
rupees
million
with
the

to
the
closure
of

the

there
was
lingering
anger
towards
india
over
the

under
pressure
to
bring
the
nepal
ties
back
to
normal
and
win
the
confidence
of
the
nepali
people
