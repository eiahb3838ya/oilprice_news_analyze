reuters
residents
on
the
big
island
of
hawaii
were
alerted
on
thursday
to
rising
levels
of
toxic
gas
from
fissures
and
geologists
warned
that
new
areas
east
of
the
erupting
kilauea
volcano
may
be
at
risk
of
molten
rock
bursting
from
the
ground
hawaii
county
authorities
sent
a
text
message
to
residents
of
the
southeast
corner
of
the
island
warning
them
of
a
wind
change
that
would
bring
rising
levels
of
sulfur
dioxide
gas
which
can
be
fatal
if
inhaled
in
large
quantities
it
s
just
horrible
you
can
t
breathe
in
there
said
evacuated
resident
robynn
stagg
who
drove
through
the
thick
orange
sulfur
dioxide
haze
earlier
this
week
in
a
failed
attempt
to
check
on
her
home
hawaii
s
governor
has
warned
that
mass
evacuations
may
be
required
as
more
fissures
open
in
the
ground
and
spew
lava
and
gas
into
residential
areas
on
the
east
flank
of
kilauea
one
of
the
world
s
most
active
volcanoes
during
an
evening
meeting
with
community
members
an
official
with
the
united
states
geological
survey
s
hawaii
volcano
observatory
said
that
while
no
new
fissures
have
opened
during
the
last
hours
there
has
been
quite
a
bit
of
ground
cracking
over
the
last
day
and
that
they
were
releasing
steam
because
the
lava
intrusion
is
still
active
and
earthquakes
are
still
occurring
we
still
think
there
s
a
decent
chance
of
new
eruptive
activity
at
the
surface
steven
brantley
said
authorities
on
thursday
completed
the
removal
of
highly
flammable
chemicals
from
a
nearby
geothermal
power
plant
that
was
in
the
path
of
creeping
lava
the
latest
upheaval
at
kilauea
began
last
week
after
the
crater
floor
of
a
side
vent
collapsed
suddenly
in
a
cloud
of
ash
triggering
a
similar
plunge
in
the
molten
lake
inside
the
larger
crater
at
the
volcano
s
summit
what
followed
was
a
flurry
of
earthquakes
as
huge
volumes
of
magma
the
term
for
lava
beneath
the
surface
drained
back
through
passages
that
carried
the
molten
rock
far
downslope
the
lava
then
forced
its
way
back
to
the
surface
through
large
cracks
or
fissures
that
opened
at
ground
level
in
a
residential
area
miles
km
away
graphic

earth
geologists
said
kilauea
may
be
entering
a
new
phase
of
explosive
eruptions
not
seen
in
nearly
a
century
that
could
hurl
ballistic
blocks
weighing
up
to
tons
for
half
a
mile
meters
and
rain
fragments
for
another
mile
or
two
to
km
however
the
immediate
vicinity
around
the
summit
an
area
controlled
by
the
national
park
service
was
to
be
closed
to
visitors
indefinitely
starting
on
thursday
night
such
blasts
would
likely
also
eject
plumes
of
volcanic
ash
that
could
be
carried
farther
downwind
into
neighboring
communities
creating
a
nuisance
and
potential
respiratory
irritant
but
not
a
hazard
officials
said
the
leilani
estates
community
remains
in
greatest
danger
with
volcanic
fissures
so
far
having
destroyed
structures
most
of
them
homes
and
forcing
the
evacuation
of
about
residents
but
as
the
eruption
progresses
other
areas
of
the
lower
east
rift
zone
may
also
be
at
risk
the
hawaiian
volcano
observatory
said
in
a
bulletin
there
is
the
potential
for
additional
outbreaks
christina
neal
the
chief
scientist
at
the
geological
survey
s
hawaiian
volcano
observatory
at
kilauea
told
a
news
briefing
there
are
other
communities
other
residential
neighborhoods
that
could
depending
on
the
evolution
of
activity
be
in
harm
s
hawaii
governor
david
ige
has
requested
federal
disaster
assistance
as
he
said
a
mass
evacuation
of
the
lower
puna
district
where
leilani
estates
is
located
would
be
beyond
current
county
and
state
capabilities
hawaii
police
said
they
arrested
alexandru

suspicion
he
burgled
four
houses
in
leilani
estates
after
the
mayor
declared
an
emergency
the
area
on
last
week
local
meteorologists
said
the
change
in
prevailing
winds
could
send

some

after
the

was
hit
by
a

earthquake
on

the
biggest
since
the

added
