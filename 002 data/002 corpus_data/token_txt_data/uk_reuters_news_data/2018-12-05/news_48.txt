the
polish
official
leading
talks
to
revive
the
paris
climate
deal
said
his
country
is
committed
to
greener
fuel
even
though
his
president
has
vowed
not
to
let
anyone
murder
coal
mining
on
tuesday
the
first
full
day
of
negotiations
in
katowice
capital
of
mining
region
silesia
president
andrzej
duda
told
workers
celebrating
the
feast
of
their
patron
saint
barbara
that
the
industry
had
a
long
future
the
comments
sent
through
talks
poland
is
hosting
to
agree
rules
for
implementing
the
paris
accord
to
phase
out
fossil
fuel
poland
s
deputy
environment
minister
michal
kurtyka
told
reuters
he
is
working
towards
an
ambitious
deal
that
respects
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
paris
and
said
it
was
the
energy
ministry
not
the
president
who
set
policy
poland
is
not
building
any
more
new
coal
structures
it
s
a
very
powerful
engagement
he
said
in
the
interview
new
additional
capacities
are
being
built
in
the
renewables
poland
which
relies
on
coal
for
around
percent
of
its
power
and
more
than
mining
jobs
is
an
unlikely
host
for
climate
talks
but
kurtyka
said
the
country
was
eager
to
share
with
the
rest
of
the
world
its
capacity
for
transition
over
the
last
years
the
former
nation
has
shifted
from
a
economy
which
the
official
said
was
not
a
good
system
for
humans
or
the
environment
now
as
the
presidency
of
climate
talks
he
said
poland
was
seeking
a
just
transition
to
a
greener
world
those
comments
may
allay
concern
over
duda
s
speech
on
tuesday
where
he
declared
to
miners
please
don
t
be
worried
as
long
as
i
m
president
of
poland
i
won
t
let
anyone
murder
together
with
britain
poland
on
tuesday
launched
an
initiative
to
promote
electric
vehicles
which
kurtyka
said
would
be
less
polluting
than
conventional
engines
even
if
they
were
powered
by
electricity
trained
as
an
engineer
kurtyka
said
electric
vehicles
were
more
efficient
than
internal
combustion
engines
which
generate
waste
heat
and
pollution
nearly
countries
had
signed
up
to
the
initiative
on
knowledge
sharing
he
said
and
for
poland
electric
mobility
could
help
the
country
generate
jobs
to
replace
mining
campaigners
are
highly
critical
of
the
pace
of
change
as
evidence
mounts
of
the
growing
gap
between
the
need
to
cut
emissions
and
the
work
done
so
far
this
week
s
talks
are
technical
negotiations
ahead
of
ministerial
debate
next
week
kurtyka
said
challenges
included
sharing
the
burden
between
developed
and
developing
nations
of
the
cost
of
moving
to
a
world
but
political
will
was
strong
to
deliver
on
the
paris
agreement
and
climate
concern
could
override
national
agendas
even
in
politically
divided
times
he
added
i
think
it
is
considered
very
much
as
a
unique
achievement
of
humanity
he
said
of
the
paris
agreement
it
is
in
their
hands
it
is
in
the
parties
hands
to
reach
a
consensus
he
said
referring
to
the
nearly
nations
involved
adding
i
am
very
reassured
everybody
s
willing
