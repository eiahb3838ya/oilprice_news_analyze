green
strategies
like
bike
lanes
and
better
building
codes
could
bring
world
cities
a
collective
billion
worth
of
benefits
while
fighting
climate
change
according
to
research
by
a
global
network
of
cities
cities
pinpointed
transport
buildings
and
industry
as
priorities
to
be
incorporated
into
climate
change
policies
doing
so
would
encourage
large
investments
and
avert
premature
deaths
as
people
live
and
work
longer
this
research
quantifies
and
provides
the
business
case
for
what
mayors
have
long
known
to
be
true
taking
bold
climate
action
also
improves
public
health
executive
director
mark
watts
said
in
a
statement
there
is
no
longer
any
for
cities
between
delivering
policies
that
benefit
the
environment
drive
economic
growth
and
improve
the
health
of
cities
are
key
in
the
fight
against
climate
change
according

ifc
more
than
half
the
global
population
lives
in
cities
which
consume
over
of
the
world
s
energy
and
account
for
more
than
percent
of
all
carbon
dioxide
emissions
the
ifc
says
researchers
said
cities
should
implement
walking
cycling
and
mass
transit
policies
introduce
stringent
emission
standards
promote
vehicles
and
establish
zero
emission
areas
cities
should
also
adopt
strict
regulations
for
new
buildings
and
retrofit
older
buildings
to
improving
heating
ventilation
air
conditioning
water
heating
and
lighting
systems
researchers
added
industry
and
businesses
should
use
energy
efficient
technologies
emissions
capturing
and
maintenance
and
monitoring
are
all
important
if
climate
goals
are
to
be
achieved
they
said
by
focusing
on
green
approaches
to
transport
buildings
and
industry
cities
could
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
percent
and
hazardous
airborne
pollutants
known
as
by
percent
according
to
the
researchers
where
the
problem
lies
in
terms
of
emissions
is
also
where
the
solution
lies
said

director

it
is
not
mutually
exclusive
when
you
talk
about
development
and
building
healthy
cities

although
many
cities
have
already
identified
or
implemented
some
of
the
measures
suggested
in
the
report
the
three
key
areas
in
the
research
needed
to
be
fully
