as
saying
opec

trump
wrote
on

on

none
of
today
s
comments
should
have
come
as
a
surprise
since
the
key
unknown
remains
the
size

any
such
reduction
and
how
the
cuts
are
distributed
jim
ritterbusch
president
of
ritterbusch
and
associates
said
in
a
note
the
trump
administration
appears
to
be
maintaining
pressure
on
the
saudis
to
limit
any
production
cuts
in
precluding
significant
price
advances
from
current
levels
and
the
fact
that
russia
still
appears
somewhat
would
appear
to
tilt
odds
in
favor
of
about
a
million
barrels
per
day
