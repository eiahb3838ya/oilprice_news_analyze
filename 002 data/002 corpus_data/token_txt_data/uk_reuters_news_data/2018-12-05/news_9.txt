china
will
ramp
up
imports
of
argentine
soyoil
after
argentina
begins
harvesting
its
next
soy
crop
in
march
a
government
official
told
reuters
but
talks
toward
reaching
a
deal
to
sell
soymeal
livestock
feed
to
china
have
fizzled
the
soyoil
agreement
is
good
news
for
argentine
crushing
plants
that
manufacture
soyoil
and
have
been
hard
hit
by
the
trade
war
the
chinese
agreed
to
buy
to
tonnes
of
soyoil
from
argentina
santiago
del
solar
chief
of
staff
to
argentina
s
agriculture
secretary
said
late
on
tuesday
he
said
the
deal
was
signed
during
president
xi
jinping
s
state
visit
at
the
weekend
that
compares
to
tonnes
of
soyoil
sent
to
china
over
the
last
three
years
del
solar
said
and
would
be
worth
million
to
million
per
year
based
on
current
prices
but
negotiations
aimed
at
allowing
soymeal
livestock
feed
to
be
exported
to
china
have
gone
cold
while
china
and
the
united
states
enter
talks
aimed
at
ending
the
trade
war
he
said
they
are
not
interested
in
buying
soymeal
from
us
right
now
but
we
will
keep
talking
del
solar
said
he
did
not
say
why
china
had
backed
away
the
chinese
embassy
in
buenos
aires
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
china
so
far
has
chosen
to
support
its
own
crushing
industry
by
importing
raw
beans
to
be
processed
in
chinese
plants
but
trade
tensions
have
all
but
halted
beans
going
to
china
if
china
does
not
soybean
imports
from
the
united
states
it
is
possible
they
will
come
back
to
argentina
to
talk
about
importing
soymeal
said
gustavo
lopez
head
of
the
local
agritrend
consultancy
argentina
is
the
world
s
biggest
supplier
of
both
soymeal
and
soyoil
which
is
used
in
cooking
and
making
biofuels
washington
and
beijing
s
trade
dispute
has
made
argentine
crushing
plants
uncompetitive
against
their
counterparts
which
are
benefiting
from
a
soy
glut
created
by
the
percent
tariff
that
china
has
placed
on
beans
argentine
crushing
plants
have
been
reduced
to
working
at
only
percent
capacity
until
argentina
was
the
biggest
supplier
of
soyoil
to
china
with
volumes
of
or
million
tonnes
per
year
china
then
introduced
a
new
policy
to
increase
its
own
crushing
facilities
so
it
put
up
some
technical
barriers
against
importing
argentine
soyoil
said
gustavo
idigoras
president
of
the
chamber
of
grains
exporter
and
soy
crushing
companies
toward
the
end
of
china
halted
all
argentine
soyoil
imports
for
two
years
the
trade
started
picking
up
slowly
this
year
