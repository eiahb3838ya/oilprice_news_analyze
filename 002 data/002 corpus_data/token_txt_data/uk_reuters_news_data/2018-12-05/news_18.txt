on
wednesday
forecast
a
roughly
percent
drop
in
capital
spending
in
compared
with
blaming
a
lack
of
market
access
for
its
oil
and
the
dysfunctional
pipeline
nomination
process
but
canada
s
largest
oil
producer
also
said
relief
was
on
the
horizon
noting
it
sees
some
barrels
per
day
bpd
worth
of
new
takeaway
capacity
in
place
for
western
canadian
producers
by
the
fourth
quarter
of
that
will
be
further
bolstered
by
the
alberta
government
s
controversial
decision
to
mandate
output
cuts
of
percent
or
bpd
to
help
boost
sagging
canadian
crude
prices
a
plan
which
canadian
natural
supports
the
company
s
shares
jumped
percent
trading
at
c
on
the
toronto
stock
exchange
as
the
broader
energy
sector
rallied
on
higher
oil
prices
canadian
natural
set
its
capital
budget
at
around
c
billion
billion
down
about
c
billion
from
spending
with
maintenance
capital
targeted
at
about
c
billion
if
prices
normalize
further
out
combined
with
more
certain
market
access
we
will
look
to
add
growth
capital
in
to
the
c
billion
range
which
would
give
us
growth
in
and
beyond
said
canadian
natural
president
tim
mckay
in
a
webcast
presentation
to
investors
canadian
natural
said
the
alberta
government
s
curtailment
plan
has
already
improved
the
outlook
for
prices
in
early
though
it
continues
to
monitor
the
impact
the
rare
move
to
mandate
cuts
is
unusual
for
a
market
economy
like
canada
and
a
number
of
integrated
producers
with
secured
pipeline
access
and
domestic
refinery
capacity
expressed
disappointment
saying
they
prefer
market
solutions
to
the
canadian
natural
also
said
it
was
pushing
for
immediate
changes
to
the
nomination
system
for
canada
s
largest
crude
pipeline
network
enbridge
inc
s
mainline
system
that
carries
about
million
bpd
of
crude
and
other
liquids
operates
as
a
common
carrier
which
means
producers
nominate
or
request
space
on
the
line
on
a
monthly
basis
and
are
allocated
a
share
of
capacity
based
on
total
requests
producers
game
the
system
by
requesting
more
space
than
they
need
leading
to
air
barrels
leaving
the
pipelines
running
below
capacity
this
market
inconsistency
is
the
reason
why
canadian
natural
and
other
producers
feel
the
nomination
process
is
broken
and
the
market
is
dysfunctional
said
bryan
bradley
canadian
natural
s
vice
president
of
marketing
enbridge
has
been
trying
to
fix
the
problem
for
years
looking
ahead
canadian
natural
said
it
expects
volumes
to
rise
by
bpd
through
topping
some
bpd
by
compared
with
september
s
rail
exports
of
nearly
bpd
longer
term
the
company
is
watching
progress
of
two
export
projects
that
have
faced
recent
delays
transcanada
corp
s
keystone
xl
pipeline
and
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
expansion
together
they
would
add
another
million
bpd
of
export
capacity
for
canadian
producers
of
which
canadian
natural
has
secured
bpd
of
space
that
transport
security
would
allow
the
company
to
move
ahead
with
larger
growth
projects
canadian
natural
said
it
expects
production
to
be
between
million
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
boepd
and
million
boepd
the
company
said
it
has
the
ability
to
produce
more
condensate
a
very
light
oil
that
is
used
in
blending
and
is
not
included
