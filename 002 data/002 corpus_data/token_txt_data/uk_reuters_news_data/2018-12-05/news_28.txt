the
recent
nosedive
in
crude
prices
came
just
as
shale
producers
had
started
delivering
healthy
returns
after
years
of
heavy
spending
to
boost
production
and
market
share
the
shift
has
pleased
investors
who
had
grown
weary
of
waiting
for
a
payoff
while
watching
the
frenetic
west
texas
shale
boom
make
the
united
states
the
world
s
top
oil
producer
and
a
major
exporter
the
percent
drop
in
oil
prices
since
october
now
threatens
those
improved
margins
and
sustained
prices
below
could
dent
the
value
of
shale
reserves
which
banks
use
to
determine
borrowing
power
activity
in
the
largest
oil
field
could
fall
to
percent
next
year
if
prices
stay
down
said
steven
pruett
chief
executive
of
shale
producer
elevation
resources
llc
the
price
retreat
sparked
a
of
shale
firms
shares
and
another
setback
could
sour
investors
on
the
sector
for
years
the
dynamic
leaves
shale
producers
hoping
for
a
rescue
in
the
form
of
production
cuts
from
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
when
it
meets
on
thursday
and
at
odds
with
president
donald
trump
who
has
pushed
opec
to
keep
the
taps
wide
open
although
trump
has
generally
been
a
boisterous
booster
of
firms
he
has
ridiculed
the
prospect
of
opec
production
cuts
as
ripping
off
the
rest
of
the
world
by
artifically
inflating
consumer
fuel
prices
in
november
trump
praised
saudi
arabia
on
twitter
for
high
production
that
helped
push
oil
prices
down
about
percent
to
near
calling
it
like
a
big
tax
such
tweets
are
an
irritant
to
a
oil
industry
trying
to
solidify
its
profitable
position
trump
s
leaning
on
saudi
arabia
the
most
influential
opec
nation
has
had
a
great
effect
pruett
said
to
me
it
s
a
lot
of
meddling
he
said
trump
s
campaign
against
opec
cuts
comes
after
he
stood
by
the
kingdom
and
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
despite
politicians
calling
for
sanctions
over
the
october
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
riyadh
s
consulate
in
istanbul
prince
salman
wants
to
avoid
confrontation
with
trump
saudi
watchers
say
including
over
oil
production
cuts
and
prices
while
shale
producers
have
made
strides
in
recent
years
at
turning
profits
with
lower
oil
prices
they
are
nearing
a
threshold
where
some
would
scale
back
investment
said
phil
flynn
an
analyst
at
price
futures
group
in
chicago
the
reality
is
a
lot
of
them
get
scared
at
and
their
bankers
get
scared
at
said
flynn
they
want
opec
to
make
a
cut
and
they
kind
of
want
donald
trump
to
stop
tweeting
about
oil
production
will
rise
percent
this
year
to
average
daily
output
of
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
and
hit
million
bpd
by
mid
according
to
government
estimates
after
years
of
increasing
capital
spending
companies
including
anadarko
petroleum
corp
plan
to
freeze
or
cut
those
budgets
passing
the
savings
to
investors
even
if
opec
pulls
back
and
global
prices
stabilize
at
current
levels
it
may
not
be
enough
for
shale
to
regain
investor
favor
said
bruce
campbell
president
of
advisers
campbell
lee
ross
investment
management
inc
the
firm
owns
royal
dutch
shell
shares
because
of
its
strong
dividend
and
balance
sheet
but
no
longer
sees
a
reason
to
invest
in
shale
shale
companies
can
cut
costs
further
but
it
takes
to
months
to
roll
through
the
system
and
get
profits
rising
again
he
said
without
higher
crude
prices
it
will
be
tough
for
investors
to
find
a
place
to
get
excited
about
campbell
said
since
the
price
war
between
opec
and
shale
producers
when
soaring
global
supply
pushed
prices
down
into
the
west
texas
shale
drillers
have
learned
to
wring
profits
at
prices
as
low
as
a
barrel
down
from
about
in
according
to
consultancy
rystad
energy
but
breakeven
prices
in
other
fields
range
from
about
to
per
barrel
not
far
from
november
s
low
meanwhile
middle
east
producers
costs
are
about
a
barrel
in
iraq
less
than
in
saudi
arabia
and
less
than
in
kuwait
according
to
rystad
these
countries
however
need
much
higher
prices
to
finance
their
state
spending
in
saudi
arabia
crude
would
have
to
average
a
barrel
to
cover
this
year

state
budget
an
international
monetary
fund
official
said
the
industry
is
still
expanding
the
use
of
more
efficient
drilling
techniques
and
oil
majors
bp
plc
chevron
corp
and
exxon
mobil
corp
are
expanding
shale
operations
and
building

to
keep

shale
is
a
scale

said
shawn
reynolds
a
portfolio
manager
at
investment
firm
vaneck
he
sees
an
industry
just
now
poised
to
move
out
of
its
costly
development
phase
and
into
what
reynolds
calls
harvest
mode
pulling
profit
from
past
investments
but
a
continued
price
decline
would
threaten
recent
robust
earnings
last

conocophillips
profit
rose
over
a
year
earlier
aided
by
cost
cuts
that
significantly
improved
our
resilience
to
low
prices
chief

ryan
lance
said
during
an
earnings
call
last
month
anadarko
swung
to
a
profit
and
said
it
expects
to
increase
production
percent
to
percent
next
year
assuming
oil
said
ceo
al
walker
other
producers
are
counting
on
a
replay
of
when
opec
cut
output
and
prices
gradually
increased
i
ve
been
through
it
before
bob
watson
ceo
of
texas
shale
producer
abraxas
petroleum
corp
said
in
an
interview
he
has
told
his
employees
not
to
worry
about
the
price
it
will
come
back
you
just
need
to
keep
watson
like
other
large
shale
companies
used
financial
derivatives
to
lock
in
some
of
its
future
production
at
a
barrel
a
move
that
lets
it
ride
out
the
recent
drop
barring
a
sustained
change
oil
output
will
rise
by
million
bpd
this
year
while
oil
demand
should
grow
by
a
million
bpd
next
year
projects
the
international
energy
agency
which
advises
major
oil
consumers
on
energy
policy
that
could
lead
again
to
a
market
awash
in
oil
lowering
global
prices
opec
this
week
must
decide
whether
the
global
economy
will
need
more
oil
or
less
after
months
of
producing
well
below
the
group
s
target
group
leaders
increased
production
last
summer
and
by
october
had
added
nearly
barrels
per
day
over
september
russia
also
increased
its
production
by
about
bpd
above
its
cap
opec
realizes
that
in
the
last
downturn
in
an
effort
to
grab
market
share
they
got
nowhere
they
ended
up
losing
market
share
to
some
extent
said
muqsit
ashraf

strategy
one
lesson
from
the
last
price
war
is
shale
can
expand
production
even
at
prices
that
hurt
opec
members
budgets
said
karr
ingham

texas
oil
and

companies
in
the

pumped
million

when

rose
to
nearly
million
bpd
two
years
later
as
prices
fell

according
to
data
from

administration
opec
can
wait
from
now
until

they
won
