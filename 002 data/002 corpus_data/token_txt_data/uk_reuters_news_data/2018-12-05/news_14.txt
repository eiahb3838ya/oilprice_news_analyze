global carbon emissions set to rise further this year -study

global
carbon
dioxide
emissions
are
set
to
rise
nearly
percent
this
year
due
to
continued
fossil
fuel
use
scientists
said
on
wednesday
dashing
hopes
that
an
increase
in
was
temporary
after
two
years
of
slowdown
world
emissions
grew
by
percent
last
year
and
will
increase
even
more
this
year
due
to
the
sustained
use
of
coal
oil
and
natural
gas
an
annual
report
by
the
global
carbon
project
showed
a
group
of
scientists
in
countries
carbon
dioxide
emissions
were
roughly
flat
from
which
led
to
hopes
that
emissions
had
peaked
in
the
data
presented
during
talks
among
around
nations
in
poland
on
implementing
the
paris
agreement
climate
accord
are
a
setback
for
a
global
goal
of
curbing
emissions
to
avert
more
floods
heat
waves
and
rising
sea
levels
the
world
is
on
track
for
a
degrees
celsius
rise
in
global
average
temperature
this
century
and
if
all
known
fossil
fuel
resources
are
used
the
rise
will
be
even
bigger
the
world
meteorological
organization
warned
last
week
the
projected
growth
in
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
fossil
fuels
and
industry
is
percent
in
but
uncertainties
persist
and
growth
rates
between
percent
remain
possible
the
global
carbon
project
report
said
emissions
from
fossil
fuels
cement
and
industry
which
make
up
the
bulk
of
manmade
greenhouse
gases
are
on
track
to
rise
to
a
record
high
of
around
billion
tonnes
this
year
emissions
from
all
human
activities
including
fossil
fuels
industry
and
change
will
reach
around
billion
tonnes
the
report
said
despite
growth
in
technologies
not
enough
is
being
done
to
support
policies
which
limit
emissions
said
glen
peters
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
study
at
the
cicero
center
for
international
climate
research
in
oslo
the
rise
in
emissions
in
could
be
seen
as
a
but
the
growth
rate
in
is
even
higher
and
it
is
becoming
crystal
clear
the
world
is
so
far
failing
in
its
duty
to
steer
onto
a
course
consistent
with
the
goals
set
out
in
the
paris
agreement
in
he
added
nearly
all
countries
have
contributed
to
the
rise
in
global
emissions
either
by
growth
in
emissions
or
reductions
that
are
slower
than
expected
china
s
emissions
are
set
to
rise
around
percent
this
year
as
it
is
still
expected
to
be
reliant
on
coal
over
the
next
decade
even
though
it
has
been
deploying
renewable
energy
the
report
said
due
to
strong
economic
growth
and
continued
use
of
coal
india
s
emissions
are
expected
to
grow
by
percent
this
year
emissions
are
seen
rising
around
percent
this
year
after
falling
percent
a
year
since
however
it
is
expected
that
emissions
will
decline
again
in
as
cheap
gas
wind
and
solar
will
continue
to
displace
coal
the
european
union
should
experience
a
slight
decline
in
emissions
of
percent
this
year
in
the
rest
of
the
world
accounting
for
percent
of
global
emissions
a
rise
of
percent
is
expected
this
group
is
mainly
developing
countries
and
the
five
contributing
the
most
to
emissions
growth
in
the
last
decade
are
saudi
arabia
iran
turkey
iraq
and
south
korea
