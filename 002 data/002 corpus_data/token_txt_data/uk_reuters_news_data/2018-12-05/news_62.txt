denmark
and
britain
are
the
top
countries
when
it

fight
climate
change
although

subsidies
a

global

below
degrees
celsius
this
century
denmark
britain

have
made

sectors
toward
meeting
the
targets
said
the
report
by
researchers
from
britain
s
imperial
college
commissioned
by
british
power
generator
drax
we
researched
how
the
world
is
progressing
on
uptake
of
the
five
key
technologies
and
measures
needed
to
limit
climate
change
to
degrees
celsius
this
reveals
denmark
uk
and
canada
to
be
world
leading
said
imperial
s
iain

the
five
technologies
are
clean
power
fossil
fuels
electric
vehicles
capacity
for
carbon
storage
and
energy
efficiency
of
households
buildings
and

denmark
has
decarbonised
its
electricity
sector
moving
away
from
coal
installing
renewables
and
reducing
fossil
fuel
subsidies
by
percent
over
the
last
decade
britain
has
invested
heavily
in
offshore
wind
and
plans
to
phase
out
power
generation
by
canada
has
also
installed
renewables
and
is
building
facilities
to
capture
and
store
carbon
dioxide
emissions
the
report
assessed
the
climate
change
measures
of
major
countries
including
all
of
the
and
brics
brazil
russia
india
china
and
south
africa
which
together
represent
percent
of
the
world
s
population
and
percent
of
its
carbon
emissions
britain
however
remained
the
sixth
largest
subsidiser
of
fossil
fuels
among
the
countries
the
report
showed
based
on
data
from
the
organisation
for
economic

oecd
up
until
according
to
the
oecd
definition
of
a
fossil
fuel
subsidy
which
includes
direct
expenditures
by
governments
foregone
tax
revenues
and
other
concessions
britain
s
fossil
fuel
support
amounted
to
around
billion
pounds
billion
a
year
coal
has
provided
of
the
world
s
electricity
for
the
past
years
barely
changing
over
the
last
decade
as
the
falling
share
in
most
developed
countries
is
being
countered
by
growing
electricity
demand
in
asian
countries
