trump mocks macron again over french fuel tax protests
paris
reuters
president
donald
trump
has
taken
another
swipe
on
twitter
at
his
french
counterpart
emmanuel
macron
prompted
by
macron
s
woes
over
violent
protests
against
fuel
taxes
i
am
glad
that
my
friend
emmanuelmacron
and
the
protestors
in
paris
have
agreed
with
the
conclusion
i
reached
two
years
ago
trump
tweeted
late
on
tuesday
the
paris
agreement
is
fatally
flawed
because
it
raises
the
price
of
energy
for
responsible
countries
while
whitewashing
some
of
the
worst
polluters
said
trump
referring
to
a
global
deal
on
the
environment
drafted
in
paris
in
late
earlier
this
week
french
prime
minister
edouard
philippe
decided
to
suspend
planned
increases
to
fuel
taxes
for
at
least
six
months
in
response
to
weeks
of
sometimes
violent
protests
marking
the
first
major
by
macron
s
administration
in
months
in
office
