sao

reuters
brazilian
antitrust
watchdog
cade
will
begin
an
investigation
on
wednesday
that
may
result
in
mandatory
sales
of
refineries
by
oil
company
petroleo
brasileiro
sa
cade
said
in
a
statement
according
to
the
cade
statement
the
watchdog
will
investigate
the
influence
of
petrobras
on
fuel
prices
given
that
it
controls
percent
of
brazil
s
refining
capacity
petrobras
earlier
this
year
proposed
selling
a
percent
stake
in
four
refineries
as
part
of
a
wider
effort
to
reduce
debt
the
company
said
it
would
retain
about
percent
of
its
domestic
refining
capacity
after
the
privatization
but
it
stopped
the
process
in
july
after
a
decision
by
the
supreme
court
that
privatizations
must
be
approved
by
congress
and
after
buyers
were
spooked
by
a
truckers
strike
in
may
that
forced
the
company
to
cut
diesel
prices
cade
revived
the
issue
on
wednesday
and
cited
a
previous
analysis
concluded
by
its
technical
body
adding
that
the
partial
sale
of
the
assets
may
not
be
enough
to
create
independent
competitors
and
that
the
company
should
sell
the
assets
the
analysis
by
the
technical
body
said
that
petrobras
should
include
in
the
refineries
sale
units
that
are
close
to
each
other
to
reduce
distribution
costs
and
increase
competition
petrobras
should
also
sell
assets
in
brazil
s
richest
region
the
southeast
the
technical
body
said
the
refineries
the
oil
company
initially
intended
to
offer
to
investors
were
in
other
regions
in
a
statement
the
oil
company
said
it
will
prove
during
the
investigation
it
does
not
have
anticompetitive
practices
petrobras
does
not
have
a
monopoly
on
refining
since
the
but
more
competition
in
the
sector
depends
on
a
regulatory
framework
that
attracts
