plans
to
import
over
barrels
per

bpd
of
refined
products
to
ease
domestic
fuel
shortages
caused
by
hobbled
refineries
and
need
to
prioritize
exports
according
to
internal
documents
seen
by

the
country
with
the
world
s
largest
crude
reserves
this
year
has
not
been
able
to
make
enough
fuel
to
meet
local
demand
and
fulfill
supply
contracts
with
customers
including
those
under
agreements
with
russia
and
china

from
january
through
november
oil
firm
pdvsa
bought
bpd
of
crude
mostly
to
feed
its
isla
refinery
in
curacao
and
bpd
of
refined
products
including
naphtha
for
diluting
its
extra
heavy

gasoline
diesel
for
power
generation
and
components
to
make

the
bpd
of
total
imports
so
far
this

represent
an
record
and
a
increase
compared
with
the
bpd
bought
last
year
according
to
internal
pdvsa
data
analyzed
by
reuters
the
purchases
which
have
expanded
despite
pdvsa
s
cash
constraints
have
been
negotiated
almost
entirely
through
swaps
with
fuel
providers
and
traders
which
receive
venezuelan
crude
and
residual
fuel
according
to
the
data
a
pdvsa
employee
and
traders
involved
in
the
deals
since
february
we
have
not
paid
a
single
imported

venezuelan
