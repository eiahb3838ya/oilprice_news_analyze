opec
s
de
facto
leader
saudi

has
indicated
a
need
for
steep
output
reductions
from
january
fearing
a
glut
but
russia
has
resisted
a
large
cut
all
of

groups
saudi
arabia
russia
and
several
other
producers
met
on
wednesday
exact
volumes
were
still
being
discussed
he
said
the
cuts
would
take
september
or
october
as
baseline
figures

last
from

two
opec
delegates
said
russian

novak
was
flying
back
to
moscow
on

to
get
a
final
agreement
from

saudi
arabia
has
indicated
it
wants
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
allies
to
curb
output
by
at
least
million
barrels
per
day
or
percent
of
global
production
riyadh
wants
moscow

contribute
at

the
cut
but
russia
insists
the
amount
should
be
only
half
of
that

quoted
an
opec
source
as
saying
opec
and
its
allies
were
discussing
the
idea
of
reducing
output
next
year
by
reverting
to
production
quotas
agreed
in
such
a
move
would
mean
cutting
production
by
more
than
million
bpd
saudi
arabia
russia
and
the
uae
have
raised
output
since
june
after
trump
called
for
higher
production
to
compensate
for
lower
iranian
exports
due
to
new
sanctions

russia
saudi

been

the
position
of
top
crude
producer

the

oil
prices
have
fallen
by
almost
a
third
since
october
to
around
per
barrel
after
saudi
arabia
raised
production
to
make
up
for
the
drop
in
iranian
exports
washington
also
gave
sanctions
waivers
to
some
buyers
of
iranian
crude
further
raising
fears
of
an
oil
glut
next

hopefully
opec
will
be
keeping
oil
flows
as
is
not
restricted
the
world
does
not
want
to
see
or
need
higher
oil
prices
trump
wrote
in
a
tweet
on
wednesday
possibly
complicating
any
opec
decision
is
the
crisis
around
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
in
october
trump
has
backed
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
despite
calls
from
many
politicians
to
impose
stiff
sanctions
on
riyadh
how
can
the
saudis
cut
substantially
if
trump
doesn
t
want
a
big
cut
said
gary
ross
chief
executive
of
black
gold
investors
and
a
veteran
opec
watcher
trump
is
worried
about
the
fed
and
inflation
so
he
wants
low
prices
now
also
if
saudis
are
obnoxious
with
a
deep
output
cut
it
will
spur
the
democrats
in
congress
to
go
more
actively
for
the
nopec
legislation
and
the
withdrawal
of
support
for
the
forces
in
the
war
in
yemen
ross
said
the
nopec
legislation
being
discussed
by
lawmakers
could
make
it
possible
to
sue
saudi
arabia
and
other
opec
members
for
price
fixing
bob
mcnally
president
of
rapidan
energy
group
said
opec
was
stuck
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place
given
pressure
from
trump
on
one
hand
and
the
need
for
higher
revenues
on
the
other
we
think
opec
will
try
to
come
up
with
a
fuzzy
production
cut
it
won
t
be
called
a
cut
but
will
effectively
mean
a
cut
which
will
also
be
difficult
to
quantify
