the
european
commission
published
on
wednesday
proposals
to
boost
the
role
of
the
euro
in
international
payments
and
as
a
reserve
currency
to
challenge
the
dominance
of
the
dollar
the
move
follows
the
united
states
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
which
has
forced
many
european
companies
to
stop
trading
with
iran
to
avoid
sanctions
the
eu
executive
commission
called
on
companies
and
states
to
increase
their
use
of
the
euro
in
energy
contracts
and
said
it
would
study
possible
measures
to
promote
the
european
currency
in
financial
and
commodity
markets
the
decision
to
use
a
currency
is
ultimately
made
by
market
participants
the
commission
acknowledged
stressing
the
most
effective
way
to
widening
the
international
role
of
the
euro
was
to
overhaul
the
currency
union
and
adopt
banking
and
financial
reforms
which
have
been
blocked
for
years
by
conflicting
national
interests
