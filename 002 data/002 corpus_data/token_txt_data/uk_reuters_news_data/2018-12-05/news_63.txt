german
solar
battery
maker
sonnen
has
won
approval
to
join
the
lucrative
market
for
keeping
the
country
s
power
network
in
balance
giving
a
boost
to
its
drive
to
reach
profitability
cornefert
head
of
sonnen
s
eservices
retail
unit
told
reuters
it
had
been
accepted
by
germany
s
biggest
power
grid
firm
tennet
to
join
the
balancing
market
in
which
companies
compete
in
auctions
to
either
deliver
power
or
take
it
into
storage
to
keep
the
system
balanced
sonnen
will
start
bidding
in
primary
balancing
power
auctions
from
next
week
by
pooling
the
power
generation
and
storage
of
its
thousands
of
small
customers
he
said
for
the
first
time
a
big
network
of
home
storage
systems
becomes
a
protagonist
in
the
energy
market
cornefert
said
the
move
will
put
sonnen
in
competition
with
german
power
firms
including
big
players
rwe
and
uniper
sonnen
which
secured
million
euros
million
in
may
from
shell
ventures
and
existing
shareholders
to
expand
at
home
and
abroad
has
sold
around
battery
storage
systems
to
german
households
with
rooftop
solar
panels
while
its
customers
typically
consume
percent
of
the
power
they
produce
themselves
the
batteries
help
them
store
power
for
later
use
release
it
to
the
public
grid
or
share
it
with
other
sonnen
community
members
in
an
online
network
joining
the
balancing
market
provides
another
option
with
the
company
set
to
offer
megawatt
mw
blocks
of
flexible
production
or
storage
up
to
a
maximum
mw
it
said
that
only
equates
to
a
small
power
plant
but
has
potential
to
expand
as
storage
becomes
cheaper
and
generation
becomes
less
centralized
germany
has
million
solar
systems
whose
subsidized
sales
tariffs
are
due
to
be
phased
out
in
the
coming
years
providing
balancing
power
is
becoming
more
important
as
more
variable
renewable
power
capacity
is
built
in
germany
s
drive
to
become
a
economy
drops
or
surges
in
grid
frequencies
are
becoming
faster
and
more
intense
grid
frequencies
must
not
deviate
too
far
from
around
hertz
to
keep
flows
on
power
transmission
lines
intact
control
measures
taken
by
grid
managers
entail
adjustments
within
seconds
currently
earning
operators
potentially
around
euros
per
mw
per
year
cornefert
said
sonnen
might
pay
back
earnings
from
the
balancing
market
to
customers
in
the
form
of
entitlements
to
free
