in
a
bid
to
capitalize
on
beijing
s
belt
and
road
initiative
a
senior
official
said
despite
growing
concern
about
the
strings
tied
to
some
of
the
loans
worldwide
despite
indonesia
s
strategic
location
southeast
asia
s
largest
economy
has
not
been
among
the
biggest
beneficiaries
of
china
s
push
to
create
a
modern
day
silk
road
its
belt
and
road
project
is
a
railway
linking

the
textile

which

a
combined
billion
to
billion
said
ridwan
djamaluddin
its
deputy
minister
of
maritime
affairs
indonesia
has
proposed
potential
projects
across
the
archipelago
while
chinese
officials
and
experts
have
toured
regional
governments
in
search
of
projects
to
fund
he
told
reuters
in
an
interview
we
are
fully
aware
that
we
must
not
let
this
cooperation
end
badly
djamaluddin
said
other
countries
have
been
forced
to
pay
back
loans
and
some
have
let
go
of
their
assets
we
don
t
want
getting
agreement
has
taken
longer
than
expected
because
indonesia
insisted
on
a
structure
for
all
its
deals
refusing
to
take
any
loans
he
added
i
understand
we
re
not
as
quick
as
other
countries
to
tap
into
the
fund
because
the
fund
owner
will
think
longer
on
our
offers
djamaluddin
said
he
expected
agreements
in
the
next
round
of
talks
in
april
after
china
responded
to
indonesia
s
most
recent
proposal
last
month
he
added
the
model
would
help
shield
indonesia
from
any
risk
of
china
wielding
leverage
because
of
the
country
s
financial
dependence
djamaluddin
said
any
chinese
investment
must
also
employ
indonesian
workers
and
have
the
most
advanced
environmentally
friendly
technology
and
allow
for
transfer
of
technology
