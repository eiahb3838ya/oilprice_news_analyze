signals
from
the
federal
reserve
last
week
that
it
may
be
nearing
an
end
to
its
rate
hike
cycle
has
pushed
the
treasury
yield
to
lows
below
percent
concerns
about
slowing
growth
have
accelerated
the
flattening
of
the
yield
curve
a
phenomenon
in
which
debt
yields
fall
faster
than
their
counterparts
the
spread
between
the
and
treasury
yields
was
at
its
flattest
level
in
over
a
decade
a
flatter
curve
is
seen
as
an
indicator
of
a
recession
with
lower
yields
suggesting
that
the
markets
see
economic
weakness
ahead
the
economy
is
likely
to
be
able
to
withstand
another
rate
hike
or
two
therefore
the
flattening
of
the
treasury
curve
looks
a
little
over
done
that
said
it
is
true
that
the
economic
outlook
is
murkier
than
before
said
masahiro

at

mitsui
asset
management
there
is
also
brexit
to
keep
an
eye
on
and
this
is
a
factor
in
the
ongoing
risk
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
suffered
embarrassing
defeats
on
tuesday
at
the
start
of
five
days
of
debate
over
her
plans
to
leave
the
european
union
that
could
determine
the
future
of
brexit
and
the
fate
of
her
government
risk
markets
were
also
weighed
down
as
optimism
faded
over
a
truce
made
over
the
weekend
between
president
donald
trump
and
chinese
president
xi
jinping
the
dollar
sagged
in
the
wake
of
falling
treasury
yields
with
its
index

a
basket
