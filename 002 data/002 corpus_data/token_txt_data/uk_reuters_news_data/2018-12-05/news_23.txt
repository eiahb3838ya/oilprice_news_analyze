climate
change
is
one
of
the
best
ways
to
improve
health
around
the
world
and
the
benefits
of
fewer
deaths
and
hospitalisations
would
far
outweigh
the
costs
of
not
acting
the
world
health
organization
said
on
wednesday
keeping
global
warming
well
below
degrees
celsius
as
governments
have
pledged
to
do
under
the
paris
agreement
could
save
about
a
million
lives
a
year
by
through
reducing
air
pollution
alone
the
agency
said
burning
fossil
fuels
which
emit
carbon
dioxide
the
main
culprit
for
climate
change
is
a
major
driver
of
air
pollution
the
who
said
in
a
report
issued
at
climate
talks
in
poland
maria
neira
who
s
director
for
public
health
said
exposure
to
air
pollution
causes
million
deaths
worldwide
every
year
this
is
one
of
the
most
outrageous
things
happening
today
she
said
we
want
to
tell
countries
the
more
you
delay
this
clean
energy
transition
the
more
you
will
be
responsible
for
the
millions
of
deaths
that
are
recorded
every
health
gains
resulting
from
action
to
curb
climate
change
from
adopting
renewable
energy
to
getting
people
out
of
cars
and
onto
bicycles
would
add
up
to
about
twice
the
cost
of
rolling
out
those
policies
globally
and
even
more
in
china
and
india
the
who
said
citing
a
recent
study
who
scientist
and
report
author
diarmid
said
health
had
often
been
disconnected
from
discussions
on
climate
change
but
there
was
now
an
urgent
need
to
break
down
the
barriers
and
talk
about
the
benefits
for
society
this
is
the
same
fight
and
we
have
the
same
answers
he
added
in
the
countries
that
emit
the
most
greenhouse
gases
the
cost
of
air
pollution
for
public
health
is
estimated
at
more
than
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
the
who
report
said
in
comparison
keeping
warming
to
the
paris
deal
temperature
limits
would
require
investing
about
percent
of
global
gdp
kristie
ebi
professor
of
global
health
at
the
university
of
washington
said
the
world
now
had
scientific
evidence
that
people
today
are
suffering
and
dying
from
climate
change
the
consequences
range
from
chronic
diseases
linked
to
air
pollution
such
as
asthma
and
lung
cancer
to
as
crop
yields
fall
and
rising
carbon
dioxide
levels
in
the
air
slash
nutrients
in
staple
foods
she
added
inia
seruiratu
fiji
s
minister
of
agriculture
and
disaster
management
said
his
pacific
island
nation
was
already
experiencing
the
effects
of
climate
change
on
health
such
as
an
increase
in
diseases
after
storms
and
floods
it
is
working
to
build
health
clinics
that
can
also
withstand
strong
winds
and
other
extreme
weather
he
noted
despite
such
efforts
the
who
report
said
financial
support
particularly
for
small
island
nations
and
the
poorest
countries
remains
woefully
inadequate
only
about
percent
of
funds
provided
by
international
institutions
for
measures
to
adapt
to
climate
change
have
been
allocated
to
health
projects
it
added
money
is
also
lacking
for
scientific
research
into
the
different
options
for
tackling
the
problem
ebi
said
if
countries
do
not
ramp
up
efforts
to
protect
their
people
s
health
on
a
warming
planet
the
battle
is
likely
to
end
up
in
the
courts
warned
who
s
neira
that
is
already
happening
lawyers
and
plaintiffs
in
climate
change
legal
cases
told
reporters
on
the
sidelines
of
the
talks
in
the
polish
city
of
katowice
in
switzerland
for
example
a
lawsuit
has
been
filed
on
behalf
of
about
elderly
women
who
are
challenging
the
government
s
emissions
reduction
policy
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
vulnerable
to
heatwaves
exacerbated
by
climate
change
and
in
an
ongoing
court
case
filed
against
the
government
health
experts
have
diagnosed
plaintiffs
with
asthma
linked
to
air
pollution
and
emotional
trauma
caused
by
climate
stresses
group
member
vic
barrett
said
in
poland
it
is
not
just
about
saving
the
planet
and
the
glaciers
in
the
future
it
is
about
protecting
the
health
of
the
people
