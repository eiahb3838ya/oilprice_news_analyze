for
such
a
project
in
the
world
s
lng
exporter
the
proposals
have
come
after
three
new
lng
export
plants
on
the
east
coast
have
sucked
gas
out
of
the
southeastern

and
nearly
tripled
wholesale

said
it
had
signed
an
agreement
with
the
port
of
newcastle
to
do
preliminary
work
on
a
proposed
fsru
that
it
estimated
would
cost
up
to

including
onshore
infrastructure
we
are
confident
that
by
importing
lng
via
a
new

terminal
we
will
be
able
to
provide
an
infrastructure
solution
that
is
capable
of
delivering
a
source
of
alternative
gas
supplies
to
the
region

port
of
newcastle
the
world
s
largest
coal
export
terminal
said
the
plan
was
in
line
with
its
own
efforts
to
diversify
the
port
faces
the
decline
of
coal
exports
due
to
the
global
drive
to
cut
carbon
emissions
port
of
newcastle
is
uniquely
placed
as
a
deepwater
port
with
enviable
land
and
channel
capacity

declined
to
say
where
the
financing
for
newcastle
lng
would
come
from
the
million

million
cost
is
well
above
estimates
for
four
other
proposed
lng
import
projects
one
in
new
south
wales
two
in
the
state
of
victoria
and
one
in
south
australia
those
projects
aim
to
start
importing
lng
around
or
despite
a
report
by
the
australian
government
s
commodities
forecaster
in
july
saying
the
economics
might
not
work
as
it
might
be
difficult
to
find
cheap
lng
beyond
credit
suisse

saul
kavonic
said
there
was
not
enough
of
a
market
for
all
five
projects
to
go
ahead
