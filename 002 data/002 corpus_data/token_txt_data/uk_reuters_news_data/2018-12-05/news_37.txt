brussels
reuters
the
european
commission
published
on
wednesday
proposals
to
boost
the
role
of
the
euro
in
international
payments
and
its
use
as
a
reserve
currency
to
challenge
the
dominance
of
the
dollar
the
move
follows
the
decision
by
the
united
states
to
withdraw
from
an
agreement
with
iran
on
its
nuclear
program
that
has
forced
many
european
companies
to
stop
trading
with
iran
to
avoid
sanctions
the
european
commission
called
on
companies
and
states
to
increase
their
use
of
the
euro
in
energy
contracts
it
said
it
would
study
possible
measures
to
promote
the
european
union
currency
in
financial
and
commodity
markets
the
decision
to
use
a
currency
is
ultimately
made
by
market
participants
the
commission
acknowledged
the
most
effective
way
to
widen
the
euro
s
international
role
was
to
overhaul
the
currency
union
and
adopt
financial
reforms
that
have
been
blocked
for
years
by
conflicting
national
interests
in
the
years
since
its
adoption
the
euro
s
international
role
reached
its
peak
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
decade
its
use
dropped
during
the
financial
crisis
the
euro
has
not
recovered
since
and
the
dollar
remains
the
currency
most
used
in
the
world
sixty
percent
of
sovereign
debt
issuance
and
global
foreign
exchange
reserves
are
in
dollars
the
euro
is
the
second
global
currency
but
its
share
of
each
market
is
just
percent
the
commission
admitted
the
dollar
dominance
was
due
to
higher
liquidity
lower
transaction
costs
and
its
use
as
a
benchmark
in
commodities
and
derivatives
markets
prerogatives
that
can
hardly
be
challenged
in
the
short
term
but
it
argued
that
a
stronger
euro
would
be
positive
not
only
for
europe
but
also
for
the
wider
world
which
would
help
improve
the
resilience
of
the
international
financial
more
than
promotion
you
need
reforms
stability
and
convincing
investors
a
senior
central
banker
said
airing
widespread
doubts
at
the
european
central
bank
the
body
in
charge
of
the
euro
over
the
commission
plan
however
recent
trade
conflicts
and
the
use
of
the
dollar
as
an
instrument
to
force
sanctions
on
iran
have
raised
concern
in
other
countries
about
the
dollar
that
could
contribute
to
a
stronger
role
of
the
euro
eu
officials
admit
the
commission
pushed
for
strengthening
the
euro
s
role
in
international
payments
where
it
holds
a
global
share
similar
to
the
dollar
more
than
percent
the
eu
is
the
world
s
largest
energy
importer
with
an
average
import
bill
of
billion
euros
billion
the
commission
said
urging
eu
states
to
switch
to
a
default
use
of
the
euro
in
future
energy
international
agreements
it
said
it
would
also
consider
moves
to
increase
the
use
of
the
euro
by
aircraft
manufacturers
such
as
airbus
and
in
commodities
markets
in
the
financial
sector
the
eu
executive
said
it
could
propose
extending
the
scope
of
derivative
contracts
that
have
to
go
through
clearing
houses
in
a
bid
to
expand
the
market
in
financial
products
it
said
it
would
also
explore
measures
to
facilitate
an
ecb
plan
for
a
european
instant
payment
system
which
could
challenge
the
dominance
of
payment
cards
and
the
emerging
financial
role
of
digital
giants
in
payment
services
the
plan
was
proposed
by
the
ecb
last
week
but
so
far
only
eight
mostly
or
banks
from
spain
germany
and
france
have
signed
up
