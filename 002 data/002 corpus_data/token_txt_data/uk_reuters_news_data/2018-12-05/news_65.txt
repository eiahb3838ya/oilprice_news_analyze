indonesia
has
eased
rules
on
palm
oil
levies
and
derivative
products
following
a
drop
in
prices
according
to
a
finance
ministry
regulation
on
a
government
website
on
wednesday
an
effort
to
make
the
nation
s
palm
oil
exports
more
competitive
the
world
s
top
exporter
of
palm
oil
will
not
collect
levies
from
palm
exporters
when
prices
are
below
a
threshold
of
per
tonne
but
will
charge
a
tonne
once
prices
are
in
a
range
of
per
tonne
the
levy
will
rise
to
when
prices
hit
above
per
tonne
under
the
previous
rules
for
levies
exporters
paid
per
tonne
regardless
of
palm
price
levels
the
government
expects
that
by
lowering
the
levies
indonesian
exporters
can
set
more
competitive
prices
for
palm
oil
shipments
and
that
in
turn
will
help
local
palm
farmers
indonesia
also
imposes
export
taxes
on
crude
palm
oil
when
the
reference
price
is
above
per
tonne
the
rules
on
the
export
taxes
remain
unchanged
the
details
of
the
new
regulation
were
different
from
those
announced
last
week
darmin
nasution
coordinating
minister
for
economic
affairs
earlier
said
the
zero
levy
is
implemented
when
prices
are
below
per
tonne
asked
on
wednesday
about
the
difference
in
price
thresholds
nasution
said
it
was
due
to
the
adoption
of
the
trade
ministry
s
reference
price
for
the
regulation
the
government
will
use
the
trade
ministry
s
monthly
reference
price
in
deciding
the
levy
according
to
the
regulation
signed
on
the
monthly
reference
price
is
set
based
on
palm
prices
in
indonesia
malaysia
and
rotterdam
nasution
said
higher
crude
palm
oil
prices
in
rotterdam
means
the
government
has
to
increase
the
floor
price
for
exports
to
be
imposed
with
levies
the
trade
ministry
s
reference
price
for
december
stood
at
per

on

indonesia
collects
levies
from
palm
exporters
to
help
finance
the
development
of
its
biodiesel
programme
and
fund
replanting
nasution
said
last
week
a
rapid
drop
in
palm
prices
has
made
it
urgent
for
the
government
to
take
action
especially
to
help
palm
farmers
the
palm
benchmark
in
malaysia
hit
its
lowest
since
august
last
week
as
stocks
of
the
vegetable
oil
continue
to
remain
elevated
amid
soft
global
demands
this
is
a
good
move
for
indonesia
but
bad
for
malaysia
as
we
need
to
compete
with
them
