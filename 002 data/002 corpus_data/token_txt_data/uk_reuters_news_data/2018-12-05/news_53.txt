saudi
arabia
is
seeking
to
persuade
russia
on
wednesday
to
cut
oil
production
substantially
with
opec
next
year
in
an
attempt
to
arrest
a
decline
in
the
price
of
crude
and
prevent
another
global
glut
russian

minister
alexander
novak
was
due
later

holds
policy
talks
on
thursday
in

followed
by
a
gathering
with
allies
including

saudi
arabia
has
indicated
it
wants
opec
and
its
allies
to
cut
output
by
at
least
million
barrels
per
day
or
percent
of
global
production
riyadh
wants
moscow
to
contribute
at

the
cut
but
russia
insists
the
amount
should
be
only
half
of
that
opec

it
is
not
easy

we
will
always
work

a

to
the
russian

ministry
said
no
one
is
eager
to
cut
unless
there
is
an
emergency
it
is
the
united

where
we
are
seeing
the

letting
russia
saudi

and
the
united
states
have
been
vying
for
the
position
of
top
crude
producer
in
recent
years
the
united
states
is
not
part
of
any
initiative
due
to
its
strict
legislation
and
fragmented
oil
industry
crude
prices
have
sunk
since
october
due
to
global
economic
weakness
and
fears
of
a
glut
due
largely
to
rising
production
