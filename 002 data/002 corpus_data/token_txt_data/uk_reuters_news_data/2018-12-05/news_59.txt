reuters
chinese
oil
trader
unipec
plans
to
resume
crude
shipments
to
china
by
march
after
the
deal
at
the
meeting
reduced
the
risk
of
tariffs
being
imposed
on
these
imports
three
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
the
sources
told
reuters
that
unipec
trading
arm
of
state
refiner
sinopec
is
looking
to
import
oil
by
march
which
marks
the
end
of
a
negotiating
period
agreed
by
the
leaders
of
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
china
s
crude
oil
imports
from
the
united
states
ground
to
a
halt
in
october
as
this
year
s
trade
war
between
the
two
countries
escalated
chinese
buyers
who
want
to
buy
crude
will
rush
to
import
the
oil
during
this
window
a
senior
executive
from
asia
s
largest
refiner
sinopec
said
adding
that
the
oil
has
to
arrive
in
china
before
march
oil
prices
are
low
so
it
makes
economic
sense
to
store
some
crude
as
commercial
inventories
said
the
executive
who
asked
not
to
be
named
sinopec
said
it
has
a
policy
not
to
comment
on
specific
trade
deals
unipec
did
not
respond
to
an
email
oil
prices
have
slumped
by
around
a
third
since
early
october
amid
an
emerging
glut
triggering
expectations
that
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
will
agree
to
supply
cuts
at
a
meeting
this
week
it
was
unclear
how
much
oil
unipec
china
s
largest
crude
oil
importer
would
order
from
the
united
states
but
one
of
the
sources
said
the
company
could
lift
a
record
volume
of
oil
in
january
china
s
previous
record
for
a
month
came
in
january
when
it
imported
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
from
the
united
states
according
to
chinese
customs
data
before
the
trade
dispute
erupted
in
china
had
become
the
largest
importer
of
crude
china
imported
on
average
bpd
of
crude
in
the
first
nine
months
of
before
imports
fell
to
zero
in
october
customs
data
shows
although
crude
oil
was
not
included
on
beijing
s
import
tariff
list
chinese
buyers
started
avoiding
oil
from
trade
and
shipping
sources
said
unipec
is
back
in
the
market
looking
to
buy
crude
and
book
ships
for
china
unipec
may
have
chartered
vlcc
manifa
to
load
oil
this
month
one
of
the
sources
said
another
said
the
company
has
provisionally
booked
a
vlcc
to
load
oil
in
january
and
make
the
voyage
to
china
for
million
while
china
is
expected
to
maximize
oil
imports
during
the
window
the
overall
outlook
for
this
trade
flow
in
remained
murky
tensions
have
eased
between
the
two
countries
but
we
can
t
forecast
what
will
happen
after
march
the
sinopec
executive
said
there
is
a
lot
of
pressure
on
both
sides
to
reach
a
mutual
agreement
