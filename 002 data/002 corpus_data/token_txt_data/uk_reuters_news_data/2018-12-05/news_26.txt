delegates
say
it
is
tense
behind

developing
countries
seek
assurances
that
if
they
make
ambitious
cuts
to
their
climate
emissions
developed
countries
will

the
paris
deal
brazil

and
loudly
advocates
for
transparency
on
both
climate
action
and
financial
support
antonio

be
avoided
at
all

the
polish
official
leading
talks
to
revive
the
paris
climate
deal

vowed
not

deputy
environment
minister
michal

lessons
from
laurent
fabius
of
france
who
was
dubbed
laurent
fabulous
for
his
success
in
sealing
the
paris
accord
of
tuesday
concerns
mount
that
any
outcome
from
the
two

of

will
lack
ambition
because
of

polish

that
it
plans
to
build
more
coalmines

climate
inaction

poland
and
the
rest
of

we
can
not
go
down
this
road
of
madness
any
more
she

nations
to
deliver
on
an
existing
pledge
to
provide

a
year
from

help
poorer
countries
deal
with
climate
change
if
developed
economies
put
off
their
climate
payments
any
longer
the
paris
agreement
temperature
goals
will
slip
out
of
reach
with
tragic
consequences
for
people
and
planet
he
said
poland
and
britain

up
and
marched
through
the
streets
before
joining

and
feathered

rather
than
their
mining
helmets
monday
kurtyka
tells
the
conference
in
his
opening
address
katowice
is
the
logical
setting
to
agree
the
rules
for
a
transition
away
from
fossil
fuel
coal
and
steel
are
still
central
to
its
economy
but
it
has
also
developed
tourism
and
buildings
where
exhausted
miners
formerly
slept
off
their
shifts
are
now
elegant
restaurants
and
flats

told

he
wished
he
could
have
used
his
fictional
film
role
as
the
terminator
to
end
fossil
fuels
i
d
like
to
be
a
terminator
in
real
life
and
be
able
to
travel
back
in
time
and
to
stop
all
fossil
fuels
when
they
were
discovered
just
imagine
the
biggest
evil
is
fossil
fuels
schwarzenegger
said
polish
president
andrzej
duda
told
reporters
and
environmental
campaigners
polish
coal
reserves
would
last
for
another
years
he
said
it
was
poland
s
strategic
fuel
guaranteeing
energy
security
and
sovereignty
and
it
would
be
hard
not
to
use
it
the
reality
for
poland
though
is
coal
does
not
provide
all
its
needs
and
its
imports
from
russia
on
whom
it
already
depends
for

and
gas
have
been
rising

streets
local
citizens
are
and
often
cynical

retired
wife
of
a
former
coal
miner
said
the
climate

had
kept
her
awake
at
night
because
of
the
endless
police
sirens
accompanying
the
visiting
dignitaries
everybody
here
uses
coal
or
rubbish
to
heat
their
homes
in
the
evening
i
can
t
open
the
windows
because
of
the
smell
how
can
they
talk
about
ecology
here
there
is
no
ecology
here
or
in
poland
