government

is
the
main
reason
predictions
about

have

became
prominent
again
in

clayton
policymakers
responded
by
pressing
for
more
conservation
encouraging
the
development
of
overseas
reserves
reserving
domestic
supplies
for
future
military
needs
or
experimenting
with
alternatives
but
scarcity
forecasts
have
underestimated
the
impact
of
improvements
in
technology
mostly
driven
by
price
changes
of
which
shale
extraction
has
been
the
most
recent
and
dramatic
and
we
will
have
cooked
the
planet
through
global
warming
long
before
we
run
out
of
fossil
fuels
no
mineral
including
oil
will
ever
be
exhausted

of

out
of
the
bottle
if
and
when
the
cost
of
finding

extraction
goes
above
the
price
consumers
are
willing
to
pay
the
industry
will
begin
to
and
as
former
saudi
oil
minister
zaki
yamani
observed
in
oil
will
be
left
in
the
ground
the
stone
age
came
to
an
end
not
because
we
had
a
lack
of
stones
and
the
oil
age
will
come
to
an
end
not
because
we
have
a
lack
of
the
oil
age
too
will
end
if
and
when
it
is
replaced
by
a
superior
energy
source
just
as
mainframe
computers
buggy
whips
and
typewriters
have
all
been
largely
superseded
but
it
won
t
end

lack
of

these

and

in

as
well
as
the
amount
produced

in
amounted
to

of

surpassing
the
previous
peak
set
in
and
enough
to
sustain
production
at
current
rates
for
years

accounting

s
share
producers
also
added
almost
billion
barrels
of
additional
proved
reserves
in
the
section
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
oil
producers
added
billion
barrels
to
their
proved
reserves
last
year
as
a
result
of
new
field
discoveries
and
extensions
of
reserves
within
existing
fields
the
eia
says
they
also
added
another
billion
barrels
as
a
result
of
changed
estimates
of
what
they
can
produce
using
existing
technology
and
at
current
prices
and
costs
with
other
adjustments
adding
billion
barrels
reserve
additions
from
all
these
sources
combined
comfortably
outstripped
the
billion
barrels
of
oil
that
were
actually
produced
during
the
year
nobody
finds
a
reserve
just
as
nobody
finds
a
factory
according
to
adelman
oil
reserves
are
not
gifts
of
nature
they
represent
the
outcome
of
improvements
in
technology
and
heavy
investment
in
exploration
and
production
reserves
are
renewable
and
constantly
renewed
if
and
only
if
there
is
enough
inducement
to
invest
in
creating
them
the
inducement
depends
on
price
and
cost
adelman
wrote
proved
reserves
have
risen
and
fallen
broadly
in
line
with
contemporary
production
as
both
have
responded
to
the
same
price
signals
the
ratio
of
proved
reserves
to
contemporary
production
has
been
broadly
stable
at
between
and
years
since
at
least
the
late
most
reserve
additions
have
come
from
within
existing
fields
as
drilling
leads
to
better
understanding
of
the
extent
of
the
resource
new
strata
are
discovered
and
recovery
techniques
improve
for
example
california
s
kern
river
oilfield
was
thought
to
contain
just
million
more
barrels
of
oil
in
but
actually
produced
million
more
by
and
was
then
estimated
to
have
another
million
remaining
the
field
had
not
changed
but
knowledge
had
science
technology
and
not
least
the
detailed
geology
learned
by
development
adelman
wrote
at
any
given
moment
reserves
are
being
added
everywhere
the
reserve
increments
of
any
given
period
are
overwhelmingly
in
existing
fields
he
explained
the
constant
search
for
prospects
takes
the
industry
to
the
fringes
of
known
reservoirs
and
beyond
the
search
process
is
driven
by
cost
comparison
the
industry
is
a
great
instrument
scanning
all
deposits
old
and
new
to
develop
the
cheapest
increment
or
tranche
into
a
in
this
respect
shale
has
been
no
different
from
earlier
technological
breakthroughs
that
have
led
to
enormous
reserve
growth
mostly
within
existing
fields
