germany
s
transport
minister
said
on
wednesday
he
opposed
a
fuel
tax
on
diesel
to
encourage
a
shift
towards
cleaner
vehicles
but
manufacturers
should
speed
up
their
push
to
get
polluting
cars
off
the
road
through
incentives
for
customers
the
german
government
has
agreed
to
reduce
emissions
from
the
transport
sector
by
percent
but
it
remains
unclear
how
the
goal
will
be
achieved
andreas
scheuer
a
member
of
the
csu
bavarian
conservatives
said
he
favored
a
system
of
incentives
to
reduce
carbon
dioxide
emissions
rather
than
using
a
tax
on
fuels
like
the
one
favored
by
the
social
democratic
environment
minister
i
oppose
taxes
and
additional
burdens
he
told
reuters
german
carmakers
last
month
agreed
to
offer
up
to
euros
per
car
to
help
germany
clean
up
toxic
fumes
from
heavily
polluting
diesel
vehicles
as
part
of
a
last
ditch
effort
to
avoid
a
court
imposed
ban
on
diesel
vehicles
the
manufacturers
have
to
deliver
scheuer
said
in
an
interview
i
hope
that
the
pressure
in
the
market
leads
to
improvements
for
the
diesel
owners
the
government
can
t
impose
it
but
it
s
clear
the
german
manufacturers
would
be
to
win
back
the
trust
of
the
domestic
scheuer
also
faulted
the
industry
for
lackluster
progress
on
developing
alternative
propulsion
systems
such
as
electric
cars
despite
the
fact
that
the
government
had
spent
around
billion
euros
on
such
programs
too
little
has
happened
there
he
said
the
customers
need
functioning
vehicles
and
not
studies
and
not
pilot
programs
that
can
be
shown
off
at
car
car
owners
can
older
vehicles
for
cleaner
newer
ones
or
opt
for
cumbersome
retrofits
of
more
effective
exhaust
filtering
systems
at
a
later
stage
the
global
reputation
of
germany
s
car
industry
has
been
tarnished
by
a
series
of
scandals
involving
schemes
to
conceal
the
true
levels
of
pollutant
emissions
from
diesel
cars
the
government
has
been
pushing
german
carmakers
volkswagen
daimler
and
bmw
and
foreign
manufacturers
to
take
quicker
action
to
get
polluting
cars
off
the
road
he
said
many
asian
manufacturers
were
moving
ahead
far
more
quickly
to
build
large
numbers
of
alternative
vehicles
while
german
firms
were
still
building
just
small
numbers
