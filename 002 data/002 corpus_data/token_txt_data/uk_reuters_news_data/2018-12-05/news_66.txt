the
french
government
could
change
its
position
regarding
a
wealth
tax
said
government
spokesman
benjamin
griveaux
as
protests
mount
over
president
emmanuel
macron
s
policies
the
government
has
changed
aspects
of
the
wealth
tax
known
in
france
as
the
isf
by
narrowing
it
down
to
lucrative
property
deals
and
real
estate
assets
however
that
move
had
led
to
criticism
that
macron
was
a
president
of
the
rich
since
it
would
have
eased
the
tax
burden
for
many
of
the
country
s
wealthiest
citizens
on
wednesday
griveaux
told
rtl
radio
the
government
could
those
proposals
if
it
felt
the
move
was
not
working
if
a
measure
that
we
have
taken
which
is
costing
the
public
money
turns
out
not
to
be
working
if
it
s
not
going
well
we
re
not
stupid
we
would
change
it

week

least

months

response
to
weeks
of
sometimes
violent
protests
marking

first
major
by
