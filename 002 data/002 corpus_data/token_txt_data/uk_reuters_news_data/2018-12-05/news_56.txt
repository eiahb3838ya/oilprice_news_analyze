wrapup 3-china confident it can clinch u.s. trade pact, trump demands "real deal"
shanghai
reuters
china
expressed
confidence
on
wednesday
that
it
can
reach
a
trade
deal
with
the
united
states
a
sentiment
echoed
by
president
donald
trump
a
day
after
he
warned
of
more
tariffs
if
the
two
sides
could
not
resolve
their
differences
the
remarks
by
the
chinese
commerce
ministry
follow
a
period
of
relative
quiet
from
beijing
after
trump
and
chinese
leader
xi
jinping
reached
a
temporary
truce
in
their
trade
war
at
a
meeting
over
dinner
in
argentina
on
saturday
in
a
brief
statement
the
ministry
said
china
would
try
to
work
quickly
to
implement
specific
items
already
agreed
upon
as
both
sides
actively
promote
the
work
of
negotiations
within
days
in
accordance
with
a
clear
timetable
and
road
map
we
are
confident
in
implementation
it
said
calling
the
latest
bilateral
talks
very
successful
trump
in
a
post
on
twitter
linked
beijing
s
silence
to
officials
travels
and
said
he
thought
xi
had
been
sincere
during
their
weekend
meeting
to
hammer
out
progress
over
trade
very
strong
signals
being
sent
by
china
once
they
returned
home
from
their
long
trip
including
stops
from
argentina
not
to
sound
naive
or
anything
but
i
believe
president
xi
meant
every
word
of
what
he
said
at
our
long
and
hopefully
historic
meeting
all
subjects
discussed
trump
wrote
on
wednesday
the
president
a
day
earlier
had
said
the
ceasefire
could
be
extended
but
warned
tariffs
would
be
back
on
the
table
if
the
talks
failed
and
that
he
would
only
accept
a
real
deal
with
china
china
s
foreign
ministry
referred
specific
questions
to
the
commerce
ministry
which
is
due
to
hold
its
weekly
news
briefing
on
thursday
in
beijing
we
hope
the
two
working
teams
from
both
sides
can
based
on
the
consensus
reached
between
the
two
countries
leaders
strengthen
consultations
and
reach
a
mutually
beneficial
agreement
soon

spokesman
geng
shuang
told
reporters
the
threat
of
further
escalation
in
the
trade
war
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
has
loomed
large
over
financial
markets
and
the
global
economy
for
much
of
the
year
and
investors
initially
greeted
the
ceasefire
with
relief
the
mood
has
quickly
soured
however
on
scepticism
that
the
two
sides
can
reach
a
substantive
deal
on
a
host
of
highly
divisive
issues
within
the
negotiating
period
and
markets
continued
to
slide
on
wednesday
in
part
from
confusion
over
the
ceasefire
s
lack
of
detail
failure
would
raise
the
specter
of
a
major
escalation
in
the
trade
battle
with
fresh
tariff
action
and
chinese
retaliation
possibly
as
early
as
march
the
white
house
has
said
china
had
committed
to
start
buying
more
american
products
and
lifting
tariff
and
barriers
immediately
while
beginning
talks
on
structural
changes

the

narrow
agreements
and
modest
concessions
in

remain
contentious
officials
from
the
united
states
and
a
number
of
other
major
economies
have
often
criticized
china
for
its
slow
approach
to
negotiations
and
not
following
through
on
commitments
china
has
said
comparatively
little
about
the
agreement
after
senior
chinese
officials
briefed
the
media
following
the
meeting
and
and
chinese
accounts
of
what
the
deal
entails
have
sometimes
differed
officials
now
face
the
difficult
task
of
fleshing
out
a
deal
that
is
acceptable
to
the
chinese
but
also
involves
significant
enough
concessions
not
to
be
torpedoed

the
china
hawks

most
senior

on
wednesday
the

newspaper
said
the
trump
administration
s
statements
about
the
deal
including
the
agreement
that
china
would
buy
trillion
in
additional
goods
were
designed
to
highlight
or
even
exaggerate
facets
of
the
deal
that
benefited
the
united
states
it
will
be
a
situation
if
a
deal
is
realized
but
if
not
more
fights
and
talks
will
continue
alternately
for
a
longer
while
chinese
society
should
maintain
a
calm
attitude
