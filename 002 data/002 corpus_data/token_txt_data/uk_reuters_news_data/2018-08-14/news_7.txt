japanese
utilities
and
global
mining
giant
glencore
have
settled
an
australian
thermal
coal
import
contract
for
april
at
a
tonne
according
to
several
people
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
the
deals
were
struck
between
glencore
and
japanese
utilities
such
as
shikoku
electric
chugoku
electric
and
kansai
electric
after
bilateral
talks
a
source
at
a
japanese
coal
buyer
said
requesting
anonymity
as
he
was
not
allowed
to
speak
in
public
about
commercial
deals
glencore
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
a
chugoku
electric
spokesman
confirmed
the
utility
struck
some
annual
contracts
at
a
tonne
with
glencore
but
said
other
deals
were
agreed
at
different
levels
or
prices
shikoku
electric
said
it
settled
the
contract
with
glencore
last
month
but
declined
to
disclose
the
price
kansai
electric
declined
to
comment
we
ve
agreed
with
glencore
at
per
tonne
for
the
contract
late
last
month
said
another
source
at
a
utility
directly
involved
in
the
talks
also
declining
to
be
named
a
trader
with
a
major
commodity
merchant
also
confirmed
the
deals
the
deal
marks
a
breakthrough
after
japan
s
tohoku
electric
and
glencore
the
world
s
biggest
exporter
of
seaborne
thermal
coal
failed
earlier
this
year
to
agree
an
annual
supply
deal
that
has
in
the
past
been
used
as
an
industry
benchmark
the
contractual
price
came
in
nearly
percent
higher
than
an
annual
supply
price
a
year
earlier
and
percent
above
a
deal
for
october
reflecting
a
tighter
global
market
for
the
world
s
dominant
power
generation
fuel
australian
spot
thermal
coal
cargo
prices
have
hit
several
highs
in
recent
months
and
at
per
tonne
remain
a
third
above
this
year
s
lows
in
april
pushed
up
by
a
summer
heatwave
across
the
northern
hemisphere
as
well
as
output
cuts
in
china
the
world
s
biggest
consumer
of
coal
the
deals
between
japanese
utilities
and
glencore
give
coal
markets
welcome
clarity
after
tohoku
and
glencore
abandoned
their
talks
on
an
annual
contract
that
traditionally
set
prices
for
the
region
with
annual
imports
of
around
million
tonnes
japan
is
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
importers
of
thermal
coal
its
utilities
buy
around
percent
of
all
australian
thermal
coal
exports
but
volumes
under
the
contract
have
been
declining
as
utilities
try
to
diversify
supply
sources
and
trade
more
in
the
spot
market
as
part
of
japan
s
energy
market
liberalisation
still
miners
say
term
contracts
will
remain
important
end
users
like
to
have
a
mix
of
spot
exposure
and
they
like
to
have
some
certainty
in
their
portfolios
as
i
have
to
say
producers
also
benefit
from
paul
flynn
chief
executive
at
whitehaven
coal
said
in
an
earnings
conference
call
on
tuesday
japan
is
whitehaven
s
biggest
customer
despite
the
gyrations
that
you
ve
seen
over
the
last
months
and
two
years
in
particular
with
the
setting
of
those
prices
i
think
both
sides
of
that
equation
continue
to
have
a
commitment
to
maintain
both
pricing
in
a
sign
the
practice
of
buyers
and
miners
bilaterally
working
out
a
fixed
price
will
continue
tohoku
and
glencore
have
already
begun
preliminary
talks
on
an
october
annual
contract
