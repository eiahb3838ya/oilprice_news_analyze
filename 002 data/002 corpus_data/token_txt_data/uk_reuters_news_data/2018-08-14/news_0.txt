hardcore hedge fund bulls say iran sanctions may see oil at $150
london

clouds
are
gathering
over
the
outlook
for
the
oil
market
as
trade
tensions
and
rising
crude
supply
threaten
to
swamp
demand
growth
but
some
of
the
world
s
most
prominent
energy
investors
are
convinced
the
price
will
return
to
record
highs
the
escalating
trade
war
between
the
united
states
and
china
threatens
global
growth
the
physical
markets
are
already
showing
signs
of
strain
as
unwanted
crude
builds
on
ships
and
crushes
prices
for
cargoes
of
oil
aside
from
that
interest
rates
around
the
world
are
rising
and
the
dollar
is
strengthening
which
means
emerging
market
oil
buyers
are
seeing
their
import
bill
growing
almost
daily
both
opec
and
the
international
energy
agency
have
warned
about
the
risk
of
trade
disputes
to
global
demand
growth
in
their
most
recent
monthly
market
outlooks
funds
have
cut
their
bullish
bets
on
brent
and
crude
futures
and
options
to
their
lowest
in
almost
a
year
despite
all
this
prominent
hedge
funds
such
as
andurand
capital
and
westbeck
capital
are
betting
oil
could
skyrocket
to
a
barrel
from
around
now
the
main
driver
is
expected
to
be
upcoming
sanctions
on
iran
s
energy
sector
which
kick
in
november
our
view
is
that
by
november
we
will
have
lost
between
and
million
barrels
of
output
a
day
it
is
a
very
big
number
that
s
based
on
the
view
that
the
will
allow
a
few
temporary
exception
waivers
ultimately
we
could
see
losses
from
iran
exceed
million
barrels
a
day

from
a
nuclear
deal
between
world
powers
and

that
he
said
was
in
iran
s
favour
trump
has
also
blamed
opec
for
the
rise
in
oil
prices
over
the
last
months
and

june
exchanged
sharp
words
with
iran
on
the

out
opec

its

real
issue

within
two
years

don
t
sense
a
great
deal
of
engagement
yet
from
generalist
investors
a
few
of
them
are
starting
to
look
at
it
now

smith

chief

officer
said
this
is
going
to
catch
everybody
by
surprise
some
of
the
specialists
are
bullish
including
pierre
andurand
ourselves
and
energy
aspects
he
said
aside
from
the
risk
to
iranian
supply
venezuela
s
crude
production
which
has
already
collapsed
as
a
result
of
economic
crisis
could
fall

smith
said
andurand
capital
declined
to
comment
taking
a
contrarian
view
can
be
costly
even
andurand
took
a
hit
in
when
he
expected
the
oil
price
to
rally
sharply
and
instead
it
wallowed
around
the
mark
and
he
wasn
t
alone
a
number
of
oil
investors
such
as
commodity
fund
manager
andy
hall
were
reportedly
so
badly
burned
they
shut
up
shop
and
bowed

according
to
data
compiled
by
hsbc
the
oil
options
market
shows
that
for
contracts
from
october
to
december
traders
and
investors
are
holding
more
contracts
to
buy
crude
futures
or
calls
at
a
barrel
than
any
other
however
in
line
with
westbeck
s
view
that
oil
is
not
one
that
is
widely
shared
in
the
investment
community
that
position
has
barely
changed
in
the
last
month
having
dropped
by
a
mere

to
