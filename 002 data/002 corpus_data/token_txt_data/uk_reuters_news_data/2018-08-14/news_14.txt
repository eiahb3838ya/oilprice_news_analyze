oil

weighed
down
by
a

remained
concerned
about
the
financial
crisis
in
turkey
brent

dipped
cents
to
settle
at

barrel
while
west

wti
crude
futures
fell
cents
to
close
at
a

futures
extended
losses
in
trade
after
data
from
industry
group
the
american
petroleum
institute
showed
that
crude
stocks
unexpectedly
rose
by
million
barrels
last
week
compared
with
analysts
expectations
for
a
decrease
of
million
barrels
earlier
in
the
session
oil
prices
rose
supported
by
gains
in
equity
markets
but
pared
gains
at
as
the
dollar
index
touched
its
highest
since
late
june
a
stronger
dollar
makes
oil
more
expensive
for
holders
of
other
currencies
usually
when
the
dollar
starts
making
highs
it
s
probably
a
sign
that
we
re
still
concerned
about
the
turkish
situation
said
phil
flynn
analyst
at
price
futures
group
in
chicago
there
s
still
a
bit
of
nervousness
on
the
global
stock
indexes
broadly
gained
and
turkey
lira
recovered
a
day
after
crashing
to
an
low
against
the
dollar
feeding
worries
that
the
country
crisis
might
spread
to
other
emerging
markets
the
equities
and
the
dollar
are
keying
primarily
off
of
the
unfolding
saga
in
turkey
and
although
the
lira
has
posted
a
significant
rebound
today
the
standoff
between
turkey
and
the
is
showing
no
sign
of
progress
jim
ritterbusch
president
of
ritterbusch
and
associates
said
in
a
note
consequently
worries
over
contagion
are
apt
to
increase
in
the
process
of
reducing
risk
appetite
and
renewing
downside
pressures
on
oil
oil
s
losses
were
capped
by
concerns
over
lower
global
crude
supply
from
top
producers
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
said
on
monday
that
saudi
arabia
had
cut
production
export
declines
from
iran
also
are
expected
as
washington
sanctions
but
opec
expects

by
countries
outside
the
cartel
to
increase
by
million
bpd
next
year
bpd
more
than
forecast
last
month
boosted
by
new
shale
production
we
do
have
a
tighter
fundamental
picture
right
now
than
we
had
a
year
ago

vice

energy
in

you
continue
to
see
signs
that
demand
is
pretty
however
some
analysts
say
trade
disputes
between
the
united
states
and
china
and
turmoil
in
emerging
markets
could
curb
energy
demand
china

economy
is
showing
signs

seven
months
of
