a
statue
of
a
child
wearing
what
appears
to
be
a
hazardous
material
suit
unveiled
near
the
site
of
a
japanese
nuclear
disaster
has
drawn
a
barrage
of
criticism
from
residents
and
forced
the
sculptor
to
apologise
the
high
statue
sun
child
was
put
up
in
the
city
of
fukushima
north
of
tokyo
this
month
and
shows
a
child
in
what
appears
to
be
a
bright
yellow
hazmat
suit
holding
a
helmet
in
one
arm
on
the
child
s
chest
is
a
radiation
counter
reading
zero
a
major
earthquake
and
tsunami
on
march
led
to
meltdowns
at
the
fukushima
nuclear
power
plant
the
world
s
worst
nuclear
disaster
since
the
chernobyl
accident
in
many
thousands
of
people
were
displaced
by
leaking
radiation
and
many
have
still
been
unable
to
return
home
residents
said
the
statue
would
only
prolong
the
painful
memories
of
an
accident
that
seemed
destined
to
forever
link
the
name
fukushima
with
nuclear
disaster
i
don
t
think
fukushima
will
be
able
to
escape
from
its
tainted
reputation
so
i
understand
what
the
sculptor
wanted
to
say
said
ikue
tsunoda
however
residents
don
t
wear
hazmat
suits
so
i
think
that
was
provocative
she
said
sculptor
kenji
yanobe
said
he
had
worked
on
the
theme
of
radioactivity
since
as
a
way
of
showing
how
difficult
it
was
for
humans
to
deal
with
nuclear
power
he
said
he
wanted
to
show
the
air
was
now
safe
the
child
in
is
shown
with
the
helmet
off
and
the
counter
on
its
chest
points
to
zero
though
he
said
he
was
sorry
the
work
had
disturbed
people
i
sincerely
apologise
to
those
who
were
upset
by
my
artwork
yanobe
said
in
a
statement
on
his
website
city
officials
sought
to
smooth
over
the
controversy
the
statue
represents
the
future
free
from
nuclear
disaster
said
mariko
furukawa
manager
of
the
city
s
board
of
education
some
people
were
killed
by
the
earthquake
most
of
them
by
the
tsunami
waves
that
swept
ashore
