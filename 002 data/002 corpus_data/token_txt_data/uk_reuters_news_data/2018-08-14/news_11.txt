reuters
oil
and
gas
producer
diamondback
energy
inc
on
tuesday
agreed
to
buy
shale
rival
energen
corp
in
an
deal
valued
at
billion
giving
it
an
expanded
footprint
in
the
country
s
largest
and
fastest
growing
oil
field
energen
had
been
under
pressure
from
activist
investor
corvex
management
for
more
than
a
year
to
sell
itself
to
address
weak
returns
the
proposed
acquisition
is
diamondback
s
second
in
the
permian
in
a
week
after
striking
a
deal
to
pay
billion
for
ajax
resources
llc
west
texas
shale
producers
also
are
facing
pressure
to
expand
scale
and
efficiency
in
the
permian
basin
as
higher
costs
for
services
and
the
need
to
secure
limited
pipeline
transport
out
of
the
region
weigh
on
smaller
and
midsize
companies
the
deal
values
energen
s
properties
at
about
per
acre
hectare
among
the
highest
prices
in
the
permian
in
the
last
several
years
said
andrew
dittmar
an
m
a
analyst
at
data
provider
drillinginfo
concho
resources
inc
earlier
this
year
paid
billion
in
stock
or
more
than
per
acre
for
west
texas
shale
rival
rsp
permian
the
purchase
brings
together
two
companies
with
holdings
in
the
same
areas
of
the
permian
said
dittmar
potentially
allowing
for
longer
horizontal
wells
shared
labor
and
equipment
for
independent
oil
producers
like
diamondback
adding
new
drilling
prospects
represents
the
best
way
to
compete
for
services
with
larger
rivals
that
have
moved
into
the
permian
this
year
despite
pressure
by
investors
to
focus
on
shareholder
returns
shale
producers
including
apache
corp
conocophillips
parsley
energy
and
pioneer
natural
resources
recently
have
increased
their
capital
budgets
as
oil
prices
have
held
above
a
barrel
exxon
mobil
corp
bp
plc
and
other
large
oil
companies
that
missed
out
on
in
the
early
years
of
the
shale
boom
are
also
boosting
shale
investments
using
historical
alliances
to
secure
a
larger
role
with
oilfield
service
and
pipeline
companies
in
the
permian
last
month
bp
agreed
to
pay
billion
its
largest
purchase
in
nearly
two
decades
to
acquire
assets
in
three
shale
basins
from
australian
mining

that
