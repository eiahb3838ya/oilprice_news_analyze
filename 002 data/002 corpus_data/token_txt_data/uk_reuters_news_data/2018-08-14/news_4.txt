last

brazilian
farmer
gustavo
lopes
sized
up
his
sugarcane
plantation
against
his
soybean
fields
he
looked
at
global
trends
including
rising
trade
tensions
and
a
stubborn
glut
then
he
tore
up
the
last
of
his
cane
fields
and
ditched
a
supply
contract
with
a
local
sugar
mill
lopes
planted
soybeans
across
his
farm
in
sao
paulo
state
a
bet
that
paid
off
earlier
this
month
when
chinese
buyers
loaded
up
on
south
american
soy
after
beijing
imposed
tariffs
on
beans
the
farmer
got
his
highest
price
ever
for
soybeans
it
was
unusual
for
this
time
of
year
lopes
said
in
an
interview
at
his
farm
where
he
s
prepping
to
plant
another
soy
crop
in
september
it
s
got
to
be
a
result
of
chinese
shifting
trade
flows
are
redefining
the
brazilian
landscape
spurring
more
farmers
to
align
their
crops
with
chinese
appetites
the
nation
s
soy
plantings
have
expanded
by
million
hectares
in
two
years
an
area
the
size
of
new
jersey
while
land
used
for
cane
shrank
by
nearly
hectares
according
to
government
data
china
s
growing
demand
for
meat
has
supercharged
soy
imports
for
animal
feed
the
asian
nation
paid
billion
last
year
for
million
tonnes
of
soybeans
from
brazil
nearly
half
its
output
and
up
from
million
tonnes
in
a
new
percent
chinese
tariff
on
soybeans
a
retaliation
for
levies
by
president
donald
trump
is
expected
to
boost
brazil
s
soy
exports
to
an
record
this
year
brazilian
soybean
exports
to
china
rose
to
nearly
million
tonnes
in
the
first
half
of
up
percent
from
a
year
ago
in
july
they
surged
percent
from
the
same
month
a
year
earlier
to
million
tonnes
brazil
s
grains
boom
has
it
rivaling
united
states
as
the
world
s
top
soy
producer
this
year
after
outpacing
exports
over
the
past
five
years
all
that
soy
is
eating
into
brazil
s
sugarcane
belt
which
is
reeling
from
sugar
prices
near
lows
chinese
sugar
tariffs
have
weighed
on
the
global
market
for
the
sweetener
as
developed
nations
continue
to
cut
back
consumption
we
lost
hectares
of
cane
area
to
grains
in
the
last
two
years
said
roberto
de
rezende
barbosa
chief
executive
of
nova
américa
one
of
the
largest
cane
growers
in
brazil
managing
hectares
rezende
said
he
had
seen
farmers
migrating
from
sugarcane
into
grains
in
nearly
every
state
where
both
crops
are
viable
the
crop
swap
is
catching
on
quickly
with
farmers
threatening
the
survival
of
cane
mills
they
once
supplied
about
cane
mills
have
closed
in
the
past
five
years
in
brazil
s
cane
region
about
that
remain
open
must
fight
harder
than
ever
to
secure
cane
supplies
agroconsult
an
agribusiness
consultancy
said
it
has
received
requests
from
mills
to
calculate
the
premium
they
will
have
to
pay
producers
to
keep
them
from
switching
to
grains
douglas
duarte
a
director
at
the
londra
mill
in
itaí
which
used
to
lease
part
of
the
lopes
farm
said
he
has
plans
to
add
tonnes
of
capacity
at
the
mill
but
has
yet
to
line
up
enough
cane
supplies
with
so
many
farmers
focused
on
grain
duarte
has
worked
to
sign
leases
with
families
who
are
not
interested
in
actively
managing
their
land
in
places
where
the
owners
have
expertise
with
grains
the
equipment
and
everything
then
you
can
t
compete
he
said
in
some
places
the
closing
of
cane
mills
has
also
discouraged
planting
farmer
antonio
de
morais
ribeiro
neto
gave
up
planting
cane
last
year
after
the
closure
of
the
sugar
mill
that
he
supplied
called
usina
maracaju
biosev
sa
the
brazilian
sugar
arm
of
global
commodities
trader
louis
dreyfus
co
shut
it
down
in
a
move
so
riberio
replaced
hectares
of
cane
with
soybeans
adding
to
the
hectares
of
soy
he
already
had
planted
as
he
watched
the
trade
war
escalate
he
bought
two
new
grain
silos
more
machinery
and
a
new
harvester
plenty
of
sugar
mills
which
often
grow
part
of
the
cane
they
process
have
realized
they
can
not
fight
the
soy
boom
and
decided
to
plant
their
own
soybeans
as
part
of
a
crop
rotation
strategy
cane
fields
typically
need
to
be
replanted
after
five
or
six
years
and
mills
are
using
the
renovation
window
to
produce
soybeans
in
the
past
those
areas
subject
to
renovation
would
be
left
fallow
until
the
following
year
said
victor
campanelli
who
has
exploited
the
niche
his
firm
agro
pastoril
paschoal
campanelli
manages
the
planning
inputs
and
equipment
for
sugar
mills
soy
crops
sharing
in
the
profits
while
the
grains
bonanza
has
many
farmers
flush
with
cash
some
are
wary
about
relying
so
much
on
one
crop
and
one
massive
importer
this
chinese
demand
has
attracted
all
the
farmers
said
marcos
cesar
brunozzi
who
switched
part
of
his
land
from
sugar
to
grains
in
the
state
of
minas
gerais
i
hope
the
whole
situation
doesn
t
change
suddenly
because
we
are
betting
lopes
has
no
regrets
about
tearing
up
his
cane
fields
last
year
his
sugarcane
yielded
a
net
profit
of
reais
per
hectare
compared
to
reais
per
hectare
for
his
soy
fields
i
know
it
won
t
always
be
that
way
he
said
but
still
it
s
