world
share
markets
fought
to
regain
their
footing
on
tuesday
as
turkey
s
lira
pulled
out
of
its
recent
nosedive
and
reassuring
data
from
germany
helped
offset
the
latest
wobbles
in
china
s
giant
economy
after
three
weeks
of
heavy
pounding
turkey
s
lira
finally
got
some
respite
as
signs
the
country
s
authorities
were
trying
to
address
the
situation
triggered
a
percent
relief
rally
to
per
dollar
yet
it
had
lost
almost
percent
on
monday
alone
and
nerves
were
briefly
tested
again
as
turkey
s
president
tayyip
erdogan
urged
turks
to
boycott
electronic
products
in
response
to
recent
criticism
from
washington
the
rot
also
stopped
for
the
south
african
rand
the
russian
rouble
and
the
brazilian
real
argentina
s
central
bank
unexpectedly
raised
interest
rates
by
percentage
points
on
monday
even
so
the
peso
hit
a
record
low
these
things
get
very
volatile
in
both
directions
once
you
have
had
a
really
big
move
saxo
bank
s
head
of
fx
strategy
john
hardy
said
to
suggest
this
thing
is
over
you
would
have
to
see
that
turkey
is
isolated
i
m
not
there
yet
and
i
don
t
think
the
market
is
there
european
shares
also
steadied
after
two
days
of
selling
as
anxieties
over
contagion
from
the
turkish
currency
crisis
eased
after
falling
to
a
low
on
monday
euro

bank
stocks
initially
rose
before
slipping
back
again
while
the
stoxx
benchmark
and
wall
street
futures
both
climbed
sentiment
was
helped
as
data
showed
that
europe
s
largest
economy
germany
picked
up
more
steam
than
expected
in
although
the
markets
bounce
might
have
been
stronger

surveys
from

not
proved
softer
than
expected
chinese
retail
sales
industrial
output
and
urban
investment
all
grew
by
less
than
forecast
in
july
a
triple
dose
of
disappointment
that
underlined
the
argument
for
more
policy
stimulus
in
china
as
trade
risks
also
intensify
the

down

threshold
generally
accepted
to
be

market
the
more
significant
concern
relates
to
the
risk
that
regional
underperformance
becomes
a
source
of
disruption
through
swings
in
capital
flows

currencies
said
matt
sherwood
head
of

strategy
at
perpetual
while
the
focus
at
present
is
on
turkey
where
currency
depreciation
and
rising

has
translated
into
a
marked
tightening
of
financial
conditions
it
could
spread
to
mexico
brazil
and
sherwood
cited
the
nafta
negotiations
as
a
key
risk
for
mexico
and
upcoming
elections
in
brazil
and

as
potential
threats
