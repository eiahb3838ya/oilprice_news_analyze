malaysian
prime
minister
mahathir
mohamad
arrives
in
china
on
friday
seeking
to
renegotiate
and
perhaps
cancel
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
projects
entangled
in
domestic
graft
probes
ties
have
been
strained
since
a
stunning
election
victory
returned
mahathir
to
power
in
may
and
he
suspended
unpopular
chinese
projects
authorised
by
former
premier
najib
razak
during
his
rule
najib
courted
chinese
investment
and
was
a
cheerleader
for
president
xi
jinping
s
signature
belt
and
road
initiative
bri
in
southeast
asia
but
mahathir
has
vowed
to
discuss
the
unfair
deals
on
his
visit
where
we
can
drop
the
project
we
will
the
told
reporters
this
week
but
we
may
have
to
postpone
some
because
we
have
made
agreements
and
to
breach
the
agreements
will
cost
us
a
the
centrepiece
of
china
s
infrastructure
push
in
malaysia
is
the
ambitious
east
coast
rail
link
ecrl
project
work
on
which
has
been
suspended
pending
discussions
over
pricing
and
graft
accusations
hit
by
ballooning
costs
lack
of
transparency
and
the
risk
it
could
saddle
malaysia
with
uncomfortably
large
debt
the
project
has
come
to
symbolise
najib
s
administration
najib
charged
with
money
laundering
and
corruption
over
state
fund
development
berhad
has
denied
wrongdoing
and
pleaded
not
guilty
to
all
charges
during
his
election
campaign
mahathir
was
critical
of
the
benefits
of
the
chinese
projects
which
helped
him
win
his
government
also
halted
work
on
two
projects
worth
more
than
billion
awarded
to
the
china
petroleum
pipeline
bureau
that
have
been
linked
to
graft
at
china
has
been
very
spooked
by
mahathir
s
election
said
a
malaysian
official
familiar
with
talks
before
the
visit
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
china
is
nervous
that
malaysia
wants
to
cancel
the
projects
but
we
just
want
to
reassess
them
the
official
added
mahathir
s
trip
is
set
to
run
until
tuesday
but
he
will
first
visit
the
eastern
city
of
hangzhou
to
meet
giant
alibaba
s
chief
jack
ma
before
flying
to
beijing
the
source
said
china
s
eagerness
to
save
the
bri
from
another
embarrassing
setback
leads
some
analysts
to
believe
it
might
be
open
to
striking
a
pragmatic
compromise
with
malaysia
they
don
t
want
a
failure
to
taint
their
name
said
one
malaysian
source
involved
in
the
contract
reviews
they
don
t
want
to
be
involved
in
a
project
that
is
other
major
projects
that
have
hit
hurdles
include
a
rail
link
from
indonesia
s
capital
of
jakarta
to
southeastern
bandung
and
the
ports
of
hambantota
in
sri
lanka
and
gwadar
in
pakistan
the
chinese
are
open
to
ideas
and
negotiation
in
many
bri
countries
where
projects
run
into
problems
said
abdul
majid
ahmad
khan
president
of
kuala
lumpur
s
friendship
association
but
malaysia
has
to
be
clear
on
what
it
mahathir
has
courted
japan
in
recent
weeks
announcing
plans
for
a
big
loan
when
he
visited
tokyo
his
shift
away
from
china
is
also
seen
as
an
opportunity
for
the
united
states
worried
at
beijing
s
growing
regional
clout
and
building
of
islands
in
the
south
china
sea
but
for
malaysia
to
distance
itself
from
biggest
trading
partner
china
would
further
hurt
its
economy
sluggish
under
massive
debt
the
domestic
politics
and
change
in
government
delivered
a
shock
to
the
bilateral
relationship
at
the
very
least
it
has
increased
uncertainty
and
risk
said
pang
zhongying
an
international
relations
expert
at
the
ocean
university
of
china
adding
that
the
changes
had
inspired
caution
residents
of
malaysia
s
placid
coastal
town
of
kuantan
hoped
the
ecrl
launched
a
year
ago
would
boost
economic
activity
through
the
link
to
the
malacca
strait
a
key
shipping
lane
the
east
coast
people
want
the
ecrl
said
andy
chiew
a
official
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
but
for
now
the
project
has
hit
the
buffers
