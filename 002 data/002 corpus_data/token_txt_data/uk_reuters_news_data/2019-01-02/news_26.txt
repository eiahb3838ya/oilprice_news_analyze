sentiment
lost

much
as
percent
to
its

at
the
yen
extended
its
broad
rally
as
the

dropped
to
its

last

the

mixed
edging

steady
on
a
basket
of

at
the

has
been
dragged
by
a
steep
fall
in
treasury

in

as
investors
wagered
the
federal

would
not
raise

again
even
though
it
is
still
projecting
at

federal

will
have
the
chance

comment
on
the

yields
on

have
tumbled
to

barely
above

from
a
peak
of
percent
in
november
yields
on
notes
have
dived
to
their
lowest
since
last
february
at
percent
making
a
bullish
break
of
a
major
chart
level
at
percent
the
spread
between

yields
has
in
turn
shrunk
to
the
smallest
since
a
flattening

has
been
a
