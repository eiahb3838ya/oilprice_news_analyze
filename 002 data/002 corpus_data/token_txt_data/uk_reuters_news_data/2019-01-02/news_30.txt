wall

has

from
the

hint
of
progress
on
the
trade
standoff
though
details
were
still
notably
lacking
there
was
some
hope
of
progress
on
the
government
shutdown
after
president
donald
trump
invited
republican
and
democratic
congressional
leaders
to
a
border
security
briefing
however
it
was
not
clear
who
would
attend
the
meeting
which
was
set
for
later
on
wednesday
or
whether
a
deal
would
even
be
discussed
also

federal

chairman
jerome
powell
will
have
the
chance
to
comment
on
the
economic
outlook
when
he
participates
in
a
joint
discussion
with
former
fed
chairs
janet
yellen
and
ben
bernanke
on
friday
while
the
fed
is
still
projecting
two
or
more
rate
rises
this
year
investors
are
more
focussed
on
slowing
global
growth
and
the
disinflationary
pulse
from
sliding
oil
prices
fed
fund
futures
have
all
but
priced
out
any
hike
for
this
year
and
now
imply
a
quarter
point
cut
by
the
treasury
market
also
assumes
the
fed
is
done
and
dusted
yields
on
paper
have
tumbled
to
percent
just
barely
above
the
cash
rate
from
a
peak
of
percent
in
november
yields
on
notes
have
dived
to
their
lowest
since
last
february
at
percent
making
a
bullish
break
of
a
major
chart
level
at
percent
the
spread
between
and
yields
has
in
turn
shrunk
to
the
smallest
since
a
flattening
that
has
been
a
portent
of
recessions
in
the
past
what
is
clear
is
that
the
global
synchronised
growth
story
that
propelled
risk
assets
higher
has
come
to
the
end
of
its
current
run
the
treasury
team
at
ocbc
bank
wrote
in
a
note
inexorably
flattening
yield
curves
and
now
partially
inverted
yield
curve
have
poured
cold
water
on

policy
normalisation
going
the
breakneck
drop
in
yields
has
been
a
headwind
for
the
dollars
against
a
basket
of
currencies
it
was
stuck
at
having
fallen
for
two
weeks
straight
the
euro
was
firm
at
and
poised
for
another
attack
on
resistance
in
the
zone
a
band
that
has
held
since
late
october
against
the
yen
the
dollar
was
last
trading
at
and
near
its
lowest
since
june
last
year
the
pullback
in
the
dollar
and
the
chance
of
no
more
rate
hikes
has
been
a
boon
for
gold
the
precious
metal
fetched
an
ounce
to
be
close
to
a
peak
oil

with
a
tentative
bounce

punishing
