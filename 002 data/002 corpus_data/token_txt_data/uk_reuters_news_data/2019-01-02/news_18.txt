it
s
a
continuation
of
the
worries
over
growth
you
can
see
them
in
the
asian
numbers
which
all
confirm
that
we
have
passed
peak
growth
levels
said
tim
graf
chief
macro
strategist
at
state
street
global
advisors
the
effects
from
china
s
slowdown
and
global
trade
tensions
were
rippling
across
asia
and
europe
he
said
i
don
t
think
the
trade
story
goes
away
and
europe
being
an
open
economy
is
still
vulnerable
plus
there
is
less
monetary
policy
support
than
there
has
been
he
said
in
a
reference
to
the
european
central
bank
s
programme

ended

proxy
for
china
sentiment
the

fell
as
much
as
percent
to
its
lowest
since
february
at
there
were
also
renewed
fears
in

over

safety
the
stock
market
rout
drove
investors
into
the
safety
of
bonds
from
countries
such
as
the
united
states
and
germany
with
the
german
bund
yield
slumping
to
lows
of
percent
it
stood
at
percent
a
month
ago
this
drop
in
bund
yields
is
a
reflection
of
a
weakness
in
equities
and
overall
risk
sentiment
china
is
one
of
the
main
drivers
commerzbank
strategist
rainer
guntermann
said
gold
and
the
yen
were
he
other
beneficiaries
while
gold
topped
highs
the
yen
extended
its
rally
against
the
dollar
to
highs
around
it
strengthened
to
a
peak
against
the
euro
the
dollar
edged
up
on
the
euro
and
sterling
but
was
steady
versus
a
basket
of
currencies
at
the
greenback
has
been
dragged
down
by
a
steep
fall
in
treasury
yields
in
recent
weeks
investors
wager
the
federal
reserve
will
not
raise
rates
again
even
though
the
fed
itself
is
still
projecting
at
least
two
more

comment

yields
on

have
tumbled
to

just
barely
above
the
cash
rate
from
a
peak
of
percent
in
november
yields
have
dived
to
their
lowest
since
last
february
at
percent
the
spread
between
and
yields
has
in
turn
shrunk
to
the
smallest
since
a
flattening
that
has
been
a
portent
of
recessions
in
the
past
the
german
yield
curve
is
the
flattest
since
november
what
is
clear
is
that
the
global
synchronised
growth
story
that
propelled
risk
assets
higher
has
come
to
the
end
of
its
current
run
