foundation
in
a
bid
to
freshen
its
air
and
cut
emissions
the
pakistani
port
city
of
karachi
will
introduce
buses
powered
by
a
decidedly
unclean
fuel
cow
poo
with
funding
from
the
international
green
climate
fund
karachi
will
launch
a
green
bus
rapid
transit
brt
network
with
buses
fuelled
by
locals
said
the
new
bus
system
due
to
start
operating
in
would
help
reduce
air
pollution
and
street
noise
but
doubted
whether
it
would
have
enough
buses
to
resurrect
the
city
s
ailing
transport
system
karachi
s
public
transport
system
has
totally
collapsed
and
most
people
have
to
use
online
services
and
auto
rickshaws
said
commuter
afzal
ahmed
who
works
as
a
medical
sales
representative
after
management
problems
forced
the
karachi
transport
corporation
to
fold
some
two
decades
ago
buses
running
on
compressed
natural
gas
fell
into
disrepair
and
were
taken
off
the
road
worsening
public
transport
woes
he
noted
malik
amin
aslam
advisor
on
climate
change
to
pakistan
prime
minister
imran
khan
said
the
brt
system
was
the
first
transport
project
the
green
climate
fund
had
approved
and
would
bring
multiple
environmental
and
economic
benefits
it
would
not
require
operating
subsidies
he
added
the
cheap
clean
bus
network
will
cater
for
passengers
daily
and
will
reduce
emissions
by
million
tonnes
of
carbon
dioxide
equivalent
over
years
according
to
project
documents
the
brt
will
consist
of
a
corridor
that
will
benefit
million
residents
adding
new
bus
stations
secure
pedestrian
crossings
improved
sidewalks
cycle
lanes
and
facilities
the
green
climate
fund
set
up
under
climate
talks
to
provide
finance
to
developing
countries
to
help
them
grow
cleanly
and
adapt
to
a
warming
climate
will
provide
million
for
the
karachi
project
out
of
a
total
cost
of
million
the
other
major
funders
are
the
asian
development
bank
and
the
provincial
government
of
sindh
where
karachi
is
located
the
brt
system
to
be
rolled
out
over
four
years
will
have
a
fleet
of
hybrid
buses
that
will
run
on
produced
from
manure
excreted
by
karachi
s
water
buffaloes
and
collected
by
the
authorities
the
project
will
prevent
about
tonnes
of
cow
manure
entering
the
ocean
daily
by
converting
it
into
energy
and
fertiliser
at
a
biogas
plant
and
will
save
more
than
gallons
of
fresh
water
now
used
to
wash
that
waste
into
the
bay
aslam
said
ali
tauqeer
sheikh
ceo
of
leadership
for
environment
and
development
lead
pakistan
a
policy
said
calculating
the
overall
impact
on
the
environment
was
complex
as
the
buses
would
be
introduced
in
stages
pakistan
s
authorities
often
lack
maintenance
budgets
he
noted
highlighting
the
risk
the
buses
could
break
down
and
not
be
repaired
pakistan
has
a
history
that
it
does
not
utilise
donors
project
funding
at
an
optimum
level
he
said
but
if
all
goes
well
sheikh
said
the
project
as
the
country
s
first
green
brt
system
would
lay
the
foundation
for
urban
transportation
systems
in
other
places
it
could
shake
up
approaches
to
public
transport
among
policy
makers
and
planners
serving
as
a
model
for
other
cities
including
lahore
multan
peshawar
and
faisalabad
he
said
pakistan
needs
to
launch
such
projects
in
big
cities
to
discourage
personal
vehicle
use
thereby
easing
traffic
emissions
and
smog
and
improving
air
quality
and
public
health
sheikh
added
he
recommended
setting
a
target
for
percent
of
the
urban
population
to
use
public
transport
another
way
to
ease
air
pollution
would
be
to
import
petroleum
fuels
for
vehicles
he
added
we
are
importing
fuel
and
our
refineries
have
capacity
to
refine
only
fuel
he
said
ahmad
rafay
alam
an
environmental
lawyer
said
previous
brt
projects
in
pakistan
s
large
cities
had
not
focused
on
environmental
sustainability
planners
should
start
connecting
transport
systems
with
wider
urban
development
alam
said
we
need
to
introduce
urban
design
by
encouraging
the
use
of
public
transport
and
discouraging
the
use
of
private
vehicles
to
reduce
emissions
he
said
zia
ur
rehman
a
journalist
covering
civic
issues
noted
that
the
sindh
provincial
government
had
run
less
than
buses
in
the
city
in
the
last
years
while
private
buses
and
had
dwindled
from
to
one
reason
is
that
buses
were
torched
during
strikes
and
at
times
of
political
upheaval
he
said
the
new
bus
system
alone
was
unlikely
to
resolve
the
city
transport
problems
but
would
be
a
relief
for
commuters
and
also
help
in
reducing
air
pollution
