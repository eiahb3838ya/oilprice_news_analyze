update 3-opec sees slower 2019 oil demand growth, warns on economy
london
reuters
opec
on
wednesday
further
trimmed
its
forecast
for
global
oil
demand
growth
and
said
the
risk
to
the
economic
outlook
was
skewed
to
the
downside
adding
a
new
challenge
to
the
group
s
efforts
to
support
the
market
next
year
in
a
monthly
report
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
said
world
oil
demand
next
year
would
rise
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
bpd
less
than
last
month
and
the
second
consecutive
reduction
in
the
forecast
the
report
provides
further
indication
the
rapid
oil
demand
that
helped
opec
and
allies
get
rid
of
a
supply
glut
will
moderate
in
opec
last
month
said
global
growth
faced
numerous
challenges
although
its
latest
report
suggests
concern
about
them
has
deepened
rising
challenges
in
some
emerging
and
developing
economies
are
skewing
the
current
global
economic
growth
risk
forecast
to
the
downside
opec
said
in
the
report
rising
trade
tensions
and
the
consequences
of
further
potential
monetary
tightening
by
central
banks
in
combination
with
rising
global
debt
levels
are
additional
crude
briefly
pared
gains
after
the
opec
report
was
released
but
later
rallied
to
trade
above
a
barrel
a
level
reached
earlier
this
year
for
the
first
time
since
supported
by
expectations
for
a
further
drop
in
iranian
exports
opec
and
a
group
of
countries
agreed
on
june
to
return
to
percent
compliance
with
oil
output
cuts
that
began
in
january
after
months
of
underproduction
by
venezuela
and
others
pushed
adherence
above
percent
the
economic
downside
risks
will
provide
a
talking
point
for
a
group
of
opec
and
energy
ministers
meeting
on
in
algiers
to
monitor
the
market
the
meeting
could
make
policy
recommendations
opec
s
next
meeting
to
set
policy
is
not
until
december
in
the
report
opec
said
its
oil
output
rose
in
august
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
following
the
june
deal
the
biggest
rise
came
from
libya
which
is
exempt
from
the
agreement
this
helped
offset
declines
in
venezuela
where
production
is
declining
due
to
the
economic
crisis
and
iran
as
buyers
walked
away
ahead
of
the
sanctions
this
means
compliance
with
the
original
deal
has
increased
to
percent
according
to
a
reuters
calculation
meaning
members
are
still
cutting
more
than
promised
the
original
figure
for
july
was
percent
the
august
production
rate
is
lower
than
the
average
demand
for
opec
crude
in
and
considerably
more
than
will
be
needed
next
year
as
rivals
such
as
the
united
states
expand
supplies
opec
said
the
world
will
need
million
bpd
from
its
members
in
unchanged
from
last
month
this
suggests
there
will
be
a
bpd
surplus
in
the
market
should
opec
keep
pumping
the
same
amount
and
other
things
remain
equal
the
higher
prices
that
have
followed
the
deal
are
still
prompting
more
growth
in
rival
supply
opec
said
it
expects
production
to
expand
by
million
bpd
next
year
bpd
more
than
forecast
last
month
