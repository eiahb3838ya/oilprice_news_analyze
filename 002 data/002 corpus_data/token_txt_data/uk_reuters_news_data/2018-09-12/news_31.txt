saying
on

casting
doubts
on
a
push
for

turmoil
and

splintered
following
the

and
since
has
been
divided
between
competing
political
and
military
groups
based
in
tripoli
and
the
east
you
can
not
vote
with
instability
in
the
streets
it
is
necessary
that
everyone
accepts
the
result
of
the
ballot
we
need
shared
rules
seraj
who
leads
the
transitional
government
based
in
tripoli
said
in
an
interview
with
italian
daily
corriere
della

armed
groups
have
vowed
to
resume
hostilities
if
talks
to
be
hosted
by
special
envoy
ghassan
salame
do
not
result
in
a
lasting
settlement
seraj
has
close
relations
with
italy
his
main
rival
military
commander
khalifa
haftar
is
aligned
with
a
government
based
in
the
east
and
is
seen
as
closer
to
france
seraj
also
said
factions
would
need
to
agree
on
a
constitution
before
any
vote
is
held
we
had
talked
about
elections
in
paris

the
constitutional
document

is
ready
but
not
approved
must
first
be
voted
on
seraj
said
unfortunately
the
parliament
of
tobruk
has
not
yet
examined
it
without
the
constitution
how
can
one
go
to
a
national
vote
