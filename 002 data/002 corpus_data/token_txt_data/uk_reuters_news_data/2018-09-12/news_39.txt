the
united
states
is
on
course
to
meet
its
targets

states
are
taking
on
the
climate
change
fight
abandoned
by
president
donald
trump
according
to
report
released
on
wednesday
the

highlight
a
desire
among
large
swathes
of
the

continue
fighting
the
threat
of
climate
change
despite
the
government
s
disengagement
from
the
global
paris
agreement
to
curb
global
warming
the
trump
administration
may
have
dropped
the
ball
on
climate
action
said
daniel
firger
a
spokesman
for
bloomberg
philanthropies
which
commissioned
the
report
but
the

thousands
of
cities
states
and
businesses
are
picking
it
up
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
report
projected
that
emissions
would
drop
to
percent
below
levels
by
if
more

leaders
from
states
cities
and
businesses
fulfill
pledges
they
have
made
over

providing
options
for
americans

honoring
the
