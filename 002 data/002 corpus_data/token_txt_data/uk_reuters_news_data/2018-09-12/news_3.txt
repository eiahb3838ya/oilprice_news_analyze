commodities giant adm ramps up ethanol sales in chicago, irking rivals
new
sept
reuters
archer
daniels
midland
co
has
sold
unusually
high
volumes
of
ethanol
into
the
chicago
market
since
late
last
year
as
export
markets
dried
up
driving
down
prices
in
the
midwest
and
angering
the
company
s
rivals
according
to
traders
and
regulatory
data
the
global
commodities
powerhouse
a
major
ethanol
producer
accounted
for
roughly
percent
of
the
million
barrels
sold
at
the
chicago
hub
between
november
and
august
according
to
the
data
reviewed
by
reuters
previously
adm
had
been
a
regular
buyer
in
september
and
october
of
last
year
for
example
adm
bought
barrels
percent
of
the
million
total
trades
in
the
chicago
hub
during
that
stretch
according
to
the
data
adm
s
shift
came
amid
an
upheaval
in
the
domestic
ethanol
market
as
demand
flatlined
and
export
markets
including
china
and
brazil
were
cut
off
due
in
part
to
the
effects
of
president
donald
trump
s
widening
trade
disputes
with
growth
in
export
markets
slowing
ethanol
inventories
swelled
to
a
record
ethanol
traders
say
adm
is
saturating
the
domestic
market
anchoring
prices
and
bleeding
out
smaller
producers
less
equipped
to
manage
through
the
tough
times
adm
spokeswoman
jackie
anderson
when
asked
about
the
shift
in
the
company
s
strategy
said
adm
does
not
comment
on
the
specifics
of
its
commercial
activity
ethanol
futures
prices
traded
on
the
chicago
board
of
trade
late
last
month
fell
to
per
gallon
lowest
in
over
a
decade
ethanol
in
chicago
cash
markets
meanwhile
were
about
per
gallon
just
above
a
low
of
from
december
traders
told
reuters
the
heavy
selling
by
adm
has
led
traders
who
have
lost
money
on
the
slumping
ethanol
market
to
complain
to
s
p
global
platts
which
provides
benchmark
pricing
for
the
physical
ethanol
contract
at
different
delivery
points
including
chicago
in
july
platts
hosted
an
ethanol
pricing
methodology
workshop
in
houston
at
which
senior
traders
from
the
largest
ethanol
trading
shops
expressed
anger
about
adm
s
influence
on
the
market
according
to
several
traders
who
attended
it
s
one
person
s
view
of
the
market
said
one
trader
who
attended
the
meeting
traders
are
angry
and
they
blame
adm
another
trader
said
platts
said
the
company
is
conducting
ongoing
discussions
about
evolving
its
pricing
methodology
including
feedback
from
the
july
conference
we
are
still
evaluating
the
feedback
and
continuing
bilateral
conversations
with
market
participants
who
were
not
able
to
attend
the
company
said
in
a
written
statement
adm
can
produce
roughly
billion
gallons
of
ethanol
annually
about
percent
of
capacity
despite
its
massive
production
it
has
often
been
a
buyer
on
the
cash
market
to
supplement
its
supply
deals
or
to
support
a
market
view
dealers
said
the
company
has
told
investors
that
a
sustained
trade
war
with
china
could
hurt
sales
china
considered
the
top
growth
market
for
ethanol
exports
imposed
tariffs
of
about
percent
on
imports
of
american
biofuel
all
but
halting
shipments
there
the
commodity
giant
has
also
been
using
the
futures
market
to
show
that
it
could
deliver
additional
volumes
in
and
around
the
chicago
hub
the
company
can
easily
ship
to
chicago
from
its
large
ethanol
plants
in
iowa
on
the
chicago
board
of
trade
adm
registered
all
ethanol
contracts
for
delivery
as
of
tuesday
each
contract
representing
gallons
or
enough
for
about
one
rail
tanker
car
the
most
in
the
history
of
the
contract
according
to
cme
group
data
the
registrations
were
a
signal
to
the
over
other
companies
also
registered
to
participate
in
cbot
ethanol
deliveries
which
include
shell
green
plains
inc
vitol
and
mercuria
that
adm
has
an
abundant
supply
of
biofuel
in
storage
to
tap
and
sell
against
the
futures
contract
we
don
t
really
know
or
understand
what
they
are
doing
said
one
ceo
of
a
ethanol
company
one
trader
noted
that
adm
was
short
barrels
last
week
on
the
chicago
board
of
trade
as
a
major
ethanol
producer
they
are
long
physical
gallons
so
having
a
short
position
in
futures
as
a
hedge
against
physical
price
declines
is
not
unusual
