update 2-airlines lag climate goals despite fuel efficiency improvement -study

airline
fuel
efficiency
on
transatlantic
flights
has
improved
by
one
percent
a
year
since
as
carriers
modernized
their
fleets
but
the
industry
still
lags
its
own
climate
goals
according
to
a
study
released
on
wednesday
by
the
international
council
on
clean
transportation
but
the
study
s
findings
were
challenged
later
wednesday
by
an
aviation
industry
group
which
argued
that
carriers
are
actually
ahead
of
their
targets
according
to
the
icct
study
the
industry
s
average
fuel
efficiency
as
measured
by
how
much
fuel
is
used
to
transport
passengers
improved
to
passenger
kilometers
per
litre
of
fuel
from
between
and
as
carriers
opted
for
modern
aircraft
with
lower
fuel
burn
and
operated
fuller
planes
airlines
have
been
switching
to
more
planes
to
mitigate
the
impact
of
high
oil
prices
on
their
margins
the
aviation
industry
has
also
set
a
goal
of
capping
emissions
from
international
flights
at
levels
despite
rising
passenger
traffic
as
demand
for
global
travel
climbs
haldane
dodd
spokesman
for
the
air
transport
action
group
atag
which
counts
airlines
among
its
members
said
the
industry
is
achieving
a
percent
rolling
average
fleet
fuel
efficiency
improvement
for
all
flights
that
figure
is
ahead
of
a
goal
of
percent
efficiency
improvements
per
year
dodd
said
by
email
rankings
of
airline
efficiency
based
on
assumptions
and
modelled
estimates
are
not
a
useful
tool
for
either
the
public
or
policymakers
as
they
present
an
inaccurate
picture
of
the
operation
dodd
said
the
icct
compared
the
fuel
efficiency
of
nonstop
passenger
flights
between
north
america
and
europe
by
major
airlines
while
the
study
only
examined
transatlantic
flights
the
authors
argued
the
results
showed
industry
lagged
its
goals
flights
to
and
from
european
states
are
expected
to
account
for
percent
of
all
carbon
emissions
from
global
aviation
in
the
icct
said
citing
data
from
the
international
civil
aviation
organization
icao
new
policies
to
accelerate
investments
in
more
aircraft
and
operations
are
critical
if
industry
is
to
meet
its
climate
goals
said
dan
rutherford
aviation
program
director
for
the
icct
a
independent
research
organization
according
to
the
study
budget
carrier
norwegian
air
shuttle
asa
was
ranked
first
of
transatlantic
carriers
for
fuel
efficiency
while
british
airways
part
of
the
international
airlines
group
came
in
last
british
airways
on
wednesday
said
its
fuel
efficiency
per
passenger
appears
lower
because
on
such
routes
the
carrier
has
a
greater
share
of
the
premium
market
which
has
fewer
seats
