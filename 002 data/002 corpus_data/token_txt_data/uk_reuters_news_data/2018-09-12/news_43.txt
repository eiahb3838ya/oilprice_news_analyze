airline
fuel
efficiency
on
transatlantic
flights
has
improved
by
one
percent
a
year
since
as
carriers
buy
modern
planes
but
the
industry
still
lags
its
own
climate
goals
a
study
released
on
wednesday
said
the
industry
s
average
fuel
efficiency
improved
to
passenger
kilometers
per
liter
of
fuel
from
between
and
as
carriers
opted
for
modern
aircraft
with
lower
fuel
burn
and
operated
fuller
planes
the
study
from
the
international
council
on
clean
transportation
icct
said
airlines
have
been
switching
to
more
aircraft
in
an
attempt
to
mitigate
the
impact
of
high
oil
prices
on
their
margins
the
aviation
industry
has
also
set
a
goal
of
capping
emissions
from
international
flights
at
levels
despite
rising
passenger
traffic
as
global
travel
demand
climbs
in
the
international
civil
aviation
organization
icct
set
a
goal
of
percent
annual
fuel
efficiency
improvement
through
for
all
international
flights
airline
trade
group
international
air
transport
association
iata
expects
an
average
improvement
in
fuel
efficiency
of
percent
per
year
on
all
international
flights
from
to
while
the
study
only
looked
at
transatlantic
flights
the
icct
said
airlines
will
have
to
become
more
efficient
to
meet
industry
goals
new
policies
to
accelerate
investments
in
more
aircraft
and
operations
are
critical
if
industry
is
to
meet
its
climate
goals
said

aviation
program
director
for
the
independent
research
organization
the
study
compared
the
fuel
efficiency
of
nonstop
passenger
flights
between
north
america
and
europe
by
major
airlines
following
a
similar
study
conducted
in
starting
most
airlines
flying
international
routes
will
begin
monitoring
their
fuel
and
carbon
emissions
as
part
of
a
landmark
agreement
brokered
two
years
ago
by
icao
according
to
industry
figures
air
transport
accounts
for
percent

shuttle
asa

was
ranked
first
of
the
transatlantic
carriers
for
fuel
efficiency
while
british

part

group
came
in
