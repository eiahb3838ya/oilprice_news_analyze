fresh
sparring
between
washington
and
beijing
over
trade
kept
up
pressure
on
world
markets
on
wednesday
with
equities
struggling
and
emerging
currencies
mostly
weaker
led
by
the
indian
rupee
hitting
a
record
low
a
bruising
session
in
asia
took
msci
s
main
index
to
a
straight
day
in
the
red
its
longest
losing
streak
since
september
bourses
in
shanghai
hong
kong
and
tokyo
all
closed
lower
taking
emerging
equities
to
a
new
low
msci
s
equity
index
inched
up
marginally
looking
to
extend
two
sessions
of
modest
gains
that
had
snapped
six
straight
days
of
losses
what
the
market
needs
is
a
signal
of
some
relaxation
in
trade
rhetoric
a
bit
of
climbdown
said
salman
ahmed
chief
investment
strategist
at
lombard
odier
that
should
be
enough
as
economic
fundamentals
are
strong
but
you
do
need
a
trigger
point
and
so
far
we
have
not
seen
the
escalation
in
tensions
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
shows
no
sign
of
letting
up
president
donald
trump
said
on
tuesday
the
united
states
was
taking
a
tough
stance
with
china
that
cemented
expectations
that
new
levies
on
chinese
exports
will
soon
be
announced
earlier
china
told
the
world
trade
organization
wto
it
wanted
to
impose
billion
a
year
in
sanctions
on
the
united
states
in
retaliation
for
with
a
ruling
in
an
earlier
trade
dispute
equity
markets
also
faced
pressure
from
bond
yields
which
touched
a
decade
peak
on
tuesday
partly
spurred
by
data
that
provided
yet
more
evidence
of
the
economy
s
strength
that
data
had
pushed
wall
street
to
a
strong
close
led
by
tech
and
energy
shares
and
futures
for
the
nasdaq
benchmark
were
up
percent
on
wednesday
the
s
and
dow
jones
indexes
looked
set
for
flat
openings
however
in
europe
a
index
rose
percent
off
recent
lows
though
it
gave
up
earlier
strong
gains
ahmed
said
another
positive
catalyst
for
markets
could
be
signals
from
the
federal
reserve
that
it
could
slow
the
pace
of
interest
rate
rises
but
given
the
torrent
of
strong
data
that
looks
unlikely
data
this
week
showed
small
business
optimism
at
the
highest
level
on
record
in
when
emerging
markets
got
into
a
lot
of
trouble
the
fed
recognised
the
international
spillover
effect
this
time
that
has
not
happened
he
added
the
trade
rows
and
higher
interest
rates
have
pushed
an
index
of
emerging
currencies
almost
percent
lower
this
year
the
yuan
touched
week
lows
against
the
dollar
leading
asian
peers
lower
and
keeping
the
australian
dollar
heavily
linked
to
chinese
trade
close
to
its
lowest
since
february
the
dollar
inched
down
against
a
basket
of
currencies
as
hopes
grew
of
concessions
by
canada
that
would
resolve
disputes
over
reworking
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
but
emerging
currencies
stayed
under
pressure
while
the
turkish
lira
and
argentine
peso
have
steadied
off
record
lows
the
indian
rupee
is
continuing
to
plumb
new
troughs
taking
losses
versus
the
dollar
to
more
than
percent
the
rupee
is
symptomatic
of
the
overall
situation
in
emerging
markets
but
it
also
embeds
some
idiosyncratic
problems
with
the
fiscal
deficit
growing
and
the
current
account
deficit
widening
on
the
back
of
rising
commodity
prices

an
eye
on

just
off
the
highs
hit
on
tuesday
after
data
showing
sustained
strength
in
the
jobs
market
and
the
treasury
started
a
record
debt
sale
amounting
to
almost
billion
political

meanwhile
returned
to
the
radar
of
investors
in
italy
and
britain
italian
bond
yields
which
fell
to
lows
in
recent
days
rose
after
local

one

the

the
ruling

was
demanding
billion
euros
in
the

to
implement
plans

the

also
slipped
off
