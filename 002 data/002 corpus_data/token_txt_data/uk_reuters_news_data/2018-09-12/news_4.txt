libya
s
state
oil
firm
noc
said
on
wednesday
that
it
continued
to
manage
its
operations
normally
throughout
the
country
without
loss
of
production
after
a
shooting
attack
on
its
tripoli
headquarters
the
attack
on
monday
claimed
by
islamic
state
militants
killed
two
people
and
wounded
noc
provides
the
vast
bulk
of
the
libyan
state
s
income
and
along
with
the
central
bank
is
one
of
the
only
state
enterprises
still
functioning
well
after
years
of
armed
factional
conflict
the
national
oil
corporation
has
assured
all
citizens
that
it
has
implemented
contingency
plans
to
deal
with
the
crisis
to
ensure
that
its
production
and
daily
operations
continue
on
a
regular
basis
noc
said
in
a
statement
this
attack
did
not
cause
a
loss
of
production
noc
chairman
mustafa
sonallah
said
in
the
statement
which
did
not
reveal
noc
s
current
production
level
however
it
led
to
the
shedding
of
libyan
blood
sonallah
said
adding
that
the
attack
is
indicative
of
the
weakness
and
fragility
of
the
security
arrangements
in
the
country
he
also
said
the
current
security
vacuum
allows
terrorist
organisations
to
be
present
inside
the
country
libya
has
been
divided
between
rival
governments
and
military
factions
based
in
the
east
and
west
of
the
country
since
causing
political
deadlock
and
an
economic
crisis
however
the
noc
has
continued
to
function
relatively
normally
across
libya
which
relies
on
oil
exports
for
most
of
its
income
oil
output
has
been
hit
by
attacks
on
oil
facilities
and
blockades
though
last
year
it
partially
recovered
to
around
one
million
barrels
per
day
islamist
militants
have
sleeper
cells
in
northern
cities
as
well
as
mobile
units
in
libya
s
southern
desert
according
to
libyan
and
western
officials
