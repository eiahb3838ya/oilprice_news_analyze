maersk to invest in exhaust scrubbers ahead of 2020 fuel quality changes
reuters
the
world
s
biggest
container
shipping
group
will
add
devices
to
reduce
harmful
exhaust
emissions
to
some
of
its
ships
ahead
of
new
global
fuel
regulations
starting
in
to
combat
air
pollution
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
the
united
nations
shipping
agency
has
set
global
regulations
to
cap
the
sulphur
content
in
marine
fuels
known
as
bunkers
at
percent
down
from
percent
now
shipowners
could
meet
the
new
regulations
by
installing
exhaust
cleaning
systems
known
as
scrubbers
and
continue
to
burn
cheaper
fuel
oil
hsfo
the
companies
could
also
comply
by
burning
costlier
fuels
such
as
marine
gasoil
fuel
oil
or
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
as
part
of
the
preparations
we
have
decided
to
invest
in
new
scrubber
technology
on
a
limited
number
of
vessels
in
our
fleet
of
around
container
vessels
lindegaard
head
of
maersk
oil
trading
told
reuters
in
an
email
using
scrubber
technology
is
a
small
part
of
and
just
one
of
several
elements
in
our
overall
fuel
sourcing
strategy
to
ensure
compliance
in
time
he
said
a
spate
of
recent
scrubber
installation
orders
led
energy
researchers
to
revise
their
demand
forecasts
for
bunker
fuel
higher
as
the
scrubbers
will
let
the
ships
continue
to
burn
hsfo
but
a
switch
to
fuels
is
still
widely
seen
as
the
most
practical
form
of
compliance
given
the
high
investment
and
operational
costs
associated
with
scrubbers
and
uncertainty
around
future
emissions
regulations
while
we
will
continue
to
explore
how
to
best
comply
with
the
sulphur
cap
we
still
believe
the
best
solution
remains
with
compliant
fuels
from
refineries
on
land
said
lindegaard
in
august
maersk
announced
it
had
reached
an
agreement
with
royal
vopak
an
independent
tank
storage
operator
to
launch
a
percent
sulphur
fuel
bunkering
facility
in
rotterdam
the
joint
initiative
with
vopak
will
meet
about
percent
of
maersk
s
global
demand
for
imo
compliant
fuels
and
we
are
looking
into
more
bunkering
facilities
like
this
said
lindegaard
maersk
oil
trading
purchases
marine
fuel
for
its
parent
company
and
is
among
the
biggest
bunker
buyers
in
the
world
