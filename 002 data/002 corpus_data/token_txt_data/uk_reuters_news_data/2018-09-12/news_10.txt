the

what
the

needs
is
a
signal
of
some
relaxation
in

a

said
salman

chief

strategist
at

odier
that
should
be

as
economic
fundamentals
are
strong

you
do

point
and
so

not

that

ahmed
said
another
positive
catalyst
for
markets
could
be
signals
from

that
it
could
slow
the
pace
of
interest
rate
rises
but
given
the
torrent
of

data
that
looks
unlikely
data

showed
small

also
