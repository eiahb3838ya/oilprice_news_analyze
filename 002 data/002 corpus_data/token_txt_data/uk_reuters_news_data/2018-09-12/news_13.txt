vw
faced
over
its
use
of
illegal
software
to
cheat
emissions
tests
disclosed
in
september
the
start
of
proceedings
in
stuttgart
comes
two
days
after
a
separate
investor
suit
launched
in
the
northern
german
city
of
braunschweig
in
which
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
billions
of
euros
in
damages
from
vw
itself
as
well
as
from

to
cheating

emissions
tests
but
denies
it
failed
to
inform
investors
in
a
timely
fashion
bosch
supplied
key
parts
for
vw
s
diesel
engines
but
says
the
integration
of
them
was
the
responsibility
of
the
manufacturer
had
investors
known
about
vw
s
unlawful
activities
in
rigging
emissions
tests
they
may
have
sold
shares
earlier
or
not
made
purchases
thereby
avoiding
losses
on
their
holdings
the
plaintiffs
argue
vw
shares
lost
up
to
percent
of
their
value
in
the
days
after
authorities
exposed
illegal
levels
of
pollution
emitted
from
vw
diesel
cars
a
higher
court
in

is
due
to
rule
on
whether
the
suit
against
porsche

be
suspended

await
the
outcome
of
the
braunschweig
trial

the
two
cases
are
similar
porsche

the

voting
rights
in
vw
it
is
being
sued
by
investors
for
a
total
of
million
euros
billion
in
the
two
courts
porsche
se
sees
all
of
the
suits
as
unfounded
and
in
some
cases
without
legal
basis
like
vw
s
management
board
the
board
of
porsche
se
had
no
knowledge
of
any
cheating
on
diesel
emissions
tests
