kinder
morgan
inc
will
expand
loading
capacity
at
its
ethanol
terminal
in
chicago
to
address
producer
concerns
that
trade
at
the
terminal
a
benchmark
for
global
ethanol
prices
is
vulnerable
to
manipulation
three
people
briefed
on
the
company
s
plans
told
reuters
tens
of
thousands
of
barrels
change
hand
at
the
hub
every
day
but
many
more
barrels
across
the
country
depend
on
the
price
ethanol
trade
in
the
cash
market
at
the
kinder
morgan
argo
hub
is
used
in
contracts
for
the
biofuel
across
the
country
and
is
also
baked
into
international
contracts
trade
at
the
terminal
has
come
under
scrutiny
after
one
of
the
world
s
largest
commodities
merchants
archer
daniels
midland
co
switched
from
its
typical
role
as
a
buyer
in
late
to
a
big
seller
flooding
the
pricing
hub
with
ethanol
and
helping
drive
the
price
to
near
record
lows
farmers
are
struggling
with
a
loss
of
export
markets
due
to
the
trade
war
with
china
and
mixed
signals
from
the
trump
administration
on
its
support
of
the
nation
s
biofuel
laws
plants
have
idled
or
shut
altogether
in
recent
months
as
ethanol
prices
have
dropped
below
a
gallon
the
lowest
in
about
years
kinder
morgan
told
traders
at
an
industry
conference
in
orlando
florida
last
week
that
it
plans
to
at
least
double
the
amount
of
ethanol
barges
that
can
load
and
unload
at
its
two
existing
argo
docks
and
it
is
exploring
allowing
a
third
petrochemical
dock
to
also
move
ethanol
three
sources
briefed
on
the
meetings
told
reuters
kinder
will
also
build
a
new
storage
tank
at
its
stony
island
facility
near
argo
the
sources
said
the
stony
island
location
loads
and
unloads
ethanol
trains
the
additions
could
be
ready
before
the
end
of
the
year
traders
said
kinder
morgan
spokeswoman
lexey
long
said
the
company
declined
to
comment
for
the
story
the
increased
takeaway
capacity
will
make
it
more
difficult
to
drive
up
inventories
at
the
million
barrel
storage
hub
and
drive
down
price
traders
said
if
you
can
send
barrels
in
faster
than
you
can
take
out
then
you
can
drive
down
the
price
faster
and
for
a
longer
period
this
will
help
equalize
that
and
level
the
playing
field
said
one
ethanol
trader
currently
argo
can
unload
roughly
to
tank
cars
of
ethanol
each
week
or
roughly
million
gallons
and
can
load
two
barges
or
roughly
million
gallons
at
a
time
train
flows
into
the
terminal
fairly
smoothly
as
tank
cars
can
wait
outside
of
chicago
before
unloading
but
bottlenecks
at
the
docks
have
significantly
delayed
trade
at
times
traders
said
in
the
past
kinder
morgan
has
proposed
expanding
capacity
but
wanted
producers
and
trading
houses
to
help
fund
it
through
contracts
not
this
time
traders
said
i
think
they
know
people
are
upset
and
they
want
to
make
sure
they
retain
their
customer
base
said
another
trader
adm
s
heavy
selling
prompted
top
ethanol
producer
poet
llc
to
ask
the
cme
group
inc
to
change
the
way
it
prices
a
key
swap
contract
that
is
settled
based
on
the
cash
market
at
argo
poet
argued
that
the
connection
to
argo
made
the
swap
contracts
prone
to
manipulation
as
well
as
the
cash
market
adm
declined
to
comment
on
its
commercial
activity
but
said
in
a
statement
its
ethanol
trading
practices
are
proper
and
compliant
with
all
laws
and
the
rival
ice
exchange
is
contemplating
offering
an
alternative
to
cme
s
product
after
discussions
with
frustrated
biofuels
companies
reuters
previously
reported
argus
media
met
with
a
number
of
traders
earlier
this
month
in
houston
to
gauge
interest
in
establishing
a
new
cash
benchmark
that
would
rival
the
existing
one
set
by
s
p
global
platts
sources
tell
reuters
adm
can
produce
roughly
billion
gallons
of
ethanol
annually
about
percent
of
capacity
despite
its
massive
production
it
has
often
been
a
buyer
on
the
cash
market
to
supplement
its
supply
deals
or
to
support
a
market
view
dealers
said
the
global
commodities
powerhouse
a
major
ethanol
producer
accounted
for
roughly
percent
of
the
million
barrels
sold
at
the
chicago
hub
between
november
and
august
of
last
year
according
to
the
data
reviewed
by
reuters
late
last
year
the
number
went
above
percent
of
the
sales
reuters
reported
previously
adm
had
been
a
regular
buyer
in
september
and
october
of
for
example
adm
bought
barrels
percent
of
the
million
total
trades
in
the
chicago
hub
during
that
stretch
