gas
limits
epa
administrator
andrew
wheeler
and
nichols
met
two
weeks
ago
in
san
francisco
but
there
were
no
substantive
discussions
said
carb
spokesman
stanley
young
the
administration
broke
off
communications
before
christmas
and
never
responded
to
our
suggested
areas
of
compromise
or
offered
any
compromise
proposal
at
all
we
concluded
at
that
point
that
they
were
never
serious
about
negotiating

familiar
with
those
discussions
said

a

than
requiring
that
they
improve
