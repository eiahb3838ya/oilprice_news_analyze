investigators
have
identified
perpetrators
of
pervasive
rape
and
killings
and
torture
in
secret
safe
houses
in
south
sudan
and
believe
oil
revenues
have
driven
much
of
the
violence
in
its
civil
war
a
report
said
on
wednesday
the
commission
on
human
rights
in
south
sudan
recommended
further
investigation
of
evidence
that
proceeds
from
south
sudan
s
economy
had
been
channeled
to
government
forces
and
militias
linked
to
reported
war
crimes
the
commission
said
the
army
national
security
military
intelligence
rebel
forces
and
affiliated
armed
groups
had
committed
serious
human
rights
breaches
and
it
had
drawn
up
a
confidential
list
of
suspects
including
army
and
opposition
commanders
two
state
governors
and
a
county
commissioner
its
report
detailed
people
being
held
for
years
and
tortured
in
secret
detention
centers
children
being
run
down
by
tanks
rape
of
girls
as
young
as
seven
and
babies
being
drowned
starved
or
smashed
against
trees
in
some
stricken
areas
percent
of
females
and
percent
of
males
may
have
been
sexually
abused
according
to
the
report
although
south
sudan
s
main
warring
parties
signed
a
peace
deal
in
september
widespread
violence
especially
rape
has
continued
a
member
of
the
commission
andrew
clapham
said
it
was
outraged
by
reports
of
further
fighting
between
government
forces
and
the
rebel
national
salvation
front
which
was
not
part
of
the
peace
agreement
in
the
yei
river
area
there
are
thousands
of
civilians
who
have
been
forcibly
displaced
following
a
policy
in
which
the
parties
to
the
conflict
are
attacking
the
villages
torching
the
homes
killing
civilians
and
raping
women
and
girls
clapham
said
the
united
states
britain
and
norway
jointly
expressed
their
alarm
at
the
reports
of
escalating
violence
in
yei
these
military
actions
and
the
trading
of
blame
must
stop
they
said
in
a
joint
statement
clapham
said
that
more
than
refugees
had
reached
neighboring
democratic
republic
of
congo
and
up
to
people
were
expected
to
be
displaced
by
the
latest
fighting
the
report
cited
a
close
connection
between
oil
and
the
conflict
a
law
ensuring
that
south
sudan
s
regions
and
communities
received
two
and
three
percent
of
its
oil
revenue
respectively
had
triggered
a
redrawing
of
provincial
boundaries
and
ethnic
conflict
we
feel
the
national
security
services
are
very
much
involved
in
the
siphoning
off
of
oil
money
said
clapham
the
human
rights
council
should
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
sums
involved
and
where
the
money
was
going
he
told
reporters
noting
that
health
and
education
spending
was
minuscule
if
you
are
involved
in
oil
extraction
in
that
area
and
you
are
asked
to
assist
one
side
or
the
other
you
could
be
accused
of
complicity
in
war
crimes
there
are
council
members
that
we
think
have
a
responsibility
to
look
more
carefully
at
south
sudan
is
one
of
the
world
s
worst
humanitarian
crises
this
year
the
united
nations
needs
billion
for
aid
for
its
population
and
billion
for
its
refugees
