new
rules
on
wednesday
part
of
efforts
to
diversify
its
capital
markets
like
other
african
nations
kenya
needs
to
raise
billions
of
dollars
to
invest
in
infrastructure
projects
including
roads
water
and
irrigation
railways
and
power
generation
the
legal

geoffrey
odundo
chief
executive
officer
of
the
nairobi
securities
exchange
said
green
bonds
are
fixed
income
securities
that
raise
capital
to
help
finance
projects
in
renewable
energy
green
transport
and
wastewater
treatment
we
are
introducing
a
verifier
component
because
there
is
need
for
verification
of
green
assets
and
green
financing
it
s
what
makes
it
possible
for
issuance
of
green
bonds
odundo
said
adding
that
the
target
was
to
issue
one
in
to
provide
traction
for
other
issuers
the
government
of
kenya
have
come
up
strongly
that
they
are
looking
at
doing
a
green
bond
and
its
one
of
the
ones
we
are
keenly
talking
to

mugambi
director
of
public
affairs
at
the
kenya
bankers
association
said
that
there
are
two
strong
potential
issuers
from
the
banking
sector
with
one
at
an
advanced
stage
but
commercial
lending
rates
capped
in
september
at
percentage
points
above
the
central
bank
s
benchmark
rate
may
make
it
difficult
for
banks
to
price
the
products
the
rate
cap
is
making
it
difficult
for
banks
to
come
into
the
capital
markets
to
raise
capital
therefore
it
s
limiting
the
bonds
but
more
so
it
s
limiting
the
potential
that
we
see
within
the
green
bonds
space

first
green

in

ministry
officials
said
that
there
was
room
to
raise
funding
through
green
bonds
for
infrastructure
projects
with
an
initial
aim
of
about
