a
rescue
package
for
eskom
south
africa
s
most
important
state
firm
is
expected
to
dominate
finance
minister
tito
mboweni
s
budget
speech
on
wednesday
with
the
struggling
power
utility
at
risk
of
collapse
without
a
large
bailout
eskom
supplies
percent
of
south
africa
s
electricity
but
is
drowning
in
billion
rand
billion
of
debt
after
a
decade
of
financial
decline
marred
by
corruption
scandals
and
mismanagement
it
carried
out
some
of
the
worst
power
cuts
in
several
years
last
week
and
is
cited
by
ratings
agencies
as
the
biggest
risk
to
the
economy
as
it
no
longer
generates
enough
profit
to
meet
its
over
billion
rand
a
year
of
finance
costs
president
cyril
ramaphosa
pledged
to
split
eskom
into
three
entities
this
month
and
said
financial
support
measures
would
be
contained
in
mboweni
s
speech
in
december
eskom
s
chairman
asked
the
government
to
take
billion
rand
of
the
company
s
debt
onto
its
balance
sheet
but
ramaphosa
said
other
options
needed
to
be
considered
eskom
will
obviously
dominate
the
budget
and
we
remain
of
the
view
that
the
government
is
unlikely
to
agree
to
the
billion
rand
bailout
that
eskom
is
hoping
for
said
darias
jonker
director
for
africa
at
the
eurasia
group
consultancy
mboweni
s
room
for
manoeuvre
is
limited
by
a
large
fiscal
deficit
which
means
there
is
little
spare
cash
in
the
budget
he
is
also
at
pains
to
preserve
south
africa
s
last
investment
grade
credit
rating
from
moody
s
which
is
expected
to
review
the
rating
next
month
mboweni
s
options
include
the
state
agreeing
to
pay
some
or
all
of
eskom
s
costs
or
cash
injections
spread
over
a
period
of
several
years
the
money
could
come
from
tax
hikes
unspent
money
from
previous
budgets
which
the
finance
ministry
has
on
deposit
or
government
bond
issuance
analysts
have
cautiously
welcomed
ramaphosa
s
plan
to
split
eskom
as
a
sign
the
government
is
finally
addressing
the
firm
s
monopolistic
structure
but
they
want
to
see
evidence
that
officials
will
take
tough
decisions
like
trimming
its
bloated
workforce
