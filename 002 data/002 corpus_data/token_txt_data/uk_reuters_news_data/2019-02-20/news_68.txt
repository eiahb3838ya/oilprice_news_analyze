paris
feb
reuters
air
pledged
to
eke
out
efficiency
gains
to
offset
higher
fuel
costs
this
year
as
the
airline
group
deepens
cooperation
between
its
two
main
carriers
presenting
earnings
for
the
group
he
joined
in
september
chief
executive
ben
smith
promised
networks
and
fleets
after
overcoming
klm
resistance
to
closer
integration
with
air
france
in
a
boardroom
deal
struck
on
tuesday
these
first
achievements
pave
the
way
for
our
ambition
to
regain
a
leading
position
in
europe
and
worldwide
smith
said
in
a
company
statement
underlining
the
challenge
earnings
before
interest
tax
depreciation
and
amortisation
ebitda
fell
pct
to
million
euros
million
as
the
fuel
bill
mounted
despite
a
percent
revenue
gain
to
billion
blighted
by
restrictive
french
union
deals
and
strikes
that
last
year
wiped
million
euros
off
earnings
and
forced
out
its
previous
ceo
air
has
trailed
rivals
lufthansa
and
british
airways
on
profitability
but
smith
an
air
canada
veteran
has
restored
labour
peace
by
granting
wage
hikes
in
return
for
increased
flexibility
with
which
he
now
hopes
to
make
better
and
more
profitable
use
of
the
group
s
aircraft
and
networks
on
the
eve
of
its
results
presentation
air
struck
a
new
pay
deal
with
its
french
pilots
and
resolved
a
standoff
with
klm
and
the
dutch
division
s
popular
leader
pieter
elbers
over
smith
s
integration
plans
almost
years
after
the
merger
that
created
air
decisions
on
networks
fleets
and
commercial
strategy
will
be
taken
at
group
level
rather
than
by
the
individual
carriers
under
the
plans
unveiled
on
tuesday
which
also
see
elbers
and
his
air
france
counterpart
become
deputy
group
ceos
the
financials
were
broadly
in
line
with
expectations
of
million
euros
of
ebidta
on
billion
in
revenue
based
on
the
median
of
seven
analyst
estimates
in
a
poll
by
infront
data
the
fuel
bill
rose
by
million
euros
in
and
will
climb
another
million
this
year
as
hedges
expire
chief
financial
officer
frederic
gagey
told
reporters
overall
unit
costs
up
percent
last
year
before
currency
and
impacts
were
well
under
control
gagey
said
and
forward
bookings
for
the
summer
season
are
better
positioned
than
a
year
ago
passenger
traffic
rose
pct
to
million
in
the
last
quarter
the
group
said
while
unit
revenue
a
measure
of
proceeds
in
relation
to
capacity
fell
pct
the
transavia
arm
was
a
bright
spot
posting
a
percent
operating
margin
for
its
french
operations
as
it
prepares
to
expand
capacity
by
about
percent
in
the
rollout
of
new
digital
platforms
to
travel
agents
will
generate
savings
in
the
cfo
said
along
with
improvements
to
network
planning
and
the
gradual
replacement
of
airbus
and
boeing
planes
less
than
alternatives
the
newly
announced
management
changes
should
also
boost
efforts
to
increase
synergies
in
areas
such
as
purchasing
which
was
nominally
integrated
in
but
lacked
a
single
chief
procurement
officer
until
last
year
smith
s
new
centralisation
push
nonetheless
builds
on
years
of
painstaking
integration
that
has
already
assigned
some
workers
to
services
and
managers
said
gagey
who
joined
air
france
in
it
s
not
as
if
we
just
realised
we
should
begin
to
look
for
synergies
