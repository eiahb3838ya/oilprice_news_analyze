opec

told

saudi

said
he
hoped
the
oil
market
would
be
balanced
by
april
and
that
there
would
be
no
gap
in
supplies
due
to
sanctions
on
iran
and
venezuela
you
could
take
that
as
a
signal
that
saudi

will
continue
to
take
a
proactive
approach
said
andy
lipow
president
of
lipow
oil
associates
in

some
supply
disruptions
have
further
tightened
supplies
saudi
state
oil
firm
aramco
last

shut
part
of
its
safaniyah
offshore
oil
field
after
a
power
cable
was
inadvertently
cut
production
at
libya
s
contested
el
sharara
field
has
been
halted
since
december
sanctions
on
iran
and
venezuela
have
also
helped
to
reduce
the
availability
of
crude
on
the
global
market
however
price
gains
were
capped
as
those
supply
disruptions
were
offset
by
expectations
of
inventory
builds
in
the
united
states
following
a
sharp
reduction
in
refineries
capacity
utilization
in
the
midwest
crude
stockpiles
were
expected
to
have
risen
by
million
barrels
last

the
fifth
consecutive

build
an
extended

showed
inventories
at
cushing
oklahoma
the

refinery
