national
security
according
to
a

of
crude
oil
natural

and
coal
and
unwind
regulatory

currently
on
the

house
s
national
security
council
happer
disagrees
with
mainstream
climate
science
and
believes
that
emissions
of
the
main
greenhouse
gas
that
scientists
blame
for
climate
change
carbon
dioxide
benefits
the
planet
by
helping
plants
grow
the
document
calls
into
question
government
reports
that
say
climate
change
poses
risks
to
national
security
including
the
worldwide
threat
assessment
from
the
office
of
the
director
of
national
intelligence
dni
dan
coats
these
scientific
and
national
security
judgements
have
not
undergone
a
rigorous
independent
and
adversarial
scientific
peer
review
to
examine
the
certainties
and
uncertainties
of
climate
science
as
well
as
implications
for
national
security
the
document
said
the
annual
dni
report
issued
in
january
said
droughts
floods
wildfires
and
rising
seas
made
worse
by
climate
change
and
environmental
degradation
pose
global
threats
to
infrastructure
and
security
in
january
the
department
of
defence
said
climate
change
was
a
national
security
issue
and
listed
domestic
bases
at
risk
from
floods
drought
encroaching
deserts
wildfires
and
in
alaska
thawing
permafrost
officials
have
also
said
that
climate
change
can
burden
the
military
by
increasing
the
number
of
global
humanitarian
missions
in
which
it
participates
the
white
house
is
holding
a
meeting
on
in
the
situation
room
to
discuss
an
upcoming
executive
order
by
trump
to
set
up
the
committee
made
up
of
or
fewer
people
said
the
document
dated
the
document
was
first
reported
by
the
washington
post
trump
has
repeatedly
cast
doubt
on
the
science
of
climate
change
arguing
that
the
causes
and
impacts
are
not
yet
settled
as
a
temporary
blast
of
frigid
cold
hit
the
midwest
last
month

said

twitter
what
the
hell

please
come
back
fast
we
need
you
happer
who
does
not
have
a
background
in
climate
has
served
on
the
nsc
since
as
deputy
assistant
to
the
president
for
emerging
technologies
and
complained
that
carbon
dioxide
emissions
have
been
maligned
a
position
strongly
opposed
by
a
vast
majority
of
climate
scientists
happer
said
on
cnbc
in
that
the
demonization
of
carbon
dioxide
is
just
like
the
demonization
of
the
poor
jews
under
the
white
house
did
not
have
a
comment
on
the
document
francesco
femia
the
of
the
center
for
climate
security
a
research
and
policy
group
called
the
panel
a
sham
committee
that
could
put
a
chill
on
further
analysis
of
climate
risks
from
some
members
of
military
and
intelligence
agencies
i
am
worried
there
will
be
a
reticence
among
some
in
the
future
to
include
those
risks
in
their
public
reports
for
fear
of
having
to
deal
with
this
political
committee
in
the
white
house
because
ultimately
the
heads
of
departments
and
agencies
serve
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president
