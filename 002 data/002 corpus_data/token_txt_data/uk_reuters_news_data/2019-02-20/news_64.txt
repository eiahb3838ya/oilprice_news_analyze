india
s
demand
for
electricity
is
expected
to
double
in
the
next
two
decades
and
coal
has
been
long
forecast
to
be
the
fuel
of
choice
for
power
generation
but
this
may
no
longer
be
the
case
it
s
not
that
india
doesn
t
have
plentiful
reserves
of
coal
it
does
and
it
is
the
world
s
producer
and
importer
following
china
it
s
not
even
that
india
s
reserves
are
expensive
to
mine
they
aren
t
it
s
not
even
that
transporting
coal
from
where
it
s
mined
to
where
it
s
needed
is
too
difficult
yes
it
is
an
issue
but
this
challenge
could
be
overcome
with
sufficient
investment
in
rail
and
other
infrastructure
no
the
main
reason
coal
may
battle
to
fuel
india
s
future
energy
needs
is
that
it
s
simply
becoming
too
expensive
relative
to
renewable
energy
alternatives
such
as
wind
and
solar
in
recent
months
power
supply
auctions
have
shown
that
renewables
can
be
offered
at
less
than
rupees
cents
per
kilowatt
hour
a
tariff
that
generators
have
difficulty
matching
there
is
also
zero
chance
that
new
coal
generators
can
produce
electricity
at
rates
competitive
to
renewables
given
higher
capital
and
operating
costs
rajit

the
head
of
engineering
procurement
and
construction
at
major
private
generator
tata
power
told
a
forum
at
this
week
s
coaltrans
india
conference
that
his
company
wasn
t
looking
at
developing
any
new
coal
plants
tata
power
is
instead
focusing
on
buying
power
plants
that
are
effectively
distressed
assets
many
of
these
plants
started
construction
in
the
past
seven
years
when
power
demand
and
price
forecasts
for
electricity
were
bullish
some
of
the
plants
under
construction
or
newly
completed
though
have
been
unable
to
secure
power
purchase
agreements
with
high
enough
prices
for
them
to
operate
profitably
this
means
a
company
such
as
tata
power
can
buy
these
brownfield
plants
at
a
discount
steep
enough
to
make
them
viable
at
the
electricity
prices
currently
being
offered
the
coal
sector
s
struggles
are
starting
to
show
in
data
compiled
by
the
global
coal
plant
tracker
as
of
january
india
had
gigawatts
gw
of
coal
capacity
under
construction
and
gw
operating
according
to
the
data
the
data
also
shows
however
a
total
of
gw
of
planned
capacity
additions
were
cancelled
in
the
past
eight
years
a
fairly
dramatic
of
india
s
aspirations
the
government
s
national
electricity
plan
assumes
that
gw
of
new
capacity
will
be
added
between
the
and
the
fiscal
years
but
with
only
gw
currently
permitted
the
pipeline
of
new
plants
would
appear
to
be
considerably
lower
than
what
the
government
is
forecasting
a
further
issue
for
india
s
coal
sector
is
that
banks
are
becoming
reluctant
to
lend
to
new
ventures
and
insurers
are
also
becoming
less
keen
to
offer
cover
this
is
largely
because
the
risk
that
new
coal
plants
are
unviable
is
rising
with
gw
of
indian
coal
plants
currently
assessed
as
stranded
assets
according
to
research
published
by
the
institute
for
energy
economics
and
financial
analysis
thus
it
s
becoming
increasingly
likely
that
private
companies
in
india
will
not
build
any
new
power
plants
leaving
only
companies
like
major
generator
ntpc
as
potential
builders
ntpc
s
website
discloses
that
the
company
currently
plans
to
add
gw
of
new
capacity
by
by
itself
or
in
joint
ventures
with
the
majority
being
this
is
some
way
short
of
the
government
s
plans
it
s
also
possible
the
retirement
of
older
units
over
the
forecast
period
may
be
close
to
or
even
exceed
new
capacity
additions
if
coal
is
becoming
unattractive
in
india
the
question
then
is
whether
renewables
can
really
meet
the
expected
increase
in
demand
for
electricity
while
it
will
certainly
be
possible
to
install
sufficient
renewable
capacity
the
challenge
will
be
integrating
this
intermittent
power
source
onto
the
grid
and
also
installing
sufficient
storage
in
the
form
of
batteries
or
pumped
hydro
to
ensure
stability
coal
won
t
disappear
in
india
with
the
existing
fleet
likely
to
generate
power
for
at
least
two
more
decades
but
coal
s
share
of
generation
is
likely
to
slip
and
power
companies
will
have
to
do
more
to
prepare
for
the
increasingly
likelihood
that
renewable
energies
are
going
to
provide
most
of
the
new
capacity
in
coming
years
the
opinions
expressed
here
are
those
