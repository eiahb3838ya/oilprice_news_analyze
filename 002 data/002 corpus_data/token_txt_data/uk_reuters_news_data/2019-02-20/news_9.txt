inc
highlights
the
benefits
of
being
an
integrated
oil
company
and
could
revive
investor
interest
in
the
languishing
canadian
energy
sector
fund
managers
said
the
move
is
also
seen
by
some
as
a
wager
the
energy
sector
could
benefit
from
a
change
in
the
guard
in
canada
s
alberta
province
which
has
an
election
this
year
berkshire
s
new
percent
stake
in
suncor
valued
at
c
million
million
at
current
prices
is
already
worth
percent
more
since
berkshire
bought
it
in
the
last
quarter
it
comes
more
than
two
years
after
it
sold
for
million
a
percent
stake
it
had
bought
in
and
added
to
in
its
is
seen
by
analysts
as
a
validation
that
canada
s
biggest
oil
and
gas
company
has
catalysts
such
as
a
new
incoming
ceo
and
the
eventual
removal
of
alberta
oil
curtailments
that
could
propel
the
stock
higher
berkshire
has
not
publicly
discussed
its
reasons
for
its
recent
investment
in
suncor
and
did
not
comment
when
reached
by
reuters
while
a
bet
on
suncor
is
not
seen
as
a
play
on
the
entire
industry
major
berkshire
shareholder
warren
buffett
s
stature
as
a
value
investor
is
expected
to
prompt
other
funds
to
wade
back
into
the
canadian
energy
sector
people
always
pay
attention
when
warren
buffett
makes
a
play
and
i
don
t
think
it
will
be
any
different
this
time
around
said
mike
archibald
associate
portfolio
manager
at
agf
investments
it
s
a
great
signal
that
foreign
capital
is
starting
to
flow
back
to
canada
as
this
will
ultimately
be
the
main
driver
of
stock
investors
and
some
foreign
majors
have
shunned
canada
s
oil
patch
in
recent
years
due
to
high
production
costs
environmental
concerns
and
difficulties
moving
crude
due
to
clogged
pipelines
berkshire
has
largely
avoided
energy
stocks
with
the
exception
of
an
investment
in
exxon
mobil
corp
which
it
owned
for
more
than
a
year
before
selling
the
more
than
billion
stake
in
late
as
oil
prices
fell
suncor
however
is
positioned
to
weather
more
adverse
market
conditions
than
many
producers
because
it
owns
refineries
and
has
committed
pipeline
space
allowing
it
to
access
markets
berkshire
is
typically
a
countercyclical
value
investor
so
we
are
not
surprised
the
interest
was
renewed
in
a
name
like
suncor
said
cavan
yie
portfolio
manager
at
manulife
asset
management
which
manages
about
billion
in
assets
suncor
is
one
of
his
largest
positions
suncor
is
somewhat
insulated
from
these
risks
given
the
fact
that
they
have
a
strong
downstream
operation
which
financially
benefits
from
oil
bottlenecks
and
that
is
unique
to
suncor
which
you
can
t
get
with
many
other
companies
in
the
energy
suncor
shares
are
up
percent
giving
it
a
billion
market
value
compared
with
percent
for
the
toronto
stock
exchange
composite
index
buffett
has
found
an
attractive
entry
point
for
an
sector
and
a
good
company
that
is
industry
leading
said
brian
pow
vice
president
of
research
and
equity
analyst
at
acumen
capital
finance
partners
in
another
canadian
investment
buffett
bought
into
home
capital
in
when
the
canadian
alternative
mortgage
lender
was
under
pressure
and
made
a
big
profit
by
largely
exiting
the
position
late
last
year
some
investors
are
betting
that
a
change
in
government
in
alberta
after
a
spring
election
could
benefit
the
oil
industry
the
governing
new
democrats
have
taken
big
steps
to
help
the
industry
including
leasing
rail
cars
this
week
to
move
oil
but
badly
needed
pipelines
remain
stalled
due
to
opposition
from
environmentalists
while
a
new
governing
party
may
not
change
the
actual
end
outcomes
of
the
pipeline
discussion
it
may
provide
some
optimism
that
a
new
set
of
solutions
will
be
pursued
