oil
prices
hovered
near
highs
on
wednesday
supported
by
supply
cuts
and
sanctions
on
iran
and
venezuela
but
capped
by
soaring
production
and
expectations
of
an
economic
slowdown
west

crude
oil

were
at
per

at

down

from
their
last

but
not
far
off
their

of
reached
earlier
this

international

crude
futures
had
yet
to
trade
they
also
hit
a
high
of
per
barrel
this
week
prices
have
been
driven
up
by
supply
cuts
led
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
opec
s
and
the
world
s
biggest
oil
exporter
saudi
arabia
is
expected
to
reduce
shipments
of
light
crude
oil
to
asia
in
march
as
part
of
the
effort
to
tighten
markets
opec
as
well
as
some
producers
such
as
russia
agreed
late
last
year
to
cut
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
prevent
a
large
supply
overhang
from
swelling
we
have
lowered
saudi
crude
oil
output
in
line
with
announcements
and
are
now
assuming
that
saudi
arabia
will
produce
in
the
first
three
quarters
of
less
than
the
million
bpd
target
it
agreed
to
at
the
december
opec
meeting
french
bank
bnp
paribas
said
in
a
note
because
of
the
cuts
bnp
said
it
expected
oil
prices
to
rally
through
with
brent
to
average
per
barrel
by
then
and
wti
to
average
another
key
oil
price
driver
has
been
sanctions
on
oil
exporters
iran
and
venezuela
despite
the
sanctions
iran
s
crude
exports
were
higher
than
expected
in
january
averaging
around
million
bpd
according
to
refinitiv
ship
tracking
data
many
analysts
had
expected
iran
oil
exports
to
drop
below
million
bpd
after
the
imposition
of
sanctions
last
november
standing
against
the
supply
cuts
and
sanctions
is
crude
output
which
soared
by
more
than
million
bpd
in
to
a
record
million
bpd
thanks
to
booming
shale
oil
production
which
the
energy
information
administration
on
tuesday
said
was
expected
to
keep
rising
bnp
paribas
said
surging
output
would
feed
into
lower
oil
prices
towards
the
end
of
the
year
with
brent
to
dip
to
an
average
of
a
barrel
by
the
fourth
quarter
and
wti
to
average
oil
production
growth
driven
by
shale
will
be
increasingly
exported
in
greater
volumes
to
international
markets
while
the
global
economy
is
expected
to
witness
a
synchronised
slowdown
in
growth
