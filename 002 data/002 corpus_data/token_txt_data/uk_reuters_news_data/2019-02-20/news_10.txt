did
not
respond
to
requests
for

aot
declined
to
comment
the
terms
of
the
deal
are
secret
but
broadly
speaking
using
current
lng
prices
the
deal
would
be
worth
billion
this
would
be
aot
s
first
lng
contract
although
it
trades
lng
on
the
spot
market
and
has
contracts
its
pipeline
gas
and
lng

amounted
to
billion
cubic
metres
last

only
began
importing
it
last
year
industry
players
say
it
is
still
on
a
learning
curve
and
that
its
strategy
has
been
haphazard
at
times
one
government
official
conceded
the
nation
had
taken
on
too
many
projects
without
proper
planning
the
country
received

dwindling
the
nation
of
million
people
is
set
to
be
a
significant
player
in
the
global
lng
market
alongside
pakistan
and
india
however
it
has
tempered
its
initial
enthusiasm
officials
at
one
point
were
considering
a
dozen
import
projects
but
have
since
pared
the
list
down
and
shifted
focus
to
building
onshore
rather
than
floating
facilities
