peru
on
tuesday
launched
a
drive
to
eliminate
illegal
gold
mining
in
one
of
the
amazon
s
most
biodiverse
corners
sending
police
and
military
officers
to
a
region
that
has
suffered
rising
deforestation
from
wildcat
mining
president
martin
vizcarra
s
government
said
it
was
suspending
civil
liberties
and
tasking
the
military
with
restoring
law
in
madre
de
dios
a
rainforest
region
known
for
its
biodiversity
forests
and
indigenous
tribes
that
shun
contact
the
state
of
emergency
was
declared
for
two
months
and
troops
were
sent
to
the
area
for
six
months
the
operation
got
off
to
a
rough
start
with
two
police
officers
and
a
prosecutor
killed
when
a
bus
transporting
security
forces
flipped
over
the
interior
ministry
said
if
successful
the
effort
would
mark
the
first
time
peru
has
managed
to
stop
the
illegal
mining
which
releases
tonnes
of
mercury
into
the
environment
and
drives
sex
trafficking
and
child
labor
in
mining
camps
the
crackdown
might
also
impact
gold
shipments
from
peru
the
world
s
no
producer
as
some
illegal
ore
makes
its
way
into
the
legal
supply
chain
through
shell
companies
the
illegal
gold
rush
in
madre
de
dios
focused
on
extracting
gold
from
alluvial
deposits
in
river
beds
was
fueled
by
high
prices
for
the
metal
during
the
financial
crisis
it
s
been
growing
for
better
part
of
a
decade
said
luis
fernandez
a
wake
forest
university
ecologist
who
has
studied
the
issue
since
in
every
town
there
are
little
shops
that
buy
gold
from
previous
governments
that
have
sent
troops
to
destroy
illegal
mines
in
the
region
have
failed
to
stop
their
expansion
into
a
nature
reserve
wildcat
miners
in
madre
de
dios
are
often
tipped
off
about
government
plans
allowing
them
to
flee
before
regrouping
once
security
forces
leave
environmentalists
say
criminal
groups
in
the
region
are
now
more
organized
and
violent
in
deforestation
from
wildcat
mining
in
southern
peru
where
madre
de
dios
is
located
peaked
at
hectares
acres
according
to
a
report
by
monitoring
of
the
andean
amazon
project
maap
which
uses
satellite
images
to
track
deforestation
for
