beijing

china
s
capital
city
beijing
has
pledged
to
improve
air
quality
this
year
but
did
not
commit
to
a
specific
target
suggesting
the
country
s
campaign
is
stalling
as
the
easily
attainable
measures
have
already
been
taken
beijing
will
keep
improving
air
quality
with
average
annual
concentrations
of
small
particles
and
rolling
average
level
continuing
to
be
lowered
said
beijing
municipal
government
in
a
statement
on
wednesday
average
concentrations
of
or
particulate
matter
that
measures
microns
in
fell
percent
from
to
micrograms
per
cubic
meter
as
a
result
of
its
stringent
push
to
trim
coal
consumption
and
to
clear
out
polluting
plants
however
beijing
s
levels
were
still
much
higher
than
china
s
average
of
micrograms
per
cubic
meter
and
national
target
of
micrograms
per
cubic
meter
is
a
closely
monitored
air
pollutant
because
its
small
size
allows
the
particles
to
lodge
deep
in
the
lungs
the
world
health
organization
recommends
an
air
quality
standard
for
of
no
more
than
micrograms
per
cubic
meter
the
beijing
government
said
it
will
target
emissions
from
vehicles
the
biggest
source
in
the
city
construction
sites
and
manufacturing
plants
in
however
the
ministry
of
ecology
and
environment
mee
warned
in
a
news
briefing
last
month
that
emission
cuts
in
beijing
itself
will
be
not
enough
to
support
a
large
scale
of
cuts
the
ministry
reckons
beijing
will
also
need
to
reduce
external
impacts
from
other
regions
in
particular
from
the
hub
of
shanxi
and
shaanxi
provinces
in
a
word
beijing
s
target
this
year
is
to
maintain
current
achievements
public
should
be
prepared
to
see
a
rising
reading
if
there
is
adverse
weather
condition
liu
bingjiang
the
head
of
the
atmospheric
environment
department
at
the
mee
said
at
the
briefing
average
level
in
beijing
was
micrograms
per
cubic
meter
in
january
up
percent
from
a
year
ago
according
to
the
mee
data
the
city
also
aims
to
improve
its
water
quality
and
tackle
soil
pollution
in
by
improving
the
efficiency
of
fertilizer
usage
in
rural
area
and
tightening
disposal
standards

to
the
government
