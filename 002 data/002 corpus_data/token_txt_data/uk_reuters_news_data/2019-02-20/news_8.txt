eskom
with
billion

billion
over
three
years
the
centrepiece
of
a
budget
that
exposed
the
limited
room
president
cyril
ramaphosa
has
to
fix
the
economy
ahead
of
an
election
in
may
ramaphosa
who
is
fighting
rifts
within
his
own
party
before
the
parliamentary
election
has
made
reforming
eskom
one
of
his
top
priorities
as
its
billion
rand
debt
pile
poses
a
direct
threat
to
africa
s
most
developed
economy
analysts
said
the
financial
support
would
give
the
ailing
power
firm
several
years
to
implement
a
restructuring
plan
which
will
see
it
split
into
separate
entities
for
generation
transmission
and
distribution
but
it
still
leaves
eskom
which
last
week
subjected
south
africa
to
the
worst
series
of
power
cuts
in
several
years
facing
an
uncertain
future
with
unsustainable
debts
crippling
costs
and
stagnant
sales
the
money
for
eskom
is
insufficient
given
the
length
of
time
over
which
the
eskom
reorganisation
will
occur
and
the
practical
and
political
pitfalls
that
are
ahead
said
peter
attard
montalto
head
of
capital
markets
research
at
intellidex
those
pitfalls
include
major
job
cuts
an
option
that
was
unlikely
to
be
implemented
before
the
election
amid
fierce
opposition
from
leftist
sections
of
the
ruling
african
national
congress
anc
and
powerful
trade
unions
the
anc
is
expected
to
win
the
election
but
only
a
handsome
victory
would
give
ramaphosa
the
mandate
to
push
through
painful
reforms
that
are
opposed
by
those
within
the
governing
party
still
loyal
to
his
predecessor
jacob
zuma
in
his
maiden
budget
speech
finance
minister
tito
mboweni
told
parliament
the
emergency
funds
for
eskom
would
be
financed
through
reprioritised
spending
and
increased
borrowing
but
he
rejected
eskom
s
request
that
the
state
take
on
billion
rand
of
its
debt
pouring
money
directly
into
eskom
in
its
current
form
is
like
pouring
water
into
a
sieve
mboweni
said
i
want
to
make
it
clear
the
national
government
is
not
taking
on
eskom
s
he
raised
the
possibility
of
selling
off
more
than
parastatals
often
cited
as
a
risk
to
the
public
purse
isn
t
it
about
time
the
country
asks
the
question
do
we
still
need
these
enterprises
mboweni
asked
the
rand
and
benchmark
government
bond
initially
fell
as
the
budget
forecast
wider
deficits
rising
debt
and
slower
economic
growth
before
later
strengthening
as
it
became
clear
the
state
would
not
carry
eskom
s
debt
eskom
s
and
dollar
bonds
also
strengthened
but
rising
government
debt
levels
in
a
low
growth
environment
will
remain
a
concern
for
ratings
agencies
south

highlights
the

s
limited
fiscal
flexibility
the

shows
a
further
erosion
in
fiscal
strength
moody
s
the
last
of
the
top
three
agencies
to
have
south
africa
at
investment
grade
said
of
the
budget
moody
s
is
due
to
announce
a
ratings
decision
at
the
end
of
march
eskom
chairman
jabu
mabuza
said
wednesday
s
support
would
cover
of
the
company
s
annual
needs
it
is
never
going
to
be
enough
but
it
is
what
can
be
found
in
the
circumstances
mabuza
told
cnbc
africa
we
need
to
put
more
pressure
on
our
operational
he
said
the
utility
hoped
the
energy
regulator
would
agree
to
the
large
tariff
hikes
eskom
had
requested
when
it
announces
a
decision
around
the
regulator
has
in
the
past
tended
to
approve
smaller
increases
that
eskom
has
asked
for
some
business
leaders
wanted
more
detail
on
how
eskom
s
debt
mountain
would
be
reduced
over
the
longer
term
eskom
received
a
billion
rand
bailout
in
via
a
loan
which
was
later
converted
into
equity
the
government
later
sold
state
assets
to
give
it
another
billion
rand
we
were
hoping
that
the
government
was
going
to
look
at
debt
and
take
some
of
the
burden
off
the
utility
but
unfortunately
that
didn
t
materialise
said
tanya
cohen
chief
executive

eskom
s
turned
off
the
lights
across
swathes
of
the
country
last
week
due
to
problems
diesel
shortages
and
planned
maintenance
the
outages
exposed
the
risks
to
the
economy
from
eskom
s
virtual
monopoly
and
the
failure
of
successive
governments
to
take
on
labour
unions
and
factions
in
the
anc
who
consider
any
form
of
privatisation
as
a
red
line
the

ministry
said
on
wednesday
that
strategic
equity
partners
would
be
invited
to
provide
capital

strengthen
oversight
