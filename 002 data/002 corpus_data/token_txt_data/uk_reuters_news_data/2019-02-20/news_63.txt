tokyo
feb
reuters
commonwealth
lng
has
received
commitments
from
european
buyers
to
take
almost
half
of
the
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
from
its
planned
export
terminal
in
louisiana
chief
executive
officer
paul
varello
said
on
wednesday
the
commonwealth
project
is
one
of
more
than
lng
export
terminals
under
development
or
construction
in
the
united
states
along
the
coast
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
take
advantage
of
soaring
demand
for
the
supercooled
fuel
amid
booming
gas
production
we
are
exchanging
documents
with
counterparties
that
will
represent
three
to
four
million
tonnes
of
capacity
varello
told
reuters
in
an
interview
adding
he
expects
to
sign
heads
of
agreements
hoa
shortly
we
have
to
work
hard
to
get
closer
to
the
full
million
tonnes
in
heads
of
agreements
to
allow
us
to
feel
good
about
getting
million
tonnes
in
final
agreements
he
said
because
prospective
buyers
are
overcommitting
to
projects
our
bankers
say
that
if
we
can
decent
pricing
with
million
tonnes
that
will
give
us
enough
debt
coverage
to
make
it
work
varello
said
the
prospective
buyers
are
european
with
their
own
importing
terminals
he
said
varello
said
the
company
will
process
natural
gas
into
lng
at
the
terminal
at
well
below
per
million
british
thermal
units
for
buyers
signing
supply
contracts
the
company
expects
to
make
a
final
investment
decision
by
the
third
or
fourth
quarter
of
next
year
after
getting
final
environmental
approvals
and
aims
to
begin
shipping
lng
in
varello
who
is
in
tokyo
pitching
lng
to
importers
in
the
country
while
attending
an
industry
conference
said
japanese
buyers
were
reluctant
to
sign
agreements
the
resistance
to
signing
contracts
is
coming
because
electric
utilities
are
getting
nuclear
reactors
back
online
after
prolonged
shutdowns
following
the
fukushima
disaster
and
the
rising
use
of
renewables
varello
said
the
commonwealth
project
is
one
of
many
that
could
be
approved
this
year
and
next
as
worldwide
consumption
of
lng
is
expected
to
more
than
double
to
million
tonnes
a
year
by
gas
production
has
soared
to
new
records
bolstered
by
shale
production
increasing
the
need
for
export
capacity
to
absorb
the
supply
energy
companies
are
expected
to
make
final
decisions
on
projects
that
could
add
more
than
million
tonnes
per
year
of
lng
capacity
this
year
a
record
qatar
petroleum
and
exxon
mobil
corp
said
earlier
this
month
they
will
proceed
with
a
billion
project
that
will
expand
a
lng
export
plant
