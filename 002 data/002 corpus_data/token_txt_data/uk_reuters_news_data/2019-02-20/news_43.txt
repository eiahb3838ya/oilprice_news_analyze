paris
reuters
air
pledged
new
efficiency
gains
to
offset
higher
fuel
costs
this
year
as
the
airline
group
deepens
cooperation
between
its
two
main
carriers
presenting
earnings
for
the
group
he
joined
in
september
chief
executive
ben
smith
promised
networks
and
fleets
after
overcoming
klm
resistance
to
closer
integration
with
air
france
in
a
new
boardroom
deal
these
first
achievements
pave
the
way
for
our
ambition
to
regain
a
leading
position
in
europe
and
worldwide
smith
said
after
opening
lower
air
shares
rose
percent
to
euros
at
gmt
underlining
smith
s
challenge
earnings
before
interest
tax
depreciation
and
amortization
ebitda
fell
pct
to
million
euros
million
as
the
fuel
bill
mounted
despite
a
percent
revenue
gain
to
billion
unit
revenue
fell
pct
in
the
last
three
months
of
and
will
decline
further
in
the
current
quarter
the
group
said
air
has
trailed
rivals
lufthansa
and
british
airways
on
profitability
held
back
by
restrictive
french
union
deals
and
strikes
that
last
year
wiped
million
euros
off
earnings
and
forced
out
its
previous
ceo
but
smith
an
air
canada
veteran
has
restored
labor
peace
by
granting
wage
hikes
in
return
for
increased
flexibility
with
which
he
now
hopes
to
make
better
and
more
profitable
use
of
the
group
s
aircraft
and
networks
on
the
eve
of
the
results
presentation
air
struck
a
new
pay
deal
with
its
french
pilots
and
resolved
a
standoff
with
klm
and
the
dutch
division
s
popular
leader
pieter
elbers
over
smith
s
integration
plans
wariness
on
the
dutch
side
is
partly
explained
by
the
relative
underperformance
of
air
france
whose
operating
margin
was
percent
or
percent
excluding
the
impact
of
strikes
compared
with
percent
for
klm
almost
years
after
the
air
merger
decisions
on
networks
fleets
and
commercial
strategy
will
now
be
taken
by
the
group
rather
than
the
individual
carriers
under
the
plans
unveiled
on
tuesday
which
also
see
elbers
and
air
france
counterpart
anne
rigail
become
deputy
group
ceos
the
financials
were
broadly
in
line
with
expectations
of
million
euros
of
ebitda
on
billion
in
revenue
based
on
the
median
of
seven
analyst
estimates
in
a
poll
by
infront
data
while
a
new
ceo
with
an
impressive
track
record
has
been
appointed
and
pay
deals
agreed
with
the
french
unions
we
await
details
of
his
new
strategy
liberum
analysts
said
in
a
note
the
fuel
bill
rose
by
million
euros
in
and
will
climb
another
million
this
year
as
hedges
expire
chief
financial
officer
frederic
gagey
told
reporters
on
a
call
overall
unit
costs
up
percent
last
year
before
currency
and
impacts
were
well
under
control
gagey
said
adding
that
while
a
later
easter
holiday
will
likely
lead
to
lower
unit
revenue
in
the
first
quarter
summer
bookings
are
already
better
positioned
the
group
said
costs
are
expected
to
come
in
somewhere
between
flat
and
a
percent
decline
on
the
same
basis
passenger
traffic
rose
pct
to
million
in
the
last
quarter
the
group
said
while
crossing
the
million
threshold
for
the
full
year
the
transavia
arm
was
a
bright
spot
posting
a
percent
operating
margin
for
its
french
operations
as
it
expand
services
by
percent
in
with
a
more
modest
percent
growth
at
group
level
to
include
eight
new
air
france
destinations
from
the
new
labor
deals
should
provide
a
financial
lift
in
the
cfo
said
avoiding
the
strikes
and
disruption
that
led
to
a
spike
in
air
france
s
customer
compensation
bill
last
year
the
rollout
of
new
digital
sales
platforms
will
also
generate
savings
along
with
improvements
to
network
planning
and
the
gradual
replacement
of
less
airbus
and
boeing
planes
the
management
changes
may
boost
efforts
to
increase
synergies
in
areas
such
as
purchasing
which
lacked
a
single
chief
procurement
officer
until
last
year
smith
s
centralization
push
builds
on
years
of
painstaking
integration
that
had
already
assigned
some
staff
to
services
and
managers
said
gagey
who
joined
air
france
in
it
s
not
as
if
we
just
realized
we
should
begin
to
look
for
synergies
