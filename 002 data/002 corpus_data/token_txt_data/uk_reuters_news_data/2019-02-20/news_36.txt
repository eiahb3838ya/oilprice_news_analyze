senegalese
fisherman
diabel
mbeguere
credits
the
government
s
modernisation
programme
with
helping
to
keep
him
in
work
so
he
ll
be
voting
for
incumbent
macky
sall
in
sunday
s
presidential
election
mbeguere
says
the
fish
have
got
smaller
and
are
swimming
a
lot
futher
out
in
the
atlantic
ocean
than
they
were
years
ago
he
blames
climate
change
while
others
also
cite
increased
competition
for
limited
resources
but
thanks
to
sall
s
subsidy
programme
for
an
industry
that
accounts
for
around
percent
of
senegal
s
labour
force
mbeguere
s
pirogue
now
has
an
engine
that
allows
him
to
go
further
afield
for
his
daily
catch
for
those
of
us
who
live
off
fishing
we
are
satisfied
he
said
some
of
his
fellow
fishermen
were
still
waiting
to
get
their
boats
upgraded
however
so
we
hope
macky
sall
will
get
a
second
mandate
so
all
the
fishermen
get
what
they
need
he
said
