london
reuters
saudi
arabia
has
resumed
its
traditional
role
as
the
swing
producer
sharply
reducing
its
own
output
to
tighten
the
oil
market
and
push
prices
higher
the
de
facto
opec
leader
has
demonstrated
once
again
that
it
can
always
tighten
the
physical
market
boost
prices
and
push
the
calendar
spread
into
backwardation
if
it
is
prepared
to
cut
its
own
production
enough
the
familiar
problem
is
that
protecting
prices
comes
at
the
expense
of
market
share
the
more
the
kingdom
cuts
its
own
production
and
tightens
the
market
the
more
it
encourages
increased
output
from
other
sources
in
this
case
rising
prices
threaten
to
extend
the
oil
drilling
and
production
boom
in
the
united
states
which
would
ultimately
force
saudi
arabia
to
make
even
deeper
cuts
or
abandon
its
strategy
saudi
arabia
has
never
been
able
to
escape
from
this
dilemma
and
the
country
s
oil
policy
has
cycled
between
a
priority
on
price
defence
and
volume
defence
chartbook
the
kingdom
has
always
struggled
to
craft
an
exit
strategy
from
periods
of
output
restraint
policymakers
pursue
production
curbs
for
too
long
tighten
the
market
too
much
and
drive
prices
to
an
unsustainable
level
the
result
is
usually
a
slowdown
in
consumption
growth
and
an
acceleration
of
sources
of
production
that
pushes
the
market
back
towards
surplus
and
necessitates
a
new
round
of
output
cuts
the
kingdom
made
the
same
mistake
in
and
failing
to
raise
production
early
enough
creating
the
conditions
for
unsustainable
price
inflation
and
sowing
the
seeds
of
the
subsequent
downturns
like
any
oil
exporter
saudi
arabia
will
always
benefit
from
an
increase
in
prices
in
the
short
term
but
it
can
then
prove
difficult
to
put
a
lid
on
the
market
saudi
arabia
s
informal
price
targets
tend
to
ratchet
up
as
realised
prices
rise
with
its
targets
tending
to
be
somewhat
elastic
in
the
first
nine
months
of
saudi
arabia
allowed
the
market
to
tighten
too
much
pushing
prices
above
that
proved
unsustainable
and
triggered
a
slowdown
in
consumption
growth
and
a
surge
in
shale
the
kingdom
s
market
management
was
not
helped
by
a
mercurial
white
house
which
threatened
to
push
iran
s
oil
exports
to
zero
and
then
granted
generous
sanctions
waivers
the
question
is
whether
the
saudis
will
make
the
same
mistake
again
in
experience
suggests
it
will
senior
saudi
officials
have
often
sought
to
downplay
the
tag
since
the
when
the
kingdom
cut
production
even
as
other
countries
raised
theirs
they
have
been
keen
to
emphasise
the
importance
of
spreading
cuts
across
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
more
recently
an
enlarged
group
including
russia
and
oman
but
the
historical
record
shows
that
cuts
by
saudi
arabia
have
been
decisive
in
influencing
spot
prices
and
calendar
spreads
and
that
saudi
arabia
rather
than
opec
or
is
the
true
swing
producer
by
cutting
its
own
production
saudi
arabia
has
always
been
able
to
engineer
a
rise
in
brent
spot
prices
and
push
the
calendar
spread
into
backwardation
as
the
attached
charts
illustrate
the
kingdom
s
influence
is
enhanced
when
the
global
oil
economy
and
oil
consumption
are
growing
strongly
and
when
the
output
of
rival
producers
is
disrupted
by
war
sanctions
or
civil
unrest
saudi
arabia
has
preferred
to
assemble
coalitions
of
other
producers
to
maximise
its
price
leverage
and
for
diplomatic
reasons
opec
and
provide
a
useful
shield
against
international
criticism
but
saudi
output
policy
has
been
the
primary
driver
of
market
prices
and
spreads
as
the
kingdom
has
been
the
only
exporter
with
the
scale
and
flexibility
to
shift
the
global
balance
the
recent
round
of
production
cuts
agreed
by
at
the
start
of
december
has
conformed
to
this
pattern
the
opec
and
ministerial
meeting
concludes
opec
the
enlarged
group
agreed
to
cut
by
a
total
of
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
the
first
six
months
of
with
reductions
to
be
shared
between
opec
million

and
its
allies
million
bpd
in
the
event
saudi
arabia
cut
its
own
output
by
million
bpd
in
january
exceeding
its
pledged
share
of
bpd
and
accounting
for
more
than
half
of
the
total
cuts
achieved
by
opec
in
the
first
month
saudi
arabia
s
aggressive
reductions
have
compensated
for
poor
compliance
with
the
agreement
by
some
other
opec
and
members

the
kingdom
has
gone
further
and
pledged
to
reduce
its
output
by
more
than
million
bpd
from
in
november
to
only
million
in
march
oil
minister
khalid
said
in
a
recent
interview
with
the
financial
times
the
kingdom
s
shift
has
helped
to
boost
brent
futures
prices
by
more
than
a
barrel
percent
since
late
december
and
push
the
calendar
spread
from
a
contango
to
cent
backwardation
the
price
impact
has
been
assisted
by
increased
optimism
that
the
global
economy
will
avert
recession
as
well
as
the
impact
of
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
oil
production
and
by
hedge
funds
provided
that
the
global
economy
avoids
recession
or
a
prolonged
slowdown
this
year
the
oil
market
will
tighten
progressively
over
the
course
of
given
their
approach
last
year
saudi
arabia
and
are
likely
to
prolong
their
output
restraint
until
prices
are
well
above
perhaps
breaching
the
result
will
be
another
spurt
of
shale
production
and
a
slowdown
in
oil
consumption
growth
pushing
the
market
back
towards
surplus
and
necessitating
another
round
of
cuts
if
saudi
arabia
and
want
to
halt
this
cycle
of
instability
they
need
to
be
and
start
relaxing
output
curbs
gradually
as
prices
climb
above
but
opec
has
never
been
great
at
and
the
track
record
suggests
prices
are
likely
to
overshoot
on
the
upside
to
set
the
cycle
in
motion
all
over
again
