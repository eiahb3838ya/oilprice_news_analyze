australia
s
three
east
coast
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
plants
are
unlikely
to
ever
run
at
their
combined
full
capacity
of
million
tonnes
a
year
as
there
is
not
enough
gas
to
feed
them
and
meet
local
demand
a
study
released
on
thursday
said
the
three
plants
queensland
curtis
lng
australia
pacific
lng
and
gladstone
lng
were
the
world
s
first
lng
exporters
to
use
coal
seam
gas
rather
than
gas
from
conventional
fields
but
the
wells
they
source
their
gas
from
in
australia
s
surat
and
bowen
basins
in
queensland
state
have
turned
out
to
be
less
productive
than
expected
as
a
result
the
three
plants
each
with
two
processing
units
have
been
running
below
capacity
operating
at
average
percent
in
unfortunately
there
are
serious
headwinds
coming
and
the
outlook
is
less
rosy
as
the
industry
by
building
three
projects
of
six
trains

in
a
detailed
study
of
government
and
company
drilling
and
production
data
and
reserves
booked
at
coal
seam
gas
csg
prospects
and
licenses
it
found
that
only
percent
of
booked
proven
and
probable
reserves
had
shown
any
commercial
productivity
the
emerging
and
critical
shortages
are
resulting
from
the
fact
the
csg
lng
projects
were
sanctioned
on
ambitious
estimates
of
proved
and
probable
reserves
not
proven
reserves
that
underpin
conventional
lng
projects
bethune
said
he
predicted
that
by
at
least
two
trains
would
have
to
be
shut
to
keep
four
trains
running
at
full
capacity
which
would
reduce
exports
to
around
million
tonnes
a
year
down
from
about
million
tonnes
in
about
percent
of
exports
go
to
china
percent
to
south
korea
and
percent
to
japan
exacerbating
the
problem
the
producers
have
come
under
pressure
to
step
up
gas
sales
into
the
domestic
market
with
supply
in
australia
s
southeast
falling
as
ageing
offshore
fields
dry
up
and
as
states
restrict
drilling
onshore
the
three
projects
supplied
about
percent
of
australia
s
eastern
demand
in
with
dwindling
production
from
southern
gas
fields
the
political
pressure
on
the
lng
producers
to
divert
gas
to
the
domestic
market
is
likely
to
intensify
