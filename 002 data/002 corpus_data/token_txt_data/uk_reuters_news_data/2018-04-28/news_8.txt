said
on
saturday
a
mounting
trade
spat
between
the
united
states
and
china
was
one
of
the
most
pressing
concerns
for
southeast
asian
nations
lee
flagged
his
concerns
in
remarks
made
as
he
opened
a
summit
of
the
association
of
southeast
asian
nations
asean
for
many
of
which
the
united
states
and
china
are
the
top
two
trading
partners
in
particular
the
recent
trade
tensions
between
the
and
china
are
worrying
concerns
lee
said
as
asean
members
gather
for
the
organisation
s
summit
the
trump
administration
has
threatened
to
impose
tariffs
on
up
to
billion
of
chinese
imports
and
beijing
has
vowed
retaliation
against
american
exports
on
saturday
lee
said
the
open
and
multilateral
trading
system
which
has
backed
the
growth
of
asean
member
states
has
come
under
pressure
as
the
political
mood
in
many
countries
has
shifted
against
free
trade
also
on
the
agenda
at
the
summit
were
the
humanitarian
crisis
in
myanmar
and
security
tensions
in
the
disputed
south
china
sea
but
it
was
unclear
how
much
substantive
progress
could
be
accomplished
the
situation
in
myanmar
s
western
state
of
rakhine
where
hundreds
of
thousands
of
minority
rohingya
muslims
have
fled
for
neighbouring
bangladesh
after
a
military
crackdown
is
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
facing
the
group
asean
formed
more
than
half
a
century
ago
has
struggled
with
challenges
facing
the
region
because
it
works
by
consensus
and
is
reluctant
to
get
involved
in
matters
considered
internal
to
its
members
singapore
is
this
year
s
chair
of
the
bloc
which
includes
myanmar
laos
cambodia
the
philippines
thailand
indonesia
malaysia
brunei
and
vietnam
lee
said
asean
members
individually
will
find
it
difficult
to
make
an
impact
on
regional
and
global
challenges
and
called
on
its
leaders
to
boost
integration
and
cooperation
to
make
a
mark
and
to
be
effective
the
group
is
working
on
initiatives
to
jointly
tackle
the
threat
of
extremism
and
cyber
attacks
as
well
as
to
promote
trade
and
systems
asean
is
also
working
to
devise
a
model
extradition
treaty
and
negotiating
a
code
of
conduct
with
china
to
ease
tensions
in
the
disputed
south
china
sea
one
of
the
world
s
most
volatile
hotspots
and
one
of
its
busiest
waterways
