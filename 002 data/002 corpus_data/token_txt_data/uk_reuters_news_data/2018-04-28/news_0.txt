the

threatens
animal
life
including
endemic
species
of

and
people
s
access
to
water
used
for
drinking
fishing
and

there
is
a
tsunami
of
hydropower
dam
constructions
happening
here
and
nobody
really
knows
about
it

investment
in
renewable
energy
projects
is
growing
around
the
world
as
countries
rush
to
meet
clean
energy
goals
under
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
the
eu
aims
to
source
at
least
percent
of
the
bloc
s
energy
from
renewables
by
western
balkan
countries
including
bosnia
kosovo
montenegro
and
serbia
plan
to
invest
billions
of
euros
in
building
new
plants
to
meet
rising
demand
for
electricity
as
old
plants
are
being
phased
out
hydropower
is
already
widely
used
across
the
region
but
environmentalists
fear
the
investment
in
coal
could
backfire
as
governments
may
be
forced
to
invest
hundreds
of
millions
of
euros
more
to
upgrade
plants
to
meet
european
union
environmental
standards
as
the
countries
progress
toward
membership
of
the
bloc
the
european
bank
for
reconstruction
and
development
ebrd
is
funding
some
hydropower
projects
in
the
balkans
and
has
agreed
to
foster
a
transition
towards
sustainable
economies
int
the
region
ulrich
eichelmann
head
of
campaign
group
riverwatch
said
clean
energy
such
as
hydropower
could
have
negative
effects
on
the
environment
just
because
it
doesn
t
emit
it
doesn
t
mean
it
s
good
eichelmann
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
nature
of
most
of
the
projects
in
the
balkans
is
particularly
damaging
because
water
is
diverted
through
pipelines
leaving
empty
channels
where
rivers
used
to
be
and
causing
loss
of
fauna
and
erosion
a
report
by
consultancy
fluvius
said
the
report
said
more
than
a
third
of
the
planned
dams
are
to
be
built
in
protected
areas
including
some
in
national
parks
with
the
deluge
of
proposed
hydropower
dams
and
diversions
in
the
balkan
peninsula
we
are
looking
at
what
could
be
irreversible
environmental
destruction
but
there
is
very
little
awareness
of
this
issue
in
europe
or
globally

the
