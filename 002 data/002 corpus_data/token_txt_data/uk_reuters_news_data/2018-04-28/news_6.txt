loong
said
on
saturday
a
mounting
trade
spat
between
the
united
states
and
china
was
one
of
the
most
pressing
worries
for
southeast
asian
nations
as
their
leaders
echoed
the
concern
over
rising
protectionism
lee
flagged
his
concerns
in
remarks
made
as
he
opened
a
summit
of
the
association
of
southeast
asian
nations
asean
for
many
of
which
the
united
states
and
china
are
the
top
two
trading
partners
in
particular
the
recent
trade
tensions
between
the
and
china
are
worrying
concerns
he
said
singapore
occupies
the
group
s
rotating
chair
for
this
year
we
are
deeply
concerned
over
the
rising
tide
of
protectionism
and
sentiments
said
a
statement
issued
on
behalf
of
the
asean
chair
at
the
end
of
summit
talks
the
trump
administration
has
threatened
to
impose
tariffs
on
up
to
billion
of
chinese
imports
and
beijing
has
vowed
retaliation
against
american
exports
on
saturday
lee
said
the
open
and
multilateral
trading
system
which
has
backed
the
growth
of
asean
has
come
under
pressure
as
the
political
mood
in
many
countries
has
shifted
against
free
trade
there
was
little
progress
on
the
push
to
resolve
the
humanitarian
crisis
in
myanmar
despite
a
fresh
plea
by
asean
leaders
for
myanmar
to
implement
the
recommendations
of
an
international
panel
the
situation
in
myanmar
s
western
state
of
rakhine
where
hundreds
of
thousands
of
minority
rohingya
muslims
have
fled
for
neighbouring
bangladesh
after
a
military
crackdown
is
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
facing
the
asean
group
lee
said
negotiations
for
a
code
of
conduct
in
the
south
china
sea
had
started
last
month
between
asean
and
china
and
there
was
hope
for
an
early
conclusion
four
asean
member
states
have
claims
to
the
disputed
south
china
sea
one
of
the
world
s
most
volatile
hotspots
and
one
of
its
busiest
waterways
we
emphasised
the
importance
of
and
in
the
conduct
of
all
activities
by
claimants
and
all
other
states
that
could
further
complicate
the
situation
and
escalate
tensions
in
the
south
china
sea
the
chair
s
statement
said
asean
formed
more
than
half
a
century
ago
has
struggled
with
challenges
facing
the
region
because
it
works
by
consensus
and
is
reluctant
to
get
involved
in
matters
considered
internal
to
its
members
singapore

this
year

chair
of
the

is
working
on
initiatives
to
jointly
tackle
the
threat
of
extremism
and
cyber
attacks
as
well
as
to
promote
trade
and
systems
meanwhile
asean
