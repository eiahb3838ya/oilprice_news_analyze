co
the
key
chinese
conduit
for
transactions
with
iran
is
set
to
halt
handling
payments
from
the
islamic
republic
under
pressure
of
imminent
sanctions
against
the
country
four
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
kunlun
the
main
official
channel
for
money
flows
between
china
and
iran
has
verbally
informed
clients
that
it
will
stop
accepting
iranian
payments
to
china
from
said
the
sources
who
include
external
loan
agents
and
business
officials
who
trade
with
iran
the
bank
controlled
by
the
financial
arm
of
chinese
state
energy
group
cnpc
had
already
quietly
suspended
payments
from
iran
in
late
august
the
four
sources
said
declining
to
be
named
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
matter
kunlun
did
not
respond
to
an
emailed
request
seeking
comment
a
cnpc
spokesman
declined
comment
it
was
not
immediately
clear
how
long
the
suspension
of
services
will
last
and
how
chinese
businesses
still
selling
goods
or
services
to
iran
would
be
able
to
receive
payment
it
was
also
not
clear
whether
the
bank
s
services
settling
china
s
payments
for
iranian
oil
purchases
would
be
affected
china
is
the
top
buyer
of
iranian
oil
and
nearly
all
of
its
oil
payments
go
through
kunlun
china
had
been
buying
some
billion
worth
of
oil
each
month
from
iran
as
recently
as
september
but
state
refiners
have
since
october
been
scaling
back
oil
purchases
from
iran
to
comply
with
looming
sanctions
oil
industry
sources
have
said
the
previously
unreported
moves
by
kunlun
highlight
the
mounting
pressure
beijing
faces
as
washington
reimposes
sanctions
targeting
iran
s
financial
and
oil
sectors
from
early
november
a
kunlun
account
manager
told
us
payments
from
iran
made
after
that
date
will
be
rejected
and
returned
said
one
of
the
sources
an
agent
who
serves
as
a
for
the
bank
and
corporate
borrowers
whether
and
when
to
resume
the
services
depends
on
the
international
situation
after
the
sanctions
start
on
said
another
one
of
the
sources
a
businesswoman
citing
a
wechat
message
from
her
trade
agent
recounting
what
she
had
heard
from
kunlun
the
agent
urged
her
in
the
message
to
hurry
up
payment
collections
the
person
said
the
new
round
of
sanctions
aims
to
force
tehran
to
stop
its
involvement
in
regional
conflicts
in
syria
yemen
and
iraq
and
halt
its
ballistic
missile
programme
after
president
donald
trump
abandoned
a
deal
between
iran
and
six
world
powers
aimed
at
curbing
tehran
s
nuclear
plans
china
has
said
it
is
opposed
to
any
unilateral
sanctions

has
defended

capital
the
bank
s
latest
annual
report
shows
early
this
decade
kunlun
was
chosen
by
beijing
as
its
main
bank
to
process
billions
of
dollars
in
oil
payments
to
iran
shielding
other
banks
from
penalties
under
western
sanctions
that
ran
between
and
the

sanctioned
kunlun
in
for
conducting
business
with
iran
and
transferring
money
to
an
entity

the

the
sanctions
barred
kunlun
from
directly
accessing
the
financial

the
bank

are
conducted
in

euros
two
of
the

said
kunlun

moves
to
suspend
euro
settlement
in
august
and
yuan
starting
next
month
were
triggered
by
sanctions

did
not
give
further
details
we
were
told
that
from
kunlun
would
no
longer
receive
payments
from
iran

means
iran
will
have
to
stop
importing
from
china

iran
