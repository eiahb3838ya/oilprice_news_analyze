the
global
economic
outlook
is
deteriorating
with
a
broad
range
of
asset
prices
and
economic
indicators
pointing
to
either
a
slowdown
in
growth
or
an
outright
recession
occurring
in
south
korea
s
equity
index
has
now
fallen
by
almost
percent
over
the
last
year
the
fastest
rate
of
decline
since
the
financial
crisis
of
in
a
warning
sign
for
investors
and
commodity
traders
the
has
correlated
closely
with
the
growth
in
international
trade
given
the
south
korean
economy
s
strong
export
orientation
so
the
sharp
decline
suggests
trade
growth
will
slow
sharply
in
the
months
ahead
germany
s
dax
index
another
share
market
heavily
exposed
to
international
trade
has
also
fallen
by
more
than
percent
over
the
last
year
its
worst
performance
since
early
and
before
that
even
in
the
united
states
which
is
much
more
closed
to
international
trade
and
has
reported
the
strongest
economy
and
stock
market
in
there
are
signs
the
bull
run
is
running
out
of
momentum
the
broad
s
p
equity
index
is
up
just
percent
compared
with
the
end
of
october
the
smallest
increase
for
almost
two
years
and
far
below
its
peak
of
percent
at
the
start
of
the
stimulus
of
corporate
tax
reductions
which
went
into
effect
at
the
start
of

to
fade

a
signal
that
has
often
preceded
a
slowdown
in
growth
or
recession
in

past
the

remains
close
to
its
highest
value
for
a
quarter
of

against
a
basket

of

the
combination
of
a

a
flattening

curve
falling

prices
and
a
strengthening
dollar
represents
a
significant
tightening
of
financial
conditions
not
just
in
the
united
states
but
around
the
world
the
oecd
s
composite
leading
indicator
has
fallen
to
its
lowest
in
almost
two
years
and
is
at
a
level
that
is
consistent
with
a
slowdown
in
economic
momentum
rising
oil
prices
especially
for
consuming
countries
outside
the
united
states
have
added
to
the
pressure
on
many
emerging

freight
movements
also
indicate
the
rate
of
growth
is
easing
after
accelerating
consistently
for
two
years
between

middle

rail
freight

are
still
rising

a
slightly
slower
rate
than
in
the
first
half
of

truck

has
seen
an
even
sharper
slowdown
since
peaking

total
freight

by
road
rail
barge

were
about

higher

a
year
ago
down
from
a
peak
of
more
than
percent
in
june
on
their
own
any
of
these
financial
and
real
indicators
could
be
dismissed
as
due
to
idiosyncratic
factors
but
in
combination
when
they
all
point
in
the
same
direction
they
point
to
a
loss
of
momentum
in
the
global
economy
the

at
this
point
it
is
impossible
to
know
whether
the
slowdown
will
take
the
form
of
a
moderation
in
the
rate
of
growth
a
growth
recession
or
an
actual
decline
in
activity
an
outright
recession
deep
recessions
such
as
the
one
which
accompanied
the
financial

in
are
uncommon
and
unlikely
to
be
repeated
this
time
around
most
recessions
since
have
involved
either
a
mild
slowdown
in
the
rate
of
growth
or
a
very
small
and
decline
in
economic
activity
but
most
indicators
now
point
to
significantly
slower
growth
next
