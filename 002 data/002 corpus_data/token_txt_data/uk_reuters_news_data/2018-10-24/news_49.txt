broader
market
sentiment
remains
fragile
but
as
last
night
s
resilience
by
wall
street
shows
sentiment
has
not
broken
down
completely
said
junichi
ishikawa
senior
fx
strategist
at
ig
securities
in
tokyo
we
may
see
more
bouts
of
mini
panic
until
the
midterm
elections
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
economy
is
in
good
shape
and
that
should
prevent
sentiment
from
breaking
the
dollar
rebounded
modestly
against
the
yen

the
canadian
dollar
took
in
stride
the
sharp
decline

firm

its
counterpart
as
investors
maintained
bets
that
the
bank
of
canada
boc
will
hike
interest
rates
later
on
wednesday
the
canadian
dollar
stood
little
changed
at
c
per
dollar
after
gaining
percent
the
previous
day
we
do
not
believe
that
the
declines
in
the
markets
so
far
are
enough
to
dissuade
either
the
fed
or
the
boc
from
continuing
to
hike
interest
rates
as
soon
as
today

the
case
of
the
boc
