a
rare
oil
conference
in
the
eastern
city
of
benghazi
on
wednesday
as
its
state
oil
firm
noc
reached
out
to
a
region
home
to
a
parallel
government
backing
a
rival
oil
firm
the
benghazi
oil
and
gas
exhibition
and
forum
is
the
first
international
business
conference
in
libya
s
city
since
when
it
turned
into
a
battlefield
forces
of
khalifa
haftar
declared
victory
in
july
over
islamists
ending
four
years
of
fighting
that
destroyed
parts
of
the
port
city
hotels
and
benghazi
airport
have
reopened
but
several
bombings
killed
dozens
of
people
this
year
forcing
organisers
to
postpone
the
conference
until
security
had
improved
benghazi
city
will
play
a
prominent
and
important
role
for
the
oil
and
gas
sector
in
the
region
and
probably
the
world
noc
chairman
mustafa
sanalla
said
in
his
opening
comments
marking
a
rare
public
speech
in
benghazi
an
executive
of
oil
services
firm
schlumberger
a
partner
of
noc
said
the
event
will
be
very
important
to
us
and
we
are
looking
forward
to
interesting
discussions
no
deals
are
expected
at
the
forum
in
the
tibesti
hotel
which
aims
to
promote
an
industry
exchange
and
more
importantly
to
appease
complaints
in
the
east
about
few
government
activities
there
industry
sources
said
it
s
a
political
message
to
appease
the
east
said
the
ceo
of
a
libyan
oil
service
firm
noc
has
had
a
rocky
relationship
with
the
haftar
and
his
leadership
whose
forces
control
much
of
east
including
major
oil
ports
in
june
haftar
s
administration
said
it
wanted
to
route
oil
exports
from
the
key
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
ports
through
a
separate
noc
based
in
benghazi
after
its
troops
seized
them
back
from
a
militia
in
a
costly
battle
eastern
factions
have
long
accused
the
central
bank
in
tripoli
of
misspending
oil
revenue
and
allocating
insufficient
funds
to
the
east
noc
has
been
carefully
trying
to
stay
out
of
libya
s
conflict
stemming
from
the
toppling
of
muammar
gaddafi
in
international
oil
buyers
have
stuck
with
noc
tripoli
building
on
relationships
but
calls
for
secession
or
at
least
autonomy
remain
popular
in
the
east
known
as
cyrenaica
or
barqa
in
arabic
where
much
of
libya
s
oil
wealth
lies
but
which
was
long
neglected
by
gaddafi
as
a
punishment
for
opposition
libya
s
government
said
in
it
was
planning
to
move
noc
s
headquarters
to
benghazi
to
reverse
gaddafi
s
decision
to
move
the
oil
leadership
to
tripoli
from
the
eastern
city
but
the
move
was
never
implemented
as
libya
split
into
rival
administrations
in
and
fighting
broke
out
in
benghazi
the
east
has
it
own
central
bank
which
has
also
been
largely
ignored
by
the
international
community
like
