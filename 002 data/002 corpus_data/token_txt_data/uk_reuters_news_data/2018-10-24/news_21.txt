rubis
plans
to
expand
parts
of
the
kenyan
business
such
as
liquefied
petroleum
gas
lpg
once
the
deal
is
concluded
we
have
become
specialists
in
lpg
and
bitumen
for
instance
the
demand
for
these
kind
of
products
is
very
strong
in
kenya
and
other

to
address
that

foothold
in

where
it
currently
does
not
have
any

plans
to
invoke
rules
allowing
it
to
acquire
the
remaining

it
said
if
it
gets
percent
but
less
than

it
may
take
steps
to
delist
the
shares
from
the
nairobi
securities
exchange

added
kenolkobil
s
profits
increased
in
and
the
company
has
reduced
its

almost
zero

were
clearly
beautifying
the
