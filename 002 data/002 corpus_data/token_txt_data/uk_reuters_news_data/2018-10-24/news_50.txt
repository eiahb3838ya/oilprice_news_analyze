asian

concerns
ranging
from

weighed

global

have
suffered
this

italian

trade
tensions

mounting

on
saudi

over
the

saudi

looked

were
modest
however
after
a
late
round
of

helped
wall
street
indexes
pare
most
of
their
earlier
losses
wall
street
s
three
major
indexes
slumped
early
on

but
ended
well
off
the
day
s
lows
as
investors
snapped
up

late
in

session
broader
market
sentiment
remains
fragile
but
as
last
night
s
resilience
by
wall
street
shows
sentiment
has
not
broken
down
completely
said
junichi
ishikawa
senior
fx
strategist
at
ig
securities
in
tokyo
we
may
see
more
bouts
of
mini
panic
until
the
midterm
elections
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
economy
is
in
good
shape
and
that
should
prevent
sentiment
from
breaking
the
dollar
flagged
against
the
yen
which
is
often
sought
in
times
of
risk
aversion
the
currency
was
at
yen
after
dropping
percent
overnight
the
greenback
was
also
weighed
by
a
decline
in
treasury
yields
as
the
recent
risk
aversion
drove
investors
to
safe
haven
government
bonds
the
treasury
note
yield
was
at
percent
after
stooping
to
a
low
of
on
tuesday
the
canadian
dollar
shook
off
the
plunge
in
oil
and
stood
firm
against
its
counterpart
as
investors
maintained
bets
that
the
bank
of
canada
boc
will
hike
interest
rates
later
on
wednesday
the
canadian
dollar
stood
little
changed
at
c
per
dollar
after
gaining
percent
the
previous
day
we
do
not
believe
that
the
declines
in
the
markets
so
far
are
enough
to
dissuade
either
the
fed
or
the
boc
from
continuing
to
hike
interest
rates
as
soon
as
today
in
the
case
of
the
boc
wrote
carl
weinberg
chief
international
economist
at
high
frequency
economics
however
markets
will
start
to
rethink
the
need
for
tighter

modest

rose

its
modest

a
near

monday
the
pound
was
little
changed
at
and
near
a
trough
of
brushed
overnight
sterling
briefly
gained
half
a
percent
against
the
dollar
on
tuesday
after
a
media
report
that
the
european
union
could
offer
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
a
customs
union
to
clinch
a
brexit

the
