world
stocks
marked
a
sixth
straight
day
of
losses
on
wednesday
oil
prices
slumped
to
lows
and
wall
street
was
tipped
for
a
lower
open
after
fresh
signs
that
global
economic
growth
and
company
profits
may
be
losing
steam
hefty
losses
the
day
before
have
left
msci
s
benchmark
near
lows
possibly
putting
it
on
course
for
its
worst
month
in
six
years
the
index
is
now
down
percent
from
record
highs
hit
in
january
european
shares
traded
higher
however
after
approaching
lows
they
took
their
cue
from
asian
markets
which
managed
to
close
flat
after
chinese
media
reported
authorities
were
considering
allowing
insurance
firms
to
invest
in
equities
we
ve
got
to
accept
that
in
this
correction
we
have
had
on
and
off
days
a
few
days
back
markets
were
buoyant
on
back
of
an
announcement
from
china
on
fiscal
monetary
and
regulatory
stimulus
then
another
day
there
are
earnings
reports
that
are
perceived
by
investors
to
be
bad
said
andrew
milligan
head
of
global
strategy
at
aberdeen
standard
investments
but
underlying
it
all
are
half
a
dozen
issues
that
are
worrying
investors
and
none
of
them
are
going
away
factors
that
have
conspired
to
knock
markets
this
week
include
disappointing
company
earnings
a
spat
between
italy
and
the
european
union
over
italy
s
budget
criticism
of
oil
power
saudi
arabia
over
the
killing
of
a
dissident
journalist
and
finally
worries
that
world
growth
is
losing
steam
growth
worries
were
highlighted
by
the
international
monetary
fund
which
recently
cut
forecasts
citing
trade
wars
and
capital
flight
from
emerging
markets
the
latest
european
pmi
surveys
underscored
that
view
showing
german
growth
at
the
slowest
in
three
years
there
are
also
signs
economic
and
earnings
growth
fuelled
partly
by
tax
cuts
may
be
waning
wall
street
suffered
heavy
losses
on
tuesday
after
some
companies
among
them
industrial
giant
caterpillar
maintained
or
cut
profit
forecasts
european
equity
sentiment
was
hit
by
weak
pmis
but
bank
and
tech
shares
took
the
worst
beating
after
disappointing
earnings
at
the
sickly
german
giant
deutsche
bank
and
at
chipmaker
stmicroelectronics
many
of
the
reports
coming
in
are
not
that
different
to
expectations
but
the
mood
at
present
is
to
shoot
from
the
hip
first
and
ask
questions
later
milligan
said
shares
eventually
saw
some
buying
late
on
tuesday
and
closed
only
half
a
percent
lower
but
futures
for
all
three
new
york
indexes
signal
more
losses
standing
to
percent
lower
that
could
take
the
s
benchmark
beyond
tuesday
s
lows
microsoft
at
t
visa
ups
ford
and
whirlpool
are
among
companies
posting
earnings
on
wednesday
more
bouts
of
will
occur
until
midterm
elections
on
said
junichi
ishikawa
senior
fx
strategist
at
ig
securities
in
tokyo
but
as
last
night
s
resilience
by
wall
street
shows
sentiment
has
not
broken
down
growth
jitters
weighed
on
oil
prices
too
with
brent
around
almost
a
barrel
off
recent
highs
following
a
percent
slide
on
tuesday
but
prices
were
also
knocked
by
the
prospect
of
more
supply
from
saudi
arabia
which
pledged
to
pump
more
crude
quickly
if
needed
saudi
arabia
is
also
in
the
midst
of
a
diplomatic
storm
surrounding
the
death
of
jamal
khashoggi
turkey
dismissed
the
kingdom
s
efforts
to
blame
the
killing
on
rogue
operatives
while
president
donald
trump
said
riyadh
staged
the
worst
on
currencies
the
euro
fell
percent
to
the
dollar
undermined
by
the
pmi
surveys
that
showed
business
growth
in
the
area
decelerated
faster
than
expected
dragged
down
by
waning
orders
the
lacklustre
growth
picture
narrowed
the
gap
between
german
and
yields
flattening
the
yield
curve
a
classic
sign
of
growth
worries
the
flash
pmi
for
october
gives
a
first
glimpse
on
where
the
euro
zone
economy
is
heading
and
the
picture
is
not
terrific
ing
economist
peter
vanden
houte
said
the
dollar
rebounded
percent
versus
a
basket
of
currencies
while
sterling
slipped
percent
to
lows
versus
the
dollar
