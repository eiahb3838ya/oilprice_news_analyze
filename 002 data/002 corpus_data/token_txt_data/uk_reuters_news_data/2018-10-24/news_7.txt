greece
which
has
a
defence

attempts
to
tap
hydrocarbons
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
along
with
a
dispute
over
greece
s
maritime

have
revived
tensions
between
athens
and
ankara
nato
allies
who
are
separated
by
the
aegean
sea
turkey
and
the
internationally
recognised
greek
cypriot
government
in
cyprus
have
overlapping
claims
of
jurisdiction
for
offshore
oil
and
gas

in
the
eastern

plan
exploratory

akar
told
turkey
s
state
anadolu
news
agency
we
have
taken
all
kinds
of
measures
i
want
everyone
to
know
that
we
will
not
tolerate
a
fait
accompli
of
any
sort
on
this
cyprus
which
has
no
diplomatic
relations
with
turkey
accused
ankara
of
stirring
up
tensions
we
are
not
going
to
go
along
with
this
artificial
climate
of
tension
which
is
trying
to
give
an
impression
that
there
is
a
dispute
cypriot
government
spokesman
prodromos
prodromou
said
there
is
no
dispute
in
the
seas
of
breakaway
north
cyprus
which
is
supported
by
turkey
says
any
offshore
wealth
also
belongs
to
them
as
partners
in
the
establishment
of
the
cyprus
republic
in
greek
cypriots
who
run
the
island
s
internationally
recognised
government
say
any
future
benefits
of
gas
finds
will
eventually
be
shared
by
all
cypriots
the
island
was
split
in
after
a
turkish
invasion
triggered
by
a
brief
coup
countless
peacemaking
endeavours
have
failed
and
offshore
wealth
has
increasingly
been
the
elephant
in
the
room
of
peace
negotiations
even
though
greek
cypriots
say
that
matter
is
not
up
for
discussion
