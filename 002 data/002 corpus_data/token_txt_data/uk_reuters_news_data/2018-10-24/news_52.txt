foundation
in
battling
the
timber
poachers
who
roam
the
thick
sierra
madre
forests
near
his
home
larry
garaes
has
found
a
new
ally
solar
panels
with
solar
chargers
the
radios
he
and
other
forest
rangers
rely
on
no
longer
run
out
of
power
on
operations
in
the
mountains
he
said
communication
between
rangers
is
a
lot
better
now
we
can
catch
the
poachers
while
they
are
in
the
act
because
we
can
coordinate
our
moves
quietly
without
resorting
to
shouting
at
the
next
ranger
unlike
before
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
access
to
clean
energy
is
bringing
a
range
of
unexpected
benefits
around
the
world
on
the
longest
mountain
range
in
the
philippines
those
benefits
include
better
forest
protection
and
power
for
tribal
people
who
once
lacked
it
more
than
million
households
or
about
percent
of
all
households
in
the
philippines
lack
electricity
according
to
a
report
by
the
country
s
department
of
energy
about
three
quarters
are
in
remote
rural
locations
in
a
country
spread
over
thousands
of
islands
according
to
the
small
power
utilities
group
spug
which
is
trying
to
get
them
connected
because
bringing
the
national
grid
power
to
many
of
those
people
is
not
cost
effective
the
state
national
power
corporation
has
charged
spug
with
setting
up
and
running
small
power
plants
in
these
areas
so
far
such
plants
have
been
established
according
to
the
national
power
corporation
government
plans
call
for
percent
electrification
of
the
country
by
government
has
to
do
its
work
to
connect
all
those
areas
that
are
not
yet
connected
to
the
grid
said
edmundo
veloso
the
head
of
the
national
power
corporation
s
spug
unit
but
all
but
one
of
the
new
generation
plants
use
diesel
fuel
he
said
even
though
transport
of
fuel
can
be
a
big
problem
in
remote
areas
diesel
is
the
fastest
and
the
only
technology
available
at
the
moment
for
areas
diesel
is
still
the
cheapest
in
terms
of
capital
outlay
he
said
in
garaes
community
however
in
bulacan
province
in
the
northern
philippines
two
solar
are
providing
the
community
s
first
power
they
were
put
in
place
last
december
by
the
forest
foundation
philippines
a
organisation
that
aims
to
improve
forest
protection
and
the
centre
for
renewable
energy
and
sustainable
technology
crest
a
quezon
organisation
focused
on
expanding
use
of
clean
power
while
the
new
grid
was
primarily
set
up
to
help
members
of
the
local
dumagat
ethnic
group
police
the
forests
it
also
supplies
power
free
of
charge
to
common
areas
of
the
village
of
families
including
a
study
hall
and
communal
kitchens
the
forest
rangers
and
other
members
of
the
community
have
been
trained
to
troubleshoot
and
maintain
the
system
crest
officials
said
in
the
past
we
would
need
to
walk
almost
two
kilometres
to
the
nearest
village
where
there
is
electricity
to
charge
our
radios
and
cellphones
for
a
fee
garaes
said
that
was
a
burden
to
such
solar
could
fill
gaps
in
providing
electricity
to
many
remote
areas
of
the
philippines
as
they
are
cheap
to
operate
and
don
t
face
the
fuel
transport
issue
of
plants
said
sara
ahmed
an
energy
analyst
for
the
institute
for
energy
economics
and
financial
analysis
it
s
not
economically
viable
to
transfer
power
from
one
place
to
another
if
the
demand
is
not
high
that
s
why
areas
don
t
get
power
ahmed
said
this
is
where
come
in
there
is
no
need
to
build
transmission
lines
and
wires
you
can
have
power
right
there
and
then
you
save
a
lot
of
in
garaes
village
each
produces
kilowatt
of
electricity
enough
to
provide
lights
in
the
communal
kitchen
along
village
pathways
in
the
classroom
and
for
a
television
set
building
the
grid
cost
about
according
to
crest
officials
urbano
mendiola
vice
president
for
corporate
affairs
at
the
national
power
corporation
said
his
agency
was
considering
installing
hybrid
power
plants
that
combine
diesel
and
solar
power
in
some
remote
areas
a
hybrid
plant
to
power
about
households
costs
about
he
said
while
a
plant
costs
about
but
while
hybrid
plants
are
more
expensive
to
set
up
at
the
moment
they
bring
cost
savings
in
the
long
run
because
energy
from
the
sun
is
free
he
said
he
said
the
company
is
not
setting
up
plants
in
remote
areas
at
the
moment
because
of
the
cost
of
the
batteries
needed
to
store
solar
power
and
provide
energy
at
night
rural
power
plants
in
the
philippines
are
funded
by
the
government
and
by
a
small
surcharge
on
the
electrical
bills
of
grid
power
users
aimed
at
bringing
the
cost
of
power
for
rural
users
closer
in
line
with
that
in
urban
areas
ahmed
said
that
tapping
the
full
potential
of
renewable
energy
would
require
a
in
the
views
of
officials
tasked
with
providing
energy
currently
they
say
diesel
is
the
most
affordable
option
but
diesel
is
not
affordable
when
they
say
it
s
cheaper
they
only
mean
upfront
she
said
if
you
look
at
wind
and
solar
the
prices
have
dramatically
gone
down
ahmed
said
spug
needs
to
update
itself
