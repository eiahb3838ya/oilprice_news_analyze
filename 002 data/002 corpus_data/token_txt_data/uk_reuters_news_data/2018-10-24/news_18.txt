much
drawdown
in
gasoline
and
diesel
inventories
augured
a
seasonal
increase
in
refining
demand
however
traders
remain
concerned
about
worldwide
demand
and
that
weakness
in
global
equities
would
also
reduce

the

the

pretty
good

said
that

heating

approaches
prices
had
slumped
as
forecasters
such
as
the
international

predicted
slower
growth
for
weakness
in
equities
has
also
weighed
on
crude
notwithstanding
the
last
few
days
of
selloffs
in

i
need
to
see
a
lot
more
evidence
before
we
can
start
talking
about
a
slowdown
in
demand

with

not
planning
to
load

saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
on
tuesday
that
saudi
arabia
would
step
up
to
meet
any
demand
that
materializes
to
ensure
customers
are
satisfied
some
analysts
say
prices
could
rebound
before
the
end
of
the
year
we
feel
that
surprises
going
forward
with
the
run
up
to
the
november
deadline
are
more
apt
to
be
bullish
than
bearish
despite
saudi
assurances
of
stronger
production
