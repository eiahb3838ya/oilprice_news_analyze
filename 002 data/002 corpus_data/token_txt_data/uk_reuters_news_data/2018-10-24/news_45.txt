world
stocks
marked
a
sixth
straight
day
losses
on
wednesday
as
fears
about
global
economic
growth
kept
sentiment
fragile
with
wall
street
tipped
for
a
weak
open
and
oil
prices
languishing
near
lows
european
shares
opened
higher
taking
a
cue
from
asia
where
msci
s
asian
index
closed
flat
following
a
bounce
in
china
where
local
media
reported
authorities
were
mulling
allowing
insurance
firms
to
invest
in
equities
a
equity
index
rose
percent
after
approaching
lows
on
tuesday
shrugging
off
poor
bank
earnings
while
msci
s
index
hovered
just
off
flat
after
touching
lows
chinese
shares
closed
percent
higher
we
ve
got
to
accept
that
in
this
correction
we
have
had
on
and
off
days
a
few
days
back
markets
were
buoyant
on
back
of
an
announcement
from
china
on
fiscal
monetary
and
regulatory
stimulus
then
another
day
there
are
earnings
reports
that
are
perceived
by
investors
to
be
bad
said
andrew
milligan
head
of
global
strategy
at
aberdeen
standard
investments
but
underlying
it
all
are
half
a
dozen
issues
that
are
worrying
investors
and
none
of
them
are
going
away
several
factors
have
conspired
to
knock
markets
this
week
some
earnings
disappointment
a
brewing
conflict
between
italy
and
the
european
union
over
budget
spending
criticism
of
oil
power
saudi
arabia
over
the
killing
of
a
dissident
journalist
and
finally
worries
that
world
growth
is
losing
steam
growth
worries
were
highlighted
by
the
international
monetary
fund
imf
which
recently
cut
economic
forecasts
citing
trade
wars
and
capital
flight
from
emerging
markets
latest
european
pmi
surveys
underscored
that
view
showing
german
growth
at
the
slowest
in
three
years
there
are
also
signs
a
burst
of
economic
and
earnings
growth
fueled
partly
by
tax
cuts
may
be
waning
wall
street
suffered
heavy
losses
on
tuesday
after
some
companies
including
industrial
giant
caterpillar
which
is
seen
as
an
economic
growth
bellwether
maintained
or
cut
profit
forecasts
the
shares
pared
losses
towards
close
of
trade
and
closed
only
half
a
percent
lower
but
futures
for
all
three
new
york
indexes
were
percent
lower
junichi
ishikawa
senior
fx
strategist
at
ig
securities
in
tokyo
predicted
more
bouts
of
until
midterm
elections
but
he
added
that
as
last
night
s
resilience
by
wall
street
shows
sentiment
has
not
broken
down
growth
jitters
also
weighed
on
oil
prices
with
brent
around
almost
a
barrel
off
recent
highs
following
a
percent
slide
on
tuesday
but
prices
were
also
knocked
by
the
prospect
of
more
supply
from
saudi
arabia
which
pledged
to
pump
more
crude
quickly
if
needed
saudi
arabia
is
also
in
the
midst
of
a
diplomatic
storm
surrounding
the
death
of
jamal
khashoggi
after
turkey
dismissed
the
kingdom
s
efforts
to
blame
it
on
rogue
operatives
while
president
donald
trump
said
riyadh
staged
the
worst
however
saudi
equity
markets
have
rebounded
from
recent
lows
and
traded
percent
higher
thanks
to
strong
company
earnings
on
currency
markets
the
euro
was
undermined
by
purchasing
manager
surveys
that
showed
slowing
growth
in
manufacturing
and
new
orders
in
germany
and
france
the
single
currency
fell
half
a
percent
against
the
dollar
while
the
greenback
rebounded
percent
versus
a
basket
of
currencies
sterling
slipped
percent
to
a
new
week
low
versus
the
dollar
trapped
in
a
narrow
range
as
uncertainty
reigned
over
britain
s
eu
exit
the
lacklustre
growth
picture
narrowed
the
gap
between
german
and
yields
in
what
is
known
a
flattening
of
the
yield
curve
and
a
classic
sign
of
growth
