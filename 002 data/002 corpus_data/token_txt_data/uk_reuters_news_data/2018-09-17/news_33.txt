the
world
s
most
indebted
oil
company
is
on
course
to
reduce

by
the

of

despite
falling
short
of
its
billion
asset
sales
target
grisolia
told
reuters
in
an
interview
in
new
york
late
friday
the
firm
has
significantly
reduced
its
net
debt
from
the
billion
it
had
accumulated
in
to
finance
development
of
massive
deepwater
atlantic
oil
fields
then
petrobras
lost
investor
confidence
as
oil
prices
fell
a
corruption
scandal
engulfed
the
company
and
losses
from
government
fuel
subsidies
mounted
petrobras
aims
to
cut
net
debt
by
a
further
billion
in
to
reach
a
ratio
of
times
net
he
said
the
firm
will
continue
cutting
debt
until
the
ratio
hits
times
he
said
which
would
put
it
in
line
with
global
oil
majors
if
you
look
at
our
direct
competitors
and
peers
like
chevron
exxon
and
bp
we
need
to
look
for
a
more
light
capital
structure
grisolia
said
the
firm
should
reach
a
ratio
of
in
as
part
of
its
next
business
plan
he
said
although
that
would
depend
on
international
oil
prices
and
other
variables
such
as
foreign
exchange
rates
over
the
next
years
once
the
firm
had
achieved
debt
restructuring
targets
petrobras
may
consider
foreign
investments
to
facilitate
exports
of
rising
output
from
the
development
of
the
prolific
deepwater
fields
he
said
the
firm
may
invest
in
terminals
abroad
to
receive
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
he
said
that
would
help
brazil
export
more
gas
he
added
exxon
mobil
bp
and
royal
dutch
shell
are
among
firms
that
plan
to
invest
billions
of
dollars
in
developing
deepwater
brazilian
energy
reserves
in
coming
years
brazil
is
expected
to
account
for
a
large
share
of
the
rise
in
global
oil
and
gas
output
from
countries
oil
production
is
expected
to
rise
by
about
percent
next
year
from
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
grisolia
said
that
should
contribute
to
increased
revenue
he
added
crude
prices
rallied
to
year
highs
this
summer
as
global
supplies
tightened
leading
to
higher
fuel
prices
higher
oil
prices
than
the
company
estimated
in
its
budget
have
raised
revenue
and
allowed
petrobras
to
hit
its
debt
reduction
target
he
said
that
compensated
for
the
billion
from
asset
sales
that
petrobras
expected
to
receive
this
year
he
added
the
company
has
already
received
billion
from
sales
and
will
receiving
another
billion
before
the
end
of
the
year
he
said
all
the
divestment
and
cash
from
divestment
will
help
but
we
don
t
necessarily
need
them
to
achieve
the
target
of
billion
by
the
end
of
the
year
he
said
earlier
this
year
a
nationwide
truckers
protest
over
rising
diesel
prices
paralysed
latin
america
s
largest
economy
and
forced
the
government
to
lower
diesel
prices
through
tax
cuts
and
subsidies
that
hurt
petrobras
share
price
as
investors
worried
the
firm
would
again
lose
cash
to
subsidize
fuel
sales
the
firm
expected
to
receive
billion
reais
to
billion
reais
from
the
country
s
oil
regulator
within
two
weeks
to
compensate
for
subsidies
grisolia
said
subsidies
have
made
it
less
profitable
for
the
private
sector
to
import
diesel
he
said
but
some
imports
continued
and
he
did
not
foresee
any
fuel
shortages
although
the
volume
of
imports
to
brazil
is
lower
they
are
not
zero
they
are
he
added
we
do
recognise
that
margins
are
petrobras
is
running
refineries
close
to
maximum
capacity
and
importing
some
fuel
he
said
petrobras
has
a
gasoline
hedge
in
place
to
cushion
the
impact
of
fuel
price
volatility
and
is
considering
a
diesel
hedge
the
cost
of
the
hedge
was
marginal
grisolia
said
banks
that
petrobras
typically
works
with
for
currency
operations
were
executing
the
fuel
hedge
he
said
such
as
goldman
sachs
bank
of
america
bank
of
brazil
and
citibank
petrobras
has
hosted
meetings
with
economic
advisors
to
presidential
candidates
ahead
of
elections
next
month
grisolia
said
talks
had
been
positive
but
declined
to
say
which
teams
he
had
met
or
comment
on
their
strategies
candidates
have
different
plans
for
the
company
and
the
role
of
the
private
sector
in
energy
bringing
some
uncertainty
to
investors
