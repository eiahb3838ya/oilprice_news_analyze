pakistan
on
monday
increased
natural
gas
prices
by
up
to
percent
petroleum
minister
chaudhry
mohammad
sarwar
said
in
effect
slashing
consumer
subsidies
that
were
a
fiscal
drag
on
the
government
s
budget
sarwar
said
the
move
would
help
ease
part
of
the
billion
rupee
billion
deficit
for
sui
northern
and
sui
southern
the
two
main
suppliers
of
natural
gas
that
are
bleeding
cash
and
subsidising
consumers
and
industries
the
decision
was
taken
by
the
economic
coordination
committee
chaired
by
new
prime
minister
imran
khan
who
has
vowed
radical
economic
reforms
it
was
a
tough
decision
for
us
to
take
sarwar
said
adding
that
the
price
hike
was
to
percent
depending
on
how
much
gas
the
user
consumed
the
new
measures
would
inject
billion
rupees
to
stabilise
the
two
companies
sarwar
added
the
price
hike
is
some
way
off
the
percent
rise
recommended
by
pakistan
s
regulator
which
is
roughly
the
increase
needed
if
the
gas
providers
were
to
break
even
and
de
facto
subsidies
be
terminated
such
price
rises
are
politically
sensitive
in
pakistan
which
has
enjoyed
decades
of
cheap
gas
due
to
its
natural
resources
however
over
the
past
decade
those
gas
reserves
have
not
been
enough
and
pakistan
experienced
a
number
of
shortages
until
it
began
importing
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
which
is
more
expensive
than
domestic
gas
sarwar
said
pakistani
consumers
would
be
given
relief
via
a
reduction
in
most
taxes
on
lng
except
a
percent
sales
tax
pakistan
is
struggling
to
avert
a
currency
crisis
that
could
force
it
to
seek
a
bailout
from
the
international
monetary
fund
the
country
s
deficit
has
ballooned
in
recent
years
while
the
fiscal
deficit
has
shot
up
to
percent
of
the
economy
