update 1-shell targets lower methane emissions from oil and gas operations

royal
dutch
shell
announced
on
monday
plans
to
limit
leaks
of
methane
a
potent
greenhouse
gas
across
its
oil
and
gas
operations
as
it
tries
to
sharply
curb
carbon
emissions
shell
aims
to
maintain
methane
emissions
below
percent
of
its
total
oil
and
gas
production
by
it
said
in
a
statement
joining
british
rival
bp
which
last
year
set
a
similar
goal

mobil
announced
in

plans
to
reduce
methane
emissions
by
percent
by
methane
is
released
into
the
atmosphere
mostly
from
the
burning
of
excess
gas
known
as
flaring
as
well
as
through
leaks
in
gas
infrastructure
such
as
wells
pumps
and
pipelines
the
gas
has
a
bigger
greenhouse
impact
than
carbon
dioxide
even
though
the
oil
and
gas
industry
produces
less
methane
and
the
gas
also
has
a
shorter
lifetime
the
methane
target
will
be
measured
against
a
baseline
leak
rate
which
is
currently
estimated
at
range
from
percent
to
percent
across
the
company
s
oil
and
gas
assets
it
said
the
company
set
out
last
year
an
ambitious
plan
to
halve
its
carbon
emissions
by
far
exceeding
rivals
investors
have
called
on
the
company
to
set
binding
targets
to
reach
those
goals
climate
change
and
emissions
caused
by
burning
fossil
fuels
have
moved
to
the
forefront
of
discussions
between
energy
companies
and
investors
since
the
signing
of
the
paris
climate
agreement
that
seeks
to
curb
emissions
to
zero
by
the
end
of
the
century
in
order
to
limit
global
warming
the
race
to
methane
emissions
is
on

company
leadership
on
methane
does
not
stop
with
setting
targets

through
with

methane
emissions
reached
tonnes
last
year
accounting
for
around
percent
of
its
total
