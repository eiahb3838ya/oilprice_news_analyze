european

followed
asian

on

as
investors
took
fright
at
news
washington
was
set
to
announce
a
new
round
of
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
in
the
latest
escalation
of
their
trade
conflict
president
donald
trump
s
expected
announcement
of
new
tariffs
on
billion
in
chinese
goods
drew
an
immediate
threat
of
reprisals
from
beijing
the
trade
conflict
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
has
rattled
investors
who
fear
an
escalation
will
eventually
whack
global
growth
while
talks
between
the
two
countries
have
failed
to
make
much
headway
the
stoxx
index
fell
as
much
as
while
germany
s
dax
home
to
large
exporters
and
carmakers
dropped
half
a
percent
france
s
cac
and
britain
s
ftse
fell
percent
and
percent
respectively
europe
s
stoxx
had
last
week
enjoyed
its
best
weekly
gain
since
july
as
the
turkish
central
bank
s
interest
rate
rise
brought
a
broad
relief
rally
but
the
mood
was
less
buoyant
on
monday
however
after
the
initial
falls
there
were
signs
that
some
investors
were
ready
to
look
past
the
dispute
with
european
markets
reducing
their
losses
to
trade
close
to
flat
by

earlier
in

msci

three
straight

world
shares
remain
more
than

off
their
record
highs
touched
in
january
based
on
the

world
equity
index
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
on
the
chinese
side
trump
has
burned
a
lot
of
political
capital
so
it
s
hard
to
see
how
talks
can
resume
if
trump
goes
ahead

freya
beamish
chief
asia
economist
at
pantheon
macroeconomics
told
the
reuters
global
markets
forum
china
s
scope
to
retaliate
is
surprisingly
limited
however
especially
since
the
outbreak
of
swine
flu
which
will
anyway
push
up
cpi
inflation
beamish
said
referring
to
the
deadly
swine
fever
strain
that
is
seen
impacting
chinese
pork
prices
beamish
doubted
whether
the
united
states
would
slap
percent
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
imports
as
the
trump
administration
has
said
it
is
considering
and
the
wall
street
journal
reported
the
tariff
level
would
probably
be
about
percent
but
market
watchers
reckon
further
escalation
is
likely
china
may
potentially
pull
out
of
trade
talks
entirely
and
escalate
on
the
new
front
of
outright
export
restrictions
analysts
at
jpmorgan
told
clients
this
would
of
course
only
inflame
the
situation
in
currency
markets
the
dollar
succumbed
to
some
selling
pressure
with
the
greenback
index
down
percent
at
having
bounced
from
a
low

the
end
of
last

treasury

the

added

emerging

currencies

a

last

following
the

decision
to
sharply
raise
interest
rates
to
shore
up
confidence
in
