vienna
reuters
the
withdrawal
from
the
nuclear
deal
struck
between
iran
and
major
powers
is
doomed
to
seriously
affect
peace
and
security
in
the
middle
east
iran
s
atomic
chief
said
on
monday
president
donald
trump
announced
in
may
that
washington
was
pulling
out
of
the
deal
which
lifted
international
sanctions
against
tehran
in
exchange
for
restrictions
on
iran
s
nuclear
activities
many
fear
the
withdrawal
will
lead
to
the
deal
s
collapse
as
discerned
almost
unanimously
by
the
international
community
this
ominous
move
is
doomed
to
have
serious
repercussions
for
the
international
and
regional
peace
and
security
the
head
of
the
atomic
energy
organization
of
iran
ali
akbar
salehi
told
an
annual
nuclear
watchdog
meeting
salehi
a
veteran
negotiator
with
the
west
did
not
elaborate
on
what
those
repercussions
might
be
iranian
forces
are
fighting
in
support
of
president
bashar
s
government
in
syria
where
fighters
from
hezbollah
are
also
deployed
the
war
in
yemen
is
also
largely
seen
as
a
proxy
war
between
iran
and
ally
saudi
arabia
some
sanctions
lifted
under
the
deal
have
already
been
put
back
in
place
while
others
are
due
to
resume
in
november
european
powers
have
scrambled
to
protect
iranian
oil
revenues
and
shield
companies
from
the
measures
to
keep
them
operating
in
iran
but
many
firms
have
pulled
out
regardless
the
sanctions
have
contributed
to
a
slide
in
iran
s
currency
the
rial
which
has
lost
about
of
its
value
this
year
hitting
a
record
low
against
the
dollar
this
month
the
international
community
s
opposition
to
the
withdrawal
does
not
nearly
reflect
the
deep
anger
at
the
american
unilateralism
but
also
the
concerns
about
the
extremely
difficult
situation
in
our
immediate
region
with
all
its
pervasive
chaos
and
the
existing
menace
of
terrorism
