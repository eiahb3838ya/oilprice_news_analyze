hedge
fund
managers
have
remained
bullish
towards
brent
even
as
the
approach
of
hurricane
florence
turned
them
against
wti
and
refined
fuels
were
hit
by
liquidation
hedge
funds
and
other

managers
cut
their
combined
net
long
position
in
the
six
most
important
petroleum
futures
and
options
contracts
by
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
the
reduction
in
net
length
was
a
notable
reversal
after
portfolio
managers
had
boosted
their
bullish
position
by
a
total
of
million
barrels
over
the
two
previous
weeks
chartbook
for
the
third
week
running
fund
managers
added
to
their
net
long
position
in
brent
raising
it
by
another
million
barrels
last
week
and
by
a
total
of
million
since
but
that
was
more
than
offset
by
reductions
in

the
liquidation
of
wti
positions
is
likely
to
have
been
encouraged
by
the
approach
hurricane
florence
and
more
generally
by
the
peaking
of
the
tropical
cyclone
season
in
the
north
atlantic
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
florence
was
already
clearly
tracking
towards
the
atlantic
coast
an
area
of
net
petroleum
consumption
where
it
ultimately
made
landfall
rather
than
the
production
and
refining
centres
on
the
gulf
coast
however
concerns
about
the
risk
of
other
storms
coupled
with
memories
of
last
year
s
hurricane
harvey
which
put
multiple
refineries
out
of
action
for
several
weeks
in
appear
to
have
encouraged
caution
rising
inventories
of
both
gasoline
and
middle
distillates
after
an
unusually
long
and
heavy
summer
refining
season
have
inspired
a
similar
restraint
towards
fuels
in
contrast
sentiment
towards
brent
remained
positive
as
traders
focused
on
the
loss
of
exports
from
iran
as
a
result
of
sanctions
as
well
as
a
levelling
off
in
shale
production
and
strong
consumption
growth
fund
managers
have
become
more
cautious
towards
the
entire
petroleum
complex
since
the
first
quarter
reducing
gross
long
positions
across
the
six
contracts
to
just
billion
barrels
from
a
peak
of
billion
in
january
but
hedge
funds
short
positions
remain
close
to
lows
at
just
million
barrels
suggesting
few
managers
are
willing
to
bet
on
the
possibility
of
a
significant
pull
back
in
either
crude
or
fuel
prices
positioning
is
still
lopsided
with
fund
managers
holding
bullish
long
positions
for
every
bearish
short
position
down
from
a
ratio
of
almost
in
april
but
sharply
up
from
just
a
year
ago
overall
the
hedge
fund
community
is
still
anticipating
a
further
rise
in
oil
prices
even
as
they
touch
the
highest
level
for
almost
four
years
