clearing
houses
like
the
one
operated
by
nasdaq
are
vital
for
the

transactions
and
ensuring

finansinspektionen
the
swedish
financial
supervisory
authority
is
following
up
on
whether
nasdaq
clearing
has
acted
in
compliance
with
current
regulation
and
whether
the
regulation
is
sufficient
the
swedish
financial
markets
regulator
said
in
a
statement
late
on
friday
the
clearing
house
will
also
hire
an
external
party
to
review
its
handling
of
the
case
nasdaq
clearing
chief
executive
officer
julia
haglind
told
reuters
while
aas
had
bet
that
spreads
would
narrow
this
backfired
on
as
heavy
rain
pushed
down
prices
in
the
nordic
region
while
a
spike
in
the
cost
of
carbon
drove
up
german
prices
nasdaq
said
in
a
single
day
the
difference
between
nordic
and
german
power
prices
for
widened
by
euros
times
more
than
the
average
daily
move
and
exceeding
the
maximum
level
of
euros
for
which
nasdaq
clearing
s
risk
model
had
been
calibrated
since
when
the
current
pricing
system
was
set
up

nordic
power
prices
continued
to
fall
on
monday
due
to
wet
weather
and
lingering
concerns
about
the
default
said
lauri
riihimaki
a
trading
manager
at
finnish
energy
services
company
enegia
following
the
default
of
aas
nasdaq
s
clearing
house
on
friday
said
it
would
adjust
its
models
and
demand
bigger
capital
buffers
in
order
to
shift
more
of
the
risk
from
the
mutualized
default
fund
to
the
owners
of
individual
portfolios
the
fact
that
they
are
increasing
marginal
requirements
could
decrease

liquidity
investor

manager
maans
holmberg
at
finnish
power
firm
fortum
told
reuters
but
if
they
didn
t
increase
them
after
last
week
s
event
maybe
some
members
would
anyway
reduce
their
liquidity
as
they
may
be
worried
about
trading
safety
he
said
lower
liquidity
could
be
an
outcome
of
this
it
is
completely
logical
after
an
incident
like
this
it
is
normal
that
you
will
see
an
effect
on
liquidity
and
it
is
unfortunate
as
we
have
seen
liquidity
falling
over
the
years
he
added
nasdaq
on
friday
also
deposited
million
in
additional
funds
on
a
temporary
basis
to
help
restore
trust
in
the
market

aas
is
now
barred
from
trading
and
said
on

that
