britain
s
biggest
carmaker
jaguar
land
rover
said
it
will
go
down
to
a
week
at
its
castle
bromwich
plant
in
central
england
just
days
after
its
boss
warned
about
the
impact
of
brexit
and
diesel
policy
on
manufacturing
the
castle
bromwich
facility
will
operate
a
week
from
october
until
the
beginning
of
december
in
a
move
which
will
affect
around
staff
but
avoid
job
cuts
a
spokeswoman
said
in
light
of
the
continuing
headwinds
impacting
the
car
industry
we
are
making
some
temporary
adjustments
to
our
production
schedules
at
castle
bromwich
the
company
said
in
a
statement
last
week
the
firm
s
boss
ralf
speth
warned
that
the
wrong
brexit
deal
could
cost
tens
of
thousands
of
car
jobs
and
risks
production
at
the
firm
especially
if
there
are
delays
at
ports
and
on
motorways
due
to
customs
checks
he
also
said
that
the
government
had
demonized
diesel
cars
contributing
to
job
losses
at
the
company
earlier
this
year
conservative
lawmaker
and
brexit
supporter
bernard
jenkin
earlier
on
monday
accused
speth
of
making
it
up
when
asked
about
the
automotive
boss
s
comments
which
included
a
warning
that
it
was
already
more
attractive
to
build
cars
abroad
with
brexit
adding
uncertainty
the
unite
union
blamed
prime
minister
theresa
may
as
she
battles
to
convince
many
of
her
own
members
of
parliament
to
support
her
brexit
proposals
which
she
says
will
maintain
frictionless
trade
and
protect
jobs
but
have
angered
many
brexiteers
this
is
the
continuing
effect
of
the
chaotic
mismanagement
of
the
brexit
negotiations
by
the
government
which
has
created
uncertainty
across
the
uk
s
automotive
industry
and
the
manufacturing
sector
generally
said
assistant
general
secretary
tony
burke
a
slump
in
demand
for
diesel
cars
is
also
having
a
big
impact
on
the
firm
about
percent
of
jaguar
land
rover
s
jlr
sales
in
britain
are
diesel
models
which
compares
with
around
percent
globally
the
company
said
earlier
this
year
diesel
sales
have
fallen
this
year
nearly
percent
in
britain
europe
s
car
market
mirroring
similar
drops
in
other
major
markets
as
governments
crack
down
on
the
segment
in
the
wake
of
volkswagen
emissions
scandal
jlr
said
on
monday
it
was
investing
to
protect
its
plants
in
the
future
we
have
invested
more
than
since
to
future
proof
manufacturing
technologies
to
deliver
new
models
