south
african
power
utility
eskom
said
on
monday
that
it
had
fewer
than
days
of
coal
supplies
at
of
its
power
stations
posing
a
threat
to
national
power
supplies
a
company
spokesman
said
a
major
supplier
owned
by
the
gupta
family
had
cut
supplies
as
it
seeks
insolvency
protection
and
eskom
was
quickly
trying
to
secure
new
contracts
with
other
companies
to
ensure
it
had
enough
coal
eskom
is
critical
to
africa
s
most
industrialised
economy
as
it
supplies
more
than
percent
of
the
country
s
power
predominantly
by
burning
coal
it
is
also
one
of
south
africa
s
most
indebted
state
firms
out
of
our
power
stations
of
them
have
less
than
days
clearly
this
is
contrary
to
what
the
regulator
has
prescribed
eskom
spokesman
khulu
phasiwe
said
eskom
which
is
battling
to
recover
from
a
financial
and
leadership
crisis
said
it
will
transport
coal
from
other
power
stations
to
those
facing
constraints
and
is
in
discussions
with
coal
suppliers
to
secure
coal
contracts
if
there
is
no
coal
it
may
hamper
our
ability
going
forward
but
to
avoid
it
being
hampered
we
are
diverting
coal
from
other
power
stations
phasiwe
said
the
main
reason
for
the
coal
shortages
is
that
tegeta
exploration
and
resources
a
firm
owned
by
the
gupta
family
has
cut
supplies
to
eskom
as
it
seeks
insolvency
protection
