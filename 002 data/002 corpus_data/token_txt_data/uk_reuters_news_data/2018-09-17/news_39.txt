deadly
storm
florence
s
historic
rainfall
is
testing
the
best
efforts
by
many
north
carolina
cities
to
bolster
their
defenses
against
flooding
since
hurricane
matthew
inundated
the
eastern
part
of
the
state
two
years
ago
since
matthew
firefighters
have
been
trained
in
rapid
water
rescue
and
are
equipped
with
inflatable
boats
used
to
pluck
people
from
raging
rivers
and
streams
more
dams
have
been
built
on
many
of
the
rivers
that
snake
through
the
state
and
improved
forecasting
tools
have
made
it
easier
to
position
rescue
teams
in
the
city
of
lumberton
where
the
lumber
river
overflowed
its
banks
following
matthew
the
city
built
a
berm
an
earthen
wall
along
the
riverbank
to
contain
the
rising
current
and
prevent
a
repeat
of
the
flooding
the
berm
is
intended
to
supplement
a
recently
completed
dam
built
across
the
river
to
allow
for
a
controlled
release
of
the
water
flow
we
saw
what
was
coming
so
we
started
building
a
dam
to
keep
that
area
from
breaking
through
like
it
did
before
said
bill
french
director
of
emergency
services
for
lumberton
but
on
sunday
the
combination
of
the
dam
and
berm
failed
to
stop
the
swollen
river
from
climbing
beyond
its
banks
as
it
reached
about
feet
m
rising
feet
m
in
two
days
alone
it
could
get
worse
with
the
river
forecast
to
crest
at
feet
m
late
on
sunday
using
a
head
start
from
forecasting
of
the
rains
french
said
the
city
began
running
half
a
dozen
pumps
to
clear
water
from
drainage
canals
when
the
river
gets
as
high
as
it
is
now
you
re
kind
of
limited
in
what
you
can
do
he
said
overall
florence
a
onetime
hurricane
that
weakened
to
a
tropical
depression
by
sunday
is
forecast
to
douse
the
state
with
record
rainfall
from
a
single
storm
surpassing
the
inches
cm
that
hurricane
floyd
dropped
in
in
some
spots
in
the
offshore
outer
banks
islands
inches
cm
of
rain
were
recorded
this
weekend
warnings
in
goldsboro
west
of
fayetteville
retailers
have
moved
inventory
to
higher
shelves
learning
their
lesson
two
years
ago
when
matthew
s
floodwaters
damaged
goods
city
officials
have
gone
warning
some
residents
they
need
to
leave
similar
precautions
were
taken
in
wayne
county
on
the
banks
of
the
neuse
river
where
a
furniture
store
devastated
by
matthew
removed
all
its
heavy
merchandise
before
the
expected
storm
the
area
is
made
vulnerable
by
the
flat
landscape
said
scott
stevens
the
city
manager
in
goldsboro
a
foot
of
water
doesn
t
spread
out
a
foot
it
spreads
out
a
feet
he
said
rivers
may
fill
up
even
faster
now
that
soil
is
so
and
sodden
it
can
not
hold
more
water
said
drew
coleman
a
professor
of
geological
sciences
at
the
university
of
north
carolina
it
s
not
a
feasible
location
for
us
to
do
a
lot
of
flood
proofing
on
a
large
scale
said
stevens
the
goldsboro
city
manager
since
matthew
goldsboro
has
trained
firefighters
in
water
rescues
and
equipped
them
with
additional
boats
stevens
said
saying
the
city
was
much
better
prepared
with
equipment
and
training
to
help
federal
rescue
teams
were
also
positioned
before
the
rivers
could
rise
with
a
team
based
in
lincoln
nebraska
joining
efforts
in
fayetteville
to
make
sure
senior
citizens
were
safe
ahead
of
the
worst
of
the
flooding
more
than
people
were
evacuated
from
a
nursing
home
in
fayetteville
late
on
saturday
by
a
rescue
team
comprised
of
federal
responders
state
and
local
emergency
workers
said
maine
johnson
a
spokesman
for
the
city
of
fayetteville
the
worst
may
be
yet
to
come
said
evan
duffey
a
meteorologist
at
accuweather
in
state
college
pennsylvania
all
the
water
from
further
upstream
takes
a
little
while
to
get
down
to
the
cape
fear
river
with
a
normal
depth
of
just
feet
m
near
fayetteville
is
expected
to
crest
late
on
monday
at
feet
m
which
could
upend
life
in
the
city
of
about
people
still
recovering
from
a
costly
flood
in
the
aftermath
of
matthew
two
years
ago
in
towns
like
lumberton
which
lies
just
feet
m
above
sea
level
even
the
best
preparations
can
not
protect
the
entire
area
said
french
the
emergency
services
manager
there
are
some
areas
that
you
simply
can
t
do
anything
