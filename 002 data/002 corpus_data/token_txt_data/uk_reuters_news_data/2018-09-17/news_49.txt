president

is

to
announce
new

on
about
billion
of

as
early
as

a

official
told

the

level
will
probably
be
about

later

if
the

administration
moves
forward
with
the

other
officials

are
suggesting
china
impose
limits
on
the

restraints
to
threaten

chains
further
escalation
looks
very
likely
in

the
rate
will
likely
be
raised
to
percent
and
more
tariffs
threatened

china
may
potentially
pull
out
of

talks
entirely

escalate
on

new
front

outright
export
restrictions

this

situation
