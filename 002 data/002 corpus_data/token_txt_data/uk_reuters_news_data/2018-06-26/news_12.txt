reuters
a
federal
court
in
california
dismissed
climate
change
lawsuits
by
the
cities
of
san
francisco
and
oakland
against
five
oil
companies
saying
the
complaints
required
foreign
and
domestic
policy
decisions
that
were
outside
its
purview
san
francisco
and
oakland
sued
chevron
corp
exxon
mobil
corp
conocophillips
royal
dutch
shell
plc
and
bp
plc
last
year
seeking
an
abatement
fund
to
help
the
cities
address
flooding
they
said
was
a
result
of
climate
change
judge
william
alsup
of
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
said
in
the
ruling
that
the
dangers
raised
by
the
complainants
were
real
and
worldwide
and
both
parties
accepted
the
science
behind
global
warming
however
the
problem
deserves
a
solution
on
a
more
vast
scale
than
can
be
supplied
by
a
district
judge
or
jury
in
a
public
nuisance
case
judge
alsup
said
the
suit
was
one
of
several
filed
by
cities
and
local
governments
around
the
country
that
argued
in
part
the
production
of
fossil
fuels
had
led
to
rising
tides
that
damaged
shorelines
roads
and
other
properties
requiring
remediation
alsup
who
held
a
primer
on
climate
change
during
the
case
wrote
that
although
scientists
agree
burning
fossil
fuels
is
raising
ocean
levels
the
suits
could
interfere
with
reaching
a
worldwide
consensus
on
the
social
pros
and
cons
of
fuel
use
chevron
which
took
the
lead
in
fighting
the
case
called
the
decision
important
and
and
said
although
the
ruling
is
not
binding
on
other
courts
judges
in
similar
cases
should
follow
judge
alsup
s
lead
and
dismiss
their
cases
as
well
according
to
spokesman
sean
comey
richard
wiles
executive
director
of
the
center
for
climate
integrity
an
advocacy
group
that
supports
the
lawsuits
called
the
decision
disappointing
but
added
this
fight
is
just
getting
started
and
we
expect
to
a
shell
spokeswoman
said
the
company
regards
climate
change
to
be
a
complex
problem
which
is
not
an
issue
for
the
courts
but
requires
sound
government
policy
the
case
is
