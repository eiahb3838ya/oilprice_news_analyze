update 10-ge breakup leaves it with best and worst performers
reuters
general
electric
co
said
on
tuesday
it
will
spin
off
its
healthcare
business
and
divest
its
stake
in
firm
baker
hughes
effectively
breaking
up
the
conglomerate
which
was
once
the
most
valuable
corporation
and
a
global
symbol
of
american
business
power
the
company
will
focus
on
jet
engines
power
plants
and
renewable
energy
which
ge
hopes
will
reward
battered
shareholders
who
have
seen
the
stock
lose
more
than
half
its
value
over
the
past
years
this
is
really
the
culmination
of
years
of
observations
i
ve
had
about
the
company
said
chief
executive
john
flannery
a
ge
veteran
who
took
the
helm
in
august
with
a
mandate
to
revamp
the
company
flannery
s
comments
came
on
a
conference
call
with
investors
and
analysts
ge
said
its
plan
will
strengthen
its
balance
sheet
by
reducing
debt
building
up
cash
and
further
shrinking
ge
capital
shareholders
will
receive
percent
of
the
value
of
ge
healthcare
as
a
distribution
of
shares
ge
shares
jumped
percent
to
on
track
for
their
best
day
in
three
years
effective
tuesday
ge
was
kicked
out
of
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
the
iconic
stock
index
of
which
it
was
a
founding
member
in
the
company
will
spin
off
the
profitable
healthcare
unit
over
the
next
to
months
and
sell
its
baker
hughes
stake
over
two
to
three
years
ge
will
likely
either
need
to
hold
an
initial
public
offering
of
baker
hughes
organize
numerous
block
trades
of
shares
to
institutional
investors
or
find
an
entirely
new
investor
to
acquire
its
holding
since
the
only
two
strategic
buyers
of
its
stake
schlumberger
nv
and
halliburton
co
would
have
major
antitrust
risks
in
the
oilfield
services
market
analysts
said
in
an
interview
flannery
declined
to
rule
out
selling
healthcare
or
the
baker
hughes
stake
to
strategic
buyers
but
he
said
the
company
intended
to
have
them
both
trade
publicly
so
ge
shareholders
benefit
from
future
growth
the
decision
to
divest
does
not
mean
ge
dislikes
the
businesses
he
said
it
s
quite
the
opposite
we
re
trying
to
get
these
out
directly
into
our
shareholders
hands
and
in
an
environment
where
they
can
grow
more
ge
pledged
to
preserve
its
dividend
until
the
healthcare
unit
is
spun
off
partially
appeasing
investors
who
have
expressed
concerns
about
the
company
s
ability
to
pay
it
the
moves
which
end
a
strategic
review
mirror
changes
that
analysts
had
sought
a
year
ago
ge
said
its
plan
to
divest
billion
in
assets
is
substantially
complete
leaving
a
simpler
and
stronger
company
that
it
hopes
will
boost
growth
operating
profits
and
shareholder
returns
major
shareholder
trian
fund
management
supports
ge
s
plans
and
believes
that
the
initiatives
will
create
substantial
value
for
shareholders
it
said
in
a
statement
the
remaining
businesses
share
similar
technologies
and
industrial
markets
in
contrast
to
limited
synergies
that
exist
with
ge
healthcare
fitch
analyst
eric
ause
said
in
a
note
to
view
a
graphic
on
ge
market
capitalization
under
past
ceos
click
but
the
changes
leave
ge
with
some
of
its
and
units
aviation
has
been
highly
profitable
but
power
business
profit
has
tumbled
as
sales
of
plants
and
services
have
slowed
and
renewable
energy
profit
margins
are
less
than
percent
a
result
of
fierce
price
competition
flannery
said
in
the
interview
that
he
expected
electricity
generation
to
keep
rising
over
the
next
years
but
new
power
plant
sales
will
be
weak
and
frankly
we
re
planning
for
that
as
sort
of
indefinite
flannery
said
we
re
making
management
actions
now
premised
on
we
ve
got
to
live
in
that
world
he
said
if
it
changes
great
but
don
t
the
healthcare
unit
spinoff
follows
rival

medical
business

a
separate

in
march
on
monday
ge
said
it
agreed
to
sell
its
distributed
power
unit
for
billion
to
buyout
group
advent
ge
also
has
agreed
to
shed
its
transportation
unit
which
makes
railroad
locomotives
ge
bought
baker
hughes
in
and
combined
it
with
its
own
equipment
and
services
unit
to
create
a
new
company
in
which
ge
owns
percent
the
unit
reported
sales
of
billion
in
ge
estimated
restructuring
costs
at
between
million
and
billion
and
said
it
plans
to
reduce
industrial
net
debt
by
about
billion
by
and
maintain
more
than
billion
of
cash
on
its
balance
sheet
the
company
has
foundered
in
key
markets
in
recent
years
and
a
foray
into
financial
services
steered
it
into
the
eye
of
the
global
financial
crisis
in
ge
has
since
largely
divested
ge
capital
but
lingering
liabilities
forced
it
to
take
a
billion
charge
last
year
and
begin
setting
aside
billion
more
in
reserves
against
insurance
claims
former
ge
ceo
jeff
immelt
who
ran
the
company
for
years
from
shortly
before
the
attacks
to
last
summer
said
in
a
statement
that
important
elements
of
ge
s
history
would
continue
after
the
latest
batch
of
sales
are
done
ge
remains
a
formidable
company
