exclusive-trump's epa ignored energy department calls to limit biofuel waivers
new
york
reuters
the
trump
administration
s
environmental
protection
agency
has
consistently
ignored
recommendations
from
the
department
of
energy
to
reject
or
limit
waivers
to
oil
refiners
seeking
exemptions
from
nation
s
biofuels
law
according
to
five
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
the
renewable
fuel
standard
requires
the
firms
to
cover
costs
of
blending
ethanol
into
gasoline
but
the
epa
after
consulting
with
the
energy
department
can
exempt
small
refineries
in
cases
where
compliance
presents
a
disproportionate
economic
the
waivers
can
save
refiners
tens
or
even
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
a
year
under
epa
chief
scott
pruitt
an
appointee
of
president
donald
trump
the
agency
has
issued
more
than
two
dozen
such
exemptions
in
recent
months
about
triple
the
usual
number
granted
under
past
administrations
during
that
time
epa
has
consistently
granted
full
waivers
in
cases
where
the
energy
department
recommended
only
partial
exemptions
and
at
least
once
granted
a
full
approval
when
the
energy
department
advised
an
outright
rejection
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with
the
decisions
that
approach
marks
a
sharp
break
from
obama
administration
s
epa
which
had
often
either
adopted
energy
department
recommendations
or
when
it
didn
t
ruled
against
exempting
oil
refiners
the
sources
said
the
shift
between
the
democratic
and
republican
administrations
shows
how
political
ideologies
and
constituencies
can
steer
bureaucratic
interpretation
of
a
law
that
never
changed
with
major
impacts
on
industry
the
waivers
save
refineries
money
by
freeing
them
from
their
obligation
to
blend
ethanol
into
their
gasoline
or
to
purchase
compliance
credits
from
those
who
do
the
broad
use
of
waivers
lately
has
angered
the
powerful
corn
lobby
which
argues
they
threaten
corn
demand
the
renewable
fuels
association
which
represents
ethanol
makers
last
month
estimated
that
the
waivers
have
reduced
the
amount
of
ethanol
refiners
are
required
to
blend
by
billion
gallons
the
law
currently
requires
refiners
to
blend
billion
gallons
of
the
biofuel
per
year
the
surge
in
waivers
has
sent
the
price
of
biofuels
compliance
credits
to
lows
saving
refiners
such
as
valero
energy
corp
and
pbf
energy
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
until
now
it
was
not
known
if
the
epa
gave
the
waivers
on
the
basis
of
the
energy
department
recommendations
or
despite
them
the
epa
has
denied
public
records
requests
seeking
information
on
the
waivers
which
it
considers
proprietary
company
information
pruitt
has
misled
farmers
about
the
agency
s
relationship
with
the
energy
department
to
help
shield
himself
from
criticism
jon
doggett
said
executive
vice
president
of
the
national
corn
growers
association
actions
like
that
make
it
nearly
impossible
for
farmers
to
trust
anything
this
epa
has
to
say
dogget
said
in
a
statement
tuesday
biofuel
groups
have
asked
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
circuit
in
washington
to
review
legality
of
the
waivers
arguing
the
epa
is
methodically
destroying
the
demand
for
renewable
fuels
and
to
force
the
epa
to
disclose
them
epa
spokeswoman
molly
block
declined
to
comment
on
the
pending
litigation
or
on
whether
the
agency
has
approved
waivers
that
the
energy
department
recommended
rejecting
from
the
beginning
of
this
administration
we
have
worked
closely
with
our
partners
at
doe
on
this
issue
she
said
in
a
written
statement
doe
spokeswoman
shaylyn
hynes
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
during
a
recent
midwest
tour
pruitt
told
nebraska
farmers
that
the
epa
works
in
alliance
with
the
department
of
energy
to
grant
the
waivers
saying
there
was
just
one
example
of
disagreement
epa
spokespeople
have
repeatedly
said
the
agency
s
criteria
for
granting
waivers
have
not
changed
he
sat
in
our
conference
room
looked
us
in
the
eye
and
told
us
that
epa
doesn
t
approve
them
without
doe
s
recommendation
bill
pracht
a
farmer
and
ceo
of
east
kansas
said
in
a
statement
on
tuesday
now
we
know
that
just
isn
t
the
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
two
agencies
interactions
disputed
the
assertion
that
the
epa
and
doe
are
acting
as
partners
in
these
decisions
they
declined
to
provide
a
specific
number
of
cases
in
which
the
epa
has
gone
against
energy
department
recommendations
or
to
name
most
of
the
companies
involved
but
did
provide
two
examples
of
what
they
said
has
become
regular
practice
in
one
case
the
epa
provided
a
full
waiver
to
a
refiner
after
the
energy
department
had
recommended
rejecting
the
exemption
two
sources
told
reuters
in
another
the
epa
granted
full
waivers
to
refineries
owned
by
andeavor
a
large
refining
company
which
reported
billion
in
net
income
last
year
after
the
energy
department
had
recommended
a
exemption
according
to
two
other
sources
familiar
with
the
company
s
approval
the
waivers
for
andeavor
were
first
reported
by
reuters
in
april
the
company
said
in
a
may
earnings
statement
that
the
waivers
provided
to
its
smallest
refineries
saved
it
about
million
in
compliance
costs
scott
labelle
an
andeavor
spokesman
declined
to
comment
beyond
the
company
s
previous
statements
obama
s
administration
was
accused
of
being
too
stingy
with
the
waivers
last
year
an
appellate
judge
said
obama
s
epa
had
used
too
narrow
a
definition
of
financial
hardship
when
it
denied
sinclair
oil
waivers
for
its
wyoming
refineries
for
and
but
appellate
judges
in
two
other
similar
cases
upheld
the
epa
s
denials
and
its
methods
neither
the
rulings
nor
the
change
in
presidential
administrations
changed
the
way
energy
department
analysts
scored
applications
according
to
the
sources
energy
department
analysts
score
applications
on
a
test
that
considers
whether
compliance
would
lead
to
disproportionate
impact
or
threaten
a
refinery
s
viability
qualifying
under
either
leads
to
a
partial
exemption
qualifying
under
both
leads
to
a
full
exemption
the
epa
s
relaxed
standard
for
the
waivers
is
the
latest
illustration
of
the
agency
s
leadership
seeking
to
deliver
relief
to
refiners
from
the
law
which
was
signed
under
republican
president
george
bush
to
help
farmers
reduce
petroleum
imports
and
improve
air
quality
pruitt
has
repeatedly
recommended
overhauling
the
law
to
reduce
strain
on
refiners
and
advocated
for
changes
during
months
of
failed
negotiations
between
oil
and
corn
representatives
mediated
by
president
donald
trump
republican
senator
joni
ernst
from
iowa
the
top
state
said
pruitt
s
handling
of
the
waivers
appeared
to
be
based
on
a
political
goal
of
helping
the
oil
industry
a
charge
the
epa
has
denied
this
is
definitely
a
workaround
that
they
have
figured
out
that
s
why
we
are
demanding
transparency
ernst
said
in
an
interview
referring
to
requests
her
and
other
lawmakers
for
the
epa
to
disclose
information
on
the
waivers
the
current
administration
has
attempted
to
lower
compliance
costs
for
some
refiners
since
billionaire
investor
and
carl
icahn
first
raised
concerns
to
trump
during
his
campaign
and
then
again
after
trump
named
icahn
as
a
special
advisor
on
industry
regulation
after
his
election
icahn
resigned
from
his
advisory
post
in
august
under
pressure
from
lawmakers
who
said
his
dual
role
as
investor
and
advisor
posed
ethical
concerns
icahn
s
cvr
energy
was
among
the
refining
companies
that
received
a
waiver
from
epa
