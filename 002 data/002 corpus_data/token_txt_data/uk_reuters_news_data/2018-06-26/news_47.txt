update 1-iran says opec agreement did not specify oil production increase
london
reuters
iran
s
oil
minister
said
that
opec
s
oil
output
agreement
did
not
specify
a
production
increase
and
that
a
figure
of
barrels
per
day
bpd
was
an
interpretation
by
some
members
of
the
group
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
other
top
crude
producers
meeting
in
vienna
agreed
on
friday
to
raise
output
from
july
but
the
agreement
failed
to
announce
a
clear
target
for
the
output
increase
leaving
traders
guessing
how
much
more
opec
will
actually
pump
despite
what
some
members
say
about
opec
s
production
rise
of
around
barrels
per
day
there
is
no
figure
in
the
statement
bijan
zanganeh
was
quoted
as
saying
by
iran
s
oil
ministry
news
agency
shana
iran
s
suggestion
was
to
first
balance
oil
in
the
market
secure
members
percent
compliance
to
the
agreement
and
then
decide
on
a
production
increase
in
next
meeting
if
needed
zanganeh
said
he
said
that
iran
s
suggestion
was
approved
in
opec
s
last
summit
and
that
if
a
country
has
a
different
interpretation
of
this
agreement
iran
will
officially
raise
it
to
the
zanganeh
said
some
countries
want
to
send
positive
signals
to
the
market
or
to
the
united
states
but
that
is
not
related
to
opec
s
decision
the
united
states
china
and
india
had
urged
oil
producers
to
release
more
supply
to
prevent
an
oil
deficit
that
could
undermine
global
economic
growth
iran
opec
s
producer
had
demanded
opec
reject
calls
from
president
donald
trump
for
an
increase
in
oil
supply
arguing
that
he
had
contributed
to
a
recent
rise
in
prices
by
imposing
sanctions
on
iran
and
fellow
member
venezuela
market
watchers
expect
iran
s
oil
output
to
drop
by
a
third
by
the
end
of
that
means
the
country
has
little
to
gain
from
a
deal
to
raise
opec
output
unlike
saudi
arabia
