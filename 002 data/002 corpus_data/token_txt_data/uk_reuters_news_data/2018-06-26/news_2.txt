washington
june
reuters
israel
is
confident
a
second
auction
to
sell
rights
to
develop
offshore
natural
gas
will
be
more
successful
than
its
first
because
some
arab
countries
have
shown
they
are
open
to
importing
the
fuel
the
country
s
energy
minister
said
in
an
interview
on
tuesday
israel
which
discovered
it
has
large
reserves
of
natural
gas
offshore
in
will
hold
a
second
auction
in
october
or
november
offering
about
or
blocks
in
the
mediterranean
the
first
auction
held
last
year
only
got
bids
from
two
companies
as
some
oil
majors
were
concerned
about
a
backlash
from
arab
states
hostile
to
the
country
but
egypt
agreed
early
this
year
to
buy
billion
in
israeli
gas
and
yuval
steinitz
israel
s
energy
minister
is
confident
that
sale
and
another
one
to
jordan
will
help
the
auction
get
more
attention
this
year
egypt
and
jordan
are
the
only
two
arab
countries
that
have
treaties
with
israel
though
powerful
sunni
gulf
countries
like
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
do
not
recognize
israel
the
allies
do
have
a
shared
concern
over
iranian
influence
in
the
region
i
think
companies
were
skeptics
about
the
exporting
possibilities
of
israel
steinitz
told
reuters
in
an
interview
things
are
different
in
march
the
partners
in
israel
s
offshore
natural
gas
field
leviathan
its
largest
said
that
all
conditions
have
been
met
to
allow
the
supply
of
gas
to
jordan
s
power
generating
company
in
leviathan
s
partners
signed
a
billion
deal
to
supply
gas
to
jordan
subject
to
conditions
and
approvals
steinitz
met
with
five
energy
companies
this
week
in
part
to
spark
interest
in
the
auction
including
exxon
mobil
france
s
total
and
australia
s
woodside
energy
on
the
sidelines
of
the
world
gas
conference
held
in
washington
israel
could
offer
incentives
for
companies
interested
in
developing
its
offshore
gas
steinitz
said
companies
developing
small
to
fields
would
face
no
export
limits
he
said
companies
developing
larger
fields
would
have
some
export
limits
but
those
would
be
very
minimal
almost
insignificant
he
said
in
addition
some
companies
would
not
necessarily
have
to
link
up
with
the
israeli
natural
gas
transmission
system
and
would
have
the
option
to
pipe
gas
to
cyprus
or
egypt
or
build
a
floating
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
platform
he
said
israel
has
many
plans
for
its
gas
abundance
it
hopes
to
sell
more
to
egypt
where
the
fuel
could
be
converted
to
lng
for
export
and
to
build
pipelines
one
to
jordan
where
gas
could
be
sent
to
india
and
avoid
the
suez
canal
and
other
to
europe
israel
and
lebanon
meanwhile
have
been
struggling
to
overcome
a
dispute
over
exploration
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
the
government
has
been
trying
to
help
resolve
the
disagreement
by
participating
in
talks
steinitz
said
there
were
new
ideas
on
how
to
solve
the
issue
but
did
not
reveal
them
israel
would
like
to
help
bring
an
end
to
the
problem
but
it
is
more
urgent
for
lebanon
because
the
gas
would
help
its
economy
