continued

drag
brent

intermediate

up

traders

prices
were
mostly
driven
higher
by
uncertainty

libya
a
member

countries
opec
eastern
libyan
commander
khalifa
haftar
s
forces
have
handed
control
of
oil
ports
to
a
separate
national
oil
corporation
noc
based
in
the
east
of
the
country
the
official
oil
company
based
in
the
capital
tripoli
also
called
noc
will
not
be
allowed
to
handle
that
oil
anymore
he
said
in

later
confirmed
to

ahmed

spokesman
of
haftar
s
libya
national

said
on

that
no

would
be
allowed
to
dock
at
eastern
ports
without
permission
from
an
noc
entity
based
in
the
main
eastern
city

the
uncertainty
over
libya
s
oil
exports
came
after
opec
together
with
a
group
of
partners
including
top
producer
opec
announced
a
supply
rise
of
around
million
barrels
per
day

cooling
oil
markets
oil
markets
have
tightened
significantly
since
when
opec
and
its
partners
started
withholding
supply
to
prop
up
slumping
prices
at
the
time
despite
the
opec
agreement
last
week
we
believe
that
tight
supply
is
likely
to
drive
oil
prices
higher

said
in
a
note
we
expect
that
brent
prices
will
be
in
excess
