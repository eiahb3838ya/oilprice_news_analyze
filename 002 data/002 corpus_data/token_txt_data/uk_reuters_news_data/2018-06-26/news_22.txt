commissioners
on
a
minnesota
regulatory
board
questioned
crude
oil
demand
for
enbridge
inc
s
line
pipeline
on
tuesday
ahead
of
an
expected
decision
this
week
on
whether
work
can
proceed
on
a
proposed
expansion
of
the
line
enbridge
wants
to
replace
the
aging
pipeline
that
runs
from
alberta
to
wisconsin
but
it
needs
approval
from
the
minnesota
public
utilities
commission
which
must
decide
whether
the
project
is
needed
and
the
route
bottlenecks
in
alberta
have
steepened
a
price
discount
for
its
heavy
crude
this
year
line
placed
into
service
in
operates
at
half
its
capacity
due
to
integrity
concerns
its
replacement
would
allow
it
to
return
to
approved
capacity
of
barrels
per
day
commissioners
spent
part
of
the
morning
discussing
whether
the
project
is
necessary
commissioner
dan
lipschultz
said
he
felt
frustration
having
to
rely
on
forecasts
provided
by
enbridge
based
on
rising
oil
production
rather
than
on
refiners
demand
enbridge
lawyer
eric
swanson
noted
that
global
demand
is
growing
and
that
enbridge
apportions
demand
on
line
transporting
less
oil
than
shippers
request
we
think
it
shows
a
compelling
case
that
line
plus
the
expansion
will
be
fully
utilized
he
said
lipschultz
asked
swanson
whether
it
would
be
reasonable
to
approve
line
for
lesser
capacity
of
bpd
to
which
swanson
said
commissioner
matt
schuerger
said
data
for
state
refineries
suggest
little
idle
capacity
although
the
state
s
largest
refiner
flint
hills
resources
has
said
line
is
badly
needed
they
re
getting
oil
clearly
schuerger
said
the
oil
is
getting
to
market
somehow
replied
swanson
representing
enbridge
the
question
is
what
is
the
most
reliable
efficient
means
of
getting
it
environmental
groups
and
some
indigenous
communities
oppose
the
project
over
concerns
about
spills
and
damage
to
tribal
wild
rice
harvesting
areas
business
and
labor
groups
say
the
project
to
cost
billion
in
minnesota
would
create
jobs
and
tax
revenue
