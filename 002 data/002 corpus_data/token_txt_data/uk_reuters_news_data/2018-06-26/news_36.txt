london
reuters
uncertainty
over
brexit
has
halved
new
investment
in
the
british
car
industry
and
prime
minister
theresa
may
should
urgently
change
tack
to
keep
the
world
s
fifth
largest
economy
in
the
eu
s
customs
union
the
country
s
main
car
lobby
group
said
public
announcements
of
fresh
investments
into
new
plant
machinery
models
and
model
development
fell
to
million
pounds
million
between
january
and
june
down
from
million
pounds
in
the
first
half
of
there
is
growing
frustration
in
global
boardrooms
at
the
slow
pace
of
brexit
negotiations
said
mike
hawes
head
of
the
society
of
motor
manufacturers
and
traders
smmt
government
must
rethink
its
position
on
the
customs
union
hawes
said
referring
to
may
s
position
that
britain
will
leave
the
customs
union
which
groups
eu
members
in
a
area
where
there
is
a
common
import
tariff
for
goods
with
only
nine
months
left
until
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
eu
there
is
little
clarity
about
how
trade
will
flow
as
may
who
is
grappling
with
a
rebellion
in
her
party
is
still
trying
to
strike
a
deal
with
the
bloc
in
a
sign
of
just
how
worried
big
business
is
getting
siemens
airbus
and
bmw
have
publicly
cautioned
britain
in
the
past
week
that
their
businesses
will
be
hurt
by
a
disorderly
brexit
when
asked
about
business
worries
by
ambassadors
british
foreign
secretary
boris
johnson
was
reported
by
the
daily
telegraph
newspaper
to
have
quipped
business
a
spokesman
disputed
that
he
had
used
bad
language
under
the
current
timetable
both
london
and
brussels
hope
to
get
a
final
brexit
deal
in
october
to
give
enough
time
to
ratify
it
by
brexit
day
in
march
though
few
diplomats
expect
the
deal
to
be
struck
until
months
later
the
nature
of
the
future
relationship
with
the
world
s
biggest
trading
bloc
remains
unclear
and
there
is
deep
concern
in
boardrooms
about
the
prospect
of
britain
crashing
out
of
the
bloc
without
a
deal
or
with
a
deal
that
would
silt
up
the
arteries
of
trade
that
could
be
highly
damaging
for
an
industry
which
is
dependent
on
the
speedy
movement
of
huge
numbers
of
parts
across
borders
the
average
car
for
example
has
about
parts
bmw
s
mini
plant
in
oxford
brings
in
five
million
components
a
day
and
the
company
is
increasingly
frustrated
about
the
lack
of
clarity
around
how
it
will
be
able
to
do
that
in
future
the
car
manufacturer
s
uk
boss
ian
robertson
told
reuters
that
if
britain
tumbled
out
of
the
eu
without
a
deal
on
march
there
was
no
longer
enough
time
to
put
in
place
the
systems
to
ensure
components
could
keep
moving
easily
across
borders
what
we
are
asking
for
is
negotiations
to
take
place
decisions
to
be
made
clarity
to
be
achieved
and
then
we
can
plan
our
business
model
accordingly
robertson
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
smmt
conference
bmw
has
quietly
ramped
up
production
capacity
at
a
new
export
hub
for
the
mini
on
continental
europe
with
dutch
contract
manufacturer
vdl
nedcar
thereby
cutting
its
dependency
on
oxford
it
quadrupled
staffing
in
born
the
netherlands
where
the
mini
is
also
built
and
added
the
assembly
of
bmw
s
model
to
the
dutch
production
line
in
august
last
year
more
people
now
work
at
vdl
nedcar
than
bmw
employs
at
its
plant
in
oxford
even
a
small
increase
in
paperwork
or
customs
checks
after
brexit
for
example
could
lead
to
spiraling
costs
for
big
manufacturers
which
depend
on
vast
supply
chains
that
stretch
across
europe
and
the
globe
at
stake
is
the
future
of
one
of
britain
s
few
manufacturing
success
stories
since
the
a
car
industry
employing
over
people
and
generating
turnover
of
billion
much
of
the
industry
is
owned
by
foreign
companies
the
world
s
biggest
carmakers
including
toyota
bmw
and
ford
have
urged
britain
to
ensure
that
they
can
import
and
export
without
hindrance
after
brexit
one
british
manufacturer
is
mclaren
automotive
which
produces
about
cars
a
year
its
chief
executive
mike
flewitt
said
the
industry
needed
to
know
the
shape
of
the
new
trading
relationship
in
good
time
the
thing
we
plea
for
most
is
time
is
notice
flewitt
said
if
we
don
t
know
what
s
coming
then
we
just
run
into
a
brick
pain
supporters
of
brexit
admit
there
may
be
some
pain
for
britain
s
trillion
economy
but
that
it
will
prosper
when
cut
free
from
the
eu
which
they
cast
as
a
failing
experiment
in
european
integration
around
percent
of
britain
s
total
trillion
trade
in
goods
last
year
was
with
the
eu
so
may
wants
to
sign
a
free
trade
agreement
and
negotiate
an
as
yet
relatively
undefined
customs
arrangement
to
ensure
as
frictionless
trade
as
possible
smmt
chief
hawes
said
the
british
government
s
current
position
leaving
the
eu
single
market
and
the
customs
union
would
hurt
the
industry
the
current
position
with
conflicting
messages
and
red
lines
goes
directly
against
the
interests
of
the
uk
automotive
sector
which
has
thrived
on
single
market
and
customs
union
membership
