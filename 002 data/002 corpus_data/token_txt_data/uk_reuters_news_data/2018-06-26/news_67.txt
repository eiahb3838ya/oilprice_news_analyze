benghazi
reuters
eastern
libyan
commander
khalifa
haftar
s
forces
have
handed
control
of
oil
ports
to
a
national
oil
corporation
noc
based
in
the
east
a
spokesman
said
on
monday
a
move
the
internationally
recognised
noc
in
tripoli
dismissed
as
illegal
if
implemented
the
transfer
of
control
would
create
uncertainty
for
buyers
of
libyan
oil
who
normally
go
through
noc
tripoli
it
could
also
deepen
the
split
between
east
and
west
libya
which
have
been
home
to
rival
governments
since
in
comments
later
confirmed
to
reuters
ahmed
mismari
spokesman
of
haftar
s
libya
national
army
lna
said
on
television
that
no
tanker
would
be
allowed
to
dock
at
eastern
ports
without
permission
from
an
noc
entity
based
in
the
main
eastern
city
benghazi
mismari
said
the
move
was
to
prevent
oil
revenues
being
used
to
fund
militias
such
as
chadian
mercenaries
and
because
of
a
lack
of
recognition
from
the
chairman
of
noc
tripoli
mustafa
sanalla
for
the
sacrifices
of
lna
troops
guarding
the
ports
armed
forces
allied
to
ibrahim
jathran
a
faction
leader
briefly
seized
the
es
sider
and
ras
lanuf
oil
ports
this
month
until
the
lna
expelled
his
troops
last
week
the
lna
says
fighters
from
chad
helped
jathran
mismari
said
lna
soldiers
had
been
killed
and
dozens
of
others
wounded
in
five
attacks
on
the
ports
which
have
been
repeatedly
fought
over
by
rival
factions
when
asked
how
oil
exports
would
be
sold
in
the
future
via
the
east
he
referred
questions
to
noc
in
benghazi
which
is
not
recognised
abroad
faraj
said
head
of
the
benghazi
noc
said
his
office
was
planning
to
issue
instructions
to
oil
companies
to
start
work
we
are
legitimate
said
told
reuters
whoever
wants
to
do
business
with
us
is
noc
tripoli
said
in
a
statement
that
the
lna
had
decided
to
put
itself
above
the
law
and
any
attempts
by
parallel
institutions
to
export
oil
were
illegal
and
would
fail
as
they
had
failed
in
the
past
noc
warns
companies
against
entering
into
contracts
to
buy
oil
from
parallel
institutions
it
said
they
will
not
be
honoured
and
noc
will
pursue
legal
action
against
them
by
all
options
haftar
s
forces
control
most
of
eastern
libya
home
to
a
largely
powerless
parallel
government
central
bank
and
noc
entity
opposing
the
administration
in
the
capital
tripoli
eastern
factions
have
long
accused
the
central
bank
in
tripoli
of
misspending
oil
revenues
and
allocating
insufficient
funds
to
the
east
a
spokesman
for
the
eastern
government
said
its
prime
minister
and
central
bank
had
met
on
monday
to
discuss
how
to
start
managing
oil
revenues
the
eastern
government
tried
in
to
sell
oil
bypassing
noc
tripoli
but
did
not
find
buyers
banks
or
insurers
willing
to
take
the
legal
risk
western
powers
and
security
council
resolutions
have
protected
noc
tripoli
as
the
sole
body
that
can
market
and
sell
libyan
oil
the
fate
of
es
sider
and
ras
lanuf
two
of
libya
s
largest
ports
is
crucial
to
the
fragile
recovery
of
the
country

oil

their
closure
has
led
to
production
losses
of
up
to
barrels
per

of
a
little
over
