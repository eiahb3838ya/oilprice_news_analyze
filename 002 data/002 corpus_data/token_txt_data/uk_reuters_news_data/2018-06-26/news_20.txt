east
to
adhere
to
the
sanctions
which
are
aimed
at
pressuring
iran
to
negotiate
a
agreement
to
halt
its
nuclear
programs
iran
has
met
with
chinese
oil
buyers
to
ask
them
to
maintain
imports
of
its
oil
although
it
failed
to
secure
guarantees
from
china
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
in
may
we
will
be
engaging
in
the
next
segment
coming
up
in
a
week
or
so
with
our
middle
eastern
partners
to
ensure
the
global
supply
of

is
not
adversely
affected
by
these
sanctions
the

said
china
the
world
s
top
crude
oil
buyer
imported
around
barrels
a
day
on
average
from
iran
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
according
to
official
chinese
customs
data
equivalent
to
more
than
a
quarter
of
iran
s
total
exports
oil
analysts
said
there
are
concerns
that
opec
producers
will
not
be
able
to
fully
supply
the
market
after
iranian
oil
is
cut
from
the
market
there
is
real
concern
on
whether
the
opec
plus
will
have
enough
spare
capacity
to
balance
potential

european
powers
have
vowed
to
keep
the
deal
alive
without
the
united
states
by
trying
to
keep
iran
s
oil
and
investment
flowing
but
have
acknowledged
that
sanctions
would
make
it
difficult
to
give
tehran
guarantees
for
the
vast
majority
of
countries
they
are
willing
to
adhere
and
support
our
approach
to
this
because
they
also
view
iran
s
behavior
as
a
threat
the
official
added
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
on
tuesday
promised
iranians
the
government
would
be
able
to
handle
the
economic
pressure
of
new
sanctions

of
a
second

of

parts
of
tehran
s
grand
bazaar
were
on
strike
for
a
second
straight
day
reuters
was
not
immediately
able
to
confirm
the
report
washington
has
sought
to
emphasize
that
the
protests
are
part
of
rising
economic
discontent
in
iran
hoping
it
will
force
the
government
to
negotiate
a
new
nuclear
deal
to
avoid
sanctions
there
is
a
level
of
frustration
that
people
have
with
regard
to
the
regime
activity
and
behavior
the
enrichment
of
the
military
and
clerical
elite
and
the
squeezing
out
of
the
life
of
the
economy
the
senior
state
department
official
said
iranians
are
tired
of
this
situation
