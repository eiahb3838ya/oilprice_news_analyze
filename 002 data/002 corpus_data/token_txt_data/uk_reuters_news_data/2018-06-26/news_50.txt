china
will
become
the
world
s
top
importer
of
natural
gas
next
year
boosted
by
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
purchases
as
its
superpower
economy
grows
and
weans
itself
off
energy
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
tuesday
in
its
gas
annual
report
the
iea
said
chinese
demand
for
natural
gas
will
rise
by
almost
percent
between
and
to
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
including
a
rise
in
its
lng
imports
to
bcm
by
from
bcm
in
imports
of
lng
natural
gas
to
liquid
form
so
it
can
be
transported
around
the
world
on
vessels
will
rise
to
bcm
by
from
bcm
last
year
a
rise
of
bcm
including
china
s
bcm
growth
global
lng
exports
meanwhile
will
surge
percent
by
with
the
united
states
becoming
the
second
largest
supplier
in
the
world
compared
to
its
negligible
exports
last
year
thanks
to
the
shale
revolution
that
has
transformed
its
energy
markets
the
report
from
the
agency
highlights
the
might
the
two
powerhouses
have
over
global
energy
markets
just
as
president
donald
trump
squares
off
with
beijing
over
trade
china
threatened
tariffs
on
oil
and
gas
in
retaliation
to
taxes
imposed
by
washington
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
although
lng
was
not
included
in
that
threat
china
s
rise
to
the
top
spot
next
year
as
an
importer
of
both
piped
gas
and
lng
will
knock
japan
into
second
place
but
they
together
with
south
korea
continue
to
dominate
the
markets
china
japan
and
south
korea
imported
percent
of
the
bcm
of
lng
sold
last
year
and
will
buy
percent
of
the
bcm
of
lng
sold
in
when
all
of
asia
is
taken
into
account
lng
sales
there
will
rise
to
percent
of
all
lng
sold
globally
from
percent
last
year
the
demand
for
lng
in
the
top
three
asian
buyers
has
been
driven
by
policy
as
they
move
to
the
energy
source
from
power
plants
in
japan
the
fukushima
nuclear
disaster
accelerated
demand
after
nuclear
plants
went
off
line
in
other
asian
countries
such
as
indonesia
composed
of
hundreds
of
islands
gas
is
a
convenient
cleaner
and
cheaper
way
of
receiving
energy
than
constructing
pipelines
for
gas
or
using
petroleum
products
such
as
diesel
on
the
production
side
global
natural
gas
output
will
rise
percent
by
to
trillion
cubic
metres
tcm
with
the
united
states
contributing
by
far
the
largest
amount
to
growth
of
bcm
extra
gas
in
that
period
much
of
that
excess
gas
will
be
liquefied
into
lng
to
be
exported
making
the
united
states
the
second
largest
seller
of
lng
by
in
the
world
with
bcm
pushing
australia
into
third
place
with
bcm
and
biting
at
the
heels
of
qatar
as
the
top
exporter
at
bcm
lng
from
the
three
countries
will
account
for
percent
of
global
sales
of
bcm
