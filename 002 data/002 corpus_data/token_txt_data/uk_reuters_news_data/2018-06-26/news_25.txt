update 1-u.s. seeks to export its 'energy miracle' even as trade tensions mount
washington
reuters
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
wants
to
help
allies
replicate
the
natural
gas
and
oil
production
boom
by
exporting
american
energy
secretary
rick
perry
said
on
tuesday
even
as
trade
disputes
intensified
perry
said
the
surge
in
fossil
fuels
production
over
the
past
several
years
made
possible
by
advanced
hydraulic
fracturing
drilling
technology
had
helped
the
country
to
reduce
its
dependence
on
foreign
oil
and
improved
its
economy
we
are
bearing
witness
to
this
astonishing
energy
miracle
perry
said
at
the
opening
ceremony
of
the
triennial
world
gas
conference
but
this
is
not
just
about
exporting
our
energy
bounty
it
is
about
exporting
the
technology
the
that
unleashed
our
bounty
in
the
first
place
he
said
he
added
that
he
believed
replicating
the
production
boom
overseas
could
help
the
world
s
poor
to
access
affordable
electricity
and
that
boosting
the
share
of
natural
gas
in
the
mix
could
help
limit
greenhouse
gas
emissions
the
trump
administration
has
repeatedly
said
it
is
eager
to
expand
fossil
fuel
supplies
to
allies
through
supply
agreements
and
technology
sharing
but
the
task
could
become
more
complicated
as
it
imposes
steep
tariffs
on
steel
aluminum
and
other
imports
and
deals
with
retaliatory
measures
against
crops
motorcycles
and
other
products
including
petroleum
beijing
this
month
proposed
percent
retaliatory
tariffs
on
petroleum
imports
which
are
expected
to
dent
sales
to
the
shale
industry
s
largest
customer
and
further
pressure
american
firms
that
produce
gas
as
a
byproduct
of
oil
drilling
lng
imports
have
so
far
been
spared
but
the
industry
is
concerned
that
the
supercooled
gas
could
be
next
if
china
s
talks
with
washington
sour
that
would
be
particularly
bad
for
the
united
states
which
has
become
the
world
s
biggest
natural
gas
producer
one
of
the
top
crude
oil
producers
and
a
growing
exporter
of
both
since
last
year
the
administration
has
said
it
hopes
exporting
energy
and
related
technology
will
help
create
alternatives
to
geopolitical
rival
energy
producers
like
russia
while
also
forging
bonds
with
big
consumers
like
china
the
leaders
of
two
of
the
world
s
largest
energy
companies
said
they
were
worried
trade
tensions
could
destabilize
the
global
economy
hurting
hurt
overall
demand
for
energy
the
risk
of
trade
wars
starts
to
weigh
on
people
s
perception
of
economic
growth
in
the
future
chevron
chief
executive
mike
wirth
said
at
the
conference
these
things
run
the
risk
of
becoming
a
bit
of
drag
on
darren
woods
exxon
mobil
s
ceo
said
his
company
is
trying
to
keep
a
level
headed
voice
around
tariffs
but
that
protectionism
can
dent
investment
the
world
has
been
very
well
served
with
low
tariffs
and
free
trade
woods
said
with
tariffs
you
run
the
risk
of
making
some
projects
less
the
global
natural
gas
industry
is
currently
forecasting
rapid
growth
driven
by
production
from
the
fracking
boom
and
rising
demand
from
asia
but
to
capitalize
the
gas
industry
needs
to
invest
billions
of
dollars
in
new
lng
infrastructure
the
international
energy
agency
expects
global
gas
demand
to
grow
an
average
of
percent
per
year
over
the
next
five
years
with
chinese
consumption
leading
the
way
according
to
the
latest
forecast
released
tuesday
the
iea
said
the
global
gas
market
also
faces
the
challenge
of
cost
competitiveness
in
emerging
markets
and
said
the
industry
must
tamp
down
on
leaks
of
methane
one
of
the
most
potent
greenhouse
gases
gas
is
widely
viewed
as
one
of
the
cleanest
fossil
fuels
because
it
burns
more
efficiently
than
oil
or
coal
but
gas
can
be
lost
in
production
and
transport
the
conference
has
drawn
executives
from
global
energy
giants
like
exxon
bp
plc
and
total
along
with
senior
officials
from
the
state
department
s
energy
bureau
and
ministers
from
energy
producers
and
consumers
it
follows
last
week
s
opec
meetings
in
vienna
where
the
partner
countries
agreed
on
a
modest
increase
in
oil
production
from
next
month
following
calls
from
major
consumers
to
curb
rising
fuel
costs
