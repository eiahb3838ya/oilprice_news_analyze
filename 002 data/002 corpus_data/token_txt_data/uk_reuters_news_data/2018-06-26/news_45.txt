territory
a
percent
rise
from

left
them
down

a
threshold
that
defines

the

hovered
near
a
low
against
a
group
of
other
top
world
currencies
having
drifted
down
versus
the
euro
yen
and
pound

a
modest
uptick
in
bond

the

has
eased
but
it
is
certainly
not
the
last
storm

that
direction
said
societe

s
global
macro
strategist
kit
juckes
the
tense
atmosphere
also
kept
metals
on
the
defensive
as
financial
markets
worried
about
the
wider
global
economic
fallout
of
the
administration
s
america
first
agenda
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
had
ramped
up
the
rhetoric
again
on
monday
saying
on
twitter
that
restrictions
on
investing
in
tech
firms
would
apply
to
all
countries
that
are
trying
to
steal
our
wall
street
had
tumbled
with
the
s
p

nasdaq
suffering
their
steepest
losses
in
more
than
two
months
and
the
dow

closing
below
its
moving
average
for
the
first
time
since

the

albeit
in
smaller

the
seemingly

washington
s

to
protect
intellectual

is
an
issue
at
the
heart
of
a
trade
row
between
two
powers
battling
for

global
supremacy
wrote
yoshimasa
maruyama
chief

economist
at
smbc
nikko
securities
in
tokyo
it
s
turning
out
to
be
a
bearish
factor
for
the
financial
markets
as
the
united
states
is
unlikely
to
back
down

through
its
midterm
elections
in
november
another
sign
of
the
dust
gradually
settling
