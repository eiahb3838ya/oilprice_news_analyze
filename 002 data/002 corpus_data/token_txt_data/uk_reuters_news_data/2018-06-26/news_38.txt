palm oil ban likely to displace, not halt, biodiversity losses -study

a
ban
on
palm
oil
due
to
fears
it
may
cause
deforestation
could
displace
rather
than
halt
global
biodiversity
losses
as
it
would
likely
increase
output
of
other
oil
crops
to
meet
rising
vegetable
oil
demand
an
international
survey
showed
on
tuesday
palm
oil
has
been
at
the
heart
of
heated
debate
in
recent
years
notably
in
the
european
union
where
the
parliament
has
suggested
banning
its
use
in
transport
fuels
altogether
raising
outcry
in
top
world
producers
indonesia
and
malaysia
an
eu
deal
was
adopted
earlier
this
month
to
phase
out
of
its
use
by
the
report
released
by
the
international
union
for
conservation
of
nature
iucn
acknowledged
palm
oil
was
eating
into
tropical
forests
and
stressed
that
because
palm
trees
were
grown
in
the
tropics
its
production
could
have
catastrophic
effects
on
global
biodiversity
the
iucn
a
group
of
governments
conservation
organisations
and
scientists
said
palm
oil
production
was
threatening
over
species
with
orangutans
gibbons
and
tigers
among
those
suffering
severe
harm
areas
into
which
palm
oil
could
potentially
expand
are
home
to
more
than
half
of
the
world
s
threatened
mammals
and
almost
of
all
threatened
birds
the
report
found
but
if
other
oil
crops
which
require
up
to
nine
times
as
much
land
to
produce
than
palm
oil
were
to
replace
palm
oil
the
damage
could
shift
to
ecosystems
such
as
the
south
american
tropical
forests
and
savannahs
iucn
said
palm
oil
is
decimating
south
east
asia
s
rich
diversity
of
species
as
it
eats
into
swathes
of
tropical
forest
report
lead
author
and
chair
of
iucn
s
oil
palm
task
force
erik
meijaard
said
in
a
statement
but
if
it
is
replaced
by
much
larger
areas
of
rapeseed
soy
or
sunflower
fields
different
natural
ecosystems
and
species
may
the
report
was
released
on
the
sidelines
of
the
european
conference
of
the
roundtable
on
sustainable
palm
oil
rspo
in
paris
certified
palm
oil
had
so
far
proven
to
be
only
marginally
better
in
preventing
deforestation
than
its
equivalent
the
report
said
it
noted
however
that
the
approach
was
relatively
new
and
held
potential
for
improvement
the
organization
also
called
on
governments
to
protect
forests
in
all
vegetable
oil
producing
countries
and
limit
demand
for
uses
of
palm
oil
such
as
biofuels
the
iucn
report
comes
in
response
to
a
resolution
adopted
by
its
government
and
members
and
aims
to
provide
a
constructive
path
to
improving
sustainability
in
the
palm
oil
industry
it
said
it
only
looks
at
palm
oil
s
impacts
on
biodiversity
not
its
social
or
economic
impacts
which
should
be
addressed
next
year
