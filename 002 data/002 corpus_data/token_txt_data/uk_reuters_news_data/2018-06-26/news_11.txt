the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
on
tuesday
proposed
a
percent
increase
in
total
renewable
fuel
volume
requirements
for
next
year
sparking
criticism
from
some
ethanol
and
oil
groups
and
cheers
from
biodiesel
producers
below
are
comments
on
the
proposal
which
the
epa
is
required
to
finalize
by
advanced
biofuels
business
council
on
its
face
the
epa
proposal
is
promising
it
reverses
last
year
s
roll
back
of
cellulosic
biofuels
and
it
opens
growth
opportunities
for
advanced
producers
who
are
establishing
new
revenue
streams
for
rural
america
but
until
there
is
some
check
on
the
epa
s
abuse
of
waivers
regulatory
uncertainty
will
continue
to
threaten
investments
in
advanced
biofuels
said
brooke
coleman
executive
director
epa
made
the
right
call
in
not
reallocating
the
waived
small
refiner
exemption
volumes
however
the
agency
s
latest
proposal
for
is
yet
another
example
in
fact
it
s
an
annual
example
of
a
broken
government
program
that
needs
a
comprehensive
legislative
solution
that
includes
the
sunset
of
the
program
said
downstream
group
director
frank
macchiarola
the
rfs
is
a
policy
that
doesn
t
reflect
today
s
energy
market
realities
of
strong
domestic
energy
we
welcome
epa
s
decision
to
raise
the
advanced
and
cellulosic
biofuel
volumes
in
its
proposal
which
will
help
propel
the
industry
forward
in
however
the
advanced
biofuels
industry
is
still
suffering
the
effects
of
the
agency
s
decision
to
arbitrarily
limit
growth
for
low
carbon
biofuels
in
by
setting
a
backward
looking
rfs
requirement
the
volumes
should
be
higher
to
correct
from
last
year
and
also
spur
growth
for
the
coming
year
said
executive
vice
president
brent
erickson
joni
ernst
republican
senator
from
iowa
as
the
state
that
leads
the
nation
in
renewable
fuels
production
iowa
farmers
deserve
honesty
and
transparency
from
the
epa
on
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
the
proposed
uptick
in
the
amount
of
renewable
fuel
that
refiners
blend
into
transportation
fuel
is
encouraging
but
does
not
make
up
for
about
billion
gallons
lost
by
administrator
pruitt
s
decision
to
hand
out
an
unprecedented
number
of
small
refinery
growth
energy
the
epa
proposed
billion
gallons
for
conventional
biofuels
but
that
still
isn
t
a
real
number
we
can
count
on
this
plan
fails
to
ensure
those
gallons
will
in
fact
be
blended
by
neglecting
to
reallocate
gallons
lost
to
waivers
the
epa
is
doubling
down
on
another
year
of
an
estimated
billion
gallons
in
demand
destruction
said
chief
executive
officer
emily
skor
iowa
renewable
fuels
association
this
is
a
status
quo
proposal
for
ethanol
and
the
status
quo
is
bad
said
executive
director
monte
shaw
the
ethanol
number
isn
t
worth
the
paper
it
s
written
on
so
long
as
scott
pruitt
is
granting
small
refinery
exemptions
left
and
right
even
beyond
what
the
department
of
energy
national
biodiesel
board
we
welcome
the
administration
s
proposal
to
grow
the
biodiesel
volumes
following
two
flatlined
years
this
is
a
positive
signal
for
our
industry
and
we
re
pleased
the
epa
has
acknowledged
our
ability
to
produce
higher
volumes
we
ve
consistently
demonstrated
that
we
can
do
much
more
said
kurt
kovarik
vice
president
of
federal
affairs
it
is
promising
that
the
epa
is
planning
to
increase
the
volume
of
american
grown
and
produced
fuels
in
our
transportation
sector
however
the
proposal
does
not
do
enough
to
account
for
the
demand
destruction
of
over
a
billion
gallons
of
renewable
fuels
said
rob
larew
senior
vice
president
of
public
policy
and
communications
it
would
seem
a
hollow
and
cynical
exercise
to
praise
or
thank
epa
administrator
pruitt
for
appearing
to
follow
the
statute
with
this
proposed
rvo
said
president
and
ceo
bob
dinneen
while
we
acknowledge
that
the
implied
requirement
for
conventional
biofuels
like
corn
ethanol
should
in
theory
send
a
positive
signal
to
the
market
it
comes
with
the
backdrop
of
billion
gallons
of
demand
destructed
by
illegal
waivers
to
small
refineries
and
no
commitment
that
epa
is
changing
its
approach
to
granting
