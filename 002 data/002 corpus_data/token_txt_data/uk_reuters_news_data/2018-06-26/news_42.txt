nuclear
energy
will
remain
a
key
part
of
france
s
electricity
mix
french
finance
minister
bruno
le
maire
said
at
a
nuclear
conference
contradicting
environment
minister
nicolas
hulot
who
last
week
said
nuclear
was
leading
the
country
astray
le
maire
made
no
comments
about
ongoing
public
debates
on
the
share
of
nuclear
in
french
electricity
production
currently
at
percent
and
which
the
government
wants
cut
to
percent
by
but
he
told
an
audience
of
industry
executives
that
nuclear
was
here
to
stay
nuclear
energy
remain
essential
to
guarantee
france
s
competitiveness
security
and
energy
independence
over
the
long
term
we
can
be
proud
of
our
nuclear
industry
le
maire
said
at
the
world
nuclear
exhibition
in
paris
in
july
the
french
government
will
issue
a
first
draft
of
its
energy
programme
ppe
for
the
and
periods
with
a
final
version
due
by
the
the
text
will
outline
how
france
will
cut
the
share
of
nuclear
to
percent
and
increase
the
contribution
from
renewable
energy
we
will
diversify
the
french
energy
mix
by
boosting
renewable
energy
but
we
will
do
this
without
weakening
the
nuclear
sector
le
maire
said
adding
it
was
pointless
to
oppose
renewables
and
nuclear
on
thursday
hulot
number
three
in
the
french
government
and
one
of
france
s
most
popular
personalities
said
the
cost
of
nuclear
energy
keeps
going
up
while
the
cost
of
renewable
energy
is
falling
quickly
hulot
has
repeatedly
said
that
utility
edf
needs
to
close
several
of
its
nuclear
reactors
in
coming
years
in
order
to
reduce
the
share
of
nuclear
in
the
mix
but
edf
has
said
it
has
no
plans
to
close
any
nuclear
plants
before
other
than
the
ageing
fessenheim
plant
one
of
the
reasons
that
edf
is
in
difficulties
is
because
the
nuclear
industry
sorry
to
say
it
is
leading
us
astray
