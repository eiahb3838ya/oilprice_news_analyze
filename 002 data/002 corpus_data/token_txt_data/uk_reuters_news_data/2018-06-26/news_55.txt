refining
margins
the
benchmark
for
profitability
among
oil
processors
in
asia
fell
to
their
lowest
in
two
years
dragged
down
by
lower
gasoline
margins
as
refiners
have
ramped
up
output
after
completing
maintenance
and
as
china
stepped
up
exports
margins
at
a
typical
complex
refinery
in
singapore
dropped
to
a
barrel
at
the
market
close
on
monday
the
lowest
since
august
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
among
oil
products
gasoline
margins
fell
the
most
dropping
by
half
in
the
past
month
to
under
a
barrel
the
refining
margin
weakness
was
shared
globally
said
joe
willis
senior
research
analyst
at
wood
mackenzie
adding
that
the
consultancy
s
global
composite
margin
fell
to
a
barrel
during
the
week
of
june
well
below
the
average
of
almost
a
barrel
the
weakness
can
be
primarily
attributed
to
weaker
gasoline
cracks
higher
outright
crude
oil
prices
are
likely
to
result
in
slower
demand
growth
particularly
in
the
among
the
peak
demand
season
he
said
china
which
holds
the
most
refining
capacity
in
asia
increased
crude
throughput
during
the
first
five
months
of
by
percent
from
a
year
ago
to
a
record
with
the
bulk
of
the
increase
leading
to
a
boost
in
output
of
aviation
and
motor
fuel
similarly
refineries
in
japan
south
korea
and
singapore
are
also
ramping
up
output
after
completing
maintenance
earlier
in
the
second
quarter
asia
will
also
be
importing
a
record
million
barrels
of
crude
in
july
mainly
light
grades
that
could
further
lift
gasoline
and
naphtha
output
and
continue
to
weigh
on
refiners
profits
said
two
traders
that
participate
in
the
market
refineries
in
the
region
have
been
processing
lighter
crude
as
the
margins
for
naphtha
and
gasoline
have
been
quite
good
up
until
recently
said
a
crude
oil
trader
so
the
drop
in
margin
may
mean
a
switch
in
crude
or
yield
again
but
it
will
take
a
while
to
take
effect
the
refining
margins
are
getting
very
compressed
diesel
and
jet
fuel
margins
in
asia
have
also
slipped
to
their
lowest
since
november
as
refineries
increased
output
meanwhile
china
stepped
up
diesel
exports
as
domestic
demand
has
fallen
during
an
annual
fishing
ban
that
is
scheduled
to
run
until
three
middle
distillates
traders
said
chinese
exporters
are
also
focusing
on
selling
diesel
within
asia
as
the
economics
for
exporting
to
latin
america
are
no
longer
profitable
they
said
india
has
also
been
stepping
up
exports
of
diesel
in
the
spot
market
due
to
weaker
demand
in
the
domestic
sector
because
of
the
monsoon
season
which
typically
reduces
the
need
for
diesel
for
irrigation
pumps
two
traders
that
participate
in
the
market
said
even
with
the
drop
in
overall
margins
chinese
domestic
margins
remain
high
enough
to
support
refiners
maintaining
their
current
processing
rates
said
a
manager
from
petrochina
co
s
dalian
refinery
adding
the
plant
has
no
plans
to
cut
runs
japanese
domestic
margins
also
remain
firm
enough
to
support
runs
said
an
analyst
at
brokerage
in
the
country
who
asked
to
remain
unidentified
idemitsu
kosan
co
ltd
the
japanese
refiner
by
sales
said
on
tuesday
it
planned
to
raise
crude
throughput
in
the
third
quarter
by
percent
from
a
year
ago
