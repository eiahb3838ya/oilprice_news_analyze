israel
s
energy
minister
said
on
tuesday
after
meeting
trump
administration
officials
he
is
confident
that
the
united
states
will
not
relax
standards
in
any
nuclear
power
deal
it
agrees
with
saudi
arabia
israel
vehemently
opposes
any
effort
by
the
saudi
arabia
to
relax
gold
standard
limits
on
enriching
uranium
or
reprocessing
nuclear
fuel
in
any
deal
between
the
two
countries
yuval
steinitz
israel
s
energy
minister
told
reuters
in
an
interview
once
you
allow
one
country
to
enrich
uranium
or
reprocess
fuel
it
will
be
extremely
difficult
to
tell
other
countries
in
this
vicinity
or
elsewhere
in
the
world
not
to
do
so
he
said
steinitz
in
washington
for
the
world
gas
conference
met
this
week
with
people
in
the
trump
administration
about
saudi
arabia
s
quest
to
build
at
least
two
nuclear
power
stations
with
the
help
of
technology
he
did
not
identify
who
he
met
with
energy
secretary
rick
perry
has
been
working
with
saudi
arabia
on
a
civilian
nuclear
agreement
that
could
allow
the
kingdom
to
enrich
uranium
and
reprocess
plutonium
practices
that
advocates
worry
could
one
day
be
covertly
altered
to
produce
fissile
material
for
nuclear
weapons
the
energy
department
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
about
the
status
of
the
nuclear
power
talks
with
saudi
arabia
israel
and
saudi
arabia
do
not
have
diplomatic
relations
but
they
share
concern
about
iranian
influence
in
the
middle
east
if
the
united
states
allows
saudi
to
relax
the
standards
then
you
deteriorate
the
effort
so
i
am
confident
the
americans
would
listen
to
our
concern
steinitz
said
steinitz
said
it
would
support
saudi
arabia
s
development
of
nuclear
power
only
if
it
included
the
gold
standard
protections
and
if
the
kingdom
purchases
uranium
from
the
united
states
saudi
arabia
has
said
if
it
does
not
get
assistance
to
build
reactors
it
could
turn
to
other
international
partners
the
kingdom
is
also
in
talks
with
companies
from
russia
china
south
korea
and
other
countries
on
nuclear
power
