update 4-u.s. epa proposes higher 2019 biofuels mandate in line with expectations
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
on
tuesday
proposed
setting
a
blending
mandate
of
billion
gallons
for
under
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
percent
higher
from
this
year
s
and
in
line
with
expectations
the
agency
also
said
it
is
considering
a
number
of
measures
to
bring
some
transparency
to
the
compliance
credit
market
and
decided
against
forcing
large
refiners
to
blend
extra
volumes
to
compensate
for
the
hardship
waiver
exemptions
for
small
refineries
the
epa
s
decision
against
reallocating
exempt
volumes
drew
a
wave
of
criticism
from
biofuel
groups
and
their
legislative
backers
in
congress
but
was
applauded
by
the
oil
industry
the
latest
sign
in
the
growing
divide
between
the
rival
groups
the
blending
mandate
would
be
up
percent
from
a
requirement
of
billion
gallons
and
identical
to
figures
that
reuters
and
other
news
outlets
reported
last
week
the
epa
proposal
would
leave
the
target
for
conventional
biofuel
mostly
ethanol
at
billion
gallons
the
agency
said
the
agency
proposed
an
advanced
fuel
requirement
at
billion
gallons
for
and
a
biodiesel
mandate
of
billion
gallons
for
it
proposed
a
cellulosic
mandate
of
million
gallons
for
next
year
i
ve
traveled
to
numerous
states
and
heard
firsthand
about
the
importance
of
the
rfs
to
farmers
and
local
communities
across
the
country
epa
chief
scott
pruitt
said
in
a
statement
accompanying
the
release
mike
mcadams
president
of
the
advanced
biofuels
association
said
the
epa
proposal
recognizes
gains
in
the
production
of
alternatives
to
ethanol
he
said
additional
facilities
are
coming
online
and
the
higher
targets
will
help
ensure
markets
for
the
new
gallons
each
year
the
epa
must
set
annual
requirements
for
the
volume
of
renewable
fuels
that
oil
refiners
and
other
fuel
companies
must
blend
with
their
products
the
policy
has
been
a
source
of
contention
between
powerful
corn
and
oil
lobbies
in
washington
the
agency
also
has
the
power
to
exempt
smaller
refineries
from
the
blending
requirements
the
epa
under
pruitt
has
roughly
tripled
the
number
of
exemptions
granted
to
small
refiners
angering
midwest
farmers
and
their
legislative
backers
who
say
he
is
effectively
lowering
the
mandate
unless
he
forces
larger
refiners
to
make
up
the
difference
exemptions
representing
some
million
gallons
worth
of
biofuel
were
granted
for
and
according
to
the
epa
proposal
that
includes
waivers
covering
million
rins
in
the
epa
said
pruitt
was
considering
a
plan
to
shift
the
burden
to
larger
refineries
but
the
plan
was
scrapped
after
an
outcry
from
the
oil
industry
the
ethanol
number
isn
t
worth
the
paper
it
s
written
on
so
long
as
scott
pruitt
is
granting
small
refinery
exemptions

director
frank
macchiarola
said
the
epa
made
the
right
call
in
not
reallocating
the
waived
volumes
but
called
on
the
agency
to
embrace
much
needed
reforms
the
agency
s
latest
proposal
for
is
yet
another
example
in
fact
it
s
an
annual
example
of
a
broken
government
program
that
needs
a
comprehensive
legislative
solution
that
includes
the
sunset
of
the
program
