update 1-bmw talks up uk commitment but quietly expands dutch site
reuters
bmw
said
it
is
not
considering
moving
production
out
of
britain
because
of
brexit
although
the
carmaker
has
cut
its
dependence
on
its
oxford
car
plant
by
quietly
expanding
a
new
dutch
assembly
site
for
its
mini
brand
by
building
up
a
second
export
base
for
its
mini
brand
outside
of
britain
bmw
can
mitigate
any
damage
caused
by
a
possible
hard
exit
from
the
european
union
s
single
market
asked
whether
the
german
carmaker
was
actively
considering
moving
production
out
of
britain
due
to
uncertainty
over
future
trade
relationships
bmw
executive
ian
robertson
said
no
we
re
we
are
committed
to
our
operations
in
the
uk
our
workforce
here
the
german
carmaker
s
special
representative
for
britain
said
at
a
conference
on
tuesday
comments
published
in
the
financial
times
from
another
bmw
executive
on
monday
suggested
that
bmw
would
close
its
british
factories
which
make
mini
and
cars
if
brexit
leads
to
serious
supply
chain
disruption
robertson
said
those
comments
were
taken
out
of
context
and
referred
to
supply
chain
disruption
resulting
in
delays
to
production
at
factories
asked
about
the
impact
of
brexit
uncertainty
on
any
new
production
in
britain
robertson
said
there
were
no
investment
choices
to
be
made
on
that
front
in
our
cycle
we
are
in
an
enviable
place
because
we
took
a
lot
of
decisions
three
and
a
half
years
ago
and
as
a
result
we
don
t
need
to
make
any
decisions
right
now
he
said
on
the
sidelines
of
a
conference
in
london
britain
s
main
car
lobby
group
said
on
tuesday
that
a
lack
of
clarity
on
brexit
had
halved
new
investment
in
the
industry
and
urged
prime
minister
theresa
may
to
keep
the
world
s
fifth
largest
economy
in
the
eu
s
customs
union
bmw
has
spent
the
past
four
years
quietly
stepping
up
production
capacity
at
a
new
european
export
hub
for
the
mini
with
dutch
contract
manufacturer
vdl
nedcar
reducing
its
dependence
on
a
plant
in
oxford
central
england
at
vdl
nedcar
staffing
levels
have
jumped
to
about
today
from
around
last
year
and
in
vdl
said
vdl
declined
to
give
a
current
figure
for
vehicle
production
but
said
capacity
has
risen
beyond
vehicles
last
year
from
vehicles
in
the
numbers
at
vdl
nedcar
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
current
brexit
discussions
bmw
said
by
contrast
staffing
levels
at
bmw
s
british
plant
have
remained
relatively
stable
during
the
same
period
with
just
over
people
working
on
building
minis
in
oxford
the
plant
in
oxford
made
about
percent
of
the
mini
s
produced
last
year
bmw
said
vdl
s
staffing
levels
have
jumped
after
it
added
the
assembly
of
bmw
s
popular
model
to
the
dutch
production
line
in
august
last
year
in
addition
to
building
the
mini
hatch
mini
hybrid
and
mini
convertible
at
the
plant
in
the
southern
dutch
town
