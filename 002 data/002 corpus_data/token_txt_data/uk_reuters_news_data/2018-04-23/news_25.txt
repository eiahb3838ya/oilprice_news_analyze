russian
oil
pipeline
monopoly
transneft
has
rejected
a
proposal
from
its
rival

group
to
complete
a
deal
to
buy
a
novorossiysk
commercial
sea
port
ncsp
a

on

if

goes
ahead
it
will
allow
transneft
to
take
control
of

largest
port
operator
but
transneft
said
earlier
this
month
it
had
suspended
talks
on
the
deal
after
the
authorities
arrested
the
of
summa
ziyavudin
magomedov
on
charges
of
embezzling
more
than
million
magomedov
denied
the
charges
at
a
hearing
where
a
judge
ordered
that
he
be
held
in
custody
until
may
we
believe
it
is
inappropriate
to
complete
the
deal

into
account
the
circumstances
in
which
summa
has
found
itself

spokesman
igor
dyomin
told

move
to
acquire
control
in

was
initially
approved

regulator
the
potential
value
of
the
deal
has
not
been
disclosed
last
week
a
summa
representative
has
offered
to
complete
the
deal
on
ncsp
dyomin
told
reuters
dyomin
also
said
that
summa
had
told
transneft
that
russia
s
largest
oil
producer
rosneft
had
expressed
an
interest
in
summa
s
ncsp
stake
rosneft
denied
this
on
monday

have
not
and
are
not
going
to

with
individuals
who
are
under
investigation
