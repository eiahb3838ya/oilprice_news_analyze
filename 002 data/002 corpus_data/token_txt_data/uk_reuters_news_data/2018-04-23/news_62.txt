while
opposing
the
internationally
recognised
government
in

the
waha
concessions
granted
decades
ago
are
governed
by
a
law
that
stipulates
that
libya
s
oil
ministry
must
approve
the
deal
the
presidency
council
source
said
since
the
oil
ministry
is
not
currently
operational
that
power
falls
to
the
presidency
council
he
said
though
the
noc
has
previously
disputed
the
council
s
attempts
to
take
over

ministry
powers
