the

council

said
since
the
oil
ministry
is
not
currently
operational
that

falls
to
the

council
he
said
though
the
noc
has
previously
disputed
the
council
s
attempts
to
take
over
oil
ministry
powers
any
acquisition
should
deliver
the
best
possible
outcome
for
all
the
libyan
people
taking
into
account
libya
s
security
situation
fiscal
position
and
external

requirements
