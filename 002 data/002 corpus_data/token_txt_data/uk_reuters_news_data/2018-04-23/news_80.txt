the
panama
canal
may
carry
five
times
as
much
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
in
as
it
did
last
year
as
production
of
the
fuel
expands
in
the
united
states
and
asian
import
demand
rises
the
head
of
the
canal
s
governing
agency
told
reuters
lng
volumes
traversing
the
canal
could
hit
million
tonnes
a
year
before
the
end
of
said
jorge
quijano
who
leads
the
panama
canal
authority
up
from
million
tonnes
last
year
demand
for
lng
has
risen
significantly
in
the
last
three
years
as
the
increase
of
supply
especially
from
onshore
shale
fields
in
the
united
states
and
offshore
reserves
in
australia
has
made
it
more
competitive
many
countries
including
china
have
also
been
switching
to
gas
more
rapidly
than
expected
away
from
dirtier
coal
for
environmental
reasons
the
united
states
has
only
one
lng
export
facility
at
sabine
pass
in
louisiana
which
exports
via
the
panama
canal
mostly
to
north
asia
and
the
pacific
coast
of
latin
america
but
shipments
are
expected
to
surge
over
the
next
few
years
as
several
lng
projects
are
under
construction
with
total
capacity
slated
to
reach
nearly
million
tonnes
a
year
up
from
million
tonnes
in
right
now
on
average
we
re
running
six
lng
vessels
per
week
but
in
the
very
near
future
you
will
have
several
plants
exporting
and
that
starts
to
add
up
quijano
said
in
an
interview
with
reuters
on
thursday
lng
exports
through
the
canal
are
set
to
rise
to
as
much
as
million
tonnes
this
year
and
to
around
million
tonnes
in
he
said
reflecting
a
quickening
in
traffic
three
gas
tankers
transited
the
canal
in
a
single
day
for
the
first
time
on
april
and
since
june
there
have
been
days
in
which
two
lng
ships
passed
through
the
canal
in
a
period
shipments
of
lng
through
the
panama
canal
began
to
rise
after
a
third
set
of
locks
was
added
in
quijano
said
and
the
authority
projects
growing
demand
for
the
supercooled
fuel
will
boost
such
transits
through
the
early
part
of
the
the
canal
is
already
looking
beyond
the
next
few
years
to
adding
a
fourth
set
of
locks
which
would
serve
a
new
generation
of
even
bigger
ships
