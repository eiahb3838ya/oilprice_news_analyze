s
president
nicolas
maduro
kicked
off
his
presidential
campaign
giving
away
trash
trucks
and
tractors
while
challenger
henri
falcon
laid
out
plans
to
state
oil
company
pdvsa
and
dollarise
an
ailing
economy
turnout
at
the
may
election
is
expected
to
be
low
given
venezuelans
depression
over
an
unprecedented
economic
meltdown
and
a
boycott
by
the
mainstream
opposition
which
views
the
poll
as
a
farce
intended
to
legitimize
autocracy
though
some
polls
have
put
him
level
or
even
ahead
of
maduro
abstention
would
hit
the
former
soldier
and
governor
falcon
harder
than
the
socialist
incumbent
more
than
executives
at
pdvsa
or
petr√≥leos
de
venezuela
and
its
suppliers
have
been
jailed
in
recent
months
for
alleged
corruption
tensions
between
pdvsa
which
provides
venezuela
with
some
percent
of
export
revenue
and
foreign
oil
companies
has
risen
as
military
officers
who
have
little
or
no
oil
industry
experience
are
given
senior
roles
falcon
and
wall
street
heavyweight
francisco
rodriguez
his
chief
economic
adviser
laid
out
plans
to
reform
pdvsa
separating
it
from
the
oil
ministry
asking
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
to
raise
quotas
and
strengthening
the
role
of
foreign
partners
underlining
the
difficulty
of
falcon
s
task
other
opposition
activists
were
organising
rallies
this
week
to
promote
abstention
at
next
month
s
vote
unlike
past
campaigns
rallies
on
both
sides
have
so
far
been
poorly
attended
there
are
many
difficulties
yes
but
who
is
going
to
overcome
them
the
oligarchy
donald
trump
or
us
said
maduro
speaking
in
the
city
of
san
felix
in
the
southern
state
of
bolivar
where
he
gave
vehicles
to
local
authorities
maduro
the
successor
to
hugo
chavez
has
roughly
percent
core
support
and
is
expected
to
win
given
the
state
s
formidable
election
apparatus
a
political
ban
on
the
opposition
s
two
top
leaders
a
compliant
election
board
and
the
poor
s
dependence
on
welfare
policies
including
food
handouts
millions
earn
the
equivalent
of
barely
a
month
suffer
shortages
of
basic
food
and
medicine
and
face
annual
inflation
in
the
thousands
of
percent
falcon
described
the
crisis
as
the
worst
in
latin
american
history
as
he
was
flanked
by
rodriguez
the
pair
plan
to
dollarise
venezuela
s
economy
replacing
the
bolivar
which
has
weakened
over
percent
against
the
dollar
since
maduro
came
to
power
some
independent
economists
however
see
that
as
unfeasible
hunger
is
venezuelans
biggest
problem
falcon
said
lambasting
maduro
for
incompetence
various
foreign
government
have
threatened
to
not
recognise
may
s
election
given
democratic
shortcomings
and
the
united
states
is
considering
oil
sanctions
against
venezuela
afterwards
venezuela
doesn
t
work
and
that
s
what
we
want
to
change
