with

from

on
the
economic
front
a
global
round
of
economic
surveys
should
show
if
economic
softness
in
the
first
quarter
was
a
passing
phase
linked
to
wintry
weather
and
lunar
new

holidays
in

readings
from
japan
france
and
germany
were
all
relatively
reassuring
it
s
a

it
s
still
encouraging

he
said
pointed

talk
of

by
the

steven
mnuchin
to

also
fuelled
hopes
that
trade
tensions
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
may
be
thawing
but
the
rise
in
bond
yields
overshadowed
these
positives

all

include

years
of
the

expectations
according
to
thomson

fears
are
the
rise
in

yields
could
further
derail
world
stocks
which
stand
some
percent
off
peaks
when

neared
the

mark
in

rocked
risk
appetite
and
sent
stocks
sliding
it
also
came
shortly
before

s

price
tumble
another
increase
in

will
be
enough
for
yields
to
threaten
percent
oil
is
now
at
the
cusp
of
levels
where
higher
prices
will
spark
greater
currency
and
broader
asset
market
volatility
said
deutsche

s
macro
strategist
alan
ruskin
while
the
dollar
traditionally
has
a
slight
negative
correlation
with
oil
ruskin
said
higher
yields
would
be
mildly
indeed
dealers
cited
yield
differentials
for
the
dollar
s
latest
rally
as
the
gap
with
german
bonds
touched
the
widest
in
almost
three
decades
the
greenback
rose
strongly
against
the
yen
and
euro
the
latter
slumped
percent
to
the
weakest
since
weighed
down
also
by
easing
risks
around
north
korea
the
euro
too
fell
half
a

to
around
it
could
gain
direction
from
the
european
central

meeting
on
thursday
especially
if

signal
it
may
be
too
early
to
announce
a
timetable
