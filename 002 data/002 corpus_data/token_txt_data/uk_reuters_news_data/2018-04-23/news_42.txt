increases

iraq
decided

prices
to
crash
in

baghdad
s
ability

the
kurdistan
regional

produces
oil

from
fields
it
controls
in
northern
iraq
under
a
model
that
is
more
profitable
to
companies
the
new
contracts
offered
by
baghdad
will
also
set
a
time
limit
for
companies
to
end
gas
flaring
from
oilfields
they
develop
iraq
continues
to
flare
some
of
the
gas
extracted
alongside
crude
oil
at
its
fields
because
it
lacks
the
facilities
to
process
it
into
fuel
iraq
hopes
to
end
gas
flaring
by
flaring
costs
the
government
nearly
billion
in
lost
revenue
each
year
and
could
meet
most
of
its
unmet
needs
for
power
