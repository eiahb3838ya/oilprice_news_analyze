uzbekistan
plans
to
join
an
billion
project
to
build
a
natural
gas
pipeline
from
turkmenistan
to
india
uzbek
president
shavkat
mirziyoyev
said
on
monday
although
it
was
unclear
whether
tashkent
might
eventually
ship
gas
through
it
turkmenistan
which
sits
on
the
world
s
gas
reserves
and
borders
afghanistan
started
this
year
laying
the
afghan
section
of
the
pipeline
which
will
also
cross
pakistan
seeing
it
as
key
to
diversifying
exports
away
from
china
uzbekistan
also
exports
gas
mainly
to
china
and
russia
although
its
export
volumes
are
much
lower
than
the
turkmen
ones
due
to
higher
domestic
consumption
we
have
agreed
that
uzbekistan
will
also
take
part
in
this
project
mirziyoyev
told
reporters
after
meeting
his
turkmen
counterpart
kurbanguly
berdymukhamedov
who
visited
uzbekistan
he
provided
no
details
but
said
uzbek
experts
would
travel
to
turkmenistan
to
discuss
tashkent
s
role
in
the
pipeline
turkmenistan
and
uzbekistan
both
central
asian
republics
each
produce
more
than
billion
cubic
metres
of
gas
a
year
china
dominates
turkmen
exports
while
uzbek
gas
sales
are
split
roughly
equally
between
china
and
russia
