trump's revenge: u.s. oil floods europe, hurting opec and russia
reuters
as
opec
s
efforts
to
balance
the
oil
market
bear
fruit
producers
are
reaping
the
benefits
and
flooding
europe
with
a
record
amount
of
crude
russia
paired
with
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
last
year
in
cutting
oil
output
jointly
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
a
deal
they
say
has
largely
rebalanced
the
market
and
one
that
has
helped
elevate
benchmark
brent
prices
close
to
highs
now
the
relatively
high
prices
brought
about
by
that
pact
coupled
with
surging
output
are
making
it
harder
to
sell
russian
nigerian
and
other
oil
grades
in
europe
traders
said
oil
is
on
offer
everywhere
said
a
trader
with
a
mediterranean
refiner
who
regularly
buys
russian
and
caspian
sea
crude
and
has
recently
started
purchasing
oil
it
puts
local
grades
under
a
lot
of
oil
output
is
expected
to
hit
million
bpd
this
year
rivaling
that
of
top
producers
russia
and
saudi
arabia
in
april
supplies
to
europe
are
set
to
reach
an
high
of
roughly

crude

in

jumped
to
million

large
aframax

according
to
the
same
data
trade
sources
said
flows
to
europe
would
keep
rising
with
barrels
increasingly
finding
homes
in
foreign
refineries
often
at
the
expense
of
oil
from
opec
or
russia
in
europe
took
roughly
percent
of
crude
exports
reuters
data
showed
but
the
proportion
has
already
risen
to
roughly
percent
this
year
top

include

david

of

consultancy
said
there
are
a
number
of
customers
who
still
may
test

wech
said
the
gains
for
suppliers
could
come
as
a
welcome
development
for
president
donald
trump
who
accused
opec
on
friday
of
artificially
boosting
oil
prices
looks
like
opec
is
at
it
again
with
record
amounts
of
oil
all
over
the
place
including
the
fully
loaded
ships
at
sea
oil
prices
are
artificially
very
high
no
good
and
will
not
be
accepted
trump
wrote
on
twitter
while
the
united
states
lifted
its
oil
export
ban
in
late
the
move
took
time
to
gain
traction
among
europe
s
traditional
refineries
which
were
slow
to
diversify
away
from
crude
from
the
north
sea
west
africa
and
the
caspian
european
refiners
started
experimenting
with
crude
last
year
said
ehsan
director
of
consultancy
resource
economics
now
they
know
more
than
enough
to
process
this
oil
gained
in
popularity
sources
said
in
part
because
of
the
wide
gap
between
west
texas
intermediate
the
benchmark
and
dated
brent
which
is
more
expensive
and
sets
the
price
for
most
of
the
world
s
crude
grades
this
gap
known
as
the
spread
has
averaged
per
barrel
this
year
nearly
twice
as
high
as
the
figure
reuters
data
showed
wech
of
jbc
energy
said
the
spread
would
likely
persist
in
the
near
future
the
most
popular

in

are
wti
light
louisiana
sweet

ford
bakken
and
