canadian

hundreds
of

the

to
pipelines
and

cars

south
and
west
trucks
loaded
with
crude
are
an
increasingly
common
sight
at
the
border
production
has
risen
in
the
world
s
fifth
largest
producer
but
full
pipelines
and
a
rail
car
shortage
have
made
it
difficult
for
drillers
to
ship
oil
out
of
canada
some
oil
producers
are
feeling
the
pressure
from
customers
gear
energy
ltd
pumps
about
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
and
recently
had
an
asian
customer
walk
away
from
an
agreement
to
buy
crude
after
failing
to
secure
a
way
to
ship
oil
to
the
west
coast
we
ve
never
had
more
inbound
calls
looking
for
heavy
oil
said

we
have
never
had
more
challenges
actually
getting
it
to

it

very
production
in
canada
rose
percent
in
the
last
year
to
a
record
million
barrels
per
day

and
is
forecast
to
keep
rising
over
the
next
five
years
opec
production
is
expected
to
only
grow
modestly
leaving
the
bulk
of
forecasted
global
supply
increases
to
the
united
states
and
canada
but
canada
s
oil
industry
faces
significant
challenges
not
the
least
of
which
are
high
production
costs
remote
oil
fields
and
perhaps
most
pressing
the
shipping
bottlenecks
so
significant
are
the
problems
that
a
number
of
oil
majors
have
withdrawn
from
canada
no
easy
solution
is
on
the
horizon
plans
for
new
export
pipelines
are
running
into
opposition
from
environmentalists
aboriginal
groups
and
rival
provinces
most
recently
kinder

canada
hit
the
brakes
on
its
trans
mountain
expansion
and
transcanada
corp
has
not
yet
fully
committed
to
its
keystone
xl
project
frustrated
and
fearful
of
missing
out
on
the
rebound
in
prices
drillers
are
increasingly
relying
on
trucks
to
move
oil
to
the
market
crude
exports
from
canada
by
road
nearly
tripled
from
to
and
continued
to
rise
in
the
first
two
months
of
according
to
statscan
data
provided
to

for
graphic
see
however
a
truck
can
only
carry
barrels
of
oil
compared
with
barrels
in
one
unit
train
or
nearly
per
day
on
the
keystone
pipeline
the
equivalent
of
trucks
each
one
of
those
trucks
needs
a
driver
and
enough
fuel
to
carry
crude
over
long
distances
moving
crude
by
truck
is
at
least
times
more
expensive
on
a
basis
compared
with
rail
or
pipeline
we
have
demand
for
bpd
and
we
can
move
about
a
fifth

rising
opposition
to

hitting
alberta
the
landlocked
province
where
most
canadian
oil
is
produced
the
fight
over
the

expansion
which
would
nearly
triple
the

to
a
british

has
engulfed
two
provinces
and
the
government
of
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
british
columbia
is
opposed
to
the
project
which
prompted
kinder
morgan
to
suspend
work
on
the
line
alberta
s
premier
threatened
to
cut
fuel
deliveries
to
its
neighbouring
province
in
retaliation
as
for
trains
during
certain
months
rail
operators
face
political
pressure
to
prioritize
movement
of
agricultural
products
rail
operators
want
deals
from
shippers
but
oil
companies
prefer
to
have
the
flexibility
to
shift
to
pipelines
if
space
becomes
available
exports
by
road
rose
from
just
over
barrels
per
month
in
to
more
than
in
according
to
data
statistics
canada
provided
to
reuters
in
the
first
two
months
of
road
exports
surged
to
an
average
of
a
month
by
contrast
rail
exports
averaged
million
barrels
a
month
in
using
trucks
allows
producers
to
reach
northern
rail
loading
sites
where
there
is
more
capacity
and
rates
are
cheaper
zielinski
said
monthly
demand
fluctuates
based
on
the
discount
for
western
canadian
crude
versus
the
benchmark
when
the
discount
is
above
oil
producers
will
pay
to
haul
crude
up
to
five
hours
more
than
twice
as
far
as
usually
makes
economic
sense
zielinski
said
however
the
trucking
industry
s
capacity
to
move
more
crude
is
limited
by
a
severe
driver
shortage
in
western
canada
said
andrew
barnes
director
of
compliance
and
regulatory
affairs
at
alberta
motor
transportation
association
this
is
not
unique
to
canada
booming
production
in
west
texas
has
strained
pipeline
capacity
increasing
reliance
on
trucks
to
deliver
to
injection
points
but
ongoing
pipeline
construction
in
texas
should
alleviate
the
glut
in
the
next
year
while
canada
s
future
in
less
clear
the
uptick
in
truck
transport
also
raises
safety
questions
there
were
road
accidents
involving
crude
tanker
trucks
in
canada
from
through
which
killed
people
according
to
transport
canada
data
there
were
nine
accidents
involving
crude
trains
though
one
was
the
lac
megantic
quebec
disaster
in
where
a
train
hauling
cars
derailed
and
exploded
killing
when
the
canadian
oil
discount
hit
a
high
at
in
january
alberta
oil
companies
started
calling
ceres
global
ag
corp
a
grain
and
fertilizer
handling
facility
on
the
border
at
northgate
saskatchewan
desperate
for
access
companies
were
pushing
ceres
to
accelerate
plans
to
add
crude
hauling
starting
with
a
c
million
million
facility
to
transfer
crude
from
trucks
to
rail
and
onto
the
bnsf
system
every
day
they
have
fewer
options
of
where
to
take
it
said
ceres
ceo
robert
day
who
said
his
company
is
working
to
get
to
the
point
where
they
can
load
oil
we
re
going
to
work
real
hard
to
make
that
happen
in
the
bottlenecks
are
frustrating
for
canadian
oil
producers
because
heavy
crude
is
in
great
demand
from
gulf
of
mexico
refineries
which
are
designed
to
process
it
and
have
faced
shortages
of
venezuelan
and
mexican
heavy
crude
large
producers
tend
to
store
oil
until
they
have
enough
volume
to
fill
a
train
but
for
smaller
producers
who
can
not
shut
production
and
lack
storage
capacity
trucks
may
be
the
only
option
said
a
calgary
trader
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
can
not
put
it
back
in
the
ground
it
has
to
go
somewhere
he
said
if
your
alternative
is
a
camel
or
a
donkey
then
that
s
the
alternative
you
have
to
go
