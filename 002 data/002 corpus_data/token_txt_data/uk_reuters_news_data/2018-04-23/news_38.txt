iran
has
been
working
to
regain
market
share
after
western
sanctions
over
its
disputed
nuclear
program
were
lifted
in
under
a
deal
between
the
country
and
six
major
powers
but
president
donald
trump
has
warned
european
signatories
of
the
accord
to
fix
the
disastrous
flaws
in
the
pact
or
face
a
exit
on
may
trump
will
decide
whether
to
restore
economic
sanctions
on
tehran
which
would
be
a
severe
blow
to
the
pact
we
have
to
wait
for
trump
s
decision
but
iran
will
use
all
its
capacity
and
experience
to
protect
the
country
against
the
consequences
of
trump
s
decision
zanganeh
said
iran
has
been
striving
to
retain
customers
for
its
oil
in
asia
hoping
concessions
will
boost
the
appeal
of
its
crude
compared
with
other
middle
eastern
suppliers
even
as
the
threat
looms
of
potential
further
sanctions
on
the
country
zanganeh
said
iran
might
offer
discounts
on
oil
sales
as
the
opec
member
is
keen
to
preserve
its
market
share
iran
will
take
all
the
necessary
measures
to
keep
its
oil
market
share
because
of
the
political
atmosphere
and
the
american
president
s
decision
on
the
deal
zanganeh
said
when
asked
about
rumours
on
offering
discounts
to
india
on
oil
sales
we
have
not
given
a
special
discount
to
india
but
it
is
possible
to
make
changes
in
our
iran
used
to
be
the
oil
supplier
to
india
before
crippling
sanctions
were
imposed
by
the
united
states
and
the
european
union
on
tehran
in
tehran
is
gradually
raising
its
market
share
