in

traders
were
also
getting
a
global
round
of
economic
surveys
that
should
show
in
the
coming
days
if

in

talk
of

may
be

treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
on
saturday
he
might
travel
to
beijing
a
move
that
could
ease
tensions
between
the
two
supersized
economies
a
trip
is
under
consideration
mnuchin
said
at
a
news
conference
during
the
international
monetary
fund
and
world
bank
spring
meetings
in
washington
i
did
meet
with
the
chinese
here
the
discussions
were
really
more
around
the
governor
s
actions
at
the
pboc
people
s
bank
of
china
and
certain
actions
they
ve
announced
in
terms
of
opening
some
of
their
markets
which
we
very
much
encourage
and
back
in
commodity
markets
the
spike
in
oil
has
driven
up
both
market
expectations
of
future
inflation
and
bond
yields
yields
on
treasuries
are
at
the
highest
now
since
early
and
again
threatening
the
hugely
important
percent
bulwark
the
last
time
yields
neared
this
number
in
it
rocked
risk
appetite
and
sent
stocks
sliding
it
also
came
shortly
before
oil
prices
went
on
a
mighty
percent
tumble
another
increase
in
oil
will
be
enough
for
yields
to
threaten
percent
oil
is
now
at
the
cusp
of
levels
where
higher
prices
will
spark
greater
fx
and
broader
asset
market
volatility
said
deutsche
bank
s
macro
strategist
alan
ruskin
traditionally
the
dollar
had
a
slight
negative
correlation
with
oil
mostly
because
the
dominant
causation
goes
from
dollar
weakness
to
rising
oil
prices
he
added
if
oil
helps
push
the
yield
into
new
terrain
for
this
cycle
this
will
play
at
least
mildly
usd
positive
in
a
change
of
indeed
dealers
cited
widening
yield
differentials
for
the
dollar
s
broad
rally
the
gap
with
german
bonds
has
touched
the
widest
in
almost
three
decades
on
a
spot
basis
yields
are
testing
percent
which
is
the
highest
since
the
greenback
was
last
at
having
broken
through
major
resistance
in
the
zone
which
has
held
solid
since
the
dollar
index
powered
up
to
and
further
away
from
last
week
s
low
at
the
euro
was
easier
at
having
repeatedly
failed
to
break
above
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
investors
are
awaiting
the
european
central
bank
s
policy
meeting
on
thursday
amid
talk
that
policymakers
feel
it
is
still
too
early
to
announce
a
timetable
for
winding
down
its
bond
buying
ecb
chief
mario
draghi
said
on
friday
he
was
confident
that
the
inflation
outlook
has
picked
up
but
uncertainties
warrant
patience
persistence
and
prudence
