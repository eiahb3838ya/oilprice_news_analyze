libya
will
have
to
cover
its
grain
consumption
needs
of
around
million
tonnes
almost
entirely
by
imports
but
hopes
to
boost
production
from
the
next
harvest
a
senior
official
said
abdelmoneim
mohamed
shihab
the
top
official
in
the
agricultural
ministry
in
a
government
in
tripoli
said
the
oil
producing
nation
could
meet
at
least
half
of
its
cereal
needs
in
future
if
security
and
power
supply
improved
to
ramp
up
output
libya
will
invest
million
into
its
farming
sector
of
which
more
than
million
will
go
on
seeds
he
said
the
funds
come
after
an
emergency
project
with
the
s
food
and
agriculture
organization
fao
which
raised
the
awareness
of
the
government
to
the
importance
of
food
security
fao
officials
said
this
year
it
will
be
the
same
with
imports
meeting
consumption
but
if
the
security
improves
a
bit
then
output
will
improve
the
next
season
said
in
an
interview
electricity
supply
has
improved
we
can
reach
percent
of
million
tonnes
of
grain
consumption
he
said
when
asked
where
output
could
be
in
the
next
two
years
according
to
the
ministry
farmers
will
be
supplied
with
the
seeds
he
said
last
year
s
crop
output
was
around
tonnes
though
no
exact
figures
exist
due
to
the
dysfunctional
libyan
state
in
turmoil
since
the
toppling
of
muammar
gaddafi
in
farmers
have
been
struggling
to
get
seeds
as
a
fall
in
oil
revenues
since
has
hit
the
supply
of
foreign
exchange
needed
to
fund
imports
improving
output
would
not
just
lower
the
import
bill
of
a
country
suffering
from
economic
meltdown
but
also
provide
an
income
in
poor
rural
areas
often
cut
off
from
state
support
due
to
poor
security
and
african
migrants
working
as
farmhands
but
much
will
depend
on
whether
security
improves
the
focus
of
the
plan
is
on
the
main
farming
regions
deep
in
the
south
in
ubari
and
sebha
which
were
hit
by
tribal
fighting
and
lack
of
power
supply
as
well
as
benghazi
in
the
east
libya
a
country
of
six
million
was
once
home
to
farming
schemes
built
by
italian
colonial
rulers
but
has
neglected
the
sector
since
oil
exports
started
in
the
still
the
country
produced
up
to
tonnes
of
cereal
until
officials
said
since
then
crop
output
has
been
hovering
around
tonnes
an
fao
study
showed
seeds
and
modern
equipment
had
become
unavailable
in
many
parts
of
libya
development
has
also
been
hampered
by
a
split
between
two
governments
the
tripoli
one
and
an
eastern
rival
though
said
his
ministry
was
cooperating
on
a
technical
level
with
the
east
allowing
it
to
ship
seeds
to
benghazi
libya
also
produces
some
tonnes
of
dates
some
of
which
still
get
exported
despite
the
chaos
alongside
cooking
oil
and
strawberries
grown
in
the
more
stable
north
of
the
country
officials
said
it
s
a
difficult
situation
but
we
are
more
optimistic
now
said
but
we
need
more
