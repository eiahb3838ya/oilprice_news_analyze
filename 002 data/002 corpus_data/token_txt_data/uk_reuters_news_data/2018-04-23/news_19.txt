a
gauge
of
global
equity
markets
was
little
changed
on
monday
as
bond
yields
moved
closer
to
the
percent
level
that
has
unnerved
investors
in
recent
months
and
a
fall
in
commodity
prices
pressured
energy
and
materials
stocks
bond
prices
fell
with
the
yield
hitting
its
highest
in
over
four
years
amid
worries
about
the
growing
supply
of
government
debt
and
accelerating
inflation
as
oil
and
commodity
prices
have
been
rising
in
recent
weeks

commodities
came
under
pressure
after
the

rusal

the
potential

of
such

the
commodities
vertical
has
just
been
absolutely
on
fire
said
peter
kenny
senior
market
strategist
at
global
markets
advisory
group
in
new
york
a
lot
of
the
air
has
been
taken
out
of
that
space
because
of
the
kind
of
stepping
back
on
what
appeared
to
be
a
rather
dramatic
aluminium
on
the
london

the
climb
in
debt
yields
helped
push
the
dollar
to
a
high
to
put
additional
pressure
on
commodities
and
sent
the
euro
and
yen
lower
the
dollar
index
rose

with
the
euro
down

the
japanese
yen
weakened

oil
prices
were
also
hampered
by
comments
from
iran
s
oil
minister
who
said
there
would
be
no
need
to
extend
a
deal
on
supply
restraint
if
crude

further
crude
