california risks severe "whiplash" from drought to flood - scientists

california
will
suffer
more
volatile
weather
this
century
with
a
whiplash
from
drought
to
rain
and
mounting
risks
a
repeat
of
the
devastating
great
flood
of
scientists
said
on
monday
climate
change
driven
by
greenhouse
gas
emissions
would
drive
more
extreme
shifts
between
hot
and
dry
summers
and
wet
winters
in
the
most
populous
state
they
wrote
in
the
journal
nature
climate
change
global
warming
is
making
california
and
other
regions
with
similar
climates
from
southern
europe
to
parts
of
australia
drier
and
warmer
in
summer
said
lead
author
daniel
swain
of
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
in
california
in
winter
an
opposing
trend
toward
a
strong
pacific
jet
stream
is
projected
to
locally
enhance
precipitation
during
the
core
months
of
the
rainy
season
he
told
reuters
natural
precipitation
variability
in
this
region
is
already
large
and
projected
future
whiplash
increases
would
amplify
existing
swings
between
dry
and
wet
years
the
authors
wrote
they
projected
a
percent
to
percent
increase
in
extreme
precipitation
events
this
century
california
had
its
worst
drought
in
recorded
history
from
followed
by
severe
rains
and
flooding
that
culminated
with
evacuation
orders
for
almost
residents
as
a
precaution
near
the
oroville
dam
last
year
the
study
said
that
major
urban
centers
including
san
francisco
and
los
angeles
were
more
likely
than
not
to
suffer
a
freak
series
of
storms
by
similar
to
ones
in
that
led
to
the
great
flood
the
storms
swamped
the
sacramento
and
san
joaquin
valleys
flooding
an
area
miles
km
long
and
miles
wide
storms
washed
away
bridges
inundated
mines
and
wrecked
farms
a
repeat
would
probably
lead
to
considerable
loss
of
life
and
economic
damages
approaching
a
trillion
dollars
the
study
said
as
part
of
planning
swain
said
the
state
should
expand
use
of
floodplains
that
can
be
deliberately
flooded
to
soak
up
rains
such
as
the
yolo
bypass
which
protects
the
city
of
sacramento
the
study
assumes
however
that
global
greenhouse
gas
emissions
will
keep
rising
at
odds
with
the
goals
of
the
paris
agreement
under
which
almost
nations
agreed
to
cut
emissions
to
net
zero
between
and
such
a
future
can
be
partially
but
not
completely
avoided
if
the
world
takes
tougher
action
swain
said
he
noted
that
existing
government
pledges
to
limit
warming
fall
well
short
of
the
paris
goals
president
donald
trump
who
doubts
mainstream
findings
that
greenhouse
gas
emissions
are
the
main
cause
of
warming
plans
to
quit
the
deal
saying
he
wants
to
promote
the
fossil
fuel
industry
