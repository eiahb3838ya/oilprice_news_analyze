offshore
oil
services
firm
subsea
has
made
an
unsolicited
offer
worth
about
billion
for
rival
mcdermott
potentially
breaking
up
the
company
s
agreed
deal
with
onshore
engineering
firm
chicago
bridge
iron
cb
i
the
deal
could
make
subsea
the
market
leader
in
supplying
and
installing
subsea
equipment
for
oil
and
gas
firms
with
a
combined
market
share
of
percent
followed
by
technipfmc
with
percent
and
saipem
with
percent
an
consultancy
rystad
energy
said
the
flurry
of
m
a
activity
comes
as
oil
prices
have
risen
to
more
than
a
barrel
lifting
the
need
for
offshore
services
and
the
appetite
for
offshore
investments
it
follows
a
tough
period
when
the
oil
services
industry
was
hit
by
a
fall
in
oil
prices
and
spending
cuts
by
major
oil
companies
subsea
said
combining
the
two
companies
would
make
them
better
equipped
to
handle
large
offshore
engineering
contracts
for
the
oil
industry
jean
cahuzac
chief
executive
of
subsea
said
the
potential
deal
could
provide
growth
opportunities
in
the
middle
east
where
mcdermott
has
a
strong
position
subsea
has
offered
mcdermott
per
share
either
in
cash
or
up
to
percent
in
stock
representing
a
premium
of
percent
over
mcdermott
s
closing
share
price
on
friday
of
subsea
said
mcdermott
s
board
had
rejected
its
proposal
on
april
but
also
said
it
could
raise
its
offer
if
the
company
agreed
to
talks
mcdermott
said
in
a
separate
statement
its
board
had
concluded
that
subsea
s
proposal
significantly
undervalued
the
company
and
was
not
an
attractive
alternative
to
the
proposed
combination
with
cb
i
mcdermott
s
shares
were
up
by
around
percent
while
cb
i
shares
were
down
around
percent
by
gmt
subsea
shares
closed
up
percent
mcdermott
announced
last
december
it
would
buy
cb
i
in
an
deal
worth
billion
to
create
an
integrated
construction
and
engineering
services
provider
shareholders
of
mcdermott
and
cb
i
are
set
to
vote
on
may
on
whether
to
approve
mcdermott
s
offer
for
cb
i
subsea
said
its
bid
proposal
was
subject
to
the
termination
of
mcdermott
s
deal
with
cb
i
if
that
deal
falls
through
mcdermott
might
have
to
pay
a
million
termination
fee
the
company
has
said
two
proxy
advisory
firms
institutional
shareholder
services
and
glass
lewis
llc
have
recommended
that
cb
i
shareholders
vote
for
the
mcdermott
offer
some
of
mcdermott
s
shareholders
however
have
opposed
the
deal
citing
cb
i
s
latest
performance
blackrock
inc
the
world
s
largest
asset
manager
is
the
top
shareholder
in
mcdermott
with
a
percent
stake
it
s
a
very
well
played
offer
from
subsea
timing
wise
it
gives
enough
time
for
mcdermott
management
to
consider
alternatives
before
the
may
vote
carnegie

lunde
said
subsea

to
consolidate

a
means
to
cope
with

oil
companies
siem
said
on
monday
the
company
had
decided
to
make

shareholders
and
one
board
member
voiced
opposition
to
the
proposal
to
buy
cb
i
cahuzac
said
on
monday
the
company
could
revise
its
offer
if
mcdermott
s
board
decides
to
start
talks
and
provides
more
information
about
its
business
subsea
said
combining
the
two
companies
would
help
them
to
handle
large
offshore
engineering
contracts
for
the
oil
industry
known
as
epci
projects
with
subsea
s
strengths
in
brazil
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
north
sea
complementing
mcdermott
s
strengths
in
the
middle
east
india
and
australia
geographically
speaking
subsea
and
mcdermott
are
a
perfect
match

mcdermott
is
the
