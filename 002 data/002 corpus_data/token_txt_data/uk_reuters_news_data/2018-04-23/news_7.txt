two
chevron
employees
detained
in
venezuela
last
week
could
be
charged
with
treason
for
refusing
to
sign
a
parts
contract
for
a
joint
venture
with
oil
company
pdvsa
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with
draft
charges
against
the
firm
s
executives
the
arrests
by
national
intelligence
agents
marked
the
first
at
a
western
oil
firm
in
venezuela
and
represent
a
dramatic
escalation
of
growing
tensions
between
pdvsa
and
foreign
companies
over
control
of
supply
contracts
the
sources
told
reuters
the
widening
dispute
could
worsen
operational
chaos
that
has
caused
the
opec
nation
s
oil
output
to
plunge
by
percent
or
barrels
per
day
since
october
these
detentions
are
going
to
accelerate
the
operational
crisis
another
source
with
knowledge
of
chevron
s
operations
told
reuters
procurement
could
end
up
in
paralysis
if
nobody
wants
to
take
the
risk
of
signing
or
authorizing
the
draft
treason
charges
seen
by
chevron
lawyers
last
week
the
two
sources
said
raised
concern
that
the
oil
major
could
get
caught
in
the
crossfire
between
washington
and
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
who
accuses
the
government
of
sabotaging
the
economy
to
topple
his
administration
the
united
states
has
imposed
sanctions
on
senior
members
of
maduro
s
government
and
pdvsa
the
two
chevron
employees
were
jailed
when
they
refused
to
sign
a
supply
contract
written
by
pdvsa
executives
under
an
emergency
decree
which
skips
the
competitive
bidding
process
according
to
a
half
dozen
sources
close
to
the
case
such
decrees
have
been
cited
by
venezuela
prosecutors
as
a
means
of
extracting
bribes
in
some
recent
pdvsa
corruption
cases
the
chevron
employees
balked
when
the
parts
were
listed
at
more
than
double
their
market
price
in
a
contract
worth
several
million
dollars
one
of
the
sources
told

the

venezuelan
authorities
have
yet
to
comment
on
the
arrest
of
the
men
both
venezuelans
and
no
charges
against
them
have
been
made
public
the
venezuela
public
prosecutor
s
office
declined
to
comment
and
pdvsa
did
not
respond
to
several
requests
for
comment
the
arrests
follow
a
purge
that
has
seen
more
than
executives
at
pdvsa
and
its
suppliers
jailed
for
alleged
corruption
as
the
state
firm

new
chief
major

the
financial
lifeblood
of

government
tensions
between
pdvsa
and
foreign
oil

have
steadily
risen
since
quevedo
took
charge
in
november
and
appointed
military
officers
who
had
little
or
no
oil

pushed
for
a
greater

oil
industry
sources
said
but
disputes
over
governance
standards
have
caused
operational
delays
raising
tensions
over
venezuela
s
falling
oil
output
in
february
the
petropiar
upgrader
had
been
temporarily
halted
because
of
problems
scheduling
its
exports
and
pdvsa
executives
were
concerned
it
could
be
forced
to
stop
again
due
to
lack
of
spare
parts
one
of
the
sources
said
when
the
imported
furnace
parts
did
not
arrive
on
time
pdvsa
executives
blamed
the
chevron
employees
for
the
delays
according
to
the
two
sources
familiar
with
the
draft
charges
the
men
are
being
represented
by
chevron
lawyers
the
charges
against
them
have
not
been
formalised
and
could
change
the
two
sources
said
a
spokesman
for
chevron
declined
to
comment
venezuela
defines
treason
as
conspiring
with
foreign
enemies
against
the
state
and
proscribes
punishment
of
up
to
years
in

in
the
coastal
city
of
barcelona
according
to
the
two

the
detentions
highlight
the
growing
difficulties
for
foreign
oil
firms
amid
a
deepening
economic
crisis

allegations
of
rampant

a

earlier
this

their
concerns
over
procurement
and
governance
to
quevedo
according
to
documents
seen
by

pdvsa
has
a
minimum
percent
stake
in
joint
ventures
and
has
been
slow
to
share
operational
control

one
