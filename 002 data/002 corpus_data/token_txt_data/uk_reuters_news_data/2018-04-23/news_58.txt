world
stocks
slipped
on
monday
as
investors
braced
for
a
blizzard
of
earnings
from
the
world
s
largest
firms
while
keeping
a
wary
eye
on
bond
yields
as
they
approach
peaks
that
have
triggered
market
spasms
in
the
past
the
yield
on
treasuries
hit
its
highest
level
since
january
at
percent
in
early
european
trade
as
the
spread
over
the
german
equivalent
briefly
touched
its
widest
level
in
years
traders
were
also
getting
a
global
round
of
economic
surveys
that
should
show
if
economic
softness
in
the
first
quarter
was
just
a
passing
phase
linked
to
wintery

the

readings
from

france
and
germany
were
all
relatively
reassuring
japan

firmed
as
output
and
domestic
demand
picked
up
france
was
helped
by
its
services
sector
while
germany
was
also
above
forecast
despite
weaker
new
orders
numbers
it
s
a
good
reading
it
s
still
encouraging
said
chris
williamson
chief

at

markit
of
the

euro

numbers
which
he
said
pointed
to
quarterly
gdp
growth
of
percent
on
the
geopolitical
front
there
was
plenty
to
digest
too
signs
that
relations
may
be
thawing
were
offset
somewhat
as
president
donald
trump
cautioned
the
north
korean
nuclear
crisis
was
a
long
way
from
being
resolved
a
day
after
the
north
pledged
to
end
its
nuclear
tests
oil
prices
edged
down
in
early
trade
but
were
not
far
from
their
highest
since
late
the
market
had
wobbled
on
friday
when
trump
tweeted
criticism
of
opec

role
in
pushing
up
global
prices

markets
msci
s

fell

after
asia
shed

overnight
and
europe
then

as
results
from

ubs
disappointed
and
the
rise
in

put
pressure
on

futures

also
pointing
to
lower

for

are
due
to
report
results
this

including
amazon

boeing
and

of
particular
concern
for
analysts
will
be
executives
views
about
their
exposure
to
china
the
world
s
no
economy
and
an
important
market
for
many
companies
amid
the
recent
worries
about
a
trade
war
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
on
saturday
he
may
travel
to
china
a
move
that
could
ease
tensions
between
the
two
supersized
economies
a
trip
is
under
consideration
mnuchin
said
at
a
news
conference
during
the
international
monetary
fund
and
world
bank
spring
meetings
in
washington
i
did
meet
with
the
chinese
here
the
discussions
were
really
more
around
the
governor
s
actions
at
the
pboc
people
s
bank
of
china
and
certain
actions
they
ve
announced
in
terms
of
opening
some
of
their
markets
which
we
very
much
encourage
and
back
in
commodity
markets
the
spike
in
oil
has
driven
up
both
market
expectations
of
future
inflation
and
bond
yields
yields
on
treasuries
are
at
the
highest
now
since
early
at
percent
and
again
threatening
the
hugely
important
percent
bulwark
the
last
time
yields
neared
this
number
in
it
rocked
risk
appetite
and
sent
stocks
sliding
it
also
came
shortly
before
oil
prices
went
on
a
mighty
percent
tumble
another
increase
in
oil
will
be
enough
for
yields
to
threaten
percent
oil
is
now
at
the
cusp
of
levels
where
higher
prices
will
spark
greater
fx
and
broader
asset
market
volatility
said
deutsche
bank
s
macro
strategist
alan
ruskin
traditionally
the
dollar
had
a
slight
negative
correlation
with
oil
mostly
because
the
dominant
causation
goes
from
dollar
weakness
to
rising
oil
prices
he
added
if
oil
helps
push
the
yield
into
new
terrain
for
this
cycle
this
will
play
at
least
mildly
usd
positive
in
a
change
of

dealers
cited
widening

differentials
for
the
dollar
s
broad
rally
on
friday
the

testing
major
resistance
in
the

has
held
solid
since
the

index
edged
up

it
is
still
too
early

draghi
