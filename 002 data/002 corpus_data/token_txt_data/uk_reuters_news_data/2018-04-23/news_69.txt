column-china coal imports tumble on new rules, india yet to take up the slack: russell

expressed

are
those

china
s
decision
to
impose
fresh
restrictions
on
imports
of
coal
at
some
ports
appears
to
have
caused
a
sharp
fall
in
inbound
shipments
of
the
polluting
fuel
the
measures
announced
on
april
included
banning
the
unloading
of
imported
coal
at
some
ports
and
tightening
customs
clearances
while
it
s
still
too
early
to
discern
a
definitive
trend
china
s
seaborne
coal
imports
slumped
to
million
tonnes
in
the
week
ended
april
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
supply
chain
and
commodity
forecasts
this
was
down
almost
percent
on
the
million
tonne
weekly
average
that
was
recorded
from
to
april
it
s
also
lower
than
the
weekly
average
of
million
tonnes
for
seaborne
imports
in
it
is
possible
that
there
are
other
factors
at
play
in
the
slump
in
seaborne
imports
last
week
including
lower
demand
in
the
usually
softer
period
between
the
northern
winter
and
summer
peaks
but
a
decline
of
the
magnitude
seen
last
week
suggests
that
the
import
restrictions
had
an
immediate
and
profound
impact
it
s
believed
the
authorities
in
beijing
took
the
steps
to
crimp
some
imports
as
part
of
efforts
to
boost
domestic
thermal
coal
prices
and
production
certainly
domestic
thermal
coal
prices
have
benefited
with
futures
on
the
zhengzhou
commodity
exchange
jumping
percent
last
week
to
finish
at
yuan
a
tonne
on
april
a
high
prices
for
seaborne
thermal
coal
were
more
subdued
with
argus
media
s
assessment
of
the
kilocalorie
per
kilogram
grade
at
australia
s
newcastle
port
dropping
fractionally
over
the
week
to
end
at
a
tonne
on
april
this
grade
of
coal
is
generally
preferred
by
chinese
buyers
because
of
its
discount
to
the
coal
which
is
more
usually
sought
by
utilities
in
japan
and
south
korea
since
peaking
this
year
at
a
tonne
in
early
february
cargoes
of
the
grade
have
dropped
percent
while
those
for
the
are
down
by
a
more
modest
percent
from
the
peak
in
late
february
it
would
be
logical
to
expect
the
discount
of
supplies
to
widen
further
if
china
does
continue
to
restrict
imports
of
coal
in
coming
months
falling
prices
would
help
open
up
india
to
australia
s
thermal
coal
supplies
although
there
is
little
sign
yet
that
this
is
happening
the
bulk
of
coal
supplied
to
india
from
australia
is
coking
coal
used
to
make
steel
australian
thermal
coal
cargoes
generally
struggle
to
find
buyers
in
india
given
the
higher
price
and
transport
costs
when
competing
against
supplies
from
the
region
s
other
major
exporters
indonesia
and
south
africa
but
the
recent
price
decline
for
australian
cargoes
may
make
them
competitive
against
similar
grade
coal
from
south
africa
argus
assessed
coal
at
south
africa
s
richards
bay
port
at
a
tonne
well
above
the
for
coal
at
australia
s
newcastle
port
some
of
the
difference
will
be
eaten
up
by
the
longer
sea
journey
from
australia
s
east
coast
to
india
but
the
likelihood
is
that
indian
buyers
may
well
be
open
to
picking
up
any
australian
cargoes
that
become
distressed
because
of
the
recent
chinese
restrictions
however
coal
prices
may
still
be
too
high
to
attract
significant
indian
interest
given
the
south
asian
nation
generally
is
highly
price
sensitive
and
cuts
back
on
imports
when
prices
are
strong
as
they
have
been
in
recent
months
and
port
data
show
that
india
imported
million
tonnes
of
all
grades
of
coal
in
the
first
quarter
a
monthly
rate
of
million
tonnes
this
is
below
the
monthly
rate
of
million
tonnes
for
showing
that
while
imported
coal
may
well
be
needed
in
india
it
s
probably
still
too
expensive
to
be
attractive
