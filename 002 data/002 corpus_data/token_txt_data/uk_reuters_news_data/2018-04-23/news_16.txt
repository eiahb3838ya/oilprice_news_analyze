update 1-britain to set up compensation scheme for "windrush" migrants
london
reuters
britain
will
compensate
some
caribbean
immigrants
who
have
lived
legally
in
britain
for
decades
and
have
wrongly
been
labelled
illegal
immigrants
because
of
trouble
documenting
their
status
interior
minister
amber
rudd
said
on
monday
the
government
will
also
waive
fees
associated
with
becoming
a
citizen
and
ensure
these
british
residents
do
not
have
to
pass
britain
s
citizenship
test
rudd
told
parliament
instead
she
said
individuals
would
be
assigned
a
case
worker
who
would
decide
on
nationality
and
the
burden
of
proof
has
been
shifted
so
the
government
would
take
a
more
lenient
approach
the
state
has
let
these
people
down
rudd
said
none
of
this
can
undo
the
pain
already
endured
but
i
hope
it
demonstrates
the
government
s
commitment
to
put
these
wrongs
right
going
thousands
of
people
from
the
windrush
generation
were
invited
to
britain
to
plug
labour
shortfalls
between
and
but
some
of
them
and
their
descendants
have
been
caught
out
by
tighter
immigration
rules
some
of
these
migrants
have
been
asked
to
provide
documentary
evidence
of
their
life
in
britain
they
had
never
previously
been
required
to
keep
and
in
some
cases
denied
rights
detained
and
threatened
with
deportation
the
crisis
has
cast
britain
in
an
unsympathetic
light
and
raised
awkward
questions
about
how
the
aggressive
pursuit
of
lower
immigration
sits
alongside
the
desire
to
be
an
global
economy
migrants
who
have
already
returned
to
their
country
of
origin
but
want
to
come
back
as
british
citizens
will
be
helped
to
do
so
rudd
said
rudd
emphasised
her
commitment
to
tackling
illegal
immigration
but
conceded
that
successive
governments
bore
responsibility
for
the
policies
that
had
an
unintended
and
sometimes
devastating
impact
on
people
these
people
worked
here
for
decades
in
many
cases
they
helped
establish
the
national
health
services
they
paid
their
taxes
they
are
british
in
all
but
legal
status
and
this
should
never
have
been
allowed
to
happen
rudd
said
rudd
said
all
interior
ministry
records
dating
back
to
would
be
checked
to
see
if
anyone
had
been
wrongly
deported
but
no
cases
had
been
identified
so
far
with
about
half
of
the
documents
verified
the
shadow
interior
minister
diane
abbott
welcomed
the
measures
and
said
the
compensation
should
be
more
than
more
than
just
a
token
amount
the
home
secretary
has
to
understand
that
ultimately
the
buck
stops
with
her
abbott
said
the
home
secretary
said
the
situation
should
never
have
been
allowed
to
happen
she
was
the
home
secretary
she
should
never
have
allowed
them
