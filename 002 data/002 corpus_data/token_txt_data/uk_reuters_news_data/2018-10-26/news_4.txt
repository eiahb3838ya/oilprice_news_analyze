of
percent
per
year
annual
improvement
paired
with
policy
incentives
that
support
a
transition
to
future
vehicle
electrification
can
provide
a
balanced
the
proposal
to
freeze
fuel
efficiency
standards
has
set
up
a
major
battle
between
the
trump
administration
and
california
over
whether
the
largest
state
which
has
made
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
a
major
priority
will
continue

have
authority
to
oversee

in
separate
comments
filed
friday
california
said
the

would
worsen
air
quality
for
the
most
vulnerable
waste
billions
of
gallons
of
gasoline
forfeit
our
best
chance
to
fight
climate
change
and
result
in
years
of
uncertainty
in
the
california
governor
jerry
brown
said
at
a
news
conference
friday
that
president
donald
trump
was
taking
steps
to
destroy
the
american
automobile
industry
and
called
him
a
demolition
he
suggested
that
if
automakers
stopped
building

they
ll
be
working
for
chinese
acting
environmental
protection
agency
administrator
andrew
wheeler
said
the
federal
government
was
still
waiting
for
a
formal
from
california
it
is
my
hope
that
we
can
continue
to
work
together
and
reach
one
national
standard
he
said
in
a
statement
california
air
resources
board
chief
mary
nichols
said
the
federal
government
had
not
moved
off
its
initial
proposal
we
remain
open
to
talking
to
them
she
said
friday
friday
marked
the
deadline
for
the
filing
of
comments
on
the
administration
s
proposal
which
details
a
number
of
potential
alternatives
the
trump
plan
s
preferred
alternative
would
freeze
standards
at
levels
through
and
hike
oil
consumption
by
about
barrels
per
day
by
the
but
reduce
automakers
regulatory
costs
by
more
than
billion
the
proposal
would
bar
california
from
requiring
automakers
to
sell
a
rising
number
of
electric
vehicles
the
obama
administration
had
adopted
rules
that
call
for
a
nearly
percent
annual
increase
in
fuel
efficiency
requirements
over
that
period
the
trump
administration
argues
the
new
rules
will
save
up
to
motorists
lives
over
the
coming
decades
because
they
lower
the
price
of
new
vehicles
prod
people
into
buying
safer
newer
vehicles
faster
and
result
in
motorists
driving
less
because
vehicles
will
cost
more
to
operate
a
memo
released
in
august
from
the
epa
said
some
officials
believed
the
plan
would
actually
increase
traffic
deaths
from
through
because
of
increasing
vehicle
travel
