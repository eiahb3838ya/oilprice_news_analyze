update 1-global oil pricing worries hit u.s. energy shares as earnings loom
new
york
reuters
worries
over
global
oil
pricing
and
pipeline
constraints
are
hanging
over
the
energy
sector
as
companies
begin
to
report
quarterly
results
with
many
producers
shares
trading
lower
on
the
year
profits
for
oil
producers
generally
should
be
higher
than
a
year
ago
because
the
average
price
per
barrel
was
up
about
percent
over
the
same
period
last
year
but
oil
prices
on
friday
registered
their
third
straight
weekly
decline
extending
a
slide
on
concerns
that
slower
global
economic
growth
and
the
trade
war
could
dent
demand
crude
is
on
track
for
a
decline
of
roughly
percent
for
the
month
while
the
s
p
energy
index
is
down
percent
so
far
in
october
compared
with
the
benchmark
s
p
percent
decline
crude
prices
averaged
a
barrel
in
the
third
quarter
up
sharply
from
a
year
earlier
analysts
expect
this
helped
boost
s
p
energy
companies
quarterly
earnings
percent
the
biggest
expected
growth
among
sectors
according
to
data
from
refinitiv
that
would
be
the
biggest
expected
percentage
growth
of
any
sector
for
the
quarter
still
some
investors
say
it
may
not
be
enough
to
reverse
the
trend
in
shares
given
trade
and
other
worries
i
expect
earnings
will
be
good
because
the
last
quarter
prices
were
good
said
rick
meckler
partner
at
cherry
lane
investments
a
family
investment
office
in
new
vernon
new
jersey
but
it
has
been
very
difficult
for
these
companies
to
forecast
pricing
because
it
has
been
so
volatile
he
said
companies
that
provide
drilling
and
other
work
for
producers
have
blamed
a
slowdown
in
services
demand
due
to
pipeline
and
other
constraints
particularly
in
the
west
texas
shale
fields
while
sanctions
against
iranian
oil
exports
could
support
prices
in
the
coming
months
top
exporters
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
been
signalling
they
expect
to
increase
production
which
should
limit
increases
upcoming
earnings
reports
with
exxon
mobil
and
chevron
both
due
could
reflect
those
issues
exxon
is
down
nearly
percent
for
the
month
to
date
while
chevron
also
is
down
almost
percent
we
seen
oil
prices
sell
off
here
throughout
the
correction
we
had
in
the
broad
market
the
concern
in
the
is
clearly
global
growth
and
that
immediately
reflected
in
oil
prices
said
tim
ghriskey
chief
investment
strategist
at
inverness
counsel
in
new
york
ubs
analysts
expect
oil
demand
to
grow
more
slowly
in
on
higher
oil
prices
and
weaker
economic
growth

due
to

while
conocophillips
the

largest
independent
oil
and

producer
beat

estimates
for
profit
in
the
third
quarter
when
it
reported
thursday
citing
higher
oil
prices
but
also

some
equity
strategists
consider
oil
to
be
in
a
bullish
cycle
and
expect
prices
to
rise
further
over
the
next
year
energy
shares
have
sharply
underperformed
oil
prices
so
far
this
year
suggesting
there
is
room
for

people
are
still
thinking
we

at

we
re
not

in

which

producer
diamondback
energy
and

people
are
misjudging
the
balance
between
supply
and
demand
said
lutts
who
sees
oil
prices
heading
towards
to
a
barrel
within
a
year
crude
settled
at
on
friday
even
with
the
recent
selloff
oil
prices
are
up
roughly
percent
for
the
year
to
date
while
the
s
p
energy
index
is
down
about
percent
for
and
market
leader
exxon
is
down
about
percent
some
money
managers
also
consider
energy
shares
to
be
more
attractive
buys
now
with
investors
fleeing
technology
and
internet
names
in
the
recent
stock
market
and
seeking
names
others
say
it
is
still
too
soon
for
a
bullish
call
on
energy
to
get
a
sustained
move
in
oil
stocks
where
they
consistently
outperform
other
sectors
and
where
the
sector
is
actually
growing
as
a
component
of
the
s
p
you
need
a
lot
of
things
like
the
supply
constraint
and
global
growth
we
re
not
there
right
now
