began
to
ship
crude
from

trump
s
decision
to
withdraw
the
united
states
from
a
international
nuclear
accord
with
tehran
in
may
and
reimpose
sanctions
has
put
iraqi
prime
minister
adel
abdul
mahdi
s
incoming
government
in
a
difficult
position
as
the
country
s
economy
is
closely
intertwined
with
neighbouring
iran
abdul
mahdi
said
on
thursday
that
iraq
would
prioritise
its

independence
when

flows
towards
turkey
if
turkey
gets
more
