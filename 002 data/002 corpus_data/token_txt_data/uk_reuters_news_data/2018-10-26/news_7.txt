added
oil
rigs
for

week
in
a

for
the
first
time
since
june
keeping
the

count
at
its

in
over
three
years
as
declining
productivity
in
some
shale
fields

to
drill
more

in

closely
followed
report
on
friday
for
the
month
the

count
rose
in
october
the
biggest
monthly
increase
since
drillers
added
rigs
in
may
that
was
also
the
first
time
the
count
increased
for
four
months
in
a
row
since
july
but
the
increases
from
july
through
to
september
where
marginal
as
new
drilling
largely
stalled
due
to
pipeline
constraints
in
the
permian
basin
more
than
half
the
total
oil
rigs
are
in
the

biggest

active
units
there
decreased
by
one
this
week
to
last
week
the
permian
count
rose
to
its
highest
since
january
the
rig
count
an
early
indicator
of
future
output
is
higher
than
a
year
ago
when
rigs
were
active
because
energy
companies
have
ramped
up
production
to
capture
prices
that
are
higher

crude
futures
were
trading
around

putting
the
contract
on
track
to
fall
for
a
third

since
then
that
new

was
expected
to
decline
to

in

according
to
the

productivity
report
last

that
means
energy

must
drill
more

just
to

even
though
the
number
of

drilled
last
month
in
the
permian
rose
to
its
highest
since
december
completions
are
not
keeping
up
causing
the
number
of
wells
drilled
but
uncompleted
ducs
in
the

to
rise
to
a
