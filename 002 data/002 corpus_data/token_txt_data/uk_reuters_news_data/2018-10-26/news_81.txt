the
international
maritime
organization
imo
has
so
far
resisted
pressure
to
soften
or
postpone
the
implementation
of
new
regulations
requiring
ships
to
use
bunker
fuels
with
a
lower
sulphur
content
from
the
start
of
that
has
prompted
warnings
from
some
analysts
that
the
regulations
will
squeeze
the
availability
of
diesel
and
jet
kerosene
required
by
trucks
trains
aircraft
farmers
and
industry
resulting
in
big
price
increases
the
regulations
and
any
associated
rise
in
fuel
prices
will
occur
in
the
run
up
to
the
next
presidential
election
so
there
is
considerable
political
sensitivity
around
the
timing
and
cost
of
the
changes
but
most
imo
members
are
confident
there
will
be
enough
fuel
available
to
meet
the
needs
of
both
the
shipping
industry
and
other
users
of
middle
distillates
without
an
unacceptable
spike
in
prices
from
ships
will
be
required
to
use
fuel
oil
containing
no
more
than
percent

a
maximum

reduced

for
the

were
originally
approved
by

the

was
reconfirmed
following

multiple
scenarios
for

and

at
the
end
of

the
study
concluded
that
in
all
scenarios
the
refinery
sector
has
the
capability
to
supply
sufficient
quantities
of
marine
fuels
to
meet
demand
for
these
products
while
also
meeting
demand
for
fuels
capacity
increases
in
crude
distillation
as
well
as

be

others
in
the
industry
have
been
less
sanguine
about
the
availability
of
sufficient
fuel
for
both
marine
and
inland
users
and
warned
about
price
increases
earlier
this
year
the
international
energy
agency
assessed
the
new
regulations
would
divert
around
barrels
per
day
of
low
sulphur
distillate
from
other
uses
to
the
shipping
industry
the
agency
warned
diesel
prices
might
have
to
rise

much
as

this
week
the
agency
presented
a
less
worrying
scenario
to
the
imo
suggesting
diesel
availability
may
be
less
stretched
owing
to
slower
global
growth
and
a
shift
away
from
diesel
in
key
economies
diesel
demand
is
slowing
in
europe
and
may
be
hitting
a
plateau
in
china
while
slower

growth
will
also

been
lobbying
for
an
phase
that
would

the

of
the
sulphur

seeks
late
change
to
rules
financial
times
the
global
shipping
industry
accounted
for
percent
of
heavy
fuel
oil
and
percent
of
gasoil
used
worldwide
in
under
imo
rules
ship
owners
have
two
routes
to
comply
with
the
reduced
sulphur
caps
switch
consumption
to
fuels
containing
less
sulphur
or
install
exhaust
gas
cleaning
systems
commonly
known
as
scrubbers
installing
scrubbers
involves
a
large
upfront
cost
of
several
million
dollars
per
ship
but
will
allow
them
to
continue
burning
cheaper
fuel
oil
capital
investment
to
lower
operating
costs
switching
consumption
to
fuels
avoids
upfront
costs
but
locks
owners
into
buying
more
expensive
fuels
lowering
capital
investment
but
raising
operating
costs
the
imo
s
consultants
forecast
that
around
ships
would
be
fitted
with
scrubbers
by
the
start
of
january
they
predicted
most
ship
owners
would
leave
installations
until
to
delay
capital
costs
as
late
as
possible
and
avoid
incurring
costs
until
they
could
take
advantage
of
discounted
fuel
oil
these
forecasts
appear
reasonably
accurate
by
around
ships
will
be
fitted
with
scrubbers
on
the
most
recent
estimate
by
norwegian
consulting
firm
dnv
gl
a
total
of
vessels
have
already
been
fitted
with
scrubbers
according
to
a
report
issued
by
the
firm
on
some
scrubbers
were
installed
or
confirmed
this
year
nearly
double
the
reported
in
it
said
the
number
is
forecast
to
soar
to
in
and
remain
at
similar
rates
into
vessels
that
do
not
install
scrubbers
will
be
required
to
buy
fuel
certified
as
containing
less
than
percent
sulphur
from
and
will
likely
be
banned
from
carrying
any
fuel
over
this
limit
after
march
one
option
will
be
to
buy
heavy
fuel
oil
with
reduced
sulphur
content
another
will
be
to
switch
to
marine
gasoil
a
third
will
be
to
switch
to
a
blended
fuel
designed
to
bring
average
sulphur
levels
under
the
cap
all
these
options
are
likely
to
add
to
the
fuel
bills
for
ship
owners
which
they
will
seek
to
pass
on
to
charterers
and
freight
companies
but
the
main
concern
focuses
on
how
many
ship
owners
will
switch
to
using
marine
gasoil
which
is
essentially
the
same
product
as
road
diesel
distillate
fuel
oil
and
jet
fuel
switching
will
put
ship
owners
in
direct
competition
with
motorists
haulage
firms
railroads
farmers
airlines
and
the
heating
oil
industry
for
the
same
molecules
pushing
up
prices
for
all
of
them
because
so
much
distillate
is
used
in
industry
and
freight
transportation
distillate
consumption
is
heavily
geared
towards
the
economic
cycle
distillate
markets
have
been
relatively
tight
in
and
were
expected
to
tighten
further
in
assuming
the
economic
expansion
continues
as
the
iea
notes
however
there
has
recently
been
some
shift
away
from
diesel
among
european
motorists
following
the
emissions
cheating
scandal
and
consumption
growth
may
also
be
moderating
in
china
more
importantly
the
global
economic
and
trade
cycle
shows
increasing
signs
of
maturity
and
may
move
into
a
more
moderate
phase
over
the
next
months
refiners
have
also
undertaken
extensive
expansions
and
upgrades
to
reduce
their
production
of
residuals
and
increase
output
of
fuel
oil
and
gasoil
having
made
expensive
investments
many
refiners
and
bunkering
firms
have
urged
the
imo
to
press
ahead
with
the
introduction
of
the
new
sulphur
cap
there
are
still
concerns
about
the
potential
impact
on
gasoil
availability
and
prices
in
in
gasoil
prices
moved
briefly
to
a
premium
of
almost
per
barrel
over
brent
in
part
because
of
concerns
about
availability
so
far
gasoil
cracks
for
fuel
delivered
in
january
the
first
month
after
the
sulphur
cap
is
introduced
have
risen
from
a
recent
low
of
per
barrel
to
almost
the
discount
for
fuel
oil
delivered
in
january
has
widened
from
in
august
to
around
the
big
margin
between
gasoil
and
fuel
prices
is
necessary
to
ensure
at
least
some
vessel
owners
switch
to
scrubbers
the
risk
of
future
price
spikes
can
not
be
ruled
out
but
so
far
the
price
mechanism
appears
to
be
working

intended
