british
shale
gas
company
cuadrilla
said
it
has
paused
fracking
at
its
preston
new
road
site
in
lancashire
northwest
england
after
a
small
tremor
was
detected
the
company
had
restarted
fracking
for
natural
gas
at
the
site
just
weeks
ago
after
its
activities
at
a
nearby
site
were
halted
seven
years
earlier
for
causing
tremors
hydraulically
fracturing
or
fracking
involves
extracting
gas
from
rocks
by
breaking
them
up
with
water
and
chemicals
at
high
pressure
the
british
government
keen
to
cut
its
reliance
on
imports
as
north
sea
supplies
dry
up
tightened
regulation
of
the
industry
and
gave
consent
earlier
this
year
for
cuadrilla
to
start
fracking
at
two
wells
preston
new
road
it
introduced
a
system
that
immediately
suspends
work
if
any
seismic
activity
of
a
magnitude
or
above
is
detected
cuadrilla
said
on
friday
the
micro
seismic
event
it
detected
early
on
had
a
magnitude
of
so
it
would
temporarily
pause
activities
under
the
traffic
light
system
operations
have
now
paused
for
the
next
hours
during
which
seismicity
levels
will
continue
to
be
measured
cuadrilla
said
in
a
statement
the
company
said
the
event
was
well
below
anything
that
would
be
felt
on
the
surface
and
was
only
detected
due
to
the
sensitive
monitoring
system
it
has
put
in
place
all
the
relevant
regulators
were
informed
without
delay
and
we
have
verified
that
the
well
integrity
is
intact

said
it
expects
to
resume
fracking

fund
managed
by
riverstone
said
earlier
this
month
it
expects
to
spend
at
least
three
months
fracking
two
horizontal
wells
to
test
flow
rates
to
determine
whether
gas
extraction
would
be
viable
