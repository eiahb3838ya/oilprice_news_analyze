asian
shares
wobbled
in
early
friday
trade
struggling
to
shake
off
the
previous
day
s
global
markets
rout
after
weak
results
from
tech
giants
alphabet
inc
and
heightened
concerns
over
world
trade
and
economic
growth
the
shaky
start
for
regional
bourses
came
despite
a
bounce
on
wall
street
overnight
which
was
helped
by
and
positive
earnings
from
microsoft
those
gains
were
put
into
perspective
however
as
shares
of
both
inc
and
alphabet
inc
fell
sharply
after
the
closing
bell
on
disappointing
earnings
predictably
the
nasdaq
futures
turned
down
percent
and
s
p
futures
fell
percent
underscoring
broad
worries
about
corporate
earnings
and
the
outlook
for
the
economy
which
triggered
a
rout
on
wall
street
on
wednesday
and
sent
global
markets
into
a
tailspin
in
asia
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
was
flat
after
pushing
slightly
lower
in
the
opening
hour
the

has
been
bruised
by
a
heavy
in
the
past
several
days
tumbling
more
than

this

was
the

thursday
s
percent
slide
financial
markets
have
been
whipsawed
in
recent
sessions
on
concerns
over
global
growth
as
investors
fretted
over
trade
frictions
a
mixed
bag
of
corporate
earnings
federal

rate
hikes
and
italian
budget
woes
a
slowdown
in
china
has
been
particularly
worrying
for
policy
makers
and
investors
hitting
asset
markets
from
stocks
to
currencies
and
commodities
analysts
at
capital
economics
sounded
a
cautious
note
suggesting
that
the
bounce
in
the
s
p
index
on
thursday
was
only
temporary
as
investors
worries
about
the
economic
outlook
worsen
the
first
and
most
important
worry
is
that
fed
tightening
and
fading
fiscal
stimulus
will
cause
the
us
economy
to
take
a
turn
for
the
worse
the
second
is
that
china
s
economy
will
continue
to
struggle
the
analysts
said
in
a
note
to
clients
as
we
have
been
arguing
for
a
while
now
these
worries
are
likely
to
get
worse
over
the
next
twelve
months
or
investors
will
get
a
chance
to
check
the
economic
pulse
later
friday
when
the

releases
gdp
data
anz
analysts
highlighted
weak
core
durable
goods
data
as
suggesting
that
investment
is
not
taking
off
even
with
the
apparent
tailwind
from
tax
cuts
and
usd
this
indicates
that
the
boost
to
gdp
growth
from
the
fiscal
stimulus
could
be
fairly
transitory
the
analysts
said
in
currency
markets
the
euro
edged
lower

weakness

european
