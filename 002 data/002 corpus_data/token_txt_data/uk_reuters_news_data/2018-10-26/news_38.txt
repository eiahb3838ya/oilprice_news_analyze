update 3-u.n. shipping agency pushes ahead with tougher marine fuel rules
london
reuters
the
united
nations
shipping
agency
pushed
back
this
week
on
any
phased
entry
for
tougher
marine
fuel
rules
and
further
tightened
regulations
that
will
come
into
force
in
the
international
maritime
organization
will
prohibit
ships
from
using
fuels
with
sulfur
content
above
percent
from
compared
with
percent
today
unless
they
are
equipped
with
scrubbers
to
clean
up
sulfur
emissions
ships
found
in
breach
of
the
new
rules
will
face
fines
or
the
risk
of
impoundment
by
imo
member
states
the
shipping
and
industries
are
scrambling
to
prepare
for
the
shift
and
have
made
large
investments
to
comply
with
the
new
standards
since
they
were
set
in
oil
companies
expect
a
jump
in
demand
for
cleaner
distillates
mainly
diesel
at
the
expense
of
fuel
oil
that
would
become
largely
redundant
last
week
washington
said
it
backed
a
of
the
rules
to
protect
consumers
from
any
price
spikes
in
heating
and
trucking
fuels
although
it
did
not
seek
a
delay
some
shipping
associations
together
with
the
bahamas
liberia
panama
and
the
marshall
islands
had
proposed
an
phase
which
gained
support
from
washington
leading
to
widespread
market
speculation
in
recent
days
about
a
possible
review
of
the
regulatory
time
frame
a
discussion
of
their
proposal
in
london
this
week
at
the
imo
s
marine
environment
protection
committee
mepc
failed
to
advance
after
the
chair
of
the
session
said
it
was
too
vague
the
paper
s
backers
were
told
they
could
submit
more
concrete
proposals
at
the
next
mepc
in
may
especially
focused
on
data
collection
and
fuel
oil
quality
that
time
frame
would
however
leave
little
time
realistically
before
the
regulations
kick
in
for
any
potential
review
the
imo
has
reiterated
that
there
will
be
no
delay
in
implementing
the
rules
a
coast
guard
official
said
on
thursday
that
washington
sought
a
pragmatic
approach
and
would
seek
to
develop
proposals
with
countries
for
the
may
meeting
some
analysts
including
rapidan
energy
group
have
suggested
that
major
stakeholders
including
flag
carriers
were
working
to
push
back
the
global
sulfur
ban
they
also
suggested
that
president
donald
trump
s
administration
was
likely
to
oppose
the
start
date
as
it
would
cause
a
significant
diesel
distillate
and
heating
oil
price
spike
in
the
winter
of
a
presidential
election
year
many
saw
mepc
as
the
last
chance
to
delay
or
soften
implementation
and
the
fact
that
both
proposals
were
rejected
strongly
suggests
that
imo
will
enter
the
market
as
expected
on
consultancy
jbc
energy
said
in
a
note
on
friday
the
imo
on
friday
adopted
a
ban
on
ships
carrying
marine
fuel
unless
they
have
special
equipment
on
board
further
tightening
regulations
this
latest
amendment
which
comes
into
force
on
march
makes
it
illegal
for
ships
to
carry
fuel
for
combustion
purposes
for
propulsion
or
operation
on
board
without
scrubbers
which
was
not
codified
in
the
main
regulation
the
amendment
does
not
change
in
any
way
the
entry
into
force
date
of
the
percent
limit
from
it
is
intended
as
an
additional
measure
to
support
consistent
implementation
and
compliance
and
provide
a
means
for
effective
enforcement
by
states
particularly
port
state
control
the
imo
said
on
friday
roger
strevens
chair
of
the
trident
alliance
a
coalition
of
shipping
companies
that
has
pushed
for
enforcement
of
the
sulfur
rules
said
friday
s
adoption
was
an
unmistakable
signal
of
the
imo
s
commitment
to
full
and
effective
implementation
the
focus
now
shifts
to
preparation
both
on
the
part
of
the
industry
and
of
the
enforcement
authorities
