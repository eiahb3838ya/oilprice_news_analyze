had
been
strongly
contested
by
the
movement
one
of
the
two
parties
in
the
ruling
coalition
it
s
no
longer
possible
to
intervene
in
this
project
which
was
planned
by
previous
governments
and
carries
contractual
constraints
conte
said
in
a
statement
interrupting
the
process
would
involve
unsustainable
costs
of
tens
of
billions
of
euros
he
said
adding
that
the
accords
signed
in
the
past
take
us
down
a
path

of
the
billion
southern
gas
corridor
that
will
bring
azeri
gas
to
italy
is
due
to
start
pumping
gas
in

local
opposition
to
the
project
has
raised
concern
that
work
at
the
italian
end
may
not
be
completed
in
time
the
billion
euro
billion
tap
is
viewed
as
strategic
by
the
european
union
as
it
moves
to
wean
itself
off
its
dependency
on
russian
gas
grassroots
opposition
revolved
around
alleged
environmental
risks
and
the
fear
the
pipeline
could
discourage
tourism
in
italy

where
it
is
due
to
arrive
after
crossing
the
adriatic
sea
ahead
of
an
election
in
march
the
movement
which
campaigns
on
an
environmentalist
platform
had
promised
to
halt
the
project
but
conte
said
this
was
no
longer
possible
we
have
done
everything
we
could
he
said
including
a
lengthy
analysis
but
now
the
time
has
come
to
take
the
necessary
earlier
on
friday
the
environment
ministry
said
it
had
found
no
legal
irregularities
in
the
pipeline
project
after
assessing
complaints
brought
by
the
local
community
at
a
meeting
with
president
donald
trump
in
washington
in
july
conte
said
he
was
aware
of
the
strategic
nature
of
the
pipeline
the

is
keen
to
see
the
project
completed
on
time
