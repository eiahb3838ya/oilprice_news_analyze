norway
s
sovereign
wealth
fund
the
world
s
largest
plans
to
more
than
double
its
investments
in
saudi
arabia
after
it
is
included
in
the
fund
s
reference
index
soon
chief
executive
yngve
slyngstad
said
on
friday
the
fund
currently
has
saudi
assets
worth
billion
crowns
million
spread
over
companies
including
banks
petrochemicals
and
healthcare
firms
the
fund
s
reference
index
the
ftse
will
include
saudi
arabia
in
the
coming
year
the
killing
of
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
after
he
entered
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
has
provoked
an
international
outcry
and
calls
for
trade
with
riyadh
to
be
limited
we
invest
in
companies
not
countries
our
investments
in
companies
based
in
saudi
arabia
will
not
be
changed
based
on
political
developments
slyngstad
told
reuters
generally
speaking
we
are
not
set
up
to
assess
political
earlier
the
billion
fund
said
it
would
ask
the
companies
in
which
it
invests
to
ensure
their
board
members
had
sufficient
expertise
time
and
independence
the
fund
which
funnels
norway
s
revenues
from
oil
and
gas
production
owns
percent
of
all
globally
listed
shares
it
has
in
recent
years
become
a
more
active
shareholder
as
it
has
grown
in
heft
while
some
of
the
demands
put
forward
on
friday
are
not
new
for
the
fund
such
as
opposing
ceos
who
sit
as
chairs
of
their
companies
others
are
such
as
requiring
industry
expertise
from
directors
a
majority
of
independent
board
members
should
have
fundamental
industry
insight
and
at
least
two
of
the
independent
members
should
have
worked
in
the
company
s
industry
said
the
fund
it
is
really
industry
expertise
which
is
an
issue
that
has
been
from
investors
said
slyngstad
the
strong
desire
to
have
a
profitable
company
by
having
a
board
who
knows
the
he
declined
to
name
specific
sectors
where
he
thought
board
industry
expertise
was
lacking
but
said
there
has
been
a
focus
on
the
financial
sector
also
from
regulators
which
we
will
reinforce
from
our
point
of
view
but
this
is
a
broader
issue
than
just
the
financial
sector
he
added
we
have
seen
quite
differing
practice
in
different
sectors
and
different
countries
this
is
a
signal
that
we
will
try
to
look
at
these
issues
more
quantitatively
to
see
where
we
can
find
the
major
issues
with
regards
to
countries
and
the
position
papers
will
form
the
basis
of
the
fund
s
position
for
how
it
votes
on
the
boards
of
companies
it
will
be
a
starting
point
for
how
we
will
vote
chief
corporate
governance
officer
carine
smith
ihenacho
told
reporters
earlier
asked
whether
the
fund
would
divest
from
reluctant
companies
on
these
issues
she
said
it
will
be
a
basis
for
voting
dialogue
and
directors
should
also
ensure
they
have
enough
time
to
fulfil
their
obligations
to
the
boards
on
which
they
serve
said
the
fund
in
practice
that
means
board
members
of
listed
companies
should
not
serve
on
more
than
five
boards
at
one
time
and
the
chair
of
a
leading
company
should
generally
not
chair
the
board
of
another
company
it
said
in
the
third
quarter
the
fund
made
a
return
of
percent
helped
by
rising
north
american
stocks
it
still
returned
percentage
points
less
than
the
a
benchmark
index
set
by
the
norwegian
finance
ministry
the
market
development
was
affected
by
expectations
of
differing
economic
growth
and
uncertainty
about
the
effects
of
increased
trade
barriers
