have
teamed
up
with
three
families
to
sue
the
german
government
with
the
aim
of
forcing
it
to
meet
climate
protection
goals
earlier
than
it
had
planned
magazine
der

reported
on
friday
the
case
brought
by
greenpeace
on
behalf
of
the
three
german
families
alleges
that
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
government
by
failing
to
tackle
climate
change
with
sufficient
urgency
was
infringing
their
right
to
life
and
health
the
filing
mirrors
a
recent
case
in
the
netherlands
where
an
appeals
court
handed
down
a
binding
ruling
ordering
the
hague
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
faster
than
planned
the
dutch
government
said
it
would
abide
by
the
ruling
in
berlin
committed
to
cutting
emissions
of
greenhouses
gases
by
percent
from
their
levels
by
the
end
of
this
decade
but
the
latest
government
program
says
the
goal
will
be
met
only
to
the
extent
possible
with
a
percent
cut
thought
an

the
government
has
simply
abandoned
their
goal

say
their
farms
and

with
pest
attacks
harvest
failures
and
in
their
livestock
costing
them
and
their
children

according
to
their
claim
this
further
infringes
their
freedom
to
exercise
a
profession
as
well
as
their
property
rights
we
can
no
longer
accept
the
inaction
of
the

peters
told
the
magazine
especially
when
it
would
be
possible
to
achieve
