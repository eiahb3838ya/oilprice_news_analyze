adds
to
the
myriad
of
negative
factors
roiling
investors
analysts
at
capital
economics
sounded
a
cautious
note
suggesting
that
the
bounce
in
the
s
p
index
on
thursday
was
only
temporary
as
investors
worries
about
the
economic
outlook
worsen
the
first
and
most
important
worry
is
that
fed
tightening
and
fading
fiscal
stimulus
will
cause
the
us
economy
to
take
a
turn
for
the
worse
the
second
is
that
china
s
economy
will
continue
to
struggle
the
analysts
said
in
a
note
to
clients
as
we
have
been
arguing
for
a
while
now
these
worries
are
likely
to
get
worse
over
the
next
twelve
months

investors
will
get
a
chance
to
check
the
economic
pulse

data
as
suggesting
that
investment
is
not
taking
off
even
with
the
apparent
tailwind

cuts

this
indicates
that
the
boost
to
gdp
growth
from
the

stimulus
could
be
fairly
transitory
