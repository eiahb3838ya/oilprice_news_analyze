country
where
despite

for
himself
on
based

s
figures
and
in
recent
days
police
silenced
opposition
marches
in
the
port
city
of
douala
where
he
is
popular
we
solemnly
and
categorically
reject

we
will
use
all
means
of

to
restore
the
truth
of
the

also
rejected
the

saying
they
did
not
reflect
reality
in
cameroon
authorities
have
defended
the
voting
process
the
election
was
free
fair
and
credible
in
spite
of
the
security
challenges
in
the
regions
the
president
of
constitutional
council
clement
atangana
said
on
monday
the
secessionist
movement
began
in
reaction
to
a
government
clampdown
on
peaceful
protests
calling
for
an
end
to
the
marginalisation
of
cameroon
s
minority
police
killed

sparking
further
protests
the

burned
villages
and
killed
unarmed
civilians
residents
told

forcing
thousands
to
flee
to
regions
or
neighbouring
nigeria
ghost
towns
are
all
that
remain
of
once
vibrant
cities
in
those
regions
turnout
was
percent
in
the
northwest
and
percent
in
the
southwest
in
an
area
of
million
english
speakers
less
than
voted
despite
the
unrest
and
a
desire
among
the
young
for
change
the
opposition
appeared
unable
to
mount
a
credible
challenge
to
biya
who
despite
long
absences
in
switzerland
has
kept
core
support
he
has
also
benefited
from
apathy
from
many
who
saw
no
point
in
voting
i
voted
for
the
opposition
even
though
i
did
not
trust
them
i
wanted
anything
but

unemployed
my
three
children
will
have
no
future
as
long
as
he
is
the
only
current

president
to
have
ruled
longer
