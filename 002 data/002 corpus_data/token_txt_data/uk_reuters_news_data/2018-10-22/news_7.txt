new
york
reuters
oil
futures
were
little
changed
on
monday
after
paring
earlier
losses
despite
saudi
arabia
s
pledge
to
raise
crude
production
to
a
record
high
two
weeks
before
sanctions
potentially
choke
off
iranian
supplies
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
told
russia
s
tass
news
agency
that
his
country
had
no
intention
of
unleashing
a
oil
embargo
on
western
consumers
but
rather
was
focused
on
raising
output
to
compensate
for
supply
losses
elsewhere
such
as
iran
falih
said
saudi
arabia
would
soon
raise
output
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
from
the
current
million
he
added
that
riyadh
had
capacity
to
increase
production
to
million
bpd
oil
prices
are
finely
balanced
in
today
s
trading
session
despite
the
saudi
pledge
to
boost
production
it
is
still
not
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
kingdom
s
production
increase
will
be
enough
to
compensate
for
the
potential
output
loss
from
iran
and
venezuela

for

also
rose

to

several

have
suggested
imposing
sanctions
on
saudi

over
the
killing
of

jamal
khashoggi
the
kingdom
the
world
s
largest
oil
exporter
pledged
to
retaliate
against
any
sanctions
with
bigger
the
white
house
s
dithering
highlights
the
unwillingness
of
the
trump
administration
to
take
any
meaningful
action
against
riyadh
just
a
few
weeks
prior
to
the
iran
sanctions
coming
into
play
said
fiona
cincotta
senior

analyst
at

firm
gain
capital
in
a
note
a
veiled
threat
of
using
oil
as
a
weapon
is
essentially
tying
hands
investors
are
watching
and
waiting
for
the
next
chapter
before
positioning
themselves
accordingly
cincotta
said
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
sector
start
on
and
analysts
believe
up
to
million
bpd
in
supply
could
be
at
risk
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
agreed
in
june
to
boost
supply
to
make
up
for
the
expected
disruption
to
iranian
exports
an
internal
document
reviewed
by
reuters
suggested
opec
is
struggling
to
add
barrels
as
an
increase
in
saudi
supply
was
offset
by
declines
elsewhere
including
iran
and
venezuela
the
outlook
for
demand
next
year
meanwhile
is
deteriorating
opec
estimates
demand
for
its
crude
will
fall
to
an
average
of
million
bpd
next
year
from
an
average
million
bpd
this
year
