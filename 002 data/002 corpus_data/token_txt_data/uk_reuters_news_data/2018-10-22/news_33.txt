saudi
arabia
on
sunday
called
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
its
istanbul
consulate
a
huge
and
grave
mistake
but
sought
to
shield
its
powerful
crown
prince
from
the
widening
crisis
saying
mohammed
bin
salman
had
not
been
aware
the
comments
from
foreign
minister
adel
were
some
of
the
most
direct
yet
from
riyadh
which
has
given
multiple
and
conflicting
accounts
about
khashoggi
s
killing
on
first
denying
his
death
and
later
admitting
it
amid
an
international
outcry
this
was
an
operation
that
was
a
rogue
operation
this
was
an
operation
where
individuals
ended
up
exceeding
the
authorities
and
responsibilities
they
had
jubeir
said
on
the
broadcaster
fox
they
made
the
mistake
when
they
killed
jamal
khashoggi
in
the
consulate
and
they
tried
to
cover
up
for
it
he
said
the
weeks
of
denial
and
lack
of
credible
evidence
in
the
face
of
allegations
from
turkish
officials
that
khashoggi
had
been
killed
have
shaken
global
confidence
in
ties
with
the
world
s
top
oil
exporter
treasury
secretary
stephen
mnuchin
said
saudi
arabia
s
admission
that
the
washington
post
columnist
was
killed
in
a
fistfight
was
a
good
first
step
but
not
enough
though
he
added
it
was
premature
to
discuss
sanctions
against
riyadh
three
european
powers
germany
britain
and
france
pressed
riyadh
to
provide
facts
and
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
germany
would
not
export
arms
to
saudi
arabia
while
uncertainty
over
khashoggi
s
fate
persisted
late
on
sunday
the
saudi
press
agency
said
both
saudi
king
salman
and
prince
mohammed
had
called
khashoggi
s
son
salah
to
express
condolences
jubeir
had
extended
condolences
to
khashoggi
s
family
earlier
on
sunday
unfortunately
a
huge
and
grave
mistake
was
made
and
i
assure
them
that
those
responsible
will
be
held
accountable
for
this
he
told
fox
jubeir
said
the
saudis
did
not
know
how
khashoggi
a
saudi
national
and
resident
had
been
killed
or
where
his
body
was
he
also
said
prince
mohammed
was
not
responsible
khashoggi
vanished
after
entering
the
consulate
to
obtain
documents
for
his
upcoming
marriage
after
two
weeks
denying
any
involvement
in
the
s
disappearance
saudi
arabia
on
saturday
said
khashoggi
a
critic
of
the
crown
prince
died
during
a
fight
in
the
building
an
hour
later
another
saudi
official
attributed
the
death
to
a
chokehold
nothing
can
justify
this
killing
and
we
condemn
it
in
the
strongest
possible
terms
germany
britain
and
france
said
in
their
joint
statement
there
remains
an
urgent
need
for
clarification
of
exactly
what
happened
beyond
the
hypotheses
that
have
been
raised
so
far
in
the
saudi
investigation
which
need
to
be
backed
by
facts
to
be
considered
the
white
house
said
late
on
sunday
that
president
donald
trump
had
spoken
to
french
president
emmanuel
macron
and
the
two
had
discussed
a
range
of
issues
including
circumstances
surrounding
khashoggi
s
death
reflecting
international
scepticism
over
its
account
a
senior
saudi
government
official
laid
out
a
new
version
that
contradicts
previous
explanations
the
latest
account
includes
details
on
how
saudis
sent
to
confront
khashoggi
had
threatened
him
with
being
drugged
and
kidnapped
and
killed
him
in
a
chokehold
when
he
resisted
a
member
of
the
team
dressed
in
khashoggi
s
clothes
to
make
it
appear
as
if
he
had
left
the
consulate
turkish
officials
suspect
khashoggi
was
killed
inside
the
consulate
by
the
saudi
agents
and
his
body
cut
up
turkish
sources
say
authorities
have
an
audio
recording
purportedly
documenting
khashoggi
s
murder
in
a
speech
on
sunday
turkish
president
recep
tayyip
erdogan
appeared
to
suggest
he
was
getting
ready
to
release
some
information
about
the
turkish
investigation
and
would
do
so
at
his
weekly
speech
on
tuesday
to
members
of
his
ruling
ak
party
erdogan
has
remained
largely
silent
on
the
case
although
turkey
s
newspapers
have
released
information
about
events
at
the
consulate
turkey
s
anadolu
agency
said
early
on
monday
that
erdogan
and
trump
had
spoken
on
the
telephone
and
agreed
that
all
aspects
of
the
case
needed
to
be
cleared
up
for
saudi
arabia
s
allies
particularly
in
the
west
the
question
will
be
whether
they
believe
that
the
prince
who
has
painted
himself
as
a
reformer
has
any
culpability
king
salman
has
handed
the
running
of
saudi
arabia
to
him
i
am
not
satisfied
until
we
find
the
answer
but
it
was
a
big
first
step
it
was
a
good
first
step
but
i
want
to
get
to
the
answer
trump
told
reporters
this
weekend
when
asked
about
the
saudi
investigation
and
riyadh
s
firing
of
officials
in
an
interview
with
the
washington
post
trump
said
that
obviously
there
s
been
deception
and
there
s
been
he
had
suggested
last
week
that
rogue
killers
might
have
been
responsible
for
khashoggi
s
death
a
comment
critics
called
an
effort
to
play
down
the
crisis
a
leading
republican
senator
said
he
believed
the
crown
prince
was
behind
the
killing
adding
that
the
saudis
had
lost
credibility
in
their
explanations
of
his
death
yes
i
think
he
did
it
