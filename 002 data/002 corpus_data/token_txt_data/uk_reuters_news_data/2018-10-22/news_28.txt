u.s. midwest refiners look like earnings winners in q3
new

reuters
refiners
are
expected
to
post
strong
earnings
for
the
third
quarter
with
midwest
producers
leading
the
way
thanks
to
cheaper
prices
for
canadian
crude
that
pushed
down
input
costs
independent
refiners
benefited
from
a
steep
discount
for
crude
oil
below
the
price
of
global
benchmark
brent
a
further
discount
on
oil
out
of
midland
texas
may
have
also
helped
though
that
discount
declined
in
the
most
recent
quarter
because
of
transportation
constraints
canada
s
oil
has
a
steeper
discount
than
crude
and
analysts
believe
this
should
benefit
refiners
situated
in
the
midwest
that
process
a
higher
volume
of
that
country
s
crude
than
those
on
the
gulf
coast
until
you
see
adequate
relief
up
in
west
canada
we
think
the
number
one
region
for
refining
economics
in
the
will
continue
to
be

canadian

totaled

most
on

to
post
strong
results
rogers
said
most
refiners
benefited
from
sharp
declines
in
the
midland
grade
which
in
august
hit
its
widest
discount
to
crude
in
six
years
since
then
however
that
midland
differential
has
narrowed
and
margins
for
gasoline
known
as
the
crack
spread
have
since
declined
that
tempered
some
analysts
projections
for
earnings
i
don
t
think
our
outlook
for
refiners
is
as
strong
as
it
would
have
been
days
ago

an

analyst
at
tortoise

refiners
with
exposure
to
the
differential
such
as
delek
us
holdings
inc
may
see
less
of
a
benefit
holmes
said
since
nine
analysts
have
lowered
expectations
for
delek

earnings

heading
