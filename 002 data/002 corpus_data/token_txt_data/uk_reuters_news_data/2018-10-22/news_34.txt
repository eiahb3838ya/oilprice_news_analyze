sanctions

while
the
organization
of
the

countries
opec
agreed
in
june
to
boost
supply
to
make
up
for
expected
iran
disruptions
an
internal
document
reviewed
by
reuters
suggested
that
opec
is
struggling
to
add
barrels
to
the
market
as
an
increase
in
saudi
arabian
supply
was
offset
by
declines
in
iran
venezuela
and
angola
traders
said
major
oil
consumers
were
stockpiling
in
anticipation
of
more
disruptions
in
china
higher
seasonal
demand
and
suspected
stockpiling
are
occurring
while
similarly
the
and
the
oecd
continue
building
stockpiles
ahead
of
potential
supply
disruptions
this
winter
said
stephen
innes
head
of
trading
for
at
futures
brokerage
oanda
in
singapore
despite
this
innes
said
overall
global
oil
supply
was
currently
enough
to
meet
demand
while
the
equilibrium
remains
fragile
brent
remains
in
good
supply
despite
growing
uncertainty
about
supply
disruptions
he
said
there
were
also
some
signs
of
rising
output
especially
in
north
america
drillers
added
four
oil
rigs
in
the
week
to
bringing
the
total
count
to
baker
hughes
energy
services
firm
said
on
friday
raising
the
rig
count
to
the
highest
level
since
march
the
rig
count
is
an
early
indicator
of
future
output
with
activity
rising
again
after
months
of
stagnation
crude
production
is
also
expected
to
continue
to
rise
looking
further
out
concern
that
the
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
would
crimp
economic
growth
may
weigh
on
the
outlook
for
oil
prices
the
full
impact
of
the
trade
war
will
hit
markets
in
and
could
act
as
a
considerable
drag
on
oil
demand
next
year
raising
the
possibility
of
the
market
returning
to
surplus
