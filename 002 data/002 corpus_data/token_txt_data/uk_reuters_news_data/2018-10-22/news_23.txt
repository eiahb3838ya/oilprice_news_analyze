saudi
arabia
has
no
intention
of
unleashing
a
oil
embargo
on
western
consumers
and
will
isolate
oil
from
politics
the
saudi
energy
minister
said
on
monday
amid
a
worsening
crisis
over
the
killing
of
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
there
is
no
intention
khalid
told
russia
s
tass
news
agency
when
asked
whether
there
could
be
a
repeat
of
the
oil
embargo
top
lawmakers
turned
their
ire
on
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
on
sunday
and
said
they
believed
he
ordered
the
killing
of
khashoggi
although
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
maintained
a
more
cautious
stance
several
lawmakers
have
suggested
imposing
sanctions
on
saudi
arabia
in
recent
days
while
the
kingdom
the
world
s
largest
oil
exporter
has
pledged
to
retaliate
against
any
sanctions
with
bigger
measures
this
incident
will
pass
but
saudi
arabia
is
a
very
responsible
country
for
decades
we
used
our
oil
policy
as
a
responsible
economic
tool
and
isolated
it
from
politics
falih
said
my
role
as
the
energy
minister
is
to
implement
my
government
s
constructive
and
responsible
role
and
stabilizing
the
world
s
energy
markets
accordingly
contributing
to
global
economic
development
falih
said
he
said
that
if
oil
prices
went
up
it
would
slow
the
global
economy
and
trigger
a
recession
in
a
column
published
last
week
al
arabiya
channel
s
general
manager
turki
aldakhil
warned
that
imposing
sanctions
on
riyadh
could
spark
global
economic
disaster
as
oil
could
jump
to
per
barrel
the
oil
crisis
began
when
arab
producers
led
by
saudi
arabia
slapped
an
oil
embargo
on
western
supporters
of
israel
in
its
war
with
egypt
targeting
canada
japan
the
netherlands
britain
and
the
united
states
oil
prices
spiked
on
the
move
as
they
did
later
in
because
of
the
iranian
revolution
the
efficiency
of
the
embargo
was
far
from
obvious
as
higher
prices
led
to
the
development
of
new
oil
provinces
outside
the
middle
east
and
encouraged
alternative
energy
riyadh
has
refrained
from
using
oil
as
a
direct
weapon
since
then
if
oil
prices
will
go
too
high
it
will
slow
down
the
world
economy
and
would
trigger
a
global
recession
and
saudi
arabia
has
been
consistent
in
its
policy
we
work
to
stabilize
global
markets
and
facilitate
global
economic
growth
that
policy
has
been
consistent
for
many
years
falih
said
more
falih
said
that
with
sanctions
on
iran
coming
into
full
force
next
month
there
was
no
guarantee
oil
prices
would
refrain
from
going
higher
i
can
not
give
you
a
guarantee
because
i
can
not
predict
what
will
happen
to
other
suppliers
falih
said
when
asked
whether
the
world
can
avoid
oil
hitting
per
barrel
again
we
have
sanctions
on
iran
and
nobody
has
a
clue
what
iranians
exports
will
be
secondly
there
are
potential
declines
in
different
countries
like
libya
nigeria
mexico
and
venezuela
he
said
if
million
barrels
per
day
disappears
we
can
not
cover
this
volume
so
we
have
to
use
oil
reserves
he
said
falih
said
saudi
arabia
would
soon
raise
output
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
from
the
current
million
he
added
that
riyadh
had
capacity
to
increase
output
to
million
bpd
and
its
gulf
opec
ally
the
united
arab
emirates
could
add
another
million
bpd
we
have
relatively
limited
spare
capacities
and
we
are
using
a
significant
part
of
them
he
said
global
supply
next
year
could
be
helped
by
brazil
kazakhstan
and
the
united
states
he
added
but
if
you
have
other
countries
to
decline
in
addition
to
the
full
application
of
iran
sanctions
then
we
will
be
pulling
all
spare
capacities
