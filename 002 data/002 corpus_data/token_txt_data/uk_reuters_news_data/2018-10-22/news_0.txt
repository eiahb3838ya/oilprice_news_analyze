paris
reuters
total
s
chief
executive
said
on
monday
he
would
attend
an
investment
conference
in
saudi
arabia
this
week
despite
rising
pressure
on
business
leaders
to
drop
out
after
riyadh
admitted
a
journalist
was
killed
at
its
istanbul
consulate
saudi
arabia
has
drawn
strong
international
criticism
after
saying
that
jamal
khashoggi
a
prominent
critic
of
saudi
rulers
was
killed
inside
the
consulate
after
two
weeks
of
denials
that
it
had
anything
to
do
with
his
disappearance
i
am
convinced
that
an
empty
chairs
at
the
table
strategy
serves
no
useful
purpose
especially
when
it
comes
to
respect
for
human
rights

ceo
patrick

said
in
a
statement
the
french
oil
major
s
decision
comes
despite
president
emmanuel
macron
s
decision
last
week
to
pull
his
finance
minister
out
of
the
future
investment
initiative
conference
it
contrasts
with
the
decision
of
siemens
ceo
not
to
attend
the
conference
another
french
energy
company
edf
said
late
on
monday
its
ceo
would
not
attend
the
conference
citing
a
conflicting
meeting
in
paris
total
and
saudi
aramco

of
the
largest
refining
facilities
in
the
world
the
satorp

edf
hopes
to
sell
a
nuclear
plant
in
saudi
arabia
and
has
submitted
a
bid
in
a
saudi
tender
for
the
project
along
with
several
other
nuclear
vendors
paris
and
riyadh
enjoy
close
diplomatic
and
commercial
relations
spanning
energy
finance
and
weapons
but
france
which
considers
riyadh
a
bulwark
against
iranian
influence
in
the
middle
east
now
faces
a
delicate
balancing
act
in
its
response
to
the
incident
macron
has
sought
to
downplay
the
importance
of
trade
relations
with
riyadh
saying
that
saudi
arabia
was
not
a
major
client
of
france
although
from
it
was
the
second
biggest
purchaser
