birol
said
on
monday
he
is
not
worried
saudi
arabia
will
cut
oil
supply
in
response
to
any
potential
sanctions
over
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
but
urged
common
sense
as
political
developments
may
impact
energy
markets
there
are
many
geopolitical
related
issues
which
could
also
have
further
impact
on
the
oil
markets
birol
told
reuters
when
asked
about
concerns
in
oil
markets
over
whether
saudi
arabia
the
world
s
biggest
crude
oil
exporter
might
retaliate
against
any
punitive
measures
by
global
powers
over
khashoggi
s
death
in
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
there
s
a
strong
challenge
for
the
key
producers
to
increase
production
and
comfort
the
markets
i
appeal
to
all
the
producers
and
consumers
to
have
common
sense
in
the
very
difficult
months
we
are
entering
birol
said
speaking
on
the
sidelines
of
an
lng
conference
in
nagoya
japan
he
said
he
did
not
think
that
saudi
arabia
would
cut
production
but
he
has
significant
worries
about
the
market
because
of
falling
supply
from
venezuela
and
iran
amid
strong
demand
growth
amid
that
equation
birol
said
there
is
potential
we
will
see
even
higher
prices
than
current
ones
and
it
comes
as
it
always
does
at
a
bad
time
for
the
global
saudi
arabia
on
sunday
called
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
its
istanbul
consulate
a
huge
and
grave
mistake
but
sought
to
shield
its
powerful
crown
prince
from
the
widening
crisis
saying
mohammed
bin
salman
had
not
been
aware
the
comments
from
foreign
minister
adel
were
some
of
the
most
direct
yet
from
riyadh
which
has
given
multiple
and
conflicting
accounts
about
khashoggi
s
killing
on
first
denying
his
death
and
later
admitting
it
amid
an
international
outcry
