column-china's winter pollution cuts may boost high-grade iron ore: russell

with
china
s
restrictions
starting
to
take
effect
one
of
the
conventional
market
wisdoms
is
that
this
will
boost
demand
for
iron
ore
the
logic
is
sound
if
steel
mills
are
restricted
as
to
how
much
they
can
pollute
they
will
use
the
best
possible
quality
iron
ore
in
order
to
maximise
the
amount
of
steel
produced
relative
to
the
energy
consumed
this
means
that
ore
with
an
iron
content
of
percent
or
higher
should
command
a
greater
period
during
the
winter
restriction
period
than
those
poorer
quality
grades
such
as
percent
it
s
still
not
absolutely
certain
how
much
iron
ore
capacity
will
be
idled
or
forced
to
run
at
lower
production
rates
over
the
winter
period
as
part
of
efforts
to
limit
air
pollution
from
burning
coal
this
time
around
beijing
has
allowed
local
authorities
to
set
their
own
measures
changing
from
last
winter
s
policy
of
imposing
blanket
cuts
on
certain
regions
this
had
made
it
more
difficult
to
work
out
precisely
how
much
steel
capacity
may
be
cut
and
how
many
tonnes
of
production
may
be
lost
some
areas
such
as
top
producer
tangshan
appeared
to
have
imposed
less
stringent
measures
but
have
made
them
last
for
longer
this
time
to
the
end
of
march
as
opposed
to
the
middle
of
march
in
this
year
s
curbs
analysts
at
barclays
bank
said
in
a
research
note
on
that
the
longer
period
will
outweigh
the
more
lenient
capacity
reductions
resulting
in
the
loss
of
million
tonnes
this
winter
from
tangshan
compared
to
million
tonnes
the
previous
winter
the
output
restrictions
will
also
apply
to
more
regions
than
last
year
raising
the
possibility
that
steel
output
will
decline
over
the
winter
period
this
didn
t
happen
last
winter
as
mills
in
areas
not
subject
to
restrictions
were
able
to
increase
output
by
more
than
the
volume
lost
by
plants
subject
to
pollution
controls
whatever
ends
up
being
the
case
the
likelihood
is
that
steel
mills
will
seek
to
use
iron
ore
in
order
to
produce
the
most
amount
of
steel
from
whatever
capacity
they
are
allowed
to
use
this
should
boost
demand
for
iron
ore
although
this
dynamic
has
yet
to
show
up
in
pricing
iron
ore
for
china
delivery
with
a
iron
content
as
assessed
by
argus
media
ended
last
week
at
a
tonne
while
ore
was
and
was
this
put
the
ore
at
a
premium
of
percent
to
and
at
a
premium
of
percent
to
the
grade
that
may
seem
like
quite
substantial
but
it
s
not
far
off
the
percent
commanded
by
the
ire
over
the
at
the
end
of
october
last
year
and
the
percent
premium
over
interestingly
last
winter
the
premium
didn
t
actually
widen
over
the
season
it
narrowed
with
ore
ending
february
just
percent
above
grade
ore
and
percent
higher
than
that
would
seem
to
fly
in
the
face
of
the
market
view
that
winter
should
lead
to
stronger
demand
for
ore
given
that
the
last
year
the
poorer
quality
grades
actually
closed
the
gap
on
the
ore
however
the
explanation
is
likely
that
steel
mills
outside
the
pollution
control
areas
took
advantage
of
the
wide
discount
for
ore
at
the
start
of
winter
and
bought
cargoes
of
the
cheaper
supplies
this
winter
the
dynamics
may
end
being
slightly
different
given
the
likely
wider
application
of
measures
certainly
there
is
some
evidence
to
suggest
that
ores
such
as
those
supplied
by
brazil
s
vale
are
seeing
increasing
demand
and
port
data
compiled
by
refinitiv
suggests
that
china
may
import
as
much
as
million
tonnes
from
brazil
this
month
that
would
be
the
strongest
monthly
result
since
the
data
series
began
in
while
this
data
is
subject
to
revision
due
to
the
timing
of
vessels
arriving
and
discharging
their
cargoes
it
still
points
to
strong
chinese
demand
for
iron
ore

opinions
expressed
here
are
