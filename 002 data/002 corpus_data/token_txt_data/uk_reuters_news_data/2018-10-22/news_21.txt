iranian
oil
output
can
not
be
replaced
by
other
oil
producing
countries
if
tehran
is
hit
by
sanctions
in
november
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
told
the
ministry
s
website
shana
on
monday
as
i
have
repeatedly
said
there
is
no
replacement
for
iranian
oil
in
the
market
saudi
arabia
and
russia
s
output
is
near
their
highest
level
ever
and
they
have
no
spare
capacity
to
pump
more
to
replace
iran
s
oil
he
told
shana
in
may
president
donald
trump
pulled
out
of
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
and
announced
sanctions
against
opec
s
producer
iran
washington
is
pushing
allies
to
cut
imports
of
iranian
oil
to
zero
and
will
reimpose
sanctions
on
iranian
oil
and
financial
sectors
in
november
it
is
also
encouraging
other
oil
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
other
opec
members
and
russia
to
pump
more
to
meet
any
shortfall
iran
s
regional
rival
saudi
arabia
says
riyadh
has
capacity
to
increase
output
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
from
the
current
million
bpd
opec
agreed
in
june
to
boost
supply
to
make
up
for
the
expected
disruption
to
iranian
exports
but
iran
has
repeatedly
said
that
its
oil
exports
can
not
be
reduced
to
zero
because
of
high
demand
levels
in
the
market
under
sanctions
iran
s
oil
exports
could
fall
by
as
much
as
straining
oil
markets
the
market
s
knowledge
of
this
inability
has
raised
the
prices
as
the
average
price
of
crude
rising
oil
prices
have
slowed
down
the
economic
growth
of
most
of
the
consumer
countries
which
is
affecting
the
global
economy
he
said
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
in
an
interview
with
reuters
on
sunday
dismissed
concerns
that
oil
prices
could
rise
saying
the
market
had
already
factored
in
the
losses
zanganeh
advised
trump
to
forgo
imposition
of
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
exports
saying
that
the
producers
of
oil
were
also
unable
to
offset
disruptions
in
the
market
iran
has
warned
that
if
it
can
not
sell
its
oil
due
to
pressure
then
no
other
regional
country
will
be
allowed
to
do
so
either
threatening
to
block
the
strait
of
hormuz
under
the
nuclear
deal
most
international
sanctions
against
tehran
were
lifted
in
in
exchange
for
iran
curbing
its
nuclear
programme
