the
united
states
has
adopted
an
escalate
to
negotiate
strategy
towards
china
threatening
a
dramatic
hike
in
tariffs
to
try
to
force
a
resumption
of
trade
talks
while
the
economy
remains
strong
and
as
elections
approach
in
november
president
donald
trump
has
reportedly
rejected
a
plan
to
levy
tariffs
of
percent
on
an
additional
billion
of
imports
from
china
and
ordered
aides
to
prepare
a
proposal
for
tariffs
at
the
higher
rate
of
percent
the
levies
are
in
addition
to
the
tariffs
on
billion
of
imports
that
have
already
gone
into
effect
and
the
billion
of
tariffs
announced
but
not
yet
implemented
the
administration
s
approach
to
china
is
the
same
one
it
has
employed
in
dealing
with
north
korea
iran
the
european
union
and
nafta
partners
the
basic
strategy
including
the
risks
and
opportunities
will
be
familiar
to
anyone
who
has
studied
the
cold

the
administration
s
decision
to
escalate
the
confrontation
dramatically
at
this
point
threatening
significant
tariffs
on
a
wide
range
of
imports
including
consumer
items
is
likely
to
stem
from
a
combination
of
strength
and
fear
so
far
the
trade
war
appears
to
have
hit
china
s
economy
and
financial
markets
harder
than
the
united
states
which
has
given
the
administration
confidence
that
it
is
escalating
from
a
position
of
strength
the
s
equity
index
is
up
by
more
than
percent
since
the
start
of
and
percent
since
the
start
of
while
china
s
shanghai
composite
index
has
fallen
by
percent
and
percent
respectively
the
dollar
has
strengthened
by
percent
against
china
s
yuan
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
and
has
risen
by
around
percent
on
a
basis
against
the
currencies
of
other
major
trading
partners
china
s
economy
has
shown
signs
of
slowing
with
the
central
government
resorting
to
fiscal
and
monetary
stimulus
to
offset
the
slowdown
in
external
demand
and
boost
confidence
in
contrast
the
economy
expanded
at
an
annualised
rate
of
percent
in
the
second
quarter
the
fastest
for
almost
four
years
according
to
advance
estimates
manufacturers
have
reported
a
upturn
in
business
activity
in
recent
months
while
consumer
confidence
is
close
to
highs
the
asymmetric
economic
and
financial
performance
of
the
united
states
and
china
has
convinced
the
white
house
it
has
escalation
dominance
and
should
press
home
its
advantage
the
white
house
strategy
has
been
to
escalate
secure
in
the
belief
china
has
more
to
lose
than
the
united
states
on
each
of
the
next
few
rungs
up
the
escalation
ladder
until
now
china
has
matched
tariff
moves
but
not
sought
to
escalate
them
which
has
also
probably
also
emboldened
the
white
house
to
think
it
holds
a
stronger
position
on
the
escalation
ladder
but
if
the
white
house
thinks
it
is
escalating
from
a
position
of
strength
it
probably
also
fears
strength
may
not
last
forever
and
could
diminish
the
longer
the
conflict
lasts
rapid
gdp
growth
in
the
second
quarter
was
mostly
the
result
of
tax
cuts
which
stimulated
consumer
spending
as
well
as
a
race
to
export
soybeans
and
beat
the
tariffs
growth
in
the
third
and
fourth
quarters
is
likely
to
be
slower
as
these
temporary
effects
unwind
and
the
baseline
for
comparisons
becomes
more
challenging
economic
expansions
tend
to
be
cyclical
and
even
within
each
expansion
there
are
spurts
of
rapid
growth
followed
by
more
sluggish
intervals
so
the
administration
can
not
count
on
the
recent
spurt
to
be
sustained
businesses
are
already
starting
to
report
widespread
increases
in
input
costs
in
part
as
a
result
of
steel
and
aluminium
tariffs
consumer
price
inflation
is
also
rising
and
starting
to
erode
the
real
value
of
wage
rises
so
far
the
administration
has
tried
to
avoid
imposing
tariffs
on
consumer
items
in
order
to
avoid
politically
controversial
price
rises
at
retail
level
but
if
the
united
states
is
forced
to
carry
out
its
threat
and
actually
imposes
percent
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
additional
items
from
china
hitting
consumer
goods
will
become
inevitable
until
now
senior
administration
officials
have
made
great
efforts
to
reassure
investors
and
businesses
that
a
tariffs
are
unlikely
to
be
imposed
b
even
if
imposed
the
economic
impact
will
be
small
c
the
economy
is
strong
enough
to
weather
any
hit
and
d
the
pain
is
worth
the
gains
from
resetting
relations
with
china
if
the
white
house
is
forced
to
carry
out
its
threat
to
extend
percent
tariffs
to
a
much
wider
range
of
items
however
the
fallout
will
be
greater
and
pose
a
more
serious
test
of
resolve
for
investors
and
businesses
part
of
the
strategy
seems
to
be
to
intensify
the
pressure
on
china
quickly
through
rapid
escalation
in
the
hope
it
will
force
an
early
restart
of
negotiations
on
advantageous
terms
and
permit
quickly
before
the
economic
damage
becomes
too
great
if
the
white
house
can
secure
an
early
resumption
of
negotiations
or
an
early
settlement
even
a
partial
one
it
will
feature
heavily
in
the
political
campaign
ahead
of
congressional
elections
as
a
successful
example
of
the
president
s
tough
negotiating
style
the
administration
therefore
has
a
strong
incentive
to
escalate
quickly
in
the
hope
of
forcing
a
favourable
outcome
well
before
the
country
goes
to
the
polls
in
november
for
the
white
house
the
economic
and
political
cycles
favour
rapid
escalation
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
claim
an
equally
quick
victory
before
the
costs
start
to
rise
by
bringing
the
conflict
to
a
crisis
in
the
greek
sense
of
a
moment
of
decision
the
administration
hopes
to
end
the
dispute
or
at
least
before
the
damage
grows
china
s
reaction
remains
uncertain
however
which
introduces
a
dangerous
element
into
the
escalation
strategy
and
means
it
could
backfire
china
s
economy
is
under
greater
pressure
in
the
short
term
but
its
policymakers
may
conclude
that
it
is
better
to
absorb
the
costs
and
wait
for
the
pressure
to
start
to
mount
on
the
united
states
in
the
end
tariffs
are
a
tax
on
consumers
and
if
high
tariffs
go
into
effect
on
consumer
items
and
are
sustained
for
any
length
of
time
the
economic
and
political
fallout
could
be
considerable
there
are
already
some
preliminary
signs
that
the
global
economic
expansion
has
started
to
slow
under
pressure
from
higher
oil
prices
and
the
costs

created
by
the

the
