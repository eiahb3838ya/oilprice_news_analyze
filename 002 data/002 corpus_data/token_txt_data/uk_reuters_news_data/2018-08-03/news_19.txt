canadian
exports
hit
a
record
high
in
june
cutting
the
country
s
trade
deficit
to
its
lowest
in
months
although

slashed

statistics
canada
said
on
friday
the
june
deficit
of
c
million
million
the
lowest
since
the
c
shortfall
recorded
in
january
was
far
smaller
than
the
c
billion
predicted
by
analysts
in
a
reuters
poll
the
cheery
data
obscured
a
percent
drop
in
steel
exports
to
the
united
states
after
president
donald
trump
imposed
a
percent
tariff
at
the
end
of
may
canada
is
the
largest
single
supplier
of
steel
to
the
united
states
where
some
companies
are
complaining
about
increased
prices
the
unexpectedly
strong
overall
performance
boosted
market
expectations
that
the
bank
of
canada
could
hike
interest
rates
next
month
the
central
bank
has
raised
rates
four
times
since
the
middle
of
last
year
as
the
economy
has
strengthened
exports
jumped
by
percent
from
may
to
c
billion
on
higher
shipments
of
energy
products
and
aircraft
in
particular
business
jets
the
advance
was
the
greatest
since
a
percent
leap
seen
in
november
exports
rose
by
percent
from
the
first
the
greatest
such
gain
in
years
in
volume
terms
exports
grew
percent
the
data
will
have
markets
adding
a
bit
of
weight
to
the
odds
for
a
september
hike
or
at
a
minimum
gaining
even
more
confidence
about
one
in
october
said
avery
shenfeld
chief
economist
at
cibc
economics
the
bank
of
canada
which
announces
its
next
rate
decision
on
sept
has
expressed
concern
about
the
potential
damage
from
a
trade
war
with
the
united
states
the
value
of
steel
shipments
fell
to
c
million
in
june
from
may
while
exports
of
aluminum
to
the
united
states
subject
to
a
percent
tariff
dropped
percent
to
c
million
unlike
the
overall
data
the
figures
for
steel
and
aluminum
were
not
adjusted
for
seasonality
exports
of
both
metals
had
risen
significantly
in
the
months
leading
up
to
the
tariffs
as
industries
stockpiled
supplies
analysts
who
say
the
damage
will
be
much
greater
if
trump
goes
ahead
with
a
threat
to
impose
tariffs
on
autos
did
not
appear
too
worried
on
friday
the
fact
that
we
can
have
such
a
strong
print
with
the
metals
tariffs
dragging
on
things
illustrates
they
are
going
to
have
a
marginal
impact
on
the
canadian
economy
said
andrew
kelvin
senior
rates
strategist
at
td
securities
the
canadian
dollar
was
little
changed
at
c
or
cents
imports
fell
percent
on
lower
volumes
of
energy
products
a
number
of
canadian
refineries
that
had
been
shut
down
in
april
and
may
resumed
production
in
june
cutting
the
demand
for
foreign
gasoline
and
diesel
fuel
the
data
underscored
the
importance
to
canada
of
the
united
states
which
took
percent
of
all
canadian
goods
exports
in
june
exports
rose
percent
to
a
new
record
while
imports
edged
up
percent
as
a
result
the
trade
surplus
with
the
united
states
grew
to
c
billion
in
june
from
c
billion
in
may
