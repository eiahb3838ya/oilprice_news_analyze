china
s
targeting
of
liquefied
natural
gas
and
crude
oil
exports
opens
a
new
front
in
the
trade
war
between
the
two
countries
at
a
time
when
the
white
house
is
trumpeting
growing
energy
export
prowess
china
included
lng
for
the
first
time
in
its
list
of
proposed
tariffs
on
friday
the
same
day
that
its
biggest
crude
oil
buyer
sinopec
suspended
crude
oil
imports
due
to
the
dispute
according
to
three
sources
familiar
with
the
situation
on
friday
china
announced
retaliatory
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
goods
and
warned
of
further
measures
signaling
it
will
not
back
down
in
a
protracted
trade
war
with
washington
that
could
cast
a
shadow
over
president
donald
trump
s
energy
dominance
ambitions
the
administration
has
repeatedly
said
it
is
eager
to
expand
fossil
fuel
supplies
to
global
allies
while
washington
is
rolling
back
domestic
regulations
to
encourage
more
oil
and
gas
production
the
juxtaposition
here
is
clear
it
is
hard
to
become
an
energy
superpower
when
one
of
the
biggest
energy
consumers
in
the
world
is
raising
barriers
to
consume
that
energy
it
makes
it
very
difficult
said
michael
cohen
head
of
energy
markets
research
at
barclays
the
is
the
world
s
largest
exporter
of
fuels
like
gasoline
and
diesel
and
is
poised
to
become
one
of
the
largest
exporters
of
lng
by
china
is
the
world
s
biggest
crude
oil
importer
china
had
curtailed
its
imports
of
lng
over
the
last
two
months
even
before
its
formal
inclusion
in
the
list
of
potential
tariffs
it
had
also
become
the
largest
buyer
of
crude
oil
outside
of
canada
but
kpler
which
tracks
worldwide
oil
shipments
shows
crude
cargoes
to
china
have
also
dropped
off
in
recent
months
it
comes
at
a
time
when
the
united
states
has
several
lng
export
facilities
under
construction
and
after
trump
s
late
trip
to
china
that
included
executives
from
lng
companies
the
gas
industry
will
be
much
by
this
as
china
imports
only
a
small
volume
whereas
suppliers
see
china
as
a
major
future
market
said
lin
boqiang
professor
on
energy
studies
at
xiamen
university
in
china
china
became
the
world
s
second
biggest
lng
importer
in
as
it
buys
more
gas
in
order
to
wean
the
country
off
dirty
coal
to
reduce
pollution
china
which
purchased
almost
percent
of
all
lng
shipped
between
february
and
may
has
taken
delivery
from
just
one
vessel
that
left
the
united
states
in
june
and
none
so
far
in
july
compared
with
during
the
first
five
months
of
the
year
for
an
interactive
graphic
on
lng
shipments
to
china
see
meanwhile
according
to
kpler
crude
exports
to
china
dropped
to
an
estimated
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
july
after
reaching
a
record
bpd
in
march
sinopec
through
its
unipec
trading
arm
is
the
largest
buyer
of
crude
with
lng
demand
expected
to
skyrocket
over
the
next
to
months
there
are
still
some
two
dozen
firms
seeking
to
build
new
lng
export
terminals
in
the
united
states
and
tariffs
may
limit
their
ability
to
secure
sufficient
buyers
to
finance
their
proposed
projects
lng
producers
will
try
to
move
to
other
locations
said
dominick
chirichella
director
of
risk
management
trading
and
advisory
services
at
emi
dtn
in
new
york
noting
there
will
likely
be
a
big
push
to
places
like
europe
and
japan
it
s
tough
to
say
whether
that
would
offset
the
loss
of
lng
from
china
so
until
producers
get
reorganized
it
could
slow
down
some
of
the
exports
