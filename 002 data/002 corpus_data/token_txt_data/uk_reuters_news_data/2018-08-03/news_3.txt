crude
futures
pulled
back
on
friday
giving
up
gains
from
the
previous
session
as
trade
concerns
weighed
on
the
market
and
fuelled
concerns
about
demand

brent
crude
futures
settled
at
per
barrel
down
cents
from
their
last
close
both
grades
briefly
traded
down
more
than
a
barrel
crude
ended
the
week
down
percent
while
brent
has
fallen
percent
in
the
week
so
far
it
s
a
jittery
feel
here
as
long
as
we
have
iranian
sanctions
uncertainty
and
tariff
uncertainty
and
it
doesn
t
take
much
to
spark
a
significant
swing
one
way
or
the
other
said
jim
ritterbusch
an
analyst
in
galena
illinois
fears
that
chinese
demand
could
taper
fuelled
the
pullback
on
friday
after
state
oil
major
sinopec
cut
its
purchases
of
crude
china
s
unipec
the
trading
arm
of
sinopec
has
suspended
crude
oil
imports
from
the
united
states
due
to
the
growing
trade
spat
between
washington
and
beijing
three
sources
familiar
with
the
situation
said
on
friday
chinese
demand
from
the
independent
refiners
is
also
lower
while
the
escalating
trade
war
also
doesn
t
help
sentiment
said
warren
patterson
commodities
strategist
at
ing
china
has
said
it
plans
to
impose
tariffs
on
liquefied
natural
gas
raising
concerns
that
it
could
also
impose
tariffs
on
oil

nonfarm
payrolls
rose
in
july
but
the
trade
deficit
recorded
its
biggest
increase
in
more
than
years
in
june
as
the
boost
to
exports
from
soybean
shipments
faded
and
higher
oil
prices
lifted
the
import
bill
the
commerce
department
said
on
friday
the
trade
gap
surged
percent
to
billion
russian
oil
output
rose
by
barrels
per

bpd
in

from
a
month
earlier
to
million

energy
ministry
data
showed
on
thursday
output
by
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
has
also
risen
recently
to
around
million
bpd
and
production
is
around
that
level
as
well
saudi
arabia
russia
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
have
increased
production
to
help
to
compensate
for
an
anticipated
shortfall
in
iranian
crude
supplies
once
planned
sanctions
take
effect
later
this
year
but
a
complete
halt
to
iranian
supplies
looks
unlikely
with
bloomberg
reporting
on
friday
that
china
iran
s
biggest
customer
has
rejected
a
request
to
cut
imports
from
the
opec
member
low
stockpiles
were
still
providing
a
floor
for
prices
with
overall
crude
inventories
below
the
average
of
around
million
barrels
but
there
were
concerns
about
potential
stockpile
builds
as
supply
returns
from
a
canadian
production
facility
that
has
been
shuttered
drillers
cut
rigs
for
the
second
week
in
three
reducing
the
number
of
oil
rigs
by
two
to
the
rig
count
can
be
a
indicator
of
production
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
cut
their
bullish
crude
bets
in
the
latest
week
as
oil
prices
were
pinned
between
concerns
about
tight
supply
due
to
sanctions
and
fears
that
trade
disputes
could
curb
demand
the
speculator
group
cut
its
combined

position
