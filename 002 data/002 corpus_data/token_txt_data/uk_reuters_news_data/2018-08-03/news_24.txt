i
count
on
you
for
a
lifetime
stirring
words
from
the
anthem
of
pederneiras
city
that
show
the
status
of
a
waterway
that
helps
power
brazil
s
entire
economy
be
it
generating
electricity
or
transporting
crops
the
river
is
key
but
acute
water
shortages
have
sparked
a
dispute
over
who
has
more
right
to
exploit
it
and
experts
say
the
government
must
tackle
the
issue
as
shortages
grow
ever
worse
water
scarcity
is
a
new
regular
scenario
not
an
emergency

an
energy
expert
at
research
institute
instituto
de

e

ambiente
iema
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
one
of
brazil
s
key
transport
corridors
for
soybeans
corn
fertiliser
and
other
farm
products
it
was
closed
for
months
between
due
to
drought
and
the
diversion
of
water
for
electricity
with
an
estimated
loss
of
million
to
shipping
companies
and
jobs
as
the
waterway
in
the
state
of
sao
paulo
engine
of
the
nation
s
economy
threatens
to
close
again
due
to
erratic
rainfall
experts
have
urged
policymakers
to
define
more
clearly
who
can
exploit
the
river
and
when
agriculture
and
agribusiness
accounted
for
about
a
quarter
of
brazil
s
gross
domestic
product
in
according
to
farm
lobby
cna
the
country
is
the
third
biggest
electricity
producer
in
the
americas
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
yet
despite
the
existence
of
a
national
policy
regulating
the
use
of
water
resources
there
is
a
grey
zone
that
triggers
conflict
between
transport
and
energy
companies
said
soares
the
law
does
not
clearly
define
who
should
enjoy
priority
access
to
the
river
which
is
rich
in
rapids
and
punctuated
by
steep
falls
in
times
of
water
scarcity
he
added
in
cases
of
erratic
rainfall
national
grid
operator
ons
requests
more
water
from
the
river
to
power
hydroelectric
dams
located
nearby
which
can
prevent
barge
trains
from
passing
down
the
waterway
soares
explained
if
the
river
is
to
be
used
primarily
for
electricity
in
times
of
water
scarcity
that
needs
to
be
made
clear
by
regulators
and
shipping
companies
must
have
other
alternatives
if
they
are
grounded
soares
said
if
transportation
companies
can
not
honour
their
contracts
they
will
have
adalberto
tokarski
head
of
brazilian
government
agency
antaq
said
transportation
companies
had
filed
lawsuits
over
the
costly
waterway
closure
the
law
is
very
clear
but
it
is
not
respected
due
to
the
power
of
interference
of
the
electric
sector
the
law
does
not
give
supremacy
to
the
electric
sector
it
guarantees
the
multiple
uses
of
water
and
there
has
to
be
a
balance
tokarski
said
competition
over
use
of
the
waterway
goes
back
over
a
decade
when
the
country
faced
an
electrical
crisis
due
to
low
rainfall
and
the
waterway
was
almost
closed
in
water
that
could
have
helped
maintain
s
levels
was
used
instead
for
electricity
due
to
rising
energy
demand
and
the
delay
of
giant
new
power
projects
in
brazil
was
also
hosting
the
world
cup
sao
paulo
south
america
s
largest
city
came
critically
close
to
running
out
of
drinking
water
lower
river
levels
force
barge
trains
to
reduce
the
amount
of
exports
they
carry
on
the
waterway
or
even
prevent
them
from
using
the
corridor
completely
said
raimundo
holanda
head
of
the
national

navigation
companies

in
the

transported
a
record
high
of
million
tons
of
cargo
compared
to
million
in
the
waterway
department
of
sao
paulo
state
said
by
email
but
that
may
change
if
the
river
s
water
is
again
used
to
power
hydroelectric
dams
in
a
country
that
sources
about
of
its
energy
from
hydropower
said
tokarski
the
decision
to
close
the
waterway
lies

a

mayor
of

known
as

capital
the
waterway
is
very
important
to
generate
jobs
and
attract
private
investments

a
former

is
one
of
hundreds
of
workers
who
lost
their
jobs
when
the
waterway
closed
in
it
was
tough
a
good
part
of
my
professional
life
i
spent
on
this
waterway
lima
said
by
a
railway
over
the
tiete
river
every
year
there
is
a
threat
to
close
the
waterway
i
did
not
want
to
come
back
because
of
all
this
conflicts
over
ownership
of
rivers
also
rage
in
the
amazon
where
big
dams
were
built
in
recent
years

transportation

about
sharp

something
he
says
did
not
happen
before
the
dam
was
built
in
an
emailed
statement
energy
company
santo
antonio
energia
said
the
dam
does
not
affect
levels
because
the
river
flow
it
receives
is
immediately
discharged
the
changes
that
occur
in
the
flow
of
the
madeira
river
are
due
to
the
melting
of
the
andes
and
periods
of
intense
rains
