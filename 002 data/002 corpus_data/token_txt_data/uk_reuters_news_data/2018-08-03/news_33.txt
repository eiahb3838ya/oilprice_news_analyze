minister
giovanni

is
under
pressure
from
within
the

to
raise
spending
and
challenge
european

budget
rules
the
possibility
that
he
might
be
forced
to

has
investors
worried
that
italy
could
go
on
a
spending
binge
or
even
that
fresh

could
follow

the

bonds
have
been
most
sensitive
to
concern
over
the
chance
of
an
italian
exit
from
the
euro
which
would
increase
default
risk
on

coming

clearly
this
is
about
the
fear
that
tria
gets
kicked
out

could
lead

new
elections
