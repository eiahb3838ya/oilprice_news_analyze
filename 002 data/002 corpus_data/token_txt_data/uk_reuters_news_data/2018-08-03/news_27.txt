when
krishna
maya
sunar
received
rupees
from
a
forest
protection
project
in
gorkha
in
nepal
it
changed
her
life
that
was
seven
years
ago
until
then
she
got
by
selling
liquor
it
did
not
earn
much
about
rupees
a
month
and
being
illegal
was
risky
but
having
that
larger
sum
which
was
given
to
each
member
of
a
community
forestry
group
in
gorkha
which
lies
about
kilometres
miles
northwest
of
the
capital
kathmandu
meant
sunar
could
turn
her
hand
to
if
it
weren
t
for
the
money
i
wouldn
t
know
how
i
would
be
able
to
survive
she
said
sunar
s
situation
is
unusual
and
not
only
because
she
was
one
of
the
earliest
nepali
recipients
of
money
from
a
project
a
forestry
conservation
scheme
aimed
at
combatting
climate
change
it
is
also
because
sunar
is
a
dalit
in
this
predominantly
hindu
society
dalit
people
or
untouchables
are
near
the
bottom
of
the
rung
they
have
restricted
access
to
natural
resources
and
are
often
mired
in
poverty
and
few
have
benefited
as
much
as
other
nepalis
from
reducing
emissions
from
deforestation
and
forest
degradation
payments
said
nira
jairu
a
dalit
and
member
of
parliament
the
funds
must
reach
the
dalit
she
said
the
government
has
pledged
to
come
up
with
an
inclusive
plan
to
ensure
that
such
payments
benefit
all
including
the
most
marginalized
sindhu
dhungana
heads
the
redd
implementation
center
a
government
body
tasked
with
overseeing
the
development
of
nepal
s
redd
strategy
and
the
plan
he
said
the
government
would
include
the
input
of
people
at
the
local
level
when
preparing
and
implementing
the
plan
principally
the
will
be
fair
and
equitable
in
principle
and
at
an
operational
level
he
said
the
government
will
this
year
consult
with
marginalized
sectors
of
society
including
dalit
communities
on
the
plan
before
the
proposal
heads
to
parliament
for
approval
he
said
by
next
year
he
added
the
country
would
be
able
to
sign
a
deal
with
the
forest
carbon
partnership
facility
fcpf
a
world
bank
programme
of
governments
civil
society
groups
and
businesses
engaged
in
that
sets
the
price
for
the
carbon
credits
simply
put
nepal
must
first
show
that
it
can
distribute
the
money
it
will
receive
to
those
involved
in
sustainably
managing
its
forests
before
the
fcpf
will
make
payments
dhungana
said
the
carbon
money
should
be
trickled
down
to
local
people
who
have
contributed
to
reducing
emissions
he
said
schemes
look
to
cut
emissions
linked
to
deforestation
while
giving
local
communities
a
financial
benefit
for
conserving
and
managing
forests
sunar
s
project
was
part
of
a
pilot
programme
funded
by
the
norwegian
agency
for
development
cooperation
norad
between
and
forests
act
as
carbon
sinks
storing
carbon
dioxide
a
greenhouse
gas
that
contributes
to
climate
change
cutting
trees
means
carbon
dioxide
is
released
many
experts
say
protecting
forests
is
one
of
the
least
costly
ways
to
reduce
climate
change
as
part
of
these
programmes
industrialized
countries
and
donors
such
as
norad
in
sunar
s
case
pay
developing
countries
to
manage
their
forests
sustainably
forest
countries
then
can
sell
credits
for
emissions
reductions
for
instance
to
companies
looking
to
offset
the
carbon
they
emit
developing
countries
also
need
to
implement
safeguards
to
minimize
the
damage
the
programme
could
have
on
the
livelihoods
and
cultures
of
communities
that
rely
on
forests
particularly
indigenous
people
the
pilot
project
in
sunar
s
district
along
with
two
others
funded
by
norad
had
provided
useful
lessons
that
the
government
would
take
on
board
dhungana
said
including
understanding
what
the
programme
entails
it
had
also
shown
that
should
include
social
aspects
he
said
and
not
simply
look
at
the
carbon
impact
sunar
s
community
learned
how
to
measure
carbon
to
calculate
a
baseline
and
then
by
planting
trees
preventing
fires
and
cutting
less
timber
boost
the
amount
of
stored
carbon
in
the
forested
ludikhola
watershed
where
they
live
the
asia
network
for
sustainable
agriculture
and
bioresources
ansab
kathmandu
one
of
the
organizations
which
managed
the
project
said
community
groups
in
gorkha
had
received
about
from
norad
in
those
groups
were
able
to
show
they
had
increased
the
amount
of
stored
carbon
by
nearly
tons
and
that
they
had
met
the
criteria
that
members
must
include
dalits
indigenous
people
and
women
and
although
they
have
not
received
money
since
the
community
still
looks
after
the
forest

is
also
a

one
of
the
forest
guards
known
as
lauro
pulo
under
the
lauro

system
two
persons
serve
as
forest
guards
for
a
day
looking
out
for
fires
illegal
logging
and
the
theft
of
other
forest
resources
as
members
of
the
community
forestry
user
group
they
also
devised
ways
of
monitoring
the
funds
including
monthly
public
hearings
to
discuss
how
to
use
the
money
said
bhuraman
ghimire
who
chairs
one
of
the
community
forestry
groups
in
gorkha
before
these
activities
were
not
conducted
he
said
jiba

paudel
gorkha
s
district
forest
officer
said
the
pilot
had
worked
well
because
the
community
had
taken
part
in
making
decisions
the
community
forestry
groups
decide
properly
based
on
their
social
norms
