flocked
to
the
hotel
in
odessa
texas
on
a
thursday
last
month
to
be
courted
by
halliburton
which
needs
people
to
handle
everything
from
oilfield
technicians
to
truck
drivers
as
oil
production
booms
and
qualified
workers
become
more
scarce
the
unemployment
rate
is
percent
just
off
an
low
but
job
growth
has
slowed
more
recently
notably
because
companies
are
having
trouble
finding
people
that
is
particularly
true
in
the
oilfields
of
west
texas
where
workers
from
local
towns
like
midland
and
odessa
have
flocked
to
the
oil
industry
for
higher
pay
according
to
a
june
dallas
federal
reserve
bank
survey
of
oil
executives
operating
in
west
texas
more
than
half
cited
difficulty
finding
workers
as
a
potential
drag
on
growth
