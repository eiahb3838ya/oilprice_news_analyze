the

is
known
posted
a
net
profit
of
billion

in
the
second
quarter
soaring
from
a
profit
of
million

in
the

period
a
year
earlier

it
was
hit
by
a
charge
the
company
had
been
expected
to
earn
billion
in
the
second
quarter
of
according
to
analysts
estimates
petrobras
shares
gained
more
than
percent
advancing
to
their
highest
level
since
may
when
its
former
chief
executive
officer
pedro
parente
voluntarily
cut
diesel
prices
in
a
bid
to
defuse
a
nationwide
truckers
protest
over
rising
fuel
costs
that
paralyzed
latin
america
s
top
economy
the
truckers
stayed
off
the
job
until
president
michel
temer
s
government
agreed
to
sweeping
moves
to
cut
diesel
prices
through
tax
reductions
and
subsidies
for
petrobras
and
other
fuel
vendors
that
sparked
fears
of
renewed
political
meddling
at
the
company
and
helped
drive
parente
to
resign
the
diesel
subsidy
plan
so
far
has
hurt
petrobras
competitors
that
rely
on
fuel
imports
more
than
the

at
petrobras
refineries
also
rose
to

in
june
from

in
march
companies
joined
the
subsidy
program
and
what
happened
was
a
big
reduction
in
the
volume
of
diesel
imports
and
a
small
increase
in
petrobras
market
share
but
i
think
that
is
going
back
to
normal
