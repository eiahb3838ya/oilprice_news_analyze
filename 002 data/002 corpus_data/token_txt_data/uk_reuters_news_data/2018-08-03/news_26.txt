minister
giovanni

is
under
pressure
from
within

to
raise

and
challenge
european

budget
rules
the
possibility
that
he
might
be
forced
to
resign
has
investors
worried
that
italy
could
go
on
a
spending
binge
or
even
that
fresh
elections
could
follow
that
in
turn
could
strengthen
the
hand
of
the
eurosceptic
league
party
and
its
leader
matteo
salvini
clearly
this
is
about
the
fear
that
tria
gets
kicked
out
which
could
lead
to
a
collapse
of

new
elections
