reuters
in
a
round
of
interviews
and
media
briefings
on
wednesday
trump
administration
officials
downplayed
the
risk
of
a
trade
war
with
china
insisting
tariff
threats
are
just
the
first
round
in
negotiations
the
concerted
attempt
to
calm
market
nerves
came
after
the
two
countries
each
published
a
list
of
potential
targets
for
higher
tariffs
in
a
dispute
over
intellectual
property
and
technology
transfer
there
s
no
trade
war
here
the
president
s
top
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
said
in
an
interview
with
fox
business
network
kudlow
there
is
absolutely
not
a
trade
war
real
clear
politics
april
what
you
ve
got
is
the
early
stages
of
a
process
which
will
include
tariffs
comments
on
the
tariffs
then
ultimate
decisions
and
negotiations
there
are
already
talks
going
on
kudlow
said
these
are
just
the
first
proposals
we
re
putting
it
out
for
comment
it
s
going
to
take
a
couple
of
months
i
doubt
there
will
be
any
concrete
action
for
several
the
same
talking
points
were
echoed
by
other
senior
officials
including
trump
s
press
secretary
his
commerce
secretary
and
his
hawkish
foreign
trade
adviser
the
soothing
message
appeared
to
work
with
equity
indices
reversing
earlier
losses
as
investors
concluded
the
risk
of
threatened
tariffs
actually
being
imposed
was
low
but
investors
and
traders
are
probably
underestimating
the
difficulty
of
the
negotiations
and
the
risk
the
united
states
and
china
could
drift
into
a
damaging
confrontation
by
accident
the
threat
to
impose
additional
percent
tariffs
on
imports
from
china
worth
up
to
billion
fits
with
the
trump
administration
s
typical
negotiating
pattern
in
general
the
administration
starts
by
making
an
aggressive
and
openly
controversial
announcement
to
drive
an
issue
up
the
agenda
control
the
framing
and
create
leverage
before
settling
down
to
negotiate
the
details
in
private
it
has
already
employed
this
approach
by
threatening
to
leave
free
trade
agreements
with
canada
mexico
and
south
korea
as
well
as
with
steel
and
aluminium
tariffs
outside
the
trade
area
it
has
used
the
same
strategy
to
demand
changes
to
the
nuclear
agreement
with
iran
denuclearisation
of
north
korea
more
by
nato
allies
a
border
wall
with
mexico
and
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
undocumented
child
migrants
so
far
the
results
have
been
mixed
the
south
korea
free
trade
agreement
has
reportedly
been
renegotiated
with
some
minor
changes
and
there
has
been
some
progress
with
nato
but
none
of
the
other
negotiations
has
yet
reached
a
successful
conclusion
in
employing
the
same
tactics
with
china
the
administration
has
picked
a
much
more
formidable
negotiating
adversary
and
opened
up
a
more
complicated
set
of
issues
there
is
no
guarantee
the
negotiations
will
reach
a
successful
conclusion
and
avoid
imposition
of
the
threatened
tariffs
so
while
negotiations
may
be
able
to
avert
tariffs
there
is
a
probability
that
they
will
fail
to
achieve
a
solution
the
process
itself
is
likely
to
be
a
source
of
considerable
uncertainty
for
businesses
in
both
countries
as
well
as
third
parties
in
their
supply
chains
for
months
most
market
participants
are
probably
underestimating
how
difficult
the
negotiations
will
prove
and
the
risk
of
failure
or
at
least
repeated
bouts
of
tension
the
administration
s
mixed
messages
are
themselves
a
source
of
confusion
senior
officials
are
trying
to
convince
investors
tariffs
are
unlikely
to
be
imposed
so
as
not
to
trigger
a
fall
in
equity
prices
or
business
confidence
but
for
its
hardline
negotiating
strategy
to
work
the
administration
must
convince
china
and
other
countries
the
threat
to
impose
tariffs
is
very
real
the
united
states
has
presented
a
long
list
of
grievances
as
part
of
its
section
investigation
into
technology
transfer
notice
of
determination
united
states
trade
representative
april
but
it
is
part
of
a
wider
set
of
disputes
between
the
united
states
and
china
that
cover
intellectual
property
subsidisation
dumping
government
ownership
of
enterprises
and
restrictions
on
market
access
as
well
as
the
overall
trade
imbalance
policymakers
have
questioned
almost
every
aspect
of
china
s
economic
model
which
is
in
turn
deeply
embedded
in
the
country
s
social
and
political
system
achieving
wholesale
change
will
not
be
possible
no
country
would
allow
another
to
impose
changes
to
its
fundamental
model
short
of
defeat
in
war
so
the
united
states
will
have
to
narrow
its
demands
to
a
list
of
specific
and
realistic
steps
that
china
will
be
able
to
take
washington
will
also
need
to
provide
reassurance
that
once
a
deal
is
done
it
will
not
be
in
future
with
demands
for
even
more
concessions
critically
any
deal
must
allow
both
sides
to
save
face
and
avoid
the
appearance
china
is
making
unilateral
concessions
under
pressure
even
before
the
tariffs
were
announced
china
and
the
united
states
had
been
trying
to
negotiate
a
deal
over
technology
transfer
intellectual
property
and
other
issues
by
increasing
the
political
temperature
the
reciprocal
tariff
announcements
have
probably
made
it
harder
rather
than
easier
to
achieve
an
outcome
acceptable
to
both
sides
china
has
already
reiterated
it
will
not
negotiate
and
make
concessions
under
external
pressure
china
says
it
never
backs
down
in
the
face
of
threats
after
trade
salvos
with
reuters
april
president
donald
trump
and
china
s
president
xi
jinping
have
each
cultivated
an
image
as
a
strong
leader
so
neither
can
afford
to
back
down
and
be
seen
as
weak
in
front
of
a
domestic
audience
the
two
sides
are
engaged
in

the
negotiating
process
could
easily
drag
on
for
six
months
or
more
creating
significant
uncertainty
for
business
in
the
meantime
and
complicating
investment
decisions
businesses
will
have
to
start
to
plan
for
the
imposition
of
tariffs
on
their
supply
chain
even
if
they
are
never
imposed
even
the
threat
of
tariffs
has
real
consequences
for
investment
and
trade
flows
while
the
most
likely
outcome
is
probably
a
deal
there
is
a
and
probably
significant
risk
of
breakdown
for
the
moment
markets
are
assuming
the
negotiations
will
succeed
but
investors
should
probably
start
to
take
more
seriously
the
possibility
of
failure
and
price
