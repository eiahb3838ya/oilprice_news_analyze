russia
s
top
state
lender
sberbank
opposes
a
plan
by
billionaire
mikhail
gutseriyev
to
merge
his
oil
assets
into
one
firm
and
replace
glencore
because
of
concerns
about
his
energy
companies
heavy
debts
sources
told
reuters
gutseriyev
who
has
built
his
oil
wealth
with
the
help
of
glencore
over
the
past
years
had
to
endure
a
painful
debt
restructuring
that
left
his
energy
empire
split
into
two
parts
the
magnate
now
wants
to
merge
the
firms
russneft
and
neftisa
both
of
which
are
heavily
indebted
to
vtb
russia
s
bank
and
sberbank
it
was
not
yet
clear
why
such
an
integration
would
be
needed
although
one
source
said
a
larger
merged
company
would
be
able
to
borrow
more
as
part
of
the
plan
gutseriyev
wants
glencore
s
percent
stake
in
russneft
to
be
bought
out
by
a
new
investor
possibly
from
china
but
the
proposal
has
drawn
criticism
from
sberbank
and
not
yet
been
discussed
with
glencore
the
sources
said
the
gutseriyev
family
owns
percent
of
russneft
gutseriyev
is
looking
for
another
partner
to
replace
it
glencore
telling
creditors
that
the
chinese
will
be
there
soon
one
of
the
sources
familiar
with
the
idea
said
the
potential
merger
would
be
further
complicated
as
stakes
in
russneft
and
neftisa
are
held
as
collateral
by
vtb
and
sberbank
under
loans
these
two
companies
have
different
creditors
so
the
merger
is
technically
impossible
the
source
said
the
sources
said
there
was
no
firm
deal
on
the
table
russneft
produces
around
million
tonnes
of
oil
per
year
while
neftisa
pumps
million
tonnes
sberbank
and
vtb
have
also
lent
to
other
parts
of
gutseriyev
s
empire
in
particular
real
estate
developer
inteko
and
russia
s
largest
home
electronics
retailer
respectively
a
third
source
who
is
familiar
with
glencore
s
position
said
the
merger
idea
had
not
been
discussed
with
the
trading
company
and
was
not
yet
concrete
or
serious
enough
glencore
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
reuters

for
comment
sberbank
and
vtb
declined
to
comment
b
n
bank
formerly
part
of
the
safmar
holding
company
that
groups
gutseriyev
s
family
assets
was
taken
over
last
year
in
a
bailout
by
the
russian
central
bank
which
said
safmar
s
banking
business
had
expanded
too
aggressively
the
central
bank
has
held
a
minority
stake
in
russneft
since
the
bailout
it
is
not
clear
whether
and
how
that
could
affect
the
potential
merger
the
