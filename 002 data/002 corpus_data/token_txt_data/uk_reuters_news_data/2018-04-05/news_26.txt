global
shipping
should
set
a
goal
of
halving
greenhouse

emissions
by
norway
s
government

before
talks
by
the
international

vessels
dry
bulk
crude
crude

the
imo
which
says
international
shipping
represents
about
percent
of
world
carbon
dioxide
emissions
will
meet
from
april
to
develop
a
strategy
to
combat
climate
change
shipping
was
not
included
in
the
paris
climate
agreement
emissions
should
be
reduced
by
percent
towards
compared
to
harald
solberg
head
of
the
norwegian
shipowners
association
told
a
joint
news
conference
with
trade
minister
torbjoern
rooe
isaksen
in
the
same
period
demand
will
increase

maybe
percent
so
in
absolute
terms
it
s
more
than
a
half
solberg
said
we
need
international
rules
our
base
line
is
the
same
as
the
norwegian
shipowners
to
cut
emissions
by
percent
towards
isaksen
told
reuters
we
hope
the
imo
will
agree
on
these
ambitious
emission
targets
that
is
the
only
solution
if
not
we
fear
regional
solutions
and
that
will
not
work
solberg
said
he
said
that
the
association
s
vision
is
that
shipping
should
be
emissions
free
in
the
imo
says
its
marine
environment
protection
committee
is
expected
to
adopt
an
initial
strategy
on
the
reduction
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
from
ships
at
the
meeting
in
london
the
paris
agreement
sets
a
goal
of
phasing
out
net
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
the
second
half
of
the
century
mainly
by
shifting
from
fossil
