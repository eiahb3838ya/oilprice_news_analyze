premiums
for
heavy
naphtha
have
risen
to
highs
as
south
korean
petrochemical
companies
have
turned
to
the
product
to
replace
a
shortfall
in
the
condensates
that
they
typically
use
to
run
in
their
units
said
five
industry
sources
hanwha
total
petrochemical
has
bought
at
least
tonnes
of
heavy
naphtha
a
month
so
far
this
year
versus
an
average
of
tonnes
a
month
in
said
the
sources
who
participate
in
the
asian
naphtha
market
meanwhile
sk
incheon
petrochem
a
unit
of
sk
innovation
purchased
tonnes
of
the
product
for
april
delivery
versus
up
to
tonnes
a
month
previously
the
sources
said
heavy
naphtha
has
a
higher
content
of
compounds
known
as
aromatics
that
are
used
as
precursors
for
petrochemicals
such
as
xylenes
and
paraxylenes
the
companies
will
likely
keep
purchasing
more
heavy
naphtha
until
june
as
a
supply
crunch
in
condensate
a
type
of
light
crude
oil
has
made
it
uneconomical
for
the
buyers
to
switch
back
the
sources
said
sk
incheon
petrochem
s
heavy
naphtha
imports
have
increased
because
it
is
now
more
economical
than
using
condensate
said
a
spokesman
from
sk
innovation
but
he
did
not
elaborate
on
the
volumes
bought
a
spokesman
for
hanwha
total
declined
to
comment
there
has
been
less
condensate
available
for
asian
buyers
as
new
splitters
or
processing
units
that
break
down
the
condensate
into
different
types
of
naphtha
and
some
middle
distillates
in
south
korea
singapore
and
the
middle
east
have
started
up
however
the
supply
dent
intensified
when
iran
cut
its
monthly
shipments
of
south
pars
condensate
to
south
korea
by
million
barrels
three
sources
that
participate
in
the
market
told
reuters
last
month
premiums
for
condensate
cargoes
for
april
and
may
loading
rose
to
as
high
as

while
hanwha
paid
up
to
which
is
the
highest
premium
the
company
has
paid
for
any
naphtha
grades
since
april
due
to
the
shortage
of
condensate
in
asia
competing
south
korean
refiners
and
hyundai
oilbank
which
also
operate
condensate
splitters
in
south
korea
have
recently
bought
condensate
from
norway
however
not
all
condensate
splitters

process
