french
consumer
group
ufc
que
choisir
called
for
an
investigation
and
tighter
regulation
of
utility
edf
saying
its
virtual
monopoly
on
power
generation
in
france
led
to
higher
prices
ufc
said
a
study
of
nuclear
plant
utilisation
and
wholesale
power
prices
showed
that
when
prices
are
low
edf
systematically
underutilises
its
nuclear
reactors
leading
to
greater
use
of
more
expensive
fossil
power
stations
which
in
turn
leads
to
higher
retail
power
prices
the
consumer
group
estimated
that
these
practices
had
boosted
edf
s
income
by
about
billion
euros
billion
between
and
and
had
added
about
billion
euros
to
consumers
bills
between
and
for
individual
power
consumers
whose
average
bill
is
around
euros
per
year
the
extra
cost
was
about
euros
over
the
period
for
edf
clients
and
euros
for
the
clients
of
edf
competitors
such
as
engie
and
direct
energie
which
partly
rely
on
electricity
the
management
of
edf
s
nuclear
fleet
is
completely
unfavourable
to
the
consumer
and
to
the
exclusive
benefit
of
edf
because
edf
has
a
monopoly
and
does
what
it
wants
ufc
president
alain
bazot
told
reporters
on
thursday
he
said
it
is
up
to
energy
market
regulator
cre
or
the
french
competition
authority
to
investigate
edf
s
practices
he
also
called
for
tighter
regulation
of
the
way
edf
operates
its
nuclear
plants
notably
an
obligation
for
edf
to
justify
nuclear
output
cuts
when
there
is
no
technical
problem
edf
denied
wrongdoing
edf
strongly
denies
ufc
s
accusations
edf
at
all
times
optimises
its
power
generation
fleet
and
operates
under
the
close
supervision
of
market
regulator
cre
the
utility
said
in
a
statement
a
cre
spokeswoman
said
the
regulator
monitors
wholesale
markets
to
prevent
insider
trading
and
market
manipulation
she
said
that
currently
six
investigations
are
under
way
but
declined
to
comment
on
the
ufc
study
ufc
energy
specialist
nicolas
mouchnino
said
that
market
data
show
that
a
fall
in
nuclear
power
output
in
germany
and
britain
typically
leads
to
an
increase
in
wholesale
market
prices
but
that
in
france
nuclear
power
output
typically
falls
as
wholesale
prices
drop
edf
adjusts
the
capacity
utilisation
of
its
nuclear
fleet
in
order
to
boost
its
profitability
to
the
detriment
of
consumers
he
said
the
ufc
report
also
said
that
since
power
exchanges
with
germany
have
been
dysfunctional
it
said
this
was
because
when
wholesale
prices
are
lower
in
germany
relatively
little
power
is
imported
into
france
while
when
power
prices
are
slightly
cheaper
in
france
exports
towards
germany
are
massive
there
is
a
need
for
an
investigation
into
this
activity
mouchnino
said
france
s
interconnectors
are
operated
