a
major
european
carmaker
could
be
brought
to
its
knees
by
carbon
dioxide
emissions
fines
allowing
a
chinese
buyer
to
step
in
with
its
own
electric
vehicle
technology
peugeot
maker
psa
group
s
chief
executive
said
carlos
tavares
who
chairs
european
auto
industry
lobby
group
acea
said
that
policymakers
had
failed
to
anticipate
this
outcome
of
the
european
union
s
goals
the
impact
is
very
obvious
it
s
going
to
create
a
chinese
trojan
horse
in
europe
tavares
told
an
industry
event
hosted
by
french
car
magazine
le
journal
de
l
auto
late
on
wednesday
his
outspoken
comments
come
against
a
backdrop
of
rising
trade
tensions
between
china
and
the
united
states
and
wider
concerns
about
growing
protectionism
worldwide
they
also
underscore
concerns
about
foreign
influence
over
european
manufacturers
jobs
and
technology
which
have
risen
since
china
s
geely
snapped
up
percent
of
germany
s
daimler
in
february
if
a
european
carmaker
missed
its
targets
and
was
brought
to
its
knees
by
fines
it
could
not
be
acquired
by
another
big
european
carmaker
purely
because
of
antitrust
rules
tavares
said
without
naming
any
manufacturer
that
would
create
the
opportunity
for
a
foreign
investor
to
bring
in
the
kind
of
technology
imposed
by
european
authorities
which
means
electric
vehicles
he
said
and
who
s
the
leader
in
electrification
it
s
the
chinese
he
added
psa
itself
by
china
s
dongfeng
motor
has
accelerated
new
vehicle
development
at
opel
and
vauxhall
after
uncovering
what
tavares
described
as
hidden
emissions
problems
following
the
brands
acquisition
from
general
motors
last
year
thanks
to
the
extra
investment
the
group
maintains
it
is
now
on
track
to
meet
goals
averaging
grammes
per
kilometer
being
phased
in
from
backed
by
hundreds
of
millions
of
euros
in
potential
fines
for
the
current
average
for
new
cars
is
tavares
has
called
for
the
eu
penalties
to
be
suspended
until
governments
roll
out
adequate
charging
networks
saying
last
month
he
planned
to
raise
the
proposal
at
a
meeting
of
acea
on
march
acea
has
not
approached
the
european
commission
to
reopen
any
discussion
of
the
goals
a
spokeswoman
told
reuters
president
donald
trump
s
administration
moved
this
week
to
weaken
goals
previously
agreed
for
in
response
to
calls
for
a
revision
by
carmakers
psa
and
other
european
carmakers
are
facing
declining
sales
of
diesel
models
making
it
harder
to
meet
targets
and
avoid
large
fines
