yemen
the
arabian
peninsula
s
poorest
country
is
reeling
from
the
world
s
worst
humanitarian
crisis
where
million
people
need
vital
assistance
when
the
houthis
fired
missiles
at
riyadh
last
november
the
coalition
shut
yemen
s
airports
and
ports
the
united
nations
said
that
blockade
raised
the
danger
of
mass
starvation
and
it
was
partially
lifted
but
diplomats
say
saudi
arabia
has
been
under
heavy
pressure
from
its
main
ally
the
united
states
to
speed
up
aid
the
blockade
and
delays
have
had
a
chilling
effect
on
commercial
suppliers
as
ships
pay
hefty
demurrage
fees
as
they
wait
for
unloading
experts
say
the
blockade
of
november
and
december
has
been
solved
in
january
but
really
the
ships
from
djibouti
to
the
harbour
of
hodeidah
started
regularly
only
at
the
end
of
february
said
nevio
zagaria
the
world
health
organization
s
envoy
in
yemen
but
bureaucratic
impediments
still
slow
the
aid
flow
both
at
hodeidah
and
aden
ports
he
told
reuters
we
are
now
early
april
we
still
have
the
backlog
of
thousands
of
pallets
that
have
been
waiting
to
be
transported
