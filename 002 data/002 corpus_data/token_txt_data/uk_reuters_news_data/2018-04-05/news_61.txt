asian
shares
bounced
from
lows
on
thursday
as
world
equities
recovered
from
a
selloff
triggered
by
escalating
trade
tensions
with
investors
hoping
a
trade
war
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
can
be
averted
sentiment
was
lifted
as
the
united
states
expressed
willingness
to
negotiate
a
resolution
to
the
trade
fight
after
the
proposed
tariffs
on
billion
in
chinese
goods
prompted
a
quick
response
from
beijing
that
it
would
retaliate
by
targeting
key
american
imports

i
think
that
the
substance
of
trade
restrictions
and
their
real
impact
will
be
far
less
than
the
headlines
said
jeffery
becker
chairman
and
ceo
at
jennison
associates
in
new
york
and
chinese
cross

trade
has
grown
significantly
over
the
last
decade
and
economic
runs
very
deep
deeper
than
the
actual
trade
numbers
and
both
countries
have
a
lot
to
lose
by
escalating
trade
many
investors
viewed
president
donald
trump
s
latest
tariffs
plan
as
a
part
of
his
negotiation
strategy
rather
than
his
final
policy
indeed
trump
s
top
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
when
asked
whether
the
latest
tariffs
plan
may
never
go
into
effect
and
may
be
a
negotiating
tactic
told
reporters
yes
it
s
possible
it
s
part
of
the
he
called
the
announcements
by
the
two
countries
mere
opening
proposals
the
trade
actions
will
not
be
carried
out
immediately
giving
the
two
countries
room
for
manoeuvrer
the
proposed
percent
tariffs
on
some
industrial
technology
transport
and
medical
products
from
china
now
see
a
public
comment
and
consultation
period
that
is
expected
to
last
around
two
months
our
view
on
the
trade
situation
is
that
typically
the
initial
headline
is
worse
than
what
we
expect
the
implementation
of
ultimately
turn
out
to
be
so
our
expectation
is
it
will
remain
tense
situation
but
will
not
break
out
and
to
an
all
out
trade
war
said
mike
lillard

optimists
also
argued
that
the
global
economy
is
currently
running
so
strong
that
it
could
cope
with
the
impact
of
the
proposed
tariffs
which
cover
a
fraction
on
the
world
s
trade
yet
others
also
cautioned
that
uncertainties
caused
by
fears
of
a
trade
war
could
keep
many
companies
from
capital
expenditures
in
the
near
term
concerns
about
trade
wars
could
also
hit
some
specific
assets
such
as
soybeans
and
corn
which
fell
percent
and
percent
respectively
on
wednesday
after
china
readied
tariffs
