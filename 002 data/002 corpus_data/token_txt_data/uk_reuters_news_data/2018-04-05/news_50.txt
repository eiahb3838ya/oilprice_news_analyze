about
upstream
oil
and
gas
projects
are
expected
to
be
approved
around
the
world
this
year
similar
to
as
operators
stay
focused
on
less
projects
with
quicker
returns
wood
mackenzie
analysts
said
on
thursday
six
of
the
projects
woodmac
expects
in
have
already
been
sanctioned
the
consultancy
said
in
an
annual
review
of
the
upstream
industry
as
well
as
projects
in
britain
norway
israel
and
the
netherlands
the
six
include
china
s
first
wholly
owned
and
operated
deepwater
gas
project
lingshui
and
the
billion
pegaga
gas
project
in
malaysia
oil
and
gas
investment
plunged
more
than
percent
between
and
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
as
crude
oil
prices
slumped
from
above
per
barrel
that
led
many
in
the
industry
to
argue
new
supplies
will
be
scarce
in
the
triggering
price
spikes
operators
have
found
ways
to
grow
in
tough
business
conditions
woodmac
research
director
angus
rodger
said
in
a
statement
accompanying
the
report
the
big
question
is
whether
the
industry
is
actually
spending
projects
approved
in
were
double
the
number
in
as
costs
came
down
oil
prices
rose
and
corporate
finances
improved
woodmac
said
however
average
capital
expenditure
in
dropped
to
billion
the
lowest
in
a
decade
as
operators
focused
on
smaller
projects
and
expansions
of
producing
fields
the
consultancy
said
the
average
breakeven
cost
is
expected
to
fall
by
percent
to
per
barrel
of
oil
equivalent
with
the
most
competitive
projects
in
shallow
waters
off
norway
britain
and
mexico
we
should
continue
to
see
operators
favouring
a
leaner
and
meaner
path
in
investors
and
operators
want
to
see
faster
cycle
times
and
quicker
returns
said
jessica
brewer
a
principal
analyst
at
woodmac
that
notion
was
supported
by
a
reuters
analysis
this
week
which
showed
big
drillers
stuck
close
to
existing
infrastructure
in
their
bids
for
gulf
drilling
leases
gas
and
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
projects
are
likely
to
take
a
bigger
slice
of
overall
investment
with
big
expansion
projects
in
norway
iran
and
oman
woodmac
said
we
can
not
rely
on
smaller
projects
forever
and
when
we
look
at
lng
in
particular
we
see
a
lot
of
big
projects
on
the
horizon
rodger
said
investments
may
pick
up
in
with
projects
such
as
mozambique
lng
canada
lng
and
expansions
in
qatar
and
papua
new
guinea
close
to
final
investment
decisions
the
consultancy
said
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
if
any
of
these
lng
projects
push
for
a
sanction
thereby
lower
costs
and
pipping
the
competition
