thousands
of
oklahoma
teachers
packed
the
state
capitol
on
thursday
to
lobby
lawmakers
in
the
state
for
quick
approval
of
a
revenue
package
they
say
could
end
a
walkout
that
has
closed
public
schools
for
most
of
the
week
chanting
one
day
longer
one
day
stronger
the
teachers
rallied
outside
the
senate
where
debate
is
set
to
start
on
friday
on
the
package
that
includes
higher
hotel
taxes
and
increasing
revenue
from
casinos
the
oklahoma
house
of
representatives
approved
a
million
internet
sales
tax
on
wednesday
as
part
of
a
revenue
package
aimed
at
ending
a
statewide
walkout
by
the
state
s
teachers
who
rank
among
the
lowest
paid
in
the
country
they
are
seeking
higher
wages
and
more
education
funding
the
walkout
now
in
its
fourth
day
is
the
latest
upheaval
by
teachers
in
a
state
after
a
successful
west
virginia
strike
last
month
ended
with
a
pay
raise
scores
of
school
districts
in
oklahoma
will
remain
shuttered
on
friday
including
the
two
largest
our
goal
is
to
fully
deliver
on
a
teacher
pay
raise
republican
oklahoma
senate
majority
leader
greg
treat
told
reporters
we
did
that
last
week
and
we
re
going
to
come
through
this
week
and
replace
the
revenue
that
we
had
to
take
out
to
pass
the
package
he
said
last
week
lawmakers
approved
the
state
s
first
major
tax
increase
in
a
quarter
century
a
million
revenue
package
that
would
have
raised
teacher
pay
by
an
average
of
about
that
was
not
enough
for
the
teachers
seeking
over
three
years
even
with
the
pay
raise
approved
by
lawmakers
they
would
still
receive
lower
mean
salaries
than
teachers
in
every
neighboring
state
bureau
of
labor
statistics
data
showed
a
major
cause
for
the
budget
strain
comes
from
tax
breaks
the
state
has
granted
to
its
energy
industry
which
were
worth
million
in
fiscal
year
alone
oklahoma
has
some
of
the
lowest
taxes
on
oil
and
gas
production
in
the
united
states
in
contrast
to
other
energy
states
that
see
tax
windfalls
during
boom
years
oklahoma
was
not
able
fill
state
coffers
even
when
times
were
good
when
energy
prices
experienced
a
sharp
decline
a
few
years
ago
so
did
oklahoma
tax
revenue
leading
to
deeper
cuts
in
education
spending
which
was
already
on
the
decline
on
a
state
level
the
general
funding
per
student
in
oklahoma
dropped
by
percent
between
and
the
biggest
reduction
of
any
state
according
to
the
nonpartisan
center
on
budget
and
policy
priorities
as
a
consequence
of
low
pay
at
home
and
better
opportunities
across
state
lines
oklahoma
is
grappling
with
a
teacher
shortage
that
has
forced
some
school
districts
to
cut
curricula
go
to
a
school
week
and
deploy
nearly
instructors
as
a
stopgap
measure
