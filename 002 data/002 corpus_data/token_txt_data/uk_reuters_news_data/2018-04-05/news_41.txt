about
accelerating

and
getting
people
to
think
differently
about
food
said
pete
pearson
director
for
food
waste
at
wwf
about
a
third
of
food
produced
around
the
world
is
never
eaten
because
it
is
spoiled
after
harvest
and
in
transportation
or
thrown
away
by
shops
and
consumers
that
amounts
to
economic
losses
of
about
billion
per
year
according
to
the
food
and
agriculture
organization
yet
million
people
around
the
world
go
to
bed
hungry
every
night
figures
show
throwing
out
food
wastes
the
water
energy
and
fuel
required
to
grow
store
and
distribute
it
campaigners
say
while
discarded
food
ends
up
in
landfill
where
it
rots
releasing

practice
leader
with
wwf
international
said
the
conservation
group
best
known
for
its
work
with
wildlife
began
focusing
on
food
because
its
production
is
responsible
for
more
than
percent
of
the
world
s
lost
biodiversity
the
planet
can
not
supply
enough
resources
at
the
rate
we
are
consuming
today
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
hotel
kitchen
which
was
piloted

states
hotel
chefs
worked
to
ensure
menus
for
buffets
and
large
events
could
be
adjusted
quickly
and
some
of
the
excess
food
reused
instead
of
loading
a
buffet
with
cheeses
and
meats
for
example
most
of
it
could
be
kept
fresh
behind
the
