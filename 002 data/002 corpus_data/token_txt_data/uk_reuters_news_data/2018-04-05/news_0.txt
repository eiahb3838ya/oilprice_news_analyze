take
a
look
into
ethics
allegations
against
environmental
protection
agency
administrator
scott
pruitt
over
his
condo
lease
and
other
issues
but
added
the
official
was
doing
a
fantastic
pruitt
has
loyally
executed
trump
s
deregulatory
agenda
with
plans
to
roll
back
programs
cutting
emissions
from
power
plants
and
vehicles
his
efforts
to
slash
regulations
have
helped
make
trump
popular
in
coal
natural
gas
and
states
i
think
that
scott
has
done
a
fantastic
job
trump
told
reporters

one
after
a
trip
to
west
virginia
i
just
left
coal
and
energy
country
they
love
scott
still
trump
said
he
would
make
a
determination
about
the
ethics
issues
the
white
house
is
probing
pruitt
s
lease
of
a
room
in
a
washington
neighborhood
for
a
night
in
a
townhouse
by
the
wife
of
energy
industry
lobbyist
steven
hart
who
lobbies
for
companies
regulated
by
the
epa
pruitt
has
told
the
washington
examiner
in
an
interview
that
he
was
dumbfounded
his
renting
of
the
room
in
a
townhouse
was
controversial
and
said
his
ethics
officials
reviewed
the
lease
but
the
epa
s
ethics
office
suggested
there
still
could
be
questions
about
pruitt
s
housing
arrangement
pruitt
a
vocal
doubter
of
mainstream
climate
change
science
also
is
facing
criticism
for
frequent
air
travel
spending
on
costly
items
in
his
office
including
a
soundproof
telephone
booth
and
for
a
trip
to
morocco
in
which
he
promoted
exports
of
liquefied
natural
gas
while
trump
appears
to
support
pruitt
the
president
can
be
fickle
last
autumn
trump
said
he
had
confidence
in
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
even
after
their
relationship
was
strained
by
differences
of
opinion
on
iran
and
russia
policy
trump
fired
tillerson
in
march
in
late
march
the
epa
s
ethics
office
cleared
pruitt
of
accepting
an
illegal
gift
from
a
lobbyist
with
the
condo
lease
saying
a
number
of
other
rooms
nearby
were
available
for
rent
for
a
similar
or
lower
price
but
the
office
issued
a
memo
dated
on
wednesday
and
seen
by
reuters
that
the
earlier
review
did
not
consider
whether
pruitt
had
violated
other
ethics
rules
with
the
lease
kevin
minoli
a
top
ethics
official
in
the
epa
s
office
of
general
counsel
said
in
the
memo
that
the
review
did
not
address
issues
such
as
a
rule
requiring
officials
to
avoid
behavior
that
could
result
in
their
impartiality
being
questioned
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
federal
ethics
regulations
regarding
impartiality
apply
regardless
of
whether
something
involves
receiving
a
prohibited
gift
he
wrote
in
a
separate
statement
about
the
memo
minoli
said
it
explained
the
ethical
issues
beyond
the
scope
of
the
original
review
the
impartiality
rule
requires
that
government
officials
avoid
doing
things
that
could
create
an
appearance
of
favoritism
in
government
according
to
the
office
of
government
ethics
in
the
memo
first
reported
by
cnn
minoli
also
said
he
did
not
have
access
to
enough
information
to
determine
whether
pruitt
s
actual
use
of
the
townhouse
was
consistent
with
the
lease
trump
s
support
for
pruitt
which
he
also
voiced
on
tuesday
comes
even
as
lawmakers
including
three
fellow
republicans
called
for
his
resignation
over
the
ethics
questions
more
questions
surfaced
as
trump
commented
on
pruitt
five
epa
officials
were
reassigned
demoted
or
requested
new
jobs
over
the
past
year
after
they
complained
about
pruitt
s
spending
a
report
by
the
new
york
times
