hungarian
prime
minister
viktor
orban
leads
the
polls
by
a
mile
his
opposition
is
a
bickering
patchwork
of
smaller
parties
that
won
t
coordinate
and
he
dominates
the
public
agenda
through
his
firm
grip
on
the
media
yet
there
is
still
a
chance
a
slim
chance
that
he
could
lose
his
majority
on
sunday
that
s
because
a
growing
number
of
voters
guided
by
widely
publicised
independent
and
surveys
available
online
may
be
set
to
discard
ideology
and
party
allegiances
to
vote
for
the
candidates
who
are
most
likely
to
win
voters
might
actually
do
what
these

vote
tactically

citibank

would
fail
to
get
a
parliamentary
majority
injecting
an
unexpected
note
of
uncertainty
into
an
election
long
seen
as
a
sure
thing
orban
s
record
is
mixed
he
has
fixed
the
economy
but
unwound
democratic
freedoms
and
while
his
opposition
to
migration
has
earned
him
success
at
home
it
has
sown
distrust
among
his
partners
in
the
european
union
according
to
a
march
poll
by
thinktank
zavecz
research
as
many
as
percent
of
hungarians
voters
want
to
see
a
change
in
government
against
percent
who
want
orban
to
stay
the
remainder
said
they
weren
t
sure
the
forces
who
want
a
change
in
government
have
become
ready
to
cooperate
respected
independent
analyst
gabor
torok
told
the
news
web
site
in
february
the
prime
minister
has
forged
very
strong
ties
with
his
voters
but
in
the
meantime
he
completely
alienated
voters
who
want
a
government
the
key
to
orban
s
success
has
been
positioning
his
party
in
the
centre
against
a
fractured
opposition
of
six
parties
including
leftists
and
the
former
jobbik
in
an
electoral
system
that
tends
to
favour
the
winner
the
potential
for
opposition
success
was
shown
in
february
in
a
municipal
in
the
fidesz
stronghold
of
hodmezovasarhely
when
the
opposition
parties
fielded
one
candidate
and
won
opposition
voters
want
their
parties
to
repeat
the
strategy
nationally
withdrawing
weaker
candidates
to
leave
a
single
challenger
in
each
district
a
survey
from
median
showed
this
week
few
opposition
candidates
have
obliged
although
on
wednesday
the
socialists
and
a
small
liberal
party
egyutt
stepped
aside
in
several
districts
including
the
hotly
contested
budapest
district
that
includes
parliament
and
the
buda
castle
leaving
one
leftist
candidate
and
one
for
jobbik
zavecz
research
published
data
on
wednesday
showing
that
almost
a
third
of
jobbik
supporters
polled
in
march
were
willing
to
support
leftist
candidates
up
from
percent
in
february
leftist
voters
were
even
more
enthusiastic
percent
of
them
said
they
would
vote
for
jobbik
if
need
be
up
from
percent
even
if
fidesz
is
beaten
it
will
remain
the
largest
and
strongest
party
said
republikon
institue
s
toth
various
polls
in
march
showed
fidesz
support
in
the
percent
range
versus
between
to
percent
for
all
the
opposition
put
together
one
million
voters
would
not
comment
forcing
fidesz
into
a
minority
is
possible
to
do
even
under
the
present
scenario
toth
said
if
you
actually
want
to
emerge
either
in
the
left
or
jobbik
as
bigger
than
fidesz
that
requires
coordination
but
that
s
not
a
likely
scenario
hungarian
voters
will
mark
two
ballots
on
sunday
a
list
of
individuals
running
for
seats
from
local
districts
and
parties
on
the
national
list
allocating
seats
the
district
elections
are
decided
first
past
the
post
favouring
the
largest
party
which
also
skews
the
national
list
because
the
winner
is
able
to
pass
to
his
or
her
party
in
the
national
list
those
excess
votes
that
he
or
she
did
not
need
in
fidesz
won
of
the
districts
and
percent
of
the
votes
on
the
national
list
ending
up
with
a
majority
in
parliament
the
splintering
of
the
opposition
is
on
display
in
places
like
miskolc
a
former
industrial
city
in
the
northeast
where
fidesz
jobbik
and
leftist
parties
came
within
five
percentage
points
of
each
other
in
fidesz
won
that
contest
today
polls
suggest
fidesz
and
jobbik
are
in
miskolc
and
if
voters
opt
for
the
strongest
candidate
instead
of
their
favourite
jobbik
could
win
i
really
don
t
care
who
wins
as
long
as
it
s
not
fidesz
said
margit
orehovszki
a
local
pensioner
as
she
headed
for
a
jobbik
street
forum
i
think
jobbik
has
a
better
chance
although
i
like
the
socialists
several
surveys
compiled
by
activist
groups
and
pollsters
using
various
methodologies
including
one
sponsored
by
jobbik
have
yielded
lists
of
the
strongest
candidates
in
the
most
closely
contested
districts
the
results
available
on
a
website
called
orban
must
go
are
generally
similar
adam
sanyo
a
data
analyst
has
built
a
web
site
called
tactical
voting
that
directs
voters
to
opposition
candidates
he
has
identified
as
most
likely
to
win
using
data
from
the
election
and
polls
in
the
to
sunday
his
sparsely
furnished
living
room
is
dominated
by
a
large
electoral
map
and
a
bank
of
screens
notes
signify
districts
where
the
opposition
has
a
chance
budapest
is
nearly
all
pink
indicating
as
many
as
potential
leftist
victories
the
countryside
has
more
than
a
dozen
yellow
jobbik
stickers
a
high
turnout
is
likely
to
benefit
the
opposition
more
than
fidesz
said
gabor
toka
who
led
the
research
effort
of
country
for
all
launched
a
year
ago
by
prominent
activist
marton
gulyas
to
identify
the
strongest
candidates
in
districts
in
eastern
hungary
especially
there
has
been
a
seismic
shift
toka
said
fidesz
is
no
longer
in
the
centre
of
the
political
spectrum
which
means
that
even
if
jobbik
and
the
leftists
attack
one
another
their
voters
are
ready
to
cooperate
against
the
groups
hope
to
reach
million
people
in
a
targeted
social
media
ad
campaign
in
the
days
leading
up
to
sunday
we
know
the
districts
where
this
can
make
a
difference
said
organiser
katalin
igaz
we
need
to
reach
people
who
may
possibly
entertain
tactical
voting
mobilise
them
and
point
them
to
the
strongest
their
advice
is
that
voters
split
their
vote
support
the
strongest
candidate
locally
and
their
party
nationally
if
parties
won
t
agree
on
anything
then
civilians
like
me
must
press
them
or
at
least
show
who
stands
to
win
in
every
district
