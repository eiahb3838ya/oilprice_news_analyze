north

leader
kim
jong
un
told
chinese
president
xi
jinping
during
talks
in
beijing
last
week
that
he
agreed
to
return
to
talks
on
his
nation
s
nuclear
programme
and
missile
tests
the
nikkei
newspaper
said
on
thursday
months
of
chill
between
beijing
and
pyongyang
appeared
to
suddenly
vanish
during
kim
s
secretive
visit
with
china
saying
that
kim
had
pledged
his
commitment
to
denuclearisation
quoting
multiple
sources
connected
to
china
and
north
korea
the
nikkei
said
that
according
to
documents
issued
after
kim
and
xi
met
kim
told
xi
that
he
agreed
to
resuming
the
talks
which
were
last
held
in
north
korea
declared
the
talks
dead
at
the
time
blaming
aggression
the
talks
grouped
the
two
koreas
the
united
states
russia
japan
and
host
china
the
sources
said
it
was
also
possible
that
kim
could
convey
his
willingness
to
resume
the
talks
to
president
donald
trump
at
a
summit
set
to
take
place
in
may
but
that
it
was
far
from
clear
if
that
meant
the
talks
would
actually
resume
chinese
officials
were
not
immediately
able
to
comment
china
has
traditionally
been
secretive
north
korea
s
closest
ally
though
ties
have
been
frayed
by
kim
s
pursuit
of
nuclear
weapons
and
missiles
and
beijing
s
backing
of
tough
sanctions
in
response
north
korea
has
said
in
previous
talks
that
it
could
consider
giving
up
its
nuclear
arsenal
if
the
united
states
removed
its
troops
from
south
korea
and
withdrew
its
nuclear
umbrella
of
deterrence
from
south
korea
and
japan
some
analysts
have
said
trump
s
willingness
to
meet
kim
handed
north
korea
a
diplomatic
win
as
the
united
states
had
insisted
for
years
that
any
such
summit
be
preceded
by
north
korean
steps
to
denuclearise
