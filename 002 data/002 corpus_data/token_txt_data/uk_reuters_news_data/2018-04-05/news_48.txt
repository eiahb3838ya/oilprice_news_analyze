i
think
that
the

restrictions

their

will
be
far
less
than
the

said
jeffery
becker
chairman
and
ceo
at
jennison
associates
in
new
york
and
chinese
trade
has
grown
significantly
over
the
last
decade
and
economic
runs
very
deep
deeper
than
the
actual
trade
numbers
and
both

have
a
lot
to
lose
by
escalating
a
trade
many
suspect
washington
will
likely
back
down

after
beijing
threatened
tariffs
on
soybeans
the
top
agricultural
export
to

it
is
considered
one

arsenal
given
the

on
iowa

states
that

the

will
have
to
tread
cautiously
considering
the
risk
this
could
hurt
election

securities
some
argue
that
the
global
economy
is
currently
running
so
well
that
it
could
cope
with
the
impact
of
the
proposed
tariffs
which
cover
a
fraction
of
world
trade
we
ve
had
a
few
months
now
where

have
really
been
going
sideways
and
progressively
lower
but
at

has
data
really
rolled
over

no
geoffrey

the
