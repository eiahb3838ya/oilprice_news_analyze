the
number
of
plastic
bags
found
in
the
seas
around
britain
has
significantly
dropped
since
as
european
governments
crack
down
on
their
use
researchers
said
on
thursday
the
percentage
of
trawls
by
fishermen
that
catch
at
least
one
plastic
bag
in
the
greater
north
sea
off
britain
s
east
coast
more
than
halved
since
to
percent
scientists
in
britain
and
the
netherlands
said
prior
to
the
average
was
percent
said
the
study
which
spanned
years
several
european
countries
including
ireland
denmark
france
and
britain
have
introduced
plastic
bag
levies
since
which
have
led
to
massive
reductions
in
their
use
the
action
of
all
these
nations
meant
there
are
less
bags
being
distributed
less
bags
escaping
into
the
marine
environment
thomas
maes
of
the
study
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
if
we
think
a
bit
more
wisely
about
plastic
especially
the
single
use
items
we
use
in
our
daily
life
we
can
make
big
changes
said
the
marine
scientist
at
britain
s
governmental
centre
for
environment
fisheries
and
aquaculture
science
united
nations
figures
show
million
tonnes
of
plastic
bottles
packaging
and
other
waste
enter
the
ocean
each
year
killing
marine
life
and
entering
the
human
food
chain
scientists
have
urged
tougher
restrictions
on
plastic
waste
in
december
almost
nations
agreed
to
limit
plastic
pollution
of
the
oceans
warning
it
could
outweigh
fish
by
in
contrast
to
plastic
bags
the
researchers
found
the
amount
of
plastic
fishing
debris
including
nets
floats
buoys
caught
has
risen
measures
introduced
to
curb
this
will
take
a
while
to
have
an
impact
maes
said
several
european
countries
have
introduced
deposit
return
schemes
for
single
use
bottles
in
a
bid
to
increase
recycling
britain
said
it
plans
to
follow
later
this
year
as
plastic
is
wreaking
havoc
on
the
marine
environment
killing
dolphins
choking
turtles
and
degrading
precious
habitats
plastics
which
have
been
in
the
seas
for
a
while
may
sink
into
the
sea
floor
or
be
torn
up
and
gradually
turned
into
microplastics
they
can
take
hundreds
of
years
to
degrade
cleaning
up
the
oceans
is
a
very
complex
issue
but
the
crucial
thing
is
to
stop
more
plastic
waste
entering
the
seas
and
then
think
about
cleaning
it
up
