sentiment
was
lifted
as
the
united
states
expressed
willingness

to
the

after
the

from

that
it
would
retaliate

i
think
that
the
substance
of
trade
restrictions
and
their
real
impact
will
be
far
less
than
the
headlines
said
jeffery
becker
chairman
and
ceo
at
jennison
associates
in
new
york
and
chinese
cross
border
trade
has
grown
significantly
over
the
last
decade
and
economic
runs
very
deep
deeper
than
the
actual
trade
numbers
and
both
countries
have
a
lot
to
lose
by
escalating
a
trade
many
investors
viewed
president
donald
trump
s
latest
tariffs
plan
as
part
of
his
negotiation
strategy
rather
than
his
final
policy
indeed
trump
s
top
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
when
asked
whether
the
latest
tariffs
plan
may
never
go
into
effect
and
may
be
a
negotiating
tactic
told
reporters
yes
it
s
possible
it
s
part
of
the
he
called
the
announcements
by
the
two
countries
mere
opening
proposals
the
trade
actions
will
not
be
carried
out
immediately
giving
the
two
countries
room
for
manoeuvre
and
providing
investors
with
hope
of
a
compromise
the
proposed
percent
tariffs
on
some
industrial
technology
transport
and
medical
products
from
china
now
see
a
public
comment
and
consultation
period
that
is
expected
to
last
around
two
months
our
view
on
the
trade
situation
is
that
typically
the
initial
headline
is
worse
than
what
we
expect
the
implementation
to
ultimately
turn
out
to
be
so
our
expectation
is
it
will
remain
a
tense
situation
but
will
not
break
out
and
to
an
all
out
trade
war
said
mike
lillard
chief
investment
officer
at

in

new

many
suspect
washington
will
likely
back
down
on
some
fronts
after
beijing
threatened
tariffs
on
soybeans
the
top
agricultural
export
to
china
it
is
considered
one
of
the
most
powerful
weapons
in
beijing
s
trade
arsenal
given
the
impact
on
iowa
and
other
farming
states
that
backed
trump
in
the
election
the
administration
will
have
to
tread
cautiously
considering
the
risk
this
could
hurt
the
election
prospects
said
yukino
yamada
senior
strategist
at
daiwa
securities
optimists
also
argued
that
the
global
economy
is
currently
running
so
strong
that
it
could
cope
with
the
impact
of
the
proposed
tariffs
which
cover
a
fraction
of
the
world

trade
economic
data

also
cautioned
that
uncertainties
caused
by
fears
of
a
trade
war
could
result
in
many
companies
delaying

investments
in

concerns
about

could
also
hit
some
