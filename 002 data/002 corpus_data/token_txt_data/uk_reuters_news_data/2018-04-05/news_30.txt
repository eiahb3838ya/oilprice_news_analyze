a
coal
ship
that
dropped
anchor
off
the
coast
of
the
indonesian
port
city
of
balikpapan
on
borneo
island
was
likely
to
blame
for
an
oil
spill
after
dragging
a
pipeline
more
than
meters
and
causing
it
to
crack
an
energy
ministry
official
said
indonesia
declared
a
state
of
emergency
this
week
after
the
spill
and
fire
killed
five
fishermen
the
environment
ministry
said
the
oil
covered
an
area
of
nearly
hectares
and
had
polluted
km
of
coastal
ecosystems
including
mangrove
wetlands
and
marine
mammal
habitats

suspect
the
pipe
was
dragged

director

djoko
siswanto
told
reporters
on
thursday
at
the
time
it
was
bad
weather
so
they
had
to
drop
anchor
siswanto
said
noting
it
was
an
area
where
ships
were
not
supposed
to
anchor
siswanto
did
not
identify
the
vessel
but
said
it
was
a
coal
ship
with
a
panama
flag

a
bustling
mining
and
energy
hub
sitting
on
a
shipping
lane
serving
one
of
indonesia
s
biggest
thermal
coal
mining
regions
pertamina
had
at
first
said
initial
tests
showed
the
oil
was
marine
oil
used
in
boats
but
on
wednesday
said
a
cracked
underwater
pipeline
linked
to
its
refinery
in
balikpapan
was
the
source
by
tuesday
night
around
cubic
meters
of
spilled
oil
had
been
contained
by
a
team
from
several
oil
companies
operating
in
the
area
and
government
agencies
the
environment
ministry
said
thick
clumps
of
oil
were
still
visible
in
some
areas
on
thursday
but
much
less
than
the
several
days
prior
environment
minister
siti
nurbaya
said
in
a
statement
the
ministry
which
is
responsible
for
supervising
the
cleanup
and

contain
the
remaining

said
oil
and
gas
director
general
siswanto
said
the
spill
had
been
stopped
and
the
remains
of
the
oil
spill
are
still
being
cleaned
up
he
did
not
estimate
how
much
oil
had
spilled
the
spill
had
reduced
the
operational
capacity
of
the
balikpapan
oil
refinery
a
pertamina
official
said
a
second
smaller
undamaged
pipeline
running
next
to
the
broken
pipe
was
being
used
to
deliver
crude
to
the
refinery
with
additional
oil
supplied
via
tankers
siswanto
said
some
green
groups
have
criticized
pertamina
for
not
taking
responsibility
for
the
spill
siswanto
said
pertamina
had
been
late
in
announcing
the
source
of
the
oil
but
said
the
government
was
investigating
the
company
that
owned
the
vessel
suspected
of
breaking
the
state
company
s
pipeline
the
vessel
owners
would
be
questioned
and
could
be
charged
over
the
deaths
resulting
from
the
spill
he
said
it
depends
on
who
was
to
blame
it
depends
on
the
investigation
