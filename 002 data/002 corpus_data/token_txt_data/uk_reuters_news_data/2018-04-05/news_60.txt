is
the

largest
exporter

it
said
in
december
it
had
taken
a
preliminary
decision
to
withdraw
from

full
review
the

came
under
pressure
from
australian
green
groups
last
year
to
leave
any
industry
associations
with
policies
that
fail
to
match
the
company
s
support
of
the
paris
climate
accord
in
light
of
the
material
difference
identified
by
the

and
the
narrow
range
of
activities
of
benefit
to
bhp
from
membership
bhp
has
reached
a
final
view
that
it
will
cease
membership
of
the
wca
bhp
said
in
a
statement
the
wca
said
it
was
disappointed
with
bhp

decision
especially
given
that
bhp
had
been
involved
in
developing
the
association
s
position
on
energy
and
climate
change
the
wca
s
position
has
always
been
clear
we
support
a
balanced
approach
that
integrates
climate
and
energy
policy
that
works
towards
a
low
emission
future
said
benjamin
sporton
chief
executive
of
the

we
believe
a
balanced
approach
should
not
exclude
high
efficiency
low
emissions
power
generation
and
carbon
capture
and
storage

said
bhp
said
that
while
it
had
identified
material
differences
in
its
stance
with
the
chamber
of
commerce
the
largest
business
lobby
there
were
other
benefits
from
the
activities
with
the
group
on
the
basis
of
these
broader
benefits
and
in
light
of
the
chamber
s
willingness
to
engage
further
on
climate
and
energy
issues
through
an
invitation
extended
to
bhp
to
join
its
energy
and
environment
committee
bhp
has
determined
to
remain
a
member
of
the
chamber
bhp
said
bhp
said
it
would
also
continue
to
work
with
the
minerals
council
of
australia
in
relation
to
its
updated
energy
and
climate
policy
