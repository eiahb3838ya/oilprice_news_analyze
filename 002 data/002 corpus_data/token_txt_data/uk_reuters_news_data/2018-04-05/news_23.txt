solar power eclipsed fossil fuels in new 2017 generating capacity-un

chinese
solar
power
led
a
record
gigawatts
gw
of
new
renewable
energy
capacity
added
worldwide
last
year
more
than
double
the
amount
of
new
generation
capacity
from
fossil
fuels
a
report
showed
on
thursday
globally
a
record
gw
of
solar
power
capacity
was
installed
last
year
with
china
contributing
more
than
half
or
gw
according
to
environment
the
frankfurt
collaborating
centre
and
bloomberg
new
energy
finance
the
new
renewable
energy
generating
capacity
also
including
wind
biofuels
and
geothermal
energy
dwarfed
the
gw
of
net
new
capacity
from
fossil
fuels
in
it
said
we
are
at
a
turning
point
from
fossil
fuels
to
the
renewable
world
erik
solheim
head
of
environment
told
reuters
the
markets
are
there
and
renewables
can
take
on
coal
they
can
take
on
oil
and
fossil
fuels
however
still
dominate
existing
capacity
solar
wind
biomass
and
other
renewables
generated
percent
of
world
electricity
in
up
from
percent
a
decade
earlier
it
said
climate
scientists
have
advised
governments
that
renewables
should
be
the
world
s
dominant
source
of
energy
by
if
they
want
to
achieve
the
toughest
goals
set
under
the
paris
climate
agreement
to
combat
global
warming
global
investment
in
renewable
energy
rose
by
two
percent
to
billion
in
from
a
year
earlier
china
invested
the
most
in
renewables
at
billion
its
largest
amount
ever
and
percent
of
the
global
total
much
lower
costs
are
the
driver
of
solar
investment
worldwide
said
angus
mccrone
chief
editor
of
bloomberg
new
energy
finance
and
lead
author
of
the
report
told
reuters
and
solar
power
in
china
benefited
from
government
policies
to
help
industry
reduce
air
pollution
and
slow
climate
change
he
said
the
report
said
the
cost
of
generating
electricity
from
solar
photovoltaic
technology
fell
by
percent
last
year
to
per
megawatt
hour
in
the
united
states
renewable
energy
investment
fell
by
six
percent
in
to
billion
however
it
was
relatively
resilient
to
policy
uncertainties
under
president
donald
trump
who
wants
to
promote
fossil
fuels
the
report
said
trump
can
no
more
brake
this
than
those
who
opposed
the
industrial
revolution
could
stop
the
industrial
revolution
said
solheim
a
former
norwegian
environment
minister
still
trump
s
decision
in
january
to
slap
tariffs
on
imported
solar
panels
could
dent
solar
power
in
the
short
term
mccrone
said
but
there
was
no
sign
the
congress
would
scrap
tax
credits
for
renewables
that
are
a
bigger
driver
of
investment
he
said
europe
s
investment
in
renewables
plunged
by
percent
to
billion
due
to
factors
including
the
end
of
subsidies
in
some
countries
for
solar
and
wind
and
lower
technology
costs
in
europe
the
fall
in
investment
is
strongly
driven
by
germany
and
the
uk
