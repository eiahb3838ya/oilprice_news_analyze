the
dollar
gained
and
equity
markets
around
the
world
jumped
on
thursday
in
a
relief
rally
as
fears
eased
of
a

between
china
and
the

after
washington
expressed
a
willingness
to
negotiate

seem

rally
mode
and
part
of
this
is
really
driven
by
the
fact
we
re
not
really
in
a
trade
war
yet
said
charlie
ripley

at

in

this
is
quite
small
in
terms
of
the
impact
to
the

still
have
the
runway

joe
manimbo
senior
market
analyst
at
western
union
business
solution
in
washington
said
the
dollar
was
boosted
by
a
view
that
washington
and
beijing
might
broker
a
trade
deal
that
doesn
t
torpedo
global
commerce
or
damage
the
world
crude
rose
cents
to
per
barrel
and
brent
gained
cents
to
gold
prices
fell
as
the
apparent
willingness
to
resolve
a
trade
dispute
reduced
demand
for
bullion
as
a
place
to
park
money
a
stronger
dollar
also
crimped
gold
as
it
s
more
expensive
for
users
of
other
currencies
gold
futures
fell
to
an
ounce
many
suspect
washington
will
likely
back
down
on
some
fronts
after
beijing
threatened
tariffs
on
soybeans
the
top
agricultural
export
to
china
threats
to
such
exports
are
a
powerful
weapon
for
beijing
to
wield
given
the
potential
impact
on
iowa
and
other
farming
states
that
backed
trump
in
the
presidential
election
soybeans
and
corn
regained
ground
following
