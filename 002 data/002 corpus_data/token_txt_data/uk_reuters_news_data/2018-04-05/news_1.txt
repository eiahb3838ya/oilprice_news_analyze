u.s. epa sued by 14 states over delay in methane emission standards
reuters
fourteen
states
filed
suit
on
thursday
accusing
the
environmental
protection
agency
of
failing
to
issue
regulations
for
curbing
emissions
of
methane
a
potent
greenhouse
pollutant
from
existing
oil
and
gas
operations
as
required
under
the
clean
air
act
the
legal
challenge
led
by
new
york
state
came
nine
months
after
a
federal
appeals
court
sided
with
environmental
activists
who
sued
to
block
the
epa
from
freezing
enforcement
of
its
own
rules
to
control
methane
leaks
from
new
or
modified
fossil
fuel
facilities
in
both
instances
epa
chief
scott
pruitt
has
been
accused
of
putting
the
interests
of
oil
and
gas
companies
ahead
of
the
agency
s
obligation
to
protect
air
quality
including
the
control
of
pollutants
that
scientists
blame
for
global
climate
change
pruitt
who
was
a
leading
epa
critic
as
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
before
beginning
his
tenure
as
head
of
the
epa
has
said
he
does
not
believe
greenhouse
gas
emissions
are
the
principal
driver
of
climate
change
as
epa
administrator
pruitt
has
moved
to
carry
out
president
donald
trump
s
campaign
pledge
to
roll
back
or
reconsider
a
slew
of
environmental
protections
deemed
burdensome
by
the
industry
including
climate
change
regulations
in
march
trump
signed
an
order
to
undo
climate
rules
and
the
epa
that
month
halted
efforts
to
collect
data
from
fossil
fuel
operations
to
prepare
performance
standards
that
states
would
have
to
follow
in
devising
measures
for
existing
wells
pipelines
storage
tanks
pumping
stations
and
other
facilities
it
was
epa
s
unreasonable
delay
in
developing
those
standards
that
thursday
s
lawsuit
filed
in
district
court
in
washington
cited
as
a
clean
air
act
violation
the
epa
has
a
clear
legal
duty
to
control
methane
pollution
from
oil
and
gas
operations
new
york
attorney
general
eric
schneiderman
said
its
continued
refusal
to
do
so
is
not
only
illegal
but
threatens
our
public
health
and
the
lawsuit
prepared
by
his
office
was
joined
by
california
and
other
states
including
illinois
pennsylvania
new
mexico
vermont
and
iowa
as
well
as
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
city
of
chicago
pruitt
was
named
as
the
sole
defendant
in
the
complaint
which
seeks
a
court
order
compelling
the
epa
to
devise
and
issue
the
emissions
standards
in
question
an
epa
spokeswoman
said
the
agency
does
not
comment
on
pending
litigation
methane
the
main
component
of
commercially
distributed
natural
gas
is
also
a
byproduct
of
oil
extraction
pound
for
pound
it
traps
significantly
more
heat
in
the
atmosphere
than
carbon
dioxide
the
most
prevalent
greenhouse
gas
though
its
effects
are
the
oil
and
gas
industry
accounts
for
nearly
third
of
all
methane
emissions
according
to
an
epa
report
cited
in
the
lawsuit
the
overwhelming
bulk
of
those
emissions
equivalent
to
million
metric
tons
of
carbon
dioxide
each
year
come
from
facilities
in
existence
prior
to
the
complaint
said
the
lawsuit
cited
an
environmental
defense
fund
study
that
found
the
industry
could
cut
methane
emissions
percent
below
projected
levels
at
an
average
annual
cost
of
less
than
a
penny
per
thousand
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas
produced
the
study
said
that
reduction
could
save
the
economy
more
than
million

year
