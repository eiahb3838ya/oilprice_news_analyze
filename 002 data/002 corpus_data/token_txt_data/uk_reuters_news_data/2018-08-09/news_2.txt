new
sanctions
against
moscow
drove
down
russia
s
ruble
while
worries
that
turkey
was
sliding
into
a
economic
crisis
battered
the
lira
on
thursday
but
global
equity
markets
largely
shrugged
off
the
turmoil
to
edge
higher
the
russian
ruble
slid
percent
after
washington
said
it
would
impose
fresh
sanctions
because
it
had
determined
that
moscow
had
used
a
nerve
agent
against
a
former
russian
agent
and
his
daughter
in
britain
which
the
kremlin
denies
the
ruble
slid
to
its
lowest
since
late
hitting
rubles
to
the
dollar
leaving
it
after
a
second
day
of
declines
more
than
percent
weaker
than
it
had
been
late
on
tuesday
turkey
s
lira
touched
a
record
low
against
the
dollar
weakening
percent
in
hours
after
meetings
in
washington
looked
to
have
made
little
progress
in
mending
a
row
over
ankara
s
jailing
of
an
american
pastor
politics
continues
to
wreak
havoc
in
global
fx
markets
said

a

strategist
at

ing
we
re
questioning
whether
any

msci
s
world
stock
index
fell
percent
after
trading
flat
for
most
of
the
session
european
shares
earlier
in
the
session
were
lower
but
later
pared
most
losses
the
ftseurofirst

of
leading
regional

closed
up
percent
as
did
the
euro
stoxx
on
wall
street
the
benchmark
s
p
index
edged
lower
but
remained
about
half
a
percentage
point
from
breaching
an
high
that
was
set
in
january
while
the
nasdaq
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
percent
away
from
a
record
peak
with
the
earnings
season
mostly
over
investors
have
turned
their
attention
from
solid
economic
growth
and
corporate
profits
to
other
risks
said
michael
arone
chief
investment
strategist
at
state
street
global
advisors
in
boston
the
latter
half
of
august
into
september
is
notoriously
volatile
and
associated
with
potential
market
hiccups
he
said
it
wouldn
t
surprise
me
to
see
the
market
struggle
to
move
much
higher
from
here
even
if
we
do
breach
the
highs
until
we
get
around
to
the
next
earnings
seasons
arone
said
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
fell
points
or
percent
to
the
s
p
lost
points
or

to
and
the
nasdaq
composite
added
points
or
percent
to
emerging
market
securities
were
mostly
weaker
as
the
lira
and
ruble
tumbled
but
analysts
didn
t
see
the
in
latin
american
and
other
currencies
as
an
spillover
i
don
t
necessarily
see
this
as
the
start
of
something
broader
but
yes
today
what
seemed
to
be
a
few
pockets
of
weakness
has
spread
across
the
board
said
ilya
gofshteyn
macro
strategist
at
standard
chartered
bank
in
new
york
the
reason
i
don
t
expect
em
to
start
rolling
over
is
investor
concerns
from
a
few
months
ago
have
abated
a
bit
he
said
oil
prices
were
down
slightly
as
the
escalating
