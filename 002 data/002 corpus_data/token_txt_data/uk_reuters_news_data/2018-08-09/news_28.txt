the
united
nations
puts
out
fake
science
about
climate
change
to
control
the
global
energy
market
and
wind
and
solar
energy
are
simply
dumb
these
are
among
the
messages
that
flowed
from
the
america
first
energy
conference
in
new
orleans
this
week
hosted
by
some
of
the
country
s
most
vocal
climate
change
doubters

of
trump
administration
officials
the

and
the
center
for
industrial
progress
along
with
officials
from
the
department
of
interior
and
the
white
house
for
panels
that
included
carbon
taxes
cap
trade
and
other
bad
ideas
fiduciary
malpractice
the
sustainable
investment
movement
and
why
emissions
are
not
creating
a
climate
the
conference
reflected
the
political
rise
of
global
warming
skeptics
in
donald
trump
s
america
that
is
occurring
despite
mounting
scientific
evidence
including
from
government
agencies
that
burning
oil
coal
and
natural
gas
is
heating
the
planet
and
leading
to
drought
floods
wildfires
and
more
frequent
powerful
storms
a
similar
conference
blasting
the
link
between
fossil
fuels
and
climate
change
last
year
drew
protection
agency
chief
scott
pruitt
who
was
appointed
by
trump
to
reverse
climate
initiatives
and
roll
back
regulation
hindering
drillers
and
miners
but
who
has
since
resigned
in
a
flurry
of
ethical
controversies
the
officials
who
joined
included
white
house
special
assistant
brooke
rollins
interior
department
assistant
secretary
joe
balash
and
jason
funes
an
assistant
in
the
office
of
external
affairs
at
interior
they
praised
the
administration
s
moves
to
clear
the
way
for
oil
industry
activity
and
steered
clear
of
commenting
on
climate
change
but
their
presence
gave
climate
change
doubters
at
the
conference
a
boost
it
s
a
step
in
the
right
direction
said
climate
change
doubter
roy
spencer
a
principal
research
scientist
at
the
university
of
alabama
referring
to
the
officials
in
attendance
in
an
email
interior
department
spokeswoman
heather
swift
said
department
officials
speak
at
thousands
of
conferences
every
year
and
share
ideas
with
a
diverse
group
of
a
white
house
spokesperson
did
not
immediately
comment
tim
huelskamp
president
and
ceo
of
the
heartland
institute
said
the
views
presented
at
the
conference
once
on
the
fringes
of
politics
would
be
proven
right
the
leftist
claims
about
sea
level
rise
are
overblown
overstated
or
frankly
just
wrong
he
said
in
an
interview
regarding
the
united
nations
findings
on
climate
change
he
said
it
was
fake
science
motivated
by
a
desire
for
power
and
evidence
of
sea
level
rise
however
is
strewn
across
the
state
that
hosted
the
conference
new
orleans
has
been
ravaged
repeatedly
by
hurricanes
that
scientists
say
will
become
stronger
and
more
frequent
due
to
climate
change
and
the
rest
of
louisiana
is
losing
coastline
at
one
of
the
fastest
rates
on
the
planet
due
to
sea
level
rise
and
encroaching
industry
according
to
the
national
oceanographic
and
atmospheric
administration
it
s
a
nice
world
they
live
in

an
environmental
consortium
involved
in

programs
referring
to
the
attendees
of
the
america
first

conference
it
s
not
the
world
we
live
the
governor
s
office
of
louisiana
a
state
that
has
earmarked
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
to
fend
off
coastal
erosion
and
relocate
a
native
american
tribe
from
a
sinking
offshore
island
did

for
the

book
series
attendees
also
passed
around
a
book
titled
dumb
energy
a
rant
against
wind
and
solar
the
more
than
speakers
praised
trump
for
withdrawing
from
the
paris
climate
accords
a
global
agreement
to
fight
climate
change
mainly
by
cutting
carbon
emissions
and
for
rolling
back
regulations
to
allow
oil
companies
to
lead
the
biggest
energy
surge
in
the
nation
s
history
but
they
warned
that
proponents
of
the
oil
and
gas
boom
are
still
locked
in
an
epic
struggle
with
climate
activists
in
academia
and
within
federal
agencies
the
deep
state
is
real
said
congressman
clay
higgins
a
louisiana
republican
addressing
the
conference
they
re
certainly
higgins
joked
about
renewable
energy
sources
like
wind
and
solar
saying
there
is
probably
a
conference
somewhere
in
the
united
states
where
people
are
talking
about
how
the
future
of
the
world
s
engine
will

and
unicorn
david
legates
professor
of
climatology
at
the
university
of
delaware
argued
that
increased
carbon
dioxide
emissions
will
not
only
leave
the
planet
unharmed
but
benefit
plant
life
by
allowing
them
to
consume
water
more
efficiently
so
you
would
expect
therefore
that
this
will
be
a
greener
planet
legates
said
funes
of
the
interior
department
spoke
on
a
panel
called
the
future
of
coal
oil
and
natural
gas
alongside
joe
leimkuhler
vice
president
of
drilling
at
llog
exploration
and
fred
palmer
who
joined

oil
production
under
president
trump
has
increased
million
barrels
per
day
since
the
beginning
of
his
administration
funes
said
the
is
exporting
four
times
as
much
oil
as
it
exported
a
decade
on
the
sidelines
of
the
conference
funes
said
he
only
attended
the
conference
to
speak
about
the
nation
s
surging
oil
production
and
he
refused
to
comment
about
the
views
of
other
speakers
efforts
to
reach
balash
and
rollins
were
unsuccessful
but
on
the
dinner
keynote
address
balash
embraced
the
most
obvious
mutual
terrain
between
the
conference
organizers
and
the
trump
administration
the
deregulation
push
last
year
this
administration
rolled
back
regulations
for
every
one
that
it
proposed
balash
said
unfortunately
i
think
we
need
about
a
decade
of
that
to
get
back
to
a
reasonable
