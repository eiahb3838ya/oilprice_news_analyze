the
administration
performance
in
these
years
has
led
the
country
to
be
considered
untrustworthy
and
unreliable
around
the
world
which
does
not
meet
any
of
its
obligations
rouhani
was
quoted
by
the
islamic
republic
news
agency
irna

telling
ri
on
wednesday
in
the
current
situation
friendly
countries
should
develop
their
relations
and
cooperation
in
the
international
community

have
since
struggled

council
resolutions
and
sanctions

pullout

an
action

strategic
policy
is
to
deepen

with
the
islamic
republic
of

the
deal
including
washington
s
main
european
allies
britain
france
and
germany
as
well
as
