agl
energy
australia
s
biggest
power
producer
said
annual
profit
jumped
nearly
a
third
to
a
record
amid
soaring
prices
that
have
brought
growing
political
heat
on
the
firm
and
its
peers
to
slash
household
electricity
bills
but
agl
shares
slumped
percent
on
thursday
as
it
warned
it
expects
almost
no
profit
growth
this
year
with
wholesale
prices
dropping
and
a
retail
war
persisting
the
record
result
came
a
day
ahead
of
a
key
meeting
of
state
energy
ministers
to
consider
a
policy
designed
to
boost
power
supply
and
lower
prices
while
cutting
carbon
emissions
ending
a
decade
of
dispute
between
green
energy
proponents
and
those
focused
on
costs
and
security
of
supply
policy
certainty
is
key
to
encouraging
further
investment
in
generation
supply
which
will
place
downward
pressure
on
electricity
prices
and
ultimately
benefit
customers
agl
chief
executive
andy
vesey
told
analysts
agl
backs
the
new
policy
dubbed
the
national
energy
guarantee
the
company
reported
an
underlying
profit
of
a
billion
million
for
the
year
ended
june
above
analysts
forecasts
but
its
outlook
for
a
profit
between
a
million
and
a
billion
for
fiscal
was
weaker
than
expected
sending
its
shares
lower
in
a
broader
market
that
was
trading
higher
it
does
show
there
are
pressures
in
the
business
eating
away
at
it
that
s
why
guidance
was
a
bit
tepid
versus
expectations
but
it
s
still
a
good
profit
said
jason
teh
chief
investment
officer
at
vertium
asset
management
which
does
not
own
agl
shares
citing
the
challenges
the
company
faces
agl
said
high
wholesale
power
prices
over
the
past
year
were
largely
due
to
the
shutdown
of
two
power
stations
over
the
previous
two
years
but
said
prices
had
peaked
at
the
same
time
it
warned
that
an
ongoing
war
for
household
and
business
customers
where
its
biggest
rivals
are
origin
energy
and
energy
australia
will
eat
into
its
profit
margin
we
believe
the
level
of
competitive
intensity
we
see
in
the
market
now
will
continue
vesey
said
to
offset
the
margin
squeeze
agl
has
set
out
to
cut
operating
costs
by
percent
over
the
next
three
years
with
a
million
in
cuts
targeted
for
this
year
while
facing
heat
to
cut
household
power
bills
agl
has
also
been
pressed
by
the
government
to
keep
its
ageing
liddell
power
station
open
beyond
or
sell
it
to
ensure
there
is
for
intermittent
wind
and
solar
power
generation
agl
has
instead
opted
to
replace
liddell
s
capacity
with
a
a
billion
combination
of
plants
an
upgrade
of
another
plant
renewable
power
and
possibly
some
energy
storage
including
pumped
