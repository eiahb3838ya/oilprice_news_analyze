column-china's commodity imports stay resilient, but u.s. trade dispute looms: russell

it
s
tempting
to
look
at
china
s
imports
of
major
commodities
in
july
and
conclude
that
the
strength
is
a
sign
that
the
escalating
trade
dispute
with
the
united
states
isn
t
having
much
of
an
impact
while
the
first
of
the
tariffs
came
into
effect
in
july
it
will
likely
take
several
months
before
any
real
impact
is
discernable
and
even
then
separating
out
the
effect
of
trade
measures
from
other
factors
will
be
tricky
in
the
meantime
the
commodity
trade
data
can
still
provide
insight
to
china
s
economy
and
it
s
largely
painting
a
picture
of
resilience
imports
of
crude
oil
rose
slightly
in
july
to
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
up
from
june
s
million
according
to
customs
data
released
on
wednesday
graphic
trends
in
china
trade
economy
however
the
market
chose
to
focus
more
on
the
fact
that
july
was
the
month
this
year
and
that
the
smaller
independent
refiners
known
as
teapots
have
cut
back
on
their
purchases
a
combination
of
higher
crude
prices
and
changes
in
government
taxes
have
been
blamed
for
the
weak
growth
in
crude
imports
and
these
factors
have
certainly
tilted
the
playing
field
against
smaller
refiners
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
china
s
exports
of
refined
products
slipped
in
july
to
million
tonnes
which
equates
to
about
million
bpd
using
a
conversion
factor
of
barrels
of
product
per
tonne
of
crude
this
was
down
from
about
million
bpd
in
june
showing
that
some
of
the
softness
in
crude
imports
can
be
ascribed
to
a
slowing
in
the
exports
of
refined
fuels
where
there
was
unambiguous
strength
in
china
s
commodity
imports
was
in
iron
ore
and
coal
iron
ore
imports
rebounded
to
million
tonnes
in
july
from
million
in
june
although
they
are
still
down
percent
for
the
first
seven
months
of
the
year
compared
to
the
same
period
in
the
robust
imports
of
iron
ore
can
largely
be
ascribed
to
near
record
margins
for
steel
producers
and
record
output
as
mills
try
to
maximise
profits
an
ongoing
switch
to
higher
grade
iron
ore
by
mills
seeking
to
boost
output
while
minimising
emissions
has
also
favoured
imported
iron
ore
over
domestic
output
which
tends
be
low
quality
lower
prices
for
iron
ore
during
may
and
june
when
july
delivery
cargoes
would
have
been
arranged
may
also
have
contributed
to
the
surge
in
imports
coal
imports
leapt
to
the
highest
in
years
increasing
percent
from
june
to
million
tonnes
in
july
the
surge
can
largely
be
put
down
to
the
heatwave
afflicting
much
of
the
northern
hemisphere
with
china
boosting
power
generation
from
thermal
plants
to
cope
with
the
additional
demand
for
curbs
on
domestic
output
have
also
encouraged
imports
with
the
latest
available
data
showing
production
fell
percent
in
june
to
an
low
the
preliminary
customs
data
released
on
wednesday
also
doesn
t
break
down
the
types
of
coal
being
imported
and
official
details
on
this
have
not
been
released
since
march
however
it
s
likely
that
in
addition
to
strong
demand
for
thermal
coal
for
power
generation
imports
of
coking
coal
for
have
been
rising
as
well
this
is
because
domestic
coking
coal
output
has
been
dropping
with
a
percent
slide
reported
in
june
and
production
for
the
first
six
months
slipping
percent
from
the
same
period
in
the
major
industrial
commodity
most
exposed
to
any
pullback
from
the
trade
dispute
with
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
is
copper
but
so
far
this
hasn
t
happened
imports
of
unwrought
copper
rose
percent
in
july
to
tonnes
while
inbound
shipments
of
copper
ores
and
concentrates
were
up
percent
to
million
tonnes
given
copper
s
importance
in
manufacturing
and
construction
any
sign
of
weakness
in
chinese
demand
would
raise
concerns
about
the
impact
of
the
trade
dispute
overall
china
s
commodity
imports
aren
t
raising
any
red
flags
even
if
the
strength
in
coal
and
iron
ore
looks
to
be
partly
the
result
of
temporary
factors
but
it
s
early
days
yet
in
the
trade
dispute
and
it
s
likely
that
imports
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
this
year
may
be
more
instructive
as
to
any
impact
