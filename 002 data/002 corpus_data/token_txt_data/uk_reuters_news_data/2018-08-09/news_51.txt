aug
reuters
at
least
four
cargoes
of
coal
worth
million
are
headed
to
china
as
beijing
prepares
to
hit
imports
with
hefty
tariffs
threatening
a
niche
supply
of
the
fuel
even
as
china
s
appetite
for
foreign
coal
shows
no
sign
of
abating
the
vessels
carrying
a
combined
tonnes
of
coal
are
the
only
confirmed
cargoes
in
transit
from
the
united
states
to
china
and
are
scheduled
to
land
in
time
to
avoid
the
new
duties
on
wednesday
night
the
ministry
of
commerce
published
its
final
list
of
items
worth
billion
in
imports
that
will
incur
an
additional
tariff
including
coal
the
penalties
will
come
into
effect
on
after
washington
plans
to
start
collecting
duties
on
chinese
products
of
the
same
value
coal
was
also
in
the
draft
list
issued
in
june
china
s
coal
imports
have
soared
as
domestic
output
has
flagged
while
searing
summer
temperatures
have
fuelled
demand
from
utilities
data
on
wednesday
showed
arrivals
hit
their
highest
in
more
than
four
years
in
july
but
the
new
duties
are
likely
to
curb
exports
from
the
united
states
which
ramped
up
shipments
in
as
its
beleaguered
coal
mining
sector
has
undergone
a
resurgence
under
president
donald
trump
the
united
states
shipped
million
tonnes
of
coal
to
china
last
year
up
from
less
than
tonnes
in
making
it
china
s
seventh
largest
supplier
although
well
behind
top
supplier
australia
with
nearly
million
tonnes
but
it
takes
six
weeks
for
a
cargo
to
travel
from
the
united
states
compared
with
several
weeks
for
indonesia
and
australia
costs
more
to
ship
and
coal
is
of
a
lower
quality
than
australian
coal
that
means
replacing
shipments
with
coal
from
other
places
may
not
be
difficult
sources
said
in
all
aspects
coal
does
not
have
any
advantages
said
zhang
min
coal
analyst
at
china
sublime
information
group
according
to
our
calculation
after
the
tariff
coal
will
cost
at
least
per
tonne
more
which
basically
rules
