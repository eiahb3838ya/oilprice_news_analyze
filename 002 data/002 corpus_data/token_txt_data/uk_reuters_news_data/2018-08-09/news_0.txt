australia
s
states
are
set
to
vote
on
friday
on
a
policy
to
end
more
than
a
decade
of
climate
and
energy
wars
and
spur
investment
in
new
power
supply
but
the
plan
may
be
killed
by
states
that
want
tougher
emissions
targets
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
is
pushing
the
national
energy
guarantee
neg
in
a
desperate
bid
to
bring
down
electricity
prices
which
have
more
than
doubled
over
the
past
decade
and
ensure
the
lights
stay
on
following
a
string
of
blackouts
in
and
the
national
energy
guarantee
is
a
historic
reform
it
should
be
supported
in
the
national
interest
it
will
deliver
lower
prices
cleaner
energy
and
a
much
more
reliable
energy
system
energy
minister
josh
frydenberg
said
under
the
neg
power
retailers
led
by
origin
energy
agl
energy
and
energy
australia
would
be
required
to
meet
reliability
and
emissions
targets
the
aim
is
to
ensure
there
is
enough
dispatchable
energy
power
that
can
back
up
intermittent
wind
and
solar
power
and
cut
carbon
emissions
from
the
sector
by
percent
from
levels
in
line
with
australia
s
paris
climate
accord
target
modelling
showed
the
national
energy
guarantee
would
bring
down
wholesale
power
prices
by
more
than
percent
from
where
they
would
be
without
the
policy
the
framework
has
won
broad
support
from
power
producers
clamouring
for
clarity
on
carbon
policy
to
support
new
power
plant
investments
as
well
as
from
businesses
farmers
and
consumer
groups
battling
high
and
volatile
electricity
prices
it
s
not
perfect
but
what
it
does
do
is
present
australia
and
investors
with
certainty
i
sincerely
hope
that
reason
prevails
on
friday
and
we
get
an
agreement
on
the
neg
nigel
garrard
managing
director
of
packaging
manufacturer
orora
ltd
told
reporters
on
thursday
the
framework
was
designed
by
independent
experts
on
the
energy
security
board
to
be
and
not
involve
setting
any
price
on
carbon
emissions
in
order
to
secure
support
from
the
coalition
government
s
right
wing
negotiated
over
nearly
a
year
the
plan
needs
unanimous
assent
from
all
six
states
to
go
ahead
but
the
state
of
victoria
where
the
labor
government
faces
an
election
in
november
and
stands
to
lose
seats
to
the
greens
has
thrown
up
hurdles
which
will
be
tough
for
the
governing
coalition
to
overcome
victoria
wants
emissions
reduction
targets
that
can
only
be
strengthened
over
time
with
targets
to
be
reviewed
every
three
years
and
future
targets
to
be
set
by
regulation
rather
than
legislation
former
prime
minister
tony
abbott
and
nationals
members
in
turnbull
s
coalition
do
not
want
to
give
any
future
labor
government
the
power
to
easily
raise
emissions
reduction
targets
and
make
electricity
less
competitive
we
can
still
get
this
right
but
only
if
malcolm
turnbull
stares
down
the

his
party
