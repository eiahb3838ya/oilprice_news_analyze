developer
lincoln
clean
energy
lce
in
a
million
deal
aiming
to
gain
a
foothold
in
what
it
sees
as
a
key
growth
market
the
acquisition
is
the
latest
move
for
orsted
as
it
seeks
to
shed
its
fossil
fuel
business
and
become
an
entirely
green
energy
company
orsted
which
has
so
far
mainly
developed
offshore
wind
farms
in
europe
said
the
global
market
for
onshore
wind
power
is
expected
to
grow
significantly
in
coming
years
and
that
the
united
states
is
a
key
market
we
see
this
as
a
very
valuable
addition
to
building
a
platform
for
growth
in
the
market
across
technologies
chief
executive
henrik
poulsen
told
journalists
the
company
previously
known
as
dong
energy
said
in
february
it
was
looking
at
investments
in
energy
storage
solar
projects
and
onshore
wind
it
was
previously
involved
in
onshore
wind
but
sold
the
business
in
due
to
financial
challenges
orsted
shares
which
have
risen
percent
since
listing
in
copenhagen
in
june
were
trading
percent
higher
at
danish
crowns
by
gmt
the
company
is
courting
investors
interested
in
green
assets
which
have
received
a
boost
from
government
policies
last
year
it
sold
its
oil
and
gas
business
to
ineos
and
has
also
put
its
danish
power
distribution
business
up
for
sale
orsted
has
named
the
united
states
and
taiwan
as
its
two
key
growth
markets
outside
its
core
northern
european
region
while
it
has
won
the
right
to
develop
two
projects
with
a
combined
capacity
of
megawatt
in
taiwan
it
has
so
far
been
unsuccessful
in
winning
tenders
in
the
united
states
we
see
lincoln
adding
further
to
our
critical
mass
and
our
presence
in
the
united
states
poulsen
said
focused
on
wind
and

orsted
also
posted
core
profit
ebitda
of

an

seen
in
a
reuters

it
said
it
expected
ebitda
towards
the
upper
end
of
its
previously
guided
range
of
between
billion
crowns
and
billion
orsted
also
said
it
was
likely
to
sell
percent
of
its
hornsea
