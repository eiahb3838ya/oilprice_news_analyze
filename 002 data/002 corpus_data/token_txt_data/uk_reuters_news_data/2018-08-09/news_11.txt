after soybeans, eu touts u.s. lng imports to woo trump on trade
brussels
reuters
the
european
union
said
it
was
delivering
on
a
deal
with
president
donald
trump
to
buy
more
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
on
thursday
but
called
on
washington
to
do
more
to
make
its
prices
competitive
in
talks
to
urge
trump
to
drop
hefty
new
tariffs
last
month
the
eu
s
chief
executive
juncker
agreed
to
work
to
increase
imports
of
soybeans
and
lng
to
the
bloc
the
eu
has
long
worked
to
diversify
away
from
relying
on
russia
for
almost
percent
of
its
gas
needs
by
developing
lng
infrastructure
to
access
other
suppliers
like
the
united
states
whether
lng
imports
can
win
market
share
away
from
russia
however
will
depend
on
market
forces
eu
officials
are
quick
to
stress
the
growing
exports
of
liquefied
natural
gas
if
priced
competitively
could
play
an
increasing
and
strategic
role
in
eu
gas
supply
juncker
said
in
a
statement
but
the
needs
to
play
its
role
in
doing
away
with
red
tape
restrictions
he
said
referring
to
rules
that
require
regulatory
approval
for
lng
exports
to
europe
since
the
arrival
of
the
first
lng
supplies
in
cumulative
imports
to
the
bloc
have
reached
billion
cubic
metres
the
eu
said
on
thursday
in
europe
accounted
for
more
than
percent
of
total
lng
exports
up
from
percent
in
it
said
spain
france
and
italy
are
the
largest
of
nine
eu
member
states
purchasing
gas
the
eu
s
decision
to
publish
historic
trade
data
is
unusual
part
of
the
bloc
s
drive
to
sway
trump
by
showing
trade
flows
can
benefit
the
united
states
earlier
this
month
the
european
commission
published
data
showing
a
surge
in
soybean
imports
so
far
this
year
as
buyers
responded
to
plunging
prices
after
china
largely
stopped
buying
soybeans
in
a
trade
row
both
sides
have
much
to
gain
by
working
together
juncker
added
trump
said
in
a
tweet
last
month
that
the
eu
would
be
buying
vast
amounts
of
lng
while
juncker
said
the
eu
would
build
more
terminals
to
handle
american
lng
however
of
europe
s
existing
import
facilities
lie
empty
while
demand
for
lng
on
the
continent
remains
limited
the
most
lucrative
markets
for
lng
are
in
south
and
central
america
india
and
the
far
east
with
europe
near
the
bottom
of
the
pile
given
its
relatively
low
prices
and
ample
supplies
of
gas
via
pipelines
from
russia
and
norway
