when
two
university
students
knocked
on
the
door
of
lillian
kanari
s
organic
food
shop
five
years
ago
seeking
work
she
realised
their
web
design
skills
could
help
her
business
solve
one
of
its
most
intractable
problems
food
waste
until
then
most
orders
were
placed
over
the
phone
and
that
resulted
in
some
customers
complaining
that
what
had
been
delivered
to
their
homes
was
not
what
they
had
ordered
it
cost
us
a
lot
in
terms
of
losses
and
food
nowadays
knowing
exactly
what
customers
want
allows
her
three
farms
to
operate
more
efficiently
and
that
cuts
waste
she
said
home
deliveries
have
helped
us
know
our
customers
consumption
patterns
we
have
a
planting
and
harvesting
calendar
right
from
the
farm
to
enable
us
to
plan
what
we
need
for
the
coming
season
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
having
a
website
also
means
more
business

said
her
kalimoni

shop
delivers
orders

up
from
a
week
previously
kanari
is
one
of
about
kenyan
farmers
who
have
gone
online
in
recent
years
to
sell
directly
to
the
public
as
opposed
to
selling
to
intermediaries
like
market
vendors
in
a
bid
to
boost
sales
and
reduce
food
waste
according
to
the
kenya
national
farmers
federation
kenaff
doing
so
could
generate
significant
sums
for
the
farmers
given
that
agriculture
contributes
about
a
quarter
of
kenya
s
billion
gdp
said
kenaff
head
mwenda
m
mailutha
most
of
these
are
smallholder
farmers
who
rely
on
agriculture
for
food
and
income
technology
can
help
them
in
marketing
and
avoid
middlemen
who
buy
their
produce
at
low
prices
he
said
smallscale
farmer
sylvia
kuria
s
farm
in
limuru
lies
about
kilometres
miles
northwest
of
nairobi
and
before
she
set
up
her
online
shop
she
could
sell
only
to
market
traders
that
meant
narrow
profit
margins
and
regular
haggling
for
each
order
it
also
meant
some
vegetables
from
her
farm
would
spoil
either
en
route
to
the
market
or
while
at
the
market
spoilage
is
a
global
problem
the
s
food
agriculture
organization
says
with
about
of
the
world
s
food
wasted
in
kenya
a
lack
of
proper
storage
facilities
and
at
markets
means
percent
of
food
is
wasted
before
it
can
be
eaten
said
jerome
ochieng
principal
secretary
at
the
ministry
of
information
communication
and
technology
the
government
wants
farmers
to
lower
that
number
and
technology
can
help
he
said
with
smart
government
initiatives
that
take
transactions
online
for
instance
able
to
cut
costs
eliminate
corruption
and
increase
efficiency
and
effectiveness
he
said
more
farmers
should
make
use
of
digital
solutions
the
agriculture
sector
in
kenya
is
expanding
at
a
rate
of
five
percent
every
year
ochieng
told
a
digital
farmers
conference
in
may
farmers
need
to
be
part
of
this
digital
revolution
so
that
they
can
play
a
role
in
ensuring
there
is
no
food
waste
from
the
agriculture
sector
he
said
to
that
end
ochieng
said
the
government
last
year
launched
its
big
four
agenda
a
plan
to
boost
economic
growth
by
focusing
on
food
security
as
well
as
on
affordable
housing
manufacturing
and
affordable
health
care
but
when
it
comes
to
cutting
wastage
he
said
rural
roads
remain
a
challenge
although
kenya
s
road
network
has
improved
those
in
rural
areas
are
not
yet
well
developed
which
means
produce
gets
damaged
in
transit
kanari
said
one
solution
is
to
open
a
shop
in
a
central
area
like
nairobi
where
farmers
can
store
and
distribute
their
produce
another
she
added
is
to
partner
with
established
food
distributors
to
help
farmers
get
their
produce
to
such
shops
when
it
comes
to
home
delivery
she
said
using
motorbikes
rather
than
trucks
gives
her
store
an
environmental
edge
motorbikes
are
faster
efficient
and
will
not
get
stuck
in
traffic
jams
where
most
emissions
occur
she
said
paul
kukubo
a
director
at
the
communications
authority
of
kenya
said
online
shopping
not
only
cuts
food
waste
attributable
to
losses
it
also
means
fewer
miles
travelled
by
producers
and
consumers
to
and
from
markets
this
reduces
the
amount
of
carbon
emissions
that
vehicles
would
have
released
to
the
atmosphere
for
that
day
he
said
this
is
important
especially
at
this
time
when
kenya
is
struggling
with
increased
air
pollution
in
its
kanari
said
small
retailers
like
her
could
do
more
for
the
environment
by
looking
at
packaging
too
in
her
case
she
works
with
a
group
of
women
in
central
kenya
who
supply
about
woven
baskets
a
month
once
used
for
deliveries
the
baskets
are
taken
back
to
the
shop
then
swapped
with
fresh
ones
once
the
baskets
get
old
they
can
be
used
at
the
farms
for
other
tasks
like
harvesting
produce
from
there
this
helps
reduce
the
amount
of
waste
being
dumped
in
the
environment
