improperly
tested
vehicles
for
fuel
economy
and
emissions
the
japanese
government
said
on
thursday
revealing
fresh
cases
of
compliance
failures
by
manufacturers
the
results
came
to
light
after
the
government
had
ordered
the
automakers
to
check
their
operations
after
revelations
of
improper
testing
at
subaru
corp
and
nissan
motor
co
last
year
the
conduct
of
automakers
globally

come
under

scrutiny

s
volkswagen
ag
admitted

the
japanese
cases
the
carmakers
have
not
broken
any
laws
or
prompted
massive
recalls

manufacturing
industry
for

efficiency

yamaha
cleared
vehicles

emissions
or
fuel
efficiency
even
in
cases
where
they
were
tested
under
invalid
conditions

ministry
said
in
a
statement
the
errors
related
to
slight
deviations
in
the
speed
of
the
vehicles
during
testing
that
should
have
invalidated
the
test
results
the
automakers
examined
tests
they
had
conducted
over
different
periods
of
time
and
in
suzuki
s
case
they
stretched
back
to
none
of
the
automakers
found
significant
problems
with
actual
emissions
and
fuel
economy
performance
of
the
vehicles
which
were
destined
for
sale
in
japan
and
do
not
plan
any
recalls

japan
s
automaker
said
that
of
sample
vehicles
tested

fuel
economy
and
emissions
since
