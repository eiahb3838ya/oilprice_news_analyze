aug

talks
on
completing
a
code
of
conduct
for
the
disputed
south
china
sea
will
be
long
and
complex
and
it
would
be
unrealistic
to
set
a
timetable
state
media
on
thursday
cited
a
senior
chinese
diplomat
as
saying
southeast
asia
and
china
agreed
last
week
on
a
working
text
to
continue
long
negotiations
over
the
code
of
conduct
with
officials
lauding
it
as
a
milestone
and
great
progress
several
members
of
the
association
of
southeast
asian
nations
asean
and
china
have
overlapping
claims
to
the
sea
one
of
the
world
s
busiest
and
most
strategic
waterways
where
china
has
expanded
reefs
into
manmade
islands
for
years
they
have
been
discussing
a
pact
to
prevent
an
escalation
of
disputes
in
an
interview
with
china
newsweek
magazine
yi
xianliang
director
general
of
the
chinese
foreign
ministry
s
department
of
boundary
and
ocean
affairs
said
the
talks
were
continuing
many
of
the
topics
were
complex
and
sensitive
and
there
were
many
different
points
of
view
he
said
if
these
issues
are
to
be
resolved
and
the
code
finally
comes
together
all
sides
need
to
keep
looking
for
the
greatest
common
denominator
yi
added
there
are
voices
from
the
outside
who
are
trying
to
set
a
timetable
for
the
talks
on
the
code
i
think
this
is
unrealistic
he
said
any
multilateral
talks
take
time
especially
on
such
a
complex
issue
as
the
south
china
sea
yi
added
it
is
impossible
to
define
a
timetable
instead
of
setting
the
timetable
unrealistically
and
binding
one
s
hands
it
s
better
to
step
forward
one
foot
at
a
china
has
repeatedly
denounced
what
it
views
as
interference
from
countries
outside
the
region
in
the
south
china
sea
generally
a
message
to
the
united
states
and
its
allies
to
stay
out
of
the
dispute
signing
china
up
to
a
legally
binding
and
enforceable
code
for
the
waterway
has
long
been
a
goal
for
claimant
members
of
asean
some
of
whom
have
sparred
for
years
over
what
they
see
as
china
s
disregard
for
their
sovereign
rights
and
its
blocking
of
fishermen
and
energy
exploration
efforts
yi
said
that
matter
was
complex
certain
countries
outside
the
region
have
been
agitating
that
the
code
must
be
legally
binding
this
issue
is
quite
complicated
including
the
domestic
legal
procedures
involved
in
the
countries
concerned
