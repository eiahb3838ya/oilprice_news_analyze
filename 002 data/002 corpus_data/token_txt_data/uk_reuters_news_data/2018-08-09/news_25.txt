new
sanctions
drove
down
russia
s
ruble
while
worries
that
turkey
was
sliding
into
a
economic

battered
the

on

while

these
events

higher
the
russian
ruble
slid
percent
after
washington
said
it
would
impose
fresh
sanctions
because
it
had
determined
that
moscow
had
used
a
nerve
agent
against
a
former
russian
agent
and
his
daughter
in
britain
which
the
kremlin
denies
the
ruble
slid
to
its
lowest
since
late

rubles
