the
shift
in
oil
market
power
away
from
opec
towards
a
bilateral
relationship
between
saudi
arabia
and
russia
is
the
culmination
of
structural
changes
in
oil
production
over
the
last
years
these
shifts
are
deeply
structural
and
have
little
to
do
with
the
personality
or
negotiating
skills
of
individual
oil
ministers
which
arguably
attract
far
too
much
attention
from
commentators
and
journalists
most
of
these
changes
can
be
traced
back
for
years
or
more
though
some
of
them
have
recently
accelerated
such
as
the
recent
slump
in
output
from
venezuela
and
libya
to
the
extent
that
production
is
an
important
component
of
market
power
the
very
different
fortunes
of
opec
countries
have
significantly
redistributed
power
within
the
organisation
the
result
is
that
the
focus
of
has
shifted
from
negotiations
to
negotiations

competition
opec
was
founded
in
to
reduce
harmful
competition
over
taxes
royalties
and
oil
ownership
between
its
original
members
as
they
tried
to
attract
investment
from
the
international
oil
companies
the
principal
aim
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
shall
be
the
coordination
and
unification
of
the
petroleum
policies
of
member
countries
according
to
opec
s
founding
statute
the
five
founding
members
saudi
arabia
iran
iraq
kuwait
and
venezuela
accounted
for
a
significant
share
of
the
world
s
undeveloped
oil
reserves
and
were
among
the
producers
opec
s
initial
focus
was
on
creating
a
united
front
in
negotiations
with
the
international
oil
companies
to
secure
a
greater
share
of
revenues
from
the
sale
of
oil
the
addition
of
libya
united
arab
emirates
algeria
and
nigeria
added
other
major
reserve
holders
and
rapidly
growing
producers
to
cement
opec
s
negotiating
power
opec
s
practical
focus
has
shifted
over
time
from
taxes
and
royalty
rates
to
equity
ownership
of
reserves
prices
onwards
and
production
allocations
onwards
the
organisation
s
market
power
arguably
peaked
in
when
members
accounted
for
just
over
half
of
all
oil
production
worldwide
before
sliding
to
around
a
quarter
in
and
partially
recovering
in
the
years
since
then
in
the
early
years
opec
was
dominated
by
an
internal
balance
of
power
between
saudi
arabia
iran
and
venezuela
with
other
countries
playing
a
more
peripheral
though
occasionally
disruptive
role
in
these
three
countries
were
producing
roughly
the
same
amount
about
million
barrels
per
day
each
statistical
review
of
world
energy
bp
by
saudi
arabia
had
already
pulled
significantly
ahead
million
bpd
of
both
iran
million
bpd
and
venezuela
million
bpd
a
gap
that
has
widened
in
the
subsequent
decades
opec
members
can
be
broadly
divided
into
winners
and
losers
since
based
on
whether
they
increased
output
by
the
biggest
winners
have
been
saudi
arabia
million
bpd
iraq
million
bpd
united
arab
emirates
million
bpd
angola
million
bpd
and
qatar
million
bpd
the
biggest
losers
have
been
libya
million
bpd
venezuela
million
bpd
and
iran
million
bpd
with
other
members
occupying
an
intermediate
position
the
winners
have
mostly
benefited
from
stable
government
significant
investment
some
of
it
foreign
and
technical
expertise
the
losers
have
been
hit
by
conflict
sanctions
unrest
corruption
and
mismanagement
some
countries
have
bounced
back
from
earlier
setbacks
notably
iraq
which
experienced
severe
production
losses
during
the
and
early
as
a
result
of
war
and
sanctions
some
have
suffered
more
recent
problems
such
as
libya
s
descent
into
tribal
conflict
from
which
they
may
recover
in
time
others
have
experienced
a
patchy
production
history
throughout
the
last
few
decades
such
as
venezuela
and
nigeria
which
has
recently
taken
a
sharp
turn
for
the
worse
in
the
case
of
venezuela
as
a
result
saudi
arabia
and
to
some
extent
the
united
arab
emirates
have
become
much
more
powerful
while
iran
and
venezuela
have
been
relegated
to
a
more
peripheral
status
moreover
saudi
arabia
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
are
the
only
members
with
significant
production
flexibility
and
contributed
most
of
the
voluntary
output
cuts
under
the
december
production
agreement
other
members
of
the
organisation
generally
produce
as
much
as
they
are
technically
able
because
their
immediate
revenue
needs
are
enormous
to
the
extent
countries
such
as
nigeria
libya
and
venezuela
have
cut
production
the
loss
of
output
has
been
forced
upon
them
by
unrest
and
mismanagement
negotiations
between
the
and
the
most
intense
negotiations
occurred
within
opec
as
members
tried
to
reach
a
common
position
among
themselves
and
only
then
negotiate
with
producers
outside
the
organisation
but
the
shifting
balance
of
production
and
power
has
made
negotiations
much
less
important
and
put
much
more
emphasis
on
negotiations
especially
with
a
resurgent
russia
sanctions
and
unrest
have
sidelined
iran
libya
venezuela
and
to
some
extent
nigeria
largely
relegating
them
to
bystanders
within
opec
negotiations
of
the
remaining
opec
members
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
have
coordinated
their
production
policies
closely
with
saudi
arabia
for
the
last
two
decades
the
changing
balance
of
power
has
left
saudi
arabia
as
the
undisputed
leader
of
opec
and
free
to
concentrate
on
negotiations
with
outside
countries
principally
russia
instead
of
negotiating
production
allocations
around
a
conference
table
at
opec
headquarters
in
vienna
which
was
the
focus
for
between
the
and
the
most
important
negotiations
are
now
bilateral
between
saudi
arabia
and
russia
the
shift
should
not
come
as
a
surprise
to
observers
of
opec
the
balance
of
power
and
the
content
of
negotiations
has
changed
repeatedly
in
the
last
six
decades
it
may
not
be
the
last
shift
if
iraq
s
production
continues
to
climb
it
will
become
harder
to
ignore
and
the
balance
of
power
will
shift
again
output
in
iran
venezuela
and
libya
could
eventually
recover
or
nigeria
could
return
to
growth
also
challenging
saudi
arabia
s
control
for
the
time
being
however
saudi
arabia
s
leadership
is
undisputed
and
the
negotiations
that
matter
are
with
russia
