would

that
trudeau
s
comments
were
positive
but
more
needed
to
be
done
there
is
no
doubt
that
the

talk

still
waiting
for
more
to
bridge

has
threatened
to
undermine

unsettled
by
a
series
of
assertive
political
and
diplomatic
initiatives
by
the
top

a

considerations
khalid
said

the
current
diplomatic
crisis
between
saudi
arabia

will
not
in

way
impact

cic

for
comment
from
a
mutual
funds

i
don
t
think
there
s
any
significant
investment
in
canada
from
saudi
arabia
said
a
banker
based
in
riyadh
the
footprint
is
light
and
very
small
compared
to
in
the
united
eurasia
group
said
easing
the
crisis
needed
time
it
added
in
a
note
the
new
saudi
leadership
is
leveraging
economic
and
political
tools
to
send
a
message
to
its
partners
that
intervention
in
its
domestic
affairs
will
not
be
foreign
minister
adel
on
wednesday
ruled
out
any
mediation
efforts
and
said
the
kingdom
was
considering
taking
more
measures
against
canada
for
interfering
in
saudi
arabia
s
domestic
affairs
he
did
not
elaborate
saudi
arabia
has
in
recent
months
detained
several
women
s
rights
activists
some
of
whom
had
campaigned
for
the
right
to
drive
and
an
end
to
the
kingdom
s
male
guardianship
system
the
latest
to
be
swept
up
in
a
government
crackdown
on
dissent
since
rising
to
power
in
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
has
courted
western
allies
to
support
his
reform
plans
to
modernize
and
open
up
the
kingdom
offering
billions
of
dollars
in
arms
sales
and
promising
to
fight
radicalism
in
the
kingdom
the
de
facto
ruler
has
launched
a
campaign
of
social
and
economic
change
but
has
not
eased
the
absolute
monarchy
s
total
ban
on
political
activism
he
has
taken
a
more
aggressive
stance
toward
iran
begun
a
war
in
yemen
and
led
a
boycott
of
fellow
gulf
arab
state
qatar
the
row
with
canada
is
a
sign
the
prince
is
willing
to
risk
riling
international
investors
in
order
to
stay
in
control
of
the
process
of
change
rbc

helima
croft
wrote
western
governments
expressing
concerns
about
human
rights
issues
in
the
kingdom
is
nothing
new
and
saudi
authorities
have
long
pushed
back
against
what
they
characterize
as
inappropriate
interference
in
their
internal
affairs
she
said
in
a
note
but
prince
mohammed
is
more
willing
than
predecessors
to
throw
caution
to
the
wind
she
added
and
may
be
extra
sensitive
to
outside
criticism
in
light
of
recent
challenges
implementing
his
ambitious
economic
reform
agenda
