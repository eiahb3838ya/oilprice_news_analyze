alarm
bells
were
ringing
on
thursday
as
new
sanctions
drove
down
russia
s
rouble
and
worries
that
turkey
was
sliding
towards
a
economic
crisis
battered
the
lira
a
rally
in
chinese
stocks
had
helped
offset
the
latest
escalation
in
the
trade
war
overnight
after
beijing
matched
the
latest
sanctions
but
too
much
was
going
on
nearby
for
europe
to
remain
unscathed
london
s
ftse
frankfurt
s
dax
and
paris
were
down
percent
percent
and
percent
respectively
while
german
government
bonds
rose
in
a
broad
grab
for
safety
wall
street
futures
pointed
to
a
steady
start
in
new
york
but
that
was
deceptive
the
main
fireworks
were
in
the
currency
markets
the
russian
rouble
sank
after
washington
said
it
would
impose
fresh
sanctions
because
it
had
determined
that
moscow
had
used
a
nerve
agent
against
a
former
russian
agent
and
his
daughter
in
britain
something
the
kremlin
denies
there
were
also
reports
of
a
new
senate
bill
that
if
passed
would
impose
even
more
widespread
punishments
for
meddling
in
elections
the
rouble
slid
to
its
lowest
since
late
hitting
roubles
to
the
dollar
and
leaving
it
almost
percent
lighter
than
it
had
been
hours
i
m
surprised
that
the
market
in
retrospect
was
quite
complacent
about
this
risk
said
north
asset
management
portfolio
manager
peter
kisler
though
he
was
relieved
the
new
sanctions
hadn
t
flagged
a
ban
on
russian
sovereign
debt
or
banks
for
the
time
being
turkey
s
lira
bond
and
stocks
markets
were
taking
even
more
of
a
pounding
after
meetings
between
officials
in
washington
looked
to
have
made
little
progress
in
mending
a
row
over
ankara
s
jailing
of
an
american
pastor
the
lira
touched
a
record
low
of
against
the
dollar
weakening
some
percent
from
wednesday
s
close
there
was
widespread
selling
in
the
country
s
bond
markets
and
istanbul
stocks
dropped
percent
too
we
think
turkey
may
need
to
approach
the
imf
or
seek
other
external
support
otherwise
measures
seem
to
be
a
distinct
possibility
said
fund
manager
lombard
odier
s
chief
investment
strategist
salman
ahmed
asia
had
been
much
brighter
shanghai
blue
chips
closed
up
percent
after
talk
of
possible
government
support
for
technology
companies
the
latest
in
a
series
of
measures
rolled
out
by
beijing
as
the
trade
dispute
worsens
hopes
for
more
chinese
infrastructure
spending
underpinned
industrial
resources
including
iron
ore
and
copper
the
gains
in
chinese
stocks
helped
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
reverse
early
losses
to
gain
percent
though
japan
s
nikkei
slipped
percent
in
part
because
core
machinery
orders
fell
shares
in
mazda
motor
corp
suzuki
motor
corp
and
yamaha
motor
co
also
fell
on
news
they
conducted
improper
fuel
economy
and
emissions
tests
on
their
vehicles
japan
will
try
to
avert
steep
tariffs
on
its
car
exports
and
fend
off
demands
for
a
agreement
at
talks
in
washington
later
early
on
thursday
china
s
state
broadcaster
said
the
country
must
counteract
tariffs
and
that
beijing
had
the
confidence
to
protect
its
own
interests
as
well
as
the
means
to
do
so
china
had
announced
additional
tariffs
of
percent
on
billion
worth
of
imports
from
fuel
to
autos
the
tariffs
will
apply
to
billions
of
dollars
in
gasoline
diesel
and
other
oil
products
though
not
crude
the
oil
market
took
the
news
hard
on
wednesday
suffering
losses
of
more
than
percent
prices
steadied
a
little
on
thursday
with
crude
edging
down
cents
to
per
barrel
and
brent
flat
at
back
in
the
fx
markets
it
wasn
t
only
currencies
that
were
struggling
the
pound
wallowed
at
its
lowest
against
the
dollar
and
euro
in
almost
a
year
as
fears
remained
that
britain
might
leave
the
european
union
without
a
deal
on
trade
traders
reported
a
significant
increase
in
investors
hedging
against
a
brexit
an
event
that
could
send
sterling
into
free
fall
and
hurt
the
economy
by
raising
trade
barriers
with
britain
s
biggest
export
market
sterling
was
last
trading
at
having
dropped
percent
overnight
the
japanese
yen
seemed
to
be
catching
a
bid
as
a
safe
haven
with
the
dollar
easing
to
yen
after
stretching
as
high
as
on
wednesday
the
euro
was
subdued
at
while
the
dollar
index
was
up
at
the
new
zealand
dollar
dropped
percent
to
a
low
at
after
the
country
s
central
bank
pledged
to
keep
rates
at
record
lows
well
into
the
risk
of
rate
moves
over
the
next
months
is
weighted
more
towards
cuts
than
hikes
and
financial
markets
will
price
the
risk
accordingly
said
kiwibank
s
chief
economist
jarrod
kerr
the
good
news
here
is
interest
rates
and
exchange
rates
will
remain
lower
for
much
longer
