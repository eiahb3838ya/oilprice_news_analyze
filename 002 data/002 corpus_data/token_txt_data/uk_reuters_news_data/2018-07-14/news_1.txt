hundreds

on

the

will
have
no

gas
output
the
norwegian
association
said
it
planned
no
contact
to
resolve
the
strike
before
the
deadline
and
was
considering
countermeasures
instead
a
middle
way
is
not
a
solution
our
position
is
unchanged
i
don
t
think
that
there
will
be
any
contact
during
the
weekend
the
association
chief
negotiator
jakob
korsgaard
told
reuters
the
safe
union
also
told
reuters
on
saturday
that
it
expected
no
contact

also
said
he
did
not
know
of
any
efforts
to
resolve
the
standoff
the
employers
who
say
workers
already
have
fair
wages
are
considering
countermeasures
if
the
strike
doesn
t
end
soon
obviously
a
conflict
like
this
can
not
go
on
for
ever
all
are
considered
said
korsgaard
without
giving
details
in
employers
threatened
to
shut
down
all
oil
and
gas
operations
in
norway
after
a
strike
choked
off
percent
of
the
country
s
output
in
that
strike
the
government
ordered
offshore
workers
back
to
work
to
avoid
a
total
shutdown
invoking
laws
that
allow
it
to
end
strikes
that
threaten
big
economic
damage
the
government
has
that
measure
if
they
find
it
relevant
