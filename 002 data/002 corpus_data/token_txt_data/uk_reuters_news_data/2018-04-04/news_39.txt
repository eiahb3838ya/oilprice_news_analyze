hit
a
high
of

on
the
culmination
of
a
gradual
but
relentless
tightening
of
the
supply
chain
that
had
been
playing
out
over
several
years
since
then
zinc
has
been
dragged
lower

analysts
such
as
max

believe
there
is
still
the
potential
for
one
last

higher

running

the

seems
to
agree
judging
by
the
concentration
of
bull
positioning
over
the
next
three
months
thereafter
open

drops
off
sharply
until

when
bearish
views
predominate
the

it
seems
is
for
zinc
s
bull
cycle
to
peak
sooner
rather
than
later
before

the
landscape
of
options
positioning
in
the
zinc
market
can
t
tell
us
where
the
price
is
going
but
it
does
give
a
fair
idea
of
where
the
market
thinks
the
price
might
be
going
and
in
the
short
term
the
market
still
seems
to
be
collectively
bullish
the
number
of
call
options
which
confer
the
right
to
buy
dwarfs
the
amount
of
put

which
confer
the
right
to

and

the

expire

but
as
of
last
night

close
there
were
lots
tonnes
of
call

open
interest
versus
just
lots
of
put

upside
skew
is
even
more
extreme
in

with

open

on
calls
versus
lots

the

market
positioning
is
clustered
on
three
main
strike
prices
namely
lots
lots
and
lots
the
very
highest
strike
price
open
is
with
lots
sitting
there
on
each
of
the
front
three
months
after
june
however
options
open
interest
falls
off
a
cliff
up
to
december
which
tends
to
be
a
liquid
month
for
options
positioning
in
any
given
year
and
although
there
are
lots
of
wildly
optimistic
call
options
open
on
the
strike
in
december
upside
interest
is
eclipsed
by
downside
put
option
positioning
the
market
in
other
words
appears
to
agree
with
the
view
of
citi
s
layton
and
other
analysts
if
there
s
going
to
be
one
last
bull
hurrah
it
s
going
to
happen
by
july
after
which
options
open
interest
and
bull
exuberance
both
plummet
this
narrative
of
one
last
price
peak
is
predicated
on
a
building
supply
response
to
recent
high
prices
the
international
lead
and
zinc
study
group
ilzsg
expects
some
tonnes
of
additional
mine
supply
to
enter
the
market
this
year
according
to
joao
jorge
the
group
s
director
of
market
research
speaking
at
the
same
london
conference
the
ilzsg
is
forecasting
mine
production
growth
to
accelerate
from
percent
in
to
percent
this
year
the
mine
surge
will
result
from
a
combination
of
restarts
such
as
that
announced
by
glencore
last
december
and
new
mines
such
as
vedanta
s
gamsberg
project
in
south
africa
the
single
biggest
addition
to
global
supply
however
will
come
from
the
century
zinc
mine
in
australia
century
closed
in
but
new
century
resources
aims
to
produce
zinc
concentrates
from
the
old
tailings
at
the
mine
site
the
company
is
guiding
towards
a
restart
of
activity
in
the
third
quarter
of
this
year
with
a
to
full
capacity
of
tonnes
per
year
of
contained
metal
that
s
around
half
of
what
century
was
capable
of
producing
in
its
heyday
century
it
s
worth
remembering
repeatedly
dashed
bulls
hopes
in
the
long
to
this
year
s
high
prices
by
staying
open
much
longer
than
expected
the
very
fact
it
is
coming
back
at
all
is
astonishing
but
will
new
century
like
old
century
spring
more
surprises
on
the
unwary
this
time
by
taking
longer
to
ramp
up
than
expected
if
you
re
looking
to
the
concentrates
part
of
the
market
for
an
answer
you
re
in
for
a
disappointment
this
year
s
benchmark
treatment
charges
for
the
processing
of
concentrates
into
metal
should
provide
some
insight
into
the
state
of
play
in
the
raw
materials
segment
of
the
supply
chain
but
after
two
fruitless
rounds
of
meetings
smelters
and
miners
are
still
far
apart
on
how
much
new
supply
to
expect
and
how
quickly
to
expect
it
uncertainty
around
these
changing
supply
dynamics
this
year
is
going
to
remain
a
key
unknown
for
many
months
a
more
immediate
threat
to
the
zinc
consensus
might
come
from
visible
stocks
lme
inventory
has
fallen
from
almost
tonnes
in
to
a
current
tonnes
just
about
all
of
it
in
the
port
of
new
orleans
the
occasional
arrival
of
more
zinc
in
lme
warehouses
in
the
city
such
as
the
tonnes
that
were
warranted
in
a
single
day
on
march
has
unsettled
the
market
there
s
nothing
new
to
this
new
orleans
zinc
roundabout
but
with
visible
stocks
so
low
what
s
happening
to
invisible
stocks
sitting
in
storage
takes
on
added
significance
quite
evidently
if
more
zinc
miraculously
turns
up
in
the
big
easy
it
puts
at
risk
the
potential
for
that
bull
charge
to
new
highs
there
again
with
only
tonnes
of
lme
stocks
available
the
london
price
is
going
to
remain
highly
sensitive
to
further
cancellations
and
drawdowns
maybe
that
s
what
the
bull
with
the
december
calls
on
the
strike
price
is
hoping
for
else
