the
palestinians
are
seeking
to
sell
a
percent
stake
in
a
gas
field
off
gaza
to
help
to
develop
the
project
its
main
stakeholder
the
palestine
investment
fund
said
on
wednesday
after
royal
dutch
shell
announced
it
had
pulled
out
gaza
marine
about
km
miles
off
the
gaza
coast
has
long
been
seen
as
an
opportunity
for
the
palestinian
authority
to
join
the
mediterranean
gas
bonanza
providing
a
major
source
of
income
to
reduce
its
reliance
on
foreign
aid
but
palestinian
political
disputes
and
conflict
with
israel
as
well
as
economic
factors
have
delayed
plans
to
develop
the
field
and
shell
had
struggled
to
find
a
buyer
for
its
percent
stake
in
the
field
which
it
took
over
as
part
of
its
acquisition
of
bg
group
in
shell
said
on
wednesday
it
had
reached
an
agreement
with
the
palestine
investment
fund
pif
to
divest
its
interest
in
gaza
marine
the
pif
a
sovereign
wealth
fund
said
that
under
a
new
structure
agreed
with
the
palestinian
authority
the
pif
and
its
investment
partner
cc
oil
and
gas
ltd
would
each
hold
percent
of
development
rights
and
a
future
foreign
operator
would
have
percent
the
pif
said
the
new
structure
would
give
momentum
to
one
of
palestine
s
most
vital
strategic
assets
fuel
power
plants
in
gaza
and
the
city
of
jenin
in
the
west
bank
and
enable
the
palestinians
to
become
an
energy
exporter
gaza
marine
is
estimated
to
hold
over
trillion
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas
the
equivalent
of
spain
s
consumption
in
but
plans
to
develop
it
were
put
off
several
times
over
the
past
decade
discovered
at
the
end
of
the
century
it
lies
between
two
rapidly
expanding
gas
hubs
in
egypt
and
israel
both
of
which
have
attracted
huge
investments
in
recent
years
attempts
to
develop
the
field
were
put
on
hold
repeatedly
after
hamas
which
western
countries
and
israel
have
designated
as
a
terrorist
group
took
control
over
the
gaza
strip
in
israel
then
put
an
economic
blockade
on
gaza
raising
questions
about
the
financing
of
the
project
and
the
sharing
of
future
profits
among
the
palestinians
israel
has
however
said
in
the
past
it
supports
the
field
s
development
