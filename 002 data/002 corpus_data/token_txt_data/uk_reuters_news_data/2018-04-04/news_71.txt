reuters
anglo
american
plc
said
on
tuesday
it
would
halt
production
and
transport
of
iron
ore
for
days
from
its
mine
in
brazil
to
inspect
a
pipeline
that
has
leaked
twice
complying
with
authorities
demands
for
the
review
anglo
froze
operations
at
the
mine
in
minas
gerias
state
after
the
leak
was
discovered
on
march
in
a
pipeline
which
carries
iron
ore
in
slurry
to
an
export
terminal
in
coastal
rio
de
janeiro
the
incident
came
just
weeks
after
another
leak
in
a
different
section
of
the
same
pipeline
prompted
anglo
to
suspend
operations
at
the
mine
from
march
raising
fresh
questions
about
mining
oversight
in
brazil
ruben
fernandes
anglo
s
chief
in
brazil
said
the
company
estimated
the
total
cost
of
repair
including
environmental
and
social
costs
to
be
about
million
reais
million
excluding
lost
revenue
from
exports
obviously
the
loss
of
revenue
will
be
more
than
that
because
we
will
stop
shipments
for
the
next
few
months
he
said
at
an
event
in
sao
paulo
without
offering
a
figure
fernandes
said
anglo
was
already
negotiating
with
customers
to
reschedule
shipments
since
iron
ore
stocks
were
running
low
environmental
regulator
ibama
mandated
that
the
company
inspect
the
pipeline
which
the
company
said
should
take
about
days
anglo
said
the
leak
of
iron
ore
slurry
was
stopped
within
eight
minutes
and
caused
no
disruption
to
local
water
supply
and
no
injuries
