healthy
demand
for
molybdenum
rich
stainless
steel
especially
from
the
oil
and
gas
industry
plus
sluggish
supply
growth
are
expected
to
keep
the
price
of
this
minor
metal
riding
high
molybdenum
prices
at
nearly
a
lb
are
at
their
highest
since
having
more
than
doubled
since
often
a
byproduct
of
copper
smelting
molybdenum
s
powerful
properties
are
vital
for
equipment
used
in
the
oil
and

sectors
a
rally
in
crude

prices
to
around
a

molybdenum
is
used
in
exploration
drilling
production
and
refining
said
cru
group
consultant
george
heppel
adding
that
high
prices
were
needed
to
encourage
primary
production
from
top
producer
china
the
trend
over
the
next
years
is
one
of
very
low
supply
growth
from
sources
in
the
we
will
need
to
see
primary
mines
reopened
to
keep
the
market
analysts
estimate
around
percent
of
global
molybdenum
supply
comes
as
a
byproduct
of
copper
smelting
with
most
of
the
remainder
coming
from
primary
sources
cru
forecasts
molybdenum
demand
at
million
lbs
this
year
of
which
percent
will
come
from
oil
and
gas
that
is
below
the
historic
average
of
percent
but
still
a
notable
increase
over
recent
years
the
oil
price
crash
back
in
removed
about
million
lbs
of
moly
demand
heppel
said
demand
now
looks
crude
s
slide
started
in
when
saudi
arabia
turned
on
the
oil
taps
to
defend
market
share
while
molybdenum
prices
crashed
to
below
a
lb
between
august
and
november
wood
mackenzie
expects
global
oil
and
gas
exploration
spending
to
fall
this
year
but
this
slide
masks
a
modest
uptick
in
drilling
activity
as
lower
rig
rates
and
a
focused
approach
on
basins
allow
firms
to
do
more
with
their
money
the
consultancy
sees
onshore
producers
focusing
primarily
on
shale
gas
ramping
up
annual
activity
from
billion
in
to
billion
in
we
re
seeing
a
pick
up
in
tubular
goods
used
in
the
north
american
shale
gas
market
said
david
merriman
a
senior
analyst
at
metals
consultancy
roskill
there
s
a
strong
correlation
between
moly
demand
and
active
drill
molybdenum
is
also
used
to
make
superalloys
for
aerospace
and
lighter
higher
strength
steels
for
cars
demand
in
both
industries
is
also
picking
up
there
isn
t
really
a
shortage
at
the
moment
but
supply
could
become
a
problem
a
molybdenum
trader
said
top
producers
include
chile
where
codelco
s
tonnes
of
moly
output
last
year
compares
with
tonnes
in
the
lower
production
is
due
to
the
lower
molybdenum
grade
in
its
chuquicamata
mine
a
codelco
spokesperson
said
the
sierra
gorda
mine
in
chile
in
which
polish
copper
miner
kghm
has
a
percent
stake
produced
nearly
million
pounds
in
a
kghm
spokesperson
said
output
this
year
will
be
percent
lower
because
of
lower
ore
grades
in
china
it
s
to
do
with
cutting
pollution
but
with
prices
where
they
are
chinese
producers
may
rethink
shutdowns
the
molybdenum
trader
said
higher
prices
could
also
incentivise
the
restart
of
the
thomson
creek
mine
in
idaho
owned
by
centerra
which
also
has
a
majority
stake
in
endako
in
british
columbia
these
two
mines
produced
more
than
million
lbs
of
moly
in
since
which
time
both
have
been
on
care
maintenance
there
are
no
plans
to
restart
the
mines
at
this
point
in
time
a
spokesperson
for
centerra
said
but
we
are
updating
our
restart
plans
to
see
how
long
it
would
take
how
much
it
would
cost
what
personnel
we
would
need
