opec
oil
output
fell
in
march
to
an
low
due
to
declining
angolan
exports
libyan
outages
and
a
further
slide
in
venezuelan
output
a
reuters
survey
found
sending
compliance
with
a
deal
to
another
record
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
pumped
million
barrels
per
day
last
month
the
survey
found
down
bpd
from
february
the
march
total
is
the
lowest
since
april
according
to
reuters
surveys
opec
is
reducing
output
by
about
million
bpd
as
part
of
a
deal
with
russia
and
other
producers
to
get
rid
of
excess
supply
the
pact
started
in
january
and
runs
until
the
end
of
adherence
by
producers
in
the
deal
rose
to
percent
of
agreed
cuts
from
percent
in
february
the
survey
found
there
was
no
sign
that
other
producers
had
boosted
output
to
cash
in
on
higher
prices
or
to
compensate
for
the
venezuelan
decline
oil
has
topped
a
barrel
this
year
for
the
first
time
since
and
was
trading
above
on
wednesday
still
opec
says
supply
restraints
should
be
maintained
to
ensure
the
end
of
a
glut
that
had
built
up
since
in
march
the
biggest
decrease
in
supply
came
from
angola
which
exported
cargoes
two
fewer
than
in
the
same
month
of
natural
declines
at
some
fields
are
weighing
on
output
production
in
libya
which
remains
unstable
due
to
unrest
slipped
because
of
stoppages
at
two
fields
el
feel
and
el
sharara
setting
back
s
partial
recovery
in
output
and
production
fell
further
in
venezuela
where
the
oil
industry
is
starved
of
funds
because
of
an
economic
crisis
output
dropped
to
million
bpd
in
march
the
survey
found
a
new
low
output
in
opec
s
largest
producer
saudi
arabia
dropped
by
bpd
from
february
s
revised
level
even
further
below
the
kingdom
s
target
opec
s
no
producer
iraq
pumped
more
exports
from
the
south
the
outlet
for
most
of
the
country
s
crude
rose
despite
maintenance
at
a
loading
terminal
exports
declined
from
the
north
but
domestic
crude
use
increased
among
others
with
higher
output
the
biggest
rise
came
from
the
united
arab
emirates
where
production
had
dropped
in
february
due
to
maintenance
even
so
the
uae
is
still
pumping
below
its
opec
target
and
showing
higher
compliance
than
in
output
climbed
in
qatar
after
a
dip
in
february
that
sources
attributed
to
maintenance
nigeria
also
pumped
at
a
higher
level
extending
a
run
of
more
stable
supply
from
africa
s
top
exporter
nigeria
and
libya
were
originally
exempt
from
cutting
supply
because
their
output
had
been
curbed
by
conflict
and
unrest
for
both
told
opec
that
output
would
not
exceed
levels
opec
has
an
implied
production
target
for
of
million
bpd
based
on
cutbacks
detailed
in
late
and
taking
into
account
changes
of
membership
since
plus
nigeria
and
libya
s
expectations
of
output
according
to
the
survey
opec
pumped
about
bpd
below
this
implied
target
in
march
not
least
because
of
the
involuntary
decline
in
venezuela
