the
dollar
weakened
and
global
stock
markets
fell
on
wednesday
after
china
retaliated
in
an
escalating
trade
war
with
the
united
states
unnerving
investors
who
were
reluctant
to
take
positions
in
anything
but
the
safest
of
assets
oil
dropped
to
a
low
as
the
speed
with
which
beijing
responded
hours
to
measures
raised
the
prospect
of
a
quickly
spiraling
trade
war
that
could
hurt
the
global
economy
and
dent
crude
demand
gold
hit
a
high
as
the
dollar
dipped
against
the
yen
and

while
prices
of
treasury

and
german
bunds
gained
on
buying
boeing

led
a
slide
in
big
manufacturers
and
technology
companies
that
bore
the
brunt
of
the
deepening
trade
spat
while
germany
s
dax
index
fell
more
than
its
large
european
counterparts
but
stocks
on
wall
street
and
in
europe
pulled
back
from
more
than
percent
declines
paring
a
chunk
of
their
losses
with

the
market
is
overreacting
to
this
trade
news

these
tariffs
won
t
be
implemented
for
a
little
while
it
gives
both
sides
time
to
negotiate
which
i
think
is
the
strategy
for
both
the
and
china
s
retaliation
came
after
trading
hours
for

china
and
the

are
likely
to
hold
prolonged
negotiations
on
trade

strong

the

arone
said
my
view
is
this
is
more
trade
poker
than
it
is
trade
policy
