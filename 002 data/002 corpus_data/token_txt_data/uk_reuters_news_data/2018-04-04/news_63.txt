analysis-oil giants stay in their own backyards in u.s. auction
new
york
reuters
the
trump
administration
heralded
the
government
s
sale
last
month
of
drilling
leases
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
as
a
bellwether
if
that
is
the
case
a
reuters
analysis
of
the
sale
s
results
shows
reason
to
worry
about
demand
in
future
offshore
auctions
the
sale
brought
in
million
as
just
percent
of
the
million
acres
million
hectares
offered
found
bidders
reuters
examined
the
acreage
offered
and
leased
and
nearly
all
the
purchases
show
big
drillers
stuck
closest
to
existing
infrastructure
shunning
the
most
areas
while
crude
oil
production
reached
a
record
last
year
at
more
than
million
barrels
a
day
most
new
development
is
in
onshore
shale
regions
the
interior
department
has
said
it
wants
to
open
all
coasts
for
drilling
including
the
atlantic
and
pacific
but
the
gulf
result
indicates
limited
interest
even
in
areas
never
mind
unexplored
coasts
the
march
auction
included
deepwater
blocks
each
comprising
roughly
nine
square
miles
only
of
these
blocks
received
bids
and
all
but
three
of
these
were
close
to
existing
infrastructure
and
leases
it
kind
of
looks
like
they
re
just
shoring
up
their
existing
prospects
right
now
said
john
filostrat
a
spokesman
for
the
bureau
of
ocean
energy
management
the
division
of
interior
that
manages
the
auctions
filostrat
said
the
administration
is
still
optimistic
about
future
auctions
and
believes
more
auctions
are
needed
to
show
the
current
trends

however
money
for
exploration
is
increasingly
flocking
to
other
regions
particularly
latin
america
where
energy
reforms
have
attracted
billions
of
dollars
in
investment
from
companies
historically
known
as
gulf
heavyweights
a
january
auction
by
mexico
brought
in
more
than
four
times
the
bids
as
the
sale
of
the
new
leases
in
water
depths
of
more
than
feet
meters
were
immediately
contiguous
with
existing
leased
acreage
or
production
platforms
and
another
were
within
about
two
miles
of
existing
leases
or
infrastructure
according
to
the
reuters
analysis
among
the
areas
where
companies
submitted
bids
were
mississippi
canyon
and
green
canyon
two
of
the
most
densely
leased
plays
in
the
gulf
about
miles
km
off
the
louisiana
coast
royal
dutch
shell
plc
was
the
high
bidder
on
two
mississippi
canyon
blocks
overall
shell
picked
up
gulf
blocks
including
adjacent
to
its
deepwater
developments
known
as
kakias
and
stones
and
clustered
around
other
actively
leased
areas
it
told
reuters
that
it
wanted
to
acquire
blocks
that
could
potentially
support
future
development
using
our
existing
bp
plc
s
most
notable
bids
were
blocks
in
desoto
canyon
contiguous
to
a
known
gas
field
about
miles
from
the
louisiana
coast
bp
is
strategic
with
its
bids
and
we
use
the
opportunity
to
expand
and
strengthen
our
plays
a
company
spokesman
told
reuters
only
three
blocks
leased
were
more
than
a
few
miles
from
existing
acreage
those
blocks
were
snapped
up
by
chevron
which
declined
comment
bidding
on
parcels
close
to
known
assets
increases
the
likelihood
of
finds
that
can
be
produced
affordably
cutting
infrastructure
and
supply
costs
there
s
still
interest
but
it
is
in
areas
where
there
was
already
existing
knowledge
of
the
resource
base
or
existing
development
activity
or
existing
production
said
michael
cohen
director
of
commodity
research
at
barclays
spending
a
lot
of
money
to
prospect
is
probably
not
going
to
be
looked
upon
with
favor
by
investors
he
said
major
oil
companies
remain
lukewarm
about
pushing
the
boundaries
of
available
frontiers
desiring
longer
leases
and
lower
royalty
rates
deepwater
offshore
blocks
currently
require
an
percent
payment
to
the
government
compared
with
percent
for
shallower
areas
and
onshore
drilling
an
interior
department
panel
in
february
recommended
lowering
those
rates
it
is
something
to
look
for
in
the
august
sale
possibly
said
boem
s
filostrat
companies
have
also
expressed
a
desire
for
longer
leases
to
more
effectively
drill
in
unexplored
areas
further
from
the
coasts
six
deepwater
regions
more
than
miles
off
the
louisiana
coast
received
no
bids
at
all
the
water
here
is
generally
about
two
miles
deep
the
locale
makes
both
drilling
and
transporting
oil
to
shore
especially
costly
the
high
cost
of
building
underwater
pipelines
is
another
deterrent
deepwater
projects
like
chevron
s
jack
and
malo
fields
more
than
miles
from
the
coast
required
a
pipeline
connecting
them
to
existing
gulf
infrastructure
closer
to
shore
approved
in
during
a
boom
when
crude
traded
at
about
a
barrel
oil
prices
have
rebounded
from
s
lows
at
less
than
a
barrel
but
the
industry
is
still
in
a
bit
of
a
wait
and
see
mode
