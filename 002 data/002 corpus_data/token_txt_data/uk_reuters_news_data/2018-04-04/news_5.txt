brazilian
jaguars
imperiled
by
hunters
ranchers
and
destruction
of
their
habitat
have
learned
to
survive
at
least
one
menace
flooding
in
the
amazon
they
take
to
the
trees
although
they
can
be
six
feet
long
and
pounds
the
largest
south
american
cats
nimbly
navigate
treetops
where
they
stay
from
april
to
july
when
the
rainforest
floor
is
under
water
it
shows
that
even
as
a
large
animal
the
jaguar
can
withstand
the
flooding
feeding
breeding
and
raising
its
young
in
the
treetops
for
three
to
four
months
says
emiliano
ramalho
the
lead
researcher
for
project
iauarete
which
is
administered
by
the
instituto
mamirauá
this
had
never
been
documented
before
we
began
researching
the
jaguars
the
iauaretê
project
monitors
jaguars
in
mamirauá
studies
their
relationship
with
local
residents
and
undertakes
conservation
for
the
species
which
lives
deep
in
the
rainforest
documenting
jaguar
behaviour
during
the
rainy
season
is
rare
with
their
stays
in
the
treetops
first
recorded
by
the
researchers
in
after
nine
years
of
monitoring
in
the
region
but
from
to
in
several
visits
to
the
mamirauá
sustainable
development
reserve
kilometres
miles
west
of
amazonas
state
capital
manaus
we
photographed
jaguars
perched
high
on
branches
called
painted
jaguars
in
brazil
because
of
their
intricately
spotted
fur
jaguars
are
difficult
to
see
in
the
dense
jungle
canopy
researchers
discovered
their
behaviour
after
nearly
a
decade
of
studying
them
from
floating
bases
braving
the
same
conditions
that
put
flood
waters
at
the
doorsteps
of
more
than
people
living
in
the
mamirauá
reserve
on
one
expedition
last
month
researchers
with
headlamps
tracked
down
and
tranquilized
a
black
male
jaguar
at
night
placed
his
limp
body
on
a
blue
tarp
and
wrapped
his
head
in
a
towel
as
they
fitted
him
with
a
black
tracking
collar
measured
his
teeth
and
checked
his
vitals
so
many
jaguars
have
been
fitted
with
trackers
that
researchers
can
now
pinpoint
them
by
holding
up
pronged
radio
receivers
as
they
pilot
small
boats
through
the
flooded
forest
ramalho
says
that
understanding
this
behaviour
is
further
evidence
supporting
the
need
to
preserve
the
amazon
floodplain
the
iauaretê
project
has
teamed
up
with
the
uakari
lodge
in
the
reserve
which
is
operated
by
an
association
of
local
residents
to
offer
ecotourism
trips
that
take
advantage
of
the
trackers
to
allow
tourists
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
animals
the
goal
is
to
raise
awareness
for
conservation
and
generate
income
for
residents
a
trip
to
see
jaguars
living
in
trees
costs
reais
per
person
ecotourism
fosters
better
relations
between
jaguars
and
residents
who
are
sometimes
fearful
or
angry
because
jaguars
can
eat
livestock
and
pets
local
resident
railgler
dos
santos
a
field
assistant
on
the
project
says
seeing
the
intense
black
eyes
of
a
jaguar
staring
out
from
the
jungle
has
stayed
with
him
there
s
definitely
a
connection
there
having
the
fortune
of
seeing
the
animal
face
to
face
