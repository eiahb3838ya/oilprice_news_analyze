he
said
he
was
not
sure
yet
how
much
of
the
estimated

barrels
was
recoverable

the
kingdom
aims
to
attract
foreign

gas
firms
to
develop
the
resources
the
newly

resource
which

expect
to
be

provide
significant
and
positive
benefits

statement
sadad
a
former
senior
executive
at
saudi
aramco
and
now
an
energy
consultant
said
the
discovery
was
positive
news
for
bahrain
but
more
data
gathering
evaluation
and
well
testing
needed
to
follow
to
determine
whether
there
are
any
future
commercial
opportunities
in
the
resources
converting
resource
estimates
to
reserves
is
an
intense
and
costly
process
and
not
all
the
resources
may
ultimately
be
upgraded
to
reserves
he
said
the
additional
drilling
and
data
gathering
will
serve
