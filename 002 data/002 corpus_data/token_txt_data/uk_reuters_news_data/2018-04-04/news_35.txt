and
china
a
small
but
vocal
online
community
is
calling
for
a
boycott
of
products
fanning
fears
that
american
brands
could
see
a
backlash
similar
to
that
faced
by
south
korea
last
year
china
on
wednesday
hit
back
at
the
trump
administration
s
plans
to
impose
tariffs
on

in
chinese

retaliating
with
a
list

on
key

including
soybeans
planes
cars
whiskey
and

on
china

microblogging
platform
on

viewed
about
million
times
while
an
editorial
published
the
same
day
in
the
tabloid
global
times
warning
the
united
states
against
an
entering
a
trade
war
drew
roughly
comments
the
sons
and
daughters
of
china
should
unite
and
boycott
products
modern
war
is
conducted
by
the
people
said
one
weibo
user
with
the
handle
a
commenter
on
the
global
times
article
said
if
they
resist
chinese
products
the
united
states
won
t
be
able
to
find
an
alternative
but
if
we
boycott
all
products
products
can
easily
fill
the
gap
products
online
commenters
called
for
boycotting
included
boeing
planes
apple
products
soybeans
and
even
american
graduate
schools
with
others
saying
that
they
could
repeat
what
chinese
shoppers
had
done
to
south
korea
i
resolutely
support
all
trade
measures
china
is
taking
against
the
united
states
said
another
user
who
said
he
would
boycott
and
south
korean
products
it
starts
with
however
there
was
no
evidence
yet
of
an
organised
campaign
to
stoke
behaviour
or
that
consumers
were
yet
shunning
goods
in
any
numbers
trade
and
business
exchanges
between
south
korea
and
china
turned
chilly
last
year
after
south
korea
deployed
the
terminal
high
altitude
area
defence
thaad
system
despite
vehement
objections
from
beijing
the
thaad
disagreement
prompted
an
undeclared
chinese
boycott
of
products
ranging
from
south
korean
cosmetics
to
cars
and
was
estimated
to
have
knocked
about
percentage
points
off
south
korea
s
expected
economic
growth
in
the
highest
profile
corporate
casualty
was
south
korean
conglomerate
lotte
group
which
saw
its
plans
for
mega
shopping
complexes
indefinitely
suspended
and
nearly
all
of
its
lotte
mart
stores
in
china
shut
for
much
of
the
year
over
alleged
fire
safety
issues
ben
cavender
an
analyst
at
china
market
research
group
said
businesses
in
china
such
as
starbucks
were
more
firmly
entrenched
in
the
country
making
them
less
likely
to
receive
similar
treatment
a
lot
of
the
brands
are
employing
chinese
workers
essentially
they
re
chinese
companies
in
their
own
right
he
said
however
he
warned
that
everyday
consumption
goods
could
nonetheless
be
hit
you
can
see
consumers
saying
we
re
not
going
to
buy
a
ford
or
a
gm
product
and
we
re
going
to
buy
a
european
product
or
a
chinese
product
instead
he
said
jim
boyce
a
wine
consultant
who
writes
the
blog
grapewallofchina
said
while
there
were
concerns
that
the
duties
would
make
wine
less
the
greater
worry
was
over
the
image
the
trade
war
would
generate
for
goods
on
monday
china
imposed
extra
tariffs
on
imports
of
american
goods
including
wine
in
response
to
duties
on
steel
and
aluminium
imports
are
we
going
to
see
people
in
china
worried
about
drinking
american
wine
because
of
politics
that
s
the
bigger
problem
he
said
christopher
beros
trade
director
for
china
and
the
pacific
rim
at
the
california
wine
institute
which
represented
roughly
california
wineries
said
the
issue
was
making
him
nervous
we
do
see
collective
thinking
from
time
to
time
and
if
someone
gets
stigmatised
in
a
way
that
s
always
