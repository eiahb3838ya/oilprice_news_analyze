pablo
kuczynski
s
critics
call
it
his
last
act
hours
before
the
former
wall
street
banker
resigned
peru
s
presidency
in
scandal
last
month
kuczynski
signed
five
oil
contracts
granting
tullow
oil
exploration
and
drilling
rights
off
peru
s
northern
coast
lawmakers
have
vowed
to
investigate
and
try
to
repeal
the
contracts
they
say
there
should
have
been
a
public
auction
an
environmental
study
and
consultations
with
fishermen
biologists
and
coastal
residents
about
sites
that
lie
in
an
important
fisheries
area
rich
in
biodiversity
critics
are
unconvinced
by
peru
s
oil
promoting
agency
perupetro
which
said
the
contracts
followed
months
of
negotiations
and
should
be
celebrated
for
the
million
investment
they
will
bring
to
a
country
where
bidding
rounds
are
often
cancelled
due
to
lack
of
interest
it
s
not
normal
for
a
president
just
before
resigning
to
sign
five
decrees
giving
away
our
resources
said
congresswoman
karla
schaefer
with
the
conservative
party
popular
force
given
kuczynski
s
background
it
raises
a
lot
of
kuczynski
s
less
than
two
years
in
office
featured
clashes
with
popular
force
lawmakers
who
depicted
him
as
an
unscrupulous
lobbyist
he
resigned
after
being
implicated
in
an
alleged
scheme
to
prevent
possible
impeachment
over
payments
his
consulting
firm
received
from
odebrecht
a
company
at
the
centre
of
a
massive
graft
scandal
kuczynski
denies
wrongdoing
and
has
promised
to
cooperate
with
public
prosecutors
investigating
him
kuczynski
s
lawyer
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
about
tullow
oil
the
company
has
been
cautiously
reviving
its
search
for
new
oil
and
gas
resources
after
emerging
from
one
of
the
longest
downturns
in
the
sector
s
history
with
a
billion
debt
pile
for
foreign
investors
in
one
of
latin
america
s
most
stable
economies
the
latest
controversy
brought
reminders
of
a
how
a
more
than
yearlong
graft
scandal
involving
odebrecht
has
heightened
scrutiny
of
government
contracts
and
fuelled
political
feuds
in
peru
tullow
said
it
started
direct
negotiations
with
perupetro
as
allowed
by
peruvian
law
in
november
both
the
terms
and
conditions
of
our
contracts
and
the
process
for
approving
them
are
similar
to
those
signed
with
other
oil
companies
in
it
said
in
a
statement
but
leftist
lawmaker
hernando
cevallos
said
peru
s
new
president
martin
vizcarra
should
rescind
the
contracts
this
area
is
the
source
of
percent
of
our
fishing
cevallos
said
vizcarra
s
office
declined
to
comment
yuri
hooker
a
marine
biologist
who
researches
undersea
life
in
peru
said
three
of
tullow
s
oil
concessions
contain
high
levels
of
biodiversity
this
whole
area
is
one
of
the
most
important
breeding
places
in
the
pacific
for
whales
and
dolphins
as
well
as
fish
and
invertebrate
species
on
the
verge
of
extinction
said
hooker
the
former
head
of
perupetro
francisco
garcia
said
tullow
will
have
to
secure
environmental
approvals
before
drilling
and
denied
anything
irregular
about
the
contracts
a
minor
oil
producer
peru
has
struggled
to
lure
investments
to
its
prospects
as
bigger
players
in
the
region
such
as
mexico
have
grown
more
competitive
by
cutting
red
tape
now
all
we
re
doing
is
driving
companies
away
garcia
said
adding
that
he
resigned
last
month
because
most
of
his
time
was
spent
responding
to
lawmakers
