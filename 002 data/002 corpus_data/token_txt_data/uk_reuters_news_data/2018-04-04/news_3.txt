chinese
importers
expecting
cargoes
of
commodities
from
beef
to
propane
said
they
hope
to
sell
the
goods
to
south
korea
or
japan
after
beijing
s
decision
to
slap
extra
tariffs
on
a
swathe
of
items
from
agricultural
products
to
chemicals
beijing
on
wednesday
hit
back
against
the
trump
administration
s
plans
to
impose
tariffs
on
billion
in
chinese
goods
retaliating
with
a
list
of
similar
duties
on
key
imports
including
soybeans
planes
cars
whiskey
and
chemicals
the
speed
of
china
s
move
stunned
financial
markets
traders
of
soybeans
of
which
china
is
the
largest
importer
said
they
were
bracing
for
mass
cancellations
of
purchases
even
though
the
united
states
is
the
country
s
supplier
prices
of
soybeans
shipped
from
ports
in
the
pacific
northwest
the
most
direct
route
to
asia
dropped
by
to
per
ton
on
wednesday
soybean
traders
said
buyers
of
propane
used
for
making
ethylene
and
propylene
are
looking
to
swap
shipments
for
middle
eastern
barrels
with
buyers
in
south
korea
and
japan
even
though
we
are
committed
to
supplies
we
could
swap
them
for
middle
east
cargoes
with
korean
or
japanese
buyers
by
paying
them
per
ton
extra
freight
cost
said
a
manager
with
an
east
chemical
plant
that
buys
propane
and
who
gave
only
his
surname
zhong
china
bought
million
tonnes
of
propane
last
year
worth
some
billion
or
percent
of
its
total
imports
the
additional
tariffs
will
likely
hit
exporters
such
as
enterprise
product
partners
and
phillips
and
give
a
boost
to
rivals
in
the
middle
east
like
qatar
and
saudi
arabia
the
market
will
be
thrown
into
some
initial
chaos
and
the
freight
market
will
also
be
affected
diversions
and
swaps
mean
the
demand
for
tankers
will
be
lower
as
voyages
are
shorter
to
northeast
asia
and
also
shorter
from
the
middle
east
to
china
said
a
senior
dealer
with
jovo
energy
the
tariffs
on
beef
were
not
expected
to
have
much
impact
on
the
chinese
market
which
had
only
resumed
imports
from
the
last
year
after
a
hiatus
china
bought
just
tonnes
of
beef
in
worth
million
according
to
chinese
customs
less
than
percent
of
total
imports
but
the
move
could
increase
supplies
of
coveted
items
like
short
ribs
to
other
asian
countries
like
japan
and
south
korea
pressuring
prices
currently
at
record
levels
