eastern
airlines
corp
ltd
said
a
brewing
trade
war
between
china
and
the
united
states
could
prompt
it
to
adjust
capacity
and
frequency
on
associated
routes
in
the
expectation
that
it
may
impact
passenger
travel
and
cargo
china
s
second
largest
carrier
by
passenger
numbers
said
it
had
set
up
a
group
to
study
the
issue
the
trump
administration
on
tuesday
imposed
percent
tariffs
on
some
chinese
products
while
china
has
put
tariffs
on
fruit
and
nuts
chief
executive
ma
xulun
said
at
a
news
conference
on
wednesday
that
the
trade
war
could
have
a
certain
impact
on
passenger
and
cargo
business
we
will
make
some
adjustment
to
our
fleet
if
passenger
numbers
fall
on
routes
for
example
by
switching
the
boeing
to
the
airbus
if
the
impact
is
more
severe
we
may
make
adjustments
to
airline
frequency

the
airline
which
last
week
reported
its
highest
annual
profit
in
more
than
years
also
said
it
was
looking
forward
to
the
launch
of
china
s
crude
futures
contracts
and
would
consider
buying
when
the
appropriate
timing
and
opportunity
arises
oil
futures
isc
were
launched
last
month
becoming
china
s
first
commodity
derivative
open
to
foreign
investors
they
are
also
the
culmination
of
a
push
by
the
shanghai
futures
exchange
to
give
the
world
s
largest
energy
consumer
more
power
in
pricing
crude
sold
to
asia
unlike
many
of
their
overseas
peers
chinese
airlines
do
not
hedge
fuel
buys
after
they
suffered
heavy
losses
in
this
helped
when
oil
prices
plunged
in
but
has
since
left
them
vulnerable
as
prices
rise
