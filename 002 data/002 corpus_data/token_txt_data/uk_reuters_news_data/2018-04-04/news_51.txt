vestas taps car battery know-how for wind power storage
copenhagen
reuters
the
world
s
largest
wind
turbine
maker
vestas
is
tapping
into
experience
from
the
car
battery
industry
to
try
to
address
the
challenge
of
using
erratic
wind
and
solar
energy
to
meet
a
growing
share
of
power
demand
energy
storage
is
becoming
increasingly
important
as
production
of
renewable
energy
rises
because
the
wind
might
not
blow
or
the
sun
shine
during
the
peak
hours
when
most
consumers
turns
on
their
lights
and
appliances
in
order
to
bring
down
cost
of
renewable
energy
and
help
grid
operators
balance
intermittent
output
vestas
last
year
said
it
would
work
to
combine
wind
solar
and
battery
storage
technology
as
part
of
this
it
invested
million
euros
million
in
battery
manufacturer
northvolt
which
aims
to
build
europe
s
biggest
battery
cell
plant
with
the
backing
of
investors
such
as
truckmaker
scania
we
can
piggyback
on
all
the
research
they
do
with
batteries
for
cars
and
get
an
excellent
industry
battery
at
the
same
time
vestas
chairman
bert
nordberg
told
reuters
vestas
is
partnering
with
sweden
s
northvolt
headed
by
former
tesla
executive
peter
carlsson
to
develop
a
battery
for
power
plants
of
the
future
battery
costs
have
traditionally
been
high
but
the
technology
is
becoming
increasingly
viable
as
automakers
such
as
bmw
daimler
volkswagen
and
volvo
car
group
ramp
up
electric
car
production
nordberg
said
the
investment
into
northvolt
meant
vestas
could
demand
development
and
research
into
the
kind
of
battery
storage
it
is
interested
in
and
would
also
be
able
to
place
people
there
vestas
is
also
working
with
bigger
players
such
as
electric
carmaker
tesla
whose
batteries
it
plans
to
use
in
the
world
s
first
project
for
this
technology
to
store
power
from
both
wind
and
solar
sources
the
output
from
solar
and
wind
is
very
intermittent
and
we
need
to
even
that
out
nordberg
said
nordberg
is
part
of
a
swedish
trio
which
also
includes
ceo
anders
runevad
and
finance
chief
marika
frederiksson
that
has
turned
vestas
around
and
helped
by
cost
cutting
lifted
the
company
s
operating
margin
to
industry
leading
levels
vestas
will
continue
to
make
acquisitions
within
storage
and
hybrid
energy
solutions
he
said
but
declined
to
say
how
much
it
might
spend
or
which
targets
it
was
considering
the
idea
is
that
we
should
be
a
technology
company
we
are
not
trying
to
move
into
buying
and
selling
wind
parks
