exclusive-epa gives giant refiner a 'hardship' waiver from regulation
new
york
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
has
exempted
one
of
the
nation
s
largest
oil
refining
companies
andeavor
from
complying
with
biofuels
regulations
a
waiver
historically
reserved
for
tiny
operations
in
danger
of
going
belly
up
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
the
exemption
which
applies
to
the
three
smallest
of
andeavor
s
ten
refineries
marks
the
first
evidence
of
the
epa
freeing
a
highly
profitable
dollar
company
from
the
costly
mandates
of
the
renewable
fuel
standard
the
law
requires
refiners
to
blend
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
into
gasoline
or
purchase
credits
from
those
who
do
such
blending
the
decision
which
has
not
been
previously
reported
raises
the
question
of
whether
other
big
and
profitable
oil
firms
with
small
refineries
such
as
exxon
mobil
corp
xom
chevron
corp
and
phillips
also
have
or
could
receive
the
waivers
which
are
granted
by
the
epa
in
secret
such
waivers
were
designed
for
refineries
producing
less
than
barrels
per
day
that
can
demonstrate
that
they
suffer
a
disproportionate
economic
hardship
from
the
costs
of
rfs
compliance
andeavor
posted
net
profits
of
about
billion
last
year
the
epa
exemption
granted
about
a
month
ago
could
reduce
andeavor
s
regulatory
costs
by
more
than
million
this
year
based
on
the
number
of
biofuels
credits
that
two
brokers
say
the
refiner
recently
sold
into
the
market
along
with
previous
disclosures
by
firms
that
own
refineries
of
a
similar
size
biofuels
credit
prices
tied
to
ethanol
dropped
by
cents
to
cents
each
after
reuters
reported
andeavor
s
exemption
traders
said
andeavor
shares
jumped
by
more
than
percent
on
the
news
hitting
a
session
high
of
bob
dinneen
head
of
the
renewable
fuels
association
reacted
to
the
report
by
calling
the
exemption
an
outrageous
abuse
of
the
law
providing
a
small
refiner
waiver
to
a
company
like
andeavor
is
laughable
and
abandons
the
commitment
of
president
trump
to
protect
the
rfs
he
said
in
a
statement
senator
chuck
grassley
a
republican
who
represents
iowa
the
nation
s
largest
state
and
a
staunch
defender
of
the
biofuels
program
raised
questions
over
the
legality
of
the
exemption
giving
andeavor
a
free
pass
when
other
companies
are
required
to
follow
the
law
of
the
land
isn
t
just
unfair
it
may
be
illegal
grassley
said
late
tuesday
in
a
statement
to
reuters
it
would
also
amount
to
a
massive
government
handout
to
a
big
corporation
that
made
billions
in
profits
just
last
the
exemption
releases
the
firm
of
its
obligation
to
provide
the
epa
with
biofuels
credits
proving
compliance
at
the
three
refineries
two
located
in
north
dakota
and
one
in
utah
for
the
year
which
would
have
come
due
this
year
the
sources
said
andeavor
is
also
asking
epa
for
a
waiver
for
its
obligations
for
the
same
refineries
but
has
not
yet
received
a
decision
the
sources
said
andeavor
spokeswoman
destin
singleton
declined
to
comment
epa
spokeswoman
liz
bowman
did
not
immediately
comment
in
response
to
reuters
inquiries
on
monday
and
tuesday
as
a
matter
of
policy
the
agency
refuses
to
release
any
information
on
the
waivers
or
to
name
their
recipients
citing
concerns
over
disclosing
private
business
information
the
epa
denied
a
freedom
of
information
act
request
from
reuters
seeking
information
on
companies
receiving
the
waivers
exxon
mobil
chevron
and
phillips
also
own
refineries
small
enough
to
meet
the
standard
as
does
billionaire
investor
and
trump
ally
carl
icahn
whose
efforts
last
year
to
overhaul
the
biofuels
program
drew
scrutiny
from
federal
investigators
icahn
majority
owner
of
refiner
cvr
energy
had
served
as
an
advisor
to
trump
on
regulatory
issues
during
his
push
to
reform
biofuels
regulations
early
last
year
but
he
resigned
amid
allegations
that
the
role
gave
him
a
conflict
of
interest
spokespeople
for
all
four
companies
declined
to
comment
on
whether
they
had
applied
for
or
received
any
exemptions
the
lucrative
waivers
are
typically
only
reported
if
a
firm
considers
them
to
be
material
to
their
financial
or
operational
performance
in
which
case
they
must
disclose
the
information
through
securities
and
exchange
commission
filings
the
rfs
has
long
been
a
lightning
rod
of
conflict
between
the
corn
lobby
which
supports
the
policy
as
an
engine
for
demand
and
refiners
who
say
it
costs
them
a
fortune
the
white
house
has
sought
to
broker
a
deal
between
two
of
its
key
political
constituencies
in
a
series
of
meetings
but
the
effort
has
failed
to
yield
policy
changes
acceptable
to
both
sides
ethanol
industry
advocates
argue
exemptions
for
refiners
undermine
the
intent
of
the
law
originally
designed
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
reduce
dependence
on
foreign
oil
and
boost
farm
economies
while
the
epa
s
motives
in
providing
hardship
waivers
are
unclear
the
exemptions
are
one
of
the
tools
at
the
administration
s
disposal
to
ease
financial
pressure
on
refiners
without
undertaking
a
reform
of
the
rfs
policy
epa
chief
scott
pruitt
appointed
by
trump
has
repeatedly
said
the
rfs
is
too
costly
to
oil
refiners
and
should
be
overhauled
but
trump
s
secretary
of
agriculture
sonny
perdue
told
an
agriculture
conference
in
february
that
trump
stands
with
corn
farmers
biofuels
farmers
and
the
rfs
according
to
a
recording
heard
by
reuters
white
house
spokeswoman
kelly
love
did
not
respond
to
a
question
about
whether
the
administration
was
expanding
the
use
of
the
rfs
waivers
to
help
refiners
bowman
of
the
epa
also
did
not
comment
on
the
question
andeavor
s
waiver
follows
a
successful
lawsuit
by
another
refiner
sinclair
oil
last
year
challenging
the
strict
standard
the
epa
has
used
under
past
administrations
for
determining
financial
hardship
the
epa
s
interpretation
takes
the
statutory
language
too
far
wrote
chief
judge
timothy
tymkovich
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
denver
a
hardship
is
something
that
makes
one
s
life
hard
or
difficult
not
just
something
that
makes
continued
existence
the
lawsuit
along
with
a
perception
that
the
trump
administration
might
be
more
sympathetic
to
refiners
has
sparked
a
big
increase
in
applications
from
refining
firms
for
he
exemptions
this
year
more
than
refineries
have
sought
the
waivers
according
to
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
in
a
typical
year
the
epa
would
receive
about
to
requests
for
hardship
exemptions
and
would
grant
about
half
of
them
a
former
official
familiar
with
the
program
told
reuters
andeavor
sold
some
million
of
those
credits
to
its
competitors
in
recent
weeks
according
to
two
brokers
in
the
biofuels
credit
market
the
company
otherwise
would
have
needed
to
provide
those
credits
to
the
epa
to
prove
compliance
with
the
rfs
those
credits
would
be
worth
about
million
based
on
a
reuters
calculation
of
average
renewable
fuel
rin
prices
this
year
in
the
past
other
companies
have
said
the
exemptions
they
were
granted
saved
them
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
according
to
securities
and
exchange
commission
filings
last
year
for
example
hollyfrontier
disclosed
a
reduction
of
almost
million
in
its
costs
of
credits
for
two
refineries
for
refiners
granted
exemptions
win
in
two
ways
they
no
longer
have
to
blend
biofuels
or
buy
credits
to
comply
with
the
law
and
they
can
sell
any
credits
they
had
previously
purchased
to
use
for
compliance
