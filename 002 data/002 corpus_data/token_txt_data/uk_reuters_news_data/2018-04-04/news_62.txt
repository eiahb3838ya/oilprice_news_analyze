vietnam
plans
to
raise
taxes
on
fuels
starting
in
july
to
reduce
pollution
and
pay
off
public
debt
the
finance
ministry
said
on
wednesday
though
analysts
caution
the
levy
could
increase
inflation
and
hurt
businesses
in
the
country
vietnam
will
raise
the
environment
tax
on
gasoline
by
percent
to
dong
per
litre
the
ministry
of
finance
said
on
its
website
taxes
on
diesel
fuel
coal
and
lubricants
would
also
increase
though
the
ministry
did
not
indicate
by
how
much
the
planned
tax
hike
is
part
of
a
move
to
restructure
the
state
budget
with
an
aim
to
ensure
the
safety
and
stability
of
the
national
finance
system
deputy
finance
minister
vu
thi
mai
said
in
the
statement
the
tax
hike
is
also
part
of
vietnam
s
strategy
to
limit
products
that
cause
pollution
the
ministry
said
as
southeast
asia
s
economy
vietnam
is
facing
a
pollution
problem
the
capital
hanoi
enjoyed
little
more
than
one
month
of
clean
air
last
year
according
to
a
january
report
by
the
green
innovation
and
development
centre
the
government
must
also
keep
its
public
debt
below
percent
of
its
gross
domestic
product
and
the
new
tax
will
be
used
to
pay
down
that
debt
there
are
concerns
however
that
the
higher
tax
will
raise
costs
for
businesses
and
consumers
this
would
definitely
hit
businesses
as
they
would
have
to
face
higher
input
costs
leaving
them
less
competitive
said
economist
cao
si
kiem
a
former
governor
of
the
state
bank
of
vietnam
the
statement
also
said
the
tax
increase
would
compensate
for
the
decline
in
import
and
export
tax
revenues
as
vietnam
integrates
further
into
the
global
market
the
country
has
signed
around
a
dozen
free
trade
agreements
that
will
remove
or
reduce
taxes
on
several
imports
if
approved
by
the
government
the
tax
increase
would
raise
inflation
by
to
percentage
points
in
mai
said
vietnam
has
set
an
inflation
target
of
percent
for
this
year
the
tax
hike
will
result
in
higher
input
costs
for
enterprises
with
those
operating
in
the
transport
and
logistics
industry
being
hurt
first
said
can
van
luc
and
economist
with
the
bank
for
investment
and
development
of
vietnam
but
it
s
necessary
to
combat
environmental
pollution
for
sustainable
growth

vietnam
