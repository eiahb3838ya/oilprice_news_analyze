the

president
donald

has
insisted
trade
wars
are
winnable
and
pushed
his
officials
to
increase
the
scope
of
the
target
list
for
its
part
china
has
appeared
anxious
to
avert
a
trade
conflict
but
threatened
a
proportionate
response
to
any
unilateral
action
both
sides
have
been
careful
to
leave
time
for
further
negotiations
in
an
effort
to
prevent
the
tariffs
from
taking
effect
most
investors
still
seem
convinced
a
deal
can
be
reached
without
damaging
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
the
trump
administration
has
a
track
record
of
announcing
aggressive
and
trade
policies
and
then
diluting
or
abandoning
them
in
the
face
of
stiff
opposition
and
in
exchange
for
comparatively
minor
concessions
trade
wars
however
are
like
real
wars
in
that
they
are
easy
to
start
but
once
underway
the
course
is
unpredictable
and
they
can
be
difficult
to
halt
as
a
result
trade
war
between
the
united
states
and
china
must
be
seen
as
one
of
the
biggest
risks
to
the
global
economy
and
commodity
prices
in
and
neither
trump
nor
chinese
president
xi
jinping
can
afford
to
be
seen
to
lose
a
trade
conflict
or
make
many
concessions
without
securing
something
in
return
trump
made
trade
a
central
plank
of
his
presidential
campaign
in
and
faces
tough
congressional
elections
in
just
seven
months
fair
trade
and
dealing
with
china
s
perceived
abuses
is
an
important
issue
for
the
president
s
core
supporters
and
has
qualified
backing
from
some
elements
of
the
business
community
in
china
xi
has
just
been
as
communist
party
chief
and
had
the
constitution
changed
to
allow
him
to
extend
his
tenure
as
president
based
largely
on
his
promise
of
strong
leadership
like
a
real
war
the
trade
measures
announced
by
both
sides
are
largely
for
domestic
political
consumption
and
designed
to
play
to
a
nationalist
audience
behind
the
scenes
both
sides
are
trying
to
negotiate
a
settlement
and
have
been
leaking
some
details
to
the
media
in
an
effort
to
calm
concerns
about
the
economic
impact
there
are
plenty
of
possible
options
to
settle
the
dispute
the
problem
is
that
any
compromise
must
allow
both
sides
to
save
face
and
that
will
be
much
harder
now
that
tariffs
have
been
announced
both
sides
are
likely
to
come
under
business
and
economic
pressure
to
avoiding
a
major
disruption
of
global
trade
and
with
it
the
increased
likelihood
of
a
recession
but
with
the
domestic
political
credibility
of
the
leaders
of
both
countries
now
on
the
line
just
as
in
a
real
war
the
scope
for
a
mutually
has
narrowed
the
trade
conflict
is
really
just
one
aspect
of
the
increasing
strategic
competition
between
the
united
states
and
china
the
united
states
wants
to
maintain
its
military
diplomatic
and
economic
superiority
over
all
other
countries
while
china
is
determined
not
to
accept
second
place
and
to
achieve
parity
the
problem
has
been
termed
the
thucydides
trap
after
the
conflict
in
ancient
greece
between
sparta
the
incumbent
superpower
and
athens
the
rising
superpower
that
led
to
the
peloponnesian
war
the
problem
of
how
to
manage
the
rising
power
of
china
and
its
challenge
to
the
superiority
of
the
united
states
has
been
evident
for
two
decades
i
remember
discussing
it
frequently
with
colleagues
in
the
late
china
has
appeared
anxious
to
avoid
the
problem
and
the
xinhua
news
agency
has
published
numerous
articles
on
averting
the
thucydides
trap
in
recent
years
the
issue
has
been
extensively
discussed
by
officials
including
the
president
and
foreign
minister
as
well
as
in
opinion
commentaries
china
voice
ten
reasons
china
can
avoid
thucydides
trap
xinhua
even
with
this
level
of
awareness
however
the
two
countries
have
already
blundered
into
the
thucydides
trap
on
trade
the
list
of
areas
where
the
two
powers
are
in
increasingly
pointed
strategic
competition
now
covers
trade
overseas
investment
advanced
technology
naval
and
military
armaments
intensifying
diplomatic
competition
also
covers
multiple
regions
including
the
south
china
sea
southeast
asia
the
indian
ocean
central
asia
the
korean
peninsula
africa
and
latin
america
there
are
compelling
economic
reasons
for
the
united
states
and
china
to
avoid
imposing
extensive
tariffs
on
bilateral
trade
but
both
sides
face
tricky
domestic
political
constraints
it
is
possible
to
envisage
a
grand
bargain
that
can
resolve
many
if
not
all
of
the
outstanding
differences
between
the
two
countries
on
business
issues
there
is
still
time
for
negotiations
and
opportunities
for
a
mutually
deal
though
the
uncertainty
in
the
meantime
is
likely
to
be
extremely
damaging
and
just
as
real
wars
are
often
the
result
of
unpredictable
and
unplanned
escalation
trade
wars
can
also
spiral
out
of
control
