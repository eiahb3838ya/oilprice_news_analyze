offtakers face challenge as asia demand lags surging u.s. lng output

surging
production
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
and
slower
growth
of
demand
in
asia
this
year
could
leave
companies
that
have
committed
to
purchase
contracts
struggling
to
find
markets
several
european
and
asian
utilities
have
signed
up
to
deals
for
lng
that
last
to
years
when
they
signed
up
five
years
or
so
ago
buyers
were
confident
asia
could
soak
up
any
extra
supplies
produced
by
the
lng
industry
which
at
the
time
had
barely
got
going
but
forecasts
for
asian
lng
demand
have
been
reined
in
despite
strong
growth
in
china
last
year
while
output
has
been
shooting
up
capacity
is
expected
to
hit
million
tonnes
a
year
mtpa
by
the
end
of
from
mtpa
in
you
ve
seen
some
european
utilities
getting
into
the
and
i
m
not
sure
it
s
going
well
there
are
some
contracts
where
they
probably
wish
they
hadn
t
said
david
cox
who
runs
london
energy
consulting
asian
demand
is
still
expanding
china
s
lng
imports
in
december
climbed
percent
from
the
same
period
a
year
earlier
to
a
monthly
record
of
million
tonnes
but
the
surge
was
exceptional
the
spurt
at
the
end
of
the
year
was
in
part
due
to
chinese
firms
stockpiling
supplies
to
avoid
a
repeat
of
last
winter
s
gas
shortages
analysts
at
ihs
markit
and
wood
mackenzie
expect
growth
to
slow
to
percent
this
year
as
china
eases
up
on
its
push
to
switch
to
gas
from
coal
for
heating
as
a
result
some
companies
are
pinning
their
hopes
on
europe
when
cheniere
energy
started
two
new
lng
facilities
at
the
end
of
last
year
it
led
to
record
amounts
of
cargoes
heading
to
europe
the
equation
is
very
very
simple
at
the
moment
supply
is
coming
on
asia
is
growing
the
extent
to
which
supply
beats
asia
we
ll
see
supply
coming
into
europe
said
andrew
walker
vice
president
of
strategy
at
cheniere
marketing
europe
consumes
half
a
trillion
cubic
meters
of
natural
gas
a
year
far
more
than
the
total
global
lng
market
which
stood
at
mtpa
at
the
end
of
but
most
european
supplies
come
via
pipeline
much
of
it
from
russia
despite
washington
s
push
to
wean
european
states
off
those
supplies
there
is
little
sign
of
major
shift
yet
european
utilities
such
as
centrica
rwe
iberdrola
and
edf
do
not
face
an
immediate
crunch
some
contracts
only
kick
in
later
this
year
but
some
buyers
in
the
asian
market
have
already
been
offloading
commitments
to
buy
lng
including
australia
s
woodside
petroleum
gail
india
and
indonesia
s
pertamina
japan
s
toshiba
paid
million
to
transfer
its
obligation
to
buy
mtpa
from
a
terminal
europe
also
made
an
attractive
market
for
lng
when
shipping
rates
spiked
last
year
because
it
is
closer
than
asian
markets
to
terminals
which
lie
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
united
states
elena
sidorochkina
head
of

at
the

arm
of
austria
s

company
omv
said
high
shipping
rates
could
force
more
cooperation
and
partnerships
between
buyers
if
there
is
a
lack
of
shipping
the
offtakers
will
have
to
find
a
different
way
of
placing
them
cargoes
she
said
tokyo
gas
and
rwe
and
centrica
have
already
reached
deals
to
combine
some
shipping
and
delivery
arrangements
there
will
be
a
day
when
shipping
capacity
will
be
traded
in
the
same
way
you
trade
lng
you
will
have
shipping
futures
contracts
