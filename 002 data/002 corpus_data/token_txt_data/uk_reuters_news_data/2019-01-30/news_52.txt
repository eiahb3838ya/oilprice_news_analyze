update 3-siemens steels itself for eu rejection of rail merger with alstom
munich
reuters
siemens
will
accept
defeat
if
the
european
union
rejects
its
pleas
to
allow
it
to
combine
with
alstom
to
create
a
powerful
rail
business
having
offered
a
series
of
concessions
to
answer
competition
concerns
siemens
will
not
pursue
the
deal
at
any
costs
and
instead
make
new
plans
for
its
trains
business
chief
executive
joe
kaeser
said
before
the
german
company
s
annual
meeting
in
munich
on
wednesday
the
engineering
company
wants
to
create
a
european
rail
champion
to
compete
with
china
s
crrc
corp
but
its
ambitions
have
run
into
opposition
from
eu
regulators
concerned
about
the
impact
on
train
operators
we
are
not
bitter
we
are
not
angry
at
all
we
have
different
options
if
it
works
it
will
be
good
for
europe
siemens
alstom
and
for
customers
kaeser
said
if
not
we
will
continue
to
lead
in
mobility
as
we
have
before
said
kaeser
who
nevertheless
appeared
to
be
resigned
to
the
merger
being
rejected
the
eu
commission
is
due
to
announce
its
decision
by
with
indications
the
merger
will
be
rejected
siemens
would
be
unlikely
to
make
a
second
approach
to
a
new
eu
commission
after
the
european
elections
in
may
siemens
managing
board
member
roland
busch
said
a
new
commission
would
be
bound
by
the
same
laws
as
its
predecessor
and
changing
these
laws
would
take
years
busch
said
appealing
to
the
eu
kaeser
said
europe
needed
to
stand
together
to
compete
with
the
united
states
china
and
india
he
said
eu
competition
rules
from
the
were
from
a
different
era
that
were
now
outdated
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
if
the
future
of
mobility
in
europe
will
be
determined
by
technocrats
or
europeans
he
said
the
merger
aims
to
create
the
world
s
second
largest
rail
company
with
combined
revenues
of
around
billion
euros
billion
pounds
still
half
the
size
of
crrc
but
twice
that
of
canada
s
bombardier
the
plan
has
been
backed
by
siemens
shareholders
who
have
said
it
would
help
create
a
focussed
technology
group
although
countries
such
as
china
and
the
united
states
are
increasingly
ruthlessly
pursuing
their
own
industrial
policy
the
focus
of
the
competition
commission
is
on
the
task
of
protecting
consumers
and
ensuring
fair
competition
within
the
eu
said
marcus
poppe
fund
manager
at
german
asset
manager
dws
which
owns
percent
of
siemens
this
position
may
be
correct
under
current
european
law
but
fails
to
recognise
the
threats
to
the
european
industrial
sector
in
global
competition
over
the
next
years
eu
competition
commissioner
margrethe
vestager
has
described
siemens
and
alstom
as
world
champions
which
can
compete
without
a
merger
people
familiar
with
the
matter
have
told
reuters
regulators
were
minded
to
reject
it
the
german
