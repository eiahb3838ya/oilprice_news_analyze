reuters
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
accused
donald
trump
of
ordering
neighbouring
colombia
s
government
to
kill
him
but
said
he
was
open
to
the
possibility
of
talks
with
the
leader
and
his
own
domestic
foes
in
an
interview
with
russia
s
ria
agency
maduro
rejected
calls
for
an
early
election
said
an
order
to
arrest
his
rival
juan
guaido
had
not
yet
been
given
and
promised
caracas
would
honour
debts
to
russia
and
china
facing
the
biggest
challenge
of
his
rule
the
socialist
leader
also
said
his
armed
forces
remained
loyal
and
president
vladimir
putin
was
firmly
behind
him
maduro
s
comments
were
published
on
wednesday
as
the
fight
for
control
of
venezuela
escalated
with
the
government
preparing
an
investigation
into
interim
president
guaido
and
new
street
protests
planned
venezuela
plunged
further
into
turmoil
last
week
after
the
united
states
recognised
guaido
as
acting
president
while
russia
which
has
lent
caracas
an
estimated
billion
since
continued
to
back
maduro
donald
trump
has
without
doubt
given
an
order
to
kill
me
and
has
told
the
government
of
colombia
and
the
colombian
mafia
to
kill
me
maduro
told
ria
though
the
venezuelan
was
reprising
an
old
allegation
that
critics
scoff
at
as
a
smokescreen
there
was
speculation
of
military
plans
after
trump
adviser
john
bolton
appeared
on
monday
with
a
pad
showing
the
words
troops
to
if
something
happens
to
me
one
day
donald
trump
and
colombian
president
ivan
duque
will
bear
responsibility
maduro
said
of
his
foes
despite
their
increasingly
militant
opposition
to
maduro
whom
they
regard
as
a
dictator
both
washington
and
bogota
have
repeatedly
denied
accusations
of
plots
to
kill
him
maduro
who
survived
what
he
called
an
assassination
attempt
in
august
last
year
said
he
was
well
protected
guaranteeing
him
a
long
life
he
declined
to
comment
on
reports
russia
sent
private
military
contractors
to
help
guard
him
he
also
dismissed
calls
for
a
snap
presidential
vote
saying
his
last
year
was
fair
despite
widespread
allegations
of
fraud
and
the
barring
of
two
opposition
rivals
i
won
percent
of
the
vote
he
told
ria
i
won
legitimately
if
the
imperialists
want
a
new
election
let
them
wait
until
despite
alleging
trump
wanted
him
dead
maduro
said
he
was
ready
to
meet
him
wherever
he
wants
but
thought
the
prospect
unlikely
given
what
he
described
as
attempts
by
trump
s
advisers
to
prevent
it
he
said
mexico
uruguay
bolivia
russia
the
vatican
and
several
unnamed
european
countries
wanted
talks
between
him
and
the
opposition
i
am
ready
to
sit
at
the
negotiation
table
with
the
opposition
for
us
to
talk
for
the
benefit
of
venezuela
maduro
was
quoted
as
saying
regarding
the
investigation
and
possible
arrest
of
guaido
he
said
as
far
as
i
know
this
measure
has
not
yet
been
taken
let
s
wait
for
the
internal
constitutional
and
legal
processes
to
see
what
the
results
