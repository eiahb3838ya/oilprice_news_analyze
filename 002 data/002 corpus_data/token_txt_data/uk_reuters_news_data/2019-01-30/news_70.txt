days
after
a
fireball
erupted
near
the
mexican
town
of
tlahuelilpan
killing
at
least
people
pilfering
gasoline
from
a
pipeline
the
area
s
fuel
bandits
were
back
in
business
illegal
taps
some
of
them
newly
opened
were
the
giveaway
that
fuel
was
flowing
again
soldiers
patrolling
this
area
in
central
mexico
after
the
tragedy
told
reuters
they
found
illicit
spigots
just
a
few
kilometers
away
on
the
same
pipeline
operated
by
the
nation
s
oil
company
petroleos
mexicanos
or
pemex
in
one
spot
reuters
saw
a
freshly
dug
hole
leading
to
a
shiny
valve
attached
to
the
pipeline
lying
about
a
meter
underground
nearby
were
discarded
plastic
hoses
snack
wrappers
an
empty
pack
of
cigarettes
and
a
blanket
still
wet
with
gasoline
such
is
the
mammoth
task
confronting
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
who
has
vowed
to
end
mexico
s
rampant
fuel
theft
the
practice
is
depriving
the
government
of
badly
needed
tax
revenue
it
cost
pemex
an
estimated
billion
last
year
alone
security
experts
say
thieves
organized
crime
gangs
and
corrupt
pemex
employees
all
have
a
hand
in
the
trade
the
crudest
operators
hack
into
pipelines
to
siphon
gasoline
and
diesel
often
at
night
in
rural
outposts
they
then
resell
it
to
gas
station
owners
at
roadside
stands
and
in
markets
a
pemex
spokesperson
did
not
respond
to
multiple
requests
for
comment
in
december
lopez
obrador
announced
a
crackdown
on
the
banditry
to
thwart
pipeline
taps
he
ordered
pemex
to
transport
some
fuel
overland
in
tanker
trucks
the
result
widespread
shortages
and
long
lines
at
gas
stations
the
bottlenecks
have
eased
but
fuel
theft
is
so
endemic
that
the
culture
will
be
hard
to
break
even
in
tlahuelilpan
an
estimated
of
the
town
s
residents
many
carrying
buckets
had
flocked
to
a
nearby
pipeline
when
word
spread
on
social
media
that
a
large
pool
of
gasoline
had
sprung
from
a
bootleg
tap
dozens
were
killed
when
the
gas
ignited
scores
more
were
badly
burned
marcelino
valdez
a
catholic
priest
in
tlahuelilpan
said
in
between
funerals
that
many
here
support
lopez
obrador
but
he
doubted
the
president
s
strategy
would
yield
quick
results
in
an
area
where
nearly
of
the
population
lives
in
poverty
according
to
government
data
the
people
don
t
like
to
steal
it
s
not
something
they
enjoy
valdez
said
but
they
look
up
and
see
so
much
corruption
so
much
injustice
and
they
see
that
their
hands
are
for
a
graphic
on
mexico
fuel
theft
problem
see
hidalgo
state
where
tlahuelilpan
is
located
is
the
nation
s
leader
in
illicit
breaches
of
pemex
pipelines
fuel
thieves
known
as
huachicoleros
last
year
drilled
a
record
illegal
taps
in
the
state
or
nearly
six
each
day
according
to
pemex
data
that
is
more
than
a
increase
in
just
two
years
oil
industry
experts
say
hidalgo
s
location
is
a
big
reason
situated
to
the
north
of
the
mexican
capital
the
state
is
home
to
pemex
s
oil
refinery
and
critical
pipelines
supplying
the
giant
mexico
city
metro
area
fuel
prices
are
a
factor
too
at
the
start
of
the
government
of
enrique
pena
nieto
hiked
prices
by
as
much
as
percent
in
a
bid
to
end
costly
subsidies
a
move
many
in
tlahuelilpan
say
is
driving
theft
since
lopez
obrador
s
term
began
on
the
government
says
it
has
arrested
people
accused
of
stealing
fuel
it
has
frozen
bank
accounts
and
deployed
soldiers
to
guard
key
pemex
installations
including
the
tula
refinery
about
miles
km
southwest
of
tlahuelilpan
while
organized
crime
is
a
big
player
the
president
has
reserved
particular
disdain
for
pemex
blaming
crooked
company
insiders
for
much
of
the
illicit
trade
we
re
talking
about
a
plan
that
has
ties
inside
the
government
he
said
during
a
press
conference
juan
pedro
cruz
mayor
of
tlahuelilpan
likewise
is
suspicious
of
pemex
employees
he
told
reuters
he
visited
the
site
of
an
illegal
pipeline
tap
shortly
after
he
was
elected
in
cruz
said
he
watched
as
pemex
workers
carefully
covered
up
the
tap
without
disabling
it
what
message
did
that
send
to
me
cruz
said
they
were
going
to
use
it
cruz
has
faced
questions
too
following
the
january
accident
news
reports
linked
him
to
a
local
warehouse
that
once
was
used
to
store
stolen
fuel
cruz
denied
wrongdoing
he
said
pemex
solicited
his
help
in
finding
temporary
storage
for
gasoline
recovered
from
crooks
in
addition
to
arresting
fuel
thieves
lopez
obrador
has
launched
a
new
peso
monthly
scholarship
for
unemployed
mexican
youth
a
program
he
has
pitched
as
a
way
to
address
the
root
causes
of
crime
but
some
townspeople
in
tlahuelilpan
doubt
it
will
dissuade
many
young
people
from
seizing
what
some
see
as
their
only
opportunity
to
get
ahead
mariano
hernandez
a
local
math
teacher
said
some
fuel
thieves
can
clear
as
much
as
pesos
daily
they
say
i
d
rather
make
a
lot
of
money
for
one
or
two
years
than
live
many
years
in
poverty
hernandez
said
the
president
s
steepest
challenge
may
be
persuading
people
such
as
magali
ortiz
that
fuel
theft
is
worthy
of
such
scrutiny
her
husband
omar
vasquez
died
in
the
conflagration
two
other
relatives
are
missing
stealing
fuel
is
not
a
crime
ortiz
said
it
s
a
