thomson

foundation
in
africa
where
more
than
million
people
still
lack
access
to
electricity
renewable
power
is
seen
as
one
of
the
fastest
ways
to
get
energy
where
it
s
needed
particularly
to
remote
and
rural
areas
where
many
africans
live
but
one
big
challenge
stands
in
the
way
experts
say
too
few
trained
workers
able
to
plan
install
and
maintain
solar
wind
and
other
clean
energy
systems
in
goma
in
the
east
of
the
democratic
republic
of
congo
for
instance
we
ve
had
very
significant
challenges
finding
very
capable
talent
particularly
at
the
senior
management
level
said
kweku
yankson
head
of
human
resources
in
africa
for
bboxx
a
clean
energy
company
working
to
expand
systems
in
countries
from
rwanda
to
pakistan
rwanda
in
turn
has
what
yankson
described
as
a
big
pool
of
young
talent
but
still
relatively
few
people
trained
in
clean
energy
technology
yankson
said
overall
only
people
are
recorded
as
working
in
renewable
energy
in
africa
outside
south
africa
according
to
the
international
renewable
energy
agency
irena
that
is
just
percent
of
the
global
renewable
energy
workforce
and
fewer
than
the
number
of
people
who
work
on
wind
power
in
the
state
of
illinois
alone
irena
noted
but
with
demand
growing
for
renewable
energy
entrepreneurs
and
for
workers
in
product
assembly
sales
marketing
finance
and
intellectual
property
efforts
are
now
underway
to
provide
the
talent
needed
a
powering
jobs
campaign
launched
in
october
at
an
international
renewable
energy
conference
in
singapore
aims
to
train
up
to
a
million
people
globally
by
to
meet
demand
for
renewable
energy
workers
the
effort
led
by
power
for
all
an
organisation
that
promotes
more
use
of
decentralised
power
and
backed
by
the
schneider
electric
foundation
and
the
rockefeller
foundation
will
focus
on
building
skills
in
countries
where
electricity
access
is
very
low
said
gilles
vermot
desroches
director
of
sustainable
development
at
schneider
the
push
is
part
of
a
broader
global
campaign
to
fill
an
expected
million
jobs
related
to
expansion
of
renewable
energy
by
according
to
irena
estimates
that
expansion
is
focused
in
part
on
achieving
a
global
goal
of
providing
universal
access
to
affordable
reliable
sustainable
and
modern
energy
by
in
africa
lessons
are
being
drawn
from
india
which
has
trained
more
than
solar
electric
installers
in
the
past
two
years
as
part
of
a
effort
the
country
aims
to
train
a
total
of
installers
by
according
to
india
s
government
one
of
the
biggest
problems
facing
expansion
of
renewable
power
in
africa
is
that
systems
need
to
be
built
and
operated
in
remote
locations
where
it
can
be
harder
to
attract
and
retain
staff
said
yankson
of
bboxx
also
even
in
countries
such
as
rwanda
where
a
growing
number
of
multinational
companies
have
trained
large
numbers
of
young
workers
the
most
pressing
challenge
has
been
around
finding
very
capable
and
experienced
managing
directors
and
finding
senior
finance
managers
he
said
in
kenya
yankson
said
the
difficulty
is
cost
skilled
talent
comes
at
high
salaries
thanks
to
competition
for
the
best
people
in
nairobi
among
companies
and
groups
the
main
limitation
we
ve
faced
in
kenya
has
been
the
cost
of
talent
he
said
to
provide
a
broader
pool
of
potential
hires
bboxx
has
created
the
bboxx
academy
an
online
learning
platform
that
offers
professional
courses
said
emery
nzirabatinya
a
former
learning
and
development
manager

now
works
in

for
a
hearing
aid
company

has
started
a
future

a
rigorous
development
and
exposure
program
at
bboxx

she
believes
the
training
will
help
me
increase
my

a
larger
potential
pool
of
talent
to
hire
i
am
now
working
on
real
projects
impacting
the
lives
of
thousands
of
rural
households
across
africa
she
said
the
push
for
more
trained
renewable
energy
workers
comes
as
an
increasing
number
of
countries
around
africa
try
to
ramp
up
use
of
renewable
energy
kenya
in
december
launched
a
new
national
electrification
strategy
that
includes
renewable
energy
systems
as
a
key
part
of
the
country
s
goal
of
achieving
percent
access
to
electricity
by
about
of
kenyans
currently
have
access
to
electricity
according
to
the
new
plan
part
of
kenya
s
push
is
an
solar
access
project
that
aims
to
connect
million
people
in
particularly
counties
said
isaac
kiva
secretary
of
renewable
energy
in
kenya
s
ministry
of
energy
we
are
also
now
working
with
our
education
system
to
develop
curricula
in
order
to
build
the
necessary
capacity
he

in
rwanda
the
government
is
collaborating
with
universities
including
carnegie
mellon
and
partnering
with
online
learning
efforts
to
provide
better
access
to
training
for
clean
energy
jobs
nzirabatinya
said
this
will
have
a
positive
impact
on
the
job
readiness
of
the
talent
pool
in
