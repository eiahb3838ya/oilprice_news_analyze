oil
prices
were
stable
on
wednesday
pressured
by
a
cloudy
outlook
for
the
global
economy
but
supported
by
worries
over
disruptions
to
supply
from
sanctions
on
venezuelan
exports

international
brent
crude
oil
futures
were
cent
above
their
last
close
at

this
followed
a
price
jump
the
previous
session
when
markets
first
digested
the
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
oil
exports
washington
on
monday
announced
export
sanctions
against
venezuela
s
oil
firm
pdvsa
limiting
transactions
between
companies
that
do
business
with
venezuela
through
purchases
of
crude
oil
and
sales
of
refined
products
the
sanctions
aim
to
freeze
sale
proceeds
from
pdvsa
s
exports
of
roughly
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
oil
to
the
united
states
they
are
the
toughest
financial
challenge
yet
to
venezuela
s
embattled
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
the
step
pushed
up
oil
prices
on
monday
but
markets
appeared
more
relaxed
on
tuesday
as
the
sanctions
only
impact
venezuelan
supply
to
the
united
states
the
venezuelan
export
volumes
will
not
be
eliminated
from
the
market
but
rather
rerouted
to
other
countries
said
paola
an
analyst
at
consultancy
rystad
energy
with
the
united
states
dropping
out
as
a
customer
for
venezuelan
oil
she
added
that
china
and
india
will
be
able
to
pick
up
these
oil
volumes
at
great
discounts
other
analysts
also
pointed
to
global
economic
weakness
as
countering
concerns
such
as
the
voluntary
supply
restraint
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
which
started
late
last
year
in
a
bid
to
tighten
the
market
and
prop
up
prices
the
venezuelan
political
crisis
as
well
as
a
saudi
pledge
to
lower
output
further
should
have
boosted
crude
oil
but
pulling
in
the
opposite
direction
are
heightened
concerns
about
global
growth
particularly
that
of
china
said
ole
hansen
head
of
commodity
strategy
at
denmark
s
saxo
bank
global
economic
growth
and
fuel
consumption
are
expected
to
slow
this
year
amid
a
trade
dispute
between
the

and
china
