not
appear
monumental

traders
who
sell
venezuelan
crude
to
the
united
states
are
looking
for
avenues
to
keep
crude
flowing
during
the
sanctions
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
discussions
while
companies
that
buy
venezuelan
oil
have
also
been
looking
for
seeking
counsel
for
instance
on
whether
the
use
of
intermediaries
such
as
commodity
merchants
can
continue
the
main
