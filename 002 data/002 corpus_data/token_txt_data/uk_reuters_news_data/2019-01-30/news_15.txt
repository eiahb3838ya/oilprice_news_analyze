the

slid
and
equities
surged
on
wednesday
fueled

pledging
to
be
patient
with

interest

change
in

stock
investors
interpreted
as
a
buy
signal
the

held
interest
rates
steady
at
the
end
of

struck

fell

got
what
they
were
hoping
for
said
mohamed
chief
economic
adviser
at
allianz
in
newport
beach
california
this
marks
a
full
from
what
the
fed
was
signaling
just
a
few
months
ago
said
scott
minerd
global
chief
investment
officer
at
guggenheim
partners
in
santa
monica
california
said
the
fed
s
pause
will
further
extend
the
economic
expansion
allowing
excesses
to
continue
to
build
and
increasing
risks
of
financial
instability
the
fed
refilled
the
punch
bowl
and
the
party
goes
on
buy

assets
