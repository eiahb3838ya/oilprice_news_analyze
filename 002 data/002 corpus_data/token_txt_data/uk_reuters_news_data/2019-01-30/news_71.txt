both

a

down
percent
in
november
from
the

period
the

air
new

said
there
was
a
trend
of
softening
inbound
tourism
traffic
as
well
as
a
weaker
domestic
leisure
travel
market
that
had
led

downgrade

a
new
range
of
nz
million

nz
million

said
new

s
total
annualised
tourism
growth
was
still
around
percent
in
the
months
ended

that
was
much
slower
than
the
roughly
percent
growth
hit
in
when
the
tourism
boom
was
at
its
height

the

there
s
a
variety
of
reasons

the
outlook
for

john
o
sullivan
said
growth
rates
in
chinese
arrivals
had
slowed
from
the
peak
as
the
market
matured
that
s
why
we
are
putting
more
focus
upon
repeat
visitation
encouraging
travel
out
of
peak
travel
periods
and
encouraging
our
chinese
visitors
to
venture
out
of
the
cities
and
explore
further
afield
