u.s. sanctions send venezuelans scrambling to fill gas tanks
guayana
venezuela
reuters
as
oil
companies
and
traders
worldwide
tried
to
decipher
the
impact
of
sanctions
slapped
on
venezuelan
state
oil
company
pdvsa
earlier
this
week
residents
of
the
south
american
country
had
a
familiar
response
get
in
line
snaking
sometimes
lines
formed
outside
pdvsa
gas
stations
amid
concerns
that
the
sanctions
intended
to
pressure
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
to
step
down
and
allow
opposition
leader
and
president
juan
guaido
to
hold
elections
would
choke
off
fuel
supply
i
am
going
to
fill
up
on
gasoline
just
in
case
because
of
the
united
states
sanctions
and
because
this
country
s
refineries
do
not
work
said
alberto
avila
a
elevator
technician
waiting
in
line
for
gas
at
a
station
in
eastern
ciudad
guayana
while
the
opec
nation
holds
the
world
s
largest
crude
oil
reserves
intermittent
gasoline
shortages
and
long
lines
for
groceries
and
medicine
have
become
the
new
normal
under
a
hyperinflationary
economic
collapse
crude
output
is
collapsing
due
to
underinvestment
refineries
operate
well
below
capacity
and
the
country
must
import
gasoline
mostly
from
the
united
states
to
meet
domestic
demand
pdvsa
now
buys
about
half
the
gasoline
venezuela
needs
according
to
internal
company
figures
in
the
first
eight
months
of
imports
from
the
united
states
rose
percent
to
barrels
per
day
data
from
the
energy
information
administration
show
the
sanctions
imposed
on
monday
ban
refineries
from
buying
oil
from
pdvsa
unless
they
pay
the
money
to
accounts
not
affiliated
with
the
maduro
government
which
washington
accuses
of
corruption
and
human
rights
violations
they
also
prevent
companies
from
exporting
goods
or
services
to
pdvsa
pdvsa
assured
venezuelans
in
a
twitter
post
that
fuel
supply
would
be
guaranteed
across
the
country
and
many
stations
were
operating
normally
attendants
said
but
some
motorists
like
carmen
lopez
a
dentist
decided
it
was
best
not
to
try
their
luck
she
left
her
house
in
the
central
city
of
valencia
at
and
waited
an
hour
to
fill
up
i
do
not
really
understand
how
the
new
sanctions
are
going
to
affect
us
but
just
in
case
i
am
keeping
my
tank
full
she
said
pdvsa
board
member
wills
rangel
told
reuters
the
company
was
already
having
problems
unloading
fuel
imports
from
tankers
for
domestic
use
because
the
sanctions
were
making
it
difficult
to
complete
payments
rangel
also
a
union
leader
said
the
company
had
inventories
to
cover
about
a
month
s
worth
of
consumption
but
sources
within
pdvsa
estimate
stocks
are
closer
to
days
while
venezuelans
were
wary
of
how
the
sanctions
might
affect
their
already
shaky
access
to
basic
goods
some
opponents
of
maduro
were
willing
to
put
up
with
it
because
they
thought
the
restrictions
would
hasten
his
exit
this
can
not
go
on
said
antonio
rodriguez
a
merchant
in
the
spot
in
line
to
enter
a
caracas
pdvsa
station
where
only
two
of
five
pumps
were
working
but
if
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
country
we
have
to
make
the
additional
reporting

deisy
buitrago

caracas
