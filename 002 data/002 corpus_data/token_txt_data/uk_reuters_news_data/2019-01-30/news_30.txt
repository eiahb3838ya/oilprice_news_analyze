as

had
committed
to

its

price
of
norwegian
crowns
and
that
those
investors
could
not

nasdaq
s
offer
is
the
latest
sign
of
moves
to
consolidate
among
stock
market
groups
the

nasdaq
which
already

seven
exchanges
across
the
nordic
and
baltic
countries
said
it
wanted
to
create
a
true
nordic
capital
market
it
is
a
long
way
from
paris
to
oslo
being
near
companies
is
important
oslo
bors
vps
ceo
bente
landsnes
told
a
news
conference
we
feel
that
being
part
of
nasdaq
would
make
it
easier
to
influence
future
any
deal
will
need
approval
from
norway
s
finance
ministry
and
its
financial
supervisory
authority
finanstilsynet
fsa
they
have
up
to
five
months
to
make
their
views
clear
landsnes
said
shareholders
who
committed
to
sell
to
euronext
would
be
able
to
sell
to
nasdaq
only
if
conditions
to
the
offer
such
as
regulatory
approvals
and
due
diligence
are
not
met
a
source
close
to
the
matter
said
there
will
be
two
applications
for
regulatory
approval
in
parallel
that
is
messy
to
seal
the
deal
they
euronext
could
up
the
offer
and
chase
off
nasdaq
the
source
said
finanstilsynet
will
base
its
processing
of
the
application
concerning
the
acquisition
of
a
significant
portion
of
oslo
bors
shares
on
current
regulations
and
can
not
make
any
further
comment
regarding
this
process
at
the
present
time
an
fsa
spokesman
said
according
to
norwegian
legislation
approval
can
only
be
given
if
the
buyer
is
considered
to
be
suitable
to
ensure
the
sound
and
prudent
management
of
oslo
bors
said
a
finance
ministry
spokeswoman
declining
to
give
specific
comments
about
the
nasdaq
or
euronext
offers
a
euronext
spokeswoman
reiterated
that
oslo
bors
shareholders
representing
more
than
percent
of
the
shares
had
committed
irrevocably
to
sell
their
shares
to
euronext
even
if
a
higher
bid
was
presented
by
another
company
euronext
also
owns
a
percent
stake
in
oslo
bors
it
bought
in
december
nasdaq
said
it
could
merge
oslo
bors
with
nasdaq
commodities
the
nordic
power
market
based
in
norway
you
can
safely
say
that
for
nasdaq
if
the
deal
goes
through
we
would
have
a
very
strong
center
of
excellence
for
commodities
in
oslo
nasdaq
nordic
president
lauri
rosendahl
told
reuters
he
did
not
give
a
specific
timeline
for
its
part
euronext
has
said
it
wants
to
use
oslo
bors
as
a
launchpad
for
nordic
expansion
and
a
center
for
its
commodities
activities
norwegian
bank
dnb
oslo
bors
biggest
shareholder
with
close
to
percent
said
it
would
sell
to
nasdaq
as
did
pension
provider
klp
which
holds
percent
and
sparebanken
vest
with
percent
stake
all
three
had
previously
suggested
they
would
not
accept
euronext
s
bid
with
the
options
that
are
now
available
we
believe
that
nasdaq
will
offer
the
strategically
best
solution
for
the
norwegian
capital
market
and
for
the
norwegian
central
securities
depository
vps
dnb
said
nasdaq
will
formally
launch
its
offer
on
and
its
application
for
regulatory
approval
would
follow
right
after
that
rosendahl
told
reuters
without
specifying
an
exact
date
founded
in
the
oslo
bors
until
recently
said
it
could
best
serve
norwegian
investors
and
companies
by
remaining
independent
but
following
euronext
s
bid
last
month
the
exchange
quickly
looked
for
an
alternative
buyer
nasdaq
called
on
euronext
to
withdraw
its
offer
and
told
shareholders
to
let
their
promises
to
euronext
expire
two
hints
euronext
can
change
their
minds
rosendahl
told
reuters
and
the
shareholder
undertakings
have
an
expiry
date
in
august
this
year
if
they
are
not
executed
