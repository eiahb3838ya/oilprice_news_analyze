reuters
the
united
states
imposed
heavy
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
oil
industry
on
monday
looking
to
cut
off
president
nicolas
maduro
s
primary
source
of
revenue
the
sanctions
limit
transactions
between
companies
that
do
business
with
venezuela
through
purchases
of
crude
oil
and
sales
of
refined
products
however
there
are
currently
numerous
unanswered
questions
about
the
sanctions
the
united
states
is
aiming
to
freeze
sale
proceeds
from
venezuelan
oil
firm
pdvsa
s
exports
of
roughly
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
to
the
united
states
there
is
also
a
prohibition
on
firms
exporting
diluents
unfinished
oils
used
for
blending
extra
heavy
crude
to
venezuela
venezuela
exports
oil
primarily
to
the
united
states
india
and
china
as
well
as
some
other
nations
only
the
united
states
and
india
are
notable
sources
of
cash
as
russian
and
chinese
firms
currently
get
shipments
of
crude
through
complicated
agreements
due
to
venezuela
s
heavy
liabilities
with
those
countries
the
treasury
department
s
sanctions
do
not
entirely
cut
off
purchases
of
venezuelan
oil
by
refineries
however
they
stipulate
that
refiners
can
not
make
payments
directly
to
pdvsa
but
into
escrow
accounts
that
pdvsa
will
not
be
able
to
access
until
the
company
is
controlled
by
a
new
government
maduro
and
manuel
quevedo
who
is
both
oil
minister
and
head
of
pdvsa
have
said
that
they
will
not
allow
vessels
loaded
with
crude
oil
for
the
united
states
to
leave
the
country
s
ports
without
being
prepaid
pdvsa
on
tuesday
said
it
was
considering
declaring
force
majeure
on
cargoes
bound
for
the
united
states
for
now
companies
can
do
business
but
with
restrictions
refineries
that
import
from
venezuela
can
continue
to
receive
shipments
for
the
next
few
months
before
they
are
forced
to
shift
their
supply
sources
elsewhere
however
since
payments
can
not
be
made
to
pdvsa
this
is
expected
to
restrict
the
flow
of
crude
oil
from
venezuela
to
the
united
states
the
sanctions
did
not
directly
mention
swaps
and
indirect
trade
with
pdvsa
that
began
in
recent
years
with
customers
including
pdvsa
s
unit
citgo
petroleum
india
s
reliance
and
russia
s
rosneft
chevron
corp
halliburton
schlumberger
baker
hughes
and
weatherford
international
all
have
operations
in
venezuela
and
are
allowed
to
continue
to
engage
in
transactions
and
activities
with
pdvsa
and
its
joint
ventures
through
july
this
could
cause
venezuela
s
production
to
fall
further
later
this
year
if
service
companies
which
have
already
reduced
operations
finally
leave
the
country
chevron
has
four
operations
in
the
country

said
it
would
not
comment
on
the
current
situation
in

the
