ahead

from

confidence
that

took
a

the

was
percent
higher
by

following

investors
pondered
the
possibility
of
a
british
departure
from
the
european
union
after
uk
lawmakers
instructed
prime
minister
theresa
may
on
tuesday
to
reopen
the
treaty
she
had
negotiated
with
brussels
to
replace
a
divisive
irish
border
arrangement
while
a
no
deal
scenario
is
still
unlikely
these
developments
increase
the
risk
of
accidentally
leaving
the
eu
without
a
deal
and
plans
may
intensify
from
both
sides
to
manage
that
outcome

an
eu
source
said
earlier
apple
results
provided
some
reassurance
as
the
iphone
maker
reported
sharp
growth
in
its
services
business
investors
were
relieved
that
there
was
no
more
bad
news
after
the
company
shocked
financial
markets
at
the
start
of
this
month
with
a
revenue
warning
that
triggered
fears
that
trade
tensions
were
taking
a
toll
on
the
tech
sector
apple
earnings
delivered
enough
for
investors
to
come
back
on
board
said
analyst
neil
wilson
although
apple
still
faces
big
questions
like
pricing
structure
upgrade
cycles
fx
headwinds
and
weaker
chinese
demand
we
did
get
a
positive
answer
to
the
key
question
on
whether
services
margins

apple
ceo
tim
cook
said
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
china
were
easing
lifting
the
mood
before
another
round
of
official
talks
on
wednesday
in
washington
the
two
sides
will
meet
next
door
to
the
white
house
in
the
talks
since
president
donald
trump
and
his
chinese
counterpart
xi
jinping
agreed
a
truce
in
their
trade
war
in
december
i
expect
that
the
washington
summit
will
help
pave
the
way
for
an
extension
of
the
trade
truce
this
is
also
what
markets
expect
and
a
failure
of
the
talks
is
not
priced
in
at
all

expectations
from
wednesday
s
federal
reserve
rates
review
are
that
policymakers
will
reinforce
their
recent
dovish
stance
given
signs
of
a
slowdown
in
the
economy
we
believe
the
fed
is
likely
to
show
the
flexibility
markets
are
seeking
at
its
upcoming
meeting
as
it
balances
still
solid
domestic
economic
growth
against
slower
global
growth
