venezuela
s
oil
inventories
have
started
to
build
up
at
the
country
s
ports
and
terminals
as
pdvsa
is
finding
it
can
not
export
crude
at
its
usual
rate
due
to
sanctions
imposed
earlier
this
week
according
to
sources
and
shipping
data
sanctions
announced
on
monday
by
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
aimed
at
driving
president
nicolas
maduro
out
of
power
after
his
contested
last
year
have
barred
pdvsa
s
customers
from
transferring
payments
to
the
firm
that
is
effectively
limiting
pdvsa
from
shipping
that
oil
because
maduro
s
government
can
not
collect
the
proceeds
as
of
wednesday
venezuela
had
tankers
with
nearly
million
barrels
of
crude
representing
about
two
weeks
of
the
country
s
production
either
waiting
to
load
or
expecting
authorization
to
set
sail
most
of
those
were
anchored
near
the
port
of
jose
the
country
s
largest
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
data
pdvsa
responded
to
the
sanctions
by
prohibiting
tankers
loading
oil
bound
for
the
united
states
to
leave
venezuelan
ports
if
cargoes
are
not
prepaid
in
addition
pdvsa
s
inability
to
pay
for
crucial
imports
means
fuel
imports
are
delayed
adding
to
the
glut
of
tankers
off
venezuela
s
coast
we
are
facing
problems
to
continue
storing
merey
crude
a
pdvsa
source
said
referring
to
the
most
common
crude
grade
it
exports
most
cargoes
were
bound
for
customers
including
pdvsa
s
refining
unit
citgo
petroleum
chevron
corp
valero
energy
and
pbf
energy
other
large
vessels
loaded
with
venezuelan
oil
and
fuel
were
waiting
to
depart
for
singapore
india
and
china
pdvsa
exported
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
last
year
including
bpd
to
the
united
states
the
company
boosted
sales
in
early
january
in
anticipation
of
sanctions
according
to
the
refinitiv
eikon
data
wills
rangel
a
pdvsa
board
member
on
wednesday
told
reuters
the
company
which
is
currently
producing
million
bpd
of
crude
does
not
plan
to
cancel
supply
contracts
with
clients
that
comes
even
though
pdvsa
president
manuel
quevedo
on
tuesday
said
a
declaration
of
force
majeure
that
would
free
pdvsa
from
paying
penalties
for
undelivered
cargoes
was
under
consideration
meanwhile
pdvsa
is
eying
exports
to
other
destinations
an
instruction
was
given
to
define
new
export
markets
in
to
days
rangel
said
the
company
is
looking
to
india
for
more
imports
and
is
also
considering
imports
of
light
crude
if
necessary
to
boost
domestic
production
of
gasoline
washington
s
measures
against
the
socialist
maduro
who
has
overseen
the
country
s
economic
collapse
and
an
exodus
of
millions
of
venezuelans
in
recent
years
aim
to
back
a
new
government
formed
by
the
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
pdvsa
is
facing
problems
unloading
fuel
imports
for
domestic
use
because
sanctions
are
making
it
difficult
to
complete
payments
for
deliveries
according
to
rangel
who
also
leads
the
firm
s
labor
union
sanctions
require
pdvsa
s
customers
including
its
refining
arm
citgo
petroleum
to
deposit
proceeds
from
imports
of
venezuelan
oil
in
special
accounts
out
of
maduro
s
reach
they
also
limit
dollar
transactions
with
pdvsa
but
do
not
specify
if
fuel
can
still
be
exported
to
venezuela
even
being
here
and
having
secured
the
money
shippers
in
some
cases
have
intended
to
block
tankers
from
discharging
said
rangel
pdvsa
will
insist
the
fuel
cargoes
are
discharged
and
try
to
find
a
way
to
pay
for
them
according
to
rangel
he
did
not
elaborate
on
how
the
company
would
convince
suppliers
and
shipping
firms
hired
to
transport
the
cargoes
to
accept
payments
and
discharge
shipments
under
pdvsa
s
terms
venezuela
s
main
fuel
providers
are
citgo
and
india
s
reliance
industries
ltd
which
typically
ships
naphtha
alkylate
for
gasoline
diesel
and
components
from
the
united
states
according
to
internal
pdvsa
trade
documents
pdvsa
has
fuel
inventories
at
its
terminals
sufficient
to
cover
a
month
of
domestic
venezuelan
consumption
according
to
rangel
s
numbers
as
its
main
refining
complex
the
paraguana
refining
center
is
working
at
percent
of
its
capacity
but
sources
at
pdvsa
estimate
stocks
at
closer
to
days
of
consumption
with
little
finished
gasoline
or
diesel
as
of
wednesday
over
tankers
were
anchored
near
pdvsa
s
ports
waiting
to
discharge
some
million
barrels
of
imported
diesel
gasoline
vacuum
gasoil
liquefied
petroleum
gas
and
naphtha
enough
for
an
estimated
days
of
consumption
that
would
give
pdvsa
more
leeway
to
supply
gas
stations
and
power
plants
if
tankers
are
finally
discharged
