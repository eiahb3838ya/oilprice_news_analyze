south
african
miners
support
a
restructuring
of
struggling
state
power
firm
eskom
to
boost
competition
in
the
electricity
supply
industry
an
industry
body
said
on
wednesday
warning
that
tariff
hikes
alone
would
not
solve
eskom
s
problems
top
government
officials
will
discuss
whether
to
split
eskom
into
generation
transmission
and
distribution
units
at
a
cabinet
meeting
starting
on
wednesday
as
part
of
efforts
to
rescue
the
company
from
financial
crisis
the
mining
and
smelting
industry
is
one
of
eskom
s
top
customers
accounting
for
around
percent
of
electricity
demand
in
africa
s
most
industrialised
economy
most
countries
we
compete
against
have
electricity
supply
industries
where
generation
is
competitive
there
is
a
state
transmission
company
and
some
competition
in
distribution
roger
baxter
chief
executive
of
south
africa
s
minerals
council
an
industry
lobby
group
said
we
need
eskom
to
be
made
into
a
much
more
efficient
the
minerals
council
which
represents
firms
including
and
exxaro
says
average
annual
power
price
increases
of
percent
between
and
reduced
investment
in
the
mining
sector
by
a
cumulative
billion
rand
billion
it
says
eskom
s
request
for
a
further
percent
increase
in
electricity
tariffs
in
each
of
the
next
three
years
if
granted
by
the
country
s
energy
regulator
nersa
would
cripple
an
industry
already
in
decline
more
than
percent
of
gold
production
would
become
marginal
or
with
around
percent
of
platinum
group
metals
production
marginal
or
unprofitable
by
the
end
of
the
period
baxter
said
thousands
of
mining
jobs
could
be
lost
he
added
eskom
has
argued
that
its
tariff
hike
request
to
nersa
could
help
shore
up
its
finances
deon
joubert
eskom
s
corporate
specialist
for
finance
told
consumers
at
a
public
hearing
on
the
proposed
hikes
on
monday
that
the
utility
s
debt
had
increased
as
its
tariffs
had
failed
to
keep
pace
with
its
spending
on
new
power
stations
eskom
is
cognisant
of
the
potential
impact
of
the
increase
in
various
sectors
but
it
finds
itself
in
a
very
difficult
financial
position
joubert
said
public
enterprises
minister
pravin
gordhan
who
oversees
eskom
said
on
tuesday
that
south
africa
needed
to
act
fast
on
eskom
because
of
the
extent
of
its
financial
difficulties
eskom
supplies
more
than
percent
of
south
africa
s
power
but
is
drowning
in
more
than
billion
rand
of
debt
after
a
decade
of
steep
financial
decline
