potential

said

declining
domestic
output
amidst
growing
energy
demand
would
leave
lng
as
a
mainstay
in
its
energy
mix
he
said
coal
s
share
will
rise
in
the
nation
s
energy
mix
but
existing
gas
infrastructure
and
growing
environmental
and
land
acquisition
concerns
surrounding
large
coal
plants
would
mean
that
coal
s
share
will
not
grow
in
such
a
scenario
with
lng
expected
to
be
a
long
term
solution
a
terminal
with
larger
capacity
would
be
more
economical
than
a
smaller
fsru
which
is
typically
best
suited
to
meet
and
demand
