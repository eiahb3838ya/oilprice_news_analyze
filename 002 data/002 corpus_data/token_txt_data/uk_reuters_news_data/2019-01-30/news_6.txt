abubakar

been
key
issues

a

nigerian
state
coffers
have
in

been
ransacked
by
government
officials
and
their
associates
and
corruption
is
prevalent

elected
in
in
part
on
a
promise
to
rid
the
country
of
graft

west
african
nation
launched
a
whistleblower
scheme
two
years
ago
entitling
those
who
help
find
stolen
assets
to
up
to
percent
of
the
recovered
sums
part
of
a
drive
by
buhari
to
root
out
endemic

voluntarily
return
some
of
the
stolen
funds
badly
needed
to
fund
infrastructure

they
owned
shares
in
while
in
public
office
both
candidates
denied

he
also
said
he
would
be
more
than
willing

the
military
faces
shortages
of
