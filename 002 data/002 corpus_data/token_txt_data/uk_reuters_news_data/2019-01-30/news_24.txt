cape
town
reuters
rescuers
are
moving
hundreds
of
dehydrated
lesser
flamingo
chicks
from
their
breeding
ground
at
a
south
african
dam
to
a
bird
sanctuary
in
cape
town
to
save
them
from
death
by
starvation
and
lack
of
water
their
birthplace
kamfers
dam
in
the
northern
cape
is
one
of
only
three
breeding
grounds
for
the
famously
pink
birds
in
southern
africa
the
other
two
being
in
namibia
and
botswana
according
to
researcher
katta
ludynia
the
rescued
chicks
take
three
to
four
months
to
fledge
and
it
is
not
yet
clear
whether
they
will
eventually
be
released
back
into
the
wild
in
cape
town
or
transported
back
hundreds
of
km
miles
to
their
home
in
kimberley
she
said
there
are
still
several
thousand
birds
breeding
in
the
dam
in
areas
that
still
have
water
said
katta
ludynia
research
manager
at
the
southern
african
foundation
for
the
conservation
of
coastal
birds
sanccob
it
now
depends
on
the
water
levels
whether
these
birds
will
pull
ludynia
said
the
sanctuary
was
caring
for
around
chicks
most
of
them
dehydrated
when
they
first
arrived
on
monday
after
being
abandoned
by
parents
who
went
off
in
search
of
food
the
chicks
are
being
moved
to
the
sanctuary
by
plane
and
road
sanccob
is
one
of
several
centres
across
south
africa
caring
for
around
chicks
that
were
rescued
from
the
dam
although
it
hosts
the
biggest
population
of
lesser
flamingoes
in
southern
africa
kamfers
dam
situated
to
the
north
of
kimberley
is
often
dry
and
depends
mainly
on
rain
water
it
also
gets
some
water
from
a
sewerage
works
that
releases
water
into
its
wetlands
the
dam
in
kimberley
is
so
important
because
it
is
manageable
so
we
can
secure
the
water
level
there
and
that
might
be
the
only
site
the
flamingoes
can
breed
in
southern
africa
if
the
drought
continues
in
other
areas
