update 1-oink, moo and brrr: polar vortex strikes u.s. farm belt
chicago
reuters
farmers
from
north
dakota
to
iowa
buckled
down
for
some
of
the
coldest
weather
in
a
generation
on
wednesday
throwing
extra
rations
to
pigs
or
building
igloos
for
chickens
in
the
teeth
of
temperatures
and
winds
some
like
kurt
line
in
indiana
joked
about
the
forecast
line
said
he
was
working
on
his
tax
returns
something
he
usually
puts
off
rather
than
braving
the
cold
to
load
corn
for
a
local
processing
plant
but
temperatures
expected
to
plunge
in
some
areas
as
low
as
minus
degrees
the
point
at
which
fahrenheit
and
celsius
converge
are
no
laughing
matter
for
an
industry
dependent
on
the
elements
cargill
inc
closed
all
its
grain
plants
in
the
midwest
on
wednesday
because
of
extreme
cold
and
will
likely
reopen
them
on
thursday
after
temperatures
warm
company
spokeswoman
april
nelson
said
tyson
foods
inc
canceled
two
shifts
at
a
pork
plant
in
waterloo
iowa
while
hormel
foods
corp
halted
the
hog
slaughter
at
its
processor
in
austin
minnesota
according
to
three
people
familiar
with
the
operations
the
companies
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
on
the
closures
the
brutal
chill
was
caused
by
the
polar
vortex
a
mass
of
freezing
air
that
normally
spins
around
the
north
pole
but
has
made
its
way
south
to
the
united
states
minnesota
farmer
peter
bakken
woke
on
wednesday
to
three
of
his
family
s
cattle
water
fountains
frozen
he
spent
the
day
spraying
hot
water
to
thaw
the
pipes
and
keeping
a
close
eye
on
the
weather
forecast
the
family
grows
alfalfa
and
snow
cover
on
the
plants
is
insulating
them
from
the
bitter
cold
but
the
weather
is
expected
to
warm
this
weekend
and
then
get
cold
again
he
said
that
could
replace
the
snow
cover
with
ice
which
could
kill
the
plants
cattle
ranchers
joey
myers
and
her
fianc√©
scott
bailey
in
minot
north
dakota
were
brewing
even
more
coffee
after
staying
up
all
night
for
a
second
night
in
a
row
to
check
on
their
animals
they
feared
the
minus
f
minus
temperatures
with
wind
chills
of
minus
degrees
f
minus
c
could
cause
their
pregnant
cows
to
give
birth
early
their
heated
barn
is
not
big
enough
to
house
every
animal
so
they
must
keep
watch
for
newborn
calves
to
prevent
fatalities
ron
prestage
president
of
one
of
iowa
s
biggest
hog
producers
prestage
farms
said
his
company
had
been
stocking
up
on
feed
to
last
at
least
until
friday
and
was
making
sure
heaters
and
water
lines
were
running
at
hog
barns
as
cold
as
it
s
going
to
be
water
lines
are
a
critical
factor
he
said
most
crops
are
planted
in
the
spring
but
the
winter
wheat
crop
sown
in
some
areas
could
be
at
risk
if
the
cold
continues
the
freeze
was
also
a
concern
for
the
smallest
of
farmers
backyard
chicken
owners
in
the
midwest
flocked
online
for
advice
on
how
to
protect
their
birds
with
some
on
the
chat
forum
at
asking
if
they
should
add
a
heating
pad
for
their
poultry
to
stand
on
others
suggested
putting
extra
tarps
around
the
coops
to
keep
chickens
dry
and
coating
exposed
chicken
skin
with
petroleum
jelly
to
ward
off
frostbite
in
chicago
