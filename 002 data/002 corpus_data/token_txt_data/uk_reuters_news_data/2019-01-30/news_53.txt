oink, moo and brrr: polar vortex strikes u.s. farm belt
chicago
jan

farmers
from
north
dakota
to
iowa
buckled
down
for
some
of
the
coldest
weather
in
a
generation
on
wednesday
throwing
extra
rations
to
pigs
or
building
igloos
for
chickens
before
hunkering
down
for
a
day
of
temperatures
and
winds
some
like
kurt
line
in
indiana
joked
about
the
forecast
line
said
he
looked
forward
to
working
on
his
tax
returns
something
he
usually
puts
off
rather
than
braving
the
cold
to
load
corn
for
a
local
processing
plant
but
temperatures
expected
to
plunge
in
some
areas
as
low
as
minus
degrees
the
point
at
which
fahrenheit
and
celsius
converge
are
no
laughing
matter
for
an
industry
dependent
on
the
elements
the
brutal
chill
was
caused
by
the
polar
vortex
a
mass
of
freezing
air
that
normally
spins
around
the
north
pole
but
has
made
its
way
south
to
the
united
states
cattle
ranchers
joey
myers
and
her
fianc√©
scott
bailey
in
minot
north
dakota
were
brewing
coffee
with
plans
to
stay
up
all
night
as
long
as
the
cold
lasted
to
check
on
their
animals
we
ll
be
doing
the
same
tonight
tomorrow
night
and
the
night
after
that
said
myers
who
added
the
couple
were
breaking
out
their
ski
masks
and
ski
goggles
to
protect
their
faces
from
the
cold
they
feared
the
minus
f
minus
temperatures
with
wind
chills
of
minus
degrees
f
minus
c
could
cause
their
pregnant
cows
to
give
birth
early
their
heated
barn
is
not
big
enough
to
house
every
animal
so
they
must
keep
watch
for
newborn
calves
to
prevent
fatalities
ron
prestage
president
of
one
of
iowa
s
biggest
hog
producers
prestage
farms
said
his
company
had
been
stocking
up
on
feed
to
last
at
least
until
friday
and
was
making
sure
heaters
and
water
lines
were
running
at
hog
barns
when
it
gets
cold
they
eat
more
he
said
in
a
phone
interview
so
we
just
have
to
make
sure
we
plan
as
cold
as
it
s
going
to
be
water
lines
are
a
critical
factor
he
added
also
in
iowa
deanna
brennecke
said
she
knew
the
cold
was
coming
days
before
the
local
tv
weather
reports
her
cattle
had
been
eating
far
more
feed
and
putting
on
weight
to
help
keep
themselves
warm
as
the
temperatures
plummeted
they
were
meeting
us
at
the
gate
and
filling
themselves
full
and
we
just
knew
said
brennecke
who
runs
her
family
s
farm
and
raises
goats
with
her
husband
in
decatur
county
the
cold
weather

for

others

tarps
around
the
