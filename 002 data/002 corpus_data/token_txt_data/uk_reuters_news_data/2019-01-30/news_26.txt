vienna
reuters
the
nuclear
watchdog
policing
iran
s
deal
with
major
powers
said
on
wednesday
that
attempts
to
pressure
it
on
inspections
were
and
extremely
harmful
though
it
stopped
short
of
naming
those
responsible
israel
which
vehemently
opposes
the
iran
nuclear
deal
has
called
on
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
to
visit
what
it
says
is
a
secret
atomic
warehouse
and
other
locations
in
iran
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
who
has
pulled
his
country
out
of
the
deal
has
made
similar
calls
the
iaea
has
bristled
at
such
calls
but
used
only
guarded
language
in
public
saying
it
does
not
take
information
at
face
value
and
assesses
it
independently
and
then
only
sends
inspectors
to
a
specific
location
when
necessary
in
a
speech
to
staff
on
wednesday
however
iaea
chief
yukiya
amano
was
blunt
if
our
credibility
is
thrown
into
question
and
in
particular
if
attempts
are
made
to
or
put
pressure
on
the
agency
in
nuclear
verification
that
is
and
extremely
harmful
he
said
according
to
a
text
of
the
speech
posted
online
by
the
iaea
he
did
not
elaborate
on
the
attempts
or
those
behind
them
the
iaea
is
policing
the
restrictions
placed
on
iran
s
nuclear
activities
under
the
deal
which
also
lifted
international
sanctions
against
tehran
amano
reiterated
that
iran
was
continuing
to
keep
its
end
of
the
bargain
trump
on
wednesday
called
top
intelligence
chiefs
extremely
passive
and
naive
on
iran
a
day
after
they
contradicted
his
views
in
congressional
testimony
amano
was
also
more
direct
in
making
the
case
for
his
agency
to
be
in
charge
of
inspections
in
north
korea
in
the
event
of
any
political
agreement
being
reached
on
that
country
s
nuclear
activities
trump
and
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
are
due
to
hold
their
second
summit
in
late
february
the
iaea
is
the
only
international
organisation
that
can
verify
the
nuclear
programme
of
the
dprk
said
amano
using
the
acronym
of
the
country
s
official
name
the
democratic
people
s
republic
of
korea
amano
a
japanese
diplomat
has
previously
said
his
agency
is
best
placed
to
do
that
job
it
has
not
been
granted
access
to
north
korea
since
when
pyongyang
threw
out
its
inspectors
as
far
as
the
nuclear
programme
of
the
dprk
is
concerned
we
remain
ready
to
play
an
essential
verification
role
if
a
political
agreement
is
reached
among
countries
concerned
