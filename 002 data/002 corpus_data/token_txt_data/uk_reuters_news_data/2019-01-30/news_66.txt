the
fight
for
control
of
venezuela
intensified
on
wednesday
as
the
government
pushed
a
probe
that
may
lead
to
the
arrest
of
opposition
leader
and
interim
president
juan
guaido
who
called
for
new
street
protests
venezuela
s
supreme
court
imposed
a
travel
ban
on
guaido
and
froze
his
bank
accounts
in
apparent
retaliation
for
oil
sanctions
imposed
by
the
united
states
that
are
expected
to
severely
hit
the
opec
member
s
already
collapsing
economy
guaido
is
recognized
as
president
by
the
united
states
and
most
western
hemisphere
nations
presenting
the
biggest
challenge
to
president
nicolas
maduro
s
rule
the
opposition
lawmaker
who
is
president
of
the
national
assembly
wants
new
elections
arguing
that
maduro
fraudulently
won
a
second
term
last
year
guaido
is
offering
an
amnesty
to
tempt
military
officials
to
join
him
maduro
who
accuses
guaido
of
staging
a
coup
against
him
still
has
the
support
of
the
top
military
brass
and
is
unlikely
to
back
down
unless
that
changes
russia
and
china
are
also
key
benefactors
giving
him
backing
at
the
security
council
on
wednesday
maduro
rejected
calls
for
a
snap
presidential
election
as
blackmail
and
reiterated
he
was
ready
for
talks
with
the
opposition
and
possible
third
country
mediation
russia
s
ria
news
agency
reported
there
are
several
governments
organizations
globally
which
are
demonstrating
their
sincere
concern
about
what
is
happening
in
venezuela
they
have
called
for
a
dialogue
ria
quoted
maduro
as
saying
given
the
failure
of
previous
rounds
of
dialogue
including
one
led
by
the
vatican
opponents
are
suspicious
believing
maduro
uses
them
to
quell
protests
and
buy
time
with
the
venezuela
crisis
deepening
a
geopolitical
showdown
between
washington
and
moscow
across
various
global
flashpoints
maduro
also
expressed
pleasure
and
gratitude
for
putin
s
help
russia
has
loaned
and
invested
billions
of
dollars
in
venezuela

maduro
has
overseen
a
shrinking
economy
and
the
migration
of
more
than
million
venezuelans
fleeing
food
and
drug
shortages
and
hyperinflation
guaido
called
for
more
protests
on
wednesday
and
a
mass
march
at
the
weekend
to
keep
up
pressure
on
maduro
in
the
streets
wednesday
s
action
would
not
be
a
major
march
but
a
series
of
small
concentrations
he
said
more
than
people
have
died
so
far
in
and
around
the
protests
that
began
a
week
ago
the
human
rights
office
said
hundreds
have
also
been
arrested
including
children
government
supporters
have
also
attended
large
rallies
led
by
maduro
allies
while
the
president
visited
military
bases
including
overseeing
exercises
in
recent
days
he
ordered
the
creation
of
popular
defense
units
community
groups
he
said
would
be
charged
with
the
integral
defense
of
the
while
it
was
not
clear
if
they
would
be
armed
the
strategy
reflects
government
concern
the
united
states
could
try
to
defeat
maduro
militarily
the
pentagon
has
refused
to
rule
out
military
action
although

it
not

his
cronies

also
likely
to
hit
daily
life
hard
in
venezuela
where
public
spending
is
almost
entirely
funded
by
oil
revenues
the
government
is
eager
to
blame
guaido
for
the
measures
which
once
they
begin
to
bite
could
diminish
his
popularity
