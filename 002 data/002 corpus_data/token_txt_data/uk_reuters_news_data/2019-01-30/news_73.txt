the
struggle
for
control
of
venezuela
intensified
on
wednesday
as
the
government
prepared
an
investigation
that
could
lead
to
the
arrest
of
opposition
leader
and
interim
president
juan
guaido
who
has
called
for
new
street
protests
venezuela
s
supreme
court
imposed
a
travel
ban
on
guaido
and
froze
his
bank
accounts
in
apparent
retaliation
for
oil
sanctions
imposed
by
the
united
states
that
are
expected
to
severely
damage
the
opec
member
s
already
collapsing
economy
guaido
is
recognized
as
president
by
the
united
states
and
most
countries
in
the
western
hemisphere
presenting
the
biggest
challenge
to
president
nicolas
maduro
since
he
took
office
six
years
ago
the
opposition
lawmaker
who
is
president
of
the
national
assembly
has
called
for
clean
elections
arguing
that
maduro
fraudulently
won
a
second
term
last
year
guaido
is
offering
an
amnesty
to
tempt
military
officials
to
join
him
maduro
who
accuses
guaido
of
staging
a
coup
against
him
counts
on
the
support
of
the
military
and
is
unlikely
to
back
down
unless
that
changes
russia
and
china
are
also
key
benefactors
giving
him
diplomatic
backing
at
the
security
council
a
former
union
leader
who
succeeded
his
charismatic
mentor
the
late
president
hugo
chavez
maduro
has
overseen
a
shrinking
economy
and
the
migration
of
more
than
million
venezuelans
fleeing
food
and
drug
shortages
and
hyperinflation
guaido
called
for
more
protests
on
wednesday
and
a
mass
march
on
the
weekend
in
a
bid
to
keep
up
pressure
on
maduro
in
the
streets
wednesday
s
action
would
not
be
a
major
march
but
a
series
of
small
concentrations
guaido
said
the
human
rights
office
said
the
protests
had
so
far
led
to
the
deaths
of
more
than
people
government
supporters
have
also
attended
large
rallies
led
by
maduro
s
political
allies
while
the
president
visited
military
bases
including
overseeing
exercises
in
recent
days
he
ordered
the
creation
of
popular
defense
units
community
groups
he
said
would
be
charged
with
the
integral
defense
of
the
while
it
was
not
clear
if
they
would
be
armed
the
strategy
reflects
the
government
s
concern
the
united
states
could
try
to
defeat
maduro
militarily
the
pentagon
has
refused
to
rule
out
military
action
although
is
it
not
considered
likely
by
most
experts
trump
s
top
advisers

cold
hawks
white

national
security

john
bolton

such
speculation

expected
to
hit

life
hard
in

where

spending
is
almost
entirely
funded
by

revenues
the
government
is
eager
to
blame
guaido
for
the
measures
which
once
they
begin
to
bite
could
diminish
his
popularity
