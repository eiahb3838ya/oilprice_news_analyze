caracas
reuters
venezuela
s
government
struck
back
at
interim
president
juan
guaido
on
tuesday
with
the
supreme
court
imposing
a
travel
ban
and
freeze
on
his
bank
accounts
despite
a
warning
from
washington
of
serious
consequences
if
it
did
so
the
court
also
said
prosecutors
could
investigate
guaido
in
apparent
retaliation
for
sweeping
sanctions
on
oil
firm
pdvsa
announced
on
monday
the
sanctions
mean
the
company
may
not
be
able
to
fulfil
contracts
with
north
american
buyers
the
government
of
president
nicolas
maduro
said
aimed
at
driving
maduro
from
power
the
sanctions
were
the
strongest
measures
yet
against
the
former
union
leader
who
has
overseen
economic
collapse
and
an
exodus
of
millions
of
venezuelans
in
recent
years
the
measures
triggered
higher
global
oil
prices
angry
responses
from
china
and
russia
and
the
first
serious
moves
against
guaido
since
he
challenged
maduro
s
claim
on
the
presidency
last
week
the
supreme
court
approved
a
request
from
venezuelan
attorney
general
tarek
saab
to
open
a
preliminary
investigation
into
guaido
based
on
accusations
he
helped
foreign
countries
to
interfere
in
internal
matters
the
court
also
imposed
a
travel
ban
on
the
leader
and
froze
his
bank
accounts
as
a
lawmaker
who
heads
the
national
assembly
guaido
has
immunity
from
prosecution
unless
ordered
by
a
top
court
but
the
supreme
court
is
loyal
to
maduro
and
moved
quickly
to
open
the
investigation
in
response
to
news
earlier
of
the
attorney
general
s
plan
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
warned
of
serious
consequences
for
those
who
attempt
to
subvert
democracy
and
harm
guaido
in
a
tweet
that
described
saab
as
the
illegitimate
former
venezuelan
attorney
the
united
states
and
several
other
countries
have
recognised
guaido
as
venezuela
s
legitimate
head
of
state
and
denounced
maduro
as
a
usurper
maduro
sworn
in
on
for
a
second
term
after
disputed
elections
last
year
accuses
guaido
of
staging
a
coup
against
him
maduro
is
backed
by
a
number
of
countries
including
russia
maduro
s
inauguration
sparked
protests
throughout
venezuela
over
people

believed
to
have
been
killed
in
political
violence
last
week
including
shot
by
forces
five
killed

house
raids
and
during
looting
human
rights

rupert
colville
said
on
tuesday
he
said
more
than
people
were
detained
between
and
including
children
some
as
young
as
guaido
said
on
tuesday
he
did
not
underestimate
the
threat
of
imprisonment
but
did
not
believe
it
was
anything
many
opposition
leaders
have
been
imprisoned
in
the
south
american
nation
we
are
here
we
will
keep
acting
and
working
to
confront
the
humanitarian
crisis
guaido
told
a
news
conference
most
experts
believe
the
sanctions
and
other
measures
against
maduro
will
encourage
him
to
step
down
only
if
he
loses
the
support
of
the
powerful
military
which
until
now
has
been
mostly
loyal
to
the
leftist
ruling
party
founded
by
late
president
hugo
chavez
maduro
appeared
on
a
television
broadcast
from
a

on

it
had
certified
guaido
s
authority
to
control
certain
assets
held
by
banks
including
government
and
central
bank
accounts
military
invention
is
seen
in
washington
as
highly
unlikely
but
president
donald
trump
has
repeatedly
said
all
options
are
on
the
table

he
said
we
can
t
allow
venezuelan

he
said
in
a
speech

pdvsa
is
also
seeking
to
sidestep
the
sanctions
by
asking
major
buyers
including
refiners
to
renegotiate
contracts
sources
said
international
brent
crude
oil
futures
rose
over
percent
on
tuesday
in
reaction
venezuela
is
among
the
world
s
largest
heavy
crude
oil
producers
the
kremlin
condemned
the
sanctions
as
illegal
interference
while
china
said
they
would
lead
to
suffering
for
which
washington
would
bear
responsibility
the
sanctions
could
cause
problems
for
venezuela
when
it
comes
to
servicing
its
sovereign
debt
to
russia
which
stands
at
billion
russian
deputy
finance
minister

on
tuesday
in
geneva
senior
and
venezuelan
diplomats
traded
jibes
at
a
disarmament
conference
venezuela
s
ambassador
jorge
valero
said
the
trump
administration
was
preparing
a
military
invasion
and
questioned
whether
washington
had
the
moral
authority
to
impose
a
diktat
on
caracas
venezuela
has
sunk
into
economic
and
political
turmoil
under
maduro
s
socialist
government
with
inflation
seen
rising
to
million
percent
this
year
the
loss
of
revenue
from
the
united
states
the
no
buyer
of
venezuelan
crude
is
sure
to
further
hamper
the
government
s
ability
to
import
basic
goods
like
food
and
medicine
exacerbating
a
humanitarian
crisis
that
has
prompted
more
than
million
