will
give

to
the
poor
people

headed
into
a
labyrinth
of
alleyways
in
mosul
s
ancient
old
city
to
knock
on
doors
and
hand
over
packets
of
fresh
beef
many
of

narrow
streets

nine
months

urban
warfare
the
remains
of
some
walls
look
like
they
are
about
to
collapse
decayed
body
parts
can
still
be
seen
and
smelled
amidst
the
debris
where
the
most
severe
fighting
raged
west
of

experts
say
rebuilding
mosul
alone
which
had
a
population
of
million
and
now
has
homeless
is
expected
to
cost
billions
of
dollars
low
budgets

a
major
challenge

august
hazem
mohammed
and
his
family
returned
to
a
heap
of
debris
that
used
to
be
his
home
next
to
a
heavily
damaged
former
football
field
a
few
minutes
walk
from
deserted
ruins
still
reeking
of
unrecovered
human
remains
mohammed
settled
down
in
a
tent
pitched
outside
his
old
house
affording
his
family
a
little
shade
in
the
celsius
summer
heat
on
thursday
his
wife
boiled
water
on
an
open
fire
outside
the
tent
with
small
children
playing
inside
i
decided
to
live
with
my
family
in
this
tent
to
encourage
the
iraqi
government
and
humanitarian
organizations
to
rebuild
my
house
and
other
destroyed
houses
in
the
old
city
he
said
we
are
a
poor
family
we
don
t
have
money
to
live
in
dignity
we
suffer
from
lack
of
food
and
we
don
t
have
enough
furniture
because
it
is
under
the
ruins
of
our
house
a
passing
car
stopped
at
the
tent
and
the
driver
who
gave
his
name
as
mohammed
saleh
handed
out
a
bag
of
eid
meat
i
m
afraid
that
the
government
s
failure
to
rebuild
infrastructure
could
bring
a
return
of
extremism
saleh
said
mosul
municipal
officials
and
western
donors
are
concerned
that
the
slowness
of
reconstruction
might
rekindle
ite
sectarian
grievances
that
islamic
state
exploited
even
a
walk
through
an
upscale
district
of
eastern
mosul
which
escaped
the
worst
fighting
and
where
life
has
largely
returned
to
bustling
normality
can
be
dangerous
an
explosion
on
tuesday
night
in
the
hay
neighbourhood
injured
no
one
but
left
a
roadside
crater
next
to
what
residents
said
was
the
makeshift
grave
of
an
is
militant
killed
in
battle
the
blast
might
have
been
an
old
grenade
or
part
of
the
militant

suicide
