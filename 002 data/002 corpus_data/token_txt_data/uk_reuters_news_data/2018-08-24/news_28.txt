commission
recommended
on
friday
contradicting
earlier
advice
from
the
central
bank
and
boosting
the
shares
of
oil
firms
a
decision
on
whether
to
drop
energy
shares
from
the
fund
s
benchmark
index
and
thus
divest
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
from
oil
and
gas
stocks
over
time
is
expected
this
autumn
shares
of
european
oil
and
gas
companies
fell
last
november
when
the
fund
s
manager
the
norwegian
central
bank
announced
its
proposal
to
cut
the
exposure
of
the
fund
and
thus
the
norwegian
government
to
oil
price
fluctuations
on
friday
shares
of
european
oil
firms
including
shell
and
bp
rose
on
the
news
of
the
commission
s
advice
to
get
that
small
insurance
against
the
fluctuation
of
the
oil
price
by
removing
energy
stocks
it
would
cost
the
fund
a
lot
as
it
would
be
less

second
you
would
change
an
institution
that
has
worked
very
well
and
third
as
the
years
go
by
we
have
less
and
less
oil
risk
he
said
referring
to
norway
s
declining
oil
reserves
the

the

largest

from

production
for
future
generations
in

energy

amounted
to
about
percent
of
the
value
of
the
fund
or
about
billion

the
end

the
commission
said

minister
siv
jensen
who
will
present
the
government
s
decision
this
autumn
did
not
signal
on
friday
which
way
a
decision
would
go
i
look
forward
to
reading
the
assessment
she
said
in
a
statement
the
fund
is
among
the
largest
investors
in
a
wide
range
of
oil
companies
holding
stakes
at
the
end
of
of
percent
in
shell
percent
of
bp
percent
of
chevron
and
percent
of
exxon
mobil
the
fund
also
held
percent
of
eni
percent
of
total
and
percent
of
lundin
petroleum
among
others
we
have
given
our
advice
and
we
are
now
awaiting
the
government
s
decision
deputy
central
bank
governor
egil
matsen
said
in
an
emailed
statement
to
reuters
in
a
scenario
with
sustained
lower
oil
prices
the
reduction
of
the
government
s
net
cash
flow
from
petroleum
activities
would
be
substantial
according
to
the
commission
a
sale
of
energy
stocks
would
also
challenge
the
investment
strategy
of
the
fund
with
broad
diversification
of
investments
and
a
high
threshold
for
exclusion
it
added
should
the
owner
seek
any
additional
reduction
in
oil
price
risk
it
is
likely
to
be
more
effective
to
reduce
the
norwegian
state
s
direct
ownership
in
equinor
or
the
state
s
direct
financial
interest
oil
firm
petoro
the
commission
said
the
norwegian
state
owns
percent
of
equinor
formerly
known
as
statoil
and
percent
of
petoro
successive
norwegian
governments
have
ruled
out
reducing
the
state
s
stakes
in
those
companies
some
observers
of
the
fund
did
not
welcome
the
commission
s
findings
this
recommendation
will
prove
to
be
a
failure
and
the
norwegian
government
will
be
forced
to
change
this
as
fossil
fuel
investments
continue
to
drag
down
global
investment
indexes
and
the
norwegian
economy
