on

they
also
declared
the
end
of
a
tsunami
of
tech
fund
inflows
which
have
driven
the
market
higher
noting
tiny
inflows
of
billion
this
week
after
a
huge
billion
plowed
into
tech
some
billion
flowed
into
equities
funds
and
billion
left

polarized
bull
in
a
note
titled
the
old

nod
to

they
argued
the

narrow

whose
total

cap
of
around

is
greater
than

european
equity
funds
suffered
a
straight
week
of
outflows
losing
billion
since
march
they
have
given
back
all
billion
of
the
inflows
of
to
strategists
noted
emerging
markets
in
contrast
have
not
seen
outflows
as
severe
as
that
with
less
than
percent
of
em
debt
and
equity
inflows
over
redeemed
in
the
past
four
months
baml
strategists
found
this
week
investors
pulled
just
billion
from
em
stocks
while
em
debt
saw
its
biggest
outflows
in
eight
weeks
billion

losing
just
billion
gold
is
a
contrarian
buy
strategists
suggested
after
funds
invested
in
the
precious
metal
saw
their
biggest
outflows
since
december
this
week
bringing
outflows
over
the
past
three
months
to
billion
this
autumn
presents
a
fork
in
the
road
for
markets
with
the
possibility
of
severe
negative
shocks
as
well
as
a
more
positive
path
credit
contagion
caused
by
monetary
tightening
excess
debt
and
a
peak
in
the
profit
cycle
could
cause
widening
spreads
in
em
debt
to
hit
european
high
yield
and
investment
grade
strategists
said
recommending
a
short
in
bonds
in
this
scenario
a
second
possible
shock
could
come
from
an
autumn
of
hardball
politics
they
said
with
brexit
developments
italy
s
budget
and
trade
disputes
weighing
on
global
purchasing
managers
surveys
and
earnings
forecasts
a
sweep
by
democrats
in
elections
could
spur
a
switch
to
populist
redistribution
they
predicted
for
example
tightening
stock
buyback
regulation
the
best
trade
in
that
eventuality
would
be
to
short
tech
they
said
among
positive
catalysts
a
peak
in
inflation
the
bond
yield
edging
below
percent
and
china
stimulus
could
help
drive
em
and
european
earnings
estimates
higher
in
which
case
investors
should
hold
em
and
european
banks
an
acceleration
in
stock
buybacks
would
also
help
spur
markets
providing
a
new
injection
of
liquidity
akin
to
quantitative
easing
strategists
said
in
so
far
percent
of
profits
are
being
spent
on
buybacks
not
far
from
the
peak
of
percent
