the
dollar
fell
on
friday
set
for
its
biggest
weekly
decline
since
march
as
markets
braced
for
a
speech
by
federal
reserve
chair
jerome
powell
for
hints
on
the
direction
of
monetary
policy
while
a

barely
budged
the

against
a
basket

six
major

stood
at
down
percent
on
the
day
the
currency
took
a
hit
this
week
after
president
donald
trump
said
he
was
not
thrilled
with
the
federal
reserve
under
his
own
appointee
chairman
jerome
powell
for
raising
interest
rates
analysts
said
growing
political
uncertainty
reinforced
by
the
criminal
convictions
of
two
of
trump
s
this
week
was
keeping
the
dollar
under
pressure
despite
the
united
states
embarking
on
greater
monetary
tightening
than
elsewhere
in
the
current
state
of
the
political
system
that
is
dominated
by
doubts
in
the
system
of
checks
and
balances
remnants
of

negativity
remain

where
he
stands
on
the

most
recent
policy
meeting

the
central
bank
would
tighten
monetary
policy
soon
the
fed
