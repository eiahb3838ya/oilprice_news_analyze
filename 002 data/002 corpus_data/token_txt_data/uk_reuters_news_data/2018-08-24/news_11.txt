noble
group
ltd
faces
a
shareholders
meeting
on
monday
as
investors
vote
on
a
billion
debt
restructuring
plan
that
its
creditors
and
board
say
is
vital
to
prevent
insolvency
the
company
once
a
global
commodity
trader
with
ambitions
to
rival
glencore
or
vitol
has
shrunk
to
an
business
focused
on
coal
and
freight
trading
after
it
slashed
hundreds
of
jobs
and
sold
prized
assets
to
cut
debt
noble
whose
market
value
has
been
nearly
wiped
out
from
billion
in
february
is
expected
to
win
the
required
simple
majority
of
voters
in
attendance
at
the
meeting
said
multiple
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
equity
owners
include
china

noble
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
a
comment
on
the
vote
noble
already
has
majority
support
from
its
creditors
and
the
backing
of
percent
of
its
shareholders
such
as
founder
richard
elman
who
stepped
down
as
chairman
last
year
under
the
swap
it
plans
to
halve
its
debt
after
surrendering
percent
of
control
to
its
senior
creditors
mainly
made
up
of
hedge
funds
while
existing
shareholders
stakes
will
dwindle
to
percent
and
its
management
would
get
percent
the
expectation
is
for
the
restructuring
to
be
passed
as
noble
needs
a
simple
majority
at
the
meeting
said
neel
gopalakrishnan
credit
strategist
at
dbs
group
it
would
come
as
a
big
surprise
if
it
doesn
t
come
noble
s
accounting
came
under
scrutiny
in
february
when
a
former
employee
arnaud
vagner
started
to
publish
reports
anonymously
under
the
name
of
iceberg
research
alleging
noble
inflated
the
prices
of
derivative
contracts
the
company
held
to
appear
more
profitable
noble
has
always
stood
by
its
accounts
as
noble
s
shares
and
bonds
plunged
after
the
allegations
the
company
lost
its
investment
grade
rating
took
billions
of
dollars
in
impairment
losses
and
lost
access
to
funding
it
also
changed
its
chief
executive
officers
graphic
the
rise
fall
of
noble
group
desperate
to
slash
debt
noble
sold
a
string
of
assets
but
this
was
not
enough
to
run
a
trading
business
where
profit
margins
are
tiny
it
posted
a
record
billion
loss
for
and
then
defaulted
on
its
debt
in
march
it
s
just
impossible
in
commodity
trading
to
operate
with
so
high
interest
costs
it
is
what
people
are
once
again
going
to
realise
vagner
told
reuters
referring
to
the
restructured
noble
is
the
new
team
more
competent
than
the
previous
one
no
it
s
the
same
the
share
price
is
down
percent
with
this
management
he
said
by
email
noble
s
restructuring
plan
gained
ground
in
june
after
it
won
over
a
key
shareholder
with
a
sweetened
offer
if
noble
does
not
obtain
shareholders
approval
it
will
seek
to
implement
a
similar
restructuring
to
keep
the
firm
as
a
going
concern
but
that
plan
does
not
provide
for
shareholders
to
receive
any
equity
in
the
new
company
analysts
are
still
wary
of
the
new
company
s
prospects
while
its
current
debt
problems
will
be
temporarily
fixed
it
will
need
ready
access
to
trade
financing
which
is
critical
to
its
business
said
brayan
lai
analyst
at
bondcritic
who
publishes
on
independent
research
platform
smartkarma
noble
s
ability
to
make
profits
on
a
sustainable
basis
would
be
the
main
challenge
for
its
remaining
business
