two
days
of
talks
on

with
no
major
breakthrough
as
their
trade
war
escalated
with
activation
of
another
round
of
duelling
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
each
country
s
goods
we
concluded

days
of
discussions
with

and
exchanged

balance
and
reciprocity
in

white

lindsay

said
in
a

the

included
addressing
structural
issues
in
china
including
its
intellectual
property
and
technology
transfer
policies
walters
said
the
trump

officials
participating
in

would
brief
the

on
the

she
added
implementation

percent
tariffs
on

did
not
derail
the
talks
led
by

under
secretary
david
malpass
and
chinese
commerce
vice
minister
wang
shouwen
they
were

trade
with
china
earlier
a
senior
trump
administration
official
downplayed
chances
for
success
saying
china
had
yet
to
address
complaints
about
alleged
misappropriation
of
intellectual
property
and
industrial
subsidies
in
order
for
us
to
get
a
positive
result
out
of
these
engagements
it
s
really
critical
that
they
china
address
the
fundamental
concerns
that
we
have
raised
the
official
said
on
a
press
call
on
the
new
security
review
law
for
foreign
acquisitions
we
haven
t
seen
that
yet
but
we
are
going
to
continue
to
encourage
them
to
address
problems
that
we
have
in
a
brief
statement
on
friday
the
chinese
commerce
ministry
said
both
sides
had
a
constructive
and
candid
exchange
over
trade
issues
and
will
stay
in
touch
on
the
next
steps
speaking
in
beijing
chinese
foreign
ministry
spokesman
lu
kang
said
china
did
not
like
providing
a
running
commentary
while
talks
were
under
way
and
preferred
to
quietly
do
the
work
this
round
of
trade
negotiations
is
the
same
if
you
want
to
seriously
talk
for
a
good
outcome
then
you
should
do
so
earnestly
there
s
no
need
to
speak
out
loudly
he
told
a
daily
news
briefing
china
s
commerce
ministry
said
in
beijing
that
it
has
filed
a
complaint
with
the
world
trade
organization
over
the
latest
round
of
tariffs
the
two
countries
have
now
targeted
billion
of
each
other
s
goods
and
threatened
duties
on
most
of
the
rest
of
their
bilateral
trade
raising
concerns
that
the
conflict
could
dent
global
economic
growth
trump
administration
officials
have
been
divided
over
how
hard
to
press
beijing
but
the
white
house
appears
to
believe
it
is
winning
the
trade
war
as
china
s
economy
slows
and
its
stock
markets
tumble
economists
reckon
that
every
billion
of
imports
hit
by
tariffs
would
reduce
global
trade
by
around
percent
they
have
assumed
a
direct
impact
on
china
s
economic
growth
in
of
to
percentage
point
and
somewhat
less
for
the
united
states
but
the
impact
will
be
bigger
next
year
along
with
collateral
damage
for
other
countries
and
companies
tied
into
china
s
global
supply
chains
business
groups
expressed
hope
that
the
meeting
would
mark
the
start
of
serious
negotiations
over
chinese
trade
and
economic
policy
changes
demanded
by
trump
however
trump
on
monday
told
reuters
in
an
interview
he
did
not
anticipate
much
from
this
week
s
talks
his
hard
line
has
rattled
beijing
and
spurred
rare
criticism
within
the
highest
levels
of
china
s
ruling
communist
party
over
its
handling
of
the
trade
dispute
sources
have
said
beijing
has
denied
allegations
it
systematically
forces
the
unfair
transfer
of
technology
and
has
said
it
adheres
to
world
trade
organization
rules
washington
s
latest
tariffs
apply
to
product
categories
including
semiconductors
plastics
chemicals
and
railway
equipment
that
the
office
of
the
trade
representative
has
said
benefit
from
beijing
s
made
in
china
industrial
plan
to
make
china
competitive
in
industries
china
s
list
of
product
categories
hit
with
duties
includes
coal
copper
scrap
fuel
steel
products
buses
and
medical
equipment
though
it
is
too
early
for
trade
damage
to
show
up
in
much
economic
data
tariffs
are
beginning
to
increase
costs
for
consumers
and
businesses
on
both
sides
of
the
pacific
forcing
companies
to
adjust
supply
chains
and
pricing
with
some
companies
looking
to
decrease
reliance
on
china
john
neuffer
president
of
the
semiconductor
industry
association
said
the
tariffs
would
hurt
companies
more
than
chinese
firms
since
most
semiconductor
products
imported
from
china
started
out
as
chips
fabricated
in
the
united
states
putting
tariffs
on
semiconductors
specifically
doesn
t
give
the
administration
additional
leverage
the
chinese
don
t
sell
their
own
semiconductors
to
america
so
chinese
enterprises
won
t
be
hurt

this
