hundreds
of
people
were
evacuated
from
their
homes
as
around
firefighters
battled
a
blaze
in
a
forest
strewn
with
unexploded
ammunition
south
of
berlin
on
friday
and
a
pall
of
acrid
smoke
hung
over
the
city
attempts
to
fight
the
fire
were
complicated
by
the
presence
of
the
ammunition
thought
to
date
from
the
soviet
army
s
activities
in
former
east
germany
the
blaze
about
km
miles
southeast
of
berlin
spread
rapidly
overnight
to
cover
an
area
the
size
of
football
fields
aided
by
the
parched
conditions
after
one
of
europe
s
hottest
summers
in
living
memory
i
have
huge
respect
for
the
firefighters
who
are
out
there
right
now
risking
their
lives
we
know
there
is
ammunition
lying
around
in
the
forest
said
local
politician
guenther
baaske
adding
that
some
explosions
had
been
heard
the
summer
has
seen
forest
fires
across
much
of
eastern
germany
but
this
blaze
so
close
to
its
largest
city
led
authorities
to
activate
emergency
alert
systems
in
the
early
hours
of
friday
telling
berliners
to
shut
their
windows
helicopters
dropped
water
on
flames
near
the
village
of
treuenbrietzen
and
a
reuters
photographer
saw
firefighters
spraying
water
in
a
blackened
landscape
thick
with
smoke
flames
came
within
metres
of
houses
in
some
places
authorities
said
people
had
to
leave
their
homes
with
many
forced
into
emergency
accommodation
in
many
places
flames
reached
as
high
as
the
forest
canopy
in
the
ordinarily
swampy
region
that
surrounds
berlin
