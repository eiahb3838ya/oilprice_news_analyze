special report-morales, indigenous icon, loses support among bolivia's native people
charagua
bolivia
reuters
in
years
as
president
of
south
america
s
poorest
country
evo
morales
has
accomplished
many
of
the
goals
he
set
forth
when
he
became
the
first
indigenous
person
to
lead
bolivia
the
leftist
and
former
coca
farmer
has
presided
over
an
economy
that
has
grown
by
an
annual
average
of
percent
since
he
took
office
more
than
twice
the
rate
for
all
of
latin
america
after
nationalizing
the
country
s
bounteous
natural
gas
reserves
he
pursued
economic
policies
and
invested
export
revenue
in
social
programs
that
helped
lift
more
than
two
million
people
nearly
a
fifth
of
the
population
from
poverty
with
a
new
constitution
in
he
even
changed
the
name
of
the
country
from
the
republic
of
bolivia
to
the
plurinational
state
of
bolivia
reflecting
diverse
ethnicities
that
for
centuries
had
felt
like
citizens
for
bolivia
s
more
than
million
indigenous
people
support
for
morales
appeared
to
pay
off
the
poverty
rate
dropped
from
percent
in
to
percent
last
year
access
for
indigenous
communities
to
electricity
sewerage
and
water
service
all
grew
according
to
the
world
bank
here
in
charagua
in
the
country
s
remote
southern
lowlands
guarani
people
recently
dissolved
the
local
municipality
and
launched
bolivia
s
first
experiment
in
autonomous
government
the
move
made
possible
by
the
new
constitution
is
meant
to
replace
distant
homogenous
rule
with
policies
tailored
to
the
local
indigenous
reality
yet
here
and
across
bolivia
indigenous
people
are
increasingly
turning
against
evo
as
the
morales
is
known
the
dissatisfaction
over
everything
from
proposed
development
of
indigenous
lands
to
his
successful
gambit
to
end
term
limits
is
marring
what
had
been
widespread
acclaim
for
a
leader
emblematic
to
first
peoples
movements
worldwide
his
way
of
thinking
and
his
actions
aren
t
indigenous
said
gualberto
cusi
a
former
judge
and
ethnic
aymara
an
influential
andean
tribe
from
which
morales
himself
also
hails
cusi
who
was
barred
from
the
constitutional
court
by
congress
last
year
after
disagreements
with
the
government
now
leads
a
group
of
indigenous
dissidents
many
aymara
have
flourished
under
morales
rule
building
upon
a
long
history
selling
textiles
along
lake
titicaca
they
now
thrive
in
commerce
like
importing
chinese
electronics
they
sell
as
far
afield
as
the
amazon
rainforest
but
even
they
are
increasingly
fed
up
he
should
go
said
joaquin
quispe
a
cook
whose
aymara
family
moved
from
bolivia
s
interior
to
el
alto
a
city
where
a
swelling
indigenous
influx
in
recent
years
made
it
outgrow
nearby
la
paz
the
country
s
administrative
centre
what
particularly
bothers
some
are
moves
by
morales
using
supporters
in
congress
and
the
judiciary
to
consolidate
power
although
his
own
constitution
set
a
limit
of
two
terms
morales
asked
voters
in
a
referendum
to
let
him
run
again
in
when
they
said
no
morales
convinced
the
constitutional
court
to
let
him
anyway
the
court
consisting
of
jurists
nominated
by
congressional
allies
ruled
that
term
limits
are
a
violation
of
his
human
morales
spokeswoman
gisela
lopez
declined
to
make
the
president
available
for
an
interview
and
didn
t
respond
to
requests
for
comment
for
this
story
a
close
ally
former
senate
president
jose
gringo
gonzales
said
morales
hasn
t
abandoned
indigenous
peoples
but
has
evolved
as
president
to
represent
and
work
with
everyone
he
can
sit
for
one
minute
with
a
businessman
and
the
next
with
a
worker
said
gonzales
who
stepped
down
from
the
senate
last
week
for
undisclosed
reasons
he
still
has
the
humility
and
simplicity
that
were
highlighted
when
he
took
morales
is
now
the
longest
consecutively
serving
head
of
state
in
the
americas
he
is
the
sole
leader
remaining
from
a
wave
of
leftists
including
venezuela
s
hugo
chavez
and
luiz
inacio
lula
da
silva
of
brazil
who
dominated
latin
american
politics
early
this
century
his
name
which
graces
schools
stadiums
and
cultural
centres
is
increasingly
voiced
in
street
protests
and
scrawled
in
graffiti
all
over
the
divided
country
bolivia
said
no
sprayings
compete
with
evo
yes
signs
painted
by
supporters
of
his
party
movement
toward
socialism
or
mas
morales
won
t
go
before
voters
again
until
late
next
year
and
the
opposition
remains
fragmented
meaning
no
other
leader
in
bolivia
as
yet
compares
in
political
stature
still
in
a
july
poll
commissioned
by
newspaper
pagina
siete
support
for
the
president
among
likely
voters
fell
to
percent
from
percent
last
november
a
survey
by
pollster
ipsos
this
week
showed
a
similar
level
of
support
at
percent
of
likely
voters
with
a
drop
over
the
past
year
in
his
approval
rating
now
at
percent
over
the
past
eight
months
reuters
travelled
across
bolivia
to
better
understand
the
waning
support
for
the
president
among
indigenous
peoples
from
his
native
altiplano
the
high
arid
plateau
home
to
the
aymara
to
lowlands
where
the
government
has
authorized
extraction
on
indigenous
lands
many
native
bolivians
say
they
no
longer
feel
represented
by
morales
for
many
the
years
following
morales
s
election
were
marked
by
jubilation
and
hope
before
his
official
inauguration
in
january
aymara
maestros
or
ritual
leaders
held
their
own
ceremony
at
the
site
of
tiwanaku
west
of
la
paz
morales
in
a
traditional
red
tunic
climbed
the
akapana
pyramid
where
shamans
presided
over
a
fire
ritual
and
presented
him
with
a
staff
symbolizing
his
right
to
lead
the
assembled
tribes
today
begins
a
new
era
for
the
native
peoples
of
the
world
morales
said
tens
of
thousands
of
indigenous
activists
along
with
native
delegations
from
as
far
away
as
chile
and
the
united
states
cheered
within
months
he
began
asserting
his
plans
to
decolonize
bolivia
and
give
locals
more
voice
in
government
and
a
greater
share
of
national
wealth
on
may
labor
day
he
ordered
troops
to
occupy
natural
gas
fields
and
nationalized
all
hydrocarbons
the
time
has
come
the
day
a
historic
day
for
bolivia
to
retake
absolute
control
of
our
natural
resources
he
said
in
a
speech
while
surrounded
by
soldiers
at
an
oil
field
operated
by
petroleo
brasileiro
or
petrobras
the
brazilian
energy
company
morales
began
renegotiating
energy
contracts
for
a
bigger
share
of
the
profits
a
move
that
ultimately
many
companies
agreed
to
the
negotiations
earned
him
plaudits
from
supporters
and
boosted
government
revenues
at
a
time
when
gas
prices
were
soaring
with
the
windfalls
morales
enacted
measures
including
school
vouchers
for
kids
and
pensions
for
workers
who
had
never
held
formal
employment
for
the
business
of
governance
morales
appointed
women
indigenous
peoples
and
labour
leaders
to
his
cabinet
he
embraced
organizations
and
forged
a
unity
pact
comprising
leaders
of
andean
lowland
and
amazon
tribes
together
they
helped
draft
the
new
constitution
approved
by
percent
of
bolivians
in
a
referendum
that
year
in
a
landslide
morales
won
a
second
term
tensions
with
indigenous
groups
first
emerged
in
enjoying
what
by
then
was
steadily
improving
economic
growth
morales
proposed
a
road
through
the
isiboro
secure
indigenous
territory
or
tipnis
a
refuge
in
the
amazon
the
highway
morales
argued
was
necessary
to
bring
basic
services
to
remote
tribes
but
native
groups
and
environmentalists
were
enraged
the
road
they
argued
more
likely
would
facilitate
drug
trafficking
illegal
logging
and
other
unwanted
activity
protesters
marched
for
more
than
a
month
during
which
police
and
demonstrators
clashed
in
clouds
of
tear
gas
and
flurries
of
rubber
bullets
when
evo
took
office
we
thought
indigenous
people
would
never
have
to
march
again
said
adolfo
chavez
a
native
tacana
and
former
president
of
the
confederation
of
indigenous
people
of
bolivia
or
cidob
a
grouping
of
lowland
tribes
the
marching
succeeded
at
least
for
a
time
that
september
morales
halted
work
on
the
road
for
further
study
but
relations
with
some
native
groups
were
damaged
two
major
indigenous
rights
organizations
cidob
and
the
national
council
of
ayllus
and
markas
of
qullasuyu
left
the
unity
pact
since
then
the
split
has
widened
into
divisions
that
fall
along
political
lines
not
rivalries
among
bolivia
s
three
dozen
ethnicities
soon
government
supporters
began
to
pressure
both
groups
using
mas
loyalists
to
stage
what
some
members
described
as
coups
within
the
organizations
politics
and
loyalty
to
morales
began
to
matter
more
than
the
indigenous
cause
they
said
cidob
leader
chavez
was
voted
out
in
chavez
who
left
bolivia
and
now
lives
in
peru
says
he
was
a
victim
of
political
persecution
for
leading
the
tipnis
demonstrations
pedro
vare
cidob
s
current
leader
in
local
media
has
continued
to
back
morales
and
criticise
the
protesters
reuters
was
unable
to
reach
vare
for
an
interview
one
rainy
evening
in
december
mas
activists
broke
down
the
door
of
the
la
paz
headquarters
of
conamaq
as
the
other
indigenous
rights
group
is
known
once
inside
they
forced

some
of
whom
were
visiting
la
paz
from
remote
regions
and
living
there
during
their
stay
to
leave
we
had
nowhere
to
go

now

at
both
groups

hilarion
mamani
a
quechua
who
led
the
conamaq
takeover
told
reuters
a
purge
had
been
necessary
using
a
charge
long
wielded
against
opponents
by
some
leftists
in
latin
america
mamani
said
previous
leaders
were
acting
on
behalf
of
north
american
now
he
added
there
are
no
that
s
because
most
of
the
previous
members
went
on
to
form
dissident
indigenous
groups
those
groups
have
campaigned
to
enforce
presidential
term
limits
and
against
renewed
efforts
to
build
the
tipnis
road
and
other
projects
on
native
lands
in
morales
began
his
sustained
effort
to
stay
in
power
despite
the
constitutional
limit
of
two
terms
morales
argued
that
his
first
administration
shouldn
t
be
counted
because
he
had
been
elected
under
a
previous
constitution
in
the
constitutional
court
by
then
composed
mostly
of
judges
nominated
by
allies
of
morales
in
congress
he
found
a
sympathetic
audience
except
for
one
justice
cusi
the
fellow
aymara
who
at
that
time
sat
on
the
court
cusi
sought
a
strict
interpretation
of
the
charter
and
argued
against
another
term
but
the
other
judges
prevailed
morales
ran
for
and
with
percent
of
the
vote
won
a
third
term
starting
in
january
before
long
relations
with
native
groups
grew
worse
still
in
february
a
government
comptroller
discovered
a
million
million
shortfall
in
a
state
fund
for
indigenous
projects
finding
records
of
initiatives
that
had
been
funded
but
never
carried
out
two
of
morales
former
rural
development
ministers
were
convicted
of
misusing
public
funds
and
served
brief
jail
terms
some
onetime
morales
supporters
were
outraged
it
seems
corruption
has
been
institutionalized
edwin
prada
a
lawyer
and
former
advisor
to
conamaq
said
in
an
interview
morales
in
public
comments
has
said
the
fund
was
poorly
run
reuters
couldn

either
of
the
two
former
ministers
for
comment
that
year
natural
gas
prices
fell
from
a
peak
in
the
country
s
economy
while
still
healthier
than
that
of
many
neighbours
cooled
criticism
of
morales
and
his
party
grew
in
march
residents
of
el

formerly
a
bastion
of
morales
support
handed

its
first
big
electoral
defeat
they
voted

who
had
polarized
local
voters

of
municipal
spending
and
elected
soledad
chapeton
an
aymara
from
a

who
became
the
city
s
first
female
mayor
morales
meanwhile
kept
working
to
prolong
his
own
mandate
first
through
the
failed
referendum
and
then
through
another
plea
to
the
constitutional
court
by
last
year
the
court
was
firmly
allied
with
morales
after
opposing
other
government
initiatives
cusi
the
aymara
judge
was
impeached
by
the
senate
the
day
before

and
scoffed
at

he
considered
his
foregone
ouster
lord

evo
morales
he
said
before
television
cameras
order
your
puppet
senators
to

officially
cusi
was
accused
of
failing
to
fulfil

but
many

critics
called

last
year
students

a

of

began
demonstrating
