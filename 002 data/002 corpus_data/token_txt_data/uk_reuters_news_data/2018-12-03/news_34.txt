london
reuters
qatar
s
decision
to
quit
opec
shows
the
frustration
of
small
producers
at
the
dominant
role
of
a
saudi
and
panel
a
top
iranian
official
said
adding
that
any
supply
cuts
should
come
only
from
countries
that
had
increased
output
the
comments
underline
tensions
within
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
ahead
of
this
week
s
meeting
to
discuss
curbing
output
and
prolonging
a
pact
with
russia
and
other
into
iran
has
been
angered
by
higher
production
from
saudi
arabia
and
russia
which
chair
a
panel
called
the
joint
ministerial
monitoring
committee
jmmc
after
calls
from
president
donald
trump
to
pump
more
oil
to
offset
a
drop
in
iranian
exports
hit
by
sanctions
this
is
very
regrettable
and
we
understand
their
frustration
iran
s
opec
governor
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
told
reuters
referring
to
doha
s
announcement
on
monday
there
are
many
other
opec
members
frustrated
that
the
jmmc
is
deciding
on
production
unilaterally
and
without
the
required
prior
consensus
of
oil
prices
have
fallen
from
a
high
above
a
barrel
in
early
october
on
concerns
over
excess
supply
opec
and
its
allies
which
have
had
a
supply
pact
since
meet
in
vienna
on
thursday
and
friday
to
discuss
supply
cuts
since
may
they
have
inflicted
a
loss
on
all
members
kazempour
said
in
reference
to
the
jmmc
flooded
the
market
and
created
a
huge
glut
which
is
building
stocks
with
this
behavior
for
small
producers
there
is
no
merit
to
stay
in
iran
believes
that
any
supply
reduction
should
come
from
those
who
pumped
more
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
provided
the
largest
increases
rather
than
all
opec
and
countries
involved
in
the
current
accord
now
they
are
asking
others
to
share
in
the
cut
whoever
increased
they
should
cut
kazempour
said
the
pilot
and
crashed
the
plane
and
all
passengers
are
now
in
critical
condition
with
this
record
of
failure
i
doubt
that
the
declaration
of
cooperation
will
be
russia
and
saudi
arabia
by
contrast
want
to
renew
and
institutionalize
the
cooperation
deal
