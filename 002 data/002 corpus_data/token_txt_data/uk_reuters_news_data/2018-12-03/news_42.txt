fears
led
the

with
a

to

since
the
gains
came
after
china
and
the
united
states
agreed
at

to
halt

the

felices
head
of

and
strategy
in
the

team
at
bnp
paribas
asset
management
the
first
was
markets
pricing
in
a
more
dovish
fed
the
second
more
aggressive
policy
stimulus
by
the
chinese
authorities
and
the
third
easing
trade
tensions
he
said
felices
cautioned
however
that
negotiations
had
reached
a
ceasefire
rather
than
lasting
peace
china
can
deliver
on
the
easy
things
like
buying
more
agriculture
as
they
need
those
goods
but
when
you
go
into
the
territory
of
intellectual
property
and
industrial
and
technology
policy
you
are
clashing
with
china

aims

climbed

and

the
mood
saw
msci
s
index
of

rise
percent
led
by
china
s
yuan
which
saw
its
biggest
daily
gain
since
februeary
however
the
dollar
started
to
recover
after
slumping
as
much
as
half
a
percent
earlier
against
a
basket
of
currencies
by
gmt
it
was
just
percent
lower
knocking
the

off

the

said
referring
to
a

vote
on
prime

theresa
may
s
agreement
on
leaving
the

however
the

has
already
come
under
some
pressure
from
a
recent
shift
by
the
federal
reserve
to
a
slightly
more
dovish
stance
comments
by
federal
reserve
chair
jerome
powell
were
interpreted
by

as
hinting
at
a
slower
pace
of
rate
increases
powell
was
scheduled
to
testify
later
this
week
to
a
congressional
joint
economic
committee
the
latest
market
rally
would
not
bring
a
return
to
a
more
hawkish
fed
stance
berenberg

florian

said
we
would
