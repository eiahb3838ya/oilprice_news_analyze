perhaps
the
most
interesting
thing
to
try
and
calculate
after
the
seeming
trade
ceasefire
between
the
united
states
and
china
is
the
level
of
cynicism
that
will
greet
the
new
detente
president
donald
trump
and
his
chinese
counterpart
xi
jinping
agreed
to
halt
imposing
additional
tariffs
on
each
other
s
imports
while
they
try
to
reach
a
deal
to
end
their
trade
dispute
within
days
the
agreement
reached
at
a
meeting
between
the
two
leaders
at
the
weekend
summit
in
buenos
aires
certainly
appears
to
be
a
of
trade
tensions
and
it
does
provide
yet
another
opportunity
for
some
sort
of
lasting
deal
however
it
also
appears
long
on
rhetoric
and
short
on
substance
largely
in
keeping
with
much
of
trump
s
pattern
of
dealing
with
foreign
trade
policies
the
mercurial
leader
was
effusive
on
the
meeting
with
xi
telling
reporters
on
air
force
one
that
china
has
agreed
to
immediately
buy
tremendous
amounts
of
agricultural
and
other
product
and
this
will
have
an
incredibly
positive
impact
on
farming
the
official
chinese
news
agency
xinhua
was
somewhat
more
circumspect
in
its
reporting
of
the
meeting
it
didn
t
mention
the
deadline
nor
any
agreement
to
step
up
agricultural
or
other
commodity
imports
instead
xinhua
stressed
the
two
leaders
had
agreed
not
to
escalate
the
tariff
war
and
to
take
immediate
efforts
to
address
issues
of
mutual
concern
based
on
mutual
respect
equality
and
mutual
benefit
the
more
sceptical
and
jaded
of
observers
may
conclude
that
it
seemed
trump
and
china
were
once
again
talking
past
each
other
and
in
days
time
washington
and
beijing
will
find
themselves
more
or
less
back
where
they
are
now
still
the
market
could
take
a
positive
view
of
the
development
certainly
crude
oil
s
initial
reaction
was
bullish
with
brent
rising
as
high
as
a
barrel
in
early
asian
trade
on
monday
up
percent
from
the
close
on
however
there
will
be
some
interesting
concrete
signals
within
that
period
perhaps
the
most
obvious
impact
of
the
trade
dispute
so
far
has
been
china
s
decision
to
almost
totally
cut
out
imports
of
soybeans
and
energy
commodities
such
as
crude
oil
coal
and
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
there
is
something
of
an
irony
in
this
one
of
trump
s
stated
aims
was
reducing
the
trade
deficit
with
china
but
the
dispute
has
widened
it
partly
because
china
stopped
buying
commodities
china
s
imports
of
commodities
had
shown
strong
growth
prior
to
the
imposition
of
tariffs
in
the
middle
of
this
year
imports
of
crude
peaked
in
june
this
year
when
almost
million
barrels
or
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
arrived
in
the
first
nine
months
of
this
year
china
imported
about
bpd
from
the
united
states
about
percent
of
its
total
crude
imports
but
this
dropped
to
zero
in
october
and
in
november
one
cargo
of
crude
was
discharged
according
to
data
compiled
by
refinitiv
no
cargoes
are
currently
booked
to
arrive
in
december
or
beyond
according
to
the
data
similar
to
crude
no
cargoes
of
lng
which
is
subject
to
chinese
tariffs
arrived
in
china
in
october
although
two
were
discharged
in
november
however
no
cargoes
are
slated
for
arrival
in
december
or
beyond
in
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
ships
delivered
a
total
of
million
tonnes
of
lng
from
the
united
states
to
china
representing
about
percent
of
total
imports
according
to
the
data
china
imported
zero
coal
subject
to
tariffs
in
october
two
cargoes
totalling
about
tonnes
in
november
and
none
are
scheduled
to
arrive
in
december
or
january
in
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
china
imported
million
tonnes
of
coal
the
majority
of
this
being
metallurgical
coal
used
in
steelmaking
china
s
imports
of
soybeans
fell
to
just
tonnes
in
october
down
from
million
tonnes
for
the
same
month
in
while
these
have
collapsed
since
may
imports
from
brazil
have
been
ramped
up
to
well
above
levels
however
china
has
in
the
past
boosted
its
purchases
of
soybeans
in
the
fourth
and
first
quarters
of
each
year
this
is
when
the
crop
is
ready
and
brazil
s
has
yet
to
be
harvested
what
this
means
in
terms
of
the
meeting
at
the
is
that
it
s
going
to
be
apparent
fairly
quickly
if
china
is
going
to
switch
tactics
and
resume
buying
commodities
it
will
be
relatively
simple
for
china
s
buyers
of
crude
oil
lng
coal
and
soybeans
to
the
market
and
fix
cargoes
from
the
united
states
it
will
still
take
several
months
for
cargoes
to
reach
china
and
show
up
in
import
figures
but
the
and
port
data
should
show
quite
quickly
if
cargoes
are
being
arranged
given
the
seeming
gap
in
the
expectations
of
washington
and
beijing
the
track
record
of
trump
in
his
positions
and
the
chinese
need
to
preserve
face
in
any
eventual
deal
the
safest
option
is
probably
to
be
sceptical
about
the
implications
of
the
meeting
