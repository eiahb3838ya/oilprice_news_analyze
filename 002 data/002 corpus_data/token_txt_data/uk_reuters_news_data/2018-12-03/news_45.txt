special report-u.s. 'clean coal' program fails to deliver on smog cuts
reuters
champions
of
coal
say
the
superabundant
fossil
fuel
can
be
made
environmentally
friendlier
by
refining
it
with
chemicals
a
clean
coal
technology
backed
by
a
billion
dollars
in
government
tax
subsidies
annually
but
refined
coal
has
a
dirty
secret
it
regularly
fails
to
deliver
on
its
environmental
promises
as
electric
giant
duke
energy
corp
found
duke
began
using
refined
coal
at
two
of
its
north
carolina
power
plants
in
august
the
decision
let
the
company
tap
a
lucrative
federal
subsidy
designed
to
help
the
american
coal
industry
reduce
emissions
of
nitrogen
oxides
also
known
as
nox
the
main
contributor
to
smog
and
acid
rain
along
with
other
pollutants
in
nearly
three
years
of
burning
the
treated
coal
the
duke
power
plants
collected
several
million
dollars
in
federal
subsidies
but
the
plants
also
pumped
out
more
nox
not
less
according
to
data
from
the
environmental
protection
agency
analysed
by
reuters
the
nox
emission
rate
at
duke
s
marshall
steam
station
power
plant
in
sherrills
ford
north
carolina
for
example
was
between
percent
and
percent
higher
in
the
three
years
from
to
than
in
the
year
before
marshall
started
burning
refined
coal
the
epa
data
shows
the
utility
also
discovered
that
one
of
the
chemicals
used
to
refine
the
coal
calcium
bromide
had
reached
a
nearby
river
and
lakes
raising
levels
of
carcinogens
in
the
water
supply
for
more
than
a
million
people
in
greater
stopped
using
refined
coal
at
the

in
may
because
of
the
water
pollution
problems

bromide
levels
in
the

dropped
sharply
several
months
later
said
barry
gullett
the
city
s
water
director
in
a
memo
duke
s
experience
reflects
a
fundamental
problem
with
the
clean
coal
incentive
programme
a
reuters
examination
has
found
refined
coal
shows
few
signs
of
reducing
nox
emissions
as
lawmakers
intended
according
to
regulatory
documents
a
reuters
analysis
of
epa
emissions
data
and
interviews
with
power
plant
owners
scientists
and
state
environmental
regulators
consumption
figures
compiled
by
the
energy
information
administration
show
that
american
power
plants
are
on
track
to
burn
about
million
tons
of
clean
coal
in
a
fifth
of
the
coal
market
that
amount
would
generate
about
billion
in
incentives
at
the
current
tax
credit
amount
of
per
ton
but
most
of
the
plants
receiving
the
subsidy
failed
to
reduce
nox
emissions
by
percent
the
threshold
required
under
the
policy
in
compared
to
the
last
year
before
they
started
burning
refined
coal
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of
epa
data
on
power
plant
emissions
reuters
identified
plants
that
burned
refined
coal
in
using
data
from
the
energy
information
administration
and
disclosures
from
energy
companies
and
developers
only
of
that
group
reduced
nox
emissions
by
more
than
percent
in
compared
to
and
of
those
only
reported
the
improvements
after
installing
or
upgrading
pollution
control
equipment
or
switching
a
portion
of
power
production
to
fuel
complicating
the
question
of
whether
their
pollution
reductions
are
attributable
to
refined
coal
at
of
the
plants
nox
emissions
were
higher
in
while
burning
refined
coal
than
they
were
when
using
raw
coal
in
as
a
group
the
fleet
of
power
plants
that
burn
refined
coal
also
underperformed
the
rest
of
the
industry
in
cutting
emissions
of
nox
the
reuters
analysis
found
nox
emissions
rates
declined
percent
among
the
power
plants
that
reported
burning
refined
coal
in
that
compares
with
a
percent
reduction
by
other
power
plants
over
the
same
period
the
analysis
included
power
plants
with
at
least
tons
in
annual
nox
emissions
in
investors
in
plants
that
failed
to
show
substantial
nox
emission
cuts
collected
the
tax
credit
anyway
because
the
internal
revenue
service
allows
them
to
prove
emissions
reductions
with
laboratory
tests
the
results
of
those
tests
conducted
for
several
hours
a
couple
of
times
a
year
often
do
not
translate
to
improvements
at
plants
that
burn
millions
of
tons
of
coal
annually
the
irs
which
approves
applications
for
the
tax
credit
declined
to
comment
on
the
design
or
effectiveness
of
the
testing
regimen
it
s
hard
to
hang
your
hat
on
refined
coal
as
the
way
to
reduce
nitrogen
oxide
emissions
said
ron
sahu
an
environmental
engineer
who
has
consulted
with
utility
companies
the
epa
and
the
justice
department
on
power
plant
emissions
sahu
who
reviewed
the
data
and
methodology
used
by
reuters
said
the
analysis
shows
refined
coal
has
little
to
no
impact
in
reducing
nox
emissions
at
actual
power
plants
it
s
clear
that
any
benefit
from
refined
coal
can
easily
be
overwhelmed
by
modest
changes
in
combustion
conditions
at
power
plants
sahu
said
it
s
debatable
that
a
tax
credit
should
be
given
for
nox
reuters
sent
its
analysis
of
epa
emissions
data
to
every
major
utility
operating
power
plants
that
burn
clean
coal
along
with
the
leading
investors
who
finance
clean
coal
facilities
in
partnerships
designed
to
take
advantage
of
the
subsidy
most
companies
declined
to
comment
or
did
not
respond
the
handful
that
did
respond
did
not
contest
the
findings
of
the
analysis
we
do
agree
with
the
overall
assessment
that
emission
controls
have
a
more
measurable
impact
on
emissions
reductions
over
refined
coal
dte
energy
a
utility
that
uses
refined
coal
told
reuters
the
edison
electric
institute
which
represents
the
electric
utility
industry
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
the
law
requires
all
refined
coal
producers
seeking
the
subsidy
to
show
that
burning
their
product
can
lead
to
a
percent
cut
in
nox
emissions
the
producers
also
must
show
a
percent
reduction
in
either
mercury
or
sulphur
dioxide
they
are
given
the
choice
of
which
of
those
two
pollutants
to
target
refined
coal
investors
tend
to
target
mercury
as
the
second
pollutant
for
cuts
according
to
disclosures
by
the
corporations
involved
in
the
programme
that
s
because
reducing
mercury
emissions
with
refined
coal
is
a
way
for
plants
to
comply
with
other
relatively
new
epa
regulations
governing
the
pollutant
utilities
already
have
spent
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
on
equipment
to
filter
out
sulphur
dioxide
making
additional
reductions
of
that
gas
more
difficult
the
subsidy
programme
has
been
more
successful
at
combating
mercury
than
nox
the
analysis
found
the
mercury
emission
rate
at
power
plants
burning
refined
coal
product
for
example
fell
percent
between
and
more
than
the
percent
cut
required
to
qualify
for
the
subsidy
some
of
those
cuts
can
also
be
attributed
to
other
pollution
control
measures
such
as
the
installation
of
scrubbers
that
filter
coal
plant
exhaust
according
to
the
epa
high
exposure
to
mercury
can
damage
the
intestines
kidney
and
nervous
system
according
to
the
epa
sulphur
dioxide
and
nox
can
cause
lung
damage
the
refined
coal
subsidy
was
adopted
by
congress
and
signed
into
law
by
president
george
bush
as
part
of
the
american
jobs
creation
act
of
alongside
credits
for
generating
renewable
energy
from
solar
and
wind
the
legislation
had
broad
bipartisan
support
and
generated
little
public
debate
the
subsidy
is
set
to
expire
in
and
lawmakers
including
north
dakota
republican
congressman
kevin
cramer
are
moving
to
extend
it
for
another
decade
the
programme
is
bridging
the
divide
to
make
coal
clean
and
beautiful
said
cramer
borrowing
president
donald
trump
s
two
favourite
adjectives
to
describe
coal
trump
has
promised
to
advance
the
interests
of
the
coal
industry
to
support
energy
jobs
his
administration
has
argued
coal
provides
a
more
reliable
fuel
for
power
generation
than
natural
gas
solar
and
wind
which
can
be
more
easily
interrupted

goldman

through

the

was
questioned
as
simply
too
good
to
be
true
the
utility
wrote
in
its
anniversary
report
released
in
the
deal
also
illustrates
how
the
potential
benefits
of
refined
coal
on
air
quality
can
be
erased
by
a
variety
of
complex
factors
the
new
madrid
plant
in
southeast
missouri
for
example
has
seen
its
production
of
nox
soar
to
a
higher
rate
than
any
other
coal
plant
while
burning
refined
coal
in
the
plant
s
nox
emission
rate
was
percent
higher
than
it
recorded
in
before
new
madrid
started
burning
clean
coal
according
to
the
epa
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
rate
jumped
even
further
to
seven
times
the
level
associated
electric
said
the
increase
in
nox
emissions
at
new
madrid
was
due
in
part
to
the
cooperative
s
purchasing
tradable
pollution
credits
through
the
system
the
system
sets
an
overall
limit
on
pollution
and
allows
power
plants
that
cut
their
pollution
to
earn
credits
that
can
be
stockpiled
or
sold
to
other
polluters
when
large
volumes
of
credits
are
generated
the
cost
of
buying
them
can
be
lower
than
the
cost
of
running
pollution
control
equipment
at
times
during
the
last
seven
years
associated
has
met
compliance
with
emissions
rules
by
purchasing
nox
credits
from
the
markets
rather
than
running
the
control
equipment
all
year
the
electric
cooperative
said
in
a
statement
which
it
issued
through
goldman
sachs
spokesman
michael
duvally
the
national
mining
association
which
represents
the
coal
industry
supports
extending
the
tax
credit
it
said
the
system
was
the
primary
reason
nox
emissions
went
up
at
many
power
plants
in
the
reuters
analysis
the
association
said
clean
coal
lowers
emissions
but
provided
no
data
to
support
the
claim
duke
energy
said
in
a
statement
that
routine
changes
in
electricity
demand
can
also
make
clean
coal
ineffective
in
reducing
nox
by
changing
boiler
temperatures
and
catalyst
conditions
in
pollution
control
devices
sahu
the
environmental
consultant
said
refined
coal
is
most
effective
at
reducing
nox
emissions
when
a
utility
burns
the
fuel
at
a
relatively
low
temperature
something
that
typically
occurs
when
electricity
demands
on
the
plant
are
low
but
using
low
temperatures
over
an
extended
period
can
also
damage
power
plant
boilers
by
causing
corrosion
and
soot
buildup
he
said
conversely
burning
the
coal
at
a
relatively
high
temperature
more
common
during
periods
can
reduce
the
risk
of
damage
but
limit
the
effectiveness
of
smog
reductions
the
grand
river
dam
authority
stopped
burning
refined
coal
at
its
oklahoma
power
plant
last
year
because
corrosion
and
other
problems
outweighed
any
upside
said
john
wiscaver
head
of
grda
s
corporate
communications
we
had
too
many
problems
with

he
said
refined
coal
has
also
led
to
contamination
of
water

for
more
than
a
million

according
to
regulators
