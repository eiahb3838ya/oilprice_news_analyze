political
leaders
on
monday
began
arriving
in
the
polish
coal
city
of
katowice
where
two
weeks
of
talks
have
begun
to
revive
the
landmark
paris
deal
on
climate
change
as
dire
warnings
mount
about
a
lack
of
action
representatives
of
some
of
the
most
powerful
countries
and
biggest
polluters
will
be
conspicuous
by
their
absence
as
the
united
states
has
said
it
is
leaving
the
process
and
china
was
not
expected
to
send
its
top
politicians
to
maximise
the
chances
of
success
technical
talks
began
on
sunday
a
day
earlier
than
planned
with
delegates
from
nearly
nations
haggling
over
how
to
implement
the
broad
promises
of
the
paris
deal
on
moving
away
from
fossil
fuel
the
talks
in
katowice
have
been
billed
as
the
most
important
conference
since
the
landmark
paris
accord
as
they
precede
an
deadline
to
agree
a
rule
book
on
how
to
enforce
action
to
limit
global
warming
to
between
and
degrees
celsius
expectations
for
the
polish
talks
are
low
the
atmosphere
of
political
unity
built
in
paris
has
been
shattered
by
a
wave
of
populist
governments
that
place
national
agendas
before
collective
action
the
host
nation
poland
remains
committed
to
coal
the
most
polluting
of
fossil
fuels
calling
for
a
just
transition
to
allow
communities
dependent
on
fossil
fuel
help
in
changing
their
lifestyle
the
riots
in
paris
at
the
weekend
partly
in
protest
at
higher
fuel
taxes
also
illustrate
the
conundrum
how
do
political
leaders
introduce
policies
that
will
do
good
for
the
environment
without
inflicting
extra
costs
on
voters
that
may
damage
their
chances
of
delegates
at
the
talks
said
the
biggest
issues
were
likely
to
include
finance
and
the
level
of
scrutiny
associated
with
monitoring
individual
nations
emissions
the
has
a
goal
to
raise
billion
every
year
from
for
climate
action
to
inject
momentum
the
world
bank
group
on
monday
said
it
would
provide
a
further
billion
over
five
years
from
the
start
of
the
next
decade
other
attempts
to
inject
urgency
into
the
polish
talks
will
include
an
intervention
from
british
broadcaster
and
environmentalist
david
attenborough
as
well
as
the
roughly
heads
of
state
and
government
who
are
attending
the
talks
