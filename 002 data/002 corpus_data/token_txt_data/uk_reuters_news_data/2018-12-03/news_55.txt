london

british
power
producer
drax
group
plc
has
revised
the
terms
of
its
deal
to
buy
uk
generation
assets
from
spain
s
iberdrola
to
ensure
it
gets
a
rebate
on
lost
capacity
payments
due
to
a
pause
in
a
government
scheme
in
october
drax
agreed
to
buy
some
uk
hydro
and
pumped
storage
power
plants
from
iberdrola
s
scottish
power
for
million
pounds
as
it
aims
to
exit
production
before
a
government
deadline
last
month
britain
had
to
halt
a
power
scheme
called
the
capacity
market
to
avoid
electricity
shortages
pending
a
further
investigation
by
european
union
regulators
the
scheme
pays
providers
for
making
energy
supplies
available
at
short
notice
to
avoid
shortages
that
might
occur
as
coal
plants
close
and
low
prices
dissuade
investors
from
building
new
power
plants
even
though
drax
believes
that
the
european
commission
will
reapprove
the
existing
capacity
market
in
its
current
or
similar
form
the
pause
has
put
payments
to
plants
it
is
buying
in
the
iberdrola
deal
at
risk
therefore
it
has
agreed
a
scheme
with
the
spanish
firm
as
a
result
which
could
mean
it
receives
a
payment
of
up
to
million
pounds
under
the
revised
terms
if
less
than
percent
of
capacity
payments
from
are
received
and
gross
profit
of
the
portfolio
for
the
full
year
is
less
than
million
pounds
iberdrola
will
pay
drax
up
to
million
pounds
similarly
if
gross
profit
is
more
than
million
plunds
drax
will
make
a
payment
to
iberdrola
of
up
to
million
pounds
when
the
deal
was
originally
announced
drax
expected
scottish
power
s
portfolio
of
assets
to
contribute
gross
profit
of
million
pounds

high
doused
by
eu
ruling
see
the
capacity
market
is
a
central
pillar
of
the
uk
s
energy
policy
and
ensures
security
of
supply
while
minimising
costs
to
consumers

gardiner
chief
executive
of
drax
group
said
in
a
statement
to
mitigate
the
risk
that
capacity
payments
take
time
to
be
restored
we
have
agreed
revised
terms
which
provide
protection
in
he
added
the
judgement
by
the
eu
s
general
court
in
october
annulled
a
decision
by
the
european
commission
which
had
said
britain
s
capacity
market
was
compatible
with
eu
state

could
take
a
year
or
more
for
the
capacity
market
to
be
reinstated
