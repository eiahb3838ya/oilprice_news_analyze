the

s
two
biggest

has
weighed
heavily

facing
import
tariffs
but
traders
said
the
positive
sentiment
was
supporting

markets
initial
signs
of
the
trade
relation
on
the

have
provided
a
boost
to

prices
in

nevertheless
whether

or

the
group
along
with

announce
cuts
aimed
at
reining
in
a
glut
that
has
pulled
down
crude
prices
by
around
a
third
since
october
we
feel
that
a
decline
of
about
million
barrels
per

will
be
required
if
fresh
price
lows
are
to
be
precluded
