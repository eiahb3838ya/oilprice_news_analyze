asian
shares
rallied
on
monday
after

chinese
leaders
brokered
a
truce
in
their
trade

a

for
the
global

and
a

for
emerging

battered

markets
are
opening
with
a
boost
to

appetite
but
time
will
tell
how
enduring
the

proves
to
be
said
anz
economist
jo
masters
there
are
already
very
different
official
takes
on
what
was
achieved
at
the
but
for
now
both
sides
can
claim
a
win
she
added
perhaps
not
insignificantly
it
provides
a
window
to
export
the
soybean
crop
from
key
republican
states
at
china
and
the
united
states
agreed
to
halt
additional
tariffs
in
a
deal
that
keeps
their
trade
war
from
escalating
as
the
two
sides
try
again
to
bridge
their
differences
with
fresh
talks
aimed
at
reaching
a
deal
within
days
the
white
house
said
on
saturday
that
president
donald
trump
told
chinese
president
xi
jinping
during
talks
in
argentina
that
he
would
not
boost
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
to
percent
on
as
previously
announced
deeply
contentious
thornier
structural
issues
such
as
forced
technology
transfer
remain
unresolved
cautioned
westpac
fx
analyst
robert
rennie
this
agreement
is
thus
better
characterised
as
a
that
puts
a
momentary
pause
on
trade
tensions
rather
than
a
comprehensive
policy
indeed
many
market
players
doubt
the
two
countries
can
bridge
their
differences
that
cover
a
range
of
issues
within
three
months
technology
is
becoming
the
main
battle
ground
it
s
not
just
a
trade
war
any
more
it
s
more
like
a
technology
war
in
which
we
just
found
a
temporary
lull
said
hiroshi
watanabe
economist
at
sony
financial
and
on
the
whole
there
is
still
uncertainty
over
the
outlook
for
corporate
earnings
amid
signs
of
slowing
growth
for
now

investors

the
dollar
had
come
under
pressure
last
week
when
comments
by
federal
reserve
chair
jerome
powell
were
interpreted
by
markets
as
hinting
at
a
slower
pace
of

powell
was
scheduled
to
testify
on
wednesday
to
a
congressional
joint
economic
committee

the
