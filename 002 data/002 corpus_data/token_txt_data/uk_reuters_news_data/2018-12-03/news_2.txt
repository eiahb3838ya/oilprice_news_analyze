kudlow
said
on
monday
the
trump
administration
wants
to
end
subsidies
for
electric
cars
and
other
items
including
renewable
energy
sources
asked
about
plans
after
general
motors
co
announced
plant
closings
and
layoffs
last
week
kudlow
pointed
to
the
tax
credit
for
consumers
who
buy
electric
vehicles
including
those
made
by
gm
under
federal
law
as
a
matter
of
our
policy
we
want
to
end
all
of
those
subsidies
kudlow
said
and
by
the
way
other
subsidies
that
were
imposed
during
the
obama
administration
we
are
ending
whether
it
s
for
renewables
and
so
asked
about
a
timeline
he
said
it
s
just
all
going
to
end
in
the
near
future
i
don
t
know
whether
it
will
end
in
or
the
tax
credits
are
capped
by
congress
at
vehicles
per
manufacturer
after
which
the
subsidy
phases
out
gm
has
said
it
expects
to
hit
the
threshold
by
the
end
of
which
means
under
the
current
law
its
tax
credit
scheme
would
end
in
tesla
inc
said
in
july
it
had
hit
the
threshold
other
automakers
may
not
hit
the
cap
for
several
years
experts
say
the
white
house
can
not
change
the
cap
unilaterally
president
donald
trump
last
week
threatened
to
eliminate
subsidies
for
gm
in
retaliation
for
the
company
s
decision
kudlow
made
clear
any
changes
in
subsidies
would
not
just
affect
gm
i
think
legally
you
just
can
t
he
said
democrats
will
take
control
of
the
house
in
january
and
are
unlikely
to
agree
to
end
subsidies
for
electric
cars
and
many
have
been
pushing
for
additional
incentives
tesla
and
gm
have
lobbied
congress
for
months
to
lift
the
cap
on
electric
vehicles
or
make
other
changes
but
face
an
uphill
battle
make
changes

the
current
congress

heller
proposed
lifting
the
current
cap
on
electric
vehicles
eligible

tax
credits
but
phase
out
the

the
entire
industry
in
two
other
senators

lifting
the
per
manufacturer
credit
and
extending
the
benefit
