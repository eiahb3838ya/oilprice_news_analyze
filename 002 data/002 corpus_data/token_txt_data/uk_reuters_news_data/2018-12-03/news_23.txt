msc
expects
to
pay
over
billion
billion
pounds
a
year
in
fuel
costs
due
to
tougher
global
marine
fuel
rules
and
will
introduce
a
bunker
charge
next

container
line
said
un
agency
the
international
maritime
organisation
imo
will
prohibit
ships
from
using
fuels
with
sulphur
content
above
percent
from
compared
with
percent
today
unless
they
are
equipped
with
exhaust
gas
cleaning
systems
known
as
scrubbers
to
clean
up
sulphur
emissions
for
shipping
companies
struggling
from
years
of
weaker
earnings
the
new
regulations
are
expected
to
mean
more
cost
pressure
msc
has
estimated
that
the
cost
of
the
various
changes
we
are
making
to
our
fleet
and
its
fuel
supply
is
in
excess
of
two
billion
dollars
usd
per
year
we
have
already
had
to
start
incurring
these
costs
to
be
ready
for
the
group
said
in
a
note
msc
said
it
would
levy
a
bunker
recovery
charge
from
as
a
result
of
the
regulatory
changes
we
all
support
the
group
has
a
fleet
of
vessels
with
a
total
capacity
of
million
teus
which
includes
both
owned
and
chartered
vessels
an
msc
spokesman
said
on
monday
clearly
msc
will
need
to
use
a
large
amount
of
fuels
to
propel
the
fleet
in
order
to
meet
the
cap
the
spokesman
said
at
the
same
time
a
significant
portion
of
msc
s
owned
ships
will
be
equipped
with
exhaust
gas
cleaning
systems
for
a
shipping
line
of
our
size
with
a
global
network
it
makes
sense
to
have
a
combination
of
these
in

from
maersk
has
said
it
expected
extra
fuel
costs
of
at
least

apart
from
scrubbers
and
low
sulphur
fuel
shipping
companies
can
also
use

still
at
