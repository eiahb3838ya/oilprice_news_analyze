british
broadcaster
and
environmentalist
david
attenborough
on
monday
urged
world
leaders
meeting
in
poland
to
agree
ways
to
limit
global
warming
to
get
on
and
tackle
our
greatest
threat
in
thousands
of
years
known
for
countless
nature
films
attenborough
has
gained
prominence
recently
with
his
blue
planet
ii
series
which
highlighted
the
devastating
effect
of
pollution
on
the
oceans
leaders
of
the
world
you
must
lead
said
the
naturalist
given
a
people
s
seat
at
the
climate
conference
in
the
polish
coal
city
of
katowice
alongside
two
dozen
heads
of
state
and
government
the
continuation
of
our
civilisations
and
the
natural
world
upon
which
we
depend
is
in
your
hands
he
said
the
world
is
currently
on
course
to
overshoot
by
far
the
limits
for
global
warming
agreed
in
the
landmark
paris
accord
on
climate
change
which
were
intended
to
prevent
more
extreme
weather
rising
sea
levels
and
the
loss
of
plant
and
animal
species
the
katowice
talks
are
billed
as
the
most
important
conference
since
paris
coming
ahead
of
an
deadline
to
agree
a
rule
book
on
enforcing
action
yet
political
and
leaders
have
been
struggling
to
inject
urgency
into
two
weeks
of
haggling
on
how
to
move
on
from
fossil
fuels
to
give
practical
effect
to
the
paris
accord
representatives
of
some
of
the
most
powerful
countries
and
biggest
polluters
were
conspicuous
by
their
absence
and
the
united
states
is
quitting
the
climate
process
to
maximise
the
chances
of
success
in
poland
technical
talks
began
on
sunday
a
day
early
with
delegates
from
nearly
nations
debating
how
to
meet
the
paris
target
of
limiting
global
warming
to
between
and
degrees
celsius
and
fahrenheit
michal
kurtyka
poland
s
deputy
environment
minister
and
president
of
the
talks
said
that
without
success
in
katowice
paris
would
not
be
a
success
as
it
had
only
decided
what
was
needed
not
how
it
could
be
done
moreover
the
wider
political
environment
had
changed
the
wave
of
optimism
and
global
cooperation
that
carried
us
to
and
through
paris
has
now
crested
broken
and
is
now
tumbling
he
told
delegates
he
nevertheless
took
heart
from
a
statement
at
the
weekend
when
the
leading
industrialised
nations
except
the
united
states
reaffirmed
their
commitment
to
implementing
the
paris
deal
a
series
of
reports
in
the
to
the
katowice
conference
have
made
clear
the
widening
gap
between
rhetoric
and
actual
work
to
cut
emissions
which
have
continued
to
rise
it
is
hard
to
overstate
the
urgency
of
our
situation
secretary
general
antonio
guterres
said
climate
change
is
running
faster
than
we
are
and
we
must
catch
up
sooner
rather
than
later
before
it
is
too
attenborough
told
the
delegates
right
now
we
are
facing
a
disaster
of
global
scale
our
greatest
threat
in
thousands
of
years
climate
yet
expectations
for
katowice
are
low
the
host
nation
poland
is
committed
to
coal
the
most
polluting
of
fossil
fuels
it
is
calling
for
a
just
transition
to
provide
help
for
communities
dependent
on
fossil
fuels
riots
in
paris
at
the
weekend
partly
in
protest
at
fuel
taxes
also
illustrate
the
conundrum
how
do
politicians
introduce
environmental
policies
without
inflicting
costs
on
voters
that
may
damage
their
chances
of
to
contain
warming
at
global
net
carbon
dioxide
emissions
will
need
to
fall
by
about
percent
by
from
levels
and
reach
net
zero
by
according
to
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
delegates
at
the
talks
said
sticking
points
were
likely
to
include
finance
and
the
level
of
scrutiny
associated
with
monitoring
individual
nations
emissions
the
has
a
goal
of
raising
billion
every
year
from
for
climate
action
to
inject
momentum
the
world
bank
group
on
monday
said
it
would
provide
a
further
billion
over
five
years
from
the
start
of
the
next
decade
