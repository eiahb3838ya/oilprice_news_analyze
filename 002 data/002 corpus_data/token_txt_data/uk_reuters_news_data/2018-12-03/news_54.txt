premier
rachel
notley
said
on
sunday
that
the
western
canadian
province
would
mandate
temporary
oil
production
cuts
to
deal
with
a
pipeline
bottleneck
that
has
led
to
a
glut
of
crude
in
storage
and
driven
down
canadian
crude
prices
the
new
democratic
party
government
will
force
producers
to
cut
output
by
percent
or
barrels
per
day
bpd
until
the
excess
crude
in
storage
is
drawn
down
the
cuts
will
then
drop
to
bpd
until
there
are
some
million
barrels
of
oil
in
storage
in
alberta
which
is
twice
the
normal
level
the
province
said
when
markets
aren
t
working
when
companies
are
forced
to
sell
our
resources
for
pennies
on
the
dollar
we
must
act

alberta
estimates
that
current
production
outstrips
pipeline
and
rail
capacity
by
bpd
the
production
cuts
to
be
applied
by
producer
rather
than
per
project
will
be
implemented
starting
in

select
wcs
heavy
blend
hit
a
record
at
below
the
west
texas
intermediate
wti
benchmark
last
month
which
meant
producers
were
getting
about
a
barrel
compared
with
about
for
wti
it
has
since
narrowed
slightly
as
the
wti
benchmark
price
has
fallen
and
crude
by
rail
volumes
has
ramped
up
the
province
said
the
curtailment
would
narrow
the
differential
by
at
least
a
barrel
there
will
be
penalties
for
but
no
specifics
were
given
notley
said
last
week
her
government
was
moving
ahead
with
plans
to
buy
about
locomotives
and
rail
cars
to
boost
crude
by
rail
capacity
by
bpd
by
the
premier
who
will
face
voters
in
an
election
that
must
be
held
by
the
end
of

noted
that
pipelines
were
preferred
to
all
other
options
but
blamed
successive
federal
governments
for
delays

facing
regulatory
delays
several
heavy
crude
producers
including
canadian
natural
resources
ltd
and
cenovus
energy
inc
have
voluntarily
curtailed
production
in
recent
weeks
mandated
cuts
are
controversial
as
producers
that
have
their
own
refineries
like
suncor
energy
inc
and
husky
energy
inc
do
not
face
the
same
impact
from
the
low
prices
notley
s
political
rivals
have
called
for
output
caps
the
province
estimates
some
producers
will
be
affected
by
the
measures
which
will
apply
only
to
companies
that
produce
more
than
bpd
