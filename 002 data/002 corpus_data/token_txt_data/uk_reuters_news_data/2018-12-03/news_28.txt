had
largely
completed
the
recent
wave
of
selling
in

there
were
clear

the

was
ending
at

combined
sales
in

of
just
million

the

found
a

there
were
continued
heavy
sales
of

contracts
linked
to
middle
distillates
such
as
gasoil
and
diesel
in
a
worrying
sign
for

portfolio
managers
were
net
sellers
of
million
barrels
of
heating
oil
and
million
barrels
of
european
gasoil
in
the
week
to
net
length
in
heating
oil
has
been
cut
to
just
million
barrels
from
a
recent
high
of
million
barrels
at
the
start
of
october
while
net
length
in
european
gasoil
has
been
cut
to
million
from
million
middle
distillates
which
are
mostly
consumed
in
freight
transportation
manufacturing
mining
and
farming
are
normally
the
tightest
part
of
the
oil
market
at
this
late
stage
of
the
economic
cycle
distillate
supplies
were
expected
to
become
especially
tight
this
time
with
the
introduction
of
new
regulations
that
will
force
many
ship
owners
to
switch
from
heavy
fuel
oil
to
cleaner
distillate
fuel
oil
from
the
start
of
but
concerns
about
distillate
availability
have
evaporated
in
recent
weeks
which
may
reflect
greater
confidence
about
the
smooth
introduction
of
the
new
rules
but
could
also
reflect
fears
about
a
global
economic
slowdown
