older
generations
have
messed
up
the
planet
letting
down
younger
people
who
are
angry
about
it
and
want
it
to
stop
british
naturalist
david
attenborough
said
on
monday
the
who
has
fronted
wildly
popular
television
series
documenting
nature
and
the
environment
said
on
the
sidelines
of
climate
talks
in
poland
that
betrayal
of
the
young
generation
left
him
with
a
sense
of
misery
i
have
done
my
best
to
speak
the
truth
as
i
see
it
but
young
people
know
that
the
world
is
warming
and
science
is
making
it
perfectly
clear
and
they
know
who
is
responsible
and
that
s
me
and
my
predecessors
and
going
back
even
further
than
that
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
even
though
most
world
leaders
have
backed
the
paris
agreement
to
tackle
climate
change
damage
to
coral
reefs
glaciers
and
forests
is
still
occurring
he
added
this
great
machine
is
tumbling
on
and
we
ve
got
to
stop
it
somehow
he
said
on
the
sidelines
of
climate
talks
the
talks
held
on
the
site
of
a
former
mine
in
poland
s
main
region
of
silesia
is
tasked
with
hammering
out
rules
to
put
the
paris
climate
accord
into
practice
in
the
three
years
since
governments
adopted
the
paris
agreement
the
political
will
to
fight
climate
change
has
faded
and
countries
are
not
delivering
on
their
commitments
chief
antonio
guterres
told
reporters
in
the
city
of
katowice
what
is
happening
on
the
ground
is
worse
than
predictions
he
said
with
seas
rising
faster
ice
melting
more
rapidly
and
disasters
becoming
more
dramatic
with
terrible
consequences
as
seen
in
hurricanes
that
hit
the
caribbean
last
year
greta
thunberg
a
swedish
who
has
inspired
a
global
movement
of
children
skipping
school
to
call
for
action
on
climate
change
met
guterres
telling
him
world
leaders
had
ignored
countless
people
standing
up
at
climate
summits
for
years
urging
them
to
curb
emissions
i
will
not
beg
world
leaders
to
care
for
our
future
she
told
reporters
i
will
instead
let
them
know
that
change
is
coming
whether
they
like
it
or
our
political
leaders
have
failed
us
she
added
kristalina
georgieva
chief
executive
officer
of
the
world
bank
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
conference
delegates
should
keep
pictures
of
their
children
and
grandchildren
in
front
of
them
when
negotiating
at
the
official
opening
ceremony
of
the
talks
on
monday
attenborough
presented
a
video
combining
clips
uploaded
to
social
media
by
people
from
all
over
the
world
in
the
past
two
weeks
using
the
twitter
hashtag
takeyourseat
the
video
shows
the
effects
people
are
suffering
due
to
climate
change
from
worsening
wildfires
to
storms
and
pollution
if
we
don
t
take
action
the
collapse
of
our
civilisations
and
the
extinction
of
much
of
the
natural
world
is
on
the
horizon
attenborough
warned
in
the
first
people
s
seat
address
at
climate
talks
the
aim
was
to
ensure
the
views
of
ordinary
people
were
heard
at
such
a
conference
that
can
seem
remote
to
many
the
broadcaster
said
afterwards
alongside
his
speech
the
united
nations
launched
facebook
messenger
software
that
will
help
people
learn
what
they
can
do
to
reduce
their
carbon
footprint
and
share
with
their
friends
how
they
are
making
a
difference
the
uses
artificial
intelligence
to
engage
with
users
and
help
answer
their
questions
on
climate
change
issues
while
many
people
take
small
actions
to
fight
climate
change
they
know
perfectly
well
that
in
the
end
it
has
to
go
through
governments
and
governments
need
to
hear
attenborough
said
thunberg
said
young
people
should
use
all
means
at
their
disposal
whether
social
media
or
direct
protests
such
as
school
strikes
to
raise
awareness
about
the
mess
created
by
older
people
we
have
to
make
our
voices
heard
and
make
them
try
to
clean
it
up
after
them
she
said
we
are
all
in
this
together
and
together
we
are
strong
and
we
will
not
give
up
she
added
in
a
message
of
solidarity
with
australian
students
who
also
went
on
strike
last
week
