explainer-why is canada's alberta forcing oil production cuts?
reuters
alberta
premier
rachel
notley
said
on
sunday
that
the
western
canadian
province
would
mandate
temporary
oil
output
cuts
to
deal
with
a
pipeline
bottleneck
that
has
led
to
a
glut
of
crude
in
storage
and
driven
down
canadian
crude
prices
the
production
caps
are
the
latest
effort
by
the
province
s
new
democratic
party
government
to
deal
with
historically
low
crude
prices
that
are
hurting
producers
and
dragging
on
government
revenues
western
canada
select
wcs
heavy
blend
crude
typically
trades
at
a
discount
to
the
west
texas
intermediate
wti
benchmark
with
the
lower
price
reflecting
the
cost
of
transport
and
the
quality
of
the
product
the
discount
has
typically
been
around
pounds
but
has
widened
in
the
past
few
months
to
trade
at
to
below
wti
hitting
a
record
at
below
wti
in
october
according
to
data
from
shorcan
crude
production
in
alberta
s
oil
sands
is
expanding
faster
than
pipeline
capacity
creating
a
bottleneck
and
leading
to
a
buildup
of
product
in
storage
more
crude
is
now
moving
across
the
border
by
rail
and
by
truck
but
it
is
not
enough
to
clear
the
glut
the
stranded
barrels
are
putting
pressure
on
prices
adding
to
the
woes
refinery
maintenance
has
taken
some
buyers
temporarily
offline
the
steep
discount
has
stripped
billions
of
dollars
from
the
canadian
economy
by
some
estimates
new
pipeline
capacity
is
alberta
s
preferred
solution
but
projects
face
fierce
opposition
from
environmentalists
and
some
aboriginal
groups
construction
is
under
way
on
enbridge
inc
s
line
pipeline
replacement
from
alberta
to
the
united
states
with
the
project
expected
to
be
in
service
by
the
end
of
transcanada
corp
s
keystone
xl
pipeline
from
alberta
to
the
united
states
is
facing
a
supplementary
environmental
assessment
after
a
federal
judge
in
montana
halted
construction
last
month
the
impact
on
timing
remains
unclear
the
near
tripling
of
capacity
on
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
from
alberta
to
a
port
in
the
vancouver
area
is
undergoing
a
new
regulatory
review
it
is
unclear
when
construction
on
the
federal
pipeline
will
begin
crude
by
rail
has
ramped
up
sharply
this
year
hitting
nearly
bpd
in
september
alberta
said
last
week
that
it
would
buy
locomotives
and
rail
cars
to
add
an
additional
bpd
of
crude
by
rail
capacity
it
expects
the
first
trains
to
be
running
by
december
with
all
online
by
august
crude
by
rail
will
narrow
the
differential
but
not
as
much
as
pipelines
the
most
effective
solution
is
production
cuts
but
they
are
not
universally
popular
with
producers
canadian
natural
resources
ltd
and
cenovus
energy
inc
have
voluntarily
curtailed
production
in
recent
weeks
but
other
majors
like
suncor
energy
inc
and
husky
energy
inc
which
have
refineries
and
are
therefore
sheltered
from
the
worst
of
the
price
impact
do
not
want
to
cut
output
dealing
with
the
low
crude
prices
is
essential
for
notley
who
faces
an
election
no
later
than
the
end
of
may
her
party
faces
a
tough
challenge
from
the
united
conservative
party
led
by
jason
kenney
a
former
cabinet
minister
with
the
federal
conservatives
