several
oil
companies
in
canada
pushed
back
on
monday
against
alberta
s
mandated
cuts
in
crude
production
warning
about
excessive
government
intervention
even
as
the
discount
on
canadian
crudes
narrowed
sharply
on
the
curtailment
plan
alberta
premier
rachel
notley
said
on
sunday
the
government
would
force
producers
to
cut
output
by
percent
or
barrels
per
day
bpd
until
excess
crude
in
storage
is
reduced
the
move
is
unusual
for
a
market
economy
like
canada
in
comparison
with
members
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
whose
oil
companies
are
often
prices
for
canadian
grades
of
crude
oil
moved
sharply
upward
monday
narrowing
the
deep
discounts
they
had
been
trading
at
relative
to
their
counterparts
while
producers
said
they
would
comply
with
the
mandatory
cuts

integrated
producers

expressed
disappointment
we
believe
the
market
is
working
and
view
curtailment
or
other
interventions
as
possibly
having
serious
negative
investment
economic
and
trade
consequences
said
husky
in
a
statement
however
major
producers
like
cenovus
energy
inc
and
canadian
natural
resources
ltd
were
vocal
with
their
support
at
or
differentials
the
lion
s
share
of
companies
in
this
industry
are
barely
breaking
even
or
actually
losing
money
cenovus
chief
executive
alex
pourbaix
said
in
an
interview
canada
is
one
of
the
world
s
largest
oil
producers
supplying
more
than
million
barrels
a
day
but
wcs
prices
slumped
in
october
to
a
discount
of
more
than
a
barrel
below
wti
due
to
the
transportation
constraints
and
storage
glut
heavy
western
canadian
select
oil
traded
at
a
a
barrel
discount
to
crude
on
monday
compared
with
a
discount
on
friday
light
synthetic
crude
from
the
oil
sands
settled
at
below
the
benchmark
narrower
than
friday
following
the
cuts
pourbaix
said
cenovus
expects
discounts
closer
to
a
barrel
in
supporting
investment
of
c
billion
billion
in
in
line
with
capital
spending
that
would
not
have
been
the
case
if
the
government
hadn
t
take
action
pourbaix
said
suncor
is
assessing
the
impact
of
the
government
s
announcement
it
said
noting
that
the
market
is
the
most
effective
means
to
balance
supply
and
demand
and
normalize
differentials
less
economic
production
was
being
curtailed
and
differentials
were
narrowing
as
a
result
of
market
forces
suncor
said
in
a
statement
adding
that
specific
effects
from
the
cuts
will
be
discussed
in
its
upcoming
outlook
imperial
oil
ceo
rich
kruger
said
the
company
was
reviewing
the
impact
on
its
investments
but
cnrl
cheered
the
alberta
government
s
move
noting
these
are
unprecedented
times
and
they
call
for
urgent
nexen
a
subsidiary
of
cnooc
ltd
said
the
actions
would
help
strengthen
the
alberta
economy
canada
s
production
has
steadily
increased
over
the
last
year
and
is
set
to
grow
some
percent
through
according
to
the
canadian
association
of
petroleum
producers
but
shipments
have
been
constrained
by
the
lack
of
pipelines
out
of
alberta
to
the
united
states
and
overseas
markets
several
projects
including
transcanada
corp
s
keystone
xl
to
the
united
states
and
the
expansion
of
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
to
the
west
coast
have
been
hamstrung
by
battles
with
opponents
the
action
is
a
remedy
but
not
solution
said
michael
tran
commodity
strategist
at
rbc
capital
markets
rail
cars
aside
there
s
no
solution
that
does
not
involve
building
a
the
mandated
cuts
are
controversial
because
heavily
integrated
producers
like
suncor
and
husky
benefit
from
the
low
crude
prices
to
feed
their
refineries
they
also
tend
to
have
more
secure
pipeline
access
producers
that
don
t
have
refineries
and
were
having
to
place
their
barrels
on
the
spot
market
without
pipeline
capacity
are
the
ones
that
are
really
benefitting
from
this

shares
of
companies
like
cenovus
and
canadian
natural

that
lack
refining
capacity
rose
while
shares
of
some
companies
with

fell
