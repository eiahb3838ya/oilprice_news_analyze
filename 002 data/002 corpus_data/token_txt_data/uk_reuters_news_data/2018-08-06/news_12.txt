world at risk of heading towards irreversible 'hothouse' state
london
reuters
the
world
is
at
risk
of
entering
hothouse
conditions
where
global
average
temperatures
will
be
degrees
celsius
higher
even
if
emissions
reduction
targets
under
a
global
climate
deal
are
met
scientists
said
in
a
study
published
on
monday
the
report
comes
amid
a
heatwave
that
has
pushed
temperatures
above
fahrenheit
in
europe
this
summer
causing
drought
and
wildfires
including
blazes
in
greece
in
july
that
killed
people
around
countries
agreed
in
to
limit
temperature
rise
to
well
below
above
levels
a
threshold
believed
to
be
a
tipping
point
for
the
climate
however
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
world
s
climate
can
be
safely
parked
near
above
levels
or
whether
this
might
trigger
other
processes
which
drive
further
warming
even
if
the
world
stops
emitting
greenhouse
gases
the
research
said
currently
global
average
temperatures
are
just
over
above
the
period
and
rising
at
each
decade
scientists
from
the
stockholm
resilience
center
the
university
of
copenhagen
australian
national
university
and
the
potsdam
institute
for
climate
impact
research
said
it
is
likely
that
if
a
critical
threshold
is
crossed
several
tipping
points
will
lead
to
abrupt
change
such
processes
include
permafrost
thaw
the
loss
of
methane
hydrates
from
the
ocean
floor
weaker
land
and
ocean
carbon
sinks
the
loss
of
arctic
summer
sea
ice
and
the
reduction
of
antarctic
sea
ice
and
polar
ice
sheets
these
tipping
elements
can
potentially
act
like
a
row
of
dominoes
once
one
is
pushed
over
it
pushes
earth
toward
another
said
johan
rockström
of
the
report
published
in
the
proceedings
of
the
national
academy
of
sciences
and
executive
director
of
the
stockholm
resilience
centre
it
may
be
very
difficult
or
impossible
to
stop
the
whole
row
of
dominoes
from
tumbling
over
places
on
earth
will
become
uninhabitable
if
hothouse
earth
becomes
the
reality
he
said
maximizing
the
chances
of
avoiding
such
a
hothouse
state
requires
more
than
just
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
the
report
said
for
example
improved
forest
agricultural
and
soil
management
biodiversity
conservation
and
technologies
that
remove
carbon
dioxide
from
the
atmosphere
and
store
it
underground
are
needed
commenting
on
the
research
some
experts
said
uncontrolled
warming
is
still
uncertain
but
not
implausible
in
the
context
of
the
summer
of
this
is
definitely
not
a
case
of
crying
wolf
raising
a
false
alarm
the
wolves
are
now
in
sight

phil
williamson
climate
researcher
at
the
university
of
east
anglia
