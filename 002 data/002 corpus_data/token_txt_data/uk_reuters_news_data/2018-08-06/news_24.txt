when
a
glacial
lake
burst
in
pakistan
s
northern
province
in
july
sher
baz
watched
helplessly
as
the
waters
swept
away
his
family
home
residents
of
badswat
village
which
lies
in
ishkoman
valley
at
the
foot
of
the
hindu
kush
mountain
range
s
peaks
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
flash
flood
that
carried
off
homes
roads
and
bridges
as
well
as
crops
and
forest
thank
god
we
are
alive
but
everything
we
owned
was
washed
away
by
the
floods
when
the
glacial
lake
burst
said
baz
a
old
father
of
four
although
there
are
several
glaciers
near
badswat
village
residents
said
this
was
the
first
glacial
outburst
in
living
memory
the
authorities
said
the
timely
evacuation
of
villagers
meant
nobody
had
died
baz
said
the
event
had
left
him
feeling
stranded
surrounded
by
mountains
and
muddy
water
it
seems
we
are
living
between
life
and
death
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
pakistan
has
more
glaciers
than
any
other
country
outside
the
polar
region
more
than
in
the
karakoram
himalayan
and
hindu
kush
ranges
according
to
the
pakistan
meteorological
department
pmd
they
feed
the
indus
river
system
the
country
s
water
lifeline
but
data
gathered
over
the
last
years
shows
that
all
but
about
of
the
glaciers
exhibit
signs
of
melting
due
to
rising
temperatures
meteorological
officials
said
as
the
glaciers
retreat
they
leave
behind
lakes
supported
by
ice
dams
or
accumulations
of
rock
and
soil
inherently
unstable
these
dams
often
burst
sending
huge
volumes
of
water
rushing
into
the
villages
below
them
with
glaciers
melting
faster
than
before
we
feel
more
vulnerable
and
it
seems
like
we
are
under
constant
threat
of
a
natural
disaster
said
another
villager
shakoor
baig
while
he
is
used
to
coping
with
floods
the
farmer
said
he
had
not
seen
anything
on
this
scale
baig
who
lost
his
home
crops
and
fields
joined
nearly
residents
in
badswat
village
who
were
evacuated
to
higher
ground
where
some
are
living
in
temporary
shelters
trapped
between
mountains
receding
waters
and
damaged
roads
providing
residents
with
enough
food
and
tents
has
been
difficult
said
local
relief
group
the
aga
khan
agency
for
habitat
which
worked
with
the
pakistani
army
to
aid
such
events
are
just
the
start
said
glacier
expert
and
pmd
head
ghulam
rasul
the
disasters
caused
by
glacier
outbursts
in
these
areas
will
not
stop
here
they
will
continue
in
the
future
because
there
are
so
many
glaciers
at
risk
of
bursting
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
years
of
deforestation
combined
with
climate
change
have
led
to
a
spike
in
temperatures
in
the
region
which
has
caused
glaciers
to
melt
rasul
said
over
the
past
years
he
said
the
average
temperature
in
has
increased
by
degree
celsius
compared
to
a
rise
of
degree
celsius
in
the
regions
of
sindh
punjab
and
poor
government
management
of
forests
and
increased
demand
for
timber
have
seen
trees
cut
down
he
said
even
though
conserving
forests
is
essential
in
order
to
absorb
carbon
emissions
and
fight
climate
change
global
warming
has
direct
implications
on
mountainous
areas
in
northern
pakistan
because
of
forest
loss
deforestation
happened
due
to
the
negligence
of
authorities
since
people
would
cut
trees
for
construction
and
fuel
rasul
said
the
essential
thing
to
do
is
to
grow
more
forests
to
mitigate
the
effects
of
global
warming
on
glaciers
in
local
authorities
said
rejuvenating
the
forest
is
a
priority
but
replenishing
the
area
would
take
time
the
provincial
government
has
already
launched
a
campaign
to
grow
the
forest
among
other
solutions
to
offset
the
rapid
increase
in
temperatures
in
these
mountains
local
government
spokesman
faizullah
faraq
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
with
help
from
the
international
fund
for
agricultural
development
ifad
faraq
said
the
authorities
were
also
developing
infrastructure
in
nearby
areas
in
case
residents
of
vulnerable
villages
were
forced
to
relocate
this
is
a
big
challenge
and
not
a
matter
to
resolve
overnight
but
we
are
moving
in
that
direction
he
said
rasul
said
the
pmd
had
installed
early
warning
systems
in
three
areas
to
notify
vulnerable
communities
of
any
glacial
threats
adding
that
more
were
needed
so
to
provide
sufficient
advance
warning
ahead
of
the
next
event
and
he
said
the
pmd
recommends
that
communities
be
better
trained
in
coping
with
emergency
situations
meantime
all
that
villager
baz
can
do
he
said
was
pray
that
his
family
would
survive
another
day
i
worry
about
the
future
and
how
to
feed
my
family
since
i
lost
my
land
and
my
job
ended
too
i
pray
that
god
will
save
us
from
more
natural
disasters
