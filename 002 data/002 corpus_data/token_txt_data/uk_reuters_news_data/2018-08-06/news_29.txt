analysis-friendship no more: how russian gas is a problem for germany
berlin
reuters
for
decades
the
friendship
pipeline
has
delivered
oil
from
russia
to
europe
heating
german
homes
even
in
the
darkest
days
of
the
cold
war
but
a
new
pipeline
that
will
carry
gas
direct
from
russia
under
the
baltic
sea
to
germany
is
doing
rather
less
for
friendship
driving
a
wedge
between
germany
and
its
allies
and
giving
chancellor
angela
merkel
a
headache
for
president
donald
trump
nord
stream
is
a
horrific
pipeline
that
will
increase
germany
s
dependence
on
russian
energy
ukraine
fighting
separatists
fears
the
new
pipeline
will
allow
moscow
to
cut
it
out
of
the
lucrative
and
strategically
crucial
gas
transit
business
it
comes
at
an
awkward
time
for
merkel
with
the
fraying
of
the
transatlantic
alliance
and
an
assertive
russia
and
china
she
has
acknowledged
that
germany
must
take
more
of
a
political
leadership
role
in
europe
the
global
order
is
under
pressure
merkel
said
last
month
that
s
a
challenge
for
us
germany
s
responsibility
is
growing
germany
has
more
work
to
in
april
she
accepted
for
the
first
time
that
there
were
political
considerations
to
nord
stream
a
project
she
had
until
then
described
as
a
commercial
venture
most
european
countries
want
germany
to
do
more
to
project
european
influence
and
protect
eastern
neighbors
that
are
nervous
of
russian
encroachment
but
letting
russia
sell
gas
to
germany
while
avoiding
ukraine
does
the
opposite
depriving
kiev
of
transit
revenues
and
making
it
poland
and
the
baltic
states
more
vulnerable
to
cuts
in
gas
supplies
the
price
would
be
an
even
greater
loss
of
trust
from
the
baltics
poland
and
ukraine
said
roderich
kiesewetter
a
merkel
ally
on
the
parliamentary
foreign
affairs
committee
we
germans
always
say
that
holding
the
west
together
is
our
center
of
gravity
but
the
russian
approach
has
succeeded
in
dragging
germany
at
least
in
terms
of
energy
policy
out
of
this
western
many
analysts
say
the
business
case
for
nord
stream
is
thin
another
pipeline
already
links
russia
and
germany
under
the
baltic
nord
stream
will
double
capacity
but
future
demand
is
uncertain
on
the
flip
side
german
industry
likes
anything
that
will
provide
energy
more
cheaply
merkel
s
social
democrat
coalition
partners
the
leading
voices
in
germany
calling
for
a
conciliatory
approach
towards
russia
are
also
in
favor
the
issue
has
divided
berlin
s
political
class
the
parties
agreed
in
their
coalition
talks
earlier
this
year
to
make
a
commitment
to
the
pipeline
but
did
not
put
it
in
writing
according
to
margarita
assenova
an
analyst
at
the
centre
for
european
policy
analysis
who
is
critical
of
nord
stream
russia
can
double
gas
exports
to
europe
via
existing
ukrainian
pipelines
without
building
the
new
conduit
but
despite
opposition
from
european
partners
from
washington
and
from
within
merkel
s
party
nord
stream
continues
germany
s
diplomatic
ambitions
are
being
thwarted
by
the
project
s
brutal
business
logic
on
the
other
hand
it
has
the
strong
backing
of
gazprom
russia
s
energy
giant
which
owns
nord
stream
ag
the
project
company
its
boss
matthias
warnig
once
an
east
german
spy
tasked
with
reporting
on
west
german
business
is
seen
as
one
of
berlin
s
most
formidable
lobbyists
the
pipeline
is
one
of
a
network
of
projects
seemingly
designed
to
circumvent
ukraine
the
largest
and
most
troublesome
of
the
countries
once
ruled
from
moscow
they
include
turk
stream
which
crosses
the
black
sea
to
bypass
ukraine
to
the
south
lawmakers
say
warnig
has
responded
to
their
skeptical
queries
about
the
project
by
promising
to
take
their
concerns
direct
to
russian
president
vladimir
putin
adding
to
the
sense
that
the
pipeline
serves
the
kremlin
s
strategic
interests
but
for
gazprom
it
makes
sense
transit
across
a
country
with
which
russia
is
in
an
undeclared
war
is
risky
and
increasingly
unreliable
as
ukraine
s
pipelines
grow
older
germany
and
the
european
union
are
attempting
to
broker
an
agreement
between
moscow
and
kiev
to
keep
the
gas
flowing
across
ukraine
when
the
current
transit
contract
ends
in
critics
say
this
means
european
consumers
will
pay
a
subsidy
to
help
keep
ukraine
afloat
in
the
spd
sympathy
for
nord
stream
runs
deep
gerhard
schroeder
the
party
s
last
chancellor
was
appointed
to
senior
positions
at
russian
energy
companies
after
leaving
office
and
regards
putin
as
a
close
friend
for
many
of
schroeder
s
generation
cooperation
with
russia
is
in
the
tradition
of
the
ostpolitik
of
their
hero
chancellor
willy
brandt
who
defied
a
skeptical
washington
to
reach
out
to
the
soviet
bloc
now
seen
as
a
prelude
towards
ending
the
cold
war
but
a
younger
generation
in
the
party
often
critical
of
schroeder
s
links
to
the
kremlin
is
more
cautious
germany
is
bound
to
russia
by
decades
of
cooperation
on
energy
supply
but
it
has
to
offer
something
to
its
western
allies
too
officials
say
that
cooperation
goes
a
long
way
last
week
merkel
hosted
russia
s
foreign
minister
sergei
lavrov
in
berlin
he
was
accompanied
by
russian
general
staff
chief
valery
gerasimov
who
has
been
banned
from
the
eu
since
russia
annexed
crimea
from
ukraine
in
keeping
lines
open
to
the
kremlin
is
popular
in
germany
where
polls
show
people
are
towards
russia
than
in
almost
any
country
increasingly
though
officials
wonder
if
germany
is
not
paying
too
high
a
price
in
lost
face
