late
one
billion

enough
to

about

was
the
latest
victory
for
the
sierra

told

voiding
two
federal

others
challenged
decisions

the
fish

issued
an
incidental
take
statement
under

the
company
to
build
the
pipeline
in
areas
inhabited
by
threatened
or
endangered

including
mussels
bumble
bees

bats
the

wants
fish

wildlife
to
put
more
limits
on
how
the
company
deals
with
the
animals
in
a
portion
of
the
pipeline
s
route
in
west
virginia
and
miles
in
virginia
dominion
said
it
will
avoid
those
areas
until
the
agency
clarifies
the
limits
which
the
company
expects
shortly
the
court
wants
the
national
park
service
to
better
explain
why
permitting
a
pipeline
to
cross
under
the
blue
ridge
parkway
in
virginia
is
consistent
with
the
conservation
and
preservation
purpose
including
scenic
views
of
a
national
highway
dominion
said
it
expects
the
park
service
to
provide
