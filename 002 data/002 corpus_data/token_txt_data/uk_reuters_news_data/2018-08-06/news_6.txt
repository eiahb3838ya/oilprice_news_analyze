saying
in
germany
and
other
countries
including
the

france

there

the

the

critical

it
security
we
want
to
take
a
closer
look
in

it
quoted
german
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
as
saying
until
now
we
ve
only
been
able
to
make
checks
when
at
least
percent
of
a
company
s
shares
have
been
acquired
now
we
want
to
lower
this
threshold
so
we
can
review
more
acquisitions
in
sensitive
economic
sectors
he
added
altmaier
said
germany
still
wanted
companies
to
invest
in
germany
but
added
attentiveness
where
such
investment
affects
national
security
interests
was
part
of
the
social

economy
last
week
the
german
government
signaled
it
was
prepared
to
use
a
new
power
to
veto
foreign
takeovers
of
german
companies
in
the
case
of
a
chinese
bid
for
toolmaker
leifeld
that
came
after
leifeld
s
majority
owner
georg
koffler
said
china
s
yantai
taihai
had
dropped
its
attempt
to
buy
the
company
ahead
of
an
expected
veto
by
the
german
government
last
month
a
german
state
bank
bought
a
stake
in
grid
operator
to
prevent
china
s
state
grid
acquiring
the
shareholding
and
promised
to
consider
ways
of
better
protecting
companies
from
foreign
acquisition
the
head
of
germany
s
domestic
intelligence
service
has
also
said
that
chinese
state
actors
seeking
trade
secrets
could
be
behind
bids
that
nominally
came
from
private
firms
highlighting
a
seeming
correlation
between
a
decline
in
hacking
attempts
originating
from
china
with
an
increase
in
bids
