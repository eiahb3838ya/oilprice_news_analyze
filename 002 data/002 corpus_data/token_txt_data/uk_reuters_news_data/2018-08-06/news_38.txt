asian
stocks
rose
on
monday
after
china
s
central
bank
took
steps
to
try
to
drag
the
yuan
away
from
lows
but
the
conflict
over
trade
hung
heavily
on
markets
the
people
s
bank
of
china
late
on
friday
raised
the
reserve
requirement
on
foreign
exchange
forward
positions
making
it
more
expensive
to
bet
against
the
chinese
currency
the
move
boosted
the
australian
dollar
which
is
often
played
as
a
liquid
proxy
for
the
yuan
the
aussie
came
off
lows
to
climb
as
high
as
after
the
announcement
and
was
last
at
analysts
say
the
step
by
the
pboc
will
be
generally
positive
for
asian
assets
leaning
against
bearish
cny
sentiment
is
important
because
a
rapidly
weakening
currency
risks
triggering
residential
outflows
and
destabilising
domestic
asset
prices
jpmorgan
analysts
said
in
a
note
our
economists
think
that
pboc
likely
will
take
further
action
if

they
were
helped
by

although
gains
were
capped
by
worries
over
the
escalating
trade
tensions
china
s
finance
ministry
proposed
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
goods
on
friday
while
a
senior
chinese
diplomat
cast
doubt
on
prospects
of
talks
with
washington
to
resolve
the
bitter
trade
conflict
that
was
followed
by
a
report
in
china
s
state
media
saying
friday
s
retaliatory
tariffs
were
rational
while
accusing
the
united
states
of
blackmail
at
the
same
time
president
donald
trump
said
his
strategy
of
placing
steep
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
is
working
far
better
than
anyone
ever
anticipated
citing
losses
in
china
s
stock
market
he
predicted
the
market
could
go
up
dramatically
once
trade
deals
were
renegotiated
our
economists
consider
that
escalation
in
tension
may
bring
the
and
china
back
to
the
negotiation
table
but
that
even
if
negotiations
are
resumed
a
bumpy
and
lengthy
process
is
likely
to
ensue
as
the
two
sides
remain
very
far
apart
jpmorgan
