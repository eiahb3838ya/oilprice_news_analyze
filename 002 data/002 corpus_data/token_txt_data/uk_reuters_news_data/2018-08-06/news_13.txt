iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
dismissed
a
call
for
talks
on
monday
hours
before
washington
was
due
to
impose
new
sanctions
in
line
with
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
pull
out
of
a
agreement
over
iran
s
nuclear
programme
washington
has
said
the
only
way
iran
could
avert
the
sanctions
would
be
to
agree
to
new
negotiations
to
abandon
its
missile
and
nuclear
programmes
in
a
televised
address
rouhani
said
there
could
be
no
talks
as
long
as
washington
was
reneging
on
the
deal
if
you
stab
someone
with
a
knife
and
then
you
say
you
want
talks
then
the
first
thing
you
have
to
do
is
remove
the
knife
rouhani
said
we
are
always
in
favour
of
diplomacy
and
talks
but
talks
need
honesty
rouhani
said
trump
s
call
for
direct
talks
is
only
for
domestic
consumption
in
america
ahead
of
elections
and
to
create
chaos
in
european
allies
tried
and
failed
to
persuade
trump
not
to
walk
out
of
the
agreement
under
which
iran
agreed
to
curbs
on
its
nuclear
programme
in
return
for
the
lifting
of
international
sanctions
rouhani
said
washington
would
come
to
rue
a
move
that
had
been
rejected
by
other
countries
america
will
regret
imposing
sanctions
on
iran
they
re
already
isolated
in
the
world
they
are
imposing
sanctions
on
iranian
children
patients
and
the
nation
he
said
the
prospect
of
sanctions
has
already
hurt
iran
s
economy
with
the
rial
currency
falling
this
year
and
the
government
cracking
down
on
protests
rouhani
called
on
iranians
to
unite
in
the
face
of
hardship
there
will
be
pressure
because
of
sanctions
but
we
will
overcome
this
with
unity
he
said
the
trump
administration
argues
that
the
curbs
did
not
go
far
enough
and
it
wants
to
force
iran
back
to
the
negotiating
table
iran
says
that
by
abandoning
the
agreement
washington
has
shown
it
can
not
negotiate
in
good
faith
last
month
trump
said
that
he
would
be
willing
to
meet
rouhani
without
preconditions
to
discuss
how
to
improve
relations
senior
iranian
officials
and
military
commanders
have
rejected
trump
s
offer
of
talks
as
worthless
and
a
dream
saying
his
words
contradicted
his
action
of
reimposing
sanctions
