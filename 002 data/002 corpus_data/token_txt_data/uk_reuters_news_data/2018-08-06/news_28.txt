the
trade
dispute
remains
a
live
issue
for
markets
with
china
proposing
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
goods
on
friday
while
a
senior
chinese
diplomat
cast
doubt
on
prospects
of
talks
with
washington
to
resolve
the
bitter
trade
conflict
that
was
followed
by
a
report
in
china
s
state
media
saying
friday
s
retaliatory
tariffs
were
rational
while
accusing
the
united
states
of
blackmail
at
the
same
time
president
donald
trump
said
his
strategy
of
placing
steep
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
is
working
far
better
than
anyone
ever
anticipated
citing
losses
in
china
s
stock
market
he
predicted
the
market
could
go
up
dramatically
once
trade
deals
were
renegotiated
the
drip
feed
of
escalating
tariff
threats
from
trump
and
counter
threats
from
china
continues
said
shane
oliver
chief
economist
at
amp
capital
with
a
percent
tariff
on
some
chinese
imports
likely
to
commence
soon
trump
is
clearly
ramping
up
the
pressure
on
china
but
china
is
digging
in
oliver
added
a
tariff
of
this
magnitude
will
start
to
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
china
s
growth
potentially
knocking
up
to
percent
off
growth
and
probably
also
on
the
at
the
same
time
china
is
stepping
up
measures
to
support
its
currency
which
has
been
hit
by
the
worsening
trade
skirmish
late
on
friday
the
people
s
bank
of
china
raised
the
reserve
requirement
on
some
foreign
exchange
forward
positions
making
it
more
expensive
to
bet
against
the
chinese
currency
and
helping
pull
the
yuan
away
from
lows
the
move
boosted
the
australian
dollar
which
is
often
played
as
a
liquid
proxy
for
the
yuan
the
aussie
came
off
lows
to
climb
as
high
as
after
the
announcement
and
was
last
at
leaning
against
bearish
cny
sentiment
is
important
because
a
rapidly
weakening
currency
risks
triggering
residential
outflows
and
destabilising
domestic

prices

other

investors
