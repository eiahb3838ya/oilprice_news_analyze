return
for
iran
curbing
its
nuclear
program
caused
a
run
on
the

bought
hard
currency
to
protect
themselves
from
the
looming
economic
sanctions

rates
allowing

sell
at
unofficial
market
rates
for
purposes
such
as
overseas
travel

the

hemmati
said
the
central
bank
would
allow
a
managed
float
of
the
rial
s
exchange
rate
and
try
to
avoid
using
up
its
reserves
to
support
the
currency
the
central
bank
will
try
not
to
interfere
in
setting
the
price
of
hard
currencies
which
will
be
determined
by
supply
and
demand
however
the
bank
s
supervision
will
prevent
unbridled
market
swings

the
creation
of
a
black
market
