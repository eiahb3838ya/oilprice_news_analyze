reuters
an
assassination
attempt
and
protest
in
azerbaijan
s
second
city
have
sent
a
warning
to
the
ruling
elite
that
discontent
is
simmering
in
the
tightly
controlled
state
police
have
arrested
a
local
man
over
the
attack
in
which
elmar
veliyev
mayor
of
the
northwestern
city
of
gyanja
was
shot
and
wounded
in
front
of
his
office
on
july
interior
ministry
officials
say
the
suspect
yunis
safarov
has
ties
to
a
militant
group
that
wants
to
establish
islamist
rule
in
azerbaijan
a
secular
state
where
most
people
are
shi
ite
muslims
and
that
he
trained
with
militants
in
syria
they
have
cited
no
sources
for
the
information
but
some
gyanja
residents
challenge
the
ministry
s
version
of
events
they
suggest
safarov
was
motivated
by
revenge
for
what
they
see
as
veliyev
s
mistreatment
of
gyanja
residents
and
disrespect
for
their
religious
views
in
a
rare
outbreak
of
violence
against
officialdom
in
the
south
caucasus
nation
two
police
officers
were
stabbed
to
death
in
clashes
when
a
protest
over
safarov
s
arrest
and
unofficial
reports
that
he
was
beaten
in
custody
turned
violent
on
july
a
third
samir
bayramov
was
wounded
azerbaijan
a
majority
muslim
country
of
about
million
has
grown
wealthy
from
oil
and
natural
gas
since
it
declared
independence
from
the
soviet
union
in
protests
are
rare
and
are
put
down
quickly
but
while
money
has
flowed
into
sprucing
up
baku
opponents
of
president
ilham
aliyev
say
few
have
seen
major
benefits
from
the
oil
wealth
especially
people
outside
the
capital
and
accuse
his
government
of
suppressing
human
rights
and
stifling
democracy
drawing
parallels
with
aliyev
they
accuse
veliyev
of
treating
gyanja
like
a
personal
fief
showing
no
regard
for
the
city
s
poor
and
being
with
anyone
who
stands
in
his
way
veliyev
has
been
behaving
exactly
the
same
way
as
aliyev
does
jakhangir
amirkhanly
a
member
of
the
opposition
musavat
party
told
reuters
in
gyanja
the
unrest
was
brief
and
there
is
no
sign
of
it
spreading
aliyev
who
succeeded
his
father
heydar
aliyev
as
president
in
brooks
little
dissent
and
the
opposition
is
weak
the
municipal
authorities
in
gyanja
said
in
an
emailed
response
to
reuters
questions
that
criticism
of
veliyev
was
groundless
and
but
the
events
in
the
city
show
that
with
the
economy
heavily
dependent
on
the
energy
sector
and
the
wealth
gap
now
huge
azerbaijan
s
leaders
could
face
a
growing
challenge
to
retain
power
in
the
long
term
if
oil
prices
fall
deeply
entrenched
elites
and
rulers
in
other
countries
in
the
region
are
watching
closely
kazakhstan
russia
and
turkmenistan
all
have
economies
that
are
reliant
on
energy
and
leaders
who
are
nervous
about
any
signs
of
unrest
europe
is
also
watching
because
of
its
energy
reserves
and
strategic
location
along
the
caspian
sea
azerbaijan
is
seen
by
europe
as
an
important
alternative
to
russian
energy
supplies
and
bp
is
a
major
investor
in
the
country
aliyev
has
shown
his
concern
by
taking
charge
of
the
investigation
into
the
events
in
gyanja
which
he
has
described
as
acts
of
terrorism
and
crimes
against
azeri
statehood
aimed
at
intimidating
society
the
authorities
also
showed
their
nervousness
by
trying
to
stop
news
of
the
protest
spreading
city
residents
said
for
two
days
afterwards
mobile
telephone
data
services
were
turned
off
in
gyanja
making
it
hard
to
access
social
media
they
said
some
had
used
facebook
to
circulate
information
about
the
events
and
the
prosecutor
s
office
has
opened
criminal
cases
against
the
editors
of
four
independent
azeri
websites
that
their
entries
gyanja
a
city
of
has
been
administered
for
seven
years
by
veliyev
a
member
of
the
ruling
party
who
was
appointed
by
aliyev
police
say
four
people
accused
of
links
to
radical
religious
organisations
were
killed
in
sting
operations
after
the
assassination
attempt
and
protest
in
addition
have
been
arrested
and
charged
and
others
are
wanted
by
police
but
of
gyanja
residents
who
agreed
to
speak
to
reuters
about
the
events
eight
doubted
the
assassination
attempt
had
any
link
to
militant
islamists
and
said
they
believed
veliyev
who
is
a
muslim
was
attacked
because
he
was
unpopular
none
wanted
to
be
identified
for
fear
of
reprisals
except
amirkhanly
though
azeri
officials
deny
western
charges
of
repressing
and
intimidating
opponents
we
were
shocked
that
someone
dared
to
take
a
gun
and
shoot
the
mayor
a
pensioner
said
in
a
gyanja
park
lowering
her
voice
and
looking
round
to
make
sure
no
one
was
eavesdropping
but
honestly
no
one
was
particularly
worried
because
veliyev
did
a
lot
of
bad
things
in
our
city
the
rich
became
richer
and
the
poor
became
beggars
she
said
the
city
administration
in
gyanja
defended
veliyev
s
record
in
office
in
response
to
reuters
questions
the
attack
is
just
a
terrorist
act
it
s
not
connected
to
any
particular
motives
revenge
or
response
to
the
supposed
social
tyranny
by
veliyev
it
said
construction
work
has
been
carried
out
in
the
city
the
authorities
have
had
meetings
with
city
residents
listened
to
their
complaints
and
dealt
with
them
roads
and
some
old
buildings
have
been
repaired
in
gyanja
shopping
malls
have
been
built
and
a
ramada
plaza
hotel
has
been
erected
the
city
centre
is
dominated
by
a
vast
park
named
after
heydar
aliyev
who
was
president
from
until
but
amirkhanly
said
unemployment
is
very
high
and
the
majority
of
young
residents
of
gyanja
emigrate
to
russia
or
an
pensioner
who
declined
to
be
named
said
he
had
been
tricked
by
the
city
authorities
into
leaving
his
flat
in
a
building
while
it
was
repaired
the
authorities
reneged
on
a
promise
to
pay
for
his
and
others
temporary
accommodation
and
are
now
trying
to
persuade
them
to
cede
ownership
of
the
flats
to
a
construction
firm
that
wants
to
demolish
them
and
build
on
the
site
he
said
the
pensioner
said
he
had
managed
to
meet
veliyev
to
petition
him
over
the
property
but
the
mayor
was
very
rude
the
mayor
s
office
did
not
respond
directly
to
the
pensioner
s
remarks
but
said
it
had
no
evidence
of
elmar
veliyev
having
an
unlawful
attitude
towards
citizens
aliyev
s
supporters
say
he
has
brought
stability
to
azerbaijan
modernised
the
country
and
forged
closer
ties
with
europe
since
succeeding
his
father
in
he
won
a
fourth
successive
term
in
april
with
more
than
percent
of
votes
but
the
election
was
boycotted
by
the
main
opposition
and
its
legitimacy
was
questioned
by
independent
observers
signs
of
public
anger
have
flared
in
recent
years
protests
in
baku
in
by
crowds
demanding
aliyev
and
his
government
quit
ended
after
a
security
crackdown
and
mass
arrests
in
protests
broke
out
in
at
least
three
cities
quba
siyazan
and
shabran
over
rising
bread
prices
and
a
sharp
devaluation
of
the
manat
currency
as
oil
prices
fell
police
responded
with
widespread
arrests
residents
said
the
unrest
in
gyanja
has
also
been
contained
there
is
no
organised
opposition
political
force
in
the
country
that
can
compete
with
the
ruling
elite
said
ilgar
velizade
an
independent
political
analyst
but
the
authorities
should
draw
some
lessons
from
the
recent
events
and
reconsider
their
personnel
policies
pay
more
attention
to
social
problems
and
communicate
more
with
a
sovereign
wealth
fund
has
been
set
up
to
ease
the
pain
of
any
economic
downturn
foreign
donors
have
also
urged
baku
to
diversify
the
economy
to
make
it
less
dependent
on
oil
and
gas
which
make
up
about
percent
of
state
revenues
there
is
little
sign
of
it
doing
so
with
the
government
expecting
percent
growth
this
year
after
only
percent
in
and
a
percent
contraction
in
the
status
quo
may
suit
the
west
as
stability
helps
it
implement
global
energy
projects
in
the
region
velizade
said
the
european
union
s
efforts
to
reduce
reliance
on
russian
gas
depend
partly
on
developing
the
southern
gas
corridor
which
is
expected
by
to
bring
about
billion
cubic
metres
of
gas
a
year
to
europe
via
georgia
and
turkey
from
azerbaijan
