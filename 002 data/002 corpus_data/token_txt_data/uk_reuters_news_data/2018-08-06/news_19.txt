president
donald
trump
claims
that
his
tariffs
on
trade
are
working
big
time
but
this
ignores
signs
that
the
best
hope
the
united
states
had
for
boosting
exports
to
china
is
being
crushed
as
beijing
clamps
down
on
energy
imports
one
of
trump
s
stated
aims
in
launching
tariffs
against
chinese
imports
was
to
lower
the
trade
deficit
between
the
united
states
and
china
which
is
in
the
region
of
billion
a
year
the
trump
administration
has
imposed
tariffs
on
billion
of
annual
trade
with
china
with
billion
more
due
to
be
implemented
in
coming
days
china
has
matched
the
billion
and
proposed
charges
on
billion
more
in
a
potentially
massive
escalation
trump
has
threatened
to
impose
tariffs
on
over
billion
of
chinese
goods
virtually
all
of
china
s
annual
exports
to
the
united
states
tariffs
are
working
big
time
trump
said
in
a
tweet
on
sunday
every
country
on
earth
wants
to
take
wealth
out
of
the
always
to
our
detriment
i
say
as
they
come
tax
the
latest
chinese
response
included
proposed
tariffs
on
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
the
fuel
now
joins
crude
oil
certain
refined
products
and
coal
on
the
list
of
imports
that
may
be
slapped
with
duties
of
up
to
percent
in
some
ways
the
addition
of
lng
to
the
list
is
symbolic
it
s
already
clear
that
chinese
companies
have
dramatically
scaled
back
their
purchases
of
energy
products
china
imported
about
barrels
per
day
of
crude
in
the
first
six
months
of
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
oil
research
and
forecasts
at
about
a
barrel
this
was
worth
just
below
billion
giving
a
potential
annual
trade
of
around
billion
that
may
sound
like
small
change
in
the
overall
context
of
trade
with
china
but
crude
oil
represented
one
of
the
few
areas
where
china
could
have
realistically
increased
its
purchases
from
the
united
states
china
was
also
the
biggest
market
for
crude
producers
representing
about
percent
of
total
exports
while
for
china
imports
were
a
measly
percent
of
the
total
it
s
likely
that
crude
exporters
will
be
able
to
find
other
buyers
but
they
may
have
to
offer
discounts
or
other
incentives
to
build
market
share
while
crude
exports
to
china
appear
to
have
held
up
in
august
with
about
bpd
expected
to
arrive
they
seem
set
for
a
slump
in
september
so
far
about
bpd
have
been
booked
for
arrival
next
month
according
to
data
and
the
window
for
more
cargoes
to
be
added
is
closing
given
it
takes
at
least
three
weeks
for
a
tanker
to
make
the
journey
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
china
s
east
coast
unipec
the
trading
arm
of
china
s
largest
refiner
sinopec
has
suspended
crude
imports
from
the
united
states
reuters
reported
on
citing
three
sources
familiar
with
the
situation
it
is
not
clear
how
long
the
temporary
halt
will
last
but
one
of
the
sources
said
unipec
has
no
new
bookings
of
crude
until
at
least
october
lng
was
another
product
where
the
united
states
had
real
potential
to
boost
exports
to
china
something
trump
touted
before
launching
his
trade
war
china
has
overtaken
south
korea
to
become
the
world
s
number
two
importer
of
the
fuel
behind
japan
rapid
growth
is
likely
to
continue
as
beijing
continues
to
implement
measures
largely
aimed
at
reducing
the
burning
of
coal
china
s
imports
of
lng
were
about
million
tonnes
in
the
first
seven
months
of
year
according
to
data
representing
just
percent
of
total
purchases
of
million
tonnes
august
s
imports
are
likely
to
be
around
tonnes
with
two
vessels
heading
from
the
united
states
to
china
roughly
matching
the
two
cargoes
offloaded
in
both
june
and
may
but
well
below
this
year
s
peak
of
seven
in
january
no
cargoes
at
all
have
yet
been
booked
for
september
raising
the
possibility
that
china
s
imports
of
lng
will
drop
to
zero
even
though
any
tariff
action
still
has
to
be
implemented
similar
to
crude
oil
and
lng
coal
was
another
area
where
trump
could
have
made
a
difference
to
exports
to
china
china
isn
t
a
major
buyer
of
coal
importing
mainly
coking
coal
used
in
however
with
the
price
of
australian
thermal
coal
reaching
year
highs
above
a
tonne
exports
of
this
type
of
fuel
used
in
power
stations
would
have
been
competitive
instead
coal
exports
to
china
appear
to
be
trending
lower
with
about
tonnes
booked
for
arrival
on
four
vessels
in
august
down
from
the
peak
this
year
of
tonnes
on
seven
ships
in
april
and
also
below
the
average
of
tonnes
for
the
first
seven
months
of
the
year
as
yet
no
cargoes
for
september
delivery
have
been
booked
although
this
may
change
since
some
coal
is
exported
from
long
beach
in
california
meaning
it
has
a
shorter
journey
time
of
around
three
weeks
to
reach
china
overall
what
the
data
is
showing
is
that
chinese
imports
of
energy
are
heading
lower
even
ahead
of
potential
tariffs
