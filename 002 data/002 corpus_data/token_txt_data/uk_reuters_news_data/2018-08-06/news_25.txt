european
shares
struggled
on
monday
as
fears
of
the
escalating
trade
conflict
outweighed
the
boost
to
sentiment
from
chinese
authorities
intervention
last
week
to
shore
up
its
currency
disappointing
corporate
earnings
in
the
european
banking
sector
added
to
the
cautious
start
to
the
week
s
trading
chinese
state
media
launched
an
unusually
personal
attack
against
president
donald
trump
s
trade
policies
on
monday
saying
trump
s
trade
extortion
would
not
work
it
also
sought
to
reassure
investors
about
chinese
economic
strength
as
the
dispute
rattles
financial
markets
and
raises
deepening
worries
about
the
impact
on
the
real
economy
after
an
initial
rise
asian
shares
earlier
succumbed
to
selling
pressure
with
chinese
shares
sliding
into
negative
territory
european
shares
were
also
mixed
the
share
index
dropped
percent
while
germany
s
dax
fell
percent
and
france
s
cac
was
virtually
flat
down
percent
the
biggest
plunge
in
german
industrial
orders
in
nearly
added
to
pressure
on
german
stocks
the
weakness
in
european
shares
followed
a
more
than
percent
drop
in
the
chinese
index
and
shanghai
s
sse
composite
japan
s
nikkei
and
south
korea
s
kospi
index
also
dropped
the
msci
world
equity
index
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
edged
down
percent
in
his
latest
twitter
tirades
and
his
latest
appearances
in
front
of
his
supporters
the
president
has
indicated
something
akin
to
a
strategy
behind
his
trade
war
policy
commerzbank
said
the
trade
war
will
remain
in
place
regardless
of
how
much
the
chinese
cave
the
trade
dispute
remains
a
live
issue
for
markets
with
china
proposing
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
goods
on
friday
while
a
senior
chinese
diplomat
cast
doubt
on
prospects
of
talks
with
washington
to
resolve
the
bitter
trade
conflict
at
the
same
time
trump
said
his
strategy
of
placing
steep
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
is
working
far
better
than
anyone
ever
anticipated
citing
losses
in
china
s
stock
market
he
predicted
the
market
could
go
up
dramatically
once
trade
deals
were
renegotiated
the
people
s
bank
of
china
s
intervention
last
week
to
impose
a
reserve
requirement
on
foreign
exchange
forward
contracts
had
the
desired
impact
of
halting
the
slide
in
the
yuan
in
offshore
markets
the
chinese
currency
fell
percent
against
the
dollar
to
on
monday
but
was
well
away
from
the
weak
point
the
yuan
had
plumbed
last
week
the
yuan
has
been
one
of
the
main
casualties
from
the
trade
conflict
with
many
investors
speculating
that
the
pboc
was
happy
for
the
renminbi
to
weaken
to
counter
the
impact
of
tariffs
traders
saw
the
pboc
effort
as
an
attempt
by
chinese
authorities
to
show
they
wanted
stability
and
some
interpreted
it
as
a
conciliatory
move
to
nudge
the
americans
towards
the
negotiating
table
other
said
the
intervention
would
not
stop
further
yuan
weakness
with
washington
and
beijing
at
loggerheads
over
tariffs

robustly
supporting
synchronized
global
growth
that
had
underpinned
sentiment
towards
risk
assets
before
the
eruption
of
the
trade
dispute
markets
are
increasingly
nervous
about
whether
growth
may
have
peaked
investors
are
also
closely
watching
the
rising
value
of
the
dollar
slowing
global
economic
growth
and
the
risk
of
the
federal
reserve
tightening
interest
rates
too
quickly
and
dampening

economic
growth
