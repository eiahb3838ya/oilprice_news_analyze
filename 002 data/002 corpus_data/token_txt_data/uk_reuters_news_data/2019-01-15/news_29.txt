dragged
back
stocks
on
tuesday
while
britain
s
pound
hovered
near
a
high
ahead
of
a
crucial
parliamentary
vote
on
brexit
most
european
markets
started
in
good
spirits
after
attempts
by
washington
and
beijing
to
play
down
the
risks
associated
with
their
trade
war
and
sterling
s
bizarrely
positive
twist
on
the
looming
brexit
drama
but
things
began
to
wobble
when
german
reported
its
weakest
growth
in
five
years
and
then
wall
street
futures
flinched
as
jp
morgan
blamed
bond
market
volatility
for
fourth
quarter
profits
there
were
still
remnants
of
positive
sentiment
shanghai
and
hong
kong
stocks
had
gained
almost
percent
overnight
after
president
trump
talked
up
the
chances
of
a
china
trade
deal
and
chinese
officials
then
came
out
in
force
hinting
at
more
stimulus
for
their
slowing
economy
tokyo
had
risen
percent
on
return
from
holiday
too
and
seoul
ended
up
smartly
as
well
it
seems
like
a
coordinated
effort
between
the
and
china
said
saxo
bank
s
head
of
global
equities
strategy
peter
garnry
highlighting
how
the
federal
reserve
had
also
scaled
back
talk
of
multiple
rate
hikes
for
now
at
least
it
seems
to
be
working
he
added
given
that
china
s
plans
to
cut
some
taxes
showed
its
policymakers
were
starting
to
wake
up
to
its
problems
all
other
focus
was
largely
on
britain
s
brexit
gyrations
the
pound
barely
budged
at
and
was
up
percent
at
pence
per
euro
in
london
having
strengthened
steadily
in
recent
weeks
but
the
surface
calm
was
deceptive
worries
of
britain
plunging
out
of
the
eu
at
the
end
of
march
without
some
kind
of
transition
deal
appear
to
have
eased
but
with
may
potentially
facing
the
biggest
defeat
for
a
uk
government
plan
in
years
uncertainty
still
dominates
may
s
hopes
of
keeping
her
plan
alive
will
hinge
on
the
scale
of
her
expected
loss
avoiding
a
heavy
defeat
could
give
her
the
chance
to
ask
brussels
for
more
concessions
before
trying
to
get
the
plan
through
parliament
in
another
vote
but
a
humiliating
outcome
could
pressure
her
to
delay
britain
s
scheduled
march
eu
departure
date
and
potentially
open
up
other
options
ranging
from
a
second
referendum
the
dangerous
no
deal
path
or
even
a
general
election
we
are
recommending
our
clients
not
to
take
strong
positions
on
the
pound
or
the
equity
markets
garnry

the

around

the

german
economic

that
had
also
hurt

the
overall
impact
of
brexit
on
german
economic
growth
is
also
impossible
to
quantify

china

said
it
would
aim
to
achieve
a
good

in

in
a
signal
of

state

li
keqiang
as
saying
the
government
is
seeking
to
establish
conditions
helpful
to
meeting
this

kuramochi
