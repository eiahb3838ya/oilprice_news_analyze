mexico
s
economy
could
contract
in
january
due
to
a
slowdown
in
activity
caused
by
fuel
shortages
one
of
the
government
s
candidates
to
serve
on
the
central
bank
board
said
on
monday
jonathan
heath
one
of
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
s
nominees
for
the
bank
told
a
congressional
hearing
the
shortfalls
stemming
from
a
government
crackdown
on
rampant
fuel
theft
could
become
a
serious
risk
if
they
go
on
for
weeks
for
january
right
now
i
d
think
that
we
could
see
a
negative
rate
of
growth
heath
said
if
it
goes
on
beyond
february
march
who
knows
when
we
could
start
to
get
in
to
something
dangerous
and
then
i
would
be
more
if
it
s
a
problem
that
lasts
a
week
two
more
weeks
and
we
see
things
starting
to
work
themselves
out
i
think
the
effects
could
be
minimal
the
economist
added
industry
groups
say
the
economy
could
suffer
if
the
bottlenecks
in
supply
that
have
caused
long
lines
of
motorists
to
form
outside
gas
stations
across
mexico
are
prolonged
several
states
complained
they
were
given
no
warning
by
the
government
that
it
was
about
to
shut
down
major
pipelines
in
order
to
stop
the
theft
that
has
caused
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
losses
to
mexico
in
recent
years
the
government
launched
its
crackdown
on
theft
on
and
shortages
started
to
be
felt
about
a
week
later
