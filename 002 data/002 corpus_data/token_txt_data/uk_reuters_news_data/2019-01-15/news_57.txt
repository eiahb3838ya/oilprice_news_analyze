mexico
s
freight
transport
association
expects
a
contingency
plan
aimed
at
speeding
up
gasoline
distribution
that
began
over
the
weekend
to
help
ease
bottlenecks
at
terminals
where
fuel
inventories
have
been
accumulating
in
recent
weeks
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
s
crackdown
on
rampant
fuel
theft
has
caused
long
lines
of
angry
motorists
waiting
to
fill
up
their
tanks
since
a
handful
of
mexico
s
most
important
fuel
pipelines
were
closed
to
avoid
further
losses
the
switch
to
more
road
distribution
has
slowed
down
deliveries
to
gas
stations
as
crowded
fuel
terminals
owned
by
pemex
s
create
bottlenecks
with
tanker
ships
waiting
to
discharge
imports
at
several
ports
the
national
chamber
of
freight
transport
expects
faster
truck
loading
direct
deliveries
and
better
security
can
increase
fuel
distribution
by
road
to
percent
of
the
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
gasoline
diesel
and
jet
fuel
mexico
consumes
compared
with
a
current
average
of
about
percent
this
is
a
contingency
plan
for
using
existing
assets
to
achieve
a
larger
capacity
of
fuel
distribution
said
chamber
president
enrique
gonzalez
transporters
have
asked
pemex
to
speed
up
loading
at
terminals
to
a
maximum
of
four
hours
from
hours
currently
before
lopez
obrador
s
push
each
truck
would
spend
up
to
hours
at
pemex
s
distribution
centers
gonzalez
said
the
chamber
represents
companies
with
a
combined
fleet
of
fuel
trucks
capable
of
loading
up
to
liters
each
the
contingency
plan
also
contemplates
direct
delivery
from
terminals
to
gas
stations
without
passing
through
pemex
distribution
centers
large
convoys
of
gasoline
trucks
are
now
a
common
sight
along
mexican
highways
the
vehicles
are
given
a
military
escort
since
lopez
obrador
moved
thousands
of
soldiers
and
police
to
supervise
and
protect
refining
and
distribution
mexico
s
central
region
including
the
capital
has
been
most
affected
by
the
shortages
since
a
key
pipeline
from
pemex
s
salamanca
refinery
was
shut
in
late
december
some
bpd
of
gasoline
are
lost
due
to
theft
according
to
reuters
calculations
based
on
official
data
the
problem
caused
a
billion
loss
for
pemex
last
year
lopez
obrador
s
offensive
against
gasoline
robbers
marks
his
first
attempt
to
tackle
entrenched
corruption
since
taking
office
on
as
of
the
number
of
tankers
waiting
to
discharge
imported
fuel
at
mexican
ports
grew
to
compared
with
at
the
end
of
last
week
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
data
that
represents
a
of
about
million
barrels
gasoline
imports
which
represent
of
the
country
s
consumption
typically
dip
in
january
due
to
lower
demand
but
shipments
so
far
this
year
have
declined
even
more
than
usual
as
drawing
down
inventory
is
running
slower
total
gasoline
imports
fell
to
bpd
in
the
first
nine
days
of
january
down
by
a
quarter
versus
the
same
period
last
year
according
to
clipperdata
traders
say
the
fall
in
imports
is
due
to
less
purchases
by
pemex
which
is
struggling
to
transport
gasoline
from
congested
ports
and
terminals
but
also
by
less
private
imports
since
fuel
taxes
were
increased
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
