agriculture
losses
caused
by
mexico
s
ongoing
fuel
shortage
are
estimated
at
nearly
million
a
sector
leader
said
on
monday
and
overall
economic
growth
is
also
likely
to
be
hit
as
the
government
struggles
to
stabilize
gasoline
distribution
losses
of
at
least
billion
pesos
million
have
been
reported
by
major
farm
and
ranching
businesses
as
delayed
shipments
and
spoiled
supplies
have
accumulated
due
to
shortage
of
motor
fuels
that
are
required
to
transport
products
bosco
de

who
heads
mexico
s
national
farm
council
told
reuters
berries
avocados
and
tomatoes
are
vulnerable
and
have
relatively
short
shelf
lives
and
the
situation
will
worsen
if
fuel
supply
and
distribution
are
not
normalized
soon
de
la
vega
explained
in
the
next
days
if
this
issue
isn
t
resolved
i
think
we
will
have
a
serious
shortage
of
perishable
food
he
added
meanwhile
mexico
s
economy
could
contract
in
january
due
to
a
slowdown
in
activity
caused
by
the
fuel
shortage
late
last
month
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
began
cutting
supply
from
major
fuel
pipelines
that
have
been
tapped
for
years
by
thieves
a
move
that
has
led
to
long
lines
of
frustrated
motorists
waiting
hours
to
fill
their
tanks
criminal
groups
have
tapped
pipelines
and
stolen
tanker
trucks
carrying
diesel
and
gasoline
in
the
country
for
years
costing
the
government
billions
of
dollars
lopez
obrador
s
offensive
against
fuel
robbers
marks
the
leftist
s
first
attempt
to
tackle
entrenched
corruption
since
taking
office
on
jonathan
heath
one
of
lopez
obrador
s
nominees
to
serve
on
the
central
bank
board
told
a
congressional
hearing
on
monday
that
shortfalls
stemming
from
the
government
crackdown
on
fuel
theft
could
become
a
serious
risk
if
they
go
on
for
weeks
for
january
right
now
i
d
think
that
we
could
see
a
negative
rate
of
growth
heath
said
if
it
goes
on
beyond
february
and
march
who
knows
when
we
could
start
to
get
into
something
dangerous
and
then
i
would
be
more
if
it
s
a
problem
that
lasts
a
week
or
two
more
weeks
and
we
see
things
starting
to
work
themselves
out
i
think
the
effects
could
be
minimal
the
economist
added
industry
groups
say
the
economy
could
suffer
if
the
bottlenecks
in
supply
are
prolonged
several
states
complained
they
were
given
no
warning
by
the
government
that
it
was
about
to
shut
down
major
pipelines
in
order
to
stop
the
theft
that
has
caused
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
losses
to
mexico
in
recent
years
the
government
launched
its
crackdown
on
theft
on
and
traders
started
to
feel
the
crunch
about
a
week
later
