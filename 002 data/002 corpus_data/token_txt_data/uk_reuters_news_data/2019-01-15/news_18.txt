major
world
stock
markets
climbed
on
tuesday
helped
by
hopes
of
more
stimulus
for
china
s
economy
while
the
euro
declined
against

following
weak
german
economic
data
stocks
in

surged
almost

after

talked
up

trade
deal

chinese
officials
then
came
out
in
force
hinting
at
more
stimulus
for
their
slowing
economy
that
came
a
day
after
data
on
monday
showed
china
s
exports
unexpectedly
fell
the
most
in
two
years
in
december
while
imports
also
contracted
sharply
china
feels
some
pressure
to
at
least
keep
the
negotiations
going
and
that
could
be
enough
for
now
for
markets
to
have
an
idea
that
some
deal
is
possible
perhaps
in
a
couple
of
months
not
anytime
soon
