on
the
upstream
section

its
longest
river
the
yangtze
the
state
planning
agency
said
on
tuesday
hydropower
is
a
clean
and
renewable
source
of
energy
but
construction
in
southwest
china
has
sparked
accusations
of
damage
to
fragile
ecosystems
and
inadequate
compensation
to
thousands
who
have
lost
their
homes
as
concern
grows
over
the
social
and
environmental
costs
of
large
hydroelectric
dams
china
has
become
more
cautious
of
approving
new
projects
in
recent
years
great
importance
must
be
attached
to
environmental
protection
and
migrant
resettlement
work
during
the
construction
the
state
planner
the
national
development
and
reform
commission
said
in

the
lawa
hydroelectric
project
will
submerge

of
forest
and
farmland
on
the
jinsha
branch
of
the
yangtze
on
the
border
between
sichuan
and
tibet
the
project
is
envisaged
to
eventually
consist
of
four
turbines
with
a
total
capacity
of
megawatts
gigawatts
that
compares
with
china
s
total
hydropower
capacity
of
gigawatts
by
the
end
of
last
year
with
about
gw
contributed

an
industry

said
last
week
state
power
giant
huadian

include
billion
yuan
to
cover
the
costs
of
relocating

compensating
people
displaced

construction
industry
advocates
say
big
dams
are
the
most
efficient
way
of
bringing
electricity
to
remote
and
undeveloped
regions
and
china
has
promised
to
improve
the
way
it
compensates
displaced
residents

also
said
it
would
look
at
ways
of
using
the
new
project
to
boost
local
income
it
has
also
launched
a
campaign
to
clear
up
disordered
hydropower
on
the
yangtze

an
audit
last
