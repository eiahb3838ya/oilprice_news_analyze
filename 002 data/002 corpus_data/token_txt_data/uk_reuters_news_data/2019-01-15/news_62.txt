asian
shares
were
on
back
foot
on
tuesday
as
an
unexpected
drop
in
china
s
exports
heightened
worries
about
the
global
economy
while
the
british
pound
braced
for
a
showdown
in
parliament
over
the
government
s
brexit
plan
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
was
almost
flat
in
early
trade
while
japan
s
nikkei
fell
percent
after
a
market
holiday
on
monday
in
monday
s
session
on
wall

the

the
biggest
drag
coming
from
a

fall

sector
chipmakers
which
get
a
sizable
portion
of
their
revenue
from
china
took
a
hit
with
the
philadelphia
se
semiconductor
index
falling
percent
data
on
monday
showed
china
s
exports
unexpectedly
fell
the
most
in
two
years
in
december
while
imports
also
contracted
sharply
pointing
to
further
weakness
in
the
world
s
economy
in
and
deteriorating
global
demand
adding
to
the
gloom
were
weak
industrial
output
numbers
from
the
euro
zone
which
showed
the
largest
fall
in
nearly
three
years
the
weak
data
provided
a
reality
check
to
equity
markets
which
had
mounted
a
rally
since
late
last
year
propelled
in
part
by
hopes
washington
and
beijing
could
reach
a
deal
on
trade
to
avoid
further
hikes
in
tariffs
the
british
pound
is
likely
to
steal
the
limelight
later
in
the
day
as
the
britain
s
parliament
will
vote
on
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
brexit
deal
on
monday
may
urged
lawmakers
to
take
a
second
look
at
her
deal
ahead
of
a
vote
that
looks
set
to
reject
the
agreement
such
a
result
could
open
up
the
possibilities
of
a
wide
range
of
outcomes
from
a
disorderly
exit
from
the
union
to
a
reversal
of
brexit
markets
have
priced
in
a
rejection
of
may
s
plan
and
there
are
many
scenarios
after
that
still
i
d
think
the
most
likely
outcome
is
to
extend
the
march
deadline
of
brexit

the

the

year
of
around
