alaska

regulators
in
the
state
of
alaska
will
investigate
all
of
the
oil
and
natural
gas
wells
operated
by
bp
plc
at
its
prudhoe
bay
oil
field
after
the
release
of
a
small
amount
of
crude
oil
and
gas
from
a
well
that
had
earlier
been
shut
the
alaska
oil
and
gas
conservation
commission
aogcc
has
scheduled
a
hearing
to
assess
the
mechanical
integrity
of
prudhoe
bay
wells
operated
by
bp
exploration
alaska
the
agency
said
in
a
notice
issued
on
friday
last
month
s
leak
occurred
at
one
of
wells
that
bp
had
shut
in
following
a
much
bigger
release
oil
and
gas
then
the
most
recent
failure
detected
on
released
natural
gas
and
about
two
gallons
of
crude
oil
said
megan
baldino
spokeswoman
for
bp
exploration
alaska
inc
the
gas
release
was
brought
under
control
two
days
later
she
said
there
was
no
oil
released
to
the
tundra
and
no
one
was
injured
she
said
there
are
prudhoe
bay
wells
said
baldino
adding
that
the
company
is
cooperating
with
the
aogcc
s
investigation
bp
is
investigating
the
incident
to
determine
the
cause
we
are
cooperating
with
aogcc
s
request
for
more
information
she
said
in
an
email
on
monday
the
earlier
failure
in
april
caused
crude
oil
to
spray
over
a
roughly
acre
hectare
area
and
caused
natural
gas
to
vent
for
days
before
it
was
brought
under
control
that
well
failure
was
linked
to
permafrost
thaw
the
normally
frozen
soil
thawed
triggering
movement
that
pushed
the
well
up
to
feet
meters
breaking
a
pressure
gauge
that
previously
regulated
the
site
according
to
regulators
that
sparked
a
north
well
review
ordered
by
the
aogcc
in
the
end
bp
identified
and
shut
the
wells
that
because
of
an
outdated
and
flawed
design
in
the
aftermath
of
that
incident
aogcc
officials
concluded
that
the
permafrost
thaw
was
the
result
of
the
wells
design
flaw
not
to
climate
change
however
permafrost
in
prudhoe
bay
which
is
located
on
the
alaska
north
slope
region
above
the
arctic
circle
from
the
area
near
the
tundra
s
surface
to
the
depths
far
below
it
has
warmed
significantly
since
the
in
response
to
the
rising
temperatures
in
that
region
