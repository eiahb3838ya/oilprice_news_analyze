european
exports
of
gasoline
to
the
middle
east
and
asia
have
surged
so
far
in
january
as
high
inventories
in
the
atlantic
basin
and
a
drop
in
fuel
prices
sparked
around
the
world
profit
margins
for
distilling
crude
oil
into
gasoline
in
europe
have
held
near
a
low
since
late
october
after
global
demand
for
the

disappointed
during
the
peak

season
exports
from
europe
to
the
east
coast
traditionally
the
main
outlet
for
surplus
gasoline
dropped
in
the
second
half
of
leading
to
sharp
stock
builds
in
recent
days
however
bookings
to
carry
gasoline
and
blending
components
out
of
europe
to
the
middle
east
and
asia
have
shown
strong
signs
of
a
recovery
so
far
some
barrels
per
day
bpd
or
roughly
tonnes
of
gasoline
have
been
booked
out
of
europe
to
the
middle
east
in
january
according
to
data
intelligence
company
kpler
the
january
figure
which
is
expected
to
rise
further
already
represents
a
percent
increase
from
the
full
december
figure
according
to
the
data
middle
east
demand
has
been
strong
since
a
unit
at
abu
dhabi
s
bpd
ruwais
refinery
was
destroyed
in
a
fire
more
than
two
years
ago
the

is
expected
to
come
back
online
in
the
first
quarter

at
the
same
time
exports
to
china
of
reformate
a
component
blended
into
gasoline
in
order
to
increase
its
octane
content
surged
in
january
according
to
traders
around
six
tankers
carrying
roughly
tonnes
of
reformate
have
been
booked
out
of
europe
for
january
according
to
shipping
data
that
compares
with
no
deliveries
in
the
second
half
of
january
according
to
traders
most
gasoline
exports
from
europe
in
recent
months
headed
to
west
africa
where
nigeria
regularly
buys
large
volumes
as
flows
to
the
united
states
eased
exports
to
west
africa
however
came
to
a
near
standstill
in
recent
weeks
due
to
congestion
outside
ports
traders
said
the
arbitrage
from
europe
into
the
east
coast
isn
t
open
leaving
asia
and
the
middle
east
as
the
only
outlets
said
robert
campbell
head
of
global
oil
products
at
consultancy
energy
aspects
global
demand
has
been
surprisingly
weak
particularly
in
the
united
states
but
also
in
places
like
mexico
where
distribution
disruptions
led
to
a
drop
in
exports
he
added
global
inventories
of
gasoline
and
light
distillates
rose
sharply
in
recent
months
and
in
the
first
week
of
january
were
million
barrels
higher
than
a
year
ago
according
to
consultancy
fge
the
gains
were
driven
mostly
by
an
gain
in
stocks
in
the
united
states
european
gasoline
stocks
remain
close
