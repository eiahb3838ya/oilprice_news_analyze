sources
told

several
lna
units
had
moved
in
recent
days
from
benghazi
to
sabha
the
biggest
city
in
the
south
of
libya
that
lies
in
the
same
southwestern
region
as
el
sharara
libya
s
biggest
oilfield
el
sharara
more
than
km
miles
from
sabha
has
been
closed
since
december
due
to
a
protest
by
tribesmen
and
state
guards
demanding
salary
payments
and
development
in
the
area
it
was
not
immediately
clear
whether
the
lna
forces
were
headed
to
el
sharara
el
feel
oilfield
a
smaller
production
facility
in
the
area
has
not
been
affected
by
protests
haftar
has
become
a
major
player
in
libya
since
his
forces
seized
benghazi
in
after
a
battle
mainly
with
islamist
fighters
mustafa
sanalla
chairman
of
the
national
oil
company
has
said
he
would
not
reopen
the
bpd
el
sharara
field
without
a
new
security
arrangement
although
he
has
not
specified
what
that
should
be
noc
has
struggled
to
keep
national
oil
production
steady
because
armed
groups
or
tribesmen
have
often
forced
the
closure
of
el
sharara
and
other
oilfields
libyan
output
has
been
hovering
around
million
bpd
well
below
the
million
bpd
produced
before
the
uprising
that
toppled
muammar
gaddafi
and
plunged
the
nation
into
chaos
security
in
southern
libya
is
very
poor
given
its
remoteness
from
the
main
population
centres
on
the
northern
coast
and
the
overall
breakdown
of
law
and
order
since
the
region
has
frequently
experienced
clashes
between
tribes
and
armed
groups
