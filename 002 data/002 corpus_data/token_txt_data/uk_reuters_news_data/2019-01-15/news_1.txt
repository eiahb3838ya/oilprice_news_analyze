venezuela
s
congress
declared
president
nicolas
maduro
a
usurper
on
tuesday
and
the
government
indicated
its
support
for
an
opposition
leader
ratcheting
up
pressure
on
the
socialist
president
as
he
embarks
on
a
disputed
second
term
president
donald
trump
s
administration
was
considering
recognising
the
leader
of
the
congress
juan
guaido
as
the
country
s
legitimate
president
according
to
two
people
familiar
with
the
matter
white
house
aides
were
weighing
such
a
move
among
a
list
of
options
being
prepared
for
trump
in
response
to
the
latest
venezuela
developments
but
no
final
decision
had
been
made
one
of
the
people
told
reuters
maduro
was
inaugurated
on
under
an
avalanche
of
criticism
that
his
leadership
was
illegitimate
following
a
election
widely
viewed
as
fraudulent
with
countries
around
the
world
disavowing
his
government
the
united
states
and
many
latin
american
nations
say
maduro
has
become
a
dictator
whose
failed
policies
have
plunged
venezuela
into
its
worst
ever
economic
crisis
with
no
recovery
in
sight
maduro
says
that
a
economic
war
is
trying
to
force
him
from
power
vice
president
mike
pence
spoke
by
phone
on
tuesday
with
guaido
to
express
support
for
congress
as
the
only
legitimate
democratic
body
in
the
country
a
white
house
official
said
venezuela
s
congress
on
tuesday
also
approved
a
measure
asking
dozens
of
foreign
governments
to
freeze
bank
accounts
controlled
by
maduro
s
government
the
measure
calls
on
the
united
states
european
union
and
several
latin
american
governments
to
instruct
regulatory
agencies
to
prohibit
any
movement
of
liquid
assets
by
the
venezuelan
state
in
local
bank
the
united
states
and
eu
have
already
imposed
sanctions
that
limit
the
sale
of
venezuelan
government
debt
and
freeze
assets
belonging
to
maduro
and
a
number
of
his
top
officials
a
white
house
spokesman
asked
if
further
sanctions
were
in
the
pipeline
said
the
united
states
was
considering
all
diplomatic
political
and
economic
tools
in
its
arsenal
in
response
to
the
usurpation
of
power
by
the
illegitimate
maduro
the
supreme
court
which
has
been
in
conflict
with
the
legislature
since
the
opposition
took
congress
over
in
has
preemptively
invalidated
any
laws
passed
by
the
body
guaido
a
newcomer
on
the
national
scene
who
was
elected
to
head
congress
on
said
last
week
he
was
willing
to
replace
maduro
as
interim
president
if
he
had
the
support
of
the
military
with
the
aim
of
then
calling
free
elections
our
roadmap
is
clear
to
achieve
the
end
of
the
usurpation
via
national
unity
and
internal
and
external
pressure
guaido
wrote
in
an
in
the
washington
post
published
on
tuesday
in
washington
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
said
any
decision
to
recognise
guaido
would
be
complicated
by
the
fact
that
he
has
not
declared
himself
president
or
even
stated
an
intention
to
do
so
such
a
move
by
the
trump
administration
could
also
backfire
if
maduro
took
action
to
prevent
guaido
from
being
sworn
in
or
used
it
as
a
pretext
to
detain
him
again
there
would
also
be
the
question
of
how
to
deal
with
venezuela
s
diplomatic
personnel
in
washington
the
person
said
several
venezuelan
government
officials
have
said
guaido
should
be
arrested
for
treason
and
on
sunday
he
was
briefly
detained
by
intelligence
agents
diosdado
cabello
president
of
the
constituent
assembly
a
legislative
superbody
elected
in
that
gives
the
ruling
socialist
party
sweeping
powers
said
on
tuesday
the
opposition
in
congress
were
the
only
ones
trying
to
usurp
opposition
lawmakers
are
also
discussing
a
future
amnesty
for
government
officials
and
military
officers
who
reject
maduro
and
help
bring
about
a
return
to
democracy
the
measures
are
unlikely
to
be
enforced
in
the
short
term
the
country
s
top
military
commanders
pledged
loyalty
to
maduro
immediately
after
his
reporting
