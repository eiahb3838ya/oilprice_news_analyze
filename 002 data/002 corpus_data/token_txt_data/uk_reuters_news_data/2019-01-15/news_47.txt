update 1-norway supreme court hears snow crab case with implication for oil
oslo
reuters
norway
s
supreme
court
began
hearing
arguments
on
tuesday
on
whether
eu
ships
can
fish
for
snow
crab
off
arctic
islands
north
of
norway
without
permission
from
oslo
a
case
that
could
decide
who
has
the
right
to
explore
for
oil
in
the
region
at
stake
is
whether
the
snow
crab
whose
meat
is
considered
a
delicacy
by
gourmets
in
japan
and
south
korea
is
a
sedentary
species
living
on
the
seabed
or
a
fish
stock
that
moves
around
and
who
gets
to
decide
about
it
if
it
is
seen
as
a
sedentary
species
then
it
is
a
resource
belonging
to
the
continental
shelf
of
norway
if
the
eu
can
stake
a
claim
over
the
snow
crab
then
it
could
be
harder
for
oslo
to
secure
its
claim
over
potential
oil
and
gas
resources
the
question
of
the
snow
crab
is
a
proxy
for
oil
because
what
is
valid
for
the
snow
crab
is
valid
for
the
oil
industry
oeystein
jensen
a
senior
research
fellow
in
law
at
the
fridtjof
nansen
institute
in
oslo
told
reuters
the
verdict
is
expected
in
three
to
four
weeks
the
issue
arises
out
of
a
conviction
for
illegal
fishing
of
an
eu
fishing
vessel
the
senator
in
the
waters
off
the
remote
arctic
svalbard
archipelago
norway
which
is
not
a
member
of
the
eu
argued
successfully
in
a
lower
court
that
the
european
commission
does
not
have
the
right
to
issue
fishing
licenses
off
svalbard
over
which
norway
has
sovereignty
via
a
treaty
the
ship
s
owner
latvian
fisherman
peteris
pildegovics
is
appealing
that
ruling
to
the
supreme
court
and
seeks
to
assert
a
right
to
fish
for
snow
crab
off
svalbard
there
was
no
need
for
a
norwegian
license
pildegovics
told
reuters
we
followed
the
procedure
norwegian
authorities
were
kept
fully
pildegovics
estimated
the
loss
of
income
due
to
the
ship
s
ongoing
seizure
at
about
million
euros
a
year
norway
says
only
it
has
the
right
to
issue
fishing
license
for
snow
crab
the
united
nations
convention
on
the
law
of
the
sea
the
constitution
of
the
seas
is
clear
on
this
it
is
only
norway
as
a
coastal
state
that
can
give
permission
to
fish
on
the
norwegian
continental
shelf
foreign
minister
ine
eriksen
soereide
said
in
an
april
column
in
a
sign
of
the
importance
the
case
has
for
norway
a
panel
of
supreme
court
judges
a
higher
than
usual
number
will
listen
to
the
arguments
during
the
session
starting
on
tuesday
jensen
the
academic
said
that
according
to
international
law
it
is
only
coastal
states
that
can
grant
licenses
for
the
management
of
natural
resources
so
norway
via
svalbard
is
the
coastal
state
in
charge
he
said
now
the
svalbard
treaty
forces
norway
to
treat
all
signatories
fairly
the
eu
does
not
have
the
right
to
issue
licenses
but
the
treaty
perhaps
grants
the
eu
the
right
to
be
equally
treated
the
eu
by
issuing
their
own
licenses
has
ignored
these
steps
and
ignored
international
law
he
said
