china starts new recycling drive as foreign trash ban widens
shanghai
reuters
china
plans
to
launch
new
recycling
bases
by
the
end
of
next
year
part
of
a
campaign
to
make
better
use
of
its
resources
after
extending
a
ban
on
foreign
trash
imports
a
long
manufacturing
boom
has
saddled
china
with
millions
of
tonnes
of
waste
much
of
which
is
buried
in
sprawling
landfill
sites
or
dismantled
by
hand
in
polluting
backstreet
workshops
it
has
vowed
to
tackle
the
problem
by
creating
fully
industrialized
recycling
bases
and
cutting
off
foreign
supplies
large
volumes
of
solid
waste
are
already
impacting
and
restricting
the
development
of
the
industrial
economy
the
ministry
of
industry
and
information
technology
said
in
a
policy
document
issued
late
last
week
it
said
new
comprehensive
utilization
bases
would
deal
with
bulk
solid
waste
and
another
with
industrial
waste
from
sectors
such
as
metals
production
coal
mining
construction
agriculture
and
forestry
the
bases
will
tackle
waste
with
the
biggest
public
impact
the
ministry
said
citing
shared
bicycles
packaging
batteries
and
solar
panels
as
examples
they
will
also
promote
advanced
technologies
products
and
recycling
methods
it
added
projects
or
companies
approved
to
set
up
shop
in
one
of
these
new
bases
can
apply
for
special
government
funding
and
china
will
also
make
use
of
new
financing
mechanisms
including
green
bonds
the
document
added
china
s
recyclers
have
profited
from
waste
shipped
in
from
europe
and
the
united
states
which
is
better
sorted
and
therefore
cheaper
to
treat
than
domestic
material
imports
reached
million
tonnes
a
year
at
their
peak
but
the
government
has
been
steadily
blocking
shipments
since
the
initial
ban
on
types
of
imported
waste
including
plastic
and
paper
was
extended
at
the
end
of
to
new
products
including
scrap
ships
and
automobile
parts
it
said
in
december
that
it
would
also
ban
imports
of
more
varieties
of
scrap
steel
copper
and
aluminum
from
july
and
another
products
including
scrap
stainless
steel
and
titanium
will
be
blocked
at
the
end
of
the
year
total
solid
waste
imports
fell
percent
on
the
year
in
and
china
eventually
aims
to
block
all
imports
that
have
readily
available
domestic
replacements
many
domestic
recyclers
have
tried
to
move
their
facilities
to
southeast
asia
despite
tougher
restrictions
in
malaysia
and
elsewhere
and
while
some
have
started
to
switch
to
domestic
feedstock
china
still
needs
to
do
more
to
standardize
and
scale
up
the
treatment
of
local
waste
some
items
just
can
t
be
imported
anymore
including
plastics
but
domestic
waste
and
imports
are
handled
by
different
people
and
they
are
not
part
of
the
same
system
