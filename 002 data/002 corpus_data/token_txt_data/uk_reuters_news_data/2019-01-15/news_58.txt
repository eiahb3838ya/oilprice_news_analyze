the
indian

the

founder
and
chairman
old
naresh
goyal
was
likely
to
step
down
from
the
board
and
give
up
majority
control
goyal
s
penchant
for
control
according
to
people
who

said
goyal
was

putting

last
month
the
abu
dhabi
carrier
currently
owns
percent
in
jet
even
so
etihad
s
stake
will
be
capped
at
percent

foreign
ownership
rules
in
indian
airlines
once
its
stake
goes
past
percent
under
the
country
s
capital
markets
regulations
etihad
will
have
to
make
an
open
offer
to
shareholders
for
a
majority
of
the
shares
unless
it
obtains
a
rare
exemption
from
the
market
regulator
cnbc
citing
sources
reported
on
monday
that
goyal
would
trim
his
percent
stake
