in

the

politicians
are
in
a
quandary
over
whether
to
offer

risk
allowing

governor

newsom
a
democrat
told
reporters
late
on
monday
his
team
was
discussing
the
possibility
of
helping

stay
solvent
but
no
decisions
had
been
made

on

that

had
resigned

pg

which

electricity

to
million
customers
in
northern
and
central
california
faces
widespread
litigation
government
investigations
and
liabilities
that
could
potentially
exceed
billion
due
to
the
fires
its
chances
of
emerging
from
bankruptcy
proceedings
hinge
in
part
on
an
arcane
california
legal
rule
that
threatens
to
keep
it
perpetually
on
the
hook
for
liabilities
from
catastrophic
wildfires
the
doctrine
known
as
inverse
condemnation
exposes
utilities
in
the
state
to
liabilities
from
wildfires
regardless
of
their
negligence
as
long
as
their
equipment
is
involved
that
legal
rule
could
keep
pg
e
exposed
to
additional
liabilities
from
future
fires
and
leave
the
company
stuck
in
bankruptcy
limbo
according
to
restructuring
experts
and
people
familiar
with
the
matter
still
analysts
from
brokerage
morningstar
said
in
a
note
to
clients
that
this
was
one
of
the
rare
cases
where
shares
could
emerge
from
the
process
with
some
value
the
most
likely
scenario
is
a
accounting
charge
that
cuts
pg
e
s
book
equity
well
below
its
allowed
regulatory
capital
structure

said
our
new
fair
value
estimate
for

per

after
considering
possible

around

an
