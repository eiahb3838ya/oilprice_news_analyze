china

it

the

keqiang
as
saying
the
government
is
seeking
to
establish
conditions
helpful
to

this
year
s
economic
goals
that
came
after

china

also
contracted

shares
led
the

highest
since

december
while

in

weeks
it
is
interesting
that
cyclicals
are
leading
the
gains
today
it
appears
some
contrarian
investors
are
starting
to
buy
cyclicals

beyond
the
last
economic
slowdown

the
british

was
expected
to

the

later
in

day
as
the
britain

parliament
votes
on
the
proposed
brexit
deal
on
monday
may
urged
lawmakers
to
take
a
second
look
at

which
lawmakers
are

produce
a
wide
range
of
outcomes
from
a
disorderly
exit
from
the

to
a
reversal
of

markets
have
priced
in
a
rejection
of

there
are
many
scenarios

think
the
most
likely
outcome
is
to
