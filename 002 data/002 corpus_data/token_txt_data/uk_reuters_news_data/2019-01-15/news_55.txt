asian

pulled

on
tuesday
led
by
a
bounce
in
chinese
shares
as
beijing
signalled
more
supportive
measures
to
stabilise
a
slowing
economy
while
the

braced
for

it
will
aim
to
achieve
a
good
start
in
the
first
quarter
for
the

in
a
signal
of
more

state

also
quoted
chinese
premier
li
keqiang
as
saying
the
government
is
seeking
to
establish
conditions
helpful
to
meeting
this
year
s
economic
goals
that
came
after
data
on
monday
showed
china
s
exports
unexpectedly
fell
the
most
in
two
years
in
december
while
imports
also
contracted
sharply
pointing
to
further
weakness
in
the
world
s
economy
in
and
deteriorating
global
demand
cyclical
shares
led
the
gains
in
the
region
with
australian
financial
shares
hitting
highs
while
japanese
electronics
and
machinery
makers
shares
rose
to
their
highest
levels
in
nearly
four
weeks
it
is
interesting
that
cyclicals
are
leading
the
gains
today
it
appears
some
contrarian
investors
are
starting
to
buy
cyclicals
looking
beyond
the
last
economic
slowdown
said
nobuhiko
kuramochi
chief
strategist
at
mizuho
securities
s
futures
also
gained
percent
to
in
early
asian
trade
but
i
would
suspect
there
will
be
heavy
selling
if
we
go
up
further

around

in
the

kuramochi
added
in
monday
s
session
on

the

lost
percent
with
the
biggest
drag
coming
from
a
percent
fall
in
technology
sector
while
mounting
worries
about
escalating
trade
tensions
and
a
slowdown
in
the
global
economy
have
pummelled
global
stock
prices
since
last
october
cheap

are
helping

attract

on
a
positive
note

the

rose

bolstered
the

the
british
pound
is
likely
to
steal
the
limelight
later
in
the
day
as
the
britain
s
parliament
will
vote
on
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
brexit
deal
on
monday
may
urged
lawmakers
to
take
a
second
look
at
her
deal
ahead
of
a
vote
that
looks
set
to
reject
the
agreement
such
a
result
could
open
up
the
possibilities
of
a
wide
range
of
outcomes
from
a
disorderly
exit
from
the
union
to
a
reversal
of
brexit
markets
have
priced
in
a
rejection
of
may
s
plan
and
there
are
many
scenarios
after
that
still
i
d
think
the
most
likely
outcome
is
to
extend
the
march
deadline
of
brexit
