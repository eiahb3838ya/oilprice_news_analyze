some
of
the
fears
about
the

in

to
have
ebbed
away

the
market
is
latching
on
to
news
that
suggests
that
the
economy
may
be
better
than
china
s
national
development
and
reform
commission
offered
some
support
on
tuesday
signaling
it
might
roll
out
more
fiscal
stimulus
this
countered
negative
sentiment
from
monday
when
crude
prices
fell
more
than
percent
after
data
showed
weakening
imports
and
exports
in
china
however
both
oil
benchmarks
pared
gains
slightly
in
trade
after
british
lawmakers
defeated
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
brexit
divorce
deal
by
a
crushing
margin
triggering
political
upheaval
that
could
lead
to
a
disorderly
exit
from
the
european
union
or
even
to
a
reversal
of
the
decision
to
leave
parliament
voted
against
her
deal
raising
economic
uncertainty
that
weighed
on

fundamentally
output
cuts
from
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
other
producers
including
russia
have
begun
to
reduce
fears
of
oversupply
the
group
known
as
agreed
in
late
to
cut
supply
starting
this
month
seeking
to
rein
in
a
global
glut
have
set
a
meeting
for
march
to
to
monitor
implementation
of
their
pact
sources
told
reuters
and
another
meeting
on
april
to
to
decide
on
whether
to
extend
cuts
beyond
the
agreed
six
months
further
support
has
come
from
data
showing
the
number
of
rigs
drilling
for
new
oil
dipped
slightly
so
far
this
year
also
analysts
in
a
reuters
poll
ahead
of
weekly
industry
data
on
tuesday
and
a
government
report
on
wednesday
expected
crude
stockpiles
to
have
fallen
for
a
second
straight
week
the
rig
data
could
signal
a
slowing
of
the
swift
rise
in
output
from
the
united
states
which
became
the
world
s
top
oil
producer
in
in
the
longer
term
crude
output
is
expected
to
rise
to
a
new
record
of
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
this
year
and
to
climb
to
nearly
million
bpd
next
year

the
market
also
found
support
in
news
that
the
will
not
grant
further
waivers
to
its
sanctions
on
iran
special
representative
for
iran
brian
hook
said
on
saturday
that
washington
was
not
looking
to
grant
any
more
waivers
for
iranian
oil
after
the
reimposition
of
sanctions
the
move
could
limit
iranian
oil
coming
the
market
in
coming
months
such
positive
signals
and
hopes
for
renewed
talks
to
resolve
trade
tensions
have
boosted
world
stock
markets
and
oil
prices
but
fears
about
global
growth
weigh
heavily
it
would
seem
that
the
market
is
having
a
rather
hard
time
making
up
its
mind
as
to
which
story
to
believe
