played
second

to

on

as
a

in

fanned
speculation
the

might
be
done

tightening

its

oil
stole
the
show
as
a

of
supply
saw
crude
sink

overnight
while

was
last
changing
hands
at
a

having
hit
its
lowest
since
august
brent
s
percent
plunge
since
october
is
sending
a
disinflationary
pulse
through
the
world
at
a
time
when
trade
and
economic
activity
are
already
cooling
that
has
only
added
to
pressure
on
the
fed
to
abandon
its
commitment
to
yet
more
hikes
president
donald
trump
on
tuesday
warned
the
central
bank
not
to
make
yet
another
mistake
while
the
wall
street
journal
wrote
an
editorial
calling
for
a
pause
so
far
the
futures
market
is
sticking
with
a
chance
of
a
rate
increase
on
wednesday
despite
recent
market
volatility
we
think
that
it
is
still
more
likely
than
not
that
the
fed
will
raise
rates
said
anz
senior
economist
tom
kenny
but
we
lean
slightly
toward
the
fed
removing
the
reference
to
the
need
for
further
gradual
increases
he
also
expects
the
median
fed
forecast
or
dot
plots
to
drop
to
two
rate
rises
next
year
from
the
three
projected
back
in
september
the
market
is
well
ahead
of
that
and
pricing
in
less
than
one
rise
in
talk
of
a
dovish
turn
helped
wall
street
steady
and
the
dow
ended
tuesday
up
percent
the
s
p
edged
up
percent
and
the
nasdaq
percent
stocks
were
left
in
the
dust
by
bonds
as
treasury
yields
hit
their
lowest
since
august
at
percent
near
a
major
chart
level
at

fell
basis
points
to
a

of

a
massive
turnaround
from
november

peak
japanese
bond
futures
likewise
started
wednesday
at
their

since
august
reasons
for
the
rally
were
easy
to
find
the
latest
survey
of
fund
managers
globally
from
bofa
merrill
lynch
showed
the
third
biggest
decline
in
inflation
expectations
on
record
while
just
over
half
expected
the
world
economy
to
slow
next
year
investors
rushed
into
bonds
with
the
largest
ever
rotation
into
assets
while
cutting
equities
investors
are
close
to
extreme
bearishness
said
michael
hartnett
chief
investment
strategist
at
bofaml
all
eyes
are
on
the
fed
and
a
dovish
message
could
equal
a
bear
market
the
steep
drop
in
treasury
yields
undermined
one
of
the

s
major
props
and
pulled
its
index
back
to
from
a
recent
top
it
fell
to
yen
from
a
high
last
week
while
the
euro
nudged
up
to
from
a
low
in
commodity
markets
gold
held
near
its
recent
peak
as
the
