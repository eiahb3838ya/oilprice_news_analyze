nomads and farmers in fight for nigeria's heartland

nigeria
a
reuters
analysis
of
land
use
data
shows
how
a
massive
expansion
of
farming
in
nigeria
s
middle
belt
has
cut
access
to
grazing
land
for
nomadic
herders
and
fuelled
persistent
violence
if
the
coming
dry
season
in
nigeria
follows
the
pattern
of
previous
years
violence
will
soon
erupt
between
herders
in
search
of
water
for
their
cattle
and
farmers
determined
to
protect
their
land
in
the
past
authorities
have
blamed
the
violence
on
religion
or
ethnic
divisions
but
a
close
examination
of
the
changes
in
land
use
in
central
nigeria
shows
just
how
much
it
comes
down
to
a
simple
clash
over
resources
the
stakes
are
high
amnesty
international
said
the
violence
has
killed
more
than
people
since
most
of
them
this
year
clashes
between
herding
and
farming
communities
in
have
killed
more
people
than

geological
survey
data
the
analysis
of
data
released
publicly
only
in
shows
open
grazing
land
available
in
nigeria
s
middle
belt
declined
by
percent
between
and
while
the
area
dedicated
to
farming
nearly
trebled
that
means
less
land
for
nomads
to
feed
their
cattle
supporting
the
view
of
local
people
that
the
conflict
is
based
on
the
availability
of
land
rather
than
ethnic
or
religious
differences
the
shift
towards
farming
not
only
reflects
nigeria
s
rapid
population
growth
but
also
successive
governments
efforts
to
diversify
the
economy
away
from
its
heavy
reliance
on
oil
violence
involving
fulani
herders
and
farmers
from
other
ethnic
groups
has
been
widespread
since
but
most
frequent
in
nigeria
s
middle
belt
a
region
where
the
mostly
christian
south
converges
with
the
islamic
north

land
was
plentiful
it
made
up

in

made

while

in

the
trend
was
similar
across
all
of
nigeria
reuters
found
that
between
and
nigeria
s
middle
belt
lost
about
square
kilometres
of
land
available
to
herders
there
is
no
single
kilometre
you
go
through
without
seeing
farmland
unlike
what
used
to
happen
in
the
when
the
population
was
less
said
samuel
ortom
benue
state
governor
referring
to
the
impact
of
nigeria
s
growing
population
the
united
nations
predicts
it
will
reach
million
by
more
than
double
the
present
million
usgs
data
reveals
that
almost
half
of
the
square
km
that
changed
from
grazing
land
to
farmland
from
to
in
nigeria
was
in
the
middle
belt
the
central
states
make
up
about
one
third
of
nigeria
s
land
area
but
the
middle
belt
is
not
strictly
defined
add
another
km
around
the
borders
of
these
states
and
the
middle
belt
accounts
for
almost
of
the
nationwide
switch
from
grazing
land
to
farmland
many
of
the
farmers
are
christian
and
the
herders
are
mainly
muslim
but
locals
see
the
land
issue
as
paramount
it
s
a
competition
for
limited
land
it
s
not
about
ethnicity
or
religion
said
baba
othman
ngelzarma
national
secretary
of
the
miyetti
allah
cattle
breeders
association
of
nigeria
some
argue
that
laws
punish
the
herders
nomadic
way
of
life
which
can
be
seen
as
cattle
and
herders
traverse
the
middle
belt
s
roads
and
dusty
bush
paths
the
herders
are
usually
young
men
and
boys
some
as
young
as
herders
travel
by
foot
with
their
animals
usually
cows
they
can
walk
hundreds
of
kilometres
over
the
course
of
a
few
months
often
crossing
the
porous
borders
that
separate
nigeria
from
its
neighbours
benin
niger
and
cameroon
but
land
use
has
changed
even
if
herders
customs
have
not
the
boko
haram
insurgency
in
the
northeast
has
helped
to
push
herders
into
central
nigeria
say
analysts
while
changes
in
the
north
s
climate
also
encourage
nomadic
herdsmen
to
move
further
south
herders
start
to
move
out
as
fertile
land
turns
into
desert
because
of
and
drought
springs
and
streams
have
dried
up
across
the
far
northern
sahelian
belt
prompting
large
numbers
of
herders
to
seek
other
pastures
and
sources
of
water
for
their
cattle
in
the
savannah
of
nigeria
s
central
and
southern
states
farmers
say
their
crops
have
been
destroyed
by
the
herders
cattle
as
the
fight
over
fertile
land
has
intensified
so
too
have
disputes
over
crop
damage
water
pollution
and
cattle
theft
the
violence
between
herders
and
farmers
has
forced
thousands
to
flee
their
homes
and
huge
camps
have
sprung
up
in
benue
and
plateau
states
in
one
outbreak
of
violence
more
than
people
were
killed
during
a
weekend
in
june
we
were
just
cooking
before
we
knew
it
some
gunshots
from
nowhere
said
kangyan
dankye
a
resident
in
a
camp
in
plateau
describing
an
attack
on
her
home
by
herders
we
just
ran
away
said
dankye
who
lost
five
relatives
in
the
violence
