two
democratic
lawmakers
urged
the
department
of
homeland
security
on
wednesday
to
better
protect
oil
and
gas
pipelines
from
cyberattacks
after
a
report
they
requested
detailed
a
lack
of
federal
oversight
of
the
critical
conduits
the
report
released
on
wednesday
said
homeland
security
s
transportation
security
administration
or
tsa
does
not
have
a
process
to
update
its
pipeline
security
guidelines
to
reflect
revisions
to
standards
considered
by
experts
and
regulators
to
be
the
industry
bible
on
cybersecurity
the
standards
on
avoiding
hacker
attacks
are
the
cybersecurity
framework
from
the
national
institute
of
standards
and
technology
the
report
by
the
general
accountability
office
or
gao
the
investigative
arm
of
congress
was
requested
by
senator
maria
cantwell
and
representative
frank
pallone
protecting
our
pipelines
and
the
people
who
live
and
work
near
them
must
be
a
top
priority
for
our
government
and
i
hope
this
report
will
prompt
the
trump
administration
to
start
treating
this
challenge
with
the
urgency
it
deserves
cantwell
said
in
a
release
a
dhs
official
said
tsa
is
extremely
proud
of
its
work
on
pipeline
cybersecurity
which
has
included
the
publication
of
security
guidelines
information
sharing
and
analysis
of
pipeline
security
reviews
the
gao
issued
recommendations
for
the
tsa
including
implementing
a
process
for
reviewing
and
if
necessary
revising
security
guidelines
at
regular
intervals
dhs
agreed
with
all
the
recommendations
in
the
report
energy
infrastructure
has
long
been
a
target
of
hackers
last
week
hackers
using
a
variant
of
the
notorious
shamoon
virus
crippled
more
than
computers
owned
by
italian
oil
services
company
saipem
and
brought
down
servers
in
the
middle
east
and
india
the
company
did
not
know
who
conducted
the
strike
but
an
official
at
cybersecurity
company
crowdstrike
said
he
believed
iran
was
responsible
the
report
on
wednesday
found
tsa
relied
on
by
the
pipeline
industry
to
determine
whether
operators
have
critical
facilities
in
their
systems
that
could
be
the
target
of
hackers
that
is
a
classification
the
agency
uses
to
determine
calculations
about
the
vulnerability
of
pipelines
to
cyberattacks
as
a
result
operators
for
one
third
of
the
top
pipeline
systems
based
on
volume
told
the
tsa
they
did
not
have
critical
facilities
and
the
tsa
did
not
verify
the
it
said
the
report
also
said
tsa
had
not
tracked
the
status
of
security
review
recommendations
to
pipeline
operators
for
the
past
five
years
the
vulnerability
of
gas
pipelines
to
cyberattacks
has
been
one
argument
that
energy
secretary
rick
perry
a
republican
has
used
to
justify
asking
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
to
bail
out
aging
nuclear
and
coal
power
plants
which
do
not
depend
on
pipelines
cyber
experts
said
perry
s
plan
would
not
shield
the
grid
from
hackers
because
they
have
a
wide
array
of
options
for
hitting
electricity
infrastructure
ferc
an
independent
agency
of
the
department
of
energy
rejected
the
perry
directive
but
the
issue
could
come
up
again
