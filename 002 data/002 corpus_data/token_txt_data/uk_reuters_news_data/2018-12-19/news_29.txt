update 2-in no-deal brexit, eu seeks to avoid short-term crash
brussels
reuters
the
european
union
set
out
measures
on
wednesday
to
limit
disruption
to
air
traffic
financial
services
and
trade
if
britain
left
the
bloc
without
a
deal
next
march
however
in
a
sign
that
a
brexit
would
not
be
business
as
usual
there
would
be
new
checks
to
currently
frictionless
trade
which
could
lead
to
near
ports
and
delays
to
deliveries
every
shipment
of
live
animals
or
animal
products
from
britain
would
face
controls
at
eu
borders
and
britons
would
lose
the
right
to
travel
with
their
pets
using
eu
pet
passports
the
european
union
would
only
allow
british
trucks
to
carry
goods
into
the
bloc
assuming
also
britain
allowed
eu
trucks
in
until
the
end
of
next
year
the
european
commission
which
presented
the
plans
also
warned
of
higher
charges
for
using
credit
or
debit
cards
because
eu
rules
limiting
such
fees
would
no
longer
apply
asked
if
the
european
union
was
offering
britain
a
relatively
attractive
option
commission
vice
president
valdis
dombrovskis
told
a
news
conference
the
measures
were
simply
designed
to
limit
disruption
dombrovskis
said
that
the
best
way
to
avoid
harming
the
british
economy
would
be
for
britain
to
stay
in
the
european
union
in
the
case
of
brexit
the
withdrawal
agreement
agreed
with
the
british
government
was
better
than
no
deal
in
the
case
of
no
deal
doing
some
preparation
to
limit
damage
is
better
than
not
doing
any
preparation
at
all
he
said
the
commission
s
measures
cover
transport
financial
services
customs
and
border
checks
taxation
and
climate
change
and
will
need
to
be
backed
by
the
european
parliament
and
the
countries
remaining
in
the
eu
the
eu
executive
proposed
allowing
british
airlines
to
fly
to
and
from
eu
airports
for
months
assuming
britain
offered
equivalent
rights
to
eu
airlines
the
bloc
would
also
recognise
uk
clearing
houses
for
financial
derivatives
for
a
year
the
commission
which
is
coordinating
the
european
union
s
response
to
brexit
also
called
on
the
other
eu
governments
to
allow
british
nationals
living
in
their
countries
to
stay
and
work
from
march
the
day
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
commission
was
keen
to
stress
that
the
measures
were
limited
in
time
it
also
said
that
the
contingency
measures
would
not
apply
to
british
territory
gibraltar
which
has
an
active
financial
services
sector
