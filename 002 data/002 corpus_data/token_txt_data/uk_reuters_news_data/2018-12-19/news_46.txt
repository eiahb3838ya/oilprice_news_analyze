environmental
group
greenpeace
said
on
wednesday
it
could
halve
its
workforce
in
india
to
early
next
year
due
to
a
block
on
its
bank
account
after
accusations
of
illegal
donations
prime
minister
narendra
modi
s
nationalist
government
has
tightened
scrutiny
of
groups
over
the
past
four
years
it
says
they
often
act
against
india
s
interests
and
has
revoked
licenses
for
thousands
of
groups
known
for
its
campaigns
against
india
s
power
plants
greenpeace
has
been
barred
from
receiving
foreign
donations
since
the
enforcement
directorate
india
s
financial
crime
investigating
agency
froze
its
main
bank
account
on
greenpeace
which
denies
wrongdoing
said
it
only
had
funds
to
pay
employees
for
about
two
more
months
meaning
half
of
the
staff
of
locals
were
at
risk
of
losing
their
jobs
there
are
attacks
on
us
said
greenpeace
spokesman
nandikesh
sivalingam
blaming
the
coal
lobby
the
coal
industry
is
strong
and
powerful
even
if
governments
do
want
to
move
away
from
coal
including
for
climate
change
it
was
not
immediately
possible
to
contact
the
enforcement
directorate

finance
ministry
under
which
it
operates
declined
comment
asok

group
independent
power
producers
association
of
india
said
it
was
unfair
to
blame
power
producers
for
action
against
greenpeace
i
don
t
understand
this
opposition
to
coal
he
told
reuters
renewable
power
can
t
take
over
coal
for
many
many
years
fortunately
we
have
got
good
coal
reserves
and
we
should
use
since
modi
took
office
in
india
has
cancelled
registration
of
nearly
groups
under

critics
say
the
government
has
been
using
the
foreign

law
as
a
tool
to
silence
groups
which
have
raised
concerns
about
the
social
costs
of
india
s
rapid
economic
