the
environmental
protection
agency
granted
oil
major
exxon
mobil
corp
a
financial
hardship
waiver
this
year
temporarily
freeing
its
montana
refinery
from
biofuel
laws
three
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
exxon
which
reported
earnings
of
almost
billion
in
became
the
largest
known
company
to
be
awarded
a
such
a
waiver
by
the
trump
administration
s
epa
under
a
program
meant
to
protect
the
smallest
fuel
facilities
from
going
bust
farm
state
lawmakers
have
complained
that
the
hardship
waivers
are
being
overused
in
a
way
that
is
killing
demand
for
ethanol
and
they
were
likely
to
criticize
the
waiver
awarded
to
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
and
most
profitable
companies
the
renewable
fuel
standard
requires
refiners
to
blend
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
their
fuel
each
year
or
buy
compliance
credits
from
competitors
that
do
but
it
allows
the
epa
to
exempt
plants
of
less
than
barrels
per
day
if
they
show
complying
would
cause
financial
hardship
the
epa
has
vastly
expanded
the
program
under
president
donald
trump
but
is
reviewing
how
it
handles
further
requests
as
it
seeks
to
balance
the
competing
interests
of
refiners
and
ethanol
producers
exxon
s
waiver
was
granted
before
the
review
began
and
covers
its
refinery
in
billings
montana
for
the
compliance
period
said
the
sources
who
asked
not
to
be
named
epa
spokesman
michael
abboud
declined
to
comment
on
whether
the
refinery
received
a
waiver
but
pointed
out
that
the
waiver
program
requires
the
agency
only
to
consider
the
financial
situation
of
the
refinery
and
not
its
owner
this
was
a
decision
congress
made
when
drafting
the
renewable
fuel
standard
and
epa
implements
the
small
refinery
exemption
program
consistent
with
that
explicit
direction
he
told
reuters
in
an
emailed
statement
exxonmobil
declined
to
comment
reuters
reported
earlier
this
year
that
andeavor
and
chevron
both
large
and
highly
profitable
refiners
were
also
granted
recent
epa
exemptions
for
their
small
facilities
the
epa
keeps
the
identities
of
companies
receiving
waivers
secret
arguing
the
information
is
business
sensitive
but
the
agency
recently
began
publishing
the
numbers
of
exemptions
granted
it
said
it
awarded
exemptions
to
small
refineries
in
for
the
compliance
year
so
far
up
from
for
and
just
seven
for
the
epa
has
attributed
the
program
s
expansion
mainly
to
a
lawsuit
brought
by
two
oil
refiners
that
challenged
its
denial
of
their
waiver
requests
under
president
barack
obama
s
administration
a
federal
judge
ruled
last
year
the
epa
was
using
too
narrow
a
test
to
evaluate
applications
the
epa
which
relies
partly
on
advice
from
the
department
of
energy
has
asked
doe
to
review
its
scoring
system
for
applications
before
considering
additional
waiver
requests
biofuel
backers
have
argued
that
the
waiver
program
s
expansion
was
politically
driven
by
former
epa
administrator
scott
pruitt
a
supporter
of
the
fossil
fuels
industry
who
sought
ways
to
lower
compliance
costs
for
energy
companies
republican
senator
chuck
grassley
from
iowa
responded
to
the
news
with
a
call
for
an
overhaul
of
the
waiver
process
that
exxon
was
reportedly
granted
a
small
refiner
waiver
for
hardship
just
goes
to
show
how
abused
the
process
has
been
he
said
in
an
emailed
statement
there
s
no
good
reason
multibillion
dollar
oil
refining
giants
should
be
able
to
skirt
the
pruitt
resigned
amid
a
slew
of
ethics
scandals
last
july
and
has
been
replaced
in
the
interim
by
his
deputy
andrew
wheeler
trump
has
said
he
was
likely
to
nominate
wheeler
to
serve
as
the
permanent
epa
chief
that
would
require
senate
confirmation
and
several
powerful
senators
such
as
grassley
are
agitating
for
measures
to
protect
ethanol
demand
i
suspect
wheeler
would
be
more
invested
in
maintaining
the
reputation
of
the
agency
a
biofuels
industry
participant
said
asking
not
to
be
named
he
also
would
not
want
to
upset
people
who
will
have
a
say
