nigeria
s
president
muhammadu
buhari
presented
an
trillion
naira
billion
budget
for
on
wednesday
laying
out
plans
to
drive
growth
to
a
raucous
parliament
that
highlighted
divisions
two
months
before
an
election
the
spending
plan
for
africa

top
oil

assumes
crude
production
of
million
barrels
a

an
oil
price
of
per

buhari
s
handling
of
the
economy
which
emerged
from
its
first
recession
in
years
this
year
but
remains
sluggish
has
become
a
campaign
issue
the
main
opposition
candidate
businessman
and
former
vice
president
atiku
abubakar
has
criticised
policies
implemented
by
buhari
since
taking
office
in
and
vowed
to
double
the
size
of
the
economy
to
billion
by
if
elected
coming
months
after
dozens
of
lawmakers
defected
to
the
opposition
buhari
received
a
rowdy
reception
with
many
of
his
statements
greeted
by
jeers
and
chants
of
lies
while
supporters
at
times
stood
to
applaud
we
are
supposed
to
be
above
this
said
buhari
at
one
point
in
response
to
boos
buhari
said
trillion
naira
had
been
allocated
to
capital
spending
and
trillion
naira
for
debt
service
of
which
percent
was
domestic
debt
that
he
said
accounted
for
about
percent
of
the
total
debt
although
our
national
debt
is
within
sustainable
limits
we
need
to
increase
our
domestic
resource
mobilisation
to
bring
down
our
ratio
over
the
medium
term
he
said
the
spending
plan
is
smaller
than
the
record
budget
for
that
he
signed
into
law
in
june
the
budget
must
still
be
approved
by
parliament
a
process
that
can
take
months
previous
budgets
have
been
delayed
by
wrangling
and
next
year
there
will
be
the
added
complication
of
the
presidential
election
followed
by
gubernatorial
elections
weeks
later
the
proposal
is
unlikely
to
be
approved
before
february
s
election
meaning
that
both
the
assembly
and
buhari
himself
might
be
replaced
through
the
process
said
john
ashbourne
africa
economist
at
capital
economics
even
once
the
budget
is
finalised
it
may
not
prove
an
accurate
guide
to
actual
spending
he
said
adding
more
broadly
today
s
speech
underlined
the
fact
that
another
term
for
buhari
would
mean
policy
nigeria
s
economy
grew
by
percent
in
the
third
quarter
of
this
year
inflation
rate
rose
slightly
in
november
to
percent
compared
with
a
year
ago
