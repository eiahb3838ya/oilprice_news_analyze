project
in
the
history

operate
in
ina

biggest

is
hungary

mol

percent
under
the
investment
plan
the
sisak
refinery
will
be
turned
into
another

industrial
facility
the
sisak

offer
alternative
jobs
to
affected
workers
and
severance
payments
significantly
higher
than
the
croatian
average
workers
at
sisak
have
repeatedly
voiced
concerns
in
recent
years
about
mol
s
alleged
plans
to
shut
down
the
plant
putting
pressure
on
the
croatian
government
to
prevent
it
the
company
estimated
that
if
fully
implemented
its
plans
would
increase
average
yearly
core
profit
or
ebitda
by
more
than
one
billion
kuna
mol
and
the
croatian
government
have
been
at
odds
for
several
years
about
management
rights
and
investment
policy
at
ina
two
years
ago
the
zagreb
government
announced
it
intended
to
buy
back
ina
shares
from
mol
but
little
has
happened
since
croatian
prime
minister
andrej
plenkovic
recently
said
that
a
final
decision
would
depend
on
the
price
set
by
mol
in
the
first
nine
months
of
this
year
ina
s
revenues
were
billion
kuna
percent
more
than
in
the
same
period
last
year
ebitda
amounted
to
billion
kuna
roughly
the
same
as
in
the
first
nine
months
of
kuna
