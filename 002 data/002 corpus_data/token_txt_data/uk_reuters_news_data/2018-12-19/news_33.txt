exclusive-u.s. to offer 'black box' nuclear waste tech to other nations
washington
reuters
the
department
of
energy
s
nuclear
security
office
is
developing
a
project
to
help
other
countries
handle
nuclear
waste
an
effort
to
keep
the
united
states
competitive
against
global
rivals
in
disposal
technology
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
the
push
comes
as
the
united
states
struggles
to
find
a
solution
for
its
own
mounting
nuclear
waste
inventories
amid
political
opposition
to
a
permanent
dump
site
in
nevada
proposed
decades
ago
and
concerns
about
the
cost
and
security
of
recycling
the
waste
back
into
fuel
the
national
nuclear
security
administration
is
considering
helping
other
countries
by
using
technologies
that
could
involve
techniques
such
as
crushing
heating
and
sending
a
current
through
the
waste
to
reduce
its
volume
the
sources
said
the
machinery
would
be
encased
in
a
black
box
the
size
of
a
shipping
container
and
sent
to
other
countries
with
nuclear
energy
programs
but
be
owned
and
operated
by
the
united
states
according
to
the
sources
who
asked
not
to
be
named
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
matter
that
way
you
could
address
a
country
s
concerns
about
spent
fuel
without
transferring
ownership
of
the
technology
to
them
said
one
of
the
sources
the
nnsa
confirmed
a
project
to
help
other
countries
with
nuclear
waste
is
underway
but
declined
to
provide
details
we
are
in
the
conceptual
phase
of
identifying
approaches
that
could
reduce
the
quantity
of
spent
nuclear
fuel
without
creating
proliferation
risks
a
goal
with
significant
economic
and
security
benefits
nnsa
spokesman
dov
schwartz
said
the
effort
is
being
led
by
nnsa
deputy
administrator
for
defense
nuclear
nonproliferation
brent
park
a
nuclear
physicist
and
former
associate
lab
director
at
the
energy
department
s
oak
ridge
national
laboratory
appointed
by
president
donald
trump
in
april
the
nnsa
declined
a
reuters
request
for
an
interview
with
park
the
sources
did
not
name
countries
to
which
the
service
would
be
marketed
or
where
the
waste
would
be
stored
after
it
is
run
through
the
equipment
but
they
said
they
were
concerned
the
processes
under
consideration
could
increase
the
risk
of
dangerous
materials
reaching
militant
groups
or
nations
unfriendly
to
the
united
states
former
president
jimmy
carter
banned
nuclear
waste
reprocessing
in
because
it
chemically
unlocks
purer
streams
of
uranium
and
plutonium
both
of
which
could
be
used
to
make
nuclear
bombs
the
nnsa
s
schwartz
said
the
plans
under
consideration
do
not
involve
reprocessing
but
declined
to
say
what
technologies
could
be
used
the
sources
familiar
with
the
nnsa
s
deliberations
said
there
are
three
basic
ways
that
the
physical
volume
of
nuclear
waste
can
be
reduced
all
of
which
are
costly
at
least
one
of
the
techniques
poses
a
security
threat
they
said
the
first
called
consolidation
reduces
the
volume
of
nuclear
waste
by
taking
apart
spent
fuel
assemblies
and
crunching
the
waste
down
to
two
times
smaller
than
the
original
volume
an
approach
that
is
considered
costly
but
which
doesn
t
add
much
security
risk
a
second
technique
involves
heating
radioactive
pellets
in
spent
fuel
assemblies
the
process
which
gives
off
gases
that
must
be
contained
results
in
a
waste
product
that
has
more
environmental
and
health
risks
a
third
approach
called
pyroprocessing
developed
at
the
department
of
energy
s
argonne
national
laboratory
puts
spent
fuel
in
liquid
metal
and
runs
an
electric
current
through
it
that
reduces
volume
but
concentrates
plutonium
and
uranium
making
it
a
potential
proliferation
risk
the
nuclear
community
is
divided
on
whether
pyroprocessing
fits
the
definition
of
reprocessing
the
trump
administration
has
made
promoting
nuclear
technology
abroad
a
high
priority
as
the
united
states
seeks
to
retain
its
edge
as
a
leader
in
the
industry
amid
advancements
by
other
nations
like
russia
and
france
both
of
which
already
offer
customers
services
to
take
care
of
waste
reactor
builder
westinghouse
which
emerged
from
bankruptcy
in
august
and
is
owned
by
brookfield
asset
management
hopes
to
sell
nuclear
power
technology
to
countries
from
saudi
arabia
to
india
but
faces
stiff
competition
from
russia
s
rosatom
energy
secretary
rick
perry
visited
saudi
arabia
this
month
for
talks
on
a
nuclear
energy
deal
with
the
kingdom
despite
pushback
from
lawmakers
concerned
about
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
in
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
the
united
states
is
also
struggling
to
support
its
own
nuclear
industry
at
home
with
aging
reactors
shuttering
new
projects
elusive
due
to
soaring
costs
and
an
ongoing
political
stalemate
over
a
permanent
solution
for
mounting
nuclear
waste
stockpiles
the
united
states
produces
some
metric
tons
of
nuclear
waste
each
year
which
is
currently
stored
in
pools
or
in
steel
casks
at
the
nation
s
roughly
commercial
nuclear
power
plants
across
states
the
federal
government
designated
nevada
s
yucca
mountain
as
the
sole
permanent
nuclear
waste
repository
decades
ago
to
solve
the
problem
spending
about
billion
on
the
project
but
it
has
never
opened
due
to
local
opposition
thomas
countryman
the
state
department
s
top
arms
control
officer
during
the
obama
administration
said
the
government
should
make
headway
on
the
domestic
problem
before
helping
other
countries
the
primary
issue
on
this
front
is
not
that
the
can
t
offer
a
option
to
potential
buyers
rather
it
s
that
the
still
has
no
option
for
disposing
of
its
own
spent
fuel
he
said
edwin
lyman
a
nuclear
expert
at
the
union
of
concerned
scientists
said
nnsa
should
be
less
concerned
about
volume
of
waste
and
more
concerned
about
the
dangers
that
make
it
hard
to
store
it
s
not
the
volume
of
the
nuclear
waste
that
s
the
issue
but
the
radioactivity
and
heat
it
gives
off
as
well
as
the
fact
that
it
remains
dangerous
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
