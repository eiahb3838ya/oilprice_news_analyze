reuters
bulgarian
energy
holding
beh
said
on
wednesday
it
would
very
likely
appeal
the
hefty
fine
the
european
union
antitrust
regulators
slapped
on
it
for
blocking
rivals
access
to
key
gas
infrastructure
in
bulgaria
between
and
the
european
commission
fined
beh
million
euros
million
on
monday
saying
the
company
abused
its
market
dominance
to
hinder
competition
beh
s
gas
supply
unit
bulgargaz
and
its
gas
network
operator
bulgartransgaz
are
also
subject
to
the
fine
beh
and
its
units
denied
any
wrongdoing
and
said
they
believed
the
access
to
the
balkan
country
gas
network
and
its
gas
storage
facility
had
always
been
granted
in
line
with
the
law
they
also
said
the
imposed
fine
was
disproportionate
the
companies
will
carefully
look
at
the
decision
and
will
probably
appeal
it
by
challenging
both
the
allegations
and
the
amount
of
the
fine
beh
said
in
a
statement
beh
said
although
the
fine
should
be
paid
within
three
months
in
the
case
of
an
appeal
it
can
either
make
a
provisional
payment
of
the
fine
or
provide
collateral
the
bulgarian
government
says
the
european
commission
would
have
agreed
to
a
settlement
only
if
sofia
sold
a
majority
take
in
bulgatransgaz
to
a
european
strategic
investor
as
a
guarantee
that
market
would
not
be
distorted
bulgaria
which
still
meets
all
of
its
gas
needs
through
one
route
from
one
supplier
russia
s
gazprom
says
such
an
option
is
unacceptable
as
its
gas
pipelines
were
strategic
infrastructure
on
the
final
line
of
the
negotiations
we
proposed
all
kinds
of
options
that
should
guarantee
transparency
and
control
including
selling
a
minority
stake
deputy
prime
minister
tomislav
donchev
told
ministers
naturally
from
the
government
would
seek
an
agreement
for
a
majority
stake
sale
he
said
in
minutes
from
a
cabinet
meeting
published
by
the
government
s
press
office
sofia
plans
to
keep
bulgargaz
and
bulgartransgaz
as
beh
s
units
which
is
in
line
with
eu
energy
rules
the
country
is
working
to
diversify
its
gas
routes
and
suppliers
it
also
wants
to
build
a
new
pipeline
that
is
likely
to
transport
mainly
russian
gas
from
the
turkstream
pipeline
to
central
europe
bypassing
