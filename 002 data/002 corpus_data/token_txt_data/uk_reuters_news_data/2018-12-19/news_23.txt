the

surpassing
a

putting
unprecedented

on

it
is

we

told

the

lead
the

business
gomez
says
it
is
complicated
but
feasible
for
the
industry
to
install
the
megawatts
of
wind
power
which
along
with
mw
of
solar
capacity
must
be
in
place
by
early
to
meet
the
terms
of
government
auctions
held
in
and
building
the
auctioned
wind
capacity
will
cost
more
than
billion
euros
billion
according
to
the
spanish
wind
energy
association
but
some
in
the
sector
doubt
that
every
plant
can
be
brought
on
stream
in

underlining
the
scale
of
the
challenge
spain
faces
in
managing
its
shift

from

years

standstill

adding
new

they
will
be
close

they
can

build

spain
is
sprinting
to
meet
a
percent
european
union
target
for
energy
generated
from
renewable
sources
in
from
its
current
level
of
around
percent
the
wind
energy
association
says
this
target
which
if
missed
could
potentially
lead
to
eu
infringement
proceedings
and
potential
fines
is
within
reach
but
is
calling
for
a
stable
framework
to
reach
future
targets
prime
minister
pedro
sanchez
has
made
promoting
green
energy
a
cornerstone
policy
and
is
working
on
a
climate
change
law
which
foresees
installing
at
least
mw
each
year
to
we
need
regulation
that
helps
keep
investment
coming
to
the
market
in
spain
said
the
wind
energy
association
s
director
juan
virgilio
marquez
this
isn
t
about
sudden
spurts
and
jamming
on
the
brakes
but
advancing
bit
by
bit
every
year
towards
achieving
the
the
european
environment
agency
said
last
month
that
the
eu
s
progress
towards
increasing
the
use
of
renewable
energy
and
improving
energy
efficiency
was
slowing
putting
its
ability
to
meet
its
and
targets
at
risk
a
property
market
crash
precipitated
a
deep
recession
in
spain
and
put
paid
to
several
years
of
significant
additions
to
the
country
s
renewable
energy
capacity
as
cuts
to
state
subsidies
for
alternative
energy
froze
investment
and
prompted
lawsuits
against
spain
the
roughly
mw
of
capacity
that
appa
expects
to
be
installed
by
the
end
of
this
year
pales
in
comparison
with
next
year
s
planned
construction
but
is
nonetheless
the
biggest
increase
since
you
don
t
want
to
go
from
a
market
where
it
is
basically
famine
to
feast
so
quickly
said
wood
mackenzie
s
gaylord
while
the
domestic
market
sank
spanish
companies
that
had
specialized
in
wind
energy
technology
focused
on
exporting
but
now
the
tide
is
turning

logistics
manager
carlos
lopez
says
last
year
most
of
his
business
consisted
of
transporting
rotors
nacelles
housings
for
turbine
components
and
masts
for
export
but
now
he
has
around
projects
pending
in
spain
the
most
popular
location
for
new
wind
farms
is
the
northeastern
region
of
aragon
followed
by
the
northwestern
region
of
castile
and
leon
developers
are
trying
to
get
the
projects
done
as
soon
as
possible
but
wintry
weather
could
slow
construction
in
the
coming
months
lopez
warned
in
the
most
difficult
areas
it
might
not
be
possible
to
go
as
fast
as
people
want
we
often
have
to
stop
work
for
snow
or
erecting
turbines
whose
rotors
can
exceed
meters
ft
in
diameter
poses
a
particularly
big
logistical
challenge
but
solar
plant
developers
are
feeling
the
time
pressure
too
we
have
a
year
left
to
get
these
projects
working
which
we
are
perfectly
able
to
do
but
we
have
to
move
fast
