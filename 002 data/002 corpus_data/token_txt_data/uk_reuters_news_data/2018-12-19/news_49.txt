global
equity
and
crude
oil
markets
attempted
on
wednesday
to
claw
their
way
out
of
a
long
plunge
that
saw
investors
seek
out
the
safety
of
bonds
amid
mounting
pessimism
over
world
growth
oil
s
spectacular
fall
down
almost
percent
since
last
thursday
and
world
stocks
plunge
to
lows
have
prompted
speculation
the
federal
reserve
might
be
done
with
tightening
after
its
policy
meeting
later
in
the
day
there
was
also
some
support
from
china
which
announced

additional

small

market
focus
is
now
firmly
on
the
federal
reserve
which
is
widely
expected
to
deliver
a
rate
rise
but
could
signal
a
pause
next

expectations

pockets

likely
combine
to
produce

while
brent
crude
inched
up
percent
to
a
barrel
after
plunging
percent
overnight
its
percent
fall
since
october
is
sending
a
disinflationary
pulse
through
the
world
just
as
trade
and
economic
activity
are
cooling
the
latest
jolt
on
the
growth
front
came
from
japan
which
said
its
export
growth
slowed
to
a
crawl
in

however
the
global
benchmark
has
fallen
percent
since
the
start
of
this

given
the

signs
of

worldwide
wall

appears
set
for

futures
up
percent
but
stocks
are
set
for
their
worst
december
since
the
depths
of
the
great
depression
it
s
a
confluence
of
several
important
factors
the
market
is
adjusting
its
outlook
on
growth
and
there
is
a
consensus
we
will
see
a
slowdown
more
importantly
the
market
is
adjusting
to
the
idea
this
will
translate
into
lower
earnings
growth
said
norman
villamin
chief
investment
officer
for
private
banking
at
union
bancaire
privee
in
zurich
it
s
being
complicated
by
the
tightening
liquidity
situation
with
the
fed
expected
to
move
today
and
the
ecb
having
signalled
the
end
of
its
stimulus
expectations
of
a
fed
pause
and
the
equity
have
sent
treasury
yields
to
the
lowest
since
august
at
percent
down
basis
points
in
december
though
the
equity
recovery
lifted
yields
off
those
troughs
yields
in
japan
and
australia
also
reached
lows
reasons
for
the
bond
rally
were
easy
to
find
bank

merrill
lynch
s
closely
watched
monthly
survey
found
more
than
half
of
its
participants
now
flagging
a
global
economic
slowdown
next
year
it
also
showed
the
third
biggest
decline
in
inflation
expectations
on
record
the
poll
also
revealed
the
largest
ever
rotation
into
assets
their
gains
coming
at
the
expense
of
equities
the
steep
drop
in
treasury
yields
undermined
one
of
the
dollar
s
major
props
and
pulled
its
index
back
percent
to
from
a
recent
top
of
villamin
of
ubp
said
that
while
uncertainty
had
grown
about
the
fed
s
rate
rise
path
other
currencies
from
the
yen
to
the
euro
still
lacked
interest
rate
support
why
the
dollar
won
t
be
too
weak
is
that
the
alternatives
are
not
attractive
he
said
the
only
real
attractive
currency
out
there
is
the
dollar
we
think
dollar
strength
will
stay
another
futures

to
a
firmer
wall
street
opening
the
bright
spot
on
world
markets
is
italy
where
bond
yields
continued
their
fall
after
rome
struck
a
deal
with
the
eu
commission
over
its
contentious
budget
signalling
an
end
to
weeks
of
wrangling
the
bond
yield
gap
a
measure
of
italian
risk
narrowed
to
bps
the
tightest
since
late
september
that
spread
had
been
over
bps
as
recently
as
everyone
was
expecting
an
agreement
to
be
reached
but
many
people
were
expecting
this
to
come
in
or
next
year
said
commerzbank
rates
strategist
michael
leister
with
risk
sentiment
stabilising
this
morning
it
looks
like
the
momentum
can
increase
in
italian
