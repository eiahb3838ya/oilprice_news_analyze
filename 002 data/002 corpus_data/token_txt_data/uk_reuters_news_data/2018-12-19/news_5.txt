u.s. lawmakers seek oversight over any saudi nuclear power deal
washington
reuters
lawmakers
from
both
parties
introduced
legislation
on
wednesday
to
give
congress
more
say
in
any
deal
on
civil
nuclear
power
cooperation
between
the
united
states
and
saudi
arabia
the
trump
administration
is
eager
to
strike
a
deal
with
saudi
arabia
to
share
nuclear
power
technology
with
the
kingdom
as
the
domestic
industry
struggles
to
compete
with
power
sources
such
as
natural
gas
but
the
talks
have
come
under
scrutiny
since
the
killing
of
columnist
jamal
khashoggi
in
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
in
october
despite
president
donald
trump
s
desire
to
maintain
close
ties
to
saudi
arabia
several
of
his
fellow
republicans
have
joined
democrats
in
blaming
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
for
khashoggi
s
death
the
crown
prince
has
denied
knowledge
of
the
operation
that
killed
khashoggi
the
no
nuclear
weapons
for
saudi
arabia
act
would
require
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
to
approve
any
agreement
with
the
kingdom
typically
such
agreements
go
into
effect
unless
majorities
of
congress
pass
joint
resolutions
of
disapproval
it
is
unlikely
that
the
legislation
will
pass
before
the
end
of
the
current
congress
in
january
but
the
bill
raises
scrutiny
of
any
deal
it
also
calls
on
saudi
arabia
to
release
details
of
khashoggi
s
killing
before
a
deal
is
approved
concern
about
whether
saudi
arabia
could
use
nuclear
power
to
develop
a
weapons
program
mounted
after
the
crown
prince
told
cbs
in
an
interview
in
march
that
his
kingdom
would
develop
nuclear
weapons
if
its
archrival
iran
did
this
legislation
would
ensure
that
we
put
key
checks
in
place
to
ensure
that
saudi
arabia
never
ends
up
with
the
technology
or
materials
to
make
a
nuclear
bomb
and
that
congress
is
the
final
say
said
senator
edward
markey
a
democrat
markey
introduced
the
bill
with
senator
marco
rubio
a
republican
representatives
brad
sherman
a
democrat
and
luke
messer
a
republican
have
introduced
companion
legislation
in
the
house
the
talks
have
slowed
as
saudi
pushed
for
relaxing
nonproliferation
guidelines
known
as
the
gold
standard
that
could
allow
it
to
enrich
uranium
or
reprocess
fuel
waste
those
processes
raise
concerns
because
they
have
potential
to
create
quantities
of
uranium
and
plutonium
that
could
be
used
in
nuclear
bombs

perry
visited
saudi
arabia
this
month
to
talk
about
the
potential

has
said
he
told
the
kingdom
it
is
important
for
it
to
be
perceived
to
be
strong
on
nonproliferation
this
year
the
kingdom
put
the
united
states
on
a
short
list
of

the
