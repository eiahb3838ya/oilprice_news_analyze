china
s
maritime
authority
has
banned
the
discharge
of
wash
water
used
in
ships
to
strip
hazardous
sulphur
emissions
from
engine
exhaust
gases
from
for
some
ports
according
to
a
government
document
reviewed
by
reuters
on
tuesday
the
ban
on
water
discharge
from
scrubbers
is
part
of
an
effort
to
prepare
for
international
maritime
organization
imo
rules
that
will
ban
ships
from
using
fuel
oil
with
a
sulphur
content
of
more
than
percent
from
compared
with
percent
now
unless
they
are
equipped
with
exhaust
scrubbers
to
clean
up
sulphur
emissions
china
s
maritime
safety
administration
msa
said
in
a
policy
document
dated
on
that
it
would
ban
wash
water
discharge
at
some
river
and
coastal
ports
in
emission
control
areas
ecas
where
ships
are
already
limited
to
burning
only
fuel
with
a
sulphur
content
of
percent
the
ban
took
effect
on
the
first
day
of
msa
said
adding
that
ship
operators
are
also
not
allowed
to
discharge
any
residue
from
wash
water
or
burn
it
on
the
ships
china
said
last
september
it
would
impose
tighter
rules
from
on
emissions
from
vessels
in
and
around
the
ports
in
the
yangtze
river
delta
with
plans
to
later
extend
this
eca
to
include
the
country
s
entire
coastline
msa
said
in
the
document
dated
that
a
timeline
to
expand
the
ban
of
wash
water
discharge
to
more
coastal
ports
would
be
announced
at
an
appropriate
time
to
comply
with
the
ban
on
wash
water
discharge
in
the
designated
waters
shippers
will
have
to
switch
to
using
a
scrubber
system
or
switch
to
using
fuels
with
a
lower
sulphur
content
scrubbers
use
seawater
to
capture
sulphur
from
engine
exhausts
before
discharging
this
wash
water
back
into
the
ocean
after
treatment
in
systems
scrubbing
is
performed
using
water
treated
with
additives
recycling
the
liquid
internally
hybrid
scrubbers
are
a
combination
of
both
china
s
effective
ban
on
scrubbers

a
similar
move
by
singapore

in
late
november
said
it
would

refuelling

bunkering
some
chinese
port
cities
are
also
increasingly
targeting
the

bunkering
industry
taking
steps
to
show
that
they
will
be
ready
to
meet
