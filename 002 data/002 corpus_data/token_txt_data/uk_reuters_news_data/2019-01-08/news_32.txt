berlin
reuters
german
industrial
output
unexpectedly
fell
in
november
for
the
third
consecutive
month
adding
to
signs
that
companies
in
europe
s
largest
economy
are
shifting
into
a
lower
gear
due
to
mounting
risks
from
abroad
trade
disputes
driven
by
president
donald
trump
s
america
first
policies
the
threat
that
britain
will
leave
the
european
union
without
a
deal
in
march
and
weaker
growth
in
emerging
markets
are
putting
the
brakes
on
a
expansion
in
europe
s
economic
powerhouse
these
external
shocks
and
risks
are
cushioned
by
a
vibrant
domestic
economy
and
strong
household
spending
however
as
german
consumers
benefit
from
employment
pay
hikes
low
borrowing
costs
and
some
fiscal
stimulus
industrial
output
fell
by
percent
on
the
month
in
november
data
released
on
tuesday
by
the
federal
statistics
office
showed
coming
in
way
below
the
percent
increase
that
had
been
forecast
the
output
figure
for
october
was
revised
down
to
a
fall
of
percent
from
a
previously
reported
drop
of
percent
november
s
decline
in
german
industrial
production
adds
to
the
evidence
that
the
euro
zone
s
largest
economy
grew
at
a
meager
pace
in
jack
allen
of
capital
economics
said
german
factories
churned
out
fewer
intermediate
capital
and
consumer
goods
according
to
more
detailed
data
published
by
the
economy
ministry
output
in
the
construction
industry
also
decreased
as
did
production
in
the
energy
sector
the
economy
ministry
pointed
to
special
factors
including
an
unusually
high
number
of
bridge
days
around
national
holidays
and
problems
faced
by
the
car
industry
as
manufacturers
adjust
to
new
emissions
standards
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
told
broadcaster
ard
he
expected
the
upswing
to
continue
despite
increased
headwinds
from
abroad
as
the
domestic
economy
is
still
in
good
shape
and
order
books
are
full
there
are
risks
that
are
primarily
linked
to
foreign
business
and
the
international
arena
it
s
the
trade
conflicts
it
s
brexit
he
said
the
industrial
output
figures
followed
data
on
monday
that
showed
retail
sales
rose
more
than
expected
in
november
while
industrial
orders
fell
in
the
same
month
carsten
brzeski
of
ing
bank
said
the
unexpectedly
weak
production
data
had
increased
the
risk
of
a
technical
recession
after
a
percent
contraction
in
the
third
quarter
on
the
other
hand
private
and
public
consumption
still
have
the
potential
to
offset
recession
forces
brzeski
added
the
federal
statistics
office
will
publish
preliminary
gross
domestic
product
growth
data
for
the
fourth
quarter
and
as
a
whole
on
tuesday
next
week
altmaier
last
month
lowered
the
government
s
growth
forecast
for
to
around
to
percent
down
from
the
previous
estimate
of
percent
for
berlin
predicts
a
percent
expansion
the
government
hopes
tax
cuts
for
middle
and
high
income
earners
as
well
as
higher
child
allowances
that
come
into
effect
in
january
will
further
boost
consumption
which
has
replaced
exports
as
the
main
driver
of
growth
social
democrat
finance
minister
olaf
scholz
has
rejected
calls
from
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
conservatives
to
abolish
the
solidarity
tax
or
soli
for
all
taxpayers
including
the
top
percent

in
their
coalition
deal
parties
agreed
to
abolish
the
soli
income
tax
surcharge
for
