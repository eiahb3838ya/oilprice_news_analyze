some

last

secretary

predicted
on

that
beijing
and
washington
could
reach
a
trade

that
we
can
live

as
dozens
of
officials
from
the
world

two
largest
economies
resumed
talks
in
a
bid
to
end
their

china
s
foreign
ministry
said
beijing
had
the
good
faith
to
work
with
the
united
states
to
resolve
trade
frictions
but
many
analysts
doubt
the
two
sides
can
reach
a
comprehensive
agreement
on
all
of
the
divisive
issues
before
a
march
deadline
investors
also
continued
to
buy
battered
stocks
in
response
to
strong
job
data
on
friday
and
comments
by
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
that
he
was
aware
of
the
risks
and
would
be
patient
and
flexible
in
policy
decisions
this
year
powell
s
comments
have
eased
market
concerns
that
the
central
bank
might
ignore
signs
of
an
economic
slowdown
and
stick
to
its
script
of
two
rate
hikes
this
year
various
concerns
markets
had
earlier
are
receding
for
now
still
there
s
no
denying
that

momentum
is
slowing
said
hirokazu
kabeya
chief
global
strategist
at
daiwa
securities
ultimately
we
need
to
see
whether
upcoming

reports
can
dispel

p
companies
will
increase
their

per

by

from
a
year
earlier
down
from

growth
seen
three
months
ago
according
to
refinitiv
ibes
data
the
estimate
for

growth
has
fallen
to
about
percent
from

the
picture
is
murkier
for
tech
firms
whose
earning
growth
estimates
have
fallen
to

from

there
have
long
been
suspisions
that
tech
companies
might
be
overvalued
and
in
a
way
apple
gave
markets
confirmation
said
kazushige
kaida
head
of
forex
at
state
street
there
are
worries
more
tech
companies
may
issue
profit
warnings
which
means
there
will
remain

before

last

the

losing

as
investors
wind
back
expectations
of

a

conditions
in
most

much

the
