update 1-u.s. carbon emissions spike in 2018 on industry, fuel demand
washington
reuters
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
the
main
greenhouse
gas
spiked
last
year
after
falling
for
the
previous
three
as
cold
weather
spurred
natural
gas
demand
for
heating
and
as
the
economy
pushed
planes
and
trucks
to
guzzle
fuel
an
estimate
released
on
tuesday
showed
the
rhodium
group
an
independent
research
group
said
emissions
rose
percent
in
the
biggest
jump
since
when
the
economy
bounced
back
from
the
great
recession
rhodium
said
the
boost
from
the
world
s
carbon
emitter
after
china
could
make
it
harder
for
the
united
states
to
meet
reductions
targets
it
set
under
the
paris
agreement
in
to
do
so
the
united
states
would
have
to
cut
carbon
emissions
by
percent
on
average
over
the
next
seven
years
a
pace
more
than
twice
that
achieved
between
and
it
is
certainly
feasible
but
will
likely
require
a
fairly
significant
change
in
policy
in
the
very
near
future
favorable
market
and
technological
conditions
the
group
said
the
spike
occurred
even
though
brought
a
record
number
of
shutdowns
of
power
plants
fired
by
coal
the
fuel
richest
in
carbon
output
when
burned
natural
gas
which
emits
about
half
the
carbon
of
coal
replaced
most
of
the
lost
coal
generation
but
it
also
served
the
vast
majority
of
load
growth
for
electricity
last
year
the
report
said
the
trump
administration
which
has
announced
its
intent
to
leave
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
is
relaxing
rules
on
emissions
from
power
plants
and
vehicles
as
it
seeks
to
boost
production
of
oil
gas
and
coal
the
earliest
the
administration
can
leave
the
accord
is
after
the
presidential
election
the
environmental
protection
agency
did
not
respond
to
questions
about
the
rhodium
report
saying
it
would
only
answer
queries
related
to
the
partial
federal
government
shutdown
or
about
environmental
emergencies
trump
administration
officials
have
said
that
emissions
can
waiver
from
year
to
year
depending
on
the
economy
but
that
the
country
can
both
cut
emissions
and
enjoy
a
strong
economy
at
the
same
time
environmentalists
say
the
trump
administration
needs
to
speed
up
the
transition
from
natural
gas
to
renewables
such
as
wind
and
solar
power
and
energy
storage
coal
s
cousin
is
continuing
us
on
a
path
to
irreparable
and
costly
climate
damage
said
greg
cunningham
who
works
on
clean
energy
and
climate
at
the
conservation
law
foundation
it
is
imperative
that
we
shift
our
clean
energy
transition
into
high
gear
and
accelerate
our
clean
car
standards
to
reverse
this
the
american
petroleum
institute
the
top
lobbying
organization
for
the
oil
and
gas
industry
says
it
does
not
take
a
position
on
forming
a
carbon
tax
which
some
environmentalists
politicians
in
both
parties
and
petroleum
companies
say
would
harness
the
power
of
capitalism
to
reduce
emissions
the
api
backs
voluntary
efforts
to
reduce
emissions
mike
sommers
the
head
of
api
told
reporters
in
a
conference
call
that
the
united
states
can
boost
oil
and
gas
and
cut
emissions
at
the
same
time
