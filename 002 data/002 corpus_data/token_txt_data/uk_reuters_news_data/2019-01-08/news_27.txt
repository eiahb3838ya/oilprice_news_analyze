london
reuters
the
london
electric
vehicle
company
which
makes
the
city
s
famous
black
taxis
is
delaying
the
arrival
of
its
first
van
as
it
now
plans
to
work
more
closely
with
chinese
parent
company
geely
its
boss
said
levc
was
bought
out
of
bankruptcy
by
the
chinese
automaker
in
which
has
since
opened
a
pound
factory
in
central
england
and
turned
the
domestic
taxi
producer
into
an
exporter
the
firm
said
in
september
it
would
be
trialling
its
new
electric
van
this
year
but
chief
executive
chris
gubbey
told
reuters
on
tuesday
that
the
firm
s
first
commercial
vehicle
would
now
come
to
market
in
the
early
on
our
own
we
re
a
relatively
small
player
and
for
us
to
charge
ahead
and
develop
our
own
product
and
then
try
to
maintain
that
and
put
further
investment
in
to
build
off
that
does
not
make
sense
he
said
gubbey
said
the
decision
has
not
been
influenced
by
brexit
which
is
due
to
take
place
on
march
geely
said
on
monday
it
was
forecasting
flat
sales
a
sharp
slowdown
from
as
china
s
giant
auto
market
struggles
with
slowing
economic
growth
and
more
cautious
consumers
asked
whether
the
decision
regarding
levc
s
first
commercial
vehicle
was
linked
to
economising
at
geely
gubbey
said
that
word
hasn
t
come
up
in
the
levc
built
taxis
at
its
ansty
factory
last
year
and
expects
that
to
slightly
more
than
double
this
year
as
the
firm
sells
more
of
its
electric
models
in
both
its
home
market
and
to
countries
such
as
germany
and
france
however
like
manufacturers
across
the
country
the
firm
faces
the
challenge
of
a
possible
brexit
in
just
days
time
which
could
lead
to
tariffs
adding
to
costs
and
customs
checks
disrupting
the
flow
of
parts
and
vehicles
the
company
is
talking
to
its
logistics
provider
regarding
the
movement
of
components
which
are
predominately
delivered
via
trucks
through
the
port
of
dover
and
will
have
a
buffer
of
finished
vehicles
by
the
end
of
march
in
terms
of
the
export
sales
we
are
working
with
our
partners
in
terms
of
the
potential
for
taking
deliveries
early
so
that
they
ve
got
them
there
and
they
built
up
their
own
inventory
a
little
bit
earlier
