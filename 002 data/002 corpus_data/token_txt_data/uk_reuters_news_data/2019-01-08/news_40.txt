secretary
wilbur
ross
said
late
on
monday
that
beijing
and
washington
could
reach
a
trade
deal
that
we
can
live
with
as
dozens
of
officials
from
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
held
talks
in
a
bid
to
end
their
trade
dispute
that
has
roiled
global
markets
since
last
year
despite
optimism
around
the
talks
in
beijing
some
analysts
warned
that
the
relationship
between
washington
and
beijing
remained
on
shaky
grounds
and
that
tensions
could
flare

remain

said
in
its
outlook
the
political
establishment
believes
engagement
with
beijing
is
no
longer
working
and
it
s
embracing
an
openly
confrontational
approach
and
rising
nationalist
sentiment
makes
it
unlikely
that
beijing
will
ignore
provocations

looming
over
the

however
is
a
surge
in
oil
supply
driven
by
a
steep
rise
in

drilling
and
production
as
a

crude
oil
production
rose
by
a
whopping
million
barrels
per

last

to
a

with

to
rise
