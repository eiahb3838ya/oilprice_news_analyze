venezuela
s
congress
on
tuesday
issued
a
resolution
calling
deals
between
oil
company
pdvsa
and
and
french
companies
announced
this
week
illegal
since
they
had
not
been
sent
to
lawmakers
for
approval
the
body
said
the
oilfield
deals
with
france
s
maurel
prom
and
company
erepla
violated
article
of
venezuela
s
constitution
which
requires
that
contracts
signed
between
the
state
and
foreign
companies
be
approved
by
the
national
assembly
as
venezuela
s
congress
is
known
they
are
giving
concessions
that
violate
the
law
said
lawmaker
jorge
millan
mentioning
the
two
contracts
congress
largely
stripped
of
its
power
since
the
opposition
took
it
over
in
is
unlikely
to
be
able
block
the
deals
from
going
forward
but
the
rejection
could
create
legal
complications
under
a
future
government
maduro
is
set
to
be
inaugurated
for
his
second
consecutive
term
on
thursday
following
a
may
vote
considered
a
sham
by
the
domestic
opposition
and
many
foreign
governments
a
regional
bloc
of
latin
american
countries
last
week
called
on
maduro
a
protege
of
the
late
hugo
chavez
not
to
take
office
the
deals
are
part
of
maduro
s
effort
to
reverse
a
sharp
decline
in
the
opec
nation
s
crude
output
that
has
crippled
its
economy
erepla
said
it
would
invest
up
to
million
in
three
fields
while
maurel
prom
said
it
would
invest
up
to
million
for
a
percent
stake
in
an
oilfield
joint
venture
pdvsa
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
maurel
prom
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
outside
of
normal
business
hours
in
france
a
spokesman
for
erepla
registered
in
delaware
in
november
and
by
a
prominent
florida
republican
donor
and
shipping
magnate
said
venezuela
s
hydrocarbons
law
allows
pdvsa
to
contract
with
companies
like
erepla
to
execute
field
services
without
any
additional
approvals
referring
to
the
erepla
deal
during
the
congressional
session
earlier
on
tuesday
millan
said
that
while
pdvsa
referred
to
the
agreement
as
an
oilfield
service
contract
the
company
will
be
conducting
oil
exploration
and
production

act
in
