commodity
markets
appear
to
have
delivered
their
verdict
on
china
s
plans
to
stimulate
its
economy
betting
that
beijing
s
boost
to
infrastructure
spending
will
work
china
s
central
bank
cut
the
amount
of
cash
that
banks
have
to
hold
as
reserves
for
a
fifth
time
in
a
year
on
a
move
that
will
free
up
as
much
as
billion
in
new
credit
the
looser
monetary
policy
announcement
came
two
days
after
the
national
rail
operator
said
it
planned
km
miles
of
new
track
this
year
a
percent
lift
on
what
was
laid
last
year
this
implies
a
substantial
hike
on
the
billion
yuan
billion
invested
in
rail
in
cash
that
will
flow
through
to
increased
demand
for
steel
copper
and
also
for
coal
used
to
provide
energy
to
process
ores
into
refined
metals
certainly
the
prices
of
these
commodities
have
improved
in
recent
days
taking
heart
from
beijing
s
stimulus
and
also
from
some
renewed
optimism
that
progress
is
being
made
to
resolve
the
trade
dispute
shanghai
copper
futures
rose
percent
from
the
closing
low
of
yuan
a
tonne
on
to
end
at
yuan
on
monday
and
they
extended
gains
in
early
asian
trade
on
tuesday
london
copper
futures
also
rebounded
from
a
similar
low
of
a
tonne
on
closing
up
percent
at
a
tonne
on
monday
iron
ore
for
delivery
to
china
as
assessed
by
argus
media
has
been
rising
since
late
november
and
monday
s
close
of
a
tonne
was
up
percent
since
and
almost
percent
since
the
low
of
on
the
exception
so
far
is
thermal
coal
with
argus
media
s
assessment
of
cargoes
at
australia
s
newcastle
port
dropping
to
a
tonne
in
the
week
to
from
the
prior
week
however
newcastle
coal
is
still
almost
percent
higher
than
the
low
of
a
tonne
reached
on
thermal
coal
is
also
likely
to
have
struggled
in
recent
weeks
given
beijing
was
discouraging
imports
in
december
as
part
of
efforts
to
limit
total
imports
to
a
level
similar
to
those
in
while
this
failed
it
did
cause
seaborne
imports
of
coal
to
drop
to
million
tonnes
in
december
the
lowest
monthly
total
since
february
according
to
data
compiled
by
refinitiv
in
contrast
iron
ore
import
volumes
have
held
up
lending
some
fundamental
support
to
recent
gains
in
prices
china
s
seaborne
iron
ore
imports
were
million
tonnes
in
december
according
to
refinitiv
up
from
million
in
november
imports
on
unwrought
copper
were
tonnes
in
november
the
latest
month
for
which
official
data
is
available
up
from
the
prior
month
and
above
the
average
of
for
the
first
months
of
the
year
for
the
recent
price
gains
to
extend
into
a
sustained
rally
it
s
likely
that
physical
import
volumes
will
have
to
hold
up
or
grow
somewhat
in
coming
months
that
means
that
the
stimulus
measures
must
translate
to
actual
activity
sooner
rather
than
later
or
the
optimism
they
have
created
may
ebb
away
of
course
there
are
other
factors
that
will
drive
sentiment
and
commodity
prices
chiefly
the
success
or
otherwise
of
the
latest
round
of
talks
between
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
and
his
chinese
counterpart
xi
jinping
recent
positive
comments
from
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
notwithstanding
there
is
still
considerable
uncertainty
over
whether
an
agreement
can
be
reached
if
a
deal
is
struck
that
goes
some
way
to
normalising
trade
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
then
commodities
should
enjoy
a
relief
rally
that
will
add
to
the
positive
vibes
created
by
beijing
s
stimulus
the
risk
is
that
the
opposite
also
applies
a
no
deal
or
worse
an
escalation
in
the
dispute
would
likely
snuff
out
any
rally
in
commodities
such
as
iron
ore
coal
and
copper
