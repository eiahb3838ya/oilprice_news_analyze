a
solid
start
from
europe
kept
world
stocks
at
a
high
on
tuesday
after
asia
was
knocked
back
by
a
shock
profit
warning
from
tech
giant
samsung
and
a
in
borrowing
costs
hopes
that
washington
and
beijing
may
be
moving
towards
a
trade
deal
also
helped
the
mood
again
and
gave
the
dollar
a
lift
in
the
currency
markets
after
its
weak
start
to
the
year
that
rise
along
with
the
alarm
from
south
korea
s
samsung
that
it
would
badly
miss
its
earnings
forecasts
caused
a
swoon
in
emerging
markets
but
europe
held
its
nerve
unlike
last
week
after
a
similar
warning
from
apple
the
stoxx
rose
percent
britain
s
ftse
was
up
percent
amid
reports
of
a
brexit
delay
and
italian
banks
jumped
almost
percent
as
rome
stepped
in
to
support
another
of
its
troubled
lenders
i
think
the
market
has
been
quite
extreme
in
pricing
recession
risks
so
i
think
we
have
value
now
in
both
the
equity
and
bond
markets
seb
investment
management
s
global
head
of
asset
allocation
hans
peterson
said
the
discussions
between
the
and
china
will
take
some
time
but
i
think
the
markets
are
prepared
to
move
in
the
right
direction
on
positive
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
predicted
on
monday
that
beijing
and
washington
could
reach
a
trade
deal
that
we
can
live
with
as
dozens
of
officials
from
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
resumed
talks
in
a
bid
to
end
their
trade
dispute
on

the

p
had
gained
percent
following

surge

reversed
early
gains
however
to
end
down
percent
it
was
dragged
lower
by
falls

due
to
samsung

in
china
where

bond
yields
also
saw
their
biggest
daily
gain
in

china
s
foreign
ministry
said
beijing
had
the
good
faith
to
work
with
the
united

to
resolve
trade

but
many
analysts
doubt
the
two
sides
can
reach
a
comprehensive
agreement
on
all
of
the
issues
before
a
march
deadline
various
concerns
markets
had
earlier
are
receding
for
now

there
s
no
denying
that

earnings
momentum

slowing

ultimately
we
need
to
see
whether

can
dispel

its
