a
recent

beach
walk
washington
state
governor
jay
inslee
s
grandson
beamed
with
delight
as
he
spotted
a
crab
protecting
such
moments
of
connection
with
nature
are
one
of
the
motivations
driving
inslee
to
consider
running
for
the
presidency
with
action
on
climate
change
as
his
major
campaign
platform
that
type
of
experience
in
nature
is
what
is
so
threatened
and
i
want
my
grandkids
to
continue
to
have
those
experiences
inslee
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
a
telephone
interview
the
washington
democrat
from
one
of
the
country
s
states
would
likely
face
a
tough
uphill
climb
to
the
presidency
and
plenty
of
analysts
are
skeptical
of
his
chances
to
win
the
democratic
nomination
much
less
the
oval
office
but
inslee
believes
fighting
climate
change
should
be
the
top
priority
for
the
white
house
a
dramatic
shift
from
the
views
of
the
current
occupant
who
has
called
global
warming
a
hoax
and
plans
to
withdraw
the
from
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
it
requires
a
concerted
national
will
and
the
political
capital
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
put
their
shoulder
to
this
wheel
he
said
we
have
to
do
climate
a
host
of
democratic
challengers
to
republican
president
donald
trump
are
expected
to
join
the
political
fray
this
year
from
elizabeth
warren
of
massachusetts
to
former
vice
president
joe
biden
how
much
any
of
them
would
make
action
on
climate
change
a
priority
in
a
new
democratic
administration
remains
unclear
but
inslee
believes
there
is
an
economic
as
well
as
environmental
case
for
embarking
on
a
green
new
deal
that
would
transition
the
economy
off
fossil
fuels
and
toward
cleaner
renewable
power
he
likens
such
a
change
to
other
major
historical
shifts
from
the
united
states
build
up
of
world
war
two
industrial
might
to
the
research
and
development
program
behind
the
apollo
space
program
that
landed
americans
on
the
moon
we
have
to
change
our
economy
so
it
does
not
run
on
oil
and
diesel
and
instead
runs
on
clean
energy
inslee
said
that
is
the
largest
economic
transition
perhaps
in
human
history
since
we
went
from
pulling
a
travois
to
having
a
if
done
well
the
governor
said
decarbonizing
the
economy
could
spark
plenty
of
new
jobs
in
emerging
clean
energy
industries
a
view
he
outlined
in
his
book
apollo
s
fire
the
number
one
job
growth
rate
in
america
today
is
for
solar
installer
and
number
two
is
for
wind
maintenance
engineer
he
said
these
jobs
are
growing
twice
as
fast
as
the
rest
of
the
inslee
sees
his
state
which
he
has
governed
since
as
a
model
of
combined
legislation
and
strong
economic
growth
in
recent
years
washington
has
reviewed
its
energy
portfolio
to
boost
renewables
and
encouraged
cities
and
towns
to
buy
electric
buses
the
state
has
also
installed
a
network
of
electric
vehicle
charging
stations
and
seeded
a
clean
energy
research
and
development
fund
home
to
major
companies
such
as
microsoft
and
starbucks
washington
state
had
the
strongest
economy
in
the
united
states
last
year
according
to
an
analysis
of
indicators
by
personal
finance
website
wallethub
in
the
current
state
legislative
session
inslee
is
pushing
for
percent
clean
electricity
statewide
by
and
a
clean
fuel
standard
in
line
with
other
west
coast
states
but
efforts
to
put
in
place
carbon
pricing
in
the
state
have
failed
three
times
under
his
watch
inslee
has
not
yet
officially
announced
his
candidacy
for
president
but
in
october
he
started
a
political
action
committee
and
has
raised
through
november
for
a
potential
run
according
to
federal
election
filings
last
year
he
also
made
multiple
visits
to
early
primary
voting
states
as
chairperson
of
the
democratic
governors
association
he
believes
support
for
clean
energy
was
a
successful
campaign
issue
in
the
seven
governerships
that
democrats
won
from
republicans
in
the
midterm
elections
inslee
also
points
to
a
september
poll
of
likely
iowa
democratic
caucus
voters
who
said
restoring
leadership
on
climate
change
is
one
of
their
top
three
issues
but
a
yale
university
poll
from
last
march
suggested
global
warming
still
ranks
out
of
issues
of
importance
for
voters
nationally
political
scientists
say
that
is
likely
to
hinder
inslee
s
prospects
for
taking
his
green
campaign
national
the
brutal
reality
is
that
the
electorate
does
not
care
about
environmental
issues
said
aseem
prakash
director
of
the
university
of
washington
center
for
environmental
politics
prakash
gives
inslee
little
to
no
chance
of
winning
the
presidency
but
believes
a
bid
would
boost
his
national
visibility
and
make
him
a
viable
candidate
for
a
post
such
as
head
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
in
such
a
role
prakash
said
he
would
be
able
to
translate
a
lot
of
policies
he
has
been
talking
about
into
concrete
an
inslee
candidacy
on
a
climate
change
platform
also
could
encourage
other
democratic
candidates
to
talk
about
the
issue
the
former
congressman
remains
undeterred
about
his
likely
slim
chances
of
winning
the
top
job
pollsters
be
damned
he
said
you
ve
got
to
go
with
your
he
believes
combatting
climate
change
could
help
unify
a
fractured
country
and
that
he
could
be
the
one
to
push
ahead
the
action
needed
now
to
help
avoid
the
worst
impacts
of
climate
change
and
take
advantages
of
new
clean
energy
opportunities
unfortunately
we
re
at
the
eleventh
hour
in
terms
of
addressing
climate
change
inslee
said
but
it
can
be
our
hour
it
can
be
our
shining
hour
where
my
state
and
eventually
america
leads
the
world
in
a
clean
energy
