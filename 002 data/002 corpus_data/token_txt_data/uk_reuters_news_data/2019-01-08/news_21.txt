a
strong
day
for
europe
and
a
jump
in
wall
street
futures
kept
world
stocks
at
a
high
on
tuesday
after
asia
was
knocked
back
by
a
shock
profit
warning
from
tech
giant
samsung
hopes
that
washington
and
beijing
may
be
moving
towards
a
trade
deal
helped
the
mood
again
and
also
gave
the
dollar
a
lift
in
the
currency
markets
after
its
shaky
start
to
the
year
that
rise
along
with
the
alarm
from
south
korea
s
samsung
that
it
would
badly
miss
its
earnings
forecasts
caused
a
slip
in
emerging
markets
but
europe
held
its
nerve
unlike
last
week
after
a
similar
warning
from
apple
the
stoxx
rose
percent
despite
some
wobbles
in
italy
as
rome
stepped
in
to
support
another
of
its
struggling
lenders
britain
s
ftse
was
up
percent
too
as
its
retailers
cheered
rare
good
news
about
christmas
trading
i
think
the
market
has
been
quite
extreme
in
pricing
recession
risks
so
i
think
we
have
value
now
in
both
the
equity
and
bond
markets
seb
investment
management
s
global
head
of
asset
allocation
hans
peterson
said
the
discussions
between
the
and
china
will
take
some
time
but
i
think
the
markets
are
prepared
to
move
in
the
right
direction
on

president
donald
trump
tweeted
ahead
of
the
start
of
wall
street
trading
that
talks
with
china
which
were
going
into
a
second
day
were
going
very
well
commerce

had
predicted
on

that

and
washington
could
reach
a

futures
gained
percent
following
a
near
four
percent
surge
on
wall
street
since
friday
led
by
amazon
and
netflix
which
have
been
recovering
some
of
the
ground
they
lost
during
a
brutal
end
to
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
ended
down
percent
however
it
was
dragged
lower
by
falls
in
south
korea
due
to
samsung
and
in
china
where
government
bond
yields
also
saw
their
biggest
daily
gain
in
nine
months
china
s
foreign
ministry
said
beijing
had
good
faith
to
work
with
the
united
states
to
resolve
trade
friction
but
many
analysts
doubt
the
two
sides
can
reach
a
comprehensive
agreement
on
all
of
the
issues
before
a
march
deadline
various
concerns
markets
had
earlier
are
receding
for
now
still
there
s
no
denying
that
company
earnings
momentum
is
slowing
said
hirokazu
kabeya
chief
global
strategist
at
daiwa
securities
ultimately
we
need
to
see
whether
upcoming
earnings
reports
can
dispel
market
the
dollar
has
its
tail
up
trading
at
yen
and
to
the
euro
as
an
unexpected
fall
in
german
industrial
output
for
the
third
straight
month
also
helped
to
weaken
the
euro
zone
currency
the
british
pound
traded
a
tad
lower
at
as
british
and
european
officials
played
down
a
report
in
the
daily
telegraph
newspaper
on
plans
to
extend
britain
s
formal
article
notice
to
withdraw
from
the
european
union
i
wouldn
t
really
want
to
think
about
the
possibility
of
extending
article
here
and
now
said
i
don
t
think
this
is
what
we
ought
to
focus
on
today
german
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
told
journalists
during
a
visit
to
dublin
elsewhere
the
canadian
dollar
hit
highs
having
gained
percent
in
the
past
five
days
on
gains
in
oil
prices
and
on
speculation
the
bank
of
canada
will
raise
interest
rates
again
this
week
it
last
stood
at
per
dollar
in
the
government
bond
markets
europe
s
yields
were
squeezed
higher
by
a
deluge
of
upcoming
debt
sales
and
the
treasuries
yield
bounced
back
to
percent
from
friday
s
near
low
of
percent
still
its
latest
level
is
still
basis
points
below
its
october
peak
of
percent
and
recent
caution
from
the
head
of
the
federal
reserve
mean
futures
markets
are
now
pricing
in
a
slim
chance
of
a
rate
cut
this
year
oil
prices
were
also
up
again
on
tuesday
supported
by
hopes
for
trade
talks
in
beijing
and
a
wall
street
journal
report
that
saudi
arabia
is
planning
to
cut
crude
exports
to
around
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
by
the
end
of
january
both
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
futures
and
international
brent
crude
futures
stayed
firm
at
and
per
barrel
respectively
while
gold
eased
