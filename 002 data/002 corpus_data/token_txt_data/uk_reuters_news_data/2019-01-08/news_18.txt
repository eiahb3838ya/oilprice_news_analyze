mexican
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
said
on
tuesday
a
crackdown
had
dramatically
reduced
fuel
theft
and
uncovered
a
secret
pipe
that
was
used
to
siphon
gasoline
out
of
one
of
the
country
s
refineries
such
fuel
theft
has
dropped
from
truck
loads
per
day
to
since
thousands
of
soldiers
were
sent
to
company
pemex
s
installations
last
month
lopez
obrador
said
at
a
daily
news
conference
the
crackdown
on
years
of
mounting
fuel
theft
is
the
leftist
government
s
first
major
move
against
corruption
and
violence
after
taking
office
on
but
risks
angering
consumers
and
hurting
the
economy
by
closing
off
pipelines
and
refineries
while
it
traced
leakages
the
government
has
triggered
shortfalls
and
long
lines
at
gas
stations
in
at
least
six
states
including
guanajuato
a
major
hub
in
central
mexico
criminal
groups
and
others
who
have
tapped
pipelines
have
long
been
blamed
for
billions
of
dollars
of
losses
to
public
coffers
over
the
past
few
years
but
lopez
obrador
said
last
month
that
far
more
fuel
was
being
stolen
directly
from
pemex
installations
by
an
internal
network
of
corrupt
officials
lopez
obrador
said
the
military
had
discovered
a
mile
hose
that
was
funneling
fuel
out
of
storage
tanks
at
the
salamanca
refinery
in
the
central
state
of
guanajuato
into
a
secret
storage
area
he
admitted
there
were
complaints
about
the
shortages
but
said
they
were
not
widespread
and
urged
an
end
to
panic
buying
and
said
shortages
were
an
issue
of
distribution
not
supply
this
is
not
in
vain
lopez
obrador
said
we
are
going
to
end
local
media
showed
images
of
tanker
trucks
escorted
by
federal
police
heading
from
costal
states
to
the
country
s
interior
it
was
not
immediately
clear
what
impact
the
crackdown
will
have
on
imports
of
fuel
mexico
is
the
top
export
destination
for
energy
products
importing
about
million
barrels
every
day
or
nearly
a
quarter
of
all
overseas
sales
