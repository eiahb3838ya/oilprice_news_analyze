hedge
funds
are
cautious
on
the
outlook
for
oil
prices
despite
a
slump
at
the

fears
about

data

showed
funds
have
cut
their
net
long
position
in
brent
to
just
million
barrels
down
from
almost
million
at
the
end
of
september
and
close
to
the

since

bullish

outnumbered

there
are
some
signs
the
heavy
liquidation
of
bullish
positions
between
the
start
of
october
and
early
december
has
run
its
course
with
brent
prices
seeming
to
find
a
floor
above
per
barrel
but
most
fund
managers
have
preferred
to
wait
before
taking
new
long
positions
until
the
outlook
for
the

distillates

be
in
