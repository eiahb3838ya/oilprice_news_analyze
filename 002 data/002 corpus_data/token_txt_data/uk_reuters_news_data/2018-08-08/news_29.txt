china to slap additional tariffs on $16 bln worth of u.s. goods
reuters
china
is
slapping
additional
tariffs
of
percent
on
billion
billion
worth
of
imports
from
fuel
and
steel
products
to
autos
and
medical
equipment
the
chinese
commerce
ministry
said
as
the
world
s
largest
economies
escalated
their
trade
dispute
the
tariffs
will
be
activated
on
the
ministry
said
the
same
day
that
the
united
states
plans
to
begin
collecting
percent
extra
in
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
the
united
states
published
its
final
list
of
goods
subject
to
the
new
tariffs
on
tuesday
china
s
final
list
announced
on
wednesday
differs
from
an
earlier
draft
it
published
in
june
which
included
crude
oil
the
number
of
categories
of
goods
subject
to
tariffs
rose
to
from
in
the
june
draft
although
the
total
value
is
unchanged
the
action
that
prompted
the
chinese
retaliation
was
the
latest
by
president
donald
trump
to
put
pressure
on
china
to
negotiate
trade
concessions
after
washington
imposed
tariffs
on
billion
in
goods
last
month
china
has
vowed
to
retaliate
with
equivalent
tariffs
against
any
action
this
is
a
very
unreasonable
practise
the
chinese
commerce
ministry
said
of
the
action
on
wednesday
as
it
rolled
out
china
s
to
compensate
for
the
gap
on
its
tariff
list
caused
by
the
exclusion
of
crude
oil
china
added
fish
meal
wood
waste
paper
and
paper
waste
metal
scraps
and
various
types
of
bicycles
and
cars
among
other
products
last
week
china
proposed
additional
tariffs
on
another
billion
of
goods
after
trump
raised
planned
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
to
percent
from
percent
so
far
china
has
now
either
imposed
or
proposed
tariffs
on
billion
of
goods
representing
the
vast
majority
of
its
annual
imports
of
american
products
items
that
are
still
not
on
any
list
are
crude
oil
and
large
aircraft
a
spokeswoman
for
the
trade
representative
s
office
could
not
immediately
be
reached
for
comment
on
china
s
retaliation
announcement
or
whether
this
would
trigger
trump
s
next
round
of
threatened
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
ustr
is
conducting
a
public
comment
period
for
those
tariffs
which
could
reach
percent
due
to
end
it
would
take
a
few
more
weeks
to
revise
the
list
and
make
programming
changes
at
customs
and
border
protection
to
begin
collecting
the
duties
gary
hufbauer
a
senior
fellow
and
trade
expert
at
the
peterson
institute
for
international
economics
in
washington
said
he
expected
that
there
would
be
little
to
stop
further
escalation
of
the
tariff
war
as
both
sides
dig
into
entrenched
positions
my
expectation
is
that
tariffs
on
billion
of
imports
from
china
will
be
in
effect
about
a
month
prior
to
the
november
elections
that
s
soon
enough
to
be
used
by
trump
as
a
rallying
argument
but
late
enough
so
that
adverse
effects
will
not
occur
before
january
of
course
china
will
retaliate
probably
dollar
for
dollar
hufbauer
said
china
however
would
run
out
of
imports
to
levy
as
it
bought
only
billion
worth
of
american
goods
last
year
it
would
likely
have
to
impose
penalties
on
companies
doing
business
in
china
to
make
up
the
difference
