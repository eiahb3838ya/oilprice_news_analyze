on

supported
by
robust
earnings
and

of
additional

from

that
could

in

the

washington
is
preparing
to
start
collecting
tariffs
on

but
for
now
many
markets
especially

are

everyone
is
just
focusing
on
earnings
and
feeling
the

will
remain
robust
despite

uncertainties
and
that
s
the
main
driver
right
now
said
christophe

support
from

could
last

the
end
of
august
and
when

are
back
in

they
will
focus
more
on
other
events
the
trade
war
is
not
a
conflict
about

deficit
but
a
indeed
support
from

beijing
is
unveiling
further

to

such
as
increasing

said
beijing
s

was
starting

he
predicted
the

its

stem
from
