tesla
inc
s
production
of
solar
roof
tiles
has
been
delayed
by
problems
at
its
new
publicly
subsidized
factory
and
difficulties
producing
a
product
that
satisfies
the
aesthetic
demands
of
ceo
elon
musk
eight
former
and
current
employees
of
both
companies
told
reuters
repeated
since
the
buffalo
new
york
plant
opened
last
year
have
forced
tesla
s
partner
in
the
joint
venture
panasonic
to
seek
other
buyers
for
the
components
it
had
built
to
sell
to
tesla
according
to
a
panasonic
employee
a
former
panasonic
employee
and
a
former
tesla
employee
the
issues
have
also
rattled
the
faith
of
state
officials
in
tesla
s
ability
to
deliver
on
investment
and
employment
promises
it
made
in
exchange
for
million
in
state
subsidies
the
production
challenges
add
to
doubts
over
tesla
s
solar
operations
as
it
focuses
on
boosting
production
of
its
electric
vehicles
which
have
also
seen
repeated
production
delays
tesla
acquired
the
solar
business
in
in
a
controversial
billion
purchase
of
solarcity
a
sales
and
installation
company
founded
by
two
of
musk
s
cousins
but
the
business
has
been
shrinking
ever
since
for
a
graphic
showing
the
decline
in
tesla
solar
business
see
the
solar
roof
produced
at
the
new
york
factory
is
designed
to
look
like
a
normal
roof
while
generating
electricity
a
combination
that
has
proved
challenging
aesthetic
look
is
the
key
point
that
elon
is
always
not
satisfied
with
said
another
former
tesla
employee
who
works
in
fremont
california
that
s
the
big
in
a
call
with
tesla
investors
last
week
musk
said
hundreds
of
homes
already
had
solar
roofs
but
the
company
clarified
the
estimate
in
its
statement
to
reuters
saying
it
included
systems
that
had
been
partially
installed
or
were
being
scheduled
for
in
california
the
nation
s
leading
solar
market
there
were
twelve
tesla
roof
systems
connected
to
the
grid
as
of
may
all
in
northern
california
according
to
records
from
the
state
s
three
utilities
the
cost
per
watt
for
those
systems
was
listed
at
nearly
according
to
the
records
that
s
about
double
the
national
average
for
solar
systems
tesla
began
accepting
deposits
from
customers
for
the
solar
roofs
in
may
seven
months
after
it
unveiled
a
prototype
tesla
confirmed
in
a
statement
to
reuters
that
it
has
been
seeking
to
improve
on
its
production
process
for
the
solar
roof
at
the
new
york
plant
we
are
steadily
ramping
up
solar
roof
production
in
buffalo
and
are
also
continuing
to
iterate
on
the
product
design
and
production
process
the
company
said
in
the
statement
we
plan
to
ramp
production
more
toward
the
end
of
the
company
did
not
detail
its
current
production
and
did
not
comment
on
its
component
purchases
from
partner
panasonic
which
shares
space
in
the
factory
and
plans
to
produce
tesla
solar
panels
and
photovoltaic
cells
for
the
roofs
panasonic
has
been
selling
some
of
the
solar
panels
it
produces
in
buffalo
under
its
own
brand
instead
of
selling
them
to
tesla
panasonic
said
in
a
statement
it
has
also
been
shipping
a
large
volume
of
the
photovoltaic
cells
it
produces
in
buffalo
as
samples
to
prospective
buyers
because
of
low
demand
from
tesla
according
to
the
panasonic
employee
and
a
former
tesla
employee
panasonic
declined
to
comment
on
the
shipments
of
cell
samples
to
other
customers
but
said
in
a
statement
that
it
has
not
yet
completed
sales
to
buyers
other
than
tesla
or
signed
alternate
supply
deals
we
believe
tesla
will
use
panasonic
cells
when
it
the
solar
roof
the
company
said
in
a
statement
some
new
york
state
lawmakers
worry
tesla
may
fail
to
hold
up
its
end
of
the
bargain
the
state
provided
million
to
build
the
factory
along
with
million
for
equipment
and
million
for
additional
specified
scope
costs
according
to
a
tesla
filing
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
the
subsidy
package
requires
tesla
to
employ
people
in
buffalo
including
at
the
plant
within
two
years
of
the
facility
s
completion
and
to
spend
billion

over
a
decade
empire
state

the
state
s
economic
development
arm
is
overseeing
the
agreement
the
agency
believes
tesla
is
currently
meeting
its
obligations
said
spokeswoman
pamm

adding
that
the
company
would
face
penalties
of
million
a
year
if
it
falters
republican
new
york
state
assemblyman
ray
walter
who
represents
a
district
near
the
factory
said
it
concerned
him
that
only
a
small
portion
of
the
plant
appeared
functional
when
he
toured
it
in
march
after
investing
million
of
taxpayer
money
we
want
it
to
work
out
he
said
it
just
does
not
look
like
it
s
heading
down
that
tesla
said
in
its
statement
that
the
facility
now
employs
about
people
and
is
on
track
to
meet
all
of
its
commitments
none
of
the
tesla
sources
could
provide
a
production
figure
for
the
solar
roof
saying
only
that
output
was
low
and
frequently
interrupted
they
said
only
the
textured
black
version
of
the
solar
roof
had
been
produced
so
far
one
of
four
varieties
tesla
is
marketing
several
of
the
sources
at
the
plant
said
musk
had
never
visited
the
site
tesla
declined
to
comment
panasonic
recently
produced
about
conventional
solar
panels
per
day
at
the
plant
meant
to
be
sold
under
the
tesla
brand
and
about
photovoltaic
cells
per
day
that
were
intended
for
the
solar
roof
according
to
two
panasonic
sources
one
who
recently
left
the
company
that
would
put
annualized
production
at
about
a
quarter
of
tesla
s
target
for
the
plant
which
is
gigawatt
per
year
by
and
tesla
isn
t
buying
most
of
the
cells
being
produced
according
to
the
panasonic
employee
we
have
been
entertaining
outside
customers
the
employee
said
tesla
is
also
turning
to
other
suppliers
to
deal
with
the
aesthetic
concerns
using
cells
from
ja
solar
because
they
reflect
light
differently
said
a
current
tesla
employee
and
a
former
tesla
employee
the
current
employee
said
a
similar
panasonic
cell
was
now
undergoing
testing
and
would
be
used
in
future
versions
of
the
solar
roof
ja
solar
declined
to
comment
panasonic
started
cell
production
at
the
factory
in
february
but
recently
shut
down
manufacturing
to
install
new
equipment
on
its
production
lines
the
panasonic
employee
said
full
production
will
restart
in
september
the
employee
said
for
now
wooden
crates
filled
with
unused
equipment
are
sitting
around
the
factory
according
to
the
panasonic
employee
and
three
other
employees
with
knowledge
of
the
plant
operations
some
of
that
equipment
has
become
obsolete
over
the
past
couple
of
years
as
technology
has
changed
two
of
the
workers
said
one
of
the
few
customers
that
has
taken
delivery
of
the
solar
roof
is
tri
huynh
who
works
in
business
development
in
silicon
valley
huynh
said
he
paid
about
for
the
system
which
included
three
tesla
powerwall
home
batteries
to
store
the
power
produced
it
took
two
weeks
and
a
dozen
workers
to
install
compared
to
a
day
for
most
traditional
panel
systems
it
s
fantastic
i
love
it
he
said
adding
he
was
saving
hundreds
of
dollars
a
month
in
power
costs
i
m
a
tech
guy
so
i
kind
of
wanted
the
latest

jason
a
retired

entrepreneur
who
is
building
an

a

in
early
but
it
has
not
yet
arrived
and
he
has
been
unable
to
get
details
to
give
to
his
architect
and
engineers
