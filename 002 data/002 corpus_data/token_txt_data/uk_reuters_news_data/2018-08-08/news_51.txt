documents
filed
on
tuesday
suggest
expanding
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
will
cost
more
than
current
estimates
and
could
take
longer
than
expected
to
complete
in
a
report
filed
with
regulators
as
part
of
kinder
morgan
s
sale
of
the
trans
mountain
assets
to
the
canadian
government
the
company
s
financial

contemplated
possible
capital
cost
increases
of
c
billion
to
c
billion
to
billion
and
a
delay
of
up
to
one
year
to
december
kinder
morgan
has
not
provided
a
cost
update
since
march
despite
numerous
project
delays
to
the
c
billion
project
it
said
the
figures
produced
by
td
securities
should
not
be
taken
as
canada
agreed
in
may
to
buy
the
trans
mountain
assets
for
c
billion
to
save
the
controversial
expansion
which
will
nearly
triple
capacity
on
the
line
from
alberta
to
british
columbia
s
coast
the
deal
is
now
expected
to
close
late
in
the
third
quarter
or
early
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
according
to
a
proxy
filing
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
it
was
previously
expected
to
close
this
summer
canada
s
finance
ministry
did
not
immediately
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
work
on
the
trans
mountain
expansion
has
been
repeatedly
delayed
by
permitting
issues
and
political
opposition
kinder
morgan
halted
all
work
in
april
citing
project
risks
canada
will
fund
the
resumption
of
construction
work
on
the
expansion
under
a
covered
credit
facility
until
the
deal
closes
the
company
said
the
proxy
documents
included
a
report
prepared
by
td
securities
the
company
s
financial
adviser
which
analyzed
asset
value
based
on
three
possible
outcomes
for
the
trans
mountain
expansion
project
these
scenarios
included
a
final
pricetag
of
c
billion
with
delivery
of
december
a
c
billion
pricetag
and
a
delay
to
december
or
an
outright
cancellation
both
cost
estimate
scenarios
are
higher
than
the
current
estimate
the
trans
mountain
expansion
would
nearly
triple
the
capacity
of
the
existing
line
to
barrels
per
day
providing
much
needed
access
for
alberta
producers
to
offshore
markets

is

environmental
groups
and
