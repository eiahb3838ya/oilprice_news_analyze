was
an
act
of
cowardice
by
those
seeking
to
carry
out
an
illegal
impeachment
of
the
leadership
of
the
senate
in
flagrant
disregard
of
the
law
saraki
said
the
aim
was
to
bar
members
of
the
opposition
pdp
so
that
a
vote
of
lawmakers
could
be
convened
at
which
the
majority
needed
to
impeach
and
replace
him
could
be
secured

the
action
by

was
completely
unacceptable
and
was
taken
without

s
knowledge
he
fired
the
dss
chief
within
hours
of
the
blockade
but
in
an

the

appeared
to

back
from
osinbajo
s
criticism
it
accused
saraki
of
plotting
to
foment
violence
in
the
legislative
chamber
all
in
a
bid
to
stop
his
impeachment
we
are
now
aware
that
the
timely
intervention
of
