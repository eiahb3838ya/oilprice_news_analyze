robust
earnings
and
expectations
of
additional
stimulus
from
beijing
supported
world
shares
at
highs
on
wednesday
but
a
selloff
in
britain
s
pound
gathered
steam
over
mounting
concerns
for
the
country
s
outlook
equity
futures
suggested
a
modestly
weaker
open
on
wall
street
where
the
s
p
index
closed
tuesday
less
than
half
a
percent
off
record
highs
hit
in
january
that
testifies
to
the
strength
of
its
economy
and
corporate
sector
with
average
earnings
expanding
more
than
percent
in
the
second
quarter
the
picture
in
the
rest
of
the
world
is
less
rosy
given
slower
economic
momentum
and
the
greater
vulnerability
of
other
big
economies
from
china
to
germany
to
trade
levies
washington
is
preparing
to
start
collecting
tariffs
on
an
additional
billion
in
chinese
goods
while
markets
across
asia
were
broadly
supported
by
the
tech
rally
msci
s
index
of
stocks
from
countries
was
just
above
flat
everyone
is
just
focusing
on
earnings
and
feeling
the
market
will
remain
robust
despite
trade
uncertainties
and
that
s
the
main
driver
right
now
said
christophe
barraud
a
strategist
at
brokerage
market
securities
but
barraud
said
autumn
could
bring
a
reality
check
in
the
form
of
slower
growth
indicators
italian
politics
britain
s
brexit
talks
elections
and
above
all
the
risk
of
a
trade
war
escalation
support
from
earnings
could
last
until
the
end
of
august
and
when
people
are
back
in
september
they
will
focus
more
on
other
events
he
said
indeed
support
from
company
earnings
is
less
evident
elsewhere
european
shares
slipped
a
touch
and
while
average
european
second
quarter
earnings
growth
is
at
a
relatively
healthy
percent
according
to
thomson
reuters
the
rate
significantly
lags
wall
street
in
other
markets
chinese
equities
fell
percent
as
news
of
the
additional
tariffs
overshadowed
strong
trade
data
that
showed
exports
rose
more
than
expected
in
july
a
rise
in
imports
also
suggested
chinese
domestic
demand
remains
resilient
trade
fears
were
tempered
somewhat
by
signs
beijing
is
unveiling
further
measures
to
support
growth
that
s
lifted
the
yuan
off
recent
lows
to
the
dollar
though
the
currency
weakened
percent
on
the
day
however
the
biggest
currency
market
moves
of
the
day
came
on
the
british
pound
which
tumbled
to
lows
against
the
dollar
and
yen
and
a
low
against
the
euro
its
woes
stem
from
mounting
concerns
that
britain
could
crash
out
of
the
european
union
without
a
trade
deal
in
place
raising
fears
of
a
serious
hit
to
the
economy
that
prompted
the
bank
of
england
last
week
to
signal
an
extremely
cautious
trajectory
for
interest
rate
rises
in
the
coming
years
market
players
said
investors
were
moving
to
hedge
sterling
risks
a
lot
of
companies
can
t
wait
until
the
brexit
outcome
is
clear
many
of
them
are
trying
to
hedge
against
a
drop
in
sterling
barraud
of
market
securities
said
options
markets
indicated
the
currency
heading
for
further
weakness
over
months
beyond
the
march
date
when
the
country
is
scheduled
to
leave
the
eu
elsewhere
the
turkish
lira
the
biggest
mover
in
recent
days
fell
another
percent
to
the
dollar
on
fears
of
an
economic
crisis
triggered
by
galloping
inflation
and
worsening
ties
with
the
united
states
the
lira
stayed
off
recent
record
lows
however
on
oil
markets
brent
futures
held
firm
around
a
barrel
as
sanctions
on
iranian
goods
went
into

intensifying
