more
pakistan

green
cover
is
going
down
our
cities
have
become
concrete
jungles
and
there
is
increasing
air
pollution
our
mode
of
development
is
wrong
aslam
said
at
the
pti
s
launch
of
its
first
days
agenda
held
a
month
before
the
july
ballot
khan
told

that
global

is
a
reality
we

for
our

lauded
his
provincial

project
which
he
said
had
met
its
targets
percent
from
planting
trees
and
the

from
assisting
the
natural
regeneration
of
existing
forests
pakistani
climate
expert
adil
najam
who
is
dean
of
boston
university
s
pardee
school
of
global
studies
said
the
pti
had
made
the
environment
especially
planting
trees
its
issue
and
it
has
demonstrated
that
you
can
get
political
mileage
from
environmental
issues
he
said
describing
that
as
a
major
step
forward
this
also
comes
at
a
time
when
the
public
awareness
of
these
issues
especially
water
and
climate
concerns
are
on
the
rise
so
there
is
certainly
the
potential
of
he
said
the
key
test
would
be
keeping
the
political
focus
on
the
policy
and
ensuring
action
experts
say
pakistan
is
facing
enormous
environmental
challenges
a
survey
conducted
by
the
sdpi
ahead
of
the
poll
found
that
respondents
prioritized
three
key
environmental
issues
rising
temperatures
water
shortages
and
air
pollution
aslam
said
pti
s
experience
in
delivering
on
the
green
agenda
for
khyber
pukhtunkwa
province
had
put
it
in
good
stead
to
do
so
nationally
we
set
out
targets
in
clean
energy
forests
clean
water
and
we
met
them
he
said
adding
that
the
province
s
project
had
been
the
largest
in
the
country
s
history
and
had
met
its
targets
using
just
half
the
allocated
budget
the
pti
s
days
agenda
document
also
stated
it
would
establish
a
task
force
to
draft
green
legislation
and
devise
more
projects
kashmala
kakakhel
a
climate
finance
expert
who
helped
with
the
days
agenda
document
said
thinking
on
climate
change
needed
to
evolve
from
piecemeal
interventions
to
a
guiding
principle
for
pakistan
s
development
agenda
we
need
to
recognise
it
as
an
economic
opportunity
with
an
immense
potential
for
job
creation
she
said
this
government
plans
to
review
or
develop
new
targets
for
our
renewable
energy
mix
for
increasing
our
forest
cover
for
developing
along
a
climate
resilient
she
pointed
out
that
once
targets
were
set
nationally
specific
interventions
could
be
designed
this
will
also
aid
in
identifying
which
interventions
we
can
fund
ourselves
and
for
which
ones
we
will
need
to
tap
into
international
climate
finance
funding
aslam
also
said
the
new
government
wanted
to
green
the
economic
corridor
cpec
a
infrastructure
project
he
said
that
while
visiting
china
in
his
capacity
as
the
of
the
international
union
for
conservation
of
nature
iucn
a
he
had
been
amazed
at
the
astronomical
changes
underway
as
china
cleans
up
its
environment
we
would
like
to
strive
for
a
green
charter
for
cpec
he
said
despite
the
pti
s
green
focus
pakistan
remains
committed
under
cpec
to
developing
its
lignite
coal
reserves
in
the
thar
desert
with
two
coal
power
plants
already
functional
according
to
cpec
s
website
coal
is
an
issue
aslam
admitted
adding
that
pakistan
could
look
to
counter
pollution
by
introducing
environmental
controls
the
head
of
the
sdpi
s
study
centre
shakeel
ramay
said
coal
s
share
of
the
country
s
energy
mix
is
less
than
percent
for
the
time
being
coal
is
an
option
and
pakistan
should
benefit
from
it
as
others
have
he
said
however
in
the
long
run
pakistan
must
look
for
renewable
sources
of
energy
