is
open
and
transparent
reasonable
fair
and
lawful
not
violating
any
united

council
resolutions
it
added
china

have
invested
billions
of

respect
the

have
promised
to
try
to
lessen
the
blow
of
sanctions
and
to
urge
their
firms
not

pull
out

that
has
proven
difficult
and
european
companies
have
quit
iran
arguing
that
they
can
not
risk
their
business
few
american
companies
do
much
business
in
iran
so
the
impact
of
sanctions
mainly
stems
from
washington

ability
to
block
european

asian
firms
from
trading
there
among
large
european
companies
that
have
suspended
plans
to
