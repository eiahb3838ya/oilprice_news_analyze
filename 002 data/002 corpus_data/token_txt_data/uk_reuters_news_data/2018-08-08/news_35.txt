a
year
turkmenistan
is
building
the
tapi
pipeline
to
diversify
its
gas
exports
which
have
mostly
gone
to
china
but
the
project
has
suffered
lengthy
delays
due
to
difficulties
obtaining
financing
and
the
security
risks
of
building
a
pipeline
through
afghanistan
mobin
saulat
the
chief
executive
officer
of
pakistan
s
inter
state
gas
systems
isgs
told
reuters
that
chinese
officials
have
shown
growing
interest
in
building
a
spur
from
pakistan
and
the
line
could
act
as
an
alternative
to
beijing
s
plans
to
build
a
fourth
pipeline
with
this
channel
there
is
a
possibility
they
don
t
have
to
do
another
line
and
they
can
from
this
pipeline
which
is
passing
through
pakistan
saulat
said
a
line
has
to
cross
several
central
asian
mountain
ranges
and
saulat
said
it
would
be
cheaper
and
easier
for
china
to
built
a
line
from
inside
pakistan
s
territory
to
cross
the
karakoram
range
to
its
western
border
china
s
ties
to
islamabad
have
deepened
in
recent
years
as
beijing
has
pledged
to
fund
billion
in
infrastructure
as
part
of
its
belt
and
road
initiative
including
power
stations
and
transport
links
facing
more
delays
tapi
countries
have
changed
tack
to
attract
financing
and
make
progress
in
the
past
two
years
the
project
is
now
due
to
be
done
in
two
phases
with
the
pipeline
built
without
compressors
in
the
first
phase
which
would
cut
gas
volume
but
would
reduce
prohibitive
project
costs
once
gas
starts
flowing
and
the
pipeline
begins
generating
cash
flow
financing
would
be
raised
for
the
second
phase
that
would
see
compressors
installed
along
the
km
mile
pipeline
project
with
this
introduction
of
the
phased
approach
it
has
gained
momentum
with
the
chinese
said
saulat
the
financial
close
for
the
first
phase
is
due
by
the
end
of
september
saulat

bank
promising
billion
