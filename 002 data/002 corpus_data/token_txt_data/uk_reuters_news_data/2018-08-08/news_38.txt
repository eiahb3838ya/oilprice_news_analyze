london
reuters
centrica
will
raise
its
standard
energy
prices
for
british
gas
customers
for
the
second
time
this
year
it
said
on
wednesday
blaming
rising
wholesale
costs
around
million
customers
on
its
dual
fuel
standard
variable
tariff
will
be
hit
with
a
percent
price
increase
from
the
rise
comes
as
energy
regulator
ofgem
prepares
to
implement
a
price
cap
on
standard
tariffs
by
the
end
of
the
year
to
combat
what
the
government
has
called
rip
off
energy
prices
the
rise
also
comes
on
top
of
a
percent
increase
in
british
gas
standard
prices
on
may
centrica
said
it
needed
to
implement
the
latest
increase
to
a
near
percent
rise
in
wholesale
costs
since
april
until
now
we
have
been
able
to
shield
customer
bills
from
the
full
impact
of
the
increase
in
the
wholesale
costs
because
of
the
way
we
buy
energy
in
advance
mark
hodges
ceo
of
centrica
consumer
said
in
a
statement
ofgem
on
tuesday
said
the
cap
on
its
safeguard
tariff
for
the
most
vulnerable
customers
would
also
increase
in
october
due
to
higher
wholesale
costs
analysts
have
warned
ofgem
s
price
caps
will
do
little
to
stop
energy
bill
increases
household
energy
prices
are
set
to
continue
to
rise
despite
ofgem
s
safeguard
tariff
or
the
government
s
default
price
cap
which
is
set
to
replace
it
later
this
year
gareth
miller
chief
executive
of
consultancy
cornwall
insight
said
on
its
website
only
if
wholesale
costs
fall
sharply
will
the
pressure
abate
