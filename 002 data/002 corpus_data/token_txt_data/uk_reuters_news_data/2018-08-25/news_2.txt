abiy
s
eprdf
remains
in
power
protests
that

to
the
resignation

and
farming
has
struggled

exacerbated

massive
investment

infrastructure
over
the
last
decade
the
government
last
month
called
on
ethiopians
to
bring
their
hard
currency
into
banks
to
ease
the
shortage
a
move
which
closed
the
once
yawning
gap
between
the
official
and
black
market
exchange
rates
for
the
birr
currency
on
saturday
abiy
said
economic
sabotage
had
taken
place
and
adding
that
large
groups
were
still
hoarding
foreign
exchange

giving
details
though
the
government
has
pledged
to
partially
privatise
several
key
companies
including
the
telecoms
monopoly

the
speed
with
which
it
will
