said
on
saturday
that
the
united
states
could
reach
a
big
trade
agreement
with
mexico
soon
as
the
incoming
mexican
trade
negotiator
signalled
possible
solutions
to
nafta
energy
rules
and
a
contentious
sunset
clause
demand
trump
tweeted
on
saturday
morning
that
the
united
states
relationship
with
mexico
is
getting
closer
by
the
hour
some
really
good
people
within
both
the
new
and
old
government
and
all
working
closely
together
big
trade
agreement
with
mexico
could
be
happening
soon
jesus
seade
who
will
serve
as
chief
negotiator
for
mexico
s
next
government
said
he
and
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
were
now
discussing
a
periodic
review
process
that
spare
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
from
automatic
expiration
unless
new
terms
were
agreed
mexico
and
canada
have
adamantly
opposed
the
sunset
demand
that
would
kill
the
pact
unless
it
is
renegotiated
every
five
years
a
plan
that
business
groups
also
say
will
stifle
investment
decisions
it
s
going
to
come
out
it
s
no
longer
what
the
united
states
was
putting
first
in
any
way
seade
said
of
the
sunset
clause
outside
the
trade
representative
s
office
seade
said
he
and
lighthizer
last
week
began
discussing
a
new
approach
to
review
the
trade
pact
that
would
have
longer
periods
between
reviews
providing
more
certainty
for
business
investments
a
spokeswoman
for
the
trade
representative
s
office
denied
that
lighthizer
had
softened
his
position
on
the
sunset
clause
without
further
elaboration
the
sunset
issue
is
one
of
the
biggest
remaining
obstacles
to
a
nafta
deal
as
negotiators
race
to
try
to
land
a
new
nafta
agreement
in
principle
by
the
end
of
august
the
united
states
and
mexico
have
been
holding
bilateral
talks
aimed
at
resolving
their
differences
before
bringing
canada
back
to
the
talks
seade
said
the
issue
of
auto
sector
rules
is
basically
resolved
although
some
aspects
including
time
frames
are
still
being
discussed
seade
also
said
on
saturday
that
a
correct
focus
on
nafta
s
energy
chapter
has
already
been
substantially
agreed
since
mexico
s
july
presidential
election
the
talks
have
been
complicated
by
divisions
between
the
incoming
and
outgoing
mexican
administrations
over
energy
policy
the
team
of
leftist
mexican
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
has
resisted
enshrining
the
opening
of
the
oil
and
gas
sector
enacted
by
outgoing
president
enrique
pena
nieto
in
the
new
nafta
people
close
to
the
talks
say
lopez
obrador
opposed
pena
nieto
s
energy
reform
and
the
issue
is
divisive
within
his
own
camp
aides
back
greater
outside
investment
in
the
industry
while
his
more
nationalist
allies
want
the
oil
to
remain
in
mexican
hands
asked
about
trump
s
tweet
mexican
economy
minister
ildefonso
guajardo
acknowledged
some
progress
but
told
reporters
in
washington
before
beginning
another
day
of
talks
that
the
two
countries
are
not
there
nothing
is
done
until
everything
is
truly
done
he
said
today
will
be
an
important
trump
prompted
the
nafta
revamp
more
than
a
year
ago
complaining
the
pact
has
benefited
mexico
to
the
detriment
of
workers
and
manufacturing
he
made
renegotiating
nafta
one
of
his
top
campaign
pledges
trump
has
threatened
to
withdraw
from
the
pact
if
it
is
not
reworked
to
the
advantage
of
the
united
states
the
talks
for
weeks
focused
on
crafting
new
rules
for
the
automotive
industry
which
trump
has
put
at
the
centre
of
his
drive
to
rework
the
deal
he
says
has
been
a
disaster
for
american
workers
