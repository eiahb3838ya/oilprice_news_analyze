the
dollar
jumped
to
a
top
on
tuesday
while
asian
shares
started
cautiously
as
investors
were
hopeful
of
a
positive
outcome
from
a
highly
anticipated
summit
which
could
set
the
stage
for
ending
a
nuclear
on
the
korean
peninsula

that

a
touch
softer
at
the
historic
meeting
between
president
donald
trump
and
north
korea
s
kim
jong
un
is
due
to
start
at
gmt
in
singapore
ahead
of
the
summit
trump
said
the
meeting
could
work
out
very
nicely
as
the
countries
try
to
narrow
differences
on
how
to
end
a
nuclear
standoff
on
the
korean
peninsula
many
analysts
said
the
bar
was
pretty
low
for
what
will
be
deemed
a
successful
summit
given
the
past
failures
in
talks
with
north
korea
this
seems
to
be
the
first
step
on
the
road
in
what
is
going
to
be
a
long
drawn
out
process
said
ray
attrill
head
of
forex
strategy
national
australia
bank
sydney
if
there
appears
to
be
a
genuine
intent
on
both
sides
to
use
this
summit
as
a
platform
for
a
serious
negotiation
of
a
peace
treaty
i
guess
that
s
what
success
would
look
like
today
he
said
nobody
is
expecting
a
peace
treaty
today
that
is
being
overly
optimistic
but
if
this
turns
out
to
be
a
complete
failure
there
might
be
some
implications
for
risk
a
denuclearisation
deal
would
be
positive
for
south
korean
assets
given
the
possible
boost
to
growth
and
fading
geopolitical
risks
analysts
at
goldman
sachs
said
in
a
note
the
lead
from
wall
street
was
mixed
too
with
the
dow
barely
changed
the
s
p
up
percent
and
the
nasdaq
adding
percent
there
were
some
nerves
after
trump
upset
the
group
of
seven
s
efforts
to
show
a
united
front
choosing
to
back
out
of
a
previous
joint
communique
the
action
drew
criticism
from
germany
and
france
and
trump
called
canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
very
dishonest
and
by
and
large
though
markets
are
generally
shrugging
off
the
trainwreck
attrill
said
instead
they
are
looking
ahead
to
a
busy
week
tuesday
s
north
korea
summit
will
be
followed
by
policy
meetings
of
the
federal
reserve
which
is
expected
to
raise
rates
and
the
european
central
bank
as
well
as
a
brexit
bill
vote
in
the
british
parliament
the
greenback
was
well
bid
on
tuesday
morning
with
the
dollar
index
up
percent
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
against
the
safe
haven
yen
the
dollar
jumped
to
a
top
of
also
helping
calm
markets
were
comments
from
italy
s
new
coalition
government
that
it
had
no
intention
of
leaving
the
euro
zone
and
planned
to
cut
debt
the
euro
hovered
near
a
high
of
it
was
last

commodities
crude
rose
cents
to

while
brent
gained

to

gold

weaker
