the

hovered
near
highs
on
tuesday
and
asian
shares
gained
as
president
donald
trump
and
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
signed
a
comprehensive
deal
at
a
historic
summit
aimed
at
the
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
trump
said
the
process
of
denuclearisation
would
happen
very
very
quickly
adding
he
had
formed
a
special
bond
with
kim
and
the
relationship
with
north
korea
would
be
very
different
the
letter
that
we
re
signing
is
very
comprehensive
and
i
think
both
sides
are
going
to
be
very
impressed
with
the
result
trump
said
after
a
really
very
positive
summit
meeting
in
singapore
a
lot
of
goodwill
went
into
this

kim
had
earlier
said
the
meeting
was
a
good
prelude
to
peace
just
months
after
the
two
leaders
traded
insults
and
tensions
spiralled
in
the
region
over
the
reclusive
regime
s
nuclear
programmes
yet
there
was
some
unease
among
investors
about
the
outcome
of
the
talks
given
the
tense
relations
between
the
two
nations
the
combatants
of
the
korean
war
are
technically
still
at
war
as
the
conflict
in
which
millions
of
people
died
was

the

analysts
at
singapore
s
dbs
said
in
a
note
the
landmark
summit
meeting
should
help
to
remove
a
major
tail
risk
for
the
region
s
markets
and
economies
they
added
however
it
would
be
prudent
to
contain
excessive
optimism
given
the
enormous
gulf
between
the
two
koreas
and
the
costs
of
many
analysts
were
uncertain
about
the
overall
impact
on
global
economies
and
markets
from
the
peace
talks
with
some
pointing
to
a
growing
risk
of
an
international
trade
war
as
a
much
bigger
headwind
to
world
growth
just
this
past
weekend
trump
upset
the
group
of
seven
s
efforts
to
show
a
united
front
choosing
to
back
out
of
a
previous
joint
communique
the
action
drew
criticism
from
germany
and
france
and
trump
called
canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
very
dishonest
and
however
markets
are
generally
shrugging
off
the
trainwreck

instead
they
are
looking
ahead
to
a
busy

north

summit
will
be
followed
by
policy
meetings
of
the
federal
reserve
and
the
european
central
bank
as
well
as
a
brexit
bill
vote
in
the
british
parliament
the

was
well

against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
the

is
virtually
guaranteed
to
raise
