said
on
tuesday
that
percent
of
its
petrol
stations
in
france
had
run
out
of
fuel
on
the
second
day
of
a
blockade
of
refineries
and
fuel
depots
by
farmers
that
has
disrupted
distribution
farmers
are
protesting
against
france
s
decision
to
allow
total
to
use
imported
palm
oil
at
a
biofuel
plant
which
would
compete
with
biodiesel
made
from
locally
produced
oilseed
crops
further
souring
relations
between
the
eu
s
biggest
farm
sector
and
the
government
of
president
emmanuel
macron
the
blockade
now
concerned
a
total
of
refineries
and
depots
across
france
and
would
continue
until
the
farm
minister
agreed
to
some
of
the
farmers
demands
said
the
fnsea
the
country
s
largest
farm
union
which
is
organising
the
protests
it
is
really
an
alarm
call
that
farmers
on
blocked
sites
have
sent
out
to
say
please
listen
to
us
and
take
up
this
message
at
a
european
level
fnsea
president
christiane
lambert
said
after
meeting
agriculture
minister
stephane
travert
the
negotiation
is
not
over
we
do
not
have
what
we
want
but
by
mutual
agreement
we
decided
to
meet
again
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
move
forward
on
our
claims
she
added
total
which
operates
petrol
stations
and
five
of
france
s
seven
refineries
and
nine
depots
said
the
depots
and
four
refineries
were
still
blocked
the
refineries
were
still
operating
there
are
some
difficulties
in
supplying
petrol
stations
particularly
in
paris
and
the
region
a
total
spokesman
said
total
had
urged
customers
not
to
rush
to
petrol
stations
to
fill
their
tanks
which
could
spark
panic
buying
and
shortages
french
authorities
last
month
gave
total
permission
to
use
palm
oil
as
a
feedstock
at
its
la
mede
biofuel
refinery
in
southern
france
infuriating
farmers
who
grow
crops
such
as
rapeseed
environmentalists
also
blame
palm
oil
cultivation
for
deforestation
in
southeast
asia
total
argues
its
plans
call
for
using
less
palm
oil
than
allowed
by
the
authorities
offer
an
outlet
for
tonnes
of
locally
produced
rapeseed
and
will
develop
recycling
of
used
oil
and
fat
but
lambert
said
tonnes
was
not
enough
and
that
the
price
needed
to
be
based
on
producers
costs
not
on
palm
oil
prices
as
long
as
we
are
not
successful
we
will
remain
on
the
blockades
