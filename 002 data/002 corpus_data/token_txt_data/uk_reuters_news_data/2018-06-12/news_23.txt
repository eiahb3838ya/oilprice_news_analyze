skb
s
application
for
the
nuclear
waste
repository
needed
to
replace
an
interim
storage
facility
it
is
currently
using
was
dealt
a
blow
earlier

we
have
just
received
the
request
by
the
ministry
to
continue
with
the
application
and
submit
the
additional
documents
by
january
we
are
doing
the
research
needed
and
will
produce
what
is
needed
by
then
he
said
the
court
s
objections
to
skb
s
application
otherwise
supported
by
sweden
s
radiation
safety
authority
were
due
to
concerns
over
the
ability
of
the
designed
capsules
to
contain
the
nuclear
waste
in
the
long
term
after
we
hand
the
documentation
the
ministry
should
decide
on
the
application
by
the
first
half
of
said
hoff
the
permanent
repository
designed
to
store
up
to
tonnes
of
spent
fuel
from
sweden
s
nuclear
plants
could
take
years
to
complete
and
the
country
s
nuclear
plant
operators
have
raised
concerns
about
the
delays
in
authorising
it
it
is
important
that
we
get
a
solution
in
place
for
the
permanent
storage
of
nuclear
waste
as
soon
as
possible
expediting
this
matter
must
be
prioritised
to
prevent
the
process
from
becoming
