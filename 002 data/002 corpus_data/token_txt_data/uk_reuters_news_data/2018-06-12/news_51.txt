the
dollar
jumped
to
a
top
on
tuesday
and
asian
shares
rose
as
president
donald
trump
said
a
summit
meeting
with
north
korea
s
kim
jong
un
had
made
a
lot
of
progress
boosting
hopes
of
a
landmark
deal
to
end
a
nuclear
standoff
on
the
korean
peninsula
asked
by
reporters
how
the
historic
talks
were
going
trump
said
a
lot
of
progress
really
very
positive
i
think
better
than
anybody
could
have
expected
top

the
line
very
good
we

going
now

he
gave
no
further
details
kim
had
earlier
said
the
meeting
was
a
good
prelude
to
peace
just
months
after
the
two
leaders
traded
insults
and
tensions
spiralled
in
the
region
over
the
reclusive
regime
s
nuclear
programmes
yet
there
was
some
unease
among
investors
about
the
outcome
of
the
talks
given
the
tense
relations
between
the
two
nations
the
combatants
of
the
korean
war
are
technically
still
at
war
as
the
conflict
in
which
millions
of
people
died
was
concluded
only
with
a
truce
the
dollar
rose
against
the
yen
while
the
korean
won
gained

with
japan
s
nikkei
paring
early

to

earlier
rising

much

msci
s

south
korean
shares
reversed
losses
to
inched
percent
higher
while
chinese
shares
were
buoyant
after
starting
in
the
red
with
the
jumping
percent
the
key
question
is
whether
this
summit
will
lead
to
a
lasting
materially
positive
outcome
analysts
at
ocbc
said
in
a
note
from
an
international
relations
perspective
this
appears
unlikely
what
is
perhaps
more
likely
is
a
positive
opening
act
in
a
long
drawn
drama
they
said
expect
a
positive
risk
environment
to
persist
if
the
summit
can
conclude
without
many
analysts
said
the
bar
was
pretty
low
for
what
will
be
deemed
a
successful
summit
given
the
past
failures
in
talks
with
north
korea
so
today
we
have
the
opportunity
for
a
historic
meeting
a
possible
end
to
the
korean
war
and
a
possible
move
to
denuclearise
and
maybe
even
demilitarize
the
korean
peninsula
said
robert
carnell
chief
economist
at
ing
all
of
that
s
great
but
how
can
you
make
money
from
it
well
the
short
answer
is
you
probably
shouldn
t
even
carnell
said
that
a
far
bigger
existential
global
threat
was
the
ongoing
tariff
dispute
after
trump
upset
the
group
of
seven
s
efforts
to
show
a
united
front
choosing
to
back
out
of
a
previous
joint
communique
the
action
drew
criticism
from
germany
and
france
and
trump
called
canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
very
dishonest
and
however
markets
are
generally
shrugging
off
the
trainwreck
said
ray
attrill
head
of
forex
strategy
at
national
australia
bank
instead
they
are
looking
ahead
to
a
busy
week
tuesday
s
north
korea
summit
will
be
followed
by
policy
meetings
of
the
federal
reserve
and
the
european
central
bank
as
well
as
a
brexit
bill
vote
in
the
british
parliament
the
dollar
was
well
bid
on
tuesday
with
the
dollar
index
up
percent
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
the
federal
reserve
is
virtually
guaranteed
to
raise
interest
rates
this
week
while
investors
are
focused
on
the
monetary
policy
outlook
on
the
safe
haven
yen
the
dollar
jumped
to
a
top
of
in
early
deals
it
was
last
at
helping
calm
markets
were
comments
from
italy
s
new
coalition
government
that
it
had
no
intention
of
leaving
the
euro
zone
and
planned
to
cut
debt
the
euro
stepped
back
from
a
high
