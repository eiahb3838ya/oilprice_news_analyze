london

opec
said
the
oil
market
outlook
in
the
second
half
of
is
highly
uncertain
even
though
the
producer
group
s
figures
show
a
global
glut
has
ended
suggesting
talks
next
week
on
relaxing
a
supply
cut
deal
won
t
be
straightforward
opec
russia
and
other
producers
have
been
cutting
output
since
january
to
get
rid
of
excess
supply
and
boost
prices
the
deal
s
goal
was
originally
to
reduce
inventories
in
developed
nations
to
that
of
the
average
in
a
report
on
tuesday
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
said
those
inventories
in
april
fell
to
million
barrels
below
the
average
that
s
down
from
million
barrels
above
the
average
in
january
with
oil
hitting
a
barrel
this
year
the
highest
since
saudi
arabia
and
russia
are
discussing
raising
output
but
iran
disagrees
and
iraq
has
voiced
restraint
pointing
to
a
tough
policy
meeting
on
june
in
vienna
opec
in
the
report
was
cautious
on
the
outlook
for
the
rest
of
citing
a
rise
in
oil
production
and
the
chances
of
global
demand
weakening
recent
developments
in
the
oil
market
have
led
to
pronounced
uncertainty
about
the
second
half
of
the
year
opec
said
in
the
report
while
oil
demand
in
the
china
and
india
shows
some
upside
potential
downside
risks
might
limit
this
potential
going
oil
pared
an
earlier
decline
after
the
report
was
released
trading
just
above
a
barrel
while
the
main
goal
of
the
supply
deal
was
to
reduce
oil
stocks
to
the
average
ministers
have
said
other
metrics
should
be
considered
also
suggesting
they
are
in
no
hurry
to
end
supply
cuts
the
report
said
opec
members
were
still
cutting
much
more
than
needed
even
though
output
in
may
rose
slightly
and
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
is
boosting
supply
opec
output
climbed
by
barrels
per
day
to
million
bpd
opec
said
according
to
figures
it
collects
from
secondary
sources
that
is
almost
bpd
less
than
the
amount
opec
says
the
world
needs
from
the
group
this
year
figures
reported
directly
by
opec
members
showed
some
bigger
rises
in
production
saudi
arabia
told
opec
its
output
rose
to
million
bpd
up
bpd
from
april
although
this
is
still
below
riyadh
s
opec
target
venezuela
whose
plunging
output
due
to
an
economic
crisis
has
helped
boost
opec
compliance
with
the
deal
told
opec
production
rose
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
april
s
figure
was
the
lowest
in
decades
strong
demand
due
to
a
robust
economy
has
helped
remove
the
glut
opec
left
its
global
demand
growth
estimate
this
year
unchanged
at
million
bpd
and
said
oil
use
would
surpass
million
bpd
for
the
first
time
during
the
fourth
quarter
but
the
higher
prices
that
have
followed
the
deal
have
prompted
growth
in
rival
supply
and
a
flood
of
shale
opec
expects
supply
to
expand
by
million
bpd
this
year
about
bpd
more
than
expected
last
month
opec
said
there
is
a
wide
forecast
range
of
million
bpd
in
estimates
of
the
amount
of
crude
the
group
needs
to
pump
in
the
second
half
meaning
demand
could
be
significantly
more
or
less
than
members
current
output
this
outlook
for
the
second
half
of
warrants
close
monitoring
of
the
factors
impacting
both
world
oil
demand
and
supply
that
will
shape
the
outlook
of
the
oil
market
going
forward
