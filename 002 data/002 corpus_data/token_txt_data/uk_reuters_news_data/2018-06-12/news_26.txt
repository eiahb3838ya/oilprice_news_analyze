about
the

s
planned
asset
swap
deal
with
gazprom
in
order
to
address
oslo
s
concerns
the

executive
said
in
omv
agreed
to
swap
percent
of
its
norway
assets
for
percent
of
the
russian
company
s
urengoy
gas
field
but
norway
s
energy
minister
terje
soeviknes
said
in
may
this
year
he
was
concerned
the
deal
would
give
gazprom
access
to
the
norwegian
continental
shelf
we
now
have
to
hold
discussions
and
talk
to
the
minister
chief
executive
rainer
seele
told
reuters
on
tuesday
talks
would
take
place
in
at
the
earliest
he
said
in
an
interview
i
do
not
even
want
to
think
about
setting
up
a
date
during
the
world
cup
the
german
added
omv
and
gazprom
remained
committed
to
the
deal
he
said
when
asked
whether
an
outright
purchase
of
gazprom
s
assets
as
suggested
by
sources
was
also
an
option
should
any
obstacles
arise
in
the
talks
with
the
ministry
then
we
must
discuss
with
gazprom
how
to
deal
with
it
he
said
russia
is
a
core
region
for
omv
as
production
is
cheap
and
transport
pipelines
to
austria
are
in
place
omv
bought
about
a
quarter
of
the
yuzhno
russkoye
field
one
of
russia
s
largest
gas
fields
last
year
and
is
one
of
gazprom
s
construction
partners
in
the
nord
stream
pipeline
nord
stream
which
will
double
russia
s
capacity
to
pipe
gas
to
europe
has
been
criticised
by
some
in
the
european
union
who
say
it
will
make
the
bloc
too
reliant
on
russian
gas
and
strengthen
gazprom
s
already
dominant
position
seele
said
the
pipeline
would
protect
european
energy
security
against
possible
transatlantic
interventions
he
also
said
russia
could
be
relied
on
to
keep
gas
flowing
as
it
needed
the
revenue
from
european
importers
as
long
as
russia
needs
this
market
we
can
manage
that
wonderfully
he
said
with
more
than
percent
of
necessary
approvals
on
the
route
already
granted
seele
said
he
hoped
denmark
would
give
approval
for
the
pipeline
to
be
built
near
its
coast
in
the
summer
regarding
omv
s
work
in
iran
seele
said
the
austrian
group
planned
to
conclude
seismic
studies
but
would
not
pursue
projects
further
after
the
united
states
withdrew
from
a
nuclear
pact
with
tehran
and
said
it
would
reimpose
sanctions
let
s
face
it
you
can
not
simply
carry
on
in
iran
he
said
sanctions
are
a
much
bigger
risk
for
omv
s
business
than
any
possible
compensation
that
europe
could
the
european
union
signatories
to
the
nuclear
pact
with
iran
have
said
they
want
to
keep
the
deal
in
place
omv
started
operations
in
iran
in
as
operator
of
the
mehr
exploration
block
in
the
west
of
the
country
it
halted
work
in
due
to
sanctions
but
signed
several
agreements
for
new
projects
when
the
deal
was
reached
