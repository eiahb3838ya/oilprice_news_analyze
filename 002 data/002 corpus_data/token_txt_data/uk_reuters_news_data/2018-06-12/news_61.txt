said

has
been
supported
by
healthy
demand
and
voluntary
production
cuts
led
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
but
analysts
said
oil
markets
were
also
currently
heavily
driven
by
public
policy
events
and
statements
trump
and
kim
will
hold
a
summit
on
tuesday
in
singapore
where
both
sides
seek
to
narrow
differences
over
how
to
end
a
nuclear
standoff
on
the
korean
peninsula
the
meeting
is
officially
due
to
start
at
singapore
time
gmt
a
positive
resolution
from
singapore
is
bullish
for
stocks
said
greg
mckenna
chief
market
strategist
at
futures
brokerage
axitrader
and
several
oil
traders
said
crude
futures
could
also
get
a
lift
from
such
an
outcome
in
oil
market
fundamentals
however
not
all
things
point
to
higher
prices
with
output
from
the
three
biggest
producers
russia
the
united
states
and
saudi
arabia
on
the
rise
russian
production
has
reportedly
risen
from
below
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
million
bpd
in
early
june
in
the
united
states
production
has
risen
by
almost
a
third
in
the
last
two
years
to
a
record
of
million
bpd
now
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
which
has
so
far
led
opec
s
efforts
to
withhold
supplies
is
also
showing
signs
of
upping
production
saudi
arabia
has
told
opec
that
it
raised
oil
output
to
a
little
more
than
million
bpd
in
may
up
from
million
bpd
in
april
this
fits
with
the
theory
that
the
saudis
and
russians
are
subtly
moving
toward
a
change
to
the
agreement
at
this
month
s
meeting
mckenna
said
opec
together
with
some
producers
including
russia
started
withholding
output
in
to
end
a
global
supply
overhang
and
prop
up
prices
opec
and
its
partners
are
due
to
meet
on
june
at
the
cartel
s
headquarters
in
vienna
austria
to
discuss
policy
oil
prices
are
likely
to
trade
in
a
tight
range
ahead
of
next
