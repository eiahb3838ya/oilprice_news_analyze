investors
in
colombia
s
oil
and
mining
sectors
have
much
at
stake
in
sunday
s
presidential
race
with
the
frontrunner
pledging
measures
to
revive
production
while
his
leftist
rival
wants
to
end
reliance
on
petroleum
and
coal
the
country
s
top
exports
leftist
candidate
gustavo
petro
a
former
member
of
the
guerilla
group
has
promised
to
overhaul
oil
firm
ecopetrol
sa
the
south
american
nation
s
biggest
company
to
refocus
it
on
renewable
energy
ecopetrol
is
responsible
for
about
percent
of
colombia
s
flagging
oil
production
of
around
barrels
per
day
and
operates
export
pipeline
infrastructure
at
current
rates
of
production
colombia
has
just
six
years
worth
of
oil
the
energy
ministry
says
and
urgent
investment
in
exploration
is
needed
to
replace
reserves
making
sunday
s
vote
decisive
for
its
future
as
an
oil
exporter
petro
has
also
stirred
alarm
with
promises
to
let
coal
mining
contracts
lapse
in
colombia
the
world
s
coal
exporter
target
a
shift
towards
agricultural
production
however
the
favourite
to
win
sunday
s
poll
ivan
duque
has
diametrically
opposed
positions
pledging
to
cut
taxes
and
boost
colombia
s
competitiveness
in
extractive
industries
we
can
t
have
a
policy
of
destroying
productive
sectors
duque
told
reuters
we
are
not
yet
an
oil
country
we
are
a
country
with
potential
we
must
continue
exploration
of
conventional
and
offshore
oil
so
that
we
maintain
the
foreign
currency
flows
that
oil
exports
bring
ecopetrol
declined
comment
but
it
has
said
any
transition
to
renewable
energy
should
be
orderly
companies
are
already
grappling
with
security
concerns
as
well
as
local
referendums
and
environmental
court
rulings
that
have
stymied
major
mining
projects
in
latin
america
s
economy
we
like

chief
executive
ari
sussman
said
during
a
visit
to
the
company
s
buritica
project
which
will
begin
full
production
in
i
do
not
think
petro
would
be
good
for
colombia
because
i
think
everything
would
freeze
sussman
said
referring
to
the
legislative
bottlenecks
that
the
leftist
s
lack
of
support
in
congress
could
cause
anglogold
ashanti
ltd
suspended
a
potentially
billion
billion
pounds
project
last
year
after
the
surrounding
community
voted
to
ban
mining
a
recent
paper
by
the
colombian
petroleum
association
acp
which
represents
private
crude
producers
warned
that
planned
referendums
put
of
oil
production
at
risk
petro
however
has
voiced
strong
support
for
such
local
community
referendums
and
also
wants
to
ban
mining
which
accounts
for
almost
all
colombia
s
coal
and
gold
production
although
petro
lies
some
points
behind
duque
in
opinion
polls
his
economic
proposals
are
stirring
alarm
among
some
investors
there
is
unified
concern
over
what
petro
has
proposed
economically
said
analyst
sergio
guzman
of
control
risks
the
chances
that
it
happens
are
slim
but
the
fear
doesn
t
stop
being
most
companies
and
trade
associations
declined
to
comment
for
this
story
graphic
on
latin
american
elections
duque
s
solution
to
dwindling
oil
reserves
is
to
encourage
investment
in
exploration
which
he
says
could
provide
years
more
oil
production
though
his
campaign
has
declined
to
give
precise
figures
the
acp
says
the
industry
needs
to
spend
up
to
billion
a
year
just
to
keep
output
between
and
bpd
private
oil
companies
plan
to
invest
up
to
billion
this
year
acp
said
while
ecopetrol
plans
to
spend
up
to
billion
duque
has
promised
tax
cuts
for
the
sector
combined
with
investment
at
ecopetrol
s
refineries
meant
to
allow
exports
of
more
derivatives
duque
will
bolster
foreign
investor
sentiment
into
extractive
industries
analysts
molly
shutt
and
mara
roberts
duque
of
bmi
research
said
the
former
senator
has
also
pledged
to
improve
transport
for
crude
as
part
of
a

in
industrial
improvements
and
bolster

to
the

offline
since

the

high

petro
has
said
he
will
replace
lost
commodities
income
over
a
decade
with
agricultural
production
which
he
says
will
provide
more
jobs
his
platform
mentions
food
production
but
he
has
not
provided
further
details
his
campaign
did
not
respond
to
questions
despite
petro
s
pledge
to
aid
poor
farmers
with
land
reform
the
agricultural
federation
which
includes
coffee

rare
presidential

tax
cuts
and
credits
petro
s
pledge
to
buy
unproductive
land
to
give
away
to
poor
farmers
has
sparked
concern
opponents
said
the
rhetoric
reeked
of
the
expropriation
practiced
by
socialist
leaders
in
neighbouring
venezuela

is
in
deep
economic
