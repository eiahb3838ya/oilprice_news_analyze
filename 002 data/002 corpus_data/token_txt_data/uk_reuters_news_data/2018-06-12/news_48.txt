are

fuel
oil
margins
have
demonstrated
additional

jbc
energy
said
in
a
research
note
last
week
lower
fuel
oil
output
in
venezuela
due
to
refinery
outages
and
a
lack
of
crude
oil
and
refinery
upgrades
in
russia
the
middle
east
india
and
south
korea
have
all
contributed
to
tightening
global
supplies
of
the
fuel
used
to
generate
electricity
and
power
industrial
boilers
and
ships
with
the
fuel
oil
surplus
in
the
middle
east
shrinking
this
year
and
next
due
to
increased
power
plant
expansions
the
region
is
projected
to
become
a
net
fuel
oil
importer
by
though
only
for
a
short
period
of
time
nasseri
said
increasing
saudi
arabian
power
demand
amid
falling
supply
from
there
the
united
arab
emirates
and
kuwait
underpin
the
big
shift
he
said
the
fuel
oil
discount
to
dubai
crude
on
monday
settled
at
a
barrel
with
dubai
crude
holding
above
a
barrel
in
november
when
dubai
crude
was
last
at
similar
levels
the
same
fuel
oil
crack
or
margin
was
at
a
discount
wider
than
a
barrel
reflecting
fuel
oil
s
strength
the
singapore
crack
was
the
only
one
to
post
gains
over
the
past
few
weeks
with
ample
supplies
and
rising
crude
prices
weighing
on
other
refined
fuels
including
gasoline
and
diesel
fuel
oil
cracks
should
weaken
as
we
move
through
as
seasonal
demand
support
wanes
and
destocking
pressures
from
a
highly
backwardated
market
compensate
for
growing
tightness
in
the
fundamental
balance
jbc
said
while
strength
in
fuel
oil
markets
subsides
with
the
passing
of
peak
utility
demand
though
some
analysts
and
traders
see
limited
downside
for
fuel
oil
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
in
addition
to
tightening
supplies
looming
sanctions
on
oil
exports
from
iran
a
major
fuel
oil
producer
with
exports
of
about
million
tonnes
in
could
further
limit
fuel
oil
outflows
mainly
to
asia
also
expectations
of
higher
crude
supplies
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
amid
rising
output
from
producers
outside
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
including
the
united
states
and
russia
could
weigh
on
crude
prices
potentially
lending
support
to
fuel
