new
solar
installations
in
will
stay
at
the
same
level
as
last
year
due
to
weakness
in
several
major
residential
markets
and
a
slowdown
in
big
projects
after
a
rush
to
beat
a
tax
credit
deadline
according
to
a
report
released
on
tuesday
the
forecast
came
despite
a
percent
rise
in
the
first
quarter
to
gigawatts
accounting
for
percent
of
total
generating
capacity
added
gtm
research
said
in
the
report
commissioned
by
the
solar
energy
industries
association
new
solar
installations
which
surged
for
much
of
the
last
decade
fell
almost
percent
in
to
gigawatts
because
developers
in
completed
a
slew
of
projects
ahead
of
a
scheduled
expiration
of
a
key
tax
credit
that
ultimately
was
extended
the
report
said
government
policies
that
supported
renewable
energy
and
a
sharp
fall
in
the
price
of
the
technology
propelled
expansion
gtm
raised
its
forecast
for
installations
by
percent
to
gigawatts
noting
that
many
developers
had
secured
panels
before
import
tariffs
were
imposed
by
the
trump
administration
this
year
the
tariffs
will
be
felt
mostly
next
year
and
beyond
gtm
said
reducing
its
forecast
by
megawatts
this
sector
will
grow
about
percent
in
but
will
be
flat
in
and
due
to
project
delays
it
added
module
prices
averaged
cents
per
watt
during
the
first
quarter
percent
above
the
cents
average
a
year
ago
due
to
the
tariffs
the
research
firm
ratcheted
down
its
residential
market
outlook
by
percent
from
gw
to
gw
mature
markets
including
massachusetts
new
york
and
new
jersey
are
expected
to
decline
this
year
gtm
said
residential
solar
installations
fell
percent
last
year
but
was
flat
during
the
first
quarter
a
promising
sign
of
a
market
recovery
after
a
pullback
by
national
installers
like
tesla
inc
it
added
residential
system
prices
have
stagnated
as
the
cost
of
acquiring
customers
has
risen
steadily
over
the
last
four
quarters
