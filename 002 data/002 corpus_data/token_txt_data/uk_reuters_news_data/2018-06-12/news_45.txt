opec will squeeze oil buffer to historic lows with an output hike
london
reuters
the
oil
industry
will
face
the
biggest
squeeze
on
its
spare
production
capacity
in
more
than
three
decades
if
opec
and
its
allies
agree
next
week
to
hike
crude
output
leaving
the
world
more
at
risk
of
a
price
spike
from
any
supply
disruption
spare
capacity
is
the
extra
production
oil
producing
states
can
bring
onstream
and
sustain
at
short
notice
providing
global
markets
with
a
cushion
in
the
event
of
natural
disaster
conflict
or
any
other
cause
of
an
unplanned
supply
outage
that
buffer
could
shrink
from
more
than
percent
of
global
demand
now
to
about
percent
its
lowest
since
at
least
if
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
russia
and
other
producers
decide
to
increase
output
when
they
meet
on
june

you
would
essentially
be
taking
million
barrels

bpd
of
spare
capacity
down
to
approximately
million
bpd

said
adding
global
demand
was
million
bpd
some
analysts
say
spare
capacity
could
even
fall
below
percent
after
years
of
low
oil
prices

down

has
indicated
its
support

at
next

meeting
in
vienna
has
said
it
is
alert
to
the
potential
squeeze
on
the
market
we
are
concerned
about
tight
spare
capacity
nowadays
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
told
reuters
last
month
although
he
also
said
the
industry
was
in
better
shape
than
in
when
oil
prices
plunged
below
a
barrel
opec
and
its
allies
have
been
curbing
supply
since
january
to
boost
oil
prices
and
cut
bloated
global
inventories
the
price
of
crude
has
since
surged
climbing
above
a
barrel
last
month
while
inventories
have
also
fallen

stocks
but
falling
inventories
which
have
now
dropped
back
to
around
their
average
in
industrialised
nations
adds
to
the
conundrum
facing
opec
today
we
no
longer
have
an
inventory
cushion
or
a
large
spare
capacity
claudio
descalzi
chief
executive
of
italy

said
in
january
in
this
context
any
geopolitical
event
can
create
a
price
oil
prices
have
faced
one
jolt
already
this
year
a
decision
to
pull
out
from
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
and
reimpose
sanctions
helped
prices
climb
to
their
highest
since

oil

the
high
level
of
inventory
over
the
past
few
years
has
meant
that
the
market
did
not
need
to
react
to
rising
political
risk
because
the
inventory
was
effectively
the
same
thing
as
spare

told

last

that

morgan
stanley
s
global
oil
strategist
said
oil
prices
would
be
supported
if
supply
and
demand
is
in
balance
if
inventories
have
drawn
significantly
and
spare
capacity
isn
t
all
that
the
precise
level
of
spare
capacity
available
depends
in
part
on
how
it
is
defined
the
international
energy
agency
iea
which
bases
its
figures
on
oil
production
that
can
be
brought
onstream
within
days
and
sustained
for
an
extended
period
estimates
opec
s
spare
production
capacity
was
million
bpd
in
april
with
saudi
arabia
accounting
for
roughly
percent
the
energy
information
administration
eia
which
defines
it
as
production
that
can
be
brought
online
for
days
and
sustained
for
at
least
days
put
opec
s
spare
capacity
at
million
bpd
in
the
first
quarter
based
on
the
eia
definition
robert
mcnally
at
consultancy
rapidan
energy
group
said
saudi
arabia
russia
kuwait
and
united
arab
emirates
together
had
spare
capacity
of
about
million
bpd
so
were
they
to
raise
by
million
bpd
then
million
bpd
is
left
scraping
the
low
end
of
the
range
historically
and
uncomfortably
tight
given
the
high
and
rising
geopolitical
disruption
risk

days
to

and
raise
production
to
million
or
million
bpd
the
kingdom
s
output
in
may
was
about
million
bpd
but
saudi
arabia
could
even
boost
production
beyond
its
stated
output
capacity
of
about
million
bpd
possibly
adding
another
million
bpd
of
what
is
known
as

capacity
the
kingdom
did
this
during

in
the
gulf
and

but
the
surge
in

was
only
sustained
for
a
few
months
