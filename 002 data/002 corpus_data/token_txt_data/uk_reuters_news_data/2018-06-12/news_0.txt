washington
reuters
the
interior
department
has
been
unable
to
adequately
explain
why
it
canceled
a
million
study
on
the
public
health
impacts
of
mountaintop
removal
coal
mining
the
agency
s
inspector
general
office
said
in
a
report
released
on
tuesday
interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
canceled
the
study
on
the
health
impacts
of
the
controversial
mining
technique
used
in
appalachia
last
august
as
part
of
what
officials
said
was
an
review
of
grants
in
excess
of
the
study
was
by
the
national
academies
of
sciences
engineering
and
medicine
mountaintop
removal
is
a
form
of
surface
mining
in
which
explosives
are
used
to
extract
coal
from
mountaintops
and
ridgelines
it
has
raised
concern
about
impacts
on
rivers
and
streams
and
on
human
health
in
surrounding
communities
when
the
interior
department
was
asked
by
the
inspector
general
to
detail
the
reasons
for
its
decision
to
cancel
the
study
it
could
not
produce
any
evidence
of
a
formal
review
the
watchdog
said
in
its
report
departmental
officials
were
unable
to
provide
specific
criteria
used
for
their
determination
whether
to
allow
or
cease
certain
grants
and
cooperative
agreements
the
report
said
it
added
the
cancellation
wasted
some
that
had
already
been
spent
on
research
and
that
the
remaining
would
be
returned
to
the
treasury
in
interior
department
spokeswoman
heather
swift
defended
the
decision
saying
the
coal
study
was
duplicative
and
was
drawing
money
away
from
more
important
efforts
like
rebuilding
public
lands
infrastructure
and
securing
public
lands
along
the
it
may
not
sound
like
a
lot
of
money
to
house
democrats
who
continually
look
for
ways
to
spend
us
into
obliteration
she
told
reuters
in
an
email
the
obama
administration
had
launched
the
study
shortly
before
leaving
office
the
inspector
general
probe
was
triggered
by
a
request
from
representative
raul
grijalva
the
top
democrat
on
the
house
natural
resources
committee
who
has
accused
the
interior
department
of
lying
and
mishandling
taxpayer
money
a
report
this
week
by
magazine
pacific
standard
showed
that
katharine
macgregor
deputy
assistant
secretary
for
land
and
minerals
management
at
interior
was
pushing
for
the
study
to
be
suspended
after
meetings
with
coal
industry
groups
according
to
public
records
it
obtained
efforts
to
reach
macgregor
were
not
successful
the
national
mining
association
called
the
nas
report
unnecessary
and
said
existing
literature
on
mountaintop
mining
shows
it
poses
no
public
health
hazards
