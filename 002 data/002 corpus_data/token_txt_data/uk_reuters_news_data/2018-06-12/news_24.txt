monthly
consumer
inflation
rose
moderately
in
may
as
gasoline
price
increases
slowed
suggesting
the
federal
reserve
could
continue
to
gradually
raise
interest
rates
this
year
the
labor
department
s
inflation
report
was
published
ahead
of
the
start
of
the
fed
s
policy
meeting
on
tuesday
steadily
rising
inflation
and
a
tightening
labour
market
are
seen
encouraging
the
central
bank
to
hike
rates
for
a
second
time
this
year
on
wednesday
neither
too
hot
nor
too
cold
said
michael
feroli
an
economist
at
jpmorgan
in
new
york
as
such
today
s
news
won
t
change
the
terms
of
the
inflation
debate
and
is
likely
to
do
little
to
stir
the
pot
at
the
fed
the
consumer
price
index
increased
percent
last
month
also
as
food
prices
were
unchanged
that
followed
a
similar
gain
in
the
cpi
in
april
in
the
months
through
may
the
cpi
accelerated
percent
the
biggest
advance
since
february
after
rising
percent
in
april
the
surge
in
the
annual
cpi
is
largely
the
result
of
last
year
s
weak
readings
which
were
driven
by
big
declines
in
the
prices
of
cell
phone
service
plans
and
doctor
fees
falling
from
the
calculation
excluding
the
volatile
food
and
energy
components
the
cpi
rose
percent
supported
by
a
rebound
in
new
motor
vehicle
prices
and
a
pickup
in
the
cost
of
healthcare
after
edging
up
percent
in
april
that
lifted
the
increase
in
the
core
cpi
to
percent
the
largest
rise
since
february
from
percent
in
april
the
fed
tracks
a
different
inflation
measure
which
is
just
below
its
percent
target
economists
are
divided
on
whether
policymakers
will
signal
one
or
two
more
rate
hikes
in
their
statement
accompanying
the
rate
decision
on
wednesday
the
slow
but
steady
upward
pressure
on
inflation
could
tilt
a
majority
of
policymakers
to
lift
their
suggested
interest
rate
forecast
possibly
pencilling
in
two
additional
moves
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
after
almost
certainly
raising
rates
tomorrow
said
sal
guatieri
a
senior
economist
at
bmo
capital
markets
in
toronto
the
dollar
was
little
changed
against
a
basket
of
currencies
while
prices
for
treasuries
fell
slightly
stocks
on
wall
street
were
trading
higher
the
fed
s
preferred
inflation
measure
the
personal
consumption
expenditures
price
index
excluding
food
and
energy
rose
percent
on
a
basis
in
april
matching
march
s
increase
economists
expect
the
core
pce
price
index
will
breach
its
percent
target
this
year
fed
officials
have
indicated
they
would
not
be
too
concerned
with
inflation
overshooting
the
target
a
survey
by
the
nfib
on
tuesday
showed
the
share
of
small
businesses
reporting
raising
prices
hitting
it
highest
level
since
in
may
several
regional
factory
surveys
have
shown
manufacturers
paying
more
for
raw
materials
this
year
economists
expect
these
higher
costs
will
eventually
be
passed
on
to
consumers
that
together
with
an
expected
acceleration
in
wage
growth
from
a
tight
labour
market
could
boost
inflation
later
this
year
the
unemployment
rate
is
at
an
low
of
percent
there
is
inflation
out
there
on
the
horizon
but
it
is
largely
a
mirage
policymakers
think
will
disappear
when
the
economy
gets
there
