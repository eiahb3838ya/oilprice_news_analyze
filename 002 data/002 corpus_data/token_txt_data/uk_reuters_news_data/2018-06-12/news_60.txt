china
s
decision
to
curb
solar
power
capacity
growth
and
cut
subsidies
will
help
the
sector
focus
on
quality
rather
than
quantity
and
ease
the
financial
burden
on
the
government
an
energy
official
said
in
an
interview
with
state
news
agency
xinhua
the
country
s
planning
agency
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
that
it
would
cut
subsidies
and
approve
no
more
than
gigawatts
gw
of
new
capacity
this
year
as
it
tried
to
ensure
that
grid
transmission
capabilities
could
keep
up
with
the
vast
number
of
new
projects
being
commissioned
but
china
s
solar
panel
manufacturers
last
week
urged
authorities
to
rethink
the
plan
saying
it
would
damage
the
sector
at
a
critical
time
in
its
development
some
manufacturers
were
already
facing
closure
as
a
result
of
overcapacity
wang
bohua
of
the
china
photovoltaic
industry
association
said
in
april
however
the
unnamed
energy
official
told
xinhua
that
while
the
new
measures
might
hurt
they
were
a
price
worth
paying
the
costs
of
solving
the
difficulties
facing
the
photovoltaic
industry
are
now
much
lower
than
the
costs
would
have
been
after
the
recent
bubble
the
official
was
quoted
as
saying
the
policies
would
help
relieve
a
massive
subsidy
backlog
now
estimated
at
around
billion
yuan
billion
with
the
finance
ministry
struggling
to
find
the
funds
to
support
the
vast
number
of
new
projects
if
this
abnormal
increase
in
capacity
continued
the
subsidy
gap
would
widen
further
and
have
an
even
more
unfavorable
impact
he
said
china
s
solar
capacity
rose
by
a
record
gw
in
bringing
the
total
to
gw
by
the
end
of
the
year
solar
makes
up
about
percent
of
china
s
total
generation
capacity
the
story
corrects
percentage
from
percent
to
percent
