exclusive-exxon mobil breaks with past, bulks up energy trading to boost profit
reuters
exxon
mobil
corp
is
pushing
deeper
into
energy
trading
building
a
global
cadre
of
experienced
traders
and
beefing
up
systems
to
lift
profit
according
to
executive
recruiters
and
people
familiar
with
the
business
the
development
is
a
sea
change
for
a
company
that
has
stood
out
from
rivals
by
limiting
its
past
activity
out
of
concern
it
would
be
accused
of
market
manipulation
exxon
now
aims
to
trade
around
more
of
its
growing
energy
assets
to
get
the
best
prices
for
its
products
and
increase
earnings
according
to
an
employee
familiar
with
the
matter
expanded
trading
could
add
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
annual
earnings
from
its
own
buying
and
selling
of
crude
and
fuels
but
also
comes
with
problems
including
higher
risk
exxon
expects
to
add
million
barrels
per
day
of
output
over
the
next
several
years
as
new
oilfields
and
refinery
expansions
kick
in
giving
it
more
assets
to
trade
exxon
last
year
retained
john
masek
a
former
trader
at
glencore
the
world
s
second
largest
buyer
and
seller
of
petroleum
to
consult
on
gasoline
trading
earlier
this
year
it
poached
four
gasoline
market
specialists
from
refiner
phillips
this
month
exxon
hired
former
bhp
billiton
plc
trader
nelson
lee
as
an
international
crude
trader
the
people
familiar
with
the
matter
said
in
lee
orchestrated
bhp
s
crude
exports
by
maintaining
the
lightly
refined
oil
met
criteria
for
an
exportable
product
the
deals
helped
usher
in
the
end
to
a
prohibition
on
crude
exports
more
than
a
year
later
the
company
has
also
added
crude
products
and
liquefied
natural
gas
specialists
to
london
and
singapore
offices
it
recently
hired
paul
butcher
a
trader
who
has
worked
at
bp
plc
glencore
and
vitol
to
advise
on
north
sea
markets
and
accounting
for
trading
transactions
paul
is
known
for
being
a
very
aggressive
old
school
crude
trader
exxon
would
have
never
hired
a
risk
taker
of
that
scale
in
the
old
days
the
fact
that
he
is
consulting
them
shows
they
are
considering
changes
in
trading
very
seriously
said
a
trading
house
executive
who
knows
butcher
phillips
declined
to
comment
on
the
employee
departures
exxon
spokesman
scott
silvestri
referred
questions
about
its
trading
business
and
recent
hiring
to
regulatory
filings
which
note
the
historical
use
of
financial
derivatives
and
geographic
scale
to
manage
commodity
price
risks
chief
executive
darren
woods
wants
to
increase
exxon
s
profit
and
appetite
for
risk
at
a
measured
pace
according
to
people
who
deal
with
exxon
the
operation
runs
from
a
trading
floor
at
its
spring
texas
campus
that
has
expanded
to
as
many
as
workers
who
will
handle
everything
from
canadian
crude
to
gasoline
jet
fuel
and
diesel
trading
has
been
a
virtual
word
at
exxon
said
ehud
ronn
a
university
of
texas
finance
professor
who
studies
energy
and
financial
risk
management
exxon
has
drawn
most
top
managers
from
engineering
backgrounds
not
financial
services
a
change
in
their
trading
policy
would
indeed
be
exxon
has
long
lagged
behind
rivals
bp
plc
chevron
corp
and
royal
dutch
shell
plc
which
have
created
trading
units
that
occasionally
generate
more
profit
than
their
refining
businesses
during
the
oil
price
downturn
of
companies
like
shell
often
made
more
profit
in
refining
than
in
oil
production
also
known
as
upstream
and
often
cited
trading
as
contributing
to
the
success
of
the
refining
division
shell
for
example
trades
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
or
percent
of
global
production
twice
the
size
of
its
own
or
exxon
s
output
the
huge
figures
come
partially
thanks
to
trading
barrels
of
third
parties
which
exxon
currently
does
on
a
very
limited
scale
exxon
would
also
normally
hedge
only
cargoes
going
from
one
region
to
another
and
where
crude
is
priced
according
to
different
benchmarks
bp
and
shell
would
normally
hedge
all
cargoes
as
well
as
taking
sometimes
a
pure
speculative
position
on
the
paper
market
to
make
profit
according
to
traders
working
for
the
firms
exxon
still
doesn
t
plan
to
begin
speculative
paper
trading
said
one
source
familiar
with
exxon
s
thinking
woods
faces
pressure
from
exxon
investors
to
lift
shares
that
trade
at
the
same
price
as
years
ago
he
promised
shareholders
this
year
that
he
can
double
profit
and
increase
its
oil
and
gas
output
by
percent
by
the
company
s
expanded
focus
on
trading
brings
challenges
including
added
risk
from
options
swaps
and
other
derivatives
and
developing
and
compensation
systems
for
the
larger
business
exxon
has
held
talks
with
at
least
two
developers
of
software
enuit
llc
and
allegro
development
corp
people
familiar
with
the
discussions
said
both
offer
packages
that
manage
logistics
and
measure
financial
exposure
the
companies
declined
to
comment
on
their
discussions
with
exxon
according
to
spokespeople
exxon
has
also
put
company
veteran
managers
in
charge
of
overall
trading
and
risk
controls
at
its
spring
texas
floor
one
person
familiar
with
its
operations
said
to
avoid
potential
losses
as
it
expands
trading
we
ve
heard
whispers
in
the
market
about
this
for
a
few
years
so
it
s
great
to
see
them
finally
hiring
commercial
talent
externally
said
an
executive
recruiter
familiar
with
some
of
the
recent
hires
but
who
was
not
directly
involved
