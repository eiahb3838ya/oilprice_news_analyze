oil
prices
were
mixed
on
tuesday
with
crude
settling
higher
before

in
trading
and
brent
slipping
as
investors
prepared
for
a
key
meeting
of
the
opec
producer
group
next
week
brent
crude
futures
fell
cents
to
settle
at
a
barrel
while
west
texas
intermediate
crude
futures
climbed
cents
to
in
trading
however
wti
turned
negative
while
brent
extended
losses
after
data
from
the
american
petroleum
institute
showed
a
surprise
build
of
barrels
in
crude
stockpiles
analysts
had
expected
a
decline
of
million
barrels
a
stronger
dollar
and
euro
weakness
was
putting
some
pressure
on
brent
prices
said
phillip
streible
senior
market
strategist
at
rjo
futures
a
strong
dollar
makes
oil
more
expensive
for
holders
of
other
currencies
i
was
looking
for
an
up
day
for
wti
in
just
a
few
weeks
it
had
fallen
from
around
a
barrel
to
and
even
for
the
window
of
seasonal
decline
that
s
a
big
move
to
go
uncorrected
said
walter
zimmerman
chief
technical
analyst
at
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
released
its
monthly
report
on
tuesday
saying
a
high
degree
of
uncertainty
was
hanging
over
the
global
oil
market
opec
and
other
producing
countries
including
russia
have
cut
oil
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
since
january
in
an
effort
to
boost
the
market
opec
holds
its
next
meeting
on
june
and
is
expected
to
decide
on
future
supply
policy
with
sanctions
threatening
to
cut
iranian
exports
and
the
potential
for
more
declines
in
venezuelan
production
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
indicated
they
would
be
willing
to
make
up
for
any
supply
shortfall
production
meanwhile
is
expected
to
rise
by
less
than
previously
expected
to
million
barrels
per
day
next
year
the
energy
information
administration
said
still
opec
said
the
outlook
for
the
second
half
of
is
highly
uncertain
even
though
the
group
s
figures
show
a
global
glut
is
gone
on
monday
iraq
s
oil
minister
said
producers
should
not
be
influenced
by
pressure
to
pump
more
oil
nonetheless
many
analysts
expect
opec
to
decide
to
hike
production
i
feel
that
if
they
would
like
to
be
a
responsible
swing
producer
for
the
global
oil
market
based
on
their
demand
numbers
they
should
increase
production
by
at
least
million
bpd
from
the
current
level
