special report-oil output goes awol in venezuela as soldiers run pdvsa
caracas
reuters
last
july
major
general
manuel
quevedo
joined
his
wife
a
catholic
priest
and
a
gathering
of
oil
workers
in
prayer
in
a
conference
room
at
the
headquarters
of
petroleos
de
venezuela
sa
or
pdvsa
the
career
military
officer
who
for
the
past
year
has
been
boss
at
the
troubled
oil
company
was
at
no
ordinary
mass
the
gathering
rather
was
a
ceremony
at
which
he
and
other
senior
oil
ministry
officials
asked
god
to
boost
oil
output
this
place
of
peace
and
spirituality
read
a
release
by
the
oil
ministry
that
was
later
scrubbed
from
its
web
site
was
the
site
of
prayer
by
workers
for
the
recovery
of
production
of
the
president
nicolas
maduro
turned
heads
in
november
when
he
named
a
national
guard
general
with
no
oil
experience
to
lead
pdvsa
quevedo
s
actions
since
have
raised
even
more
doubts
that
he
and
the
other
military
brass
now
running
the
company
have
a
viable
plan
to
rescue
it
from
crushing
debt
an
exodus
of
workers
and
withering
production
now
at
its
lowest
in
almost
seven
decades
aside
from
beseeching
heaven
quevedo
in
recent
months
has
enacted
a
series
of
controversial
measures
that
oil
industry
experts
pdvsa
employees
and
contractors
and
even
everyday
citizens
say
are
pushing
the
and
respected
company
towards
ruin
soldiers
with
under
orders
to
prevent
cheating
on
manifests
now
board
tankers
to
accompany
cargo
inspectors
rattling
foreign
captains
and
crews
workers
who
make
mistakes
operating
increasingly
dilapidated
pdvsa
equipment
now
face
the
risk
of
arrest
and
charges
of
sabotage
or
corruption
military
chieftains
moonlighting
in
the
private
sector
are
elbowing
past
other
contractors
for
lucrative
service
and
supply
business
with
pdvsa
in
a
reversal
of
the
socialist
government
s
drive
to
nationalize
the
industry
the
lack
of
expertise
among
military
managers
is
leading
pdvsa
to
hire
outsiders
to
keep
afloat
even
basic
operations
like
drilling
and
pumping
oil
to
the
dismay
of
many
familiar
with
venezuela
s
oil
industry
some
of
the
contracts
are
going
to
small
firms
with
no
experience
in
the
sector
combined
industry
veterans
say
the
steps
leave
venezuela
s
most
important
company
which
accounts
for
over
percent
of
export
revenue
with
even
fewer
means
to
rebuild
the
nation
s
coffers
pay
its
many
creditors
and
regain
as
an
oil
producer
what
we
are
witnessing
is
a
policy
of
destroying
the
oil
industry
said
jose
bodas
general
secretary
of
the
oil
workers
federation
a
national
labor
union
the
military
officials
don
t
listen
to
workers
they
want
to
give
orders
but
they
don
t
understand
this
complicated
maduro
defends
the
military
managers
arguing
they
are
more
in
synch
with
his
socialist
worldview
than
capitalist
industry
professionals
who
exploit
the
country
for
personal
profit
i
want
a
socialist
pdvsa
the
president
told
allied
legislators
earlier
this
year
an
ethical
sovereign
and
productive
pdvsa
we
must
break
this
model
of
the
rentier
oil
quevedo
who
holds
the
title
of
oil
minister
as
well
as
president
of
pdvsa
didn
t
respond
to
requests
for
comment
for
this
story
neither
venezuela
s
information
ministry
responsible
for
communications
for
the
government
and
senior
officials
nor
pdvsa
s
press
office
returned
phone
calls
or
emails
from
reuters
pdvsa
and
the
oil
ministry
disclose
scant
information
about
quevedo
who
is
according
to
his
social
security
registration
he
seldom
makes
public
speeches
but
at
an
industry
event
in
vienna
last
june
quevedo
told
journalists
pdvsa
is
aware
of
its
challenges
and
hoped
within
months
to
make
up
for
plummeting
output
we
hope
by
year
end
to
recover
the
lost
production
he
said
in
a
forecast
that
has
been
missed
we
have
the
capacity
and
we
have
summoned
the
strength
of
the
nearly
years
after
the
late
hugo
chavez
launched
his
bolivarian
revolution
much
of
venezuela
is
in
tatters
food
and
medicines
are
scarce
hyperinflation
has
gutted
purchasing
power
for
increasingly
desperate
citizens
and
roughly
three
million
venezuelans
have
fled
the
country
in
search
of
a
better
life
at
pdvsa
managers
long
sought
to
keep
the
company
running
even
if
the
economic
meltdown
and
falling
oil
prices
meant
they
had
fewer
resources
to
invest
in
exploration
growth
and
basic
maintenance
despite
their
efforts
decay
led
to
dwindling
production
deteriorating
facilities
and
a
progressive
loss
of
skilled
workers
now
critics
say
military
officials
atop
pdvsa
have
put
aside
any
pretense
of
running
it
like
a
proper
business
doing
little
to
stem
the
fall
in
production
or
improve
the
company
s
financial
operational
and
staffing
problems
no
matter
the
dysfunction
pdvsa
remains
a
rare
and
crucial
source
of
foreign
currency
in
the
enfeebled
andean
country
for
maduro
who
became
president
after
chavez
died
in
handing
the
company
over
to
the
military
is
seen
by
many
as
a
calculated
move
to
buy
loyalty
from
officers
no
one
will
be
able
to
remove
the
military
from
pdvsa
now
said
rafael
ramirez
a
former
oil
minister
ramirez
ran
the
company
for
a
decade
under
chavez
before
clashing
with

who
accuses
him
and
many
other
former

of
corruption

for

pdvsa
s
financial
problems
are
likely
to

much
of
his
attention

at

the
scant

left
on

the
shift
toward
military
management
was
the
result
of
a
purge
of
pdvsa
leadership
allegations
of
corruption
have
been
rife
across
the
venezuelan
government
in
recent
years
maduro
himself
is
the
target
of
sanctions
for
graft
and
human

violations
which
he
denies
in

leveled
his
own
accusations
against
pdvsa
describing
it
as
a
den
of
he
accused
many
former

of
skimming
from
contracts
and
laundering
money
and
argued
that
their
graft

of

a
stocky

balding
man
with
heavy
eyebrows
reviewing

with
the

or
smiling
happily
alongside
him
his

consists
almost
exclusively
of
retweets
of
maduro

since
the

has
moved
between

as

at

those

for

at

and

created
by

and
people
who
know
his

quevedo
led

that
clashed
with

during
protests
that

venezuela
for
four
months
at
least
people
on
both
sides
died
during
the
demonstrations
sparked
by
the
onset
of
food

quevedo
was
criticized
by
many
government
opponents
for
using
excessive
force
which
he
denied
he
appeared
frequently
on
state
television
at
the
time
donning
an
helmet
and

these
are
terrorist
groups
he
said
of
the

who
eventually
dissipated
leading
him
to
declare
that
the
coup
has
been
pleased
with
quevedo
s
performance
maduro
in
named
him
housing
minister
in
his
two
years
in

on
state

often
wearing
the
red

of
the
socialist

and
praising

humane
housing
policies
opposition
leaders
scoffed
at
what
they
saw
as
quevedo
s
outsized
boasts
including
an
unsubstantiated
claim
that

constructed
more

made
clear
the
challenge
ahead
in
a
public
address
during
powerhouse
venezuela
a
government
conference
meant
to
showcase
business
potential
the
president
ordered
quevedo
to
boost
oil
output
by
a
whopping
million
barrels
per
day
roughly
a
percent
increase
at
the
time
over
the
past
year
though
quevedo
has
failed
to
reverse
the
slide
one
of
his
first
challenges
according
to
people
within
pdvsa
was
to
stanch
the
flow
of
workers
many
of
whom
deserted
the
company
and
venezuela
altogether
pdvsa
hasn
t
disclosed
recent
employment
figures
but
estimates
by
ipd
latin
america
an
oil
and
gas
consultancy
indicate
pdvsa
has
about
workers
percent
fewer
than
in
because
of
increases
that
now
top
million
percent
per
year
according
to
venezuela
s
national
assembly
pdvsa
salaries
have
crumbled
to
the
equivalent
of
a
handful
of
dollars
a
month
for
most
workers
with
no
money
and
little
real
work
to
do
at
idle
and
faulty

venezuela

of
the

rifles
could
spark
fires
and
complain
that
some
of

crime
afflicting
the
country
is
making
its
way
on

although
quevedo
has
tasked
the
soldiers
to

many
posts
from
the
processing
of

the

is
hobbling
the

in
a

pdv

the

said
staffing

critical
state
on

forcing
some
workers
to
toil
far
more
than
allowed
by
union
rules
the
alarming
deficit
of
main
staff
the
report
read
means
we
can
not
honor
labor
tensions
with
military
managers
are
causing
even
more
departures
some
workers
say
consider
an
incident
in
june
when
two

docked
at

prepared
to
take
on
heavy
crude
the
other
a

grade
of

as
the

pdvsa
port
employees
noticed
a
mixup
the
two
crudes
had
blended
the
mistake
the
government
said
later
forced
pdvsa
to
pay
the
buyers
because
of
contractual
penalties
million
it
would
also
be
costly
for
nine
pdvsa
employees
shortly
after
the
error
soldiers
and
intelligence
agents
arrested
the
workers
and
prosecutors
charged
them
with
sabotage
this
was
premeditated
said
tarek

announcing
the
arrests
on

the
actions
go
beyond
negligence
there
was
malice
after
three
days
in
an
overcrowded
military
jail
they
were
released
pending
trial
two
workers
in
the
oil
industry
familiar
with
their
case
said
poor
maintenance
not
sabotage
caused
the
mishap
a
faulty
valve
system
flimsy
after
years
without
upkeep
caused
the

to
mix
they
said
six
months
later
the

no
evidence
against
the
workers
reuters
was
unable
to
reach
the
accused
or
to
independently
determine
the
cause
of
the
mishap
colleagues
said
the
workers
are
under
orders
not
to
speak
publicly
of
the
incident
the
arrests
have
rattled
pdvsa
employees
especially
because
soldiers
and
intelligence
agents
have
also
detained
workers
at
other
facilities
after
mistakes
in
july
four
pdvsa
employees
were
arrested
after
crude
spilled
into
a
river
near
an
oilfield
in
the
state
of
monagas
according
to
workers
and
media
accounts
there
one
worker
in
monagas
told
reuters
that
faulty
turbines
caused
the
spill
and
that
a
vehicle
shortage
kept
employees
from
reaching
the
site
to
stem
the
flow
we
don
t
understand
how
a
lack
of
resources
becomes
an
excuse
to
accuse
workers
of
negligence
or
sabotage
he
said
they
re
being
asked
to
work
without
safety
equipment
tools
even
without
being
able
to
feed
themselves
or
their
quevedo
has
been
creating
new
partnerships
that
are
meant
to
shore
up
pdvsa
in
august
for

the
general
said
the
company
was
opening
its
doors
for
seven
private
companies
to
pursue
unspecified
service
contracts
across
the
country
the
move
raised
eyebrows
here
because
it
ran
counter
to
longstanding
efforts
to
nationalize
the
entire
industry
chavez
himself
phased
out
similar
contracts
arguing
that
they
enriched
private
enterprise
for
work
that
the
state
should
do
itself
according
to
a
document
seen
by
reuters
the
companies
obtained
agreements
to
operate
oilfields
on
behalf
of
pdvsa
in
return
for
boosting
output
financing
investments
and
procuring
equipment
but
the
companies
are
unfamiliar
even
to
veterans
of
