surged
on
wednesday
posting
its
strongest
daily
gain
in
more
than
two
years
in
a
partial
rebound
from
steep
losses
that
pushed
crude
benchmarks
to
lows
not
seen
since
both

brent
crude
rose
about
percent
their
largest
increase
since
when
opec
signed
a
landmark

cut
production

crude
has
been
caught
up
in
wider
market
weakness
as
the
government
shutdown
higher
interest
rates
and
the
trade
dispute
unnerved
investors
and
exacerbated
worries
over
global
growth

market
is
still
really
concerned
about
demand

trading
is
marked
by

recent
selling
has
felt
less
fundamentally
driven
and
more
a
function
of
the
overall

meltdown
as
