dubai
reuters
saudi
aramco
is
establishing
a
domestic
fuel
retailing
subsidiary
as
part
of
the
national
oil
company
s
drive
to
expand
beyond
crude
oil
production
into
downstream
businesses
the
new
firm
saudi
aramco
retail
co
will
create
a
network
of
filling
stations
within
saudi
arabia
to
sell
automotive
fuels
aramco
said
on
wednesday
without
giving
details
of
the
size
cost
or
for
the
network
in
april
aramco
said
it
had
signed
a
memorandum
of
understanding
with
french
firm
total
to
evaluate
the
feasibility
of
jointly
buying
a
retail
service
station
network
in
saudi
arabia
but
wednesday
s
statement
did
not
mention
total
or
the
possibility
of
buying
existing
stations
the
new
saudi
network
will
complement
a
global
retail
network
which
aramco
already
operates
through
joint
ventures
the
company
said
in
the
long
run
the
new
retail
subsidiary
could
help
saudi
authorities
conduct
an
initial
public
offer
of
shares
in
aramco
plans
to
sell
percent
of
aramco
were
suspended
this
year
partly
because
it
became
clear
riyadh
was
unlikely
to
achieve
the
trillion
valuation
for
the
company
that
it
wanted
aramco
is
now
focusing
on
a
range
of
downstream
projects
including
the
purchase
of
a
major
stake
in
petrochemical
producer
saudi
basic
industries
which
could
boost
its
value
and
attractiveness
to
international
investors
ultimately
allowing
the
ipo
to
go
ahead
