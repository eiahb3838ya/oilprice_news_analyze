two
days
ago
president
donald
trump
described
the
fed
as
the
only
problem
our
economy
has
as
the
central
bank
raises
interest
rates
investors
have
been
unnerved
by
the
potential
for
weaker
economic
growth
and
a
partial
federal
government
shutdown
trump
has
largely
laid
the
blame
for
economic
headwinds
on
the
fed
openly
criticizing
a
chairman
he
appointed
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
also
raised
market
concerns
by
convening
a
crisis
group
following
the
sharp
pullback
in
stocks
one
economist
said
the
fed
holds
the
key
to
calming
markets
in
the
end
we
believe
that
the
fed
is
the
only
presence
capable
of
ending
the
current
confusion
in
the
markets
kenta
inoue
senior
market
economist
at
mitsubishi
ufj
morgan
stanley
securities
said
in
a
note
the
white
house
will
probably
keep
making
gestures
intended
to
halt
the
rout
in
stocks
but
the
federal
government
is
likely
to
remain
shut
into
the
new
year
the
trade
war
also
shows
no
signs
of
a

inc
report
that
sales
during
the
holiday
shopping
season
rose
percent
to
over
billion
in
the
strongest
in
the
past
six
years
helped
stocks
as
did
the
higher
crude
prices
investors
also
often
sell
assets
that
have
done
the
best
and
buy
those
that
have
done
the
worst
at
the
end
of
the
quarter
to
rebalance
to
a
target
position
the
dow

rose
points

points
or

the

in
price
to

said
in
a
note
as
investors
react
to
a
fed
tightening
policy
and
rising
rates
we
think
we
ll
recognise
the
signs
when
sustainable
trend
reversals
have
been
established
and
at
the
moment
we
see
none
of
those
meanwhile
a

that
lifted
the
japanese
