rpt-column-strange days for coal with glencore's cap, china curbs: russell

it
s
been
weird
in
the
coal
world
in
recent
days
with
the
world
s
largest
shipper
saying
it
s
capping
output
biggest
seaborne
buyer
china
putting
restrictions
on
some
imports
and
an
australian
court
saying
mines
must
factor
in
climate
change
throw
in
an
executive
at
a
major
indian
power
generator
saying
his
company
won
t
build
any
new
plants
as
coal
can
t
compete
with
renewables
and
it
s
little
surprise
that
environmental
activists
may
be
tempted
to
pop
champagne
corks
the
common
theme
at
work
is
that
coal
is
finding
it
harder
to
secure
a
future
in
the
world
s
energy
mix
but
it
s
worth
unpacking
the
various
developments
and
assessing
the
likely
real
impacts
beyond
public
relations
spin
the
most
significant
development
this
week
was
glencore
s
announcement
on
that
it
will
cap
its
annual
output
around
its
current
capacity
of
million
tonnes
glencore
is
the
world
s
coal
mining
company
but
also
the
largest
supplier
to
the
seaborne
market
as
miners
that
produce
more
coal
india
china
shenhua
energy
and
peabody
energy
of
the
united
states
are
focused
on
their
domestic
markets
glencore
said
it
was
taking
the
step
to
help
mitigate
climate
change
prompting
commentators
and
activists
to
claim
another
victory
in
the
campaign
to
end
burning
of
the
polluting
fuel
while
glencore
may
genuinely
be
trying
to
do
its
part
to
halt
global
warming
it
s
also
likely
the
mining
giant
has
calculated
that
restricting
coal
output
will
be
good
for
business
it
is
accepted
that
coal
consumption
is
likely
to
drop
in
the
coming
decades
to
virtually
nothing
in
europe
and
north
america
and
will
even
start
to
decline
in
asia
but
glencore
has
probably
calculated
that
this
will
be
a
slow
profitable
death
and
is
positioning
itself
to
take
advantage
while
overall
coal
consumption
is
important
for
climate
considerations
glencore
s
interest
lies
in
the
seaborne
market
and
it
s
here
that
business
may
actually
be
good
for
an
extended
period
even
as
overall
coal
demand
drops
the
seaborne
market
is
set
to
become
tighter
especially
in
asia
as
more
countries
in
the
region
build
generators
that
rely
on
imported
fuel
countries
on
this
list
include
malaysia
pakistan
the
philippines
and
others
in
southeast
and
south
asia
the
world
s
three
biggest
exporters
of
coal
however
all
have
various
reasons
as
to
why
they
may
not
be
able
to
supply
much
more
than
they
ship
now
indonesia
the
world
s
biggest
shipper
of
thermal
coal
used
in
power
plants
has
a
domestic
reservation
policy
that
forecasts
declining
exports
as
more
fuel
is
diverted
to
feed
local
generators
australia
the
biggest
exporter
of
coking
coal
used
to
make
steel
and
number
two
in
thermal
coal
may
find
it
hard
to
boost
its
shipments
given
increasing
domestic
opposition
to
the
industry
and
the
difficulties
in
getting
new
mines
approved
financed
and
insured
south
africa
the
exporter
has
capacity
constraints
in
its
rail
system
and
is
also
trying
to
balance
the
needs
of
its
home
market
against
the
desirability
of
earning
foreign
exchange
through
exports
glencore
which
spent
some
billion
last
year
on
coal
mines
in
australia
has
also
probably
acquired
all
the
assets
it
needs
in
the
coal
sector
its
mission
now
is
to
operate
these
mines
efficiently
and
to
try
and
ensure
that
prices
remain
as
high
as
possible
it
may
be
cynical
but
one
way
to
do
that
is
to
say
the
company
will
cap
output
thereby
helping
to
keep
the
seaborne
market
tight
and
prices
elevated
china
is
showing
that
two
can
play
that
game
with
customs
at
the
northern
port
of
dalian
placing
an
indefinite
ban
on
imports
from
australia
and
restricting
those
from
other
countries
according
to
an
exclusive
reuters
report
on
thursday
this
isn
t
the
first
time
china
has
taken
such
measures
and
the
most
likely
outcome
is
that
imports
will
decline
for
a
period
of
time
but
may
eventually
recover
much
of
the
coal
china
imports
from
australia
is
coking
coal
and
this
is
harder
to
source
from
other
countries
with
the
only
real
alternatives
being
canada
and
the
united
states
what
is
clearer
is
that
china
the
world
s
biggest
coal
importer
wants
to
limit
its
total
imports
which
means
that
over
time
it
s
unlikely
to
be
much
of
a
growth
market
india
the
coal
importer
looms
as
a
great
hope
for
the
sector
but
the
coaltrans
india
conference
this
week
in
new
delhi
showed
that
while
imports
may
grow
this
year
and
next
a
dearth
of
new
projects
and
the
likely
eventual
improvement
of
domestic
coal
availability
should
result
in
a
shrinking
market
coal
plants
are
struggling
to
compete
against
wind
and
solar
in
india
with
rajit
desai
an
executive
at
major
private
generator
tata
power
telling
the
conference
that
his
company
wasn
t
looking
at
developing
any
new
plants
and
will
instead
focus
on
buying
existing
units
that
are
effectively
distressed
assets
in
another
apparent
victory
for
climate
activists
an
australian
court
ruled
on
that
a
mine
development
couldn
t
go
ahead
citing
the
impact
from
the
greenhouse
emissions
that
would
be
created
while
the
mine
in
question
most
likely
would
have
been
rejected
on
other
grounds
such
as
its
close
proximity
to
a
retirement
complex
the
court
nonetheless
signalled
that
climate
mitigation
may
become
a
part
of
any
future
approval
process
putting
the
recent
developments
together
gives
a
picture
of
a
fuel
battered
from
all
sides
but
there
is
always
a
caveat
in
this
case
it
s
simply
that
vast
numbers
of
power
plants
in
asia
are
still
in
the
early
stages
of
useful
lives
and
will
likely
operate
for
decades
to
come
coal
may
be
down
but
it
s
far
from
out
i
m
sure
glencore
s
canny
chief
executive
ivan
glasenberg
would
agree
