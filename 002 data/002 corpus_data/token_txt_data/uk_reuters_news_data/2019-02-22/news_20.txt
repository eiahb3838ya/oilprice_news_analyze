crude
inventories
in
west
texas
dropped
this

to
the
lowest
in
four
months
after
a
converted

began
transporting
crude
from
the
nation
s
biggest
shale
oil
field
to
the
gulf
coast
data
from
market
intelligence
provider
genscape
showed
the
drop
in
storage
in
the
permian
basin
is
another
sign
that
new
pipelines
out
of
the
region
have
begun
to
alleviate
a
crude
bottleneck
that
depressed
local
crude
prices
as
production
overwhelmed
pipeline
capacity
and
filled
storage
tanks
crude
inventories
in
the
permian
basin
fell
to
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
the
lowest
since
october
and
down
from
a
record
million
barrels
in

that
glut
had
doubled
in
size
from
million
barrels
in
june
according
to
the
genscape

decline
began
in

midland

output
is
expected
to
hit
million

a

the

projected
this

the
next
outbound
pipeline
capacity
expansions
are
not
expected
until
the
third

of
potentially
leading
to
further
constraints

three
major
pipelines
transporting
more
than
million
bpd
from
the

the

producers
responding
to

and
pipeline
constraints
have
idled
