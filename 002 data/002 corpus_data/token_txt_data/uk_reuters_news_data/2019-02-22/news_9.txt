reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
said
on
friday
it
has
agreed
to
conduct
a
study
to
assess
the
impact
that
burning
ethanol
as
a
motor
vehicle
fuel
has
on
air
quality
the
sierra
club
had
filed
a
lawsuit
against
the
epa
late
last
year
in
an
effort
to
compel
the
agency
to
conduct
the
study
which
the
group
said
was
supposed
to
be
done
roughly
eight
years
ago
the
two
parties
reached
a
partial
agreement
and
the
epa
said
it
will
conduct
the
study
by
march
of
the
outcome
of
the
study
could
trigger
new
epa
action
on
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
the
law
requiring
the
use
of
biofuels
in
the
nation
s
gasoline
and
diesel
if
it
finds
that
burning
ethanol
makes
the
air
dirtier
the
rfs
first
established
in
has
been
a
financial
boon
for
farmers
but
environmental
groups
like
sierra
club
say
it
creates
an
incentive
to
convert
land
for
farming
and
helps
maintain
a
dependence
on
combustible
engines
