after
meeting
with
top
officials
of
the
embattled
administration
of
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
about
the
latest
oil
sanctions
upon
landing
in
the
bahamas
where
chavez
has
worked
for
about
a
year
after
being
denied
a
visa
he
had
received
word
from
houston
that
it
would
be
his
last
trip
on
a
company
plane
and
that
his
citgo
email
account
had
been
shut
off
control
of
the
company

passed
to
citgo
s
top
executive
rick
esser
who
with
the
backing
of
venezuela
s
rising
political
opposition
and
the
government
would
begin
clearing
the
way
for
a
new
board
of
directors
at
citgo
esser
oversaw
the
moves
to
isolate
chavez
a
cousin
of
the
late
venezuelan
president
hugo
chavez
and
would
soon
start
ousting
other
citgo
executives
close
to
the
maduro
administration
the
at
the
prized
subsidiary
of
venezuela
s
oil
firm
petroleos
de
venezuela
pdvsa
marked
a
crucial
early
victory
for
the
country
s
rising
opposition
government
led
by
president
juan
guaido
as
it
struggles
to
remove
maduro
from
office
and
break
his
grip
on
the
opec
nation
s
oil
assets
the
account
of
the
transition
of
power
at
citgo
is
based
on
reuters
interviews
with
more
than
a
dozen
current
and
former
citgo
and
pdvsa
executives
employees
and
and
latin
american
advisors
guaido
head
of
the
nation
s
congress
announced
he
would
seize
the
presidency
on
because
maduro
s
last
year
was
a
sham
rendering
the
socialist
leader
illegitimate
under
venezuela
law
guaido
s
claim
to
interim
leadership
until
fair
elections
can
be
held
was
quickly
backed
by
the
united
states
and
dozens
of
other
nations
but
maduro
remains
in
control
of
the
nation
s
military
and
pdvsa
making
citgo
the
obvious
first
target
among
national
asset
for
guaido
s
opposition
movement
to
claim
with
the
help
of
the
government
the
battle
for
citgo
could
prove
pivotal
in
the
effort
to
unseat
maduro
because
full
control
of
a
major
refiner
would
provide
a
crucial
source
of
revenue
to
a
administration
citgo
with
more
than
billion
in
annual
sales
and
operations
that
supply
about
percent
of
fuels
may
be
the
last
remaining
asset
owned
by
pdvsa
with
a
healthy
balance
sheet
as
pdvsa
s
oil
production
and
revenue
have
plummeted
amid
crippling
debt
mismanagement
and
international
political
pressure
citgo
s
location
and
financial
independence
have
shielded
the
firm
from
the
worst
of
its
parent
company
s
meltdown
at
the
end
of
september
citgo
had
net
income
of
about
million
according
to
a
creditor
with
access
to
financial
statements
that
are
not
public
the
company
had
almost
million
in
cash
and
an
available
credit

of
million

houston
headquarters
many
employees
weary
of
operating
under
the
control
of
a
failing
socialist

together
for
the
first
time
in

and
named
executives
to
replace
those
who
were
ousted
according
to
two
citgo
employees
with
knowledge
of
the
board
actions
which
the
company
has
not
publicly
disclosed
we
are
not
expecting
any
resistance
to
the
new
board
inside
the
company
said
one
manager
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
on
the
contrary
we
are
waiting
for
directions
to
lay
out

loyalists
scrambled
to
find
their
place
in
the
emerging
corporate
structure
two
of
four
senior
executives
appointed
by
chavez
openly
pledged
support
for

departures
gygax
declined
to

and
the
others
did
not
respond
to
requests
it
s
unclear
whether
chavez
has
yet
been
formally
terminated
an
action
that
can
only
be
taken
by
company
directors
but
he
has
been
effectively
shut
out
of
the

essentially
run
the

close
consultation
with

officials
according
to
three
citgo
employees
and
two
people
close

the

into
the
spotlight
after

tweeted
a
photo
of
the
meeting
calling
it
very
officials
have
voiced
concern
that
guaido
and
his
supporters
had
been
too
slow
in
seizing
control
of
citgo
and
also
have
pushed
for
a
say
in
choosing
members
of
the
refiner
s
new
board
a
request
guaido
s
team
declined
according
to
two
people
familiar
with
the
talks

citgo
s
upper
ranks
of
maduro
allies
esser
has
focused
on
securing
alternatives
to
the
venezuelan
oil
that
feeds
its
refineries
recent
sanctions
prevent
the
firm
from
importing
venezuelan
crude
after
april
which
could
cripple
the
company
unless
it
can
ensure
it
has
the
cash
credit
and
contracts
for
alternate
supplies
advisors
to
the
incoming
citgo
board
have
separately
urged
officials
to
exempt
citgo
from
sanctions
and
protect
its
assets
from
creditors
once
it
is
officially
controlled
by
guaido
s
team
esser
saw
this
crisis
coming
two
years
ago
and
put
together
a
group
to
find
new
suppliers
and
test
their
oils
in
the
event
venezuelan
crudes
were
restricted
by
sanctions
according
to
a
person
familiar
with
the
effort
the
firm
s
efforts
to
sustain
operations
face
a
threat
from
creditors
owed
money
by
venezuela
and
pdvsa
who
could
try
to
use
that
leverage
to
hamstring
citgo
s
finances
said
carlos
jorda
a
former
citgo
chairman
and
now
a
houston
business
consultant
the
government
could
help
the
company
hold
off
that
threat
he
said
the
treasury
could
say
hold
your
horses
you
ll
get
paid
but
not
paid
by
citgo
but
by
venezuela
when
the

opposition

had
difficulty
recruiting
candidates
willing
to
join
the
new
citgo
board
according
to
three
people
familiar
with
the
recruitments
there
are
many
risks
one
of
the
people
said
and
if
these
people
have
family
members
in

they
could
be
putting
them
at
risk
in

headquarters
new
citgo
chairwoman
luisa
palacios
appointed
by
the
venezuelan
congress
last

has
been
huddling
with
newly

legal
advisers
to
guard
against
the
threat
of

in
aruba
said
the
two
people
close
to
palacios
pdvsa
and
citgo
agreed
to
a
million
overhaul
of
the

refining
officially
put
the
venture
on
hold
and
laid
off
workers
citing
the
impact
of

on
pdvsa
the
project
has
been
clouded
by
corruption
allegations
according
to
four
former
and
current
citgo
employees
and
two
people
close
to
the
new
citgo
board
there
is
also
worry
about
the
audits
to
come
we
are
expecting
frogs
and
snakes
to
come
from
there
said
a
citgo
employee
using
a
venezuelan
figure
of
speech
similar
in
meaning
to
the
opening
of
a
pandora
s
box
since
esser
took
over
citgo
operations
the
company
has
sent
clear
signals
of
a
return
to
its
american
roots

a
story
to
tell
