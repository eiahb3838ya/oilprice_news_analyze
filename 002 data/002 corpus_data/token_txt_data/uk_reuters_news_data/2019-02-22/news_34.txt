reuters
finland
s
nuclear
regulator
has
identified
a
safety
issue
at
olkiluoto
a
reactor
built
by
france
s
orano
and
the
problem
needs
to
be
fixed
before
the
unit
can
receive
a
permit
to
operate
the
regulator
told
reuters
the
reactor
is
due
to
start
producing
electricity
in
january
next
year
after
a
delay
part
of
the
pressurizer
a
primary
circuit
component
of
the
reactor
is
vibrating
at
levels
that
exceed
safety
limits
said
pekka
valikangas
the
regulator
s
section
head
for
nuclear
reactor
regulation
the
test
results
show
that
these
vibrations
are
not
approved
he
said
in
an
interview
this
must
be
taken
care
of
before
the
ministry
decides
on
the
permit
valikangas
said
adding
that
the
regulator
would
offer
two
options
for
a
solution
the
reactor
s
owner
finnish
consortium
tvo
and
supplier
orano
previously
known
as
areva
would
need
to
choose
from
those
options
finland
needs
the
reactor
as
it
imports
more
than
percent
of
its
electricity
from
neighboring
sweden
and
russia
while
its
energy
needs
are
growing
