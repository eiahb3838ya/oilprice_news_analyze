a

faces
a
close
contest
against
atiku
to
lead
a
country
that
has
africa
s
largest
economy
and
is
its
top
oil
producer
but
is
plagued
by
corruption
and
wide
gaps
between
rich
and
poor
the
election
has
been
fought
over
buhari
s
handling
of
the
economy
amid
fragile
growth
and
growing
unemployment
as
the
country
recovers
from
a
recession
