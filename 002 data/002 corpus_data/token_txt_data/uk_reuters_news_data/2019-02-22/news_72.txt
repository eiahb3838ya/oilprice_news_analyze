insurance not enough to offset financial risks of climate change, analysts say

from
homeowners
facing
higher
flood
insurance
premiums
to
investors
putting
money
into
power
plants
financial
risks
related
to
climate
change
are
growing
analysts
say
but
working
out
how
a
switch
to
train
travel
could
affect
an
airline
or
what
an
insurance
firm
should
do
to
weather
more
flood
claims
is
neither
clear
nor
simple
they
say
help
may
be
at
hand
however
from
guides
published
on
friday
to
assess
financial
risks
from
the
physical
threats
of
climate
change
as
well
as
the
risks
and
opportunities
of
a
global
transition
away
from
fossil
fuels
what
is
the
exposure
financial
institutions
have
to
natural
catastrophes
i
don
t
think
that
question
traditionally
has
been
asked
said
greg
lowe
global
head
of
resilience
and
sustainability
for
aon
a
insurance
and
risk
firm
for
disasters
there
s
always
been
an
assumption
we
have
insurance
for
that
said
lowe
whose
firm
contributed
to
the
reports
by
climatewise
an
initiative
of
the
university
of
cambridge
institute
for
sustainability
leadership
that
aims
to
better
disclose
and
respond
to
insurance
risks
with
those
risks
growing
particularly
as
emissions
continue
to
rise
traditional
methods
of
dealing
with
them
may
not
be
enough
as
the
world
tracks
toward
degrees
celsius
or
more
of
global
warming
the
twin
reports
warn
if
indeed
people
think
we
re
headed
on
that
path
past
it
s
going
to
be
a
hugely
difficult
task
for
the
financial
system
to
manage
lowe
predicted
over
the
next
years
the
risks
from
heatwaves
storm
surges
and
floods
will
increase
substantially
because
of
warming
already
underway
the
physical
threats
report
noted
in
britain
that
could
lead
to
higher
flood
insurance
premiums
and
people
more
often
made
homeless
by
floods
as
well
as
greater
investment
by
cities
and
towns
in
flood
defences
that
homeowners
understand
changing
flood
risks
and
will
respond
adequately
to
them
is
probably
a
generous
assumption
lowe
said
but
even
for
those
who
do
grasp
the
shift
simply
boosting
insurance
coverage
is
unlikely
to
be
an
answer
he
said
i
don
t
think
buying
more
insurance
is
a
politically
or
financially
sustainable
thing
to
do
he
said
even
with
insurance
this
is
still
a
tremendous
hardship
on
people
if
they
are
out
of
their
rather
there
should
be
honest
discussions
about
who
foots
the
bill
for
the
growing
risk
and
damage
he
said
someone
is
going
to
pay
for
this
how
that
gets
distributed
through
the
financial
system
is
the
question
he
added
the
new
reports
aim
to
demonstrate
that
it
is
possible
to
start
taking
a
more
precise
look
at
the
risks
and
their
financial
impacts
and
to
give
experts
tools
to
do
that
said
bronwyn
claire
senior
programme
manager
for
climatewise
for
instance
they
could
explore
how
changes
in
transport
demand
between
trains
and
planes
or
a
carbon
tax
that
is
influencing
fuel
prices
might
affect
an
airport
in
germany
the
guides
could
also
help
investors
spot
opportunities
