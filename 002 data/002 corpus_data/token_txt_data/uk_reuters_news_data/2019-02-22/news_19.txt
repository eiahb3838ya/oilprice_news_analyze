asian
spot
prices
for
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
dropped
to
new
lows
this
week
as
sporadic
spot
demand
failed
to
change
the
overall
trend
of
oversupply
in
the
market
spot
prices
for
april
delivery
to
northeast
asia
are
estimated
at
around
per
million
british
thermal

mmbtu
down

from
the
previous

bp
sold
a
cargo
to
gunvor
at
this
price
on
thursday
for

to
asia
in

japanese
utility
tohoku
electric
bought
a
cargo
in
the
market
for
april
delivery
at
a
similar
price
a
trade
source
said
there
were
several
enquiries
for
deliveries
to
china
between
late
april
and
early
may
after
traders
returned
from
the
lunar
new
year
holidays
but
overall
lng
demand
across
north
asia
remained
exceptionally
weak
sources
in
singapore
said
the
current
price
is
at
the
lowest
level
since
september
but
it
is
unlikely
to
have
reached
its
bottom
yet
i
think
when
the
price
falls
to
between
we
should
start
to
see
some
demand
creation
in
asia
a
trader
in
europe
said
adding
that
it
would
start
rebalancing
the
flow
of
cargoes
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
basins
there
were
some
offers
in
europe
from
sellers
looking
to
divert
their
cargoes
from
asia
to
europe
another
trader
said
south
korea
s
kogas
is
also
diverting
cargoes
from
its
offtake
to
europe
this
winter
with
the
latest
cargo
to
reach
britain
s
isle
of
grain
terminal
on
gas
prices
in
europe
fell
this
week
too
contributing
to
the
weakness
in
the
global
lng
market
a
stronger
oil
market
may
support
gas
prices
somewhat
but
weak
demand
and
ample
supply
are
expected
to
keep
them
generally
low
cargoes
in
europe
traded
this
week
at
around
percent
to
britain
s
gas
price
benchmark
for
delivery
into
britain
around
percent
to
the
dutch
gas
benchmark
for
delivery
to
the
netherlands
a
cent
discount
to
the
dutch
price
for
delivery
to
spain
and
a
cent
discount
to
the
dutch
price
for
delivery
to
italy
a
trader
said
a
number
of
outages
that
have
taken
place
so
far
this
year
contributed
to
at
least
missed
cargoes
but
oversupply
is
much
higher
than
that
train
at
nigeria
s
bonny
plant
was
off
this
week
after
going
offline
last
week
sources
in
europe
said

was
also
offline
last

they

in

united
states
production
recovered
after
an
outage
last
week
at
one
of
the

at

a
trade
source
said
the
train
didn
t
fall
to
zero
as
evidenced
by
still
a
lot
of
gas
trading
out
there
the

said
adding
that
current
production
levels
were
around
billion
cubic

producer
cheniere

sabine
pass
declined
to
comment
cheniere
however
could
make
a
transhipment
of
a
yamal
lng
cargo
in
europe
which
would
signify
that
the
company
may
need
to
substitute
volumes

in
maintenance

loading

the
