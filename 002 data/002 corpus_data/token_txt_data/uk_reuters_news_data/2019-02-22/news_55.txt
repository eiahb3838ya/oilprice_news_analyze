nigerian
teacher
benjamin
shagu
flew
km
miles
from
the
east
of
the
country
to
the
capital
abuja
to
vote
in
the
presidential
election
only
for
the
vote
to
be
delayed
for
a
week
just
five
hours
before
polls
had
been
due
to
open
i
have
left
my
students
for
a
week
i
can
t
leave
them
for
another
week
said
the
english
teacher
who
travelled
from
the
eastern
city
of
yola
weighing
up
the
expense
and
disruption
in
returning
to
the
city
in
which
he
registered
to
vote
many
of
the
country
s
million
eligible
voters
having
spent
considerable
sums
of
money
on
travel
face
the
same
dilemma
the
delay
to
the
election
now
scheduled
for
saturday
could
depress
turnout
according
to
politicians
and
civil
society
groups
that
in
turn
would
reduce
the
mandate
of
the
eventual
winner
to
rule
africa
s
most
populous
country
and
its
biggest
economy
the
two
main
candidates
president
muhammadu
buhari
and
former
vice
president
atiku
abubakar
are
also
both
over
years
old
and
have
failed
to
generate
significant
excitement
from
a
relatively
youthful
population
it
disadvantages
us
because
we
need
the
turnout
our
base
is
the
youth
population
and
they
re
the
ones
who
can
just
easily
get
turned
off
from
the
whole
process
bukola
saraki
director
general
of
atiku
s
campaign
told
reuters
in
an
interview
the
momentum
was
on
our
side
he
said
idayat
hassan
director
of
the
think
tank
centre
for
democracy
and
development
also
said
the
delay
would
likely
benefit
buhari
his
supporters
had
been
galvanised
in
the
last
two
elections
with
a
high
turnout
in
his
core
base
in
the
northwest
she
said
the
region
with
the
highest
number
of
registered
voters
the
main
opposition
people
s
democratic
party
pdp
typically
attracts
more
support
in
the
southeast
a
region
where
turnout
has
historically
been
low
she
said
yusuf
tuggar
a
campaign
team
member
of
the
ruling
all
progressives
congress
said
his
party
would
be
hit
harder
because
many
of
its
northern
supporters
live
in
the
south
and
could
not
afford
to
travel
home
it
hurts
us
more
because
we
have
more
supporters
he
said
turnout
in
presidential
elections
has
declined
steadily
since
from
nearly
percent
to
just
percent
in
that
is
largely
because
of
growing
disenchantment
with
a
political
class
seen
as
corrupt
and
out
of
touch
with
a
population
that
includes
a
high
proportion
of
people
living
in
extreme
poverty
hassan
said
that
irrespective
of
the
outcome
lower
voter
numbers
would
be
dangerous
for
the
winner
sooner
or
later
many
people
will
question
the
legitimacy
of
elected
representatives
especially
when
they
have
not
participated
in
the
process
said
hassan
such
concerns
have
led
to
the
announcement
of
measures
aimed
at
boosting
turnout
the
interior
ministry
said
friday
would
be
a
public
holiday
to
give
people
time
to
travel
to
the
polls
while
fuel
suppliers
cut
the
price
of
petrol
and
a
trade
union
that
operates
bus
routes
nationwide
agreed
to
provide
discounts
for
trips
to
voting
points
the
hope
was
that
people
would
overcome
the
difficulties
involved
in
making
a
second
trek
to
the
polls
i
need
to
travel
to
perform
my
citizenship
of
nigeria
said
student
francisca
esidoy
as
she
boarded
a
bus
in
the
northern
city
of
kano
where
she
lives
to
make
the
kilometre
miles
journey
to
her
southeastern
home
state
of
abia
but
others
could
not
be
enticed
brauna
afraimu
a
civil
servant
based
in
yola
said
he
was
too
disillusioned
to
make
the
kilometre
journey
to
nearby
bauchi
state
all
these
things
will
not
motivate
me
to
go
and
vote
i
ve
already
spent
a
lot
of
my
resources
and
time
last
week
