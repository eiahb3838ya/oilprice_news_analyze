iran
has
remained
within
the
key
limits
on
its
nuclear
activities
imposed
by
its
deal
with
major
powers
despite
growing
pressure
from
newly
reimposed
sanctions
a
report
by
the
nuclear
watchdog
showed
on
friday
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
is
policing
the
deal
which
lifted
sanctions
against
tehran
in
exchange
for
restrictions
on
tehran
s
atomic
activities
aimed
at
increasing
the
time
iran
would
need
to
make
an
atom
bomb
if
it
chose
to
iran
has
stayed
within
caps
on
the
level
to
which
it
can
enrich
uranium
as
well
as
its
stock
of
enriched
uranium
the
iaea
said
in
a
confidential
quarterly
report
sent
to
its
member
states
and
obtained
by
reuters
not
much
has
changed
a
continuing
reporting
of
the
implementation
by
iran
a
senior
diplomat
said
on
condition
of
anonymity
summarising
the
report
the
iaea
also
repeated
its
usual
statement
that
it
carried
out
complementary
access
inspections
which
are
often
at
short
notice
at
all
locations
in
iran
that
it
needed
to
visit
president
donald
trump
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
last
may
reimposing
sanctions
on
iran
s
economy
and
lifeblood
oil
industry
that
were
lifted
under
the
agreement
european
powers
that
signed
the
deal
france
britain
and
germany
have
sought
to
cushion
the
blow
to
iran
of
those
sanctions
they
are
setting
up
a
new
channel
for
trade
with
iran
but
diplomats
say
it
will
not
be
able
to
handle
the
big
transactions
iran
says
it
needs
to
keep
the
deal
afloat
setting
up
that
channel
however
has
angered
washington
for
undermining
its
effort
to
choke
iran
s
economy
in
response
to
tehran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
and
its
influence
on
the
wars
in
syria
and
yemen
vice
president
mike
pence
last
week
called
on
those
european
powers
to
follow
washington
in
pulling
out
of
the
agreement
despite
their
position
that
the
deal
is
worth
keeping
as
long
as
iran
sticks
to
it
the
islamic
republic
has
long
said
that
it
wants
nuclear
power
only
for
purposes
of
civilian
energy
iran
s
stock
of
heavy
water
a
substance
used
as
a
moderator
in
some
nuclear
reactors
stayed
within
the
limit
set
by
the
deal
and
tehran
continued
to
ship
some
of
it
out
of
the
country
with
tonne
having
been
exported
during
the
quarter
the
senior
official
said
it
was
sold
to
an
unspecified
iaea
