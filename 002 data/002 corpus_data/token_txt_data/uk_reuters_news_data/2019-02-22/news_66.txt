simon
birmingham
said
on

delays
to

caused
by
import

and
not
a
blanket
ban
on
australian
coal
the

earner
since
the
start
of

birmingham
however
denied
australia
has
been
unduly
treated
we
have
no
basis
to
believe
that
there
is
a
ban
on
australian
coal
exports
into
china
or
into
any
part
of
china
birmingham
told
reporters
adelaide
the
application
of
those
quotas
combined
with
different
testing
and
the
quality

testing
centres

be
slowing
down
