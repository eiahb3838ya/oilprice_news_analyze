the
government
pumped
up
the
economy
in
by
taxing
less
spending
more
especially
on
defence
and
boosting
borrowing
but
it
probably
can
not
repeat
the
same
stimulus
in
as
the
fiscal
stimulus
from
last
year
fades
economic
growth
is
set
to
slow
especially
in
the
manufacturing
sector
which
has
been
a
major
beneficiary
from
higher
defence
spending
the
federal
government
s
receipts
from
taxes
social
security
contributions
customs
duties
and
other
items
fell
by
percent
in
as
reduced
tax
rates
more
than
offset
the
impact
of
an
expanding
economy
federal
revenues
have
recently
been
growing
at
some
of
the
slowest
rates
outside
recession
periods
in
the
last
four
decades
monthly

statement
bureau
of
the
fiscal
service
at
the
same
time
government
spending
has
continued
rising
at
a
rate
close
to
its
average
with
federal
outlays
increasing
by
more
than
percent
last
year
compared
with
the
result
has
been
a
massive
fiscal
stimulus
in
an
economy
already
well
advanced
in
the
business
cycle
with
unemployment
at
lows
and
limited
spare
capacity
much
of
the
extra
spending
has
been
directed
towards
the
department
of
defense
where
outlays
jumped
by
almost
percent
in
the
fiscal
year
to
september
chartbook
within
the
military
budget
a
big
part
of
the
extra
spending
has
gone
on
equipment
with
procurement
surging
by
percent
in
fiscal
up
from
a
percent
increase
in
fiscal
and
percent
in
fiscal
much
of
the
extra
spending
has
been
directed
towards
hardware
rather
than
items
giving
a
massive
boost
to
the
defence
industrial
base
manufacturers
reported
that
new
orders
for
defence
capital
goods
grew
at
an
annual
rate
over
percent
in
separate
data
published
by
the
census
bureau
showed
new
orders
for
defence
capital
goods
rose
four
times
faster
percent
than
new
orders
for
capital
goods
percent
last
year
according
to
the
census
bureau
the
question
is
whether
this
rate
of
fiscal
expansion
is
sustainable
and
if
not
what
will
happen
when
the
military
spending
boom
slows
the
government
recorded
a
deficit
of
billion
in
fiscal
percent
of
gdp
according
to
the
congressional
budget
office
budget
and

cbo
january
on
current
policies
the
deficit
is
already
projected
to
increase
to
billion
in
fiscal
percent
and
trillion
by
fiscal
percent
the
scope
for
boosting
the
economy
further
by
cutting
taxes
or
increasing
spending
may
therefore
be
more
limited
in
future
higher
government
spending
and
lower
tax
payments
made
a
major
contribution
to
the
rise
in
manufacturing
activity
last

but
the
boost
may
not
be
repeatable
