portugal plans solar power licensing auction by mid-year
lisbon
feb
reuters
portugal
will
launch
its
first
big
auction
of
solar
power
capacity
in
june
or
july
offering
megawatts
as
it
seeks
to
boost
electricity
production
environment
and
energy
transition
minister
joao
matos
fernandes
told
reuters
the
new
capacity
to
be
offered
to
investors
who
have
already
shown
strong
interest
in
such
an
auction
is
more
than
times
the
installed
solar
power
capacity
in
portugal
as
of
the
end
of
last
year
and
is
part
of
a
plan
to
reach
between
mw
to
mw
by
the
minister
said
it
is
scientifically
proven
that
south
algarve
and
north
alentejo
are
the
areas
with
the
biggest
potential
for
solar
energy
in
europe
the
only
comparable
area
being
in
central
turkey
he
said
referring
to
portugal
s
two
southern
regions
so
we
will
deliberately
bet
on
promoting
solar
power
generation
projects
he
said
the
terms
of
the
auction
will
be
known
in
march
or
april
he
said
adding
that
the
government
wanted
to
take
into
account
the
opinions
of
many
foreign
investors
who
are
very
interested
in
taking
part
he
expects
the
new
capacity
to
be
added
over
the
next
two
or
three
years
in
a
sharp
acceleration
from
the
pace
seen
over
the
past
couple
of
years
when
licences
for
mw
were
attributed
but
only
mw
have
been
installed
the
recent
requirement
for
producers
to
sell
the
energy
at
market
prices
and
not
a
fixed
guaranteed
rate
as
before
has
been
one
of
the
key
obstacles
to
new
additions
as
it
constrained
small
producers
access
to
financing
the
auction
will
be
designed
to
allow
small
producers
to
fix
a
guaranteed
price
while
bigger
players
with
good
access
to
financing
will
likely
prefer
to
use
market
electricity
prices
matos
fernandes
said
he
said
there
were
players
interested
in
installing
projects
as
big
as
mw
so
far
portugal
s
largest
solar
project
has
been
the
mw
solara
also
one
of
europe
s
biggest
which
was
bought
by
allianz
capital
partners
in
december
the
mw
already
licensed
do
not
need
to
go
to
the
auction
but
licensees
will
be
able
to
sign
up
for
the
guaranteed
price
to
be
set
there
the
minister
said
the
government
expects
market
prices
to
be
higher
than
those
to
be
set
in
the
auction
and
is
planning
to
require
that
large
producers
contribute
a
share
of
their
gains
above
the
fixed
price
to
the
national
grid
