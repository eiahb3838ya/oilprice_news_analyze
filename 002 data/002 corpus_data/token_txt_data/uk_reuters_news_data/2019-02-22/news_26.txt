reuters
finland
s
nuclear
regulator
has
identified
a
safety
issue
at
olkiluoto
a
reactor
built
by
france
s
orano
and
the
problem
needs
to
be
fixed
before
the
unit
can
receive
a
permit
to
operate
the
regulator
told
reuters
the
reactor
is
due
to
start
producing
electricity
in
january
next
year
after
a
delay
part
of
the
pressuriser
a
primary
circuit
component
of
the
reactor
is
vibrating
at
levels
that
exceed
safety
limits
said
pekka
valikangas
the
regulator
s
section
head
for
nuclear
reactor
regulation
the
test
results
show
that
these
vibrations
are
not
approved
valikangas
said
in
an
interview
the
safety
assessment
by
stuk
finland
s
radiation
and
nuclear
safety
authority
is
a
key
report
that
will
influence
the
government
s
decision
on
whether
to
grant
olkiluoto
an
operation
permit
this
must
be
taken
care
of
before
the
ministry
decides
on
the
permit
valikangas
said
adding
that
the
regulator
would
offer
two
options
for
a
solution
the
reactor
s
owner
finnish
consortium
tvo
and
supplier
orano
previously
known
as
areva
would
need
to
choose
from
those
options
stuk
will
present
the
details
of
its
assessment
on
monday
when
it
is
also
expected
to
publish
its
recommendation
to
the
ministry
of
economic
affairs
and
employment
which
decides
energy
policy
and
will
rule
on
the
reactor
s
permit
valikangas
said
he
could
not
tell
whether
the
development
would
lead
to
further
delays
adding
it
was
up
to
areva
and
tvo
to
fix
the
problem
on
time
i
do
not
know
if
it
will
delay
the
reactor
there
is
still
time
in
the
testing
programme
to
fix
it
he
said
the
part
of
the
pressuriser
that
needs
fixing
is
the
pipeline
which
is
related
to
the
reactor
s
cooling
system
and
was
supplied
by
areva
valikangas
said
he
did
not
elaborate
on
the
two
solutions
stuk
had
identified
and
said
further
details
would
be
made
public
on
monday
there
was
no
suggestion
that
the
problem
identified
at
olkiluoto
would
affect
other
reactors
the
facility
in
western
finland
already
more
than
a
decade
behind
schedule
has
sustained
several
delays
the
latest
announced
last
november
entitled
the
finnish
operator
to
a
payment
of
million
euros
million
from
areva
before
that
in
march
areva
settled
a
dispute
with
tvo
by
agreeing
to
pay
million
euros
for
cost
overruns
and
delays
it
also
agreed
to
pay
a
further
million
euros
for
each
additional
month
of
delays
from
tvo
said
it
had
identified
the
problem
and
been
working
with
orano
on
a
fix
which
it
expected
to
have
in
place
during
spring
we
have
been
testing
different
options
we
have
a
solution
for
that
there
are
two
support
system
options
and
we
have
picked
the
right
one
we
need
to
show
stuk
that
it
works
a
tvo
spokesman
said
he
could
not
say
whether
that
would
secure
the
permit
tvo
needs
and
added
that
olkiluoto
could
not
start
loading
fuel
before
receiving
that
approval
orano
was
not
immediately
available
for
comment
finland
needs
the
reactor
as
it
imports
more
than
percent
of
its
electricity
from
neighbouring
sweden
and
russia
while
its

needs
are
growing
