the
cacophony
of
sirens
horns
and
street
vendors
in
haiti
s
capital
was
quieter
than
usual
this
week
as
residents
remained
on
edge
after
recent
protests
which
organizers
have
promised
will
start
again
on
friday
thousands
of
demonstrators
took
to
the
streets
of
and
the
island
nation
s
other
main
cities
for
days
of
protests
that
began
on
calling
for
president
jovenel
moise
to
resign
amid
ballooning
inflation
a
weakening
currency
and
allegations
of
misused
funds
the
protests
hurt
my
business
we
re
frustrated
and
the
people
are
still
scared
said
old
jocelyn
alexis
a
street
vendor
in
the
city
center
other
small
business
owners
said
that
customers
were
still
staying
away
after
the
recent
protests
turned
violent
even
though
the
marches
died
down
this
week
opposition
leaders
are
calling
for
an
independent
probe
into
the
whereabouts
of
funds
from
the
petrocaribe
agreement
an
alliance
between
caribbean
countries
including
haiti
and
venezuela
the
agreement
s
preferential
terms
for
energy
purchases
were
meant
to
help
free
up
funds
to
aid
development
in
haiti
a
poor
country
habitually
hammered
by
natural
disasters
the
fight
will
continue
we
will
continue
to
seek
the
president
s
resignation
and
we
need
to
have
a
petrocaribe
probe
because
we
need
to
end
the
corruption
in
this
country
that
has
allowed
a
small
minority
to
get
majority
of
wealth
said
opposition
leader
andre
michel
the
new
protests
are
set
for
friday
he
said
the
fight
will
start
in
an
address
from
the
presidential
palace
on
moise
struck
a
combative
note
and
defied
calls
for
his
ouster
saying
he
would
not
hand
the
country
over
to
drug
traffickers
and
that
dialogue
was
the
only
way
to
stop
a
civil
war
haiti
has
a
long
tradition
of
corruption
and
international
partners
and
watchdogs
have
often
blamed
haitian
politicians
for
failing
to
crack
down
on
the
scourge
the
government
s
mismanagement
of
the
economy
has
also
fueled
haitians
frustrations
said
economist
kesner
pharel
at
consultancy
group
croissance
annual
inflation
of
percent
as
of
december
and
a
currency
that
weakened
nearly
percent
versus
the
dollar
last
year
and
continued
to
depreciate
in
has
made
buying
basic
necessities
more
difficult
in
the
western
hemisphere
s
poorest
nation
people
are
living
in
misery
we
won
t
stop
until
we
get
what
we
need
we
need
better
leaders
in
government
that
give
people
hope
until
then
the
battle
will
continue
