analysis-asia's surging fuel exports depress refining industry profits
singapore

asia
s
biggest
oil
consumers
are
flooding
the
region
with
fuel
as
refining
output
is
exceeding
consumption
amid
a
slowdown
in

growth
pressuring
industry
profits
since
the

been
the

s

oil
consuming
region
led
by
traditional
industrial
users
south
korea
and
japan
along
with
rising
economic
powerhouses
china
and
india
yet
overbuilding
of
refineries
and
currently
sluggish
demand
growth
have
caused
a
jump
in
fuel
exports
from
these

hubs
car
sales
in
china
the
world
s

fell
for
the
first
time
on

last
year
and
early

also
remain
weak

a
slowdown
in

china
national

corp
in

said
it
expected
demand
to
fall
by
percent
in
that
would
be
china
s
first
annual

decline
for
a
major
fuel
since
its
industrial
ascent
started
in
the
surge
in

combined

in

combine
the
slumping
margins
with
labour
costs
and
taxes
and
many
asian
refineries
now
struggle
to

the

have
pummelled

jeff

the

said
the
surge
in
exports
and
resulting
oversupply
were
a
big
problem
for
the
industry
the
pressure
on

margins
is
a
case
of
death
by

throughout

refinitiv
shipping
data

fuel
exports
from
those

have
risen
since
to
a
record
of
around
million

in

the
biggest
jump
in
exports
has
come
from
china
where
refiners
are
selling
off
record
amounts
of
excess
fuel
into
asia
there
is
a
risk
for
asian
market
turmoil
if
china

fuel
export
capacity
remains
at
the
current
level
or
grows
further
said
noriaki
sakai
chief
executive
officer
at
idemitsu
kosan
during
a
news
conference
last
week
but
japan
s
and
south
korea
s
fuel
exports
have
also
risen
as
demand
at
home
falls
amid
mature
industry
and
a
shrinking
population
japan
s
oil
demand
will
drop
by
percent
from
while
south
korea
s
will
remain
flat
according
to
forecasts
from
energy
aspects
in
japan
oil
imports
have
been
falling
steadily
for
years
yet
its
refiners
produce
more
fuel
than
its
industry
can
absorb
the
situation
is
similar
in
south
korea
the

refiner
by
capacity
according
to
data
from
bp
plc
cho
an
official
at
the
korea
petroleum
association
which
represents
south
korean
refiners
said
the
surging
exports
had
triggered
a
gasoline
glut
that
glut
caused
negative
gasoline
margins
in
january
compounding
the
supply
overhang
in

fuel
exports
from

doubled
since
to
around

according
to

estimates
even

set

malaysia
s
petroliam
nasional
bhd
is
starting
up
its
rapid
refinery
capable
of
processing

while
china
and
india
also
have
several
projects
coming
online
this
year
and
next

is
expected
to
lead
the

said
the

adding
that
this
would
increase

exports
from

despite
so
many
refineries
coming
to
the

the
outlook
is
not

bleak

said
new

by
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
that
will
require
shippers
to
reduce

the
main
relief
