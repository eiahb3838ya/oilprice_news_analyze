little leeway to ease consumer pain as european power prices soar
reuters
households
across
europe
should
brace
for
higher
energy
bills
this
year
as
governments
have
had
little
success
in
limiting
rises
in
the
face
of
soaring
wholesale
and
environmental
costs
this
has
already
spelt
trouble
for
some
rising
energy
prices
and
plans
to
hike
fuel
taxes
were
a
catalyst
for
the
yellow
vest
protests
that
have
swept
france
since
november
prompting
the
government
to
reverse
several
tax
initiatives
other
governments
across
the
continent
have
also
felt
the
heat
of
public
frustration
over
rising
bills
but
have
struggled
to
find
a
formula
to
keep
a
lid
on
charges
britain
imposed
a
household
energy
price
cap
in
january
but
the
regulator
has
allowed
a
percent
price
hike
from
april
poland
has
to
amend
its
plans
for
a
cap
to
ensure
they
do
not
violate
european
union
rules
on
state
aid
for
utilities
failure
to
address
the
issue
could
help
fuel
popular
anger
and
protest
votes
in
european
union
parliamentary
elections
in
may
or
looming
national
polls
including
poland
s
elections
there
is
a
risk
of
protests
like
the
yellow
vests
spreading
so
long
as
people
feel
that
they
are
excluded
from
discussions
around
energy
issues
reserved
for
technocrats
said
francois
gemenne
at
sciencespo
university
in
paris
adding
that
the
votes
would
highlight
questions
around
social
since
the
start
of
power
prices
have
risen

spain
and
italy

in

more

customers

edf
will

on
june
the
biggest
increase
since
in
belgium
regulator
creg
sparked
a
public
outcry
by
proposing
a
percent
rise
in
the
electricity
tariffs
that
are
paid
by
households
utilities
say
they
have
to
charge
more

wholesale

also
say
they
face
extra

from
the

cut
down

analysts
expect
the

to

said
stephen

chief
commercial
officer
of

energy
services
in
poland
the
government
adopted
legislation
in
december
designed
to
prevent
an
expected
rise
in
power
prices
for
households
and
big
consumers
at
the
start
of
ahead
of
a
general
election
in
the
autumn
the
bill
aimed
to
cap
power
prices
at
levels
at
a
cost
of
about
billion
zlotys
billion
covering
costs
of
compensating
utilities
and
for
cutting
taxes
and
fees
but
the
legislation
needs
amending
to
meet

and

minister
jadwiga
emilewicz
said
the
government
acted
after
energy
prices
rose
percent
in
but
she
said
prices
could
climb
again
in
when
a
presidential
election
is
due
the
questions
are
whether
there
will
be
more
meddling
with
retail
power
prices
or
whether
the
problem
will
be
solved
as
coal
prices
are
falling

norway
and

where
consumers
face
some
of
the
highest
electricity

have
cut

to
help
reduce
household

but
such
a
step
also
leaves
governments
with
less
to
spend
on
the
shift
to
renewables
the
german
government
has
hinted
it
could
look
at
cutting
its
on
electricity
that
helps
fund
development
of
renewables
and
could
consider
reducing
network
transmission
fees
but
it
faces
a
juggling
act
as
it
seeks
to
keep

down
while
paying

germany
