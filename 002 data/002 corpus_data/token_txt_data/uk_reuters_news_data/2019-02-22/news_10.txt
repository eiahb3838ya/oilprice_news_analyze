winnipeg

canada
s
national
energy
board
neb
regulator
recommended
on
friday
that
ottawa
approve
expansion
of
the
trans
mountain
oil
pipeline
but
made
new
nonbinding
recommendations
to
mitigate
harm
to
pacific
ocean
killer
whales
the
pipeline
is
in
the
national
interest
as
it
will
create
jobs
and
allow
canadian
oil
to
reach
more
markets
the
neb
said
in
a
report
but
expanding
it
is
likely
to
significantly
harm
the
killer
whale
population
off
the
coast
of
british
columbia
and
increase
greenhouse
gas
emissions
from
ships
the
board
said
in
its
report
a
spill
while
unlikely
would
also
be
damaging
it
said
the
neb
made
new
recommendations
ranging
from
offsetting
increased
underwater
noise
to
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
from
ships
the
recommendations
constitute
nonbinding
advice
to
the
government
ottawa
in
september
directed
the
board
to
conduct
a
new
review
of
its
application
to
nearly
triple
the
capacity
of
trans
mountain
which
the
government
bought
for
c
billion
billion
last
year
from
kinder
morgan
canada
to
ensure
it
gets
built
the
move
came
after
canada
s
federal
court
of
appeal
overturned
the
liberal
government
s
approval
to
expand
the
pipeline
which
runs
from
alberta
to
the
british
columbia
coast
the
court
ruled
that
the
neb
failed
to
consider
marine
impacts
and
that
the
government
did
not
adequately
consult
indigenous
groups
the
neb
s
ruling
is
a
political
win
albeit
with
mixed
implications
for
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
ahead
of
a
fall
election
he
faces
both
anger
from
western
canadians
over
the
oil
industry
s
struggles
and
pressure
from
environmentally
minded
voters
who
do
not
want
pipelines
built
canada
s
oil
production
has
expanded
faster
than
pipeline
capacity
causing
a
glut
last
year
that
depressed
prices
the
neb
s
reaffirmation
that
the
project
is
of
national
interest
was
essential
said
tim
mcmillan
president
of
the
canadian
association
of
petroleum
producers
pending
government
legislation
will
make
regulatory
approval
of
future
pipelines
more
difficult
making
it
more
important
that
the
ones
already
in
the
queue
get
built
he
said
given
recurring
delays
companies
that
drill
wells
remain
doubtful
trans
mountain
will
be
expanded
said
mark
scholz
chief
executive
of
the
canadian
association
of
oilwell
drilling
contractors
calling
canada
the
black
hole
of
the
neb
s
report
now
goes
to
trudeau
and
his
cabinet
which
by
law
has
days
to
respond
consultation
with
indigenous
groups
is
well
under
way
and
the
government
is
in
a
strong
position
to
decide
within
that
time
frame
but
has
made
no
decision
natural
resources
minister
amarjeet
sohi
said
in
an
interview
sohi
said
the
neb
s
recommendations
broadly
align
with
his
government
s
values
but
that
it
needs
more
time
to
study
them
the
southern
resident
killer
whale
population
is
already
endangered
and
even
the
pipeline
s
relatively
minor
impacts
would
cause
additional
harm
including
from
potential
strikes
by
ships
the
board
s
chief
environment
officer
robert
steedman
said
the
board
s
decision
is
unsurprising
given
that
the
neb
limited
its
review
to
nautical
miles
of
the
whales
habitat
and
refused
to
consider
the
impact
on
areas
said
eugene
kung
lawyer
at
west
coast
environmental
law
the
fix
was
in
from
the
start
he
said
this
project
amounts
to
a
death
sentence
for
the
south
resident
the
neb
failed
to
produce
evidence
that
the
pipeline
s
expansion
will
benefit
the
economy
said
elizabeth
may
leader
of
canada
s
green
party
the
board
also
imposed
binding
conditions
including
issues
of
emergency
preparedness
and
consultation
with
indigenous
communities
