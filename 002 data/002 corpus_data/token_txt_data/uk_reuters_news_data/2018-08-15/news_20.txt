sat
in
a
blue
plastic
chair
under
a
mango
tree
next
to
three
of
his
four
wives
one
breastfeeding
a
baby
contemplating
the
imminent
loss
of
his
farm
to
an
oil

the

is
set
to
take
about
half
of
the
land

children
and
numerous
grandchildren
to
build
the
world
s
longest
electrically
heated
oil
pipeline
from

uganda
to
tanzania
s
tanga
port
on

i
am

i
don
t

is
taken
mubona
told

from
kyakatemba
village
in
hoima
district
a
poor
region
along
uganda
s
western
border
with
the
democratic
republic
of
congo
when
the
pipeline
takes
a
bigger
portion
of
your
land
and
you
remain
with
a
small
portion
what
do
you
do
with
that
small
portion
uganda
discovered
crude
reserves
estimated
by
government
geologists
at
billion
barrels
in
the
albertine
rift
basin
more
than
years
ago
the
east
african
country
aims
to
refine
crude
oil
domestically
and
export
some
via
a
pipeline
through
neighbouring
tanzania
by
an
energy
ministry
official
told
mubona
that
a
chunk
of
his
land
will
be
used
to
run
a
wide
pipeline
road
and
power
line
from
the
refinery
to
the
sea
uganda
signed
an
agreement
in
april
with
a
consortium
including
a
subsidiary
of
general
electric
to
build
and
operate
a
refinery
that
will
cost
up
to
billion
the
president
s
office
said
yusuf
masaba
a
spokesman
for
uganda
s
energy
ministry
said
the
entire
pipeline
route
had
been
mapped
out
and
plans
to
compensate
and
resettle
people
were
at
an
advanced
stage
once
the
government
valuer
is
done
with
valuation
then
compensation
will
be
done
i
can
not
say
when
they
will
be
compensated
masaba
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
we
are
not
going
to
break
people
s
homes
to
pass
the
line
there
are
no
settlements
in
the
areas
that
the
pipeline
is
going
to
pass
he
said
emphasising
that
the
government
is
only
going
to
acquire
farmland
not
houses
mubona
will
not
be
the
first
ugandan
to
lose
land
to
the
oil
project
which
the
government
hopes
will
spur
economic
growth
pay
down
the
national
debt
and
reduce
poverty
more
than
people
were
evicted
from
neighbouring
villages
in
hoima
district
in
for
the
refinery
and
a
new
international
airport
which
will
fly
in
oil
equipment
according
to
the
energy
ministry
in
kyakaboga
resettlement
village
some
km
west
of
mubona
s
family
about
concrete
houses
with
red
iron
roofs
stood
in
neat
lines
more
than
a
dozen
lay
empty
the
houses
were
built
for
families
that
lost
their
land
and
homes
to
the
refinery
and
opted
to
be
compensated
with
an
equivalent
amount
of
land
rather
than
cash
i
can
t
live
here
said
christop
opio
one
of
the
small
minority
who
chose
resettlement
over
money
when
the
government
acquired
his
land
in
kabaale
for
the
airport
it
looks
like
a
camp
and
there
is
no
privacy
all
houses
are
so
close
together
he
said
gesturing
at
the
two
rows
of
houses
as
construction
workers
in
orange
and
red
reflector
jackets
laid
stones
to
build
a
police
station
in
the
midday
sun
many
families
who
have
been
resettled
on
the
plot
complained
that
they
could
not
keep
livestock
at
the
modern
houses
unlike
at
their
old
rural
homes
and
that
their
new
farmland
was
too
far
away
he
said
the
families
who
chose
cash
compensation
have
not
fared
much
better
activists
said
innocent
tumwebaze
chairman
of
the
oil
refinery
residents
association
which
represents
evictees
said
the
million
shillings
per
acre
compensation
was
too
little
to
buy
land
in
the
same
area
we
were
compensated
using
outdated
rates
he
said
standing
outside
his
house
in
kyakaboga
resettlement
village
masaba
said
land
is
valued
according
to
the
market
price
in
the
area
and
that
people
who
choose
to
receive
cash
compensation
agree
to
the
rate
before
accepting
the
money
there
is
no
one
who
is
forced
to
take
compensation
they
don
t
agree
to
we
have
a
grievance
mechanism
and
they
can
also
go
to
court
he
said
by
phone
some
men
who
received
the
cash
as
the
customary
landowners
deserted
their
families
and
disappeared
to
towns
abandoning
their
wives
and
children
who
are
staying
with
relatives
issues
of
compensation
have
broken
up
many
families
tumwebaze
said
back
in
mubona
s
village
red
crosses
painted
by
government
officials
in
april
mark
the
doors
of
five
houses
i
was
told
that
an
oil
pipeline
is
going
to
pass
through
here
said
jacinta
kyomukama
whose
house
is
marked
adding
that
she
is
unsure
whether
to
plant
for
the
next
season
in
case
she
is
moved
masaba
said
the
marks
did
not
mean
those
houses
would
be
demolished
as
the
pipeline
s
final
route
has
not
been
decided
i
expect
to
be
compensated
and
then
go
and
buy
land
elsewhere
said
the
mother
of
seven
as
her
grandchildren
milled
around
her
i
do
intend
to
go
very
far
from
here
