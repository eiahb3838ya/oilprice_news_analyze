cyclical
indicators
point
to
slower
and
more
uneven
growth
in
the
global
economy
for
the
rest
of
this
year
and
into
which
means
the
rise
in
oil
consumption
is
likely
to
moderate
especially
for
distillates
like
diesel
economic
growth
remains
strong
in
the
united
states
but
in
much
of
the
rest
of
the
world
clear
signs
of
slackening
momentum
have
emerged
since
the
start
of
the
year
strong
and
synchronised
global
growth
in
has
given
way
to
a
weaker
and
more
varied
picture
in
and
which
is
likely
to
be
less
supportive
for
oil
consumption
and
prices
the
oecd
s
composite
leading
indicator
which
covers
the
advanced
economies
plus
china
india
russia
brazil
indonesia
and
south
africa
peaked
in
january
but
has
since
fallen
and
slipped
below
trend
in
may
and
june
world
trade
volume
growth
also
peaked
in
january
at
almost
percent
but
had
nearly
halved
to
less
than
percent
by
may
according
to
the
netherlands
bureau
for
economic
policy
analysis
the
new
export
orders
component
of
jpmorgan
s
global
purchasing
managers
index
peaked
in
january
showing
the
fastest
increase
for
seven
years
but
has
since
fallen
every
month
and
showed
only
marginal
growth
in
july
south
korea
s
share
index
a
useful
proxy
for
global
trade
growth
given
the
country
s
heavy
export
orientation
peaked
in
january
but
has
since
fallen
and
hit
a
low
this
week
air
freight
volumes
are
still
growing
but
more
slowly
than
in
reflecting
the
completion
of
the
restocking
cycle
and
a
slowdown
in
manufacturing
orders
according
to
the
international
air
transport
association
these
indicators
are
all
correlated
closely
with
one
another
and
with
the
rate
of
expansion
in
the
world
economy
and
they
all
tell
a
consistent
story
of
slowing
momentum
outside
the
united
states
the
softening
outlook
for
world
trade
has
filtered
through
to
the
oil
market
with
brent
calendar
spreads
and
spot
prices
peaking
in
april
and
may
respectively
refined
fuels
including
road
diesel
marine
gasoil
and
jet
kerosene
are
the
most
heavily
geared
to
the
growth
of
freight
given
their
dominance
in
the
road
rail
shipping
and
air
cargo
sectors
if
global
trade
growth
slows
consumption
of
will
also
decelerate
though
the
outlook
for
these
fuels
is
complicated
by
the
introduction
of
new
marine
fuel
regulations
at
the
start
of
so
far
the
main
cyclical
indicators
point
to
a
slackening
of
growth
momentum
rather
than
a
more
pronounced
slowdown
in
the
world
economy
none
of
the
major
economic
forecasters
is
predicting
a
recession
later
in
or
however
the
number
of
risk
factors
in
the
global
economy
is
multiplying
and
includes
rising
interest
rates
rising
value
of
the
dollar
rising
emerging
market
debt
rising
corporate
leverage
deteriorating
credit
quality
high
oil
prices
especially
in
economies
rising
tariffs
and
trade
disputes
increasing
diplomatic
uncertainty
cocktails
of
some
or
all
of
these
risk
factors
have
preceded
most
recent
international
economic
crises
in
the
last
four
decades
including
the
latin
american
debt
default
mexico
s
debt
default
and
the
tequila
crisis
thailand
s
devaluation
and
the
southeast
asian
financial
crisis
and
russia
s
financial
crisis
compounding
the
uncertainty
the
outlook
for
fiscal
monetary
and
trade
policies
has
become
confused
with
the
world
s
largest
economies
all
trying
to
pursue
inconsistent
policies
on
tariffs
and
currency
valuations
the
united
states
is
pursuing
an
expansionary
fiscal
policy
combined
with
a
restrictive
monetary
policy
causing
the
real
exchange
rate
to
appreciate
while
simultaneously
trying
to
reduce
the
external
trade
deficit
with
tariffs
fiscal
policy
has
turned
strongly
even
though
the
expansion
is
over
nine
years
old
unemployment
is
at
lows
and
inflation
has
accelerated
to
the
fastest
rate
for
more
than
six
years
china
has
eased
monetary
policy
and
allowed
its
currency
to
depreciate
since
the
start
of
the
year
to
offset
the
impact
of
higher
tariffs
and
counter
a
slowdown
in
its
domestic
economy
the
currencies
of
the
euro
zone
and
the
united
kingdom
have
also
weakened
supporting
flagging
domestic
growth
but
now
creating
problems
with
rising
imported
inflation
there
is
a
significant
possibility
that
global
growth
will
experience
either
a
mild
or
a
deeper
slowdown
over
the
next
months
it
is
of
course
possible
the
current
loss
of
momentum
will
turn
out
to
be
no
more
than
a
temporary
soft
patch
with
growth
accelerating
again
on
balance
however
the
main
leading
indicators
suggest
the
pace
of
economic
expansion
and
the
outlook
for
growth
in
oil
consumption
will
continue
slowing
for
at
least
the
next
six
months
