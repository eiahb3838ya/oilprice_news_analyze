european
union
carbon
permit
prices
have
risen
to
their
highest
in
years
as
reduced
supply
has
prompted
a
flurry
of
buying
the
permits
called
eu
allowances
are
traded
under
the
european
union
s
emissions
trading
system
ets
which
charges
power
plants
and
factories
for
every
tonne
of
carbon
dioxide
they
emit
higher
carbon
prices
make
it
more
expensive
for
european
utilities
to
burn
fossil
fuels
and
encourage
a
shift
to
cleaner
sources
of
energy
the
ets
the
eu
s
flagship
tool
for
reducing
emissions
has
suffered
from
excess
supply
since
the
financial
crisis
which
dragged
prices
down
to
lows
of
euros
a
tonne
eu
allowances
for
delivery
in
december
hit
an
high
of
euros
a
tonne
in
early
trade
on
wednesday
their
highest
level
since
november
the
rise
had
a
effect
on
german
baseload
power
prices
which
reached
a
record
high
when
wholesale
energy
prices
rise
on
the
back
of
higher
carbon
utilities
in
some
european
countries
pass
on
some
of
the
cost
to
consumers
through
higher
retail
energy
prices
carbon
prices
are
still
under
a
record
high
of
more
than
euros
in
not
long
after
the
ets
started
by
gmt
the
eu
allowance
price
had
retreated
to
euros
a
tonne
the
ets
was
long
viewed
as
inefficient
because
it
suffered
from
too
many
permits
reforms
were
hammered
out
last
november
after
more
than
two
years
of
debate
in
brussels
the
reforms
struck
a
delicate
balance
between
being
ambitious
on
climate
change
and
protecting
industries
at
risk
of
relocating
abroad
to
avoid
climate
legislation
in
measures
to
address
the
oversupply
the
european
commission
will
withold
a
certain
number
of
permits
from
market
auctions
from
next
year
in
a
mechanism
called
the
market
stability
reserve
msr
traders
said
buying
has
increased
in
recent
weeks
as
market
participants
stock
up
to
build
long
positions
due
to
reduced
supply
from
auctions
and
amid
higher
energy
prices
the
number
of
permits
released
to
the
market
by
auctions
has
been
reduced
this
month
due
to
public
holidays
in
several
european
countries
added
to
that
weekly
german
auctions
will
stop
after
until
the
first
quarter
of
next
year
as
germany
s
current
contract
with
the
european
energy
exchange
eex
expires
nearly
million
permits
from
those
auctions
will
have
to
be
sold
when
auctions
resume
next
year
but
is
already
in
serious
deficit
due
to
the
msr
reserve
kicking
in
so
million
tonnes
of
additional
supply
in
that
year
will
make
no
difference
to
the
deficit
said
analysts
at
investment
bank
berenberg
the
bank
said
average
prices
could
rise
to
euros
a
tonne
in
and
euros
in
in
a
reuters
survey
last
month
analysts
raised
their
forecasts
for
carbon
prices
to
after
a
bullish
start
to
the
year
and
on
expectations
that
plans
to
reform
the
market
will
significantly
curb
oversupply
