chondol
remembers
a
time
when
the
water
that
flowed
through
the
town
of
leh
high
in
the
himalayas
in
india
s
far
north
was
pristine
we
used
to
drink
directly
from
the
streams
until
our
land
became
a
tourist
hub
said
chondol
wearing
a
traditional
black
gown
and
a
red
scarf
leh
is
the
largest
town
in
the
remote
region
of
ladakh
where
locals
have
long
wrested
a
living
from
herding
goats
and
tending
barley
and
wheat
fields
ringed
by
peaks
buddhist
monasteries
that
dot
the
landscape
are
a
reminder
of
ties
to
its
eastern
neighbour
tibet
but
as
members
of
india
s
burgeoning
have
ventured
in
increasing
numbers
to
holiday
in
ladakh
s
tranquil
terrain
its
resources
have
been
put
under
strain
threatening
its
fragile
ecosystem
more
than
tourists
visited
leh
last
year
alone
the
local
tourism
body
said
twice
the
number
of
residents
in
the
region
the
result
vehicles
clogging
narrow
roads
and
much
more
pollution
particularly
sewage
and
plastic
bags
with
the
arrival
of
lots
of
tourists
people
gradually
forgot
about
the
traditional
ways
of
keeping
the
surroundings
clean
chondol
said
adding
that
the
convenience
and
popularity
of
plastic
bags
had
made
matters
worse
rigzin
spalgon
who
heads
leh
s
municipal
committee
said
that
a
decade
ago
the
city
produced
almost
no
waste
all
of
a
sudden
we
started
generating
more
than
tonnes
of
waste
and
a
lot
of
sewage
per
day
spalgon
said
the
steady
environmental
deterioration
over
the
years
spurred
more
than
volunteers
in
the
women
s
alliance
of
ladakh
which
chondol
heads
to
take
measures
to
tackle
plastic
waste
this
made
us
to
think
that
we
have
to
do
something
about
it
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
world
uses
up
to
trillion
plastic
bags
annually
the
environment
programme
says
with
some
million
tons
of
plastics
ending
up
in
the
oceans
each
year
india
generates
tonnes
of
plastic
waste
daily
nearly
half
ends
up
in
landfills
on
the
streets
and
in
drains
and
sewage
systems
according
to
india
s
central
pollution
control
board
the
issue
of
plastic
pollution
has
caught
the
attention
of
india
s
government
which
in
june
pledged
to
eliminate
all
plastics
in
the
country
by
the
jammu
and
kashmir
region
where
ladakh
is
located
has
moved
faster
in
january
this
year
it
banned
plastic
bags
outright
using
a
plastic
bag
carries
a
fine
of
rupees
or
up
to
one
month
in
jail
or
both
we
were
able
to
make
ladakh
free
of
plastic
all
because
of
the
efforts
of
women
s
alliance
of
ladakh
they
initiated
the
whole
process
and
later
ensured
that
the
ban
on
plastic
bags
works
said
spalgon
half
of
india
s
states
and
union
territories
have
introduced
a
ban
on
plastic
bags
yet
many
shoppers
remain
wedded
to
them
plastic
waste
litters
the
streets
of
the
south
asian
nation
historically
we
have
had
a
very
poor
record
of
plastic
ban
implementation
with
most
governments
only
providing
lip
service
said
pratibha
sharma
from
the
campaign
group
global
alliance
for
incinerator
alternatives
megha
shenoy
a
researcher
at
the
ashoka
trust
for
research
in
ecology
and
the
environment
said
broader
action
was
needed
governments
need
to
work
with
citizens
to
collect
fines
and
companies
need
to
be
held
accountable
in
terms
of
their
environmental
and
social
responsibilities
shenoy
said
enforcing
plastic
bans
also
depends
on
people
power
said
shakil
romshoo
head
of
the
earth
sciences
department
at
kashmir
university
the
reason
why
these
bans
don
t
make
an
impact
in
india
is
very
simple
people
are
yet
to
get
involved
directly
or
indirectly
in
making
these
bans
a
success
said
romshoo
the
ban
on
plastic
in
ladakh
was
successful
because
groups
like
women
s
alliance
ensured
people
s
participation
in
implementing
the
bans
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
ladakh
alliance
volunteers
backed
by
the
local
council
and
the
police
inspect
shops
and
markets
up
to
three
times
a
year
they
also
come
armed
with
a
solution
not
only
do
they
warn
locals
about
the
damage
plastic
bags
do
in
the
environment
but
they
sell
handmade
cloth
bags
as
an
alternative
the
income
generated
from
making
and
selling
cloth
bags
as
well
as
traditional
dresses
helps
the
volunteers
continue
their
conservation
efforts
while
providing
them
with
an
extra
source
of
cash
in
a
region
where
most
women
are
farmers
and
housewives
i
want
to
be
the
part
of
the
ladakhi
women
s
movement
as
it
is
helping
ladakh
s
environment
and
agriculture
which
is
at
risk
because
of
the
huge
influx
of
tourists
and
chemical
fertilisers
said
volunteer
sonam
dolma
chondol
said
the
women
s
group
is
also
now
campaigning
to
end
the
use
of
chemical
fertilisers
its
actions
have
had
other
consequences
too
she
said
before
no
one
would
think
of
allowing
women
to
go
out
of
the
houses
by
themselves
forget
about
allowing
them
taking
a
lead
role
in
bringing
change
in
the
society
she
said
thanks
to
the
success
of
women
s
alliance
today
women
in
ladakh
are
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
