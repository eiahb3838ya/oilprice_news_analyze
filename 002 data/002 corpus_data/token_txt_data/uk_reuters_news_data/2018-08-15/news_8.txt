chinese oil importers shun u.s. crude despite tariff reversal
reuters
chinese
oil
importers
are
shying
away
from
buying
crude
as
they
fear
beijing
s
decision
to
exclude
the
commodity
from
its
tariff
list
in
a
trade
dispute
between
the
world
s
biggest
economies
may
only
be
temporary
not
a
single
tanker
has
loaded
crude
oil
from
the
united
states
bound
for
china
since
the

of
august

day
bpd
in
june
and
july
the
united
states
and
china
have
been
locked
in
a
trade
spat
over
the
last
few
months
but
crude
was
dropped
from
china
s
final
list
of
tariffs
on
billion
in
goods
announced
last
week
the
move
underscored
the
growing
importance
of
the
united
states
as
a
key
global
oil
producer
and
critical
alternative
supply
source
for
top
importer
china
however
buyers
in
china
fret
the
commodity
could
be
used
as
a
bargaining
chip
in
future
negotiations
with
washington
potentially
getting
added
to
tariff
lists
if
the
trade
conflict
takes
a
turn
for
the
worse
since
it
takes
months
to
get
crude
to
china
this
not
buying
shipments
is
a
precautionary
measure
to
avoid
any
distressed
selling
in
case
the
government
puts
tariffs
on
crude
oil
said
sushant
gupta
research
director
at
energy
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
a
source
with
a
chinese
refiner
said
the
company
was
watching
and
seeing
how
the
situation
develops
before
placing
new
orders
for
oil
he
declined
to
be
identified
as
he
was
not
authorized
to
speak
with
media
that
comes
after
the
country
s
main
oil
importer
unipec
earlier
this
month
suspended
shipments
from
the
united
states
another
petroleum
source
familiar
with
the
chinese
market
said
crude
may
have
been
left
off
the
tariff
list
to
facilitate
clearing
shipments
that
have
already
been
committed
to
the
government
probably
wants
to
impose
tariffs
when
there
is
no
more
crude
on
the
water
so
i
won
t
take
it
as
a
reversal
of
the
political
stance
on
crude
said
the

a

click

oil
china
has
been
turning
to
the
middle
east
west
africa
and
latin
america
according
to
shipping
data
and
traders
that
has
been
helped
as
a
narrow

brent
and
dubai
crude
allows
atlantic
basin
oil
to
be
profitably
shipped
to
asia
the
spread
on
wednesday
had
nearly
halved
from
a
month
ago
to
per
barrel
although
china
s
biggest
oil
suppliers
are
the
middle
east
russia
and
west
africa
the
united
states
has
become
an
important
global
supplier
since
it
opened
up
its
market
for
exports
in
beyond
the
complications
of
finding
replacements
for
american
oil
the
trade
dispute
also
poses
risks
to
economic
growth
any
further
escalation
in
the
trade
conflict
between
them
is
clearly
an
important
downside
risk
and
could
lead
to
a
further
slowdown
in
oil
demand
growth
for
leading
to
downward
pressure
on
oil
prices
