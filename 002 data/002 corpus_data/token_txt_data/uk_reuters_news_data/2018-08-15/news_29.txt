action
from
turkey
s
central
bank
pushed
the
lira
higher
for
a
second
day
on
wednesday
helping
european
stocks
and
emerging
currencies
consolidate
recent
losses
though
the
dollar
stuck
at
highs
kept
up
the
pressure
on
world
markets
the
lira
bounced
another
percent
sharply
extending
tuesday
s
gains
as
authorities
further
tightened
the
screws
on
foreigners
aiming
to
short
the
currency
the
lira
is
now
around
per
dollar
off
record
lows
beyond
however
it
started
at
and
the
rebound
follows
a
percent
drop
over
the
past
month
fear
of
crisis
and
debt
defaults
in
the
country
of
million
people
is
far
from
over
as
the
central
bank
s
failure
to
tackle
galloping
inflation
and
ankara
s
diplomatic
tiff
with
washington
keep
investors
wary
it
has
calmed
down
a
bit
the
reason
is
that
the
turkish
lira
is
appreciating
and
that
is
causing
people
to
on
fundamentals
so
the
contagion
effect
naturally
is
less
said
koon
chow
a
strategist
at
fund
manager
ubp
he
said
however
there
had
been
little
fundamental
change
to
celebrate
and
added
it
s
only
a
temporary
thing
for
turkish
markets
i
m
not
sure
volatility
is
the
turkish
worries
have
in
recent
days
driven
a
capital
exodus
from
across
emerging
markets
sending
currencies
from
the
argentine
peso
to
the
indian
rupee
to
record
lows
while
emerging
equities
have
tumbled
almost
percent
from
january
highs
there
are
also
concerns
about
china
s
slowing
economy
reinforced
by
this
week
s
data
on
investment
and
industrial
output
and
the
yuan
s
weakening
to
lows
against
the
dollar
is
also
pressuring

indonesia

the

raised

the
fourth

thinned

earlier
asian

but
new

appear
set
for
a
weaker
opening
futures
show
the
concerns
have
driven
investors
to
embrace
assets
such
as
german
and
government
bonds
the
japanese
yen
and
swiss
franc
which
are
considered
safer
german
and
yields
are
down
more
bps
this
month
the
other
beneficiary
has
been
the
dollar
already
resurgent
thanks
to
the
high
yield
it
offers
it
has
surged
to
peaks
against
a
basket
of
currencies
in
light
of
all
the
turmoil
we
ve
seen
out
of
turkey
and
the
subsequent
contagion
into
other
emerging
markets
the
dollar
is
pretty
much
establishing
itself
as
the
currency
said
bart
wakabayashi
tokyo
branch
manager
at
state
street
bank
if
you
are
going
to
park
your
money
somewhere
to
stay
away
from
the
turmoil
the
dollar
is
going
to
be
the
currency
of
the
strong
dollar
s
victims
are
of
course
emerging
currencies
many
of
them
remain
under
pressure
despite
the
lira
s
recent
bounce
but
the
greenback
s
rise
has
also
pummelled
euro
and
sterling
the
former
has
been
hit
also
by
jitters
around
euro
zone
banks
exposure
to
turkey
the
single
currency
slipped
another
percent
to
a
new
low
versus
the
dollar
and
it
also
extended
losses
against
the
swiss
franc
sterling
meanwhile
tumbled
under
for
the
first
time
since
june
having
lost
ground
for
days
in
a
row
its
longest
losing
streak
since
the
currency
is
being
undermined
by
confusion
around
what
trade
deal
it
the
british
government
will
negotiate
with
the
european
union
ahead
of
britain
s
planned
exit
next
year
from
the
bloc
however
gold
the
other
traditional
safe
haven
sank
to
lows
also
hurt
by
dollar
strength
the
dollar
will
continue
to
be
the
asset
of
preference
as
a
consequence
gold
prices
are
really
going
to
struggle
