update 1-merkel says eu should meet existing emissions aims, not set new ones
berlin

a
proliferation
of
extreme
weather
events
around
the
world
provides
ample
evidence
that
climate
change
is
a
reality
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
on
sunday
but
she
rejected
calls
for
more
ambitious
climate
protection
goals
extreme
temperatures
across
the
northern
hemisphere
this
summer
have
fuelled
concerns
that
climate
change
is
gathering
pace
leading
dozens
of
countries
to
call
for
greenhouse
gas
emissions
to
be
cut
at
a
faster
rate
than
planned
but
merkel
said
such
calls
most
recently
from
the
european
commission
s
climate
chief
miguel
arias
canete
for
swifter
cuts
to
harmful
carbon
dioxide
emissions
would
be
counterproductive
adding
that
setting
new
goals
made
little
sense
when
european
countries
were
already
struggling
to
meet
their
cuts
targets
i
m
not
particularly
happy
about
these
new
proposals
she
said
of
canete
s
call
to
increase
from
to
percent
the
scale
of
cuts
to
target
by
i
think
we
should
first
stick
to
the
goals
we
have
already
set
ourselves
i
don
t
think
permanently
setting
ourselves
new
goals
makes
any
merkel
s
government
has
already
faced
criticism
for
abandoning
emissions
targets
it
had
set
itself
for
after
concluding
they
were
unachievable
while
sticking
to
a
target
it
had
set
itself
for
a
decade
later
this
summer
s
sweltering
temperatures
across
europe
have
reignited
the
climate
debate
with
record
temperatures
across
the
continent
causing
sea
ice
to
melt
in
the
arctic
and
triggering
forest
fires
across
the
continent
one
summer
doesn
t
on
its
own
express
it
but
the
piling
up
of
extreme
weather
conditions
and
the
rising
temperatures
shows
climate
change
isn
t
just
in
africa
and
the
arctic
and
antarctic
but
here
too
