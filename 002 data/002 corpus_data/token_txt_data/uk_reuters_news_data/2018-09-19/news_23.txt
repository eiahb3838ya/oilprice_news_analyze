with
emissions
still
inching
higher
and
resulting
threats
from
extreme
weather
surging
sucking
greenhouse
gases
out
of
the
atmosphere
must
become
an
urgent
priority
backers
of
carbon
removal
efforts
say
the
math
is
quite
simple
manish
bapna
executive
vice
president
of
the
world
resources
institute
told
a
panel
discussion
on
the
fledgling
approach
this
week
if
the
world
overshoots
the
temperature
goals
set
in
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
as
looks
increasingly
likely
carbon
removal
gets
us
back
on
track
he
said
the
first
imperative
is
to
reduce
emissions
as
quickly
and
deeply
as
possible
bapna
said
but
there
is
now
a
second
imperative
to
remove
carbon
dioxide
from
the
atmosphere
at
a
large
proposals
to
suck
carbon
out
of
the
atmosphere
range
from
planting
many
more
trees
which
absorb
carbon
dioxide
to
grow
to
installing
devices
that
capture
carbon
directly
from
the
air
changing
farming
practices
to
store
more
carbon
in
soils
or
producing
energy
by
growing
trees
or
crops
burning
them
and
pumping
underground
the
carbon
released
also
could
play
a
role
scientists
say
interest
in
carbon
removal
technologies
is
growing
not
least
because
countries
from
britain
to
the
united
states
have
included
some
of
them
in
their
plans
to
curb
climate
change
they
also
feature
in
a
report
due
out
next
month
by
the
world
s
leading
climate
scientists
who
say
governments
may
have
to
find
ways
to
extract
vast
amounts
of
carbon
from
the
air
if
warming
overshoots
the
lower
paris
pact
limit
of
degrees
celsius
fahrenheit
that
overshoot
is
expected
to
happen
by
about
according
to
a
draft
copy
of
the
report
carbon
removal
is
really
about
creating
options
said
kelly
levin
a
senior
associate
at
the
world
resources
institute
if
you
fast
forward
or
years
we
want
to
keep
options
the
surging
scale
of
losses
to
extreme
weather
including
the
storms
that
smashed
into
the
eastern
united
states
and
the
philippines
this
month
means
more
people
now
believe
climate
change
needs
to
be
curbed
said
klaus
lackner
director
of
the
center
for
negative
carbon
emissions
i
believe
we
are
at
a
turning
point
where
people
are
starting
to
see
the
problem
needs
to
be
solved
said
lackner
a
proponent
of
technology
to
capture
carbon
from
the
air
right
now
the
costs
of
carbon
removal
may
be
too
high
but
as
climate
impacts
worsen
eventually
it
will
hurt
and
then
we
will
pay
whatever
it
takes
he
predicted
show
me
technologies
that
didn
t
get
six
times
cheaper
in
a
decade
when
they
were
actually
used
he
added
carbon
removal
faces
many
other
challenges
including
low
government
spending
competition
for
land
and
a
need
to
move
faster
than
finance
and
technology
may
allow
experts
admitted
for
instance
capturing
carbon
dioxide
directly
from
the
air
while
possible
also
requires
a
lot
of
energy
said
james
mulligan
a
world
resources
institute
researcher
on
carbon
removal
capturing
just
percent
of
annual
emissions
would
use
percent
of
projected
energy
production
in
he
said
farming
differently
to
store
more
carbon
in
soils
by
comparison
could
be
cheaper
and
provide
extra
benefits
boosting
harvests
water
conservation
and
wildlife
habitats
said
betsy
taylor
president
of
consulting
firm
breakthrough
strategies
and
solutions
this
pathway
is
the
most
affordable
technologically
ready
and
it
is
a
option
particularly
as
about
a
third
of
the
world
s
soils
are
now
considered
degraded
she
said
experimenting
with
carbon
removal
deserves
a
newfound
sense
of
urgency
not
least
because
more
intrusive
geoengineering
ideas
such
as
blocking
some
of
the
sun
s
rays
from
reaching
the
planet
are
coming
down
the
pike
she
said
but
getting
millions
of
farmers
and
ranchers
to
alter
how
they
work
would
require
significant
investment
and
monitoring
carbon
reductions
from
soil
use
remains
an
inexact
science
experts
admitted
most
carbon
removal
technologies
would
get
the
world
only
a
fraction
of
the
way
to
solving
its
climate
problem
they
said
and
the
prospect
of
having
the
technologies
available
might
be
seized
as
an
excuse
to
stall
action
to
cut
emissions
we
need
to
be
about
the
challenges
mulligan
said
the
key
said
levin
of
the
world
resources
institute
is
ensuring
both
emissions
cuts
and
carbon
removal
efforts
move
ahead
fast
enough
to
ward
off
the
worst
anticipated
impacts
of
climate
change
from
worsening
hunger
to
extreme
heatwaves
if
you
look
at
the
science
we
have
to
pull
out
all
the
stops
on
mitigation
and
carbon
removal
at
a
scale
that
is
completely
unprecedented
