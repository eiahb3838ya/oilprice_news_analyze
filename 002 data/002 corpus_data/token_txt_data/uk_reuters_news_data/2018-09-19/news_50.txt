china
is
not
afraid
of
extreme
measures
the
united
states
is
taking
in
their
trade
war
and
will
use
it
as
an
opportunity
to
replace
imports
promote
localisation
and

a
article
in
its
overseas
edition
on
wednesday
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
dove
deeper
into
a
trade
war
on
tuesday
after
beijing
added
billion
of
products
to
its
import
tariff
list
in
retaliation
for
president
donald
trump
s
planned
levies
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
to
deal
with
the
trade
war
what
china
really
should
do
is
to
focus
on
doing
its
own
thing
well
the
people
s
daily
said
china
is
not
worried
that
the
trade
counter
measures
will
raise
domestic
commodity
prices
by
too
much
but
will
instead
use
it
as
an
opportunity
to
replace
imports
promote
localisation
or
develop
advanced
manufacturing
it
said
the
global
times
tabloid
which
is
affiliated
to
the
people
s
daily
said
the
trade
war
was
a
chance
to
pursue
greater
global
recognition
of
its
financial
markets
and
that
it
could
open
its
market
more
to
listings
by
western
firms
the
united
states
has
so
far
imposed
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
products
to
pressure
china
to
make
sweeping
changes
to
its
trade
technology
transfer
and
industrial
subsidy
policies
the
new
tariffs
will
begin
on
and
will
increase
to
percent
by
the
end
of
beijing
has
retaliated
in
kind
but
some
analysts
and
american
businesses
are
concerned
it
could
resort
to
other
measures
such
as
pressuring
companies
operating
in
china
another
chinese
newspaper
the
china
daily
also
said
in
an
editorial
on
wednesday
the
tactics
would
prove
to
be
ineffective
china
has
always
managed
to
find
the
proper
solutions
to
put
its
economy
back
on
track
the
china
daily
said
the
trade
conflict
will
not
force
china
to
succumb
to
us
pressure
instead
given
its
economic
resilience
it
will
squarely
face
those
challenges
find
the
right
solutions
and
emerge
stronger
