the
big
question
for
investors
was
whether
the
rest
of
the
world
will
rejoin
the
united
states
in
global
synchronized
growth
or
if
ongoing
trade
tensions
and
tighter

policy
finally
slow
the
economy
said
michael
arone
chief
investment
strategist
at
state
street
global
advisors
in
boston
that
kind
of
dilemma
is
really
what
investors
face
and
trade
seems
to
be
the
wild
card
in
all
this
arone
said
investors
were
underestimating
the
boost
stocks
are
gaining
from
the
massive
fiscal
policy
package
that
far
outweighs
any
trade
penalties
that
have
been
put
forward

said
the

year
is
likely
to
be

the

has
boosted

arone

of

percent
last

a
positive
sign
for
the
housing
market
which
has
underperformed
the
broader

amid
rising

for

the
strong

pushed
yields
to
a
high
of
percent
and

to
a
high
of

extending
a
rise
in
yields
the
dollar
was
steady
against
the
euro
and
the

come
into

outweighed
an
