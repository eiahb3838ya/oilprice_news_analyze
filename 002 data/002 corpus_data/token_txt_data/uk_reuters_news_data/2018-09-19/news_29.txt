reuters
india
is
considering
asking
the
central
bank
to
offer
dollars
directly
to
oil
marketing
companies
or
through
a
bank
a
government
source
said
on
thursday
as
part
of
steps
to
stem
a
fall
in
the
rupee
as
an
extreme
measure
the
government
could
also
look
at
raising
dollars
by
tapping
expatriates
to
invest
in
bonds
for
indians
said
the
source
who
has
direct
knowledge
of
the
deliberations
over
the
currency
s
fall
the
rupee
is
asia
s
worst
performing
currency
this
year
however
earlier
on
wednesday
it
posted
its
strongest
intraday
gain
since
may
on
hopes
that
oil
companies
which
are
among
the
largest
buyers
of
dollars
in
india
would
now
direct
their
demand
to
the
central
bank
and
not
the
open
market
we
could
ask
the
reserve
bank
of
india
to
earmark
billion
to
billion
a
month
separately
for
the
public
sector
oil
companies
the
source
said
declining
to
be
named
as
the
discussions
continue
as
an
extreme
step
we
would
be
ready
to
raise
dollars
through
finance
ministry
spokesman
malik
declined
to
comment
the
source
said
proposed
restrictions
on
the
import
of
items
may
have
only
a
limited
impact
on
the
falling
rupee
as
the
current
account
deficit
continues
to
widen
the
rupee
has
depreciated
more
than
percent
this
year
closing
at
on
wednesday
after
hitting
a
record
low
of
on
tuesday
the
source
said
it
could
fall
further
once
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
exports
come
into
force
in
november
measures
which
may
limit
global
crude
supplies
and
push
up
prices
during
a
currency
crisis
a
separate
window
for
oil
companies
in
which
the
central
bank
sold
dollars
to
importers
on
a
forward
swap
basis
without
leading
to
a
drain
down
on
foreign
exchange
reserves
helped
push
up
the
rupee
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
solutions
that
should
have
been
done
long
back
said
a
dealer
at
a
foreign
bank
why
are
the
policymakers
waiting
for
people
to
bear
such
huge
losses
on
the
currency
and
not
announcing
this
simple
measure
