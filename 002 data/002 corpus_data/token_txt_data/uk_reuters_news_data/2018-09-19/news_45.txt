focus-norway's aker bets on software engineers for its oil business
stavanger

reuters
when
the
owners
of
norwegian
oil
firm
aker
bp
decided
to
digitize
its
assets
and
operations
they
searched
high
and
low
for
the
right
software
company
but
they
failed
to
find
a
suitable
one
so
instead
they
set
up
their
own
cognite
to
create
digital
maps
of
aker
bp
oil
industry
assets
integrating
data
from
equipment
such
as
pumps
heat
and
pressure
sensors
maintenance
records
and
even
staff
rotas
to
improve
efficiency
and
safety
less
than
two
years
later
cognite
is
selling
its
software
to
aker
bp
s
rivals
and
one
competitor
sweden
s
lundin
petroleum
has
even
agreed
to
share
its
oilfield
data
with
aker
in
what
they
say
is
an
industry
first
this
will
be
the
first
time
two
different
operators
or
oil
companies
will
share
data
live
from
two
producing
fields
that
is
between
edvard
grieg
and
ivar
aasen
a
lundin
norway
representative
told
reuters
by
combining
all
the
data
that
typically
sits
in
different
digital
silos
such
as
matching
flow
sensors
with
the
piece
of
machinery
they
actually
sit
on
cognite
says
its
software
can
help
reduce
maintenance
costs
extend
the
lifespan
of
equipment
and
avoid
damaging
breakdowns
digitizing
industrial
assets
can
also
mean
fewer
people
need
to
be
offshore
less
downtime
for
oil
platforms
more
targeted
maintenance
and
better
analysis
of
information
such
as
geological
data
and
valve
pressures
for
lundin
petroleum
sharing
information
from
its
edvard
grieg
field
on
the
norwegian
continental
shelf
with
aker
bp
s
adjacent
ivar
aasen
field
makes
sense
because
getting
more
production
data
from
a
rival
in
a
similar
geological
area
could
help
it
improve
its
own
oil
output
aker
bp
s
view
is
that
unlike
seismic
data
interpretation
for
oil
exploration
operational
data
is
not
a
strategic
to
be
protected
said
its
chief
karl
johnny
hersvik
for
aker
asa
the
biggest
shareholder
in
aker
bp
and
cognite
the
lundin
petroleum
deal
is
part
of
its
plan
to
create
software
for
an
industry
that
can
be
improved
and
refined
the
more
it
gets
used
by
different
clients
rather
than
just
focusing
on
an
model
for
aker
bp
the
value
that
cognite
s
technology
brings
to
the
aker
companies
will
increase
with
the
number
of
customers
cognite
serves
aker
chief
executive
oeyvind
eriksen
told
reuters
aker
asa
which
together
with
aker
bp
owns
more
than
percent
of
cognite
is
even
considering
floating
the
company
on
the
stock
exchange
within
two
years
controlled
by
norwegian
billionaire
kjell
inge
roekke
here
aker
also
has
interests
in
oil
engineering
and
construction
services
as
well
as
fishing
john
markus
lervik
a
software
engineer
who
founded
cognite
said
it
has
grown
from
just
people
to
about
in
months
has
clients
in
oil
and
shipping
and
is
only
planning
ahead
for
now
because
things
are
happening
so
quickly
it
might
seem
counterintuitive
to
share
technological
expertise
with
rivals
but
by
learning
from
usage
across
companies
and
industries
software
can
be
improved
even
if
no
oilfield
specific
data
is
exchanged
improvements
can
then
be
rolled
out
to
clients
including
aker
bp
to
provide
the
algorithm
and
the
software
to
be
able
to
map
or
connect
sensors
to
the
right
equipment
that
s
a
big
challenge
all
oil
companies
and
also
other
companies
have
lervik
said
the
more
companies
we
work
with
to
create
advanced
algorithms
to
do
this
mapping
the
more
advanced
the
more
automatic
that
mapping
will
while
cognite
is
not
alone
in
developing
systems
that
can
link
masses
of
data
historically
kept
in
different
systems
alfonso
velosa
at
tech
advisory
firm
gartner
reckons
when
it
comes
to
oil
and
gas
aker
is
out
in
front
for
now
those
systems
tended
to
be
stuck
in
proprietary
legacy
systems
and
this
is
now
an
approach
that
is
trying
to
marry
them
together
he
said
this
is
a
trend
that
s
coming
down
and
they
re
just
ahead
of
the
trend

the
moment

to
bring

firm

engineers
chief
strategy
officer
gareth
davies
said
a
new
generation
of
people
entering
the
oil
and
gas
industry
is
partly
behind
the
drive
to
come
up
with
better
digital
systems
the
guys
who
come
in
now
who
are
in
their
expect
to
have
the
information
said
davies
it
s
like
well
you
have
to
go
to
that
system
you
have
to
ask
him
to
log
in
there
and
he
ll
export
it
here
and
they
look
at
you
like
what
are
you
talking
about
that

up

now
this

have
been

davies
