operator
safaricom
said
in
june
it
is
opposed
to
a

rely
on

around
million

nation
of
million
handling
billions
of
shillings
in

lawmakers
voted
to
delay
the
hike
in

the
national
revenue
authority
started
collecting
the
tax
anyway
triggering
a
strike
by
fuel
transporters
and
public
anger
they
also
voted
to
retain
an
interest

the
international
monetary
fund
has
said
must
be
scrapped
or
modified
in
return
for
a
new
standby
arrangement

existing
standby
arrangement
expired

businesses
and
ordinary
people
routinely
complain
of
a
heavy
tax
burden
early

national
chamber
of
commerce
and
industry
kncci
said
the
government
could
widen
the
tax
base
and
increase
the
rate
of
tax
compliance
to
percent
from
the
current
percent
it
also
urged
the
government
to
cut
expenditure
reduce
wastage
of
public
funds
and
deal
with
corruption
which
some
past
studies
have
found
account
for
the
loss
of

a
third
of
