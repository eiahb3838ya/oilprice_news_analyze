coca-cola moving ahead with takeover of nigeria's chi juice
lagos
reuters
is
moving
ahead
with
plans
to
take
over
nigeria
s
leading
juice
company
chi
ltd
and
aims
to
complete
the
deal
early
next
year
a
senior
executive
told
reuters
the
acquisition
for
an
undisclosed
price
is
one
of
several
steps
the
company
is
taking
in
a
global
strategy
to
diversify
from
its
core
business
of
sugary
sodas
last
month
it
agreed
to
buy
costa
coffee
for
billion
and
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
say
it
is
also
bidding
for
glaxosmithkline
s
indian
horlicks
nutrition
business
we
are
still
on
track
to
complete
the
acquisition
of
chi
ltd
by
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
of
peter
njonjo
president
of
s
west
africa
business
said
on
wednesday
bought
a
percent
stake
in
the
nigerian
juice
and
snack
producer
in
january
and
said
at
the
time
it
aimed
to
increase
ownership
within
three
years
juice
sales
form
a
central
plank
of
the
company
s
attempt
to
offer
drinks
at
a
range
of
price
points
in
nigeria
to
improve
affordability
in
a
country
where
njonjo
sees
high
inflation
and
modest
economic
growth
in
the
coming
year
focusing
on
smaller
bottles
and
cans
is
another
way
the
company
is
trying
to
woo
consumers
in
nigeria
which
emerged
from
its
first
recession
in
years
in
but
continues
to
suffer
from
sluggish
growth
and
high
inflation
affordability
will
start
becoming
a
bigger
issue
in
this
market
than
it
was
in
the
past
as
a
company
that
is
what
we
need
to
factor
in
as
we
are
thinking
about
the
future
of
our
business
in
nigeria
njonjo
said
in
an
interview
he
pointed
to
the
introduction
of
a
centilitre
bottle
of
coke
zero
for
naira
compared
with
the
standard
centilitre
bottle
for
naira
as
just
one
example
njonjo
said
the
company
s
drive
to
diversify
its
product
range
could
also
give
it
more
flexibility
in
a
market
where
unemployment
is
high
and
the
united
nations
estimates
most
of
the
population
of
million
lives
on
less
than
pounds
a
day
we
realise
that
in
certain
pack
formats
you
can
only
go
down
so
low
he
said
in
an
interview
at
his
office
in
the
commercial
capital
lagos
but
once
you
start
looking
at
pouches
and
still
products
like
juice
and
drinking
yoghurts
that
allows
you
to
start
accessing
much
lower
price
njonjo
said
the
purchase
of
costa
could
present
a
significant
opportunity
in
nigeria
despite
the
absence
of
a
culture
of
drinking
there
there
definitely
could
be
opportunity
around
coffee
here
in
nigeria
having
iced
coffee
blends
of
dairy
and
coffee
packaged
in
different
formats
he
said
njonjo
said
horlicks
a
hot
beverage
was
an
interesting
proposition
that
could
be
a
significant
opportunity
on
the
african
continent
but
while
the
company
was
researching
drinks
from
locally
relevant
ingredients
such
as
ginger
he
said
he
could
not
see
a
market
for
marijuana
drinks
something
the
company
has
said
it
was
closely
watching
in
the
past
in
january
announced
a
global
goal
to
help
collect
and
recycle
its
packaging
njonjo
said
the
company
was
working
in
nigeria
to
collect
bottles
and
find
a
way
for
them
to
be
through
a
partnership
with
lafarge
in
which
bottles
would
be
burned
in
kilns
as
an
energy
source
a
memorandum
of
understanding
was
being
formalised
and
would
be
signed
in
the
next
few
weeks
he
said
adding
that
implementation
would
begin
in
the
last
quarter
of
this
year
he
said
the
company
was
also
working
with
lagos
state
government
on
marine
collection
to
remove
waste
from
waterways
in
the
city
which
is
built
on
a
lagoon
