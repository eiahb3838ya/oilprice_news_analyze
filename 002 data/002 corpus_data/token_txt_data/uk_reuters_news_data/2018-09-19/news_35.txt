update 2-cuadrilla to start fracking in england in weeks
london
reuters
shale
gas
developer
cuadrilla
will
start
fracking
at
its
preston
new
road
site
in
northwest
england
in
the
next
few
weeks
it
said
on
wednesday
as
it
announced
government
approval
for
a
second
well
hydraulically
fracturing
or
fracking
involves
extracting
gas
from
rocks
by
breaking
them
up
with
water
and
chemicals
at
high
pressure
and
was
halted
in
britain
seven
years
ago
after
causing
earth
tremors
but
the
british
government
keen
to
cut
its
reliance
on
imports
as
north
sea
supplies
dry
up
has
tightened
regulation
of
the
industry
and
gave
consent
in
july
for
cuadrilla
to
start
fracking
a
first
well
at
preston
new
road
after
approval
for
a
second
well
at
the
site
cuadrilla
said
on
wednesday
that
it
would
begin
work
in
readiness
to
start
hydraulically
fracturing
both
wells
in
the
next
few
weeks
cuadrilla
said
it
would
run
an
initial
flow
test
of
the
gas
produced
from
both
wells
for
approximately
six
months
the
british
geological
survey
estimates
shale
gas
resources
in
northern
england
alone
could
amount
to
trillion
cubic
feet
tcf
of
gas
percent
of
which
could
meet
the
country
s
demand
for
almost
years
however
attempts
to
extract
the
gas
have
come
under
fire
from
local
communities
and
campaigners
concerned
about
the
potential
effect
on
the
environment
and
ground
water
and
arguing
that
extracting
more
fossil
fuel
is
at
odds
with
the
country
s
commitment
to
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions

minister
claire
perry
said
consent
for
the
second
well
had
been
granted
after
the
company
had
met
a
number
of
criteria
including
showing
it
had
the
necessary
funds
to
carry
out
work
at
the
site
until
at
least
june
shale
gas
has
the
potential
to
be
a
new
domestic
energy
source
further
enhancing
our
energy
security
and
helping
us
with
our
continued
transition
to
a
economy
she
said
in
an
emailed
statement
cuadrilla
first
attempted
to
frack
gas
near
blackpool
in
the
northwest
of
england
in
but
the
practice
led
to
an
earth
tremor
registering
on
the
richter
scale
the
company
said
the
quakes
were
caused
by
an
unusual
combination
of
geological
features
at
the
site
but
they
led
to
an
nationwide
ban
on
fracking
while
further
research
was
carried
out
the
government
has
since
introduced
a
system
that
immediately
suspends
work
if
seismic
activity
of
or
above
on
the
richter
scale
is
detected
it
has
also
increased
monitoring
standards
including
checks
on
ground
water
fracking
consent
was
introduced
in
as
an
additional
step
to
the
government
s
regulatory
regime
and
ensures
environmental
health
and
safety
permits
have
been
obtained
our
world
class
regulations
will
ensure
that
shale
exploration
will
maintain
robust
environmental
standards
and
meet
the
expectations
of
local
communities
