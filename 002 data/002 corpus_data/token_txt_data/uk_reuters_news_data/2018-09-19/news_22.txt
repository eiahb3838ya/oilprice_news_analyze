exclusive-russian oil firm seeks dollar alternative amid us sanctions threat-traders
moscow
reuters
russian
oil
producer
surgutneftegaz
is
pushing
buyers
to
agree
to
pay
for
oil
in
euros
instead
of
dollars
if
the
need
arises
apparently
as
insurance
against
possible
tougher
sanctions
traders
who
deal
with
the
firm
told
reuters
russia
has
been
subject
to
western
sanctions
since
its
annexation
of
ukraine
s
crimea
region
but
washington
has
threatened
to
impose
extra
sanctions
citing
what
it
has
called
moscow
s
malign
activities
abroad
the
prospect
that
causes
most
alarm
for
russian
firms
is
inclusion
on
a
treasury
department
blacklist
that
effectively
cuts
them
off
from
conducting
transactions
in
dollars
the
lifeblood
of
the
global
oil
industry
surgutneftegaz
whose
chief
executive
vladimir
bogdanov
is
already
on
a
blacklist
in
a
personal
capacity
declined
to
respond
to
reuters
questions
we
do
not
comment
on
our
commercial
activity
said
the
company
russia
s
fourth
largest
by
output
to
date
russia
s
oil
industry
has
been
able
to
weather
western
sanctions
in
response
to
restricted
access
to
western
finance
and
technology
firms
have
switched
to
borrowing
from
russian
state
banks
and
developed
their
own
technology
most
russian
oil
majors
including
rosneft
and
lukoil
also
sell
the
lion
s
share
of
output
via
contracts
with
clients
giving
them
more
time
to
work
out
alternative
forms
of
payment
when
the
contracts
expire
but
most
of
surgutneftegaz
s
exports
around
million
tonnes
per
month
is
sold
through
monthly
tenders
on
the
spot
market
the
largest
volumes
by
far
among
its
russian
peers
so
it
would
have
only
around
days
to
find
alternative
payment
methods
six
traders
who
regularly
deal
with
surgutneftegaz
said
the
company
had
been
asking
buyers
to
agree
to
an
addendum
to
their
contracts
stating
that
they
accept
the
option
of
settling
payments
in
euros
according
to
a
message
sent
by
surgutneftegaz
to
one
of
its
customers
asking
them
to
sign
the
addendum
the
oil
company
cited
the
need
to
avoid
any
possible
problems
with
payment
in
reuters
has
seen
a
copy
of
the
message
three
of
the
traders
said
surgutneftegaz
had
already
begun
discussions
with
its
partners
last
summer
about
the
possibility
of
settling
payments
in
euros
but
the
company
was
now
raising
the
issue
with
greater
urgency
and
had
in
some
cases
warned
it
would
reject
bids
from
buyers
for
cargoes
of
oil
unless
the
buyers
signed
the
addendum
according
to
four
of
the
traders
in
its
message
to
customers
surgutneftegaz
did
not
mention
the
risk
of
new
sanctions
but
two
traders
said
from
their
interactions
with
the
company
it
was
clear
to
them
that
this
was
the
reason
behind
the
change
surgut
is
afraid
of
sanctions
a
source
in
a
european
oil
major
which
has
dealings
with
surgutneftegaz
told
reuters
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
he
is
not
authorized
to
speak
to
the
media
the
government
can
not
forbid
anyone
from
using
dollars
but
it
can
prevent
banks
from
doing
business
with
a
sanctioned
entity
most
transactions
pass
through
the
banking
system
and
those
banks
to
avoid
violating
sanctions
can
refuse
to
handle
money
linked
to
blacklisted
companies
or
individuals
it
is
not
clear
how
widely
the
russian
oil
sector
is
preparing
for
the
possibility
of
tougher
sanctions
a
source
at
gazpromneft
russia
s
oil
company
by
output
said
most
of
its
contracts
already
contained
a
clause
on
possible
payments
in
currencies
a
second
source
at
the
company
said
that
when
it
is
drafting
supply
contracts
with
customers
for
it
will
make
sure
they
include
a
payment
option
in
all
cases
gazpromneft
was
not
immediately
available
to
comment
several
other
oil
firms
also
already
have
clauses
in
their
contracts
allowing
payments
under
some
circumstances
said
four
industry
sources
washington
s
decision
in
april
to
include
on
its
sanctions
blacklist
russian
firm
rusal
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
aluminum
producers
signaled
to
russian
business
that
washington
was
ratcheting
up
the
pressure
it
was
the
first
time
a
major
russian
company
with
international
partners
had
been
blacklisted
some
elements
of
the
sanctions
have
been
temporarily
watered
down
but
rusal
s
inclusion
has
disrupted
its
access
to
raw
materials
led
to
the
cancellation
of
some
orders
and
prompted
some
foreign
partners
to
sever
ties
washington
has
not
spelled
out
when
or
how
it
plans
to
toughen
sanctions
further
but
it
has
signaled
that
they
are
coming
this
year
partly
in
response
to
the
poisoning
in
britain
of
former
russian
spy
sergei
skripal
and
his
daughter
britain
and
its
western
allies
say
russian
intelligence
agents
carried
out
the
poisoning
using
a
nerve
agent
an
allegation
moscow
has
denied
state
department
official
manisha
singh
said
this
month
there
would
be
a
very
severe
second
round
of
sanctions
unless
russia
meets
a
november
deadline
to
comply
with
international
chemical
weapons
law
the
source
in
the
european
oil
major
said
surgutneftegaz
in
its
push
to
arrange
the
option
of
payments
in
euros
was
focused
on
what
might
happen
in
november
there
is
no
indication
from
washington
if
surgutneftegaz
would
be
a
target
for
the
next
round
of
sanctions
but
ceo
bogdanov
was
included
on
the
treasury
department
list
published
in
january
of
russian
oligarchs
with
a
net
worth
of
billion
or
more
in
april
the
treasury
department
added
bogdanov
to
its
specially
designated
national
list
freezing
any
assets
he
owns
and
barring
him
from
travel
to
the
united
states
it
said
he
was
being
blacklisted
for
operating
in
the
energy
sector
of
the
russian
federation
