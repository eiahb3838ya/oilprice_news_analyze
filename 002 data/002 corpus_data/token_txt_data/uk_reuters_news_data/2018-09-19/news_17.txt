severe
flooding
on
the
amazon
has
increased
amid
changing
weather
patterns
and
is
harming
the
health
and
incomes
of
people
living
along
the
world
s
biggest
river
scientists
said
analysing
more
than
years
of
records
measuring
amazon
river
levels
in
the
port
of
manaus
in
brazil
they
found
extreme
floods
that
occurred
roughly
once
every
years
in
the
first
part
of
last
century
are
now
happening
about
every
four
years
there
are
catastrophic
effects
on
the
lives
of
the
people
as
the
drinking
water
gets
flooded
and
the
houses
get
completely
destroyed
said
jonathan
barichivich
environmental
scientist
at
the
universidad
austral
de
chile
our
findings
unravel
the
ultimate
causes
of
the
recent
intensification
wet
season
getting
wetter
and
dry
season
getting
drier
of
the
water
cycle
of
the
largest
hydrological
basin
of
the
planet
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
droughts
have
also
become
more
frequent
in
the
past
two
to
three
decades
but
the
rise
in
flooding
stood
out
he
noted
in
a
paper
published
on
wednesday
in
the
journal
science
advances
researchers
from
institutions
including
britain
s
university
of
leeds
said
severe
flooding
had
affected
the
amazon
basin
nearly
every
year
from
to
they
linked
the
increase
in
flooding
to
a
combination
of
warmer
temperatures
over
the
atlantic
ocean
and
cooler
temperatures
over
the
pacific
known
as
the
walker
circulation
this
effect
influences
tropical
weather
patterns
and
can
partly
be
attributed
to
shifts
in
wind
belts
caused
by
global
warming
the
study
said
with
temperatures
in
the
atlantic
expected
to
rise
more
than
in
the
pacific
flood
risks
on
the
amazon
river
will
persist
the
scientists
predicted
we
think
that
it
s
going
to
continue
for
at
least
a
decade
said
barichivich
formerly
a
university
of
leeds
research
fellow
the
paper
also
noted
that
deforestation
and
construction
of
plants
could
play
a
role
in
changes
besides
disrupting
cattle
ranching
and
agriculture
on
the
river
s
flood
plains
heavy
flooding
has
health
consequences
for
communities
in
brazil
peru
and
other
amazon
nations
as
it
contaminates
water
and
helps
spread
disease
said
the
study
monitoring
changes
in
river
levels
is
important
because
the
amazon
basin
and
its
tropical
rainforest
play
a
major
role
in
the
world
hydrological
and
carbon
systems
