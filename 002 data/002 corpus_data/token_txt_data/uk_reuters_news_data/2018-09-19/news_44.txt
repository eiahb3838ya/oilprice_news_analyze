global

this

looked
past
the

seen
by
some
market
participants
as
less
severe
than
expected
hong

wrote
china
was
likely
to
step
up
policy
easing
as
a
buffer
against
the
negative
effects
of
higher
tariffs
in
our
view
both
monetary
and
fiscal
easing
will
likely
be
rolled
out
to
boost
domestic
demand

stabilise

said
on

it
will
implement
new
tariffs
of

on
billion
of
chinese

hit
back
saying
it
will
levy
tariffs
on
about
billion
worth
of
goods
as
previously
planned
but
cut
the
tariff
rates
there
was
relief
as
the
united
states
set
the
initial
tariffs
at
percent
rather
than
the
expected
percent
seen
by
some
as
a
gesture
that
it
was
buying
time
for
further
negotiations

masahiro
ichikawa
senior

asset
management
in
tokyo
while
global
market
reaction
to
the
latest
phase
of
the
trade
dispute
has
been
relatively
limited
the
row
was
expected
to
heat
up
a
major
worry
for
investors
in
reaction
to
china
s
latest
retaliatory
move
trump
is
now
highly
likely
to
hit
back
by
adding
tariffs
to
another
billion
of

goods
the
trade
war
will
only
escalate
said
yoshimasa
maruyama
chief
market
economist
at
smbc
nikko
securities
in
tokyo
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
china
holds
back
its
anger
and
still
holds
negotiations
with
the
united
states
but
if
it
opts
not
to
we
ll
have
to
brace
for
the
trade
conflict

secretary
steven
mnuchin
last

invited
top
chinese
officials
to
a

from

would
not
weaken

the
