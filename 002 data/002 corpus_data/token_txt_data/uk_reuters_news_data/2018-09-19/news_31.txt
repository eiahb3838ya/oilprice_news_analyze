frankfurt
reuters
a
looming
ban
on
older
diesel
vehicles
from
germany
s
financial
capital
faces
a
legal
challenge
from
the
state
government
deepening
controversy
over
how
to
handle
the
fallout
from
an
emissions
cheating
scandal
that
has
rocked
the
car
industry
the
state
government
of
hesse
said
on
wednesday
it
would
appeal
a
court
decision
that
would
ban
highly
polluting
older
models
from
the
streets
of
frankfurt
from
next
february
frankfurt
is
emerging
as
a
test
case
on
how
to
handle
rising
air
pollution
in
german
cities
following
a
landmark
ruling
by
the
country
s
top
federal
court
in
february
that
opened
the
door
to
such
bans
hesse
s
prime
minister
volker
bouffier
a
member
of
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
christian
democrats
who
is
fighting
a
regional
election
in
october
said
a
series
of
measures
he
proposes
would
do
as
good
a
job
as
the
diesel
ban
planned
measures
such
as
deploying
electric
buses
building
better
cycle
paths
and
more
offerings
would
in
practice
have
the
same
effect
as
a
general
driving
ban
he
said
in
a
joint
statement
with
environment
minister
priska
hinz
the
proposed
bans
follow
scandals
at
volkswagen
ag
and
other
german
carmakers
that
were
found
to
have
exceeded
emissions
limits
leaving
vehicles
on
the
road
that
are
far
more
polluting
than
their
buyers
were
led
to
believe
merkel
s
government
has
meanwhile
dithered
over
whether
to
require
manufacturers
to
carry
out
costly
retrofits
on
older
models
with
systems
that
would
help
reduce
urban
air
pollution
around
a
quarter
of
the
cars
on
the
roads
of
frankfurt
whose
population
nearly
doubles
by
day
as
commuters
come
into
the
city
would
be
affected
by
the
ban
at
first
diesel
cars
meeting
standards
and
vehicles
running
to
and
would
be
barred
from
the
city
the
ban
would
be
extended
to
diesels
from
next
september
but
not
to
newer
models
deutsche
umwelthilfe
the
environmental
group
that
brought
the
frankfurt
case
argues
banning
diesels
is
the
only
way
to
meet
european
union
clean
air
rules
which
stipulate
that
nitrogen
dioxide
pollution
should
not
exceed
micrograms
per
cubic
meter
of
air
on
average
the
city
of
hamburg
this
year
voluntarily
blocked
diesel
models
that
fail
to
meet
the
emissions
standard
from
selected
trunk
roads
other
cities
including
aachen
duesseldorf
and
stuttgart
are
also
considering
bans
