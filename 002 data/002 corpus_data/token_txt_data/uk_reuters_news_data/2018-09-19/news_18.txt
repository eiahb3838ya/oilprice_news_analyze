the
french
government
plans
to
reform
the
way
independent
power
firms
buy
nuclear
electricity
from
edf
but
has
drawn
criticism
from
the
smaller
firms
which
say
the
draft
proposals
will
reduce
competition
and
increase
their
costs
under
the
existing
arenh
mechanism
edf
offers
up
to
twh
per
year
or
about
a
quarter
of
its
french
nuclear
production
to
its
smaller
rivals
for
delivery
at
a
fixed
price
of
euros
per
megawatt
the
mechanism
was
set
up
to
encourage
competition
and
offset
edf
s
monopoly
on
nuclear
power
production
edf
operates
all
of
france
s
nuclear
reactors
that
generate
more
than
percent
of
the
nation
s
electricity
needs
edf
has
long
complained
the
mechanism
gives
rivals
unfair
access
to
its
nuclear
output
and
says
competitors
profit
from
arbitrage
trade
buying
power
via
the
arenh
window
at
a
fixed
price
and
reselling
it
when
wholesale
market
prices
are
higher
the
proposed
reform
aims
to
curb
this
arbitrage
by
setting
new
conditions
for
purchasing
nuclear
power
changing
quantities
allocated
for
a
given
period
and
locking
buyers
into
contracts
the
draft
reform
seen
by
reuters
showed
the
proposed
reform
poses
a
serious
threat
to
competition
in
the
electricity
market
the
independent
power
providers
said
in
a
statement
sent
through
their
gas
and
power
lobby
groups
they
said
the
reform
would
mean
they
would
carry
more
risk
would
have
less
visibility
about
the
volume
they
would
receive
and
would
face
increased
costs
for
accessing
the
mechanism
under
the
changes
sales
of
nuclear
power
under
the
arenh
mechanism
would
be
staggered
with
percent
of
the
twh
sold
on
percent
on
july
and
percent
on
supplies
would
be
delivered
from
the
following
january
currently
independent
providers
bid
for
the
whole
arenh
volume
at
the
same
time
in
november
with
delivery
made
from
january
the
following
year
the
independent
providers
have
urged
the
french
new
energy
minister
fran√ßois
de
rugy
to
halt
the
reform
and
increase
their
access
to
edf
s
nuclear
power
the
reform
could
artificially
reduce
the
size
of
the
arenh
mechanism
a
source
at
one
independent
power
provider
said
adding
the
changes
could
violate
european
competition
laws
french
and
european
electricity
contracts
for
delivery
have
soared
well
above
the
arenh
price
in
recent
weeks
tracking
gains
in
coal
gas
and
european
carbon
emission
prices
