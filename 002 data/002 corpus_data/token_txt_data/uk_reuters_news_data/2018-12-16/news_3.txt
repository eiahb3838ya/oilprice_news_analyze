fractious
climate
change
talks
in
poland
showed
the
limits
of
international
action
to
limit
global
warming
in
a
polarized
world
putting
the
onus
on
individual
governments
cities
and
communities
to
stop
temperatures
rising
nearly
countries
at
the
united
nations
talks
in
katowice
in
the
coal
mining
region
of
silesia
saved
the
landmark
paris
agreement
from
disintegration
on
saturday
by
agreeing
a
package
of
guidelines
for
its
implementation
but
it
deferred
rules
on
carbon
credits
a
spur
to
business
and
lacked
any
firm
commitment
to
strengthen
countries
emissions
cut
targets
by
when
the
agreement
comes
into
force
as
such
it
left
the
parties
a
long
way
from
the
paris
deal
s
goal
of
keeping
global
warming
below
degrees
celsius
let
alone
the
cap
of

to
avert
more
extreme

rising

and
the

of

and
animal
species
the
world
is
heading
for
a
rise
in
temperatures
this
century
the
world
meteorological
organization
has
said
the
paris
agreement
is
based
on
individual
commitments
and
expectations
for
the
polish
talks
to
produce
much
more
than
rules
for
how
those
would
be
measured
had
always
been
low
the
unity
built
in
paris
had
been
shattered
by
a
wave
of
governments
placing
national
agendas
before
collective
action
only
a
handful
of
country
leaders
were
present
in
katowice
and
the
had
to
fly
back
to
the
meeting
to
urge
progress
political
will

missing
alden
meyer
director
at
the
union
of
concerned
scientists
a
science
advocacy
group
said
as
the
conference
staggered
towards
a
finish
delayed
for
more
than
hours
by
wrangling
over
parts
of
the
text
but
it
provides
the
hooks
for
governments
cities
businesses
civil
society
etc
to
do
the
work
to
get
to
the
paris
agreement
goals
he
said
for
conference
president
michal
kurtyka
it
was
a
job
well
done
mission
accomplished
he
wrote
on
twitter
our
children
look
back
at
our
legacy
and
recognize
that
we
took
the
right
decisions
at
important
junctures
like
the
one
we
face
for
nations
already
suffering
from
climate
change
the
agreement
which
did
not
make
clear
how
pledged
funding
would
be
provided
was
only
just
better
than
nothing
simon
stiell
environment
minister
of
grenada
in
the
caribbean
told
reuters
it
is
barely
scratching
the
surface
of
what
we
really
require
investors
said
it
would
take
more
action
at
government
level
to
persuade
them
to
pump
in
the
amount
of
money
needed
those
countries
who
push
ahead
with
ambitious
climate
policies
will
be
the
ones
to
reap
the
investment
and
economic
advantages
of
doing
so
said
stephanie
pfeifer
chief
executive
of
institutional
investors
group
on
climate
change
noting
the
transition
was
already
underway
the
united
states
set
to
withdraw
from
the
process
at
the
behest
of
president
donald
trump
staged
an
event
touting
the
benefits
of
burning
fossil
fuels
including
coal
more
efficiently
while
back
at
home
trump
has
termed
the
paris
deal
ridiculous
a
scientific
report
requested
by
the
paris
signatories
said
the
share
of
power
would
have
to
be
cut
to
under
percent
by
along
with
big
cuts
to
other
fossil
fuels
to
stop
temperatures
rising
more
than
and
causing
devastating
floods
storms
heat
waves
and
drought
the
united
states
as
well
as
fellow
oil
producers
saudi
arabia
russia
and
kuwait
refused
to
welcome
the
report
a
term
sought
by
countries
seeking
to
focus
minds
on
its
findings
the
final
statement
merely
welcomed
its
timely
completion
and
invited
parties
to
make
use
of
the
information
it
contained
yet
the
row
over
the
report
was
far
from
the
only
one
china
india
russia
australia
japan
brazil
and
the
european
union
were
all
drawn
into
various
rifts
although
china
won
some
praise
for
helping
to
overcome
concern
especially
from
the
united
states
that
it
would
sidestep
any
rules
i
think
they
have
come
a
long
way
in
recognizing
they
need
to
provide
confidence
jennifer
morgan
executive
director
of
greenpeace
international
said
of
the
chinese
negotiators
describing
washington
as
out
of
touch
morgan
noted
the
rules
agreed
in
poland
nevertheless
bound
all
countries
including
the
united
states
until
its
planned
withdrawal
in
an
achievement
in
itself
but
that
substitute
for
the
need
to
build
ambition
she
said
poland
hosting
its
third
climate
conference
came
in
for
criticism
for
its
commitment
to
coal
the
most
polluting
of
fossil
fuels
the
meeting
s
final
statement
merely
noted
warsaw
s
call
for
a
just
transition
allowing
communities
dependent
on
coal
more
time
to
adjust
the
appointment
of
kurtyka
poland
s
deputy
environment
minister
to
preside
over
the
talks
appeased
some
campaigners
angered
by
the
government
s
previous
choice
former
environment
minister
jan
szyszko
szyszko
had
expressed
doubts
that
global
warming
is
manmade
in
the
past
and
increased
logging
in
the
ancient
forest
of
bialowieza
declared
illegal
by
the
european
union
s
top
court
however
kurtyka
s
job
was
complicated
by
poland
s
environment
minister
saying
he
did
not
want
discussion
about
raising
ambition
at
the
talks
and
poland
s
president
vowing
not
to
let
anyone
murder
coal
mining
a
focus
on
technicalities
in
the
first
week
was
interpreted
by
campaigners
as
a
pretext
to
avoid
discussions
on
pledging
deeper
emissions
cuts
kurtyka
got
countries
to
focus
on
the
guidelines
near
the
end
of
the
second
week
but
there
was
no
collective
action
to
harmonize
or
improve
disparate
pledges
each
delegation
has
its
own
domestic
interests
our
role
as
the
presidency
is
to
find
balance
which
ensures
reaching
a
compromise
adam
poland
s
chief
negotiator
said
in
the
second
week
of
talks
poland
s
ruling
party
the
law
and
justice
pis
wants
to
scale
back
the
share
of
coal
in
electricity
production
from
percent
to
percent
by
but
the
production
of
hard
coal
is
expected
to
be
stable
for
decades
although
percent
of
poles
think
it
should
be
gradually
phased
out
to
reduce
emissions
according
to
a
survey
by
pollster
cbos
in
november
katowice
the
heart
of
poland
s
coal
region
is
among
the
most
polluted
cities
in
europe
because
many
people
heat
their
homes
by
burning
low
quality
coal
which
is
the
cheapest
residents
say
they
have
no
choice
no
climate
decisions
even
the
best
ones
will
change
the
content
of
our
wallets
