manuel
lopez
obrador
who
took
office
on
wants
to
revive

has
become
heavily
indebted
as

fell
from
a
peak
of
nearly
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in

less
than
million
in

it

output

the
pemex
ceo
said
however
projections
presented
in
the
government
s
first

later

continue
falling
until
mexico
s
previous
government
sought
to
increase
production
by
opening
up
production
and
exploration
to
private
capital
but
the
decline
has
yet
to
bottom
out
lopez
obrador
an
admirer
of
lazaro
cardenas
the
president
who
nationalized
mexico
s
oil
industry
years
ago
was
opposed
to
the
constitutional
overhaul
of
the
industry
carried
out
by
his
predecessor
enrique
pena
nieto
the
veteran
leftist
says
he
will
respect
private
oil
contracts
awarded
under
pena
nieto
but
this
month
challenged
oil
majors
to
start
pumping
oil
quickly
offering
them
a
truce
without
giving
further
details
in
the
meantime
mexico
will
speed
up
exploitation
of
mostly
offshore
fields
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
romero
said
to
this
end
contracts
for
the
necessary
infrastructure
will
be
awarded
on
and
to
drill
wells
on
he
added
most
of
the
fields
are
offshore
and
the
government
plans
to
issue
integrated
infrastructure
contracts
romero
said
the
drilling
of
the
wells
would
be
turnkey
contracts
that
made
the
companies
or
consortiums
responsible
for
delivery
pemex
will
be
responsible
for
the
engineering
and
supervision
of
the
services
by
december
the
fields
should
yield
bpd
of
output
romero
said
energy
secretary
rocio
nahle
told
reporters
in
the
city
that
priority
would
be
given
to
mexican
firms
in
the
contracting
process
based
on
a
restricted
list
of
invitees
romero
said
nine
companies
had
expressed
interest
in
drilling
the
offshore
wells
and
five
others
had
done
so
for
the
four
onshore
fields
all
are
