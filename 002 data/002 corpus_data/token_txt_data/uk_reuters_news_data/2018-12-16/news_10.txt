unlike
power
prices
which
typically

once
a
year
gas
prices
move
every

in
france
and
are
set
using
a
formula

production

many
french
governments
have
postponed
tariff
increases
to
protect
consumers
and
their
own
approval
ratings
in
the
past
but
legally
the
government
has
no
authority
to
set
prices
earlier
this
month
the
government
suspended
increases
to
fuel
taxes
for
at
least
six
months
in
response
to
weeks
of
sometimes
violent
public
protests
against
president
emmanuel
macron
s
policies
and
said
it
would
keep
gas
and
power
prices
unchanged
this
winter
the
environment
ministry
said
on
sunday
it
wanted
to
ensure
engie
s
gas
prices
do
not
change
until
june
but
gave
no
explanation
on
the
new
timeframe
of
the
requested
price
freeze

at
the
environment
ministry
were
not
immediately
available
to
comment
engie
has
taken
notice
of
the
government
s
request
and
will
realise
the
necessary
operations
in
order
to
guarantee
the
stability
