in
discretionary

up
about
percent
from

almost
half
the

budget
is
earmarked
for
exploration
and
production
mostly
in
shallow

and
some
onshore
areas
setting
out
his
plans
on
saturday
pemex
chief
executive
octavio
romero
said
two
previous
governments
had
little
to
show
for
putting
percent
of
exploration
funding
into
deep
waters
at
best
we
d
have
the
first
drop
of

by
he
said
mexican
crude
output
has
fallen
for
straight
years
pemex
aims
to
increase
production
by
almost
percent
by
the
end
of
the
term
of
lopez
obrador
who
wants
to
reduce
mexico
s
dependence
on

spending
almost
billion
on
an
oil

is
building
at

pemex

all
other

monroy
a
mexico
oil
analyst
another
million
in
funding
is
planned
for
upgrades
to
pemex
s
six
existing
domestic
refineries
the
plan
cuts
funding
for
units
focused
on
fertilizers
ethylene
drilling
services
and
its
corporate
offices
the
budget
also
provides
for
about
billion
in
spending
to
cover
costs
like
debt
servicing
pemex
has
financial
debts
of
some
billion
among
other
hefty
obligations
fuelling
concern
over
its
credit
rating
pemex
is
and
the
senior

is
by

the
chief

and
the
chairman
of
the

who

also
the

minister
monroy
identified
two
planned
exploration
and
production
outlays
as
potential
headaches
due

their
complexity
and
cost
chicontepec
a
tight
oil
onshore
project
and

deepwater
scheme
budgeted

lopez
obrador
firmly
opposed
the
constitutional
overhaul
championed
by
his
predecessor
who
ended
pemex
s
monopoly
and
allowed
foreign
and
private
producers
to
bid
on
developing
oil
and
gas
projects
for
the
first
time
the
shakeup
also
allowed
pemex
to
form
joint
ventures
a
common
practice
in
the
industry
aimed
at
sharing
risks
and
rewards
that
lopez
obrador
has
yet
to
embrace
or
reject
earlier
this
month
energy
minister
rocio
nahle
said
two
onshore
auctions
scheduled
for
february
would
be
cancelled
mexico
s
oil
regulator
later
said
auctions
due
at
the
same
time
for
the
right
to
partner
with
pemex
on
seven
onshore
contracts
had
been
postponed
until
next
october
in
the
past
three
years
pemex
has
inked
three
joint
ventures
including
one
with
australia
s
bhp
billiton
for
the
deepwater
trion
project
while
pemex
cedes
control
on
these
projects
it
attracts
significant
investment
from
partners
without
having
to
pledge
much
of
its
own
funding
during
the
initial
phase
lopez
obrador
will
need
to
authorize
more
pemex
joint
ventures
also
known
as
to
reach
his
goal
of
boosting
crude
output
to
million
bpd
in
six
years
from
million
now
said
raul
feliz
an
economist
at
the
cide
think
tank
if
pemex
has
to
do
it
all
by
itself
with
this
level
of
funding
it
won
t
be
enough
