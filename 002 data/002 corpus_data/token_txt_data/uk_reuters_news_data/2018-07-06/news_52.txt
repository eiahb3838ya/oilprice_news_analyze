the
united
states
and
saudi
arabia
appear
to
have
reached
an
understanding
washington
will
reduce
or
eliminate
iran
s
oil
export
revenues
and
in
return
riyadh
will
guarantee
oil
supplies
and
stabilise
prices
the
basic
deal
is
well
understood
by
policymakers
in
both
countries
with
president
donald
trump
repeatedly
emphasising
his
great
personal
relationship
with
the
saudi
king
and
crown
prince
but
strong
personal
relationships
between
the
leaders
and
agreement
on
the
overall
deal
obscure
disagreement
on
some
key
details
not
least
the
desirable
level
for
oil
prices
saudi
arabia
and
its
allies
believe
prices
should
be
stabilised
around
a
barrel
trump
meanwhile
clearly
thinks
they
should
be
stabilised
at
a
significantly
lower
level
trump
made
the
link
between
iran
sanctions
and
saudi
production
policy
explicit
in
a
television
interview
with
fox
news
on
july
the
united
states
will
counter
the
influence
of
iran
saudi
arabia
s
major
regional
rival
by
imposing
tough
sanctions
in
return
saudi
arabia
will
protect
motorists
against
an
increase
in
gasoline
prices
the
president
noted
that
the
united
states
provides
security
for
saudi
arabia
and
other
arab
gulf
countries
through
the
presence
of
military
forces
in
the
region
we
are
protecting
those
countries
many
of
those
countries
he
said
in
a
twitter
message
on
july
the
president
said
that
the
united
states
defends
many
of
those
countries
for
very
little
s
and
saudi
objectives
are
not
fully
aligned
however
on
oil
prices
saudi
arabia
s
objective
revealed
at
the
opec
meeting
in
june
has
been
to
stabilise
production
and
prices
around
current
levels
the
kingdom
its
gulf
allies
and
russia
indicated
that
they
will
lift
production
by
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
offset
losses
from
venezuela
and
iran
but
not
more
the
implication
is
that
saudi
arabia
wants
to
keep
prices
around
a
barrel
and
sees
that
level
as
sustainable
in
the
medium
term
trump
however
is
not
satisfied
with
either
the
current
level
of
oil
prices
or
the
announced
production
increase
they
have
to
put
out
another
million
barrels
in
my
opinion
he
said
in
the
july
fox
interview
gas
prices
are
up
they
are
doing
little
to
help
he
complained
again
on
twitter
on
july
this
must
be
a
street
reduce
pricing
now
the
united
states
has
always
been
both
a
major
producer
and
consumer
of
oil
which
means
that
most
presidents
have
favoured
moderate
oil
prices
high
prices
hurt
motorists
and
oil
consumers
across
the
country
low
prices
hurt
producers
concentrated
in
texas
and
other
major
petroleum
states
from
the
perspective
of
the
white
house
the
ideal
price
is
not
so
low
it
causes
problems
for
producing
states
but
not
so
high
it
hurts
consuming
states
the
rise
in
benchmark
crude
prices
from
a
low
of
less
than
a
barrel
in
february
to
more
than
in
july
has
boosted
the
economies
of
texas
oklahoma
north
dakota
and
other
producing
states
but
most
of
those
states
are
solidly
republican
and
likely
to
vote
trump
s
party
at
the
congressional
elections
in
the
president
therefore
is
paying
much
closer
attention
to
the
harmful
impact
of
higher
oil
and
gasoline
prices
on
consumers
in
swing
states
the
president
s
repeated
criticism
of
opec
reflects
his
awareness
that
higher
prices
are
already
hitting
a
key
section
of
his
own
electoral
coalition
the
average
cost
of
gasoline
has
risen
almost
percent
from
a
cyclical
low
of
a
gallon
in
february
to
last
month
motorists
consume
almost
billion
gallons
of
gasoline
each
year
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
most
is
used
by
private
motorists
though
some
is
bought
by
businesses
governments
the
postal
service
and
the
armed
services
total
annualised
expenditure
on
gasoline
has
already
risen
by
about
billion
a
year
over
the
past
months
every
extra
dollar
on
the
price
of
a
barrel
of
crude
costs
consumers
roughly
billion
a
year
assuming
refining
margins
and
fuel
taxes
remain
constant
and
ignoring
gasoline
consumption
by
businesses
and
the
like
rising
gasoline
prices
have
a
similar
impact
to
a
personal
tax
increase
and
have
already
countered
much
of
the
benefit
from
individual
income
tax
cuts
passed
at
the
end
of
if
the
impact
on
consumer
finances
still
seems
small
a
better
way
to
understand
the
effect
is
to
put
the
price
impact
on
the
same
basis
as
the
announced
tax
cuts
budget
analysts
generally
look
at
the
impact
of
tax
changes
over
a
period
estimated
budget
effects
of
the
conference
agreement
for
hr
joint
committee
on
taxation
the
tax
cuts
approved
at
the
end
of
were
estimated
to
reduce
individual
income
taxes
by
a
little
more
than
trillion
over
ten
years
by
comparison
the
rise
in
oil
prices
since
the
start
of
is
the
equivalent
of
a
tax
increase
of
almost
trillion
over
the
next
decade
the
net
impact
of
higher
oil
prices
on
the
economy
as
a
whole
is
obviously
smaller
because
much
of
the
extra
revenue
will
be
received
by
domestic
oil
producers
but
producers
and
consumers
are
not
the
same
and
the
redistribution
of
income
has
real
economic
and
political
consequences
for
many
households
the
gains
from
cuts
passed
last
year
have
been
offset
by
the
rise
in
oil
prices
since
while
tax
cuts
went
mostly
to
individuals
in
the
upper
income
ranges
the
burden
of
higher
gasoline
prices
will
be
felt
mostly
by
individuals
on
lower
incomes
because
they
spend
a
higher
proportion
of
their
earnings
on
fuel
distribution
effects
of
the
conference
agreement
for
hr
jct
with
critical
elections
ahead
the
president
has
to
be
sensitive
to
the
financial
impact
of
higher
fuel
prices
on
swing
voters
which
is
why
he
is
pressing
opec
and
saudi
arabia
to
boost
output
enough
to
lower
