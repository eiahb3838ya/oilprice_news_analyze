update 3-vw loses bid to block investigators examining legal files
karlsruhe
germany
reuters
volkswagen
has
lost
a
legal
challenge
to
prevent
prosecutors
from
examining
unpublished
documents
about
its
emission
scandal
with
germany
s
top
court
ruling
on
friday
that
files
seized
from
a
law
firm
may
be
reviewed
it
means
the
information
from
the
files
may
be
made
public
as
part
of
any
criminal
proceedings
thus
providing
more
ammunition
for
shareholders
and
car
owners
seeking
damages
shortly
after
the
dieselgate
scandal
broke
in
september
vw
hired
law
firm
jones
day
and
advisory
firm
deloitte
to
investigate
the
issue
and
look
at
who
was
responsible
vw
never
published
the
findings
of
the
jones
day
investigation
although
a
summary
was
compiled
in
the
form
of
a
statement
of
facts
for
the
department
of
justice
prosecutors
searched
the
munich
offices
of
jones
day
in
march
in
connection
with
a
fraud
probe
related
to
litre
diesel
engines
made
by
vw
s
premium
unit
audi
vw
fought
the
use
of
any
files
taken
in
the
raid
and
the
constitutional
court
last
july
issued
a
temporary
order
blocking
munich
prosecutors
from
assessing
the
material
the
dismissal
of
vw
s
legal
challenge
by
the
federal
constitutional
court
on
friday
is
a
further
blow
to
vw
which
is
still
grappling
with
the
implications
of
the
dieselgate
scandal
almost
three
years
after
it
came
to
light
munich
state
prosecutors
said
it
was
not
yet
clear
when
they
would
start
to
examine
the
seized
folders
and
computer
data
but
that
they
hoped
they
would
make
their
investigations
easier
volkswagen
shares
were
down
percent
at
gmt
slightly
underperforming
the
dax
index
of
leading
german
shares
the
ruling
comes
just
weeks
after
vw
was
fined
billion
euros
billion
over
emissions
cheating
one
of
the
highest
fines
ever
imposed
on
a
company
by
german
authorities
munich
prosecutors
have
also
widened
a
probe
into
vw
s
luxury
brand
audi
to
include
now
suspended
chief
executive
rupert
stadler
among
the
suspects
accused
of
fraud
and
false
advertising
lawyers
enjoy
some
protection
from
raids
in
germany
but
the
court
on
friday
said
that
the
seizure
of
the
jones
day
documents
did
not
infringe
on
vw
s
right
to
a
fair
legal
process
it
said
that
as
a
firm
jones
day
could
not
ask
for
protection
of
the
german
constitution
and
that
the
lawyers
themselves
who
had
complained
were
not
personally
affected
the
court
also
said
that
there
was
a
risk
of
abuse
should
lawyers
be
protected
from
raids
in
anything
other
than
special
circumstances
because
evidence
could
be
purposefully
stored
with
lawyers
or
only
selectively
published
vw
said
it
welcomed
the
fact
that
the
court
s
decision
brought
some
clarity
on
the
issue
even
if
the
court
disagreed
with
the
carmaker
the
statement
of
facts
published
as
part
of
a
billion
settlement
with
authorities
detailed
a
concerted
effort
by
certain
vw
employees
to
destroy
documents
in
anticipation
of
an
order
to
preserve
them
the
investigations
singled
out
six
senior
managers
below
board
level
an
attorney
and
other
vw
employees
vw
has
argued
that
the
development
of
illegal
software
also
known
as
defeat
devices
was
the
work
of
employees
and
that
no
management
board
members
were
involved
prosecutors
have
challenged
this
by
indicting
vw
s
former
ceo
martin
winterkorn
last
month
munich
prosecutors
arrested
audi
ceo
stadler
though
he
has
not
been
charged
with
any
crime
