and
gas

after
submitting
an
offer
worth
well
in
excess
of
billion
billion
people
familiar
with
the
matter
said
on
friday
the
move
represents
a
big
bet
by
bp
on
oil
and
gas
production
at
a
time
when
energy
prices
are
rebounding
it
would
allow
it
to
significantly
rebalance
its
business
with
oil
production
after
focusing
largely
on
natural
gas
assets
bp
is
the
in
the
auction
for
the
assets
run
by
bhp
and
could
reach
a
deal
in
coming
weeks
the

added
cautioning
that
an
agreement
is
not
certain
and
it
is
possible
that
negotiations
could
end
unsuccessfully
the
exact
terms
and
composition
of
bp
s
offer
could
not
be
learned
the
sources
asked
not
to

because
the
matter
is
confidential
bp
and
bhp
did
not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for
comment
bhp
said
in
august
it
aimed
to
sell
onshore
shale
assets
in
the
eagle
ford
permian
haynesville
and
fayetteville
basins
which
it
acquired
at
the
height
of
the
oil
boom
it
had
come
under
pressure
from
activist
hedge
fund
elliott
management
corp
to
do
so
the
acreage
for
sale
includes
holdings
that
bhp
acquired
in
its
takeover
of
petrohawk
energy
in
which
have
declined
rapidly
in
value
as
the
price
of
natural
gas
has
fallen
from
at
the
time
of
the
deal
to
a
low
of
last
year
in
bp
began
operating
its
onshore
business
as
a
separate
entity
to
make
it
more
competitive
since
then
bp
has
expanded
the
business
to
include
acreage
in
the
haynesville
and
bossier
shale
plays
near
the
border
however
bp
s
expansion
in
shale
fell
behind
many
of
it
peers
when
others
were
building
out
their
presence
onshore
bp
s
focus
was
on
the
aftermath
of
the
deepwater
horizon
disaster
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
which
has
forced
it
to
pay
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
in
damages
and
restitution
since
if
completed
the
acquisition
of
bhp
s
acreage
would
be
transformational
for
bp
s
unit
adding
wells
in
the
permian
and
eagle
ford
basins
of
texas
other
oil
majors
that
participated
in
the
auction
for
the
assets
include
royal
dutch
shell
plc
and
chevron
corp
