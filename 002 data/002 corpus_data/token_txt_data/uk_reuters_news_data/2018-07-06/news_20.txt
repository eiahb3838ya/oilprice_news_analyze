vineyard
in
the
centre
of
belgium
enjoying
the
fruits
of
climate
change
rising
temperatures
are
boosting
the
wine
trade
in
europe
northern
climbs
production
has
quadrupled
in
belgium
since
according
to
government
figures
the
amount
of
land
given
over
to
grapes
there
has
risen
even
faster
for
more
information
see
but
as
well
as
the
volume
there
s
the
taste
twenty
years
ago
we
had
wines
that
had
tastes
of
citrus
lemon
and
a
bit
grapefruit
today
we
have
wines
that
are
closer
to
exotic
products
lychee
pineapple
this
is
a
notable
evolution
rigo
of
the
domaine
de
mellemont
winery
tells
reuters
we
had
much
lighter
wines
years
ago
today
we
have
wines
that
are
fatter
with
a
longer
finish
and
a
much
longer
twelve
years
ago
vines
covered
just
hectares
square
miles
of
belgium
a
country
better
known
for
its
beers
data
from
belgium
s
economy
ministry
show
last
year
that
area
had
expanded
almost
to
cover
hectares
still
miniscule
compared
to
neighbouring
france
but
a
start
it
is
part
of
a
clear
pattern
according
to
wim
thiery
a
climate
scientist
at
vub
university
in
brussels
we
do
clearly
see
a
shift
where
regions
in
the
mediterranean
which
are
currently
suitable
for
viticulture
will
no
longer
be
suitable
in
the
future
or
less
and
less
suitable
he
said
instead
regions
in
northern
europe
such
as
belgium
will
become
suitable
in
the
future
for
vineyards
and
for
wine
there
are
downsides
climate
change
has
generally
made
weather
more
erratic
which
can
hurt
vineyards
says
thiery
but
most
of
the
changes
have
been
more
gradual
production
has
climbed
tastes
have
evolved
and
the
harvests
have
edged
earlier
at
domaine
de
mellemont
km
miles
southwest
of
brussels
workers
there
used
to
call
one
of
their
picking
seasons
the
all
saints
harvest
because
of
its
closeness
to
the
festival
at
the
end
of
october
this
year
we
re
planning
on
harvesting
our
grapes
around
late
september
or
early
october
says
rigo
when
it
comes
to
the
changes
he
has
seen
in
the
last
few
years
he
is
happy
to
focus
on
the
positive
belgian
wine
is
very
young
it
is
still
in
its
adolescence
when
it
comes
to
grape
variety
terroir
in
the
coming
years
i
think
we
will
discover
some
