ukraine
s
oil
and
gas
firm
naftogaz
said
on
friday
it
had
submitted
a
claim
to
the
stockholm
arbitration
court
for
more
than
billion
from
russian
gas
giant
gazprom
related
to
a
transit
contract
the
move
ramps
up
a
legal
dispute
between
the
two
countries
that
has
run
alongside
ukraine
s
broader
political
with
russia
naftogaz
said
that
due
to
changes
in
the
european
gas
market
it
had
sought
in
march
to
renegotiate
the
tariff
it
receives
from
gazprom
for
transit
of
gas
to
europe
across
ukrainian
territory
gazprom
has
not
been
constructive
in
the
negotiations
compelling
naftogaz
to
refer
the
matter
to
arbitration
as
provided
for
in
the
contract
naftogaz
said
in
a
statement
it
gave
a
preliminarily
estimate
of
the
value
of
the
claim
at
billion
in
february
the
stockholm
court
ordered
gazprom
to
pay
more
than
billion
to
naftogaz
over
a
different
contractual
dispute
the
decision
was
meant
to
conclude
a
long
legal
battle
but
naftogaz
says
gazprom
has
not
complied
with
the
ruling
ukraine
and
russia
have
had
a
complex
dispute
over
gas
issues
for
years
which
blew
up
when
the
two
countries
became
enemies
after
a
leader
of
ukraine
was
toppled
in
last
year
gazprom
supplied
a
record
high
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
of
gas
to
europe
excluding
former
soviet
states
and
turkey
transit
of

gas
via
ukraine
jumped
