asian
stocks
wobbled
on
friday
as
washington
slapped
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
a
move
many
investors
fear
could
be
the
start
of
a
trade
war
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
the
tariffs
on
more
than
goods
from
china
worth
billion
took
effect
at
gmt
president
donald
trump
has
warned
the
united
states
may
ultimately
target
over
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
an
amount
that
roughly
matches
its
total
imports
from
china
last
year
china
s
commerce
ministry
said
shortly
after
the
tariffs
took
effect
that
it
was
forced
to
retaliate
meaning
billion
worth
of
imported
goods
including
autos
and
agricultural
products
are
also
subject
to
percent
tariffs
msci
s
broadest
index
of

outside
japan
was
percent
lower
pulling
back
from
a
modest
early
rise
the

has
lost
near
percent
since
june
the
shanghai
composite
index
ended
morning
trade
down
percent
before
the
tariffs
took
effect
and
trading
will
resume
at
gmt
earlier
on
friday
the
index
fell
as
much
as
percent
to
getting
close
to
its
january
low
of
china
will
surely
take
retaliatory
steps
to
which
president
donald
trump
has
threatened
more
tariffs
said
norihiro
fujito
senior
investment
strategist
at
mitsubishi
ufj
morgan
stanley
securities
a
trade
war
now
has
become
a
reality
he
said
if
this
was
a
boxing
match
the
first
round
has
just
begun
it
is
going
to
be
a
long
process
trump
is
unlikely
to
back
down
easily
ahead
of
the
elections
in
november
especially
given
the
recent
rise
in
his
popularity
fujito
said
seoul

helped
in
part
by
a
boost
in
automaker
shares
on
signs
washington
and
the
european
union
may
be
seeking
a
compromise
on
tariffs
on
cars
how
that
s
going
to
iron
out
i
think
that
s
still
going
to
be
a
major
point
of
contention
but
at
least
they
re
talking
and
i
think
while
cooler
heads
prevail
that

the
positivity
that

emanated
from
the
