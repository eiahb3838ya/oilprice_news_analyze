asian
stocks
bounced
back
from
lows
in
volatile
trade
on
friday
after
washington
slapped
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
a
move
many
investors
fear
could
be
the
start
of
a
trade
war
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
forecast
a
rise

mainland
chinese
shares
led
asia
s
recovery
partly
helped
by
the
perception
that
the
tariff
measures
were
already
priced
in
to
be
sure
there
was
some
trepidation
about
what
lay
ahead
the
relationship
is
such
a
large
component
of
global
trade
that
we
really
have
a
global
impact
and
that
has
implications
that
are
difficult
to
foresee
said
frederic
neumann
of
asia
economic
research
at
hsbc
in
hong
kong
but
he
also
said
he
was
fairly
relaxed
about
the
tariffs
and
trade
dispute
it
s
a
drag
on
growth
i
don
t
think
it
s
as
disruptive
as
often
described
neuman
said
china
s
position
is
strong
enough
to
avoid
a
hard
landing
in
the
current
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
which
dropped
percent
early
in
the
day
had
gained

by
the
shanghai
composite
index
was
up
percent
in
the
morning
it
fell
percent
to
within
sight
of
a
january
low
of
then
later
it
was
more
than
percent
up
japan
s
nikkei
stock
index
rose
percent
recovering
from
thursday
s
low
the
tariffs
on
more
than
goods
from
china
worth
billion
took
effect
at
gmt
but
its
quiet
start
prompted
by
those
who
had
feared
for
fresh
retaliatory
measures
china
s
commerce
ministry
said
in
a
statement
shortly
after
the
deadline
passed
that
it
was
forced
to
retaliate
meaning
billion
worth
of
imported
goods
including
autos
and
agricultural
products
also
faced
percent
tariffs
many
economists
say
the
direct
impact
of
the
tariffs
would
be
contained
given
the
current
strength
of
the
global
economy
but
investors
remained
wary
when
economists
run
various
economic
models
they
get
estimates
that
it
will
slash
gdp
only
by
percentage
point
said
kozo
koide
chief
economist
in
tokyo
for
asset
management
one
that
would
be
true
if
this
tariffs
would
be
imposed
only
for
a
year
but
you
don
t
know
how
long
this
will
continue
such
uncertainties
will
surely
affect
companies
spending
and
hiring
plans
markets
are
worried
the
economy
may
lose
momentum
earlier
than
previously
thought
he
added
president
donald
trump
has
warned
the
united
states
may
ultimately
target
over
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
an
amount
that
roughly
matches
its
total

from
china
