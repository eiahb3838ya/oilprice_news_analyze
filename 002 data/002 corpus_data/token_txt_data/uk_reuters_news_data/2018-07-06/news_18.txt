mainly
with
the
support
of
the
opposition
even
though
he
is
a
member
of
the
ruling
all
progressives
congress
he
was
not
the
apc
s
preferred
candidate
which
led
to
strains
in
his
relationship
with
president
muhammadu
buhari
this
is
a
politically
motivated
case
saraki
said
in
his
statement
which
did
not
name
buhari
the
case
was
trumped
up
in
the
first
instance
because

my
emergence
as
the

wishes
of
certain
a

saraki
s
battles
with
the
presidency
are
not
the
only
fractures
to
have
emerged

on
thursday
a
faction
of

split
declaring
that
it
no
longer
supported
the
