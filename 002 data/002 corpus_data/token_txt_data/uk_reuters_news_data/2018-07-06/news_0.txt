reuters
oil
was
mixed
on
friday
as
a
canadian
supply
outage
supported
crude
prices
while
an
increase
in
production
from
opec
s
biggest
exporter
saudi
arabia
pushed
brent
lower
crude
futures
gained
cents
or
percent
to
settle
at
a
barrel
global
benchmark
brent
slipped
cents
to
settle
at
a
barrel
for
the
week
wti
futures
lost
about
percent
after
hitting
a
high
on
tuesday
while
brent
lost
about
percent
crude
was
bullish
after
official
data
on
thursday
showed
inventories
at
cushing
the
delivery
point
for
crude
futures
fell
to
their
lowest
in
years
that
came
after
an
outage
at
a
major
canadian
oil
sands
facility
cut
regional
supply
the
outage
at
the
barrels
per
day
bpd
syncrude
facility
in
canada
has
contributed
to
a
sharp
reduction
in
the
discount
for
crude
versus
brent
crude
over
the
past
month
the
discount
has
halved
to
a
barrel
on
friday
from
in
early
june
we
re
continuing
to
see
and
i
expect
the
trend
will
continue
lower
inventories
in
cushing
in
july
resulting
in
a
very
tight
light
sweet
crude
market
said
andrew
lipow
president
of
lipow
associates
that
has
been
exacerbated
by
the
canadian
syncrude
outage
which
has
resulted
in
a
scramble
for
supplies
in
the
midwest
i
do
expect
that
at
least
over
the
next
few
weeks
the
spread
is
going
to
brent
was
being
pressured
by
expectations
for
higher
saudi
and
russia
production
which
impacts
europe
and
asia
where
brent
is
the
benchmark
more
than
markets
dominated
by
crude
prices
saudi
arabia
told
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
that
it
increased
production
by
almost
barrels
per
day
last
month
opec
and
its
allies
agreed
earlier
this
month
to
a
modest
increase
in
output
to
dampen
the
oil
price
rally
which
hit
a
year
high
the
supply
increase
reversed
some
of
the
cuts
that
opec
and
other
major
producers
put
in
place
in
early
to
end
several
years
of
supply
glut
saudi
arabia
also
said
it
would
reduce
the
official
selling
price
of
its
august
barrels
markets
also
garnered
support
from
a
government
employment
report
showing
growth
in
jobs
that
blunted
the
impact
of
an
escalating
trade
war
we
re
seeing
a
bounce
to
the
upside
thanks
to
spillover
from
a
really
good
jobs
number
and
strength
in
equity
markets
as
well
as
a
draw
in
cushing
stocks
said
jim
ritterbusch
president
of
ritterbusch
and
associates
the
trade
war
has
yet
to
have
a
direct
impact
on
oil
markets
but
china
has
indicated
it
could
place
tariffs
on
crude
imports
if
that
happens
chinese
demand
would
then
shift
to
other
suppliers
because
the
oil
market
is
already
in
tight
supply
due
to
the
numerous
outages
this
would
drive
international
prices
brent
further
up
commerzbank
said
in
a
note
producers
continued
to
bring
more
rigs
into
oilfields
already
producing
at
record
levels
the
rig
count
an
early
indicator
of
future
output
was
up
by
five
in
the
week
to
july
according
to
general
electric
co
s
baker
hughes
energy
services
firm
that
brings
the
total
count
to
up
from
last
year
