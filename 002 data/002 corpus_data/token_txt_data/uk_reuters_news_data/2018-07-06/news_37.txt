france
said
on
friday
it
was
unlikely
european
powers
would
be
able
to
put
together
an
economic
package
for
iran
that
would
salvage
its
nuclear
deal
before
november
and
warned
tehran
to
stop
threatening
to
break
its
commitments
to
the
accord
they
must
stop
permanently
threatening
to
break
their
commitments
to
the
nuclear
deal
french
foreign

drian
told

before
travelling

for
a
ministerial
meeting
on
the
agreement
they
must
stop
the
threats
so
that
we
can
find
the
solutions
so
that
iran
can
have
the
necessary
economic
he
said
the
european
powers
but
also
russia
and
china
were
working
on
coming
up
with
a
financial
mechanism
to
mitigate
planned
tough
sanctions
we
are
trying
to
do
it
before
sanctions
are
imposed
at
the
start
of
august
and
then
another
set
of
sanctions
in
november
for
the
start
august
it
seems
a
bit
short
but
we

do
it
by
