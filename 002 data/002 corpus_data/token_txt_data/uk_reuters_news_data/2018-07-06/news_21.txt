for
the

seen
limited
scope
for
salvaging
it
trump
pulled
the
united

out
of
the
multinational

under
which
sanctions
on
iran
were

policy
chief
federica
mogherini
who
chaired
the
talks
read
a
statement
from
the
six
delegations
repeating
broad
priorities
ranging
from
guaranteeing
iranian
oil
revenue
to
shipping
ties
banking
and
all
other
trade
and
investment
participants
agreed
to
keep
progress
under
close
review
and
to
reconvene
the
joint
commission
including
at
ministerial
level
as
appropriate
in
order
to
advance
common
efforts
mogherini
said
adding
that
all
sides
were
determined
to
find
and
implement
solutions
unlike
at
past
meetings
mogherini
took
no
questions
all
the
commitments
made
today
should
be
implemented
before
the
august
deadline
it
is
up
to
the
leadership
in
tehran
to
decide
whether
iran
should
remain
in
the
deal
the
proposal
was
not
precise
and
a
complete
one
mohammed
javad
zarif
told
reporters
speaking
earlier
in
the
day
france
s
foreign
minister
said
that
world
powers
would
struggle
to
keep
to
that
deadline
they
iran
must
stop
threatening
to
break
their
commitments
to
the
nuclear
deal
le
drian
said
we
are
trying
to
do
it
economic
package
before
sanctions
are
imposed
at
the
start
of
august
and
then
the
next
set
of
sanctions
in
november
for
august
it
seems
a
bit
short
but
we
are
trying
to
do
it
by
november
he
said
on
arrival
in
vienna
germany
s
foreign
minister
heiko
mass
said
he
didn
t
expect
a
collapse
of
talks
but
suggested
more
negotiations
would
be
needed
in
the
future
he
stressed
hat
world
powers
would
struggle
to
compensate
tehran
for
companies
leaving
iran
the
pillars
of
the
european
union
s
strategy
are
european
investment
bank
lending
a
special
measure
to
shield
eu
companies
from
secondary
sanctions
and
a
commission
proposal
that
eu
governments
make
direct
money
transfers
to
iran
s
central
bank
to
avoid
penalties
we
ve
made
some
progress
including
on
safeguarding
some
crude
oil
sales
but
it
s
unlikely
to
meet
iranian
expectations
it
s
also
not
just
about
what
the
europeans
can
do
but
also
how
the
chinese
russians
indians
others
can
contribute
said
a
senior
european
diplomat
iranian
officials
have
said
that
key
for
them
is
to
ensure
measures
that
guarantee
oil
exports
do
not
halt
and
that
tehran
still
has
access
to
the
swift
international
bank
payments
messaging
system
or
an
alternative
we
are
ready
for
all
possible
scenarios
the
collapse
of
the
deal
will
increase
the
tension
in
the
region
to
save
the
deal
other
signatories
should
compensate
for
sanctions
a
senior
iranian
official
told
reuters
on
friday
during
a
visit
to
europe
this
week
president
hassan
rouhani
warned
that
iran
could
reduce
its

the
nuclear
watchdog
having
already
threatened
trump
of
the
consequences
of
fresh
sanctions
against
iranian
oil
sales
iran
s
revolutionary
guards
have
also
warned
that
they
may
block
oil
shipments
through
the
strait
of
hormuz
in
response
to
calls
to
ban
all
iranian
oil
exports
on
the
nuclear
side
of
the
agreement
the
parties
did
agree
to
replace
the
united
states
in
a
working
group
to
redesign
the
arak
reactor
with
china
the
deal
specifies
that
the
new
design
will
aim
to
minimise
the
production
of
plutonium
and
to
prevent
the
production
of
plutonium
in
normal
operation
it
also
specifies
the
fuel
arak
must
use
and
says
its
spent

for
the
reactor

lifetime
must
be
