has
announced
the

on

are

on

china
has
said
it
would
immediately
retaliate
with
its
own
tariffs
and
president
trump
said
on
thursday
the
united
states
may
ultimately
impose
tariffs
on
more
than
a
dollars
worth
of
chinese
goods
in
what
may
become
a
fully
blown
trade
war
things
will
get
worse
before
they
get
better
on
trade
between
the
and
china
said
greg
mckenna
chief
market
strategist
at
futures
brokerage
axitrader
beijing
has
said
it
may
include
a
percent
tariff
on
crude
oil
imports
although
it
has
not
specified
a
date
on
which
it
would
include
that
duty
american
crude
shipments
to
china
currently
stand
around
barrels
per
day
bpd
worth
around
billion
a
month
at
current
market
prices
a
chinese
import
tariff
would
make
oil
uncompetitive
in
china
forcing
its
refiners
to
seek
alternative
supplies
elsewhere
that
would
happen
in
a
global
oil
market
that
has
steadily
tightened
this
year
energy
consultancy
fge
this
week
issued
a
stark
warning
of
looming
supply
shortages
due
to
sanctions
against
iran
and
also
because
of
disruptions
elsewhere
iran
s
exports
are
some
million
bpd
including
condensate
it
noted
fge
said
the
government
may
grant
some
waivers
to
allies
that
are
particularly
reliant
on
iranian
supplies
and
that
some
iranian
oil
would
also
be
smuggled
into
global
markets
it
estimated
that
once
sanctions
are
fully
implemented
some
to
million
bpd
of
crude
and
condensate
would
be
taken
out
of
the
market
at
the
same
time
venezuela
can
do
nothing
to
stop
its
own
production
decline
and
will
lose
another
bpd
by
with
production
going
to
below
million
bpd
fge
said
adding
that
another
bpd
of
libyan
capacity
was
disrupted
although
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
both
said
they
would
raise
output
to
make
up
for
these
disruptions
fge
said
there
simply
is
not
enough
capacity
to
make
up
for
iran
s
crude
losses
plus
venezuela
and
libya
and
warned
of
the
possibility
of
oil
prices
rising
to
per
barrel
