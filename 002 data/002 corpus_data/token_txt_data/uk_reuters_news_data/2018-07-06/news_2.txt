a
spell

led
kansai
electric
to
buy
this
week
but
demand
for
august
and
september
was
still
limited
there
though
chinese
consumption
was
brisk
in
part
driven
by
new
government
policy
mandating
that
domestic
importers
boost
storage
capacity
new

pakistan
lng
received
offers
from
vitol

but
a
sharp
downturn
in

subsequently
means
spot

are
now
closer

in

terms
the
prospect
of
paying
such
steep
premiums
as
monsoon

lowered
cooling
demand
led
pakistan
to
cancel
its

a
promising
outlet
for

could
be

saw

but
remained
robust
and
in
certain

such
as

it
suggests
further

availability
