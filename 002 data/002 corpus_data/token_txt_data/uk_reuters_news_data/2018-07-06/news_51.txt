environmental
protection
agency
chief
scott
pruitt
who
had
been
lauded
by
president
donald
trump
for
his
aggressive
efforts
to
roll
back
environmental
regulations
resigned
on
thursday
under
heavy
fire
for
a
series
of
controversies
pruitt
was
one
of
trump
s
most
polarizing
cabinet
members
slashing
regulations
on
the
energy
and
manufacturing
industries
including
a
move
to
repeal
president
barack
obama
s
signature
program
to
cut
carbon
emissions
from
power
plants
dubbed
the
clean
power
plan

was
also
instrumental
last
year
in
lobbying
trump
to
withdraw
the
united
states
from
the
global
paris
climate
accord
to
combat
global
warming
but
pruitt
lost
favor
with
trump
s
inner
circle
after
a
string
of
controversies
including
travel
at
taxpayer
expense
lavish
spending
on
security
the
installation
of
a
soundproof
phone
booth
in
his
office
and
accusations
that
he
used
his
position
to
receive
favors
such
as
a
discounted
rental
on
a
condo
from
an
energy
lobbyist
s
wife
the
unrelenting
attacks
on
me
personally
my
family
are
unprecedented
and
have
taken
a
sizable
toll
on
all
of
us
pruitt
said
in
his
resignation
letter
trump
announced
the
resignation
on
twitter
and
said
epa
deputy
administrator
andrew
wheeler
a
former
mining
industry
lobbyist
will
become
the
regulatory
agency
s
acting
chief
on
monday
wheeler
is
widely
expected
to
continue
pruitt
s
efforts
to
roll
back
and
streamline
regulation
something
that
trump
had
promised
in
his
presidential
campaign
scott
has
done
an
outstanding
job
and
i
will
always
be
thankful
to
him
for
this
trump
wrote
trump
told
reporters
later
that
pruitt
had
approached
him
and
offered
to
resign
as
opposed
to
being
pushed
out
wheeler
said
in
a
message
to
epa
employees
that
he
was
both
humbled
and
honored
to
lead
the
agency
i
look
forward
to
working
hard
alongside
all
of
you
to
continue
our
collective
goal
of
protecting
public
health
and
the

behalf
of
the

scott
pruitt
s
reign
of
venality
is
finally
over
he
made
swamp
creatures
blush
with
his
shameless
excesses
all
tolerated
because
trump
liked
his
zealotry
shame
democratic
representative
gerry
connolly
said
the
environmental
working
group
a
public

and
environment
watchdog
called
pruitt
unquestionably
the
worst
head
of
the
agency

heading
up
the
epa
had
sued
the
federal
agency
more
than
a
dozen
times
on
behalf
of
his
state
pruitt
also
rankled
some
republican
lawmakers
including
in
midwest
states
with
his
efforts
to
overhaul
a
policy
requiring
biofuels
like
ethanol
in
gasoline

that
pruitt
had
been
a
good
friend

legislation
matt
dempsey
an
energy
lobbyist
at
consultancy
fti
said
wheeler
will
be
less
controversial
than
pruitt
but
without
altering
the
agenda
he
will
be
less
political
and
more
straightforward
in
his
approach
to
the
job
which
is
better
for
the
trump
administration
agenda
in
the
long
run
the
politics
will
pass
but
the
policy
will
remain
dempsey
said
pruitt
was
facing
around
a
dozen
investigations
into
his
tenure
including
his
frequent
use
of
flights
and
his
spending
on
security
which
the
agency
has
defended
as
necessary
to
defend
him
against
unprecedented
threats

spent
in
taxpayer
money
on
a

which
is
not
part
of
the
epa
s
jurisdiction
the
washington

reported
that
a
longtime
pruitt
friend
and
lobbyist
helped
arrange
the
trip
and
later
registered
as
a
foreign
agent
representing
morocco
in
one
of
the
investigations
the
government
accountability
office
concluded
that
the
epa
violated
two
laws
by
installing
the
phone
booth
for
pruitt
s
office
without
telling
lawmakers
first
pruitt
said
his
staff
never
told
him
the
cost
some
of
the
ethics
accusations
against
pruitt
also
involved
jobs
for
his
wife
emails

by
the

environmental
group
showed
pruitt
had
an
aide
contact
the
chief
executive
of
a
chain
about
his
wife
becoming
a

the

with
a
salary
topping
pruitt
also
had
an

carry
out
his
personal

from
the
trump
international
hotel
according
to
an
interview

a

the
controversy
over
the
search
for
a
used
trump
international
hotel
mattress
was
the
last
straw
for
trump
with
pruitt
because
it
involved
the

congressional
testimony
in
april
pruitt
was
unapologetic
for
the
controversies
often
blaming
