at
the

repeatedly
policymakers
are
pushing

said
this
week
it
would
not
reinsure
any
company

represents
more
than
percent
of
its
business
it
follows
french
peer
scor
which
last
year
said
it
would
stop
underwriting
new
thermal

mines
while
not
enough
for
some
campaigners
the
moves
are
seen
forcing
smaller
insurers
to
reconsider
underwriting
companies
involved
in
coal
production
reinsurers
help
insurers
share
the
burden
of
large

said
it
did
not
plan
to
copy
swiss
re
in
limiting
its
underwriting
of
coal
companies
munich
re
will
continue

insure
all
types
of
companies
taking
into
account
an
assessment
of
all
risk
aspects
including
environmental
social
and
governance

criteria
a

told

that

could
become
increasingly
untenable
though
as

seek
more

told

from
a

a
munich
re
investor
we
haven
t
seen
any
strict
policy
yet
is
it

re
said
the
swiss
re
move
was
significant
and
while
others
were
not
moving
quickly
enough
they
would
also
be
pushed
by
investors
not
only
us
but
the
entire
industry

citing
plans
by
the
european

investors
and

say
changing
underwriting
behaviour
is
crucial
to
encourage
a
transition
away
from
coal
the
biggest
emitter
of
carbon
no
firm
has
yet
opted
to
stop
insuring
the

completely
though
as
increased
climate
change
risk
can
lead
to
higher
premiums
and
coal
demand
remains
strong
