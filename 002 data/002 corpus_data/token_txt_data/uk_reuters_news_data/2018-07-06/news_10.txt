roughly
the

all
imports
from
china
in
what
could
beijing
do
to
ease
the
impact
on
its
economy
in
theory
it
could
ease
policy
it
has
also
subtly
hinted
at
using
yuan
depreciation
as
a
retaliatory
tool
by
allowing
the
currency
to
post
its
biggest
monthly
loss
on
record
in
june
though
capital
outflows
are
a
risk
upcoming
data
will
provide
a
crucial
insight
into
china
s
economy
the
weekend
brings
the
latest
fx
reserves
picture
consumer

factory
inflation
figures
emerge
on
july
trade

and
beyond
china
economic
growth
seen
slowing
as
trade
war
looms
the
words
you
long
to
hear
the
fed
is
pressing
ahead
with
raising
interest
rates
global
financial
conditions
are
tightening
and
investors
are
nervous
about
the
global
economy
emerging
markets
are
under
the
cosh
and
bond
yield
curves
are
flattening
the
yield
curve
is
less
than
basis
points
from
inversion
the
signal
that
recession
is
coming
this
is
the
backdrop
to
a
series
of
speeches
next
week
from
some
of
the
world
s
most
powerful
central
bankers
bank
of
japan
governor
kuroda
european
central
bank
chief
draghi
bank
of
england
boss
carney
and
bank
of
canada
s
poloz
all
take
the
stand
the
boc
will
likely
also
raise
interest
rates
next
week
here
s
the
balance
they
will
try
to
strike
signal
an
exit
from
stimulus
but
not
so
fast
that
growth
and
investor
confidence
will
plummet
it
won
t
be
easy
as
it
stands
the
current
economic
expansion
and
bull
market
are
very
long
in
the
tooth
fed
tightening

could
be
enough
to
end
them
both
fed
can
puncture
global
growth

more

are
part
of
the
reason
thanks
to
tailwinds
earnings
growth
clocked
in
at
percent
and
the
second
quarter
starting
next
week
should
moderate
only
slightly
to
percent
however
the
season
is
being
clouded
by
trade
tensions
and
their
impact
on
corporate
profits
so
analysts
will
closely
scrutinise
outlook
statements
to
see
whether
to
adjust
numbers
for
the
rest
of
right
now

at

same
time
british

merkel

visit
is
part
of
a
western

summit
where
ironically
the
main
agenda
is
eu

but
she
will
make
time
for
a
brexit
powwow
with

and
it

not

politics
on

britain

threats
coming
days
may
being
more
volatility
to
oil
markets
too
they
have
already
been
on
a
rollercoaster
rising
almost
to
per
barrel
after
output
cuts
by
the
organization
of
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
allies
opec
has
agreed
to
ease
output
curbs
but
prices
are
receiving
fresh
impetus
from
washington
s
new
sanctions
against
tehran
those
in
turn
have
led
iran
s
revolutionary
guards
to
threaten
a
blockade
of
the
strait
of
hormuz
the
world

most
important
oil
artery
through

consumption
passes
tensions
are
running
high

navigation
through

high
oil
prices
are
wiping
out
any
benefits
the
economy
might
enjoy
from
trump
s
tax
cuts
but
while
he
has
lashed
out
at
the
cartel
and
urged
it
to
raise
production
he
is
also
pressuring
governments
to
stop
iranian
purchases
such
rhetoric
may
push
oil
prices
higher
still
as
will
any
outbreak
of
hostilities
in

trump
is
pressing
