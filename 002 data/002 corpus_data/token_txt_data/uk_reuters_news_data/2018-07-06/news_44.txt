pakistan
state
oil
pso
has
reduced
its
fuel
oil
imports
for
power
generation
as
monsoon
rains
have
lowered
the
demand
for
electricity
for
cooling
contributing
to
a
decline
in
fuel
oil
premiums
from
the
highs
reached
last
week
since
may
pso
has
sought
to
import
as
much
as
tonnes
of
fuel
oil
per
month
the
increased
demand
pushed
fuel
oil
premiums
higher
since
it
occurred
at
the
same
time
supplies
typically
become
tighter
during
the
northern
hemisphere
summer
when
fuel
oil
consumption
for
power
generation
rises
particularly
in
the
middle
east
pso
has
not
awarded
tenders
seeking
fuel
oil
for
and
delivery
after
receiving
offers
from
suppliers
said
four
trade
sources
the
company
last
imported
fuel
oil
for
delivery
from
june
to
the
sources
said
pso
still
has
outstanding
tenders
for
imports
for
delivery
from
the
end
of
july
to
september
according
to
the
tender
documents
pso
did
not
respond
to
a
request
from
reuters
for
comment
the
country
has
enough
stock
and
they
have
local
fuel
oil
production
and
monsoon
has
already
started
with
some
places
getting
a
lot
of
rain
so
temperature
has
cooled
down
said
one
of
the
sources
a
trader
at
a
company
that
typically
supplies
pso
with
fuel
oil
the
trader
declined
to
be
identified
as
he
is
not
authorised
to
speak
to
the
media
increased
monsoon
rainfall
in
the
country
has
also
helped
boost
hydroelectric
power
generation
lowering
the
demand
for
fuel
oil
for
electricity
the
trade
sources
said
pakistan
this
week
saw
its
heaviest
rains
in
years
pakistan
s
lower
fuel
oil
demand
may
have
contributed
to
weakness
in
asia
s
fuel
oil
market
this
week
the
four
trade
sources
said
premiums
have
retreated
from
recent
highs
reached
in
the
previous
week
amid
shortages
of
supply
and
strong
demand
i
personally
wouldn
t
expect
they
import
anything
during
this
year
a
cargo
or
two
might
surprise
but
not
more
than
that
the
trader
said
the
lower
fuel
oil
imports
are
occurring
as
pakistan
lng
cancelled
a
tender
seeking
six
cargoes
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
for
delivery
in
july
and
august
two
industry
sources
said
on
wednesday
the
country
s
lng
imports
are
mainly
used
for
power
generation
pso
in
december
halted
fuel
oil
imports
as
pakistan
ramped
up
its
lng
consumption
for
its
power
sector
but
strong
seasonal
demand
for
electricity
in
the
summer
months
and
technical
issues
at
some
of
its
newest
power
plants
renewed
the
country
s
appetite
for
fuel
oil
