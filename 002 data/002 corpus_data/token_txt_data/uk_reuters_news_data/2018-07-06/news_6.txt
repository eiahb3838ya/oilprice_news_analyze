new

reuters
corn
farmers
and
biofuels
producers
cheered
the
resignation
of
environmental
protection
agency
chief
scott
pruitt
in
the
hope
that
his
successor
may
give
them
more
access
and
fewer
threats
to
reducing
domestic
requirements
pruitt
led
president
donald
trump
s
aggressive
efforts
to
roll
back
environmental
protections
he
drew
the
ire
of
farmers
and
antagonized
their
powerful
lobby
in
washington
when
he
relaxed
enforcement
of
a
mandate
to
include
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
made
from
grains
in
the
country
s
gasoline
and
diesel
supply
biofuels
are
an
important
source
of
demand
for
corn
pruitt
resigned
on
thursday
after
heavy
criticism
in
congress
for
controversies
his
temporary
replacement
is
deputy
administrator
andrew
wheeler
a
former
senate
staffer
and
lobbyist
who
had
done
a
stint
at
the
epa
earlier
in
his
career
he
is
a
washington
insider
with
connections
to
oil
coal
and
biofuels
wheeler
is
best
known
for
his
work
with
coal
firms
such
as
murray
energy
he
has
also
consulted
for
biofuels
association
growth
energy
and
agricultural
merchant
and
biofuels
producer
archer
daniels
midland
co
according
to
his
public
financial
disclosures
he
takes
the
helm
at
a
time
of
uncertainty
over
the
agency
s
approach
to
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
a
law
that
requires
greater
use
of
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
in
the
nation
s
fuel
midwest
farmers
and
their
representatives
say
pruitt
weakened
the
rfs
by
trying
to
lower
the
costs
of
compliance
for
oil
refiners
wheeler
may
pursue
some
of
the
similar
goals
biofuels
groups
say
but
they
believe
he
will
be
more
transparent
and
not
color
outside
the
lines
as
they
claim
pruitt
did
it
is
unclear
exactly
what
wheeler
s
plans
are
for
the
rfs
but
during
a
senate
hearing
in
november
he
said
in
response
to
questioning
that
he
respected
the
program
as
the
law
of
the
no
one
can
bank
on
the
outcome
but
a
fair
process
is
bankable
with
andy
wheeler
brooke
coleman
head
of
the
advanced
biofuels
business
council
said
on
friday
wheeler
is
more
of
a
pragmatist
and
likely
to
pay
more
heed
to
the
way
things
are
typically
done
in
washington
said
michael
mcadams
head
of
the
advanced
biofuels
association
the
difference
is
pruitt
had
an
absolute
disdain
for
washington
mcadams
said
pruitt
went
behind
closed
doors
and
took
an
authoritative
position
that
s
not
how
andy
will
biofuels
groups
said
pruitt
s
decisions
on
the
mandate
were
curbing
domestic
ethanol
consumption
under
pruitt
the
epa
issued
mass
waivers
for
small
refineries
from
their
annual
requirements
to
use
biofuels
ethanol
and
farm
groups
have
sued
the
epa
over
the
refinery
exemptions
ongoing
discussions
among
refiners
farm
groups
politicians
and
officials
on
changes
to
the
rfs
have
led
to
a
growing
rift
between
two
of
trumps
constituencies
the
oil
and
farm
lobbies
trump
himself
has
personally
waded
into
the
debate
but
has
been
unable
to
broker
a
deal
that
would
satisfy
both
sides
they
reached
an
impasse
a
month
ago
when
powerful
iowa
republican
senators
grassley
and
joni
ernst
fought
against
some
of
the
changes
being
pushed
by
republican
senator
ted
cruz
from
texas
and
oil
refiners
in
a
tweet
on
thursday
afternoon
ernst
said
i
have
confidence
that
andrew
wheeler
will
be
a
good
partner
at
epa
and
i
look
forward
to
working
with
him
on
the
the
senate
confirmed
wheeler
in
april
with
a
vote
that
went
mostly
along
party
lines
