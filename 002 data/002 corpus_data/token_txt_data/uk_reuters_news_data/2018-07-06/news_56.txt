the

grounds
the
bill
has
stalled
in
the
senate
we
ve
had

the

at

trade
group
independent

it

requesting
the

specialty
steel
used

i
put
millions

exporting
a
heck
of
a

i
m
at
risk
said
marc
levine
chief

of

llc
a
plastics
resin
blender
packager
and
shipper
if
china
goes
ahead
with
tariffs
on
plastics
it
could
have
a
very
clear
negative
effect
on
resin
producers
and
others
here
to
support
the
huge
increase
in
production
railroads
truckers
pallet
manufacturers
and
ocean

levine

chinese
retaliatory
tariffs
on
billion

chemistry
council
if
those
come
into
