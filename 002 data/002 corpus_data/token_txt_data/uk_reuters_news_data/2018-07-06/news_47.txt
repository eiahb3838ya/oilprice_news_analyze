south
korea
will
not
lift
any
iranian
crude
and
condensate
in
july
halting
all
shipments
for
the
first
time
in
six
years
amid
pressure
to
cut
all
imports
of
iranian
oil
from
november
three
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
on
friday
japanese
customers
however
are
continuing
to
import
for
now
with
multiple
buyers
considering
buying
iranian
oil
through
september
loading
said
a
north
asia
trading
source
familiar
with
iranian
oil
shipping
arrangements
the
move
by
south
korea
one
of
iran
s
main
customers
in
asia
along
with
china
and
japan
comes
as
it
is
in
talks
to
seek
an
exemption
from
curbs
on
buying
iranian
oil
in
line
with
a
waiver
it
received
during
previous
sanctions
there
was
pressure
from
the
south
korean
government
to
halt
purchases
said
the
source
familiar
with
iranian
shipping
arrangements
south
korea
overall
is
lifting
zero
oil
from
iran
for
july
two
other
sources
said
south
korea
cancelled
july
loadings
of
crude
and
condensate
cargoes
from
iran
as
it
was
uncertain
whether
the
country
would
receive
an
exemption
from
sanctions
on
iran
trade
the
cancellations
mean
south
korea
will
import
no
iranian
oil
in
august
the
first
month
of
zero
imports
since
august
when
south
korean
buyers
put
iranian
oil
purchases
on
hold
before
getting
a
waiver
to
import
limited
amounts
of
iran
crude
the
united
states
in
may
said
it
was
walking
away
from
an
international
deal
on
iran
s
nuclear
programme
in
late
june
it
demanded
its
allies
halt
all
imports
of
iranian
oil
from
november
and
said
exemptions
were
unlikely
south
korean
refiners
have
since
curtailed
their
iranian
oil
purchases
and
turned
to
alternative
sources
such
as
american
and
african
crude
due
to
expensive
middle
east
grades
and
uncertainty
over
trade
with
iran

which
reduced

were
lifted

also
seeking
an
exemption
from
the
latest
sanctions

japanese
buyers
also
nominated
cargoes
for
august
though
they
were
not
allowed
to
buy
additional
crude
on
top
of

contractual
volumes
the
shipping
source
said
japanese
oil
refiners
may
have
to
stop
loading
iranian
crude
oil
from

the
government
does
not
secure
another
exemption
