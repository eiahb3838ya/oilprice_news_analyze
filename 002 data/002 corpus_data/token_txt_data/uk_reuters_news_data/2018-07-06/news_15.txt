an
oil
refinery
being
built
by
aliko
dangote
will
account
for
half
of
his
conglomerate
s
assets
when
it
is
finished
next
year
a
senior
executive
told
reuters
underscoring
the
scale
of
the
bet
being
made
by
africa
s
richest
man
on
nigerian
oil
and
gas
dangote
has
built
his
fortune
on
cement
although
his
sprawling
business
empire
also
spans
flour
milling
agriculture
and
real
estate
now
he
is
building
the
world
s
largest
single
oil
refinery
and
also
expanding
into
fertiliser
aiming
to
address
problems
in
nigeria
s
energy
markets
though
africa
s
biggest
crude
oil
producer
nigeria
imports
almost
all
of
its
gasoline
due
to
poor
maintenance
of
its
four
refineries
dangote
hopes
to
meet
the
fuel
needs
of
africa
s
most
populous
nation
where
poor
power
supply
forces
families
and
businesses
to
rely
on
generators
dangote
group
executive
director
devakumar
edwin
said
the
billion
refinery
should
be
completed
by
december
as
of
today
cement
is
the
biggest
part
of
the
group
by
the
refinery
will
be
the
biggest
by
assets
he
told
reuters
in
an
interview
at
the
site
in
the
lekki
district
of
southwestern
lagos
state
dangote
cement
nigeria
s
biggest
listed
company
has
attracted
investment
from
dubai
and
south
african
sovereign
funds
it
posted
a
profit
of
billion
naira
million
up
percent
on
and
is
valued
at
billion
edwin
said
the
oil
refinery
with
a
capacity
of
barrels
per
day
would
also
target
export
markets
our
primary
focus
is
nigeria
to
meet
the
entire
local
demand
but
we
have
the
capacity
to
export
more
than
percent
of
what
we
produce
so
the
secondary
focus
will
be
on
western
africa
and
central
africa
he
said
edwin
said
the
company
had
held
talks
with
firms
including
vitol
and
shell
over
the
supply
of
crude
and
lifting
of
petroleum
products
for
sale
abroad
the
dangote
refinery
will
be
able
to
process
different
grades
of
crude
including
shale
oil
the
company
is
borrowing
billion
for
the
project
arranged
by
standard
chartered
bank
the
remainder
will
be
funded
by
equity
and
through
export
agencies
edwin
said
dangote
has
also
acquired
two
oil
fields
in
nigeria
from
shell
to
help
supply
the
refinery
edwin
said
the
first
phase
of
the
million
tonne
capacity
fertiliser
plant
on
the
same
lagos
state
site
would
be
completed
in
september
and
start
operating
in
december
the
second
line
also
million
tonnes
will
start
four
months
later
he
added
the
refinery
and
petrochemical
complex
located
on
hectares
of
swampy
land
includes
a
jetty
to
ferry
products
by
sea
within
nigeria
and
abroad
and
an
undersea
pipeline
to
transport
gas
dangote
will
consider
listing
the
oil
refinery
once
it
comes
onstream
edwin
added
he
said
that
would
follow
a
planned
listing
of
the
cement
company
in
london
next
year
after
elections
in
nigeria
that
listing
has
been
mooted
for
a
number
of
years
plans
have
been
delayed
to
enable
the
company
to
meet
requirements
for
the
listing
which
edwin
said
had
been
completed
he
said
the
listing
could
help
it
fund
acquisitions
