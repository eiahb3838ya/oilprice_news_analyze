beijing

it
is
not
often
that
the
niche
world
of
commodities
trading
enters
the
public
conversation
but
on
friday
china
s
social
media
was
rooting
for
a
ship
carrying
soybeans
from
the
united
states
to
beat
the
deadline
before
chinese
tariffs
kicked
in
tracking
the
journey
of
the
vessel
peak
pegasus
as
it
motored
toward
the
northern
chinese
port
of
dalian
was
the
trending
topic
on
the
country
s
weibo
on
friday
beating
out
the
world
cup
showbiz
gossip
and
beijing
s
escalating
trade
war
with
washington
reuters
was
the
first
to
report
on
the
final
stages
of
the
vessel
s
voyage
to
china
as
the
countdown
began
for
the
united
states
and
china
to
impose
their
duties
on
billion
worth
of
each
other
s
goods
weibo
users
offered
encouragement
and
support
to
the
cargo
which
left
seattle
on
june
as
it
became
uncertain
whether
the
ship
would
dock
and
unload
its
cargo
before
noon
on
friday
when
the
new
tariffs
took
effect
good
luck
bro
said
one
weibo
user
you
are
no
ordinary
soybean
said
another
soybeans
are
the
top
agricultural
export
to
china
with
the
trade
worth
billion
in
last
week
the
peak
pegasus
had
been
scheduled
to
land
with
just
hours
to
spare
according
to
thomson
reuters
eikon
shipping
data
its
arrival
was
pushed
back
in
recent
days
to
gmt
on
friday
alas
the
peak
pegasus
fell
short
at
it
was
at
anchor
near
dalian
missing
the
noon
deadline
the
comments
showed
how
aspects
of
beijing
s
rift
with
washington
have
seeped
into
the
public
consciousness
they
also
offered
a
rare
moment
of
humor
in
an
increasingly
acrimonious
row
between
the
world
s
top
two
economies
chinese
state
media
have
slammed
the
protectionist
policies
of
president
donald
trump
and
on
friday
likened
his
administration
to
a
gang
of
hoodlums
but
the
trade
conflict
has
gained
little
traction
on
china
s
tightly
controlled
social
media
still
one
weibo
user
with
tongue
firmly
in
cheek
worried
that
the
soybeans
might
get
seasick
while
another
offered
the
beans
some
wry
advice
on
how
to
avoid
getting
snarled
up
in
the
deepening
row
poor
little
soybeans
try
to
become
a
bean
sprout
maybe
it
s
not
on
the
tariff
list
the
user
said
one
post
offered
to
take
the
beans
on
a
romantic
break
to
turkey
it
is
not
the
first
time
the
peak
pegasus
has
had
a
starring
role
in
beijing
s
trade
showdown
with
washington
in
april
the
ship
detoured
to
south
korea
from
southern
china
after
the
country
imposed
hefty
margin
deposits
on
imports
