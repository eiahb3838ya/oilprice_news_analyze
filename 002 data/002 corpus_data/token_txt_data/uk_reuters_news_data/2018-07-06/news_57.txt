reuters
conocophillips
moved
to
bring
venezuelan
pdvsa
s
refining
unit
citgo
petroleum
into
its
legal
battles
to
enforce
a
billion
arbitration
award
against
the
south
american
country
s
nationalization
of
its
venezuelan
assets
a
district
court
judge
in
houston
on
thursday
ruled
conoco
can
depose
citgo
as
preparation
for
a
court
case
against
pdvsa
and
others
over
alleged
asset
transfers
in
the
caribbean
that
conoco
claims
were
designed
to
frustrate
its
efforts
to
obtain
payment
under
an
international
chamber
of
commerce
icc
award
citgo
declined
to
comment
citing
a
policy
regarding
ongoing
litigation
conoco
is
pleased
with
the
court
s
decision
spokesman
daren
beaudo
said
in
a
statement
the
company
has
not
received
any
payment
from
pdvsa
for
the
award
and
will
continue
to
pursue
the
matter
he
added
the
decision
is
another
blow
to
the
venezuelan
oil
company
which
has
struggled
to
pay
creditors
as
its
oil
production
has
fallen
to
the
lowest
level
in
more
than
three
decades
conoco
alleges
pdvsa
transferred
crude
and
fuels
stored
at
the
isla
refinery
and
bullenbay
terminal
in
curacao
to
citgo
to
prevent
it
from
seizing
the
oil
to
enforce
the
icc
award
according
to
its
filing
with
a
district
in
houston
the
court
filing
portrays
active
and
often
successful
efforts
by
pdvsa
and
its
subsidiary
to
defeat
conoco
s
bids
to
seize
oil
cargoes
and
other
assets
in
one
case
it
claims
pdvsa
caused
citgo
petroleum
to
claim
ownership
of
cargoes
off
aruba
as
a
way
to
lift
the
company
s
liens
conoco
said
in
its
june
filing
pdvsa
also
denied
court
officers
access
to
some
ships
docked
near
curacao
and
at
least
one
vessel
temporarily
disabled
its
gps
transponder
to
make
a
getaway
avoiding
seizure
the
filing
said
conoco
s
assets
in
venezuela
were
expropriated
in
after
the
late
president
hugo
chavez
nationalized
several
oil
projects
by
forcing
their
conversion
into
joint
ventures
controlled
by
pdvsa
conoco
and
exxon
mobil
corp
left
venezuela
after
they
were
unable
to
reach
agreements
with
pdvsa
as
part
of
the
arbitration
award
conoco
was
able
to
place
liens
on
assets
owned
or
rented
in
curacao
aruba
bonaire
and
eustatius
including
inventories
held
at
refineries
and
terminals
and
cargoes
aboard
vessels
but
those
efforts
have
been
hindered
by
local
groups
and
courts
a
curacao
court
provisionally
lifted
conoco
s
claims
on
the
isla
refinery
in
may
after
public
utilities
and
the
island
s
government
petitioned
the
court
citing
their
need
for
the
fuels
