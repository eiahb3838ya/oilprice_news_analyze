libya
s
national
oil
corporation
noc
is
asking
for
sanctions
against
individuals
and
entities
they
accuse
of
trying
to
sell
oil
illicitly
in
a
struggle
over
the
country
s
oil
wealth
in
a
letter
circulated
to
foreign
embassies
and
the
united

and

noc
chairman
mustafa
sanalla
described
a
surge
in
attempts
by
eastern
factions
to
market
oil
ahead
of
them
taking
control
last
month
of
key
fields
and
export
terminals
since
western
powers
and
security
council
resolutions
have
backed
the
noc
in
tripoli
the
capital
as
the
sole
legitimate
producer
and
seller
of
libyan
oil
warning
that
illicit
exports
could
lead
to
further
fragmentation
of
the
divided
country
that
has
deterred
buyers
and
banks
wary
of
dealing
with
an
unrecognised
entity
but
sanalla
s
letter
and
copies
of
contracts
that
noc
tripoli
says
were
passed
on
by
people
involved
in
oil
trading
allege
that
a
parallel
noc
in
the
eastern
city
of
benghazi
has
stepped
up
its
campaign
to
market
oil
under
faraj
said
head
of
the
firm
since
last
august
this
noc
benghazi
headed
by
faraj
said
is
pursuing
a
complex
and
combined
strategy
focussed
on
destabilising
noc
including
via
illicit
exports
contracts
and
blockades
to
ultimately
gain
control
of
libyan
oil
sanalla
wrote
the
letter
was
sent
about
days
before
forces
loyal
to
commander
khalifa
haftar
announced
that
they
would
hand
east
libyan
ports
and
fields
to
the
benghazi
noc
raising
the
stakes
over
the
contest
for
the
sparsely
populated
country
s
oil
production
has
plummeted
by
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
from
little
more
than
one
million
bpd
as
eastern
officials
have
blocked
tankers
booked
by
noc
tripoli
from
loading
effectively
shutting
zueitina
and
hariga
ports
haftar
s
libyan
national
army
lna
has
also
prevented
noc
tripoli
from
reopening
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
after
fending
off
an
armed
attack
against
the
ports
last
month
the
standoff
is
part
of
a
wider
conflict
that
developed
after
the
uprising
against
muammar
gaddafi
seven
years
ago
factions
aligned
with
rival
governments
in
the
east
and
west
have
competed
for
power
since
disputed
elections
in
about
of
libya
s
oil
production
is
based
in
the
east
but
oil
sales
and
revenues
have
been
processed
through
tripoli
home
to
an
internationally
backed
interim
government
some
in
the
east
have
long
complained
that
they
receive
too
few
oil
revenues
though
officials
in
tripoli
dispute
that
the
lna
said
this
week
that
it
was
seeking
the
replacement
of
the
central
bank
governor
in
tripoli
who
it
also
blames
for
funnelling
money
to
its
armed
opponents
a
charge
that
central
bank
officials
in
the
capital
deny
said
and
his
office
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
he
told
reuters
last
week
that
noc
east
which
claims
legitimacy
through
an
eastern
parliament
and
government
was
not
rushing
oil
sales
the
important
thing
is
for
the
oil
money
to
go
to
a
safe
place
he
said
sanalla
s
letter
says
that
even
before
eastern
factions
announced
they
would
take
over
oil
ports
they
had
tried
in
may
to
export
barrels
from
hariga
port
on
a
tanker
named
phaedra
bright
but
the
tanker
was
persuaded
to
turn
back
before
it
loaded
according
to
noc
tripoli
noc
benghazi
has
been
offering
buyers
substantial
discounts
that
would
lead
to
losses
in
revenue
of
at
least
million
noc
tripoli
estimates
that
libya
is
already
losing
more
than
million
daily
because
of
the
port
stoppages
sanalla
called
for
travel
bans
and
asset
freezes
under
a
sanctions
regime
to
be
imposed
on
said
and
other
senior
noc
benghazi
officials
as
well
as
on
traders
and
energy
companies
allocated
contracts
by
the
eastern
noc
failure
to
act
could
have
grave
consequences
for
peace
and
security
in
libya
sanalla
wrote
in
particular
i
am
concerned
that
these
efforts
may
accelerate
ahead
of
the
elections
planned
for
december
and
that
they
may
create
conditions
that
interfere
with
the
acceptance
by
certain
segments
of
the
libyan
population
of
election
