reuters
officials
are
touring
the
globe
to
pressure
countries
to
shun
trade
with
iran
following
washington
s
withdrawal
from
a
nuclear
deal
between
tehran
and
world
powers
a
move
that
undermines
european
efforts
to
save
the
accord
sources
said
state
and
treasury
department
officials
have
travelled
to
japan
and
this
week
diplomats
are
in
eastern
europe
as
britain
france
and
germany
scramble
to
save
the
pact
and
convince
iran
that
they
can
continue
to
do
business
with
tehran
the
americans
are
on
a
roadshow
and
going
everywhere
they
are
dogmatic
said
a
senior
european
diplomat
we
were
clear
and
told
them
if
you
are
coming
to
tell
to
us
how
to
apply
american
laws
here
then
you
re
not
welcome
the
diplomat
said
ministers
from
the
three
european
nations
and
the
eu
foreign
policy
chief
have
written
to
counterparts
urging
them
to
protect
eu
companies
working
in
iran
from
getting
caught
up
in
washington
s
new
sanctions
on
the
islamic
republic
in
the
june
letter
the
foreign
and
finance
ministers
singled
out
areas
where
they
expected
exemptions
for
eu
firms
including
pharmaceuticals
healthcare
energy
automotive
civil
aviation
infrastructure
and
banking
the
letter
appeared
to
accept
that
despite
their
efforts
to
circumvent
secondary
sanctions
the
action
could
prevent
the
eu
from
continuing
meaningful
sanctions
relief
to
the
roadshow
suggests
there
is
little
appetite
in
washington
to
compromise
we
will
hold
those
doing
prohibited
business
in
iran
to
account
under
secretary
of
the
treasury
sigal
mandelker
said
in
a
blunt
speech
on
tuesday
a
second
eu
official
said
the
was
sending
out
such
teams
across
the
world
with
a
private
warning
against
doing
business
with
iran
washington
last
month
said
it
would
impose
new
economic
penalties
after
pulling
out
of
the
accord
that
world
powers
struck
with
iran
under
which
tehran
agreed
to
curb
its
nuclear
activities
in
return
for
sanctions
relief
one
eu
official
said
the
united
states
had
also
pressed
the
european
investment
bank
which
has
never
done
business
in
iran
not
to
invest
in
european
firms
doing
business
there
despite
a
european
commission
proposal
it
start
doing
so
the
european
powers
are
trying
to
come
up
with
a
package
to
trade
with
iran
against
renewed
financial
sanctions
to
dissuade
tehran
from
quitting
the
accord
but
the
global
reach
of
the
financial
system
forcing
companies
to
choose
between
two
irreconcilable
options
selling
to
iran
or
to
the
vast
market
is
driving
home
the
limits
of
european
efforts
to
shield
their
revived
trade
with
tehran
according
to
two
diplomats
andrew
peek
deputy
assistant
secretary
of
state
with
responsibility
for
iran
and
iraq
was
in
the
czech
republic
on
tuesday
and
hungary
on
wednesday
the
state
department
delegation
to
europe
seeks
to
garner
support
for
our
global
effort
to
pressure
iran
and
to
explain
our
sanctions
policy
an
state
department
official
said
we
are
making
stops
to
many
countries
and
will
expand
our
diplomatic
outreach
efforts
worldwide
in
the
coming
weeks
meanwhile
our
engagement
with
the
britain
france
germany
is
including
during
this
worldwide
diplomatic
peek
briefed
senior
eu
diplomats
in
washington
in
may
and
warned
the
bloc
to
cut
investments
in
iran
telling
eu
officials
doing
business
with
tehran
helped
fund
its
missile
programme
and
support
for
proxies
in
yemen
and
syria
diplomats
said
one
diplomat
said
the
focus
on
eastern
european
nations
might
be
designed
to
pressure
those
eu
countries
most
dependent
on
security
assistance
in
the
face
of
a
resurgent
russia
however
another
diplomat
suggested
the
push
could
backfire
this
escalation
and
strategy
of
confrontation
is
a
serious
mistake
and
risks
provoking
even
more
chaos
and
instability
in
the
middle
east
said
a
diplomat
aware
of
the
roadshow
saying
efforts
had
begun
to
irritate
