being
criticized
by
another
important
constituency
the
main
union
for
oil
refinery
workers
the
united
steelworkers
the
largest
industrial
union
in
north
america
representing
refinery
workers
said
the
decision
leaves
in
place
a
costly
regulation
that
puts
at
risk
thousands
of
blue
collar
jobs
of
the
type
trump
has
promised
to
preserve
inaction
by
the
trump
administration
now
threatens
the
livelihood
of
thousands
of
east
coast
refinery
workers
and
tens
of
thousands
of
related
jobs
throughout
the
northeast
the
union
said
in
a
statement
on
wednesday
trump
on
tuesday
had
told
midwestern
lawmakers
he
would
drop
a
proposed
deal
to
tweak
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
to
cut
costs
to
refineries
saying
he
understood
the
move
would
hurt
farmers
sources

with
the
matter
told
reuters
senators
chuck
grassley
and
joni
ernst
from
the
farm
state
of
iowa
along
with
biofuels
industry
representatives
in
favor
of
the
existing
legislation
praised
trump
and
prices
for
renewable
fuel
credits
soared
more
than
percent
in
morning
trade
with
no
official
decision
there
is
more
to
come
on
this

inc
merchant
refiners
would
not
stop
looking
for
help
williams
said
the
white
house
was
poised
to
announce
proposed
changes
this
week
after
hosting
months
of
difficult
negotiations
between
representatives
of
big
oil
and
big
corn
the
deal
would
have
eased
pressure
on
the
refining
industry
by
allowing
biofuels
exports
to
count
toward
the
annual
volumes
quotas
but
would
also
have
expanded
sales
of
gasoline
in
a
concession
to
biofuels
producers
oil
refiner
pennsylvania
energy
solutions
had
blamed
its
bankruptcy
this
year
on
the
cost
of
complying
with
the
rfs
and
other
refining
companies
in
the
region
have
said
they
are
also
struggling
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
regulation
including
monroe
energy
and
pbf
energy
the
american
petroleum
institute
which
represents
big
oil
and
gas
companies
like
exxon
mobil
and
chevron
corp
said
it
was
pleased
the
reform
deal
collapsed
because
it
would
prefer
a
broader
comprehensive
legislative
ethanol
and
oil
gas
don
t
see
eye
to
eye
on
the
rfs
but
in
this
case
we
agree
that
it
s
good
news
that
this
proposed
deal
collapsed
said
frank
macchiarola
group
director
of
downstream
and
industry
operations
at
api
the
rfs
requires
oil
refiners
to
mix
increasing
volumes
of
biofuels
including
ethanol
into
fuel
each
year
and
to
prove
compliance
by
earning
or
acquiring
blending
credits
and
handing
them
in
to
the
environmental
protection
agency
the
law
has
helped
corn
farmers
by
creating
a
market
for
ethanol
but
refining
companies
have
complained
that
compliance
costs
are
too
high
and
threatens
jobs
the
white
house
and
the
epa
did
not
respond
to
requests
on
wednesday
for
comment
on
the
policy
suspension
trump
telephoned
iowa
senator
ernst
on
tuesday
afternoon
to
tell
him
that
he
would
drop
the
plan
trump
had
asked
her
if
farmers
could
support
the
deal
and
she
responded
no
according
to
sources
briefed
on
the
phone
call
he
later
called
grassley
one
of
the
most
vocal
advocates
of
the
biofuel
industry
the
sources
said
both
cheered
the
decision
on
twitter
late
on
tuesday
realdonaldtrump
has
said
he
loooovves
the
farmers
iowa
is
feeling
that
love
today
as
the
president
just
assured
me
he
won
t
sign
a
deal
that
s
bad
for
farmers
thank
you
president
wrote
ernst
trump
in
a
bill
signing
at
the
white
house
on
wednesday
appeared
to
give
a
nod
to
the
move
when
he
addressed
republican
ernst
where
s
joni
i
did
you
a
good
favor
for
the
farmers
yesterday
right
we
love
the
farmers
right
joni
good
good
i
m
glad
it
worked
out
he
said
pressure
from
merchant
refiners
like
pbf
and
valero
to
reform
the
program
had
already
eased
in
recent
weeks
as
the
epa
took
unilateral
steps
handing
out
waivers
to
small
facilities
exempting
them
from
the
rfs
that
resulted
in
significantly
lower
compliance
costs
ethanol
groups
praised
the
move
but
signaled
that
more
needed
to
be
done
to
rectify
some
of
the
epa
s
activities
around
the
small
refinery
program
and
to
boost
use
of
higher
ethanol
blends
in
the
marketplace
renewable
fuel
credit
prices
are
down
sharply
since
late
last
year
because
of
the
epa
waivers
which
biofuels
advocates
say
have
undercut
ethanol
