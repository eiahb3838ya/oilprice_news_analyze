the

told

but
riku
huttunen

comments
suggest
they

set
to
stay
in

the
olkiluoto
reactor
which

olkiluoto
commissioned
two
years
later
have
a

capacity
of

and
account
for
around
of
finland
s
electricity
needs
all
basic
preconditions
seem
to
be
fulfilled
the
decision
will
be
taken
in

most
likely
said
huttunen
who
heads
the
energy
department
within
finland
s
economy
ministry
a
final
decision
on

will
be

renewing
the
licences
for
the
two
older

and
adding
another
