analysis-airlines struggle with global pilot shortage
reuters
a
growing
shortage
of
airline
pilots
is
putting
the
industry
s
recent
growth
at
risk
as
planes
sit
idle
higher
salaries
cut
into
profits
and
unions
across
the
globe
push
for
more
benefits
carriers
such
as
emirates
and
australia
s
qantas
airways
have
poured
resources
into
hiring
but
struggled
in
recent
months
to
use
their
jets
as
often
as
their
business
plans
dictate
because
of
training
bottlenecks
pilots
at
ireland
s
ryanair
are
forming
unions
across
europe
seeking
better
working
conditions
and
those
at
air
france
are
striking
over
pay
in
the
united
states
pilots
who
took
pay
cuts
when
carriers
went
bankrupt
a
decade
ago
are
receiving
big
raises
under
new
contracts
now
that
airlines
are
posting
strong
profits
the
surge
in
employee
costs
which
rival
fuel
as
the
biggest
strain
on
an
airline
s
finances
comes
as
higher
oil
prices
are
already
squeezing
margins
airlines
say
ticket
prices
have
not
kept
pace
with
costs
these
cost
pressures
are
not
about
to
stop
imminently
international
air
transport
association
iata
chief
economist
brian
pearce
said
at
the
trade
group
s
annual
meeting
in
sydney
where
iata
lowered
its
airline
profit
forecast
by
percent
citing
higher
fuel
and
labor
costs
it
s
the
symptom
of
a
wider
issue
if
we
look
at
developed
economies
unemployment
in
the
oecd
has
fallen
to
lows
and
we
are
starting
to
get
wage
pressures
of
which
pilot
shortages
are
a
symptom
in
our
industry
he
told
airline
bosses
many
of
whom
expressed
concern
about
a
shortage
on
the
sidelines
of
the
iata
annual
meeting
this
week
inflation
is
beginning
to
take
hold
in
oecd
economies
after
years
of
lying
dormant
and
pilot
wages
also
reflect
that
pearce
added
the
high
cost
of
pilot
training
and
several
years
of
earlier
hiring
freezes
in
markets
like
the
united
states
and
australia
have
deterred
potential
aviators
from
entering
an
industry
that
boeing
says
will
need
more
pilots
over
the
next
years
iata
estimates
airline
traffic
will
nearly
double
during
that
period
so
companies
like
canadian
training
group
cae
inc
and
technologies
are
building
new
flight
simulators
to
cash
in
on
training
demand
planemakers
airbus
and
boeing
are
also
expanding
into
services
like
training
where
margins
are
potentially
higher
than
building
jets
and
some
airlines
are
planning
to
expand
training
programs
qantas
says
it
will
invest
a
million
million
in
a
new
flying
school
to
ensure
a
supply
of
pilots
amid
high
turnover
in
its
regional
arm
qantaslink
emirates
opened
a
million
fight
training
academy
in
november
for
up
to
cadets
we
have
a
social
responsibility
qantas
domestic
ceo
andrew
david
said
we
can
continue
to
take
pilots
from
smaller
players
in
this
country
and
elsewhere
but
we
need
to
give
back
and
that
is
part
of
what
we
are
doing
here
as
other
airlines
are
having
to
look
outside
their
home
markets
competing
with
china
where
experienced
foreign
captains
are
in
high
demand
and
airlines
offer
annual
salaries
of
up
to
tax
free
there
is
not
so
much
a
shortage
of
pilots
as
a
rising
cost
of
attracting
and
retaining
the
pilots
you
need
particularly
the
experienced
ones
said
andrew
herdman
director
general
of
the
association
of
asia
pacific
airlines
there
is
a
bidding
war
going
in
countries
where
average
wages
are
relatively
low
pilots
are
being
offered
much
cushier
pay
packages
than
other
professions
because
they
are
internationally
mobile
and
must
speak
english
the
global
language
of
aviation
srilankan
airlines
has
lost
a
steady
trickle
of
pilots
to
gulf
carriers
srilankan
ceo
suren
ratwatte
who
was
an
emirates
pilot
told
reuters
we
pay
pretty
well
because
the
pilots
going
away
from
the
company
go
mainly
to
the
middle
east
and
we
tend
to
get
very
close
to
gulf
salaries
except
we
are
living
in
sri
lanka
he
said
your
lifestyle
is
pretty
thailand
s
bangkok
airways
pcl
is
raising
pilot
salaries
and
benefits
and
hiring
foreigners
for
international
flying
president
puttipong
said
pilot
unions
are
taking
advantage
of
shortages
to
ask
for
better
conditions
for
their
members
dan
adamus
president
of
the

pilots
association
alpa
canada
said
canadian
pilots
are
generally
getting
pay
raises
although
salaries
at
mainline
carriers
are
higher
than
at
air
canada
it
s
certainly
harder
for
airlines
to
recruit
qualified
pilots
he
said
which
has
led
carriers
to
raise
pay
the
pilots
are
going
to
go
where
there
is
better
he
estimates
that
about
canadian
pilots
are
flying
for
carriers
overseas
such
as
emirates
airlines
considered
top
employers
in
their
home
country
such
as
qantas
and
british
airways
are
not
yet
facing
shortages
of
qualified
applicants

a
former

at
ireland
s
aer
lingus
said
that
there
were
signs
of
pinch
points
within
the
broader
industry
but
that
he
did
not
believe
there
was
a
shortage
the
day
you
see
me
back
flying
is
the
day
you
know
there
s
a
