reactors
and
coal
plants
said
they
had
not
changed
plans
to
close
plants
in
coming
years
even
after
the
white
house
said
it
would
take
emergency
steps
to
subsidize
struggling
operators
president
donald
trump
last
week
directed
energy
secretary
rick
perry
to
take
steps
to
keep
coal
and
nuclear
power
plants
running
citing
a
national
security
law
as
justification
that
announcement
triggered
backlash
from
drillers
renewable
energy
producers
and
environmentalists
who
call
it
an
unfair
attempt
to
prop
up
industries
and
burden
ratepayers
with
billions
of
dollars
of
additional
power
costs
annually
nrg
energy
inc
which
owns
nuclear
coal
and
natural
gas
power
plants
agreed
we
re
very
concerned
to
have
consumer
money
subsidize
plants
it
s
never
good
when
government
starts
picking
and
choosing
winners
and
losers

chief
executive
exelon
corp
the
country
s
largest
nuclear
operator
has
said
in
the
past
that
it
wants
energy
regulators
and
grid
operators
to
find
solutions
that
would
pay
generators
for
the
power
their
plants
provide
however
exelon
ceo
chris
crane
said
at
a
conference
wednesday
that
the
power
grid
s
vulnerability
needs
to
be
analyzed
because
if
we
don
t
focus
on
resiliency
and
national
security
we
could
end
up
in
a
very
dire
new
york
and
illinois
and
more
recently
new
jersey
already
provide
subsidies
to
nuclear
operators
firstenergy
solutions
a
unit
of
firstenergy
corp
said
tuesday
that
it
still
plans
to
retire
four
reactors
in
coming
years
along
with
a
coal
plant
in
ohio
because
it
does
not
have
enough
information
about
the
federal
plan
the
company
in
march
called
on
the
trump
administration
to
protect
coal
and
nuclear
plants
new

group
inc
said
it
still
plans
to
shut
its
last
remaining

will
keep
its

jersey
operating
after
state
subsidies
were
approved
vistra
energy
corp
which
recently
shut
three
coal
plants
in
that
state
declined
comment
power
prices
have
fallen
to
record
lows
in
many
parts
of
the
country
due
to
cheap
supplies
of
natural
gas
and
increasing
use
of
renewable
energy
like
wind
and
solar
displacing
costlier
coal
and
nuclear
power
perry
in
september
asked
federal
regulators
to
adopt
rules
to
protect
coal
and
nuclear
plants
from
early
retirement
federal
energy
regulators
however
rejected
that
plan
