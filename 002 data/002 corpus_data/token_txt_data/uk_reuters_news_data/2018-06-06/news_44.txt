iran stands ground on nuclear inspections as france warns of red line
june
reuters
iran
will
not
cooperate
more
fully
with
atomic
inspectors
until
a
standoff
over
its
nuclear
deal
is
resolved
its
envoy
said
as
one
signatory
warned
tehran
against
moving
ahead
with
preparations
to
boost
its
uranium
enrichment
capacity
european
powers
have
been
scrambling
to
salvage
the
agreement
they
signed
in
since
president
donald
trump
pulled
washington
out
last
month
and
said
he
would
reimpose
sanctions
on
iran
foreign
and
finance
ministers
from
those
three
countries
france
britain
and
germany
have
written
to
officials
to
stress
their
commitment
to
upholding
the
pact
and
to
urge
washington
to
spare
eu
firms
active
in
iran
from
secondary
sanctions
an
iranian
withdrawal
from
the
deal
which
lifted
sanctions
on
tehran
in
exchange
for
curbs
on
its
nuclear
programme
would
further
unsettle
a
region
where
additional
conflicts
would
be
disastrous
the
ministers
wrote
in
the
letter
dated
june
and
seen
by
reuters
on
wednesday
since
the
pullout
was
announced
authorities
in
tehran
have
sent
mixed
signals
on
whether
they
believe
the
nuclear
deal
s
remaining
signatories
which
also
include
china
and
russia
can
salvage
it
supreme
leader
ayatollah
khamenei
said
on
monday
he
had
ordered
preparations
to
increase
uranium
enrichment
capacity
if
the
agreement
collapsed
tehran
also
informed
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
iaea
the
nuclear
watchdog
that
polices
restrictions
placed
on
its
activities
under
the
deal
of
tentative
plans
to
produce
the
feedstock
for
centrifuges
the
machines
that
enrich
uranium
in
paris
on
wednesday
french
foreign
minister
yves
le
drian
told
europe
radio
that
while
that
initiative
remained
within
the
framework
of
the
nuclear
deal
it
was
unwelcome
and
risked
sailing
close
to
a
red
line
emphasising
that
tehran
s
patience
with
european
efforts
to
save
the
deal
was
not
unlimited
its
envoy
to
the
iaea
said
it
had
granted
the
three
powers
a
few
weeks
a
few
weeks
means
a
few
weeks
not
a
few
months
reza
najafi
said
outside
a
quarterly
meeting
of
the
agency
s
board
of
governors
in
vienna
he
also
dismissed
calls
by
the
iaea
to
go
the
extra
mile
in
cooperating
with
the
nuclear
watchdog
s
inspectors
telling
reporters
that
while
the
standoff
over
the
deal
continued
no
one
should
expect
iran
to
go
to
implement
more
voluntary
but
i
should
emphasize
that
it
does
not
mean
that
right
now
iran
will
restart
any
activities
contrary
to
the
deal
najafi
added
these
are
only
preparatory
the
agency
has
said
tehran
is
implementing
its
commitments
but
also
called
for
timely
and
proactive
cooperation
on
providing
access
for
snap
inspections
diplomats
who
deal
with
the
agency
say
an
inspection
in
late
april
went
down
to
the
wire
in
terms
of
how
quickly
the
iaea
team
gained
access
to
one
site
