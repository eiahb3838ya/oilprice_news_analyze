in
the
lucrative
central
asian
fuel
market
once
it
finishes

its
oil
refineries
officials
in
astana
and
industry
sources
said
the

is
considering
halting
light
oil
product
imports
from
russia
and
lifting
a
ban
on
such
exports
that
was
originally
imposed
to
ensure
reliable
supplies
on
the
domestic
market
they
said
astana
has
been
looking
at
selling
into
other
former
soviet
republics
and
beyond
a
market
dominated
by
russia
for
some
time
central
asia
and
afghanistan
are
the
key
markets
for
kazakhstan
energy
minister
kanat
bozumbayev
said
last
year
but
now
kazakhstan
the
region
s
second
biggest
crude
oil
producer
after
russia
is
achieving
a
surplus
over
its
own
gasoline
and
diesel
needs
meaning
it
can
start
acting
on
the
idea
kazakhstan
is
rapidly
expanding
production
at
its
three
large
refineries
it
has
completed
upgrading
the
pavlodar
plant
with
work
at
atyrau
and
shymkent
expected
to
be
finished
soon
the
energy
ministry
said
in
response
to
reuters
questions
the
plants
combined
annual
oil
products
output
will
increase
by
eight
percent
to
million
tonnes
this
year
while
gasoline
and
diesel
production
will
exceed
kazakhstan
s
domestic
demand
by
million
tonnes
per
year
the
energy
ministry
said
despite
producing
million
barrels
of
crude
per
day
kazakhstan
has
long
imported
oil
products
from
its
former
master
russia
due
to
the
past
lack
of
refining
capacity
these
amount
to
around
million
tonnes
a
year
its
ambitions
mark
another
step
away
from
moscow
for
kazakhstan
where
around
percent
of
the
population
are
fluent
russian
speakers
but
which
is
planning
to
a
switch
to
a
alphabet
from
cyrillic
kazakhstan
has
already
faced
overproduction
of
gasoline
this
year
which
has
led
to
lower
prices
aiming
to
remove
the
surplus
the
government
plans
to
ban
imports
of
the
popular
grade
of
gasoline
and
secure
a
deal
to
supply
neighbouring
kyrgyzstan
the
energy
ministry
told
reuters
in
an
email
the
government
wants
to
start
active
discussions
of
these
issues
in
parliament
in
june
a
source
close
to
the
government
said
according
to
the
energy
ministry
estimates
imports
of
russian
gasoline
reached
tonnes
in
surpassing
the
plan
of
tonnes
for
the
whole
of
russia
is
set
to
supply
tonnes
of
gasoline
tonnes
of
diesel
and
tonnes
of
jet
fuel
to
kazakhstan
as
moscow
raises
exports
due
to
its
own
extensive
refineries
modernisation
kazakhstan
in
its
turn
may
export
tonnes
of
gasoline
this
year
increasing
to
tonnes
in
according
to
industry
sources
and
reuters
calculations
combined
annual
imports
of
light
oil
products
by
kyrgyzstan
tajikistan
and
afghanistan
stand
at
around
million
tonnes
