vowed

worries
about
italy
exiting
the
euro
zone
the
lingering
concerns
over
trade
tariffs
and
the
risk
of
a

war
remained

weighing

exemption
on
steel
and
aluminium
for

kudlow
also
revived
the
possibility
that
the
president
will
seek
to
replace
nafta
with
bilateral
deals
with
canada
and
mexico
the
threat
of
rising
trade
protectionism
has
already
taken

trade
and
could
increase
risks
to
growth
