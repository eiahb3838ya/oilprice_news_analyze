update 4-venezuela's pdvsa raises prospect of force majeure on oil exports -sources
reuters
opec
member
venezuela
has
raised
the
prospect
of
declaring
force
majeure
on
contracts
with
major
crude
buyers
amid
plummeting
output
from
its
oil
fields
and
tanker
bottlenecks
at
ports
according
to
three
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
falling
production
from
venezuela
has
contributed
to
a
rally
in
global
oil
prices
to
a
near
high
and
other
opec
members
may
boost
output
at
a
meeting
later
this
month
to
compensate
for
the
shortfall
and
other
risks
to
global
supplies
oil
is
the
financial
lifeline
for
the
embattled
socialist
government
of
president
nicolas
maduro
but
his
administration
has
failed
to
invest
enough
in
the
industry
to
prevent
its
decline
venezuela
s
oil
firm
pdvsa
has
told
some
customers
that
they
must
send
vessels
equipped
to
accept
oil
transfers
rather
than
load
at
its
ports
if
they
do
not
accept
the
terms
pdvsa
is
considering
force
majeure
in
essence
declaring
its
contracts
incapable
of
being
fulfilled
the
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
it
has
separately
begun
notifying
all
its
customers
that
it
will
no
longer
receive
new
tankers
for
loading
at
jose
or
paraguana
its
main
export
terminals
until
ships
already
in
line
are
served
most
customers
have
so
far
refused
the
transfer
request
due
to
the
lack
of
a
third
party
supervising
the
operations
according
to
shippers
and
traders
additional
costs
for
completing
the
transfer
also
contributed
to
the
refusals
pdvsa
has
been
using
sanctions
imposed
on
the
company
by
president
donald
trump
as
a
rationale
for
the
change
according
to
one
of
the
sources
venezuela
s
export
terminals
have
grown
overcrowded
since
oil
firm
conocophillips
last
month
won
court
orders
freezing
pdvsa
s
key
caribbean
operations
where
the
venezuelan
company
used
to
ship
large
cargoes
to
asian
destinations
there
were
more
than
tankers
off
the
coast
of
venezuela
on
tuesday
according
to
thomson
reuters
vessel
tracking
data
we
are
going
to
try
the
idea
first
the
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
many
customers
are
going
to
prefer
this
than
continuing
to
accumulate
demurrage
the
source
added
referring
to
fees
charged
for
long
waiting
times
one
of
pdvsa
s
indian
customers
confirmed
it
had
received
a
request
to
load
its
cargoes
via
transfers
the
buyer
so
far
has
refused
to
accept
the
new
terms
said
an
employee
who
was
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
and
requested
anonymity
traders
and
shippers
were
skeptical
that
the
transfers
would
succeed
in
easing
the
bottlenecks
pdvsa
will
still
have
to
load
vessels
at
its
jose
port
for
transporting
the
crude
to
its
proposed
offshore
loading
facility
and
production
declines
are
not
expected
to
reverse
very
large
vessels
that
typically
do
not
approach
venezuela
s
western
coast
are
now
visible
from
paraguana
refining
center
crp
according
to
a
worker
from
the
facility
pdvsa
did
not
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
pdvsa
knew
it
would
fall
short
of
contracted
deliveries
this
year
because
of
declining
output
and
set
a
goal
to
limit
the
gap
according
to
internal
company
documents
reviewed
by
reuters
but
the
firm
missed
even
that
lowered
target
there
s
an
average
deficit
of
barrels
per
day
bpd
between
real
and
planned
production
so
far
this
year
according
to
one
of
the
documents
in
april
the
company
shipped
million
bpd
of
crude
and
fuels
to
its
customers
bpd
below
the
million
bpd
contracted
the
documents
show
the
firm
shorted
deliveries
to
of
major
customers
with
crude
supply
contracts
the
records
show
the
shortfall
which
has
not
been
previously
reported
shed
new
light
on
the
depth
of
the
company
s
problems
extracting
and
refining
crude
despite
repeated
promises
by
maduro
and
pdvsa
president
manuel
quevedo
to
grow
production
by
million
bpd
the
firm
in
april
had
so
little
oil
it
failed
to
deliver
almost
all
of
the
crude
it
promised
to
its
refining
unit
citgo
petroleum
under
a
contract
the
documents
show
venezuela
s
exports
of
crude
declined
percent
in
the
first
four
months
of
to
million
bpd
compared
with
million
bpd
in
the
same
period
last
year
according
to
reuters
trade
flows
data
in
crude
output
fell
to
million
bpd
the
lowest
annual
average
in
over
three
decades
aggravating
its
export
problems
conoco
last
month
started
seizing
pdvsa
s
terminals
oil
inventories
and
cargoes
in
the
caribbean
to
enforce
a
billion
arbitration
award
in
a

over
