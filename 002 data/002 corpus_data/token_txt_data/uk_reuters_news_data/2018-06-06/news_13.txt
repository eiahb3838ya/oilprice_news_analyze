oil demand could keep growing until 2050 in conflict-ridden world - equinor

global
oil
demand
could
peak
in
the
early
if
countries
pull
together
to
hit
climate
goals
or
keep
growing
until
in
a
world
according
to
norwegian
oil
and
gas
firm
equinor
expectations
for
when
oil
demand
will
peak
could
change
the
supply
dynamics
as
investors
weigh
up
whether
to
back
projects
or
to
reduce
their
risks
by
focusing
on
investments
with
more
rapid
returns
such
as
shale
oil
it
said
an
oil
market
in
potential
decline
increases
the
uncertainty
the
producers
face
reduces
their
investment
horizon
and
increases
the
focus
on
short
payback
periods
for
investments
equinor
said
in
its
new
energy
outlook
equinor
formerly
known
as
statoil
changed
its
name
on
may
to
reflect
its
strategy
of
becoming
a
broad
energy
company
it
plans
to
increase
investments
in
renewable
energy
to
percent
of
its
total
capital
expenditure
by
oil
demand
in
varies
between
million
and
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
its
three
scenarios
called
renewal
reform
and
rivalry
compared
with
million
bpd
in
the
renewal
scenario
is
consistent
with
the
goal
of
the
paris
climate
agreement
to
limit
a
rise
in
the
world
s
average
surface
temperatures
to
below
degrees
celsius
above
times
the
reform
scenario
based
on
a
continuation
of
existing
policy
and
technology
trends
sees
oil
demand
peaking
at
million
bpd
around
and
declining
to
million
bpd
in
the
geopolitical
backdrop
in
rivalry
is
a
fluid
volatile
and
world
where
a
lack
of
trust
prevents
countries
from
addressing
climate
change
effectively
the
value
proposition
of
democracy
declines
with
many
parts
of
the
world
now
ruled
by
dictators
and
autocrats
some
of
whom
are
intent
on
exporting
their
authoritarian
political
models
other
issues
than
climate
dominate
the
energy
policy
agendas
equinor
said
of
this
scenario
the
pace
of
transport
electrification
energy
efficiency
and
black
swan
events
such
as
a
commercial
breakthrough
in
nuclear
fusion
technology
a
potential
source
of
safe
and
green
energy
could
also
impact
demand
equinor
added
however
as
the
natural
decline
in
existing
production
will
likely
be
faster
than
the
decline
in
oil
demand
new
investments
will
be
need
to
close
the
gap
even
under
the
renewal
scenario
some
billion
barrels
of
oil
will
be
needed
by
from
new
sources
more
than
the
total
supply
from
opec
countries
over
the
last
years
