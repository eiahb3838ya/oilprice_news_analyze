harmonized
light

test
procedure
wltp
which
is
based
on
data
rather
than
theoretical
scenarios
would
require
a
feat
of
carmakers
are
rushing
to
get
models
through
wltp
tests
on
a
limited
number
of
exhaust
emission
test
benches
as

called
on

to
find
ways
to
cope
with
the
effects

production
disruptions
saying
they
couldn
t
be
blamed
on
staff
it
s
not
the
fault

built
too
few
test
rigs
over
the

can
suddenly
not
handle
the

volume
required
osterloh
