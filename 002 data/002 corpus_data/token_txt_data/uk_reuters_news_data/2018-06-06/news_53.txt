vienna

iran
will
not
heed
a
call
to
cooperate
more
fully
with
nuclear
inspectors
until
a
standoff
over
the
future
of
its
agreement
with
major
powers
is
resolved
its
envoy
to
the
agency
said
on
wednesday
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
which
is
policing
the
restrictions
placed
on
iran
s
activities
under
the
deal
has
said
tehran
is
implementing
its
commitments
but
also
called
for
timely
and
proactive
cooperation
on
providing
access
for
snap
inspections
iaea
chief
yukiya
amano
has
said
the
comment
is
not
an
expression
of
concern
or
complaints
but
rather
an
encouragement
to
iran
diplomats
who
deal
with
the
agency
however
say
it
follows
an
inspection
in
late
april
that
went
down
to
the
wire
in
terms
of
how
quickly
the
iaea
team
gained
access
to
one
site
tehran
s
ambassador
to
the
iaea
reza
najafi
said
that
while
it
was
not
benefiting
from
the
deal
no
one
should
expect
iran
to
go
to
implement
more
voluntary
european
powers
are
scrambling
to
salvage
the
deal
since
president
donald
trump
pulled
washington
out
last
month
and
said
he
would
reimpose
sanctions
on
iran
the
three
european
powers
that
signed
the
deal
france
britain
and
germany
are
looking
to
shield
european
companies
from
sanctions
while
also
keeping
iranian
oil
exports
and
the
revenue
from
them
flowing
najafi
would
not
be
drawn
on
exactly
how
much
longer
talks
between
the
europeans
and
iran
on
salvaging
the
deal
would
last
we
gave
a
few
weeks
to
our
european
counterparts
he
told
reporters
outside
a
quarterly
meeting
of
the
agency
s
board
of
governors
a
few
weeks
means
a
few
weeks
not
a
few
iran
s
supreme
leader
ali
khamenei
said
on
monday
he
had
ordered
that
preparations
be
made
to
increase
iran
s
uranium
enrichment
capacity
in
case
the
nuclear
deal
fell
apart
the
iaea
said
iran
had
notified
it
of
a
tentative
schedule
to
resume
production
of
uranium
hexafluoride
the
feedstock
for
centrifuges
the
machines
that
enrich
uranium
the
deal
caps
the
level
to
which
iran
can
enrich
the
gas
as
well
as
its
stock
of
the
enriched
material
but
i
should
emphasize
that
it
does
not
mean
that
right
now
iran
will
restart
any
activities
contrary
to
the
jcpoa
najafi
said
using
the
deal
s
official
name
the
joint
comprehensive
plan
of
action
these
are
only
