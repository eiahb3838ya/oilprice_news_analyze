seriti
resources
wants
to
move
into
exporting

would
be
interested
in
buying
the
assets
and
quotas
of
the
gupta
family
s
optimum
coal
its
ceo
said
bidding
for
optimum
coal
would
pit
seriti
which
has
ambitions
to
become
a
mining
champion
with
bigger
miner
exxaro

optimum

sought
protection
from
creditors
on
with

corrupt
ties
to
former
south

zuma
and
the

brothers
deny
any
wrongdoing
optimum
has
not
made
clear
if
its
assets
are
up
for
sale
but
seriti
s
ceo
and
shareholder
mike
teke
used
to
own
a
stake
in
the
company
until
glencore
bid
for
it
in
yes
i
am
interested
teke
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
a
mining
conference
in
johannesburg
i
still
believe
i
can
run
the
mine
i
still
believe
i
can
add
value
i
still
believe
i
can
change
the
bad
things
that
have
happened
at
that
seriti
already
owns
three
coal
mines
acquired
a
year
ago
from
anglo
american
in
a
million
deal
that
marked
the
first
step
in
creating
what
teke
a
former
teacher
turned
mining
boss
aims
to
become
a
publicly
traded
south
african
mining
company
seriti
is
by
four
black
anchor
shareholders
teke
s
investment
company
masimong
group
as
well
as

seriti
currently
produces
thermal
coal
for
power
stations
operated
by
south
african
utility
eskom
which
collectively
generate
about
percent
of
the
country
s
electricity
but
teke
said
it
wants
to
move
into
exporting
coal
my
vision
is
i
want
seriti
to
move
into
that
tier
where
it
s
a
mining
house
that
people
will
think
of
said
teke
a
former
chairman
of
lobby
group
chamber
of
mines
running
optimum
again
would
be
a
major
step
forward
just
like
when
you
grow
up
there
are
things
that
you
desire
in
a
toy
store
there
are
assets
i
desire
to
own
he
said
referring
to
optimum
coal
bloomberg
reports
have
suggested
that
glencore
is
also
weighing
buying
back
optimum
which
it
sold
to
oakbay
investments
owned
by
the
gupta
family
for
billion
rand
million
in
glencore
