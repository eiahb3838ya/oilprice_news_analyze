enbridge
inc
faces
an
indefinite
delay
to
its
capital
project
if
a
state
regulator
denies
its
preferred
pipeline
route
through
minnesota
but
a
victory
would
spell
relief
for
canadian
oil
shippers
and
northern
refiners
some
pipeline
opponents
which
include
environmental
and
native
american
groups
are
trying
to
convince
the
minnesota
public
utilities
commission
puc
to
kill
the
project
others
oppose
only
enbridge
s
proposed
new
pipeline
route
saying
it
would
consume
more
land
and
threaten
native
americans

enbridge
wants
to
replace
the
aging
line
pipeline
that
runs
from
alberta
to
wisconsin
worsening
bottlenecks
in
alberta
have
steepened
a
price

several

concerns
its

would
allow
it
to
return

regulatory
approval
may
be
pivotal
to
restoring
investor
confidence
in
enbridge
whose
stock
is
down

this
year
partly
on
debt
concerns
even
as
the
s
p
tsx
energy
index
is
up
slightly
the
puc
is
set
to
decide
late
this
month
whether
the
total
billion
project
is
necessary
and
if
so
what
route
it
should
take
an
administrative
law
judge
recommended
in
april
the
expanded
pipeline
should
follow
the
existing
route
enbridge
prefers
a
new
route
that
bypasses
an
indigenous
reservation
avoids
some
ecologically
sensitive
areas
and
prevents
a
pipeline
shutdown
of
up
to
one
year
it
hopes
to
start
construction
in
minnesota
in
november
a
different
route
would
require
a
detailed
evaluation
that
would
set
back
plans
to
start
the
added
oil
flow
by
late
said
guy
jarvis
enbridge
s
executive
of
liquids
pipelines
and
major
projects
a
ruling
by
the
puc
of
anything
other
than
our
preferred
route
is
clearly
going
to
put
the
timeline
for
this
project
in
jeopardy
he
told
reuters
in
an
interview
the
late
stages
of
enbridge
s
outreach
effort
will
marshal
minnesota
s
refiners
business
and
labour
groups
to
lobby
state
legislators
and
other
influencers
for
the
project
jarvis
said
to
those
groups
line
means
a
billion
investment
in
the
state
more
jobs
and
less
crude
travelling
by
rail
it
s
a
press
jarvis
said
they
can
carry
the
message
of
what
it
means
in
minnesota
better
than
we
for
flint

a

line
is
critical
to
supplying
its
minnesota
refinery
with
adequate

of
canadian

said

hopes
to

minnesota
gov
mark
dayton
to
help
kill
the

the

has
no
formal

in
the

deliberations
but
carries
valuable
influence
said
tara
houska
national

director
for
honor
the

the
state
commerce
department
has
already
said
enbridge
has
not
shown
the

is
needed
a
spokesperson
for
dayton
said
the
governor
has
made
clear
that
the
puc
operates
independently
of
his
administration
last
month
dayton
vetoed
a
bill
that
would
have
allowed
enbridge
to
bypass
the

the

argues
that
expanding
the
pipeline
tramples
on
tribal
rights
to
harvest
wild
rice
hunt
and
fish
in
the
area
the
wild
rice
issue
is
critical
to
this
decision

the

enbridge
spokeswoman
suzanne
wilton
said
the
canadian
oil
industry
faces
opposition
to
other
pipeline
projects
and
views
approval
for
this
one
as
a
badly
needed
victory
it
s
very
important
for
the
industry
to
prove
they
can
not
only
get
lines
built
but
lines
increased
said
kevin
brent
of

at
bluesky
equities
which
owns
enbridge
stock
a
loss
in
minnesota
would
be
terrible
for
