schlumberger
nv
and
halliburton
co
are
preparing
offers
for
an
onshore
production
sharing
deal
with
brazil
s
petrobras
two
sources
said
a
first
for
oil
services
firms
in
the
latin
american
country
another
source
said
general
electric
co
s
unit
baker
hughes
is
also
studying
a
potential
bid
for
the
tender
launched
by
petrobras
in
may
a
deal
would
represent
a
novel
way
for
the
oil
company
to
boost
output
from
mature
fields
without
losing
control
or
risking
capital
by
partnering
with
one
of
the
world
s
largest
oil
service
providers
such
a
deal
would
also
allow
oil
services
companies
to
put
to
use
expensive
equipment
idled
for
years
during
the
downturn
in
brazil
s
oil
industry
hammered
by
low
oil
prices
and
a
massive
corruption
scandal
at
petrobras
south
america
s
largest
producer
has
attracted
billions
of
dollars
of
investment
from
the
world
s
top
oil
firms
to
develop
prolific
deep
water
oilfields
the
tender
or
invitation
to
bid
was
addressed
to
the
world
s
three
top
oil
services
companies
the
three
people
said
the
firms
would
compete
by
promising
to
boost
production
from
the
potiguar
basin
s
waning
canto
do
amaro
field
where
production
began
in
and
offering
a
bigger
share
of
output
to
petrobras
they
added
under
the
contract
the
winner
would
provide
capital
to
drill
new
wells
in
the
area
located
in
the
coastal
state
of
rio
grande
do
norte
in
northern
brazil
two
people
said
bids
are
due
this
month
but
at
least
one
of
the
companies
has
asked
for
an
extension
a
person
said
talks
to
reach
such
a
deal
were
more
than
a
year
in
the
making
people
said
spokespeople
for
baker
hughes
schlumberger
halliburton
and
petrobras
declined
to
comment
production
sharing
deals
are
usually
made
by
oil
producers
rather
than
oil
service
firms
oilfield
service
companies
engaging
in
activities
can
be
seen
as
competing
with
customers
and
also
expose
themselves
to
more
risk
from
swings
in
oil
prices
the
may
tender
was
not
petrobras
s
only
bid
to
boost
output
from
mature
fields
last
year
norway
s
equinor
formerly
statoil
paid
up
to
billion
for
a
percent
stake
in
petrobras
s
roncador
one
of
brazil
s
largest
oilfields
in
the
campos
basin
but
potiguar
basin
limited
output
would
be
unlikely
to
draw
interest
from
such
oil
majors
schlumberger
the
world
s
largest
oilfield
service
firm
has
used
similar
deal
structures
elsewhere
through
its
production
management
group
in
some
cases
financing
projects
in
exchange
for
full
service
rights
and
a
share
of
profits
this
has
taken
the
firm
away
from
its
traditional
oil
service
business
model
the
firm
s
production
management
unit
has
had
varying
degrees
of
success
buying
stakes
in
oil
fields
and
in
production
sharing
models
on
at
least
one
deal
in
the
shale
patch
it
had
to
write
off
millions
of
dollars
in
losses
and
it
has
also
faced
payment
issues
for
a
project
in
ecuador
schlumberger
executives
have
said
this
year
that
the
firm
was
slowing
project
approval
for
the
group
clinching
such
a
deal
would
however
represent
a
bigger
milestone
for
halliburton
and
ge
s
baker
hughes
which
have
not
typically
taken
stakes
in
customer
projects
still
baker
hughes
last
year
announced
a
deal
with
twinza
oil
limited
to
provide
a
range
of
services
for
the
development
of
an
offshore
gas
field
in
papua
new
guinea
and
provide
a
credit
line
to
fund
appraisal
of
the
field
and
halliburton
signed
a
deal
in
mexico
s
chicontepec
basin
five
years
ago
