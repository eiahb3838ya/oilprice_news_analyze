global solar forecasts lowered as china cuts support policies
reuters
china
s
unexpected
move
to
slash
incentives
for
solar
power
has
sent
stocks
into
a
free
fall
and
prompted
analysts
to
lower
forecasts
for
global
installations
this
year
amid
expectations
that
a
glut
of
excess
panels
would
send
prices
tumbling
china
announced
on
june
changes
to
the
subsidies
that
has
underpinned
its
rise
to
become
the
world
s
largest
solar
market
in
recent
years
ihs
markit
a
market
research
firm
was
preparing
to
lower
its
global
solar
installation
forecast
for
this
year
by
between
and
gigawatts
or
up
to
percent
analyst
camron
barati
said
the
impact
in
china
which
accounts
for
half
the
global
market
could
be
up
to
gw
the
firm
said
another
market
research
firm
wood
mackenzie
said
on
wednesday
that
china
s
capacity
additions
would
likely
be
about
gw
lower
than
it
had
expected
an
oversupply
of
cheap
panels
that
had
been
destined
for
domestic
projects
will
help
boost
demand
for
solar
in
other
countries
and
sop
up
some
of
the
demand
lost
in
china
ihs
said
but
a
drop
in
prices
will
leave
manufacturers
with
margins
as
they
seek
to
unload
their
products
there
will
be
a
stressful
environment
for
pricing
in
the
near
term
barati
said
something
like
this
certainly
has
global
in
april
ihs
markit
forecast
global
installations
would
hit
a
record
gw
with
gw
coming
from
china
alone
china
is
also
the
world
s
largest
producer
of
solar
panels
but
the
asian
nation
last
week
said
it
would
not
build
any
more
solar
power
stations
in
and
cut
its
tariff
subsidy
which
guarantees
a
certain
price
for
power
solar
investors
reacted
by
selling
off
stocks
the
mac
global
solar

is
down

analyst
joe
osha
slashed
his
rating
on
first
solar
shares
to
underperform
on
wednesday
and
cut
his
price
target
to
from
the
trump
administration

percent
tariffs
on
solar
imports
will
help
support

osha
said
