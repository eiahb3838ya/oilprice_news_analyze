stepping
up

and
technological
will
allow
it
to
take
share
from
rivals
even
as
recycling
regulations
bite
however
shares

rpc
were
set
for
their
worst
day
in

s
in

one

newly

packaging
markets
are
going

tighter
regulation
looms
in
europe
and
elsewhere
rpc
said
none
of
the
products
it
makes
will
be
restricted
by
a
planned
european

directive
or
british
restrictions
on

use
plastics
and
that
little
immediate
impact
was
anticipated
rpc
chairman
james
pike
added
that
customers
were
not
moving
away
from
plastic
but
were
showing
increasing
interest
in
recyclable
products
playing
to
its
design
strengths
among
other
projects

is
investing

billion
pounds
on
acquisitions
in
the
