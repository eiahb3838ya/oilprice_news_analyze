wales
has
offered
million
pounds
million
in
funding
to
help
build
the
swansea
bay
tidal
lagoon
ahead
of
a
uk
government
decision
on
whether
to
fund
the
billion
pound
renewable
energy
project
britain
is
considering
building
what
would
be
the
world
s
first
such
project
a
km
mile
sea
wall
to
capture
tidal
power
in
part
to
replace
aging
coal
and
nuclear
plants
set
to
close
in
the
as
well
as
cut
carbon
emissions
but
the
project
s
costs
have
cast
doubt
on
its
viability
despite
the
backing
of
an
independent
review
last
year
carried
out
by
former
energy
minister
charles
hendry
the
offer
to
provide
a
loan
or
to
take
an
equity
stake
came
from
the
welsh
assembly
and
was
made
by
wales
first
minister
carwyn
jones
in
a
letter
to
british
business
minister
greg
clark
it
also
called
for
a
minimum
price
guarantee
for
the
electricity
the
project
produces
of
pounds
per
megawatt

the
same
as
that
awarded

said
it
hoped
the
uk
government
would
look
positively
on
the
proposed
joint
funding
deal
the
proposal
for
a
joint
deal
with
this
structure
is
extremely
constructive
we
are
eager
to
engage
on
it
with
all
parties
and
it
is
a
proposal
we
d
be
delighted
to
take

chairman
keith
clarke
said
in
a
statement
the
project
in
south
wales
was
due
to
start
construction
in
and
is
expected
to
take
four
years
to
complete
when
the
tide
drops
the
difference
between
water
levels
inside
and
outside
the
lagoon
causes
water
to
pass
through
turbines
to
produce
electricity
similarly
when
the
tide
rises
power
would
be
generated
as
water
fills
the
lagoon
while
tidal
changes
have
been
harnessed
before
to
generate
power
mostly
deploying
a
barrage
across
a
stretch
of
water
this
would
be
the
first
to
enclose
it
effectively
creating
a
lagoon
