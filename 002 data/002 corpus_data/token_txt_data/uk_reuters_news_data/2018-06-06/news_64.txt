liquefied
natural

facility
in
the
eastern
united
states
will
undergo
a
brief
maintenance
shutdown
in
the
autumn
the
company
s
top
executive
said
on
wednesday
it
s
not
very
long
dominion
s
chief
executive
officer
thomas
farrell
said
in
an
interview
adding
the
outage
could
be
for
less
than
a
few
weeks
asked
whether
there
would
be
any
interruption
in
lng
exports
from
the
site
on
the
coast
of
the
state
of
maryland
farrell
said
that
would
depend
on
whether
gas
storage
tanks
with
capacity
to
hold
nearly
billion
cubic
feet
of
the
commodity
were
exhausted
farrell
was
in
yokohama
to
attend
a
ceremony
to
celebrate
last
month
s
start
of
japanese
imports
of
cove
point
lng
and
the
arrival
of
a
second
cove
point
lng
vessel
at
a
tokyo
gas
terminal
on
wednesday
morning
the
imports
via
a
contract
mark
a
shift
in
global
energy
flows
as
the
united
states
boosts
oil
and
gas
exports
from
shale
formations
a
of
goods
purchases
by
japan
may
draw
some
of
the
sting
from
president
donald
trump
s
criticisms
of
the
asian
nation
s
trade
imbalance
with
the
united
states
the
cove
point
facility
with
a
nameplate
annual
capacity
of
million
tonnes
of
lng
has
been
at
full
production
of
lng
from
natural
gas
since
april
farrell
said
you
ll
see
a
very
significant
increase
in
natural
gas
coming
to
asia
and
in
particular
japan
he
said
shale
drilling
techniques
have
unlocked
probably
years
of
natural
gas
that
we
will
be
exporting
toward
our
allies
across
the
world
for
decades
and
dominion
sold
the
project
s
capacity
for
years
to
a
subsidiary
of
gail
india
and
to
st
cove
point
a
joint
venture
between
units
of
japanese
trading
company
sumitomo
corp
and
tokyo
gas
tokyo
gas
has
a
contract
to
buy
million
tonnes
a
year
of
cove
point
lng
for
years
while
kansai
electric
power
has
contracted
to
take
tonnes
a
year
there
are
no
plans
to
build
additional
trains
at
the
cove
point
terminal
because
there
is
no
land
available
farrell
added
asked
whether
there
are
any
plans
for
similar
lng
export
projects
elsewhere
he
said
that
s
possible
but
that
would
be
in
the
future
we
don
t
have
any
present
plans
to
do
that
