saudi
arabia
s
decision
to
increase
the
price
of
oil
for
july
modestly
for
its
major
customers
in
asia
was
a
outcome
rather
than
any
signal
that
the
kingdom
intends
to
produce
and
sell
more
crude
saudi
aramco
the
world
s
biggest
crude
exporter
raised
its
official
selling
prices
osps
for
four
of
its
five
grades
for
july
cargoes
to
asia
including
a
cent
a
barrel
increase
for
the
benchmark
arab
light
this
took
the
premium
for
arab
light
to
a
barrel
over
regional
benchmark
the
highest
in
four
years
the
increase
in
the
osp
for
arab
light
was
smack
in
the
middle
of
the
range
expected
by
asian
refiners
surveyed
by
reuters
ahead
of
the
announcement
the
decision
appears
to
reflect
recent
price
dynamics
in
the
market
where
the
backwardation
between
the
first
and
third
months
has
widened
in
other
words
the
saudis
did
what
was
expected
with
the
setting
of
the
osps
for
july
cargoes
that
may
sound
like
a
boring
outcome
but
still
speaks
volumes
for
how
they
view
the
current
state
of
the
market
saudi
arabia
and
fellow
producers
in
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
as
well
as
their
allies
in
a
broad
deal
to
cut
output
have
come
under
pressure
recently
from
the
united
states
over
rising
oil
prices
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
has
unofficially
requested
that
the
saudis
and
other
producers
raise
crude
output
in
order
to
cap
prices
according
to
three
opec
and
industry
sources
brent
crude
futures
briefly
popped
above
a
barrel
last
month
the
highest
level
since
november
although
they
have
since
retreated
somewhat
closing
at
on
tuesday
part
of
the
reason
for
the
recent
jump
in
crude
prices
was
the
decision
by
trump
to
withdraw
the
united
states
from
the
international
agreement
with
iran
to
limit
the
islamic
republic
s
nuclear
programme
at
the
time
of
the
announcement
last
month
the
trump
administration
said
some
countries
were
willing
to
increase
output
in
order
to
compensate
for
any
lost
iranian
barrels
as
the
united
states
reimposes
sanctions
while
it
may
well
be
the
case
that
the
saudis
and
others
are
willing
to
boost
production
and
exports
the
osps
would
seem
to
indicate
that
this
isn
t
exactly
a
huge
priority
if
the
saudis
had
wanted
to
send
a
clear
signal
to
the
market
they
could
have
cut
the
osps
that
would
have
encouraged
asian
refiners
who
take
about
of
the
kingdom
s
exports
to
buy
more
than
their
term
allocations
instead
by
meeting
market
expectations
on
pricing
the
saudis
seem
to
be
indicating
they
are
satisfied
with
the
current
state
of
the
market
their
level
of
exports
and
the
price
they
are
receiving
and
the
saudis
may
well
have
cause
to
be
satisfied
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
oil
research
and
forecasts
suggests
they
had
a
good
month
in
may
for
exports
to
china
the
world
s
biggest
crude
importer
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
saudi
crude
were
discharged
in
china
in
may
the
biggest
month
since
february
according
to
data
the
strong
chinese
imports
of
saudi
crude
came
even
as
the
country
s
top
refiner
sinopec
had
indicated
it
would
buy
less
saudi
crude
over
dissatisfaction
at
increases
in
the
saudi
osps
that
the
refiner
thought
weren
t
justified
by
market
fundamentals
for
the
saudis
the
crude
oil
market
may
well
be
in
something
of
a
sweet
spot
with
prices
some
percent
higher
than
a
year
earlier
and
solid
demand
from
major
importers
additionally
they
are
receiving
help
from
the
united
states
in
combating
their
major
regional
rival
iran
and
once
again
they
have
shown
the
market
that
opec
is
still
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
the
real
challenge
will
be
keeping
all
these
different
balls
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
a
juggling
act
that
will
be
difficult
to
sustain
if
history
is
any
guide
