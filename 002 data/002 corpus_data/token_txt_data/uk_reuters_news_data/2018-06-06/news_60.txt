the
euro
rose
to
a
high
on
wednesday
after
hawkish
comments
from
the
european
central
bank
adding
upward
pressure
to
bond
yields
and
sinking
some
stocks
as
worries
over
italy
also
weighed
robust
growth
is
making
the
central
bank
increasingly
confident
that
inflation
is
on
its
way
back
to
target
ecb
chief
economist
peter
praet
said
on
wednesday
increasing
the
likelihood
it
may
use
a
meeting
next
week
to
reveal
more
about
the
end
of
its
programme
praet
s
comments
supported
the

the

a
major
worry
for

over

conflict

paul
donovan
chief

at

global
wealth
management
we
believe
the
bond
buying
programme
will
conclude
by
the
end
of
this
msci
s
world
equity
index
which

was
up

mainly
as

of
a
strong

the
euro
s
rise
put
pressure
on
the

index
that
measures
performance
against
six
major
currencies
with
the
main
weighting
given
to
the
euro
the

fell

the
mexican
peso
steadied
on
wednesday
after
falling
to
its
weakest
since
february
late
on
tuesday
after
the
united
states
raised
the
possibility
of
turning
negotiations
over
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
into
bilateral
talks
trump
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
also
revived
the
possibility
that
the
president
will
seek
to
replace
nafta
with
bilateral
deals
with
canada
and
mexico
the
threat
of
rising
trade
protectionism
has
already
taken
a
toll
on
global
trade
and
could
increase
risks
to
growth

analysts
daniel
been
and
giulia
lavinia
specchia
said
in
a
note
against
this
backdrop
we
believe
financial
markets
will
become
even
more
sensitive
to
bad
news

raised
the
prospect
