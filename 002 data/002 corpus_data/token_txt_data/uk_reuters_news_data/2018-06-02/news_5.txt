nat

worries
about
the
spirits
of
her
ancestors
they
have
been
lying
in
watery
graves
since
cambodia
s
newest
hydroelectric
dam
flooded
her
village
of
srekor
and
with
it
the
nearby
burial
ground
we
don
t
know
whether
they
can
swim
or
not
she
said
sitting
under
a
wooden
house
on
stilts
near
the
dam
s
reservoir
nat
sota
has
earthly
concerns
too
only
the
red
roof
of
the
village
primary
school
is
now
visible
above
the
water
and
she
worries
for
her
two
young
grandchildren
if
they
are
unable
to
get
an
education
she
is
among
of
the
village
s
ethnic
kreung
bunong
and
lao
minority
families
who
have
refused
the
government
s
offer
to
move
them
to
a
village
instead
they
have
decamped
to
a
settlement
near
the
reservoir
that
flooded
their
homes
and
are
now
stuck
in
limbo
they
say
the
government
s
proposed
site
to
is
too
far
from
the
sesan
river
where
their
people
have
fished
for
generations
and
the
cash
offer
not
enough
to
cover
the
loss
of
property
and
crops
the
plight
of
this
community
in
a
remote
corner
of
northern
stung
treng
province
highlights
the
human
cost
of
cambodia
s
push
to
bring
power
to
the
entire
country
by
all
villages
have
to
have
access
to
the
electricity
supply
said
victor
jona
a
spokesman
for
the
department
of
energy
at
the
ministry
of
mines
and
energy
the
southeast
asian
nation
is
well
on
its
way
according
to
world
bank
statistics
in
only
percent
of
cambodians
had
access
to
electricity
that
increased
to
percent
by
and
almost
half
the
population
was
connected
to
the
grid
by
much
of
that
progress
has
been
driven
by
dams
between
and
hydropower
s
contribution
to
the
energy
mix
jumped
from
to
percent
the
world
bank
said
cambodia
is
considering
two
new
dams
both
of
which
would
dwarf
the
lower
sesan
in
terms
of
size
and
output
as
well
as
the
impact
on
land
and
fisheries
the
government
has
provided
fair
compensation
to
those
who
had
to
make
way
for
seven
dams
built
so
far
jona
said
citing
the
lower
sesan
as
a
good
he
noted
that
most
of
the
families
in
villages
affected
by
the
dam
have
relocated
to
new
sites
where
authorities
have
built
schools
and
health
centres
as
well
as
providing
houses
and
farmland
some
people
are
not
happy
with
the
compensation
he
conceded
in
a
letter
to
provincial
authorities
the
families
holding
out
in
srekor
asked
the
government
to
recognise
their
new
settlement
as
an
indigenous
community
with
rights
to
the
land
the
government
should
provide
cash
compensation
for
their
lost
homes
and
crops
they
said
and
build
infrastructure
including
a
well
school
and
a
health
centre
the
villagers
said
they
stayed
in
their
homes
until
rising
waters
forced
them
to
move
in
december
the
reservoir
had
begun
filling
up
in
late
september
when
the
lower
sesan
dam
s
floodgates
were
closed
underscoring
its
importance
to
cambodia
s
power
plan
prime
minister
hun
sen
inaugurated
the
project
dismissing
the
concerns
of
radical
environmentalists
in
his
speech
the
dam
will
be
running
at
full
capacity
by
the
end
of
the
year
said
jona
with
eight
turbines
producing
a
total
megawatts
mw
of
electricity
the
project
generated
controversy
even
before
its
approval
in
many
of
the
people
in
six
villages
in
the
reservoir
area
protested
and
environmentalists
predicted
a
devastating
impact
on
fisheries
a
study
in
the
journal
proceedings
of
the
national
academy
of
sciences
predicted
that
the
lower
sesan
dam
alone
would
cause
a
percent
drop
in
fish
biomass
throughout
the
mekong
river
basin
the
mekong
basin
is
the
biggest
inland
fishery
in
the
world
said
the
study
but
dams
block
migration
preventing
some
fish
from
reaching
areas
where
they
feed
and
spawn
villagers
in
srekor
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
that
one
species
of
fish
has
already
disappeared
two
more
hydropower
projects
under
consideration
would
have
an
even
greater
impact
according
to
two
different
assessments
the
sambor
dam
proposed
by
the
government
of
cambodia
is
probably
the
largest
and
most
destructive
dam
in
the
mekong
river
basin
according
to
the
natural
heritage
institute
a
conservation
group
that
assessed
the
project
for
the
government
the
mw
dam
across
the
mekong
would
be
km
wide
m
yards
high
and
create
a
reservoir
km
long
it
would
be
devastating
for
migratory
fish
stocks
said
the
upriver
from
sambor
the
proposed
mw
stung
treng
dam
would
inundate
villages
that
are
home
to
people
according
to
the
mekong
river
commission
which
is
comprised
of
the
four
countries
overseeing
the
river
s
development
jona
said
the
government
is
now
focused
on
constructing
power
plants
and
has
not
yet
decided
whether
to
build
more
hydroelectric
dams
the
dams
represent
an
existential
question
for
cambodia
in
its
quest
to
electrify
are
the
benefits
worth
the
costs
in
the
case
of
the
lower
sesan
dam
the
government
answered
yes
normally
when
we
do
a
project
this
size
development
has
to
be
balanced
between
environmental
and
social
concerns
said
jona
but
for
some
like
kheun
fut
who
refused
to
relocate
and
instead
built
a
new
house
on
high
ground
just
metres
from
the
reservoir
s
edge
the
cost
of
leaving
was
too
high
he
guided
a
motorised
canoe
through
the
ghostly
remains
of
his
village
stopping
to
speak
with
his
father
who
was
salvaging
the
roof
of
his
former
home
i
had
a
big
house
but
now
i
ve
lost
it
said
noy
fut
as
he
pried
corrugated
metal
sheets
from
the
rafters
kheun
fut
used
a
paddle
to
push
off
from
the
submerged
building
and
headed
back
to
shore
steering
between
tree
tops
and
past
the
red
and
gold
roof
of
the
village
s
buddhist
pagoda
this
is
development
he
said
the
canoe
leaving
a
murky
wake
behind
him
