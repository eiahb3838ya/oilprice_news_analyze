maintain
the
economic
policy
that
took
the

once
again
one

a
company
source
and
a
person
close
to
the
government
said
in
it
parente
said
he
was
leaving
because
he
would
not
be
an
obstacle
to
new
pricing
policies
that
might
be
necessary
to
shield
brazilian
consumers
from
volatility
in
world
oil
prices
during
the
company
posted
about
billion
in
refining
losses
due
to
unprofitable

prices
imposed
by
the
according
to
moody
s
a
key
plank
of
parente
s
turnaround
campaign
for
the
company
and
a
condition
for
his
taking
the
top
job
in
was
freedom
to
control
fuel
prices
he
sought
to
align
those
more
closely
with
international
markets
through
nearly
daily
price
adjustments
but
on
sunday
temer
governing
with
approval
ratings
announced
plans
to
placate
striking
truck
drivers
protesting
the
high
cost
of
diesel
by
freezing
fuel
prices
on
a
monthly
basis
and
taking
other
measures
to
bring
domestic
diesel
prices
down
late
on
friday
brazil
s
mines
and
energy
ministry
said
it
wanted
to
create
a
pricing
mechanism
that
would
protect
consumers
without
impacting
the
policies
of
petrobras
and
other
energy
companies
although
temer
promised
the
government
would
compensate
petrobras
for
losses
incurred
by
its
intervention
on
fuel
prices
sunday
s
move
crossed
parente
s
red
line
against
political
meddling
sources
said
one
source
close
to
parente
said
the
had
stepped
down
because
he
had
reached
his
limit
with
government
interference
another
source
close
to
temer
said
the
president
was
surprised
by
the
resignation
and
had
not
sought
to
push
the
ceo
out
parente
s
departure
comes
days
before
brazil
hopes
to
attract
foreign
oil
companies
to
bid
on
oil
fields
in
its
coveted
presalt
exploration
areas
and
leaves
in
limbo
several
of
his
key
priorities
including
selling
major
refineries
also
unresolved
is
a
dispute
with
the
government
over
an
offshore
area
which
could
represent
a
windfall
for
petrobras
if
a
deal
is
reached
parente
s
policies
had
helped
pushed
petrobras
shares
to
a
multiyear
peak
just
last
month
but
a
rise
in
international
oil
prices
triggered
anger
at
brazilian
gas
stations
and
led
to
calls
from
politicians
and
unions
for
the
executive
to
go
the
company
risks
becoming
a
political
football
in
october
s
presidential
election
with
candidate
jair
bolsonaro
s
key
economic
adviser
calling
for
its
privatisation
while
leftist
ciro
gomes
has
warned
investors
to
avoid
state
energy
sector
assets
because
he
would
expropriate
them
while
investors
and
oil
industry
insiders
bemoaned
parente
s
departure
others
rejoiced
parente
was
the
most
responsible
for
the
crisis
that
brazil
has
faced
with
the
trucker
strike
the
truckers
lobby
said
in
a
statement
nothing
justifies
the
abusive
diesel
prices
put
in
place
by
the
company
in
the
last
few
petrobras
oil
workers
who
walked
off
the
job
earlier
week
in
part
to
demand
parente
s
dismissal
also
celebrated
you
don
t
deserve
to
walk
through
the
doors
of
petrobras
again
said
jose
maria
rangel
leader
of
fup
brazil
s
largest
oil
workers
union
in
a
video
message
parente
s
policies
had
ultimately
made
him
the
scapegoat
of
the
truckers
strike
and
its
fallout
said
roberto
castello
branco
a
former
petrobras
board
member
the
pressure
on
him
was
enormous
he
said
for
the
country
for
the
company
a
great
source
of
uncertainty
has
opened
that
is
very
dangerous
