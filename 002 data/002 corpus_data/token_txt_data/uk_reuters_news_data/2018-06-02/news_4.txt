hawaii volcano eruption enters new phase as crater falls quiet
reuters
as
lava
continued
to
pour
vigorously
from
the
ground
through
fissures
at
the
foot
of
kilauea
volcano
the
eruption
on
hawaii
s
big
island
has
entered
a
new
seemingly
calmer
phase
inside
the
summit
crater
government
scientists
said
on
friday
but
vulcanologists
monitoring
and
measuring
kilauea
s
every
move
during
the
past
four
weeks
hastened
to
add
the
latest
change
in
the
volcano
s
behaviour
while
undoubtedly
significant
leaves
them
uncertain
about
what
will
follow
the
summit
crater
which
began
ejecting
ash
and
volcanic
rock
in
periodic
daily
eruptions
in
has
largely
fallen
quiet
since
wednesday
kyle
anderson
a
geological
survey
usgs
geophysicist
told
reporters
in
a
conference
call
the
apparent
reason
newly
revealed
in
footage
recorded
by
drone
aircraft
flown
over
the
summit
is
that
tons
of
rocky
material
shaken
loose
from
the
inside
walls
of
the
crater
vent
have
plugged
up
the
bottom
of
the
void
anderson
said
what
happens
next
is
unknown
it
s
possible
that
new
explosions
will
blast
through
the
rubble
at
the
bottom
of
the
vent
and
these
may
or
may
not
be
larger
than
previous
explosions
he
said
it
s
also
possible
that
the
vent
could
become
permanently
blocked
ending
the
explosions
in
any
case
the
volcano
s
behaviour
ultimately
hinges
on
the
ebb
and
flow
of
huge
rivers
of
molten
rock
called
magma
the
term
for
lava
while
it
remains
underground
the
steady
collapse
of
the
crater
s
inner
walls
caused
by
magma
draining
out
of
the
summit
and
oozing
downslope
under
the
volcano
s
surface
has
also
greatly
enlarged
the
mouth
of
the
vent
which
has
grown
in
size
from
about
acres
hectares
to
acres
hectares
anderson
said
at
the
same
time
the
kilauea
summit
itself
has
sunken
or
subsided
by
at
least
feet
meters
in
elevation
as
the
magma
level
continues
to
drop
exerting
tremendous
pressure
on
seismic
faults
to
create
numerous
earthquakes
mostly
small
tremors
in
the
immediate
vicinity
although
the
summit
crater
of
kilauea
has
fallen
silent
for
the
moment
many
of
the
two
dozen
volcanic
fissures
running
through
populated
areas
on
its
eastern
flank
continued
to
spout
and
ooze
lava
and
toxic
gases
that
prompted
the
evacuation
of
some
residents
at
least
homes
most
of
them
in
the
community
of
leilani
estates
have
been
devoured
by
streams
of
molten
rock
creeping
across
the
landscape
since
may
lava
flows
also
have
knocked
out
power
and
telephone
lines
in
the
region
disrupting
communications
another
issue
has
been
the
occurrence
of
a
phenomenon
called
pele
s
hair
fine
fibres
of
volcanic
material
produced
by
fountains
of
lava
and
carried
aloft
by
the
wind
the
filament
named
for
the
mythical
goddess
of
volcanoes
can
cause
skin
eye
and
respiratory
irritation
like
fibreglass
residents
have
been
warned
to
avoid
exposure
to
pele
s
hair
one
of
several
airborne
volcano
hazards
including
emissions
of
sulphur
dioxide
gas
ash
and
noxious
clouds
of
laze
a
term
combining
the
words
lava
and
haze
formed
when
lava
reacts
with
seawater
to
form
a
mix
of
acid
fumes
steam
and
specks
the
latest
upheaval
of
kilauea
one
of
the
world
s
most
active
volcanoes
comes
on
the
heels
of
an
earlier
eruption
cycle
that
began
in
and
continued
almost
nonstop
for
years
destroying
dwellings
and
other
structures
