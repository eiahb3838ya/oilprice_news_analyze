seeking
damages
from

purchased
vw
diesel
vehicles
which
now
face
bans
in
cities
like
stuttgart
frankfurter
allgemeine
zeitung
said
on
saturday
the
value
of
diesel
cars
plummeted
after
german
environmental
groups
scored
a
court
victory
last
year
that
forced
cities
to
consider
bans
of
older
diesel
vehicles
to
bring
emissions
into
line
with
european
union
clean
air
rules
the
faz
daily
said
state
authorities
filed
a
lawsuit
with
a
court
in
stuttgart
at
the
end
of
last
year
seeking
damages
totalling
low
double
digit
millions
volkswagen
could
not
confirm
this
and
told
reuters
the
company
had
not
seen
the
particular
lawsuit
but
it
added
that
previous
court
decisions
had
backed
its
stance
that
legal
actions
to
seek
damages
are
without
merit
given
that
vw
cars
had
valid
road
certification
at
the
time
of
sale
officials
at
state
could
not
be
immediately
reached
for
comment
the
paper

taxpayer
money
had
been
spent
on
buying
and
leasing
diesel
vehicles
for
the
police
service
it
did
not
specify
how
had
lost
money
regulators
in
blew
the
whistle
on
volkswagen
s
systematic
emissions
test
cheating
which
revealed
that
the
carmaker
s
vehicles
emitted
far
higher
levels
of
nitrogen
oxide
pollution
than
permitted
by
the
law
a
global
clampdown
on
pollution
ensued
prompting
regulators
and
environmental
groups
in
germany
to
scrutinise
emissions
unlike
in
the
united
states
older
vw
cars
have
not
been
found
to
be
illegal
in
germany
after
the
carmaker
agreed
recall
its
vehicles
to
modify
