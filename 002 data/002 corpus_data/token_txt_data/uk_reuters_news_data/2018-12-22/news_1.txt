china
s
carbon
industry
will
face
severe
overcapacity
from
the
of
after
producers
rushed
to
expand
capacity
amid
fat
an
official
from
the
china
carbon
industry
association
ccia
said
on
saturday
carbon
products
are
widely
used
in
sectors
such
as
metallurgy
chemicals
aviation
and
renewable
energy
due
to
their
strong
resistance
to
corrosion
and
good
conductivity
extravagant
profits
have
lured
companies
who
shut
down
in
bleak
years
to
resume
operations
and
even
expand
capacity

conference
meanwhile
some
who
don

have
carbon
capacity
are
planning
to
launch
new
production
beijing
s
aggressive
environmental
protection
campaign
has
tightened
supplies
of
carbon
products
but
has
also
boosted
demand
for
products
such
as
graphite
electrodes
used
to
melt
scrap
in
electric
arc
furnaces

less

china
s
biggest
producers
of
graphite
electrodes
surged
percent
in
from
the
year
before
to
billion
yuan
million
while
average
in
the
chinese
carbon
industry
last
year
jumped
more
than
percent
according
to
ccia
data
china
is
expected
to
have
graphite
electrode
capacity
totalling
million
tonnes
by
up
percent
from
tonnes
in
said

that
will
exceed
demand
of
less
than
tonnes

a
raw

used
at
aluminium
smelters
will
also
see
a
glut
in
supply
with
redundant
capacity
set
to
reach
million
tonnes
in
before
climbing
more
in
the
coming
three
years
according
to
sun
unlike
china
s
steel
and
coal
industry
whose
capacity
is
strict
controlled
by
the
central
government
carbon
producers
do
not
need
to
acquire
approvals
from
authorities
to
add
new
capacity
as
long
as
they
are
able
to
meet
environmental
standards
however
despite
the
capacity
expansion
china
will
still
face
tight
supply
of
carbon
products
such
as
which
is
used
to
make
batteries
carbon
makers
must
not
only
focus
on
interest
and
blindly
expanding
capacity
but
should
seize
this
rare
opportunity
to
improve
technology
and
upgrade
their
products
