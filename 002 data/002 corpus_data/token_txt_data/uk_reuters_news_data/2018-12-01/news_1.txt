violent
and
groups
had
infiltrated
the
yellow

movement
interior

castaner
said
most
of
those
arrested
were
regular
protesters
who
had
been
egged
on
by
the
fringe
groups
the
protests
began
as
a
backlash
against
macron
s
fuel
tax
hikes
but
have
tapped
into
a
vein
of
deep
dissatisfaction
felt
towards
the
s
economic
reforms
which
many
voters
feel
favour
the
wealthy
and
big
business
unrest
erupted
in

and
cities
across

from
charleville
mezieres
in
the

was
set
on

the
protests
are
taking
a
toll
on
the
economy
parts
of
central
paris
that
should
have
been
packed
with
tourists
and
christmas
shoppers
resembled
battle
zones
as

gas
hung
in
the
air
and
debris
littered
the
ground
hotels
and
department
stores
in
the
capital
stand
to
lose
millions
and
shelves
have
run
empty
in
some
supermarkets
the
protests
have
caught
macron
just
as
he
was
trying
to
counter
a
fall
in
his
popularity
rating
to
percent
his
unyielding
response
has
exposed
him
to
charges
of
being
out
of
touch
with
ordinary
people
particularly
in
rural
villages
and
the
provincial
hinterlands
some
peaceful
protesters
held
up
a
slogan
reading
macron
stop
treating
us
like
idiots
macron
on
tuesday
said
he
understood
the
anger
of
voters
outside
france
s
big
cities
over
the
squeeze
fuel
prices
have
put
on
households
but
he
insisted
he
would
not
be
bounced
into
changing
policy
by
thugs
despite
the
unrest
that
has
accompanied
the
protests
the
yellow
vests
have
widespread
public
support
even
in
cities
i
am
totally

the
