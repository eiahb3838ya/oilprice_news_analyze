global
shares
edged
down
from
their
highest
in
two
months
on
friday
as
data
showing
shrinking
factory
activity
in
china
ended
a
rally
that
took
them
to
their
best
january
on
record
stocks
have
benefited
this
week
from
the
federal
reserve
which
all
but
abandoned
plans
for
raising
interest
rates
again
and
on
optimism
that
a
trade
deal
might
be
on
the
cards
but
the
index
of
chinese
manufacturing
fell
to
its
lowest
since
february
adding

a
growing
list
of
economic

china

although

were
in
line
with
forecasts
equity
markets
have
been
relieved
by
a
change
of
heart
at
the
federal
reserve
which
signalled
this
week
that
its
drive
to
tighten
monetary
policy
may
be
at
an
end
as
the
outlook
for
the
economy
worsens
the
fed
held
rates
steady
discarded
its
promise
of
further
gradual
increases
in
rates
and
said
it
would
be
patient
before
making
any
further
moves
the
fed
decision
should
not
only
be
supportive
of
risk
markets
but
also
the
weaker
dollar
backdrop
could
be
extended
which
should
support
em
assets
especially
at
a
time
when
china
is
attempting
to
stimulate
growth
said
mohammed
kazmi
portfolio
manager
at
ubp
the
market
will
now
turn
its
attention
to
the
outcome
of
trade
talks
as
well
as
the
jobs
data
from
the
united
states
is
due
at
gmt
stocks
had
also
gained
after
president
donald
trump
said
he
would
meet
chinese
president
xi
jinping
soon
to
try
to
seal
a
comprehensive
trade
deal
the
top
negotiator
at
the
talks
reported
substantial
progress
in
the
talks
beijing
s
trade
delegation
said
they
made
important
progress
china
s
official
xinhua
news
agency
reported
the
previously
upbeat
mood
was
also
chilled
somewhat
by
white
house
insistence
that
march
was
a
hard
deadline
for
a
deal
failure
of
which
would
lead
to
an
increase
in
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
analysts
mostly
remain
deeply
sceptical
that
a
genuine
trade
deal
can
be
done
on
this
time
frame
economists
from
commonwealth
bank
of
australia
said
in
a
note
we
are
less
pessimistic
since
these
negotiations
are
being
conducted
by
senior
politicians
not
by
trade
bureaucrats
they
said
both
sides
also
have
an
incentive
and
arguably
a
growing
incentive
to
get
a
meaningful
deal
