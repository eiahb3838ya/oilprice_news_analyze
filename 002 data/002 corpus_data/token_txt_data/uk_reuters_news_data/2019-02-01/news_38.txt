insight-a climate problem even california can't fix: tailpipe pollution
los
angeles
feb
reuters
for
three
decades
california
has
led
the
fight
to
control
tailpipe
pollution
with
countless
policies
promoting
cleaner
gasoline
carpooling
public
transportation
and
its
signature
strategy
the
electric
vehicle
californians
now
buy
more
than
half
of
all
evs
sold
in
the
united
states
and
the
state
s
policies
have
provided
a
model
being
adopted
around
the
world
but
they
re
not
working
at
home
by
the
state
s
own
measure
tailpipe
pollution
here
is
going
up
not
down
despite
billions
of
dollars
spent
by
one
of
the
most
environmentally
progressive
governments
on
earth
the
strategies
that
we
ve
used
up
until
now
just
haven
t
been
effective
mary
nichols
the
head
of
the
california
air
resources
board
told
reuters
that
failure
has
less
to
do
with
energy
or
environmental
policies
and
more
with
urban
planning
decisions
that
made
california
and
especially
los
angeles
a
haven
for
sprawling
development
of
homes
and
long
commutes
according
to
state
officials
california
s
struggle
bodes
poorly
for
other
major
cities
with
similar
sprawl
and
expensive
urban
housing
such
as
houston
atlanta
and
others
that
planned
their
cities
around
cars
and
casts
doubt
on
whether
the
united
states
can
meet
its
pledged
carbon
cuts
under
an
international
agreement
to
fight
climate
change
the
state
s
troubles
also
hold
lessons
for
massive
economies
including
china
and
india
major
carbon
emitters
that
hope
to
control
pollution
from
vehicles
as
they
rapidly
urbanize
transportation
is
tied
with
power
generation
as
america
s
leading
source
of
carbon
dioxide
emissions
at
percent
according
to
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
it
takes
top
billing
in
california
at
about
percent
it
makes
up
a
smaller
share
in
the
rest
of
the
world
where
car
ownership
is
lower
but
likely
to
grow
california
s
carbon
emissions
amounted
to
million
metric
tons
in
the
last
year
for
which
data
is
available
that
s
the
lowest
level
since
thanks
to
a
shift
away
from
electricity
toward
natural
gas
solar
and
wind
but
its
next
target
calling
for
a
further
percent
cut
by
will
be
out
of
reach
without
transformative
changes
in
state
residents
driving
habits
carb
said
in
a
report
published
late
last
year
as
the
state
struggles
to
cut
its
own
vehicle
pollution
california
officials
are
also
fighting
an
effort
by
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
to
weaken
national
standards
for
automobile
emissions
a
spokesman
for
governor
gavin
newsom
who
ran
on
a
promise
to
continue
california
s
legacy
of
climate
action
did
not
return
requests
for
comment
california
s
tailpipe
emissions
have
risen
percent
since
according
to
carb
data
as
population
growth
urban
sprawl
and
a
devotion
to
one
s
own
car
produced
longer
commutes
and
choking
traffic
the
increase
came
even
as
the
state
has
finally
caught
traction
in
promoting
electric
and
hybrid
vehicles
some
million
of
which
have
been
sold
in
the
state
since
according
to
the
alliance
of
automobile
manufacturers
the
government
last
year
set
a
target
of
million
electric
vehicles
by
but
even
hitting
that
goal
by
no
means
assured
won
t
be
near
enough
to
allow
the
state
to
meet
its
goal
for
carbon
reduction
which
would
require
california
drivers
to
reduce
per
capita
miles
traveled
by
percent
carb
said
in
its
report
the
state
has
also
boosted
spending
on
public
transport
by
about
percent
over
the
past
decade
according
to
carb
but
transit
options
are
poorly
suited
for
california
s
vast
expanses
of
neighborhoods
if
we
keep
thinking
we
are
going
to
overcome
a
system
overnight
that
s
wrong
said
hasan
ikhrata
executive
director
of
the
san
diego
association
of
governments
the
city
s
main
public
planning
body
the
united
states
has
pledged
to
cut
carbon
emissions
by
between
to
percent
from
levels
by
under
the
paris
agreement
an
international
pact
to
fight
climate
change
reached
by
nearly
countries
in
while
president
donald
trump
has
signaled
his
intention
to
pull
the
united
states
out
of
the
accord
a
group
of
states
led
by
california
wants
to
ensure
the
meets
its
commitments
which
scientists
call
critical
to
avoiding
the
most
devastating
effects
of
climate
change
but
california
s
problems
and
those
of
other
sprawling
cities
suggest
that
meeting
that
goal
will
be
difficult
in
houston
for
example
tailpipe
emissions
have
soared
percent
posing
a
major
challenge
for
the
city
s
goal
of
becoming
carbon
neutral
by
unlike
california
texas
has
no
statewide
reduction
goals
and
the
state
s
love
affair
with
trucks
is
only
deepening
more
than
two
thirds
of
new
vehicles
registered
in
the
houston
area
last
year
were
pickup
trucks
or
suvs
compared
to
less
than
half
in
los
angeles
according
to
ihs
markit
a
global
financial
information
provider
electric
cars
by
comparison
represent
just
percent
of
new
vehicle
sales
in
texas
according
to
the
state
s
department
of
motor
vehicles
in
california
it
was
around
percent
in
the
first
eight
months
of
last
year
according
to
data
compiled
by
the
alliance
of
automobile
manufacturers
transportation
emissions
have
also
been
rising
in
other
major
cities
such
as
atlanta
philadelphia
and
san
antonio
according
to
city
climate
emissions
reports
from
recent
years
and
have
climbed
about
percent
nationwide
since
according
to
the
epa
other
parts
of
the
world
could
have
an
easier
time
in
europe
residents
of
densely
populated
cities
face
high
fuel
taxes
encouraging
reduced
car
travel
many
european
cities
have
seen
relatively
high
levels
of
electric
car
adoption
and
in
china
and
india
which
also
have
lofty
electric
vehicle
targets
major
cities
are
still
being
built
with
pollution
control
in
mind
they
are
much
better
able
to
bake
in
this
kind
of
planning
into
their
urban
designs
said
john
german
a
senior
fellow
with
the
international
council
on
clean
transportation
one
example
is
china
s
new
zone
of
xiongan
a
district
to
ease
overcrowding
in
beijing
which
is
being
designed
from
scratch
in
a
document
published
in
january
the
chinese
government
promised
to
incorporate
development
ideas
such
as
commuter
rail
and
efficient
land
use
into
its
planning
for
xiongan
to
create
a
convenient
safe
green
and
intelligent
transportation
system
china
is
also
seeking
to
improve
fuel
standards
ban
old
cars
and
stop
diesel
trucks
from
entering
certain
areas
as
car
ownership
surges
by
about
million
vehicles
per
year
california
officials
eager
to
maintain
the
state
s
leadership
role
on
climate
action
hope
to
pave
the
way
for
a
fix
to
entrenched
urban
sprawl
los
angeles
is
mulling
a
proposal
to
charge
drivers
during
rush
hour
and
use
that
money
to
make
public
transit
free
by
according
to
metro
chief
executive
phillip
washington
other
options
include
waiving
fees
for
pooled
rides
to
and
from
airports
and
adding
safety
lanes
for
scooters
and
bikes
said
dan
sperling
director
of
the
institute
of
transportation
studies
at
the
university
of
california
davis
carb
deputy
executive
officer
kurt
karperos
said
the
state
is
planning
talks
with
municipal
governments
to
discuss
controlling
emissions
through
city
planning
such
efforts
could
include
housing
in
urban
centers
to
bring
people
closer
to
work
and
the
elimination
of
building
codes
requiring
parking
spots
to
encourage
more
carpooling
according
to
experts
it
is
a
tough
problem
