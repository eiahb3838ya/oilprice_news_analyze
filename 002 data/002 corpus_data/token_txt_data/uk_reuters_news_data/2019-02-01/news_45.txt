align
with
climate
goals
it
said

a
large
group
of

further
evidence
of
the
way
the
energy

and
investors
are
engaging
on
climate
issues

agreement
with
a
group
of
investors
with
trillion
under
management
known
as
climate
action
comes
weeks
after
rival
royal
dutch
shell
agreed
to
introduce
broad
carbon
emissions
targets
linked
to
executive
pay
unlike
other
companies
bp
has
agreed
to
detail
how
major
future
investments
in
fossil
fuels
will
be
consistent
with
the
paris
agreement
to
reduce
carbon
emissions
to
net
zero
by
the
end
of
the
century
by
phasing
out
fossil

set
out
new
metrics
to
measure
greenhouse
gas
emissions
from
its

would
link
carbon
targets
to
the
remuneration
of
of
its

revealed
a
fundamental
rift
with
investors
over
bp
s
statement
that
its
strategy
today
was
in
line
with
the
paris
agreement
investors
remain
concerned
that
the
company
has
not
yet
demonstrated
that
its
strategy
which
includes
growth
in
oil
and
gas
as
well
as
pursuing
low
carbon
businesses
is
consistent
with
the
paris
goals
climate
action
said
in
statement
bp
plans
to
rapidly
grow
oil
and
gas
production
over
the
next
five
years
thanks
to
more
than
a
dozen
new
projects
launched
in
recent
years
as
well
as
the
billion
acquisition
of
bhp
s
shale
portfolio
last
year
we
will
be
open
and
transparent
about
our
ambitions
and
targets
as
well
as
our
progress
against
them
bp

helge
lund
said
in
a
statement
bp
chief
executive
officer
bob
dudley
has
repeatedly
said
that
while
the
oil
and
gas
sector
needs
to
play
a
role
in
the
transition
to
low
carbon
energy
it
still
needs
to
meet
growing
demand
for
fossil
fuels
particularly
in
emerging
economies
bp
is
committed
to
helping
solve
the
dual
challenge
of
providing
more
energy
with
fewer
emissions
we
are
determined
to
advance
the
energy
transition
while
also
growing
shareholder
value
lund
said
investors
and
analysts
have
said
many
oil
and
gas
projects
such
as
complex
and
expensive
investments
in
canada
or
some
deepwater
basins
will
not
be
needed
in
the
transition
to
a
low
carbon
energy
while
bp
agreed
to
increase
its
disclosure
around
climate
it
also
rejected
another
resolution
tabled
by

this
calling
for
emission
reduction
targets
for
all
its
operations
including
emissions
from
products

sells

customers

over
the
decade

to
grow
