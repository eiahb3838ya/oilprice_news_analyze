includes
several

christy
has
downplayed
the
threat
of
climate
change
in
congressional
hearings
and
media
appearances
arguing
that
scientific
models
overestimate
warming
and
that
major
steps
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
are
not
warranted
those
views
place
him
outside
the
mainstream
scientific
consensus
including
from
federal
agencies
that
global
warming
will
have
devastating
consequences
if
not
urgently
addressed
but
they
dovetail
with
president
donald
trump
s
policy
of
rolling
back
regulations
to
free
up
more
drilling
and
mining
christy
did
not
immediately

diversity
needed
to

all
epa
wheeler
a
former
coal

lobbyist
has
said
he
believes
climate
change
is
occurring
but
told
senators
at
his
confirmation
hearing
earlier
this
month
that
he
did
not
see
it
as
an
urgent
problem
trump
has
also
repeatedly
downplayed
the
threat
of
climate
change
and
announced
his
intention
shortly
after

office
in
january
to
pull
the
united
states
from
a
global
accord
to

it
the
science
advisory

the
epa
in
barred
scientists
who
have
won

a
move
the

aimed
at
reducing
conflicts
of
interest
but
which
environmental
groups
said
would
keep
qualified
scientists
out
of
contention
