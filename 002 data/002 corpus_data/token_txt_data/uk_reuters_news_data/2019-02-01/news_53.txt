china

reported
on

the
previously
upbeat
mood
was
also
chilled
somewhat
by
white
house
insistence
that
march
was
a
hard
deadline
for
a
deal
a
failure
of
which
would
lead
to
an
increase
in
tariffs
on

analysts
mostly
remain
deeply
sceptical
that
a
genuine
trade
deal
can
be
done
on

frame
noted
economists
from

we
are
less
pessimistic
since
these
negotiations
are
being
conducted
by
senior

by
trade
bureaucrats

added
both
sides
also

at

this

surprised
