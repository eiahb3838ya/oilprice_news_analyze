super
bowl
will
score
on
the
clean
energy
front
with
an
environmental
group
and
a
beer
maker
for
the
first
time
offering
to
offset
greenhouse
gas
emissions
linked
to
fans
travel
and
the
host
city
of

organizers
said
more
than
a
million
people
were
expected
to
visit
the
southern
city
and
surrounding
area
for
championship
game
pitting
the
los

against
the
new

patriots
the
environmental
rocky

institute
rmi
and
giant
beer
maker
budweiser
said
they
would
purchase
clean
energy
certificates
to
fuel
the
party
clean
energy
certificates
are
a
way
for
one
company
to
offset
the
amount
of
carbon
dioxide
it
is
producing
by
paying
another
company
to
produce
less
rmi
said
it
struck
a
deal
with
atlanta
s
airport
to
offset
metric
tons
of
carbon
emissions
pegged
to
fans
air
travel
to
the
game
generating
equivalent
greenhouse
gases
of
cars
driven
for
a
year
the
clean
energy
will
come
from
capturing
gas
produced
at
two
landfills
rmi
said
the
deal
also
involved
offset
energy
provider
the
good
traveler
meanwhile
the
brewer
of
budweiser
said
it
will
donate
clean
electricity
certificates
to
atlanta
the
amount
of
which
will
be
calculated
following
the
game
the
contributions
mark
an
expansion
of
an
effort
already
more
than
a
decade
old
to
offset
electricity
associated
with
the
annual
game
said
jack
groh
director
of
the
national
football
league
s
environmental
program
the
league
previously
purchased
renewable
energy
certificates
to
cover
the
energy
footprint
associated
with
the
host
stadium
convention
center
teams
hotels
and
other
items
he
said
typically
energy
use
tied
to
the
super
bowl
averages
megawatts
of
energy
per
hour
said
groh
generating
greenhouse
gasses
equivalent
to
cars
driven
for
a
year
offset
certificates
have
recently
cost
between
and
per
he
said
at
pennsylvania
state
university
judd
michael
a
professor
specializing
in
sports
sustainability
said
that
given
the
challenges
of
developing
clean
energy
infrastructure
for
the
sports
event
offsets
may
be
the
best
option
there
if
we
can
use
the
super
bowl
to
encourage
green
energy
such
as
solar
wind
and
help
to
pay
for
the
solar
or
wind
power
either
way
that
s
a
positive
for
the
development
of
those
markets
he
added
natural
gas
accounts
for
just
over
percent
of
georgia
s
net
electricity
generation
according
to
the
state
s
government
followed
by
nuclear
energy
and
coal
cleaner
sources
such
as
hydroelectricity
contributed
just
percent
burning
fossil
fuels
such
as
natural
gas
and
coal
for
energy
emits
greenhouse
gases
which
cause
global
warming
the
united
states
the
world
second
largest
emitter
of
greenhouse
gases
saw
its
carbon
dioxide
emissions
rise
by
percent
last
year
