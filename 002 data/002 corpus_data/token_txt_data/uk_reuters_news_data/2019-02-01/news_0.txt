results
for

were
especially
strong
said
brian
youngberg
an
analyst
with
edward
jones
it
was
a
good
quarter
to
end
the
year
i
think
the
focus
now
will
be
on
improving
the
cash
flow
he
said
exxon
is
not
planning
share
buybacks
this
quarter
though
which
makes
it
the
only
international
oil
company
not
currently
repurchasing
shares
analysts
with
simmons
energy
said
in
a
client
note
the
company
now
expects
to
spend
billion
this
year
up
from
about
billion
it
had
forecast
previously
and
analysts
at
morgan
said
in
a
client
note
that
the
higher
spending
takes
away
from
the
sizzle
of
the
ceo
darren
woods
said
exxon
would
sanction
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
projects
on
the
gulf
coast
and
in
mozambique
this
year
qatar
petroleum
and
exxon
are
expected
to
announce
plans
next
week
to
proceed
with
the
billion
golden
pass
lng
terminal
export
project
in
texas
pretax
earnings
in
its
refining
business
were
billion
up
billion
over
the
same
period
the
year
prior
exxon
earned
billion
more
pretax
in
its
upstream
business
than
it
did
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
and
said
higher
natural
gas
prices
were
partially
offset
by
lower
liquids
pricing
pretax
profits
in
exxon
s
chemicals
business
were
down
million
on
weaker
margins
expenses
and
higher
downtime
and
maintenance
woods
credited
results
to
the
company
optimizing
its
operations
across
the
board
and
said
it
has
an
advantage
because
of
its
ability
to
tie
decisions
in
the
oil
field
to
logistics
and
refining
irrespective
of
where
we
are
in
the
cycle
we
re
going
to
be
advantaged
versus
the
rest
of
industry
he
said
woods
joined
a
conference
call
with
analysts
this
morning
for
the
first
time
since
becoming
ceo
two
years
ago
production
declines
have
been
a
significant
issue
in
previous
quarters
for
exxon
and
it
is
a
positive
sign
that
production
improved
in
the
fourth
quarter
said
muhammed
ghulam
analyst
with
raymond
james
but
he
noted
the
earnings
beat
was
partially
driven
by
asset
sale
gains
of
more
than
million
from
a
refinery
sale
exxon
shares
closed
up
percent
at
they
are
down
about
percent
in
the
last
year
exxon
is
a
component
of
the
