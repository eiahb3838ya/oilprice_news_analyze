first
two
months
on

job
according
to
a
copy
of
his
schedule
the
industry
focus
fits
neatly
with
the
administration
s
efforts
to
reduce
environmental
red
tape
for
companies

could
add
fuel
to
criticism
from
democrats
that
wheeler
who

due
to
be
confirmed
by
the
senate
in
the
coming
days
is
too
cozy
with
the
industries
he
oversees
wheeler
a
longtime
washington

took
the
reins
at
epa
in
july
after

storm
of
controversy
over
his
high
spending
on
travel
security
and
office
equipment

first
several
weeks
on
the

a
comment
pruitt
had
also
held
the
vast
majority
of
his
meetings
with
industry
representatives
according
to
his
public
schedule
but
in
wheeler
trump
has
seen
another
strong
supporter
of
his
deregulatory
agenda
and
advocate
for
the
fossil
fuels
industry
without
the
constant
criticism
over
alleged
ethical
violations
that
plagued
pruitt

had
worked
at
the

later
in
