global
shares
crept
lower
from
their
highest
levels
in
two
months
on
friday
as
data
showing
shrinking
factory
activity
in
china
dampened
a
rally
that
took
them
to
their
best
january
on
record
stocks
have
benefited
this
week
from
the
federal
reserve
which
all
but
abandoned
plans
for
further
rate
hikes
and
on
optimism
that
a
trade
deal
might
be
on
the
cards
but
the
index
of
chinese
manufacturing
fell
to
its
lowest
since
february
adding
to
a
growing
list
of
economic

the

came

expectations
although
those
for

france
and
the

zone
were
in
line
with
forecasts
equity
markets
have
been
relieved
by
a
change
of
heart
at
the
federal
reserve
which
signalled
this
week
that
its
drive
to
tighten
monetary
policy
may
be
at
an
end
amid
a
suddenly
cloudy
outlook
for
the
economy
as
it
held
interest
rates
steady
the
central
bank
also
discarded
its
promises
of
further
gradual
increases
in
interest
rates
and
said
it
would
be
patient
before
making
any
further
moves
the
fed
federal
reserve
decision
should
not
only
be
supportive
of
risk
markets
but
also
the
weaker
dollar
backdrop
could
be
extended
which
should
support
em
assets
especially
at
a
time
when
china
is
attempting
to
stimulate
growth
said
mohammed
kazmi
portfolio
manager
at
ubp
the
market
will
now
turn
its
attention
to
the
outcome
of
trade
talks
as
well
as
the

stocks
had
also

after
president
donald
trump
said
he
would
meet
chinese
president
xi
jinping
soon
to
try
to
seal
a
comprehensive

deal

china
s
official
xinhua
news
agency
reported
the
previously
upbeat
mood
was
also
chilled
somewhat
by
white
house
insistence
that
march
was
a
hard
deadline
for
a
deal
a
failure
of
which
would
lead
to
an
increase
in
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
analysts
mostly
remain
deeply
sceptical
that
a
genuine
trade
deal
can
be
done
on
this
time
frame
economists
from
commonwealth
bank
of
australia
said
in
a
note
we
are
less
pessimistic
since
these
negotiations
are
being
conducted
by
senior
politicians
not
by
trade
bureaucrats
they
added
both
sides
also
have
an
incentive
and
arguably
a
growing
incentive
to
get
a
meaningful
deal
