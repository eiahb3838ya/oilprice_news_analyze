focus-boeing goes bionic to roll out more dreamliners

boeing
co
is
counting
on
a
new
kind
of
worker
to
help
it
reach
a
target
of
rolling
out
dreamliners
from
its
factories
each
month
half
human
half
robot
the
world
s
largest
planemaker
is
equipping
mechanics
with
exoskeletons
similar
to
ones
that
allow
cameramen
to
quickly
navigate
the
sidelines
of
nfl
football
games
to
increase
their
strength
and
speed
the
suits
also
help
reduce
fatigue
on
repetitive
tasks
such
as
overhead
drilling
you
have
the
capability
of
a
robot
and
the
capability
of
a
human
being
melded
together
christopher
reid
a
boeing
associate
technical
fellow
who
previously
designed
nasa
spacesuits
told
reuters
during
a
factory
tour
the
new
technology
is
an
example
a
broader
shift
in
the
industry
s
focus
towards
production
as
planemakers
face
the
task
of
making
good
on
a
record
order
boom
after
a
decade
in
which
boeing
and
airbus
generated
massive
orders
fuelled
by
the
rise
of
china
and
emerging
markets
the
main
battleground
is
shifting
towards
production
strategy
rather
than
market
share
at
twin
dreamliner
factories
in
south
carolina
and
washington
state
boeing
also
plans
to
soon
deploy
smart
wrenches
that
signal
if
machinists
apply
the
correct
torque
to
a
nut
and
has
introduced
new
work
platforms
to
shave
time
off
aircraft
assembly
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
technologies
such
technology
investments
will
help
the
manufacturer
accelerate
dreamliner
production
to
a
month
from
chief
executive
officer
dennis
muilenburg
announced
the
preliminary
rate
change
on
wednesday
and
said
he
expects
to
complete
the
production
increase
in
the
second
quarter
building
the
carbon
composite
dreamliner
at
the
new
rate
first
reported
by
reuters
is
central
to
boeing
s
efforts
to
raise
profit
margins
and
claw
back
deferred
production
costs
as
it
competes
with
airbus
se
in
a
crowded
but
lucrative
widebody
market
boeing
rolls
out
a
new
with
a
minimum
list
price
of
million
every
days
at
rate
that
new
pace
drops
to
days
to
make
a
new
dreamliner
at
today
s
rate
boeing
is
reducing
the
billion
billion
pounds
in
deferred
production
costs
by
million
per
aircraft
canaccord
genuity
analyst
ken
herbert
said
that
number
will
clearly
improve
at
the
new
boeing
estimates
the
exoskeletons
which
cost
about
apiece
have
sped
up
work
tasks
in
test
groups
of
mechanics
in
south
carolina
though
boeing
declined
to
share
data
if
trials
continue
to
show
improved
safety
and
productivity
boeing
says
it
wants
to
deploy
them
to
thousands
of
workers
across
the
company
over
the
next
two
years
in
recent
weeks
boeing
has
also
introduced
work
platforms
similar
to
scaffolds
that
hug
an
airframe
so
mechanics
can
work
as
a
jetliner
pulses
along
the
assembly
line
before
work
stations
had
to
be
moved
with
fork
lifts
boeing
s
mostly
competes
against
the
of
which
airbus
builds
a
month
these
widebody
planes
represent
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
in
sales
over
years
both
are
modernizing
their
factories
but
on
widebody
jets
boeing
s
higher
production
rate
gives
it
the
advantage
to
drive
down
costs
across
its
supply
chain
and
sell
more
of
its
pricier
dreamliner
variants
like
the
newest
in
the
fourth
quarter
boeing
said
its
operating
margin
on
commercial
aircraft
increased
to
percent
from
percent
from
a
year
ago
partially
driven
by
higher
margins
on
the
dreamliner
widebody
in
south
carolina
engineers
in
a
tiny
workstation
known
as
an
innovation
cell
huddle
around
computers
printers
and
a
virtual
reality
system
to
help
mechanics
test
out
new
tools
without
snarling
the
factory
flow
before
the
cells
boeing
said
workers
had
no
formal
place
to
test
out
new
ideas
or
complain
about
niggling
problems
leaving
them
to
fester
for
years
in
some
cases
boeing
said
three
innovation
cells
in
south
carolina
have
saved
millions
of
dollars
in
costs
since
with
a
raft
of
tools
such
as
a
curved
ruler
the
ruler
alone
cut
six
hours
off
the
time
it
took
a
mechanic
to
all
the
placards
mounted
above
the
seats
inside
on
section
of
a
in
washington
state
it
has
opened
innovation
cells
at
its
widebody
plant
in
everett
and
its
plant
in
renton
also
set
for
rate
increase
the
new
technology
is
aimed
to
help
cut
back
on
the
cost
of
inspections
that
boeing
says
have
been
made
obsolete
due
to
the
new
digital
technology
don
t
inspect
things
twice
mark
stockton
engineering
director
for
boeing
south
carolina
told
reuters
during
the
factory
tour
inspect
things
once
and
validate
things
boeing
said
it
did
not
expect
that
these
changes
in
inspections
will
result
in
the
loss
of
jobs
but
a
union
official
asked
about
the
strategy
warned
it
carries
risks
such
as
higher
injury
rates
or
potentially
delayed
aircraft
deliveries
if
problems
are
discovered
removing
thousands
of
inspections
per
airplane
will
negatively
impact
the
manufacturing
process
and
push
defects
down
line
