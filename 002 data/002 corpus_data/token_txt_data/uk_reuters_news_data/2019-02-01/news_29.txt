column-u.s. gas and electric systems prove resilient in face of polar vortex: kemp

freezing
temperatures
across
much
of
the
northern
united
states
have
caused
barely
a
ripple
in
natural

markets
showing
how
plentiful
supplies
have
become
thanks
to
the
shale
revolution
in
a
sign
of
improving
resilience
the
gas
and
electricity
networks
have
come
through
the
most
recent
polar
vortex
with
far
less
stress
on
gas
supplies
and
electric
generators
than
during
the
last
major
vortex
in
january
while
policymakers
in
washington
debate
whether
the
increasing
interconnectedness
of
gas
and
electricity
systems
poses
a
risk
to
reliability
both
industries
are
improving

gas

still
warmer

far
the

expected
to

temperatures
forecast
to

significantly
in

expected
to

below
the

the
impact
on

stocks
and
prices
of
generally
mild

has
been
compounded
by
much
smaller
draws
on
stockpiles
for
any

this

the

according

rates

the

rate
for
at

two

production
is
growing
so
fast
that
even
with
some
of
the
coldest
weather
in

supplies
have
remained
adequate
with
no

in

and
no
