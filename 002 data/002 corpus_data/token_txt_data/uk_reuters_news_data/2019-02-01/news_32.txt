lebanon
s
new
government
should
prioritise
electricity
reform
after
having
spent
months
wrangling
over
the
cabinet
world
bank
and
officials
said
on
friday
seeking
to
address
daily
blackouts
and
massive
costs
to
the
state
the
government
was
finally
formed
late
on
thursday
and
prime
minister
saad
said
lebanon
needed
bold
reforms
it
has
suffered
years
of
low
growth
and
has
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
public
debts
compared
to
the
size
of
its
economy
foreign
donors
have
promised
to
invest
billions
of
dollars
in
lebanon
s
weak
infrastructure
to
help
get
its
economy
moving
but
will
not
release
most
of
the
money
without
steps
to
curb
the
deficit
hariri
s
government
should
prioritise
reforms
that
lebanon
committed
to
at
a
paris
conference
last
year
where
donors
pledged
support
said
philippe
lazzarini
the
resident
coordinator
in
lebanon
making
progress
on
the
fight
against
corruption
and
reforming
the
electricity
sector
will
be
essential
to
restore
confidence
revitalise
the
economy
and
promote
growth
stability
and
employment
in
the
long
term
he
added
french
president
emmanuel
macron
said
on
thursday
france
would
accompany
lebanon
on
a
path
of
economic
and
social
reforms
especially
through
implementing
the
investment
programme
agreed
at
the
paris
conference
saroj
kumar
jha
the
world
bank
regional
director
for
lebanon
iraq
syria
jordan
and
iran
said
electricity
was
the
area
where
we
want
to
move
in
very
quickly
with
the
bank
bringing
concessional
funding
to
help
reforms
lebanon
s
power
stations
use
expensive
heavy
fuel
and
state
utility
electricite
du
liban
edl
can
not
afford
to
provide
power
leaving
consumers
to
rely
on
costly
private
generators
in
november
parliament
had
to
approve
over
million
in
spending
on
fuel
to
avoid
blackouts
adding
to
lebanon
s
spiralling
debt
the
sector
s
problems
put
off
investors
and
create
tremendous
fiscal
pressure
on
the
government
which
sinks
large
sums
in
subsidising
power
jha
said
i
would
strongly
recommend
they
prioritise
the
energy
sector
engagement
he
added
saying
he
believed
there
was
consensus
on
this
within
the
new
coalition
government
however
capital
markets
senior
emerging
markets
analyst
jason
tuvey
said
he
was
sceptical
the
new
government
could
enact
major
reforms
to
free
the
pledged
aid
its
not
clear
whether
they
can
actually
agree
on
these
measures
so
there
will
be
some
aid
that
will
continue
to
be
locked
up
he
said
jha
wants
lebanon
to
move
ahead
with
a
plan
to
corporatise
state
power
utility
edl
and
to
cut
state
subsidies
of
power
while
providing
a
safety
net
to
poorer
consumers
the
government
also
needs
to
ensure
it
can
attract
investors
for
the
process
of
switching
from
heavy
fuel
to
cheaper
gas
and
work
on
its
creaking
transmission
and
distribution
jha
said
lebanon
hopes
to
develop
its
own
gas
reserves
and
is
exploring
offshore
but
in
the
meantime
it
wants
to
use
imported
liquefied
natural
gas
to
fuel
new
power
plants
and
has
issued
a
tender
for
temporary
import
facilities
at
the
paris
investment
conference
hariri
s
last
government
proposed
two
independent
power
projects
each
with
capacity
of
megawatts
and
needing
investment
of
about
million
