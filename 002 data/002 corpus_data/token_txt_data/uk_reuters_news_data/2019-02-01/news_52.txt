focus-eni keeps foot on the gas in high-speed gulf drive
milan
reuters
in
less
than
months
eni
ceo
claudio
descalzi
has
turned
the
middle
east
from
a
sideshow
to
a
strategic
hub
for
the
italian
energy
major
and
the
shift
is
not
over
since
last
march
the
has
clinched
nine
deals
in
the
united
arab
emirates
gained
a
toehold
in
bahrain
and
expanded
in
oman
to
reshape
the
group
s
future
in
the
latest
deal
on
sunday
eni
pledged
billion
to
buy
part
of
the
world
s
refinery
in
the
uae
increasing
its
own
refining
capacity
overnight
by
more
than
a
third
but
the
buying
spree
is
not
over
and
the
company
is
looking
to
further
bolster
its
presence
in
the
gulf
region
according
to
three
banking
and
industry
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
they
said
eni
was
now
primarily
targeting
upstream
exploration
assets
oil
and
gas
fields
rather
than
downstream
operations
the
company
is
looking
to
buy
more
assets
in
the
uae
as
well
as
entering
qatar
the
sources
said
without
giving
further
details
descalzi
was
in
the
uae
times
last
year
to
personally
build
relationships
to
secure
the
deals
said
a
separate
industry
source
and
there
s
more
on
the
eni
declined
to
comment
the
gulf
drive
is
part
of
descalzi
s
plans
to
cut
eni
s
traditional
reliance
on
africa
which
accounts
for
more
than
half
its
production
while
gaining
more
exposure
to
refining
assets
in
an
region
closer
to
asian
markets
in
recent
years
weakness
in
the
company
s
downstream
businesses
like
refining
and
chemicals
have
dragged
on
profits
and
placed
more
of
a
premium
on
securing
success
in
exploration
its
heavy
presence
in
africa
with
the
risk
associated
with
working
in
places
like
libya
and
nigeria
has
also
weighed
on
share
price
performance
a
banking
source
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
eni
was
targeting
the
gulf
area
of
the
middle
east
because
it
did
not
have
the
political
and
security
risks
of
countries
like
iraq
the
gulf
region
has
in
recent
years
attracted
the
world
s
top
oil
companies
seeking
stakes
in
big
and
oil
and
gas
fields
at
a
time
of
uncertainty
over
oil
prices
contracts
in
the
region
also
guarantee
stable
revenues
even
if
the
returns
are
lower
than
other
riskier
fields
but
while
majors
like
bp
total
shell
and
exxon
have
had
a
strong
presence
in
the
gulf
for
decades
eni
has
not
the
italian
firm
s
strategy
of
selling
down
assets
like
its
prize
zohr
gas
field
in
egypt
has
been
key
to
its
recent
expansion
in
the
region
last
march
eni
traded
a
stake
in
zohr
with
emirates
fund
mubadala
to
get
its
first
foothold
in
the
country
since
when
it
has
clinched
a
flurry
of
more
deals
with
uae
oil
giant
adnoc
zohr
was
used
as
a
way
in
since
then
the
group
has
ramped
up
operations
lightning
fast
in
an
area
that
has
some
of
the
world
s
biggest
resources
and
that
s
on
the
doorstep
of
asia
said
mediobanca
oil
analyst
alessandro
pozzi
in
qatar
eni
can
count
on
good
relations
with
the
state
petroleum
firm
which
recently
bought
mexican
oil
blocks
from
the
italian
company
a
decade
ago
eni
was
struggling
to
replace
reserves
and
lost
credibility
over
its
management
of
the
huge
kashagan
oilfield
in
kazakhstan
but
giant
gas
discoveries
in
mozambique
and
egypt
have
since
given
it
the
strongest
discovery
record
in
the
industry
boosting
its
credentials
with
nations
in
adnoc
presented
its
strategy
plan
to
open
up
its
energy
markets
to
foreign
operators
and
attract
the
skills
needed
to
develop
the
exploration
and
production
refining
and
petrochemical
industries
when
you
are
a
country
thinking
who
can
find
the
stuff
you
look
to

its
