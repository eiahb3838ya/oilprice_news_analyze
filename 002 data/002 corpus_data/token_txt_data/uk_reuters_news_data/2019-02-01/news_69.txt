president
donald
trump
said
on
thursday
he
will
meet
with
chinese
president
xi
jinping
soon
to
try
to
seal
a
comprehensive
trade
deal
as
the
top
negotiator
reported
substantial
progress
in
two
days
of
talks
trump
said
he
was
optimistic
that
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
could
reach
the
biggest
deal
ever
the
upbeat
mood
was
chilled
somewhat
by
the
white
house
insistence
that
march
was
a
hard
deadline
for
a
deal
a
failure
of
which
would
lead
to
an
increase
in
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
analysts
mostly
remain
deeply
sceptical
that
a
genuine
trade
deal
can
be
done
on
this
time
frame
noted
economists
from
commonwealth
bank
of
australia
in
a
note
we
are
less
pessimistic
since
these
negotiations
are
being
conducted
by
senior
politicians
not
by
trade
bureaucrats
they
added
both
sides
also
have
an
incentive
and
arguably
a
growing
incentive
to
get
a
meaningful
deal
the
optimism
supported

ending
thursday
with
a

the
nasdaq
jumped
percent
on
the
back
of
a
near
percent
rise
in
facebook
inc
the

slipped

over

the

p
rose
percent
its
best
monthly
performance
since
late
and
its
strongest
start
to
a
year
since
the
nasdaq
gained
percent
in

of

topped
profit
estimates
according
to
refinitiv
data
equity
markets
have
also
been
relieved
by
a
change
of
heart
at
the
federal
reserve
which
this
week
surprised
many
by
abandoning
plans
for
further
rate
hikes
investors
responded
by
pricing
in
a
chance
that
interest
rates
could
actually
be
cut
this
year
yields
on
treasuries
were
down
basis
points
on
the
week
so
far
which
if
sustained
would
be
the
largest
weekly
decline
since
january
that
in
turn
has
been
a
drag
on
the
dollar
though
it
was
off
its
lows
on
friday
it
was
down
percent
so
far
this
week
against
the
yen
at
but
found
some
support
around
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
was
a
shade
firmer
on
friday
at
thanks
in
part
to
a
pullback
in
the
euro
to
the
single
currency
took
a
knock
when
bundesbank
president
jens
weidmann
painted
an
unusually
bleak
picture
of
the
german
economy
saying
the
country
s
slump
will
last
longer
than
initially
thought
