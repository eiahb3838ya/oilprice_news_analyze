the

weather
bureau
said
on
friday
the
heatwave
which
saw
temperatures
above
celsius
fahrenheit
for
several
days
straight
in
some
areas
was
mainly
due
to
a
high
pressure
system
off
the
southeast
coast
that
blocked
cooler
air
from
coming
in
the
bureau
of
meteorology
said
a
delayed
monsoon
also
kept
cooler
moist
air
coming
in
from
the
north
and
a
warming
trend
that
has
pushed
australian
temperatures
up
by
more
than
in
the
last
years
also
contributed
to
the
heat
said
andrew
watkins
a
senior
climatologist

last

triggered
power
outages
in
some
