focus-some us metals importers resigned to higher prices as trump's tariffs bite
houston

metals
importers
that
applied
last
year
for
exemptions
from
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminum
are
losing
hope
the
commerce
department
will
approve
their
petitions
as
the
recent
government
shutdown
added
to
a
wait
that
for
some
has
stretched
to
eight
months
without
a
ruling
importers
ranging
from
pipeline
giant
kinder
morgan
inc
to
a
steel
tube
manufacturer
sanitube
have
submitted
some
requests
to
avoid
tariffs
of
percent
on
steel
and
percent
on
aluminum
that
president
trump
ordered
last
march
according
to
the
latest
commerce
department
data
obtained
by
reuters
the
sheer
number
of
requests
a
late
decision
to
allow
appeals
and
the
government
shutdown
that
ended
last
week
have
left
more
than
half
the
petitions
without
a
decision
when
the
trump
administration
evoked
a
national
security
clause
to
impose
the
tariffs
it
offered
relief
to
companies
that
struggled
to
find
substitutes
and
many
importers
were
optimistic
they
could
secure
exemptions
yet
out
of
the
requests
submitted
by
hundreds
of
companies
the
administration
has
so
far
approved
around
and
rejected
according
to
commerce
around
have
been
returned
without
action
due
to
filing
errors
commerce
said
now
some
importers
say
they
have
all
but
given
up
on
relief
assuming
higher
prices
are
there
to
stay
acting
as
a
lasting
drag
on
their
business
and
more
broadly
on
the
whole
economy
sanitube
llc
a
supplier
of
stainless
steel
tubes
for
the
food
and
other
industries
filed
two
exclusion
requests
for
different
sized
products
last
year
one
application
for
a
much
larger
volume
was
denied
as
incomplete
and
the
other
was
granted
sanitube
president
todd
adams
estimates
that
denial
had
cost
it
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
i
ve
basically
written
it
off
adams
told
reuters
he
said
he
still
planned
to
a
request
for
relief
but
called
the
quest
to
overturn
the
initial
rejection
a
pet
i
ve
moved
on
adams
said
heat
transfer
tubular
products
which
makes
parts
for
the
oil
and
gas
industry
lost
a
ruling
last
year
and
has
not
even
sought
a
reconsideration
said
janese
sokulski
vice
president
of
sales
as
decisions
on
requests
for
relief
drag
on
companies
are
passing
on
as
much
of
the
extra
cost
as
they
can
to
consumers
while
absorbing
the
rest
some
foreign
suppliers
are
also
covering
some
of
the
costs
to
stay
competitive
in
the
market
while
the
tariffs
helped
curb
imports
and
bolster
domestic
steel
industry
they
have
increased
costs
for
auto
construction
food
service
and
energy
companies
the
federal

s
beige
book
snapshot
of
economic
conditions
pointed
to
tariffs
as
contributing
to
rising
costs
in
several
regions
of
the
united
states
originally
the
government
said
most
exemption
applications
could
be
processed
in
about
days
but
an
uproar
over
the
number
denied
led
to
an
extended
review
process
for
contested
applications
and
significantly
longer
wait
times
i
think
the
trump
administration
s
method
is
burnout
there
is
a
path
towards
exemption
but
it
s
very
difficult
said
lisa
goldenberg
president
of
wholesale
steel
distribution
firm
delaware
steel
company
which
works
closely
with
steel
market
participants
they
started
off
saying
i
m
really
important
i
m
a
critical
need
there
s
no
way
this
administration
who
loves
me
is
going
to
hurt
me
goldenberg
said
about
the
petitioners
they
have
totally
different
language
a
commerce
spokesman
said
the
expanded
review
was
a
worthwhile
addition
to
the
exclusion
process
and
that
it
welcomed
all
valid
exclusion
requests
and
has
dedicated
resources
to
render
determinations
as
expeditiously
as
the
spokesman
added
that
requests
could
be
processed
faster
if
it
had
obtained
authorization
from
congress
to
allocate
more
funds
to
the
process
it
requested
to
reallocate
million
from
other
parts
of
commerce
s
budget
but
so
far
has
only
been
allowed
to
reallocate
million
for
the
review
for
the
steel
industry
was
a
good
year
it
saw
a
percent
increase
in
employment
above
the
percent
gain
for
all
jobs
according
to
labor
department
data
the
latest
figures
from
the
american
institute
of
steel
and
iron
also
showed
steel
shipments
up
percent
in
the
first
months
of
while
imports
were
down
percent
in
the
overall
condition
of
the
industry
has
improved
said
tom
gibson
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
aisi
however
the
tariffs
have
hurt
other
industries
a
lot
of
expansions
and
contracts
are
on
hold
the
impacts
of
pricing
have
been
significant
said
representative
jackie
walorski
an
indiana
republican
some
businesses
in
her
district
have
furloughed
workers
or
canceled
expansions
due
to
tariffs
kinder
morgan
which
bought
turkish
steel
pipe
subject
to
a
percent
tariff
for
about
half
of
a
billion
pipeline
still
has
not
received
a
ruling
on
its
may
exemption
filing
an
exclusion
for
another
energy
project
proposed
by
plains
all
american
pipeline
also
remains
under
review
after
an
initial
denial
last
july
the
tariffs
are
projected
to
add
million
to
plains
pipeline
cost
and
as
much
as
million
to
kinder
morgan
s
we
made
a
strong
case
to
the
department
and
hope
they
resolve
the
issue
quickly
kinder
morgan
said
in
an
emailed
statement
plains
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
in
the
shale
fields
where
oil
production
is
at
record
levels
prices
for
tubular
goods
used
in
drilling
soared
last
year
adding
to
cost
pressures
in
and
finishing
according
to
data
from
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
in
one
west
texas
oilfield
tubular
goods
prices
climbed
percent
it
said
primarily
due
to
tariffs
in
another
shale
field
that
stretches
across
parts
of
texas
and
northern
louisiana
tariffs
bumped
the
cost
of
drilling
a
new
well
by
a
third
to
the
companies
are
still
lobbying
for
some
concessions
but
i
think
they
re
getting
pretty
weary
