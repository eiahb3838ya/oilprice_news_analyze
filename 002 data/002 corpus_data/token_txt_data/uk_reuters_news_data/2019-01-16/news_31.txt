democratic
lawmakers
will
grill
president
donald
trump
s
new
pick
to
run
the
environmental
protection
agency
on
wednesday
over
his
past
coal
lobbying
but
have
little
hope
of
blocking
his
confirmation
in
the
senate
trump
nominated
epa
acting
administrator
andrew
wheeler
to
run
the
agency
permanently
last
week
a
pick
that
could
provide
him
another
avid
supporter
of
his
deregulatory
and
fuels
agenda
without
the
constant
criticism
over
alleged
mismanagement
that
plagued
wheeler
s
predecessor
scott
pruitt
a
washington
insider
with
years
experience
as
a
top
aide
to
republican
senator
and
climate
skeptic
jim
inhofe
wheeler
has
been
running
the
epa
since
july
when
pruitt
resigned
in
a
flurry
of
criticism
over
his
expensive
travel
and
use
of
resources
and
staff
for
personal
matters
democrats
on
the
senate
environment
and
public
works
committee
running
wednesday
s
confirmation
hearing
said
they
would
press
wheeler
on
his
past
lobbying
which
includes
work
for
underground
coal
giant
murray
energy
a
vocal
proponent
for
reduced
environmental
and
safety
regulation
they
are
also
likely
to
needle
wheeler
about
his
record
so
far
at
epa
which
has
largely
been
a
follow
through
on
pruitt
s
moves
to
undo
or
weaken
environmental
regulations
including
on
power
plant
pollutant
emissions
i
urged
him
to
restore
public
trust
in
the
agency
by
heeding
lessons
of
the
past
and
by
remedying
some
of
scott
pruitt
s
most
egregious
actions
and
proposals
he
has
not
done
so
said
senator
tom
carper
the
top
democrat
on
the
committee
industry
representatives
and
republican
lawmakers
however
have
largely
praised
wheeler
for
his
deregulatory
stance
arguing
the
epa
has
for
years
imposed
requirements
on
businesses
that
have
hurt
growth
he
understands
how
the
regulatory
process
works
and
the
type
of
effort
that
is
required
to
develop
effective
and
legally
defensible
regulatory
reforms

jeff
holmstead
a
partner
at
industry
law
firm
bracewell

former

environmental
health
plan
to
attend
wednesday
s
hearing
in
protest
dominique
browning
a
member
of
the
group
wrote
in
a
new
york
times
on
monday
that
wheeler
should
not
be
entrusted
with
protecting
us
from
harm
and
that
his
recent
move
to
weaken
mercury
limits
by
downplaying
their
benefits
was
harmful
