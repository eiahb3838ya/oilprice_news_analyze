petrochina
is
selling
spot
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
cargoes
on
the
european
market
from
russia
s
yamal
plant
adding
to
a
flood
of
volumes
to
the
continent
amid
subdued
asian
demand
trade
sources
said
petrochina
s
increased
presence
in
europe
is
an
example
of
how
asian
energy
companies
are
expanding
their
role
as
lng
traders
engaging
in
lng
transactions
globally
the
early
of
yamal
lng
s
second
and
third
trains
or
production
lines
in
raised
spot
volumes
from
russia
and
helped
petrochina
boost
its
european
market
presence
selling

from
its
percent
share
of
the
project
s
spot
volumes
petrochina
has
offered
cargoes
mainly
to
northwest
europe
this
winter
with
buyers
that
include
trading
houses
vitol
and
trafigura
as
well
as
uk
oil
major
bp
two
sources
said
regular
volumes
from
yamal
ensure
a
more
stable
presence
in
europe
for
petrochina
the
publicly
traded
arm
of
china
national
petroleum
last
winter
petrochina
also
traded
some
spot
volumes
from
yamal
lng
train
however
a
spike
in
yamal
lng
production
at
the
end
of
to
million
tonnes
per
annum
mtpa
has
allowed
petrochina
to
compete
for
buyers
with
another
yamal
lng
shareholder
novatek
and
producers
this
winter
has
seen
europe
become
a
prime
destination
for
spot
lng
cargoes
amid
weak
asian
demand
and
increased
shipping
costs
to
transport
lng
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
basins
russia
s
novatek
has
a
percent
share
of
yamal
lng
spot
cargoes
and
has
been
offering
up
to
two
cargoes
a
week
to
european
buyers
a
source
close
to
the
matter
said
petrochina
s
sales
are
organised
via
tenders
open
to
a
limited
number
of
participants
an
lng
trader
said
adding
that
the
tenders
are
being
held
almost
every
week
this
winter
france
s
total
which
also
has
a
percent
share
of
yamal
spot
lng
has
not
been
marketing
the
volumes
sources
said
with
a
low
spread
between
european
gas
and
asian
lng
prices
some
traders
and
brokers
expect
petrochina
s
spot
volumes
to
stay
in
europe
for
most
of
this
year
there
is
still
a
very
high
interest
for
spot
lng
volumes
in
europe
unlike
last
winter
an
lng
buyer
in
europe
said
petrochina
has
a
offtake
deal
from
yamal
for
mpta
aimed
at
delivery
in
china
only
and
expected
to
start
this
year
that
deal
is
part
of
a
