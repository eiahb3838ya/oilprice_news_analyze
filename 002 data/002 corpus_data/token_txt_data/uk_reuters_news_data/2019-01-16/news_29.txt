world
equity
markets
on
wednesday
held
their
nerve
after
the
heavy
parliamentary
defeat
of
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
brexit
deal
as
investors
saw
potential
for
legislative
deadlock
forcing
london
to
delay
its
departure
from
the
eu
may
s
government
faces
a
no
confidence
vote
at
gmt
after
the
shattering
rejection
of
her
brexit
blueprint
on
tuesday
evening
left
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
in
disarray
may
is
expected
to
survive
the
vote
sponsored
by
the
main
opposition
labour
party
but
investors
could
see
scant
sign
of
a
breakthrough
in
the
brexit
impasse
as
a
result
they
are
increasingly
betting
on
britain
being
forced
to
postpone
its
planned
march
exit
though
few
have
any
clarity
on
what
that
would
mean
for
the
country
in
the
longer
run
stock
markets
had
largely
priced
in
the
overnight
defeat
and
for
the
most
part
held
on
to
early
gains
that
mirrored
earlier
resilience
in
asian
markets
there
stocks
had
shrugged
off
may
s
defeat
and
were
lifted
by
signs
that
china
will
take
more
steps
to
bolster
its
slowing
economy
and
the
federal
reserve
might
pause
its
run
of
interest
rate
rises
markets
seem
to
be
pricing
in
a
greater
probability
of
a
soft
brexit
said
azad
zangana
a
european
economist
and
strategist
at
schroders
however
we
believe
that
investors
are
getting
ahead
of
the

to

percent

french
and
spanish
bourses
edged
up
while
germany
s
main
index
lost
percent
britain
s
main
equity
index
dropped
as
much
as
percent
with
investors
shifting
focus
from
brexit
to
results
and
news
of
mergers
and
acquisitions
expectations
of
a
softer
brexit
perhaps
incorporating
the
labour
party
s
idea
of
membership
of
a
permanent
customs
union
gave
support
to
the
pound
sterling
held
at
a
high
against
the
euro
and
was
largely
flat
against
the
dollar
after
seesawing
in
a
broad
percent
trading
range
overnight
by
shortly
after
midday
the
pound
was
trading
at
pence
per
euro
its
strongest
level
since
late
november
and
was
down
percent
at
we
do
think
it
is
unlikely
that
sterling
will
fall
to
fresh
lows
unless
the
current
government
falls
and
that
is
unlikely
although
the
risk
is
not
zero
said
alvin
tan
an
fx
strategist
at
societe
generale
in
london
tan
said
sterling
is
valued
relatively
cheaply
in
part
because
of
the
lingering
possibility
that
britain
could
crash
disruptively
out
of
the
eu
without
a
deal
asian
shares
had
responded
well
to
china
s
central
bank
injecting
a
record
amount
of
money
into
its
financial
system
that
underscored
chinese
officials
commitment
to
signalling
more
measures
to
stabilise
a
slowing
economy

global
markets
have
drawn
succour
from
the
resumption
of
trade
talks
though
scepticism
over
the
absence
of
detailed
progress
was
underlined
overnight
as
the
trade
representative
said
that
he
saw
no
headway
made
on
structural
issues
during
talks
with
china
last
week
investors
are
also
betting
that
the
federal
reserve
will
slow
its
planned
interest
rate
hikes
on
tuesday
policymakers
agreed
the
federal
reserve
should
pause
further
hikes
until
it
is
clear
how
much
the
economy
will
be
held
back
by
larger
risks
such
as
slowing
growth
in
china
investors
are
mainly
focused
on
the
outcome
of
the
trade
negotiations
but
it
may
take
more
than
a
month
before
it
will
become
clear
