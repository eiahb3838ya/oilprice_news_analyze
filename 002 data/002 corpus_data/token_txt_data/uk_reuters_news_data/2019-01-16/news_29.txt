the
value
of
traded
global
markets
for
carbon
dioxide
allowances
soared
percent
last
year
to
a
record
high
of
billion
euros
billion
analysts
at
refinitiv
said
on
wednesday
the
overall
figure
was
pushed
higher
by
the
soaring
cost
of
carbon
permits
in
europe
s
emissions
trading
system
ets
which
more
than
trebled
last
year
from
euros
a
tonne
to
around
euros
in
europe
we
attribute
the
price
rise
mainly
to
anticipation
of
the
market
stability
reserve
that
came
into
effect
in
january
it
will
significantly
tighten
the
supply
the
analysts
said
in
an
annual
global
market
report
the
european
emission
trading
system
ets
charges
power
plants
and
factories
for
every
tonne
of
carbon
dioxide
they
emit
the
ets
has
suffered
from
excess
supply
since
the
financial
crisis
but
this
will
be
addressed
by
new
measures
including
the
market
stability
reserve
which
from
this
year
will
remove
some
surplus
allowances
from
the
market
we
see
as
an
outlier
when
it
comes
to
price
increase
in
one
single
year
and
do
not
expect
a
repetition
of
such
steep
path
in
said
anders

senior
carbon
analyst
at
refinitiv
and
a
contributor
to
the
report
a
total
of
billion
carbon
permits
were
traded
globally
in
up
percent
on
the
previous
year
the
analysts
said
the
european
market
accounted
for
percent
of
the
total
value
of
globally
traded
carbon
permits
with
north
american
trading
schemes
making
up
percent
the
report

volumes
and
traded
value
grew
in
north
america
in
both
the
western
climate
initiative
wci
and
the
regional
greenhouse
gas
initiative
rggi
largely
in
anticipation
of
new
rules
in
both
trading
systems
for
when
they
enter
new
trading
periods
starting
in
the
analysts
said
the
emerging
markets
in
china
and
south
korea
still
see
very
limited
trading
despite
the
fact
that
their
emission
trading
systems
cover
vast
emissions
volumes
