update 4-'not the greatest crisis': trump's epa pick downplays climate threat
washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
s
new
pick
to
run
the
environmental
protection
agency
told
lawmakers
on
wednesday
he
does
not
believe
climate
change
is
a
major
crisis
and
would
continue
to
undo
emission
limits
if
confirmed
trump
nominated
epa
acting
administrator
andrew
wheeler
last
week
to
run
the
agency
permanently
seeking
a
strong
advocate
for
his
fuels
agenda
a
choice
that
cheered
business
interests
and
drawn
scorn
from
environmentalists
i
would
not
call
it
the
greatest
crisis
wheeler
said
at
his
confirmation
hearing
when
asked
if
he
believed
the
increasingly
urgent
warnings
from
scientists
about
the
threats
from
global
warming
wheeler
s
confirmation
is
expected
to
sail
through
the
senate
despite
democratic
opposition
a
washington
insider
with
years
of
experience
he
has
been
running
the
epa
since
july
when
his
predecessor
scott
pruitt
resigned
in
a
flurry
of
criticism
over
his
use
of
resources
and
staff
for
personal
matters
democratic
lawmakers
focused
on
wheeler
s
record
at
epa
his
past
lobbying
work
for
energy
companies
and
his
stance
on
global
warming
casting
him
as
a
extremist
not
fit
to
run
the
nation
s
top
environmental
regulator
democrat
senator
ed
markey
of
massachusetts
and
senator
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
an
independent
who
caucuses
with
democrats
asked
wheeler
his
view
of
global
warming
which
scientists
say
is
driven
by
fossil
fuels
consumption
and
is
leading
to
sea
level
rise
and
more
frequent
flooding
wildfires
and
extreme
weather
wheeler
said
he
believed
global
warming
is
an
important
issue
that
needs
to
be
addressed
but
that
federal
regulation
forcing
deep
emissions
cuts
was
the
wrong
approach
and
more
faith
should
be
put
in
the
hands
of
states
and
private
enterprise
you
are
putting
up
a
smokescreen
to
ensure
there
is
an
advancement
of
donald
trump
s
dirty
policies
markey
said
in
one
of
the
hearing
s
most
heated
exchanges
that
s
why
it
is
relevant
that
you
are
a
former
coal
industry
a
federal
report
written
by
government
agencies
late
last
year
said
climate
change
will
cost
the
economy
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
by
the
end
of
the
century
damaging
everything
from
human
health
to
infrastructure
and
agricultural
production
trump
who
has
repeatedly
cast
doubt
on
climate
change
and
has
indicated
his
intention
to
withdraw
from
a
global
pact
to
fight
it
dismissed
the
report
after
its
release
saying
i
don
t
believe
it
wheeler
said
he
had
been
briefed
on
the
assessment
but
was
waiting
for
further
briefings
from
his
staff
before
taking
a
public
position
on
its
findings
wheeler
defended
his
record
at
epa
which
has
been
largely
defined
by
moves
to
undo
or
weaken
environmental
regulations
he
cast
the
agency
s
rollbacks
as
a
way
to
reduce
the
regulatory
burden
on
business
while
also
protecting
air
and
water
quality
for
americans
among
his
accomplishments
wheeler
last
year
finalized
a
proposal
to
replace
federal
curbs
on
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
power
plants
with
a
new
rule
placing
much
of
that
power
in
the
hands
of
states
he
has
also
overseen
the
epa
s
gutting
of
the
justification
for
mercury
emissions
limits
a
proposal
to
reduce
the
number
of
waterways
under
federal
protection
and
efforts
to
lower
targets
for
vehicle
fuel
efficiency
democrats
pressed
wheeler
on
whether
his
epa
work
was
in
any
way
linked
to
his
previous
lobbying
on
behalf
of
energy
companies
like
underground
coal
giant
murray
energy
a
vocal
proponent
of
reduced
environmental
and
safety
regulation
senator
sheldon
whitehouse
a
rhode
island
democrat
held
up
photos
of
wheeler
attending
meetings
between
murray
s
chief
executive
robert
murray
and
trump
administration
officials
and
asked
wheeler
for
a
full
accounting
of
the
number
of
such
meetings
he
had
arranged
for
the
coal
company
wheeler
said
he
would
provide
a
written
response
industry
representatives
and
republican
lawmakers
have
largely
praised
wheeler
for
his
deregulatory
stance
he
understands
how
the
regulatory
process
works
and
the
type
of
effort
that
is
required
to
develop
effective
and
legally
defensible
regulatory
reforms
said
jeff
holmstead
a
partner
at
law
firm
bracewell
and
a
former
epa
air
administrator
environmental
groups
have
taken
a
different
view
activists
briefly
interrupted
wheeler
s
testimony
on
wednesday
shouting
shut
down
wheeler
not
the
epa
and
several
were
arrested
after
demonstrating
outside
the
hearing
room
