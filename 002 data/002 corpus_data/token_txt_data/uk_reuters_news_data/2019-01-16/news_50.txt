failure to curb climate change a top risk - davos survey
washington
reuters
the
risk
that
global
efforts
to
tackle
climate
change
will
fail
has
risen
despite
concerns
about
powerful
storms
floods
and
droughts
a
survey
released
by
the
world
economic
forum
said
on
wednesday
days
before
its
annual
gathering
in
davos
the
annual
global
risks
report
which
incorporates
the
survey
highlighted
several
top
risks
for
including
massive
incidents
of
data
fraud
and
theft
and
large
scale
cyberattacks
but
the
top
risk
by
likelihood
in
the
survey
was
extreme
weather
in
a
survey
of
experts
from
government
business
academia
and
organizations
and
the
risk
that
failure
by
governments
to
limit
the
magnitude
of
climate
change
and
adapt
to
it
has
risen
to
second
place
in
terms
of
both
likelihood
and
impact
compared
to
only
fifth
place
and
fourth
place
in
those
categories
last
year
in
the
survey
of
all
risks
it
is
in
relation
to
the
environment
that
the
world
is
most
clearly
sleepwalking
into
catastrophe
said
the
report
after
countries
including
the
united
states
agreed
to
tackle
climate
change
in
at
talks
in
paris
worries
in
the
survey
about
governmental
failure
to
tackle
global
warming
fell
but
that
has
changed
after
president
donald
trump
announced
in
his
intention
to
pull
out
of
the
paris
agreement
a
move
he
emphasized
in
in
addition
deadly
wildfires
in
greece
and
california
and
hurricanes
in
florida
and
north
carolina
were
frequently
in
the
news
people
are
beginning
to
understand
increasingly
the
gravity
of
the
situation
and
that
the
paris
agreement
even
if
fully
implemented
can
not
be
seen
as
a
panacea
aengus
collins
the
report
s
author
and
project
leader
told
reuters
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
in
october
said
global
temperatures
are
likely
to
rise
by
degrees
celsius
between
and
if
global
warming
continues
at
its
current
pace
and
if
the
world
fails
to
take
rapid
and
unprecedented
measures
and
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
spiked
percent
last
year
after
falling
for
the
previous
three
the
rhodium
group
an
independent
research
group
said
last
week
trump
who
attended
last
year
s
talks
in
davos
plans
to
send
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
and
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
to
the
talks
that
begin
as
he
grapples
with
democrats
over
a
partial
government
shutdown
the
report
said
rapidly
growing
coastal
cities
particularly
in
asia
are
making
people
more
vulnerable
to
climate
change
a
vicious
circle
of
urbanization
concentrates
people
and
buildings
in
areas
of
potential
damage
while
also
increasing
risks
by
destroying
natural
sources
of
resilience
such
as
mangrove
forests
or
increasing
strain
on
groundwater
reserves
