brazilian
supermodel
gisele
bundchen
on
wednesday
rejected
critiques
by
the
country
s
farm
minister
that
questioned
her
knowledge
about
brazil
s
conservation
efforts
agriculture
minister
tereza
cristina
dias
on
monday
said
that
bundchen
should
not
be
saying
bad
things
about
brazil
for
example
by
calling
the
country
a
deforester
without
knowing
the
facts
bundchen
who
is
married
to
football
star
tom
brady
in
november
blasted
a
proposal
by
president
jair
bolsonaro
to
merge
the
environment
ministry
with
the
agriculture
ministry
that
did
not
happen
but
the
bolsonaro
government
has
stripped
brazil
s
environment
ministry
of
oversight
of
areas
such
as
water
resources
and
eliminated
its
secretariat
on
climate
change
bolsonaro
who
counts
on
powerful
farmers
as
part
of
his
core
supporters
has
said
he
wants
to
end
an
industry
of
environmental
fines
which
activists
say
is
a
major
tool
for
ensuring
rules
are
followed
he
has
also
suggested
brazil
could
exit
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
it
surprised
me
to
see
my
name
mentioned
in
a
negative
way
for
defending
and
speaking
in
favor
of
the
environment
because
i
ve
been
supporting
projects
and
involved
in
causes
since
bundchen
wrote
on
twitter
i
m
always
looking
for
knowledge
through
reading
and
contact
with
scientists
researchers
farmers
cooperative
and
environmental
the
post
did
not
mention
dias
or
the
agriculture
ministry
by
name
dias
responded
by
thanking
bundchen
on
twitter
for
her
message
and
saying
they
should
work
together
to
combat
illegal
deforestation
in
monday
s
radio
broadcast
dias
said
that
bundchen
should
be
promoting
brazil
s
sustainability
efforts
arguing
that
the
country
s
preservation
of
of
its
native
vegetation
is
a
major
environmental
accomplishment
rather
than
criticizing
brazil
the
minister
later
tweeted
that
she
would
soon
invite
bundchen
to
be
an
ambassador
for
brazil
s
efforts
to
feed
the
world
while
preserving
nature
bundchen
did
not
indicate
whether
she
had
received
an
invitation
or
whether
she
would
accept
i
believe
that
agricultural
production
and
environmental
conservation
need
to
go
together
side
by
side
