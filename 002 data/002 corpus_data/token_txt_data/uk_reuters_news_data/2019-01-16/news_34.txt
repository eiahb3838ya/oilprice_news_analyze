in
a
meeting
with

angela
merkel
the
meeting
which
took

said
a
committee
dubbed

is
working
on
a
plan
on
how
to
phase
out
brown

mining
and
power
plants
without
leaving
affected
regions
structurally
weak
and
with
thousands
of
job
losses
operators
of
such
plants
include
rwe
and
uniper
which
have
asked
for
fair
compensation
should
their
plants
be
mothballed
or
closed
ahead
of
time
manufacturers
may
also
ask
for
compensation
should
electricity
prices
rise
as
a
result
of
lower
supply
from
comparably
inexpensive
plants
the

pledged
billion
euros
billion
