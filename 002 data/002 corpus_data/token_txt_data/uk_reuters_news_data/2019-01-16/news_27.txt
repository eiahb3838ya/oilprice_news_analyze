global
growth
is
slowing
and
the
world
economy
is
headed
for
a
recession
in
unless
something
happens
to
give
it
renewed
momentum
the
oecd
s
composite
leading
indicator
fell
to
just
points
in
november
its
lowest
since
october
and
down
from
a
peak
of
at
the
end
of
growth
momentum
has
been
easing
for
some
time
in
britain
canada
france
and
italy
and
there
were
tentative
signs
of
slackening
momentum
in
the
united
states
and
germany
in
november
the
composite
indicator
is
likely
to
fall
even
further
when
data
for
december
are
published
next
month
given
the
weakness
already
revealed
in
equity
markets
and
business
surveys
the
oecd
composite
leading
indicator
has
been
weakening
consistently
for
the
last
year
and
now
points
unambiguously
to
a
contraction
ahead
chartbook
in
the
last
years
whenever
the
index
has
fallen
below
there
has
almost
always
been
a
recession
in
the
united
states
and
the
one
exception
was
the
weakening
of
the
index
in
when
the
united
states
continued
to
grow
despite
the
weakening
global
economy
in
the
aftermath
of
the
asian
financial
crisis
even
in
this
case
however
the
setting
federal
open
market
committee
noted
the
economy
has
been
holding
up
but
is
now
showing
clear
signs
of
when
we
feed
this
information
into
our
various
models
they
inevitably
as
we
might
expect
engender
a
quite
considerable
the
observations
are
contained
in
the
transcript
of
an
unusual
conference
call
held
by
the
federal
open
market
committee
in
september
one
week
later
the
federal
reserve
responded
to
signs
of
a
weakening
economy
by
cutting
interest
rates
most
of
the
world
s
major
economies
outside
the
united
states
showed
clear
signs
of
slackening
growth
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
even
in
the
united
states
the
institute
for
supply
management
s
manufacturing
index
for
december
showed
the
sharpest
deceleration
in
growth
since
the
recessions
of
and
global
trade
volumes
showed
signs
of
slowing
towards
the
end
of
after
strong
growth
in
air
freight
through
hong
kong
international
airport
the
world
s
busiest
air
cargo
hub
and
a
proxy
for
global
trade
was
down
percent
in
the
fourth
quarter
air
freight
volumes
in
hong
kong
were
down
by
a
massive
percent
in
december
compared
with
the
same
month
a
year
earlier
according
to
the
civil
aviation
department
most
economists
now
forecast
a
period
of
slower
growth
in
but
policymakers
have
expressed
hope
for
a
soft
landing
rather
than
an
outright
recession
policymakers
almost
always
aim
for
a
soft
landing
in
an
effort
to
maintain
business
and
consumer
confidence
but
there
are
good
reasons
to
be
sceptical
about
the
scenario
experience
shows
the
economy
is
characterised
by
a
significant
number
of
positive
feedback
mechanisms
which
amplify
booms
and
slumps
expansions
tend
to
accelerate
as
business
investment
employment
incomes
consumer
spending
and
equity
prices
reinforce
each
other
once
the
economy
starts
to
lose
momentum
however
all
these
factors
tend
to
interact
with
each
other
in
the
opposite
direction
to
intensify
the
slowdown
a
soft
landing
is
still
possible
but
a
hard
landing
is
more
likely
unless
something
happens
to
kickstart
global
growth
if
policymakers
want
to
avoid
a
recession
they
have
two
principal
options
a
cut
interest
rates
to
ease
global
financial
conditions
or
b
conclude
a
trade
agreement
between
china
and
the
united
states
to
ease
trade
tensions
and
boost
business
confidence
but
unless
policymakers
intervene
with
one
of
these
alternatives
the
global
economy
s
momentum
will
continue
to
slacken
and
push
it
towards
recession
