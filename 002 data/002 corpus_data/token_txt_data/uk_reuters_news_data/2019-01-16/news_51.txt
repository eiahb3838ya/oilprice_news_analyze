world
equity
markets
on
wednesday
rode
out
the
heavy
parliamentary
defeat
for
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
brexit
deal
as
investors
saw
potential
for
legislative
deadlock
to
force
london
to
delay
its
departure
from
the
eu
may
s
government
faces
a
no
confidence
vote
on
wednesday
after
the
shattering
rejection
left
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
in
disarray
may
is
expected
to
survive
the
vote
but
investors
see
little
sign
of
breakthrough
on
the
brexit
impasse
as
a
result
they
are
increasing
betting
on
britain
being
forced
to
postpone
its
planned
march
exit
though
few
have
any
clarity
on
what
that
would
mean
for
the
country
in
the
longer
run
markets
had
largely
priced
in
the
overnight
defeat
and
in
early
trade
major
european
bourses
mirrored
overall
resilience
in
asian
markets
there
stocks
were
also
lifted
by
signs
that
china
will
take
more
steps
to
bolster
its
slowing
economy
and
the
federal
reserve
may
pause
its
run
of
interest
rate
rises
the
evidence
yesterday
is
that
there
is
a
quorum
of
british
mps
who
will
do
what
s
required
to
avoid
a
brexit
said
chris
scicluna
head
of
economic
research
at
daiwa
capital
markets
in
london
so
there
s
a
strong
probability
of
an
extension
of
article
and
that
means
there
s
an
increased
probability
of
a
softer
brexit
or
no
brexit
at
with
some
expecting
a
delay
to
raise
chances
of
a
softer
brexit
for
example
based
on
the
opposition
labour
party
s
idea
of
membership
of
a
permanent
customs
union
sterling
was
flat
against
the
dollar
at
we
do
think
it
is
unlikely
that
sterling
will
fall
to
fresh
lows
unless
the
current
government
falls
and
that
unlikely
although
the
risk
is
not
zero
said
alvin
tan
an
fx
strategist
at
societe
generale
in
london
volatility
is
expected
to
remain
high
but
we
do
think
that
there
is
upside
for
sterling
sterling
is
very
cheap
on
the
basis
partly
because
of
the
probability
of
the
the
msci
world
equity
index
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
was
flat
while
msci
s
main
european
index
gained
percent
britain
s
leading
equity
index
fell
percent
in
early
trade
lagging
european
stocks
which
climbed
percent
the
broader
euro
stoxx
was
up
percent
while
indexes
in
germany
france
and
spain
all
rose
earlier
in
the
day
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
ticked
up
percent
with
south
korea
s
kospi
and
hong

hang

both
scaling

asian
shares
had
responded
well
to
china
s
central
bank
injecting
a
record
amount
of
money
into
the
country
s
financial
system
that
underscored
chinese
officials
commitment
to
signal
more
measures
to
stabilise
a
slowing
economy
global
markets
have
drawn
succour
from
the
resumption
of
trade
talks
though
scepticism
over
the
absence
of
detailed
progress
was
underlined
overnight
as
the
trade
representative
that
he
did
not
see
any
progress
made
on
structural
issues
during
talks
with
china
last
week
investors
are
also
betting
that
the
federal
reserve
will
slow
its
interest
rate
hikes
on
tuesday
policymakers
agreed
the
federal
reserve
should
pause
further
rate
hikes
until
it
is
clear
how
much
the
economy
will
be
held
back
by
larger
risks
like
slowing
growth
in
china
investors
are
mainly
focused
on
the
outcome
of
the
trade
negotiations
but
it
may
take
more
than
a
month
before
it
will
become
clear
