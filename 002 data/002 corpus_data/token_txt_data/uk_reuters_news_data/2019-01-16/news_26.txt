a

omv
owns
a

omv
said
on
monday
that
the
recoverable
resource
estimate
of
the
find
had
increased
to
million
barrels
of
oil
from
million
barrels
previously
after
drilling
of
an
appraisal
well
at
the

in

mauseth
head
of
omv
s
norwegian
subsidiary
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
an
energy
conference
on

that
the
group
plans
an
initial
investment
of
billion
norwegian

to
develop
the

was

the
preliminary
cost
estimate
wisting
is
norway
s
northernmost
oilfield
located
kilometres
miles
north
of
the
nordic
country
s
mainland
mauseth
said
a
floating
production
storage
and
offloading
fpso
vessel
would
be
used
as
a
production
facility
and
oil
from
the
field
would
be
exported
from
the
field
by
tankers
a
decision
on
the
type
of
fpso
would
be
taken
in
with
production
expected
to
start
in
he
said
the
norwegian
government
is
keen
for
oil
firms
to
develop
new
oil
and
gas
in
the
barents
sea
and
is
considering
building
an
oil
terminal
on
mainland
norway
to
handle
oil
exports
from
offshore
fields
mauseth
however
said
omv
did
not
believe
a
terminal
would
be
economically
viable
if
it
makes
sense
we
are
prepared
to
consider
that
but
so
far
the
numbers
haven
t
been
favourable
it
s
not
economic
to
do
it
that
way
he
told
reuters
on
other
projects
omv
plans
this
year
to
drill
one
appraisal
well
at
its
gas
and
condensate
discovery
in
the
norwegian
sea
one
of
the
largest
finds
off
norway
in
mauseth
said
the
discovery
near
the
morvin
field
so
far
is
estimated
to
hold
billion
cubic
metres
of
gas
and
million
cubic
metres
million
barrels
of
condensate
the
norwegian
petroleum
directorate
the
state
agency
managing
the
nordic
country
s
oil
and
gas
resources
said
the
discovery
was
expected
to
have
a
significant
upside
if
it
the
appraisal
well
provides
good
news
then
we
have
another
development
project
