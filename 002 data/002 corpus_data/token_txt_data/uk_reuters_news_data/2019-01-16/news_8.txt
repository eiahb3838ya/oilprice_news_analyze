democratic
lawmakers
on
wednesday
slammed
president
donald
trump
s
new
pick
to
run
the
environmental
protection
agency
as
a
extremist
but
harbored
little
hope
of
blocking
his
confirmation
in
the
senate
trump
nominated
epa
acting
administrator
andrew
wheeler
to
run
the
agency
permanently
last
week
if
confirmed
wheeler
would
continue
to
push
the
trump
administration
s
deregulatory
and
fuels
agenda
but
without
the
constant
criticism
over
alleged
mismanagement
that
plagued
his
predecessor
scott
pruitt
a
washington
insider
with
years
of
experience
as
a
top
aide
to
republican
senator
jim
inhofe
a
climate
change
doubter
wheeler
has
been
running
the
epa
since
july
when
pruitt
resigned
in
a
flurry
of
controversy
over
his
travel
expenses
and
use
of
resources
and
staff
for
personal
matters
his
nomination
has
pleased
business
groups
but
angered
environmental
advocates
some
of
whom
protested
the
hearing
mr
wheeler
is
certainly
not
the
embarrassment
that
scott
pruitt
proved
to
be
senator
tom
carper
the
top
democrat
on
the
senate
environment
and
public
works
committee
said
at
the
hearing
carper
however
added
mr
wheeler
s
environmental
policies
appear
to
be
just
as
extreme
as
his
predecessor
wheeler
defended
his
record
so
far
at
epa
largely
defined
by
moves
to
undo
or
weaken
environmental
regulations
casting
it
as
a
way
to
reduce
the
regulatory
burden
on
business
while
also
protecting
air
and
water
quality
for
americans
among
his
accomplishments
at
the
epa
wheeler
last
year
finalized
a
proposal
to
replace
federal
curbs
on
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
power
plants
with
a
new
rule
placing
much
of
that
power
in
the
hands
of
states
he
has
also
overseen
the
epa
s
gutting
of
the
justification
for
mercury
emissions
limits
a
proposal
to
reduce
the
number
of
waterways
under
federal
protection
and
efforts
to
lower
targets
for
vehicle
fuel
efficiency
democrats
pressed
wheeler
on
his
record
and
also
his
past
work
lobbying
on
behalf
of
energy
companies
like
underground
coal
giant
murray
energy
a
vocal
proponent
of
reduced
environmental
and
safety
regulation
senator
sheldon
whitehouse
a
rhode
island
democrat
held
up
photos
of
wheeler
attending
meetings
between
murray
s
chief
executive
robert
murray
and
trump
administration
officials
and
asked
wheeler
for
a
full
accounting
of
the
number
of
such
meetings
he
had
arranged
for
the
coal
company
wheeler
said
he
would
provide
a
written
response
democratic
senators
bernie
sanders
of
vermont
and
ed
markey
of
massachusetts
also
attacked
wheeler
for
refusing
to
call
climate
change
the
world
s
most
pressing
crisis
despite
mounting
evidence
it
is
leading
to
potentially
devastating
sea
level
rise
flooding
wildfires
and
and
extreme
weather
you
are
putting
up
a
smokescreen
to
ensure
there
is
an
advancement
of
donald
trump
s
dirty
policies
markey
said
that
s
why
it
is
relevant
that
you
are
a
former
coal
industry
lobbyist
he
added
a
federal
report
written
by
government
agencies
late
last
year
said
climate
change
driven
by
fossil
fuels
consumption
will
cost
the
economy
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
by
the
end
of
the
century
damaging
everything
from
human
health
to
infrastructure
and
agricultural
production
wheeler
said
he
had
been
briefed
on
the
assessment
but
had
several
outstanding
questions
about
it
and
was
waiting
for
further
briefings
from
his
staff
i
would
not
call
it
the
greatest
crisis
wheeler
said
industry
representatives
and
republican
lawmakers
have
largely
praised
wheeler
for
his
deregulatory
stance
arguing
the
epa
has
for
years
hurt
economic
growth
by
imposing
requirements
on
businesses
he
understands
how
the
regulatory
process
works
and
the
type
of
effort
that
is
required
to
develop
effective
and
legally
defensible
regulatory
reforms
