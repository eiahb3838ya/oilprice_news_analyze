of
binding
bids
from

buyers
energy
minister
tomislav
coric
said
on
wednesday
croatia
is
trying
to
diversify
its
energy
sources
but
late
last
year
received
few
bids
for
the
use
of
the
lng
terminal
on
the
northern
adriatic
island
of
krk
which
cast
some
doubt
over
its
viability
it
is
a
strategic
project
and
is
being
implemented
within
that
context
it
is
planned
to
be
used
by
several
countries
not
just
croatia
and
is
part
of
the
european
union
plans
to
diversify
energy
sources
coric
told
the
parliament
while
answering
a
deputy
s
question
he
did
not
elaborate
on
how
the
government
planned
to
financially
support
the
lng
terminal
which
is
tentatively
seen
as
starting
operations
from
the
beginning
of
the
floating
terminal
has
a
planned
capacity
of
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
of
gas
per
year
while
croatia
received
binding
bids
amounting
to
bcm
coric
also
said
croatia
had
also
received
the
letters
of
intent
for
use
of
the
terminal
from
some
hungarian
companies
the
terminal
is
being
partially
financed
by
the
european
union
as
part
of
eu
efforts
to
diversify
away
from
russian
energy
imports
the
targeted
markets
are
countries
in
central
and
southeastern
europe
the
value
of
the
terminal
is
seen
at
million
euros
million
with
the
eu
providing
just
over
million
euros
the
rest
was
originally
planned
to
be
financed
on
commercial
terms
croatia
annually
consumes
gas
volumes
slightly
higher
than
the
terminal
s
planned
capacity
domestic
production
which
has
fallen
in
recent
years
accounts
for
slightly
more
than
percent
of
the
