fuel
continues
accumulating
at
mexico
s
ports
and
storage
terminals
the
government
and
pemex
said
on
wednesday
as
the
government
struggles
to
accelerate
deliveries
to
gas
stations
via
truck
instead
of
speedier
pipelines
in
a
bid
to
halt
rampant
theft
of
gasoline
and
diesel
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
ordered
key
pipelines
closed
starting
in
late
december
which
has
caused
shortages
and
sparked
concerns
about
the
economic
impact
if
the
shortfalls
are
prolonged
mexico
currently
has
almost
million
barrels
of
gasoline
diesel
and
jet
fuel
in
dozens
of
tankers
anchored
around
pemex
s
ports
waiting
to
discharge
some
million
barrels
more
are
stored
at
terminals
said
pemex
chief
executive
octavio
romero
in
a
press
conference
with
lopez
obrador
romero
also
estimated
that
million
barrels
of
fuel
purchased
by
oil
company
pemex
from
different
suppliers
are
on
the
way
due
to
mexico
s
limited
storage
capacity
compared
with
its
fuel
consumption
which
last
year
surpassed
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
pemex
typically
has
a
small
fleet
of
tankers
loaded
with
imported
fuel
at
the
gulf
of
mexico
acting
as
floating
but
the
number
of
vessels
waiting
to
discharge
mostly
bringing
imports
from
the
united
states
has
grown
to
about
tankers
this
week
including
a
group
of
ships
at
ports
on
the
pacific
coast
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
data
mexico
in
november
also
resumed
importing
crude
from
the
united
states
after
more
than
a
decade
by
awarding
refining
firm
phillips
a
tender
to
buy
bakken
crude
a
crude
cargo
arrived
in
the
country
in
december
according
to
lopez
obrador
who
has
vowed
to
reduce
fuel
imports
and
has
been
a
harsh
critic
of
the
country
s
energy
reform
which
opened
up
the
sector
a
drop
in
local
oil
output
which
stands
at
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
led
the
country
to
resort
to
imports
of
light
oil
in
november
and
december
to
make
the
crude
mixtures
required
by
several
local
refineries
the
president
said
we
have
to
replace
production
there
are
two
options
we
buy
light
crude
for
refineries
or
we
buy
gasoline
he
said
during
his
regular
press
conference
we
are
doing
both
but
at
the
same
time
we
want
to
review
with
precision
the
reason
for
the
fall
in
oil
lopez
obrador
s
main
plan
for
the
oil
industry
involves
building
a
new
refinery
to
boost
fuel
production
while
reducing
crude
exports
and
imports
