china
s
cnooc
is
temporarily
storing
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
in
a
tanker
off
south
korea
as
a
warmer
than
usual
winter
cuts
expected
spot
demand
for
the
fuel
industry
sources
said
on
wednesday
china
faced
a
severe
winter
gas
shortage
last
year
after
switching
millions
of
households
to
natural
gas
from
coal
for
heating
prompting
chinese
companies
this
winter
to
secure
supply
well
ahead
of
time
they
said
however
the
winter
so
far
has
been
relatively
mild
and
weather
data
from
refinitiv
eikon
largely
points
towards
warmer
than
usual
temperatures
ahead
leaving
suppliers
with
high
levels
of
inventory
the
lng
tanker
neo
energy
which
has
a
capacity
of
about
cubic
metres
loaded
the
fuel
from
the
bontang
plant
in
indonesia
on
and
has
been
floating
the
cargo
since
then
data
from
refinitiv
eikon
showed
the
vessel
is
currently
anchored
fully
laden
at
jisepo
in
south
korea
china
is
the
world
s
second
largest
lng
importer
but
its
storage
facilities
have
lagged
increasing
demand
prompting
the
government
to
urge
gas
producers
to
build
more
underground
storage
storing
lng
on
tankers
is
generally
seen
as
riskier
than
holding
crude
oil
on
the
water
given
higher
storage
costs
and
the
fact
that
lng
cargoes
degrade
over
time
by
evaporating
storing
the
cargo
offshore
is
part
of
cnooc
s
policy
of
ensuring
that
supply
is
available
in
case
of
an
emergency
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
declining
to
elaborate
a
spokesman
for
cnooc
one
of
china
s
big
three
oil
and
gas
producers
could
not
immediately
be
reached
for
comment
trade
sources
said
the
company
may
have
overbought
cargoes
in
anticipation
of
a
winter
supply
crunch
after
suppliers
were
left
scrambling
last
year
to
find
enough
cargoes
chinese
companies
have
learnt
their
lesson
from
previous
years
and
were
adequately
prepared
this
time
a
trader
familiar
with
the
chinese
market
told
reuters
cnooc
spent
million
in
late
to
lease
two
tankers
including
the
neo
energy
to
store
an
emergency
stash
of
the
fuel
under
a
agreement
to
meet
last
winter
s
demand
reuters
reported
at
the
time
cnooc
parked
the
two
tankers
between
its
receiving
terminals
in
tianjin
in
the
north
and
ningbo
on
the
east
coast
and
moved
the
ships
around
to
pick
up
new
supplies
once
they
were
emptied
a
source
said
asian
lng
prices
are
currently
at
the
lowest
seasonal
average
in
two
years
