stockholm
reuters
after
months
of
deadlock
social
democrat
stefan
lofven
looked
set
for
a
second
term
as
sweden
s
prime
minister
but
he
will
be
walking
a
tightrope
needing
to
placate
both
his
partners
and
the
left
party
to
stay
in
power
the
speaker
said
parliament
would
vote
on
lofven
s
candidacy
on
friday
after
he
struck
a
policy
deal
with
the
centre
and
liberal
parties
and
the
left
party
said
it
would
abstain
in
the
vote
giving
the
former
welder
and
union
leader
the
numbers
he
needs
to
be
elected
but
the
left
party
said
it
would
try
to
pull
the
plug
on
lofven
if
his
government
swung
too
far
to
the
right
raising
that
prospect
that
lofven
will
struggle
to
deliver
on
an
agenda
that
includes
tax
cuts
and
labour
market
reform
we
have
an
agreement
with
four
parties
and
i
plan
to
deliver
on
that
stefan
lofven
told
reporters
what
the
left
party
decides
to
do
that
is
up
to
september
s
election
delivered
a
hung
parliament
with
neither
major
bloc
able
to
rule
without
the
support
of
the
sweden
democrats
a
party
with
roots
in
the
fringe
and
who
hold
the
balance
of
power
after
months
of
wrangling
lofven
agreed
a
historic
deal
bringing
together
the
social
democrats
and
the
greens
who
were
part
of
lofven
s
previous
minority
coalition
with
the
centre
and
liberal
parties
from
the
alliance
lofven
who
intends
to
govern
again
with
the
greens
has
promised
to
drive
a
sharp
swing
to
the
right
in
swedish
politics
the
steep
price
to
be
paid
for
enlisting
centrist
and
liberal
support
however
he
risks
being
held
hostage
by
the
left
party
which
supported
his
previous
government
but
pledged
to
seek
to
bring
down
lofven
if
he
proposes
bills
to
loosen
up
the
tightly
regulated
labour
market
or
ease
rent
control
rules
taboos
for
the
until
now
the
left
party
has
the
power
of
veto
over
this
government
ulf
kristersson
the
head
of
the
moderate
party
told
reporters
saying
his
party
would
try
to
topple
lofven
s
government
at
the
first
opportunity
we
will
not
save
a
government
that
we
think
should
never
have
taken
but
if
lofven
fails
to
deliver
on
the
package
of
measures
he
risks
losing
the
support
of
the
centre
and
liberals
leaving
him
facing
a
difficult
task
of
finding
the
middle
ground
in
the
coming
months
you
can
not
exclude
the
chance
that
we
will
have
another
crisis
