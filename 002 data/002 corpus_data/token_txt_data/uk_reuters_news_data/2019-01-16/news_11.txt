detroit
reuters
executives
at
the
major
automakers
are
pressing
the
trump
administration
and
california
to
agree
on
standards
for
fuel
efficiency
and
carbon
emissions
through
as
risks
increase
that
a
deadline
for
setting
national
standards
will
pass
without
a
deal
automakers
are
already
entering
the
time
frame
when
decisions
should
be
made
about
what
engines
and
technology
such
as
hybrids
or
fully
electric
cars
will
be
in
use
in
and
beyond
executives
said
in
august
the
trump
administration
proposed
freezing
fuel
efficiency
requirements
at
levels
through
and
stripping
california
of
the
ability
to
impose
stricter
rules
the
administration
may
also
eliminate
compliance
credits
that
automakers
get
for
making
electric
vehicles
a
group
of
about
states
led
by
california
has
challenged
the
administration
proposal
as
unlawful
and
promised
to
sue
if
federal
regulators
move
forward
with
the
freeze
trump
s
proposed
freeze
would
result
in
barrels
per
day
more
oil
consumption
by
the
the
administration
says
it
would
reduce
regulatory
costs
for
automakers
by
more
than
billion
billion
pounds
over
the
next
decade
at
a
hearing
wednesday
senator
tom
carper
a
democrat
said
he
had
heard
that
the
trump
administration
now
plans
to
finalise
a
percent
annual
increase
in
the
stringency
of
the
standards
a
rate
that
is
times
weaker
than
the
current
carper
said
that
will
only
lead
to
extensive
litigation
and
uncertainty
for
automakers
that
s
not
a
outcome
it
s
a
several
automakers
said
they
have
heard
the
administration
could
finalise
an
increase
ranging
from
no
increase
to
percent
per
year
but
nothing
has
been
finalised
epa
administrator
nominee
andrew
wheeler
said
at
the
hearing
he
was
still
pushing
for
an
agreement
nobody
wants
a
deal
more
than
i
do
wheeler
said
the
administration
is
supposed
to
finalise
the
new
rules
by
the
end
of
march
in
order
for
the
softer
requirements
to
take
effect
by
the
model
year
but
some
automakers
and
officials
question
if
it
will
meet
that
deadline
in
the
wake
of
the
partial
government
shutdown
most
automakers
oppose
freezing
the
requirements
but
also
want
relief
from
standards
that
called
for
a
roughly
percent
annual
reduction
in
carbon
emissions
targets
that
translate
to
fuel
efficiency
requirements
for
various
classes
of
vehicles
pick
the
middle
pick
percent
and
get
on
with
life

ford
told

very
clear
and
very
open
that
we
want
one
national
standard
we
want
california
at
the
table
ford
said
we
re
not
asking
for
a
rollback
but
we
ve
got
to
get
everybody
at
the
table
