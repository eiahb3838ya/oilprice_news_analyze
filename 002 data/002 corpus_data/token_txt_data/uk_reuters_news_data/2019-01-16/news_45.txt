india
s
soymeal
sales
to
iran
are
set
to
spike
as
the
oil
producer
uses
the
rupees
it
receives
for
its
crude
exports
to
cover
its
animal
feed
demand
amid
sanctions
that
have
crimped
the
country
s
ability
to
import
necessities
iran
has
agreed
to
sell
crude
oil
to
india
the
world
s
oil
consumer
in
exchange
for
rupees
after
sanctions
imposed
by
the
united
states
blocked
its
access
to
the
global
financial
system
the
country
must
spend
those
rupees
on
indian
goods
and
iran
does
not
produce
enough
of
the
soymeal
domestically
higher
meal
exports
will
support
indian
soybean
prices
and
limit
the
complaints
from
farmers
that
had
demanded
relief
from
low
prices
from
the
government
which
faces
elections
by
may
india
s
soymeal
exports
to
iran
could
jump
to
tonnes
during
the
fiscal
year
ending
in
march
up
from
just
tonnes
during
the
previous
fiscal
year
mehta
executive
director
of
the
solvent
extractors
association
sea
a
industry
body
for
oilseed
processors
said
this
week
exports
could
rise
to
tonnes
during
the
next
fiscal
year
if
the
sanctions
remain
he
added
iran
has
started
buying
aggressively
due
to
the
sanctions
and
it
seems
demand
will
remain
there
in
coming
months
said
mehta
india
started
paying
iran
for
oil
imports
in
rupees
after
receiving
a
waiver
from
the
sanctions
that
started
in
november
india
wants
to
continue
buying
oil
from
iran
since
it
offers
free
shipping
and
an
extended
credit
period
while
iran
will
use
the
rupee
funds
to
mostly
pay
for
indian
exports
iran
is
paying
a
premium
of
as
much
as
percent
compared
to
other
buyers
since
the
country
was
struggling
to
secure
soymeal
from
other
sellers
and
keen
to
use
oil
payments
said
an
exporter
based
at
indore
in
central
indian
state
of
madhya
pradesh
we
have
to
charge
a
premium
as
many
times
payments
get
delayed
he
said
during
the
previous
sanctions
india
settled
percent
of
its
iranian
oil
payments
in
rupees
and
the
remainder
in
euros
but
this
time
new
delhi
wanted
to
make
all
payments
in
rupees
to
reduce
its
trade
deficit
with
iran
local
soybean
prices
have
jumped
percent
in
just
three
weeks
as
oil
mills
started
procuring
the
oilseed
to
fulfill
the
export
orders
for
iran
however
soymeal
prices
have
also
jumped
and
made
indian
exports
less
lucrative
for
traditional
buyers
such
as
south
korea
thailand
vietnam
and
bangladesh
indian
soymeal
was
available
at
about
per
tonne
on
a
fob
basis
compared
to
for
south
american
supplies
said
a
dealer
with
a
global
trading
firm
in
coming
months
thailand
and
vietnam
are
likely
to
switch
to
brazil
and
argentina
their
supplies
are
cheaper
even
after
factoring
in
higher
freight
cost
the
dealer
said
still
india
s
soymeal
exports
could
jump
percent
in
the
fiscal
year
to
million
tonnes
