canada's oil cuts offer lifeline to producers but create new problems
winnipeg

the
canadian
province
of
alberta
s
decision
to
force
production
cuts
is
benefiting
oil
companies
with
higher
prices
but
it
is
also
pushing
capital
elsewhere
and
threatens
to
undermine
booming
shipments
after
alberta
cut
barrels
per
day
bpd
starting
this
month
the
discount
on
canadian
heavy
oil
compared
to
benchmark
crude
oil
shrank
to
less
than
per
barrel
from
more
than
in
october
providing
relief
for
producers
but
drilling
activity
has
dropped
sharply
in
the
last
year
hurting
service
providers
and
the
shrinking
discount
reduces
incentive
for
shippers
to
move
crude
by
rail
which
is
costlier
than
pipelines
some
producers
have
already
decided
to
spend
more
in
other
provinces
as
soon
as
we
heard
this
curtailment
was
taking
place
we
shifted
our
capital
to
saskatchewan
from
alberta
said
grant
fagerheim
chief
executive
of
producer
whitecap
resources
inc
whitecap
intends
to
spend
about
percent
of
its
c
million
million
capex
in
saskatchewan
up
from
its
usual
spending
there
of
around
percent
fagerheim
said
canada
is
the
world
s
crude
producer
but
larger
producers
like
the
united
states
saudi
arabia
and
russia
do
not
face
canada
s
obstacles
in
getting
oil
to
market
full
pipelines
and
aggressive
opposition
to
expanding
the
industry
meant
that
even
as
canada
s
production
hit
record
levels
last
year
benefits
of
that
boom
were
elusive
alberta
which
produces
most
of
canada
s
oil
last
month
ordered
curtailments
to
drain
bloated
storage
tanks
and
boost
prices
government
intervention
has
provided
a
lifeline
to
producers
that
were
selling
barrels
at
a
loss
late
last
year
and
avoided
an
economic
catastrophe
for
canada
bonterra
energy
corp
produces
less
than
bpd
making
it
exempt
from
requirements
to
curb
output
but
it
still
benefits
from
higher
prices
chief
executive
george
fink
said
cenovus
energy
inc
which
announced
plans
last
year
to
increase
shipments
by
rail
is
seeing
a
very
positive
impact
on
cash
flow
due
to
small
price
discounts
senior
vice
president
of
downstream
keith
chiasson
told
reuters
but
with
growth
capital
leaving
alberta
and
transportation
problems
unresolved
producers
are
feeling
their
way
along
in
the
early
days
of
reckoning
with
almost
unprecedented
challenges
across
canada
rigs
were
working
as
of
down
rigs
from
a
year
earlier
according
to
baker
hughes
data
companies
that
provide
contract
services
for
producers
such
as
drilling
are
looking
to
the
united
states
and
mexico
said
gary
mar
chief
executive
of
the
petroleum
services
association
of
canada
production
cuts
worsened
an
already
grim
situation
for
service
companies
mar
said
asked
about
the
curtailment
program
s
unintended
consequences
an
alberta
government
spokesman
noted
that
its
strategy
was
focused
on
getting
top
dollar
for
its
oil
there
s
too
much
at
stake
and
we
shouldn
t
be
selling
our
products
on
the
cheap
said
mike
mckinnon
spokesman
for
alberta
s
energy
minister
but
prices
have
improved
so
dramatically
that
shipping
by
rail
the
backup
plan
for
moving
crude
until
new
pipelines
are
built
makes
less
economic
sense
the
cost
of
shipping
crude
by
rail
to
buyers
is
estimated
around
to
per
barrel
well
above
the
current
differential
cenovus
would
not
comment
on
whether
the
company
is
losing
money
on
rail
shipments
but
said
they
are
scheduled
to
ramp
up
in
the
second
quarter
once
new
cars
arrive
devon
energy
corp
was
planning
to
move
percent
of
its
canadian
heavy
oil
this
year
by
rail
but
the
narrow
differentials
now
make
that
an
unlikely
target
said
rob
dutton
devon
s
senior
vice
president
of
canadian
operations
devon
currently
moves
less
than
percent
by
train
it
s
more
difficult
now
to
reach
that
level
dutton
said
in
an
interview
days
ago
i
would
have
said
absolutely
for
canadian
dollars
