flocked
to
safety
in
the
face
of
a
rapidly
escalating
trade
conflict
soybeans
were
among
the
hardest
hit
after
president
donald
trump
threatened
to
impose
a
percent
tariff
on
another
billion
of
chinese
goods
a
threat
that
china
s
commerce
ministry
described
as
blackmailing
vowing
to
retaliate

the

more
measured
than
that
of

in
china
the
shanghai

index
slumped
nearly
percent
at
one
point
a
preference
for
more
sectors
such
as

showed
investors
were
trying
to
insulate
themselves
from
a
trade
war
according
to
jack
ablin
chief
investment
officer
at
cresset
wealth
in
chicago
investors
recognize
that
china
sells
us
about
four
times
the
amount
of
products
we
sell
them
so
any
diminishment
in
trade
is
going
to
hurt
them
that
much
more
said
ablin
if
they
were
really
concerned
we
were
spiraling
down

investors
in
agricultural
commodities
appeared
to
be
far
more
worried
ablin
said
trump
may
be
willing
to
suffer
pain
in
commodities
in
a
spat
that
