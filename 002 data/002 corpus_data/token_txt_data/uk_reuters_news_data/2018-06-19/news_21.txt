update 2-scottish government wins fracking case against ineos
reuters
scotland
s
highest
court
ruled
against
petrochemicals
company
ineos
on
tuesday
after
it
challenged
a
devolved
scottish
government
moratorium
against
fracking
for
oil
and
gas
ineos
headed
by
billionaire
founder
jim
ratcliffe
argued
the
scottish
government
had
imposed
an
unlawful
ban
on
fracking
in
october
and
had
sought
a
judicial
review
to
overturn
it
the
court
of
session
said
the
government
had
not
imposed
a
ban
despite
several
statements
to
that
effect
and
had
instead
an
emerging
and
unfinalised
planning
policy
expressing
no
support
on
the
part
of
the
scottish
government
for
fracking
the
extraction
of
oil
and
gas
from
tight
rocks
by
fracturing
them
using
chemicals
has
become
a
contentious
issue
in
europe
after
it
helped
reverse
a
fall
in
oil
output
transformed
its
gas
sector
and
boosted
the
economy
of
several
states
despite
that
fracking
is
also
associated
with
environmental
issues
such
as
increased
industrial
activity
fears
over
water
contamination
and
objections
that
it
boosts
fossil
fuel
production
when
more
renewable
energy
should
be
encouraged
ineos
operates
a
refinery
at
grangemouth
down
the
firth
of
forth
and
ships
shale
gas
from
the
united
states
to
supply
it
it
holds
the
rights
expiring
on
june
to
explore
for
gas
over
a
km
area
between
glasgow
and
falkirk
the
devolved
scottish
government
announced
last
october
it
was
against
fracking
in
line
with
public
opinion
it
ordered
local
authorities
to
reject
planning
applications
from
companies
seeking
to
frack
a
measure
that
energy
minister
paul
wheelhouse
told
parliament
was
sufficient
to
effectively
ban
the
development
of
unconventional
oil
and
gas
extraction
the
decision
that
i
am
announcing
means
that
fracking
can
not
and
will
not
take
place
in
scotland
he
said
then
judge
lord
pentland
said
despite
such
ministerial
statements
which
he
cited
in
the
court
opinion
there
is
indeed
no
prohibition
against
fracking
in
force
at
the
present
time
ineos
welcomed
the
court
s
decision
which
it
said
clarified
the
confusion
arising
out
of
government
announcements
today
s
judgement
makes
it
clear
the
snp
government
will
now
have
to
make
decisions
based
on
facts
and
science
rather
than
prejudice
and
political
expediency
it
said
with
an
environmental
assessment
and
business
and
regulatory
assessments
still
to
be
carried
out
there
may
never
be
a
fracking
ban
in
wheelhouse
said
in
reaction
to
the
court
ruling
that
the
government
s
position
against
fracking
remained
unchanged
just
over
miles
south
of
the
border
