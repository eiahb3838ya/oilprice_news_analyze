oil
prices
fell
in
early
asian
trading
on
tuesday
on
expectations
that
producer
cartel
opec
and
key
ally
russia
will
gradually
increase
output
after
withholding
supplies
since
brent
crude
futures
the
international
benchmark
for
oil
prices
were
at
per
barrel
at
gmt
down
cents
or
percent
from
their
last
close
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
futures
were
at
a
barrel
down
cents
or
percent
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
together
with
a
group
of
producers
that
includes
russia
started
withholding
oil
supplies
in
to
end
a
global
glut
and
prop
up
prices
following
a
sharp
increase
in
crude
prices
from
their
per

lows
in
the
group
on
june
will
meet
in
vienna
austria
to
discuss
forward
policy
greg
mckenna
chief
market
strategist
at
futures
brokerage
axitrader
said
there
would
likely
be
oil
price
volatility
in
the
week
ahead
of
the
meeting
opec
is
fractured
or
fracturing
mckenna
said
as
iran
venezuela
and
iraq
seek
to
veto
the
production
increase
we
could
be
seeing
the
relationship
between
the
saudis
and
russia
pushing
opec
into
second
place
he
added
rob
thummel
managing
director
at
asset
management
firm
tortoise
said
he
would
recommend
a
small
increase
in
production
as
the
global
oil
market
is
potentially
vulnerable
to
an
oil
price
spike
due
to
low
inventories
we
believe
that
opec
will
act
like
a
central
bank
going
forward
raising
and
lowering
production
as
necessary
with
an
objective
of
keeping
global
oil
inventories
at
normal
levels
thummel
said
the
other
key
development
for
global
markets
is
the
escalating
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
in
which
both
sides
have
threatened
stiff
tariffs
on
each
others
key
export
goods
if
implemented
china
may
react
to
tariffs
by
putting
a
percent
duty
on
crude
oil
imports
which
have
been
surging
since
to
a
business
now
worth
almost
billion
per
month

mackenzie
said
the
united
states
would
find
it
hard
to
find
an
alternative
market
that
is
as
big
as
china
