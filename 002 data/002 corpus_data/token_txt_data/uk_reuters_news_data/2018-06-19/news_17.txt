an

the
stockholm
arbitration
court
in
february
was
meant
to
conclude
a
legal

with
a
value
greater
than

naftogaz
said
in
a
statement
it
said
here
the
ruling
had
been
made
by
the
commercial
court
in
london
on
june
gazprom
said
on
tuesday
it
was
aware
that
naftogaz
is
taking
efforts
to
make
the
ruling
of
the
stockholm
court
effective
in
britain
gazprom
will
continue
defending
its
rights
in
accordance
with
the
applicable
legislation
the

said
in
an
emailed
comment
it
was
not
clear
what
assets
gazprom
has
in
england
and
wales
that
could
be
affected
gazprom
marketing
and
trading
here
has
its
headquarters
in
london
where
it
has
more
than
employees
according
to
its
web
site
earlier
this
month
naftogaz
said
courts
in
the
netherlands
and
switzerland
had
approved
decisions
to
freeze
assets
of
gazprom
for
its
part
the
russian
gas
giant
said
it
had
won
an
interim
appeals
court
ruling
in
sweden
that
suspends
attempts
by
naftogaz
to
seize
its
foreign
assets
naftogaz
has
said
that
it
would
request
that
the
decision
be
reversed
the
swedish
court
ruling
does
not
suspend
the
award
itself
it
only
suspends
enforcement
in
sweden
naftogaz
quoted
its
ceo
andriy
kobolyev
as
saying
the
transit
award
remains
valid
and
interest
continues
to
accrue
and
we
will
seek
enforcement
in
jurisdictions
where
enforcement
is
an
option
