norway
s
trillion
wealth
fund
s
process
to
blacklist
firms
for
producing
too
much
greenhouse
gases
has
taken
longer
than
expected
but
recent
clarifications
from
its
ethics
watchdog
could
mean
a
decision
is
near
a
top
official
told
reuters
the
fund
is
the
world
s
largest
sovereign
wealth
fund
with
stakes
in
over
companies
worldwide
it
is
forbidden
from
investing
in
firms
that
produce
nuclear
weapons
or
landmines
or
are
involved
in
the
production
of
tobacco
among
other
criteria
carbon
emissions
became
a
criteria
for
exclusion
from
the
fund
in
and
last
year
the
council
on
ethics
recommended
a
small
handful
of
firms
be
excluded
for
producing
too
much
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
either
the
oil
cement
and
steel
sectors
since
then
recommendations
have
been
under
review
with
the
board
of
the
central
bank
which
oversees
the
fund
we
sent
a
letter
to
the
council
for
further
interpretation
of
that
criteria
and
we
just
now
got
an
answer
so
the
process
is
moving
forward
deputy
central
bank
governor
egil
matsen
told
reuters
we
will
deal
with
the
reply
internally
in
the
bank
during
the
next
weeks
and
months
but
i
can
t
say
exactly
how
long
it
will
take
matsen
said
adding
that
the
dialogue
with
the
council
had
been
extensive
he
said
the
main
difficulty
had
been
to
define
and
limit
this
new
type
of
criteria
based
on
the
companies
conduct
or
behavior
rather
than
their
products
