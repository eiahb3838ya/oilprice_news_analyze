small
shale
producers
which
powered
development
of
the
sector
in
the
united
states
are
struggling
to
break
into
argentina
due
to
financing
difficulties
and
lack
of
infrastructure
analysts
and
industry
sources
say
the
vaca
muerta
deposit
located
in
western
argentina
is
a
play
regarded
as
the
world
s
shale
gas
development
successive
governments
in
argentina
have
targeted
vaca
muerta
as
the
means
of
reversing
its
energy
deficit
but
its
development
has
been
hindered
by
lack
of
infrastructure
juan
jose
aranguren
who
was
replaced
on
saturday
as
argentina
s
energy
minister
said
last
week
the
investment
by
and
companies
was
essential
to
reduce
costs
at
vaca
muerta
to
unlock
argentina
s
shale
potential
argentina
has
the
world
s
no
shale
gas
and
no
shale
oil
reserves

year

holding

equinor
formerly
known
as
statoil
announced
investments
in
vaca
muerta
despite
efforts
by
the
national
government
and
the
regional
government
of
neuquen
one
of
the
states
spanned
by
vaca
muerta
few
small
shale
firms
have
been
willing
to
invest

subsidiary
of

miguel
galuccio
are
the
only
two
small
firms
with
their
own
independent
operations
in
vaca
muerta
even
if
the
returns
are
enormous
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
startup
costs
in
vaca
muerta
are
very
high
and
there
is
a
considerable
risk
involved
said
david
tawil
president
of
maglan
capital
the
largest
shareholder
in
madalena
energy
a
small
cap
oil
company
that
chose
to
partner
with
pan

llc
to
enter
vaca
muerta
madalena
energy
hopes
to
start
trading
on
the
buenos
aires
stock
exchange
in
the
coming
months
vista
oil
has
said
it
expects
to
start
producing
from
its
first
oil
in
vaca
muerta
in
the
first
quarter
of
next
year
retama
is
planning
to
drill
between
four
and
five
horizontal
wells
and
start
selling
gas
in
the
second
half
of
industry
sources
and
analysts
told
reuters
that
lack
of
financing
high
costs
and
lack
of
infrastructure
makes
vaca
muerta
unappetising
for
companies
with
scant
resources
the
shale
revolution
in
the
united
states
was
done
by
small
companies
which
requires
more
players
and
more
diversification
you
need
investment
which
is
not
only
carried
out
by
the
majors
said
an
industry
source
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
at
the
giant
eagle
ford
shale
field
in
texas
there
are
currently
more
than
companies
operating
in
the
united
states
financing
costs
are
much
lower
and
shale
producing
areas
have
been
better
explored
considerably
reducing
the
risk
for
companies
investing
there
tawil
said
that
is
not
the
case
however
for
vaca
muerta
argentina
s
central
bank
hiked
its
benchmark
interest
rate
to
percent
last
month
the
highest
in
the
world
and
supplies
of
credit
from
local
banks
are
drying
up
the
central
bank
announced
plans
on
monday
to
raise
reserve
requirements
for
local
banks
the
big
challenge
in
argentina
is
going
to
be
capital
the
financial
system
is
small
