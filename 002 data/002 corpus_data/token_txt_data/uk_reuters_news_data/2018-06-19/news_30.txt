chinese
stocks
fell
almost
percent
and
alarm
bells
rang
across
global
markets
on
tuesday
as
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
china
escalated
further
the
yuan
also
hit
a
low
overnight
after
president
donald
trump
threatened
to
impose
a
percent
tariff
on
another
billion
of
chinese
goods
beijing
in
turn
warned
about
billion
of
retaliatory
penalties
on
goods
asian
stocks
wilted
to
a
low
and
australia
s
dollar
south
africa
s
rand
and
the
euro
were
among
a
diverse
group
of
currencies
caught
in
the
crossfire
europe
s
main
equity
benchmarks
sank
to
percent
and
wall
street
futures
were
pointing
to
similar
declines
while
government
bonds
and
the
japanese
yen
rallied
as
investors
sought
protection
you
only
have
to
look
at
how
far
the
main
shanghai
index
has
fallen
to
see
that
people
would
probably
want
some
assets
at
this
point
said
dz
bank
analyst
andy
cossor
china
s
falls
came
after
it
had
warned
it
would
take
qualitative
and
quantitative
measures
if
the
government
published
an
additional
list
of
tariffs
on
its
products
the
trade
frictions
have
unnerved
financial
markets
with
investors
and
businesses
increasingly
worried
that
a
trade
battle
could
derail
global
growth
trump
appears
to
be
employing
a
similar
tactic
he
used
with
north
korea
by
blustering
first
in
order
to
gain
an
advantage
in
negotiations
said
kota
hirayama
senior
emerging
markets
economist
at
smbc
nikko
securities
in
tokyo
the
problem
is
such
a
tactic
is
unlikely
to
work
with
shares
of
planemaker
boeing
which
have
acted
as
a
proxy
for
china
tensions
in
recent
months
as
it
is
the
single
largest
exporter
to
the
country
fell
percent
premarket
moves
overnight
the
shanghai
composite
index
had
slumped
nearly
percent
at
one
point
to
its
lowest
level
since
as
more
than
stocks
slumped
by
their
percent
daily
limit
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
also
shed
as
much
percent
and
msci
s
index
fell
percent
to
its
lowest
since
early
december
the
losses
had
intensified
through
the
day
as
the
rout
deepened
in
china
china
s
economy
is
already
clouded
by
a
sharp
slowdown
in
fixed
asset
investment
growth
because
of
the
government
s
drive
a
problematic
property
sector
mounting
debt
and
rising
credit
defaults
the
rising
risk
of
a
disruptive
trade
conflict
makes
a
bad
situation
tentatively
worse
economists
at
nomura
wrote
japan
s
nikkei
lost
percent
and
south
korea
s
kospi
retreated
percent
australian
stocks
bucked
the
trend
and
stayed
steady
helped
by
a
depreciating
currency
and
an
overnight
bounce
in
commodity
prices
the
dollar
fell
percent
to
yen
following
trump
s
tariff
comments
the
yen
is
often
sought
in
times
of
market
turmoil
and
political
tensions
most
other
currencies
lost
against
the
dollar
though
the
currency
gained
percent
on
the
euro
to
a
near
high
at
the
skid
by
china
s
yuan
to
a
low
was
its
biggest
fall
in
a
year
and
a
half
the
australian
dollar
often
considered
a
proxy
for
trades
brushed
a
low
of
too
in
the
global
environment
and
due
in
particular
to
this
trade
issue
the
risks
are
more
on
the
downward
side
and
a
little
bit
worrying
european
central
bank
policymaker
jan
smets
said
in
a
cnbc
interview
basically
it
is
not
good
with
russia
and
saudi
arabia
pushing
for
higher
output
crude
oil
markets
remained
volatile
ahead
of
friday
s
opec
meeting
brent
crude
futures
fell
percent
to
a
barrel
after
rallying
percent
overnight
while
light
crude
futures
retreated
percent
to
assets
gained
on
the
latest
round
of
trade
threats
spot
gold
was
steady
at
an
ounce
the
treasury
note
yield
yields
move
inversely
to
price
touched
percent
its
lowest
since
june
most
european
yields
dropped
too
with
germany
s
government
bund
the
benchmark
for
the
region
at
a
low
of
percent
at
the
same
time
italian
government
bonds
which
are
considered
less
safe
and
have
suffered
from
recent
domestic
political
ructions
sold
off
with
their
yields
up
bps
at
percent
but
the
stress
was
highest
in
emerging
markets
where
the
average
yield
on
domestic
currency
debt
was
the
highest
since
march
and
fast
approaching
percent
industrial
metals
also
buckled
with
copper
tumbling
percent
in
its
ninth
fall
in
the
last
sessions
and
nickel
down
percent
escalation
of
trade
tensions
is
a
sort
of
impossible
thing
to
forecast
but
if
it
stops
at
this
level
you
have
probably
created
some
nice
risk
premia
in
asia
and
emerging
markets
said
hans
peterson
global
head
of
asset
allocation
at
seb
investment
management
so
if
it
doesn
t
get
worse
it
is
probably
a
buying
