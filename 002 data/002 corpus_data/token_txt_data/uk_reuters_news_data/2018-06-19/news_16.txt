tumbled
on
tuesday
with

futures
hitting
lows
not
seen
in
nearly
a
decade
as
president
donald
trump
threatened
more
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
stoking
fears
of
an
increasingly
hostile
trade
war
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
trump
s
threat
followed
his
administration
s
announcement
of
tariffs
on

of
chinese
goods
last
week
which
triggered
retaliatory
tariffs
by
beijing
on
a

billion
worth
of
soybeans
last
year
the
single
most
valuable
agricultural
export
product
to
its
asian
rival
trade
jitters
have
slammed
agricultural
markets
over
the
past
two
weeks
on
worries
that
china
the
largest
importer
of
soybeans
pork
and
cotton
would
slow
or
halt
purchases
of
those
and
other
farm
goods
when
you
get
in
a
fight
with
your
biggest
buyer
of
agriculture
and
the
world
s
largest
soybean
buyer
even
if
they
were
to
buy
percent
less
it
s
a
big
deal
said
dan
basse
president
of
consultancy
agresource
chicago
board
of
trade
soybeans
fell
as
much
as
percent
and
wheat
slumped
more
than
percent

notched

the
trade
fight
with
china
comes
amid
elevated
trade
tensions
with
several
other
top
farm
product
importers
including
mexico
and
canada
over
washington
s
tariffs
on
imported
steel
and
aluminum
crop
farmers
have
lost
an
estimated
per
acre
in
revenue
with
the
swift
escalation
in
trade
tensions
over
the
past
two
weeks
the
most
rapid
erosion
of
farm
profit
since
at
least
basse
said
the
steep
grain
slump
rippled
across
agricultural
commodities
markets
with
prices
for
hogs
and
cattle
which
normally
benefit
from
cheap

lean

shed
more
than
percent
of

jitters
and
a

triggered
broad

by
commodity

one
point
