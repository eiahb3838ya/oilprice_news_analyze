chinese
stocks
fell
almost
percent
and
alarm
bells
rang
across
global
markets
on
tuesday
as
the
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
escalated
further
the
yuan
also
hit
a
low
overnight
after
president
donald
trump
s
threat
to
impose
a
percent
tariff
on
another
billion
of
chinese
goods
drew
warnings
from
beijing
about
billion
of
retaliatory
penalties
on
goods
asian
stocks
wilted
to
a
low
and
australia
s
dollar
and
south
africa
s
rand
were
among
a
diverse
group
of
currencies
caught
in
the
crossfire
europe
s
main
equity
benchmarks
sank
to
percent
in
early
trading
and
wall
street
futures
were
pointing
to
similar
falls
there
later
while
government
bonds
and
the
japanese
yen
rallied
as
investors
sought
protection
you
only
have
to
look
at
how
far
the
main
shanghai
index
has
fallen
to
see
that
people
would
probably
want
some
assets
at
this
point
said
dz
bank
analyst
andy
cossor
china
had
warned
it
will
take
qualitative
and
quantitative
measures
if
the
government
publishes
an
additional
list
of
tariffs
on
its
products
the
trade
frictions
have
unnerved
financial
markets
with
investors
and
businesses
increasingly
worried
that
a
trade
battle
could
derail
global
growth
trump
appears
to
be
employing
a
similar
tactic
he
used
with
north
korea
by
blustering
first
in
order
to
gain
an
advantage
in
negotiations
said
kota
hirayama
senior
emerging
markets
economist
at
smbc
nikko
securities
in
tokyo
the
problem
is
such
a
tactic
is
unlikely
to
work
with
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
fell
percent
to
its
lowest
since
early
december
the
losses
had
intensified
through
the
day
as
the
rout
deepened
in
china
the
shanghai
composite
index
slumped
nearly
percent
at
one
point
to
its
lowest
level
since
while
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
shed
as
much
percent
before
ending
percent
down
china
s
economy
is
already
clouded
by
a
sharp
slowdown
in
fixed
asset
investment
growth
due
to
the
government
s
deleveraging
drive
a
problematic
property
sector
a
mounting
debt
burden
and
rising
credit
defaults
economists
at
nomura
wrote
the
rising
risk
of
a
disruptive
trade
conflict
makes
a
bad
situation
tentatively
japan
s
nikkei
lost
percent
south
korea
s
kospi
retreated
percent
while
australian
stocks
bucked
the
trend
and
added
percent
helped
by
a
depreciating
currency
and
an
overnight
bounce
in
commodity
prices
the
dollar
fell
percent
to
yen
following
trump
s
tariff
comments
the
yen
is
often
sought
in
times
of
market
turmoil
and
political
tensions
it
made
ground
on
the
euro
in
early
european
trading
however
to
stand
percent
higher
at
china
s
yuan
skidded
to
a
low
the
australian
dollar
often
seen
as
a
proxy
for
trades
brushed
a
low
of
with
russia
and
saudi
arabia
pushing
for
higher
output
crude
oil
markets
remained
volatile
ahead
of
friday
s
opec
meeting
brent
crude
futures
fell
percent
to
a
barrel
after
rallying
percent
overnight
while
light
crude
futures
retreated
percent
to
assets
gained
on
the
latest
round
of
trade
threats
spot
gold
was
up
percent
at
an
ounce
albeit
after
its
sharpest
drop
in
years
late
last
week
the
treasury
note
yield
touched
percent
its
lowest
since
june
most
european
bond
yields
dropped
too
with
germany
s
government
bund
the
benchmark
for
the
region
at
a
low
of
percent
italian
government
bonds
which
are
considered
less
safe
and
have
suffered
from
recent
domestic
political
ructions
sold
off
with
their
yields
up
bps
at
percent
but
the
stress
was
highest
in
emerging
markets
where
the
average
yield
on
domestic
currency
debt
was
the
highest
since
march
and
fast
approaching
percent
escalation
of
trade
tensions
is
a
sort
of
impossible
thing
to
forecast
but
if
it
stops
at
this
level
you
have
probably
created
some
nice
risk
premia
in
asia
and
emerging
markets
said
hans
peterson
global
head
of
asset
allocation
at
seb
investment
management
so
if
it
doesn
t
get
worse
it
is
probably
a
buying
