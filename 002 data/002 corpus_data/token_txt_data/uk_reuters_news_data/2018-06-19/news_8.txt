update 3-iran rules out opec deal as russia, saudi push for oil output hike
reuters
iran
said
on
tuesday
opec
was
unlikely
to
reach
a
deal
on
oil
output
this
week
setting
the
stage
for
a
clash
with
saudi
arabia
and
russia
which
are
pushing
to
raise
production
steeply
from
july
to
meet
growing
global
demand
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
meets
on
friday
to
set
output
policy
amid
calls
from
president
donald
trump
and
china
to
cool
down
oil
prices
and
support
the
global
economy
by
producing
more
crude
opec
s
de
facto
leader
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
proposed
gradually
relaxing
production
cuts
in
place
since
the
start
of
while
opec
members
iran
iraq
venezuela
and
algeria
have
opposed
such
a
move
i
don
t
believe
at
this
meeting
we
can
reach
agreement
opec
is
not
the
organization
to
receive
instruction
from
president
trump
opec
is
not
part
of
the
department
of
energy
of
the
united
states
iran
s
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
told
reporters
after
arriving
in
vienna
where
opec
is
headquartered
zanganeh
said
he
would
leave
vienna
on
friday
before
opec
holds
talks
with
producers
the
next
day
and
added
a
recent
rise
in
oil
prices
was
mainly
the
fault
of
washington
which
imposed
new
sanctions
on
opec
members
iran
and
venezuela
trump
has
called
on
opec
to
raise
output
and
saudi
arabia
and
russia
said
in
recent
weeks
the
world
needed
more
oil
oil
demand
usually
grows
at
the
steepest
pace
in
the
third
quarter
we
could
face
a
deficit
if
we
don
t
take
measures
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
on
tuesday
in
our
view
this
could
lead
to
market
novak
said
russia
wanted
opec
and
to
raise
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
effectively
wiping
out
existing
production
cuts
of
million
bpd
that
have
helped
rebalance
the
market
in
the
past
months
and
lifted
oil
prices
to
per
barrel
from
as
low
as
in
in
addition
to
iran
opec
members
iraq
venezuela
and
algeria
said
they
opposed
a
production
increase
despite
supply
outages
in
countries
such
as
libya
and
venezuela
demand
growth
has
surprised
market
watchers
on
the
upside
in
the
past
two
years
with
annual
increases
exceeding
percent
global
oil
consumption
is
expected
to
hit
million
bpd
next
year
novak
said
that
if
a
decision
were
taken
this
week
to
raise
output
opec
and
its
allies
could
meet
again
in
september
to
review
the
impact
and
production
policy
iraq
and
iran
have
said
they
would
oppose
output
increases
on
the
grounds
that
such
moves
would
breach
previous
agreements
to
maintain
cuts
until
the
both
countries
would
struggle
to
increase
output
iran
faces
renewed
sanctions
that
will
impact
its
oil
industry
and
iraq
has
production
constraints
two
opec
sources
told
reuters
that
even
saudi
arabia
s
gulf
allies
kuwait
and
oman
were
against
big
immediate
increases
in
output
one
opec
source
said
the
proposal
of
a
increase
was
just
a
tactic
aimed
at
persuading
fellow
members
to
compromise
on
a
smaller
rise
of
around
million
bpd
saudi
arabia
and
its
gulf
allies
have
the
capacity
to
raise
output
russia
has
also
said
that
limiting
supply
for
too
long
could
encourage
unacceptably
high
output
growth
from
the
united
states
which
is
not
part
of
the
production
agreement
on
tuesday
the
head
of
russia
s
oil
firm
lukoil
vagit
alekperov
said
global
production
cuts
should
be
halved
and
that
lukoil
could
restore
its
oil
output
levels
within
two
to
three
months
commerzbank
commodities
analyst
carsten
fritsch
said
that
given
big
differences
in
the
positions
of
opec
members
the
friday
meeting
was
likely
to
be
tough
unanimity
is
needed
for
any
opec
decision
this
recalls
the
june
meeting
when
opec
was
unable
to
agree
on
an
increase
in
production
to
compensate
for
the
outages
in
libya
fritsch
said
that
meeting
ended
without
any
joint
declaration
the
then
saudi
oil
minister
ali
described
it
as
the
worst
opec
meeting
of
all
adding
to
the
tensions
iran
and
venezuela
continued
to
insist
that
opec
on
friday
debate
sanctions
against
the
two
countries
but
the
organization
s
secretariat
has
rejected
their
requests
according
to
letters
