the
world
must
reject
fear
and
despondency
wrought
by
political
setbacks
and
protect
gains
to
tackle
climate
change
such
as
the
paris
agreement
norway
s
former
prime
minister
said
in
an
interview
on
tuesday
decisions
such
as
president
donald
trump
s
move
to
pull
out
of
the
paris
deal
mark
a
tipping
point
for
the
climate
gro
harlem
brundtland
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
if
meaningful
action
is
not
taken
to
protect
our
gains
in
the
face
of
fear
and
despondency
the
damage
to
our
ecosystem
could
be
irreparable
said
brundtland
norway
s
first
female
prime
minister
trump
announced
last
year
his
decision
to
abandon
the
paris
accord
claiming
it
would
cost
the
united
states
trillions
of
dollars
in
lost
jobs
and
damage
to
business
the
reaction
to
president
trump
s
decision
both
inside
the
united
states
and
abroad
paradoxically
gives
us
hope
brundtland
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
biennial
barbara
ward
lecture
convened
by
the
international
institute
for
environment
and
development
in
london
below
the
federal
level
states
cities
businesses
and
citizens
have
made
it
clear
they
reject
the
administration
s
climate
policies
and
are
committed
to
making
paris
succeed
she
said
an
equally
urgent
task
said
brundtland
is
to
figure
out
how
to
finance
climate
action
worldwide
brundtland
said
wealthy
countries
must
financially
support
developing
nations
shift
to
a
future
for
example
by
finding
private
investment
for
green
technologies
such
as
electric
cars
this
is
a
matter
of
climate
justice
she
said
the
poorest
countries
in
the
world
did
not
create
the
problem
but
they
are
suffering
first
and
worst
from
its
the
paris
climate
deal
agreed
upon
by
nearly
nations
set
a
goal
of
keeping
the
rise
in
average
global
temperatures
to
well
below
degrees
celsius
above
times
and
ideally
to
degrees
the
world
has
already
warmed
by
about
degree
