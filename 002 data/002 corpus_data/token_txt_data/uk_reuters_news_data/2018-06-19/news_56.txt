in
an

trump
threatened
to
impose
a

tariff
on

of
chinese
goods
prompting
a
swift
warning
from
beijing
of
retaliation
as
the
trade
conflict
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
quickly
escalated
it
was
retaliation
trump
said
for
china
s
decision
to
raise
tariffs
on
billion
in
goods
which
came
after
trump
announced
similar
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
on
friday
china
warned
it
will
take
qualitative
and
quantitative
measures
if
the
government
publishes
an
additional
list
of
tariffs
on
its
products
the
trade
frictions
have
unnerved
financial
markets
with
investors
and
businesses
increasingly
worried
that
a
trade
battle
could
derail
global
growth
trump
appears
to
be
employing
a
similar
tactic
he
used
with
north
korea
by
blustering
first
in
order
to
gain
an
advantage
in
negotiations
the
problem
is
such
a
tactic
is
unlikely
to
work
with
china
said
kota
hirayama
senior
emerging

economist
at
smbc
nikko
securities
in
tokyo
a
trade
spat
alone
won
t
hurt
global
growth
but
there
is
always
potential
for
trump
to
keep
increasing
his
threats
which
could
have
broader
implications
increasing
trade
has
helped
growth
in
emerging
markets
and
this
could
be
negatively

fell
percent
to
its
lowest
since

february
with
losses
intensifying
through
the

the

composite

slumped
nearly
percent
at
one
point
to
its
lowest

since
while

china
s
economy
has
already
been
clouded
by
a
sharp
slowdown
in
fixed
asset
investment
growth
due
to
the
government
s
deleveraging
drive
a
problematic
property
sector
a
mounting
debt
burden
and
rising
credit
defaults
economists
at

wrote
the

while
australian
stocks
bucked
the

and

helped
by
a
depreciating

and
an
overnight
bounce
in
commodity
prices
the

fell
percent
to
yen
following
trump
s
tariff
comments
the
yen
is
often
sought
in
times
of

turmoil
and
political
tensions
the
