after
german
authorities
arrested

audi

stadler

into
turmoil
almost
three
years
after
it
admitted
to
using
illegal
software
to
cheat
emissions
tests
on
diesel
engines
analysts
said
the
arrest
raised
questions
about
whether
europe
s
biggest
carmaker
had
done
enough
to
reform
in
the
wake
of
the
crisis
and
that
it
threatened
a
delicate
truce
among
the
group
s
powerful
stakeholders
who
had
previously
clashed
about
whether
stadler
should
remain
in
power
schot
joined
the
vw

in
after
having
worked
as
president
and
ceo
of

and
marketing
since
last
september
munich
prosecutors
arrested
stadler
at
his
home
in
ingolstadt
in
the
early
hours
of
monday
saying
they
saw
a
risk
he
could
try
to
suppress
evidence
prosecutors
tapped
his
phone
a
person
familiar
with
the
investigation
told
reuters
he
remains
remanded
in
custody
in
augsburg
but
has
not
been
charged
with
a
crime
vw
and
audi
said
on
monday
that
stadler
was
presumed
innocent
unless
proven
otherwise
last
week
munich
prosecutors
said
they
were
investigating
stadler
for
suspected
fraud
and
false
advertising
and
for
his
alleged
role
in
helping
to
bring
cars
equipped
with
illegal
software
on
to
the
european
market
vw
has
set
aside
around
billion
billion
to
cover
the
cost
of
fines
vehicle
refits
and
lawsuits
arising
from
its
dieselgate
scandal
and
is
spending
billions
more
on
electric
vehicles
to
try
to
rebuild
its
reputation
vw
has
for
years
said
only
managers
knew
of
the
emissions
cheating
however
authorities
filed
criminal
charges
against
former
vw
boss
martin
winterkorn
earlier
this
year
and
german
prosecutors
continue
to
investigate
the
technique
of
using
software
to
detect
a
pollution
test
procedure
and
to
increase
the
effectiveness
of
emissions
filters
to
mask
pollution
levels
during
tests
was
first
developed
at
audi
in
designing
the
defeat
device
vw
engineers
borrowed
the
original
concept
of
the
emissions
software
from
audi
vw
said
in
its
plea
agreement
with
authorities
in
january
in
which
the
company
agreed
to
pay
a
billion
fine
to
reach
a
settlement
with
regulators
stadler
has
been
under
fire
from
the
media
politicians
and
vw
s
powerful
trade
unions
for
his
handling
of
the
scandal
but
he
survived
a
management
reshuffle
announced
in
august
thanks
to
backing
from
the
piech
and
porsche
families
that
control
vw
peter
mosch
deputy
chairman
on
audi
s
supervisory
board
and
head
of
its
works
council
said
labour
representatives
had
backed
a
move
to
appoint
schot
as
interim
ceo
to
ensure
that
audi
s
business
did
not
suffer
from
the
leadership
crisis
for
the
employees
it
is
now
important
that
the
interim
ceo
returns
the
company
to
calmer
waters
drives
the
diesel
investigation
and
brings
it
to
a
conclusion
but
mostly
keeps
the
business
in
view
