eu looks into extending import controls on chinese solar panels
brussels
reuters
the
european
commission
is
examining
whether
to
extend
measures
to
control
imports
of
solar
panels
from
china
a
move
that
could
fuel
tensions
with
beijing
which
had
welcomed
plans
to
phase
them
out
in
september
the
commission
is
studying
a
request
from
at
least
one
eu
solar
panel
producer
to
open
an
expiry
review
according
to
eu
sources
familiar
with
the
procedure
controls
would
remain
in
place
for
the
duration
of
a
review
about
a
year
and
for
longer
if
the
commission
found
reason
to
prolong
them
the
commission
should
decide
whether
to
conduct
a
review
in
august
the
european
union
extended
and
measures
for
chinese
solar
panels
wafers
and
cells
by
months
in
march
signaling
that
they
should
then
end
chinese
solar
panel
makers
are
allowed
to
sell
their
products
in
europe
free
of
duties
if
they
do
so
at
a
minimum
price
that
has
progressively
declined
if
sold
for
less
they
are
subject
to
a
duty
of
up
to
percent
the
european
union
has
faced
a
delicate
balancing
act
between
the
interests
of
eu
manufacturers
and
those
pressing
for
a
reduction
in
the
cost
of
solar
power
generation
it
has
also
been
concerned
about
the
response
from
beijing
given
the
two
sides
were
on
the
verge
of
a
trade
war
over
the
issue
in
eu
prosun
the
grouping
of
eu
producers
that
launched
the
initial
complaint
in
said
there
were
good
reasons
for
measures
to
be
prolonged
the
minimum
price
was
approaching
the
international
market
price
as
designed
but
the
latter
was
a
reflection
of
chinese
overcapacity
rather
than
the
cost
of
production
it
said
beijing
s
own
decision
to
limit
installations
meant
chinese
producers
had
some
gigawatts
of
excess
capacity
to
shift
with
few
markets
to
sell
into
after
tariffs
imposed
by
the
united
states
and
considered
by
india
the
second
and
third
largest
markets
behind
china
the
total
eu
market
is
some
gigawatts
solarpower
europe
which
represents
those
in
the
solar
industry
opposed
to
duties
said
it
did
not
see
how
a
would
really
harm
eu
producers
given
the
two
largest
were
either
closed
or
in
liquidation
despite
the
measures
the
two
sides
dispute
whether
lower
costs
will
spur
installations
solarpower
europe
referred
to
commission
and
ey
studies
indicating
demand
could
increase
by
up
to
percent
creating
about
jobs
if
the
measures
were
removed
eu
prosun
says
lower
prices
over
the
last
five
years
have
not
boosted
demand
which
it
says
is
determined
by
installation
caps
and
rules
set
by
individual
countries
