trump

last

tensions
between
the

s
top
two
economies
have
unnerved
farmers
and
slammed
agricultural
markets
on
worries
that

the

pork
and

would
slow

halt

of

have
lost
an

in

with
the
swift
escalation
in
the
trade
spat
over
the
past
two
weeks
the
most
rapid
erosion
of
farm
profit
since
at
least
according
to
dan
basse
president
of
consultancy
agresource
net
farm
income
was
already
projected
to
fall
percent
to
billion
in
a
low
according
to
the
agriculture
department
when
you
get
in
a
fight
with
your
biggest
buyer
of
agriculture
and
the
world
s
largest
soybean
buyer
even
if
they
were
to
buy
percent
less
it
s
a
big
deal
basse
said
concerns
about
tariffs
are
already
disrupting
global
trade
china
which
imports
about
of
all
soybeans
traded
globally
has
not
bought
significant
amounts
of
soybeans
in
three
weeks
traders
fear
that
china
will
begin
canceling
the
more
than
million
tonnes
of
soybeans
that
it
has
purchased
but
have
yet
to
ship
valued
at
more
than
billion
the
country
has
also
not
bought
significant
ethanol
volumes
for
about
six
months
despite
increased
targets
for
its
use
there
amid
the
threat
of
tariffs
on
the
biofuel
the
ethanol
industry
has
become
more
dependent
on
exports
due
to
big
domestic
stockpiles
china
has
to
be
buying
it
from
somewhere
said
a
ethanol
trader
who
asked
not
to
be
named
because
he
was
not
authorized
to

to
the

it
isn

the

fight
with
china
comes
amid
elevated

tensions
with
several
other
top

product
importers
including
mexico

on
