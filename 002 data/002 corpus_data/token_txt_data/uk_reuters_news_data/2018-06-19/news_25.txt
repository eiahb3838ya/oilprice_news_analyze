forking out: egyptians angered by new austerity after eid feast
cairo
reuters
many
egyptians
hoped
to
ignore
their
economic
hardship
as
they
celebrated
the
end
of
the
muslim
fasting
month
of
ramadan
instead
they
were
told
they
will
have
to
tighten
their
belts
even
more
with
the
eid
feast
in
full
swing
the
government
of
president
abdel
fattah
on
saturday
declared
it
was
slashing
fuel
subsidies
pushing
up
prices
of
petrol
and
public
transport
by
as
much
as
percent
people
returning
to
work
in
cairo
on
tuesday
seethed
at
the
new
sums
they
had
to
pay
to
board
buses
or
fill
up
their
vehicles
with
petrol
we
knew
there
were
going
to
be
price
rises
but
didn
t
expect
it
to
be
this
big
said
sabah
hassan
a
mother
of
six
who
works
as
a
cleaner
at
a
nursery
hassan
said
her
transportation
costs
have
jumped
from
around
pounds
per
trip
to
at
least
my
household
gas
has
doubled
and
so
has
my
water
bill
how
will
my
wages
cover
it
all
the
fuel
price
increase
was
the
latest
in
a
raft
of
austerity
measures
egypt
is
carrying
out
as
part
of
major
economic
reforms
the
price
of
a
billion
loan
from
the
international
monetary
fund
the
country
s
economy
which
was
battered
by
the
unrest
that
followed
a
popular
uprising
has
begun
to
improve
since
sisi
came
to
power
in
authorities
and
many
economists
credit
the
reforms
with
helping
to
attract
foreign
investment
and
accelerate
growth
in
gross
domestic
product
but
fiscal
reforms
have
hit
ordinary
egyptians
hard
the
fuel
subsidy
cuts
came
just
days
after
the
government
said
prices
for
electricity
would
rise
by
an
average
of
percent
and
for
piped
drinking
water
by
nearly
half
sisi
who
was
against
virtually
no
competition
in
a
landslide
april
vote
has
urged
patience
from
the
egyptian
people
saying
recently
the
country
could
only
reap
the
benefits
of
austerity
with
everyone
on
board
i
don
t
like
to
talk
about
other
countries
but
i
hope
we
take
note
he
said
earlier
this
month
in
an
apparent
reference
to
protests
over
tax
rises
in
jordan
warning
that
similar
unrest
in
egypt
threatened
stability
the
government
has
said
it
will
increase
welfare
spending
to
help
out
poor
egyptians
some
egyptians
said
they
would
willingly
foot
the
bill
for
stability
and
an
improved
economy
aside
from
economic
problems
egypt
faces
an
islamist
militancy
in
its
sinai
peninsula
it
ll
cost
me
more
to
fuel
my
motorbike
but
this
is
a
small
price
to
pay
to
support
sisi
and
put
egypt
back
on
track
said
ahmed
mohamed
a
cafe
worker
mohamed
said
he
was
glad
to
see
the
back
of
the
uprising
that
had
toppled
longtime
leader
hosni
mubarak
and
then
the
muslim
brotherhood
other
egyptians
did
not
share
his
views
sisi
should
think
of
ordinary
people
for
once
said
nermin
a
textile
industry
manager
declining
to
give
her
full
name
all
we
do
is
spend
and
see
nothing
in
a
taxi
driver
who
gave
his
name
as
mohamed
mubarak
said
it
was
becoming
more
and
more
expensive
to
run
his
car
in
mubarak
s
days
i
would
go
to
the
petrol
station
with
pounds
fill
her
up
and
have
money
left
now
it
s
pounds
all
for
the
sake
of
tahiya
masr
long
live
egypt
he
said
mocking
a
sisi
slogan
despite
discontent
most
egyptians
said
they
had
no
plans
to
protest
out
of
fear
of
chaos
that
might
follow
or
of
arrest
rare
protests
broke
out
last
month
over
a
sudden
increase
in
fares
on
cairo
s
metro
system
several
people
were
arrested
in
connection
with
the
demonstrations
which
were
made
illegal
in
without
permission
from
the
interior
ministry
no
one
will
raise
their
voice
people
are
scared
and
feel
shackled
mubarak
said
he
charged
pounds
for
a
normally
fare
