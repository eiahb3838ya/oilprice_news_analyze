raise
prices
for
british
customers
taking
both
gas
and

by
percent
from
the
german
utility
said
on
tuesday
the
last
of
the
big
six
energy
suppliers
to
increase
its
tariffs
the
move
follows
similar
increases
announced
this
year
by
the
other
five
big
suppliers
in
the
country
and
comes

regulator
ofgem
is
working
to
set
a
cap
on
standard
prices
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
british
government
has
asked
ofgem
to
put
the
price
cap
on
to
combat
what
it
has
called
rip
off
energy
prices
utilities
have
denied
overcharging
but
the
competition
and
markets
authority
found
they
had
overcharged
some
british
households
a
total
of
billion
pounds
a
year
on
average
from
to
prompting
the
government
to
act
said
the
increase
was
needed
due
to
the
significant
rise
in
the
cost
of
wholesale
energy
and
in
common
with
similar
pressures
faced
by
a
number
of
other
suppliers
of
all
sizes
across
the
industry
over
recent
it
said
wholesale
energy
costs
have
increased
more
than
percent
since
march
largely
due
to
the
impact
of
extremely
cold
temperatures
earlier
this
year
depleting
european
gas
storage
said
the
latest
rise
equated
to
an
average
extra
cost
of
pounds
per
year
per
customer
and
it
had
not
increased
its
standard
gas
and
electricity
unit
prices
since
april
however
earlier
this
year
it
changed
the
way
it
structured
bills
including
scrapping
discounts
for
people
who
take
both
gas
and
electricity
from
the
company
and
for
those
who
opt
for
paperless
billing
which
added
around
pounds
per
year
to
average
bills
