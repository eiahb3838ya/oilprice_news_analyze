a
power
cable
connecting
wind
farms
in
the
north
sea
to
britain
and
the
netherlands
could
be
in
place
after
if
the
plan
secures
approval
a
partner
in
the
project
said
swedish
utility
vattenfall
and
grid
operator
tennet
agreed
last
week
to
conduct
a
feasibility
study
on
the
link
called
windconnector
which
vattenfall
says
could
lower
the
costs
of
connecting
offshore
wind
farms
to
the
shore
gunnar
groebler
vattenfall
s
senior
vice
president
for
wind
business
told
reuters
the
study
would
be
completed
by
the
end
of
or
early
and
the
link
could
be
in
place
after
he
said
the
cable
would
help
reduce
the
costs
of
wind
power
which
now
has
to
compete
with
smaller
subsidies
he
said
the
project
makes
the
whole
business
case
much
more
the
new
link
could
offer
britain
an
additional
source
of
renewable
energy
as
it
works
to
phase
out
coal
power
by
tennet
and
vattenfall
will
need
to
address
regulatory
issues
such
as
how
wind
farms
linked
to
the
cable
will
be
treated
under
subsidy
schemes
in
their
respective
countries
obviously
we
have
a
tonne
of
regulatory
questions
on
that
when
a
wind
farm
feeds
to
one
country
and
another
country
how
is
that
treated
from
support
scheme
perspective
renewable
balance
said
groebler
vattenfall
has
estimated
that
the
cable
would
likely
have
to
megawatts
mw
capacity
but
the
partners
have
yet
to
confirm
the
final
cable
capacity
and
which
wind
farms
it
would
link
to
the
cost
also
has
to
be
determined
groebler
said
vattenfall
wants
to
be
involved
in
new
wind
farm
projects
in
britain
and
the
netherlands
as
well
as
germany
denmark
france
and
the
nordic
nations
chief
executive
magnus
hall
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
the
firm
s
capital
markets
day
vattenfall
already
runs
wind
farms
with
total
generation
capacity
of
gigawatt
gw
in
britain
the
netherlands
denmark
sweden
and
germany
with
a
further
gw
under
construction
