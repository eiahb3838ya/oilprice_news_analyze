world
stocks
steadied
on
wednesday
and
wall
street
was
set
to
open
firmer
after
the
previous
session
saw
trillion
wiped
off
the
value
of
leading
tech
shares
while
oil
prices
staged
a
modest
rebound
after
slumping
to
lows
equity
futures
for
all

indexes
were
up
to
percent
after
two
days
of
losses
that
wiped
out
the
s
s
gains
for
the
year
and
left
the
nasdaq
benchmark
teetering
on
the
brink
of
falling
into
the
red
tuesday
s
losses
were
led
by
the
technology
sector
as
investors
lightened
holdings
of
faang
shares
facebook
apple
amazon
netflix
and
google
the
group
that
had
propelled
the
wall
street
s
bull
market
but
sentiment
appeared
to
recover
slightly
as
brent

rebounded
almost
percent
after
a
six

slide
msci

closed
flat
and
the

benchmark
attempted
to
snap
two

of

rose

in

european
equities
rose

both
up
around

the

david
vickers
senior
portfolio
manager
at
russell
investments
noted
however
that
gloom
has
tended
to
deepen
in
volatile
markets
as
the
wall
street
session
progresses
and
more
company
earnings
emerge
momentum
stocks
have
come
off
in
a
fairly
spectacular
fashion
at
one
point
apple
and
amazon
accounted
for
percent
of
equity
gains
and
people
were
just
recycling
money
into
the
winners
vickers
said
that
s
come
off
the
boil
and
set
the
cat
among
the
pigeons
we
ve
seen
a
lot
of
reflexivity
when
selling
begets
selling
the
market
starts
to
turn
over
people
take
profits
it
leads
to
another
leg
down
and
so
markets
also
appear
to
be
preparing
for
a
loss
of
momentum
in
global
economic
growth
as
china
takes
a
hit
from
washington
s
trade
tariffs
and
the
united
states
comes
off
the
of
president
donald
trump
s
tax
cuts
vickers
said
that
after
earnings
growth
at
companies
some
investors
were
disappointed
with
signs
this
would
slow
to
single
digits
as
the
stimulus
effect
wore
off
if
you
have
a
market
like
the
s
which
is
two
standard
deviations
expensive
it
becomes
difficult
if
you
don
t
think
you
will
get
the
same
kinds
of
earnings
growth
in
future
he
added
growth
worries
have
also
been
revived
by
comments
from
federal
reserve
officials
who
suggested
economic
outlook
concerns
could
slow
the
pace
of
its
monetary
policy
tightening
cycle
or
even
end
it
the
comments
knocked
bond
yields
to
near
lows
around
percent
down
from
percent
in
november
but
yields
rose
around
bps
on
wednesday
to
around
percent
jonas
david
a
strategist
at
ubs
global
wealth
management
said
a
meeting
between
trump
and
chinese
president
xi
jinping
at
the
end
of
the
month
could
determine
the
course
of
bond
markets
and
rates
if
we
don
t
get
a
relaxation
of
trade
tensions
after
the
markets
may
start
questioning
the
prospect
of
another
fed
rate
hike
in
december
he
said
the
euro
rose
percent
after
a
percent
drop
on
tuesday
buoyed
by
promises
of
reform
from
italy
s
prime
minister
and
hopes
that
rome
and
the
european
commission
would
reach
a
compromise
in
a
dispute
over
the
deficit
in
the
draft
italian
budget
italy
s
bond
yield
fell
bps
at
percent
while
yields
tumbled
as
much
as
nine
bps
to
percent
and
were
set
for
their
biggest
daily
drop
in
over
three
weeks
the
european
commission
has
rejected
the
draft
plan
but
ubs
wealth
s
david
said
markets
were
right
to
be
optimistic
about
the
eventual
outcome
of
the
row
between
brussels
and
rome
we
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
these
dynamics
but
factors
related
to
economic
momentum
in
the
euro
zone
and
the
fed
interest
rate
outlook
are
far
more
important
for
the
euro
