japan threatens to cut solar power subsidies, angering investors
tokyo
reuters
the
japanese
government
is
threatening
to
cut
existing
solar
power
project
subsidies
angering
the
power
producers
and
investors
that
say
the
cuts
will
undermine
their
profitability
and
violate
earlier
agreements
the
ministry
of
economy
trade
and
industry
meti
last
month
proposed
that
companies
granted
permits
for
solar
projects
between
the
fiscal
years
of
to
under
that
guarantee
minimum
power
prices
submit
applications
by
march
to
connect
to
the
grid
companies
that
miss
the
deadline
will
see
their
price
guarantees
under
the
tariffs
of
to
yen
to
per
kilowatt
hour
kwh
cut
to
yen
per
kwh
public
comments
for
the
proposal
are
due
by
wednesday
japan
introduced
the
fit
to
spur
solar
developments
to
fill
the
power
gap
after
the
country
closed
its
nuclear
power
plants
following
the
fukushima
disaster
japan
s
fit
levels
are
among
the
highest
in
the
world
compared
to
per
kwh
in
germany
and
at
least
as
much
as
those
in
spain
meti
has
said
the
cuts
are
necessary
to
reduce
the
public
burden
of
the
fit
subsidies
which
are
added
to
consumers
bills
at
the
same
time
meti
is
likely
unhappy
with
the
amount
of
unfilled
permits
data
from
the
ministry
shows
percent
of
the
total
capacity
approved
in
fiscal
year
is
not
operating
with
percent
approved
in
and
percent
approved
in
also
not
operating
investors
and
operators
in
solar
projects
are
angry
with
the
proposals
threatening
lawsuits
against
the
government
for
breaching
the
earlier
contracts
a
similar
decision
by
spain
in
led
to
compensation
payments
to
investors
litigation
will
inevitably
ensue
from
japan
and
abroad
and
it
will
be
difficult
to
convince
the
public
that
there
is
no
risk
of
the
government
losing
when
the
proposed
changes
so
blatantly
disregard
the
foundations
of
the
fit
scheme
according
to
a
note
to
clients
from
law
firm
orrick
reviewed
by
reuters
orrick
confirmed
the
authenticity
of
the
document
meti
estimates
show
the
subsidy
cut
could
affect
gigawatts
gw
of
solar
capacity
or
nearly
percent
of
the
amount
the
government
approved
in
the
period
after
the
fit
scheme
was
created
in
japan
s
total
installed
power
capacity
is
around
gw
with
gw
coming
from
solar
the
suddenness
of
the
proposal
its
almost
immediate
implementation
and
ambiguity
around
implementation
could
put
future
and
existing
investments
at
risk
said
a
group
of
business
lobbying
groups
in
japan
from
the
united
states
europe
australia
new
zealand
and
canada
in
a
statement
on
friday
the
changes
could
also
undermine
market
participants
confidence
in
the
security
stability
and
predictability
of
japanese
market
rules
the
groups
said
beyond
japanese
investors
blackrock
and
goldman
sachs
group
s
japan
renewable
energy
are
among
the
biggest
investors
in
the
solar
sector
in
japan
blackrock
declined
to
comment
and

could
not

an
official
who
declined
to
be
identified
from
a
japanese
renewable
power
producer
that
submitted
comments
to
meti
said
that
some
operators
with
bad
intent
have
deliberately
delayed
projects
however
she
argued
that
solar
projects
do
take
a
significant
amount
of
time
to
push
forward
because
of
environmental
mitigation
measures
and
discussions
with
nearby
landowners
the
company
told
meti
a
unilateral
schedule
for
automatic
cuts
is
hard
to
deal
with
several
investors
and
lawyers
involved
said
the
changes
will
likely
see
many
projects
canceled
banks
that
have
built
up
project
finance
teams
to
handle
the
billions
of
dollars
of
investment
that
has
flowed
into
renewables
in
japan
have
stopped
or
cut
funding
for
projects
one
investor
said
the
investor
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
issue
the
japanese
bankers
association
requested
that
projects
which
already
have
signed
loan
contracts
be
exempted
from
the
new
rule
saying
that
a
significant
reduction
in
fit
price
would
threaten
default
on
payments
