over
the
thanksgiving
holiday
weekend
when

in

power
and
gas
prices
can
spike
quickly
because
most
consumers

their
homes

of
the

plants
the
region
lacks
sufficient
gas
pipeline
capacity
to
supply
fuel
for
both
heat
and
power
generation
on
the

days

many
plants
have
to
burn

the

tried
to
build

pipes
across

from

years
but
some

in

have
blocked
those
efforts
preferring
to
invest
more
in
energy
efficiency
and
renewable
sources
of
power
gas
utilities
have
said
more
pipelines
are
needed
because
consumers
are
switching
from
oil
to
gas
to
heat
homes
since
it
is
cheaper
and
cleaner
and
the
region
is
becoming
increasingly
dependent
