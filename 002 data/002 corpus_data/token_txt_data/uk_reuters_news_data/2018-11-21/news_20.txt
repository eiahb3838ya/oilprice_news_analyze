goldman sachs expects volatile oil prices in coming weeks
reuters
goldman
sachs
said
in
a
note
on
wednesday
that
it
expects
oil
markets
to
remain
highly
volatile
in
the
coming
weeks
oil
markets
clawed
back
some
ground
on
wednesday
after
tumbling
more
than
percent
the
day
previous
day
in
heavy
trading
volumes
it
will
take
a
fundamental
catalyst
for
prices
to
stabilise
and
eventually
trade
higher
goldman
said
in
the
note
adding
that
such
a
catalyst
would
include
physical
evidence
that
opec
production
is
sequentially
declining
and
further
proof
of
demand
resilience
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
is
pushing
allied
producers
including
russia
to
join
in
output
cuts
of
million
to
million
barrels
per
day
goldman
said
the
renewed
price
collapse
reflected
concerns
over
excess
supply
in
and
a
broader
and
as
growth
concerns
continue
to
the
investment
bank
said
a
sharp
collapse
in
demand
or
the
absence
of
an
opec
production
cut
would
be
the
two
main
risk
to
a
recovery
in
prices
from
current
levels
while
both
are
unlikely
we
are
more
concerned
about
the
latter
with
such
a
shift
leading
to
sustainably
lower
prices
