world
stocks
attempted
to
steady
on
wednesday
following
a
bruising
wall
street
session
that
wiped
trillion
off
the
value
of
leading
tech
shares
while
oil
prices
staged
a
modest
rebound
after
slumping
to
lows
shares
were
set
to
open
sharply
firmer
futures
indicated
after
two
days
of
losses
that
wiped
out
the
s
s
gains
for
the
year
and
left
the
nasdaq
index
teetering
on
the
brink
of
falling
into
the
red
losses
have
been
concentrated
in
the
technology
sector
as
investors
lightened
holdings
of
faang
shares
facebook
apple
amazon
netflix
and
google
the
group
that
had
propelled
the
wall
street
s
bull
market
the
falls
saw
the
nasdaq
index
touch
lows
and
energy
shares
too
had
dropped
in

with
a
percent
oil
price
slump
s
p
that
fed
through
to
asia
on
wednesday
taking
msci
s
index
of
shares
almost
half
a
percent
lower
but
it
clawed
back
some
of
those
falls
to
trade
flat
by
gmt
msci
s
benchmark
was
flat
too
attempting
to
snap
two
days
of
falls
that
alongside
a
percent
bounce
in
brent
crude
futures
and
some
optimism
over
italy
s
budget
stance
helped
european
equities
open
percent
higher
with
a
tech
index
up
half
a
percent
david
vickers
senior
portfolio
manager
at
russell
investments
noted
however
that
gloom
has
tended
to
deepen
as
the
wall
street
session
progresses
and
more
company
earnings
emerge
momentum
stocks
have
come
off
in
a
fairly
spectacular
fashion
at
one
point
apple
and
amazon
accounted
for
percent
of
equity
gains
and
people
were
just
recycling
money
into
the
winners
vickers
said
that
s
come
off
the
boil
and
set
the
cat
among
the
pigeons
we
ve
seen
a
lot
of
reflexivity
when
selling
begets
selling
the
market
starts
to
turn
over
people
take
profits
it
leads
to
another
leg
down
and
so
markets
also
appear
to
be
preparing
for
a
loss
of
momentum
in
global
economic
growth
as
china
takes
a
hit
from
washington
s
trade
tariffs
and
the
united
states
comes
off
the
of
president
donald
trump
s
tax
cuts
vickers
said
that
after
earnings
growth
at
companies
some
investors
were
disappointed
with
signs
this
would
slow
to
single
digits
as
the
stimulus
effect
wore
off
if
you
have
a
market
like
the
s
which
is
two
standard
deviations
expensive
it
becomes
difficult
if
you
don
t
think
you
will
get
the
same
kinds
of
earnings
growth
in
future
he
added
the
growth
concerns
have
also
been
revived
by
comments
from
federal
reserve
officials
who
suggested
economic
outlook
concerns
could
slow
the
pace
of
its
monetary
policy
tightening
cycle
or
even
end
it
the
comments
have
knocked
bond
yields
to
near
lows
around
percent
after
trading
above
percent
at
the
start
of
november
but
the
recovery
in
global
sentiment
allowed
yields
to
rise
around
three
bps
to
percent
while
the
dollar
s
index
which
had
jumped
percent
on
tuesday
slipped
percent
the
euro
rose
after
a
percent
drop
on
tuesday
buoyed
by
reports
that
italy
may
be
open
to
reviewing
its
draft
budget
for
possibly
easing
a
confrontation
with
the
european
union
the
league
party
part
of
the
ruling
coalition
later
denied
the
report
italians
bond
yields
fell
up
to
basis
points
initially
putting
yields
on
track
for
their
biggest
daily
drop
in
almost
a
month
but
the
market
gave
up
some
of
its
gains
after
the
denials
italian
bank
shares
too
eased
off
session
highs
but
were
still
up
percent
on
the
day
after
sinking
to
lows
on
tuesday
focus
is
now
on
the
european
commission
which
should
take
the
first
step
on
wednesday
towards
disciplining
italy
over
its
draft
fiscal
plan
this
procedure
will
take
several
months
but
stands
to
keep
government
bonds
and
the
italian
banking
sector
under
pressure
favour
euro
underperformance
in
europe
and
probably
further
choppy
trading
in
a
range
ing
bank
analysts
told
clients
oil
s
bounce
helped
commodity
currencies
such
as
the
australian
dollar
and
norwegian
crown
which
recovered
around
percent
versus
the
dollar
after
heavy
recent
slides
