corrected-update 2-google invests $700 mln in danish data centre, secures green energy
copenhagen
reuters
google
will
invest
almost
million
million
pounds
in
a
danish
data
centre
powered
by
the
abundant
green
energy
that
underpins
intensive
companies
interest
in
the
nordic
region
google
also
said
it
would
sign
a
power
purchase
agreement
ppa
for
the
new
danish
data
centre
to
ensure
it
is
powered
by
renewable
energy
the
nordic
countries
which
can
generate
electricity
relatively
cheaply
from
renewable
sources
such
as
hydropower
and
wind
have
long
been
a
magnet
for
heavy
industries
but
are
now
attracting
data
centres
annual
investment
in
nordic
data
centres
could
double
to
more
than
billion
euros
billion
pounds
by
a
new
study
published
by
the
nordic
council
of
ministers
the
official
body
for
regional
cooperation
said
on
tuesday
big
companies
have
rushed
to
secure
cheap
renewable
energy
to
manage
costs
and
reduce
their
carbon
footprint
through
corporate
ppas
which
allow
firms
such
as
google
owned
by
alphabet
inc
facebook
and
microsoft
to
buy
directly
from
energy
generators
nordic
countries
are
competing
for
the
investments
with
the
more
established
markets
an
acronym
for
while
the
nordics
are
still
perceived
as
less
connected
than
these
markets
the
region
is
likely
to
gain
market
share
the
council
of
ministers
study
said
this
is
partly
due
to
the
region
s
plentiful
renewable
energy
and
political
stability
while
the
planned
installation
of
major
fibre
optic
links
to
north
america
and
asia
will
improve
connectivity
google
said
it
is
also
evaluating
investments
in
a
number
of
onshore
and
offshore
wind
and
solar
energy
projects
in
denmark
in
september
google
signed
a
deal
to
buy
renewable
energy
from
three
new
wind
farms
being
built
in
finland
that
will
power
one
of
its
data
centres
last
year
the
number
of
new
corporate
ppas
primarily
wind
and
solar
reached
a
record
with
more
than
gigawatt
contracted
up
almost
a
third
from
the
level
according
to
the
international
renewable
energy
agency
the
new
data
centre
in
the
small
city
of
fredericia
will
cost
billion
danish
crowns
million
pounds
and
employ
to
staff
once
completed
in
according
to
the
plans
besides
fredericia
google
bought
another
plot
last
year
in
aabenraa
denmark
next
to
a
planned
apple
inc
data
centre
facebook
has
also
planned
a
data
centre
in
denmark
denmark
is
home
to
a
large
wind
energy
sector
including
turbine
