of
however
iran
s
clerical
rulers
have
dismissed
concerns
about
the
impact
of
sanctions
on
the
country
s
economy
this
is
an
economic
war
against
iran
but
america
should
learn
that
it
can
not
use
the
language
of
force
against
iran
we
are
prepared
to
resist
any
pressure

keep
the
deal
alive
the

parties
to
the

despite
scepticism
this
is
possible
despite

choke
off

until
early
next
year
they
cautioned
however
that
no
country
had
volunteered
to
host
the
entity
which
was
delaying
the
process
we
are
in
regular
contact
with
other
signatories
of
the
nuclear
deal
setting
up
a
mechanism
to
continue
trade
with
the

will
take
time
