asian
stocks
were
hammered
on
monday
as
fears
of
faster
rate
hikes
in
the
united
states
and
uncertainty
around
the
trade
war
dented
risk
sentiment
while
sterling
jumped

an
orderly

msci

chinese
shares
opened
in

with
stocks
off
percent
even
as
president
xi
jinping
promised
to
lower
import
tariffs
and
continue
to
broaden
market
access
xi
however
acknowledged
conditions
abroad
had
created
some
challenges
for
the
chinese
economy
stock
futures
were
down
percent
after
wall
street
closed
in
the
red
on
friday
on
a
combination
of
upbeat
jobs
growth
for
october
and
concerns
a
trade
deal
between
the
united
states
and
china
may
not
be
struck
soon
we
expect
trade
tensions
to
get
worse
before
they
get
better
citi
analysts
said
in
a
note
although
trade
growth
has
held
steady

are
rising

added
equity
markets
do
not
seem
to
be
fully
incorporating
the
risks
of
an
escalation
of
tensions
yet
which
could
have
an
effect
on
investment
sentiment
inflation
and
sentiment
is
also
broadly
expected
to
be
nervous
ahead
of
congressional
midterm
elections
on
tuesday
opinion
polls
show
a
strong
chance
that
the
democratic
party
could
win
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
after
two
years
of
wielding
no
practical
political
power
in
washington
with
president
donald
trump
s
republican
party
likely
to
hold
the
senate
also
clouding
the
outlook
for
world
shares
is
the
prospect
of
tighter
monetary
policy
in
the
united
states
given
robust
economic
data
in
recent
months
the
united
states
reported
solid
jobs
growth
for
october
with
annual
wage
gains
at
highs
further
boosting
expectations
for
a
december
rate
rise
the
employment
report
supports
our
view
that
the
federal
reserve
will
raise
rates
three
more
times
from
now
until
capital
economics
said
in
a
note
after
that
we
suspect
that
the
cumulative
effect
of
monetary
policy
tightening
will
start
taking
a
toll
on
the
us
economy
forcing
the
fed
to
end
its
tightening
cycle
and
pulling
treasury
yields
the
us
stock
market
and
the
dollar
sterling
jumped
to
a
high
on
monday
on
growing
hopes
of
a
smooth
brexit
while
asian
stocks
started
the
week
gingerly
amid
worries
over
tense
trade
relations
with
just
five
months
to
go
until
britain
exits
the
european
union
divorce
talks
are
at
an
impasse
fuelling
severe
uncertainty
among
businesses
and
whipsawing
sterling
on
any
news
of
a
possible
breakthrough
in
the
negotiations
a
sunday
times
report
that
an
customs
deal
will
be
written
into
the
agreement
governing
britain
s
withdrawal
from
the
eu
was
enough
to
cheer
investors
who
sent
the
pound
to
the
highest
since
the
currency
has
faltered
in
seven
of
the
months
of
this
year
so
far
losing
as
much
as
percent
it
was
last
up
percent
at
the
prime
minister

office
said
the
sunday
times
report
was
speculative
but
added
that

of
the
withdrawal
agreement
was
settled
and
negotiations
were
ongoing
the

struggled
to
hold
gains
made
on
friday
following
