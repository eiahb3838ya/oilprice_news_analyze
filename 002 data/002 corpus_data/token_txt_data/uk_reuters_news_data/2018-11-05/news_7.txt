chicago
reuters
north
american
farmers
are
finding
increased
levels
of
a
plant
toxin
known
as
vomitoxin
in
this
year
s
corn
harvest
adding
insult
to
injury
for
growers
already
suffering
as
the
trade
war
hurts
soybean
exports
and
crop
prices
vomitoxin
sickens
livestock
and
can
also
make
humans
and
pets
fall
ill
and
grain
buyers
can
reject
cargoes
or
fine
farmers
for
shipments
that
contain
it
more
cases
than
normal
are
likely
in
the
corn
crop
because
wet
weather
this
autumn
caused
the
fungus
to
develop
while
delaying
harvests

about
of
corn

used
domestically
to
feed
livestock
and
make
ethanol
and
a
byproduct
called
distillers
dried
grains
that
is
fed
to
animals
however
livestock
and
ethanol
producers
need
to
blend
corn
that
contains
vomitoxin
with
corn
that
does
not
to
make
it
suitable
for
feed
when
toxin
levels
are
high
hogs
don
t
like
the
taste
and
don
t
like
the
smell
they
will
literally
starve
to
death
before
eating
it

the
quality
worries
come
as

has
plunged
by
half
over
the
past
five
years
and
as
the
deepening
trade
war
harms
demand
for

the

has
detected
vomitoxin
in
corn
in
iowa
and
nebraska
where
it
is
not
normally
a
problem
a
source
with
knowledge
of
the
situation
said
the
company
which
feeds
corn
to
hogs
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
the
food
and
drug
administration
allows
vomitoxin
levels
of
up
to
one
part
per
million
ppm
in
human
and
pet
foods
and
recommends
levels
under
five
ppm
in
grain
for
hogs
ppm
for
chickens
and
dairy
cattle
beef
cattle
can
withstand
toxin
levels
up
to
ppm
andersons
is
warning
farmers
delivering
corn
to
an
ethanol
plant
in
albion
michigan
that
corn
with
vomitoxin
levels
above
five
ppm
is
subject
to
rejection
ethanol
plants
in
michigan
and
ohio
are
also
testing
corn
deliveries
for
the
toxin
and
charging
farmers
financial
penalties
if
their

contain
too
much

said

a

a
feed
supplement
company
alltech
had
tested
samples
of
this
year
s
corn
harvest
as
of
friday
and
found
percent
contained
vomitoxin
hawkins
said
that
is
about
average
hawkins
said
but
he
expected
further
testing
to
reveal
bigger
problems
more
samples
have
not
been
examined
yet
because
of
the
rains
that
delayed
harvesting
which
was
percent
complete
as
of
sunday
it
s
going
to
get
worse
