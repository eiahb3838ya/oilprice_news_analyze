oil
prices
dipped
on
monday
as
the
start
to
sanctions
against
iran
s
fuel
exports
was
softened
by
waivers
that
will
allow
some
countries
to
still
import
iranian
crude
at
least
temporarily
brent
crude
futures
the
international
benchmark
for

were
at

on

down
cents
or
percent

intermediate

crude
futures
were
down
cents
or
percent
at
a

brent
has
lost
more
than
percent
in
value
since
early
october
while
wti
has
declined
by
more
than
percent
since
then
traders
said
prices
have
been
coming
under
pressure
since
it
became
clear
that
washington
was
allowing
several
countries
to
continue
importing
crude
from
iran
despite
the
sanctions
which
officially
started
on
monday
the
united
states
said
on
friday
it
will
temporarily
allow
eight
importers
to
keep
buying
iranian
oil
when
it
sanctions
aimed
at
forcing
iran
to
curb
its
nuclear
missile
and
regional
activities
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
who
announced
the
decision
did
not
name
the
eight
which
he
referred
to
as
jurisdictions
a
term
that
might
include
importers
such
as
taiwan
which
the
united
states
does
not
regard
as
a
country
china
india
south
korea
turkey
italy
the
united
arab
emirates
and
japan
have
been
the
top
importers
of
iran
s
oil
while
taiwan
occasionally
buys
cargoes
of
iranian
crude
but
is
not
a
major
buyer
all
eyes
will
be
on
the
outcome
of
negotiations
on
possible
waivers
to
sanctions
on
iran
any
deals
allowing
oil
importers
to
continue
buying
from
iran
could
see
prices
come
under
further
pressure
anz
bank
said
on
monday
oil
markets
have
already
adjusted
to
the
iran
sanctions
gradually
dialling
back
imports
in
preparations
iranian
exports
and
production
had
been
declining
steadily
in
advance
market
surveys
of
iranian
exports
show
a
decline
of
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
as
of
october
from
may
edward
bell
commodity
analyst
at
emirates
nbd
bank
said
on
the
demand
side
bell
warned
that
consumption
may
be
slowing
due
to
an
economic
slowdown
as
seen
in
a
sharp
drop
in
refining
profits
for
key
fuels
like
gasoline
sagging
refining
margins
at
a
time
of
weak
crude
prices
sends
a
very
telling
message
to
us
that
demand
is
underperforming
