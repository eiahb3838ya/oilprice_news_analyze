said
he
wants
to
impose
sanctions
on

gradually
citing
concerns
about
shocking
energy
markets
and
causing
global
price
spikes
with
the
oil
it
s
very
interesting
we
have
the
toughest
sanctions
ever
imposed
but
on
oil
we
want
to
go
a
little
bit
slower
because
i
don
t
want
to
drive
up
the
oil
prices
in
the
world
he
told

before
flying
to
a
campaign
event
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
iran
i
could
get
the

down
to

but
it
would
cause
a
shock
to
the
market
i
don
t
