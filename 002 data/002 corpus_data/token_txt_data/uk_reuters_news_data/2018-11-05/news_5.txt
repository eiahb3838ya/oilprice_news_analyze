brazil
s
soy
processing
executives
are
in
talks
with
chinese
government
officials
over
ways
to
increase
soymeal
exports
to
the
asian
nation
industry
group
abiove
said
on
monday
china
already
buys
around
percent
of
brazilian
soybean
exports
according
to
official
data
brazil
exported
million
tonnes
of
soybeans
to
china
from
january
to
september
while
sales
of
soymeal
crushed
soybeans
used
for
animal
feed
were
tonnes
in
a
video
message
to
participants
at
a
biodiesel
conference
in
sao
paulo
abiove
s
head
andr√©
nassar
said
there
was
a
need
to
increase
exports
of
meal
to
help
local
crushers
that
are
facing
rising
costs
for
soybeans
nassar
is
part
of
a
brazilian
delegation
accompanying
agriculture
ministry
officials
visiting
china
this
week
to
discuss
bilateral
trade
while
brazilian
soy
farmers
have
benefited
from
a
trade
spat
between
united
states
and
china
which
applied
a
additional
tax
on
soybean
imports
brazilian
crushers
have
seen
supplies
of
soybeans
shrink
and
production
costs
rise
it
could
be
a
solution
china
could
diversify
their
imports
by
buying
more
meal
from
brazil
something
that
in
turn
would
help
our
crushers
said
nassar
in
the
message
during
the
biodieselbr
conference
brazilian
soymeal
exports
to
china
face
higher
taxes
than
soybeans
abiove
said
it
was
negotiating
with
chinese
government
officials
for
a
quota
to
ship
meal
to
china
either
or
with
lower
taxes
in
coming
years
soy
processors
are
likely
to
see
an
uptick
in
soymeal
production
as
a
result
of
new
biodiesel
blending
guidelines
approved
last
week
by
the
government
the
share
of
biodiesel
in
diesel
is
expected
to
increase
by
percentage
point
every
year
from
to
from
percent
currently
to
percent
that
should
increase
demand
for
soyoil
which
biodiesel
in
brazil
is
mostly
made
from
but
crushers
need
to
find
new
markets
for
the
extra
soymeal
created
as
a
byproduct
of
the
process
brazilian
soyoil
exports
could
fall
next
year
due
to
rising
local
demand
for
the
oil
from
biodiesel
producers
and
stable
crushing
capacity
