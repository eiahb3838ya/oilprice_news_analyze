upbeat

a

may

we

markets
do
not

be
fully
incorporating
the
risks
of
an
escalation
of

yet
which
could
have
an
effect
on
investment
sentiment
inflation
and
also
clouding
the
outlook
for
world
shares
is
the
prospect
of
tighter
monetary
policy
in
the
united
states
given
robust
economic
data
in
recent
months
the
united
states
reported
solid
jobs
growth
for
october
with
annual
wage
gains
at
highs

boosting

for
a
december

a
similarly
upbeat
number
back
in

sent
global
financial
markets
in
a
tailspin
with
a
massive
in
bonds
and
equities
particularly
in
emerging
markets
and
a
strong
rally
in
the
dollar

employment
report
supports
our
view
that
the
federal
reserve
will
raise
rates
three
more
times

economics
said
in
a
note
after
that
we
suspect
that
the
cumulative
effect
of
monetary
policy
tightening
will
start
taking
a
toll
on
the

economy

jumped

gingerly

over
tense
trade
relations
with
just
five
months

go

britain
exits
the
european
union
divorce
talks
are
at
an
impasse

times
report
that
an
customs
deal
will
be
written
into
the
agreement
governing
britain
s
withdrawal
from
the
european
union
was
enough
to
send
the
pound
to
its
highest
since
may
s
office
said
the
sunday
times
report
was
speculative
but
added
that
percent
of
the
withdrawal
agreement
was
settled
and
negotiations
were
ongoing
the
