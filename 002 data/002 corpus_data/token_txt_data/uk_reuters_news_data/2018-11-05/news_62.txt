sterling
jumped
to
a
high
on
monday
on
hopes
britain
was
inching
closer
to
a
smooth
brexit
while
asian
stocks
started
the

gingerly
amid
worries
about
tense
trade

just
five

exits
the

divorce
talks
are
at
an
impasse
fuelling
severe
uncertainty
among
businesses
and
whipsawing
sterling
on
any
news
of
a
possible
breakthrough
in
the
negotiations
a
sunday
times
report
that
an
customs
deal
will
be
written
into
the
agreement
governing
britain
s
withdrawal
from
the
eu
was
enough
to
cheer
investors

to
the
highest

midterm

opinion
polls
show
a
strong
chance
that
the

could
win
control

years

no

political
power

a
reuters
analysis
of
the
past
half
century
shows
stocks
fared
better
in
the
two
calendar
years
after
congressional
elections
when
republicans
control
congress
and
the
presidency
than
when
democrats
controlled
the
two
branches
as
well
as
during
times
of
gridlock
the
outlook
for
global
shares
has
also
been
clouded
by
the
prospect
of
faster
rate
rises
in
the
united
states
given
robust
economic
data
in
recent
months
the
united
states
reported
solid
jobs
growth
for
october
with
annual
wages
gain
at
highs
further
boosting
expectations
for
a
december
rate
rise
the

report
supports
our
view
that
the
federal
reserve
will
raise
rates
three
more
times

economics
said

after

we
suspect
that
the
cumulative
effect

economy
forcing
