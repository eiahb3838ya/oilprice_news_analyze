iran
said
it
would
defy
tough
sanctions
reimposed
by
washington
on
monday
dismissing
as
economic
war
the
drive
to
curb
tehran
s
missile
and
nuclear
programs
and
diminish
its
influence
in
the
middle
east
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
said
the
bullying
restoration
of
oil
and
banking
curbs
was
backfiring
by
making
washington
more
isolated
a
reference
to
other
world
powers
opposed
to
the
initiative
the
reimposition
of
sanctions
lifted
under
a
nuclear
deal
adds
new
designations
in
iran
s
oil
shipping
insurance
and
banking
sectors
to
try
to
sharply
reduce
the
country
s
petroleum
revenues
a
mainstay
of
its
economy
european
powers
which
continue
to
back
the
nuclear
deal
said
they
opposed
the
reapplication
of
sanctions
and
major
oil
buyer
china
said
it
regretted
the
move
the
move
is
part
of
a
wider
effort
by
president
donald
trump
to
force
iran
to
further
limit
its
nuclear
work
and
halt
a
missile
program
as
well
as
end
its
support
for
proxy
forces
in
yemen
syria
lebanon
and
other
parts
of
the
middle
east
switzerland
said
it
was
holding
talks
with
the
united
states
and
iran
about
launching
a
humanitarian
payment
channel
to
help
food
and
drugs
keep
flowing
to
tehran
sanctions
permit
trade
in
humanitarian
goods
such
as
food
and
pharmaceuticals
but
measures
imposed
on
banks
and
trade
restrictions
could
make
such
items
more
expensive
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
on
sunday
the
penalties
returning
on
monday
were
the
toughest
sanctions
ever
put
in
place
on
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
however
iran
s
clerical
rulers
have
dismissed
concerns
about
the
impact
of
sanctions
on
the
economy
today
the
enemy
the
united
states
is
targeting
our
economy
the
main
target
of
sanctions
is
our
people
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
said
america
wanted
to
cut
to
zero
iran
s
oil
sales
but
we
will
continue
to
sell
our
oil
to
break
sanctions
rouhani
told
economists
adding
the
sanctions
were
illegal
and
unfair
this
is
an
economic
war
against
iran
but
america
should
learn
that
it
can
not
use
the
language
of
force
against
iran
we
are
prepared
to
resist
any
pressure
rouhani
said
foreign
minister
zarif
said
washington
had
made
itself
more
isolated
by
pursuing
the
sanctions
us
bullying
is
backfiring
the
us
and
not
iran
is
isolated
zarif
said
in
a
tweet
trump
announced
in
may
his
government
was
withdrawing
from
what
he
called
the
worst
ever
agreement
negotiated
by
the
united
states
the
other
parties
to
the
deal
britain
france
germany
china

last

that
a
new
eu
mechanism
to
facilitate

for
iranian
oil
exports
should
be
legally
in
place
by
but
not
operational
until
early
next
year
we
continue
to
believe
that
the
iran
nuclear
deal
makes
the
world
a
safer
place
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
spokesman
said
as
long
as

britain
would
be
committed
to
it
too
china
india
south
korea
japan
and
turkey
all
top
importers
of
iranian
oil
are
among
eight
countries
expected
to
be
given
temporary
exemptions
from
the
sanctions
to
ensure
crude
oil
prices
are
not
destabilised
the
countries
will
deposit
iran
s
revenue
in
an
escrow
account
and
the
funds
will
be
used
for
humanitarian
purposes
according
to
us
officials
news
of
the
waivers
initially
helped
lower
oil
prices
early
on
monday
since
they
allow
major
buyers
to
import
iran
s
oil
for
a
while
but
brent

at
rouhani
said
even
without
the
waivers
iran
would
still
be
able
to
sell
its
oil
tasnim
news
agency
reported
the
curbs
come
as
the
united
states
is
focused
on
congressional
and
gubernatorial
elections
on
tuesday
campaigning
in
chattanooga
tennessee
on
sunday
trump
said
his
maximum
pressure
against
iran
was
working
iran
is
a
much
different
country
than
it
was
when
i
took
office
said
trump
adding
they
wanted
to
take
over
the
whole
middle
east
right
now
they
just
want
to
to
keep
the
deal
alive
the
remaining
parties
to
the
iran
accord
are
trying
to
maintain
trade
with
tehran
despite
scepticism
that
this
is
possible
