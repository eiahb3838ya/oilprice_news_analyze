sanctions
have
already
cost
iran
billions
of
dollars
in
oil
revenue
since
may
when
president
donald
trump
pulled
out
of
the
nuclear
deal
special
representative
for
iran
brian
hook
told
reporters
on
a
call
on
monday
our
oil
sanctions
have
taken
off
million
barrels
of
iranian
oil
off
the
market
and
that
alone
has
reduced
the
regime
s
revenues
by
more
than
billion
he
said
he
did
not
explain
the
figures
further
at
present
prices
a
reduction
of
million
barrels
per
day
in
iranian
exports
would
reduce
its
revenue
by
around
billion
per
month
the
united
states
imposed
strict
sanctions
on
iran
s
vital
energy
sector
on
monday
which
were
lifted
under
iran
s
nuclear
deal
with
major
powers
washington
granted
waivers
to
countries
the
measures
are
part
of
a
wider
effort
by
president
donald
trump
to
curb
tehran
s
missile
and
nuclear
programs
and
diminish
the
islamic
republic
s
influence
in
the
middle
east
allies
in
europe
which
backed
the
agreement
under
which
iran
agreed
to
curb
its
nuclear
program
in
return
for
the
lifting
of
sanctions
oppose
trump
s
move
hook
said
washington
did
not
expect
restored
oil
sanctions
against
tehran
to
have
a
negative
impact
on
a
market
that
is
and
balanced
some
countries
that
imported
iranian
oil
prior
to
may
have
zeroed
their
input
because
of
our
sanctions
more
than
major
companies
have
withdrawn
their
business
from
iran
or
canceled
their
planned
investment
leading
to
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
in
lost
investment
hook
said
other
signatories
of
the
nuclear
deal
have
been
trying
to
save
the
accord
since
trump
exited
the
pact
washington
reimposed
first
round
of
sanctions
on
tehran
in
august
hook
said
washington
believed
that
the
iranian
nation
had
lost
their
confidence
in
their
clerical
rulers
the
iranian
people
have
had
years
of
economic
mismanagement
they
know
very
well
that
their
economic
problems
are
caused
by
the
iranian
regime
and
not
the
united
states
