wrapup 8-u.s. reimposes iran sanctions, tehran decries 'bullying'
reuters
the
united
states
on
monday
restored
sanctions
targeting
iran
s
oil
banking
and
transportation
sectors
and
threatened
more
action
to
stop
its
outlaw
policies
steps
the
islamic
republic
called
economic
warfare
and
vowed
to
defy
the
measures
are
part
of
a
wider
effort
by
president
donald
trump
to
curb
tehran
s
missile
and
nuclear
programs
and
diminish
the
islamic
republic
s
influence
in
the
middle
east
notably
its
support
for
proxies
in
syria
yemen
and
lebanon
trump
s
moves
target
iran
s
main
source
of
revenue
its
oil
exports
as
well
as
its
financial
sector
essentially
making
iranian
banks
and
their
subsidiaries
off
limits
to
foreign
banks
on
pain
of
losing
access
to
the
financial
system
the
return
of
the
sanctions
was
triggered
by
trump
s
may
decision
to
abandon
the
iran
nuclear
deal
negotiated
with
five
other
world
powers
during
democratic
president
barack
obama
s
administration
that
agreement
had
removed
many
and
other
economic
sanctions
from
iran
in
return
for
tehran
s
commitment
to
curtail
its
nuclear
programme
trump
denounced
the
deal
because
of
time
limits
on
some
of
iran
s
nuclear
activities
as
well
as
for
its
failure
to
address
other
iranian
activity
that
the
united
states
does
not
like
in
abandoning
the
agreement
and
imposing
sanctions
that
it
had
lifted
as
well
as
adding
new
ones
the
united
states
is
betting
the
economic
pressure
will
force
iran
to
change
its
behaviour
and
agree
to
a
new
much
more
restrictive
deal
the
iranian
regime
has
a
choice
it
can
either
do
a
turn
from
its
outlaw
course
of
action
and
act
like
a
normal
country
or
it
can
see
its
economy
crumble
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
told
reporters
we
hope
a
new
agreement
with
iran
is
speaking
before
pompeo
detailed
the
sanctions
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
accused
the
united
states
of
targeting
ordinary
iranians
and
said
the
islamic
republic
would
find
a
way
to
continue
to
sell
our
oil
to
break
the
enemy
is
targeting
our
economy
the
main
target
of
sanctions
is
our
people
he
said
this
is
an
economic
war
against
some
analysts
are
sceptical
iran
will
knuckle
under
to
pressure
at
least
in
the
short
term
the
increasing
pressures
on
iran
will
not
change
the
behaviour
of
the
regime
any
time
soon
said
dennis
ross
a
former
official
now
at
the
washington
institute
for
near
east
policy
iranian
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
said
bullying
was
backfiring
by
making
washington
more
isolated
a
reference
to
other
world
powers
opposed
to
the
initiative
the
other
parties
to
the
nuclear
deal
britain
china
france
germany
and
russia
have
said
they
will
stay
in
it
the
sanctions
are
designed
in
part
to
force
iran
s
main
customers
to
stop
buying
its
oil
however
the
united
states
gave
temporary
exceptions
to
eight
importers
china
india
greece
italy
taiwan
japan
turkey

amount
of

to
iraq
s
southern
ports
on
the

the

iranian
banks
and
subsidiaries
more
than
persons

vessels
in
its
shipping
sector
tehran
s
national
airline
iran
air
and
more
than
of
its
aircraft
a
treasury
statement
said
the
administration
said
it
had
toughened
the
sanctions
by
roughly
new
designations
on
individuals
and
entities
and
targeted
more
subsidiaries
of
iranian
companies
than
before
european
powers

continue
to
back

opposed
the
reapplication

the
united

launching
a
humanitarian

to
help
food
and
drugs
keep
flowing
to
tehran
sanctions
permit
trade
in
humanitarian
goods
such
as
food
and
pharmaceuticals
but
measures
imposed
on
banks
and
trade
restrictions
could
make
such
items
more
expensive
as
well
as
more
difficult
to
pay
for
the
united
states
will
allow
civil
nuclear
work
at
arak
bushehr
and
fordow
in
iran
under

of
the
stability
and
integrity
of
the
global
financial
system
