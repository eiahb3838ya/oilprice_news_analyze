supreme
court
justices
hearing
a
challenge
to
virginia
s
moratorium
on
uranium
mining
struggled
on
monday
over
how
far
states
can
go
to
ban
mining
of
the
radioactive
metal
for
public
health
reasons
before
overstepping
federal
law
the
justices
heard
an
hour
of
arguments
in
an
appeal
by
a
company
called
virginia
uranium
inc
seeking
to
revive
a
lawsuit
thrown
out
by
a
lower
court
that
aimed
to
invalidate
virginia
s
ban
enacted
in
because
it
conflicted
with
a
federal
law
that
regulates
nuclear
power
generation
at
the
center
of
the
dispute
is
the
uranium
deposit
located
beneath
a
privately
owned
estate
in
pittsylvania
county
in
southern
virginia
near
the
north
carolina
border
the
company
a
subsidiary
of
vancouver
british
virginia
energy
resources
is
seeking
to
exploit
the
deposit
valued
at
about
billion
uranium
a
main
source
of
fuel
for
nuclear
power
plants
and
material
in
nuclear
warheads
represents
a
vital
resource
for
electricity
and
national
defense
the
case
could
clarify
how
far
states
can
go
in
regulating
access
to
uranium
resources
virginia
enacted
its
ban
on
uranium
mining
amid
concerns
about
environmental
and
public
safety
hazards
liberal
justice
stephen
breyer
and
conservative
justice
samuel
alito
signaled
that
courts
should
look
to
the
virginia
legislators
motives
in
passing
the
law
to
determine
whether
it
regulates
only
mining
as
virginia
argues
or
tries
to
curb
radiological
hazards
a
matter
that
must
be
left
to
the
federal
government
i
think
that
s
our
job
as
a
court
in
a
relevant
case
to
determine
what
the
purpose
is
breyer
said
some
liberal
justices
as
well
as
conservative
justice
neil
gorsuch
appeared
to
side
with
the
state
gorsuch
said
the
congress
could
have
prevented
states
from
regulating
uranium
mining
but
did
not
the
company
backed
by
president
donald
trump
s
administration
has
extolled
the
economic
benefits
for
virginia
saying
uranium
mining
could
mean
more
than
a
thousand
jobs
annually
and
billions
of
dollars
for
the
local
economy
it
has
also
emphasized
uranium
s
critical
importance
in
nuclear
weapons
and
powering
the
country
s
nuclear
submarines
and
aircraft
carriers
noting
that
most
uranium
used
in
the
united
states
is
imported
including
percent
from
geopolitical
rivals
including
russia
the
dispute
concerns
whether
the
federal
atomic
energy
act
of
preempts
virginia
s
mining
ban
under
the
constitution
s
supremacy
clause
which
holds
that
federal
law
generally
trumps
state
law
the
atomic
energy
act
gives
the
federal
nuclear
regulatory
commission
the
sole
power
to
regulate
radiation
safety
standards
for
milling
uranium
ore
and
disposing
of
waste
byproducts
known
as
tailings
key
steps
in
the
production
of
nuclear
fuel
but
it
does
not
cover
conventional
uranium
mining
on
land
virginia
has
said
federal
law
specifically
allows
it
to
ban
uranium
mining
it
has
the
support
of
several
other
states
concerned
about
protecting
states
rights
including
indiana
texas
massachusetts
and
oregon
the
plaintiffs
also
including
cole

and
bowen

the
state
in
the
richmond

court
of
