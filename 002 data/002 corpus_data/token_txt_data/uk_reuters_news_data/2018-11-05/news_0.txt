and
spur
economic
growth

and
advance
other
conservative
measures
expected
by
his
voters
said

said
that
includes
giving
police
more
powers

fire
on
armed
criminals
easing

from
the
age

which
young
people
can
be
criminally
prosecuted
and
enacting
legislation
that
make
land
invasions
acts
of
terrorism
a
bill
to
remove
politics
and
teaching
of
sexual
diversity
in
schools
is
another
priority
for
the
christian
voters
who
helped
get
bolsonaro
elected
she
said
this
agenda
can
not
be
delayed
because
bolsonaro

these
reasons

a
retired

would
like
to
see

the
pension
reform
proposal
already
in
congress
passed
before
bolsonaro
takes
office
to
relieve
pressure
and
save
political
capital
if
we
can
not
get
anything
approved
this
year
we
will
do
some
kind
of
reform
at
the
beginning
of
next
year
bolsonaro
said
in
an
interview
with
tv
band
he
said
his
plan
is
to

taxes
in
a
responsible
way
and
ruled
out
reviving
a
despised
tax
on
transactions
known
as
the
cpmf
to
raise
fiscal
revenues
bolsonaro
s
political
advisers
including
kicis
worry
that
a
focus
on
unavoidable
and
unpopular
austerity
policies
will
dash
the
expectations
of
his
supporters
kicis
who
is
urging
a
mixed
agenda
that
will
keep
voters
happy
aims
to
become
chair
of
the
constitutional
and
legal
affairs
committee
that
is
key
to
passing
legislation
in
the
lower
chamber
bolsonaro
s
party
rose
from
nowhere
to
gain
seats
in
the
lower
chamber
four
short
of
the
leftist
workers
party
kicis
said
she
expects
bolsonaro
s
psl
party
to
become
the
largest
in
congress
with
more
than
a
dozen
lawmakers
joining
from
other
small
parties
it
should
enjoy
a
safe
majority
with
the
backing
of
the
farm
evangelical
and
caucuses
that
supported
the
former
army
captain
s
candidacy
