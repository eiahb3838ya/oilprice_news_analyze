when
the
worst
floods
in
a
century
swept
through
india
s
southern
kerala
state
in
august
they
killed
more
than
people
and
left
behind
more
than
billion
in
damage
but
one
thing
survived
unscathed
india
s
first
floating
solar
panels
on
one
of
the
country
s
largest
water
reservoirs
as
india
grapples
with
wilder
weather
surging
demand
for
power
and
a
goal
to
nearly
quintuple
the
use
of
solar
energy
in
just
four
years
we
are
very
much
excited
about
floating
solar
said
shailesh
mishra
director
of
power
systems
at
the
government
solar
energy
corporation
of
india
india
is
planning
new
installations
of
the
technology
on
hydropower
reservoirs
and
other
water
bodies
in
tamil
nadu
jharkhand
and
uttarakhand
states
and
in
the
lakshadweep
islands
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
cost
is
coming
almost
to
the
same
level
as
ground
solar
and
then
it
will
go
forward
very
fast
he
predicted
as
countries
move
to
swiftly
scale
up
solar
power
to
meet
growing
demand
for
energy
and
to
try
to
curb
climate
change
floating
solar
panels
installed
on
reservoirs
or
along
coastal
areas
are
fast
gaining
popularity
particularly
in
asia
experts
say
the
panels
now
in
place
from
china
to
the
maldives
to
britain
get
around
some
of
the
biggest
problems
facing
traditional
solar
farms
particularly
a
lack
of
available
land
said
oliver
knight
a
senior
energy
specialist
with
the
world
bank
the
water
body
is
already
there
you
don
t
need
to
go
out
and
find
it
he
said
in
a
telephone
interview
and
siting
solar
arrays
on
water
most
cover
up
to
percent
of
a
reservoir
can
cut
evaporation
as
well
a
significant
benefit
in
places
knight
said
pakistan
s
new
government
for
instance
is
talking
about
using
floating
solar
panels
on
water
reservoirs
near
karachi
and
hyderabad
both
to
provide
power
and
to
curb
water
losses
as
climate
change
brings
hotter
temperatures
and
more
evaporation
he
said
solar
arrays
on
hydropower
dams
also
can
take
advantage
of
existing
power
transmission
lines
and
excess
solar
can
be
used
to
pump
water
effectively
storing
it
as
hydropower
potential
china
currently
has
the
most
of
the
gigawatts
of
floating
solar
generating
capacity
now
installed
according
to
the
world
bank
but
the
technology
s
potential
is
much
bigger
about
gigawatts
or
about
as
much
generating
capacity
as
all
the
solar
photovoltaic
panels
installed
in
the
world
through
the
bank
said
if
you
covered
percent
of
manmade
water
bodies
you
re
already
looking
at
gigawatts
knight
said
that
s
very
growing
use
of
the
technology
has
raised
fears
that
it
could
block
sun
into
reservoirs
affecting
wildlife
and
ecosystems
or
that
electrical
systems
might
not
stand
up
to
a
watery
environment
particularly
in
salty
coastal
waters
but
backers
say
that
while
environmental
concerns
need
to
be
better
studied
the
relatively
small
amount
of
surface
area
covered
by
the
panels
at
least
at
the
moment
doesn
t
appear
to
create
significant
problems
people
worried
what
will
happen
to
fish
to
water
quality
said
india
s
mishra
now
all
that
attention
has
what
may
be
more
challenging
is
keeping
panels
working
and
free
of
colonising
sea
creatures
in
corrosively
salty
coastal
installations
which
account
for
a
relatively
small
percentage
of
total
projects
so
far
noted
thomas
reindl
of
the
solar
energy
research
institute
of
singapore
he
said
he
expects
the
technology
will
draw
more
investment
when
durability
and
reliability
has
been
proven
in
real
world
installations
currently
floating
solar
arrays
cost
about
percent
more
than
traditional
solar
photovoltaic
arrays
knight
said
but
that
cost
is
often
offset
by
other
lower
costs
in
many
places
one
has
to
pay
for
land
for
resettlement
of
people
or
preparing
and
leveling
land
and
building
roads
he
said
with
floating
solar
you
avoid
quite
a
bit
of
solar
panels
used
on
water
which
cools
them
also
can
produce
about
percent
more
electricity
he
said
mishra
said
that
while
in
his
view
india
has
sufficient
land
for
traditional
solar
installations
much
of
it
is
in
remote
areas
inhospitable
to
agriculture
including
deserts
putting
solar
panels
on
water
by
comparison
cuts
transmission
costs
by
moving
power
generation
closer
to
the
people
who
need
the
energy
he
said
he
said
india
already
makes
the
solar
panels
it
needs
and
is
now
setting
up
manufacturing
for
the
floats
and
anchors
needed
for
floating
solar
systems
when
that
capacity
is
in
place
then
the
cost
will
automatically
come
down
