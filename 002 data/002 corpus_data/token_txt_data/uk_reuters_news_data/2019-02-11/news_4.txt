reuters
venezuela
s
nicolas
maduro
has
sought
opec
support
against
sanctions
imposed
on
his
country
s
oil
industry
citing
their
impact
on
oil
prices
and
potential
risks
for
other
members
of
the
producer
group
but
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
the
organisation
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
of
which
venezuela
is
a
founding
member
had
declined
to
make
any
formal
statement
opec
says
it
is
concerned
with
oil
policy
not
politics
more
than
nations
including
the
united
states
european
powers
and
most
of
latin
america
have
recognised
maduro
s
rival
juan
guaido
as
the
country
s
rightful
head
of
state
following
disputed
elections
last
year
the
request
was
made
in
a
letter
sent
to
opec
mohammad
barkindo
dated
and
seen
by
reuters
a
day
after
the
united
states
imposed
sanctions
on
venezuelan
state
oil
firm
pdvsa
our
country
hopes
to
receive
the
solidarity
and
full
support
of
the
member
countries
of
opec
and
its
ministerial
conference
in
the
fight
we
are
currently
having
against
the
illegal
and
arbitrary
intrusion
of
the
united
states
in
the
internal
affairs
of
venezuela
maduro
wrote
i
seek
your
firm
support
and
collaboration
to
jointly
denounce
and
face
this
shameless
dispossession
of
important
assets
of
one
of
the
members
of
opec
the
letter
said
he
wrote
that
opec
should
help
to
determine
potential
solutions
based
on
the
impact
that
this
action
has
on
the
global
energy
market
and
the
risk
it
represents
for
the
other
countries
of
this
organisation
the
sanctions
on
venezuela
have
boosted
global
oil
prices
which
were
trading
at
around
a
barrel
on
monday
the
move
has
disrupted
shipments
as
more
than
tankers
loaded
with
venezuelan
oil
have
been
anchored
off
the
gulf
coast
still
analysts
say
there
is
ample
spare
capacity
in
other
oil
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
plus
strategic
reserves
in
consuming
nations
to
compensate
for
a
loss
of
venezuela
s
exports
opec
tends
to
avoid
political
disputes
involving
individual
members
last
year
it
declined
a
request
from
iran
for
a
discussion
of
sanctions
against
tehran
at
a
meeting
venezuela
was
once
a
opec
oil
producer
but
production
has
been
in
decline
for
years
following
the
collapse
of
the
country
s
economy
energy
research
and
consulting
firm
rystad
sees
venezuelan
production
plummeting
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
next
year
from
million

of
venezuela
pumped
million

at
the
turn
of
the
century
together

libya
and

venezuela
is

from
the
latest
