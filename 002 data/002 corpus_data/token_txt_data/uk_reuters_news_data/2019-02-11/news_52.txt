once

a
time
storytelling
is
one
of
the
most
fundamental
human
impulses
humans
have
been
telling
stories
for
thousands
of
years
as
a
means
of
entertainment
but
more
importantly
to
help
them
make
sense
of
the
world
around
them
and
to
transmit
that
understanding
to
others
narratives
are
a
way
of
organising
a
series
of
actions
or
events
to
understand
the
process
of
cause
and
effect
helping
make
sense
of
the
past
and
anticipate
the
future
anthropologists
who
conduct
research
on
the
behaviour
of
diverse
tribes
around
the
world
have
observed
a
universal
that
people
use
narrative
to
explain
how
things
came
to
be
and
to
tell
stories
visitors
to
any
human
society
will
observe
people
facing
each
other
sitting
around
the
television
or
the
campfire
together
and
vocalising
and
more
recently
tweeting
stories
according
to
economist
robert
shiller
it
seems
the
human
mind
strives
to
reach
enduring
understanding
of
events
by
forming
them
into
a
narrative
that
is
imbedded
in
social
interactions

earnings
call
satisfying
stories
obey
a
few
simple
rules
good
stories
start
at
the
beginning
once
upon
a
time
and
move
linearly
through
a
sequence
of
events
to
a
conclusion
the
end
cause
and
effect
are
closely
and
intuitively
linked
and
should
be
roughly
proportionate
to
one
another
big
consequences
should
stem
from
big
causes
each
effect
should
have
a
single
cause
or
at
most
a
small
and
easily
comprehended
number
rather
than
result
from
the
complex
and
incomprehensible
interaction
among
many
causes
heroes
and
villains
should
be
clearly
identified
and
eventually
be
rewarded
or
punished
by
the
chain
of
events
according
to
some
definition
of
morality
luck
chance
and
randomness
can
play
a
part
but
hard
work
intelligence
worthiness
and
free
will
are
more
important
in
determining
outcomes
the
problem
with
the
campfire
model
linear
proportionate
moral
and
determinant
is
that
it
fails
to
explain
many
important
processes
which
are
exponential
amoral
and
random
financial
market
movements
business
cycles
oil
cycles
and
even
the
rise
and
fall
of
companies
corporate
leaders
and
politicians
none
of
them
can
be
properly
explained
and
predicted
by
the
traditional
narrative
model
in
these
real
examples
processes
are
complex
do
not
always
produce
virtuous
winners
and
often
do
not
lead
to
clear
outcomes
and
predictions
descriptions
of
processes
often
fail
as
satisfying
stories
while
emotionally
pleasing
stories
often
fail
to
explain
and
predict
the
real
world
properly
politicians
business
leaders
campaigners
and
opinion
formers
often
prefer
simpler
narratives
that
provide
a
more
satisfying
explanation
stir
an
emotional
response
and
serve
as
a
call
to
action
the
narratives
used
to
frame
and
explain
an
issue
can
have
a
powerful
impact
on
how
businesses
employees
customers
and
voters
respond
and
the
choices
they
make
sometimes
unconsciously
storytelling
can
influence
the
real
world
as
much
as
the
other
way
around
so
narratives
can
be
instruments
of
power
whether
they
are
right
or
wrong
but
forecasters
and
analysts
should
prefer
accurate
descriptions
of
real
processes
for
all
their
limits
of
complexity
and
indeterminacy
the
limits
of
predicting
outcomes
from
circular
and
complex
processes
with
a
significant
random
element
mean
forecasts
should
normally
be
expressed
as
scenarios
with
an
associated
probability
distribution
even
then
many
forecasts
are
to
small
changes
in
the
starting
point
or
assumptions
about
the
causation
process
so
the
probability
distribution
itself
is
often
highly
unstable
or
uncertain
forecasters
should
always
be
humble
about
their
ability
to
make
accurate
predictions
especially
far
into
the
future
or
when
many
variables
are
changing
simultaneously
often
the
most
useful
part
of
forecasting
is
the
discipline
of
having
to
think
in
a
rigorous
way
identifying
and
analysing
all
the
potential
variables
in
play
getting
a
better
sense
of
the
range
of
uncertainty
once
the
key
variables
have
been
identified
some
risks
can
be
eliminated
transformed
insured
or
managed
while
others
simply
have
to
be
borne
campfire
storytellers
are
judged
by
the
emotional
satisfaction
their
narratives
provide
forecasters
and
analysts
should
expect
to
be
judged
by
a
different
standard
acknowledging
and
embracing
uncertainty
is
not
a
sign
of
failure
or
lack
of
courage
but
an
honest
admission
of
the
limits
of
forecasting
and
of
the
complex
way
in
which
processes
evolve
