rouhani
said
iran
was
facing
its
worst
economic
crisis
since
the
shah
was
toppled
but
he
remained
defiant
as
iranians
recalled
the
end
of
a
monarch
who
catered
to
the
rich
and
unleashed
secret
police
on
dissenters
in
a
speech
at
tehran
s
azadi
freedom
square
rouhani
said
efforts
to
isolate
iran
would
fail
we
will
not
let

become
iranian
people
have
and
will
have
some
economic
difficulties

we

overcome
the
problems
