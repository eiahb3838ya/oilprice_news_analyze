venezuela
s
nicolas
maduro
has
sought
opec
support
against
sanctions
imposed
on
his
country
s
oil
industry
citing
their
impact
on
oil
prices
and
potential
risks
for
other
members
of
the
producer
group
but
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
of
which
venezuela
is
a
founding
member
had
declined
to
make
any
formal
statement
opec
says
it
is
concerned
with
oil
policy
not
politics
more
than
nations
including
the
united
states
european
powers
and
most
of
latin
america
have
recognised
maduro
s
rival
juan
guaido
as
the
country
s
rightful
head
of
state
following
disputed
elections
last
year
the
request
was
made
in
a
letter
sent
to
opec

barkindo
dated

our
country
hopes
to
receive
the
solidarity
and
full
support
of
the
member
countries
of
opec
and
its
ministerial
conference
in
the
fight
we
are
currently
having
against

illegal
and
arbitrary
intrusion
of
the
united
states
in
the
internal
affairs
of
venezuela
maduro
wrote
i
seek
your
firm
support
and
collaboration
to
jointly
denounce
and
face
this
shameless
dispossession
of
important
assets
of
one
of
the
members
of
opec
the
letter
said
he
wrote
that
opec
should
help
to
determine
potential
solutions
based
on
the
impact
that
this
action
has
on
the
global
energy
market
and
the
risk
it
represents
for
the
other
countries
of
this
organization
opec
tends
to
avoid
political
disputes
involving
individual
members
last
year
it
declined
a
request
from
iran
for
a
discussion
of
sanctions
against
tehran
at

meeting
venezuela
was
once
a
opec
oil
producer

for
years
following
