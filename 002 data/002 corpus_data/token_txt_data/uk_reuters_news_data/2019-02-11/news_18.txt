sour

showed
the
forceful
implementation
of
sanctions
on
venezuelan
crude
exports
the
recent
saudi
crude
output
cut
and
the
uncertainty
over
sanction
exemptions
on
iranian
crude
have
all
served
to
strengthen
sour
crudes
relative
to
sweet

a
analyst
at

muse
stancil
sanctions
on
venezuela
suddenly
halted
its
crude
exports
to
the
united
states
last
month
and
created
a
strong
pull
for
medium
and
heavy
sour
crude
from
other
places
said
the
traders
and
analysts
the
sanctions
aimed
at
blocking
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
s
access
to
the
nation
s
oil
revenue
will
be
extended
to
oil
buyers
from

potentially
stopping
them
from
paying
for
venezuelan
oil
in
dollars
elsewhere
uncertainty
over
whether
washington
will
in

extend
waivers
to
sanctions
on
tehran
s
oil
exports
that
it
previously
granted
to
top
iranian
crude
buyers
china
india
japan
and
south
korea
is
also
boosting
middle
east
oil
prices
and
a
decision
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
russia
to
rein
in
oil
output
has
buoyed
sour
crude
prices
as
well
market
observers
expect
middle

producers
to
cut
output
of
heavier
oil
to
meet
the
curbs

rise
above
brent
see
strong
demand
from
the
united
states
for
heavy
oil
to
replace
venezuelan
supplies
has
boosted
prices
for
mars
crude
and
latin
american
grades
restricting
supplies
of
those
cargoes
to
asia
traders
said
offers
of
mars
crude
for
april
delivery
to

asia
have
risen
more
than
a
barrel
while
spot
premiums
for
latin
american
grades
such
as
castilla
from
colombia
have
climbed
by
a
barrel
traders
said
castilla
was
sold
out
even
before
its

was
released

one
of
the
traders
the

declined
to

identified
as
they
were
not
authorised
to

refiners
are
also
seeking
more
supplies
from
the
middle
east
creating
a
pull
for
such
barrels
at
a
time
when
asia
s
sour
oil
demand
is
growing
as
two
new
refineries
have
started
trial
runs
in
china
and
malaysia
meanwhile
refiners
globally
are
also
processing
more
medium
and
heavy
crude
to
reap
higher
profits
from
fuel
oil
and
middle
distillates
that
has
kept
the
price
gap
between
saudi
s
arab
light
and
arab
heavy
crude
in
asia
close
to
the
narrowest
in
