dreyfus
expects
faster
switching
between

production
in

with
more

mills
leading
to
dramatic
shifts
usually
you
have
to
see
sugar
playing
a
premium
over
ethanol
or
the
opposite
for
a
period
of
time
before
you
start
seeing

at
louis
dreyfus
which
has
a
controlling
interest
in
brazilian
sugar
and
ethanol
maker
biosev
sa
said
depressed
sugar
prices
have
led
brazilian
companies
to
increase
their
capacity
to
produce
ethanol
with
many
mills
able
to
switch
between
using
cane
to
produce
either
sugar
or
biofuel
ethanol
depending
on
which
is
more
profitable
recently
the
industry
is
learning
to
become
more
pragmatic
and
more
economics
driven
the
low
sugar
price
is
a
driver
by
itself
so
the
mills
have
to
be
more
flexible
in
order
to
generate
more

monday
biancheri
also
said
he
expected
consolidation
within
the
brazilian
milling
industry
to
continue
with
the
best
performers
buying
up
assets
from
those
that
are
financially
stressed
meanwhile
gareth
griffiths
chief
executive
of
alvean
said
prices
were
at
the
tipping
point
for
sugar
and
ethanol
alvean
the
largest
sugar
trader
globally
is
expecting
a
slight
sugar
surplus
for
of
around
million
tonnes
analysts
have
been
expecting
a
small
sugar
deficit
for
the
period
after
years
of
surplus
that
have
depressed
prices
this
view
was
supported
by
sucden
general
manager
thierry
songeur
who
predicted
a
slight
deficit
by
the
end
of
with
india
the
unknown
quantity
india
could
export
as
much
as
million
tonnes
to
the
market
this
year
and
a
switch
to
more
ethanol
production
will
not
take
place
in
the
short
term
to
get
rid
of
its
surplus
he
said
ethanol
will
not
be
your
remedy
in
the
short
biancheri
also
said
anticipation
about
the
potential
for
ethanol
in
india
had
been
going
on
for
quite
some
time
but
the
steps
needed
were
not
being
taken
quickly
enough
it
will
be
more
of
a
mid
to
long
term
