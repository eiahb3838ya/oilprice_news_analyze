bangkok
reuters
the
political
career
of
thailand
s
princess
ubolratana
rajakanya
sirivadhana
barnavadi
lasted
only
three
days
but
in
that
time
her
declaration
that
she
would
be
a
candidate
for
prime
minister
in
a
march
election
shook
up
the
kingdom
for
the
sister
of
king
maha
vajiralongkorn
to
enter
politics
was
shocking
enough
but
what
threatened
to
upend
thailand
s
political
dynamic
was
the
fact
that
she
declared
her
candidacy
for
a
populist
party
linked
to
an
exiled
former
prime
minister
by
monday
the
country
s
election
commission
had
disqualified
the
princess
from
taking
part
in
the
election
echoing
the
words
of
the
king
himself
who
said
on
friday
her
candidacy
was
inappropriate
still
even
though
the
princess
won
t
be
a
candidate
in
the
march
vote
her
political
ambitions
and
the
populists
audacious
gambit
in
nominating
her
could
linger
in
voters
minds
the
election
is
the
first
since
a
military
coup
and
will
pit
allies
of
ousted
minister
thaksin
shinawatra
against
urban
and
middle
class
opponents
espousing
extreme
devotion
to
the
thai
monarchy
thaksin
or
his
proxies
have
won
every
election
in
thailand
since
with
its
nomination
of
the
king
s
sister
for
prime
minister
the
thai
raksa
chart
party
sought
to
flip
the
longstanding
charge
by
opponents
that
thaksin
and
his
allies
were
insufficiently
loyal
to
the
monarchy
the
royal
family
is
revered
in
thailand
as
insulting
the
monarchy
is
against
the
law
punished
by
up
to
years
in
prison
by
longstanding
tradition
the
royal
family
have
kept
themselves
above
politics
as
a
symbol
of
thai
culture
since
when
protesters
drawn
mostly
from
the
and
urban
establishment
began
demonstrating
against
thaksin
s
rule
the
rallying
call
of
forces
has
been
to
protect
the
monarchy
the
early
protesters
wore
yellow
a
colour
associated
with
the
late
king
bhumibol
adulyadej
to
show
their
reverence
for
the
monarchy
and
thai
culture
that
they
said
thaksin
threatened
through
corruption
and
consolidating
his
own
personal
power
the
military
deposed
thaksin
in
and
since
then
thai
politics
have
been
locked
in
a
cycle
of
his
allies
winning
elections
and
later
being
ousted
from
power
by
court
rulings
or
coups
most
recently
in
when
the
army
overthrew
the
remnants
of
a
government
that
had
been
led
by
thaksin
s
sister
yingluck
nominating
princess
udolratana
was
thai
raksa
chart
s
attempt
to
turn
the
table
and
invoke
the
appeal
of
the
royal
family
as
a
populist
princess
but
the
gambit
was
quickly
shut
down
by
her
brother
who
ascended
to
the
throne
in
after
the
death
of
their
father
and
will
be
officially
crowned
in
may
still
the
brief
entry
of
royalty
into
politics
may
only
deepen
thailand
s
political
divisions
said
anusorn
unno
dean
of
the
faculty
of
sociology
and
anthropology
at
thammasat
university
for
thai
raksa
chart
supporters
this
has
created
more
sympathy
to
the
party
these
would
see
the
party
as
a
victim
in
this
situation
he
said
as
for
thaksin
s
opponents
they
are
likely
to
be
galvanised
by
what
they
will
see
as
an
attempt
to
manipulate
the
monarchy
