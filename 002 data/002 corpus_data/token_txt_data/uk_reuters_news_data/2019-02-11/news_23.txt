the men who would lead nigeria: the presidency, power and petroleum
reuters
nigeria
had
more
than
candidates
for
president
when
campaigning
began
for
saturday
s
elections
but
only
those
from
the
two
main
parties
president
muhammadu
buhari
and
former
vice
president
atiku
abubakar
have
a
real
shot
at
leading
africa
s
most
populous
nation
while
a
handful
of
the
other
candidates
are
touted
as
civil
society
alternatives
their
chances
of
winning
are
slim
without
the
big
parties
wealth
and
patronage
muhammadu
buhari
made
history
in
as
the
first
person
to
democratically
oust
an
incumbent
president
in
nigeria
now
as
candidate
for
the
all
progressives
congress
apc
he
is
seeking
a
second
term
it
is
his
fifth
run
at
the
presidency
a
reputation
as
a
staunch
opponent
of
corruption
was
key
to
buhari
s
victory
at
the
last
election
a
muslim
born
on
in
the
northwestern
town
of
daura
in
katsina
state
buhari
spent
his
career
in
the
army
installed
as
military
dictator
after
a
coup
in
december
his
approach
was
typified
by
policies
that
included
having
people
whipped
if
they
refused
to
queue
at
bus
stops
he
was
overthrown
less
than
two
years
later
in
another
coup
after
the
military
figures
who
installed
him
became
displeased
with
his
methods
but
buhari
s
cachet
has
remained
strong
among
his
supporters
and
helped
him
run
successfully
in
against
goodluck
jonathan
of
the
people
s
democratic
party
pdp
the
party
had
been
in
power
since
nigeria
returned
to
democracy
in
buhari
rode
a
wave
of
sentiment
coupled
with
promises
to
revive
the
stuttering
economy
and
defeat
the
boko
haram
islamist
insurgency
despite
a
lack
of
corruption
convictions
nigeria
s
first
recession
in
years
and
a
resurgence
of
islamist
attacks
those
policies
are
little
changed
for
the
race
he
earned
the
nickname
baba
go
slow
during
his
first
term
when
critics
said
he
governed
at
a
glacial
pace
particularly
when
low
oil
prices
caused
a
currency
crisis
the
moniker
first
entered
popular
usage
to
describe
buhari
when
he
took
six
months
to
appoint
a
cabinet
some
including
his
wife
have
said
access
to
buhari
is
tightly
controlled
by
close
advisers
known
in
nigeria
as
the
cabal
and
that
they
are
really
directing
policy
buhari
was
absent
for
five
months
in
being
treated
in
britain
for
an
unspecified
ailment
despite
that
illness
he
announced
in
early
that
he
would
seek
raising
concerns
about
whether
he
could
serve
another
four
years
buhari
has
said
he
has
the
energy
to
do
so
to
his
admirers
buhari
is
frugal
moral
and
prizes
loyalty
above
other
qualities
in
his
allies
a
foil
to
the
alleged
excesses
of
the
pdp
to
his
critics
he
is
an
ailing
relic
with
little
head
for
policy
and
no
concern
for
the
rule
of
law
atiku
abubakar
is
the
candidate
for
the
pdp
the
party
that
inherited
power
from
the
military
in
and
governed
for
the
next
years
for
the
first
eight
of
those
years
atiku
was
vice
president
to
nigeria
s
new
democratic
leader
and
former
military
head
of
state
olusegun
obasanjo
atiku
like
buhari
is
also
a
northern
muslim
born
in
adamawa
state
during
the
later
years
of
military
rule
he
became
a
senior
customs
official
and
later
a
businessman
with
ventures
in
port
oil
and
gas
logistics
as
well
as
a
private
university
he
sought
the
apc
presidential
ticket
for
the
elections
but
lost
to
buhari
and
threw
his
support
behind
him
funding
his
campaign
and
even
lending
him
a
private
jet
atiku
switched
sides
again
in
and
last
year
emerged
as
the
pdp
s
candidate
he
has
promised
to
make
nigeria
work
again
lifting
it
out
of
the
economic
doldrums
with
policies
that
he
says
will
create
jobs
he
has
for
years
been
dogged
by
corruption
accusations
which
he
denies
critics
say
atiku
would
use
his
policies
to
enrich
himself
and
those
around
him
without
addressing
the
poverty
that
afflicts
most
nigerians
his
supporters
hoped
to
have
put
an
end
to
some
of
those
allegations
when
atiku
travelled
to
the
united
states
last
month
after
years
of
rumours
that
he
could
not
because
of
investigations
revealing
his
ties
to
corruption
there
but
atiku
had
been
barred
from
entering
the
united
states
and
washington
only
granted
him
a
temporary
reprieve
from
the
ban
reuters
reported
last
week
to
his
supporters
atiku
is
an
accomplished
businessman
with
the
economic
credentials
needed
to
boost
growth
create
jobs
and
attract
foreign
investors
back
to
nigeria
as
it
struggles
to
recover
from
the
first
recession
in
a
generation
his
opponents
say
he
is
a
kleptocrat
who
lacks
a
moral
compass
and
consistent
ideology
