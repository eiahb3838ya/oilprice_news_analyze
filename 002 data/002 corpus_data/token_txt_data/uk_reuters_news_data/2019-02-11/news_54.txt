pompeo
visits

slovakia
and
poland
this
week
he
wants
to
make
up
for
a
lack
of
engagement
that
opened
the
door
to
more
chinese
and
russian
influence
in
central
europe
administration
officials
say
on
a
tour
that
includes
a
conference
on

hopes

build
a
coalition
against
iran

in
when
hillary
clinton
visited
on
tuesday
he
will
be
in
bratislava
slovakia
for
the
first
such
visit
in
years
this
is
overdue
and
needed
a
senior
administration
official
said
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
our
message
is
we
have
to
show
up
or
expect
to
lose
our
efforts
at
diplomatic
engagement
are
aimed
at
competing
for
positive
influence
and
giving
allies
in
the
region
an
indication
of
support
and
interest
in
order
to
have
alternatives
to
china
and
washington
is
concerned
about
china
s
growing
presence
in
particular
the
expansion
of
huawei
technologies
the
world
s
biggest
telecom
gear
maker
in
hungary
and
poland
the
united
states
and
its
western
allies
believe
huawei
s
equipment
could
be
used
for
espionage
and
see
its
expansion
into
central
europe
as
a
way
to
gain
a
foothold
in
the
eu
market
huawei
denies
engaging
in
intelligence
work
for
any
government
pompeo
will
also
voice
concerns
about
energy
ties
with
moscow
and
urge
hungary
to
not
support
the
turkstream
pipeline
part
of
the
kremlin
s
plans
to
bypass
ukraine
the
main
transit
route
for
russian
gas
to
europe
hungary
gets
most
of
its
gas
from
russia
and
its
main
domestic
source
of
electricity
is
the
paks
nuclear
power
plant
where
russia
s
rosatom
is
involved
in
a
billion
expansion
it
is
also
one
of
the
eu
states
that
benefit
most
from
chinese
investment
foreign
minister
peter
szijjarto
said
this
month
the
united
states
could
help
hungary
diversify
away
from
russian
energy
by
encouraging
exxonmobil
to
proceed
with
plans
to
develop
a
gas
field
in
the
black
sea
the
administration
official
said
there
had
been
progress
toward
sealing
bilateral
defence
accords
with
hungary
and
slovakia
which
is
looking
to
buy
fighter
jets
daniel
fried
a
former
ambassador
to
poland
said
engagement
with
the
region
fell
after
eu
and
nato
enlargement
to
central
europe
and
as
washington
s
attention
moved
to
asia
and
conflict
in
the
middle
east
a
lot
of
americans
thought
our
work
in
the
region
was
done
and
yet
it
was
not
so
said
fried
now
at
the
atlantic
council
in
washington
there
was
a
sense
in
the
last
administration
that
eastern
and
central
europe
was
a
finished
the
bulk
of
pompeo
s
poland
visit
will
focus
on
a
conference
on
the
future
of
peace
and
security
in
the
middle
east
vice
president
mike
pence
will
also
attend
the
event
that
starts
on
washington
hopes
to
win
support
to
increase
pressure
on
iran
to
end
what
the
it
says
is
its
malign
behaviour
in
the
middle
east
and
to
end
its
nuclear
and
missile
programmes
president
donald
trump
withdrew
from
a
deal
on
limiting
iran
s
nuclear
work
last
year
but
the
european
union
is
determined
to
stick
with
it
it
is
unclear
what
delegations
european
capitals
will
send
to
what
iranian
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
has
called
a
desperate
circus
we
think
anybody
who
doesn
t
participate
is
going
to
be
missing
out
a
second
administration
official
said
white
house
adviser
jared
kushner
trump
s
son
in
law
will
discuss
a
plan
for
peace
between
the
israelis
and
palestinians
although
he
is
not
likely
to
give
details
