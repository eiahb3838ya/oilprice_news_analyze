opec, russia draft cooperation charter offers no formal body -document
reuters
scared
by
looming
legislation
for
the
oil
industry
the
organization
for
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
allies
such
as
russia
have
decided
against
creating
a
formal
body
at
least
on
paper
a
draft
of
a
document
setting
up
a
new
alliance
and
dated
january
and
seen
by
reuters
carefully
avoids
any
mention
of
sensitive
issues
such
as
oil
prices
market
share
and
production
cuts
opec
and
russia
have
been
cutting
production
together
to
support
prices
since
after
clinching
a
deal
in
december
in
moves
that
have
provoked
criticism
from
president
donald
trump
a
committee
of
the
congress
passed
legislation
known
as
the
no
oil
producing
and
exporting
cartels
act
or
nopec
last
week
the
draft
says
opec
and
russia
will
discuss
creating
a
mechanism
rather
than
an
organization
when
they
meet
in
april
in
vienna
calling
for
the
creation
of
an
alliance
of
oil
producing
countries
it
looks
genuine
it
s
also
been
updated
since
an
opec
source
said
without
giving
any
further
details
russia
s
energy
ministry
declined
to
comment
the
objectives
of
the
alliance
are
listed
as
setting
up
an
intergovernmental
platform
to
facilitate
dialogue
and
further
strengthen
the
collaboration
in
the
formulation
of
policies
aimed
at
promoting
oil
market
stability
the
objectives
are
due
to
be
achieved
by
promoting
a
better
understanding
among
its
members
of
energy
market
fundamentals
as
well
as
permanent
dialogue
among
oil
producing
countries
according
to
the
document
russia
is
not
an
opec
member
and
has
said
it
does
intend
to
join
the
organization
on
a
permanent
basis
opec
and
russia
jointly
produce
more
than
percent
of
the
world
s
oil
the
idea
of
an
organization
of
opec
and
countries
has
been
mooted
since
joint
efforts
to
stabilize
oil
prices
have
come
to
fruition
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
in
december
a
joint
opec
and
structure
seemed
unlikely
due
the
additional
red
tape
it
would
create
as
well
as
the
risk
of
sanctions
the
draft
document
also
foresees
ministerial
meetings
twice
a
year
and
regular
encounters
of
technical
experts
