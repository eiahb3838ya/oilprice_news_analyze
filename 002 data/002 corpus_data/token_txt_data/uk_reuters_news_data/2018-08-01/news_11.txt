plastic
used
in
everyday
objects
from
bottles
to
packaging
emit
greenhouse
gases
when
exposed
to
sunlight
according
to
a
study
released
on
wednesday
as
global
concern
about
its
impact
on
the
world
s
oceans
grows
plastic
pollution
has
come
under
increased
scrutiny
from
environmentalists
as
the
scale
of
the
problem
has
become
clear
this
year
it
emerged
that
a
giant
island
made
up
of
plastic
waste
in
the
pacific
ocean
was
far
larger
than
thought
now
scientists
have
discovered
that
commonly
used
plastics
also
generate
the
potent
greenhouse
gas
methane
as
well
as
ethylene
as
they
age
adding
to
the
global
tally
of
emissions
the
study
published
in
the
journal
plos
one
said
plastics
were
likely
to
be
an
insignificant
component
of
the
global
methane
budget
due
to
the
low
quantities
produced
in
this
way
nonetheless
jonathan
nichols
an
associate
professor
of
earth
sciences
at
columbia
university
in
new
york
said
the
finding
was
definitely
important
you
can
t
solve
the
greenhouse
gas
problem
until
you
ve
defined
every
part
of
it
he
told
the

methane
emissions
mainly
caused
by
burning
fossil
fuels
are
a
major
driver
of
global
warming
putting
them
in
the
crosshairs
of
the
global
fight
against
climate
change
jennifer
provencher
a
plastic
pollution
researcher
at
acadia
university
in
canada
said
the
results
pointed
to
another
piece
of
evidence
suggesting
that
losing
plastic
to
the
environment
is
not
good
more
than
nine
billion
tons
of
plastic
has
been
produced
since
with
most
of
it
discarded
in
landfills
or
the
environment
previous
research
has
found
scientists
have
repeatedly
linked
exposure
to
some
plastic
chemicals
such
as
bisphenol
a
bpa
to
health
risks
the
garbage
patch
of
plastic
floating
in
the
pacific
holds
as
much
as
times
more
debris
than
was
previously
thought
posing
a
significant
threat
to
the
food
chain
