"bag rage" prompts backdown on plastic bag levy in australia
sydney
reuters
australia
s
supermarket
coles
on
wednesday
halted
plans
to
charge
shoppers
for
plastic
bags
succumbing
to
customer
fury
about
a
shift
away
from
plastics
coles
owned
by
wesfarmers
and
its
larger
rival
woolworths
group
ltd
removed
plastic
bags
from
stores
late
in
june
as
part
of
a
national
push
to
reduce
waste
selling
reusable
ones
for
a
small
fee
instead
it
drew
a
furious
response
dubbed
bag
rage
as
customers
angry
about
having
to
bring
their
own
sacks
or
pay
australian
cents
cents
for
a
reusable
plastic
bag
abused
checkout
staff
and
vented
on
social
media
the
union
representing
store
workers
launched
a
public
campaign
on
the
issue
and
both
grocers
capitulated
temporarily
waiving
the
fee
coles
which
had
initially
planned
to
reintroduce
the
fee
on
july
never
levied
it
and
has
now
extended
the
waiver
indefinitely
some
customers
told
us
they
needed
more
time
to
make
the
transition
to
reusable
bags
the
company
said
in
a
statement
many
customers
bringing
bags
from
home
are
still
finding
themselves
short
a
bag
or
two
so
we
are
offering
complimentary
reusable
bags
to
help
them
complete
their
shopping
it
said
the
waiver
was
still
intended
to
be
an
interim
measure
coles
said
but
gave
no
date
for
the
resumption
of
the
fee
saying
only
it
will
assess
when
customers
have
become
accustomed
to
bringing
their
own
woolworths
has
levied
per
bag
since
july
the
backflip
comes
while
coles
is
under
immense
pressure
to
lure
customers
as
its
sales
growth
lags
woolworths
just
as
wesfarmers
prepares
to
spin
it
out
and
list
it
separately
it
s
all
a
part
of
lifting
their
customer
satisfaction
and
getting
more
customers
in
the
door
said
james
tao
a
market
analyst
at
stockbroker
commonwealth
securities
in
sydney
the
cost
of
the
move
would
probably
have
a
negligible
financial
impact
he
added
it
s
more
about
the
pr
however
that
also
appeared
to
backfire
as
coles
was
lampooned
online
coles
colossal
plastic
bag
fail
and
coles
caves
ran
headlines
on
australia
s
main
news
sites
major
retailers
in
all
but
two
australian
states
face
fines
if
they
supply
plastic
bags
the
wants
to
eliminate
plastic
by
and
says
more
than
countries
have
so
far
taken
steps
to
ban
or
reduce
plastic
consumption
