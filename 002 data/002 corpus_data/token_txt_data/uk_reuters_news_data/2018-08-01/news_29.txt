opec
and
agreement
to
boost

it
is
clear
today
based
on
the
current
level
of

that
we
are
approaching
a
very
stable
stage
whether
for
the

or
the

kuwait
has
raised
its

among
the

oil
supply
levels
after
opec
and
others
led
by

agreed
in

to
raise
output
to
cool
the
market
the
minister
said
opec
and
said
they
would
raise
supply
by
returning
to
percent
compliance
with
previously
agreed
output
cuts
after
months
of
underproduction
that
would
mean
a
roughly
million
bpd
increase
in
output
last
month
brent
crude
prices
fell
more
than
percent
and
crude
slumped
about
percent
the
biggest
monthly
declines
for
both
benchmarks
since
july
rashidi
said
he
hoped
oil
production
from
the
neutral
zone
which
kuwait
shares
with
saudi
arabia
would
resume
very
soon
the
neutral
zone
is
the
only
place
in
saudi
arabia
and
kuwait
where
foreign
oil
firms
have
equity
in
oilfields
which
are
otherwise
owned
and
operated
by
state
oil
companies
crude
output
in
the
zone
is
divided
equally
between
the
two
countries
the
joint
khafji
oilfield
was
shut
in
october
for
environmental
reasons
while
the
wafra
oilfield
has
been
shut
since
may
due
to
operating
difficulties
