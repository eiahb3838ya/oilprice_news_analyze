mexico
city
s
first
woman
mayor
plans
to
significantly
improve
air
quality
in
the
smoggy
capital
one
of
the
world
s
largest
cities
by
consulting
with
car
manufacturers
on
a
plan
for
stricter
emissions
standards
she
said
in
an
interview
environmental
scientist
claudia
sheinbaum
who
won
the
election
with
a
large
margin
and
takes
office
in
december
said
a
top
priority
was
to
reduce
particulate
contamination
by
percent
in
her
six
year
term
the
city
of
some
million
people
known
for
its
deathly
smog
in
the
made
strides
towards
cleaner
air
at
the
turn
of
the
century
with
measures
that
restricted
the
use
of
older
vehicles
and
moved
major
industry
out
of
town
while
its
air
remains
far
better
than
asian
capitals
such
as
delhi
india
in
the
city
government
issued
for
the
first
time
in
years
an
air
quality
contingency
warning
a
measure
taken
when
pollution
reaches
levels
that
seriously
threaten
health
the
number
of
vehicles
in
mexico
almost
doubled
between
and
and
autos
are
now
the
leading
source
of
nitrogen
oxide
pollution
in
the
metropolitan
area
sheinbaum
said
part
of
the
problem
was
that
mexico
had
fallen
behind
in
emissions
standards
for
new
vehicles
as
well
as
needing
to
find
ways
to
bring
down
costs
for
hybrid
and
electric
vehicles
that
are
currently
out
of
reach
of
most
consumers
what
we
are
proposing
and
we
want
to
do
this
even
before
we
enter
government
is
to
have
a
meeting
with
the
major
automakers
sheinbaum
told
reuters
in
an
interview
saying
she
would
approach
embassies
of
major
automaking
powers
first
from
there
we
want
to
generate
a
new
standard
for
new
vehicles
that
allows
new
vehicles
to
be
less
and
less
polluting
she
said
sheinbaum
aims
to
pass
her
proposal
through
the
national
congress
before
it
becomes
law
a
task
made
easier
because
her
morena
party
won
a
majority
there
in
the
july
election
however
attempts
to
make
automobile
regulation
stricter
in
mexico
have
run
into
opposition
in
the
past
toyota
and
mexico
s
auto
industry
sued
the
mexican
government
in
to
try
to
block
proposed
regulations
to
align
the
fuel
efficiency
standard
of
cars
and
light
trucks
with
that
of
the
united
states
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
business
chambers
representing
mexico
s
auto
industry
and
car
dealers
did
not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for
comment
sheinbaum
who
worked
for
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
that
won
the
nobel
peace
prize
in
and
investigated
emissions
at
lawrence
berkeley
national
laboratory
said
she
wanted
to
work
in
collaboration
with
the
car
companies
to
make
the
city
what
she
called
a
global
center
of
innovation
for
public
and
private
we
want
to
have
a
workshop
with
them
to
explain
what
our
needs
are
as
a
city
to
see
their
response
and
to
see
what
they
can
sheinbaum
s
other
plans
to
clean
up
the
city
include
new
investment
in
the
metro
system
cleaner
buses
and
a
cable
car
system
to
transport
people
from
hillside
shanty
towns
similar
to
one
in
operation
in
medellin
colombia
we
want
to
bring
them
a
modern
form
of
transport
