most
asian
shares
crept
higher
on
wednesday
following
a
firm
wall
street
finish
but
gains
were
curbed
by
weak
data
in
the
region
and
intensifying
fears
over
volatile
trade
relations
global
markets
had
inched
higher
on
tuesday
helped
by
a
bloomberg
report
that
the
united
states
and
china
were
seeking
to
resume
trade
talks
to
defuse
a
battle
over
import
tariffs

reports
that
the
plans
tariffs
of
percent
on
billion
in
chinese
imports
injected
some
uncertainty
back
into
financial
markets
with
the

yuan
and
the

dollar
lower
and
china
shares
down
a
source
told

that
an
announcement
on
washington
s
tariff
plans
for
china
could
come
as
early
as
wednesday
the
seemingly
contradictory
signals
on
trade
are
puzzling
for
investors
said
ryan
felsman
senior
economist
at
commsec
in
sydney
it
s
a
little
bit
confusing
but
really
i
think
markets
are
focused
more
broadly
on
the
earnings
season
that
s
going
on
in
the
and
also
australia
is
about
to
begin
its
corporate
earnings
season

the

but
shares
in
mainland
china
dropped
erasing
early
gains
with
trade
war
fears
and
newly
released
manufacturing
data
pointing
to
a
cloudy
economic
outlook

on
wednesday
policy
meetings
of
the
federal
reserve
on
wednesday
and
the
bank
of
england
on
thursday
will
also
keep
some
investors
on
the
sidelines
although
the
central
bank
is
expected
to
keep
rates
unchanged
while

are
widely
expected
to
be
held
investors
are
more
likely
to
be
concerned
with
any
potential
tweaks
in
the
language
of
the
policy
statement
buying
sentiment
towards
the
dollar
could
receive
a
boost
if

strikes
a
hawkish
tone
