and
hard
to
comprehend
vw
has
suspended
stadler
head
of
vw
s
most
profitable
brand
after
german
authorities
arrested
him
as
part
of
an
emissions
probe
it
was
a
massive
shock
for
me
the
arrest
of
a
ceo
of
a
major
car
brand
that
s
never
happened
before
diess
told
germany
newspaper
bild
am
sonntag
the
arrest
is
hard
to
comprehend
i
knew
rupert
stadler
as
a
problem
solver
the
newspaper
quoted
him
as
saying
diess
said
that
for
him
diess
was
innocent
until
proven
guilty
stadler
who
has
not
made
any
public
comment
has
not
been
charged
and
prosecutors
are
set
to
continue
questioning
him
next
week
asked
whether
he
could
imagine
stadler
returning
diess
said
it
depended
on
what
facts
emerge
should
the
accusations
of
the
state
prosecutors
prove
to
be
true
then
it
s
a
clear
he
said
that
he
did
not
believe
audi
would
suffer
immediately
from
the
departure
of
its
ceo
but
if
it
lasts
too
long
then
it
does
become
a
problem
however
i
am
convinced
that
we
will
get
through
