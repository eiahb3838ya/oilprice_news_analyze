oil
fell
below
a
barrel
on
wednesday
after
a
report
showed
a
rise
in
crude
inventories
while
concerns
about
the
impact
on
global
supplies
of
sanctions
on
venezuela
faded
crude
inventories
rose
by
million
barrels
last
week
according
to
industry
group
the
american
petroleum
institute
and
gasoline
stocks
also
increased
the
government
s
official
supply
report
due
later
on
wednesday
the
fact
that
crude
oil
and
gasoline
stocks
rose
more
sharply
than
expected
as
reported
by
the
api
after
close
of
trading
yesterday
is
weighing
on
prices
said

analyst

brent
crude
the
global
benchmark
slipped
cents
to
a
barrel
as
of
gmt
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
was
down
cents
at
the
announced
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
state
oil
company
last
week
a
move
which
could
further
curb
supplies
although
the
development
has
yet
to
result
in
steep
price
gains
it
would
seem
that
the
market
is
really
not
too
worried
yet
about
the
potential
loss
of
venezuelan
barrels
said
analysts
at
jbc
energy
in
a
report
this
is
either
because
the
market
assumes
that
the
size
of
the
impact
will
not
be
large
or
at
least
it
will
be
of
short
enough
worries
about
weaker
global
economic
growth
and
the
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
have
also
weighed
on
the
market
oil
fell
on
tuesday
after
a
survey
showed
euro
zone
business
expansion
nearly
stalled
in
january
in
his
state
of
the
union
address
president
donald
trump
said
a
trade
deal
was
possible
with
china
senior
and
chinese
officials
are
poised
to
start
another
round
of
trade
talks
next
week
supply
cuts
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
allies
including
russia
have
been
supporting
prices
venezuela
an
opec
member
is
like
iran
and
libya
exempt
from
making
voluntary
curbs
under
the
deal
the
producers
known
as
began
cutting
production
from
last
month
to
avert
a
new
supply
glut
and
opec
has
delivered
almost
of
its
pledged
cutback
already
according
to
a
reuters
survey
fritsch
of
commerzbank
said
the
venezuelan
issue
could
still
drive
oil
higher
the
price
has
yet
to
react
in
any
noticeable
way
he
said
that
said
if
the
other
opec
countries
fail
to
offset
this
outage
the
oil
market
could
quickly
become
undersupplied
driving
the
price
