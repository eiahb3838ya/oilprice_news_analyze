update 10-trump vows to build border wall, warns democrats against investigations
washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
vowed
in
his
state
of
the
union
speech
on
tuesday
to
build
a
border
wall
which
is
a
source
of
a
deep
partisan
divide
and
said
democratic
attempts
at
ridiculous
partisan
investigations
could
damage
prosperity
trump
spoke
to
a
joint
session
of
the
congress
facing
political
discord
over
his
demands
that
democrats
end
their
opposition
to
funding
for
a
border
wall
he
says
is
needed
to
stem
illegal
immigration
and
smuggled
drugs
during
his
speech
he
outlined
his
political
priorities
without
providing
specific
policy
details
trump
called
illegal
immigration
an
urgent
national
crisis
but
stopped
short
of
declaring
a
border
emergency
that
would
allow
him
to
bypass
congress
for
wall
funding
instead
he
urged
democrats
and
republicans
to
find
a
compromise
by
a
deadline
in
the
past
most
of
the
people
in
this
room
voted
for
a
wall
but
the
proper
wall
never
got
built
i
will
get
it
built
trump
said
in
the
house
of
representatives
chamber
with
his
main
democratic
adversary
new
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
watching
over
his
shoulder
democrats
call
the
wall
a
waste
of
money
and
ineffective
during
the
speech
democratic
representative
pramila
jayapal
tweeted
her
opposition
to
the
wall
saying
the
border
is
more
secure
than
ever
trump
warned
without
offering
evidence
that
democratic
efforts
to
investigate
his
administration
along
with
the
possibility
of
involvement
in
wars
abroad
would
endanger
the
economy
an
economic
miracle
is
taking
place
in
the
united
states
and
the
only
thing
that
can
stop
it
are
foolish
wars
politics
or
ridiculous
partisan
investigations
he
said
his
remarks
came
as
democrats
who
now
control
the
house
planned
a
series
of
probes
into
the
trump
administration
and
his
personal
finances
while
special
prosecutor
robert
mueller
investigates
russian
meddling
in
the
presidential
election
and
possible
collusion
between
the
trump
campaign
and
moscow
russia
denies
meddling
and
trump
has
said
there
was
no
collusion
democratic
representative
val
demings
called
trump
s
remarks
shameful
and
said
the
investigations
would
proceed
we
re
not
going
to
stop
she
said
apart
from
lauding
economic
accomplishments
unemployment
near
a
low
and
manufacturing
job
growth
among
them
trump
s
speech
was
light
on
new
initiatives
to
further
stoke
growth
in
an
economy
seen
as
losing
momentum
as
it
began
financial
markets
were
largely
subdued
as
trump
delivered
his
speech
it
was
pablum
without
specifics
said
tim
ghriskey
chief
investment
strategist
at
inverness
counsel
in
new
york
trump
s
speech
unfolded
largely
in
a
civil
fashion
with
cabinet
members
military
commanders
and
several
supreme
court
justices
in
attendance
at
the
annual
presidential
address
to
congress
many
democratic
women
lawmakers
wore
white
to
celebrate
years
of
women
having
gained
the
right
to
vote
republicans
cheered
on
the
president
while
democrats
grimaced
or
shook
their
heads
but
held
their
fire
and
applauded
at
moments
such
as
when
two
holocaust
survivors
were
recognised
despite
a
lack
of
concrete
progress
in
persuading
north
korea
to
give
up
its
nuclear
weapons
programme
trump
said
his
second
summit
with
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
would
take
place
on
and
in
vietnam
it
is
expected
to
be
either
in
hanoi
or
da
nang
from
china
to
venezuela
to
afghanistan
trump
devoted
a
large
section
of
his
speech
to
foreign
policy
saying
a
trade
deal
was
possible
with
china
if
beijing
agrees
to
real
structural
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
are
in
talks
to
try
to
hammer
out
an
agreement
to
end
a
trade
war
trump
hailed
peace
efforts
unfolding
between
his
administration
and
taliban
insurgents
in
afghanistan
and
said
if
a
deal
could
be
reached
it
would
allow
him
to
bring
some
troops
home
after
years
of
war
spawned
by
the
attacks
as
we
make
progress
in
these
negotiations
we
will
be
able
to
reduce
our
troop
presence
and
focus
on
counterterrorism
he
said
he
also
hailed
allied
gains
against
islamic
state
militants
in
syria
and
reiterated
his
plan
to
withdraw
troops
from
that
war
zone
despite
comments
earlier
in
the
day
from
a
top
general
joseph
votel
that
a
pullout
could
prompt
a
resurgence
in
the
militancy
great
nations
do
not
fight
endless
wars
said
trump
whose
withdrawal
plans
are
opposed
by
many
congressional
republicans
trump
also
denounced
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
who
the
united
states
and
a
number
of
latin
american
and
european
countries
accuse
of
being
an
illegitimate
leader
after
last
year
s
disputed
election
trump
used
part
of
his
speech
to
offer
a
spirit
of
compromise
particularly
in
areas
such
as
lowering
the
price
of
prescription
drugs
and
funding
a
trillion
upgrade
in
roads
bridges
and
other
infrastructure
but
whether
trump
and
his
opponents
would
follow
through
was
far
from
clear
with
both
sides
entrenched
in
positions
and
girding
for
elections
reluctant
to
give
the
other
side
a
political
victory
driving
the
two
parties
apart
is
trump
s
insistence
on
funding
for
the
border
wall
pelosi
who
frequently
sat
through
trump
s
address
has
shown
no
sign
of
budging
from
her
opposition
to
trump
s
demand
the
republican
president
appeared
in
the
house
chamber
just
weeks
after
his
demand
for
billion
in
funding
for
the
wall
triggered
a
historic
partial
government
shutdown
that
more
than
half
of
americans
blamed
him
for
according
to
polling
simply
put
walls
work
and
walls
save
lives
so
let
s
work
together
compromise
and
reach
a
deal
that
will
truly
make
america
safe
trump
said
in
the
democratic
response
to
trump
s
speech
stacey
abrams
who
lost
a
race
for
governor
of
georgia
last
november
said
that
while
democrats
stood
ready
to
secure
the
country
s
ports
and
borders
america
is
made
stronger
by
the
presence
of
immigrants
not
for
all
of
trump
s
talk
about
political
unity
he
could
not
resist
denouncing
liberal
democrats
who
have
gained
power
in
the
house
best
personified
by
representative
alexandria
who
has
proposed
a
percent
tax
on
the
richest
americans
we
are
born
free
and
we
will
stay
free
tonight
we
renew
our
resolve
that
america
will
never
be
a
socialist
country
trump
said
as
trump
spoke
could
be
seen
smiling
