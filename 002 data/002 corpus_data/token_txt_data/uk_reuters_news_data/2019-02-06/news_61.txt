bottles
of
water
she
was
given
every
day
were
clogging
her
bin
with
plastic
outside
her
door
chaweng
beach
was
smothered
in
rubbish
it
was
then
that
she
and
kohler
brothers
ryan
and
matthew
had
a
moment
instead
of
trying
to
solve
the
problem
by
cleaning
the
beaches
every
day
let
s
go
to
what
the
source
of
the
problem
is
and
take
the
plastic
bottle
away
said
kerrigan
now
in
the
trio
founded
startup
company
generation
water
based
on
the
thai
resort
island
of
phuket
they
partnered
with
marriott
the
world
s
largest
hotel
brand
in
january
to
come
up
with
a
sustainable
alternative
to
plastic
bottles
that
would
be
commercially
competitive
and
meet
the
needs
of
resorts
and
authorities
two
years
on
the
south
entrepreneurs
explained
the
workings
of
a
pilot
water
plant
at
the
jw
marriott
phuket
resort
spa
on
mai
khao
beach
next
to
slogans
saying
save
water
drink
air
and
made
from
the
air
here
in
the
sweltering
heat
two
water
generators
suck
in
vapour
from
the
air
which
then
condenses
into
water
when
it
hits
cold
coils
the
water
drips
into
tanks
making
litres
a
day
it
is
filtered
minerals
are
added
and
it
is
put
into
reusable
glass
bottles
these
are
placed
into
guestrooms
at
the
jw
marriott
phuket
and
neighbouring
renaissance
phuket
resort
spa
the
bottled
water
is
also
being
trialled
at
two
marriott
vacation
clubs
nearby
the
move
is
part
of
a
wider
effort
on
the
holiday
island
to
cut
down
on
plastic
bottles
rife
in
the
hospitality
industry
and
a
major
problem
in
asia
and
its
travel
hotspots
in
many
parts
of
asia
tap
water
is
unsafe
to
drink
so
hotel
guests
get
complimentary
water
mostly
in
plastic
bottles
as
much
as
percent
of
the
plastic
found
in
the
ocean
comes
from
five
asian
nations
including
thailand
according
to
group
ocean
conservancy
in
the
united

organised
a
forum
to
encourage
sustainable
water
management
on
resort
islands
on
phuket
which
is
half
the
size
of

more
hotels
are
being
built
and

is
already
in
short
supply
trucks

crowded
roads
as
resorts
without
their

bring
in
water
from

phuket
was
the
world
s
top
city
destination
in
with
million
international
arrivals
according
to
global
research
company
euromonitor
international
to
cope
with
the
environmental
impacts
of
this
influx
nearly
hotels
from
the
phuket
hotels
association
have
pledged
to
cut
plastic
bottles
and
straws
by
the
end
of
since
marriott
started
producing
its
own
water
four
months
ago
it
has
stopped
more
than
plastic
bottles
from
entering
landfill
or
oceans
the
chain
says
it
plans
to
expand
the
scheme
to
all
marriott
resorts
in
southern

carsten
siebert
marriott
international
s
director
of
operations
for
thailand
vietnam
cambodia
and
myanmar
said
the
company
understood
it
had
a
greater
obligation
to
operate
responsibly
given
our
expanding
global
footprint
the
chain
has
a
goal
to
reduce
water
consumption
per
occupied
room
by
percent
between
and
the
water
from
air
technology
uses
percent
less
energy
than
producing
standard
bottled
water
has
a
lower
carbon
footprint
and
is
about
a
third
cheaper
generation
water
says
the
good
thing
is
that
it
starts
to
become
financially
affordable
said
matthias
sutter
general
manager
at
jw
marriott
phuket
nor
does
the
system
rely
on
pulling
water
from
the
ground
rivers
or
lakes
we
don
t
have
to
invest
in
land
to
secure
our
own
water
said
kanokwan
corporate
social
responsibility
manager
for
the
same
marriott
hotel
guests
here
have
reacted
positively
since
the
bottled
water
was
introduced
in
september
happy
that
finally
a
big
brand
made
a
move
she
said
they
also
like
the
taste
michael
lawson
a
lawyer
from
sydney
sitting
at
the
sala
sawasdee
lobby
bar
said
his
children
were
quite
picky
about
water
but
it
s
very
refreshing
and
they
are
fighting
over
it
in
the
room
he
said
downstairs
in
the
siam
deli
teenage
student
jeremy
frydman
from
melbourne
said
it
was
better
than
tap
water
at
home
one
challenge
for
generation
water
is
explaining
the
science
behind
the
technology
many
guests
ask
about
air
pollution
for
example
but
the
water
collected
is
clean
to
start
with
and
the
technology
still
works
if
the
air
is
polluted
as
only
water
condenses
not
the
air
or
its
contaminants
said
ryan
kohler
and
with
human
activities
emitting
more
greenhouse
gases
the
atmosphere
is
warming
up
causing
more
water
to
evaporate
which
further
heats
the
air
in
a
vicious
circle
he
added
the
system
helps
reduce
this
vapour
said
kerrigan
adding
that
it
has
no
impact
on
rainfall
levels
thailand
s
food
and
drug
administration
approved
generation
water
last
august
and
the
company
is
now
expanding
it
is
building
a
plant
in
phuket
which
will
use
solar
energy
to
make
water
producing
more
than
litres
of
water
per
day
by
the
end
of
the
year
nine
marriott
resorts
on
phuket
are
in
the
process
of
signing
up
along
with
other
hotels
generation
water
is
now
eyeing
the
rest
of
thailand
and
is
talking
to
hotels
in
singapore
indonesia
vietnam
and
the
maldives
kohler
said
it
also
sells
smaller
water
production
units
that
can
be
used
in
homes
offices
classrooms
and
yachts
the
company
s
goal
is
to
stop
billion
ml
plastic
bottles
from
entering
landfill
and
the
oceans
every
year
by
the
end
of
equal
to
supplying
hotels
of
rooms
as
for
marriott
staff
on
phuket
they
have
no
excuse
now
said
their
birthday
gift
from
the
company
will
be
a
reusable
tumbler
which
they
can
fill
up
with
water
from
the
air
