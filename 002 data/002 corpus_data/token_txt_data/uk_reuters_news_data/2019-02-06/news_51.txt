column-vale disaster makes miners' image problem worse: russell
cape

reuters
the
response
to
the
horrendous
dam
collapse
at
a
mine
owned
by
brazil
s
vale
has
focused
on
iron
ore
prices
and
how
a
disaster
that
will
likely
claim
more
than
lives
occurred
and
what
must
be
done
to
make
sure
this
doesn
t
happen
again
these
are
valid
concerns
but
the
risk
of
focusing
on
the
immediate
issues
is
that
the
much
larger
problems
of
the
mining
industry
are
once
again
glossed
over
namely
that
miners
aren
t
trusted
and
suffer
from
a
serious
image
problem
it
may
seem
somewhat
trivial
to
talk
about
image
in
the
face
of
such
a
human
tragedy
but
mining
s
poor
image
across
a
range
of
stakeholders
is
the
major
issue
for
the
industry
if
mining
has
a
poor
safety
and
community
image
it
becomes
uninvestable
to
use
the
words
of
a
senior
global
banker
talking
at
the
mining
investment
event
in
cape
town
this
week
held
under
chatham
house
rules
if
investors
don
t
want
to
commit
funds
to
the
industry
because
of
fear
over
damage
to
their
own
image
from
poor
mining
practices
then
the
industry
will
be
starved
of
capital
lack
of
capital
means
it
becomes
harder
and
harder
to
get
new
mines
built
or
exploration
drilling
undertaken
there
is
also
the
risk
of
a
cascade
of
negative
outcomes
for
mining
if
major
banks
and
pension
funds
make
it
clear
they
are
withdrawing
from
investing
in
mining
companies
it
s
likely
share
prices
will
suffer
leading
other
investors
to
withdraw
funds
even
if
they
don
t
have
quite
the
same
moral
qualms
it
goes
further
than
just
losing
sources
of
capital
with
mining
companies
already
struggling
to
attract
younger
workers
a
common
theme
at
the
investing
in
african
mining
indaba
a
second
event
in
cape
town
this
week
and
one
of
the
biggest
such
conferences
worldwide
was
a
lament
from
company
executives
that
members
of
the
millennial
generation
roughly
in
their
early
to
show
little
interest
in
mining
preferring
more
trendy
industries
such
as
technology
and
digital
solutions
the
fact
that
mining
is
increasingly
turning
to
digital
applications
and
that
mines
of
the
future
will
bear
little
resemblance
to
current
operations
is
not
resonating
with
younger
workers
largely
because
of
the
industry
s
image
rather
than
its
substance
mining
companies
also
have
a
global
image
problem
with
many
increasingly
nationalistic
governments
wanting
to
extract
more
value
from
their
mineral
resources
mining
companies
push
back
against
higher
royalties
or
other
forms
of
contribution
such
as
underwriting
new
infrastructure
largely
because
they
boost
costs
and
cut
profits
but
by
becoming
unpopular
in
countries
where
they
operate
longer
term
costs
may
be
ultimately
higher
for
mining
companies
mining
runs
the
risk
of
suffering
what
happened
to
the
oil
industry
where
international
majors
went
from
a
dominant
position
to
one
where
state
companies
produce
the
bulk
of
crude
the
mining
industry
appears
to
be
increasingly
aware
of
its
image
problem
with
speakers
at
both
the
mining
and
mining
indaba
events
referring
repeatedly
to
the
concept
of
their
licence
to
operate
a
term
that
includes
working
with
local
communities
governments
and
consumers
of
their
products
miners
are
keen
to
brand
themselves
as
part
of
the
green
energy
revolution
since
mining
provides
the
metals
and
energy
needed
to
make
the
renewable
technologies
that
aim
to
replace
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels
but
the
problem
for
miners
is
convincing
an
increasingly
sceptical
public
of
how
necessary
their
industry
is
part
of
this
is
that
the
greener
part
of
mining
is
still
struggling
to
disassociate
itself
from
the
dirty
part
in
other
words
lithium
cobalt
and
copper
miners
still
get
lumped
alongside
coal
miners
iron
ore
miners
now
are
at
risk
of
moving
into
the
space
occupied
by
coal
as
public
distrust
and
distaste
will
be
ramped
up
after
the
tailings
dam
collapse
at
vale
s
corrego
do
feijao
mine
the
industry
needs
to
do
more
than
just
recognise
its
image
problems
it
needs
chief
executives
to
make
presenting
and
promoting
a
better
picture
their
top
priority
not
just
something
they
pay
lip
service
to
before
handing
off
to
junior
public
relations
teams

opinions
