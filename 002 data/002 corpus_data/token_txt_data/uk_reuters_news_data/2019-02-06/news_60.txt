insight-bet everything on electric: inside vw's radical strategy shift
wolfsburg

if
volkswagen
realizes
its
ambition
of
becoming
the
global
leader
in
electric
cars
it
will
be
thanks
to
a
radical
and
risky
bet
born
out
of
the
biggest
calamity
in
its
history
the
german
giant
has
staked
its
future
to
the
tune
of
billion
euros
billion
on
being
able
to
profitably
electric
vehicles
a
feat
no
carmaker
has
come
close
to
achieving
so
far
mainstream
automakers
electric
plans
have
had
one
main
goal
to
protect
profits
gleaned
from
conventional
cars
by
adding
enough
vehicles
to
their
fleet
to
meet
rules
customers
have
meanwhile
largely
shunned
electric
vehicles
because
they
are
too
expensive
can
be
inconvenient
to
charge
and
lack
range
the
biggest
strategy
shift
in
volkswagen
s
years
has
its
roots
in
a
weekend
crisis
meeting
at
the
rothehof
guesthouse
in
wolfsburg
on
october
senior
executives
told
reuters
at
the
meeting
hosted
by
then
vw
brand
chief
herbert
diess
nine
top
managers
gathered
on
a
cloudy
saturday
afternoon
to
discuss
the
way
forward
after
regulators
blew
the
whistle
on
the
company
s
emissions
cheating
a
scandal
that
cost
it
more
than
billion
euros
in
fines
and
tainted
its
name
it
was
an
intense
discussion
so
was
the
realization
that
this
could
be
an
opportunity
if
we
jump
far
enough
said
juergen
stackmann
vw
brand
s
board
member
for
sales
it
was
an
initial
planning
session
to
do
more
than
just
play
with
the
idea
of
electric
cars
he
told
reuters
we
asked
ourselves
what
is
our
vision
for
the
future
of
the
brand
everything
that
you
see
today
is
connected
to
just
three
days
after
the
rothehof
meeting
of
the
vw
brand
s
management
board
volkswagen
announced
plans
to
develop
an
electric
vehicle
platform
codenamed
meb
paving
the
way
for
mass
production
of
an
affordable
electric
car
for
months
after
the
volkswagen
scandal
blew
up
in
rival
carmakers
treated
as
a
vw
issue
according
to
industry
experts
but
regulators
have
since
uncovered
excessive
emissions
across
the
sector
and
unleashed
a
clampdown
that
undermines
the
business
case
for
combustion
engines
forcing
a
rethink
now
the
villain
of
dieselgate
is
likely
to
become
the
largest
producer
of
electric
cars
in
the
world
in
coming
years
analysts
say
putting
it
in
pole
position
to
flood
the
market
should
the
demand
materialize
decisions
to
convert
the
emden
factory
in
lower
saxony
to
build
electric
cars
would
never
have
happened
without
this
saturday
meeting
said
stackmann
one
of
five
senior
vw
executives
who
spoke
to
reuters
however
the
full
scale
of
vw
s
ambitions
were
only
revealed
two
months
ago
when
it
took
the
industry
by
surprise
by
pledging
to
spend
billion
euros
to
develop
electric
vehicles
and
buy
batteries
dwarfing
the
investment
of
rivals
it
plans
to
raise
annual
production
of
electric
cars
to
million
by
from
in
it
s
a
risky
bet
with
regulators
and
lawmakers
rather
than
customers
dictating
what
kind
of
vehicles
can
hit
the
road
analysts
at
deloitte
say
the
industry
could
produce
million
electric
cars
for
which
there
is
no
consumer
demand
it
s
also
an
bet
in
the
long
run
vw
whose
id
electric
car
will
hit
showrooms
in
has
set
a
deadline
for
ending
mass
production
of
combustion
engines
the
final
generation
of
gasoline
and
diesel
engines
will
be
developed
by
arndt
ellinghorst
analyst
at
evercore
isi
said
betting
on
electric
vehicles
evs
could
be
risky
because
customers
did
not
want
to
own
cars
dependent
on
facilities
what
if
people
are
still
not
ready
to
own
evs
will
adoption
be
the
same
in
the
europe
and
china
he
said
but
he
added
that
eu
and
chinese
emissions
regulations
made
electric
vehicle
adoption
inevitable
and
that
being
an
early
industry
mover
in
that
direction
offered
a
positive
another
of
dieselgate
that
quickened
vw
s
electric
drive
according
to
the
senior
executives
was
a
purge
of
the
company
s
old
guard
who
became
the
focus
of
public
and
political
anger
this
empowered
diess
a
newcomer
who
had
joined
as
vw
brand
boss
shortly
before
regulators
exposed
the
carmaker
s
emission
test
cheating
diess
who
joined
from
bmw
where
he
helped
pioneer
a
electric
vehicle
has
since
been
appointed
ceo
of
volkswagen
group
a
empire
that
includes
audi
porsche
bentley
seat
skoda
lamborghini
and
ducati
carmakers
have
failed
to
electric
cars
profitably
largely
because
of
the
prohibitive
cost
of
battery
packs
which
make
up
between
percent
and
percent
of
the
cost
of
an
electric
vehicle
a

costs
around
compared
with
a

that

we

volkswagen
a

people
for

we
need
economies
of

and
vw
more
than
any
other
carmaker
can
take
advantage
of
this
a
senior
volkswagen
executive
told
reuters
declining
to
be
named
the
carmaker
s
budget
outstrips
that
of
its
closest
competitor
germany
s

has
committed

the
automaker
has
said
it
plans
to
spend
a
combined
billion
on
electric
and

said
in
late
they
would
spend
billion
euros
by
on
developing
electric
and
autonomous
cars
on
a
view
we
expect
volkswagen
to
be
the
number
one

producer
globally
ubs

said
tesla
is
likely
to
remain
a
niche
vw
s
test
cheating
using
engine
management
software
defeat
devices
resulted
in
the
introduction
of
tougher
pollution
tests
which
revealed
in
and
that
emissions
readings
across
the
industry
were
up
to
percent
higher
under
driving
conditions
compared
with
lab
conditions
this
has
raised
the
bar
on
the
auto
sector
s
efforts
to
cut
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
blamed
for
causing
global
warming
eu
lawmakers
in
december
agreed
a
cut
in
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
cars
of
percent
by
compared
with
levels
this
was
after
the
european
union
forced
a

cut
in

between

this
goal
is
no
longer
reachable

ford

mazda

while

to

for

carmakers
have
struggled
to
lower
their

emissions
because
of
a
shift
in
customer
taste
toward
heavier
bigger
suvs
sports
utility
vehicles
which
make
it
harder
to
maintain
the
same
levels
of

and
comfort
without
increasing

suvs
are
now
the
most
popular
vehicle
category
in

commanding
a
market
share
of
percent
according
to
jato
dynamics
even
porsche
which
makes
lightweight
sportscars
relies
on
sports
utility
vehicles
for
percent
of

as
the
scale
of
excessive
emissions
prompted
brussels
to
push
through
tougher
laws
late
last
year
vw
executives
concluded
that
purely
electric
cars
were
the
most
efficient
way
to
meet
carbon
dioxide
goals
across
its
fleet
this
was
the
point
of
no
return
according
to
executives
when
the
company
made
the
final
electric
investment
decisions
and
committed
to
staying
the
course
it
had
plotted
after
