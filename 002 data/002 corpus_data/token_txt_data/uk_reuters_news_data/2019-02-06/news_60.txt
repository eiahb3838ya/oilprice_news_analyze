and
their

below
are
excerpts
from
his
speech
as
prepared
for
delivery
the
agenda
i
will
lay
out
this
evening
is
not
a
republican
agenda
or
a
democrat
agenda
it
is
the
agenda
of
the
american
in
the
century
america
saved
freedom
transformed
science
and
redefined
the
middle
class
standard
of
living
for
the
entire
world
to
see
now
we
must
step
boldly
and
bravely
into
the
next
chapter
of
this
great
american
adventure
and
we
must
create
a
new
standard
of
living
for
the
together
we
can
break
decades
of
political
stalemate
we
can
bridge
old
divisions
heal
old
wounds
build
new
coalitions
forge
new
solutions
and
unlock
the
extraordinary
promise
of
america
s
future
the
decision
is
ours
to
over
the
last
two
years
my
administration
has
moved
with
urgency
and
historic
speed
to
confront
problems
neglected
by
leaders
of
both
parties
over
many
we
have
unleashed
a
revolution
in
american
energy
the
united
states
is
now
the
number
one
producer
of
oil
and
natural
gas
in
the
after
months
of
rapid
progress
our
economy
is
the
envy
of
the
world
our
military
is
the
most
powerful
on
earth
and
america
is
winning
each
and
every
last
year
i
heard
through
friends
the
story
of
alice
johnson
i
was
deeply
moved
in
alice
was
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
as
a
drug
offender
over
the
next
two
decades
she
became
a
prison
minister
inspiring
others
to
choose
a
better
path
alice
s
story
underscores
the
disparities
and
unfairness
that
can
exist
in
criminal
sentencing
and
the
need
to
remedy
this
we
have
a
moral
duty
to
create
an
immigration
system
that
protects
the
lives
and
jobs
of
our
no
issue
better
illustrates
the
divide
between
america
s
working
class
and
america
s
political
class
than
illegal
immigration
wealthy
politicians
and
donors
push
for
open
borders
while
living
their
lives
behind
walls
and
gates
and
all
americans
can
be
proud
that
we
have
more
women
in
the
workforce
than
ever
to
build
on
our
incredible
economic
success
one
priority
is
paramount
reversing
decades
of
calamitous
trade
both
parties
should
be
able
to
unite
for
a
great
rebuilding
of
america
s
crumbling
it
is
unacceptable
that
americans
pay
vastly
more
than
people
in
other
countries
for
the
exact
same
drugs
often
made
in
the
exact
same
place
this
is
wrong
unfair
and
together
we
can
stop
we
stand
with
the
venezuelan
people
in
their
noble
quest
for
as
a
candidate
for
president
i
pledged
a
new
approach
great
nations
do
not
fight
endless
we
will
not
avert
our
eyes
from
a
regime
that
chants
death
to
america
and
threatens
genocide
