one
of
canada
s
biggest
oil
producers
expects
the
province
of
alberta
to
end
mandatory
production
curtailments
ahead
of
schedule
as
they
have
caused
a
price
boost
that
makes
rail
shipments
uneconomic
chief
executive
officer
steve
williams
said
on
wednesday
such
unintended
consequences
are
happening
faster
than
the
alberta
government
likely
expected
and
it
should
now
plan
for
a
soft
exit
from
curtailments
that
is
fair
to
producers
williams
said
on
a
quarterly
conference
call
the
rail
economics
are
seriously
damaged
and
a
lot
of
the
rail
movements
are
stopping
or
have
stopped
he
said
that
s
going
to
have
the
opposite
impact
than
what
the
government
alberta
curtailed
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
january
to
drain
a
glut
of
crude
in
storage
that
was
caused
by
congested
pipelines
the
output
cuts
boosted
canadian
oil
prices
from
record
lows
last
year
but
suncor
and
other
producers
that
have
ample
pipeline
space
and
refineries
say
the
sharp
correction
harmed
their
integrated
businesses
the
curtailments
were
applied
fairly
and
saved
jobs
in
the
sector
said
mike
mckinnon
spokesman
for
alberta
s
energy
minister
he
said
the
government
will
monitor
storage
levels
and
adjust
production
levels
as
needed
williams
said
that
the
case
for
forced
curtailments
is
likely
to
abate
with
seasonal
maintenance
shutdowns
by
oil
producers
during
the
second
quarter
and
with
enbridge
inc
s
line
expansion
likely
to
start
filling
for
later
this
year
you
re
going
to
see
the
pressure
start
to
come
off
he
said
suncor
s
shares
turned
positive
after
williams
remarks
and
were
up
percent
at
c
on
wednesday
afternoon
in
toronto
alberta
eased
the
curtailments
modestly
for
february
and
march
its
plan
is
to
reduce
the
curtailments
further
to
an
average
of
bpd
through
the
end
of
once
storage
levels
are
sufficiently
reduced
suncor
s
comments
echo
those
of
rival
imperial
oil
ltd
which
said
last
week
that
it
is
ending
nearly
all
crude
by
rail
shipments
because
of
the
price
impact
of
the
curtailments
late
on
tuesday
suncor
reported
a
