minister
bruno
le
maire
told
the
senate
that
if
engie
wanted
to
issue
new
capital
to
finance
its
expansion
the
state
would
have
no
choice
but
to
subscribe
to
respect
the
law
that
is
why
we
ask
for
the
possibility
to
lower
the
state
s
stake
in
engie
below
the
legal
limit
le
maire
told
senators
the
government
has
given
no
indication
of
how
much
of
its
shares
it
may
want
to
sell

opposition
voted
against

of
the

proposal
a
could
only
have
delayed
the
operation
rather
than
definitively
block
it
since
the
assemblee
nationale
lower
house
of
parliament
where
president
emmanuel
macron
s
centrist
lrem
party
has
a
comfortable
majority
has
the
final
vote
the
logic
is
the
same
for
all
government
asset
sales
we
want
to
give
these
companies
the
chance
to
grow
and
develop
le
maire
said
adding
that
engie
would
boost
its
investment
in
renewable
energy
notably
biogas
and
offshore
wind
power
the
planned
sale
of
more
engie
shares
is
part
