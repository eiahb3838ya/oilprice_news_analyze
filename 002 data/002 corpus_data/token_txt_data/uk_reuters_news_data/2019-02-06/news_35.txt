seminary
turkey
which
is
overwhelmingly
muslim
has
given
no
public
indication
that
it
is

a
matter
for

countries
had
agreed
to
tensions
in
the

wednesday
in
istanbul
on
a
tour
of
hagia
sophia
which
was
the
foremost
cathedral
in
christendom
for
years
and
then
after
the
city
fell
to
the
ottoman
turks
in
one
of
islam
s
greatest
mosques
for
another
years
it
has
been
a
museum
since
in
late
erdogan
made
the
first
visit
to
greece
by
a
turkish
president
in
years
but
the
trip
was
marred
by
verbal
sparring
over
various
historical
grievances
erdogan
complained
about
discrimination
against
muslims
in
northern
greece
while
turkey
s
military
presence
in
ethnically
split
cyprus
and
diverging
interpretations
of
an
international
treaty
defining
their
borders
also
fueled
tensions
cyprus
has
been
divided
since
a
turkish
invasion
in
triggered
by
a
brief
coup
peace
talks
between
the
greek
and
turkish
sides
collapsed
in
nato
members
greece
and
turkey
were
nearly
drawn
into
a
military
clash

an
uninhabited
aegean
islet

updated
a
list
of
former
military
officers
wanted

role
in
the

officers
granted
asylum
in
greece

offered
a
bounty
of
million
turkish
lira
for
each
of
them
