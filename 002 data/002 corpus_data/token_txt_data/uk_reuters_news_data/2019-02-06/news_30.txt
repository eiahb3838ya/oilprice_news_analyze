russia
s
gazprom
is
looking
to
gain
an
even
larger
gas
market
share
in
europe
following
exports
expecting
a
decline
in
europe
s
gas
output
combined
with
rising
demand
a
senior
manager
at
the
company
said
last
year
it
sold
more
than
billion
cubic
metres
of
gas
to
europe
including
turkey
while
its
gas
market
share
in
the
region
rose
to
more
than
a
third
elena
burmistrova
in
charge
of
the
russian
company
s
exports
said
gazprom
would
be
able
to
offset
a
production
decline
in
the
european
union
mainly
at
the
netherlands
groningen
once
europe
s
largest
natural
gas
field
north
sea
production
is
also
gradually
declining
so
the
space
for
russian
gas
is
being
freed
up
she
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
european
gas
conference
in
vienna
eu

halve

has
said
moscow
has
piped
gas
to
europe
from
its
fields
in
siberia
and
northern
russia
for
more
than
years
it
can
ill
afford
losing
the
lucrative
market
for
gazprom
whose
sales
account
for
over
percent
of
russia
s
trillion
economy
burmistrova
said
gazprom
was
striving
to
raise
its
market
share
in
europe
where
the
company
generates
two
thirds
of
its
gas
sales
according
to
preliminary
estimates
our
share
in
europe
stood
at
percent
in
while
in
it
could
have
reached
around
percent
burmistrova
said
in
remarks
cleared
for
publication
on
wednesday
russian
energy
sales
have
become
increasingly
politicised
since
following
the
annexation
of
the
crimean
peninsula
from
ukraine
accusations
of
meddling
in
the
presidential
election
in
and
a
nerve
gas
attack
in
britain
gazprom
last
year
escaped
the
spectre
of
big
fines
in
a
case
that
had
dragged
on
for
seven
years
after
it
clinched
a
deal
with
eu
antitrust
regulators
to
reform
its
pricing
structure
and
allow
rivals
a
foothold
in
eastern
europe
burmistrova
said
gazprom
did
not
want
to
look
too
aggressive
in
the
eyes
of
europe
with
its
plans
to
boost
sales
we
don
t
set
a
target
of
gaining
or
percent
of
the
eu
market
she
said
some
european
countries
mainly
in
eastern
europe
have
voiced
concern
about
russia
s
growing
energy
clout
the
gazprom
manager
said
the
company
had
proven
to
be
a
reliable
gas
supplier
and
that
its
exports
in
europe
would
not
suffer
because
of
politics
however
gazprom
s
exports
have
been
jeopardised
by
a
shale
gas
production
boom
in
the
united
states
and
president
donald
trump
s
plans
to
sell
vast
amounts
of
liquefied
natural

to
europe
lng

to

totalled
million
tonnes

in
october
to
january
compared
to
million

or
nine

a
year
earlier
the

down
the

to
