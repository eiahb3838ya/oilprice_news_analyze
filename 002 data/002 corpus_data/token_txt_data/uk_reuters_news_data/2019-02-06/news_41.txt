the

seem
to
break
a
deadlock

a
percent
stake
in
uniper
from
last
year
in
a
deal

as
hostile
by

it
had
raised
its
stake
to
percent
the

could
add
value
this
revives
takeover
speculation
a
management
could
pave
the
way
for
a
complete
takeover
and
should
try
to
find
a
solution
for
the
current
russian
blockade
said
a
trader
jp
morgan
analysts
were
more
cautious
we
would
caution
investors
who
may
think
that
this
is
a
sign
of
fortum
getting
close
to
reaching
domination
agreement
any
sooner
they
said

working
out
a

his
illness
sources
told

that
fortum
held
talks
with

fund
elliott
uniper
s
shareholder
with
a
percent
stake
over
how
to
gain
control
of
the
german
firm
elliott
may
raise
its
stake
further
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
said
a
move
that
would
make
it
harder
for
fortum
to
gain
full
control
without
paying
up
it
is
in
the
interest
of
everybody
that
we
rapidly
advance
now
to
create
value
for
the
stakeholders
of
both
companies
