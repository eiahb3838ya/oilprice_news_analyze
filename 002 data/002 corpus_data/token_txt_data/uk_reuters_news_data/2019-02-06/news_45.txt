column-u.s.-china talks dominate oil outlook: kemp
london
reuters
the
deadline
for
the
united
states
and
china
to
reach
a
trade
deal
before
tariffs
increase
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
scheduled
for
march
is
the
most
important
date
in
the
calendar
for
oil
traders
the
deadline
will
probably
have
more
impact
than
the
next
joint
ministerial
monitoring
committee
march
opec
s
extraordinary
meeting
april
or
even
the
white
house
review
of
iran
sanctions
waivers
may
the
outcome
of
trade
talks
will
have
a
decisive
influence
on
the
oil
consumption
outlook
for
the
rest
of
the
year
since
the
threat
of
tariffs
and
associated
uncertainty
are
proving
the
largest
drag
on
global
economic
growth
because
the
trade
deadline
comes
first
the
outturn
will
shape
the
subsequent
strategic
choices
made
by
opec
and
its
allies
over
oil
production
and
the
white
house
on
how
far
to
toughen
iran
sanctions
uncertainty
about
the
outlook
for
global
trade
has
already
pushed
the
world
economy
close
to
the
brink
of
recession
judging
by
a
range
of
business
surveys
and
statistics
on
trade
volumes
chartbook
china
s
manufacturers
reported
a
fall
in
business
activity
in
december
and
january
and
the
official
purchasing
managers
index
has
fallen
to
its
lowest
level
for
three
years
global
manufacturers
have
reported
declining
export
orders
for
five
months
now
according
to
the
new
export
orders
component
of
the
jpmorgan
global
pmi
with
new
business
falling
at
the
fastest
rate
since
freight
flows
through
hong
kong
international
airport
the
world
s
busiest
air
cargo
hub
are
also
falling
at
the
fastest
rate
since
according
to
government
statistics
the
only
significant
exception
to
the
global
slowdown
has
been
the
united
states
itself
where
manufacturers
report
a
continued
widespread
upturn
albeit
more
slowly
than
the
frenzied
rates
in
late
and
early
in
the
rest
of
the
world
the
slowdown
has
taken
a
toll
on
current
and
prospective
oil
consumption
growth
pushing
the
global
market
towards
surplus
and
causing
prices
to
fall
sharply
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
biggest
impact
of
the
slowdown
is
being
felt
in
the
consumption
of
middle
distillates
such
as
diesel
and
jet
fuel
used
in
trucking
shipping
railroads
and
airlines
as
well
as
by
manufacturers
miners
and
farmers
given
distillate
s
predominant
use
in
freight
transport
and
industry
distillate
consumption
and
prices
have
been
closely
correlated
with
the
business
cycle
at
and
global
levels
in
the
last
years
if
the
economy
slides
into
an
extended
slowdown
or
worse
an
outright
recession
distillate
prices
will
come
under
renewed
pressure
and
take
crude
prices
down
with
them
the
global
economy
has
been
battered
by
a
series
of
negative
shocks
in
the
last
six
to
months
including
the
stalled
brexit
negotiations
rising
interest
rates
an
appreciating
dollar
and
sharp
falls
in
world
equity
markets
but
the
largest
source
of
uncertainty
stems
from
the
deteriorating
trading
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
china
which
is
spilling
over
to
both
countries
trading
networks
the
resolution
of
tensions
will
therefore
have
more
impact
on
the
global
economic
outlook
and
oil
consumption
than
any
other
single
factor
in
of
all
possible
outcomes
four
are
the
most
likely
comprehensive
agreement
settling
all
or
nearly
all
outstanding
issues
between
the
two
countries
limited
agreement
settling
some
issues
but
leaving
more
difficult
items
to
be
dealt
with
later
risking
recurrent
tensions
no
deal
but
with
an
agreement
to
postpone
the
tariff
deadline
while
the
two
sides
continue
negotiating
risking
recurrent
tensions
no
deal
with
an
immediate
imposition
of
tariffs
on
china
s
exports
a
comprehensive
agreement
on
all
issues
would
be
the
most
positive
result
and
could
lead
to
a
major
boost
in
business
confidence
but
because
some
issues
are
so
difficult
it
is
also
probably
the
least
likely
of
those
four
possible
outcomes
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
no
deal
and
immediate
imposition
of
tariffs
would
be
the
most
negative
outcome
and
the
resulting
shock
to
confidence
and
markets
would
make
a
recession
very
likely
the
risks
of
no
deal
give
policymakers
in
china
and
the
united
states
a
powerful
incentive
to
compromise
provided
they
can
save
face
and
present
any
accord
in
a
favourable
light
to
domestic
audiences
the
intermediate
outcomes
of
a
limited
accord
or
continued
negotiations
would
avoid
the
worst
recession
risks
but
do
little
to
rekindle
business
confidence
so
have
little
impact
on
the
trajectory
of
the
economy
comprehensive
agreement
is
obviously
more
positive
for
oil
consumption
while
no
deal
would
pose
the
greatest
risk
for
oil
demand
comprehensive
agreement
would
allow
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
allies
to
contemplate
relaxing
their
output
curbs
but
might
make
the
white
house
hesitate
about
toughening
sanctions
on
iran
by
contrast
no
deal
would
probably
force
opec
and
its
allies
to
consider
even
deeper
production
cuts
but
also
give
the
white
house
more
scope
to
reduce
or
eliminate
sanctions
waivers
for
iran
s
crude
customers
opec
and
its
allies
will
need
a
clear
idea
of
the
white
house
s
approach
to
iran
before
they
make
any
decision
about
adjusting
output
to
avoid
repeating
the
miscommunication
that
dogged
the
last
sanctions
deadline
in
the
white
house
will
therefore
come
under
pressure
to
make
its
position
on
iran
sanctions
clear
before
the
meeting
in
to
avoid
further
oil
price
volatility
the
imposition
of
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
oil
company
pdvsa
to
deny
financial
support
to
the
maduro
government
and
force
a
transfer
of
power
to
the
opposition
has
further
complicated
the
outlook
the
scope
of
the
sanctions
remains
unclear
intentionally
but
they
appear
to
include
primary
sanctions
on
buyers
of
venezuelan
oil
and
secondary
sanctions
on
firms
doing
business
with
pdvsa
if
the
sanctions
are
sustained
for
any
length
of
time
they
will
probably
remove
several
hundred
thousand
barrels
per
day
of
crude
from
the
global
market
which
would
tighten
the
balance
significantly
but
the
lack
of
much
price
response
so
far
suggests
most
traders
expect
the
showdown
between
the
united
states
and
the
maduro
government
to
be
resolved
relatively
quickly
the
abrupt
and
aggressive
escalation
of
the
crisis
has
engaged
the
full
political
and
diplomatic
credibility
of
the
white
house
and
the
united
states
in
forcing
a
swift
transition
of
power
the
united
states
has
pushed
the
crisis
so
far
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
back
down
now
and
allow
the
maduro
government
to
remain
in
place
most
traders
seem
to
be
betting
the
standoff
will
end
quickly
with
the
replacement
of
the
maduro
administration
and
a
resumption
of
venezuela
s
exports
or
alternatively
exports
will
be
allowed
to
resume
to
third
countries
if
the
standoff
lasts
longer
and
exports
remain
sanctioned
crude
prices
will
eventually
have
to
rise
unless
opec
makes
up
the
difference
while
venezuela
remains
an
immediate
concern
the
outlook
for
oil
prices
in
the
rest
of
the
year
will
be
dominated
by
what
happens
in
trade
talks
between
the
united
states
and
china
in
the
next
three
weeks
