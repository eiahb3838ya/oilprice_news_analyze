all

which
we
expected
to
be
higher
teodor
at
sparebank
markets
said
on
the
positive
side
dividends
were
higher
than
expected
and
there
was
also
a
stronger
production
guidance
he
said
equinor
s
adjusted
earnings
before
interest
and
tax
rose
to
billion
for
the
quarter
from
billion
during
the
same
period
of
lagging
a
forecast
of

in
a
reuters
poll
of
analysts
equinor
formerly
known
as
statoil
said
it
planned
to
pay
a
dividend
of
per
share
for
the
fourth
quarter
an
increase
from
the
paid
in
recent
quarters
analysts
had
expected
an
unchanged
dividend
the
company
said
it
expected
to
generate
a
total
of
billion
free
cash
flow
over
at
an
oil
price
of
a
barrel
indicating
a
potential
to
raise
dividends
going
forward
ceo
eldar
saetre
told
reuters
equinor
would
use
its
cash
to
boost
its
dividends
further
reinvest
in
capital
expenditure
and
strengthen
its
balance
sheet
we
want
to
grow
the
dividend
policy
saetre
said
in
an
interview
adding
that
there
were
no
plans
for
share
buybacks
for
now
though
it
remained
a
tool
of
the
company
s
dividend
policy
the
priority
is
cash
dividend
he
said
equinor
said
it
expected
production
to
rise
at
an
average
percent
per
year
from
to
with
new
fields
coming
on
stream
off
norway
and
brazil
an
increasingly
important
production
area
for
equinor
its
carcara
discovery
in
brazil
which
is
estimated
to
hold
similar
resources
as
johan
sverdrup
could
start
production
in
the
company
s
presentation
showed
equinor
s
production
in
the
last
quarter
of
rose
to
a
record
high
of
million
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
boe
per
day
from
million
boe
a
year
ago
helped
by
its
onshore
shale
oil
fields
the
company
said
equinor
said
it
planned
to
raise
its
capital
expenditure
to
billion
this
year
from
billion
in
it
also
planned
to
increase
its
exploration
budget
to
billion
in
from
billion
last
year
so
far
there
were
no
signs
of
cost
inflation
that
could
affect
the
firm
s
capital
expenditure
guidance
saetre
said
rising
costs
in
an
oil
company
s
supply
chain
is
a
common
feature
of
previous
upturns
in
the
oil
industry
activity
cycle
eating
into
profits
we
don
t
see
this
coming
in
into
our
numbers
