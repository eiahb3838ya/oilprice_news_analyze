washington
reuters
the
department
of
energy
on
wednesday
proposed
exempting
some
light
bulbs
from
federal
efficiency
standards
that
take
effect
next
year
a
move
environmentalists
said
would
boost
pollution
and
power
bills
for
consumers
the
department
said
in
a
notice
that
revisions
in
two
rules
published
by
the
obama
administration
in
january
days
before
president
donald
trump
was
inaugurated
misconstrued
existing
law
and
that
it
was
proposing
to
scrap
the
changes
the
proposal
was
part
of
a
push
by
the
administration
to
ease
regulations
an
executive
order
trump
signed
the
month
he
became
president
called
for
agencies
to
ditch
two
old
regulations
for
each
one
they
propose
the
administration
has
also
rolled
back
regulations
on
pollution
and
emissions
as
it
seeks
to
boost
oil
gas
and
coal
output
the
proposal
would
remove
bulbs
bulbs
used
in
chandeliers
reflector
bulbs
used
in
recessed
lighting
and
others
from
having
to
comply
with
the
new
efficiency
standards
advanced
technologies
including
diode
or
led
light
bulbs
use
far
less
electricity
than
incandescent
light
bulbs
which
produce
far
more
wasted
heat
the
changes
would
result
in
billion
in
extra
power
bill
costs
for
consumers
said
the
natural
resources
defense
council
an
environmental
group
this
is
another
senseless
and
illegal
trump
administration
rollback
that
will
needlessly
hike
our
energy
bills
and
spew
tons
more
pollution
into
the
air
harming
the
health
of
our
children
and
the
environment
said
noah
horowitz
director
of
nrdc
s
center
for
energy
efficiency
standards
the
department
of
energy
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
criticism
of
its
proposal
the
department
will
hold
a
public
meeting
on
the
proposal
in
washington
on
the
alliance
to
save
energy
a
nonprofit
alliance
of
business
government
environmental
and
consumer
interests
said
the
proposal
would
give
a
lifeline
to
makers
of
inefficient
incandescent
and
halogen
bulbs
the
rules
stemmed
from
bipartisan
energy
legislation
passed
in
and
signed
by
trump
s
fellow
republican
george
bush
that
called
for
phasing
in
lighting
efficiency
