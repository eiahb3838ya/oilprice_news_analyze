the
united
states
imposed
heavy
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
oil
industry
last
week
looking
to
cut
off
president
nicolas
maduro
s
primary
source
of
revenue
the
sanctions
limit
transactions
between
companies
that
do
business
with
venezuela
through
purchases
of
crude
oil
and
sales
of
refined
products
here
are
details
on
how
the
sanctions
work
the
united
states
is
aiming
to
freeze
sales
proceeds
from
venezuelan
oil
firm
pdvsa
s
exports
of
roughly
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
to
the
united
states
there
is
also
a
prohibition
on
firms
exporting
diluents
unfinished
oils
used
for
blending
extra
heavy
crude
to
venezuela
venezuela
exports
oil
primarily
to
the
united
states
india
and
china
as
well
as
other
nations
only
the
united
states
and
india
are
notable
sources
of
cash
as
russian
and
chinese
firms
currently
get
shipments
of
crude
through
complicated
agreements
due
to
venezuela
s
heavy
liabilities
with
those
countries
russia
in
particular
resells
the
oil
it
receives
to
others
the
treasury
department
s
sanctions
do
not
entirely
cut
off
purchases
of
venezuelan
oil
by
refineries
however
they
stipulate
that
refiners
can
not
make
payments
directly
to
pdvsa
but
into
escrow
accounts
that
pdvsa
will
not
get
access
to
until
the
company
is
controlled
by
a
new
government
maduro
and
manuel
quevedo
who
is
both
oil
minister
and
head
of
pdvsa
have
said
they
will
not
allow
vessels
loaded
with
crude
oil
for
the
united
states
to
leave
the
country
s
ports
without
being
prepaid
numerous
tankers
are
trapped
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
venezuela
s
pdvsa
sells
oil
to
brokers
trading
houses
and
merchants
with
the
following
terms
the
shipments
are
paid
by
the
merchants
who
often
have
another
buyer
lined
up
and
delivery
is
made
at
the
venezuelan
ports
once
a
tanker
leaves
venezuelan
waters
it
belongs
to
the
merchant
the
buyer
the
company
is
then
free
to
sell
the
oil
to
whomever
it
wants
it
is
unclear
whether
payments
have
been
made
to
either
pdvsa
or
the
escrow
accounts
that
the
united
states
said
it
would
set
up
to
help
fund
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
s
efforts
for
now
companies
can
do
business
but
with
restrictions
refineries
that
import
from
venezuela
can
continue
to
receive
shipments
for
the
next
few
months
before
they
are
forced
to
get
their
supplies
elsewhere
however
since
payments
can
not
be
made
to
pdvsa
this
is
expected
to
restrict
the
flow
of
crude
oil
from
venezuela
to
the
united
states
the
sanctions
did
not
directly
mention
swaps
and
indirect
trade
with
pdvsa
that
began
in
recent
years
with
customers
including
pdvsa

international
all
have
operations
in
venezuela
and
are
allowed
to
continue
transactions
and
activities
with
pdvsa
and
its
joint
ventures
through
july
venezuela
s
production
could
fall
further
later
this
year
if
the
service
companies
which
have
already
reduced
operations
leave
the
country
chevron

has
four
operations
in
the
country

it

not
comment
