german
utility
uniper
said
on
wednesday
there
were
no
taboos
in
the
fresh
talks
it
will
hold
with
its
largest
owner
fortum
breaking
a
deadlock
between
the
two
and
potentially
paving
the
way
for
a
full
take
over
fortum
majority
owned
by
finland
has
a
percent
stake
in
uniper
activist
investors
elliott
and
knight
vinke
have
disclosed
stakes
of
percent
and
percent
respectively
talks
between
uniper
and
fortum
which
will
not
include
uniper
s
ceo
and
cfo
who
will
step
down
in
august
could
result
in
a
cooperation
agreement
or
follow
up
bid
for
the
remainder
of
uniper
investors
analysts
and
sources
say
below
are
some
of
the
developments
that
could
take
place
in
the
course
of
the
year
since
becoming
uniper
s
largest
shareholder
last
year
following
a
deal
with
fortum
has
tried
to
strike
a
cooperation
agreement
with
uniper
whose
management
had
opposed
the
transaction
from
the
while
fortum
s
chief
executive
pekka
lundmark
as
recently
as
last
week
described
the
results
of
these
efforts
as
disappointing
the
resignations
of
uniper
s
ceo
and
cfo
which
were
announced
late
on
tuesday
could
move
things
along
the
discussions
which
will
take
place
in
a
working
group
where
uniper
will
be
represented
by
its
remaining
two
management
board
members
aim
at
exploring
partnership
opportunities
on
a
strategic
and
operational
level
talks
could
lead
to
closer
cooperation
between
the
two
energy
firms
in
some
markets
including
russia
with
jefferies
estimating
potential
cost
saving
synergies
for
uniper
of
million
euros
million
or
euros
per
share
expectations
are
that
fortum
will
one
way
or
another
eventually
gain
full
control
of
uniper
given
the
finnish
group
approached
its
german
peer
regarding
a
takeover
in
the
summer
of
albeit
without
success
instead
fortum
spent
billion
euros
on
buying
the
percent
stake
in
uniper
that
held
onto
after
spinning
the
company
off
three
years
ago
picking
up
only
a
few
additional
shares
in
the
full
bid
it
had
to
make
as
part
of
the
deal
at
uniper
s
current
market
value
the
remaining
stake
would
cost
fortum
billion
euros
plus
any
premium
the
group
would
certainly
have
to
pay
analysts
at
jp
morgan
are
less
enthusiastic
about
the
prospect
of
a
bid
pointing
to
uncertainties
raised
by
a
recent
government
proposal
to
close
power
stations
in
germany
and
its
impact
on
local
utilities
if
anything
this
unlocks
an
unproductive
situation
and
we
believe
that
fortum
is
likely
to
wait
for
more
clarity
on
the
german
coal
and
lignite
compensation
jp
morgan
analysts
wrote
uniper
supervisory
board
chairman
bernhard
reutersberg
despite
saying
nothing
was
in
discussions
said
that
no
substantial
results
were
expected
before
the
group
s
shareholder
meeting
in
may
the
relationship
between
both
companies
has
been
shaped
by
mistrust
and
allegations
in
the
past
with
uniper
calling
fortum
a
wolf
in
sheep
s
clothing
and
fortum
saying
uniper
actively
tried
to
prevent
a
takeover
from
happening
one
hurdle
to
fully
integrating
the
two
companies
is
a
water
license
owned
by
uniper
s
russian
unit
unipro
if
unipro
keeps
the
license
a
russian
ban
on
foreign
entities
owning
a
majority
in
local
strategic
assets
would
prevent
fortum
from
owning
more
than
half
of
uniper
elliott
which
has
also
recently
taken
stakes
in
thyssenkrupp
and
bayer
will
certainly
have
an
external
influence
on
the
talks
the
activist
investor
has
significantly
raised
its
stake
in
uniper
in
recent
months
and
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
that
a
further
increase
was
possible
elliott
has
so
far
remained
in
its
role
as
a
shareholder
at
least
publicly
apart
from
backing
a
motion
last
year
to
investigate
whether
uniper
tried
to
block
the
sale
of
s
stake
to
fortum
given
the
size
of
elliott
s
stake
it
will
be
difficult
for
fortum
to
gain
full
control
over
uniper
via
a
domination
agreement
unless
it
is
supported
by
the
fund
given
fortum
needs
a
majority
at
uniper
s
annual
general
meeting
to
make
that
happen
elliott
declined
to
comment
and
knight
vinke
was
not
immediately
available
for
comment
