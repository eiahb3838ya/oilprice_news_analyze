high
chief

peter
vanacker
said
the
company
s
main
growth
drivers
going
forward
would
be
rising
jet
fuel
sales
and
marine

sales
as
shipping
companies
prepare
for
new
sulfur
emissions
rules
coming
into
force
in
in
we
have
already
produced
the
first
tonnes
of

we
see
a
big
market
coming
up
in
the

industry
vanacker
told

in
a
phone
interview
neste
s
cooperation
with
furniture
giant
ikea
on
plastics

be
another
growth
area
he

the

s
shares
rose
as
much
as
percent
after
its

and
were
up
percent
at
euros

which
also
has
two
conventional
oil
refineries
in
finland
said
margins
for
its
oil
products
business
would
be
low
in
the
first
quarter
due
to
a
weak
gasoline
market
but
would
strengthen
towards
the
end
of
that
period

currently
as
you
can
see
from
the

quite
a
lot
of
our
efforts
are
going
into
expansion
in

where
we
still
see
quite
a
lot
of
opportunities
for

to
utilize
renewable
residue

the
company
sees
room
for
growth
in
its

business
ahead

the
new
sulfur
emissions
limits
which
will
fall
to
percent
in
bunker

currently
we
are
very
well
positioned
because
here
in
the
baltic
sea
the
regulation
is
already
even
lower
than
percent
it
s
percent
vanacker
said
referring
to
the
new
emissions
limit
for
ships
this
will
have
a
positive
influence
on
