asian

were
subdued

after
president
donald
trump
s
state
of
the

address
failed
to
give

nosedived

was
barely
changed
with

several

still
closed
for
the

the
range
in
which
the

traded
was
limited
to
just
points
the

the
australian

shed
nearly
percent
to
hit
a
one
week
low
of
putting
it
on

for
its
biggest
intraday
drop
in

than
five

the

rba
governor
philip
lowe
said
the
bank
remained
optimistic
about
the
local
economic
outlook
but
acknowledged
rates
might
fall
if
unemployment
were
to
rise
and
inflation
stay
too
low
over
the
past
year
the
scenarios
were
more
likely
than
the
scenarios
today
the
probabilities
appear
to
be
more
evenly
balanced

said
in
a
speech
in
sydney
chris
weston
head
of
research
at
foreign
exchange
brokerage
pepperstone
said
the
comments
show
the
rba
will
react
when
it
needs
to
though
the
bar
to
cutting
rates
continued
to
be
quite
high
i
think
he
lowe
has
opened
the
door
to
a
degree
a
lot
of
people
in
the
market
do
see
the
fragility
that
s
coming
through
in
quite
a
lot
of
parts
of
the
australian
economy
he
said
trump
vowed
in
his
state
of
the
union
speech
on
tuesday
to
build
a
border
wall
that
is
a
source
of
a
deep
partisan
divide
and
said
democratic
attempts
at
ridiculous
partisan
investigations
could
damage
prosperity
trump
used
part
of
his
address
to
offer
a
spirit
of
compromise
particularly
in
areas
such
as
lowering
the
price
of
prescription
drugs
and
funding
a
trillion
upgrade
in
roads
bridges
and
other
infrastructure
some
investors
were
hoping
trump
would
offer
evidence
of
real
concrete
progress
in
the
trade
negotiations
said
nick
twidale
chief
operating
officer
at
rakuten
securities
in
sydney
the
market
had
much
more
hopes
that
he
would
come
up
with
something
more
concrete
we
didn
t
really
get
it
twidale
said
we
got
a
lot
of
positive
rhetoric
a
lot
of
backslapping
or
if
you
like
because
of
that
we
just
had
a
really
subdued
senior
and
chinese
officials
are
poised
to
start
another
round
of
trade
talks
in
beijing
next

push
for
a

american
intellectual
property

avert

dallas

kaplan
said
on
tuesday
a
process
that
could
take
several
more

the

held
up
well
thanks
in
part
to
a
retreat
in

hit
a

poor

uncertainty
about
