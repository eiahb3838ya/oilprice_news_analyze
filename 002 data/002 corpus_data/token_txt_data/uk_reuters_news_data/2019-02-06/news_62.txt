trump
was
expected
to
challenge

but
stopped
short
of
declaring
a

over
it
at

for

is

issues
are

still
outstanding

an
infrastructure
plan
is
likely
to
be
resuscitated

sympathetic

fed
president
robert
kaplan
said
on
tuesday
a
process
that
could
take
several
more
months
the
dollar
held
up
well
thanks
in
part
to
a
retreat
in
sterling
which
hit
lows
at
after
poor
survey
data
and
uncertainty
about
brexit
talks
pushed
it
below
a
key
market
level
against
a
basket
of

the

on

markets
are
now
all

a
speech
by

governor
philip
lowe
at
gmt
the
bank
could
keep
to
its
mantra
of
the
next
move
in
cash
rates
is
more
likely
to
be
up
though
not
any
time
soon
and
presumably
even
further
away

rodrigo
catril

senior

strategist
at

bank
however

downside
risks
both
globally
and
domestically
will
likely
mean
the
governor
will
be
less
confident
of
this
statement

was
the
case
