update 1-tests at cuadrilla's british fracking site show substantial gas flows
london

tests
of
the
first
shale
well
at
cuadrilla
s
site
in
northwest
england
show
a
rich
reservoir
of
high
quality
and
recoverable
gas
the
british
firm
said
on
wednesday
adding
that
rules
that
have
constrained
its
testing
work
should
be
eased
cuadrilla
is
using
a
technique
called
hydraulic
fracturing
that
involves
injecting
water
and
chemicals
at
high
pressure
to
break
up
rock
and
extract
gas
the
practice
known
as
fracking
can
cause
tremors
and
environmentalists
oppose
the
development
the
company
repeatedly
stopped
operations
last
year
at
its
preston
new
road
site
in
lancashire
because
of
minor
seismic
events
british
regulations
demand
work
be
suspended
if
seismic
activity
of
magnitude
or
more
is
detected
cuadrilla
said
it
could
only
partially
test
the
horizontal
shale
well
because
of
the
operating
limits
it
said
it
fully
fractured
out
of
stages
along
the
horizontal
well
and
less
than
percent
of
sand
was
injected
nonetheless
the
natural
gas
still
flowed
back
from
the
shale
at
a
peak
rate
of
over
standard
cubic
feet
scf
per
day
and
a
stable
rate
of
some
chief
executive
officer
francis
egan
scaling
up
the
results
suggested
a
flow
range
of
between
million
to
million
for
a
km
miles
section
once
all
stages
were
hydraulically
fractured
cuadrilla
said
we
have
also
confirmed
that
the
bowland
shale
formation
fractures
in
a
way
that
from
experience
is
typical
of
an
excellent
shale
gas
reservoir
egan
said
fracking
techniques
were
pioneered
in
the
united
states
which
has
turned
from
an
importer
of
gas
to
a
net
exporter
cuadrilla
said
more
production
data
was
needed
to
refine
the
preliminary
results
and
this
could
only
be
done
if
seismicity
limits
are
lifted
to
allow
more
effective
fracturing
the
firm
has
asked
the
regulator
to
review
rules
on
seismic
activity
to
allow
more
thorough
testing
of
exploration
wells
depending
on
the
outcome
cuadrilla
plans
to
complete
fracking
its
first
well
at
preston
new
road
start
a
second
and
carry
out
flow
testing
of
both
later
this
year
rival
ineos
which
has
the
largest
shale
gas
license
acreage
in
britain
has
called
on
the
government
to
change
seismicity
regulations
experts
have
also
said
the
limit
for
tremors
could
be
safely
raised
at
fracking
sites
environmentalists
have
campaigned
against
fracking
saying
extracting
more
fossil
fuel
is
at
odds
with
britain
s
commitment
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
they
have
also
raised
concerns
about
potential
groundwater
contamination
greenpeace
uk
said
the
government
should
not
waste
time
on
fracking
and
support
clean
energy
infrastructure
instead
britain
s
government
has
said
it
wants
to
cut
reliance
on
imports
of
gas
which
heats
about
percent
of
british
homes
it
has
proposed
measures
to
speed
up
planning
applications
to
support
the
development
of
the
uk
shale
gas
industry
the
british
geological
survey
estimates
shale
gas
resources
in
north
england
could
reach
trillion
cubic

which
could
