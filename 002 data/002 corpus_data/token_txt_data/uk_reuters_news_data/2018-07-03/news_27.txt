greenpeace
crashed
a
drone
into
a
french
nuclear
plant
on
tuesday
to
demonstrate
its
vulnerability
to
outside
attacks
the
environmental
group
said
greenpeace
said
it
had
flown
the
drone
piloted
by
one
of
its
activists
into
the
zone
around
utility
edf
s
bugey
nuclear
plant
near
lyon
and
then
crashed
it
against
the
wall
of
the
plant
s
pool
building
this
action
again
highlights
the
extreme
vulnerability
of
this
type
of
buildings
which
contain
the
highest
amount
of
radioactivity
in
nuclear
plants
greenpeace
said
france
generates
percent
of
its
electricity
from
nuclear
power
in
nuclear
plants
operated
by
edf
edf
said
that
two
drones
had
flown
over
the
bugey
site
of
which
one
had
been
intercepted
by
french
police
the
presence
of
these
drones
had
no
impact
on
the
security
of
the
installations
edf
said
adding
that
it
will
file
a
police
complaint
the
drone
stunt
follows
a
series
of
staged
by
greenpeace
activists
into
french
nuclear
plants
which
greenpeace
says
are
vulnerable
to
outside
attack
especially
the
pools
these
pools
can
hold
the
equivalent
of
several
reactor
cores
stored
in
concrete
pools
outside
the
highly
reinforced
reactor
building
greenpeace
says
the
buildings
have
not
been
designed
to
withstand
outside
attacks
and
are
the
most
vulnerable
part
of
french
nuclear
plants
pools
must
be
turned
into
bunkers
in
order
to
make
nuclear
plants
safer
said
greenpeace
france
s
chief
nuclear
campaigner
yannick
rousselet
edf
said
the
pool
buildings
are
robust
and
designed
to
withstand
natural
disasters
and
accidents
greenpeace
s
security
breaches
have
sparked
a
parliament
investigation
into
nuclear
security
which
is
due
to
present
its
report
on
thursday
in
october
greenpeace
activists
broke
through
two
security
barriers
and
launched
fireworks
over
edf
s
cattenom
nuclear
plant
in
february
a
french
court
gave
several
greenpeace
activists
suspended
jail
sentences
while
ordering
the
group
to
pay
a
fine
and
euros
in
damages
to
edf
