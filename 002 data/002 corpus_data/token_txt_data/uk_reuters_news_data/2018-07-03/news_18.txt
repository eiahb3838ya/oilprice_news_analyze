update 4-iran's rouhani hints at threat to neighbours' exports if oil sales halted
bern
reuters
president
hassan
rouhani
appeared
on
tuesday
to
threaten
to
disrupt
oil
shipments
from
neighboring
countries
if
washington
presses
ahead
with
its
goal
of
forcing
all
countries
to
stop
buying
iranian
oil
the
comments
published
on
iran
s
presidential
website
on
tuesday
and
partially
repeated
at
a
later
news
conference
in
switzerland
could
be
open
to
interpretation
however
when
asked
whether
he
intended
to
make
a
threat
rouhani
declined
to
provide
a
clarification
iranian
officials
in
the
past
have
threatened
to
block
the
strait
of
hormuz
a
major
oil
shipping
route
in
retaliation
for
any
hostile
action
against
iran
the
americans
have
claimed
they
want
to
completely
stop
iran
s
oil
exports
they
don
t
understand
the
meaning
of
this
statement
because
it
has
no
meaning
for
iranian
oil
not
to
be
exported
while
the
region
s
oil
is
exported
the
website
quoted
him
as
saying
when
asked
at
a
news
conference
in
bern
later
on
tuesday
whether
those
comments
constituted
a
threat
to
interfere
with
the
shipping
of
neighboring
countries
rouhani
said
assuming
that
iran
could
become
the
only
oil
producer
unable
to
export
its
oil
is
a
wrong
assumption
the
united
states
will
never
be
able
to
cut
iran
s
oil
the
united
states
pulled
out
of
a
multinational
deal
in
may
to
lift
sanctions
against
iran
in
return
for
curbs
to
its
nuclear
program
washington
has
since
told
countries
they
must
halt
all
imports
of
iranian
oil
from
or
face
financial
measures
with
no
exemptions
rouhani
said
the
new
pressure
would
never
succeed
it
is
incorrect
and
unwise
to
imagine
that
some
day
all
producer
countries
will
be
able
to
export
their
surplus
oil
and
iran
will
not
be
able
to
export
its
oil
he
said
the
iranian
president
is
in
europe
to
gather
support
ahead
of
a
meeting
later
this
week
between
iran
and
the
five
global
powers
that
are
still
party
to
the
nuclear
deal
iran
will
remain
committed
to
the
deal
as
long
as
its
interests
are
preserved
rouhani
said
tehran
said
its
foreign
minister
would
meet
counterparts
from
allies
britain
france
and
germany
as
well
as
russia
and
china
in
vienna
on
friday
to
discuss
ways
of
maintaining
the
nuclear
deal
the
five
other
powers
have
all
said
they
still
support
the
deal
despite
the
decision
to
withdraw
iran
has
asked
the
european
countries
to
come
up
with
a
new
economic
package
to
offset
the
sanctions
and
preserve
the
accord
at
the
meeting
which
will
be
held
at
the
request
of
iran
foreign
ministers
of
iran
and
five
world
powers
will
discuss
a
proposed
european
package
and
measures
to
protect
the
agreement
iranian
state
news
agency
irna
reported
on
tuesday
the
signatories
to
the
deal
minus
the
united
states
have
been
working
on
a
ministerial
meeting
in
vienna
for
weeks
and
the
date
has
slipped
several
times
since
preparations
began
for
now
that
s
the
plan
an
eu
source
said
the
iranians
expect
the
others
to
say
what
we
are
going
to
do
to
keep
the
deal
we
will
have
to
see
if
it
is
going
to
be
good
enough
for
the
iranians
the
source
added
the
eu
s
foreign
service
the
eeas
was
not
immediately
available
for
comment
on
the
meeting
since
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
withdraw
in
may
calling
the
agreement
deeply
flawed
european
states
have
been
scrambling
to
ensure
iran
gets
enough
economic
benefits
to
persuade
it
to
maintain
the
nuclear
curbs
required
in
the
deal
but
so
far
it
has
proven
difficult
to
offset
the
impact
of
continued
sanctions
with
european
firms
reluctant
to
risk
financial
penalties
to
do
business
in
iran
iran
the
producer
in
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
exports
about
million
barrels
of
crude
oil
per
day
the
white
house
said
on
saturday
that
saudi
arabia
s
king
salman
had
promised
trump
that
he
can
raise
oil
production
if
needed
and
that
riyadh
has
million
barrels
per
day
of
spare
capacity
