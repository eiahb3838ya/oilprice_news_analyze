the
newly
elected
ontario
government
announced
on
tuesday
it
would
end
the
province
s
program
a
policy
designed
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
fulfilling
one
of
premier
doug
ford
s
election
promises
however
it
leaves
businesses
that
bought
c
billion
billion
worth
of
allowances
in
limbo
ford
s
progressive
conservative
government
swept
to
power
last
month
ending
years
of
liberal
rule
in
ontario
canada
s
most
populous
province
and
the
country
s
economic
engine
with
a
promise
to
cut
corporate
and
personal
taxes
the
government
said
it
would
immediately
start
an
orderly
of
all
programs
funded
out
of
carbon
tax
revenues
but
agreed
to
honour
certain
contracts
that
have
already
been
signed
and
carbon
tax
schemes
are
no
more
than
government
cash
grabs
that
do
nothing
for
the
environment
while
hitting
people
in
the
wallet
in
order
to
fund
big
government
programs
ford
said
in
a
statement
the
government
says
it
aims
to
reduce
gasoline
prices
by
cents
per
litre
and
lower
energy
bills
scrapping
the
plan
that
forced
large
companies
to
buy
allowances
for
their
carbon
emissions
citing
the
auditor
general
the
government
said
the
program
could
cost
ontario
consumers
and
businesses
c
billion
with
a
minimal
impact
on
the
province
s
carbon
emissions
michael
berends
managing
director
at
advisers
clearblue
markets
said
the
pace
of
the
government
s
move
leaves
many
unanswered
questions
all
those
entities
that
have
purchased
allowances
as
they
thought
they
were
going
to
be
required
are
now
wondering
what
s
the
value
of
allowances
and
whether
they
will
need
them
or
not
berends
said
berends
believes
the
ontario
government
s
decision
is
also
going
to
impact
companies
that
are
planning
on
using
their
allowances
for
their
obligations
towards
quebec
and
california
before
the
deadline
earlier
this
year
the
state
of
california
and
two
canadian
provinces
ontario
and
quebec
kicked
off
a
auction
of
greenhouse
gas
emission
credits
to
buy
and
sell
in
the
cap
and
trade
market
in
an
effort
to
fight
global
warming
politicians
criticized
ford
s
move
citing
environmental
concerns
cancelling
ontario
s
plan
to
price
greenhouse
gas
pollution
without
announcing
an
alternative
is
reckless
and
irresponsible
said
mike
schreiner
member
of
provincial
parliament
for
guelph
a
city
in
southwestern
ontario
premier
ford
is
telling
clean
economy
companies
that
ontario
is
not
open
for
canadian
dollars
