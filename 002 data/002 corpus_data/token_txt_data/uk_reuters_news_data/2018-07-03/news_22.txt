some
kenyans
who
depend
on
turkana
the
world
s
biggest
desert
lake
could
run
short
of
drinking
water
and
fish
if
ethiopia
moves
ahead
with
plans
to
construct
two
more
dams
on
a
river
upstream
activists
said
the
united
nations
cultural
agency
unesco
put
kenya
s
lake
turkana
on
its
list
of
endangered
world
heritage
sites
last
week
because
of
the
disruptive
effect
of
an
existing
ethiopian
dam
and
irrigated
sugar
estates
over
kenya
s
northern
border
we
are
concerned
that
these
projects
will
have
implication
on
the
local
communities
who
depend
on
the
lake
for
fishing
and
for
their
livelihood
said
guy
debonnet
a
conservation
expert
with
unesco
ethiopia
is
planning
two
new
dams
on
the
omo
river
which
will
only
make
the
situation
addis
ababa
rejects
the
claims
saying
its
own
studies
show
the
dam
will
regulate
the
river
s
flow
and
stabilise
water
levels
in
the
region
also
known
as
the
jade
sea
lake
turkana
in
northwestern
kenya
gets
percent
of
its
water
from
the
omo
river
in
ethiopia
one
of
africa
s
economies
using
its
rivers
to
generate
power
for
manufacturing
and
export
ethiopia
s
gibe
iii
dam
which
was
completed
in
and
irrigation
for
the
kuraz
sugar
plantations
have
already
reduced
water
into
turkana
from
the
omo
river
said
rudo
sanyanga
africa
director
of
the
lobby
group
international
rivers
the
lake
is
likely
to
shrink
slowly
reducing
breeding
grounds
for
fish
and
become
too
salty
for
fish
to
survive
and
too
toxic
for
people
and
animals
to
drink
possibly
triggering
conflict
and
overcrowding
she
said
on
monday
ethiopia
should
cancel
the
plans
that
it
has
to
construct
two
more
dams
gibe
iv
and
gibe
v
on
the
omo
river
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
emailed
comments
these
projects
will
only
exacerbate
the
risk
for
drying
up
of
the
ethiopia
is
also
at
loggerheads
with
egypt
over
another
dam
that
addis
ababa
is
building
on
the
river
nile
which
cairo
fears
will
reduce
waters
running
to
its
fields
and
reservoirs
from
ethiopia
s
highlands
ikal
angelei
director
of
friends
of
lake
turkana
which
advocates
for
communities
living
around
the
lake
many
of
whom
rely
heavily
on
livestock
said
underground
water
basins
and
pasture
would
also
be
reduced
gibe
iv
and
gibe
v
can
not
go
on
without
the
kenyan
government
being
a
little
bit
more
realistic
of
the
impact
angelei
told
thomson
reuters
foundation
while
kenya
is
planning
to
possibly
benefit
from
buying
the
power
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
what
is
the
cost
of
this
power
on
ecosystem
in
the
longer
term
