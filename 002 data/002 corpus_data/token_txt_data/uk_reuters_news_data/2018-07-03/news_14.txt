said
consolidation
of
smaller
players
could
help
the
drilling
market
s
recovery
anybody
with
the
fleet
of
less
than
rigs
probably
needs
to
be
consolidated
all
who
don
t
have
scale
are
candidates
for
consolidation
he
said
while
there
has
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
need
to
consolidate
fragmented
rig
market
there
have
been
only
a
few
significant
deals
so
far
ensco

this

danish
shipping
group
has
been
not
yet
found
a
buyer
for
its
offshore
drilling
division
maersk
drilling
whether
it
consolidation
comes
from
us
or
from
smaller
competitors
it
will
be
positive
dibowitz
said
seadrill
itself
was
comfortable
with
the
size
and
composition
of
its
fleet
which
includes
floating
rigs
and
rigs
he
added
dibowitz
said
the
upturn
in
the
market
was
becoming
stronger
with
the
numbers
of
tenders
and
opportunities
increasing
he
said
the
north
sea
market
had
been
particularly
attractive
while
demand
for
deep
and
ultradeep
water
drilling
was
up
in
brazil
west
africa
and
gulf
of
mexico
the
ceo
said
the
company
had
continued
to
provide
drilling
rigs
to
oil
and
gas
firm
during
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
but
it
had
been
a
drag
on
business
it
would
be
absolutely
easier
for
us
to
secure
more
work
because
you
don
t
have
that
black
mark
or
flag
dibowitz
said
in
an
interview
a
seadrill
spokesman
said
eleven
out
of
the
company
s
floating
rigs
and
nine
out
of
were
employed
or
about
to
start
work
dibowitz
said
the
company
would
stick
to
its
strategy
to
provide
any
kind
of
asset
in
any
market
to
any
harsh
