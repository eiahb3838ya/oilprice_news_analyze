the
mood

in

where
a

the

s

china

this

the
big
driver
behind

is
that

prove
detrimental
for
american

bond
yields
rose
slightly
amid
the
easier
mood
but
concern
about
the
trade
row
has
helped
push
the
gap
between

yields
to
the
narrowest
since
basically
the
flat
curve
is
saying
the
underlying
growth
in
the

may
not
be
as
strong
as
the
high

rates
might
warrant
mcpherson
said
the
dollar
retreated
percent
against
a
basket
of
currencies
and
the
easing
tensions
in
germany
helped
the

to

reckon

winning

notwithstanding
the

concerns
the
broader
picture
is
the
central
bank
still
remains
the
most
hawkish
central
bank
among
its
peers
and
that
should
support
the
dollar
for
now
