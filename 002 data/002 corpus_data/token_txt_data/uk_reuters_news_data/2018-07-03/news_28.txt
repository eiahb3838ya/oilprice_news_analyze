utility
companies
in

markets
have
been
undergoing
a
wave
of
consolidation
seeking
to
create
scale
partly
because
of
the
increasing
shift
to
renewable
energy
sources
that
is
forcing
them
to
change
business
models

there

been
a

energy
a
move
to
something
that
is
much
more
based
on
digitalized
power
forces
and
a
world

smart

said
jeanette
smits
van
oyen
head
of
utilities
investment
banking
emea
at
jpmorgan
the
consolidation
via
acquisitions
is
driven
by
the
inability
for
some
to
achieve
that
organically
and
the
recognition
that
companies
need
synergies
for
this
transition
to
take
place
she
said
the
momentum
was
likely
to
continue
as
the
transition
to
cleaner
energy
would
take
between

years
to
happen
she
added
as
confidence
picked
up
