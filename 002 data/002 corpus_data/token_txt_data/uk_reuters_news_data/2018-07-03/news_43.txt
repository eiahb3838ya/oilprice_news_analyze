to
million

absorbing
at

some
of

overall
however

said
opec

as

were
currently
the
main

in

the

deployment

goldman
sachs
said
in
a
note
published
late
on
monday
what
has
become
a
concern
at
least
for
producers
is
a
slowdown
in
demand
which
may
end
years
of
consecutive
records
petroleum
demand
growth
slowed
significantly
to
bpd
in
april
compared
with
a
growth
of
more
than
bpd
in
barclays
bank
said
adding
that
this
was
mostly
due
to
higher
fuel
prices
in
asia
the
world
s
biggest
oil
consumption
region
seaborne
oil
imports
have
been
falling
since
may
as
higher
costs
turned
off
consumers
and
the
escalating
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
starts
to
impact
the
economy
there
are
signs
that
growth
in
china
has
slowed
in
recent
months
particularly
infrastructure
spending
by
local
governments
i
would
assume
that
infrastructure
investment
is
quite
energy
intensive
so
perhaps
that
had
a
effect
to
oil
demand
said
frederic
neumann
of
asian
economic
research
at
hsbc
in
hong
kong
at
this
stage
however
it
appears
more
that
growth
in
asia
is
softening
rather
than
decelerating
sharply
