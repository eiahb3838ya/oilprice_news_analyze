u.s. drivers value fuel economy over brand as pump prices rise - poll
detroit
reuters
consumers
put
a
high
value
on
fuel
economy
when
buying
a
new
vehicle
according
to
a
opinion
poll
as
automakers
lobby
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
for
relief
from
mileage
requirements
enacted
by
his
predecessor
in
a
poll
taken
may
to
june
percent
of
respondents
said
mileage
was
most
important
to
them
when
buying
a
new
vehicle
after
cost
and
safety
but
before
warranty
brand
design
and
features
like
navigation
this
is
roughly
the
same
set
of
priorities
that
adults
set
in
a
similar
poll
taken
in
july
among
respondents
who
identified
as
trump
voters
percent
said
they
wanted
automakers
to
focus
on
improving
fuel
efficiency
a
higher
share
than
respondents
who
identified
as
democrats
or
hillary
clinton
voters
the
trump
administration
has
signaled
it
could
act
soon
to
freeze
emissions
standards
from
through
the
state
of
california
and
other
states
have
said
they
will
fight
such
an
action
leaving
automakers
to
confront
two
separate
emissions
standards
within
the
market
gasoline
prices
have
risen
about
percent
since
trump
took
office
mainly
due
to
a
pact
by
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
allies
to
curtail
oil
output
to
help
reduce
an
oversupply
of
crude
they
agreed
last
month
to
boost
output
but
trump
who
has
accused
opec
of
manipulating
oil
prices
wants
group
leader
saudi
arabia
to
pump
even
more
crude
gasoline
prices
which
could
create
a
political
headache
for
trump
ahead
of
november
elections
are
a
visible
cost
of
living
indicator
especially
during
the
summer
vacation
season
a
record
million
people
in
the
are
expected
to
travel
more
than
miles
for
the
of
july
holiday
weekend
the
average
price
of
a
gallon
of
regular
gasoline
was
on
july
the
highest
level
for
the
july
period
in
four
years
according
to
aaa
the
motoring
and
travel
group
but
fuel
economy
is
a
challenging
issue
for
automakers
trade
groups
representing
major
automakers
competing
in
the
united
states
have
asked
the
trump
administration
for
more
leeway
to
meet
obama
administration
vehicle
fuel
economy
targets
arguing
the
rules
are
costly
and
not
in
sync
with
consumer
demand
those
rules
require
automakers
to
slash
the
carbon
emissions
and
roughly
double
the
average
fuel
efficiency
of
their
light
vehicles
by
compared
with
automakers
are
also
worried
that
state
mandates
to
sell
more
electric
and
hybrid
vehicles
will
hurt
profits
because
those
vehicles
are
in
a
market
that
is
shifting
toward
sport
utility
vehicles
suvs
and
trucks
one
reason
is
that
sport
utility
vehicles
on
average
are
percent
more
fuel
efficient
than
suvs
of
a
decade
ago
and
are
now
close
to
the
fuel
economy
levels
of
a
sedan
according
to
an
analysis
by
cox
automotive
which
tracks
market
data
and
purchase
trends
