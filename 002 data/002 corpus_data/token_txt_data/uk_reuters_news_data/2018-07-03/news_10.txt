increasingly
pressed

imports
venezuela
s
production
decline
to
a
low
and
export
woes
stemming
from
mismanagement
lack
of
investment
and
payment
delays
are
affecting
almost
all
of
the
s
customers
but
the
impact
on
india
is
notable
and
comes
as
its
refiners
are
now
preparing
for
a
drastic
reduction
to
zero
of
oil
imports
from
iran
last
week
pdvsa
officials
met
with
executives
from
india
s
reliance
industries
and
russia
s
rosneft
which
owns
a
majority
stake
in
nayara
energy
to
discuss
trade
issues
the
company
said
the
talks
focused
on
how
to
remedy
export
delays
according
to
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
venezuela
sent
almost
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
heavy
crude
to
india
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
a
percent
drop
versus
the
bpd
shipped
in
the
same
period
of
according
to
pdvsa
trade
documents
the
decline
is
the
second
steepest
after
the
united
states
which
has
suffered
a
drop
of
about
percent
in
crude
imports
from
venezuela
this
year
the
documents
seen
by
reuters
show
if
crude
supplies
from
iran
and
venezuela
two
of
india
s
top
five
oil
suppliers
can
not
be
secured
in
coming
months
some
of
the
nation
s
refiners
would
have
to
rely
almost
entirely
on
sourcing
the
heavy
barrels
they
need
from
iraq
according
to
analysts
indian
refiners
are
very
worried
about
supply
from
iran
but
also
from
venezuela
said
robert
campbell
from
consultancy
energy
aspects
saudi
arabia
is
expected
to
boost
supply
to
india
in
the
short
term
but
those
barrels
would
not
match
the
quality
of
the
missing
venezuelan
crude
he
added
the
lack
of
heavy
barrels
is
not
a
problem
only
in
the
atlantic
basin
but
in
asia
as
well
he
added
pdvsa
and
nayara
did
not
reply
to
requests
for
comment
india
s
reliance
declined
to
comment
india
is
the
world
s
fourth
largest
refiner
after
the
united
states
china
and
russia
while
chinese
and
russian
firms
resell
a
large
portion
of
the
venezuelan
crude
and
fuel
they
receive
to
monetize
agreements
indian
refiners
need
the
barrels
they
get
through
crude
supply
contracts
with
pdvsa
venezuela
s
crude
output
is
declining
faster
than
expected
amid
insufficient
investment
attempts
to
seize
its
overseas
assets
over
payment
disputes
and
skilled
workers
leaving
its
oil
industry
due
to
low
salaries
and
an
extended
corruption
probe
within
pdvsa
the
country
s
oil
production
averaged
million
bpd
in
the
first
five
months
of
according
to
figures
reported
to
opec
its
lowest
annual
level
since
the
fall
which
is
putting
pressure
on
global
supply
and
contributing
to
growing
oil
prices
has
also
taken
a
toll
on
exports
pdvsa
last
month
requested
customers
not
send
tankers
to
its
main
port
of
jose
to
alleviate
congestion
but
vessels
have
continued
arriving
mainly
for
chinese
indian
and
clients
according
to
thomson
reuters
vessel
tracking
data
the
tanker
bottleneck
has
worsened
since
may
when
conocophillips
started
legal
actions
to
seize
pdvsa
s
assets
to
satisfy
a
arbitration
award
blocking
the
firm
from
using
its
caribbean
terminals
in
june
pdvsa
shipped
to
india
bpd
after
servicing
some
vessels
that
had
waited
for
up
to
a
month
to
load
the
venezuelan
firm
plans
to
deliver
some
bpd
in
july
according
to
reuters
and
pdvsa
data
the
unstable
crude
supply
from
venezuela
to
india
in
recent
months
has
mainly
benefited
iraq
india
s
largest
crude
source
and
united
arab
emirates
which
in
may
replaced
venezuela
as
india
s
fourth
biggest
crude
supplier
