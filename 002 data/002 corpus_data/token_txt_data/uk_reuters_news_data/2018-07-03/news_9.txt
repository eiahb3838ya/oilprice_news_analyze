will
power
may
have
filled
a
major
gap
in
his
motor
racing
resume
with
his
win
at
this
year
s
indianapolis
but
the
ambitious
australian
is
not
about
to
take
his
foot
off
the
gas
pedal
as
he
seeks
the
indycar
championship
power
could
go
without
a
win
the
rest
of
the
year
and
still
call
the
campaign
a
resounding
success
given
his
triumph
in
the
marquee
race
on
the
indycar
calendar
but
he
shifted
his
focus
after
an
emotional
celebration
at
the
brickyard
i
quickly
put
my
head
down
and
focused
forward
on
winning
the
championship
as
happy
as
i
am
about
the
i
am
still
very
focused
on
the
job
of
each
week
power
told
reuters
in
a
telephone
interview
on
tuesday
that
s
one
thing
about
the
is
you
have
to
move
on
very
quickly
you
have
a
championship
to
think
about
and
more
races
immediately
to
compete
power
who
won
the
indycar
series
championship
in
was
leading
the
points
championship
at
one
point
this
year
but
has
since
slipped
to
fifth
place
races
into
the
season
after
tough
outings
in
the
last
two
events
the
team
penske
driver
looking
to
become
the
first
indy
winner
to
go
on
and
capture
the
points
title
since
dario
franchitti
pulled
off
the
feat
in
crashed
out
in
texas
and
then
finished
last
with
engine
trouble
at
road
america
from
a
championship
perspective
i
am
still
right
in
the
game
i
just
look
at
the
potential
that
we
ve
had
over
the
first
races
and
we
should
be
leading
the
championships
simply
if
we
just
executed
said
power
who
has
failed
to
finish
four
races
in
it
s
never
a
bad
year
if
you
win
the
indy
but
for
me
it
s
about
winning
the
championship
power
had
already
amassed
an
enviable
indycar
career
but
finally
proved
he
belonged
amongst
the
sport
s
higher
echelons
of
drivers
when
he
became
the
first
australian
to
win
the
indianapolis
in
may
the
toowoomba
native
managed
his
fuel
strategy
perfectly
at
the
brickyard
where
he
took
the
lead
with
four
laps
to
go
and
then
held
off
pole
winner
ed
carpenter
before
steering
his
way
into
victory
lane
knowing
he
is
in
the
of
his
career
power
said
the
best
way
to
describe
his
feelings
after
winning
the
indy
was
relieved
i
was
starting
to
count
down
the
amount
of
times
you
get
to
win
that
race
said
power
who
won
the
on
his
attempt
it
s
just
something
that
was
absolutely
at
the
very
top
of
the
list
of
what
i
needed
to
pinguewin
to
feel
satisfied
with
my
career
and
i
ve
got
it
power
whose
indycar
wins
is
tied
with
al
unser
