iran
s
president
hassan
rouhani
said
regional
oil
exports
may
be
threatened
if
the
united
states
tries
to
pressure
clients
to
stop
buying
iranian
crude
oil
a
new
agency
reported
on
tuesday
the
americans
have
claimed
they
want
to
completely
stop
iran
s
oil
exports
they
don
t
understand
the
meaning
of
this
statement
because
it
has
no
meaning
for
iranian
oil
not
to
be
exported
while
the
region
s
oil
is
exported
