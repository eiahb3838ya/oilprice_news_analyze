australian
thermal
coal
prices
have
broken
through
per
tonne
for
the
first
time
since
driven
up
by
strong
consumption
in
asia
and
spot
market
buying
by
japanese
utilities
to
meet
demand
through
the
rest
of
thermal
coal
cargoes
for
prompt
export
from
australia
s
newcastle
port
last
settled
at
per
tonne
that
s
the
highest
close
since
november
and
up
by
percent
from
record
contract
lows
in
late
the
price
surge
has
been
driven
by
strong
demand
from
china
to
feed
healthy
power
demand
and
industrial
growth
despite
a
drive
to
shift
industry
and
millions
of
households
from
coal
to
cleaner
natural
gas
restocking
to
provide
cooling
over
the
hottest
summer
months
has
added
to
demand
along
with
constraints
on
supply
due
to
earlier
mine
closures
and
high
hurdles
to
developing
new
mines
amid
concerns
about
pollution
and
global
warming
indonesia
has
been
the
biggest
beneficiary
of
china
s
strong
demand
but
australian
miners
have
also
benefited
indonesian
shipments
to
china
saw
the
most
gains
estimated
to
reach
million
tonnes
or
approximately
percent
of
chinese
imports
in
the
first
months
of

from

a
note
to
clients
imports
from
australia
were
estimated
at
million
tonnes
or
percent
of
china
s
imports
in
marginally
higher
compared
to
the
million
tonnes
shipped
during
the
same
period
in
it
added
demand
has
also
been
supported
by
japanese
utilities
which
buy
about
percent
of
australia
s
thermal
coal
exports
traditionally
japanese
utilities
receive
most
of
their
coal
under
deals
which
they
negotiate
with
suppliers
however
talks
between
japanese
utility
tohoku
electric
power
and
glencore
the
world
s
biggest
supplier
of
seaborne
thermal
coal
were
recently
abandoned
after
they
failed
to
reach
an
agreement
traders
said
this
forced
tohoku
into
the
spot
market
to
cover
anticipated
demand
for
the
rest
of
the
year
once
it
became
clear
there
would
be
no
agreement
tohoku
went
into
the
spot
market
to
order
supplies
from
australia

one

with
a
major
merchant
who
declined
to
be
named
as
he
was
not
authorised
to
speak
to
media
about
commercial
matters
other
utilities
which
in
the
past
have
used
the
deal
as
a
price
benchmark
also
rushed
into
the
spot
market
to
order
coal
