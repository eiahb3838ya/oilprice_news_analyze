venezuela
will
receive
million
from
the
china
development
bank
to
boost
oil
production
the
south
american
country
s
finance
ministry
said
in
a
statement
on
tuesday
further
details
on
the
terms
of
the
deal
were
not
immediately
available
venezuelan
state
oil
company
pdvsa
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
the
south
american
country
previously
accepted
a
billion
loan
from
china
which
became
venezuela
s
principal
financier
over
the
last
decade
but
has
recently
cooled
on
venezuela
amid
its
economic
meltdown
and
sharply
declining
oil
production
we
have
clinched
an
authorization
for
direct
investment
from
the
china
development
bank
to
increase
pdvsa
s
production
of
more
than
million
and
we
are
already
moving
forward
specific
financing
as
part
of
the
special
billion
credit
that
the
chinese
government
has
given
to
venezuela
for
direct
investment
in
production
the
statement
quoted
finance
minister
simon
zerpa
as
saying
venezuela
s
oil
production
has
sunk
to
a
roughly
low
due
to
a
mix
of
underinvestment
theft
a
brain
drain
and
lack
of
equipment
helping
push
up
global
oil
prices
and
piling
misery
on
venezuela
s
economy
over
a
decade
china
plowed
more
than
billion
into
venezuela
s
coffers
through
agreements
that
helped
beijing
secure
energy
supplies
for
its
economy
while
bolstering
an
ally
in
latin
america
but
the
flow
of
cash
halted
nearly
three
years
ago
when
venezuela
asked
for
a
change
of
payment
terms
amid
falling
oil
prices
and
declining
crude
output
that
pushed
its
economy
into
a
hyperinflationary
collapse
