france
s
weapons
sales
to
the
middle
east
doubled
in
a
government
report
showed
as
president
emmanuel
macron
defied
pressure
from
lawmakers
and
rights
groups
to
curb
arms
flows
to
a
region
mired
in
conflict
france
is
among
the
world
s
leading
arms
exporters
its
sales
surging
in
recent
years
on
the
back
of
its
first
lucrative
overseas
contracts
for
rafale
fighter
jets
notably
to
india
and
qatar
as
well
as
a
submarine
deal
with
australia
paris
has
sought
to
increase
its
diplomatic
weight
in
the
middle
east
through
the
sale
of
naval
vessels
tanks
artillery
and
munitions
to
the
united
arab
emirates
saudi
arabia
and
egypt
the
government
s
annual
report
on
weapons
sales
due
to
be
released
on
wednesday
shows
that
france
s
total
arms
sales
halved
to
billion
euros
in
in
line
with
previous
years
where
no
major
contracts
such
as
for
the
rafale
were
recorded
however
about
percent
of
sales
went
to
the
middle
east
with
arms
exports
to
the
region
worth
billion
euros
compared
to
billion
euros
a
year
earlier
sales
to
saudi
arabia
fell
slightly
while
deals
to
the
uae
kuwait
and
qatar
soared
france
s
biggest
defence
firms
including
dassault
and
thales
have
major
contracts
with
the
gulf
it
is
not
for
france
to
conclude
piecemeal
transactions
depending
on
market
opportunities
the
goal
is
to
create
a
strong
link
with
the
importing
states
the
report
said
france
s
arms
exports
meet
the
legitimate
needs
of
france
is
now
the
third
largest
arms
exporter
in
the
world
behind
the
united
states
and
russia
according
to
the
stockholm
international
peace
research
institute
unlike
those
of
many
allies
france
s
export
licensing
procedures
have
no
parliamentary
checks
or
balances
they
are
approved
by
a
committee
headed
by
the
prime
minister
that
includes
the
foreign
defence
and
economy
ministries
details
of
licences
are
not
public
and
once
approved
are
rarely
reviewed
organisations
ngos
and
some
lawmakers
have
urged
macron
to
scale
back
support
for
arab
states
that
are
part
of
a
offensive
in
yemen
against
fighters
from
the
houthi
movement
that
controls
the
capital
the
french
government
says
its
arms
sales
are
governed
by
strict
procedures
that
are
in
line
with
international
treaties
four
ngos
including
the
international
federation
for
human
rights
on
monday
accused
the
french
state
and
several
french
companies
of
tacitly
participating
in
an
egyptian
government
crackdown
on
opposition
groups
over
the
past
five
years
the
report
cited
among
other
things
the
sale
of
personal
surveillance
mass
interception
personal
data
collection
and
crowd
control
technologies
that
have
led
to
the
arrest
of
tens
of
thousands
of
opponents
or
additional
repoting
