prices
rose
on
monday
as
opec
reported
that
the
global
oil
glut
has
been
virtually
eliminated
while
crude

discount
to
global

brent
widened
to
more

cents
to
settle
at

discount
to

was
as
much

record
million

said
the

growth
may
be
far
from
over
contributing
to

discount
to
brent
analysts
said
you
have
the
threat
that
a
high
enough
price
will
start
to
activate

uncompleted

contrastingly
opec
s
latest
report
was
more
bullish
that
absolute
plunge
in
venezuelan

highlights
how
tenuous
the
market
is
in

even
so
opec
and
its

uncertain
on
renewed
sanctions
if
iranian
crude
is
really
taken
off
the

it
s
going
to
impact
brent
much
more
than

s
going

wti
zimmerman
said
it
is
unclear
how
sanctions
will
affect
iranian
oil
much
will
depend
on
how
other
major

consumers
respond
to
washington
s
action
against
tehran

will
take
