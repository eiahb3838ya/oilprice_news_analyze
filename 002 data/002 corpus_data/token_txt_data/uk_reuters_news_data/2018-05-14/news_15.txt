update 3-with glut almost gone, opec still cuts more than oil pact demands
london
reuters
a
global
oil
glut
has
been
virtually
eliminated
figures
published
by
opec
showed
on
monday
thanks
to
an
pact
to
cut
supplies
that
has
been
in
place
since
january
and
due
to
rising
global
demand
despite
this
opec
s
latest
report
said
producers
were
cutting
more
than
required
under
the
deal
while
producers
not
party
to
the
agreement
such
as
shale
companies
were
starting
to
face
constraints
on
future
output
saudi
arabia
the
world
s
biggest
oil
exporter
and
de
facto
leader
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
told
opec
it
cut
output
in
april
to
its
lowest
level
since
the
supply
deal
began
in
january
the
opec
report
said
oil
inventories
in
oecd
industrialised
nations
in
march
fell
to
million
barrels
above
the
average
down
from
million
barrels
above
the
average
in
january
the
oil
market
was
underpinned
in
april
by
renewed
geopolitical
issues
tightening
product
inventories
and
robust
global
demand
opec
said
in
its
report
the
deal
between
opec
russia
and
other
producers
has
helped
oil
prices
rise
percent
since
it
took
effect
oil
reached
a
barrel
on
monday
the
highest
since
november
after
the
opec
report
was
published
the
main
goal
of
the
supply
deal
was
to
reduce
excess
oil
stocks
to
the
average
but
oil
ministers
have
since
said
other
metrics
should
be
considered
such
as
oil
industry
investment
suggesting
they
are
in
no
hurry
to
end
supply
cuts
indeed
the
report
showed
opec
for
now
is
cutting
more
supply
than
the
group
has
pledged
under
the
pact
opec
output
rose
by
just
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
million
bpd
in
april
according
to
figures
opec
collects
from
secondary
sources
that
is
roughly
bpd
less
than
the
amount
opec
says
the
world
needs
from
the
group
this
year
figures
reported
directly
from
opec
members
showed
even
deeper
declines
in
production
venezuela
whose
output
has
plunged
due
to
an
economic
crisis
told
opec
its
production
fell
to
million
bpd
in
april
believed
to
be
the
lowest
in
decades
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
told
opec
it
cut
output
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
which
is
the
lowest
since
the
supply
cut
deal
began
based
on
figures
riyadh
reports
to
the
group
strong
growth
in
demand
due
to
a
robust
world
economy
has
helped
remove
the
glut
opec
slightly
raised
its
estimate
of
growth
in
world
demand
this
year
to
million
bpd
the
higher
crude
prices
that
have
followed
have
prompted
growth
in
rival
supply
and
a
flood
of
shale
output
opec
expects
supply
to
expand
by
million
bpd
this
year
which
is
higher
than
the
growth
in
global
demand
but
opec
forecast
headwinds
to
future
growth
such
as
the
slow
place
of
oil
industry
investment
and
an
expected
dip
next
year
in
investment
in
shale
also
known
as
tight
oil
tight
oil
production
is
increasingly
faced
with
costly
logistical
constraints
in
terms
of
outtake
capacity
from
production
sites
opec
said
adding
to
the
impact
of
cuts
the
decision
to
withdraw
from
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
opec
member
iran
and
to
renew
sanctions
has
raised
concerns
about
iranian
oil
exports
helping
drive
prices
higher
opec
signalled
the
group
and
its
allies
were
ready
to
step
in
should
geopolitical
developments
impact
supply
saudi
arabia
said
last
week
it
was
ready
to
offset
any
shortage
but
would
not
act
alone
opec
as
always
stands
ready
to
support
oil
market
stability
together
with
oil
producing
nations
participating
in
the
declaration
of
cooperation
opec
said
using
its
name
for
the
pact
on
supply
curbs
