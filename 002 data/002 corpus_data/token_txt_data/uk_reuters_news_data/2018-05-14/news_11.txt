power
firm
china
three
gorges
launched
its
billion
euros
billion
pounds
takeover
offer
for
portuguese
utility
edp
as
a
move
sensing
that
other
prospective
bidders
were
looking
at
the
company
sources
said
on
monday
ctg
owns
percent
of
edp
and
is
bidding
for
the
remainder
at
euros
per
share
a
premium
of
less
than
percent
over
edp
s
price
before
the
offer
the
stock
leapt
percent
on
monday
implying
the
price
would
go
higher
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
edp
viewed
the
bid
as
low
but
its
board
was
likely
to
meet
this
week
to
consider
it
no
decision
had
yet
been
made
to
reject
it
the
source
added
a
banking
source
close
to
the
matter
ruled
out
any
eu
utilities
launching
a
counter
bid
but
that
edp
would
negotiate
with
the
chinese
and
push
for
a
better
price
and
a
premium
the
source
said
the
offer
was
not
a
hostile
one
ctg
is
not
just
a
shareholder
it
is
also
a
partner
of
edp
said
a
third
source
familiar
with
the
offer
noting
that
the
chinese
firm
had
several
large
joint
ventures
with
edp
the
source
said
the
chinese
firm
had
sensed
some
potential
interest
in
edp
from
european
suitors
and
wanted
to
make
clear
its
commitment
to
portugal
s
biggest
company
the
source
declined
to
give
any
names
of
potential
rivals
in
addition
to
its
percent
stake
in
edp
acquired
for
billion
euros
in
ctg
has
invested
about
billion
euros
alongside
edp
in
joint
power
projects
around
the
world
anyone
thinking
of
controlling
edp
whoever
it
may
be
has
to
deal
with
this
question
ctg
has
an
industrial
project
with
edp
and
it
has
no
intention
of
going
anywhere
