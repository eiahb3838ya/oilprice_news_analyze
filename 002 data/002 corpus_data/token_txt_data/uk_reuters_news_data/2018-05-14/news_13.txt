eu
regulators
will
settle
their
antitrust
case
with
gazprom
by
next
week
people
close
to
the
matter
said
on
monday
after
the
russian
energy
giant
pledged
to
change
its
pricing
structure
and
allow
rivals
a
foothold
in
eastern
europe
the
european
commission
is
due
to
announce
the
deal
on
may
one
source
said
ending
one
of
its
longest
running
competition
cases
that
began
with
dawn
raids
at
offices
in
countries
in
when
investigators
seized
over
documents
two
other
sources
said
the
eu
decision
on
gazprom
the
eu
s
biggest
gas
supplier
could
come
this
week
or
next
the
eu
antitrust
authority
declined
to
comment
reuters
was
the
first
to
report
on
april
that
gazprom
which
supplies
a
third
of
the
eu
s
gas
and
the
eu
competition
enforcer
would
reach
a
deal
staving
off
a
fine
of
as
much
as
percent
of
the
company
s
global
turnover
relations
have
been
frosty
since
moscow
s
annexation
of
ukraine
s
crimea
region
in
sinking
further
over
a
nerve
toxin
attack
against
a
former
russian
spy
in
england
in
march
that
the
british
government
blamed
on
moscow
gazprom
which
contributes
some
percent
of
russian
gross
domestic
product
wants
smoother
ties
to
help
it
beat
last
year
s
record
sales
to
europe
in
the
bloc
charged
gazprom
run
by
alexei
miller
an
ally
of
russian
president
vladimir
putin
with
abusing
its
dominance
in
eight
central
and
eastern
european
member
states
by
charging
excessive
gas
prices
in
some
countries
and
blocking
rivals
in
others
gazprom
denies
the
charges
gazprom
s
concessions
consist
of
linking
prices
to
benchmarks
such
as
western
european
gas
market
hubs
and
border
prices
in
france
germany
and
italy
and
allowing
price
reviews
every
two
years
according
to
a
recent
draft
seen
by
reuters
it
will
also
drop
all
contractual
constraints
which
bar
clients
from
reselling
its
gas
and
let
the
bulgarian
transmission
network
operator
take
charge
of
the
balkan
country
s
gas
flows
to
greece
the
concessions
are
expected
to
be
valid
for
eight
years
the
eu
will
not
impose
any
financial
penalty
on
gazprom
but
if
the
company
fails
to
abide
by
the
terms
of
the
settlement
the
eu
can
still
impose
fines
despite
the
move
to
smooth
business
ties
mutual
distrust
between
the
eu
and
the
company
remains
high
and
many
in
the
bloc
still
want
to
see
gazprom
punished
with
fines
critics
say
european
competition
commissioner
margrethe
vestager
s
decision
to
settle
with
gazprom
with
no
admission
of
wrongdoing
by
the
company
contrasts
with
her
hefty
fines
against
tech
giants
google
and
qualcomm
for
practices
gazprom
foes
such
as
polish
oil
and
gas
company
pgnig
has
urged
europe
s
antitrust
chief
to
take
a
tough
line
and
penalise
the
company
but
to
no
avail
eu
regulators
say
a
deal
could
help
the
bloc
resolve
disputes
on
gas
supplies
to
and
through
ukraine
it
could
also
help
liberalise
the
gas
market
in
southeastern
europe
for
example
by
allowing
reverse
flows
and
giving
rivals
access
to
pipelines
