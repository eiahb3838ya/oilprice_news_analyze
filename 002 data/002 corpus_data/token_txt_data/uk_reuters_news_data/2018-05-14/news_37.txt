fits
into
a
strategy
outlined
by
aramco
executives
last
month
atc
has
started
supplying
some
condensate
from
west
to
the
east
it
started
only
a
few
weeks
back
slowly
but
we
will
have
to
make
sure
that
there
is
an
economic
sense
for
us
for
crude

aramco
chief
executive
officer
amin
nasser
told
reuters
speaking
on
the
sidelines
of
a
conference
in

nasser
said
atc
had
been
focusing
on
crude
oil
processing
arrangements
at
refineries
with
spare
capacity
which
are
mainly
located
in
europe
but
more
atc
trades
with
oil
are
set
to
follow
motiva
is
still
looking
for
ships
to
move
oil
to
the
east
the
shipping
source
said
as
price
differentials
between
crude
and
international
crude
make
such
trades
profitable
earlier
this
month
atc
was
also
one
of
the
successful
bidders
in
a
tender
issued
by
the
abu
dhabi
national
oil
company
adnoc
to
buy
condensate
for
delivery
in
july
to
september
the

said
adnoc
bought
million
barrels
of
condensate
in
the
tender
with
the
bulk
of
the
supplies
coming
from
the
united
states
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
abdulla
salem
al
dhaheri
director
marketing
sales
trading
at
adnoc
told
reuters
by
tendering
our
condensate
we
are
able
to
diversify
our
supply
and
achieve
better
commercial
value
for
example
we
are
able
to
take
advantage
of
arbitrage
cargoes
from
long
distances
that
have
delivered
adnoc
more
value
and
higher
he
added
that
adnoc
now
buys
condensate
from
various
suppliers
adnoc
started
importing
oil
in
the
second
half
of
last
year
after
a
diplomatic
row
with
qatar
atc
is
also
looking
