electrified roads: swedish project could slash cost of electric vehicles
oslo
reuters
an
electrified
road
in
sweden
that
is
the
first
in
the
world
to
charge
vehicles
as
they
drive
along
is
showing
promise
and
could
potentially
help
cut
the
high
cost
of
electric
cars
project
backers
vattenfall
and
elways
told
reuters
the
project
named
eroadarlanda
and
costing
about
million
crowns
million
uses
a
modified
electric
truck
that
moves
cargo
from
stockholm
s
arlanda
airport
to
postnord
s
nearby
logistics
hub
to
test
the
technology
a
electrified
rail
embedded
in
the
tarmac
of
the
miles
road
charges
the
truck
automatically
as
it
travels
above
it
a
movable
arm
attached
to
the
truck
detects
the
rail
s
location
in
the
road
and
charging
stops
when
the
vehicle
is
overtaking
or
coming
to
a
halt
the
system
also
calculates
the
vehicle
s
energy
consumption
which
enables
electricity
costs
to
be
debited
per
vehicle
and
user
elways
chief
executive
gunnar
asplund
said
the
charging
while
driving
would
mean
electric
cars
no
longer
need
big
batteries
which
can
be
half
the
cost
of
an
electric
car
to
ensure
they
have
enough
power
to
travel
a
useful
distance
the
technology
offers
infinite
range
range
anxiety
disappears
he
said
electrified
roads
will
allow
smaller
batteries
and
can
make
electric
cars
even
cheaper
than
fossil
fuel
asplund
said
the
swedish
state
which
is
funding
the
project
was
happy
with
the
results
so
far
with
the
only
issue
now
resolved
having
been
dirt
accumulating
on
the
rail
elways
has
patented
the
electric
rail
technology
and
is
part
of
a
swedish
consortium
backing
the
eroadarlanda
project
that
also
includes
infrastructure
company
ncc
and
utility
vattenfall
which
provides
power
from
the
national
grid
to
the
rail
such
roads
will
allow
electric
vehicles
to
move
long
distances
without
big
costly
and
heavy
batteries
said
markus
fischer
a
vattenfall
spokesman
adding
that
installing
the
arm
in
new
cars
would
be
cheaper
than
retrofitting
current
models
vattenfall
said
in
a
statement
electrified
roads
could
reduce
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
lorries
which
account
for
about
percent
of
total
road
traffic
emissions
the
investment
cost
per
kilometer
is
estimated
to
be
less
than
that
of
using
overhead
lines
as
is
the
impact
on
the
landscape
it
added
testing
at
eroadarlanda
started
in
april
and
will
last
at
least
months
so
that
the
electric
truck
can
use
it
under
different
weather
conditions
