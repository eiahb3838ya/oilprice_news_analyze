to
unify
major
canadian
pot
growers

the
country
moves
toward
legalizing
marijuana
for

use
the
deal
announced
monday
is
the
latest
in
a
wave
of
mergers
in
the
industry
as
marijuana
producers
emboldened
by
pot
legalizations
in
europe
and
a
number
of
states
seek
to
cut
costs
and
gain
scale
canada
s
relaxed
regulations
a
mature
industry
and
capital
have
offered
firms
a
unique
opportunity
to
advance
research
without
the
legal
and
political
risks
that
bog
down
growers
in
the
united
states
and
elsewhere
canadian
regulators
have
granted
over
firms
licenses
to
produce
and
sell
medical
marijuana
with
more
than
half
granted
in
or
aurora
and
medreleaf
together
expect
to
produce
over
kilograms
per
year
of
cannabis
through
nine
facilities
in
canada
and
two
in
denmark
the
combination
strengthens
our
capacity
to
service
the
rapidly
expanding
global
medical
cannabis
markets
and
amplifies
our
advantage
aurora
chief
executive
officer
terry
booth
said
in
a
statement
canada
is
one
of
the
few
countries
that
exports
marijuana
allowing
growers
to
take
immediate
advantage
of
recent
medical
pot
legalizations
in
more
than
countries
the
worldwide
legal
marijuana
market
is
expected
to
generate
revenue
worth

by
end
of
according
to
market
consultancy
by
grand
view
research
aurora
is
targeting
mostly
europe
for
exports
the
demand
is
firmly
in
place
in
terms
of
their
medical
market
said
alan
brochstein
founder
of
information
provider
investor
europe
has
perhaps
a
better
program
initially
in
terms
of
insurance
coverage
and
distribution
through
pharmacies
he
added
the
acquisition
is
aurora
s
second
large
deal

c
representing
an
percent
premium
to
medreleaf
s
friday
closing
price
aurora
would
likely
sign
more
deals
but
not
any
as
big
as
the
medreleaf
acquisition
booth
said
at
a
media
conference
in
toronto
the
company
would
also
consider
listing
its
shares
in
new
york
he
added
aurora
has
been
pretty
aggressive
with
their
expansion
plans
but
now
shareholders
will
want
to
see
those
assets
being
put
to
use
before
the
company
rushes
out
and
buys
something
else
