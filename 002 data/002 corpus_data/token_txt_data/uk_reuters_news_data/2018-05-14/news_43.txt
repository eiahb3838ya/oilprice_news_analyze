the

marks
the

jpmorgan
said
trump
also
needs
china
to
remain
on
side
ahead
of
his
meeting
with
north
korea
s
kim
and
this
also
suggests
that
until
the
june
meeting
the
signalling
from
the
on
trade
will
be
more
the
united
states
has
said
it
will
lift
sanctions
on
pyongyang
if
north
korea
agrees
to
completely
dismantle
its
nuclear
weapons
program

the
malaysian
ringgit
slipped
percent
to
a
trough
against
the
dollar
in
the
first
onshore
trade
since
a
shock
election
upset
last
week
it
has
come
off
lows
since
then
while

sank
as
much
as

at
one

but

bounced

veteran
mahathir
mohamad
came
out
of
political
retirement
to
lead
the
opposition
pakatan
harapan
alliance
of
hope
to
a
stunning
victory
against
prime
minister
najib
razak
a
former
protege
he
had
accused
of
corruption
some
investors
were
concerned
that
populist
promises
such
as
repealing
an
unpopular
goods
and
services
tax
and
restoring
a
petrol
subsidy
could
undermine
the
country
s
finances
but
some
analysts
on
monday
said
mahathir
s
proposals
could
be
positive
for
the
economy
the
repeal
of
gst
while
only
marginally
negative
for
the
fiscal
deficit
will
be
a
boon
for
consumers
who
have
been
upset
that
they
bear
the
burden
of
poor
fiscal
management
and
came
out
to
vote
against
the
establishment
said
trinh
nguyen
senior
economist
at
natixis
while
tensions
in
the
korean
peninsula
have
eased
plans
to
reintroduce
sanctions
against
iran
have
stoked
anxiety
in
the
middle
east
iran
pumps
about
percent
of
the
world
s
oil
and
the
latest
development
has
sent
oil
prices
near
highs
citi
analyst
mark
schofield
said
rising
oil
prices
risk
causing
stagflation
which
could
create
a
particularly
hostile
environment
for
risk
assets
the
united
states
threatened
on
sunday
to
impose
sanctions
on
european
companies
that
do
business
with
iran
as
the
remaining
participants
in
the
iran
nuclear
accord
stiffened
their
resolve
to
keep
that
agreement
operational
in
currencies
the
dollar
dipped
was
barely
changed
at
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
after
three
straight
days
of
losses
against
the
japanese
yen
it
ticked
up
to
per
dollar
remaining
largely
in
a
holding
pattern
since
late
last
month
the
euro
inched
percent
up
to
following
two
consecutive
sessions
of
gains
as
italy
s
parties
looked
likely
to
form
the
next
government
last
week
the
bank
of
england
held
rates
steady
and
new
zealand
s
central
bank
said
the
official
cash
rate
will
remain
at
historic
lows
of
percent
for
some
that
leaves
the
fed
as
the
only
major
central
bank
in
the
world
committed
to
rate
increases
although
recent
data
showing
moderate
inflation
reading
has
cast
doubt
over
the
pace
of
any
hikes
