prospects
of
a
thaw
in
trade
tensions
supported
global
stocks
on
monday
as
president
donald
trump
pledged
to
help
zte
corp
get
back
into
business
fast
after
a
ban
crippled
the
chinese
technology
company
while
oil
prices
recovered
some

ground
trump
s
comments
on
sunday
came
ahead
of
a
second
round
of
trade
talks
between
and
chinese
officials
this
week
to
resolve
an
escalating
trade
dispute
china
had
said
last
week
its
stance
in
the
negotiations
would
not
change
the
msci
world
equity
index
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
was
up
percent
holding
at
its
highest
level
in
seven
weeks
and
in
positive
territory
for
the
year
european
stocks
dipped
percent
as
financials
weighed
while
emini
futures
for
the
s
p
rose
percent
there
have
been
some
very
serious
issues
raised
in
terms
of
the
trade
relationship
between
the
and
china
and
then
they
ve
had
this
quite
sudden
on
this
particular
company
and
it
simply
raises
questions
as
to
what
the
underlying
policy
is
said
alastair
george
chief
strategist
at
edison
investment
research
this
is
perhaps
a
little
reminder
which
is
being
relatively
by
markets
over
the
last
hours
that
with
the
administration
there
is
a
strong
degree
of
unpredictability
compared
to
prior
regimes
george
added
the
united
states
has
said
it
will
lift
sanctions
on
pyongyang
if
north
korea
agrees
to
completely
dismantle
its
nuclear
weapons
program
stocks
in
asia
were
also
upbeat
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
rose
percent
while
japan
s
nikkei
also
tacked
on
percent
chinese
shares
came
off
the
day
s
highs
but
still
ended
in
positive
territory
after
trump
s
comments
on
zte
corp
which
jpmorgan
analysts
said
was
a
significant
positive
shanghai
s
sse
composite
index
rose
percent
while
the
rallied
percent
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
index
climbed
percent
elsewhere
in
asia
the
malaysian
ringgit
recovered
losses
after
sliding
percent
to
a
trough
against
the
dollar
in
the
first
onshore
trade
since
a
shock
election
upset
last
week
malaysian
stocks
sank
as
much
as
percent
at
one
point
but
ended
percent
higher
veteran
mahathir
mohamad
came
out
of
political
retirement
to
lead
the
opposition
pakatan
harapan
alliance
of
hope
to
a
stunning
victory
defeating
prime
minister
najib
razak
a
former
protege
whom
he
had
accused
of
corruption
some
investors
were
concerned
that
populist
promises
such
as
repealing
an
unpopular
goods
and
services
tax
and
restoring
a
petrol
subsidy
could
undermine
the
country
s
finances
but
some
analysts
believe
mahathir
s
proposals
could
be
positive
for
the
economy
the
repeal
of
gst
while
only
marginally
negative
for
the
fiscal
deficit
will
be
a
boon
for
consumers
who
have
been
upset
that
they
bear
the
burden
of
poor
fiscal
management
and
came
out
to
vote
against
the
establishment
said
trinh
nguyen
senior
economist
at
natixis
while
tensions
in
the
korean
peninsula
have
eased
plans
to
reintroduce
sanctions
against
iran
have
stoked
anxiety
in
the
middle
east
iran
pumps
about
percent
of
the
world
s
oil
and
the
latest
development
has
sent
oil
prices
to
near
highs
citi
analyst
mark
schofield
said
rising
oil
prices
risk
causing
stagflation
which
could
create
a
particularly
hostile
environment
for
risk
assets
on
monday
crude
traded
flat
at
a
barrel
and
brent
was
up
at
clawing
back
previous
losses
after
a
relentless
rise
in
drilling
activity
pointed
to
increased
output
the
united
states
threatened
on
sunday
to
impose
sanctions
on
european
companies
that
do
business
with
iran
as
the
remaining
participants
in
the
iran
nuclear
accord
stiffened
their
resolve
to
keep
that
agreement
operational
in
currencies
the
dollar
dipped
percent
to
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
and
was
set
for
its
fourth
straight
day
of
losses
against
the
japanese
yen
it
ticked
down
to
per
dollar
remaining
largely
in
a
holding
pattern
since
late
last
month
the
euro
rose
percent
to
following
two
consecutive
sessions
of
gains
as
italy
s
parties
looked
likely
to
form
the
next
government
last
week
the
bank
of
england
held
rates
steady
and
new
zealand
s
central
bank
said
the
official
cash
rate
will
remain
at
historic
lows
of
percent
for
some
time
that
leaves
the

as
the
only
major
central
bank
in
the
world
committed
to
rate
increases
although
recent
data
showing
a
moderate
inflation
reading
has
cast
doubt
over
the
pace
of
any
hikes
the
treasury
yield
was
slightly
higher
at

spot
gold
dipped
percent
at
an

after
eking

a
