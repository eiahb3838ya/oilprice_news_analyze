update 1-trump to mull u.s. biofuels policy options in cabinet meeting monday
new
york
reuters
president
donald
trump
will
review
a
list
of
potential
changes
to
the
nation
s
renewable
fuel
laws
at
a
meeting
with
members
of
his
cabinet
on
monday
two
sources
said
as
biofuels
groups
warned
against
any
action
that
would
weaken
ethanol
demand
trump
in
recent
months
has
waded
deep
into
the
controversial
issue
of
reforming
the
renewable
fuel
standard
a
law
requiring
refiners
to
blend
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
into
their
fuel
pool
each
year
or
buy
credits
from
those
who
do
merchant
refiners
like
valero
and
pbf
energy
pulled
trump
into
the
debate
arguing
that
complying
with
the
regulation
has
grown
too
costly
and
will
kill
off
the
types
of
jobs
trump
had
promised
to
defend
but
trump
s
efforts
to
reform
the
law
have
been
met
by
fierce
opposition
from
corn
farmers
and
ethanol
producers
who
are
quick
to
remind
the
president
that
he
also
vowed
to
preserve
the
rfs
during
campaign
stops
monday
s
meeting
will
include
environmental
protection
agency
chief
scott
pruitt
and
agricultural
secretary
sonny
perdue
pruitt
heads
into
the
meeting
under
pressure
from
lawmakers
to
resign
over
allegations
he
broke
ethics
rules
by
renting
a
room
in
a
washington
condo
owned
by
the
wife
of
an
energy
industry
lobbyist
pruitt
and
perdue
have
spent
the
last
several
weeks
compiling
a
list
of
options
for
trump
to
consider
on
the
rfs
ranging
from
more
aggressive
tactics
like
capping
the
prices
of
blending
credits
called
rins
to
lifting
seasonal
restrictions
on
gasoline
sales
a
waiver
or
cap
on
rin
prices
would
fundamentally
undermine
the
renewable
fuel
standard
and
deal
a
massive
blow
to
rural
america
iowa
republican
senator
chuck
grassley
said
in
a
statement
on
friday
in
recent
weeks
advisers
have
urged
trump
to
let
lawmakers
tackle
the
issue
and
only
use
the
threat
of
executive
action
to
coerce
them
to
make
it
a
priority
iowa
farmers
and
biofuel
groups
sent
a
letter
to
grassley
and
fellow
iowa
republican
senator
joni
ernst
on
friday
urging
them
to
reach
out
to
trump
to
express
their
anger
any
administration
action
to
waive
or
cap
rins
will
be
viewed
as
nothing
less
than
a
declaration
of
war
on
rural
america
and
a
complete
abdication
of
his
repeated
promises
to
protect
the
rfs
said
the
letter
orchestrated
by
the
iowa
renewable
fuels
association
biofuel
groups
are
also
frustrated
with
the
administration
over
reports
that
the
epa
was
exempting
small
refineries
from
the
program
including
three
owned
by
one
of
the
nation
s
largest
refining
companies
