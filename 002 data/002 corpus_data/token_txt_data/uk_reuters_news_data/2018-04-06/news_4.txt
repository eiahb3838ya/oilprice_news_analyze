and
global
equity
markets
tumbled
on
friday
after
president
donald
trump
upped
the
ante
in
a
trade
dispute
with
china
reviving
investor
jitters
about
the
impact
a
tariff
war
could
have
on
the
world
economy
msci
s
gauge
of
worldwide
equity
markets
fell
more
than
percent
and

after

on
chinese
goods
china
warned
it
was
fully
prepared
to
respond
with
a
fierce
counter
strike
of
fresh
trade
measures
if
the
united
states
follows
through
on
trump
s
latest
threat
the
equity
rout
picked
up
during
a
speech
by
federal
reserve
chairman
jerome
powell
in
chicago
on
the
economy
powell
said
it
was
too
early
to
tell
if
the
threatened
tariffs
would
materialise
or
the
effect
they
might
have
what
powell
is
signalling
to
market
participants
is
that
the
fed
is
not
swayed
or
rattled
by
equity
market
volatility
at
this
point
that
s
the
reason
for
the
additional
selling
pressure
said
chad
morganlander
a
portfolio
manager
at
washington
crossing
advisors
in
florham
park
new
jersey
the
fed
has
the
intestinal
fortitude
to
wait
until
it
creeps
into
credit
conditions
and
causes
financial
stress
he
said
the
ftseurofirst

which
closed
before
powell
s
speech
fell
percent

ended
the

down
slightly
to
regain
a
measure
of
calm
after
an
initial
reaction
to
trump
s
latest
tariff
proposal
defensive
stocks
such
as
utilities
or
telecoms
were
among
a
handful
of
european

the

the

is
due
more
to
its
current
vulnerable
state

the

of
a
trade
war

fears
he
said
powell
said
the
central
bank
will
likely
need
to
keep
raising
interest
rates
to
keep
inflation
under
control
a
weak
unemployment
report
which
nonetheless
highlighted

nearly
every

though
investors
have
been
dealing
with
some
relatively
weighty
challenges
this

the

is
largely
