stock
markets
edged
downwards
on
friday
after
president
donald
trump
s
threat
to
impose
an
extra
billion
in
tariffs
on
china
exacerbated
fears
of
a
more
serious
trade
dispute
while
the
dollar
paused
ahead
of
crucial
payrolls
data
european
shares
followed
their
asian
counterparts
into
the
red
but
the
falls
were
limited
and
the
broader
ups
and
downs
for
markets
this
week
suggest
investors
are
not
yet
convinced
the
row
will
escalate
into
a
trade
war
that
threatens
global
economic
growth
the
dollar
which
has
tended
to
fall
when
trade
tensions
rise
was
largely
flat
but
is
up
half
a
percent
this
week
britain
s
ftse
dropped
percent
while
the
german
dax
was
down
percent
and
france
s
cac
percent
the
msci
world
index
slipped
percent
although
it
had
erased
most
of
its
earlier
losses
as
markets
calmed
in

s
p
futures
cut
their
losses
to
percent
pointing
to
a
lower
start
for

when

opens
in
trump
s
latest
salvo
he
said
late
on
thursday
that
he
had
instructed
trade
officials
to
consider
billion
in
additional
tariffs
on
china
beijing
warned
it
would
fight
back
at
any
cost
with
fresh
measures
to
safeguard
its
interests
any
escalation
in
the
trade
war
rhetoric
would
be
more
negative
for
china
than
the
given
the
former
s
relative
dependency
on
trade
but
for
now
the
markets
are
focused
on
the
payrolls
data
said
richard
falkenhall
a
senior
currency
strategist
at
seb
in
stockholm
friday
s
payrolls
report
due
at
gmt
could
determine
the
pace
of

s
direction
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
is
also
speaking
later
on
friday
and
investors
will
be
looking
for
any
signs
that
rates
could
rise
more
than
an
expected
two
further
hikes
this
year
the
fed
raised
rates
last
month
the
march
employment
report
is
expected
to
show
payroll
growth
of
jobs
versus
the
prior
month
according
to
the
latest
thomson
reuters
poll
of
economists
average
hourly
earnings
are
expected
to
have
risen
percent
last
month
after
edging
up
percent
in
february
the
gain
would
lift
the
annual
increase
in
average
hourly
earnings
to
percent
from
percent
in
february
the
dollar
weakened
percent
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
with
traders
reluctant
to
take
big
positions
ahead
of
the
payrolls
numbers
against
the
yen
which
as
a
safe
haven
currency
tends
to
be
among
the
most
sensitive
to
global
economic
uncertainty
the
dollar
was
flat
so
far
this
week
the
dollar
is
almost
percent
versus
the
japanese
currency
hitting
its
best
level
since
late
february
despite
the
growing
trade
tensions
some
asian
currencies
showed
signs
of
investor
nervousness
however
the
chinese
yuan
fell
another
percent
versus
the
dollar
bringing
losses
to
percent
the
korean
won
heavily
exposed
to
global
trade
also
fell
the
rising
tide
of
economic
nationalism
is
likely
to
be
a
motivating
theme
in
markets
for
the
foreseeable
future
there
is
scope
for
pragmatism
while
sabres
get
rattled
in
public
and
that
is
probably
the
most
likely
outcome
but
the
fact
is
when
sabres
get
rattled
blood
sometimes
gets
spilled
