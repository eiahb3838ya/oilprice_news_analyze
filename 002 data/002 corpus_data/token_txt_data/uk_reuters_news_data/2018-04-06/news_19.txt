algeria

offering
motorists
incentives
to
more

double

said
the
north
african
country
has
been
struggling
with
a
halving
since
of
vital
oil
and
gas
revenues
which
make
up
percent
of
the
budget
and
percent
of
exports
it
has
banned

the

is
offering
to
cover
partially
the
cost
of
car
conversions
for
drivers
tax
exemptions
and
a
stable
retail
price
for
lpg
of
which
domestic

is
sufficient

mohamed
bouzeriba
head
of
the
national
agency
for
the
promotion
and
rationalisation
of
the
use
of
energy
so
far
only
cars
run
on

out
of
a
total
million
making
the
switch
is
appealing
for
some
algerians
who
complain
about
imported
food
inflation

only
lpg
can
help
me
rebalance
my

risen
significantly
in
recent
years
due

aimed
at
diversifying
the
economy

gas
algeria
has
also
been
building
thousands
of
subsidised
housing
units
and
connecting
them
to
the
power
grid
to
boost
power
output
the

plans
to
invite

the
state
electricity

has
started
to
replace

roads
under
an
programme
officials
say
measures
may
also
include
higher
electricity
prices

must
comply
with
rationalisation
especially
in

urging
people
to
reduce

it
is
also
promoting
solar
water
heaters
lamps
and
thermal
insulation
in
the
housing
sector
but
analysts
say
making
some
appliances
available
may
need
additional
spending

imports
most
of
its
needs
