fell
on
friday
after
president
donald
trump
upped
the
ante
in
a
trade
dispute
with
china
that
added
to
investor
jitters
about
the
potential
impact
the

on

threatened
late
thursday
to
slap

on
an

china
warned
it
was
fully
prepared
to
respond
with
a
fierce
counter
strike
of
fresh

measures
if
the

follows
through
on
trump
s
latest
threat
a
weak

helped
push

higher
as
the

created
the
fewest
jobs
in
six
months
in
march
but
the
market
s
main
focus
was
on
mounting
tensions
the
jobs
report
is
taking
a
back
seat
to
the
trade
discussion

as
china

the

conjuring
up
