it
is
dawn
along
the
waiyaki
way
highway
on
the
northwest
side
of
nairobi
but
road
into
town
is
already
packed
with
traffic
of
every
stripe
as
a
van
skids
into
a
bus
stop
a
young
man
in
denim
jeans
and
a
yellow
sweatshirt
peels
out
the
door
beckoning
to
passengers
looking
for
a
ride
to
town
the
more
energetic
ones
shove
their
way
through
the
crowd
to
the
vehicle
s
doorway
but
only
one
pair
manage
to
squeeze
into
the
two
empty
passenger
seats
restlessly
the
others
pull
back
to
wait
for
the
next
passenger
vehicle
but
nearby
a
smiling
mercy
njoroge
walks
briskly
by
on
her
own
more
efficient
transport
system

njoroge
a
accountant
is
among
a
growing
number
of
the
city
s
workers
who
are
opting
to
walk
to
work
both
to
avoid
the
daily
traffic
scramble
and
because
they
want
to
cut
air
pollution
caused
by
vehicle
emissions
i
have
a
car
but
i
only
use
it
during
weekends
because
there
are
fewer
people
and
traffic
going
into
the
city
njoroge
said
in
an
interview
with
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
my
choice
to
walk
to
and
from
work
was
inspired
by
the
need
to
do
something
about
the
environment
and
pollution
that
is
ailing
our
city
she
said
she
walks
an
impressive
eight
kilometers
each
day
between
her
home
and
her
office
at
an
organisation
that
lobbies
to
protect
maids
and
other
household
workers
but
a
growing
share
of
nairobi
residents
are
similarly
taking
to
their
feet
though
usually
over
shorter
distances
according
to
the
nairobi
county
environment
department
the
city
s
middle
class
is
increasingly
showing
an
interest
in
protecting
the
environment
and
avoiding
traffic
with
at
least
one
in
middle
class
commuters
now
walking
to
work
instead
of
driving
this
is
in
solidarity
to
cutting
air
pollution
said
mahmoud
dagane
a
county
executive
committee
member
who
has
worked
on
environment
and
transport
issues
at
the
january
launch
of
a
nairobi
beautification
programme
more
kenyans
living
within
five
kilometers
of
their
jobs
need
to
walk
or
ride
a
bicycle
to
work
to
reduce
the
amount
of
traffic
on
nairobi
s
roads
he
said
nairobi
s
need
to
get
more
people
out
of
vehicles
is
evident
in
a
place
where
perpetual
traffic
snarls
are
a
major
source
of
frustration
and
pollution
from

a
smoggy

hanging

downtown
nairobi

tall
buildings
and
pockets
of

with

occasionally
a

lets
out

unep
million
people
die
annually

due

quality
a
report
on
the

of

pollution
in

by
the
organisation
for

oecd
estimated
that

deaths

press
conference
in
march
in
nairobi
rob
de
jong
the
head
of
unep
s
mobility
unit
said
transport
contributes
over
half
of
outdoor
air
pollution
in
african
cities
this
is
made
worse
because
africa
continues
to
import
old
vehicles
which
are
known
to
be
heavy
emitters
of
pollutants
he
said
he
said
a
ban
should
be
put
in
place
on
importing
vehicles
over
years
old
the
number
of
vehicles
on
kenya
s
roads
is
increasing
with
more
than
a
month
added
in
nairobi
alone
or
about
a
year
according
to
the
national
transport
and
safety
authority
ntsa
a
government
agency
delegates
to
an
africa
clean
mobility
week
event
held
in
nairobi
last
month
recommended
that
african
countries
including
kenya
begin
using
more
hybrid
vehicles
which
combine
clean
electric
power
with
traditional
fuel
to
cut
pollution
kenya
already
has
reduced
the
consumption
of
fuel
with
high
levels
of
polluting
sulphur
by
tightening
diesel
import
laws
said
jane
akumu
who
works
on
promoting
clean
fuels
and
vehicles
for
africa
at
environment
but
simpler
solutions
such
as
more
walking
and
cycling
are
a
more
sustainable
way
to
cut
traffic
pollution
she
said
over
half
of
kenyans
already
walk
or
ride
a
bicycle
as
transport
akumu
said
but
face
tough
conditions
including
a
lack
of
safe
and
pleasant
pathways
that
avoid
traffic
why
doesn
t
the
country
have
good
infrastructure
for
walking
and
cycling
she
asked
she
suggested
kenya
build
separate
lanes
along
highways
for
people
walking
and
riding
bicycles
preferably
lined
with
fruit
trees
to
provide
shade
and
even
an
occasional
snack
this
can
enable
kenya
to
save
in
terms
of
the
fuel
import
bill
and
also
contribute
to
reduce
forces
that
cause
climate
change
akumu
said
these
are
the
kind
of
innovations
that
countries
