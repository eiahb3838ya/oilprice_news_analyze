china resists brazil proposal to solve sugar trade spat -source
brasilia
april
reuters
brazil
has
proposed
that
china
introduce
a
quota
for
imports
of
brazilian
sugar
that
would
face
a
percent
levy
to
solve
a
trade
spat
between
both
countries
but
china
is
resisting
the
plan
a
person
close
to
the
negotiations
told
reuters
on
friday
the
move
is
likely
to
extend
a
dispute
that
has
curbed
exports
at
the
world
s
top
producer
at
a
time
when
a
mounting
global
surplus
hammers
prices
china
currently
allows
million
tonnes
of
total
sugar
imports
a
year
at
a
tariff
of
percent
as
part
of
its
commitment
to
the
world
trade
organization
wto
imports
beyond
that
level
face
a
percent
levy
last
may
china
introduced
an
additional
percent
duty
on
imports
from
several
countries
including
top
growers
such
as
brazil
and
thailand
to
protect
its
industry
from
what
it
identified
as
a
surge
in
imports
at
the
time
brazil
s
sugercane
industry
said
the
duty
amounting
in
some
cases
to
percent
was
unjustified
eduardo
le√£o
the
director
for
industry
group
unica
said
on
may
that
the
safeguards
could
reduce
brazilian
sales
to
china
by
tonnes
in
the
following
months
he
said
brazil
could
ask
the
wto
to
open
a
panel
to
evaluate
the
issue
if
talks
with
beijing
are
not
satisfactory
brazil
has
since
proposed
that
a
limited
amount
of
brazilian
shipments
be
exempted
from
the
extra
levy
the
source
said
requesting
anonymity
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
subject
china
has
resisted
the
plan
but
there
has
yet
been
no
formal
request
for
action
at
the
wto
level
the
source
added
brazil
used
to
be
the
largest
exporter
of
sugar
to
china
accounting
for
roughly
percent
of
a
market
estimated
by
unica
at
around
million
tonnes
per
year
brazilian
sugar
exports
to
china
fell
from
million
tonnes
in
the
crop
year
to
only
tonnes
in
according
to
figures
from
unica
as
a
result
of
the
safeguard
in
a
recent
statement
unica
said
the
measure
is
leading
to
widespread
smuggling
of
sugar
into
china
already
reaching
some
million
tonnes
