exclusive-biofuels battle: senator moves to expand small refiner exemption
new
york
reuters
lawmakers
spearheading
efforts
to
reform
biofuels
regulations
are
considering
a
blanket
waiver
for
all
small
refineries
according
to
four
sources
familiar
with
their
draft
legislation
the
move
would
save
some
refiners
a
fortune
but
would
outrage
the
powerful
corn
lobby
the
draft
bill
led
by
republican
senator
john
cornyn
of
texas
adds
fuel
to
a
fiery
dispute
between
refiners
and
corn
growers
over
the
future
of
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
a
law
that
requires
the
refining
sector
to
blend
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
fuel
supply
each
year
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
already
has
the
authority
to
exempt
small
refineries
of
under
barrels
per
day
bpd
on
a
basis
if
they
can
prove
disproportionate
economic
hardship
from
the
costs
of
rfs
compliance
reuters
reported
this
week
that
epa
had
given
andeavor
one
of
the
nation
s
largest
refining
firms
the
exemption
for
three
of
its
refineries
that
fall
under
the
standard
the
decision
could
save
the
firm
more
than
million
in
regulatory
costs
andeavor
reported
billion
in
profit
last
year
the
report
outraged
representatives
of
the
corn
and
biofuels
industries
who
argue
giving
the
small
refiner
exemption
to
large
profitable
companies
is
an
abuse
of
the
program
that
will
undermine
ethanol
demand
the
epa
also
recently
gave
waivers
from
the
rfs
to
more
than
two
dozen
refineries
for
about
triple
the
number
granted
in
previous
years
such
exemptions
free
refiners
from
the
requirement
to
either
blend
biofuels
into
their
refined
products
or
to
buy
credits
from
refiners
who
do
such
blending
the
cost
of
the
credits
can
amount
to
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
annually
cornyn
s
draft
legislation
would
seek
to
reduce
the
burden
of
compliance
to
the
law
by
providing
a
blanket
exemption
for
all
oil
refineries
classified
as
small
according
to
the
sources
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
but
it
is
not
yet
clear
whether
small
refineries
operated
by
giants
such
as
andeavor
exxon
mobil
corp
or
chevron
would
be
eligible
for
the
blanket
exemption
the
sources
said
cornyn
s
blanket
exemption
would
mainly
target
small
plants
operated
by
private
companies
they
said
after
the
reuters
report
on
the
andeavor
exemption
a
handful
of
biofuels
groups
called
for
a
moratorium
on
new
exemptions
and
greater
transparency
in
the
waiver
program
which
the
epa
runs
largely
in
secret
to
protect
what
it
has
deemed
the
companies
private
information
the
renewable
fuels
association
filed
a
formal
request
with
the
epa
this
week
seeking
details
on
who
got
the
exemptions
and
why
cornyn
s
effort
represents
the
oil
industry
s
best
chance
for
biofuels
reform
after
efforts
by
president
donald
trump
to
broker
an
executive
or
fix
ended
in
dispute
one
of
the
sources
on
the
draft
bill
said
the
blanket
exemption
was
a
big
priority
for
the
senate
environmental
and
public
works
committee
whose
chairman
wyoming
republican
john
barrasso
is
helping
prepare
the
bill
wyoming
is
home
to
several
small
refineries
cornyn
spokeswoman
ryann
durant
said
the
bill
was
still
being
drafted
based
on
stakeholder
and
legislative
she
declined
to
comment
directly
on
the
waiver
provision
environmental
and
public
works
committee
spokesman
mike
danylak
declined
to
speak
about
the
draft
legislation
but
said
chairman
barrasso
believes
the
renewable
fuel
standard
is
broken
and
must
be
cornyn
s
draft
would
theoretically
cut
as
much
as
percent
of
america
s
refining
capacity
out
of
the
biofuels
program
based
on
the
combined
production
capacity
of
all
refineries
operating
under
bpd
biofuels
advocates
worry
the
provision
would
translate
into
a
similar
reduction
in
the
volume
of
biofuels
that
the
government
requires
under
the
rfs
currently
over
billion
gallons
per
year
mostly
in
ethanol
we
support
narrow
exemptions
that
allow
some
small
refineries
out
of
the
program
but
we
vehemently
oppose
a
blanket
exemption
said
michael
mcadams
president
of
the
advanced
biofuels
council
larger
refining
companies
meanwhile
fear
the
move
would
instead
just
shift
a
greater
burden
of
the
blending
off
of
small
players
and
onto
them
the
american
petroleum
institute
which
represents
companies
operating
the
nation
s
biggest
refineries
said
in
a
february
letter
to
the
epa
that
biofuels
policy
must
maintain
a
level
playing
field
in
the
marketplace
and
must
apply
equally
across
the
whole
refining
the
sources
did
not
say
how
cornyn
s
proposed
blanket
waiver
would
address
the
overall
volumes
mandates
the
cornyn
draft
bill
also
includes
a
slew
of
other
measures
previously
reported
by
reuters
which
are
intended
to
help
refiners
while
also
helping
maintain
solid
demand
for
ethanol
among
them
is
the
addition
of
a
new
type
of
compliance
credit
that
oil
companies
can
use
to
meet
their
requirements
under
the
rfs
the
sunsetting
of
requirements
to
blend
conventional
renewable
fuels
like
ethanol
after
combined
with
an
extension
for
advanced
fuels
of
about
three
years
and
a
waiver
that
would
allow
a
higher
ethanol
fuel
blend
to
be
sold
in
summertime
