colombia
s
highest
court
has
told
the
government
it
must
take
urgent
action
to
protect
its
amazon
rainforest
and
stem
rising
deforestation
in
what
campaigners
said
was
an
historic
moment
that
should
help
conserve
forests
and
counter
climate
change
in
their
ruling
on
thursday
the
judges
said
that
colombia
which
is
home
to
a
swathe
of
rainforest
roughly
the
size
of
germany
and
england
combined
saw
deforestation
rates
in
its
amazon
region
increase
by
percent
from
to
it
is
clear
despite
numerous
international
commitments
regulations
that
the
colombian
state
has
not
efficiently
addressed
the
problem
of
deforestation
in
the
amazon
the
supreme
court
said
the
ruling
comes
after
a
group
of
young
plaintiffs
ranging
in
age
from
seven
to
filed
a
lawsuit
against
the
government
in
january
demanding
it
protect
their
right
to
a
healthy
environment
the
plaintiffs
had
said
the
government
s
failure
to
stop
the
destruction
of
the
amazon
jeopardised
their
futures
and
violated
their
constitutional
rights
to
a
healthy
environment
life
food
and
water
rights
group
dejusticia
which
supported
the
plaintiffs
case
said
the
verdict
meant
it
was
the
first
time
a
lawsuit
of
this
kind
had
been
ruled
upon
favourably
in
latin
america
the
supreme
court
s
decision
marks
an
historical
precedent
in
terms
of
climate
change
litigation
said
camila
bustos
one
of
the
plaintiffs
and
a
researcher
at
dejusticia
in
its
ruling
the
court
recognised
colombia
s
amazon
as
an
entity
subject
of
rights
which
means
that
the
rainforest
has
been
granted
the
same
legal
rights
as
a
human
being
the
ruling
states
the
importance
of
protecting
the
rights
of
future
generations
and
even
declares
the
amazon
a
subject
of
rights
bustos
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
court
ordered
the
government
both
at
the
local
and
national
level
along
with
the
environment
and
agriculture
ministries
and
environmental
authorities
to
come
up
with
action
plans
within
four
months
to
combat
deforestation
in
the
amazon
the
amazon
s
destruction
leads
to
imminent
and
serious
damage
to
children
and
adults
for
both
present
and
future
generations
the
judges
said
the
ruling
stated
that
forests
were
being
felled
to
make
way
for
more
grazing
and
agricultural
land
as
well
as
coca
crops
the
raw
ingredient
for
cocaine
illegal
mining
and
logging
deforestation
is
a
key
source
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
driving
climate
change
which
damages
ecosystems
and
water
sources
and
leads
to
land
degradation
the
court
said
without
a
healthy
environment
subjects
of
law
and
living
beings
in
general
will
not
be
able
to
survive
let
alone
safeguard
those
rights
for
our
children
or
for
future
generations
the
ruling
said
the
lawsuit
follows
a
surge
in
litigation
around
the
world
demanding
action
or
claiming
damages
over
the
impact
of
climate
change
from
rising
sea
levels
to
pollution
