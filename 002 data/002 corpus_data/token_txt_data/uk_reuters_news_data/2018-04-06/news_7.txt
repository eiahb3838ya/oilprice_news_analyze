crude
oil
and
global
equity
markets
tumbled
on
friday
after
president
donald
trump
upped
the
ante
in
a
trade
dispute
with
china
renewing
investor
jitters
about
the
potential
impact
a
tariff
war
would
have
on
the
world
economy
msci
s
gauge

worldwide
equity
indexes
fell
percent
and
stocks
on
wall
street
skidded
after
trump
threatened
late
on
thursday
to
add
an
additional
billion
of
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
china
warned
it
was
fully
prepared
to
respond
with
a
fierce
counter
strike
of
fresh
trade
measures
if
the
united
states
follows
through
on
trump
s
latest
threat
the
equity
rout
picked
up
during
a
speech
by
federal
reserve
chairman
jerome
powell
in
chicago
although
he
did
not
address
the
potential
risks
of
the
dispute
with
china
what
powell
is
signaling
to
market
participants
is
that
the
fed
is
not
swayed
or
rattled
by
equity
market
volatility
at
this
point
that
s
the
reason
for
the
additional
selling
pressure
said
chad
morganlander
a
portfolio
manager
at
washington
crossing
advisors
in
florham
park
new
jersey
the
fed
has
the
intestinal
fortitude
to
wait
until
it
creeps
into
credit
conditions
and
causes
financial
stress
he
said
the

which
closed
before
powell
s
speech
fell
percent

he
said
powell
said
the
central

will
likely
need
to
keep
raising

rates
to
keep

under
control
a

which
nonetheless
highlighted

the
