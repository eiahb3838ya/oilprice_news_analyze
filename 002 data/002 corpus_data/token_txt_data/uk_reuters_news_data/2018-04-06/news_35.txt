indonesia peatland swap plan questioned over deforestation risk
jakarta

an
indonesian
plan
to
curb
the
commercial
use
of
peatlands
by
swapping
nearly
million
hectares
of
forestry
concessions
on
peat
risks
simply
displacing
environmental
destruction
to
other
parts
of
the
archipelago
green
groups
say
indonesia
was
blamed
for
one
of
the
worst
ever
peat
and
forest
fire
crises
that
blanketed
much
of
southeast
asia
in
thick
haze
in
and
since
then
has
sought
to
take
back
and
protect
vast
tracts
of
peatlands
from
corporations
but
environmentalists
say
a
new
land
swap
policy
which
will
affect
an
area
the
size
of
lebanon
may
undermine
those
efforts
if
relatively
undamaged
land
is
given
to
companies
that
in
the
past
have
been
criticized
for
unsustainable
practices
an
indonesian
environment
ministry
official
said
under
the
deal
companies
will
be
evaluated
over
the
course
of
this
year
to
assess
how
well
they
have
restored
damaged
peatland
on
existing
concessions
before
receiving
new
land
elsewhere
for
this
land
swap
we
will
look
for
empty
land
that
is
said
hilman
nugroho
a
senior
official
at
the
environment
ministry
an
alliance
of
environmental
organizations
said
in
a
joint
statement
this
week
that
the
government
was
not
being
open
about
what
land
would
be
exchanged
we
fear
that
vast
areas
of
natural
forest
especially
in
kalimantan
sumatra
island
and
papua
will
be
designated
for
land
swaps
and
converted
into
pulpwood
plantations
in
the
name
of
peatland
restoration
the
environmental
organizations
said
kalimantan
is
the
indonesian
portion
of
borneo
island
the
policy
will
also
threaten
the
livelihoods
and
cultures
of
indigenous
peoples
said
the
statement
which
was
issued
by
groups
including
the
world
wildlife
fund
indonesia
and
eyes
on
the
forest
to
estimate
where
potential
land
concessions
would
be
given
away
the
alliance
compared
satellite
imagery
of
forested
area
with
known
government
allocations
of
land
suitable
for
plantations
and
inactive
land
with
this
analysis
we
found
that
hectares
of
potential
land
swap
locations
are
on
natural
forest
area
said
syarul
fitra
of
auriga
one
of
the
ngos
in
the
alliance
the
government
has
not
made
public
the
locations
of
the
new
concessions
that
will
be
given
as
part
of
the
swap
an
environment
ministry
document
seen

showed
companies
set
to
receive
new
land

several

one

those

was
in

guilty
by
an
indonesian

indonesian
president
joko
widodo
approved
last
year
a
extension
to
a
moratorium
on
issuing
new
licences
to
use
land
designated
as
primary
forest
and
peatland
the
country
has
suffered
one
of
the
highest
rates
of
deforestation
in
the
world
often
cleared
for
palm
oil
and
other
plantations
or
pulp
and
paper
mills
in
the
last
half
century
more
than
million
hectares
of
indonesian
rainforest
representing
an
area
twice
the
size
of
germany
have
been
logged
burned
