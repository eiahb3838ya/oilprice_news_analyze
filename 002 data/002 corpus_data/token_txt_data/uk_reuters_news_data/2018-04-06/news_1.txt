washington

environmental
protection
agency
administrator
scott
pruitt
held
more
meetings
with
industry
representatives
than
environmental
advocates
during
his
first
seven
months
in
office
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of
his
schedule
reflecting
the
agency
s
approach
under
his
tenure
the
newly
released
record
of
pruitt
s
schedule
obtained
through
a
freedom
of
information
act
request
by
the
environmental
integrity
project
watchdog
group
come
as
the
white
house
probes
allegations
against
pruitt
these
include
his
rental
of
a
room
in
a
washington
condo
owned
by
the
wife
of
an
energy
industry
lobbyist
the
pressure
mounted
late
on
friday
as
democratic
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
called
for
president
donald
trump
to
immediately
dismiss
him
over
a
host
of
ethics
issues
and
for
acting
to
counter
the
mission
of
his
agency
three
fellow
republicans
in
the
house
have
also
called
on
pruitt
to
resign
but
the
epa
chief
has
widespread
support
from
conservatives
pruitt
a
vocal
doubter
of
mainstream
climate
change
science
has
also
faced
criticism
for
frequent
air
travel
spending
on
costly
items
in
his
office
including
a
soundproof
telephone
booth
and
a
trip
to
morocco
where
he
promoted
exports
of
liquefied
natural
gas
something
outside
the
remit
of
an
environmental
regulator
president
donald
trump
has
praised
pruitt
for
aggressively
pursuing
his
agenda
to
roll
back
regulations
he
sees
as
unnecessary
to
pave
the
way
for
more
oil
gas
and
coal
production
as
well
as
removing
environmental
hurdles
to
a
revival
in
domestic
manufacturing
trump
on
thursday
said
pruitt
was
doing
a
fantastic
job
and
was
in
coal
and
energy
while
trump
appears
to
support
pruitt
the
president
can
change
his
mind
quickly
last
autumn
trump
said
he
had
confidence
in
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
even
after
their
relationship
was
strained
over
iran
and
russia
policy
trump
fired
tillerson
last
month
trump
s
chief
of
staff
john
kelly
had
advocated
last
week
for
trump
to
fire
pruitt
a
white
house
official
said
trump
met
with
pruitt
early
on
friday
said
the
same
official
who
declined
to
say
what
the
meeting
concerned
according
to
the
calendar
pruitt
met
with
representatives
of
the
industries
epa
regulates
at
least
times
from
to
of
last
year
making
up
about
percent
of
his
total
meetings
during
that
period
about
half
of
those
industry
meetings
were
with
representatives
of
the
oil
gas
coal
and
mining
industries
according
to
the
records
including
executives
from
companies
such
as
oil
major
bp
plc
refiner
valero
energy
corp
coal
producer
murray
energy
and
miner
bhp
billiton
most
of
the
rest
of
pruitt
s
industry
meetings
were
with
representatives
of
agriculture
including
farm
groups
like
the
national
cattlemen
s
association
and
biofuels
producers
like
growth
energy
and
poet
according
to
the
records
but
pruitt
met
only
four
times
with
environmental
groups
eager
to
see
the
epa
limit
pollution
from
those
industries
the
records
show
trout
unlimited
the
center
for
climate
and
energy
solutions
a
nonprofit
association
of
state
environmental
agency
leaders
called
ecos
and
the
alliance
to
restore
our
waterways
past
epa
administrators
have
been
criticized
by
conservatives
for
spending
too
much
time
with
environmental
lobbying
groups
and
too
little
with
industry
pruitt
a
former
attorney
general
of
oklahoma
said
through
a
spokesman
that
he
does
not
spend
any
time
with
polluters
i
prosecute
polluters
what
i
m
spending
time
with
are
stakeholders
who
care
about
outcomes
he
said
it
s
washington
to
look
at
folks
across
the
country
from
states
to
citizens
to
farmers
and
ranchers
industry
in
general
and
say
they
are
evil
or
wrong
and
we
re
not
going
to
partner
with
them
pruitt
said
liz
purchia
gannon
a
spokeswoman
for
former
epa
administrator
gina
mccarthy
who
served
under
democratic
president
barack
obama
said
the
ratio
of
pruitt
s
industry
to
environmental
group
meetings
was
a
contrast
to
the
ratio
of
meetings
mccarthy
held
mccarthy
met
frequently
with
utility
groups
while
the
agency
worked
to
form
the
clean
power
plan
obama
s
top
proposal
to
curb
greenhouse
gas
emissions
gannon
said
as
head
of
epa
she
always
met
with
environmental
and
public
health
groups
and
industry
and
business
leaders
she
believed
strongly
in
meeting
regularly
with
all
sides
said
gannon
who
did
not
provide
data
on
the
meetings
pruitt
also
held
a
number
of
meetings
with
conservative
policy
think
tanks
like
the
heritage
foundation
and
the
family
research
council
a
religious
group
that
argues
that
homosexual
conduct
is
harmful
to
society
according
to
the
records
a
portion
of
pruitt
s
schedule
covering
his
first
few
months
in
office
had
already
been
released
by
the
epa
but
the
latest
batch
covers
the
broadest
period
so
