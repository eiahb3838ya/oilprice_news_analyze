amit
bouri
is
evangelical
that
members
of
his
network
and
many
more
like
them
can
right
the
wrongs
of
the
world
using
the
muscle
of
their
money
and
he
said
he
knows
what
needs
to
change
to
make
that
happen
the
way
the
world
s
financial
markets
work
the
system
right
now
is
not
sufficiently
creating
an
environment
where
there
is
equality
and
sustainability
he
said
by
phone
from
new
york
bouri
heads
the
global
impact
investing
network
giin
a
he
in
that
supports
and
encourages
impact
investing
investments
that
produce
positive
social
and
environmental
change
as
well
as
generate
a
profit
we
are
positing
a
very
aspirational
vision
where
all
investors
take
into
account
social
and
environmental
impact
where
this
becomes
part
of
the
new
normal
of
how
people
according
to
oxfam
a
charity
the
majority
of
the
world
is
missing
out
last
year
the
poorest
half
of
the
global
population
saw
no
increase
in
their
wealth
while
percent
of
the
wealth
that
was
generated
went
to
the
richest
percent
bouri
said
impact
investing
goes
beyond
avoiding
harmful
investments
like
tobacco
and
weapons
and
focuses
on
investing
proactively
to
drive
change
examples
include
the
million
fund
that
built
affordable
homes
for
families
in
rural
brazil
and
clean
energy
systems
for
those
with
limited
access
to
power
including
schools
and
hospitals
that
investors
funded
in
india
the
amount
of
money
going
into
impact
investing
is
rising
by
about
percent
a
year
said
the
giin
whose
survey
found
the
impact
investing
market
was
worth
at
least
billion
it
is
possible
to
make
a
profit
and
do
good
for
the
world
that
is
what
has
captured
the
attention
of
so
many
people
when
it
comes
to
impact
investing
bouri
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
he
expects
impact
investing
will
keep
growing
not
least
because
reports
have
found
millennials
are
more
interested
in
such
issues
than
their
parents
generation
as
are
women
investors
and
will
inherit
wealth
in
years
to
come
that
wealth
is
now
going
to
be
controlled
by
people
that
care
about
sustainability
and
impact
he
said
bouri
said
the
giin
has
also
fielded
more
enquiries
from
institutional
investors
in
the
last
months
the
pension
funds
and
insurance
companies
that
collectively
manage
trillions
of
dollars
in
assets
these
are
firms
that
have
fiduciary
responsibilities
they
take
very
seriously
an
obligation
to
pay
back
pensioners
in
or
years
from
now
he
said
the
growing
effects
of
inequality
and
climate
change
on
market
sustainability
mean
major
fiduciaries
are
thinking
about
how
they
can
incorporate
impact
into
their
investment
aside
from
housing
and
clean
energy
impact
investing
was
also
effective
in
areas
such
as
conservation
and
access
to
clean
water
said
bouri
yet
he
feels
its
greatest
contribution
might
lie
in
showing
how
finance
can
work
in
a
different
way
the
giin
absolutely
believes
that
impact
investing
has
a
tremendous
opportunity
to
grow
not
just
on
its
own
but
in
influencing
how
all
investing
is
done
in
doing
so
we
have
the
potential
to
set
the
world
on
a
different
trajectory
