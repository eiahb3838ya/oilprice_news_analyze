minister

in
a
meeting
last

with
industry
officials
set
a
deadline
of
for
the
country
s
primary
natural
gas
distribution
regulator
to
set
up
the
exchange
said
three
sources
familiar
with
the
discussions
the
exchange
is
aimed
at
standardizing
natural
gas
prices
said
a
government
official
a
consultant
and
a
gas
company
executive
so
that
domestic
prices
are
not
set
at
such
a
discount
to
international
market
rates
india
currently
imports
lng
at
global
rates
of
around
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
while
the
government
sets
domestic
gas
prices
at
per
mmbtu
if
we
have
proper
pricing
and
market
access
then
it
is
easier
for
the
gas
sector
to
develop
said
atanu
chakraborty
who
heads
india
s
upstream
regulator
the
exchange
will
also
help
to
reduce
the
risks
associated
with
the
pricing
differences
he
said

the
gas
exchange
will
function
and

minister

said
at
a
conference
in
thailand
last
year
india
currently
produces
close
to

standard
cubic
meters
per

mscmd
of
gas
and
imports
another
mscmd
as
lng
according
to
government
figures
for
in
the
next
three
to
five
years
as
natural
gas
projects
from
india
s
oil
and
natural
gas
corp
and
a
partnership
involving
bp

reliance
industries
ramp
up
india

output
will
be
in
the
range
of
mscmd
said

a

mscmd
over
the

he
said
referring
to
pradhan
s
speech
sufficient
supplies
for
the
smooth
operation
of
a
gas
exchange
are
one
of
the
primary
concerns
india
s
industrial
gas
consumers
such
as
power
plants
and
fertiliser
makers
were
disappointed
in
after
promised
gas
output
from
the
east
coast
s
basin
fell
short
of
expectations
many
facilities
that
were
built
in
anticipation
of
more
gas
production
remain
stranded
without
adequate
fuel
the
partnership
plans
to
develop
three
assets
off
india
s
east
coast
and
ongc
is
developing
another
