interview-russian insurers may need more state support -lobby
moscow
reuters
russia
s
banking
crisis
and
a
weak
economy
could
spell
more
trouble
for
its
insurance
sector
requiring
further
state
support
following
the
bailout
of
top
insurer
rosgosstrakh
last
year
the
head
of
the
country
s
main
insurance
lobby
said
russia
s
financial
industry
has
been
hit
hard
by
the
fallout
from
western
sanctions
over
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
in
and
the
economic
impact
of
a
sharp
fall
in
oil
prices
three
major
private
banks
had
to
be
rescued
by
the
central
bank
last
year
alongside
rosgosstrakh
the
insurance
sector
is
not
immune
to
the
diseases
of
the
national
economy
igor
yurgens
president
of
insurance
association
told
reuters
in
an
interview
there
are
big
insurance
firms
highly
dependent
on
the
banking
sector
he
said
leading
russian
banks
such
as
sberbank
vtb
alfabank
and
uralsib
own
insurers
though
none
has
shown
any
signs
of
trouble
so
far
a
draft
bill
under
discussion
in
parliament
envisages
the
creation
of
a
fund
for
the
consolidation
of
the
insurance
sector
similar
to
the
one
that
was
set
up
for
struggling
banks
the
fund
to
be
run
by
the
central
bank
will
pave
the
way
for
ailing
insurers
to
be
bailed
out
in
case
of
an
unsustainable
financial
position
that
threatens
insurants
other
parties
or
the
state
as
well
as
the
stability
of
financial
markets
according
to
the
text
of
the
draft
bill
the
central
bank
can
then
sell
on
the
insurer
once
its
rescue
has
been
completed
it
said
the
bailout
scheme
may
increase
confidence
in
the
insurance
market
as
it
will
boost
the
protection
for
its
customers
yurgens
said
the
size
of
the
planned
insurance
fund
has
not
been
disclosed
but
central
bank
deputy
head
vladimir
chistukhin
indicated
last
year
it
would
be
smaller
than
its
banking
twin
which
has
so
far
pumped
more
than
trillion
roubles
billion
into
troubled
lenders
insurance
contracts
in
russia
totaled
trillion
roubles
in
official
data
shows
the
central
bank
has
already
spent
billion
roubles
to
prop
up
rosgosstrakh
which
was
part
of
the
wider
financial
group
that
also
owned
the
country
s
biggest
private
bank
otkritie
rescued
last
year
russia
set
up
the
russian
national
reinsurance
company
rnrc
last
year
to
cater
for
firms
that
have
been
blacklisted
by
western
reinsurers
because
of
the
sanctions
yurgens
said
that
chinese
reinsurers
including
china
re
were
also
steering
clear
of
russian
companies
targeted
by
european
and
sanctions
even
though
beijing
did
not
impose
sanctions
on
moscow
and
relations
between
the
two
countries
were
warming
those
businesses
are
not
being
reinsured
abroad
even
by
the
chinese
for
that
reason
the
rnrc
was
established
and
it
takes
on
percent
of
the
risk
yurgens
said
he
said
the
central
bank
would
keep
printing
money
to
fund
the
insurance
and
reinsurance
sectors
but
warned
this
could
end
up
triggering
an
inflationary
spiral
we
will
cover
the
things
which
are
crucial
for
the
country
s
survival
as
the
soviet
union
did
but
it
will
be
expensive
and
done
at
the
expense
