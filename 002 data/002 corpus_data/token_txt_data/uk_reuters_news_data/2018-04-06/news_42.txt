fell
on
friday
after
president
donald
trump
s
threat
to
impose
an
extra
billion
in
tariffs
on
china
exacerbated
fears
of
a
more
serious
trade
dispute

the

paused
ahead
of
crucial
payrolls
data
european
shares
followed
their
asian

into

on

beijing
warned
it
would
fight
back
at
any
cost
with
fresh

to
safeguard
its

any
escalation
in
the
trade
war
rhetoric
would
be
more
negative
for
china
than
the
given
the
former

relative
dependency
on
trade
but
for
now
the
markets
are
focused
on
the
