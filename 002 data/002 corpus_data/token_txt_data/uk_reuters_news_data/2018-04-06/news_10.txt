gasoline
stored
in
ships
off
europe
s
coast
has
ballooned
to
more
than
tonnes
putting
pressure
on
the
continent
s
traders
to
compete
for
buyers
once
summer
demand
starts
several
vessels
have
joined
the
three
initially
booked
to
store
fuel
off
europe
s
ports
in
and
brokers
said
even
barges
have
held
cargoes
of
gasoline
for
three
to
four
weeks
as
the
volumes
traded
in
europe
hit
record
levels
last
month
the
tankers
torm

ridgebury
john
b
and
sti
clapham
are
now
parked
off
europe
s
hub
where
stocks
hit
a
record
million
tonnes
last
week
according
to
figures
from
pjk
international
fuel
in
vessels
rather
than
in
tanks
on
land
is
typically
the
most
expensive
way
to
store
fuel
so
notable
volumes
of
floating
storage
only
build
when
the
market
is
oversupplied
volumes
off
the
coast
of
europe
have
risen
from

traders
said
the
atypical
floating
fuel
stores
will
target
hungry
buyers
in
the
united
states
and
the
middle
east
as
the
former
restock
following
maintenance
and
the
latter
stock
up
before
ramadan
already
some
cargoes
that
had
been
parked
off
europe
s
coast
such
as
the
nan
lin
wan
are
sailing
for
buyers
in
new
york
harbor
expectations
that
prices
in
the
coming
months
will
rise
above
the
current
levels
also
created
the
market
condition
known
as
contango
that
allowed
traders
to
make
money
storing
the
fuel
in
these
tankers
profits
for
gasoline
have
also
risen
significantly
since
late
last
month
as
the
market
shifted
to
fuel
and
sellers
cleared
their
backlog
of
winter
grades
industry
monitor
genscape
showed
a
spike
in
the
amount
of
gasoline
booked
to
sail
from
europe
to
west
africa
and
the
americas
in
the
week
to
march
rising
to
more
than
tonnes
for
the
former
and
more
than
tonnes
for
the
latter
but
analysts
said
the
owners
of
the
fuel
and
refineries
in
europe
could
run
into
trouble
if
demand
does
not
come
in
particularly
strong
over
the
summer
we
re
just
dealing
with
the
fact
that
there
is
a
fair
