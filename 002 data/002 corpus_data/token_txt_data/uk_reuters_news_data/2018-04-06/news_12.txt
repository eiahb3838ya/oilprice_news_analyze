environmental
protection
agency
head
scott
pruitt
held
more
meetings
with
industry
representatives
than
environmental
advocates
during
his
first
seven
months
in
office
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of
his
schedule
reflecting
the
agency
s
approach
under
his
tenure
the
newly
released
records
obtained
by
the
environmental
integrity
project
watchdog
group
through
a
freedom
of
information
act
request
come
as
the
white
house
probes
ethics
allegations
against
pruitt
these
include
his
rental
of
a
room
in
a
washington
condo
owned
by
the
wife
of
an
energy
industry
lobbyist
pruitt
a
vocal
doubter
of
mainstream
climate
change
science
has
also
faced
criticism
for
frequent
air
travel
spending
on
costly
items
in
his
office
including
a
soundproof
telephone
booth
and
for
a
trip
to
morocco
where
he
promoted
exports
of
liquefied
natural
gas
something
outside
the
remit
of
an
environmental
regulator
president
donald
trump
has
praised
pruitt
s
work
at
the
epa
for
aggressively
pursuing
his
agenda
to
roll
back
regulations
he
sees
as
unnecessary
to
pave
the
way
for
more
oil
gas
and
coal
production
and
remove
hurdles
for
a
revival
in
domestic
manufacturing
trump
on
thursday
said
pruitt
was
doing
a
fantastic
job
and
was
in
coal
and
energy
according
to
the
calendar
pruitt
met
with
representatives
of
the
industries
epa
regulates
at
least
times
from
to
making
up
about
percent
of
his
total
meetings
during
that
period
about
half
of
those
industry
meetings
were
with
representatives
of
the
oil
gas
coal
and
mining
industries
including
executives
from
companies
like
oil
major
bp
refining
giant
valero
energy
corp
coal
producer
murray
energy
and
miner
bhp
billiton
according
to
the
records
most
of
the
rest
of
the
industry
meetings
were
with
representatives
of
agriculture
including
farm
groups
like
the
national
cattlemen
s
association
and
biofuels
producers
like
growth
energy
and
poet
according
to
the
records
by
contrast
pruitt
met
only
four
times
with
environmental
groups
eager
to
see
the
epa
limit
pollution
from
those
industries
trout
unlimited
the
center
for
climate
and
energy
solutions
a
nonprofit
association
of
state
environmental
agency
leaders
called
ecos
and
the
alliance
to
restore
our
waterways
according
to
the
records
past
epa
administrators
have
been
criticized
for
spending
too
much
time
with
environmental
lobby
groups
and
too
little
with
industry
an
epa
spokesman
jahan
wilcox
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
about
the
balance
of
pruitt
s
meetings
liz
purchia
gannon
a
spokeswoman
for
former
epa
administrator
gina
mccarthy
who
served
under
president
barack
obama
said
the
ratio
of
pruitt
s
industry
to
environmental
group
meetings
was
a
contrast
to
the
ratio
of
meetings
mccarthy
held
mccarthy
met
frequently
with
utility
groups
while
the
agency
worked
to
form
the
clean
power
plan
obama
s
top
proposal
to
curb
greenhouse
gas
emissions
gannon
said
as
head
of
epa
she
always
met
with
environmental
and
public
health
groups
and
industry
and
business
leaders
she
believed
strongly
in
meeting
regularly
with
all
sides
said
gannon
who
did
not
provide
data
on
the
meetings
pruitt
also
held
a
number
of
meetings
with
conservative
policy
like
the
heritage
foundation
and
the
family
research
council
a
religious
group
that
argues
that
homosexual
conduct
is
harmful
to
society
according
to
the
records
a
portion
of
pruitt
s
schedule
covering
his
first
few
months
in
office
had
already
been
released
by
the
epa
but
the
latest
batch
covers
the
broadest
period
