many
delhi
residents
were
forced
to
spend
christmas
indoors
this
year
as
air
quality
remained
at
severe
to
emergency
levels
for
a
fourth
day
in
the
indian
capital
s
worst
smog
crisis
this
year
senior
officials
predicted
the
severe
pollution
would
last
another
three
days
due
to
unusually
stagnant
and
cold
air
they
issued
a
emergency
response
on
monday
that
included
closing
area
factories
and
banning
construction
works
we
are
preferring
to
stay
at
home
due
to
pollution
despite
christmas
celebrations
and
a
public
holiday
said
amit
azad
a
financial
consultant
he
bought
an
air
purifier
this
week
after
developing
a
cough
because
of
the
smog
a
delhi
government
official
blamed
the
pollution
for
traffic
on
already
streets
while
a
delhi
airport
official
said
some
domestic
and
international
flights
were
delayed
for
up

delhi
is
ranked
among
the
world
s
worst
cities
in
air
quality
after
years
of
breakneck
growth
in
auto
sales
and
power
generation
environmentalists
say
the
federal
and
city
governments
while
focusing
on
temporary
responses
are
more
effective
measures
that
would
hit
at
the
sources
of
pollution
and
promote
cleaner
fuels
there
is
a
lack
of
political
will
to
take
required
measures
on
a
sustained
basis
to
contain
pollution
levels
said
sunil
dahiya
a
senior
campaigner
with
greenpeace
india
he
called
for
higher
car
parking
fees
and
reduced
dependence
on
power
plants
dahiya
also
said
the
government
should
immediately
close
down
schools
and
urge
people
to
curtail
outdoor
activities
given
the
serious
health
effects
of
the
current
pollution
levels
