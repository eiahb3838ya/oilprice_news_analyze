iran
s
president

on

presented
a
billion
state
budget
with
increased
spending
on
lower
income
groups
saying
sanctions
would
affect
people
s
lives
and
economic
growth
but
not
bring
the
government
to
its
knees
president
donald
trump
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
a
multilateral
nuclear
deal
with
iran
in
may
and
reimposed
sanctions
on
it
including
on
its
vital
oil
industry
america
s
goal
is
to
bring
iran
s
islamic
system
to
its
knees
and
it
will
fail
in
this
but
sanctions
will
no
doubt
affect
people
s
lives
and
the
country
s
development
and
economic
growth
rouhani
told
parliament
in
a
speech
carried
live
on
state
television
he
gave
the
value
of
the
nominally
balanced
draft
budget
excluding
the
spending
of
state
enterprises
at
about
trillion
rials
for
the
next
iranian
year
which
starts
on
march
that
figure
is
up
from
about
trillion
rials
he
had
proposed
for
this
year
but
the
new
budget
is
effectively
worth
about
half
of
this
year
s
because
of
the
weakening
of
iran
s
currency
under
the
unofficial
exchange
rate
used
on
the
free
market
the
budget
is
worth
about
billion
rouhani
said
state
employees
and
pensioners
would
get
a
percent
pay
rise
next
year
and
the
budget
included
billion
at
a
subsidized
rate
less
than
half
of
the
market
to
provide
cheap
basic
goods
such
as
food
and
medicine
up
from
billion
in
this
year
s
budget
officials
have
said
the
budget
is
designed
to
provide
for
the
basic
needs
of
groups
including
state
employees
and
pensioners
and
to
support
production
and
employment
it
also
seeks
to
relaunch
thousands
of
stalled
state
projects
with
the
help
of
private
investors
the
draft
budget
has
to
be
passed
by
parliament
and
approved
by
a
clerical
body
that
vets
legislation
before
it
becomes
law
rouhani
called
for
trimming
the
state
sector
and
curbing
the
government
s
dependence
on
oil
income
which
is
forecast
at
trillion
rials
in
the
proposed
budget
officials
have
said
the
budget
calculations
were
based
on
a
forecast
crude
price
of
per
barrel
and
exports
of
to
million
barrels
per
day
down
from
a
peak
of
almost
million
bpd
in
if
the
private
sector
was
active
in
the
country
and
if
the
budget
did
not
rely
heavily
on
oil
the
impact
of
sanctions
would
have
been
much
less
rouhani
said
a
separate
draft
budget
for
state
companies
institutions
and
banks
allocates
them
a
total
of
billion
rouhani
s
speech
was
interrupted
by
parliament
members
