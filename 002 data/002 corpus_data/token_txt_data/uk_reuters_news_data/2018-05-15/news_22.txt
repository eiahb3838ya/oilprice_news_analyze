norway
postponed
a
final
decision
on
whether
to
go
ahead
with
a
project
to
develop
europe
s
first
industrial
carbon
capture
and
offshore
storage
ccs
project
after
dropping
one
of
its
participants
yara
international
the
government
said
on
tuesday
that
fertilizer
maker
yara
s
site
one
of
three
industrial
facilities
identified
for
the
project
was
not
suitable
and
the
project
as
a
whole
needed
to
be
more
cost
effective
governments
and
businesses
seeking
to
cut
carbon
emissions
have
long
cherished
the
idea
of
storing
in
the
ground
rather
than
emitting
it
the
norwegian
government
which
has
estimated
its
project
will
cost
up
to
billion
norwegian
crowns
billion
had
planned
to
decide
in
on
whether
to
invest
some
of
the
money
for
the
project
but
on
tuesday
put
that
decision
off
until
some
time
during
or
the
other
two
industrial
sites
identified
for
the
project
are
oslo
s
klemetsrud
plant
owned
by
finland
s
fortum
and
a
site
owned
by
norcem
a
subsidiary
of
heidelbergcement
the
government
also
said
on
tuesday
that
it
needed
more
time
to
decide
whether
to
grant
support
to
fortum
s
project
however
it
gave
norcem
s
site
the
green
light
saying
it
would
grant
million
crowns
million
for
norcem
s
project
to
capture
about
tonnes
of
emissions
per
year
the
government
said
yara
s
facility
was
unsuitable
due
to
uncertainty
about
the
plant
s
future
emissions
as
it
planned
to
replace
liquefied
petroleum
gas
lpg
with
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
as
its
raw
material
we
agree
with
the
government
s
conclusion
and
will
discontinue
the
project
a
spokeswoman
for
yara
said
the
international
energy
agency
iea
considers
ccs
technology
to
be
essential
to
limit
emissions
as
part
of
an
international
agreement
to
curb
global
warming
reached
in
paris
in
investments
in
the
project
at
norcem
s
cement
plant
were
estimated
at
billion
crowns
and
at
fortum
s
plant
at
billion
crowns
the
government
said
in
its
revised
fiscal
budget
plan
on
tuesday
it
said
that
while
estimates
by
external
consultants
atkins
and
oslo
economics
showed
the
overall
project
costs
to
be
too
high
to
make
it
profitable
for
society
the
government
would
continue
looking
for
a
solution
after
the
concept
studies
the
timeline
for
the
project
suggests
that
a
potential
investment
decision
may
be
taken
in
the
government
said
norway
s
oil
and
gas
industry
lobby
welcomed
the
decision
to
grant
support
to
norcem
but
said
more
capture
sites
were
needed
to
make
the
project
viable
both
the
lobby
group
and
a
top
trade
union
said
they
were
concerned
by
the
delay
in
the
government
s
decision
norway
aims
to
take
a
lead
in
developing
ccs
technology
as
well
as
the
project
oil
and
gas
firms
statoil
total
and

are
separately
studying
the
possibility
of
