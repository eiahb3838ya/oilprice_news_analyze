lava
flowing
from
giant
rips
in
the
earth
on
the
flank
of
hawaii
s
erupting
kilauea
volcano
threatened
highways
on
monday
raising
the
possibility
officials
may
order
thousands
more
people
to
evacuate
before
escape
routes
are
cut
off
lava
from
a
huge
new
fissure
tore
through
farmland
towards
a
coastal
dirt
road
that
is
one
of
the
last
exit
routes
for
some
residents
in
the
southeast
area
of
hawaii
s
big
island
more
cracks
are
expected
to
open
among
homes
and
countryside
some
miles
km
east
of
kilauea
s
smoking
summit
possibly
blocking

of
the

more

highway
the
hawaiian
volcano
observatory
said
mass
evacuations
would
be
triggered
if
either
highway
is
hit
by
lava
said
hawaii
national
guard
spokesman
jeff
hickman
there
s
a
lot
of
scenarios
and
roads
getting
blocked
is
one
of
them
said
hickman
standing
on
highway
in
the
potential
path
of
the
lava
flow
some
two
miles
km
away
dozens
of
homes
have
been
destroyed
since
eruptions
began
days
ago
and
officials
have
ordered
the
evacuations
of
nearly
residents
in
the
lower
puna
district
of
the
big
island
home
to
around
people
the
american
red
cross
said
people
sought
refuge
in
its
shelters
on
sunday
night
because
of
worsening
volcanic
activity
two
more
fissures
opened
in
the
past
hours
bringing
the
total
to
it
s
optimistic
to
think
that
this
is
the
last
fissure
we
re
going
to
see
said
hawaiian
volcano
observatory
deputy
steve
brantley
a
similar
seismic
event
in
lasted
days
he
said
unnerved
by
small
earthquakes
and
emissions
of
toxic
sulfur
dioxide
gas
rob
guzman
and
his
husband
bob
kirk
left
their
home
in
kalapana
seaview
estates
while
they
still
could
we
just
need
the
local
government
to
calm
down
the
panic
that
some
of
these
people
are
feeling
that
today
we
re
going
to
be
trapped
with
no
way
out
said
guzman
who
left
behind
a
banana
farm
and
rental
properties
to
go
stay
with
friends
the
hawaii
fire
department
issued
a
condition
red
alert
on
monday
because
fissures
in
the
southeast
area
of
the
lanipuna
gardens
area
were
issuing
high
levels
of
sulfur
dioxide
condition
red
means
immediate
danger
to
health
so
take
action
to
limit
further
exposure
severe
conditions
may
exist
such
as
choking
and
inability
to
breathe
the
department
said
in
the
alert
while
residents
deal
with
noxious
gas
and
lava
on
the
ground
the
geological
survey
is
concerned
that
steam
could
cause
a
violent
explosive
eruption
at
the
volcano
crater
launching
a
plume
that
could
spread
debris
over
miles
km
scientists
had
expected
such
explosions
by
the
middle
of
this
month
as
kilauea
s
lava
lake
fell
below
the
water
table
the
possibility
exists
however
that
water
may
not
be
entering
the
crater
as
feared
and
gas
and
steam
may
be
safely
venting
scientists
said
so
far
those
explosions
have
not
occurred
and
i
think
the
key
here
is
that
the
vent
system
is
an
open
one
therefore
pressure
is
not
being
built
or
developed
down
at
the
top
of
the
lava
column
