oil
futures
prices
have
soared
past
highs
opec
s
deal
has
cut
millions
of
barrels
of
inventory
worldwide
and
investors
are
betting
in
record
numbers
that
prices
could
rocket
past
and
even
hit
a
barrel
this
year
but
physical
markets
for
oil
shipments
tell
a
different
story
spot
crude
prices
are
at
their
steepest
discounts
to
futures
prices
in
years
due
to
weak
demand
from
refiners
in
china
and
a
backlog
of
cargoes
in
europe
sellers
are
struggling
to
find
buyers
for
west
african
russian
and
kazakh
cargoes
while
pipeline
bottlenecks
trap
supply
in
west
texas
and
canada
the
divergence
is
notable
because
traditionally
physical
markets
are
viewed
as
a
better
gauge
of
fundamentals
crude
traders
who
peddle
cargoes
to
refineries
worldwide
say
speculators
are
on
shaky
ground
as
they
drive
futures
markets
above
a
barrel
their
highest
levels
for
years
on
concerns
about
tighter
supply
from
venezuela
and
the
potential
impact
of
sanctions
on
supply
from
iran
investors
have
piled
millions
of
dollars
in
record
wagers
in
the
options
market
betting
on
a
further
rally
on
the
back
of
rising
geopolitical
tensions
particularly
in
iran
saudi
arabia
and
venezuela
and
the
global
decline
in
supply
guys
who
are
trading
futures
have
a
view
that
draws
are
coming
and
big
draws
are
coming
a
crude
trader
at
a
global
commodity
merchant
said
adding
that
demand
could
ramp
up
as
global
refinery
maintenance
ends
over
the
next
few
weeks
we
should
start
to
see
markets
globally
clean
up
but
if
that
doesn
t
happen
i
think
we
could
be
in
brent
the
benchmark
on
which
of
the
world
s
oil
is
priced
has
surpassed
a
barrel
the
highest
since
november
crude
futures
hit
a
high
just
short
of
inventories
in
the
developed
world
are
now
just
million
barrels
above
the
average
down
from
million
barrels
above
the
average
in
january
after
supply
cuts
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
other
producers
including
russia
in
the
last
few
weeks
expectations
that
president
donald
trump
would
withdraw
from
the
iran
nuclear
agreement
added
to
bullishness
following
trump
s
announcement
making
good
on
that
threat
last
week
prices
surged
further
analysts
estimate
anywhere
from
to
million
bpd
could
be
cut
from
global
exports
next
year
any
reduction
in
iranian
supply
will
likely
exacerbate
market
deficits
suggesting
upward
pressure
on
pricing
wrote
greg
sharenow
pimco
commodities
portfolio
manager
which
sees
oil
surpassing
in
the
short
term
in
the
weeks
before
trump
s
decision
hedge
funds
and
others
piled
a
record
number
of
bets
into
bullish
crude
oil
options
traders
currently
hold
a
record
million
barrels
worth
of
options
that
pay
off
if
the
december
brent
contract
hits
by
late
october
bets
that
crude
will
hit
a
barrel
by
are
currently
at
a
record
above
contracts
these
bets
are
being
made
due
to
strong
demand
not
just
fear
of
political
destabilization
said
scott
shelton
energy
futures
broker
with
icap
in
durham
north
carolina
the
bigger
picture
of
demand
keeping
up
with
supply
is
much
more
important
shelton
said
those
on
the
front
lines
of
the
physical
market
are
not
convinced
traders
say
the
surge
in
exports
to
more
than
million
bpd
has
saturated
some
markets
leaving
benchmark
prices
ripe
for
a
correction
there
is
a
huge
disconnect
between
futures
and
fundamentals
a
trader
with
a
chinese
independent
refiner
said
i
won
t
be
surprised
if
prices
correct
by
a
increased
competition
has
dented
sales
of
oil
from
nigeria
and
azerbaijan
which
produce
similar
quality
oil
and
compete
for
buyers
in
europe
and
latin
america
physical
prices
have
sunk
even
as
benchmarks
on
which
they
are
based
stay
buoyant
the
strength
of
brent
crude
now
trading
at
nearly
above
futures
and
above
dubai
has
made
it
hard
to
find
buyers
for
grades
priced
off
brent
russian
urals
hit
a
discount
against
dated
brent
while
kazakh
cpc
blend
crashed
to
its
weakest
since
this
month
separately
shipments
of
west
african
crude
to
asia
hit
a
low
in
april
due
to
a
backlog
at
chinese
ports
clogged
pipelines
have
hit
key
oil
grades
including
in
west
texas
where
the
discount
to
crude
is
near
its
widest
in
three
years
some
are
confident
the
world
s
refineries
will
gobble
up
these
barrels
when
they
finish
seasonal
maintenance
about
percent
of
china
s
refining
capacity
is
expected
to
be
offline
through
june
for
the
last
three
four
five
months
we
ve
seen
high
turnarounds
globally
a
crude
trader
said
referencing
maintenance
works
once
you
get
past
that
all
of
a
sudden
you
re
looking
at
million
barrels
per
day
of
fresh
crude
but
whether
that
is
enough
to
support
brent
at
and
above
is
yet
to
be
seen
i
think
it
s
touch
and
go
