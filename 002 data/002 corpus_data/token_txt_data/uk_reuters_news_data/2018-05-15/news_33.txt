stream
will
consist
of
two
pipelines
running
in
parallel
preparatory
works
are
in
accordance
with
the
stralsund
mining
authority
s
planning
approval
it
said
the
regulatory
authority
granted
the
consortium
a
permit
in
january
to
build
the
pipeline
in
german
territorial
waters
there
have
been
years
of
political
wrangling
over
whether
the
additional
route
to
bring
siberian
gas
to
germany
directly
from
next
year
is
in
europe
s
interest
economically
and
geopolitically
environmentalists
in
germany
and
finland
are
still
trying
to
halt
licensing
saying
authorities
should
take
more
care
the
pipeline
does
not
endanger
marine
life
the
consortium
has
said
it
will
mitigate
environmental
problems
while
arguing
for
the
economic
case
of
the
project
as
europe
will
need
more
imported
gas
in
future
nord
stream
of
an
identical
bcm
to
the
planned
new
pipeline
and
opened
in
has
proved
successful
it
says
the
nord
stream
project
has
said
it
will
tap
banks
for
financing
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
or
early
next
year
denmark
still
has
to
rule
whether
the
pipeline
can
be
built
near
its
coast
for
which
there
is
no
concrete
timing
other
routine
permissioning
processes
are
still
under
way
in
sweden
and
russia
gazprom
s
western
partners
are
energy
companies
uniper
wintershall
engie
austria

group
shell
poland
s
office
said
last
week
it
had
launched
proceedings
against
gazprom
and
the
five
european
firms
financing
nord
stream
over
a
potential
breach
of
laws
poland
sees
the
nord
stream
pipeline
which
would
double
russia
s
gas
export
capacity
via
the
baltic
sea
as
a
threat
to
europe
s
energy
security
and
argues
it
will
strengthen
gazprom
s
already
dominant
position
in
the
market
