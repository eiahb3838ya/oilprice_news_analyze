an
architect
of
the
paris
climate
agreement
urged
governments
on

to
halt
oil
exploration
in

saying
drilling
was
not
economical
and
warming
threatened
the
environmentally

region
christiana

formerly

change
secretariat
when
the
paris
accord
was
reached
by
almost
nations
in

reuters
by
telephone
the
arctic
has
been
rendered
the
past
three
years
have
been
the
hottest
since
records
began
in
the
century
and
figueres
said
the
heat
was
a
threat
to
everything
from
australia
s
great
barrier
reef
to
ice
in
antarctica
the
former
costa
rican
diplomat
who
campaigns
for
a
peak
in
global
emissions
by
said
it
made
no
economic
sense
to
explore
in
the
arctic
partly
because
it
was
likely
to
take
years
to
develop
any
finds
capital
investment
would
be
better
used
developing
renewable
energies
such
as
solar
and
wind
to
cut
emissions
she
said
the
stakes
are
visibly
higher
than
they
were
just
a
few
years
ago
she
said
figueres
will
give
a
speech
in
oslo
on
tuesday
at
the
business
for
peace
foundation
which
seeks
to
promote
ethical
business
practices
the
paris
agreement
sets
a
goal
of
ending
the
fossil
fuel
era
in
the
second
half
of
this
century
it
has
been
weakened
by
a
planned
pullout
by
president
donald
trump
who
doubts
mainstream
scientific
findings
that
global
warming
is
many
governments
and
companies
favour
arctic
drilling
last
month
trump
s
administration
began
environmental
reviews
for
oil
and
gas
drilling
in
a
section
of
the
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge
in
norway
statoil
and
other
companies
plan
to
keep
up
exploration
in
the
arctic
barents
sea
which
is
further
north
than
other
parts
of
the
arctic
thanks
to
the
warm
gulf
this
area
is
actually
less
challenging
in
terms
of
weather
and
waves
than
many
other
parts
of
norway
we
have
drilled
more
than
wells
and
never
had
any
significant
accidents
or
discharges
to
sea
statoil
spokesman
b√•rd
glad
pedersen
said
although
figueres
said
drilling
in
the
arctic
did
not
make
sense
pedersen
said
the
johan
castberg
field
due
to
start
pumping
in
the
early
off
north
norway
would
have
a
of
a
barrel
global
warming
is
also
making
the
arctic
shared
by
nordic
nations
russia
canada
and
the
united
states
more
accessible
to
shipping
and
mineral
exploration
