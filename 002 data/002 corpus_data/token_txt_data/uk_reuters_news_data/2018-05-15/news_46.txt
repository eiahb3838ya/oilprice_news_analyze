australian
gas
could
find
a
big
new
outlet
in
its
traditional
top
export
market
japan
as
the
country
pushes
to
switch
to
clean
hydrogen
fuel
the
chief
executive
of
woodside
petroleum
said
on
tuesday
woodside
ceo
peter
coleman
said
the
opportunity
was
huge
beyond
by
when
he
expected
hydrogen
fuel
to
be
in
production
in
large
volumes
worldwide
for
fuel
cells
that
could
power
cars
and
factories
japan
is
pushing
to
power
the
tokyo
olympics
in
with
hydrogen
as
part
of
a
long
term
drive
towards
a
hydrogen
economy
japanese
firms
are
working
on
pilot
projects
in
norway
and
australia
to
produce
hydrogen
fuel
using
wind
power
and
coal
it
s
a
game
changer
hydrogen
coleman
told
reporters
woodside
has
discussed
the
prospects
of
shipping
hydrogen
with
japan
s
chiyoda
corp
coleman
said
for
woodside
the
opportunity
would
be
to
use
gas
it
produces
off
western
australia
to
convert
to
ammonia
and
then
liquid
hydrogen
to
export
to
japan
it
makes
more
sense
to
produce
hydrogen
in
australia
and
then
ship
it
rather
than
sending
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
to
japan
to
make
hydrogen
as
the
production
process
requires
a
lot
of
energy
which
japan
is
short
on
coleman
said
woodside
is
looking
to
tap
the
abundant
sunshine
in
western
australia
s
pilbara
region
for
the
energy
needed
to
release
hydrogen
from
methane
as
a
first
step
the
company
is
considering
switching
its
north
west
shelf
lng
plant
to
be
powered
by
solar
energy
and
batteries
instead
of
gas
which
coleman
estimated
would
cost
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
that
would
be
justifiable
once
australia
s
oldest
and
largest
lng
plant
secures
gas
supply
to
keep
operating
beyond
it
makes
economic
sense
to
do
it
coleman
told
reporters
the
switch
would
free
up
more
gas
for
sale
and
would
also
have
environmental
benefits
as
percent
of
the
plant
s
carbon
emissions
currently
come
from
burning
gas
for
power
and
running
compressors
about
percent
of
gas
produced
for
the
north
west
shelf
plant
is
used
to
generate
power
and
run
compressors
at
the
plant
the
main
byproduct
from
producing
hydrogen
from
gas
would
be
carbon
which
woodside
could
decide
to
bury
or
use
for
other
purposes
such
as
carbon
fibre
