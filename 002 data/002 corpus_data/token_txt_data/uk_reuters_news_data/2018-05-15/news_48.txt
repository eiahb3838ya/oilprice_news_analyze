statoil to become equinor, dropping "oil" to attract young talent
oslo
reuters
shareholders
in
norway
s
largest
company
statoil
will
approve
on
tuesday
the
board
s
proposal
to
drop
oil
from
its
name
as
its
seeks
to
diversify
its
business
and
attract
young
talent
concerned
about
fossil
fuels
impact
on
climate
change
from
wednesday
the
majority
company
will
change
its
name
to
equinor
and
trade
on
the
oslo
exchange
under
the
new
ticker
eqnr
the
norwegian
government
which
has
a
percent
stake
in
the
firm
has
said
it
will
back
the
move
the
oil
and
gas
company
said
the
name
change
was
a
natural
step
after
it
decided
last
year
to
become
a
broad
energy
firm
investing
up
to
percent
of
annual
capital
expenditure
in
new
energy
solutions
by
mostly
in
offshore
wind
the
key
reason
for
a
company
to
change
its
name
is
when
it
wants
to
widen
the
scope
of
its
activity
or
direction
another
reason
would
be
because
it
is
in
trouble
and
it
has
a
reputational
problem
allyson
a
international
branding
expert
and
the
ceo
of
international
marketing
partners
told
reuters
i
don
t
believe
that
s
the
case
with
while
the
company
s
profits
are
growing
again
its
hydrocarbon
business
has
come
under
increased
scrutiny
after
the
paris
climate
deal
in
a
name
with
oil
as
a
component
would
increasingly
be
a
disadvantage
none
of
our
competitors
has
that
it
served
us
really
well
for
years
i
don
t
think
it
will
be
the
best
name
for
the
next
years

statoil
s
chief
executive
told
reuters
the
new
name
was
meant
to
arouse
curiosity
among
young
people
so
they
see
the
other
aspects
of
statoil
including
renewable
energy
he
added
technology
students
became
less
interested
in
working
for
oil
firms
after
oil
prices
crashed
in
and
renewable
energy
gained
in
prominence
statoil
ranked
in
an
annual
survey
of
the
nordic
country
s
most
attractive
employers
conducted
by
a
norwegian
careers
website
and
norwegian
firm
evidente
published
on
may
in
it
ranked
first
there
are
signs
however
that
the
name
change
could
help
it
climb
the
ranks
students
who
answered
the
survey
after
news
of
the
name
change
found
statoil
to
be
between
percent
and
percent
more
attractive
as
an
employer
arne
kvalsvik
at
evidente
said
it
s
likely
that
statoil
s
name
change
will
have
a
positive
impact
on
its
reputation
going
statoil
said
it
remained
the
first
choice
among
technology
students
citing
another
survey
by
swedish
firm
universum
truls
gulowsen
head
of
greenpeace
norway
said
the
name
change
would
not
be
sufficient
to
improve
statoil
s
image
as
long
as
the
firm
was
exploring
in
vulnerable
areas
such
as
the
arctic
or
the
great
australian
bight
