to
three
years
in
prison
for
his
role
in
a
carbon
emission
permit
trading
scheme
designed
to
curb
global
warming
but
used
to
fraudulently
collect
tens
of
millions
of
euros
of
sales
tax
the
ruling
by
the
federal
court
of
justice
affirmed
the
conviction
of
helmut
hohnholz
formerly
a
regional
sales
manager
with
deutsche
s
global
markets
division
the
court
also
backed
the
judgements
against
three
other
former
deutsche
bankers
who
two
years
ago
received
suspended
jail
sentences
the
case
of
one
former
employee
of
deutsche
s
tax
accounting
division
was
referred
back
to
lower
court
as
his
active
role
in
the
crime
could
not
be
fully
proven
the
case
stems
from
an
investigation
into
carousel
trades
in
the
european
union
s
carbon
market
in
and
in
which
some
buyers
imported
emissions
permits
into
one
eu
country
without
paying
tax
vat
the
buyers
sold
the
permits
designed
to
put
a
price
on
pollution
to
each
other
adding
vat
to
the
price
and
generating
tax
refunds
when
no

had
been
paid
european
police
agency
europol
has
estimated
the
cost
to
taxpayers
at
more
than
billion
euros
billion
pounds
since
hohnholz
had
been
accused
of
ignoring
all
question
marks
over
the
scheme
according
to
the
judge
presiding
the
trial
he
had
coordinated
the
trading
of
carbon
emissions
in
germany
for
deutsche
and
was
the
culprit
not
the
helper
in
collecting
million
euros
of
taxes
the
scheme
had
been
run
purely
to
trick
tax
authorities
out
of
a
total
of
million
euros
and
had
revealed
a
failure
of
all
security
mechanisms
at
deutsche
bank
the
judge
had
said
at
the
time
the
trial
followed
a
probe
that
involved
trawling
millions
of
emails
and
thousands
of
recorded
telephone
conversations
of
the
seven
former
deutsche
bank
employees
originally
on
trial
in
frankfurt
two
had
accepted
the
court
ruling
while
five
had
appealed
it
the
prosecutors
had
also
appealed
the
ruling
criticising
that
four
of
the
defendants
had
not
been
sentenced
as
culprits
but
only
as
accessories
to
the
tax
fraud
deutsche
bank
had
repaid
the
tax
changed
its
internal
processes
and
parted
with
the
staff
involved
it
declined
to
comment
on
tuesday
germany
s
flagship
lender
is
in
the
throes
of
a
major
restructuring
hamstrung
by
having
to
pay
out
billions
of
euros
of
fines
to
end
