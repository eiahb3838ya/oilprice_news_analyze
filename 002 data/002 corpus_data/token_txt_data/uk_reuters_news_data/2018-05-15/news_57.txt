their
latest
lift
as
opec
reported
that
the
global
oil
glut
has
been
virtually
eliminated
tensions
in
the
middle
east
and
uncertainty
about
output
from
iran
amid
renewed
sanctions
have
contributed
to
the
recent
rise
in
oil
prices
the
commitment
of
saudi
arabia
and
the
rest
of
opec
to
the
production
cuts
is
a
major
factor
in
supporting
the

at
the
moment
as
well
as
the
possibility
of
reduced
exports
from
iran
due
