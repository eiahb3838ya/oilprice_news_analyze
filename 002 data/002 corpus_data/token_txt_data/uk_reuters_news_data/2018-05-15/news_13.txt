a
boost
from

reported

were
absorbing
much
of
the
higher

pace
a

growth
is
taking

in
the
second
quarter
said
scott
anderson
chief

last

after

gasoline
building
materials
and
food
services

increasing
percent
in

these
core
retail
sales
correspond
most
closely
with
the
consumer
spending
component
of
gross
domestic
product
economists
estimated
that
consumer
spending
which
accounts
for
more
than
of
economic
activity
was
growing
at
a
percent
annualised
rate
early
in
the
second

consumer
spending
grew
at
a
percent
pace
in
the

which
was
the
slowest
in
nearly
five
years
the

expanded
at
a

rate
in

to
accelerate
to
a
percent
pace

said
its

rebounded
four
points
to
a
reading
of

the
rise
recouped
the
bulk
of
march
s
decline
in
the
index
the
survey
s
prices
paid
index
raced
to
its
highest
level
since
but
a
measure
of
prices
received
by
manufacturers
rose
marginally
stronger
consumer
spending
together
with
steadily
rising
inflation
support
economists
expectations
that
the

lifted
borrowing
costs
in
march
and
has
forecast
at

fell
with
the
yield
on
the
benchmark
note
rising
to
a
high
stocks
on
wall
street
were
weaker
economists
blamed
the
slowdown
in
consumer
spending
in
the
first
quarter
on
delays
in
processing
tax
refunds
they
also
said
efforts
in
the
wake
of
hurricanes
in
late
had
pulled
forward
spending
into
the
fourth
quarter
consumer
spending
is
being
supported
by
rising
wages
which
are
being
driven
by
a
robust
labour
market
while
lower
income
taxes
could
also
provide
a
boost
rising
gasoline
prices
could
blunt
some
of
the
stimulus
prices
at
the
pump
have
increased
about
cents
to
near
per
gallon
since
january
according
to
data
from
the
energy
information
administration
looking
ahead
the
consumer
now
faces
the
added
burden
of
higher
gasoline
prices

michael
feroli
an
economist
at
jpmorgan
in
new
york
with
crude
oil
prices
rising
after
president
donald
trump
s
decision
last
week
to
pull
the
united
states
out
of
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
