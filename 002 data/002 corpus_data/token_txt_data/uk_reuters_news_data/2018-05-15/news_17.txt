the
dollar
and

yields
jumped
on
tuesday
following
data
showing
a
rise
in
monthly
retail
sales
weighing
on
stocks
that
also
were
undercut
by
renewed
worries
over
global
trade

the

its

since

retail
sales
rose
moderately
in

as
rising

cut
into

appeared
on
track
to
accelerate
after

sharply
in
the

the

department
said
retail
sales
rose
percent
last
month
while

for

was
revised
up
to
show
sales
surging
percent
instead
of
the
previously
reported
percent
the
data
indicated
consumer
spending
is
stronger
than
expected
by
the
market
said
jon
mackay
investment
strategist
at
schroders
north
america
in
new

the
implication
is
that
means
inflation
has
more
upside
potential
which
means
the
fed
is
more
likely
than
not
to
hike

times

pricing
in

with
the

down

to
the

largely
due

the
