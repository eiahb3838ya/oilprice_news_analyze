new
york
may
reuters
republican
senator
chuck
grassley
on
tuesday
said
environmental
protection
agency
chief
scott
pruitt
must
scale
back
the
use
of
biofuels
waivers
for
small
refineries
or
else
he
will
join
other
lawmakers
calling
for
pruitt
s
resignation
the
demand
ramps
up
pressure
on
the
embattled
epa
administrator
who
is
already
under
pressure
from
mostly
democratic
lawmakers
to
step
down
over
controversies
that
include
high
spending
on
travel
and
security
corn
state
senators
like
iowa
s
grassley
have
been
infuriated
by
the
epa
s
decision
to
provide
an
unusually
large
number
of
waivers
to
refineries
in
recent
months
exempting
them
from
a
law
that
requires
biofuels
like
ethanol
be
mixed
into
the
nation
s
fuel
the
epa
has
authority
to
exempt
small
refineries
from
the
renewable
fuel
standard
if
they
can
prove
complying
would
cause
them
economic
hardship
but
biofuels
advocates
say
overusing
the
waivers
kills
demand
for
ethanol
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
messing
around
with
this
anymore
grassley
said
in
a
call
with
reporters
refering
to
the
epa
s
handling
of
biofuels
regulation
asked
if
he
thought
epa
would
scale
back
the
use
of
the
small
refinery
waivers
grassley
said
they
better
or
else
i
am
going
to
be
calling
for
pruitt
s
the
epa
has
said
its
criteria
for
approving
hardship
waivers
for
small
refineries
has
not
changed
from
past
years
several
democratic
lawmakers
have
called
on
pruitt
to
step
down
in
recent
weeks
but
president
donald
trump
has
thrown
his
support
behind
the
agency
chief
saying
he
is
doing
a
fantastic
job
rolling
back
hurdles
to
industry
trump
has
been
seeking
to
mediate
discussions
with
lawmakers
over
the
future
of
the
renewable
fuel
standard
in
recent
months
with
an
eye
toward
reducing
the
regulatory
cost
for
refiners
without
undermining
ethanol
demand
trump
told
lawmakers
in
a
meeting
last
week
that
he
had
decided
to
do
so
by
expanding
sales
of
gasoline
called
counting
ethanol
exports
toward
annual
volumes
quotas
and
cutting
back
the
use
of
waivers
according
to
a
source
briefed
on
the
meeting
the
corn
lobby
supports
expanding
sales
of
and
reducing
the
waiver
program
but
opposes
counting
exports
toward
volume
quotas
the
oil
industry
meanwhile
is
resisting
the
expansion
of
because
it
worries
the
move
will
cut
petroleum
s
share
of
the
fuel
market
and
supports
both
the
waivers
and
the
export
tweak
as
ways
of
cutting
regulatory
costs
