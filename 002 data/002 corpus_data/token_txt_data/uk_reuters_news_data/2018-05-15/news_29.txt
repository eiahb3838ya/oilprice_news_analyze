exclusive-as venezuelans suffer, maduro buys foreign oil to subsidize cuba
houston
may
reuters
venezuela
s
oil
firm
pdvsa
has
bought
nearly
million
worth
of
foreign
crude
and
shipped
it
directly
to
cuba
on
friendly
credit
terms
and
often
at
a
loss
according
to
internal
company
documents
reviewed
by
reuters
the
shipments
are
the
first
documented
instances
of
the
opec
nation
buying
crude
to
supply
regional
allies
instead
of
selling
them
oil
from
its
own
vast
reserves
venezuela
made
the
discounted
deliveries
which
have
not
been
previously
reported
despite
its
dire
need
for
foreign
currency
to
bolster
its
collapsing
economy
and
to
import
food
and
medicine
amid
widespread
shortages
the
oil
purchases
to
subsidize
one
of
venezuela
s
few
remaining
allies
underscores
its
increasing
global
isolation
and
the
disintegration
of
its
energy
sector
under
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
the
purchases
came
as
venezuela
s
crude
production
hit
a
low
in
the
first
quarter
down
percent
in
months
its
refineries
are
operating
at
a
third
of
capacity
and
its
workers
are
resigning
by
the
thousands
for
a
graphic
on
venezuela
rising
oil
imports
and
falling
exports
see
pdvsa
bought
the
crude
for
up
to
per
barrel
more
than
it
priced
the
same
oil
when
it
shipped
to
cuba
according
to
prices
on
internal
documents
reviewed
by
reuters
but
cuba
may
never
pay
cash
for
the
cargoes
because
venezuela
has
long
accepted
goods
and
services
from
cuba
in
return
for
oil
under
a
pact
signed
in
by
late
presidents
hugo
chavez
and
fidel
castro
pdvsa
the
venezuela
government
and
the
cuba
government
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
venezuela
s
government
has
previously
said
it
only
imports
oil
to
blend
with
its
own
crude
to
improve
quality
and
create
an
exportable
product
or
to
feed
its
refinery
in
curacao
but
hundreds
of
pdsva
documents
examined
by
reuters
detailing
imports
and
exports
dated
from
january
to
may
of
this
year
show
the
company
is
now
buying
crude
at
market
prices
to
deliver
to
allies
in
shipments
that
never
pass
through
venezuela
the
subsidized
deliveries
are
aimed
at
maintaining
political
support
from
cuba
one
of
a
dwindling
group
of
venezuela
allies
according
to
diplomats
politicians
and
pdvsa
executives
maduro
is
giving
away
everything
he
can
because
these
countries
backing
especially
from
cuba
is
all
the
political
support
he
has
left
said
a
former
top
venezuelan
government
official
who
declined
to
be
identified
caracas
has
come
under
increasing
international
pressure
as
the
united
states
the
european
union
and
canada
have
sanctioned
venezuela
for
what
they
see
as
maduro
s
attempts
to
cement
a
dictatorship
as
venezuela
spends
on
oil
imports
it
has
imported
less
of
everything
else
its
citizens
desperately
need
venezuela
s
spending
on
imports
plunged
from
nearly
billion
in
to
billion
in
according
venezuela
central
bank
data
and
ecoanalitica
a
economic
research
organization
the
oil
pdvsa
procured
for
cuba
was
russian
urals
crude
the
documents
show
a
variety
for
cuban
refineries
constructed
from
equipment
pdvsa
bought
the
crude
from
chinese
russian
and
swiss
firms
not
for
cash
but
a
pledge
that
pdvsa
would
deliver
other
oil
shipments
later
the
documents
show
that
adds
to
venezuela
s
already
towering
debts
of
oil
to
firms
in
russia
and
china
which
together
have
extended
venezuela
s
government
more
than
billion
in
deals
that
have
propped
up
its
budget
amid
declining
exports
and
lower
oil
prices
it
s
nonsense
to
import
oil
to
keep
subsidized
exports
flowing
said
ecoanalitica
president
asdrubal
oliveros
venezuela
s
socialist
government
has
long
used
oil
for
domestic
and
international
political
ends
subsidizing
goods
and
services
at
home
and
currying
favor
across
the
region
with
oil
deliveries
on
generous
terms
venezuela
s
oil
supply
arrangements
have
helped
soften
international
political
censure
of
maduro
s
government
the
organization
of
american
states
oas
which
includes
most
western
hemisphere
nations
last
year
took
up
a
motion
seeking
to
pressure
venezuela
to
hold
free
elections
liberate
political
prisoners
and
declare
a
humanitarian
crisis
the
effort
was
defeated
when
countries
that
have
received
regular
oil
shipments
from
venezuela
in
recent
years
about
a
third
of
the
oas
membership
opposed
it
or
refused
to
vote
eventually
the
oas
passed
a
motion
urging
free
and
fair
elections
venezuela
has
avoided
formal
oas
condemnation
thanks
to
the
support
of
the
bloc
of
caribbean
nations
that
have
benefited
from
its
subsidized
oil
and
development
programs
for
years
said
michael
fitzpatrick
deputy
assistant
secretary
in
the
state
department
s
bureau
of
western
hemisphere
affairs
said
on
april
during
a
talk
at
the
atlantic
council
a
foreign
policy
think
tank
in
washington
most
of
those
countries
are
members
of
venezuela
s
petrocaribe
trade
pact
launched
in
which
has
granted
up
to
caribbean
and
central
american
states
with
oil
supplies
on
favorable
terms
oas
president
luis
almagro
declined
to
comment
through
press
office
representative
monica
reyes
el
salvador
s
economy
minister
luz
estrella
rodriguez
said
petrocaribe
and
other
pacts
promoted
by
venezuela
had
played
an
important
role
in
her
country
s
development
our
country
is
very
grateful
she
said
the
government
of
el
salvador
of
course
is
a
friend
and
an
ally
of
the
venezuelan
el
salvador
refused
to
vote
last
year
on
the
oas
motion
to
condemn
venezuela
venezuela
also
supplied
fuel
last
year
to
nicaragua
the
dominican
republic
haiti
and
dominica
the
documents
show
in
total
members
of
oil
trade
pacts
with
venezuela
last
year
received
at
least
bpd
of
crude
and
refined
products
from
pdvsa
the
documents
show
or
about
percent
of
venezuela
s
exports
the
falling
output
of
venezuela
s
refineries
has
also
left
the
country
increasingly
dependent
on
fuel
imports
to
meet
domestic
consumption
the
internal
pdvsa
data
reviewed
by
reuters
shows
venezuela
last
year
purchased
some
barrels
per
day
of
foreign
crude
and
refined
products
from
petrochina
rosneft
lukoil
reliance
industries
and
other
suppliers
percent
more
than
in
those
companies
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
the
purchases
totaled
more
billion
according
to
pdvsa
records
last
year
total
purchases
including
equipment
and
services
consumed
percent
of
venezuela
s
total
import
spending
up
from
percent
in
ecoanalitica
data
shows
energy
imports
totaled
billion
out
of
billion
the
resulting
scarcity
of
food
medicine
and
employment
has
caused
thousands
of
citizens
to
flee
venezuela
the
pay
of
pdvsa
workers
now
can
t
cover
the
barest
essentials
because
of
the
collapse
of
its
currency
the
bolivar
a
worker
s
salary
is
not
even
enough
for
a
box
of
eggs
said
hector
bertis
a
pdvsa
worker
and
union
leader
we
go
to
the
bank
and
they
give
us
bolivars
less
than
what
a
transportation
fare
