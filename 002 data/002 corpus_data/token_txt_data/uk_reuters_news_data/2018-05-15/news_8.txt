the
yield
on
the
benchmark
treasury
note
hit
its
highest
point
in
about
seven
years
on
tuesday
on
the
heels
of
a
report
that
indicated
a
pick
up
in
consumer
spending
pushing
the
dollar
to
its
highest
level
this
year
and
weighing
on
stocks
the
yield
neared

blowing
through
the
key
psychological
level
of
percent
it
hit
in
late
april
for
the
first
time
in
four
years
wall
street
s
main
indexes
slumped
with
investors
concerned
that
rising
bond
yields
would
hurt
stock
valuations
the
dollar
s
rise
also
helped
pushed
down
gold
to
its
low
point
for
the
year
data
showed
that
retail
sales
rose
moderately
in
april
as
higher
gasoline
prices
cut
into
discretionary
spending
but
consumer
spending
appeared
on
track
to
accelerate
after
slowing
sharply
in
the
first
quarter
the
commerce
department
said
retail
sales
rose
percent
last
month
while
data
for
march
was
revised
up
to
show
sales
surging
percent
instead
of
the
previously
reported
percent
the
data
indicated
consumer
spending
is
stronger
than
expected
by
the
market
said
jon
mackay
investment
strategist
at
schroders
north
america
in
new
york
the
implication
is
that
means
inflation
has
more
upside
potential
which
means
the
fed
is
more
likely
than
not
to
hike
four
times
this
year
versus
what
the
market
was
pricing
in
a
month
ago
which
is
two
to
three
times

the
reason
why

today
is
because
we

frictions
a
little
bit
of

are
related
to
a
