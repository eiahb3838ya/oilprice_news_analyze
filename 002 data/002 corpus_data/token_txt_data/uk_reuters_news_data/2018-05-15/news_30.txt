financing
set
up
by
european
countries
to
trade
with
iran
will
not
be
enough
to
sustain
economic
ties
with
tehran
in
the
face
of
sanctions
an
adviser
to
the
french
president
said
on
tuesday
following
washington
s
withdrawal
from
the
iran
nuclear
agreement
last
week
europe
needs
a
more
global
approach
to
reinforce
our
legal
arsenal
and
defend
companies
doing
business
with
countries
under
unilateral
sanctions
the
elysee
official
said
during
a
briefing
for
reporters
in
paris
business
leaders
met
french
officials
on
tuesday
as
president
emmanuel
macron
s
government
presses
washington
for
waivers
covering
companies
such
as
airbus
sanofi
renault
and
psa
group
many
have
reinvested
in
iran
since
the
accord
which
suspended
sanctions
in
return
for
curbs
on
tehran
s
nuclear
programmes
france
italy
and
germany
are
among
countries
that
had
set
up
export
mechanisms
designed
to
avoid
dollar
transactions
and
thereby
withstand
an
anticipated
renewal
of
sanctions
but
france
s
scheme
administered
by
the
bpifrance
sovereign
fund
was
recently
put
on
hold
sources
have
said
it
s
important
that
we
develop
mechanisms
allowing
us
to
counter
extraterritorial
laws
and
a
financing
vehicle
such
as
the
bpi
s
is
part
of
that
the
senior
adviser
said
but
iran
is
a
particularly
tough
case
and
i
m
not
sure
the
bpi
programme
alone
will
allow
big
companies
to
go
and
invest
in
a
second
french
official
said
it
was
not
clear
how
much
appetite
there
would
be
for
financing
tools
from
companies
in
iran
we
don
t
have
much
with
which
to
threaten
the
americans
when
you
re
an
economic
player
and
a
multinational
with
interests
in
the
united
states
that
works
in
dollars
you
have
a
choice
and
that
choice
is
made
