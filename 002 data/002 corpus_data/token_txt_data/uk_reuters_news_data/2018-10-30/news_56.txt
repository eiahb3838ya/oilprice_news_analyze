the
is

an

and

fail

war
between
the

largest
economies
oil
was
also
being
weighed
down
by
signs
of
rising
supply
from
top
producers
a
saudi
pledge
to
produce
as
much
oil
as
possible
and
the
stock
market
rout
have
sharply
reduced
concerns
about
the
implementation
of
sanctions
against
iran
said
ole
hansen
head
of
commodity
strategy
at
saxo
bank
russia
has
also
indicated
that
it
will
provide
enough
oil
to
meet
demand
once
sanctions
hit
iran
from
next
week
in
a
sign
that
oil
supply
remains
ample
despite
the
looming
sanctions
against
iran

crude
output
from
the
world

top
producers

reached

s
an
increase
of
million
bpd
since
the
start
of
the
decade
and
means
that
these
three
producers
alone
now
meet
a
third
of
global
crude
demand
despite
that
hansen
said
given
the
yet
unknown
impact
on
iran
s
ability
to
produce
and
export
amid
sanctions
we
could
see
some
speculative
buying
emerge
ahead
of
iran
s
seaborne
crude
exports

fallen
from
a
of
