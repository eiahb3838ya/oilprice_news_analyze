reuters summit-vitol sees oil prices falling as demand growth falters
london
reuters
oil
prices
will
likely
fall
next
year
as
demand
is
curbed
by
trade
wars
and
weakness
in
emerging
market
economies
the
world
s
biggest
oil
trader
vitol
predicted
on
tuesday
chief
executive
russell
hardy
told
the
reuters
commodities
summit
that
vitol
had
revised
down
its
forecast
for
oil
demand
growth
next
year
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
from
million
previously
it
also
cut
this
year
s
forecast
to
million
from
million
we
have
never
been
we
have
always
had
an
expectation
that
high
prices
would
dent
demand
hardy
said
in
his
first
interview
since
becoming
ceo
in
march
crude
markets
are
not
that
tight
in
the
immediate
term
and
a
fair
price
of
oil
going
into
next
year
is
probably
closer
to
the
or
per
barrel
mark
than
the
area
that
some
people
are
talking
oil
prices
jumped
above
per
barrel
earlier
this
month
on
fears
of
a
steep
decline
in
iranian
supply
as
sanctions
on
tehran
come
into
force
on
hardy
said
he
saw
iranian
oil
exports
declining
but
not
as
sharply
as
previously
feared
probably
sticking
above
million
bpd
because
china
india
and
turkey
were
likely
to
continue
buying
crude
from
tehran
combined
with
softer
demand
this
should
help
keep
the
oil
market
in
balance
for
the
first
half
of
next
year
provided
saudi
arabia
pumped
near
volumes
and
the
world
avoided
another
major
supply
disruption
hardy
said
there
s
not
much
room
for
things
to
go
wrong
in
any
supply
sense
because
there
is
pretty
much
no
spare
capacity
at
the
moment
he
said
a
potential
worsening
of
the
environment
represents
a
risk
to
the
downside
if
demand
worsened
further
it
could
add
downward
pressure
on
prices
because
it
would
come
just
as
the
united
states
adds
more
oil
to
the
market
in
the
second
half
of
however
the
second
part
of
would
also
see
the
market
switching
focus
to
tighter
marine
fuel
rules
coming
into
force
in
which
are
expected
to
give
a
major
boost
to
diesel
demand
said
hardy
the
market
is
going
to
forgive
oversupply
based
on
a
view
of
increased
demand
for
distillates
in
he
said
hardy
also
said
he
thought
opec
was
unlikely
to
add
supply
to
the
market
at
its
next
meeting
in
december
despite
calls
from
president
donald
trump
to
help
bring
prices
down
in
the
end
opec
produces
million
bpd
and
they
don
t
have
a
great
deal
more
supply
to
give
the
market
some
parties
within
opec
are
beginning
to
think
they
need
to
be
a
little
bit
more
conservative
about
because
of
the
amount
of
increasing
production
the
united
states
is
expected
to
add
a
new
wall
of
supply
next
year
and
those
volumes
would
be
a
major
driver
behind
vitol
s
own
expansion
in
crude
refined
products
and
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
markets
hardy
said
we
re
trying
to
position
ourselves
to
make
sure
that
we
re
getting
some
of
that
flow
and
that
we
re
participating
in
those
exports
because
the
is
about
to
embark
on
another
massive
expansion
of
its
crude
oil
export
capacity
said
hardy
vitol
traded
over
million
bpd
of
crude
and
products
in
and
hardy
said
the
figure
would
edge
up
in
lng
traded
volumes
for
this
year
are
expected
to
be
around
million
tonnes
from
