and
greece
over
jurisdiction
attempts
to
tap
gas
and
oil
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
along
with
a
dispute
over
greece
s
maritime
borders
have
recently
caused
friction
between
athens
and
ankara
turkey
and
the
internationally
recognised
greek
cypriot
government
in
cyprus
have
overlapping
claims
of
jurisdiction
for
offshore
oil
and
gas
research
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
a
region
thought

drilling
ship

said
it

kilometres
miles
off

and
kilometres
off
antalya
s
alanya
district
turkey
has
set
its
main
goal
as
independence
in
energy
donmez
said
we
don
t
have
an
eye
on
others
resources
our
only
issue
is
to
present
to
our
people
the
riches
within
our
the
first
borehole
will
be
some
distance
from
the
disputed
territory
which
lies
further
south
and
around
cyprus
turkey
is
almost
completely
reliant
on
imports
to
meet
its
energy
needs
and
the
lira
s
tumble
against
the
dollar
this
year
has
driven
up
that
cost
putting
pressure
on
energy
companies
to
raise
prices
for
consumers
to
meet
more
of
its
needs
domestically
turkey
recently
announced
a
tender
for
operation
rights
of
three
new
solar
power
plants
and
privatised
seven
coal
fields
it
also
opened
a
new
refinery
to
reduce
dependence
on
imported
oil
products
donmez
said
on
tuesday
that
turkey
was
also
very
close
to
buying
another
drilling
ship
turkey
warned
greece
last
week
to
stay
out
of
its
activities
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
heralding
a
potential
showdown
with
cyprus
breakaway
north
cyprus
which
is
supported
by
turkey
says
any
offshore
wealth
also
belongs
to
them
as
partners
in
the
establishment
of
the
cyprus
republic
in
greek
cypriots
who
run
the
island
s
internationally
recognised
government
say
any
future
benefits
of
gas
finds
will
eventually
be
shared
by
all
cypriots
the
island
was
split
in
after
a
turkish
invasion
triggered
by
a
brief
coup
countless
peacemaking
endeavours
have
failed
and
offshore
wealth
has
increasingly
complicated
peace
negotiations
even
though
greek
cypriots
say
that
matter
is
not
up
for
discussion
