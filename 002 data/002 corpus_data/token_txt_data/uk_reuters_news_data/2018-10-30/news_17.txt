two

said
on
tuesday
even
though
the
company
remains
in
default
on
most
of
its
outstanding
debt
during
a
hyperinflationary
economic
crisis
the
government
of
president
nicolas
maduro
has
halted
payment
on
nearly
all
of
venezuela
and
the
company
s
billion
in
outstanding
debt
but
has
stayed
current
on
the
issue
that
is
backed
by
shares
in
refining
subsidiary
citgo
investors
had
broadly
expected
pdvsa
as
the
company
is
known
to
make
the
million
interest
and
principal
payment
to
avoid
losing
control
of
citgo
which
is
already
the
target
of
a
dispute
by
other
creditors
seeking
to
collect
from
the
opec
nation
pdvsa
did
not
immediately
respond
to
an
email
seeking
comment
two
bondholders
contacted
by

said
they
had
seen
the

their
accounts
three
others
said
they

not

received
word
that
clearing

financial
institutions
that
intermediate
bond
payments
had
gotten
the
money
yes
they
are
paying
but
at
pdvsa
speed
said
one
investor
in
reference
to
the
company
s
tendency
to
settle
bills
well
after
their
due
date
the
investors
requested
anonymity
because
they
were
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
about
the
matter
two
pdvsa
sources
said
the
company
had
sent
the
payment
which
had
been
approved
by
management
two
weeks
ago
and
attributed
the
delays
to
compliance
procedures
by
international
banks
venezuelan
and
pdvsa
are
behind
on
bond
payments
by
some
billion
the
government
of
president
nicolas
maduro
blames
the
problem
on
financial
sanctions
imposed
last
year
critics
say
selective
payment
of
certain
bonds
illustrates
that
the
government
can
pay
when
it
has
an
incentive
to
do
so
but
uses
sanctions
as
an
excuse
when
it
does
not
failing
to
pay
the
bond
would
allow
bondholders
to
seize
half
the
shares
of
citgo

canadian
miner
crystallex
has
already
won
approval
from
a
judge
to
auction
shares
of
a
pdvsa
holding
company
that
indirectly
controls
citgo
in
order
to
collect
billion
in
compensation
for
the
nationalization
of
its
assets
a
decade
ago
