kuwait
needs
to
push
through
economic
reforms
despite
higher
oil
prices
the
gulf
state
s
ruler
said
on
tuesday
urging
parliament
to
work
with
the
government
to
implement
measures
aimed
at
diversifying
revenues
and
developing
the
economy
kuwait
whose
state
finances
are
among
the
strongest
in
the
region
has
been
trying
to
introduce
new
taxes
and
reform
a
lavish
welfare
system
to
curb
state
spending
i
hope
that
the
recent
temporary
improvement
in
oil
prices
does
not
obstruct
this
important
path
which
aims
to
protect
future
generations
emir
sheikh
sabah
told
parliament
in
a
speech
at
the
start
of
its
new
session
critics
say
parliament
has
long
hindered
attempts
at
fiscal
discipline
the
current
parliament
elected
in
late
has
yet
to
pass
any
major
elements
of
government
reforms
introduced
after
oil
prices
plunged
in
parliament
s
budget
committee
said
last
may
that
kuwait
would
not
implement
a
tax
before
but
would
push
ahead
this
year
with
excise
taxes
on
selected
products
such
as
tobacco
and
sugary
drinks
the
gulf
s
six
countries
originally
agreed
to
introduce
a
percent
vat
at
the
start
of
and
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
did
so
the
other
states
have
delayed
because
of
political
opposition
potential
damage
to
consumer
spending
and
the
technical
challenges
of
a
new
tax
the
gulf
economies
including
kuwait
s
are
likely
to
accelerate
in
coming
years
as
governments
boost
spending
but
growth
will
not
return
to
the
levels
enjoyed
before
oil
prices
fell
in
a
quarterly
reuters
poll
of
economists
found
kuwait
has
the
most
powerful
parliament
in
the
region
but
a
series
of
assemblies
have
been
dissolved
in
recent
years
amid
power
struggles
between
the
opposition
and
the
cabinet
which
is
dominated
by
the
ruling
family
i
will
not
allow
us
to
stray
from
the
blessing
of
democracy
to
a
curse
that
threatens
stability
in
our
country
the
emir
said
criticising
what
he
described
as
a
feverish
race
by
some
mps
to
question
ministers
the
assembly
can
pass
legislation
and
question
ministers
but
the
emir
has
the
final
say
in
state
matters
he
picks
a
prime
minister
who
selects
a
cabinet
