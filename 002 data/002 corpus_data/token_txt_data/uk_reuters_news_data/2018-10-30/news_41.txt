high
oil
prices
are
hurting
consumers
and
could
also
have
adverse
implications
for
producers
the
executive
director
of
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
on
tuesday
major
emerging
asian
economies
such
as
india
and
indonesia
have
been
hit
hard
this
year
by
rising
crude
oil
prices
which
despite
declining
this
month
are
still
up
by
about
percent
since
the
start
of
fuel
import
costs
have
been
pushed
up
further
by
a
slide
in
emerging
market
currencies
against
the
dollar
denting
growth
and
even
triggering
protests
and
government
fuel
price
controls
in
india
many
countries
current
account
deficits
have
been
affected
by
high
oil
prices
iea
chief
fatih
birol
said
at
an
energy
conference
in
singapore
there
are
two
downward
pressures
on
global
oil
demand
growth
one
is
high
oil
prices
and
in
many
countries
they
re
directly
related
to
consumer
prices
the
second
one
is
global
economic
growth
momentum
slowing
the
effect
of
high
oil
prices
will
be
compounded
in
southeast
asia
as
demand
is
rising
fast
but
production
is
falling
resulting
in
the
region
becoming
a
net
importer
of
oil
gas
and
coal
birol
said
despite
the
possibility
of
a
slowdown
birol
said
the
general
outlook
for
fuel
consumption
was
for
continued
growth
while
the
rise
of
electric
vehicles
is
expected
to
result
in
peak
demand
for
products
like
diesel
and
gasoline
within
coming
years
a
consumption
boom
in
products
such
as
plastic
as
well
as
fuel
demand
growth
from
aviation
have
triggered
refinery
investment
into
petrochemical
products
and
high
quality
products
like
jet
fuel
global
oil
demand
will
continue
to
grow
even
amid
the
rise
of
electric
vehicles
as
they
are
governed
by
petrochemicals
aviation
among
others
he
said
bhp
billiton
the
world
s
biggest
miner
which
has
oil
and
gas
assets
but
also
hopes
to
benefit
from
the
demand
for
raw
materials
coming
from
batteries
for
electric
vehicles
ev
also
said
oil
demand
would
still
grow
despite
the
rise
of
evs
bhp
s
chief
commercial
officer
arnoud
balhuizen
said
on
tuesday
during
a
conference
in
melbourne
that
oil
demand
will
increase
by
percent
a
year
on
average
over
the
next
to
years
there
will
be
substitution
coming
on
the
back
of
an
increased
pickup
of
electric
vehicles
but
even
if
we
plug
in
the
most
ambitious
electric
vehicle
trends
in
our
forecasting
we
continue
to
see
oil
demand
on
the
back
of
other
sectors
he
said
to
meet
the
percent
per
year
consumption
growth
balhuizen
said
quite
a
bit
of
new
capital
needs
to
be
allocated
to
the
oil
industry
in
the
next
five
to
ten
years
to
be
able
to
meet
that
more
so
than
oil
birol
said
demand
for
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
would
boom
he
said
that
global
lng
trade
could
pass
billion
cubic
meters
per
day
bcm
by
growing
by
a
third
in
the
coming
five
years
bhp
s
balhuizen
echoed
this
in
melbourne
saying
lng
is
a
commodity
with
very
strong
demand
birol
said
just
three
countries
qatar
australia
and
the
united
states
would
supply
percent
of
global
lng
by
lng
demand
is
primarily
driven
by
growth
in
china
where
an
program
is
driving
a
massive
shift
from
coal
to
natural
gas
but
demand
is
also
expected
to
grow
fast
in
southeast
asia
where
birol
said
the
power
sector
needed
billion
of
investment
by
more
than
twice
the
current
level
to
keep
up
with
consumption
despite
this
growth
potential
the
lng
sector
faces
increasing
competition
from
renewables
and
storage
technology
which
are
cleaner
than
fossil
fuels
and
becoming
much
cheaper
in
many
countries
birol
said
solar
power
was
on
track
to
become
the
cheapest
source
of
new
electricity
