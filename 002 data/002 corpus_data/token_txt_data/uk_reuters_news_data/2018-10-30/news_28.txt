eu should brace for u.s. standoff over china, ex-wto chief warns
paris
reuters
the
european
union
should
prepare
for
its
companies
to
be
targeted
by
american
sanctions
in
a
worsening
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
former
world
trade
organisation
wto
director
general
pascal
lamy
said
on
tuesday
as
they
weigh
up
a
response
to
renewed
sanctions
against
iran
which
have
forced
an
exodus
of
european
companies
eu
governments
should
consider
the
prospect
of
similar
extraterritorial
measures
penalising
china
trade
lamy
told
an
international
investment
conference
in
paris
if
the
were
to
step
further
in
not
only
hitting
china
with
trade
measures
but
with
sanctions
if
they
were
to
deal
with
china
the
way
they
did
with
iran
then
we
would
all
have
a
big
problem
he
said
that
s
why
we
need
to
have
a
careful
look
at
what
will
happen
in
the
case
of
a
surge
in
global
protectionism
from
brexit
to
the
trade
war
has
done
little
to
dent
foreign
direct
investment
flows
overall
according
to
data
presented
to
the
xbma
conference
on
mergers
and
acquisitions
the
global
volume
of
m
a
deals
is
projected
to
rise
percent
this
year
to
trillion
its
annual
total
since
the
eve
of
the
last
major
financial
crisis
chinese
investors
accounted
for
a
record
percent
of
european
inbound
deal
volume
last
year
as
some
turned
their
attention
away
from
the
united
states
trade
is
also
expected
to
benefit
from
increased
tariffs
and
other
barriers
the
trump
administration
in
may
withdrew
washington
from
an
international
agreement
to
curb
tehran
s
nuclear
activities
and
imposed
new
sanctions
against
iran
that
triggered
the
mass
withdrawal
of
european
companies
from
carmakers
to
oil
majors
in
order
to
avoid
crippling
penalties
reintroduced
in
stages
on
and
european
governments
have
pledged
in
response
to
establish
new
financing
channels
that
shield
companies
from
sanctions
but
a
viable
programme
has
yet
to
emerge
the
comments
by
lamy
who
served
as
eu
trade
commissioner
before
heading
the
wto
expanded
on
recommendations
published
in
a
policy
paper
here
last
week
by
the
jacques
delors
institute
a
european
europe
could
create
its
own
extraterritorial
mechanisms
to
sanction
breaches
of
environmental
data
protection
tax
and
laws
according
to
the
paper
by
lamy
and
four
others
including
louis
schweitzer
honorary
chairman
of
carmaker
renault
failing
that
brussels
could
use
existing
directives
to
halt
the
eu
activities
of
foreign
banks
from
a
third
country
that
imposes
extraterritorial
provisions
on
eu
companies
it
said
it
can
not
be
ruled
out
that
the
united
states
will
impose
future
sanctions
on
china
that
go
beyond
the
current
trade
measures
initiated
by
the
american
president
which
could
then
be
applied
extraterritorially
the
paper
added
perhaps
it
would
be
wise
to
take
decisions
for
the
iranian
case
by
considering
this
wider
economic
and
political
