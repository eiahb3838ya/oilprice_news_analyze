rising u.s. crude output sparks race to build export terminals
new
oct
reuters
a
competition
is
emerging
among
energy
exporters
proposing
crude
terminals
along
the
gulf
coast
to
handle
a
gusher
of
shale
oil
coming
from
west
texas
oilfields
on
monday
private
equity
firm
carlyle
group
became
the
latest
to
place
a
bet
proposing
with
the
port
of
corpus
christi
what
it
said
would
be
the
first
onshore
export
facility
able
to
load
the
world
s
largest
crude
tankers
the
winners
of
the
export
terminal
race
likely
will
be
those
best
able
to
navigate
a
regulatory
process
that
includes
multiple
government
approvals
and
overcome
labor
and
supply
shortages
that
have
already
frustrating
some
early
projects
to
expand
export
infrastructure
the
contest
comes
as
the
shale
revolution
is
expected
to
send
the
nation
s
oil
production
to
million
barrels
per
day
by
the
end
of
from
million
bpd
in
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
existing
coastal
terminals
could
be
overwhelmed
by
late
next
year
as
a
flurry
of
new
pipelines
come
into
operation
and
move
million
barrels
of
oil
landlocked
in
west
texas
to
the
gulf
coast
say
oil
companies
and
analysts
carlyle
s
facility
which
aims
to
begin
operations
by
late
will
compete
with
other
texas
and
louisiana
projects
proposed
by
trafigura
ag
and
pipeline
operators
enterprise
products
partners
lp
and
tallgrass
energy
lp
enterprise
and
trafigura
have
not
provided
timelines
noting
permits
must
be
secured
first
tallgrass
says
it
hopes
to
provide
an
offshore
crude
loading
terminal
off
the
lousiana
coast
by
the
third
quarter
of
roughly
a
year
behind
carlyle
s
estimate
each
aims
to
fully
load
very
large
crude
carriers
vlccs
tankers
able
to
carry
up
to
million
barrels
of
oil
to
markets
in
asia
latin
america
and
europe
most
would
require
running
pipelines
away
from
ports
and
into
the
deeper
parts
of
the
ocean
to
allow
loading
of
the
larger
ships
all
of
these
proposals
face
significant
licensing
and
other
hurdles
like
others
the
of
corpus
christi
project
must
pass
lengthy
state
and
federal
approvals
it
also
must
await
completion
of
an
army
corps
of
engineers
project
that
has
been
delayed
about
a
year
said
sean
strawbridge
chief
executive
officer
of
the
port
of
corpus
christi
authority
one
of
the
challenges
is
there
more
dredging
demand
than
there
is
capacity
in
the
united
states
right
now
he
said
for
the
project
to
hit
its
target
date
it
would
have
to
secure
permits
by
next
spring
and
find
dredging
contractors
to
work
immediately
after
finishing
the
army
corps
project
he
said
although
shale
production
is
expected
to
rise
substantially
it
will
not
fill
all
the
proposed
projects
said
john
coleman
an
oil
market
analyst
at
research
firm
wood
mackenzie
everyone
is
racing
to
throw
their
hat
in
the
ring
and
get
their
project
done
before
everyone
else
he
said
only
one
or
two
of
the
five
proposed
offshore
ports
likely
will
be
needed
there
s
simply
not
enough
oil
volumes
to
go
total
crude
exports
hit
a
record
million
bpd
in
june
and
analysts
say
the
ceiling
is
around
million
bpd
which
is
less
than
the
capacity
of
the
export
terminals
beings
considered
you
can
t
build
all
these
terminals
so
there
is
an
advantage
to
being
among
the
first
sarah
emerson
managing
principal
at

esai
energy
llc
said
on
monday
today
more
than
percent
of
crude
exports
move
through
corpus
christi
s
port
its
exports
this
year
rose
about
bpd
in
the
first
nine
months
from
bpd
in
oil
producer
conocophillips
which
has
exported
about
million
barrels
of
crude
from
its
south
texas
operations
from
corpus
christi
this
year
expects
port
facilities
to
be
strained
when
coming
pipelines
open
there
is
probably
going
to
be
some
tightness
particularly
at
corpus
probably
in
late
when
these
pipes
start
up
said
don
wallette
conoco
s
finance
chief
however
port
expansion
from
houston
to
corpus
christi
will
resolve
the
problem
he
said
the
danger
for
oil
producers
is
the
pipeline
congestion
that
has
landlocked
crude
in
west
texas
becomes
a
gulf
coast
port
congestion
by
the
refining
industry
can
not
consume
all
of
the
projected
oil
production
the
nation
began
an
building
spree
after
former
president
barack
obama
in
lifted
a
ban
on
crude
exports
but
as
corpus
christi
s
experience
shows
that
building
boom
has
driven
up
prices
for
needed
dredging
its
initial
project
to
deepen
a
shipping
channel
to
enough
to
accommodate
tankers
carrying
million
barrels
of
oil
is
being
renegotiated
after
bids
were
more
than
percent
of
the
budget
for
the
work
with
carlyle
it
aims
to
take
a
portion
of
the
channel
to
deep
these
projects
aren
t
going
to
get
any
cheaper
and
the
longer
they
take
the
more
expensive
they
re
going
to
be
