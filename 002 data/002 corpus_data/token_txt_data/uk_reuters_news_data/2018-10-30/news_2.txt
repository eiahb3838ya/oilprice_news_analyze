will
fall

a

earlier

brent
reached
a
session
low
of
a
barrel
the
lowest
since
wti
slumped
to
a
barrel
the
weakest
since
prices
were
little
changed
in

after
industry
group
the
american
petroleum
institute
reported
crude
inventories
rose
million
barrels
last
week
more
than
analysts
forecast
for
a
build
investors
will
look
to
official

due
to
be
released
wednesday
both
crude
benchmarks
have
fallen
about
a
barrel
from
highs
reached
in
the
first
week
of
october
and
were
on
track
to
post
their
worst
monthly
performance
since
july
oil
has
been
caught
in
the
global
financial
market
slump
this
month
with
equities
under
pressure
from
the
trade
fight
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
the
united
states
has
imposed
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
and
china
has
responded
with
retaliatory
duties
on
billion
worth
of
goods
president
donald
trump
said
on
monday
he
thinks
there
will
be
a
great
deal
with
china
on
trade
but
warned
that
he
has
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
new
tariffs
ready
to
go
if
a
deal
is
not
possible
trump
said
he
would
like
to
make
a
deal
now
but
that
china
was
not
ready
he
did
not
elaborate
one
discussion
that
is
developing
is
that
trade
tensions
are
hurting
demand
for
crude
oil
there
s
probably
an
element
of
truth
to
that
said
bob
yawger
director
of
futures
at
mizuho
in
new
york
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
high
oil
prices
were
hurting
consumers
and
could
dent
fuel
demand
at
a
time
of
slowing
global
economic
activity
oil
production
from
russia
the
united
states
and
saudi
arabia
reached
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
for
the
first
time
in
september
refinitiv
eikon
data
showed
graphic
russian
and
saudi
crude
oil
output
that
is
an
increase
of
million
bpd
since
the
start
of
the
decade
and
means
the
three
producers
alone
now
meet
a
third
of
global
crude
demand
the
united
states
is
set
to
impose
new
sanctions
on
iranian
crude
from
next
week
and
exports
from
the
islamic
republic
have
already
begun
to
fall
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
said
they
will
pump
enough
to
meet
demand
once
sanctions
are
imposed
the
fact
that
this
price
weakness
is
developing
just
ahead
of
the
official
kickoff
of
the
iranian
oil
sanctions
suggests
an
amply
supplied
market
in
which
additional
supply
was
brought
to
market
well
in
advance
of
a
likely
acceleration
in
iranian
export
decline
