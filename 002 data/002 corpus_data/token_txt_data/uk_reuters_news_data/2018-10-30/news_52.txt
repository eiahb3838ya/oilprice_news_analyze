poking

the
bright
pink
bougainvillea
that
spills
into
the
street
the
lone
minaret
of
the
ta
la
mosque
towers
over
the
khalda
neighbourhood
of
amman
aside
from
its
colourful
windows
and
ornate
calligraphy
this
mosque
stands
out
for
another
reason
its
roof
is
covered
with
shining
solar
panels
that
make
the
building
s
carbon
emissions
close
to
zero
the
structure
is
part
of
a
wider
effort
by
mosques
and
many
other
buildings
in
the
city
to
capitalise
on
jordan
s
plentiful
sunshine
and
shift
towards
renewable
energy
in
a
bid
to
achieve
amman
s
goal
of
becoming
a
carbon
neutral
city
by
almost
all
the
mosques
here
in
jordan
now
cover
percent
of
their
energy
needs
with
renewable
power
said
yazan
ismail
an
energy
auditor
at
energy
and
environmental
solutions
a
green
consultancy
in
jordan
amman
is
one
of
more
than
cities
worldwide
that
are
aiming
to
become
carbon
neutral
by
meaning
they
will
produce
no
more
emissions
than
they
can
offset
such
as
by
planting
trees
each
is
going
about
achieving
the
goal
in
its
own
way
but
because
cities
account
for
about
of
carbon
dioxide
emissions
according
to
the
united
nations
and
consume
more
than
of
the
world
s
energy
whether
they
succeed
or
fail
will
have
a
huge
impact
on
if
the
world
s
climate
goals
are
met
in
amman
the
push
to
make
mosques
greener
which
began
in
with
backing
from
the
ministry
of
religious
affairs
has
been
so
successful
that
many
are
now
selling
excess
energy
back
to
the
national
grid
ismail
said
for
the
ta
la
mosque
s
imam
who
speaks
to
the
faithful
in
his
friday
sermons
about
protecting
the
climate
the
decision
to
adopt
clean
energy
coincides
with
wider
religious
values
the
main
reason
for
the
use
of
solar
energy
is
religious
duty
said
ahmad
al
rawashdeh
islam
urges
conservation
of
nature
s
resources
he
said
and
warns
against
extravagance
but
the
use
of
solar
energy
and
led
lightbulbs
also
is
helping
the
mosque
financially
he
admitted
amman
where
temperatures
already
soar
above
degrees
celsius
fahrenheit
in
the
summer
has
clear
incentives
to
try
to
hold
the
line
on
global
warming
but
renewables
are
far
from
the
norm
in
most
of
the
country
jordan
still
imports
close
to
percent
of
its
energy
most
of
it
polluting
fossil
fuels
from
its
middle
eastern
neighbours
according
to
the
world
bank
government
officials
say
they
are
going
to
change
that
we
are
committed
to
reducing
our
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
percent
by
minister
of
environment
nayef
hmeidi
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
country
aims
to
generate
percent
of
its
energy
from
renewable
sources
by
said
it
s
a
target
he
thinks
will
be
met
early
in
part
as
solar
panels
go
up
on
the
city
s
homes
businesses
and
government
buildings
earlier
this
year
the
abu
dhabi
future
energy
company
masdar
put
in
place
million
in
financing
to
develop
jordan
s
largest
solar
power
plant
for
the
state
national
electric
power
company
the
project
is
scheduled
to
go
online
in
the
first
half
of
and
will
supply
power
to
about
homes
while
displacing
tonnes
of
carbon
dioxide
annually
a
statement
from
masdar
said
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
the
international
academy
one
of
the
first
schools
to
go
solar
in
amman
in
now
gets
almost
percent
of
its
energy
from
renewable
sources
said
khaled
al
salaymah
assistant
general
manager
of
the
school
at
al
hoffaz
children
in
orange
and
black
uniforms
chant
their
as
they
file
down
the
stairs
of
the
academy
one
of
about
schools
in
amman
seeking
to
lower
carbon
emissions
based
on
our
community
and
public
responsibilities
we
want
to
reduce
our
emissions
and
carbon
contribution
urgently
said
al
salaymah
also
there
s
an
economic
dimension
we
ve
reduced
our
energy
consumption
costs
too
he
said
along
with
glimmering
solar
electrical
panels
covering
the
basketball
court
the
teachers
car
park
and
much
of
the
roof
the
school
uses
solar
water
heaters
and
recycles
its
waste
while
also
prioritising
environmental
education
he
said
we
hold
awareness
sessions
for
students
parents
and
teachers
here
to
ensure
they
know
the
benefits
of
going
green
and
using
renewable
energy
al
salaymah
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
it
s
not
just
installing
solar
panels
we
want
to
be
green
in
every
he
said
he
had
noticed
a
rise
in
social
awareness
of
the
risks
of
climate
change
particularly
among
young
jordanians
the
mentality
has
changed
he
said
jordan
is
also
trying
to
cut
emissions
from
tourism
the
country
hopes
to
market
itself
as
a
haven
for
ecotourists
keen
to
stay
in
resorts
along
the
salty
dead
sea
or
near
the
unesco
world
heritage
site
of
petra
the
feynan
ecolodge
sits
on
the
edge
of
the
dana
biosphere
reserve
on
the
road
to
the
ancient
crimson
carved
city
of
petra
with
solar
appliances
serving
its
rooms
and
corridors
the
lodge
is
entirely
off
grid
and
offers
visitors
the
chance
to
feast
on
vegetarian
food
stargaze
or
learn
to
bake
bread
beneath
the
hot
sand
manager
nabil
tarazi
said
the
lodge
s
daily
energy
consumption
was
less
than
that
of
a
apartment
in
amman
the
lodge
is
part
of
a
string
of
buildings
backed
by
jordan
s
royal
society
for
the
conservation
of
nature
rscn
including
a
similar
resort
north
of
amman
in
the
protected
forest
reserve
of
ajloun
nestled
among
evergreen
oaks
that
lodge
harvests
rainwater
and
uses
geothermal
heating
and
cooling
to
keep
its
emissions
at
net
zero
despite
jordan
s
efforts
to
cut
carbon
emissions
amman
faces
big
challenges
including
a
booming
population
swollen
by
the
arrival
of
more
than
half
a
million
refugees
fleeing
conflict
in
neighbouring
syria
arid
amman
is
also
among
the
most
cities
in
the
world
enough
that
jordan
is
now
looking
into
desalination
plants
to
keep
the
taps
running
but
the
push
for
solar
power
may
also
help
a
may
report
by
the
world
resources
institute
found
that
thirsty
middle
eastern
and
north
african
countries
including
jordan
could
cut
water
demand
by
switching
to
solar
power
which
uses
less
water
to
produce
than
fossil
fuel
electricity
generation
jordan
s
environment
minister
said
he
has
confidence
amman
and
the
country
will
continue
pushing
to
meet
their
ambitious
goals
we
always
optimistic
in
jordan
that
the
way
that
we
survive
