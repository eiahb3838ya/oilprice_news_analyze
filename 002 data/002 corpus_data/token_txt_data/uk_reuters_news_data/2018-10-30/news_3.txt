santiago
oct
reuters
argentina
has
begun
exporting
natural
gas
to
chile
after
a
year
interlude
chilean
president
sebastian
pinera
said
on
tuesday
as
the
two
south
american
neighbors
seek
to
increasingly
integrate
their
energy
supply
and
electricity
grids
the
unconventional
gas
is
being
piped
from
argentina
s
and
vaca
muerta
shale
field
in
the
neuquen
basin
then
sent
over
the
andes
mountain
range
to
chile
s
southern
province
of
biobio
we
are
working
enthusiastically
with
argentine
president
mauricio
macri
to
integrate
our
energy
supply
pinera
said
in
a
speech
the
exports
mark
a
turning
point
in
energy
trade
in
the
region
argentina
which
sits
atop
the
world
s
no
shale
gas
reserves
was
once
a
major
supplier
of
natural
gas
to
chile
but
triggered
a
diplomatic
crisis
in
the
by
cutting
off
shipments
when
its
own
supplies
ran
low
the
move
sent
chile
a
global
mining
powerhouse
that
has
few
hydrocarbons
of
its
own
scrambling
to
find
new
sources
of
supply
the
spat
also
helped
foster
a
move
towards
alternative
energy
sources
like
wind
and
solar
in
chile
pinera
said
the
two
countries
had
very
different
but
often
complementary
energy
needs
and
that
depending
on
the
time
of
year
and
circumstance
could
either
export
or
import
fuel
and
electricity
across
their
shared
border
this
will
permit
us
to
back
one
another
up
without
having
to
spend
excess
money
to
do
so
