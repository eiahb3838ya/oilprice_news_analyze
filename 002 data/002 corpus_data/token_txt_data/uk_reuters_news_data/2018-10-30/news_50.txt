south
korea
has
asked
the
united
states
for
maximum
flexibility
on
its
request
for
a
waiver
to
prevent
south
korean
companies
from
being
affected
by
renewed
sanctions
against
iran
the
foreign
ministry
said
the
sanctions
against
iranian
crude
oil
exports
are
set
to
take
effect
on
as
part
of
president
donald
trump
s
efforts
to
force
tehran
to
accede
to
a
more
restrictive
deal
on
curbing
its
nuclear
and
missile
programmes
south
korea
a
ally
and
one
of
asia
s
biggest
buyers
of
iranian
oil
has
already
stopped
crude
imports
from
iran
south
korean
building
firms
have
also
cancelled
contracts
in
iran
due
to
financing
difficulties
foreign
minister
kang
asked
for
the
exemption
in
a
telephone
call
with
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
late
on
monday
the
ministry
said
in
a
statement
minister
kang
requested
the
side
exert
maximum
flexibility
so
that
south
korea
can
secure
an
exemption
to
minimise
the
damage
to
our
companies
the
ministry
said
pompeo
said
he
noted
seoul
s
position
and
would
continue
discussions
on
the
matter
the
ministry
said
the
exemption
issue
is
the
latest
sign
of
strain
between
seoul
and
washington
over
a
range
of
issues
especially
the
enforcement
of
sanctions
aimed
at
limiting
north
korea
s
nuclear
and
missile
programmes
south
korea
and
japan
have
been
in
talks
with
the
united
states
in
a
bid
to
avoid
adverse
impacts
from
the
reimposition
of
sanctions
on
iran
both
countries
won
waivers
during
the
previous
round
of
sanctions
that
ended
in
but
washington
has
adopted
a
more
aggressive
stance
this
time
south
korean
buyers
of
iranian
oil
have
cut
their
purchases
in
recent
months
due
to
expensive
middle
east
grades
and
uncertainty
over
trade
with
iran
imports
of
iranian
oil
fell
to
zero
in
september
for
the
first
time
since
another
risk
for
south
korean
companies
is
that
sanctions
will
make
it
difficult
to
receive
and
make
payments
in
dollars
for
projects
linked
to
iran
on
monday
hyundai
engineering
construction
said
it
scrapped
a
billion
won
million
pounds
deal
to
build
a
petrochemicals
complex
in
iran
due
to
lack
of
financing
in
june
daelim
industrial
said
a
trillion
won
contract
to
build
a
refinery
project
in
iran
was
cancelled
due
to
financing
