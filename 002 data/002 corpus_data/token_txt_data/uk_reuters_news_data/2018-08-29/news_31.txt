the

one
of

s
biggest
fuel
importers
also
aims

reduce

a
member
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
with
output
reaching
more

in
since
then
the
international
oil
majors
that
had
dominated
the
country
s
oil
development
have
scaled
back
their
operations
because
of
uncertainty
around
regulations
the
lack
of
investment
in
new
reserves
and
rising
fuel
demand
has
caused
indonesia
to
become
a
net
oil
importer
pertamina
is
due
in
take
over
as
operator
of
the
rokan
block
indonesia

falling
tanri
abeng
pertamina
s
president
commissioner
told
reporters
that

appointed
because
there
was
a
need
for
someone
with
experience
from
a
multinational
blocks
that
have
been
given
to
pertamina
are
not
easy
very
difficult
tasks
but
also
an
opportunity
for
us
we
will
be
able
to
increase
our
production
which
is
only
about
a
third
of
the
domestic
output
said
abeng
pertamina
said
this
week
it
aims
to
lift
overall
oil
output
to
bpd
in
up
from
s
goal
of
bpd
abeng
urged
the
government
not
to
keep
shaking
up
management
at
pertamina
which
faces
frequent
interference
from
the
government
due
to
its
importance
on
the
economy
particularly
at
a
time
when
the
rupiah
currency
is
under
pressure
