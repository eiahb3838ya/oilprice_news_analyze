after
years
of
restraint
since
crude
prices
slumped
in
oil
services
companies
are
now
at
loggerheads
with
producers
as
they
battle
for
what
they
see
as
a
fair
share
of
the
sector
recovery
oil
industry
suppliers
say
they
have
cut
costs
and
prices
to
the
bone
and
the
recent
rebound
in
crude
justifies
better
rewards
for
anything
from
rigs
to
logistics
and
engineering
services
their
overtures
have
met
with
stubborn
resistance
from
producers
but
there
are
increasing
signs
that
something
has
to
give
including
recent
strikes
at
north
sea
platforms
the
cost
savings
that
we
have
achieved
over
the
past
three
years
are
not
sustainable
said
thierry
pilenko
executive
chairman
of
technipfmc
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
oil
services
groups
a
rig
that
was
once
at
day
is
now
at
which
is
not
even
cash
breakeven
he
added
referring
to
rig
rental
rates
cost
inflation
will
come
back
the
drilling
industry
working
below
breakeven
is
not
the
oil
market
is
cyclical
by
nature
if
crude
prices
fall
so
does
investment
and
then
output
which
in
turn
drives
up
prices
and
oil
services
companies
ride
the
rollercoaster
by
using
the
upturns
to
raise
their
prices
to
offset
the
downturns
global
exploration
and
production
spending
shot
up
by
a
quarter
in
fell
percent
in
jumped
by
about
percent
two
years
later
and
then
tanked
by
more
than
a
fifth

according
to
data
from

consequently
average

rates
that
were
about
for
a
floating

in
more
than
doubled
by
and
then
fell
to
about
last
year
rystad
said
it
is
still
a
feast
or
famine
cycle
the
ceo
of
oilfield
services
group
baker
hughes
lorenzo
simonelli
told
an
industry
conference
in
the
norwegian
oil
capital
of
stavanger
after
benchmark
oil
futures
contracts
slumped
from
more
than
a
barrel
in
to
less
than
in
early
oil
producers
cut
spending
drastically
and
promised
shareholders
that
cost
discipline
was
here
to
stay
graphic
boom
and
bust
cycles
of
oil
services
sector
signs
of
rising
rates
have
begun
to
emerge
in
the
united
states
but
oil
producers
are
loath
to
put
the
genie
back
in
the
bottle
there
might
be
pressure
on
costs
but
we
will
never
forget
what
we
have
learned
equinor
chief
executive
eldar
saetre
told
the
stavanger
conference
indeed
equinor
s
announcement
on
tuesday
that
it
plans
to
drill
production
and
exploration
wells
off
norway
during
the
next
two
decades
came
with
a
caveat
there
is
no
room
for
cost
inflation
in
those
plans
said
arne
sigve
nylund
head
of
equinor
s
norwegian
operations
we
need
to
deliver
at
the
same
level
we
are
now
i
call
on
suppliers
to
work
with
us
on
how
to
deliver
at
the
lowest
possible
but
with
oil
now
trading
around
a
barrel
strikes
at
several
of
total
s
north
sea
offshore
platforms
are
testimony
to
an
industry
wrestling
with
keeping
efficiencies
high
and
costs
down
the
way
contracts
are
structured
between
producers
and
services
will
be
key
to
the
future
level
of
costs
there
is
a
big
dichotomy
now
some
of
the
contractors
are
expecting
to
see
price
increases
they
are
almost
saying
it
s
my
turn
now
luis
araujo
ceo
of
oil
services
company
aker
solutions
said
i
don
t
buy
into
that
i
think
we
should
work
araujo
pointed
to
clients
such
as
aker
bp
offering
contracts
more
akin
to
incentive
schemes
than
ways
to
squeeze
margins
in
the
future
maybe
suppliers
are
going
to
get
paid
by
performance
so
instead
of
getting
paid
by
the
daily
rates
you
will
be
paid
by
how
many
meters
you
can
equinor
s
saetre
put
it
even
more
succinctly
at
the
stavenger
conference
with
the
words
of
rock
star
bruce
springsteen
emblazoned
on
the
big
screen
nobody
wins
unless
everybody
but
given
oil
producers
own
constraints
the
message
might
not
have
trickled
through
quite
yet
we
have
to
be
a
bit
cautious
because
the
guys
doing
the
presentations
are
the
leaders
but
then
there
is
the
next
layer
in
line
who
are
being
educated
to
squeeze
suppliers
and
not
collaborate
