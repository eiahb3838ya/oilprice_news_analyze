norway
s
equinor
is
focusing
its
green
efforts
on
offshore
wind
a
goal
it
is
already
on
its
way
to
achieve
but
some
investors
are
concerned
about
the
impact
this
shift
will
have
on
the
company
s
bottom
line
european
oil
and
gas
companies
are
diversifying
their
portfolio
to
include
sources
of
energy
as
a
result
of
the
paris
agreement
which
outlines
a
shift
from
fossil
fuels
this
century
equinor
formerly
statoil
is
betting
on
offshore
wind
leveraging
its
expertise
in
operating
offshore
platforms
and
its
ability
to
scale
up
small
projects
into
industrial
ones
last
year
equinor
opened
the
first
floating
offshore
wind
farm
off
scotland
and
on
tuesday
it
said
it
was
planning
to
use
floating
wind
turbines
to
power
offshore
oil
installations
in
a
world
first
i
think
the
floating
concept
is
very
fascinating
we
have
a
leading
position
there
right
now
equinor
ceo
eldar
saetre
told
reuters
equinor
also
plans
to
build
three
large
wind
projects
off
the
coasts
of
the
united
states
poland
and
britain
the
three
projects
alone
could
cost
around
billion
to
build
at
current
prices
which
already
fulfils
the
announced
budget
of
billion
crowns
or
billion
according
to
a
reuters
estimate
by
comparison
repsol
has
gone
into
operating
hydropower
plants
total
is
developing
solar
power
and
owns
a
battery
producer
while
bp
bought
britain
s
largest
electric
vehicle
charging
company
for
equinor
it
s
more
important
to
diversify
because
it
depends
more
on
upstream
compared
to
its
peers
like
shell
total
or
bp
which
have
larger
downstream
operations
which
will
be
less
impacted
by
the
energy
transition
rohan
murphy
an
analyst
at
allianz
global
investors
told
reuters
equinor
has
said
it
aims
to
dedicate
up
to
percent
of
its
capital
expenditure
by
to
renewables
saetre
said
the
plan
could
amount
to
billion
norwegian
crowns
for
the
period
roughly
billion
it
could
be
more
than
billion
crowns
but
it
could
be
also
less
it
s
not
a
fixed
number
saetre
said
annual
spending
is
likely
to
increase
as
approaches
and
more
projects
reach
maturity
he
added
a
spokeswoman
said
the
company
expected
costs
associated
with
offshore
wind
to
fall
in
the
future
allowing
more
to
be
built
with
the
same
money
equinor
has
said
it
planned
to
spend
between
million
and
million
on
new
energy
solutions
in
and
million
to
billion
in
equinor
has
also
bought
danske
commodities
an
electricity
and
gas
trader
but
sees
offshore
wind
as
its
main
growth
area
executives
told
reuters
on
tuesday
they
planned
to
make
the
final
investment
decision
on
britain
s
dogger
bank
project
in
the
north
sea
by
may
and
intended
to
take
part
in
an
auction
to
supply
offshore
wind
power
to
the
state
of
new
york
later
this
year
it
is
also
opening
an
office
in
japan
to
position
for
potential
offshore
wind
tenders
there
it
aims
to
reduce
the
production
cost
of
floating
wind
power
to
euros
per
megawatt
hour
mwh
by
making
it
competitive
with
other
sources
of
energy
from
around
euros
per
mwh
at
its
scottish
project
by
scaling
up
and
simplifying
the
technology
equinor
s
green
shift
came
soon
after
saetre
took
the
helm
of
statoil
in
following
the
departure
of
helge
lund
to
lead
bg
one
of
saetre
s
first
decisions
was
to
establish
a
separate
business
segment
to
drive
investments
in
renewable
and
technologies
two
years
later
he
pushed
for
statoil
to
be
renamed
equinor
to
reflect
its
commitment
toward
becoming
a
broad
energy
company
some
in
norway
protested
shocked
that
a
national
champion
established
for
years
would
drop
its
name
the
energy
transition
in
the
oil
industry
is
probably
the
hottest
topic
now
woodmackenzie
research
director
valentina
kretzschmar
told
reuters
but
some
investors
are
concerned
particularly
those
on
the
who
demand
maximum
returns
on
a
quarterly
basis
she
said
the
jury
is
still
out
whether
it
is
the
right
thing
for
oil
majors
to
invest
in
renewables
at
all
she
said
there
is
no
question
that
renewables
and
electric
cars
fleet
will
continue
to
grow
whether
oil
and
gas
companies
are
right
to
invest
is
an
open
there
is
also
caution
among
investors
keener
for
oil
companies
to
grapple
with
the
energy
transition
we
don
t
want
them
to
go
and
just
greenwash
things
they
have
to
make
things
work
and
show
that
they
are
worthy
of
the
capital
said
murphy
at
allianz
global
investors
saetre
is
convinced
this
is
the
way
forward
some
people
say
we
should
stick
to
producing
oil
and
gas
but
i
have
realized
that
at
some
point
the
energy
transition
will
have
an
impact
on
that
you
can
get
to
a
point
where
oil
and
gas
starts
to
shrink
