nigeria
is
on
the
verge
of
a
boom
in
mini
power
grids
that
could
stimulate
rural
economies
and
bring
jobs
to
frustrated
youth
thinking
of
leaving
researchers
said
on
wednesday
less
than
half
of
all
nigerians
and
only
about
a
third
of
those
living
in
rural
areas
have
access
to
electricity
according
to
the
united
states
agency
for
international
development
minigrids
power
systems
that
often
use
solar
power
and
can
generate
electricity
for
to
people
are
starting
to
take
off
in
nigeria
and
could
change
that
the
rocky
mountain
institute
said
in
a
report
this
week
these
minigrids
could
drive
a
significant
economic
change
in
rural
nigeria
said
sachi
graber
an
associate
with
the
and
of
the
report
more
than
percent
of
nigerian
business
owners
cite
electrification
problems
as
their
main
challenge
said
the
study
produced
with
the
nigerian
economic
summit
group
a
think
tank
minigrids
give
rural
businesses
a
cheaper
more
reliable
alternative
to
the
diesel
generators
people
use
now
to
power
everything
from
sawmills
to
barbershops
said
james
sherwood
of
the
report
change
is
already
evident
in
parts
of
nigeria
where
they
have
been
installed
he
said
as
soon
as
the
minigrid
shows
up
you
see
people
moving
in
from
other
areas
and
the
economy
grows
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
poverty
has
driven
thousands
of
nigerians
to
try
to
migrate
to
europe
in
recent
years
and
many
have
died
on
the
journey
through
the
sahara
desert
and
across
the
mediterranean
the
fact
that
electricity
access
is
a
big
driver
of
migration
within
countries
means
it
could
influence
international
migration
too
said
leo
roberts
a
specialist
in
renewable
energy
at
the
overseas
development
institute
people
tend
to
move
from
places
with
lower
levels
of
access
to
electricity
which
tend
to
be
rural
areas
to
urban
areas
where
there
is
a
higher
level
of
access
he
said
so
one
of
the
things
you
see
with
minigrids
is
that
people
are
more
likely
to
stay
where
they
after
tanzania
nigeria
is
the
african
country
that
is
farthest
along
in
developing
minigrids
because
the
government
has
taken
an
active
interest
roberts
said
but
challenges
remain
primarily
the
lack
of
financing
and
nervousness
of
investors
to
put
money
in
new
markets
