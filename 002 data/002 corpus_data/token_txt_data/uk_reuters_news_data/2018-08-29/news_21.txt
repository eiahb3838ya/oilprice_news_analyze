oil
producer
magnolia
oil
gas
corp
aims
to
at
least
triple
in
market
valuation
in
coming
years
as
it
develops
shale
acreage
across
eastern
and
southern
texas
chief
executive
steve
chazen
said
on
wednesday
magnolia
s
shares
have
rallied
about
percent
this
year
alongside
a
rise
in
crude
prices
and
as
the
company
has
focused
on
shareholder
returns
amidst
rising
pressure
from
wall
street
on
the
sector
the
company
formed
earlier
this
year
by
private
equity
firm
tpg
capital
and
chazen
the
former
occidental
petroleum
ceo
has
been
amassing
acreage
across
the
eagle
ford
shale
formation
and
the
austin
chalk
limestone
and
clay
formation
the
oil
industry
is
about
money
not
about
romance
chazen
said
in
an
interview
our
model
is
to
live
within
cash
magnolia
s
market
valuation
of
billion
likely
could
grow
to
between
billion
to
billion
in
coming
years
chazen
said
adding
that
such
a
level
would
be
a
manageable
size
to
oversee
as
ceo
chazen
declined
to
comment
on
when
that
level
could
be
reached
but
the
company
expects
to
double
in
size
without
acquisitions
within
five
years
our
end
game
is
to
build
our
company
to
a
rational
size
and
if
we
continue
to
grow
and
generate
excess
cash
flow
to
return
cash
to
shareholders
he
said
magnolia
which
pumps
more
than
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
invests
less
than
percent
of
its
cash
flow
into
drilling
and
other
operations
saving
the
rest
for
growth
opportunities
and
other
uses
the
austin
chalk
which
lies
atop
the
eagle
ford
in
parts
of
texas
is
undergoing
a
renaissance
of
sorts
as
oil
producers
magnolia
included
deploy
technology
developed
in
the
shale
boom
magnolia
which
operates
more
than
acres
added
to
its
holdings
in
the
area
earlier
this
month
in
a
million
purchase
of
acreage
from
privately
held
harvest
oil
gas
production
from
the
austin
chalk
jumped
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
last
year
from
bpd
five
years
ago
according
to
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
which
expects
the
production
gains
to
continue
unlike
some
rivals
magnolia
has
not
invested
in
the
permian
basin
of
west
texas
and
new
mexico
the
largest
oilfield
chazen
s
former
company
occidental
is
the
permian
s
largest
oil
producer
but
that
company
bought
much
of
its
acreage
years
ago
before
land
prices
spiked
new
entrants
in
the
permian
have
a
position
because
they
have
to
pay
a
lot
to
get
there
chazen
said
the
eagle
ford
and
austin
chalk
are
less
popular
but
the
acreage
costs
are
more
