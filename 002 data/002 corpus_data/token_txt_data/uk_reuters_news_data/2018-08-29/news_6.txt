norway cold-proofs troubled kollsnes gas plant to protect uk flows
oslo

norway
s
largest
gas
processing
plant
kollsnes
a
key
facility
for
british
exports
which
faced
outages
last
winter
is
having
additional
upgrades
this
summer
to
protect
it
against
extreme
weather
later
in
the
year
operator
gassco
told
reuters
in
late
february
when
a
cold
snap
dubbed
the
beast
from
the
east
hit
europe
sending
energy
prices
to
highs
kollsnes
had
to
drastically
reduce
output
as
equipment
parts
froze
stripping
britain
of
gas
supplies
on
march
the
second
day
of
the
plant
s
outage
the
lack
of
supplies
in
britain
coinciding
with
high
demand
caused
prompt
gas
prices
in
the
country
to
quadruple
with
the
price
reaching
pence
per
therm
the
highest
since
the
liberalisation
of
the
market
in
the
the
winterization
programme
for
kollsnes
has
also
been
updated
extensive
heating
measures
to
ensure
the
best
possible
production
availability
also
during
winter
and
extreme
weather
conditions
is
an
example
said
gassco
s
spokeswoman
lisbet
kallevik
gassco
is
also
working
on
reinforcing
the
power
grid
as
a
part
of
this
project
added
kallevik
the
kollsnes
plant
is
at
the
middle
of
its
planned
maintenance
period
at
the
moment
and
works
are
scheduled
to
continue
until
even
though
maintenance
at
norway
s
gas
processing
plants
happens
virtually
every
year
this
summer
s
works
are
much
more
extensive
and
targeted
a
lot
of
the
equipment
that
was
more
exposed
to
the
elements
is
being
insulated
to
withstand
cold
the
extraordinary
weather
conditions
that
kollsnes
faced
in
february
a
combination
of
very
low
temperatures
that
reached
as
low
as
minus
degrees
celsius
and
strong
wind
created
a
challenge
engineers
call
a
cold
bridge
in
the
event
of
a
cold
bridge
impulse
lines
which
are
small
pipes
used
to
connect
larger
gas
pipes
with
measuring
instruments
freeze
as
a
result
typical
process
systems
like
pressure
transmitters
and
pressure
controllers
connected
to
impulse
lines
used
to
trace
heat
are
disrupted
gassco
is
now
insulating
the
instrumented
systems
and
will
boost
heat
tracing
of
the
equipment
exposed
to
the
weather
elements
to
reduce
vulnerability
and
the
technical
risk
exposure
on
the
plant
our
target
is
to
secure
full
production
availability
at
the
plant
at
all
times
but
still
it
s
impossible
to
promise
that
we
will
not
see
any
outages
this
winter
kallevik
said
gassco
declined
to
disclose
the
cost
of
the
additional
maintenance
at
kollsnes
equinor
kollsnes
technical
service
provider
is
also
evaluating
its
short
and
routines
for
extremely
cold
weather
to
reduce
the
probability
and
consequences
of
equipment
failure
