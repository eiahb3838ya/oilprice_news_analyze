crept

on

was
quickly
clouded
by
caution
ahead
of
a
looming
deadline
on

with
china
a

japan

fared

stubborn

at

analysts
at
jpmorgan
noted
the
deadline
for
public
comment
on
president
donald
trump
s
increased
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
was
less
than
a

could
start
to
take

into
the
end
of

and
combined
with

flow
and

escalation

canada
s
main
trade
negotiator
was
in
talks
to
preserve
a
north
american
free
trade
agreement
following
monday
s
deal
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
president
trump
warned
that
he
could
proceed
with
mexico
alone
and
levy
tariffs
on
canada
if
it
does
not
come
on
board
with
the
revised
trade
terms
yet
even
if
trump
were
to
go
with
mexico
alone
congress
would
have
to
approve
the
deal
in
a
process
that
would
take
months
and
put
it
beyond
the
elections
in
a
nutshell
it
seems
that
many
contentious
issues
remain
unresolved
and
there
is
a
very
tight
timeline
that
needs
to
be
followed
if
a
nafta
deal
is
to
be
ratified
by
the
current
congress

said
in

the
