nigeria
s
presidency
rebuffed
a
landmark
oil
industry
reform
law
because
of
issues
with
its
current
form
the
executive
said
on
wednesday
marking
a
setback
for
plans
to
reinvigorate
investment
in
africa
s
largest
crude
producing
nation
the
presidency
said
it
had
sent
the
petroleum
industry
governance
bill
pigb
dealing
in
part
with
the
management
of
the
nigerian
national
petroleum
corporation
back
to
the
national
assembly
last
month
this
legislation
forms
a
section
of
the
broader
petroleum
industry
bill
pib
part
of
the
presidency
s
disagreement
with
lawmakers
is
the
fact
that
the
bill
would
reduce
the
power
of
the
president
and
oil
minister
to
oversee
and
award
oil
licences
and
contracts
said
a
person
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
president
muhammadu
buhari
is
also
the
nigerian
oil
minister
the
pigb
was
returned
to
parliament
at
the
end
of
july
partly
because
it
allowed
a
regulatory
body
to
take
percent
of
oil
revenues
to
the
detriment
of
federal
state
and
local
governments
said
ita
enang
a
presidency
official
who
liaises
with
the
legislature
provisions
such
as
the
expanded
remit
of
an
oil
fund
and
others
that
created
conflicts
in
interpretation
or
ambiguity
were
also
partly
the
reason
why
the
bill
was
not
fit
for
presidential
assent
enang
said
in
a
statement
the
head
of
the
upper
house
of
parliament
s
committee
on
upstream
petroleum
was
not
immediately
available
for
comment
the
governance
bill
would
create
four
new
entities
whose
powers
would
include
the
ability
to
conduct
bid
rounds
award
exploration
licences
and
make
recommendations
to
the
oil
minister
on
upstream
licences
both
houses
of
parliament
passed
the
governance
bill
in
january
but
it
still
needed
the
president
s
signature
to
become
law
senate
president
bukola
saraki
told
reuters
in
may
that
it
had
been
transferred
to
the
presidency
but
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
said
it
was
not
sent
until
july
when
parliament
had
intended
to
have
all
the
pib
sections
passed
parliament
has
so
far
passed
only
the
governance
section
of
the
bill
after
it
was
broken
down
into
sections
to
try
to
accelerate
its
passage
when
buhari
came
to
power
in
passage
of
the
pib
was
seen
as
critical
for
the
revival
of
investments
into
the
sector
according
to
a
presidential
report
from
the
time
seen
by
reuters
the
administration
s
plan
had
been
to
pass
the
pib
within
days
of
taking
power
according
to
the
report
which
noted
that
uncertainties
over
the
fiscal
terms
from
an
unapproved
pib
were
a
key
issue
in
nigeria
s
oil
sector
