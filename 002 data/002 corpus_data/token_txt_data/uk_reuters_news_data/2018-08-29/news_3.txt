sarajevo
reuters
bosnia
s
central
government
adopted
a
energy
strategy
on
wednesday
after
years
of
political
wrangling
between
its
two
regions
paving
the
way
for
major
funding
from
the
european
union
and
other
investors
with
this
act
we
completed
the
adoption
of
a
package
of
four
most
important
strategies
for
economic
reforms
said
bosnia
s
prime
minister
denis
zvizdic
we
stopped
a
negative
trend
that
meant
we
could
not
apply
for
energy
projects
and
lost
hundreds
of
millions
of
euros
of
investments
and
grants
zvizdic
told
a
news
conference
bosnia
which
aspires
to
join
the
eu
has
long
struggled
to
adopt
strategies
for
transportation
agriculture
the
environment
and
energy
which
are
requirements
of
receiving
funding
for
these
sectors
from
the
wealthy
bloc
the
country
s
two
autonomous
regions
the
serb
republic
and
the
federation
dominated
by
muslim
bosniaks
and
croats
failed
to
harmonise
their
regional
sectoral
strategies
with
the
one
proposed
by
the
central
government
this
document
opens
the
prospect
of
development
of
the
energy
sector
competition
and
unlocks
the
eu
funds
and
grants
from
the
western
balkans
investment
fund
said
foreign
trade
minister
mirko
sarovic
he
said
the
framework
strategy
for
drafted
under
eu
sponsorship
and
designed
to
secure
electricity
supply
and
a
transition
to
green
energy
anticipated
an
investment
of
about
billion
bosnian
marka
billion
pounds
but
bosnia
still
needs
to
change
its
regulations
to
meet
terms
set
by
the
european
energy
community
sarovic
added
unlike
its
balkan
neighbours
which
rely
on
imports
to
meet
much
of
their
energy
demand
bosnia
is
able
to
export
power
thanks
partly
to
its
hydro
power
capacity
which
provides
percent
of
its
electricity
the
rest
of
its
power
comes
from
plants
separately
the
serb
republic
and
serbia
agreed
on
wednesday
to
jointly
build
two
hydro
power
plants
with
a
total
capacity
of
megawatts
on
the
drina
river
that
runs
along
the
border
between
bosnia
and
serbia
to
help
diversify
their
energy
mix
the
prime
minister
of
the
serb
republic
zeljka
cvijanovic
said
after
a
joint
session
of
the
two
governments
in
the
southeastern
bosnian
town
of
trebinje
that
the
hydro
power
plants
foca
and
paunci
were
expected
to
cost
about
million
pounds
