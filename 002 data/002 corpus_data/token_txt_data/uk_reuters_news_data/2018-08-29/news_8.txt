update 1-clashes shatter illusion of security in libyan capital
reuters
a
bout
of
fighting
in
libya
s
capital
has
laid
bare
the
fragility
of
a
militia
cartel
that
had
brought
a
veneer
of
stability
to
the
city
and
encouraged
the
gradual
return
of
foreign
diplomats
and
plans
for
elections
in
december
major
battles
have
become
rarer
in
tripoli
since
last
year
as
a
handful
of
armed
factions
aligned
with
the
internationally
recognised
government
of
national
accord
gna
consolidated
their
control
but
the
ascent
of
four
or
five
super
militias
has
created
resentment
among
groups
excluded
from
the
capital
and
from
access
to
the
spoils
of
libya
s
informal
economy
that
has
heightened
the
risk
of
conflict
and
made
the
challenge
of
disbanding
militias
or
integrating
them
into
regular
security
forces
more
complex
diplomats
and
analysts
say
bringing
militias
to
heel
is
seen
as
crucial
to
resolving
a
conflict
that
has
divided
libya
since
a
uprising
forced
muammar
gaddafi
from
power
seven
years
ago
slashing
oil
production
and
giving
space
to
migrant
smugglers
and
militants
fighting
on
monday
and
tuesday
pitted
the
seventh
brigade
or
kaniyat
from
tarhouna
a
town
km
miles
southeast
of
tripoli
against
the
tripoli
revolutionaries
brigades
trb
and
the
nawasi
two
of
the
capital
s
largest
armed
groups
the
kaniyat
and
other
groups
from
outside
tripoli
have
noticed
the
success
of
rivals
inside
the
city
with
growing
unease
reports
about
the
wealth
power
and
extravagant
lifestyles
of
some
tripoli
militia
commanders
have
fuelled
resentment
the
profits
from
state
capture
now
go
to
a
narrower
set
of
armed
groups
than
ever
before
said
wolfram
lacher
a
researcher
at
the
german
swp
that
s
a
very
dangerous
situation
because
it
excludes
powerful
forces
from
access
to
levers
of
the
state
and
administration
and
this
is
now
causing
those
forces
to
build
alliances
against
the
big
militias
in
as
they
launched
their
incursion
into
tripoli
kaniyat
denounced
their
rivals
as
the
daesh
islamic
state
of
public
money
promising
to
cleanse
them
from
the
country
kaniyat
made
gains
as
tanks
armoured
vehicles
and
pickup
trucks
mounted
with
guns
were
deployed
in
densely
populated
residential
areas
of
southern
tripoli
with
explosions
and
heavy
artillery
fire
echoing
across
the
city
at
least
five
people
were
killed
and
nearly
wounded
on
the
first
day
officials
said
tripoli
s
big
armed
groups
claim
official
status
through
the
gna
which
is
opposed
by
a
rival
government
and
military
faction
based
in
the
east
of
the
sprawling
north
african
country
but
act
with
autonomy
they
guard
strategic
buildings
control
tripoli
s
airport
and
have
infiltrated
ministries
and
many
of
the
banks
giving
them
access
to
coveted
dollars
at
the
official
exchange
rate
about
five
times
cheaper
than
the
parallel
rate
they
place
their
people
throughout
the
state
administration
particularly
in
positions
that
offer
control
of
economic
resources
said
lacher
since
last
summer
an
minister
the
mayor
of
tripoli
and
the
head
of
the
state
religious
authority
have
been
among
a
series
of
senior
figures
to
be
abducted
then
released
by
militias
a
key
member
of
the
gna
s
leadership
fathi
withdrew
from
his
position
after
an
armed
group
attacked
his
residence
in
june
earlier
this
month
the
national
oil
corporation
denounced
militia
threats
against
the
newly
appointed
head
of
its
fuel
distribution
unit
over
efforts
to
tackle
smuggling
and
the
sovereign
wealth
fund
said
that
it
had
been
forced
by
threats
and
abductions
to
move
premises
prominent
libyans
based
abroad
have
said
they
seek
the
protection
of
armed
militia
factions
not
the
government
when
they
travel
to
tripoli
diplomatic
staff
evacuated
amid
fighting
in
and
now
tentatively
returning
ultimately
depend
on
armed
groups
for
access
and
protection
critics
of
a
plan
to
hold
national
elections
on
worry
that
a
free
vote
will
be
impossible
and
that
militias
will
challenge
with
force
any
result
they
don
t
like
i
think
it
s
a
race
against
time
and
i
feel
like
the
libyan
state
s
disappearing
said
one
senior
diplomat
it
s
hard
now
to
tell
where
s
the
state
and
where
s
the
gaddafi
s
dictatorship
left
libya
with
few
effective
state
institutions
after
his
overthrow
