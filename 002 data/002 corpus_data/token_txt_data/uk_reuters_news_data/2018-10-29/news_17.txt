reliance
industries
currently
india
s
second
most
valuable
listed
company
got
rich
by
trading
fuel
across
asia
africa
and
europe
while
effectively
ignoring
its
home
market
reliance
s
refineries
processed
crude
from
the
nearby
middle
east
and
sold
fuel
to
markets
in
north
asia
including
china
japan
south
korea
and
taiwan
that
began
to
change
when
india
s
oil
demand
surged
overtaking
japan
as
the
world
s
consumer
reliance
took
more
interest
in
the
country
s
retail
fuel
sector
and
has
opened
more
than
service
stations
this
push
into
the
domestic
fuel
market
may
stumble
after
india
s
government
imposed
cost
controls
on
on
gasoline
and
diesel
prices
to
rein
in
recent
record
highs
reliance
s
shares
plunged
percent
on
the
day
of
the
announcement
and
are
down
about
percent
since
their
record
close
on
the
decline
has
pushed
reliance
s
market
capitalization
down
to
trillion
rupees
billion
and
it
is
no
longer
india
s
most
valuable
company
sitting
behind
tata
consultancy
services
ltd
at
trillion
rupees
the
price
shock
driven
by
soaring
crude
import
costs
angered
consumers
and
triggered
riots
by
farmers
forcing
the
government
to
react
at
the
cost
of
its
refiners
health
for
now
reliance
is
staying
with
its
retail
plans
despite
the
recent
trouble
when
prices
are
cut
you
have
to
effectively
match
it
said
venkatachari
srikanth
reliance
s
joint
chief
financial
officer
during
their
earnings
presentation
on
we
are
not
going
to
let
this
alter
broadly
our
strategy
on
retail
in
line
with
that
reliance
is
planning
as
many
as
retail
stations
with
oil
major
bp
plc
over
the
next
three
years
local
media
reported
on
tuesday
reliance
s
domestic
push
made
sense
in
an
asian
fuel
market
that
is
increasingly
crowded
with
new
refinery
capacity
from
the
middle
east
southeast
asia
and
china
the
new
capacity
combined
with
soaring
crude
prices
has
eroded
profit
margins
for
producing
refined
fuels
with
the
domestic
market
now
also
under
pressure
from
price
controls
some
analysts
have
been
spooked
sukrit
vijayakar
director
of
indian
oil
consultancy
trifecta
said
the
government
move
could
be
disastrous
for
the
retail
move
puts
reliance
into
competition
against
government
controlled
refiners
like
bharat
petroleum
corp
hindustan
petroleum
corp
and
indian
oil
corp
the
country
s
biggest
refiner
reliance
s
domestic
strategy
initially
won
the
backing
of
investors
and
the
retail
fuels
group
was
touted
by
company
chairman
mukesh
ambani
in
a
speech
at
its
annual
general
meeting
in
july
between
january
and
august
reliance
shares
soared
percent
far
outpacing
the
refiners
as
well
as
india
main
stock
index
the
nifty
which
gained
percent
but
rising
crude
prices
which
jumped
from
under
per
barrel
in
early
to
around
in
early
october
and
a
tumbling
rupee
combined
to
push
domestic
fuel
prices
to
records
undermining
reliance
s
retail
strategy
despite
some
relief
from
a
dip
in
crude
prices
in
recent
weeks
still
rohit
ahuja
senior
vice
president
of
india
s
bob
capital
markets
which
has
a
buy
rating
on
reliance
said
signs
of
an
oil
price
shock
in
india
were
already
reliance
may
gradually
mothball
its
retail
stations
because
of
the
cost
controls
said
macquarie
capital
ltd
analyst
aditya
suresh
in
a
note
on
though
the
bank
expects
no
meaningful
impact
on
its
earnings
reliance
may
be
better
placed
to
thrive
on
exports
despite
the
increasing
competition
in
asia
and
the
middle
east
the
company
operates
the
world
s
biggest
refinery
complex
at
the
port
of
jamnagar
in
the
western
indian
state
of
gujarat
the
first
jamnagar
plant
can
process
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
while
the
second
site
can
process
another
bpd
reliance
s
refining
margins
last
quarter
were
at
a
premium
of
per
barrel
over
the
average
singapore
margin
the
benchmark
for
asia
however
the
singapore
margin
has
dropped
by
about
percent
since
because
of
rising
crude
prices
reliance
also
said
in
its
results
that
fewer
refinery
outages
last
quarter
meant
global
run
rates
were
high
still
reliance
s
refineries
benefit
from
being
among
the
most
modern
in
the
world
several
units
process
residual
fuel
oil
the
leftovers
after
crude
oil
is
initially
refined
into
gasoline
and
distillate
products
as
well
as
remove
pollutants
such
as
sulfur
that
ability
to
cut
its
fuel
oil
output
to
nearly
nothing
while
maximizing
its
diesel
fuel
output
gives
reliance
an
advantage
as
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
will
require
new
fuel
oil
used
in
ships
starting
in
imo
regulations
are
positive
because
of
our
configuration
said
reliance
s
srikanth
with
a
move
toward
cleaner
fuels
as
part
of
imo
bob
capital
s
ahuja
said
reliance
s
gross
refining
margins
could
rise
by
up
to
per
barrel
beyond
imo
and
the
indian
fuel
price
turmoil
the
oil
industry
is
threatened
by
the
rise
of
electric
vehicles
and
alternative
fuels
that
could
reduce
oil
s
use
as
a
transport
fuel
refiners
are
looking
at
petrochemicals
to
replace
potentially
lost
demand
in
the
transport
sector
if
i
have
to
look
at
it
from
a
oil
demand
hit
from
electric
vehicles
perspective
it
s
going
to
be
petrochemicals
that
s
going
to
survive
for
them
reliance
beyond
ten
years
said
ahuja
combined
reliance
s
refining
and
marketing
group
along
with
its
petrochemicals
division
contribute
more
than
percent
of
the
overall
company
revenues
its
latest
annual
report
showed
under
reliance
s
oil
to
chemicals
journey
strategy
the
company
is
seeking
to
upgrade
all
of
our
fuels
to
high
value
petrochemicals
over
the
next
decade
we
are
focusing
to
produce
and
sell
at
every
level
said
reliance
s
srikanth
between
whether
to
sell
domestically
or
on
bulk
whether
we
will
export
every
day

analysis
of
which
is
