said
on
monday
it
is
delaying
a
final
decision
on
whether
to
build
its
magnolia
liquefied
natural

plant
citing
problems
lining
up
chinese
customers
due
to
the

war
the

now
targeting
final

for
magnolia
located
in

chief

greg
vesey
said
in
a
tweet
noting
multiple
opportunities
with
customers
in
europe
and
asia
exist
and
our
discussions
with
them
are
proceeding
development
of
liquefied
natural
gas
terminals
to
ship
the
fuel
around
the
world
has
soared
due
to
rising
demand
particularly
out
of
asia
as
countries
seek
more
energy
sources
as
a
substitute
for
dirtier
coal
president
donald
trump
has
promoted
the
growth
of
lng
exports
around
the
world
as
part
of
his
efforts
for
global
energy
dominance
but
the
escalating
trade
dispute
with
china
has
harmed
those
plans
lng
ltd
had
planned
to
make
a
final
investment
decision
by
the
end
of
about
magnolia
which
is
designed
to
produce
million
tonnes
of
lng
per
year
we
made
that
statement
prior
to
the
trade
tensions
that
have
manifested
over
the
past
months
which
have
caused
headwinds
for
lng
transactions
vesey
said
in
a
quarterly
report
china
purchased
about
bcf
of
lng
from
the
united
states
in
or
about
percent
of
all
lng
shipped
that
year
but
is
on
track
to
fall
short
of
that
level
in
according
to
thomson
reuters
vessel
tracking
and
department
of
energy
data
lng
ltd
s
delay
underscored
how
china
the
world
s
lng
market
has
shifted
its
lng
procurement
strategies
away
from
the
united
states
in
the
last
few
months
due
in
part
to
the
trade
dispute
that
has
had
repercussions
for
the
scale
and
pace
for
the
next
wave
of
projects
said
saul
kavonic
oil
and
gas
researcher
for
credit
suisse
in
sydney
regardless
of
how
long
the
trade
dispute
lasts
the
overall
risk
profile
of
lng
will
remain
heightened
in
chinese
lng
buyers
eyes
for
some
time
to
come
kavonic
said
lng
ltd
shares
hit
a
low
on
the
day
before
closing
down
percent
at
australian
cents
the
company
is
developing
two
plants
magnolia
where
it
planned
to
begin
exports
in
and
bear
head
in
nova
scotia
in
canada
vesey
told
reuters
in
may
that
the
plans
have
strictly
been
about
marketing
to
but
that
was
before
beijing
imposed
a
percent
tariff
on
lng
as
the
trade
war
escalated
washington
has
imposed
tariffs
across
the
spectrum
on
imported
chinese
goods
there
are
varying
views
on
how
and
when
the
trade
issues
with
china
will
be
resolved
vesey
said
on
monday
considering
that
our
communications
with
potential
chinese
offtakers
remain
robust
with
the
intent
to
complete
agreements
if
trade
tensions
abate
before
magnolia
is
fully
sold
out
he
said
the
united
states
is
on
track
to
export
over
trillion
cubic
feet
of
gas
as
lng
in
making
the
country
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
exporters
of
the
fuel
in
the
united
states
exported
billion
cubic
feet
worth
about
billion
one
billion
cubic
feet
is
enough
to
fuel
about
million
homes
for
a
day
like
so
many
lng
projects
around
the
world

joseph

there
are
two
lng
export
terminals
operating
in
the
united
states
with
four
more
plants
expected
to
enter
service
next
year
over
two
dozen
lng
export
projects
are
also
in
development
and
at
least
ten
companies
have
said
they
plan
to
make
final
decisions
to
build
in
the
next
two
years
lng
demand
is
indeed
growing
strongly
however
the
universe
of
proposed
projects
is
many
times
the
size
of
potential
demand
growth
so
a
majority
of
the
proposed
but
currently
unsanctioned
projects
will
fail
to
reach
final
investment
decision
