demand
for
bitcoin
could
derail
efforts
to
limit
global
warming
because
the
increasingly
popular
digital
currency
takes
huge
amounts
of
energy
to
produce
scientists
said
on
monday
producing
bitcoin
at
a
pace
with
growing
demand
could
by
defeat
the
aim
of
limiting
global
warming
to
degrees
celsius
according
to
research
published
in
the
journal
nature
climate
change
almost
nations
agreed
in
paris
in
on
the
goal
to
keep
warming
to
well
below
a
rise
of
above
times
but
mining
the
process
of
producing
bitcoins
by
solving
mathematical
equations
uses
computers
and
alto
of
electricity
the
researchers
said
currently
the
emissions
from
transportation
housing
and
food
are
considered
the
main
contributors
to
ongoing
climate
change
said
study
katie
taladay
in
a
statement
this
research
illustrates
that
bitcoin
should
be
added
to
this
mining
is
a
lucrative
business
with
one
bitcoin
currently
selling
for
about
british
pounds
in
bitcoin
production
and
usage
emitted
an
estimated
million
metric
tons
of
carbon
dioxide
equivalent
the
researchers
said
that
year
bitcoin
was
involved
in
less
than
half
of
percent
of
the
world
s
cashless
transactions
they
said
as
the
currency
becomes
more
common
researchers
said
it
could
use
enough
electricity
to
emit
about
gigatonnes
of
carbon
within
a
decade
and
a
half
one
gigatonne
is
equal
to
one
billion
metric
tons
of
carbon
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
that
thing
is
using
alot
of
electricity
that
means
bad
business
for
the
environment

bitcoin
mining
however
is
becoming

she
said
bitcoin
miners
are
moving
away
from
sites
such
as
china
with

to
more
environmentally
friendly
