oct

brazilian
sugar
and
ethanol
producers
said
on
monday
that
the
outlook
for
the
sector
is
gradually
improving
and
that
better
prospects
for
next
year
s
season
could
include
shifting
more
production
back
to
the
sweetener
millers
taking
part
in
datagro
s
international
sugar
conference
in
são
paulo
said
that
a
recent
price
rally
in
new
york
could
help
forward
sales
of
sugar
which
in
turn
might
lead
mills
to
earmark
more
cane
to
sugar
production
than
they
did
this
year
and
less
to
ethanol
they
also
think
that
a
new
government
in
brazil
that
is
pledging
to
adopt
policies
would
eventually
lead
to
higher
fuel
consumption
sustaining
ethanol
demand
and
forcing
sugar
consumers
worldwide
to
pay
more
for
the
sweetener
to
compete
i
think
mills
have
to
take
the
opportunity
to
hedge
some
sugar
now
and
avoid
betting
too
much
on
ethanol
next
year
which
is
always
subject
to
oil
prices
and
public
policies
gabriel
feres
junqueira
chief
executive
officer
of
bioenergética
aroeira
mill
told
reuters
considering
currency
exchange
rates
and
new
york
futures
currently
they
could
fix
a
price
of
reais
per
tonne
of
sugar
for
next
season
which
is
a
reasonable
value
he
said
his
company
decided
not
to
produce
any
sugar
this
year
allocating
percent
of
the
cane
to
ethanol
production
junqueira
said
bioenergética
aroeira
was
one
of
the
mills
in
brazil
s
that
concentrated
entirely
on
the
biofuel
on
average
the
region
is
earmarking
around
percent
of
cane
to
ethanol
production
and
only
percent
to
sugar
in
the
current
season
the
worst
is
in
the
past
the
outlook
is
constructive
said
mariangela
grola
market
intelligence
manager
at
raízen
the
world
s
largest
sugar
producer
she
expects
sugar
prices
could
go
up
to
cents
per
pound
if
global
supplies
shrink
due
to
production
difficulties
in
some
producing
countries
and
buyers
turn
strongly
again
to
brazil
where
they
will
have
to
compete
with
ethanol
mario
lorencatto
ceo
of
coruripe
one
of
the
ten
largest
sugar
and
ethanol
companies
in
brazil
said
his
company
already
managed
to
secure
profitable
forward
sales
combining
new
york
futures
with
local
currency
forward
ndf
contracts
the
arrangement
has
been
profitable
he
said
it
is
quite
possible
that
more
sugar
production
will
be
considered
in
brazil
next
season
at
this
level
of
prices
