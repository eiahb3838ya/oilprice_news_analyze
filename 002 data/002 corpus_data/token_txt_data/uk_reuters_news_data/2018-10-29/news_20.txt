former

into
italy
via
their

at

that
the
pipeline
would
have
to
go
ahead
he
said
italy
would
face
penalties
of
billion
euros
billion
if
it
pulled
out
at
this
late
stage
facing
ridicule
and
criticism
on
social
media
di
maio
said
the
party
was
under
attack
both
from
inside
and
out
and
urged
supporters
to
close
ranks
in
the
same
way
ancient
roman
soldiers
locked
their
shields
together
to
keep
out
enemy
arrows
today
in
our
army
some
people
are
showing
signs
of
weakness
we
can
not
allow
ourselves
such
weakness
di
maio
wrote
on
the
party
website
the
slightest
failure
on
any
front
means
that
all
the
land
we
have
conquered
will
return
to
being
s
the
formed
a
coalition
with
the
league
in
june
and
is
battling
against
the
restraints
of
government
which
sometimes
clash
with
its
roots
besides
giving
way
on
the
tap
di
maio
has
also
had
to
ignore
party
objections
to
keeping
the
giant
ilva
steelworks
open
he
is
also
having
to
back
a
tax
amnesty
which
was
endorsed
by
the
league
but
is
anathema
to
his
own
supporters
anxiety
di
maio
said
he
found
out
how
much
it
would
cost
to
cancel
tap
only
after
he
had
taken
office
and
gained
access
to
official
documents
ministers
from
the
former
government
denied
his
version
of
events
and
said
all
documentation
was
public
they
are
lying

matteo
renzi
said
promised
to
block
tap
within
two
weeks
of
taking
office
they
won
votes
on
the
back
of
this
promise
after
six
months
they
changed
their
mind
we
lost
the
election
italy
has
lost
time
di
maio
has
lost
face
renzi
said
in
a
statement
with
tap
and
ilva
moving
ahead
attention
is
switching
to
another
major
project
that
has
always
opposed
and
that
is
under
consideration
a
rail
link
known
as
tav
that
is
meant
to
connect

in

saying
he
wanted
a
analysis
of
the
line
the
turin
newspaper
la
stampa
quoted
di
maio
on
monday
as
warning
the
league
that
his
party
would
implode
if
tav
went
ahead
however
the
league
supports
the
link
which
involves
building
a
tunnel
under
the
alps
arguing
that
it
will
strengthen
trade
in
the

a
largely
symbolic

calling
for
work
on
the

to
be
suspended
the
league
distanced
itself
from
the
motion
praising
the
tav
as
a
strategic
project
we
don
t
want
to
run
the
risk
of
seeing
our

shut
off
from
european
trade
routes
now
that
we
really
