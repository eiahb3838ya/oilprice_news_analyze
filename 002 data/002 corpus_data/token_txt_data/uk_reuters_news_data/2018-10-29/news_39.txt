iberdrola
s
scottish
power
will
use
offshore
wind
power
to
replace
the
capacity
of
the
gas
and
hydro
power
projects
it
is
selling
with
wind
becoming
its
sole
source
of
electricity
production
iberdrola
s
director
of
offshore
told
reuters
scottish
power
the
british
arm
of
the
spanish
energy
giant
earlier
this
month
announced
plans
to
sell
a
group
of
gas
hydro
and
pumped
storage
power
plants
for
million
pounds
million
to
british
power
generator
drax
the
sale
makes
scottish
power
the
first
of
britain
s
big
six
energy
suppliers
to
shift
to
percent
renewable
electricity
generation
but
it
will
more
than
halve
its
uk
capacity
scottish
power
already
owns
around
megawatts
mw
of
operational
on
and
offshore
wind
projects
in
the
uk
and
plans
to
more
than
double
this
with
new
east
anglia
wind
projects
off
the
east
coast
of
england
set
to
replace
the
lost
generation
jonathan
cole
told
reuters
in
an
interview
if
you
look
at
the
capacity
of
east
anglia
one
and
three
with
the
two
projects
alone
we
will
cover
the
generation
being
sold
to
drax
he
said
the
billion
pound
east
anglia
one
project
will
at
megawatts
mw
of
capacity
produce
enough
electricity
to
power
around
homes
in
the
company
is
also
developing
the
east
anglia
three
windfarm
which
at
mw
could
power
around
homes
scottish
power
has
almost
million
electricity
customers
and
million
gas
customers
in
the
uk
it
does
not
yet
have
the
capacity
to
provide
all
these
customers
with
renewable
power
but
this
will
change
as
new
projects
are
built
cole
said
it
s
entirely
feasible
that
at
some
point
in
the
future
we
will
produce
enough
power
on
our
own
to
supply
all
our
customers
with
renewable
energy
he
said
at
the
east
anglia
one
site
iberdrola
has
installed
of
jacket
foundations
which
will
provide
the
base
to
house
the
near
meter
high
turbine
towers
for
the
project
east
anglia
one
has
already
secured
a
subsidy
from
britain
s
government
through
its
contracts
for
difference
renewable
auction
and
cole
said
the
company
will
enter
east
anglia
three
into
next
year
s
auction
it
s
fully
consented
with
everything
ready
to
bid
into
the
next
auction
process
in
the
uk
next
year
he
said
under
the
government
s
renewable
subsidy
auctions
project
developers
are
awarded
a
minimum
price
for
the
electricity
they
will
produce
the
cost
of
producing
electricity
from
offshore
windfarms
has
plummeted
in
the
past
few
years
helped
by
larger
turbines
britain
s
last
renewable
auction
held
in
cleared
at
a
record
low
of
pounds
per
megawatt
hour
for
offshore
wind
figures
cole
said
the
company
is
comfortable
with
anyone
who
s
in
the
uk
market
has
to
look
at
what
happened
last
time
and
be
pitching
around
that
level
he
said
scottish
power
could
also
develop
two
more
east
anglia
sites
with
a
combined
capacity
of
mw
he
added
pounds
