trumpâ€™s iran sanctions resolve faces test from oil-thirsty china, india
oct
reuters
shortly
after
president
donald
trump
announced
in
may
he
would
reimpose
sanctions
on
iran
the
state
department
began
telling
countries
around
the
world
the
clock
was
ticking
for
them
to
cut
oil
purchases
from
the
islamic
republic
to
zero
the
strategy
is
meant
to
cripple
iran
s
economy
and
force
tehran
to
quash
not
only
its
nuclear
ambitions
but
this
time
its
ballistic
missile
program
and
its
influence
in
syria
with
just
days
to
go
before
renewed
sanctions
take
effect
the
reality
is
setting
in
three
of
iran
s
top
five
customers
india
china
and
turkey
are
resisting
washington
s
call
to
end
purchases
outright
arguing
there
are
not
sufficient
supplies
worldwide
to
replace
them
according
to
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
that
pressure
along
with
worries
of
a
damaging
oil
price
spike
is
putting
the
trump
administration
s
hard
line
to
the
test
and
raising
the
possibility
of
bilateral
deals
to
allow
some
buying
to
continue
according
to
the
sources
the
tension
has
split
the
administration
into
two
camps
one
led
by
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
who
wants
the
toughest
possible
approach
and
another
by
state
department
officials
keen
to
balance
sanctions
against
preventing
an
oil
price
spike
that
could
damage
the
and
its
allies
according
to
a
source
briefed
by
administration
officials
on
the
matter
the
global
price
of
oil
peaked
just
below
a
barrel
this
month
a
high
because
of
that
concern
the
source
said
the
administration
is
considering
limited
waivers
for
some
iranian
customers
until
russia
and
saudi
arabia
add
additional
supply
next
year
while
limiting
what
tehran
can
do
with
the
proceeds
in
the
meantime
revenues
from
sales
could
be
escrowed
for
use
by
tehran
exclusively
for
humanitarian
purposes
the
source
who
asked
not
to
be
named
said
a
mechanism
more
stringent
than
a
similar
one
imposed
on
iran
oil
purchases
during
the
last
round
of
sanctions
under
president
barack
obama
if
you
re
the
administration
you
d
like
to
ensure
you
don
t
have
a
spike
in
the
price
so
you
are
better
off
from
onwards
to
aggressively
enforce
the
barrels
side
of
reducing
to
zero
and
in
the
interim
aggressively
enforcing
the
revenue
side
the
source
said
such
concessions
could
be
problematic
for
the
white
house
as
it
seeks
stricter
terms
than
under
obama
who
along
with
european
allies
imposed
sanctions
that
led
to
an
agreement
limiting
iran
s
nuclear
weapons
development
the
state
department
declined
comment
for
this
story
but
the
administration
has
confirmed
washington
is
considering
waivers
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
told
reuters
that
countries
will
first
have
to
reduce
purchases
of
iran
s
oil
by
more
than
the
percent
level
they
did
under
the
previous
sanctions
treasury
and
state
department
teams
have
traveled
to
more
than
two
dozen
countries
since
trump
pulled
out
of
the
nuclear
deal
on
may
warning
companies
and
countries
of
the
dangers
of
doing
business
with
iran
allies
japan
and
south
korea
have
already
ceased
importing
iran
s
crude
but
the
situation
is
less
clear
among
other
bigger
buyers
brian
hook
the
state
department
s
special
representative
for
iran
and
frank
fannon
state
s
top
energy
diplomat
most
recently
met
with
officials
in
india
iran
s
no
buyer
in
after
a
source
said
for
the
first
time
that
the
administration
was
actively
considering
waivers
an
indian
government
source
said
india
told
the
delegation
that
rising
energy
costs
caused
by
a
weak
rupee
and
high
oil
prices
meant
zeroing
out
iranian
purchases
was
impossible
until
at
least
march
we
have
told
this
to
the
united
states
as
well
as
during
brian
hook
s
visit
the
source
said
we
can
not
end
oil
imports
from
iran
at
a
time
when
alternatives
are
a
diplomat
confirmed
the
discussions
saying
limited
waivers
for
india
and
other
countries
was
possible
india
typically
imports
over
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
iranian
oil
but
has
reduced
that
level
in
recent
months
according
to
official
data
discussions
are
also
underway
with
turkey
iran
s
fourth
biggest
crude
buyer
even
though
turkish
president
tayyip
erdogan
and
turkish
ministers
have
openly
criticized
the
sanctions
an
industry
source
in
turkey
familiar
with
the
talks
told
reuters
the
country
had
cut
iranian
imports
in
half
already
and
could
get
to
zero
but
would
prefer
to
continue
some
purchases
obama
s
administration
granted
a
waiver
to
turkey
but
the
source
said
turkey
expected
the
trump
administration
to
impose
tougher
requirements
for
obtaining
waivers
that
could
potentially
cover
shorter
periods
it
could
be
for
three
months
or
they
may
not
get
a
waiver
at
all
it
is
all
a
bit
unpredictable
this
time
as
we
understand
a
lot
of
things
are
up
to
trump
the
source
said
the
situation
is
least
clear
in
china
iran
s
biggest
customer
whose
buyers
are
also
seeking
waivers
the
country
took
in
between
and
bpd
from
iran
in
the
past
several
months
a
typical
range
beijing
s
signals
to
its
refiners
have
been
mixed
said
the
two
sources
last
week
reuters
reported
sinopec
group
and
china
national
petroleum
corp
cnpc
the
country
s
top
refiners
have
not
placed
orders
for
iranian
oil
for
november
because
of
concerns
about
the
sanctions
joe
mcmonigle
energy
analyst
at
hedgeye
in
washington
said
he
expected
the
administration
would
have
to
accept
some
level
of
iranian
oil
buying
from
china
given
its
consumption
of
all
the
countries
i
don
t
think
they
think
china
is
going
to
zero
he
said
state
department
s
fannon
is
scheduled
to
travel
to
asia
in
coming
days
with
a
speech
in
singapore
planned
for
an
official
did
not
say
if
fannon
would
use
the
trip
to
discuss
iran
with
china
