china

are
coming

this
winter

jinping
earlier
this
year
promised
to
use
the
full
might
of
the
communist
party
to
tackle
the
country
s
longstanding
environmental
problems
but
the
government
is
also
trying
to
ensure
the
war
on
pollution
does
not
disrupt
an
already
slowing
economy
after
shutting
down
huge
swathes
of
industry
last
winter
to
meet
politically
crucial
smog
targets
it
has
promised
to
take
a
more
flexible
approach
this
year
giving
local
governments
the
power
to
set
their
own
goals
but
while
china
is
ahead
of
schedule
when
it
comes
to
curbing
pollution
the
environment
now
faced
an
increasing
number
of
challenges
as
a
result
of
slowing
growth
structural
economic
adjustments
widening
regional
disparities
and
unfavorable

conditions

minister
li
told
officials
china
s
economy
experienced
its
slowest
quarter
since
from
july
to
september
this
year
with
gross
domestic
product
rising
percent
compared
to
a
year
earlier
industrial
profits
also
slowed
for
the
fifth
consecutive
month
in
september
but
though
china
is
taking
action
to
try
to
stimulate
growth
several
key
regions
are
still
about
to
embark
on
a
winter
campaign
against
smog
that
is
expected
to
force
hundreds
of
factories
to
cut
production
the
major
manufacturing
hub
of
jiangsu
in
eastern
china
and
the
top
steel
producing
region
of
hebei
in
the
north
will
both
impose
production
cuts
of
between
percent
this
winter
and
other
cities
in
the
north
are
under
pressure
to
meet
air
quality
targets
the
government
has
already
worked
to
try
to
minimize
the
economic
impact
of
the
crackdowns
on
the
economy
and
has
repeatedly
promised
to
put
an
end
to
the
one
size
fits
all
measures
that
forced
factories
to
shut
down
whether
they
had
implemented
pollution
controls
or
not
at
the
meeting
last
week
li
said
china
would
draw
up
more
detailed
guidelines
to
help
prevent
such
behavior
this
year
and
would
also
establish
dedicated
investigative
teams
to
help
eliminate
the
practice
