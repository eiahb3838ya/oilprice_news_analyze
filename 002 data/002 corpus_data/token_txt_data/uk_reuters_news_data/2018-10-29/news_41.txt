column-trump plays a part as asia's diesel profits surge, gasoline plummets: russell

expressed

diesel
output

it
may
be
stretching
the
bow
too
far
to
blame
donald
trump
for
the
collapse
in
the
profits
asian
refiners
get
for
making
gasoline
or
indeed
for
the
surge
in
diesel
profits
but
the
policies
of
the
president
are
certainly
playing
a
role
the
profit
margin
on
producing
gasoline
at
a
typical
singapore
refinery
dropped
to
per
barrel
of
brent
crude
on
the
lowest
in
months
according
to
refinitiv
data
at
the
same
time
the
profit
or
crack
for
making
a
barrel
of
gasoil
with
parts
per
million
of
sulphur
the
base
for
diesel
and
jet
fuel
reached
above
the
price
of
a
barrel
of
dubai
crude
on
the
strongest
since
february
this
means
that
asian
refiners
are
making
large
profits
from
producing
diesel
and
jet
fuel
but
barely
scraping
by
on
gasoline
however
the
strong
profits
for
the
fuels
mean
the
refiners
are
still
incentivised
to
maximise
their
crude
throughput
that
means
they
will
continue
to
produce
large
volumes
of
gasoline
even
though
it
s
hardly
worth
their
while
to
do
so
how
does
trump
fit
into
this
picture
the
main
influences
are
the
unintended
of
his
administration
s
ongoing
trade
war
with
china
and
the
renewed
sanctions
against
iran
s
crude
oil
exports
the
escalating
trade
dispute
with
china
has
led
the
authorities
in
beijing
to
once
again
open
the
infrastructure
spending
taps
in
a
bid
to
stave
off
a
slowdown
in
their
economy
caused
by
the
imposition
of
tariffs
on
imports
from
china
this
has
had
the
impact
of
increasing
domestic
diesel
demand
which
has
led
to
a
reduction
on
chinese
exports
of
the
transport
fuel
china
s
exports
of
diesel
in
september
dropped
to
a
low
of
million
tonnes
or
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
according
to
customs
data
released
on
in
the
first
eight
months
of
the
year
china
s
diesel
exports
had
averaged
bpd
and
in
may
they
reached
bpd
the
highest
month
so
far
in
the
surge
in
china
s
diesel
exports
in
may
also
coincided
with
the
weakest
profit
margins
for
asian
refiners
producing
the
fuel
with
the
crack
dropping
from
to
late
june
when
it
hit
a
low
for
of
a
barrel
on
june
lower
diesel
exports
from
china
are
likely
to
have
helped
push
the
profit
margin
to
its
recent
highs
but
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
asian
refiners
are
finding
it
harder
to
source
barrels
of
heavy
sour
crude
grades
these
typically
yield
more
middle
distillates
such
as
diesel
and
jet
fuel
and
fewer
light
distillates
like
gasoline
and
naphtha
the
trump
administration
s
renewed
sanctions
on
iran
s
crude
exports
come
into
effect
on
but
major
buyers
in
asia
such
as
india
have
already
cut
back
on
purchases
from
the
islamic
republic
while
china
has
yet
to
curtail
its
buying
from
iran
indications
are
that
it
will
do
so
from
next
month
it
s
also
likely
that
much
of
the
iranian
crude
heading
to
china
will
be
placed
in
bonded
storage
tanks
meaning
it
won
t
clear
customs
and
is
therefore
unavailable
to
chinese
refiners
overall
the
impact
has
been
to
reduce
the
amount
of
heavy
crude
available
to
asian
refiners
many
of
which
operate
complex
plants
capable
of
maximising
diesel
and
jet
fuel
output
from
this
type
of
crude
the
reduction
in
cargoes
heading
to
asia
from
venezuela
another
heavy
crude
producer
has
exacerbated
the
situation
some
refiners
have
been
turning
to
lighter
crudes
from
russia
the
united
states
and
west
africa
to
replace
heavy
crudes
which
have
also
become
more
expensive
this
has
increased
the
amount
of
gasoline
available
in
asia
contributing
to
a
reduction
in
the
profit
margin
for
making
the
fuel
predominately
used
by
light
vehicles
the
gasoline
glut
may
become
worse
in
the
coming
weeks
as
china
has
issued
new
fuel
export
quotas
these
will
likely
increase
the
amount
of
fuel
being
exported
there
is
a
further
interesting
dynamic
at
play
at
the
retail
level
in
several
countries
in
the
region
gasoline
prices
haven
t
dropped
much
at
all
for
consumers
in
india
and
china
gasoline
prices
are
higher
than
those
for
diesel
while
in
australia
gasoline
is
only
slightly
cheaper
while
chinese
retail
prices
may
well
be
described
as
managed
according
to
movements
in
the
crude
price
those
in
india
and
australia
are
largely
set
by
market
forces
if
there
is
a
glut
of
gasoline
in
the
region
it
would
be
logical
to
expect
refiners
to
try
and
clear
it
by
lowering
prices
in
order
to
stimulate
demand
but
this
hasn
t
happened
so
far
