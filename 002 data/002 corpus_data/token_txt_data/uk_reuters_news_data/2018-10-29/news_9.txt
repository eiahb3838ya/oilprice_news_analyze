power
demand
from
french
utility
edf
s
retail
subsidiaries
can
not
limit
the
amount
of
cheap
nuclear
electricity
that
is
available
for
its
competitors
to
buy
the
energy
regulator
said
on
monday
under
the
arenh
mechanism
edf
s
many
smaller
competitors
have
the
right
to
buy
up
to
terawatt
hours
twh
of
power
about
a
quarter
of
the
utility
s
annual
nuclear
energy
output
to
compensate
for
edf
s
monopoly
on
nuclear
production
and
boost
competition
in
recent
years
competitors
have
made
limited
use
of
the
arrangement
as
market
prices
were
below
the
arenh
price
which
has
been
fixed
at
euros
per
megawatt
hour
mwh
since
but
with
market
prices
now
around
euros
per
mwh
demand
for
access
to
the
mechanism
is
high
alternative
power
suppliers
have
argued
that
the
available
arenh
volume
has
been
limited
by
the
demand
of
edf
s
unit
sowee
which
like
other
alternative
suppliers
offers
competitive
market
rates
rather
than
the
regulated
power
tariffs
offered
by
edf
market
regulator
cre
said
in
a
statement
that
ahead
of
the
next
arenh
auction
on
and
a
new
government
decree
reviewing
the
mechanism
demand
for
arenh
power
by
edf
s
own
retail
units
can
not
be
allowed
to
curtail
the
volumes
available
for
other
suppliers
cre
added
that
it
also
wanted
to
avoid
such
demand
driving
up
power
prices
for
these
reasons
cre
has
decided
that
in
the
case
that
there
is
more
demand
than
the
arenh
volume
limit
demand
from
companies
controlled
by
edf
will
be
fully
capped
for
that
part
of
the
volume
that
exceeds
the
limit
it
said
in
a
statement
however
it
said
edf
units
could
buy
extra
power
from
their
parent
company
under
the
same
arenh
terms
enjoyed
by
its
competitors
the
french
power
retail
market
was
opened
to
competition
more
than
a
decade
ago
but
despite
losing
about
customers
per
month
to
new
market
entrants
edf
still
has
a
market
share
of
about
percent
of
french
household
accounts
edf
s
two
biggest
competitors
are
utilities
engie
and
direct
energie
but
retailers
such
as
leclerc
and
casino
and
foreign
firms
such
as
italy
s
eni
are
also
winning
market
share
along
with
dozens
of
smaller
electricity
retail
startups
such
as
enercoop
and
ekwateur
