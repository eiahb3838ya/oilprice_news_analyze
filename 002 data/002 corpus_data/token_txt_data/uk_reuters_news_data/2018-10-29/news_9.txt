power
company
bboxx
is
looking
to
enter
two
new
african
markets
in
partnership
with
france
s
edf
group
next
year
as
it
capitalises
on
growing
interest
in
the
sector
from
large
energy
companies
its
chief
executive
said
on
monday
the
two
companies
announced
last
week
that
the
french
power
utility
had
taken
a
percent
stake
in
bboxx
s
operation
in
togo
where
it
won
a
tender
to
bring
electricity
to
households
without
access
to
the
national
grid
we
are
actively
looking
to
enter
two
more
countries
with
edf
under
the
same
sort
of
agreement
during
the
course
of
mansoor
hamayun
told
reuters
in
an
interview
togo
is
the
starting
he
would
not
name
the
countries
both
of
them
new
markets
for
bboxx
but
said
one
was
located
in
west
africa
and
the
other
in
southern
africa
big
european
power
utilities
are
increasingly
exploring
technology
as
a
way
of
expanding
their
renewables
footprint
and
growing
their
customer
bases
beyond
stagnating
home
markets
some
billion
people
around
the
world
have
no
access
to
a
power
grid
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
iea
lighting
and
phone
charging
alone
costs
them
about
billion
a
year
none
of
the
existing
business
models
and
none
of
the
existing
technologies
are
able
to
reach
the
over
billion
people
who
don
t
have
electricity
said
hamayun
that
makes
an
important
priority
of
organisations
like
edf
s
french
rival
engie
oil
major
total
and
power
companies
enel
of
italy
and
germany
s
have
all
invested
in
the
sector
historically
the
problem
to
scale
for
the
entire
sector
has
been
capital
we
have
way
more
customer
availability
than
we
have
capital
to
go
and
fund
them
he
said
founded
in
bboxx
has
sold
of
its
solar
home
systems
which
allow
customers
without
access
to
a
reliable
grid
to
power
lights
and
small
appliances
it
wants
to
provide
electricity
to
million
people
by
the
need
to
provide
consumer
financing
for
relatively
expensive
kits
however
means
expansion
by
companies
offering
similar
solutions
requires
significant
capital
an
influx
of
money
from
corporations
will
likely
make
that
less
of
an
issue
hamayun
said
allowing
companies
to
scale
up
their
operations
in
new
markets
much
more
quickly
after
their
initial
development
in
east
africa
that
corporate
backing
has
already
helped
fuel
a
rapid
push
by
startups
into
west
africa
hamayun
said
bboxx
which
made
an
initial
investment
in
pakistan
last
year
is
already
looking
beyond
the
west
african
boom
i
think
the
next
big
frontier
is
going
to
become
asia
quite
soon
he
said
we
re
talking
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
who
still
don
t
have
