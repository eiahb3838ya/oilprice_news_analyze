russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
on
saturday
there
was
no
reason
for
russia
to
freeze
or
cut
its
oil
production
levels
noting
that
there
were
risks
that
global
oil
markets
could
be
facing
a
deficit
the

of

petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
led
by
saudi
arabia
and
member
russia
agreed
in
june
to
lift
oil
supplies
but
opec
then
signalled
last
week
that
it
may
have
to
reimpose
output
cuts
as
global
inventories
rise
when
the
russians
start
talking
about
keeping
the
production
levels
high
and
even
the
possibility
that
they
need
to
increase
it
because
of
a
possible
tightness
in
supply
that
brought
on
some
selling
pressure

industrial
commodities
such
as
crude
and
copper
have
also
been
rattled
by
hefty
losses
in
global
equities
due
to
concern
over
corporate
earnings
and
fears
over
the
impact
to
economic
growth
from
escalating
trade
tensions
as
well
as
a
stronger
dollar
the
dollar
index
also
rose
supported
by
robust
consumer
spending
data
a
stronger
dollar
makes
commodities
more
expensive
for
holders
of

fund
managers
have
cut
their
bullish
positions
in
crude
futures
and
options
for
four
weeks
in
a
row
to
their
lowest
since
july
as
the
demand
outlook
grows
more
uncertain
the
hedge
funds
really
abandoned
the
long
side
of
the
market
and
there
s
some
going
on
this
perception
that
perhaps
the
economy
is
slowing

three
of

turkey
are
resisting
washington

call
to
end

purchases
outright
arguing
there
are
not
sufficient
supplies
worldwide
to
replace

according
to
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
that
pressure
along
with
worries
of
a
damaging
oil

raising
the
possibility
of
