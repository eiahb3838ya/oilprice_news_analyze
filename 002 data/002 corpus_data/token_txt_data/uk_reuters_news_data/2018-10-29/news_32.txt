update 1-cuadrilla pauses gas fracking again at english site after tremor
london
reuters
british
shale
gas
company
cuadrilla
has
paused
fracking
at
its
preston
new
road
site
in
northwest
england
for
the
second
time
in
two
weeks
after
a
tremor
with
a
magnitude
of
was
detected
on
monday
the
company
said
the
tremor
is
the
third
recorded
at
the
lancashire
site
over
a
magnitude
limit
set
by
the
government
since
the
company
restarted
fracking
for
natural
gas
on
although
cuadrilla
said
one
was
a
so
called
trailing
event
which
didn
t
stop
production
fracking
or
hydraulically
fracturing
involves
extracting
gas
from
rocks
by
breaking
them
up
with
water
and
chemicals
at
high
pressure
it
is
opposed
by
environmentalists
and
green
groups
who
say
extracting
more
fossil
fuel
is
at
odds
with
britain
s
commitment
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
however
britain
s
government
is
keen
to
reduce
the
country
s
reliance
on
imports
of
natural
gas
which
is
used
to
heat
around
percent
of
britain
s
homes
cuadrilla
said
monday
s
magnitude
tremor
was
way
below
anything
that
can
be
felt
at
the
surface
and
a
very
long
way
from
anything
that
would
cause
damage
or
harm
in
line
with
regulations
hydraulic
fracturing
has
paused
for
hours
now
during
which
seismicity
will
continue
to
be
closely
monitored
well
integrity
has
been
checked
and
verified
cuadrilla
said
in
a
statement
the
company
which
is
percent
owned
by
australia
s
aj
lucas
and
percent
owned
by
a
fund
managed
by
riverstone
first
attempted
to
frack
gas
near
the
coastal
town
of
blackpool
in
northwestern
england
in
but
the
practice
led
to
a
magnitude
earth
tremor
it
said
then
that
the
quakes
at
that
site
were
caused
by
an
unusual
combination
of
geological
features
but
they
led
to
an
nationwide
ban
on
fracking
while
further
research
was
carried
out
the
government
has
since
introduced
a
system
that
immediately
suspends
work
if
seismic
activity
of
magnitude
or
above
is
detected
cuadrilla
said
earlier
this
month
it
expects
to
spend
at
least
three
months
fracking
two
wells
to
determine
whether
gas
extraction
would
be
viable
