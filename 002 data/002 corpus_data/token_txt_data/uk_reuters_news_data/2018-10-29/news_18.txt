focus-vattenfall looks to gas and biomass as end of coal power looms
reuters
vattenfall
is
considering
converting
its
german
power
stations
to
use
fuels
including
gas
or
biomass
as
utility
companies
in
the
country
brace
for
a
government
deadline
for
phasing
out
coal
altogether
the
end
of
coal
is
the
latest
major
challenge
power
firms
face
in
germany
whose
energy
transformation
or
energiewende
has
already
included
a
rushed
exit
from
nuclear
power
and
a
costly
expansion
of
solar
and
wind
capacity

german

deal
with

jittery
ahead
of
a
december
announcement
from
a
commission
about
how
coal
plants
will
be
phased
out
of
europe
s
largest
economy
how
long
moorburg
will
run
significantly
depends
on
what
the
coal
commission
decides
vattenfall
board
member
tuomo
hatakka
told
reuters
we
will
also
examine
alternatives
for
how
to
shape
moorburg
s
future
for
example
through
the
use
of
biomass
we
are
at
a
very
early
stage
in
this
german
rivals
enbw
rwe
and
uniper
have
also
started
to
retrofit
coal
plants
for
biomass
or
gas
or
are
considering
such
steps
to
soften
the
hit
to
earnings
a
shutdown
of
the
power
stations
would
entail
an
accelerated
shutdown
of
moorburg
would
be
a
major
blow
to
vattenfall
which
spent
billion
euros
billion
on
the
plant
converting
plants
to
fuels
such
as
gas
or
biomass
would
also
lead
to
marked
drop
in
generating
capacity
hatakka
also
said
vattenfall
was
planning
to
shut
its
reuter
west
and
moabit
stations
no
later
than
and
partially
replace
them
with

shutting
coal
plants
will
be
the
third
major
shift
for
power
companies
in
a
decade
they
scrambled
to
cope
with
a
expansion
of
renewable
energy
and
then
faced
the
sudden
decision
to
stop
nuclear
power
after
japan
s
fukushima
disaster
as
a
result
of
the
policy
changes
german
electricity
consumers
now
stump
up
more
than
billion
euros
a
year
to
subsidise
solar
and
wind
power
while
utilities
had
to
write
off
billions
of
euros
from
their
nuclear
stations
berlin
later
had
to
compensate
them
for
the
forced
closures
i
do
believe
that
wind
turbines
and
solar
modules
will
be
enough
to
generate
power
in
the
future
said
georg
oehm
chair
of
the
administrative
board
of
the
million
euro
mellinckrodt
equity
fund
in
cheap
nuclear
power
accounted
for
just
percent
of
germany
s
power
production
down
from
percent
a
decade
ago
meanwhile
the
share
of
renewables
in
the
energy
mix
more
than
doubled
to
a
third
last
year
germany
aims
to
raise
that
to
percent
by
to
help
cut
carbon
dioxide
emissions
and
achieve
its
climate
commitments
britain
and
spain
in
contrast
have
taken
a
more
measured
and
less
costly
approach
to
expanding
renewable
energy
and
kept
nuclear
plants
on
line
to
provide
cheap
energy
eu
data
shows
the
use
of
coal
to
generate
electricity
in
germany
is
on
the
wane
but
it
is
still
the
most
commonly
used
fuel
in
coal
and
lignite
or
brown
coal
accounted
for
percent
of
power
production
down
from
percent
a
decade
ago
biomass
usually
refers
to
energy
generated
by
burning
wood
pellets
often
made
from
compressed
sawdust
or
other
organic
matter
the
coal
commission
will
likely
recommend
an
for
coal
plants
in
the
several
people
close
to
the
commission
told
reuters
two
said
ronald
pofalla
last
month
recommended
a
complete
phase
out
between
and
the
commission
declined
to
comment
the
oldest
and
most
polluting
plants
are
expected
to
be
shut
down
right
away
though
operators
may
be
allowed
to
compensate
for
a
fall
in
capacity
by
producing
more
power
at
newer
coal
plants
for
a
while
enbw
said
switching
to
gas
and
biomass
could
work
for
its
plants
as
did
rwe
germany
s
leader
with
gw
of
production
capacity
it
said
building
new
plants
on
coal
sites
would
be
an
option
premises
like
that
are
in
demand
rwe
said
adding
that
it
could
also
sell
sites
to
investors
as
it
did
in
britain
last
year
by
selling
its
littlebrook
plant

rwe
reeling
from
a

this
month
that

delayed

mining
in
the
hambach
forest
singled
out
its
former
plants
at
voerde
and
bochum
as
being
potentially
attractive
for
investors
uniper
sees
similar
potential
for
converting
its
mw
scholven
plant
in
the
industrial
heartland
of
north
it
is
spending
at
least
million
euros
to
retrofit
the
plant
with
gas
turbines
by
as
part
of
the
plan
uniper
has
teamed
up
with
german
chemicals
company
evonik
to
build
a
km
mile
gas
pipeline
to
connect
scholven
to
the
network
of
open
grid
europe
the
retrofit
however
will
drastically
cut
scholven
s
capacity
to
about
mw
because
it
is
harder
to
turn
a
profit
from
gas
which
is
imported
mainly
from
russia
and
is
more
expensive
than
coal
it
s
open
how
many
employees
will
still
be
working
here
in
the
future
said
the
plant
s
manager
lars
wiese
adding
that
scholven
s
current
workforce
of
about
could
more
than
halve
to
make
sure
its
scholven
investment
will
pay
off
uniper
has
agreed
a
partnership
extension
with
an
industrial
enterprise
nearby
it
declined
to
name
the
partner
companies
with
operations
close
to
scholven
include
british
oil
company
bp
and
chemicals
firm
saudi
