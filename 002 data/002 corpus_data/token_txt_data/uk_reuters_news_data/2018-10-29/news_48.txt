big

kellogg
pledged
on

to
cut
all
plastic
waste
from
their
operations
in
what
the
united
nations
called
the
most
ambitious
effort
yet
to
fight
plastic
pollution
the
intiative
comes
as
public
pressure
mounts
on
manufacturers
and
retailers
to
pare
back
the
deluge
of
plastic
packaging
that
is
clogging
landfills
and
choking
the
seas
we
know
that
cleaning
up
plastics
from
our
beaches
and
oceans
is
vital
but
this
does
not
stop
the
tide
of
plastic
entering
the
oceans
each
year
we
need
to
move
upstream
to
the
source
of
the
flow

has
estimated
that
if
current
pollution
rates
continue
there
will
be
more
plastic
in
the
sea
than
fish
by
as
million
tonnes
of
bottles
and
waste
swamp
the
oceans
each
year
killing
marine

the
world
s
worst
plastic

according
to
an

these
three
brands
accounted
for
percent
of
all
plastic
pollution
identified
in
cleanups
according
to
the
analysis
we
are
focused
on
improving
the
sustainability
of
all
of
our
packaging
regardless
of
the
type
and
increasing
the
amount
of
recycled
and
renewable
