stocks
and
commodity
markets
regained
some
poise
on
thursday
having
suffered
wild
tailspins
in
the
previous
session
as
the
united
states
ratcheted
up
trade
war
threats
on
china
a
percent
rebound
on
china
s
big
bourses
had
steadied
asian
nerves
wall
street
futures
were
pointing
higher
and
oil
markets
clawed
back
some
of
wednesday
s
percent
slump
that
had
marked
their
worst
day
in
years
industrial
metals
including
copper
and
nickel
pulled
higher
as
did
european
stocks
while
there
was
even
some
relief
for
turkey
s
lira
after
it
had
been
dumped
to
a
record
low
by
talk
of
interest
rate
cuts
from
its
president
tayyip
erdogan
it
mostly
seems
to
be
relief
after
the
day
yesterday
said
rabobank
strategist
bas
van
geffen
the
basis
for
this
is
not
entirely
clear
to
me
though
because
it
doesn
t
seem
like
this
threat
of
tariffs
on
another
billion
of
goods
has
actually
restarted
negotiations
with
china
in
fact
i
would
argue
that
it
has
made
the
risk
of
an
accident
or
an
unwanted
outcome
europe
s
moves
were
less
pronounced
than
asia
s
had
been
perhaps
reflecting
that
caution
the
shanghai
composite
and
indexes
had
both
ended
the
day
up
percent
shares
in
japan
australia
and
hong
kong
closed
and
percent
higher
respectively
the
stoxx
managed
a
more
modest
percent
with
gains
in
the
healthcare
and
consumer
sectors
offset
by
minor
losses
in
the
banking
sector
and
in
energy
firms
after
the
dramatic
drop
in
oil
prices
germany
s
bond
yield
and
the
euro
were
both
broadly
steady
with
traders
digesting
minutes
from
the
most
recent
european
central
bank
meeting
a
separate
reuters
report
showed
its
policymakers
remain
split
on
when
to
raise
interest
rates
next
year
the
dollar
rose
to
a
high
against
the
japanese
yen
of
after
inflation
data
that
bolstered
the
case
for
more
federal
reserve
rate
hikes
this
year
consumer
inflation
figures
are
due
at
gmt
ahead
of
wall
street
trading
but
the
fact
the
fed
and
the
ecb
have
such
different
rates
means
the
gap
between
treasuries
and
equivalent
german
bund
yields
is
the
widest
in
nearly
years
at
percent
if
stocks
drop
sharply
then
the
fed
will
pause
and
moreover
we
think
the
is
towards
the
end
of
its
rate
hike
cycle
said
thu
lan
nguyen
an
fx
analyst
at
commerzbank
in
frankfurt
there
was
also
relief
for
markets
as
president
donald
trump
came
out
of
a
meeting
of
the
nato
military
allience
in
belgium
with
a
positive
assessment
after
a
string
of
earlier
barbs
we
had
a
fantastic
meeting
at
the
end
trump
told
reporters
very
unified
very
strong
no
focus
was
still
on
what
the
next
steps
in
the
trade
conflict
might
be
china
has
accused
the
united
states
of
bullying
and
warned
it
could
hit
back
although
the
form
of
retaliation
is
not
yet
clear
the
options
available
to
beijing
include
boycotting
american
goods
selling
off
treasury
holdings
or
sharply
devaluing
the
yuan
xiao
minjie
senior
economist
at
smbc
nikko
securities
in
tokyo
wrote
in
a
note
china
s
yuan
had
strengthened
percent
overnight
though
partially
recovering
from
a
big
slide
the
previous
day
and
after
the
the
people
s
bank
of
china
set
an
official
currency
level
that
was
not
as
weak
as
some
traders
had
feared
it
shows
the
central
bank
intends
to
stabilise
the
market
and
calm
investors
speculation
on
the
yuan
s
depreciation
is
not
in
chinese
authorities
interests
said
qi
gao
asia
fx
strategist
at
scotiabank
in
singapore
the
dollar
index
against
a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
was
up
at
after
gaining
percent
overnight
against
the
yen
which
usually
strengthens
in
times
of
political
tension
and
market
turmoil
the
greenback
stretched
its
overnight
rally
and
rose
to

its
highest

january

as
the
australian
dollar

deep
losses
on

the

also
shade

previous
