in

which
were
also
boosted
by

woes
the

for
the
full

the

which
it
exited
in

the
impact
of
a
drought
in
argentina
and
volatility
in
financial
and
commodity
markets
sparked
by
trade
disputes
between
the
united
states
and
top
commerce
partners
china
and
mexico
helped
cargill
s
grain
trading
unit
to
its
strongest
showing
in
seven
years
years
of
global
oversupply
have
depressed
grains
prices
and
made
it
difficult
for
top
agricultural
grains
merchants
such
as
cargill
to
turn
a
profit
buying
and
selling
food
staples
such
as
corn
soybeans
and
wheat
but
the
drought
in
argentina
has
eaten
into
the
supply
glut
while
tariffs
have
disrupted
global
grain
flows
giving
merchants
space
to
profit
cargill
s
chief
financial
officer
marcel
smits
warned
that
too
much
volatility
could
be
a
problem
however
the
company
has
mapped
out
plans
internally
to
deal
with
disruptions
to
trade
smits
said
in
an
interview
thursday
but
the
plans
could
quickly
lose
relevance
given
the
speed
at
which
the
trade
disputes
are
developing
we
have
potentially
an
advantage
in
terms
of
anticipating
different
scenarios
but
it
is
hard
to
risk
manage
yourself
through
some
of
that
volatility
smits
said
over
the
past
fiscal
year
the
demand
for
protein
and
animal
feed
was
the
biggest
boost
to
cargill
s
bottom
line
beef
packer
margins
have
hit
historic
highs
due
to
low
cattle
prices
and
strong
retailer

grilling
season
global
demand
for
all
proteins
whether
from
meat
and
poultry
or
aquaculture
and
plants
is
booming
in
emerging
markets
in
asia
and
africa
in
part
due
to
rising
incomes
industry
analysts
say
cargill
has
steadily
expanded
its
portfolio
in
the

in
recent
years
from
investing
in
