the
trump
administration
s
top
diplomat
has
indicated
the
united
states
might
grant
waivers
to
some
countries
allowing
them
to
continue
importing
iranian
crude
when
sanctions
snapback
in
november
there
will
be
a
handful
of
countries
that
come
to
the
united
states
and
ask
for
relief

of

mike
pompeo
said
on
tuesday
in
a
television
interview
with
sky
news
arabia
we
ll
consider
in
a
separate
briefing
for
reporters
travelling
with
the
secretary
a
senior
state
department
official
elaborated
on
recent
discussions
between
diplomats
and
their
saudi
counterparts
in
our
meeting
with
the
saudi
energy
minister
we
discussed
maintaining
a
oil
market
to
guard
against
volatility
the
unnamed
official
told
reporters
in
a
background
briefing
we
coordinated
we
discussed
oil
sanctions
to
deny
iran
revenue
to
finance
terrorism
we
talked
about
minimizing
market
disruptions
and
helping
partners
find
alternatives
to
iranian
supply
of
oil
the
official
added
it
remains
unclear
whether
the
latest
comments
from
pompeo
about
considering
applications
for
waivers
and
his
unnamed
briefer
represent
a
softening
of
the
administration
s
position
press
briefings
given
earlier
this
month
suggested
that
the
administration
s
goal
was
to
reduce
iran
s
oil
exports
to
zero
possibly
with
effect
from
november
our
goal
is
to
increase
pressure
on
the
iranian
regime
by
reducing
to
zero
its
revenue
from
crude
oil
sales
a
senior
state
department
official
told
reporters
at
a
press
briefing
earlier
this
month
we
are
working
to
minimize
disruptions
to
the
global
market
but
we
are
confident
that
there
is
sufficient
global
spare
oil
production
capacity
brian
hook
the
director
of
policy
planning
said
on
july
we
are
not
looking
to
grant
licences
or
waivers
broadly
on
the
of
sanctions
because
we
believe
pressure
is
critical
to
achieve
our
national
security
on
the
other
hand
the
administration
has
also
briefed
journalists
on
background
it
will
review
waiver
applications
on
a
basis
and
work
with
countries
that
are
reducing
their
oil
imports
from
iran
says
to
work
with
allies
to
cut
iran
oil
imports
reuters
june
the
current
position
seems
to
be
that
sanctions
will
definitely
snapback
on
but
the
united
states
will
consider
applications
from
a
handful
of
countries
to
be
allowed
to
continue
importing
some
oil
the
compromise
would
ensure
at
least
some
iranian
oil
continues
reaching
the
global
market
as
it
did
under
the
previous
sanctions
in
force
between
and
there
are
doubts
about
whether
saudi
arabia
and
other
producers
can
increase
output
by
enough
to
cover
all
the
million
barrels
per
day
of
iranian
oil
exports
if
sanctions
attempted
to
push
them
to
zero
waivers
and
exemptions
allowing
at
least
some
iranian
barrels
to
continue
being
exported
may
be
the
only
practical
way
to
sanctions
without
risking
a
sharp
spike
in
oil
prices
price
increases
are
especially
sensitive
at
this
time
because
the
of
sanctions
coincides
with
congressional
elections
on
despite
multiple
briefings
and
statements
by
senior
officials
the
administration
s
policy
on
sanctions
and
oil
supplies
remains
unclear
the
ambiguity
may
be
intentional
to
increase
pressure
on
iran
but
it
is
also
maximising
uncertainty
in
the
oil
market
about
future
supplies
and
is
likely
to
keep
upward
pressure
on
prices
traders
refiners
and
hedge
funds
have
been
left
without
a
clear
picture
of
how
much
oil
will
be
available
to
the
market
towards
the
end
of
the
year
and
into
because
the
oil
market
is
uncertainty
about
supplies
in
the
final
quarter
and
next
year
is
directly
affecting
prices
now
market
participants
will
be
looking
for
clarity
from
the
state
department
on
several
key
issues
as
they
try
to
assess
the
severity
of
sanctions
and
oil
availability
if
the
administration
s
target
is
not
zero
oil
exports
how
much
crude
does
the
united
states
plan
to
allow
iran
s
customers
to
purchase
without
imposing
financial
penalties
on
them
if
there
are
to
be
sanctions
exemptions
which
countries
companies
will
receive
them
on
what
basis
will
they
be
granted
and
will
sanctions
relief
be
conditional
has
the
united
states
reached
an
agreement
with
saudi
arabia
and
perhaps
also
the
united
arab
emirates
kuwait
and
russia
to
offset
the
impact
of
oil
volumes
lost
from
iran
is
the
imposition
of
sanctions
and
granting
of
waivers
being
coordinated
with
the
european
union
especially
france
germany
and
britain
and
with
russia
and
china
under
the
last
round
of
oil
sanctions
in
effect
from
until
early
iran
was
still
able
to
continue
exporting
reduced
volumes
of
crude
amounting
to
around
million
bpd
mostly
to
customers
in
asia
if
the
united
states
plans
to
allow
a
similar
volume
of
exports
this
time
it
would
cut
exports
by
around
million
bpd
but
the
administration
has
given
no
indication
about
likely
export
volumes
beyond
november
last
time
refiners
in
japan
south
korea
india
china
and
turkey
were
among
those
that
continued
importing
limited
volumes
of
iranian
crude
without
financial
penalties
from
the
united
states
in
most
cases
sanctions
exemptions
were
implicitly
or
explicitly
conditional
on
promises
to
reduce
the
volume
of
imported
iranian
crude
over
time
iran
sanctions
congressional
research
service
june
the
administration
has
given
no
indication
of
whether
the
same
countries
will
be
exempted
this
time
and
if
so
on
what
conditions
france
germany
britain
russia
and
china
have
all
pledged
to
uphold
the
nuclear
agreement
which
eased
sanctions
on
iran
in
return
for
limits
on
the
country
s
nuclear
activities
these
five
countries
have
been
negotiating
a
package
of
economic
measures
to
provide
iran
with
an
incentive
to
remain
within
the
agreement
accept
continued
restrictions
on
nuclear
activities
and
permit
inspections
the
contents
of
the
economic
package
have
not
been
published
but
iran
has
indicated
an
early
draft
does
not
go
far
enough
negotiations
over
saving
iranian
nuclear
deal
to
continue
radio
free
europe
july
france
has
indicated
the
package
might
only
be
ready
by
november
and
germany
has
said
it
will
not
be
able
to
fully
compensate
for
the
of
sanctions
the
tougher
the
sanctions
the
more
they
reduce
iran
s
oil
export
revenues
the
more
economic
incentives
that
the
other
foreign
powers
may
need
to
offer
iran
to
persuade
the
country
to
abide
by
the
agreement
there
may
therefore
be
a
link
between
the
waiver
process
between
the
united
states
and
iran
s
refining
customers
on
the
one
hand
and
the
negotiations
the
europeans
russia
and
china
are
holding
with
iran
on
the
other
the
other
awkward
linkage
is
between
sanctions
on
iran
and
the
trade
dispute
with
china
over
intellectual
property
protection
technology
transfers
and
the
bilateral
trade
imbalance
china
is
one
of
the
largest
importers
of
oil
from
both
the
united
states
and
iran
china
has
already
targeted
oil
imports
from
the
united
states
for
retaliation
in
the
trade
dispute
if
china
stops
buying
crude
oil
from
the
united
states
it
will
need
to
find
other
sources
of
supply
one
of
which
might
be
iran
china
s
leaders
must
make
a
tricky
calculation
the
country
might
actually
increase
oil
imports
from
iran
to
express
its
displeasure
with
the
united
states
and
diversify
its
crude
supply
but
that
would
be
provocative
and
risk
secondary
sanctions
being
applied
to
china
s
major
oil
companies
many
of
which
have
business
dealings
with
the
united
states
alternatively
china
could
leave
its
imports
from
iran
unchanged
reduce
them
and
apply
for
waivers
or
cut
them
to
zero
heeding
sanctions
would
avert
a
further
intensification
of
disputes
with
the
united
states
but
reduce
china
s
oil
buying
options
reduce
its
supply
security
and
risk
further
upward
pressure
on
oil
prices
china
has
so
far
matched
actions
at
each
step
of
the
bilateral
trade
dispute
but
it
has
not
sought
to
escalate
the
conflict
so
the
country
may
try
to
avoid
the
provocation
of
increasing
oil
imports
from
iran
if
the
trade
dispute
continues
to
worsen

sanctions
policy
could
become
