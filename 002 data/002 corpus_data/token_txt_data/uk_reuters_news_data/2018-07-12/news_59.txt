concerns

offered
to
the

did
not
violate

are

c
nuclear

to
cost
billion
pounds
and
come
online
in
the
european
commission
cleared
the
project
in
saying
it
did
not
see
any
competition
issues
a
previous
austrian
government
took
issue
with
the
decision
and
filed
a
case
with
the
general
court
in
arguing
that
it
contradicted
eu
policy
of
supporting
renewable
energy
vienna
has
a
policy
of
opposing
nuclear
power
luxembourg
has
also
challenged
the
approval
backed
by
a
group
of
more
than
academics
politicians
and
renewable
energy
officials
who
say
it
distorts
competition
and
flouts
rules
on
government
subsidies
another
contentious
issue
is
the
guaranteed
price
for
electricity
from
the
plants
which
is
higher
than
market
rates
the
general
court
dismissed
austria
s
arguments
against
the
project
the
general
court
confirms
the
decision
by
which
the
commission
approved
the
aid
provided
by
the
uk
in
favour
of
the
hinkley
point
c
nuclear
power
station
judges
said
the
judges
said
britain
has
the
right
to
choose
between
the
different
energy
sources
the
plant
is
expected
to
provide
percent
of
britain
s
power
needs
while
helping
to
replace
the
country
s
ageing
nuclear
fleet
and
closing
coal
plants
the
commission
did
not
err
in
taking
the
view
that
the
uk
was
entitled
to
define
the
development
of
nuclear
energy
as
being
a
objective
even
though
that
objective
is
not
shared
by
all
of
the
member
states
the
court
said
in
addition
eu
regulators
were
correct
to
allow
british
state
aid
for
the
project
because
of
the
lack
of
financial
instruments
and
other
contracts
to
hedge
against
the
substantial
investment
risks
in
the
project
it
said
austria
s
ministry
for
sustainability
and
tourism
said
it
regretted
the
judgement
which
sends
a
wrong
signal
about
subsidies
for
building
nuclear
power
plants
the
reasons
for
rejecting
the
lawsuit
against
hinkley
point
c
will
now
be
carefully
examined
and
the
austrian
government
will
then
decide
on
a
timely
appeal
it
said
an
appeal
can
be
made
to
the
eu
court
of
justice
but
only
on
matters
of
law
austria
is
sticking
to
its
challenge
against
another
nuclear
project
approved
by
the
commission
the
paks
power
plant
in
hungary
near
to
the
austrian
border
despite
the
hinkley

legal
setback
