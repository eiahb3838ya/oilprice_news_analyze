update 8-trump claims nato victory after ultimatum to go it alone
brussels
reuters
donald
trump
gave
an
angry
ultimatum
to
european
allies
on
thursday
warning
a
nato
summit
the
united
states
could
withdraw
its
support
and
sparking
crisis
talks
which
the
president
said
produced
big
new
defence
spending
pledges
other
leaders
however
played
down
the
extent
to
which
they
went
beyond
existing
commitments
to
increase
contributions
to
their
own
defence
as
trump
demanded
they
share
more
of
what
he
calls
an
unfair
burden
on
taxpayers
in
funding
an
alliance
focused
on
discouraging
pressure
from
a
resurgent
moscow
in
a
meeting
with
nato
leaders
trump
said
that
if
european
governments
did
not
spend
more
on
defence
the
united
states
would
have
to
look
to
go
its
own
way
according
to
one
diplomatic
source
present
in
the
room
trump
delivered
the
line
after
what
several
sources
said
was
an
improvised
rant
focussed
on
his
grievances
about
transatlantic
ties
but
appeared
to
hesitate
before
issuing
his
ultimatum
which
led
to
some
confusion
about
what
he
really
meant
french
president
emmanuel
macron
and
others
said
they
did
not
hear
in
trump
s
warning
a
direct
threat
to
quit
nato
though
the
words
did
cause
alarm
and
trump
himself
later
said
such
a
move
would
be
unnecessary
the
early
morning
drama
was
part
of
two
days
of
diplomatic
theatre
in
brussels
as
allies
tried
to
shield
a
world
order
from
his
america
first
demands
it
was
unclear
anything
concrete
changed
although
nato
s
chief
jens
stoltenberg
spoke
of
a
new
sense
of
urgency
a
month
after
he
walked
out
of
a
economic
summit
amid
rows
about
new
tariffs
that
have
provoked
fears
of
global
trade
war
trump
was
already
at
the
centre
of
a
storm
from
the
start
of
the
nato
summit
on
wednesday
he
accused
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
of
being
beholden
to
moscow
due
to
energy
imports
while
letting
americans
pay
for
protecting
germany
from
russia
that
tension
seemed
to
calm
during
a
gala
dinner
but
that
did
not
last
trump
tweeted
out
more
of
his
anger
overnight
saying
billions
of
dollars
in
new
spending
by
nato
allies
since
last
year
isn
t
nearly
enough
when
the
summit
resumed
for
a
session
with
the
leaders
of
ukraine
and
georgia
trump
failed
to
appear
for
nearly
an
hour
officials
said
and
when
he
did
he
soon
used
his
turn
to
speak
to
stray
from
the
scheduled
topic
and
to
return
to
his
budget
complaints
in
even
stronger
language
people
present
said
he
raged
that
allies
notably
germany
did
not
make
vast
increases
in
their
defence
budgets
pledges
to
spend
percent
of
national
income
on
defence
by
must
be
met
by
january
he
said
a
dizzying
idea
for
many
countries
which
currently
spend
just
half
that
another
nato
diplomat
said
trump
trampled
on
protocol
by
pointing
at
some
leaders
he
said
were
not
spending
enough
and
addressing
merkel
by
her
first
name
referring
to
her
as
you
angela
stoltenberg
stepping
in
not
for
the
first
time
as
peacemaker
between
trump
and
the
other
called
a
special
session
the
first
in
a
decade
with
most
officials
and
the
invited
guests
ushered
out
to
allow
the
alliance
s
principal
leaders
to
remonstrate
with
trump
merkel
facing
domestic
political
opposition
to
pushing
defence
spending
up
from
percent
of
gdp
said
she
explained
to
trump
how
much
was
already
being
done
nato
has
spent
an
extra
billion
on
defence
since
after
russia
seized
crimea
from
ukraine
in
macron
said
he
had
just
agreed
a
budget
with
parliament
so
changing
it
was
unrealistic
a
point
trump
later
said
he
had
accepted
though
he
still
expected
all
members
to
hit
the
percent
target
in
the
next
years
and
then
possibly
double
that
i
let
them
know
that
i
was
extremely
unhappy
an
ebullient
trump
told
reporters
afterwards
but
he
added
that
the
talks
had
ended
on
good
terms
everybody
in
that
room
got
along
and
they
agreed
to
pay
more
and
they
agreed
to
pay
it
more
in
a
characteristically
freewheeling
news
conference
at
nato
headquarters
covering
his
impending
visit
to
britain
talks
with
russian
president
vladimir
putin
on
monday
iran
china
and
his
father
and
mother
s
european
roots
trump
also
returned
to
a
favoured
theme
he
linked
calls
for
higher
defence
spending
to
complaints
about
germany
s
trade
surplus
and
renewed
a
threat
to
raise
tariffs
on
cars
if
trade
terms
do
not
change
stoltenberg
a
former
norwegian
premier
who
trump
said
gave
him
total
credit
for
a
successful
summit
told
reporters
we
had
a
very
frank
and
open
discussion
that
discussion
has
made
nato
stronger
it
has
created
a
new
sense
of
merkel
was
among
those
however
who
gave
little
indication
that
anything
concretely
new
had
been
pledged
by
those
present
the
american
president
demanded
what
has
been
discussed
for
months
that
there
is
a
change
in
the
i
made
clear
that
we
are
on
this
path
she
said
a
day
after
having
to
challenge
trump
s
suggestion
german
imports
of
russian
gas
meant
that
her
country
was
totally
controlled
by
russia
macron
said
france
which
last
year
spent
percent
on
defence
would
meet
the
target
by
the
deadline
for
many
of
those
present
trump
s
demands
that
they
move
closer
to
the
percent
of
gdp
washington
spends
on
the
world
s
most
powerful
military
make
little
sense
even
if
we
had
the
money
what
would
spend
it
on
one
nato
diplomat
said
in
the
case
of
germany
a
lot
of
european
countries
would
be
very
uncomfortable
with
that
level
of
spending
the
diplomat
added
a
nod
to
the
world
war
two
aggression
that
was
to
lead
to
nato
s
creation
it
would
be
armed
