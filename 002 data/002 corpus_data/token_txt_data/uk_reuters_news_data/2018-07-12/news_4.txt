exclusive-u.s. and europe clash over global supersonic jet noise standards
reuters
a
push
for
new
global
standards
to
kickstart
its
fledgling
supersonic
jet
industry
is
facing
resistance
by
european
nations
that
want
tough
rules
on
noise
according
to
documents
and
people
familiar
with
the
situation
fifteen
years
after
concorde
s
last
flight
regulators
are
weighing
rule
changes
to
allow
testing
of
supersonic
jets
amid
plans
for
business
and
small
passenger
jets
due
in
service
by
the
full
story
but
the
new
industry
could
face
delays
at
the
united
nations
aviation
agency
where
the
united
states
and
european
countries
including
france
germany
and
britain
are
squaring
off
over
new
noise
rules
needed
for
the
jets
to
fly
five
sources
told
reuters
speaking
about
confidential
talks
on
condition
of
anonymity
the
previously
unreported
dispute
follows
a
clash
on
noise
standards
when
the
european
union
wanted
to
ban
noisy
older
jets
like
the
boeing
from
its
airports
and
washington
threatened
to
retaliate
by
banning
the
concorde
this
latest
round
pits
ambitions
for
an
revival
of
supersonic
jets
by
aerion
supersonic

against
european
fears

boom
will
be
making
its
first
appearance
at
the
farnborough
airshow
next
week
as
it
looks
to
cement
the
revival
of
the
supersonic
industry
which
is
struggling
to
design
jets
that
meet
current
subsonic
noise
standards
due
to
engine
constraints
the
politics
are
that
europe
is
way
more
worried
about
noise
around
airports
said
an
industry
source
familiar
with
the
matter
europe
has
a
problem
but
they
have
no
reason
to
solve
it
because
they
have
no
industry
pushing
for
that
s
a
reversal
of
disputes
which
delayed
the
beginning
of
concorde
s
transatlantic
services
in
the
as
first
the
congress
and
then
the
new
york
port
authority
banned
it
due
to
noise
the
federal
aviation
administration
faa
has
banned
supersonic
flights
over
land
since
for
now
the
new
jets
plan
to
stick
to
routes
though
the
faa
will
eventually
decide
whether
to
allow
overland
flights
after
analysing
data
from
nasa
in
a
study
by
both
boeing
and
airbus
have
mapped
out
futuristic
visions
for
air
travel
but
since
the
demise
of
boeing
s
planned
sonic
cruiser
in
the
world
s
two
largest
planemakers
have
focused
on
slower
planes
that
allow
airlines
to
lower
ticket
prices
now
startups
are
working
to
develop
quieter
and
more
supersonic
planes
than
concorde
aimed
at
business
travellers
they
claim
these
can
be
economically
viable
with
the
right
engine
they
also
pledge
to
dampen
the
famous
sonic
boom
which
depressed
concorde
s
sales
and
restricted
its
operations
until
it
was
grounded
for
economic
reasons
in
the
united
nations
international
civil
aviation
organization
icao
which
sets
many
global
standards
has
started
looking
at
supersonic
jets
by
seeking
technical
information
from
planemakers
icao
will
then
be
in
a
better
position
to
assess
options
for
standards
on
noise
and
emissions
and
how
long
the
process
should
take
a
spokesman
said
while
the
aviation
industry
prefers
to
have
common
international
rules
developed
through
icao
the
faa
said
on
thursday
it
is
also
looking
at
domestic
noise
requirements
in
the
event
of
a
delay
in
the
adoption
of
international
standards
the
faa
will
need
to
establish
noise
regulations
for
domestic
certification
it
said
the
european
countries
think
current
noise
limits
should
be
used
as
guidelines
for
developing
landing
and
rules
according
to
a
document
presented
to
a
recent
icao
committee
meeting
and
seen
by
reuters
the
united
states
echoing
industry
s
demand
has
called
for
new
standards
that
reflect
fundamental
differences
between
subsonic
and
supersonic
jets
according
to
a
second
document
you
can
t
try
to
shoehorn
a
supersonic
aircraft
into
a
subsonic
standard
said
mike
hinderberger
aerion
senior
vice
president
of
aircraft
development
at
an
industry
conference
last
month
full
story
aerion
declined
to
comment
further
it
s
not
yet
clear
how
other
countries
see
supersonics
or
whether
icao
could
craft
a
compromise
lengthy
delays
by
icao
would
likely
force
planemakers
to
hold
off
or
risk
investing
millions
in
a
design
that
no
one
will
certify
said
a
industry
source
it
s
a
chicken
and
egg
argument
added
the
first
industry
source
how
can
you
bring
a
plane
to
market
if
you
don
t
have
the
standards
to
meet
noise
standards
need
to
be
defined
as
soon
as
practicable
so
that
manufacturers
have
certainty
said
the
faa
the
sooner
the
agencies
finalise
guidelines
and
standards
the
sooner
we
can
ensure
our
design
meets
those
requirements
said
vik
kachoria
ceo
of
spike
aerospace
which
hopes
to
select
an
engine
for
its
jet
early
next
year
the
european
nations
however
are
seeking
robust
data
in
a
separate
document
on
emissions
they
said
they
do
not
expect
new
standards
before
or
later
because
of
insufficient
data
boom
ceo
blake
scholl
said
he
had
faith
that
the
international
community
would
ultimate
reach
agreement
on
supersonic
noise
standards
due
in
part
to
customer
demand
to
get
to
destinations
faster
supersonic
flight
will
be
a
critical
driver
of
human
progress
and
we
believe
europe
s
citizens
will
embrace
it
he
said
we
know
noise
is
a
sensitive
issue
and
we
are
designing
with
that
