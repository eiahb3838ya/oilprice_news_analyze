was
the
second
biggest
monthly
cut
to
soybean
exports
in
august
usda
cut
its
soybean
export
forecast
by

rally
in
prices
that
chilled
demand
usda
also
lowered
its
end
stocks
outlook
for
the
crop
year
which
ends
on
to
million
bushels
from

increases
in
demand
by
crushers
and
higher
exports
in
the
current
marketing
year

also
raised
its

for
the
soybean
