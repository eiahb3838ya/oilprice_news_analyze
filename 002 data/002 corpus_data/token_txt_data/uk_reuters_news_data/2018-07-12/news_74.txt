nato
leaders
will
try
on
thursday
to
move
beyond
president
donald
trump
s
demands
for
higher
defence
spending
and
focus
on
ending
the
long
war
in
afghanistan
in
the
second
day
of
a
summit
in
brussels
underscored
by
transatlantic
tensions
on
a
trip
that
will
also
take
trump
to
britain
and
to
helsinki
to
meet
russia
s
vladimir
putin
the
president
spent
the
first
day
of
the
nato
summit
lambasting
allies
for
failing
to
spend
the
targeted
percent
of
gdp
on
defence
and
accused
germany
of
being
a
prisoner
to
russian
energy
trump
in
a
post
on
twitter
wrote
billions
of
additional
dollars
are
being
spent
by
nato
countries
since
my
visit
last
year
at
my
request
but
it
isn
t
nearly
enough
spends
too
it
followed
an
uncomfortable
first
round
at
the
summit
where
anxious
western
allies
were
subjected
to
the
president
s
america
first
approach
his
comment
that
germany
was
controlled
by
russia
earned
a
rebuke
from
berlin
on
day
two
leaders
will
welcome
partners
including
afghan
president
ashraf
ghani
and
ukraine
s
petro
poroshenko
to
the
alliance
s
new
headquarters
as
they
seek
to
focus
on
policy
rather
than
politics
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
tried
to
set
the
tone
on
wednesday
by
announcing
more
troops
for
nato
s
afghan
training
mission
we
will
be
deploying
an
additional
personnel
to
nato
s
resolute
support
mission
in
afghanistan
and
i
think
that
shows
when
nato
calls
the
uk
is
one
of
the
first
to
step
up
may
told
reporters
north
atlantic
treaty
organization
chief
jens
stoltenberg
wants
leaders
to
agree
to
fund
afghan
security
forces
until
despite
public
fatigue
in
western
countries
about
their
involvement
in
the
conflict
funding
has
averaged
at
about
billion
annually
and
stoltenberg
has
said
he
expected
that
level
to
be
met
leaders
will
be
keen
to
hear
more
about
trump
s
military
approach
to
afghanistan
which
he
revamped
last
august
to
include
a
surge
in
air
strikes
to
force
taliban
militants
to
the
negotiating
table
officials
have
told
reuters
that
washington
is
preparing
another
review
of
strategy
a
year
after
trump
begrudgingly
agreed
to
extend
involvement
in
the
war
trump
was
opposed
to
remaining
in
america
s
longest
war
but
his
advisers
convinced
him
to
give
it
more
time
he
authorized
the
deployment
of
an
additional
troops
bringing
the
total
to
around
trump
s
late
tweet
also
repeated
his
insistence
from
earlier
in
the
summit
that
germany
was
wrong
to
support
an
billion
baltic
sea
pipeline
to
import
even
more
russian
gas
while
being
slow
to
meet
targets
for
nato
spending
pipeline
dollars
to
russia
are
not
acceptable
he
wrote
but
trump
appeared
earlier
to
substantially
overstate
german
reliance
on
russian
energy
and
to
imply
berlin
was
funding
a
pipeline
that
chancellor
angela
merkel
says
is
a
commercial
venture
having
chided
nato
members
for
failing
to
reach
a
target
of
spending
percent
of
national
income
on
defence
trump
told
fellow
leaders
on
wednesday
he
would
prefer
a
goal
of
percent
similar
to
levels
officials
said
that
would
represent
a
massive
upheaval
of
budgetary
priorities
in
europe
where
germany
and
many
others
have
pledged
only
to
reach
percent
by
or
later
and
it
was
not
clear
what
allies
would
spend
the
money
on
at
the
summit
on
thursday
leaders
will
discuss
ties
with
georgia
and
ukraine
two
nato
membership
hopefuls
that
contribute
to
troop
levels
in
afghanistan
but
have
seen
their
chances
of
joining
the
alliance
hampered
by
russian
incursions
into
their
territory
under
nato
rules
countries
with
territorial
conflicts
can
not
join
the
western
alliance
and
neither
country
is
expected
to
progress
in
membership
talks
macedonia
however
which
was
formally
invited
to
start
accession
talks
on
wednesday
will
be
part
of
