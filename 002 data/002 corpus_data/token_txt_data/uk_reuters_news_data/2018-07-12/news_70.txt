the

had
some
time
to
digest
the
latest
trade
war
developments
and
are
poised
to
begin
consolidating
it
has
become
a
pattern
of
reacting

new

hoping
that

ease

focus
turned
to
the
next
potential
steps
in
the
trade
conflict
china
has
accused
the
united
states
of
bullying
and
warned
it
could
hit
back
although
it
was
unclear
how
it
would
retaliate
the
retaliatory
options
available
to
china
include
boycotting
american
goods
sharply
devaluing
the
yuan
and
selling
off
treasury
holdings
wrote
xiao
minjie
senior
economist
at
smbc
nikko
securities
in
tokyo
but
we
believe
none
of
these
moves
are
realistic
or
productive
wisest
move
in
our
view
is
for
china
to
accelerate
the
opening
of
its
market
rather
than
continue
to
trade
blows
with
the
united
the

against

was
steady

gaining
percent
overnight

usually
gains

times
of
political
tension
and
market
turmoil
the
greenback
stretched
its
overnight
rally
and
rose
to
yen
its
highest
since
january
the
dollar
has
managed
to
gain
even
against
the
yen
due
to
ongoing
trade
concerns
with
currencies
having
slid
along
with
the
downturn
in
commodities

providing
a
broad
lift
for
the
