the
world
s
oil
supply
cushion
could
be
stretched
to
the
limit
due
to
prolonged
outages
supporting
prices
and
threatening
demand
growth
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
thursday
the
expected
drop
in
iranian
crude
exports
this
year
due
to
renewed
sanctions
coupled
with
a
decline
in
venezuela
s
production
and
outages
in
libya
canada
and
the
north
sea
have
driven
oil
prices
to
their
highest
since
in
recent
weeks
opec
and
other
key
producers
including
russia
responded
to
the
tightness
by
easing
a
agreement
with
saudi
arabia
vowing
to
support
the
market
as
president
donald
trump
accused
the
group
of
pushing
prices
higher
the
iea
said
in
its
monthly
oil
markets
report
that
there
were
already
very
welcome
signs
that
output
from
leading
producers
had
been
boosted
and
may
reach
a
record
the
global
energy
watchdog
however
said
the
disruptions
underscored
the
pressure
on
global
supplies
as
the
world
s
spare
production
capacity
cushion
might
be
stretched
to
the
limit
spare
capacity
refers
to
a
producer
s
ability
to
ramp
up
production
in
a
relatively
short
time
much
of
it
is
located
in
the
middle
east
the
iea
said
opec
crude
production
in
june
reached
a
high
of
million
barrels
per
day
spare
capacity
in
the
middle
east
in
july
was
million
bpd
roughly
percent
of
global
output
production
including
from
surging
shale
also
continued
to
rise
but
the
iea
said
that
might
not
be
enough
to
assuage
concerns
this
vulnerability
currently
underpins
oil
prices
and
seems
likely
to
continue
doing
so
we
see
no
sign
of
higher
production
from
elsewhere
that
might
ease
fears
of
market
tightness
it
said
the
iea
maintained
its
oil
demand
growth
forecast
at
million
bpd
but
warned
that
higher
prices
could
dampen
consumption
higher
prices
are
prolonging
the
fears
of
consumers
everywhere
that
their
economies
will
be
damaged
in
turn
this
could
have
a
marked
impact
on
oil
demand
china
and
india
the
world
s
second
and
third
largest
oil
consumers
could
face
major
challenges
in
finding
alternative
crude
oil
following
the
drop
in
iranian
and
venezuelan
exports
