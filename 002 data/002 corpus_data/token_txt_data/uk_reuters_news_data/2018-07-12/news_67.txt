it
has
become
a
pattern
of
reacting
to
each
new
development

hoping
that

the

warned
it
could
hit

the
form
of
retaliation
was
not

the
retaliatory
options
available

china

wrote
in
a
note
but
we
believe
none
of
these
moves
are
realistic
or
productive
the
wisest
move
in
our
view
is
for
china
to
accelerate
the
opening
of
its
market
rather
than
continue
to
trade

the

six
major

times
of

tension

turmoil
the

overnight
rally

rose

its

the
dollar
has
managed
to
gain

the

concerns
with
