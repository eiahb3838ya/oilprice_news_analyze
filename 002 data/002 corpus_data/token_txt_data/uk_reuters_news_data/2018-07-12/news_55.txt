the
kremlin
on
thursday
rejected
president
donald
trump
s
description
of
germany
as
a
captive
of
russia
due
to
its
energy
reliance
saying
moscow
and
berlin
were
equally
dependent
on
each
other
trump
made
the
comments
at
a
nato
summit
in
brussels
on
wednesday
telling
germany
it
was
wrong
to
support
an
baltic
sea
pipeline
to
import
even
more
russian
gas
while
being
slow
to
meet
targets
for
nato
spending
as
for
germany
s
dependence
on
russia
as
a
major
gas
buyer
we
can
not
agree
with
this
premise
kremlin
spokesman
dmitry
peskov
told
reporters
on
a
conference
call
when
asked
about
trump
s
comments
supplies
of
pipeline
gas
do
not
lead
to
dependence
of
one
country
on
another
but
to
complete
mutual
dependence
that
is
a
guarantee
of
stability
and
future
