the
pennsylvania
public
utility
commission
on
thursday
unanimously
rejected
a
petition
by
buckeye
partners
to
reverse
a
western
portion
of
the
laurel
product
pipeline
that
connects
philadelphia
area
refiners
to
the
pittsburgh
market
the
partial
reversal
of
the
traditional
westward
flow
on
of
the
pipeline
to
bring
barrels
per
day
of
fuels
including
gasoline
and
diesel
to
pennsylvania
would
have
given
midwest
refiners
like
marathon
petroleum
corp
and
husky
energy
greater
access
to
the
pittsburgh
market
while
essentially
cutting
off
their
east
coast
peers
midwest
refiners
have
added
nearly
barrels
of
daily
refining
capacity
in
the
last
years
tailoring
their
systems
to
run
crude
out
of
canada
and
north
dakota
s
bakken
shale
oil
field
the
investments
have
increased
fuel
production
creating
a
need
for
new
markets
the
commission
agreed
with
a
previous
administrative
law
judge
opinion
that
said
the
partial
reversal
threatened
consumers
and
the
state
s
two
east
coast
refineries
buckeye
argued
there
was
more
demand
from
midwest
refiners
than
from
east
coast
refiners
for
pipeline
capacity
so
reversing
the
line
made
the
most
commercial
sense
the
company
did
not
provide
any
evidence
that
it
couldn
t
achieve
the
same
goals
by
increasing
rates
puc
chairwoman
gladys
brown
said
before
casting
her
vote
to
reject
the
petition
the
vote
ends
buckeye
s
bid
at
the
state
level
to
partially
reverse
the
line
but
it
recently
submitted
a
slightly
different
petition
to
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
in
that
petition
buckeye
is
now
proposing
to
allow
the
western
section
of
the
pipeline
to
move
in
both
directions
though
not
at
the
same
time
giving
east
coast
refiners
limited
access
to
the
pittsburgh
market
in
a
statement
buckeye
said
they
disagree
with
the
puc
decision
and
still
believe
it
would
provide
state
consumers
with
greater
access
to
cheaper
fuels
service
will
enhance
competition
and
provide
shippers
and
suppliers
with
more
options
the
company
said
buckeye
requested
that
ferc
act
on
the
petition
no
later
than
july
and
ferc
has
not
yet
ruled
on
the
issue
some
refiners
such
as
philadelphia
energy
solutions
and
delta
air
lines
subsidiary
monroe
energy
opposed
the
reversal
saying
it
would
harm
their
business
and
lead
to
closures
buckeye
argues
that
midwest
shippers
and
refiners
have
urged
expansion
of
its
pipeline
network
into
central
pennsylvania

company
