insight-south africa's ramaphosa embarks on eskom overhaul
johannesburg
reuters
a
month
after
cyril
ramaphosa
took
the
helm
of
south
africa
s
ruling
african
national
congress
anc
in
december
he
called
an
urgent
meeting
with
jacob
zuma
and
senior
ministers
to
save
state
power
firm
eskom
ramaphosa
understood
sweeping
changes
were
needed
at
the
struggling
utility
company
he
persuaded
zuma
to
replace
eskom
s
board
and
name
a
new
chief
executive
to
appease
investors
such
as
the
world
bank
according
to
an
official
at
the
meeting
it
was
ramaphosa
s
first
major
policy
intervention
since
becoming
anc
leader
and
signaled
a
determination
to
reform
eskom
a
company
nearing
breaking
point
after
a
string
of
corruption
scandals
during
zuma
s
nine
years
in
office
eskom
is
critical
to
south
africa
it
supplies
more
than
percent
of
the
country
s
power
has
billion
rand
billion
of
debt
and
is
often
cited
as
a
threat
to
south
africa
s
credit
ratings
which
are
near
junk
status
if
eskom
were
to
collapse
it
would
be
a
catastrophe
for
generations
to
come
said
the
official
who
declined
to
be
named
ramaphosa
explained
to
zuma
that
it
was
time
to
ramaphosa
still
faces
a
battle
keeping
eskom
afloat
new
instances
of
fraud
under
the
firm
s
previous
management
are
still
being
uncovered
a
sluggish
economy
means
demand
for
power
is
tepid
and
powerful
labor
unions
are
likely
to
resist
change
but
what
may
help
ramaphosa
is
a
realization
in
the
upper
echelons
of
the
anc
that
eskom
is
no
longer
untouchable
sources
in
the
ruling
party
said
since
replacing
zuma
as
president
in
february
ramaphosa
has
pressed
on
with
reform
surprising
many
with
the
speed
at
which
he
is
addressing
problems
at
eskom
that
have
festered
for
years
ramaphosa
appointed
respected
former
finance
minister
pravin
gordhan
to
guide
turnaround
efforts
directed
new
executives
to
produce
a
plan
to
stabilize
the
company
s
finances
and
halted
a
nuclear
deal
supported
by
zuma
that
could
have
saddled
eskom
with
billions
of
dollars
of
additional
debt
asked
for
comment
about
ramaphosa
s
role
in
efforts
to
reform
eskom
his
spokeswoman
khusela
diko
said
the
president
met
regularly
with
gordhan
to
discuss
eskom
and
that
revamping
the
company
was
a
priority
a
spokesman
for
zuma
was
not
available
for
comment
eskom
also
employs
people
and
has
powerful
labor
unions
some
allied
with
the
anc
and
others
more
militant
that
have
said
they
will
resist
attempts
to
cut
the
workforce
and
fight
moves
to
privatize
the
company
however
anc
sources
say
ramaphosa
has
secured
the
backing
of
senior
figures
in
the
ruling
party
for
a
radical
overhaul
of
eskom
one
which
will
involve
attracting
greater
private
investment
into
the
electricity
supply
industry
from
an
ideological
standpoint
eskom
presents
a
real
challenge
for
the
anc
said
a
source
in
the
anc
executive
close
to
ramaphosa
greater
private
sector
involvement
does
not
sit
well
with
some
in
the
party
but
there
is
no
other
the
official
involved
in
the
meeting
with
zuma
who
holds
a
senior
position
in
the
anc
said
there
had
been
a
discussion
about
which
assets
should
be
considered
and
sold
the
idea
that
outside
investors
may
be
needed
to
save
the
company
is
a
dramatic
shift
for
a
political
party
that
has
rejected
any
form
of
privatization
of
eskom
for
years
the
desire
for
change
is
partly
driven
by
a
realization
that
eskom
is
more
fragile
than
many
believed
the
situation
came
to
a
head
in
november
when
the
world
bank
held
a
flurry
of
meetings
with
senior
government
officials
eskom
had
less
than
billion
rand
of
cash
commercial
banks
had
suspended
lending
and
government
officials
feared
the
world
bank
might
do
the
same
at
a
time
when
south
africa
s
last
credit
ratings
were
hanging
by
a
thread
eskom
spokesman
khulu
phasiwe
said
the
world
bank
expressed
concerns
on
progress
made
on
a
specific
project
at
a
meeting
with
eskom
executives
and
also
raised
governance
concerns
but
had
not
told
the
company
it
planned
to
withdraw
funding
a
senior
world
bank
official
said
eskom
which
has
borrowed
billion
from
the
bank
for
projects
including
the
medupi
plant
and
renewables
ventures
had
not
defaulted
on
world
bank
loans
and
the
lender
did
not
threaten
to
suspend
lending
for
a
graphic
of
eskom
financial
woes
while
commercial
banks
resumed
lending
when
zuma
stepped
down
and
the
company
finally
published
financial
results
ramaphosa
has
since
faced
more
eskom
challenges
workers
went
on
strike
in
june
over
pay
forcing
the
utility
to
cut
power
supplies
over
three
days
for
the
first
time
since
when
rolling
blackouts
cost
the
economy
billions
of
dollars
a
month
as
south
africans
huddled
around
candles
again
commentators
joked
that
ramaphosa
s
pledge
to
usher
in
a
new
dawn
after
a
decade
of
stagnation
had
turned
into
a
new
dusk
eskom
had
proposed
a
wage
freeze
due
to
financial
constraints
even
though
inflation
is
running
at
about
percent
the
unions
were
holding
out
for
an
increase
of
at
least
percent
in
an
increasingly
acrimonious
dispute
ramaphosa
used
his
close
ties
to
south
africa
s
largest
union
federation
cosatu
congress
of
south
african
trade
unions
to
make
headway
and
in
what
was
seen
by
unions
as
an
unusual
move
gordhan
intervened
personally
gordhan
called
cosatu
to
a
meeting
last
month
and
promised
that
eskom
would
rethink
its
refusal
to
raise
wages
setting
the
stage
for
a
deal
of
about
percent
that
is
being
ironed
out
it
was
unprecedented
that
minister
gordhan
met
us
to
unlock
the
dispute
said
sdumo
dlamini
president
of
cosatu
which
has
more
than
members
at
eskom
via
its
national
union
of
mineworkers
num
affiliate
the
talks
were
constructive
and
we
agreed
to
meet
again
to
discuss
ramaphosa
formerly
held
a
senior
position
in
num
and
cosatu
supported
his
bid
to
become
anc
leader
while
ramaphosa
s
resolve
to
fix
eskom
doesn
t
seem
in
doubt
most
analysts
believe
it
will
still
take
time
after
the
maladministration
and
corruption
under
the
previous
management
the
new
board
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
said
ronald
chauke
energy
portfolio
manager
at
south
africa
s
organisation
undoing
tax
abuse
but
it
will
take
five
to
years
to
restructure
eskom
properly
ramaphosa
will
need
a
war
room
to
fix
the
attempts
to
sell
off
parts
of
eskom
will
be
vehemently
opposed
by
some
labor
unions
and
conservative
sections
of
the
anc
wary
of
relinquishing
control
over
parts
of
the
power
grid
the
national
union
of
metalworkers
of
south
africa
numsa
a
militant
group
with
several
thousand
eskom
workers
has
called
for
a
meeting
with
gordhan
finance
minister
nhlanhla
nene
and
other
unions
to
discuss
eskom
we
are
vigilant
about
plans
to
restructure
state
firms
because
that
usually
leads
to
job
losses
numsa
general
secretary
irvin
jim
said
we
reject
privatizing
eskom
with
the
contempt
it
analysts
say
any
cuts
to
eskom
s
bloated
workforce
are
likely
to
be
delayed
until
after
next
year
s
national
election
where
high
unemployment
will
be
a
issue
but
ramaphosa
who
played
a
key
role
in
talks
to
end
white
minority
rule
more
than
two
decades
ago
has
a
reputation
for
making
headway
in
difficult
negotiations
ramaphosa
could
also
reduce
eskom
s
debt
without
incurring
the
wrath
of
opponents
of
privatization
by
converting
debt
held
by
the
public
investment
corporation
pic
which
invests
government
employees
pension
money
into
equity
said
analysts
the
pic
held
more
than
billion
rand
of
eskom
debt
last
year
ramaphosa
won
t
make
quick
progress
with
the
radical
restructuring
needed
to
shore
up
eskom
s
balance
sheet
as
he
balances
divergent
interests
in
the
anc
before
the
election
said
darias
jonker
director
for
africa
at
eurasia
group
but
he
will
get
there
