trump brings reality-show style to nato, and leaves satisfied
brussels
reuters
he
came
he
raged
he
claimed
victory
he
left
president
donald
trump
brought
his
chaotic
style
of
governing
to
the
nato
summit
in
brussels
on
wednesday
and
thursday
irritating
and
befuddling
allies
with
charges
and
jibes
before
declaring
success
for
convincing
his
counterparts
to
pay
more
for
their
mutual
defence
it
was
a
classic
performance
for
the
reality
television
star
whose
america
first
mantra
has
translated
into
a
style
on
the
world
stage
particularly
with
countries
traditionally
considered
to
be
friends
even
before
the
nato
summit
was
underway
he
kicked
off
the
summit
with
a
broadside
against
germany
over
plans
for
a
natural
gas
pipeline
with
russia
and
he
stepped
up
his
criticism
of
the
alliance
as
a
whole
for
not
taking
more
of
the
financial
burden
off
the
united
states
he
reinforced
that
tension
through
critical
tweets
even
as
he
held
polite
talks
with
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
on
the
sidelines
of
the
summit
and
made
nice
with
other
world
leaders
at
a
reception
on
wednesday
night
he
was
in
a
good
mood
he
said
europe
was
a
continent
he
appreciated
luxembourg
s
prime
minister
xavier
bettel
said
of
trump
at
the
evening
event
at
which
leaders
enjoyed
an
acrobatic
display
and
saxophone
music
in
a
brussels
park
but
the
next
morning
the
bad
guy
persona
was
back
prompting
the
first
formal
nato
crisis
meeting
since
in
which
trump
aired
his
grievances
in
a
unscripted
session
over
the
funding
issue
again
diplomats
said
one
diplomat
said
something
appeared
to
have
irritated
trump
a
suggestion
from
another
leader
or
possibly
a
report
in
the
news
media
that
he
had
not
gotten
his
way
when
he
took
the
floor
in
the
north
atlantic
council
room
for
a
session
with
members
georgia
and
ukraine
trump
began
a
tirade
which
several
diplomats
said
became
a
rage
he
made
very
clear
attacks
against
germany
and
warned
that
if
nato
countries
did
not
meet
a
goal
of
raising
their
defence
spending
to
two
percent
of
their
national
gdp
by
january
the
united
states
would
go
it
alone
that
outburst
prompted
nato
jens
stoltenberg
to
ask
ukraine
and
georgia
to
leave
the
room
and
in
a
closed
session
to
try
to
get
the
summit
back
on
track
trump
continued
his
now
familiar
verbal
attacks
saying
too
many
presidents
had
failed
to
get
europeans
to
spend
more
on
defence
and
that
he
wanted
immediate
results
but
french
president
emmanuel
macron
with
whom
trump
is
friendly
fought
back
and
said
the
allies
had
to
stick
to
the
target
for
their
defence
spending
increases
he
could
not
change
france
s
budget
for
next
year
which
he
had
just
presented
to
parliament
merkel
said
it
was
completely
impossible
to
meet
the
commitments
by
january
in
the
crisis
session
that
trump
himself
later
publicly
described
as
tough
for
a
while
it
wasn
t
easy
for
merkel
and
the
germans
to
be
treated
as
a
villain
said
a
nato
diplomat
adding
that
the
overall
mood
within
the
organisation
was
that
this
was
the
new
by
the
end
of
that
meeting
despite
the
pushback
trump
felt
victorious
during
a
news
conference
at
nato
headquarters
the
president
declared
that
all
was
well
and
he
believed
in
nato
he
said
he
was
proud
that
his
intervention
had
prodded
other
nations
to
step
up
their
spending
and
with
his
opinions
on
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
at
that
news
conference
trump
even
forced
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
into
a
public
defence
of
her
policies
and
to
come
out
to
speak
to
reporters
diplomats
said
we
ve
had
a
very
amazing
period
in
brussels
trump
told
reporters
everyone
has
agreed
to
substantially
up
their
commitment
they
re
going
to
up
it
at
levels
that
they
ve
never
thought
of
in
fact
allies
had
agreed
to
stick
to
the
goals
that
had
already
been
set
before
trump
became
president
and
which
nato
officials
say
have
much
more
to
do
with
fear
of
russia
than
of
the
president
but
trump
was
satisfied
at
least
for
the
time
being
and
now
we
re
very
happy
and
have
a
very
very
powerful
very
very
strong
nato
much
stronger
than
it
was
two
days
ago
