intense
heat
and
water
shortages
raised
fears
of
disease
outbreaks
in
western
japan
on
thursday
as
the
death
toll
from
the
worst
weather
disaster
in
years
neared
more
than
households
had
no
water
a
week
after
torrential
rains
caused
floods
and
set
off
landslides
across
western
japan
bringing
death
and
destruction
to
communities
built
on
mountain
slopes
and
flood
plains
the
death
toll
rose
to
with
several
dozen
people
still
missing
the
government
said
on
thursday
with
daily
temperatures
above
celsius
fahrenheit
and
high
humidity
life
in
school
gymnasiums
and
other
evacuation
centres
where
families
spread
out
on
mats
on
the
floors
began
to
take
a
toll
television
footage
showed
one
elderly
woman
trying
to
sleep
by
kneeling
with
her
upper
body
on
the
seat
of
a
folding
chair
arms
over
her
eyes
to
keep
out
the
light
with
few
portable
fans
in
the
evacuation
centres
many
survivors
tried
to
cool
themselves
with
paper
fans
the
limited
water
supply
meant
that
people
are
not
getting
enough
fluids
and
in
danger
of
suffering
from
heatstroke
authorities
said
people
are
also
reluctant
to
use
what
water
they
do
have
to
wash
their
hands
raising
fears
of
epidemics
without
water
we
can
t
really
clean
anything
up
we
can
t
wash
anything
one
man
told
nhk
television
the
government
has
sent
water
trucks
to
the
disaster
area
but
supplies
remain
limited
more
than
military
police
and
firefighters
toiled
through
the
debris
in
a
grim
search
for
the
missing
some
teams
shovelled
dirt
into
sacks
and
piled
the
bags
into
trucks
others
used
diggers
and
chainsaws
to
work
through
landslides
and
splintered
buildings
many
areas
were
buried
deep
in
mud
that
smelled
like
sewage
and
had
hardened
in
the
heat
making
the
search
more
difficult
disasters
set
off
by
torrential
rains
have
become
more
frequent
in
japan
perhaps
due
to
global
warming
experts
say
dozens
of
people
died
after
similar
rains
caused
flooding
around
the
same
time
last
year
it
s
an
undeniable
fact
that
this
sort
of
disaster
due
to
torrential
unprecedented
rain
is
becoming
more
frequent
in
recent
years
chief
cabinet
secretary
yoshihide
suga
said
at
a
news
conference
in
tokyo
preserving
the
lives
and
peaceful
existence
of
our
citizens
is
the
government
s
biggest
duty
we
recognize
that
there
s
a
need
to
look
into
steps
we
can
take
to
reduce
the
damage
from
disasters
like
this
even
a
little
bit
