iran says u.s.-caused oil spike will slow growth, add to tariff impact
london
reuters
a
rise
in
oil
prices
caused
by
the
united
states
sanctions
policies
will
hurt
economic
growth
in
china
europe
and
other
consumers
much
like
president
donald
trump
s
trade
measures
a
top
iranian
official
said
on
thursday
iran
s
opec
governor
also
told
reuters
the
rise
in
oil
output
by
opec
and
its
allies
after
pressure
by
trump
to
do
so
was
only
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
june
and
would
not
grow
much
in
also
weighing
on
economic
growth
while
trump
has
accused
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
of
driving
up
oil
prices
iran
opec
s
producer
says
the
united
states
has
caused
this
by
imposing
sanctions
on
iran
and
fellow
opec
member
venezuela
the
higher
oil
prices
trump
is
causing
are
leading
to
a
higher
energy
bill
in
the
eu
japan
china
and
india
impacting
their
economic
growth
just
like
the
tariffs
imposed
upon
them
also
enabling
saudi
arabia
and
the
uae
to
pay
their
arms
bill
to
the
iran
s
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
said
the
comments
underline
the
tensions
after
opec
s
meeting
last
month
when
the
group
agreed
to
return
to
full
compliance
with
earlier
agreed
oil
output
cuts
after
months
of
underproduction
by
opec
countries
including
venezuela
saudi
arabia
said
the
deal
allowed
countries
able
to
produce
more
such
as
itself
to
go
ahead
and
do
so
to
make
up
for
shortfalls
elsewhere
iran
strongly
disagreed
and
criticized
saudi
plans
to
boost
output
kazempour
said
trump
may
be
disappointed
by
the
scale
of
the
production
increase
so
far
and
voiced
scepticism
saudi
arabia
and
russia
could
add
much
more
oil
in
these
days
saudi
arabia
are
supplying
out
of
stocks
not
additional
production
he
said
russia
is
also
unable
to
do
much
not
even
barrels
per
day
all
are
talking
few
barrels
next
year
and
the
world
economy
will
shrink
and
all
indexes
will
be
the
june
versus
may
increase
in
opec
and
production
was
only
bpd
does
this
surprise
you
mr
president
the
international
energy
agency
in
a
report
on
thursday
put
the
combined
increase
at
bpd
if
iran
were
able
to
develop
its
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
industry
to
its
full
potential
tehran
could
help
reduce
reliance
on
russia
kazempour
said
something
that
the
united
states
would
favor
trump
is
concerned
about
eu
and
german
dependence
on
russian
gas
why
do
trump
and
american
companies
together
with
eu
companies
not
invest
in
iranian
lng
for
europe
iran
holds
the
largest
gas
the
president
had
launched
a
sharp
public
attack
on
germany
on
wednesday
for
supporting
a
baltic
sea
gas
pipeline
deal
with
russia
saying
berlin
had
become
a
captive
to
russia
