trying
to
rally
enough
votes
at
the
united
nations
security
council
to
impose
an
arms
embargo
on
south
sudan
following
continued
fighting
and
human
rights
abuses
diplomats
said
on
thursday
a
resolution
needs
nine
votes
in
favor
and
no
vetoes
by
russia
china
britain
france
or
the
united
states
the
council
could
vote
as
early
as
friday
diplomats
said
washington
has
secured
at
least
seven
votes
but
some
council
members
say
the
timing
is
not
right
given
attempts
to
revitalize
the
peace
process
the
mission
to
the
united
nations
was
not
immediately
available
to
comment
south
sudan
which
split
off
from
its
northern
neighbor
sudan
in
has
been
gripped
by
a
civil
war
since
caused
by
political
rivalry
between
president
salva
kiir
and
his
former
deputy
riek
machar
last
friday
the
government
and
opposition
signed
an
agreement
on
security
arrangements
which
follow
on
from
a
ceasefire
deal
last
month
however
on
thursday
south
sudan
s
parliament
voted
to
extend
kiir
s
mandate
until
in
a
move
likely
to
undermine
the
peace
talks
as
opposition
groups
have
said
the
change
would
be
illegal
at
the
end
of
may
the
security
council
renewed
its
targeted
sanctions
regime
on
south
sudan
until
july
and
said
it
would
consider
an
arms
embargo
and
blacklisting
six
senior
south
sudan
officials
if
chief
antonio
guterres
reported
by
june
that
there
was
still
conflict
or
a
lack
of
a
viable
political
agreement
that
resolution
was
adopted
with
nine
votes
in
favor
and
six
abstentions
there
have
been
credible
reports
of
fighting
guterres
told
the
security
council
in
a
june
letter
he
also
said
peacekeepers
had
documented
gross
violations
of
international
human
rights
and
humanitarian
law
while
the
outcome
of
regional
and
international
efforts
to
deliver
a
political
settlement
of
the
conflict
is
yet
unclear
i
must
reiterate
that
any
revitalized
agreement
must
be
inclusive
fair
and
sustainable
guterres
wrote
the
human
rights
office
said
on
tuesday
that
at
least
civilians
were
killed
and
women
and
girls
raped
in
scorched
earth
attacks
by
south
sudan
government
troops
and
aligned
forces
in
villages
earlier
