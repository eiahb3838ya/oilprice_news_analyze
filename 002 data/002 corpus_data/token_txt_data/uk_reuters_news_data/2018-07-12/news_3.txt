u.s. sets gulf of mexico oil, gas lease sale despite lackluster demand
washington
reuters
the
department
of
the
interior
said
on
thursday
it
would
hold
a
auction
for
oil
and
gas
leases
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
next
month
in
an
attempt
to
spark
interest
in
offshore
drilling
months
after
a
similar
sale
received
a
weak
response
from
energy
companies
the
sale
to
be
held
on
includes
all
available
unleased
areas
in
federal
waters
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
about
million
acres
million
hectares
off
texas
louisiana
mississippi
alabama
and
florida
it
is
the
third
sale
in
the
agency
s
program
which
aims
to
hold
sales
in
all
the
sale
is
part
of
what
the
interior
department
calls
president
donald
trump
s
offshore
energy
strategy
vincent
devito
an
adviser
to
interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
said
the
sale
is
just
one
piece
of
the
administration
s
comprehensive
effort
to
secure
our
nation
s
energy
the
last
gulf
of
mexico
lease
sale
held
in
march
brought
in
only
million
as
just
percent
of
the
million
acres
million
hectares
offered
found
bidders
in
addition
nearly
all
the
purchases
showed
big
drillers
stuck
closest
to
existing
operations
in
april
zinke
who
had
earlier
proposed
opening
up
nearly
all
the
country
s
coasts
to
drilling
said
the
sale
in
march
held
modest
to
little
interest
from
drillers
and
added
there
was
little
likelihood
for
strong
demand
elsewhere
in
the
country
his
plan
to
open
up
the
pacific
and
atlantic
coasts
was
criticized
by
environmentalists
politicians
and
tourism
and
fishing
interests
the
government
estimates
the
outer
continental
shelf
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
contains
about
billion
barrels
of
undiscovered
technically
recoverable
oil
and
trillion
cubic
feet
of
undiscovered
technically
recoverable
gas
most
of
the
recent
oil
boom
has
occurred
onshore
where
it
is
cheaper
to
drill
than
in
deepwater
in
addition
many
drillers
are
exploring
in
other
places
such
as
mexico
where
energy
reforms
have
brought
in
billions
of
dollars
in
investments
