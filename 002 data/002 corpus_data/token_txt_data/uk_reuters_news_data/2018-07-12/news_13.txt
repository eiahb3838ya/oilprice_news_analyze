the
kremlin
on
thursday
rejected
president
donald
trump
s
description
of
germany
as
a
captive
of
russia
due
to
its
energy
reliance
saying
his
statement
was
part
of
a
campaign
to
bully
europe
into
buying
american
energy
supplies
trump
told
germany
at
a
nato
summit
in
brussels
on
wednesday
that
it
was
wrong
to
support
an
baltic
sea
pipeline
to
import
even
more
russian
gas
while
being
slow
to
meet
nato
targets
for
defence
spending
trump
s
comments
came
ahead
of
his
summit
on
monday
with
russian
president
vladimir
putin
in
helsinki
though
the
kremlin
said
they
were
unlikely
to
have
an
impact
on
what
was
always
going
to
be
a
difficult
meeting
due
to
the
number
of
disagreements
between
the
two
countries
russia
is
keen
to
press
ahead
with
the
nord
stream
pipeline
since
it
has
the
potential
to
double
its
gas
exports
under
the
baltic
sea
to
germany
bypassing
traditional
routes
through
ukraine
with
which
it
has
poor
relations
however
washington
opposes
the
project
and
a
spokesman
for
the
state
department
told
reuters
on
wednesday
that
western
firms
invested
in
the
pipeline
were
at
risk
of
sanctions
kremlin
spokesman
dmitry
peskov
said
trump
s
statement
marked
an
escalation
of
a
campaign
to
talk
down
russian
gas
supplies
to
europe
in
an
attempt
to
push
the
energy
sector
instead
as
for
germany
s
dependence
on
russia
as
a
major
gas
buyer
we
can
not
agree
with
this
premise
peskov
told
reporters
on
a
conference
call
supplies
of
pipeline
gas
do
not
lead
to
dependence
of
one
country
on
another
but
to
complete
mutual
dependence
that
is
a
guarantee
of
stability
and
future
peskov
said
moscow
regarded
objections
to
the
new
pipeline
as
unfair
competition
aimed
at
trying
to
force
european
countries
to
buy
costlier
liquefied
natural
gas
we
consider
that
it
s
a
question
of
economic
competition
and
that
the
buyers
must
take
their
own
decision
he
said
speaking
in
brussels
secretary
of
energy
rick
perry
said
he
had
not
heard
any
of
his
eu
counterparts
talk
positively
about
nord
stream
and
said
washington
didn
t
like
it
because
it
didn
t
promote
diversity
of
supply
the
president
is
pretty
straightforward
about
what
he
believes
and
he
thinks
nord
stream
is
not
in
the
european
union
s
best
interest
and
my
bet
is
he
ll
be
more
than
happy
to
tell
president
putin
that
straight
to
his
face
said
perry
five
western
firms
have
invested
in
