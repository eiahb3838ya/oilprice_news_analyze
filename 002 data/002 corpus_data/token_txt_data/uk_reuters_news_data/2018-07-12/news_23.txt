lagos
reuters
sixteen
years
after
emmanuel
ibeawuchi
lost
a
leg
in
a
road
accident
his
dream
of
playing
soccer
in
a
world
cup
is
about
to
become
a
reality
he
will
captain
nigeria
s
team
when
it
makes
its
debut
at
the
amputee
football
world
cup
in
mexico
in
october
the
team
hopes
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
nigeria
s
disabled
athletes
who
won
eight
gold
medals
at
the
paralympics
along
with
two
silver
and
two
bronze
medals
to
finish
in
the
medal
table
and
top
among
african
countries
we
are
the
best
all
over
the
world
so
whatever
we
do
we
excel
said
ibeawuchi
a
bus
conductor
citing
the
success
of
nigerian
disabled
athletes
across
a
range
of
sports
there
is
no
difference
between
one
leg
and
two
legs
in
terms
of
football
because
it
is
the
same
rules
added
the
who
has
played
the
game
since
his
lower
right
leg
was
amputated
a
few
inches
below
his
knee
the
amputee
tournament
will
take
place
just
months
after
the
world
cup
in
russia
where
nigeria
s
team
known
as
the
super
eagles
failed
to
qualify
from
the
group
stage
the
squad
has
been
training
in
the
commercial
capital
of
lagos
using
crutches
during
games
set
on
dusty
brown
soil
like
many
cities
across
africa
there
are
few
facilities
in
public
spaces
for
disabled
people
in
lagos
a
city
of
around
million
people
team
coach
victor
nwewe
said
this
makes
disabled
athletes
less
visible
a
factor
that
affects
the
confidence
of
some
players
we
have
put
it
in
them
that
they
should
see
themselves
as
equally
good
as
an
able
person
he
said
arguing
that
his
team
known
as
the
special
eagles
can
outperform
their
counterpart
s
appearance
at
the
world
cup
in
russia
since
then
all
of
them
have
the
confidence
now
that
they
can
even
do
better
than
the
able
bodied
