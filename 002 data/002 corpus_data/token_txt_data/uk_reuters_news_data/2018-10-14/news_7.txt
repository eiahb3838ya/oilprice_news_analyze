oct
reuters
amid
gathering
gloom
over
the
state
of
the
chinese
economy
exporters
of
motorcycles
tractors
photocopiers
and
christmas
tree
lighting
will
join
thousands
of
other
companies
peddling
their
wares
at
china
s
largest
trade
fair
monday
many
of
those
exporters
will
have
something
in
common
uncertainty
over
future
orders
as
a
trade
war
with
the
united
states
rages
the
turmoil
has
added
to
concerns
over
the
health
of
the
chinese
economy
already
under
pressure
from
a
cooling
property
market
a
crackdown
on
corporate
debt
and
risky
lending
practices
and
a
nationwide
campaign
the
united
states
over
the
summer
levied
tariffs
of
up
to
percent
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
as
punishment
for
what
it
says
are
unfair
trade
practices
by
china
the
latest
tariff
salvo
represented
half
of
the
billion
of
products
that
the
united
states
bought
from
china
last
year
the
rapid
escalation
of
the
trade
dispute
has
taken
many
chinese
exporters
by
surprise
at
the
spring
session
of
the
canton
fair
in
guangzhou
only
a
quarter
of
the
exporters
whom
reuters
spoke
to
said
they
expected
a
trade
war
as
exporters
gather
at
the
autumn
session
of
the
gathering
that
starts
monday
a
far
more
sombre
outlook
is
expected
to
pervade
the
tens
of
thousands
of
exhibition
booths
at
the
fair
president
donald
trump
has
repeatedly
threatened
to
slap
tariffs
on
more
chinese
imports
in
an
intensifying
trade
war
that
has
led
many
forecasters
including
the
international
monetary
fund
to
cut
their
global
economic
projections
for
and
beijing
has
been
urging
chinese
exporters
to
diversify
their
overseas
destinations
and
rely
less
on
the
united
states
china
s
biggest
trading
partner
or
turn
their
focus
to
domestic
customers
instead
our
existing
orders
are
relatively
stable
but
our
clients
are
not
increasing
their
orders
said
an
official
at
a
battery
maker
one
of
many
facing
higher
tariffs
on
chinese
batteries
we
re
keeping
prices
stable
and
swallowing
the
tariffs
ourselves
the
official
said
as
cities
and
provinces
like
guangdong
show
the
strain
policymakers
are
increasingly
rolling
out
measures
to
help
businesses
weather
the
trade
storm
the
central
bank
has
cut
the
amount
of
cash
that
commercial
banks
need
to
set
aside
as
reserves
four
times
this
year
to
spur
lending
to
small
businesses
the
finance
ministry
has
reduced
taxes
and
increased
tax
rebates
to
help
lower
the
overheads
of
businesses
infrastructure
projects
have
been
put
on
the
fast
track
to
stimulate
growth
the
authorities
while
saying
they
will
not
resort
to
competitive
devaluation
of
china
s
currency
to
boost
exports
have
allowed
the
yuan
to
fall
about
percent
against
the
dollar
this
year
overall
chinese
exports
have
been
mostly
resilient
with
data
friday
showing
that
september
shipments
soared
percent
far
exceeding
expectations
for
an
percent
uptick
the
trade
war
with
the
united
states
is
complicating
an
already
weakening
picture
of
growth
in
china
this
year
beijing
has
set
a
gdp
growth
target
of
around
percent
for
the
economy
expanded
percent
last
year
growth
has
been
slowing
as
china
sheds
excess
production
capacity
and
shuts
polluting
factories
with
fixed
asset
investment
slumping
this
year
and
monthly
industrial
output
growth
stuck
in
a
relatively
low
range
of
percent
meanwhile
curbs
and
restrictions
put
in
place
to
fend
off
property
speculators
have
resulted
in
a
slowdown
in
the
residential
real
estate
market
hitting
construction
and
other
related
sectors
the
impact
of
a
crackdown
on
corporate
debt
levels
and
risky
lending
practices
has
also
become
more
apparent
private
firms
are
warning
about
tighter
financing
as
their
access
to
shadow
financing
a
cheaper
source
of
funds
than
bank
loans
shrinks
annual
growth
in
outstanding
total
social
financing
a
broad
gauge
of
credit
that
includes
sheet
financing
slowed
to
percent
in
august
the
lowest
on
record
as
businesses
struggle
or
even
go
domestic
consumption
a
driver
of
the
economy
has
started
to
moderate
monthly
growth
in
retail
sales
one
gauge
of
china
s
consumption
dipped
below
percent
in
april
where
they
have
remained
since
the
last
time
retail
sales
grew
less
than
percent
was
over
a
decade
ago
automobile
sales
fell
for
the
third
straight
month
in
september
down
percent
from
a
year
earlier
as
worries
about
the
economy
prompted
consumers
to
tighten
their
and
forego
purchases
the
media
has
so
far
played
up
china
s
capability
to
tackle
both
internal
and
external
challenges
including
the
trade
war
saying
there
are
ample
policy
tools
available
to
keep
growth
on
an
even
footing
the
impact
of
the
trade
war
is
not
too
obvious
yet
because
the
tariffs
have
not
filtered
down
to
some
sectors
yet
said
joe
chung
owner
of
a
ceramic
tile
manufacturer
in
guangdong
the
worry
is
not
just
about
the
united
states
with
exports
to
the
slowing
there
will
be
increased
competition
for
other
overseas
markets
chung
said
predicting
tough
times
over
the
next
two
years
ceramic
floor
materials
are
on
the
tariff
chinese
exporters
of
goods
not
yet
on
any
tariff

products
like
toys
sewing
machines
and
