update 4-u.s. wants "regime change" in iran - rouhani
reuters
the
united
states
is
seeking
regime
change
in
iran
president
hassan
rouhani
said
on
sunday
adding
that
the
current
administration
is
the
most
hostile
that
the
islamic
republic
has
faced
in
its
four
decades
tensions
have
increased
between
iran
and
america
after
president
donald
trump
withdrew
from
a
agreement
on
iran
s
nuclear
programme
in
may
saying
it
was
flawed
because
it
did
not
include
curbs
on
iran
s
ballistic
missiles
programme
or
its
support
for
proxies
in
syria
yemen
lebanon
and
iraq
in
the
past
years
there
has
not
been
a
more
spiteful
team
than
the
current
government
team
towards
iran
iranians
and
the
islamic
republic
rouhani
said
in
a
speech
broadcast
on
state
tv
there
was
a
time
when
there
was
one
person
who
had
enmity
the
rest
were
moderate
now
the
worst
have
gathered
around
each
other
he
added
in
a
speech
marking
the
beginning
of
the
academic
year
at
tehran
university
in
washington
a
state
department
spokesman
repeated
its
position
that
it
wants
a
change
in
iran
s
behaviour
but
the
united
states
is
not
seeking
regime
he
said
trump
has
voiced
a
willingness
to
enter
into
talks
with
iran
and
wants
a
deal
that
also
covers
its
missile
programme
support
for
terrorism
and
malign
regional
our
hope
is
that
ultimately
the
regime
will
make
meaningful
changes
in
its
behaviour
he
added
rouhani
accused
the
americans
of
using
psychological
and
economic
warfare
and
questioning
the
legitimacy
of
the
islamic
republic
reducing
the
legitimacy
of
the
system
is
their
final
goal
when
they
say
getting
rid
of
regime
change
in
their
own
words
how
does
regime
change
happen
through
reducing
legitimacy
otherwise
a
regime
doesn
t
change
he
used
the
english
phrase
regime
change
to
emphasise
his
point
washington
reintroduced
steps
against
iran
s
currency
trade
metals
and
auto
sectors
in
august
with
curbs
on
iran
s
oil
exports
set
to
come
into
force
next
month
some
iranians
fear
their
country
is
entering
an
economic
slump
that
may
prove
worse
than
the
period
from
to
when
it
last
faced
major
sanctions
eshaq
jahangiri
played
down
the
impact
of
the
planned
restrictions
iran
has
been
able
to
find
new
partners
to
buy
its
oil
even
though
some
countries
have
stopped
purchases
jahangiri
said
on
sunday
according
to
islamic
republic
of
iran
broadcasting
irib
america
will
certainly
not
be
able
to
reduce
iran
s
oil
exports
to
zero
he
said
america
thinks
saudi
arabia
can
replace
this
oil
but
right
now
iran
s
oil
has
reached
more
than
and
with
half
the
previous
exports
we
will
have
the
same
income
as
before
