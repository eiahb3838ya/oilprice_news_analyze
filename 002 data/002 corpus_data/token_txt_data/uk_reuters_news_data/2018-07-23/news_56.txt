trump
on

lamented
the
recent

and
accused
the
european

and
china
of
manipulating
their

the

index
is
so
far
up

up
a

analysts

said
in

trump

also
playing
a

was
a

that
the

to

pared
some

on
the

the

and
the
dollar
s
weakness
together
added
to
the
yen
s
strength
which
was
last
up
percent
at
per
dollar
trade
tensions
remain
a
risk
but
with
an
extended
period
until
implementation
of
the
tariffs
and
the
next
round
of
escalation
apac
equities
are
unlikely
to
respond
much
to
trump
repeating
threats
already
known
jpmorgan
added
investors
are
now
looking
ahead
to
an
important
meeting
between
trump
and
european
commission
president
juncker
trade
tensions
are
likely
to
remain

of
the

to
be
showing
up

nonetheless
the

that
were
released
for

were
worse

in

expectations
of
a

increase
while

climbed
for
a
