u.s. republican unveils bill calling for carbon tax
washington
july
reuters
a
republican
lawmaker
in
the
house
of
representatives
unveiled
a
bill
calling
for
a
carbon
tax
on
monday
saying
he
hoped
the
legislation
would
at
the
very
least
renew
a
debate
on
climate
change
that
has
languished
for
a
decade
representative
carlos
curbelo
a
member
of
the
house
tax
committee
who
faces
a
tough
bid
in
florida
said
the
legislation
called
the
market
choice
act
enjoys
small
but
growing
support
among
republicans
who
in
recent
years
have
been
better
known
for
rejection
of
carbon
tax
proposals
the
measure
is
sure
to
fail
but
curbelo
speaking
at
a
washington
forum
on
monday
remained
upbeat
i
truly
believe
that
one
day
this
bill
or
legislation
similar
to
it
will
become
law
curbelo
said
it
will
spark
an
important
debate
about
investing
in
our
country
s
infrastructure
the
way
we
tax
and
what
to
do
to
protect
the
environment
he
said
curbelo
said
his
legislation
would
exceed
the
carbon
reduction
goals
of
the
paris
climate
change
pact
by
imposing
a
levy
on
industrial
emissions
which
would
begin
in
and
rise
annually
it
would
replace
existing
taxes
on
gasoline
and
aviation
fuel
he
said
the
tax
would
generate
billion
in
revenue
over
a
decade
for
infrastructure
investments
the
bill
would
also
impose
a
moratorium
on
regulations
governing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
the
legislation
represents
a
small
but
meaningful
shift
for
republicans
on
climate
politics
driven
in
part
by
candidates
in
swing
states
where
increasingly
frequent
hurricanes
and
floods
make
no
distinction
between
republicans
and
democrats
many
republicans
supported
a
climate
bill
years
ago
but
it
died
in
the
senate
since
then
republicans
including
president
donald
trump
have
largely
stood
firm
on
two
positions
cutting
taxes
and
opposing
climate
legislation
last
week
the
house
voted
to
approve
a
resolution
expressing
the
sense
of
congress
that
a
carbon
tax
would
be
detrimental
to
the
united
states
curbelo
opposed
the
measure
along
with
five
other
republicans
a
seventh
chose
not
to
support
the
resolution
by
voting
curbelo
intends
to
discuss
his
bill
with
the
bipartisan
house
climate
solutions
caucus
which
includes
other
republicans
we
re
seeing
trends
in
the
house
that
should
give
us
hope
said
curbelo
the
bill
would
be
introduced
formally
later
on
monday
