criticised

trump
on
friday
lamented
the
recent
strength
of
the

and
accused
the
european

of
manipulating

it
does
feel
like
we
are
hearing
far
too
much
from
the
president
s
twitter
account
at
the
moment
and
the
market
is
not
receiving
many
of
his
comments
well
said
nick
twidale
analyst
at
rakuten
securities
australia
but
investors
are
quite
rightly
positioning
themselves
accordingly
he
added
the
threat
that
policies
pose
to
global
growth
is
considerable
and
the
market
will
continue
to
react
to
presidential
tweets
and
comments

the

weakness
together
added

the

the

went
as

on

the

two

at
analysts
at
jpmorgan
said
these
moves
together
with
a
lower
greenback
and
better
commodity
prices
should
be
positive
for
asian
equities
indeed
chinese

hong

were
in
positive
territory
on
monday
after
a
subdued
start
the

while
the

was
a

firmer
trade

remain
a
risk
but
with
an
extended
period
until
implementation
of

the
next

apac

are
unlikely
to
respond

jpmorgan
added
investors
are
now
looking
ahead
to
an
important
meeting
between
trump
and
european
commission
president
juncker
in
the
white
house
where
they
will
discuss
potential

on

in

it
s
probably
a
little
too
early
for
the
indirect
impact
of
the
trade
issue
to
be
showing
up
in
the

nonetheless
the

worse
