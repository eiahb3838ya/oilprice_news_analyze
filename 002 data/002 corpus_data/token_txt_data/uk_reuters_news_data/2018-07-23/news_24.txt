reports
bond
yields
climbed
as
the
federal
reserve
was
seen
as
likely
to
continue
raising
interest
rates
despite
criticism
from
president
donald
trump
and
after
a
reuters
report
that
the
bank
of
japan
boj
was
discussing
modifying
its
huge
stimulus
program
sent
japan
s
bond
yield
to
a
high
the
report
rekindled
anxieties
about
how
much
monetary
policymakers
will
continue
supporting
economies
around
the
world
and
piled
further
pressure
on

already
struggling
to
navigate
rising
protectionism
treasury

hit
their
highest
in
a

and
traded

it
s
all
that
concern
investors
have
about
the
move
from
global
quantitative
easing
to

index
rose
percent
off

it
hit
after
trump
criticized
the
federal

s
rate
hikes
and
accused
the
european
union
and
china
of
manipulating
their
currencies
beijing
said
it
has
no
intention
of
devaluing
the

to

we
see
the
latest
news
on
trade
policy
as
pointing
to
continued
high
risk
of
escalation
between
the

china

a
renewed

driven
by
more

growth
expectations
a
shrinking
gap
between

this
year
has
been
seen
as
a
possible
sign
of
a
coming
recession
