the

ntpc
is
the
country
s
top
power
producer
and
accidents
have
been
rare
at
its
facilities
the
plant
operators
were
aware
of
an
ash
buildup
in
the
boiler
and
had
reduced
the
unit
s
load
to
mw
while
workers
cleared
the
ash
from
the
furnace
bottom
in
the
hours
leading
up
the
accident
the
report
said
the
ash
buildup
however
caused
a
boiler
tube
carrying
steam
to
leak
leading
to
a
high
pressure
buildup
and
subsequent
burning
of
flammable
substances
the
report
said
that
led
to
a
build
up
of
steam
pressure
in
the
unit
that
caused
it
to
trip
or
involuntarily
shut
down
following
which
hot
ash
and
gases
were
released
at
high
speeds
that
killed
and

the
workers

to

a
spokesman
for
bharat
heavy
electricals
ltd
which
made
the
boiler
tubes
at

did
not
respond
to
repeated
calls
and
emails
two
ntpc
officials
who
did
not
want
to
be
named
citing
government
policy
said
the
company
did
not
have
the
equipment
to
measure
the
amount
of
ash
buildup
in
its
plants
and
relied
on
physical
inspection
ntpc
has
now
begun
talks
with

to
install
