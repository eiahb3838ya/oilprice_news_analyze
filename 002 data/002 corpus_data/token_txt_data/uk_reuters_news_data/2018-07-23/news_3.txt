south
africa
s
struggling
power
firm
eskom
said
on
monday
it
was
considering
cutting
staff
and
selling
assets
after
reporting
a
million
loss
which
underlined
the
gravity
of
its
financial
position
eskom
africa
s
largest
public
utility
was
embroiled
in
corruption
scandals
under
former
president
jacob
zuma
and
narrowly
avoided
a
liquidity
crunch
early
this
year
after
banks
halted
lending
zuma
has
denied
wrongdoing
the
company
is
critical
to
south
africa
it
supplies
more
than
percent
of
the
country
s
power
has
around
billion
rand
billion
of
debt
and
is
often
cited
as
a
threat
to
south
africa
s
credit
ratings
which
hover
on
the
edge
of
junk
status
eskom
has
also
become
one
of
the
most
visible
examples
of
the
effects
of
corruption
at
companies
in
south
africa
as
a
pay
dispute
with
unions
triggered
protests
leading
to
a
spate
of
rolling
blackouts
last
month
new
president
cyril
ramaphosa
replaced
eskom
s
entire
board
and
top
executives
in
january
in
one
of
his
first
interventions
since
becoming
leader
of
the
ruling
african
national
congress
anc
eskom
is
undoubtedly
facing
one
of
the
most
difficult
times
in
its
history
eskom
chairman
jabu
mabuza
told
reporters
we
are
not
able
to
tell
you
today
that
all
the
skeletons
are
eskom
blamed
the
billion
rand
loss
for
the
financial
year
which
ended
in
march
on
increases
in
financing
costs
and
depreciation
of
assets
like
kusile
and
medupi
two
massive
power
stations
which
have
suffered
significant
delays
and
cost
overruns
it
also
reported
billion
rand
of
irregular
expenditure
and
said
it
had
billion
rand
of
cash
at
the
end
of
march
down
from
billion
a
year
earlier
eskom
s
new
management
is
combing
its
finances
from
late
in
an
effort
to
recover
money
lost
through
corruption
it
has
asked
for
criminal
cases
to
be
opened
against
some
former
employees
and
suppliers
chief
executive
phakamani
hadebe
said
eskom
had
started
discussions
with
the
government
about
getting
its
staff
numbers
right
a
veiled
reference
that
the
firm
is
considering
cuts
to
its
bloated
workforce
analysts
have
long
called
for
eskom
to
take
action
to
reduce
ballooning
staff
costs
and
eskom
chairman
mabuza
said
on
monday
the
company
believed
it
had
around
too
many
employees
for
a
graphic
of
eskom
financial
woes
eskom
executives
also
said
they
were
looking
at
whether
to
sell
assets
to
shore
up
the
firm
s
balance
sheet
anc
sources
told
reuters
this
month
that
ramaphosa
had
secured
the
backing
of
senior
figures
in
the
ruling
party
for
steps
to
boost
private
investment
in
the
power
supply
industry
including
by
selling
off
parts
of
eskom
s
business
eskom
has
already
announced
plans
to
sell
a
mortgage
lender
it
owns
we
are
busy
with
the
process
of
optimising
our
balance
sheet
chief
financial
officer
calib
cassim
said
warning
that
high
financing
costs
would
continue
to
drag
on
eskom
s
bottom
line
in
the
financial
year
cassim
added
we
are
leaving
all
our
options
