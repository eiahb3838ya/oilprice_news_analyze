saudi
electricity
is
in
the
process
of
getting
other
companies
involved
in
bidding
for
power
plant
services
rather
than
relying
on
ge
as
the
sole
provider
because
qualifying
competitors
will
lower
prices
the
source
said
saudi

previously
created
competition
for

s
service
history
in

arabia
said
some
turbines
that
saudi
electricity
purchased
more
recently
may
not
be
under
agreements
because
the
service
price
was
high

those
could
be
opened
for
bidding
at
any
time
one
side
effect
of
saudi
electricity
qualifying
firms
to
repair
its
is
that
it
is
large
enough
to
enable
competitors
to
set
up
operations
that
they
could
use
to
sell
the
parts
and
repair
services
to
customers
outside
saudi
arabia
potentially
threatening
portions
of
ge
s
service
business
globally
three
sources
said
saudi
electricity
