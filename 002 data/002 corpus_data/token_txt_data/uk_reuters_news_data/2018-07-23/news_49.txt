private
oil
refiner
and
an
agricultural
processor
in
china

shandong
province
have

as
tightening
credit
and
weakening

conditions
exact
a
toll
on
one
of
china
s
industrial
engines
while
the
companies
are
relatively
small

according
to

the

in
the

province
of

the

were
made
in
a

in

in

on

according
to
filings
posted
on
a
website
run
by

on

few
other
details
were
available
about
the
cause
of
the
companies
problems
the
companies
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
but
their
financial
plight
underscores
deepening
financial
pain
among
small
teapot
refiners
and
crushers
alike
many
operators
in
both
sectors
are
losing
cash
as
a
domestic
glut
of
product
hurts
margins
it
also
highlights
concerns
about
growing
debt
and
tightening
credit
for
small
businesses
as
beijing
seeks
to
crack
down
on
financial
risks
across
its
economy

shandong

zhongyi
china
richest
man
according
to
forbes
rich
list
and
his
brother
accounted
for
an
estimated
percent
of
china
soybean
imports
in
although
it
has
shrunk
in
size
in
recent
years
according
to
traders
its
financial
problems
are
due
to
falling
demand
for
animal
feed
after
pig
farmers
in
china
the
world
s
biggest
pork
consumer
began
culling
their
herds
because
of
declining
meat
prices
crushing
companies
reduce
soybean
seeds
to
both
oil
and
meal
crushers
in
shandong
are
losing
almost
yuan
per
ton
of
soybeans
they
process
according
to
shanghai
jc
intelligence
china
s
vast
farm
sector
is
also
facing
uncertainty
as
washington
s
trade
dispute
with
beijing
threatens
to
curb
supplies
of
critical
farm
goods
including
soybeans
and
inflate
costs
haiyou
is
the
first
bankruptcy
by
a
teapot
refinery
since
china
liberalized
oil
imports
in
to
increase
competition
in
a
sector
dominated
by
giants
many
of
china
s
independent
refiners
which
buy
a
fifth
of
imported
crude
are
losing
cash
due
to
the
resurgent
oil
price
tough
new
taxes
and
shrinking
diesel
demand
it
s
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
said
harry
liu
oil
consultant
with
ihs
markit
we
may
see
more
smaller
plants
especially
those
without
import
quotas
fold
as
their
margins
are
squeezed
he
said
that
the
change
was
a
sign
that
a
tax
policy
begun
by
beijing
in
march
was
having
a
bigger
blow
on
some
of
the
teapots
than
we
expected
beijing
enacted
new
rules
in
march
to
enforce
collection
of
a
per
barrel
gasoline
consumption
tax
and
a
per
barrel
tax
on
diesel
a
response
to
the
alleged
use
of
illicit
fuel
invoices
by
many
of
the
teapots
to
evade
the
taxes
