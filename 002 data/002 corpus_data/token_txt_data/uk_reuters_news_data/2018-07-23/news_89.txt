the
rising
value
of
the
dollar
against
most
other
major
currencies
is
creating
an
additional
headwind
for
oil
prices
as
it
pushes
up
the
local
price
of
crude
and
fuels
across
much
of
asia
europe
and
latin
america
in
terms
the
dollar
has
risen
to
its
highest
since
late
and
early
and
before
that
adjusted
for
inflation
the
dollar
s
value
is
close
to
its
highest
since
according
to
the
broad
exchange
rate
index
compiled
by
the
federal
reserve
the
dollar
has
appreciated
by
more
than
percent
against
china
s
yuan
since
the
end
of
march
in
response
to
the
worsening
trade
tensions
between
the
two
countries
china
overtook
the
united
states
to
become
the
world
s
largest
crude
importer
in
and
net
imports
of
crude
and
fuels
are
now
running
at
around
million
barrels
per
day
brent
crude
prices
have
risen
nearly
percent
this
year
in
dollar
terms
but
are
up
more
than
percent
in
yuan
as
a
result
of
the
shift
china
s
currency
depreciation
is
partly
driven
by
bilateral
tensions
as
the
country
s
authorities
actively
engineer
or
passively
permit
the
exchange
rate
to
act
as
a
shock
absorber
the
practical
effect
is
the
same
but
the
dollar
has
also
appreciated
against
every
other
major
currency
including
the
euro
the
japanese
yen
the
british
pound
the
south
korean
won
and
the
canadian
dollar
the
currency
is
also
rising
against
most
currencies
including
the
brazilian
real
the
indian
rupee
and
the
indonesian
rupiah
in
general
it
is
the
dollar
appreciating
rather
than
other
currencies
depreciating
mostly
as
a
result
of
strong
economic
growth
in
the
united
states
steadily
rising
interest
rates
and
capital
flows
the
result
is
that
oil
prices
in
most
countries
are
now
rising
much
faster
than
the
international
benchmark
prices
quoted
in
dollars
there
is
no
simple
and
stable
relationship
between
exchange
rates
and
oil
prices
quoted
in
dollars
the
two
have
sometimes
been
correlated
and
sometimes
not
exchange
rates
are
only
one
of
many
influences
on
the
price
of
oil
and
the
relationship
is
not
strong
or
predictable
enough
to
be
tradeable
but
a
strong
dollar
is
generally
associated
with
lower
benchmark
oil
prices
and
vice
versa
all
other
things
being
equal
the
last
period
of
very
high
oil
prices
between
and
the
first
half
of
coincided
with
a
period
of
dollar
weakness
which
cushioned
the
impact
in
many
major
countries
but
oil
s
recent
rise
has
been
accompanied
by
a
strengthening
dollar
especially
in
recent
months
which
will
intensify
the
impact
on
consumers
many
emerging
markets
also
took
advantage
of
low
oil
prices
in
and
to
scale
back
fuel
subsidies
and
price
controls
consumers
in
many
of
the
fuel
markets
are
being
exposed
to
the
impact
of
pricier
oil
much
more
than
before
gasoline
and
diesel
prices
in
india
for
example
one
of
the
fuel
markets
recently
hit
record
levels
because
of
a
cocktail
of
higher
crude
prices
a
stronger
dollar
fiscal
changes
and
the
reduction
of
price
controls
if
the
dollar
continues
to
strengthen
rising
oil
prices
are
likely
to
prompt
a
much
larger
from
consumers
than
in
in
the
current
cycle
demand
restraint
is
likely
to
be
felt
much
faster
and
more
aggressively
than
in
or
so
long
as
the
dollar
remains
