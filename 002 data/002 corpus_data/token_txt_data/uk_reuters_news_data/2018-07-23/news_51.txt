reuters
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
launched
a
rhetorical
assault
on
iran
s
leaders
on
sunday
comparing
them
to
a
mafia
and
promising
unspecified
backing
for
iranians
unhappy
with
their
government
pompeo
in
a
california
speech
to
a
largely
audience
dismissed
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
and
foreign
minister
javad
zarif
who
negotiated
a
nuclear
deal
with
the
united
states
and
five
other
countries
as
merely
polished
front
men
for
the
ayatollahs
international
con
president
donald
trump
withdrew
in
may
from
the
nuclear
accord
designed
to
stop
iran
from
developing
nuclear
weapons
tehran
has
said
its
nuclear
work
is
just
for
electricity
generation
and
other
peaceful
projects
iran
is
run
by
something
that
resembles
the
mafia
more
than
a
government
pompeo
said
citing
what
he
called
iranian
leaders
vast
wealth
and
corruption
pompeo
s
speech
was
the
latest
step
in
a
communications
offensive
launched
by
the
trump
administration
that
is
meant
to
foment
unrest
in
iran
and
help
pressure
its
government
to
end
its
nuclear
programme
and
support
of
militant
groups
officials
familiar
with
the
matter
said
the
offensive
is
meant
to
work
in
concert
with
severe
economic
sanctions
that
washington
plans
to
reimpose
in
the
coming
months
including
on
tehran
s
oil
exports
its
principal
revenue
generator
the
united
states
will
work
with
countries
that
import
iranian
oil
to
get
imports
as
close
to
zero
as
possible
by
pompeo
said
rouhani
cautioned
trump
on
sunday
about
pursuing
hostile
policies
against
tehran
saying
war
with
iran
is
the
mother
of
all
but
he
did
not
rule
out
peace
between
the
two
countries
which
have
been
at
odds
since
the
islamic
revolution
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
incite
the
iranian
nation
against
iran
s
security
and
interests
rouhani
said
in
an
apparent
reference
to
reports
of
efforts
by
washington
to
destabilise
iran
s
islamic
government
trump
responded
to
rouhani
in
a
tweet
late
on
sunday
saying
never
ever
threaten
the
united
states
again
or
you
will
suffer
consequences
the
likes
of
which
few
throughout
history
have
ever
suffered
before
we
are
no
longer
a
country
that
will
stand
for
your
demented
words
of
violence
death
be
cautious
voice
of
people
publicly
the
trump
administration
says
its
policy
with
iran
is
not
regime
change
but
to
change
tehran
s
behaviour
so
it
stops
nuclear
and
missile
work
support
for
proxies
in
the
middle
east
and
backing
of
militant
groups
while
it
is
ultimately
up
to
the
iranian
people
to
determine
the
direction
of
their
country
the
united
states
will
support
the
voice
of
the
iranian
people
pompeo
said
pompeo
spoke
at
the
ronald
reagan
presidential
library
in
simi
valley
california
to
a
packed
house
of
about
people
he
received
frequent
applause
although
one
audience
member
heckled
him
over
the
trump
administration
s
immigration
policies
several
dozen
protesters
lined
the
route
to
the
site
including
one
group
that
distributed
fliers
opposing
both
iran
s
current
government
and
any
intervention
in
iran
pompeo
said
senior
iranian
leaders
had
benefited
from
embezzlement
sweetheart
deals
and
other
gains
iran
s
ayatollahs
he
said
were
hypocritical
holy
men
who
seem
more
concerned
with
riches
than
pompeo
said
the
government
broadcasting
agency
was
launching
a
channel
on
tv
radio
digital
and
social
media
platforms
the
government
also
is
taking
steps
to
help
iranians
get
around
internet
censorship
