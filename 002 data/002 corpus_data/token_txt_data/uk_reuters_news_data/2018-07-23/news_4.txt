sent
tremors
through

markets
on

while

bond
yields
climbed
after
a
reuters
report
that
the
boj
was
discussing
modifying
its
huge
stimulus
program
sent
japan
s
bond
yield
to
a
high
the
report
rekindled
anxieties
about
monetary
stimulus
easing
around
the
world
and
piled
further
pressure
on
investors
already
struggling
to
navigate
rising
protectionism
the
yield
on
europe
s
benchmark
bond
the
german
bund
hit
a
high
of

treasury
yields
also
hit
their
highest
in
a
month
at
percent
the
japanese
yen
climbed
percent
to
highs
against
the
greenback
at
per
dollar
it
s
all
that
concern
investors
have
about
the
move
from
global
quantitative
easing
to
global
quantitative
tightening
that
fear
gets
stoked
when
you
have
reports
such
as
this
said
rory

psigma
investment
management
s
head
of
investment
strategy
the
dollar
index
rose
a
bit
off
lows
it
hit
after
president
trump
criticized
the
federal
reserve
s
rate
hikes
and
accused
the
european
union
and
china
of
manipulating
their
currencies
beijing
said
it
has
no
intention
of
devaluing
the
yuan
to
help
exports
we
see
the
latest
news
on
trade
policy
as
pointing
to
continued
high
risk
of
escalation
between
the
and
china
and
a
renewed
focus
of
the
trump
administration
on
currency
matters
goldman
sachs
analysts
said
trump
s
warnings
about
excessive
interest
rate
hikes
also
helped
the
gap
between
short

treasury
yields
widen
that
steepening
of
the
yield
curve
continued
on
monday
with
yields
on
treasuries
more
than
percentage
points
higher
than
their
counterparts
the
biggest
gap
in
nearly
a
month
yields
are
influenced
by
monetary
policy
and
government
bonds
are
driven
by
more
by
inflation
and
growth
expectations
the
yield
curve
s
flattening
or
the
shrinking
gap
between
short
and
long
yields
has
been
seen
as
a
possible
sign
of
an
coming
recession
the
president
s
new
threats
to
slap
duties
on
all
billion
of
imports
from
china
