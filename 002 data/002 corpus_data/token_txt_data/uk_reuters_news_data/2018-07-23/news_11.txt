signs

might

its

on

while

appetite
europe
s
bond
yields
climbed
after
a
reuters
report
that
the
boj
was
discussing
modifying
its
huge
easing
programme
sent
japan
s
bond
yield
to
a
high
the
report
rekindled
anxieties
about
monetary
stimulus
easing
around
the
world
and
piled
further
pressure
on
investors
already
struggling
to
navigate
rising
protectionism
the
yield
on
europe
s
benchmark
bond
the
german
bund
hit
a
high
of
percent
and
treasury
yields
also
hit
their
highest
in
a
month
at
percent
the
yen
climbed
to
highs
against
the
dollar
and
was
last
up
percent
at
per
dollar
it
s
all
that
concern
investors
have
about
the
move
from
global
quantitative
easing
to
global
quantitative
tightening
that
fear
gets
stoked
when
you
have
reports
such
as
this
psigma
investment
management
s
head
of
investment
strategy
rory
mcpherson
said
the
ecb
meeting
this
week
will
be
more
in
focus
now
that
we
ve
had
this
concern
about
the
dollar
index
languished
near
the
low
it
hit
after
president
trump
criticised
the
federal
reserve
s
tightening
policy
and
accused
the
european
union
and
china
of
manipulating
their
currencies
beijing
said
it
has
no
intention
of
devaluing
the
yuan
to
help
exports
we
see
the
latest
news
on
trade
policy
as
pointing
to
continued
high
risk
of
escalation
between
the
and
china
and
a
renewed
focus
of
the
trump
administration
on
currency
matters
goldman
sachs
analysts
said
trump
s
comments
about
rates
also
helped
the
treasury
yield
curve
reach
its
steepest
in
three
weeks
the
yield
curve
s
flattening
has
been
seen
by
some
as
a
sign
of
an
impending
recession
the
president
s
new
threats
to
slap
duties
on
all
billion
of
imports
from
china
triggered
across
stock
markets
though
good
earnings
kept
a
lid
on
losses
s
p
and
dow
jones
benchmark
futures
were
flat
while
futures
for
the
nasdaq
fell
percent
by
gmt
indicating
a
tepid
start
for
wall
street
europe
s
stoxx
fell
percent
by
gmt
as
investors
braced
for
a
packed
earnings
week
and
a
meeting
between
european
commission
president
juncker
and
trump
to
discuss
threatened
tariffs
which
may
affect
carmakers
the
pattern
of
trump
s
meetings
has
generally
been
more
conciliatory
when
he
meets
in
person
it
could
actually
be
good
for
autos
psigma
s
mcpherson
said
europe
s
autos
sector
was
down
percent
hitting
a
week
low
the
index
is
down
percent
this
year
and
is
among
the
european
sectors
goldman
sachs
analysts
said
auto
tariffs
if
they
came
to
pass
were
likely
to
cause
weakness
in
the
canadian
dollar
and
mexican
peso
possibly
also
affecting
the
euro
pound
yen
and
korean
won
as
investors
priced
in
a
hit
to
the
economy
the
global
economy
is
still
okay
but
the
risk
is
now
very
high
and
if
trade
policies
don
t
make
a
very
soon
we
ll
see
a
measurable
impact
on
growth
already
next
year
unicredit

erik
nielsen
said
concerns
about
growth
affecting
demand
for
fuel
had
dented
crude
prices
in
early
trading
but
oil
rose
again
as

worsened
between
iran
and

a
