heavyweights
kansai
electric
power
and
osaka
gas
are
locked
in
a
struggle
for
dominance
in
the
kansai
region
whose
economy
is
nearly
the
size
of
south
korea
s
and
includes
osaka
the
city
in
japan
after
the
fukushima
nuclear
disaster
the
country
s
power
monopoly
system
in
place
for
nearly
years
was
partially
dismantled
in
followed
by
the
liberalisation
of
the
retail
gas
market
a
year
later
hundreds
of
new
power
sellers
soon
arrived
on
the
scene
some
with
just
a
few
dozen
accounts
since
then
the
kansai
region
has
seen
the
most
gas
customers
and
the
number
of
power
customers
switch
providers
nowhere
is
that
churn
more
evident
than
with
kansai
electric
and
osaka
gas
kansai
electric
pulled
about
retail
gas
customers
from
osaka
gas
but
lost
about
power
customers
to
it
overall
kansai
electric
lost
nearly
million
power
users
but
its
shares
have
risen
percent
since
the
beginning
of
compared
with
about
percent
decline
for
osaka
gas
it
s
like
the
elephants
battling
horses
when
power
and
gas
firms
battle
it
out
against
tokyo
electric
tepco
or
kansai
electric
for
an
extended
period
gas
firms
could
lose
said
reiji
ogino
senior
analyst
at
mitsubishi
ufj
morgan
stanley
securities
he
said
kansai
electric
is
predicted
to
shed
to
percent
of
its
customers
in
coming
years
osaka
gas
however
is
expected
to
see
its
customer
base
shrink
by
to
percent
he
added
that
is
because
power
companies
which
tend
to
be
larger
and
more
diverse
can
better
weather
deregulation
ogino
said
kansai
electric
for
instance
now
sells
gas
to
retail
customers
and
the
company
already
the
power
supplier
in
japan
has
an
additional
advantage
in
the
past
months
it
has
resumed
operations
at
four
reactors
idled
after
the
fukushima
disaster
that
has
allowed
it
to
cut
its
electricity
prices
by
percent
in
july
making
them
the
among
the
former
power
monopolies
a
price
war
is
especially
beneficial
for
large
users
such
as
japan
which
has
switched
its
thousands
of
convenience
stores
to
kansai
electric
the
savings
could
amount
to
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
per
year
according
to
local
media
reports
osaka
gas
which
has
gigawatts
of
domestic
power
plant
capacity
mostly
fired
by
gas
reacted
by
undercutting
kansai
electric
s
prices
but
kansai
electric
still
offers
cheaper
combined
power
and
gas
service
than
osaka
gas
this
year
it
also
began
offering
additional
discounts
such
as
waiving
basic
monthly
fees
for
gas
which
have
accelerated
the
pace
of
customer
acquisitions
from
its
chief
rival
ogino
said
that
the
power
and
gas
industries
in
japan
are
likely
to
enter
a
period
of
alliances
of
former
power
and
gas
monopolies
in
different
regions
by
the
years
after
that
might
see
mergers
and
acquisitions
he
added
but
he
said
a
merger
of
the
two
rivals
would
be
unlikely
i
don
t
think
the
trade
ministry
would
allow
the
creation
of
one
giant
power
and
gas
company
in
the
kansai
region
because
the
competition
principle
does
not
work
ogino
said
shinichi
yamazaki
senior
sector
analyst
at
okasan
securities
agreed
chances
for
acquisitions
or
mergers
in
kansai
region
may
be
slim
because
the
companies
are
large
in
size
but
there
may
be
such
cases
in
remote
areas
yamazaki
said
kansai
electric
has
tried
to
strengthen
its
position
further
by
buying
stakes
in
lng
projects
outside
japan
getting
into
retail
gas
sales
and
even
delving
into
real
estate
the
history
of
their
battle
goes
back
two
or
three
decades
but
given
osaka
gas
thinks
it
s
no
match
for
kansai
electric
it
has
been
diversifying
its
businesses
from
way
back
he
said
history
repeats
itself
and
the
battle
