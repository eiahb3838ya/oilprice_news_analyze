tour
guide
wayan
aksara
noticed
that
more
and
more
visitors
he
showed
around
the
indonesian
island
of
bali
were
complaining
about
garbage
on
its
beaches
bali
s
mounting
rubbish
problem
was
also
becoming
personal
for
aksara
who
lives
near
saba
beach
an
undeveloped
area
close
to
the
holiday
resort
of
sanur
which
faces
a
constant
battle
with
trash
washed
onto
its
shores
from
a
nearby
river
every
time
we
drove
around
our
guests
would
comment
about
it
not
being
clean
and
the
large
amount
of
plastic
said
aksara
they
would
say
the
trash
is
bad
that
tourism
here
is
not
sustainable
and
ask
what
we
are
doing
about
aksara
joined
and
is
now
chairman
of
trash
hero
indonesia
a
community
group
with
more
than
chapters
across
indonesia
and
about
on
bali
it
uses
social
media
to
organise
weekly
events
for
volunteers
aksara
a
also
gives
talks
at
schools
and
community
events
on
how
to
manage
waste
better
like
many
parts
of
asia
the
indonesian
archipelago
of
more
than
islands
has
a
economy
and
population
and
a
huge
coastline
with
many
densely
populated
cities
these
factors
have
created
a
perfect
storm
for
garbage
in
the
surrounding
seas
said
susan
ruffo
a
managing
director
at
the
group
ocean
conservancy
garbage
collection
services
and
infrastructure
have
largely
failed
to
keep
pace
with
rapid
development
now
as
awareness
rises
civil
society
groups
like
trash
hero
are
playing
an
important
role
in
bali
s
push
to
keep
its
famous
beaches
and
temples
free
of
rubbish
on
saba
beach
surrounded
by
coconut
trees
and
grazing
cows
the
garbage
strewn
about
includes
toothpaste
tubes
shoes
plastic
bottles
nappies
drinking
straws
and
cigarette
packets
there
is
a
plastic
problem
in
bali
we
need
time
but
we
have
started
already
aksara
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
big
things
start
from
small
globally
more
than
million
tonnes
of
plastics
are
dumped
into
the
ocean
each
year
scientists
say
about
one
truckload
per
minute
china
indonesia
vietnam
the
philippines
and
thailand
are
the
top
five
culprits
said
ocean
conservancy
s
ruffo
aside
from
the
impacts
on
human
health
and
wildlife
economic
cooperation
a
forum
has
put
the
cost
to
the
region
s
tourism
fishing
and
shipping
industries
at
about
billion
per
year
stung
by
criticism
indonesia
s
president
joko
widodo
who
has
targeted
new
balis
across
the
archipelago
to
boost
tourism
has
been
quick
to
act
last
year
luhut
binsar
pandjaitan
indonesia
s
coordinating
minister
for
maritime
affairs
launched
a
national
action
plan
pledging
up
to
billion
to
cut
ocean
waste
percent
by
in
june
local
media
reported
the
government
had
teamed
up
with
muslim
clerics
to
tell
their
more
than
million
followers
to
choose
reusable
bags
over
plastic
ones
jenna
jambeck
a
university
of
georgia
professor
who
specialises
in
plastic
waste
and
marine
debris
said
indonesia
had
become
a
leader
on
the
issue
out
of
a
desire
to
protect
their
amazing
resources
and
beautiful
country
bali
s
most
popular
tourist
beaches
are
now
cleaned
of
trash
at
least
once
a
day
by
local
authorities
using
heavy
machinery
mass
are
organised
at
least
three
times
a
year
on
bali
and
across
indonesia
bringing
together
tens
of
thousands
of
tourists
and
locals
to
tidy
up
communities
despite
this
the
rubbish
problem
on
bali
was
so
bad
late
last
year
that
officials
declared
a
garbage
emergency
if
you
re
finding
plastic
on
the
beach
it
s
already
too
late
said
ocean
conservancy
s
ruffo
it
should
never
be
there
in
the
first
place
how
do
you
stop
it
at
source
there
is
no
one
fix
or
silver
tracing
the
origins
of
the
trash
on
bali
s
beaches
is
difficult
but
experts
estimate
up
to
percent
comes
from
the
island
itself
rubbish
collected
from
hotels
and
villages
by
informal
workers
is
often
dumped
in
rivers
and
then
carried
out
to
sea
before
eventually
finding
its
way
back
to
the
coastline
a
rise
in
the
use
of
plastic
packaging
over
the
last
decade
coupled
with
increased
wealth
and
consumption
has
exacerbated
the
problem
experts
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
bali
desperately
needs
to
improve
its
landfill
sites
invest
in
more
recycling
facilities
carry
out
regular
trash
collections
and
expand
its
piped
water
supply
they
added
businesses
meanwhile
should
redesign
products
or
change
materials
so
they
are
easier
to
reuse
or
recycle
said
jambeck
governments
also
can
make
a
difference
by
requiring
a
certain
amount
of
recycled
content
in
products
banning
plastic
bags
or
taxing
plastics
she
added
based
in
bali
s
cultural
centre
of
ubud
local
company
rumah
kompos
has
six
trucks
that
collect
waste
from
hotels
and
private
homes
the
trash
is
then
separated
at
the
company
s
depot
to
recycle
turn
into
compost
or
send
to
landfill
a
new
recycling
facility
funded
by
the
government
will
boost
rumah
kompos
capacity
later
this
year
said
manager
supardi
asmorobangun
the
facility
will
host
local
children
at
weekend
green
camps
with
a
cinema
showing
films
on
climate
change
and
plastic
waste
he
said
the
company
has
also
begun
piloting
a
free
reusable
water
bottle
scheme
at
schools
in
ubud
my
dream
for
the
next
five
years
is
for
every
village
on
bali
to
do
rubbish
separation
asmorobangun
said
we
must
do
it
now
not
new
technologies
and
asia
s
army
of
informal
rubbish
collectors
and
scavengers
are
also
key
tools
experts
said
at
sanur
kaja
village
in
denpasar
garbage
gatherers
are
reaping
the
financial
rewards
of
joining
a
pilot
project
run
by
gringgo
trash
tech
reflected
in
a
row
of
brand
new
motorcycles
parked
near
the
local
authority
s
waste
collection
facility
the
company
mapped
out
denpasar
and
began
a
project
last
year
using
existing
waste
infrastructure
to
improve
recycling
and
collection
apps
and
gps
helped
create
a
zoning
system
in
the
village
of
residents
enabling
garbage
gatherers
to
become
and
more
efficient
as
a
result
they
can
collect
more
rubbish
from
more
households
to
increase
their
earnings
if
these
guys
stop
working
this
city
will
be
shut
down
in
less
than
a
week
said
gringgo
olivier
pouillon
besides
improving
coordination
with
the
local
authority
gringgo
s
app
provides
the
latest
prices
for
recyclable
waste
the
system
now
serves
about
percent
of
the
village
with
three
times
as
much
rubbish
collected
said
pouillon
the
quickest
way
to
stop
the
pollution
is
to
track
where
the
waste
is
going
and
that
exactly
what
we
done
