the

opened
fire
at
the
militants
hand
grenades
were
hurled
at
security
forces
we
believe
that
the

are

the
tactics
they
used

main

used
pistols

shoot
at

an
expert

the
iraqi
government
said
the
attack
was
more
likely
carried
out
by
ansar
a
predominantly
kurdish
salafist
organisation
which
had
links
to
al
qaeda
the
attack
lacked
the
sophistication
of
islamic
state
operations
he
said
daesh
should
not
be
ruled
out
he
said
using
a
arabic
acronym
used
to
describe
the
group
they
were
wearing
the
local
kurdish
outfits
used
by
ansar
there
were
no
suicide
