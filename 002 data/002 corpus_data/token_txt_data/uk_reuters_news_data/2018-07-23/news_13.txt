hedge
fund
managers
have
slashed
bullish
long
positions
in
petroleum
at
the
fastest
rate
in
more
than
a
year
as
the
gentle
in
previous
weeks
turned
into
a
rush
for
the
exit
hedge
funds
and
other

managers
cut
their
combined
net
long

in

six
most
important
futures
and

contracts
linked
to
petroleum
prices
by
million
barrels
in
the
week
to

net
long
positions
were
reduced
by
the
number
of
barrels
on
record
according
to
an
analysis
of
data
published
by
regulators
and
exchanges
going
back
to
the
first
quarter
of
the
net
long
position
in
petroleum
was
cut
below
billion
barrels
for
the
first
time
since
the
middle
of
september
the
reduction
was
concentrated
on
the
long
side
of
the
market
where
positions
were
slashed
by
million
barrels
as
managers
took
profits
after
the
rally
in
oil
prices
short
positions
rose
by
just
million
barrels
and
remain
close
to
lows
confirming
the
shift
in
net
positioning
is
being
driven
by
rather
than
any
newfound
bearishness
long
liquidation
was
concentrated
in
brent
with
net
long
positions
in
the

cut
by
million
barrels

largest
reduction
since
the
series
began

hedge
fund
managers
hold
most
of
their
positions
in
futures
and
options
with
a
relatively
short
duration
to
expiry
since
these
tend
to
offer
the
most
liquidity
so
the
has
hit
contracts
especially
hard
brent
liquidation
has
therefore
crushed
the
calendar
spreads
with
contracts
nearest
to
expiry
now
trading
in
contango
and
the
whole
of
the
first
six
months
in
a
backwardation
of
less
than
cents
per
barrel
the
accelerating
in
petroleum
futures
and
options
is
not
entirely
surprising
and
conforms
to
a
common
pattern
in
financial
markets
the
sharpest
liquidation
and
price
falls
come
not
straight
after
prices
peak
but
when
prices
have
been
under
gentle
pressure
for
some
time
and
the
initial
trickle
of
selling
finally
turns
into
a
torrent
benchmark
brent
prices
have
repeatedly
failed
to
break
up
through
the
peak
of
just
over
per
barrel
set
in
may
fund
managers
are
still
essentially
bullish
towards
the
outlook
for
oil
prices
but
the
extremely
stretched
positioning
during
the
first
quarter
has
been
partially
corrected
portfolio
managers
hold
more
than
eight
bullish
long
positions
for
every
short
bearish
position
in
the
petroleum
complex

is

for

market
analysts

traders
the

tight

the
