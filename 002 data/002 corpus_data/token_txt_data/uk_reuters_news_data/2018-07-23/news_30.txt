when
the
caribbean
island
of
barbuda
was
battered
by
hurricane
irma
last
september
about
percent
of
homes
were
destroyed
or
damaged
and
the
entire
population
had
to
be
evacuated
since
the
school
year
ended
last
month
the
pace
of
families
returning
from
neighbouring
antigua
where
many
lodged
with
relatives
or
in
centres
has
picked
up
even
though
reconstruction
is
unfinished
the
red
cross
said
almost
half
of
barbuda
s
roughly
people
have
gone
back
as
the
nation
works
on
ways
to
protect
people
from
future
disasters
while
waiting
for
promised
aid
funds
to
rebuild
homes
which
could
take
years
it
s
going
to
be
a
long
and
painful
process
antigua
and
barbuda
prime
minister
gaston
browne
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
we
just
have
to
rely
mostly
on
our
resources
and
to
find
creative
ways
to
generate
income
to
continue
the
recovery
in
the
face
of
serious
and
growing
threats
experts
detect
a
sea
change
in
many
of
the
world
s
small
island
states
and
other
remote
island
economies
that
share
development
challenges
they
are
finding
innovative
alternatives
to
lurching
from
one
crisis
to
the
next
whether
the
problem
is
extreme
weather
mass
tourism
plastic
waste
water
shortages
or
migration
barbuda
aware
it
will
take
time
to
get
back
on
its
feet
even
as
this
year
s
hurricane
season
began
in
june
aims
to
stay
safer
in
future
like
many
of
its
caribbean
neighbours
brennan
banks
red
cross
operations
manager
for
the
irma
response
said
the
aid
agency
plans
to
build
a
new
office
on
barbuda
that
can
double
up
as
an
emergency
shelter
it
is
also
offering
free
training
to
locals
and
fixing
up
systems
while
working
with
the
government
to
improve
early
warning
on
the
two
islands
such
solutions
often
developed
at
least
partly
with
islands
themselves
are
already
improving
lives
and
protecting
communities
and
environments
on
a
small
scale
but
their
fledging
efforts
need
far
more
funding
to
make
a
difference
and
lessons
learned
in
these
living
laboratories
must
be
shared
widely
say
officials
and
resilience
experts
hugh
riley
of
the
caribbean
tourism
organization
believes
the
region
is
better
prepared
for
this
year
s
hurricane
season
even
if
it
is
still
vulnerable
every
time
we
have
an
incident
of
some
kind
we
learn
from
it
he
said
the
whole
business
of
rebuilding
stronger
has
resonated
with
us
rebuilding
better
has
resonated
with
us
rebuilding
smarter
has
resonated
with
recent
improvements
include
better
government
coordination
communications
systems
that
work
more
smoothly
and
faster
evacuation
plans
he
said
according
to
a
june
report
from
the
world
bank
building
back
from
a
disaster
stronger
faster
and
in
a
way
that
includes
everybody
can
yield
major
dividends
for
small
island
nations
doing
so
would
reduce
losses
in
people
s
wellbeing
by
an
average
percent
across
a
sample
of
island
states
it
said
compared
with
percent
for
all
countries
in
the
study
for
antigua
and
barbuda
the
reduction
would
be
as
large
as
percent
stephane
hallegatte
said
the
benefits
of
reconstruction
that
also
protects
against
future
disasters
are
comparatively
large
for
small
islands
because
they
face
a
high
level
of
risk
and
exposure
to
storms
and
other
natural
threats
many
tend
to
have
housing
unable
to
resist
even
moderate
hazards
the
world
bank
economist
noted
there
is
a
lot
of
potential
for
improvement
he
said
there
are
very
cheap
those
can
be
as
simple
as
giving
local
people
who
repair
their
own
homes
tougher
roofing
materials
and
teaching
them
how
to
attach
the
roof
more
firmly
so
it
stays
on
in
high
winds
when
the
british
virgin
islands
were
blasted
by
hurricane
irma
in
september
more
than
a
third
of
the
territory
s
homes
were
destroyed
or
sustained
major
damage
authorities
say
construction
workers
have
flocked
in
from
all
corners
of
the
caribbean
working
marathon
shifts
to
rebuild
but
materials
from
windows
to
plywood
and
galvanised
roofing
are
only
arriving
in
dribs
and
drabs
from
puerto
rico
and
the
mainland
with
delays
of
up
to
three
months
the
government
is
working
on
a
new
building
code
tailored
to
more
extreme
weather
and
has
set
up
a
assistance
programme
to
help
lagging
residents
build
back
yet
some
in
the
relatively
affluent
british
overseas
territory
which
has
a
population
of

falling
through
the
cracks
it
s
as
if
the
hurricane
happened
yesterday
said
government
employee
albert
wheatley
surveying
the
debris
of
his
pink
wooden
house
now
overgrown
with
weeds
and
i
don
t
know
when
this
will
one
way
to
cut
long
waits
for
financial
help
after
a
disaster
is
to
use
social
welfare
systems
to
channel
cash
to
recipients
said
the
world
bank
s
hallegatte
after
cyclone
winston
hit
fiji
in
february
the
government
used
its
three
main
social
assistance
programmes
to
deliver
payments
equivalent
to
three
months
of
regular
benefit
to
help
residents
recover
but
many
small
island
states
have
very
little
in
terms
of
social
welfare
hallegatte
noted
disasters
can
trigger
the
establishment
of
such
schemes
however
and
the
world
bank
is
now
seeing
greater
government
interest
he
said
if
there
is
one
place
on
earth
where
you
really
want
to
design
your
social
protection
system
considering
natural
disasters
that
will
be
small
islands
he
added
resilience
advisor
stewart
said
helping
islands
withstand
the
pressures
they
face
requires
a
broad
view
encompassing
everything
from
nature
and
culture
to
economics
and
the
law
the
island
resilience
initiative
he
leads
is
working
with
palau
the
marshall
islands
and
fiji
in
the
pacific
to
track
their
progress
towards
the
global
development
goals
agreed
by
the
members
in
and
decide
on
priority
projects
the
aim
is
to
pave
the
way
to
an
approach
much
more
angled
on
resilience
and
precovery
rather
than
constantly
talking
about
recovery
after
disasters
said
in
the
british
virgin

resort
of
cane
garden
bay
the
onslaught
of
hurricane
irma
made
residents
realise
rapid
development
to
cater
for
mass
tourists
disgorged
by
cruise
ships
had
damaged
their
natural
defences
putting
them
in
harm
s
way
they
have
since
formed
a
volunteer
committee
to
restore
coral
reefs
wetlands
mangroves
and
ponds
that
trap
rainfall
running
off
hillsides
to
protect
the
village
from
future
floods
and
storms
and
preserve
its
natural
beauty
you
have
to
have
a
balance
or
you
lose
what
you
love

wrecked
by
the

we
have
decided
to
take
things
in
our
scientists
say
warmer
air
and
warmer
seas
around
the
globe
are
increasing
rainfall
and
wind
speed
in
storms
and
may
have
intensified
the
two
hurricanes
that
battered
the
caribbean
last
year
causing

direct
deaths
and
losses
estimated
at
billion
in
its
latest
flagship
report
published
in
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
pointed
to
rising
sea
levels
as
one
of
the
most
widely
recognised
climate
change
threats
to
coastal
areas
on
islands
and
atolls
combined
with
extreme
events
like
storm
surges
it
identified
severe
sea
flood
and
erosion
risks
for
islands
with
saltwater
degrading
groundwater
supplies
other
risks
from
hotter
seas
include
increased
coral
bleaching
and
reef
damage
which
could
undermine
coastal
protection
fisheries
and
tourism
hurting
island
communities
and
costing
jobs
scientists
said
in
the
report
mindful
of
those
risks
some
islands
in
the
caribbean
the
world
s
most
region
are
looking
beyond
beach
holidays
for
fresh
ways
to
entice
tourists
from
music
festivals
to
fertility
vacations
and
sports
camps
kate
brown
executive
director
of
the
global
island
partnership
glispa
an
alliance
spearheaded
by
island
leaders
believes
many
islanders
are
painfully
aware
of
climate
change
and
wider
environmental
threats
in
vanuatu
palau
and
the
seychelles
for
example
they
are
already
acting
to
manage
the
risks
whether
by
introducing
locally
managed
marine
reserves
or
banning
plastic
bags
and
straws
she
said
you
can
go
to
a
village
virtually
anywhere
and
they
understand
that
climate
change
is
impacting
them
she
added
heaps
of
changes
are
being
made
there
has
been
a
big
shift
away
from
waiting
for
other
people
to
do
one
area
that
has
seen
a
huge
push
said
brown
is
action
to
clean
up
plastic
waste
which
is
polluting
the
oceans
to
the
tune
of
million
to
million
tonnes
per
year
eight
million
tonnes
is
like
covering
an
area
times
the
size
of

according
to
a

to
organise

events
for

there
is
a
plastic
problem
in
bali
we
need
time
but
we
have
started
already
aksara
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
big
things
start
from
small
on
ibiza
a
balearic
island
off
spain
s
east
coast
known
for
its
clubbing
scene
activists
are
pooling
efforts
to
raise
awareness
of
the
growing
plastic
problem
among
its
residents
and
million
annual
visitors
love
ibiza
now
one
of
about
organisations
in
a
plastic
free
ibiza
alliance
started
in
late
june
is
promoting
beach
cleans
tote
bags
and
biodegradable
straws
for
instance
and
recruiting
villa
rental
agencies
restaurants
and
top
djs
to
help
sell
an
approach
to
tourists
the
thing
that
makes
this
is
the
small
size
of
the
island
said
sarah
drewer
who
runs
online
communications
for
love
ibiza
now
the
message
has
to
be
really
simple
and
without
to
manage
scarce
resources
better
and
grow
their
economies
cleanly
some
islands
are
turning
to
smart
technology
and
digital
solutions
on
mallorca
another
of
spain
s
four
main
balearic
islands
the
small
town
of
esporles
is
experimenting
with
the
internet
of
things
installing
sensors
to
monitor
water
consumption
and
help
detect
leaks
faster
it
plans
to
extend
its
network
to
check
on
air
pollution
and
ease
parking
problems
in
busy
summer
months
i
think
the
data
gives
us
very
valuable
information
to
analyse
it
and
understand
the
next
steps
we
need
to
take
said
the
town
s
mayor
maria
ramon
salas
meanwhile
across
europe
s
islands
authorities
are
aiming
to
adopt
renewable
energy
technologies
to
shrink
the
expense
of
providing
electricity
and
cut
their
emissions
energy
costs
on
the
continent
s
inhabited
islands
are
between
and
percent
higher
than
on
the
mainland
christopher
jones
senior
energy
advisor
at
the
european
commission
told
an
april
conference
on
smart
islands
but
in
the
past
five
years
renewables
from
solar
plants
with
battery
storage
to
offshore
wind
turbines
have
become
cheaper
and
switching
to
them
creates
jobs
he
added
today
we
have
extraordinary
opportunities
he
said
we
are
at
the
start
of
an
energy
revolution
on
the
tiny
greek
island
of
tilos
for
example
which
suffers
regular
power
cuts
is
betting
on
a
new
hybrid
wind
and
solar
power
plant
to
meet
its
electricity
needs
until
this
summer
tilos
got
all
its
electricity
from
a
diesel
power
plant
on
the
island
of
kos
km
miles
away
which
struggles
to
meet
demand
in
the
peak
tourist
season
mayor
maria
kamma
hopes
tilos
push
for
a
clean
energy
supply
will
go
beyond
keeping
hotel
lights
on
and
ensure
residents
have
a
very
good
standard
of
living
allowing
them
to
work
there
all
year
round
deterring
young
people
from
leaving
and
even
enticing
newcomers
experts
say
a
rise
in
renewable
energy
provision
on
islands
also
could
help
entrepreneurs
like
former
development
worker
joanna
edghill
she
and
her
husband
set
up
an
electric
car
company
on
the
caribbean
island
of
barbados
five
years
ago
their
business
called
megapower
has
since
sold
electric
vehicles
and
set
up
charging
stations
plus
a
handful
of
solar
on
the
island
and
is
now
expanding
in
the
region
faced
with
high
fuel
import
costs
the
caribbean
is
ripe
for
the
electrification
of
transportation
said
curtis
boodoo
an
academic
working
on
the
issue
with
the
caricom
regional
group
of
countries
sourcing
an
adequate
supply
of
food
can
also
send
import
bills
for
islands
in
the
caribbean
and
beyond
in
many
places
residents
and
visitors
get
most
of
their
food
from
shipping
containers
said
ian
mcneel
who
slow
food
barbados
which
promotes
local
organic
produce
and
runs
school
programmes
to
reconnect
children
with
farming
poor
families
in
barbados
can
spend
up
to
of
their
income
on
food
often
buying
imported
products
that
contribute
to
bad
diets
driving
obesity
and
diabetes
according
to
the
food
and
agriculture
organization
fao
but
some
caribbean
farmers
are
working
to
reverse
that
trend
by
reviving
traditional
crops
and
sharing
their
knowledge
said
arno
boersma
manager
of
the
centre
of
excellence
for
the
sustainable
development
of
small
island
developing
states
they
include
belmont
estate
a
plantation
on
grenada
that
produces
organic
cocoa
and
spices
and
runs
farm
tours
a
restaurant
and
a
museum
he
noted
besides
a
shortage
of
food
many
islands
also
suffer
from
insufficient
drinking
water
but
the
islanders
of
kavaratti
capital
of
the
lakshadweep
archipelago
a
group
of
islands
in
the
arabian
sea
off
india
are
making
their
own
once
forced
to
use
brackish
water
as
the
sea
seeped
into
their
limited
groundwater
supplies
they
now
have
a
locally
developed
desalination
plant
the
best
part
is
that
we
can
close
our
eyes
and
drink
a
glass
of
water
without
worrying
about
falling
ill
resident
khadeeja
lavanakkal
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
buoyed
by
the
project
s
success
the
national
institute
of
ocean
technology
set
up
two
more
desalination
plants
on
lakshadweep
islands
in
and
is
now
building
six
more
hoping
to
power
them
in
future
with
the
ocean
s
energy
the
common
wisdom
is
that
as
environmental
pressures
worsen
with
climate
change
making
it
harder
to
fish
farm
and
find
clean
water
some
island
populations
might
be
forced
to
look
for
a
new
home
in
the
pacific
that
has
raised
ethical
questions
about
whether
larger
countries
like
new
zealand
should
offer
humanitarian
visas
to
climate
migrants
a
policy
now
under
consideration
some
islands
such
as
kiribati
have
bought
land
elsewhere
with
a
view
to
moving
whole
communities
while
choiseul
province
in
the
solomon
islands
has
plans
to
shift
its
capital
to
a
safer
location
but
in
other
regions
where
sea
level
rise
is
less
of
an
existential
threat
some
islands
are
seeing
migrants
arrive
not
leave
and
governments
are
grappling
with
how
to
handle
them
trinidad
and
tobago
for
example
has
received
asylum
requests
from
about
venezuelans
struggling
to
survive
amid
a
political
crisis
and
harsh
recession
at
home
according
to
april
data
from
the
refugee
agency
unhcr
ambulance
driver
miguel
vegas
is
seeking
refugee
status
for
himself
and
his
family
we
just
want
permission
to
work
we
want
to
pay
taxes
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
government
of
the
nation
is
working
on
a
new
asylum
system
as
lawyers
say
the
current
process
does
not
meet
international
obligations
to
protect
asylum
seekers
but
the
influx
of
venezuelans
is
causing
anxiety
over
whether
there
are
enough
jobs
and
social
services
to
go
round
on
the
greek
island
of
tilos
which
has
welcomed
about
syrian
refugees
fleeing
war
back
home
restaurants
and
other
businesses
offer
the
newcomers
work
in
the
tourist
season
but
there
is
little
employment
for
the
rest
of
the
year
abdulkader
hamo
a
kurdish
refugee
who
left
syria
with
his
family
last
summer
says
his
children
are
happy
on
tilos
where
they
go
to
school
and
are
no
longer
afraid
of
air
strikes
nonetheless
he
is
considering
moving
elsewhere
there
is
no
work
here
it
s
not
great
for
a
family
he
said
anastasia
giannakopoulou
a
social
worker
with
greek
aid
group
solidarity
now
said
refugees
face
the
same
difficulties
as
the
local
residents
living
in
a
small
place
with
some
seeking
work
on
other
islands
in
winter
the
authorities
are
committed
to
creating
job
openings
for
everyone
such
as
a
planned
cheese
factory
using
milk
from
island
goats
that
will
employ
people
including
six
refugees
this
is
a
really
sustainable
and
profitable
business
which

refugees
in

said
tilos
mayor
kamma
while
there
is
no
shortage
of
solutions
to
island
problems
not
all
are
moving
at
the
same
speed
creating
a
hunger
for
more
knowledge
and
finance
experts
say
we
need
to
figure
out
how
to
give
a
hand
up
to
those
that
are
going
to
struggle
said
glispa
s
brown
many
island
treasuries
especially
in
the
caribbean
are
massively
indebted
and
lack
the
cash
to
build
back
better
after
disasters
or
pursue
a
more
sustainable
economic
model
some
caribbean
islands
are
selling
citizenship
and
passports
to
foreigners
for
chunky
donations
or
investments
it
s
bringing
in
an
enormous
amount
of
money
and
it
s
helping
us
to
reduce
our
debt
burden
in
a
very
serious
way
said
keith
mitchell
grenada
s
prime
minister
after
the
hurricanes
saint
kitts
and
nevis
offered
citizenship
for
a
family
of
four
in
return
for
a
payment
to
a
relief
fund
those
involved
say
vigorous
vetting
eliminates
applicants
with
criminal
backgrounds
on
international
watch
lists
or
involved
in
money
laundering
but
analysts
say
security
risks
remain
and
tax
loopholes
are
easily
exploited
overall
islands
face
big
hurdles
in
attracting
donor
funds
and
private
investment
noted
the
world
bank
s
hallegatte
their
governments
often
lack
the
staff
to
prepare
and
sell
projects
to
potential
backers
the
investment
sought
is
often
too
small
to
appeal
and
the
cost
of
making
deals
and
doing
business
is
very
high
due
to
remote
locations
he
added
but
international
development
banks
can
help
by
working
with
islands
to
group
diverse
resilience
projects
and
market
them
to
investors
as
green
bonds
hallegatte
said
regional
insurance
pools
are
also
helping
island
states
get
quick
cash
to
recovery
after
a
disaster
although
they
have
attracted
more
governments
in
the
caribbean
than
the
pacific
so
far
under
one
innovative
financing
model
eight
caribbean
island
states
have
set
up
national
trust
funds
to
protect
biodiversity
and
manage
natural
resources
wisely
and
are
putting
in
their
own
cash
to
match
donor
contributions
noted
glispa
s
brown
yet
despite
exciting
developments
there
remains
a
gap
in
securing
investment
on
the
scale
required
she
added
there
a
huge
amount
of
resources
needed
for
islands
to
get
to
where
they
want
to
be
and
also
just
to
become
more
resilient
to
all
the
changes
that
are
going
on
