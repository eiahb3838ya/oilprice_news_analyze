several

familiar
with

aramco

boosting

morgan
stanley
had
already
been
among
the

assisting
aramco
on
its
ipo
aramco
s
initial
thinking
is
to
buy
the
full
stake
owned
by
the
pif
but
if
that
fails
to
materialise
aramco
could
end
up
with
a
stake
in
sabic
of
more
than
percent
making
it
a
majority
owner
two
of
the
sources
said
no
final
decision
has

the
size
of
the
stake
