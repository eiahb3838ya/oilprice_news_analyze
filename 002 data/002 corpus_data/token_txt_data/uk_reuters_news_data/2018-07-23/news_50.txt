crude
oil
isn
t
formally
part
of
the
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
but
it
may
well
be
the
first
major
flow
to
be
disrupted
significantly
by
the
rising
tensions
one
of
the
successes
in
the
efforts
to
lower
the
trade
surplus
enjoyed
by
china
over
the
united
states
was
exports
of
crude
a
result
of
the
shale
oil
boom
that
has
taken
the
to
within
a
whisker
of
being
the
world
s
top
oil
producer
crude
exports
from
the
united
states
to
china
have
surged
this
year
with
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
oil
research
and
forecasts
showing
china
imported
million
barrels
or
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
oil
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
this
was
up
from
just
million
barrels
or
bpd
over
the
same
period
last
year
according
to
the
data
much
of
the
gain
so
far
this
year
has
been
in
recent
months
with
the
april
to
july
period
being
four
of
the
five
strongest
months
on
record
and
january
this
year
being
the
other
july
is
set
to
be
the
month
for
chinese
imports
of
crude
with
the
data
pointing
to
the
arrival
of
million
barrels
or
about
bpd
expected
shipments
in
august
appear
to
be
heading
substantially
lower
however
with
only
million
barrels
or
about
bpd
expected
to
arrive
at
chinese
ports
while
these
numbers
may
still
change
they
are
unlikely
to
shift
much
given
the
typical
journey
between
ports
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
china
this
means
all
cargoes
slated
to
arrive
in
china
in
august
should
have
already
left
it
also
means
most
cargoes
likely
to
arrive
in
september
would
also
have
departed
the
united
states
but
so
far
no
such
fixtures
are
showing
this
doesn
t
mean
there
will
be
zero
crude
exports
arriving
china
in
september
but
it
does
raise
the
possibility
that
there
will
be
a
sharp
decline
to
put
it
in
perspective
of
the
cargoes
unloaded
in
china
in
june
nine
left
ports
in
april
given
there
is
only
one
week
left
of
july
and
no
cargoes
have
yet
left
the
for
arrival
in
china
in
september
it
seems
risks
are
rising
that
oil
shipments
to
china
are
falling
off
a
cliff
this
may
add
to
the
existing
trade
tensions
between
china
and
president
donald
trump
who
has
made
it
clear
he
wants
a
lower
trade
deficit
with
china
if
crude
oil
exports
do
plummet
though
the
trade
deficit
is
likely
headed
higher
notwithstanding
tariffs
already
placed
on
some
chinese
exports
by
the
trump
administration
while
this
sounds
like
a
poor
outcome
for
crude
exporters
there
is
evidence
suggesting
other
importers
in
north
asia
are
taking
up
cargoes
no
longer
being
bought
by
china
south
korea
may
import
a
record
amount
of
crude
in
september
with
data
pointing
to
the
arrival
of
million
barrels
or
about
bpd
japan
may
bring
in
million
barrels
in
september
or
about
bpd
the
highest
since
january
this
year
taiwan
s
imports
from
the
united
states
are
slated
at
million
bpd
for
august
or
about
bpd
which
would
be
the
highest
on
record
while
additional
imports
from
japan
south
korea
and
taiwan
are
probably
insufficient
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
chinese
purchases
they
will
provide
some
comfort
to
oil
exporters
but
they
are
also
unlikely
to
do
anything
to
ease
the
trade
tensions
between
the
trump
administration
and
china
the
looming
slump
in
china
s
purchases
of
crude
may
be
taken
as
a
sign
that
beijing
is
prepared
to
fight
back
against
trump
even
if
the
tactics
are
somewhat
different
rather
than
impose
tariffs
china
may
simply
persuade
its
refiners
to
move
away
from
buying
crude
this
means
pain
can
be
inflicted
on
the
united
states
without
needing
to
impose
tariffs
or
resorting
to
the
bombastic
rhetoric
that
typifies
the
trump
administration

opinions
expressed
here
are
