europe
s
bond
yields
climbed
after
a
reuters
report
that
the
boj
was
discussing
modifying
its
huge
easing
programme
sent
japan
s
bond
yield
to
a
high
the
report
rekindled
anxieties
about
global
monetary
policy
easing
and
piled
further
pressure
on
investors
already
struggling
to
navigate
rising
protectionism
and
tense
geopolitics
the
yield
on
europe
s
benchmark
bond
the
german
bund
hit
a
high
of
percent
while
treasury
yields
also
hit
their
highest
in
a
month
at
percent
the
yen
climbed
to
highs
against
the
dollar
and
was
last
up
percent
at
per
dollar
it
s
all
that
concern
investors
have
about
the
move
from
global
quantitative
easing
to
global
quantitative
tightening
that
fear
gets
stoked
when
you
have
reports
such
as
this
said
rory
mcpherson
head
of
investment
strategy
at
psigma
investment
management
the
ecb
meeting
this
week
will
be
more
in
focus
now
that
we
ve
had
this
concern
about
the
dollar
index
meanwhile
languished
at
lows
after
president
trump
criticised
the
federal
reserve
s
tightening
policy
and
accused
the
european
union
and
china
of
manipulating
their
currencies
we
see
the
latest
news
on
trade
policy
as
pointing
to
continued
high
risk
of
escalation
between
the
and
china
and
a
renewed
focus
of
the
trump
administration
on
currency
matters
said
goldman
sachs
analysts
trump
s
comments
against
fed
rate
hikes
also
helped
steepen
the
treasury
yield
curve
trump
s
new
threats
to
slap
duties
on
all
imports
from
china
triggered
across
stock
markets
though
good
corporate
earnings
kept
a
lid
on
losses
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
fell
percent
and
the
msci
world
index
declined
just
percent
europe
s
stoxx
fell
percent
as
investors
braced
for
a
packed
week
of
corporate
earnings
in
europe
and
a
meeting
between
european
commissioner
juncker
and
trump
to
discuss
threatened
auto
tariffs
which
could
damage
carmakers
goldman
sachs
analysts
said
auto
tariffs
if
they
came
to
pass
would
likely
cause
weakness
in
the
canadian
dollar
and
mexican
peso
possibly
also
affecting
the
euro
pound
yen
and
korean
won
as
investors
priced
in
a
hit
to
the
economy
the
global
economy
is
still
ok
but
the
risk
is
now
very
high
and
if
trade
policies
don
t
make
a
very
soon
we
ll
see
a
measurable
impact
on
growth
already
next
year
said
unicredit
chief
economist
erik
nielsen
the
euro
which
has
been
gaining
from

weakness

governors
at
the
meeting
in
buenos
aires
said
the
risks
to
global
economic
growth
have
increased
due
to
trade
and
geopolitical
tensions
