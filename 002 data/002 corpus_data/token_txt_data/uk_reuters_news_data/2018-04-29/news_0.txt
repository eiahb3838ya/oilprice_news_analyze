pakistani
opposition
figure
imran
khan
on
sunday
vowed
to
sweep
to
power
in
upcoming
elections
promising
radical
change
for
the
poor
at
a
campaign
rally
in
the
city
of
lahore
that
has
long
been
the
power
base
of
ousted
premier
nawaz
sharif
with
the
minarets
of
lahore
s
badshahi
mosque
in
sight
khan
outlined
a
populist
plan
to
usher
in
a
new
era
of
prosperity
that
he
envisages
for
pakistan
after
the
general
election
at
which
he
hopes
to
become
prime
minister
today
we
are
at
crossroads
said
khan
a
former
cricketing
hero
and
founder
of
the
pakistan
pti
party
it
is
time
to
change
our
destiny
and
think
khan
told
a
boisterous
crowd
of
about
people
that
pakistan
was
heading
towards
destruction
but
his
plan
would
help
forge
a
fairer
society
and
steer
pakistan
towards
a
path
first
envisaged
by
the
nation
s
father
muhammad
ali
jinnah
khan
said
that
if
elected
he
would
build
schools
and
world
class
hospitals
across
the
country
while
farmers
would
get
cheap
loans
he
also
pledged
to
build
million
homes
for
the
poor
which
would
create
jobs
and
stimulate
the
economy
after
spending
much
of
his
political
career
on
the
fringes
khan
has
in
recent
years
emerged
as
a
key
challenger
to
sharif
a
prime
minister
who
was
ousted
by
the
supreme
court
last
year
but
whose
party
retains
power
sharif
s
legal
woes
which
the
veteran
leader
says
are
politically
motivated
could
further
boost
khan
in
the
run
up
to
the
elections
as
an
court
is
due
to
soon
deliver
a
verdict
on
another
sharif
trial
khan
has
predicted
sharif
will
be
jailed
before
the
polls
likely
in
july
khan
who
has
sought
to
shed
his
playboy
image
of
the
past
is
betting
that
his
message
coupled
with
rhetoric
and
a
projecting
image
of
pious
devotion
will
propel
him
into
power
in
the
deeply
conservative
muslim
nation
of
million
people
in
lahore
khan
s
message
resonated
with
many
of
the
young
men
waving
pti
s
green
and
flags
imran
khan
has
given
us
the
slogan
of
new
pakistan
and
that
s
what
we
want
said
shahzad
khan
in
reference
to
the
naya
pakistan
slogan
used
by
pti
sharif
has
accused
khan
of
being
a
puppet
of
the
powerful
military
establishment
that
has
a
history
of
meddling
in
pakistani
politics
khan
denies
colluding
with
the
army
and
the
military
denies
interfering
in
politics
to
dislodge
sharif
s
pakistan
muslim
party
khan
s
pti
will
have
to
make
inroads
into
pakistan
s
biggest
province
which
is
home
to
million
people
and
a
electoral
machine
built
over
several
decades
sharif
was
the
chief
minister
of
punjab
in
the
and
his
younger
brother
shahbaz
has
ruled
the
province
since
entrenching
s
support
across
the
wealthiest
of
pakistan
s
four
provinces
we
feel
they
are
weakening
with
every
day
khan
told
foreign
journalist
ahead
of
the
rally
he
added
that
unlike
in
when
swept
to
power
this
time
around
many
of
the
electables
politicians
who
carry
large
rural
vote
banks
due
to
their
status
as
tribal
elders
feudal
lords
and
heads
of
various
clans
will
switch
allegiances
away
from
to
pti
the
electables
weigh
things
up
they
want
to
be
on
the
winning
side
khan
told
foreign
media
but
at
the
lahore
rally
khan
shunned
talk
of
electables
and
focused
on
promising
a
new
dawn
for
pakistan
s
poor
this
system
can
not
run
unless
we
stand
up
with
the
downtrodden
he
said
i
am
standing
with
you
it
is
time
