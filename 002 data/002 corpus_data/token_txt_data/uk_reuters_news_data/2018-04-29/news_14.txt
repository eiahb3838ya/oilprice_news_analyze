britain
s
prime
minister
theresa
may
is
under
pressure
to
introduce
legislation
guaranteeing
promises
made
to
residents
from
the
caribbean
who
have
being
incorrectly
labelled
illegal
immigrants
for
almost
two
weeks
british
ministers
have
been
struggling
to
explain
why
some
descendants
of
the
windrush
generation
invited
to
britain
to
plug
labour
shortfalls
between
and
are
being
denied
basic
rights
because
of
trouble
documenting
their
status
the
windrush
scandal
overshadowed
the
commonwealth
summit
in
london
earlier
this
month
and
has
raised
questions
about
may
s
stint
as
interior
minister
before
she
became
prime
minister
in
the
wake
of
the
brexit
referendum
the
government
has
apologised
for
the
fiasco
promised
citizenship
and
compensation
to
those
affected
including
to
people
who
have
lost
their
jobs
been
threatened
with
deportation
and
denied
benefits
because
of
the
errors
but
more
than
mainly
opposition
members
of
parliament
have
written
to
the
prime
minister
calling
for
the
pledges
to
be
written
into
law
without
delay
the
letter
accuses
the
interior
minister
amber
rudd
who
has
faced
calls
to
resign
over
her
handling
of
the
scandal
of
making
up
policy
on
the
hoof
to
defuse
the
situation
rudd
is
due
to
address
parliament
on
monday
after
giving
contradictory
statements
about
whether
the
government
has
immigration
removal
targets
in
a
separate
letter
the
shadow
interior
minister
diane
abbott
has
called
for
a
full
inquiry
into
whether
the
interior
minister
misled
parliament
and
breached
the
ministerial
code
abbott
said
rudd
s
explanations
as
to
why
she
had
told
members
of
parliament
there
were
no
such
targets
when
in
fact
there
were
stretch
credulity
to
the
limit
but
may
s
office
said
there
is
no
need
for
an
investigation
because
ministerial
code
only
requires
a
resignation
if
a
minister
knowingly
misleads
parliament
a
charge
