london
reuters
britain
s
interior
minister
amber
rudd
was
under
growing
pressure
on
sunday
after
a
challenge
to
her
testimony
on
the
deportation
of
immigrants
prompted
fresh
calls
for
her
resignation
the
guardian
newspaper
reported
a
letter
from
rudd
to
prime
minister
theresa
may
last
year
in
which
she
stated
an
ambitious
but
deliverable
aim
for
an
increase
in
the
enforced
deportation
of
immigrants
earlier
her
former
deputy
said
he
discussed
with
her
attempts
to
increase
the
number
of
government
deportations
but
he
said
the
increase
was
an
ambition
rather
than
a
target
the
controversy
surrounding
one
of
may
s
closest
allies
coincides
with
britain
entering
crucial
negotiations
on
a
future
trade
deal
with
the
european
union
and
amid
rising
domestic
tension
over
brexit
policy
for
the
last
two
weeks
british
ministers
have
struggled
to
explain
why
some
descendants
of
the
windrush
generation
invited
to
britain
from
caribbean
nations
to
plug
labour
shortfalls
between
and
are
being
denied
basic
rights
because
of
trouble
documenting
their
status
the
scandal
overshadowed
the
commonwealth
summit
in
london
earlier
this
month
and
has
raised
questions
about
may
s
stint
as
interior
minister
before
she
became
prime
minister
in
the
wake
of
the
brexit
referendum
the
government
has
apologised
for
the
fiasco
promised
citizenship
and
compensation
to
those
affected
including
to
people
who
have
lost
their
jobs
been
threatened
with
deportation
and
denied
benefits
because
of
the
errors
but
more
than
mainly
opposition
members
of
parliament
have
written
to
the
prime
minister
calling
for
the
pledges
to
be
written
into
law
without
delay
the
letter
accuses
the
rudd
of
making
up
policy
on
the
hoof
to
defuse
the
situation
rudd
is
due
to
make
a
statement
to
parliament
on
monday
after
giving
contradictory
statements
about
whether
the
government
has
immigration
removal
targets
the
pressure
on
rudd
to
stand
down
increased
after
she
said
the
government
didn
t
have
targets
for
deporting
people
only
for
a
memo
to
emerge
mentioning
specific
targets
for
enforced
removals
rudd
was
facing
new
questions
about
whether
she
misled
parliament
after
her
former
deputy
said
on
sunday
he
discussed
with
her
a
plan
to
increase
deportations
by
percent
brandon
lewis
now
the
conservative
party
chairman
told
the
bbc
in
an
interview
that
targets
were
very
different
from
an
aim
to
increase
the
number
of
removals
referred
to
in
the
memo
labour
accused
him
of
hiding
behind
semantics
in
an
effort
to
save
rudd
s
career
he
let
the
truth
slip
and
sealed
her
fate
amber
rudd
knew
of
the
targets
she
pretended
didn
t
exist
the
shadow
interior
minister
diane
abbott
said
it
s
time
for
rudd
to
in
a
separate
letter
abbott
has
called
for
a
full
inquiry
into
whether
the
interior
minister
misled
parliament
and
breached
the
ministerial
code
abbott
said
rudd
s
explanations
as
to
why
she
had
told
members
of
parliament
there
were
no
such
targets
when
in
fact
there
were
stretch
credulity
to
the
limit
but
may
s
office
said
there
is
no
need
for
an
investigation
because
ministerial
code
only
requires
a
resignation
if
a
minister
knowingly
misleads
parliament
a
charge
the
interior
minister
denies
