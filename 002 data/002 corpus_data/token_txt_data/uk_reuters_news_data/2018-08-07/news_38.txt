berlin
reuters
germany
is
considering
tighter
controls
on
foreign
investments
as
concerns
over
chinese
takeovers
of
strategically
important
technology
firms
mount
berlin
wants
the
power
to
investigate
if
an
investor
outside
the
european
union
buys
at
least
percent
of
certain
german
or
technology
firms
an
economy
ministry
source
said
on
tuesday
germany
tightened
controls
on
foreign
investments
last
year
after
a
series
of
takeovers
by
chinese
companies
making
it
possible
for
the
government
to
intervene
if
a
buyer
amassed
a
shareholding
of
percent
and
the
german
government
last
week
signalled
it
was
prepared
to
use
a
new
power
to
veto
foreign
takeovers
of
german
companies
in
the
case
of
a
chinese
bid
for
toolmaker
leifeld
this
came
after
leifeld
s
majority
owner
georg
koffler
said
china
s
yantai
taihai
had
dropped
its
attempt
to
buy
the
company
ahead
of
an
expected
veto
by
the
german
government
the
source
did
not
name
specific
companies
but
said
sensitive
sectors
included
operators
of
critical
infrastructure
like
cloud
computing
drinking
water
suppliers
and
sewage
disposal
systems
systems
of
cash
supply
hospital
information
systems
air
traffic
systems
and
local
public
transport
last
month
a
german
state
bank
bought
a
stake
in
grid
operator
to
prevent
china
s
state
grid
acquiring
the
shareholding
and
promised
to
consider
ways
of
better
protecting
companies
from
foreign
acquisition
the
economy
ministry
should
now
be
able
to
investigate
if
a
investor
acquires
a
shareholding
of
at
least
percent
of
voting
rights
in
the
companies
concerned
the
source
said
german
newspaper
die
welt
first
reported
the
proposal
to
change
the
german
foreign
trade
ordinance
said
it
was
being
coordinated
with
other
ministries
and
added
that
a
law
that
provides
for
more
control
could
come
into
effect
this
year
until
now
we
ve
only
been
able
to
make
checks
when
at
least
percent
of
a
company
s
shares
have
been
acquired
now
we
want
to
lower
this
threshold
so
we
can
review
more
acquisitions
in
sensitive
economic
sectors
die
welt
quoted
german
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
as
saying
in
germany
and
other
countries
including
the
united
states
france
australia
and
britain
there
are
concerns
that
china
and
other
rivals
are
gaining
access
to
key
technologies
via
takeovers
members
of
the
european
parliament
are
nearing
agreement
on
a
proposal
that
would
broaden
the
powers
of
the
european
commission
to
scrutinize
foreign
investments
amid
rising
concern
about
chinese
acquisitions
on
the
continent
joachim
lang
managing
director
of
germany
s
bdi
industry
association
sounded
cautious
about
the
plans
saying
foreign
investment
was
important
for
germany
and
the
investment
climate
needed
to
remain
open
he
said
the
government
needed
to
proceed
in
a
measured
way
in
amending
the
german
foreign
trade
ordinance
but
it
was
good
that
the
government
wanted
to
make
conditions
clear
because
investors
needed
legal
certainty
lowering
the
investigation
threshold
must
be
limited
to
sensitive
areas
and
must
be
strictly
oriented
towards
protecting
national
security
lang
added
the
head
of
germany
s
domestic
intelligence
service
has
said
that
chinese
state
actors
seeking
trade
secrets
could
be
behind
bids
that
nominally
came
from
private
firms
highlighting
a
seeming
correlation
between
a
decline
in
hacking
attempts
originating
from
china
with
an
increase
in
bids
