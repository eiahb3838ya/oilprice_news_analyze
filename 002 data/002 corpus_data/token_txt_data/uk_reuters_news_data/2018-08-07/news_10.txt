california defies trump, plans tighter rules on vehicle emissions
washington
reuters
california
air
regulators
on
tuesday
said
they
plan
to
keep
tightening
state
vehicle
emissions
rules
despite
a
trump
administration
proposal
last
week
that
would
strip
the
state
of
the
ability
to
set
its
own
limits
the
california
air
resources
board
carb
proposed
maintaining
strict
rules
mandating
rising
fuel
efficiency
requirements
annually
through
the
trump
administration
has
proposed
freezing
federal
vehicle
emissions
requirements
at
levels
through
california
will
take
all
actions
to
ensure
that
the
smart
standards
we
developed
in
partnership
with
the
auto
industry
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
from
vehicles
stay
in
place
said
carb
chair
mary
nichols
in
a
statement
from
sacramento
dirty
gas
guzzling
vehicles
are
a
direct
assault
on
public
health
and
foreclose
our
ability
to
rein
in
air
pollution
and
greenhouse
gases
she
added
california
s
decision
is
nationally
significant
because
the
state
is
the
largest
auto
market
also
a
dozen
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
have
adopted
california
s
emissions
rules
accounting
for
more
than
a
third
of
all
vehicle
sales
california
is
seeking
public
comments
on
ways
to
make
the
rules
more
flexible
while
still
meeting
goals
to
reduce
carbon
emissions
the
trump
administration
said
the
obama
era
rules
were
not
appropriate
and
its
freeze
would
help
make
vehicles
more
affordable
it
said
that
under
its
proposal
vehicles
would
average
miles
per
gallon
in
compared
with
mpg
under
the
obama
rule
california
and
other
states
said
last
week
they
will
fight
the
trump
administration
s
freeze
in
court
a
legal
battle
that
could
leave
automakers
in
regulatory
limbo
for
years
last
month
nichols
told
reuters
california
wants
to
work
with
automakers
on
revisions
and
she
sees
a
window
for
a
deal
in
coming
months
two
trade
groups
representing
general
motors
co
volkswagen
ag
toyota
motor
corp
and
other
major
automakers
sent
letters
to
california
governor
jerry
brown
and
president
donald
trump
last
week
urging
negotiations
for
a
compromise
on
one
set
of
nationwide
rules
automakers
want
changes
to
address
shifts
in
consumer
demand
but
also
favor
efficiency
requirements
continuing
to
rise
california
said
under
the
trump
administration
s
preferred
option
emissions
could
increase
by
almost
million
metric
tons
per
year
by
the
administration
says
freezing
the
limits
would
have
little
impact
on
average
global
temperature
even
as
projected
oil
consumption
would
increase
by
about
barrels
daily
california
has
received
a
waiver
to
set
its
own
emissions
rules
as
well
as
authority
to
require
automakers
to
build
a
rising
number
of
vehicles
the
trump
administration
has
proposed
revoking
that
authority
