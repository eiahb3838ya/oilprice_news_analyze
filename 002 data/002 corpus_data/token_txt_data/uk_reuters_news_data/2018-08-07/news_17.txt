update 1-venezuela dodges oil asset seizures with export transfers at sea
fijo
reuters
venezuela
s
oil
company
pdvsa
has
limited
the
damage
from
an
unprecedented
slump
in
crude
exports
by
transferring
oil
between
tankers
at
sea
and
loading
vessels
in
neighboring
cuba
to
avoid
asset
seizures
but
the
opec
member
nation
is
still
fulfilling
less
than
percent
of
its
obligations
under
supply
deals
with
customers
venezuela
has
been
pumping
oil
this
year
at
the
lowest
rate
in
three
decades
after
years
of
underinvestment
and
a
mass
exodus
of
workers
the
firm
s
collapse
has
left
the
country
short
of
cash
to
fund
its
embattled
socialist
government
and
triggered
an
economic
crisis
pdvsa
s
problems
were
compounded
in
may
when
oil
firm
conocophillips
began
seizing
pdvsa
assets
in
the
caribbean
as
payment
for
a
billion
arbitration
award
an
arbitration
panel
at
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
icc
ordered
pdvsa
to
pay
the
cash
to
compensate
conoco
for
expropriating
the
firm
s
venezuelan
assets
in
the
seizures
left
pdvsa
without
access
to
facilities
such
as
isla
refinery
in
curacao
and
bopec
terminal
in
bonaire
that
accounted
for
almost
a
quarter
of
the
company
s
oil
exports
conoco
s
actions
also
forced
pdvsa
to
stop
shipping
oil
on
its
own
vessels
to
terminals
in
the
caribbean
and
then
onto
refineries
worldwide
to
avoid
the
risk
the
cargoes
would
be
seized
in
international
waters
or
foreign
ports
instead
pdvsa
asked
customers
to
charter
tankers
to
venezuelan
waters
and
load
from
the
company
s
own
terminals
or
from
anchored
pdvsa
vessels
acting
as
floating
storage
units
the
company
told
some
clients
in
early
june
it
might
impose
force
majeure
a
temporary
suspension
of
export
contracts
unless
they
agreed
to
such
transfers
pdvsa
also
requested
the
customers
stop
sending
vessels
to
its
terminals
until
it
could
load
those
that
were
already
clogging
venezuela
s
coastline
initially
customers
were
reluctant
to
undertake
the
transfers
because
of
costs
safety
concerns
and
the
need
for
specialist
equipment
and
experienced
crew
but
pdvsa
has
managed
to
export
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
oil
since
early
july
up
from
just
bpd
in
the
first
half
of
june
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
and
internal
pdvsa
shipping
data
seen
by
reuters
that
was
still
percent
of
the
country
s
million
bpd
in
contractual
obligations
to
customers
for
that
period
and
some
vessels
are
still
waiting
for
weeks
in
venezuelan
waters
to
load
oil
there
were
about
two
dozen
tankers
waiting
this
week
to
load
over
million
barrels
of
crude
and
refined
products
at
the
country
s
largest
ports
according
to
reuters
data
we
are
not
tied
to
one
option
or
a
single
loading
terminal
pdvsa
president
manuel
quevedo
said
on
tuesday
of
the
company
s
exports
we
have
several
terminals
in
our
country
and
we
have
some
in
the
caribbean
which
of
course
facilitate
crude
shipping
to
fulfill
our
supply
pdvsa
has
also
used
a
route
through
cuba
to
ease
the
impact
of
the
conoco
seizures
that
route
is
for
fuel
rather
than
crude
the
venezuelan
company
has
used
a
terminal
at
the
port
of
matanzas
as
a
conduit
mostly
for
exporting
fuel
oil
according
to
two
people
familiar
with
the
operations
and
thomson
reuters
shipping
data
venezuela
s
fuel
oil
is
burned
in
some
countries
to
generate
electricity
two
tankers
set
sail
from
the
matanzas
terminal
for
singapore
between
and
early
july
reuters
data
showed
each
ship
carried
around
barrels
of
venezuelan
fuel
reuters
data
shows
in
recent
months
venezuela
has
been
shipping
fuel
to
matanzas
in
small
batches
according
to
the
data
pdvsa
and
cuba
s
oil
firm
cupet
have
used
matanzas
to
store
venezuelan
crude
and
fuel
in
the
past
but
exports
from
the
terminal
to
asian
destinations
are
rare
that
is
in
part
because
vessels
that
use
cuban
ports
can
not
subsequently
dock
in
the
united
states
due
to
the
commercial
embargo
on
cuba
cupet
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
pdvsa
has
also
used
transfers
to
fulfill
an
unusual
supply
contract
it
has
with
cuba
s
cienfuegos
refinery
the
refinery
dates
from
the
when
cuba
was
a
close
ally
of
the
soviet
union
during
the
cold
war
and
the
facility
was
built
to
process
russian
crude
pdvsa
typically
uses
its
own
or
leased
tankers
to
bring
russian
crude
from
storage
in
the
nearby
dutch
caribbean
island
of
curacao
to
cienfuegos
but
it
is
now
discharging
the
imported
russian
oil
at
sea
in
cayman
islands
waters
via
these
seaborne
transfers
conocophillips
last
month
ratcheted
up
its
collection
efforts
by
moving
to
depose
officials
from
citgo
petroleum
pdvsa
s
refining
arm
arguing
it
had
improperly
claimed
ownership
of
some
pdvsa
cargoes
citgo
declined
to
comment
conocophillips
is
also
preparing
new
legal
actions
to
get
caribbean
courts
to
recognize
its
international
chamber
of
commerce
arbitration
award
if
it
succeeds
in
those
efforts
it
would
be
able
to
sell
the
assets
to
help
satisfy
the
ruling
