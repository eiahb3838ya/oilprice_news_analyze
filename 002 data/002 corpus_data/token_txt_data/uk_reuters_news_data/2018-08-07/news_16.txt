nigeria
s
security
forces
stopped
lawmakers
entering
parliament
on
tuesday
in
a
blockade
seen
by
the
opposition
as
a
bid
to
intimidate
its
leaders
but
the
presidency
condemned
the
move
and
the
acting
president
fired
the
head
of
the
security
agency
it
is
the
first
such
incident
since
nigeria
became
a
democracy
in
and
coincides
with
increased
tension
between
the
national
assembly
and
the
executive
ahead
of
an
election
in
february
when
president
muhammadu
buhari
will
seek
a
second
term
for
some
it
revived
memories
of
the
decades
when
the
military
and
security
forces
held
sway
over
politics
in
a
country
that
has
one
of
africa
s
largest
economies
armed
men
wearing
the
black
uniform
of
the
department
of
state
security
dss
stood
at
the
gates
of
the
building
in
the
capital
abuja
and
were
later
joined
by
police
officers
blocking
entry
for
up
to
an
hour
witnesses
said
images
of
the
incident
were
shared
widely
on
social
media
the
motive
for
the
blockade
was
not
immediately
clear
but
a
spokesman
for
vice
president
yemi
osinbajo
said
in
a
statement
that
the
dss
director
general
lawal
musa
daura
had
been
fired
osinbajo
is
acting
president
for
buhari
who
last
week
left
for
a
holiday
in
britain
the
unlawful
act
which
was
done
without
the
knowledge
of
the
presidency
is
condemnable
and
completely
unacceptable
said
a
separate
statement
issued
later
by
osinbajo
s
office
it
described
the
move
as
an
unauthorised
takeover
of
the
national
assembly
complex
which
was
a
gross
violation
of
constitutional
order
rule
of
law
and
all
accepted
notions
of
law
and
order
the
statement
gave
no
reason
for
daura
s
dismissal
the
presidency
later
said
matthew
seiyefa
the
most
senior
director
in
the
dss
will
act
as
director
general
until
further
notice
the
blockade
followed
the
defection
of
around
lawmakers
from
buhari
s
ruling
all
progressives
congress
apc
party
to
the
main
opposition
in
the
last
few
weeks
these
included
the
country
s
third
most
senior
elected
official
senate
president
bukola
saraki
the
defections
cost
the
apc
its
senate
majority
and
present
a
challenge
to
buhari
s
bid
because
most
of
those
who
left
joined
the
opposition
people
s
democratic
party
which
ruled
nigeria
from
until
buhari
took
office
in
may
saraki
s
supporters
said
the
blockade
was
part
of
a
plan
to
impeach
and
replace
him
parliament
went
on
recess
last
week
until
but
meetings
were
to
be
held
on
tuesday
we
urge
nigerians
and
the
international
community
to
condemn
this
illegal
invasion
of
the
national
assembly
complex
and
the
attempt
to
asphyxiate
the
legislature
as
undemocratic
uncivilized
and
irresponsible
said
saraki
in
a
tweet
after
the
blockade
saraki
s
supporters
greeted
him
with
chanting
in
the
parliament
building
the
presidency
s
sack
of
daura
was
a
stunt
and
a
gimmick
which
came
as
a
response
to
the
national
and
international
outcry
against
the
armed
invasion
of
our
legislature
said
a
pdp
statement
the
ruling
party
said
attempts
to
blame
its
leaders
for
tuesday
s
blockade
were
false
allegations
and
mischievous
the
use
of
armed
security
agents
to
force
political
outcomes
does
not
bode
well
for
the
february
general
election
