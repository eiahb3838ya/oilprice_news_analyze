one

about
five
million
homes
for
a
day
the
facility
represents
percent
of
the
utility
s
gas
storage
capacity
making
it
a
key
part

the
company

ability
to
deliver
fuel
to
customers
especially
on
the
coldest
winter
days
when
demand
for

is
highest
and
the
hottest
summer

they
have
also
said
the
company
can
only
withdraw
gas
from
the
facility
when
other
options
are
not
available

meet
demand
many
residents
and

officials
want

to
shut

has
said
it
expects
to
complete
its
evaluation
under
