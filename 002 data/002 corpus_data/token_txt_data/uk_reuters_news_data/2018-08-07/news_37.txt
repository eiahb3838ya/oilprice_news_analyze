crude
oil
producers
appear
to
have
found
an
alternative
buyer
for
cargoes
no
longer
heading
to
china
with
india
on
track
to
import
record
volumes
in
august
india
has
booked
a
total
of
million
barrels
of
crude
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
arrive
from
the
united
states
this
month
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
oil
research
and
forecasts
this
would
be
almost
triple
the
bpd
india
imported
from
the
united
states
in
july
and
well
above
the
bpd
for
november
last
year
the
previous
record
for
a
month
the
august
total
is
also
likely
to
be
just
above
the
million
barrels
imported
over
the
first
seven
months
showing
the
scale
of
acceleration
in
india

imports

indian
refiners
interest
in
crude
will
be
welcome
news
to
shale
producers
looking
for
buyers
outside
of
china
which
is
likely
to
scale
back
imports
as
the
trade
dispute
between
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
and
beijing
escalates
although
not
imposed
as
yet
china
has
proposed
import
taxes
of
up
to
percent
on
crude
as
well
as
on
liquefied
natural
gas
and
coal
while
crude
exports
to
china
appear
to
have
held
up
in
august
with
about
bpd
expected
to
arrive
they
seem
set
for
a
slump
in
september
so
far
about
bpd
of
crude
have
been
booked
for
arrival
in
china
next
month
according
to
data
and
the
window
for
more
cargoes
to
be
added
is
closing
given
it
takes
at
least
three
weeks
for
a
tanker
to
make
the
journey
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
china
s
east
coast
for
crude
exporters
india
is
a
market
ripe
for
expansion
given
the
voyage
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
india
s
west
coast
takes
about
three
weeks
much
the
same
as
it
does
to
china
s
east
coast
this
means
shipping
costs
are
more
or
less
in
line
with
sending
cargoes
to
china
indian
refiners
may
also
be
seeking
alternative
suppliers
as
they
may
be
compelled
to
cut
purchases
from
iran
iranian
oil
exports
are
under
a
cloud
because
of
renewed
sanctions
as
part
of
the
trump
administration
s
withdrawal
from
the
international
agreement
aimed
at
curbing
iran
s
nuclear
programme
it
must
be
especially
galling
for
tehran
s
leaders
that
they
stand
to
lose
market
share
in
india
to
the
united
states
however
there
is
no
sign
yet
that
india
is
cutting
back
on
imports
from
iran
with
a
record
bpd
arriving
in
july
according
to
preliminary
tanker
data
it
s
likely
though
that
the
percent
surge
in
imports
from
june
was
a
result
of
indian
refiners
buying
as
much
as
they
could
before
they
have
to
cut
back
as
the
renewed
sanctions
come
into
force
still
indian
refiners
are
believed
to
be
encountering
difficulties
in
insuring
cargoes
from
iran
and
tehran
is
offering
to
insure
vessels
itself
as
well
as
providing
generous
payment
and
freight
terms
whether
this
will
allow
iran
to
keep
exporting
to
india
remains
to
be
seen
but
tehran
will
be
especially
keen
to
keep
its
relationship
with
its
customer
after
china
the
expected
paring
of
india
s
imports
from
iran
after
this
month
and
the
increase
in
purchases
from
the
united
states
also
raise
questions
about
the
politics
of
oil
india
is
the
world
s
crude
importer
and
if
it
cuts
its
purchases
from
iran
another
likely
major
beneficiary
besides
the
united
states
is
tehran
s
regional
rival
and
trump
ally
saudi
arabia
india
imported
about
bpd
from
saudi
arabia
in
july
according
to
the
data
a
figure
that
is
considerably
higher
than
the
average
of
bpd
for
the
first
six
months
of
while
it
s
likely
that
saudi
arabia
is
keen
to
limit
iran
s
influence
in
the
middle
east
it
appears
the
kingdom
could
also
be
in
for
a
benefit
of
increasing
its
exports
to
fill
the
gap
left
by
iran
and
selling
at
higher
prices
assuming
the
market
tightens
on
the
loss
of
iranian
barrels
