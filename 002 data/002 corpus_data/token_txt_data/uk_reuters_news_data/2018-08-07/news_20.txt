wrapup 5-trump says firms doing business in iran to be barred from us as sanctions hit
reuters
companies
doing
business
with
iran
will
be
barred
from
the
united
states
president
donald
trump
said
on
tuesday
as
new
sanctions
took
effect
despite
pleas
from
washington
s
allies
iran
dismissed
a
offer
from
the
trump
administration
for
talks
saying
it
could
not
negotiate
while
washington
had
reneged
on
a
deal
to
lift
sanctions
in
return
for
curbs
on
iran
s
nuclear
programme
trump
decided
this
year
to
pull
out
of
the
agreement
ignoring
pleas
from
the
other
world
powers
that
had
the
deal
including
washington
s
main
european
allies
britain
france
and
germany
as
well
as
russia
and
china
european
countries
hoping
to
persuade
tehran
to
continue
to
respect
the
deal
have
promised
to
try
to
lessen
the
blow
of
sanctions
and
to
urge
their
firms
not
to
pull
out
but
that
has
proven
difficult
european
companies
have
quit
iran
arguing
that
they
can
not
risk
their
business
these
are
the
most
biting
sanctions
ever
imposed
and
in
november
they
ratchet
up
to
yet
another
level
anyone
doing
business
with
iran
will
not
be
doing
business
with
the
united
states
i
am
asking
for
world
peace
nothing
less
trump
tweeted
on
tuesday
iranian
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
criticized
trump
s
tweet
as
a
tired
cliche
and
denounced
us
and
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
a
warmonger
claims
he
is
waging
war
for
world
peace
zarif
tweeted
white
house
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
said
on
monday
iran
s
only
chance
of
escaping
sanctions
would
be
to
take
up
an
offer
to
negotiate
with
trump
for
a
tougher
deal
if
the
ayatollahs
want
to
get
out
from
under
the
squeeze
they
should
come
and
sit
down
the
pressure
will
not
relent
while
the
negotiations
go
on
bolton
one
of
the
administration
s
main
hawks
on
iran
told
fox
news
on
tuesday
bolton
said
the
sanctions
were
already
working
deterring
european
companies
the
european
governments
are
still
holding
to
the
nuclear
deal
but
honestly
their
businesses
are
running
from
it
as
fast
as
they
can
so
that
the
effect
of
the
american
sanctions
really
is
proceeding
few
american
companies
do
much
business
in
iran
so
the
impact
of
sanctions
mainly
stems
from
washington
s
ability
to
block
european
and
asian
firms
from
trading
there
among
large
european
companies
that
have
suspended
plans
to
invest
in
iran
are
france
s
oil
major
total
and
its
big
carmakers
psa
and
renault
we
have
ceased
our
already
restricted
activities
in
iran
in
accordance
with
the
applicable
sanctions
said
german
car
and
truck
manufacturer
daimler
washington
accepts
that
iran
has
complied
with
the
terms
of
the
deal
reached
under
trump
s
predecessor
barack
obama
but
says
the
agreement
is
flawed
because
it
is
not
strict
enough
iran
says
it
will
continue
to
abide
by
the
deal
for
now
if
other
countries
can
help
protect
it
from
the
economic
impact
of
washington
s
decision
to
pull
out
tuesday
s
sanctions
target
iran
s
purchases
of
dollars
metals
trading
coal
industrial
software
and
its
auto
sector
global
oil
prices
rose
on
tuesday
on
concern
sanctions
could
cut
world
supply
although
the
toughest
measures
targeting
iran
s
oil
exports
do
not
take
effect
for
four
more
months
global
benchmark
brent
crude
oil
futures
were
up
or
percent
to
per
barrel
at
gmt
it
is
a
reality
check
that
this
is
happening
and
that
iran
s
oil
exports
will
be
hurt
when
the
oil
sanctions
hit
it
in
november
chief
commodities
analyst
at
commerzbank
bjarne
schieldrop
said
in
a
speech
hours
before
the
sanctions
were
due
to
take
effect
iran
s
president
hassan
rouhani
rejected
negotiations
as
long
as
washington
was
no
longer
complying
with
the
deal
if
you
stab
someone
with
a
knife
and
then
you
say
you
want
talks
then
the
first
thing
you
have
to
do
is
remove
the
knife
rouhani
said
in
a
speech
broadcast
live
on
state
television
we
are
always
in
favour
of
diplomacy
and
talks
but
talks
need
honesty
rouhani
said
iranian
intelligence
minister
mahmoud
alavi
said
trump
s
withdrawal
from
the
deal
meant
there
was
no
point
negotiating
since
washington
had
shown
it
did
not
abide
by
its
commitments
and
iran
based
on
past
experience
has
no
trust
in
negotiating
with
the
american
the
nuclear
deal
is
closely
associated
in
iran
with
rouhani
a
relative
moderate
who
won
two
landslide
elections
on
promises
to
open
up
the
economy
to
the
outside
world
european
countries
fear
that
by
abandoning
it
washington
could
undermine
rouhani
and
strengthen
the
hand
of
his
hardline
opponents
britain
france
germany
and
the
eu
as
a
bloc
said
in
a
joint
statement
on
monday
we
deeply
regret
the
reimposition
of
sanctions
by
the
since
the
sanctions
were
initially
lifted
two
years
ago
iranian
oil
exports
have
risen
but
many
iranians
have
yet
to
see
major
economic
improvement
and
the
prospect
that
washington
would
reimpose
sanctions
has
helped
drive
a
collapse
in
the
value
of
iran
s
currency
this
year
raising
the
cost
of
imports
iran
s
security
forces
have
responded
firmly
to
protests
against
rising
prices
iran
this
week
made
it
easier
to
access
foreign
currency
and
said
it
was
prosecuting
an
bank
official
for
economic
crimes
sanctions
will
definitely
make
daily
life
harder
for
iranians
said
saeed
leylaz
a
economist
and
political
analyst
but
if
the
government
has
a
serious
plan
they
can
control
the
iraq
said
it
did
not
agree
with
the
sanctions
on
its
neighbour
but
will
abide
by
them
to
protect
its
own
interests
as
a
matter
of
principle
we
are
against
sanctions
in
the
region
blockade
and
sanctions
destroy
societies
and
do
not
weaken
regimes

minister
