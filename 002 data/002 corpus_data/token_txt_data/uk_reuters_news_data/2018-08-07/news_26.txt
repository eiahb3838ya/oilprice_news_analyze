country
contain
biodiesel
starting

it

environmentalists
fear
the

indonesian
oil
imports
indonesia
currently
imports
around
barrels
per
day
of
crude
oil
and
a
roughly
similar
amount
of
refined
products
which
makes
southeast
asia
s
largest
economy
vulnerable
to
the
sort
of
increases
in
global
crude
prices
seen
over
the
past
year
with
the
current
account
deficit
estimated
to
grow
by
billion
in
the
plan
is
to
cut
diesel
imports
by
mandating
that
all
diesel
consumers
including
power
plants
and
railways
use
biodiesel
that
contains
percent
typically
palm

officials
estimate
this
will
save

six

the

the

phase
of
adopting
biodiesel
use
he
said
referring
to
fame
s

effect
when
mixed
with

the
