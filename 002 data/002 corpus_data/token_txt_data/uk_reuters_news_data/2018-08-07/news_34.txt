uk government review backs subsidies for mini nuclear plants
london
reuters
britain
should
offer
developers
of
mini
nuclear
plants
subsidies
similar
to
those
made
available
to
the
offshore
wind
industry
an
independent
review
commissioned
by
the
government
said
on
tuesday
britain
needs
to
invest
in
new
power
generating
capacity
to
replace
aging
coal
and
nuclear
plants
that
are
due
to
close
in
the
and
is
seeking
more
low
carbon
options
to
help
meet
its
emission
reduction
targets
the
government
has
been
investigating
whether
mini
nuclear
plans
so
called
small
modular
reactors
smr
could
offer
a
solution
and
whether
the
industry
could
help
boost
much
needed
exports
as
britain
leaves
the
european
union
the
government
should
establish
an
advanced
manufacturing
supply
chain
initiative
as
it
did
with
offshore
wind
to
bring
forward
existing
and
new
manufacturing
capability
said
the
report
by
the
expert
finance
working
group
on
small
nuclear
reactors
government
support
for
offshore
wind
has
enabled
that
industry
to
drive
down
costs
and
reduce
subsidies
the
report
also
said
the
nascent
smr
industry
could
provide
a
boost
for
british
manufacturing
and
exports
there
is
a
real
opportunity
for
the
uk
as
supply
chains
are
yet
to
be
established
for
small
nuclear
projects
unlike
large
nuclear
with
established
supply
chains
largely
outside
the
uk
the
report
said
rolls
royce
which
hopes
to
build
smrs
in
britain
as
part
of
a
consortium
said
the
export
market
could
be
worth
as
much
as
billion
pounds
smrs
use
existing
or
new
nuclear
technology
scaled
down
to
a
fraction
of
the
size
of
larger
plants
and
would
be
able
to
produce
around
a
tenth
of
the
electricity
created
by
projects
the
mini
plants
which
could
be
deployed
by
according
to
the
review
would
be
made
in
factories
with
parts
small
enough
to
be
transported
on
trucks
and
barges
where
they
could
be
assembled
much
more
quickly
than
their
counterparts
britain
s
nuclear
energy
minister
richard
harrington
said
the
government
would
consider
the
review
s
findings
the
review
recognises
the
opportunity
presented
by
small
nuclear
reactors
and
shows
the
potential
for
how
investors
industry
and
government
can
work
together
to
make
small
nuclear
reactors
a
reality
he
said
in
a
statement
has
launched
a
bid
to
build
smrs
as
part
of
a
uk
consortium
with
amec
foster
wheeler
nuvia
arup
and
laing
o
rourke
with
the
nuclear
advanced
manufacturing
research
centre
