is
gaining
momentum
after
a
long
hiatus
in
investments
as
energy
giants
sense
a
widening
supply
gap
within
five
years
spending
on
new
complex
facilities
that
gas
into
liquid
in
order
to
allow
its
transportation
dried
up
following
the
collapse
in

prices
in
appetite
was
further
dampened
by
fears
that
a
plethora
of
lng
plants
built
since
the
late
would
lead
to
a
large
supply
glut
until
early
in
the
next
decade
but
sentiment
has
radically
changed
over
the
past
year
buoyed
by
rising
oil
prices
and
exceptionally
strong
demand
from
rapidly
growing
economies
such
as
china
and

executives
are
increasingly
confident
conditions
are
once
again
ripe

qatar
the

is
preparing

expand
its

around
one

the
glut
that
people
see
i
don
t
see
if
you
just
count
on
being
pessimistic
about
the
market
and
don
t
build
expansions
you
will
never
catch
that
upside
when
the
market
is
up
saad

told

in

the

and
conocophillips
to
help
build
and
fund
the
new
expansion
phases
as
well
as
possibly
new
entrants
he
said
a
major
change
in
the
outlook
happened
after
china
strongly
boosted
imports
of
lng
in
recent
years
to
reduce
coal
burn
in
its
fight
against

the
balance
definitely
looks
more
favourable
towards

the

plummeted

highly
critical

they
have
learnt
from
past
mistakes
the
