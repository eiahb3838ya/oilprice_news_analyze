world
shares
edged
toward
a
high
on
tuesday
as
the
biggest
jump
in
chinese
stocks
for
over
two
years
and
an
upbeat
start
for
europe
followed
wall
street
s
best
close
since
january
the
moves
came
despite
a
host
of
simmering
global
feuds
oil
prices
ticked
higher
as
the
united
states
reimposed
some
sanctions
on
iran
while
the
turkish
lira
bounced
back
almost
percent
from
its
worst
day
in
a
decade
on
monday
that
had
been
prompted
by
a
row
with
washington
the
mood
lifted
overnight
as
chinese
stocks
rebounded
percent
on
hopes
of
fresh
government
spending
following
a
selloff
that
had
knocked
them
down
about
percent
london
paris
and
frankfurt
followed
by
rising
to
percent
as
europe

investors
cheered
results

unicredit
and
oil
firms
and
miners
gained

the
rise
in
crude
prices
the
chinese
have
stabilised
the
yuan
the
lira
hasn
t
been
annihilated
this
morning
so
once
the
sharp
fx
moves
have
calmed
down
and
as
long
as
the
company
earnings
are
good
you
have
a
more

friendly
environment
said
societe
generale
strategist
kit
juckes
currency
markets
remained
volatile
although
less
so
than
in
recent
sessions
as
the
dollar
dipped
the
euro
bounced
to
from
a
near
low
despite
a
second
day
of
disappointing
german
economic
data
while
britain
s
pound
made
back
some
ground
after
brexit
worries
had
pushed
it
to
an
low
turkey
s
lira
recovered
percent
from
monday
s
losses
of
more
than
percent
after
washington
had
moved
to
end
access
to
markets
for
some
turkish
exports
a
report
by
cnn
turk
that
turkish
officials
would
go
to
washington
to
discuss
the
strained
relations
helped
the
rise
although
the
lira
remains
close
to
a
record
low
already
struggling
with
inflation
at
highs
near
percent
and
political
pressure
on
the
central
bank
not
to
raise
interest
rates
the
lira
s
losses
are
nearing
percent
as
jitters
about
foreign
currency
debt
payments
rise
currently
the
impact
of
the
lira
s
slide
is
mostly
contained
within
the
country
but
fears
of
a
default
will
begin
to
increase
if
the
currency
keeps
depreciating
