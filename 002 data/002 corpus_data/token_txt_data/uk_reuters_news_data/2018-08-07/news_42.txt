reuters
czech
power
producer
cez
partly
blamed
exceptional
gains
a
year
ago
for
a
collapse
in
its
net
profit
on
tuesday
and
said
its
business
should
now
start
to
pick
up
as
prices
are
on
the
rise
cez
like
many
european
utilities
has
seen
profit
squeezed
in
recent
years
by
depressed
whole
electricity
prices
the
majority
company
maintained
its
profit
outlook
after
reporting
a
percent
slump
in
adjusted
net
profit
and
its
chief
financial
officer
said
results
should
be
the
bottom
of
the
cycle
much
of
the
earnings
drop
was
due
to
gains
booked
in
the
same
period
a
year
ago
from
the
sale
of
shares
held
in
hungarian
oil
and
gas
group
mol
and
real
estate
in
the
czech
republic
it
said
for
the
full
year
cez
has
forecast
that
adjusted
net
income
would
fall
by
up
to
percent
to
between
billion
crowns
million
and
billion
crowns
we
are
comfortable
with
this
range
so
far
and
we
think
we
should
get
there
chief
financial
officer
martin
novak
told
reporters
cez
also
forecast
ebitda
to
fall
slightly
in
to
billion
to
billion
crowns
down
from
billion
crowns
posted
in
in
the
second
quarter
adjusted
net
income
which
strips
out
extraordinary
items
fell
to
billion
crowns
million
well
below
an
average
estimate
of
billion
crowns
in
a
reuters
poll
of
analysts
quarterly
revenue
slipped
to
billion
crowns
versus
the
average
estimate
of
billion
crowns
in
the
poll
hedging
of
contracts
for
delivery
in
the
second
half
meant
that
rising
spot
power
prices
dented
earnings
before
interest
depreciation
and
amortisation
ebitda
by
billion
crowns
however
same
amount
will
be
compensated
for
in
the
second
half
when
deliveries
will
be
made
at
higher
prices
than
the
hedges
novak
said
the
company
s
strategy
of
expected
output
means
that
rising
market
prices
on
the
back
of
increasing
allowance
prices
will
not
be
seen
in
earnings
until
later
cez
said
it
had
percent
of
its
output
at
an
average
price
of
euros
per
megawatt
hour
up
from
a
previous
average
price
of
euros
last
quarter
when
it
had
sold
already
percent
cez
contracts
percent
of
power
at
an
average
price
of
euro
per
mwh
we
can
clearly
see
that
the
trend
is
turning
our
prices
for
the
coming
years
are
beginning
to
rise
novak
said
we
think
that
this
year
should
be
the
bottom
of
our
czech
crowns
