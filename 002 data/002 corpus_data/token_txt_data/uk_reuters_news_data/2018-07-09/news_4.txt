be
nearly

also
supply

of
the

the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
allies
including
russia
agreed
last
month
to
increase
output

dampen
price
gains
and
offset
global
production
losses
in
countries
including
libya
the
market
has
grown
concerned
that
if
the
saudis
offset
the
losses
from

it
will
use
up
global
spare
capacity
and
leave
markets
more
vulnerable
to
further
or
unexpected
production
declines
