new
york
reuters
california
is
ready
to
work
with
major
automakers
on
revisions
to
greenhouse
gas
emission
vehicle
rules
through
and
sees
a
window
for
a
deal
in
the
coming
months
the
state
s
top
clean
air
regulator
told
reuters
on
monday
air
resources
board
chair
mary
nichols
said
in
an
interview
on
monday
that
agreements
with
the
federal
government
or
automakers
could
be
struck
in
the
coming
months
as
the
state
pursues
its
own
changes
to
fuel
economy
standards
through
if
the
car
companies
want
to
come
and
talk
to
us
they
will
nichols
said
california
s
effort
could
potentially
putting
pressure
on
the
trump
administration
to
back
a
compromise
instead
of
its
own
plans
to
rollback
federal
vehicle
emissions
rules
i
feel
like
there
is
enough
at
stake
here
for
the
auto
industry
that
we
may
be
able
to
get
the
federal
government
to
back
off
on
the
extreme
proposals
that
they
have
made
nichols
said
the
transportation
department
in
may
submitted
a
proposal
to
the
white
house
recommending
freezing
fuel
economy
standards
at
levels
through
and
would
bar
california
from
setting
stricter
standards
than
the
federal
government
that
proposal
developed
in
tandem
with
the
environmental
protection
agency
is
expected
to
be
made
public
as
early
as
next
week
california
has
vowed
to
fight
a
federal
freeze
in
court
which
could
leave
automakers
in
regulatory
limbo
for
years
as
litigation
grinds
through
the
courts
there
is
also
the
possibility
of
this
all
getting
settled
amicably
and
there
is
really
a
window
of
time
to
do
that
nichols
said
she
suggested
the
time
frame
between
august
when
the
state
proposes
changes
to
its
rules
and
sometime
in
september
when
the
federal
government
closes
a
public
comment
period
on
its
proposal
the
current
federal
rules
negotiated
with
automakers
by
former
president
barack
obama
s
administration
in
aimed
to
double
average
fuel
efficiency
to
about
miles
per
gallon
by
and
they
included
significant
annual
increases
in
automaker
requirements
automakers
now
want
changes
citing
lower
gasoline
prices
and
a
shift
in
consumer
preferences
to
larger
vehicles
california
agreed
to
adopt
the
obama
administration
s
fuel
rules
in
but
can
insist
automakers
follow
tougher
rules
if
the
trump
administration
weakens
requirements
nichols
said
nichols
said
california
plans
to
propose
changes
to
its
rules
through
in
and
the
state
may
propose
ways
to
make
it
easier
for
automakers
to
comply
nichols
said
the
state
has
been
at
a
bit
of
an
impasse
with
the
trump
administration
which
has
not
held
substantive
talks
with
california
she
said
california
and
other
states
in
may
filed
suit
to
challenge
the
administration
s
decision
to
reconsider
the
vehicle
efficiency
rules
gloria
bergquist
a
spokesman
for
the
alliance
of
automobile
manufacturers
a
group
representing
general
motors
co
volkswagen
ag
toyota
motor
corp
and
others
said
monday
automakers
believe
one
national
program
is
better
for
our
customers
who
don
t
want
to
face
higher
vehicle
prices
from
redundant
duplicative
government
regulations
so
we
urge
the
federal
government
and
california
to
come
to
an
nichols
said
automakers
should
get
involved
if
they
want
to
strike
a
deal
to
avoid
years
of
litigation
the
based
companies
are
mostly
hiding
under
their
desks
at
the
moment
waiting
for
something
to
happen
nichols
said
federal
regulators
have
declined
to
comment
on
their
proposal
until
it
is
made
public
the
transportation
department
and
environmental
protection
agency
