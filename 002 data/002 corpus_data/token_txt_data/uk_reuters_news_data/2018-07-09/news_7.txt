update 2-europe grid operators act to fix lag, urge solution

europe
s
power
grid
operators
group
said
on
monday
it
had
started
a
compensation
scheme
to
limit
a
frequency
deviation
originating
from
a
power
grid
row
between
serbia
and
its
former
province
kosovo
which
has
again
slowed
some
of
europe
s
clocks
the
european
network
of
transmission
system
operators
for
electricity
grouping
grid
operators
from
countries
said
digital
clocks
across
europe
that
use
mains
frequency
to
keep
time
such
as
those
on
microwaves
and
clock
radios
have
fallen
behind
by
one
minute
due
to
a
drop
in
frequency
on
continental
europe
s
transmission
network
the
body
urged
serbia
and
kosovo
to
quickly
resolve
the
problem
which
earlier
this
year
slowed
those
clocks
by
as
much
as
six
minutes
with
the
warmer
weather
in
europe
power
demand
across
the
continent
could
rise
and
the
frequency
deviation
may
widen
drops
of
frequency
happen
and
solidarity
mechanisms
exist
but
the
issue
is
new
spokeswoman
claire
camus
said
in
an
emailed
response
to
questions
from
reuters
calling
it
a
political
issue
that
demanded
a
political
solution
camus
said
the
compensation
scheme
launched
by
continental
european
transmission
system
operators
would
limit
the
delay
to
below
seconds
if
it
is
proven
that
there
is
deliberate
unwillingness
from
both
parties
to
solve
the
situation
sanctions
can
be
looked
at
but
so
far
there
is
no
such
proof
she
added
to
lessen
the
impact
on
consumers
european
grid
operators
agreed
in
march
to
inject
missing
electricity
into
the
joint
network
and
to
restore
the
frequency
but
the
operators
agreed
they
would
not
tolerate
a
grid
time
deviation
of
more
than
seconds
ems
blamed
kosovo
for
withdrawing
in
an
unauthorised
manner
uncontracted
electricity
from
the
synchronised
european
grid
ems
will
remain
in
contact
with
seeking
a
solution
to
the
problem
ems
said
adding
that
prior
to
any
decision
about
possible
sanctions
all
the
facts
and
responsibility
had
to
established
kosovan
grid
operator
kostt
was
not
available
to
comment
it
aims
to
become
an
member
but
serbia
has
been
obstructing
these
efforts
the
dispute
over
regulatory
issues
and
grid
operation
is
further
complicated
by
belgrade
s
refusal
to
recognise
kosovo
which
seceded
from
serbia
in
some
serbs
in
the
north
of
kosovo
do
not
pay
their
electricity
bills
to
the
kosovo
authorities
their
bills
used
to
be
paid
by
the
rest
of
kosovo
s
population
until
the
country
s
energy
regulator
ended
that
practice
leaving
its
grid
operator
kostt
without
the
financial
means
to
buy
the
energy
needed
to
cover
usage
in
the
north
because
this
energy
is
not
injected
in
the
interconnected
continental
european
system
frequency
drops
slightly
creating
a
grid
time
deviation
the
european
union
is
mediating
in
the
dispute
which
includes
the
implementation
of
the
connection
agreement
between
kostt
and
continental
europe
camus
said
but
the
serbian
authorities
set
as
a
the
creation
of
an
association
of
serb
municipalities
in
kosovo
and
this
is
not
acceptable
to
the
kosovo
authorities
