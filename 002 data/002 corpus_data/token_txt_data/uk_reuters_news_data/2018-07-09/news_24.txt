reuters
south
sudan
rebels
on
monday
rejected
a
peace
plan
to
reinstate
insurgent
leader
riek
machar
as
vice
president
saying
it
failed
to
dilute
the
strong
power
base
of
the
country
s
president
machar
was
president
salva
kiir
s
deputy
until
when
a
political
disagreement
between
them
degenerated
into
a
war
that
has
ravaged
south
sudan
ever
since
the
deal
naming
machar
first
vice
president
was
reached
in
entebbe
in
talks
mediated
by
uganda
s
president
yoweri
museveni
and
that
he
and
kiir
attended
it
was
announced
on
sunday
by
kiir
s
office
but
an
official
of
machar
s
rebel
group
said
on
monday
it
was
not
acceptable
puok
both
baluang
deputy
spokesman
said
the
rebels
should
appoint
two
of
the
four
vice
presidents
envisaged
under
the
entebbe
deal
and
kiir
s
grip
on
power
should
be
loosened
further
we
will
not
fall
only
for
the
position
of
the
first
vice
president
in
this
negotiation
we
are
focusing
more
on
structural
and
institutional
issues
to
constrain
kiir
s
regime
both
in
the
executive
and
legislature
he
said
it
was
not
clear
if
baluang
was
speaking
on
machar
s
behalf
and
the
leader
could
not
immediately
be
contacted
for
comment
is
the
largest
of
the
rebel
groups
fighting
kiir
s
government
and
militants
allied
to
it
control
several
areas
close
to
the
capital
juba
the
agreement
on
machar
s
position
would
have
marked
a
potential
breakthrough
in
new
efforts
mediated
by
regional
leaders
to
end
the
war
which
has
primarily
been
fought
along
ethnic
lines
between
kiir
s
dinka
and
machar
s
nuer
groups
it
has
killed
tens
of
thousands
and
devastated
the
economy
of
africa
s
youngest
nation
a
similar
deal
in
failed
the
following
year
after
machar
returned
to
the
capital
and
disagreements
quickly
developed
reigniting
fighting
on
friday
government
and
opposition
signed
an
agreement
on
security
arrangements
that
followed
on
from
a
ceasefire
deal
last
month
but
the
truce
has
been
frequently
violated
by
both
sides
