indonesia
s
state
owned
energy
holding
company
pertamina
has
decided
not
to
go
ahead
with
what
would
have
been
the
country
s
second
receiving
terminal
for
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
its
chief
executive
said
on
monday
indonesia
has
forecast
sharp
increases
in
gas
demand
after
but
increases
in
domestic
consumption
of
the
fuel
have
been
hampered
by
an
abundance
of
cheap
coal
and
sluggish
development
of
gas
infrastructure
today
we
are
not
going
ahead
because
it
is
not
yet
feasible
to
continue

acting
ceo
nicke
widyawati
told
reporters
referring
to
the
project
that
would
have
been
built
in
bojonegara
not
far
from
jakarta
the
terminal
valued
at
up
to
million
was
to
be
developed
in
a
joint
venture
between
kalla
group
unit
bumi
sarana
migas
and
pertamina
with
financing
from
the
japan
bank
for
international
cooperation
jbic
the
terminal
was
to
be
designed
by
the
engineering
unit
of
tokyo
gas
co
ltd
and
was
expected
to
come
onstream
in
gas
demand
has
declined
so
it
s
not
feasible
from
a
business
standpoint
widyawati
added
noting
that
if
gas
demand
for
power
generation
increased
the
decision
to
halt
the
project
