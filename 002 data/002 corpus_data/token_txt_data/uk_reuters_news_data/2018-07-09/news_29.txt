new

reuters
starbucks
corp
said
on
monday
it
will
begin
phasing
out
use
of
plastic
straws
at
its
restaurants
by
giving
environmentalists
a
sizeable
victory
in
their
campaign
to
convince
restaurants
to
abandon
plastic
utensils
the
chain
said
it
would
eliminate
plastic
straws
globally
at
its
locations
the
straws
will
be
replaced
by
new
recyclable
strawless
lids
and
alternative
material
straws
its
announcement
came
just
days
after
its
hometown
of
seattle
barred
plastic
straws
and
utensils
at
restaurants
amid
a
broader
global
push
to
discourage
the
use
of
plastic
straws
and
other
use
plastics
for
our
partners
and
customers
this
is
a
significant
milestone
to
achieve
our
global
aspiration
of
sustainable
coffee
served
to
our
customers
in
more
sustainable
ways
starbucks
chief
executive
kevin
johnson
said
in
a
statement
last
month
rival
mcdonald
s
corp
the
world
s
largest
restaurant
chain
announced
plans
to
transition
to
paper
straws
at
its
uk
and
ireland
restaurants
beginning
in
september
with
completion
in
the
mcdonald
s
decision
does
not
extend
to
its
other
global
restaurants
however
a
proposal
to
investigate
the
impact
of
plastic
straws
at
its
worldwide
restaurants
what
would
have
been
a
step
towards
phasing
out
plastic
straws
was
shot
down
by
shareholders
in
may
the
environment
programme
estimates
that
some
million
tons
of
plastic
is
dumped
into
the
ocean
every
year
the
equivalent
of
dumping
a
garbage
truck
full
of
plastic
every
minute
killing
birds
and
marine
life
and
compromising
the
ocean
ecosystem
plastic
straws
represent
a
comparatively
small
amount
of
all
plastic
waste
however
they
are
more
difficult
to
recycle
than
other
plastic
items
dylan
de
thomas
vice
president
of
industry
collaboration
at
the
recycling
partnership
said
that
curbside
recycling
programs
in
the
united
states
don
t
typically
accept
straws
even
for
those
consumers
who
recycle
plastic
items
a
straw
is
so
small
it
can
be
difficult
to
sort
it
s
really
thin
it
s
really
small
it
s
really
light
so
it
s
really
challenging
in
our
existing
sortation
system
to
be
able
to
sort
it
out
he
said
in
contrast
paper
straws
are
often
compostable
when
disposed
of
in
a
landfill
paper
straws
decompose
at
a
much
faster
rate
than
plastic
ones
for
businesses
paper
straws
are
also
more
expensive
than
their
plastic
counterparts
per
straws
at
catering
equipment
company
drinkstuff
paper
straws
cost
about
versus
for
plastic
for
instance
in
there
were
about
billion
straws
used
in
the
united
states
per
year
around
million
straws
per
day
according
to
data
provided
by
technomic
taken
in
isolation
i
don
t
know
that
anyone
would
argue
that
slightly
higher
straw
costs
are
going
to
break
the
backs
of
restaurant
owners
said
david
henkes
senior
principal
at
technomic
food
service
consulting
company
but
you
couple
it
with
rising
costs
in
a
whole
lot
of
other
categories
and
that
s
where
the
challenge
comes
it
s
a
small
increase
here
and
a
small
increase
grassroots
conservation
groups
have
been
among
the
most
vocal
opponents
of
plastic
straws
though
the
push
to
paper
and
other
biodegradable
and
recyclable
materials
has
found
support
in
some
corporate
boardrooms
as
well
earlier
this
year
the
carrier
alaska
airlines
said
it
would
be
going
strawless
beginning
this
month
there
s
always
going
to
be
people
who
still
buy
plastic
straws

head
of
marketing
buzz
seager
said
in
a
phone
interview
especially
if
you
re
a
little
venue
prices
are
always
going
to
be
a
bit
of
a
barrier
to
yet
seager
said
the
company
has
seen
an
increase
in
demand
from
customers
for
straws
that
are
better
for
the
environment
you
basically
just
pay
for
the
privilege
of
being
