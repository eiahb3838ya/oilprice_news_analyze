said
on
monday
its
syncrude
oil
sands
project
in
western
canada
will
resume
some
production
in
july
sooner
than
expected
and
hit
full
capacity
in
september
following
an
outage
last
month
that
disrupted
total
output
the
disruption
at
syncrude
representing
percent
of
canadian
oil
production
has
tightened
canadian
supplies
and
reduced

crude

suncor
the
biggest
stakeholder
in
the
northern
alberta
project
said
an
early
investigation
showed
the
cause
of
disruption
was
a
transformer
trip
syncrude
can
produce
up
to
barrels
per
day
of
crude
oil
and
had
been
expected
to
remain
down
through
july
but
suncor
said
one
of
its
coker
drums
which
produces
about
bpd
would
return
to
service
during
the
second
half
of
july
a
second
one
which
has
an
output
of
about
bpd
is
expected
to
return
to
service
in
the
first
half

august

from

to
be
about
percent
to

select
wcs
heavy
crude
trades
at
a
discount
to
west
texas
intermediate
light
oil
wti
the
north
american
benchmark
in
part
because
of
difficulties
transporting
crude
through
clogged
pipelines
from
alberta
to
refineries
traders
reduced
that
discount
for
three
consecutive
days
last
week
as
haywood
securities
research
predicted
a
longer
schedule
that
would
ease

the

was

on

according

the

translates

altacorp
analysts
wrote
in
a
note
we
view
the
update
as
slightly
negative
as
the
project
is
expected
to
return
to
normal

after
the
acceleration
of

resulting
