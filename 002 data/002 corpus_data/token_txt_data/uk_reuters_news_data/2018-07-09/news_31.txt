shanghai
reuters
all
of
china
s
major
polluters
will
need
to
install
emissions
monitoring
systems
before
the
end
of
the
year
according
to
a
report
submitted
to
parliament
on
monday
as
the
country
tries
to
improve
surveillance
and
bring
lawbreaking
firms
into
line
china
is
now
in
the
fifth
year
of
its
war
on
pollution
and
president
xi
jinping
said
in
may
that
the
country
would
use
the
full
might
of
the
ruling
communist
party
to
fix
the
damage
done
by
four
decades
of
untrammeled
economic
growth
according
to
the
national
people
s
congress
npc
report
published
by
state
news
agency
xinhua
china
s
central
government
has
already
spent
billion
yuan
billion
to
improve
air
quality
over
the
to
period
but
some
regions
are
still
way
behind
when
it
comes
to
monitoring
and
cracking
down
on
pollution
it
said
and
china
will
work
to
create
a
comprehensive
nationwide
monitoring
system
by
the
end
of
the
decade
extending
full
coverage
to
cities
in
the
country
s
central
and
western
regions
though
china
has
tried
to
create
a
national
surveillance
system
that
would
enable
regulators
to
identify
violations
in
real
time
monitoring
standards
and
compliance
levels
have
so
far
been
uneven
during
a
nationwide
inspection
program
completed
last
year
the
central
government
uncovered
thousands
of
violations
throughout
china
s
provinces
and
regions
and
according
to
recent
reviews
many
of
the
problems
still
have
not
been
properly
rectified
the
report
to
parliament
also
promised
that
all
households
in
the
and
regions
would
make
the
switch
from
coal
to
natural
gas
heating
by
as
part
of
efforts
to
curb
smog
china
already
converted
more
than
million
households
and
enterprises
from
coal
to
gas
over
the
to
period
but
the
acceleration
of
the
program
last
year
led
to
severe
fuel
shortages
across
the
northern
regions
during
the
winter
china
also
installed
emissions
technology
on
more
than
gigawatts
of
power
capacity
in
the
last
five
years
equal
to
percent
of
the
country
s
total
power
capacity
it
also
eliminated
more
than
million
substandard
vehicles
from
its
roads
over
the
period
