the
united
states
wants
to
eliminate
all
iran
s
crude
oil
exports
from
november
and
is
relying
on
saudi
arabia
and
other
opec
and
members
to
fill
the
gap
in
supplies
our
goal
is
to
increase
pressure
on
the
iranian
regime
by
reducing
to
zero
its
revenue
from
crude
oil
sales
a
senior
state
department
official
told
a
news
briefing
this
month
we
are
working
to
minimise
disruptions
to
the
global
market
but
we
are
confident
that
there
is
sufficient
global
spare
oil
production
capacity
brian
hook
the
director
of
policy
planning
said
on
july
we
are
not
looking
to
grant
licences
or
waivers
broadly
on
the
of
sanctions
because
we
believe
pressure
is
critical
to
achieve
our
national
security
but
if
the
united
states
succeeds
in
reducing
iran
s
crude
exports
close
to
zero
from
november
in
line
with
its
stated
policy
saudi
arabia
would
have
to
raise
its
production
to
unprecedented
levels
to
cover
the
loss
and
it
would
leave
the
global
market
tighter
than
at
any
time
since
the
oil
shocks
of
and
with
resulting
upward
pressure
on
prices
the
administration
has
not
been
clear
about
whether
sanctions
will
apply
just
to
crude
or
will
include
condensates
briefing
with
an
iran
diplomacy
update
state
department
july
but
assuming
sanctions
apply
only
to
crude
the
global
market
would
still
need
to
replace
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
iranian
exports
from
the
start
of
november
according
to
the
latest
information
from
the
joint
organisations
data
initiative
jodi
iran
exported
between
million
and
million
bpd
of
crude
between
january
and
april
the
question
is
where
will
the
replacement
barrels
come
from
the
international
energy
agency
estimates
opec
members
held
million
bpd
of
spare
capacity
at
the
end
of
may
while
their
allies
had
no
more
than
bpd
oil
market
report
iea
june
saudi
arabia
accounted
for
almost
of
the
reported
opec
spare
capacity
million
bpd
with
smaller
volumes
held
by
iraq
bpd
united
arab
emirates
bpd
and
kuwait
bpd
russia
accounted
for
most
of
the
spare
capacity
roughly
bpd
with
little
or
no
available
spare
capacity
in
the
other
allies
other
agencies
and
market
analysts
put
the
spare
capacity
figures
for
opec
and
members
significantly
lower
than
the
iea
which
implies
the
market
is
even
tighter
but
using
the
iea
s
figures
it
is
clear
saudi
arabia
would
have
to
replace
most
of
the
iranian
barrels
lost
as
a
result
of
sanctions
the
kingdom
would
need
to
increase
production
and
exports
by
at
least
million
bpd
to
cover
the
total
loss
of
iranian
barrels
the
required
increase
would
be
even
higher
if
other
opec
and
countries
struggle
to
raise
their
output
or
more
production
is
lost
as
a
result
of
problems
in
venezuela
and
libya
in
theory
there
is
sufficient
spare
capacity
in
saudi
arabia
and
other
countries
but
it
would
leave
the
global
market
with
less
than
million
bpd
of
capacity
left
to
meet
all
other
contingencies
in
practice
some
analysts
think
the
market
could
be
much
tighter
with
sanctions
essentially
using
up
all
the
spare
capacity
worldwide
the
iea
estimates
saudi
arabia
could
raise
production
to
just
over
million
bpd
and
sustain
it
at
that
level
for
an
extended
period
saudi
arabia
has
already
used
some
of
its
spare
capacity
to
increase
production
by
bpd
from
million
bpd
in
may
to
million
bpd
in
june
the
figures
were
contained
in
a
communication
from
the
kingdom
to
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
saudi
arabia
raised
oil
output
by
around
bpd
in
june
reuters
july
but
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
the
kingdom
has
not
produced
more
than
million
bpd
on
an
annual
basis
or
million
bpd
in
a
single
month
july
in
the
last
years
saudi
arabia
has
reported
roughly
similar
production
numbers
to
jodi
with
output
peaking
at
million
bpd
in
november
it
is
possible
the
kingdom
could
lift
production
by
another
million
bpd
beyond
anything
it
has
ever
produced
before
but
at
the
moment
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
for
certain
some
observers
question
whether
such
high
rates
of
production
could
be
implemented
quickly
and
sustained
for
any
length
of
time
maximum
production
would
require
opening
the
chokes
on
existing
wells
and
bringing
previously
wells
back
into
service
boosting
production
this
way
might
risk
a
decline
in
oilfield
pressure
that
could
result
in
damage
to
the
reservoirs
some
spare
capacity
might
require
drilling
new
wells
within
existing
fields
in
which
case
it
is
not
strictly
speaking
spare
capacity
at
all
and
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
pipelines
processing
plants
and
export
terminals
have
enough
capacity
to
handle
million
bpd
because
such
high
flow
rates
have
never
been
tested
saudi
arabia
could
boost
volumes
supplied
to
the
market
by
releasing
some
of
its
domestic
crude
stocks
as
well
as
raising
field
production
but
stock
releases
would
only
ever
be
a
measure
domestic
crude
stocks
have
already
fallen
by
million
barrels
since
their
peak
in
october
according
to
government
data
submitted
to
the
jodi
domestic
stocks
had
been
drawn
down
to
million
barrels
at
the
end
of
april
the
lowest
level
since
november
most
of
the
remaining
inventories
are
required
for
operational
reasons
including
as
feedstock
for
the
country
s
growing
refinery
capacity
as
well
as
ensuring
smooth
flow
of
oil
from
the
fields
onto
tankers
if
saudi
arabia
needs
to
replace
iranian
barrels
most
of
the
increase
will
have
to
come
from
more
pumping
rather
than
stock
releases
and
it
would
require
producing
more
oil
than
saudi
arabia
has
ever
pumped
before
stringent
sanctions
on
iran
will
take
both
saudi
arabia
and
the
oil
market
into
the
unknown
