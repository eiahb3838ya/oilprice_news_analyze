global
shares
hit
a
high
on
monday
as
favourable

data
whetted
risk
appetites
while
sterling
brushed
off
the
resignation
of
two
ministers
over
britain
s
departure
from
the
european
union
as
traders
focused
on
the
likelihood
of
a
soft
brexit
the

while
the

was
up

led
by
a
strong
rise
across
mining

the
pound
regained
ground
after
an
earlier
wobble
after

broke
that
brexit
secretary
david

had
resigned

the

came
just
two
days
after
a
meeting
at
may

chequers
country
residence
supposedly
sealed
a
cabinet
deal
on

the

generally
ian
williams
economics
strategy
research
analyst
at
peel
hunt
said
the
uk
is
quite
defensive
so
in
trade
war
times
when
industrials
and
tech
are
getting
clobbered
that
s
not
so
much
of
problem
for
the
uk
because
those
sectors
are
not
as
big
in
weighting
terms
as
they
are
for
the
euro
zone
or
the
added
williams
more
broadly
sentiment
across
markets
was
mostly
positive
after
friday
s
payrolls
report
showed
tame
wages
and
more
people
looking
for
work
the
combination
of
rising
employment
and
increased
labour
force
participation
suggests
healthy
but
not
tightening
labour
market
conditions
in
june
something
that
will
allow
the
fed
to
continue
to
hike
rates
at
a
gradual
pace
said
kevin
cummins
a
senior
economist
at
rbs
the
balanced

helped
japan
nikkei

index
of

climbed
percent
on
top
of

rally
on
friday
when
the
launch
of
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
came
and
went
without
too
many
fireworks
in
currency
markets
the
dollar
was
mostly
softer
following
the
jobs
report
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
had
pulled
back
to
from
a
top
of

friday
the
euro
held
its
gains
at
while
the
dollar
was
flat
on
the
yen
at
global
stocks
were
under
pressure
in
june
as
uncertainty
over
trade
dented
risk
appetite
our
central
expectation
is
that
these
skirmishes
do
not
escalate
into
a
full
trade
war
karen
ward
chief
market
strategist
for
emea
at
morgan
asset
management
said
however
attention
has
shifted
to
the
strong
economic
backdrop
and
the
upcoming
earnings
season
while
trade
tensions
fan
concerns
about
the
future
incoming
data
show
a
soaring
economy
a
healthy
labour
market
and
some
rebound
in
europe
and
japan

support

to
attract
more
foreign

the
focus
this

would
be
on

covering
inflation
