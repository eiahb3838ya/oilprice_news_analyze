nils
mathis
sara
is
often
busy
explaining
to
people
how
a
planned
copper
mine
threatens
his
livelihood
along
with
other
sami
herders
and
fishermen
the
is
in
a
standoff
with
the
mine
owners
norwegian
officials
and
many
townspeople
that
is
after
six
years
coming
to
a
head
it
is
a
litmus
test
for
the
arctic
where
climate
change
and
technology
are
enabling
mineral
and
energy
extraction
shipping
and
tourism
while
threatening
traditional
ways
of
life
and
creating
tensions
among
its
four
million
inhabitants
this
mine
is
completely
nuts
said
sara
preparing
to
move
his
herd
from
winter
pastures
on
norway
s
windswept
finnmark
plateau
three
days
north
to
the
pastures
on
the
coast
where
females
calve
and
there
are
fewer
mosquitoes
we
would
be
losing
summer
pastures
for
our
reindeer
herders
around
the
arctic
in
other
nordic
nations
russia
canada
and
alaska
echoed
his
concerns
in
interviews
citing
threats
from
climate
change
mining
oil
spills
and
poaching
as
well
as
thoughtless
behaviour
from
townspeople
and
tourists
global
majors
including
eni
equinor
gazprom
glencore
lukoil
and
rio
tinto
are
all
grappling
with
how
to
square
their
prospecting
plans
with
the
interests
of
people
whose
views
count
more
than
in
the
past
anders
oskal
executive
director
of
the
international
centre
for
reindeer
husbandry
said
the
copper
mine
was
in
the
spotlight
big

sitting
on
the
fence
and
seeing
how
it
plays
out

local

for
the
nussir
copper
project
back
in
on
the
grounds
it
would
bring
in
jobs
and
funds
it
has
been
stuck
ever
since
indigenous
sami
herders
and
fishermen
say
the
plan
to
dump
the
mine
s
tailings
in
the
fjord
while
less
damaging
than
piling
them
on
land
would
destroy
spawning
grounds
for
cod
and
the
mine
would
damage
summer
pasture
grounds
and
frighten
the
reindeer
i
don
t
get
it
tommy
pettersen
a
sami
fisherman
said
on
board
his
boat
which
gives
him
a
potentially
lucrative
but
unpredictable
income
we
are
a
maritime
nation
we
have
relied
on
the
ocean
to
live
off
and
we
want
to
dump
this
stuff
in
the
fjord

last

he
earned

from

is

he
gets
up
to
norwegian

a

for
his
meat
crowns
for
each

and
crowns
a

for

sells

nussir
has
won
the
necessary

says
the
area
contains
million

of
copper
norway
s
largest
reserve
and
plans
more
than

million
in

we
can
run
this
mine
alongside
reindeer
herding
and
fishing
said
oeystein
rushfeldt
the
head
of
the
project
terje
wickstroem
mayor
of
kvalsund
a
village
of
painted
wooden
houses
on
the
repparfjord
with
inhabitants
said
the
mine
would
boost
a
municipality
which
spends
percent
of
its
income
caring
for
the
elderly
as
young
people
move
away
it
would
create
optimism
for
the
town
said
wickstroem
who
is
himself
a
sami
after
years
of
back
and
forth
with
locals
and
the
consultative
sami
parliament
of
norway
as
well
as
assessments
by
ministries
and
government
agencies
the
government
will
make
a
ruling
on
the
copper
mine
this
year
oskal
of
the
reindeer
husbandry
centre
said
it
was
ironic
that
nussir
may
be
allowed
to
dump
waste
when
norwegian
laws
oblige
sami
reindeer
herders
to
send
the
animals
stomachs
and
intestines
for
destruction
sometimes
hundreds
of
kilometres
away
to
reduce
risks
of
disease
traditionally
herders
just
buried
the
remains
the
sami
herders
insist
they
are
not
opposed
to
change
their
language
has
no
word
for
stability
but
sara
said
the
politicians
were
not
listening
if
this
mine
gets
the
go
ahead
we
will
go
to
the
courts
to
stop
it
he
said
wickstroem
said
he
understood
sara
s
concerns
his
business
is
under
pressure
but
this
is
a
bigger
national
it
is
also
an
international
one
average
temperatures
in
the
arctic
region
have
risen
more
than
degrees
celsius
since
times
twice
as
fast
as
the
world
average
according
to
research
for
the
intergovernmental
arctic
council
temperatures
now
sometimes
spike
above
freezing
in
melting
snow
that
then
into
a
blanket
of
ice
on
lichen

that
the
reindeer
can
not
nuzzle

shrinking

now
travel

and
east
to

in

from
the

in
northern
russia
where
gazprom
is
the
dominant
producer
there
is
an
explosion
of
industrial
development
in

regions
said
mikhail
pogodaev
chair
of
the
association
of
world
reindeer
herders
who
is
based
in
yakutsk
eastern
russia
the
nenets
herders
on
the
yamal
peninsula
still
live
in
tents
and
travel
with
their
herds
unlike
the
sami
who
now
venture
out
on
snowmobiles
or
quad
bikes
from
village
homes
and
overnight
in
caravans
or
wooden
huts
on
skis
russia
does
not
have
norway
s
consultative
system
its
regional
governors
are
often
swapped
by
the
kremlin
making
things
easier
for
companies
able
to
navigate
kremlin
politics
but
leaving
the
nenets
little
power
wealth
or
legal
redress
gazprom
says
it
goes
out
of
its
way
to
cooperate
with
herders
raising
pipelines
to
let
reindeer
pass
underneath
and
making
road
crossings
where
herders
request
them
around
reindeer
cross
via
these
crossing
points
during
a
season
it
said
by
email
oskal
pogodaev
and
some
academics
say
gazprom
does
plan
carefully
but
like
all
energy
majors
it
is
in
the
environmental
firing
line
over
its
impact
on
global
warming
which
is
speeding
up
as
the
polar
ice
caps
melt
in
norway
some
reindeer
herders
and
fishermen
noted
efforts
by
italian
oil
group
eni
to
cooperate
for
instance
using
sami
interpreters
and
discussing
the
sitting
of
an
electric
cable
that
takes
power
to
the
goliat
oilfield
offshore
norwegian
equinor
formerly
statoil
operates
the
offshore
gas
field
snoehvit
in
norway
s
barents
sea
sending
gas
to
a
liquefied
natural
gas
plant
near
the
northern
town
of
hammerfest
the
government
is
offering
exploration
licences
ever
further
north
in
areas
covered
by
winter
sea
ice
until
recent
decades
some
reindeer
herders
see
the
influx
of
workers
as
a
potential
new
market
for
their
meat
but
say
companies
rarely
buy
enough
a
declaration
on
the
rights
of
indigenous
peoples
obliges
states
to
obtain
their
free
and
informed
consent
prior
to
the
approval
of
any
project
affecting
their
lands
in
practice
that
usually
stops
short
of
a
veto
and
lawsuits
abound
in
neighbouring
sweden
the
government
has
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
to
resolve
a
dispute
over
management
of
hunting
and
fishing
rights
in
the
sami
village
of
girjas
and
there
is
a
conflict
over
the
kallak
magnetite
iron
ore
deposit
near
jokkmokk
in
norrbotten
county
where
british
miner
beowulf
mining
is
pursuing
an
exploitation
concession
for
the
kallak
north
project
the
swedish
government
has
not
yet
taken
a
final
decision
in
finland
opposition
from
sami
people
and
environmentalists
has
blocked
proposed
geological
surveys
for
iron
ore
copper
and
gold
in
the
sami
region
of
enontekio
it
is
not
only
herders
and
companies
that
are
facing
off
conflicts
of
interest
between
those
continuing
traditions
and
other
residents
and
visitors
are
increasing
across
the
arctic
from
norway
in
canada
lloyd
binder
said
his
reindeer
herd
at
inuvik
the
country
s
biggest
had
suffered
poaching
since
a
new
highway
opened
to
cars
in
november
bruce
davis
of
the
midnite
sun
reindeer
ranch
in
alaska
says
he
has
just
reindeer
left
from
a
herd
of
in
his
father
s
day
it
was
partly
because
many
had
mixed
with
wild
caribou
but
damage
by
past
gold
prospectors
and
climate
change
had
also
taken
their
toll
on
the
reindeer
s
pastures
still
some
reindeer
find
ways
around
their
problems
in
norway
s
hammerfest
a
long
wooden
fence
built
a
decade
ago
with
money
from
equinor
has
a
gaping
hole
the
reindeer
are
annoying
they
eat
all
the
flowers
