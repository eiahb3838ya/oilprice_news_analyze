serbia could face penalty after row with kosovo slows europe's clocks again
sarajevo

reuters
european
power
grid
lobby
warned
on
monday
it
could
suspend
serbia
unless
it
quickly
resolves
a
dispute
with
its
former
province
kosovo
which
has
again
made
some
digital
clocks
on
the
continent
run
slow
the
european
network
of
transmission
system
operators
for
electricity
which
groups
grid
operators
from
countries
said
that
digital
clocks
across
europe
that
use
mains
frequency
to
keep
time
such
as
those
on
microwaves
and
clock
radios
have
fallen
behind
by
one
minute
due
to
a
drop
in
frequency
on
continental
europe
s
transmission
network
earlier
this
year
a
power
shortfall
in
kosovo
which
serbian
grid
operator
ems
failed
to
compensate
for
slowed
those
clocks
by
as
much
as
six
minutes
with
the
warmer
weather
in
europe
power
demand
across
the
continent
could
rise
and
the
frequency
deviation
may
widen
drops
of
frequency
happen
and
solidarity
mechanisms
exist
but
the
issue
is
new
spokeswoman
claire
camus
said
in
an
emailed
response
to
questions
from
reuters
calling
it
a
political
issue
that
demanded
a
political
solution
can
look
at
possibilities
to
suspend
ems
membership
she
said
to
lessen
the
impact
on
consumers
european
grid
operators
agreed
in
march
to
inject
missing
electricity
into
the
joint
network
and
to
restore
the
frequency
the
compensation
scheme
is
still
ongoing
but
the
operators
agreed
that
they
would
not
tolerate
a
grid
time
deviation
of
more
than
seconds
camus
told
reuters
the
serbian
and
kosovan
grid
operators
were
not
immediately
available
to
comment
kosovo
s
kostt
has
applied
for
membership
of
but
serbia
has
been
obstructing
the
application
the
dispute
over
regulatory
issues
and
grid
operation
is
further
complicated
by
the
fact
that
belgrade
does
not
recognise
kosovo
which
seceded
from
serbia
in
some
serbs
in
the
north
of
kosovo
do
not
pay
their
electricity
bills
to
the
kosovo
authorities
their
bills
used
to
be
paid
by
the
rest
of
kosovo
s
people
until
kosovo
s
energy
regulator
ended
that
practice
leaving
its
grid
operator
kostt
without
the
financial
means
to
buy
the
energy
needed
to
cover
usage
in
the
north
because
this
energy
is
not
injected
in
the
interconnected
continental
european
system
frequency
drops
slightly
creating
a
grid
time
deviation
the
european
union
is
mediating
in
the
dispute
which
includes
the
implementation
of
the
connection
agreement
between
kostt
and
continental
europe
camus
said
but
the
serbian
authorities
set
as
a
the
creation
of
an
association
of
serb
municipalities
in
kosovo
and
this
is
not
acceptable
to
the
kosovo
authorities
