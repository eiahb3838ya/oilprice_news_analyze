aramco
is
more
resilient
to
oil
price
slumps
than
its
biggest
listed
rivals
its
accounts
indicate
giving
a
rare
insight
into
the
state
energy
giant
s
finances
ahead
of
a
proposed
flotation
the
accounts
not
publicly
available
but
seen
by

show
aramco
s
net
income
fell
by
about
percent
to
billion
in
when
oil
prices
collapsed
to
a
low
of
a

due
to
a

saudi
aramco
said
in
response
to
a
request
for
comment
saudi
aramco
does
not
comment
on
speculation
regarding
its
financial
performance
and
fiscal
industry
experts
say
aramco
s
ability
to
better
weather
price
shocks
is
down
to
low
production
costs
the
fact
its
major
operations
are
concentrated
in
just
one
country
and
because
it
has
fewer
employees
than
its
biggest
rivals
even
though
it
is
the
world
s
largest
oil
producer
analysts
estimates
the
saudi
giant
s
production
costs
at
below
per
barrel
compared
to
per
barrel
in
places
like
russia
and
as
much
as
per
barrel
in
locations
like
the
north
sea
the
accounts
show
people
worked
for
aramco
in
that
compares
with
at
exxon
and
at
shell
aramco
produces
around
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
oil
compared
with
exxon
s
and
shell
s
oil
equivalent
of
million
bpd
and
million
bpd
respectively
in
april
bloomberg
reported
aramco
had
net
income
of
billion
in
the
first
six
months
of
up
from
billion
in
the
first
of
half
of
as
oil
prices
spiked
and
as
the
saudi
government
changed
the
tax
rate
results
for
and
have
never
been
disclosed
before
aramco
s
earnings
and
other
key
information
about
the
company
which
pumps
about
percent
of
the
world
s
oil
have
been
a
closely
guarded
secret
for
decades
the
accounts
provide
a
window
into
its
finances
ahead
of
the
proposed
stock
market
listing
should
it
go
ahead
even
though
aramco
may
be
bigger
and
more
resilient
than
its
peers
analysts
have
repeatedly
expressed
doubt
that
it
can
achieve
riyadh
s
trillion
valuation
if
and
when
it
decides
to
list
its
stock
its
nearest
rival
exxon
is
worth
billion
a
listing
of
up
to
percent
of
aramco
has
been
the
centerpiece
of
a
government
plan
to
diversify
the
kingdom
s
economy
but
some
sources
close
to
the
process
say
the
plans
for
a
domestic
and
international
listing
may
never
happen
domestic
is
more
likely
but
the
whole
thing
is
uncertain
said
a
source
familiar
with
aramco
s
ipo
plans
saudi
arabia
s
energy
minister
khalid
said
on
june
it
would
be
nice
to
see
aramco
floated
in
adding
the
timing
was
not
critical
to
the
government
the
documents
seen
by
reuters
show
that
aramco
made
more
money
than
any
other
oil
company
in
its
net
income
of
billion
in
outstripped
exxon
s
billion
while
shell
reported
earnings
attributable
to
shareholders
the

metric
of
billion
bp
dealing
with
the
financial
aftermath
of
the

disaster
reported
a
loss
of
million

better
than
a

loss
in
based
on
cash
flow
from
operations
another
important
metric
for
investors
aramco
did
well
too
the
company

cash
from
operating
activities
rose
about
