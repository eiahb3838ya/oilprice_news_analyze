washington
imposed
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
imports
on
friday
and
beijing
has
said
it
will
retaliate
with
punitive
measures
on
products
worth
a
similar
amount
including
soybeans
pork
and
cotton
the
chinese
government
had
not
officially
confirmed
on
friday
afternoon
that
the
retaliatory
tariffs
had
taken
effect
but
the
measures
have
escalated
the
trade
dispute
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
and
the
world
s
commodities
markets
are
increasingly
embroiled
in
the
the
higher
tariffs
went
into
effect
just
after
noon
in
beijing
gmt
the
and
china
have
also
issued
a
second
batch
of
proposed
duties
on
billion
of
each
other
s
goods
these
would
hit
energy
exports
such
as
coal
and
crude
oil
among
other
areas
it
is
unclear
when
these
will
come
into
effect
below
is
a
detailed
breakdown
of
the
markets
affected
by
the
tariffs
imposed
and
proposed
beijing
s
tariffs
will
have
the
biggest
impact
on
soybeans
the
united
states
top
agricultural
export
to
china
in
worth
about
billion
hurting
farmers
in
states
such
as
iowa
and
texas
which
backed
republican
president
donald
trump
in
the
election
buying
interest
in
beans
from
china
the
world
s
top
importer
of
the
oilseed
has
slowed
to
a
trickle
ahead
of
the
tariffs
with
one
remaining
cargo
heading
for
china

was
due
to
arrive
in
the
port
of
dalian
at
gmt
on
friday
just
hours
after
the
duties
went
into
effect
some
shipments
marked
for
china
were
due
to
be
loaded
from
the
pacific
northwest
and
are
likely
to
get
sent
elsewhere
as
exporters
scramble
to
avoid
paying
the
tariff
a
trader
said
in
the
months
ahead
though
china
will
struggle
to
replace
the
beans
forcing
processors
which
crush
the
beans
to
make
oil
and
animal
feed
to
pay
the
extra
duty
or
find
substitutes
rabobank
reckons
china
may
have
to
buy
up
to
million
tonnes
of
beans
at
tariff
prices
crushers
may
not
pass
on
the
inflated
cost
at
least
in
the
short
term
further
eroding
their
already
low
margins
the
bank
said
in
a
research
note
the
biggest
impact
will
likely
be
seen
in
sales
of
the
next
crop
which
will
come
to
market
in
september
in
the
meantime
brazil
the
world
s
top
exporter
will
likely
pick
up
the
slack
although
a
trade
association
warned
on
thursday
the
south
american
country
may
need
to
import
the
oilseed
from
the
united
states
this
year
to
satisfy
demand
from
local
processors
pork
was
already
saddled
with
duties
enacted
in
an
earlier
round
of
the
trade
row
and
now
faces
an
extra
percent
tariff
that
would
raise
the
total
charges
up
to
percent
european
pork
will
gain
some
ground
over
the
which
shipped
almost
million
worth
of
pork
to
china
last
year
shipments
have
nearly
ground
to
a
halt
since
the
percent
tariffs
implemented
on
april
a
record
volume
of
crude
oil
is
heading
to
china
even
as
beijing
s
planned
tariffs
threaten
to
cut
off
a
relatively
new
and
burgeoning
business
for
exporters
nine
vessels
with
million
barrels
of
crude
oil
loaded
in
texas
and
alaska
and
worth
about
billion
are
due
to
land
over
the
next
five
weeks
thomson

trade
flow
data
shows
that
equates
to
barrels
per
day
percent
of
china
s
daily
imports
and
a
large
volume
for
the
united
states
a
newcomer
to
the
chinese
market
if
enacted
the
import
duty
would
make
oil
less
competitive
than
other
crudes
likely
causing
a
decline
in
chinese
purchases
and
forcing
oil
firms
to
find
other
buyers
amid
a
relatively
global
oil
market
energy
consultancy

mackenzie
said
the
united
states
would
find
it
hard
to
find
an
alternative
market
that
is
as
big
as
china
as
chinese
buyers
make
up
percent
of
overseas
crude
sales
china
would
likely
replace
the
lost
barrels
from
their
top
sellers
russia
or
saudi
arabia
which
have
recently
announced
plans
to
raise
output
among
other
energy
products
china
noticeably
spared
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
exports
from
potential
import
tariffs
but
in
doing
so
it
has
preserved
a
potential
weapon
should
the
trade
war
with
washington
deepen
however
coal
could
be
caught
in
the
crossfire
if
the
second
batch
of
duties
are
introduced
replacing
american
shipments
with
coal
from
other
places
would
not
be
difficult
for
china
but
a
loss
of
business
with
the
world
s
top
importer
of
the
fuel
would
hurt
companies
in
west
virginia
a
state
that
heavily
favoured

in
the
presidential
election
