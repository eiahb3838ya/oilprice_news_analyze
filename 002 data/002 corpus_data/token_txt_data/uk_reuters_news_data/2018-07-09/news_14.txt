venezuelan
crude
sales
to
the
united
states
recovered
in
june
from
may
as
pdvsa
exported
more
of
its
diluted
oil
to
its
customers
and
drained
inventories
from
two
caribbean
islands
affected
by
assets
seizures
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
pdvsa
exports
have
declined
in
recent
months
due
to
a
stubborn
tanker
backlog
around
venezuela
s
main
ports
and
its
crude
output
which
has
stopped
the
firm
from
complying
with
supply
contracts
to
almost
all
of
its
customers
legal
actions
against
pdvsa
by
producer
conocophillips
aimed
to
satisfy
a
billion
arbitration
award
also
have
recently
worsened
the
bottleneck
as
the
venezuelan
firm
is
no
longer
fully
using
its
caribbean
terminals
to
store
and
export
but
an
increase
in
production
of
diluted
crude
oil
or
dco
formulated
by
pdvsa
by
blending
naphtha
and
extra
heavy
oils
while
its
crude
upgraders
are
out
of
service
and
shipments
from
aruba
and
curacao
ahead
of
seizure
attempts
by
conoco
helped
pdvsa

its
joint
ventures
deliver
more
barrels
to
the
united
states
in
june
pdvsa
exported
barrels
per

the

slightly
surpassed

pdvsa
shipped
at
least
four
crude

from
its

depose
citgo
as
preparation
for
a
court
case
against
pdvsa
and
others
over
alleged
asset
transfers
in
the

that
conoco

were
