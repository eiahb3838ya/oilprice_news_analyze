of
america
merrill

did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
the
sale
is
part
of
a
broad
change
of
guard
in
the
aging
north
sea
where
veteran
players
are
seeking
to
dispose
of
older
fields
with
declining
production
while
new
nimbler
companies
believe
they
can
squeeze
out
more
value
last
week
chevron
said
it
was
preparing
to
sell
its
fields
in
the
central
north
sea
royal
dutch
shell
and
bp
have
also
sold
a
large
number
of
fields
in
recent
years
the
laggan
tormore
gas
field
in
which
total
now
has
percent
started
production
in
february
and
can
produce
up
to
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
any
deal
for
the
bruce
and
keith
fields
is
likely
to
be
complicated
however
serica
energy
which
agreed
to
acquire
stakes
in
bruce
keith
and
the
adjacent
rhum
field
from
bp
last
year
is
seeking
a
waiver
from
the
government
to
allow
it
to
operate
rhum
which
is
percent
owned
by
iran
s
national
oil
company
as
washington
prepares
to
sanctions
on
tehran
without
a
waiver
the
field
will
have
to
shut
down
leaving
bruce
and
keith
holding
little
value
