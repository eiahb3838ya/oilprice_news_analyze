don't export old diesels to eastern europe, eu warns german carmakers
berlin
reuters
the
european
commission
fears
that
carmakers
in
germany
would
seek
to
export
old
diesel
cars
removed
from
german
streets
under
planned
incentives
to
eastern
european
countries
industry
commissioner
elzbieta
bienkowska
said
on
sunday
german
carmakers
and
the
government
hashed
out
a
compromise
deal
to
cut
pollution
from
diesel
vehicles
last
week
after
environmental
groups
won
a
victory
in
february
which
allowed
cities
to
ban
older
diesel
cars
the
government
has
asked
carmakers
to
offer
owners
incentives
and
hardware
fixes
not
all
carmakers
committed
to
the
retrofits
as
the
hardware
fixes
are
known
which
would
cost
billions
of
euros
most
said
the
solution
should
be
to
encourage
car
owners
to
trade
in
their
older
diesel
models
for
cleaner
vehicles
which
would
bring
a
boost
in
sales
albeit
at
discounted
prices
exports
would
mean
pushing
the
air
quality
problem
from
the
west
to
the
east
bienkowska
told
the
tagesspiegel
newspaper
in
remarks
to
be
published
on
monday
the
german
government
s
plan
to
avoid
driving
bans
could
intensify
the
germany
s
environment
ministry
has
said
it
would
try
to
overcome
resistance
from
car
makers
to
the
expensive
new
exhaust
filtering
systems
last
year
bulgaria
imported
more
than
second
hand
cars
from
eu
countries
more
than
a
third
of
which
were
grossly
polluting
diesels
according
to
clean
mobility
group
transport
and
environment
it
should
be
clearly
determined
what
happens
to
the
and
poorly
adjusted
vehicles
said
bienkowska
adding
that
the
issue
was
a
european
problem
not
a
national
one
chancellor
angela
merkel
on
saturday
defended
the
compromise
saying
it
was
essential
to
prevent
driving
bans
in
german
cities
which
would
affect
hundreds
of
thousands
of
diesel
car
owners
who
commute
to
work
from
the
countryside
to
urban
centres
but
speaking
at
an
event
of
the
youth
wing
of
her
conservatives
merkel
also
said
car
makers
had
lied
and
cheated
by
selling
diesel
cars
that
pollute
more
than
the
industry
had
said
they
would
diesel
cars
have
come
under
intense
scrutiny
after
volkswagen
in
admitted
to
using
illegal
software
to
cheat
emissions
tests
sparking
a
scandal
that
has
cost
it
more
than
billion
in
penalties
and
fines
that
people
are
becoming
suspicious
is
the
fault
of
the
car
industry
not
politicians
merkel
said
in
the
northern
city
of
kiel
eu
environment
ministers
will
discuss
more
ambitious
car
emission
reduction
targets
when
they
meet
in
luxembourg
on
eu
lawmakers
last
month
backed
carbon
dioxide
reduction
goals
for
fleets
of
cars
and
vans
of
percent
by
ambitious
targets
that
are
unpopular
with
national
governments
