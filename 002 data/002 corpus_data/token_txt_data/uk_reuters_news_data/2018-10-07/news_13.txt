iowa
is
the
largest
producer
of

the
lifting

on

is
expected
to
be
coupled
with
restrictions
on
trading
biofuel
credits
that
underpin
the
program
the
sources
said
but
it
s
unclear
whether
the
restrictions
will
be
detailed

left
up
to
the
environmental
protection

to
decide
the

also
faces
bipartisan

refiners
to
blend
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
like
ethanol

buy
credits

the
summer

was
put
in
place
as
an
measure
though
studies
have
since
shown
its
environmental
benefits
are
limited
trump
will
direct
epa
to
write
a
rule
lifting
the
ban
and
it
would
have
to
be
to
have
it
finalized
before
the
next
summer

season
