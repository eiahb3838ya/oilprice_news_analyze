more

on

the

is
set
to
continue
its
rapid
expansion
into

facilities
approved
for
construction
in
the
first
half
of
the

come
on
line
in
a
development
expected
easily
to
meet
sharp
growth
in
consumption
of
the
fuel
but
a
decline
in
spending
in
the
sector
since
as
a
result
of
weaker
energy
prices
will
create
a
supply
gap
from

new

emerge
shell
said
in
its
lng
outlook
lng
plants
are
complex
and
expensive
requiring
large
processing
units
known
as
trains
that
cool
natural
gas
to
around
minus
degrees
celsius
minus
fahrenheit
the
liquefied
fuel
is
then
shipped
to
demand
centres
and
converted
back
into
gas
while
lng
demand
is
expected
to
grow
from
million
tonnes
per
year

seen
slipping

wetselaar
said
the
cost
of
developing
the
required
capacity
is
roughly
billion
per
mtpa
wetselaar
said
that
does
not
include
investments
in
the
development
of
the
gas
fields
associated
with
lng
plants
he
told
reporters
the
industry
is
still
looking
at
quite
a
challenge
to
build
supplies
to
meet
demand
in
the
he
said
shell
is
considering
moving
ahead
on
new
projects
such
as
lng
canada
and
lake
charles
on
the
gulf
coast
wetselaar
said
the
company
is
expected
this
year
to
launch
the
prelude
floating
lng
plant
in
western
australia
one
of
the
largest
and
most
complex
gas
projects
in
history
our
investment
cycle
is
coming
to
an
end
with
prelude
coming
on
stream
this
year
we
will
have
the
space
to
take
investment
decisions
but
it
doesn
t
necessarily
mean
we
will
spend
the
competition
is
fierce
as
projects
have
to
face
off
against
the
gas
hubs
such
as
north
america
where
the
shale
boom
has
led
to
abundant
and
cheap
supplies
as
well
as
qatar
russia
and
east
africa
in
order
to
take
a
final
investment
decision
on
a
project
of
this
size
you
want
to
make
sure
it
is
as
as
it
can
be
because
the
cost
of
an
lng
project
is
going
to
stick
with
you
for
years
wetselaar
said
in
its
annual
report
a
legacy
from
bg
group
which
the
company
acquired
in
shell
forecast
global
demand
for
gas
to
grow
by
an
average
percent
per
year
until
that
would
make
gas
the
source
of
energy
over
the
period
lng
demand
is
set
to
grow
twice
as
fast
as
gas
power
plants
in
china
south
korea
and
india
switch
from
coal
and
governments
move
to
reduce
carbon
emissions
