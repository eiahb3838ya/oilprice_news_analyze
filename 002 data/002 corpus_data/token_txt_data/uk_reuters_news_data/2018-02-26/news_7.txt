the

will
steer
a
steady
course
on

the
pace
of

rate
hikes
has
made
investors
skittish
since
the
beginning
of
february
and
weighed
on
stock
markets
worldwide
but
most
traders
believe
powell
will
stay
the
course
and
gradually
raise
interest
rates
despite
indications
inflation
is
perking
up
there
s
some
talk
of
powell
being
a
little
more
open
to
tolerating
inflation
running
above
the
target
the
focus
will
be
to
see
