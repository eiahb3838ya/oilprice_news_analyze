grid
corporation
of

sgcc
deep
pockets
will
likely
overcome
any
german
political
resistance
to
a

sources
said
the
latest
sign
of
chinese
interest
in
the

sgcc
the

is
in
talks
with
australian
infrastructure

ifm
investors
about
buying

said
on
friday
it
had
two
months
to
decide
whether
to
exercise
a
right
to
buy
the
percent
stake
from
ifm
before
sgcc
can
bid
but
investment
banking
sources
said
it
was
unlikely
elia
would
match
sgcc
s
price
as
it
already
has
operational
control
sgcc
is
expected
to
bid
million
to
billion

million
to
billion
for
the

stake

that
dwarfs
the
million
sweden

received
when
it
sold
in
given
the
price
there
will
not
be
a
counterbid
from
a
third
party
one
of
the
sources
said
once
elia
takes
its
decision
the
stake
sale
will
finally
go
a
second
banker
said
sgcc
s
price
would
be
so
outrageously
attractive
that
ifm
would
have
no
choice
but
to
negotiate
a
sale

sgcc
has
quietly
amassed
a
networks
portfolio
in
southern
europe
buying
stakes
in
portuguese
italian
and
greek
grid
operators
but
despite
discreet
overtures
it
has
yet
to
get
a
foot
in
the
door
in
northern
europe
as
opportunities
are
rare
and
chinese
infrastructure
investment
faces
political
hurdles
in
the
german

industry
china

bought
an
offshore

park
and
beijing

acquired

but
neither
of
those
deals
were
deemed
strategic
enough
to
raise
political
concerns
acquisitions
by
chinese
firms
of

if
the

involves
a
