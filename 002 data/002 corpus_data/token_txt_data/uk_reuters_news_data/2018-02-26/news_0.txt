column-commentary: can lab-grown meat feed - and save - the world?
paul
shapiro
is
the
author
of
clean
meat
how
growing
meat
without
animals
will
revolutionize
dinner
and
the
the
opinions
expressed
here
are
his
own

darkest
hour
is
fascinating
audiences
with
its
portrayal
of
winston
churchill
facing
decisions
at
a
turning
point
in
world
war
two
in
fact
churchill
had
been
thinking
about
the
future
of
humanity
in
rather
radical
ways
for
years
already
in
churchill
published
an
essay
fifty
years
hence
in
which
he
made
predictions
about
what
the
world
might
look
like
by
the
among
the
more
stunning
that
humans
would
figure
out
how
to
permanently
divorce
meat
production
from
animal
husbandry
we
shall
escape
the
absurdity
of
growing
a
whole
chicken
in
order
to
eat
the
breast
or
wing
churchill
prophesied
by
growing
these
parts
separately
under
a
suitable
because
doing
so
would
free
up
land
that
had
been
used
for
growing
crops
to
feed
farm
animals
he
concluded
parks
and
gardens
will
cover
our
pastures
and
ploughed
churchill
was
a
few
decades
off
but
we
now
have
the
capacity
to
do
exactly
as
he
foresaw
to
grow
real
meat
outside
of
animals
bodies
in
recent
years
clean
meat
a
term
first
popularized
by
the
nonprofit
good
food
institute
as
a
nod
to
both
clean
energy
and
to
the
meat
s
food
safety
benefits
has
moved
out
of
the
realm
of
science
fiction
and
become
scientific
fact
the
first
clean
burger
debuted
in
thanks
in
part
to
research
and
development
funding
from
google
sergey
brin
since
i
ve
had
the
good
fortune
to
eat
clean
beef
duck
fish
chorizo
liver
and
yogurt
all
of
it
grown
without
animals
perhaps
unsurprisingly
clean
meat
tastes
like
meat
since
well
that
s
exactly
what
it
is
and
i
m
not
the
only
one
interested
these
products
are
starting
to
get
serious
attention
from
traditional
meat
processors
with
agribusiness
giants
tyson
and
cargill
investing
in
memphis
meats
a
clean
meat
based
in
san
leandro
it
s
not
a
threat
to
us
it
s
an
opportunity
sonya
mccullum
roberts
president
of
growth
ventures
at
cargill
recently
told
fortune
magazine
to
be
clear
the
clean
meat
that
churchill
envisioned
and
that
companies
like
memphis
meats
are
beginning
to
produce
isn
t
simply
an
alternative
to
meat
it
s
actual
animal
muscle
tissue
produced
without
the
living
conscious
animal
rather
than
raising
chickens
or
pigs
to
slaughter
and
sell
as
cuts
of
meat
clean
meat
producers
take
microscopic
animal
cells
put
them
in
a
cultivator
so
they
behave
as
they
do
in
the
body
and
feed
them
so
they
that
grow
into
muscle
tissue
just
like
the
meat
we
eat
today
why
would
we
want
to
do
as
churchill
suggested
and
start
producing
real
meat
without
animals
well
for
starters
because
raising
farm
animals
takes
vast
resources
to
put
the
problem
in
perspective
imagine
walking
through
the
poultry
aisle
of
your
local
supermarket
for
each
whole
chicken
you
see
envision
more
than
one
thousand
jugs
of
water
sitting
next
to
it
then
imagine
systematically
one
by
one
twisting
the
cap
off
each
jug
and
pouring
them
all
out
that
s
about
how
much
water
it
takes
to
bring
a
single
chicken
from
shell
to
shelf
in
other
words
you
can
save
more
water
by
skipping
one
family
chicken
dinner
than
by
skipping
six
months
of
showers
growing
only
the
meat
we
want
won
t
require
all
the
resources
needed
to
produce
entire
animals
a
study
by
oxford
university
researcher
hanna
tuomisto
estimated
that
clean
beef
production
could
require
percent
less
land
and
percent
less
water
while
producing
percent
fewer
greenhouse
gas
emissions
than
conventional
beef
production
such
early
studies
are
admittedly
imprecise
since
the
technologies
that
will
make
clean
meat
commercially
viable
are
still
under
development
but
most
analysts
believe
that
even
production
of
meat
is
likely
to
be
far
more
than
traditional
livestock
production
churchill
s
vision
of
synthetic
meat
isn
t
yet
a
reality
but
it
s
likely
a
matter
of
years
now
not
decades
meanwhile
meats
are
already
helping
many
of
us
to
wean
ourselves
off
the
factory
farming
of
animals
those
who
worry
that
churchill
s
vision
of
meat
without
animals
is
unnatural
may
find
it
helpful
to
recall
just
how
unsustainable
inhumane
and
unnatural
contemporary
meat
production
has
become
clean
meat
probably
won
t
be
competing
for
market
share
against
meat
from
animals
rather
clean
meat
enthusiasts
seek
to
displace
the
farm
animals
providing
the
vast
majority
of
the
meat
we
eat
today
animals
that
languish
in
their
own
feces
never
set
foot
outdoors
and
are
forced
to
consume
large
quantities
of
antibiotics
and
other
drugs
if
we
pause
to
contemplate
this
harsh
reality
the
promise
of
clean
meat
seems
obvious
churchill
had
a
lot
on
his
plate
when
he
became
prime
minister
yet
his
predictions
about
the
contents
of
our
plates
may
have
even
greater
relevance
today
as
we
search
for
ways
to
reduce
the
harm
we
re
doing
to
the
only
planet
we
have
clean
meat
may
soon
prove
to
be
part
of
the
solution
