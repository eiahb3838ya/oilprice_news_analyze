farm
groups
urged
president
donald
trump
in
a
letter
on
monday
not
to
weaken
the
nation
s
biofuels
policy
requiring
ethanol
to
be
blended
into
gasoline
calling
it
a
critical
engine
of
rural
american
jobs
trump
is
due
to
meet
with
senators
and
cabinet
members
on
tuesday
to
discuss
potential
tweaks
to
the
law
called
the
renewable
fuel
standard
that
would
help
oil
refiners
who
have
increasingly
complained
the
program
costs
them
a
fortune
as
you
meet
this
week
to
discuss
these
issues
we
ask
that
you
not
entertain
proposals
that
would
undermine
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
rfs
according
to
the
letter
signed
by
the
heads
of
six
farm
groups
including
the
national
corn
growers
association
and
the
american
farm
bureau
federation
any
action
that
seeks
to
weaken
the
rfs
for
the
benefit
of
a
handful
of
refiners
will
by
extension
be
borne
on
the
backs
of
our
farmers
according
to
the
letter
a
copy
of
which
was
seen
by
reuters
the
rfs
requires
oil
refiners
to
cover
the
cost
of
blending
increasing
amounts
of
ethanol
and
other
biofuels
into
the
nation
s
fuels
each
year
the
policy
was
adopted
during
president
george
bush
s
administration
to
help
farmers
cut
petroleum
imports
and
lower
pollutant
emissions
under
the
program
refiners
must
earn
or
purchase
biofuel
blending
credits
called
rins
to
prove
that
they
are
complying
as
biofuels
volume
quotas
have
increased
over
the
years
so
have
prices
for
the
credits
meaning
refiners
that
must
buy
them
are
facing
rising
costs

other
factors
