asian
share
markets
were
in
a
cautious
mood
on
monday
as
investors
braced
for
an
week
headlined
by
inflation
data
and
the
first
house
testimony
by
the
new
head
of
the
federal
reserve
sentiment
was

china
s

on

set
the
stage
for
president
xi
jinping
to
stay
in
office
indefinitely
with
a
proposal
to
remove
a
constitutional
clause
limiting
presidential
service
to
just
two
terms
in
office
investors
initially
took
heart
from
friday
s
rally
on
wall
street
which
saw
the
vix
volatility
index
end
at
percent
far
below
the
percent
peak
touched
at
the
height
of
market
turmoil
in
early
february
the
mood
has
calmed
partly
thanks
to
expectations
the
federal
reserve
will
stay
gradual
in
its
tightening
a
measured
outlook
underlined
by
the
central
bank
in
a
governors
report
released
on
friday
investors
also
seem
to
be
wagering
that
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
will
stick
to
that
script
at
his
first
appearance
before
the
house
on
tuesday
followed
by
testimony
to
the
senate
on
thursday
powell
will
be
highly
cognisant
of
the
spike
in
risk
aversion
in
late
january
and
will
be
keen
not
to
rock
the
boat
too
greatly
argued
chris
weston
chief
market
strategist
at
broker
ig
futures
markets
on
friday
were
pricing
in
less
implied
policy
tightening
from
the
fed
in
the
years
ahead
suggesting
traders
are
not
expecting
powell
to
signal
a
more
aggressive
yields
on
treasuries
had
also
backed
off
to
percent
and
away
from
a
top
of
percent
an
added
wrinkle
is
that
the
fed
s
favoured
measure
of
inflation
the
core
personal
consumption
expenditure
pce
index
is
out
early
on
thursday
markets
will
be
to
any
hint
of
a
in
core
inflation
given
the
surprising
strength
of
wages
in
january
and
powell
is
certain
to
be
questioned
on
the
risks
by
senators
in
currency
markets
the
dollar
surrendered
early
gains
to
dip
percent
on
a
basket
of
currencies
to
that
followed
a
percent
bounce
last
week
it
also
retreated
on
the
yen
to
reach
failing
to
hold
an
early
top
the
euro
was
hovering
at
and
just
above

trough

bulls
cautious
ahead
of
the
outcome
of
the
italian
general
