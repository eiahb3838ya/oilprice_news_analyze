asian
markets
were
in
a

upbeat
mood
on
monday
heading
into
an
week
headlined
by
inflation
data
and
the
first
house
testimony
by
the
new
head
of
the
federal

a

far
below
the

peak
touched
at
the
height
of
market
turmoil
in
early
february
the
mood
has
calmed
partly
thanks
to
expectations
the
federal
reserve
will
stay
gradual
in
its
tightening
a
measured
outlook
underlined
by
the
central
bank
in
a
governors
report
released
on
friday
investors
also
seem
to
be
wagering
that
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
will
stick
to
that
script
at
his
first
appearance
before
the
house
on
tuesday
followed
by
testimony
to
the
senate
on
thursday
powell
will
be
highly
cognisant
of
the
spike
in
risk
aversion
in
late
january
and
will
be
keen
not
to
rock
the
boat
too
greatly
argued
chris
weston
chief

strategist
at

ig
futures
markets
on
friday
were
pricing
in
less
implied
policy
tightening
from
the

suggesting
traders
are
not
expecting
powell
to
signal
a

aggressive
yields
on
treasuries
had
also
backed
off
to
percent
and
away
from
a
top
of
percent
an
added
wrinkle
is
that
the
fed
s
favoured
measure
of
inflation
the
core
personal
consumption
expenditure
pce
index
is
out
early
on
thursday
markets
will
be
to
any
hint
of
a
in
core
inflation
given
the
surprising
strength
of
wages
in
january
and
powell
is
certain
to
be
questioned
on
the
risks
by
senators
in
currency
markets
the
dollar
inched
up

against
a
basket
of

adding
