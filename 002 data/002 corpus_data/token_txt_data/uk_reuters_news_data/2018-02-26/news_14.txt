in
an

suspension
plant
which

last
year
and
a
filtration
facility
in
morocco
that
will
be
launched
by

sogefi
chose
morocco
because
of
its
competitiveness
and
because
of
future
car
manufacturing
that
might
be
based
in

be
greater
than
the

spent
in

present
in

sites
sogefi
is
looking
at
partnerships
with

take
stakes
of
at

percent
to
help
them
grow
sogefi
s
main
clients
include
mass
market
player
such
as
carmaker
ford
france
s
renault
and
psa
group
and
fiat
chrysler
but
it
also
hopes
to
increase
the
share
of
sales
to
german
premium
carmakers
such
as
daimler
and
bmw
to
invest
in
technology
and
give
it
a
boost
over
german
rivals
mubea
and
mahle
hebenstreit
said
the
shift
away
from
diesel
engines
does
not
worry
sogefi
which
expects
the
technology
to
support
sales
for
years
to
come
but
the
real
growth
will
come
from
the
higher
technology
requirement
in
hybrid
vehicles
and
completely
new
products
that
a
shift
to
electrification
will
require
he
said
he
dismissed
the
idea

outperform
a
projected

growth
in
the
market
by

at
constant
exchange
rates
helped
by
the
mexico
and
morocco
investments
he
also
expects
sogefi
s
profit
to
increase
but
did
not
say
by
how
much
sogefi
has
not
paid
a
dividend
in
five
years
given
the
investments
that
we
have
ahead
of
us
it
s
too
early
hebenstreit
said
