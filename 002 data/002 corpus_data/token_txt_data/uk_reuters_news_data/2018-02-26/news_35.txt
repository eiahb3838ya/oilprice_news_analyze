global
stocks
notched
further
gains
on
monday
and
the
dollar
stayed
on
the
back
foot
as
investors
bet
the
new
head
of
the
federal
reserve
will
steer
a
steady
course
on
policy
when
he
addresses
lawmakers
this
week
msci
s
index
of
world
stocks
was
up
percent
with
the
stoxx
up
percent
asian
markets
also
rose
with
chinese
stocks
up
percent
after
the
ruling
communist
party
set
the
stage
for
president
xi
jinping
to
stay
in
office
indefinitely
much
of
the
market
s
focus
during
the
coming
week
will
be
on
monetary
policy
with
the
heads
of
the
european
central
bank
and
bank
of
england
set
to
give
speeches
but
they
are
likely
to
be
overshadowed
by
fed
chair
jerome
powell
stock
markets
calmed
on
friday
after
the
fed
said
it
saw
steady
economic
growth
continuing
and
no
serious
risks
on
the
horizon
investors
also
seem
to
be
wagering
that
powell
will
stick
to
that
script
at
his
first
appearance
before
the
house
on
tuesday
followed
by
testimony
to
the
senate
on
thursday
given
he
s
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
committee
it
would
be
a
big
surprise
to
see
much
deviation
from
recent
fed
commentary
but
much
will
probably
be
made
of
how
he
handles
the
scrutiny
said
jim
reid
a
macro
strategist
at
deutsche
bank
the
expected
lack
of
policy
surprises
from
powell
saw
yields
on
treasuries
back
off
to
percent
and
away
from
a
top
of
percent
dragging
down
the
dollar
the
currency
surrendered
early
gains
to
dip
percent
against
a
basket
of
currencies
to
that
followed
a
percent
bounce
last
week
sterling
was
up
percent
on
monday
after
bank
of
england
deputy
governor
dave
ramsden
said
the
bank
might
need
to
raise
interest
rates
somewhat
sooner
than
he
had
expected
if
wage
growth
picked
up
early
this
year
the
pound
also
benefited
from
hopes
that
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
might
be
less
disruptive
than
feared
with
opposition
leader
jeremy
corbyn
set
to
give
a
speech
on
monday
backing
a
new
customs
union
with
the
bloc
the
euro
was
percent
firmer
on
the
back
of
dollar
weakness
though
investors
largely
held
back
from
taking
big
positions
ahead
of
a
national
election
in
italy
and
the
conclusion
of
coalition
talks
in
germany
ecb
president
mario
draghi
is
also
set
to
appear
before
the
european
parliament
later
in
the
day
while
boe
governor
mark
carney
speaks
in
edinburgh
on
friday
in
commodities
oil
prices
steadied
after
hitting
their
highest
level
in
nearly
three
weeks
supported
by
comments
from
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
that
it
would
continue
to
curb
shipments
in
line
with
the
effort
to
cut
global
supplies
