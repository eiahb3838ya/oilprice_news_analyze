london
reuters
prime
minister
theresa
may
will
cap
the
energy
bills
of
million
british
households
for
as
long
as
five
years
under
a
new
law
introduced
to
parliament
on
monday
aimed
at
tackling
what
she
describes
as
energy
prices
the
new
legislation
will
force
the
energy
regulator
ofgem
to
cap
electricity
and
gas
prices
until
when
the
regulator
will
recommend
whether
it
should
be
extended
on
an
annual
basis
up
to
the
government
said
the
government
said
that
some
customers
are
being
charged
more
than
pounds
than
they
should
be
and
the
cap
will
apply
to
expensive
plans
that
customers
are
moved
to
when
their
cheaper
fixed
deals
end
it
s
often
older
people
or
those
on
low
incomes
who
are
stuck
on
energy
tariffs
so
today
we
are
introducing
legislation
to
force
energy
companies
to
change
their
ways
may
said
our
energy
price
cap
will
cut
bills
for
millions
of
families
this
is
another
step
we
are
taking
to
help
people
make
ends
meet
as
we
build
a
country
that
works
for
a
report
by
a
committee
of
lawmakers
earlier
this
month
found
that
the
current
energy
market
is
broken
and
penalises
customer
loyalty
home
power
bills
have
doubled
in
britain
over
the
past
decade
to
an
average
of
about
pounds
a
year
the
energy
company
centrica
said
while
it
agreed
that
standard
variable
rates
are
a
problem
for
customers
because
they
have
no
end
dates
price
controls
are
the
wrong
solution
we
just
do
not
agree
with
introducing
price
controls
into
a
competitive
market
which
will
reduce
competition
and
choice
and
therefore
impact
consumers

company
