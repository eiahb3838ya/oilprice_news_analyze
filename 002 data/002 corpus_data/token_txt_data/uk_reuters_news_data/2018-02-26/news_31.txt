east
timor
and
australia
have
reached
an
agreement
for
a
treaty
on
their
disputed
maritime
border
and
on
a
pathway
to
develop
the
giant
greater
sunrise
offshore
gas
fields
the
permanent
court
of
arbitration
said
on
monday
under
the
agreement
the
share
of
revenue
from
the
offshore
gas
field
will
differ
depending
on
downstream
benefits
that
arise
from
different
development
concepts
the
statement
said
following
talks
in
kuala
lumpur
the
agreement
would
establish
a
maritime
boundary
in
the
timor
sea
for
the
first
time
australia
had
sought
a
boundary
aligned
with
its
continental
shelf
but
east
timor
argued
the
border
should
lie
half
way
between
it
and
australia
placing
much
of
the
greater
sunrise
fields
under
its
control
the
dispute
had
led
the
owners
of
greater
sunrise
woodside
petroleum
conocophillips
royal
dutch
shell
and
japan
s
osaka
gas
to
shelve
the
project
the
fields
are
estimated
to
hold
trillion
cubic
feet
of
gas
and
million
barrels
of
condensates
which
analysts
have
previously
estimated
could
be
worth
billion
billion
however
development
could
be
at
least
a
decade
away
with
woodside
looking
at
the
latter
half
of
the
next
decade
ending
years
of
opposition
australia
agreed
in
to
accept
dili
s
formal
notice
to
terminate
an
agreement
to
split
petroleum
revenue
equally
from
greater
sunrise
and
set
a
timetable
for
negotiating
a
permanent
sea
boundary
dili
had
taken
the
maritime
border
dispute
to
the
permanent
court
of
arbitration
an
intergovernmental
organisation
based
at
the
hague
which
ordered
compulsory
arbitration
between
the
two
parties
the
court
announced
last
year
that
the
countries
had
reached
an
agreement
on
the
central
elements
of
a
maritime
boundary
delimitation
between
them
in
the
timor
sea
but
that
details
would
remain
confidential
until
the
deal
was
finalised
the
two
governments
will
meet
in
new
york
at
the
united
nations
headquarters
on
march
to
sign
the
new
maritime
boundary
treaty
the
statement
said
east
timor
had
been
pushing
for
the
building
of
an
onshore
processing
plant
to
boost
its
economy
rather
than
a
floating
plant
according
to
media
reports
east
timor
could
receive
up
to
percent
of
revenue
but
could
agree
to
less
if
gas
is
piped
to
a
terminal
in
the
tiny
country
the
sunrise
joint
venture
led
by
woodside
said
it
was
aware
that
the
two
governments
have
agreed
a
new
maritime
boundaries
treaty
we
hope
that
the
commission
s
conclusions
and
the
signing
of
the
treaty
will
help
to
provide
the
fiscal
and
regulatory
certainty
required
to
develop
greater
sunrise
for
the
benefit
of
all
parties
a
sunrise

venture
