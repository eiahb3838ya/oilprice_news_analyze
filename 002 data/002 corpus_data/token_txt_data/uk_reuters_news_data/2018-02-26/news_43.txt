half
of
india
s
states
and
union
territories
have
introduced
a
blanket
ban
on
plastic
bags
and
yet
many
shoppers
remain
wedded
to
the
flimsy
carrier
bags
while
plastic
waste
still
litters
the
streets
of
the
south
asian
nation
in
jammu
and
kashmir
became
the
latest
state
to
prohibit
all
polythene
bags
in
accordance
with
a
ruling
by
its
high
court
it
joins
other
states
and
territories
governed
by
new
delhi
that
have
imposed
a
complete
ban
on
the
sale
and
use
of
plastic
bags
including
madhya
pradesh
and
punjab
five
other
states
goa
gujarat
kerala
odisha
and
west
bengal
have
partial
bans
on
the
use
of
plastic
bags
around
sites
of
religious
historical
or
natural
importance
or
during
the
pilgrimage
season
according
to
data
provided
to
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
by
india
s
central
pollution
control
board
despite
this
change
is
barely
visible
on
the
ground
in
mountainous
jammu
and
kashmir
for
example
shopkeepers
and
vegetable
sellers
still
pack
goods
in
plastic
carrier
bags
before
handing
them
over
to
customers
we
have
been
hearing
this
for
a
long
time
i
don
t
think
the
ban
is
going
to
work
said
mohammad
yasin
who
sells
vegetables
in
srinagar
city
s
zainakote
area
the
government
of
jammu
and
kashmir
had
already
banned
bags
made
of
polythene
a
common
form
of
plastic
with
a
thickness
of
less
than
microns
a
year
ago
but
to
little
effect
it
is
not
only
up
to
us
the
customers
share
major
responsibility
they
should
carry
their
own
reusable
bags
if
they
do
so
the
ban
will
work
yasin
said
more
importantly
the
country
needs
to
stop
making
polythene
he
added
several
other
shopkeepers
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
spoke
to
agreed
if
the
government
is
serious
about
stopping
the
use
of
polythene
it
should
ban
its
manufacturing
that
will
force
people
to
carry
their
own
bags
said
abdul
rashid
a
shopkeeper
in
srinagar
s
commercial
hub
lal
chowk
red
square
india
s
plastics
industry
employs
about
million
people
and
has
more
than
processing
units
according
to
the
india
brand
equity
foundation
set
up
by
the
government
to
promote
made
in
india
products
internationally
domestic
consumption
of
plastic
is
expected
to
reach
million
metric
tonnes
per
year
by
while
exports
of
plastic
products
were
worth
billion
in
srinagar
deputy
commissioner
syed
abid
said
the
jammu
and
kashmir
government
was
committed
to
stamping
out
plastic
bags
we
have
constituted
special
squads
for
enforcing
the
ban
and
we
are
also
seizing
polythene
wherever
we
find
it
in
use
he
said
in
an
interview
some
environmental
experts
say
carrying
plastic
bags
should
be
punishable
by
law
as
of
now
only
the
traders
or
shopkeepers
are
penalised
which
doesn
t
affect
people
who
compel
the
shopkeepers
to
provide
them
with
plastic
bags
said
samiullah
bhat
assistant
professor
in
the
environmental
science
department
at
the
university
of
kashmir
riyaz
ahmad
wani
the
commissioner
of
srinagar
municipal
corporation
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
authority
may
consider
imposing
fines
on
those
who
carry
polythene
bags
under
a
new
policy
for
solid
waste
management
now
being
drafted
in
march
the
karnataka
state
government
issued
a
circular
stipulating
that
no
one
should
use
plastic
products
including
bags
banners
bunting
flags
plates
cups
spoons
cling
film
and
table
cloths
it
also
said
those
items
should
not
be
manufactured
supplied
stored
transported
sold
or
distributed

a
fellow
at
the
ashoka
trust
for
research
in
ecology
and
the
environment
atree
said
the
ban
has
had
some
impact
there
but
enforcement
is
patchy
civil
servants
in
several
departments
are
tasked
with
putting
it
into
practice
but
proof
of
their
work
needs
to
be
collected
and
verified
independently
said
shenoy
without
such
a
system
responsibility
gets
shunted
between
departments
leading
to
dilution
of
enforcement
she
said
moreover
several
political
parties
including
the
ruling
party
often
use
banners
bunting
and
other
plastic
products
as
bureaucrats
struggle
to
implement
the
rules
she
added
as
far
back
as
two
indian
supreme
court
judges
warned
the
next
generation
will
be
threatened
with
something
more
serious
than
the
atom
bomb
in
the
absence
of
a
total
ban
on
plastic
but
progress
towards
that
aspiration
is
slow
a
report
by
the
central
pollution
control
board
said
indian
cities
produced
more
than
tonnes
of
plastic
waste
every
day
of
this
tonnes
were
collected
and
processed
while
the
rest
littered
the
streets
and
drains
or
was
dumped
in
landfill
about
of
the
plastic
waste
was
a
mix
of
polythene
bags
and
food
packaging
mainly
from
residential
areas
it
said
in
indian
prime
minister
narendra
modi
noted
that
cows
a
sacred
animal
for
many
indians
were
dying
after
consuming
plastic
and
urged
those
concerned
about
their
welfare
to
stop
it
happening
according
to
a
june
study
published
in
the
journal
nature
communications
rivers
mostly
in
asia
carry
into
the
sea
about
of
the
plastic
in
the
world
s
oceans
with
the
river
ganges
crossing
india
and
bangladesh
responsible
for
the
amount
among
them
swati
singh
sambyal
programme
manager
for
environmental
governance
at
the
new
centre
for
science
and
environment
said
a
ban
on
plastic
bags
would
only
work
if
their
manufacture
was
stopped
and
cheaper
alternatives
made
available
a
jute
bag
or
a
cloth
bag
is
way
beyond
the
reach
of
a
vendor
only
big
malls
or
shops
can
use
them
she
said
charging
for
polythene
bags
is
another
way
to
incentivise
shoppers
to
bring
reusable
bags
while
shopkeepers
who
give
out
plastic
bags
should
be
fined
she
added
meanwhile
she
urged
cities
to
start
information
campaigns
behaviour
change
through
mass
awareness
is
imperative
she
said
adding
few
efforts
of
this
kind
have
been
made
so
far
atree
s
shenoy
said
citizens
could
help
enforce
the
ban
by
using
cameras
on
their
smartphones
and
data
collection
apps
while
the
authorities
should
report
publicly
on
progress
the
government
could
also
support
businesses
that
offer
sustainable
alternatives
to
plastics
she
added
some
companies
for
example
are
making
bags
bin
liners
and
packaging
from
natural
starch
vegetable
oil
derivatives
and
vegetable
waste
which
they
say
are
biodegradable
and
to
flora
and
fauna
although
they
are
still
more
expensive
than
their
plastic
equivalents
