mexican
oil
company
pemex
reported
a
nearly
billion
loss
on
monday
after
both
crude
output
and
processing
slid
though
the
company
said
refining
levels
should
rebound
as
major
maintenance
plans
are
completed
the
company
posted
a
billion
bln
peso
loss
for
the
last
quarter
of
blaming
a
weaker
peso
exchange
rate
and
higher
financing
costs
for
its
performance
according
to
a
filing
with
the
mexican
stock
exchange
the
loss
compares
to
a
profit
of
some
billion
mexican
pesos
in
the
period
maintenance
at
pemex
s
ciudad
madero
and
minatitlan
refineries
will
be
completed
by
the
end
of
march
senior
executive
josefa
casas
said
on
a
call
with
analysts
boosting
crude
processing
at
both
facilities
should
help
reverse
a
prolonged
decline
in
refining
levels
investment
resources
continue
in
the
maintenance
of
pemex
s
six
refineries
with
the
intention
of
not
only
stabilizing
operations
but
also
positively
increasing
crude
processing
margins
in
the
production
of
refined
products
said

pemex
lost
billion
pesos
during
the
fourth
quarter
due
to
a
weaker
peso
the
company
said
which
depreciated
percent
against
the
dollar
while
most
of
pemex
s
costs
are
in
pesos
it
sells
crude
oil
and
buys
imported
fuels
like
gasoline
in
dollars
financial
costs
were
up
percent
during
the
quarter
mainly
because
of
larger
indebtedness
the
company
said
also
weighing
on
the
quarterly
result
pemex
s
tax
bill
more
than
doubled
to
reach
billion
pesos
crude
oil
production
was
down
about
percent
during
the
quarter
at
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
total
crude
output
averaged
million
bpd
down
nearly
percent
compared
to
production
which
the
company
said
was
due
in
large
part
to
the
natural
decline
of
its
fields
meanwhile
crude
processing
at
the
company
s
six
refineries
dipped
to
just
bpd
during
the
quarter
despite
a
processing
capacity
of
about
million
bpd
pemex
s
annual
crude
processing
in
averaged
bpd
compared
to
bpd
in
the
lower
level
of
refining
activity
was
blamed
on
the
impact
of
natural
disasters
including
a
major
earthquake
on
pemex
s
salina
cruz
facility
the
company
s
biggest
casas
added
that
pemex
continues
to
look
for
partners
at
its
salina
cruz
and
salamanca
refineries
both
of
which
need
to
be
reconfigured
to
better
process
