analysis-oil like gas: s&p global platts bags asian lng price benchmark
singapore
reuters
asia
s
booming
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
market
has
seen
exchanges
and
commodity
price
agencies
vie
to
become
the
region
s
leading
price
benchmark
that
race
seems
over
with
s
p
global
platts
emerging
the
winner
over
rivals
including
other
price
reporting
agencies
and
exchanges
with
over
percent
of
global
lng
consumed
in
asia
and
growth
concentrated
in
this
region
it
adds
a
potentially
lucrative
business
to
the
company
s
already
profitable
operations
providing
oil
price
assessments
platts
says
lng
swaps
volumes
settled
against
its
japan
korea
marker
jkm
lng
price
assessments
quadrupled
in
to
lots
equivalent
to
around
tankers
of
lng
and
the
growth
has
continued
this
year
january
was
a
record
month
for
jkm
derivatives
with
over
lots
cleared
equivalent
to
over
lng
cargoes
said
dave
ernsberger
head
of
energy
pricing
at
s
p
global
platts
platts
provides
price
assessments
of
spot
lng
cargoes
traded
in
asia
and
analysts
and
traders
estimate
the
vast
majority
of
deals
are
priced
using
its
benchmark
the
intercontinental
exchange
which
operates
financial
and
commodities
markets
also
provides
a
swaps
contract
for
lng
that
uses
the
platts
benchmark
as
the
price
for
the
underlying
asset
more
than
lng
lots
were
traded
in
january
each
lot
is
over
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
the
contract
is
increasingly
seen
as
the
benchmark
for
lng
in
asia
gordon
bennett
managing
director
of
utility
markets
at
ice
said
in
a
client
note
the
cme
group
which
operates
derivatives
markets
has
a
similar
arrangement
although
only
lots
were
traded
in
january
on
its
platform
early
starter
advantage
platts
started
its
jkm
in
and
the
with
ice
seems
to
have
won
platts
the
race
to
be
the
main
supplier
of
the
price
marker
in
asia
creating
critical
liquidity
that
is
crucial
for
any
market
to
develop
according
to
several
senior
traders
other
price
reporting
agencies
and
exchanges
including
japan
s
tokyo
commodity
exchange
tocom
and
the
singapore
exchange
have
vied
for
a
slice
of
the
pie
but
have
struggled
for
significant
market
share
tocom
declined
to
comment
while
sgx
said
there
was
strong
interest
in
its
middle
east
and
india
lng
derivatives
contract
known
as
the
a
sudden
growth
in
spot
trading
of
lng
in
asia
has
also
been
fortuitous
for
platts
most
lng
is
traded
via
supply
contracts
but
spot
trading
took
off
from
and
made
the
need
for
a
price
assessment
to
settle
trades
more
urgent
china
s
imports
rose
rapidly
and
some
newer
suppliers
to
the
market
were
willing
to
break
with
traditional
supply
contracts
and
provide
spot
cargoes
instead
flexible
volumes
from
the
and
new
supplies
from
australia
papua
new
guinea
and
africa
increased
the
number
of
spot
transactions
said
lng
firm
tellurian
in
a
note
to
clients
this
month
the
number
of
participants
increased
to
around
compared
with
at
the
start
if
tellurian
said
the
increased
liquidity
will
fuel
further
volumes
of
trading
activity
people
in
the
market
say
the
ability
to
enter
and
more
importantly
exit
trades
is
critical
when
trading
in
financial
markets
said
tobias
davis
head
of
at
brokerage
tullett
prebon
which
also
facilitates
trade
in
jkm
swaps
as
the
jkm
benchmark
has
become
more
widely
adopted
liquidity
in
the
paper
swaps
market
has
grown
exponentially
he
added
china
s
surge
in
demand
has
ironically
left
the
jkm
named
after
the
dominant
lng
importers
when
it
was
launched
somewhat
misnamed
given
china
s
rise
while
japan
remains
the
world
s
biggest
lng
importer
china
overtook
south
korea
to
become
the
buyer
last
year
and
most
analysts
say
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
before
china
surpasses
japan
most
traders
say
platts
current
success
is
based
on
the
link
between
its
price
assessments
and
the
swaps
trading
on
ice
but
if
history
is
a
guide
the
assessments
could
lose
favour
over
time
as
the
asia
market
develops
saul
kavonic
principal
analyst
at
energy
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
argues
if
and
when
a
true
asian
lng
trading
hub
and
platform
evolves
then
price
discovery
will
move
toward
being
based
on
an
exchange
and
futures
will
move
to
derivatives
contracts
as
we
ve
seen
in
europe
and
north
america
where
exchange
prices
like
the
henry
hub
or
britain
s
national
balance
point
not
platts
dominate
the
market
he
said
australian
energy
and
mining
giant
bhp
said
this
week
in
its
annual
outlook
that
a
future
global
gas
market
would
be
potentially
harmonised
around
the
henry
hub
as
producers
export
lng
based
on
this
benchmark
