rpt-column-for coal miners, it's time to exit or get rich: russell
repeats
earlier
story
for
wider
readership
with
no
change
to
text
the
opinions
expressed
here
are
those
of
the
author
a
columnist
for
reuters
by

it
seems
coal
miners
are
adopting
one
of
two
disparate
strategies
either
exit
the
business
in
a
highly
visible
way
to
buff
up
your
climate
credentials
or
sit
tight
keep
as
quiet
as
possible
and
rake
in
the
cash
an
example
of
the
public
exit
from
the
business
is
the
miner
spun
out
of
bhp
billiton
which
is
in
the
process
of
selling
out
of
its
thermal
coal
assets
in
south
africa
mike
fraser
s
president
and
chief
operating
office
for
south
africa
told
reuters
earlier
this
month
that
the
company
was
aiming
to
sell
its
coal
assets
because
it
did
not
believe
in
the
it
would
also
be
better
if
the
coal
mines
were
by
black
investors
fraser
said
this
is
a
reasonable
recognition
that
it
s
increasingly
hard
for
companies
without
black
investors
to
do
business
in
south
africa
given
its
laws
and
rules
aimed
at
promoting
the
economic
interests
of
the
majority
population
following
centuries
of
discrimination
under
first
colonial
and
then
rule
joins
anglo
american
in
getting
out
of
south
african
coal
with
the
miner
selling
the
last
of
its
domestic
coal
assets
to
a
majority
company
in
january
anglo
american
will
continue
to
export
coal
from
south
africa
but
it
will
no
longer
be
a
participant
in
supplying
the
domestic
market
which
is
dominated
by
the
state
power
utility
eskom
perhaps
it
s
not
surprising
that
the
two
major
coal
asset
sales
this
year
are
taking
place
in
south
africa
given
the
ongoing
dispute
between
the
government
and
the
mining
industry
over
a
new
mining
charter
and
the
requirements
to
increase
the
participation
of
black
investors
but
rio
tinto
also
decided
to
exit
its
australian
coal
business
selling
out
to
yancoal
australia
and
glencore
if
there
is
a
trend
at
play
here
it
s
that
diversified
miners
are
the
ones
most
likely
to
exit
coal
and
some
have
cited
the
risks
of
being
in
an
increasingly
unpopular
business
activists
and
other
investors
are
ramping
up
pressure
on
fund
managers
and
sovereign
wealth
funds
to
divest
from
companies
that
are
in
coal
given
coal
was
a
tiny
part
of
rio
s
business
exiting
the
industry
makes
sense
especially
if
you
can
then
tout
yourself
as
a
miner
of
metals
that
will
be
part
of
the
electric
vehicle
and
battery
revolution
the
other
choice
is
to
stay
in
coal
and
try
to
mitigate
any
public
backlash
bhp
and
its
alliance
partner
mitsubishi
are
the
world
s
largest
exporters
of
coking
coal
used
to
make
steel
and
there
are
no
signs
that
the
miner
intends
to
exit
the
business
same
goes
for
glencore
and
both
these
companies
are
probably
calculating
that
the
monetary
rewards
from
coal
still
outweigh
any
public
backlash
benjamin
sporton
chief
executive
of
industry
group
the
world
coal
association
told
reuters
in
an
interview
on
monday
that
there
was
a
positive
mood
among
many
coal
miners
while
sporton
said
coal
producers
acknowledge
that
the
market
is
shrinking
in
europe
and
faces
a
huge
challenge
from
cheap
natural
gas
in
the
united
states
asia
is
presenting
good
opportunities
our
membership
see
a
strong
future
in
asia
he
said
citing
expectations
that
china
and
india
will
remain
major
importers
of
both
thermal
and
coking
coal
while
demand
will
also
be
boosted
by
newer
consumers
in
asia
such
as
vietnam
and
pakistan
the
absence
of
major
new
coal
mines
and
indonesia
reducing
exports
to
fuel
domestic
demand
also
means
that
supply
to
seaborne
markets
is
likely
to
be
constrained
in
coming
years
even
if
there
is
a
slowdown
in
the
construction
of
new
generators
the
reality
for
many
existing
coal
miners
is
that
conditions
now
are
as
good
as
they
have
been
in
living
memory
the
price
of
thermal
coal
is
strong
with
the
asian
thermal
benchmark
newcastle
weekly
index
ending
on
at
a
tonne
the
highest
in
six
years
costs
are
also
down
with
the
industry
having
cut
every
sliver
of
fat
during
the
five
years
of
declining
prices
from
to
an
example
of
the
strong
conditions
for
coal
miners
is
australia
s
whitehaven
coal
which
on
reported
that
its
underlying
profit
rose
by
about
percent
to
a
million
million
it
also
paid
a
dividend
for
the
first
time
since
for
coal
miners
who
can
take
the
heat
of
the
public
opinion
kitchen
these
are
good
times
for
those
who
no
longer
see
coal
as
part
of
the
future
they
can
sell
out
at
prices
higher
than
what
they
might
have
expected
a
few
years
and
at
the
same
time
hopefully
gain
some
credibility
