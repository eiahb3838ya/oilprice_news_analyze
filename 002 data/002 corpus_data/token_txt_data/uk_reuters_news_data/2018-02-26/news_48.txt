a
consortium
including
japan
s
jera
and
marubeni
corp
is
aiming
to
ship
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
to
australia
s
east
coast
looking
to
supply
industrial
gas
users
and
possibly
a
new
power
plant
the
group
said
on
monday
this
is
the
second
proposed
lng
import
terminal
for
australia
the
world
s
lng
exporter
as
the
country
grapples
with
a
supply
gap
at
a
time
when
its
gas
producers
have
locked
in
contracts
to
sell
lng
to
japan
china
and
south
korea
a
final
investment
decision
is
expected
this
year
on
the
project
to
import
up
to
around
million
tonnes
a
year
of
lng
starting
in
james
baulderstone
who
is
leading
the
australian
industrial
energy
group
told
reuters
this
market
is
in
quite
desperate
need
for
more
gas
to
come
in
said
baulderstone
a
former
santos
ltd
executive
pointing
to
soaring
energy
prices
the
lng
receiving
terminal
would
be
able
to
meet
up
to
of
the
gas
needs
of
australia
s
most
populous
state
new
south
wales
where
manufacturers
like
bluescope
steel
and
orica
have
major
operations
baulderstone
said
the
consortium
would
probably
charter
an
existing
lng
import
vessel
at
an
estimated
cost
of
around
million
to
million
a
year
rather
than
building
a
new
floating
storage
and
regasification
unit
fsru
that
is
a
fraction
of
the
billions
of
dollars
that
would
be
needed
to
develop
a
new
gas
field
and
pipelines
to
supply
the
equivalent
volume
of
gas
petajoules
a
year
the
efficiency
of
capital
is
extraordinary
because
you
don
t
have
to
spend
that
much
capital
to
effectively
charter
a
boat
and
connect
it
to
the
existing
east
coast
grid
he
said
the
proposed
new
lng
import
terminal
would
be
located
at
either
port
botany
port
kembla
and
newcastle
all
of
which
are
close
to
existing
gas
pipelines
helping
to
keep
down
costs
australian
industrial
energy
s
investors
as
first
reported
by
the
australian
financial
review
are
mining
billionaire
andrew
forrest
s
squadron
energy
marubeni
and
jera
the
world
s
biggest
lng
buyer
which
is
a
joint
venture
of
tokyo
electric
power
co
and
chubu
electric
power
marubeni
and
jera
believe
that
this
project
can
be
completed
and
commence
the
supply
of
lng
to
new
south
wales
in
a
timely
manner
the
japanese
companies
said
in
a
statement
they
said
they
would
work
with
squadron
on
the
feasibility
study
including
marketing
to
potential
customers
and
tapping
jera
s
global
network
to
line
up
lng
supply
baulderstone
and
the
companies
declined
to
disclose
their
respective
stakes
in
the
consortium
general
electric
co
is
providing
technical
support
and
design
services
for
development
and
construction
of
a
power
plant
australia
s
top
power
generator
agl
energy
is
also
considering
building
an
lng
import
terminal
off
neighbouring
state
of
victoria
to
bring
in
up
to
million
tonnes
a
year
but
that
would
mostly
meet
its
own
needs
supplying
its
power
stations
and
households
while
lng
is
cheap
at
the
moment
prices
are
expected
to
rise
in
the
early
which
could
make
it
difficult
to
justify
imports
to
australia
said
saul
kavonic
an
analyst
at
consultants
wood
mackenzie
the
economic
case
for
australian
lng
imports
remains
marginal
at
best
and
is
not
guaranteed
to
happen
