reuters
mexico
and
canada
aim
to
finish
reworking
less
contentious
chapters
of
the
nafta
trade
deal
with
the
united
states
in
new
talks
that
began
on
sunday
hoping
to
clear
the
path
for
a
breakthrough
on
the
toughest
issues
before
upcoming
elections
in
six
months
negotiators
have
made
progress
on
the
technical
details
of
a
revamped
north
american
free
trade
agreement
but
made
little
advance
on
strong
demands
for
change
made
by
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
ranging
from
calls
for
major
changes
to
automotive
content
rules
and
dispute
resolution
mechanisms
to
imposing
a
clause
that
could
automatically
kill
nafta
after
five
years
the
chief
stumbling
blocks
laid
by
the
white
house
look
unlikely
to
be
removed
in
the
latest
mexico
city
round
officials
said
trump
frequently
threatens
to
walk
away
from
nafta
unless
big
changes
are
made
to
a
pact
he
blames
for
manufacturing
job
losses
i
think
there
s
going
to
be
major
progress
on
the
technical
issues
and
major
obstacles
on
the
critical
issues

head
of
the
mexico
s
national
agricultural
council
farm
lobby
said
of
the
talks
running
until
march
once
agreement
is
reached
on
technical
chapters
such
as
enterprises
barriers
to
trade
and
about
percent
of
the
modernized
accord
would
eventually
be
left
over
for
political
leaders
to
work
out
de
la
vega
estimated
a
schedule
for
the
latest
round
showed
that
the
discussions
for
the
first
three
days
would
include
rules
of
origin
an
issue
at
the
heart
of
the
trump
administration
s
demand
to
raise
the
amount
of
auto
content
sourced
from
the
nafta
region
under
nafta
at
least
percent
of
the
net
cost
of
a
passenger
car
or
light
truck
must
originate
in
the
region
to
avoid
tariffs
trump
wants
the
threshold
raised
to
percent
you
can
t
have
a
successful
negotiation
if
there
s
no
change
to
the
rules
of
origin
said
a
mexican
official
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
adding
it
won
t
be
percent
we
re
not
sure
what
the
number
is
going
to
mexican
economy
minister
ildefonso
guajardo
has
said
his
negotiating
team
aims
to
present
a
proposal
on
rules
of
origin
although
he
has
not
provided
details
on
sunday
evening
the
mexican
official
told
reuters
we
don
t
have
a
counterproposal
any
final
agreement
would
need
to
be
reached
between
trump
and
leaders
in
the
united
states
who
oversee
the
nafta
region
an
industry
source
close
to
the
process
said
the
north
american
auto
industry
has
pushed
back
against
trump
s
demands
arguing
they
would
damage
competitiveness
and
regional
supply
chains
mexico
aims
to
build
on
the
previous
round
in
montreal
when
canada
floated
proposals
to
address
demands
including
one
to
include
costs
for
engineering
research
and
development
and
other
items
in
the
total
value
of
an
auto
the
schedule
showed
that
several
chapters
that
negotiators
have
signaled
are
close
to
concluding
including
telecommunications
and
energy
are
up
for
discussion
toward
the
end
of
the
round
financial
services
will
last
for
three
days
the
latest
round
comes
amid
between
washington
and
ottawa
and
growing
if
cautious
optimism
in
mexico
that
the
trade
agreement
will
remain
talks
are
running
behind
schedule
and
some
officials
believe
the
longer
they
last
the
less
likely
it
is
that
trump
will
dump
nafta
negotiators
had
wanted
to
wrap
up
talks
by
march
to
avoid
them
being
politicized
by
mexico
s
july
presidential
election
congressional
elections
in
november
could
also
complicate
the
talks
but
officials
have
raised
the
possibility
that
they
will
run
past
mexico
s
vote
and
some
said
they
could
continue
at
a
technical
level
for
several
months
if
necessary
a
official
said
there
has
never
been
a
hard
deadline
and
belief
is
growing
among
mexicans
following
the
process
that
lobbying
efforts
by
business
leaders
and
politicians
to
preserve
nafta
have
been
gaining
traction
the
office
of
minnesota
governor
mark
dayton
on
friday
published
a
letter
sent
this
month
to
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
in
which
he
urged
him
to
preserve
and
expand
market
access
under
nafta
and
build
on
existing
ties
while
pledging
to
stay
in
the
talks
canada
s
chief
negotiator
steve
verheul
struck
a
downbeat
tone
last
week
telling
a
business
audience
there
are
large
gaps
between
what
we
re
trying
to
achieve
and
what
