investor
skittishness
about
the
pace
of
fed
interest
rate
hikes
has
weighed
on
stock
markets
worldwide

most
traders
believe
powell
will
stay

gradually
raise
interest
rates
despite
indications
inflation
is
perking
up

some
talk
of
powell
being
a
little
more
open
to
tolerating
inflation

traded
near
ahead
of
a
slew
of
economic
data
and
events
this

powell
s
testimony

powell
suggests
