toyota pursues petrol but sees electric potential in new technology
tokyo
reuters
toyota
motor
corp
stuck
to
its
commitment
to
improving
petrol
engines
on
monday
with
new
powertrain
units
while
flagging
technologies
which
could
find
their
way
into
electric
vehicles
evs
and
hydrogen
fuel
cell
vehicles
fcvs
the
japanese
automaker
plans
to
keep
refining
its
petrol
engines
and
the
hybrid
technology
it
pioneered
two
decades
ago
while
also
developing
battery
operated
cars
as
tightening
global
emissions
rules
drive
a
race
for
affordable
evs
as
high
battery
prices
and
range
limitations
restrain
ev
hybrids
and
hybrids
would
be
dominant
in
coming
years
mitsumasa
yamagata
chief
engineer
at
toyota
s
power
train
product
planning
division
said
cars
using
petrol
engines
in
some
form
would
still
account
for
around
percent
of
all
vehicles
by
he
added
developing
the
most
powertrains
using
petrol
engines
and
hybrid
systems
will
be
the
best
way
to
have
an
impact
on
reducing
emissions
and
we
remain
committed
to
this
he
said
at
a
briefing
on
toyota
s
new
litre
petrol
engine
and
hybrid
systems
which
can
improve
fuel
economy
by
percent
and
percent
respectively
over
its
current
systems
at
the
same
time
we
will
be
able
to
use
the
technology
developed
for
these
powertrains
in
evs
and
already
lagging
nissan
motor
co
general
motors
and
bmw
in
bringing
a
ev
to
market
toyota
has
ramped
up
its
ev
development
in
the
last
year
or
so
pledging
to
add
more
than
ev
models
to
its
product
in
the
early
after
long
touting
a
strategy
focusing
mainly
on
hybrids
and
fcvs
last
week
it
announced
it
had
developed
magnets
containing
fewer
rare
earth
metals
which
can
be
used
in
evs
while
it
has
also
partnered
up
with
panasonic
corp
to
develop
ev
batteries
yamagata
said
that
components
for
petrol
vehicles
could
also
be
used
in
evs
including
a
new
launch
gear
used
in
toyota
s
continuously
variable
transmission
unveiled
on
monday
which
works
with
a
smaller
belt
drive
to
enable
smoother
more
efficient
initial
acceleration
and
final
deceleration
industry
experts
anticipate
that
of
evs
will
pick
up
faster
than
toyota
expects
as
decreasing
battery
costs
result
in
a
cost
parity
between
evs
and
cars
around
but
some
say
that
it
could
leverage
its
lead
in
hybrid
technology
to
help
stay
competitive
during
this
transition
toyota
has
been
developing
its
hybrid
technology
since
the
and
has
been
improving
it
all
along
this
is
complex
technology
which
would
take
a
lot
of
effort
for
others
to
develop
originally
