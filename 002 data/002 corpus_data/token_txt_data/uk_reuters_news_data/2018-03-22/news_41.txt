march
reuters
the
main
coal
miners
union
is
set
to
endorse
two
democrats
running
for
congress
in
west
virginia
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
on
thursday
a
boost
for
democrats
trying
to
win
over
a
constituency
that
voted
heavily
for
republican
donald
trump
in
the
united
mine
workers
of
america
on
friday
will
endorse
richard
ojeda
for
representative
in
the
state
s
third
district
as
well
as
incumbent
senator
joe
manchin
a
democrat
and
former
west
virginia
governor
the
sources
said
they
asked
not
to
be
named
as
they
were
discussing
a
confidential
matter
the
union
sees
ojeda
and
manchin
as
supportive
of
major
issues
facing
coal
miners
particularly
efforts
to
preserve
their
pensions
the
sources
said
in
addition
neither
candidate
has
fully
embraced
the
democratic
party
s
push
for
climate
regulation
a
sticking
point
for
miners
trump
s
white
house
win
in
was
due
in
part
to
his
promise
to
revive
the
ailing
coal
industry
which
has
lost
more
than
percent
of
its
work
force
in
less
than
a
decade
by
rolling
back
environmental
regulation
while
his
administration
has
chipped
away
at
regulations
the
coal
sector
remains
in
the
doldrums
under
pressure
from
cheaper
and
cleaner
natural
gas
more
than
a
year
into
trump
s
presidency
republican
control
of
congress
will
be
at
stake
in
midterm
elections
in
november
when
all
seats
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
of
the
senate
seats
will
be
up
for
grabs
the
endorsements
in
west
virginia
this
week
follow
the
union
s
support
for
conor
lamb
in
a
special
election
for
a
house
seat
in
pennsylvania
that
he
won
earlier
this
month
political
observers
have
said
that
upset
could
be
a
bellwether
for
future
races
in
areas
that
had
supported
trump
the
umwa
had
organized
a
rally
canvassing
and
phone
bank
operations
for
lamb
umwa
president
cecil
roberts
told
reuters
that
lamb
a
former
marine
who
wore
work
boots
while
talking
with
voters
won
because
he
focused
on
protecting
miners
pensions
which
are
at
risk
of
insolvency
due
to
bankruptcies
and
mine
closures
that
s
how
conor
lamb
was
able
to
swing
those
voters
to
his
side
roberts
said
roberts
said
ojeda
a
former
army
paratrooper
who
comes
from
a
long
line
of
coal
miners
reminded
him
of
lamb
the
umwa
has
endorsed
about
three
more
republicans
than
democrats
in
house
races
so
far
in
this
cycle
but
the
tally
will
likely
become
evenly
split
between
the
two
parties
in
the
coming
months
as
the
union
looks
to
races
in
ohio
colorado
and
arizona
said
one
of
the
sources
it
is
unclear
how
much
the
endorsements
will
help
the
candidates
but
miners
are
seen
as
an
influential
political
constituency
particularly
in
appalachia
the
epicenter
of
the
coal
industry
ojeda
currently
a
state
senator
in
west
virginia
who
is
seen
as
a
favorite
in
a
democratic
primary
to
pick
the
party
s
candidate
on
may
faces
a
tough
election
battle
in
his
heavily
republican
southern
west
virginia
district
trump
won
the
district
by
percentage
points
against
his
democratic
rival
hillary
clinton
in
and
ojeda
himself
voted
for
trump
ojeda
did
not
comment
about
the
coming
endorsement
but
said
in
an
brief
interview
i
m
going
to
fist
fight
for
workers
who
have
been
ojeda
has
said
he
supports
more
coal
mining
especially
to
fuel
steel
furnaces
but
also
backs
biofuels
solar
and
wind
power
in
the
umwa
endorsed
a
republican
in
ojeda
s
district
evan
jenkins
who
is
retiring
to
run
for
the
senate
manchin
meanwhile
has
long
been
the
democratic
party
s
strongest
supporter
of
coal
interests
advocating
more
production
and
backing
controversial
subsidy
proposals
but
several
republicans
are
lining
up
against
him
in
the
midterm
elections
among
them
is
don
blankenship
a
former
coal
company
executive
who
served
a
prison
sentence
for
conspiring
to
violate
safety
standards
at
the
upper
big
branch
mine
where
miners
died
in
manchin
s
office
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
the
coming
endorsement
the
democratic
national
committee
is
not
endorsing
candidates
before
the
primary
votes
but
the
organization
likes
what
it
sees
in
coal
country
focusing
on
middle
class
families
on
american
workers
in
these
appalachian
and
more
rural
areas
is
something
that
is
successful
for
democratic
candidates
to
run
on
