duesseldorf
march
reuters
a
german
court
on
thursday
said
the
energy
regulator
would
damage
the
profits
of
gas
and
power
grid
operators
by
cutting
the
returns
on
their
network
investments
too
severely
the
higher
regional
court
in
duesseldorf
upheld
complaints
by
network
companies
against
the
plan
in
a
decision
which
can
be
appealed
against
within
one
month
the
return
on
equity
for
operators
of
gas
and
power
grids
is
set
by
germany
s
federal
network
agency
bnetza
which
plans
to
cut
the
return
to
percent
from
percent
for
new
networks
and
to
percent
from
percent
for
old
grids
grid
operators
including
amprion
in
which
rwe
holds
a
minority
stake
and
which
owned

reversed
the
new
rates
set
for
five
years
are
to
kick
in
from
for

grids
and
from
for
power
networks
with
a
one
percentage
point
change
cutting
sales
by
an
estimated
billion
euros
bnetza
must
weigh
the
potential
welfare
of
consumers
for
whom
the
grid
fees
constitute
around
a
quarter
of
retail
bills
against
the
need
to
be
fair
to
operators
