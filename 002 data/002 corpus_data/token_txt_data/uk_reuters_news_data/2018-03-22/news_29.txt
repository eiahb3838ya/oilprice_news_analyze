reuters
on
the
surface
the
kazakh
town
of
aksu
looks
like
a
communist
stereotype
its
metals
factory
is
the
biggest
in
the
world
and
for
generations
it
has
provided
residents
with
employment
healthcare
education
and
leisure
but
there
s
a
crucial
difference
the
eurasian
resources
group
factory
is
controlled
by
three
billionaires
and
though
the
kazakh
government
has
a
stake
it
s
a
far
cry
from
the
communist
model
of
ownership
by
the
proletariat
the
trio
are
alexander
machkevich
alijan
ibragimov
and
patokh
chodiev
and
many
kazakhs
see
them
as
oligarchs
close
to
president
nursultan
nazarbayev
who
has
ruled
since
nazarbayev
a
former
soviet
apparatchik
wields
sweeping
power
and
parliament
is
devoid
of
opposition
a
political
party
bankrolled
by
erg
s
cofounders
was
founded
in
and
merged
with
the
president
s
nur
otan
party
in
none
of
the
three
billionaires
are
native
kazakhs
though
all
are
from
central
asia
they
started
their
careers
as
commodities
traders
and
took
over
kazakh
mining
and
metals
assets
during
privatisation
these
days
one
in
five
of
aksu
s
residents
works
at
the
factory
and
it
is
a
model
for
the
country
s
capitalism
under
which
tycoons
are
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
mono
towns
that
depend
on
their
business
founded
in
the
century
as
a
river
wharf
for
nearby
coal
deposits
in
northeastern
kazakhstan
aksu
became
an
industrial
hub
in
the
when
soviet
planners
designated
it
as
a
location
for
a
power
plant
and
a
ferroalloys
smelter
both
the
plant
and
the
smelter
were
privative
in
the
after
kazakhstan
gained
independence
from
the
soviet
union
and
became
part
of
erg
s
central
asian
mining
and
metals
assets
petr
smotrich
has
worked
as
a
furnace
operator
at
the
smelter
for
years
he
met
his
wife
galiya
there
she
works
as
an
administrator
and
their
son
dmitry
and
daughter
irina
also
work
at
the
same
smelter
the
smelter
keeps
working
and
therefore
we
have
confidence
in
our
future
he
says
ferroalloys
are
used
in
steelmaking
and
the
aksu
ferroalloys
plant
as
the
smelter
is
known
officially
sells
the
bulk
of
its
products
to
china
japan
and
russia
the
smelter
avoided
the
fate
of
many
industrial
giants
in
the
that
went
bankrupt
and
laid
off
staff
though
at
one
point
it
reduced
workers
shifts
to
three
per
week
smotrich
says
the
town
has
avoided
the
collapse
too
smotrich
said
there
is
a
street
gym
in
every
yard
smotrich
says
erg
which
is
boosting
exports
of
ferroalloys
says
it
has
spent
hundreds
of
millions
of
tenge
currency
or
millions
of
dollars
on
social
infrastructure
such
as
a
stadium
and
a
swimming
pool
the
town
also
has
a
trade
school
so
aksu
residents
can
get
education
and
find
work
without
ever
leaving
the
only
thing
lacking
is
entertainment
and
those
looking
for
night
clubs
or
cinemas
travel
km
miles
to
regional
centre
pavlodar
smotrich
says
others
spend
their
free
time
fishing
on
the
renovated
embankment
on
the
irtysh
river
unemployment
in
aksu
is
just
percent
well
below
the
percent
national
average
and
crime
locals
say
is
almost
nonexistent
still
smotrich
says
he
is
not
sure
whether
his
granddaughter
will
continue
the
metalworker
dynasty
i
did
nudge
my
children
in
that
direction
but
she
will
decide
for
herself
