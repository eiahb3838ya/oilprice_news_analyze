was
on
the
defensive
on
thursday
after

its
largest
loss
in
two
months
when
the

turned
out
to
be
less
hawkish
than

about
a

the
federal

raised
interest
rates
on
wednesday
and
forecast
two
more
hikes
for
in
its
first
policy
meeting
under
new
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
given
some
investors
had
expected
it
to
project
three
more
rate
hikes
the
guidance
was
perceived
by
some
as
less
hawkish
than
anticipated
a
positive
factor
for
risk
assets
in
general
though
analysts
noted
the
fed
was
upbeat
on
the
economy
on
the
whole
they
also
forecast
three
hikes
next
year
and
two
more
