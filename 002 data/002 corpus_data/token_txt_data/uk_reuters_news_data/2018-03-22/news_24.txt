as

took

rally

oil
prices
have
risen
in
the

unexpected
drop
in
crude
inventories
a
drop
in

on

weighed
on

that

impose

the
oil
derivatives
market
shows
most
activity
in
the
past
week
has
centred
around
options
to
buy
known
as
call
options
which
give
the
holder
the
possibility
to
purchase
oil
at
a
given
price
by
a
certain
date
call
options
to
buy
oil
at
a
barrel
by
the
end
of
next
month
have
changed
hands
more
often
in
the
past
week
than
options
at
any
other
price
level
the
energy
information
administration
said
on
wednesday
that
crude
inventories
fell
million
barrels
last
week
compared
with
analysts
expectations
for
an
increase
of
million
barrels
the
decline
was
driven
by
lower
crude
imports
and
higher
refinery
runs
but
the
confident
mood
in
the
oil
market
has
been
tempered
by
crude
production
which
climbed
to
a
record
million
barrels
per
day
last
week
putting
output
ahead
of
saudi
arabia
and
closing
in
on
russia
s
million
bpd
we
are
still
viewing
rapidly
rising
production
into
record
high
territory
as
a
latent
bearish
consideration
that
will
only
be
accentuated
by
this
renewed
high
pricing
environment
jim
ritterbusch
president
of
ritterbusch
and
associates
said
in
a
note
production
growth
has
partly
been
countered
by
the
deal
to
cut
output
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
russia
and
their
allies
the
agreement
has
run
since
the
start
of
and
is
due
to
expire
at
the
end
of
crude
s
discount
to
brent
widened
to
as
much
as
a
barrel
on
thursday
its
biggest
discount
since
late
january
