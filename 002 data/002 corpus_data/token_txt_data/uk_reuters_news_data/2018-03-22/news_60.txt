leading
diabetes
drugmaker
novo
nordisk
is
expected
to
pick
former
oil
boss
helge
lund
as
its
new
chairman
as
the
company
contends
with
increasing
price
pressure
and
seeks
new
acquisitions
to
broaden
its
blood
products
the
man
dubbed
by
some
as
norway
s
mr
oil
because
of
his
extensive
career
in
the
oil
and
gas
industry
may
be
more
of
an
expert
in
hydrocarbons
than
insulin
but
his
merger
and
acquisitions
experience
is
the
big
draw
for
the
danish
pharmaceuticals
company
novo
is
on
the
hunt
for
promising
assets
to
boost
its
struggling
blood
products
business
after
it
lost
out
to
french
rival
sanofi
in
the
chase
for
belgian
biotech
company
ablynx
in
late
january
novo
said
it
dropped
its
pursuit
of
ablynx
which
is
developing
an
experimental
drug
for
a
rare
blood
disorder
because
it
could
not
justify
the
high
price
required
to
beat
sanofi
s
offer
lund
is
expected
to
be
appointed
at
novo
s
annual
general
meeting
on
thursday
we
are
about
to
see
novo
take
on
a
role
that
we
have
not
seen
before
and
therefore
it
is
important
to
have
a
chairman
with
experience
of
mergers
and
acquisitions
said
sydbank
analyst
soren
lontoft
hansen
lund
oversaw
kvaerner
s
merger
with
aker
maritime
he
later
became
head
of
statoil
where
he
was
in
charge
during
the
oil
major
s
billion
acquisition
of
norsk
hydro
s
petroleum
business
in
his
next
role
as
chief
executive
of
bg
group
lund
went
from
being
the
guy
doing
the
buying
to
being
bought
as
royal
dutch
shell
s
takeover
of
the
british
oil
and
gas
company
was
announced
only
two
months
after
he
started
the
job
the
old
norwegian
also
a
passionate
fan
of
english
soccer
club
arsenal
will
replace
goran
ando
who
steps
down
after
five
years
in
the
job
another
crucial
task
for
the
new
chairman
will
be
to
retain
investor
trust
after
the
company
cut
its
growth
revenue
outlook
twice
within
nine
months
in
novo
now
has
a
target
of
percent
revenue
growth
a
far
cry
from
the
from
the
growth
achieved
in
and
reflecting
a
more
challenging
diabetes
market
amid
increased
competition
and
price
erosion
helge
is
very
strong
strategically
and
very
oriented
towards
growth
said
former
statoil
chairman
svein
rennemo
who
worked
closely
with
lund
for
several
years
lund
will
work
with
a
relatively
new
management
team
including
chief
executive
lars
fruergaard
jorgensen
who
started
last
year
and
karsten
munk
knudsen
who
became
finance
chief
last
month
