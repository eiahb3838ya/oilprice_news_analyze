up
by

last
year
and
the
situation
is
getting
worse

fao
the

and
the
international

research
institute
we
are
clearly
seeing
a
trend
now
from
million
to
million
from
to
million
people
literally
marching
to
the
brink
of
starvation
around
the
world
said
david
beasley
wfp
s
executive
director
we
will
never
address
the
issues
of
the
day
until
we
end
some
of
these
conflicts
he
added
at
the
report
s
launch
the
fsin
report
said
the
rising
numbers
in
were
largely
due
to
new
or
intensified
conflicts
in
myanmar
nigeria
the
democratic
republic
of
congo
south
sudan
and
yemen
in
conflict
will
remain
a
primary
driver
of
food
security
it
said
while
severe
dry
weather
is
expected
to
affect
crop
and
livestock
production
and
worsen
hunger
in
many
parts
of
africa
yemen
where
a
proxy
war
between
a
military
coalition
and
the
houthi
movement
has
displaced
more
than
million
people
since
would
remain
the
world
s
most
concerning
food
crisis
the
report
said
it
also
singled
out
eritrea
north
korea
and
venezuela
as
places
of
concern
but
said
a
lack
of
data
made
it
difficult
to
estimate
the
number
of
people
left
hungry
the
analysis
showed
the
situation
could
worsen
in
in
at
least
three
or
four
countries

senior

analyst
at
the

told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
fsin
uses
a
five
phase
scale
with
the
third
level
classified
as
crisis
fourth
as
emergency
and
fifth
as
in
south
sudan
we
all
applaud
ourselves
because
we
avoided
famine
last
year
but
the
figures
today
tell
us
we
might
have
famine
in
south
sudan
in
the
next
few
months
and
this
can
also
apply
to
other
countries
