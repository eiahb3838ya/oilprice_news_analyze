brent

spreads
have
risen
significantly
over
the
last

erasing
an
earlier
decline
and
indicating
traders
have
become
more
bullish
about
the
outlook
for
the

later

the

spread
for

the

calendar
spreads
reflect
expectations
about
the
balance
between
supply
and
demand
in
the
physical
market
and
are
seen
by
many
traders
and
investors
as
a
more
useful
signal
than
spot
prices
the
relationship
between
spreads
and
inventories
was
identified
by

holbrook
working
in
the
grain
market
price
relations
between
july
and
september
wheat
futures
at
chicago
since

but
similar
relationships
between

and

exist
in
other
commodities
including
brent

spreads
are
normally
expressed
as
the
price
of
the
nearer
futures
contract
minus
the
price
of
the
contract
with
longer
until
expiry
negative
spreads
known
as
contango
when
the
price
of
the
nearby
contract
is
below
the
one
are
correlated
with
high
and
rising
inventories
when
production
exceeds
consumption
positive
spreads
termed
backwardation
when
the
price
of
the
nearby
contract
is
above
the
one
are
correlated
with
low
and
falling
inventories
when
production
falls
short
of
consumption
for
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
brent
crude
futures
have
cycled
between
contango
and
backwardation
as
the
global
oil
market
has
alternated
between
periods
of
and
brent
calendar
spreads
have
been
one
of
the
most
useful
and
reliable
indicators
of
the
changing
balance
in
the
global
oil
market
the
brent
spreads
have
been
gradually
moving
from
contango
to
backwardation
since
early
or
early
as
the
oil
market
has
gradually
rebalanced
after
the
slump
in
recently
however
the
calendar
spreads
appeared
to
peak
and
start
softening
coinciding
with
a
downturn
in
spot
prices
traders
and
investors
seemed
to
react
to
an
unexpected
surge
in
crude
and
condensates
output
from
shale
producers
forecasts
showed
additional
production
from
the
united
states
as
well
as
brazil
canada
and
norway
would
be
more
than
enough
to
meet
the
increase
in
oil
consumption
this
year
hedge
funds
and
other
financial
investors
have
been
gradually
reducing
their
bullish
positions
in
crude
oil
over
the
last
seven
weeks
intensifying
the
downward
pressure
on
spreads
and
spot
prices
but
in
the
last
week
both
spreads
and
spot
prices
have
rallied
sharply
regaining
most
of
the
ground
lost
during
february
and
march
suggesting
a
return
to
a
more
bullish
sentiment
or
at
least
a
tempering
of
bearishness
oil
prices
and
spreads
do
not
rise
and
fall
in
straight
lines
or
even
in
a
simple
cyclical
pattern
in
addition
to
the
main
cycle
there
are
smaller
epicycles
operating
at
various
from
months
to
weeks
days
or
even
minutes
and
seconds
the
weakening
of
the
spread
since
early
february
appears
to
have
been
one
of
those
epicycles
within
the
framework
of
a
larger
cyclical
upswing
but
that
epicycle
seems
to
have
reversed
course
over
the
last
week
the
reasons
are
not
entirely
clear
but
could
include
rising
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
iran
opec
discussions
to
tighten
its
inventory
target
or
another
factor
entirely
some
epicycles
arise
from
within
the
market
itself
rather
than
as
a
result
of
fundamental
external
factors
as
prices
move
in
response
to
the
accumulation
and
liquidation
of
positions
by
traders
the
bigger
question
is
whether
the
oil
market
is
still
tightening
or
whether
the
rise
in
prices
since
june
has
already
done
enough
to
ensure
supply
will
match
demand
