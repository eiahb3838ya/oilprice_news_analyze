saudi arabia has options if u.s. walks from nuclear power deal -minister
washington
reuters
saudi
arabia
has
international
partners
it
can
work
with
if
the
united
states
walks
away
from
a
potential
deal
on
nuclear
power
technology
over
concerns
about
nuclear
proliferation
khalid
the
kingdom
s
energy
minister
said
in
an
interview
on
thursday
if
the
is
not
with
us
they
will
lose
the
opportunity
to
influence
the
programme
in
a
positive
way
falih
said
after
he
and
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
met
this
week
with
president
donald
trump
energy
secretary
rick
perry
and
other
officials
on
a
range
of
issues
perry
has
been
quietly
working
with
saudi
arabia
on
a
civilian
nuclear
agreement
that
could
allow
the
kingdom
to
enrich
uranium
and
reprocess
plutonium
technologies
that
nonproliferation
advocates
worry
could
one
day
be
covertly
altered
to
produce
fissile
material
for
nuclear
weapons
the
kingdom
is
also
in
talks
with
companies
from
russia
china
south
korea
and
other
countries
as
the
race
to
build
two
reactors
in
saudi
arabia
heats
up
saudi
arabia
has
said
it
needs
nuclear
power
to
move
away
from
burning
crude
oil
to
generate
electricity
and
to
diversify
its
economy
earlier
this
month
its
cabinet
approved
a
national
policy
programme
that
limits
nuclear
activities
to
peaceful
purposes
perry
hopes
saudi
arabia
will
buy
nuclear
power
technology
from
companies
including
westinghouse
which
went
into
chapter
bankruptcy
this
year
and
abandoned
plans
to
build
two
advanced
reactors
in
the
united
states
but
salman
raised
concerns
when
he
told
cbs
in
an
interview
on
sunday
that
the
kingdom
will
develop
nuclear
weapons
if
its
archrival
iran
does
so
some
members
of
the
congress
worry
the
trump
administration
is
moving
too
quickly
on
a
deal
that
could
relax
nonproliferation
standards
and
one
day
help
lead
to
a
nuclear
arms
race
across
the
middle
east
if
saudi
arabia
signs
a
deal
that
relaxes
the
safeguards
the
uae
could
be
free
to
break
its
own
deal
it
signed
with
washington
years
ago
and
enrich
uranium
the
uae
deal
contained
the
gold
standard
in
such
nuclear
agreements
because
it
contains
the
safeguards
on
wednesday
lawmakers
from
both
parties
in
the
house
introduced
a
bill
that
would
reform
law
to
ensure
that
partners
on
nuclear
energy
abandon
the
pursuit
of
enriching
uranium
and
reprocessing
plutonium
the
bill
would
also
harden
congressional
approval
of
civilian
nuclear
deals
falih
said
he
was
hopeful
for
a
deal
with
washington
it
will
be
natural
for
the
united
states
to
be
with
us
and
to
provide
us
not
only
with
technology
but
to
help
us
with
the
fuel
cycle
and
the
monitoring
and
make
sure
we
do
it
to
the
highest
but
the
kingdom
has
generous
uranium
resources
it
wants
to
develop
it
s
not
natural
for
us
to
bring
enriched
uranium
from
a
foreign
country
to
fuel
our
reactors
falih
said
the
irony
is
that
if
the
chooses
not
to
seal
a
deal
then
somebody
else
will
and
we
are
fortunate
to
have
many
other
alternative
sources
that
have
agreed
to
work
with
us
and
they
will
be
competing
for
our
programme
falih
said
in
that
case
the
will
not
have
a
seat
at
the
table
he
said
perry
stuck
a
similar
chord
in
comments
during
a
congressional
hearing
on
nuclear
deals
this
week
it
appears
to
me
either
russia
or
china
is
going
to
be
a
partner
in
building
civil
nuclear
capability
in
the
kingdom
of
saudi
arabia
if
the
united
states
does
not
some
nuclear
analysts
believe
it
is
unlikely
that
the
saudis
would
choose
to
work
with
russia
because
it
has
partnerships
with
nuclear
projects
in
iran
