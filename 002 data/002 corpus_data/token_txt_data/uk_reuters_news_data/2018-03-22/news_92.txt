geneva
reuters
the
united
states
did
not
fully
comply
with
a
ruling
against
its
tariffs
on
a
range
of
chinese
products
a
world
trade
organization
compliance
panel
said
in
a
ruling
on
wednesday
that
either
side
can
appeal
within
days
the
ruling
came
ahead
of
the
white
house
s
announcement
on
thursday
that
president
donald
trump
will
announce
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
aimed
at
curbing
theft
of
technology
the
move
is
expected
to
trigger
retaliation
from
beijing
and
stoke
fears
of
a
global
trade
war
china
went
to
the
wto
in
to
challenge
tariffs
on
chinese
exports
including
solar
panels
wind
towers
steel
cylinders
and
aluminium
extrusions
at
the
time
it
said
its
complaint
covered
an
annual
billion
in
exports
to
the
united
states
the
wto
panel
agreed
that
the
united
states
had
not
correctly
used
third
country
prices
to
assess
the
subsidies
but
supported
the
assertion
that
exporters
were
getting
subsidies
from
chinese
public
bodies
despite
beijing
s
assertions
to
the
contrary
china
s
commerce
ministry
said
late
on
wednesday
that
the
wto
ruling
showed
that
the
united
states
was
a
repeat
abuser
of
trade
remedy
measures
and
urged
it
to
take
immediate
action
to
correct
faulty
practices
if
china
s
complaint
survives
a
potential
appeal
it
would
move
a
step
closer
to
retaliatory
sanctions
on
trade
although
the
two
sides
would
first
have
to
settle
on
the
value
of
sanctions
which
would
involve
a
round
of
legal
argument
the
dispute
centred
on
investigations
carried
out
by
the
department
of
commerce
between
and
the
products
concerned
were
solar
panels
wind
towers
thermal

many
of
china
s
complaints
about
specific
investigations
were
rejected
in
the
panel
s
report
but
other
points
were
upheld
