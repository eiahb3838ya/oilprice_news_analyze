a
comfortable
consensus
is
emerging
in
the
iron
ore
market
that
china
s
vast
steel
industry
has
undergone
a
structural
change
that
has
resulted
in
quality
iron
ore
gaining
a
permanent
advantage
over
lower
grades
certainly
the
common
theme
of
presentations
at
this
week
s
global
iron
ore
and
steel
forecast
conference
in
perth
was
that
the
current
premium
of
ore
with
a
higher
iron
content
is
now
a
defining
characteristic
of
china
s
market
this
shift
matters
as
china
buys
about
of
global
seaborne
iron
ore
with
the
vast
majority
of
the
annual
demand
of
more
than
billion
tonnes
coming
from
australia
and
brazil
with
south
africa
a
distant
third
the
industry
benchmark
is
ore
with
an
iron
content
of
percent
a
quality
level
that
is
met
by
most
brazilian
ore
as
well
as
by
top
australian
miner
rio
tinto
bhp
billiton
australia
s
producer
comes
close
to
this
level
with
its
output
but
fortescue
metals
group
delivers
a
grade
closer
to
the
percent
level
china
s
switch
to
using
iron
ore
in
its
blast
furnaces
is
seemingly
built
around
three
main
factors
the
first
is
the
need
to
reduce
air
pollution
which
encourages
steel
mills
to
use
the
higher
grade
ores
as
they
require
less
coking
coal
in
order
to
be
turned
into
pig
iron
and
then
crude
steel
using
iron
ore
with
a
percent
iron
content
consumes
about
percent
less
coking
coal
than
using
percent
iron
ore
the
second
is
the
ongoing
rationalisation
of
the
steel
industry
with
capacity
closures
of
around
a
total
million
tonnes
being
achieved
in
and
up
to
million
tonnes
more
was
slated
to
be
shut
down
this
year
this
policy
is
aimed
at
eliminating
overcapacity
and
clearing
out
older
producers
thereby
boosting
the
profitability
of
the
remaining
steel
mills
the
policy
has
contributed
to
the
third
factor
driving
the
switch
to
higher
grade
ore
namely
that
mills
are
enjoying
strong
profit
margins
from
being
for
several
years
up
to
china
s
steel
producers
have
turned
strongly
profitable
in
recent
months
with
the
margin
on
benchmark
steel
rebar
around
a
tonne
according
to
s
p
global
platts
data
with
the
steel
futures
in
shanghai
currently
trading
around
the
equivalent
of
it
s
clear
that
steel
makers
can
afford
to
use
the
iron
ore
as
they
are
still
incentivised
to
maximise
output
to
capture
the
available
profit
if
the
current
market
consensus
is
correct
that
china
s
shift
to
higher
grade
iron
ore
is
structural
it
becomes
apparent
that
these
three
factors
will
also
have
to
be
structural
it
s
probably
fair
to
say
that
the
first
two
the
focus
on
reducing
pollution
and
the
rationalisation
of
capacity
appear
to
be
ongoing
policies
and
there
are
no
signs
that
they
will
be
relaxed
or
changed
in
any
shape
but
the
most
important
factor
is
the
profitability
of
steel
mills
and
this
is
far
from
guaranteed
the
return
to
profitability
was
driven
by
stimulus
spending
on
infrastructure
and
a
recovery
in
real
estate
investment
and
both
of
these
influences
may
be
waning
somewhat
this
isn
t
to
suggest
a
sharp
correction
is
looming
in
chinese
steel
demand
and
prices
but
at
the
same
time
constructing
a
case
for
sustaining
the
current
levels
of
robust
profits
is
quite
challenging
steel
is
a
cyclical
business
and
is
likely
to
remain
so
meaning
that
at
some
point
china
s
producers
will
once
again
face
a
margin
squeeze
when
that
happens
the
incentive
switches
to
use
the
lowest
cost
inputs
and
accept
a
reduction
in
volumes
from
the
blast
furnace
this
could
well
put
lower
grade
iron
ore
back
in
play
and
shrink
the
current
wide
margins
the
spot
price
in
china
of
percent
iron
ore
as
assessed
by
metal
bulletin
was
at
a
tonne
on
wednesday
the
assessment
for
the
percent
grade
was
a
tonne
this
makes
the
lower
grade
ore
about
percent
cheaper
and
this
has
widened
from
the
percent
gap
that
prevailed
at
the
end
of
the
current
gap
is
clearly
seen
by
many
in
the
industry
as
the
new
normal
and
it
s
likely
to
persist
as
long
as
china
s
steel
mills
enjoy
the
type
of
profits
they
are
getting
currently
but
it
may
be
a
touch
too
soon
to
say
that
this
is
a
sustained
structural
change
that
can
not
be
reversed
if
market
circumstances
change
as
they
inevitably
will
