update 2-global carbon emissions hit record high in 2017
london
reuters
global
carbon
emissions
rose
to
a
historic
high
of
gigatons
last
year
after
three
years
of
being
flat
due
to
higher
energy
demand
and
the
slowing
of
energy
efficiency
improvements
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
global
energy
demand
rose
by
percent
last
year
to
million
tonnes
of
oil
equivalent
more
than
twice
the
previous
year
s
rate
boosted
by
strong
economic
growth
according
to
preliminary
estimates
from
the
iea
energy
demand
rose
by
percent
in
and
percent
on
average
over
the
previous
five
years
over
percent
of
global
energy
demand
growth
was
met
by
oil
natural
gas
and
coal
while
renewables
accounted
for
almost
all
of
the
rest
the
iea
said
in
a
report
improvements
in
energy
efficiency
slowed
last
year
as
a
result
of
these
trends
global
carbon
dioxide
emissions
increased
by
percent
in
to
gigatons
a
record
high
the
significant
growth
in
global
carbon
dioxide
emissions
in
tells
us
that
current
efforts
to
combat
climate
change
are
far
from
sufficient
said
fatih
birol
the
iea
s
executive
director
for
example
there
has
been
a
dramatic
slowdown
in
the
rate
of
improvement
in
global
energy
efficiency
as
policy
makers
have
put
less
focus
in
this
carbon
dioxide
emissions
are
the
primary
cause
of
global
average
temperature
rise
which
countries
are
seeking
to
curb
to
avoid
the
most
devastating
effects
of
climate
change
at
talks
in
germany
late
last
year
among
almost
nations
about
details
of
a
global
climate
accord
scientists
presented
data
showing
that
world
carbon
emissions
were
set
to
rise
percent
in
to
a
new
record
global
emissions
need
to
peak
soon
and
decline
steeply
to
this
decline
will
now
need
to
be
even
greater
given
the
increase
in
emissions
in
the
iea
said
in
its
report
the
iea
said
asian
countries
accounted
for
two
thirds
of
the
global
increase
in
emissions
china
s
emissions
rose
by
percent
to
gigatons
limited
by
renewables
deployment
and
more
rapid
switching
to
gas
from
coal
most
major
economies
saw
an
increase
in
carbon
emissions
though
britain
the
united
states
mexico
and
japan
experienced
declines
the
biggest
drop
came
from
the
united
states
where
they
were
down
percent
to
gigatons
due
to
higher
renewables
deployment
the
iea
said
oil
demand
grew
by
percent
or
million
barrels
a
day
more
than
twice
the
average
annual
rate
over
the
past
decade
driven
by
the
transport
sector
and
rising
petrochemical
demand
natural
gas
consumption
grew
by
percent
the
most
of
all
fossil
fuels
with
china
alone
accounting
for
nearly
a
third
of
the
growth
this
was
largely
due
to
abundant
and
relatively
supplies
the
iea
said
coal
demand
was
percent
higher
last
year
reversing
declines
over
the
previous
two
years
due
to
rises
in
electricity
generation
mostly
in
asia
however
electricity
generation
rose
by
percent
due
to
the
expansion
of
wind
solar
and
hydropower
renewables
had
the
highest
growth
rate
of
any
energy
source
meeting
a
quarter
of
world
energy
demand
growth
