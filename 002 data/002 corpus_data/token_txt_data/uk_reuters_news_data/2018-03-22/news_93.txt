the
number
of
power
plants
built
worldwide
fell
steeply
over
the
past
two
years
but
emissions
are
too
high
to
keep
global
warming
within
relatively
safe
levels
campaigners
said
on
thursday
the
start
of
new
builds
dropped
by
percent
between
and
as
china
tightened
restrictions
on
coal
and
a
loss
of
private
finance
froze
construction
sites
in
india
according
to
a
report
by
greenpeace
the
sierra
club
and
coalswarm
newly
completed
coal
plants
also
fell
percent
and
the
number
of
plants
in
planning
dropped
by
percent
it
said
from
a
climate
and
health
perspective
the
trend
toward
a
declining
coal
power
fleet
is
encouraging
but
not
happening
fast
enough
said
ted
nace
the
san
director
of
coalswarm
a
network
of
researchers
on
fossil
fuels
to
meet
the
paris
climate
agreement
target
of
keeping
global
temperature
rise
this
century
well
below
degrees
celsius
above
levels
construction
must
end
and
existing
plants
must
retire
faster
the
report
said
but
global
coal
capacity
is
still
growing
rising
by
percent
in
the
last
months
according
to
the
world
coal
association
an
industry
network
ageing
coal
plants
in
europe
and
the
united
states
are
being
replaced
by
highly
efficient
plants
in
china
and
asia
it
said
in
the
last
five
years
as
china
became
the
largest
solar
and
wind
market
in
the
world
it
also
added
gigawatts
of
coal
power
thus
increasing
coal
generation
by
a
third
said
benjamin
sporton
head
of
the
world
coal
association
with
continued
global
reliance
on
coal
carbon
capture
and
storage
ccs
technologies
must
be
developed
to
reduce
fossil
fuel
emissions
he
said
we
need
to
be
resolute
in
our
efforts
to
accelerate
the
deployment
of
ccs
technologies
which
will
be
critical
to
achieving
global
climate
objectives
he
said
ccs
which
involves
capturing
carbon
dioxide
produced
by
burning
fossil
fuels
and
burying
it
underground
so
that
it
does
not
enter
the
atmosphere
is
costly
controversial
and
still
in
the
early
phases
of
testing
the
campaign
groups
said
global
coal
capacity
is
likely
to
start
shrinking
in
when
the
number
of
plants
retired
is
expected
to
outstrip
those
being
built
about
gigawatts
of
coal
power
equivalent
to
double
germany
s
coal
capacity
needs
to
be
retired
every
year
between
and
nace
said
it
a
tall
order
but
it
not
out
of
the
question
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
adding
that
mass
production
is
cutting
solar
and
wind
power
costs
faster
than
expected
and
markets
and
power
planners
are
taking
