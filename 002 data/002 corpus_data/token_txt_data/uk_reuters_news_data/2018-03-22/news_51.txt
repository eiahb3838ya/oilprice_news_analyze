reuters
jonathan
goldberg
the
founder
of
one
of
the
world
s
largest
hedge
funds
bbl
commodities
is
launching
a
new
billion
macro
fund
with
his
former
goldman
sachs
colleague
ben
jacobs
that
will
trade
currencies
and
equity
indices
based
on
commodities
trends
the
new
fund
was
launched
in
march
and
is
in
the
process
of
raising
million
from
founders
with
the
remaining
fundraising
expected
to
close
by
the
end
of
the
year
bbl
commodities
itself
currently
has
some
million
to
million
under
management
the
new
fund
will
be
a
rare
beast
in
the
market
where
commodities
are
often
being
traded
by
macro
funds
based
on
trends
but
goldberg
says
the
world
will
face
a
number
of
tectonic
changes
relating
to
commodities
in
the
next
few
years
that
will
be
so
big
that
they
will
allow
the
trading
of
entire
countries
based
on
them
one
of
the
trends
he
says
is
the
upcoming
change
in
global
marine
regulations
in
that
will
set
a
new
upper
limit
for
sulphur
content
in
fuel
used
for
shipping
to
cut
pollution
the
rule
will
see
a
drastic
reduction
in
demand
for
fuel
oil
currently
used
in
ships
and
raise
demand
for
cleaner
diesel
that
in
turn
will
depress
the
value
of
heavy
sulphurous
crude
oil
from
places
such
as
canada
as
they
tend
to
yield
more
fuel
oil
than
diesel
what
happens
to
the
balance
of
payments
of
canada
when
your
main
export
product
gets
less
value
and
who
which
country
and
currency
does
better
in
this
scenario
that
is
what
the
fund
will
be
looking
at
said
goldberg
the
wall
street
journal
was
first
to
report
about
the
launch
of
the
fund
the
impact
from
new
marine
fuel
regulations
might
be
as
big
as
if
not
bigger
than
those
from
the
shale
boom
on
the
global
oil
industry
said
goldberg
when
shale
oil
production
soared
in
the
world
had
an
oversupply
of
million
barrels
per
day
of
oil
equal
to
around
one
percent
of
demand
but
when
new
marine
fuel
regulation
comes
into
play
demand
for
diesel
will
probably
increase
by
about
million
barrels
per
day
or
by
over
six
percent
of
current
global
diesel
demand
said
goldberg
he
said
the
fund
will
be
also
look
at
currencies
such
as
the
australian
dollar
and
russian
rouble
interest
rates
and
equity
indices
across
commodity
producers
people
are
saying
the
world
will
have
a
petrochemical
boom
so
we
for
example
will
be
looking
at
what
this
boom
means
for
broad
indices
said
goldberg
he
said
the
advantage
of
having
a
macro
fund
exploring
commodity
trends
is
primarily
in
having
access
to
more
liquid
asset
classes
the
gasoline
market
is
simply
less
liquid
than
the
canadian
goldberg
is
fairly
bullish
on
oil
prices
in
the
short
term
but
in
the
medium
term
he
expects
crude
to
come
under
pressure
as
global
demand
growth
is
set
to
slow
opec
cuts
will
end
while
and
canadian
output
will
increase
on
the
back
of
improved
efficiency
