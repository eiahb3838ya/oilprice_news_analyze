norway adopts eu energy rules, averting break with bloc
oslo
reuters
norway
s
parliament
approved
the
adoption
of
european
union
energy
rules
on
thursday
over
the
objections
of
some
parties
allowing
the
eu
outsider
to
remain
a
full
member
of
eu
markets
the
leader
of
the
parliament
said
on
thursday
the
minority
government
feared
that
rejecting
the
eu
s
third
energy
package
designed
to
enhance
energy
flows
and
improve
regulatory
oversight
would
put
norway
on
a
slippery
slope
to
a
ending
of
its
close
eu
relations
for
the
past
years
norwegian
companies
have
enjoyed
market
access
on
equal
terms
with
companies
in
the
eu
via
the
european
economic
area
treaty
in
return
for
the
country
s
adoption
of
eu
common
market
regulations
opposition
to
the
energy
bill
came
from
politicians
and
trade
unions
fearing
norway
could
lose
control
of
its
abundant
hydroelectric
resources
to
secure
backing
for
the
regulation
the
government
struck
a
compromise
in
advance
with
the
main
opposition
labour
party
promising
that
all
power
cables
connecting
norway
to
other
countries
should
be
the
deal
with
labour
could
lead
to
the
cancellation
of
northconnect
a
planned
private
power
cable
between
norway
and
scotland
which
its
backers
had
hoped
to
put
into
operation
by
if
northconnect
does
eventually
go
ahead
it
would
have
to
be
under
public
ownership
labour
said
under
the
eea
treaty
norway
retains
the
right
to
refuse
the
adoption
of
eu
rules
but
has
never
done
so
as
this
would
allow
the
eu
to
retaliate
by
suspending
other
parts
of
the
agreement
