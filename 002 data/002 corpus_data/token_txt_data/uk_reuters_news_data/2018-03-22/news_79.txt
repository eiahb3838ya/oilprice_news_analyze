china's oil futures: frazzle or dazzle for foreign traders?
beijing
reuters
china
s
crude
oil
futures
to
be
launched
on
monday
will
be
a
major
step
in
beijing
s
push
to
win
greater
sway
over
oil
pricing
but
for
western
traders
it
will
likely
bring
frustration
as
well
as
opportunity
shanghai
crude
aims
to
rival
the
world
s
two
crude
benchmarks
luring
overseas
traders
with
the
promise
of
a
deep
pool
of
liquidity
and
the
chance
for
arbitrage
between
asian
and
european
markets
however
the
contract
will
also
come
with
quirks
that
traders
used
to
london
s
brent
or
west
texas
intermediate
wti
may
find
less
appealing
including
shorter
business
hours
unique
chinese
trading
habits
and
extended
holiday
breaks
trading
and
a
blend
of
new
rules
and
regulatory
burdens
will
also
likely
hamper
initial
on
the
shanghai
international
energy
exchange
ine
executives
at
a
dozen
banks
and
brokers
and
experts
involved
in
the
launch
told
reuters
the
rules
around
trading
methodology
will
be
unfamiliar
for
western
houses
said
john
browning
chief
operating
officer
of
hong
futures
broker
bands
financial
ltd
which
is
an
approved
overseas
intermediary
for
the
ine
they
ll
have
to
get
to
grips
with
a
different
set
of
trading
parameters
including
initial
margin
calculation
rolling
between
months
order
cancellations
ratios
etc
it
s
all
very
so
far
china
has
opened
more
than
trading
accounts
including
the
country
s
oil
majors
and
about
brokerages
ten
foreign
intermediaries
have
registered
including
bands
financial
straits
financial
services
and
other
hong
kong
based
affiliates
of
domestic
brokerages
changes
are
still
being
made
to
entice
overseas
users
on
tuesday
the
government
said
it
would
waive
income
taxes
for
foreign
investors
for
the
first
three
years
specific
issues
for
traders
include
shanghai
s
shorter
trading
hours
split
into
three
slots
with
the
afternoon
session
ending
at
local
time
gmt
just
before
london
ramps
up
although
the
exchange
will
have
an
overnight
trading
session
to
match
late
european
and
early
trading
it
will
close
for
more
than
six
hours
before
trade
resumes
in
beijing
this
could
mean
the
contract
risks
having
to
play
each
morning
to
the
moods
and
swings
of
europe
and
america
rather
than
setting
its
own
price
several
senior
futures
traders
said
chinese
trading
habits
may
also
be
a
shock
to
foreign
users
they
said
chinese
commodity
futures
investors
do
not
typically
trade
steadily
over
the
months
but
instead
pick
specific
months
in
which
they
deal
due
to
a
different
cost
structure
that
could
complicate
efforts
to
trade
spreads
between
brent
wti
and
shanghai
these
and
other
factors
mean
the
contract
may
have
a
hard
time
building
correlations
with
brent
and
wti
that
would
make
arbitrage
possible
said
albert
helmig
chief
executive
of
financial
consultancy
grey
house
and
a
former
vice
chairman
of
nymex
it
s
a
china
market
with
chinese
characteristics
said
helmig
still
china
offers
the
potential
for
a
deep
liquid
market
buoyed
by
an
explosion
of
interest
from
investors
that
has
supported
its
vast
commodities
derivative
markets
from
apples
to
iron
ore
in
shanghai
zhengzhou
and
dalian
in
the
total
traded
value
of
shfe
s
steel
derivatives
contracts
was
trillion
from
domestic
investors
this
compares
with
global
turnover
of
more
than
trillion
in
international
oil
futures
the
world
s
biggest
commodity
market
previous
attempts
at
an
asia
benchmark
have
foundered
contracts
set
up
by
the
dubai
mercantile
exchange
a
decade
ago
have
not
matched
brent
or
wti
traded
on
the
intercontinental
exchange
and
the
new
york
mercantile
exchange
nymex
owned
by
cme
group
china
hopes
it
can
do
better
with
oil
majors
like
petrochina
and
sinopec
expected
to
provide
liquidity
analysts
said
the
contract
has
a
chance
of
succeeding
even
if
it
faces
caution
launching
a
new
exchange
is
enormously
complex
so
if
the
initial
uptake
for
the
contract
isn
t
that
strong
it
isn
t
necessarily
a
bad
thing
