update 1-macron pushes for eu minimum price for carbon
brussels
reuters
europe
must
set
a
minimum
price
for
carbon
french
president
emmanuel
macron
said
on
thursday
something
that
would
require
a
new
tax
on
imports
from
countries
that
are
not
doing
enough
to
tackle
climate
change
since
his
election
in
may
macron
has
championed
policies
to
combat
climate
change
putting
him
at
odds
with
president
donald
trump
who
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
the
paris
climate
accord
macron
reiterated
that
france
would
increase
the
price
of
carbon
emitted
there
to
euros
per
tonne
in
from
euros
this
year
but
he
said
the
carbon
trading
market
was
not
working
efficiently
at
the
european
level
we
need
a
european
price
floor
for
carbon
i
know
it
won
t
be
easy
there
will
be
resistance
from
all
around
macron
told
a
conference
on
financing
sustainable
growth
in
brussels
ahead
of
a
summit
of
european
union
leaders
such
a
minimum
price
would
incentivise
greener
investments
but
would
need
to
be
accompanied
by
a
tax
on
goods
from
countries
beyond
europe
s
borders
who
do
not
make
the
same
environmental
choices
he
said
macron
also
said
there
should
be
a
target
for
eu
budget
spending
to
help
a
transition
to
a
green
economy
and
no
eu
spending
should
be
hostile
to
the
environment
i
think
a
target
of
percent
of
the
budget
would
allow
for
this
transition
to
be
ambitious
rather
than
measured
as
it
