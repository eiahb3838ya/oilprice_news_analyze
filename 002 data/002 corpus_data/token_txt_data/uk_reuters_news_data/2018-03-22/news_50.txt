frankfurt

bmw
will
not
mass
produce
electric
cars
until
because
its
current
technology
is
not
profitable
enough
to
scale
up
for
volume
production
the
chief
executive
said
on
thursday
bmw
unveiled
its
first
battery
electric
car
in
and
has
been
working
on
different
generations
of
battery
software
and
electric
motor
technology
since
then
the
roadster
model
due
to
hit
showrooms
in
may
is
equipped
with
what
bmw
calls
its
electric
drive
technology
advances
in
battery
raw
materials
and
chemistry
has
increased
its
range
by
percent
over
the
previous
version
bmw
said
bmw
is
working
to
make
electric
car
technology
more
modular
and
scaleable
to
make
mass
production
commercially
viable
we
wanted
to
wait
for
the
fifth
generation
to
be
much
more
cost
competitive
chief
executive
harald
krueger
told
analysts
in
munich
we
do
not
want
to
scale
up
with
the
fourth
the
cost
advantage
between
bmw
s
fourth
and
fifth
generation
electric
vehicle
technology
was
a
two
digit
number
in
percent
terms
krueger
said
he
did
not
offer
precise
figures
if
you
want
to
win
the
race
you
must
be
the
most
cost
competitive
in
the
segment
otherwise
you
can
not
scale
up
the
volume
he
said
bmw
is
working
on
a
sixth
generation
of
its
technology
and
is
investing
a
euro
amount
in
battery
cell
research
to
better
understand
mass
production
the
company
said
bmw
makes
electric
cars
at
plants
across
the
world
but
has
focussed
mainly
on
hybrids
which
combine
combustion
engines
with
battery
powered
electric
motors
rather
than
vehicles
reliant
solely
on
batteries
for
their
power
bmw
said
it
wanted
to
add
new
electrified
models
by
of
which
vehicles
will
be
fully
battery
electric
variants
thanks
to
a
new
production
method
available
from
onwards
bmw
will
be
able
to
make
all
its
cars
with
pure
electric
hybrid
and
combustion
engined
variants
in
bmw
will
start
making
a
fully
electric
mini
at
its
plant
on
the
outskirts
of
the
british
city
of
oxford
and
will
start
production
of
a
