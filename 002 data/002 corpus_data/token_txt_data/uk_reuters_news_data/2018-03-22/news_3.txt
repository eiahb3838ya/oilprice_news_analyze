washington
reuters
opec
members
will
need
to
continue
coordinating
with
russia
and
other
countries
on
supply
curbs
in
to
reduce
global
oil
inventories
to
desired
levels
saudi
arabian
energy
minister
khalid
said
on
thursday
opec
and
countries
struck
a
production
supply
agreement
in
january
to
remove
million
barrels
per
day
from
global
markets
and
end
a
supply
glut
the
cuts
helped
lift
oil
prices
to
current
levels
of
around
per
barrel
the
oil
producers
will
convene
in
june
in
vienna
to
discuss
further
cooperation
crude
oil
futures
settled
on
thursday
at
a
barrel
and
brent
crude
settled
at
we
know
for
sure
that
we
still
have
some
time
to
go
before
we
bring
inventories
down
to
the
level
we
consider
normal
and
we
will
identify
that
by
when
we
meet
in
vienna
falih
told
reuters
in
an
interview
in
washington
and
then
we
will
hopefully
by
identify
the
mechanism
by
which
we
will
work
in
it
was
unclear
what
oil
supplies
would
need
to
be
in
he
said
falih
has
previously
said
that
opec
would
do
better
to
leave
the
oil
market
slightly
short
of
supplies
rather
than
ending
too
early
the
output
cut
deal
falih
said
on
thursday
there
is
a
general
acceptance
among
producers
that
further
coordination
does
not
necessarily
mean
maintaining
the
same
level
of
cuts
it
just
means
that
the
mechanism
has
worked
and
they
have
committed
to
work
within
that
mechanism
for
a
much
longer
period
he
said
a
new
framework
requires
agility
and
a
willingness
to
do
things
differently
in
terms
of
what
levels
of
production
as
the
market
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
spearheaded
efforts
to
reduce
global
oil
stockpiles
to
their
average
ending
years
of
oversupply
sparked
by
the
rapid
rise
in
production
from
shale
oil
producers
in
the
united
states
despite
continued
rapid
growth
in
output
from
the
united
states
falih
said
he
did
not
consider
the
shale
industry
to
be
a
threat
without
shale
supplies
he
said
global
supplies
would
have
been
tight
saudi
arabia
needs
high
and
stable
oil
prices
if
it
is
to
succeed
in
turning
the
planned
share
listing
of
state
oil
company
saudi
aramco
into
the
world
s
biggest
share
sale
saudi
arabia
is
planning
to
list
up
to
percent
of
saudi
aramco
in
the
offering
a
successful
ipo
could
give
the
company
a
total
valuation
of
up
to
trillion
trillion
making
it
the
world
s
biggest
oil
company
by
market
capitalization
falih
said
the
kingdom
may
still
move
forward
with
the
planned
initial
public
offering
ipo
in
the
second
half
of
despite
previously
raising
doubts
it
could
be
delayed
to
next
year
the
timing
of
a
float
would
depend
on
market
conditions
and
the
kingdom
is
ready
to
execute
the
ipo
at
any
time
we
have
prepared
all
documentation
to
be
ready
to
do
both
domestic
and
international
listings
falih
said
we
have
not
closed
the
door
on
he
said
the
kingdom
needed
to
be
sure
that
the
market
is
ready
and
is
this
an
optimum
time
to
falih
said
the
company
could
be
floated
either
domestically
or
internationally
late
this
year
new
york
is
still
in
the
running
for
the
ipo
but
saudi
officials
still
need
to
weigh
the
potential
legal
risks
of
a
listing
in
the
united
states
he
said
we
have
concerns
obviously
aramco
is
too
big
and
too
valuable
and
too
important
he
said
we
could
be
potentially
at
risk
from
some
frivolous
lawsuits
and
litigation
that
we
have
to
consider
in
our
final
legal
challenges
could
arise
from
a
law
that
would
allow
victims
of
militant
attacks
to
sue
foreign
governments
for
compensation
