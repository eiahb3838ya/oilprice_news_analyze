update 2-self-driving car industry confronts trust issues after uber crash
reuters
the
fatal
accident
involving
an
uber
car
cranks
up
pressure
on
the
vehicle
industry
to
prove
its
software
and
sensors
are
safe
in
the
absence
of
strong
government
standards
experts
in
the
field
said
automakers
including
general
motors
co
technology
companies
such
as
alphabet
inc
and
ride
services
providers
like
uber
technologies
inc
have
all
urged
policy
makers
at
the
federal
and
state
level
not
to
put
a
heavy
regulatory
hand
on
an
industry
still
in
development
they
have
said
their
extensive
testing
demonstrates
commitment
to
safety
uber
is
currently
looking
for
a
head
of
global
safety
operations
who
would
drive
key
strategic
programs
including
safety
experience
and
building
trust
according
to
a
job
posting
on
the
company
s
website
the
search
was
posted
before
the
arizona
fatality
the
uber
accident
in
tempe
arizona
this
week
was
the
first
death
attributed
to
a
car
operating
in
autonomous
mode
it
has
given
ammunition
to
critics
of
the
industry
concerned
that
the
lack
of
clear
standards
allows
manufacturers
to
test
faulty
or
partially
developed
technology
on
public
streets
well
before
sunday
s
fatal
accident
industry
executives
had
begun
to
confront
questions
about
whether
cars
can
be
trusted
they
have
opened
up
about
their
testing
methods
without
revealing
secrets
of
system
designs
public
disclosure
of
car
testing
data
is
inconsistent
and
varies
by
state
california
requires
manufacturers
to
report
instances
when
an
autonomous
vehicle
system
disengages
arizona
does
not
there
is
no
question
whatsoever
that
regulations
are
coming
said
doug
mehl
a
partner
at
kearney
s
automotive
practice
based
in
detroit
but
right
now
automakers
software
developers
and
service
providers
have
an
opportunity
to
shape
what
those
regulations
are
going
to
look
alphabet
s
waymo
car
unit
has
underscored
in
a
report
that
its
autonomous
vehicles
have
now
logged
million
miles
in
testing
and
billions
more
in
computer
simulations
gm
s
cruise
automation
unit
has
highlighted
its
decision
to
teach
its
driving
system
to
navigate
san
francisco
s
congested
streets
still
amnon
shashua
head
of
intel
corp
s
mobileye
vision
systems
unit
said
the
industry
must
do
more
he
has
called
for
the
vehicle
industry
to
develop
provable
safety
assurances
we
need
to
prove
that
these
vehicles
are
much
much
safer
than
humans
shashua
told
reuters
how
do
you
go
and
guarantee
that
you
have
a
technology
that
the
probability
of
a
fatality
per
one
hour
of
driving
is
times
better
than
a
human
nobody
talks
about
that
because
nobody
knows
what
to
most
vehicles
are
equipped
with
radar
sensors
and
lidar
sensors
which
use
lasers
to
detect
obstacles
around
the
vehicle
there
are
no
federal
standards
yet
specifying
how
such
systems
should
work
congress
and
federal
regulators
are
still
debating
how
tightly
to
regulate
such
systems
there
should
be
vision
tests
for
the
sensors
they
are
using
both
static
and
dynamic
to
see
how
well
they
work
said
missy
cummings
a
duke
university
mechanical
engineering
professor
the
short
video
recorded
by
cameras
in
the
uber
vehicle
that
struck
pedestrian
elaine
herzberg
while
crossing
a
street
in
tempe
arizona
late
sunday
raises
questions
about
whether
the
uber
system
responded
better
than
a
human
driver
experts
said
on
wednesday
uber
has
hired
human
operators
to
sit
in
driver
s
seats
of
its
autonomous
vehicles
to
intervene
if
necessary
the
video
released
by
tempe
police
shows
a
human
operator
behind
the
wheel
of
the
uber
vehicle
before
the
impact
the
operator
is
seen
looking
down
away
from
the
street
in
the
seconds
before
the
vehicle
struck
herzberg
she
was
pushing
a
bicycle
across
the
street
from
left
lane
into
the
right
lane
where
the
uber
vehicle
was
driving
it
seems
it
should
have
detected
her
daniel
sperling
director
of
the
institute
for
transportation
studies
at
university
of
california
davis
told
reuters
in
an
email
after
viewing
the
video
it
seems
unlikely
that
a
human
driver
would
have
done
better
we
do
want
avs
to
do
better
than
us
and
the
potential
americans
were
wary
of
autonomous
vehicle
technology
even
before
sunday
s
fatality
according
to
a
opinion
poll
released
in
late
january
of
americans
are
uncomfortable
about
the
idea
of
riding
in
cars
the
greater
risk
for
the
industry
is
that
if
people
feel
it
is
unsafe
or
the
testing
is
unsafe
you
ll
see
a
real
backlash
against
this
technology
