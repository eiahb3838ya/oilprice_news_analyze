veronica
cabe
still
remembers
every
minute
of
the
more
than
hours
she
and
her
family
spent
huddled
on
the
roof
of
their
home
in
manila
in
as
floodwaters
swept
past
carrying
dead
bodies
animal
carcasses
and
coffins
typhoon
ketsana
which
killed
about
people
was
the
most
devastating
typhoon
to
hit
the
philippine
capital
in
decades
as
the
frequency
and
intensity
of
storms
increased
cabe
began
to
speak
up
about
holding
someone
responsible
in
she
became
a
petitioner
in
a
landmark
complaint
soon
to
be
examined
by
a
national
inquiry
which
accuses
global
oil
mining
and
cement
companies
of
human
rights
violations
by
playing
a
role
in
driving
climate
change
next
week
cabe
will
be
among
more
than
a
dozen
experts
and
citizens
to
testify
that
the
greenhouse
gas
emissions
of
some
firms
infringe
on
filipinos
rights
to
life
food
water
sanitation
and
adequate
housing
through
the
growing
impacts
of
global
warming
we
thought
we
would
die
on
that
roof
it
was
so
scary
so
traumatic
said
cabe
a
community
organiser
but
it
also
made
me
really
angry
can
we
only
pray
should
we
just
accept
our
fate
whenever
disaster
strikes
or
can
we
hold
someone
accountable
if
the
carbon
majors
are
causing
damage
then
they
can
not
just
carry
on
she
said
the
philippines
is
ranked
as
one
of
the
countries
most
severely
hit
by
wild
weather
by
climate
change
now
disaster
survivors
and
about
a
dozen
rights
groups
led
by
greenpeace
southeast
asia
are
aiming
to
force
companies
to
declare
their
plans
to
prevent
and
mitigate
the
impact
of
emissions
from
extracting
burning
and
selling
fossil
fuels
which
scientists
say
are
warming
the
planet
the
philippine
commission
on
human
rights
chr
an
independent
body
set
up
by
the
government
agreed
in
to
conduct
an
inquiry
and
will
hold
its
first
public
hearings
next
week
in
manila
followed
by
additional
hearings
in
london
and
new
york
oil
giants
chevron
and
bp
and
miner
rio
tinto
are
among
the
carbon
majors
cited
in
the
petition
the
three
companies
did
not
respond
to
emails
seeking
comment
but
at
least
half
a
dozen
companies
submitted
responses
in
to
the
commission
and
organisations
backing
the
complaint
outlining
the
steps
they
are
taking
to
curb
corporate
emissions
some
firms
also
argued
they
were
not
subject
to
the
commission
s
jurisdiction
nor
required
to
submit
to
its
proceedings
the
inquiry
is
the
first
time
a
government
agency
has
accepted
and
acted
on
a
request
for
investigation
of
the
environmental
responsibility
of
companies
that
sell
or
are
heavy
users
of
fossil
fuels
according
to
zelda
soriano
an
attorney
with
greenpeace
southeast
asia
it
s
the
first
case
to
use
the
framework
to
take
on
carbon
majors
causing
climate
change
it
is
a
big
deal
for
a
small
human
rights
body
in
a
small
country
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
commission
can
only
make
recommendations
to
philippine
legislators
and
the
business
world
and
has
no
enforcement
powers
but
soriano
said
the
inquiry
would
set
a
precedent
and
the
commission
s
resolution
and
proposed
measures
would
add
weight
to
every
existing
and
future
litigation
case
in
any
part
of
the
world
no
matter
the
outcome
the
philippines
complaint
complements
a
global
upsurge
in
legal
challenges
seeking
redress
for
impacts
legal
filings
in
countries
from
germany
to
pakistan
and
the
netherlands
aim
to
force
faster
action
to
tackle
climate
change
and
its
impacts
or
claim
damages
from
energy
firms
earlier
this
month
a
federal
appeals
court
rejected
the
government
s
bid
to
halt
a
lawsuit
by
young
people
claiming
that
the
administration
is
violating
their
constitutional
rights
by
ignoring
the
harms
caused
by
climate
change
in
norway
activists
have
said
the
country
s
plans
for
arctic
oil
exploration
are
unconstitutional
in
an
emerging
branch
of
law
where
plaintiffs
are
trying
to
enlist
a
nation
s
founding
principles
to
limit
warming
according
to
a
study
commissioned
by
the
climate
justice
programme
and
greenpeace
international
companies
including
chevron
exxonmobil
and
bp
have
contributed
a
large
share
of
the
carbon
dioxide
and
methane
emissions
causing
climate
change
the
philippine
human
rights
commission
will
allow
companies
named
in
the
complaint
to
present
their
arguments
and
aims
to
conclude
its
inquiry
this
year
soriano
said
it
plans
to
pass
a
resolution
next
year
the
commission
in
a
statement
said
the
case
was
novel
in
its
attempt
to
haul
the
carbon
majors
in
a
petition
involving
human
rights
and
promote
the
notion
that
businesses
have
an
obligation
to
respect
human
rights
the
inquiry
it
is
hoped
would
result
in
the
improvement
development
of
measures
to
further
protect
and
promote
human
rights
in
this
era
of
climate
change
it
added
this
and
other
cases
attest
that
governments
are
not
moving
fast
enough
or
ambitiously
enough
on
climate
said
sarah
labowitz
of
the
new
york
university
stern
center
for
business
and
human
rights
even
if
the
philippines
petition
isn
t
successful
on
the
merits
we
can
look
at
it
as
a
demand
made
by
people
without
a
lot
of
power
for
action
by
the
biggest
and
most
powerful
actors
she
said
the
hearings
in
the
philippines
come
amid
rising
instances
of
violence
against
activists
trying
to
protect
the
country
s
environment
the
philippines
recorded
the
highest
number
of
such
attacks
in
asia
last
year
cabe
s
former
colleague
gloria
capitan
was
shot
dead
in
for
opposing
a
project
in
bataan
province
but
cabe
said
the
fight
must
go
on
urging
companies
to
do
business
in
a
way
that
does
not
harm
communities
or
nature
we
need
electricity
but
not
at
the
cost
of
our
lives
and
at
the
cost
of
the
environment
