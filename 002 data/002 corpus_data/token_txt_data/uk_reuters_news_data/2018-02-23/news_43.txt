norway's wealth fund eyes low-carbon society in energy investments
oslo
reuters
norway
s
trillion
sovereign
wealth
fund
the
world
s
largest
will
generally
shun
investments
in
energy
sources
such
as
coal
that
are
unlikely
to
be
needed
in
a
future
society
it
said
on
friday
in
the
norwegian
parliament
mandated
the
fund
which
invests
norway
s
revenues
from
oil
and
gas
production
in
stocks
bonds
and
real
estate
abroad
to
sell
out
of
firms
that
derive
more
than
percent
of
their
activities
or
revenues
from
coal
this
divestment
from
coal
means
that
the
fund
does
not
generally
invest
in
an
energy
source
that
will
probably
not
survive
the
transition
to
a
society
the
fund
said
in
a
letter
to
the
norwegian
ministry
of
finance
dated
the
letter
signed
by
fund
ceo
yngve
slyngstad
and
chief
corporate
governance
officer
carine
smith
ihenacho
was
published
on
the
fund
s
website
on
friday
the
fund
s
exposure
to
climate
risk
therefore
differs
from
that
of
a
general
portfolio
it
added
the
fund
proposed
in
november
that
it
should
remove
oil
and
gas
stocks
from
its
equity
benchmark
index
which
would
mean
cutting
investments
in
those
companies
over
time
at
the
time
the
news
sent
the
value
of
oil
and
gas
firm
worldwide
lower
the
proposal
is
under
review
at
the
finance
ministry
and
will
be
voted
on
by
the
norwegian
parliament
at
a
later
stage
