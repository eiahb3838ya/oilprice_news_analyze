london

prices
in
europe
s
biggest
gas
markets
surged
percent
this
week
ahead
of
a
cold
snap
that
will
test
the
region
s
reduced
supply
options
and
make
price
spikes
more
likely
as
stocks
run
low
a
late
winter
blast
of
cold
in
europe
has
left
traders
scrambling
for
gas
in
british
dutch
belgian
and
french
markets
after
several
setbacks
to
quick
sources
of
supply
in
the
region
these
include
new
limits
on
output
at
europe
s
biggest
gas
field
in
groningen
the
netherlands
and
utility
centrica
s
decision
to
close
britain
s
biggest
gas
storage
site
gas
stockpiles
held
in
underground
sites
in
britain
belgium
and
france
are
at
their
lowest
since
at
least
and
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
shipments
are
scant
following
increased
demand
from
asia
in
britain
gas
prices
rose
near
percent
this
week
as
plummeting
temperatures
boosted
demand
for
gas
which
is
used
to
heat
up
to
percent
of
the
country
s
homes
traders
said
demand
next
week
could
reach
the
highest
since
when
britain
saw
near
record
demand
as
temperatures
in
some
parts
of
the
country
fell
below
minus
degrees
celsius
france
belgium
and
the
netherlands
face
similar
challenges
a
cold
easterly
flow
will
bring
increasingly
colder
air
from
europe
meteorologist
georg
muller
said
britain
s
gas
market
in
particular
is
bracing
the
uk
is
much
more
at
risk
to
spiking
prices
given
the
limited
levels
of
seasonal
storage
that
has
been
caused
by
the
closure
of
rough
said
energy
aspects
analyst
trevor
sikorski
centrica
decided
last
year
to
close
the
more
than
year
old
rough
site
which
at
its
operational
peak
could
hold
around
percent
of
the
country
s
gas
demand
with
storage
quite
low
and
domestic
supplies
including
the
lack
of
rough
lower
dutch
gas
output
from
groningen
and
low
liquefied
natural
gas
imports
there
is
a
lack
of
flexibility
across
the
whole
of
western
europe
a
gas
trader
said
british
gas
imports
from
the
netherlands
have
plummeted
as
production
at
the
groningen
field
has
been
cut
to
try
to
reduce
earthquakes
in
the
region
dutch
imports
fell
more
than
percent
last
year
data
from
britain
s
department
for
business
energy
and
industrial
strategy
published
this
week
showed
only
a
sharp
increase
in
lng
imports
could
provide
some
bearish
pressure
on
prices
as
groningen
production
is
likely
to
be
further
reduced
in
coming
months

second
