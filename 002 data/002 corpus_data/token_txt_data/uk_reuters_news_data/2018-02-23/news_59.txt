japanese scientists invent floating 'firefly' light
tokyo
reuters
japanese
engineering
researchers
say
they
have
created
a
tiny
electronic
light
the
size
of
a
firefly
which
rides
waves
of
ultrasound
and
could
eventually
figure
in
applications
ranging
from
moving
displays
to
projection
mapping
named
luciola
for
its
resemblance
to
the
firefly
the
featherweight
levitating
particle
weighs
mg
has
a
diameter
of
mm
inch
and
emits
a
red
glimmer
that
can
just
about
illuminate
text
but
its
minuscule
size
belies
the
power
of
the
microspeakers
emitting
ultrasonic
waves
that
hold
up
the
light
and
have
a
frequency
inaudible
to
the
human
ear
allowing
luciola
to
operate
in
apparent
total
silence
it
took
two
years
for
luciola
to
get
this
far
said
circuit
design
specialist
makoto
takamiya
a
member
of
the
kawahara
universal
information
network
project
that
developed
the
device
ultimately
my
hope
is
that
such
tiny
objects
will
have
smartphone
capabilities
and
be
built
to
float
about
helping
us
in
our
everyday
lives
in
smarter
ways
said
the
university
of
tokyo
professor
who
hopes
it
will
be
commercially
viable
in
five
to
years
the
developers
expect
luciola
to
find
applications
in
the
internet
of
things
in
which
regular
objects
such
as
cars
or
domestic
appliances
such
as
are
connected
to
networks
to
send
and
receive
data
equipped
with
movement
or
temperature
sensors
luciola
could
fly
to
such
objects
to
deliver
a
message
or
help
to
make
moving
displays
with
multiple
lights
that
can
detect
the
presence
of
humans
or
participate
in
futuristic
projection
mapping
events
the
kawahara
universal
information
network
project
is
a
program
that
is
part
of
the
japan
science
and
technology
agency
and
explores
advances
in
information
and
communication
