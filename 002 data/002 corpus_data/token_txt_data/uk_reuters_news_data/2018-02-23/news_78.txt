new
york
reuters
president
donald
trump
has
called
a
meeting
early
next
week
with
key
senators
and
cabinet
officials
to
discuss
potential
changes
to
biofuels
policy
which
is
coming
under
increasing
pressure
after
a
pennsylvania
refiner
blamed
the
regulation
for
its
bankruptcy
according
to
four
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
the
meeting
comes
as
the
oil
industry
and
corn
lobby
powerful
forces
in
washington
clash
over
the
future
of
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
a
regulation
that
requires
refiners
to
cover
the
cost
of
mixing
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
into
their
fuel
trump
s
engagement
reflects
the
high
political
stakes
of
protecting
jobs
in
a
key
electoral
state
oil
refiner
philadelphia
energy
solutions
pes
which
employs
more
than
a
thousand
people
in
philadelphia
declared
bankruptcy
last
month
and
blamed
the
regulation
for
its
demise
the
meeting
scheduled
for
tuesday
will
include
republican
senators
ted
cruz
of
texas
chuck
grassley
and
joni
ernst
of
iowa
along
with
environmental
protection
agency
administrator
scott
pruitt
agriculture
secretary
sonny
perdue
and
potentially
energy
secretary
rick
perry
according
to
the
four
sources
who
asked
not
to
be
named
because
they
were
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
on
the
matter
one
source
said
the
meeting
would
focus
on
solutions
to
help
pes
continue
operating
pes
is
asking
a
bankruptcy
judge
to
shed
roughly
million
of
its
current
rfs
compliance
costs
owed
to
the
epa
which
administers
the
program
as
part
of
its
restructuring
package
the
other
sources
said
the
meeting
will
consider
whether
to
cap
prices
for
biofuel
credits
let
blends
be
sold
all
year
and
efforts
to
get
speculators
out
of
the
market
officials
at
the
epa
agriculture
department
and
energy
department
declined
to
comment
a
white
house
official
kelly
love
said
she
had
no
announcement
on
the
matter
at
this
time
the
offices
of
cruz
ernst
and
grassley
did
not
immediately
return
requests
for
comment
the
sources
said
the
options
moving
forward
would
be
constrained
by
political
and
legal
realities
that
have
derailed
previous
efforts
at
reform
the
trump
administration
has
already
considered
changes
to
the
rfs
sought
by
refiners
this
year
including
reducing
the
amount
of
biofuels
required
to
be
blended
annually
under
the
regulation
or
shifting
the
responsibility
for
blending
to
supply
terminals
only
to
retreat
in
the
face
of
opposition
from
lawmakers
the
epa
is
expected
to
weigh
in
officially
in
the
coming
weeks
on
pes
s
request
to
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
be
released
from
its
compliance
obligations
but
any
such
move
would
likely
draw
a
backlash
from
other
refiners
who
have
no
hope
of
receiving
a
waiver
under
the
rfs
refiners
must
earn
or
purchase
blending
credits
called
rins
to
prove
they
are
complying
with
the
regulation
as
biofuels
volumes
quotas
have
increased
so
have
prices
for
the
credits
meaning
refiners
that
invested
in
blending
facilities
have
benefited
while
those
that
have
not
such
as
pes
have
had
to
pay
up
pes
said
its
rfs
compliance
costs
exceeded
its
payroll
last
year
and
ranked
only
behind
the
cost
of
purchasing
crude
oil
other
issues
may
have
contributed
to
pes
s
financial
difficulties
reuters
reported
that
pes
s
investor
backers
withdrew
from
the
company
more
than
million
in
a
series
of
distributions
since
even
as
regional
refining
economics
slumped
regulators
and
lawmakers
have
been
considering
how
to
cut
the
cost
of
the
rfs
to
the
oil
industry
in
recent
months
for
example
the
epa
has
contemplated
expanding
its
use
of
an
exemption
available
to
small
refineries
a
move
that
would
likely
push
down
rin
prices
but
which
both
the
oil
and
corn
industries
have
said
would
be
unfair
cruz
last
year
proposed
limiting
the
price
of
rins
to
cents
a
fraction
of
their
current
value
an
idea
that
was
roundly
rejected
by
the
ethanol
industry
as
a
disincentive
for
new
ethanol
blending
infrastructure
investment
senator
john
cornyn
also
a
texas
republican
is
preparing
draft
legislation
to
overhaul
the
rfs
in
congress
that
would
include
the
creation
of
a
new
specialized
rin
credit
intended
to
push
down
prices
but
it
too
faces
resistance
from
both
the
corn
and
oil
lobbies
