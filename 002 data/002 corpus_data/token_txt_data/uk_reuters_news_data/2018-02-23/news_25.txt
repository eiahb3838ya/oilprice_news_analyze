reuters
the
world
will
need
sweeping
changes
over
the
next
years
ranging
from
energy
use
to
food
production
to
achieve
climate
goals
set
by
almost
nations
the
new
heads
of
a
top
environmental
said
on
friday
both
said
revolutions
were
needed
to
tackle
climate
change
such
as
capturing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
from
power
plants
that
burn
fossil
fuels
or
by
reforming
agriculture
where
meat
production
and
fertilisers
are
big
sources
of
greenhouse
gases
developed
nations
should
set
an
example
such
as
germany
where
chancellor
angela
merkel
is
under
pressure
to
end
the
use
of
coal
in
power
generation
when
germany
is
not
in
a
position
to
phase
out
coal
can
we
expect
that
poland
or
indonesia
or
vietnam
or
turkey
can
phase
out
coal
ottmar
edenhofer
new
of
the
potsdam
institute
for
climate
impact
research
told
reuters
edenhofer
formerly
the
institute
s
chief
economist
and
new
johan
rockstrom
a
swedish
scientist
said
governments
were
far
from
achieving
the
core
goal
in
the
paris
agreement
of
limiting
a
rise
in
global
average
temperatures
to
well
below
two
degrees
celsius
fahrenheit
above
times
we
have
just
literally
years
to
either
succeed
or
fail
in
the
goals
of
getting
the
planet
on
a
more
sustainable
path
rockstrom
said
in
a
joint
telephone
interview
the
university
of
pennsylvania
rated
the
potsdam
institute
as
the
world
s
top
environment
policy
this
month
the
institute
plans
to
exploit
more
data
to
try
to
grasp
harm
from
natural
disasters
linked
to
climate
change
such
as
floods
droughts
or
storms
poor
families
in
developing
nations
often
focus
for
instance
on
rebuilding
their
homes
after
a
natural
disaster
but
sometimes
stopped
sending
their
children
to
school
even
after
reconstruction
edenhofer
said
the
institute
could
use
more
satellite
data
for
instance
the
amount
of
light
emitted
at
night
by
villages
in
developing
nations
as
a
gauge
of
local
poverty
and
vulnerability
he
said
the
poorest
have
the
least
access
to
electricity
rockstrom
and
edenhofer
were
named
by
the
institute
on
friday
to
succeed
