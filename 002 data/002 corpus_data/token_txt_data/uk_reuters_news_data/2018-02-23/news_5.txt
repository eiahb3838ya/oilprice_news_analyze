the
german
government
which
has
steadfastly
opposed
bans
on
diesel
cars
in
cities
now
plans
legal
changes
that
would
allow
driving
bans
on
certain
routes
on
an
emergency
basis
the
rheinische
post
newspaper
reported
on
saturday
transportation
state
secretary
norbert
barthle
a
conservative
disclosed
the
change
of
approach
in
a
reply
to
a
parliamentary
query
by
the
greens
party
the
newspaper
said
news
of
the
shift
comes
days
before
a
german
court
rules
on
whether
cities
can
implement
driving
bans
that
could
lower
the
resale
value
of
up
to
million
vehicles
in
europe
s
largest
car
market
forcing
to
pay
for
modifications
germany
s
federal
government
is
under
pressure
to
help
cities
whose
emissions
violate
eu
standards
a
new
legal
basis
is
to
be
established
in
the
road
traffic
act
that
would
allow
driving
bans
or
restrictions
on
certain
limited
limited
routes
to
protect
human
health
against
particulates
or
emissions

oxide
barthle
said
in
the
reply
that
would
make
possible
for
the
first
time
emergency
measures
to
protect
against
particulates
he
said
adding
that
the
changes
would
make
it
possible
for
cities
to
implement
driving
bans
outside
of
air
pollution
plans
he
said
the
changes
could
be
incorporated
in
revisions
now
being
prepared
to
provide
parking
privileges
to
vehicles
operated
by
services
and
the
entire
package
of
measures
could
be
finalised
by
the
end
of
the
year
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
this
month
she
wanted
to
avoid
driving
bans
by
focusing
on
switching
fleets
of
taxis
and
buses
to
electric
propulsion
as
well
as
other
measures
but
she
also
underscored
the
need
to
find
solutions
quickly
for
the
affected
cities
greens
lawmaker
matthias
gastel
said
the
federal
government
now
appeared
to
view
limited
driving
bans
as
unavoidable
but
was
still
leaving
the
issue
up
to
cities
and
communities
it
s
good
to
clear
up
the
legal
situation
but
there
s
a
danger
of
a
patchwork
of
widely
differing
regulations
he
said
germany
s
highest
federal
administrative
court
is
due
to
rule
on
tuesday
on
an
appeal
brought
by
german
states
against
bans
imposed
by
local
courts
in
stuttgart
and
duesseldorf
over
poor
air
quality
there
has
been
a
global
backlash
against
cars
since
volkswagen
admitted
in
to
cheating
exhaust
tests
meant
to
limit
emissions
of
particulate
matter
and
nitrogen
oxide
nox
known
to
cause
respiratory
disease
while
other
countries
are
also
considering
restrictions
on
diesel
cars
bans
in
germany
would
be
a
new
blow
for
the
car
industry
and
an
embarrassment
for
merkel
s
government
which
has
long
backed
the
industry
germany
for
many
years
promoted
diesel
to
help
cut
carbon
dioxide
emissions
and
meet
climate
change
goals
but
the
volkswagen
vw
scandal
has
pushed
its
to
step
up
spending
on
electric
cars
as
well
as
investments
into
making
diesel
engines
cleaner
merkel
s
government
has
previously
lobbied
against
bans
fearing
they
could
anger
millions
of
drivers
and
disrupt
traffic
