paris
reuters
french
nuclear
regulator
asn
said
it
has
told
edf
to
improve
the
running
of
the
construction
of
the
flamanville
nuclear
reactor
which
is
years
behind
schedule
and
billions
over
budget
the
asn
has
repeatedly
said
a
schedule
to
load
nuclear
fuel
at
the
epr
reactor
in
flamanville
which
is
the
same
type
as
edf
is
building
in
britain
s
hinkley
point
by
is
tight
asn
said
edf
must
improve
the
of
test
as
well
as
the
treatment
of
any
flaws
and
to
improve
the
information
flow
to
the
regulator
edf
has
promised
to
put
in
place
an
action
plan
to
remedy
these
dysfunctions
asn
said
in
a
statement
on
friday
the
asn
also
said
it
had
questioned
edf
and
framatome
the
company
formerly
called
areva
about
flaws
in
the
welding
of
the
flamanville
reactor
s
steam
pipes
edf
said
on
thursday
some
weldings
on
the
reactor
did
not
meet
specifications
but
said
this
would
not
affect
safety
or
the
schedule
to
load
fuel
asn
said
it
had
asked
edf
to
send
it
a
complete
study
about
the
discovery
and
impact
of
the
weldings
problem
and
that
it
would
consult
experts
about
it
in
the
second
half
of
in
june
the
asn
ruled
that
the
reactor
vessel
s
cover
was
fit
for
service
despite
weak
spots
in
its
steel
but
would
have
to
be
replaced
by
any
further
delay
to
flamanville
would
be
another
blow
to
the
image
of
the
epr
reactor
three
others
have
been
under
construction
for
years
in
finland
and
china
and
are
all
over
budget
and
schedule
it
could
also
force
edf
to
increase
its
cost
estimate
for
the
reactor
which
it
last
updated
to
billion
euros
in
september
from
an
original
estimate
of
billion
euros
delays
and
cost
overruns
at
the
flamanville
reactor
