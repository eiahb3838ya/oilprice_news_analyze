analysis-u.s. shale investors still waiting on payoff from oil boom
houston
reuters
oil
production
has
topped
million
barrels
per
day
approaching
a
record
set
in
but
many
investors
in
the
companies
driving
the
shale
oil
revolution
are
still
waiting
for
their
payday
shale
producers
have
raised
and
spent
billions
of
dollars
to
produce
more
oil
and
gas
ending
decades
of
declining
output
and
redrawing
the
global
energy
trade
map
but
most
shale
producers
have
failed
for
years
to
turn
a
profit
with
the
increased
output
frustrating
their
financial
backers
wall
street
s
patience
ran
out
late
last
year
as
investors
called
for
producers
to
shift
more
cash
to
dividends
and
share
buybacks
give
me
some
cash
that
s
what
investors
have
said
said
anoop
poddar
a
partner
at
private
equity
firm
energy
ventures
and
yet
such
calls
for
payouts
remain
a
debate
in
the
industry
as
oil
prices
have
recently
creeped
up
to
highs
investors
demanding
immediate
returns
could
risk
forcing
firms
to
curb
expansion
that
could
have
a
higher
payoff
if
oil
prices
continue
to
rise

the
global
impacts

the
shale
oil
boom
see
for
now
share
prices
of
shale
producers
have
yet
to
fully
recover
from
the
oil
price
collapse
when
many
investors
took
losses
as
hundreds
of
firms
went
bankrupt
and
those
that
survived
struggled
the
energy
sector
has
lagged
the
rally
that
took
the
broader
stock
market
to
record
highs
the
s
p
energy
index
remains
nearly
a
third
off
its
peak
in
when
oil
prices
topped
a
barrel
the
broader
s
p

is
up
percent
during
the
same
period
a
reuters
analysis
of
corporate
dividend
disclosures
shows
a
split
in
how
shale
firms
are
reacting
to
increased
pressure
from
investors
and
the
impact
on
their
market
value
this
year
five
of
the
largest
independent
shale
firms
have
started
paying
or
raised
quarterly
dividends
the
documents
show
but
six
of
the
firms
have
never
offered
a
dividend
or
have
not
restored
cuts
implemented
since
the
oil
price
collapse
anadarko
petroleum
corp
earlier
this
month
added
million
to
an
existing
buyback
program
and
raised
its
dividend
by
percent
sending
its
shares
up
percent
the
next
trading
day
buybacks
reduce
the
number
of
shares
outstanding
boosting
the
value
of
stock
that
remains
shares
in
pioneer
natural
resources
co
also
rose
percent
immediately
after
raising
its
dividend
and
posting
fourth

earlier

pioneer
s
chief

called
the
increase
a
step
toward
our
goal
of
returning

that
have
resisted

their

cimarex

four

including

kept

steady
through
the

a
pass
for
small

recent

have
eased
the

in
january
oil

jumped
to
a
barrel
up
percent
from
last
year
s
low
and
at
a
level
not
seen
in
four
years
since
then
prices
have
cooled
to
about
a
barrel
but
remain
percent
above
a
year
ago
boosting
cash
flow
for
firms
that
have
expanded
output
a
lot
of
these
smaller
companies
have
gotten
a
pass
for
outspending
cash
flow
due
to
their
very
high
growth
rates
said
todd
heltman
of
asset
manager
neuberger
berman
which
invests
in
shale
producers
shale
output
growth
continues
to
outpace
forecasts
the
energy
information
administration
this
month
said
united
states
production
could
top
million
barrels
per
day
by
the
end
of
a
year
earlier
than
it
had
expected
just
a
month
ago
heltman
has
pressed
shale
firms
to
show
restraint
even
amid
rising
prices
and
despite
higher
revenues
spending
increases
have
so
far
been
restrained
producers
have
pushed
up
spending
plans
for
all
of
by
percent
over
last
year
according
to
a
tally
of
of
the
producers
tracked
by
financial
services
firm
cowen
co
some
companies
have
maintained
conservative
assumptions
for
the
average
oil
price
for
budgeting
for
prices
between
and
a
barrel
a
higher
price
will
mean
they
can
cover
new
drilling
investments
and
still
pay
dividends
investors
are
searching
for
firms
that
can
find
the
optimal
balance
between
the
conflicting
goals
of
controlling
costs
paying
dividends
and
increasing
production
we
re
looking
to
invest
in
those
companies
who
have
been
able
to
improve
their
production
and
win
the
battle
as
far
as
cost
of
extraction
said
derek
rollingson
portfolio
manager
of
the
icon
energy
fund
which
holds
shares
of
more
than
a
dozen
shale
producers
a
further
rise
in
oil
prices
however
could
lead
investors
to
take
on
more
risk
and
penalize
more
conservative
companies
said
mike
breard
an
energy
analyst
at
hodges
capital
management
in
dallas
if
oil
is
by
easter
he
said
investors
are
going
to
go
to
the
companies
and
say
why
don
t
you
borrow
more
money
and
drill
more
wells
