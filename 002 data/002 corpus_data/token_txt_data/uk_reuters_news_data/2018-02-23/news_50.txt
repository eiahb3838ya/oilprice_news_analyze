mexico
s
presidential
frontrunner
is
not
opposed
to
foreign
investment
in
the
country
s
oil
his
top
energy
adviser
said
but
his
government
would
make
dramatic
changes
to
energy
strategy
including
a
new
focus
on
refining
rather
than
crude
exports
in
perhaps
the
most
significant
change
envisioned
by
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
the
favorite
to
win
the
july
election
mexico
would
seek
to
end
decades
of
exporting
crude
in
three
years
a
lawmaker
who
lopez
obrador
has
tapped
to
be
his
future
energy
minister
said
in
an
interview
instead
mexico
should
turn
its
focus
to
fuels
processing
crude
domestically
to
produce
more
gasoline
and
diesel
at
refineries
owned
by
state
oil
company
pemex
rocio
nahle
told
reuters
late
on
wednesday
in
a
period
at
the
latest
we
need
to
try
to
consume
our
own
fuels
and
not
depend
on
foreign
gasoline
said
nahle
at
her
congressional
office
in
mexico
city
that
could
spell
bad
news
for
refiners
mexico
is
their
biggest
foreign
market
currently
with
purchases
of
gasoline
and
diesel
growing
rapidly
in
recent
years
to
an
average
of
barrels
per
day
bpd
last
year
or
about
of
total
domestic
demand
according
to
pemex
data
pemex
s
total
crude
exports
mostly
to
gulf
coast
refiners
as
well
as
asian
and
european
buyers
averaged
million
bpd
in
down
from
a
peak
of
million
bpd
in
but
latin
american
countries
are
increasingly
seeking
to
add
value
to
their
exports
of
raw
commodities
nahle
gave
details
of
what
that
might
mean
for
mexico
modernizing
pemex
s
six
existing
refineries
and
building
one
or
two
new
ones
that
would
add
crude
processing
capacities
of
between
and
bpd
possible
sites
in
the
states
of
tabasco
and
campeche
had
been
identified
and
the
new
facilities
would
be
financed
by
either
public
funds
or
some
kind
of
partnership
she
said
we
are
doing
the
technical
economic
analysis
to
see
if
it
would
be
one
big
refinery
or
two
ones
said
nahle
a
petrochemical
engineer
who
represents
the
gulf
coast
state
of
veracruz
also
a
major
oil
producer
in
congress
a
lopez
obrador
government
would
aim
to
improve
the
existing
refineries
productivity
in
about
eight
months
solely
using
public
funds
nahle
said
pemex
refineries
currently
have
the
capacity
to
process
about
million
bpd
though
last
year
they
only
refined
about
bpd
the
company
produces
about
million
bpd
of
crude
down
from
a
peak
of
million
bpd
leftist
lopez
obrador
holds
a
lead
over
his
nearest
rival
in
many
opinion
polls
although
a
young
contender
has
been
gaining
ground
nahle
who
leads
lopez
obrador
s
morena
party
in
the
lower
house
of
congress
said
if
elected
their
government
would
closely
examine
all
the
deals
made
under
president
enrique
pena
nieto
s
oil
opening
but
welcomed
private
investment
we
in
morena
are
open
to
investment
we
are
open
to
the
world
nahle
said
lopez
obrador
initially
opposed
the
oil
reform
which
ended
pemex
s
monopoly
but
seems
to
have
softened
his
stance
since
the
changes
have
begun
to
be
implemented
to
date
some
exploration
and
production
contracts
have
been
awarded
to
a
wide
range
of
oil
companies
over
eight
auctions
including
nine
deepwater
blocks
won
by
royal
dutch
shell
at
a
tender
last
month
the
government
forecasts
that
the
companies
would
invest
around
billion
if
the
projects
are
commercially
successfully
over
the
lifetime
of
the
contracts
in
recent
months
lopez
obrador
has
said
that
he
would
review
the
contracts
to
make
sure
there
was
no
corruption
involved
nahle
said
his
team
had
already
looked
at
publicly
available
contracts
without
finding
problems
but
would
study
files
that
are
not
in
the
public
sphere
in
detail
if
they
win
the
election
if
a
lopez
obrador
government
were
to
determine
that
contracts
were
flawed
or
tainted
by
corruption
it
would
likely
not
authorize
future
oil
auctions
nahle
said
it
would
be
very
rash
for
me
to
tell
you
now
that
we
are
going
to
hand
over
more
blocks
no
or
to
say
we
are
never
going
to
do
more
blocks
said
nahle
we
will
see
at
every
moment
what
is
best
for
mexico
she
said
adding
that
the
current
government
had
been
irresponsible
by
auctioning
off
too
many
oil
and
gas
blocks
nowhere
in
the
world
have
we
seen
handed
over
to
private
oil
companies
such
a
stream
of
blocks
it
seems
like
an
excessive
rush
she
said
other
lopez
obrador
advisers
have
said
in
recent
days
that
the
team
was
happy
with
the
contracts
signed
under
the
outgoing
government
while
she
said
lopez
obrador
was
open
to
authorizing
more
equity
joint
ventures
with
pemex
also
allowed
by
the
energy
opening
nahle
stressed
the
need
for
pemex
to
seek
partnerships
outside
mexico
pemex
needs
to
go
to
asia
pemex
needs
to
go
to
texas
pemex
needs
to
go
to
south
america
to
find
partners
it
s
a
priority
for
us
that
pemex
is
truly
globalized
