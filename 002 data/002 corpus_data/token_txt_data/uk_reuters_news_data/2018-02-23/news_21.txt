said
commerzbank
rates
strategist
christoph
rieger
broader
concerns
have
lingered
globally
over
the
last
choppy
few
weeks
including
how
far
and
fast
interest
rates
may
rise
and
what
would
that
mean
for
global
borrowing
costs
risk
appetite
and
business
confidence
those
factors
helped
keep
yields
on
benchmark
treasury
notes
near
highs
this
week
although
yields
dropped
slightly
on
friday
the
notes
last
rose
in
price
to
yield
percent
from
percent
late
on
thursday
we
think
the
federal
reserve
could
well
put
rates
up
four
times
this
year
but
even
then
it
only
takes
rates
to
by
the
end
of
the
year
said
jpmorgan
asset
management
global
strategist
mike
bell
so
the
question
is
would
they
continue
at
that
pace
in
in
asian
trading
msci

japan
closed
percent
higher
while
japan
s
nikkei

percent
gold
s
spot
market
price
dropped
percent
to
an
ounce
it
has
so
far
shed
about
percent
this
week
its
biggest
weekly
decline
since
early
december
we
remain
somewhat
cautious
on
gold
over
the
short
term
given
that
we
think
the
dollar
rally
is
still
not
over
especially
in
the
light
of
treasury
yields
remaining
elevated
said
intl
fcstone
analyst
edward
meir
oil
edged
further
upwards
supported
by
a
dip
in
libyan
production
and
upbeat
comments
from
saudi
