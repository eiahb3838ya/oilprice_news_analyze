mongolia
has
struggled
with
pollution
in
its
capital
where
an
influx
of
herders
migrating
from
the
countryside
has
seen
the
population
double
in
less
than
two
decades
the
government
has
offered
subsidies
for
and
stoves
and
it
is
also
providing
free
electricity
at
night
in
some
districts
but
smog
levels
spike
in
the
bitterly
cold
winters
especially
in
poor
ger
neighborhoods
named
after
the
felt
tents
in
which
many
migrants
live
many
ger
households
burn
coal
or
even
trash
to
keep
warm
and
the
smog
they
produce
has
led
to
a
surge
in
respiratory
and
heart
disease
and
stoked
anger
and
protests
reducing
air
pollution
levels
is
the
only
sustainable
solution
to
protecting
children
s
health
heikens
said
in
the
meantime
thousands
of
children
will
continue
to
suffer
unless

action
