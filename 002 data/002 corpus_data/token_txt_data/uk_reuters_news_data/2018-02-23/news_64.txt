row over kenyan oil revenues threatens to delay production

in
the
decades
before
oil
was
discovered
in
the
northern
kenyan
region
of
turkana
south
poor
villagers
living
in
arid
scrubland
relied
on
a
lone
health
centre
in
lokichar
town
for
medical
help
since
tullow
oil
found
crude
there
six
years
ago
the
company
has
funded
a
referral
hospital
school
classrooms
and
dormitories
provided
village
water
points
graded
roads
and
paid
for
scholarships
to
generate
goodwill
seeing
the
potential
benefits
of
oil
residents
of
the
poorest
of
kenya
s
counties
now
want
the
central
government
to
make
up
for
decades
of
neglect
by
ploughing
nearly
a
third
of
expected
oil
revenues
back
into
turkana
the
central
government
has
other
ideas
parliament
passed
a
draft
bill
in
allocating
percent
of
any
state
oil
revenue
to
local
government
and
percent
to
communities
living
where
the
crude
was
discovered
leaving
percent
for
the
central
government
in
nairobi
but
president
uhuru
kenyatta
never
signed
the
bill
a
revised
version
due
to
be
debated
in
parliament
this
month
cuts
the
regional
government
share
to
percent
with
only
percent
for
local
communities
the
legislation
must
be
passed
before
oil
production
can
begin
kenyatta
s
jubilee
party
which
controls
of
parliament
s
seats
is
likely
to
back
the
revised
law
but
some
of
its
lawmakers
may
break
ranks
and
side
with
the
opposition
pushing
for
more
money
for
local
communities
now
that
they
have
suffered
for
so
long
the
revenue
from
oil
must
actually
feed
them
treat
them
and
take
their
children
to
school
said
jubilee
party
member
james
lomenen
member
of
parliament
for
turkana
south
lomenen
plans
to
table
an
amendment
to
the
petroleum
exploration
development
and
production
bill
to
restore
the
percent
share
to
local
communities
residents
see
the
new
terms
as
another
slap
in
the
face
for
turkana
a
vast
scrubland
the
size
of
sri
lanka
where
most
residents
live
in
villages
without
power
or
running
water
joseph
nachar
a
village
elder
in
loktorio
which
is
close
to
one
of
tullow
s
wells
said
locals
will
oppose
oil
companies
if
they
don
t
get
their
percent
he
vowed
to
vote
against
any
representative
who
doesn
t
fight
for
their
cut
in
demonstrators
backed
by
local
politicians
marched
on
drilling
sites
demanding
jobs
and
other
benefits
forcing
tullow
to
halt
work
for
two
weeks
we
are
the
owners
of
the
land
where
they
are
getting
oil
said
nachar
local
leaders
say
the
money
will
help
make
up
for
years
of
neglect
in
areas
such
as
health
and
education
turkana
s
literacy
rate
is
just
percent
while
the
national
average
is
more
than
percent
the
maternal
mortality
rate
in
kenya
was
for
every
live
births
in
but
in
turkana
it
was
above
the
children
s
fund
unicef
said
we
are
starting
from
scratch
said
jane
ajele
turkana
county
s
executive
committee
member
for
health
nairobi
officials
argue
that
turkana
s
economy
which
largely
depends
on
livestock
can
not
absorb
a
wave
of
cash
we
want
them
to
prosper
but
if
we
see
a
pitfall
somewhere
we
have
to
advise
people
said
andrew
kamau
principal
secretary
in
the
ministry
of
energy
and
petroleum
most
of
kenya
s
oil
blocks
have
not
been
explored
those
owned
by
tullow
and
its
partners
africa
oil
corp
and
total
sa
hold
an
estimated
million
barrels
while
that
s
less
than
african
frontier
oil
countries
such
as
uganda
and
ghana
exports
scheduled
to
start
in
would
earn
the
government
billion
a
year
at
peak
production
at
current
prices
government
officials
say
that
s
about
percent
of
annual
revenue
comparable
to
the
country
s
biggest
export
tea
the
petroleum
bill
would
also
create
a
sovereign
wealth
fund
financed
with
oil
revenues
which
the
government
says
it
would
manage
to
guard
against
currency
fluctuations
and
theft
but
turkana
residents
have
little
faith
the
government
tainted
by
a
series
of
corruption
scandals
will
manage
their
money
well
kenya
loses
a
third
of
its
state
budget
the
equivalent
of
about
billion
to
corruption
every
year
former
chief
philip
kinisu
told
reuters
in
the
government
denied
the
figure
and
kinisu
was
fired
five
months
after
giving
the
interview
his
successor
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
auditor
general
edward
ouko
has
also
accused
the
national
government
of
corruption
and
mismanagement
in
a
series
of
scathing
reports
he
has
been
equally
critical
of
county
authorities
set
up
in
to
help
counter
complaints
about
central
government
theft
about
percent
of
turkana
s
billion
shilling
million
budget
in
was
unaccounted
for
ouko
s
office
said
with
the
corruption
that
we
have
in
kenya
you
can
only
trust
what
goes
to
the
community
directly
said
mp
lomenen
tullow
has
already
spent
billion
shillings
million
on
community
projects
but
the
row
over
revenue
sharing
has
eaten
into
the
oil
companies
tight
timelines
the
clock
is
ticking
said
tullow
oil
kenya
country
manager
martin
mbogo
technical
studies
of
wells
in
the
lokichar
basin
were
due
to
start
last
year
but
have
been
delayed
so
has
early
oil
production
due
to
start
last
june
about
barrels
of
crude
were
to
be
trucked
out
daily
until
an
km
mile
pipeline
is
built
to
indian
ocean
ports
petroleum
ministry
official
kamau
said
delegations
including
community
representatives
would
visit
established
producers
such
as
nigeria
canada
and
oman
to
seek
advice
on
revenue
sharing
in
nigeria
percent
of
oil
revenue
goes
to
local
communities
though
that
has
not
stopped
attacks
on
oil
installations
by
those
wanting
more
the
rest
is
shared
out
among
the
three
tiers
of
the
nigerian
government
the
federal
branch
gets
percent
expectations
among
the
turkana
people
are
similarly
high
they
should
think
about
us
because
we
are
not
getting
any
help
at
all
