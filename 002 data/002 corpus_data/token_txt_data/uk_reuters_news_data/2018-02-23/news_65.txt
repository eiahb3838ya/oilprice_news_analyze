financial
markets
have
fluctuated
wildly
this
month
as
investors
fretted
about
how
fast
the
fed
might
raise
rates
in
the
wake
of
data
showing
a
pick
up
in
inflation
even
though
broader
price
pressures
still
appear
modest
for
now
markets
are
fully
pricing
in
three
rate
hikes
this
year
one
more
than
was
seen
just
a
few
months
ago
some
analysts
even
expect
four
that
in
turn
has
stoked
anxiety
that
many
central
banks
will
start
to
tighten
policy
and
raise
borrowing
costs
hurting
corporate
earnings
and
clouding

outlook

it

down
more

so

global

were
mauled

china

pared
early

after
the

seized

in
a
dramatic
move
that
underscores
beijing
s
intent
to
crackdown
on
financial
risk
the
gains
in
asia
followed
a
thursday
after
minutes
of
the
fed
s
last
meeting
showed
policy
makers
were
confident
about
the
economic
outlook
that
prompted
some
investors
to
boost
the
chance
of
faster

hikes
st
louis
fed
president
james
bullard
tried
to
tamp
down
expectations
of
four
rate
hikes
in
instead
of
the
widely
anticipated
three
saying
on
thursday
policymakers
need
to
be
careful
not
to
increase
rates
too
quickly
because
that
could
slow
the
economy
the
fed
had
caused
a
so
called
taper
tantrum
in
may
when
it
signalled
it
was
time
to
stop
pumping
cash
into
the
economy
a
move
that
created
havoc
in
financial
markets
particularly
asia
but
analysts
are
more
upbeat
about
the
outlook
for
the
region
despite
prospects
of
rising
inflation
and
rates
financial
market
volatility
has
not
dented
our
constructive
view
on
asia
s
growth
outlook
for
this

said
khoon

head

for
anz
higher
inflation
and
a
larger
fiscal
deficit
in
the
united
states
will
likely
see
bond
yields
move
higher
but
improved
fundamentals
in
asia
mean
the
region
is
better
placed
to
weather
