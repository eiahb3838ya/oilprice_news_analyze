whether
grappling
with
rising
sea
levels
drought
or
floods
mayors
of
cities
worldwide
are
increasingly
on
the
frontline
of
efforts
to
help
communities
prepare
better
for
the
impacts
of
climate
change
as
it
hikes
the
risk
of
disasters
with
cities
home
to
over
half
the
world
s
population
and
producing
more
than
percent
of
global
economic
output
mayors
are
also
driving
climate
action
by
adopting
renewable
energy
and
cleaner
methods
of
transport
jenny
durkan
mayor
of
the
city
of
seattle
said
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
walk
away
from
the
paris
agreement
a
global
pact
to
curb
climate
change
and
his
support
for
fossil
fuels
have
prompted
city
leaders
to
step
up
mayors
have
been
galvanised
in
america
and
now
will
be
taking
more
unified
steps
than
perhaps
they
would
have
been
when
they
had
to
rely
on
federal
partners
durkan
a
former
attorney
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
by
telephone
our
federal
government
unfortunately
has
completely
backed
away
from
all
their
commitments
on
climate
change
so
the
leadership
on
this
front
has
to
come
from
state
and
local
government
she
added
seattle
a
port
city
with
areas
already
faces
worsening
flood
risk
due
to
higher
seas
and
more
frequent
torrential
rains
exacerbated
by
global
warming
durkan
said
climate
change
is
huge
for
us
we
ve
had
extreme
weather
conditions
shifting
she
said
cities
are
not
going
to
to
help
curb
climate
change
seattle
is
focused
on
cutting
carbon
emissions
by
promoting
clean
energy
and
a
green
economy
a
key
source
of
jobs
durkan
said
this
means
a
move
away
from
burning
fossil
fuels
which
scientists
say
is
one
of
the
lead
causes
of
climate
change
towards
renewable
sources
of
power
durkan
highlighted
her
city
s
drive
to
get
more
electric
cars
on
the
road
with
the
recent
launch
of
new
electric
vehicle
charging
stations
and
parking
areas
taxis
are
next
on
the
list
initiatives
to
curb
climate
change
and
make
cities
more
resilient
to
disaster
threats
will
be
on
the
agenda
at
a
meeting
of
mayors
and
business
leaders
in
mexico
city
next
week
salt
lake
city
mayor
jackie
biskupski
one
of
a
group
of
female
mayors
attending
the
second
conference
organised
by
the
urban
climate
change
alliance
said
a
shift
in
snowfall
patterns
is
one
way
the
city
is
experiencing
climate
change
which
could
lead
to
drought
we
re
already
talking
about
what
we
need
to
do
on
making
sure
that
we
have
enough
water
for
the
year
including
cutting
down
water
usage
over
the
spring
time
said
biskupski
a
former
utah
democratic
state
lawmaker
salt
lake
city
is
gradually
switching
from
coal
as
a
source
of
power
to
renewables
like
solar
and
is
on
track
to
meet
its
goal
of
using
percent
renewable
energy
by
she
said
as
part
of
that
process
it
will
be
necessary
to
replace
jobs
in
communities
that
have
relied
on
the
coal
industry
for
employment
she
added
in
latin
america
making
cities
more
resilient
is
a
priority
as
they
are
home
to
about
percent
of
the
population
in
the
world
s
most
urbanised
region
according
to
the
united
nations
common
challenges
facing
latin
american
mayors
are
how
to
contain
urban
sprawl
combat
traffic
gridlock
and
cut
high
pollution
levels
but
with
the
world
s
most
violent
cities
and
highest
murder
rates
building
resilience
in
the
region
goes
beyond
heading
off
disasters
like
floods
to
coping
with
social
stresses
the
focus
on
crime
in
latin
america
is
still
very
high
said
isabel
beltran
associate
director
for
latin
america
and
the
caribbean
with
resilient
cities
a
project
backed
by
the
rockefeller
foundation
to
help
cities
face
up
to
pressures
crime
erodes
resilience
and
the
social
fabric
of
the
mayors
she
said
have
the
power
to
implement
change
and
strengthen
their
cities
but
more
investment
is
needed
one
of
the
challenges
is
to
have
a
line
of
budget
dedicated
to
resilience
beltran
said
for
maurice
armitage
mayor
of
cali
colombia
s
city
wider
access
to
education
is
key
to
fighting
crime
and
in
turn
making
the
city
safer
that
involves
getting
young
men
off
the
streets
away
from
gangs
and
into
schools
and
job
training
schemes
armitage
s
administration
is
investing
heavily
in
building
new
schools
with
features
in
addition
the
city
is
working
on
social
problems
our
jails
are
full
our
cemeteries
are
full
we
have
to
stop
that
