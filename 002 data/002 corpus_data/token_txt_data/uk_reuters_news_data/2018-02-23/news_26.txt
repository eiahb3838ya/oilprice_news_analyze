at
a
stage

imports
large
quantities

there
is
more
than
enough
market
for
our
products
and
there
is
enough
room
to
raise
bancila
said
the
company
would
embark
on
an
ambitious
development
and
expansion
program
from
with
the
goal
of
boosting
turnover
to
more

million
euros
within
five
years
the
expansion
would
be
driven
by
relaunching
oltchim
s
production
of
polyvinyl
chloride
pvc
which
will
require
investment
of
up
to
million
euros

consider
raising
capital

gas
minerals
industrial
platforms
labor
force

plenty
of
market
what

could
it
need
