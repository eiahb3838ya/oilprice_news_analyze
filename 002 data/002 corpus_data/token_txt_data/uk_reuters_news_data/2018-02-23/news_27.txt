i
ndustry
s
dependence
on
polluting
fossil
fuels
is
at
odds
with
a
revolution
in
transport
and
renewable
energy
and
could
stop
the
world
doing
a
crucial
on
rising
emissions
of
gases
by
a
former
climate
chief
warned
christiana
figueres
who
oversaw
work
on
the
paris
agreement
to
tackle
global
warming
now
leads
mission
an
international
initiative
that
seeks
to
put
greenhouse
gas
emissions
on
a
downward
path
by
we
re
definitely
not
on
track
with
everything
to
do
with
heavy
industry
that
continues
to
depend
on
intense
electricity
and
we
re
not
on
track
with
land
use
said
figueres
former
executive
secretary
of
the
framework
convention
on
climate
change
so
what
happens
if
we
don
t
get
there
is
we
increase
our
risk
and
increase
the
exposure
to
extreme
weather
events
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
an
interview
the
transport
and
energy
sectors
are
expected
to
meet
the
deadline
as
a
result
of
more
efficient
cleaner
transportation
and
a
plunge
in
the
cost
of
generating
renewable
power
figueres
said
putting
a
price
on
carbon
and
working
out
ways
to
pay
for
environmental
services
could
also
yield
benefits
alongside
incentives
to
improve
land
use
by
restoring
degraded
soils
or
boosting
reforestation
she
said
the
paris
agreement
set
a
goal
of
keeping
the
rise
in
average
global
temperatures
to
well
below
degrees
celsius
above
times
and
ideally
to
degrees
science
has
warned
us
that
if
we
do
not
get
to
that
point
and
begin
to
bend
the
emissions
curve
we
will
have
accelerated
negative
impacts
of
climate
change
figueres
said
despite
the
challenges
to
the
mission
goal
figueres
cautioned
against
relying
on
controversial
geoengineering
techniques
to
try
to
cool
the
planet
s
temperature
negative
emissions
technologies
to
suck
carbon
back
out
of
the
atmosphere
could
involve
capturing
gases
and
storing
them
underground
or
fertilising
oceans
to
make
them
absorb
more
carbon
dioxide
other
techniques
being
discussed
include
mimicking
the
activity
of
volcanoes
by
spraying
chemicals
into
the
earth
s
upper
atmosphere
many
scientists
fear
those
methods
could
be
risky
have
limited
success
and
distract
from
urgent
efforts
to
cut
emissions
our
biosphere
our
forests
our
whole
plant
kingdom
is
the
best
carbon
absorption
mechanism
we
have
on
this
planet
it
s
the
safest
it
doesn
t
have
any
negative
impacts
and
we
just
have
not
yet
extracted
all
the
benefits
said
figueres
before
we
go
to
industrial
or
chemical
engineering
the
side
effects
of
which
we
have
no
idea
the
cost
of
which
we
have
no
idea
i
would
prefer
to
first
exhaust
the
possibility
of
all
the
technologies
we
do
figueres
from
costa
rica
will
join
female
mayors
in
mexico
city
on
monday
for
the
second
conference
organised
by
the
urban
climate
change
alliance
the
meeting
will
bring
together
mayors
and
business
leaders
to
discuss
the
role
women
can
play
in
curbing
climate
change
and
making
communities
more
resilient
to
its
impacts
a
push
by
cities
in
the
united
states
to
join
states
and
corporations
in
moving
forward
with
action
to
tackle
climate
change
is
a
counterbalance
to
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
pull
his
country
out
of
the
paris
deal
said
figueres
the
united
states
is
in
a
whopping
collection
of
one
country
the
only
country
in
the
world
that
has
said
it
would
like
to
leave
the
paris
agreement
she
said
it
has
had
a
minimal
impact
internationally
as
no
other
country
has
decided
to
follow
suit
she
added
at
the
individual
level
more
people
could
be
spurred
to
take
climate
action
by
highlighting
the
benefits
clean
technology
can
bring
which
are
poised
to
be
even
more
significant
than
with
the
communications
boom
she
said
people
tend
to
think
it
complex
it
unfixable
somebody
else
should
do
it
said
figueres
but
this
is
the
most
exciting
thing
that
has
happened
to
us
in
a
long
time
