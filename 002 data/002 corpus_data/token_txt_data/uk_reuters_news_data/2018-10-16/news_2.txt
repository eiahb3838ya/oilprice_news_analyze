edged
up
in
cautious
trade
on
tuesday
as
expectations
of
higher

vied
with
worries
that
crude
supply
from
the
middle
east
could
be
disrupted
by
looming
sanctions
on
iran
and
growing
tensions
with
top

did
not
know
what
happened
in
the
turkish
consulate
where
khashoggi
apparently
disappeared
the
focus
within
the
oil
trade
during
the
next
couple
of
weeks
is
likely
to
be
on
iran
and
saudi
arabia
jim
ritterbusch
president
of
ritterbusch

associates
said
in
a
note
we
don
t
expect
the
kingdom
to
be
as
accommodative
to
the
white
house
requests
for
stronger
production
he
said
adding
that
the
saudis
could
cut
as
much
as
barrels
per
day
of
production
as
a
warning
shot
should
the
opt
to
impose
any
type
of
sanction
in
response
to
the
khashoggi
trump
has
urged
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
to
raise
output
to
help
cover
a
shortfall
due
to
new
sanctions
on
iran
the
market
has
been
supported
by
reports
that
iranian
crude
exports
may
be
falling
faster
than
expected
ahead

sanctions

last

oil
prices
slumped
as
global
stock
markets
fell
but
a
recovery
in
financial
markets
boosted
by

growth
helped
provide
support
to
oil
prices
on
tuesday
traders
said
prices
extended
gains
in
trade
after
data
from
the
american
petroleum
institute
api
showed
a
surprise
decline
in
crude
inventories
stockpiles
fell
million

last
week
versus
forecasts
for
a
build
stocks
at
the
cushing

for

rose
by
million
barrels
the
api
said
the
fourth
straight
week
of
increases
if
confirmed
by
official
data
due
at
edt
gmt
on
wednesday
weak
gasoline
margins
and
growing
shale
output
could
also
cap
gains
in
crude
prices
market
participants
said
the
weakening
crude
spreads
almost
globally
in
the
face
of
iran
sanctions
is
likely
generating
some
concern
on
how
strong
market
really
is
and
if
it
s
ready
to
rally

in
about

we
think
that
one
of
the
major
factors
that
is
leading
to
a
scaling
back
of

is
a
reappraisal
of

said
in

note
any

deficit
in

was
unlikely
to
be
large
enough
to
do
