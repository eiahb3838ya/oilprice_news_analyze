outokumpu
s
tornio
facility
in
finland
one
of
europe
s
biggest
steel
plants
has
suffered
four
radiation
contamination
incidents
since
july
the
country
s
nuclear
watchdog
stuk
said
on
tuesday
in
the
latest
incident
a
batch
of
scrap
metal
at
the
plant
was
found
on
to
contain
americium
a
radioactive
element
that
can
be
dangerous
and
potentially
deadly
if
inhaled
or
swallowed
by
employees
workers
were
forced
to
wear
oxygen
masks
but
were
not
exposed
to
radiation
stuk
said
the
concentration
strength
was
about
gigabecquerels
it
said
adding
that
the
events
recurrence
qualifies
as
an
international
nuclear
event
scale
ines
radiation
incident
outokumpu
takes
this
matter
seriously
and
does
its
utmost
to
prevent
radioactive
material
ending
up
in
production
the
company
said
radioactive
material
is
strictly
prohibited
and
can
not
be
accepted
at
the
all
four
recent
incidents
involved
americium
according
to
stuk
it
seems
there
is
a
bigger
portion
of
scrap
metal
around
the
world
that
contains
americium
stuk
director
tommi
toivonen
said
it
is
really
difficult
to
find
unlike
other
radioactive
the
firm
said
it
has
addressed
the
issue
with
its
suppliers
but
declined
to
name
them
when
asked
by
reuters
stuk
said
in
the
oct
incident
the
contaminated
materials
were
shipped
from
the
netherlands
and
the
baltics
but
were
likely
to
have
originated
outside
europe
outokumpu
said
output
was
unaffected
and
products
were
not
contaminated
the
origin
of
the
imported
scrap
metal
is
not
tracked
and
the
presence
of
radioactivity
could
be
accidental
or
a
deliberate
way
to
get
rid
of
contaminated
materials
stuk
said
it
is
a
serious
incident
there
is
a
risk
for
employee
safety
toivonen
said
they
cleared
it
out
but
now
they
have
hundreds
of
tons
of
radioactive
waste
to
get
rid
the
company
said
its
contracts
with
suppliers
of
scrap
metal
clearly
prohibit
radioactive
material
but
said
it
can
in
some
cases
be
very
hard
to
detect
