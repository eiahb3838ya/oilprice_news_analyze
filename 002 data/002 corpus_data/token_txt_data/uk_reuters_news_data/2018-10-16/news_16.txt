a
japanese
brokerage
the
refiners
announced
in

they
had
finally
reached
a

year
after
idemitsu
s
founding
family
dropped
its
opposition
to
the
plan
idemitsu
japan
s
oil
refiner
by
sales
has
long
been
keen
to
merge
its
operations
with
showa
shell
in
response
to
shrinking
gasoline
demand
in
the
country
the
combined
firm
would
account
for
about
percent
of
japan
s
domestic
gasoline
sales
second
only
to
jxtg
holdings
which
controls
about
half
the
market

the
companies
said
idemitsu

for
each
showa
shell
share
idemitsu
will
be
the
surviving
entity
with
showa
shell
shares
to
be
delisted

on
the

idemitsu
s
closing
price
on

showa
shell
is
valued
at
yen
per
share
a
slight
discount
to
its

that
puts
the
deal
value
at
about
billion

idemtisu
president
shunichi
kito
who
will
serve
as
president
of
the
combined
firm
ruled
out
combining
the
group
s
seven
refineries
in
japan
with
total
crude
refining
capacity
of
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
as
all
were
competitive
with
room
for
exports
the
new
firm
has
a
higher
ratio
of
residue
cracking
capability
at
its
refineries
than
rivals
he
said
the
group
could
raise
the
capacity
of
heavy
oil
processing
units
at
idemitsu
s
chiba
refinery
in
response
to
the
international
maritime
organization
s
move
to
ban
use
of
high
sulfur
fuel
