bangladesh
s
electricity
generation
from
renewable
sources
has
passed
the
percent
mark
with
the
opening
of
a
major
new
solar
plant
boosting
hopes
the
country
might
meet
its
goal
of
getting
percent
of
power
from
renewables
by
experts
say
the
new
megawatt
solar
power
plant
in
cox
s
bazar
district
is
the
largest
yet
opened
in
the
country
following
the
earlier
construction
of
a
mw
plant
the
solar
plants
come
on
top
of
the
widespread
use
of
solar
home
systems
in
the
country
considered
one
of
those
most
vulnerable
to
climate
change
impacts
currently
about
million
solar
home
systems
provide
electricity
to
almost
percent
of
bangladesh
s
million
people
dipal
barua
president
of
the
bangladesh
solar
and
renewable
energy
association
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
he
called
the
new
plant
good
news
for
the
country
saying
the
accelerating
construction
of
solar
power
facilities
will
build
confidence
among
future
investors
the
new
solar
park
will
supply
enough
electricity
to
meet
about
percent
of
power
demand
in
the
teknaf
where
it
is
located
said
mahmudul
hasan
chief
financial
officer
for
joules
power
that
area
has
about
power
users
though
little
in
the
way
of
industrial
or
large
commercial
users
he
said
nuher
latif
khan
managing
director
of
technaf
solartech
energy
a
subsidiary
of
joules
power
that
owns
the
plant
said
the
plant
had
begun
operations
ahead
of
schedule
in
bangladesh
the
future
of
solar
power
is
very
fantastic
he
said
noting
that
company
definitely
planned
to
invest
more
in
renewable
energy
including
potentially
wind
power
khan
said
the
solar
park
can
produce
up
to
mw
of
solar
electricity
at
peak
capacity
and
has
contracted
to
provide
mw
to
the
government
grid
barua
said
several
other
large
solar
plants
are
in
the
pipeline
in
bangladesh
after
receiving
government
approval
with
a
few
at
advanced
stages
of
construction
more
cost
then
less
while
solar
plants
need
a
large
amount
of
initial
investment
to
set
up
he
said
they
have
very
small
operational
costs
afterward
unlike
plants
that
need
ongoing
sources
of
coal
or
other
fossil
fuels
the
government
has
supported
the
construction
of
rooftop
solar
plants
on
factories
and
other
commercial
buildings
he
said
with
some
facilities
on
large
plants
expected
to
generate
a
megawatt
or
more
each
with
such
solar
plants
thousands
of
factories
in
bangladesh
should
be
able
to
meet
their
own
electricity
needs
and
contribute
surplus
power
to
the
national
grid
i
think
one
day
we
will
see
every
building
has
a
rooftop
solar
power
system
barua
said
however
finding
available
land
to
set
up
solar
plants
is
a
major
challenge
in
densely
populated
bangladesh
he
admitted
sheikh
reaz
ahmed
director
of
the
sustainable
and
renewable
energy
development
authority
sreda
said
the
country
s
renewable
energy
policy
calls
for
generating
percent
of
electricity
from
renewables
by
with
the
country
expected
to
generate
mw
of
electricity
in
total
by
the
date
renewables
would
have
to
reach
mw
to
hit
that
target
he
said
so
far
bangladesh
generates
just
over
mw
from
renewables
nearly
half
of
that
from
hydropower
plants
he
said
but
the
country
is
set
to
put
online
another
mw
of
renewable
power
in
alone
he
said
with
another
mw
rolled
out
in
and
altogether
plants
now
in
the
pipeline
should
bring
the
country
s
renewable
energy
generating
capacity
to
mw
by
ahmed
said
not
all
the
construction
is
progressing
smoothly
however
with
some
plants
tied
up
in
problems
with
land
acquisition
and
other
issues
he
said
meanwhile
energy
generation
from
fossil
fuels
also
is
rising
to
meet
soaring
demand
for
energy
in
bangladesh
he
said
last
year
bangladesh
s
cabinet
committee
on
public
procurement
approved
a
proposal
to
construct
new
power
plants
capable
of
generating
mw
of
electricity
in
january
construction
also
began
on
a
mw
power
plant
in
cox
s
bazar
funded
by
the
japan
international
cooperation
agency
that
means
boosting
bangladesh
percentage
of
renewable
energy
above
percent
wo
be
easy
because
each
year
total
power
generation
from
traditional
sources
will
go
up
too
