update 3-volvo warns some vehicle engines may exceed emission limits
stockholm
reuters
sweden
s
volvo
warned
on
tuesday
that
some
of
its
truck
and
bus
engines
could
be
exceeding
limits
for
nitrogen
oxide
emissions
as
an
emissions
control
component
it
uses
was
degrading
more
quickly
than
expected
sending
its
shares
lower
the
company
which
makes
trucks
construction
equipment
and
buses
said
the
largest
volume
of
potentially
affected
engines
had
been
sold
in
north
america
and
europe
its
two
largest
markets
and
that
costs
to
fix
the
problem
could
be
material
the
issue
could
become
an
added
headache
for
volvo
which
has
been
working
hard
to
protect
profitability
after
a
surge
in
demand
in
europe
and
north
america
caused
supply
chain
bottlenecks
inflating
costs
for
raw
materials
and
labour
several
countries
have
in
recent
years
set
ambitious
goals
to
cut
carbon
dioxide
and
nitrogen
oxide
emissions
bringing
carmakers
and
truckmakers
under
greater
scrutiny
the
car
industry
was
rocked
by
the
dieselgate
emissions
scandal
after
germany
s
volkswagen
was
forced
to
pay
hefty
fines
after
admitting
to
systematic
emissions
cheating
volkswagen
which
has
pegged
the
financial
toll
at
over
billion
is
still
dealing
with
the
fallout
of
the
scandal
there
was
no
indication
on
tuesday
that
volvo
had
cheated
or
hidden
any
emissions
related
information
from
authorities
volvo
said
all
products
equipped
with
the
component
met
emissions
limits
at
delivery
and
that
its
probe
so
far
indicated
that
the
degradation
was
not
affecting
all
vehicles
and
engines
in
the
same
way
and
to
the
same
extent
the
company
had
begun
speaking
to
relevant
authorities
in
europe
and
north
america
where
emission
regulations
are
strictest
a
spokesman
said
an
european
commission
spokeswoman
said
the
body
would
contact
the
swedish
authorities
to
gather
more
information
while
reuters
was
not
immediately
able
to
reach
north
american
authorities
outside
of
regular
business
hours
the
problem
was
with
a
catalyst
converter
sourced
from
an
external
provider
volvo
investor
relations
director
anders
christensson
said
declining
to
name
the
provider
or
say
whether
volvo
would
terminate
the
relationship
in
certain
applications
when
the
engine
is
not
running
hot
enough
you
get
condensation
water
in
there
and
that
causes
this
problem
you
get
a
warning
signal
in
the
dashboard
saying
you
re
running
above
nitrogen
oxide
levels
he
explained
kepler
cheuvreux
analyst
mats
liss
said
the
question
was
whether
the
whole
catalyst
needed
to
be
replaced
or
just
one
component
estimating
the
total
cost
for
volvo
would
be
at
least
a
couple
of
thousands
of
crowns
per
truck
instantly
the
volvo
spokesman
said
there
were
no
plans
yet
to
recall
any
vehicles
and
had
not
been
asked
by
authorities
to
do
so
volvo
sold
trucks
in
europe
and
north
america
last
year
and
reported
operating
income
of
billion
swedish
crowns
the
company
s
shares
were
down
percent
at
pence
on
gmt
making
it
easily
the
biggest
lower
on
stockholm
s
bluechip
index
on
tuesday
it
is
due
to
report
results
on
friday
analysts
also
speculated
that
an
external
supplier
could
mean
that
the
problem
was
widespread
and
hit
german
truck
rivals
volkswagen
and
daimler
volkswagen
and
daimler
did
not
immediately

calls
