update 4-german carmakers have 50:50 chance of facing detroit's fate, vw says

german
carmakers
only
have
a
percent
chance
of
surviving
as
leading
players
in
the
auto
industry
unless
they
transform
their
businesses
to
meet
new
regulations
and
adapt
supply
chains
volkswagen
s
chief
executive
said
on
tuesday
car
manufacturers
have
complained
about
new
regulations
including
bans
on
older
diesel
vehicles
in
german
cities
and
broader
eu
measures
to
cut
car
emissions
saying
they
will
hurt
europe
s
car
industry
and
cost
jobs
if
you
look
at
the
former
bastions
of
the
auto
industry
like
detroit
or
turin
you
understand
what
happens
to
cities
when
corporations
and
leading
industries
falter
ceo
herbert
diess
told
an
auto
suppliers
conference
in
wolfsburg
vw
s
manufacturing
base
germany
s
auto
industry
association
vda
has
said
a
ban
on
combustion
vehicles
in
would
threaten
more
than
german
industrial
jobs
of
which
are
at
car
companies
and
their
suppliers
tougher
rules
could
push
some
carmakers
out
of
business
due
to
the
pace
of
reforms
required
to
shift
production
to
electric
cars
and
to
tackle
new
geopolitical
threats
said
diess
from
today
s
point
of
view
the
chances
are
perhaps
that
the
german
auto
industry
will
still
belong
among
the
global
elite
in
years
time
he
said
referring
to
leading
players
volkswagen
group
bmw
and
daimler
european
union
lawmakers
have
agreed
to
seek
a
percent
cut
in
car
emissions
by
a
higher
level
than
germany
had
sought
after
a
report
called
for
dramatic
steps
to
slow
global
warming
germany
s
bmw
audi
and
mercedes
brands
command
around
a
percent
market
share
in
the
premium
auto
segment
but
a
push
to
cut
emissions
hurts
high
horsepower
vehicles
and
therefore
german
brands
in
particular
volkswagen
is
already
struggling
to
overcome
its
emissions
cheating
scandal
its
premium
unit
audi
was
fined
million
euros
million
on
tuesday
for
emissions
violations
we
are
all
used
to
the
fact
that
we
have
flourishing
industrial
metropolises
around
the
central
manufacturing
plants
of
german
carmakers
and
their
suppliers
places
where
people
like
to
live
and
work
but
that
s
not
guaranteed
for
eternity
diess
said
to
cut
average
fleet
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
in
europe
by
percent
by
volkswagen
needs
to
raise
its
share
of
fully
electric
vehicles
to
percent
of
new
car
sales
or
to
half
in
the
event
of
a
percent
cut
diess
said
the
push
to
cut
vehicle
carbon
dioxide
emissions
the
main
greenhouse
gas
blamed
for
global
warming
is
costly
and
would
ultimately
lead
to
a
rise
in
pollution
in
germany
given
the
country
s
dependence
on
generating
electricity
from
brown
coal
he
said
the
shift
from
combustion
engines
to
electric
cars
would
also
cost
jobs
at
vw
by
diess
said
requiring
an
overhaul
of
the
carmaker
s
components
business
it
is
clear
to
us
all
that
the
structural
shift
will
lead
to
fewer
auto
industry
jobs
in
germany
the
question
is
how
quickly
do
we
need
to
implement
this
structural
change
he
said
jobs
will
disappear
because
it
takes
less
time
to
build
an
electric
car
than
a
conventional
one
and
because
jobs
will
shift
overseas
to
makers
of
batteries
a
combustion
car
has
components
in
its
motor
exhaust
system
and
transmission
an
electric
car
s
battery
and
motor
has
only
components
according
to
analysts
at
ing
in
europe
there
are
about
plants
making
combustion
engines
employing
people
the
largest
engine
plant
in
europe
is
volkswagen
s
factory
in
kassel
so
far
german
carmakers
have
sourced
battery
cells
from
asian
suppliers
like
lg
chem
and
samsung
sdi
which
are
currently
supplying
audi
and
bmw
vw
is
overhauling
its
components
division
which
eats
up
the
lion
s
share
of
the
billion
euros
billion
spent
on
procurement
develops
and
builds
car
parts
at
sites
across
the
globe
and
employs
about
people
from
onward
volkswagen
components
will
act
as
an
economically
independent
entity
diess
said
each
of
the
plants
would
be
free
to
evaluate
partnerships
and
even
to
build
components
for
other
carmakers
