chinese
exporters
are
mostly
confident
they
can
weather
a
trade
war
with
the
united
states
but
worry
about
collateral
damage
it
might
cause
throughout
the
global
economy
according
to
a
reuters
poll
of
participants
at
china
s
largest
trade
fair
representatives
from
firms
involved
in
sectors
ranging
from
industrial
machinery
to
home
appliances
motorcycles
and
new
energy
vehicles
were
surveyed
during
the
canton
import
and
export
fair
on
oct
just
over
percent
said
they
were
worried
about
the
trade
war
in
the
first
poll
carried
out
by
reuters
since
the
united
states
imposed
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
late
last
month
escalating
the
tariff
war
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
we
wanted
to
expand
this
year
into
the
united
states
but
the
trade
war
has
really
thrown
a
spanner
in
the
works
said
heidi
tan
sales
director
at
motoma
power
which
makes
batteries
for
mobile
phones
including
iphones
phone
batteries
have
been
hit
by
tariffs
and
tan
says
customers
are
already
looking
to
buy
from
other
countries
it
is
only
be
a
matter
of
time
before
factories
in
southeast
asia
will
be
able
to
make
the
same
batteries
she
said
still
firms
surveyed
remained
broadly
optimistic
about
foreign
markets
despite
mounting
challenges
with
only
percent
expecting
orders
to
decline
this
year
and
just
percent
expecting
declines
in
when
the
fair
which
draws
thousands
of
companies
was
last
held
in
april
a
reuters
poll
found
percent
of
respondents
were
concerned
about
escalating
trade
tensions
and
only
percent
had
anticipated
a
trade
war
in
the
latest
survey
more
than
percent
expected
the
trade
war
to
last
at
least
another
year
though
some
said
it
depends
on
how
long
president
donald
trump
remains
in
the
white
house
the
question
isn
t
how
long
the
trade
war
will
last
said
charles
zhu
of
taizhou
jieba
cleaning
products
the
question
is
how
long
will
trump
be
in
power
percent
of
respondents
said
the
government
should
proactively
engage
in
discussions
to
try
to
end
the
trade
war
just
three
respondents
thought
china
should
retaliate
by
restricting
competition
one
massive
advantage
china
has
is
our
ability
to
work
hard
and
endure
hardship
we
thrive
under
competition
said
michael
zhuo
of
yuyao
ghost
audio
adding
around
two
thirds
of
his
customers
are
in
the
united
states
i
m
not
sure
whether
the
has
factored
this
into
their
just
under
half
of
the
firms
surveyed
had
no
business
in
the
united
states
effect
many
exporters
in
sectors
like
solar
power
and
machinery
said
their
shipments
to
the
united
states
were
negligible
partly
as
a
result
of
previous
punitive
tariffs
that
forced
them
to
look
at
markets
elsewhere
but
some
exporters
still
expressed
worries
over
how
the
trade
war
was
undermining
confidence
globally
the
trade
war
first
of
all
hurts
the
chinese
economy
where
we
have
customers
and
it
could
also
affect
the
economies
of
the
countries
we
do
business
with
said
todd
cao
of
jiangsu
spanl
ltd
which
exports
building
materials
partly
as
a
result
of
the
trade
conflict
economists
polled
by
reuters
earlier
this
month
predicted
that
china
s
growth
be
its
weakest
since
the
global
financial
crisis
and
for
many
exporters
surveyed
the
rising
costs
of
doing
business
in
china
including
growing
costs
of
raw
materials
and
high
staff
turnover
were
more
worrying
than
the
trade
war
respondents
also
listed
problems
like
the
crackdown
on
lending
and
tightening
environmental
regulations
some
exporters
said
customers
in
emerging
market
economies
were
suffering
from
a
squeeze
on
dollars
that
made
it
harder
for
them
to
buy
their
products
orders
from
turkey
south
africa
argentina
iran
syria
and
libya
are
all
down
said
tory
mak
a
sales
manager
at
guangzhou
hd
electronics
blaming
weakening
economic
conditions
in
these
countries
and
effects
from
the
trade
war
some
firms
not
directly
hurt
by
the
new
tariff
regime
were
suffering
the
effects
of
other
policy
shifts
including
the
imposition
of
sanctions
on
iran
firms
in
the
textiles
electric
equipment
and
solar
sectors
all
said
that
their
business
was
suffering
because
they
were
no
longer
allowed
to
export
to
the
middle
eastern
country
we
ve
not
been
hit
by
the
tariffs
but
by
the
sanctions
which
have
cut
our
trade
with
iran
to
zero
said
one
sales
manager
who
did
not
want
to
be
