s
leftist
pushed
the
companies
to
prove
themselves
by
quickly
pumping
oil
from
recent
finds
sources
say
but
gave
no
sign
of
offering
up
new
fields
to
reverse
dwindling
output
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
repeated
a
promise
to
respect
more
than
existing
contracts
awarded
following
a
sweeping
energy
overhaul
as
long
as
a
review
by
his
team
finds
no
corruption
and
he
added
companies
must
show
results
three
executives
who
attended
the
meeting
said
for
independent
talos
energy
which
is
developing
a
big
offshore
discovery
announced
last
year
along
with
partners
premier
oil
and
sierra
oil
gas
lopez
obrador
s
message
was
clear
quickly
bring
new
streams
of
production
online
we
know
we
have
to
exceed
expectations
and
we
re
trying
to
make
sure
we
do
that
said
talos
energy
ceo
tim
duncan
one
of
the
executives
who
attended
the
session
at
the
meeting
the
also
criticized
the
constitutional
reform
for
failing
to
stop
an
extended
output
slide
operators
such
as
talos
and
italy
s
eni
which
also
announced
a
major
offshore
find
last
year
are
on
lopez
obrador
s
watch
list
to
pump
oil
quickly
said
carlos
pascual
a
former
ambassador
to
mexico
who
now
helps
run
consultancy
ihs
markit
s
global
energy
business
the
focus
on
increased
barrels
is
going
to
create
greater
pressure
for
some
companies
he
said
the
oil
and
gas
blocks
awarded
in
bidding
rounds
over
the
past
three
years
to
companies
including
royal
dutch
shell
and
chevron
will
result
in
billion
in
new
investment
the
outgoing
government
estimates
lopez
obrador
s
pick
to
be
the
new
oil
minister
rocio
nahle
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
about
lopez
obrador
s
presentation
at
the
meeting
lopez
obrador
also
explained
he
intends
to
put
some
idle
drilling
rigs
belonging
to
a
few
mexican
service
firms
to
work
for
state
giant
pemex
according
to
three
executives
who
attended
the
meeting
the
executives
who
asked
not
to
be
named
to
avoid
any
from
the
incoming
government
said
they
were
surprised
at
the
decision
to
talk
up
the
service
contracts
for
pemex
instead
of
encouraging
much
bigger
investments
the
oil
companies
are
capable
of
making
a
former
senior
executive
with
pemex
said
the
plan
could
add
at
most
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
mexico
s
million
bpd
production
in
a
year
far
short
of
the
percent
increase
to
million
bpd
he
is
targeting
during
his
six
year
term
lopez
obrador
is
a
critic
of
the
energy
reform
that
brought
major
oil
companies
to
mexico
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
years
and
has
warned
he
will
not
offer
up
more
areas
for
auction
oil
companies
still
hope
he
will
soften
that
position
in
order
to
meet
his
ambitious
production
goals
the
veteran
leftist
politician
adopted
a
diplomatic
tone
at
the
industry
session
said
the
company
executives
and
his
team
even
pledged
to
ease
regulatory
delays
companies
face
reality
could
force
pragmatism
said
an
oil
executive
who
attended
the
meeting
arguing
it
is
highly
unlikely
mexico
could
meet
lopez
obrador
s
lofty
output
goal
with
government
spending
alone
as
an
indicator
firms
are
closely
watching
whether
oil
auctions
set
for
february
by
mexico
s
independent
oil
regulator
will
be
canceled
or
postponed
after
lopez
obrador
takes
office
in
december
if
that
happens
along
with
the
pledge
to
focus
production
plans
on
squeezing
more
out
of
pemex
fields
with
local
rigs
outside
investment
could
cool
for
years
in
mexico
s
oil
patch
home
to
shale
plays
and
the
country
s
potentially
lucrative
deepwater
gulf
of
mexico
according
to
the
executives
and
sector
analysts
the
head
of
the
oil
regulator
juan
carlos
zepeda
has
said
pemex
would
need
to
dedicate
billion
each
year
to
exploration
and
production
activities
to
hit
lopez
obrador
s
output
goal
about
double
this
year
s
budget
advisor
rocio
nahle
lopez
obrador
s
pick
to
be
energy
minister
said
last
month
pemex
will
be
allocated
about
billion
for
exploration
and
drilling
in
without
going
into
detail
the
nearly
two
hour
meeting
between
lopez
obrador
and
oil
company
executives
ended
with
a
promise
to
maintain
continuous
dialogue
going
forward
however
there
was
no
period
and
following
the
set
speeches
lopez
obrador
and
his
senior
energy
aides
quickly
departed
no
new
meetings
have
yet
been
scheduled
one
attendee
bluntly
quipped
afterwards
he
really
doesn
t
