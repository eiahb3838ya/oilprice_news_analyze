higher
on

as
focus
turned
to

season
and
a
rebound
in
italian
assets
helped
battered
equities
find
firmer
ground
for
now
european
shares
rallied
percent
pulling
away
from
monday
s
lows
that
followed
gains
in
some
asian
markets
led
by
japan
s
nikkei
index
which
closed
percent
higher
after
a
decline
of
nearly
percent
the
previous
day
the
positive
tone
looked
poised
to
extend
into
the
session
with
stock
futures
trading
higher
gains
in
italy
s
bond
and
stock
markets
after
italian
economy
minister
giovanni
tria
defended
the
country
s
expansionary
budget
helped
lift
sentiment
calm
in
italy
a
major
source
of
turbulence
in
world
markets
in
recent
weeks
helped
explain
the
recovery
in
risk
appetite
on
tuesday
said
marchel
alexandrovich
european
financial
economist
at
jefferies
in
london
stock
market
sentiment
in
europe
also
got
a
boost
from
expectations
that
earnings
season
will
deliver
earnings
growth
for
the
third
quarter
about
percent
of
companies
in
the
stoxx
index
are
due
to
report
results
this
week
with
the
earnings
season
passing
its
during
the
first
week
of
november
overall
earnings
for
the
index
are
expected
to
have
risen
percent
according
to
refinitiv
data
while
euro
zone
earnings
are
seen
up
percent
that
compares
with
the
percent
growth
seen
for
companies
if
you
look
at
what
s
happening
here
and
now
it
is
an
improvement
from
what
was
happening
a
week
ago
alexandrovich
said
how
long
the
stability
lasts
is
anyone
s
calmer
equity
markets
took
the
shine
off
assets
japan
s
yen
was
down
a
quarter
of
a
percent
against
the
dollar
the
swiss
franc
edged
away
from
almost
highs
against
the
greenback
and
gold
dipped
from
monday
s
high
as
tension
between
the
west
and
saudi
arabia
triggered
a
fresh
exit
out
of
risk
assets
signs
that
saudi
arabia
is
preparing
to
acknowledge
the
death
of
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
in
a
botched
interrogation
helped
smooth
edgy
markets
but
given
a
rout
in
stock
markets
last
week
fuelled
in
part
by
concerns
about
higher
interest
rates
rising
treasury
yields
and
world
trade
tensions
some
caution
prevailed
on
wall
street
the
dow
has
lost
percent
this
month
as
treasury
yields
soared
to
their
highest
level
since
higher
yields
make
equities
less
attractive
chinese
stocks
closed
lower
on
tuesday
after
data
showed
inflation
had
cooled
for
a
third
straight
month
in
september
amid
weaker
domestic
demand
reflecting
more
pressure
on
the
world
s
economy
looking
forward
a
couple
of
key
points
that
may
drive
where
markets
go
is
the
direction
of
treasury
yields
and
earnings
season
said
investec
economist
ryan
djajasaputra
meanwhile
german
investor
morale
darkened
more
than
expected
in
october
a
survey
showed
on
tuesday
as
concerns
about
an
escalating
trade
dispute
and
britain
crashing
out
of
the
eu
without
a
divorce
deal
clouded
the
outlook
for
europe
s
largest
economy
italian
government
bond
yields
fell
as
much
as
basis
points
across
the
curve
narrowing
the
spread
over
german
peers
after
italian
economy
minister
giovanni
tria
defended
the
country
s
budget
the
most
important
reason
for
the
drop
in
yields
is
that
tria
is
continuing
to
stick
to
the
government
and
defending
the
budget
said
dz
bank
strategist
christian
lenk
this
is
taken
positively
by
the
in
currency
markets
the
dollar
gained
percent
to
yen
after
slipping
to
a
low
of
overnight
switzerland
s
currency
weakened
to

after
advancing
percent
the
previous

the
euro
was
steady
at
while
sterling
gained
percent
against
the
dollar
and
the
euro
after
british
labour
data
beat
expectations
there
was
some
focus
was
on
the
treasury
s
semiannual
currency
report
due
this
week
with
investors
waiting
to
see
washington

not

oil

fell
on
