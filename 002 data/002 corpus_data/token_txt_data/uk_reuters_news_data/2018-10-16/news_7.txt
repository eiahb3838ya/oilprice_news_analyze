graphic-rising oil turns up heat on vulnerable emerging economies
london

a
rise
in
oil
prices
to
highs
is
heaping
pressure
on
big
crude
consumers
such
as
turkey
india
indonesia
and
south
africa
that
are
already
grappling
with
current
account
deficits
weak
currencies
and
rising
inflation
emerging
markets
worldwide
have
been
buffeted
in
recent
months
by
the
strong
dollar
climbing
interest
rates
and
slowing
growth
momentum
with
turkey
and
argentina
descending
into
currency
crises
meanwhile
brent
crude
prices
have
risen
above
per
barrel
thanks
largely
to
coordinated
production
cuts
by
some
of
the
world
s
biggest
oil
exporters
as
well
as
impending
sanctions
on
crude
exporter
iran
that
could
wipe
yet
more
supply
off
the
market
some
analysts
now
think
benchmark
prices
could
return
to
per
barrel
for
the
first
time
since
but
for
a
number
of
importers
such
as
india
turkey
or
indonesia
who
all
have
seen
their
currencies
tumble
to
record
lows
this
year
oil
is
already
more
expensive
now
at
a
barrel
than
it
was
back
in
when
the
price
hit

said

high
oil
prices
are
bad
for
them
unless
it
is
tied
to
growth
being
really
good
today
what
is
driving
oil
prices
higher
is
not
a
in
growth
it
is
a
slowdown
in
supply
and
that
s
a
bad
trouble
is
especially
on
the
cards
for
those
economies
hit
by
the
of
a
sharp
currency
drop
heavy
reliance
on
energy
imports
and

while
china
india
thailand
turkey
south
africa
and
indonesia
top
the
list
of
biggest
emerging
market
oil
importers
thailand
enjoys
a
solid
current
account
surplus
and
china
only
edged
into
a
rare
deficit
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
however
turkey
argentina
india
and
indonesia
find
themselves
high
up
on
the
list
of
countries
featuring
large
current
account
deficits
as
a
percentage
of
their
gdp
according
to
forecasts
by
the
international
monetary
fund
for
for
many
countries
the
pressure
is
rising
crude
imports
with
rising
prices
china
india
indonesia
thailand
turkey
and
south
africa
imported
percent
more
crude
oil
in
july
the
last
month
for
which
complete
data
is
available
than
they
did
in
january
the
average
cost
of
their
oil
imports
in
their
respective
currencies
however
has
risen
by
an
average
of
nearly
percent
in
that
time
analysts
are
also
closely
watching
how
another
oil
shock
might
affect
country
s
import
cover
and
the
adequacy
of
central
banks
foreign
currency
reserves
as
oil
prices
rise
that
ratio
will
come
under
even
more
scrutiny
consumer
spending
power
across
many
of
these
countries
is
also
bound
to
suffer
as
unlike
in
many
consumers
do
not
have
the
same
cushion
of
fuel
subsidies
and
central
banks
have
to
ramp
up
rates
to
tackle
inflation
pressures
and
steady
their
currencies

meanwhile
the
hit
taken
by
emerging
market
economies
is
likely
to
be
severe
enough
to
slow
down
oil
demand
growth
this
year
and
next
all
three
major
oil
market
forecasters
the
international
energy
agency
the

information
administration
and
opec
cut
their
estimates
for

demand
growth
this
year
and
next
in

the
financial
pain
