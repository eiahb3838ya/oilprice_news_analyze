northern
british
columbia
royal
dutch
shell
plc
is
using
new
technologies
and
processes
to
cut
emissions
to
address
public
and
environmental
group
concerns
that
canada
s
nascent
liquefied
natural
gas
export
industry
could
be
a
climate
time
bomb
the
groundbirch
project
perched
above
canada
s
richest
shale
gas
deposit
some
kilometers
miles
northeast
of
vancouver
includes
four
gas
plants
and
wells
dotted
over
an
area
the
size
of
new
york
city
shell
has
already
slashed
project
emissions
by
moving
its
newest
gas
plant
to
power
and
replacing
diesel
with
natural
gas
in
drilling
and
is
now
tackling
methane
with
new
electric
components
and
a
fuel
cell
trial
there
is
a
considerable
body
of
research
showing
natural
gas
is
far
cleaner
than
coal
but
only
so
long
as
methane
emissions
are
contained
methane
is
many
times
more
potent
than
carbon
dioxide
though
the
industry
produces
far
less
of
it
groundbirch
will
eventually
send
gas
hundreds
of
miles
west
to
the
lng
canada
export
terminal
approved
this
month
where
it
will
be
cooled
for
exporting
lng
canada
is
being
touted
as
the
world
s
cleanest
major
lng
plant
lng
demand
is
booming
as
countries
like
china
swap
out
coal
plants
for
gas
in
the
battle
against
choking
pollution
but
environmental
groups
say
exports
will
boost
carbon
emissions
in
canada
both
through
gas
extraction
and
the
liquefaction
process
they
warn
that
this
could
derail
british
columbia
s
pledge
to
cut
greenhouse
gases
by
percent
by
and
test
canada
s
vow
to
cut
emissions
nationwide
by
percent
from
levels
by
there
s
no
way
to
produce
energy
using
gas
without
emissions
said
jens
wieting
a
campaigner
with
sierra
club
bc
considering
methane
leakage
it
s
very
difficult
to
make
any
statement
that
gas
is
any
better
than
methane
the
main
component
in
natural
gas
is
released
into
the
atmosphere
mostly
from
the
venting
of
unburned
gas
and
through
leaks
in
gas
infrastructure
like
wells
or
pipelines
estimates
of
the
carbon
impact
of
lng
canada
from
wellhead
to
port
vary
the
british
columbia
government
pegs
it
at
million
tonnes
mt
per
year
while
environmental
groups
say
it
could
be
as
high
as
mt
the
province
expects
to
cut
emissions
to
about
mt
by
and
mt
by
from
mt
in
gas
from
several
canadian
producers
will
eventually
feed
lng
canada
with
roughly
percent
coming
from
shell
s
groundbirch
project
shell
last
month
announced
a
plan
to
limit
methane
emissions
at
its
assets
around
the
world
and
is
implementing
a
global
methane
monitoring
program
last
year
it
set
a
goal
of
halving
its
global
carbon
emissions
by
in
canada
groundbirch
s
methane
intensity
a
measure
of
methane
emitted
compared
to
total
volume
of
product
produced
is
percent
already
half
the
new
percent
by
target
set
by
the
company
at
one
of
groundbirch
s
newest
well
pads
two
hulking
trailers
hold
thermal
electric
generators
that
power
the
batteries
that
run
the
pad
s
equipment
they
are
efficient
but
they
do
produce
combustion
emissions
so
what
we
re
looking
at
is
finding
new
technology
to
replace
that
said
chang
liu
a
facilities
at
groundbirch
the
company
is
testing
whether
methanol
fuel
cells
which
have
no
carbon
emissions
could
be
used
in
the
next
generation
of
well
pads
eliminating
vented
methane
for
now
the
latest
generation
of
well
pads
use
electric
valve
actuators
cutting
methane
emissions
such
actions
are
a
fantastic
first
step
said
duncan
kenyon
of
the
pembina
institute
an
energy
policy
but
he
said
not
all
canadian
producers
are
following
through
on
pledges
to
reduce
emissions
what
we
need
is
regulations
that
lock
some
of
these
volunteer
commitments
in
place
