a
boost
from
expectations
that

will
deliver

if
you
look
at
what
s
happening
here
and
now
it
is
an
improvement
from
what
was
happening
a
week
ago
alexandrovich
said
how
long
the
stability
lasts
is
anyone

calmer
equity

took
the
shine
off

down
a
third
of
a

against
the

the
swiss
franc
edged
away
from
almost
highs
against
the
greenback
and
gold
dropped
from
monday
s
high
as
tension
between
the
west
and
saudi
arabia
triggered
a
fresh
exit
out
of
risk
assets
the
disappearance
in
turkey
earlier
this
month
of
a
saudi
journalist
critical
of
riyadh
has
provoked
an
international
outcry
against
the
kingdom
saudi

is
preparing

acknowledge
the
death
of
saudi

jamal
khashoggi
in

on

that
backdrop
together
with
nagging
concerns
about
the
economic
outlook
global
trade
tensions
and
higher

rates
meant
a
degree
of
caution
prevailed
the

closed
lower
on
tuesday
after

showed
inflation
had
cooled
for
a
third
straight
month
in
september
amid
weaker
domestic
demand
reflecting
more
pressure
on
the
world
s
economy
the
focus
of
the
markets
has
turned
to
the
middle
east
due
to
the
saudi
incident
and
with
stocks
still
struggling
other
equity
markets
will
have
a
difficult
time
bouncing
convincingly

after

tria
defended
the

the
most
important
reason
for
the
drop
in

is
that

is
continuing
to
stick
to
the

defending
the
