german
power
and
gas
network
companies
tennet
thyssengas
and
gasunie
deutschland
said
they
plan
to
build
a
megawatt
mw
plant
to
turn
renewable
energy
into
gas
for
industrial
use
in
the
ruhr
region
the
plant
in
lower
saxony
would
be
the
biggest
plant
ptg
in
germany
and
would
be
connected
to
the
grid
in
phases
from
the
companies
said
in
a
statement
on
tuesday
they
did
not
give
the
estimated
investment
as
germany
has
set
a
target
to
nearly
double
the
share
of
wind
and
solar
power
to
percent
of
electricity
generation
by
grid
operators
are
looking
to
develop
ptg
plants
and
other
technologies
ptg
entails
running
wind
or
solar
power
through
water
to
split
it
into
oxygen
and
hydrogen
which
can
then
be
used
as
a
transport
fuel
or
fed
into
electricity
grids
the
partners
aim
to
create
comprehensive
links
between
the
energy
transport
and
industrial
sectors
the
three
companies
said
the
green
power
that
is
turned
into
gas
will
be
transported
to
the
industrial
ruhr
region
but
also
supply
hydrogen
filling
stations
for
mobility
and
can
be
stored
in
underground
caverns
for
industrial
usage

oge
said
in
the
summer
that
they
were
also
looking
to
build
ptg
plants
with
capacities
of
to
mw
utility
uniper
has
already
embarked
on
a
small
scale
on
the
next
step
in
ptg
technology
this
involves
turning
hydrogen
into
methane
gas
that
is
identical
in
its
qualities
to
natural
gas
mined
from
fossil
fuel
deposits
