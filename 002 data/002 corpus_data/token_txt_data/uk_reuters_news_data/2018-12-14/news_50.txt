asian
shares
were
on
the
defensive
on
friday
as
investors
kept
a
wary
eye
on
economic
tensions
between
washington
and
beijing
while
the
euro
was
steady
after
the
european
central
bank
halted
new
bond

while
the

if

that
would
be
a
very
weak
technical
sign
said
nobuhiko
kuramochi
chief
strategist
at
mizuho
securities
corporate
earnings
due
next
month
could
throw
a
spotlight
on
the
impact
from
the
tariffs
on
imports
from
china
while
there
is
risk
of
a
government
shutdown
and
further
political
stalemate
in
a
divided
congress
he
said
although
hopes
of
progress
in
talks
and
cheap
valuations
are
supporting
the
market
for
now
we
have
lots
of
potential
pitfalls
kuramochi
added
a
chinese
commerce
ministry
spokesman
said
on
thursday
china
and
the
united
states
are
in
close
contact
over
trade
and
that
any
trade
delegation
would
be
welcome
to
visit
but
that
has
hardly
dispelled
concerns
about
a
broadening
confrontation
between
the
two
economic
heavyweights
china
said
on
thursday
a
canadian
businessman
is
being
investigated
on
suspicion
of
harming
china
s
security
days
after
a
former
canadian
diplomat
was
detained
in
an
escalating
diplomatic
row
the
moves
are
seen
as
a
reaction
to
canada
s
arrest
on
of
chinese
executive
meng
wanzhou
the
chief
financial
officer
of
huawei
technologies
for
extradition
to
the

the
euro
changed
hands
at
stuck
in
its
range
over
the
past
few
days
the
ecb
ended
its
trillion
euro
bond
purchase
scheme
but
pledged
to
continue
reinvesting
maturing
bonds
thereby
avoiding
shrinking
its
balance
sheet
for
an
extended
period
of
time
the

sharply
on
thursday
sterling
s
rally
fizzled
as
signs
that
the
british
parliament
was
headed
towards
a
deadlock
over
brexit
prompted
traders
to
take
profits
from
its
gains
made
after
prime
minister
theresa
may
had
survived
a
vote
may
admitted
on
thursday
she
did
not
expect
a
quick
breakthrough
in
brexit
talks
that
would
help
get
the
deal
through
parliament
the
european
union
has
said
the
agreed
brexit
deal
is
not
open
for
renegotiation
even
though
its
leaders
on
thursday
gave
may
assurances
that
they
would
seek
to
agree
a
new
pact
with
britain
by
so
that
the
contentious
irish
backstop
is
never

its
fourth
consecutive

this
week
the
dollar
stood
at
yen
flat
on
the
day
but
having
risen
from
this
week

low

on
monday
oil
prices
held
firm
after
data
showed
on
thursday
inventory
declines
in
the
united
states
and
as
investors
began
to
expect
that
the
global
oil
market
could
have
a
deficit
sooner
than
they
had
previously
thought
the
international
energy
agency
said
in
its
monthly
report
that
opec
s
output
agreement
with
russia
and
canada
s
decision
to
mandate
production
cuts
could
create
an
