rebounded
in

three
straight

defying
a
fall
in
prices
for
the
metal
used
in
everything
from
construction
to
making
cars
analysts
were
surprised
by
the
climb
which
came
as
smelters
apparently
ramped
up
output
ahead
of
winter
production
curbs
that

fell
by
percent
over
november
and
hit
lows
leaving
smelters
struggling
to
turn
a

market
new

increases
probably
outpaced
the
capacity
closures
said
helen
lau
an
analyst
at

securities
in

kong
lower
prices
for
raw
materials
bauxite
and
alumina
may
also
have
been
a
factor
she
added
the
cost
pressure
is
lower
and
that
also
helps
smelters
to
increase
