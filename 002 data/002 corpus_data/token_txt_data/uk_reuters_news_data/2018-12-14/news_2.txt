talks
in

city
of
katowice
point
to
the
mining
museum
next
to
the
conference
venue
as
the
proper
place
for
coal
which
provides
percent
of
the
country
s
electricity
poland
s
decision
to
host
the
negotiations
to
revive
the
paris
agreement
on
phasing
out
fossil
fuel
has
laid
bare
the
tension
between
goals
and
business
realities

coal
bosses
see
a
need
to
address
climate
risk
but
say
poland
must
use
thermal
coal
for
electricity
until
it
has
a
better
option
silesia
also
produces
coking
coal
used
in
steel
and
viewed
as
a
strategic
mineral
even
by
the
european
union
which
seeks
to
be
an
environmental
leader
poland
s
jsw
the
european
union
s
largest
coking
coal
producer
is
seeking
to
grow
the
world
has
to
tackle
the
increase
of
carbon
dioxide
emissions
but
i
do
not
see
a
chance
the
world
can
live
without
steel
these
days
and
there
is
not
an
easy
solution
to
substitute
steel
and
substitute
coking
coal
ceo
daniel
ozon
told
reuters
financial
backing
can
be
an
issue
for
all
forms
of
coal
and
jsw
has
its
eye
on
chinese
banks
as
international
lenders
are
wary
for
many
poles
coal
mining
symbolizes
national
independence
companies
can
look
to
a
government
striving
to
win
over
an
electorate
divided
between
an
older
generation
that
associates
coal
with
a
reliable
income
and
a
sense
of
community
and
youths

coal
bhp
was
among
business
representatives
taking
part
in
the
side
events
accompanying
the
negotiations
the
talks
have
proved
long
and
fractious
with
including
a
revolt
by
saudi
arabia
russia
the
united
states
and
kuwait
against
a
major
scientific
report
that
laid
out
the
reasons
to
limit
global
warming
to
degrees
celsius
the
real
challenge
is
not
whether
it
s
degrees
or
degrees
it
s
that
not
enough
is
happening
graham
winkelman
bhp
s
practice
lead
on
climate
change
said
in
an
interview
bhp
stands
apart
from
other
big
miners
with
a
goal
to
make
its
own
operations
carbon
neutral
in
line
with
the
paris
agreement
by
the
second
half
of
the
century
but
just
as
governments
have
to
work
out
practicalities
it
is
also
unclear
how
bhp
can
achieve
its
goals
there
is
no
definitive
winkelman
said
although
he
repeated
a
frequent
industry
request
for
a
carbon
price
to
help
shift
investment
towards
a
greener
technology
poland
s
aim
is
to
share
the
challenges
of
bringing
about
a
just
transition
polish
deputy
environment
minister
michal
kurtyka
who
presided
over
the
talks
said
as
a
graduate
of
paris
elite
ecole
polytechnique
a
physicist
an
economist
and
an
engineer
his
favored
solution
is
electric
vehicles
with
fewer
moving
parts
and
less
wasted
heat
than
internal
combustion
engines
he
says
they
will
help
even
if
they
run
on
power
as
a
citizen
of
a
country
that
switched
in
from
a
centrally
planned
to
a
market
economy
kurtyka
has
experience
of
deep
change
in
my
young
days
growing
up
in
krakow
that
was
a
completely
different
city
from
now
at
the
lights
switched
off
you
could
not
open
the
window
because
of
air
pollution
he
said
in
katowice
some
residents
say
they
still
can
t
let
the
air
in
and
are
not
confident
that
is
about
to
change
