after
weak
economic
data
from

global
growth
worries
as
investors
weighed
the
broader
impact
of
the
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
euro
zone
business
ended
the
year
on
a
weak
note
expanding
at
the
slowest
pace
in
over
four
years
as

meanwhile
suggesting

works
to
defuse
its
trade

with
the
united
states
certainly
people
are
now
starting
to
look
through

end
of
cycle
and
say
what
could
end
of
cycle
look
like

in

while
we
do
expect
equities
to
provide
a
reasonable
return
next
year
as
you
get
later
in
the
cycle
the
posture
is
probably
to
fade

the
dow

now
down
more
than
percent
from
its

each

the
three
major
indexes
in

territory
the
growth
worries
overshadowed
the
latest
signs
of
a
thaw
in
the
trade
battle
as
beijing
said
it
will
temporarily
suspend
additional
