under

to
curb

its
government
said
at
climate
talks
in
poland
this
week
four
ukrainian
cities
also
reaffirmed
their
goal
of
shifting
to
percent

this

svitlana

central

director
for
climate
campaign
said
ukrainian
citizens
and
mayors
were
showing
that
a
rapid
and
fair
transition
to
clean
energy
was
both
possible
and
popular
the
new
national
target
should
reflect
and
build
on
these
cities

she
added
ukraine
has
pledged
to
cut
its
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
at
least
percent
from
levels
by
under
the
paris
accord
by
its
emissions
had
already
fallen
percent
due
to
an
economic
collapse
following
the
of
the
soviet
union
ilya
eremenko
head
of
the
ukrainian
climate
network
said
many
cities
had
set
their
own
goals
for
reducing
emissions
which
are
far
more
ambitious
than
national
ones
a
combination
of
national
and
local
targets
is
crucial
for
effective
climate
policy
he
added
in
june
the
northwest
ukrainian
city
of
zhytomyr
became
the
first
city
in
the
wider
region
to
adopt
a
target
of
using
percent
renewable
energy
by
according
to
its
mayor
three
other
ukrainian
cities
chortkiv
and
lviv
have
since
signed
up
to
the
same
ambition
in
ukraine
energy
is
a
crucial
issue
in
both
international
and
domestic
politics
zhytomyr
mayor
serhiy
sukhomlyn
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
at
september
s
global
climate
action
summit
in
san
francisco
moving
to
local
clean
energy
production
would
end
dependence
on
imported
fossil
fuels
including
natural
gas
which
can
be
exploited
for
political
ends
he
said
hundred
percent
renewable
also
means
percent
energy
independence
sukhomlyn
said
major
rows
have
flared
up
several
times
with
russia
over
issues
such
as
whether
ukraine
siphoned
off
gas
supplies
for
europe
as
they
were
transported
through
russia
s
neighbouring
state
as
well
as
payments
relating
to
gas
supply
and
transit
since
russia
annexed
the
ukrainian
region
of
crimea
in
ukraine
imports
gas
mainly
from
other
european
countries
though
some
of
that
originates
from
russia
and
it
is
aiming
to
produce
more
from
its
own
fields
including
shale
gas
in
future
to
help
end
zhytomyr
s
dependency
on
gas
and
other
fossil
fuels
it
plans
to
build
a
mw
solar
power
plant
by
and
add
another
mw
of
solar
capacity
later
today
renewable
sources
account
for
less
than
percent
of
energy
used
by
the
city
known
as
the
birthplace
of
soviet
rocket
engineer
sergei
korolev
who
played
a
lead
role
in
launching
the
first
human
into
space
zhytomyr
is
also
planning
four
plants
and
three
biofuel
plants
replacing
close
to
half
the
gas
used
by
the
city
in
the
next
few
years
sukhomlyn
said
the
projects
had
been
made
possible
by
reforms
to
decentralise
energy
production
in
ukraine
local
authorities
and
municipalities
are
getting
a
lot
of
independence
enabling
them
to
develop
partnerships
with
investors
and
international
financial
institutions
he
said
the
energy
transition
in
the
city
of
just
over
people
is
supported
by
donors
including
germany
switzerland
and
slovenia
as
well
as
multilateral
financial
institutions
sukhomlyn
said
the
city
plans
to
reduce
energy
consumption
by
at
least
percent
by
and
curb
related
emissions
to
help
achieve
that
it
will
retrofit
schools
and
other
municipal
buildings
put
in
new
electric
trolley
buses
and
use
led
bulbs
for
street
lighting
the
district
heating
system
will
be
modernised
with
boilers
that
run
on
biofuels
including
wood
chips
and
farm
waste
the
city
has
also
launched
a
programme
to
fund
insulation
for
housing
associations
the
overall
transformation
aims
to
bring
down
energy
prices
for
households
by
percent
the
city
council
said
producing
energy
locally
will
be
cheaper
than
importing
gas
and
efficiency
measures
will
lower
usage
it
added
the
economic
rationale
for
going
in
energy
is
key
to
getting
citizens
onboard
said
the
mayor
fossil
fuel
prices
have
recently
been
increasing
and
switching
to
local
energy
sources
will
provide
stable
and
cheaper
alternatives
sukhomlyn
said
in
zhytomyr
joined
the
global
covenant
of
mayors
for
climate
and
energy
an
international
coalition
and
committed
to
reduce
its
carbon
emissions
by
at
least
percent
by
two
years
later
a
working
group
uniting
city
government
experts
municipal
energy
companies
scientists
and
the
public
drafted
a
sustainable
energy
policy
climate
action
group
will
help
city
authorities
develop
further
plans
for
the
transition
to
renewable
energy
and
craft
a
climate
strategy
in
together
with
inhabitants
public
demand
for
clean
energy
is
also
an
opportunity
for
city
residents
to
have
an
influence
over
the
decision
makers
on
local
climate
and
energy
solutions
said
romanko
activists
meanwhile
have
launched
an
app
called
climate
drops
that
rewards
green
behaviour
such
as
recycling
and
when
residents
bring
plastic
bottles
to
the
recycling
centre
for
example
they
receive
points
or
drops
via
the
app
which
can
be
traded
for
discounts
in
restaurants
and
stores
the
app
has
spread
to
another
cities
across
the
country
and
has
about
active
users
excluding
large
hydropower
dams
renewable
energy
accounts
for
less
than
percent
of
ukraine
s
electricity
production
said
komila
nabiyeva
of
energy
watch
group
a
network
of
scientists
and
parliamentarians
the
government
has
set
a
target
to
generate
percent
from
renewable
sources
but
that
includes
hydropower
which
already
accounts
for
percent
making
the
goal
unambitious
said
nabiyeva
this
year
ukraine
also
published
a
development
strategy
through
to
aimed
at
helping
work
out
how
to
boost
renewable
energy
and
implement
energy
efficiency
measures
while
modernising
its
electricity
grid
and
transport
infrastructure
nabiyeva
said
a
recent
study
by
energy
watch
group
and
finland
s
lut
university
showed
ukraine
s
electricity
could
be
supplied
entirely
from
local
renewable
energy
sources
excluding
large
hydro
dams
by
which
would
be
more
than
today
s
system
based
mainly
on
coal
and
nuclear
the
government
s
current
energy
strategy
which
runs
until
prioritises
growth
in
hydropower
while
it
is
aimed
at
reducing
production
the
plan
could
be
thwarted
by
strong
