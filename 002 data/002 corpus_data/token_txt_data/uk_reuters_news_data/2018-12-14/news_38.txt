singapore
reuters
around
millions
worth
of
oil
was
stolen
from
shell
s
biggest
global
refinery
over
several
years
singapore
court
documents
reviewed
by
reuters
show
far
more
than
reported
when
police
first
revealed
the
heist
earlier
this
year
almost
a
year
on
from
raids
that
led
to
over
a
dozen
arrests
including
of
several
former
employees
of
the
local
unit
of
royal
dutch
shell
charge
sheets
state
that
around
tonnes
of
gasoil
were
stolen
from
the
oil
major
s
pulau
bukom
site
in
singapore
in
incidents
dating
back
to
charges
filed
in
the
first
few
months
of
investigations
after
police
raids
in
january
related
to
the
theft
of
around
million
in
oil
further
charges
levied
in
may
showed
a
total
of
million
had
been
stolen
a
spokeswoman
for
shell
said
the
firm
is
disappointed
adding
that
it
has
been
working
with
investigators
and
taken
measures
to
avoid
repeat
incidents
at
the
pulau
bukom
facility
which
lies
just
south
of
singapore
s
main
island
these
include
closer
monitoring
of
products
moving
in
and
out
of
bukom
tightening
vessel
management
procedures
and
stepping
up
ethics
and
compliance
training
the
spokeswoman
said
in
an
emailed
statement
to
reuters
on
thursday
southeast
asia
is
a
hot
spot
for
illegal
fuel
trading
with
its
waters
providing
cover
for
smuggling
of
oil
products
across
borders
but
the
regularity
and
audacity
of
the
thefts
at
shell
s
refining
facility
some
of
which
took
place
during
working
hours
stand
out
fuel
is
both
ubiquitous
and
untraceable
making
its
theft
a
seemingly
criminal
operation
compared
to
something
like
drug
smuggling
or
arms
trafficking
where
the
concern
about
being
caught
is
much
higher
said
ian
ralby
a
maritime
crime
expert
who
works
with
both
the
and
the
think
tank
atlantic
council
that
false
sense
of
security
leads
to
some
fairly
brazen
forms
of
fuel
theft
could
be
worth
billion
a
year
globally
according
to
industry
estimates
although
ralby
said
that
figure
might
be
conservative
the
case
in
singapore
looks
like
it
could
drag
on
given
the
routine
addition
of
new
charges
and
amendments
to
older
charges
the
police
investigation
is
still
ongoing
we
are
at
the
stage
that
the
charges
are
still
being
rearranged
it
s
quite
far
from
final
sentencing
