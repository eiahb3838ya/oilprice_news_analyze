reuters
farm
automaker
and
food
and
beverage
groups
pressed
the
trump
administration
on
friday
to
ensure
that
any
new
trade
talks
with
the
european
union
lead
to
an
increase
in
their
access
to
eu
markets
with
less
red
tape
president
donald
trump
has
demanded
better
terms
of
trade
for
the
united
states
from
china
the
eu
and
japan
washington
has
already
reworked
the
north
american
trade
treaty
with
neighbours
mexico
and
canada
trump
said
poor
trade
deals
have
cost
the
united
states
millions
of
jobs
at
a
hearing
on
negotiating
objectives
for
trade
talks
with
the
european
union
groups
representing
farmers
food
and
automobile
companies
said
they
wanted
to
be
included
in
the
talks
and
that
reducing
tariffs
and
regulatory
restrictions
should
be
a
key
objective
the
trade
representative
notified
lawmakers
in
october
of
its
plans
to
pursue
the
trade
talks
though
it
has
been
unclear
whether
agriculture
and
automobiles
would
be
included
as
a
joint
statement
from
the
regions
in
july
called
for
reductions
but
gave
little
direction
on
either
sector
it
is
fundamental
that
food
and
agriculture
issues
are
a
key
component
of
this
agreement
grains
council
director
of
trade
policy
floyd
gaibler
said
at
the
hearing
that
sentiment
was
echoed
by
others
throughout
the
farm
and
food
sector
as
well
as
automaker
groups
testimony
from
the
hearing
will
feed
into
the
ustr
s
formulation
of
negotiating
objectives
for
the
talks
it
is
unclear
exactly
when
those
discussions
will
begin
the
farm
and
food
groups
on
friday
also
urged
officials
to
address
tariff
barriers
and
other
regulatory
and
labelling
issues
that
hinder
access
to
the
lucrative
european
market
the
european
union
has
more
stringent
standards
than
the
united
states
regarding
the
use
of
pesticides
hormones
and
biotechnology
in
food
crops
producers
of
products
from
beef
to
pistachios
say
these
limit
their
access
to
the
european
market
these
are
issues
that
we
have
struggled
with
for
a
long
period
of
time
said
gaibler
referring
to
the
restrictions
on
biotechnology
he
also
stressed
the
importance
of
trying
to
remove
antidumping
duties
that
the
european
union
has
placed
on
ethanol
grocery
manufacturers
association
federal
affairs
director
nancy
wilkins
reiterated
that
biotechnology
is
key
issue
saying
the
eu
s
labelling
requirements
for
genetically
modified
organisms
known
as
gmos
dramatically
increase
costs
for
food
companies
for
automakers
the
deal
is
an
opportunity
to
make
regulations
in
both
regions
more
consistent
differing
safety
standards
can
add
millions
of
dollars
in
cost
per
vehicle
making
it
difficult
to
sell
american
vehicles
into
europe
the
american
automotive
policy
council
said
food
and
automaker
groups
pressed
officials
to
remove
existing
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
at
least
while
the
negotiations
are
taking
place
under
trump
the
united
states
has
placed
section
national
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
prompting
other
countries
to
slap
hefty
retaliatory
levies
on
goods
jennifer
thomas
vice
president
of
federal
government
affairs
at
the
alliance
of
automobile
manufacturers
said
the
steep
and
unexpected
increases
have
driven
up
costs
at
a
difficult
time
we
are
very
much
at
a
time
where
my
companies
are
witnessing
flat
or
decreased
sales
she
said
this
ongoing
threat
of
auto
tariffs
via
is
just
injecting
more
uncertainty
at
an
already
fragile
