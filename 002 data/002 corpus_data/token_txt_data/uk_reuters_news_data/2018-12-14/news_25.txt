libya
s
national
oil
noc
said
it
was
against
paying
a
ransom
to
an
armed
group
that
has
halted
crude
production
at
the
country
s
largest
oilfield
any
attempt
to
pay
a
ransom
to
the
armed
militia
which
shut
down
el
sharara
oilfield
would
set
a
dangerous
precedent
that
would
threaten
the
recovery
of
the
libyan
economy
noc
chairman
mustafa
sanalla
said
in
a
statement
on
the
company
s
website
noc
on
monday
declared
force
majeure
on
exports
from
the
oilfield
after
it
was
seized
at
the
weekend
by
a
local
militia
group
the
nearby
oilfield
which
uses
the
same
power
supply
as
el
sharara
was
still
producing
normally
a
spokesman
for
noc
said
without
giving
an
output
figure
the
field
usually
pumps
around
bpd
since
libya
has
faced
a
wave
of
blockages
of
oilfields
and
export
terminals
by
armed
groups
and
civilians
trying
to
press
the
country
s
weak
state
into
concessions
officials
have
tended
to
end
such
action
by
paying
off
protesters
who
demand
to
be
added
to
the
public
payroll
at
el
sharara
in
southern
libya
a
mix
of
guards
civilians
and
tribesmen
have
occupied
the
field
camping
there
since
saturday
protesters
and
oil
workers
said
the
protesters
work
in
shifts
with
some
going
home
at
night
noc
has
evacuated
some
staff
by
plane
engineers
at
the
oilfield
said
a
number
of
away
from
the
main
field
have
been
vacated
and
equipment
removed
the
occupiers
are
divided
with
members
of
the
petroleum
facilities
guard
pfg
indicating
they
would
end
the
blockade
in
return
for
a
quick
cash
payment
oil
workers
say
the
pfg
has
demanded
more
men
be
added
to
the
public
payroll
the
tribesmen
have
asked
for
development
funds
which
might
take
time
libya
is
run
by
two
competing
weak
governments
armed
groups
tribesmen
and
normal
libyans
tend
to
vent
their
anger
about
high
inflation
and
a
lack
of
infrastructure
on
the
noc
which
they
see
as
a
cash
cow
booking
billions
of
dollars
in
oil
and
gas
revenues
