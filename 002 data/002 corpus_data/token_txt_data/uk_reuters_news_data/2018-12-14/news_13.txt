rising
risks
to

as
beijing
works

a

with

a
chinese
statistics
bureau
spokesman
said
the
november
data
showed
downward
pressure
on
the
economy
is
increasing
the
data
means
that
the
worst
is
yet
to
come
and
policymakers
will
be
very
worried
particularly
with

growth
falling
off

said
sue
trinh
head
of
asia
fx
strategy
at
rbc
capital
markets
in
hong
kong
so
i
expect
further
support
measures
including
rate
cuts
will
come
in
coming
weeks
although
these
data
would
indicate
measures
to

aren
t
really
the
chinese
yuan
weakened

in

following
the
data
although
hopes
of
progress
in
talks
and
cheap
valuations
are
supporting
the
market
for
now
we
have
lots
of
potential
pitfalls
said
nobuhiko
kuramochi
chief
strategist
at
mizuho
securities
if

fall
below
their
triple

hit
recently
that
would
be
a
very
weak

corporate
earnings
due
next

could
throw
a
spotlight
on
the
impact
from
the
tariffs
on
imports
from
china
while
there
is
risk
of
a
government
shutdown
and
further
political
stalemate
in
a
divided
congress
kuramochi
added
in
the
currency
market
the
euro
stuck
in
its
range
over
the
past
few
days
a
day
after
the
european
central
bank
ended
its
trillion
euro
bond
purchase
scheme
but
pledged
to
continue
reinvesting
maturing
bonds
avoiding
shrinking
its
balance
for
an
extended
period
of
time
the
common
currency
last
changed
hands
at
with
thursday
s
decision
the
ecb
is
only
taking
very
lightly
the
foot
off
the
accelerator
of
monetary
policy
which
is
by
no
means
a
real
normalisation
of
monetary
policy

s
rally
fizzled
as
signs
that
the
british
parliament
was
headed
towards
a
deadlock
over
brexit
prompted
traders
to
take
profits
from
its
gains
made
after
prime
minister
theresa
may
had
survived
a
vote
the
european
union
has
said
the
agreed
brexit
deal
is
not
open
for
renegotiation
even
though
its
leaders
on
thursday
gave
may
assurances
that
they
would
seek
to
agree
a
new
pact
with
britain
by
so
that
the
contentious
irish
backstop
is
never
triggered
the
pound
fell
percent
to
on
track
to
post
its
fifth
consecutive
week
of

it
was
down
percent
so
far
this
week
the

stood
at
yen
flat
on
the
day
but
above
this
week
s
low
of
set
on
monday
the
kiwi
fell
as
much
as
percent
to
after
the
central
bank
said
it
was
considering
almost
doubling
the
required
capital
banks
would
need
to
hold
to
bolster
the
financial
system
s
capacity
to
handle
any
shocks
oil
prices
gave
up
some
of
their
thursday
s
gains
following
inventory
declines
in
the
united
states
and
expectations
that
the
global
oil
market
could
have
a
deficit
sooner
than
they
had
previously
thought
crude
futures
edged
down
percent
to
per
barrel
and
brent
crude
slipped
percent
to
after
both
gained
more

emailed
on

to
hundreds
of
