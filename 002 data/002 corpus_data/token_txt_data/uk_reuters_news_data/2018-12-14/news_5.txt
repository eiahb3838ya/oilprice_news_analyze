ministers
are
working
around
the
clock
to
complete
and
strengthen
the
rules
for
making
a
landmark
agreement
to
combat
climate
change
operational
with
one
day
of
talks
remaining
delegates
from
nearly
nations
are
on
a
deadline
to
produce
a
rule
book
to
flesh
out
details
of
paris
agreement
which
aims
to
limit
the
global
temperature
rise
to
below
degrees
celsius
and
which
comes
into
force
in
talks
in
katowice
poland
under
way
since
have
been
clouded
by
political
divisions
and
progress
had
been
slow
until
some
deadlocks
were
broken
and
draft
texts
produced
overnight
the
drafts
show
that
there
has
been
compromise
in
some
areas
such
as
language
to
recognise
the
importance
of
a
report
on
limiting
global
warming
to
which
caused
rifts
last
week
and
on
finance
we
are
entering
the
final
lap
there
are
still
people
unhappy
but
basically
it
looks
good
i
think
we
will
make
it
in
the
end
but
not
everyone
is
satisfied
yet
said
german
environment
minister
svenja
schulze
it
will
be
a
long
night
in
the
sprawling
spodek
conference
venue
a
flying
concert
and
sports
hall
as
teams
continue
to
haggle
over
the
texts
in
groups
this
is
a
start
but
far
from
finished
business
compromise
texts
are
paid
for
in
human
lives
lost
and
the
poor
and
vulnerable
are
calling
for
so
much
more
said
jennifer
morgan
executive
director
of
greenpeace
international
delegates
said
concerns
remained
about
the
rules
for
implementing
article
of
the
paris
agreement
and
whether
they
can
be
beefed
up
to
avoid
of
emissions
and
weakening
the
integrity
of
environmental
markets
a
big
issue
for
countries
most
vulnerable
to
climate
change
is
a
mechanism
to
find
ways
to
cover
the
growing
costs
of
loss
and
damage
which
has
been
relegated
to
a
footnote
in
the
draft
greater
clarity
is
also
sought
on
what
countries
will
do
after
leaving
poland
and
how
they
will
strengthen
their
commitments
and
targets
under
the
agreement
