ensure

trade
talks
with
the
european
union
boost
their
market
access
and
decrease
regulatory

talks
with
the

groups
representing

restrictions
should
be
a
key
objective
the
trade
representative
notified
lawmakers
in
october
of
its
plans
to
pursue
the
trade
talks
though
it
has
been
unclear
if
agriculture
would
be
included
it
is
fundamental
that
food
and
agriculture
issues
are
a
key
component
of
this
agreement
grains
council
director
of
trade
policy
floyd
gaibler
said
at
the
hearing
testimony
from
the
hearing
will
feed
into
the
ustr
s
formulation
of
negotiating
objectives
for
the
talks
it
is
unclear
exactly
when
those
discussions
will
begin
in
addition
to
the
central
demand
that
the
talks
include
their
goods
farm
and
food
groups
on
friday
urged
officials
to
address
tariff
barriers
and
other
regulatory
and
labeling
issues
that
curtail
access
to
the
lucrative
european
market
the
european
union
has
more
stringent
standards
than
the
united
states
regarding
the
use
of
pesticides
hormones
and
biotechnology
in
food
crops
producers
of
products
from
beef
to
pistachios
say
these
limit
their
access
to
the
european
market
these
are
issues
that
we
have
struggled
with
for
a
long
period
of
time
said
gaibler
referring
to
the
restrictions
on
biotechnology
he
also
stressed
the
importance
of
the
removal
of
antidumping
duties
the
eu
has
placed
on
ethanol
grocery
manufacturers
association
federal
affairs
director
nancy
wilkins
also
pressed
to
make
biotechnology
a
key
issue
saying
the
eu
s
labeling
requirements
for
genetically
modified
organisms
known
as
gmos
dramatically
increase
costs
for
food
companies
wilkins
also
pressed
officials
to
suspend
existing
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminum
while
the
negotiations
are
taking
place
under
republican
president
donald
trump
the
united
states
has
placed
national
security
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminum
prompting
other
countries
to
slap
hefty
retaliatory
levies
on
goods
the
dairy
sector
said
the
united
states
should
push
back
on
europe
s
labeling
requirements
related
to
geographic
designations
for
cheese
europe
prevents
companies
from
using
the
names
like
parmesan
and
asiago
for
their
cheeses
these
geographic
restrictions
give
short
shrift
to
these
common
terms
