update 2-u.n. climate talks go into overtime as negotiators grapple with text
katowice
poland
reuters
ministers
and
negotiators
from
nearly
nations
were
making
a
final
effort
on
friday
evening
to
find
consensus
on
the
language
and
sticking
points
of
a
package
to
implement
a
landmark
agreement
to
combat
climate
change
countries
are
on
a
deadline
to
produce
a
rulebook
to
flesh
out
details
of
the
paris
agreement
which
aims
to
limit
the
global
temperature
rise
to
below
degrees
celsius
and
which
comes
into
force
in
talks
in
katowice
poland
under
way
since
have
been
clouded
by
political
divisions
progress
had
been
slow
until
some
deadlocks
were
broken
and
draft
texts
produced
overnight
before
the
talks
started
many
expected
that
the
deal
would
not
be
robust
and
fall
short
of
the
detailed
plan
scientists
have
said
is
needed
to
limit
global
warming
to
well
below
a
rise
this
century
but
on
friday
evening
there
was
more
optimism
than
in
the
morning
that
compromises
could
be
made
to
make
the
text
acceptable
to
all
parties
exhausted
delegates
were
trying
to
iron
out
differences
in
what
could
be
a
long
night
in
the
sprawling
spodek
conference
venue
a
flying
concert
and
sports
hall
antonio
guterres
said
he
had
told
the
polish
presidency
of
the
talks
that
it
was
important
to
conclude
work
today
with
the
highest
possible
level
of
ambition
it
s
essential
for
me
that
katowice
is
not
a
failure
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
to
us
is
that
there
would
be
the
idea
of
chaos
the
idea
that
to
a
certain
extent
we
would
be
reproducing
in
katowice
what
happened
in
climate
talks
in
copenhagen
in
were
widely
regarded
as
a
failure
as
they
ended
with
a
agreement
it
took
six
more
years
to
clinch
a
deal
in
paris
the
katowice
draft
text
is
still
subject
to
change
but
requires
developed
countries
to
deliver
and
increase
on
a
promise
of
billion
a
year
of
climate
finance
to
help
poorer
countries
adapt
to
climate
change
by
and
rules
on
how
to
report
and
monitor
each
nation
s
greenhouse
gas
emissions
there
has
been
compromise
in
some
areas
such
as
tweaking
language
to
recognise
the
importance
of
a
report
by
the
un
s
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
on
limiting
global
warming
to
which
caused
rifts
last
week
greater
clarity
is
sought
on
what
countries
will
do
after
leaving
poland
and
how
they
will
strengthen
their
commitments
and
targets
under
the
pact
this
text
embeds
the
ipcc
s
report
and
recognises
that
commitments
need
to
be
updated
by
but
fails
to
commit
countries
here
and
now
to
ramping
up
action
said
jennifer
morgan
executive
director
at
greenpeace
international
sticking
points
for
countries
most
vulnerable
to
climate
change
include
reference
to
a
mechanism
to
find
ways
to
cover
the
growing
costs
of
loss
and
damage
the
stepping
up
of
rich
nations
emissions
targets
and
climate
finance
we
do
not
want
to
see
the
paris
agreement
watered
down
