corrected-high stakes: risk in nasdaq's nordic power market boomed before default
oslo
reuters
risk
levels
in
nasdaq
s
nordic
commodities
market
had
more
than
doubled
in
the
six
months
prior
to
a
top
trader
s
default
in
november
the
result
of
a
rapid
accumulation
of
bets
amid
soaring
electricity
prices
the
exchange
told
reuters
nasdaq
conducts
daily
stress
tests
calculating
market
risk
adjusting
every
quarter
a
buffer
to
shield
the
market
from
breaking
down
in
case
of
defaults
like
the
one
that
caused
a
million
euro
million
loss
in
september
but
the
stress
tests
which
are
not
made
available
to
traders
may
be
insufficient
some
of
them
told
reuters
asking
for
more
transparency
and
better
risk
control
on
march
the
default
fund
amounted
to
just
million
euros
had
the
level
stayed
unchanged
einar
aas
the
trader
who
defaulted
would
have
hit
the
market
with
a
loss
the
buffers
couldn
t
match
triggering
a
deeper
crisis
seeing
higher
risk
levels
nasdaq
on
june
increased
clearing
members
default
fund
requirement
to
million
euros
and
on
upped
it
again
to
million
euros
these
were
the
only
two
occasions
on
which
members
were
warned
of
the
increased
risk
nasdaq
identified
prior
to
the
default
aside
from
regular
market
notices
the
increase
in
stress
values
was
primarily
driven
by
two
factors
a
general
increase
in
the
price
levels
in
the
power
markets
which
directly
feed
into
increased
stress
numbers
and
increased
underlying
exposure
increased
size
of
positions
among
the
members
nasdaq
said
aas
had
triggered
alerts
in
the
stress
tests
due
to
his
large
positions
but
was
not
the
only
trader
to
do
so
it
added
investors
had
significantly
increased
their
positions
over
six
months
nasdaq
said
and
while
the
size
itself
was
no
cause
for
concern
it
coincided
with
a
fall
in
liquidity
making
it
hard
for
individual
traders
to
exit
positions
on
when
spreads
between
nordic
and
german
power
contracts
widened
sharply
an
event
nasdaq
later
described
as
a
black
swan
aas
was
unable
to
unload
his
portfolio
a
systemic
collapse
was
avoided
nasdaq
said
thanks
to
the
stress
tests
that
caused
the
buffer
s
readjustment
betting
that
spreads
would
shrink
the
opposite
of
what
happened
had
been
common
traders
said
others
avoided
big
losses
as
they
managed
to
close
their
positions
due
to
their
smaller
size
we
had
a
position
that
included
the
spread
that
we
closed
one
week
before
what
happened
it
should
come
together
but
it
continued
to
widen
if
you
are
a
trader
you
either
put
more
money
in
it
or
you
sell
portfolio

while
more
defaults
were

traders
said
they
were
unhappy
with
nasdaq
s
handling
of
the
matter
and
level
of
transparency

that

saying
nasdaq
had

it
