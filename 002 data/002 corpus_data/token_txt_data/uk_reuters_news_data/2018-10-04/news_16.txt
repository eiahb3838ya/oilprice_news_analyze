reuters
oil
traders
have
piled
into
wagers
that
crude
oil
could
surge
to
a
barrel
by
next
year
a
milestone
that
until
recently
many
considered
unthinkable
due
to
record
production
growth
and
relatively
flat
global
demand
but
the
imminent
return
of
sanctions
on
iran
and
bottlenecks
keeping
oil
from
getting
to
market
have
fueled
a
rally
that
has
taken
benchmark
oil
prices
to
highs
while
big
producing
nations
say
supply
is
ample
hedge
funds
and
speculators
are
increasingly
skeptical
of
that
argument
betting
the
market
could
rally
further
as
sanctions
on
iran
s
crude
exports

there
s
been
a

some

china
are
not

these

dropped
to

in

from

the

finance
said
estimates
for
how
much
of
iran
s
exports
could
be
affected
range
from
bpd
to
million
bpd
and
uncertainty
over
the
impact
could
ultimately
foster

we
continue
to
