feature-on the road to zero carbon, portland pinches off fossil fuels

three
years
ago
a
group
of
eighth
graders
came
before
portland
s
city
council
to
ask
for
something
unusual
a
ban
on
new
facilities
to
transport
or
store
fossil
fuels
in
the
city
quoting
seuss
singing
bob
dylan
s
the
times
they
are
a
changing
and
performing
a
short
play
set
years
in
the
future
they
told
the
officials
fossil
fuels
had
no
place
in
a
world
struggling
with
climate
change
or
in
portland
s
future
later
that
day
city
officials
unanimously
voted
for
the
ban
this
is
the
first
stone
in
a
green
wall
of
resistance
against
fossil
fuel
facilities
on
the
west
coast
promised
charlie
hales
who
heralded
the
ordinance
as
an
example
of
how
cities
can
take
action
against
climate
change
today
more
than
cities
around
the
world
including
portland
have
pledged
to
become
carbon
neutral
by
meaning
they
will
eliminate
nearly
all
fossil
fuel
emissions
and
offset
what
they
can
not
through
actions
such
as
planting
trees
each
city
is
pushing
toward
the
goal
in
its
own
way
to
help
meet
the
goals
of
the
paris
climate
agreement
which
aim
to
hold
off
the
worst
impacts
of
global
warming
from
fiercer
storms
to
more
frequent
crop
failures
but
the
road
to
becoming
a
zero
carbon
city
is
rarely
a
simple
or
easy
one
as
portland
has
discovered
after
passing
its
landmark
policy
which
banned
construction
of
new
fossil
fuel
facilities
in
the
city
portland
was
hit
by
a
legal
challenge
from
petroleum
trade
groups
and
a
local
business
coalition
the
groups
argued
the
city
had
overstepped
its
constitutional
bounds
by
effectively
blocking
interstate
commerce
an
argument
the
state
land
use
court
upheld
in
july
the
city
then
appealed
and
won
a
decision
ultimately
upheld
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
july
we
are
disappointed
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
declined
to
review
this
case
said
kara
siepmann
a
spokeswoman
for
the
western
states
petroleum
association
one
of
the
original
challengers
this
matter
remains
very
important
to
our
industry
the
city
of
portland
and
all
oregonians
who
rely
on
terminals
for
safe
and
reliable
access
to
fuel
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
via
the
portland
business
alliance
another
challenger
declined
to
comment
the
ruling
now
clears
the
way
for
portland
to
put
its
new
law
into
effect
but
only
after
years
of
delay
people
in
portland
fight
to
defend
what
we
love
from
dirty
fossil
fuel
projects
like
oil
train
terminals
said
dan
serres
conservation
director
for
columbia
riverkeeper
an
environmental
organization
that
joined
the
city
s
court
appeal
the
city
of
portland
made
history
when
it
adopted
the
fossil
fuel
ordinance
with
these
challenges
from
the
oil
industry
and
the
portland
business
alliance
out
of
the
way
portland
can
move
forward
toward
putting
this
policy
into
practice
he
said
turning
the
policy
into
action
in
the
city
however
will
bring
its
own
challenges
the
ordinance
calls
for
the
city
council
to
actively
oppose
expansion
of
infrastructure
whose
primary
purpose
is
transporting
or
storing
fossil
fuels
in
or
through
portland
or
adjacent
waterways
determining
what
projects
do
that
is
up
to
the
bureau
of
planning
and
sustainability
it
has
modified
the
city
s
zoning
code
to
restrict
what
it
calls
bulk
fossil
fuel
terminals
facilities
with
the
capacity
to
hold
more
than
million
gallons
million
litres
of
fuels
such
as
oil
natural
gas
or
propane
portland
doesn
t
aim
to
phase
out
fossil
fuels
entirely
just
yet
while
it
pledged
last
year
to
aim
for
percent
renewable
energy
on
the
day
president
donald
trump
said
he
would
withdraw
the
united
states
from
the
paris
agreement
portland
for
now
still
needs
existing
oil
and
natural
gas
distribution
networks
to
heat
homes
and
fuel
automobiles
but
we
have
enough
portland
city
planner
tom
armstrong
who
worked
on
the
zoning
code
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
an
interview
banning
new
fossil
fuel
infrastructure
supports
the
city
s
percent
renewable
pledge
and
its
climate
action
plan
but
it
s
also
aimed
at
reducing
another
risk
from
earthquakes
climate
action
issues
aside
our
port
facilities
are
not
located
in
the
best
place
when
it
comes
to
seismic
risk
armstrong
said
when
the
city
studied
existing
riverfront
oil
and
gas
terminals
researchers
discovered
they
all
sit
on
land
susceptible
to
liquefaction
when
saturated
soil
begins
acting
like
a
liquid
during
an
earthquake
with
portland
situated
near
a
major
fault
zone
off
the
west
coast
zoning
is
about
ensuring
public
health
and
safety
and
that
s
what
we
re
trying
to
do
in
portland
armstrong
said
no
one
wants
a
fossil
fuel
terminal
exploding
in
their
backyard
mia
reback
of
the
local
chapter
of
a
climate
activist
organisation
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
constellation
of
oil
tanks
propane
terminals
and
liquid
natural
gas
plants
along
portland
s
willamette
river
lies
just
a
few
miles
from
the
city
s
downtown
with
its
trendy
food
trucks
and
artisanal
doughnut
shops
serres
and
city
planner
armstrong
say
they
have
noticed
an
increase
in
oil
trains
moving
through
the
city
some
carrying
fuel
from
canada
s
alberta
tar
sands
bound
for
ships
to
asia
and
elsewhere
serres
believes
portland
s
geography
at
the
confluence
of
the
willamette
and
columbia
rivers
along
the
flattest
route
between
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
pacific
ocean
makes
it
uniquely
positioned
to
slow
down
worldwide
distribution
of
fossil
fuels
we
sit
between
large
international
markets
overseas
in
asia
and
globally
significant
fossil
fuel
reserves
in
the
middle
of
the
north
american
continent
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
armstrong
does
not
see
the
city
s
role
as
disrupting
that
flow
of
commerce
but
we
do
have
a
say
in
how
land
gets
used
in
our
city
he
said
portland
is
not
the
only
city
looking
at
the
question
vancouver
a
city
on
the
north
side
of
the
columbia
river
in
the
state
of
washington
banned
bulk
oil
terminals
in
other
ports
along
the
lower
columbia
are
also
considering
whether
to
accept
facilities
ranging
from
coal
terminals
to
methanol
refineries
but
so
far
portland
has
taken
the
strongest
line
against
them
the
portland
ordinance
was
the
first
time
we
saw
a
municipality
take
a
big
affirmative
step
to
say
no
we
re
going
to
move
in
a
different
direction
serres
said
allowing
the
expansion
of
fossil
fuel
facilities
could
add
cash
from
property
taxes
and
business
license
fees
to
portland
s
coffers
but
armstrong
said
he
does
not
think
the
ban
will
have
a
significant
financial
impact
on
the
city
what
is
more
worrisome
is
the
relatively
slow
progress
toward
the
city
s
percent
renewable
energy
pledge
local
climate
activists
say
they
are
pushing
a
citizen
s
initiative
on
the
november
election
ballot
that
would
tax
businesses
to
create
a
million
annual
clean
energy
fund
for
the
city
the
money
would
pay
to
install
rooftop
solar
arrays
weatherize
homes
and
offer
job
training
in
green
energy
fields
this
is
not
yet
reality
and
is
only
a
piece
of
what
s
needed
from
the
city
