a
unloading
of
treasuries
pushed
their
yields
to
multiyear
peaks
on
thursday
as
robust
economic
data
and
hawkish
speeches
by
federal
reserve
officials
stoked
concerns
about
inflation
hitting
wall
street
and
stock
markets
globally
the
yield
on
the
benchmark
note
hit
a
high
of
percent
following
data
released
the
previous
day
that
was
seen
as
increasing
the
odds
a
friday
payrolls
report
would
also
be
stronger
than
expected
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
said
the
economy
can
expand
for
quite
some
time
which
also
helped
the
yield
curve
steepen
to
its
highest
in
two
months
stocks
in
turn
have
fallen
broadly
with
the
dow
suffering
its
first
decline
in
six
sessions
and
both
the
s
p
and
nasdaq
seeing
their
worst
day
since
june
the
on
the
treasury
rates
today
actually
the
worldwide
on
treasuries
has
a
big
part
to
do
with
this

jj
kinahan
chief
market

at
td

in
chicago
the
dow

points
its
highest
surge
since
the
ftseurofirst
index
lost
percent
and
msci
gauge
of
stocks
across
the
globe
shed

the
surge
in
treasury
yields
has
also
prompted
a
rise
in
government
bond
yields
across
the
globe
we
saw
very
large
overnight
volumes
during
both
the
tokyo
and
london
trading
hours
which
was
a
catchup
in
foreign
sovereign
markets
to
the
very
large
in
treasuries
yesterday

euro
zone
bond
yields
rose
sharply
tracking
their
counterparts
while
the
spread
between
united
states
and
german
bond
yields
hit
a
high
of
around
bps
the
dollar
weakened
against
the
euro
and
yen
but
lingered
near
recent
highs
as
investors
digested
economic
data
and
powell
s
remarks
the
dollar
index
was
flat
with
the
euro
up
percent
to
the
japanese
yen
strengthened
percent
versus
the
greenback
at
per
dollar
investors
are
expected
to
scour
the
government
s
september
payroll
report
scheduled
for
release
on
friday
and
look
closely
for
signs
of
wage
growth
especially
in
light
of
anecdotal
indications
of
rising
wages
that
sense
of
the
market
s
rising
discomfort
about
inflation
risks
leads
me
to
expect
the
wage
inflation
reading
within
the
nonfarm
payrolls
on
friday
will
be
critical
to
the
current

the
exception
of
the
day
was
italy

borrowing

a

cut
budget

the
