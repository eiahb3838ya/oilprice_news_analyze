thursday
the
government
s
latest
step
to
tackle
the
impact
of
a
sharp
rise
in
crude
oil
prices
and
a
weak
local
currency
the
cut
includes
a
reduction
in
excise
duty
of
rupees
per
litre
which
will
reduce
government
revenue
by
billion
rupees
jaitley
said
refiners
will
also
cut
the
price
they
charge
by
rupee
per
litre
jaitley
also
asked
state
governments
to
cut
value
added
tax
on
fuel
by
a
further
rupees
per
litre
taxes
on
gasoline
and
diesel
which
account
for
more
than
a
third
of
retail
fuel
prices
are
one
of
the
biggest
sources
of
income
for
the
government
which
is
seeking
to
keep
the
country
s
budget
deficit
in
check
it
certainly
has
fiscal
implications
if
the
government
wishes
to
stick
to
its
glidepath
of
fiscal
consolidation
then
it
will
have
to
cut
its
expenditures
significantly

in
reaction
to
the
news
the
price

is
likely
to
result
in
a

global

grew
at
its

last
twelve
months

india
stopped
controlling

in

diesel
prices
in
linking
them
to
global
crude
markets
in
a
bid
to
ease
pressure
on
government
finances
and
improve
the
earnings
of
oil
refiners
but
analysts
said
the
announcement
on
thursday
shows
there
is
still
a
heavy
government
hand
in
the
industry
by
asking
the
oil
marketing
companies
to
absorb
the
price
hike
the
government
is
giving
a
signal
that
it
can
interfere
at
anytime
in
a
deregulated
market
in
the
larger
public
interest
said
gagan

a
senior
analyst
with
elara
capital
rising
gasoline
and
diesel
fuel
prices
have
been
a
cause
of
public
anger
with
people
in
parts
of
the
country
blocking
trains
and
vandalising
vehicles
in
protest
prime
minister
narendra
modi
s
ruling
bharatiya
janata
party
is
facing
a
tough
election
in
three
key
states
this
year
followed
by
a
national
election
which
is
due
by
may
asked
by
a
reporter
about
the
economic
implications
of
the
move
jaitley
said
the
decision
was
good
economics
as
it
won
t
impact
the
fiscal
deficit
and
will
allow
consumers
to
boost
spending
on
other
goods
devendra
kumar
pant
chief
economist
at
india
ratings
and
research
said
the
move
could
act
as
a
minor
comforting
factor
for
the
central
bank
during
its
monetary
policy
meeting
scheduled
on
friday
as
a
fuel
price
cut
will
ease
retail
inflation
the
national
reduction
translates
to
a
percent
cut
in
gasoline
prices
and
a
percent
fall
in
diesel
prices
in
india
s
capital
new
delhi
fuel
prices
are
not
uniform
across
the
country
due
to
variable
state
taxes
gasoline
was
sold
at
rupees
a
litre
while
diesel
was
sold
at
a
litre
on
october
according
to
retailer
indian
oil
corp
s
website
some
states
such
as
gujarat
chhattisgarh
tripura
uttar
pradesh
assam
and
maharashtra
ruled
by
modi
s
bjp
cut
their
own
taxes
following
the
federal
government
s
announcement
but
it
is
unclear
how
many
of
india
s
states
will
meet
the
request
though
some
had
in
recent
weeks
already
reduced
their
take
i
hope
all
state
governments
do
this
and
they
announce
this
so
that
consumers
benefit
by
rupees
