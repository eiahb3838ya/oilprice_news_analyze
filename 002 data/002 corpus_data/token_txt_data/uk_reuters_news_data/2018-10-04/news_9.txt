the

units
westinghouse
which
is
located
outside
pittsburgh
provides
fuel
services
and
nuclear
power
plant
design
to
customers
including
ukraine
we
have
found
no
evidence
that
the
phishing
campaigns
against
employees
to
breach
westinghouse
s
systems
were
successful
the
company
said
in
a
statement
it
added
that
it
is
cooperating
with
the
justice
department
but
could
not
go
into
specifics
because
the
investigation
is
ongoing
three
of
the
seven
russian
military
officers
indicted
on
thursday
were
charged
in
a
separate
case
brought
by
special
counsel
robert
mueller
s
office
for
their
role
in
hacking
activities
designed
to
influence
the
presidential
election
john
demers
the
head
of
the
justice
department
s
national
security
division
said
while
the
defendants
overlap
the
case
brought
on
thursday
did
not
involve
mueller
s
office
in
the
indictment
prosecutors
alleged
that
one
of
the
russian
officers
ivan
sergeyevich
yermakov
who
was
also
charged
by
mueller
in
the
hacking
performed
technical
reconnaissance
on
westinghouse
to
gain
access
to
ip
addresses
domains
and
network
ports
starting
in
november
in
december
the
hackers
registered
a
fake
domain
and
website
designed
to
mimic
the
company
s
website
and
sent
phishing
emails
to
at
least
five
employees
once
people
clicked
on
the
spoofed
domain
and
provided
their
they
were
rerouted
to
the
original
network
on
other
occasions
according
to
the
indictment
the
conspirators
also
sent
emails
to
the
personal
emails
of
employees
at
westinghouse
two
account
users
clicked
on
the
malicious
links
the
indictment
alleges
that
the
seven
defendants
all
of
whom
are
members
of
russia
s
military
intelligence
agency
sought
to
sow
disinformation
and
create
an
influence
campaign
as
retaliation
for
the
exposure
of
a
russian
athlete
doping
programme
the
agency
and
the
world
agency
were
among
their
hacking
targets
as
well
sporting
organizations
including
the
federation
internationle
de
football
association
fifa
and
athletes
whose
medical
records
were
stolen
and
later
publicized
russia
has
denied
meddling
in
the
presidential
election
contradicting
a
unanimous
conclusion
by
intelligence
agencies
all
seven
of
the
defendants
are
presumed
to
be
in
russia
which
does
not
have
an
extradition
treaty
with
the
united
states
the
indictment
could
make
it
hard
for
them
to
travel
to
other
countries
the
hackers
travelled
to
other
countries
to
carry
out
hacking
activities
sometimes
with
the
use
of
diplomatic
passports
prosecutors
allege
such
efforts
known
as
or
close
access
hacking
operations
were
carried
out
in
cases
where
remote
hacking
from
russia
did
not
provide
sufficient
access
to
networks
one
such
trip
for
instance
was
rio
de
janeiro
before
and
during
the
summer
olympic
games
some
of
the
stolen
data
was
later
published
under
the
false
auspices
of
a
hacktivist
group
known
as
fancy
bears
hack
close
access
operations
like
the
ones
exposed
today
are
reminders
of
the
considerable
resources
available
to
nation
states
said
john
hultquist
director
of
intelligence
analysis
at
the
cyber
firm
fireeye
while
the
motive
behind
the
hacks
involving
groups
and
organizations
probing
russian
poisonings
were
more
the
decision
to
target
westinghouse
was
less
apparent
justice
department
officials
declined
to
provide
additional
details
on
thursday
about
the
attacks
on
the
company
efforts
to
penetrate
its
networks
started
in
late
some
nine
months
after
ukraine
s
president
viktor
yanukovych
was
removed
from
power
during
the
ukrainian
revolution
this
is
not
the
first
time
westinghouse
has
been
a
victim
of
a
hack
in
may
the
justice
department
indicted
five
chinese
military
hackers
who
targeted
nuclear
power
metals
and
solar
sectors
according
to
that
indictment
westinghouse
had
entered
into
a
deal
with
a
chinese
nuclear
company
to
construct
and
run
four
nuclear
power
plants
in
china
but
during
the
talks
prosecutors
say
one
of
the
defendants
stole
proprietary
and
confidential
technical
designs
and
other
data
from
westinghouse
